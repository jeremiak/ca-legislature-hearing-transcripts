THANK YOU FOR- YOUR COMMENTS IN SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO MAY WISH TO TALK IN OPPOSITION- YOU CAN WRITE THE COMMITTEE. SO WITH THAT SENATORS- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR MELENDEZ. IT THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION- FOR THE AUTHOR FINING. THROUGH WHICH TAKE QUESTION SURE. WHAT'S COMMITTEE HEARINGS I HOPE YOU TAKE A QUESTION- SO. THE IGEST OF YOUR BILL SAYS THAT IT REQUIRES CALVET CORPORATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ORANGE COUNTY FOR THE ACQUISITION STUDY DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION EQUIPPING- FOR THIS CEMETERY. AND THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING LAW SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE BILL DO. BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE DIGESTIVE TELLS ME WHEN IT DOES BUT YOU SAID SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN YOUR OPENING SO I JUST WONDER WHERE IN THE BILL. IS THERE SOMETHING I'M NOT SEEING SO I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT- IF YOU HAVE A BILLING FIVE PAGE TWO. IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION ONE WHERE IT SAYS FOURTEEN TEN. EIGHTY ONE THE BOTTOM IT SAYS IN THE CITY OF IRVINE ACCORDING TO THE CITY'S ENACTED LAWS AND ORDINANCES. MISSY THAT FORTUNE YES SO WHAT THE CONTROVERSY HAS BEEN- RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S A REAL CONTROVERSY BUT THE CONTROVERSY HAS BEEN AS TO WHETHER OR NOT CALVET OR THE CITY OF IRVINEIS GOING TO CHOOSE A LOCATION. WITHIN THE CITY OF IRVINE- THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IN THE CITY OF IRVINE. THAT THE CITY WILL CHOOSE LOCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS ENACTED LAWS AND ORDINANCES- WE'VE WE'VE ASKED CALVET TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT CALVET IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT CHOICE THAT CITIES CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE BUT- THERE'S BEEN SOME. RELUCTANCE TO DO SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. OKAY BUT THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY. THE CITY ONLY WILL CHOOSE THE LOCATION AND NOT COUNT THAT WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE ISSUE IS RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT WHAT IT SAYS IS- THAT THE STATE OPERATED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS CEMETERY WHICH SHALL BE LOCATED IN THE CITY OF OUR WINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CITY'S ENACTED LAWS AND ORDINANCES. OKAY- OKAY IJUST I YOU KNOW I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE- AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF THE PING PONG. THAT'S BEEN TAKING PLACE IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH RESPECT TO THIS CEMETERY WHICH IS- DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST BECAUSE- RIVERSIDE NATIONAL SERVICE THE MAJORITY OF. THE VETERANS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES IS EVEN ACCEPTING- PEOPLE NOW I QUIT UNDER VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WE DO NEED ANOTHER CEMETERY I JUST I GUESS AT. I AM VERY CONFUSED AS I'M SURE YOU MUST BE AS TO WHY THE CITY AND CALVET AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED CAN'T COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT BECAUSE THIS IS TAKING. A VERY LONG TIME AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE FOND OF THINKING ARE VETERANS FOR SERVICE IN- I THINK YOUR ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS THE BEST WAY TO THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE TO PROVIDE A PLACE FOR THEM FOR THEIR FINAL RESTING PLACE- SO I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY ALTHOUGH I I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU AND TELL YOU I JUST. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT DOES ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BUT IF IT HELPS MOVE THE PROCESS ALONG I'M HAPPY TO BE ON BOARD WITH THAT- AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN. USE YOUR INFLUENCE TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY SHOULD STOP BICKERING ABOUT IT AND GET SOMETHING DONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THURMOND IS I AGREE WITH YOU 1100% BOB ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN. MOVING FORWARD IS THAT- WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE. UNTIL THE CITY OF IRVINE DESIGNATES A LOCATION- THEY HAVE BEEN. DISCUSSING THIS FOR A LONG TIME THERE BEEN MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO MOVE THE CEMETERY TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE ANY CONFUSION WHATSOEVER AS TO WHO. MAKES THAT DECISION IS LOCATION THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS CITY OF IRVINE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION RECENTLY THERE WAS A MOTION ON CITY COUNCIL AND I. DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ADOPTED OR NOT BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S SEVERAL MEMBERS WHO SUPPORTED THE MOTION. CALVET BASICALLY THE CITY WOULD FOLLOW CALVET SLEEP CALVET IS NOT GOING TO DESIGNATE A LOCATION CALVET IS GOING TO DO A STUDY. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THE DECISION TO BE MADE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND I THINK THE VOTERS ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT THIS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE DONE SELL. ITEMS YES I THINK THAT'S TRUE- I THINK THERE'S ALREADY- ORDINANCES ENACTED BUT- THIS IS TO. ELIMINATE ANY ISSUE AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING A LOCATION OKAY AND JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY DOES- NO RELATION TO HOW I WOULD VOTE ON THE BILL BUT- GIVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT. STUDYING HIS AND PROVIDING REPORTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE UP TO THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW UP TO THIS POINT I DO KNOW THAT THAT THERE WAS A STUDY THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK THEE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT STUDY YES YEAH. OKAY SO IT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY SPENT WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT SO I HOPE THAT THEY- CAN PULL THIS OFF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER. YOUR ARE THERE ANY OTHER SENATORS WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IT'S NOT A CENTER BURKE DID YOU LIKE CLOTHES AND SENATE BILL FORTY THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THAT SENATOR MELENDEZ IS CORRECT THIS IS TAKEN TOO LONG AND WE WANT TO MOVE IT ALONG- THE CEMETERY- WILL PROVIDE SPACE FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IT'S A NOT JUST THE SPACE BUT IT'S ALSO THE COST COST EIGHT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BURIAL AND HAVING THAT BENEFIT. WHICH IS EARNED BY BLOOD AND SACRIFICE I THINK IS APPROPRIATE AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU NOT VOTE. GOOD DO WE HAVE A MOTION. TO MOVE THE BILL SENATOR EGGMAN- THANK YOU FOR THAT AND ONCE AGAIN- SENATORS PLEASE SPEAK IN THE MICROPHONE CONSULTANT CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. ARCHULETA BY WHICH A LOT OF HIGH GROWTH. I GROW HI EGGMAN THANKS MAN HI MELENDEZ MELENDEZ AYE NEWMAN NEWMAN AYE ROTH. ROTH HI NUMBER NUMBER I SEVEN ZERO THIRTY THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT- BILL IS OUT. SEVEN ZERO SEVEN ZERO AND- NEXT LET'S SEE WE HAVE. A CENTER GROVE CENTER GROVE YOU'RE READY TO PRESENT YOUR SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY EIGHT YES SIR OKAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU THEN YOU MAY PROCEED GOOD MORNING MISTER TERRY MEMBERS I AM TAKING IMPRISONING SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT WHICH IS BEING SPONSORED BY THE SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY SASSER RECORDER CLERK MISTER BOB DENTON A FORMER SENATOR. THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES COUNTY ASSESSOR'S TO OFFER PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTIONS TO DISABLED VETERANS PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF DISABILITY RATING PROVIDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR THE V. EIGHT. OR THE MILITARY SERVICE FROM WHICH THE VETERAN WAS DISCHARGED. OTHER STATES OFFER PROPERTY TAX CREDITS VEREEN IN VARYING DEGREES AND- MANY ALLOW VETERANS TO QUALIFY WITH DISABILITY RATINGS LESS THAN ILLINOIS AND TEXAS. CURRENTLY I'M DISABLED VETERANS MAY REQUEST A REDUCTION FOR THE HOME'S ASSESSED VALUE ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THAT PROPERTY TAX. ONLY IF THEY ARE 1100% DISABLED BLIND IN BOTH EYES ARE HAVE LOST TWO OR MORE LIMBS. IF THE DECEASED VETERAN IS HAS A SURVIVING SPOUSE THEY CAN ALSO QUALIFY UNDER THOSE SAME STANDARDS. HOWEVER WITHOUT THIS BILL A VETERAN WITH A LIFE CHANGING 50% DISABLED RATING WOULD CONTINUE TO BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION. ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DATA. THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND VETERANS WHO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DISABILITY RATING AND IF THEY ON PROPERTY WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND VETERANS WHO WOULD BE INELIGIBLE AND OUR CURRENT LAW. AT THE SAME TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE V. A. ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND HOMELESS VETERANS WHICH- WAS FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THE HIGHEST NEXT STATE US. SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT WOULD BE THE COULD BE THE ONE SAVING GRACE FOR VETERAN IN HELPING THEM KEEPING THEIR HOME AND GETTING THEM THROUGH THE HARDSHIP UNTIL THEY CAN GET BACK ON THEIR FEET- WE ALL ARE WE'RE A WELL WE'RE AWARE OF THE SACRIFICES THAT OUR VETERANS MAKE. WHEN THEY SWEAR TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY EVERYONE OF US ON THIS FLOOR HAS MADE THAT SEEM. BOTH TO THIS COUNTRY. WHAT WE MUST DO AND WHAT WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER IS THAT MANY VETERANS STRUGGLE TO ADJUST BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE. THIS TRANSITION CAN BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE INJURED WHILE SERVING- SERVING OR THOSE THAT STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SUCH AS PTSD. THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL BENEFIT THE CAN EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF LOSS ARE DISABLED VETERANS FACE SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO STRUGGLING VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT PASS OUT OF SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE A GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE WITH THE FIVE ZERO BIPARTISAN VOTE- WE RECEIVE NO NO VOTES YET IN A FORMER STATE SENATOR BOB DENTON HE'S THE ASSESSOR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO ME. IS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL IN THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT AND HE'LL BE TESTIFYING BE VIA TELEPHONE SIR. MISTER BURTON ARE YOU ON THE LINE READY TO DEFY. YES I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD. OKAY WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF S. B. AS SIX FIFTY EIGHT- IS- CENTER GROVE IT INDICATED THAT I'M CURRENTLY THE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY ASSESSOR RECORDER. WELL LET THE LEGISLATURE- IN ASSUME THESE RESPONSIBILITIES A COUPLE YEARS LATER I PARTICIPATE A LOT IN THE VETERAN RESOURCE FAIRS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTY. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY KNEW WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH AVAILABLE AND IT WAS REALLY- IT WAS REALLY DISHEARTENING TO ME THAT- HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WAS A TELL THERE'S REALLY AND NOTHING I HAVE FOR YOU OTHER THAN A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR EXEMPTION WHICH THEY TOOK THE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR HOMEOWNERS EXEMPTION. THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THAT EITHER. SO IT JUST FELT TO ME LIKE IN FAIRNESS. WE ARE LOOK AT DOING SOMETHING AND SO. I DID TALK TO- THE SENATE GROW ABOUT- KERRY IN THIS BILL- THIS WOULD EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY OF DISABLED VETERANS. EXEMPTION BY ALLOWING THE COUNTY ASSESSOR TO APPLY A PARTIAL. DISABILITY VETERANS EXEMPTION EQUAL TO THE PERCENTAGE OF DISABILITY THE VETERAN IS RATED. ABOUT THAT READING IS DETERMINED BY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. AND THE MILITARY AND THEN THEY'LL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AND CURRENTLY HAS A SAID THE DISABLED VETERANS EXAM EXEMPTION IS ONLY AVAILABLE. TO SOMEBODY WHO IS A 100% DISABLED. AND SO IT'S REALLY I THINK IN A FAIRNESS ISSUE NOW HERE IN SEMINOLE COUNTY WE HAVE ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND VETERANS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE HOMEOWNERS- BUT THE ONLY FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE VETERANS HAVE A 100% DISABILITY RATING. WHICH IS ONLY ROUGHLY ABOUT 16% OF OUR VETERANS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD TODAY FOUR PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY AND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. THAT WAS WHEN I SIR- I SERVED DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DURING THE TIME WE STILL HAD A DRAFT THAT WE WERE FEEDING OUT TO AN ALL VOLUNTEER SERVICE TODAY'S. NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL. THEY ARE OUT OUT THERE DOING THAT ONLY WORK FOR US TO HELP US WITH NATURAL DISASTERS AND THINGS LIKE THIS BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE ASKED TO BE CALLED INTO DUTY- THE DEFEND THIS COUNTRY AND BE OF SERVICE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TWO. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IN FAIRNESS CALIFORNIA IN THE GREAT STATE IT IS IT IS IT IS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS LIKE EIGHTY OR 90% DISABILITY- BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST IT IT JUST ISN'T THAT MUCH MONEY IN THE TOTAL SCOPE OF THINGS BUT IT IS A LOT OF MONEY. SOMETIMES TO THESE TO THESE VETERANS ESPECIALLY THE DISABLED VETERAN COMMUNITY. SO I JUST LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS ORDER THANK SENATOR GROWTH. OF HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR HEARING THIS- THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO. THANK YOU MISTER FOR YOUR- AND NOW WILL CONTINUE ON WITH THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT- ANYONE ELSE I'M GOING TO ALLOW THREE MINUTES.
