ALL RIGHT MELONES WALL DEFENDER FOR THE GREAT SERVICE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OBJECTION WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM FORTY FIVE SB TWO SEVEN SIX CENTER PAN ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THIS ITEM. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ IN A BILL TO SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR PAN AND ACT WILLING TO PUBLIC HEALTH. DR. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS SIDE RISE TO BRING YOU SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WHICH IS BACK ON CONCURRENT FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TAKEN UP IN THE ASSEMBLY SINCE THIS BILL LAST WAS VOTED ON AND PASSED OUT OF OUR SENATE SO WE I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ON THE SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO SIGN THE BILL THE POINT WHEN WE TOOK THOSE AT ON PASSAGE OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE I WILL SUMMER I WANT TO JUST GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FIRST OF ALL THE BILL IS PARTICULARLY FOCUSED NOW ON. EITHER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE A INNOVATION RATE BELOW 95% THE RATE. THE SERVER COMMUNITY. OR IF IT'S ISSUED BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS SUBMITTED MORE THAN FIGHT EXEMPTIONS IN THAT YEAR. THE BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT PHYSICIANS MAY NOT CHARGE SEPARATE FEES FOR ISSUING EXEMPTIONS OR FOR PHYSICAL PHYSICAL EXAMS RELATED TO BUNDLE OF TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS. THE GUIDELINES ARE ACTUALLY BROADENED TO ALSO INCLUDE THE GUIDELINES AND AMERICAN CAD PEDIATRICS. IN STANDARD OF CARE WHICH BASICALLY MEANS AS LONG AS A REASONABLE POSITION WHAT ISSUE SUCH AN EXEMPTION IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. IF AN EXEMPTION IS DECIDED TO BE REVOKED CHILDREN MAY CONTINUE ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR THIRTY DAYS BEYOND THAT DECISION. AND CHILDREN CAN CONTINUE EXEMPTION TEND SCHOOL WHILE THE EXEMPTION IS IN THIS BOTH REVIEW AND APPEAL PROCESS SO IN OTHER WORDS ONCE EXEMPTION SUBMITTED THAT IS VALID UNTIL IT IS REJECTED FINALLY. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE'VE CREATED ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT EXPERT REVIEW PANEL SO IT'S NOT ONLY REVIEWED BY PUBLIC HEALTH THEY CAN THEN APPEAL TO AND FEEL PANEL. OF PHYSICIANS PRACTICING PHYSICIANS APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THEY'LL DO THE FINAL REVIEW BASED ON THE CHEN STANDARD OF CARE. SO THOSE ARE THE A MAJOR AMENDMENTS SOFTLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON CONCURRENCE WITH ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE. SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I WAS A. A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN. BEING A PHARMACIST FOR. ALMOST THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AS A- GIVEN ME THE KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IMMUNIZATIONS OF SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES NOT ONLY AND THE UNITED STATES BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. BUT WHEN WE PASS SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WE MADE SOME PROMISES. AND THOSE PROMISES WERE THAT IF YOU HAD A CHILD THAT HAD AN ADVERSE REACTION TO. A VACCINATION OR COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT FROM A VACCINATION THAT YOU COULD. HAVE A AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL YOUR DOCTOR. AND IF YOUR DOCTOR SOLID FOOT UNSATISFIED APPROPRIATE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EXEMPTION THAT HE WOULD GRANT YOU THAT EXEMPTION. AND YOU CAN STILL ENROLL YOUR CHILD IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. NOW I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THE SIDE EFFECTS IMMUNIZATIONS. OUR RARE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF IMMUNIZATIONS THAT ARE GIVEN THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND GIVEN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I CHAIRED THE- COMMITTEE MEETING. WHEN YOU SEE THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE THAT DO HAVE INCIDENTS. THEY'RE NOT MINOR. THEIR MAJOR. YOU CAN HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. FOR EXEMPTIONS THE CDC HAS GUIDELINES BUT WE STILL NEED TO ALLOW PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE. WE NEED TO HAVE POSITIONS HAVE A PATIENT PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP. NOW AS YOU ALL KNOW I'M NOT ONLY A PHARMACIST BUT I'M PRACTICING PHARMACIST IN I HAVE TO ADHERE TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A ARE IMPOSED. AND AS THEY ARE ENFORCED BY THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY DOESN'T DELEGATE ANY OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY. TO ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IF YOU'RE FILING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST A PHARMACIST FOR EXAMPLE. SELLING MORPHINE OR BY CAN ENTER OXYCONTIN OUT THE BACK DOOR. A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION. TO THE. ISSUE OF SOME. UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS THAT WILL WRITE AN EXEMPTION FOR A FEE. IS TO LEAN ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD IS THERE FOR. TWO POLICE IF YOU WELL. THE PHYSICIANS THAT OUR LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING QUALITY MEDICAL CARE. LET ME TELL YOU. JUST BECAUSE I GET A PRESCRIPTION. FOR OXYCONTIN. DOES NOT ME I HAVE A MANDATE UNDER LAW TO DISPENSE THAT PRESCRIPTION FOR OXYCONTIN. I HAVE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS. WHEN A PATIENT COMES IN IF I NOTICE TO THE DISCUSS THE PRESCRIPTION FOR OXYCONTIN THREE DAYS AGO IN THIS POST IT LAST FALL BABIES I CAN POLITELY GIVE THE PRESCRIPTION BACK AND SAY I'M SORRY I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL THAT PRESCRIPTION BY LAW. IF I FEEL THAT PRESCRIPTION. I COULD HAVE A STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY INSPECTOR IN MY PHARMACY. WRITING ME A VIOLATION. HAVING AN ACCUSATION MIGHT BE AGAINST ME AND MY PHARMACY. AND THE POWER OF THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY IS IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY COULD BE THE SUSPEND YOUR LICENSE OR IN A WORST CASE SITUATION THEY CAN REVOKE YOUR LICENSE. SO QUESTION THAT ALL OF US HAVE. IS WHY ARE WE EMPOWERING THE MEDICAL BOARD TO POLICE THEIR OWN. TO ME THIS OF ADMISSION. BUT THE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T EITHER WANT TO ENFORCE THESE PROVISIONS. OR THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF ENFORCING THESE PROVISIONS. BY NOW GIVING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF REVIEWING WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD COULD BE REVIEWING IS BASICALLY TELLING THOSE. THE ARE STRONGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS THEIR CHILDREN'S WELFARE IF THEY HAVE TWO CHILDREN THAT HAVE HAD ADVERSE REACTIONS TO. IMMUNIZATIONS AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A RASH OF TALKING ABOUT ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. IF I WERE A PARENT I WOULD SEEK. AN EXEMPTION SO WHAT ARE THE PARENTS GONNA DO NOW WHEN THE ANSWER IS NO. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO APPEAL TO A LARGE BUREAUCRACY AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH A- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VEHICLES PROCEDURE TO SAFEGUARD THEIR CHILD. IF THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THEIR KIDS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. AGAIN FOLKS. I REALLY I BELIEVE IN IMMUNIZATIONS I BELIEVE THEY SAVE LIVES BUT THERE ARE RARE INSTANCES WHERE. A EXCLUSION IS MANDATED NECESSARY. IF WE HAVE PHYSICIANS THAT ARE ABUSING THEIR AUTHORITY IN WRITING THESE EXEMPTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOOD MEDICAL PRACTICE THE NOT MEDICAL BOARD TO STEP IN. SUSPEND OR RE REVOKE THEIR LICENSES. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL CURE THE PROBLEM IF YOU WILL OF INAPPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS BEING GIVEN. BUT EVERY PATIENT THE GOES TO A DOCTOR IS UNIQUE THE PRESENTS WITH VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE CAN'T DOCUMENT EVERY SINGLE SIDE EFFECT THAT HAPPENS WITH EVERY DRUG. BUT WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO BE READ THE ANSWER TO ASPIRIN THAT'LL SCARE YOU IF YOU READ THE ANSWER ON TYLENOL IT'LL SCARE YOU AS A CLAIMS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S LIVES. IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. BUT IF YOU TAKE A NUMBER OF THEM CONSIDER GIVEN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU ADVERTISE THAT TO SEE WHAT THE OVERALL HERD IMMUNITY. WOULD BE AS A RESULT. YOU STILL WOULD HAVE EFFECTIVE IMMUNITY. ARE PROTECTING. OUR CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. WHILE I SUPPORT THAT WE GIVE IMMUNIZATIONS TWO PEOPLE THAT CAN. SAFELY RECEIVE THEM. MAYBE SCATTERING. THE SCHEDULE BECAUSE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT GETTING TOO MANY IMMUNIZATIONS AT ONE TIME CAN OVERWHELM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF SOME OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS BUT MY FRIENDS WE SHOULD LET THE MEDICAL BOARD. DO WHAT THEY WERE APPOINTED TO DO. AND THAT IS TO OVERSEE THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE TO ENSURE THAT QUALITY HEALTHCARE IS BEING DELIVERED TO EACH AND EVERY PATIENT WHETHER IT'S A CHILD OR AN ADULT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE PHYSICIANS THE ABROGATE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND CHARGE A FEE TO WRITE AN EXEMPTION BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT THE MONEY INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. THEN THEY SHOULD BE DISCIPLINED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD WE SHOULD BE HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY OFF TO A THIRD PARTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NAMELY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT'S AN ABROGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY BY THE MEDICAL BOARD AND FOR THOSE REASONS. I THINK COULD VOTE DOWN SB TWO SEVENTY SIX. CENTERS CENTER MORLOCK. PLEASE NO THE PLATOON CHAMBER DINNER MORE LOCK THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THIS YEAR I'VE LEARNED A COUPLE NEW WORDS. WHICH IS KIND OF A HOBBY TO LEARN NEW WORDS. A ONE IS A FRESH SHE. BE A GOOD SENATOR FROM SANOMA CAME UP TO ME RECENTLY AND SAID. I SPREADSHEET YOU HAD A PRESSURE THIS WEEKEND I SAID WHAT IS A PRICEY THAT IS. A HAIR CUT RIGHT NO MATTER IT'S IN THE DICTIONARY. IN OTHER WORDS I'VE LEARNED THIS YEAR ANAPHYLAXIS OR ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. COLLEAGUES THAT MANY OF YOU LIKE MYSELF SLIDE OF SACRAMENTO IN BACK ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WHEN I STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO I. SORT OF LOOK FORWARD TO MY BAG OF PEANUTS. AND IT WAS SORT OF MY BREAKFAST ON THE WAY UP. AND SO IT WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WHEN THEY WOULD SAVE SORRY WE'RE NOT HANDING OUT PEANUT CITY BECAUSE SOMEONE ON THE PLANE. HAS A PEANUT ALLERGY. AND I KIND OF DIDN'T REACT WELLS LIKE. WHAT ABOUT MY ATTENDANT WITH HIM YOUR BAG ON THE WAY OUT. BUT I'M NOT A REAL FAN OF THEIR PRETZELS. BUT TERM NOW THEY'RE NOT EVEN OFFERING PEANUTS AT ALL THE END OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAS BECAUSE SOUTHWEST AIRLINES TO DO THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY SOMEONE IN THE ONE POINT 4% OF THE POPULATION. THAT HAVE A PEANUT ALLERGY. HAS. GREAT ENOUGH OF THE STORY THAT WE JUST DON'T GET PEANUTS WHATSOEVER SO THAT TO STARTED. ME THINKING SOME PEOPLE ARE SO ALLERGIC. THAT ACCORDING TO WIKIPEDIA IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES DUE TO ITS PREVALENCE PERSISTENCY AND POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF ALLERGIC REACTION. PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS CAN INCLUDE ITCHINESS HIVES SWELLING EXCIMER SNEEZING ASTHMA ABDOMINAL PAIN DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE DIARRHEA AND CARDIAC ARREST ANAPHYLAXIS IS A SERIOUS LIFE THREATENING ALLERGIC REACTION SO I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE PEANUT. INTOLERANT PEOPLE BECAUSE I COULDN'T HAVE MY LITTLE BAG OF PEANUTS ON THE WAY TO AND FROM BUT I CAN'T WATCH A COMMERCIAL ANYMORE ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS WITHOUT HEARING WARNINGS ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO EITHER THE MEDICATION OR ITS INGREDIENTS. TERM BY A. DON'T USE IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO TRIM FIRE AVOID USE OF LIVE VACCINES IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH FROM FIRE. CHEN TAKES TO QUIT SMOKING ALLERGIC OR SERIOUS SKIN REACTIONS SOME CAN BE LIFE THREATENING. TO LISTEN HE FOR DIABETES TYPE TWO IFYOU ARE ALLERGIC TO TREELESS CITY THERE ARE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS. BEING A MEMBER OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS ARE JUST COMPLETING A BOOK BY ELLEN SACKS THE CENTER CANNOT HOLD IN. ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIA AND SHE TALKS ABOUT THE VEIN MEDICATION SHE WAS TAKING AND THE SIDE EFFECTS NOW CALLED TARDIVE. DYSKINESIA THE THINGS HAPPEN WITH CERTAIN DRUGS SO I AM I AM NOT OPPOSED. THE VACCINES IN FACT I'M A FORMER ROTARIAN WITH TEN YEARS OF PERFECT ATTENDANCE AND IT WAS OUR MISSION TO IRAQ TO CAPE POLIO FROM THIS PLANET. AND SO WE WORK REALLY HARD AND FOCUSED ON REMOVING POLIO BUT I. I I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT MEASLES BUT OF LATE MAYBE I SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT TYPHOID FEVER WITH SOME OF THE HOMELESS CAMPS WE SEE UP AND DOWN THE STATE. BUT I AM GETTING MISTER PRESIDENT VERY VERY. INCENTIVE TO ALLERGIC REACTIONS MY WIFE IS ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH SO WE'RE ALWAYS CAREFUL. AT MEAL FUNCTIONS. SO WHAT IF AN IMPRINT IS ALLERGIC TO A VACCINE OR ONE OF ITS INGREDIENTS. WOOD RIVER WHAT WE REALLY FORCE AN INJECTION REALLY. LAST WEEK I HAD MICHAEL IN MY OFFICE. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD HANDSOME POLITE. BUT ACTED LIKE A NON VERBAL TODDLER. THE VACCINE INDUCED AN ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. AND FOR HIM THERE WAS NO RE BOOT TO NORMAL. MICHAEL'S PARENTS HAVE LIVE WITH THE RESULTS IN A BRAISE MICHAEL LOVINGLY. SO HAVE MANY OTHER PARENTS. AND THEY WANT TO SPARE THEIR SIBLINGS OF THEIR PERMANENTLY IMPACTED CHILDREN. RAISING A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CHILD IS A MAJOR SACRIFICE AND FRUSTRATING. ALL THE MORE IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THAT'S WHY THEY COME HERE BY THE HUNDREDS ON THESE BILLS. THAT'S WHY THEY EVEN STAND ON CHAIRS AND CHANT. COLLEAGUES IF CERTAIN BAD ACTORS ARE SELLING MEDIC MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAN CURRENT PROCEDURES SHOULD BE UTILIZED TO WEED THEM OUT AS WAS ELOQUENTLY STATED BY MY PHARMACIST COLLEAGUES. THE SENATOR FROM TO MACULA LET'S BEEF UP THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD BUT SCARING. AND LIMITING MEDICAL PROFESSIONS WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TRYING TO PREVENT ANAPHYLAXIS IS IN MY OPINION LEGISLATIVE MALPRACTICE. WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING VULNERABLE INFERENCE NOT CONDEMNING THEM TO DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED LIFE'S. COLLEAGUES LET'S RELY ON OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IN THEIR INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PATIENTS. SB TWO SEVEN SIX ADDRESSES A PERCEIVED ABUSE OF SIMPSON WITH THE WRONG CURE THAT'S WHY I'M OPPOSED TO SB TWO SEVEN SIX THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK CENTER. CENTER OUR- FIVE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THE CENTER PANEL YOU TO QUESTION COURSE OKAY SO I WOKE UP THIS MORNING. ZARA CAL MATTERS THE MENTIONED A WHOLE SLEW OF AMENDMENTS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PUT FORWARD HI TO. THIS BILL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS I DATE SEEM VERY REASONABLE TO ME WHEN I SAW THAT I JUST ASSUME THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE WOULD BE COMING UP FOR SEVERAL DAYS GIVEN THE FACT THAT PRISON WE NEED TO COMMIT TO OUR SIGNATURE I JUST WANT TO GET UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WITH REGARDS TO THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND YOUR PLANTS OF THIS BILL. SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD INDICATE THAT WE WORK TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE ASSEMBLY AND MYSELF AS THE AUTHOR. ON THIS YEAR'S AMENDMENTS I JUST PRESENTED TO YOU FOR CONCURRENCE THE GOVERNOR IT INDICATED AFTER THE TOOK THOSE AMENDMENTS AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH THAT HE WOULD SIGN THE BILL. WHEN THE BILL THEN PROGRESS ON TO THE S. TO ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL. AMENDMENTS HOWEVER THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE DID NOT. FIVE PUT ANY AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL WHEN IT LIFTED OUT SUSPENSE. AFTER LEFT TO SPEND SIDE DID NOT RECEIVE. ANY CALL OR CONTACT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INDICATING THEY STILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN OF YESTERDAY OF COURSE THE BILL WAS PASSED OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. IT IS NOW HERE ON CONCURRENCE. I WAS WE CANNOT TAKE AMENDMENTS ON CONCURRENCE. I CERTAINLY AM ALWAYS OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE DID BEFORE WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT. THAT'S THE VIRGIN THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU THIS IS A BILL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AGREED TO. AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT TO SIGN CERTAINLY I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT HE IS RAISING AND SO CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. THE EVEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS INDICATED IN THEIR- COMMUNICATIONS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE SEEKING TO A MAN THIS BILL WITH ANY ADDITIONAL. AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD ANY SORT OF ADDITIONAL CLEAN UP. HAVE TO BE DONE IN ANOTHER VEHICLE CELL AGAIN I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL I CONCURRENT. SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LACK OF STABILITY IN DISCOURSE IN WASHINGTON. WE'VE SEEN IT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I TELL YOU THE VIDEO IN COVERAGE THAT I SAW OF HOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO WAS TREATED. HE'S ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. IN THIS THIS BODY CONVENES PRIOR IN SOLIDARITY WE STOOD WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THAT EVEN THOUGH MANY OF S DISAGREE WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS IS NOT HOW WE DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE DISAGREED WITH A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE CAN PASSIONATELY FINE VENUES TO EXPRESS THAT. BECOMING PHYSICAL IN TRYING TO INTIMIDATE OR LEGISLATORS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN BANANA REPUBLICS NOT IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY NOT THE UNITED STATES. SO HAVING SAID THAT. I STILL HAVE RESERVATIONS MY FRIEND ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO MACULA HAD INDICATED EARLIER THE SAME CONCERNS THAT I EXPRESS PRIOR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE DELEGATING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE THESE MEDICAL REVIEWS TO A BUREAUCRATIC BODY. WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD IS THE BODY THAT HAS THE APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION AND THE EXPERTISE PROFESSIONAL AM PRACTITIONER WAS. TO REVIEW WHETHER THESE EXEMPTIONS HAD BEEN FRIVOLOUSLY DOLED OUT. BY ANALOGY IF SOMEONE HAD A COMPLAINT AGAINST IN A TURNING LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUBMIT THEIR CLAIMS TO A BUREAUCRATIC BODY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE BAR. THE CALIFORNIA BAR. SO TOO I WOULD SK YOU EVEN AT THIS LATE STAGE ESPECIALLY AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AMENDMENTS. WOULD YOU CONSIDER REVISING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CREATE THE VENUE WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THERE COULD BE A PROPER REVIEW. OF SOMEONE MISS APPLYING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ABUSING THE PROCESS OF DOLING OUT EXEMPTIONS WHEN THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATE. I CAN ONLY ASK THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS AND WE'LL SEE HOW THE VOTE PLAYS OUT TODAY BUT GETTING BACK TO THE EARLIER POINT. I CAN DISAGREE WITH YOU. BUT YOU AND ARE NOT DISAGREEABLE. AND WE STAND WITH YOU IN OPPOSE ANY SETTLEMENT THAT TRIES TO INTIMIDATE A LEGISLATOR FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FROM DOING ITS PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. PICKCENTER SENATOR WINNER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH HI MISTER PRESIDENT ARE COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO SEVENTY SIX I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THE CENTER OF IN SACRAMENTO FOR HIS YEARS OF WORK IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HEALTHY AND SUSTAINING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF ABUSE AND THE PHYSICAL SAW WITH TEST THE CAPSTONE WE'RE GOING ON FOR YEARS IN TERMS OF THE HARASSMENT AND IT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. OUR COLLEAGUE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SCIENCE AND ABOUT WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE OR NOT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE POLITICS OF TODAY WE SEE THAT AROUND CLIMATE WE SEE IT HERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TO SPEW BASIC SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND WE HAVE SEEN IT ON THE DEBATES AROUND WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY TO REFRAIN FROM YELLING HEARING THE CHAMBER. WINTER YOU MAY CONTINUE INTO THE BATES ABOUT VACCINES WORKS AS A BULLY IN MISINFORMATION IS CIRCULATED ABOUT VACCINES AND WHAT THAT DOES IS DESIGNED TO CAUSE FEAR AND IT LEADS TO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THIS BILL AND IT IS ON ACCEPTABLE WE CAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINIONS PEOPLE AND BY ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN STOCKS AND IT DIANNE IS CLEAR THAT VACCINES WORK THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE. THEY SAVE ON ACCOUNTABLE LIVES HERE AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN. SEIZE POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASES. AS A THIS IS JUST A BASIC MATTER OF SCIENTIFIC FACT AN OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE SEEN. DIED AFTER SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WAS PASSED THAT WHEN ALL THESE BOGUS FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WERE GRANTED WE STARTED TO SEE MORE CASES OF THE MEASLES. A DISEASE THAT WE HAD EFFECTIVELY A RADIC HEATED KEEPS MAKING A COMEBACK BECAUSE OF THE MISINFORMATION AROUND VACCINES. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS BILL. BUT THIS BILL ONLY KICKS IN WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SOME SORT OF INDICATION OF A PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN THAT IS WRITING A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. IF THERE IS A HIGH VACCINATION RATE IN THE SCHOOL OR IF YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT WRITING A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE EXEMPTIONS THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN KICK IN THIS IS ABOUT THE BAD ACTOR PHYSICIANS. AND IT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT SAFE. FOR THE CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY CAN'T BE VACCINATED AND THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POINT. FOR THE VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY REQUIRE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION INCLUDING BABIES. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET. THE MEASLES VACCINE WHEN YOU'RE A NEW BORN YOU HAVE TO WAIT. AND SO THESE INDIVIDUALS WHETHER SOMEONE WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION YOU CAN GET BACK SENATE OR YOU HAVE A BABY. VISIT PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED AND WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHOOSING NOT TO GET VACCINES AND DOCTORS WHO ARE WRITING FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. YOU ARE DIRECTLY PUTTING IN DANGER THE PEOPLE AND THE BABIES WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED THIS BILL DOES NOT GET RID OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IT SIMPLY PUTS SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE SO THAT PHYSICIANS CANNOT COMMIT FRAUD. AND SO THAT WE DO NOT SEE A RESURGENCE OF THESE DEADLY DISEASES I ASKED FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU SENATOR MORROW. THANK YOU HI COLLEAGUES THE OB MAKE MY COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE I JUST WANNA PICKING OUT OF BACK ON WHAT A- FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID BUT THE THING THAT I WANT TO JUST MY MAIN POINT IS THIS SO MANY THINGS THAT THIS BODY DOES YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT THE CONSTITUTION SPOTS BEING LIMITED BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BODY INSERTS ITSELF IN ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE LIVES OF AMERICANS TODAY. AND WE OVERSTEP OUR BOUNDARY I THINK. TOO OFTEN ESPECIALLY I IT IT DOES WORRY ME THAT THIS BODY BELIEVES WRAPS THEY KNOW MORE THAN PERRANCE IN A DOCTOR. AND SO WE NEED TO GET BACK LADIES AND GENTLEMAN TO THE TO THE PARENTS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR DOCTOR NOT A BODY OF POLITICIANS THAT HAVE COME FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE. IN FEW OF THEM THAT ARE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SO I RESERVE MY COMMENTS SIR IT TOOK TO JUST THAT AND I WILL BE A STRONG. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR DALLY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AYE. HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WHAT WAS HER HERE AND THEN I CAME TO THE SENATE. IS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO. SHARE WITH THE BODY THAT. I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS A ANTI BOXER I MY CHILDREN WERE VACCINATED. BUT WE DID CONSULT WITH A DOCTOR AND WE. WE EXTENDED THE TIMES OUT WE DIDN'T DO THE SECOND MMR UNDER HIS GUIDANCE. AND BUT I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT VACCINATIONS. IT'S ABOUT. THE FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS STATE TO BE A PARENT AND HAVE A CHOICE WHETHER THEY CHOOSE HOW TO RAISE OUR CHILD AND WHETHER THEY CAN GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL NOW YOU MAY SAY YES THEY CAN GO TO THIS BOARD AND THEY CAN JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS TO GET WHERE THEY WANT TO GO BUT IT'S A REALLY DETERRING FACTOR FOR A LOT OF THE CONSTITUENTS I REPRESENT WHO I SAW OVER THE WEEKEND YOU RE CONTEMPLATING LEAVING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- THEY DON'T LIKE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SO IT'S THEIR FAULT NAVIN YOU TO SOMEHOW GET THERE AND WE'RE ALWAYS AFTER THE BAD ACTOR BUT IN THE TIMES THAT WE GO AFTER THOSE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE. OR PEOPLE WHO ARE ABUSING THE RIGHT. WE CAPTURE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. THAT ARE TRYING TO BE. RESPONSIBLE PARENTS AND SAFEGUARD THEIR CHILDREN IN THROUGH THEIR CHOICES. TO ME THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT WE DID WE HAD SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHICH- WAS NARROWLY CRAFTED IN AND GAVE A EASIER OPPORTUNITY FOR PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THAT EXEMPTION. YOU KNOW IT'S A CHOICE OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL OR WHERE YOU'RE GONNA HOME WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO WITH YOUR CHILD AND THEY WANT TO GET EDUCATION THEY PAY TAXES LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I WANT TO ACCESS TO SYSTEMS. FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BUT THIS IS ABOUT PERSONAL. ADAMS AND THE RIGHT OF A PARENT THE BILL TO MAKE WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR THEIR CHILDREN SO I THINK THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR I KNOW THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS BUT THOSE EXEMPTIONS ARE TOUGH TO GET THROUGH. AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THAT'S THE GOAL IS THAT YOU MAKE IT SO HARD THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE LAY PERSON TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SO YOU END UP GETTING THE GOAL WHERE YOU'RE BASICALLY. COMING TO SOCIAL THREE TELLING EVERYBODY HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG. WE WERE HERE THAT WE'RE HERE TO. MAKE JUST LAWS WE'RE ALSO HERE TO KEEP PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FREEDOMS. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER WROTE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE THE REPUBLICAN LEADER WHEN THEY A SAND SO STRONG AGAINST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SPOKEN ON THIS FLOOR TODAY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION THE AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD SO KILEY TAKE A QUESTION. WHEN WE TO QUESTION FORCE I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES AS WITH LEGISLATORS RIGHT LEGISLATION THERE IS AN INTENT BEHIND THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO STOP COMPLETE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR FAMILIES THAT NEED OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN SO IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES ARE YOUR INTENT. WHAT WOULD IT BE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. YOU MAY RESPOND. SO I IF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION FIRST OF ALL I'D SAY THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE. AND PARTICULARLY CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY NEED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. BECAUSE IF THEY RECEIVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION MEANS THEY'RE NOT FULLY VACCINATED. AS OUT FULLY VACCINATED THEY ARE VULNERABLE. TO THOSE DISEASES SO WE DON'T HAVE A HIGH IN A VACCINATION RATE IN THE SCHOOL. FOUND THEM THEY ARE AT RISK OF ACTUALLY GETTING EXPOSED AND CATCHING THE DISEASE. NOW WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I'M GONNA DRESS ALSO THE AMENDMENTS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY SAY THAT THE VALUATION OF A MEDICAL EXEMPTION REQUEST IS BASED ON GUIDELINES INCLUDING THE STANDARD OF CARE CENTERS CARES WHAT ANY REASONABLE PHYSICIAN. WOULD FIND THAT'S REASONABLE TO GRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN FACT I WOULDPOINT OUT THAT BEGAN MY PRESENTATION OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WHEN THIS BILL LEFT THIS. FLOOR WE TOOK A MENACE THAT FIRST OF ALL SAID THAT NOT ONLY DOES GET REVIEWED BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH WAS IN THE BILL WHEN WE DEBATED HERE WE ACTUALLY CREATED A APPEALS. PANEL COMPOSED OF THREE PRACTICING PHYSICIANS. BUT THEY'RE NOT PLEASE OF THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THREE PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WHO BASICALLY WILL APPLY STANDARD OF CARE WHICH MEANS IF A REASONABLE POSITION WOULD GRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THEN THEY WILL PROVE THAT EXEMPTION. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A YEAH WE TALK ABOUT DOCTORS AND THIS IS A GROUP OF DOCTORS THAT BASICALLY ARE GOING TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SOMETHING REASONABLE POSITION WOULD DO THEN THE EXEMPTION WILL STAND. AND SO THAT IS THE STANDARD IN WHICHWE HAVE PLACED AND IN THIS BILL. AND SO I WOULD JUST. NOTE THAT AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO KEEP. PEOPLE SAFE. FOR KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL AND WE ARE GOING TO APPLY. A STANDARD OF CARE WHICH IS AGAIN WHAT A REASONABLE POSITION WOULD DO. AND I THINK THAT IF AN IF WE START TALKING ABOUT UNREASONABLE ACTS AND THERE I THINK ONE HAS TO ARGUE. THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED TO STEP IN BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT YOU DON'T THE PRIVILEGE. OF INJURING SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD. LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO INJURE SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THANK YOU. SO I APPRECIATE THAT ARE YOU JUST IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE BASICALLY. MY COLLEAGUES AND A LOT OF THE PARENTS THAT THAT OPPOSE THIS BILL I THINK THAT THERE IS NO MANNER OR MECHANISM IN TWO. AT MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THEY RECENTLY THERE WAS A SURVEY DONE OF EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CALIFORNIA PEDIATRICIANS WHO RECENTLY WERE SURVEY BY PHONE. THAT ASKED WHAT WOULD BE A STANDARD OF CARE MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND NONE OF THEM COULD COME UP WITH ONE SO AS A PHYSICIAN. IN YOU IS THE AUTHOR IN YOUR INTENT AND YOU WITH YOUR MEDICAL BACKGROUND I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS AS A PHYSICIAN IN YOUR OWN. THOUGHT AT YOUR INTENT WHAT WOULD BE A STANDARD OF CARE EXEMPTION FOR A FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO GET A MEDICAL SAYS. EXEMPTION FOR A MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD. WELL ACTUALLY THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR GETTING SENSE AND I'M NOT GOING YEAH I DON'T KNOW THAT I SPEND THE TIME HERE GOING THROUGH EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM YELLING IN THE CHAMBER YOU WILL BE REMOVED. DOCTOR PAN SO I APOLOGIZE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MATTER MISTER PRESIDENT. IF YOU YELL AGAIN AND DISRUPT THE HOUSE AND DISRUPT THE DECORUM OF THE HOUSE I WILL SIT DOWN AND NOT ANSWERED GET THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED THAT I THINK ARE VITAL THAT YOU GUYS NEED TO UNDERSTAND. SO PLEASE RESPECT THE DECORUM OF THE HOUSE SORRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD FIND OUT THAT WE STARTED WITH A SAID THE CDC. GUIDELINES AND WE ADDED THE AMERICAN JACQUI AS A GUIDELINE SO SAMPLES MENTIONED BY. MY GOOD FRIEND FROM MARCH COUNTY ANAPHYLAXIS RIGHT IF YOU OF YOUR CHILD'S HAD AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION OR IS ALLERGIC TO WE HAPPEN TO DOES ALLERGIC TO COMPONENT VACCINE. GALLAGHER NEW MEDICAL EXEMPTION IF YOU HAVE A SEIZURE AFTER YOUR D. TAP VACCINE AND WE CAN ADD THAT A FIVE THE CAUSE OF THE SEIZURE. RADIO COMPLEX EASIER THAT WOULD MARCH YOU A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IF YOU HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO OUR AND YOUR TOP PRIZE FOR THE MMR AND VARICELLA VACCINE DECK INTERVIEW MEDICAL EXEMPTION. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT AGAIN THAT YOUR- SAID AGAIN STANDARD OF CARE SO SOME PEOPLE SAID WELL IN ADVANCE OF A VERY RARE. CONDITION AND I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF IT'S WITHIN REASON. THE BOARD WILL SAY THAT YOU GET MEDICAL SENSE OF SAMPLES YOU ACTUALLY GOT CHICKEN POX BEFORE YOU GOT VACCINATED. YOU'LL GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOT THE DISEASE YOU DON'T IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAD THE DISEASE AND NOW YOU. THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO GET THE MUSICIAN FACT I MYSELF OF WRITTEN MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR THAT VERY REASON. AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BEING UNDER SCRUTINY BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH I WOULD POINT OUT. THIS REALLY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING TO REVIEW DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE ACTUAL REVIEW OF. VACCINATIONS AND THE NEED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IS THE VENUE IS THE CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HOUSE. AND SO AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES TO ENSURE WE CAN COME WITH MANY OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL. OF REASONS WHY SOMEONE WOULD I GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AGAIN THAT'S WE HAVE A THAT'S WHY WE CREE HAVE THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH. WHO DOES CONTAIN YOU KNOW DO HAVE EXPERTS THEIR PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN FACT WE TRUST THEM. TO FOLLOW PEOPLE WITH HIV WITH STDS. OTHER KINDS OF CONTENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE CALLED OUT TO HELP OUT. IN OUTBREAKS WHETHER IT'S HEPATITIS C. MEASLES. AND TYPHOID ANYTHING ELSE THEY ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THAT AND IF WE DON'T LIKE THEIR DECISION TO GO SO BOARD OF PRACTICING PHYSICIANS. WHO SAY IS THIS A REASONABLE THING TO DO. AND IF IT IS THEN THE EXEMPTION WILL BE APPROVED AND SO I THINK THAT. WE ACTUALLY CREATE A FAIRLY BROAD OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IF DANGER YOU I ONLY NEED ONE. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD WILL. ESSENTIALLY SAY THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION. THERE'S ANY QUESTION SOMEONE NEEDS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND THAT THE THERE'S A NICHE. THAT BASICALLY A RULE IN FAVOR OF THE FAMILY. RIGHT SB IF THAT IS SO YEAH LET'S BE BLUNT. IF SOMEONE SAYS WELL I WANT AMERICANS ACTION BECAUSE MY CHILD HAS AUTISM. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE. CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT THERE'S NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE TWO. HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE ANY IF THERE'S EVEN A QUESTION THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TWO. I THINK SIR THE AYE. I THINK THE INCLINATION WOULD BE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE WILL WE WANT TO OPERATE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE PARENT AND THE CHILD. THANK YOU I JUST. WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE WHOLE FAMILY HISTORY OR IF YOU HAVE HIS STORY YOU'RE- A SPECIAL DISEASE CDC CONTRADICTION IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER STANDARD OF CARE FOR MEDICAL HISTORY. SO I THINK EVEN USING MEDICAL HISTORY. AND IF THAT'S NOT TRUE I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL ME WHAT IS TRUE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY THE- I ASKED THE CDC AND HE SAID. THAT IS NOT COVERED THAT MEDICALLY STREETS NOT COVERED AS THE CDC CONTRADICTION. WHICH MAKES A LOT OF THE FAMILIES VERY VERY NERVOUS. THAT ARE IN THE BACK IN THE GALLERY AND WATCHING ONLINE BECAUSE- IF THEY HAVE A CHILD THAT HAD AN ADVERSE REACTION TO IT IS. TO A VACCINE ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO. THAT WE INJECT OUR CHILDREN WITH THEM. SO WHEN WE HAVE THOSE VACCINES INJECTED AND YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT HAS A MEDICAL HISTORY. AND IS MEDICALLY FRAGILE LIKE AUTO WHO CAME TO TESTIFY. AT THE HEARING THAT WE HAD IN HEALTH COMMITTEE. WHERE HE WAS AN AVERAGE EVERYDAY WONDERFUL TODDLER AND THEN AFTER A VACCINE. HAD ISSUES WITH THE SPINAL CORD HIS OCKLEY AT I A NERVES. AND NOW HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR SO. I MEAN I GUESS WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE ON HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN HIS PARENTS NOT TO. APPLY A VACCINE TO HIS SIBLINGS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE ADVERSE REACTION THAT HE HAD. SO THERE IS THAT. ANOTHER THING THAT KIND OF BOTHERS ME THAT I BROUGHT IT IN. CAN BE AS WELL AS IT THERE WAS A HOOPING COUGH OUT OUT BREAK. WESTLAKE SCHOOL I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL I APOLOGIZE. AND NOT ONE IT WAS. MET THE VACCINE RATE THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS BILL FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS IT MET THE VACCINE RATE OF 95% THE SCHOOL DID. AND THE ONES THAT GOT THE WHO PICKOFF. OUR KIDS WERE ACTUALLY. EXITED THE AN ACCIDENT CHILDREN DID NOT GET THE WHO BEEN COUGHING WHEN I. WOULD BE COVERED WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT. COMMITTEE YOUR EXACT RESPONSE WAS. THE VACCINE. WORKS THE WAY TO THE BACK AND IS SUPPOSED. BURKE. I DON'T AND- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AND I APOLOGIZE AND- AND AGAIN. I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S. SINCE YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR PARENTS THAT THEY FEEL. FROM THE DEPTHS OF THEIR SOUL THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S LIFE. AND THEIR EXISTENCE TO BE HAPPY HEALTHY KIDS AND ADULTS. I AM I WOULD EXPECT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BURST I WOULD NEVER CONDONE AND I CAME OUT WITH A PRESS RELEASE. ABOUT YOU BEING ATTACKED BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS NOT PART OF THIS GROUP. HE HE IS. HE IS SOMEONE WHO DISAGREES WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAD COUNTLESS PEOPLE REACH OUT TO ME. I POSTED THE PRESS RELEASE ON FACEBOOK. AND SEVERAL PEOPLE CAME OUT THAT OPPOSE THIS BILL. THAT DENOUNCED WITH THAT MAN DID TO YOU. SO IT'S NOT EVERYBODY THAT'S UP IN THE GALLAGHER WATCHING AGAIN THESE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING WHAT THEY BELIEVE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THEIR SOUL AS A PREVENTATIVE. DETRIMENTAL HARM TO THEIR CHILDREN AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND SO ON MY. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I. OFFICIATE ON THE DEBATE I'M ON WAS STRUCK BY THE REPEATED REFERENCE TO PERSONAL FREEDOMS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALL OF US THAT WE- NOT CHAU BOAT. BUT ON THE FLOOR ON THE RED CARPET THAT WE HAVE HONEST CONSISTENT CONVERSATION. BELIEVE IN TERMS OF RESPECTING EACH OTHER HAS RESPECT SHOULD BE HAS TO BE EARNED. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOMS. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. WHEN WE ARE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE TAKEN POWER AWAY FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BECAUSE WE KNOW BETTER ABOUT SENTENCING CRIMINALS AND SO WE'VE VOTED ON HUNDREDS OF SINCE ENHANCEMENTS. THE HELMET REQUIREMENT LAW SEAT BELT LAW. MINIMUM DRINKING AGE VOTING AGE. AND SO AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY WE DEBATE. PERSONAL FREEDOMS ON A REGULAR BASIS THIS IS NOT BRAND NEW AND WE SHOULD NOT ACTIVE SUCH. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY A COLLECTIVE ONE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT. THIS SERIES OF BILLS THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS IT EASY NOW. ARE THESE DEBATES IMPORTANT IS IT IMPORTANT FOR US TO FLESH OUT FACT FROM FICTIN YES ARE THESE EMOTIONAL ISSUES YES. ALL OF US ARE US WHO ARE PARENTS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AS A PARENT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ME THE SERVICE BUDGET YEAR AND FOCUS ON THE BUDGET FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE TWO A TO FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS CHILDREN. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY'S CHILD. EDUCATION FUNDING EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FUNDING PULLING AND LIFTING CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN NOT A DEEP POVERTY. THOSE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE ALL SHOULD GIVE EQUAL AN IMPORTANT FOCUS AND ATTENTION TO. EVERYBODY. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE PEDIATRICIAN DR PAN YOU CAN'T STAND HERE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EMPOWERED PHYSICIANS TO USE THEIR EDUCATION AND DISCRETION. AN OPINION BASED ON THE FACTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL CASE TO DETERMINE THAT I'M GLAD WE'VE EMPOWER THEM TO DO THAT AND I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO GIVE YOUR DEFINITION. KIND OF IN. GENERAL I WOULD WANT YOU TO LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL CASE AS A PEDIATRICIAN LOOK AT MY FAMILY HISTORY AND MAKE THE DECISION AND IF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SOME ODD POSITIONS DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD THAT POWER THAT CONCERNS ME AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT COMES AFTER THIS BILL IN MAKING SURE THAT THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE UNDERSTANDS LAW. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE EMPOWERED AND EXPECTED TO DO TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CHARGE. THAT'S THE NEXT PART APPARENTLY THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SOME ODD APPEAR TO BE CONFUSED IN THIS SURVEY. QUESTION OF THE OFFER MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER PRESIDENT. SENATE PANEL IS A QUESTION OF COURSE. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO WALK THROUGH FOR ME ONE MORE TIME SIR I THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION OF YOU THE TIMES I'VE HEARD IN COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR BEFORE I CAST MY VOTE TODAY ON THE FLOOR. IN MY EFFORT TO REPRESENT THE CONSTITUENCY AYE SIR. AND TO DO MY DUE DILIGENCE AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ALL RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WALK ME THROUGH HOW AN EXEMPTION CAN BE. RECEIVED IF YOU WILL WHAT IS THAT STEP BY STEP PROCESS BECAUSE I HEAR. MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT IT'S AN ARDUOUS PROCESS I WHEN HERE FOR MYSELF WHAT THE STEPS ARE IF YOU WILL. THANK YOU BASICALLY NOR DO YOU GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THE UNDER THIS BILL PHYSICIAN. I WOULD INTENT OF MAY HAVE IDENTIFIED IN ADDITION TO TAKING CARE OF THAT THE. SHOULD NOT BE IMMUNIZED FOR THAT THE PARTICULAR CONDITION AND THEREFORE SAY WELL SINCE YOU'RE ENTERING SCHOOL. WE NEED TO GIVE YOU A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO YOU CAN CONTINUE ENTERED SCHOOL THAN THEY WOULD FILE A- FORM WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THEY WOULD SELL BASICALLY SAYING WHO THE PATIENT IS. CERTIFYING THAT DEALT WITH THEIR ON THEIR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR OR I CAN INFORM YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR DONE. FILING AN EXEMPTION FOR THEM AND THE REASON FOR THE EXEMPTION. AND THEN AT THAT POINT THAT WOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THAT WOULD BE REVIEWED BY THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS A NURSES AND DOCTORS IN FACT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. IT'S APPROVED BRIAN NURSE WILL SAY IT'S APPROVED AND WE'RE DONE IT IT'S IF THE PART OF THE CELTS AS WELL. WE'RE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. I'M SURE WILL BE REVIEWED BY A PHYSICIAN AND THEN AT THAT POINT IN TIME IF THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS THAT. THE AGREED DATE THEN EXEMPTION IS YOU HAVE THE EXEMPTION. A BY THE WAY I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WHILE IT'S GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS YOUR CHILD HAS THAT MEDICAL ATTENTION ENGINE CONTINUE ATTENDING SCHOOL. OKAY SO SOON YOU THIS IS YOUR TURN IT AND BY THE FALL YOU GET THE MEDICAL SECTION. THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT IS REJECTED. THEN YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED. AND THEN YOU CAN SAY WELL ACTUALLY I DISAGREE. THIS FINDING. AND THEN YOU CAN APPEAL TO THE PANEL AS  MENTIONED THAT WAS TAKEN UP IN THE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN THAT PANEL WILL THEN ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THE FAMILY AND THE PHYSICIAN COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FAT INFORMATION TO THE PANEL. AND THEN THEY WERE REVIEW. AND IF THEY REVIEW THEY SAY THAT SOMETHING VISIBLE PHYSICIAN WOULD DO THEN THEY WILL APPROVE IT. AND YOU'RE SET. IF THEY ALSO DECLINE THEN WHICH THAT CASE AFTER THAT POINT. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THIRTY DAYS. AND WHICH YOUR CHILD CAN STILL ATTEND SCHOOL. WITH MEDICAL EXEMPTION BUT THEN AT THAT POINT TIME EITHER WILL. DECIDE TO GET YOUR CHILD VACCINATED OR YOU CAN CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOL TAKE AN INDEPENDENT STUDY OF PUBLIC FUNDS PUBLICLY FUNDED EDUCATION. OR YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HOME SCHOOL THOSE OF THE OPTIONS AT NO POINT TIME WOULD YOU BE REQUIRED. TO MANDATED TO VACCINATE YOUR CHILD AGAINST HER WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION. I THINK SOONER CENTER MONEY. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE AGREED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW WE ENGAGE IN CIVIL DISCOURSE HOW WE ENGAGE IN TOUGH LEGISLATION I APPRECIATE THOSE WHO HAVE LED WITH THAT RECOGNITION I ALSO APPRECIATE THOSE HERE WHO ABIDE BY THAT SAME COMMITMENT TO CIVIL DISCOURSE. IN YOUR HERE. BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY FEEL TO BE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE ON THE FLOOR TODAY. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT PREVENT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US TODAY DO NOT PRE VENT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND I DO WANT TO ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE NOTION BY SOME WHO OPPOSE THIS THAT WERE INTERFERING WITH PERSONAL FREEDOM. PERSONAL FREEDOM IS NOT ABSOLUTE. WE AS A LEGISLATURE SAY YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH A RED LIGHT BECAUSE IT ENDANGERS PUBLIC SAFETY WE SAY% YOU CAN'T EXCEED THE SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE IT ENDANGERS PUBLIC SAFETY. I HAVE CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT. HAVE SAID THEIR PERSONAL FREEDOM HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHILD WITH AN AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE OR IN IN THE PROCESS OF RECEIVING CANCER TREATMENTS WERE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN. ADVERSELY IMPACTED THEY CAN'T SEND THEIR CHILD TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT THEIR TAXES ARE SUPPORTING BECAUSE THE IMMUNE RATE THE VACCINIA VACCINATION RATE AT THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL HAS DROPPED IN SOME CASES THE 70% OR BELOW SO THEIR PERSONAL FREEDOM THAT I WAS ALSO ELECTED TO PROTECT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT I WAS SELECTED TO PROTECT WE'RE TELLING THEM YOU'RE PAYING TAXES TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE OF THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL BELIEF. NOT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. THAT CONSTITUENT IS HAVING THEIR PERSONAL BELIEFS AND THEIR RIGHT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR CHILD TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S BEING ABRIDGED THIS BILL SEEKS TO FIND THAT BALANCE I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE CRAFTING THESE AMENDMENTS. AND IT'S ARTICULATED BY THE AUTHOR. PROVIDE A PATH. WHERE A FAMILY IN THEIR PHYSICIAN CAN DISCUSS WHETHER THEIR CHILD SHOULD BE AFFORDED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND AS SOON AS THAT DR GRANT SAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. IT. IT ENGAGES A FURTHER PROCESS WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT CHILD IMMEDIATELY HAS THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THERE'S CHECKS AND BALANCES THEY INDEED PROTECT. PERSONAL RIGHTS OF ALL CONSTITUENTS OF ALL STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL BELIEF PROTECTIONS COLLEAGUES. THEY ARE NOT ABSOLUTE IF THE EXERCISE OF YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS. THE BRIDGE IS THE RIGHT OF MY CHILD TO GO TO A CLASSROOM THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE USE OF SCIENCE. ANY USE OF IMMUNIZATIONS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US ON CONCURRENCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT WHEN IT WHEN THIS BILL FIRST GAME BUT BEFORE THE FLOOR ON ITS INITIAL PASS. I ROSE IN SUPPORT BUT WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUE THURMOND DISCUSSION FOR HERE TODAY AROUND FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY SPECIALLY COVERAGE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND WHETHER THE CDC GUIDELINES WERE EXPANSIVE ENOUGH. FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE DESPITE THE. VIOLENT RHETORIC AND THREATS YOU FACE. AS AN AUTHOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO REACH AND STRETCH A BIT THROUGH THE AMENDMENT PROCESS I APPRECIATE ALSO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. AND EVERYONE WHO HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. SETTING SOME STANDARD DECORUM HERE EVEN THE ADVOCATES WHOSE SO VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE IT. WE CAN'T ACCEPT VIOLENCE AS OUR. AS OUR CURRENCY IN OUR POLITICS WERE ABOVE THAT. BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE COUNTLESS CONSTITUENTS WHO VISITED IN MY OFFICE AND SAT WITH ME FOR MANY HOURS IT EDUCATING ME ABOUT. THEIR CONCERNS THEIR HOPES THEIR FEARS INTRODUCING ME TO THEIR KIDS. A LOT OF VERY STRONG MOMS IN PARTICULAR. BEHIND THIS EFFORT AND IT'S BEEN MOVING. BECAUSE OF SOME THAT EDUCATION I STILL DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL BE ENGAGING ON THIS EFFORT TO MAKE SOME TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS THAT I THINK WILL MAKE THIS BILL WORKABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT NO CALIFORNIAN IS FORCED TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD IF IT'S GOING TO CAUSE THAT CHILD HARM. PERIOD THAT SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT FORCES UPON A PERSON HERE. AND I BELIEVE THAT IS YOUR INTENT DR. I HAVE SOME. SOME OF THOSE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT. STILL pBE ADDRESSED AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE TRIGGER OF FIVE EXEMPTIONS PER YEAR FOR ONE DOCTORED TO CALL THAT EXCESSIVE. FEELS A LITTLE ARBITRARY FOR ME. BUT I THINK THERE'S ROOM TO WORK ON THAT. THE 95% IMMUNITY RATE THAT TRIGGERS THAT A THAT REVIEW I'M I KNOW THERE ARE SOME SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES TO WORK OUT THERE. AND I KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE STANDARD OF CARE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A MEANINGFUL ENHANCEMENT OF WHAT WE HAD PRIOR BUT THERE IS STILL. DISCRETION THAN THAT NOW CITY PH WON'T HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO MAKE IT UP OR DOWN VOTE. ON A FAMILIES VERY PERSONAL DECISION. THAT THEY WILL. HAVE NOW THE CONSULTATION OF DOCTORS. AND ABIDING BY SOME STANDARD CARE THAT. EXCEEDS THE SORT OF OBJECTIVE AND RIGID STANDARDS SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY BUT WITH THE HOPES THAT IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT. WE CAN HALF THAT WE'VE GOT HERE THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN REALLY REALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE ASSURANCES THAT WERE MAKING A PARENTS AROUND THE STATE. WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE. CONCERNS AND WELL FOUNDED FEAR WHEN THINGS COME IN SACRAMENTO THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S NOT TO GET BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR ARE YOU AND YOUR CHILD IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY ARE SAFE. WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SERIOUS MEDICAL ISSUES. BUT THAT A PREFERENCE IS NOT ENOUGH. THAT A PERSONAL BELIEF. IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME MEDICAL BASIS. SO I'M HOPING WE CAN FIND THAT THAT LANDING SPOT I KNOW THIS IS BEEN HARD. BUT MOST OF ALL I JUST I APPRECIATE WITH THESE BODIES DONE TODAY IN THE DEBATE. AND CHECKING OURSELVES IN MAKING SURE THIS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FEEL SAFE TO MAKE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I INITIALLY DIDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I WANTED TO INSURE THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF A TEAM TASK FORCE. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW APPEALS. I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT I WISH TO EXPRESS ONE LAST CONCERNED THAT I DO THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE PART THE AMENDMENT WITH REGARD TO ADD A PHYSICIAN AND THAT HAS FIVE OR MORE EXEMPTIONS. MY FEAR IS THAT. THIS MIGHT CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I'M A PHYSICIAN WOULD BE HAS A TENT. TO GRANT AN EXEMPTION AND I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. MY COUSIN IN ARIZONA IS A PHYSICIAN WHO IS AN EXPERT. ON VALLEY FEVER AND HE IS ONE OF THE FEW IN THE NATION WHO HAS STUDIED VALLEY FEVER FOR DECADES IT HAS BEEN HIS LIFE'S WORK. I BELIEVE THEY'RE PROBABLY PHYSICIANS OUT THERE WHO ARE. MUCH MORE EXPERT IN THIS AREA THAN OTHERS ARE AND I WOULD THINK THAT IF I WAS OF A FAMILY APPARENT TO HAD A CHILD THAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT. THAT I WOULD SEEK OUT AN EXPERT. WHO HAS MORE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS FIELD THEN AN AVERAGE DOCTOR. AND I THINK THAT THAT PARENTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THOSE EXPERTS AND I THINK THAT THOSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE A. B. SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO. DELVE INTO THIS ARENA AND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE FAMILIES. SO THAT MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS ARE MADE AND SO THAT WE DO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THOSE SITUATIONS THOSE MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS THAT DEALING WILL EXIST AND I ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT WITH THIS LEGISLATION. AND THAT WE WILL NEED TO RELY ON THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE OF THOSE PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO GRANT MORE THAN FIVE EXEMPTIONS AND WE SHOULD. MEET THEM WITH THAT SPIRIT SO I WOULD ASK THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. I JUST WANTED THE WHOLE HEARTEDLY ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE IN THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS THE CENTERS FROM WITH THE HOUSE AND FROM STOCKTON. JEAN ALL DEBATE HAVING TO SEIZE. DOCTOR PAN AND YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AS AS ONE THANK EVERYONE FOR THE FOR THE DISCUSSION I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE AND FOR THE EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT. AROUND OUR CIVIC DIALOGUE. AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW NOTES BASED ON SOME THE COMMON PEOPLE MADE ON THE BILL AND PARTICULARLY THE AMENDMENTS SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD MAKE NOTES AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES FOR ASK ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTION I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT ALSO THAT PROCESS ONLY ACTUALLY CHECKS IN. IF THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL UNDER 95% OR THE PHYSICIAN HAS WRITTEN MORE THAN FIVE EXEMPTION SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IRONTON PLAY THEY WERE TO TURN EXEMPTION AND EXEMPTION WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND THAT WOULD BASICALLY BE THOUSAND SO IFYOU'RE ATTENDING A SCHOOL WHERE THE NIGHT YOU HAVE A 95% OR ABOVE WHICH MEANS WE HAVE. TO MEDIUM UNITY WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY NOT A PROBLEM RIGHT SO WHAT BUT IT WON'T BE ME GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE REVIEW. PROCESS THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND I APPRECIATE. BUT ALSO I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES ARE THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF REVIEW. OKAY AND IN FACT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN TERMS OF SPECIALISTS THE ONCOLOGISTS TO ACTUALLY WOULD BE IN A POSITION PERHAPS RIGHT MORE THAN FIVE THE ALLERGIST IMMUNOLOGIST TO TAKE CARE OF SOME WITHOUT IMMUNE DISEASE THEY SUPPORT THE BILL. THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCRUTINY. THEY WELCOME IT. BECAUSE IT'S THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE ENDANGERED WHEN SOMEONE ELSE WRITES AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT'S WHY THEY'RE FINE WITH IT. NOW WE WANT TO REVIEW MY EXEMPTIONS I'M GOOD WITH THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND. I WOULD ALSO WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE MEDICAL BOARD. THE MEDICAL BOARD WHAT'S THIS BILL THEY HAVE VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS TO GO AFTER IS PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE SAY THE BAD DOCTORS OF THE DOCTORS ARE ABUSING THEIR- AUTHORITY AND SO THE MEDICAL BOARD WANTS US TO PASS THIS BILL SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACT AND DO THEIR JOB. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE OF THAT YOU KNOW. WE ALL WANT FREEDOM WE WANT TO FEED ON THE ABOUT BE ABLE TO GO ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE SAFE NOT WORRY ABOUT HAVING TO CATCH A DANGEROUS DISEASE OURSELVES. OUR CHILDREN ARE BABIES. WE ALL WANT THE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND NO THEY'LL BE SAFE AND SO THIS BILL AGAIN IS ABOUT BEING SURE THAT THE CHILDREN WHO REALLY NEED THE MEDICAL SENTIENCE AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE VACCINATED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IF THEY HAVE THE PROTECTION OF THE OTHERS IN THE SCHOOL. AND SO I THINK WE TALK ABOUT FREEDOM WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF ALL FAMILIES AND ALL CHILDREN SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR OFFICE AND I THINK THE ASSEMBLY FOR WORKING TO. CRAFT THE AMENDMENTS THAT MAKES IT MORE TARGETED. THAT ADDRESSES MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT. I AM AGAIN AS I MENTIONED IN MY- OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW. WILLING TO OF COURSE WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS TO BE SURE YEAH WE DO IMPLEMENTATION. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE CHILDREN DON'T THERE'S QUESTIONS FROM THE EXPERTS RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE PANEL DOING STANDARD OF CARE THAT THAT GIVES THAT FLEXIBILITY. TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS UNUSUAL SITUATION WE DON'T. WITH THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AND IN THAT UNCERTAINTY WE WANT THE- CHILD IN THE FAMILY. TO BE THE ONES THAT WE ROOM FAVOR US. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL INTENTIONALLY CREATED THAT FLEXIBILITY WITH THE APPEALS PANEL AND THAT AND THE FLEXIBILITY THERE. SO WITH THAT AGAIN WHY THANK EVERYONE FOR THE DISCUSSION. AND I SUSPECT WE ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE CONCURRENCE WITH ASSEMBLY AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN.

JENNER GONZALEZ MOVES A CALL NEXT UP IS ITEM ONE FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR GONZALEZ ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THIS ITEM YES MISS SECTOR PLEASE ROUTE ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC WORKS. THIRD FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB FIVE TWENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA WHICH DEFINES WHEN A PUBLIC SAYS SUBSIDY IS TO MINIMUS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING. IF THE PREVAILING WAGE APPLIES PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE TERM DE MINIMUS IS NOT DEFINED AND STATUES TO THERE'S NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY OR REGULATORS AS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE MINISTER. AND THIS IS LED TO MANY ISSUES OF LITIGATION. THIS BILL SPECIFIES THAT A PUBLIC SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST RECENT AMENDMENTS EXAMPLE CONSTRUCTION OF SINGLE FAMILY UNITS FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THRESHOLD AND AS A REMINDER OUR STATE'S PREVAILING WAGE LAWS. ALREADY EXEMPTS ANY CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR LOW OR MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT EXEMPTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW AND MEN SKEWS ME IT AND MAINTAINED UNDER THIS BILL NO DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO TAKE A PUBLIC SUBSIDY OVER THE DE MINIMUS AMOUNT IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. IN CLOSING AB FIVE TWENTY WILL CLARIFY THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHEN PREVAILING WAGES APPLIED. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF ITS MOUTH. WE KNOW WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE. EXPAND THE COVERAGE OF THE PREVAILING WAGE I'M PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS RECEIVING MINIMAL MINIMAL PUBLIC SUBSIDIES BY LOWERING THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT WILL TRIGGER THE LAWS APPLICATION AS A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT SPECIFICALLY THE AMOUNT OF THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY TRIGGERING. THE COVERAGE REQUIRED WOULD BE GENERALLY LOWER THAN BOTH LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LESS THAN 2% OF THE PROJECT'S COST THE BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT A PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR A PROJECT. CONSISTENCY CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING UNITS IS DE MINIMUS IF LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL POTTER PRODUCTS COST. AB FIVE TWENTY CODIFIES IT FOR PROJECT RECEIVED A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IN THE AREA OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IS LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST EMPLOYERS. WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE. WHICH OF COURSE IS GOING TO PASS ON TO THE CONSUMER IN HIGHER HOUSING COSTS. THIS IS AN ILL CONCEIVED POWER GRAB BY LABOR UNIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF. ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA HAS A HOMELESS PROBLEM AND A HOUSING CRISIS ADDING MORE COSTS ON TO THE ALREADY HIGH COSTS AND FEES MANDATED ON DEVELOPMENT. AND CONSTRUCTION WILL ONLY MAKE OUR CRISIS WORSE. FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU INCREASE THE PRICE OF A HOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BUY THAT HOME. EXTRAPOLATING AT THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A FIGURE GOES UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THAT WILL NOW NOT BE ABLE TO FURTHER. AFFORD A HOME IN THE GOLDEN STATE. PASSAGE OF AB FIVE TWENTY WILL MEAN A DEAD AND TO THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INSTEAD OF FINDING A HOME. HOW MANY WILL END UP ON THE STREETS EXACERBATING. ONE OF THE LARGEST HUMANITARIAN CRISES. THE NOT ONLY OUR STATE IS WITNESSED BUT OUR COUNTRY IS IN DURING. AB FIVE TWENTY NOT ONLY ONE PACK ACOSTA BUILD HOMES BUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF APARTMENTS PLAYGROUNDS PARKS AND SCHOOLS. STATE OFFICE BUILDINGS COMMUNITY CLINICS PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND- AND SO MUCH MORE. AB FIVE TWENTY WILL DELIVER A SEVERE BLOW TO THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE CONTRACTORS STRUGGLING TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN EMPLOY. MANY OF THE SMALLER BUSINESSES ARE MINORITY OWNED. IF YOU CARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS IF YOU WANT TO GROW JOBS AND HELP SOLVE OUR HOUSING CRISIS THE VOTE TO MAKE IT EASIER AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING DON'T MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE. YOUR VOTE TODAY IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU SUPPORT THE UNIONS IN THIS STATE OR WHETHER YOU SUPPORT THE CONSTITUENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP YOUR BILL WILL BE RATHER TRANSPARENT AND VERY CLEAR. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY. SENATOR LEYVA. OKAY I DIDN'T WRITE I DIDN'T BREAK IT UP THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TO MAKE YOU A KNOWS THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT UNIONS ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS SUPPORT UNIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE MAKE A LIVING WAGE THEY CAN BUY A HOUSE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES BUT BACK TO THIS BILL ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO ONE THING AND IS GOING TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE BECAUSE THIS LOOPHOLE HAS ALLOWED DEVELOPERS. WHO HAVE RECEIVE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES THAT'S MONEY THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT THERE FOR THEM RANGING FROM SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH EQUATES TO POINT 5% OR ONE POINT 75% OF THE TOTAL COST OF A PARTICULAR PROJECT AND THEY ARE NOT THEN REQUIRED TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE SO ALL THIS DOES IS CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE SO THAT EVERYONE HAS TO ABIDE BY THE LAW I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE- FOR MANAGER FOR ME. THE QUESTION. OKAY SO WHERE I QUESTION IS ARE WE HEAR THAT IS ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THIS IS GOING TO WASH DEVELOPMENT OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THIS BILL OF FOUR APPLY TO THE BUILDING OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DOES NOT IT'S EXEMPTED VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORAL. ALL YOU DOWN OKAY SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT JUST TO POSE A QUESTION TO THE FLOOR MANAGER. CENTER GONZALEZ WITH HER QUESTION. THANK YOU IN REVIEWING THIS PROPOSED PEACE LEGISLATION I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU MIGHT OFFER WHAT IS THE RATIONALE OR THE COMPELLING NEED FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WELL WE'VESEEN THAT WITH MAJOR DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING IN AND MANY OF OUR CITIES WE KNOW THAT WHEN PUBLIC SUBSIDIES TAX DOLLAR PAID TAX UP HERE DOLLARS ARE. UP PROVIDED UPWARDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE DON'T GET ANY COMMUNITY BENEFITS NOR DO WE HAVE LOCAL HIGHER OR ANY TYPE OF PROVISIONS TO REALLY SAFEGUARD GOOD. WAGES ON THESE JOBS SO THIS IS WHY WE'RE BRINGING THIS FOR TODAY TO CAP THAT WHAT IS THE CURRENT THRESHOLD THAT WOULD TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE THERE IS NO CURRENT WELL. THERE'S A TWO PERCENT BUT THERE IS NO CAP ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT. ALRIGHT SO. IN A TOTALLY WERE HEARING THAT. THERE'S MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING THAT IS NOT TO THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY WORK TO. THE TAXPAYERS THAT'S CORRECT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF A DEVELOPER DOES NOT WANT TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE YOU NEED NOT APPLY FOR PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. ONE FINAL QUESTION SO IF DOLLARS ARE CONTRIBUTED FROM A PUBLIC ENTITY THROUGH A PASS THROUGH ORGANIZATION LIKE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION IS THAT ALSO DOES THAT. STATUS OF MONEY STILL REMAIN IF THE IF THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENTITY CONTRIBUTES TO A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROJECT OR SOME OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ONLY A STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD. BUT EVERY UNIQUE EVERY SITUATION IS UNIQUE BUT IT WOULD MOSTLY BE A STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD QUALIFY. SO IT'S ONLY A STATE AGENCY RIGHT I MEAN AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION COULD BE YOU KNOW A BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT IT COULD BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE STATE AGENCIES SO. UNLESS THERE'S ANY STATE FUNDING. OR STATE AGENCY RELATED TO THIS THAT WOULD NOT APPLY IT FORGIVE ME FOR BELIEVER IN THIS AS ONE MAKE CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND CIVIC CENTER TO BORDERS YOU HAVE DEBATE TO OFFER. WONDERSTRUCK UNDERSTAND IF THE STATE OF IF STATE DOLLARS FIND THEIR WAY INTO MUNICIPALITY MUNICIPALITY FINDS ITS WAY TO ANOTHER RELATED ENTITY WHICH THEN FINDS WAY TOWARD PROJECT. IS THE COLOR OF THAT MONEY STILL. CONTINUE WITH THE FLOW OF THAT MONEY AND. HE CONSIDERED A PUBLIC A PUBLIC INVESTMENT. THE NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAUGHTER SAID IN YOUR CALL. I WAS INTERESTED IN THE LOS AGENCYOR STATE DOLLARS BEING USED AND YES IT WOULD BUT IT JUST DEPENDS. AND HOW AND WHAT FORMAT I MEAN THERE'S VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND NOT ONLY DO I SUPPORT PREVAILING WAGE I'VE ALSO SUPPORTED LOCAL HIGHER PROVISIONS THAT MIGHT LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT WE EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THE WORK THEN ARE ALSO PAID A SALARY OR WAGE WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BUY ONE OF THE HOMES OR RESIDENCES APARTMENTS OR RENT FROM THOSE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE BUILDING THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING A LIVABLE WAGE A PREVAILING WAGE IS A POSITIVE THING IT ENSURES THAT WORKERS ARE ABLE TO LIVE AND THRIVE IN A COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE ECONOMICALLY TO THAT COMMUNITY AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL YES I THINK IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE IN PREVENTING WAGE OR NOT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO FOR ME FOR MAY MY CONSTITUENTS WANT TO SEE ME VOTE FOR LIVABLE WAGE FOR PEOPLE PREVAILING WAGE AND GET FAIR PAY FOR THEIR WORK IF. SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH THEIR HAND OUT AND ASKED FOR SOME KIND OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY THIS IS IMPORTANT JOB PRINCIPLE THAT I BELIEVE IN. AND ALWAYS HAVE OUR CHEN AYE VOTE. SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WE HAVE A SERIOUS HOMELESS PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PART OF THAT IS THE BIG MAJORITY OF THAT IS A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY 53% OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE HERE IF YOU TAKE THAT TO THE MILLENNIAL AGE 63% OF THEM BELIEVE THEY CAN OF NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE HERE HOUSING COSTS HAVE GONE UP DRASTICALLY IT'S ALMOST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR A ONE BED A MONTH FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S VERY AND AFFORDABLE TO LIVE IN THIS STATE AND TO ADD ADDITIONAL COST ON TO THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION I GET THAT SOMEBODY MAKING A LIVING WAGE PREVAILING WAGE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE HOUSES BUT THOSE PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING IN HOMES THAT THEY OWN AND SO THE NEW HOUSING THAT WE BILL TO BE BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WITHOUT OR WITHOUT A HOUSE NOW. WHEN YOU I COME IN ON TWELFTH STREET WHEN I CAME IN FOR MY HOME THAT I'M OUT OF HERE AND I SEE THE HOMELESS CAMPS AND ONE DAY I WALKED THROUGH THERE AND I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU GUYS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN THAT CAMP THAT WERE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THOSE CAMPS THEY FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOOSE TO LIVE THAT WAY BUT THERE IS A TREND THAT LOST HIS WIFE AND HE QUIT WORKING HE LOST HIS HOME. THERE IS A THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR JOB THAT LIVES THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BUY A HOME THAT CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOME BECAUSE THEY MAKE AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND HOUSING IS WAY OF FOR UNAFFORDABLE SO THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ADD ADDITIONAL COST ON THE PRICE OF BUILDING A HOME IS THIS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS COMPARED TO. WHAT'S GOING ON OUR STATE WITH FORCIBLY CRISIS. THAT WE HAVE NOW. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ANY OF IT. YOU SEE NO FOR DISCUSSION SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISS RATHER TOM I DO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE LOST IN THE DEBATE IS WHAT WILL OUR HOME IS A HOME SINGLE FAMILY CERTAINLY BUT MULTI FAMILY IS LAW NOT EXEMPTED FROM THIS THE WAY I READ THE BILL AND CURRENTLY THE COST PER SQUARE FOOT OF MULTI FAMILY IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. TO BULD A MULTI FAMILY THAT WOULD CERTAINLY WITH PREVAILING WAGE BEING REQUIRED ON THAT THAT COSTS WILL GO UP IN CERTAINLY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THOSE FORMS THEY ARE GOING TO BE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET EVEN IF WE GIVE THEM A LIVING WAGE A LIVING WAGE HOUSE TO INCREASE. EXPONENTIALLY TO MEET THE COSTS THIS BEING PUT ON THE BUILDING OF A HOME AND I CONSIDER MULTI FAMILY THE MOST IMPORTANT HOMES THAT WE CAN BUILD THESE DAYS THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE GET THEIR STARTER TO GET INTO PRIVATE HOMEOWNERSHIP SO I WOULD LIKE US TO RETHINK THIS ARE A FOR GOING TO BE EXEMPTION CERTAINLY MULTI FAMILY OUGHT TO BE PART OF THAT. BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY WHAT'S. NEEDED IN OUR STATE SO I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU. SEEN NO FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF BAIT SENATOR GONZALEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I JUST WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE. THIS DOES INCLUDE ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES SUCH AS FOR CLARIFICATION. SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS ARE PRIVATE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEYSO IS GETTING THAT IN MY HEAD BUT- LASTLY AGAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR SINGLE FAMILY EXEMPTIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR LOW AND MODERATE. THE PER UNIT COST HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIATED SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE AND WE DON'T. WE CAN'T QUANTIFY WHETHER HAS ACTUALLY WILL INCREASE OUR COSTS AND IN FACT WE DON'T THINK IT WILL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY BENEFITS THAT. DEVELOPERS ALREADY RECEIVED AND AGAIN IF THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN RECEIVING OR SORRY FOR PAYING A PREVAILING WAGE THAN THEY NEED NOT APPLY FOR. PUBLIC SUBSIDIES.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I RISE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETY NINE WRITTEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW IN OTHER LGBT Q. ADVOCATES AS WELL AS EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN LEADERS THIS MEASURE CONCERNS CONVERSION THERAPY CONVERSION THERAPY IS A DISCREDITED IN IN HEART AND A HARMFUL. BOTH METHOD IN THEORY. OF TRYING TO CONVERT ONE'S GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. IT'S BEEN DISCREDITED BY NUMBER OF BOTH PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS. EACH OF US COMES TO THIS CHAMBER EACH OF US COMES THE LEGISLATURE WITH THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WE CAN'T DIVORCE OURSELVES FROM THOSE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW ANECDOTAL THEY MAY BE AND SO I BRING MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I BRING THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF MY FAMILY. AND WHAT CONVERSION THERAPY DID TO ONE OF MY- RELATIVES MY BROTHER IN LAW THE HARM CAUSED HIM MY LATE BROTHER IN LAW IN THE HARM THAT IT CAUSED OUR FAMILY. BY TRYING TO SHAME HIM BY TRYING TO CREATE SOME SORT OF BEHAVIORAL MECHANISM. TO CHANGE HIS SEXUAL ORIENTATION. IT CREATED TREMENDOUS DEPRESSION. DEBILITATION AND DISCORD IN THE FAMILY. THIS RESOLUTION IS A SIMPLE RESOLUTION IT DOESN'T DICTATE THAT ANYBODY DO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE HARM. IT CAN BE CAUSED BY CONVERSION THERAPY IT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS THE CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THIS. DOES IN REAL TIME TO NOT JUST MEMBERS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BUT TO ALL OF US HIRED AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SENATOR. THIS. THIS MATTER AND THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT ON THIS MATTER CAME BEFORE JUDICIARY AND IT WAS A VERY IS A VERY INTERESTING DEBATE. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CONVERSION THERAPY. ON THE AND I DO HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND THEY HAVE VERY STRONG MANY OF THEM HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. AND I'M GOING TO TAKE THEIR WORD ON THAT IT IS NOT BEEN HELPFUL BUT I WILL JUST SIMPLY ADD A WORD OF CAUTION. THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS JUST A RESOLUTION IS NOT A SUBSTANTIVE ON PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT WE ARE TREADING INTO FREEDOM OF SPEECH TERRITORY THAT I THINK SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US. AND WHEN I SAY FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION THESE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED AREAS OF OUR OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT NGUYEN IN INDIVIDUAL SEEKS THERAPY OR GUIDANCE ON BEFORE A RELIGIOUS LEADER OR A MEMBER OF A CONGREGATION WHETHER IT BE A MOSQUE A TEMPLE OR CHURCH. THAT THAT IS IN A PRIVATE SETTING IN THAT IT IS ALSO VOLUNTEER. AND LASTLY THE MEMBERSHIP IN THAT ON THAT CONGREGATION IS NOT CONDITIONS ON THE SEEKING FOR A POSITION OF THAT TREATMENT SO I THINK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ITS VOLUNTARY NATURE IT'S CONFIDENTIAL NATURE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMIND OURSELVES THAT. WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FREEDOM OF RELIGION. AND TO DISALLOW OR CREATE THE PATHWAY WHERE WE TELL INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY CANNOT SAY CERTAIN THINGS. SHOULD GIVE US PAUSE AND THAT'S ONLY REASON WHY WE HAD SUCH I THINK STRENUOUS DEBATE IN JUDICIARY ON THIS WAS PRIMARILY ON FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS. CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE AS CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS HI THIS RESOLUTION AS A PRIORITY FOR OUR CAUCUS AND YOU HAVE TO JUST TO BE VERY FRANK CONVERSION THERAPY A PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE IT IS IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO LEGITIMACY THERE'S NO SUPPORT FOR THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE CAN CHANGE THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THERE'VE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE ON WHO HAD BEEN. BADLY DAMAGED BY THESE EFFORTS WHICH IS WHY WE BANDS CONVERSION THERAPY FOR CHILDREN BUT EVEN FOR ADULTS IT IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING WE SHOULD NOT BE CONDONING IT WE SHOULD BE OPPOSING AT AND I WILL KNOW THAT YET AGAIN RECENTLY YET ANOTHER LEADER IN THE CONVERSION THERAPY MOVEMENT. ACKNOWLEDGE A GUESS WHY HE'S A GAY MAN. AND WE SEE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. LGBT PEOPLE WHO WHO STAR ADVOCATING FOR CONVERSION THERAPY AND THEN IN THE YEAH AND A KNOWLEDGE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK AND THEY'RE STILL LGBT. THIS IS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE WE NEED TO REJECT THIS TERRIBLE THING. CENTER JACKSON. IT'S THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY DO WANT TO RESPOND TO THIS FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM IT'S A VERY INTERESTING ONE AND FRANKLY UNTIL RECENTLY THE INTERPRETATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS A ONE RELIGION COULD NOT IMPOSE ITSELF ON OTHER RELIGIONS. ARE SO IT TOO WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE RULE THAT ONE SHOULD HAVE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHERS IS A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT AND HOPEFULLY ONE THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE REJECTED. I IT IS ESSENTIALLY A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT ONE RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERMINE THE PROTECTIONS IN THE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO OTHERS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD DURING OUR- HEARING AND TO. THE NOTION THAT. BY TRYING TO PROTECT MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY FROM OF THE HORRORS OF THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IS NOT. A GRANT THING IT OR DO YOU SHOULD NOT BE I HATE TO USE WERE TRUMP BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE OF A BY THOSE WHOSE RELIGION SAYS THAT. THAT THOSE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE LGBT Q. COMMUNITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE GRANTED THEM BECAUSE ONE. OTHER ANOTHER PERSON'S RELIGION DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT THE GOAL IS TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF ONE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. SEEN NO FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SINCE SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I DON'T SPEAK A LOT ON THE FLOOR AS YOU KNOW BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF PERSONAL FAMILY IMPORTANCE TO ME. ALITALIA AND WIDOW BACK INTO THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE SUCH A THING AND NOW. SHE KNEW ONE THING SHE LOVED HER SON AND SHE ACCEPTED HIM AND LOVED HIM AND HER LOVE BROUGHT FORTH ACCEPTANCE FROM A LARGE ITALIAN CATHOLIC FAMILY BECAUSE HER LOVE WAS THAT. J'AI NORMA SIN AND HEALING AND I JUMPED TO TODAY AND THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME. SCHOOLS PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT IN THEIR STUDENT HANDBOOKS AND PARENT HANDBOOKS HAVE IT ACTUALLY IN THEIR HAND BOOK TO THIS DAY. THAT SAYS IF A STUDENT FEELS THEMSELVES ATTRACTED TO A STUDENT OF THE SAME SEX. THAT THE PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE TO AGREE TO SEND THAT STUDENT TO MANDATORY COUNSELING. THAT'S TODAY AND THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND SO WHEN WE DO RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT CONVERSION THERAPY IS A SHAM AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT EVEN TODAY THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FINDING SUBTLE WAYS TO SUBJECT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE LOVED LIKE MY BROTHER WAS LOVED BY MY MOM AND NOT FORCED INTO MANDATORY COUNSELING BECAUSE THEY ARE WHO THEY ARE SO I STRONGLY RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR NINETY NINE. THANK SENATOR SENATOR BILL. OF THOSE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MENTAL HEALTH. I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT CONSIDERING THIS A MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE. I WOULD CONSIDER IT MENTAL HEALTH MALPRACTICE. AND I THINK THAT JOB. WE SHOULD NOT A- COMPARE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION WITH MEDICAL APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE DISREPUTABLE AND WE SHOULD URGE ADOPTION OF THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE THE RESOLUTION ITSELF. YOU'VE READ IT IS A VERY STRONG RESOLUTION IN FAVOR OFCOMPASSION AND SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHICH IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SO I HEARD SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. FOR EVERYBODY TO VOTE FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. DINNER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR ON A SIMILAR SUBJECT AND. JUST A RECENTLY THE LA TIMES CAME OUT WITH AN ARTICLE THE HEADLINES THAT SEXUALITY IS A COMPLEX MIX AND SO I BELIEVE IN THIS AREA WE'RE TALKING PERHAPS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT STREAMS OF. COUNSELING I ALREADY MENTIONED LAST YEAR'S SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED THAT THAT AYE AYE SOME OF THESE COUNCIL METHODS I DO NOT SUPPORT AT ALL. BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUAL COUNSELING AND SO I BELIEVE THE RESOLUTION IS BASED ON A FALSE PRESUMPTION THAT COUNSELING SOMEONE REGARDING SAME SEX ATTRACTION CANNOT INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS CONSIDERED VAGUELY AS CONVERSION THERAPY. HOW CAN WE FOR CLOSE ON SPIRITUAL COUNSELING WHEN SOMEONE IS ON A JOURNEY AND IT'S HONESTLY ENQUIRING ABOUT WANTING TO CHANGE AND ONCE PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE IT'S A COMPLEX AREA AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE IMPEDING. ON A LEGITIMATE COUNSELLING BUSINESS AS THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND I WILL BE VOTING IN OPPOSITION TO ACR NINETY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SEEN NO FURTHER DISCUSSION IN THE VERY CENTER ON BURKE WERE TO FIND WE HAVE ONE MORE. I'M SORRY SENATOR GROVE I'M STARTING NOT TO YOUR MICROPHONE. M. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. YOU'RE ALL THE WAREHOUSES IN THIS RESOLUTION ARE ARE PRETTY BENIGN AND WHERE IT SAYS RESOLVED YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR LAST YEAR I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT THERE WAS A BILL THAT CAME FORTH ON THIS FLOOR LAST YEAR AND IT HE DIDN'T SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE HAD LONG LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER. AND I THINK WHAT WHAT NEEDED TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT LAST YEAR'S ABOUT LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS IT INCLUDED YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY BOOK MATERIAL AND FOR ANY PAID THE INDIVIDUAL WELL ALL OF US THAT IT IN CHURCH REGARDLESS OF WHAT OF FAITH WE PRACTICE NO THAT THEY IN MY CASE THE BIBLE IS A BOOK RIGHT IT'S MATERIAL IN IN IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S CASE IF IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IN MY CASE A PASTOR IS PAID SO IT WOULD THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE AFFECTED PASTORS BEING ABLE TO COUNSEL INDIVIDUALS AT REALLY HEARTFELT LEAF THINKING OR SEEKING COUNSELING I KNOW THE AUTHOR LAST YEAR MET WITH SEVERAL PASTORS AROUND THE STATE AND ACTUALLY GOT THEIR INPUT AND HE WAS VERY ENGAGING WITH OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. AND FOR HIM TO COME FORWARD AND BRING THIS RESOLUTION WHERE IT SAYS RESOLVED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE RESOLVED ISSUES AND IT JUST SAYS THE LEGISLATURE CALLS ON RELIGIOUS LEADERS ALL RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO COUNSEL ON L. G. B. T. HE MANAGES A MATTERS FROM A PLACE OF LOVE COMPASSION AND KNOWLEDGE AND- YOU KNOW I'VE SPOKEN BEFORE PASTOR GROUPS ALL OVER THE STATE AND YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T. COUNSEL ON A POSITION FROM A POSITION OF LOVE AND COMPASSION AND KNOWLEDGE THAN THEY SHOULD BE COUNSELING PEOPLE IN THIS AREA AND SO AS YOU KNOW CONTRARY TO WHAT. WAS SAID ON THE FLOOR EARLIER. I MEAN TO ASK PEOPLE TO COUNSEL FROM A PLACE OF LOVE COMPASSION AND KNOWLEDGE OF.

AND NATURAL IN THE PARKS. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT. AB TWO OH NINE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON. CALIFORNIA HAS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STATE PARKS AND MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PUBLIC LANDS BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THESE LANDS. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THINKING ACCESS TO ANY OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS OUR PUBLIC LANDS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING THE OUTDOOR EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM. TARGETED TO UNDERSERVED IN AT RISK POPULATIONS SO THAT THEY MEMBERS MAY PARTICIPATE IN OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION. AND NO AND NO VOTES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT I THINK WE'RE GETTING JUST A LITTLE AHEAD OF OURSELVES ON ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL STUFF AND I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH ALL OF YOU. THERE IS A COLLEGE EDUCATION BOOK. THAT HAS A PAGE IN IT AND BASICALLY THE PAGE SAYS WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP. THEREFORE QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK NUMBER ONE. DO YOU BUY RECYCLED PAPER PURCHASE BIODEGRADABLE DETERGENTS AND CLEANING AGENTS OR MAKE MY OWN CLEANING PRODUCT PRODUCTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. YES SOMETIMES FREQUENTLY ARE OFTEN. DO YOU RECYCLE PAPER PLASTIC METALS PURCHASE REESE REFILLABLE CONTAINERS WHEN POSSIBLE AGAIN ANSWER THAT DO TRY TO WEAR YOUR CLOTHES LONGER THAN ONE TIME. SO THAT YOU CAN REDUCE WASHING WATERING CONSUMPTION IN THE AMOUNT OF DETERGENTS THAT USE. A NUMBER FOR MY FAVORITE DO YOU VOTE FOR PRO. AM ENVIRONMENTAL CANDIDATES IN ELECTIONS. SO THAT'S IN OUR AND COLLEGE EDUCATION PIECE AND IT'S LIKE. WE KEEP ADDING ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE ALMOST WHAT THE- RIGHT WHICH I AM STARTING TO AGREE WITH THEM. SAY IS INDOCTRINATION OF ARE YOU THROUGH THE EDUCATION PROCESS. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THAT. BAD I THINK WE JUST NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE. WE'RE GOING ON THE EDUCATION PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW. NEXT GENERATION IS REALLY VERY UNHAPPY WITH JUST ONE MOMENT ORGANIZED THE BACKER CHAMBER TO. SIMMER DOWN A LITTLE BIT ART INTERJECTION THIS YOUNGER GENERATION IS A LITTLE BIT UPSET WITH US BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE. AND IF YOU TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE THEY WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO BE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS SO I WOULD TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE NOTION THAT BY PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION TO OUR YOUTH IS A BAD THING IN FACT. I IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS BUT TO GET TO THE BILL AT HAND THIS BILL ASSEMBLY REQUIRES SHOULD THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND REC. TO GIVE PRIORITY FOR FUNDING OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT OUTRAGE TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE LESS INCLINED OR ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE GREAT OUTDOORS AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT THE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WITH YOU. A REPRESENT AN AREA IN THE CITY OF VENTURA. WHERE IT'S- A VERY VERY POOR AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY LIVES IT'S CALLED THE AVENUE OF INTER AVENUE MANY YEARS AGO I WENT AND SPOKE TO THE- OF FOLKS WHO DO THE EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS THERE AND ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD. RESOURCES WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THEY WOULD. DO WITH THOSE RESOURCES FOR THEIR KIDS. AND I FOUND THEIR ANSWER TO BE QUITE ASTONISHING. THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE A FIELD TRIP TO THE OCEAN. A FIELD TRIP TO THE OCEAN THE OCEAN COLLEAGUES IS TWO MILES FROM THE SCHOOL. BUT BECAUSE THESE KIDS. HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE OCEAN THEIR PARENTS ARE WORKING SO MUCH THEY DON'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE OCEAN WHICH WAS TWO MILES AWAY. SO I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I THINK WE SHOULD NOT THE RIDE THE EFFORTS THAT SOME ARE MAKING TO TRY TO EXPAND OUR HORIZONS IN THOSE OF OUR CHILDREN TO WHAT NATURE GODS GREATEST CREATION HAS OFFERED TO THEM AND WITH THAT. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IN ADDITION DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR KIRBY ARE WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I WOULD HAVE I WOULD TWO RESPONSES TO THE WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT OR EDUCATION AS AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA BARBARA SAID THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN SALINAS A LOT OF KIDS THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN THE OCEAN MORE AND WE'RE TWELVE MILES FROM THE OCEAN AS THE CROW FLIES. AND WHAT THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT IS GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET A TRANSPORTATION TO SOME OF THESE OUTDOOR IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE ALL LOVE AND APPRECIATE SO MUCH IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE INCREDIBLE OUTDOOR SPACE AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT ACCESSING THAT NUMBER TWO IS THAT THERE WAS A STUDY DONE RECENTLY THAT TALKED ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING AROUND TREES AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT TRITE BUT WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT IT THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART OF THE EXPERIMENT INDICATED HAD PHYSICAL CHANGES IN THEIR IN THEIR SYSTEM THAT RESPONDED TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE OUTDOORS IN AROUND TREES AND IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE WAS LOWERED THEIR JOB THEY THERE WAS ALL THESE BENEFICIAL. HEALTH HEALTH THINGS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME ON THEIR ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND ARE TIED THEIR HUMAN INTERACTION IS TIED TO THESE ADVICE AS WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT DOORS AND WE NEED TO SHOW THEM THAT THAT THE WORLD THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THEIR THEIR CELL PHONES AND THIS. IS REALLY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THE SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN HI ARCHULETA. ATKINS BATES. BELL.

NEXT UP ITEM ONE NINETY FIVE CENTER TO LEYVA ARE YOU PREPARED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I MEAN PLEASE READ ITEMS ARE. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE HUNDRED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND ACT REALLY INTO EMPLOYEES THE LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE CERT CERT. CERTIFICATED ACADEMIC AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AT LEAST SIX WEEKS OF FULLY PAID LEAVE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY ABSENCES RELATED TO PREGNANCY CHILDBIRTH MISCARRIAGE OR RECOVERY FROM FOLLOWING CHILDBIRTH. MANY PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THAT MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES INCLUDING SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE SDI COVERAGE SO IF AN EMPLOYEE GETS PREGNANT AND HEALTH COMPLICATIONS DUE TO PREGNANCY MISCARRIAGE OR CHILDBIRTH. SHE WAS FIRST USED HER SICK AND VACATION LEAVE IF SHE HOUSING ME AFTER THAT LEAVES EXHAUSTED THAT SHE MAY GET DIFFERENTIAL PAY WHICH IS HER PAY MINUS THE COST FOR A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FOR UP TO FIVE MONTHS. ANY WORKFORCE THAT IS OVER 70% FEMALE CURRENT LAW DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WOMEN WHO HAVE CHILDREN THAT PUTS THEM AT A SERIOUS DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES. WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY MUST CHOOSE TO SCHEDULE PREGNANCIES BASED ON THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR YEAR WOMEN WHO ALSO SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT YEARS TO HAVE CHILDREN UNTIL THEY'VE SAVED ENOUGH SICK LEAVE OR TEMP TO SURVIVE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PAY. THIS BILL ALSO WORKS TOWARDS INCREASED RISK RETENTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THE STATE IS FACING A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THE WORK FORCE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN INCENTIVIZE THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO REMAIN IN THEIR PROFESSION ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY HAVE A CHILD BY INVESTING IN NECESSARY BENEFITS THE MAKES IT LESS BURDENSOME FOR THEM TO START A FAMILY. IN FACT PREGNANCY AND CHILD CARE ARE ONE OF THE TOP REASONS SOME TEACHERS SITE FOR LEAVING THE PROFESSION STUDENTS CANNOT RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE IF OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CANNOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN GREAT TEACHERS. AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD ULTIMATELY SAVE DISTRICTS MORE FUNDS IN THE LONG RUN BUT. HELPING RETAIN TEACHERS AND ADDRESSING THE GENDER INEQUITIES IN LEAVE POLICY BY REQUIRING AT LEAST SIX WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE PREGNANCY FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SKINNER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE. THE GOAL OF AB FIVE HUNDRED I'M I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT IT PROVIDES THE BEST REMEDY TO ACCOMPLISH IT. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES PAY STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE WHICH COVERS GRILL LEAVE AND THAT WAS POINTED OUT BY THE FLOOR MANAGER INSTEAD OF IMPOSING A NEW FINANCIAL MANDATE ON PART. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS WHICH ARE ALREADY OVER BURDENED WITH EVER INCREASING PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL LIABILITIES PERHAPS THE WORK FORCE. SHOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO STI. THE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT COMBINED FOR CALIFORNIA SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS INCREASED IN THE LAST YEAR BY TWO POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A FORTY SIX PERCENT. INCREASE IN JUST ONE YEAR SO WE HAS A CAPITAL OF THE LEGISLATURE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THAT FISCAL QUICKSAND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SINKING AND- PUTTING ON ANOTHER FINANCIAL MANDATE IS FINANCIALLY IMPRUDENT ALL THE MORE SO. WHEN A NON COST ALTERNATIVE IS AVAILABLE CONSEQUENTLY COLLEAGUES I URGE A NO VOTE ON AB FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. TINA ANSWER LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WHEN YOU BRING IN A NEW EMPLOYEE WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND YOU HAVE TO TRAIN THAT EMPLOYEE AND THEN THAT WHEN PLAY ALTERNATELY LEAVES. THAT IS THE COST OF THE EMPLOYER WILL NEVER GET BACK THIS BILL AIMS AT RETAINING TEACHERS. BY ALLOWING THEM TO DO WHAT WOMEN DO WE ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN GET PREGNANT AND HAVE A CHILD SO IF WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO HELP THAT CHILD WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH PAID LEAVE. IF ONE OF MY MALE COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO TAKE TIME OFF AND HAVE A CHILD I APPLAUD THAT AND WOULD SUPPORT THEM IN THAT ENDEAVOR BUT UNTIL THEM LET'S STOP MAKING IT SO HARD FOR WOMEN TO WORK AND HAVE.

IN RECENT YEARS AS BODIES BEST SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION AIMED AT INCREASING VOTER REGISTRATION AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS HOWEVER THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING ACCESS SOME INDIVIDUALS FEEL OVERWHELMED AND SIMPLY CONFUSED BY THE PROCESS.

IF WE CONFRONT A LOVED ONE SOMEONE WHO IS IN OUR A CO WORKER IN OUR OFFICE FOR IF WE ARE AT A HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE SAY A STUDENT OR CO WORKER THERE WHO IS MAKING CREDIBLE THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BY PRESENTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR COURT THE DEMONSTRATION OF THESE CREDIBLE THREATS THAT THE RED FLAG ORDER WOULD BE ABLE TO TEMPORARILY. GET FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THESE PEOPLE NOW A RECENT STUDY AT UC DAVIS LITERALLY THAT JUST CAME OUT THIS MONTH WHERE THEY'VE BEEN OVER FOUR HUNDRED RED FLAG ORDERS ISSUED IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE BILL WAS FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT WHICH WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL BILL IT DIDN'T GO IN EFFECT TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. A MODEST NUMBER ONLY FOUR HUNDRED OF SUCH ORDERS HAVE BEEN RE ISSUED BUT OUT OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED UC DAVIS DID A DETAILED STUDY. ON A SELECT NUMBER OF THEM AND THESE WERE ALL. PEOPLE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD MADE THREATS OF MASS VIOLENCE OR MASS SHOOTINGS AND THESE PEOPLE WERE THE RED FLAG ORDER WAS ISSUED IN THE FIRE ARMS WERE REMOVED NOW WE WILL NEVER KNOW. IF THE THERE WAS ACTUALLY A MASS SHOOTING PREVENTED AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUING OF THAT ORDER BUT WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWS IS THAT THE ORDER WAS ABLE TO GIVE A TOOL TO SOMEONE WHO IF WE- KNOW THAT THEY ARE MAKING THESE CREDIBLE THREATS. AND WE CAN SHOW TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR COURT THIS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE WE CAN TEMPORARILY GET THE FIREARMS OUT OF THEIR HANDS SO AB SIXTY ONE.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MURATSUCHI AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC LANDS. SOONER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES SO I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THIS MEASURE WHICH WILL SAFEGUARD FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND AND NATIONAL MONUMENTS THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF OUR GREAT STATE. IT WILL DO SO BY PROHIBITING ANY STATE ENTITY FROM ENTERING INTO AN INFRA INCH INFRASTRUCTURE EXCUSE ME AGREEMENT TO ENABLE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ON FEDERALLY PROTECTED LANDS ON APRIL TWENTY SIX OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS ADMINISTRATION THIS PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION. ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING THE US DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF FEDERAL LANDS FOR NEW RESOURCE EXPLOITATION NAMELY OIL GAS AND MINERALS AS A RESULT OF ITS INITIAL REVIEW NATIONAL MONUMENTS IN UTAH WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN SIZE AND WE'RE OPENED UP TO MINERAL RIGHTS LEASING. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZED THE DRILLING OF A NEW WELL AN INSTALLATION OF A NEW PIPELINE WITHIN THE BEAUTIFUL COREY SO PLAIN NATIONAL MONUMENT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION FINALIZED A PLAN TO OPEN OVER ONE MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND IN CALIFORNIA THE FURTHER OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION. THIS PLAN WILL AFFECT LANDS PUBLIC LANDS IN ALAMEDACONTRA COSTA FRESNO MERCED MODERATION BENITO SAN JOAQUIN SAN MATTEO SANTA CLARA SANTA CRUZ AND STANISLAUS COUNTY. BY PROHIBITING THE ISSUANCE OF SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE LEASES THIS MEASURE WILL HELP PROTECT FEDERALLY DESIGNATED LANDS WATERS HISTORIC LANDMARKS PREHISTORIC STRUCTURES WILDLIFE NATURAL RESOURCES CRITICAL IT COSTA ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN OUR BORDERS FROM THIS ASSAULT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IN THE IDEA OF NEW LEASE IS THAT THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A RENEWAL. IF ANYONE KNOWS OTHERWISE I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT BUT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IF WE HAVE EXISTING DRILLING GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT LEASE IS IN PLACE. WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL THIS WOULD DISALLOW THAT. SO I THINK WE WILL LAY THE DISCUSSION YESTERDAY ON THE FUTURE OF FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE IMPORTATION. FROM LESS THAN DESIRABLE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INTO OUR ECONOMY. BUT I THINK IF WE IF WE THINK THIS THING THROUGH. THIS COULD HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES IN COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF BUSINESS FOLKS IN IN THE FUEL INDUSTRY. SO THAT IS MY CONCERN AND I'D I'D I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A RELENTLESS PUSH TO DRIVE THIS ENTIRE INDUSTRY OUT OF CALIFORNIA. BUT LITERALLY WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE LAW FUNDS ABILITY WE'RE GOING TO GET IT ELSEWHERE. AND I JUST DON'T I DON'T SEE THE MERIT IN THIS IF THEY'RE ABIDING BY THE RULES AND THEIR EXTRACTING IN CONFORMITY WITH OUR SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WHY ARE WE ARE PUNISHING THEM AND FORCING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. SO I THINK THIS IS OF GRAVE CONCERN EVEN THOUGH IT'S COUCHED IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. CENTER GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AGAIN YESTERDAY WE HAD A VERY BROAD DISCUSSION ON ON OIL AND CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMPTION INCREASES OF GONNA HAPPEN WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE TO BUILD TO PRODUCE IT UNDER THE MAASTRICHT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY EVER WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION YESTERDAY BUT TO ADD TO THIS 45% OF CALIFORNIA IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU'RE BASICALLY ELIMINATING THE ENTIRE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ALL THE WAY AT THE CENTER OF CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU JUST TAKE. ON A MAP AND YOU TAKE THE OUTLINE OF THE COASTAL AREA ACROSS THE TOP OF CALIFORNIAN AND DOWN TOWARDS NEVADA ARIZONA AND THEN DOWN AT THE VERY BOTTOM SANDIEGO THAT'S EVERYTHING IN THE MIDDLE IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU WOULD BE LIMITING DRILLING AND PRODUCTION AGAIN UNDER THE SAFEST ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PER PRODUCED IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. IS A DEFINITELY THE NATION SO HOW MY COMMENTS OF A LINE WITH WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID FROM FRESNO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE LEASES AND WHEN THEY GO THROUGH PERMIT PROCESSING FOR THE DIVISION OF OIL AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES A LOT OF THESE LANDS HAVE SURFACED RIGHTS AND MINERAL RIGHTS AND THEY BECOME TO DIFFERENT OWNERS SO MAYBE BE A LIMB IS THE SURFACE RIGHT ON BUT THE MINERAL RIGHT OWNER BELONGS TO AN EVEN BE NATURAL RESOURCES ARE A CHEVRON. THEN THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO GET A LOCAL DOCTOR APPROVAL AND TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DRILL ON THESE LANDS SO IT'S A DOUBLE PERMIT PROCESS AND AS WE DISCUSS DAGR YESTERDAY THERE IN INDUSTRY FUNDED ORGANIZATION THEY HAVE THE APPLICANT HAS TO APPLY FOR A PERMIT IN ORDER TO GET A DRILLING PERMIT AND THEN WHEN THEY GET A DRILLING PERMIT IT SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR APPROVAL IT SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AND THE AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARD FOR APPROVAL THEM BACK TO DOCTOR AND THEN THE APPLICANT HAS TO INDEMNIFY DAGR. WITH A BOND SO THAT WHEN THEY GET SUED BY THE- CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY YOUR. THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT. THE DOCTOR DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT THE APPLICANT DOES WHEN THEY'RE DONE THEIR DUE PROCESS. THIS IS A BLATANT ATTACK ON THE OIL INDUSTRY AND- AGAIN WE AS CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT STOPPED THE CONSUMPTION. WE CONTINUALLY INCREASE OUR USE OF CONSUMPTION ON OIL. BUT WE ARE IMPORTING THAT FROM FOREIGN NATIONS THAT ARE NOT BENEFICIAL TO AS EITHER. FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT OR A CIVIL RIGHTS STANDPOINT. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL LANDS THAT ARE OWNED. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHERE THIS RESTRICTS US FROM BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE OIL AGAIN UNDER THE STRICTEST. MOST ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REGULATORY PROCESSES EVER. WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT BUNKER FUEL I BELIEVE. AND THOSE VESSELS THAT BRING THAT OIL TO US BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO CONSUME IT WHEN IT WHEN IT ARRIVES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WE EXPORT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. OFF OF THAT PARTICULAR VESSEL AND THE COST TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. AND NOT ONLY THAT COLLEAGUES THE BUNKER FUEL THAT IS USED TO BRING THAT FUEL TO S. HAS THE HIGHEST SULFUR CONTENT. OF ANY FUEL EVER AND IF YOU'LL MAYBE THEY JUST ONE OF THOSE TRIPS YOU TO ELIMINATE ALMOST EVERY TAIL PIPE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE WEEK. AND SO I THINK IF WE LOOKED AT THIS FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE. DELEGATE PRODUCING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE IN IF NOT THE NATION THE WORLD THIS WOULD BE BETTER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND ADDRESS GLOBAL SITUATIONS AS WELL. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU IN ADDITION. IN ADDITION DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM HEARING AND SEEING NINE CENTER JACKSON GEORGIA CLOSE THANK YOU WELL I WHILE I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND LOOK FORWARD TO AT SOME POINT TALKING ABOUT OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S GOALS THEY TRY TO REDUCE OUR USE ON OIL THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT NEW LEASES NEW LEASES. NEW LEASES. NOT RENEWING NEW LEASES AND IT'S NOT ALL OVER CALIFORNIA THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY. PERTAINS TO AREAS THAT ARE IN NATIONAL MONUMENTS. THE PLACES WHERE WE TAKE OUR FAMILIES TO VACATION WHERE WE GET TO CELEBRATE THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF OUR LAND. THIS IS OUR A MEASURE THAT ADDRESSES I ENERGY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION IN OUR NATION'S HISTORIC LANDMARKS PREHISTORIC STRUCTURES WILDLIFE NATURAL RESOURCES CRITICAL ECOSYSTEMS. AND THE ENVIRONMENT AT STAKE HERE SO WHILE THIS IS A FASCINATING DISCUSSION FOR WHICH I ALWAYS APPRECIATE HEARING THE ARGUMENTS THAT EXIST ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD PAY ANY ATTENTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE OR NOT THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT THAT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT NEW LEASES IN THESE PRISTINE AND IMPORTANT AREAS. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. HI ARCHULETA ATKINS BATES. BELL.

THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ONCE AN ELECTRICAL OR GAS CORPORATION. HAS APPROVED OTHER CONSTRUCTION DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR PROJECT.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE ROUTE ASSEMBLY TO A RESOLUTION NINETEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA RELATIVE TO REFUGEES. SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS EIGHTY ARE NINETEEN CALLS UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESETTLE ALL THIRTY THOUSAND REFUGEES THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS COMMITTED TO RESETTLE IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A WELCOME HOME FOR REFUGEES RESETTLED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AM PROUD THAT MY OWN DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH MANY REFUGEES HAVE BEEN SETTLED FROM PLACES LIKE AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. FIJI RESETTLEMENT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT INVOLVES FEDERAL STATE COUNTY AND NONPROFIT ENTITY SO IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER AS UNITED EFFORT HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN FEDERAL LEVEL IN RECENT YEARS THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S FACETTI CUT THE NATION'S REFUGEE ARRIVALS AND OF HAS AFFECTED THE ELIMINATED ALMOST HALF OF THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SPOTS AVAILABLE IN THE WORLD. OUR COUNTRY HAS WELCOME FEWER THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND REFUGEES SO FAR AND MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. AT THIS RATE TODAY MISTER SHE'LL COME NOWHERE NEAR RESELLING THE THIRTY THOUSAND GOAL A GOAL WHICH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE HISTORIC AVERAGE COMMITMENT OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES ANNUALLY. CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO STAND BEHIND THIS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE POPULATION AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER AROUND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SEVENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AN ACT RELATING TO RESOURCE CONSERVATION. IN ORDER ALSO THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SPEAKER PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR WHO CAN APPLY TO JOIN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. CORPS MEMBERS LEARN SKILLS SUCH AS FORESTRY MANAGEMENT ENERGY ODDITY IN AN INSTALLATION EMERGENCY SERVICES MANAGEMENT AND FIRE FIGHTING IN OFTEN EARN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND INDUSTRY CERTIFICATIONS AT THE END OF THEIR SERVICE. AB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW BUT NOT REQUIRED THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT TO CONSIDER APPLICATIONS FROM PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND EACH APPLICATION WILL BE LOOKED AT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THIS PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING AND A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO YOUTH THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM BECOMING CORPS MEMBERS THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SENATOR NELSON. IS PRESENT IN JENIN THE SENATE THE THIS BILL HAS MERIT BUT ONLY WITH QUALIFICATIONS. IT APPEARS THAT IT ASSUMES THAT ALL PAROLEES ARE. ELIGIBLE TO YOU BE HANNAH FIRE CAN'T. IN CALIFORNIA. THE DAY DO NOT HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO BE A DANGER. THEMSELVES OR OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A FIRE CAMP. YOUR AND COMMUNITY. POST RE ALIGNMENT. OF CALIFORNIA DUMPED THOUSANDS OF INMATES AND PAROLEES INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. IN A FIRE CAMP SERVER SANCHES BEEN MORE DIFFICULT. TO GET. THE FIRE INMATE FIREFIGHTERS. AND IN THE CAMPS. IN MAY ON STAFF. AN INMATE ON INMATE. INCIDENCES OF VIOLENCE HAVE GREATLY ACCELERATED. I'VE GOTTEN CALLS FROM THE OFFICERS IN THE CAMPS OVER THE YEARS REPEATEDLY. BIG KNOWLEDGE IN THIS FACT. AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY HAVE. TO DEAL WITH IT. ALSO IT BECOMES A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. FOR MERCHANDISING AND TRANSPORTING DRUGS. IN THAT FREE ENVIRONMENT. FIGHTING FIRES IN THE POOREST IN THE WILD LANDS. ALWAYS VERY EASY TO FIND PICK UP SPOTS. THAT TRAFFIC MOVES. IF THIS WERE RESTRICTED THEN TO CERTAIN CLASSIFICATION SCORES WHILE IN PRISON. CERTAIN REHABILITATIVE REQUIREMENTS. THEN I WOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT IT DOES NOT. IT IS SIMPLY A NOTHER WAY. TO GET MORE INDIVIDUALS OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES SOME OF WHICH- NOT BE THERE. SENATOR DALLY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESENT MEMBERS ACTUALLY RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS TRIED EMPLOYEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD MISFORTUNE IN THEIR LIVES IT IS DIFFICULT AS AN EMPLOYER TRUST ME TO TRY TO GET A PAROLE THE BACK ON THEIR FEET IN. AND MAY AND I'VE BEEN CHALLENGED AND TRY TO HELP THOSE FOLKS BUT I'VE I LOOKED AT THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK GET A SKILL. AND MAYBE YEAH THERE'S GOING TO BE OPPORTUNITIES BUT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES WITH. ANYONE IN THIS FIELD THAT HAS COME OUT OF THAT. SITUATION AND I THINK THAT. THE WRIST THAT WE'RE TAKING IS MINIMAL THEY THEY DID TAKES AMENDMENTS WERE SEX OFFENDERS. COULDN'T BE ALL IN THIS PROGRAM AND I'M ENCOURAGED OF SOMEBODY WHO ALL MY LIFE LIVED A MILE AND A HALF. FROM A CONSERVATION CAMP. THAT HAD NO LOCKS ON THE GATES ONE WARDEN WATCHING THEM. THERE THE WHOLE TIME THEY'RE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY AB ONE OH NINE. AS PUSHED OUT IN PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND FORTY SEVEN HAVE. YOU'LL PUT MORE PEOPLE ON THE STREET BUT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO REHABILITATE THESE PEOPLE. TRAIN THEM SO THEY ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO WORK AND THEN TRY TO GET THEM BACK IN THE WORK FORCE. ANY WE JUST WERE ABLE TO GET A FEW IT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIETY SO I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I WILL BE WATCHING IT TO SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL IS TO TRY TO BREAK THAT RESET IS IN RATE OF FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM. I CONTINUALLY ARE INCARCERATED THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRAIN THEM UP GIVE THEM SOME SELF PRIDE BE ABLE TO HAVE A JOB. DO SOME THINGS WE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE FIRE SAFE OUR COMMUNITIES SEVERAL FOLKS ARE OUT WORKING RIGHT NOW IN THE FORCED THINNING AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT WERE INCARCERATED BEFORE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK IT'S A GOOD START. AND YES THERE'S ALWAYS RISK IN EVERYTHING YOU DO BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THOSE RISKS. TO HELP SOME OF THOSE OUT THAT MAY BE MISFORTUNE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU THE PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WE TAKE A QUESTION YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN MY READ OF AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT IT WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE LEAST TO THEN BE CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION IN IN IN THE CONSERVATION CORPS IS THAT CORRECT MIGHT WRONG. THANK YOU MAY RESPOND YES THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU SO IT OR TO READ ABOUT PAROLEES YES ON MY OWN TIME IS THE PRESIDENT PEOPLE ALREADY SERVED THEIR TIME AND HAD BEEN PAROLED BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE WHAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES I WOULD FURTHER REMIND ALL OF US. THAT WOMEN WOMEN I BELIEVE THAT COMPRISE CAL FIRE OUR CURRENT EDC OUR RESIDENTS FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM. 40% OF CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS ARE CURRENT RESIDENTS THE CDC OUR THAT'S OUR CURRENT STATUS QUO AND AS I RECALL AND BUDGET COMMITTEE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH TO EXPAND FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE I HOPE TO STAND CORRECTED IF THIS IS THAT THIS FACT IS NOT TRUE. THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A REPORT. A COMMUNITY MEMBER. ABOUT A CD C. R. FIREFIGHTER BEING INAPPROPRIATE. OR AND SOMEHOW SOME WAY COMPROMISE IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY SEPARATE POPULATION I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT TO GIVE PAROLEES. WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND HAVE BEEN PAROLED BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE CONSERVATION CORPS TO RECEIVE TRAINING. AND EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT OUR AND FOR FEEL THEIR RE ENTRY EXPECTATIONS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEST A SOLUTION TO POVERTY AND BEING A JOB AND THEN THE BEST SOLUTION TO KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A JOB OF TO KEEP THEM OUT OF PRISON BECAUSE I THINK THAT SHOWS A SELF ACCOUNTABILITY THIS WORK IS NOT EASY IT'S HARD IT'S ON A FIRE LINE IT'S DIGGING TRENCHES IT'S SEPARATING BRASH IT'S NOT EASY WORK IT'S VERY HARD WORK. AND I THINK THAT WHEN THEY FINISH THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM THEY HAVE DEVELOP SKILLS THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE EXCEPT FOR ON A JOB AND THAT'S GETTING UP SHOWING UP ON TIME BEING AT WORK ON TIME DOING A GOOD JOB AND IT ALSO I THINK GIVES THEM A SELF IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING AND SERVING THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WITH FIRE LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY PROTECT HOMES AND PEOPLE'S HOMES AND THEIR RESOURCES AND WHAT THEY REQUIRED TO BE TAKEN NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO OUT AND WORK ON THE FIRE LINE. AGAIN IT DOES IT PRESENT IT PREVENTS RECIDIVISM FROM PEOPLE RETURNING ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO PRISON AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IT'S A READ SPONSOR BULL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT JUST DOESN'T ALLOW CRIMINALS OUT TO LET THEM RUN FREE AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AT ANY TIME LIKE YOU KNOW RIPOFF ELDERLY PEOPLE AT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY JUST GET A TICKET THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WORK IN A WAY AND DEVELOP SKILLS AND ABILITY TO KEEP THEM OUT OF PRISON SO I WOULD SUPPORT.

SENATOR JOCKS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES RECYCLING SOMETHING THAT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF FOR THE FUTURE THIS PLANET BUT ONE THAT IS HAD A- CHALLENGING. GO ADD TO MAKING THINGS ACTUALLY HAPPEN AS INTENDED THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCIES THAT EXIST IN THE CARPET STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. AND TO IMPROVE INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMERS TO BUY EASIER TO RECYCLE CARPET OR CARPET WITH RECYCLED MATERIAL CONTENT. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR A BRIDGE PLAN IN THE CASE OF STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION CEASES OPERATION OR A PLAN IS DISAPPROVED. TO PROTECT CONSUMER FEES AND CONTINUING TO CONTINUE RECYCLING THE BILL REQUIRES THE TRANSFER OF THE AN EXPANDED CONSUMER FEES TO BE DEPOSITED INTO A TRUST OR ESCROW ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. NOW DO DO A HISTORY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING AND RECOVERY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAL RECYCLE. NEEDS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT TO MEET OUR STATE RECYCLING GOALS TO DO THIS THIS BILL INCREASES THE AMOUNT AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE CAN ASSESS FOR A CIVIL PENALTY IN ORDER. TO TRY TO GAIN GREATER COMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION THE BILL REMOVES IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CAP IN ALLOWS CAL RECYCLED TO FULLY RECOVER ITS ADMINISTRATIVE IN ENFORCEMENT COSTS FOR THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS WHAT WE DO FOR OTHER A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS AND FINALLY THE BILL DIRECTS THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION TO IMPLEMENT A DIFFERENTIAL ASSESSMENT. THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO BUY GREENER CARPETS THE GOALS OF THE BILL ARE SIMPLY TO GIVE. OUR OR TO MAKE RECYCLING OF CARPETS IN THIS MATERIAL MORE ATTRACTIVE AND AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THIS BILL WILL GIVE OF CAL RECYCLE THE TOOLS TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM TO MEET OUR STATE'S RECYCLING GOALS IN WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR GROW. MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION OF THIS I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YOU GUYS TO THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE PICTURE ON THINGS IBM. I RECENTLY GOT CALLED TO GO TO A TRAILER PARK EACH CD NEEDED SOME HELP WITH SOME STUFF GOING ON AND WHEN WE GOT THERE THEY WERE MATTRESSES AND CARPET AND BUGS AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS NASTY LIKE NO ONE SHOULD LIVE LIKE THAT AND SO WE WALK THROUGH WE GOT AT CITY SERVED COMMITTED TO A COMPLETE CLEAN AT. GOT TRASHED COMPANIES TO DONATE THEIR OF DUMPSTERS TO DO A CLEAN UP AND THE RESIDENTS REALLY TOOK PART IN IT BUT I MEAN YOU GUYS KNOW ME RIGHT I GET OUT THERE WITH ALL THOSE RESIDENTS AND I'M LIKE HW DO YOU LIVE LIKE THIS LIKE WHAT WHAT IS THE DEAL HOW DO YOU LIVE LIKE THIS THIS MAKES NO SENSE THAT SHE WOULD LIVE IN THIS GARBAGE. AND ONE OF THE RESIDENTS SPOKE UP AND HE GOES WELL. IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE BLUE CAN. IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE BROWN CAN. IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE GREEN CAN. I DON'T HAVE A TRUCK. TO HAUL IT TO THE LANDFILL. AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THE FEE. SO IT ENDS UP. RIGHT THERE. AND I JUST THOUGHT WELL WHAT A REALITY CHECK AND I HAD NO IDEA. THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES AND WHEN I TALK TO MY COUNTY CHAU. AND I CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU GUYS TO TALK TO YOUR COUNTY CIOS HE SAYS THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE ONE ILLEGAL DUMPING. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH TAKING. THESE THINGS TO THE LANDFILLS. AND SO IT'S EITHER PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO DO IT THAT WON'T DO IT TO THE DO ILLEGAL DUMPING. OR IT'S THE POOR. THAT WE SERVE. THAT LIKE THAT RESIDENT SAID. DOESN'T FIT IN THE BLUE CAN DOESN'T FIT IN THE GREEN CAN DOESN'T FIT IN THE BROWN CAN. AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY OR THE VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT THIS TO A LANDFILL. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK. ON A BROADER SCALE. I REALIZE WE ALL WANT TO DRESS. ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES BUT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE CONSTITUENTS WE SERVE AND SEE HOW IT'S AFFECTING THEM DIRECTLY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE. A NO VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR ALAN I JUST TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS ABOUT MY FRIEND I YOU KNOW I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A CORPORATE RECYCLING FACILITY I HEAR THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED I SHARE SOME OF THE BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT. HAVING YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO EVEN TRUSTED IN ENSURING THAT THERE IS A GOOD PROGRAM IN PLACE I HAVE THE POWER TO. YOU KNOW TO ENSURE THIS CAN MAKE IT PROGRAM AND IF YOU TALK TO FOLKS IN ADMINISTRATION THEY WILL GIVE YOU. A SERIES OF VERY. HEALTH CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. SO I'M I'M COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO STAY ON THE AGENCY AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY. TO ENSURE THAT WE COME UP WITH IS A GOOD OUTCOMES HERE. BY IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS REACHES THE GOALS. THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO REACH AND- YOU KNOW I'S GONNA INVOLVE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BUT I GUESS I INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO. TO REALLY ENGAGE. AT TO ENSURE THAT THE WE REACH OUR GOALS HERE AND THAT'S WHY I'M COMFORTABLE BUT WHEN THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. SEE NINE CENTER JACKSON DO YOU LIKE CLOSE PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. YOU SEE PART OF WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO DO IS TO FIND A WAY THAT THESE PRODUCTS WILL NOT JUST BE DUMPED OUT ON THE STREET THAT IS THE GOAL. SO THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO OR IS INTENDED TO AND THUS THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IS GOING TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL. OF HAVING CARPET INSTALLERS TAKE BACK THE CARPET WHEN THEY PUT THE NEW CARPET. AND THAT WHEN A PROFESSIONAL COMES TO INSTALL A FLOOR THEY WILL REMOVE THE CARPET THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS BILL WHICH IS I THINK A VERY LAUDATORY GOLDEN ONE WHICH I THINK WE- SHOULD CERTAINLY ALL SUPPORT. ARE THERE IS A PROCESS NOW THAT'S BEING EVALUATED WE'VE SEEN AREAS WHERE WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A PEOPLE. THIS IS AN EFFORT NOW TO GET INTO PERHAPS THE RECYCLING TWO POINT OH ON THIS THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. IS TRYING TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO INSTALL THE NEXT ROUND TO TAKE THOSE MATERIALS AND GET RID OF THEM THE WAY WE DO WITH TIRES FRANKLY. WHEN YOU GO TO GET A NEW SET OF TIRES YOU GIVE THE YOU GIVE THE COMPANY THE OLD SET OF TIRES AND YOU PAY A SMALL FEE. AND THOSE TIRES AND THEN REMOVED SO THAT THEY'RE NOT IN A LANDFILL OR WHERE WE END UP WITH THESE. TIRE FIRES A GO ON FOR A YEAR OR TWO OR THREE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO BE A RETURN PROGRAM A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO WORK ON AND TO IMPROVE UPON AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

MISS SECTOR PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AN ACT RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION PLANNING MEMBERS I DEDICATE THIS PRESENTATION OF BURNED AT AND RISES A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THE V. TWO EIGHTY FIVE BY SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND BASICALLY IT REQUIRES THAT THE D. O. T. INCORPORATE CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS SUCH AS THE SB THIRTY TWO IN THE STATE THEIR QUALITY PLANS INTO. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES OF THIS REGION GROWTH COUNCIL CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THE C. D. P. IN CONSIDER WAYS TO BETTER COURTNEY THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS HI THIS IS AN IMPORTANT UPDATE THE BILL HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES IS SUPPORTED BY. COVERING TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION UTILITIES THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR MANY MORE. AND I RESPECT FOR US FROM ABOUT. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STONE. THERE'S STILL THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT FELLOW COLLEAGUES ARE AS IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS JUST OTHER TEMP BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO TELL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES IT'S REALLY AS SIMPLE AS THIS IS LEGISLATURE SET ARBITRARY NON REALISTIC GREENHOUSE GAS AND OTHER CLAMOR RELATED TARGET DATES AND THE ONLY WAY TO EVEN APPROACH THOSE GOALS IS TO FORCE THE BASSNUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND THAT IS THAT ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THEM THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS ALIGNS WITH THE GOALS OF REDUCING VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND TRAVEL AND SHIFTING FUNDING PRIORITIES AWAY FROM SYSTEMS PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE LIKE ROAD REYES AND FREEWAYS TOWARDS TRANSIT INDUSTRY IN A BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH MOST CALIFORNIANS BY CHOICE EARNERS SAYS CITY DO NOT USE SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE USING ITS OWN AGENDA THE FORCE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO OR SHOULDN'T LET INDIVIDUALS PURSUE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS BELIEVE ME. IN MY DISTRICT RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE PEOPLE COMMUTE FIFTY PLUS MILES A DAY EACH WAY TO WORK PURSUING HAPPINESS IS NOT WRITING ON A BIKE FOR HOURS EACH DAY TO GET TO AND FROM THEIR JOBS CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A LEADER IN DEVELOPING ENCOURAGING ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES ENERGY OUR CITIZENS TO BUY THEM BY OFFERING REBATES AND OTHER INCENTIVES CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLES ARE JUST GETTING CLEANER EVERY YEAR. NOW JUST AS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY STARTED TO TAKE HOLDEN FLOORS THE SALE OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES CONTINUE TO GROW THIS BILL SEEKS TO REPLACE THE VERY ROSE THOSE VEHICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE ON EVER ASKING THE PUBLIC TO ADOPT THESE EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT WHY AREN'T OUR FUNDING DECISIONS REFLECTED THAT BY INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE ROADS AT THESE VEHICLES WILL NEED WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE. AND WE ALL WANT CLEAN WATER TO DRINK PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN IS IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHILE IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER ALL THE ELEMENTS OF PLANNING FUNDAMENTALLY THE ROLE OF PLANNING. IS NOT AND SHOULD NEVER BE TO FORCE PEOPLE TO BEHAVE. HAS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS THEM TO BUT RATHER TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH THE TOOLS TO BEHAVE AS THEY SEE FIT CLEARLY. THIS IS A NOTION THAT'S BEEN LOST ON THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT QUESTION FOR THE OR MANAGER RECENT TRENDS IN ORDER TO I THINK. IT'S A QUESTION. PLEASE SIDE OF COURSE WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION I WILL TRY MY BEST. BIGGER CINEMA YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER. WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE IN THE USE OF TRANSIT IN ORANGE COUNTY AND LA COUNTY IN FACT WE'VE BEEN REDUCING BUS LINES WE'VE BEEN. NO JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA THE TREND LINE IS NOT GOOD SO. WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE OTHER THAN. NOT BUILDING ROADS. WHICH IS KIND OF A COMPANY IN APPROACH BUT WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO INCENTIVIZE THAT'S QUESTION ONE NUMBER TWO IS. IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT TRANSIT AND MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE. RAPID TRANSIT. THERE'S OR AN IDEA OF PERSONAL RAPID TRANSIT WHICH WOULD BE ON A ON A REAL LINE BUT BUT NOW WITH CARS BEING ABLE TO DRY THEMSELVES. SHOULD WE BE LOOKING. AT THAT IS A TRANSIT OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOU CAN JUST ON YOUR IPHONE. REQUEST A VEHICLE TO SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE AT A CERTAIN TIME TO TAKE YOU TO A CERTAIN DEFINITION JUST LIKE WE'RE KIND OF DOING WAS SCOOTERS AND BICYCLES. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE NEED TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. YEAH I APPRECIATE ACTION VERSION THE QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY IT'S INTERESTING I ON THE FIRST QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED. ON ONE OF THE MOVE LA HAS DONE A STUDY ON THIS ISSUE OF DECLINING TRANSIT AND IT APPEARS AT LEAST FROM WHAT THEIR POSITING. THAT AS IN OURS IN OUR IN OUR BIG METROPOLITAN AREAS AND FOLKS GET ORE RESOURCES THEY'VE TENDED TO. GET CARS AND THE POVERTY RATES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE OF THE CITIES HAVE ACTUALLY DECLINED AND THAT HAS IN ECONOMY COURSES BEEN STRONG. AND SO FOLKS HAVE OPTED FOR PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION I THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT INCENTIVIZING IT'S ABOUT BUILDING CLEAN RELIABLE SAFE. PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS AND YOU YOU KNOW WOULD YOU GO TO PLACES LIKE LONDON OR NEW YORK AND YOU'VE GOT. YOUR FOLKS IN IN IN SUITS WHO ARE GOING TO YOU KNOW SEVEN FIGURE JOBS WERE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO SCHOOL KIDS AND FOLKS IN POVERTY ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE- THIS IS IT IT'S PART OF THE CULTURE THEY'RE SAFE THEY'RE CLEAN THE RELIABLE PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW THEY CAN GET TO. WORK JUST AS FAST IF NOT FASTER ON THE ON THE TWO MORE ON THE SUBWAY AS THEY CAN IN THEIR IN THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR ITS PART OF WHY WE FOUGHT TO GET PUBLIC TRANSIT FUNDING INTO SB ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'D BE SIMPSON FUNDING FOR SAFE CLEAN RELIABLE TRANSIT. I WOULD SAY THE NOTHING IN THE. I THINK WITH THIS WITH THIS SEEKS TO DO WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS FOCUS ON. TRYING TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS AND TO AND POLLUTION REDUCTION GOALS. ARE I THINK ACTUALLY I DON'T CENTER SKINNER AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING QUITE A BIT ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE DO. MOVE INTO A TRANSPORTATION. REVOLUTION WITH THE GUARDS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND OTHERS WE DO SO MINDFULLY AND WE DO SO. IN A WAY THAT THE THAT SEEKS TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND THAT COULD BE DONE. BY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE VEHICLES ARE LOWER ADMITTING THAT THEY MADE. ELECTRIC THAT'S ALL PART OF THE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW SO. IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ALL THE V. FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THAT'S A WAY TO GET PEOPLE AROUND WHILE ALSO REDUCING OUR OUR EMISSIONS SO. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING I THINK WE APPROPRIATE FOR THE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION YOUR GOVERNOR BERMAN OF TRANSPORTATION AND STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO LOOK AT. AS THE IMPLEMENT THIS BILL AS A DRAFT THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE COVERAGES VISION PLAN NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING. A CONFLICTING IN SOME IN WHICH YOU ASKED ABOUT. THANK YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT JUST THE CLOTHES I THINK WE NEED TO START THINKING A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAT IT FOUR BUILDING CARS. WITH THAT LOTUS ZERO EMISSIONS. AND THAT HELPS THE- ENVIRONMENT MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT. HOW TO MOVE PEOPLE QUICKER MAYBE IT TO LANES NOT TRAINS. AND WE JUST NEED TO MAYBE. RETHINK HOW WERE REVIEWING OUR FUTURES. AND OUR OUR MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE TO. JOBS. PLANNING PROCESS TO MAKE OUR ROADS. WORK BETTER. TO MAKE TRANSIT WORK AND TO MAKE TRAVEL BETTER FOR. THE PUBLIC WE CAN'T. IN MANY CASES PROBABLY MOST CASES IN URBAN AREAS. BILL MORE LANDS ON A FREEWAYS HOW YOU GOT A- HOW YOU GOT A COMPLETE YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP ADDING LANES IN THE URBAN AREAS YOU HAVE TO MAKE AS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT'S A COMBINATION TRANSIT HIGHWAYS OF OTHER EFFICIENCIES WITH FREIGHT MOVEMENT. AND I'D LIKE TO QUOTE. AS I DID WHEN WE DEBATED SB WANT I LIKE TO QUOTE. THE BIBLE IF I COULD MISTER MISTER PRESIDENT WE WERE TOLD TO MAKE THE ROAD THE CROOKED ROAD STRAIGHT. AND THE ROUGH ROADS MOVE. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO CONTINUE THE SP ONE DICTUM THAT WE SAID DURING THE DEBATE ON SB ONE HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBERS I DON'T USE THAT QUOTE AGAIN QUICKER ROAD STRAIGHT. AND THE ROUGH ROADS MOVE THAT'S WE'RE. GOING TO DO. I REGION I HERE'S AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MATTER. ANY ADDITION IS DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THE SIDE ON SCENE ON. CENTRE ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE TAKEN IS TO SEARCH. OR SYNAGOGUE OR TEMPLE MOSCOW WITH REGARDS TO THE THAT COMMON THAT'S ACTUALLY A WONDERFUL PORTION OF THE MESSIAH HANDEL'S MESSIAH. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT SO I BUT I DO APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS I JUST YOU KNOW TO KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES WERE RAISED BY MY- FRIEND FROM TO MACULA I'M IN THE END OF THE DAY WHY WOULD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING. POLLUTION INTO ACCOUNT AIR QUALITY INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE'RE MAKING OUR TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS. I MEAN THE END OF THE DAY ALL THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN IT DOESN'T. FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE PLANNING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IT JUST SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT ARE TO BE TAKEN ACCOUNT ONLY. MAKE THESE DECISIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY I'M SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE HAD TERRIBLE AIR QUALITY AND WE STILL HAVE A BETTER QUALITY IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT THERE WAS IT WAS A POINT WHERE I THINK SOME MEMBERS ARE RULES REALLY REMEMBER. WHEN YOU CAN BARELY SEE THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN. JUST JUST DRIVING THROUGH LA BECAUSE THE SMOG LEVELS ARE SO BAD THANK GOD WE HAD THE FORESIGHT AS GOVERNMENT. TO SAY YOU KNOW ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WERE ACTUALLY COMMITTED CHILD ABUSE AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF LOS ANGELES WE'RE GONNA TAKE POLLUTION INTO ACCOUNT AND WE START MAKING DECISIONS.
