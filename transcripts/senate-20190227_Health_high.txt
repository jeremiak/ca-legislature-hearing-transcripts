ORDERS THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON IMPROVING PERFORMANCE IN ALIGNING INCENTIVES IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND MEDICAL. AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTS IN HEALTH CARE -- EXPANDING ACCESS TO MORE PEOPLE WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE DESPITE THE GAINS WE THREE MADE WITH THE ACA WE STILL HAVE A BY THINK ABOUT 7% -- UNINSURED -- CERTAINLY COST TO SOMETHING THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN AS A AS NOT ONLY -- GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO -- INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS -- AND AND UNIONS WHO -- US BUT ALSO WE THINK ABOUT -- THOSE COSTS WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DELIVERING CARE BE SURE THAT PEOPLE NOT ONLY HAVE COVERAGE BUT THEY ACTUALLY TRULY OF ACCESS AND ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. AND THAT ACTUALLY WE INVEST AND CREATE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE -- TO TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE THAT CAN BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND HELP LOWER THE LONG TERM COST CURVE. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- CITIES HAVE SHOWN APPROXIMATELY LEAST ONE CHRONIC CONDITION -- SO LOOK -- AND THAT -- THAT REPRESENTS PRACTICALLY SPENDING. SO WE REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO NOT ONLY BEEN THE COST CURVE BUT ALSO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY -- IT IS LOOKING AT CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CREATE THE KIND OF STRUCTURES INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE -- TO INVEST IN CHRONIC DISEASE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CERTAINLY. WE OFTEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS THIS -- WE THAT -- WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES OR ASTHMA OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- OFTEN THERE THE EXPENSES OF THEIR THAT CARE MAY ACTUALLY BE GREATER THAN THE PREMIUMS THEY PAY AND SO -- RISK BRING ALWAYS ASIA HEALTH PLANS OFTEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT LIKE HOW DOOR TO FINANCE THEM THEY HAVE TO HAVE FOR THE CALL PROPER CASE MIX RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH HEALTHY PEOPLE TO PAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE THESE. CONDITIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THAT ALSO BECOMES A DISINCENTIVE -- PERHAPS. TWO PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANTING. TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND ALSO IN PROVIDING DEVELOPING -- BETTER SYSTEMS CARE NOTHING IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. EDITION. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE PLAN THAT'S BEST KNOWN AS TAKING CARE OF A PARTICULAR CHRONIC CONDITION ARE MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE IF YOU TRACK MORE OF THOSE PATIENTS THAT. AGAIN MIXES UP YOUR CASE MIX -- SO THOSE ARE CERTAINLY SOME DISINCENTIVES THAT ARE POSSIBLY THERE BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STRUCTURE THINGS. AND WE ALSO HAVE MODELS OUT THERE TO TAKE MORE COST EFFECIVE CARE SO I HOPE TODAY -- WE HAVE AGREED TO SAID THE SPEAKERS WERE GOING LOOKING AT THE DATA -- AND THEY KNOW WE HAVE DOCTOR RIGHT OUT WHO'S GOING TO BE STARTING US OFF WITH THE THE CAN'T. HEALTHCARE QUALITY COST IT BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE -- STRATEGIES A THAT'S GOING PRESENTED BY COVERED CALIFORNIA CALPERS PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH REALLY LOOK AT MEDI CAL BECAUSE MEDI CAL AND COVERS. A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY FOR ME IS A FEATURE SHOULD HALF OF ALL CHILDREN HAVE ALL THE LIVERIS IS A CERTAINLY A LARGE PLAYER. IN. IN IN THIS SPACE AND THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE BEND THE CURVE AND BEND THE NEEDLE -- BECAUSE THAT ALSO SAY THAT IS A POSITION MYSELF -- THAT ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE FRONT LINES OF CARE OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- NOW WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT PLANS AND ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO PROVIDE DOWN THE INCENTIVES ARE THINGS TO YOUR P. FOR PETER THE TYPES OF THINGS -- TERMINOLOGY AND ACRONYMS OF PAY FOR PERFORMANCE. TO THIRTY IS A CITY IN THE ACCIDENTS HERE BUT PAY FOR PERFORMANCE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO TRY TO GET YOU KNOW ME IN MY OFFICE TO DO THINGS BUT YET. OFTEN THEY'RE NOT AT SCALE RIGHT AND SO AM I GONNA CHANGE THE WHOLE WAY MY OFFICE DOES SOMETHING BECAUSE A PLAN THAT PROVIDES CARE 220% MY PATIENTS. AND THAT INCENTIVE ISN'T REALLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST OF THAT TRANSFORMATION OFFICE TRANSFORMATIONS HOW DO WE GET THAT KIND OF TIPPING POINT TO ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND THINK ABOUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT CERTAINLY TODAY. HOPEFULLY THIS THROUGH THIS INFORMATION HEARING WILL MAKE YOUR A LOT OF INTERESTING IDEAS -- BE YOU'VE BECOME AWARE OF A LOT OF DATA -- THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL TO US AND THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF POLICIES YOU MIGHT WANNA CRAFT AS A STATE AND ALSO WHAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS WHO WANT TO HAVE CITY HAPPENED THAT WILL LEAD US. AS HIS MOVE US TOWARD -- NOW WE BETTER ACCESS BUT ALSO BETTER QUALITY AND OF WE ALSO MORE COST EFFICIENCY IN THE CARE OF A FEW OF OUR CHRONIC CONDITIONS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THINK OF ONLY. FILL MEMBERS ARE BEING HERE I KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE WANT TO MAKE SOME REMARKS. OKAY ALL RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS RATE AGO SO TO START WITH AN FIRST -- PANEL IN A IS ACTUALLY DOCTOR JEFFREY RIGHT OUT SEE OF THE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATION GIVING US AN OVERVIEW THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND COST. DATA ATLAS WELCOME THANK YOU. MEMBERS AND DOCTOR PAN SPECIFICALLY FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE TORSION AGRAHARA WHO'S THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE WITH AJ THAT OWNS MOST OF THIS WORK AND HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB. AND WITH -- SECTOR DO WE IN THE AUDIENCE I WAS GONNA DO THIS ANYWAY BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER LEADERSHIP ON THE ALICE IN PARTICULAR THAT SO. BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EASY TO BE OVERWHELMED WITH THE INFORMATION WHAT I'M GONNA TRY TO DO IS JUST HELP MAKE EVERYBODY AWARE OF A FANTASTIC TOOL. THAT AT THE DISPOSAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY WAS BORN OUT OF THIS. CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT -- FIRST AS AN ORGANIZATION WE'RE KIND OF A STRANGE. AND ODD AND AND SOMEBODY INTERESTING ORGANIZATION WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE ARE A NOT FOR PROFIT. AND WE HAVE A COLLECTION OF VERY STRANGE BEDFELLOWS HEALTH PLANS A PROVIDER GROUPS HEALTH SYSTEMS -- WE HAVE -- CONSUMER GROUPS WE HAVE PURCHASERS ALL AT THE TABLE I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TO THE THREE PANELISTS IT WILL FOLLOW ME OUR MEMBERS BY JAY IS WHERE MEMBERS. WE DON'T ACCEPT IT ASSOCIATIONS -- BY OUR BYLAWS SO -- BUT WE DO DO A LOT OF WORK WITH PPG AGE AND WE DO GET A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS AT A LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT COUNTLESS IS ONE OF THEM BUT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP AFTER A LONG STANDING PROGRAM CALLED CAMP -- DETAILS HERE THAT ARE IMPORTANT AMP ACTUALLY IS A P. FOR P. PROGRAM IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IT'S THE LARGEST ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODEL N THE COUNTRY AND SUPPORTS ABOUT NINE MILLION COMMERCIAL HMO MEMBERS. IT'S UNIT OF MEASUREMENT IS THE PROVIDER GROUP SOON IPA OR MEDICAL GROUP IS THE PRIMARY UNIT OF ANALYSIS. INFORMATION FROM CAMP HAS BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PA FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND IT MEASURES QUALITY PATIENT EXPERIENCE WHICH I KNOW IS IMPORTANT THIS COMMITTEE -- AND ALSO TOTAL COST OF CARE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME THROUGHOUT THIS TOTAL COST OF CARE INCLUDING PATIENT COST SHARING IS A BIG PART OF THE MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. THE ATLAS PROGRAM IS NEWER WERE IN OUR COUPLE OF WEEKS THIS STARTED -- ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO FUNDING FOR THIS CAME FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FUNDING FOR THE AMP PROGRAM IS LARGELY THROUGH THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS. WHO SUBMIT DATA? POURTANT TO NOTE THAT THE HAPLESS PROGRAM INCLUDES OVER TWENTY NINE MILLION. INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S BY FAR ONE THE LARGEST SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY IT ALSO INCLUDES MEDICARE DATA. ON COMMERCIAL HMO DATA AND HAS INFORMATION AVAILABLE BY DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES LIKE A A SO OR SELF FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW IS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE PUT THIS ON A SINGLE PLATFORM. SO THESE ARE SEPARATE PROGRAMS AT ALL DROP FROM THE SAME DATA THE SAME FOR MATCH THE SAME MEASURES SO EVERYTHING IS STANDARDIZED AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE LIFT IT'S KIND OF A BEHIND THE SCENES LEFT. BUT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANY SORT OF COMPARISONS THAT HAVE MEANING ACROSS PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND PROVIDER -- PROVIDER SYSTEMS. KEY TAKE AWAYS SO THIS IS -- REALLY. KIND OF THE THE PUNCHLINE I'LL GIVE YOU SOME ANALYSIS IF YOU'D LIKE AFTER THIS -- THERE'S WIDE VARIATION IN QUALITY AND COST THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IT'S PERSISTENT OVERTIME IT'S PERSISTENT OVER PRODUCT LINES -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND URBAN AREAS TEND TO BE HIGHER ON QUALITY BUT THE CABBIE OUT THERE IS. NOT ALWAYS AND THERE'S A WIDE VARIATION NO MATTER WHAT YOU MEASURE NO MATTER WHERE YOU MEASURE QUALITY. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES BETTER ON TOTAL COST OF CARE IN GENERAL I THINK WE UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE TRENDS -- THE DATA IN THE ATLAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTS PRECISE ANALYSIS SOMEWHAT THAT MEANS. THERE'S LESS VARIATION IN MEDIC COW BUT ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES THAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH HERE TODAY IS THE DATA THAT WE HAVE FOR MEDI CAL IS MORE LIMITED. AND SO WE CAN DO SOME ANALYSIS BUT IT IS NOT AS ROBUST OR AS COMPLETE AS IT IS ON THE COMMERCIAL MEDICARE SIDE SO SOME OF WHAT WE CAN DO. ON THE COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE SIDE WE CAN'T AT THIS POINT DO ON THE MEDICAL SIDE. HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS THAT USE INTEGRATED NETWORKS -- THOSE ARE MEDICAL GROUPS AND I. P. A.'S ATTENDED AND TAKE FINANCIAL RISK ACTUALLY SO SUPERIOR COST AND QUALITY PROFILES. RELATIVE TO NON INTEGRATED NETWORKS AND THAT INCLUDES AGAIN THE PATIENT CARSHARING COMPONENT OF THAT -- AND FINANCIAL REASSURING IN THE FORM OF CAPITATION GIN TRYING NOT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL ABOUT THIS BUT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A DIRECT CORRELATION. TO OVERALL QUALITY AND TOTAL COST OF CARE PERFORMANCE SO IN SIMPLE TERMS THE MORE RISK AN ORGANIZATION TAKES. EE AND AND COMFORTABLY THE BETTER THEY SEEM TO DO ON BOTH QUALITY AND COST. OF NOTE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH YOU I'M SURE OF HEARD OF IN OUR ANALYSIS THEY PERFORM BETTER TAN NETWORKS THAT ARE NOT INTEGRATED BUT THEY DON'T PERFORM BETTER THAN THE INTEGRATED NETWORKS THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS SO THERE'S VARIATION -- AND AGAIN THE LACK OF MEDICAL DATA T THIS POINT IN ARE PROCESS SEEMS TO LIMIT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE MOST INTERESTING GIVEN THE GROWTH IN MEDICARE MEMBERSHIP [inaudible] YEAH. THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S ROLLED IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS LIKE FOR MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO IT TO DATA FOR US YES START ARE UP TO YOU -- I THINK THE THE BEST ANSWER IS THIS WHOLE PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A VOLUNTARY MULTI PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. SO WE GET THIS INFORMATION FROM THE HEALTH PLANS BASED ON THEIR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE IT TO US -- AT THIS POINT MEDI CAL HAS BEEN -- NOT AS WILLING ORGANIZATIONALLY AND I I WOULD SAY A COUPLE CABBIE ODDS WE DO GET MEDI CAL DATA FROM ONE HEALTH PLAN PROMISE HEALTH PLAN -- WE HAVE AS MANY OTHER GENERALLY THEY BE WILLING TO DO THAT THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE CAR ABOUT NATURE OF MANY OF THE PLANS THAT DATA FROM THE SOURCE IS NOT IS COMPARABLE SO IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER TO GET IT DIRECTLY. FROM DH CS SO UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION AND PERFORMANCE FROM DH CS WE HAVEN'T GONE THE DATE ITSELF. AND THAT'S BEEN A FRIENDLY DIALOGUE BUT IT'S JUST IT'S A PROCESS AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THOUGH WE WILL BE HEARING FROM DHS TOWARD THE END OF MY ALASKAN THAT -- TO I WENT OVER ONE YOU WITH THE ANALYSIS I GUESS WHAT I WOULD. LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT WHATEVER I SHOW YOU IS A FORM OF A USE CASE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ONLY. LIMITED TO THE TOPIC THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS MEASURING CHRONIC CARE PERFORMANCE AND THE TAKE AWAYS HERE RATES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN YOU'D WANT IN THE VARIATION IS QUITE HIGH SO -- AVERAGES HIDE A LOT OF TRUTH THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THESE RATES ARE YOU CAN SEE THAT SOME OF THE DIABETES MEASURES ARE ACTUALLY IN THE 50% RANGE ON AVERAGE. OR IF YOU LOOK AT THE VARIATION -- PRETTY WIDE VARIATION AND THIS EXISTS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GEOGRAPHIES OR DIFFERENT HMO PPO OR RISK SHARING ARRANGEMENTS -- I PUT A FEW THE COUNTIES THAT PERFORM WELL ON THAT JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT THERE IS A TREND TOWARD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT ALWAYS AND AGAIN WITHIN ANY COUNTY THERE ARE HIGH PERFORMERS AND LOW PERFORMERS -- COST THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ANALYSIS TO SHARE TOTAL COSTS TO CARE AGAIN INCLUDES -- CLINICAL RISK ADJUSTMENT SO NOT TO GET TOO WALKING ABOUT IT BUT THIS ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT POPULATIONS AND DISEASE SEVERITY. IT ALSO INCLUDES WAGE ADJUSTMENTS SO WE ARE JUST SEEN AS BEST WE CAN FOR WHICH THE DIFFERENTIALS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- PRETTY OBVIOUS TREND IN NORTHERN ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS -- ALSO MUCH MORE VARIATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEN IN SOUTHERN AND THERE'S LOTS OF CONJECTURE ABOUT THIS. US IN THE CALIFORNIA TENDS TO BE BY MOST METRICS MORE COMPETITIVE MARKET -- THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SOME WAYS -- THE DELIVERY MODEL MATTERS HERE I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW INTEGRATED CARE PERFORMS RELATIVE TO NON INTEGRATED CARE -- THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE POWER OF THE COMBINED DATABASE EACH OF THOSE DOT IS A DIFFERENT HEIGHT PA MEDICAL GROUP IN THE STATE THERE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED REPRESENTED. AND THE AVERAGE FOR INTEGRATED CARE ON A DIABETES COMPOSITE IS ABOUT 55% THAT'S FIVE TO SIX MEASURES WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD ON ALL OF THEM TO GET CREDIT SO. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE HOWEVER TAXES LOWER SO WHAT WE SEE IS WHEN YOU START TO COMBINE INTEGRATED AND NON INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS THINGS GET. WORSE THIS INCLUDES THE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS -- THE HIGHEST REGIONAL AVERAGE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE INTEGRATED AVERAGE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP. QUARTILE OF THE INTEGRATED GROUPS IT'S MUCH HIGHER WITH THIS TRANSLATES TO IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY PATIENT CARE IS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE DIABETICS GETTING BETTER AND MORE APPROPRIATE SCREENING. THEN IN INTEGRATED CARE THEN AND NON INTEGRATED CARE AND TIME SECRETARY WHO STILL OKAY. OKAY -- A FEW THINGS TO SAY WHEN WE STANDARDIZE ALL THE MEASURES AND COMPARE HMO PPO. HMO IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER IN TOTAL COST OF CARE A LESS EXPENSIVE SHOULDN'T USE WERE CHEAPER. OF MOST OF THAT IS DUE TO THE MEMBER COST SHARING AND IN OUR IN OUR MINDS THIS IS THE ACTUAL NUMBERS TO GO WITH IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS IT'S TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER. A TWO THREE HIGHER TIMES HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE IN TERMS OF COST SHARING SO MOST OF THE A PRESUMED ADVANTAGE OF SHARON SEEMS TO SHIFT TO THE PATIENTS. LAST THING I'M GOING TO SHARE IN THE NONSTOP -- WE TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS AGAIN THE PLANS ARE REALLY REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF PROVIDING THE DATA AND ACTUALLY PAYING FOR A LOT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE. SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE PRODUCT LABEL HMO PPO TRULY WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHASSIS. SO WE LOOKED AT ACTUALLY -- WHAT TYPES OF NETWORKS ARE PROVIDING UNDER THESE PRODUCT -- PLANS SO WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHETHER -- THE ENROLLEES ARE ACTUALLY IN RISK SITUATIONS CAPITATED SITUATIONS OR NOT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY NO RISK WHICH TEND TO BE MORE PPO BUT NOT ALWAYS. THAT'S A COMPOSITE OF THEIR QUALITY GOING. FROM BOTTOM TO TOP GETS HIGHER WHEN YOU TAKE ON MORE RISK AND GETS EVEN A LITTLE HIGHER WHEN YOU TAKE ON COMPLETE RISKS OF THE FULL BUDGET. FOR OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT CARE COST GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- SO -- WHAT WE HOPE WITH THIS ANALYSIS WE CAN SPLIT A BY PRODUCT LINE IS LET'S LOOK AT SORT OF THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS? OF A OF A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING ASKED TO PURCHASER BEING OFFERED -- AND WHAT DRIVES -- HIGHER VALUE CARE. TIE WILL STOP THERE THE LAST THING. POR STOP THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS AT THE NUMBER OF MEASURES. THAT WE NOW CAN CALCULATE THESE OF THE MEDI CAL VERSUS COMMERCIAL VERSUS MEDICARE AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BEEN A REAL. NICE TRAINED UP FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL DATA WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT SAME GROWTH IN THE MEDI CAL. INFORMATION PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CALCULATING THOSE RATES WE A SUBJECT TO WHAT THE H. YES WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH US. SO I WILL. STOP THEIR FEW THINGS FOR ACTIONS WHICH COME OUT OF OUR WORK [inaudible] TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALRIGHT QUESTIONS REMEMBERS YES CENTER LEYVA. THINK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THE DOCTOR RIGHT OUT FOR YOUR VERY INFORMATIVE -- PRESENTATION HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. HMO AND PPO COSTS AND THE PPO COSTS ARE HIGHER TO THE THE MEMBER THE THE PERSON WHO'S PAYING THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT IS BECAUSE I AM SOMEONE WHO'S HAD AN HMO AND AND HAVE HAD A PPO FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE HMO THOSE KIND OF CONTROL. WHERE YOU CAN GO WHEN YOU CAN GO TO THE DOG WITH THE PPO I CAN I CAN THEORETICALLY GO TO WHOEVER I WANT AND ITS EASE EGGS CALL MAKE THE APPOINTMENT VERSUS HAVING TO HAVE A REFERRAL DO THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE COSTS -- THAT NO DOUBT OCCURS I WILL -- CAUTION EVERYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE THIS IS OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND THIS IS WHAT WE SEE WHAT IS DRIVING THOSE DIFFERENCES IS REALLY FOR POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS -- TO TO ASK AND ANSWER I THINK FROM WHAT WE SEE IN THE DATA. IS LARGELY BASED ON THE COST OF DELIVERING THE CARE FOR ANY MATCH POPULATION AND WHO'S PAYING PART OF THAT SO. IN AN HMO THE CAUTION IS MUCH LOWER THE COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES BY DESIGN MEDI CAL THEIR THEIR NEXT TO NOTHING SO IF YOU USE THE ACTUARIAL TERM THE ACTUARIAL VALUE IS HIGHER IN AN HMO -- WHERE IS IN A PPO MORE THAT IS SHIFTED AND THE PEOPLE THAT THEN IN KERR THOSE COSTS FOR THE ONES THAT YOU SERVICES? GOT IT. THANK YOU. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHEN YOU SAID FINANCIAL RISK SHARING WHAT IS THAT -- IN COMMON TERMS IT'S CAPITATION OKAY -- OR BUDGETED SO BASICALLY PEOPLE TAKING A SET AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF AN ENTIRE POPULATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT POPULATION IS. SICK HEALTHY. SO IT BASICALLY CHANGES THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE FOR THE GROUPS THAT ARE DOING THAT AT THANK YOU WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] QUESTION -- I I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS AND AGAIN I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I THINK IT'S GIVES US A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT -- THIS WERE YOU FORD -- SO FIRST ON TERMS OF YOU KNOW MENTIONED ABOUT INTEGRATE CARED A CIOS RIGHT AND MAYBE THERE'S A DEATH I MEAN THERE DEVELOP DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACS OUT THERE -- WHAT IS? YOUR LOOKING AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET TO THIS OR SO SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS SOMEONE SAYS WILL GRAHAM ACO AND THEY SAID WELL IT'S IT'S ABOUT MULTIPLE DISEASES ARE ACTUALLY SO POPULATION RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES YOU'LL SAY WELL TODAY CO SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR CHRONIC DISEASE BECAUSE ACTUALLY YOU COULD IMPROVE YOUR DIABETES CARE BUT IF DAVIESS LUMPED IN WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER DISEASES IT'S HARD TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ONE SO. I DON'T KNOW FROM THE OTHER YOU HAD SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IF IT IF WE'RE TRYING TO TRY TO TACKLE -- YOU KNOW IT -- COME OF VALUE BASED SYSTEMS THESE GROUPS VERSES POT YEAH JUST JUMP POPULATION AND WHEN IT COMES TO CHRONIC DISEASE A MAGAZINE PREVENTION STANDPOINT YOU WANTED. TO TACKLE WHOLE POPULATION. BUT FROM A YOU KNOW CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT IS IT IN TERMS OF FOR WRITING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES. DIAZ SAY OKAY WE'LL GIVE YOU A SET AMOUNT FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT FOR YOUR POOL OF DIABETICS AND THEN WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE FOR LET'S SAY ASTHMA OR SOME OTHER CHRONIC DISEASE VERSUS A WILL GIVE ME AN ACL IT EVERYTHING'S LUMPED TOGETHER -- SO. BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WHAT SOMETHING'S MAY ACTUALLY CREATE CHANGES ACROSS MULTIPLE CHRONIC DISEASES A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE DOING YOUR YOU'RE CREATING PROCESS IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RELIEF. PARTICULAR TAYLOR TOWARD ONE PARTICULAR. ONE AND SO I DON'T KNOW YOU ARE A COMMON OF THAT A PARTICULAR MY AT LET AND ALSO THE EXISTING MODELS THAT WOULD INDICATE WHICH WAY IS THE BETTER WAY TO GO. SOMETHING CO A SORRY ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION SO THAT YEAH IT IS AS SAYING THAT THE COUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION DIED CONCEPT IS IS THAT'S A SURE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU WOULD GIVE A FIX THE ACE SOMEWHAT FIXED AMOUNT FOR CARING FOR PATIENTS AS A PARTICULAR CONDITION. RIGHT AND THEY'RE FOR DIRTY SO CALLED SHARED SAVINGS OF YOU ACTUALLY SO THAT THE DOCTOR IN THE HOSPITAL THE PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALL THAT DEPENDING WHAT'S ALL LUMPED UNDER THE AC ON BELLA. YEAH BASICALLY YOU MANAGE THEM OUT MONEY WE ACTUALLY END UP SPENDING MORE YOU LOSE MONEY IF USE. DO IT FOR LESS YOU ACTUALLY GET TO KEEP THE SAVINGS ARE SOME SORT OF SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS THOSE CALL OFTENTIMES IT'S CULTURED STATING SO GIVES AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE. TO IF YOU ACTUALLY LOWER THE COST OF CARE BY APPROVING IT OUT THAT THE COST EFFICIENCY YOU ACTUALLY GET TO KEEP SOME OF THAT MONEY SO YEAH THAT'S THE INCENTIVE TO TO TRIP IT'S NOT OVER SIMPLIFYING THINGS -- A SEALS ARE LARGELY A MARKETING TERM IN A BRAND AND A BRANDING TERM -- WHAT IT WHAT IN A CO IS EVEN IN THIS DISCUSSION IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY? COMPLICATED AND OUR WORK ACTUALLY SHOWS THERE ARE NINE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE GET PAID UNDER A CEOS ARE EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS TO ATTRIBUTE PATIENTS TO IN A CO IN CALIFORNIA. SO I I THINK I WOULD SAY WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THE LOCUS OF CARE DELIVERY AND WHETHER THAT CARE DELIVERY SITE IS INTEGRATED OR NOT SO -- INTEGRATED CARE TENDS TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SPECIAL FOR CHRONIC CARE WHATEVER GETS LABELED IS ALMOST SECONDARY AND IF YOU CAN TOLERATE ONE MORE SLIDE WE DID. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE THANK YOU USE USE THE USE OF YOUR SLIDE -- YEAH I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD ONES WE YOU KNOW WE CAN SPEND ALL DAY SO THIS IS THE THE CURVE A SHOWED YOU ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK AND AGAIN. ALL ON ATTRIBUTE TO DELORES ON THIS WE ASK FOR ANY CO FLAG SO WE ACTUALLY IN OUR DATABASE CAN KNOW WHO'S IN ANY CO HAS A HEALTH PLAN WOODS WOULD WOULD SELF REPORT. THIS IS WHERE THEY LAND RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AND NOTHING ON A IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS MAYBE THE HIGHEST END OF THE INTEGRATED GROUPS AND WE'RE UPDATING THAT INFORMATION NOW -- SO WE'LL HAVE MORE UPDATES BUT I GUESS THE MAIN POINT IS WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THIS AND WE'RE NOW ASKING THOSE HARDERQUESTIONS ABOUT. WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD. THANK YOU THAT SAID IT'S VERY INTERESTING I THINK IT WILL -- I GUESS THE OTHER. QUESTION I WAS HAVING IS IS THAT -- THAT IS SO I AND I GUESS UNDER MEDICARE CARED VANTAGE -- THERE -- DOING SOME PAYMENT MODELS AND AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CAPITATION RATE SO OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT SHOULD AT LEAST AT THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE -- PEOPLE PAYING PREMIUMS INTO THOSE WE WE DON'T WANT CHARTER BASICALLY WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO CHARGE DIFFERENT PREMIUMS TO PEOPLE BASED ON THE CONDITION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCRIMINATION BUT CLEARLY. PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS THEY HAVE WILL COST DIFFERENTLY -- SO IN TERMS. SAYS SOMEONE THINGS WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE AVOID THIS. ADVERSE SELECTION PROBLEM RIGHT AND AND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE A CEOS -- THEY'VE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GIVE PAYMENT BASED ON AT LEAST SOME ESTIMATION WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY CREATORS COST SAVINGS THROUGH. WITH IT AND CARE INNOVATION AND SO FORTH. WE DID YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON HOW WE MIGHT TRY IT IT'S FROM LOOKING AT THIS DATA. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT INTEGRATED MODELS IS THERE? IN TERMS OF THEIR PAYMENT MECHANISMS -- MATTER DDC PARTICULAR MODELS THAT THAT SEEM TO SHOW THE MORE PROMISE IN THAT REGARD. YES -- WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME BUT THE THE TREND INFORMATION ON COMMERCIAL IS PERFECTLY NEARED IN MEDICARE -- MEDICARE VERSUS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE -- SO AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART IS ON THE CLINICAL MEASURES FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. GROUP VANTAGE POPULATION SO -- AND I THE INCENTIVES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK -- OR THE STAR SYSTEM SO BASICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE STARS SYSTEM AS A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT THAT HAS. BOTH -- INCENTIVE DOLLARS TO IT AND PENALTIES FOR UNDER PERFORMANCE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY BUILT ON THIS KIND OF DATA -- THAT CMS AND GENERATE. ENOUGH FINALLY EXIT -- AND I LOOKING FOR EXPLORING SOME OF THESE THINGS ALSO THEIR FUTURE BUT THEIR NECKS PANELS TO BUT THE OTHER THING ACTUALLY I JUST -- MAKENOTE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE WE NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW -- THE DARTMOUTH ATLAS FOLKS HAD ACTUALLY DID A STUDY MAYBE ABOUT TEN THINKS ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND THEY ACTUALLY LOOKED AT END OF LIFE CARE AND THEY DID JUST LOOK AT MEDICARE DATA BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD WORKING WITH THEM. AND ACTUALLY MADE NOTE THAT -- UTILIZATION FOR END OF LIFE CARE -- SO -- I DON'T KNOW IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME OR IS IT JUST THAT AND THAT THEY ALSO NOTED THAT. SORT OF PRICE PER UNIT WAS HIGHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO PRICE PER UNIT SERVICE. BUT THAT BUT THE ACTUAL BUT THE UTILIZATION ACTUALLY WAS HIGHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY ACTUALLY TREATED POTENTIALLY TOWARD ACTUALLY. YOU SAID MORE YELTSIN'S MORE COMPETITION BUT THE ACTUALLY THE HAVING MORE SPECIALISTS AND HAVING MORE ICE YOU BEDS AVAILABLE MEANT THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN ONE WHICH WAS MORE INTENSIVE. SO I KNOW WHETHER YOU -- YOU HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLORE -- THAT WHETHER THERE'S A BEEN A SECULAR TREND SINCE THAT STUDY WAS DONE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE LITTLE COUNTER TO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW WITH THE DAY THAT YOU HAVE -- I'D SAY I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE DATA I THINK THAT IS A DIFFERENT PHENOMENON. ARE COMPARISONS ARE LARGELY COMMERCIAL POPULATION SO THAT WE CAN DO MEDICARE. AND AND THEY ARE CLINICALLY RISK ADJUSTED SO PRESUMABLY UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THIS THE POPULATIONS ARE MATCHED -- THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH SEEM TO BE -- RELATED -- TO UNIT PRICING -- AND THAT SAID IN DETAIL BY DOCTOR SHUFFLER ANOTHER SAID AT BERKELEY -- NOT UTILIZATION DIFFERENT. AND THE BIGGEST ONE LAST SUMMER TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT GIVES YOUR TO DATE A GUY YOU'RE DOING THE AND ATLAS -- WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT ONE THE HOLY GRAIL SAYS RISK BASE PREMIUM PAYMENT RIGHT WHETHER IT'S PREMIUMS ARE POOL AND REDISTRIBUTION OR SOME KIND OF -- HIGH RISK POOL OR SOMETHING. D. AS IS THE DATA TECHNOLOGY THERE YET IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY DOING RISK BASED PAYMENTS OF BASICALLY ADJUSTING THE PAYMENT. TO BUT IS HEALTH PLANS OTHER RISK BEARING ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON THE RISK OF THE POPULATION CAN WE DO THAT ACTUALLY ENOUGH SO THAT PEOPLE CAN'T OVERLY GAME THE SYSTEM. AND THEN PROVIDE THIS KIND OF SENTENCE TO TAKE ON MORE PEOPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS -- IS IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT REALLY QUITE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THAT. SO THE THE WAY AN ANSWER I DON'T THINK THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY FIX I I THINK THE THE PROBLEMS ARE VERY VERY CLEAR AND TAKE A FAIRLY SIMPLE STEPS TOWARD GETTING PEOPLE INTO INTEGRATED SYSTEMS -- I REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN THERE IS RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION. REALLY COMPLICATED REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN I THINK BASICALLY THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO SHORT OF THAT KIND OF R. A. I. R. MACHINE LEARNING KIND OF ENVIRONMENT -- AND MOST OF IT IS AVAILABLE THE DATA THAT WE WE LOOK AT NOW. RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. OKAY SO NEXT UP -- SO THANK YOU AGAIN BACKED RIGHT OUT SO NEXT UP WE HAVE. A PANEL ON NOT CONTRACT STRATEGIES IMPROVE CHRONIC DISEASE CARE AND AND REALLY APPRECIATE WE GET -- DOUG MCKEEVER -- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR PROGRAMS COVERED CALIFORNIA -- WITH KATHY DONNA SEND A CHIEF HEALTH PLAN ADMINISTRATION DIVISION CALPERS. AND BILL KRAMER EXECUTOR IS DOING ON BEHALF OF OUR ARE -- GOVERNMENT NOW STATE AND THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AS WELL TO RECAP FOR SYSTEM AND OF COURSE REPEAT BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE SO WE'LL START WITH THAT MISS RICKY VERNAL. AND SO THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DOUG MCGEE EVER COVER CALIFORNIA. AND GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO DEMONSTRATE AND COMMUNICATE TO YOU HOW WE'RE GONNA PROVE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND SIX MINUTES OR LESS -- TO T. OUT MY COMMENTS TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF CONTEXT ON COVER CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SEVERAL MAIN AREAS WE FOCUS ON CLEARLY AFFORDABILITY IS. ONE ACCESS QUALITY AND THE OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM. OUR GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE OUR ENROLLMENT. AND HAVE AN OVERALL HEALTHY RISK MIX. FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA THIS IS RESULT IN US HAVING A STABLE ENROLLMENT. AND ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST ENROLLMENT POPULATIONS IN THE COUNTRY. ON AVERAGE ARE CONSUMERS ARE 20% HEALTHIER THAN THOSE ENROLLED IN THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE IS. IN OTHER STATES. UNDERLYING ALL THIS IS HOW MANY STABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM. ONE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT CARE. AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLABORATE IN A LINE WITH OTHER PURCHASERS AND THAT'S FROM THE SPEND MOST OF MY TIME THIS AFTERNOON. AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED ATTACHMENT. SEVEN WHICH PLACES CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS ON ARE QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS. AND THEIR PROVIDERS. THERE ARE NINE MEAN ARTICLES WITH A HOST OF SUB ARTICLES WITHIN EACH ONE OF THOSE. RANGING FROM IMPROVING CARE. PROMOTING BETTER HEALTH AND LOWERING COSTS. PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF EFFECTIVE CARE MODELS. REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INSURING HEALTH EQUITY. AND PAYMENT INCENTIVES TO PROMOTE HIGHER VALUE CARE. SOME OF THE RESULTS WE ARE SEEN MOSTLY FROM THE TO THESE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN PLAN YEAR ARE. VETERAN NATIONAL ANALYSIS SHOW THAT HEALTH PLANS WORKING WITH THEIR NETWORK PROVIDERS HAVE MADE STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY. CONSUMERS ARE GETTING THAT QUALITY CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARD REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ARE THE GLOBAL QUALITY RATINGS ON THE STAR RATING SYSTEMS A DOCTOR RIGHT OUT POINTED OUT. WHERE ALL OF OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE AT LEAST THREE STARS AND TWO OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY AT? FIVE QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS OF SHOWN STEADY IMPROVEMENT. OVER THREE YEARS FOR IMPORTANT MEASURES INCLUDING H. P. A. ONE C. LEVELS. DIABETIC MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENINGS. AS OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN SIX OF OUR ISSUERS HAD IMPLEMENTED VALUE BASED PAYMENTS FOR HOSPITALS. THESE HOSPITAL VALUE BASED PAYMENTS PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR INSURERS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT. THAT 2% OF HOSPITAL PAYMENTS FOR EACH IN NETWORK HOSPITAL IS TIED TO VALUE. AS OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN MOST HEALTH PLANS HAD ACTIVELY RE CONTRACTED FOR PAYMENTS. FOR LOW RISK OF C. SECTIONS. WHILE THE REMAINING HELP PLANTS HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS. RATES OF LOW RISK SEE SECTIONS FOR FIRST TIME PREGNANCIES ARE STEADILY COMING DOWN. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ALMOST FORTY FIVE HUNDRED UNNECESSARY SEE SECTIONS. WERE AVOIDED STATEWIDE. HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN PARTNERSHIP FOR PATIENTS IMPROVEMENT COLLABORATIVE'S. IS NOW NORMALLY UNIVERSAL. A REFLECTION OF THE COLLABORATION THROUGH SMART CARE AND THE EFFORTS THAT WE COLLABORATED WITH WITH DH CS CALPERS. IN PGH. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN VIRTUALLY ALL 99% OF COVER CALIFORNIAN ROWLEY'S OF WHICH THERE ARE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. WERE MATCHED WITH THE PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS. SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE TO THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. ENROLLMENT IN PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN ENROLLMENT IN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE MODELS FOR THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION SAID DR RIGHT OUT SPOKE OF FOR OUR HEALTH PLANS WITH BOTH. E. IN PPO NETWORKS. 99% OF ENROLLEES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WERE OFFERED TELEHEALTH SERVICES. 58% WERE OFFERED PRIMARY CARE TELEHEALTH VISITS AT THE SAME COST OF A PRIMARY CARE VISIT. AND 41% WERE OFFERED PRIMARY CARE TELEHEALTH VISITS AT NO COST SHARE. WHILE THESE DATA POINTS ARE ENCOURAGING WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITIES TO MAKE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MORE AFFORDABLE. ACCESSIBLE AND INCREASE QUALITY. TO THAT END WE HAVE EMBARKED UPON AN EFFORT OF REFRESHING OUR CONTRACTUAL EXPECTATIONS. DESIGNED TO PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELIVERY SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES ARE IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION. THE EXPERIENCE OF CARE. REDUCING THE COST OF CARE. REDUCING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. AND REDUCING HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES. PROMOTING ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER PURCHASERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ALIGNING PAYMENT WITH PROVEN DELIVERY MODELS. AND FOCUSING MORE ON OUTCOMES RATHER THAN PROCESS SEES. TO INFORM OUR EFFORTS WE HAVE ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS. FOR THE FOLLOWING WE ARE IDENTIFYING RELEVANT BENCHMARKS. AND DATA SOURCES FOR VALID COMPARISON POINTS FOR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. WE'RE REVIEWING OTHER LARGE PURCHASER EFFORTS. TO IDENTIFY KEY AREAS OF FOCUS. STRATEGIES FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER FOR ADOPTION AND OR ALIGNMENT. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH VALUE ENHANCE STRATEGY. AND EVALUATE ITS POTENTIAL AFFECTED MISS IN TERMS OF COST QUALITY OF CARE. IMPROVED HEALTH HEALTH OUTCOMES. NOW WE'RE GONNA BE SOME RISE IN THOSE FINAL -- THESE FINDINGS BY APRIL AND TAKEN TO OR BOARD LATER THIS YEAR FOR HOPEFULLY THEIR APPROVAL AS WE MOVE INTO OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE CONTRACT YEAR. FINALLY ON THE AREA OF COLLABORATION -- AS YOU CAN SEE WE KNOW DOCTOR RIGHT OUT WELL WE'RE PART OF THE I. T. BOARD WE KNOW BILL WELL PART OF P. BGH. CLEARLY WE WORK A LOT WITH KATHY DONNA SEND -- AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT EFFORT IT'S EXTREME IT WHERE WE CAN ALIGN OUR EFFORTS. TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON THOSE PROVIDERS THAT WE ALL CONTRACT WITH. AND THAT'S OUR INTENTION MOVING FORWARD IN OUR PROCESS SEES -- IN HOPES OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE COME UP WITH OUR REFRESH EFFORTS ON ATTACHMENT. SEVEN IS TO ALIGN THOSE EFFORTS WITH OTHERS AND UTILIZE EXISTING MEASURE SETS ARE OU THERE SO THAT WE DON'T OVER BURDEN THE HEALTH CARE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ALL SERVE. COM AS A REMINDER THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE DETAIL THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE. AND INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED -- AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF OUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER ANDERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON KATHY DONNA SIN CHIEF FOR THE HEALTH PLAN ADMINISTRATION DIVISION -- WE AREN'T WE PURCHASE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF MEMBERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT. THE US AND IN OUR P. PO'S THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE ALSO -- FROM PURCHASE A BENEFITS FOR TWELVE HUNDRED CONTRACTING AGENCIES AND SCHOOLS. AND WE PURCHASED FOR DEPEND -- OTHER MEMBERS. THESE ARE THE HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO WE HAVE SEVENTY TWO MILES AND AND THREE PP OWES AND WE ARE SELF FUNDED FOR OUR FOR PROVIDER ORGANIZATION PLANS. AND TODAY I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW CALPERS WORKS WITH ITS PLANS TO ITS CONTRACTS IN ITS PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING QUALITY FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND. THESE ARE ACTUAL SECTIONS FROM OUR CONTRACT A WE HAVE FIVE YEAR CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THREE HOWEVER WE JUST COMPLETED OUR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN CONTRACTS AND WITHIN THOSE CONTRACTS WE HAVE STANDARDIZED ALL OF OUR BENEFITS -- FOR PPO AN HMO THAT CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. AND THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES IN THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT CHRONIC CONDITIONS MANAGEMENT DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PHARMACY PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY A PORTION OF OUR PREMIUM THAT EACH MEMBER PAYS SUPPORTS WELLNESS OF PROGRAMS PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND WE ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN TERMS OF ZERO COPAYS FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES. ON USPS TASK FORCE LIST. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE A DATA POINTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE DEVELOPED A POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH -- TO TAKING CARE OF OUR MEMBERS -- AND WE HAVE A DATA WAREHOUSE WHICH CAPTURES THE DATA THAT WE USE TO LOOK AT OUR PREVALENCE THIS IS A PREVALENCE. CHART FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS ON THAT DASHBOARD FOR EXAMPLE ASTHMA CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE DEPRESSION. HYPERTENSION DIABETES AND THERE ARE OTHERS BUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THOSE THAT WE WHICH WE THINK ARE OF INTEREST IN OUR TRACKING TEA FOR YOU. THIS IS A PPO PREVALENCE FOR THE SAME CONDITIONS FOR THE SAME YEARS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO CURE 200-015-22000 AND SEVENTEEN AND YOU CAN SEE. THAT FOR THE PREVALENCE OVER THOSE THREE YEARS IN BOTH CATEGORIES WE ARE SEEING A REDUCTION WE DO FIND THAT ARE OR PPO PLANS ARE HIGHER IN TERMS OF PREVALENCE AS A RESULT OF DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THOSE PLANS IN IN OUR CARE PRODUCT THERE IS AN OLDER POPULATION. WE ALSO TRACK HE JUST MEASURES THIS IS THESE ARE FEW THE HE JUST MEASURES THAT WE TRACK AND WE HAVE A PAPER FOR PAY. FOR PERFORMANCE FOR HEALTH PLANS DO IT HERE IN REACH BENCHMARKS OR AT LEAST REACH TARGETS WITHIN -- THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT PERIOD. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FOR HMO SWITCHER DISPLAYED HERE -- THAT WE HAVE -- THEY ARE AT LEAST MEDIAN AND IN MANY INSTANCES EXCEEDING THE BENCHMARKS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S WE TRACK WHAT I HAVE HERE IS CHILDREN WITH UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION HE MICHAEL OF ANYONE SEE. TESTING RATES. OUR USE OF STUDIES FOR LOW BACK PAIN AND REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT IN THESE MEASURES HIGHER IS BETTER SO YOU CAN SEE THE BENCHMARKS FOR THE H. MILES. AND YOU CAN SEE THE BENCH MARKS OF FOR THE P. PO'S AS WELL SO WE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED OUR OVERSIGHT AND OUR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THE PLANS THAT WE MONITOR. NOW OVER THE PERIOD OF BOTH THE LAST FIVE YEAR CONTRACT IN THIS NEW CONTRACT WE HAVE LEARNED TWO THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE TO THIS COMMITTEE. OUR MEMBERS VALUE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. AND WE ARE GETTING BETTER COMPLIANCE WHEN OUR MEMBERS ARE AFFILIATED WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. AND ENGAGE WITH THAT PROVIDER IN TERMS OF EARLY DETECTION A CHECK UPS ANNUAL PHYSICALS AND MEDICATION ADHERENCE. THE SECOND THING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT OUR MEMBERS IN ORDER. ARE OF ARE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIANS WITH THE NETWORK OVERLAP WITH WHICH EXISTS WITHIN OUR H. AMOUNTS. AND ALSO FOR OUR P. PO'S -- ITCHING IN IN SERVE THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION WAY THAT JEFF AND DOUG DESCRIBED THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. WE BELIEVE THAT COMPETITION OFFERS OUR MEMBERS PLAN CHOICE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE PREMIUM COMPETITION AND AS WELL AS WITH THAT NETWORK OVERLAP. TO KEEP THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SHOULD A HMO PLAN. WITHDRAW FROM AN AREA OR FOR SOME OF THE RECENT SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE BOTH IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINE MISTER KRAMER [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK AND SEND PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT -- LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED ARE WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERS AT PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. BY NAME IS BILL KRAMER I'M EXECUTIVE RECTOR FOR HEALTH POLICY AT P. BGH. OR BRIEFLY -- FOR THOSE WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH P. BGH -- WE'RE CONSISTENT ABOUT. SIXTY A LARGE EMPLOYER MEMBERS INCLUDING CALPERS COVER CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS MANY -- A PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS -- MANY OF THEM BASED IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF LARGE EMPLOYERS TO COVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SO WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN MULTIPLE MARKETS. WE ARE NOT FOR PROFIT A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC BENEFIT ORGANIZATION. WE'RE NOT A TRADE ASSOCIATION -- OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WIDE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OUR MISSION IS SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENT. WE ARE ENGAGE IN THREE CORE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN VALUE -- ONE IS WE HAVE A TRUMP ARE THE LARGEST PART OF OUR STAFF. CAGED IN CARE REDESIGNED WORKING DIRECTLY WITH PHYSICIANS PHYSICIAN GROUPS HOSPITALS NOT HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO RECRUIT A QUALITY OF CARE -- WE ALSO -- EMPHASIZE PAYMENT REFORM MOVING AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE PAYMENT MODELS TOWARD VALUE BASED PAYMENT MODELS WHETHER TO PAY FOR PERFORMANCE BUILT ON FEE FOR SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE OR MOVING TOWARD. A GREATER TO RESERVE SHARED RISK ALL THE WAY TO CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS. AND WE HAVE A POLICY COMPONENT -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR SYSTEM WHY CHANGE THAT CAN HAPPEN -- WHILE WE CAN INNOVATE AS PRIVATE SECTOR PURCHASERS -- TEMPORE NHÍP PUBLIC PURCHASERS WHETHER IT'S THE STATE MEDI CAL PLANNED A STATE EMPLOYEE PLAN -- OR CREEK THE NATIONAL LEVEL MEDICARE. TO WE BELIEVE THE INNOVATIONS WE SHARED -- CAN BE HELPFUL TO POLICY MAKERS THAT'S THE GIST OF OUR POLICY WORK -- WE'D WHAT THE COMMITTEES INTEREST IN -- IMPROVING CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS THIS THIS IS WE ARE GREATLY WARRANTED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT -- THE EIGHT PEOPLE MOP OF CRIME CONDITIONS ENCOURAGE ARE. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COSTS AMONG LARGE EMPLOYERS WE ESTIMATE THAT 40%. OF A TYPICAL LARGE EMPLOYERS TOTAL COST OF CARE. FOR OF THE TERMS OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS USING KERR BY ABOUT 15% OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COST -- THE QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS IS OFTEN SUB STANDARD. BY THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE IS OFF -- WE KNOW THAT TRADITIONAL BENEFIT DESIGNS PARTICULARLY SIMPLE A DEDUCTIBLE PLANS ARE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS OFTEN CREATE A FINANCIAL BARRIER TO PATIENTS MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AND THAT THE SERVICES NEEDED BY PATIENTS MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS ARE OFTEN NOT COMPATIBLE WITH TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDER PAYMENTS. TWO POINT SEPARATE SIZE -- IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FOUND IN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT PRIMARY CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPROVING OF CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS -- ADVANCED PRIMARY CARE MODELS -- WE BELIEVE GOD CAN AND SHOULD BE SPREAD MORE BROADLY AND COULD BE A COULD AND SHOULD BE THE FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE -- AND IMPROVE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND TOTAL COST. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BEHAVIOR HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH INTEGRATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. TOO MANY TIMES -- THE THE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE BENEFIT DESIGN IS CARVED OUT -- AND THAT IS TO THE DETRIMENT OF BELIEVE OF MOST PATIENTS -- AND IT'S WRITTEN TOTAL TO THE QUALITY OF CARE CATION EXPERIENCE AND TOTAL COST OF CARE. IT'S TOUGH BUT WE HAVE SEEN SUCCESSFUL MODELS AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE GOOD. I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE. ONE BGH PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING THE CARE FOR PEOPLE POSSIBLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE IN PATIENT CHART. MISSPOKE INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT CARE PROGRAM OR HIGH -- CP. I CAN I SEE YOU BUT IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING -- THIS WAS LAUNCHED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN THE SEATTLE AREA BY ONE OF OUR MEMBERS POLLING -- IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SPREAD -- TO SOME PILOTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SUBSEQUENTLY WE HAD GOT A CONTRACT FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE INNOVATION CMMI. TO TO SPREAD IT. TOO CARE PRACTICES IN FIVE WESTERN STATES. BRIEFLY IT'S A PRIMARY CARE BASED MODEL. PAY AN UPFRONT CARE COORDINATION FEE. ARE AND WE HAVE A ROBUST SET OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND OUR TO TO TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THEIR PEOPLE GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED NEED ONLY PROVIDE THE CLINICAL TRAINING TO HELP -- MEDICAL GROUPS AND THEIR CARE TEAMS -- TO DO THIS. BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL -- IT HAS IMPROVED THE OUTCOMES OF CARE AT SOME THE UNNECESSARY -- AND FIVE VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATIONS A RESULT FROM A CRASH BECAUSE OF POORLY COORDINATED KERR -- IT'S IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE HIGH SO IT'S MIGHT BE PEOPLE ADD A SUBJECT WE PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS. BOB. THERE ARE TWO SETS A RECOMMENDATION TO LIKE TO SHARE AND AGAIN I'LL PROVIDE THIS MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN FOR AND FORM TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF YOU -- AND ALSO ANY IN FOLLOW UP INFORMATION YOU MIGHT NEED. BUT FOR PURCHASERS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS [inaudible] BOB. GREEN WITH A DOG AND CAT HE SAID ALIGNMENT BETWEEN WHAT PRIVATE SECTOR PURCHASERS IN PAIRS ARE DOING WITH PUBLIC SECTOR PURCHASERS IN PAIRS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO BE USING CONSISTENT -- MEASURES PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONSISTENT PAYMENT MODELS. ARE CONSISTENT QUALITY STANDARDS SO THAT. PROVIDERS BUT THE DOCTORS THE HOSPITALS. OR PROVIDING THE BEST CARE AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT CARE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PERSON IS MEDI CAL RECIPIENT OF THEIR COVERED BY CALPERS. COVER CALIFORNIA PLAN OR ONE OF COMMERCIAL PAYERS -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE USE OF MEANINGFUL MEASURES IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND TRADITIONAL. CHECK THE BOX KIND OF MEASURES TWO WERE ACTUALLY MEASURING CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND IDEALLY PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES -- WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO -- BUT WE I THINK THAT -- THEY'RE GOING AND NATIONALLY BUT WE HAVE A FOR TO WORK WE CAN DO TOGETHER. WE NEED TO PURSUE ADVANCE PAYMENT MODELS -- DOUG AND I WERE TALKING EARLIER THAT THERE. SEEMS TO BE UP THE DOLLARS MUCH PROGRESS IN MOVING TOWARD AWAY FOR MOVING AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE. TOWARD TOWARD VALUE BASED PAYMENT MODELS IN WHICH PROVIDERS REWARDED FOR DELIVERING GOOD QUALITY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT -- SO THAT'S THAT'S A LAMP ISSUES -- SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PURCHASERS STUFF WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS BUT WE HAVE STILL MORE WORK TO DO AND AND PARTICULARLY TO ALIGN THE WORK OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS. FUNNY FOR POLICY MAKERS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT WAYS TO STRENGTHEN PRIMARY CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OTHER STATES HAVE ACTUALLY SET TARGETS FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AMAT FIRST MONITORING AND THEN SETTING TARGETS. FOR INCREASE PRIMARY CARE SPENDING -- SECOND THING COURAGE YOU -- TO PUT -- SUPPORT THE WORK THAT PUBLIC SECTOR PURCHASERS TO GREAT CALPERS MEDICARE CALAR DOING. OF TO MOVE TOWARD VALUE BASED PAYMENT -- THERE'S TICKETS. HONORED TO IT'S COMPLICATED AND IT'S HARD. UNDERSUPPLY WAS PUSHED BACK FROM A PROVIDER'S BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION -- BECAUSE DELIVERY MALLS ADVANCED CARE DELIVERY MODELS -- WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF OUR WORK THROUGH FOUNDATIONS. SUPPORT FROM CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND OTHERS -- BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN NEEDS TO BE DONE PARTICULARLY SMALLER INDEPENDENT PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES. STATE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES FOR CARE DELIVERY Mà DANCE CARE DELIVERY MODELS THE STATE COULD PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT AND WOULD PAY BACK -- IN ARTS FOR THE BETTER FOR THE OF THE ENTIRE ALL EVERYONE IN THE STATE. AND FINALLY TO DEVELOP -- A WORK FORCE -- THAT IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS -- ENCOURAGED TO TO LOOK AT SCOPE OF PRACTICE LAWS -- TO ENABLE PEOPLE -- TO PROFESSIONALS TO WORK AT THE TOP OF THEIR LICENSE TO BE PART OF AN EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY TEAM WE FOUND THAT. IN OUR WORK THE CARE -- CARE TEAMS -- I HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE IT'S IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND I THINK THERE'S MUCH TO STAY COULD COULD DO. TO ADVANCE TO CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS. WELL CERTAINLY -- TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOUSE SUPPORT ADVANCED CARE DELIVERY MODELS AS PART THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING BUT QUESTIONS. MEANNESS YES SIR LEYVA AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK% YOU ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I CAN NEVER LET AN OPPORTUNITY PASS WITHOUT THINKING COVERED CALIFORNIA -- FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE ACA I THINK THAT IT IS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. AND WE HEAR SO MUCH NEGATIVITY ABOUT THE ACA AND FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND HELP NEGOTIATE BENEFITS FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR WORKERS. I REALLY ONLY KNEW PEOPLE WHO HAD HEALTH CARE. AND WE BECAME NAVIGATORS AT MY LOCAL UNION AND SO WE SIGNED UP FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ON COVER CALIFORNIA. AND TO SEE THE STARK DIFFERENCE WHO HAD ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND PEOPLE WHO WALK THROUGH OUR DOORS AND HADN'T SEEN A DOCTOR IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. IT WAS -- IT WAS LIFE CHANGING SO APPRECIATE WHAT CAL A COVER CALIFORNIA'S DOING AND I THINK THAT ALL OF US SHOULD MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIGHT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN'T DO IN LIFE SO THANK YOU. MS DAWSON I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHO NEGOTIATES YOU YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION I THINK YOU SAID -- THE AND AND OTHERS WHO DOES YOUR NEGOTIATIONS FOR RATE INCREASES. WE HAVE AN ENTIRE TEAM THAT NEGOTIATES THE THE PREMIUM SEE CHAIR OKAY. AND THEY THEY USE THE DATA WAREHOUSE WE USE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTUARIES WE REALLY HELPFUL TRANSPARENCY BOTH FROM THE DATA WAREHOUSE AND FROM THE WAYS WE PAY OUR OUR PLANS NOW WEEK WE COLLECT THE PREMIUM. AND THEN WE PAY OUT TO THE PLAN'S COMPONENTS OF THAT PREMIUM. AND THEN THE STATE COMPTROLLER OFFICE OF PAYS OUT THE FEE FOR SERVICE CLAIMS FOR ANY OF THOSE PLANS IT AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE. AVERAGE -- THAT BENEFITS THAT FOLKS ARE PAYING HOW MUCH IS GOING UP EACH YEAR. WELL WE JUST THE ON NEGOTIATED TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN THE AGGREGATE NOT INCLUDES SAW EVERYTHING MEDICARE COMMERCIAL OF PPO HMO WAS ONE POINT 16% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS A AND WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE 2% AND THEN THAT PRIOR YEAR FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS RIGHT AROUND 3%. AND I WILL SAY WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD BETWEEN THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE PREMIUMS AND THE NEGOTIATING TEAM FOR THE CONTRACTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY HOLDING OUR PLANS LIKE NOT JUST FOR THE CHRONIC CONDITIONS MANAGEMENT THAT I I TALKED ABOUT BUT OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURED MEASURES RELATED -- TO INFLATIONARY CAPS THAT ARE ALSO WRITTEN IN TO OUR CONTRACTS SO IF SOMEONE WHO HAD ANTHEM BLUE CROSS -- HAD A 100% INCREASE IN THEIR% PREMIUM THAT WOULD BE UNUSUAL. YES OKAY I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT PERSON OFF LINE ART THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. RIGHT CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT DAM SEVENTY IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION BUT I'M NOTICING THAT AND I BELIEVE DOCTOR I'M SORRY I MISSED MORE YOU. MENTIONED THE MENTAL HEALTH INTEGRATION CONTINUES TO BE LACKING IN. A NOTICE IN THE CHARTS THAT MISSED HONEST AND PROVIDED DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO BE SORT OF STEADY LIKE ALL THE OTHER CATEGORIES ASK MOTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS WENT DOWN. BUT DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO BE PRETTY STUDY I'VE NOTICED I CAN YOU SPEAK MORE TO THAT. IN PARTICULAR. YES I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPRESSION YES BUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- IN AS A GENERAL CATEGORY WE DO NEED DOING WE CALPERS COVERED CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE MEDI CAL TO WE NEED TO DO MORE AND APPROACHING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE SERVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN ARE PPO SO YOU'VE GOT. COUNTIES IN THE FAR NORTH IN THESE REMOTE REGIONS WE THINK THERE IS SOME PROMISE ESPECIALLY FOR SOMETHING LIKE DEPRESSION THAT COULD IN THE FUTURE. COME FROM TELEHEALTH -- WE HAVE REDESIGNED OUR PURSE SELECT PRODUCTS SO THAT EIGHT A VISIT TO A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALIST. IS THE SAME AS A VISIT TO A PRIMARY CARE COPAYS UNDER THAT NEW DESIGN FOR PERSONAL ACT. SO THAT WE REDUCED -- OUR P. P. R. P. PO'S MEMBERS WHO WILL IDENTIFY WITH A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SIMILAR TO AN HMO. IF THEY WILL DO THAT AND HAVE THAT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THAN THAT COPAYS GONE DOWN FROM TWENTY DOLLARS TO TEN DOLLARS AND THAT ALSO IS -- FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO INTRODUCE THE VALUE PROPOSITIONS. INTO ARE PPO PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE FULLY AT RISK FOR WERE FULLY SELF FUNDED. SO THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE IN HMO LIKE APPROACH IN TERMS OF CARE MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. HI I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF THE U. -- A LOT OF INTERESTING -- ISSUES -- GETS WHAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION FIRST ON THE CALPERS ON THE PREVALENCE RATES WHICH ARE DECLARED AS WAS MENTIONED BY SIR RUBIO. MANY OF MORE DECLINING. IS IS THAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE CLIENT IS A CHANGE IN THE POPULATION YOU'RE COVERING OURS THIS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT -- YOU ARE ABLE TO DO WITH HEALTH PLANS OR WHATEVER ELSE I MEAN PRETENSIONS FROM SEVEN POINT ONE TO SIX POINT THREE IS THIS. IS A DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU'RE COVERING OUR DIABETES YOU KNOW FROM SIX POINT TWO TO FIVE POINT FIVE OR IS IT BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE WITHIN. THE BY THE THE PLANTS A CONTRACTED WITH. I BELIEVE IT'S A COMPANY YEAH HMO PLANS INCLUDING THE NEW WORK WE'RE DOING ON THE PP OWES -- IT COULD RELATE ALSO WE'VE GOT A YOUNGER POPULATION COMING IN AND AN OLDER POPULATION GOING INTO MEDICARE SO IT'S PARTLY JUST A CHANGING I BELIEVE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC. WE AGGREGATED THIS SEVEN H. MODES IN THE SINGLE MEASURE IN THE THREE PP. PPO PLANS AND A SINGLE MEASURE -- IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF MANY THINGS CARE DESIGN CARE CARE PROGRAM DESIGNED ESPECIALLY CLINICAL TEAM APPROACH UNDER PRIMARY CARE MODELS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEARD. ABOUT A CEOS AND THAT INTEGRATED HEALTH MODEL SOME OF THAT IS ALSO PART OF WHY WE'RE SEEING THAT DIRECTION. IN AND DEAL WITH A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT -- YOU'LL STRENGTH IN CARE PATIENT CENTERED MEDICALHOME -- WHAT'S THE INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT. SO SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE A QUESTION FOR SERVE ALL THREE OF YOU ABOUT. CIVIL TO WHAT. DEALS -- TO WHAT SCALE ARE WE AT NOW TO AND AND HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO TO BRING THAT THE FULL SCALE LIKE ACROSS THE BOARD RATE SO HOW FAR ALONG ARE WE AND WHAT'S. KIND OF STOPPING US FROM GETTING THERE EVERYONE DOWN WITH ME THERE'S I'VE SEEN NUMEROUS STUDIES SHOWING. NO PRIMARY CARE IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- IF YOU LOOK A BARBER STAR FUELS WORK ACTUALLY I THINK I APPRECIATE WHAT CALPERS SAID THAT ABOUT NOT ONLY OF COURSE HAVING A PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIAN BUT ALSO BEING SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOME CONTINUITY A PERSON THAT IS THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO CHANGE PLANS YOU STILL THE OP HE STAY WITH THE SAME PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIANS YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY YOU KNOW REPEATING STAINS EVERY -- THAT'S WHAT MRS SAY SHOWS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT AND THE TRUST HAT COMES WITH IT THAT OFTEN TIMES. IS THE CORE OF WHERE TO SAVINGS EVENTUALLY COMES FROM RIGHT AND AND THE KNOWLEDGE THE POSITION HAS AND THE CARE TEAM HAS WITH WITH THE PATIENT. SITES SO I KNOW EACH OF YOU MENTIONED -- THIS I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF OKAY WELL -- ARE WE ARE WE ARE READY THERE WE HAVE PEOPLE THERE HOW FAR ALONG ARE WE AND IF -- AND FOR THE WAYS AGO WE GET THERE HOW MUCH HOW FAR CAN WE BEND THE COST CURVE BY DOING THAT. SO I DON'T NOBODY'S DISCO MARCH DOWN INTO AND I KNOW YOU SERVED REFERENCE SENSE OF YOUR TESTIMONY READY BUT I GUESS THAT THAT'S A QUESTION LIKE. HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE DO THERE AND -- AND AND WHAT WOULD RESULT FROM THAT -- DOCTORS PAN AND MEMBERS IT LET ME TART BY SAYING WORK WE'RE NOT THERE YET OKAY I THINK WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. BY YOU'VE HEARD THE TERM ALIGNMENT USED OFTEN THIS AFTERNOON. AND I THINK THE THE MORE WE CAN ALIGN WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING. TO A COMMON DEFINITION. RELATIVE TO THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE FOR PATIENTS CENTER MEDICAL HOME YOU'VE HEARD. ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS YOU'VE HEARD INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE ALL MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT FOLKS AND SO ALIGNMENT AROUND THE DEFINITIONS. OF WHAT THOSE ARE I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS THE ALIGNMENT AROUND THAT AS DR JONASSON MENTIONED EARLIER. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A CALPERS NUMBER. A MEDI CAL MEMBER A COVER CALIFORNIA NUMBER WHEN YOU GO IN TO SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN. ARE YOU GOING TO A HOSPITAL SETTING. YOU'RE A PATIENT. AND YOU'RE NOT VIEWED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT LABEL SO TO SPEAK. ASSOCIATED WITH YOU SO WE'D THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT -- I WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT. WHAT I. HA IS DOING IN THIS REGARD -- IS REALLY SETTING THE STANDARD. FOR DEVELOPING THOSE STANDARDS -- I DON'T THINK JEFF SPOKE TO THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION STANDARD DATA SET THAT THEY'VE DONE. WHERE WE'VE COLLECTIVELY AGREED TO WHAT THOSE DATA SETS ARE FOR ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS -- BUT THE MORE WE WORK WITH GROUPS LIKE I HA I THINK THE QUICKER WE WILL GET TO WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO GO. ACTUALLY JUST CENTER FOR ED SO HOW FAR ALONG I MEAN A TO BE LICENSE A LITTLE BIT AFTER QUESTION BUT HOW I MEAN -- WE LIKE HALFWAY THERE COR THE WAY THEY'RE TEN FOR SALE RELIEF DOWN THE BOTTOM 10% OF THE WAY THERE -- I WOULD HATE TO PUT A PERCENTAGE ON IT -- I WOULD SAY WERE FURTHER ALONG THEM WE HAVE BEEN -- AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS WE ARE SEEN A MOVEMENT UP [inaudible] IN -- PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS -- BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM AND IN AGAIN ALSO NOTE DR JONASSON MENTIONED. RURAL AREAS INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE IN RURAL AREAS IS REALLY REALLY HARD. YEAH AND SO WHAT YOU PUT IN PLACE IN A URBAN AREA MAY NOT NECESSARILY WORK IN A RURAL SETTING AND SO WE'VE GOT TO BRIDGE THAT GAP AS WELL. SO -- WERE WAYS AWAY. I THINK WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THERE. WE JUST NEED TO GET KICKED IN THE REAR END A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET US THERE FASTER THAN WE'D LIKE OKAY AND MAYBE JUST ONE OTHER AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS. ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTIONS YOU CAN GIVE THAT MIND SO IF WE WERE ACTUALLY QUOTE ALL THE WAY THERE -- BECAUSE IT WAS WORRIED ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS WERE ACT GOING IF WE WERE QUOTE ALL THE WAY THERE ARE ALMOST ALL THE WAY THERE. IS THAT GOING TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL BEND IN THE COST CURVE ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO THEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO I MEAN REALIZE IF DEMOGRAPHICS WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE IT IS THEIR SAVINGS THAT YOU'RE SAYING AS FAR. AS WHERE WE HOW FAR WE'VE GONE SO FAR IF WE ACTUALLY TOOK IT TO THAT KIND OF SCALE WE COULD GET IT ALL THE WAY THERE WE GOT AND WE A LOT OF PROBLEMS TO GET THEIR NUMBERS TO GO OVERCOME. WHAT IT IS THAT GOING TO RESULT IN A IT IN A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW KOSTER GNOCCHI AGAIN AND? WILL HOPEFULLY SOME SAVINGS BUT BABY ACOSTA RISE MUCH IT'S OUR ENEMY THAT'S WHAT'S IT EVERY IT ARE WE GOING TO DO YOU WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DOCTOR PAN AYE POINT BACK AGAIN TO THE DOCTOR RIGHT OUT PRESENTATION ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN INTEGRATED MODEL AND A PPO AND IN THAT DATE IS ALREADY SO INDICATING THAT. WE'RE GONNA GET THEIR THE MORE WE MOVE INTO THAT INTEGRATED APPROACH YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AFFORDABILITY -- BECOME MORE PREVALENT THAN IT IS TODAY. THANK YOU NINE SELL PER SIX PERSPECTIVE ON AS WELL WE ARE SISTER AGENCIES SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR MANY DECADES WE WORKED WITH -- PETER SAYS STAND UP COVERED CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE. I THINK THEY'RE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS MORE TO DO HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT WE SHARE OUR CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED THEM -- TO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF OUR SMART CARE CALIFORNIA EFFORTS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A LITTLE SHOUT OUT TO SHELVE WHOSE AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. WHO HAVE BEEN FUNDING US FOR FOUR YEARS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY IN COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER OF THE THREE AGENCIES? SO IN FOUR YEARS WE HAVE MOVED THE NEEDLE IS STUCK SAID ON REDUCING SEE SECTIONS. ARE MAKING HUGE ADVANCES IN REDUCING PRESCRIBED -- WE ALSO TO GO TO ADVANCED PRIMARY CARE. WE IN OUR NEW PEOPLE ARE NEW PURSE SELECT PRODUCT WE WANT THAT PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TO REALLY BE LOOKING AT THE EVENT. MANAGING THE FAMILY. EVEN IN WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS THE OTHER THING IS WE DID SPEND TWO YEARS DEVELOPING OUR POPULATION HEALTH MODEL IN DASHBOARD WHICH YOU SAW SOME OF THE DATA FROM THAT. WE HAVE DONE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WE'VE DONE IT IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES BOTH HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND COVERED CALIFORNIA AND WE INTEND TO DO MORE AND SO FROM FIRST PERSPECTIVE IN WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM HOW FAR ALONG YOU THINK YOU ARE -- WE NEED TO GET THE VALUE WE NEED TO REACH WE NEED TO AND WE NEED TO PAY FOR HIGH VALUE CARE AND REDUCE LOW VALUE CARE. AND THAT IS THE WORK WERE CONTINUE TO USE IT I I AGAIN I KNOW IT'S SOMEWHAT ANSWER. AT THE BEGINNING ARE YOU HALFWAY THERE YOU LIST OF THE WAY THERE. LONELY THERE. I WOULD SAY WE'RE OVER WE'RE WE'RE OVER HALF OKAY A LOT TO DO BUT WE AYE IF YOU I CAME HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHEN WE WERE NEGOTIATING RIGHTS FROM SPREAD. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE DISEASE MANAGEMENT SO EXCEPT FOR WHAT WE GOT ANNUALLY FROM HE DOES SO. I THINK WE'RE WELL OVER FIFTY OKAY AND I'M ALSO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE ALSO IT'S IT'S NOT JUST US SILOS BUT THERE'S THE CONNECTION THEIR SIDE DIE DO I KNOWLEDGE THAT THANK YOU. OF ALL. OUR FOLKS ARE MARKED ACCOUNT PRIMARY KERR -- I THINK IF YOU SIMPLY LOOK AT THE AMOUNT IS BEING SPENT PRIMARY CARE IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES -- OREGON RHODE ISLAND SOME OTHERS WE SPEND LESS BOND AND I A THAT'S A CRUDE MEASURE OBVIOUSLY BUT BY THAT MEASURE WERE PROBABLY HALF TO TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY PART WHERE WE SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT BALANCE OF SPENDING ON PRIMARY CARE VERSUS -- STRICTLY CARE HOSPITAL CARE AND SO ON IT'S NOT JUST THAT'S AND HARD TO PUT A NUMBER ON THAT BUT I THINK WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS. PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTATIONS FROM -- CALPERS COVER CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR PURCHASERS. AS WELL AS THE SUPPORT. THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THROUGH OUR ORGANIZATION AND AND MANY OTHERS TO HELP OTHERS PRACTICES PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER MEDIUM SIZED INDEPENDENT PRACTICES -- GET UP TO SPEED TO GET THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS A NEED TO DEVELOP TO CARE BASED TEAM -- PROTOCOLS -- THAT TO HELP THEM. QUALITY SO I THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THERE OF COURSE WEAK WE CAN DO A MUCH BETTER. BOB TERMS OF THE OVERALL HEALTH SYSTEM -- ALL A REMARK THAT. THE ESTIMATES OF WASTE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ARE STILL AROUND 30% -- HI DAVID LANSKY ARE PRESENT CEO TESTIFIED BEFORE THE SENATE HEALTH EDUCATION LABOR AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE LAST -- LAST SUMMER. AND ALL THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TESTIFYING EXPERTS ROUGH AROUND THE COUNTRY. SAID AROUND 30% IS ABOUT RIGHT THAT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS THERE SOME UNNECESSARY CARE BEING PROVIDED -- SOME POOR QUALITY CARE THAT RESULTS IN PEOPLE HAVING TO GO BACK TO BE READMITTED OR FOREVER HEATHER SHOULD BE RE DONE. THURS -- EXORBITANT PRICES BEING CHARGED FOR CERTAIN PROCEDURES CERTAIN DRUGS -- THERE'S AN EXCESS ADMINISTRATIVE BUT THAT TELLS ME THERE'S AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY SO. I'M. I JUST. HELLO MY DIFFERENT ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES HERE I THINK WE'RE MAYBE HALFWAY THERE -- ALWAYS BEEN FOR HER WORK IN HEALTH CARE FOR A LONG TIME. SOME DAYS I WAKE UP AND AMEND TREMENDOUSLY PROUD OF THE ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE -- AND THERE HAVE BEEN DVANCES BUT OTHER DAYS I LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE WITH PERFORMANCE MEASURES WE STILL DON'T HAVE GOOD OUTCOME MEASURES -- STUFF. FOR WE ARE REPORTING UNDERSTATED WAY THE OUTCOMES FOR KEEPING THE REPLACEMENTS WE CAN'T COMPARE. SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY ON THE QUALITY WE HAVE NO OLD. QUALITY MEASURE FOR ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM. STUFF TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT WHY IS THAT -- AND THE MOVEMENT TOWARD VALUE BASED PAYMENT HAS REALLY STALLED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS -- THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT MOVING TO ADAPT BUT IT REALLY HASN'T MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS SO. THE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE EVERYBODY IS GETTING THE BEST QUALITY CARE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. REGARDS OF WHO'S WHO THEY'RE COVERED BY -- IS IS ANOTHER AREA WHICH IS HIS HIDDEN UNDER THE AGGREGATE STATISTICS BUT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL. SO -- I DAYS I WAKE UP AT LEE WITH THE CUP IS HALF FULL OTHER DAYS I THINK IT'S HALF EMPTY -- THERE'S A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IT BUT A LOT STILL TO DO RIGHT [inaudible] THIRTY TWO NO THANK YOU -- I I ACTUALLY I AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE EQUITY TO LOSE IN THE AUDIENCE I I HAVE TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE HER NUYS SAY THAT WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AND WE FEEL HEARD THE NUMBER ABOUT THE 30%. I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS -- SHOE TOLD ME I IS OKAY FOR ME TO SAY THIS. BUT I WILL SAY IS IS THAT. SO NOW IT'S ABOUT THAT WHAT YOU SAID WAS THAT AND NOW YOU AGREED WITH YOU IS IS THAT I OFTENTIMES YOU'LL KNOW 30% OR SOME PERCENTAGE SIZEABLE PERCENTAGE IS QUOTE WASTE BUT IT'S HARD TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS. I MEAN V. CONCERT GLOBALLY SAY BUT YOU START SAYING EACH INDIVIDUAL DECISION WAS THIS THE RIGHT ONE IT'S CENTER I MEAN SOME PREY EASIER THAN OTHERS BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS. THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES LIKE SO -- AND I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT STUDIES PEOPLE TRIED TO PICK OUT WHICH ONES AND SO FORTH BUT PERHAPS -- I THINK OF THE LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT SOME HANDS. ANSWER THAT I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUT I THINK SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING AND PERHAPS CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS YES AND HEALTH EQUITY -- IT'S IT'S A IT'S A COMPONENT THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ENGAGE IN THE CONVERSATION AND INCLUDE. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS -- AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO AND MOST LIKELY A A SISTER OF GETTING THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS IN IN -- A BETTER PLACE AND THEY ARE TODAY. A SOMEONE TO TALK ABOUT SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH I COULD NOT AGREE MORE -- SO I GUESS THE OTHER OBSERVATION -- JUST MAKE BEFORE I LET YOU ALL GO IS IS THAT WE HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA. PURRS WE HAVE A LARGE PRIVATE SECTOR GROUP AND MAYBE CAN HELP US RECRUIT MORE AND I'M GONNA HAVE MEDI CAL COME OUT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD FROM YOU IS THAT WE NEED ALIGNMENT WE NEED TO TRY TO PUT THINGS SIMILARLY. SO -- I GUESS I WOULD BEFORE I LET YOU GO SAY LET ME KNOW. LIKE WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO DO THIS WE HAVE YOU ALL HERE LET'S WHAT CAN WE DO AND I FOR YEAH WE HAD -- TALKED RIGHT OUT HERE EARLIER AS WELL AND I THINK SOMEONE YOU KNOW THE CENTER STONE ASKED BUT YOU KNOW LOOK IF BETWEEN IF WE ADD TO ALL OF YOU OUT. WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD CHUNK OF THE MARKET RIGHT AND SO WHAT CAN WE ALL DO TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE AIMS YOU TALKED ABOUT SO WE CAN MOVE THAT FARTHER ALONG I REALIZE IS AN ABSTRACT QUESTION BUT UT YOU KNOW MOVE FROM. IT HALFWAY OR YOU KNOW IT IN THE BEGINNING OF EVER TO TO TO THE HIGHER SCALE SO -- THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE GOVERNMENT MAD MAD BILL PLAY IN TERMS OF IS A CONVENE OR AT SOLELY I WANT. TO SEE THAT WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU. OKAY SO OUR NEXT PANEL WILLIAMS SHIFT TO MEDI CAL -- BUT IT'S ALL PART OF A SCENE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER PERONE THE DIRECTOR IMPROVING ACCESS IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WELCOME. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. AND I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT WELL IN SOME WAYS ALTHOUGH THERE LOWER INCOME THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN HUMAN BEINGS AND PERHAPS OF THE SAME THINGS APPLY RIGHT NOW. BUT I WILL LET LET LET YOU PRESENT AND YOU CAN TELL ME. WELL THANK YOU -- CHAIRPERSON PAN AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE FOR THIS INVITATION TO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE -- PERFORMANCE -- IN MEDICAL PROGRAM -- IN A FEW MINUTES THAT I HAVE I WILL ADDRESS SIR TO QUESTIONS TODAY -- THE FIRST IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE QUALITY OF CARE -- IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- MANAGED CARE WERE 90% OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL AND RELEASE GET THEIR COVERAGE AND WHAT MIGHT CALIFORNIA DO DIFFERENTLY. TO ACCELERATE IMPROVEMENTS AND ACCESS TO CARE AND QUALITY FOR MEDI CAL AND WILLYS. THE FIRST WE KNOW THE QUALITY OF CARE -- IT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE WHAT PLAN YOU'RE ENROLLED IN IN YOUR RACE AND ETHNICITY. ACCORDING TO THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE DASHBOARD THAT'S PRODUCED QUARTERLY BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AGGREGATED SCORES OF QUALITY FREE TO THE HEALTH PLANS VARIES BY A FACTOR OF TWO AND A HALF. THESE AGGREGATE SCORES ROLL OUT SEVERAL QUALITY MEASURES. TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SNAPSHOT OF OVERALL QUALITY FOR EACH PLAN BUT MASK IMPORTANT. CLINICAL INSIGNIFICANT EXCUSE ME IMPORTANT DOT CLINICAL AND HUMAN TOLL OF THE VARIATION. FOR EXAMPLE 74% OF WOMEN AND ROLLED IN SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH PLAN RECEIVED THEIR RECOMMENDED CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING. AMONG WOMEN ENROLLED IN HEALTH NET IN SAN DIEGO ONLY 41% DID. AMONG MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH HYPERTENSION RESIDING IN THE INLAND EMPIRE 69% OF THOSE ENROLLED INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN HOW THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE ADDED WE CONTROLLED. WHEREAS LESS THAN 40% OF THOSE ENROLLED IN MOLINA HEALTH CARE DEAD SO THEY'RE NOT JUST YOU RAPID DISPARITIES EVEN WITHIN COUNTY FIND SOMEBODY'S DISPARITIES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO FOUND DISPARITIES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WITH BLACK IN NATIVE AMERICANS FREQUENTLY FARING WORSE THAN OTHER MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. SECOND WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS QUALITY OF CARE HAS NOT IMPROVED PROGRAM LIED ON MOST QUALITY MEASURES. A STUDY BY UCSF RESEARCHERS THAT IS SOON TO BE PUBLISHED FINDS OUT OF FORTY ONE QUALITY MEASURES QUALITY AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE MEASURES COLLECTED AND REPORTED BY DIETZ YES. THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON ONLY SIXTY ACROSS ALL MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR TWENTY THERE'S BEEN LITTLE CHANGE AND FOR FIVE THESE MEASURES HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DECLINING QUALITY. SO HOW COULD THIS BE THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO TWO IN PARTICULAR. FIRST WEN A MEDI CAL AND MANAGED CARE PLAN MAKES INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR ITS MEMBERS. AND THESE INVESTMENTS ALSO LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT AND LOWER COST CARE D. H. U. S. REDUCES WHAT IT PLAYS THE PLAN. IN THE NEXT RATE SETTING CYCLE. THIS PHENOMENON CALLEDPREMIUM SLIDE DISCOURAGES MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR MAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS AND SERVICES TO TOUCH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS LIKE HOUSING SUPPORT ARE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS. OR INVESTING TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE PROVIDER NETWORK. AND FOR THOSE THAT DO YOU PREMIUMS SLIDE MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CAN YOU MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS OVER TIME. SECOND UNLIKE MOST OTHER METHODS GIVE ME UNLIKE MANY OTHER MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR IT'S HEALTH PLAN THAT REWARDS PLANS WHEN THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT QUALITY CARE OR IMPROVE. A QUALITY OVER TIME. SO WHAT MY CALIFORNIA DO DIFFERENTLY TO CATALYZE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS AND QUALITY FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT AND HAFTER HEARING FROM A DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF MEDI CAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY SUPPORT A VISION OF SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY. TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY HIGH VALUE HOLE PERSON CARE. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION LAUNCHED A PROJECT TO DESIGN A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE PREMIUM SLIDE. ISSUE AND PROMOTE MORE RAPID QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE HIRED CITY MAN FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND CHIP SERVICES IN YOUR BOMB ADMINISTRATION AND ENGAGE IN ADVISORY GROUP THAT HEALTH PLAN CEOS AND CFO'S. THERE EVER PRODUCED RECOMMENDATIONS FOREIGN PLAN IF IT MEETS THREE CRITERIA. FIRST A GENEROUS COST SAVINGS GREATER THAN A THRESHOLD ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS ACTUARIES. SECOND NEEDS QUALITY TARGETS BASED ON PROVIDING EXCELLENT QUALITY OF CARE OR DEMONSTRATING SIGNIFICANT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. AND THREE IT DEMONSTRATES THAT IS INVESTING AT LEAST A SPECIFIED AMOUNT INTO HEALTH RELATED INVESTMENTS AS DEFINED BY THE STATE. ONE OF THE MAIN BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING. THIS APPROACH HOWEVER IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL APPROACHES CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE IN TODAY THE FOUNDATION PUBLISHED A NEW REPORT DESCRIBES FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. I THINK YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. THIS REPORT MAKING QUALITY MATTER MEDI CAL MANAGES CARE DESCRIBES EACH OF THESE FIVE APPROACHES AND FOR EACH PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE STATE IS PUTTING. THIS APPROACH IN THE PRACTICE. SOME ARE SIMPLER TO ADMINISTER THAN OTHERS SOME WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING OR REALLOCATION OF EXISTING MEDICAL FUNDS. OF COURSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES IN VALUE BASE PAY ARE NOT A PANACEA AND DH YES HAS AND USES MANY TOOLS IN ITS TOOL CHEST. TO MANAGE THE MANAGE CARE PROGRAM. PROCUREMENT CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT PUBLIC PURPORTING TO NAME A FEW. LATER THIS SPRING WE WILL PUBLISH A REPORT THE PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS BASED ON A REVIEW OF PRACTICES BY DH CS COVER CALIFORNIA CALPERS. AND FIVE OTHER STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS. LASTLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE H. YES AND IT'S PLAN PARTNERS. FOR WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR MEMBERS. AND THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS OF PLANTS ARE REFLECTED IN IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR QUALITY SCORES OVER TIME. MOREOVER WHAT DH YES AND IT'S HEALTH PLANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN JUST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IS TRULY IMPRESSIVE AS A PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MILLIONS OF NEW ENROLLEES. MANY WITH COMPLEX CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR TACKLING KEY PRIORITIES SUCH AS ADDING A NEW MAP MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WITH STRONGER INCENTIVES INAPPROPRIATE FLEXIBILITY HOWEVER WE CAN AND SHOULD EXPECT BETTER OUTCOMES FROM A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AS MANY STATES ALREADY DO. I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES CENTER STONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- I WAS NEVER -- M. SLIDE. AND IT -- I FIND IT RATHER SHOCKING. THAT -- HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT INVESTS AND YOU KNOW. MAKING SURE THAT THE THE DIABETICS ARE WELL CONTROLLED ENTIRE PRETENCES SO THE BLOOD PRESSURE THEIR BLOOD FATS ARE REGULARLY MONITORED AND CONTROLLED. A WE GET PENALIZED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- FOR THEIR MAKING THEIR PATIENTS HEALTHY WHICH IS THE GOAL I THINK OF OF OF WHAT OUR HEALTH CARE PLAN SHOULD BE DOING IS TRYING -- TO MAKE PEOPLE HEALTHIER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN IN TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE FRONT AND WHICH WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF MONEY IN IN IN IN THE BACK AND WHAT CAN WE DO. TO TO MAKE. GET RID OF THIS -- TERRIBLE POLICY -- THAT. PROVIDES EIGHTY ANTI INCENTIVE FOR PREVENTIVE CARE -- WELL THE REPORT THAT I MENTIONED -- OFFERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AND HAS -- THE REPORT INDICATES OTHER STATES TEXAS FLORIDA NEW YORK -- THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE EMPLOYING THESE TYPES OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR HEALTH PLANS. MANY OF THESE MODELS WOULD ADDRESS THE PREMIUMS LIKE NOT ALL OF THEM. AS A SAID SOME WOULD COST THE STATE SOME MORE MONEY BUT THERE ARE TRADE OFFS TEAM MADE IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY VERSUS COST -- BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE APPROACHES THAT ARE BEING USED IN THE FIELD AND AND THE REPORTS TO BE PRODUCED OFFER SOME SOME OPTIONS THERE I'M SURE THOSE HIGHER COSTS OR NOT GOING TO BE IN COMPARISON TO THE INVESTMENT IS MADE IN THE FRONT AND A WHAT THE PLANS ARE. GONNA HAVE TO PAY AND THE AND THE BACK AND WHEN SOMEBODY HAS AN CONTROLLED -- BLOOD PRESSURE ENDS UP IN A HOSPITAL WITH A STROKER OF A HEART ATTACK THE COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED THROUGH REGULAR MONITORING AND A LITTLE BIT OF AN INVESTMENT. SO -- YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND FINDING OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN -- ELIMINATE THIS TERRIBLE POLICY AND EMBRACE MAYBE SOME OF THE SUCCESSES AND OTHER STATES OF HAND. AND I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON WHAT CENTER STONES AND I'VE MET THAT I ACTUALLY -- FORTUNATELY WAS AWARE OF THE PREMIUM SLIDE I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH DIRECTOR TENT AND A DRUG CAN'T WELL -- ABOUT -- THIS -- I WAS TOLD THAT SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO IS SEE CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE OTHER STATES DO IT IF CMS IS THE REASON WE CAN'T. KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S A FEDERAL MATCH INVOLVED FOR MEDI CAL. FOR MEDICAID -- HOW HOW THIS TAXES OR THE OTHER STATES HAVE FORTUNATE CHANCE TO REACH YOUR FULL REPORT BUT? I MEAN IS IS THERE A FEDERAL BARRIER TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW OKAY SO WHIMS WE MADE INVESTMENT WE IMPROVE OUR DIABETES CARE NOW THAT THE SPENDING DROPPED IS THE FED'S GO BACK AND SAY WELL BECAUSE WE PAY HALF OF THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU YOU KNOW WE WERE GOING TO PAY LESS I MEAN THE TWENTY OUT OF CAN YOU PERHAPS SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYS AND CMS PLAYS GIVEN THE FACT THAT MEDICAID IS A FIFTY FIFTY WITH -- LEASE FOR US FIFTY FIFTY SUPPOSED STATE TO GET BETTER FEDERAL MATCH FOR US IN TERMS OF MUST BE ABLE. TO ADDRESS THE PREMIUM SLIDING PROVIDE POSITIVE SENATOR PEOPLE FOR PLANS AND OTHERS WHO ARE INNOVATING WHO. WELL IT -- THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND CAN FEDERAL POLICY IS -- EVOLVING FORGE THAT ARE GIVING STATES FLEXIBILITY -- TO TACKLE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH -- HIGH SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW YOU APPROACH TO MODEL -- THERE ARE SOME -- APPROACHES THAT -- DIRECTLY TACKLE -- THINGS LIKE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT DO REQUIRE FEDERAL WAIVERS -- THIS IS A HARD TIME TO BE REQUESTING FEDERAL WAIVERS THERE ARE OTHER PROCEDURES THAT ARE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT STATE MEDICAID. PROGRAMS CAN ALREADY DO -- AND AND WORK THAT WE DID WITH -- WITH -- CITY MAN WITH HER FEDERAL EXPERTISE OFFER AN APPROACH -- MEDICAID WAIVER OKAY SO FOR SIR FOR FREE OKAY AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL AND SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS -- THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PORTS OF ALIGNMENT AND SO. WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MEDI CAL THE SYSTEM OVER HERE AND EVERYONE ELSE FOR SHEER. SO DO YOU HAVE SOME -- PERHAPS AND I KNOW IF YOU'RE HERE TO HEAR THE OTHER PANEL YOU'VE OKAY GOOD -- SO AND I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION DOES A LOT OF WORK NOT ONLY WITH MEDI CAL BUT ALSO PRIVATE. I MEAN WHO WHO IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE FORTY OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IT FOR MEDI CAL. IS A PAIR THAT COVERS A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ALSO BE IN THE SAME ALIGNMENT AS OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS ARE A PART OF HERS AND ARMS COVERED CALIFORNIA AND AND AND AND OTHER PRIVATE PURCHASING GROUPS. AND TERMS OF BEING ABLE -- TO TO ACTUALLY YOUNG FRATELLI BASED PAYMENT AND BEND THE COST CURVE OVERALL FOR THE STATE'S. MAIL PIZZA DOES TO WHAT DEGREE SHOULD THE M. AND WE NEED THIS MEDI CAL NEED TO BE LINED UP WITH EVERYONE ELSE SO THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A PROGRAM APART. WELL IT IS -- I THINK IT'S ALIGNMENT -- GREATER LINE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR GONNA MOVE -- THAT DELIVERY SYSTEM FORWARD -- TO REALLY ALL CALIFORNIANS -- ME NO MEDI CAL IS A UNIQUE PROGRAM IS A UNIQUE COVERAGE PROGRAM THAT COVERS MANY POPULATIONS THAT OTHER SOURCES OF COVERAGE AND DO NOT -- SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF SOME OF THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF SOME OF THE MEDI CAL AND MEDICAID IN GENERAL AND YET THERE ARE IN ORDER FOR NORMA'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER ALIGNMENT -- ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE INVOLVED IN IS EXPANDING ACCESS TO TELL HEALTH PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT -- MILLION DOLLARS NETWORK ISSUES SURE SHORTAGES OF PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE PROGRAM -- AND WHAT WE FIND IS EVEN WHEN THERE IS A PLAN THAT IS VERY COMMITTED -- INCLUDING SOME PLANS THAT ARE HERE TODAY TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO TELL HEALTH IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE PLAN THAT'S COMMITTED -- THAT PROVIDERS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH -- AS YOU'VE HEARD -- AND HAS BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE. REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE PLANS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH OUR SORT OF ROWING IN SYNC SO THE NOT GETTING DIFFERENT CENTERS OR SOME PLANS ARE PLAYING FOR THINGS AND SOME PLANS AREN'T SO. GREATER IN LYMAN WHETHER IT'S IN PAYMENT OR WHETHER IT'S IN -- INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN VALUE BASED PAYMENT IS -- IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU AND A SO AS TO THEM -- TOOK QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT DOES YOUR FINDING THAT THERE'S LACK OF IMPROVEMENT AND THE PERFORMANCE I MEAN QUALITY PERFORMANCES BEEN. DONE. THE SUM UP SOME DOWN BUT GENERALLY THERE HASN'T. BEEN A PROVEN OVER TIME SO I THINK TO ME THAT'S PRETTY CONCERNING -- WHEN I WAS JEERED SOMEBODY HEALTH COMMITTEE? WE MADE THAT THAT MEDI CAL PLANS ON THE CAPS SURVEY GENTLY PERFORM THOSE COMMERCIAL PLANS ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE BUT THE MOST THE MEDICAL PLANS WERE WANTS. TO AND THAT WAS VERY CONCERNING AS WELL AND SO -- I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- NOW IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AT IN TERMS OF AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME -- SOME OUTSTANDING PLANTS PRESENTING BUT THE YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST BUT WE'D FATHER BUT FROM EQUITY STANDPOINT EVERYONE SHOULD BE AT THAT LEVEL. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS PERHAPS THAT YOUR THOUGHTS THAT MEDI CAL SHOULD BE DOING TO MOVE THE PLANS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE MIDDLE OR BOTTOM. UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD. WELL I THINK -- I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- AS WE LOOK AT THE QUALITY AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE SCORES THERE ARE PLANS THAT ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS JOB AND HAVE IMPROVED -- EITHER SCORES FOR INDIVIDUAL QUALITY MEASURES OR IN AGGREGATE THEY'VE MOVE THOSE FORWARD -- AND YET -- DAY ARE PERHAPS MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE -- AND IN THE APPROACH THAT WE CAME TO AGAIN LOOKING AROUND OTHER STATES IS THE NOTION OF WE NEED. TO AS WE SEE MANY PLANS. OPERATING PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AND OTHER VALUE BASED PROGRAMS WITH THEIR PROVIDERS -- IT'S PERHAPS TIME TO THE STATE TO DO THE SAME -- REALLY WANTS TO SEE BIGGER IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY AND AND PATIENT ACCESS. NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INCENTIVES ARE LINED WITH THOSE WITH THOSE CALLS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE. ADDITION CENTERS THEM. THE JUDGES TO FOLLOW UP ON ON SENATOR HANDS -- A COMMENTS ABOUT THE IMPROVING KAREN AND MEDI CAL SHE IN RURAL AREAS IS CHALLENGING. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE A LOT OF PROVIDERS JUST WON'T TAKE MEDI CAL BECAUSE THE FEES ARE JUST RIDICULOUSLY LOW. SO WOULD YOU SEE AN ACCESS TO THE THE FEES THAT ARE PAID AND MEDIC HOW WORK WERE FOR MORE PROBABLY TO FEE FOR SERVICE NOW ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THE MANAGED CARE. ALEXI A LARGER CAPITATED A BUDGET AS WELL. BUT DO YOU SEE AN ACCESS TO THE THE FEE AND THEY QUALITY OF CARE THIS DELIVERED I'M SORRY DO I SEE A WHITE TO THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE MEDI CAL FEE PAID FOR FEE FOR SERVICE AND THE AND THE AND THE LOWER RATINGS IF YOU WILL OF SERVICE OF PEOPLE. ARE REPORTING. WELL -- THAT'S A THAT'S EIGHT IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IN THE PAST WHEN MEDI CAL WAS MOSTLY A FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM -- AND WE LOOKED AT NATIONALLY AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID FEE FOR SERVICE RATES AND MEASURES OF ACCESS -- THERE IS DEFINITELY A RELATIONSHIP THERE INSTANCE STATED GENERALLY TO PAY LOWER AXIS IS POOR AND STATES THAT PAY BETTER ACCESS IS THAT TENDS TO BE BETTER -- YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES IT MEDI CAL IS PREDOMINATELY A MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS IS -- IS IS ABSURD BEHIND A FIREWALL RIGHT IS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC INFORMATION WHAT THE PLANS ARE PAYING -- WE CERTAINLY HEARING YOU MAY HEAR THIS THIS AFTERNOON FROM PLANS THAT ARE PAYING WELL ABOVE MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE RATES OFTEN IN EXCESS OF WHAT MEDICARE PAYS -- TO ENSURE THAT THEIR NET THEIR MEMBERS HAVE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CARE ON SOMETIMES THEY WILL SAY EVEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GET -- THE PHYSICIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SO -- BUT WE JUST WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD DATA NOW TODAY IN THE IN THE IN THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS -- IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IS NOT TRANSPARENCY THAT MANY POSITION GROUPS ARE CAPITATED SO THERE ISN'T A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SERVICE AND A PAYMENT ANYMORE -- SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT SORT OF COMPLICATE THAT THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. I HOPE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT ACTUALLY -- ARE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- AT IT WE DID THAT HEARING ON A RATE SETTING HOW SO HOW THIS MEDI CAL ACTUALLY -- DTS SETS RATES WITH HEALTH PLANS WE KNOW THAT SOME HEALTH PLANS THAT WE HAD HEALTH PLAN FOR THEM MEDI CAL HEALTH PLAN THAT SAID THE ACTUAL PAY MEDICARE RATES. SO THE WERE DAY NEGOTIATED THAT WE HAD OUT THAT ARE REALLY ANOTHER ONE THAT DOESN'T HOT -- AND THEY REPORTED MORE THEY SEEM THE FOR FOR MORE ISSUES AND I THINK WE'RE PLAYING TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AS WELL SO -- I THINK WE'LL LOOK AT SOME FUTURE OF AS WELL SO WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT ISSUE BUT THANK YOU FOR IN THAT UP CENTER STOP. AND DOCTOR PAN ON THE ON THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS ABOUT HOW FAR ALONG ARE WE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE DEAD DELIVERY SYSTEM ACROSS THE COMMERCIAL PAYERS AND MEDICAL IS NEXT -- BUT THERE ARE SOME. UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF THE MEDI CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM -- A GREATER RELIANCE ON PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND I WOULD SAY THERE WE ARE JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE -- HE I WOULD POINT -- I THINK I WAS AT A POINT OF PRIDE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARMY HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS THE PRIME PROGRAM A WAIVER PROGRAM FOR PUBLIC HOSPITALS. IS A VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT TIES PAYMENTS -- TO QUALITY AND REDUCING DISPARITIES -- I THINK WE IF WE WANT TO SEE THE KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS -- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WE NEED TO X. THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR I DIDN'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DINNER LAST WAIVER AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP AT DTS FOR BUILDING AT VALLEY BASED APPROACH WITH THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS. AND SO -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT WAYS TO EXPAND ON THAT I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING IN DC AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH WITH THEM BUT HOPING WE CAN. THAT MUTUALLY THEY'LL EVER WILL SEE BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR STATE -- OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR FOR DEVELOPING BETTER MODELS THAT WILL ACTUALLY SAVE US BOTH MONEY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO NEXT UP. WE HAVE FROM HELL. MEDICARE CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICARE CORONATION WE HAVE -- FOR PLANS ARE FACTUALLY. WILL SOME PLANS AND SOME SYSTEMS HERE -- WE HAVEDOCTOR ROBERT MOORE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER PARTNERSHIP. DOCTOR TO RESEARCH -- MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR AND THE TREE CARE QUALITY OF INTER A COUNTY HEALTH CARE AND BILL HENNEMAN. DIRECTOR SPECIAL PROGRAMS THE ANTHEM BLUE CROSS I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL HERE AND CHRISSY HERE -- SHARING WITH US -- SOME OF THE COOL THINGS YOU'RE DOING AND INTERESTING THINGS YOU'RE DOING WITH THE CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICARE COORDINATION AND HOW HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALSO TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT HOW YOU'D SEE TAKING WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO SCALE ACROSS MEDI CAL I REALIZE THAT MANY YOU'VE YA I HAVE MY OWN. CLINIC SYSTEM A HEALTH PLAN BUT YOU KNOW YOU COLLEAGUES WELL ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO THAT SO WELCOME THANK YOU AND I GUESS WE'LL START WITH ACT MORE HE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO CHAIR PAN AND SENATORS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE JUST -- SPEAKING WITH YOU MY NAME IS ROBERT MOORE AND THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A NOT FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY BASED -- MEDI CAL BANISH CARE ORGANIZATION -- PARTNERSHIP IS PART OF THE YES COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM MODEL TALK TOUCH BASE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT IT'S GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS THERE'S SELECTED BY THE COUNTY GOVERNMENTS OF THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES. THAT WE SERVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LARGELY RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS JUST A NOTE ON THE CASE MIX -- IN REATION TO THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM MODEL A BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL PLANNED THAT SORT OF THAT THAT WE SHARE OR OR OR OR COMPETE WITH IN IN THAT MODEL. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO -- INCENTIVE AT THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL TO TRY TO SHUFFLE OUT HIGH COST PATIENTS LIKE PEACE WITH HEPATITIS C. OR AVOID OF PROVIDING CARE ANYWAY SO THAT'S ONE SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF OF APPROACHING OUT. SO AS AS THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER MIGHT -- WHEN I WAKE UP EACH MORNING TO THINKING ABOUT IS HOW TO IMPROVE WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT THE AYE AYE IS A? AS A HEALTH PLAN A FAMILY DOCTORS WORKING WITHIN THE HEALTH PLAN CAN LEVERAGE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED BY OUR OUR PRIMARY CARE NETWORK. AND AND SO I'VE IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE MAJOR POINTS OF OF THAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS BUT THEY THEY'RE IN FOUR CATEGORIES ON THE FIRST IS -- THE LEVELS AT WHICH THE DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT LEVELS IN WHICH THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM CAN IMPACT CHRONIC DISEASE CARE -- THE SECOND IS -- LOOKING AT THE DOMAINS OF QUALITY THAT THAT CAN BE AFFECTED AND REALLY A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATIONS IS FOCUSING ON JUST A SUBGROUP OF THOSE TO MAYES WE'VE KIND OF TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THINGS LIKE CAPS AND AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS BUT THERE ARE THERE EVEN MORE THAN WHAT WE PRODUCT -- THERE'S ALSO THE LEVERS ON FOR ACTUALLY CHANGING BEHAVIOR TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND I WILL JUST -- AND I'LL -- I'LL JUST SAY THAT OF THE THE SEVEN MAJOR LEVERS FIRM FOR CHANGING BEHAVIOR -- PAY FOR PERFORMANCE IS PROBABLY THE THIRD WORST IT'S NOT THE NOT NOT THE BEST ONE ITS INTEREST THERE OTHER STRONGER ONES. AND THEN LASTLY JUST A FEW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS CAN HAVE THE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE CREATING THAT. AMONG HAT IS ONE MAKE FOUR POINTS IN OF TURNOVERS MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES THE FIRST IS THAT -- THE QUALITY OF OF CHRONIC DISEASE FIGHT IT IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE OFFICE BETWEEN PHYSICIANS THEIR CARE TEAMS AND THEIR PRIMARY CARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S THAT'S FOR THE MONEY SO. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THIS ACTIVITY HAPPEN SO AND AND ALL PAUSE AND I'LL BE COMING BACK TO THAT LATER. ON THE SECOND IS THINKING ABOUT ABOUT PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS -- WITHIN SORT OF THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MODEL I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT'S NOT THE HOLY GRAIL IT'S NOT THE WAY OF IT BY TWEAKING OR COMING UP WITH A A PARTICULAR PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM WE CAN. MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE ALL THE GOALS WE WANT TO AND AND THERE ARE WEAPONS PARTICULARLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT. RATCHETING THE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE DOWN TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL THERE'S SOME THOUGHT THAT WELL YOU JUST KIND OF KEEP PAYING FOR PERFORMANCE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FRONT LINE LEVEL THAT SOMEHOW MAGICALLY RESULTS IN IMPROVEMENT. THERE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE FOUND THAT ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO HELPING IMPROVE QUALITY. OF THE INCLUDE SHARING DATA AND THAT TAKES -- MONEY EFFORT TO CREATE MECHANISMS FOR STANDARDIZING DATA AND SHARING IT WITH OUR PROVIDER SO THEY KNOW WHICH KIDS NEED THERE'S THERE'S THEIR TWO YEAR OLD SHOTS YOU KNOW BUT WHICH IN WHICH KIDS ARE AT RISK OF NOT HAVING THEIR VACCINATIONS BE UP TODAY PAGE -- TO ALSO THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING WE DO WE DO WITH FOR INSTANCE I'M I'M FIVE DRAWING UPON -- VACCINES AS AN EXAMPLE -- TRAININGS ON WHAT WE LEARNED FOR BEST PRACTICES THAT PRACTICES MIGHT DO TO CHANGE THE THE LANGUAGE AROUND VACCINATION FOR EXAMPLE -- PROVIDING COMPARATIVE DATE IS A POWERFUL A TOOL WHERE YOU ACTUALLY -- LET ALL A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROVIDERS SEE HOW THEY COMPARE WITH EACH OTHER THE LOWER PROVIDERS CAN ASK THE HIGHER PROVIDERS WHERE THEY DO DIFFERENTLY MAYBE FEEL A LITTLE EMBARRASSED BIKE AT THAT SOCIAL PRESSURE WHICH IS THE TOP METHOD OF CHANGING BEHAVIOR -- AND TO BRING THAT TO BEAR AND THEN THERE ARE SOME DIRECT TO MEMBER ACTIVITIES THAT HEALTH PLANS MADE DUE TO TO INFLUENCE AT SOME OF THE ONES WE'VE DONE AROUND -- VACCINATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE INCLUDE MEMBER INCENTIVES FOR FOR COMPLETING VACCINATIONS ARE WELL CHILD VISITS -- A MARKETING CAMPAIGN WERE RE -- TALK -- BROADER MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO KIND OF CREATE A MESSAGE THAT DOESN'T TURN OFF -- A PARENTS WHO WERE CONSIDERING NOT VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN BUT TO GIVE THEM -- THE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO MAYBE TO MAYBE START TO CHANGE OUR MINDS. AND EVEN HOLDING VACCINE EVENTS WITH WITH PUBLIC HEALTH RECURSOS WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITIES ARE THEY MAY BE SEPARATE FROM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WE CAN INTERVENE SUGGEST THAT CONCEPT OF THE MONEY DOESN'T ALL SLOW DOWN SECOND POINT. ON THIRD POINT IS THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS. THAT IT IT TO CREATE BE VERY CAREFUL IN OUR DESIGN -- IF THE IF IT'S NOT DESIGN WELL YOU CAN HAVE SOME MAJOR NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ULCER ONE THAT WE'VE NOTICED IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM AGAIN HAVING TO DO WITH VACCINATION SINCE I KNOW THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR -- TO CENTER PANTS HEART IS THAT -- IF WE SET THE BAR REALLY HIGH FOR FOR A PEDIATRIC VACCINATIONS FOR INSTANCE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE IN SCITUATE -- NATIONALLY SOME PRACTICES WILL SAY YOU KNOW I'VE GOT THESE PARENTS TO REFUSING VACCINATION I'M JUST GONNA GET A MODERATE PRACTICE AND THEN WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL -- SORT OF THEIR VACCINE REFUGEE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM THIS IS GOING TO SUFFER IF THEY GET THEM IN THERE SUCH AN EXAMPLE THE NAY OF CONSEQUENCE FOR WE'VE DONE IT PARTNERSHIP AS WE LOWERED THE THRESHOLD LITTLE BIT JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT WE DON'T WANT TO TO HIT. 90% TELL BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT RIGHT THAT THAT THAT SORT OF THE THE KIDS WITHOUT PRIMARY CARE HOMES. AND THEN ON THE LAST THE LAST POINT IS I KNOW THAT -- CHRIS KIND OF TALKED A BIT ABOUT. THE THE CHANGES WITH MEDICAL MANAGE COLONEL JUST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO'S THE RECIPIENT OF THE DH CS IS -- ACTIVITIES ONE THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT -- ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THEY THEY DEFINITELY RAMPED UP DCS RAMPED UP ITS ITS ATTENTION TO THE QUALITY OUTCOMES. AND IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO SEE THAT AFFECT BUT WE DID SEE THAT IF YOU COMPARE DATA THAT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY HAPPEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY IS BEING COLLECTED NOW SHE WON'T HAVE THAT. TILL THIS SUMMER ON THERE IS ABOUT A 425% IMPROVEMENT GLOBALLY IF YOU JUST LOOKED AT ALL THE PLANTS GLOBALLY ACROSS THAT I KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE HAD A RAW DATA AND LEAD IMPROVE BY ABOUT 45% WE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT BUT A RELATIVE RANKING SEE OTHER HEALTH PLANS WAS ABOUT THE SAME BECAUSE SO I THINK THAT. THAT IT EXTRA ATTENTION INCLUDING THREATS OF OF FINANCIAL SANCTIONS CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS GOING INTO TO SEE THAT GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT EXPLAIN ALL THE ACTIVITIES YOU'RE DOING ARE HAVING AN IMPACT IN THE BIG QUESTION IS. WHEN YOU PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO SOMETHING DO YOU HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL BENEFITS YOU GET A FEW OUT OF FINANCIAL CENTER ON TOP THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION SO? SO THAT'S THOSE ARE THE MAIN THOUGHT IN AND JUST. ONE FOLLOW UP ON THE CONCEPT OF INTEGRATION I WISH THAT THERE WERE MORE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS LIKE A CONTRACT WITH UP AND YOU KNOW HUMBOLDT AND AND AND MODOC COUNTY SAN AND SISKIYOU COUNTY BUT THEY'RE IN OUR RURAL AREAS TO JUST THERE AREN'T ANY SO ALTHOUGH IT OUT THE IDEA. OF GREATER INTEGRATION IS A GOOD STRATEGY FOR LIKE LA -- FOR RURAL AREAS THE BEST WE CAN DO IS A PSEUDO INTEGRATION AND HEALTH PLAN LIKE A COUNTY WE'RE GONNA SELL SYSTEM THAT'S MY GOAL IS TO BE A PSEUDO INTEGRATOR OF THAT HEALTH CARE. AND AND I'D LOVE TO TURN OVER -- TO OF ONE OF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS WHO IS THE CEO AND ALSO PHYSICIAN AT A HIGH PERFORMING HEALTH CENTER IN YOLO COUNTY TO KIND OF SEE TO KIND OF EXPLAIN HOW WHAT WE DO. AFFECTS THEIR WHOLE CENTER. LOS. THANKS DOCTOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LIKE BOB SAID I MELISSA MARSHALL AND A FAMILY DOCTOR IN THE CO COMMUNICATOR JUST ACROSS THE RIVER. WE TAKE CARE OF ONE EIGHT YOU'LL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND VISITS A YEAR. SO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION WERE SERVING. A BEFORE I START I ACTUALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR ALIGNMENT QUESTION. AND IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT PRIMARY CARE SPEND. SO NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT PRIMARY CARE SPEND IS ABOUT 527% OF THE TOTAL SPEND. AND PARTNERSHIP ACTUALLY INVEST QUITE A BIT MORE IN THEIR Q. I. P. THAT ACTUALLY ATTRIBUTES FOR A HIGHER LEVEL OF SPEND. WE ALSO SEE THAT IN PRIVATE INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO PLACES LIKE HIGHS ARE ALSO IN CARE. AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SLIDE IN TERMS OF PAYMENTS FOR HEALTH PLANS YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT EVERYBODY GETTING SQUEEZED IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARY CARE SPEND. AND SO I THINK IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION OR THINGS YOU CAN DO. ALIGNING INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST BANKS ARE GOING TO HAVE FOR THE BUCK -- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT Q. I. P. BECAUSE IT'S HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR COMMUNICATOR -- IT ALLOWS US TO INVEST IN BOTH ROLES AN INFRASTRUCTURE -- THE ROLES ARE PRETTY VARIED SO WE A COMMUNICATOR WE HAVE A CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER I I WAS PRETTY EXCITED TO JOIN COMMUNICATOR THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER -- IT SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LEADERSHIP INVESTMENT IN QUALITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE ALSO HAVE PREVENTIVE CARE COORDINATORS IN EACH OF OUR SITES AND THOSE FOLKS BASICALLY. THEY SERVE AS KIND O THE RING MASTER FOR ALL OF THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. WE ALSO HAVE A CASE MANAGER THE DOES CARE TRANSITIONS SO ANYTIME SOMEONE'S IN THE HOSPITAL OR IN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE HAVE SOMEONE HELPING TO BRIDGE THAT PERSON BACK TO THE HEALTH CENTER. WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCES COSTS. I'M WITH OUR REGIONAL CONSORTIA REDWOOD COMMUNITY HEALTH COALITION WE'VE INVESTED IN A DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM CALLED RELEVANT. AND THIS MAY NOT SOUND VERY EXCITING UNLESS YOUR DATA GEEK LIKE MYSELF -- BUT RELEVANT ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO SEE THE DATA. I KNOW WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT COMMUNICATOR IT WAS HARD WE WOULD GET MAYBE THIRTY SPREADSHEETS A MONTH FROM PARTNERSHIP AND WE WERE TRYING TO MATCH THE SPREADSHEETS ABOUT WHO THE MEMBERS WERE. WHO NEEDED THE IMMUNIZATIONS WHO NEEDED THEIR CALL IT'S REALLY HARD TO DRILL DOWN TO THAT DATA? AND NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT HAS ACTIONABLE. LIVE DATA THERE'S A DOWNLOAD EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WERE ABLE TO DRILL DOWN TO THE PATIENT AND PROVIDER LEVEL -- WE WORKING CARE TEAM SO ACTUALLY THAT DATA IS -- WHAT I CALL DEMOCRATIZED MEANING THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT AND IT'S TRANSPARENT? AND I THINK THIS IS A CULTURE SHIFT FOR US -- WELL WE APPRECIATE -- PARTNERSHIPS EFFORT TO DO A LOT OF TRAINING I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOUNDATIONAL IN TERMS OF US DEVELOPING. A CULTURE OF QUALITY WE'VE NOW SORT OF TAKEN IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. AND ULTIMATELY IT HAS TO DO WITH EVERYONE ON THE CARE TEAM REALLY FEELING INVESTED IN IN THIS CULTURAL QUALITY -- ARE CARE TEAMS WORK ON STANDING ORDERS THEY ACTUALLY CAN LOOK AT THAT OUR SYSTEM AND THEY CAN SAY WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE DUE FOR VACCINATIONS AND THEY'RE GOING. TO YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE TWO NEXT MONTH SO WE BETTER GET A MAN NEXT WEEK -- AND THIS IS NOT THE POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE VISIT THIS IS NOT ME DOCTOR MARSHALL SEEING A PATIENT AND TRYING TO DECIDE EVERYTHING THAT MY PATIENT NEEDS ALTHOUGH WE DO THAT. TOO THIS IS ALSO OUT REACH THIS IS TRUE POP IT'S INTERESTING I JUST WANNA TELL A QUICK STORY ABOUT THAT SO -- COMMUNICATOR AND I'VE TOLD THIS TO BOB ALREADY I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THIS -- COMMUNICATOR ACTUALLY MET ALL OF OUR CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES -- AND MOST OF THOSE ARE AT THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE FOR HE DOES -- SO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR POPULATION WE DON'T TURN ANYONE AWAY -- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE WEST SACRAMENTO JUST ACROSS THE RIVER WHERE WE HAVE VERY COMPLEX PATIENTS. AND WE MET ALL OF OUR CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES WE WERE LACKING ONE ONE PATIENT ONE MEASURE ONE CLINIC. AND OUR CLINIC MANAGER BIANCA. WAS AT HOME TAKING CARE FOR SICK CHILD READ AMMONIA. AND DECIDED THAT WHILE HER CHILD WAS NAPPING SHE WAS GOING TO ACTUALLY GO ON TO RELEVANT AND LOOK THROUGH THE LIST ONE MORE TIME JUST TO SEE. AND SHE FOUND A PATIENT THAT SHE HAD TAKEN CARE OF WHEN SHE WAS SERVING AS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT AT COMMUNICATOR. WHO OFTEN WENT BY HER MAIDEN NAME? AND HAD JUST BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE SHE HAD TAKEN CARE FOR AND SO SHE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORD AND SHE FOUND THAT LAST LOSS COULD BE. ALLOWING US TO ACHIEVE THAT LAST MEASURE. AND REALLY I MEAN I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE THE WORKING FOR IS THAT EVERYONE REALLY CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT WE WE DELIVER PATIENCE. I'M. JUST TO JUST TO WRAP THINGS UP I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES. BECAUSE A COMMUNICATOR EVEN THOUGH WE ARE A TOP PERFORMER QUALITY OR NOT A TOP PERFORMER ACROSS THE BOARD. WERE TOP PERFORMER IN PARTNERSHIPS -- QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF OUR OTHER PATIENTS THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE SAME MEASURES THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE. AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH WE DON'T HAVE FOR TO DELIVER. OR JUST STARTING NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA NOW THAT WE HAVE THE STATE ANALYTICS PLATFORM TO REALLY EXPLORE HOW WE CAN BETTER MEET THE CLINICAL QUALITY FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS ACROSS THE BOARD. WHETHER THEY HAVE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE WHETHER THEIR MEDICARE WHETHER THEY'RE UNINSURED -- AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING HARD ON THAT BUT I DO THINK IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] AFTER A GOOD AFTERNOON. THE CAN AND COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS THERESA CHAU I'M THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY OF INTER COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY -- AND I'M HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PRIME PROGRAM AND HOW WE'VE USED THE ALLIES THAT TORE BENEFIT AT VENTURA. I AM JOINED BY JOHNSON KILL IN THE AUDIENCE WHO IS OUR CEO FOR IN THE TRI CARE POPULATION HEALTH AND HE'S HERE REALLY TO ANSWER THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN SAVE THEM FOR HIM -- I A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF I AM FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINED -- AT THE VENTURE PROGRAM I A TEN YEARS AGO DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN DIABETES -- INTERESTINGLY IN PART BECAUSE OUR SPECIALISTS WERE NOT. INTERESTED IN DEVELOP TO IN ADDRESSING THE CHRONIC DISEASE PART OF DIABETES CARE SO AS DIABETES REALLY -- BECAME A WIDENING US ABOUT FIELD WITH MORE MEDICATIONS AND DEVICES AND OTHER MODALITIES -- IT SEEM LIKE RELEASED DEVELOPING THAT EXPERTISE MANAGEMENT WAS REALLY SOMETHING A FAMILY PHYSICIANS TO DO. SO VENTURA COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN VENTURA COUNTY AND WE ARE A MAJOR MEDICAL PROVIDER IN THE REGION -- AT THE AGENCY INCLUDE AMATEUR CARE ACUTE CARE PUBLIC HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE PLAN CALLED VENTURE CAN HEALTHCARE PLAN AND EVEN ANIMAL SERVICES. WE HAVE EIGHTEEN PRIMARY CARE SITES AS ALL SIXTEEN SPECIALTY CLINIC THAT ARE MOSTLY COLOCATED WITH THOSE PRIMARY CARE. CLINICS -- WE ALSO TO HOSPITALS -- AND I DIDN'T ADD THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES IS OFF TO PUBLIC HEALTH CLINICS. OUR CLINICS OF OVER -- EIGHTY THOUSAND MANAGEMENT CAL OF PATIENTS IN THE GOLD COAST HEALTH PLAN AND OF THE PRIMARY CARE OUTPATIENT VISITS TO OUR HEALTH SYSTEM 87% OF THEM ARE ENROLLED IN THAT MANAGEMENT HEALTH PLAN. BECAUSE COUNTY OR TO PLAN OF KNOW WE'RE NOT AT THE MOMENT WE'RE NOT NOW YOU'RE A FOR IS A COUNTY ACCOUNT ORDER. YEAH BECAUSE YEAH BUT WE'RE NOT A TO PLAN MODEL OKAY. YEAH YEAH OKAY THAT'S WHAT THE YES AND NO -- BUT THE PRIME PROGRAM A AND THE INVENTOR IS ONE OF THAT TWENTY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT PARTICIPATE IN PRIME WHICH IS PART OF ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAL WAIVER -- PRIME IS A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE -- PROGRAM WHICH IN WHICH EACH OF THE SYSTEMS TAKES ON FIFTY TO SEVENTY PERFORMANCE METRICS OVER NINE PROJECTS WHEN I BECAME THE QUALITY MEDICAL DIRECTOR IT WAS KIND OF ON THE TAIL END OF DISTRICT -- DISTRICT WAS -- IF THEY DID HAVE A QUALITY COMPONENT TO IT BUT THE AGENCIES WERE ALLOWED TO PICK THEIR OWN MEASURES IN THEIR OWN BENCHMARKS. TIME IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT WE ALL OF SAME HIGH LEVEL BENCHMARKS. ON THE INCLUDE PRIMARY SPECIALTY CARE CARE TRANSITIONS AND THERE'S A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON HIGH RISK POPULATION SUCH AS THE ONES THAT WE SERVE. IT OFFERS FROM MY CLINIC. SO THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR PRIME IS SUCH THAT YOU YOU REALLY HAVE TO MEET THE METRIC TO GET THE MONEY -- AND SO WHAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT IT ALTHOUGH IT ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY WITH WHAT WE'RE CLINICALLY INTERESTED IN DOING IN OUR SYSTEM -- IT REALLY REQUIRES YEAR OVER YEAR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN GET YOUR YOU CAN GET YOUR TO YOUR BENCHMARK FOR ONE YEAR BUT THEN THAT BENCHMARK DOES NOT STAY STAGNANT YOU HAVE TO GO ANOTHER 10% TOWARDS THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. TO GET YOUR MONEY FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO. THE MET THE BENCHMARKS OUT RISE OVER TIME AND THE FUNDING I SHE DOES DECREASE OVER THE THE A A LIFETIME OF THE PROGRAM -- SO THAT'S THE THE GAP CLOSURE MECHANISM THAT REALLY JUST ALLOWS US NOT TO I JUST REST ON OUR LAURELS BUT REALLY KIND OF CONTINUE THAT PERFORMANCE -- FOR THAT WORK HERE EVERY YEAR -- NOTABLY THE ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT PARTICIPATE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE NON FEDERAL SHARE UP FRONT TO LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL FUNDING AND THIS HAS NO IMPACT ON THE STATE GENERAL FUND. SO FOR VENTURE IN PARTICULAR PRIME FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR VISIT IT'S A IT'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR US AND IT IS REALLY HELPFUL -- IN TERMS OF GETTING ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE NEED FOR PRIVATE FOR REAL -- CLICK A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT -- WE TRY TO BE AS THAT OTHERS HAVE FOR THAN IT OF MORE THINGS MENTIONED THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA SHARING ON THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPROVE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR COUNTY. ON GETTING THAT DATA TO THE CLINICS TO AND SO THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL CUT CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE SHAUN CAREY GAPS ARE -- AND THEN TIE TRYING TO TAKE THAT TO SORT OF MORE OF AN INCENTIVE TYPE OF A ROLE THAT THE CONNECTION PLAY TO GET THERE. MEASURES IMPROVED. OF WE A NO HAVE DESIGNED A LOT OF WAYS TO HELP WITH CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN THE COUNTY WE HAVE A HIGH PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND IN MY DIMAS CLINIC I THINK EACH OF US AS CONDITIONS THINGS WE DO IS A VERY GOOD JOB RIGHT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT BEFORE PRIME WE HAD TRULY AN IDEA OF HOW WE WERE DOING THE NOT ONLY FOR OURSELVES BUT IN COMPARISON TO OTHERS. ONSO WE HAD GROUP MEDICAL VISITS VIçT EDUCATION SESSIONS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST A NUTRITIONIST ALL OF THE THINGS THAT. ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO REALLY LEVERAGE THAT DATA OUT OF THE HR. WE DID FIND THAT WOULD DO QUITE WELL IT'S IDEAS MANAGEMENT SO FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE POOR CONTROL OR HE WILL BE WITH THE OVER 9% WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE BAR. SO THIS IS ON THIS PERFORMANCE MEASURES METRIC FOR LOWER IS BETTER SO YEAR OVER YEAR WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT HOT THAT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE -- SO IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING WHICH ARE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX A LITTLE BIT BY A DOG PROVIDING MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE AND GROUP VISITS AND THESE OTHER MODALITIES REALLY DID HELP US. IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP US LOOK AT SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE TRENDS WE'RE NOT SURE -- WHY THERE IS THAT SLIGHT UPTICK IN THE PERSON AGAIN I YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE DATA FOR THIS IS THE TYPE INFORMATION WE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN SEEN TO BE ABLE TO PREEMPTIVELY? FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE. SO IF I WERE TO REALLY SPEAK TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OF A TRAP DAIS ON PRIME I WAS THE THE FIRST THING IS THE DATA YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY AGAIN AS I MENTIONED DATA POR PART. TIME -- MOST OF OUR DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGHOUT MANUAL CHART AUDITS -- AND SO WHEN WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED THE HR I NAIVELY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE JUST A PUSH OF A BUTTON AND YOU WOULD KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY DIABETIC PATIENTS YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY HOW MANY HAD ANYONE SAY OVER 9% BUT THAT'S NOT AS EASY AS WE THOUGHT SO YOU REALLY. NEED SOME EXPERTISE AT THE AT THE DATA LEVEL OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK COMPUTER LANGUAGE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SYNTHESIZED THAT DATA. AND PULL IT OUT OF THE H. ARE YOU ALSO NEED EXPERTISE FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW TO BUILD THINGS INTO YOUR EHR AND ONCE THEY BUILD IT UNDERSTAND HOW THAT GETS PULLED OUT ON THE BACK AND IS ACTUALLY USEFUL DATA US ALL THOSE PIECES ARE. LEVELS OF EXPERTISE THAT I WAS A WE DID NOT HVE A A TRIP HARD TO PRIME. AND THEN HAND IN HAND WITH THAT DATA IS A DEVELOPMENT OF QUALITY TEAM SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT THE STATE AT TRYING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL -- PERFORMANCE OF FROM THE PROJECT OUT OF THE DATAAND THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEAM DOES WITH THE INVENTORY CARE DIVISION IS TO LOOK AT THAT DATA. AND THEN GO TO THE CLINICS AND DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES -- AND AGAIN THAT IS SUPPORTED BY SHOWING EVERYBODY THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE. AND WITH THAT DATA WERE ABLE TO TRULY ENGAGING CARE COORDINATION SO WE HAVE NURSES AND MEDICAL ASSISTANTS AT THE CLINICS THAT TAKE THAT LISTED THEY THEN CALL PATIENTS WHO HAVE NOT HAD THEIR COLOR TO CANCER SCREENING HAVE NOT HAD THE FLU SHOT -- AND BRING THOSE FOLKS AND FOR THAT CARE KNOWINGLY WHO HAS THOSE NEEDS -- AND THAT THE OUTRAGE CAN BE FOCUSED ON THOSE PATIENTS OF RATHER THAN HAVING A HEALTH FOR WHERE YOU INVITE EVERYBODY TO COME AND GET A FLU SHOT -- IN THIS OF FLU FIT EVENT WHAT WE DID WAS WE CALLED ALL THE PATIENTS THAT WE KNEW ALREADY HAD NOT HAD FLU SHOTS. AND WE ALSO FOCUS ON THOSE PEOPLE AND MADE OVER FIFTY WOULD NOT HAD COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING SO THIS IS MY CLINIC. HOLDING BY THOSE WEEKEND EVENTS AND BRING PEOPLE IN TO TRY TO DEMYSTIFY. THE COLLECTION OF STILL SAMPLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF SCREENING FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. PRESS ALSO HELPED US A REALLY COORDINATOR EFFORTS WITH OTHER ARMS AGENCY LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND BY WAY OF EXAMPLE MENTIONED THAT. TOBACCO CESSATION COUNSELING USED TO BE A DOCTOR JUST TELLING A PATIENT QUIT SMOKING AND THAT RIGHT THAT AND THE NARRATIVE AND THEY WOULD ASK ME WHY I COULDN'T CAPTURE THAT DATA. AND I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT THE DATA A DOCUMENTATIONS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF COLLECTING DATA -- AND WHAT WE DO NOW IS WE TRAIN OUR STAFF TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE THAT COUNSELING BUT THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC REFERRAL BUTTON IN. THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THAT GOES STRAIGHT -- TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH OR REACH OUT TO THE PATIENT SIGN THEM UP FOR A TOBACCO CESSATION CLASS. FOR THAT TYPE OF AUTOMOTIVE CITY MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO PARTNER WITH OUR WITH OTHER ON TO THE AGENCIES -- TO HELP THE PATIENT WITH THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. SENDING ADOLESCENTS ADULTS FOR A ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON THAT AGAIN WAS NOT DONE ON A SYSTEMATIC. AGENCY WIDE LEVEL -- AND SO THAT IS -- IF A PATIENT DOES NEED SOME EXTRA HELP WE PARTNER WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THAT REFERRAL. SO COLORFUL CANCER SCREENING -- IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY WERE PERFORMING QUITE POORLY NEEDED -- TO IT TO DO MANY THINGS TO TRY TO GET THAT IMPROVED I I MENTIONED AGAIN -- OUTRAGE I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF IT HAVING THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK THIS DATA SHOWS YOU THAT WE'RE NOW UP INITIAL PERFORMANCE AND REALLY IT REFLECTS DOING OVER FOUR THOUSAND MORE FIT TESTS PER YEAR. AND SAVING A PEOPLE FROM DYING FROM CANCER SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY PRIME REALLY HAS HELPED US DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- INVENTOR COUNTY I THINK WE WERE BEHIND IN OUR QUALITY WORK TRUTHFULLY WHEN THIS STARTED I THINK WE'VE REALLY CAUGHT UP. BUT THAT WAS -- IN LARGE PART DUE TO THIS WHERE WE HAVE FROM THE PROGRAM AND MISTREATMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT VERY MUCH -- MY NAME IS BEAU HANNON I'M DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PART OF OUR OUR CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL PLAN -- IN MY ROLE IN OUR SPECIAL PROGRAMS I'VE OVERSIGHT FOR SEVERAL STATE PROGRAMS AND AND BENEFITS INCLUDING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS -- OUR OUR PALLIATIVE CARE BENEFIT -- SOME EFFORTS WERE DOING WITH WITH SEVERAL ARE COUNTIES AROUND THE THEY COUNTY WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS -- ALSO SOME MORE GROUND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN IN BIGGEST THING THAT I'M HERE TALK ABOUT TODAY IS IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S HELP HOMES PROGRAM -- SO THE STATE'S OLD HOMES PROGRAM. NO IS A A NEW PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S REALLY JUST GETTING STARTED -- IT WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THREE SECTION TWENTY SEVEN OH THREE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIXTY ONE HEARING CALIFORNIA SEVERAL YEARS BACK -- WHICH WHICH REALLY ALLOWED HEALTH PLANS TO BUILD THIS NEW CASE MANAGEMENT CARE COORDINATION PROGRAM -- DATES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE -- COMPARED TO OTHER COMPOUND COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE OPERATED AT THE HEALTH PLAN SYSTEM -- THERE IS FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S A 90% FEDERAL MATCH FOR FOR THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF THE PROGRAM. IN CURRENTLY UNDER STATE LAW THERE'S A AN AGREEMENT WITH CALIFORNIAN DOWN THAT TO TO COVER THE OTHER 10% FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SO THAT'S A A SHORT WINDOW WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP TODAY IS TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IS IS NOT A LOT. OF TIME TO STAND UP A PROGRAM AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE SEE THE SUCCESSFUL IMPACT WE'RE ANTICIPATING SEEING -- YOU KNOW THE THING THAT MAKES THIS PROGRAM UNIQUE IS. IN OR DOES TARGET INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS -- AND AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS -- BUT THESE ARE ARE TYPICALLY INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING -- THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DISENGAGE FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THEY'VE THEY'VE TYPICALLY NOT BEEN GOING TO GET PRIMARY CARE -- YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF THEIR CARE IS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS OR IN THE INPATIENT SETTING -- AND AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH BECAUSE RATHER THAN US AS THE HEALTH PLAN TRYING TO REACH OUT AND GAUGES MEMBERS OR OR JUST. SOLELY TRYING TO RELY ON THEIR PC P. TO ENGAGE THEM WORKING IN PARTNERING CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED CLINICS FQHCS ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTERS -- TO REALLY BE THERE ARE THERE ARE PERSON CENTER MEDICAL HOME AND AND REALLY PROVIDE THE INTEGRATED CARE COORDINATION THAT THAT THIS THIS POPULATION NEEDS -- AND SO YOU KNOW IT DOES THERE IS A DEFINITELY A LOT MORE FOCUS ON ON OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT -- YOU KNOW ONCE MEMBERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE PRO -- GOING OUT ON THE STREETS IN THE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS CONNECTING WITH THE LOCAL HOSPITALS TRYING TO FIND A MEMBER WHEREVER THEY CAN AND AND REALLY SPENDING -- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME INVESTED IN IN -- IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT MEMBER SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF HEY THIS PERSON'S ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM GET THEM ENROLLED ANOTHER LIKE SKINNER GOING TO BE BETTER. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SPEND SOMETIMES TWO THREE MONTHS. GETTING BUILDING A A LAYER OF TRUST WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL AND AND SO THAT THEY CAN START TO FULLY ENGAGE IN THEIR CARE -- ADAM WAS WAS ONE OF TWO HEALTH PLANS TO TO GO LIVE IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROGRAM IN JULY OF THIS YEAR IN SAN FRANCISCO ALTHOUGH I WILL CALL OUT THAT OTHER PLANTS WHICH IS. HIS PARTNERSHIP AND DOC MORE OF HAD OTHER PILOTS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- IN ROLLING IT OUT IN SIX ADDITIONAL COUNTIES IN IN JULY OF THIS YEAR INCLUDING. SACRAMENTO SANTA CLARA -- SACRAMENTO SANTA CLARA FRESNO TULARE LOS ANGELES AND ALAMEDA COUNTY -- BUT YOU KNOW I I THINK. WE'RE WE'VE ALSO DONE THIS IN IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES -- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODELS BUT BUT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED HEALTH PROBLEMS PROBE HEALTH FUNDS PROGRAMS AND OTHER STATES AND AND YOU KNOW IN THE LONG TERM YOU KNOW WE DO FEEL THAT THIS IS THIS IS BRING IN -- AND A NEW LAYER OF BENEFIT TO THE HARD TO SERVE MEMBERS IT IS MAKING BIG IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR LIVES -- WE DO STE ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE LONG TERM WE ARE GOING TO START SEEING MORE MORE COST SAVINGS AND REDUCTIONS IN THE NEW YEAR NECESSARY UTILIZATION IS IS WE'RE GETTING THESE MEMBERS RECONNECTED TO THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- BUT IN THE SHORT TERM THERE ARE THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME -- THE THE PROGRAM. DOES REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF START UP EFFORT NOT JUST FROM THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL I MEAN IT'S IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK FOR US AT THE HEALTH PLAN. BUT I THINK IT'S EVEN A BIGGER BURDEN ON THE LOCAL CLINICS --% YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CLINICS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW THESE SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A VARIETY OF WORKING WITH CLINICS LIKE THE WELL SPACE CLINICS WHO HAVE PROGRAMS IN STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME ON BOARD QUICKLY WE HAVE OTHER CLINICS WHICH YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL ON BOARD THEY SEE A LOT OF VALUE IN THIS THEY WANT. TO CHANGE THEIR SYSTEM TO TO SERVE THIS PROGRAM BUT IT'S AN EXTREMELY HEAVY LEFT. AND SO IT IT IT DOES BECOME A BURDEN TO START UP THE PROGRAM -- ALSO IT'S A VERY SLOW STARTING PROGRAM IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT ONE THAT YOU KNOW DAY ONE WERE WERE ROLLING OUT AND WE'VE GOT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS RECEIVING THE BENEFIT -- SO SO YOU KNOW JUST TO OUT OF SUCCESS WE'VE SEEN STORIES COME WE'RE SEEING THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING ON THEIR LIVES -- BUT YOU KNOW IT DOES NEED WE DO NEED TO MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM AND WE DO HAVE OTHER COUNTIES. TO ARE NOT PART OF OF THE THE IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE NEXT YEAR -- REQUIRING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE THE SERVICES EXPANDED TO THEM AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM. SO I JUST THE FOR SO I GO I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR PRESENTING AT EIGHT I GUESS -- THIS IS A QUESTION -- FOR A DOCTOR CHAU -- SO YOU PRESENTED ACTUALLY YOU PRESENTED TO EXAMPLES ONE THE AYE COLORECTAL YOU GOT A LOT MORE PEOPLE TO GET SCREEN THAT LOOK REALLY GREAT. THE OTHER ONE ON THE DIABETES SO WELL SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU'RE A PERFORMING SO WELL THAT YOU KNOW THE BENCHMARK IS COMING DOWN YOU'RE FAR AWAY FROM IT. BUT I ALSO NOTE THAT. YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU TO PERFORMANCE THAT YOU HAD OVER THE FOUR YEARS. BASICALLY YOU KNOW THERE'S A CELL THAT AND ONE THOUSAND AND DISOBEYED Là BASICALLY NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED OVER THAT FOR YEARS. IF THE VENTURE CAPITAL V. WHERE YOU WERE THAT MY BEEN. FOR A VERY PROBLEMATIC AND MAYBE MAYBE YOU MAXED OUT -- HOW MUCH CHANGE YOU COULD MAKE AT YOUR PROVIDER IS SO HIGH PERFORMING COULD SQUEEZE ANYMORE OUT OF IT BUT? CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT I MEAN IT'S IT'S THEIR ARE YOU JUST LIKE -- WE WERE SWEET WE DID DOING EVERYTHING SO WELL WE DID WE JUST KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING OR WAS THERE ACTUALLY WELL WE TRY TO DO SOME STUFF IT'LL BUT ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T SEE A BEND IN THE CAR AND AND AND THEIR PERFORMANCE CURVE. I I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH TUNA AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WE A LOT RIGHT AROUND WHEN DAD ARE NO NUMBER SIR TO GO UP ON THE DIABETES IS WHEN WE HAD AND IT ANOTHER PROGRAM WHICH I I DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT WHICH IS Q.I. P. -- AND THAT ADDED ANOTHER TWENTY SIX QUALITY MEASURES TO THE ONES WE WERE ALREADY LOOKING AT I THINK THAT IT SORT OF SPEAKS -- TO IT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN LEVERAGE AT THE CLINIC LEVEL YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL VERY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES AND SO TO GO AND TO TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR EYE ON EVERY SINGLE BALL. AT ONE TIME IS VERY DIFFICULT SO I DO AGREE THAT TO SOME EXTENT WE HAD BIGGER FISH TO FRY SO THE DIABETES THING BECAME SENATE SOMEONE THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE WE WERE IS DOING WELL ON IT. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY COST FOR CONCERN BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN UP TICK THERE IN THE PERCENT THAT ARE OVER 9%. I DO ALSO THINK THAT WE YOU KNOW WITH THE DATA HAS ALLOWED US TO LOOK AT AT TRI CRITICALLY TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE IS THAT I'VE TAKEN WE DO FIND THAT. INNER LATINO PATIENTS THEY ARE ABOUT 5% HIGHER IN TERMS OF THAT UNCONTROLLED DIABETES RATE AND SO WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT AGAIN BY CARE COORDINATION BUT ALSO. OUR GROUP MEDICAL VISITS ARE HEAVILY. WEIGHTED FOR THE LATINO POPULATION WE HAVE A 75% OF THEM ARE IN SPANISH SO WE DID TRY. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND ADDRESS THAT MAYBE THAT WASN'T ENOUGH IT'S A HARD AND EARLY TO TELL. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- FOR PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN A CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER SO WE NEED MAYOR OF YOUR MAYBE OUT ON SO MUCH OF THE FINANCIAL SIDE WE HEARD PREVIOUSLY FROM CALIFORNIA A STRIPPER OWN ABOUT THE PREMIUM SLIGHT ISSUE. THIS FOR THIS WAY I KNOW THAT THE HEALTH PLAN IS ALWAYS AND THEN PART OF IT'S IN MY DISTRICT IS ALWAYS WORKING TO TRY YEAH WHATEVER -- BUT SAME TIME THAT DOES CREATE A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE IS. IS DO YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND IS IF WE COULD ELIMINATE THE PREMIUMS SLIDE WITH THAT HELP PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR THE HEALTH PLAN TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE. INNOVATION. AND ANY SORT FOCUS MY REMARKS ON P. FOR P. I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT MORE INTEGRATION ACO TYPE STUFF. IT SOME OF IT MAY BE P. FOR P. BUT I MEAN BEYOND THAT BUT I MEAN DO YOU DO THAT FINANCIALLY I MEAN TO DO ARE THERE SOME OF I MEAN ARE YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE. YOU OF LIFE SAFETY OF ALL THE MONEY YOU NEED BUT BASICALLY IF YOU HAD MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCE ARE A BASICALLY YOU HAD A BETTER FINANCIAL INCENTIVE WOULD THAT CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR HEALTH PLAN OR YOU CAN LIKE NO WE RE DID WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO READY. AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARY -- YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS LIGHT IS IS A REAL ISSUE THERE IS ONE SLIGHT BUFFER ON THAT WHICH IS THAT IF YOU SAVE MONEY IN ONE YEAR IT TAKES A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE YOU LOSE IT SO YOU GET A TRANSIENT BENEFITS IS NOT A LONG TERM BUT THAT TRANSIT BENEFIT. TO STILL SOME SOME FINANCIAL BENEFIT -- A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT PREVIOUS LIGHT IS THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM THE ASIAN CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A SORT OF A HEALTH HOMES LIKE PROGRAM -- WE WE ARE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS SHOWS A FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND WE SAVED ABOUT -- TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS ON AVERAGE ACROSS THAT PERIOD BUT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT'S ALREADY BUILT BUILT INTO OUR RATES WHICH OF YOU KNOW GOING DOWN AS RESULT OF THAT SO. SO IF WE STOPPED IT THINGS WOULD NOW WE LOSE MONEY YOU KNOW SO THAT WOULD BE A BAD THING SO THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD BECAUSE IT REDUCES HOSPITALIZATION AND SO ON SO -- SO WE ARE NUMBER PROGRAMS ARE -- THAT ARE THAT ARE LIKE THAT AND THE PALETTE OF KERR PROGRAMS ANTHER EXAMPLE THAT -- PALETTE OF KERR WAS IMPLEMENTED. WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM DHS BECAUSE OF THE WEB PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE DID A PARTNERSHIP SHOWING THAT ABOUT A THREE TO ONE OF SAY IS THREE DOLLARS SAY FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT ON PALLIATIVE CARE SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY. AGAIN THAT THAT GETS THAT THE MONEY THAT SAVE FROM INCREASING PALETTE OF KERR IS THERE FOR SHORTER TIME THEN IT GOES AWAY SO. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AND DOWN TO THE EXTENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT ANY MONEY THAT'S LEFT THAT WE HAVE IS IS REINVESTED RECENTLY INVESTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN VARIOUS -- SYNERGISTIC LIVES WE RESET WE SUPPORTED -- WE ACTUALLY ARE SUPPORTING THREE DIFFERENT -- TRANSITIONS PROGRAMS FROM FROM A CAR BEING INCARCERATED TO BEING BACK OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO TO DECREASE HOSPITAL EXPENSES THERE -- THAT WE WE HAVE A UP FOR A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING ON A SOBRE US WITH THE CALL SOBRE CENTERS RETARDED -- SOBER SOBER LIVING SO THEIR INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT THAT MONEY HAD TO COME FROM THE THE MONEY WE SAVE FROM SOMEWHERE THAT THE READ THAT THAT THAT WASN'T BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA GET REIMBURSED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS FROM THE STATE SO BUT THEN. THE QUESTION IS IT WHEN THAT EXTRA MONEY GOES AWAY WOULD DO TO YOU KNOW DO WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT ARE OR HOW MUCH CAN WE DO THAT AND IT EVENTUALLY REACH A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO SO. AND THEN ON THE HEALTH HOMES -- REPRESENT RECORD SO ONE TWO WEEKS SO EASE THAT ARE DO YOU HAVE DATA YET WHEN YOU EXPECTING MY HAVE SOME DATA ABOUT THE ABOUT. HOW MUCH IMPROVEMENT YOU BAIL MADE WITH THIS PROGRAM? YEAH I I I THINK YOU KNOW LOOKING AT UTILIZATION DATA. YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE WE'RE STARTING TOGETHER THAT NOW AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW BY THE END OF THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD IDEA BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED NOW. YOU KNOW A I THINK THERE WERE WERE SOME ASSUMPTIONS MADE THAT THAT THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS WOULD COME IN REALLY REALLY QUICK SO WE'LL HAVE SOME EVALUATION DATA THAT SAYS ON A PER MEMBER BASE IS A SERVICE FAVES THIS BUT IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE PROGRAM WHY WHAT'S. THE BIG IMPACT THIS IS HAVING AND I THINK EVEN EVEN THE WAY THE THE RATES ARE STRUCTURED NOW THERE WERE SOME ASSUMPTIONS MADE THAT. YOU KNOW ALL THE ENROLLMENT WOULD OCCUR WITHIN THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS AND THEN HEALTH WOOD DRASTICALLY IMPROVED BY THE SECOND TWELVE MONTHS AND SO THEIR SHIPS AND RATES IN THE SECOND YEAR. AND WE'RE FINDING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY GET PEOPLE INTO THE PROGRAM -- ACTUALLY TAKES OVER A REALLY LONG TIME AND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE NOT JUST FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT IS WE HAVE OTHER YOU KNOW NEW MEMBERS WHO WERE GOING TO FALL INTO THE ELIGIBILITY PUCK. YEAH I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE SIZE UNDERESTIMATE. HOW MUCH EFFORT TAKES TO MAKE CHANGE AND -- PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN AND KNOW SOME OF YOU HERE RANK CLASS HE SORT. OF SO INCOMES THESE AS WE WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU DO THINGS RIGHT WHETHER IT'S OF THE MAIN H. R. L. CHANGING QUALITY AND AND THAT THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION. I MEAN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE DOING AND THE TEAM WE TALK ABOUT TEAM BASED CARE EVERYONE HAS A ROLE OF READY IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO. AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING THINGS TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW DO YOU REINFORCE THE NEW WAY INTO THE TRAINING AND BE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT. BY THEN HEY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT A REALLY FAST SIX MONTHS GOT BY RIGHT. A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AND I THINK WE NEED TO WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS WE ALSO NEED. TO FIGURED OUT OUT TO AN AND HAVE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS. WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE HEARING ABOUT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING THANK YOU SO MUCH? OKAY SO NEXT UP WE HAVE THE FARM HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND I WANNA THANK -- DIPPY DIRECTOR A MERRY CAN'T WELL AND ALSO G. C. COOPER SENIOR ADVISER HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND THEN -- SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE I GUESS -- IN YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE PREPARED SOME REMARKS BUT I ADDRESS THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THINGS THAT CAME UP EARLIER IN THE HEARING IF TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE ALIGNMENT OF MODELS AND MEASURES AND SO FORTH AND HOW MEDI CAL FITS AND I NOTES ITS SIZE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT POPULATION SOME WAYS. YOU KNOW IT'S LOW INCOME ETCETERA. AND BUT HOW US THE PERHAPS IT DOES -- SOME COMMENTS ABOUT HOW -- MEDI CAL CAN FIT INTO THIS BARTER SYSTEM WE HEARD A QUESTION ABOUT ALSO ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN DATA FOR THAT WITHIN A GREAT HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION SO. WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR THINGS DOCTOR PAN -- ASSUME -- YOUR STAFF DID HAVE A FEW TOPICS THAT THEY ASKED US TO TALK ABOUT SO -- WILL THERE WERE THREE SORT OF SPECIFIC ONES ALL TALK ABOUT TO THEM AND THEN -- GZ COOPER WILL WILL FOLLOW UP AND THEN I THINK WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I KNOW YOU HAVE AND STUFF THAT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN RISEN SO -- SO THE FIRST THE FIRST TOPIC AREA WOULD RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING PROPOSAL AND JUST SORT OF MORE ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT TOTALLY REASONABLE -- WE DON'T HAVE A TON MORE RIGHT NOW WE STAKEHOLDER IN LEGISLATIVE INPUT THE DETAILS AROUND WHAT METRICS WE'RE LOOKING AT AND HOW WE'RE THINKING OF PAYING AND WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE -- I THINK AS AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHARED SO FAR AS WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON FOUR AREAS. A PRENATAL CARE AND POST PARTUM CARE -- EARLY CHILDHOOD WELLNESS IMMUNIZATIONS. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS A CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND THEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION SO THAT'S WHERE THE MEASURES ARE FOCUS AND CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO BE. HOPING AND EXPECTING THAT FOLKS CAN HELP US SORT OF REFINE THAT AND AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE SENSE I THINK AS SOME OF THE PANEL MEMBERS. EARLIER MENTIONED WHEN YOU GET TO VALUE BASED PAYMENT AND YOU GO DOWN TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL IT CAN BE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF ARE THERE ENOUGH -- DENOMINATOR OF PATIENTS TO BE HAVING A METRIC ON AND SO YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES WHEN WE RELEASED THE PROPOSAL AND CERTAINLY WILL BE -- HAPPY TO HAVE YOUR FEEDBACK AS WELL AS A PHYSICIAN WHO OPERATED IN IN OUR PROGRAM TO SORT OF KNOW ARE WE HEADING IN THE RIGHT MARK PARTICULARLY ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD STUFF. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR THAT -- WILL CERTAINLY GET THAT OUT WILL BE HAVING A WEAPON ARE. AS WELL AND SEEKING -- HAVING A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO THEN SERVER FOR THE WHOLE BUDGET PROCESS AS WE GO THROUGH ASSUMING THAT. CONTINUES TO BE A PART OF THE BUDGET THAT. EVERYONE AGO SHEETS WITH THE GOVERNOR -- BUT ONE OF THE OTHER TOPICS THAT YOU ASKED US TO ADDRESS REALLY RELATES TO HOW DO WE MEASURE COST AND QUALITY AND I THINK WE'VE. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT -- WITH YOU SO JUST TO TOUCH AT A HIGH LEVEL I THINK YOU HEARD A LOT OF A LOT OF IT ALREADY IN TERMS OF WHAT. THE FOUNDATION TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF OUR PLANS BUT WE DO HAVE A SET OF THE X. THE THE A. S. EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET THAT WE MEASURE THAT DOES CHANGE EVERY YEAR OF WHICH YOU KNOW WE DO. WORK WITH OUR MANAGER CALL THE ADVISORY GROUP TO DETERMINE WHICH MEASURES MAKE THE MOST SENSE TRY TO HAVE STABILITY BUT ALSO MAKE SURE IF THERE'S SOMETHING. SORT OF IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING OR SOMETHING WE'RE NOT DOING. REALLY WELL AND THAT WE FOCUS ON THAT WE DO HAVE FOR THE REPORTING YOUR TWENTY NINETEEN I BELIEVE THERE SEVENTEEN MEASURES WITH. I THINK TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS TOTAL SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- YOU KNOW SORT OF SPANNING SOME OF THE DIABETES STUFF THEY SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS TALK ABOUT. SO WE DO HAVE THAT THAT WE HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE -- TO YOU HEARD A CHRIS TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE DASHBOARDS THAT WE PUT OUT THAT I KNOW WE'VE SHARED AND TALK ABOUT WITH YOU BEFORE -- I THINK AS MANY FOLKS OF MENTION WE SIR WE HAVE CERTAINLY RAMPED UP OUR EFFORTS IN THIS AREA -- IN WAYS THAT I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF AND I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY BEEN TRUE OVER THAT. THE TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE REALLY SEEING A SHIFT IN FOCUSING ON NOT ONLY MONITORING AND TRACKING THE QUALITY BUT REALLY BEING ABLE TO SHARE THAT OUT SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THAT AND HAVE FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE DOING WELL AND WHERE WE MAY BE STRUGGLING AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CORRECT THAT AND SO. USING THAT THOSE DATA WE DO WORK WITH OUR PLANS AND AGAIN YOU HEARD FOLKS TALK ABOUT THEIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AT THE REQUIRED TO DO -- AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR MEETING THOSE THOSE METRICS OBVIOUSLY WHEN PLANS ARE NOT. BUT PERFORMING TO THE THE STANDARD THAT WE SET WE DO WE HAVE BEGUN ISSUING SANCTIONS I THINK. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE US USE THAT AS A TOOL WE HAVE SEEN I THINK -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT BE VERY USEFUL. IN CORRECTING ISSUES -- SO NOT THAT WE LIKE TO PENALIZE. PLEASE PEOPLE BUT IN TERMS OF IT REALLY BECAUSE START GETTING ATTENTION OF OF LEADERSHIP IN THOSE VARIOUS AREAS TEND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE -- IT SO IF YOU KNOW FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE WE DID AS YOU MENTIONED YOU HAD THE COSTA. BECOMES RATE SETTING -- A HEARING LAST YEAR I THINK I FEELS LIKE EVERY YEAR WHO WHO NOT SOMETIME -- AND SO WE DO OBVIOUSLY IT CAPTURE THE COST INFORMATION I THINK AS AS AS FOLKS TALKED ABOUT IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS YOU MENTIONED AND OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MANAGED CARE AND -- REALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HEAVILY CAPITATED NATURE EVEN NOT JUST US TO THE PLANS BUT AS YOU KNOW PLANS TO PROVIDER GROUPS AND AND OTHER. DELEGATED ENTITIES AND SO REALLY IT'S A VERY HEAVILY DELEGATED A CAPITATED SYSTEM AND NOT A FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- AND SO IT SO THAT'S WHY THAT INFORMATION ON TO ABOUT PER SERVICE COST ISN'T AVAILABLE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW ANYONE'S PAID BUT SERVE OVERALL OBVIOUSLY WE TRACK COST AND WE DO DO A FEW THINGS IN THE RIGHT SETTING THAT THAT WE SHARED FOR IN TERMS OF SOME OFFICIALS THE ADJUSTMENTS. RELATED TO PHARMACY AND POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE ADMISSIONS -- TO TRY TO DRIVE SOME OF THAT THAT BUT CERTAIN BENCHMARKS OF OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE BEING ANSWERED MOST EFFICIENT IN IN THOSE AREAS AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS -- TO FURTHER THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE MORE VALUE. AND I THINK -- BLESSING I'D SAY BEFORE TURNING OVER CITY SEE BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT THE END OF THIS WAIVER AND SORT OF THE START OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW MUCH HOW CAN HOW CAN WE PUSH MORE CHANGE IN HOW WE CAN WE FOCUS MORE ON VALUE IN QUALITY? AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE WILL TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE AREAS WERE THINKING ABOUT AND CERTAINLY WORKING WITH FOLKS ON ON THOSE IDEAS AS WE GO THROUGH SORT OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY. THANK YOU WILLOW GOOD AFTERNOON -- SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE WERE -- WE'RE CONVERSATIONS EARLIER AROUND STRATEGIES AND THINGS WE CAN IMPLEMENT TO IMPROVE CARE COORDINATION AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT I THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS OUR MAIN GOALS IS TO AS MENTIONED BEFORE ENSURE THAT ANY BENEFICIARY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE RECEIVING CARE IN THE STATE IS GETTING CONSISTENT CARE -- AND THAT IS PREDICTABLE -- AND THAT THAT CARE DOESN'T CHANGE THAT THEIR HEALTH OUTCOME JUST BY BASED ON WHERE THEY LIVE -- AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES. TO EXPLORE FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN WHICH MEANT AMEND TODAY ALL WALK THROUGH THREE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO -- SO THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE LOOKING INTO IDENTIFYING MEMBER RISK IN NEED THROUGH MORE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. ON THE SECOND ONE IS REDUCING VARIATION AND COMPLEXITY ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THE LAST ONE IS LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING INCENTIVES -- THAT WOULD IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN SUPPORT VALUE BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE SHARED SAVINGS MODELS SO GO INTO EACH OF THOSE THREE ITEMS A QUICKLY -- SO AS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THE FIRST ONE REALLY BEING AT HOW DO WE BETTER IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THE SERVICES. I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK AT OUR CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS IN LANGUAGE TO SEE HOW CAN WE TIGHTEN UP -- LANGUAGE AROUND CARE COORDINATION DISEASE ON CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE IT IS APPROPRIATE MAKE SHIRTS MEASURABLE -- AND TO ENSURE THAT DATA ANALYTICS ARE BEING USED TO DRIVE CLINICAL DCISION MAKING -- SPECIFICALLY AROUND HOW WE IDENTIFY TARGET POPULATIONS WITHIN -- THE PLANS AND THEN HOW INTERVENTIONS ARE BEING TIED TO THOSE POPULATIONS AND HEALTH PLANS ARE INCENTIVIZING NOW ON THE DOWNSTREAM TO THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK AT THE CONTRACT. WHERE YOU DO SEE A DOCTOR MORE TODAY GIVE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF PLANS DOING THAT -- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TO LOOK AT THE CAR CROSS THE STATE FOR SOME PLANS ARE THAT AND SOME ARE NOT -- AND SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION AND TO PROVIDE. RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT AREA -- THE OTHER THING IS WE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT OUR PROCESSES FOR HOW WE CURRENTLY SCREEN AND ASSESS SCHOOL RISKY NEED AS WELL AS LOOKING AT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH -- TO BETTER TARGET APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS -- FOR OUR MEDICARE POPULATION I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY OUR POPULATION IS MAYBE DIFFERENT -- THEN ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS TODAY -- AND THERE ARE UNIQUE INTERVENTIONS THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED -- AND THAT GETS TO THE THE LARGER THOUGH THE LAST PART OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE IDENTIFYING USING DATA ANALYSTS TO DRIVE WHO ARE THE TARGET POPULATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THIS CARE WHO ARE HIGH RISK -- ARE THE HIGH NEED POPULATIONS -- BUT THEN THERE'S THE INTERVENTION PARDON TO THE DEPARTMENT DOES KNOW THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES. UP HERE -- YOU HEARD SOME AMAZING THINGS ARE CARE COORDINATION HANSEN SAID FOR US TO LOOK AT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AROUND EVEN SOLUTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS OF A CLINIC -- WE HAVE SEEN GREAT -- INNOVATIONS IN WHOLE PERSON CARE -- SOME VERY GREAT THINGS IN A PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO REACHING OUT TO INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS OF THE CLINIC. INTO THE COMMUNITY -- WE'VE SEEN VERY EFFECTIVE USE OF THAT THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE I'M AND HOW DO WE SKILLED THAT UP NOT JUST TO HOLD PERSON CARE -- LEAD ENTITIES -- BUT ACROSS ACROSS OUR MEDI CAL POPULATION -- IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE LEE -- HOUSING LIAISON SERVICES POST INCARCERATION PEER SUPPORT A VARIETY OF INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK ARE VERY PROMISING TO LOOK AT FOR FUTURE. OPPORTUNITIES -- AS OF RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN COUNTIES -- AND SO THE IDEA WAS BE HOW WOULD WE BE ABLE TO HIGHER STATE FOR HE'S AROUND IN LIEU OF SERVICES SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IN LIEU OF SERVICES -- TO IDENTIFIED MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE -- SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE ABLE TO SUBSTITUTE EXISTING STATE PLAN BENEFITS -- ONE VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS RECRUITED OF CARE SO -- A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS HAVE IMPLEMENTED RECUPERATIVE CARE. IN IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE IN ORDER TO GET SOMEONE WHO MAY BE HOMELESS WHO'S IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM AN INPATIENT SETTING. OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT IN INTO A LOWER LEVEL BUT NOT GOING TO THE STREETS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE STABLE HOUSING LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND THEM SOMEWHERE TO GO SAFELY -- FOR WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME IS NECESSARY -- TO TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES THERE SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE LOOK AT THE WAIVER RENEWAL AND WE LEARN FROM THESE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS ABOUT WHAT CAN BE SCALED UP IN WHAT WE CAN BUILD WITHIN THE THE CONFINES OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THE NEXT ONE IS LOOKING AT REDUCING VARIATION IN COMPLEX A COMPLEXITY ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- SO AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE CARE COORDINATION CAN BE VERY UNPREDICTABLE IF THE SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLICATED -- AND SO IT IS WHY ONE OF THE REASONS HAITIAN ACROSS CAL -- AS WAS MENTIONED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TODAY -- IF YOU'RE IN ONE COUNTY IT CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE COUNTY NEXT YOU AND SOMETIMES EVEN FROM ONE PLAN TO THE OTHER EVEN SAW THAT WITH SOME OF THE REMARKS CHRIS MADE TODAY -- SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT THERE'S THREE MAIN AREAS WHERE WE THINK WE COULD FOCUS ON THAT VARIATION. ON THE FIRST ONE IS WHERE BENEFITS ARE ADMINISTERED IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM -- SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LARGER LOOK BUT REVIEWING WHAT IS CARVED IN AND OUT OF MANAGED CARE SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE LONG TERM CARE TRANSPLANT OR OTHER LARGER THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND SHE DE OF COURSE. BUT LOOKING ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THE OTHERS IS FUNDING SILOS THAT HAVE CREATED SYSTEM DELIVERY SYSTEM IN EQUITIES -- IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE COULD REALLY LOOK INTO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TO DRIVE SOME POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES. ON THE OTHER IS ENROLLMENT IN MANAGED CARE SO -- REVIEWING EIGHT CODES POPULATIONS ZIP CODES WE STILL HAVE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE -- MANAGED CARE IS NOT THE MAIN DELIVERY SYSTEM OR THE REQUIRED DELIVERY SYSTEM -- AND LASTLY IN REGARDS TO VARIATION IS INCREASING PARITY IN THE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM SO NOT JUST ON THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. PLAN SIDE BUT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AS SHE DE INTO TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE SAME MONITORING THEN THE LAST IS LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES AROUND -- IMPLEMENTING INCENTIVES -- THAT IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN SUPPORT VALUE BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND SHARED SAVINGS MODELS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY OPEN. TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SPACE -- SPECIFICALLY AROUND THINGS LIKE PRIME YOU HEARD I TALKED ABOUT TODAY HOW DO WE TAKE PRIME WHICH HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN OUR PUBLIC AND DISTRICT HOSPITALS TO SCALE UP ACROSS THE STATE -- AS WELL AS LOOK AT MORE RISK BASED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS -- SURE SAVINGS MODELS IN OTHER RATE CHANGES SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY OPEN TO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND LOOK AT THINGS LIKE PROP FIFTY SIX AS MERRY MENTIONED OTHER DIRECTED PAYMENTS OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. FOR CREATIVE FINANCING TO DRIVE THE INTENDED OUTCOMES AND CLOSE THOSE GAPS SO. SO JUST TO BUILD ON TO THAT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY -- THE FOUNDATIONS REPORT IN TERMS OF THE SHARED SAVINGS MODEL -- AS I CAN'T MEMBER CHRISTMAS AND MENTIONED I WAS AN ADVISER ON THAT GROUP OBVIOUSLY NOT A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND NOT. PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THINK WHAT YOU WHAT YOU HEARD HIM DESCRIBE AND WHAT YOU'VE HEARD JC TALK ABOUT IS REALLY THE DIRECTION WE'RE WANTING TO GO WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITED. INCENTIVE AND AS YOU HEARD I THINK OUR PARTNERSHIP -- PLANNED DISCUSS IT'S NOT THAT THERE IS NO INCENTIVE BECAUSE THERE'S A TIME LIMITED CHAIN YOU KNOW PERIOD. BUT HOW DO WE BETTER INCENTIVIZE AND WITHOUT AND I THINK AND I APPRECIATED THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORKGROUPS WORK IN RECOGNIZING THAT THE FIRST STEP. CAN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS BE JUST PUT MORE MONEY IN THERE AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO DO THIS IN A COST NEUTRAL OR COST NEUTRAL OVER YOU KNOW. A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING STATE EXPENDITURES ARE NECESSARILY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DRIVING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES AND SO LOOKING AT AS THREE D. C. SAID LOOKING AT HOW DO WE SCALE -- EIGHT AS A PART OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS BECAUSE AGAIN IF THAT IS ARE AT THAT HAS BEEN OUR PRIMARY DELIVERY SYSTEM SO HOW DO WE RELY ON THEM. TO TO DO SOME OF THIS AND HAVE IT BE MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE. ALSO AS YOU SEE MENTION A LOT OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE STAFF WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. OBVIOUSLY WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THE WAIVER THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL BE GOING AWAY BUT WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE SUCCESSES THERE AND HOW DO WE BUILD ON THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY EXISTS. IN OUR COUNTIES AND WITH OUR PLANS AS THEIR PARTNERS -- TODAY AND HAVE THAT BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE PLAN SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THE SERVICES. THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR AND ACCOUNTED FOR AND MAKING SURE THAT THEN WE ARE SORT OF USING THE FORTIES WE CAN TO GET THE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THAT I THINK THAT YOU HAVE THAT QUESTION EARLIER OF YOU KNOW. WE WE ARE SOMETIMES LIMITED IN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BECAUSE OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW WOULD YOU RATE SETTING AND AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT AT WHAT ARE THE STORIES THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND I THINK. AGAIN DEPENDING ON OUR FEDERALIST FIFTEEN WEBER I THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP US. TO NOT HAVE SOME OF THOSE COST -- COST DRIVEN AT THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO TODAY -- AND REALLY LOOKING AT THE CONCEPT OF ALLOWING PLANS IN REQUIRING PLANS TO PROVIDE THESE SORT OF LESS COSTLY SERVICES AND THOSE BE RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THEIR RATE DEVELOPMENT AND NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE INVESTING AND THEN -- THEIR COSTS GO DOWN AND THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THEIR IN THEIR RATES SO THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT I THINK IT IS I WOULD CAUTION. AS I ALWAYS DO WITH CAL STUFF IT'S ALWAYS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED RATE THAN ANY OF US WANT IT TO BE -- YOU KNOW JC IS LEADING OUR WORK IN THIS AREA AND REALLY HAVING A TIME FRAME IN A TIME LINE. FOR THESE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE AN MEDI CAL -- AS SHE KNOWS AND EVERYONE WHO'S HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS AND OTHER PLACES NO YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT IT AS LIKE A FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR. FOR HER RISE IN IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO YOU KNOW TURN A BIG SHIP PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHEN I CALL THE TITANIC BECAUSE THERE AND LIKE WE'RE NOT THINKING. OF YOU KNOW IT JUST IT'S IN MY EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARSWE KNOW WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF POSITIVE CHANGE. BUT IT IT IS HARD AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE STRUGGLED TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS IS THE LACK OF STANDARDIZATION AND THE I'D SAY HI COMPLEXITY OF THE FUNDING SIDE THINGS OPERATE IN CERTAIN WAYS AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IF WE WERE. NAY IN A SORT OF HOW I FRAMED IT TO OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY IF WE WERE ALL DECIDING TO CREATE THE MEDICAL PROGRAM NEW TODAY. WE KNOW IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW IT LOOKS TODAY RIGHT I MEAN. NO ONE WOULD HAVE LIKE SAID THIS IS THE MOST RATIONAL WAY. TO STRUCTURE THE DELIVERY OF THIS CARE -- SO HOW SHOULD HOW WOULD WE WANT TO LOOK AND IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET THERE OR WHAT CHANGES WOULD WE HAVE TOMAKE TO GET THERE AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS BECAUSE I THINK THAT. FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF AGAIN WHAT'S CARVED INTO MANAGED CARE WHO'S OPERATING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS A CHALLENGE NOT JUST THE FEDERAL FUNDING PEACE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE STATE FUNDING AS YOU WELL KNOW FROM BEING YOU KNOW THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR WE HAVE A LOT OF NON STATE GENERAL FUND FUNDED PIECES OF OUR NON FEDERAL SHARE WHETHER IT'S YOU FROM OUR COUNTY. PARTNERS OR TAXIS ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ALL HAVE HAD COME WITH VERY SPECIFIC WAYS OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT. SO IT REALLY DOES TAKE A SORT OF ALL HOW IT HOW COULD THIS LOOK AND CAN WE GET THERE WITH WHAT WE HAVE SO. THAT REALLY IS OUR FOCUS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS TO REALLY TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE HAVING SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. CHANGE IN BOTH THE WAIT WHAT THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED AND HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM -- THAT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT DOES IT IS A LITTLE SCARY I THINK. YOU SEE GET SCARED OUR TEAM GET SCARED THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS ACTUALLY VERY CLOSE -- MA BUT I I THINK. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO EVEN BE ABLE TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION OF BETTER INTEGRATION FROM ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AND THAT FIRST STEP IS REALLY THAT SIMPLIFICATION AND STANDARDIZATION SO THAT'S SO THAT'S ONE PIECE AND THEN JUST IN TERMS OF THE ALIGNMENT WITH THE OTHER -- HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CERTAINLY YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS MAKE RATIONAL SENSE AND AGAIN I THINK FOR YOU AS A PROVIDER STRUGGLE TO RATE IF YOU'RE DIFFERENT RULES ARE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT ARE DIFFERENT QUALITY METRICS -- SO WE WANT WE WANT TO TRY TO HAVE A LIGHT MEANT THERE I THINK. THE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES AS AS CHRIS MENTIONED AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF BOTH THE UNIQUENESS OF MEDI CAL IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION WE SERVE SO OBVIOUSLY OUR POPULATION IS. FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT RATE THAN THE I WOULD SAY THE CALPERS POPULATION -- OTHERS I MEAN IT'S IT IS SICKER POOR POPULATION THAN THAN MOST WE ALSO HAVE THE MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS. THAT -- THAT DO COME WITH STRINGS AND THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOU. AREA AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WE ALWAYS. WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS PART OF THE ALIGNMENT CONVERSATION IS I THINK IT'S CHALLENGING FOR US AND WHEN IT'S PRESENTED AS MEDI-CAL SHOULD ALLY AND THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PRESENT IT BUT IS? HOW IT MEDI CAL SHOULD ALIGN WITH OTHERS INSTEAD OF HOW DO WE ALL A LINE TOGETHER? AND SEE NO NOT HAVING ONE PART OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM SORT OF SET HOW THINGS SHOULD LOOK AND THEN THE REST OF US FOLLOW -- PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS SUCH A LARGE PIECE WE CERTAINLY THINK IT WOULD BE. IMPORTANT TO HAVE US BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT SHOULD THINGS LOOK LIKE AND HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE THEM AND SO -- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WE DO WORK WITH ALL THE FOLKS THAT YOU HAD UP HERE WE HAVE CERTAINLY HAD CONVERSATIONS. AND WORKED WITH THEM ON IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES I THINK IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE -- THINGS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN THINGS WERE TRYING. TO SORT OF RESPONSE TO AND SO THEN WE END UP HAVING IN SOME CASES SOME DESPERATE THINGS AND FOR SOME REASON. FOR SOME BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE AND I AND FOR SOME BECAUSE WE THANKS VERY MUCH -- SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS ACTUALLY ABOUT DISSIPATION IN THE AND CALLING COSTED AUS WIE SNOW WAS ASKED BEFORE -- THERE'S AND I A CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT TWELVE YOU KNOW MEDI CAL IS THAT THIS IS A BIT DIFFERENT ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH AS YOU POINT OUT YES SICKER AND POOR YET WE SHOULD BE PAID MORE THAN XIN WE FOR THAT. I MEAN REALLY. IT'S A BEING THE LOWEST FARES ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST PAIR BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE SECOND FLOOR RIGHT SO WE DID TAKES MORE RESOURCES RIGHT. SIDES POINT THAT OUT. SO -- AND I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A DECISION BY THE WAY MADE COLLECTIVELY INCLUDING MYSELF ON THE LEGISLATURE. SO -- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A STEP FIGURE OUT YOU IT'S FOR ME IN MANY WAYS ONLY I HAD THE POWER TO DECIDE EVERYTHING. BUT HOWEVER I DO THINK IN TERMS OF AND AND AND SURE -- I MEAN THAT THAT -- PERHAPS THE ON THE AND SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT THAT SAME TIME -- HEAVY BE ABLE TO THEN DRAW COMPARISONS RIGHT -- TO CERTAIN DEGREE AND ALSO WAS A SAID DEBORAH CAL PATIENTS ARE STILL YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE IN HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT THEY HAVE SEEN SOMEONE ELSE SO THE STRUGGLE MORE WITH SOME OF THE WITH WITH HE INCOMES OF THE SO. DO YOU SEE -- ACTUALLY -- HOW WE CAN HAVE -- THE MEDIC OUR MEDICAL PLANS PARTICIPATE IN THE QUALITY INN COSTED OUT LIST SERVE THEIR THINGS WE CAN TRYTO DO. TO TO GET THAT INTO THEIR STORE AND I% I I THINK -- AS AS DR RIGHT WOULD MENTION AMY THINK THERE'S NOTHING THAT PROHIBITS OUR PLANS FROM PARTICIPATING I THINK THE CHALLENGE THEY'RE BEING THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT THE ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM -- AND SO THERE'S MISSING PIECES I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY THE CHALLENGE ALWAYS WITH US. PROVIDING DATA TO OTHER ENTITIES ONE IS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON USING IT TO DO OUR OWN MONITORING AND TRANSPARENCY AND ALL THE RESOURCES THAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE WE HOW WE LANDED WHERE WE DID WITH PROVIDING SUMMARY INFORMATION INSTEAD OF SORT OF ACTUAL PATIENT LEVEL DATA. IS JUST DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WAY THAT OUR STRUCTURE WORKS IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES IT'S NOT AS IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES WITH DATA THAT FROM A COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN RIGHT IT'S NOT. THE WAY THAT PAYMENTS ARE MADE-THE WAY THAT BENEFITS ARE CONSTRUCTED WHAT BENEFITS ARE COVERED. AND SO WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES OF SOME -- THAT YOU'RE WELL HERE HOWEVER WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THAT AND HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU COUNTER NOT COUNT THOSE THINGS IN CERTAIN MEASURES LIKE TOTAL COST OF CARE? BECOME SUPER COMPLEX AND SO I THINK WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE JUST HAVE DATA IN THERE WHEN IT'S NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON AND SO WE'VE TRIED TO SORT OF WORK AROUND. THIS WAY OF PROVIDING BUT MORE SUMMARY INFORMATION. AND ALSO SHARE OUT ALL THE ALL THE REPORTING AND DATA THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACE THAT PROVIDES REPORTING OF QUALITY IN CONTRACTOR BY MADE IT I THINK I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY TO LEAD. TO I REALIZE MAY NOT BE OBSOLETE APPLES APPLES BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS AND SO SOMETHING IS A MOBILE ASTERIX AND PLACES BUT I THINK THAT -- Và. WE HEARD A LOT IN THIS HEARING ABOUT NOW ONLY ALIGNMENT BUT IT NAY ON TERMS OF BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO CREATE -- BECAUSE IT IS A SITE YOU YOU WANT TO I MEAN THERE IS A CERTAIN DEGREE ONE CAN ARGUE THERE ARE SOME DEAL MEDI CAL PROVIDERS ONLY SEE MEDI CAL AND SO FORTH AND BUT I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT -- AND STARS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN OUR STATE ALSO AND AND AND AND SOME OF THE OTHER PLANS. YET BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMMON DATA. SOURCE OUT NOT EVERYTHING MAY BE EXACTLY THE SAME BUT I THINK FIRST OF ALL HELPS US BENCHMARK HOW WELL OUR MEDICARE PROGRAMS DOING HAVE THIS BENCHMARK OUR COMMERCIAL PLANS ARE DOING YOU KNOW AND THAT IT WAS A COMMERCIAL AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE. FINANCED PAID FOR HEALTH CARE RIGHT CALPERS COVERED CALIFORNIA IT'S ADDRESS SO -- SO I THINK TRYING TO WORK TOWARD BEING ABLE TO HAVE. THIS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL AS I JUST FOR CURIOSITY'S SAKE I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT VALUE BASED PURCHASING SO IF YOU'RE GOING OUT DOING VALUE BASED PURCHASING ONE IS YOU CAN LEVERAGE OFF AT OTHER MODELS ALSO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE YOU STAND. COMPARED TO WEAR AS A PURCHASER AS TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE STANDING OKAY WAIT A MINUTE OUTCOME I'M PAYING ABOUT MUCH MORE ARE OUT OF MY SYSTEMS WERE A YEAH THERE'S THAT WHILE WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN THEY ARE THAT SO I THINK THERE'S THAT THAT IT'S HELPFUL FOR EVERYONE. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE SHOULD HOPEFULLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE IN THAT DIRECTION IN MY MIND. AND IT BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS GOING TO BE -- YOU HAVE A PROVIDER LIKE MYSELF AND ALL HAVE FAILED WELL ACTUALLY LOT OF MEDICAID -- SOME COMMERCIAL AND OF AYE EVANS IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET YES EXACTLY THE SAME BUT ANY AND THAT WELL YOUR MEDICATION A DO DO THAT RIGHT AS SO. AND ACTUALLY MAY IT MAY WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING MEDI CAL -- ACTUALLY WE HAD A PRESENTATION ABOUT GMC IN SACRAMENTO AND THAT IS WITH INTERESTING THE ALWAYS IT EXCEPT FOR KAISER BECAUSE KAISER BASICALLY TREATS ALL THE PATIENTS THE SAME TO WRITE AND SELL. THEIR DELIVERY MODELS OF WHETHER YOU'RE MEDI CAL ARE YOU BUYING FIRST. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WANNA SEE ACROSS THE SYSTEM RIGHT SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH INSURANCE CARD YOU SHOW UP WITH. AND SO HOW CAN WE MOVE CLOSER IN THAT DIRECTION -- THAT -- AND AND AND AND AND TRY TO GET TO THAT DIRECTION SO I I CERTAINLY WOULD URGE AND HOPE THAT -- AND WITH AND NOW PLANNED ASK HOW WE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION -- IT THINK THE IN AND ALSO I THINK ESPECIALLY WE'RE DOING VALLEY'S IS PURCHASING THE PROPERTY SIX AT CETERA I THINK BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS LARGER DATA THING IS GOING TO HELP. DIED AT AT LEAST IN MY MIND -- DTS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT DOING VALUE BASED PURCHASING TYPE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESPECIALLY TO LEVERAGE OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S TO WRITE. IS NOT JUST LIKE ALL OF YOUR MEDICARE WILL DO THIS BUT LIKE MEDI CAL AND AND THIS ALSO INCOMING GALLOPING ALL SAID DO THIS I MEAN I THINK. EVEN THE GOVERNOR IS SAYING LIKE WE ALWAYS TO PULL ALL OF HER. YOU KNOW PHARMACY FIRSTLY WE WILL GET INTO ALL THAT BUT BUT YEAH THAT THE MAXIMALLY LEVERAGE EVEN EVEN FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE AS A PURCHASER IS A PAIR. ACROSS EVERYTHING INSTEAD OF HAVING EVERYTHING AND SILAS SO -- SO BIG WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE YOU KNOW -- CALIFORNIA'S GOV INITIATION MENTIONED DEL D. A LACK OF IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME AND I MEAN THERE'S PRESSURE SOME MEASURES WENT UP AND DOWN -- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE PEOPLE OUT BUT I MEAN THE RIGHT NOW IF WE HAD A SYSTEM WHERE HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT IMPROVING TRADE AND HAVE PAYMENT EVERY YEAR WE'RE NOT HITTING THAT SO. I I HOPE THAT -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT YOUR YOUR PLANS FOR THAT -- TOO AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU OFTEN SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE COVERING IT CENTER -- I AM INTERESTED IN KNOWING. THAT THE RESULTS -- SO I I HEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M STILL IN OFFICE IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE NINE YOUR TOGETHER YES WE'RE ALL BE HERE TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW AND AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE SCARY PART IS THOUGH IS AFTER I LEAVE OFFICE. I'LL BE SEEING MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. I EXPECT TO BE DIFFERENT. BETTER THAN IT WOULD AND IT'S TEN YES. OKAY AND THEN I THINK THE PREMIUM SLIDE AS WELL IN LIFE AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU WERE. AT EXIT RISING WHATEVER YOUR ROLE WAS WITH THIS WAR BUT WE WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND I'M WAITING KNOWLEDGE. YEAH HAVE A KNOWLEDGE THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT YES THERE'S A BIT OF A LAG BETWEEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT -- AND AND BUT THAT LAG ISN'T VERY LONG AND SO IT REALLY ISN'T A POSITIVE SENATE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU KNOW THEY HAD A BETTER RATE SO THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT MESSAGE SO. AND I REALIZE THERE'S A CMS COMPONENT BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE FIGURE THAT OUT AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE WE'LL. THAT MAYBE WILL BE LOOKING TO BE A DIFFERENT MINISTRATIONS ATTITUDE BY THE END. I JUST PUT IT THAT WAY -- SO -- SO I APPRECIATE THE THE WORK THE DO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT IT BOTH IN -- THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT ALSO IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL -- I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AFTER SOME RESOURCES WE MIGHT NEED TO PUT AND TO MOVE THINGS ALONG BUT IT'S AT THE A IT IS REALLY ABOUT. CULTURE CHANGE SYSTEM CHANGE AND THEN -- I MEAN IF IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT METRICS AS WELL SO THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY THING ALIGNMENT OF MODELS ALIGNMENT METRICS BECAUSE THAT WAY WE CAN COMPARE THINGS RIGHT -- SO I THINK THE I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I MEAN AGAIN I I THINK WERE VERY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE WITH SORT OF THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AGAIN I THINK THAT WE HEARD OUR PARTNERS TALK ABOUT THAT REALLY IS. WHERE WE WANT TO GO I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TIME FRAME -- AND IT'S NEVER GONNA BE AS FAST AS THE ALL WHAT. I I'VE BEEN LATELY POINT THIS OUT THOUGH I MEAN I THINK THAT -- AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MEDI CAL AND WITH THIS HEARING WAS ABOUT NEXT AMERICA ALONE. IS THE THERE'S A REASON HEALTH CARE WAS REALLY THE TOP OF THE AGENDA IN THIS LAST ELECTION AND WHEN -- AFTER EVEN AFTER GOVERNOR NEWSOME WAS ELECTED -- WHEN THE TV I SEE DID A POLL OF ALL THE PROMISES HE MADE? THE TOP ON THE PUBLIC SAID THEY WANT TO DEAL WITH HEALTHCARE RATE -- WE SEE YOU KNOW THAT WE WE SEE WORKERS WHOSE -- BASICALLY TAKE HOME PAY HAS REMAINED STAGNANT FOR VERY LONG TIME AND THERE COASTAL CONVERSATIONS GOT OUT BUT IT'S BIZARRE BY HEALTH CARE RIGHT. AND WE WE NEED -- TO SO WE REALIZE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE A BIG GIANT OCEAN LINER BUT WE GOT FOR YOUR HOW TURN THAT THING A BIT MORE QUICKLY. AND THERE ARE AND I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IS THERE ARE OP PROOF QUALITY AND AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE MONEY IS RIGHT PEOPLE THAT'S WHY THE FOCUSING ON PEOPLE TRYING TO GET ENOUGH SANDERS AND OTHER PLACES MIGHT BE CRYING BECAUSE HE THAT'S INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH TO PAY. FOR IT ABSOLUTELY AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT 7080% OF OUR HEALTHCARE SPENDING SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CRACK THAT NIGHT WE KNOW THERE'S DATA SHOWS US THAT WE DO WE GET THESE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS ETCETERA WE WILL. SPEND THAT CURVE SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE HOW WE CAN MOVE THEIR MORE QUICKLY AND ACTUALLY IT'S NOT JUST MEDI CAL ALONE AND I KNOW YOU CARE MORE ADDS THAT CAL -- IT'S NOT JUST THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IT'S NOT JUST COVER CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OF US DOING TOGETHER SO THAT EVERYONE WHO'S PART OF THIS KNOWS THAT THAT'S THE WAY THEY HAVE TO GO. AND CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE THAT TALK BRING IT TO SCALE BECAUSE IT'S GREAT WE HAVE THE PRIME AND SO FORTH I GOT IT AND THOSE ARE LOOKING THE WAY FOR WE'VE. IF WE HAVE LOTS OF PILOTS AND THE ONLY LOTS POUNDS SHOW GOOD RESULTS WE'VE GOT TO BRING THOSE TO SCALE UNDER PERCENT AGREE WITH YOU RIGHT YEAH SO IS THAT THE I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE NEXT AT THAT FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE THAT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO BRING THEM TO SCALE AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO TACK ON BRING THE SCALE RATE SO WE FEARED LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF STUFF. SO -- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND I I KNOW THAT YOU'RE MORE AT THE FRONT EDGE BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN BUT I MEAN I REALLY WANT A DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE SURE WITH THE POLICIES AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO IN THE FINANCING. AND TO BE SURE WE CAN GET THOSE IT'S TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS THEN YOURSELF. KNOW ALL RIGHT SO I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT I DO JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT I TECHNICALLY THIS IS TO BE IS. THAT THE ESTATE ALLOCATION BOARD MEETING RIGHT NOW WHICH I'M. THERE SO I'M GONNA ASK IF PEOPLE CAN KEEP THE REMARKS BRIEF AND ACTUALLY FEEL FREE TO SEND WRITTEN MARX'S FOLLOW UP AS WELL AS YOU IT TO ELABORATE ON THE POINTS YOU'VE MADE. HERE SO I DON'T WANT TO CUT ANYWAY I DON'T WANT TO LIKE CUT PEOPLE OFF BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU CAN KEEP IT UNDER A MINUTE OR LESS AND AND AND DO HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS AND AND AND AND AND THEN WE CAN -- FOLLOW UP ON THAT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AS THEIR CERTAINLY STEPS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRIES CHIN CAN DO. TO IMPROVE QUALITY FOR ITS MEDI CAL ENROLLEES SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND HOLDING MEDI CAL PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAID PLAN PERFORMANCE. AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE INNOVATIVE PRO MANAGED CARE PLANS HIGHLIGHTED -- BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THESE SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE ENROLLED IN IT ARE COUNTY THAT YOU RESIDE IN AND SO DO APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT REVISITING -- COUNT CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS AND SCALING UP BUT DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE QUALITY PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT IS DEVELOPED TO A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND THAT MAYBE BASED ON DATA THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I I HEAR SUGGESTION PERHAPS FOR A FOLLOW UP HEARING -- AN INTERIM WHICH I WILL CERTAINLY AM VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA. HI GOOD AFTERNOON M. JDS WOULD HELP ACCESS CALIFORNIA OUT WE APPRECIATE THIS HEARING AND ALSO THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RESURFACED AND WE HIGHLIGHTED ESPECIALLY AS WE THINK ABOUT. HOW WE ALIGN INCENTIVES ARE ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF COVERAGE WHETHER PRIVATE COMMERCIAL OR MEDI CAL -- PARTICULARLY WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION SERVED AND ALSO THE RICHNESS OF COVERAGE AVAILABLE BETWEEN YOU KNOW PURSE COVERAGE VERSUS A COVER CALIFORNIA COVERAGE. AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE MEASURES SHOULD BE -- KNOWING VERY WELL THAT THERE WILL BE DIFFERENCES IN JUST THE POPULATIONS SERVED AND LASTLY ON COVER CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AGGREGATED DATA. ON HOW QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS IN COVER CALIFORNIA ARE PERFORMING AND PROVIDING QUALITY CARE BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO WORK WITH COVER FRONT COVER CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD YOU AND UNDERSTANDING SPECIFICALLY BY PLAN IN TERMS OF WHICH PLAN ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THAT GOLD STAR AND WHICH ONES ARE FEELING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME. BLOW OF MARKETS CUSTER ON OF SLEEP IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE HEALTH NETWORK -- LIKE THINK THAT YOU'RE FOR HOLDING THIS -- INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- DEPEND AGREES WITH THE COMMITTEES -- BUT IS TO BE INNOVATIVE WITH HOW THE DELIVERS SERVICES TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT -- ANY INCENTIVE BASED MODEL IMPLEMENTED SHOULD BE ONE THAT PUSHES FOR HEALTH EQUITY BY TIME THOSE INCENTIVES TO REDUCTION AND DISPARITIES ACROSS -- THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND ENSURE CONSUMERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS EXPERIENCE -- BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES NOT ONLY OBSERVED IMPROVEMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE -- REDUCING EMISSIONS OF PATIENTS IN AND PROVING -- MENTAL HEALTH MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN -- WE BELIEVE A POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS UTILIZING AS YOU MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES -- SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND SUPPORT IN THE PAST AND INCENTIVIZE MEDI CAL PLANS AND PROVIDERS. TO DELIVER IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN AREAS SUCH AS CHRONIC -- AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- AS WE KNOW SUCH AS KIM IS A COLOR WHICH OF THE MEDICAL POPULATION IS MADE UP OF TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ON ALSO THE STATE SHOULD INVEST IN -- INSURING THAT PLANS AND PROVIDERS COLLECT MORE ROBUST DATA ON THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE -- AND THAT THAT'S IT THANK YOU YOU'RE [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY BEING FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE YOUR CHAIRS AND THE COMMITTEES DEDICATION AND ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS AND HEALTH CARE -- WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO IMPROVING QUALITY LOWERING COSTS PROMOTING BETTER HEALTH -- THROUGH IMPROVE CARE DELIVERY AND REDUCING HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES BROADLY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE ALSO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO BALANCE QUALITY GOALS WITH THE NEED TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON PROVIDERS. REDUCING ADMINISTRATIVE IN CAPITAL BURDENS ON PHYSICIANS WILL NO MATTER THE WAY THEY PRACTICE WILL OUT HIM TO FOCUS ON POPULATION HEALTH AND CARE FOR PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND CO MORBIDITIES. WE LOOK FOR TO THE COMMITTED CONTINUE DISCUSSION THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. WELCOME I A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR PAN -- SHOCK OF IT I WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND THE CERTAINLY IS A VERY -- ROBUST TOPIC -- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT ANY CONVERSATION ON CAL SHOULD BE CENTERED AROUND THE MEDI CAL POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES. AND I THINK HAVING A SORT OF A MORE STATEWIDE -- QUALITY PLAN AND FOCUS THAT LOOKS AT A COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR IS IT IS IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO MOVE DH CS AT MORE IN THAT DIRECTION -- BUT EVEN STILL IT'S BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS SICKER POORER AND BROWN -- SO EVEN STILL -- THERE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES AMONG REGIONS AND SO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC CERTAINLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OUR MEDICAID POPULATION THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE DEAL. BUT IN OTHER REGIONS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON ISSUES LIKE ASTHMA OR DIABETES OR HYPERTENSION AND SO JUST REALLY REFINING THE MEDIC HOW QUALITY STRATEGY TO BE ABOUT THE MEDI CAL POPULATIONS NEEDS. AND GETTING PROVIDERS TO THAT PLACE WOULD BE A GREAT STARTING POINT AND THEN YOU CAN EXPAND OUT FROM THERE THINK ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE THERE WAS SOME STUFF TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW VALUE OF INTEGRATED MODELS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND I WOULD JUST NOTE. THAT -- WORKING PEOPLE HAVE AND ALWAYS -- ACCRUED THE BENEFITS OF WHAT AS YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATED IN THE NUMBERS OR WHATEVER AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED EFFORTS THAT. ALSO PASS SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS AND SOME OF THAT VALUE ALONG TO THE WORKERS WERE PAYING FOR PREMIUMS AND CO PAYS AND DON'T SEEM TO ALWAYS BE GETTING -- THE BENEFITS THEY'RE SO LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE THE PUBLIC COMMENT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT PART OF THE REASON I'M INTERESTED TRAFIGURA HOW DO WE GET STATEWIDE DATA BECAUSE IT IS EQUITY RIGHT I MIGHT BE SURE THAT WE HAVE WE DO CHIEF EQUITIES I WE DON'T. SAY THAT WELL IT'S OKAY BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDI CAL YOUR THIS BUT IF YOU'RE IN THE REST OF THE SYSTEM YOU GET THAT. I APPRECIATE IS ALSO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- THE DIFFERENT REGIONS HAVE DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE NEEDS WERE PAID FOR A BIG STATE. AND I FULLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT PART OF THE REASON WE ALSO WANT TO TRY TO MOVE IT AND AND GET THIS DATA IT AND AS WELL AS THE METRICS IS THAT. WE DO WANT THE SAVINGS EVENTUALLY GET BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WORKERS WHO ARE PAYING THE PREMIUMS AND SO FORTH SO I MEAN WE AT THAT SOMETHING THAT -- BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S HARD TO TELL WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC COMMENT -- I WANNA THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS I THOUGHT WE HAD A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION I REALIZED AT THE TIME WAS VERY BRIEF AND WE ASK PEOPLE TO COVER. WHAT COULD BE COURSES IN AND A SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH OR PUBLIC POLICY AND AND AND BIKE THREE MINUTES SIR OUR ARE ARE FIVE MINUTES? SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE -- THE SPEAKERS UP TO SPEEDING AND AND AND REALLY SUMMARIZING THINGS AND I LOOK FOR TO TO ACTUALLY THIS I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS HEARING IS. NOT A LEADER NOT TENDED NOW EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GONNA TURN THE HEARING BUT THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. THE FARM HEALTHCARE SERVICES CALPERS -- COVERED CALIFORNIA OTHER GROUPS AS WELL TO BE SURE WE KEEP MOVING IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO AND AND AND MEDI CURVE SO WITH THAT -- THIS HEARING INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH IS NOW ADJOURNED THANKS RUMMAGE
