YOU KNOW WITH WHATEVER THEY

LEGISLATION. SINCE I STARTED.

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:06.517
AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:33:06.584 --> 00:33:09.354
UNTIL WE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.422

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:15.293
OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE AS WELL.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.294
THE FACT THAT. OUR MULTIPLE

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:17.995
POPULATION AND SENIORS HAVE TO

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:19.731
SPEND DOWN EVERY LITTLE BIT OF

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.232

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:22.200
THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:23.901
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ONCE

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.436
THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE IT'S

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:26.471
REALLY REPOSTEROUS AND THAT

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:27.739
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:29.273
PERPETUATING SYSTEMIC SYSTEM

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.576
OF. CONTINUAL POVERTY IS

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:32.410
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:33.478

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.079

THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST-

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.313

THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND A

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.590
LOT OF TIMES IT'S REALLY HARD

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.391
TO TELL WHO ACTUALLY OWES THE

ASSUMING THE HOSPITAL SHOULD

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.596
REDUCE THE DEBT. SO WHEN YOU

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.998
SELL THE DEBT. YOU REALLY

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.266
DISCONNECT THE HOSPITAL NOW

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.534
