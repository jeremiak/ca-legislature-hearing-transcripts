THE BUDGET PROPOSES TOLL FUNDING OF THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH IS MADE UP OF TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX. AND FIFTEEN POINT NINE BILLION IN OTHER FUNDS. THIS TOTAL REFLECTS BOTH DIRECT FUNDING AT THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS AND FUNDING FOR FINANCIAL AID. THAT STUDENTS MAY RECEIVE AT ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS.

FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ADULT EDUCATION AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES AND STUDENT FEES. THIS FUNDING SUPPORTS GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT AND NUMEROUS OTHER PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BILLS ON AND SUPPORTS INVESTMENTS MADE IN RECENT BUDGET AX. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT FUNDS AB NINETEEN WHICH ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. AND ALLOWED COLLEGES TO WAIVE TUITION FEES FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS IN THEIR FIRST ACADEMIC YEAR. THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISES A FRAMEWORK THAT -- PRIORITIZES AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS WHILE ALSO MAXIMIZING STUDENT SUCCESS AND THE NAVIGATION OF COLLEGE PATHWAYS.

BY EXTENDING THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISED TO FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS AND THEIR SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES FIVE MILLION ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND -- TO EXPAND OUT REACH AROUND THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. THE FORMULA ALLOCATES GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES BASED ON ADDITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENROLLED. AND SPECIFIED STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS SUCH AS THE COMPLETION OF A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING SOME REVISIONS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ADDRESS -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NON LEASE IN THE DATA BEING REPORTED. SPECIFICALLY MAINTAINING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RATES INTO. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND CAPPING YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION AT 10%. THESE REVISIONS ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE LONG TERM FISCAL STABILITY OF THE FORMULA AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME TO ENSURE. THE ACCURACY OF DATA.

FOR STATE OPERATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A ONE TIME NON PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. FOR STAFFING CONTRACT FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION THE BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING NON PROP NINETY GENERAL FUND.

FINALLY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITIES PROJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING. FOR TWENTY SEVEN NEW AND CONTINUING PROJECTS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JACK'S WALLED. AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MICHELLE JOCKS WORLD -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'LL BEGIN WITH UNIVERSITIES -- THE GOVERNOR'S DOLLARS ON DURING GENERAL FUND. US FOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THIS INVESTMENT WILL ENSURE THAT BOTH UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET IMMEDIATE OPERATIONAL NEEDS. INCREASE EFFORTS TO RAISE GRADUATION RATES IN OVERALL STUDENT SUCCESS. MNC INFORMATION PROGRAMS THAT US SUPPORT ACCESS TO THESE INSTITUTIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN BOTH THE CSU AND THE UC. THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TUITION REMAIN FLAT IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CONVEYED THAT THE FUNDING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS CONTINGENT ON TUITION AND FEES REMAINING FLAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BEGIN AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH EACH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. ON HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE ON SHORT AND LONG TERM INITIATIVES TO PROVIDE FISCAL CERTAINLY FOR STUDENTS IN THE FAMILIES. INCREASED ACCESS IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND PROVE THE LINK BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE SKILLS NEEDED FOR THE ECONOMY NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS ISSUE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS YEAR'S YOU CURRENTLY SERVES ABOUT FOR UNDER TEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ADDS TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. THE BUDGET PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THREE HUNDRED AND THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH IS ONGOING. THE POLLS CAN BE BROKEN UP INTO FOUR PARTS. THE FIRST COMPONENT SEEKS TO ADDRESS ONGOING. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE COST OF INCREASED COMPENSATION FOR CSU EMPLOYEES. AND A SUPPORT HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF OUR PROPOSAL RELATES TO ACCESS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES SIXTY TWO MILLION FOR A ROMAN GROWTH EXPANDING TO SEE ISSUES CAPACITY BY 2% OR ROUGHLY SEVEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO COMBAT STUDENT HUNGER HOMELESSNESS TWO BILLION ONE TIME JOURNAL FUNTRIVIA POTENTIAL CSU CAMPUS. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND FUND TO HELP FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS ACCESS THE CSU. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF RCC PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON STUDENT SUCCESS. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET CALLED ON THIS ISSUE TO INCREASE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES AND SHEER TRANSFER GRADUATION RATES WITH SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND STUDENTS ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS. THIS IS THE GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. COMMITS THE UNIVERSITY TO AMBITIOUS GRADUATION GOALS INCREASING THE FOR YOUR FRESHMAN GRADUATION RATES ARE AT LEAST TRANSFER GRADUATION RAPE TO AT LEAST 45%. INCLUDING GAPS NOW COMES BETWEEN THE START AND STERN GROUPS OF THEIR PEERS. TODAY THE UNIVERSE THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND I'M GOING TO THE TO THE GRADUATION IS ALSO A TOTALLY TOTAL GREAT GENERAL FUND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE INCLUDING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE BUDGET PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE WORK. THE FOURTH AND FINAL PIECE OF A PROPOSAL ADDRESSES CRITICAL FACILITIES THE TO THE CSU. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALLOCATES TWO AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU TO HELP ADDRESS IT'S DEFERRED BACK MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. AND EXPENSE ON CAMPUS CHILD CARE CENTRES. MOVING ON TO THE UC. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE TEN UC CAMPUSES ENROLL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. WITH ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED INTO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS CONNECTED TO ITS EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THE BUDGET PROPOSES INCREASE OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE UNIVERSITY. OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION IS ON GOING. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO SUPPORT FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS THAT USE EXTENSION CENTERS. THIS INVESTMENT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN LAST YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED COMPENSATION NON SALARY PRICE INCREASES. AND SIMILAR COSTS. FORTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION FOR DEGREE CHAMBER AND STERN SERVICES PROGRAMS FIFTEEN MILLION TO ADDRESS STUDENT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS. TEN MILLION TO SUPPORT. ENROLLMENT BACK CURRENTLY PAY FOR WITH ONE TIME FUNDS AND FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO ENDS THE PRACTICE OF SHIFTING GENERAL FUND OUT OF UC'S BASE BUDGET AND BATTLING WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX MONTHS TO SUPPORT GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THIS CHANGE PROVIDES EASY WITH FORTY MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES UNDER THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS UC'S ESTIMATED FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE UC. TO EXPAND AND PILOT DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS AND EXPAND A CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AT ITS EXTENSION CENTERS. ALTHOUGH THE ALL THESE OUT YOUR COMMITMENTS DO NOT APPEAR IN THE BUDGET BILL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED ONE POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ENSURE THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS HAVE ONGOING SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AID PROPOSALS THAT WILL HELP STUDENTS PARENTS AND NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTS THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVE NEARLY TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN AID AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THE STATE'S LARGEST YOU FINANCIALLY PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO SERVE. FORMER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND PROVIDE MORE IS MADE. TYPICALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND. TO INCREASE OUR PROVIDE ACCESS AWARD THING TO INCREASE WILL PROVIDE ACCESS WORDS TO STUDENT PARENTS. STUDENTS ATTENDING THE UC SYSTEM COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND RECEIVE A CAL GRANT A OR B. AWARD WE'LL GET AN ANNUAL ACCESS WORK OF UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. CAL GRANT SEES STUDENTS WILL SEE THEIR BOOK AND SUPPLIES GRANT INCREASE FROM ONE THOUSAND NINETY FOUR DOLLARS TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS BY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FROM 250-007-52330. THOUSAND COMPETITIVE CALENDARS RECIPIENTS ARE OFTEN NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WERE OLDER FROM LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FACE SERIOUS BARRIERS TO COMPLETION. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS WILL IMPROVE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT AWARD. WITH THAT -- WILL CLOSE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND JENNIFER CAN FOR CELLO FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THINK THE SERGEANTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED A HAND OUT ENTITLED OVERVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS GREAT -- PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT JUST SUMMARIZES ALL THE PROPOSALS YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT SO THE GOVERNOR HAS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN NEW HIRE AND SPENDING. ABOUT 30% OF IT IS ONE TIME ABOUT A BILLION OF IT IS ONGOING -- AS YOU PLANTS OVER THE LIST YOU CAN SEE THAT AMONGST THE ONE TIME SPENDING IN THE BOOK OF IT JUST FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ON ON GOING COMMITMENTS THE LARGEST COMPONENTS ARE FOR COMPENSATION AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INCREASES AS YOU GLANCED DOWN THE LIST YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS TREATING THE SEGMENT SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY IN SOME KEY AREAS AND ROAMING GROWTH. HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEALING WITH STUDENT HEALTH ISSUES JUST FOR EXAMPLE? SO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM YOUR BUDGET OVERVIEW HEARING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AN ON GOING SPENDING IN TOTAL SO YOU CAN SEE HERE OF THE ONE BILLION IN NEW ON GOING SPENDING. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION AS PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION AS NON PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IN ONGOING SPENDING. ABOUT A QUARTER OF IT IS BEING SPENT ON THE UNIVERSITY SOME FINANCIAL AID YOUR FIRST ORDER DECISIONS ARE TO SEE IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LEVEL OF ONGOING SPENDING AND WITH ABOUT A FOURTH OF IT. GOING FOR THESE PURPOSES. THE SECOND PAGE JUST SUMMARIZES ALL OF THE CAP OUTLAY HIGHER AT PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THERE'S THIRTY PROJECTS NEW PROJECTS TOTALING ONE POINT TWO BILLION AND BUDGET YOUR STATE COSTS. YOU CAN ALSO SEE DIFFERENCES HERE SO IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES FUNDING PULMONARY PLANS AND WORKING DRAWINGS FOR TWELVE NEW PROJECTS TOTALING EIGHTEEN MILLION. IN PROP -- ONE IN PROP FIFTY ONE BOND RELATED COSTS. FOR CSU HE'S PROPOSING FUNDING ALL OF THE PHASES OF THE PROJECTS IN ONE YEAR USING UNIVERSITY BOND FUNDING FOR THAT. FOR THE UC PROJECTS IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF MOST OF THESE PROJECTS ALSO USING UNIVERSITY BOND FUNDS. SO THE REST OF THE HAND OUT AS OUR ASSESSMENT AT A HIGH LEVEL OF THESE PROPOSALS. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION SO THIS ADMINISTRATION AS CONNECTING AUGMENTATIONS TO SPECIFIC BUDGET PRIORITIES. WHEN WE TURN TO LOOKING OUT SPECIFIC BUDGET PROPOSALS THERE ARE SOME THAT WE THINK ARE REAL WELL CRAFTED THERE'S DATA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE TO DEMONSTRATE THERE'S A PROBLEM OR AN OPPORTUNITY THERE IS A CLEAR POLICY OBJECTIVE? IS CONNECTED WITH A POLICY SOLUTION THAT'S TIGHTLY ALIGNED THERE'S AN ACCURATE COST US TO MEN THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR MAKING SURE THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT HOW THE MONEY IS BEING USED. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS WERE ONE OR MORE OF SO THAT'S WHAT THE REST OF THIS HANDOUT IS ABOUT. SO COMPENSATION IS ONE AREA WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS DESIGNATING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE SAYS HERE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATEMENT SO DEPENDING ON THE STATEMENT THE SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE GROUPS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS FUNDING SUFFICIENT COVER BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF AND THREE AND A HALF PERCENT SALARY INCREASES. THE ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION IS FOR YOU SEE NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR CORE FUNDED STAFF THE BUDGET DOESN'T INCLUDE AN INCREASE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. YOU SEE HAS REQUESTED 3% THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT MAYBE YOU SEE CAN YOU HAVE ALTERNATE A FUND SOURCES TO COVER THAT COST BUT IT'S NOT IN THE EXPLICIT BUDGET BEFORE YOU. FOUR IN A ROW FOR A MOMENT GROWTH YOU'VE ALSO ALREADY HEARD ABOUT DIFFERENCES THE ADMINISTRATION IS FINDING ABOUT HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT GROWTH AT THE COLLEGE'S 2% GROWTH THAT CSU AND NOTHING FOR YOU SEE IT AND NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S NO CLEAR GUIDING RATIONALE FOR WHY THE ADMINISTRATION IS TREATING. THE SEGMENTS DIFFERENTLY IN THIS REGARD. THE ADMINISTRATION IS FUNDING STUDENT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES OUT ALL THREE SEGMENTS ALSO YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS TAP ON OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CAPTAIN THAT AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO IMPROVE. ALSO AT THIS POINT IN TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW YOU SEE WOULD USE ITS IMPROVEMENT FUNDING WHETHER IT WOULD JUST BE FOR UNDERGRADUATES AND IT WOULD GO FOR IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES AND NARROWING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. OR WHETHER IT ALSO MIGHT GO TO GRADUATE STUDENTS FACULTY RESEARCH OTHER IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO TAKING NOTABLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES -- TOWARD DEALING WITH STUDENTS LIVING COSTS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO AS CSU HE'S FUNDING THESE INITIATIVES ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THE JUST THERE IS THAT CSU WOULD WORK WITH DS ASKED TO TRY TO HAVE BETTER COORDINATION AS WELL AS LOCAL AGENCIES WORKING WITH CAMPUSES TO HAVE BETTER COORDINATION. HE FUNDS THESE EFFORTS ON ONGOING BASIS AT UC AND IT'S NOT CLEAR YET WHETHER THAT FUNDING WOULD GO INTO THEIR REGULAR FINANCIALLY PROGRAM OR WHETHER IT WOULD GO FOR TARGETED FOOD AND HOUSING INITIATIVES. HE PROVIDES AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES THAT YOU SEE BUT NO AUGMENTATION OF THE OTHER TWO SEGMENTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HE HAS NO SPECIFIC FOOD AND HOUSING RELATED PROPOSAL BUT HE IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE CAL GRANT JUST FOR STUDENT PARENTS TO HELP WITH FOOD LIVING AND OTHER. FOOD HOUSING AND OTHER LIVING COSTS. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENT PARENTS DO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS SO LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE GOVERNOR LACKS THE VISION FOR HOW HE WANTS THE STATE TO ADDRESS STUDENTS LIVING COSTS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. REGARDING TOP OUTLAY THE GOVERNOR IS BEING SELECTIVE HE'S GOING THROUGH PROJECT BY PROJECT AND FIGURING OUT WHETHER THERE IS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT YOU CAN SEE THE ADMINISTRATION IS ONLY APPROVING TWELVE OF THE THIRTY NINE PROJECTS THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SUBMITTED TO IT. ELEVEN OF EIGHTEEN PROJECTS THAT. ALL OF THE UC PROJECTS -- ARE BEING APPROVED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS POINT THERE'S ALSO SOME EXPLICIT CRITERIA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS USING THAT WE ALSO THINK IT'S A POSITIVE STARTING POINT. ALTHOUGH WE THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR MORE CONSISTENCY -- UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU ON WHAT CRITERIA ARE BEING USED TO EVALUATE THOSE PROPOSALS. AND YOU FOR THAT THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO RAISE TUITION AND ALSO WANTS TO ENGAGE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO PROMOTE TUITION PREDICTABILITY -- BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A EXPLICIT PLAN FOR HOW TO DO THAT MOVING FORWARD. SO THE LAST TWO PAGES OF MY HAND OUT FOCUS ON SOME AREAS WHERE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER BUILDING UPON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IMPROVING THEM REPLACING THEM WITH YOUR OWN PRIORITIES. MAYBE STEPPING BACK TAKING TIME TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION BEFORE YOU PROCEED FORWARD. WE THINK AGAIN THAT HAS BASIC APPROACH IS PROMISING THAT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND ENGAGE WITH HIM NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL A LINE THEY ARE WITH YOUR OWN. WHEN IT COMES TO COMPENSATION YOU COULD ENCOURAGE THE SEGMENTS TO DO AS STAFFING ANALYSIS THAT WOULD LOOK AT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION DATA AND THEN YOU COULD USE THE RESULTS AT LEAST NEXT YEAR TO INFORM THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE? MOST OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY CONTRACTS OF BARGAINING UNIT CONTRACTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY ENROLLMENT TARGETS WE WOULD SUGGEST AT A MINIMUM YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES SO DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE ALIGNMENT OF THE EXISTING ENROLLMENT LEVELS WITH THE MASTER PLAN ELIGIBILITY PULLS THE NUMBER OF DENIED ALL DOUBLE STUDENTS THE NUMBER OF RE DIRECTED STUDENTS. THE FIRST TWO OF THESE FACTORS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE ISN'T A NEED FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH ON THE LATTER TWO FACTORS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME. MERIT TO HAVE IN A ROMAN GROWTH. IF YOU DO DECIDE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR STUDENT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LINK THE FUNDING WITH PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS SO YOU WOULD BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU WANT WITH CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT. IN GRADUATION RATES NARROWING ACHIEVING GAPS REDUCTION AND ACCESS UNITS. TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE THEN THE STATE DOES HAVE A LONG STANDING TRADITION OF COVERING TUITION FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AND COVERING BOOKS AND SUPPLIES FOR A SUBSET OF THE NEEDIEST FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. BUT IT DOES NOT TO DATE HAVE A LARGE SCALE PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH LIVING COSTS. I'M SO BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROGRAM ESPECIALLY BEFORE CREATING A PROGRAM THAT MIGHT JUST OPERATE OUT ONE SEGMENT AS OPPOSED TO ALL OF THEM. WE THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT THE STATE COULD LEARN. SO THE STATE COULD GATHER MORE AND INCIDENTS AN UNDERLYING CAUSES OF FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY ACROSS ALL OF THE SEGMENTS. GET MORE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON COST OF ATTENDANCE ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENT PARENTS. UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION OF STUDENT FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS WITH PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS INVOLVED IN PROVIDING MORE LIVING SUPPORT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS VERSUS OTHER LOW INCOME FAMILIES. MEASURE UNMET NEED AND DECIDE HOW TO PRIORITIZE AVAILABLE FUNDS SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE UNPACKED WE THINK IN THIS AREA IT'S SIMILAR WITH MENTAL HEALTH. THE STATE COULD LEARN QUITE A BIT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ACROSS ALL OF THE SECTORS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE FOR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THAT MIX WHAT ARE THE EXISTING RESOURCES INCLUDING STUDENT FAMILY HEALTH PLANS TO COVER ASSOCIATED COSTS -- AND WHAT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. AGAIN WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S CUP OUTLAY STRATEGY IS GENERALLY PROMISE SCENE -- BUT THERE STILL ARE A FEW PROPOSALS PROJECTS THAT WE THINK ARE JUSTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE AS THE ISSUE THERE IS STILL A PROJECT THAT WOULD FIND NOT ONLY A RENOVATION OF THE THEATER BUT A SIDE BY SIDE THEATER. THIS JUST RAISE A CERTAIN ISSUES ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES WHETHER YOU WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A SECOND THEATER ON A CAMPUS OR USE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR OTHER CAPITAL OUTLAY OR OTHER OPERATIONAL PURPOSES. AND I'M TUITION PREDICTABILITY WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THIS THIS WAS SERVICE AND SO WE WOULD CONTINUE AS WE SAID EARLIER HEARINGS TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUILD UP YOUR RESERVES THE EVEN HIGHER LEVELS THAN PROPOSED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ONE WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO SHARE SOME OF THE COSTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THESE COST INCREASES YOU'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT WITH NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS SO. FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WILL NOT PAY THE COST INCREASES REGARDLESS. THE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW IS YES YOU ARE PAYING ABOUT 23% OF THEIR COSTS THEIR EDUCATION COSTS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT GOES DOWN 221%. AT UC SINCE OUR PAINT NON NEEDY FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS ARE PAYING 13% AND THAT WILL GO DOWN THEY HAVE FAR GREATER RESOURCES FROM NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY CROSS SUBSIDIZING RESIDENT STUDENTS. BUT ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAN GETTING RESERVE TO THE STUDENTS DIRECT MORE INTO YOUR RESERVES YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A SHARE OF COSTS POLICY MOVING FORWARD. WHEREAS RESERVES ARE THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE TUITION PREDICTABILITY HUMMING A SURE OF COST IS THE BEST WAY TO SEND SIGNALS TO NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR EXPECTATIONS. SO WHETHER THESE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES THEY ENTER COLLEGE DURING A RECESSION OR RECOVERY THEY WOULD KNOW YOUR EXPECTATION AS TO WHAT SHARE OF THE EDUCATION COSTS THEY SHOULD COVER IS IT A QUARTER. IS IT HALF WHATEVER YOU MIGHT CHOOSE IT TO BE. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ALL OF A FEW BUTTONS FIRST OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO YOU MENTIONED -- THE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE. ONE BEING ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND SO ONE OF THAT THE NUANCES OF THIS BUDGET AS I SAID THE OPENING. THE GOVERNOR HAS AT THE MAZING BUDGET HE SPENT FIFTEEN MINUTES TALKING ABOUT USUALLY WE'RE HERE FOR LIKE NINETY SECONDS TALKING ABOUT GOVERNOR BROWN'S JANUARY BUDGET. SO WE HAD FOUR MONTHS TO FOCUS ON OUR PRIORITIES. AND SO GET OUT PARK OUT FOR A SECOND THEN THE FACT THAT THE REVENUES COMING IN RIGHT NOW. MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THAT MAY REVISED WE'VE HAD THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE HAD. OPPORTUNITY IN MAY TO DO SIGNIFICANT GOVERNOR INITIATIVES IN LET'S SAY MISTER DEEDS ON THESE POLICY AREAS SO. IF IF THERE WAS A DESIRE FOR EXAMPLE TO PUSH FORWARD ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR YOU SEE CSU. AND THERE'S NOT ADDITIONAL REVENUES ARE ARE THERE. ARE THERE -- PROGRAMS ARE ARE -- PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET WHICH YOU THINK. DON'T -- IT HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP -- AND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER BUT THAT'S LOOKING AT THOSE IF WE WANT TO FOCUS ON OTHER PRIORITIES. LIKE ENROLLMENT GROWTH YES THERE -- THEY'RE TOUGH DECISIONS AND OUT FOR YOU TO MAKE SO WE HAVE FOUND SOME PROPOSALS THAT WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT. BUT THEY'RE GONNA SOUND LIKE VERY DIFFICULT TRADE OFFS FOR YOU -- SO FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING A NEW CAL GRANT JUST FOR STUDENT PARENTS. WE THINK IS ADDING EVEN MORE COMPLEX STEM NOW WE HAVE AGAIN SPECIAL CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARDS JUST FOR THIS ONE SUBGROUP THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- THERE YOU SEE MENTAL HEALTH ONGOING RESOURCES -- YOU MIGHT ALSO JUST STOP NOT NECESSARILY NOT DO SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE BUT FIGURE SOME THINGS OUT BEFORE YOU WOULD SPEND THAT MONEY THIS YEAR -- I THINK ALL TOTAL ACROSS OUR NON NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION BUDGET SO EVEN INCLUDING SOME THINGS WE SAY ON THE EARLY ADD SIDE WE DO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SOME MILLION DOLLARS YOU COULD CONSIDER REPURPOSE SCENE FOR ONGOING SPENDING. THERE'S ALSO SOME THINGS ON THE ONE TIME AFFRONT TO WHERE WE THINK YOU MIGHT CONSIDER REPURPOSE IN THOSE -- BUT YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY LIKE THIS KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANT'S INTEREST AND STILL DOING SOMETHING BUT IT IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU COULD USE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. TO BUILD YOUR BUDGET PACKAGE. SO. ONE ISSUE THAT WAS SOMEONE REYES AND BELIEVE BY YOU IS IN THE UC ALLOCATION FOR THE TWO FORTY THERE IS THE FIFTY MILLION. FOR GRADUATION [inaudible] INITIATIVE AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT GRAD INITIATIVES BUT IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN UC. IT'S BEEN THE CSU CONVERSATION. SO IS THAT. YEAH I'M SORRY THAT THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT POINT THAT WE GO OVER IN MORE DETAIL IN OUR REPORT YEAH OUT OF LEAD THE KEY ISSUES WITH YOU SEE HAVE TENDED TO BE COST RELATED -- AS OPPOSED TO LIKE SAME KINDS OF ISSUES WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU TRYING TO IMPROVE DEGREE COMPLETION YOU SEE ON A LONG STANDING BASIS HAS HAD THE HIGHEST GRADUATIONRATES AMONG THE STATE MONTHS. THEIR SIX YEAR RATE ISN'T LIKE THE HIGH EIGHTIES SO MOST STUDENTS WHO GO TO UC COMPLETE -- SO IF YOU WANTED TO AGAIN YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY HAVING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THAT IS ONGOING MONEY IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER LARGER ONGOING COOL CORD OUT YOU SEE OR ANY OTHER HIGHER ADD OR NON NINETY EIGHT BUDGET PRIORITY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY I THINK AND THEN LASTLY YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TUITION POLICY. I KNOW IN YEARS PAST THERE'S BEEN IN. CONTACT WHAT HAVE YOU BETWEEN. GOVERNOR'S AND THAT YOU SEE IN CSU SEGMENTS AND THAT A PIECE OF THAT IS A TUITION POLICY AND WHEN YOU'RE PROPOSALS HERE IS IS LOOKING AT THEM. THE NON NEEDY STUDENTS AND THEIR I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS THAT THE YOU WOULD HAVE IT. FOR PEOPLE AT THE EXTREME AS FAR AS INCOME AND THEY HAVE. IT WILL BE AT THE AT KIND OF A NO I'M SORRY I MIGHT HAVE JUST GONE TOO QUICKLY BECAUSE THE CAL GRANT COVERS THE TUITION LEVEL WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU SEE ARE CSU AND THE BOND DOES THE SAME AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO WHATEVER THE TUITION LEVEL IS THE STATE CALIFORNIA COVERS AT FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS IN EASTERN FILLS UP A FAST AND HAS. A MINIMUM LEVEL OF NEED THE STATE COVERS ARE TUITION COSTS SO THE ONLY STUDENTS EFFECTIVELY PAYING THE TUITION CHARGE AT THE SEGMENTS ARE NON NEEDY STUDENTS AND WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE LIKE. TWO THIRDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE UNITS ARE WAIVED SO THERE'S A CHUNK OF STUDENTS STILL BUT A RELATIVELY SMALL STUDENT SHARE STUDENTS ARE PAYING THE FEE. AND THOSE WHO ARE ARE YOUR ARM. MORE MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS AND SO I I APPRECIATE IT IS A COST ON THESE MIDDLE INCOME AND UPPER INCOME FAMILIES BUT IF YOU GET TO HAVE A LARGER RESERVE OR MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THESE ARE KEY TRADE OFFS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER -- THE CULTURE OF COSTS THAT NON NEEDY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW THOSE WHO ARE PAYING THE CHARGE THE SHARE OF THEIR EDUCATION COST IS IS STILL HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED STRIKE POLICY CALIFORNIA IS PAYING. A 77% OF THE COST OF EDUCATION FOR THESE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AT CSU ALMOST 90% AT UC -- COMBINED WITH ACTUALLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NON RESIDENTS FOR YOU SEE SO WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. IT WOULD IT BE SUCH A TO AT THE SHARE THEIR PAIN TODAY AT 23% OF THOUGHTS TO SHARE YOU THINK AS REASONABLE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING FEES FLAK FOR SEVEN EIGHT NINE YEARS AND HAVING THEIR SHARE JUST IMPLICITLY GO DOWN. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I BUT I GUESS I'M I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S LACKING IS WE DON'T HAVE. RESOURCES FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND I KNOW THAT THE YOU SEE -- AND SEE THIS YEAR AND TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. SO THE CURRENT TUITION FOR EXAMPLE FOR UC'S ROUGHLY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IF YOUR HEY UPPER INCOME YOU SEE FAMILY AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE PROBABLY SAY HEY WE PAY A LOT IN OUR TAXES AND SO FORTH THAT'S THAT'S OUR SHARE BUT PARKING THAT FOR A SECOND. WOULD YOU HAVE IN THAT IT AT TUITION BASED UPON. AN INCOME. SO IF YOU MAKE FAMILY OVER TO ONE FIFTY GRAND YOU PAY X. TUITION AND THEN. RATCHET DOWN OR UP HOW LOGISTICALLY WOULD YOU DO THAT I'M SORRY WE IMAGINED IT WOULD BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD SO IF YOU DECIDED TO APPROVE CERTAIN THINGS AND UC'S BUDGET SAY YOU DECIDED TO INCREASE AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 3% INCREASE TO THEIR CORE BUDGET YOU WOULD JUST SHARE IT BETWEEN THE STATE AND NON NEEDY STUDENTS SO EVERYBODY SHARE WOULD GO AT YEAH BUT BUT HOW WILL THAT MANIFEST TO THAT FAMILY PAYING THEIR TUITION BILL. IT WOULD GO UP 3%. FOR ALL STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY PAY THE FEE THEY WOULD PAY 3% MORE NEXT YEAR NOT BASED UPON WHERE YOU'RE AT IN THE INCOME SKIN NOW WE WEREN'T IMAGINING ANYTHING THAT COMPLEX. THIS IS A CLEAR FILE IS BUT THAT WOULD MEAN A TUITION INCREASE RIGHT EXACTLY YES BAXTER KEY FACTOR THAT YOUR KEY TRADE OFF. WHETHER YOU WANT TO ASSESS NON NEEDY FINANCIALLY STE NEEDY STUDENTS A TUITION INCREASE SOMEWHERE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF INFLATION OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU DECIDE -- AND AGAIN IT TO DO THAT EFFECTIVELY MEANS JUST WHATEVER NON NEEDY FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WERE PAIN AS A SHARE OF COSTS IS JUST REMAINING STUDY OVER TIME ON ON YOU ARE TREATING THEM SIMILARLY IT TO LAST YEAR IT'S JUST COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND SO EVERYBODY'S PAYING A LITTLE. BIT MORE TO COVER THOSE COSTS. OKAY YET I THINK YOU SAID THE KEY WORD IT'S A TRADE OFF YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE THESE NON TUITION POLICIES BUT THE SAME TIME WE CAN ADOPT BUDGETS. LIKE WILL HAPPEN HERE IN JANUARY. WHICH DOESN'T HAVE -- ANY MONEY FOR ENROLLING NEW UC STUDENTS. AND YOU KNOW MINIMAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH STILL TURNING AWAY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ELIGIBLE SI IS USED TO THAT SO THAT'S JUST THE CHOICE WE NEED TO MAKE OKAY. MISTER MARTZ. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IDEA -- APOLOGIZE FOR A COMING IN LATE AYE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TRUSTED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR. BUT A QUESTION FOR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- A WIDE WIDE THE YOU KNOW THE THIS IS MY FIRST A NON AND BROWN ADMINISTRATION -- JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL AND AND I'M I'M I'M USED TO SEEING A A BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH A VERY LITTLE DIRECTION ON HOW TO SPEND NEW FUNDS -- WERE AS IN IN THIS BUDGET IS SEEMS TO BE PRETTY PURSE. FOR PRESCRIPTIVE -- I WANTED TO ASK WHY THE GOVERNOR IS NOT PROPOSING SPECIFIC NEW FUNDING -- FOR NEW CALIFORNIAN ROMAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WELL. THE SEGMENT SUBMITTED THEIR OWN BUDGET PLANS A REQUEST TO THE ADMINISTRATION THE ADMINISTRATION REVIEW THOSE. REQUESTS AND ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- THE MINISTRATION MADE CERTAIN CHOICES AND DECISIONS ON WHAT WAS THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECT OF THAT REQUEST. COR OPERATIONAL COSTS MAKING SURE THAT THE QUALITY THAT THAT EDUCATION AND DEGREES YOU KNOW THAT THE PIECE IS COMPLETE. MAKING SURE THE STUDENTS ARE FED AND HOUSED -- THERE'S ALSO THE THE MATTER THAT THE USE COMPARED TO THE THIS IS TO THERE'S A MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS OF THAT THE YOU SEE THAT. THE ISSUES YOU JUST DOESN'T HAVE SO WHILE THERE. WELL IT WASN'T PROPOSED IT WAS DUE -- TO A FOCUS ON THE MOST CRITICAL CONCERNS HOWEVER AS YOU FOR THE PROCESS WERE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT. ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITHIN THE ARGUS DEBT ARCHITECTURE OF THIS YOU SEE PACKAGE. SO DID THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA REQUESTS -- ADDITIONAL ON A FUNDING. FOR NEW CALIFORNIA ROME THEY DID. OKAY [inaudible] AND SO. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- ASSESSMENT OF THE MOST CRITICAL NEED SPREAD. TO IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUESTED -- I I I I BELIEVE THIS -- A COMMITTEE HAS. CONSISTENTLY MADE TO ACCESS TO ALL OF THE SEGMENTS IS BUT INCLUDING THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA'S BEING A TOP. MISTER CHAIRMAN I LOOK FOR TO HAVE IN THAT CONVERSATION -- THANK YOU YEAH NO I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT ON AND THAT'S ONE GLARING WEAKNESS AND YOU'RE SAYING THE UC. YOUR FIRST STATEMENT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T THEY MAY THE PROPOSAL AND THAT WASN'T IN THE PROPOSAL BUT WHAT DID WAS. YOU JUST CHOSE NOT TO FUNDED. FINANCE CORRECT NO MISTER MCCARTY AT NO POINT DID I SAY THAT THE UC HAD REQUESTED YOU AND ROMAN FUNDING WE REVIEW THE PROPOSAL IN SELECTED THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF THAT REQUEST FOR YOU YOU RANK THEM AND YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THEM WRITE THEM HE WENT. DOWN ONE THREE SEVEN TWO YES IS THIS NINE THIS IS THE RESULT OF OUR REVIEW. THAT'S YES [inaudible] OKAY. MR O'DONNELL. YEAH I I'VE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS GOING TO BE AN INCREASE FOR OR FOR UNDERGRAD ENROLLMENT AND I I GOT A MAGIC IF WE'RE GONNA HEAR THAT IT'S GOING TO COME FROM. THE PRESIDENT HERE A FEW MINUTES AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT. MONEY FOR AND MAYBE WERE AHEAD OURSELVES. I DON'T KNOW BUT THE UC SITUATION IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET SITUATION WAS JUST COMPLICATED SO. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS TO FIND SOME OF THE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ENROLLMENT GROWTH I DON'T KNOW? YES EMILY EXACTLY I GUESS THIS ADMIN CLARIFY THAT IS THAT YOU SEE WHEN WE DO THEIR ENROLLMENT. BECAUSE HOW THEIR APPLICATIONS COMMAND IT'S HARD TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY AFTER DOT THE BUDGET THE IF YOU DO. BUDGET YEAR. PLUS ONE SO WE'RE FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE DEAL FROM LAST YEAR MAYBE MAYBE I CAN SALAS WATER WE I ALL OF BRING THAT QUESTION OF WHEN THE PRESIDENT COMES OF MAKES HER PRESENTATION. BECAUSE MAYBE SHE WILL MAKE THAT ASK I DON'T KNOW MY UNDERSTAND IS THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. FOR MORE MOMENT AND WE'LL GET THAT CLARIFIED BUT THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO COVER A THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM LAST YEAR'S INCREASE WHICH I THINK WAS A A ONE TIME EXPENDITURES BEES PROPOSING I ASSUME THE BUILDING INTO THE BUDGET. TEN MILLION DOLLARS IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY OKAY JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE WITH REGARD -- TO FIRST OVER TALK ABOUT A TUITION INCREASE -- THAT'S CAN BE A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION THAT CONCERNS ME GREATLY -- AGAIN ANYTHING THAT WOULD BIFURCATED TO WOULD BE VERY CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I'M HEARING FROM A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. THAT ARE FEELING PRESSURE AS WELL AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF PUSH BACK ON A TUITION INCREASE YOUR FOR THEM. AND AT SOME POINT THIS COM THIS THIS THIS COMMITTEE WELL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND ABOUT HOW THAT FUNCTIONS. BECAUSE I KNOW THE AVERAGES ON THAT BUT I ALSO ON ON THE NEED SEE THE MODE AND HOW MUCH EACH STUDENT IS GETTING. UNDER THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AGAIN I DON'T WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW MY QUESTION THOUGH IS FOR THE THERE'S EVER TO MONEY -- FOR YEAH I THINK YOU'RE SEEKING TO UNDER FIFTY TWO AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING INCREASED. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS TIMELY COMPLETION OF A DEGREE IN INCREASED AGREES. OF STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS -- THIS IS YOU SEE IT'S OUR OB ISN'T THE AVERAGE -- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY IF TOM HAD THE AVERAGE TIME IT TAKES A UC STUDENT. IS FOUR POINT TWO YEARS TO GRADUATE. DOES ANYBODY KNOW. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT BUT IS IT IT MAY BE FOUND THAT SEE ISSUE WITH A SIX POINT TWO WOULD. YOU SEE WAS SICK. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS OUT THERE ARE LOOKING EACH OTHER BUT ANYWAYS -- I'LL BE THE EXPERT ALSO IT'S FOUR POINT. TWO OKAY BUT EITHER WAY -- I JUST SO I WONDER WHY THEY WOULD NEED THAT MONEY GIVEN THAT THAT'S A PRETTY IF IF IN FACT THAT NUMBER THAT I'VE SPEWED OUT. AND DIDN'T MAKE UP I BELIEVE -- IS TRUE I WOULD JUST WONDER WHY THEY WOULD NEED THAT MUCH THANK YOU SEE WILL COVER THIS AND MUCH MORE IN DEPTH BUT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENCES IN GRADUATION RATES ACROSS CAMPUSES AND ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS SO IF THEY WERE TO USE IT ON UNDERGRADUATES THE KEY ISSUE BEFORE YOU. AS IN THE WHOLE SCHEME OF YOUR BUDGET HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENCES FORCES OTHER ENROLLMENT GROWTH OR ANY OTHER PRIORITIES YOU MIGHT HEALTH. CARE AND I WAS LOOK FOR SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENCES SO THEY CAN BE MORE CONSPICUOUS WITH THAT BACK YOU MISTER YEAH AND I THINK YOU RAISE A GREAT POINT MR O'DONNELL IS THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO REALLY. EXPAND ENROLLMENT. AND BIRD DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN A TUITION WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM. OTHER PROGRAMS THE STATE BUDGET. THIS IS SO MAKES SENSE TO HELP STUDENTS AT UC ALREADY GRADUATE AVERAGING FOUR POINT THREE YEARS. THE COULD USE SOME OF THAT TO EXPAND A ROMAN GROWTH AND THEN TAKE A LOOK AT A MORE NUANCED A GREAT POINT BUT JUST ONE COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK OUR MISSION SHOULDN'T BE. JUST TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT. MISSION SHOULD BE TO SERVE THE STUDENTS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED. BEFORE WE EXPAND IN ROME. OKAY SO WITH THAT LET'S BRING UP OUR OF MISTER GALLAGHER. SO ONE I I DO SHARE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IS THE REGARDING THE TUITION INCREASE -- BUT ALSO WITH THE FIFTEEN MILLION -- FOR IN THE GRADUATION RATES YOU KNOW I I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT LIKE WILL. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT MONEY AND WHAT YOUR PLAN WHAT'S YOUR PLAN WITH THAT MONEY IN AT LEAST FROM THE YOU SEE THAT'S ONE THING I'LL BE LOOKING TO HEAR? FROM AND REALLY WHEN WE'RE SEEN. SOME I THINK SOME GOOD PERFORMER WITH THE MONEY THEIR USE IN. TO YOUR BETTER GRADUATION RATES -- AND YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE YOU SEE IN. WE ALSO AND ON THE ENROLLMENT FRONT WE STILL DON'T KNOW. AS FAR AS I KNOW WHAT THEIR CAPACITY IS BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION AS A MAN CHAIR BUT THIS AS FAR AS I KNOW -- BUT ONE THING I WANTED TO KEY IN ON FROM THE LA -- IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH ISSUE IS TO ACTUALLY LOOK TO NEXT YEAR AND SET A CAP ON ON THAT FUNDING. RATHER THAN PAYING AT THE NEXT YEAR LET'S LOOK INTO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND SAY HEY HERE'S YOUR NUMBER. AND YOU'VE GOT TO STAY WITHIN THAT NUMBER. RIGHT I MEAN AND AND TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE. A POTENTIAL WAY TO REALLY STAY ON TRACK AND STAY ON TRACK FINANCIALLY -- FUNDING WISE RATHER THAN TO SIT WITH THEM TO JUST KIND OF GOING TO THE NEXT YEAR BLINDLY AND THEN JUST. AS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GUESTS DO NOW. PAY WHATEVER IT WAS -- YOU KNOW TO ME CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION AS AS MAY BE SOMETHING WE COULD DO. SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE HAS STARTED DOING SO IT AS IF I RECALL THE EXACT YEARS CORRECTLY WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOR YOU SEE THEY DID SET A BUDGET YOU'RE PLUS ONE ENROLLMENT TARGET. SO YOU SEE AS OF RIGHT NOW HAS MADE A LOT OF VIRTUALLY MOST OF ITS DECISIONS FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR. SO SOME OF WHAT YOU DO RIGHT NOW FOR YOU SEE WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR SO WHAT THE STATE HAD STARTED DOING WAS TO SAY WELL NOW WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM A TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR NOVEMBER A LOT OF OFFERS YOU CAN INFLUENCE WHAT THEY DO THEY CAN KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPECTATION AS WE STILL ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE THAT A PRACTICE FOR UC AS SEEMS TO BE A WAY FOR YOU TO BE MUCH MORE INFLUENTIAL. IN WHAT YOU WANT THEIR ENROLLMENT LEVELS TO BE. ON THE STATE HAS HAD SORT OF MIXED SUCCESS DOING IT WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE ISSUE AS A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGE AT SPRING IN ROME AT LEVELS SUCH THAT CITING AN OUT YOUR TARGET DOESN'T SEEM QUITE AS ESSENTIAL FOR THEM -- BUT IT IS AN OLD IT IS A WAY TO GIVE BOTH YOU AND TO THE SEGMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE PREDICTABILITY ON YOUR EXPECTATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER IT'S IT'S FIFTY MILLION NOT ONE FIVE BY THE WAY YEAH BUT THAT'S EVEN MORE REASON TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT [inaudible] THIRTEEN WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. QUICK QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MY APOLOGIES FOR IF YOU WERE TO COVER THIS -- WITH THE ALLOCATIONS BOTH FOR UC AND CSU REGARDING. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I I SEE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LISTED OUT A SPECIFIC LIST OF CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT THAT WERE IN AND NOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS THERE ALSO A COMPANY LIST FOR YOU SEEN CSU HI WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A FULL LIST OF THE PROPOSED PROJECTS ARE PROJECTS THAT THE UC AND CSU WE USE THESE FUNDS. FOR HOWEVER BOTH SEGMENTS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IDENTIFIED BACKLOG FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. ARE YOU GOING TO PUT A LIST TOGETHER. I WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU SEE AS THE FOR THIS PROCESS GOES WERE TO TO SORT OF LOOK THE WITH WHICH PROJECT WILL BE FINE WITH THE SCHOLARS AND MAYBE WE COULD ALL. DO THAT TOGETHER [inaudible] CERTAINLY. YEAH AND AS YOU'VE PROBABLY KNOWN FROM OUR EARLIER WORK BUT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE SEGMENTS BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THEIR PROPOSED PROJECTS THAT FINANCE BE REQUIRED A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO TELL YOU WHETHER THOSE PROJECTS WERE ACTUALLY UNDERTAKEN. FOR THEM BOTH TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCING THE BACKLOG AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG AND THEN IDEALLY THEY EVEN HAVE A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THEIR OUR BACKLOG ON A LONG TERM BASIS. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH LA -- LAST YEAR AT THE MAY REVISION AND COULD MONEY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I THINK THAT WAS ON IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT HAPPENED AT SUCH A LATE -- LATE TIME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY BREAK OUT THE SPECIFIC ITEMS. I DON'T THINK FROM -- ONGOING BUDGETARY PRACTICE IT'S A VERY RESPONSIBLE PRACTICE SO -- I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW WHERE WHEN POWER SPENT FOR IT FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT WOULD BE -- MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE TO ACTUALLY BREAK OUT THE EXPENSES -- AT THIS POINT WE'VE BEEN TRYING. TO GET -- SORT OF MORE INFORMATION IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO SIFT THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE RECEIVED. SO IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- BEFORE WE COULD REALLY APPROVE ANY APPROPRIATIONS THE COULD BE DIFFICULT WITHOUT OUT THE LIST OF CAMPUSES AND PROJECTS. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S A BRING UP OUR NEXT [inaudible] I'LL. PERSPECTIVES FROM OUR THREE SEGMENTS THE BILL START WITH PRESIDENT APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES CHANCES WHITE IN OAKLEY. TO DISCUSS HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IN THE BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I NOTED THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR THE PRIOR PANEL AND I'LL BE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THOSE DURING THE Q. AND A PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM THIS THIS EVENING -- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WAS TRULY APPRECIATIVE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S BUDGET INTRODUCTION IT IS A SOLID DOWN PAYMENT. TOWARD HELPING OUR STUDENTS ACHIEVE. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM OF THE IDEA THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE A BETTER LIFE. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY START OUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR COLLEAGUES. OF FOR THE STATE FUNDING -- THE UC HAS RECEIVED IN RECENT YEARS -- THESE FUNDS HAVE SUPPORTED KEY PRIORITIES THAT THE UNIVERSITY AND STATE LEADERS SHARE. EDUCATING MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS EKANAYAKE TING GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH TO ADDRESS A SOCIETY'S CHALLENGES AND A FUEL THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY -- THE SET THIS EVENING I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS JUST A FEW OF CRITICAL AREAS RELATED TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FIRST SOME GOOD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. I WILL NOT REQUESTED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS INCREASED TUITION FOR IN STATE STUDENTS. FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR THIS WILL MARK THE SEVENTH TIME IN EIGHT YEARS THAT WE HAVE NOT INCREASED IN STATE TUITION. AT THE UC. OF A BOARD OF REGENTS CHAIR GEORGE KEEPER IT INDICATED IN JANUARY THAT HE DID NOT FAVOR TUITION INCREASE. AND HOLDING TUITION FLAT REFLECTS OUR MUTUAL GOALS AND INTENT. HOWEVER. THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE NEWS TO BE HOLDING TUITION FLAT. MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS LESS INSTITUTIONAL AID TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR POOREST STUDENTS FOR THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. CURRENTLY WE TAKE ONE THIRD OF OUR TUITION REVENUE AND RETURN IT TO AID TO OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS -- THEY CAN USE THAT FOR HOUSING AND FOR FOOD. AND IF WE HOLD TUITION FLAT THAT AMOUNT DOES NOT GROW. WE'LL ALSO WORKED AGGRESSIVELY TO CONTAIN COSTS WITHOUT IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION ALL WHILE IN ROLLING MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAN EVER BEFORE -- BUT DOING SO AS CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR CAMPUSES. UP AND WHILE I'M DELIGHTED TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY BECAUSE HOLDING IN STATE TUITION FLAT IS A GOAL WE ALSO OUGHT TO ATTAIN. AS LEGISLATORS YOU SURELY RECOGNIZE THAT MANDATORY COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. STATE FUNDING WHILE SUBSTANTIAL HAS NOT BEEN COMMENSURATE. WITH COVERING THE INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS WITH THE INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT WE HAVE AND KURT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE HOLDING TUITION FLAT FOR THIS MANY YEARS HAS NOT COME WITHOUT CHALLENGES. AND REQUIRED A LOT OF WORK ON THE PART OF OUR CAMPUSES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE YOU SEE HAS INCREASED BY ONLY TWO POINT 5%. COMPARED TO AN 18% INCREASE IN THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES AS MEASURED BY THE CALIFORNIA CPI. WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED IN THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THE QUALITY OF THE UC EDUCATION FOR WHICH WE ARE JUSTLY KNOWN. THIS MEANS THAT WE EITHER HAVE -- HAVE MODERATE PREDICTABLE STABLE TUITION INCREASES. OR A COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF ONGOING STATE FUNDING ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST FINANCIAL AID. IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT YOU SEE AND ITS CHANCELLORS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE BOARD OF REGENTS. ARE DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR VISION FOR THE UC OF THE FUTURE. INFORMED BY THE STATE'S NEEDS AND STRATEGIES FOR REALIZING THAT VISION. THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS PLAN IS TO STRENGTHEN UC'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND PIVOT FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUDGETING AND PLANNING PROCESS. TO AN OUTCOME ORIENTED APPROACH THAT AIMS TO ACHIEVE BOLD ASPIRATIONAL GOALS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. OUR MULTI YEAR FRAMEWORK CONTAINS GOALS SUCH AS AWARDING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE DEGREES. BY TWENTY THIRTY IN ADDITION TO THE MILLION DEGREES ALREADY PLAN. REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES A STUDENT TO GRADUATE. AND ASSIST STUDENTS WHO LEFT YOU SEE BEFORE GRADUATING IN COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE. AND GROWING A DIVERSE FACULTY SHOW THAT WE ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE POPULATION WE SERVE. AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT RELATION. WE'VE BEGUN TO SHARE OUR MULTI YEAR PLAN WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION FACULTY AND STUDENTS. AND WE WILL BE EAGER TO RECEIVE YOUR FEEDBACK. WE BELIEVE OUR VISION WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO DO ITS PART. IN MAKING THE CALIFORNIA DURING THE UC DREAM A REALITY FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS PLAN REQUIRES YOUR PARTNERSHIP. IT'S DEPENDENT ON A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE TO ENSURE THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN ACCESS AFFORDABILITY. AND IMPORTANTLY QUALITY. I'D LIKE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTRODUCTION. WHICH PROVIDED YOU SEE WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION IN NEW ONGOING FUNDING. AN INCREASE FROM PAST BUDGET INTRODUCTIONS WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS AND WE REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THESE FUNDS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE UNIVERSITY IS ADDED MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. GREATLY EXCEEDING OUR INITIAL TARGET OF TEN THOUSAND NEW IN STATE STUDENTS BY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THROUGH THIS ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AND FIRST CHEN STUDENTS. BUT AS YOU KNOW UC STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR AND OUR CAMPUSES NEED ONGOING FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THE NEXT CLASS OF STUDENTS THAT REPLACE THEM. THROUGHOUT THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. TO SUPPORT THIS INCREASED ENROLLMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS WE ARE REQUESTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IS CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IN LAST YEAR'S STATE BUDGET THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. REFLECTING THE SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN AN EFFORT SPEARHEADED BY HIGHER EDUCATION CHAIR MEDINA. APPROVED ONGOING PERMANENT FUNDS. THESE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED INSTEAD OF A TUITION INCREASE AND TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WITH ALREADY AND ROLLED. THIS ALLOWED US NOT TO INCREASE TUITION LAST YEAR. BUT ALTERNATELY THE FINAL BUDGET BILL PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY WITH NINETY FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME MONIES. THAT ONE TIME MONEY WILL GO AWAY IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTRODUCTION DID NOT INCLUDE FUNDS TO REPLACE THIS AMOUNT. SO PUT SIMPLY ABOUT HALF OF OUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION REQUEST IS THAT THIS FUNDING BE PROVIDED AS PERMANENT FUNDS. JUST AS TUITION WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE. DOING SO IS ESSENTIAL TO SUSTAINING UC'S INVESTMENTS IN INSTRUCTORS TEACHING ASSISTANTS AND CAMPUS BASED PROGRAMS. WITHOUT THESE FUNDS OUR STUDENTS SIMPLY MAY NOT GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED. THE OTHER HALF OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION. WOULD. GO TO SUPPORTING A LARGE -- LARGE PART OF THE ADDITIONAL -- HAPPENED A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION WOULD SUPPORT. AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADS AND ONE THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS -- ALLOWING US TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE FACULTY AND STAFF REQUIRED. TO SUPPORT PREVIOUS ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AS WELL AS SOME MODEST CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. NO I'M NOT HERE JUST TO ASK FOR MORE MONEY I'D LIKE TO SHARE OUR PROGRESS ON COST CONTAINMENT AS WELL. WE HAVE REDUCE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. OUR NEW PROCUREMENT PROCESS IS SAVING THE UNIVERSITY WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. YOU SEE HAS EXTENDED THIS PROGRAM TO SEE ISSUE A COLLABORATION. KNOWN AS CAL USE SOURCE. OUR SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM CALLED FEAR IT LOOKS SAVES US ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION A YEAR. WE ENDED FINANCIAL AID TO NON RESIDENT STUDENTS IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LEADING THE FORTY TWO MILLION AN ANNUAL SO LAMENTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS WHICH HAVE YIELDED A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN SAVINGS. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS AND CREATE EFFICIENCIES WHILE MAINTAINING ACCESSIBILITY AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY. SO IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE YEARS. TO COME AND TO THE STUDENTS THAT WE ALL -- ARE PLEASE TO EDUCATE AND PREPARE PREPARING NEXT GENERATION THANK YOU MISS THANK YOU CANCER RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND TO THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY -- GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S FIRST BUDGET PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A BOLD AND HISTORIC COMMITMENT -- IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT INDICATES IS RECOGNITION OF OUR CAREFUL STEWARDSHIP OF STATE FUNDS. AND OF THE SUCCESSES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE WITH PREVIOUS STATE SUPPORT IN TERMS OF ACCESS IN TERMS OF QUALITY. AND IN TERMS OF DEGREE COMPLETION. BUT MORE THAN INVESTMENT HIS PROPOSED BUDGET REFLECTS A SHARED VISION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND ITS CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING CALIFORNIA REALIZE ITS BRIGHTEST FUTURE. IT IS A VISION THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE. I THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS. TODAY I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE CAL STATE VISION IS BEING REALIZED AND EXCITING AND QUITE FRANKLY HISTORIC WAYS. WELL THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF EXAMPLES I COULD HIGHLIGHT TO ILLUSTRATE OUR PROGRESS. UNIVERSITIES GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO I'VE PROVIDES PERHAPS THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE. WE LAUNCH THIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS REALLY QUITE AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. WHILE ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS AMONG OUR STUDENTS FOR PARTICULARLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO ARE CAL GRANT. OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE INVESTMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MORE COURSE SECTIONS A HUNDRED ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND ABOUT. NINETY THOUSAND RENDON SEATS IN OUR CLASSROOMS. AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION YOU PROVIDED TO US IN THE CURRENT. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND YEAR WELL OUR CAMPUSES TO CONTINUE THESE TRENDS. THANKS TO THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OF ART THESE FUNDS IN AN UNWAVERING RELENTLESS FOCUS ON THIS INITIATIVE -- PAY SOME KEY CHANGES IN POLICY -- EDUCATIONAL POLICY ARE AMBITIOUS GOALS ARE PROVING TO BE ATTAINABLE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE GRADUATED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY AND SYSTEM WHY GRADUATION RATES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS. WITH YOU CALCULATE THEM AT THE FOUR YEAR THE SIX YEAR TO YEAR TRANSFER FOR YOUR TRANSFER EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THE FOR YOUR GREAT -- FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENT INCREASED BY SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS. ARE TO YOUR GRADUATION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUMPED BY 7% AND I THANK YOU HE LAURIE YOU IN YOUR FACULTY. OF FOR SENDING A SUCH WELL PREPARED STUDENTS. THE NUMBER OF BACHELOR'S STUDENTS AWARD IN TWO HISTORICAL HIGH OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THAT'S AN INCREASE OF SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES OVER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED DEGREES MORE THAN IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN LEGALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT. RIVETING BROUGH BEGINNING TO SEE SUCCESS IN CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP BETWEEN OUR STUDENTS TO COME FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME. THAT WOULD DROP THAT EQUITY GAP BY -- AS FULL TWO FULL PERCENTAGE POINT WHICH IS REALLY A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND SO OFTEN THE STUDENTS OF THE STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE'VE DONE THAT DECREASE IN THE EQUITY GAP AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE IN ROLLING MORE. LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT ARE PARA RECIPIENTS AND MORE STUDENTS COMING FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND FIRST GENERATION. THIS IS INDEED RESTORED PROGRESS AND MOTHERS WORK TO DO THERE ALWAYS WILL BE WE'RE PROUD OF THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR PRODUCT ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON THAT ELEMENT OF OUR STUDENT BODY. MORE THAN PROGRESS HOWEVER THIS IS MOMENTUM MOMENTUM MADE POSSIBLE BY THE SKILLED FACULTY IN. AND STAFF THAT WE ARE A PLUS TO HAVE THE CSU AND OUR CAMPUS LEADERS WHO ARE LEADING THE CAMPUS FOCUSED EFFORTS. TO SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS ACHIEVEMENT AND COMPLETION OF DEGREE. IT REALLY REPRESENTS A DIVIDEND FOR YOUR INVESTMENT THE STATE INVESTMENT IN A CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IN IN A GRADUATION INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW THIS MOMENTUM TO BUILD. THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN RECURRING FUNDING HE PROPOSAL ENABLE US. TO PROVIDE FAIR COMPENSATION TO THE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND FACULTY AND STAFF WHO WORK SO DILIGENTLY TO HELP OUR STUDENTS ACHIEVE THEIR ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL GOALS. HE'LL HELP US EXPAND ACCESS TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IT WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN THE PROVEN RESEARCH SUPPORTED STRATEGIES FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SUCCESS AND COMPLETION THAT UNDER PAN OR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IN A TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR A CAPITAL NEEDS WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR CAMPUSES CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CLASSROOMS LABORATORIES CLINIC STUDIOS IN THE LIST GOES ON BUT WE CAN. AND WE MUST DO MORE. YOU'RE ONLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC IT'S A DIVERSE GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUNG CALIFORNIANS. SATISFY THE CALIPHATE UNIVERSITIES ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPEN THE DOORS -- TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR SIXTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND WE'RE THIS BUDGET TO INCLUDE THE INVESTMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR GRAD INITIATIVE WHICH IS WHAT WE REQUESTED. WE ARE CONFIDENT WE COULD CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY REMAINS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ALL QUALIFIED CALIFORNIANS. THE OPPORTUNITY IS MADE POSSIBLE BY HER HIGHER EDUCATION. THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT COME WITH A DEGREE FROM THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. AND ON A MASSIVE SCALE WE PREPARE PEOPLE TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND FUTURE PROSPERITY LET ALONE SOCIAL ABILITY FOR THEIR CELLS OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THE SCOPE OF OUR MISSION REQUIRES A ROBUST FINANCIAL COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSAL PRESENT REPRESENTS JUST SUCH A COMMITMENTAND WE FULLY SUPPORT HIS BUDGET RECOMMENDATION. WE ALSO STAND READY IN THIS IS IMPORTANT WE STAND READY AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CHOOSE TO FULLY FUND OUR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IN OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE BUDGET REQUESTS. LET'S NOT LOSE TRACK. THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY A MANY GUYS THINK GROUPS INCLUDING A PP I SEE HER LOOKING AT THAT DEGREE DEFICIT THAT THE DROUGHT OF DEGREES BACCALAUREATE DEGREES. IN CALIFORNIA OF ONE MILLION. AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF THAT AMOUNT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL BOTTLER EIGHT DEGREES. THIS REQUIRES RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE IF WE DON'T INVEST NOW IN A STRONG ECONOMY WE WILL NOT ANSWER THIS CLARION CALL. TO THE DETRIMENT OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE DETRIMENT OF CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU CARE MCCARTY THANK YOU [inaudible] TRANSPORTES. GOOD AFTERNOON A THANK YOU FOR HAVING US -- THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE AT THE TABLE AND THANK THEM PUBLICLY FIRST OF ALL THANK -- CHANCER WHITE FOR THE GREAT WORK TO SEE IS DOING SEE A FUTURE WITH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND THANK A PRESENT A POLITICIAN A FOR A COMMITMENT TO TRANSFER. PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ASSOCIATES. TO I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF LEADING. ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST TREASURES CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND I'M GLAD TO BE BACK HERE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. IT'S BEEN. A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS SINCE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMMITTED TO OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS. GUIDED BY THAT VISION WE CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. AND DRIVE INNOVATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION WITH THE RELENTLESS FOCUS. ON ENSURING THE STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. ACHIEVE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. WE'RE COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING OUR NORTH STAR OF CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND WE'RE CHARGING FORWARD. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE ARE FOCUSED ON RESTRUCTURING OR COLLEGES. SO THAT THEY WILL BE MORE STUDENT READY. AND WE SHINE A CLEAR SPOTLIGHT. ON THE ISSUES OF EQUITY ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN A KEY AN IMPORTANT PARTNER. AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU PROVIDED CRITICAL FUNDING. FOR THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK. OUR COLLEGES R. CREATING CLEAR PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT. AND FURTHERING THEIR EDUCATION. THEY'RE HELPING EVERY STUDENT CHOOSE AND ENTER THEIR PATHWAY AND THEN STAY ON PATH -- AND WE'RE MONITORING THEIR PROGRESS IN THOSE OUTCOMES YOU ALSO -- SUPPORTED LANDMARK A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION AB SEVEN OH FIVE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WHEN? WHICH INSURES THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT PLACED INTO REMEDIAL COURSES THAT MAY DETER THEM FROM EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS UNLESS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS. THAT THEY ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES. THE SAME YEAR. WORKING TOGETHER WE CREATED THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROBLEMS. THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. THE COMPONENTS OF THAT PROGRAM RESONATE DEEPLY -- WITH ME AND WITH MY EXPERIENCES IN LONG BEACH IS I'M SURE. MEMBER O'DONNELL CAN ATTEST -- THROUGH THE LONG BEACH COLLEGE PROMISE SCHOOL LEADERS. WORKING WITH COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FACULTY AND STAFF. PROMOTE A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE. IN CLEAR PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS TO FOLLOW. AS THEY MOVE FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO THE OTHER. THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE NOW MAXIMIZES ACCESS TO EXISTING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS ENCOURAGES COLLEGES. TO ENGAGE IN EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUCCESS STRATEGIES. IT AUTHORIZES FUNDING TO BE USED TO SUPPORT ONE YEAR OF FREE TUITION. FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OR FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY INCLUDED FOR THAT PURPOSE. THAT AT THE ALREADY TO WAIVE FEES IS LINKED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFYING THAT COLLEGES MUST DO THE FOLLOWING. THEY MUST EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THEY SHOULD USE MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR ASSESSMENT EMPLACEMENT CONSISTENT WITH ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVEN OH FIVE YOU MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK THAT YOU HELP INVEST IN. THEY MUST ENSURE THE STUDENTS COMPLETE THE FEDERAL OR STATE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. I ALSO KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THE CHANGES WE MADE LAST YEAR WERE. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE. THOSE CHANGES WILL REINFORCE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE GOALS. AND CREATE IMPORTANT NEW OPPORTUNITIES. FOR WORKERS FOR WORKING ADULTS MANY OF WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY GREAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SEIU IN OTHERS. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HELP THEM RESPOND TO THE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. RECENTLY NAMED HEATHER HYLES TO BE THE COLLEGE'S FIRST CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. HEATHER IS AN INNOVATOR. SHE IS AN EDUCATIONAL LEADER AND A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR WITH A DEEP COMMITMENT TO EQUITY IN EDUCATION ANY CREATING. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDER REPRESENTED IN UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. IF YOU HAVEN'T MET HER ALREADY. WE WILL SOON ARRANGE FOR YOU TO MEET HER. AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL SEE THE SAME QUALITIES THAT I'M CONFIDENT WILL MAKE HER AN EFFECTIVE LEADER. FOR CALIFORNIA'S NEWEST COLLEGE. I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE THE GOVERNOR KNEW SOME PLACES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS REFLECTED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A BUDGET. THAT BUILDS ON YOUR PRIORITIES OF REFORM AND SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. BECAUSE OF BILLS ON A FRAMEWORK CREATED UNDER AB. NINETEEN I WON AGAIN THANK CHAIRMAN CARTY FOR YOUR EFFORTS AROUND AB. TWO MY STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. TO MAKE SURE THE BILL ACCOMPLISHES OUR SHARED GOALS. BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE FRAMEWORK ENACTED IN AB NINETEEN MUST REMAIN IN PLACE. IF THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO HELP US ACHIEVE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. THAT PROPOSAL IS PROP A IS PART OF A BROADER THEME IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ADDRESSING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN GAIN SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS THAT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. LET ME UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF THAT WORK. TO ACHIEVE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE REFORMS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MUST BE COMPLIMENTED. WITH CHANGES TO THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES THE TRUE COST OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EXPANDS CAL GRANT THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WHO RELY ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE MOST. WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT FOR THE NEW CAL GRANT FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND FOR THE NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY'S LEADERSHIP. IN EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID. I COMMIT TO WORK WITH YOU TO PUSH THE NEEDED REFORMS FORWARD THIS YEAR. AS YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SPONSORING SENATE BILL TWO NINETY ONE AUTHORED BY SENATOR LEYVA. I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR CO AUTHORING THE BILL. AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF MEMBER MEDINA AS WELL. THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS SUPPORTERS REFLECT A BROAD COALITION. INCLUDING OUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF WHO WORK WITH THEM EVERY DAY. TO ADDRESS OUR MOST BASIC NEEDS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH -- THAT THE PRINCIPAL ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNDER GIRD THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE BECAUSE STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE. THEIR TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADES. A STUDENT'S FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES BUT ALSO CRITICAL ISSUES LIKE HOUSING. FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLIES A STUDENT. SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL GOALS THAT IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STUDENT SIX TO COMPLETE A DEGREE. A CERTIFICATE OR SHORT TERM CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR PARTICULARLY THOSE. WORKERS WHO MAY BE DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVELIHOOD. I WON AGAIN RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO CHANCE OR WHITE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE ONE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE STATE SO GREAT OUR OUTCOMES ARE INTERCONNECTED AND WE MUST FOCUS ON STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ATTEND TODAY. NOT MOVING FORWARD. I COMMIT TO WORKING TIRELESSLY TO COMBAT THE ASSUMPTIONS OFTEN. MADE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR VALUE. FROM TIME TO TIME I HEAR SOME. IN THIS BUILDING. SAY THAT -- AND INVESTMENT IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT IS NOT A WISE INVESTMENT I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE. LIKE OTHER STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DO FACE COSTS FOR FOOD HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION 40% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THESE ARE WORKING CALIFORNIANS. MANY STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTING NOT ONLY THEMSELVES BUT THEIR FAMILIES. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ALREADY WORK TO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION. WHAT WE KNOW THOUGH IS THAT STUDENTS WHO NEED TO WORK EXCESSIVE HOURS TO PAY FOR THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE? ARE WORKING SO MANY HOURS AT IT IMPEDES THEIR ABILITY TO REACH OUR EDUCATIONAL GOAL AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WE NEED PARTICIPATING IN OUR WORK FORCE. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DESERVE THIS FINANCIAL AID. THEY COME FROM GROUPS THAT HAVE FACED THE HIGHEST BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY. AND THEY ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES IN A VERY RISKY ECONOMY CALIFORNIA NEEDS THEM. IN ORDER FOR US TO SUCCEED. SB TWO NINETY ONE SPECIFIES INTENT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BE INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM. I HOPE TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENACT THAT APPROPRIATION. I WANT TO BEGIN TO CLOSE BY EXPRESSING HOW MINDFUL I AM. ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS CREATED BY MORE LIMITED GROWTH IN PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT THEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS. WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA. HOWEVER I SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RACE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE DATA BEING USED IN THE FORMULA. AND A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THAT DATA -- IS ONGOING AND WILL BE COMPLETED IN MAY TO INFORM YOUR FIND AT YOUR FINAL DELIBERATIONS ON THE BUDGET. WE ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE RELIEF ON PENSION COSTS. OF THESE INCREASE PENSION COSTS ARE WREAKING HAVOC ON OUR DISTRICTS AND SO THIS RELEASE WILL ALLOW THEM TO USE THOSE RESOURCES TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR INCLUDING CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDS. TO FUND SUPPORT FIFTEEN CONTINUING PROJECT IN TWELVE NEW ONES HOWEVER. WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN ENACTING PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE THE VOTERS CALLED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAS APPROVED A TOTAL OF NINETEEN CONTINUE AND PROJECTS IN THIRTY NINE YOU PROJECTS. AND WE WISH TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO FUND THOSE PROJECTS. AND EVEN WITH MORE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY. TO IMPROVE HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER PARTICULARLY THOSE AT THE TABLE. HERE TODAY I COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ALL OF YOU WITH ALL OF YOU. AND IT'S A GOVERNOR HIS CALL FOR US TO FINALLY ACHIEVE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WE HAVE. EVEN GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ASSESSING HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING FROM CRADLE TO CAREER AND SUPPORTING HIM ALL THROUGHOUT THEIR PATH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION A LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] VERY THOROUGH -- QUESTIONS FOR OUR SEGMENTS. ALL OF A FEW. SOMEONE I REALLY MONTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU THINKS THAT TO ALL -- THREE FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK THAT THEIR COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS ANNA IN IN TE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND RELEVANCE OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING -- AS IT BUILDS OUR STUDENT POPULATION I HAVE ONE GENERAL QUESTION FOR ALL THREE OF YOU AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY -- FOR CHANCELLOR WHITE -- I'LL START UP WITH THE GENERAL QUESTIONS IT WAS NOTED AND MENTIONED THAT TO US. A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE HAVE THE ONE MILLION SHORTAGE SPOT SHORTAGE -- YOU KNOW THREE TWENTY THIRTY INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING IT TO ADDRESS THIS IN A MORE SYSTEMIC WAY AS OPPOSED TO I KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING TWO DAYS WHAT WE NEED FOR THIS YEAR. BUT IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW OVER TWENTY THIRTY WHAT DOES THAT PLAN LOOK LIKE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. OF WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO KIND OF CRAFT ON OUR OWN WHAT WE THINK AND I THINK WE DO HAVE IDEAS OF WHAT WE THINK THAT COULD LOOK LIKE. BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- AS A SYSTEM. AND IN THE SPECIFIC QUESTION I HAVE FOR CHANCELLOR -- WHITE WAS YOU MENTIONED THE DROP IN EQUITY GAP -- AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT METRICS TO USE HOW WHAT WHAT IS. THE DROP ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE AND MEASURE. SO I'M HAPPY TO BEGIN AND I'LL PASS IT OVER TO AT PRESENT ABOUT TIME NO IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'LL MENTION THREE THINGS THEY WERE DOING SPECIFICALLY. ONE WE'VE COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF OF CREDENTIALS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY 20%. ANNUALLY WE'VE ALSO COMMITTED TO INCREASING TRANSFERRED TO CSUN UC BY 35% ANNUALLY. AND WE'VE COMMITTED TO CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP CUTTING IT IN HALF. IN. OF FOUR YEARS IN COMPLETELY CLOSING IT IN. TEN CAN YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IF YOU MAY GET THE YES TO THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS YES THAT'S ON YOUR MEASURING THAT BY TWO GIRLS EARNED TIME TO DEGREE WHAT'S. SO WE'RE MEASURING THAT BY. STUDENTS COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOAL WHETHER THAT BE A CERTIFICATE DEGREE OR TRANSFER. SO RIGHT NOW WE SEE CLEAR ACHIEVEMENT ETHNIC GROUPS. ACROSS THE STATE AND SPECIFICALLY IN REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT ARE PROFOUND THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY HIGH WE'RE COMMITTED TO CLOSING THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OR WHETHER THEY'RE PURSUING A CERTIFICATE. AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE OR TRANSFER THEIR ACHIEVING THEM -- IT EQUAL RATES ACROSS RACIAL ETHNIC AS WELL AS GENDER -- LINES. YEAH THANK YOU SO AS AS I MENTIONED -- OR WE HAVE. DEVELOPED A FOUR YEAR -- FRAMEWORK -- THAT -- PROVIDES -- THAT WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES GRADUATE DEGREE -- DEGREES BOTH UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE BY -- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BY -- TWENTY THREE AND TO DO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS. IS TO REDUCE THE TIME TO GRADUATION -- SO THAT THE SIX IS GO TO FIVE IN THE FIVE TO FOUR HOURS. THAT WOULD PARTICULARLY IMPACT ARE A FIRST GENERATION PELL GRANT AND UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ARE TENDING TO TAKE LONGER TO GET THEIR DEGREES. SO AS WE IF IF WE CAN GRADUATE THEM MORE QUICKLY MOVE THE MODEL PROFESSIONAL OR GRADUATE SCHOOL OR IN THE WORKPLACE THAT OPENS UP ANOTHER SPACE FOR ANOTHER UNDERGRADUATE. SO THAT THAT'S CORRECT. SO MEMBERS LIMóN THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL QUESTIONS SO. ARE GRADUATION INITIATIVE -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT WE LAUNCHED IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN IS A OF A MULTI YEAR PLAN. OF DAD WE IMAGINED NEW INVESTMENT IN EVERY YEAR OVER THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS EACH BEING IT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. WE PRICES OUT IT'S ABOUT A OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- EFFORT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR GRADUATION RATES. DECREASE THE TIME TO DEGREE AND MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY. WE WENT INTO THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND ANALYZED INDIVIDUALLY. IN IN ALL THE FEELS OF THE THE STUDENT TIME TO DEGREE AND WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES WERE FOR IMPROVEMENT -- SO IT'S ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE IN TERMS OF THE STUDENTS OF THAT WE SERVE. AND THEN WE AGGREGATED JUST ACROSS THIS IS OF THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES HE CAME UP WITH THE SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS -- IF YOU LOOK AT OUR ABILITY TO DO OUR PIECE OF THE MILLION DOLLAR MILLION DOLLAR I WHICH IS ONLY A MILLION DOLLARS -- THE MILLION DEGREE GAP THAT THE DROUGHT THIS FACING CALIFORNIA. IS WE FEEL OUR A PORTION OF THAT IS 50%. AND SO WE PUT THIS BOTTLE TOGETHER REQUIRES TWO ELEMENTS. ONE ELEMENT IS FIRST TO CONTINUE DOING CREE AND MAGE. MEET OUR IMPROVEMENTS IN GRADUATION RATES SO. IN OF THE FOUR YEAR RATE -- FOR HALF YOUR RATE TO FIVE EVERY EVERY RATE YOU CAN MEASURE WE WANTED TO BECOME BETTER -- ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF DEGREES EARNED OVER A TIME FOR STUDENT. VERY FEW GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS THERE ARE SOME WHO CAME IN WITH A LOT OF CREDITS FROM AP COURSES AND GO YEAR ROUND AND GET HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THREE YEARS BUT THERE IS A VERY MINOR. NUMBER A LOT OF STUDENTS GET ABOUT FOUR AFTER FOUR YEARS ONE SEMESTER FOR HALF FIVES. AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS LOOKING AT DISTRIBUTION CURVE. SO OUR GOAL IS TO TAKE THAT ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION CURVE MOVING UP INTO THE LEFT. SO THE SINGLE MOM WHO'S WORKING -- FORTY HOUR WEEK AND IS ON THE SIX YEAR PLAN LET'S MAKE SURE THE UNIVERSITY HELPS HER AND SHE THAT DEGREE IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS WHAT A WONDERFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS ONE IS THIS RELENTLESS INVESTMENT IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS PART OF OUR BUDGET ASKING WHICH IS BEEN. PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THE SECOND IS TO INCREASE OUR ENROLLMENTS SO THERE'S MORE STUDENTS ACHIEVING AT A HIGHER RATE IT'S A MATHEMATICAL COMBINATION OF DOING BETTER. INTERNING DEGREE AND MORE STUDENTS HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS COME TOGETHER. WE WILL REACH THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MADE THAT THE TRUSTEES REQUEST IS. TO INVEST. HI MORE MORE HIGHLY THAN THE GOVERNOR HAS. SUGGESTED IN HIS INITIAL BUDGET WILL FUND AND ROMAN AND ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND WE'RE READY WILLING AND ABLE TO DO MORE. WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUITY GAP I THINK -- CHANCE FOR OF ORTIZ IS COMMON IT IS EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK THE YOU I POINTED OUT THAT THE EQUITY GAP IS THEIR GRADUATION RATE IN AGAIN HOWEVER YOU CALCULATED AT THE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT YEAR LEVEL. OF HIS HAS HISTORICALLY -- FOR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM. LOW INCOME. WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION AND WHO ARE THEN OFTEN OF COLOR? AND SO OUR RELENTLESS FOCUS ON IMPROVING GETTING RID OF THE EQUITY GAPS YOU KNOW THE WORD RAISING THEIR GRADUATION RATES OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO COME UP FROM THE UNDERSERVED PART OF SOCIETY. MORE THAN RAISING THE GRADUATION RATES FOR THOSE WHO COME FROM THE PROVISION OF OUR SOCIETY. WHO? DECREASES THAT AND THAT WE'VE MOVED THAT TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE NOW NO EQUITY GAPS. IN FACT STUDENTS WHO COME FROM THE UNDER REPRESENTED HERE IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVING BETTER THAN THOSE WHO COME. FROM THE MORE TRADITIONAL AREAS SO WE HAVE MADE THAT IS A SORT OF OUR MOON SHOT -- TO GET RID OF EQUITY GAPS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IT'S A IT'S A BIG LEFT. AND WE DON'T CONTROL ALL OF VARIABLES BECAUSE WE ONLY CAN DO IS WHAT. OUR STUDENTS BRING TO US AND SOME OF COME OUT A VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT TAKE MORE TIME TO ACHIEVE. THAT IS OUR MORAL COMMITMENT TO GET RID OF THE EQUITY GAP IS MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES WILL GET THEIR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- I THINK I'M STILL GRAPPLING IN ANYTHING'S ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS IN ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS. QUESTIONS I'M TRAVELING A LITTLE BIT WITH WHAT THE AVERAGE TIME TO DEGREE IS -- AND HOW. THAT FORMULATES TO MEETING THE GOAL SO IF THE AVERAGE TIME TO DEGREES FOUR POINT TWO FIVE OR FOUR POINT. SEVEN THEN HOW I MEAN ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR LIKE IT IN ORDER TO MEET THIS. BIG GAP IT JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET THAT LOWER WITHOUT THEN. IMPACT DEAN IN THE QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE. FOR STUDENTS AND I I DON'T KNOW I'M STILL GRAPPLING WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FORMULA IS. WITH OUT THEN -- IMPACT DEAN. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET LOWER THE FOUR POINT -- TWO FIVE FOUR POINT SEVEN IS NOT BAD AND SO WITH FOR GOING. ONE LOWER THAN THAT REALLY MEANS WERE DOING AN EXPEDITED. DEGREE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT CHANGES MAYBE I'M OFF MAYBE I'M NOT HEARING THE THINGS I DON'T KNOW. MEMBER NUMBER MY MY SO AT THE UNIVERSITYOF CALIFORNIA -- SIXTY SOME ODD PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. OF ABOUT 88% GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET EVERYBODY DOWN TO THAT FOUR YEAR LEVEL? AND TO DO THAT -- REQUIRES -- AND INVESTMENT -- IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL. FACULTY AND T. A.'S AN ACADEMIC ADVISORS -- AND OTHER -- PROGRAMS THAT WILL ENABLE STUDENTS -- TO SUCCEED AN HONOR FOR YOUR SIX AND IT MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE. IS THAT -- THE STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING LONGER TO GRADUATE THEY DO GRADUATE. WITH A TAKEN LONGER TO GRADUATE -- TEND TO COME. FROM THOSE WHO COME FROM DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND SO WE NEED -- TO REALLY WORK WITH THOSE STUDENTS TO GET THEM TO A FOUR YEAR GRADUATION -- A DEGREE. SO I THINK IT MEMBER ALONE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE SOMETIMES OF THE WORDS YOU GET USE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SECURE GRADUATION RATE TO DOESN'T MEAN IT TAKES A STUDENT SIX YEARS TO GRADUATE. A STUDENT WHO GOES FOR YEARS AND ONE SEMESTER. GETS COUNTED FEDERALLY IN THE IPAD'S DATABASE IS A SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT SIX YEAR MEANS SIX YEARS OR LESS. THAT'S WHY ARE -- MEDIAN TIME DEGREE IS. BASICALLY A LITTLE BIT OVER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS HALF OUR STUDENTS GET THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN FOR A HALF YEARS OR LESS. BUT THE SIX YEAR RIZZO OUR RELENTLESS FOCUS IN THE GRANT INITIATIVE. IS AND WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS IS TO RAISE THE THOSE WHO GET IN FOUR YEARS THOSE WHO GET IT FOR HALF. FIVE FIVE AND HAVE SIX AND WE CAN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS WHO COME FROM LOW INCOME. AND FIRST GENERATION AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT FOCUSING ON THAT EQUITY GAP IS A HUGE DRIVER. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE. AND DEGREE COMPLETION IS SO SIMPLE AS INSTEAD OF HAVING ADVISERS SAY. YOU KNOW WELCOME TIM I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE I KNOW YOU COME FROM LOW INCOME AND YOUR FIRST GENERATION IN YOUR IMMIGRANT KID FROM ARGENTINA. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU ONLY TAKE TELL TWELVE CREDITS. WELL SIR AS I TAKE TWELVE CREDITS. THERE'S NO WAY IN HECK I CAN GET DONE IN FOUR YEARS. SO PART OF IT IS RAISING THE EXPECTATIONS AND RATHER THAN APPROACHING STUDENTS WHO COME -- LIKE I JUST DESCRIBED AS DEFICIT MODELS WE ACTUALLY SEE THEM AS ASSETS AND THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE TO TAKE BUT TO GIVE THEM FIFTEEN CREDITS THEY HAVE TO GET THE COURSES THAT WORK AROUND THEIR WORK SCHEDULES AND AND THEY'RE PSYCH MAJOR MAKING SURE THE SECOND SEMESTER CLASSES AVAILABLE WHEN. THEY'RE READY FOR IT AND SO FORTH NATURAL THESE INVESTMENTS COME IN. A GREAT MORE CLASSES MORE FACULTY MORE ACADEMIC SUPPORT SO REGARDLESS OF THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT TO ACHIEVE WE CAN TALK OFF LINE A LITTLE BIT MORE HOW THIS MODEL WORKS. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL SET OF CONVERSATIONS OF LEAD TO THE GRAD INITIATIVE. WE'RE EXECUTING IT REQUIRES RESOURCE. AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR PITCH HERE'S TO THIS REALLY DOES MATTER FOR STUDENTS IT REALLY MATTERS FOR CALIFORNIA'S. FUTURE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS MESSAGE BUT BEFORE YOU GET THERE IT'S WHEN A NOTE THAT LAST ISSUE IS SO KEY. WITH STUDENTS WHO SHOW UP AT THE CSU. AND WE SELL AMEND LOWER EXPECTATIONS AND BUT THEY GET A CALTRANS. THE SAY FULL TIME CAL RENDER FEDERAL LOST TWELVE UNITS. MISSY ALMOST FULL TIME. BUT YOU KNOW. TWELVE UNITS PER SEMESTER DOESN'T ADD UP AND YOU RUN OUT. OF CAL GRANT MONEY IN YOUR FIFTH YEAR AND THE STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT A STUDENT LOAN AND SO WE'RE HARMING THE STUDENTS AND SELL. AND THEY'LL CHECK PRESIDENT HERE AT SAKS DATE NELSON HAS REALLY STEPPED UP. THAT IN HE'S HAVING ALL THE STUDENTS ABOUT 75% TAKING ROUGHLY FIFTEEN UNITS AS INCOMING FRESHMEN REGARDLESS OF THEIR THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND HE'S FINDING OUT THAT THEY'RE DOING WELL SO. WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT. IS GOING TO BE IN THE BILL THAT AND I ARE OFFERING THE FINANCIALLY BILL WHICH HAS YOUR IDEA BUT MORE SO WE'RE GONNA GO BIGGER THAN YOU MARS GOOD YES ONE IS ALWAYS GOOD YES. IS TO MAKE SURE WE FIND CALTRANS FOR SUMMER. YES THAT IS A IS A KEY KEEP IN THAT'S A NOW ROUGHLY AT JUST A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- PRICE TAG BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO THIS YEAR AND HIGHER AD THAT'S ON THE TOP THE LIST OF THINGS IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE YES. SO -- I WILL COME BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT LIKE CONTINUE WITH OUR MEMBERS FIRST SEMESTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- I I WANT TO START OFF ON A ON A VERY POSITIVE NO YOU KNOW I AM ALWAYS. BRAGGING TO MY CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HOW THE YOU KNOW THE BEST THING THAT WE HAVE GOING IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM INTO WHETHER OR TALK ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ARE COMMUNICABLE EDGES. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST -- ASSETS SO WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW I SEE MY JOB IS NOT ONLY. TO SUPPORT THAT AND BUT ALSO DO NOT SCREW THAT UP. THE MED SURG -- PRESIDENT A PLATANO YOU THE U. STARTING AFTER PRESENTATION BY TALKING ABOUT HOW -- YOU WILL NOT BE REQUESTING A TUITION INCREASE THIS YEAR FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BASED ON I I I ASSUME BASED ON THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET PROPOSAL -- I WANTED TO ASK CHANCE ARE WHITE AND AND CHESS OAKLEY IF YOU WOULD BE -- READY TO MAKE THAT SAME STATEMENT OR COMMITMENT -- LET'S CHECK YOUR WHITE FIRST. YEAH SO DID YOU DO JANUARY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING I MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD NOT BE RAISING TUITION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. AND THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION BY THE WAY MY ANSWER IS EASY. BECAUSE YOU SAID OUR TUITION YES. IF OR FEES AND YES WE WILL NOT BE RAISING. ANY STATE FEES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. AND SO -- YEAH I I I KNOW THAT THAT IS SO OFTEN -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS -- THAT WE HEAR FROM MARK -- IN TERMS OF THE EVER. INCREASING INCREASING COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING. TO SPENDING A LOT OF TIME HEARING MORE MORE FROM STUDENTS ABOUT HOW IT'S NOT THE TUITION IT'S THIS THE LIVING COSTS AND AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS A PART OF THE OF FINANCIAL AID REFORM THAT -- THE CHAIR AND IN CHAIRMAN MEMBER DANA ALSO OR ARE SEEKING TO ADDRESS -- I WANTED -- TO GO BACK. TO WELL -- GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE THAT -- WE WE TALKED ABOUT BRIEFLY EARLIER ABOUT -- INCREASING ACCESS -- TO THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA -- HI I NOTED IN THE LA OWES REPORT AND THAT -- IN IN FACT A FOR THE YEAR THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA HAS -- APPARENTLY. UNDERESTIMATED IN AND IS SINGS A SUBSTANTIAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH -- IN. THE UNDERGRADUATE -- ENROLLMENT -- AND SO I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR -- SPECIFIED ALLOCATION FOR THE OVER AND ROMANCE A IS THAT. IN A PAUL TANO IS THAT FUNDING GOING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OF THE OVER ENROLLMENT. IT'S PARTIALLY ADDRESSES IT BUT IN IN POINT OF FACT. WE HAVE ALL HAD -- OVER ENROLLMENT IN. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SO -- WHAT -- WE ARE ASKING IS FULL FUNDING -- FOR THE MARGINAL COSTS OF THOSE OVER AND ROLL STUDENTS OKAY. FOR THE MARGINAL COSTS OF THE OVER ROLES TO WHICH IS A ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND PER STUDENT OKAY [inaudible] BUT YOU -- ARE ALSO -- YOU YOU INDICATED THAT YOU ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ON GOING FUNDING -- AND YET YOU'RE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION ON TOP OF THAT THAT'S RIGHT UNDER FORTY MILLION THAT'S RIGHT OKAY AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS -- FOR ENROLLMENT -- AND PART OF IT -- IS -- TO CONVERT. ONE TIME MONIES THAT WERE APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR IN LIEU OF A TUITION INCREASE. INTO AN ONGOING REVENUE STREAM BECAUSE TUITION WOULD BE AN ON GOING REVENUE STREAM. AND ROUGHLY THE OTHER HALF OF THE BULK OF IT IS FOR OVER INVOLVEMENT. AND WE WANT TO INCREASE NINETEEN TWENTY AND AS WAS NOTED WE WERE IN THIS WEIRD SITUATION WHERE. ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH AND ROMAN FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO GET IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET BACK ON A CYCLE WHERE -- WE HAVE A YEAR LAG TIME -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD RIFF -- REFORM TO THE BUDGET PROCESS -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDERGRADUATE AND ONE THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHEN WE NEED ENROLLMENT FUNDING FOR THAT. WHY WHY WITH THE THE COSTS OF THE? ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDERGRADS AND AT THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. NOT BE COVERED BY THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION AND THE NEW ON GOING FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- OF THE BILL -- BECAUSE THEY GET THE GOVERNOR SPECIFIED WHAT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY WOULD BE USED FOR AND HE DID NOT INCLUDE THE ENROLLMENT IN THAT NUMBER. BUT I I THINK AS WE INDICATED TO OR AT LEAST AS I INDICATED EARLIER -- WHILE THAT -- IS TAKING A BIG THE GOVERNOR SPECIFICATION. I I THINK IT'S UP TO THE LEGISLATURE FINE -- OUR PRIORITIES AND I THINK THAT -- TO AT LEAST IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE -- CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZED. ACCESS AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT -- WELL AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OF OF OF THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR CURRENT STUDENTS -- I A YEAH I I THINK I I I KNOW THAT YOUR YOUR STAFF HAD -- TO COME TO MY OFFICE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN [inaudible] YOU KNOW [inaudible] YOUR SIGNIFICANT -- GA REQUEST IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE VERY PLEASED THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND SO I LOOK -- FOR TO GETTING MORE DETAILS ON HOW EXACTLY -- THOSE DOLLARS ARE -- TO BE JUSTIFIED THANK YOU ARE GOOD. MR DONNA BUT BEFORE I DO THAT THING IS GOING TO ASK YOU TO MY QUESTION JUMPING OFF THE OF OF YOU GUYS SO. I THINK THAT HE JUST HIT THE ISSUE IS THAT. THERE THE PRIORITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TAX FINANCE PEOPLE LAID OUT WOULD YOU GIVE THEM A LIST OF ROUGHLY TEN THINGS AND THEY FUNDED SEVEN OR SO. AND SO THIS ONE WAS NOT ON THE TO THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS OUGHT TO US MOST ABOUT. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO TO PORTION SO WHETHER WE GET LUCKY FIND TWENTY FIVE MILLION. NEW IN MAY. OR LOOK AT OTHER -- EXPENDITURES NAY JANUARY BUDGET THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND MAKE SURE WE WE ADDRESS THIS YEAR. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS -- BEEN IN ROLLING A RECORD NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES THAT'S A GOOD THING -- WHAT HASN'T BEEN SO GOOD AS WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING THE ENROLLMENT FUNDING TO COVER ALL THOSE NEW STUDENTS AND OVER TIME THAT WILL AFFECT QUALITY YOU MEAN THE MARGINAL COST ISN'T IT? THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE REALLY NEED THIS COMMITTEE -- IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT -- TO TO REALLY LOOK AT THE FUNDING TO COVER THAT ENROLLMENT LET ME JUST MAKE SURE REQUIRE CLEAR IN THIS ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE AMOUNT PER STUDENT. IS IT IS AN ACCURATE OR IN PRIOR YEARS PRIOR YEARS WE HAVEN'T COVERED -- THE MARGINAL COST OF THE MARGINAL COST YES THE DIFFERENCE COUPLE THOUSAND PER STUDENT. TEN THOUSAND NOT THAT WE WERE HAVING A TENER SELLING YOU SAY IT'S TEN THE MARGINAL COST THE STATE PORTION OF MARCIA COST IS -- TEN THOUSAND PER STUDENT YEAH. NOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE UC A SAYING THAT OUR CALCULATION FOR THE MARGINAL COST US OFF BY TEN OR SO PERCENT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE PRIOR YEARS WE DIDN'T COVER THE STATE SHARE AND AS YOU KNOW MISTER TING KNOWS. WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE UC TO DO SOME RE DIRECTIONS IN PRIOR YEARS AND THAT WAS. ACCOUNTED FOR AND I THINK THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ARGUED THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE COVERED ALL THAT BUT THOSE WERE OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE MAY IN THE PAST BY TWO YEARS. WE WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. YES YOU CAN GET IT ASK FOR MORE THAT'S YOUR JOB. YES THANK YOU -- MISTER WAS IT MEDINA O'DONNELL MISTER O'DONNELL THANKS. YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A TWO THIRDS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA LIVING ON THE SEVENTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. RIGHT THERE -- BUT CLEAR JUST I JUST WANT TO QUIT COMING HERE YOU I'M MOVING BY THE WAY. THAT YET [inaudible] BUT I I KNOW I I APPRECIATE LISTEN THIS THIS LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE YOU YOU KNOW TO TO ADDRESS THREE THINGS REALLY VOLUME. THE NUMBER STUDENTS GENERAL VELOCITY. HOW FAST YOU GET THEM THROUGH AND ALSO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT BUDGET UNDER VERY? TIGHT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS JUST ONE CONCERN I WANT 2% IS. I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD YEAH I I WANNA SHOULD TO ANY POTENTIAL STUDENT BY THIS DEMAND THAT THEY DO IT IN FOUR YEARS. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT FOR EVERY STUDENT IT WASN'T FOR ME IT TOOK ME. SEVEN RIGHT FIVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO TO THE CSU -- YOU KNOW THAT'S I JUST HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT BUYING INTO THAT JERRY BROWN MANTRA THAT EVERY. PERSON THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FROM LET'S BE HONEST AND THAT WAS HIS LIFE EXPERIENCE. RIGHT HE HAD -- HE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT GIVEN YOU KNOW WHAT GOD GAVE HIM AND AND SOME MORE TO GET THROUGH VERY QUICKLY. AND AND I THINK THAT. THE DEMAND THAT WE DO THAT IN THAT EVERY STUDENT DO THAT I THINK SAID CAN IMPOSE OUR VALUES ON THEM. BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE A VARIETY OF LIFE EXPERIENCES I COME FROM HIGH SCHOOL. WHERE A LOT OF OUR KIDS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THEIR THEIR AYE LOW INCOME POPULATION GREAT KIDS SOME OF GREAT CHALLENGES? AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE ACCOMMODATING THERE NEEDS. TO AND NOT JUST TELLING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIETY DEMANDS -- DEMANDS YOU KNOW FROM THE HOME FRONT WHERE THEY THEY MIGHT BE FINANCIALLY MIGHT HAVE KIDS. AND I I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I LEAVING THEM OUT TO DRY ARE NOT INVITING THEM IN. TO FURTHER AT THEIR EDUCATION I I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME BUT I THINK THE EVEN THIS COMMITTEE REALLY NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE UC STUDENTS PROBABLY VERY WELL GEARED TO DO IT FOR YEARS ON AVERAGE AND IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH HAPPEN NOW. THAT WHEN WE GO TO THE TO THE TO THE TO THE TO THE TO THE CSU NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY BRING YOU KNOW PROBABLY MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE I'LL BE BLUNT WITH YOU. AND THEN CERTAINLY ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FRIENDS I JUST DOES THIS COMMITTEE COLLEGE WHO ARE AS IS COMMITTEE MOVES TOWARD. I THINK WE WE NEED -- TO REALLY THINK ABOUT DIVERSITY WITH A LOT OF DIVERSE SITUATIONS AND NOT EVERY STUDENT COMES OUT AT EIGHTEEN AND IT'S GONNA KNOCK IT OUT IN FOUR YEARS AND QUITE FRANKLY MAYBE THEY SHOULD. SO WE JUST NEED TO KEEP AVENUES OPEN FOR THEM AS WELL NUMBER DONALD I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT I I THINK MY RESPONSE TO TWO MEMBERS SEEM LAME Là MORE ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION CURVE IS EXACTLY RIGHT. NO THERE'S A FAMILY I KNOW WHO'S OUR RUNNER VERY SUCCESSFUL WEALTH BUSINESS IN SEAL BEACH. AND THEY ONLY HIRE CAL STATE STUDENTS WHO'VE TAKEN AT LEAST SIX YEARS -- HONORED AGREE. AND THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS THOSE STUDENTS HAVE GREAT. THEY HAVE PERSEVERANCE THEY HAVE A DREAM IN A WILLING TO WORK HARD AND THEY HAVE MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE. AND SO YOU KNOW THE STUDENT BODY IS NOT A MONOLITH. ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. AND IS MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ACTUALLY PREFER STUDENTS WHO'VE. GONE THROUGH SOME MORE BEFORE THEY'RE READY. TO AND THEY HAVE FANTASTIC SUCCESS WITH THAT SO TO YOUR POINT. IF I CAN ADD TO THAT INSTANTLY MOVING TO YOUR DISTRICT MEMBER O'DONNELL I COULD PROBABLY SAY THIS NOW. BUT JUST REPRESENTATION WITHOUT NO DOUBT IN MY IN FLORIDA. BUT BUT I WE CERTAINLY DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT POINT OF VIEW AND AND YOU AND I BOTH HAD I'M A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THAT. LASTED MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AND WITH THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY -- BUT WHAT WE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT [inaudible] OUR EITHER. DESIGN ISSUES WITHIN OUR COLLEGE OR ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS DON'T HAVE. THAT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE IT TAKES THEM LONGER THAN. THEY WOULD OTHERWISE WANT -- TO IN SO -- IF A STUDENT NEEDS TO TAKE FIVE YEARS TO TAKE SIX YEARS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE THERE FOR THEM AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. IN OUR POWER TO HELP THEM GET TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE OF THE ARTIFICIAL OR ARBITRARY OF THINGS THAT WE DO AS COLLEGES. THAT PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING TO THAT EDUCATIONAL GOALS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IS THE ONLY THING I'D SAY IN ADDITION IS. A YOU KNOW SOME STUDENTS WANT TO FINISH AND SOME STUDENTS NEED TO FINISH THE SOONER THEY GET INTO THE ECONOMY THE BETTER IT IS FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO WE WANT TO WE WANT TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. I THINK YOU'RE NOT WRONG BUT YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY CORRECT -- AGAIN BECAUSE I I REALLY REALLY GO BACK TO STUDENTS HAVING DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES -- EXPECTATIONS ON THEIR DAILY LIFE I'D RATHER HAVE A A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN COMPLETED AGREE AND SEVEN YEARS AND BE HEALTHY. THANK COMPLETELY AGREE IN FIVE YEARS AND NOT BE HEALTHY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AS WE SHAPE OUR POLICIES IN AS WE ALIGN OUR FUNDING THAT WE'RE NOT PUSHING PEOPLE TO HARD. AS ALWAYS IT'S THEIR CHOICE. THEIR CHOICE I GET THAT BUT AGAIN THE LETTER WRITER CHOICE OR THEY'RE NOT AT NOT BE OUR MANDATE. MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO. FIRST -- FOR PRESIDENT PAULA TANTO -- IN DOLLAR. THAT IS OUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR DEGREE ATTAINMENT AND STUDENT SUCCESS. YES WE WERE KIND OF TALK ALLUDING TO EARLIER I MEAN YOU GUYS ARE KIND OF ALREADY. MEDIAN THE DEGREE ATTAINMENT -- ME AS FAR AS SOMEOF THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD SO HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE USING. THAT FIFTY MILLION THAT'S IN THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO EACH CAMPUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE GRADUATION OF FOUR YEAR IN RATES ARE MUCH HIGHER AT BERKELEY AND UCLA THEN SAY YOU SEE OR YOU SEE -- MERCED. OF SO -- EACH CAMPUS HAS -- SUBMITTED -- PLANS FOR US AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD DO. TO FACILITATE AND HELP THERE'S STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS -- WHICH SOME OF THEM IT'S THINGS LIKE SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAMS -- IT INCLUDES ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND INCLUDES. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTORS -- SOMETIMES IT IT MEANS OPENING UP MORE CLASS SECTIONS SO THAT THERE'S CLASS AVAILABILITY. IT'S REALLY A CAMPUS SPECIFIC SET OF PLANS [inaudible] OKAY -- AND THEN EMAIL. DESPITE. IT WOULD BE GOOD AS WE GET FURTHER ALONG TO SEE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT LIKE I SEE THE GENERAL OUTLINES THERE BUT HE HAS A SAID WHAT KIND OF MEDIAN THAT. HERE AND I AND MY I THINK THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE NATURALLY ASK IS HEY WOULD THAT BE BETTER SPENT MAYBE ON THE MAY BE IN CS YOU -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HELPING THEM WITH. YES SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE TRYING TO DO IN TERMS OF DEGREE ATTAINMENT -- BUT THEN GET INTO THAT YOU KNOW WE GO YEAH THAT'S ALREADY IN THE BUDGET PROPOSED BUDGET FOR YOU. BEFORE ASKING FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION. ON TOP OF THE TWO OR FORTY MILLION THAT'S ALREADY PROPOSES ONGOING FUNDING. THE LAW THAT IS ON ON A ROAMING GROWTH AND THIS IS JUST. THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY GOING BEYOND. YEAH YOU'RE OUR PULLING BEYOND THE MASTER PLAN IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT -- WEIRD YOU'RE ACTUALLY OVER APPROPRIATING -- IN TERMS OF YOUR COMING BACK AND SAYING OKAY WE WENT OVER. THAT AMOUNT -- AND AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY THAT'S YEAH REALLY OCCURRING BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING OVER THERE AND AND AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME. SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT WE'VE BEEN THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST AT LEAST FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. STILL ARE BEING MET IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT A RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS -- IN STATE STUDENTS AND CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO BASICALLY JUST. RIGHT A BLANK CHECK THE YEAR AFTER I'LL GET ALL BE AT THE YEAR AFTER FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR YOU SEE -- YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD WE TREAT YOU ANY DIFFERENT ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M NOT SEEN. YOU KNOW. WE'RE NOT MEETING THOSE BENCHMARKS FOR ENROLLING IN STATE STUDENTS -- AND WE'RE NOT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. ALL MEMBER GALLAGHER I I'M NOT SURE. WHAT YOU MEAN BY WE'RE NOT? MEETING -- THE BENCHMARK FOR ENROLLING IN STATE STUDENTS UNDER THE MASTER PLAN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA PERCENT IS TO ENROLL TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE FROM THE TOP TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND WE'RE TAKING FROM THE TOP. OF THIRTEEN POINTS. THREE YEARS WELL WELL BEYOND -- THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN -- WE ARE OVER AND ROLLED BECAUSE THE OUR YIELD FROM OFFERS OF ADMISSIONS HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED THERE'S A GREAT DEMAND TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- TO GET A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DEGREE -- AND WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I THINK PART OF IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS MISMATCH. BETWEEN WHEN -- THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE BUDGET. AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY AND ADMIT STUDENTS SO WERE. SO YOU'RE SETTING A BUDGET FOR NINETEEN TWENTY NOW -- AND THOSE ADMISSION DECISIONS ARE ALREADY BEING MADE. WE REALLY SHOULD BE TALING ABOUT ENROLLMENT HERE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO TO GIVE US -- TARGETS BIG IS PART SCIENCE AND IT'S PART PART AND WE HAVE MODELS AND WE TRY -- TO IN ROLE THE NUMBER THAT WE THINK WE'LL GET FUNDING. FOR BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND. WE JUST HAVE BEEN OVERRULED THE LAST FEW YEARS. RABBIT CSU HANDLES THAT ISSUE ZERO WEIGHTLESS SYSTEM RIGHT AND THEY THEY TURN AWAY STUDENTS AND BUT ESSENTIALLY COME BACK TO US IT MAY REVISE AND SAY HEY HERE'S WHO WE BLOOD IN. AND WE'VE GOT AN ESTABLISHED NUMBER FOR ENROLLMENT WELL WE FUND WE'VE TRIED THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON SUCCESSFULLY. WELL OF THE WORKS WITH CSU I DON'T REALLY SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK IN THE UC SYSTEM BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO I MEAN LET'S LET'S SEE SOME THE NECESSARY NEEDS TO CONSIDER. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS CAPACITY WHAT DO WE KNOW. WHERE WE ARE AT CAPACITY IN THE UC SYSTEM? A WHICH CAMPUSES HAVE CAPACITY TO GROW. WE STILL DON'T HAVE AS SEEMS LIKE WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US TODAY. SO THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES HAVE DIFFERENT -- CAPACITY AND AND DIFFERENT POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH -- SOME OF THE CAMP -- A UC BERKELEY ARE VERY CONSTRAINED THEY'RE CONSTRAINED GEOGRAPHICALLY -- AMONGST OTHER THINGS OTHER CAMPUSES CAN CONTINUE TO GROW MERCED IS GROWING RIVERSIDE IS GROWING -- UC SAN DIEGO IS GROWING -- AND SO. WE WE CAN PROVIDE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH WHERE WE SEE THE GROWTH OCCURRING ACROSS THE UC CAMPUSES. WELL IN THE END JUST JUST FOR ME YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME CONTINUE TO IMPROVE YOU APPROVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT YOU SEE WITHOUT REALLY. TO ME HAVING SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ON ON THESE ISSUES THAT I KNOW OF HAVE CONTINUALLY COME UP -- AND YEAH SO FOR ME YOU KNOW -- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GO THROUGH A BUDGET AND SAY AND JUST CONTINUE TO ESSENTIALLY. RIGHT THAT BLANK CHECK -- MORE MEMBER WE OFFER ADMISSION. ANY STUDENT WHO MEETS OUR ELIGIBILITY QUALIFICATIONS TAKE THE A TO G. CLASSES [inaudible] HAVE A THREO IN THOSE -- A TO G. CLASSES AND TAKE EITHER THE SAT OR THE A. C. T.. WHAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IS OFFER ADMISSION NECESSARILY TO THE CAMPUS OF CHOICE FOR THAT STUDENT? BUT WE DO OFFER ADMISSION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ALL QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. RIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT I'M JUST SAYING THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE ON A AND TO GET A A DEFINED NUMBER OF WHAT THAT IS. AS WE DO AND THE OTHER CAMPUSES AS WE DO IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM -- SO FOR CHANCER WHITE I DID HAVE A QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S AND INDICATED HIS INTENT FOR SOME OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNNY TO BE UTILIZED FOR CHILD CARE FACILITIES ON CAMPUS -- YOU'LL. MAKE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE DO WE KNOW HOW MANY THIS IS HAVE CHILD CARE FACILITIES -- AND WOULDCSU BE LOOKING AT UTILIZING THE FUNNY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OR FOR THE EXPANSION OF CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN A BECAUSE AS YOU SAID WE HAVE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT. VARIOUS LIFE EXPERIENCES ATTENDING SCHOOLS AND YES IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT COMES UP. SO MEMBER GALLAGHER THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION -- ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE HAVE SOME WEATHER TO CHILD CARE CENTER OR SOME WAY. TO PROVIDE A CHILD CARE FOR OUR STUDENTS IN SOME PLACES ARE EMPLOYEES -- BUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY DONE ON A SELF SUPPORT BASIS -- OR AN ENTERPRISE ONE ORIGINAL REASONS REALLY NOT STATE FACILITIES OR STATE RESOURCES SUPPORTING THE STAFF THAT WORK THERE. SO THE THE REMAINING ONE THIRD HAVE OF CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE TIED IN WITH OUR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS OR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS MAY GO AS LEARNING PROCESS TO WORK WITH THESE YOUNGSTERS IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS THEN OF TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE THAT -- OF FALL UNDER THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. CAPABILITY TO SEE TO WHAT EXTENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR EXPANSION THOSE FACILITIES ARE NECESSARY. SO I THINK THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WILL HAVE A BETTER ANSWER FOR YOU BEFORE YOU GET TO THE END OF THE THE BUDGET PROCESS SO HERE IN THE SPRING WE'RE DOING AN INVENTORY ON THE STATE. CONTROL PARTS OF THE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE THE MAJORITY OF THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR WILL BE GOING TO THE ACADEMIC SIDE OF THE CAMPUS -- BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER YET FOR THE CHILD CARE PEAS -- IT IS IMPORTANT AGAIN WITH A POINTED MEMBER O'DONNELL AND OTHERS RAISING WITH. A WITH SOME OF OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE A MORE OF LIFE TO MANAGE IN ADDITION TO GOING TO SCHOOL. THAT OF THESE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN HELP REDUCE BARRIERS AND SO THEY GET TO THEIR CLASS. EXETER SO WE'LL BE GETTING MORE REFINED DATA TO YOU BUT OVER ON THE OVERALL SPEND OF THE TWO FORTY SEVEN A SMALL PIECE OF IT. BUT IMMEASURABLE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OKAY. I WILL MEMO CONTINUE AS WE GET FURTHER INTO BUT I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND THEN LAST QUESTION SORRY MISTER CHAIRMAN -- FOR CHANCELLOR OAKLEY ON THE ON THE PROMISE PROGRAM -- ARE THERE ANY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS YOU KNOW GETTING KIND OF INTO THIS PERFORMANCE METRIC AGAIN. ARE THERE ANY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS CURRENTLY TO INDICATE THAT THE PROMISE PROGRAM IS TO FILL IN ITS GOAL WELL IT'S AS FAR AS A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE FROM IS IT'S DIFFICULT TO BEGIN TO SEE THE OUTCOMES BECAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS LAST BUDGET. THAT THE AB NINETEEN WAS FUND. SO THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION NOW. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU? IS WHERE COLLEGE PROMISE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WHETHER IN LONG BEACH OR IN OF INTER -- OR IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE NUMBER. OF LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THEIR CSU WE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT SEAMLESSLY TRANSFER TO THEIR LOCAL CSU AND THAT THE GRADUATION RATES OF THOSE TRANSFER STUDENTS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. WE'VE SEEN THAT -- THIS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE THAT THERE DOLLARS ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO COVERING THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE NOT THE COST OF TUITION. SO UNDER THOSE MEASURES WE WHICH WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE WILL HAVE SIMILAR RESULTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND BE HAPPY TO BE. TO BRING YOU THOSE -- OUTCOMES IN IN FUTURE YEARS I MEAN THAT ARE YOU GUYS PLANNING TO DEVELOP CERTAIN METRICS AND TRACKING OKAY THESE ARE STUDENTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ATTENDED -- NEO COMMUNITY COLLEGE THERE NOW DOING IT BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND THEN TRACKING. OKAY AND DO THEY GET TO WRITE. THE CREDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE RIGHT -- JUST SO THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND GO OKAY YOU KNOW HEY THIS IS ACTUALLY. YEAH FOR FILLING RIGHT AT THE POLICY GOAL THAT I THINK WAS BEHIND THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WELL I'D SAY WE ALREADY HAVE SEVERAL MEASURES IN PLACE -- THAT WE ARE -- THAT I'VE MENTIONED SO FOR EXAMPLE -- DECREASING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT EXISTS WE THINK THAT. IF IMPLEMENTED WELL THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISED -- INITIATIVE WILL -- ADVANCES EFFORTS BECAUSE FOR A COLLEGE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FUNDS THEY HAVE TO BE PUT INTO PLACE THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND HAVE TO BE. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AID THAT GOES TO THOSE FOUR YEAR COLLEGE PROMISES PART OF AN UMBRELLA OF A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES. AIMED TO REDUCE THOSE GAPS SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD WANT TO SEE THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COMING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- NETTLE INCREASE BY INCREASE IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY AN INCREASE IN TERMS OF THEIR OUTCOME SO THOSE ARE CERTAINLY MEASURES THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE. WOULD INCREASE AND THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW -- ACROSS OUR SYSTEM WHEN THAT THAT SOME I WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE WE COULD SEE IN SOME FUTURE HEARINGS IS JUST HOW THOSE ARE BEING DIRECT AND OBVIOUSLY I REALIZE IN THIS IS JUST GET ENOUGH THE GROUND -- BUT I'LL SEE FOR ME I THINK YOU GUYS CAN ALSO BE -- ACCOUNTABILITY AND IN PERFORMANCE AND HOW THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY UTILIZE IN ARE WE GETTING. THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT IS IMPORTANT TO ME SO. ABSOLUTELY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU I I HAVE A MY FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT. JUST A QUICK ONE FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS IS THAT. WE'LL TALK MORE IN A CAR HEARING ABOUT THAT THE PROMISE PROGRAM. BUT THERE WAS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT I THINK BY. IT'S SOURCE OR CAL MATTERS ONE OF THAT PUBLICATION'S RECENTLY. THEY DID THEIR OWN SURVEY SURVEY RIGHT THE COLD CALLED OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AT THE YOU KNOW TWO DOZEN DISTRICTS AND FOUND SOME INTRIGUING -- EXPENDITURES AND I'M NOT SURE I THINK IT JUST WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION SO I'M ASKING YOU. TO COME BACK AND BE PREPARED AS MISTER GALLAGHER SAID TO TALK ABOUT WE SUPPORT THE THE AYE THAT THE PROGRAM AT YOUR REQUEST WE PUT IN SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY NOT JUST. FREE BUT HAVE SOME YOU KNOW GUIDED PATHWAYS OTHER ELEMENTS TO SUCCESS WHICH TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DOING WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND IF NECESSARY. POTENTIALLY -- TINKER WITH THAT. SO -- I WANNA ASK BRIEFLY ON WHAT MISTER GALLAGHER ASKED YOU PRESENT BUILT ON ON THAN NON RESIDENT STUDENT ISSUE. YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW WORKED OUT THIS ISSUE AND FRANKLY BATTLE THIS ISSUE FOR A FEW YEARS BUT PUT THE ISSUE TO REST. CHECK CHECK HIRED CHAIRMAN DENIED -- WORK TO LEGISLATION WEIRD SUPPORT OF MR TING AND I WORKED WITH YOUR TEAM TO COME UP WITH. AN ACCORD THAT THE REGENTS -- ADOPTED IN WHICH YOU THINK IS IS A FAIR PLAN I KNOW THE SENATE NOW IS ASKING TO CONSIDER GOING DOWN 210% -- NON RESIDENT SO WE LOOK FORWARD. TO SOME OF THE THIS IS -- EXCEEDED THE THE THAT NICK NUMERIC NUMBER WHICH WE SET IN PLACE AS AS A FAIR. MIDDLE GROUNDS AND THAT THAT WASN'T WHAT WE HAD. READ UPON. AS FAR AS A STATE POLICY AND I ASSUME THAT YOU WORK -- PLEASE BY THAT AND SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK AS FAR AS HOW WE GOT HERE AND AND HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WENT TO KEEP CREEPING CREEPING UP FOR A REASON. YEAH I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT CANNOT BE ABOUT IT EITHER IT'S MISTER CHAIR -- THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES -- BERKELEY YOU SHOWING DAVIS EXCEEDED THEIR AGREED UPON -- CAP NOW BY A SMALL AMOUNTS ALL LESS THAN 1%. OF AND SO -- TO AND IN PART OF THAT IS AS I WAS. MENTIONING THE MEMBER GALLAGHER ADMISSIONS IS PART ART PART SCIENCE AND AND YOU YOU TRY TO GET THE OFFERS OF ADMISSION AND THE YIELD TO MARRY UP WITH THE AGREED UPON CAP AND THOSE THREE CAMPUSES WENT A BIT OVER. TO REMOVE ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE -- FOR CAMPUSES -- TO EXCEED THEIR AGREED UPON CAP. OF WE ARE GOING -- TO RETAIN IN TUITION THE THOSE CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE RECEIVE. AND DISTRIBUTE THEM SYSTEM WIDE TO BASIC NEEDS FOR OUR UNDERGRADUATES. GOOD SOLUTION. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE NON RESIDENT TUITION WE'RE VERY ADVERSE TO INCREASING FEES FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT FOR YEAH WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING WE HAD DIFFERENT OPINIONS -- THERE'S BEEN CONCERN THAT IF WE KEEP INCREASING AND NON RESIDENT TUITION. THERE'D BE A DECLINING PEOPLE PLAYING. BUT WE'VE WE'VE HAD THESE INCREASES I THINK THREE LASTS FOR YEARS MAYBE FOR LAST. FOUR YEARS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH OF A DECLINE THERE'S A BIT OF A DECLINE IN YOU KNOW. THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT IT WAS THE PRESIDENCY DECLARE WHAT HAVE YOU BUT WE WE SEEN IT SOMEWHAT FLAT AND SO. IS THAT POTENTIALLY ON THE TABLE TO CONTINUE. TO INDEX THAT. FEE AND USE THAT MONEY FOR POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA IN A MOMENT YES WE'RE GOING TO BE. ASKING THE BOARD OF REGENTS NEXT WEEK TO APPROVE A TWO POINT 6% INCREASE TO THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION -- WHICH BASICALLY HOLDS THEM ON RESIDENTS IN TUITION FLAT IN TERMS OF CONSTANT DOLLARS AND INDEXING WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. BUT THOSE. NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION -- TO THE CAMPUS THE ONE I GO. TO FIVE AND THEN USE THAT. TO TO MAKE SURE WE CAN EXPAND SOME MORE SLOTS AT EACH OF THE NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES ARE BECAUSE WE'RE VERY CONSCIOUS THAT WE'RE REACHING -- A PRICE POINT THAT'S MY POINT IS WE DID INCREASE A ONE YEAR EIGHT ONE YOU'RE. FIVE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A DROP OF PEOPLE STILL CONTINUE TO APPLY. BUT I THINK IT IS -- THE RECORD THE RECOMMENDATION THAT -- NINE RESIDENTS IN TUITION UNDER THE TWO POINT 6% PLAN WILL BE GOING UP SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX DOLLARS IT'LL BE OVER. FORTY ONE THOUSAND AT THAT POINT -- AND WERE REALLY CLOSE TO SOME OF THE THE PRIVATE YOUR TEAM COME BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT -- WARRANTS FURTHER. EVALUATION. ZERO OKAY I WITH THAT. MR TING. THANK YOU MISTER SO -- JUST AS START WITH TRANSFER OAKLEY -- WITH APPRECIATE ALTHOUGH ALL THE WORK THAT NOT JUST THE CHANCE OKAY BUT ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE DONE A REGARDING THE TRANSFER STUDENT RATE I KNOW THAT -- THAT DID PUT SOME SOME PRESSURE ON ALL THE SYSTEMS AND JUST WANTED. TO HEAR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE HOW THE GIVEN THE SORT OF A TWO ONE RATIO THAT WAS SENT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. A SO -- YEAH I I'M I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT -- PRESIDENT APOLLO TUNNEL AND I SIGNED -- ANIMAL YOU RECENTLY. TO CONTINUE OUR WORK AROUND TRANSFER AND PARTICULARLY AROUND -- LOOKING AT NOT ONLY HOW WE INCREASE TRANSFER HOW WE USE EXISTING ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CSU. TO FOLD THAT INTO THE UC AS WELL I KNOW THAT -- THE ECONOMIC CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE YOUR CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT THAT AND WORKING WITH US SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL. COME TO FRUITION -- CLEARLY -- CAPACITY AT THE CSU AND THE UC ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN -- AN APPROPRIATE MANDATE TO IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO TRANSFER FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WERE HOPEFUL THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO PUSH ON THOSE TRANSFER THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ROOM AT THE INN AT THE CSU IN THE UC. NOW WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH A I SEE SEE YOU -- TO SIGN AN ANIMAL YOU WITH THEM AS WELL -- AND WE NEED THEM TO INCREASE OUR TRANSFER CAPACITY AS WELL BECAUSE IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING TRANSFER AS WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO BE -- WE NEED ALL THE SEGMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ROOM SO -- OUR COLLEGES ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO. THEY'RE INCREASING THE PREPAREDNESS OF OUR STUDENTS THEY'RE GOING TO PREPARE THEM TO TRANSFER IN LARGER NUMBERS SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WILL MAKE SURE AND HAVE THE TRANSFER CAPACITY THAT WE NEED. NO IT'S GREAT ÁI DIçN I JUST MET WITH SOME YOU KNOW. HIS HISTORIC ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH CITY COLLEGES SEVERANCE RECORDS SO I THINK -- THERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF MODELS OUT THERE. TO TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN -- I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SEPARATE HEARING ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THAT -- WOULD LOVE YOUR EYES YOUR TEAM CAN PREPARE TO THE HEARING REALLY TRY TO GET AS MUCH ROBUST FEEDBACK ON HOW THAT'S GOING. ESPECIALLY BY COLLEGE BY REGION SEEING SEEING REALLY -- WHAT SUCCESS STORIES ARE OUT THERE I THINK I WANT ONE OF THE -- IT WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF SUCCESS. IN THE MORE URBAN PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE WE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THERE AREN'T AS MANY SUCCESS STORIES IN THE MORE INLAND PART OF THE STATE. SO WITH SO WE CONTINUE TO BE VERY INTERESTED. TO SEE -- HOW DO HOW DO WE LINK THE AS ECONOMICALLY AS A SHIP? SO -- YEAH THAT'S JUST A JUST A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM. CANCER LIKE YOU YOU AND I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY WHEN YOU CAN STOP BY THE OFFICE. ON THE AND JUST AND JUST TO SORT OF STATE FOR THE RECORD I KNOW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN. SORT OF ASKING FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE THIRTY THOUSAND CSU ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. WHO -- HAVEN'T FOUND A HOME WITHIN THE SYSTEM WE REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU AND THEN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WORKING WITH US. TO ESTABLISH A REDIRECTION POLICY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE UC HAS AND REALLY AS I KIND OF REITERATE EARLIER TODAY REALLY HOPE THAT THE SYSTEM CAN BE MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE. ON HOW TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER THAT NUMBER STARTED AT FIRST DURING THE THE BUDGET CUTS THAT THAT WERE FAIRLY DRACONIAN -- BUT BE GIVEN GIVEN THE LAST. SIX YEARS -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S CONCERNING THAT THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN MUCH MOVEMENT OFF THAT NUMBER WHEN. I I KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE THERE'S BEEN -- SOURCE TESTIMONY SAYING HEY WE'RE WE WE'VE GOT UNDER CONTROL FOR MAKING PROGRESS. AND DO JUST WANT TO ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY OR JUST COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH -- AND I APPRECIATE I THINK THE THE REDIRECTION POLICY YOU KNOW WE ARE. INSTITUTING AT THIS YEAR SO COME APRIL FIRST -- WILL BE WHEN WE KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE APPLIED TO THEIR THERE ARE CHOICES ARE GETTING IN. OF A WILL BE CONTACTED AND GIVEN THIRTY FIVE DAYS I THINK IN ORDER. TO TAKE OTHER CAMPUSES THERE IN OUR REGION. IF THEY DON'T RESPOND A THIRTY FIVE DAYS WILL PICK'EM FORUM AND LET THEM KNOW -- AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO TRY AND GET THEM TO GO WE DO KNOW THAT A STUDENT WHO CAN'T GET INTO LONG BEACH STATE -- FOR FAMILY OR ECONOMIC REASONS MAY NOT WANT TO GO OR BE ABLE TO GO TO HUMBLE STATE WHERE THERE'S ROOM -- SO THERE ARE SOME REGIONAL CONSTRAINTS THAT WE WILL FIND OUT. WHO WERE WERE ENTHUSED ABOUT THIS -- REDIRECTION POLICY WE RETAIN SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT -- WERE AWARDED LAST YEAR THE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ENROLLMENT FUNDING. TO BE SPENT OVER FOUR YEARS AT ONE TIME FUNDING OVER FOUR YEARS. SO WE'VE WE'VE DISTRIBUTED SOME OF THAT A RESOURCES THIS YEAR WHICH HAS BEEN TERRIFIC. BUT WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE WE HAVE HERE. A WITH RESPECT REDIRECTION IS GOING TO BE THIS OR IS IT GOING TO BE THIS. AND SO WERE WILL BE ABLE TO WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT MONEY FOLLOWS THE STUDENTS WHO MOVE TO ANOTHER CAMPUS. THE OTHER PART I THINK OF THE OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND IS THAT OF THE NUMBER OF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE OF GOT UP. AND WITH ADMITTED. VIED OFFERS OF ADMISSION TO MORE STUDENTS HE'S GOT LIKE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HERE YOU KNOW WE SPEND MONEY ON IT BUT THE DEFERRED MEANS KEEPS GOING UP AND SO. AS PART OF WHY THAT THIRTY THOUSAND NUMBER EBBS AND FLOWS -- OF THAT THIRTY THOUSAND NUMBER THERE'S SOME AGO BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR SOME WILL GO. TO A PRIVATE GROUP OR GO OUT OF STATE OF EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND SOON TO ACTUALLY GO INTO A BLACK HOLE AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA IS A GOOD FOR ANYBODY AYE. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER HERE SO I APPRECIATE THE POINT. NO I THINK IT'S DISTANT SO I CALLED BACK ON MY COLLEAGUE MISTER DOWN ON INTO THE WHOLE POINT IS JUST TO GIVE THAT PERSON CHOICES OBVIOUSLY IF YOU MAKE AN OFFER THEY CHOOSE NOT TO THAT'S THEIR COMPLETE RIGHT A BIT THE DUST. HERE WE'RE TRYING TO FULFILL OUR RESPONSIBILITY INTO THE MASTER PLAN. ON TO TO FOLLOW UP FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLS JUST DISCUSSION ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I KNOW THAT. YOU WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MY IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OR GUESTS AND THIS THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR'S BUDGET. DO YOU CAN YOU -- TELL US HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT OR MAYBE YOUR STAFF CAN FOLLOW UP WITH WITH A LIST OF WHERE THAT WHERE THAT'S APPROPRIATE. WHAT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFICS BY CAMPUS BY BY BUILDING BY PROJECT? YOU KNOW THAT WE SEE ABOUT FOUR BILL TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT TERRY IN PEACE WE DON'T WANNA ON THE CAMPUS WITH THE MOST BIGGEST LIST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. BENEFIT WONDERS OF THIS KIND OF A RESOURCE AVAILABLE -- AND SO -- WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE DATA. YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES WHEN WE START TALKING IN BIG NUMBERS HERE USE OR ABUSE HARD TO REALIZE BUT I'D. LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ARE SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THIS YEAR'S YOU WOULD BE EQUAL TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOOTBALL FIELDS. AND SO IF YOU JUST WANT CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IMAGINE EMILY IT THAT'S A LOT OF SPACE IT NEEDS SEISMIC UPGRADES AND H. FACT WATER MEAN ALL THE BASIC STUFF IT'S NOT PUTTING IN. GOLD WALLS AND FANCY CARPET IS DOING THE BASIC STUFF SO WE'LL GET TO THE LIST NONCHALANTLY I THINK. HEY I APPRECIATE THE EGALITARIAN SENSE OF THAT BUT I ALSO -- ONE INSURE THAT YOU'RE PRIORITIZING AGAIN Q. U. S. CAMPUSES THAT OPENED AT DIFFERENT DATES SOME ARE OLDER THAN OTHERS. IT OBVIOUSLY SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NOT FOR ANY FAULT OF A PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS JUST THEIR OLDER. SO -- HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOME SENSE OF PRIORITIZING BY WE HAVE A WE HAVE A GROUP HERE THAT CREATES A VERY SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS A LOOKS AT AGE. LOOKS AT USE CAPACITY LOOKS A WEAR AND TEAR. SOME OF THE BUILDINGS ARE ALL THAT OLD ON THE CALENDAR BUT ARE WORN OUT. IN OTHER CAMPUSES OF SAN MARCOS HAS A LOT OF NEW BUILDINGS AND SO THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH FOR THEIR BUILDINGS WERE BUILT IN LAST FOR THREE TO FIVE TEN YEARS SO. YOU KNOW. WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE GREAT. AND THEN I THINK IN THE IN REGARDS TO THE JEWS JUSTICE. FOLLOW UP TO MARK MY CALLING MY PREVIOUS CALLING THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION THAT'S ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IF THAT WERE APPROPRIATED TO GET A LIST OF WHERE. WHERE YOU WOULD -- BE SPENDING THAT. WE CAN PRODUCE THAT RIGHT AWAY TO HAVE A GREAT. ARMED. AND I THINK -- CHANCELLOR AND IMPRISONED POLIDORO -- MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO KIND OF REITERATED OUR CONCERN AROUND A NON RESIDENT ROLE NOT REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK YOUR YOUR YOUR SOLUTION THINGS VERY ARTFUL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND I THINK -- WE WE APPRECIATE -- IN A SENSE THAT WE YOU KNOW WE ARE REALLY WANTING TO ENSURE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS CONTINUE TO REMAIN A PRIORITY. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND AS IF YOU WOULD MENTION THAT ADMISSIONS YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA IF IF YOU CAN HIT A TARGET IT'S VERY HARD TO BE VERY PRECISE YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE UNDER OVER YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ON IT. THIS OF THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS -- OCCUR BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IN THE HOPE. IS THAT WE REALLY -- CONTINUE TO SEE AGAIN ALL THE CAMPUS IS HAVING A FOCUS ON ON THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THEY'RE REALLY TRYING. TO MANAGE THE OUT OF STATE IN ROME I KNOW THAT EVERY CHANCELLOR. REALLY LIKES THE FREEDOM OF THE OUT OF STATE. TUITION BUT IT ALSO -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT COMES AT A COST IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US. TO CONTINUE TO SEE SUCH HIGH OUT OF STATE AND ROMAN WHEN -- IN WHEN THEY'RE WHEN WE CONTINUE TO TRY. TO INCREASE OUR FUNDING REQUEST BUT THE SAME TIME TO BE ENOUGH SPOTS FOR IN OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OUR OUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. I'M SO TO KIND OF JUST ALONG THE LINE SAY THE SAME THING THAT I HAVE STRESS TENSOR WHY WAS JUST TO GET A LIST OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- ITEMS THAT ARE BEING SPENT ON FOR FOR THIS CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR. ARE FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND THEN ALSO THE LIST FOR THEM FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION THAT YOU WOULD WOULD YOU WOULD WANT TO SPEND I MEAN I KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S YEAH GIVE A MUCH LARGER LESS THAN THAT -- BUT IT WOULD JUST BE GOOD TO IF YOU GOT THAT APPROPRIATION WHERE WHERE IT WOULD GO AND TO TO WHAT IT WOULD BE. FOR WILL GET THAT TO YOU -- BEFORE I THINK THE NEXT HEARING IS MARCH NINETEENTH THERE'S SO WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT IN HAND BY THEM THAT THAT BE GREAT I THINK. I THINK I'VE I'VE MENTIONED THIS TO EACH OF THE THREE OF YOU SEPARATELY I KNOW THAT. AGAIN THIS ISSUE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE EACH TALK TO ME ABOUT FOR PROBABLY THE LAST THREE YEARS AND I THINK WE'LL BE. TALKING ABOUT -- FOR AS LONG AS I'M AROUND AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU KNOW FROM -- THE STATE BUDGET POINT GREAT FOR THE SYSTEMS TO KIND OF COME TOGETHER AND I KNOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAM. BUT TO AT LEAST COME TOGETHER SO WE HAVE A HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT. THE THE NEED IS AND HOW BIG IN THE EIGHTIES AND AND SORT OF WHERE THE NEED IS I KNOW THAT THERE'S THOUGHT THAT YOU MAY GO -- FORWARD WITH THE BOND AND AND AND TRY TO RAISE MONEY THAT WAY WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY SMART AND MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO GETTING YOUR TRIP TO REALLY HIGH THINK HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE -- ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR I THINK VERY SMARTLY -- AND WE AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH IS HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ONE TIME FUNDING. AND THIS IS I THINK A VERY GOOD -- VERY GOOD APPROPRIATIONS FOR ONE TIME FINDINGS I THINK THIS THIS YEAR IS A GOOD YEAR. TO HAVE THAT [inaudible] DISCUSSION INDEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND WE'LL SEE YEARS SEGMENTS BACK IN THE COMING WEEKS THEY'RE GOOD THANK YOU SIR WITH THAT WE WILL PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. LINED UP OVER HERE. ON THE SIDE MAMA [inaudible] SO. THE JOYS OF CHAIRMAN YEAH [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] PLEASE BEGIN. HELLO PROFESSOR HOW ARE YOU SIR HOW MANY HAVE YOU LEAD OFF LEAD BY EXAMPLE. FOR EVERYBODY QUIET DOWN THE ROOM PLEASE CHANCELLOR PRESIDENT. IN THE CASE OF OUR AREA. THANK YOU PROJECTS YES PROFESSOR YOU CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS EVERYBODY CAN FOLLOW YOUR LEAD THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MCCARTY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS SEASONAL CANTON I'M THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT -- FOR FRONT OF ACTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY SENSATION THE FACULTY MEMBER AT CAL STATE SACRAMENTO. SEE THE CALIFORNIA FACT ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THE OVERALL FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE CSU HOWEVER WE REQUEST THAT THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO BE SET ASIDE TO HIRE NEW FOR TENURE TRACK FACULTY IN THE CSU. THIS MONEY WOULD RESULT RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY THREE REQUIRE THE CSU TO PROVIDE AN ALLOCATION PLAN BY OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE PROVIDED COMMITTEE STAFF WITH BUDGET LANGUAGE FOR THIS REQUEST. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FULL TIME TENURE TRACK PROFESSORS HARMS THE STUDENTS WHO RELY ON CSU FOR QUALITY PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. TURNOVER AMONG LECTURE AFFECT THESE HIGH IF THEY MUST NATURALLY SEARCH FOR LONG TERM STABLE TEACHING POSITIONS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED TWENTY FIVE MILLION THE HIVE TENURE TRACK FACULTY FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED NEW FACULTY SYSTEM WIDE. THIS WAS A GREAT STEP FORWARD BUT NOT ENOUGH THE REQUEST FOR THIRTY FIVE MILLION REFLECTS A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE BASED ON LAST YEAR'S NEW ONGOING FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU FIFTY NINE SECONDS. I'LL TRY AND MATCH THAT -- ENTER HEARD SOFT DEPARTMENT POLITICAL SCIENCE AT SACRAMENTO STATE ALSO WITH THE CFA TODAY ONE OF OUR OTHER REQUESTS IS THAT WHILE WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE OVERALL FUNDING LEVELS AND I DON'T THINK WE SAID THAT IN. THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE -- THE CFA REQUEST THE TWENTY MILLION BE SET ASIDE IN OCTOBER FOR MENTAL HEALTH SPECIFICALLY TO REACH A RATIO OF ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT COUNSELOR FOR EVERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. ON ALL THE CAMPUSES EIGHTEEN MILLION TO GO TO THOSE COUNSELORS TWO MILLION FOR A PORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING QUESTIONS OF SUCH AS HOW MANY SUICIDES FOR CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH SURVEYS -- THERE'S BEEN A GROWING CRISIS THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF RATIOS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELING SERVICES WHILE THERE IS A SET ASIDE IN THE UC'S BUDGET THE CSU HAS NOT ELSE FOR THIS WE THINK THAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE THERE. CERTAINLY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL SUGGESTED THE HEALTH OF OUR OVERALL STUDENTS IS IMPORTANT IT'S A QUESTION WITH STUDENT SUCCESS I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THERE WERE FIVE SUICIDES STAFF COUNSELORS AND ALL. THEY CAN AND WHERE WE LOOK INTO THAT WITH THAT MENTAL HEALTH ACT PROP SIXTY THREE SO THANK YOU. I AM HERE ARE REPRESENTING JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE RECEIVING FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL TO INVEST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN ADDRESSING STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. IN TODAY'S ECONOMY WE KNOW THE POST SECONDARY CREDENTIAL IS ESSENTIAL AND YET YOU DISPARITIES REMAIN AND WHO HAS ACCESS TO A COLLEGE DEGREE. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DISPARITIES FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS HAVING A CRISIS IN HOMELESSNESS AMONG ITS COLLEGE STUDENTS. CLOSE 220% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND THE SAME IS TRUE 411% OF CSU STUDENTS. DESPITE THIS REALITY CALIFORNIA LACKS ANY TARGETED INTERVENTION TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND INVESTMENT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ENABLE THE THREE POST SECONDARY SYSTEMS TO PARTNER WITH HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO QUICKLY MOVE STUDENTS INTO HOUSING DESIGNED TO SUPPORT COLLEGE RETENTION COLLEGES WOULD ALSO BE SUPPORTED TO ESTABLISH REFERRAL PATHWAYS TO LOCAL HOUSING RESOURCES. AND ENSURE THAT HOMELESS STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING ALL POSSIBLE FINANCIAL AID I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BUDGET REQUEST THANK YOU. RASHEEDA CRUTCHFIELD ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH AND A PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE CSU STUDY. ON BASIC NEEDS EXPLORING FOOD SECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR STUDENTS. AS MENTIONED 11% OF OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND THIS IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING A NUMBER OF OUR STUDENT GROUPS -- MOST STARTLING 18% FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. IN COLLECTING DATA ACROSS THE STATE I'VE SPOKEN TO SO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS ARE LIVING IN TENTS. ARE LIVING IN FARMS ARE LIVING IN STE MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE HAVING VERY DRAMATIC NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. A SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT REALLY IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN HOUSING. AND HIGHER EDUCATION INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE PERSISTING IN ORDER TO DO WHAT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO. TO REACH ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY. BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS I'LL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS I'VE BEEN MEETING WITH MISTER MARTIN SEVERAL TIMES BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA -- PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS FUNDING AS WELL AS A FULL TIME -- HIGHER FACULTY HIRING OF FUNDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR -- MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO KERN PERALTA IN SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- BASICALLY COLA GROWTH AN EXTENSION OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM WE SUPPORT THOSE -- AND RECOGNIZE THE LIMITS ON PROP NINETY EIGHT THIS YEAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS.

THE RELIANCE ON STUDENT TUITION FOR FUNDING IS A DETERRENT REGARDLESS OF RESIDENCY FOCUSING ON GRADUATION RATES IS NECESSARY BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF STUDENTS TO THEIR GRADUATION PATH. WHETHER IT'S CONSULATE GOING TO LECTURE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH NOT HAVING PERMANENT HOUSING WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH ACADEMICALLY ASSOCIATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE NEED TO SUPPORT OF STATE WHICH NECESSARY.

THIRTY THOUSAND ACADEMIC EMPLOYEES AT YOU SEE IN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IT'S THE ISSUE. I COME HERE FOR TWO THINGS ONE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S INCREASES WERE HIGHER AND FUNDING BUT ALSO TO FLAG FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON SPENDING DECISIONS ESPECIALLY BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AT THE UC. IN SEPTEMBER A SUPER MAJORITY OF WORKERS STUDYING AUTHORIZATION CARDS -- OF ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS TO FORM A NEW UNION. SINCE THEN THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT HAS APPROVED OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL THAT HAS BEEN DENYING AND DELAYING THEIR DEMOCRATIC CHOICE TO FORM A UNION. AND SINCE THEN -- THEY'VE NOT RECOGNIZE THE UNIT OR SIT DOWN AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WE DEFINITELY SUPPORTS -- HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE USED THERE COULD BE MANY OTHER BETTER USES LIKE SUPPORT STUDENTS AND NOT TO DO NINE DELAY THE DEMOCRATIC CHOICE BY WORKERS THANKS. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS KAREN SONG AND I'M A SOPHOMORE AT UC BERKELEY. I CURRENTLY WORK WITH THE ACC MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN PRE HEALTH COMMUNITY I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND FROM FRIENDS AND OTHER PEERS THE INACCESSIBILITY OF UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES. THIS CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE LACK OF RESOURCES MEN'S AND LONG WAIT TIMES. AS A RESULT MANY STUDENTS INCLUDING SEVERAL FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE TAKEN A LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ADDRESS THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. FOR THAT REASON IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE STATE TO INVESTING KEY SERVICES LIKE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THAT WILL PRIORITIZE A STUDENTS WELL BEING AND FOSTER ACADEMIC SUCCESS. I ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO FULLY FUND THE UC SO THAT SERVICES LIKE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND OTHER VARIOUS RESOURCES WILL BE GUARANTEED FOR STUDENTS THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS NEIL MCCLINTIC I'M A TRANSFER STUDENT UC BERKELEY AND SET TO GRADUATE IN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS -- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE COMMITTEE TO NOT LOOK AT THEIR PHONES WHILE IN SPEAKING -- I'VE BEEN HERE MANY MANY HOURS TRAVEL HOURS TO GET HERE AND IT'S PRETTY RUDE TO US -- LIKE I SAID I'M SET TO GRADUATE BUT I'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR THREE YEARS FIRST THEY CAME IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT NOW I'M COMING AS A UC STUDENT. SPENDING ON HIGHER EDUCATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT PUMPING OUT DEGREES FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER AND IT'S FRANKLY VERY FRUSTRATING TO HEAR THAT KIND OF RHETORIC AROUND HERE. WHEN IT'S REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY IS THRIVING HAVING A GREAT TIME AND THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE? OVER HERE WE HAD THE WE HAD THE SORRY -- EARLIER I HEARD RHETORIC ABOUT HOW -- I HEARD RHETORIC ABOUT HOW IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS WHO. ARE WEALTHY AND WHO ARE NOT WALTHY BUT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT IT'S NOT THE SITUATION ACTUALLY IS ON THE GROUND. NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ARE PAYING FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TUITION ONE NOT PROTECTED FROM RETURNED AID JUST BECAUSE OF AN AVERSION TO STUDENTS WHO WERE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO LIVE HERE. BASIN RHETORIC THAT IS NEARLY TRUMP IAN AND ITS HATRED PRADA STATE STUDENTS AND I SAY THIS IS AN IN STATE STUDENT. PLEASE STOP PLAYING HOPPER TAITO DEFERRING THIS EXISTENTIAL CRISIS TO USE YOUR P. OR THE REGION'S. THE LEGISLATURE WILL DEFLECT BY BLAMING YOU SEE A P. ON BAD FINANCES ALL THE WHILE YOU SEE IS NOW ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. CUTTING BUDGETS FLASHING ADMINISTRATION. THE UC TOOK A BILLION DOLLAR BLOW DURING THE RECESSION IS AND IS RECEIVING JUST 51% OF IT USED TO PER STUDENT DO NOT RELY ON TO SCREEN OVER NON RESIDENT STUDENTS BECAUSE THIS INCLUDE NON WEALTHY OUT OF STATE. AND NINE EIGHTY FIVE FORTY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AS WELL AND ALSO POTENTIAL CAP OF 10% ON NON RESIDENT STUDENTS MEANS THAT ALL STUDENTS WILL JUST HAVE TO PAY MORE TO MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE. SO IT'S BAD POLICY THANK YOU THE WAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. SURE BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE WHO CAME HERE AND TOOK HOURS. THE SAID HERE THANK YOU OKAY. GOOD EVENING ALEX GRAVES WITH THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING EIGHTY THREE OF THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- THERE WAS SOME CONVERSATION TODAY AROUND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAL GRANT DOLLARS TO STUDENT PARENTS -- COLLECTIVELY OUR INSTITUTION RULES ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED CAL GRANT STUDENT PARENTS AND SHOULD THAT PROPOSAL MOVE FORWARD -- WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE -- TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT PARENTS ATTENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THAT SUPPLEMENTAL AID -- UNDER THE PROPOSAL THEY ARE NOT -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDENTS SHOULD BE TREATED EQUITABLY AND THAT THEY FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS ATTENDING OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THANKS. HELLO MY NAME IS LEE SAID DORIS I AM A THIRTY YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED. I'M ALSO AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT -- I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST THING THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IS THE A BIG NOREEN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS NOT AB FIVE FORTY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN THE RHETORIC OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS -- IT'S MORE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS THEN UNDOCUMENTED NON AB FIVE FORTY QUALIFYING STUDENTS. AND SO WITH THE TUITION INCREASE AT TARGETS LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR AB. FIVE FORTY I DON'T THINK THAT PAYING NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS EXTRA A YEAR -- IS MUCH TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN ON WEALTHIER FAMILIES AND IT IS TO A LOWER INCOME UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY YOU MENTIONED THAT A 5% TUITION INCREASE WOULD BE BEST BUT WITH LAST YEAR'S TWO POINT 5% INCREASE IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED TWO POINT SIX INCREASE THAT'S ALREADY A 5% INCREASE WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS -- I WILL FIRSTHAND LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT A DEGREE DOES NOT EQUATE A BETTER LIFE IF I HOPE THAT YOU DEFINE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE. AS A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT UNIVERSITY IS MEANT TO TRULY OFFER ME. MY TUITION INCREASES THE TRADE OFF OF IN STATE TUITION REMAINING FLAT -- I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR NON RESIDENTS TO STUDENT TUITION INCREASE THIS PRE ACT PREVIOUS ACADEMIC YEAR BY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE QUAKE EQUITY GAP EXTENT EXTENDS TO MORE THAN THE SYMBOLISM OF A DEGREE -- LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE AFTER THE DEGREES ATTAIN MORE SO THAN JUST THE ATTAINING OF A DEGREE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE YOU NON RESIDENT STUDENTS I'M UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT AND WE FALL UNDER THE NON RESIDENT TUITION FEE -- I WON I QUALIFY FOR AB FIVE FORTY IT'S WAIVED YES BUT DON'T YOU QUALIFY FOR THE AB FIVE FORTY AND AND AND EXCLUDE NON RESIDENT. YES BUT IF I WAS TO NOT QUALIFY FOR AB FIVE FORTY I WOULD STILL BE CHARGED THAT BUT AMONG THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS A LOT OF US DO FALL UNDER THAT. AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE BE HERE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS SARAH TO SHINE I'M A STUDENT UC BERKELEY AND I ALSO SERVICE THE FUN THE UC CHAIR FOR THE UC SINICIZATION -- WHILE I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND HOW HAPPY OR FOR A NEW FOCUS ON BASIC NEED SECURITY MENTAL HEALTH. AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES I REALLY NEED TO TAKE THIS TIME TO RE CENTER ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ONCE AGAIN WHO HAVE TIME AND TIME AGAIN BEEN A RACE FROM THE UC STERN NARRATIVE -- THE UC STERN ASSOCIATION IS UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSED TO PLACING A CAP ON ON REGINALD ENROLLMENT AND WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO CONTINUING TO INCREASE THEIR TUITION. BOTH OF THESE MEASURES WILL DAMAGE THE UC STATUS AS A NATIONAL GLOBAL LEADER IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND HARM ALL YOU SEE STUDENTS INCLUDING CALIFORNIANS -- LUCY WAS CREATED IN THE NAME OF THAT AS A AS OPPOSED TO THE CAP ON ON RESIDENT YES BUT THERE IS A CAP. WELL WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE 10% CAP THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. I THINK THE LETTER TO SCOTT PASS AROUND WE HAVE A PRESS RELEASE THAT WAS RELEASED TODAY AS WELL -- BUT THE UC WAS CREATED IN THE NAME OF ACCESSIBILITY AFFORDABILITY -- BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE THAT WHEN WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FOLKS OUT OF THIS INSTITUTION JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING WITH AN ARBITRARY BORDER OR HAVING THE RIGHT KIND OF DOCUMENTATION -- I PERSONALLY YOU BARELY MADE THE CUT TO BE A RESIDENT STUDENT I GREW UP IN ENGLAND AND I COULD HAVE VERY EASILY BEEN ON RESIDENT STUDENT BUT I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH THAT MY PARENTS MOVED QUICKLY ENOUGH -- I REALLY JUST I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP BUILDING A WALL AROUND THE UC -- PLEASE RECONSIDER THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN NON RESIDENT ROMAN THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S ARIANNA TELEPHONE TEN I'M A SOPHOMORE EAT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY I'M HERE ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO FUND THE BUDGET ASK OF THE UC AND NOT TO FUNDED THROUGH OUT OF STATE TUITION INCREASES OR ENROLLMENT CAPS. IF THE STATE WANTS TO INCREASING CONTINUE WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH THERE MUST BE THE FUNDING TO OFFSET THE COST OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEISMICALLY UNFIT BUILDINGS AT UC BERKELEY. THIS PAST SEMESTER IN THE FALL WHEN I WAS IN ROLLING FOR CALL LOSSES. IN OFF THE WEIGHTLESS FOR ONLY ONE I STARTED CLASSES THREE WEEKLY AND WITH THE WORLD UNLESS UNITS AND I HAD INTENDED. THIS MADE MY SEMESTER MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TRUSTFUL THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THIS LACK OF SPACE INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ONLY MEANS CUTTING CLASSES BUT A LACK OF SPACE FOR IMPORTANT STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY SPECIFIC RESOURCE CENTER IS LIKE A LOT AND NEXT RESOURCE CENTER. SOMETHING THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE RETENTION OF UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS RATHER THAN JUST INCREASING THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WILL NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES. THE INCREASE FUNDING OF SOUP STUDET INITIATED OUTREACH PROGRAMS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO ME OUR OUR SEIZE ON THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED ME TO OUTREACH TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WHO WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE ATTENDED BERKELEY. THE NUMBERS STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO ACCEPTED MISSIONS TO BERKELEY'S LOW AND THANKS TO THE R. C.'S MOST OF THEIR WORK BEING ON PAID. DOT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS TO CHOOSE TO ATTEND THE UC. FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AGAIN I ASK THE COMMITTEE TO FULLY FUND THE UC SO THAT WE CAN SERVE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED AT THE UC'S. MAKE SURE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING ON TIME OUR FOOD SECURE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND ARE NOT JUST SURVIVING BUT THRIVING THANK YOU.
