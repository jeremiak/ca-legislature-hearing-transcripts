BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COVERING PROPOSALS AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE ADULT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS IS OUR SECOND HEARING OF THE YEAR ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S HEARING THAT WAS FOCUSED ON CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH. BEFORE WE BEGIN I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO READ SOME DIRECTIONS REGARDING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S HEARING TO HELP INSURE THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE HERE TODAY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FULL PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE DISCUSSION. TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE ON THE STATE CAPITOL IN HEARING ROOM ONE TWENTY SEVEN HOWEVER ALL OF THE PANELISTS ON THE AGENDA ARE APPEARING REMOTELY.

THERE WILL BE NO VOTES TAKEN IN TODAY'S HEARING AND FINALLY WE WILL ALSO ACCEPT WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENTS IN THE FEEDBACK WILL GO THROUGH THE SUB ONE EMAIL ACCOUNT. AND THE ADDRESS IS BUDGET SUB ONE ACT ASM DOT CA DOT GOV. I WILL BEGIN WITH SOME INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS. MENTAL ILLNESSES PRESENCE AMONG MANY OF US WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN IMPACTED FAMILY MEMBER A FRIEND OR EVEN OURSELVES. MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A CRIME AND YET MANY EXCUSE ME AND YET THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION IN THE STATE IS THE L. A. COUNTY JAIL. WE CANNOT ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS BUT WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY WHO END UP IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT'S TIME TO HAVE A PARADIGM SHIFT AND TO GET UPSTREAM BY FOCUSING ON PREVENTATIVE EFFORTS AND ADDRESS THE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PASS WITH THE BLIND DIED THOSE WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS. WE AS A STATE MUST HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO DELIVERING REAL RESULTS. WE WILL NEED PARTNERSHIPS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCES WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WITH OUR COUNTY CIVIC LOCAL AND STATE PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE. BUT ABOVE ALL WE WILL NEED TO FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE WHO WE SERVE. IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS A STRONG NEED TO RESPOND IN UNISON. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS DETERMINES TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL 50% DIDN'T SEE HEALTH CARE IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO WATCH A SYSTEM THAT CONSISTENTLY LEADS SO MANY DOWN. WE NEED A NEW PARADIGM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA VALUES AND DELIVERS REAL RESULTS. WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO BE SO SICK THE SICKEST OF THE SICK ON OUR STREETS IN OUR JAILS OR IN OUR HOSPITALS. WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER. CARE AND COMPASSION MUST BE THE CALIFORNIA WAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS AND CREATING A SPACE WHERE WE ALL FEEL SAFE TO DISCUSS SUCH WEIGHTY ISSUES. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH IS ON CRISIS RESPONSE AND NINE EIGHT EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION. FOR THOSE WHO ARE PANELISTS AND PRESENTERS PLEASE PRESENT IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOUR NAME APPEARS IN THE AGENDA WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THIS PANEL UNTIL AFTER ALL OF THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED. WE WILL HAVE A LEVIN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THE L. A. O. AND SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS. LET'S BEGIN WITH STEPHANIE WELCH DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES PLEASE BEGIN. AFTER AN HONORABLE CHAIR DR ROMULUS AND OTHER MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS INVITATION TODAY AND- ALSO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORDS AT THE TOP OF THIS MEETING I THINK YOU'RE REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THEY'RE- THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE REFLECTED IN MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY- MY NAME IS STEPHANIE WELCH ON THE DEPUTY SECRETARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND IN THAT CAPACITY I SERVED AS A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE SECRETARY GALLEY. AND OUR AGENCY TEAM ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. ANOTHER ROLE THAT I PLAY WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR CONVERSATION HERE TODAY ABOUT THE CRISIS CARE CONTINUE ON. IS TO SUPPORT OUR DEPARTMENTS AND FELLOW GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. IN COORDINATING AND LEVERAGING OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I WOULD LIKE TO START TODAY BY EXPRESSING MY APPRECIATION FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE. FOR PRIORITIZING INVESTMENTS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THAT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO CAL AIMED AT CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE. THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM BE AVAILABLE AS A BENEFIT IN MEDIC CAL. OUR NEW OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ENFORCEMENT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOCUSED INVESTIGATIONS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST IN FACT IT DOESN'T EVEN COVER SOME OF THIS YEAR'S CURRENT PROPOSALS. BUT IT IS A PRIVILEGE AFTER TWENTY PLUS YEARS IN THIS IN WORKING IN THE SPACE TO SERVE IN AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO BUILD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR DECADES AND I DON'T JUST MEAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE BUT I MEAN FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE. OUR LACK OF CAPACITY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY DECADES OF STIGMA WHERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FRANKLY WAS NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THE CORE HEALTH SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA IS CHANGING THIS THIS IS NOT THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE- IMPLEMENT HEALTH CARE ANYMORE. THERE'S A REASON WHY TAKE YOUR VALUABLE TIME TO MENTION THESE INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE ALL OF THE DETAILS THAT YOU'LL HEAR ON THIS PANEL TODAY AND ACTUALLY SEVERAL PANELS TODAY REGARDING CURRENT AND PLANNED ACTIVITIES IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA'S CRISIS CARE RESPONSE SYSTEM NEED TO BE COORDINATED. THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS MEANS THAT STATES OF EMERGENCY. WILL BECOME ENDEMIC NOT EPISODIC AND THAT CO THAT AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS ENDEMIC THESE CHALLENGES WILL INCREASE ECONOMIC INSTABILITY STRESS ANXIETY DEPRESSION ISOLATION AND SUBSTANCE USE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S PEOPLE. AND THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ALL OF THIS BEING SAID THERE ARE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHANGE E'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SEVERAL OF THEM TODAY- THERE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT HOTLINE. THERE ARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN MEDIC CAL AND FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITH THAT LEARNING EVERY DAY THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE TO REACH PEOPLE WITH OUR CAL HOPE PROGRAM. AND ABOVE ALL SOMETHING I BELIEVE DEEPLY AND IS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF PEER SUPPORT AND WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING IN CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT CRISIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BIDEN ANNOUNCED A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND IT'S AND IT'S PART OF HIS UNITY AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THE FEDERAL BUDGET. WILL PROPOSE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP ESTATE STAFF OF OUR CRISIS CALL CENTERS AND SHORE UP GAPS IN. OUR NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. SO YOU ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT ARE OUR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU I'M A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'LL BE DOING HERE AT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT- OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HERE. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME MORE THESE COMPONENTS IN SPECIFIC DETAIL. THIS IS A VERY DYNAMIC SPACE CERTAINLY IN MY CAREER I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THAT IS REALLY EXCITING. BUT WE WANTED TO BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND AS WE SAW ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES COMING OUR WAY QUITE QUICKLY FRANKLY WE FELT THAT. AT AGENCY WOULD BE WELL POSITIONED TO WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH OUR NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS OR STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES. TO PLAN FOR THIS WORK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF BOTH CURRENT AND PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO CRISIS. SO SPECIFICALLY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OFF OF EXISTING PLANNING EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY TO BUILD THE CAPACITY TO REACH THE VISION THAT WAS INTENDED BY THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT CREATED NINE EIGHT EIGHT. AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO LAUNCH INTO A PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A BLUEPRINT BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR SO IT IS GOING TO BE A SPRINT. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING ISSUES. WE WILL IDENTIFY A STATEWIDE VISION FOR A SET OF SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CRISIS. INCLUDING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND NINE ONE ONE. MEDI CAL MOBILECRISIS RESPONSE CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITIES AND LONG TERM CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES WE WILL ARTICULATE A STATEWIDE MINIMUM SET OF STANDARDS. AND IDENTIFY METRICS TO MEASURE THE STANDARDS. WE WILL IDENTIFY MODELS MORE SPECIFICALLY PROTOTYPES OF HOW STATEWIDE SERVICES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY I THINK THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S ALSO COMPLICATED BUT- SOMETHING THAT I FEEL THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. PARTICULARLY WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WILL BE SPEAKING LATER ON THIS PANEL WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT MODELS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT SAID IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T HAVE A BASIC STATE WIDE STANDARD- AND THEN WE CAN WORK TO GET THERE OVER TIME. WE ALSO WILL PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE RESOURCES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED AND OR HOW WE COULD USE OUR CURRENT AND PROPOSED INVESTMENTS. TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST CRISIS CARE RESPONSE SYSTEM. WE WILL OUTLINE A GOVERNANCE MODEL TO SUPPORT FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT AGENCY WE HAVE TWELVE DEPARTMENTS FIVE OFFICES. WE LIAISON WITH CALLAWAY YES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEIR ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY IS AND HAVING A ROBUST CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. WILL IDENTIFY. AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY. WE WILL IDENTIFY MAJOR MILESTONES IT'S BASICALLY THE HOW TO AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE- WE ARE. IT'LL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ALIGN OUR OVER ARCHING INVESTMENTS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH OUR OVER OUR OVER ARCHING GOALS TO HAVE A ROBUST CRISIS CARE SYSTEM. THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ABOVE ALL THIS BLUEPRINT WILL BE COKE CO CREATED WITH OUR KEY STAKEHOLDERS MANY OF THEM ALREADY BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS. SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE LAST YEAR AND PREPARING FOR THIS AND I THINK IT'S- IMPERATIVE THAT THEY BE INVOLVED NOT ONLY ARE STAKEHOLDERS BUT REALLY OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND OF COURSE CONSUMERS CAREGIVERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE IMPACTED BY A SYSTEM THAT EITHER WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK. AND WE NEED THEIR USER EXPERIENCE TO HELP US MAKE SOMETHING THAT WORKS BETTER- IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF INTERNAL INFORMATION GATHERING AND ARE REALLY EXCITED TO LAUNCH INTO THIS PROCESS THIS SPRING AND ARE VERY PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE SOON AND OFTEN. IN THIS PROCESS. SHARES OF WE WERE ALSO ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THE GOVERNOR ON THURSDAY. RELATED TO THE CARE COURT INITIATIVE FRAMEWORK. TODAY HE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I' GOING TO REALLY GET SOME VERY HIGH VERY HIGH LEVEL HIGHLIGHTS- YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS AGENDAS AGENDA AHEAD OF YOU AND I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF TIME- AND WELCOME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THIS IN MORE DETAIL. SO THE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE RECOVERY AND EMPOWERMENT OR CARE COURT. IS A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK I THINK THE TERM FRAMEWORK IS INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE. BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION DEEPLY WANTS TO DEVELOP THIS FURTHER WITH THE EXPERTISE AND INSIGHTS OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ADVOCATES. AND THE WORK THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SPACE FOR SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS- AGENCY WE ARE DEDICATED TO SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS. IN THE COMING WEEKS TO BUILD OUT THE FRAMEWORK INTO A SET OF POLICY SOLUTIONS MANY OF WHICH HAVE DELIBERATED ON. IN THIS. PARTICULAR BODY I KNOW YOU GUYS HAD A VERY LARGE HEARING IN THE IN THE LATE FALL AND EARLY WINTER. ON THIS VERY TOPIC IN REALLY DELVED INTO A LOT OF SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE ARE WARRANTED TO. LIFT UP AND TO RECOGNIZE AND TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. LET ME TELL YOU A THING IF YOU THINGS ABOUT I THINK AIRPORT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS TRYING TO DEAL FIRST SIMILAR AND REALLY RESONATING WITH THE WORDS THAT YOU WOULD SHARE IT AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA HERE IT IS A PARODY AND SHIPPED. THIS IS ABOUT GOING UPSTREAM TO DIVERT AND PREVENT RESPONSES THAT RESULT INSTITUTIONALIZATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THE DEEPEST OF CONDITIONS. THIS WILL PREVENT AND AIMS TO PREVENT CONSERVATORSHIP AND UNFORTUNATELY INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS THESE OUTCOMES CAN BE ELIMINATED FOR MANY PEOPLE. CARE COURT IS ALSO A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SYSTEMS LIKE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CIVIL COURT SOCIAL WELFARE. AND ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS WORKING TOGETHER IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES TO COORDINATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES HOUSING AND OTHER SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REACH THAT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST SEVERELY IMPAIRED AND ARE UNDER OR UNTREATED- SO OFTEN LANGUISH. SUFFERING IN HOMELESSNESS OR INCARCERATION WITHOUT THE TREATMENT THAT THEY DESERVE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY REPORT IS ABOUT PEOPLE. FIRST SUPPORTING A PATH TO RECOVERY AND SELF DETERMINATION IS CORE TO CARE FOR WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ANY NEW SUPPORTER FOR EACH PARTICIPANT IN ADDITION TO THEIR FULL CLINICAL TEAM THE ROLE OF THE SUPPORTER IS TO HELP THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERSTAND CONSIDER AND COMMUNICATE THEIR OWN DECISION GIVING THE PARTICIPANT TOOLS TO MAKE SELF DIRECTED CHOICES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. THE SUPPORTER WILL ALSO HELP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE CARE DIRECTIVE AND FOR FUTURE EPISODES AND FOR A GRADUATION PLAN TO SUPPORT LONG TERM RECOVERY AND WELLNESS POST CARE COURT. SUPPORTERS ARE TRAINED IN SUPPORT OF DECISION MAKING AND WILL REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE EXPERIENCES. AND SECOND. SUPPORTING SYSTEMS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. TO DELIVER ROBUST SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DESIGNED SO FAR IN THIS SPACE ONLY FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY ARE YOU AS THE CLIENT OR PATIENT. PARTICIPATING IN TREATMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR CELLS. ARE TO US THE PROVIDERS WHO NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE DEEPEST END OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON. AND FRANKLY MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN IGNORED. SPECIFICALLY CARE COURT CONNECTS A PERSON IN CRISIS. WITH THE APP CONNECTS A PERSON IN CRISIS WITH THE SPECIFIC PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION THAT THEY MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO MEET THE CRITERIA FOR CARE COVERAGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT PARTICULAR CRITERIA IS SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING WITH THE SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM OR OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. THEY ARE CONNECTED TO CARE AND THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE CARE COURT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A CLINICAL ASSESSMENT. AND TO EVENTUALLY RECEIVE A CARE COURT- COURT ORDERED PLAN FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXTENSION OF AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS. REFERRALS IN THE QUEUE CARE ACT TO CARE COURT WILL WILL DIFFER BUT ONE EXAMPLE COULD BE THAT. IT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS EXITING A SHORT TERM INVOLUNTARY HOSPITAL HOLD. OF BECAUSE THEYWERE BELIEVED TO BE ARE FOUND TO BE EXCUSE ME GRAVELY DISABLED AND OR HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS TO SOMEBODY'S EXENE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR FIFTY TO FIFTY WHICH IS A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD. THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE PROVIDED THUS FAR IS REALLY FOCUSING ON PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS WITH CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED CARE. THIS IS IMPORTANT THIS IS NOT CARE ENOUGH IN A HOSPITAL IN A LOCK SETTING THIS IS INTENDED TO BE COMMUNITY BASED CARE. THAT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT AND IT CONTAINS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND IF NEEDED AND NECESSARY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS SERVICES STABILISATION MEDICATION WELLNESS AND RECOVERY SUPPORT AND CONNECTIONS TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND THAT INCLUDES A COURT ORDERED. HOUSING PLANS ARE I'M SORRY THAT THAT INCLUDES A HOUSING PLAN AS PART OF THE COURT ORDERED TREATMENT. THE HOUSING PLAN IS IMPORTANT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FINDING STABILITY AND STAYING CONNECTED TO TREATMENT WITHOUT THE PROPER- EVEN WITH THE PROPER SUPPORTS FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP FOR EGG SANDRA. IS REALLY NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU'RE LIVING OUTDOORS IN A TENT OR IN A VEHICLE.AND I'M GOING TO END WITH REALLY EMPHASIZING ONE IMPORTANT PORT ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND IT THIS IS ALSO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ME. CANACCORD IS NOT FOR EVERYONE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR MENTAL ILLNESS. IT IS VERY FOCUSED ON A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS OR OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS WHO LACK MEDICAL DECISION MAKING CAPACITY BOTH FOR. AND THAT'S THE GOAL BEFORE THEY GET ARRESTED BEFORE THEY GET COMMITTED TO A STATE HOSPITAL OR BEFORE THEY BECOME SO I'M SO IMPAIRED THAT THEY END UP IN A LPS MENTAL HEALTH CONSERVATORSHIP. HOMELESSNESS HAS MANY MANY FACES IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK ALL OF US COULD AGREE I OR AT LEAST MANY OF US AGREE. THAT AMONG THE MOST TRAGIC IS THE FACE OF THE OF THE VERY SICKEST WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM FRANKLY VERY VERY TREATABLE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO CONNECT THESE INDIVIDUALS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND SUPPORT AND HELP THEM BE EMPOWERED TO MAP THEIR OWN PATH TO LONG TERM RECOVERY. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I CHAIR I THINK WE HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE PANEL OR KEY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM G. C. COOPER WHO IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC OUR POPULATION. THE TRAUMA FROM ISOLATION ILLNESS GRIEF AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY HAS AFFECTED THE MENTAL WELL BEING OF YOUTH AND ADULTS. ALMOST HALF OF THE YOUTH AND ADULTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY. OF DEPRESSION. IN THE NEED FOR PRE CLINICAL SERVICES INCLUDING PEER WARM LINES WEB RESOURCES TAX THE CHAT SUPPORT AND SELF HELP AS WELL AS CLINICAL SERVICES. FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS ARE PRESENTING IN CRISIS THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN A CUTIE SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS IN INCREASES IN DEATH BY SUICIDE FOR PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AH YES LAUNCH SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE GROWING ACUITY OF NEED SERVICES FOR THE BROAD POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO NEED SUPPORT WHEN STRESSED SO THEY DON'T DEVELOP A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE IN CRISIS TO PREVENT THE NEED TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM OR GET INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE ACS IS LEVERAGING THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND CAL AIMS TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MAKING IT EASIER TO GET CARE RELIEVING UNNECESSARY DOCUMENTATION BURDENS THAT KEEP PROVIDERS FROM PATIENT CARE. INCREASING ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OVER THE CARE CONTINUUM. THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO RAMPING UP NETWORK ADEQUACY IN CONTRACT EXPECTATIONS TO ENSURE EACH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN DELIVERS WHAT IS NEEDED. HE IS THIS IS ALSO PROCESSING ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ADDING NEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH MANY NEW INITIATIVES INCLUDING DYADIC CARE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IN THE NEW SERVICES IN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. FINALLY THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR A ROBUST SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CRISIS. WE ARE PROPOSING A NEW BEEFIT IN MEDIC HOW. MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES I WHICH KELLY WILL REVIEW IN A MOMENT. WE ARE INVESTING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WITH PLANNING GRANTS IN IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXPANDED FACILITIES THE PEOPLE IN CRISIS HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO GO IN TO GET THE NEEDED AIR.

THANK NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM I RE HAVE WHO IS A- PEER SUPPORT. AT DAY. PLEASE BEGIN. HELLO I'M MY NAME IS THREE HACK- I A YOU'RE SO FOR. AT THE C. D. EARLY SO PROGRAM. I WAS ASKED TO TESTIFY TODAY TO TALK ABOUT MY LIVED EXPERIENCE IS A CONSUMER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN MY EXPERIENCE ACCESSING CRISIS RESOURCES. I'M I HAVE THE BASE VARIANT OF A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER AND HAVING PSYCHOTIC BREAK WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN AM POLICE RESPONDED TO MY HOME. I'M TWICE AND NEITHER TIMES DID I RECEIVE ANY USEFUL SERVICES OR WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED- ON BOTH OCCASIONS AND THE POLICE RESPONDED TO ASK VERY FEW QUESTIONS AND LAUGHED WHEN I SAID. I WAS FINE AND THE OUTCOME OF THAT WAS I WAS PSYCHOTIC FOR MUCH LONGER THAN I NEEDED TO EAT AND THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LONGER SOMEONE IS PSYCHOTIC WITHOUT TREATMENT THE WORSE YOUR OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE. I'M AND I WAS EVENTUALLY HOSPITALIZED BUT WE HAVE CALLED THE POLICE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT HAPPENED I'M AND WHEN PEOPLE CALL THE POLICE FOR A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS. YOU ARE HOSPITALIZED OR NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS I THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THE TWO OUTCOMES WHEN THE POLICE RESPOND TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS- THEY DO NOTHING OR- YOU YOU GET HOSPITALIZED- SO ARE YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN RESPONDNG TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES- I BELIEVE THAT TRAIN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. BOTH WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE- SHOULD BE RESPONDING TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES- AND I ALSO DON'T FEEL LIKE AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE A NINE EIGHT EIGHT LINE SURE THAT HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE OTHER THAN INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION OR NOTHING THERE ARE A LOT OF SERVICES LIKE- OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAMS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. AND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS SO COMPLEX I WORK WITH SO MANY FAMILIES- AND- PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE MENTAL HALTH. SYSTEM THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SERVICES. ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO WE HAD AT THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT LINE ABLE TO PROVIDE REFERRALS SHE- SERVICES BACK FAMILIES AND CLIENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AND WOULD REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND WOULD REDUCE. AB YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE GO WITHOUT TREATMENT WHICH IS VERY DRAMATIC IT'S VERY TRAUMATIC TO BE PSYCHOTIC OR HOW YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FOR LONGER THAN YOU NEED TO GO- AND I ALSO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT. A NINE EIGHT SERVICE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS- THANK YOU THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS FOR TODAY HEAR FROM JOHN FRANKLIN SIERRA SENIOR STAFF ANALYSTS AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY- CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU HELLO EVERYONE HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M JOHN FRANKLIN ZERO WITH THE L. A. COUNTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE. FROM THE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION INITIATIVE I'M A HEALTH SYSTEMS ENGINEER- AND I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE COUNTIES ALTERNATIVE CRISIS RESPONSE PROGRAM WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CEO. AND THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. WE'RE WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE BOTH THE CAPACITY AND THE COORDINATION OF OUR CRISIS CARE SERVICES COUNTY WIDE IN PREPARATION FOR THE OFFICIAL ROLL OUT OF NINETY EIGHT THIS JULY. WE ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE ALL INDIVIDUALS IN L. A. COUNTY WHO EXPERIENCE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS OR EMERGENCY. HAVE ACCESS TO RAPID RELIABLE AND PROFESSIONAL CARE WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT UNLESS NECESSARY. JUST AS OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD EXPECT FOR ANY OTHER HEALTH EMERGENCY. FURTHERMORE WE KNOW THAT GAPS IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. LIKE TO BUY AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS FROM THESE COMMUNITIES ENDING UP IN OUR JAILS ON THE STREET AND REPEATEDLY HOSPITALIZED. WE MUST BUILD A CRISIS SYSTEM WHICH ADDRESSES THESE INEQUITIES HEAD ON. AND SO WE INTEND TO LEVERAGE NINE EIGHT EIGHT AS THE PREFERRED NO WRONG DOOR AND CENTRAL POINT OF ACCESS FOR CRISIS CARE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE SYSTEM WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD AN L. A. COUNTY IS AMBITIOUS IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO RECHARGE VISION. AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE ONE TIME FUNDS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE TO SUPPORT THIS EXPANSION. INCLUDING THE STATE'S CRISIS CARE MOBILE UNITS GRANT FROM THE BEACH THAT PROGRAM WHICH WILL PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO OUR MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE. HOWEVER WE STILL NEED TO IDENTIFY AND SECURE ON GOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED CRISIS SERVICES CAPACITY THAT WE NEED SYSTEM WIDE. AS WELL AS TO BETTER SUPPORT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. THAT WILL ENSURE IT OPERATES AS A COHESIVE WHOLE. AND WE KNOW THAT WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE TO ACTUALLY DELIVER ON THIS VISION FOR OUR CRISIS SYSTEM A PROBLEM THAT FUNDING ALONE CANNOT OVERCOME. BUT STILL TO REALIZE THIS VISION IN YEARS INSTEAD OF DECADES DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DO TODAY. IT REQUIRES AN URGENCY OF ACTION COMMENSURATE WITH THE URGENCY OF THE NEED. SOMETHING OUR COMMUNITIES REMIND US CONSTANTLY AS THEY BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CURRENT SYSTEMS FAILURES. HERE IN L. A. COUNTY WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUR PLUS YEARS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THAT IS DIRECTLY INFORMING OUR VISION AND PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR THIS WORK. AND ESPECIALLY WITH CALIFORNIA'S COUNTY BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AND PLANNING. IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT RESPONSIBLY INCLUDES THE EXISTING NETWORK OF SERVICES AND IS ALSO ARCHITECTED IN A HOLISTIC WAY TO ACHIEVE OUR LOCAL VISION AND PRODUCE THE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR WHICH OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ARE RIGHTLY ASKING. BUT IN ADDITION TO LOCAL ENGAGEMENT ARCHITECTING AND PLANNING. WE ALSO NEED STATE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE THE STATE MAINTAINS THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WE NEED THE STATE TO HELP ENSURE ROBUST INTER OPERABILITY BETWEEN NINE ONE ONE AND NINE EIGHT EIGHT. THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE RELIABLE TRANSFER CRISIS CALLS NOT REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT OR EMS RESPONSE FROM NINE ONE ONE TWO NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. ALSO THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES HAVE ILLUSTRATED SEVERAL AVENUES FOR ENHANCING MEDICAID FUNDING FOR CRISIS SERVICES. INCLUDING BETTER USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING FOR CALL CENTERS AND TECHNOLOGY. AND WE WOULD NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE MEDICAL PROGRAM TO EXPLORE AND POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENT THESE MEASURES. AND MORE BROADLY AND EXPANDED CRISIS SYSTEM PROMISES TO OFFSET STATE HEALTH CARE COSTS ELSEWHERE. BY PREVENTING CRISES FROM ESCALATING INTO MORE INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE HEALTH NEEDS. INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE THOSE NEEDS SO OFTEN FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FIGHT TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. BUT WE NEED STATE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT TO HELP IDENTIFY AND CAPTURE THOSE OFFSETS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ADEQUATELY REINVESTED IN THE CRISIS SERVICES THAT HELP TO PRODUCE THEM. WITH SO MANY DISPARATE AND SIDELOAD SYSTEMS FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNDING OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO REALIZE THESE KINDS OF VALUE BASED RETURNS ON INVESTMENT WITHOUT GOING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATE LEVEL. WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN L. A. COUNTY THAT IT WILL REQUIRE HUNDREDS MAYBE THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS BRAINSTORMING AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO CLARIFY THE STATE WIDE VISION FOR CRISIS SERVICES AS WELL AS THE IDEAL ROLE OF THE STATE AND SUPPORTING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT. WITH NINE EIGHT EIGHT ON OUR DOORSTEP THE BEST TIME TO BEGIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN YEARS AGO BUT- SECOND BEST TIME IS RIGHT NOW.

THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED TO ENSURE THAT EMERGENCY SERVICES LAW ENFORCEMENT WELL CRISIS THAT'S AVAILABLE IN A COUNTY CALL CENTERS EXCEPT TRUMP WORK COLLABORATIVELY THIS MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS WORKING WITH THEM ALL OF THE SYSTEMS MUST BE APPROPRIATELY CROSS TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS AND WORK WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES TO DE ESCALATE AND REFER APPROPRIATELY. THIS MEANS THAT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE CALL CENTERS HAVE TO HAVE AN INTEROPERABLE. FORM SO THAT CALLS CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTERACT THIS MEANS THAT WOULD EVER WHETHER.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN BLACK AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR RON CALI BAHAL TRACTOR POINTS COUNTY IN PREVIOUSLY THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THE PAST PRESIDENT CAN BE EVER HELD DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I'M GOING TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF HERE TODAY. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS LIKE ALL OF US ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE MAN'S TRANSFORMATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WHILE FACING EXTREMELY CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND THANKFULLY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE PRIORITIZE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN A STATE WIDE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT WHICH WOULD OCT CALIFORNIA INTO THE 85% MATCH AVAILABLE FOR THEIR SERVICES UNDER OUR BACK FOR A. PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS STARTING THIS APRIL. YEAH YEAR WHEN IT. CALLSNINE DATE. SUPPORT FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR WILL ALLOW OUR NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE CALL CENTERS. WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH FUNDING. FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO ANSWER THE CALL WITH TRAINED VOLUNTEERS AND STAFF. I NEED A CALL CENTER WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE REFERRALS TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES WHO REQUIRE AND MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE. WHERE THOSE SERVICES EXIST TODAY. I'M SURVIVING SURVEY LAST YEAR TWO THIRDS OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES REPORTED THAT THEY DO OPERATE A CRISIS MOBILE CRISIS PROGRAM. AND MANY OF THE MOBILE CRISIS. CAPACITY WE HAD TODAY WAS PUT IN PLACE THROUGH OUR SENATE BILL EIGHTY TWO CRISIS TRIAGE GRANTS. PREVIOUS ITERATIONS AND MANY WERE ALSO STOOD UP WITH AN HSA. AND DOLLARS. THANKS TO FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH BE CHIP BROWN TO AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL MOBILE CRISIS INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AGAIN THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANTS THAT LEAVES PART OF THE STATE WITH LITTLE OR NO INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION BECAUSE MOBILE CRISIS HAS NEVER BANNED A STANDARD MEDICAL BENEFIT AS DR PEPPER NOTED. AND WE GET ALMOST NO REIMBURSEMENT FROM COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. MOBILE CRISIS TEAM COVERAGE IS STILL SOMEWHAT SPOTTY IN CALIFORNIA WITH MANY COUNTIES LIKE SAN BENITO COUNTY. HAVING SUCH A SYSTEM IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO DRIVE DOWN F. P. TO ALLOW FOR A BROAD EXPANSION. WE ARE NOT YET A WHERE HAVE THE EMPTY. OR THE CAT PASS TO PROVIDE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. TO ANY MEDICAL BENEFITS YOUR NEED LET ALONE EVERY CALIFORNIAN BECAUSE I BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS IS TO HISTORICALLY HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED. OR DEVELOPED CHARITY WITH OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE SYSTEM. WE DO SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE TO MORE CLEARLY COMMUNICATE TO CALIFORNIANS WHAT NINETY EIGHT EIGHT MEANS FAR STATE. ON JULY FIRST OUR NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION MY PLANS WILL BE MORE ACCESSIBLE MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN EVER. FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. WE CONNECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO MOBILE CRISIS AND CRISIS SERVICES THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WILL TAKE EVEN MORE INVESTMENT. WE ARE ALL IN FOR THE VISION OF A WELL FUNDED AND SUPPORTED PUBLIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS SYSTEM. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEING PUT FORWARD BY THE L. A. C. FOR CHANGING OUR SB EIGHTY TWO GRANTS. AS IT WOULD REPLACE WHAT HAS BEEN UP UNTIL NOW A CRUCIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR OUR CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. THESE CHANGES TO DIVERT FUNDING TO HOSPITALS- OR TO SEE VIDEOS WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE LINKED IN WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISPATCH SYSTEMS AND REIMBURSEMENT IS SHORT SIGHTED. WE WOULD ASK THE CHANGES INSTEAD ALIGN WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO MOVE AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND STAFFING RESTRICTIONS. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE PROPOSED MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT ALONG WITH THE ROBUST STATE LEVEL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA WILL BE WELL ON HER WAY TO ANSWERING. THE CALL EVERY TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL FROM. YOU EXECUTIVE. FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS TOBY YOU IN WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY H. AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO JOIN YOU- THIS AFTERNOON REMOTELY- AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED THE TIME WITH YOU LAST MONDAY I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BE REMOTE 70% A CHANCE TO DO SO. VERY VERY QUICKLY. YOU KNOW MY COMMENTS REGARDING THE NINE EIGHT SYSTEM IN THE SHIFT AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MAKING. REALLY IS TO- I. RECOGNIZE THAT OUR CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE PAST LARGELY. HAVE BEEN ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND WHEN A CRISIS OCCURS. NINE EIGHT EIGHT IS RECOGNIZING THAT HE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE A SHIFT TO UPSTREAM KINDS OF. ACTIVITIES SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE RELIANCE ON CRISIS SERVICES. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ROBUST. AFFECTIVE CRISIS RESPONSE. AT THAT RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN EVERY COMMUNITY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA WHEN WE NEED THEM. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE IS THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY PAY OUR WAY OUT OF THE INADEQUACIES OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE STATEWIDE. WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRATEGIC AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO UPSTREAM PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION HOW WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE NEEDING CRISIS SERVICES THE WAYS WE CAN FOR THE FIGHT COMMUNITY SERVICES OF THE CRISES DON'T HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO CONSISTENT WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT I PROVIDED IN THE PAST AROUND LPS AND OTHER AREAS WE NEED TO DO THE WORK AND THE DEEP AND EXCEEDINGLY WELL. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE MAKING THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THIS DEFENSE SERVICES. THE COMMISSION HAS DISCUSSED OPPORTUNITIES TO MODIFY SB EIGHTY TWO IN A IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. BUT IT REALLY STARTS WITH THIS RECOGNITION THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM IS ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE TO DO. THE UPSTREAM PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION WORK THAT IS NECESSARY TO BUILD OUT THAT PART OF THE SYSTEM. WHEN EDUCATED TO WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IT WAS DESIGNED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. FOR STAFFING. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING TO- FROM CHAFF- THAT THAT COMPANY HELPS THAT IS FINANCING AUTHORITY. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTING OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS AND OUR BROADER COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR CRISIS RESPONSE AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANT WORK AROUND STRENGTHENING CRISIS RESPONSE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT HAS TO B DONE IN CONCERT WITH STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR THAT KIND OF CARE. CURRENTLY THE WAY S. P. EIGHTY TWO IS STRUCTURED IT DOESN'T ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM KINDS OF STRATEGIES ITS FOCUS REALLY IS ON CRISIS RESPONSE. AND PART OF THAT IS RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE MANY PARTNERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE PART OF AN INTERVENTION. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGY AS EVIDENCED BY MANY OF THE PARTNERS WHO ARE PART OF THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. SO TO THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DISCUSSING WAYS THAT SB TWO COULD BE MODIFIED. TO SUPPORT THOSE UPSTREAM KINDS OF STRATEGIES TO EMBRACE THE BROADER SET OF PARTNERS IN ADDITION TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE PART OF THAT STAT STRATEGY. AND RECOGNIZE THAT INVESTMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THAT SYSTEM NEED TO GO BEYOND PERSON NOW SOMETIMES IT'S RESEARCH SOMETIMES IT'S TRAINING SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THAT SYSTEM AND HOW WE CAN PUT IN PLACE EVIDENCE BASED. OR COMMUNITY TO FIND PRACTICES THAT WILL REDUCE RELIANCE ON THIS CRISIS SERVICES. AND AS PART OF THAT THERE THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OF SPD TO THAT ARE CONCERNING ONE IS THAT IF THE COMMISSION WERE ABLE TO ON BEHALF OF THE STATE INVEST WITH. SOME NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERS THAT WE CANNOT REQUIRE MATCHING FUNDS AND WE THINK THAT THAT FORGOES OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE THE IMPACT THE STATE DOLLARS. AND LASTLY FOR MANY OF THESE PARTNERS A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM JUST DOESN'T WORK PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL AND VERY SMALL COUNTY PARTNERS BUT ALSO FOR MANY OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN BE KEY. IN SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS SO THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO RELY ON A CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. SO YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENT NINE EIGHT EIGHT THE COMMISSION SEES SB EIGHTY TWO IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY RETHINK HOW WE INVET IN CREATIVE STRATEGIES INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO DO THE UPSTREAM WORK. SO THAT WE CAN TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING ARE ADEQUATE TO THE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. TO GET THE CHANCE TO TALK TODAY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KIM PETERSON WHO IS THE SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KIM PETERSON AND I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING TODAY. I'M TESTIFYING ON SEVERAL PANELS THIS AFTERNOON. THE THROUGH LINE OF ALL OF MY TESTIMONY IS THAT THE STATE MUST INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE WORKFORCE AND PROGRAM OPERATION FUNDS THAT WILL SUPPORT VOLUNTARY. COMMUNITY BASED UPSTREAM INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THESE UPSTREAM INTERVENTIONS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO DIVERT PEOPLE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS FROM HOSPITAL AND JAIL STATUS THAT ARE COSTLY FOR THE SYSTEM. AND OFTEN TRAUMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE IN CRISIS. MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE ONE OF THESE CRUCIAL UPSTREAM INTERVENTIONS AND YOUR SEAT WELCOME DH CS HIS DECISION TO IMPLEMENT THE SERVICE AS A MANDATORY MEDICAL BENEFITS. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND DH CS TO CONSIDER. FIRST WE QUERY HOW THE MEDICAL MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH NINE EIGHT EIGHT NINE ONE ONE AND OTHER ENTRY POINTS FOR REQUESTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS CARE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE XDS PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH GUIDANCE FOR HOW TO ENSURE RESPONSES BY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ALL APPROPRIATE SITUATIONS. AND SOME COUNTIES WERE DRC IS CURRENTLY WORKING THE DEFAULT RESPONSE FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS CALLS INSTANCES DISPATCH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ADDITION SOME COUNTIES HAVE ONLY PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY TEAMS WHOSE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONDUCT FIFTY ONE FIFTY S. LAST MONTH IN THE FIELD. NOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY BASED CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICE. IMPLEMENTING THE MEDIC HOW MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT WILL ENTAIL A MAJOR SHIFT APPROACH FOR MANY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DEAR C. WELCOMES THE SHIFT OF APPROACH AS OFFERING TRUE MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES IS A BIG STEP TOWARDS DECRIMINALISING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CURTAILING UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION. SECOND THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE BUDGET HEARINGS THAT I PARTICIPATED IN OR OBSERVED OVER THE LAST MONTH I HAVE HEARD THE REFRAIN WORKFORCE WORKFORCE WORKFORCE. ROLLING OUT THE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT WILL REQUIRE A MAJOR WORKFORCE EXPANSION. IN BUILDING OUT THIS WORKFORCE D. R. C. R. TO THE INCLUSION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PEERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO MATCH THE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. LASTLY DRC REQUEST THAT DHS INVOLVED ADVOCATES AND PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE POLICIES THAT WILL GOVERN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT. THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CRITICAL NEW PROGRAMS MUST BE GUIDED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM PETER MURPHY WHO IS THE OUTREACH MANAGER. AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO I BELIEVE THEY ARE ON BEHALF OF MARK SALAZAR PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANKS VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE MEMBERS- YEAH MY NAME IS PETER MURPHY AND- I'M THE OUT REACH MANAGER FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S A GREAT IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS TESTIMONY. TODAY AND- I'M I'M PRESENTING THIS ON BEHALF OF MARK SALAZAR WHO'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT OF OUR AGENCY THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO- AND WE'RE WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE- THE CALIFORNIA FAIR RUN WARM LIGHT AND ALSO- THE CAL HOPE. MINE WHICH WE HAVE BEEN- ADMINISTERING. SINCE ITS INCEPTION V. THE CAL HOPELINE THE- REACHING OUT TODAY BECAUSE- THE SERVICE THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WAS ANNOUNCED- EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND THE WARM WIND WE WANTED AS I WANT TO DESCRIBE THE WARM WINDS HERE TO- BUT ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT- IDENTIFIES HERE. MYSELF IN IN RECOVERY I HAVE I HAVE ISSUES WITH SUBSTANCES AND ALSO- MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND- I HAVE. I. CAN PERSONALLY TESTIFY TO THE AFRICAN THE BE OF VALUE OF THIS KIND OF- SERVICE AND I WAS REALLY GRATEFUL TO. HAVE ARENA I'M HERE EARLIER WHO IS FROM- UC DAVIS I THINK HAVING THE VOICES APPEARS AT A HEARING LIKE THIS IS REALLY WONDERFUL WE APPRECIATE THAT. SO THE WARM ONE ISN'T ACCESSIBLE NONEMERGENCY RESOURCE FOR ANYONE IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. SINCE NINETEEN SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN OUR PEER COUNSELORS HAVE BEEN OFFERING A HUMAN CONNECTION EMPATHY AND HOPE THE CALLERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THROUGH THE PHONE AND THROUGH PHONE WEB CHAT OR PEER SUPPORT WARM LINE. HAS UNITS POWERED PREVENT CRISIS AND BUILD RESILIENCE. WE'RE SUBMITTING THIS TESTIMONY TODAY TO REQUEST REQUEST ME FUNDING AND EXPANDING THE SERVICES OF THE WARM ONE. THE FUNDING OF THE OF THE- CALIFORNIA. WORK BROAD WARM KIND IS SET TO END AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR ON JUNE THIRTIETH. THAT WOULD MEAN- TRAGICALLY I IT WOULD TO BE A- OF THIS FREE AND ACCESSIBLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. A SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN ACCESSED AND UTILIZED BY NEARLY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE- THE CALIFORNIA PERRIN WARMLY AND ARE COATED NINETEEN FOCUS CAL HOPE WARM WINE ARE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF CRISIS CARE CONTINUUM. ALONG WITH THE INCOMING NINE EIGHT EIGHT ONE. I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY- THAT MANY TIMES THAT THE ENTRYWAY INTO SERVICES THROUGH ITS THROUGH A PHONE CALL. IT'S THROUGH A WEB CHAT- WHICH WHICH WE'RE WE'RE NOW. HOPING TO PROVIDE THREE NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND WE SEE THE SERVICE THAT OUR WARM WIND PROVIDES AS BEING ALSO IN A GREAT ENTRY WAY FOR FOLKS- COMING IN THE NOT ALL THAT OUR HOUSE IS IN A LOOKING FOR CARE. OUR GOAL IS TO ADDRESS THE ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO PREVENT A CRISIS FROM ESCALATING TO THE POINT RATED. NINE EIGHT EIGHT OR NINE ONE ONE OR NEEDED. ALL BUREAU MORE MY HAS A 41% INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF CALLS. AND CHATS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY DECLARATION. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE WARMIND RESPONDED TO NEARLY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CONTACTS. AND THE CALENDAR YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE WARM WIND RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTACTS. WE'RE VERY PROUD TO MEET THE NEEDS OF. THE STATE IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS. OF KOBE NINETEEN. POLITICAL DISCORD WORLDWIDE WILDFIRES IN ECONOMIC STRESS AND- PERSONALLY I FEEL LIKE IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE WARM LINE WAS- IN PLACE. WHEN THE PANDEMIC- STARTED AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO EXPAND SERVICES- TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS STATEWIDE. BUT SAYING THAT WE ALSO- WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO GET TO EVERY CALL THAT WE RECEIVED WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE- WE'RE- WE'RE ASKING FOR- AT NOT ONLY A REFINING BUT HOPEFULLY AND AN EXPANSION OF THE FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE OUR SERVICES- WE EXPECT. WE BELIEVE THAT NOT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN THE NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS- AS WE FEEL THE RESULTS OF- OF THE PANDEMIC. AND OTHER CRISES THAT THAT OUR STATE HAS EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. NOW MORE THAN EVER THE STATE AND ITS UNIQUE COMMUNITIES NEED EQUITABLE AND FAR REACHING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH RISKS. OUTCOMES IN ACCESS TO QUALITY TREATMENT AND CARE. TAKING NO ACTION TO ADDRESS THE FORTHCOMING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION. I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY OUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE THE- THE WARM LINE SERVICE THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING- THAT FITS RIGHT IN I MEAN I MEAN IT'S- WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT PREVENTION. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE SAY. WE CAN SAVE THE STATE. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TERMS OF- HELPING FOLKS GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED BEFORE THEY NEED TO. GO TO ANY R. OR END UP IN A IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY- I MYSELF IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T GET HERE UNTIL YEAH I WAS IN CRISIS AND- I. THERE WAS A LOT I FACED A LOT OF STIGMA AND MY OWN PERSONAL LIFE AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND- IT MEANT THAT IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS HAVING AN EMERGENCY. THAT THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IT- IN OUR MOST RECENT FUNDING. WAS TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH COVERED. OUR EXPENSES THROUGH THROUGH THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AVERAGING THREE POINT SIX MILLION PER YEAR. AND IN- IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTYTWENTY WE USED ABOUT 12% OF THAT AROUND ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION FOR START UP COSTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE IS ONE POINT NINE MILLION OR EIGHTEEN PERCENT. TO BUILD CAPACITY AND MEET THE INITIAL NEEDS OF COVER NINETEEN. M. THIS CURRENT YEAR WERE USING SIX BILLION DOLLARS OR 70% OF THAT. FUNDING TO MEET THE ACCELERATED DEMANDS BY THE ONGOING KOBE NINETEEN CAMPUS PANDEMIC. SO TO CATCH MY BREATH HERE FOR SEX. TO MEET THE GROWING NEED FOR CRISIS PREVENTION SUPPORT AND TO TAKE ON CALLS DURING FREQUENT STATE DECLARED EMERGENCIES. NHS STAFF IS ITS FIRST REQUESTING AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING TO AN AVERAGE OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM JULY TWENTY TWENTY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN INCLUDING THE COST OF MORE PEER COUNSELORS OPERATIONS AND MARKETING AS WELL AS THE EXPECTED INCREASE. IN THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN INFLATION SOME OF THIS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO WHAT WAS ALSO- DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT- THAT. CAL HOPE FUNDS- CAL HOPE SERVICES ARE. SCHEDULED TO- TO ADD- LATER THIS YEAR AND SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT A LOT OF THE CALLERS- THAT WERE CALLING CAL HOPE ARE GOING TO BE- YOUR OR WHO ARE HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO CALL. THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU MORE MONEY INVESTING CREASING ARE ON NEED FOR SERVICES EVEN FURTHER I REALLY REALIZE THAT- THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSED TODAY THAT SOME OF THOSE CALVET SERVICES MAY BE EXTENDED SO IT'S KIND OF A DYNAMIC SITUATION. WE'RE ALSO HOPEFUL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE'S THE DEVELOPMENT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA WARM WHEN COALITION. WHICH WOULD CREATE THE FIRST COALITION OF WARM WINDS AROUND THE STATE COMPLETE WITH TRAINING. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT SMALLER CAN. PEOPLE OF COLOR RURAL AREAS NAY OTHER POPULATION SPECIFIC NEEDS WITH UNIQUE PEER SUPPORT. THE FUNDS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE TO ACHIEVE AN ADDITIONAL GOAL OF ESTABLISHING THIS COALITION AND EXPANDING QUALITY WARM WIND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOUR STANDARDIZED TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ANY COMMUNITY WARM LINE CALIFORNIA WILL BE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER OVER THE PERIOD OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. JUNE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- WE'RE ALSO VERY COMMITTED TO- UP HERE YOUR RECOVERY WORKFORCE AND USING PEERS WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT- BEING PART OF THE WORKFORCE MEANS BEING COMPENSATED PROPERLY FOR IT FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. WHICH IS A REALLY A KEY COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOPED- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN HELPING TO DEVELOP OUR WARM ONE PROGRAM FOR YEARS AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT AND ANY OTHER COUNTY AND LOCAL PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN OFFICIALLY INCLUDED BOTH NINE EIGHTY EIGHT AND NATIONAL PURE CERTIFICATION IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION LAST WEEK I MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY FUNDING TO FORM A CALIFORNIA COALITION OF WARM WINDS. COULD HELP WAS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA'S YOUR ROOM WARM WINDS ARE BROUGHT TO THE COALITION FIRMLY SEATED. AT THE TABLE OF NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. WE TO BE A SAN CAN TO PRAY TO PRIORITIZE THESE. AND LOW BARE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT BY FUNDING AND EXPANDING SERVICES OF THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU WARMIND FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. AND MAKING THIS INVESTMENT IN THE LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. THE INCREASE IN FUNDS- LINKAGES TO EXISTING RESOURCES AND SERVICES. TO CREATE THE LARGEST PEER SUPPORTED MENTAL HEALTH SAFETY NET IN THE UNITED STATES POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHATEVER NEW CHALLENGES LAND STORE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO NO ONE SHOULD BE FACING THE- MOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ALONE AND AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE MY- MY OWN EXPERIENCE I FEEL LIKE WITH THE WARM WIND- CREATES IS A COMMUNITY. OF SUPPORT- AND I FEEL LIKE THAT INCLUDES OUR COUNSELORS AS WELL AS AS WELL AS ALL THE CALLERS AT THE COMMITTEE USER SERVICES- I MEAN I'VE I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONES MYSELF I STARTED ON THE WARM WIND AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- I'VE TAKEN OVER FIVE THOUSAND CALLS MYSELF I IDENTIFIES SOME WHEN I HAVE- I HAVE SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES IDENTIFIES NOT QUALITY IN AN ATTIC. ALSO SOME WITH THAT MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND- I'VE LEARNED I FEEL LIKE I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT I NEED TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND- I'M I'M I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS AND FEEL LIKE THAT FEEL THAT THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL SERVICE THERE WERE REALLY ENCOURAGING THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND- ON BEHALF OF MARK SALAZAR OUR CEO AND PRESIDENT AND- ALL EVERYONE OUR AGENCY THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION. SAN FRANCISCO I WANNA. WHEN I THINK FOR THE SUBURBS. AND ALL OF BACK THE BUT YOUR PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH HEAR FROM OUR FINAL PRESENTER ON ISSUE ONE. CORY HAAS CHEETAH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA COREY SHEET WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THE PROPOSED NEW MEDIC CAL QUALIFYING COMMUNITY BASED. MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION BENEFIT- WE ALSO REENTLY RELEASED A BRIEF ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS WHICH PROVIDE SOME FURTHER DETAIL ON ON THAT AS WELL. FIRST WE WHICH IS FINE THAT- ADDING THIS NEW BENEFIT TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM DOES HAVE MERIT AS INAPPROPRIATELY TARGETS A GAP IN THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUE ONE OF WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES THAT EITHER DO NOT OPERATE ANY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE OPERATE JUST A FEW- TEACH THE US'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT REPORT ALSO IDENTIFIES MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES. AS A KEY AREA TO ADDRESSING THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUE ON- HOWEVER WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE TAKING ACTION ON THIS ON THIS PROPOSAL- WE WOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME KEY DETAILS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED NEW BENEFITS. WHICH ARE NOT FINALIZED TO FULLY ASSESS ITS MERITS- THESE DETAILS WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR THESE. MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES WILL BE DETERMINED- OR HOW THE PAYMENT RATES FOR THE SERVICES- WILL BE DEVELOPED OR HOW THEY WILL ARE AND WHAT THEY WILL ULTIMATELY END UP BEING- YOU KNOW ON THE PAYMENT RATES AS DISCUSSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE. THESE RATES WILL INCLUDE CERTAIN NON SERVICE COSTS LIKE IDLE TIME. WHILE MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE ON CALL. AND THE SORT OF ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS MAKE THIS A KEY DETAILS TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT WHEN IT REVIEWS THIS PROPOSAL- NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEGREE OF NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MOBILE CRISIS RESOURCES LIKELY VARIES BY COUNTY- ALTHOUGH THEIR ESTIMATES ARE VERY ROUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT SHOW THE WHOLE PICTURE OF NEED FOR MOBILE CRISIS RESOURCES- TEACH THE US'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH ASSESSMENT REPORT DOES INDICATE THAT THE LEVEL FULL OP NEED FOR MOBILE CRISIS. TEAMS RANGES WIDELY BETWEEN COUNTIES. THESE DIFFERENCES BY COUNTY MAY RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES- FOR EXAMPLE SOME COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE WORKFORCE TO STAFF THESE TEAMS- AND THESE DIFFERENCES AND LOCAL CAPACITY. OF RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW VIABLE IT IS FOR COUNTIES TO MEET THE STATEWIDE MANDATED REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS NEW BENEFIT- FOR EXAMPLE RURAL COUNTIES MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME MAKING SURE THAT MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. ON A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BASIS WHICH IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS FOR THIS NEW BENEFIT. ON THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER. HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT COUNTIES HAVE SUFFICIENT LOCAL CAPACITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NEW. THIS NEW PROPOSED BENEFIT- FINALLY WE JUST KNOW THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE SURROUNDING. THIS NEW BENEFIT INCLUDES SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR MOBILE CRISIS BEST PRICE- TO INCLUDE IN THE DESIGN OF STATES MOBILE CRISIS- PROGRAMS- THESE WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO REDUCE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT SUCH THAT. INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CRISIS OUR FIRST MET WITH PEOPLE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RATHER THAN- LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. AND ARE PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHICH WE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS THAN ADULTS WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILE CRISIS CARE- ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS STATED THAT IT'S LOOKING INTO THESE- FOR INCLUSION- THE- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT. INCLUDE A FINALIZED STRATEGY FOR HOW TO INCORPORATE THESE BEST PRACTICES INTO THE DESIGN OF THIS NEW BENEFIT- IN ADDITION AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING AT THE AGENCY LEVEL TO. DEVELOP A STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOR THE ENTIRE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUING- INCLUDING MOBILE CRISIS CRISIS- RECEIVING FACILITIES AND THE NEW NINE EIGHT CRISIS HOTLINE. THIS REPRESENTS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARD TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT IMPROVING THIS CONTINUUM OF CARE BUT THE LEGISLATURE MAY. WANT TO SORT OF MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT STRATEGY FROM FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE AGENCY LEVEL- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANELISTS TESTIMONY WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS. I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR AND ASK MY FIRST QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN THE AGENDA IT STATES THAT THE FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AUTHORIZES STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THOSE QUALITY. COMMUNITY BASED MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO FIVE YEARS. THE WINDOW FOR THAT BEGINS ON APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND ENDS ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST. OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. YET DH CS DOES NOT PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS BENEFIT UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. DOES THIS MEAN THAT CALIFORNIA IS MISSING OUT ON NINE MONTHS OF THIS SERVICE AND OF THE ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THE SERVICE. SO I WILL START OUT AND THEN KELLY ON AN AD IN ON THE END ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCH KELLY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF QUARTERS- FOR THREE YEARS THANK YOU- AND SO WE WILL NOT BE MISSING OUT ON ANY OF THE- ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING- IN REGARDS TO THE PROPOSAL. OUT REALLY ALSO NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD TIME TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE VERY COMPLEX ITEMS THAT WERE RAISED ON THIS EXACT HEARING TO ENSURE THAT WE BUILT THE BENEFIT CORRECTLY WE ENGAGE WITH COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS. AS WELL AS ALL OF THE IMPORTANT LINKAGES THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THIS IS NOT A WHITE LIFT THIS IS THE HEAVY IN VERY IMPORTANT LIST WHICH IS WHY WE PROPOSED THE GO LIVE DATE THAT WE DID- BUT JUST WANTED TO ENSURE YOU WE WILL BE DRYING DOWN IN AND I'M TAKING AN- ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE THREE YEARS IS AVAILABLE. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S FEDERAL AUTHORITY FOR THE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT FOR THOSE FIVE YEARS IF THAT HELPS CLARIFY. IT DOES- WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PANELISTS TODAY AND- ALL SPECIFICALLY POINTS TO A DOCTOR VERONICA KELLY THAT WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHAT. IS OUR PIPELINE WHAT'S OUR STRATEGY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE WORKFORCE CONCERNS. SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO- THE MOBILE. CRISIS INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. SURE SO I YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG PIECES THAT WAS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR'S SPECIFICALLY WAS TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE GETTING. PLANNING GRANTS OUT TO COUNTIES AS WELL AS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND- PREVIOUSLY- DR PIPER WALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE BUT DCS HAS AWARDED. THIRTY SIX IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND NINE PLANNING GRANTS TO COUNTIES CITIES AND TRIBAL ENTITIES IN REALLY ON THAT WAS MEANT TO GET DOLLARS OUT FOR BOTH PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO BE READY FOR. STATEWIDE YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILE CRISIS WE KNOW THIS IS A BIG CHANGE. I WE KNOW THIS IS A COMPLICATED POLICY AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO ATTEND. A TO BE PREPARED THAT KELLY BY ALL MEANS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ADD IN REGARDS TO OTHER WAYS THAT WE ARE PREPARING FOR THAT STATEWIDE COVERED IT AND WE FELT STRONGLY THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. FIVE MILLION THAT WE COULD PUT OUT THE DOOR. I'M TO SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BUILDING THE MOBILE CRISIS EVEN AS WE ARE PLANNING OUT THE BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE. OF COURSE WE FEEL THE TENSION OF WANTING TO START. WITH THE POSSIBLE WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ROBUST A QUARTER ENGAGE THEN AND WE LEARN FROM. OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES STANDING AS CORNY AS SHE THAT ONE SIDE- WE HAVE. VERY DIVERSE COUNTIES IN OUR SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO CREATE A BENEFIT THAT'S WORKABLE. ACROSS THE STATE. MY NEXT QUESTION CAN BE FOR JOE FRANKLIN C. HAD SPOKEN. COOPER AND COORDINATION. AND THAT HOW- IN YOUR- GRAPH YOU HAD THE MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE HELP TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S CRISIS RECEIVING OR HOSPITAL THAT'S RECEIVING. AND HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ABOUT. WHO HELPS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS WHO YOU ENVISION WOULD BE ON THOSE TEAMS. SO WE CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND- AND- WHAT THE SHAPE AND FEEL OF IT IS LIKE. SO FOR THE CIVILIAN MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS I THINK WERE YOU KNOW IDEALLY LOOKING AT A TWO PERSON TEAM- AT LEAST ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL- CAPABLE OF ASSESSING AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS CONSISTENT WITH- CONSISTENT WITH THE- 85% MATCH HARPER LAW AND WHAT IT SPELLED OUT THERE AND- IDEALLY THE OTHER PERSON WOULD BE A PEER. SUPPORT SPECIALIST- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT MOST OF THE TIME THOSE TEAMS WOULD BE ABLE TO STABILIZE SOMEONE IN COMMUNITY WITH NO NEED TO ESCALATE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE AT ALL A LOT OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS WERE FAMILIAR WITH. I'VE SEEN RATES OF 70% OR HIGHER THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO STABILIZE SOMEONE IN COMMUNITY AND SAFETY PLAN WITH THEM AND COMMUNITY SO IF THIS IS SET UP RIGHT IDEALLY THIS KIND OF SERVICE REDUCES YOU KNOW HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE NEEDS FOR CRISIS FACILITIES CRISIS CARE- FROM THERE THOUGH. YOU KNOW I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT MOST OF THE TIME IF SOMEONE DOES NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE YOU CAN GO TO A CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITY- LIKE AN L. A. COUNTY WE CALL THEM TO HEAR AUTHORS AND CARE CENTERS BUT THEY'RE REALLY. TWENTY FOUR HOUR. CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITIES- AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THE- IT'S KIND OF CHECKLIST CRITERIA OF YOU KNOW SIGNS TO LOOK FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY THAT WOULD REALLY NECESSITATE GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOM AT THAT POINT. I THINK THEY'RE IDEALLY CALLING NINE ONE ONE IN GETTING EMS INVOLVED SO I THINK THE HOPE IS MOST OF THE TIME YOU KNOW UNLESS THERE'S A CLEAR SIGN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY THAT SHOULD DO WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE SOMEONE TO A PROPER CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITY IF THEY NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. MAYBE THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO THEM FOLLOW UP OFFLINE WITH. THE DEPARTMENT. TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH WHO WAS ON THAT TEAM WHO IS MAKING THOSE. DECISIONS SAID IT'S ESSENTIALLY A TRIAGE OF SORTS- DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT. YOU BELIEVE THEY HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC OR MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND- BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME COMPLICATIONS TO THIS THAT WILL NEED TO BE IRONED OUT AS WE'RE WORKING ON AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP AS I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND IF THAT MEANS WE CAN SEND THEM TO A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT OR A CRISIS RECEIVING- UNIT TO. RATHER THAN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WE MAY MORE APTLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND CRISIS THAT THEY'RE IN- AND WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT KEEPS BOTH. COMMUNITY SAFE AND SENDS PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT PLACE- WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IF I COULD TO THE DEPARTMENT- ON PAGE TWELVE OF OUR AGENDA WITHIN THE THIRD. PARAGRAPH AND UNDER THE THIRD BULLET- THERE IS. I'M LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A COMPONENT OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE CONTINUE ON WE CAN PROVIDE THE SHORT TERM SERVICES THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND- RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OF HOSPITALS THAT I JUST REFERENCED AND WONDERING IF WE CAN USE YES USE- IN THAT CAPACITY. KELLY ARE WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE QUESTION PLEASE. SURE EVERY I AM REALLY HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT AS HELPING ALL OF YOU READ ALL TWO HUNDRED PAGES BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF RICHNESS AMERICA WE TALK ABOUT THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE WHICH IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A PLACE TO CALL SOMEONE TO RESPOND AS A PLACE TO GO CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND THIS IS REALLY ONE OF OUR KEY GOAL WITH THE BEHAVIOR HOW CONTINUE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS TO HAVE EACH COUNTY LOOK AT WHAT THAT FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE IS FOR THE COUNTY IN WHERE ARE THERE GAPS AND I'M CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE KEY COMPONENT AS WE CONTINUE ON THAT NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS AND THOSE WOULD BE. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE- BEING REJECTED FUNDING. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. I'M EARLY WE HEARD ABOUT THE AND- OF USE. PEER COUNSELORS AND I'D LIKE TO. TALK ABOUT THE CAL HOPE WARM LINE- WITHIN THE AGENDA- ONE OF THE- SUBPOPULATIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE BOTH CULTURALLY. SENSITIVE FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT IS OUR YOUNG ADULTS. THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK EXPLICITLY WHETHER OR NOT WE HIGHER USE PEER COUNSELORS- TO HELP US WITH THIS POPULATION. SO WE HAVE JIM COOLER AVAILABLE WHO IS ARE SIGNIFICANT CALVET CHAMPION SO JIM I CAN BE PASSED UP TO YOU TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT THE ON TRACK THROUGH CAL MAYES OF WAR TWENTY NINE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE YEARS WE RELY ON THEM TO MATCH THE- PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT AUDIENCES SO- WE DIRECTLY DO NOT HIRE YOUNG PEOPLE OURSELVES BUT OUR PARTNERS IN THE FIELD MAY BE DOING THAT DEPENDING UPON WHO THEY WERE OUT REACH TO. WE THEN ARE CAL HOPE STUDENTS PORT NOT SPECIFICALLY THE WARM LINE YES WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING EFFORTS THROUGH THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THAT THERE WILL BE A STUDENT COMPONENT USING STUDENTS AS PEERS TO SUPPORT OTHER STUDENTS BUT NOT NECESSARILY SPECIFICALLY ON A WARM LINE- SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON OUR CALVET PEPPERED. I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND- WHAT ELEVATES THE COMMENTS THAT WE HAD IN LAST WEEK SUB ONE HEARING FROM- OUR YOUTH AND PEER SPECIALISTS AS I AS I BELIEVE IT'S- THAT HIDDEN GEM THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TO GOING FORWARD- SEEING AS THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE PANEL ONE. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL TO ON SERVING THE NEEDS OF OUR HIGH NEEDS INDIVIDUALS FOR THOSE PANELISTS WHO ARE PRESENTERS PLEASE PRESENT IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR NAME APPEARS IN THE AGENDA.

S. H. TO IMPLEMENT SEVERAL SOLUTIONS RELATED TO INCREASING ACCESS IS TO SERVICES AND EXPANDING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR ICE TEA ON FELONY CHARGES. FOR MANY YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS BEING REFERRED BY THE SUPERIOR COURTS TO THE DEPARTMENT AS I. S. T. AND THESE AE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED ON A FELONY CRIME. AND DUE TO THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM OR ASSIST THEIR COUNCIL IN THEIR DEFENSE MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE UNTREATED OR UNDER TREATED ILLNESSES. AND HAVE BEEN CYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OVER THE YEARS DEPARTMENT HAS AMPLE MANY. TOWARDS COOPER. INCREASING OF AND READ THEM TO ME THE NEEDS THE INCREASE ICE T. REFER. HOWEVER EFFORTS CAN TO IN IN THEN APART HAS MADE A WAIT LIST FOR ADMISSION THIS WEIGHTLESS AS FURTHER BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE IMPACTS OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AS THE NECESSARY INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES THAT WE HAVE HAD TO IMPLEMENT AT THE STATE HOSPITALS HAS RESULTED IN SLOWER EMISSIONS. AND REDUCE CAPACITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FELL ON THE ICE TEAS AND YES H. TODAY THERE ARE OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AWAITING ADMISSION INTO AN I. S. T. TREATMENT PROGRAM THIS IS T. SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL WAS. INFORMED BY THE I. S. T. SOLUTIONS WE'RE THAT WAS CA. THIS FALL. THE WORKGROUP WAS.

INCREASING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AND DIVERSION INCREASING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONNIE I ISSUES AND MORE BROADLY FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THAT I IT'S TWO SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL PRESENTED TODAY INCLUDES FUNDING FOR SEVERAL STRATEGIES AND COMPONENTS. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING A GROWTH CAP ON ICE TEA REFERRALS FOR ALL COUNTIES AIMED AT ENCOURAGING THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY CARE. BUT GUARDING AGAINST ANY UNINTENDED INCENTIVES THAT MIGHT DRIVE INCREASED FELONY I GUESS T. REFER REFERRALS. MANY TOUCH BRIEFLY ON EACH OF THE COMPONENTS AND I. S. T. PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS STABILIZATION AND EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT FACILITATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY MENTAL JAIL MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. THESE ARE SERVICES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT AT THE EARLIEST POINT POSSIBLE TO I. S. T. INDIVIDUALS ON OUR WAIT LIST. TO PROMOTE STABILIZATION AND INCREASED ELIGIBILITY EMPLACEMENT AND DIVERSION OR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THAT FUNDS REQUESTED WILL SUPPORT THE COST OF PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS INCLUDING LONG ACTING MEDICATIONS MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT. INCREASE CLINICAL IN PSYCHIATRY ENGAGEMENT AND COMPETENCY. EDUCATION AS APPROPRIATE. THE NEXT COME IS THE CARE. AND WAIT LIST MANAGEMENT AND AS WE HAVE I'M CONTINUE TO ADD COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS TO THE MENU OF R. I. S. T. TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE PATIENT MANAGEMENT UNITS ROLE AS THE HUB OF. PATIENT INFORMATION AND COORDINATION TO FACILITATE PLACEMENT CONTINUES TO GROW MORE COMPLEX. SO THE RESOURCES REQUESTED WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO SCREEN ALL FELONY EYES TO PATIENTS TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. PROVIDE ENHANCED MONITORING OF THE WAIT LIST AND PROVIDE COMMITMENT TO ADMISSION CASE MANAGEMENT TO COORDINATE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS AND MAXIMIZE BED USAGE FRIAS TEASE. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL EXPANDING FELONY I S. T. COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING WILL BE A COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION DIVERSION INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FELONY ICED TEA POPULATION. THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION AND DIVERSION PROGRAMS THIS INCOMPLETE INCLUDES BOTH SHORTER. AND LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. I WOULD COMPONENT WE A HOUSING I. FOR CURRENT CONTRACTS WHERE WE PROPOSED PROVIDED FUNDING AUGMENTATION I'M TO OUR CURRENT VERSION CONTRACTS WITH HOUSE BUT COUNTIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF HOUSING AND THIS WILL SUPPORT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FELONY I S. T. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON THE DS H. WAITLIST. TO BE SERVING COUNTY DIVERSION PROGRAMS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS COMPONENT IS A SIGNIFICANT INSTRUCT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO DEVELOP OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. DEDICATED HOUSING TO SUPPORT THE I. S. T. POPULATIONS SERVED IN COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION OR DIVERSION PROGRAMS. YES H. WOULD PARTNER WITH COUNTIES AND OUR COMMUNITY- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND COMMUNITY BATS TO SERVER PROXIMALLY THREE THOUSAND NEW I. S. T. INDIVIDUALS ANNUALLY. ASSUMING AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY MONTHS. FINALLY THE LAST PIECE OF THIS- PROPOSAL IS PROGRAMMING BENDING TO. COMPLEMENT THE INVESTMENT IN DEDICATED HOUSING IDEA STATE PROPOSES TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES TO CREATE OR EXPAND PERMANENT COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR FELONY I S. T. INDIVIDUALS. AND WE PROPOSED TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER CLIENT RATE TO SUPPORT AN EIGHTEEN MONTH AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IN EITHER A COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION OR DIVERSION PROGRAM. THE SERVICES ARE ENVISIONED AS AN INTENSIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT MODEL OF CARE WITH INCREASED CLINICAL ENGAGEMENT IN PSYCHIATRY SERVICES AS WELL AS WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND ONGOING HOUSING SUPPORTS. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THE DRUG TREATMENT AND CLIENT SUPPORT COSTS THE TOTAL RESOURCES REQUESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO SUPPORT NON TREATMENT COSTS RELATED TO PLANNING. COORDINATING AND MANAGING PROGRAMS TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES FOR THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS. TRACKING OUTCOMES DATA AND CONDUCTING AN EVALUATION PROGRAM. AND THEN WILL ALSO AND THE LAST AND FINAL COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS THE INCREASED PLACEMENTS TECH. AND TRANSITIONS AND THIS IS A PROPOSED PILOT OR A NEW INDEPENDENT. PLACEMENT DETERMINATION PANEL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STATE HOSPITAL PATIENTS SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY VIA CONRAD. THIS NEW PANEL WILL REVISE THE COMMUNITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR ROLE THAT IS PART OF CONRAD AND IMPROVE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY OR COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AS OFFENDER WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. THE OVERALL INCREASE UTILIZATION OF CONRAD WILL FREE BEDS IN THE STATE HOSPITAL ALLOW THE PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRULY IN NEED OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF KERR INTO OUR BEDS. SO AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR EVENS WHO WILL DISCUSS THE BUDGET PROPOSALS RELATED. TO OUR EXISTING ISP PROGRAM. THANK YOU START.

THAT CONCLUDES MY KIDS HAPPY TO- MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. PRESENTER THANK YOUNG NEXT TO HEAR FROM DR VERONICA KELLY WHO IS THE CHIEF FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOVERY SERVICES IN ORDER ORANGE COUNTY PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED ARAMBULA AND- MEMBERS THE FIRST ONE I THINK THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND COMMEND THEM FOR THE QUALITY WORK THEY FACILITATED ACROSS COUNTIES TO THEIR VARIOUS INNOVATION INCUBATOR PROJECTS. EACH OF THESE HAS REALLY HELPED THE GROUPS OF PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO INVEST IN IMPROVING QUALITY AND OUTCOMES FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE. LIKE THE JUSTICE INVOLVED IN COMPUTER HELPING US THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX THESE PROJECTS PROVIDE REAL SUPPORT AND HELP OUR MEMBERS TO INFORM PROGRAM AND POLICY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS EMPHASIS ON HOUSING AS A KEY PREVENTION STRATEGY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AS REFLECTED IN BOTH THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS FROM THE DISH I S. T. WORK GROUP WHICH HAS A- RAFT. TIME AND TIME AGAIN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS HAVE CITED A LACK OF HOUSING OPTIONS AT THE KEY SYSTEMIC GAP FOR DRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS WHO ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER OPTIONS. WELL ANYONE EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF LOSING THEIR HOMES WILL REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE POPULATION OF FOCUSED COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THREE OUT OF TEN WHO HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE TO OUT OF TOWN WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. OUR CLIENTS ARE LARGELY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE PAPER HEALTH DISABILITY A MAJORITY OF WHOM WILL RELY ON SSI OR SSD I AM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INCLUDING HELP PROVIDED TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACCESS HOUSING. YES BY THEIR DISABILITY THEY HAVE TO COMPETE IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR HOUSING BY TOP TAX HAVING A CLEAN RECORD BEING IN RECOVERY FROM ADICTION AND MEETING OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF LARGE THAT CAN MAKE SUSTAINABLE. HOUSING ANALYSTS AT. AND ADDITION COMING OUT OF A- PROCESS. OR A JAIL OR PRISON MEANS THAT YOU GET DOWN. ON YOUR PRIOR. FOR HOUSING YOU TOO FAULTY. HOUSING CRITERIA AS YOU LITERALLY LIVED UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S ROOF THEREFORE YOU DON'T QUALIFY AS CHRONICALLY AT ON HOUSE AND SENATE BACK OF THE LINE YOU GO. A SYSTEMIC BARRIERS LIKE MANY OF OUR CLIENTS TO HEROICALLY CONTINUED TO WORK THERE RECOVERY WITH US EVEN WHILE REMAINING ON HOUSE. ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I SIMPLY LACKS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO CONNECT OUR CLIENTS WITH THE HOUSING THEY NEED AND MY RESOURCES I MEAN THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE HOUSING OPTIONS NO APARTMENTS NO ONE CARES NO ROOM AND BOARD. AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN OUR CLIENTS AROUND HOUSE THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE ENGAGED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENTER THE HARMFUL CYCLE CRIMINALIZATION. FOR THIS REASON WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON HOUSING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND REQUEST THAT IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE ACCESS TO. TO MEET THIS AS THE CRISIS IT IS THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE BRIDGE HOUSING FUNDING FUNCTIONS MORE LIKE PROJECT HOME KEY. THAN ANOTHER COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. AND WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER MAKING A MESS AND ONGOING INVESTMENT. OUR CLIENTS CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE A SYMPTOMS OF THEIR DISEASE OF ADDICTION. AND EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS WILL REQUIRE A LONG TERM SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO HOUSING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES BEYOND A FEW YEARS. WE ALSO URGE THE LEGISLATOR. LEGISLATURE TO COUPLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACT INVESTMENTS APPAREL INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL SERVICE DOLLARS. WITH RESPECT TO THE L. INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PROPOSALS WE SUPPORT MUCH OF THE FREE MRKET THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THEM. WE THINK IT AGAINST ELAINE APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTMENT IN A BROADER COMMUNITY BASED FORENSIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTAINMENT CARE. THAT BEING SAD. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE NOTION OF A GROWTH CAP THE WAY TO ADDRESS GROWTH IN THE FELONY ICED TEA POPULATION. BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY SYSTEMS THAT IMPACT WHETHER A PERSON IS ARRESTED. AND CHARGED WITH A FELONY AND DEEMED I. S. T. AND NONE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WELL WE CAN AND DO WORK TO ENGAGE OUR CLIENTS INTO TREATMENT SERVICES WE KNOW THAT 66% OF INDIVIDUALS OR TEAMS I S. T. CHARGED WITH FELONIES WERE ON HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARREST. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND EXPANDED TRADE. JUST LIKE THE VERSION VERSION ARREST AND PRE TRIAL DIVERSION. ALONG WITH IMPROVE COORDINATION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS. FINANCIAL PENALTIES LEVEL LEVY ON COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ONLY TRAIN ALREADY SCARCE RESOURCES FROM TREATMENT PUTTING BIGGER HOLES IN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SAFETY NET AND PUT MORE CLIENTS AT RISK OF HAVING THEIR NEEDS MET WE ASK THE STATE TO ANALYZE THOSE REGIONS OF THE STATE SUCH AS THE BAY AREA WHERE RATES OF FELONY I S. T. REFERRAL HAVE BEEN FLAT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE REFERRAL RATES HAVE NOT GROWN AT THE SAME RATE AS OTHER REGIONS. IN ADDITION IN THE IT WORKER PROCESS WE HAVE PROPOSED IDEAS FOR IMPROVING THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT A FELONY ISPS INCLUDING ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR ALIENIST AND DEVELOPING A STATE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS AND IMPROVING JUST DISCHARGE PRACTICES TO IMPROVE CONNECTION TO LOCAL RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS LEAVING STATE HOSPITALS AND REDUCE THE RISK FOR RECIDIVISM I THANK. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE PERSPECTIVE TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TOBY EWING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN TOBY DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION ON THAT AND THE NEEDS OF% CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE HIGH END NEEDS- AND I AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THE THOROUGHNESS OF THEIR PRESENTATION ON THIS ISSUE- AS OUTLINED IN THE PACKET IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COMMISSION RECEIVED A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES THAT THEY COULD ENGAGE TO PREVENT THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND AT RISK OF. NOT COMING BEFORE THE COURTS WITH AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DESIGNATION THE ENTIRE BACKGROUND OF THE INNOVATION INCUBATOR WAS TO ASK HOW COULD WE BETTER SUPPORT OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS N. DOING UPSTREAM WORK TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND THIS WAS IN PARALLEL WITH THE STATE'S INVESTMENT TO BROADEN COMMUNITY BASED COMPETENCY RESTORATION STRATEGIES. THAT THE INNOVATION INCUBATOR IS REALLY THE THAT GENESIS OF OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT MODIFYING SB EIGHTY TWO HOW CAN WE DO MORE UPSTREAM WORKS TO PREVENT THE KINDS OF CRISES THAT ARE. LIKELY TO SEE THESE NUMBERS GO UP OR OR- THEY'RE DRIVING THEM UP OVERTHE PAST FEW YEARS AS OUTLINED IN THE PACKET WE USE THESE FUNDS TO PARTNER. WITH GROUPS OF COUNTIES IN SOME INSTANCES I KNOW IT DOESN'T COUNTIES AND IN MANY CASES WE ARE LEVERAGING STATE FUNDS AGAINST COUNTY INNOVATION FUNDS OR OTHER COUNTY FUNDS TO REALLY SUPPORT ENHANCE STRATEGIES FOR THEM TO LEARN COLLECTIVELY. ABOUT THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN REDUCE PRESSURE ON NOT JUST A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE BUT BUT DOWN THE ROAD THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. SO OUR DATA DRIVEN RECOVERY PROJECT IT'S ABOUT HELPING COUNTIES BETTER UNDERSTAND PATTERNS IN THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH DATA THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE IMPROVED COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH STRATEGIES- THAT TIES IN VERY NICELY WITH THE NINE EIGHT DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY- THAT CRISIS NOW WORK WAS IN RESPONSE TO. YELLOW COUNTY THAT WAS INTERESTED IN THAT MODEL AND WHAT AND OUR OUR DIRECTION THE OTHER COUNTY WESTERN BRING IN OTHER COUNTIES IF THEY WERE INTERESTED. BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF OUR CRITERIA IS THAT WE WOULD NOT FIND A COUNTY PROJECT THAT WE WOULD FIND MULTIPLE COUNTIES COMING TOGETHER TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. FOR ME TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND LEVERAGE THEIR DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN THESE PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION STRATEGIES- I APPRECIATE THE MENTION AND- DEPUTY SECRETARY WELCH'S COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT TAKE ADVANCE DIRECTIVES. WE HAVE FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE EXPLORING HOW WE COULD BEST LEVERAGE PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES TO AGAIN REDUCE RELIANCE ON ONLINE PORTION BUT IDEALLY. REDUCE THE DURATION OF A CRISIS BECAUSE WE SAT DOWN WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN ADVANCE TO TALK ABOUT. HOW WE SHOULD BE RESPONDING WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES A CRISIS. THAT THE PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVE BECOME IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DURING A POINT WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN CRISIS LAYS OUT A GAME PLAN FOR HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS WHEN THEY ARE IN CRISIS. THIS STRATEGY IS ALL PART OF AN EFFORT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A CONTINUE OF SERVICES AND QUITE OFTEN THE STATE HOSPITALS AT THE IS IT THE DEEP IN THE FINAL STEP. OF THAT SYSTEM. AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT EACH OF THE STEPS PRIOR TO STATE HOSPITAL INVOLVEMENT AND HOW WE CAN FORTIFY THAT STRATEGY. SO VERY QUICKLY THE- BCP IN FRONT OF YOU TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN A WORKAROUND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. RECOGNIZES THAT THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND OUT OF HOSPITALS- SOME- FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND SO TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG AGO THAT WAS. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE HAVE A ROBUST AND WELL FUNCTIONING. FINANCIALLY STABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM FOR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT THAT SHOULD MEAN THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED GOES DOWN AND THAT SHOULD MEAN THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE LANDING IN STATE HOSPITAL SHOULD GO DOWN ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS RECOGNIZING THAT NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN OUR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHO ARE ON THE STREETSWHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED. ARE STRUGGLING WITH PSYCHOSIS AND CAN WE PUT IN PLACE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO. AN EFFECTIVE SET OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO THE PSYCHOSIS DOESN'T BECOME A LIFELONG DISABLING CONDITION BUT A CONDITION THAT CAN BE MANAGED SO THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN RECOVERY AND WELLNESS. TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. AN UPSTREAM FROM THAT AS WE TALKED LAST WEEK IS ARGUED DROP IN OUR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WORK AND SO WE REALLY SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO STRENGTHEN THE UPSTREAM KINDS OF STRATEGIES. IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S ABILITY TO WORK COHESIVELY WITH OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REALLY TAKE PRESSURE OFF THESE DEFENSE SYSTEMS. TO DO THE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION WORK THAT IS AS WE BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY THE STATE IS GOING TO GET ITSELF OUT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT IS SEEING IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WERE LANDING IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS. THANKS VERY MUCH HAVE A ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE DEALT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULATORY ISSUE TO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THE D. ON THE H. THE US'S BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL AND DSHS PROPOSED IC SOLUTIONS PACKAGE- FURTHER COMMENTS ON THESE ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR- RECENTLY RELEASED. REFORM THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR FEEDER HEALTH PROPOSALS AS WELL. REGARDING THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE FIND THE APPROACH TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON BRIDGE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS HAS MERIT THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION FOLKS WHO STRUGGLE WITH BOTH HOMELESSNESS AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH- HAS YOU NEED CARE NEEDS AND WE DO FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL TARGETS A KEY GAPS. IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BY FUNDING BRIDGE HOUSING WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A FOCUS OF MUCH OF THE STATE'S PRIOR SPENDING ON HOMELESSNESS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL EXISTS AT A VERY CONCEPTUAL STAGE RIGHT NOW WITH. KEY DETAILS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE- SUCH AS SORT OF HOW THE FUNDS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE DISTRIBUTED- IN ADDITION YOU WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PLANNING TO HAVE TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL- THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER MAY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF. INPUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ON DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL FURTHER- AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT- THIS TRAILER BILL COULD SPECIFY KEEP PROGRAM DETAILS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE TO SPECIFIC. DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY WHETHER A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM OR A MORE FORMULA BASED ALLOCATION- WHICH MAY RESULT IN FUNDS BEING DISTRIBUTED TO COUNTIES QUICKER- IT COULD ALSO SPECIFY YOU KNOW HOW FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITIZE FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE- WHAT SHARE OF THOSE FUNDS SHOULD GO TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES WHICH- ARE RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT FOR STATE- HOMELESSNESS RELIEF WHICH COME WITH TRADE OFFS- RELATIVE TO FUNDING BEDS IN EXISTING- SORT OF BRIDGE HOUSING SETTINGS. AS WELL AS ANY STATUTORY LANGUAGE NEEDED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR LOCAL APPROVAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IS OFTEN HELD UP BY BY LOCAL OPPOSITION- FOR CONCEPTS THAT WOULD REPRESENT A NEW STATE APPROACH SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES- WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVIDING. PLANNING FUNDS- WHAT'S THE PROVIDING FOR TRADITIONAL APPROACHES SUCH AS SECURING HOUSING IN EXISTING ASSISTED LIVING SETTINGS- NEXT WE JUST KNOW THAT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THESE BRIDGE HOUSING UNITS PARTICULARLY THE TINY HOMES. AFTER THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS EXHAUSTED. EVEN AFTER THE LONGER TERM UNITS FUNDED BY A PRIOR STATE INVESTMENTS COME ONLINE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL STILL NEED THERE WILL THERE WILL STILL BE SOME NEED FOR- BRIDGE HOUSING OPTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IF COUNTIES WANT TO SORT OF. CONTINUE OPERATING THESE BRIDGE HOUSING FACILITIES AFTER THE FUNDING RUNS OUT- THEY WOULD NEED TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN THEY WOULD NEED TO SORT OF USE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO DO SO- AND THEIR CAPACITY TO DO SO IS ULTIMATELY UNCLEAR- FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN THIS PROPOSAL. WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND POTENTIALLY MODIFYING OR EXPANDING EXISTING STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS- WE RAISE THIS TRADE OFF IS A CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS MAY HAVE GREATER CAPACITY TO DEPLOY BRIDGE HOUSING QUICKLY- BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF MAKING HOUSING. AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR DH CS TO ULTIMATELY DISBURSED THESE PROPOSED FUNDS- FOR DS AGES PROPOSED HIGHEST HE SOLUTIONS PACKAGE WE WOULD FIRST NOTE THAT THERE IS ONE PIECE OF PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- SURROUNDING THE PROPOSED CAP ON FELONY ICED TEA REFERRALS FROM COUNTIES- THAT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- IMPORTANTLY THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE OF IC SOLUTIONS. AS A STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSIONS ESPECIALLY WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO UPDATE THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE AT ME REVISED TO INCLUDE ANY CHANGES OR REFINEMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN LATER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. ON THE SIDE M. AS WELL. I'M SPEAKING TO THE KERR INTERIM THIS PACKAGE THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS- INCLUDED REFLECT THE FUEL OF THE I'D IDEAS FROM THE ICE TEA WORKGROUP BUT NOT ALL OF THEM- WE GENERALLY FIND THESE REASONABLE PRIORITIES TO FIND THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE THE EARLY STABILIZATION INVESTMENTS IN PROMISING GIVEN THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT LACK OF EARLY STABILIZATION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO ENSURING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY OPTIONS THREE DS H. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE IC SOLUTIONS WORKGROUP REPORT INCLUDED A VARIETY OF IDEAS- INCLUDING SOME ATTENDED INTENDED TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT MAY LEAD SOMEONE TO BE FOUND I S. T. IN THE FIRST PLACE- SUCH AS THROUGH INCREASED COORDINATION WITH OTHER STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE VERY CONCEPTUAL AT THIS POINT THE LEGISLATURE WE WISH TO MONITOR PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF- SOLUTIONS BASED ON THESE OTHER IDEAS FROM THAT FROM THE ICED TEA WORKGROUP- REGARDING THAT PROPOSED CAP ON FELONY ICE TEA REFERRALS FROM COUNTIES. WE FIND THAT A CAP MAY MAKE SENSE TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO PARTNER WITH THE S. H. ON THESE SOLUTIONS PROPOSALS BUT THAT. COUNTY CAPACITY TO REMAIN UNDER THESE CAPS IS UNCLEAR- FURTHERMORE WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS ISSUE MAY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE STATE CONSTITUTION GENERALLY REQUIRES THE STATE TO REIMBURSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR MANDATED HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICE. GIVEN THAT ELENI I S. T. TREATMENT IS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY- WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSED CAP RAISES QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A STATE REIMBURSABLE MANDATE. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THE BULK OF FUNDING WITHIN THE PROPOSED IST SOLUTIONS PACKAGE AS EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AS AN APPROPRIATION REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A COURT MANDATE- WE FIND THAT THE REMAINING FUNDING WITHIN THE PROPOSED PACKAGE AS WELL AS OTHER FUNDING WITHIN THE S. H. BUDGET. TO COMMENCE FELONY I SPEECH FRIEDMAN IN A TIMELY MANNER MAY ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXCLUSION FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OF FOR COURT MANDATE REASONS- WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXPLORE CANNING THIS ADDITIONAL D. S. H. FUNDING. AS EXCLUDED FROM THE LIMIT. FINALLY THE PROPOSED PACKAGEINCLUDES ONGOING FUNDING TO PILOT AN INDEPENDENT PANEL TO DETERMINE FELONY I S. T. PLACEMENT INTO CONRAD. ONE OF THE S. H. IS COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS- WE FIND THAT PROVIDING ONGOING FUNDING FOR THIS PILOT IS PREMATURE GIVEN THAT ITS SUCCESS HASN'T BEEN ASSESSED YET. AND RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE LIMITED TERM FUNDING INSTEAD FOR THIS PILOT- AND THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME WE ARE HAPPY TO BE OF FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KIM PETERSON SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AGAIN MY NAME IS COMPUTER SENT FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR THIS PANEL I HAVE COMMENTS ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRANCH HOUSING PROPOSAL AND I. S. T. SOLUTION PACKAGE. WITH RESPECT TO THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL DSHS APPRECIATES THE PROPOSED UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH SEVERE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DISABILITIES. FOR MANY ON HOUSE PEOPLE HAVING STABLE HOUSING WILL BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THEIR RECOVERY JOURNEY. DRC OR JUST ANY HOUSING MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL. TO BE OFFERED IN ACCORDING TO HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. HOUSING FIRST IS AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL THAT USES HOUSING AS A TOOL FOR RECOVERY RATHER THAN AS A REWARD FOR MEETING CERTAIN TREATMENT GOALS SERVICES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS HOUSING IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON PARTICIPATION AND OR SUCCESS AND SERVICE. IN ADDITION WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HOW AND WHETHER THE BRIDGE HOUSING WILL CONNECT PEOPLE DEPARTMENT SUPPORT OF HOUSING. SUPPLY OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS CURRENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET DEMANDS AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WILL COME ONLINE RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR SMOOTH TRANSITIONS FROM BRIDGE HOUSING. WE ASK THAT DH CS ACCOUNT FOR THIS WHEN DEVELOPING THE POLICIES THAT WILL GOVERN THE BRANCH HOUSING PROGRAM. IT WOULD BE A WASTED OPPORTUNITY IF PEOPLE RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEIR TIME AND BRIDGE HOUSING ENDS BEFORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECOMES AVAILABLE. TURNING TO THE IC SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL DRC APPRECIATE SOME DIRECTION REFLECTED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE S. H. SUGGESTS MOVING TOWARDS A PRESUMPTION THAT ALL PEOPLE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. SO FIRST BE CONSIDERED FOR PLACEMENT IN AN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM. WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CLOSELY ANALYZED YES AGE AND ITS PARTNERS ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE BOLD GOALS OF CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROGRAMMING NECESSARY. TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE OF FIVE THOUSAND COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION AND DIAPERS AND PAD OVER THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS. D. R. C. 1100% SUPPORTS THE EFFORT TO TREAT FELONY I JUST USE MY COMMUNITY WHEN I WAS SERVICES AND SET THEM ON A PATH TOWARDS BREAKING THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS DISENGAGEMENT FROM TREATMENT. AND CANNELLA EAGLE INVOLVEMENT THAT IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE STATE'S CURRENT HIGHEST YOU CRISIS. HOWEVER CERTAIN FACTORS BEYOND YES THEY JUST CONTROL SUCH AS NIMBYISM HOUSING SCARCITY AND WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WILL HAVE TO BE NAVIGATED IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE CALLS ARE REALITY. LASTLY IN DRC OPPOSES THE PROPOSAL TO LIMIT PARTICIPATION OF DEFEAT S. H. FUNDED MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. ELIMINATING ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING FOUND INCOMPETENT IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE CYCLE THAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE IDEA STATES HAS IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE CURRENT IC CRISIS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WE HAVE A STEPHANIE REGULAR OUR SYSTEM PUBLIC DEFENDER CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- SHE'S NOT HERE. THANK YOU THE WILL HAVE A MICHAEL RISHER. I'VE OF COUNSEL ACLU FOUNDATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU COUNCIL TO THE EAST SO YOU'RE GOING TO CALIFORNIA AND I WAS PART OF THE VENUE LITIGATION THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS REQUIRE THE STATE START PROVIDING CONFERENCE THE TREATMENT. WISE TWO DEFENDANTS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE COMMENCEMENT ORDER. THE- THE STATE'S APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS A VERY WELCOME CHANGE OF DIRECTION FOR DECADES THE STATUS AFTER FIVE- INCARCERATION PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL BASED PROGRAMS IN THIS PROBLEM STATE HOSPITAL AND I WAS FINALLY REALIZE YOU CANNOT BUILD ITS WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND IS EMPHASIZING OR PRICKLY DIVERSION AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT'S A FANTASTIC DEVELOPMENTS MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS MUCH BETTER MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE A BAD MISTAKE HOSPITAL CAN COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. EIGHT COMMUNITY TREATMENT AND WHAT'S HOUSING COSTS A MERE FRACTION OF THAT. SO THE OVERALL APPROACH HIS EXCELLENCY MIDLEVEL OF COURSE IN THE DETAILS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE- SIGNIFICANT ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IN THAT TRAILER BILL. THE FIRST ONE IS ONE OF MS. PETERSON'S MENTIONED IN THAT IT WOULD AMEND THE DIVERGENT VALUES TO NARROW YOUR GOALIE FOR DIVERSION AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG DIRECTION TO BE GOING WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING THE VERSION NOT LIMITING IT. SO CURRENTLY AND I IS TO DO A BROAD DEFENDER CAN BE DIVERTED YES I HEAR SHE IS FOUND R. S. T. OR IF FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE PERSON AND- THAT PERSON IS LIKELY TO BECOME MYERS T. WHAT THAT MEANS YOU CAN DIVERT SOMEBODY EARLY IN THE PROCESS WITHOUT WAITING MONTHS FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE COURT HEARING. YOU ACTUALLY FIND THE PERSON I S. T. E. R. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD CHANGE. AND THAT'S THAT'S A BAD IDEA FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE DEPORTED AFTER WAIT MONTHS OFF IN JAIL OFTEN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WITH NO TREATMENT BEFORE THEY CAN BE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY AND ALSO IT WOULD NARROW ELIGIBILITY PEOPLE WHO ARE WE'RE NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE YOU WOULDN'T BE DIVERTED- WHICH- IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE- THE STATE IS ALL. NOT USING. ITS TO ENTICE THE STATE I MEAN. LOCAL COURT TO ARE NOT USING THE EXISTING DIVERSION CAPACITY AS MCCARTY EARLIER THAN SAY A PROGRAM THAT HAS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY BEDS. ARE PROJECTS OF WHICH ONLY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AND ACTUALLY BEEN USED WE HAVE ACCESS TO PASSAGE OF PERVERSION WE CAN USE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE DO NOT- NARROWING ELIGIBILITY FOR DIVERSE- WHICH IS GOING TO LEAD TO EVEN MORE EXCESS CAPACITY. THAT'S A BAD IDEA. THE SECOND ISSUE. IS THAT. THE STATUTE AMERICANS ELEVEN SEVENTY AGE QUITE APPROPRIATELY TO TRIED YOU. ARE INCENTIVIZE OR PROMOTE DIVERSION A COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. HOWEVER IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO. OVERCOME YEARS AND YEARS OF. HABIT OF SENDING PEOPLE TO LOCK. THE PROPOSAL WITH THAT IF THE COURT IS ITS OUT FOR OF BASED. MEANING THAT CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. AND IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT AND THERE'S NO DOUBLE BED. THE COURT SHALL FIRST CONSIDER SPENDING THE PERSON. WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THIS YEAR'S OF- AS I SAID NURTURING TRADITION WE NEED A PARADIGM SHIFT. THE STATURE CAN SIMPLY SAY THAT IF SOMEBODY'S ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION OF TREATMENT EFFECTS ARE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE AND APPROPRIATE TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THERE'S AN OPENING. THEY SHOULD BE SENT TO THAT'S LOST IN MASS THERE ARE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE MILITANT OTHERWISE OTHERWISE WE'RE SIMPLY GONNA HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY WHICH DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD. REPLACEMENTS AND- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A PROPOSED CAP ON OUR ADMISSIONS AND THAT'S BEEN CRITICIZED BY THOSE WHO MENTION AND RIGHTLY SO WE DON'T NEED TO CAP. THE OUR STATE ITSELF AS WE DO NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCIENCE TO CRISIS TO PROVIDE TREATMENTS AT THE STATE WANTS ARE FOR PEOPLE IN THE STATE WANTS TO PROSECUTE. AND ISSUE THAT UNIFORMLYTHROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SHOULDN'T PUNISH COUNTY. DOCTORS BEYOND THEIR- PARTICULAR BECAUSE THAT WAY UP. IRAN G. IN THE- WERE. BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THE STATE STREET UNIFORM PROVIDE FRIEDMAN TO PEOPLE. VATICAN NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SANDRA SEIDENBERG FAMILY MEMBER OF A NICE T. PATIENT PLEASE BEGIN. OR GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HEAR ME. LOUDLY AND CLEARLY PLEASE CONTINUE OUT RETIRED SOCIAL WORKER AND MY COUSIN'S NAME IS JOHN ON HASHES I TESTIFIED DURING THE GROUND BEFORE THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME JOHN HAD BEEN IN CUSTODY AT THE KERN COUNTY PRE TRIAL FACILITY FOR OVER A YEAR WITHOUT TRIAL. HE WAS APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN BY THE SYSTEM MY TESTIMONY LED TO THIS TRANSCRIPT TO A STATE HOSPITAL. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO TESTIFIES BEFORE STATE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS DIAGNOSED AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL TRANSFERRED FROM PROLONGED AND DAMAGING CONFINEMENT AT THE COUNTY JAIL. I'M ALSO HERE TODAY BECAUSE I THINK JOHN AND SO MANY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE CIRCULATING. THROUGH THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO BEGIN WITH. THEY NEED TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILY. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND RECEIVING TREATMENT. MY COUSIN WAS ARRESTED CHRISTMAS DAY IN CURRENT COUNTY TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS CHARGED WITH MAKING THREATS. TWO VERBAL CONFRONTATIONS DIRECTLY LINKED TO HIS MENTAL ILLNESS HE HAD NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS MY COUSIN HAS NEVER BEEN VIOLENT. HE USES WORDS. AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE A JUDGE FOUND JOHN TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. IT'S NOW BEEN ONE YEAR SINCE HIS COMPETENCY DETERMINATION. HE WAS JUST TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. BEFORE HIS TRANSFER JOHN WAS LOCKED UP IN A CELL FOR OVER TWENTY THREE HOURS A DAY. YOU DID SEE RECEIVE SOME TREATMENT THROUGH ITALICIZED HIGH INTEREST ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES SOCIAL WORKER VISIT HIS CELL DOOR. FOR THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO HE WAS ALLOWED OUT OF YOURSELF HE WOULD TAKE A SHOWER AND EVERYTHING CALLED ME. EVERY DAY HE'D ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION WHY AM I GOING TO GET OUT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HIM. MY COUSIN AS ARTISTIC. AND HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER. FROM THE TIME THAT HE WAS A YOUNG BOY HE WAS IN AND OUT OF MENTAL HOSPITALS. JOHN'S MOTHER WAS JUST ROCK HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF HER. ONE MONTH AFTER JOHNSON PARTURITION SHE PASSED AWAY. HE DIDN'T EVEN GET THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS MOTHER. WHEN JOHN WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY HE LOST EVERYTHING IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. EVERYTHING I AM GRATEFUL THAT SEAN HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE HOSPITAL BUT IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO BEST AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT AND NEITHER DOES HE- HE DOES CALL ME HE ASKED. HEY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ALL. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT HE STILL HAS FELONY CHARGES PENDING FOR ONCE AGAIN A NON VIOLENT OF THAT. WHICH IS CLEARLY RELATED TO HIS MENTAL ILLNESS ISN'T THAT WHY WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS SHOULDN'T HE BE A CANDIDATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT RATHER THAN GET A CRIMINAL RECORD AND BE AND LOCK UP. I BELIEVE THAT IF MY COUSIN HAD BEEN TRACED TO THE COMMUNITY TREATMENT. HE WOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT TREATMENT HE WILLINGLY TAKES HIS MEDICATIONS NOTHING IS BEING FORCED ON HIM. AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WE WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR HIM BUT BECAUSE OF HOPE THAT THE SERVICES WERE LACKING THEY WERE NON EXISTENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM COME HOME AT RECLAIM IS LIVE. I BELIEVE THAT HE CAN BENEFIT FROM A ENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM THIS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE CLOSE TO HOME. HERE HE NEEDS AND AVOID A CONVICTION ON HIS RECORD. I ALSO HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA REFORM SEX CRIMINAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. THE MOBILE HEALTH CRISIS SERVICE THAT I'M HEARING ABOUT SOUNDS FABULOUS I WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO MY BECAUSE- ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY NO MATTER WHERE THAT UNITY IS. IN JAIL SHOULD NOT BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE ABANDONED AND FORGOTTEN. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. THANK YOU SANDRA FOR THE POWERFUL TESTIMONY. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DOCTOR AND RE GAY AND WE DANOS CEO OF THE COMMUNITY ASED COORDINATION SOLUTIONS PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU TERRIBLE ON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I BELIEVE I'M A EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BASED IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON AND I WAS INVITED TO PRESENT DUE TO MY FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SETTING UP A PROGRAMS OF CARE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR WHAT WE CALL OUR HIGH UTILIZES INDIVIDUALS THAT USE. RESOURCES IN A LARGE QUANTITY INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND HOMELESSNESS I THINK MOST OF US WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS PATIENT POPULATION WILL TELL YOU THAT. OFTENTIMES THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THEIR SILOS AND THEY'RE NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PATIENTS THAT NEED THEM. I'M GONNA SHARE. A- SHORT POWER POINT SEQUENCE THAT I HAVE. WE HAVE FOUND THAT- THERE ARE THREE BASIC COMPONENTS YOUR DOCTOR ARAMBULA MENTIONED THE PARADIGM SHIFT WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES TO REALLY CREATE THAT PARADIGM SHIFT BUT WE FOUND IN OUR WORK THAT TO DO THAT WELL TO CAKE CARE COORDINATION EFFORTS WE NEED TO FOCUS. ON THREE AREAS NEED TO HAVE ENGAGEMENT. DIRECT PATIENT ENGAGEMENT HAS TO BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PATIENTS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIX THREE SIXTY FIVE. MISTER YOU AND EARLIER TALKED ABOUT UPSTREAM PREVENTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO CAPTURE AND HELP INDIVIDUALS BEFORE CRISIS OCCURRED WE WANT ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS IN REAL TIME. AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH EVERY ENCOUNTER. ITEM NUMBER TWO IS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE VARIOUS RESOURCES WE HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES DOING GOOD WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT THEIR SILOS. AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HOSPITAL'S EDIE'S EXISTING CARE TAKERS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUBSTANCE USE AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDER AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER SO WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING EFFORTS AND FINALLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES. AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGES ARE BEING USED CORRECTLY. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIX FIVE NOTIFICATION SO THAT WE CAN. ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS DURING MOST CRISIS AND HELP THE END USERS SUCH AS EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. ADDRESS THEIR CARE AND CONNECT WITH RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. CORRECTLY WE'VE USED THOSE THREE TOOLS TO CREATE THE PARADIGM SHIFTS IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN INNER CITY WASHINGTON. IN RURAL ALASKA. AND IN SUBURBAN VIRGINIA AND WHEN WE DO THAT CONSISTENTLY WITH THOSE THREE TOOLS WE SEE. 425260% REDUCTIONS IN UTILISATION STRUM BATIC REDUCTIONS IN OPIOID UTILIZATION. AND DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN COST AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE COST IS ABOUT THE PATIENT CARE. AND THE RESOURCE CONNECTIVITY BUT FOR US TO MAKE SURE OR PROGRAMS OR LONG TERM AND PERMANENT THEY HAVE TO BE SUSTAINABLE. SO I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF JUST TAKING SOME DATA FROM SONOMA COUNTY DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA. THAT IDENTIFIED SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED HIGH UTILIZES. AT A COST OF TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL JUST FOR MEDICAL AND SHELTER COST. AND WHEN WE APPLY THE 40% REDUCTIONS THAT WE CONSTANTLY SEE WITH THE TOOLS WE'VE MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS FOR EACH TWENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND ROLE IS DEFINITELY. A SUSTAINABLE CARE MODEL SO I'M PUTTING MY CONTACT INFORMATION APPEAR I WELCOME QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HER. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TYLER RINDE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN ARAMBULA LINE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TYLER INDIAN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES- CAB HE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE CATERPIE REPRESENTS FIFTY SAPS FIFTEEN AT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA PROVIDING SERVICES YOUR TRUCK MEDIC COW. AND A POPULATIONS WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO DATA FROM THE CDC'S NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS SHOW THAT NATIONALLY THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS WHO DIED BY OVERDOSE FROM MAY TWENTY TWENTY TWO APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MORE THAN SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND OFTHESE FACTS WERE RESULT OF SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS OR PANTS AND ALL CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED A 45% INCREASE AS MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DIED DURING THE SAME TIME. THIS IS A CRISIS AT NEW HEIGHTS AND ONE PREVENTABLE DEATH IT'S TOO MANY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A FOCUS ON HARM REDUCTION M. A. T. OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND-REVERSAL HOUSING AND. RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES. WITH A DEGREE ON HOW AND WE ARE SUPPORT OF THIS AFTER AND- IN BEHAVIORAL BRIDGE HOUSING. PROVIDERS SHARE WITH ME ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR CLIENTS EXIT THE STREETS AND A RESIDENTIAL AT STUDENT SERVICES. AND ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT FINDING HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS AFTER RESIDENTIAL. FOR EXAMPLE 60% OF INDIVIDUALS START THEIR SAN FRANCISCO STRUCK MEDIC HOW ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- IN THE FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- NUMBERS. STABLE HOUSING IS CRITICAL FOR LONG TERM RECOVERY. OFTENTIMES THESE INDIVIDUALS ALSO NEED SERVICES THAT HELP FACILITATE THE RECOVERY AND THERE'S THIS BAND HOUSING. IS INCLUDED- HOW TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT WRITING CHECKS GREEN SPACE JOHN- JOB SKILLS INCLUDING THE USE OF COMPUTERS AND OTHER- SKILLS AND- SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. ADDITIONALLY WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INTERSECTION AND OVERLAP WITH THE FAMILY AND COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DISCUSSION THAT'S BEEN HOT I'M IN THIS PANEL TODAY. A HIGH NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES- HOW COOL OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS AND WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE BACK FOR GOTTEN PARTICULARLY WHEN. INDIVIDUALS ARE ON DIVERSION PROGRAMS. ADDITION WE IT'S- THAT THE LEAD. PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S ASK FIFTY. BY SENATOR WIENER WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. TO ESTABLISH OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS BE SUCCESSFUL EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SET UP IN CANADA AND EUROPE AND MOST RECENTLY IN NEW YORK CITY- TO THE TO NEW YORK CITY PROGRAMS WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'VE ALREADY REHEARSED OVER. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOT SEVENTY OVERDOSES SINCE OPERATING IT ALSO REDUCED- SYRINGE LETTER AND A NEIGHBORING PARK BY OVER NINETY PERCENT. OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN RESTORED- SHOWN TO REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE INCLUDING PUBLIC DRUG USE DISCARDED SYRINGES. HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS AND OVERDOSE DEATHS. PEOPLE WHO USE SUCH A PROGRAM IN CANADA WERE MORE LIKELY TO ENTER TREATMENT AND MORE LIKELY TO STOP USING DRUGS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIMELY TO PASS AN AUTHORIZED THESE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. EDITION ONLY ONE OTHER BEAR THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION TODAY. IS THAT- THERE'S AN OVERDOSE REVERSAL MEDICATION ON THE MARKET CLOCKS IT OUT WHICH IS AN EIGHT MILLIGRAM NALOXONE NASAL SPRAY. WHICH IS DOUBLE THE STRENGTH OF THE FOUR MILLIGRAM NALOXONE NASAL SPRAY IN OUR CAMP. I'M WITH THE RISE IN THE SPREAD OFFENSE AND ALL WHICH IS FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROIN. WEEK TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE TELLING ME AND LETTING ME KNOW ON THE GROUND THAT THEY HAVE STARTED TO USE TWO DOSES ARE. ON THE FOUR MILLIGRAMS SPRAY AS- STANDARD PRACTICE TO REVERSE AN OVERDOSE BUT HAVE. THERE'S ALSO BEEN CASES WHERE THEY'VE HAD TO USE UP TO FIVE TO SIX OUNCES OF- OR MILLIGRAMS BRIGHT. WE APPRECIATE BY CLOCKS AND- WITH NOW ON THE MEDIC CALIFORNIA MARY BUT BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT'S ALSO COVERED ON THE STATE'S THE MARKS AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT UNDER GATES YES. WELL TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE AWARE THAT YOU MAY NEED TO USE MORE THAN ONE DOES OUT IN A BOX ON. YOUR THAT THE LAY INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A WHERE. AND WITH THE ADVENT OF FAN AND ALL ITS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE A TO RIVER OVER. VISION WE WERE LOOK FORWARD TO HEAR MORE DE ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S CARE COURT- I'VE PROPOSAL. AND ITS IMPLICATIONS AND INTERSECT. WITH ACTIONS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE. I'M CAPPY MEMBERS STAND READY TO ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU AGAIN AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CHEN ADDS ANY PARTY IN WHO IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR DPA PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU YOUR NAME IS JACKSON ABOUT DAN AND I'M A CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE TOOK POLICY ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION PROMOTING DRUG POLICIES GROUNDED IN SCIENCE COMPASSION. HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS- I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE NEED TO REDIRECT SERVICES RENDERING INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENT HIGH NEED. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS THE LIFESAVING AND CRITICAL SERVICES FOR OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS- MANY OF THE COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE ALL THE PLAYS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IN MY TESTIMONY SUMMIT I KEEP IT REALLY BRIEF AND SHORT- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT- PROPOSALS LIKE BRIDGE HOUSING I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT TREATMENT IS A CONTINUUM AND MANY TIMES FOLKS THAT ARE IN TEMPORARY HOUSING OR THINGS LIKE RIDGE HOUSING WE DO NEED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND YOU NEED ACCESS TO HARM REDUCTION- SERVICES AS WELL- WE KNEW THAT FOR EXAMPLE WITH A J. GREEN KEY. ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE IN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM ALTHOUGH THEY HAD TEMPORARY HOUSING DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES INCLUDING ACCESS TO SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM SERVICES HARM REDUCTION SERVICES. WHICH MADE- MADE IT A LOT HARDER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN EVEN THEIR TEMPORARY HOUSING- UNITS THAT THAT THEY WERE FORTY DURING THE PANDEMIC WE ALSO SAW HIGH NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS UNFORTUNATELY. DIE IN THESE TEMPORARY HOUSING UNITS ON BECAUSE THERE WAS NO COORDINATED DELIVERY OF THE OF ALL THE SERVICES THAT FOLKS NEED IN ORDER TO- YOU KNOW IN SHORT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES OR MAKE IT FOR ANOTHER DAY SO THEY COULD AT LEAST ACCESS TREATMENT WHEN THEY'RE READY AND SO WE'RE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. WRAPAROUND SERVICES EVEN FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE. ABLE TO ACCESS TEMPORARY HOUSING- THE NEED FOR THOSE LINKAGES. ARE ARE ARE PRESENT NOW MORE THAN EVER- AND LYFT LIKE- ALSO LIKE TO- RECOMMEND THAT WE- SECURE THAT. OF SB FIFTY SEVEN ON OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY AND IN THE TREATMENT OF HIGH NEEDS INDIVIDUALS. OPC IS NOT ONLY PROVIDE A CLINICAL BASED SETTING TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE. DIES ANOTHER OF AN OVERDOSE THAT MORE CLEARLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE CONNECTED TO THOSE SOCIAL SUPPORTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. IN THEIR RECOVERY AND INCLUDE ACCESS TO BOTH HEALTH AND- MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING RESOURCES AS WELL AS FOOD. AND JOB TRAINING- HAVING OF PC'S WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. YOUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY PLANS WILL PROVIDE A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE ARD TO SERVE. HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA'S DRUG TREATMENT NAVIGATORS WHICH MAKE THESE LINKAGES FOR THOSE FOLKS ON THE GROUND. AND ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING A WARM HANDOFF. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS THE RACIAL EQUITY AND CITIZENSHIP STATUS OF THE HIGH NEEDS POPULATION. CALIFORNIA PROVIDING SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT IS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND IN LANGUAGE AND DOES NOT CREATE MORE BARRIERS FOR THE STATE'S NONCITIZEN. POPULATION IS KEY HERE- WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES WITHOUT FEAR OR STIGMA AND WITHOUT THE HEAVY HAND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR ICE ENFORCEMENT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE IS NEEDED- ADDITIONALLY- WE ALSO- ONE ECHO OF THE PRIOR PANEL ON THE NEED FOR. PEER TO PEER MODELS- AND SUBSTITUENT LIAISONS AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE FROM WITHOUT US. I'M BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WILL HELP. ALLOW THE STATE TO MAKE DEEPER INROADS ON WITH COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN ARE HARD TO SERVE IN HARD TO REACH. AND THEN FINALLY SHIFTING AWAY FROM CRIMINALIZATION AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS ARE ACCESSING THE SERVICES THEY NEED- EN LA FOR EXAMPLE. WE RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED A PROGRAM. THAT MEANT HEALTH TEAM WRIST NINE ONE ONE. RECOGNIZE THE FACT AND THE IN YOUR INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OFTEN CAUSE MORE TRAUMA. TO THOSE IN NEED TO SERVICES WE COULD GO WE ACTUALLY WOULD RECOMMEND GOING A STEP FURTHER AND ENSURING THAT THESE TEAMS. HAVE STAFF A REDUCTION ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY BUILD TRUST. AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND THOSE ARE ON HOUSING NEEDS OF CRISIS SERVICES. TO ENSURE AGAIN THAT THERE IS A WARM HAND OFF. THE INDIVIDUAL ALONG WITH A CARE PROVIDER IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR THE CARE. AND SHOULD NOT BE LEFT TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR OR OR ANY OTHER BARRIER- TO CAUSE MORE TRAUMA THAN CARE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF OUR PRESENTERS FOR ISSUE TO ALL. BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SEEING NON I WILL. KEEP IT WITH THE CHAIR I WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR EITHER J. C. COOPER DR PFEIFFER. I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE BRIDGE HOUSING. PROPOSAL- WITHIN THE PROPOSAL. IT STATES THAT DH CS EXPECTS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO IMPROVE COORDINATION. TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH ACUTE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU EXPECT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION TO SERVE PEOPLE AND WHAT SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY WILL WE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THIS. WOULD YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT QUESTION. SURE HE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED BY THE COUNTY MANAGED CARE THAT THE BAY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. HAS THE- MOST OF THEM PARTICIPATED MEDICARE MANAGED CARE AND WE ARE LAUNCHING NEW SERVICES IN CALLING. BETTER THAN HAND CARE MANAGEMENT WHICH REQUIRED THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DESIGNATE A COMMUNITY BASED- COORDINATOR MANAGER WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL SERVICES NEEDED BY A CLIENT WHETHER THOSE ARE SOCIAL SERVICES MEDICAL SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ARE COORDINATED IN IN CALAIS MORE ALSO EXPECTING MATCH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH ORGANIZATION LEAD TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE EXCHANGING DATA WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS SPECIFICALLY TO MAXIMIZE CARE COORDINATION SO WE SET UP A PROGRAM CALLED THE VEHICLE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH- HAS A SET OF MILESTONES AND METRICS THAT- REQUIRED B. PLANS AND PENALIZE THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS TO EXCHANGE DATA AND LIKEWISE ON IS CARE. WERE HAVING THE SAME SET OF EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE THEY DON'T COME AS A- MEDICAL CARE ONE PART OF THE IRAQ CARE ANOTHER CARD YET. A LOT OF A CALENDAR DOING ANY IN OUR EFFORT TO- SUPPORT WHOLE PERSON CARE HE IS GETTING THE HEALTH PLANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR ABOUT TO STEP UP AND WORK TOGETHER. KATIE DID I MISS ANYTHING. NO BUT THAT WAS THANK YOU. ALONG THE LINES THEN FOLLOWING WITH WHAT GENET BUT HAD JUST SAID I IT IS THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES YOU WERE MENTIONING. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE PLACED IN LONG TERM HOUSING. CAN STAY SUCCESSFULLY WITHIN THAT LONG LONG TERM HOUSING THAT I'D LIKE. TO KNOW SINCE KELLY MS A PROPOSAL THAT WILL TAKE AWHILE FOR US TO GET UP AND RUNNING. HOW WE WILL HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED WILL BE BOTH PROVIDED AND ACCESSIBLE. I'M HOPING YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE SEQUENCING- OVER THIS BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL. THE ALL STAR AND THEN KELLY BY ALL MEANS YOU CAN ADD ON SO I THINK YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAKE UP THAT WE'VE HAD OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFERINGS IS THE HOUSING SWEET SO. ON MAJORITY OF A PLANS ACROSS THE STATE ARE PICKING UP THE HOUSING TRANSITION SERVICES THEY HOUSING DEPOSIT AND THE HOUSING LIAISON SERVICES ONCE SOMEBODY IS HOUSE. I'M SO I THINK THERE IS BROAD OPPORTUNITIES ALSO AYE WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE TAKE UP OVER THE YEARS WHICH WE POSTED THE SCHEDULE ALL COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AROUND THAT ONLINE. AROUND RECUPERATIVE KERR IN RECUPERATIVE CARE CAN BE PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BOTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS I'M TO MAKE SURE OF BUILDING THAT FULL CONTINUUM IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE GOOD CANDIDATES FOR THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. AND THEN WORKING TO YOU OUT LINK THOSE PIECES ACROSS ARE YOU MENTION THOUGH. IT IS NOT STATEWIDE TODAY- THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THAT THE MAJORITY OF. A PLANS ARE REALLY PICKING UP THE HOUSING SUITES SO IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A PATH FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PICK UP THOSE COMMUNITIES SUPPORTS WHERE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT PICKED UP TODAY- AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE FOR OUR COUNTY PARTNERS COUNTY PARTNERS CAN BE PROVIDERS OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. THEY CAN BE A PROVIDERS OF THE HOUSING SWEET SERVICES AND OFTENTIMES COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN HUGE LEADERS IN THIS SPACE AND THAT WE ARE HOPING THAT. THEY CAN PARTNER WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO BE COMMUNITY SUPPORT PROVIDERS SO THEY HAVE ALL OF THE TOOLS AT THEIR FINGERTIPS TO CONNECT ALL OF THESE RESOURCES. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY MUCH IN NEED. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE SPUR. POINT YOU HAD BROUGHT UP PASSED THE- PORTION OF TELLING. I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP WITH DR VERONICA KELLY WHO SAID THAT THERE'S NO HOUSING IF THEY'RE LEAVING. THE JAIL DUE TO THEM CURRENTLY BEING IN THE JAIL. THANK YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON HOW WE COULD REALLY WORK. WITH THIS POPULATION TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING HOUSING AFTER LEAVING INCARCERATION HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. FOUR SO ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OUR JUSTICE PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDES A NINETY DAY IN REACH WHILE SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN PRISONS JAILS FOR. A JUVENILE FACILITIES ON IN ONE OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THAT IS- BERRIES CASE MANAGER CAN P. M. COMPNENT AND LINKAGES TO OUR COMMUNITY SUPPORT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE NOW THIS WILL TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT WE'RE STILL NEGOTIATING- AND WE WOULD BE WILLING ON PHASES IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE. BUT THE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY GOOD CANDIDATES FOR THESE TYPES OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED SO WE ARE PROVIDING THOSE LINKAGES UPON RE ENTRY BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. BY THAT POINT WE'RE HOPING WE'LL HAVE MORE- PENETRATION OF THESE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF SO THAT IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US WE'RE ALSO LOOKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN CREATE WORK- JUSTICE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW I CONTINUE ON WITH THAT JUSTICE REENTRY PROPOSAL AS WELL LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH APPEARS WITH YOUR JUSTICE INVOLVED EXPERIENCE CAN BE PARTICIPATING IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE LINKAGES FOR INDIVIDUALS LEAVING INCARCERATION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING THOSE UP FRONT CONTINUE ONE ALSO THAT IS THE LONG TERM GOAL OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE- AND AS WE CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH CMS WILL BE HAPPY TO KEEP EVERYBODY APPRISED OF THOSE. DISCUSSIONS A FINAL QUESTION ON BRIDGE HOUSING AND- I WANT TO GET A SENSE ABOUT HOW WE COULD ENSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESOURCES ACROSS OUR STATE- WAS THERE GOING TO BE A PRIORITY. TO STATION- WOULD WE LOOK TOWARDS. AREA THAT- HAD MANY OF THE JAILS OR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING TO SPEND. THIS BRIDGE HOUSING FUNDING. JERRY ALL THE FOR TO YOU IN A TO WHAT OUR CURRENT THINKING IS ON THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THE BRIDGE HOUSING. I THINK I THINK TRYING TO BALANCE THE- GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY OR WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY IS A BOOKING AT OUR VEHICLE HEALTH ASSESSMENT TO HELP GUIDE US THROUGH. I THINK WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE USING THE MONEY EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE STATE AND I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS AT THIS TIME. WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I WILL NOW TRANSITION FOR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. AND FOCUS ON I. S. T. FOR MY NEXT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. SO I WILL I WILL BEGIN WITH- DIRECTOR CLINTON AND IF I CAN. I'M TRYING TO. JUST UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE INPUT. MIGHT- SO WHY HAPPENS WHEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER OR ANOTHER DEFENSE ATTORNEY BELIEVES THAT THEIR CLIENT MAY BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. WHO CURRENTLY PERFORMS THAT COMPETENCY EVALUATION. WHAT ARE THEIR CREDENTIALS AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THE COMPETENCY OF THESE PROFESSIONALS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL- IS ARRESTED ON AND IS- SUSPECTED OF BEING INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS THAT AND SOMEONE WHO WOULD RAISE THE DOUBT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE JUST A PUBLIC DEFENDER BUT- THE AT THE TECH HAPPENED THAT DOT WOULD BE REYES AND THEN THE COURT WOULD APPOINT A COURT APPOINTED AND- EVALUATOR USUALLY A PSYCHOLOGISTS- MORE PSYCHIATRISTS TO OPINE ON THE- INDIVIDUALS COMPETENCY STATUS- AND SO THEN AT THAT END OFIT DOT COMPETENCY REPORT IS COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BACK TO THE COURT- BE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO- AND I CANNOT REMEMBER THE STATUE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE WAS STATUTES THAT WHAT DID ASK- AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PRINT TO PRODUCE- STANDARDS. FOR COURT APPOINTED EVALUATORS- AND SO WE DID ISSUE REGULATIONS AROUND THOSE COURT APPOINTED EVALUATORS AND THEIR- THEIR RECOMMENDED TRAINING LEVELS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND EXPERIENCE LEVELS- BE. THAT IT DOES ALLOW IF THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE COURT IS UNABLE TO- I FIND SOMEONE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS TO STILL BE ABLE TO APPOINT AN EVALUATOR. SO THERE BUT THERE ARE EXISTING- GUIDELINES I GUESS IF YOU WELL ON WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE AND I DO HAVE- DIRECTOR AND DR WARBURTON WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE REGULATIONS- ON THE LINE FOR QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWERS THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THOSE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE. DR WARBURTON ARE YOU AVAILABLE YES I AM I REQUIREMENTS ARE- SORT OF MULTI LAYERED ANYTHING FROM REQUIRING- BOARD CERTIFICATION AND A FORENSIC SUBSPECIALTY FOR PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS OR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS OF TRAINING- IN THE ASSESSMENTS OF COMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL SO THEY WERE REALLY- TRAINING REQUIREMENTS- THAT WERE SUGGESTED IN RECOMMENDED. SO I HAVE A GOOD SENSE NOW OF WHO HELPED TO DETERMINE THAT BUT ONCE THE DEFENDANT NOW HAS BEEN DETERMINED. TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WHO THEN DETERMINES WHAT TYPE OF COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM OR FACILITY TO WHICH THE DEFENDANT WILL BE REFERRED IS THAT A COURT DECISION OR IS THAT SIMILARLY MADE BY THE PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST. SO AND SO ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL IS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THEN THE NEXT STEP IS THAT IT'S REFER TO THE COMMUNITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF OUR CONDITIONAL. RELEASE ACT GIVE ME CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND THAT COMMUNITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR THAN APPLIANCE ON WHETHER SOMEBODY AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR AND IS MORE SHOULD BE. CONSIDERED FOR A LOCKED FACILITY SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF LIKE THE DECISION OF LOCKED OR UNLOCKED AND THEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS- ARE THEN THE COURT WILL MAKE ANY- A RECOMMENDATION OR EXCUSE ME A COMMITMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT- OR TO THAT CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS CHOSEN FOR THAT CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM- ONCE INDIVIDUAL COMES TO THE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT- INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DIRECTED BY OUR PATIENT MANAGEMENT UNIT. INTO OUR STATE HOSPITALS OR INTO THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM AND THEN- WE ALSO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR DIVERSION PROGRAMS- RELATED TO IN DEMAND TO OFFER DIVERSION OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS. INDIVIDUALS CAN BEING REVIEWED BY THOSE PROGRAMS AS WELL TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHETHER SOMEONE MIGHT QUALIFY ù THE PLACEMENT IN ONE OF THEIR DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND THEN IF SOMEONE IS ABLE TO BEING PLACED IN A DIVERSION PROGRAM- THEN A PETITION WILL GO BACK TO THE COURT REQUESTING THAT PLACEMENT INTO INTO THE VERSION. AND THEN- SIMILARLY WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERSHIPS IN- IN LA THEY ALSO WILL PETITION THE COURT THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION LOCALLY WHETHER SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR ADS THERE ARE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM AND THEN PETITION THE COURT FOR THAT CASE MEANT A PLACEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY IS REALLY MORE OF A CONDITIONAL RELEASE IT IS CONSIDERED AN OUTPATIENT. PROGRAM AND SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK I FACTORED- PUBLIC STATE AND TO THE CLINICAL AND SO ULTIMATELY THAT THE COURT AND I AND HERE'S EVERYBODY'S PERSPECTIVES ON THAT BEFORE THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHETHER SOMEONE CAN BE SAFELY TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONRAD. THE PERSON WHO YOU WERE MENTIONING IS THAT A EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE OR IS THAT A COUNTY EMPLOYEE. I'M GONNA ACTUALLY US- CHANGING W. DIRECTOR EVEN TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT COMMUNITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR ROLE AND SHE'S USED TO SERVE AS OUR FORENSIC SERVICES. MORE INDEFINITELY ABOUT THAT ROLE. THANK YOU YEAH AS IT RELATES- AT ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION- THE CHAIR IS THAT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I. S. T. FOUND I. S. T. ON A FELONY CHARGE IF IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEING. WHO HAD- BEEN CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR THAT IS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTIES AND SO THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT PATHWAY IS INDIVIDUAL HAS THAT FELONY CHARGE THEN YES- AS AS IT RELATES TO CPD'S WILL EAT THAT APARTMENT ST HAN- STATE HOSPITALS DO CONTRACT WITH MULTIPLE PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND- AND WE HAVE SEVEN COUNTY PROVIDERS SO THERE ARE SEVEN COUNTIES. ACROSS OUR SYSTEM THAT DO PROVIDE THAT THAT SERVICE- BUT THE LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THE COUNTY IS TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES SO THE OTHER COUNTIES ARE COVERED BY PRIVATE PROVIDERS. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFF LINE BUT- REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THE INPUT TO IS IT THAT- AS WAS STATED THERE ARE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF I. S. T. PATIENTS BEING REFERRED IS THAT A FUNCTION OF THE- HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO'S MAKING THAT DETERMINATION OR IS IT CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITHIN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND SO I WILL. NEXT MOVE ON TO A COMPARISON THE RESTRAINTS CONSTRAINTS IF I CAN AS ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE TWENTY FOUR IT STATES THAT THAT'S REALLY THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THESE ONGOING BACKLOGS OF DEFENDANTS BOTH IN THE COUNTY JAILS AS WELL AS IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND ARE THESE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS. BEDS. OR STAFF OR BOTH. EIGHT I WILL TAKE THAT QUESTION IN SO REALLY WE HAVE IT- IS. A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH SO THE FIRST IS BEING IN THE REFERRALS HAVE BEEN INCREASING SO THE REFERRALS FROM THE COURT THIS WOULD BE IN THE REFERRALS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT. THEY DEEM SOMEBODY INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT BECOME AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR EVENS POINTED OUT- HE WAS CHARGED ON FELONY CHARGES. IS THAT COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SO THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS COMING FROM OUR COURTS HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE WE HAVE RESPONDED WITH A LOT OF CAPACITY INCREASES BUT- BASED ON THE LEVEL OF CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADDING. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAD ADDED OVER A THOUSAND BEDS TO TREAT THE INCREASING REFERRALS BUT WE STILL MAINTAIN THAT WEIGHT ONCE THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT- SOMEWHERE IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED MARK WHEN WE WENT INTO EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THE WAIT LIST WHEN WE WENT INTO THE PANDEMIC. BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY EXACERBATED THAT LAST. SO WE HAVE HAVE. DUE TO LIKE OUR CAPACITY AT THE STATE HOSPITALS IS BEEN REDUCED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE WE OPERATED OUT OF BACK OUT THAT'S A 9295% OCCUPANCY ALL OF OUR BEDS WERE PRETTY MUCH AN ACTIVATED AN OPEN ACROSS ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS AND OVER THE COURSE OF ALL THIS CAPACITY EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE I. S. TEASE. AND ADDS WE HAD TO IMPLEMENT IN INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES RELATED TO IT IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAD TO CREATE A MISSION OBSERVATION UNITS WE HAVE TO CREATE ISOLATION UNITS WE CONTACT. GREAT PLACES FOR TWO. PERSONS WHO ARE UNDER THE INVESTIGATION FOR KOBE I'M BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY LARGE DORM HOUSING UNITS WHICH IS VERY- OBVIOUSLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CODE IT IS VERY. VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE- IN THAT ENVIRONMENT TO MANAGE THE TRANSMISSION. SO IT OUR BEST DEFENSE IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE INDIVIDUALS AS THEY'RE COMING INTO OUR SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE COVERED BEFORE WE MOVE INTO A HOUSING UNITS WE HAD TO CREATE ALL THAT THESE THESE UNITS THAT WE DIDN'T. HAVE A VACANT WE HAD TO CREATE THOSE SPACES SO OUR CAPACITY HAS BEEN REDUCED- WITH RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT OF IDEAS TO USE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE- THE QUICK TURN- PATIENT COMMITMENT TYPES. THAT YOU KNOW WE JUST CHARGE PEOPLE QUITE FREQUENTLY SO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE WERE ABLE TO WE HAD TO HALT ADMISSIONS. AND THEN- CREATE THIS VACANT SPACE TO CREATE ALL THESE PANDEMIC. RESPONSE UNITS. MAYBE THEN I'LL LAST THE QUESTION DIRECT UP IT SEEMS THAT MOST OF OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON BEDS EVEN THIS YEAR WE HAVE TO EARN SIXTY SEVEN MILLION. AUTHORIZED TO HELP US WITH SOME ACUTE BED CAPACITY IN THE THOUSAND BEDS THAT YOU REFERENCED. WHERE ARE WE WITH STAFFING WAIT WHAT WHAT'S OUR VACANCY RATE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE STATE HOSPITALS FOR PROVIDERS TO HELP TO. PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ATTENTION TO HELP US TO TRY TO RESTORE COMPETENCY ARE WE EFFECTIVELY STAFFING UP AND HALF THE WORK FORCE- WITHIN OUR STATE HOSPITALS. TO ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF ICED. PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE A AND B. VACANCY RATES. WITH ME AT THE MOMENT BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH- VACANCY RATES WITH RESPECT TO OUR KIND OF CLINICAL AND POSITIONS- BUT GENERALLY- YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HARD TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SYSTEM GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN THE LOCATIONS OF THAT. THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS OF OUR STATE HOSPITAL SO WE'VE ALREADY HAD THOSE CHALLENGES- WE CERTAINLY MAINTAIN- AND BALANCE- I WOULD HAVE CIVIL SERVANTS BUT ALSO MAINTAIN REGISTRY CONTRACTS TO ASSIST US WHEN WE AREN'T ABLE TO MAKE- TO HIRE- ENOUGH CLINICIANS INTO CIVIL SERVICE- BUT WE CERTAINLY- HAVE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT IT- TO. THE CLINICAL POSITIONS ARE NURSING POSITIONS- CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE THAT PANDEMIC AS MANY- HEALTH- CARE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED AS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE AS A DEPARTMENT HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED TO BUILD OUR PIPE LINES INTO THAT INTO THE DEPARTMENT WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANY TRAINING INSTITUTIONS ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS MOST RECENTLY- THANK YOU TO THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH. RESIDENCY PROGRAM TO TRAIN INDIVIDUALS TO- TO TRAINED PSYCHIATRIST IN WITHIN OUR OWN INSTITUTION OVER AT NAPA STATE HOSPITAL AND JUST VERY QUICKLY WERE ABLE TO GET THAT PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING AND NOW HAVE OUR FIRST COHORT- THE- PSYCHIATRIST I'M IN TRAINING. SO AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THESE CHALLENGES THOSE ARE LONG STANDING CHALLENGES BUT ALWAYS WORKING TO EXPAND OUR PIPELINE PROGRAMS IN OUR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION EFFORTS. I WILL- A TO OCCUR. AND I HAD THIS MORNING SEVERAL OF THE PROVIDERS REGARDING VACANCIES THAT ARE AND MANY OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS ACROSS OUR STATE. THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS THIS HIGHEST T. ISSUE THAT HAS BOTH BEEN. VEXING AND HAVEN'T- COMPLICATED FOR US AS A STATE WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE FRONT LINE WORKERS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING THE APPROPRIATE- RESTORATIONS WHEN. WHEN APPLICABLE AND FOR US TO REACH THE TIME LINES AS MANDATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A NECESSARY CONVERSATION AND- FINALLY JUST FOR FINANCE I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING TO SCALE. THE FACT THAT WE'RE PUTTING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND RESIDENTIAL HOUSING AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION INTO AUTHORIZING SOME OF THESE. DSHS SUB ACUTE BED CAPACITY THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THEREAL UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH RETENTION AND OUR ABILITY TO KEEP MANY OF THESE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE SYSTEM- BY THE TIME WERE LOOKING TOWARDS CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES THERE MAY BE AN UNDERLYING ISSUE. WITH THE- OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE RESOURCE AND APPROPRIATELY TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE I. S. T. CONCERNS THAT MANY OF US HAVE. WITH THAT I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR. REGARDING FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND SO I WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND THEN I WILL TRANSFER. BIRD TO TOBY EWING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE NOW BEING FULLY UTILIZED. FOR R. I. S. T. POPULATION AT LEAST IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN DIVERSION PROGRAMS ARE THEY CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. AND IF NOT WHY NOT. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA ASK CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR EATON'S TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IS HER AND FORMER DIVISION WAS RESPONSIBLE AND FOR IMPLEMENTING DIVERSION ACROSS pINTIMATELY FOR KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM CLAIMS OF EACH OF THE DIVERSION PARTNERS. SURE THANK YOU- DEFINITELY WE DO ENCOURAGE ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS TO LOOK TO THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL TO UTILIZE AND IN SUPPORTING- PAPER VERSION PROGRAM. AND IN SOME OF OUR COUNTY PROGRAMS- THOSE- THAT THAT PROGRAMMING IS BEING- THIS IS SUPPORTING DIVERSION- BUT THE WAY THAT WE REALLY APPROACHED IT IS SORT OF CUSTOMISATION BASED ON WHERE THE COUNTY IS TRYING TO MEET THE COUNTY WHERE THEY WHERE THEY ARE- AND- THE SORT OF THE RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND SO. ON IN IN MANY RESPECTS SOME OF THE PROGRAMS DO LOOK A LOT LIKE A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP THE MAY NOT BE CALLED A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WHERE AS OTHER COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE UTILIZING IT SO IT'S NOT OFF THE TABLE IT'S NOT- EXCLUDED IT'S I THINK THAT WE CAN TACKLE- DAY VERSION AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO. IT'S BEEN OUR GOAL TO REALLY JUST WORK WITH EACH COUNTY TO. OR WHAT THOSE OPTIONS ARE WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND THEN AND THEN TARGET THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT. I WOULD POINT OUT AND I WILL NOW TRANSFER TO TOBY EWING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY NINE AND THE AGENDA. IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND IT DESCRIBES IT AS THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED OR AT RISK OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HENCE WHY I REALLY AM LOOKING TOWARDS FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH DURING THIS LAST YEAR RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RESOURCES DUE TO OUR TOP EARNERS DOING WELL THAT I'D LIKE TO ENSURE THAT OUR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE SIMILARLY- PROVIDING NEEDED RESOURCES FOR I S. T. POPULATION AS WE HEARD FROM OUR E. R. DR. THERE ARE HIGH UTILIZED HERS OR FREQUENT FLYERS AND- BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DIRECT THOSE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND. FROM TOBY IF I CAN. THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ARE A COUNTIES NOW WHO ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AND REFINING THEIR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. WHAT METRICS ARE THEY CURRENTLY USING AND WHAT IS THE TIMING OF THESE EVALUATIONS AND FINALLY DO COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THAT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION TO THE I. S. T. PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TOBY DOING ON BEHALF MENTAL COMMISSION- I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR QUESTION RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WITH A SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD YES OR NO. FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE ORIGINS OF THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP WHICH WAS A PILOT OUT OF LONG BEACH TO- TO TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND SERVE THEM IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE MODEL IS CALLED A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP FIRST BECAUSE IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PROVIDER AND THE INDIVIDUAL THE MENTAL HEALTH HERE. AND IT'S FULL SERVICE BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE PROVIDER TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT IN THE IN THE GOALS HISTORICALLY. HAVE BEEN TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION INCARCERATION AND HOMELESSNESS. SO THE MODEL IS QUITE ELEGANT ITS IT'S- COMPREHENSIVE. WE HAVE WE HAVE A B. C. P. IN FRONT OF YOU NOW- SO WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW COUNTIES USING THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL. THE REASON YOUR QUESTION IS COMPLICATED ANSWER QUESTIONS COMPLICATED IS BECAUSE- FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS ARE TYPICALLY FIND WITH AN HSA FUNDS IN THERE RE PRO HAVE BISSCHEN TIME USING IMAGES SAY FUNDS. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NON VOLUNTARY SCENARIOS AND SO THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THE NATURE OF DIVERSION AND SOMEONE WHO MAY BE UNDER A COURT ORDER- HAVING BEEN DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. I THINK THE IMPORTANT LESSON HERE ISN'T THE SOURCE OF FUNDING. IT MAY BE THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FLEXIBLE CAN BE USED WELL BEYOND WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH MANTA CAL- BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE MODEL. HOW CAN WE DESIGN SYSTEMS HOW DO WE DESIGN THE CAPACITY TO LEARN FROM THE STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS IN A WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE DON'T DO THAT WORK THERE'S A FAR HIGHER PERSONAL FAMILY COMMUNITY AND FISCAL COST. WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY END UP IN THE STATE HOSPITAL RETURNING TO A STATE HOSPITAL. FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY WE COME TO YOU WITH THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. TO REALLY BETTER UNDERSTAND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THE KINDS OF METRICS THAT ARE BEING USED THE DATA THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED- THE PILOT THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS IT WAS A SMALL PILOT WITH A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES. REALLY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CAPACITY TO BE OUTCOME FOCUSED IN THEIR CONTRACTING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND SO WE SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THAT WORK TO EXPLORE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING AND THEN TO SAY. EVEN IF WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THEM AND JUST SAY FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THIS WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH. HOW CAN THE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE F. S. P. COMPONENT AT THE MHSAA REALLY BEGIN TO DRIVE STREET. DRIVE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT THE HOMELESSNESS THAT IS LEADING TO THE LARGE NUMBERS OF FOLKS LANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DEPARTMENT TATE HOSPITALS. SO THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU IS WE'RE STILL WORKING TO FIGURE THAT OUT WE WANT TO SEPARATE OUT THE PROGRAMMATIC. SIDE A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE FUNDING SIDE SO THAT THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE MHSAA CAN EXPAND INTO FOR EXAMPLE HOW WE MIGHT USE MEDICARE FUNDING. HOW WE CAN USE OTHER SOURCES OF DOLLARS AS WELL AND HOW THE STATE MIGHT DO. MORE UPSTREAM WORKS THAT WE CAN REDUCE DEMANDS ON OUR STATE HOUSE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM NOT WE WILL FOLLOW UP MORE IN. THE FINAL QUESTION MAYBE RHETORICAL BUT I DO FEEL IT NEEDS TO BE ASK I WAS REALLY. MOVED BYSANDRA- CITING BERG'S. TESTIMONY THAT THAT'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION OR STATE HOSPITAL. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT HAPPENED A SANDERS COUSIN DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THANK YOU YES AND THE- A COUPLE OF THINGS TO MENTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT PROCESS- OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T- SAYING- MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION CAN'T SPEAK SPECIFIC TO ANY SPECIFIC- SITUATION BUT JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PROCESS AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS WELL AS- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT AND IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ADMIT AND INDIVIDUAL AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WE FIRST HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A COMMITMENT BY THE COURT. AND THAT PROCESS STARTS BY- WE HAVE AN ELECTRONIC PROCESS WHERE THE COURT UPLOADS A COMMITMENT PACKET AND THEN THE MINUTE WE GET THAT COMMITMENT PACKET- NOT SAME DAY THERE AT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS THEN ADDED TO OUR WAIT LIST SO WHATEVER TIME IT TAKES FOR A COURT TO- SUBMIT A PACKET TO THE DEPARTMENT THERE THERE CAN BE DELAYS AND THAT CAN- DILUTE FURTHER DELAY BEYOND JUST WHAT TIME IT TAKES FOR MEN AND BETUL WHO IS COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT TO WHEN WE HAVE A BAD THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM- THAT CAN FURTHER ADD TIME TO THAT. ADMISSION TIMELINE- THERE ARE INSTANCES OCCASIONALLY WHERE WE LEARN THAT TO ANY COURT HAS NOT SUBMITTED A COMMITMENT PACKET OFTEN- WHEN NOT WHEN OFTEN BUT IT DOES HAPPEN IT'S USUALLY WE ARE NOTIFIED THROUGH THE COURT FOLLOWING UP ON THE STATUS OF A MISSION OR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS- REQUESTED- AND- ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AS TO WHY SOMEBODY HASN'T BEEN ADMITTED- SO THERE ARE CASES WHERE AID PACKAGE THE COURT DOES NOT UPLOAD A PACKET AND THAT'S HOW WE FIND OUT. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A REPORT ON THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE COUNTIES SO THAT THEY CAN DO A RECONCILIATION WITH OUR WAIT LIST- WE'RE CURRENTLY PILOTING NOT WITH SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND THEN AS WE WORK OUT THAT IS- CAN IT'S THAT LITTLE- AT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ROLL OUT SO WIDELY WILL ALLOW THAT COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WHO'S ON THE WAY AT LAST AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE COMMITMENT PACKETS FOR EVERYBODY THAT THEY ARE TRACKING AND SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THAT DEPARTMENT AND THEN ONE SECOND WE HAVE A COMMITMENT ALL OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE WORKING ON TODAY THAT WE PROPOSED- AND PROVIDED UPDATES ON TODAY THOSE ARE ALL DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO GET TREATMENT WITHIN THE TWENTY EIGHT DAYS I GET STARTED ON SUBSTANTIVE TREATMENT WITHIN THE TWENTY DAYS THAT IS BEEN. REQUIRED BY THE STATE OF ANY OF THE COURT IN THE CITY OF ANY CASE. I APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS AND SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE SECOND PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE. ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM.

AND I WILL BE I'M CONCLUDING MY REMARKS WILL BE THE ONLY PERFECT PRESENTER FOR DH YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DR VERONICA KELLY CHIEF OF MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOVERY SERVICES ORANGE COUNTY PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN I THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO CAN BE RECALLED DIRECTORS ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S ALLOCATION OF TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS YEAR'S BUDGET AND EXCITED TO START SPENDING DOWN THESE FUNDS TO MAKE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ONE HISTORICALLY BECAUSE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT HAS BEEN CAPPED AT COSTS. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE ABILITY TO BUILD A RESERVE OR PROFIT INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT LIKE OTHER PARTS OF HEALTH CARE WE'VE HAD A FEW FUNDS EARMARKED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE REALLY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED TO BUILD UP ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS COMMISSIONED A RAND STUDY INPATIENT BED CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WHAT WE FOUND ALIGNS CLOSELY WITH THE STATE'S GAPS ANALYSIS BUT PAINS AND MORE NUANCED PICTURE. FIRST WE NEED TO LOOK AT THROUGHPUT BECAUSE OF BOTTLENECKS AT THE SUBACUTE AND RESIDENTIAL LEVELS CAN CAN IMPACT A PATH TO THEIR HIGHER LEVELS SECOND WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE HAVE ROUGHLY 65% OF THE NEEDED CAPACITY ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF ACUTE CARE FOR ADULTS. AND ONLY 57% OF NEEDED RESIDENTIAL LEVELS OF CARE AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INPATIENT UNITS IN GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS. THE REMAINDER OF THE CUTE AND RESIDENTIAL CARE LARGELY FALLS UNDER THE IMD EXCLUSION HAVING OVER SIXTEEN BADS AND THEREFORE IS ENTIRELY FUNDED WITH NO MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF THE COUNTY PICKS THAT. ARE MOST SEVERELY IMPACTED. REGIONS OF THE STATE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. RETICULAR AND THIS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY LACKS A- AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING NEED. LEAVE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT CAN PAY OFF IF IT IS DONE RIGHT AND WE URGE THE STATE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING ON THESE ANALYSES. TO FURTHER STUDY GAPS IN THE CHILDREN'S CONTINUUM OF CARE AS WELL AS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. THE STATE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER DELAYING ITS FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S CAPACITY FOR EXAMPLE UNTIL IT HAS A SIMILARLY RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL NEEDS IN THE CHILDREN'S SYSTEM OF CARE WHICH IS FAR MORE COMPLEX. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO FOUND THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES- ARE UNIQUE TO THE TYPE OF CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE WITH FINDING PLACEMENTS IN HE EXISTING. DELIVERY SYSTEM SO POPULATIONS SUCH AS PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS LIKE OUR CENTER SEX OFFENSES. AND MEDICAL COMORBIDITIES LIKE CARPET OR GENETIC BRAIN INJURY HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING PRESS THE PLACE AND SALMON DINO COUNTY WE WERE FACED WITH FINDING PLACEMENT FOR A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN. DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDER WHO WAS A SEX OFFENDER AND AN ARSONIST AND WHO IS NOW EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS OF DEMENTIA. JUST ONE OF THOSE COMORBIDITIES AS A CHALLENGE BUT ALL FOR IN AN ELDER. NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTEND TO BUT WE DID. WE NEED TO SOLVE NOT ONLY FOR NUMBERS OF BEDS BUT FOR THE IN THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE BATS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NON AMBULATORY. PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF. ANYONE WITH AN ASSAULTIVE HISTORY. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PEOPLE TO PLACE AND THEY ARE OFTEN THE MOST IN NEED OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. CANADA ALREADY APPLYING VIA THE PROCESS OF FINDING A NEED TO BE CHECKED IN ORANGE COUNTY WE ARE POISED TO SUBMIT ONE COUNTY PROJECT TO ADD CSU. CAPACITY IN A REGION THAT HAS NOT FOR ADULTS AND YOUTH PLUS FOUR LEVELS OF S. U. D. AND RESIDENTIAL. AND WE HAVE TO CREATE A BASE PRINTER BASED- PROJECTS TO EXPAND S. U. D. RESIDENTIAL CONQUERING CARE AND BOARDING CARE. FOR FORENSIC POPULATIONS. HOWEVER THESE DOLLARS ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE COMPETITIVE GRANT STRUCTURE. THIRTY YEAR SERVICE COMMITMENT AND REQUIRE 10% MATCH CASH OR LAND. ADD UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY AND BARRIERS FOR MANY COUNTIES. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS FOR THE PAST YEAR HAVING GOOD FOTUNE TO HAVE RESOURCES LIKE SHOVEL READY LAND. BUT NOT ALL COUNTIES ARE IN THIS POSITION ALTHOUGH ALL COUNTIES NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT COUNTIES WILL NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND OUR CONTINUUM. BEYOND BRICKS AND MORTAR INVESTMENTS WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EXPAND SERVICES NOT JUST BAD AND TO RECOUP TO RE RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KIM PETERSON SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR AGAIN MY NAME IS KIM PETERSON FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA MY COMMENTS RELATED TO BE CHECK FOCUS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT DH CS HAS TO FOCUS ON INVESTMENTS IN COMPREHENSIVE UPSTREAM SERVICES AND THE ROUNDS OF CRISIS RESPONSE AND TREATMENTS. FOR MORE WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE DRC HAS SEEN HOW MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ALMOST UNIFORMLY RESULTS AND PLACEMENT OF A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD WHEN A CALL FOR HELP IS MADE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE STATE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE OVERWHELMINGLY DOES NOT SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE LESS RESTRICTIVE OPTIONS. THIS RESULT IN STRAIN ON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS BACKLOGS OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR LIMITED INPATIENT BEDS AND UNTOLD TRAUMA FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES TAINT. TRAVERSE THIS TREND WE ENCOURAGE DH CS TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF PROJECTS WHEN CHOOSING HOW TO AWARD ITS SPEECH AT FUNDING. CURRENTLY EACH OF THESE PARTS OF THE CONTINUE- ARE NOT OFFERED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ACCORDING TO THE RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IF EXPANDED THESE SERVICES CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVES TO INVOLUNTARY HOLDS AN ACUTE HOSPITALIZATIONS. FIRST DH CS AND INVEST HEAVILY IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED CARE SUPPORT AND SERVICES. SECOND IN ADDITION TO THE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE TRIP IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DH CS TO BUILD OUT THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO PROVIDE A ROBUST ARAM CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES. THESE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE BRIEF INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO QUICKLY RESOLVE THE CRISIS WHEN APPROPRIATE. CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN LOCATIONS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH URGENT CARE CENTERS WALK IN CENTRES CARE RESPITE AND SOBERING CENTERS. THIRD DH CS SHOULD USE THECHIP FUNDS TO EXPAND THE STATE'S CAPACITY FOR CRISIS TREATMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CRISIS STABILIZATION SERVICES. THIS COULD INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT LICENSE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS AND EXPANSION OF CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE USED AS ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITALIZATION. LASTLY THE NCS PRIORITIZE B. EIGHT B. CHIP INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UNDER DEVELOPED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OUR WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE DRC YOU SEE IS THAT GEOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICESIS NOT EQUAL. IN ADDITION TO YOUR SEATS ARE JUST BEACH HAPPEN BASS MEANT TO FOCUS ON PROJECTS THAT WILL SERVE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC POPULATIONS AS WELL SPECIAL POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND PEOPLE WITH CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A PANEL. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR LEE ANDREA CLARK HARVEY THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE PROVIDED SOME EXCELLENT COMMENTS ALREADY ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THIS PROPOSAL AND CV HA ALSO APPLAUDS THE EFFORTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCLUDE MANY VOICES IN THEIR ASSESSMENT AND ALSO CREATE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO DIVERSE PROVIDERS. TO PROMOTE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION WHILE ALSO PROMOTING THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DUAL DIAGNOSES TO HEAL AND PLACE IN A LEASE FOR STOCK RESTRICTIVE COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHENEVER POSSIBLE BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON CARE INTEGRATION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY REMARKS AND ALL SHARE A QUICK ILLUSTRATION FROM MY EXPERIENCES AS A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF POOR CLINICAL INTEGRATION WHEN I PRACTICE THAT I COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER IN ANOTHER STATE SOMETHING THAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS WERE PHYSICALLY LOCATED ON DIFFERENT FLOORS OF THE BUILDING. PROVIDERS DID NOT TRAIN TOGETHER THEY DIDN'T WORK ON CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION EXCEPT TRY AND WHY WELL MOSTLY BECAUSE OF DESPERATE FUNDING SITE LEVELS. IT WAS HARDLY A WHOLE PERSON CARE IT WAS SEGMENTED CARE AND CLIENTS KNEW WHO WAS GETTING WHAT TYPE OF TREATMENT JUST BASED ON THE WHICH FLOOR THEY GOT OFF ON THE ELEVATOR. YEARS LATER WHEN I STARTED PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES WE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ON AN INTERDISCIPLINARY MODEL AND THAT'S WHERE MY BEST CLINICAL WORK WITH DYING EVERY SPECIALTY AT THE TABLE COMBINING AND LEVERAGING EXPERTISE THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT. SO INTEGRATING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SHOULD NO LONGER BE AN OPTIONAL MODEL OR FRAMEWORK OR HOW TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED IT NEEDS TO BE IMPERATIVE COMMONPLACE AND CBJ HOPEFUL ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK OUTLINED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL REALLY HELP US MOVE TOWARDS INTEGRATION QUICKLY. IT ALL STARTS WITH BREAKING FUNDING SILOS. DOWN TO TRULY HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SINCE THAT WORKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TYLER REALTY WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR PAMBULA MEMBERS TYLER IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CASH HE CAN BE AS MEMBERSHIP IS EXCITED ABOUT THE DEDICATION OF THE STATE AND TO PAY FOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND FOR STRUCTURE IS UNPRECEDENTED. HOWEVER SO IS THE LEVEL OF NEED TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE SUBMITTED THE STATE FOR FUNDING AND WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY DIRECTLY AS PROVIDERS FOR THE FUNDING. WE HAVE A PROVIDER WHO IS PURCHASING AND RENOVATING A BUILDING FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM AND SO NOW MY COUNTY THEY HAD A CURRENT PROGRAM THAT THE LONG TERM LEASE EXPIRED AND SO THIS IS EXPAND ALLOWING THEM TO. GO INTO ANOTHER FACILITY AND BE ABLE TO EXPAND ON SERVICE SAYS HAVE A NEWS SIXTY BAD THAT NEW CONSTRUCTION RESIDENTIAL PROJECT IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA OF LOS ANGELES WITH AN ATTACHED ON SIXTEEN BADS UPPER COPPERY BRIDGE HOUSING. AND THAT IT WILL BE IN AN EXISTING TWENTY BAD WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROGRAM TO A NEW BUILDING AND EXPANDING BADS TO AT LEAST FIFTY AND THEN A SECOND PROJECT FROM THE SAME PROVIDER THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BUILD A SMALL OUTPATIENT FACILITY TO A LARGER LOCATION. AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND SERVICE SAYS THESE PROGRAMS AND TYPES OF PROJECTS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. I'M BUILDING OUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES WILL ALSO ALLOW CARE TRANSITIONS TO BE- TAKE PLACE MORE SERIOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S HOSPITALIZED FOR AN OVERDOSE MOTIVATED TO RECEIVE TREATMENT BY THE EXPERIENCE TRANSITIONING DIRECTLY INTO RESIDENTIAL CARE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CALL HOME FIRST WHILE THEY WAIT FOR A PATH. WHERE WE KNOW THAT IN THAT SITUATION MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE RISK OF A RELAPSE. I PREVIOUSLY RAISED THIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT WE HOPE TO SEE THAT THERE IS EQUITABLE FUNDING PROJECTS BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NATIONALLY FORTY ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS HAVE. THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ACCORDING TO THE RECENT DATA FROM THE NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND- HOWEVER MY THAN 10% OF. EACH YEAR OR OLDER RECEIVED AN INCREASE FOR THEIR- USE DISORDER. THERE STILL EXIST SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN AVAILABILITY AND- INSPECT MY PETS AS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE. I'M THE BIGGEST BARRIER OUT TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE. AND THE NEED TO FIND ONGOING SERVICES WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. WE ALSO WOULD NOTE THE CRITICAL ON HOW CRITICAL- IMPLEMENTATION OF PAYMENT REFORM AND DOCUMENTATION REFORM UNDER COUNTY IS TO FULLY UTILIZE DOT POTENTIAL SERVICES AND- FACILITIES. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- SET THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRESENTERS I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR I WILL BEGIN MY QUESTIONS WITH DH CS. I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT I'M I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ABLE TO HELP TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO RESPOND TO BOTH PSYCHOSIS. AS WELL AS FOR THE ALL CODE YOU'D DROP IN CENTERS. AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD LAST WEEK I ASKED IF- THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS A BENEFICIARY OF THIS FUNDING THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THE ANSWER WAS NOT YET. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE INVESTED FIFTEEN MILLION TO SUPPORT ALTHOUGH IF YOU DROP IN CENTERS. AND TWENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT THE COORDINATED SPECIALTY CARE. FOR PSYCHOSIS AND THIS YEAR WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. THAT I'D LIKE TO TRY TO GET IN UNDERSTAND SINCE WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER SUPPORT THAT INVESTMENT THROUGH THIS. INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING CAN YOU CLARIFY IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AND WHAT OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT INCENTIVIZE. THE USE OF THESE BONDS SO THAT WE CAN FURTHER THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE ALREADY MADE ELIGIBLE- AND ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS- FACILITY TYPE FOR OUR AT OUR BROWN RELATED TO- CHILDREN ANYTHING EVER HEALTH- INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND SIMILARLY- THE FIRST LYCOS'S PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES THAT ADDRESS THOSE THOSE CONCERNS ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN IN THESE GRANT PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I- WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE EARLY RESULTS WE'VE SEEN FROM EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND THE- PULKOVO DROP IN MODELS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WERE- INCREASING- BUILDING THOSE OUT IF POSSIBLE- I WOULD NOTE OKAY START. MARCH THIRTY FIRST WE HAVE OUR FIRST LISTENING SESSION ON THAT ON THAT ROUND DEFINING AND SO- JUST. WELCOME THEIR PARTICIPATION IN NOT LISTENING SESSION AS WELL. WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP NOW IT'S A DRAW MIGHT CONSISTENTLY BEAT BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM MONEY IS BEING EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND DO PRIOR ROUNDS OF FUNDING INFORM FUTURE ROUNDS IN TERMS OF WHO THE RECIPIENTS HAVE BEEN AND WHAT STATE GOALS HAVE OR HAVE NOT BEEN. A REACHED HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. SURE SO AT THAT THE PRE ROUND BEEN THREE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND I THINK AS WE LEARNED- WHAT. PROJECTS HAVE BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE EARLIER ROUNDS I THINK THAT MY TO JUST HOW WE I WORKED AROUND FIVE AND SIX IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE FURTHER GAPS-% THAT WE IDENTIFY THINKING WE WANT TO YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR FIRST INITIAL KIND OF GIGI GEOGRAPHIC DISINTEGRATION AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH IN FUTURE ROUNDS ADJUSTING BASED ON. YOU KNOW WHAT PROJECTS ARE AWARDED WHAT GAPS DO ANYTHING STILL NEED TO BE FILLED AND REALLY RECOGNIZING WE WANT THESE DOLLARS TO GO ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS YOUR WORLD URBAN AND ALL THE DIFFERENT A REGIONAL KIND OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT MIGHT. MIGHT FACTOR IN AS WELL. EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND WAS WONDERING IF IT HAD IDENTIFIED. A SPECIFIC COST FOR COVERING ALL OF THE STATE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. IF SO HOW MUCH IS IT. AND HOW CLOSELY ALIGNED IS IT TO THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET COST IN TERMS OFWHAT IT WHAT AND ASSESSMENT THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WE ALSO HAVE THE WORK THAT WE WILL BE DOING REGARD OUR TO OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN. I AM I AM THE WAY PERSONAL ALL OF THESE PIECES TOGETHER I'M REALLY ARE GOING TO HELP US BUILD OUT THE CONTINUUM. ACROSS THE STATE. FINAL QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT TYLER RANDY. HAD MENTIONED ABOUT ENSURING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. HOPING YOU COULD. PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON ON THE QUESTION. THAT QUESTION I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MERRILEES BUT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT BEING MISTER READY FOR REALLY JUST GOING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES THAT REALLY KIND OF IT REALLY THAT THAT IS JUST CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF WHAT THESE DOLLARS CAN PROVIDE AND WHAT SERVICES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT AND KIND OF- AND- GROSSO- ARE LEAST CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION YEAH DEFINITELY SO- OUTWARD LOOKING AT MAKING THESE AWARDS AND- SHELLER DIMENSION BROWN THREE IS CURRENTLY OUT AND FOR FUTURE ROUNDS. AS WELL I WILL BE LOOKING AT. NOT ONLY. AND LIKE THE- MENTIONED BUT ALSO FOR SUBSTANCE USE HEALTH ALSO. INNOVATIVE TO SELL THESE HAT ARE DOING CO OCCURRING. ON OR MAYBE SERVING YOU KNOW SPECIAL POPULATIONS ARE JUST JUST INVOLVED. I'M SO WE HAVE SET UP OUR STATE PRIORITIES- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE THIRD PANEL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FOURTH PANEL ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE FOR PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS. WE WILL HAVE EIGHT SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH DR SETH THOMAS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND DIRECTOR OF QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE. AT FERTILITY PLEASE BEGIN DR THOMAS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND GOOD EVENING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING MY TESTIMONY I'M DOCTOR SET THOMAS I AM AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND AMID RECTOR QUALITY PERFORMANCE OF FOUR BY TWO WEEKS. I WORKED CLINICALLY AT MERCY SAN JUAN MEDICAL CENTER IN I'M JOINED THIS EVENING. BY DR MICHAEL COURT PEEL WHO IS OUR HOSPITAL CEO AND PRESIDENT WHO WILL ALSO BE TELLING US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE M. POP BOTTLE. BUT BEFORE I START TIME WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE GAPS IN CARE FOR PATIENTS IN CRISIS IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND I ALWAYS LEARNED EARLY ON. IN MY LEADERSHIP CAREER WHEN YOU BRING A PROBLEM TO SOMEBODY TO HELP THEM SOLVE IT DON'T JUST BRING THE PROBLEM BUT BRING SOLUTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY. WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DM HOUSE MODEL OR EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT. AND TREATMENT AND HEALING MODEL SO AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME HIS ACCESS TO CARE MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF YOUR ABILITY TO PAY AND YOUR BACKGROUND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE TREATMENT. I ALSO BELIEVE IN QUALITY COMPASSIONATE CARE GIVING PATIENTS THE RIGHT TREATMENT AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT PLACE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PATIENT AND DOINGWHAT'S BEST BUT I ALSO REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS MAXIMIZING THROUGHPUT. AND REDUCING DELAYS FOR THESE PATIENTS ALSO STEWARDSHIP THE APPROPRIATE USE OF RESOURCES AND ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY WASTE AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I SEE THIS ON A DAY IN AND DAY OUT BASIS WHERE PATIENTS COME TO US. IN CRISIS PATIENTS ARE HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT PATIENTS SHOULD COME TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BUT THEY SHOULDN'T STAY THERE INDEFINITELY AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENT DAYS ON END WITHOUT TREATMENT. SO WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A SOLUTION SOMETHING THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED AT MERCY ST ONE BECAUSE CENTER. AND IT IS CALLED THE EMPOWER MODEL WE HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR FUNDING OF THAT KIND OF A MODEL. BEFORE THE END PASSED MODEL. WE WOULD ASSESS PATIENTS AND THEY WOULD GO THREE VERY STRINGENT LINEAR PROCESS OF MEDICAL EVALUATION BEEN BEING EVALUATED BY SOCIAL WORKERS ARE CRISIS WORKERS TO EVENTUALLY GET INTO INPATIENT UNIT. THAT PROCESS WOULD TAKE ONE TO TWO DAYS. AFTER THIS AND HALF MODEL PROVIDING CRISIS INTERVENTION CRISIS TREATMENT WE NOW HAVE CHOICES WE CAN RESTRICT FIVE PATIENTS INITIATE TREATMENT QUICKLY AND GET THEM THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IMMEDIATELY. NOT EVERY PATIENT NEEDS TO GO TO AN INPATIENT FACILITY FOR STABILIZING CARE. YEP HAVE MODEL IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN EXTERNALLY VALIDATED CHU. BY IMPLEMENTING IMPACT MODELS YOU CAN REDUCE THE E. LANCASTER BY OVER 70% GETTING PATIENTS THE CARE THAT THEY TRULY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST. IT REDUCES INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSIONS BY OVER FIFTY PERCENT. REDUCING RECIDIVISM BY 25% AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT PATIENTS ARE GETTING CONNECTED TO THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS AND THE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. BY MORE THAN 60% MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY. AND IT ALSO REDUCES THE LENGTH OF STAY FOR INPATIENT HOSPITALS AS WELL. NOW MICHAEL'S GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE AT MERCY SAN JUAN MEDICAL CENTER. THANKS DR THOMAS- WE WERE AWARDED AN INNOVATION GRANT THROUGH THE STATE. OUGHT TO OPEN UP OUR- CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT AND THERE'S A PICTURE OF IT ON THE FAR RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE. YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT YOUR EMERGENCY ROOMS TYPE SETTING AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR. OUR BEHAVIOR HELP PATIENTS WE HAVE SEEN THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS SINCE ITS INCEPTION. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. OUR AND OUR STATISTICS MERE WHAT DR THOMAS HAS RECORDED IN THE PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES 75% ARE DISCHARGED HOME. 30% REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATE R. ET BOARDING TIME. HAS GONE FROM THIRTY TWO POINT NINE HOURS DOWN TO FOUR POINT FIVE HOURS THIS FALL. I AND OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE SCORES ARE QUITE HIGH AT THE EIGHTY SIXTH PERCENTILE. OF MERCY SAN JUAN HAS DEVELOPED A TRANSFER AGREEMENTS WITH ALL OF THE FACILITIES IN. SACRAMENTO TO HELP ALL PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. THIS IS OUR CURRENT- PAYER MIX AND YOU. CAN SEE VERY HEAVY META CAL. IN POPULATION BUT- THAT'S WITH THIS UNIT HAS- DESIGNED TO- SERVE. AND THEN FINALLY SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE CLEAR LICENSING GUIDELINES FOR ALL COUNTIES AND SEE CDPH TO FOLLOW. A MEDIC CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT MAKE THE SERVICE FINANCIALLY VIABLE AND THEN CONTINUED USE OF INNOVATION DOLLARS TO GET SEE ISSUES UP AND RUNNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR AMY MULAN WHO'S AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AT UC DAVIS PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE TIME AND ENERGY AND CREATIVITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING- AND THE ATTENTION ON OUR PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE WHAT WE HEARD FROM DOCTOR THOMAS THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WE ARE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE WHO MEET THEM AND DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. RATHER THAN CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE WHICH IS DESIGNED THE SYSTEM TO DRIVE PEOPLE THROUGH IT- WE KNOW THAT. THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. IS JUST INCREASING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE INCREASES IN EIGHTY VISITS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE. AND WE WERE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN EDIE VISITS. BECAUSE OF OUR SHARED TRAUMA AND AS WE RECOVER FROM KOBE NINETEEN. AND I THINK IT'S A FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IT'S HARD RATE WE WANT TO THINK OF AN EASY VISIT IT'S A FAILURE AND WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT US- AND WE BLAME PEOPLE FOR GOING TO THE WRONG PLACE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DESIGNED. AND INSTEAD WE SHOULD BEGIN WITH OUR DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF EACH PERSON AND FROM WHAT I HEAR ABOUT THIS- HALF SYSTEM. WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS EXACTLY THIS IS TO BRING THE RESOURCES TO THE PATIENT RATHER THAN TAKING THE PATIENT TO THE RESOURCE. WERE EVERYWHERE SOMEONE ASKS FOR HELP WE NEED TO BE THERE AND GIVE THEM THE HELP THAT TEY NEED. EVERY HEALTH CARE COME IN COUNTER EVERY EDIE VISIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER AND GIVE PEOPLE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AND SO I SWEAR LIKE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP OUR THINK ABOUT HOW TO BRING THESE RESOURCES. SUCH AS PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST COUNSELLORS MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM- AND SO THAT IS EXACTLY THIS THE SYSTEM THAT DR THOMAS DESCRIBED. AND WE KNOW WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE THERE OFTEN IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. WAITING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED- BECAUSE WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. FROM THESE REIMBURSEMENT AND BILLING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE NEED AND SO I THINK. IF WE ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO SIR. AND DESIGN THE SYSTEM FOR THEM RATHER THAN FROM THEN FOR US WE START TO UNDERSTAND. THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE- BECAUSE IT IS JUST SO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE THESE RESOURCES WHERE. THEY NEED THEM WHEN THEY NEED THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR MULLIN NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM RENO HACK A PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST. AT UC DAVIS PLEASE BEGIN OR- HI MY NAME IS SERENA HOCH UM I MAP YOUR SUPPORT SPECIALIST AT THE UC DAVIS EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM- I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH- AS A CHRONIC DISORDER FOR ABOUT A DECADE- AND I'VE BEEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM- FORD PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES ARM PROBABLY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES- I NO LONGER GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IF I NEED HELP BECAUSE I FOUND- MERGING. THE ROOMS TO BE INCREDIBLY UNHELPFUL. I'M IN GENERAL MY EXPERIENCE IS BANNED I GO THERE I WAIT FOR. LIKE BARE MINIMUM FIVE HOURS I AM IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN DISTRESS I'M INTELLIGENCE TEAM BY A SOCIAL WORKER OR PSYCHIATRIST AND THEN THE TWO OUTCOME BAND EITHER I'M HOSPITALIZED OR I AM DISCHARGED. AND WHEN IT GETS CHARGED I AM GIVING NO RESOURCES MAY. BE A SHORT TERM PRESCRIPTION. AND THIS HAS BECAUSE MY MENTAL HEALTH CRISES TO BE SO MUCH MORE- PROLONGED THEN THEY NEED TO BE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THEY JUST KNOW- I MEAN CRISIS I'M GOING TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM- THAT. THERE'S BEEN SO MANY TIMES I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN CRISIS BUT I DIDN'T MEET THE GUIDELINES FOR HOSPITALIZATION. SO FOR SOME REASON THAT MEANT THAT THEY COULDN'T HELP ME- THERE'S SO MANY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA FOR HOSPITALIZATION- AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SERVICES I BENEFITTED FROM THE HEART OF HOSPITALIZATION BUT I NEVER KNEW ABOUT. AND I FEEL LIKE AS LONG AS THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS IT IS. IT'S NOT DOING ITS JOB AND THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS GOING TO REMAIN THE WRONG PLACE FOR PEOPLE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SET UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO BE CONNECTED TO OTHER RESOURCES. BESIDES FOSSILIZATION THERE'S SO MANY SERVICES THIRD ARTICLE PUBLICATION PROGRAMS THERE'S AN- INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES THIRDS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS. AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO THESE RESOURCES. I AM. EARLY ON IN THEIR JOURNEY THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THESE SERVICES EXIST OR HOW TO GET THERE AND A LOT OF TIMES THEIR FIRST CONTACT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH. SYSTEM IS THE EMERGENCY ROOM- AND HOSPITALIZATION THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE LIKE THE PROGRAM I TALKING. ARE OFTEN A LOT CHEAPER DISCHARGED WITH NOTHING AND BAY CONTINUE ONE BEING A CRISIS UNTIL A COUPLE MONTHS LATER THEY MEET CRITERIA FOR HOSPITALIZATION NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY HELP. YOU KNOW- ALONG THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES ARE DRAMATIC OR CONSUMERS AND FOR EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THEM SO I REALLY FEEL LIKE CHANGING THE EMERGENCY ROOM WILL REDUCE THE TRAUMA RELATED TO PROLONGED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES BECAUSE WE SHOULD CERTAIN WE SHOULD START HELPING PEOPLE BEFORE THEY NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED- THANK YOU THAT IS. THAT WILL BE MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TOBY EWING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THANK YOU AGAIN TOBY HEARING ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF- BECAUSE I THINK YOU HEARD TWO VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGES. FROM MISS HACK AND INDUCT MULLIN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BRING SERVICES TO PEOPLE. AND THAT ALL PASSED NEED TO LEAD TO THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. YOU KNOW FOR THE COMMISSION WHAT WHAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IS THIS EMPATHIC MODEL IS AN EXAMPLE OF A VERY CREATIVE APPROPRIATE- WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN. THE CAPACITY TO SCALE THAT OVER TIME. WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THE RIGHT KINDS OF FISCAL INCENTIVES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRAINING IF WE HAVE BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DEPLOYING THESE PROGRAMS WITH FIDELITY. TO THE MODEL WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS THAT THERE ARE EFFECTIVE THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO LEARN FROM THESE EXAMPLES. IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT PEOPLE SO WE CAN BRING THOSE TIMES DOWN EVEN MORE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM LIKE THIS ACTUALLY LEADS TO A HIGHER QUALITY OF CARE. THEY CAN- WE HOPE REDUCE THE NEED FOR REVISITING THAT THE E. R. OVERTIME. OF THE COMMISSION THIS KIND OF THE PROJECT AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH MY EARLIER COMMENTS AROUND THE MODIFICATIONS TO S. P. TWO. IT COMES AT AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT UPSTREAM OPPORTUNITIES TO DO EARLY ENGAGEMENT PREVENTION WHERE NECESSARY TO REALLY INTERVENE QUICKLY IN A CRISIS TO REDUCE THE SCALE INTENSITY DURATION. AND IDEALLY THE NUMBER OF CRISES THAT WE EXPERIENCE AND SO WE REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IT DEFEATS THE ASSET SEE BEACH DA HOSPITALS AND ELSEWHERE TO NOT JUST SCALE THIS. PROJECT BUT IDENTIFIED OTHER EXAMPLES OF VERY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE BEING. DEPLOYED IN AMONG OUR PARTNER STATEWIDE REALLY UNDERSTAND THOSE AND SCALE THIS OVER TIME SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE CARE THAT AGAIN AS AND I'LL JUST PARAPHRASE. MINTAK THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO THE WERE RESPONSIVE TO NEEDS THAT WE'RE BRINGING SERVICES TO PEOPLE RATHER THAN EXPECTING PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES IN THEIR REALITIES. TO ACCOMMODATE A SYSTEM DESIGNED THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY TAILORED WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR LIVES. THANK YOU MEDICARE NUMBERS THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JC COOPER STATE MEDIC K. DIRECTOR THE- OF HEALTH SERVICES. YOU ARE THE SUBCOMMITTEE REQUESTED THE ACS CLARIFY WHAT TYPES OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES ARE REIMBURSABLE BY MEDICARE ALL ON ALL SERVICES PROVIDED IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE COVERED BY THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN. UP FOR MEMBERS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE AND FOR MEDIC CAL FEE FOR SERVICE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE BILLED TO MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE TO OUR FISCAL INTERMEDIARY. THESE SERVICES ARE COVERED BY MANAGED CARE OR FEE FOR SERVICE REGARDLESS OF THE DIAGNOSIS MADE IN A DURING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS INCLUDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DIAGNOSES I'M THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THERE COULD BE A IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR AT MERGING TWO DEPARTMENTS YOU REALLY SEPARATE OUT VISITS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REASONS- BUT VISITS FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH REASONS AND BIFURCATING BE. A RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SAYS IT'S NOT ADVISED- ADDITIONALLY- WOULD JUST POINT OUT THOUGH- BASED ON THE COMMENTS IN THE IN THE HEARING AROUND CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS I'M IT IS THE RESPONSE WE HAVE THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE TO PAY FOR CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS OFTEN THESE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE NEAR OR ADJACENT TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AREN'T REQUIRED TO BE. HE AND I WOULD ALSO INDICATE THAT I. DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL PLACEMENT NEEDED FOR A BENEFICIARY OUTSIDE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF SERVICES BEING RECOMMENDED- IT MAY BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO COORDINATE THAT TRANSFER AND SERVICE AND THAT IS WHERE IT GETS SLIGHTLY COMPLICATED BY THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING. THE REIMBURSEMENT AND PAYMENT FOR ALL SERVICES PROVIDED IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED AFTER OR TRANSFER SERVICES MAY NOT BE THE MANAGED CARE PLANS RESPONSIBILITY MAY BE THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT- I WITH A NOTE I WILL BE THE ONLY PRESENTER FOR DH CS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN IT IS TIME. THANK YOU NECK WE'LL HEAR FROM THE CABRERA. DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIR AND MEMBERS MYSELF HAVE IT I WOULD SEE THE HTA. TODAY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS IN A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY OR HAS A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELATED EMERGENCY- CLINICIANS WILL DIRECT THAT PERSON TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR THAT EMERGENCY AND THAT DIRECTION COMES BECAUSE HOSPITALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY UNDER AND PAULA TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR ANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION ON PAR WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION. AND AS- NEWS COOPER POINTED OUT THE- MEDICAL EMERGENCIES SOMETIME MAY PRESENT AS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY THERE ARE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT YOU I'M SURE OUR WHERE I CHAIR SUCH AS A U. TI WHICH SOMETIMES- MAY APPEAR TO BE PSYCHOSIS THAT HAS BEEN UNDER UNDERLYING MEDICAL REASON AND FOR THOSE REASONS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WHEN THEY'RE HAVING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. HOWEVER ALL TOO OFTEN WHEN INDIVIDUAL SHOW UP AT THE E. B. HAVE OTHERS HAVE HAVE POINTED TO- INDIVIDUALS WITH- PERCEIVED TO BE HERE HEALTH EMERGENCIES ARE NOT ALWAYS TREATED WITH THE SAME KIND OF COMPASSIONATE CARE THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE IF THEY PRESENTED WITH THE STROKE OF BROKEN BONES OR EVEN WITH- SOME SORT OF TRAUMATIC IJURY. THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS LONGSTANDING STIGMA AND BIAS TOWARDS BE ROCKHOLD CONDITIONS THAT UNFORTUNATELY PERSISTS TODAY IN OUR MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE RESULTS ARE DEVASTATING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS- WHO MAY NOT BE HAVE THEIR ISSUES MATT TIMELY OR WHO MAY GET INAPPROPRIATELY DIVERT IT. WE'VE EVEN SEEN THAT SOMETIMES HOSPITALS MAY FAIL THE BILL- THEIR MEDIC HOW. MANAGED CARE INSURANCE OR OTHER IN SURE IT'S SERVICES FOLLOW A NUMBER A- AND SO ALL OFTHESE ISSUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS MOVING FORWARD. CURRENTLY TOWNIES HAVE BUILT OUT THE STATE WIDE NETWORK OF CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS WERE CSU PRIMARILY WITH FUNDING FROM S. B. EIGHTY TWO I WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWENTY TWELVE. TODAY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DOZEN CSU THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ROUGHLY 20% ARE HOSPITAL BASED TO OUR KNOWLEDGE FIRST I WANT TO CREDIT ARE- IMPACT PARTNERS FOR REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES OUGHT TO BE TREATED ON PAR WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. HOWEVER I MUST CAUTION BILL ZELIFF APPROACH AROUND EXPANDING CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS- AND THIS IS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF COUNTIES IN TRYING TO BUILD OUT THE A FEW CAPACITY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. FIRST I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR LIMITATION ON WHAT WE CAN BUILD FOR- AS WHAT IS CONSIDERED A CSU SERVICE THIS IS- IN STATE REGULATION. AND OFTEN TIMES BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO TRANSFER INDIVIDUALS OR THERE MAY BE- BOTTLENECKS IN TERMS OF THROUGHPUT INDIVIDUALS MAY NEED TO STAY OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT BECAUSE OF. THE IF YOU REGULATIONS WERE NOT ABLE TO BILL FOR THOSE I STAYS OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IN ADDITION THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CSU THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE VERY SMALL THEIR UNDER SIXTEEN BEDS SO THAT COUNTIES CAN RECEIVE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES AS THE ISSUES FALL UNDER THE I AND B. EXCLUSION. THIS PART ALSO CURTAILED ARE LIMITED THE EXPANSION AND THE SUSTAINABILITY AND VIABILITY OF THE EXCUSE. IN THE RECENT CALL THE PANDEMIC WE SAW THAT THOSE THROUGHPUT ISSUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATED AS MANY OF THE RECEIVING FACILITIES WHETHER THEY ARE AT HIGHER LEVELS ARE LOWER LEVELS REQUIRED KOBE NEGATIVE PASSED OR OTHER THINGS THAT WERE REALLY DIFFICULT TO SECURE WITHIN THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. WHICH JUST MADE- SISTEMI SERVICES EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE RAND ANALYSIS WHICH- DR KELLY REFERENCED EARLIER COUNTIES CURRENTLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT GAPS DEPENDING ON REGION- IN EITHER INPATIENT SUBACUTE OR RESIDENTIAL LEVELS OF CARE. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT SACRAMENTO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS THE SORT OF- INNOVATOR WHO BROUGHT FORWARD THE CONCEPT OF THE HOSPITAL BASED CSU WHICH WAS FUNDED BY THE OAC- AND THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH BIRD THROUGH OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO TRY TO REPLICATE- SOMETHING THAT IS AN INNOVATION PROJECT WE OFTEN NEED TO MODIFY IT SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH THAT IT IS CONSIDERED A DIFFERENT INNOVATION IN THE EYES OF OUR- OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. SO MOVING FORWARD WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT POTENTIALLY MAKING CHANGES TO CSU REIMBURSEMENT- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS LEVEL OF CAPACITY AND WE ALSO NEED TO ENCOURAGE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BY INDIVIDUALS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES AND WITHIN EXISTING MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES- WITH THOSE TWO STEPS WE THINK THAT WE COULD DO A LOT MORE TO- ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS DO RECEIVE CARE- ON PAR WITH THE MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KIM PETERSON SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. HELLO THANK YOU CHAIR AGAIN MY NAME IS COMPUTER SAID AND IN. ORDER FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I'LL KEEP MY REMARKS FOR THIS PANEL SHORT I. ECHO THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED BY RINA HOCK AND THANK HER FOR SHARING HER EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DURING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS. IN MY EXPERIENCE REPRESENTING PEOPLE LIVING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE POSSIBLY THE WORST PLACE FOR A PERSON EXPERIENCING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. THEY ARE NOT PRIVATE THEY'RE OFTEN CROWDED LOUD AND CHAOTIC AND THEY'RE NOT STAFFED BY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICIANS IN MANY PLACES. BECAUSE I'M OFTEN AN ADEQUATE DISCHARGE PLANNING RESOURCES COMBINED WITH A SHORTAGE OF REFERRALS INTENSIVE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND A BACKLOG AND AVAILABILITY OF INPATIENT TREATMENT BEDS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM PEOPLE MAY LANGUISH IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR DAYS. NOT ONLY DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS REYES OFF A CRISIS BUT IT OFTEN LEADS TO VIOLATIONS IMPORTANT DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. AS I STATED DURING THE PREVIOUS PANEL DRC ENCOURAGES THE STATE TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR NON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OPTIONS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT. OPTIONS SHOULD STRONGLY FAVOR VOLUNTARY LOCAL CARE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. I DO NOTHAVE ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD ON THIS TOPIC BUT AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUNS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I MEAN ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE- HERE- SUPPORT SPECIALS FROM UC DAVIS TALKED ABOUT. HOW ENTERING THE EMERGENCY ROOM- TURNED INTO A MINIMUM I THINK FOUR TO FIVE HOURS. BUT THEN ULTIMATELY WHEN THEY WERE SEEN THEY WERE THEY WERE- GIVEN BASICALLY LACK OF RESOURCES TO MOVE FORWARD. WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS BEING CLOSE TO. DIFFERENT MEDICAL FACILITIES- WELL WE'RE ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WORKED HARD ON CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. I THINK AT THAT POINT WE HAD ONE OUT AND- IN JOSHUA TREE OUT IN THE DESERT- I THINK TWELVE BEDS BUT- THE LONGEVITY OF THE STAY WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WAS- ALSO- A CONCERN. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LACK OF RESOURCES OVER THERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS IN CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR- EMERGENCY ROOMS AND- AND WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIREFIGHTERS MOVING YOU KNOW BEING CALLED THE SITUATION. BUT WE ALSO- WITHIN WE HEARD A PRESENTATION OF HOW. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL I FORGET WHICH PRISONER IT WAS THAT THEY HAVE A AN AREA NOW WHERE THEY HAVE SERVICES WITH OTHER HOSPITALS I GUESS. THAT WOULD THEN- HAVE-PEOPLE HAVE- PATIENTS THERE ARE- OUR CLIENTS BUT HOW LONG IS THAT IS THE STATE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO STAY. IN THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE NEXT STEP- CERTAINLY CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS MOBILE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. BUT ALSO- THE LONG TERM NINETY DAYS PLUS TYPE OF TREATMENT I THINK WE HAVE TO. START AT LEAST THROW INTO THE DISCUSSION- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEING BUILT OUT AND I WANT TO THANK. THOSE IN THE PRESENTERS FOR ALSO INCLUDING IN PRIOR PANELS I HAD TO STEP OUT MISTER CHAIR BUT- ON THE DISCUSSION ON TRIBAL INCLUSION- WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURAL BUILD. THAT'S THERE BUT ALSO- MAKING SURE THAT THE AGE APPROPRIATION IS THERE ALSO FOR. OUR YOUTH- OUR OUR ADOLESCENTS IT IN OUR ADULT POPULATION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PICTURE. IN FULL CIRCLE SO- COUPLE QUESTIONS AS FAR AS THE RESOURCES LEAVING- THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AT THIS POINT. WHAT RESOURCES- ARE- BEING GIVEN TO- THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEEDING THAT AND ALSO IN THOSE- WE HAVE AVAILABILITY ASIAN AREAS. WHAT IS THE LONGEVITY OF THE STATE. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT FROM THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE- WHEN WE STARTED OUT OUR LENGTH OF STAY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WAS RIGHT AROUND THIRTY TWO HOURS- FOR OUR PATIENTS. BEFORE THEY GOT PLACED IN ANOTHER FACILITY WITH OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR C. ISSUE THEY GO THROUGH A MEDICAL ASSESSMENT. AND RULE OUT ANY MEDICAL CONDITION THAT THEY THEY MAY HAVE- MOST RECENTLY IN THE FALL WE'VE GOT THAT DOWN TO JUST OVER FOUR HOURS. BUT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT THAT DOWN TO UNDER THREE. ON AND SO WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT THIS TOO- MOVE PATIENTS FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT INTO. OUR CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS SO THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT PROVIDERS. IN THE LONGEVITY OF STAY AT THE- CSU'S HOURS- IT WHEN WE STARTED OUT IT WAS A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THREE SOMEONE MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO SOME PATIENTS HAVE TO STAY LONGER THAN TWENTY THREE HOURS THAT DOES OCCUR- THAT AND HOW THEY ARE CORRECT WE CANNOT BILL FOR ANYTHING OVER. TWENTY THREE HOURS AND FIFTY NINE MINUTES- BUT WE WORK VERY HARD TO GET THAT LIKE TO STAY- INSURANCE WE CAN. THANK YOU AYE I WANNA BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR- I WILL START- BY IDENTIFYING THE DATA POINTS THAT BOTH OF THE PHYSICIANS BROUGHT UP AND- M. PATH AS A MODEL DECREASING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT LENGTH OF STAY BY 70% IS SIGNIFICANT. OUR ABILITY TO DECREASED IN PATIENTS LIKE HIGH PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSIONS. BY 53% IS SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT AS WELL AS THE IMPROVED OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP. WILL HELP US WITH TREATMENT PLANS. THAT I REALLY WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT TV TOBY EWING SAID THAT THIS IS BOTH CREATIVE AND APPROPRIATE. AND THAT WE HAVE CAPACITY FOR US TO SCALE. I'M FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE ABILITY BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. IS THAT THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN SHOULD BILL FOR ALL SERVICES WHILE THEY'RE IN THE- EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BUT THAT AS SOON AS WE TRANSFER- TO A CSU. THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF- REIMBURSEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. HOW WE HELP TO CREATE SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THIS MODEL WHILE THE- INNOVATION DOLLARS MAY HELP US TO CREATE THE SPACE IT REALLY WILL BE THE BILLING LONG TERM. THAT CREATES THE SUSTAINABILITY THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU- WHERE THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES RIGHT NOW- WITH THE CSU MODEL IN TERMS OF CREATING THAT LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. YOUR HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE MODELS TALKED ABOUT TODAY ON THIS HEARING- ARE ARE REALLY GOOD RIGHT IN REGARDS TO IDENTIFYING ASSESSING IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY OR NOT AND IF IT IS NOT A CURRENT EMERGENCY TRANSFERRED TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICE LIKE A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT- AND WHAT WAS STATED. OF PREVIOUSLY IS CORRECT UNDER FEDERAL LAW SOMEONE IS NOT ALLOWED TO STAY IN A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT FOR MORE THAN THAT ARE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT I'D SAY SO TWENTY THREE HOURS FIFTY. NINE SECONDS THAT ARE MINUTES AS I MENTIONED IS CORRECT IT REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY- IF YOU HAVE A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE- WITH ACCESS TO OUTPATIENT AND RESIDENTIAL SERVICES FOR APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME SOMEONE IN A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT. SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED FOR PLACEMENT- IN VARIOUS OTHER OUTPATIENT SETTINGS OR RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS OR INPATIENT DEPENDING ON WHAT'S NEEDED BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT- BY THE CLINICAL STAFF BEING ABLE TO TRANSFER THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT. CAN YOU BUILDING OUT IN THE FIRST AND- ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW MORE CRAZY CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS BUT ALSO. MORE OUTPATIENT MORE RESIDENTIAL MORE IMPATIENT WHEN NEEDED THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE CLEAR GAPS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN REGARDS TO SPECIALLY RURAL FRONTIER IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE OF WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ALLOW FOR. BOTH THAT PREVENTED AND- UPSTREAM AS A TOBY WAS MENTIONING BUT ALSO TO ALLOW FOR APPROPRIATE TRANSITIONS OF CARE WHICH IS STANDARD IN OTHER PARTS OF HEALTH CARE. AND REALLY THAT'S THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT TO ALLOW FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SMOOTH THE TRANSITION INTO REALLY BUILD OUT THE FULL CONTINUUM. OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER- WAS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE PATIENTS IN THE CSU'S ARE FROM MEDICAID AND SO I'M REALLY LOOKING TO MEDIC CAL ITSELF TO SEE IF THERE ARE- ISSUES WITH ITS CURRENT STATE THAT LEADS TOWARDS CSU'S NOT BEING SUSTAINABLE THAT I'M HOPING EITHER DR THOMAS R. DR MULLIN MAY BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON WAYS OUR MANNERS IN WHICH WE COULD CREATE THAT SUSTAINABILITY. AS AN EXAMPLE- IS THERE A NEED FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS OBSERVATION STATUS FOR PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS- IS THAT CURRENTLY SOMETHING THAT MEDIC CAL- ALLOWS AND- WAR ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SHOULD WE LOOK TOWARDS THE RE PROCUREMENT PROCESS TO INSURE US GOING FORWARD THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE THAT SUSTAINABILITY HOPING DR THOMAS R. MULLEN CAN. STEP IN. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT. I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS- SO CURRENTLY. MEDIC HOW DOES NOT REIMBURSE FOR OBSERVATION CARE FOR PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT MANY CAL REIMBURSES FOR EACH OBSERVATION CARE IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AT ALL- AND SO I THINK SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE HEARING AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW. WE ALL WANT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING. APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE IS THAT THE EDT IS A BAN EXCLUDED FROM A LOT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT. FOR PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO THEN TRANSITION ACROSS INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT'S REALLY EASY TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS- STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR COOPER CAN I HAVE YOU COMMENT ON WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM DOCTOR MULLIN- I DO BELIEVE IT IS- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY COVER OBSERVATION AND MEDIKAL HOWEVER I'D WANT TO GO BACK IN. A CONFIRM WITH MY BENEFITS AN ELIGIBILITY GROUP- HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE IT'S FOR ALL SERVICES UNDER PARITY WE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO JUST DENIED OBSERVATION PORT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION ALSO THAT POLICY WOULD BE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR A OBSERVATION REIMBURSEMENT IF THAT'S HELPFUL. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP ON THAT CONVERSATION- WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WE'VE- REALIZE THAT OBSERVATION STATUS OFTENTIMES- HELPS US TO PREVENT INPATIENT STAYS AND- MUCH OF THE DATA THAT IS BEARING OUT FROM M. PATH IS ALSO SHOWING A DECREASE IN THOSE ADMISSIONS. AND SO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S- AN APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL MODEL FOR US TO CREATE THE SUSTAINABILITY NEEDED TO HELP TO- SCALED THIS PROGRAM TO THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE. BUT SEEING AS THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK THIS ENTIRE PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO A PANEL FIVE ON ACCESS TO. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WE WILL HAVE NINE SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE DIRECTOR WATANABE CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. FROM.

OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND WHAT THE CHANGES AND SB TWO TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BUILD OUT THE COUNTRY'S MOST STRINGENT NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS FOR TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. THEY HAVE A HEALTH PLANS ARE BOTH SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING BY DH CS FOR MEETING THESE AND OTHER NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS BUT WE ALSO SERVE AS AN OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER PRIMARILY FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. WHO ARE UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED BY THEIR INSURANCE DUE TO INADEQUATE NETWORKS OR BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AFFORDABILITY AGED HIGH PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS. DO THE CUPBOARD HANDLE MAKING ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOR HEALTH IMPACTS WE ARE EXPERIENCING INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICES AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE WORST WORKFORCE CRISIS WE HAVE EVER SEE. TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN BOTH. A BLESSING AND A CURSE AS IT HAS ALLOWED US TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND SOME SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC WELL IT'S ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR OUR STAFF TO BE RECRUITED TO WORK FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR HOMES. SERVING INDIVIDUALS IN NEED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED THIS YEAR WILL BE SELLING PORTENT. FOR PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OUR PEERS FOR CLINICIANS ALCOHOL AND DRUG COUNSELORS LICENSE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS PSYCH AND PEAS PSYCHIATRISTS ADDICTION DOCKS WE NEED ALL OF THEM. BUT I MUST CAUTION THAT WITHOUT EXPANDED BASE FUNDING TO BUILD OUT NETWORKS OVER THE LONG RUN WE WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO INCREASE DEMAND. CAN BE EVER HELD FUNDING IS NOT TIED TO DEMAND AND OUR COUNTIES HAVE ABSORBED THE COST OF THE EXPANDED MEDICAL S. U. D. BENEFIT UNDER. ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S AN OPTIONAL BENEFIT FOR COUNTIES BUT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL ONE. AS WE STARE THE S. U. D. CRISIS IN THE FACE AND AS A MOTHER OF A YOUNG WOMAN IN RECOVERY AND THE SISTER OF THREE SIBLINGS LIVING IN RECOVERY FROM THEIR ADDICTIONS AND CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE BUILD. FROM THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT BY COUNTIES- SO WE BUILD OUT THE CAPACITY FOR A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF COMPREHENSIVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE. THIS INCLUDES THE ESSENTIAL INCLUSION OF EXPANDED MAPPED. IDEAS NOT CAN'T REVERSE MY KIDS OVERDOSE IN MY RESIDENCE BACK THAT I HAD TO FIGHT MY PHARMACY TO CAT. AND I STAND BESIDE HER AS SHE ATTEMPTS TO GET AND KEEP A METHADONE PROVIDER. THE SAME AS I STAND WITH DH CS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED THIS LEVEL OF CARE THANK YOU.

A TREATMENT- DTS AND DONE SO MUCH THEY HAVEWAVED AT PROVIDERS THAT IF FOCUSED ON ACCESS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LINKAGES BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RIGHT THE EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION I'VE BEEN INCLUSIVE OF PROVIDERS AND THE EXPERIENCE. AFTER AVERAGE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE PARTICULARLY AS WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC AS WE KNOW THAT DEMAND FOR TREATMENT WILL ONLY INCREASE. THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE INCLUDING REACHING THE HEART ARTERY COPULATION SUCH AS HOMELESS IN REENTRY POPULATIONS. REVISING REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET M. A. T. THAT THOSE WHO NEED IT. TRAINING AND RECRUITING FILL BASS AND EIGHTY PER SECOND PROVIDE MEDICATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO EXPANDING THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL PHARMACIES TO GET THEM ON BOARD WITH STOCKING THE MEDICATION AND BEING WILLING TO FILL THE PRESCRIPTIONS. PARTICULARLY WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND WE CAN'T DISCUSS TIMELY ACCESS WITHOUT OUT THE ISSUE THAT IS HAMPERING THE ABILITY TO MEET TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE ALL. HEARD THE STATISTICS ON THE INCREASED MEDICAL AND ROMAN AND THAT'S. DR KELLY JUST MENTIONED PROVIDER. ON PROCESS THE- STAFF IS. SOME OF OUR CBO SAID HAD TO SHUT DOWN ON BADS IN CLINICS BASE DUE TO LACK OF STAFFING. AND ON THE FLIP SIDE WE PROVIDERS DO YOU HAVE EXTRA CAPACITY TO DO MORE THE INCREASE DOLLARS TO MEET THE NEEDS ARE NOT ALWAYS PROVIDED DUE TO CONTRACT MAXIMUMS WITH MANY OF THEIR COUNTIES. ALL EQUATES TO DENY CARE TO THOSE IN. NEED OUR PROVIDERS NEAR SIMULTANEOUS AND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES CHAPMAN I'M A MORE H. THE DIRE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND ALLOW FOR MORE COULD WE JUST FOR RETAINING AND RECRUITING FOR THE WORK FORCE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME ASSURE. THE PERSPECTIVE OF RCB APARTMENT ON. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR TYLER RANDY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD EVENING CHEN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS HI RANDY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CASKEY UNDERSTAND I'D LIKE TO- ECHO A LOT OF THE SENTIMENTS OF MY FELLOW PANELISTS AND THANK YOU TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE CREDIT APPLICATION I'M BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- I DO I HAVE YEAH WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT AND FOCUS AND REMIND THE- SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYMENT REFORM AND DOCUMENTATION REFORM PATTERSON PROPOSED ACCOUNT NAME. AND IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED AS CALIFORNIA MARKS UPON PAYMENT REFORM FROM A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT THREE CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SYSTEM TO INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS WITH THE FIRST SERVICE RATES. WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION OF HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET THE RATES RIGHT INCLUDING CAPTURING ALL EXISTING COSTS TO PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM AND HOW DEVELOPING RATES THAT ARE FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE THAT ALLOW PROVIDERS AND COUNTIES TO HIRE AND PAY COMPETITIVE AGES. AND PASSED IN THE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION THAT WE WANT TO SEE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY ALLOW US TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT EVIDENCE BASED CARE TO INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OUT OF PAPER HEALTH SERVICE SAYS. WE'RE EQUALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT AS A MATTER HOW BENEFIT A MOTIVATIONAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MEETING SPECIFIED GOALS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS WITH STIMULATE USE DISORDERS. THERE'S NO FORM OF MEDICATION FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT FOR MATTHEWS AND SOME CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT AS A CRITICAL TOOL IN ADDRESSING MAP ANOTHER STIMULATE YEARS WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE IS STARTING SMALL WITH THE PROJECT BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE AS THE PROJECT IS HOPE WE SUCCESSFUL. TO EXPAND TO OTHER SUBSTANCE AS BEYONCE REMAINS AND TO OTHER REGIONS AND POPULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE PILOTS WHILE I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE FOCUS OF NEXT WEEK'S HEARING- I THINK IT'S AN POP IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A HEARING ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITHOUT MENTIONING WORKFORCE IS A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE. I HAD A RECENTLY A PROVIDER SHARE WITH ME BACK- YOU KNOW THE NEED. DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR SERVICES NEVER STOCKS IN THE ON LIMITING. IN THEY WORKS. A BEING ABLE TO SERVICE TO ME THE NEED. WITH THE ABILITY RECRUIT AND RETAIN AND IN FACT WORK. OUR HAS PROVIDERS THAT ARE DOWN 30% STAFF. AND AS OTHER SECTORS HAVE INVESTED IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE WHICH WE SUPPORT. IT HAD INCLUDING CDC OURS EXPANSION OF THE I. S. U. T. T. PROGRAM AND HOSPITALS EXPANDING THE BRIDGE PROGRAM. IT HAS PULLED STAFF AWAY FROM COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE WORTHWHILE INVESTMENTS. BUT ALONG WITH THE PANDEMIC IT MEANS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A DEDICATED INVESTMENT S. UT CARE WORKFORCE. SB SIX SIX SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK-SILVA AND SPONSORED BY MY COLLEAGUE RECIBE HA AND CAP- THE TAP. IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP TO DOCUMENTING THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE AND PROVIDING OPTIONS FOR WORKFORCE FUNDING- BUT WE NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN THIS- WE APPRECIATE YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR YOU KNOW BRINGING FOR THE SPELL. WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS THAT FIND IT MORE LUCRATIVE TO GO PARK AND PUBLIC SCHOOL PASSED THE JOINT OR IN RETAIL THAT IN OUR SYSTEM. THEY'RE CALTRAIN WE'RE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BILL FOR SERVICES UP TO NINETY DAYS FROM. PRE RELEASE ON BEING DISCUSSED IN THE DH CS IS CALLIN JUSTICE ADVISORY WORKGROUP. INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR FIRST TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE- AFTER RELEASE ARE OVER FORTY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY AN OVERDOSE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. IN UPWARDS OF 80% AND CDCR INMATES HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. THEIR INVESTMENTS THAT CDCR HAS MADE. THEIR OVER NOW THIRTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ON MATC NCDC ARW. PRE RELEASE CARE MANAGEMENT AND MEDICATION COORDINATION ART KERR ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT- SERVICES ARE TRANSITION SEAMLESSLY. WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO LOOK AT EXISTING MODELS OF PRE RELEASE COORDINATION INCLUDING THROUGH THE STOCK CONTRACTS. WHICH REGIONAL CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES CARE COORDINATION TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. AND SUPPORTS THE PAROLEES RELEASE SEEN FROM CITY ARE WE MODERN THE HIGHEST YOU CAN NEEDS AS A STATE LUCK AT B. POTENTIAL THE NINE DAY RELEASE. AS IS YOU KNOW WE ARE SUPPORTED THE STATE'S AND EIGHTY EXPANSION PROJECT. AND ARE STILL REVIEW THE S. AND- BCPL TRAILER LANGUAGE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHEN ADDS ON A BATON WHO IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR. FOR DPA PLEASE BEGIN. INTERNATIONAL BEING AWARE- HELLO BUT THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE- YOU KNOW I'M GONNA ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MY- FIRE COLLEAGUES OF ME ON THIS PANEL I'M DEEPLY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF ENSURING THAT WE DO HAVE THINGS LIKE MADDOX EXPANSION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSTAND FROM A RACIAL EQUITY PERSPECTIVE. THAT UNFORTUNATELY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STILL LAG FAR BEHIND THOSE OF OTHERS. IN TERMS OF ACT- BEING- NOT ONLY OFFERED BUT ALSO HAVING ACCESS TO MATH SERVICES WHICH WE KNOW. ARE CRITICAL- IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE AND TO ADDRESS- THE OVERDOSE CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THE PANDEMIC- HAS EXACERBATED- THE OVERDOSE CRISIS SIGNIFICANTLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC DPA COMMISSIONED A STUDY TO LOOK AT THE LEFT. OF OPIOID OVERDOSE RATE IN CALIFORNIA NO OTHER STUDY HAS LOOKED AT A SPECIFIC AND ETHNICITY. LOOKING AT STATE LEVEL DATA. AND WHAT WE FOUND PEOPLE THAT MAC WAS THAT IN FIVE COUNTIES ON WHICH INCLUDED NEVADA LASSEN LAKE MENDOCINO IN SAN FRANCISCO. ON THE OVERDOSE CRISIS AMONG LATINOS WAS ACTUALLY REALLY HIGH AND- AND IN SOME CASES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SO REALLY LOOKING AT INTERVENTIONS AND WAYS. TO ENSURE THAT- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- HAVE ACCESS TO NOT ONLY SERVICES BUT- THAT- YOU KNOW. INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING BACK. UP ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- IN L. A. COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- ACCIDENTAL DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH RATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND- POPULATION. INCREASE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. FOUR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ASIANS ACCIDENTAL DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH RATES INCREASED BY SEVENTY FIVE POINT SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE AMONG AFTER CAN AMERICAN WITH LATINO- CHANGE BEHIND BY AN INCREASE OF. NUMBERS- ANOTHER- OF STUDY RECENTLY EXAMINING THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF LATINOS ASIANS IN CALIFORNIA DEMONSTRATED THAT MORE INVESTMENT IS NEEDED FOR THE STATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STATE'S TO MOST ETHNICALLY DIVERSE GROUPS IN SURVEYS. THAT WERE CONDUCTED 20% OF ADULTS AND REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SERIOUS OR MODERATE- PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS YET ONLY 17% OF LATINOS AND 14% OF ASIAN AMERICANS REPORTED THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL FOR PROBLEMS WITH MENTAL. HEALTH MOTIONS AND OR- AKA HALL AND DRUG USE. OTHER GROUPS EXPERIENCE THESE DISPARITIES THAT THE STUDY REALLY- BUT THE STUDY REALLY- DID SOMETHING INNOVATIVE AND REALLY LOOK AT THE SUBGROUPS OF BOTH LATINOS AND ASIANS IN CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT MONOLITHS AND INSTEAD LOOKED AT THE VARIATIONS THAT EXISTED- WITHIN THESE ETHNIC SUBGROUPS- TOPLINE- RECOMMENDATIONS FROM. THIS REPORT- REALLY LOOKS AT WAYS. FOR ENSURING THAT- COMMUNITIES OF AND AT THE COMMUNITY- HAVE ACCESS TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCREASING- ETHNIC REPRESENTATION IN DECISION MAKING. PROCESS SEES FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND ALSO THE- POLICY IS TO COLLECT ANSWER BUT TO COLLECT DATA ON THAT IS ALSO DISAGGREGATED FOR I'M NOT ONLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY BUT FOR THE APEC COMMUNITY AND OTHER ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA- DEMYSTIFYING THESE- THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. FOR THESE COMMUNITIES WILL GO A LONG WAY AND WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE SERVICES THE MOST ARE BEING SERVED- BY THE STATE- IN IN THE NUMBERS THAT THEY REPRESENT HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WILL CONCLUDE THE PRESENTERS FOR THIS PANEL I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS. FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO REITERATE- WHAT DR- RUNNING TO CALLIE- SPOKE TO AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO ACQUIT- THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ONE- DRUG OVERDOSES ARE ARE AT A HIGH- PERCENTAGE- AFFECTING PEOPLE OF COLOR IN OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE REALLY AVAILABLE- THE USE OF NOR CAN- SO THAT THOSE COULD BE TRAINED- IN ABLE TO ADMINISTER THOSE TO LOVED ONES OR EVEN THOSE THAT ARE PARTAKING WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE. THE READILY AVAILABLE IN TIME OF NEED WE ALSO WANT TO- BRING TO ATTENTION- AB BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THAT WOULD START TO MOVE FORWARD THE DIALOGUE. AND THE ADVOCACY OF MAKING SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT THAT THAT NEED TO HAVE THOSE OF RESOURCES READILY AVAIL AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND TO START THE DIALOGUE ON THE I BELIEVE ANOTHER AND I KNOW THIS IS A- THE WE HAVE A LOT OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONS ON BUT I THINK AN EPIDMIC WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH OVERDOSES WITH FENTANYL. AND SO WE HAVE TO START TO ADDRESS IT WE HAVE TO START TO MAKE SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. FOR THOSE IN TIME. AND TIME SENSITIVE AREAS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BEEN A MINISTER NOR CAN AND THAT MEANS GETTING THAT INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE THAT ON THEIR POSSESSION. THANK YOU AND I WILL FOLLOW ALONG WITH WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. SAID AND IF WE LOOK AT PAGE FORTY THREE OF THE AGENDA. WE SEE FROM THE CDC THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED. OF DRUG OVERDOSES IN THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD THAT ENDED IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE FIRST. YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. THAT WAS A TWENTY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR BEFORE. AND IT'S AWFUL DOUBLING OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND WHAT WE SAW FROM THAT WAS THAT FENTANYL ACCOUNTED 464% OF ALL OF THOSE DRUG. OVERDOSE DEATHS DURING THAT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD SO I WILL ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR CAN IS- IN AS MANY HANDS AS WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN- EXPAND AND- INCREASE ITS REACH. I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT- JUST RECENTLY WE HAD. AN INCIDENT AT A FRESNO COUNTY JAIL. WHERE FENTANYL EXPOSURE LED TOWARDS SEVEN PEOPLE AT THAT JAIL- BEING EXPOSED AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ACCESS TO MATCH SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED. ASSIST THOSE PEOPLE AT THAT COUNTY JAIL AND WANTED TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THAT PROGRAM. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS FIRST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND THEN. FOLLOWING UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M I'M REALLY TRYING TO. GET A SENSE OF HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT PLANS ARE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE. CREATED SO FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. CAN YOU HELP TO EXPLAIN WHAT. THE CURRENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACCESS TO CARE STANDARDS ARE. AND HOW WE MONITOR OF PLANS COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS. ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS HOW ARE THE PLANS DOING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO- THE DVC MEASURES- BEHAVIOR HEALTH ACCESS A COPLE OF WAYS ONE. WHO ARE INITIAL REVIEW OF HEALTH PLAN NETWORKS WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A LICENSE. AS WELL AS ANNUALLY REVIEWING THEIR NETWORKS TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THEIR GOAL. THE SECOND COMPONENT IS THE ACTUAL STANDARDS WHICH IS. FOR A SPECIALIST POSITION. AT THE STANDARD IS FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS AND FOR NON PHYSICIAN MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS THE STANDARD IS TEN BUSINESS DAYS. AND SO WE ASSESSED HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE WITH THAT YOU ARE A NEW ANNUAL. TIMELY ACCESS PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO USE. SURVEY A SAMPLE OF THEIR HEALTH. CARE NETWORK PROVIDERS TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE AN OF THEIR NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT IS WITHIN THOSE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. AND THEN THE NOTE THAT INFORMATION TO US. BY THAT TO THIS ONE NATO BASES THERE COMPLIANCE REPORTING. AND THEN WE PUBLISH ANNUAL IN A PUBLIC REPORT THAT OUTLINES THE HEALTH PLANS- RESERVE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TIMELY ACCESS SURVEYS. CERTAIN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS IT DIDN'T TAKE THAT BACK TO SEE EXACTLY HOW EACH OF OUR HERO HEALTH PLANS ARE PERFORMING. IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO AGAIN AS WE ARE LOOKING AT PRE PROCUREMENT I BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. WORKING WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ADDRESS- IN LIGHT OF- WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH OVERDOSE DEATHS FOR OUR STATE- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I WAS HOPING. SIMILARLY YOU COULD- HELP TO EXPLAIN THE EXISTING TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS MUST MEET. AND WHICH METRICS WE ARE USING TO EVALUATE COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE STANDARDS AND AGAIN TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE- BELIEVE THAT. THE PLANS ARE MEETING THOSE STANDARDS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THE APARTMENT MANAGE HEALTHCARE WE HOLD OUR MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IN A DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM PLANS TO USE THE SAME TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS IN THE SAME NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL WE WILL HEAR FROM ELLEN FOXMAN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS PLEASE BEGIN. THE NATURE ARAMBULA AND MA'AM ELLEN BACHMAN TO. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS STATE WIDE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT DIVISION. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS PROPOSES ONE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND AND ELEVEN POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT STANDARDS COMPLIANCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OPERATIONS AND TO PROVIDE THE OFFICE OF AUDITS WITH NECESSARY RESOURCES TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE AUDITS. THE STATE WIDE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT DIVISION GUIDES AND MONITORS POLICY FORMULATION AND INTEGRATION OF OUR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE FIVE STATE HOSPITALS. THE DIVISION HAS FOUR UNITS THE STATE WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM UNIT PROVIDES OVERALL DIRECTION FOR THE DIVISION AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENTS GOVERNING BODY THE STANDARDS COMPLIANCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT UNITS PROVIDE CENTRALIZED OVERSIGHT OF HOSPITAL COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THE OFFICE OF AUDITS CONDUCTS AUDITS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACCOUNTING CONTROLS. AND ENTERPRISE HEALTH AND SAFETY COORDINATESTHE DEPARTMENT'S OCCUPATIONAL SUCH SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAMS CAL OSHA COMPLIANCE. AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. THE RESOURCES REQUESTED WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. TO MONITOR CDPH LICENSING AND JOINT COMMISSION SURVEY FINDINGS INCIDENTS CITATIONS AND DEFICIENCIES. TO ENSURE COMPLETION OF STATEWIDE CLINICAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS AND A WIDE RANGE OF PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. MS TO MENTOR AND CONSULT WITH STATE HOSPITAL STAFF TO ENSURE STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY IN IMPLEMENTING NEW REGULATIONS POLICIES PRACTICE STANDARDS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE OFFICE OF AUDITS THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FOCUS IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AUDITS IN RESPONSE TO WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS AND SERVING AS THE LIAISON AND COORDINATOR TO EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PERFORM AUDITS OF D. S. H. FUNCTIONS. DUE TO THE UNABATED. WORKLOAD IN THESE AREAS AND OFFICE ABOUT ITS LIMITED STAFFING DSHS UNABLE TO PERFORM INTERNAL FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE AUDITS TO HELP US MITIGATE RISK IN THESE AREAS AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS ESSENTIAL FUNCTION. A B. C. P. FOR THESE RESOURCES WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WAS WITHDRAWN IN THE MAY REVISION BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND PROJECTED GENERAL FUND DEFICIT THAT CALIFORNIA WAS FACING DUE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE STATE WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT DIVISION SUBSEQUENTLY PRIORITIZED MISSION CRITICAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES PRIMARILY IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC RESPONSE. HOWEVER THE CRITICAL NEED TO ENHANCE OUR STANDARDS COMPLIANCE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND- AUDITING CAPABILITIES STILL REMAINS. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TOBY EWING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD EVENING WELL- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK. VERY QUICKLY. AS OUTLINED BY DEPUTY DIRECTOR KELLY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS THE KEY OVERSIGHT AGENCY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE AUDITORS WE DON'T DO WE DON'T DO COMPLIANCE REVIEWS. THE COMMISSION HAS AN OVERSIGHT ROLE THAT IS MORE AKIN TO A GRAND JURY A SPECIALIZED GRAND JURY ON MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDER TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE- AND THE STATUTE STIPULATES THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIES A CHALLENGE IN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM. WE REPORT THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS THEY HAVE THE A MUCH BROADER ARRAY OF TOOLS. TO ADDRESS THOSE KINDS OF CHALLENGES. IN CONTRAST. OUR FOCUS IS REALLY AROUND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM- ADVISING THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ON POLICY OR PRACTICE CHANGE. DEVELOPING STRATEGIES AND TOOLS TO REALLY DRIVE WHAT WE REFER TO AS TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE THE CONVERSATION EARLIER TONIGHT AROUND THE M. PATH MODEL AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PRACTICE THAT HAS LOTS OF SUPPORT. BEHIND IT BUT IS NOT SCALING ON ITS OWN AND SO THE COMMISSION USES ITS AUTHORITIES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THESE ISSUES TO IDENTIFY THESE ISSUES I CAN SAY IN THE DRAW ATTENTION TO THEM. AND THEN REALLY WORK WITH POLICY MAKERS ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER PARTNERS TO SEE IF WE CAN- SUPPORT THE SCANNING OF THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES. PART OF OUR WORK ONE OF OUR SAID DEFINITION OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC- BUT INCLUDING POLICY MAKERS PRACTITIONERS. ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S WORKING IN OUR SYSTEM IN AREAS THAT AREN'T WORKING AS WELL. AND REALLY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FACILITATE SHIPS IN OUR STRATEGY SO THAT WE GET BETTER OUTCOMES BETTER BANG FOR THE BUCK SO TO SPEAK. IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THE IMAGES SAY VERY CLEARLY CALLS FOR A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL AS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THE LEVEL OF THE COMMISSION. AND THE LANGUAGE STIPULATES THAT THAT IN PLANNING FOR HOW TO SPEND IMAGES SAY DOLLARS FOR THINKING MORE BROADLY ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF THAT SYSTEM. MENTAL HEALTH PEERS AND CLIENTS FAMILY MEMBERS PROVIDERS AND OTHERS TO REALLY BE PART OF THE- THE WAY IN WHICH THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED WITHIN FORWARD. THE COMMISSION'S WORK IS REALLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE WHAT WE MIGHT CALL INFORMED CONSENT OF THAT PROCESS THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING IN THREE PRIMARY AREAS THE FIRST IS FINANCING. THE LAW REQUIRES COUNTIES TO ENGAGE MENTAL HEALTH. THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY AROUND HOW TO SPEND FUNDING AND SO WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS AVAILABLE SO THAT THOSE THOSE DECISIONS CAN BE INFORMED. BY THAT INFORMATION SECOND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE AROUND THE STATE THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF STRATEGIES IN PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTIES. ALL OF THAT WERE TAKES EXAMPLE THE EMPATHIC MODEL IS UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION WHERE IS IT IN PLACE SOMEWHERE ISN'T IT IN PLACE. AND HOW MIGHT WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY PARTNERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. TO REALLY PUT IN PLACE THE PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO NEEDS. AND THE THIRD ISSUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS OUTCOMES AND SO WE WORK WITH THE H. YES TO WORK THERE CAN BE FOR HEALTH. PARTNERS BUT ALSO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO TELL WELFARE DEPARTMENT- THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH. TO SEE IF WE CAN IDENTIFY CORE METRICS THAT CAN INFORM THESE DECISIONS OVER TIME. THE GOAL IS REALLY TO A QUICK POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THEY HAVE TODAY. TO MAKE GOOD EVALUATED DECISIONS IF THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE FUNDING AND THE EFFORT THEY WERE PUTTING FORTH. AND IF WE'RE NOT HOW CAN WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND REALLY DRIVE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE AND PART OF THAT IS BEING HONEST ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE FUNDING WE HAVE. WHERE WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HOW WE CAN DESIGN STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE RECOGNIZING THE DIVERSITY OF ISSUES FROM IMPERIAL TO DOWNARD. THAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. BUT FOR THE END GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED. IN WAYS THAT ARE TIMELY RESPONSIVE LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THE IMAGES THAT CALLS FOR. WHICH IS YOU KNOW VERY BROADLY SPEAKING REALLY ABOUT WELLNESS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HOUSING THEY'RE NOT CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED. THERE THAT FAMILIES ARE INTACT AND NOT INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. STUDENTS ARE SUCCEEDING IN SCHOOL. ADULTS ARE SUCCEEDING AND IN THE WORK FORCE IF APPROPRIATE AND THAT THEIR ARRAY OF STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING UPSTREAM TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY HAPPY. AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DR VERONICA KELLY. CHIEF OF MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOVERY SERVICES IN ORANGE COUNTY PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED ARAMBULA AB ALTHOUGH COUNTIES ARE AWARE OF CONCERNS ABOUT AND SPENT AN HSA FUNDING IN THE PAST. MHSAA HAS BEEN A VITALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF COUNTY FUNDING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND I JUST SAID FUNDS ARE OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING. AND WITH IT WE LEVERAGE WELL OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN MANTA CAL IT FUNDS THE CRISIS SYSTEM THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER HOUSING FOR OUR CLIENTS. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SHIP SERVICES COMMUNITY DEFINED PRACTICES PREVENTION AND SO MUCH MORE. IN FACT THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT ARE AN HSA FUNDS DO NOT TOUCH. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS LESS THAN 1% OF IMAGES THAT BONDS HAVE BEEN REVERTED AND RE DISTRIBUTED DUE TO LACK OF EXPENDITURE. CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH SPENDING ARE TYPICAL- AND WERE USUALLY FOUND WITHIN THE INNOVATIONS COMPONENT WHICH IS THE ONLY FUNDING CATEGORY THAT REQUIRES STATE LEVEL APPROVAL. COUNTIES MUST SPEND BONDS WITH INPUT FROM OUR COMMUNITIES ON THREE YEAR CYCLES FOR LARGE COUNTIES AND FIVE YEAR SPENDING CYCLES FOR SMALLER COUNTIES. MAJESTIC PINES ARE MOST VOLATILE FUNDING SOURCE WHEN FUNDING DIPPED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW BUDGET AMOUNTS AS WAS IN THE CASE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAXES WERE DEFERRED OR WHEN THEY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY SUCH AS IN THIS YEAR WE MUST GO BACK TO OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO UPDATE OUR PLANNED ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEED. STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS REQUIRED ASPECT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS DOWN IN OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES COMMITTEE AND PUT THAT MAY NOT EXIST ELSEWHERE TO ADDRESS EQUITY CIVILIAN VALUE THIS REQUIREMENT AS A CORE WAY OF DEVELOPING OUR EXPENDITURE PLANS. WE UNDERSTANDTHAT THE ALWAYS HE HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN WITH FUND BALANCES FROM YEAR TO YEAR HOWEVER IS THE STATE HAS REPORTED. ON AVERAGE COUNTIES TYPICALLY SPEND DOWN MOST IF NOT ALL OF OUR IMAGES A FUNDS BY YEAR TWO OF OUR THREE YEAR FUNDING CYCLE. THE FACT THAT FUNDS ARE NOT SPENT DOWN CHARLIE IN YOUR WINE IS A FEATURE. NOT A BUG OF THIS UNIQUE PROCESS FOR COMMUNITY INPUT AND ENGAGEMENT IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS WHICH WE VALUE SO MUCH. ADJUSTMENTS ALSO NEED TO BE MADE TO DEAL WITH THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNDING. THE ULTIMATE MEASURE FOR US IS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH COUNTY SPEND DOWN THESE BONDS TO MEET PREVENTION INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT NEEDS OF OUR TO OUR. DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND WHICH TO DATE AS CONSISTENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT THE PRESENTERS ON PANEL SIX I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS I'D LIKE TO END WITH THAT LAST COMMENT IF I COULD REGARDING- THE- COUNTIES AND- THE COMMISSION'S ASSESSMENT. ON WHETHER OR NOT- THEY HAVE LARGE RESERVES AND I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT TO TOBY HAD SAID THAT IT REALLY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT HAS THE- TOOLS NEEDED THAT. WHAT WE HAVE ON THE AGENDA IS THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL THAT COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY NOT- SUBMITTING THE FISCAL DATA FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION SO WE CAN HAVE THAT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY. I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS FOR DOCTOR PFEIFFER. I'M SORRY I JUST HAD A TECHNICAL GLITCH I FELT TERRIBLY CAN YOU CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR. WHAT YOU WHAT YOU NEED FOR CONSTRUCTION PLENTY OF COUNTIES ARE NOT REPORTING THE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN USE THIS FISCAL TANSPARENCY TOOL WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE EXPECTATION. WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS FISCAL TRANSPARENCY. I THINK I MAY NOT BE UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE REPORTING I'M ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPORTING ON THEIR- ANNUAL REVENUE AND EXPENSE. REPORT WHICH WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT EVERY WEEK SAID MEANT TOO- B. L. A. C. WHO THEN REPORT ON THE TRANSPARENCY TO ALSO AND I MAY NOT AND BE UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE COUNTY DOESN'T WITH. A MAIL OUT TO BE YOU INTO STEP IN IF. PLEASE IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR SO WHEN WE WORK IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF WE REPORTED THAT WE HAD. A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTY REPORT SO THE DATA COME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES PREPARES A FILE AND THEN IT COMES TO US. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING QUESTIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS ABOUT THE FUND BALANCES THAT COUNTIES RECEIVE. ON OUR WEBSITE WE INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF IMAGES SAY FINDING IT SAID IT'S A REAL TIME MONTH TO MONTH REPORT ON THE REVENUES THAT ARE COMING IN. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT REVENUES THIS YEAR I SHOULD SAY LAST YEAR EXCEEDED THE PRIOR YEAR AND THIS YEAR THEY'RE EXCEEDING LAST YEAR. AND THAT THE VAST BULK OF THOSE FUNDS COME IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. ENDED AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF CONCERNS THAT IS THEY WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS TO TRY TO ACCESS THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE OF THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING STATEWIDE. THEY'RE OFTEN HEARING THAT THAT- BUDGETS ARE TIGHT- SO TO SPEAK AND SO WE REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO TRULY REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND HOW CAN WE UPDATE THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL. AT THE TIME WE SPOKE WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF WE HAD ONLY RECEIVED ABOUT TEN COUNTY REPORTS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT WHICH. WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES HAS- HAS SENT US A- OUR THIRTY NINE. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REPORTS SO MUCH I THINK YOU KNOW BOTH REALITIES ARE TRUE IN THAT WE DID AT THE TIME THAT WE WORK WITH YOUR STAFF. FOR THIS COMMITTEE THERE WERE SOME DELAYS. AND ES DE PRODUCTOR 5% AS THE COUNTIES HAVE IMPROVE THE REPORTING H. U. S. HAS HAS REALLY TRIED TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS WE'RE IN PRIOR YEARS WE SAW- DELAYS THAT MIGHT HAVE LASTED A YEAR OR LONGER WE'RE SEEING. A MUCH QUICKER TURNAROUND. HOWEVER TO THIS AS OF TODAY AND WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FUND BALANCES ARE. AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. THE COMMISSION WILL EARN GENEROUS. OKAY THANK COMMISSION WILL HOLD A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE ON AS PART OF OUR MARCH TWENTY FOURTH. PUBLIC HEARING THE COMMISSION WILL WILL RECEIVE A PRESENTATION FROM ME ON THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL IN ITS STATUS- THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AT THIS POINT AND C. B. H. D. A. AND SO THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO ERROR DURING THAT MEETING ON THE TWENTY FOURTH. AND IT REALLY GETS THAT- KNOW HOW TO MOST APPROPRIATELY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE FUND BALANCES THE COUNTIES MAINTAIN WE DON'T DISPUTE THE COMMENTS OF DH YASSER CVH TA THAT MOST COUNTIES DO SPEND THEIR FUNDS WITHIN THE THREE OR THE FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME. THAT'S NOT IN DISPUTE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WIDE VARIATION IN HOW QUICKLY COUNTY SPEND THOSE DOLLARS AND CONCERNS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT COUNTIES THAT ARE RETAINING LARGE FUND BALANCES COULD USE THOSE FUNDS TO RESPOND TO THE VERY URGENT NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THAT. THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TODAY IS I THINK THE ISSUE OVER ACCESS TO DATA IS GETTING DRAMATICALLY BETTER AND WE MAY HAVE CAUGHT UP- I HAVEN'T CHECKED IN WITH MY STAFF TODAY BUT I KNOW DHS HAS BEEN WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE MOST UPDATED INFORMATION- BUT THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS OVER. THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE RELEASING INFORMATION ON AND FENCE FUND FUND BALANCES AS IT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED BY THE PUBLIC THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT. PLANNED FOR FUTURE EXPENDITURES AGAIN OUR CONCERN IS THE TENSION BETWEEN PLANNING FOR FUTURE EXPENDITURES AND ADDRESSING THE VERY URGENT CRISES THAT. WE'RE SEEING ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IF I COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND NOW THAT I BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE I THINK THE REASON I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HAD TURNED. THEIR EXPENSES WE PASSED THE MON DAMAGES SAYING I'M TO THE L. A. C. WE WORK TOGETHER REGULARLY ON THE TRANSPARENCY TOOL THAT. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE YES IN THE L. A. P. ON THE TRANSPARENCY TO ALL I THINK ARE QUITE MINOR AND AT THIS POINT TECHNICAL I THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT SHALL BE RAISED AS WE- ARGUE ONE OF FLAG IS THAT- WE ARE. COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE ALLIES FOLLOWED IN THE COUNTY G. USING THE FUNDS AND APPROPRIATELY WHICH MEANS THAT MANY OF THESE BONDS ARE LOCKED INTO. PLANNING-PROCESSES THAT CAN TAKE A YEAR TO DO AND THAT WE- AND THAT WE ARE NOT AT LIBERTY TO TELL COUNTIES HOW TO USE THAT FUNDING OUTSIDE OF LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS AND SO WILD. AND I'M SPEND FUND BALANCE COULD LOOK ALARMING IN REALITY ALL OF THAT FUNDING COULD BE ALLOCATED CONTRACTED ENCUMBERED AND USED FOR PRIORITIES THAT HAVE INDETERMINATE LOCALLY. AND COULD BE SPENT AB ACCORDING TO THE NHS A PRIORITIES AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WITHIN THREE YEARS THE LARGER COUNTIES IN FIVE YEARS FOR THE FOLLOWING COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE SEEN- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AN HSA FUNDS IS BEING SPENT VERY EARLY ON. AND WE ARE SEEING. THAT KIND OF PROBLEMS WE DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WHAT A PLEASE THE ARE. TO THE FOLLOW AND FOR THE- AS WELL TO HAVE THE- TURNED. AS WE FOR ALL DAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS AND- IF COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON LARGE RESERVES. I BELIEVE MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO ASK. TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK ON FASTER TIMELINES TO ADDRESS THE CRISES. THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO A QUESTION AND BE ABLE TO ASK- DR KELLY IF I COULD. IT IT SEEMS FROM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING YOU MADE A VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENT TO. FOCUS ON KEEPING IT LOCAL SO WE COULD WORK WITH EQUITY. THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU BELIEVE- BASED ON WHAT YOUR TESTIMONY IS TODAY WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE THERE ARE THOSE LARGE RESERVES AND- IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE JUST WENT THROUGH A PANDEMIC OR ANECDOTALLY WE'RE HEARING. ABOUT SPENDING DECLINING DURING THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND THE LIGHT OF. US HAVING INCREASED REVENUES. ARE ALL FUNDS CURRENTLY ENCUMBERED OR WILL THERE BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. FOR US TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH TO HELP TO DETERMINE HOW TO SPEND THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR OPINION ON THAT. THANK YOU- DOCTOR ON BLACK. AND SO. THAT THE DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING THAT IS THAT I KNOW THAT MY BUDGET I KNOW HOW IT IS BUDGETED I KNOW HOW IT'S ALLOCATED I KNOW HOW THAT WE WILL ENCUMBER AT ALL THAT IT WILL GO FORWARD. I CAN'T SPEAK TO EVERY COUNTY AND EVERY-COUNTIES PROCESS AS YOU KNOW IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE THING THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US IS THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAD THE FUNDING OUT FOR OUR PROVIDERS BUT- WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO ALL OF THE SERVICES WE NEEDED TO DO WE SHIFT INTO DOING TELEHEALTH WE WEREN'T DOING THE FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES BECAUSE WE WERE ON LOCKDOWN. AND THAT'S STILL SORT OF REMAINS SO THERE'S THAT IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK FORCE AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO BE FLIPPANT I AM SAYING IT BECAUSE IT'S TRUE THAT- OUR WORK FORCE NOT ONLY HAS IT SHIFTED BACK SOME OF OUR WORK FORCE DIED. AND SO THAT CHANGES THINGS THAT CHANGES THE WAY WE- GET SERVICES OUT ON THE STREETS AND WHEN I WAS AND- SIMPLY NOT COUNTY FOR ABOUT. THREE MONTHS I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH MY CONTRACTS BECAUSE EVERYONE OF MY CONTRACT STAFF WERE OUT IN A ROTATING BASIS MANY ARE AND THEN. I ON ON VENTILATORS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT SO I WOULD LIKE FOR US JUST TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE ARE NOT JUST THE PROVIDERS OF SERVICE ALL OF US BUT WE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO BEEN EXPERIENCING THE VERY SAME THING THAT ALL OF US HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING. AND SO THAT HAS SLOWED DOWN THINGS DO I THINK WILL BE UP AND RUNNING ABSOLUTELY DO I THINK THAT OUR FUNDS WILL BE ENCUMBERED ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT THERE ARE ALSO TO BE REAL- COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THEM. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I HAD LASTING SAMBAR DINO COUNTY FIVE EMPLOYEES WHO DIED OF KOBE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE IN SISKIYOU FIVE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE EVERYBODY. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN THE CONTEXT OUR GOAL IS TO GET SERVICES OUT ON THE STREET. WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY THREE PEOPLE AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE ARE HAND BY A BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEMS. HEY I CAN SAY THAT I THINK KNOWING THAT EVERYONE HAS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO APPROVE OR DON'TAPPROVE. OUR CONTRACTS AND HOW THEY MOVE. AND SO THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO MANAGE BUT WE ARE ALL TRYING AGAIN WE ALL WANT. TO HEAR OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND GET THE FUNDS OUT THE DOOR TO THEM. KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THIS HUGE CHALLENGE OF HOW WE DO BUSINESS AS A COUNTY AS A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. AND THAT'S NOT REAL. FLEXIBLE FOR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND SO WE WENT WE MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF AN HSA DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN GET IT OUT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN OUR MEDICAL SIDE OF THE HOUSE. BUT MY OPINION IS YES I DON'T THINK WE ARE SITTING ON A BIG DOLLARS. I WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM IT'S HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM SO. TO DIRECTOR EWING'S POINT AND THAT THE TRANSPARENCY DASHBOARD WHICH WHICH WE ARE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR UP AS LONG AS IT'S PUT IN CONTACTS SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO. ALLOCATE TO ENCUMBER WHAT THAT THE FACT THAT WE FLY WE HAVE THREE YEARS TO SPEND DOWN THE DOLLARS ON WHY WE WOULDN'T SPEND EVERY PENNY IN ONE YEAR. I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO ALL REMEMBER WITH THIS. THE DR KELLY IN A POWERFUL REMINDER OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES DOING THE HARD WORK THANK YOU FOR THAT. SEEING AS THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL SIX AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL. PANEL SEVEN ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE STATE OPERATION NEEDS.

AREAS FOR IN NEW INVESTMENT THAT THE FIRST IS TO ESTABLISH AN OUTCOMES FELLOWSHIP WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME ACADEMIC PARTNERS AND COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH PARTNERS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE WANT THE SYSTEM THIS THIS BROAD MIDDLE HEALTH SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS. OUTCOMES DATA ANALYTICS AND A STRONGER APPROACH TO EVALUATION WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR TEAM MEMBERS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE MOST EFFECTIVE USE. OF DATA HOW TO MAKE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF EVALUATION INFORMATION AND HOW TO DESIGN STRATEGIES INCLUDING FISCAL INCENTIVES TO REALLY BE OUTCOME FOCUSED AND SO WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU AT A LATER DATE WITH SPECIFIC. A SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO ACTUALLY BUILD OUT A PERFORMANCE SPACE OR OUTCOME FELLOWSHIP IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD THAT REALLY WOULD TARGET THAT OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERS AND OUR STATE PARTNERS THE PROPOSAL WE'RE ENVISIONING IS A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD LEVERAGE A SMALL AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING WITH PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING. TO LAUNCH A FELLOWSHIP THE COULD BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL AND WE THINK IT WAS VERY TIMELY GIVEN ALL OF THE ATTENTION THAT WERE HAVE THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING AND WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING AROUND UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE WORKING AND THOSE THAT ARE WORKING AND HOW WE CAN REALLY SCALE EFFECTIVE PRACTICES OVER TIME. THIS ISSUE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION IS THE ROLE OF TEARS- WITH THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNOR IN IN ADOPTING CARE CERTIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REALLY RECOGNIZE THE ROLE OF PEERS. IN OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH RECOGNITION THAT STATE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EMBRACED THE ROLE OF PEERS AS PART OF OUR STATE WORKFORCE. AND SO- WE'RE WHERE PEOPLE COME TO YOU WITH A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AT A LATER DATE AGAIN WE NEED TO WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THIS. BUT THE COMMISSION IS REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT F THE STATE IS GOING TO EMBRACE A ROLE FOR PAYERS THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE WORKFORCE ALSO EMBRACES THE ROLE FOR PEERS. PARTICULARLY IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT SO THAT WE CAN BEST UNDERSTAND THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR PEERS AND I'M FINE I WOULD COMMENTS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS EARLIER THAT YOU RAISED. AROUND THE ROLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS PEERS HOW CAN WE BRING PEERS IN THE STATE WORKFORCE WE CAN REALLY DESIGN THE SYSTEMS AND STRATEGIES. TO EMBRACE APPEAR ROLE THROUGHOUT OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM.

YOU KNOW. INCREASE CAPACITY AND WE'VE GOT THE QUESTION OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WELL EVERYTHING IS BEEN MOVED TOWARD EITHER KILL BIG- DIVERSION. OR A COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAM AND- GOOD FOR YOU A NEW PATIENT POPULATION THAT IS USUALLY HARDER TO TREAT AND MORE. VIOLENT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT- WITH EVERY SINGLE- HOSPITAL MINUS ONE- WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY VACANCY I THANK THAT- SO KIND OF TREATMENT WE CAN PROVIDE HELP THEY ARE WE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO THE PATIENT FEEL FREE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR HELP AND ARE THEY ABLE TO- COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO RECEIVETHAT TREATMENT- SO. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT NOT ONLY IS THE LARGE VACANCY RATE YOU KNOW. CREATING AN ISSUE WITH THE PATIENT TREATMENT IT ALSO CREEK CREATING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OVERTIME- I KEPT ARE AVERAGING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS OF OVERTIME PER QUARTER. AND THAT'S WORKED BY ONLY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED- THANK TECH. EXPECT THEM BACK TECHNICAL OUTLOOK QUOTED AND. AND OTHER- QUARANTINE ISSUES- THE VACANCIES HAVE EVEN GOTTEN LARGER SO THIS IS EXACERBATING THE ISSUE AND CREATING- A BIG CROP PRO PROBLEM- UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS KIND OF MOVED TO FILL- SOME OF THESE POSITIONS WITH- WITH A CONTRACT REGISTRY BETTER RECEIVING ANYWHERE FROM THAN THE STATE AFTER MAKING- THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF HIRING NEW STAFF IN STATE SERVICE SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT QUESTION CHAIR ARAMBULA- YOU KNOW WE HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE NOTICED THE IN THE BUDGET- THERE WAS NO BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ON THE- ON A RECRUITMENT RETENTION STATEMENT THAT CAP THIS PROPOSAL APARTMENT- WE HAD HOPED THAT THAT WOULD BE IN THERE- ANDWE HOPE THAT THIS- THIS COMMITTEE CAN.
