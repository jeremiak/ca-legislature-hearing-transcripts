00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.925
INTERESTED IN IS AN APPLES TO

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.327
APPLES COMPARISON SO THAT WE

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.096
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS AND THERE

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.366
WAS. MMHM CONDITIONALLY OUR OUR

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:50.203
COST OF LIVING INCREASES OR COLA

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.470
FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE THAT WAS

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.973
OVER 5% THAT WAS WHAT WAS IN THE

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.877
JANUARY TENTH BUDGET. AND THEN-

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.112
WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.216
BEEN MADE OR WILL BE MADE- IN

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.151
THE MAY REVISED JUST BASED ON

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.620
REVENUES. IT'S LIKELY TO GO TO

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.255
SOMETHING AROUND SIX AND A HALF

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:13.326
PERCENT AND THEN WHAT WAS JUST

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.662
DESCRIBED BY MR CABRAL. IS A

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.798
FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.067
FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.103
WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT. OF

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.206
SEVEN POINT 26% SO WHAT WE'RE

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.442
REALLY TALKING ABOUT WITH THOSE

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.245
DOLLAR AMOUNTS. YEAR TO YEAR

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:36.949
OVER LAST YEAR. IS NEARING

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.618
FOURTEEN PERCENTAGE THIRTEEN

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.420
POINT EIGHT TWO IN A IN A ROTH

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:43.456
PERCENTAGE SO. THIS IS REALLY

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.459
SIGNIFICANT AND WHEN WE HAD OUR

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.594
NINE HEARINGS IN FEBRUARY AND

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.997
INTO MARCH WE HEARD FROM

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.399
STAKEHOLDERS. THAT THEY WEREN'T

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:57.069
SURE THE 5% HELP THEM KEEP UP

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.705
AND I THINK THIS ARE WILL

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:02.475
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND WE ALSO

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:05.244
HAVE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ONE TIME

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.581
VERSUS. OUR ON GOING IN PROP

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:09.815
NINETY EIGHT AND THERE IS A TEN

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.752
BILLION ONE TIME CODE RELATED

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.488
LEARNING RECOVERY BLOCK GRANT

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:18.958
WHICH IS ON TOP OF THE COST OF

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.461
LIVING INCREASE I JUST DESCRIBED

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.264
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW. INDIVIDUAL

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.933
DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS THE

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:29.835
LEARNING LOSS AND SOME OF THE

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:30.736
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE FUNDED LAST

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.739
YEAR- WHEN WE DID THE SCHOOL RE

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.275
OPENING PLAN THERE WAS A LARGE

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.945
CHUNK OF LEARNING LOSS. THIS

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.347
ALLOWS THE ONE TIME GRANTS. TO

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.383
ADDRESS THAT AND TO PRESUPPOSE A

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.520
QUESTION FROM SENATOR MEN WHO IS

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:49.822
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.958
APPROPRIATE PERSON EARNERS BY

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:57.029
DOWN. THIS COULD BE USED FOR OUR

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.132
PENSION COSTS AT THE OF THE RAND

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:03.002
AND THE AND THE NEW ONCE WE FACE

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.871
IN ADDRESSING THE PENSIONS. IS

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:10.943
THAT. A PERSON STIRRERS. EXISTS

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.612
MAY BE IN ALMOST AN IDENTICAL OR

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:17.049
MAJOR WAY OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.018
OF NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE THERE

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.419
CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.788
DISTRICTS AND THE STATE. AND IF

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.191
YOU DO A PURSE BY DOWN THAT IS

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:28.260
WITH THE GENERAL FUND SURPLUS IT

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.862
APPLIES TO ALL THOSE DISTRICTS

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:33.699
AND WHEN YOU GET TO SCHOOLS IT

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.568
ISN'T AS BIG AS IT MIGHT BE AND

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.336
SO BY OUR- SCHOOLS THE

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.271
DISCRETION. TO DO THE LEARNING

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.040
LAWCENTER AND INCLUDE PENSION

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.210
COSTS IT'S A WAY OF DIRECTING

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.712
MONEY TRUST TO SCHOOLS. ARE OUT

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.147
FOR THEIR NEEDS BUT ALLOWING

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.715
THEM TO MEET THEIR PENSION

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.851
OBLIGATIONS SO IT IS A WAY OF

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.753
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE ALTHOUGH I

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.122
DO NOT WANT TO- FOR CLOSE ANY

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:59.225
FUTURE COMMENTS ON THIS BECAUSE-

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.793
I THINK THEY'RE STILL VERY

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.328
RELEVANT. AND THEN WE AND WE DO

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.097
THE ONE TIME OF GRANT BLOCK

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.298
GRANTS FOR ARTS MUSIC AND

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:10.202
TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SCHOOL

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.405
KITCHEN. R. AND LOCAL. FOR MEALS

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:15.708
IS ALSO A ONE TIME. AND THERE

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:22.381
HAVE BEEN CONCERNS- BUT THAT WE

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.150
IMPLEMENTATION FOR TRANSITIONAL

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.686
KINDERGARTEN- IF ANY OF US

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.288
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BASIC A

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.157
DISTRICTS THAT THEY WERE NOT

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.260
FUNDED FOR THIS. AND SO THIS

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:37.563
ALLOWS GRANTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.466
THAT BOTH BASIC AID AND NON

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.934
BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.037
ELIGIBLE FOR SO IS IT ADDRESSES

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.706
THAT ISSUE AND THIS ALSO COVERS

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.075
THE FIRST PART OF SCHOOL

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:52.478
TRANSPORTATION COSTS. SO THIS IS

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.682
A MAJOR POINT OF INVESTMENT AND-

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.752
I APPRECIATE ARE MR CABRAL'S- IN

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.053
ACTION BUT WANT TO PUT A FINER

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.123
POINT IN. ABI HAPPY TO STILL

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.524
COMMENT AT SOME POINT BUT I WANT

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.126
TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.828
ANY COMMENTS OR ASK ANY

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.297
QUESTIONS THEY HAVE. A CENTRO

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:14.266
TROUBLED- YOU'RE GOOD SHE'S GOOD

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.302
THAT MEANS SENATOR MEANT I THANK

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.636
SAID A FEW QUESTIONS AND

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.939
COMMENTS AS WELL- SO MISTER

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.640
CABRERA YOU JUST OF FOLLOW UP ON

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.709
CENTER LAYERS- QUESTION OR

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.711
COMMENT ABOUT COLA. ON THE

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.279
APPLES TO APPLES HOW MUCH WAS

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:31.484
THE INITIAL CALL INCREASE. AGAIN

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.718
WAS AT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:34.587
. THE TIMES I PROPOSED INCREASED

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:35.721
BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.156
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.391
THAT WAS A THAT WAS A FIVE POINT

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:41.026
33% OF THE COST OF LIVING

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.294
ADJUSTMENT I BELIEVE THE COSTS

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.729
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNT

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.764
NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.366
BUT I BELIEVE THE- WHERE THE

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.368
RANGE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.236
IF YOU BILLION I THINK I HAVE

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:51.971
TWO POINT THREE OR THREE POINT

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.639
EIGHT WRITTEN DOWN BUT BUT

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.608
SOMETHING IN THAT RANGE IN. THE

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:56.242
PROPOSED ELSE INCREASES THE L.

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:58.077
C. F. F. THAT WE ARE PROPOSING

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.612
THE STATE SENATE BUDGET IS-

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:02.982
LET'S SEE TWENTY TWO AND A HALF

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:05.284
BILLION OVER THREE YEARS. YES IN

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:07.419
TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF THE L.

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.355
C. F. ONE ITSELF IT WOULD BE IT

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.357
WOULD BE ADDING UP TO ON TOP OF

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:13.425
THE CALL WILL BE TEN BILLION

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.960
DOLLARS ON ONGOING. BASIS I GOT

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:17.229
AND I APPRECIATE THAT JUST

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.331
BECAUSE I DO HEAR FROM A LOT OF

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:20.566
TEACHERS. IN MY DISTRICT- THE

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.134
END THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.936
INCREASE WOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:25.604
COVERING INFLATION RIGHT NOW

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.640
GIVEN- THAT THE HIGH INCREASES

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:28.274
IN PRICES THAT WE'RE SEEING FOR

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.075
A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS SO.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.510
THIS SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.713
TIME TO PRUDENTLY. OPERATE

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.815
SUSTAINABLY INCREASE. THE AMOUNT

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.317
OF FUNDING GIVEN ESPECIALLY THE

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:39.118
CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:41.854
TEACHER RETENTION- TEACHER.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.256
RECRUITMENT EIGHT YOU KNOW DUE

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.058
TO THE COLD IN A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.294
FACTORS SO I APPRECIATE THAT I

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.395
APPRECIATE- CENTER LAYERS POINT

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:54.033
ABOUT- PROVIDING ACTUAL FUNDING

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.367
FOR I. T. K. FACILITIES BECAUSE

00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:56.168
THAT'S SOMETHING. NOT JUST BASIC

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:58.003
AID DISTRICTS BUT I THINK A LOT

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.939
OF. OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.607
NON BASIC AID DISTRICTS HAVE

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.575
EXPRESSED IS THAT THEY'RE

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.543
CONCERNED ABOUT WE'RE GONNA FIND

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.078
THE FUNDING TO EITHER BUILD

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.080
THESE THINGS FROM SCRATCH OR TO

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.082
CONVERT THEM- BASED ON EXISTING

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.517
FACILITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.018
A LOT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET EVEN

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:14.687
AT THE EXISTING CLASSROOM THAT.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:17.089
HAS THE SPACE. READY FOR YOUNG

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.758
CHILDREN IN THAT AGE RANGE. AS I

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:22.328
THINK THIS IS A VERY- IT

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:23.996
PREFERABLE APPROACH IN MY MIND I

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.131
GUESS I MAY HAVE A BIAS BECAUSE

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.033
I AM IN THIS BODY BUT- YOU KNOW

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.635
PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY TO THE

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:30.769
ELEVEN THOUSAND PLUS ELEAZAR WE

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:33.806
HAVE- TEACHING AYE AYE OVER

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:35.207
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR NEARLY

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:35.908
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND K.

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.810
THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS IN THE

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:38.310
STATE. I DIFFERENT LEDS

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.445
OBVIOUSLY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:42.514
AND PROVIDING BILL THE BUT IN

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.717
SORT OF GENERAL SILOS- FOR

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:47.052
SPECIFIC NEEDS AND I'M I'M GLAD

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.887
TO SEE THAT WE PRIORITIZE. THE

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.656
LCS THAT INCREASES BECAUSE I

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.258
THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.726
PLACE OR WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.261
FUNDING FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.630
THAT CENTER WHERE PROVIDES- I'M

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.531
ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE COVERT

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:01.567
RELATED. LEARNING RECOVERY BLOCK

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:03.936
GRANT BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.571
BIG NEED WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:06.805
AS STUDENTS RETURNING WE'RE

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:07.906
SEEING A LOT OF BEHAVIORAL AND

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.975
MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL ANXIETY

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:12.311
ISSUES- AT ALL AGE RANGES AND

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.612
AGAIN I HAVE THREE KIDS THEY

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.914
TALK ABOUT IT I TALK TO THEIR

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.750
TEACHERS I TALK TO THEIR

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:18.350
PRINCIPAL. HI EVERYONE TALKS

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.285
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:20.686
BROUGHT ON MICHAEL IN NINETEEN

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.522
AND THIS- BUDGET ACTUALLY- DOES

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.191
PRIORITIZE THESE THINGS SO- I AM
