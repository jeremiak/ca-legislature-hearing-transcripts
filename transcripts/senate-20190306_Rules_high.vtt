NEED TO BE MADE AND HE AND

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.131
SEVERAL AREAS MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:45.665
ARE.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.767

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.891
THOSE UP AND THOSE CAN COME IN

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.326

THAT CAN COME IN FROM.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.497
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY CAN

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.599
BE RAISED --

MORE THOROUGH AB --

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.752
ANALYSIS OF WHAT.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.053
ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.754
BUT BUT WHAT ARE THE

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.189
UNDERPINNINGS OF THE PROBLEM BUT

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.424
THEN ALSO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.025

THE TIME AND THE STAFF RESOURCES

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.006
AT TO TAKE THE MORE IN DEPTH

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:03.376
LOOK AT AM I ALSO AM OVERSEE AND

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.710
THE AUDIT AND EVALUATION

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.179

THE ISSUES ARE AND SOMETIMES

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.777
THAT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.845
FUNDING AND THAT'S OKAY WHEN

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.580
WE'RE SOLVING A PROBLEM FOR THE

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:42.415

APPOINTMENT WE'VE HAD THE HONOR

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.477
OF SERVING TOGETHER AND DISTINCT

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.913
CAPACITIES THE THE TOUGHEST ONE

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.348
I THINK WAS STARTING OUT DURING

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.184
THE RECESSION IN 200-082-0009

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.286
WHEN STATE LOST ABOUT THIRTY

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.755
BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:24.423
NEW ALWAYS MAINTAINED A SENSE OF

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.359
CONFIDENCE AS WE NAVIGATED

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:28.594
THROUGH AN I GOT THAT SAME

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.129
SENSITIVE.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.397
CONFIDENCE YESTERDAY WHEN WE

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.799
SPOKE -- A

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.835
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I THINK --

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.170
WORTHWHILE FOR FOR THE COMEDIAN

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.506
AND FOR THE PUBLIC --

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:42.008
MANY BELIEVE WE'RE HEADED

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.143
TOWARDS A DAY FOR A DROP NOT A

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.679
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE QUINN.

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:51.717
ON HOW DO YOU WANT HOW DO YOU

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.953
SLEEP AT NIGHT NOW --

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.056
HOW DO WE FORECAST HOW DO WE

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.924
PREPARE AND?

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.193
WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF CONFIDENCE

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.195
ABOUT OUR ABILITY.

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.431
TO WHETHER THAT DIP OR THAT

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.867
DROPPED IN THE FUTURE.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:10.269
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS I'D

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.805
AT M. BEING ABLE TO RESPOND IN A

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:14.874
BETTER WAY THAN THE LAST TIME WE

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.275
WORKED ON THE ON THIS ISSUE

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.077
BEFORE BY BY SETTING UP A RAINY

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:19.779
DAY FUND AND CONTINUING TO PUT

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.946
MONEY.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.948
INTO THAT FIND AT THE THIS IS AN

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.417
ISSUE THAT WAS FRONT AND CENTER

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.052
WHEN WE WERE BUILDING THE BUDGET

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.253
WITH THE GOVERNOR --

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.722
IS THE LACK AT THE TIME HI AND

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.757
THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE ALMOST TEN

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.359
YEARS AND TO THE CURRENT.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.461
FISCAL EXPANSION THAT'S THAT'S A

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.864
RECORD ANTICIPATING THAT THERE

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.266
WILL BE AT SOME POINT A SLOW

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.234
DOWN AND AND AND WE FORECASTED

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:43.702
EVEN MILD RECESSION COULD

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:45.604
RESULTS AND A SEVENTY BILLION

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.406
DOLLAR DROP IN REVENUES OVER A

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:48.507
THREE YEAR PERIOD SO THAT'S A

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.176
DAUNTING NUMBER.

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.343
ABSOLUTELY --

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.112
BUT THAT'S ALSO WHY WE'VE MADE A

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:54.914
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.615
JANUARY BUDGET IN WHAT WE CALL

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.184
BUDGET RESILIENCY IN THIS IS

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.952
THAT IT'S A COMBINATION.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.721
OF OF SEVERAL FACTORS ONE IS

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.123
CONTINUING TO BUILD RESERVES

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.558
HAVING THOSE RESERVES THAT ARE

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:08.661
SATISFIED IN THE RAINY DAY FUND --

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.696
FOR EXACTLY AT THAT AN ECONOMIC

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.832
SLOWDOWN IT'S NOT OUR OPERATING

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.500
EMERGENCY RESERVES THAT SET

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.570
ASIDE FOR WHEN WE ACTUALLY ARE

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:18.804
GOING TO NEED NEEDED.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.139
I'M AND THEN ALSO PAIN

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:21.674
CONTINUING TO PAY DOWN DEBTS AND

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.876
DEFERRALS SOME OF WHICH WERE

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.211
TAKEN OUT MANY YEARS AGO.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.379
AND THAT IS ALL GOING TO HELP US

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.381
I'M TO WHETHER ADD THAT THE

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.951
VOLATILITY THAT DOES EXIST IN

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.352
OUR REVENUE SYSTEM.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.187
I AND ALSO JUST THE

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.155
CORRESPONDING --

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.756
YOU KNOW I HAVE REQUIREMENTS

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:38.991
THAT WE HAVE ON THE EXPENDITURE

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.660
SIDE BOTH PROPOSITION --

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:42.528
NINETY EIGHT BUT ALSO MANY OF

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.896
OUR OTHER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:45.598
THAT DURING ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.032
SOMETIMES GROW AND NOT

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.400
APPROPRIATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:50.336
LOSING THEIR JOBS AND AND NEED

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:51.604
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.339
I'M SO THE COMBINATION OF THOSE

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.508
TWO THINGS DOES MAKE MANAGING

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.076
THE STATE'S FISCAL.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:13:01.614
I'M BALANCE THE A VERY VERY --

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.449
AND IT'S AND IT'S VERY FRAGILE --

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.817
THE STATE'S BALANCE AND SO I'M

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.852
I'M VERY GROUNDED AND THAT THOSE

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.188
BAD YEARS THOSE RECESSION YEARS.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.456
AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE MAKING

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:12.558
CHOICES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:16.095
SUSTAIN A OVER THE LONG RUN.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.196
THANK YOU --

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:20.366
AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK --

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:23.202
IN OUR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.337
YOUR AGENT SEEN IN THE

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:27.039
LEGISLATURE --

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:30.309
ANY EARLY WARNINGS OF CONCERN

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:30.943
THE MORE OF US THAT CAN WITHOUT

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.243
[inaudible]

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.912
WITHOUT.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:36.448
CREATING UNNECESSARY PANIC JUST --

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.750
ANY TRANS --

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.952
TENDENCIES WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.188
US TO KNOW THAT WELL.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.190
YES AND WE WILL BE UPDATING OUR

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.858
FORECAST FOR THE MAY REVISION

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:47.393
WHICH IS WE DO THE TWO TIMES A

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.428
YEAR AND THAT'S A IT'S REALLY

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.796
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WHAT

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.464
