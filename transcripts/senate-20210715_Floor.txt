THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER. IT SETS A PATH TO DEBT FREE COLLEGE FOR OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IT PUTS ADDITIONAL STIMULUS CHECKS DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. PROVIDES MORE GRANT FUNDS TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR NON PROFITS IN OUR ARTS INSTITUTIONS. AND IT MAKES TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE.

FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION OUT OF THE THREE FIVE YEAR TOTAL OF SIX BILLION FOR THE BROADBAND INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING. AND IT REMOVES EIGHT MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT I H. S. S.

CENTER SKINNER THE FORGERS. THANK YOU. SKEWS ME MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I HOPE YOU HAVE BEEN. I ANTICIPATING WITH EXCITEMENT THIS TRAILER BILL AS I HAVE. THIS IS OUR CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT TRAILER BILL MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS THAT IT PROVIDES RATE INCREASES FOR ALL CHILD CARE PROVIDERS NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. FOR WHICH THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS MET IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS TRAILER BILL BUT ALSO THOSE. WHO ARE NOT. AND IT FOLLOWS THAT READING CREASE FOLLOWS THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE STUDY THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED- IT ALSO WAVES THE CHILD CARE FAMILY FEES FOR THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. AND IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF. PLACEMENTS FOR TO HELP FAMILIES GET CHILD CARE WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT AND AS WE KNOW SO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS PRIMARILY MOTHERS BUT OTHERS HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING TO CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THERE ARE OTHER. TRAILER BILLS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH TODAY THAT PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORT THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW HOME TAKING CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE OF INTERRUPTIONS THAT OCCUR DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT THIS ONE IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT% WOMEN LEFT THE WORKPLACE IN THE LARGEST NUMBER AND IT IS THESE CHILD CARE EXPANSION AND THE PROVISION OF THE RATE INCREASES THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK TO WORK. AND THEN IT ALSO- INSURERS CONTINUED PROGRESS ON CHILD CARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM BY ESTABLISHING A RATE REFORM WORK GROUP- WITH DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER REPRESENTATION THAT WILL COME BACK OBVIOUSLY IN VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HARD. FOUGHT BY THE WOMEN'S POCKETS AS WELL AS THE STATE SENATE AND VERY- PROUD THAT WE HAVE IT BEFORE US TODAY AND URGED HER AYE VOTE. SENATOR LEYVA.

AND RATE REFORM ISN'T EASY WHAT WE WERE REIMBURSING OUT WAS 75% OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RATES OF THINK ABOUT THAT FIVE YEARS OLD NOW WE WILL BE REIMBURSING 75% OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR MORE WITH MONEY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT'S EVEN MORE MONEY TO OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND YOU YOU ASK WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THIS ALLOWS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON OUR CHILD CARE pMOST PRECIOUS THINGS OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN IT ALLOWS THOSE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO PAY CLOSE TO A LIVING WAGE SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS. INCREASE TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER FIVE YEAS BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT JUST L. A. COUNTY AND SAN MARINO COUNTY ALONE. NEED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS. SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO BUT WE SHOULD ALL CELEBRATE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY ENCOURAGING I WROTE AND I THINK EVERYONE AND I REALLY WANT TO THINK THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. BECAUSE LONG BEFORE I WAS EVER HERE IN THE SENATE THEY HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONING CHILD CARE. CHILD CARE RATES CHILD CARE SLOTS FOR WITH A CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE DID REALLY WELL THIS YEAR. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL BY THESE PEOPLE THESE WOMEN.

AND THAT IS YOU KNOW NOT KNOWING MY CAR STARTS AND KNOWING I HAVE GAS AND KNOWING I HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO TAKE MY CHILD SO I MEAN WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY ARE WORKING CLASS WOMEN OF COLOR IS JUST INCREDIBLE I THINK TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE SLOTS AND IS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS ALSO JUST THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR ALL THAT THE DEDICATION AND WORK. OVER THE YEARS THAT WE PUT INTO TRYING TO INCREASE THE SLOTS AND ALSO INCREASING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE BECAUSE WE KNOW IT DOES NO GOOD TO PROVIDE CHILD CARE FOR KIDS THE MOMS AND GO BACK TO WORK IN FOR MAKING OUR PROVIDERS LIVE IN POVERTY THEMSELVES SO I JUST WANNA CONGRATULATE EVERYBODY WHO DID ALL OF THIS WORK- AND JUST REALLY NOTE THAT THE HISTORIC NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO INVEST IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND OUR FUTURE LEADERS THANK YOU. SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU ARTS WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO. RISE AND PUT THIS. IN PERSPECTIVE THANKS TO THE WORK FOR THE CENTER FROM CHINO CENTER FROM BERKELEY EMINEM PRO TEM. THIS IS TRULY A HISTORIC BILL AND- HI AT FRAN ADVOCATES GOT MORE THINK SUMS IT UP HE SAID THIS WILL PUT. CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME THE BEST STATE IN THE NATION TO RAISE A CHILD FULL STOP THE BEST STATION STATE IN THE NATION TO RAISE A CHILD EVERY CHILD. ONE YEAR PRE K. MOST WELCOME CHILDREN GET LEAST TWO YEARS OF PRE K. PLUS THERE'S A STARK INCREASE IN INFANT TODDLER CARE. AND WITH THIS MEASURE TODAY WE GET OUR HARD WORKING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WORKFORCE A STEP TOWARDS A PROFESSIONAL WAYS THEY DESERVE IN MY DISTRICT ALONG WITH ME TO THIRTY PERCENT.

WORK ALL KINDS OF HOURS THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF JOBS SOME OF THEM HAVE ALL NUMBERS OF JOBS AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN OF ALL AGES AND THAT CONSTELLATION OF PARENTING REALITY IS WHY WE NEED A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND IT'S WHY WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE LICENSE EXAM THAT OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES THAT ARE CENTERS. CHILD CARE KEEPS CALIFORNIA WORKING AND PARENTS ARE NOT WORKING. AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN. IN PRODUCTIVITY IS STALLED. AND IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HARNESS. THE INNOVATION AND THE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE DRIVE THAT HAS COME TO DEFINE CALIFORNIA. THEN WE SHOULD BE. WAITING WITH BATED BREATH TO VOTE AYE ON THIS BILL AND CONTINUING TO DOUBLE DOWN ON CHILD CARE. THANK YOU. SENATOR LIMON. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL THAT ALLOWED OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS AT TO THE BARGAINING TABLE AND THAT WAS A BILL THAT CAME AFTER DCADES AND DECADES OF ATTEMPTS AND- ALSO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS NEVER STOPPED PUSHING- FOR DECADES AND DECADES AS A MOTHER OF A IN FANS WHO IS ON A SEVEN WAIT LIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR CHILD CARE CENTERS I KNOW THIS ISSUE IN A VERY DEEP AND PERSONAL WAY AND I KNOW THAT MANY MANY FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD CARE IS THE VEHICLE TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO GO TO WORK. AND SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT A HISTORIC BILL AND I DON'T WANT IT LOST ON US THAT IT'S BEEN DECADES IN THE MAKING BEYOND OUR TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EVEN THE BILL THAT WE AUTHOR THAT I AUTHORED AB TO ENSURE THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE UP WITH A BILL THAT MANY- AUTHORED PRIOR TO ME AND WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A INCLUDING OUR PRO TEM SO I THINK THAT TODAY'S A BILL IS A HISTORIC ONE AND IS AT MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING. THIS EFFORT- AND EVERYONE ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S HISTORIC BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE FULL CALIFORNIA PROBLEM WE STILL HAVE THE NEED FOR MANY MORE HUNDREDS OF HOUSING CHILD CARE SLOTS WE HAVE THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR ARE PAID A SALARY THAT IS COMMENSURATE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPACE- AND WE STILL HAD THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE THINK OF CHILD CARE- BEYOND A BABY SITTING OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT TIME- AND THEIR ROLE IN A CHILD'S LIFE. IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT. SO WITH THAT I HOPE THAT WE ALL THE HI. ANY FURTHER TO. OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. THING MAN CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS THIS IS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL AND IT DOES AGAIN SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT THINGS INCLUDING A VERY A LARGE EXPANSION OF FINANCIAL AID INCLUDING ALLOWING CAL GRANTS TO BE ELIGIBLE TO OUR- TWO STUDENTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE HAD A RESTRICTION ON CAL GRANT SO THAT IF YOU WERE HAD. A NUMBER OF YEARS PAST HIGH SCHOOL YOU ARE OVER A CERTAIN AGE WHEN YOU RETURN TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE EITHER IN ORDER TO GET THAT A DEGREE OR TO INCREASE YOUR JOB SKILLS YOU COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED BY OUR CAL GRANT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. THIS EXPERIENCE THAT ELIGIBILITY ALLOWS AND RECOGNIZES THAT OUR ECONOMY IS CHANGING DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE NOW THE ONES THAT REALLY HAVE THE JOB GROWTH AND THE AND MANY PEOPLE NEED TO RETURN. WE CAN IMPROVE THOSE JOB SKILLS IT ALSO PROVIDES. GIVE ME CAL GRANTS TO STUDENTS WHO ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. ALLOWING IT TO COVER NON TUITION COSTS AND EXPANDS. CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM TO HELP COVER THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AT OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. WHICH WILL ALLOW MANY MORE OF OUR FAMILIES TO NOT HAVE TO RELY ON CITY LARGE STUDENT LOAN DEBTS- THERE'S OTHER GREAT THINGS IN THIS BILL BUT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. IN SOME CENTER NEARBY IN. I HAVE THAT MEMBERS OF THE DESK. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE REACH PLEASE READ THE AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR NIELSEN STUCK ONE. BARBARA THE LADYDOWN THE SENATE THESE AMENDMENTS I AND I THINK THAT IT IS AN OVERSIGHT. BUT THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD INCLUDE THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND.

I UNDERSTAND IT WE'VE GOT A PROCESS AND- WE WANT RESPECT THAT PROCESS BUT I HOPE THIS CAN BE LOOKED INTO. SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THIS TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT'S IN THIS TRAILER BILL IT IS THE RESULT OF FIVE MONTHS OF INTENSE WORK AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATORS FROM YOU HI POWER AND IRVINE AND THE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST BUDGET FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN MODERN TIMES AND THE BACKDROP IS WHAT'S NOT IN THE TRAILER BILL IT IS WHAT WE DID IN THE MAIN BUDGET BILL WE ALREADY APPROVED BECAUSE IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DIDN'T EVEN RESTORE HIGHER EDUCATION TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THE STIMULUS- THAT HAPPENED A FEW WEEKS LATER RESTORED THE BUDGET TO WORK WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THE BUDGET WE APPROVED AND SENT TO THE GOVERNOR DOES A 5% COST OF LIVING INCREASE TO THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. THAT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THEN IT ALLOWS US TO DO EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THIS TRAILER BILL THERE THIRTY NINE ITEMS BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT FIRST IT PAYS OFF THE DEFERRALS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE THE DEFERRALS ARE DONE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION OUT OF THIS AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR. IT REVOLUTIONIZES STUDENT NAY WITH BOTH CAL GRANT AND THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND IT IS REALLY ABOUT OVER THE SHORT TERM ADDING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS TO FINANCIAL AID FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND POTENTIALLY OVER TIME MORE THAT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT JUST AS WITH THE pCHILD CARE BILL TRAILER BILL WE JUST ADOPTED THIS WILL MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT IS REALLY ABOUT MOVING TO A DEBT FREE CALL COLLEGE X. IT'S- NOT. A FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE A DEBT FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THE PREVIOUS ROLES WERE REALLY DESIGNED TO LIMIT PEOPLE ONE FINANCIAL AID REENTRY STUDENTS WEREN'T INCLUDED- DEPENDING ON YOUR GRADES OR OTHER THINGS YOU WEREN'T INCLUDED. THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE SCHOLASTICALLY ELIGIBLE AND REALLY HAVE A SHOT AT MAKING SOMETHING OF YOURSELF THE STATE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU IN THAT PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A PROPOSAL HERE. OR THERE IS AN ACTION HERE BASED ON THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL TO RESERVE MORE SPACES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR IN STATE STUDENTS AND IT REALLY TARGETS THE THREE CAMPUSES WHERE THAT ISSUE IS MOST PRESENT AND THE GREAT THING IS WE ARE FUNDING ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT IN THIS BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO IT MAKES IT EVEN EASIER FOR STATE SPACES FOR IN STATE STUDENTS. AND WHETHER IT'S OUR TEACHER TRAINING OR FOR OTHER THINGS THIS BUDGET MAKES A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD TO VOTE FOR I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. IN IRAQ. THANK MATTER PRESENT COLLEAGUES HODGES TO OF I WANT TO FIRST SAY I. PRECIADO IN SUPPORT THIS A GREAT BUDGET AND FRANKLY THE FOLKS WHO WORKED ON IT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE- SPENT A FEW YEARS- IN THE SUB TRENCHES OF WORKING ON BUDGETS AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO DO THAT WOR AND- IT WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT THIS YEAR DESPITE THE FACT. THAT WE HAD A BUNCH OF MONEY TO WORK WITH OFTEN THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. NOT EASIER I JUST WANT TO JOIN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA WHO IS SOMEWHERE YEAR. WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVEN. STATE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THE STATE SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN SCHOOLS THAT- TIME FOR GOD. WELL THERE ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. SCHOOLS THAT- GET LOST IN THE- BUDGET DANCE BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY HAVE NO CONSTITUENCY UNLIKE HER. KEY THROUGH TWELVE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I HOPE AT SOME POINT IN TIME AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REMAINDER OF THIS BUDGET. WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE- CONCERNS ECHOED BY MY- COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO DO. DID INTRODUCE THAT- THAT MOTION I AGREE WITH THE DECISION ON THE MOTION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THOSE. ISSUES AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND I. SUSPECT I SPEAK FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM FREMONT AS WELL THANK YOU. CENTERMAN THANK YOU- I RISE TO FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA CRUZ FOR HIS HARD WORK- AS PART OF THE BUDGET SUB ONE COMMITTEE- WE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WORKING ON THIS BILL AND THIS BUDGET- I ALSO JUST WANT TO ECHO HIS COMMENTS AND POINT OUT THAT THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE ECONOMY- AND SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BUDGET THAT I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT IS ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE I THINK YOU CAN DRAW A DIRECT LINE FROM OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND ROBUSTNESS THE UNIQUELY RESILIENT NATURE OF OUR ECONOMY. AND THE PAST INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE IN INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS YES USE AND THE UC'S- AND IF WE NEGLECT THOSE INSTITUTIONS GOING FORWARD OUR ECONOMY WILL WITHER IN OUR FUTURE AND SAID I'M REALLY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS- AND I URGE EVERYONE VOTE AYE. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES OF THE SENATE I ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY TWO I KNOW THAT TOP COLLEGE IS JUST A DREAM AND SO MANY OF OUR INNER CITY COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THIS BILL JUST REALLY MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE CONSIDERING WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC EVERY. YOU KNOW HAVE ACCESS TO CALTRANS THAT PERHAPS HAVE TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO REINVENT THEMSELVES AND PERHAPS CHANGE CAREERS BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED THIS LAST YEAR BUT I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED THAT- WE'RE INVESTING IN THINGS LIKE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEMS TO TRACK THE PROGRESS OF STUDENTS I ALSO WORKFORCE TRAINING EMPLOYMENT HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH WILL HELP THEM NAVIGATE THROUGH THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CAREERS ALSO I'M REALLY JUST ENCOURAGED BY WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRO TIME. ODD INTERROGATOR SHIP THAT MINISTRATION AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE BUDGET BOB THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN FUTURE YEARS WITHOUT AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE AS WELL THANK YOU. SENATOR ALAN. I WANT TO THANK THEM CENTER WHERE FOR HIS COMMENTS AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO JOIN IN IN PRAISE OF THIS BILL THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD STUFF IN HERE THINGS THAT MEMBERS THAT WORK ON FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM IT'S GOING TO HELP BETTER I TRACK THE PROGRESS OF OUR STUDENTS AND ALSO THE GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM- PFAFF THAT SUPPORTS INSTITUTIONAL AID FOR ALL THE THREE MAJOR HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DO EMISSIONS PATHWAYS A MAJOR EXPANSION OF CAL GRANT. THIS BILL MEMBERS IS GOING TO DO A LOT TO GET OUR STATE BACK ON TRACK TOWARD OPENING UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALSO FOLKS ARE COMING BACK FOR SECOND CHANCES IT AT A HIGHER EDUCATION- IT'S A IT'S A THERE THERE'S INCREDIBLY GOOD STUFF IN HERE AND I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT- IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP GET ARE YOU SEE BACK ON TRACK I TOWARD THE- TOWARD EXCELLENCE SO- PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL. SENATOR BATES YEAH. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LET ME OUT OF MY DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE ON MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVED ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET CHAIR SO WHEN WE RAISE THESE ISSUES CONSIDER THAT THOSE OF US WHO WERE NOT PART OF THAT PROCESS. OFF SOMEWHAT IN THE DARK ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION BILL THE THING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE THAT TROUBLING AND IT IS THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN UC SCHOOLS AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU A STORY I IN MY DISTRICT- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC I WAS VISITED BY THREE STUDENTS ARE THE PLAN MAY I MENTION THAT THESE ARE STUDENTS SUB. OF COLOR ARE WHO WERE ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO THEY HAD A CAL GRANT IN THE UNIVERSITY WAS MATCHING THAT THESE YOUNG LADIES COULD. ATTEND THAT SCHOOL. NOT ALLOWING. THAT CALGARY THESE THREE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION. BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITHIN HALF OF THAT THE TIME GIVEN THEIR AGE AND WHEN THEY WERE SEEKING ADMISSION. SO I'D LIKE US TO CONSIDER. I KNOW THAT'S NOT. POTENTIAL TODAY. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT THE CAL GRANT SCHOOLS HAVE PROVIDED WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE. A VERY FUNDAMENTAL BASE OFFER STUDENTS. YOU KNOW ACROSS THE BOARD. AND WHEN OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE IMPACTED AND THAT IS A YEAR IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSFER FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MAYBE THE ONLY SCHOOL THAT THE OPEN WOULD BE A UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO WHICH HAS A ROBUST OUR SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL FOUNDATION. FROM PEOPLE WHO WENT THERE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THAT SO. THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. AS WE GO FORWARD AND TODAY I CAN GO LAY OFF THIS JUST TO MAKE MY POINT. BUT AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK IF IT'S DIFFICULT TO HIT EVERY SINGLE ISSUE. BUT THIS ONE CAUGHT MY EYE BECAUSE- IT WAS SO INSPIRING I TO BE SITTING WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN. WHO FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN NOT HAVING A CAL GRANT WOULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO. A VERY ODD SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSITY AND IN OUR STATE THANK YOU. FOR ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. BEING NINE SENATOR SKINNER MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ONE- JUST WHITE CORRECTION IN REFERENCE THAT ARE- COLLEAGUE. I JUST MADE IS THAT- THE CAL GRANTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR MORE THAN JUST THE UC SYSTEM THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR CSU UC COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ON AN ON THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IF LANGUAGE IN THIS TRAILER BILL INADVERTENTLY. EXCLUDES ANY STATE. INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE CAN ADJUST THAT IN AUGUST NOW ONE ONE DISADVANTAGE OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE IS THAT IF AND IF THERE WAS AN INADVERTENT EXCLUSION. THEN WE COULD PRIOR TO THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE HAVE AMENDED IT SAY ON THE FLOOR. BUT WITH THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE WE CANNOT AMEND ON THE FLOOR AND IF WE WERE TO DELAY THE ACTION ON THIS TRAILER BILL THEN THE OTHER PROVISIONS WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT SO. THE THESE ADJUSTMENTS IN CALGARY AND TO MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP ALL OF THAT ARE EFFECTIVE RIGHT AWAY IN SO SOME STUDENTS WHO OF COURSE WILL START SCHOOL SOON MAY HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE- IN FACT MODIFIED. BUT THEY WOULD NOT IF WE DID NOT ACT UNTIL AUGUST NOW THE BILL HAS BEEN INFERENCE SB VERSION OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT FOR WEEKS. THE AB VERSION HAS BEEN IN PRINT FOR LESS THAN WEEKS BUT A NUMBER OF THE MORE THAN A NUMBER OF DAYS. AND SO THE BENEFIT OF IT IN PRINT IS IF SUCH THINGS ARE COSTS AND WE CAN BE ALERTED IN THE TIMELY MANNER THAN WE CAN IMAGINE. SO STAFF WILL OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT THAT WHAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO AMEND TO DAY BECAUSE THEN WE COULD NOT ACT SO. I WOULD NOT DELAY THE OTHER GREAT PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY MANY FOLKS ON THE FLOOR AND I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS THIS HUMAN SERVICES TRAILER BILL AB ONE THIRTY FIVE- MAKES AN INCREASE TO OUR GRANTS FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS AND- AS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS PRIMARILY MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN. IT ALSO AUTHORIZES A ONE TIME FLAT RATE PAYMENT FROM THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FINE TO EACH CAL WORKS ASSISTANCE UNIT. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY I THINK IN WHEN I WAS START TALKING. IN THE CHILD CARE ITEM ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE STILL NOT RETURNED TO WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT OTHERWISE BEFORE WERE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY SOMEONE ELSE. THIS BILL PERMANENTLY REPEALS THE 7% REDUCTION IN SERVICE HOURS FOR THE IN HOME. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AND OF COURSE BY ECSTATIC EXPANSION AND WE HAVE. FOLKS THAT NEED CARE. WE CAN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF- IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR AN AGE BASED TARGETED EXPANSION TO ELIGIBILITY FOR OUR CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

THIS WE'RE GONNA LOSE TWO MONTHS WORTH OF BEING ABLE TO FIND PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY SEQUEL READY ON THE GROUND THERE ARE CD'S AND FIRE SAFE COUNCIL SO I JUST WANT TO BE ON THE RECORD THAT. I'M NOT GOING AWAY I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BEAT UP ON THIS UNTIL WE GET OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS FUNDED I KNOW THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THIS MANY TIMES BUT I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW. I'M WATCHING AND WE NEED TO GET THESE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND SOONER THAN LATER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME. SENATOR NELSON. BARBARA THE LADY IN THE- OF THE SENATE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE IS THAT THE MONIES FOR FILE FOR AN WILD LAND CLEAN UP AND PROTECTION WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WITH THE FIRES BECAUSE WE'VE ALLOWED FOR DECADES THE FUEL. TO ACCUMULATE. HOWEVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET. IS SUBJECT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DETERMINING IF QUOTE NEEDED. I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE THEM THAT AUTHORITY. TOO OFTEN THIS LEGISLATURE FEEDS TO THE LEAD TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OUR FLOORING WE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO SAY WHERE THAT MONEY IS. SPENT IN A DISCLOSURE BY A PUBLIC- RADIO SYSTEM THEY DID A STUDY OF MONIES THAT WE HAD APPROPRIATED OVER A YEAR AGO FOR FORCING WILDLAND CLEANUP. IT DID NOT GET SPENT. AND WE'VE GOT FIRES RAGING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA NOW NOW WOULD THAT HAVE THE EXPENDITURE OF THAT MONEY HEALTH. PROBABLY AT LEAST IN SOME AREAS I GUARANTEE YOU IT WOULD HAVE THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT WE OUGHT NOT TO CEDE. OUR AUTHORITY AS LEGISLATORS REPRESENTING THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY WE HAVE APPROVED IN THE BUDGET. HURTADO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AT TODAY I RISE IN RELUCTANT OPPOSITION TO SB ONE FOUR EIGHT- THIS BILL PROVIDES ME THE FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE DROPPED BUT IT MAKES IT INTO THE HANDS THAT NEED IT THE MOST. AND THIS YEAR I HAVE WORKED HARD TO ENSURE THAT WE MAKE NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TO BETTER PREPARES FOR FUTURE DROUGHT YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY IT ALSO INCLUDES AN INCREASE THE INCREASE IN THE FEE CAP CHARGE PER BARREL OF OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS EXPENSE COLLECTION OF THE FEE TO RENEWABLE FUELS AND LINKS THE FEE TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. AS PEOPLE IN OUR STATE ARE STILL RECOVERING PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY FROM THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AS WE ARE ENTERING WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE DEVASTATING DROUGHT. THAT WILL IMPACT ARE CONSTRUCTED CONSTITUENTS ACCESS TO WATER. AN INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE FOOD I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE FOR A MEASURE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADD TO THE BURDEN. THANK YOU. FEDERATE HOUSEKI. THE COMMANDER OF PRESIDENT SO TO REFRESH EVERYONE'S MEMORY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR EARLY ACTION WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IN THIS BODY AND THE WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON SEPT TWO. AUGMENTED THAT BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS WITH THE GOVERNOR WAS TALKING ABOUT. FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION THAT MONEY. IS WHAT THE GOOD WORK IN THE BUDGET CHAIR AND THE STAFF. IS OUT THE DOOR. THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY GOT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD AND YES THAT MONEY HAS BEEN TIED UP. WE TOOK A ACTION IN THIS BODY RECOMMENDATION FOR THE BOOK WITH THE BUDGET. THAT WE WOULD BE SPENDING AN EXTRA BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS THAT NUMBER NOW STANDS WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HAT WE TALK ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX. THAT NEEDS TO BE PROGRAMMED OUT AND WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE LOUD AND CLEAR THAT SOME OF OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE NOT PUSHING THE MONEY OUT IN GETTING THE WORK TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE FIRE COUNCILS. AT THE CONSERVANCY'S AT THE REGIONAL PARKS AT THE STATE PARK SO. MY COMMITMENT IS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. MANY OF THE PACKAGES THE CLIMATE PACKAGE BEFORE THE YEARLY FIRE. PREVENTION PACKAGE. THE CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE ARE UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT MAKE IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TODAY BONTA ON JULY FIFTEENTH WE WILL CONTINUE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE WE DO HAVE PIECES HERE FONG AS WE CAN AS WELL AS THE DROUGHT PACKAGE THERE ARE SOME PIECES HERE TO DROP PACKAGE BUT THERE ARE PIECES THAT REMAIN THAT WE HAVEN'T. WE HAVEN'T WORKED ON IT'S NOT EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY ANTICIPATED AND RESOURCES EVERYTHING STILL IN PLAY. AS FAR AS THE SENATE'S SINCE PRIORITIES- BUT MANY MUCH OF THE WORK THAT GOT OUT EARLY HAS BEEN DONE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS WE WANTED TO BUT LOT OF THE FIRE PREVENTION OF FUNDS THAT GOT OUT.

REALLY IMPROVED SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS IT IMPLEMENTS THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE TO ENSURE AN INNOVATIVE AND PREVENTION BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH TWENTY FIVE AND YOUNGER. IT ALSO ADDS NEW HEALTH EQUITY AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT. IT IMPLEMENTS OUR MEDIC CAL CAL AYMAN ISSUE TO WHICH WILL TRANSFORM THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM. TO RE ORIENT IT TOWARDS A WHOLE PERSON CARE APPROACH THAT TARGETS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IT REDUCES HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES. IT EXPANDSFULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE AGE FIFTY AND OVER. BEGINNING ON MAY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT PHASES OUT THE ASSETS TEST TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDI CAL FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. I'M AN EXPERIENCED POSTPARTUM MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY FROM SIXTY DAYS UNTIL TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE END OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S PREGNANCY. AND ESTABLISHES THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WHICH WILL AWARD GRANTS OR OTHERWISE BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE A FULL CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH. FACILITIES OR RESOURCES FOR MOBILE CRISIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACUTE INPATIENT BEDS AND THEN IT. UPDATES OR MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT TO SUPPORT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION THAT WE GAVE IN THE BUDGET ACT FOR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHICH WE KNOW. NOT JUST THE SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH POLAR PARTNERSHIPS BUT ALL OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ITEMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED RIGHT NOW IT WE'VE KNOWN THAT WE THAT THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME. ACCESSING SERVICES AND WE'VE SEEN IT THAT MUCH MORE DISSED IN HANDS DURING THIS PANDEMIC YEAR WHERE MANY MANY OF US WERE CHALLENGED IT WAS THE TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD CHALLENGE ALMOST ANYONE'S MENTAL HEALTH BUT WITH THAT SCENE IT'S SO APPARENT THAT WE NEEDED TO FIX NOT ONLY EXPAND THE SERVICES BUT REVISED THEM SO THAT THEY- ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE FOR EXAMPLE IT SCHOOLS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB ONE THIRTY THREE. CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM SPEAKER I JUST ALSO WANT TO STAND AND BRYSON IN STRONG SUPPORTOF THIS BILL THIS IS AND WE'VE ALSO A THOUSAND TIMES WITH THANKS THANKS TO THE-BUDGET STAFF AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKED. SO HARD ON THIS AND AS WELL AS ALL OF THE ADVOCATE TO REALLY LET US KNOW LOUD AND CLEAR THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS OF HEARINGS- WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF THE COMMUNITY- SO IT IT IS JUST AND JUST WANT TO SAY LIKE AS A SOCIAL WORKER TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THE ASSET TEST SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THEIR LAST DOLLAR SPENDING DOWN. TO THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR HEALTH CARE IS JUST INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS INCREDIBLE THAT WERE ABLE TO DO. AND YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK A LOT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A CONTINUUM OF CARE WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE BED SPACE AND FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO BE- BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT AS EXCITING TO TALK ABOUT ACTUAL BED SPACE FOR PEOPLE BUT IF WE DON'T PROVIDE. THAT AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HOUSED IN STATE AND GET TREATMENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE CRISIS THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS THAT'S GOT TO BE THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM SO HAVING MONEY TO ACTUALLY BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AS WELL AS BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH OUR MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A POLICE OFFICER SHOW UP AT A LOT OF PLACES WHERE IT SHOULD BE. SOMEBODY WHO IS MORE PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THIS MONEY THIS TO CONTINUE OF CARE EXPANSION WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS. MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS WEKEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE. SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE ON HIS WORK ON BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT YOU BE I I THERE FOR FOSTER KIDS AND REALLY SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE THINGS THEY DIDN'T SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO NOW REPLICATE THAT.

WOMAN FROM RIVERSIDE WHO JUST- QUIETLY SOBBED AND SOBBED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS NOW GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE HAD WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR DECADES AND ALL THE ILLNESSES THAT CAME FROM THAT HARD WORK AND YET SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN A WAY THAT PREVENTED IT- FURTHER- DETERIORATION IN HER HEALTH- AND I. THINK OF HER AS WE TAKE THIS VOTE HOW THERE WILL BE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE ON MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD. AND NOW WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE. FIELD I THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND I AS FOR MY BOOK. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I REALLY WANNA PERSONAL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES WHO I KNOW HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR- FOR THESE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FOR SO MANY YEARS-TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE ABLE TO BE TREATED LIKE. FULL HUMAN BEINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN IN THIS COUNTRY- AND THIS IS THE- HAS A HUGE STEP FORWARD- I ALSO JUST WANNA. ON TO SAY THAT THE PHASING OUT OF THE ASSET TEST. I THINK IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE IN VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THIS CHAMBER HAVE WORKED OVERTIME. IN VARIOUS- AREAS TO TRY TO GET RID OF THIS INCREDIBLY. AFARIA SEN DESTRUCTIVE ASSET TEST. WHICH GIVES A HUGE INCENTIVE. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE ON PUBLIC BENEFITS NOT TO SAVE MONEY. NOT TO EVEN HAVE A CAR THAT'S YOU KNOW GOD FORBID IS NOT FALLING APART BECAUSE OF GOD FOR BID YOU SAVE SOME MONEY FOR YOUR KIDS EDUCATION OR FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF A YOU KNOW GOING TO BANKRUPTCY IF YOU GET SICK. YOU'RE GONNA GET KICKED OFF A PUBLIC BENEFITS ITS EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WE NEED TO EMPOWER PEOPLE TO BE STABLE THEIR LIVES. AND INTO LIFT THEMSELVES WITH HELP OUT OF POVERTY IN THE ASSET TEST KEEPS PEOPLE IN POVERTY SO I'M JUST THRILLED THAT WE'RE TAKING A DECISIVE STEP FORWARD TO GET RID OF THAT TERRIBLE TEST THANK YOU. SENATOR PENN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO ARISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF- THIS- BUDGET TRAILER BILL I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE READY MADE NOTE OF MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THIS BILL AND WE HEAR THE SENATE HAVE- WORKED HARD TO BUILD ON- THE FEDERAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO EXPAND ON IT TO EXPAND COVERAGE- YEAH I'VE OFTEN SAID. COVERAGE IS CERTAINLY ESSENTIAL AND VERY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH IN ITSELF SO IT ALSO MAKE NOTE IN ADDITION TO THE EXPANSION COVERAGES- THE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS WE SEE IN THIS TRAILER BILL WE ARE ALSO BOLDLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. HOW DO WE IMPROVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN FOR OTHER POPULATIONS HOW DO WE IMPROVE OUR CARE FOR THE ELDERLY NOW I WILL SAY THAT- SAMPLE TO CALAIS MA'AM- THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH- WE ARE MAKING AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT BUT THEY'RE STILL ONGOING WORK WE ARE GOING HAVE TO DO. HERE IN THE SENATE AND AS LEGISLATURE TO BE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS THIS- THEY'VE BEEN PROPOSED. ARE GONNA BE EXECUTED NO WAY- THAT IS EFFECTIVE- THAT THAT WE PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP BECAUSE OF WITHOUT RESOURCES WE CANNOT BEGIN THIS WORK. SO I MAKE NOTE OF BOTH OUR INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING PASS PROGRAMS EXPANDING COVERAGE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO TAKING STEPS. TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE COVERAGE BACKSEAT IMPROVE THE VERY COVERAGE PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE. AND FOR THAT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT- EVERYONE HERE CAN VOTE FOR THIS TRAILER BILL AND WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK AND TRYING TO BE SURE WE IMPROVE CARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

CENTERS CANADA FOR YEARS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AB ONE FIFTY THREE IS OUR CHILD WELFARE TRAILER BILL. AND THIS BILL THAT YOU MAY HAVE SO FAR DETECTED MY ENTHUSIASM FOR THE BILLS THAT WE ARE VOTING ON TODAY AND THIS ONE I AM PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT. BECAUSE IT WILL END. CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICE OF SENDING SOME OF OUR FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE TO OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS. I'M SURE SOME OF YOU HAVE READ WITH HORROR THE MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES OUT OF STATE ANY ABUSE THAT THOSE CHILDREN SUFFERED. AND ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT BACK TO CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. BUT WE STILL HAD IN- IN STATUTE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE RETURNS TO FACILITIES OUT OF STATE. AND THIS BILL WILL. ENSURE THAT AS OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND REQUIRE THAT ALL YOUTH B. IN CALIFORNIA BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT ALSO MAKES STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT WHICH INCLUDES EXERCISING OUR OPTION TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR APPROVED PREVENTION SERVICES. END OF THE SHOW WHICH IS A FIVE YEAR CHILDREN'S CRISIS CONTINUING PILOT PROGRAM. AND THEN AS ANOTHER FIRST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT PARK BEGINS. EIGHT GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM WHICH CITIES OR COUNTIES COULD APPLY FOR CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT WANT TO DO THIS. TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO THAT WOULD GIVE GUARANTEED INCOME PAYMENTS TO PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS NOW THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE PRIORITIZE FOR THAT. ARE YOUTH THAT ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF FOSTER CARE AND PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS SO FAR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS JUST LAUNCHED SUCH A PROGRAM OAKLAND AND STOCKTON HAVE PILOTED. AND THIS. THIS TRAILER BILL AND OUR BUDGET ACTION WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE. TO IN EFFECT ALLOW ANY CITY OR COUNTY TO APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS AND SET UP SUCH A PILOT. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER WALK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. IN THE AT I RISE ACTUALLY IN IN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- MY PARTICULAR DISTRICT IN L. A. COUNTY- I- I HAVE SHE'S A PARTIAL PART IN L. A. COUNTY BUT- ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH IN L. A. COUNTY RESIDES IN MY DISTRICT. I MYSELF AN ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME. TALKING IN MENTORING WITH FOSTER YOUTH IN WHICH I'VE DONE A LOT O LEGISLATION ON FOSTER YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE- THE STATS FOR FOSTER YOUTH ARE DEVASTATING. THEIR HALF AS LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THEIR CHANCE OF GRADUATING FROM A C. ISSUE ONLY ABOUT 4% DO THAT. MAYBE TALK TO CDC ARE THEY DON'T HAVE HARD FACTS BUT THEY BELIEVE IT. IS IN MANY AS FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL WE CAN. TO LET THIS LEFTY SO YOUNG PEOPLE OUT. I DO THOUGH- THROUGH THE CHAIR HAVE A HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SHE HAD MENTIONED. IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME. PILOT PROJECT THIRTY FIVE GOING TO GET THAT. AND IT SAYS PRIORITIZE. FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND FOR AND FOR PREGNANT YOUTH I'M WONDERING. THAT SAYS PRIOR PRIORITIZE ARE THERE ANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS AT THAT WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UNIVERSAL. INCOME ENTER SKINNER WILL YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION CERTAINLY. THE THE FULL REGULATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED YET AND CLEARLY THE- AND ONCE THEY- ARE. THEN THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT APPLY CAN SPECIFY HOWEVER WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE PRIORITY IS FOR EXACTLY THE POPULATIONS THAT YOU REFERENCED WHICH OUR- FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT. AND WHO WHO AND LEX I KNOW THAT- THE SENATOR. FROM THE SENATE THE READING AREA UNDERSTANDS THIS BUT SOME OF OUR OTHER MEMBERS MAY NOT THAT WHEN YOU ARE IF YOU'RE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM UP TO A CERTAIN AGE. YOU ARE PROVIDED FOR AND YET THEN WHEN YOU TRANSITION OUT. WELL WE HAVE SOME SUPPORT SERVICES BASICALLY YOU'RE KIND OF JUST LEFT OUT ON YOUR OWN. AND MOST OF US HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT SYSTEMS OUR FOSTR YOUTH DO NOT. AND SO IT MAKES SENSE. I THINK THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE PILOTED SUCH PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE THIS KIND OF MINIMAL SUPPORT AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A YEAR AND HE BASIC INCOME PILOT. WE'RE TALKING IN THE RANGE OF FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH MAYBE ONE THOUSAND AT THE MAX. THAT SUCH- PEOPLE WOULD RECEIVE WOULD CERTAINLY AS WE KNOW WHAT THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE TO FULLY SUPPORT YOURSELF BUT MIGHT JUST BE THAT THING. THAT ENSURES THAT YOU DON'T BECOME HOMELESS OR THAT. YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION.

SENATE BILL THREE HUNDRED BY SENATOR CORTEZ SEE AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMES AND DECLARING THE URGENCY VERUS EXPECT IMMEDIATELY CENTER CORTESE THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO- AND COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT SB THREE HUNDRED THE SENTENCING REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW MANDATES A SENTENCE OF DEATH. FOR LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE I'LL WALK. FOR ANYONE CONVICTED OF MURDER WITH SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN IF THE PERSON DID NOT KILL ANYONE NOR INTEND FOR ANYONE TO DIE. ADDITIONALLY FOR ALL CRIMES IN THE SENTENCING SCHEME. IF ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BROWN TO BE TRUE. THE JUDGE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND THE PERSON TO DEATH OR L. WALK. CURRENT LAW FORBIDS THE JUDGE FROM CONSIDERING. WHETHER THOSE PUNISHMENTS ARE FAIR BASED ON THE FACTS IN ANY GIVEN CASE. THE MANDATED MINIMUM. THE LAW IS TO DIE BEHIND PRISON WALLS WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF EARNING PAROLE. THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SENTENCING SCHEME WITH WAX EVEN MINIMAL JUDICIAL DISCRETION REFLECTS THE WORST TENDENCIES WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND OVERWHELMINGLY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR WHICH IS WHAT ORIGINALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BUT ATTENTION. AND SEEN THAT ISSUE OF FOCUS ME ON THE CORRECTION I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE TODAY MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE SERVING ALL WHAT CALIFORNIA ARE BLACK OR BROWN. THE VAST MAJORITY HAD NO PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD BEFORE BEING SENTENCED TO DIE IN PRISON. MOST FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IN FACT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE TIME WE INTRODUCE THIS BILL IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD. SB THREE HUNDRED WOULD SEEK TO FIX THIS OVERSIGHT IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY PREVENTING SOMEONE WHO IS NOT THE ACTUAL KILLER AND DOESN'T HAVE AN INTENT TO KILL. BEFORE BEING PUNISHED BY DEATH OR L. WHAT. IF THE JUDGE. DECIDES IN THE SENTENCING HEARING BUT THAT THERE ARE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL I WANT TO EMPHASIZE- IN I WILL PROBABLY AGAIN BEFORE THIS PRESENTATION IS OVER THE PENAL CODE ONE NINETY IS REMAINS UNCHANGED. PENAL CODE ONE NINETY IS THE STATUTE. THAT GOVERNS BUT THE ISSUE OF A OF THE MURDER OF A POLICE OF A POLICE OFFICER. IN THE STATE THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL. WHICH ALLOWS ANY KIND OF CHANGE IN SENTENCING- THE PENAL CODE ONE NINETY. THAT IS ALL WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT THE GOING BACK TO. THE ISUE AT HAND HERE WORK WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO CORRECT. WHAT I THINK WAS AN OVERSIGHT. OF WHEN THIS LAW BECAME LAW. IN TERMS OF NOT ALLOWING JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN CASES BUT HE WAS A MAY BE- WHERE AN ACCOMPLICE WAS COMMANDEERED. YOUR TRAFFIC TO WORK- IN SOME OTHER BUT LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT LITERALLY DID NOT. RISE TO THE CRIMINAL INTENT. OF THE PRIMARY SUSPECT. RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE REMOVED. THE RESENTENCING LANGUAGE FROM THIS BILL. WE REMOVED ANYTHING RETROACTIVE FROM THE BILL OF COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED ME A TO. ADD EXPRESS LANGUAGE THAT SAYS. NOT ONLY IS THERE NO RETROACTIVE RESENTENCING BUT THAT THIS BILL IF WE PASS THIS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. WILL ONLY APPLY TO NEW CASES FROM JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON THAT- OBVIOUSLY A CLARIFIES ANY ISSUE ABOUT CASES IN THE PIPELINE RIGHT NOW IN OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO COME IN AND MODIFY ANY SPECIFIC CASES THAT MAY BE PENDING WELL WE SPEAK. BUT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL. INSTALL THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. ADDITIONALLY WITH BAD LANGUAGE TO INDICATE THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT. TO DISSUADE OR INTERFERE WITH THE PROSECUTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ORCHESTRATED. BY BY WAY OF CONSPIRACY OR OTHER MEANS- OTHER THAN IMPUTED- IMPUTED FELONY MURDER SO. GREAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED IN AGAIN WITH WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES SOME WE HAVE A COMMITMENT AS THIS BILL MOVES ON TO THE OTHER HOUSE TO MAKE IT. RETRACT RETRACT OR TAKE AWAY. FROM THE HIGH LEVEL CRIMINAL INTENT THAT YOU SEE IN IN CONSPIRACIES AND OTHER ORCHESTRATIONS OF OVER THE PAST DECADE. CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE OF TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS. TO CORRECT IMPORTANT LANGUAGE INVOLVING PUNISHMENT AND IMPRISONMENT INCLUDING FOR PEOPLE SERVING LONG SENTENCES FOR SERIOUS CRIMES. I THINK THESE REFORMS HAVE BENEFITTED- AND EVEN ADDED TO THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BY RETURNING PEOPLE TO THEIR FAMILIES EVENTUALLY IN FREEING UP FUNDS A COMMUTER BESTED IN ADDRESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS INCLUDE EMAIL CALL JOB TRAINING EDUCATION. THIS BILL MAINTAINS THE THAT CURRENT LEGISLATIVE COURSE OF JUSTICE- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONE MORE THING BYE BYE TALK ABOUT PENAL CODE ONE NINETY- IN. A STATED HERE ON THE RECORD- THAT OF THE MRDER OF A POLICE OFFICER IS LITERALLY EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL. WE WILL PUT MORE EXPRESS LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THE STATE THAT CLEARLY AND IN A SINGLE SENTENCE OVER AND BEYOND WHAT OTHER LANGUAGE ALREADY SAYS FIGHTING BACK THE PENAL CODE ONE NINETY. BUT IN THE LASTLY- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS A SENTENCING BILL- OR WHETHER IT'S SOMEHOW INTENDS TO- VOID OR VITIATE A CONVICTION- THE LATTER IS NOT THE CASE IT'S ABOUT SENTENCING- DISCRETION FOR THE JUDGE WHERE THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M HAPPY TO- SPEAK ON THE RECORD ABOUT THAT IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS- IN THAT REGARD. BUT WITHOUT MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT AS A PROPER CO AUTHOR OF SB THREE HUNDRED I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE FOR HIS I WRK ON THIS ISSUE ON CALIFORNIA'S FELONY MURDER RULE ALTHOUGH WE'VE NARROWED IT IS STILL UNSEEMLY OVERBROAD I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR LAW STUDENT- IN OUR OUR CRIMINAL LAW CLASS LEARNING ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE. AND BEING TESTED SHOCKS ABOUT HOW BROAD IT WAS AND HOW PEOPLE COULD LITERALLY GO TO JAIL FOREVER EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT THEMSELVES KILL ANYONE OR MAY NOT EVEN HAVE KNOWN THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO DIE HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE AND HOW COULD THAT BE PART OF IT JUST PROCESSES SYSTEM. I IS A ROLE- I THANK THE SENATOR FOR BERKELEY FOR HER WORK. IN MAKING IT MORE RATIONAL BUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT SB THREE HUNDRED. FIVE DOLLARS. HI THIS IS SIMPLY GIVES DISCRETION SERVICE SOMEONE IS NOT HAVE TO SPEND. THE REST OF THEIR LIFE NO MATTER WHY. IN JAIL. IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE PENALTIES. IT SIMPLY GIVES JUDGES MORE DISCRETION. TO DO WHAT WE WANT JUDGES TO DO TO LOOK AT THE FACTS OF THE CASE. I MAKE AN EVALUATION. AND NOT JUST GO FOR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE WITH THE JUDGE HAVING NO OTHER OPTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT A GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THREE HUNDRED I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS VERY HARD WORK ON THIS BILL- THREE HUNDRED WOULD ADDRESS AN INJUSTICE IN OUR CRIMINAL SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS VICTIMS OF ABUSE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO BEING NEAR THEIR ABUSERS VIOLENT ACTIVITY AND ARE THUS OFTEN PROSECUTED AS ACCOMPLICES. FOR EXAMPLE. PACIFIC WAY A WOMAN A VICTIM OF SEX TRAFFICKING SINCE SHE WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF ONGOING TRAFFICKING AS AN ADULT. WAS WAITING IN THE CAR WHEN UNBEKNOWNST TO HER HER ABUSER THE TRAFFIC- TRAFFICKER SILVA MA'AM. SHE WAS PROSECUTED AND SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE THE LAW. THOUGH POLICE AND PROSECUTORS UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE DID NOT KILL ANYONE BUT THE JUDGE HAD NO CHOICE. AND EVEN WORSE. HER USER WAS ACQUITTED HER CASE EXEMPLIFIES A PATTERN SEEN WITH WOMEN SENTENCED UNDER THE FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE LINE CALIFORNIA. SB THREE HUNDRED WILL ENSURE THAT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IS NOT A MANDATORY MINIMUM FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE WE DID NOT HARM OR INTENT TO HARM ANYONE. IT WILL ALSO RESTORED JUDICIAL DISCRETION WHICH WILL ALLOW JUDGES TO CONSIDER CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STATEMENTS OF VICTIMS AND OTHER EVIDENCE WHEN DETERMINING SENTENCING. SB THREE HUNDRED WILL ENABLE JUDGES TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE BUT THEY ARE NOT MANDATED TO SENTENCE PEOPLE TO PRISON TERMS THEY DO NOT THINK OR JUST OR FAIR. THIS MEASURES AN IMPORTANT REFORM FOR WOMEN WHO WERE CONVICTED FOR DEADLY ACTIONS OF THEIR ABUSERS WHILE SURVIVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MEMBERS I REPRESENT TO PRISONS IN MY HOME TOWN OF CHINO IN A WOMEN'S PRISON IN CHINO MEN'S PRISON. I'VE LIVED THERE MY WHOLE LIFE AND WE ALWAYS JUST SAW THE PRISONS AND IT WAS JUST PART OF THE LANDSCAPE. ONCE I BECAME ELECTED I STARTED TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY HAPPENING THERE. AND I WOULD INVITE ANY OF YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH ME ON A TOUR AND ST DOWN AND TALK TO THE GOLDEN GIRLS. MANY OF THESE GOLDEN GIRLS HAVE FALL FALL UNDER L. WALKER IN THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES SOME EVEN IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES. AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST A LIFETIME IN JAIL. UNDER THIS. THIS LAW. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO MEET SOME OF THEM AND UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED THEM SO MUCH I'M HAPPY TO SET THAT UP. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TODAY IS VOTE HI ON SB THREE HUNDRED. SENATOR NIELSEN. NOT A PRESENT LADIES ON THE SENATE I WILL OPPOSE THE BILL AND REQUEST THAT MANY OF YOU CONSIDER A NOBLE. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE AND JUSTICE INCLUDES THE VICTIMS. NOW A LATER ON BETTER THE FELONY MURDER RULE HAS PERFECT. AND INDEED IT DOESN'T MEAN THE ONE THAT SIMPLY PULLED THE TRIGGER. THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A LOT OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES OCCUR. A WELL PLANNED. MAYBE ON SOME RARE OCCASION THERE'S AN ADVERT AN EMERGENCY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAPPENS TO BE ALONG FOR THE RIDE IF YOU WILL. BUT I REVIEWED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THESE CASES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AT THE ERRORS THAT MAY BE HAVE OCCURRED ARE RARE I ASSURE YOU. BUT THE PENALTY IS A JUST WANT LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING THERE REALLY IS NO SUCH THING AS THAT SENTENCE WHY. THIS BUDGET DASCHLE DECISION OR BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION AS AN HERE IS PROPOSED. THAT CIRCUMSTANCE CAN CHANGE THAT INDIVIDUAL. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A DEATH PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA. BY THE VOTERS REAFFIRMED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO BY THE VOTERS. BUT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO JUST MADE A UNILATERAL DETERMINATION THERE WILL BE NO EXECUTIONS. IN THE STATE. IN OTHER WORDS THAT HIS OPINION. OVERRULED THE OVERWHELMING VOTERS OF THE STATE. LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE I ARGUE SHOULD REMAIN AS IT IS BECAUSE OF THE HEINOUS NESS OF THE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS INVOLVED IN. AND THE IMPACT TO THE VICTIMS AND HE WILL TALK TO SOMEBODY. TALK TO THE VICTIM IS THE MOTHER. THE FATHER. THE BROTHER THE SISTER. OF THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS MURDERED. IT ALSO STUDY THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOURSELF OF WHAT THE VICTIM WAS SUBJECTED TO BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. IN CALIFORNIA TOOK THE FIRST STEP TO. ADJUST CALIFORNIA'S VERY UNFAIR FELONY MURDER LAW WITH SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND MY CO AUTHOR AND I AUTHORED THE BILL MY A CO AUTHOR WAS OUR SAN DIEGO SENATOR JOEL ANDERSON. AND HE CO AUTHORED THE BILL WITH ME BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD FUNDAMENTALLY THAT OUR FELONY MURDER LAW. WAS UNFAIR. AND LET'S BREAK IT DOWN. YOU CAN BE THE MURDER. CAN BE CHARGED WITH FIRST DEGREE MURDER. AND THEN BE SENTENCED FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER. AND YOU CAN RECEIVE A LOWER SENTENCE ANY PERSON WHO. I DID NOT COMMIT THE MURDER DID NOT PLAN THE MURDER DID NOT HIRE SOMEONE TO DO THE MURDER DID NOT ORCHESTRATE THE MURDER. BUT UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE YOU COULD RECEIVE A HIGHER SENTENCE NUMBER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WE ARE CORRECTING WITH THIS. IN EFFECT DURING TEES BUT YOU GET THAT SENTENCE THE JUDGE HAS NO DISCRETION WHATSOEVER. MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE THE JUDGE HAS SOME DISCRETION. WHICH IS WHY THE JUDGE FACTORS THINGS THAT RELATED TO THE MURDER AND WHY THERE ARE SOME FOLKS MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE YOU DO NOT HAVETHE SAME SENTENCE. AS THOSE WHO GET CHARGED WITH THIS. SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE RUSSIAN ROULETTE. BUT YOU. YOU CAN I MEAN IT'S I'M GOING TO MAKE A TERRIBLE ANALOGY BUT IN A WEIRD WAY YOU'VE BEEN BETTER OFF TO BE THE ACTUAL MURDER WE DO NOT WANT TO INCENTIVIZE MURDER. AND THIS ALLOWS BGA THE DEFENSE. THE VICTIM'S FAMILY. HOWEVER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON'S ROLE IN THE CRIME IS WHAT'S CONSIDERED INDENT THE SENTENCING IT DOES NOT LET PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK IT DOES NOT. AND THERE IS AN IRONY FOR AN ILL LOGIC IN A PENAL CODE THAT ALLOWS THE FIRST DEGREE MURDER TO BE SENTENCED AT A LOWER SENTENCE THEN THE PERSON UNDER THIS FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO CORRECT AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL RIGHT. SENATOR FROM BERKELEY WHY DID YOU NOT PUT THAT IN FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE PASSED THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT. THE CORRECTION OF THIS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE SITUATION BECAUSE OF A PROPOSITION REQUIRES THE TWO THIRDS VOTE WHICH IS A HARD BLOW TO GET. AND SO. I INTRODUCED MY BILL WITH ONLY ADDRESSING THE PORTION THAT WASN'T IMPACTED BY THAT BECAUSE I WANTED TO REALLY HAVE I WANTED THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A FULL DEBATE AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS BILL ANY MURDER RULE I'M NOT A LAWYER I DIDN'T GO TO LAW SCHOOL SO I HAD NO IDEA WHEN. AS I VISITED PRISONS AND LEARNED ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU COULD HAVE SUCH A MINIMAL ROLE IN THE CRIME AND YET RECEIVE A HIGHER SENTENCE THAN THE ACTUAL MURDER. AND SO UNDERSTANDING AND I'M SURE MANY OF ALL OF YOU DID NOT. THOSE OF YOU ATTENDED LAW SCHOOL MAY UNDERSTAND IT WELL BUT THOSE OF YOU DIDN'T I'M SURE DOES IT WOULDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO YOU. AND IN FACT WHEN I SPOKE TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ABOUT MY BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. THEY WERE ALSO BLOWN AWAY THAT YOU THE CALIFORNIA HAD SUCH A LAW THAT COULD SHOW DISPROPORTIONATELY THREE. B. THE PERSON IN IN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME. SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS BILL ONLY COVERS THOSE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHO DID NOT KILL. WHO DID NOT INTEND TO KILL WHO DID NOT PLAN THE MURDER WHO DID NOT HIRE SOMEONE TO MURDER. WE DID NOT COORDINATE THAT MURDER. AND CHAU ORCHESTRATED. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN NERO APPLICATION. AND WITHOUT AYE ELSEVIER AYE VOTE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS COMMON SENSE MEASURE IF THIS IS REALLY ABOUT JUSTICE IT WOULD BE JUST US BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE FELT FACING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE JUSTICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS KURT BARBARIC WAY OF SENTENCING IT'S ONLY BLACK AND BROWN AND POOR PEOPLE WHO EVER GET THE SENTENCE YOU'LL NEVER FIND A RICH PERSON ON LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE AND WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW STATES AND COUNTRIES THE WHITE LOCK PEOPLE UP. WELL FOR LIFE SPECIALLY BABIES WE HAVE A LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. FOR FOLKS UNDER EIGHTEEN HERE IN THE STATE WHEN I CAME TO A LEGISLATURE AND WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO CORRECT THAT. BOB SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE YOU HAVE. ARE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHO TREAT THEIR PRISONERS FAR MORE HUMANE THAN WE DO EVEN COUNTRIES WHO WILL CUT YOUR HAND OFF FOR STEALING WILL NOT LOCK YOU UP. FOR LIFE. AND WE'RE FAR BEYOND. ACTING LIKE THE SYSTEM GET OUT. OF JAIL FREE CARD IT DOESN'T DO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT FOLSOM PRISON. THE NUMBER YEARS AGO. AT EVERYONE WHO APPROACH ME WHO IS FACING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE WERE BLOCKING BROWN INDIVIDUALS AND THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO SIMPLY WERE AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. AND THEY'VE HAD THEIR LIVES THROWN AWAY. AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME I TALK TO PLEASE WE DIDN'T PULL THE GUY AND I ME PULL THE TRIGGER DID NOT HAVE THE KNIFE JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE CAR. WHEN THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED OR WAS SITTING IN THE CAR SOMEONE WENT INTO A STORE SHOT SOMEONE JUMPED IN THE CAR- BUT NO TO THE ON THEIR DRIVING UP AND OUR STUFF AND THEY GET CHARGED WITH AIDING IN A BAG BETTY SILVA. I THINK THE SENATOR PER OF SAN JOSE FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY WHO HAS WORKED HARD ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. AND IF IT'S REALLY. ABOUT JUSTICE THEN LET'S HAVE A VOTE. ON THIS THANK YOU. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I FIRST WANT TO SAY TO THE AUTHOR THAT I HAVE I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR- HIS WORK IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT AREA AT THE- AT THE CRIMES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ARE ARE THE MOST HORRIFIC. AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THE MOST PROFOUND FOR EVERYONE THE VICTIM'S FAMILY THE PERSON ACCUSED AND IT IS A VERY- I FIND IT TO BE THE- ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF LEGISLATING IT IS IN THIS SPACE AND I SO APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA. AND I APPRECIATE THE NARROWING THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THIS BILL. I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR- A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I MAY NOT A PRESIDENT. SENATOR CASEY WOULD YOU TAKE A QUESTION YES MEMBERS OF. OUR GOOD FOR SHAPE THAT. IT THE BILL ADDRESS ADDRESSES. ACTUALLY ELIMINATES A STANDARD- THAT- IS A SIGNIFICANT STANDARD- IN THE PROSECUTION AND POTENTIALLY THE SENTENCING OF AN INDIVIDUAL THAT STANDARD IS THAT. IT'LL AND THIS IS WHAT GETS LIMITED IN UNDER YOUR BILL. THAT THE PERSON ACTED WITH RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE FOR HUMAN LIFE. AS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT. IN CERTAIN VIOLENT FELONIES THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT YOUR BILL ELIMINATES INSERT AND SOME CASES AND I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THE THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF THAT LANGUAGE WILL THAT AFFECT IN ANY WAY. THE PROSECUTION. OF A PERSON. UNDER THAT STANDARD. NOT JUST THE SENTENCING ISSUE WHICH WILL GET TO NEXT BUT THE PROSECUTION IS DOES YOUR BILL IN ANY WAY LIMIT THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER A PERSON. UNDER THAT STANDARD. THE FIRST WELL THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION IN- THE OPPORTUNE TO CLARIFY. BUT NO IT DOES NOT THE RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE. STANDARD IS ESSENTIALLY- WERE ACCOMPLICES UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BEING CONVICTED OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER. AS MY COLLEAGUE THE FROM BERKELEY A POINTED OUT THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE MORE THAN INTENDED TO CHANGE- THE- THE PROSECUTION- FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER OF THOSE ACCOMPLICES WHAT IT INTENDS TO DO AS Y. EMPHASIZE IT WAS A SENTENCING BILL IN MY PRESENTATION- IS GIVE THE JUDGE IF THERE IS. IF THERE IS- A CONVICTION. UNDER THAT STANDARD THAT YOU JUST RAISED. THAT THE JUDGE CAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN CASE IT IS A SITUATION LIKE WE HEARD IN SOME OF THE OTHER TESTIMONY. WHERE SOMEONE WAS COMMANDEERED- WHERE THEY WERE CONVICTED EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE CONDUCT COMMANDEERED ARE TRAFFICKED OR THERE WERE SOME OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT IT SIMPLY IS FOCUSED ON THE SENTENCING PHASE OF THE TRIAL THE ACTUAL SENTENCING HEARING AND REALLY ALLOWS DEFENSE TRYING TO COME FORWARD AND SAY- YOUR HONOR- WE'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THE FACT. OF THE DESPITE THE CONVICTION OF MY CLIENT BUT DID NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF CRIMINAL INTENT AS THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS PERHAPS- IN THIS MURDER. WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO TAKE THAT CONFUSION OF THE BILL AND MAKE WHAT I JUST SAID EXPRESSED IN THE BILL- YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WILL DO THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT REALLY GOES TO MY SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE IN THE BILL ITSELF. HI THIS IS ON PAGE THREE LINE SIXTEEN IT SAYS THIS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO LIMIT THE APPLICATION. OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACCOMPLISH IS. WHO ACTED WITH INTENT TO KILL. SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NOW SO COULD YOU LARIFY THAT LANGUAGE THAT IN REGARD TO WHAT YOU JUST PREVIOUSLY SAID IN A IN IN BASED ON WHAT MY COMMITMENT JUST WAS- AT THE RISK OF TRYING TO AMEND THE BILL- WITH EXACT LANGUAGE TODAY I DON'T. I'M PROBABLY NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THAT. WITH THAT LANGUAGE. THAT LIMITATION- IS REALLY AN EXPANSION IT MEANS THE WORDING IS TO BE CHANGED TO ALLOW- THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE CRIMINAL INTENT ROSE TO THE LEVEL. OF RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE. YEAH IT'S JUST NOT THE DANGER ANSWER THAT'S ON SENTENCING NOW YES THAT LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO ONLY APPLY TO SENTENCING NOT THE PROSECUTION. THAT'S CORRECT VERY GOOD AND ONE FINAL. QUESTION IF I MAY. THAT IF THE JUDGE AND THIS IS A JUDGE- IN REAL TIME GOING FORWARD IF YOU CLARIFIED THAT THE START DATE. OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWO. BUT IF THE JUDGE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES GOING FORWARD. WERE TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION THAT THAT. STANDARD THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ELIMINATING AS APPLICABLE. WHAT IS THE MINIMUM THAT I JUDGE COULD- SENTENCE THAT INDIVIDUAL TO. WEAR THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TO ARISE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS AGAIN THERE WOULD STILL BE A MURDER CONVICTION AT THAT POINT. AS YOU AS- AS YOU GO INTO THE SENTENCING PHASE OF THE TRIAL IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE. A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE BUT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. OKAY AND FINALLY I APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR CLARIFICATION. IF THE JUDGE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES- UNDER YOUR BILL WERE TO MAKE THAT FINDING. AND- ESTABLISH A SENTENCE AT A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE- THAT PERSON WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO ALL THE PAROLE. REQUIREMENTS IN OUR STATE MEANING THAT THEY COULD APPLY AT SOME POINT. AND WHEN THEY- SERVE THE MINIMUM FOR PAROLE AND THAT A PAROLE BOARD WOULD BE ABLE TO EXAMINE- ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR TIME IN PRISON THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR ETCETERA TO. EVEN MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE BUT THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED AT SOME POINT TO GO ON PAROLE IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE ORIGINAL FORM OF THIS BILL. AS A BASIS FOR PEARL FERNANDEZ THE MOTHER OF GABRIEL FERNANDEZ THE BASIS FOR HER TO CONTEMPLATE ASKING FOR RESENTENCING AS YOU RECALL GABRIEL FERNANDEZ WAS AN EIGHT YEAR OLD LITTLE BOY WHO WAS TORTURED. BEATEN NEGLECTED AND ALTERNATELY MURDERED BY PEARL FERNANDEZ'S BOYFRIEND. GABRIEL'S MOTHER PEARL FERNANDEZ MOST CERTAINLY PARTICIPATED IN ALL OF THESE ACTIONS THAT TOOK A GABRIEL'S LIFE THERE SHE DIDN'T COMMIT THE FINAL BLOW THAT TOOK HIS LIFE. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN OUT. THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD MAKE IT RETROACTIVE GOING FORWARD WHAT IT WILL STILL ALLOW S FOR SOMEONE. WHO COMMITS CRIMES LIKE PEARL FERNANDEZ DID CAUSING THE DEATH OF HER SON. TO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN THE CASE WHICH I BELIEVE- SHOULD NOT EXIST THIS. AT I'M BEGGING YOU TO DEEPLY CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO AND THINK OF THE GABRIEL FERNANDEZ'S OF THE WORLD WHO MAY- BECOME. VICTIMLESS IN THE FUTURE OF. THEIR PARENT OR THEIR PARENTS BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. SINGMAN CENTER CORTESE ME YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- LET ME- ONCE AGAIN- THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY FOR- HOME FOUNDATIONAL WORK AND MORE THAN FOUNDATIONAL WORK BUT THE SIGNIFICANT WORK BY THAT HELP SO MUCH TO GET US TO THIS POINT- FOR HER EFFORTS TODAY- FOR ALL THOSE WHO SPOKE.

IS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE THREE. SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AND AFTER RELATING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY SENATOR PORTANTINO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU- MADAM BOOK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE FOUR FOUR WHICH IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE AND IT IS IMPORTANT MEASURE WHICH EXPANDS THE CALIFORNIA FILM A TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE. DIVERSITY I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE PRO TEM AND BUDGET STAFF AND PRO TEM STAFF FOR GETTING US TO THIS POINT- THIS TRULY WAS- A COLLECTIVE EFFORT- RECOGNIZING HOW IMPORTANT. THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS TO THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE HERITAGE OF OUR GREAT STATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A INDUSTRY THAT GOES ACK OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THAT IS PART OF THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA AND- CENTRAL TO OUR SUCCESS IS AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE. SIGNIFICANTLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE CONCURRING ON EXPAND THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT BY NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT. HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL- THAT DEMAND FOR- BRINGING MORE PRIDE PRODUCTIONS BACK CALIFORNIA HAS EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT THE PRE PREVIOUSLY BUDGETED AND WE NEED THIS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO COVER. THAT DEMAND. AND BY MEETING THAT DEMAND WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC VITALITY AND HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR STATE AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC SIGNIFICANTLY. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A NEW FILM INFRASTRUCTURE TAX CREDIT WHICH ENCOURAGES INVESTMENTS IN STUDIO AND SOUNDSTAGES IN CALIFORNIA. THE LIFE CYCLE OF A SOUND STAGE IS A HUNDRED YEARS LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN THE LIFE CYCLE OF A SOUND STAGE IS A HUNDRED YEARS. SO WHEN WE BUILD NEW SOUNDSTAGES WE'RE BUILDING CAPACITY FOR THE NEXT CENTURY THAT MEANS GENERATIONS OF WORK FORCE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WILL WORK OUT OF THESE NEW SOUND STAGES. THAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS BILL AND AGAIN THE BUILDING TRADES WERE A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTER. AND INITIATOR OF THIS- PROPOSAL TO CREATE THOSE JOBS BUILDING THOSE SOUND STAGES AND THEN. HAVING A PLACE FOR THAT ENTERTAINMENT WORK FORCE. TO DO THEIR TRADES FOR THE NEXT CENTURY- ADDITIONALLY. THE BILL REQUIRES. REPORTING RELATED TO WORKFORCE DIVERSITY IN THE FILM INDUSTRY THAT HAS LONG BEEN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS UP HERE ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE THIS CORE- CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY REFLECT WHAT CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE DATA COLLECTION RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL TAX CREDIT AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIVERSITY GOALS TIED TO THE NEW PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT FOR THE STUDIO PRODUCTION- AND WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS AND I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WENDY CARILLO IS WE'RE ASKING THE STUDIOS AND THE PRODUCTIONS TO CREATE THEIR OWN GOALS AND BENCHMARKS ON DIVERSITY AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION WILL VERIFY THAT THOSE GOALS. ARE MET- OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN MANY TAX CREDITS THAT WERE USED TO- DURING LATE NIGHT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS BACK WHEN A TWO THIRDS WAS REQUIRED. TO PASS A BUDGET AND MANY OF THOSE TAX CREDITS HAD NO ACCOUNTABILITY I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE INTENDED PURPOSE WAS ACTUALLY CREATED WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT TAX CREDITS IS. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE THE PRODUCTIONS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BUILD THE STAGES YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS BEFORE YOU EARN THOSE CREDIT SO. FOR THOSE OF US WHO CARE DEEPLY IN THIS BODY DOES CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEASUREMENTS AND INDEPENDENT DATA THAT'S EMBEDDED INTO THIS. PROGRAM AS WELL AS FOR THE MONETARY BENEFITS BUT ALSO ON THE DIVERSITY BENEFITS- THIS IS. EXTREMELY CRITICAL TO OUR STATE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND ACTUALLY AN ACCIDENT THE FILM PRODUCTIONS AT A CALIFORNIA TO THE SOUTH AND TO THE NORTH- ARE INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. THAT THEY BROUGHT THOSE PRODUCTION- BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SB FIVE ONE FOUR FOUR BUILDS ON THE RESOUNDING SUCCESS OF THESE TAX CREDITS- WHICH ARE BROUGHT DOZENS OF PRODUCTIONS BACK. TO WHERE THEY BELONG THEY BELONG HERE WITH US- IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FORTY FOR IS A BROAD COALITION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND LABOR WHICH INCLUDES AS I SAID THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- IOTTIE COUNCIL MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION THE DIRECTORS GUILD OF AMERICA. SAG AFTRA ALLY YOU KNOW LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR AND THE TEAMSTERS LOCAL THREE NINETY NINE SO THERE'S A BROAD COALITION OF. MIDDLE CLASS WORKING FAMILY JOB PRODUCING PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT LET'S BRING A CORE HISTORICAL INDUSTRY BACK TO CALIFORNIA. LET'S MAKE IT THRIVE CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND AGAIN I WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO EVERYBODY. WHO'S MADE THIS HAPPEN TODAY OUR PROGRAM WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN CREATING THE TAX CREDIT WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKER. AND HER OFFICE AND ARE BUDGET STAFF AND I WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO OUR BUDGET- CHAIR. MISKIN AND EVERYONE WHO'S WORKED TO BRING THIS- COLLECTIVELY TO PUT US ON THE FLOOR TODAY. AS SOMEBODY REPRESENTS BURBANK WHICH IS ONE OF THE INDUSTRY- HUBS IN OUR STATE I'M PROUD TO AUTHOR- SB ONE FOUR FOUR AND ASK EVERYONE TO VOTE ON THE CONCURRENCE TODAY. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER WELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE FORTY FOUR THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THOUGH THE WORK- THAT APPROACH HIM DEAD WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY HOW SHE GOT GOVERNOR BROWN TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS I HAVE NO IDEA HE DID RELUCTANTLY BUT IT HAPPENED. AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THESE- THESE NEW- ITEMS IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW- TEN YEARS AGO THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTIONS GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD TODAY IT'S OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED- BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR CONTENT BECAUSE IT'S STREAMING SO THIS IS KEEPING UP. WITH TECHNOLOGY SECONDLY TO ME THIS IS A PRO FAMILY BILL ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WITH THE RUNAWAY FILM PRODUCTION YOU KNOW MOM SINGING KIDS WERE STAYING OUT AT HOME AND DAD WAS IN GEORGIA- IN NORTH CAROLINA WHAT HAVE YOU- MY DISTRICT HAPPENS TO BE IN THE TEAM SEE- RUNAWAY FILM PRODUCTION CREATED A LOT OF DIVORCES AND BROKEN FAMILIES.

TECHNOLOGY SEEING EACH ONE OF YOU BUT I AM ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF YOUR GOOD WORK ON THIS. AND IF WE EVER DOUBT WHETHER INTERNET ACCESS IS AN ESSENTIAL NEED THE PANDEMIC MORE THAN DEMONSTRATED THE NECESSARY NECESSITY EVERY CALIFORNIANS HAVE RELIABLE ACCESS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION IN TODAY'S WORLD MORE MORE WE ALREADY KNEW THAT WE WERE DEPENDENT ON THE INTERNET FOR APPLYING FOR JOBS APPLYING TO COLLEGE AND SUCH BUT OF COURSE DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE RELIED ON ENTIRELY TO CONTINUE OUR EDUCATION WHETHER WE WERE A KID OR ADULT YOU NAME IT WE ALSO NEEDED TO RELY ON IT FOR MUCH OF OUR HEALTH CARE SO THAT WE CAN AVOID HAVING TO GO TO A HOSPITAL IF THE POPE IT WAS NOT OUR ISSUE AND WE DID NOT WANT TO GET COVERAGE SO WE WERE USING THE INTERNET FOR OUR OTHER HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND WHAT DID AND WE ALSO WERE USING IT TO ENSURE THAT OUR FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS AT THE FOOD AND THE OTHER GOOD THING NEEDED. BUT WHAT MADE IT OBVIOUS IN THE PANDEMIC WHAT MANY OF US ALREADY KNEW IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS GREAT AND NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET FOR ANY ACCESS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS ENABLE US TO. PUTS THIS ON THE AND THAT WE MADE IN THE BUDGET BILL WE ADOPTED AND WITH THE BENEFIT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS. IT CREATES THE ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT THAT STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK DISCOUNT WHICH IS A GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT.

OUR SPEC CLASS FOR NAVAL. SENATOR WITH A- THANK YOU FOR THE PRESIDENT TO AND SANDERS- FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO RATE RISE AND JUST CELEBRATE THIS WONDERFUL BUDGET THAT WE PUT TOGETHER THIS IS TRULY HISTORIC AND THIS BILL IS INCLUDED IN WHAT IS REALLY HISTORIC YEAR BUDGET WISE AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND IN IN OUR STATE THEY'RE REALLY UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS REALLY A NEW AND EXCITING. A PROGRAM THAT WE'RE GONNA ROLL OUT IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP CONNECT ALL OUR COMMUNITIES WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD FOR MANY YEARS TO CONNECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN SLOW THIS INVESTMENT IS GONNA SPEEDED UP ENORMOUSLY SO I JUST WANTED RAISE UP MY MIKE AND- IN SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE SENATE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING STRONGER ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SO- THEY'LL BE- MORE PARTICIPATION AND LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE. WHERE THEY'RE MADE AND- THEY'LL BE MORE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM AND I WANT TO THANK- ARE ARE SENATORS A PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM- CENTER GONZALEZ CENTER MCGUIRE CENTER COUPLE YET ON OF COURSE FOR OUR ARE POTENTIALLY TO SHIP ON THIS ISSUE COMMITTING THE GROUP WORKING VERY HARD TO SORT THIS OUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO. THIS IS. A WONDERFUL PROGRAM AND I RECOMMEND I VOTE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ONLY CHOSE TO SPEAK ON TO BUILD TODAY AND THIS IS ONE I THINK NEEDS TO BE SPOKE ON. ME ASK YOU WHAT GOVERNMENT DOES GOOD. WE HAVE THE E. D. WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH WE HAVE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE DMV I T. PROJECTS. WATER BOND WE CAN'T GET OUT FOR WATER. LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL. IT'S GOING TO BY PASS THE PRIVATE COMPANIES AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRIVATE COMPANIES WE HAVE DONUT HOLES AND WE HAVE THE LAST MILE. THAT NEEDS TO BE SERVED. SO WHAT ARE THE LEGISLATURE DO THE LEGISLATURE. WITH MY HEALTH AND MANY OTHER OF YOU IN THIS ROOM PASSED. EXTENDING FUNDS FOR CASTLE. WHICH WOULD HELP THOSE PRIVATE OWNED COMPANIES. GET TO THE DONUT HOLES AND THE LAST MILES IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT DID THEY DO. THIS IS WHAT THEY DID ZERO. THEY DIDN'T ACCESS THE FUNDS. THEY'RE ALSO THE ONES THAT WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS GOING TO FAIL. BECAUSE THEIR THEIR PRIVATE COMPANIES AND ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS PROFITS. FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. THIS BILL. SO IT IN AB THE TWENTY SIX SIXTY FIVE. THE MONEY THAT THE CAST THE FUNDS GO TO GO TO THAT YOU SEE AND THEN NONPROFITS. USE THAT MONEY AND THEY'RE RETIRED LEGISLATORS. WHO HAVE SET UP THESE NONPROFITS TO DO THE BILL TO EXTEND THE MONEY AND WHAT WE GET FOR THAT WE GOT. ZERO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS WHERE GOVERNMENT WORKS. WE HAVE UTILITIES I HAPPEN TO BE. A SMUG CUSTOMER PG&amp;E CUSTOMER AND- RULE ELECTRIC COOP CUSTOMER AND OUT OF THOSE THREE. THE ONE THAT SERVES ME THE BEST IS MY COOPER YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE- I'M A MEMBER WE OWN IT. WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT WE'RE FORGETTING THE SERVICE TO. EACH OTHER IN A POOL. OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO TAKE THE- ASSEMBLY THE LEADERSHIP- IT IS A PRO TEM. MY WIFE FOR ACTUALLY PUTTING IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WILL ALLOW RULE COOPS AND UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS THAT IS SECTION FIVE SUBSECTION FIVE THREE ONE SIX SEVEN. IN PLUMAS COUNTY. VERY RULED COMMUNITY WE HAVE HIGH SPEED NTERNET IMAGINE THAT WHY. BECAUSE A RULE ELECTRIC CAME IN AND PUT IT IN. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION THAT IN THIS BILL THAT I'M EXPERTS CITED ABOUT. IS THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND TWO SENATORS APPOINTED TO OVERSEE THIS. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU- I'M GONNA BE WATCHING THIS LIKE A HAWK LIKE I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE WILD FIRE MONEY. BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE UTILITIES THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T JUST CAN SIMPLY TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BILL WHEN I ASKED YOU. TO GIVE ME A SOLUTION. NOT ONE OF THEM COULD TELL YOU THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY MR DALLEY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO GET THE LAST MILE. AND THE DONUT HOLES AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNSERVED IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL. WE'RE GONNA CAN CAN YOU TO SEE. MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO FINE TUNE IT. AND I WILL BE WATCHING THAT. AND MANY OF YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK ABOUT THE DEBT IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE FOR OUR CHILDREN. I'VE BEEN HERE NINE YEARS. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET INTERNET FOR MY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE STATE WE CAN EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN WE CAN HELP OUR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WE CAN HELP OUR FIRE COMMUNITIES WE CAN HELP OUR HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS OR LIBRARIES AND WE HAVE NOT GOT ANYTHING EVEN THOUGH WE PUT THE MONEY UP. SO MORE SO I WANT TO SHARE THIS IS INVESTMENT. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK TO DO IT RIGHT. AND I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF HEARING FROM UTILITIES AND THOSE WHO. ALWAYS CRITICIZE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES. BUT DOESN'T HAVE A SOLUTION. AND WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT A SOLUTION. AND WE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE THEY DON'T TAKE IT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE VOTING TO GET INTERNET. AND BROADBAND TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT AND IF ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE SEEN DURING THIS TIME. DURING THE PANDEMIC HOW DESPERATELY WE NEEDED IN NOT JUST THE ROLE PART OF CALIFORNIA'S BUT THE URBAN PARTS AS WELL. SOMEONE AGAIN THANK THE PRO TEM THE SPEAKER. THE SENATOR FROM LONG BEACH THE SENATOR FROM SALINAS WHO HAVE WHO'VE WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND WORKED REAL HARD AND I'M GONNA BE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION I DON'T BELIEVE IN BEING A LEGISLATURE THAT JUST. LEGISLATOR THAT JUST **** ALL THE TIME. I WANT TO DIG IN. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. SO I'M HERE AT YOUR SERVICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET INTERNET. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO- RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THINK SENATORS GONZALEZ AND CARREIRO AND REQUIRING THE PRO TEM FOR REALLY GUIDING THIS THROUGH TO THIS FINISH LINE- AS THE SENATOR FROM BEAVER STATED YOU KNOW RURAL AND URBAN RESIDENTS ALIKE- DESERVE THIS AND I THINK THEY WILL BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM THIS BUDGET BILL. IN THIS DIGITAL ERA WE- BROAD IS CRITICAL RIGHT. NOW THAT'S A JOKE BUT THE TRANSLATION OF THAT IS WE NEED THIS BILL BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH DEALING WITH INTERNET SERVICE DEALING WITH BROADBAND SERVICE THAT CUTS OUT THAT IS INCONSISTENT- THAT IS FRIED THE HEADS OF THE HAIRS OF PROBABLY ALMOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING IN THIS STATE. CONNECTIVITY ACTUALLY BECOMES. LIFE SAVING. I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I SHARED THIS WITH OUR BUDGET HERE BECAUSE I SEE THIS IS OUR MODERN DAY WPA IT'S A MODERN DAY WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION BILL IT CREATES JOBS IT UPGRADES AND IT BUILDS OF NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONNECTIVITY FOR EVERYONE AND IT CREATES TANGIBLE OUTCOMES WITH ACCOUNTABILITY BUMPERS. BECAUSE PEOPLE ALL OF US ARE FRUSTRATED FROM LIVING IN A MODERN TIME WHERE YOU CANNOT HAVE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO JOBS EDUCATION TO HEALTHCARE TO EMERGENCY CALLS. JUST CHECKING INTO YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS. WHEN CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO SEE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING BROADBAND IN TACKLING THIS ISSUE AND I THINK THIS CATAPULTS US INTO THE SERIOUS CLUB LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS. THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS FLUID AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HONEST ABOUT THAT AS TECHNOLOGY AS POPULATIONS AS CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO HAVE A BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ALSO ADAPTIVE. WHICH IS WHY I ALSO AGREE THAT HAVING THE CZAR AND HAVING THE COUNCIL IS OH SO APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT WHILE WE ARE MAKING A STRONG AND DECLARATIVE STATEMENT ABOUT BRINGING BROADBAND TO ALL. THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION AND INVESTMENT AND NOT THE END SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND ONCE AGAIN THANK ALL THAT MOVED TO GET THIS TO THE FINISH LINE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE BETTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA AYE ATKINS AYE BATES.

FOR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE FOLKS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE AS YOU KNOW LAST WEEK I STOOD UP AND RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR BILL ONE FOUR ONE AND IN MANY WAYS THOSE CONCERNS STILL EXIST TODAY- WHAT I SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED FOR REAL ADDRESSING SOCIAL EQUITY. AND IT SHOULD BE A CONCERN FOR ALL OF US AT FOUR OUT OF FIVE CANNABIS BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A PROVISIONAL LICENSE. BUT 100% OF OUR EQUITY. OPERATORS ARE WORKING UNDER A PROVISIONAL LICENSE LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN A 100% OF EQUITY OPERATORS ARE WORKING UNDER PROVISIONAL LICENSE AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO SKIRT THE LAW. THEY WANT TO WORK I THE LEGAL SPACE. AND ALL EQUITY BETTER BUSINESSES. DID YOU KNOW BUT THE BAR IS SO INCREDIBLY HIGH FOR THEM. FILE ON FOUR FOUR ANNUAL LICENSE THIS WEEKEND I OPPORTUNITY DISSIPATE INTO REDING CUTTING OF A CANNABIS STORE IN THE HEART. OF LA LAW CRENSHAW BOULEVARD- THAT BY SEX. BALLING HILLS ANGLER. THE BLACK BEVERLY HILLS AND WHAT WAS SO SIGNIFICANT IS THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN AND FIRST FEMALE OPERATOR TO GET A LICENSE ON CRENSHAW BOULEVARD. THE FIRST AND SHE TOLD OF THE STRUGGLES OF WHAT A JERK NOT ONLY HER PARENTS BROUGHT HER CHILDREN THREE GENERATIONS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS BUSINESS SURVIVE. AND MAY NEED TO PAY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR OVER A YEAR. JUST TO STAY AFLOAT WHILE WAITING FOR THEIR LICENSE TO BE PROCESS- THIS SHOULD TROUBLE ALL OF US ABOUT THESE EQUITY LICENSES BUT NOT ABLE TO FULLY ACHIEVE THEIR FULL LICENSURE WHEN MANY WHITE AND WEALTHY BUSINESSES CAN DO IT. WHAT THE- NOW FOR THEIR FINGERS MOST PEOPLE CANNOT NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS WITHOUT HIGH PAID CONSULTANTS AND LAWYERS AND EVEN THEN IT TAKES YEARS AND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCESS CREATE. EQUITY BUSINESSES- FOR EQUITY BUSINESSES SHOULD BE ALARMING TO ALL OF US- THIS TRAILER BILL- PROVIDES EQUITY APPLICANTS WITH THAT EXTRA YEAR TO ATTAIN A NEW PROVISIONAL LICENSE BUT SADLY THAT'S ALL THAT IT DOES THERE'S NO SUPPORT FOR EXISTING EQUITY LICENSEES. AND BACK SIMPLY DOES NOT FLY WITH ME. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT THE DISCUSSION CONVERSATION EEDS TO CONTINUE AS IT RELATES TO EQUITY. AT THE CORE OF THIS DISCUSSION IS IN ABOUT A PROVISIONAL LICENSE. AND WHO GET THEM AND HOW LONG THEY HAVE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE I SHOULD SAY FOR SEQUEL COMPLIANCE THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED AND PROSECUTED FOR DECADES DURING THE WAR ON DRUGS A WAR THAT WAS STARTED BY. RICHARD NIXON. TO CRIMINALIZE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE THAT'S WHY I WAS PUT ON THE SCHEDULE ONE. BUT AGAIN THEY FIND THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES IN TRYING TO BECOME LEGAL BUSINESSES THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR DAY. TO DAY. AND THE BUSINESS IN OF OUR MIDDLE ISSUES AND CANNABIS HAPPEN BE ADDRESSED AND HAVE TO REALIZE THAT- WE KEEP WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO MAKE PROMISES OF THE GOVERNMENT. TO THOSE AND- HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS IS NOT ACHIEVED AS I SEE IT. PROMISES AREN'T REALITY WE NEED REALITY WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THIS APPLICATION. CANNABIS I RESPECT LESS RIVAL. IS THERE ANY FURTHER.
