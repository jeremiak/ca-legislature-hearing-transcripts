I'D LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA FOR CO HOSTING THIS HEARING I WITH US HE OF COURSE IS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL. AND IT JUST DOES RATHER IT GOING IN YOU KNOW IN IN THE BIG PICTURE CERTAINLY WE ALL HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE NATION IS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEM SERVING MORE THAN. TWO MILLION STUDENTS I'M IMPORTANT ADMISSIONS SERVING AS A GATEWAY FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS SEEKING A BETTER LIFE THROUGH THE POWER OF EDUCATION. PROVIDING WORKFORCE TRAINING. COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS FROM ENGLISH TO CITIZENSHIP CLASSES THE BACHELOR'S DEGREES THERE ARE CERTAINLY A VITAL PART. OF OUR. OF OUR CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO TO THRIVE WEEK WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE. LANDSCAPER THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS CHANGING WE NEED MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES TO FILL THE JOBS OF TOMORROW WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE. GOOD PAYING JOBS AND BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME AND SO FORTH NEED MORE EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL SO THOSE TWO THINGS. ARE CRITICAL AS WE LOOK AT THESE PROPOSALS THAT WE DO HAVE A. TO DO HAVE MANY QUESTIONS ON BOTH OF THEM ESPECIALLY THE ONLINE PROPOSAL. I WITHHOLD MY QUESTIONING UNTIL WE START THE HEARING. PASSWORD THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR CULTURE TODAY MR MEDINA FEEL LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. STEWART DID THANK. THE CHAIR FOR HOSTING AND FOR A HAVING THIS TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT DISCUSSION MUCH NEEDED DISCUSSION. AND. BOTH ITEMS SO LOOK FORWARD TO A. HEARING FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU SO WITH THAT WILL SPRING UP. THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OUR CHANCELLOR. FROM THE FINANCE REPRESENTATIVE. AND MR CABRAL FROM THE LA UP. YEAH. I BELIEVE IT CANCERS GONNA. STARTED OFF THIS MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING. TO MEMBERS OF OF BOTH COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT TWO VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT. AS YOU MENTIONED THAT YOUR MCCARTY. WE ARE THE LARGEST SYSTEM NOT ONLY OF. MANY COLLEGES BUT WHERE THE LARGE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE NATION. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON OUR NATION. NEARLY ONE IN FOUR OF EVERY COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS IN THE NATION IS A CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE TO DO SO THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. NOT ONLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE NATION. SO BEFORE I GET US STARTED I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. YESTERDAY TODAY THE CALIFORNIA THREE COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS. OUR MEETING. AND MANY OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY SO I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ASK THEM TO STAND UP. VERY QUICKLY. FOR BEING HERE. I BROUGHT HIM AS WITNESSES. I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE OR BOARD PRESIDENT'S TO SEE IF THE LLANO AND. IF. IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO COME UP IN CASE THERE'S QUESTIONS REGARDING THE GOVERNANCE AND SHE IS WITH US TODAY. UP OR PRESIDENT DILLON. THANK. UP SO. BUT LET ME BEGIN. BY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. THE OTHER DAY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. LEVERAGING. THE SCALE AND THE SIZE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. TO BUILD A STRONGER MORE PART PROSPEROUS CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WE WANT TO SEE. A MORE PROSPEROUS CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE. THAT THAT REALITY IS CHALLENGED. CHALLENGED BY THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTION TO BEGIN WITH A CHAIR MCCARTY. THAT. THE STATE OF THE CURRENT ECONOMY THE STATE OF THE WORKFORCE NOW REQUIRES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WORKFORCE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CREDENTIAL BEYOND. HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THERE WAS ONCE A DAY WHERE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WAS. THE. THE DEFAULT TO GET INTO THE WORKFORCE. THOSE DAYS ARE GONE AND THAT'S A REALITY NOT JUST FOR THE STUDENTS IN THE PIPELINE. BUT ALSO THE WORKERS. WHO ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED? AND WHO ARE STRUGGLING. THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. ALL OF US ALL HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES WE DRIVE TO THAT MISSION EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT. ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN THAT'S CAPTURED IN THE SYSTEMS VISION FOR EXCESS WHICH BOARD OF GOVERNORS ADOPTED. LAST YEAR. A KEY PART OF THIS EFFORT. IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK WHICH YOU ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT LAST YEAR AND SUPPORTED. TO CONTINUE TO STREAMLINE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS IN OUR SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. OR TO THE JOB THAT THEY WANT TO BE SKILLED AND TRAINED FOR. SO I'M EXCITED TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ON ON THE AGENDA. CREATING A FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM. A PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM. IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT. WHICH IS DEMAND DRIVEN. WHICH IS STUDENT CENTERED. COMPETENCY BASED. AND FOCUSED ON SCALABLE JOB SKILL ACQUISITION. I TOOK MY TIME HIGHLIGHTING THOSE WORDS. BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. CERTAINLY WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STUDENTS CENTER. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE HERE IS BUILDING A PLATFORM. PLATFORM TO REACH WORKERS. AN ADULT LEARNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN JOB SKILLS. THROUGH A COMPETENCY BASED. ENVIRONMENT. ONLINE. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE. BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO FOR WAGE GAINS AND FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WELL WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS CONTINUING TO BUILD OUT. OUR ONLINE PRESENCE FOR TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO AND SUPPORT THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE SUPPORT THAT WORK AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THAT WORK. BUT WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE. IS THE NOTION OF REACHING WORKERS AND GIVING THEM THE JOB SKILLS THEY NEED. DEVELOP AN ON RAMP. TO R. HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS? ONE OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN CULTURES. I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF YOU. ABOUT THE ONLY COLLEGE IN ABOUT THE CHALLENGE IN GENERAL OVER THE YEARS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS DIALOGUE IS HOW MUCH WE ALL AGREE. ABOUT THE NEED TO PUSH OURSELVES TO DO BETTER ALL OF US THOSE OF US ON THE DIET THOSE OF US. IN THESE CHAIRS. WE ALL NEED TO DO MORE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO STRESS. IS AND I KNOW. MANY OF YOU AGREE ON. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A STATE. WITH. THE FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY. WE KNOW WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE. CORINTHIAN SHUT DOWN. WHEN I TT SHUT DOWN. AND SEVERAL OF YOU ON THIS DIETS WERE CHAMPIONS FOR THOSE STUDENTS. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO CHAMPION. PUBLIC SOLUTION FOR THOSE STUDENTS. BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING IN ENVIRONMENT TODAY. WHERE? THE ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC HAS ONCE AGAIN OPEN THE DOOR WIDE OPEN. IT'S PREDATORY PRACTICES. SO WE'LL WE COME FORWARD WITH THE PUBLIC SOLUTION FOR THAT. I SAY WE SHOULD. AND I SAY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHO IS IN THIS ROOM ARE WILLING. TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THAT CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO. AS I TRANSITION INTO TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM IF I CAN JUST ASK EVERYONE. EVERYONE. TO SET. RHETORIC ASIDE. TO SET POLITICS ASIDE. AND THINK ABOUT WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT SERVING HERE. THERE ARE OVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS IN THE WORKFORCE WHO ONLY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. OR SOME COLLEGE. IF YOU EXTEND AT AGE SIXTY TWO WHICH BY THE WAY MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE NEEDING TO WORK BEYOND THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO. THAT'S. NEARLY EIGHT MILLION. THESE ARE THE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS HAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO THE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY THE MOST VULNERABLE TO AUTOMATION THE MOST VULNERABLE. TO ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. AND YES OUR COLLEGES ALL OVER HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES I'M PROUD TO SAY HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES. BUT THE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY ARE HAPPENING SO FAST. THAT WE NEED ONE MORE OPTION AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING IS ONE MORE OPTION IN THE ARSENAL OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO BE ABLE TO REACH MORE OF THESE ADULT LEARNERS. WILL WE REACH ALL OF A NO. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BULLET HERE NO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE MORE OPTION TO REACH. SOME OF THESE WORKERS AND ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC. MOBILITY. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND FOR THAT MATTER MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FIND THEMSELVES STRUGGLING TO TREAD WATER IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS WHAT'S CLEARLY EVIDENCED IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. WHERE YOU SAW THE FRUSTRATION? OF WORKING CLASS AMERICANS. CHAU ITSELF. BECAUSE THESE WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ARE FINDING IT HARD. FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS ECONOMY. SO WE NEED A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING WHAT. WORKING AGE ADULTS NEED. CREATING A PERSONALIZED COMPETENCY BASED PLATFORM TO REACH THEM. ENSURING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE OPPORTUNITY ALONG THE WAY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE PIPELINE FOR CURRENT STUDENTS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. AND ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO BETTER SERVE THE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE. BUT I BELIEVE WE ALSO NEED ONE MORE TOOL. TWO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SKILLS FOR THE WORKERS ARE IN THE WORKFORCE TODAY. I'VE BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK MANY TIMES ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN. AND WHILE. THAT. SEMINAL DOCUMENT. REALLY DR THE LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE ABOUT. OUR THREE SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING. THE. THE VERY HARD WORKING. PRIVATE NON PROFITS. BUT. THE COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER. IT DID NOT CONTEMPLATE. UP SPILLING OR RESCALING AN ENTIRE WORKFORCE. SO WE NEED GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION GOING FORWARD. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE MASTER PLAN. WE HAVE A SYSTEM. THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES THERE ARE BETH POSITION. TO DEAL WITH THAT. CHALLENGE. I BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE. ON OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE STRANDED WORKERS WE CALM STRANDED WORKERS AND IN YOUR PACKET YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT. THAT LISTS. WHERE THE STRANDED WORKERS ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE? THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST BE GIVEN AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PUT THEMSELVES IN OUR ECONOMY ON THE PATH TOWARD GREATER PROSPERITY. IN THAT FIRST DOCUMENT THAT YOU SEE WITH THE MAP OF CALIFORNIA. IT IDENTIFIES THE TWO AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED A CREDENTIAL NEEDED FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THIS POPULATION NO SURPRISE. IT'S NEARLY HALF LATINO. THIRTY ONE PERCENT WHITE NINE PERCENT ASIAN AND SEVEN PERCENT AFRICAN AMERICAN THESE ARE CALIFORNIA. AND AS I MENTIONED ANOTHER SIX POINT TWO MILLION ADULTS BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND SIXTY FIVE ARE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS. ON THE BACK OF THE DOCUMENT YOU CAN ALSO SEE BY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. THE NUMBER OF STRANDED WORKERS AS WE CALL THEM. THAT ARE IN THE VARIOUS ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS REPRESENTED. ON THE STATUS. SO THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE. I I AND I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALL DO CARE. SUPPORT THESE INDIVIDUALS SO THIS IS I'M NOT BRINGING THIS UP AT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT WE ALL SUPPORT THESE WORKERS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE BEST SUPPORT THESE WORKERS SO I APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO FOCUS ON THEM. THE PROSPECTS OF THESE STRANDED WORKERS. ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNCERTAIN. AND THIS IS JUST NOT A SAINT. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES BY THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE WITHIN TWO YEARS. SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF ALL JOB THE UNITED STATES WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST. SOME COLLEGE POST SECONDARY CREDENTIAL. IN THE GROUND IS SHIFTING QUICKLY. AS I MENTIONED. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUTOMATION ARE HAVING HUGE IMPACTS ON THE ECONOMY. WE'RE ON RAMPS EXIST THEY OFTENLEAD TO PROBLEMATIC GROWTH TOO MANY OF THESE WORKERS OFTEN TURN TO THE FOR PROFITS AND I MENTIONED EARLIER AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS THERE. WE'VE SEEN THE STUDIES THAT SHOW. EVEN. IF A STUDENT. TENDED KNOW FOR PROFIT COLLEGE THEY WOULD STILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION THE ECONOMY THAN IF THEY HAD ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. BUT I'M SPEAKING TO THE CHOIR HERE ON THIS UP. SO. BUILDING SOMETHING THAT WORKED FOR CALIFORNIA'S STRANDED WORKERS. MEANS ALLOWING THE COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM. TO MOVE FORWARD AND DESIGN A PLATFORM. THAT CAN REACH THEM. NOW. THIS. ONLINE COLLEGE THIS PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM. WILL FOCUS ON SHORT TERM CREDENTIALS. MICROCREDIT JULES BUT CREDENTIALS. THAT ALLOW A STUDENT TO GAIN JOB SKILLS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND IS INTENT THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ABLE TO STACK THEM. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THEM CREATE AN ON RAMP. FOR FURTHER CREDENTIALS AT ONE OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES OR THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. SECOND THIS PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE A FULL RANGE OF SUPPORTS. THAT WE NO STUDENTS NEED INCLUDING TUTORING COACHING MENTORING. AND HOW WILL THIS BE DONE THIS WILL BE DONE. BY US PARTNERING. WITH LABOR. WITH EMPLOYERS. INDUSTRY SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES. AND WITH REGIONAL LEADERS. AS WELL AS OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES MANY OF THEM HAVE A GREAT FOOTHOLD IN THE REGIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO REACH MORE WORKERS. IT WILL BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP. AND I. I AM CONVINCED THAT. PARTNERS AND I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING OUT THESE PATHWAYS IN ENSURING THAT WE REACHED THE WORKERS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT. ON THE SECOND DOCUMENT YOU HAVE WE HAVE THAT. WE DESCRIBE THE CRITERIA. BY WHICH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IS EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL PATHWAYS HAS BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS THAT YOU'RE TALKING. SO FIRST WE WANTED TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND WORK WITH OUR LABOR AND EMPLOYER PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT WE DESIGN PRINCIPLES DESIGN PRINCIPLES. THAT WILL GUIDE US IN DEVELOPING THE PATHWAYS. SO THE DOCUMENT YOU HAVE OUTLINES. HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK WE WILL FOCUS ON IN DEMAND? FIELDS. IT WILL BE STUDENT CENTERED COMPETENCY BASED FOCUSED ON JOB AREAS THAT REQUIRE SCALABLE RESPONSE. BUILT ON EXISTING AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPLEMENTED THROUGH STRONG PARTNERSHIPS THOSE ARE OUR PRINCIPLES. SO. HOW WOULD WE MEASURE SUCCESS? WE WOULD MEASURE SUCCESS. BY WHETHER OR NOT. AN INDIVIDUAL STRANDED WORKER GAINS MORE ECONOMIC MOBILITY DO THEY HAVE WAGE GAINS AT THE END OF THE DAY. THIS IS ABOUT. ECONOMIC MOBILITY DO THEY HAVE DO THEY GET A PROMOTION DO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY INTO A DIFFERENT FIELD DO THEY HAVE WAGE GAINS. AND CAN THEY CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION ON TO A HIGHER LEVEL CREDENTIAL. THAT IS THAT MEANS BY WHICH WE EXPECT HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. SO. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON. TO OUR VERTICAL PATHWAYS. AND ONE IS A HORIZONTAL PATHWAYS. SO. THAT INFORMATION IS. IT'S IN YOUR PACKET BUT. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'RE LOOKING AT. AT AT. THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. FOR THE HORIZONTAL PATHWAY WERE FOCUSED ON. ADVANCING INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE FIRST LINE SUPERVISORS. AND HOW DO WE LAND ON THOSE AS I SAID WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD. WITH OUR PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATHWAYS. I WILL BEGIN TO. TO CLOSE. IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME FOR QUESTIONS BUT. LET ME. TAKE SOME TIME TO CLARIFY. SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ARE SOME MYTHS. FIRST OF ALL LET ME BE CLEAR. WE HAVE NO INTENTION NO DESIRE AND THERE IS NO THOUGHT. TO THE NOTION THAT WE WANT TO PRIVATIZE CORPORATE TIES OR COMMERCIALIZE THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CODES. I AM A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE. THREE OF MY FOUR KIDS ARE PRODUCTS OF CALIFORNIA ME CAUSES. THIS IS A CROWN JEWELS. IN OUR NATION WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING. TO PRIVATIZE THIS IS WE ARE GOING TO REMAIN A PUBLIC SYSTEM. THAT. REACHES MORE STUDENTS THROUGH INNOVATION. SECOND. WE DON'T TEND TO OR HAVE ANY DESIRE TO CANNIBALIZE ENROLLMENT FROM OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. SO MATTER FACT WE WANT TO BUILD. THE ENROLLMENT FOR A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. MANY YOU UNDERSTAND. THERE ARE COLLEGES ARE NERVOUS. THEY'RE NERVOUS BECAUSE WE HAVE ENROLLMENT DECLINE IN THE STATE. OUR COLLEGES ARE STRUGGLING. TO GET THE ENROLLMENT THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR BASE FUNDING. PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE COMING UP NEXT FOCUSES ON THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS REACHING STUDENTS. THAT NEED JOB SKILL CREDENTIALS NOT THE TYPICAL UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION HAPPENS AT OUR FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. SO WE DON'T SEE THAT THIS WOULD CANNIBALIZE IS MATTER FACT WE THINK IT WOULD CREATE A NEW CO HEART. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO THEN CAN ACCESS MORE EDUCATION HIGHER LEVEL CREDENTIALS AT A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. SO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A NET BENEFIT. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. THE HUNDRED FIFTEENTH COLLEGE BEAN. THE FAITHFUL TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE. A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. COLLEGE. THE FACULTY IN THE CLASSIFIED STAFF WOULD HAVE. EVERY RIGHT IN OPPORTUNITY. CHOOSE A BARGAINING UNIT. TO NEGOTIATE. SALARY. WORKING CONDITIONS JUSTICE ALL OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE AND THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT. SO IF THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT THIS GROUP HAS TO CLARIFY THAT. WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE ALSO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK. IF THESE ADULTS CANNOT LEARN. IN AN ONLINE PLATFORM. AND AFTER I PAUSE IN CONSIDER. WHERE THAT COMES FROM I I HAVE TO? TRIED TO RESPOND. AS. AS. CALMLY AS POSSIBLE. THESE INDIVIDUALS LEARN EVERYDAY. ON THE JOB. THESE OUR VETERANS WHO LEARNED A GREAT DEAL OF SKILLS. WHILE IN THE MILITARY THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE MASTERED THEIR CRAFT IN THEIR PARTICULAR JOB THEY CAN'T WORK. BUT THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION THEY HAVE LEARNED THROUGH. EXPERIENCE IN TRIAL THAN DEMONSTRATING A COMPETENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LEARN. AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO THEM TO LET THEM PROVE TO US THAT THEY CAN'T MARK. SO. DOES ONLINE EDUCATION WORK FOR ADULTS. I THINK IF YOU CONSIDER THE DATA. ON ON ONLINE EDUCATION FOR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. OUR FACULTY HAVE CLOSE TO SUCCESS GAP BUT LISTEN FIVE PERCENT TODAY BETWEEN BRITAIN ORDER EDUCATION AN ONLINE EDUCATION SO I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN OUR FACULTY AND BY THE WAY WILL BE OUR FACULTY TO TEACH. THESE COURSES. UP AND FURTHER MORE. IF YOU LOOK AT COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS FOR ADULT LEARNERS ACROSS THE NATION THEY HAVE SERVED ADULT LEARNERS VERY WELL. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE A THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE ADULT LEARNERS SO. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NEXT? WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK PARTNERS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO TRY AN IRON OUT THE PATHWAYS IN THE SKILLS THAT ARE PARTNERS FEEL ARE THE. A CRITICAL NEED IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO BUILD COALITIONS. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT. INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS. I HAD THE CHANCE EARLIER TODAY TO MEET. ROCKS AND VALENCIA WAS HERE TODAY. AND I HOPE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO HEAR FROM HER LATER ON. SHE WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS. SHE WAS A STUDENT ONE F OUR COLLEGES WHO DESPITE HER LOVE OF LEARNING. STRUGGLE TO COMPLETE A TRADITIONAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK. SHE HAD TO SUPPORT HER FAMILY AND SHE COULDN'T DROP EVERYTHING. TO ATTEND PART TIME OR FULL TIME AT ONE OF OUR TRADITIONAL COLLEGES. SHE'S HERE TODAY AND I HOPE YOU GIVE HER A CHANCE TO SHARE HER STORY. SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO REITERATE THE APPROACH. WE WILL PROVIDE FOR A PUBLIC QUALITY AFFORDABLE EDUCATION TO THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BODY. CAN AND SHOULD HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE OUTCOMES. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE FOR THE FOR PROFITS. A AND. THAT WE WILL LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. THE OUTCOMES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE FOR A PATH TOWARD ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUCCESS. I THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME. TAKE THE TIME. TO COMMUNICATE AND ARTICULATE TO YOU WHY WE FEEL THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU WITHOUT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT FOR US TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA GO TO AND TO GIVE THEIR OVERUSED. THINK YOU I GOOD MORNING WRITE SO HE SAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WANT TO BUILD OFF SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT CHANCE ROLE WE MADE. REGARDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND ALSO PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICITY ON SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF AT THE PROPOSAL. SO WE BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD BECAUSE WE SEE THIS AS A WAY TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT BEING SERVED BY THE EXISTING COMMITTEE COLLEGES WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY. AS CHANCELLOR OAKLEY NOTED WE KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT CURRENTLY SERVING THESE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. OUT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT PREPARING FOR THE NEXT RECESSION SO WE SEE THIS AS AN INVESTMENT ON THE PEOPLE'S SIDE. ANTIPOPE TO GUARD AGAINST NEXT RECESSION. ARE OFFICE ANALYZED AT CENSUS BUREAU DATA OF UNEMPLOYMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. AT IT AS PART A LAST RECESSION AND HOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS RECOVERED AND NOT SURPRISINGLY. INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ANY POST SECONDARY CREDENTIAL AND HAD THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND RECOVERED AT A MUCH SLOWER PACE AFTER THE NEXT RECESSION. CHANCELLOR OAKLEY ALSO MENTIONED THE ROLE OF PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND WE SEE THIS AS AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE WE KNOW THAT PRIVATE AND FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AN OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS CAN CAUSE SEVENTY NINE TIMES MORE PER UNIT THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS ON MY COLLEGE WHAT OFFERED AFFORDABLE OPTION CONSISTENT WITH THE FORTY SIX DOLLAR PER UNIT. FEE REQUIRED OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THE COLLEGE WOULD OFFER FEE WAIVERS CONSISTENT WITH AT THE OTHER COLLEGES. WE ALSO SEE AT THIS PROPOSAL IN LINE WITH AN OVER. AFRI MORGAN THE BUDGET OF ACCESS WITH SUCCESS SO IT'S CHANCEL YOU TRANSFER OAKLEY MENTION AND I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAS BEEN. HAS HOW EFFECTIVE IS ON MINE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE MULTIPLE STUDIES INDICATE THAT OLDER STUDENTS HAD TO PERFORM WELL IN A SELF DIRECTED. SUCH AS AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT. AND RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES AND A PROPERLY STRUCTURED ONLINE ENVIRONMENTS IS A CRITICAL FOR ASSURING SUCCESS. WHICH LEADS ME TO IT ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT UP COMPONENTS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT. SO THE TRAILER BILL REQUIRES THAT THE ONLY COLLEGE WHO ESTABLISH THIS UNIT. THE UNIT WILL ASSESS DATA METRICS AS SOON IN PROGRESS IT WILL INFORM INSTRUCTIONAL AND SUPPORT STRATEGIES AND ASSURE THAT THE THE TECHNOLOGY IS WORKING OUT FOR THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS OF WORKING LEARNERS. THE UNIT WILL CONSTANTLY REVIEW COLLEGE PROGRAMS STUDENT LEARNING DATA STUDENT SUPPORT OPTIONS SUIT AND STUDENTS EMPLOYMENT AFTER A COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR INTENDED INDUSTRY. TO THAT END THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME AND TWENTY MILLION I'M GOING FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE. THE ON GOING FIND THE WOULD SUPPORT. OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING FUNDING FOR THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT OUT LICENSING AND MAINTENANCE OF TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR THE COLLEGES STAFF. THE ONE TIME FILE A FUNDS WHAT SUPPORT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACQUIRING RELEVANCE TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURING ACCREDITATION ESTABLISHING KEY PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS AND DEVELOPING BUSINESS PROCESS HE'S. THE COLLEGE AS TRANSFER OF THE MEASURE WILL BE HELD TO THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AS ALL OTHER COMMITTEE COLLEGES. AND I WILL REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THOSE SPECIFIED ITEM AT METRICS INCLUDE IN THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDING OUTCOMES FOR THE STUDENTS. THE ONLY COLLEGE WOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT BODY THAT IS GOVERNED BY AN INDEPENDENT DISTRICT GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WHILE THE COLLEGE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE JUST LIKE ANY COLLEGE IT WILL BE RUN BY A COLLEGE PRESIDENT AND HIS OR HER STAFF. THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES WILL INITIALLY SERVE AS THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE COLLEGE. NO LATER THAN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE A DISTRICTS SPECIFIC BOARD OF TRUSTEES WOULD BE ESTABLISHED. I'M SO THANK YOU AND ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ALEJO'S. A GOOD A GOOD MORNING I TEARS THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES THAT GROUP BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M WE DID A PATH A HANDOUT THAT I WOULD BECOME SUMMARIZES. BATHA BACKGROUND ON THE PROPOSAL IN SUMMER DESIROUS OF BEEN A RECOMMENDATION. IF ARE CHEAP WILL SKIP OVER DRACULA PAGE FIVE OF THAT ASSESSMENT WHICH IS WHERE WE. START WITH OUR ASSESSMENT I THINK. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL AT THIS POINT. I I THINK THERE ARE ARE A KEY CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT. THAT THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IS NOT TIED TO SPECIFIC ROUTE ISSUES. THAT THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL'S WITH PARTICULARLY ADDRESSED EXOTIC IN GENERAL WE DON'T AND CONCERNS WITH THE. IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT IF AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE. INTERSTATE THAT IS. OF MOST LIKELY TO DO WORSE IN RECESSION THAN HAVE A HARDER TIME RECOVERING. THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T HAVE ANY POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRYING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. ARE KIND OF A CHANGE THE WAY WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM SO THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR EDUCATIONAL COMES THE DIPPING WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. I THINK OUR OUR OUR KEEP OUR KEY CONCERN IS THAT IT IN THE PROPOSAL THERE'S NO CLARIFICATION OF WHAT WHAT WE THINK ARE THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR THIS GROUP. NOT NO INFORMATION THAT GIVE THE FENCE THAT THAT THERE IS A SPECIFIC UP PROBLEM WITH ACCESS THAT IS THAT IS. THAT IT'S BEEN THOUGHT BY THE ON MY COMMUTE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT OUR PARTY CONCERN AND AND AND MORE SPECIFICALLY. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE STUDENT IS NOT BEING SERVED BY THE BY THE EXISTING COMMUNICATIVE BETTER I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CLEAR INDICATION. THAT WE THINK THAT THE COLLEGES ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG TO PREVENTING THESE STUDENTS FROM BEING SERVED THIRTY POTENTIAL STUDENTS FROM BEING SERVANTS I THINK. WITHOUT HAVING A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT WE THINK BUT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS THAT THE COLLEGES FIXING. IF IT'S HARD FOR US TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THIS INVESTMENT WHEN THE THIRTY RESULT IN THE IN THE OUTCOME IMPROVEMENT OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT. PREEMPT IN PARTICULAR SO WE LET ARE A FEW OTHER A PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT ARE IN OUR OFFICE ONE OF THING I WOULD I WOULD. PLAN I WAS ALSO. THAT IS CHALLENGING ISSUE OF TRYING TO FIND PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE BALL BEING A STATEWIDE PROGRAM SO I THINK. WE KNOW THAT IN MOST OF THE A PROPOSED PATHWAYS THAT THAT DID MISTER SMITH CONSIDERING. THERE IS SOME KIND OF A NEED FOR A HANDS ON COMPONENT WHETHER THAT BE AT A COLLEGE. WHETHER THAT BE RUN BY INDUSTRY WHETHER THAT THE BEAST I'M. IN SOME ASPECT EVEN JUST FINDING SPACE FOR THAT TO BE AVAILABLE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE. I'M I THINK IT'S UNCLEAR FROTH. HOW DOES? PARTNERSHIP WILL BE DEVELOPED ALL ACROSS THE STATE I'M IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAMS TO REALLY CREATE THE GIVE FOLKS THE SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT IF THAT IF THAT CAN HAPPEN STATEWIDE THE NEITHER THOSE SKILLS ARE NOT COULD BE AVAILABLE OR TWO YOU HAVE SINCE THE REGIONAL PROGRAMS THROUGH THIS ONLINE COLLEGE IN AND. TO US I THINK THE ISSUE OF CREATING AN ONLINE BECAUSE TO CREATE REGIONAL PROGRAM THINGS A LOT CONSIDERING THAT. THAT THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES ARE SORT OF REGIONAL AND. ON. THE THE OTHER THING I THINK WE WERE JUST HIGHLIGHT AGAIN OF THAT. CREATING THE A NEW COLLEGE COMPARED TO WORKING WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP AN ORGANIZATION FROM THE GROUND UP THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER TO GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING IN THE ME THAT IT LIKELY WILL BE MORE COSTLY. AND THEN BEFORE. ANY ACCREDITATION YOU ARE GONNA HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE ENTERING THE PROGRAM. IN ERROR ARE. IN A PROGRAM THAT'S NOT ACCREDITED WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T APPLY FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID AND THEY CAN'T TRANSFER THE CREDITS TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. I'M SO ANDTHEN SWITCHING OVER DEFEAT SIX JUST OUR ISSUES ARM FREE TO CONSIDER WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE. ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL OR THE ELEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE COLLEGE THAT. THAT ARE PROMISING THAT SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST. FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF HAVING MORE PERSONALIZED COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD. THERE BE CONCERNS ABOUT AND BEING ABLE TO. I USE THAT AS A WAY TO RECOGNIZE THE PRIOR LEARNING AND SKILLS THE PEOPLE WHO COME IN AND OUT TO GET TRAINING MAKES A LOT OF FANS. BUT AGAIN FOR US WITH BEING CLEAR ON WHY THE ONLINE COLLEGES THIS. THAT. THERE ARE YOU COULD ALSO EXPLORE STATEWIDE IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUR EXISTING FHA THUMB. FOR EXAMPLE FINDING WAYS TO. ENCOURAGES COLLEGES TO DO COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IS BY CHANGING THE FISCAL MODEL WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL DISCOVER THE NEXT ITEM. I'M SO DID SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE TOGETHER TO TO. TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION AND BECAUSE THE FIFTH AVE A SOLUTION THAT WE THINK ADDRESS OF THE. THAT THE ROOT ISSUES WE ENCOURAGE WHAT FUTURE IT YOU MIGHT STILL BE INTERESTED AND IN PURSUING THIS KIND OF APPROACH WE ENCOURAGE THOSE SEIZURE TO. GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS ARE. WHAT ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE PROBLEMS AND AND REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE COULD BE DESIGNED TO RESPOND TO THOSE ISSUES AND THEN HOW COULD BE FUNDED HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE OBJECTIVES? THANK YOU. START NOW WITH OUR DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. IT'S A MEDINA. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. I I MIGHT START BY SAYING THAT I WAS SKEPTICAL. WHEN I IRST A HERD OF THE PLAN. I BELIEVE. I WAS INFORMED OF THE PLAN OF THE DAY BEFORE THE GOVERNOR PER A REVEALED HIS BUDGET. AND THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF CAME TO GIVE ME A HEADS UP. THAT. THE GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSED IN THIS. I WAS SKEPTICAL THAT. BUT AFTER SITTING HERE AND LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATION I HAVE TO HONESTLY SAY THAT I HAVE MUCH MORE SKEPTICAL NOW. THAN I WAS WHEN I FIRST HEARD. I I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING AN EDUCATOR. AN EDUCATOR FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND I TURNED TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO SHARED MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING A CLASSROOM TEACHER. AND I DO NOT. YOU KNOW. I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF AN EXPERT IN MUCH. AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I GET TO VOTE ON HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO DO WITH MANY OTHER THINGS THAT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT. AND I DO THE BEST I CAN. TO TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. KNOW WHETHER THEY BE WATER. INSURANCE. HEALTH. AND I DO MY BEST TO GET MYSELF. WHERE I FEEL THAT I'M KNOWLEDGEABLE? IN THAT. BUT IN EDUCATION HAVING SPENT THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM. THIRTEEN YEARS ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SEVERAL YEARS ANA KATE TWELVE. BOARD. I DO FEEL I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EDUCATION. I SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THE SENSE OF URGENCY. TO REACH US STUDENTS PERHAPS OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKPLACE. WHO HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM? THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THE BEST THAT THEY COULD. OR DID THE BEST THAT THEY CAN. OR SHORT. IN A SYSTEM. THAT IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO HELP OTHERS. BUT I SEE IN FRONT OF THOSE. AND IDEA. WHO? EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW DOESN'T SHOW ME. THAT IT IS BEEN THOROUGHLY THOUGHT OUT. AT ALL. AND I TAKE TO HEART. WOULD THE L. A. O.. OF BRINGS HERE THAT THIS IS NOT LOOKING AT THE ROOT CAUSES. THE DO YOU KNOW WHY WHY IS IT THAT THESE TWO AND A HALF MILLION. STUDENTS OR NOT STUDENTS INDIVIDUALS NOW ADULTS IN THE WORKPLACE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BETTER. MAKE USE OF. THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM NOW IN PLACE. THE IDEA OF BEGINNING FROM SCRATCH. FROM BEGINNING FROM. NOT. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY. IS IS BOTHERSOME TO ME. I SEE. NO EVIDENCE STILL THAT THIS METHOD WOULD BE THE BEST METHOD. TO TO BRING THESE. TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS UP I DON'T SEE ANY COLLABORATION YOU'RE WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS OF. THE REGIONAL. WORKPLACE. IMPROVEMENT. STRUCTURES THAT ARE THERE. SO I I. YOU NO LOOK FORWARD TO MORE QUESTIONS BY MY OWN COLLEAGUES BUT I DO NOT SEE EVIDENCE. THAT THIS REALLY. WOULD DO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. I DON'T. AND SO I I WILL I WILL LISTEN NO LAST MORE QUESTIONS BUT AYE AYE. HARD PRESSED TO IT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME YOU KNOW THIS IS TAKING SOMETHING THAT IS AN IDEA. AND JUST PUT IT FORWARD. AND. ASKING THE LEGISLATURE ON FAITH. TO TO. APPROVED. I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE QUESTIONS AND. HEARING MORE. IT'S A LITTLE. WELCOME IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS SIR. I THINK. PROBABLY THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE MAKING AND YOU'VE MADE AT GOOD PRESENTATION HERE. OF THIS MORNING BUT THERE'S. VERY LITTLE MEAT ON THE BONES RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE HAVING THE OVERVIEW BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS A SIN IT'S AN OVERVIEW SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO. RECEIVING MORE DETAIL AND MORE INFORMATION. PRIOR TO OUR. HAVING TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO MOVE THIS FORWARD OR NOT. COUPLE OF THAT BACK QUESTIONS I HAVE A AT NIGHT I THINK. YOU DIDN'T PUT IT EXACTLY THIS WAY BUT. AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOCUS A. ON THIS HAT ADDRESSES ARE ISSUE OF INCOME OR IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUE OF INCOME INEQUALITY THAT IS GROWING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. IF WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THAT COHORT THAT TO THAT SADLY VERY LARGE COHORT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO FALL INTO THE LOWER INCOME. CATEGORIES. HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSURE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THOSE FOLKS HAVE BASIC CA BASELINE? A KEYBOARD COMPETENCY I'M SO THAT THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. HOW WILL THEY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS UP TO THE TO THE CHALLENGE AND A? THE INTERNET CONNECTION WHICH I PRESUME NEEDS TO BE HIGH SPEED UP THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE. A. AS BROADLY AS WE WOULD LIKE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU AT SOME POINT IN THIS PROCESS TO. POINT TO THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT AND DEMONSTRATED FOR US SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT. I HAVE A. FAIRLY SIMPLISTIC. FRANKLY UNDERSTANDING OF ONLINE LEARNING AND WHAT IT MEANS PART OF IT'S BASED ON WATCHING MY SON. TAKE A PARAMEDIC COURSE. OUT OF UCLA FOR HIM WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. BUT THAT LEADS ME TO ANOTHER QUESTION. IN THAT COURSE AND I AM QUITE CERTAIN AND. MANY COURSES THAT ARE TEACHING SKILLS TRAINING. A LOT OF THE TRAINING IS HANDS ON YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT AND IN FRONT OF A MONITOR YOU NEED. AND HIS CASE HE NEEDS TO BE IN FRONT OF A. CADAVER FOR SOME OF THE. SOME OF THE WORK THAT THAT SOME OF THE LEARNING THAT THEY DO AND IF YOUR ON TEACHING SKILLS IN THE IN THE TRADES YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE TOOLS AND LEARN HOW TO MANIPULATE THEM OR. WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRAINING FOR SO HOW DO YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL THE OUT THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME BY. MY OFFICE SO WE CAN. I DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND OTHERS. I'M. BUT. IF FATHER AND I I. DON'T THINK THERE'S SIR OF A QUESTION THAT TO IT IS WHAT YOU INTEND IF IF THIS IS INTENDED TO BE. A BULWARK AGAINST THE NEXT RECESSION AND FUTURE RECESSIONS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SEEMS A LONG WAY OFF GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE ECONOMIC CA. ANALYSES THAT FTA A THAT I'VE SEEN AND SO. WHY WILL IT TAKE THAT LONG? AND MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD DUH THE OF THE TIME THE TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. BUT DE A SEVEN YEAR. RUN UP SOUNDS LIKE A VERY LONG. TIME TO ME. I I THINK SOME OF THE. UNDERLYING. ECONOMIC GOALS I ONE OF AYE AYE ONE UNDERSTAND. BETTER. AND I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT I. I I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO WITH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. IS. TEACH SKILLS OUTSIDE THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING. IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE STATE AND MATCH UP. THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS TO FILL THOSE JOBS RAISING. OF THEM IN THE ECONOMY AND THEIR INCOME CAPACITY. I IN THE PROCESS. I DID HAVE ONE OTHER. QUESTION ABOUT. HOW YOU'LL MEASURE? OF SUCCESS AND YOU SAID THAT TO. THAT WAS BY MEASURING WHETHER OR NOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WAGE GAINS. I I COULD SEE THAT AS A MACRO MEASUREMENTS BUT NOT AS A MICRO MEASUREMENT FOR. IT THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED HERE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU YOU'RE ABLE TO ONE INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS REALLY. MEASURE THAT TO ME IT'S THE ACQUISITION OF. A OF SKILLS. SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WAS ACTUALLY ACQUIRED SKILLS THROUGH. SOME KIND OF TESTING CA A PROTOCOL WHETHER THAT'S ON THE JOB OR. OR OR THROUGH TRADITIONAL TESTING. AND IT. OR MAYBE THROUGHOUT THE FACT IS THAT THOSE THOSE ARE THAT THE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS THAT. THAT I HAVE TODAY. OKAY MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU HAVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. MISTER BLOOM. HAPPY PROVIDED AND. FOR ALL OF. YOU WANT IT KNOW THAT HAVE ANY OF THEM ADDRESSED HER. JUST LAYING ABOUT THEIR FOR THE FUTURE I THINK GOD JUST PUTTING THE QUESTIONS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE VERY EARLY IN THIS FOCUS AREA AND. THAT IS THROUGH DR. THANK YOU AND I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN. TO MY GOOD FARMERS HAD A LOT I DO BELIEVE WE ARE EARLY IN THIS PROCESS TO. I MEAN I I THINK NO ONE HERE IS QUESTIONING AYE YOUR DEDICATION CLOSING CERTAINLY. THAT K. TWELVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BUT ALSO BEYOND THE KEY TWELVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS PERSISTENTLY HAS AND YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY. AYE WITH ME IN LONG BEACH. SHOWS YOU'RE VERY DEDICATED. TO STUDENTS OF ALL AGES IN CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE THEM THAT I KNOW OF YOU SO THAT THAT FOR SURE. BUT AGAIN ONE OF MY CONCERNS HERE I'M JUST NOT. DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE THAT THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS. AND I THINK. WHEN YOU USE THE WORD FAITH AND I THINK WE ARE. IF WE ARE TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FAITH BECAUSE AGAIN I I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING OR WHERE CAN END UP. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I'M COMPETITION BECAME A GOOD COMPETITION CANNOT BE GOOD I MEAN IF COMPETITION IS. I'D I SERVE STUDENTS THE BEST THAT'S GOOD OF ITS COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES THAT'S NOT GOOD THAT'S WHY WONDER WHERE WE GO DOWN THE ROAD. WHERE WHERE DOES THIS END UP I MEAN WHO WILL TEACH THESE CLASSES? IS THE YOU KNOW YOU SAID NO PRIVATIZATION I MEAN THERE'S NOT GOOD SOME PRIVATE OPERATOR IN TEXAS. SOMEONE IN A ROOM OPERATING A COMPUTER. A BODY WHATEVER THEY CAUGHT NOWADAYS RIGHT. TEACHING A CLASS UNTIL WE THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I WANT SOME IS CONNECTED TO THE STATE. AND CONNECTED TO SERVING THE STUDENTS SO SO YOU MEAN A ANY CAN YOU COLONIES KNOWER OR NOT I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SWITCHED I THINK THESE ARE THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS WE TALK QUITE. A TALK ABOUT THIS HUNDRED FIFTEEN COLLEGE SERVING ON. THE SKILLS GAP. SO DOES THAT MEAN IT WOULD ONLY FOCUS ON THE SKILLS GAP OR WOULD IT TO GO INTO TEACHING GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. NO IS THAT WHERE THIS ULTIMATELY. COULD ADD UP IS THAT BEEN CONTEMPLATED. IS THERE SOME WALLED SET UP TO MAKE SURE THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN SHOULD HAPPEN. SO THOSE ARE JUST THE KIND OF THINGS THAT I WORRY ABOUT WHERE DOES THIS GO. BUSINESS AND THE AND BECOME THE BIGGEST COLLEGE AND YOU KNOW TAKE STUDENTS FROM OTHER COLLEGES WERE JUST PICK SOMEONE BIG ONLINE SYSTEM WHEN GUINNESS AND THEN SHARED. HERE I THINK. THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID TO TO TO EXPERIENCE AN INSTRUCTOR FIRSTHAND AND IN CONDUCTING HANDS ON LEARNING. SO WITH THAT ALL OF THE QUITE MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND GREAT IF NOT THAT'S OKAY TOO. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND IF THE CHAIR. WISHES. BUT SO. WHO WILL TEACH? CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY. THAT MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO TEACH THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CULTS OF. WE HAVE. HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS. OF FACULTY CREATING ONLINE CONTENT TODAY. MANY OF THEM IN THE CAREER EDUCATION FEEL CREATING COMPETENCY BASED CONTACT. SO WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE. THE CONTENT EXPERTISE ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM. AND WE WANNA GIVE THOSE FACULTY AND OPPORTUNITY TO SCALE. WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING? TWO IN TERMS OF COMPETITION. THE. THIS PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM IS FOCUSED ON MICRO PRETENSIONS. JOB SKILLS. WE ALREADY HAVE THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE IT IS CREATING OF IS AGGREGATING ALL OF THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. ONLINE CONTENT AND AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT. AND THAT IS SUPPORTED THROUGH A PROCESS OF. A PARTNERING WITH THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN. SO. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATED BEFORE. BUT. I JUST ADDS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA FOR ONLINE COURSES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUTE BECAUSE. ITIS GROWING MORE RAPIDLY THE NUMBER OF UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING ONLINE. IS OUT PACING THE NUMBER OF UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING IN A BRICK AND MORTAR. AND WILL SURPASS THAT IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT. SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CREATE SOMETHING HERE STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE. TO GRAVITATE TOWARD THOSE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS NOT TO YOUR QUESTION AND AND TO. MEMBER BLUM'S QUESTION ABOUT HANDS ON LEARNING ABSOLUTELY. WE RECOGNIZE. THAT IN A COMPETENCY BASED MODEL SOME OF THOSE COMPETENCIES ARE ARE ARE MEASURED BASED ON. THE STUDENT'S ABILITY TO MASTER THE CONTENT ONLINE. OR IN A PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM SOME OF IT HAS TO BE DEMONSTRATED HANDS ON. THAT'S WHY WE ARE BUILDING THE PARTNERSHIPS NOW. BETWEEN LABOR. AND YOU KNOW I WON'T SPEAK FOR THEM THEY CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT THERE IS A NEED. WITH EMPLOYERS. AND SO WE SAID WE PUT IN FRONT OF YOUR YOUR. SEATS. A LIST OF VARIOUS EVENTS WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS THAT WERE WORKING WITH TO THINK THROUGH AND DESIGNED THESE PATHWAYS. THESE PATHWAYS ARE ALREADY IN MANY CASES BEING TAUGHT TODAY JUST ON A SMALLER SCALE. OF FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AT CI YOU ONE THOUSAND IS CREATED. COUPLE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE COMPETENCY BASED THAT ALLOW THEIR MEMBERS TO GAIN CERTAIN SKILLS THAT ALLOW THEM PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. SECURELY IN THE IT FIELD. SO WE WANT TO DO WITH SCALE THAT. SO THIS INSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING THIS IS NOT SOMETHING BRAND NEW THIS IS JUST THAT'S UP AND THAT WE HAVE INTENTIONALLY. TRY TO PULL TOGETHER AND WHY A NEW COLLEGE. WE HAVE A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. WE GOT TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES BECAUSE WE FELT THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO BE SERVED. WHETHER THAT'S COASTLINE COLLEGE WHICH IS THE COLLEGE WITHOUT WALLS IN ORANGE COUNTY. OR THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON WHAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE OUR NEWEST COLLEGE IN MADERA. THERE IS A NEAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE. WE'RE ORGANIZED ITS WAY. ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING SERVING ONE MORE ADDITIONAL NEED. AND SO. AND THEN FINALLY THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT. WHY DO WE NEED TO START FROM? AND I APPRECIATE. THAT QUESTION AND A COMMENT. ARE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES AND I I YOU KNOW RESPECTFULLY I KNOW THAT. A CHAIR MEDINA YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE'RE COLLEGES OPERATE YOU HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCE IN OUR COLLEGE THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE FACULTY ARE DEDICATED TO THE MISSION THAT THEY SERVE. WE WANT THE HUNDRED FIFTEEN COLLEGE TO BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON ADULT LEARNERS. THE INDIVIDUALS WORKING AND BREATHING AND THE FACULTY WORKING AT THE ONLINE COLLEGE. SOLELY FOCUSED ON ADULT LEARNERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT KIND OF EFFORT IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES. THAT EXIST FOR THESE WORKERS. SO. HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS IF I MISSED ANY BE HAPPY TO COME BACK. TRY TO GET TO THOSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARTZ ITCHY. THANK YOU CHANCE OAKLEY I. APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION. AND YOUR. DESIRE TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AND UP YOU KNOW WHERE AN ESTATE WERE WERE PROUD OF OUR INNOVATION ECONOMY AND. YOU KNOW CONCEPTUALLY JUST SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT IT. WE KNOW ALL OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IS HEADED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AND AND WE WE TALKED IN OUR OFFICE THAT TO YOU ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR. FRIENDS IN LABOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED. BUT IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE. SOONER OR LATER WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE GOING TO TOWARD THIS DIRECTION AND IT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW. OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENT OUR CURRENT STUDENTS. APPEAR TO BE MOVING A TOWARD THAT DIRECTION AND IN TERMS OF THEIR ONLINE. COURSE IN ROMANTIC. I. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR LAST FEW COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY START TO ADDRESS SOME OF MY. QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON THE ISSUE OF WHY WE NEED A WHOLE NEW ONLINE COMMITTEE COLLEGE. RATHER THAN JUST EXPANDING EXISTING ONLINE PROGRAMS YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED. THAT THIS IS TRYING TO MEET A REAL NEED AND AND THAT THAT NEED IS TO FOCUS ON. THOSE. STRANDED WORKERS. BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. A NEW. ONLINE COMMITTEE COLLEGE RATHER THAN EXPANDING EXISTING ONLINE PROGRAMS. IS NECESSARY TO. IN OF ME THE DE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE STRAND WORKERS. SO. DID TO SPECIFICALLY TO THAT QUESTION. AND AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. BUT AS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF. A VERY WELL RESPECTED COLLEGE WHO DID GREAT WORK FOR THE GREATER LONG BEACH AREA. I RECOGNIZE THAT. OUR COLLEGES ARE SERVING MANY MISSIONS. THERE ARE SOMETIMES OVERWHELMED BY THE NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I'M WE ARE ASKING THEM TO CONTINUOUSLY DO MORE THEN WE EXPRESSED CONCERN. ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDENTS. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE OUTCOMES OF OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TO ME BECAUSE YSTEM ARE NOT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. NOT WEAR ANY OF US WANT TO BE THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF OUR FACULTY OR COLLEGES OR OUR STAFF. AT THE CRITICISM OF HOW MUCH WE'RE ASKING EACH AND EVERY. OF THOSE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO DO. SO I WANT OUR COLLEGES TO HAVE THE SPACE AND THE FUNDING AND THE FOCUS TO SERVE THEIR PRIMARY MISSIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND TO ADD CAPACITY TO THE SYSTEM BY ALLOWING FOR THIS THIS NEW. ENTITY. TO SUPPORT THAT CAPACITY BUILDING. SO. I THINK WE'VE HAD MANY. MANY EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT. OUR HISTORY THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHERE WE'VE SAID WELL LET'S JUST GIVE THE COMMUNICATIVE IT'S ANOTHER. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND LET THEM GO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. I THINK ADULT EDUCATE OUR DULL BASIC EDUCATION IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. WE ALL CARE ABOUT ADULT BASIC EDUCATION. WE PUT MONEY TOWARD A BASIC IT'S GOOD. I THINK VERY FEW OF US WOULD. ARGUE THAT ADULT BASIC EDUCATION IS NOT WORKING WHY. BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO PILE ON. HI I WONDER HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES ASKING NOT ONLY TO DEAL WITH THE PIPELINE STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE. TO TRY AND REACH. ANOTHER CO HER STUDENT YES THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE OF DOING THAT BUT WORK BUT WE WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE THE CAPACITY REACH SCALE. IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE'RE REACHING TODAY. THAT IS MY CONCERN. SCALE WHICH WE NEED TO REACH IN ORDER TO SERVE. THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS OF THESE WORKERS. COULD WE INVEST HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES OF COURSE RICK. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT INVESTMENT WOULD PRODUCE THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED IS A STATE. AS GREAT AS OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES ARE BECAUSE THAT MONEY WILL BE DISPERSED. THERE WILL BE NO CENTRAL AREA TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. AT LEAST WITH THIS. ENTITY YOU HAVE DIRECT. OVERSIGHT. OF ONE COLLEGE THAT IS GEARED TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING ONE PRIMARY GOAL. THAT IS TO UP SKILL WORKERS IN THE WORKFORCE. THANK YOU SO MEMORY CHAVEZ. THANK YOU. I LIKE TO GO TO THE LA EL. IN YOUR REPORT. ON. I KNOW YOU IT YEAH SKIP TO ONE THROUGH FIVE BUT I'M GONNA GO BACK TO. PAGE TWO. AND WHEN YOUR COMMENTS A SAYS ENROLLING IN ONLINE COURSES OUTSIDE OF HOME DISTRICT IS DIFFICULT. STUDENTS MUST APPLY SEPARATELY FOR ADMISSIONS TO EACH COLLEGE. AND REGISTER FOR EACH CLASS SEPARATELY. THEN ON PAGE FIVE YOU GO DOWN SAY. THE MINISTRATION OFF DOES NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WORKING ADULTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MORE. EDUCATION. CANNOT ACCESS IT THROUGH JUSTIN ONLINE OR IN PERSON. COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SURE LIKE THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER THE DIRECT QUESTION YOU SERVERS. DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRESENTATION OF THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. MEN AND WOMEN AGES TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR ARE STRANDED WORKERS YOU AGREE WITH HIS NUMBERS. RIGHT ARE IRONIES BUT THE CONCERNS THAT THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION NUMBER AT THE GOOD FAITH FUND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. SO DO YOU. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT THERE'S. PEOPLE THAT NEED SOME. SKILLS TO BE. TERM I BELIEVE HIS WAGE. HAVE A WAGE GAIN. YES THAT'S RIGHT. SO. MY QUESTION IS ANDY YOU GREED THAT THERE'S A NEED IS YOUR ISSUE IS THAT. NOT THE WHY BUT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS AND HOW EASE ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM IS LIKE WELL I THINK OUR CONCERN IS WE DON'T. WIRE THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TO THAT MILLION WORKERS NOT. WHAT WHY HAVE THEY NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT POST SECONDARY AT? WHAT HAVE BEEN THE BARRIER FOR THAT I THINK WE DON'T? I DON'T THINK THAT WE FOR ANYBODY GIVE US A GOOD REASON FOR WHAT WITH THAT WITH THE CASE. IN IN IN GENERAL WHAT WENT ON BUT ONLINE EDUCATION ISSUES RIGHT NOW IN IN THE COMMUTE COST ESTIMATES STUDENTS WHO ARE OTHER WHITE HOUSE RD ENROLLED THEY'RE TAKING A COURSE OR TWO. TO COMPLEMENT THEIR IN PERSON COURSES THEY MIGHT HELP THEM WITH NOT HAVING TO COMMUTE A DAY MIGHT HELP THEM WITH MAYBE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A COURSE THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT DOING CONFLICTS WITH HELPING. STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S BE ABLE TO ACCESS OTHER COURSE OF THE MY HOPE DEMS DUE TO THE PROFIT THAT'S A GOOD THING NOTHING VISITING WRONG WITH THAT. I THINK ARE OUR CONCERN IS. WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE REASON THAT THAT THAT THAT THE TWO POINT BY MILLION ADULTS ARE NOT ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE IT IS BECAUSE. I THE COURSES THAT WERE AVAILABLE ARE NOT ARE ARE NOT. WILLING TO THEM THAT THEY ARE THEIR MAIN CHALLENGE IS THAT THEY DON'T CAN'T GET TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE I MEAN IF IF THAT WAS THE CASE OF ISSUE WITH ACCESS I HAVE TIME TO DRIVE TO A COLLEGE AND AN ONLINE PROGRAM. WE WOULD WE WOULD BE OKAY THINKING THAT WE MIGHT BE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REAL COSTS ARE. PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FULL TIME AND HAVE FAMILIES. IT EVEN IF YOU CAN. OPEN UP THE COMPUTER AND AND TAKE A COURSE. IT'S STILL DIFFICULT PICKED A LOT OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY TO TAKE IT TO COURT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE NOT BE ENROLLING BECAUSE THEIR LIVES ARE JUST. BUT THEY HAVE A LOT GOING ON AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ALSO TAKE THE EXTRA COURSES I THINK THAT. THAT THAT ANOTHER ANOTHER. POSSIBLY GOING ON I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRIED IN ANY CASE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS WHY THESE FOLKS ARE NOT CURRENTLY. IN THE SYSTEM AND LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE AND THEN LET'S FIX THOSE PROBLEMS WE ARE WE ARE. THE PROPOSAL IS HERE IS AN ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE'RE PRESUMING THAT THIS IS THE SOLUTION THAT IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE TH. TO THIS PROGRAM IN IN THEIR. IN THEIR HOME THEN THEY'RE GONNA TO BE ENROLLED IN ANNOUNCED ON THE PATH THE BARRIER FOR MANY OF THEM THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD WANT TO TAKE WHAT WHAT THEIR COURSE THEY MIGHT. NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE ALL OF THE OF THE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT I CAN BENEFIT FROM MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO SORT OF. REACH OUT TO THOSE FOLKS AND AND PROVIDE THEM SOME ADVICE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE ENTERING THE SYSTEM. THAT YOU COULD CONCEIVE OF A NUMBER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BUT THE BUT THE WAY THE WAY YOU APPROACH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK THE MAIN ROUTE ISSUE. SO YOUR ISSUE AS IT USED. YOU RECOGNIZE THERE'S NO MAYBE A NEED BUT THE SOLUTION TO TO THIS NEED. YOU'RE NOT. CONVINCED YET THAT THIS SOLUTION IS MITCHELL NAY LEFT IRAQ OKAY NOW IN YOUR RESEARCH HAVE YOU. LOOKED AT. OTHER INSTITUTIONS WERE FULL TIME WORKERS PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE. HAVE. ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES LIKE THIS YEAR RESEARCH HAVE YOU SEEN. WORD. THEIR SOLUTION IS IS BEING UNDERTAKEN. YEAH I THINK WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE DONE AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY I THINK THE HARD PART IS WHAT. COMPARE THE LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT PEOPLE BEEN REFERRING TO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN ARIZONA STATE PROGRAM. THERE'S WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY BOTH PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY THOSE ARE BATTERERS PROGRAMS SO YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY OKAY THAT'S THE. SORT LET'S LOOK AT THAT AND LET'S LET'S USE THAT OF THE MODEL BECAUSE THAT IS. IT IF THAT IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT I'M KIND OF PROGRAM. GETTING STUDENTS ON THE WAY TO ABOUT THE DEGREE NOT NECESSARILY THE THESE KIND OF SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT ARE TIED INDUSTRY NEED. WHAT ASK YOU SIR TO LOOK AT? IN THE MILITARY. BECAUSE THE MILITARY ONES RUNS ONE PROBABLY THE A WORLDWIDE ONLINE SYSTEM. FOR PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY. TO GIVE THEM CERTIFICATE SKILLS. TO AFFORD VANCE MEANT. AND SO THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE IDEA ME DISADVANTAGED ACT AIDS. BECAUSE IN THE MILITARY HAVE PEOPLE TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD WHEN DAVID BEING CALIFORNIA NEXT DAY THEY COULD BE IN JAPAN. BUT THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN CONTINUE TRAVELING IN AND GET THEIR CERTIFICATES AND SKILLS AS AN ONLINE PROGRAM. SO THIS THIS IS HAPPENING. SO. IF WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE NEED I JUST LIKE TO. PRESENT THAT TO EVERYONE THAT MAY BE AN OPTION REALLY DID LOOK AT NOW BACK TO. THE CHANCELLOR YOU KNOW WE YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS. FOR ECADES NUMBER DOT DECADES BUT YEARS. SEEMS LIKE DECADES AND AND I'VE UP AS YOU AND I'VE TALKED MY OWN US. UNICOLOR JUST CONCERNED WITH IT. MY FIRST QUESTION YOU. PARTNERSHIP. YOU'RE NOT CAN BE UNDER THIS ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT PARTNERSHIP. IS ANY YET ME PARTNERSHER TODAY OR ANYBODY THAT'S SIGN ON THIS THING LABOR UNIONS OR YES I THINK WE HAVE SEVERAL PARTNERS HERE TODAY AND THAT HE IS ANYWAY. PARTNERING HERE STAND UP I KNOW SOMEBODY THERE. THEY'RE ALL OUTSIDE. ABOUT. A. I DON'T BLAME HIM THE YEAH. THE. IT I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL IT IS BEST WHEN YOU LOOK AT CERTIFICATES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. A BA OF. BA IN FRENCH LITERATURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SKILLED A. TO GET A JOB ON THE WAGE ISSUE. FIVE UP I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE OTHER PARTNERSHIP DEMAND. I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORKING GROUP ON THIS. BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO MY PEOPLE AND THEY'RE ON THE WORKING GROUP. HOUSE ADVANCING I KNOW THERE. WHEN YOU PUT THIS GROUP TOGETHER SOME PEOPLE SAYING HELL NO WE WON'T GO IN THAT WE HAD THE OTHER PEOPLE SAYING THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WHERE'S THAT RIGHT NOW. SO. NOT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE NEXT ITEM BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL WORKING GROUPS THAT MOST OF WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE FUNDING FORMULA BUT. THERE IT'S BEEN A GROUP OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER TO PUT TOGETHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. A LED BY THE PRESIDENT COASTLINE COLLEGE SHE JUST. I JUST SAW THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. THE INPUT IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM OUR COLLEGES ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER PARTNER WITH THEM WERE. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED PARTNERSHIPS WITH LABOR AND WITH EMPLOYERS. WE RECOGNIZE WE NEED PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COLLEGES SOME COLLEGES. BUT YOU THOSE IN IN YOUR DISTRICT. MEMBER CHáVEZ ARE DOING A GREAT WORK OF SERVING LOCAL NEEDS. SO. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO HEARING HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT. THOSE COLLEGES IF YOU CONSIDER THE TESTIMONY AT THE SENATE HEARING. THERE WERE TWO COLLEGE PRESIDENTS THERE WHO MADE A VERY COMPELLING CASE IS WHY THIS WOULD SUPPORT THEIR COLLEGES IN GROWING THEIR CAPACITY. SO WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE CRITICAL. WE ARE DEVELOPINGTHOSE PARTNERSHIPS AS WE SPEAK AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM MANY OF OUR PARTNERS DURING PUBLIC TESTIMONY. SO THIS ISN'T A ESTO PIE. INTERNAL. GIVEN THE DONE JUST BY YOU AND YOUR EXECUTIVE STAFF THIS ACTUALLY READS ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST WITH YOUR COLLEGES BUT ALSO. TRADE INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES AND EVERYBODY ELSE FOR ABSOLUTELY THIS THIS IDEA ACTUALLY DIDN'T COME FROM MY STAFF. I KNOW SOME OF THEM UP COME KICKING AND SCREAMING TO THIS IDEA BUT. BUT NO SERIOUSLY. THIS IDEA CAME FROM OUR LABOR PARTNERS. WHO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH WITH MANY YEARS HO ARE FRUSTRATED THAT THEY SEE THE DIRECTION THAT THE ECONOMY IS TAKING THEIR WORKERS? AND HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING THEIR OWN LOCAL PROGRAMS. COMPETENCY BASED. SO. WE'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE A SCALABLE SOLUTION TOO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING TO US OVER THE YEARS AND I THINK YOU HERE FOR SOME OF THAT. IN THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY WE COULDN'T TELL OR HIT THE SWEET SPOT BECAUSE IN THE DIET STARTS. TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES MISSTATED IN AREAS OF CONCERN VIA THIS MEET UP SHEET YOU HAVE RIGHT HERE THAT THESE ARE HEARINGS GOING AROUND THE STATE THAT THE. YES THOSE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES. THAT ARE SPONSORED YOU SEE THE HOST ALL SORTS OF VARIETY OPPOSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK AND IF THIS THIS TOPIC OF THE FUTURE OF WORK IS SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO MANY OF OUR PARTNERS. AND US SO WE HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING TOGETHER. FOLKS FROM ALL SORTS OF SPECTRUM OF FOR EMPLOYERS TO A EDUCATORS TO. RESEARCHERS TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP. THE PATHWAYS FOR. TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT EVERYBODY HAS BUT THE FUTURE OF WORK. OKAY APRIL SECOND SAN DIEGO'S MONDAY WILL BE UP HERE. CAUSING OTHER PROBLEMS BUT THE I WOULD LIKE. TO MAKE SURE MY CHIEF OF STAFF YOU ARE WELCOME TO US AND THE. YOUR ENTIRE DISTRICT STAFF. BLASTING OUT JUST MAKE A COMMENT IS. CHANGE IS ALWAYS TOUGH. AND NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF EQUITY. PARTICULAR FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TRULY DEAL WITH EQUITY. IS TO EDUCATION. YESTERDAY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR I MADE A COMMENT THAT. MY FATHER WHO HAD A THIRD GRADE EDUCATION WHOSE WORK IN THE FIELD IN WORLD WAR TWO STARTED. WHEN OFTEN THE COURT CAME BACK WAS WORKING AT U. S. STILL. AND BECAUSE OF. EL CAMINO JUNIOR COLLEGE. AT NIGHT. HE WAS ABLE TO GET SOME SKILLS NINETY DEGREE. SKILLS TO WORK IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND ALLOW US TO MOVE FROM THE BODY ó. TO TORRANCE CALIFORNIA WE HAD SIDEWALKS SO THE. THIS IS NOT THE NEW OF HOW WE'RE TRYING TO MEET DID THE EQUITY ISSUE OF JOBS. FOR PEOPLE SO. AS I STATED MY BEGINNING COMMENTS. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE YOU OFTEN CAN'T DO THIS. THIS IS NOT ANYTHING NEW. DF MY FATHER HAD TO GO TO EL CAMINO JUNIOR COLLEGES THEY DIDN'T HAVE COMPUTERS THAT HE COULD DO IT IN HIS HOUSE. BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE MILITARY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE ON SHIPS WHEN YOU'RE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS. STILL ABOUT CONTINUING YOUR EDUCATION FOR ADVANCEMENTS WAGE EARNERS YOU DON'T GET A CERTIFICATE YOU DON'T GET PROMOTED YOU DON'T GET PROMOTED YOU GET KICKED OUT. SO IT'S A NUMBER OUT SYSTEM SO THIS IS. A VERY GOOD STEP IN THE DIRECTION JUST CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY AND HAVE PEOPLE PART OF IT I THINK YOU DOING THAT WITH THIS. THESE MEETUPS AROUND THE STATE AND. I'M SUPPORTIVE YOU GOING FORWARD IN AN INTRIGUED BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SIR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND THINK YOU. CAN'T TURN OTHERS FOR BEING HERE I DO HAVE AT LEAST FIVE QUESTIONS I WANT TO WARN THE CHAIR THAT I HAVE COUPLE OF GUN TO ASK AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED AROUND SUCCESS. I THINK THAT TO AYE WE HEARD FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND I MONICA AS WELL THAT. HOW WE DEFINE SUCCESS IS IMPORTANT AND I KNOW YOU'VE SHARED ON SOME METRICS? OF HOW THAT IS DEFINED ONE OF THEM BEING WAGE INCREASES ON AT BASS THAT'S CORONATION ALL BREAK IT'S NOT EXACTLY YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY SAY THAT THAT'S THE CLASS BUT YOU CAN CORRELATE IT TO IT. BUT HOW WILL YOU YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS FOR AN ONLINE PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS. HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS AND HOW WE VIOLATE THAT CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO HOW WE EVALUATE CIGARETTES NOT JUST WITH THE METRICS OF SUCCESS ARE? SURE SO MUCH THE WAY WE MEASURE. SUCCESS TODAY IN THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO. AVAILABILITY OF DATA ON A HOUSE STUDENTS ARE PROGRESSING SO CALIFORNIA TO ME COLLEGES HAVE SEVERAL METRICS THAT WE USE. TYPICALLY CONTAINED IN OUR SCORECARD. SO WHILE THE. THIS PERSONALIZED VERY PLATFORM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. MARCHING TOWARD A ESOS HIS DEGREE OR A TYPICAL UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. STUDENTS STILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE MASTERING THE CONTENT. AND SO. JUST AS WE DO NOW. IN A TYPICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S DONE THROUGH A GRADING SYSTEM THAT'S DONE THROUGH PROGRESSION FROM ONE CLASS TO ANOTHER PERSISTENCE. AND THEN COMPLETION OF AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL. THOSE METRICS WOULD APPLY. TO THIS UP PLATFORM AS WELL. THE OTHER METRIC THAT WE'VE RECENTLY CREATED WHICH IS IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IS THIS ISSUE OF PLACEMENT IN THE JOB. AND GAINING A MEANINGFUL WAGE WE DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE DATA THAT WE NEED. IN ORDER TO PRODUCE. QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL. A BENEFITTED. THROUGH WAGE GAME. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BUILD THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EMPLOYERS AND. AND THE LABOR COMMUNITY. SO. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT WOULD BE VERY MUCH SIMILAR APPLICABLE MEASURES THAT WE USE FOR ANY OF ON AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ELEMENT. ARE ENCOMPASSES BASE SYSTEM BY THE WAY. YOU ONLY PROGRESS IF YOU MASTER THE CONTENT. SO THIS IS SELF PACED. IF A STUDENT MASTERS THE CONTENT THEN THEY MOVE FORWARD IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY CONTINUE. TO. ACCESS TO CONTENT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT UNTIL THEY MASTER AT SO. PART OF IT IS DEMONSTRATING THAT COMPETENCY WHICH IS IN A COMPLICATED SYSTEM IT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD EITHER THEY MASTER THE CONTENT OR THEY DON'T AND IF THEY DO THEY MOVE FORWARD. AND SO THAT'S HOW YOU. WHAT I'M HEARING IS HOW YOU AND MEASURE OR DO THERE ARE TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL STUDENT SUCCESS WHO HOW WILL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL? WITH THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AND THE ENTIRE INITIATIVE. WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT. WE WELCOME. ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR IDEAS THAT THIS BODY WOULD HAVE WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU ALL HAVE A IN TERMS OF HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS. AS A NEW INSTITUTION. SO. HOW WOULD WE MEASURE SUCCESS SO CERTAINLY IN THE NEAR TERM IT WOULD BE? A. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S DEMAND SO OUR STUDENTS ENROLLING. OUR PARTNERSHIPS BEING BUILT. DO WE HAVE EMPLOYER AND LABOR. PARTNERS WORKING ON THIS. HAVE WE ACCOMPLISH GETTING THE INSTITUTION OF CRIED ACCREDITED. AND OUR STUDENTS PROGRESSING NOT JUST TO WAGE GAME BUT ARE THEY PROGRESSING. IN TERMS OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES DO WE SEE OVER TIME. THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GAINING HIGHER LEVEL CREDENTIALS. THOSE ARE WAYS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO HOLD THIS NEW INSTITUTION ACCOUNTABLE. ARE THEY CREATING VALUE FOR CALIFORNIANS A AND ALSO. A ARE WE ENSURING THAT THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COLLEGES EXIST SO THAT WE DON'T. UNDERMINE ENROLLMENT OVER OTHER COLLEGES SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE CLEAR CRITERIA. IN TERMS OF HOW WE HOLD THE COLLEGE ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH THEIR PARTNER COLLEGES TO BUILD CAPACITY NOT TO CANNIBALIZE. I YOU DO YOU DESCRIBED THAT THIS CONVERSATION IN PAR IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF I HAD THE WORK FORCE. AND OF THE LABOR AND AND IN MY MIND I'D THERE IS A STRONG INTERSECTION BETWEEN WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION. AND BECAUSE I ALSO THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION I LOOK AND AT MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH IN THE LITERATURE OUT THERE THAT REMINDS US THAT NO MATTER WHAT INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS WE'VE. TRIED AND WE STILL CONTINUE TO SEE FRESH NARRATION LOW INCOME STUDENTS I'M WHO STRUGGLE NO MATTER WHAT THE MODEL IS. AND AND SO FROM THAT PLACE. I ASKED MYSELF WHY NOT A PILOT. WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE THE PROGRAM IT IS AND WHY NOT PILOT IT? I'M IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE MAY WANT TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE OR NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT TO GIVE US THE TIME TO UNDERSTAND LIKE IS THIS REALLY GOING TO WORK. SO I I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. AND IN MANY WAYS THE WAY THIS IS BEING DESIGNED CURRENTLY IS IN MANY WAYS A PILOT WE'VE BEEN ASKED. TO DEVELOP AT LEAST THREE PATHWAYS. TO ENROLL THE FIRST COHORT STUDENT. STUDENTS BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO I'M I WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE COMING BACK TO THIS BODY. AT A FUTURE TIME. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE MET THOSE GOALS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IF THAT'S THE PLEASURE OF THIS BODY. SO. WHETHER WE DO IT. FORMALLY AWARE THAT WE DO IT. INFORMALLY WHEN WE COME BACK TO YOU. AND YOU QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED INVESTMENT I THINK. WE ARE VERY OPEN TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE INITIAL COHORTS AND WE BE HAPPY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT BEST DONE. AT YOU WHEN THINKING ABOUT HIGHER ED AND AND. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HELP STUDENTS BE SUCCESSFUL SO ONE OF YOUR METRICS BOTH I'M FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS SUCCESS BUT ALSO FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUCCESS IS TO IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE STUDENTS WERE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. AND WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A MULTITUDE OF SERVICES INCLUDING TUTORING ADVISING OTHER SERVICES THAT HELP. THAT STUDENT BE SUCCESS. HOW IS THIS PROGRAM THIS IDEA OF GOING TO INCLUDE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE KNOW? STUDENTS NO MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE NONTRADITIONAL ADULT LEARNERS ARE EVEN KEEP YOUR TWELVE STUDENTS MEET IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WELL WE ARE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE WITH YOU THAT. THIS IN EVERY GROUP IS TO NICK COUNTER COLLEGES NEEDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. PARTICULARLY. INDIVIDUALS IN THIS. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT ADULT LEARNERS WILL NEED SUPPORT THEY WILL NEED AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE DEVELOP THESE PATHWAYS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE'VE PUT FORWARD TO DEVELOP THE PATHWAYS. THEY REQUIRE US TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS WITH THEIR LABOR EMPLOYERS TO CREATE THE MENTORSHIP THE COACHING. THE INTRUSIVE. SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT WE WILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS SUCCEED WE'VE SEEN MODELS OF THAT. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN PUBLIC. ONLINE PLATFORMS. WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW WITH THE CURRENT ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE AND HOW WE'RE EMBEDDING SUPPORT SERVICES IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DO THAT IN PARTICULAR ADD ONE MORE COMPONENT WHICH IS THAT COACHING AND MENTORING COMPONENT. THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY EITHER THE LABOR PARTNER OR THE EMPLOYER PARTNER BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS. FACE MANY MANY CHALLENGES. INCLUDING EQUIPMENT ACCESS TO BROADBAND. INTERNET SO IN AREAS WHERE THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE EMPLOYER FOR THE LABOR PARTY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A SPACE. WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO TO GAIN ACCESS TO BROADBAND EACH AND JUST TO BE CLEAR DOES THAT THEN MEAN THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PLAY IN THIS BECAUSE? I MEAN THEY CAN'T ALL TRAVEL TO. YES RIGHT YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. HER PUTTING FOURTEEN COLLEGES SO WHETHER OR NOT. THEY PROVIDE SPACE PROVIDE. PART TIME INSTRUCTORS FULL TIME INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE CONTENT THAT WE'RE DELIVERING. I WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY EXPECT A PARTNER WITH THEM. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE UP FRONT. THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT WE NEED FROM OUR LABOR PARTNERS EMPLOYER PARTNERS TO ENSURE IT IS THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ROLL. THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY AND AND THAT'S WHAT. YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY MY CONVERSATIONS ARE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS THEY EXPECT THAT OF US. AND IF REQUIRED THAT OF US IF THEY DO PARTNER WITH. THE OTHER THING IS IT IS JUST FOR CLARITY PURPOSES AND. IT THERE IS. FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DO WE EXPECT THAT THESE FEES ARE GOING TO BE ALIGNED OR IS THIS NEW BOARD AND NEW COLLEGE GOING TO ADAPT A DIFFERENT MODEL. AND THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT WE SEE IN PLACE FOR THE HUNDRED IMPORTANT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO FIRST OF ALL. THE FEE STRUCTURE WOULD BE CONSISTENT. WITH. THE COST OF EDUCATION IN THE CALIFORNIA TOO BECAUSE I THINK FINANCE. LAID THAT OUT. BECAUSE IT'S A COMPETENCY BASED MODEL WE WILL PROBABLY NEED LOOK AT ADAPTING. A FEE STRUCTURE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THE STUDENTS COME IN AND OUT. IN THIS MODEL STUDENTS CAN COME IN AND OUT WHENEVER THEY WANT BASICALLY THERE IS NO TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC CALENDAR. IT'S NOT A PER UNIT BASIS RIGHT NOW WE CHARGE PER UNIT. SO WE WOULD NEED TO ADOPT AND ADAPT FEE STRUCTURE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE FORTY SIX DOLLARS A UNIT FOR THIS MODEL SO WE WOULD BE WORKING. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL IT'S YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE LEGISLATURE SETS. OTHER FEATS FOR MUSICOLOGISTS SO WE WOULD NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT CONFORMS AND COMPORTS TO THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY ADOPTED. AND AS YOU THINK OF BOTH THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN IN THE LONG TERM HOW DO YOU DECIDE IF YOU EXPAND HOW DO YOU DECIDE IF THIS GROWS BIGGER AND WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION NOW. YOU KNOW INITIALLY AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S LIMITED PATHWAYS. VERY FOCUS BUT HOW DOES THAT DECISION IN THE LONG TERM AND FUTURE WORK. WELL I THINK. FIRST OF ALL. SIMILAR TO THE CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN NOW AT OUR COLLEGES. THERE. THE CURRICULUM DISCUSSIONS ARE LED BY THE FACULTY OF THAT COLLEGE SO IF THERE IS A. A DEMAND IN THAT NEEDS TO BE SERVED WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE CURRICULUM PROCESS WHICH TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT DEMAND. IF THERE ARE ANY. NEW ASPECTS OF THE BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR THAT. BUT. IN THE END WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT INVESTMENT FIRST THOUGH IF THERE IS A DESIRE AND A DEMAND TO EXPAND AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ONLINE OFFERINGS. IN A TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE FRAMEWORK THAT WE WOULD BE RELYING ON THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE TO REACH THAT THE MAN. SO I WE THINK THE TWO CAN WORK IN CONCERT WITH A WE ALREADY HAVE ONE MECHANISM FOR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION ONLINE WE WANNA CONTINUE TO GROW THAT. IN THIS GIVES IS JUST ONE MORE TOOL BUT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE SAME PROCESS FOR REQUESTING EXPANSION AS WE DO NOW. THANK YOU AND I MEAN JUST IN CLOSING AS A COMMENT I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS I'M IF YOU KNOW INTERNALLY AMONGST MEMBERS. AND WE'VE WE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AS WELL AND I THINK WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND YOU KNOW THE ESSENCE OF THIS THIS IS ABOUT GETTING NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. ENROLLED AND CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGE RIGHT AYE I GET THAT I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEIR. I ALSO THINK THAT. SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND HESITATION COME FROM A PLACE OF ALSO WATCHING MULTIPLE MODELS IN EDUCATION AND TRIED AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE FIRSTHAND ORATION. STUDENTS WHO HAVE A NEED TO WORK IN A FULL TIME STRUGGLE IN ALL OF THESE MODELS SO I RAISE THESE QUESTIONS AND I'M YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE PARTLY QUESTIONS SLASH CONCERNS OF RIGHT TERMS OF WHAT I'M THINKING. SIMPLY AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THIS MODEL WHILE GREAT INTENT DOESN'T LEAVE BEHIND THE STUDENT THAT EVERY OTHER MODEL HAS LEFT BEHIND IN CALIFORNIA AMEND ACTUALLY OUR COUNTRY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THERE SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CONCERN IS AND NOT A CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE OR ADAPT TO YOU KNOW NEW LEARNING STYLES. THAT I CAN FOLLOW BUT AND IT IS A CONCERN OF. HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO WORK FOR THE STUDENTS THAT? YOU KNOW. HAVE A HISTORY OF IT IS A FAIR NOT EARNING WELL SO YEAH BECAUSE THE MODEL DOESN'T WORK SO THAT I THINK I THINK YOU. COULD AMERICAN AYE NETS YET CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK YOUR POINT OF WOULD YOU KNOW REITERATE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT SPECIFICALLY WILL BE LOOKING AT. ITEMS SUCH AS ARE THEIR DISPARITIES IN THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THIS COLLEGE AND WILL BE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CONSTANTLY. AT NEW STRATEGIES TO ENSURE IT THAT IS OCCURRING THAT WE ADDRESS IT INSTANTLY AND THAT THE COLLEGE TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT FROM THE START AND IS REVIEWING IT. CONSTANTLY GREAT THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE IS RESEARCH NOW THAT FIRST AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE NOT DOING WELL ON ONLINE YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WORKS FOR SOME AND IT DOESN'T WORK FOR OTHERS SO. THERE IS ALREADY STAFF THERE THAT TEST YOU KNOW THAT TELLS US AND YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE RAISING THESE QUESTIONS SO. THANK YOU THOUGH. MR MEDINA. THANK YOU. AS AND THANK YOU MS LOW MOAN AS I AM LISTENING HERE. TO THE. DISCUSSION. IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE CONCERNS ARE. AND THREE THREE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. FIRST ONE I I WOULD SAY IS. ONE THAT WE JUST HAD A DISCUSSION ON. THE. PETTY GOLLY GEE. OF OR THE WAY WE REACH STUDENTS THE WAY WE TEACH. AND. AND AS A MISTER CHAVEZ WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE MILITARY. AN ONLINE AYE AYE REMEMBERING MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND ARMY ROTC. AND I LEARNED TO TAKE APART AND PUT TOGETHER THE M. ONE RIFLE THAT'S HOW OLD. FOR LONG AGO. I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS THE M. ONE RIFLE. BUT IF I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE APART AND PUT TOGETHER THE M. ONE RIFLE I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE LEARNED HOW TO HAVE DONE THAT. ONLINE. AND AND. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY TEACHES THOSE KIND OF THINGS ONLINE. AND AND THOSE SO THAT GOES TO THE QUESTION OF HOW. YOU LEARN. AND HOW INDIVIDUALS LEARN AND THE NEED FOR HANDS ON. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST CATEGORY. YOU KNOW OUR OURS ARE LEARNERS REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR PHONES. TO A ACCESS EDUCATION IS THIS. A. I'M NOT. IS THIS LITTLE DEVICE ENOUGH WAY TO LEARN PERHAPS COMPLICATED INFORMATION. AND THAT THAT GOES ALSO TO. ACCESS. SO THAT THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION THAT IT'S IN MY MIND. THE SECOND IS AS WE'VE MENTIONED GOVERNMENTS. ACCREDITATION. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THIS ENTITY TO GET ACCREDITED? WHO DOES IT COMPETE WITH? AND I THINK THE THIRD IS FINANCE WHERE WHERE DOES THIS. COME MAN WITH THE. WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS THIS TAKING MONEY FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT IS IS TAKING MONEY FROM A. FOR MOTHER FOR FROM OTHER COLLEGES FINANCE WANTS TO RESPOND. TO THE FUNDING FOR ABOUT NINETY EIGHT ON THAT THE FUNDING ASPECT THE PROPOSED HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION. AYE IT'S WITHIN THE SPORT THAT IT'S ABOUT PROVIDED FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT IT'S NOT DIRECTLY TAKEN OUT OF ANOTHER ALLOCATION THAT'S EXISTING. OR THAT IT'S. NOW PROPOSED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY SO WITH STRUCTURED BOTH THE LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THE FUNDING. SHE SAY THAT NOW THAT WE'VE SEEING SOME. AVAILABLE FUNDING WITHIN THAT AT SPLIT THE WE WERE USING IT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WE'VE SAID VERY CLEARLY IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE INTENT MOVING FORWARD. IS THAT IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS COLLEGE SAY VIA FTP ELSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERATE SEPARATE FROM FUNDING FOR ALL OF THE OTHER COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT WERE NOT IMPACTING. ENROLLMENT OR GROWTH WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. A. TO THE TO THE QUESTION OF GOVERNANCE. CREDIT TATIAN. SO. ACCREDITATION ó WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS NOW WITH. OUR CREDITORS. ACC JC AS WELL AS OTHER CREDITORS TO WHAT'S. ANSWERING THESE QUICK ASKING AND ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS OF THEIR CERTAINLY. THE ACCREDITATION THAT ARE HUNDRED FOR EIGHTEEN COLLEGES TRADITIONALLY PURSUE WHICH WE WOULD PURSUE. WEARING CONVERSATION THEY SEE SEE JC ABOUT HOW QUICKLY WE CAN MOVE TO THAN WHAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE AS WELL AS WE'RE LOOKING. AT AT THE OPTIONS OFFERED THROUGH WHAT'S. FOUR PREDATION OF. CERTIFICATE COURSE. WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE. DEGREE COURSES SO WE ARE EXPLORING BOTH WITH WATCHED AND WITH A C. JC. ó WE THINK WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THAT PROCESS RELATIVELY QUICKLY. AND WE FULLY EXPECT TO BE FULLY A FULLY ACCREDITED AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM ALL THE BENEFITS NOT ONLY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. TO THE FIRST QUESTION OF PEDAGOGY. IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN. SO. MEMBER MEDINA AYE AYE I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT. THE IPHONE. CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE A REPLACEMENT. FOR. EDUCATION. BROUGHT TO US BY OUR FULLY COMMITTED. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTORS. THAT THE CHALLENGE IS. INTEREST WELL LET ME SAY THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THE IPHONE WOULD BE THE PLACE TO LEARN. A COMPLICATED SUBJECT GROWTH SUBJECT THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE. INSTRUCTION. BUT CAN BE A PLACE TO LEARN SOFT SKILLS. IT CAN BE A PLACE TO MASTERS SOME RUDIMENTARY FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AROUND THE USE. AN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THE USE OF A BROWSER. WHICH MANY OF THESE WORKERS LACK EVEN THOSE FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS. SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS OF ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD HAVE AND TAILORING. THE INSTRUCTION TO THE TOOLS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. FOR HIGHER LEVEL INSTRUCTION WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE CONNECTED DIRECTLY. IN AND A ROBUST PLATFORM TO A FACULTY MEMBER. AND HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. BUT THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS THAT INDIVIDUAL COULD LEARN. AND COULD MASTER ON THE IPHONE SO. BUT THAT IS THE JOB OF OUR CONTENT EXPERTS ARE FACULTY. DEVELOP MODULES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE. FOR THE DEVICE THAT THEY WOULD BE. DEPLOY. THANK YOU. I CHáVEZ THIS WHO REALLY QUICK QUESTION TO THE LA OUT. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY STUDIES. AS FAR AS ONLINE LEARNING. OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING PEOPLE RIGHT HERE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR WERE NOT AS SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE DICE REFERRING SAN ONLINE. ISN'T BEST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I SEEN THOSE STUDIES SPECIAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE FOUR YEAR OLD ARE YOU ARE MANY SIZES SHOW. THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE ONLINE LET ME. I THINK THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF STUDIES THAT TRY TO MEASURE. PERFORMANCE IN THE CLASSROOM VERSUS ONLINE INCOME LOOK AT THOSE GAPS I THINK WITH VIRTUALLY ALL GROUPS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LOWER. PERFORMANCE. ONLINE THAN THAN IN PERSON THOUGH THAT GAP HAS BEEN CLOSING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND A BUT ONE OF THE IT'S ALL OF THAT IS THE CAT SO HOW BIG THAT GAP AND FOR DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ACTUALLY FOR OLDER. FOR OLDER ADULTS. THEY TENDED. YOU BETTER TO HAVE A LOWER DROP OFF IN PERFORMANCE AND FROM THAT WITH SOME OF THE STUDIES SHOW. I THINK THAT THERE WITH AN A IN THE THIRTIES I THOUGHT THAT WAS A SPECIFIC REASON. FOR OUR THAT THEY COULD BECKETT SPECIFICALLY TIE BUT ONE THOUGHT IS THAT OLDER ADULTS WHO CAMINO EXACTLY WHAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE DISCIPLINE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE. WHAT THEY'RE HERE TO DO AND SO THEY CAN BE MORE FOCUSED THAN I AM INTO COMBAT COURSE SO THERE IS? THUMB. CITY THE SHOW THAT I THINK IN IN IN GENERAL. OLDER ADULT THEMES HAVE THEM BETTER ON SOME OF THE LAWMAKERS I REFER TO THE ROUGH YOUR STUDY. BECAUSE IT SHOWS ADULTS DO BETTER ON ONLINE SO MAYBE FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT FOR THE GROUP THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOR THE STUDIES SHOW. THAT ARE ONLINE LEARNING CAN OFTEN BE ENHANCE FOR OLDER ADULTS. IN ADDITION WE THE ISSUE ABOUT A LEARNING DETAIL COMPLICATED THINGS. I LEARNED HOW DO WE. PLAN IN RELEASE. THE. NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ONLINE. AND THE DETAILS ON THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC IN ITS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA. NOT PASS SO. YOU CAN LEARN VERY COMPLEX THINGS IF YOU WANT TO. FOCUS ON AND GET IT SO. CLIP WE NOT HAVE A HIGHER EDUCATION IS AVAILABLE TO OUR LEADERS RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHAT. I FEEL A LOT OF THINGS THERE THANK YOU. AND NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF THE. PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. GREAT QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND CONCERNS FROM FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT BOTH HIGHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE BUDGET. CAN SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE ADDRESSING THIS I I HAVE A FEW THINGS ON THE WAY OUT THERE AND FRANKLY MOST OF THESE HAVE BEEN HIT. I I DO THINK YOU YOU OVER OVERALL TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT WE ALL. WE ALL CARE ABOUT IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. GET ADDITIONAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. THE FOCUS ON THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW BECAUSE THIS ECONOMY REWARDS PEOPLE WITH MORE EDUCATION BUT CONVERSELY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT PUNISHES THOSE. WITHOUT EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN I I AGREE THAT ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANDED. AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THAT THE YOUR YOUR MAP HERE AS KNOW SOME POPULATION BASES SAN DIEGO ALL A. RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO THE BAY AREA THEY HAVE A LOT OF COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES BUT ONE THING THAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEMS HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. IS WHETHER YOU'RE UKIAH READING SONORA. A BAKERSFIELD WE DO HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE TOO SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE STRANDED WITHOUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ONE FOURTEEN ONE. ONE FOURTEEN ACROSS THE STATE AND DAMN I THINK YOU KNOW WE RAISED A GOOD QUESTION IS WHY ISN'T IT WORKING FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE. STRANDED DON. TO GO IN AND GET MORE EDUCATION. OPTIM THAT MORE HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO TO ADVANCE. THEIR CAREERS AND SO FORTH. YOU KNOW CURRENTLY IN AN AND I DO THINK THAT YOU RAISE A QUESTION THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS FOR THE POOR FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND ONE THING THAT BEEN SAYING FOR FEARS IS. IS. THERE ARE DEPLORABLE IN MANY WAYS. SAY STRAIGHT UP. BUT WOULD THEY ARE BRILLIANT AT IS PROVIDING ACCESS SEAMLESSLY YEAH CAN ENROLL IN THE MALL. YOU CAN YOU CAN START ANY MONDAY. YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL SCHOOL ON FRIDAY NIGHTS WEEKENDS SUNDAYS. AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES PRETTY MUCH YOU HAVE TO START TWICE YEAR I GUESS YOU DO THE SUMMERS OF THREE TIMES A YEAR. YOU. UNIT UP THE COURSE OFFERINGS YOU KNOW THAT THE STEREOTYPE IS TRUE YOU GOTTA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FROM. FRIEND TEND TO FOR VERY CROWDED SOMETIMES EVENINGS BUT. THE THE EVENINGS IN THE NIGHTS THAT ARE PROBABLY VERY BUSY AT THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE PART. VERY QUIET THAT ON OUR. COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK WE'D DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC AND MATURE IF INSTANT ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY WHAT HAVE YOU BUT WE'RE NOT SERVING. THE STUDENT NEEDS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOME COMMUNICATIVE PROGRAM TO START. ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS ESPECIALLY WHEN A DEAL WITH THESE. STRANDED. ADULTS AS FAR AS HIGHER EDUCATION NEEDS OUT SO I GET THAT. I DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE YOUR OPINIONS BUT THAT THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT AS MYSTERY MAN SAID THAT THAT. THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AS FAR AS THE POPULATION WERE TRYING TO REACH. STORK TRANSIT BEING SUCCESSFUL THE SERVICES THEY NEED AN EVEN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE YEARS AGO WE WENT TO THAT. RIPPLE BUT THE CULTURE FELIZ P. YES THAT'S A RIGHT YEAH YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE IS GIVEN THE CLASS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SERVICE IS. COUNSELING UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAYES ARE GOING THROUGH AND SO. YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH YOUR SMARTPHONE YOU TO THE UNIVERSITY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA PLAY OUT WELL. FOR THESE FOLKS. YOU KNOW THEY THAT AS THIS THAT STAFF AGENDA AND ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT. THERE ARE A LOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE. IT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY BUT ALL HAVE OTHER AS A PHONE TO PHONE DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK I KNOW MY LITTLE KIDS THEY DO THERE MOBYMAX IN KHAN ACADEMY AND GOT EMAIL FROM OUR TEACHER YOU'RE DISSING. LA VICTORIA'S NOT NOT DOING HER. THINGS WENT TERRACE WHAT HAPPENS LIKE NO NO NO I SHOULD WE HAVE AN OLD IPHONE SHE TOOK IT FOR A FEW DAYS SHE WENT DINNER. THING BUT IT WASN'T CONNECTING PROPERLY DID DID AND SHE WASN'T ABLE TO PRESS THE SAME BUTTONS AS WE DO WITH THE COMPUTER INTERFACE AND SO. JUST SIMPLE. ON LOGISTICS. WHO LIKE THAT ON? BUT I DO HAVE TO QUESTION THE ONE I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO TO TO ANSWER THE. AND THAT. IT WON'T WORK WHERE WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. SOME YOU CAN BE CALLED DISTRICTS THAT ARE. ARE VERY CONCERNED SO. WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNS AND WHY ARE THEY POTENTIALLY WRONG? AND AND WHY DO THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL WILL HARM THEM PRISON BARS THEY'RE TEETERING DISTRICTS AS FAR AS AND ROMANTICS. DECLINING POPULATION BASE THEY SOME OF THEM FEW THAT. YOU I'VE HEARD THIS AT THIS COULD BE THE. DEATH KNELL SOME OF THEM. THAT THERE THEIR ENROLLMENT IN THERE JUST STAYING AFLOAT AND WHY ARE THEY WRONG. SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT. I I ABSOLUTELY RESPECT. THE OPINIONS AND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ANXIETY THIS CONCERN COMES FROM A PLACE OF. OF NOT BEING. SURE THAT. THE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY FUNDED WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATION. SO. IN MY MIND. AND CERTAINLY CONCERNS I'VE HEARD FROM THEM ARE THAT IF WE IMPLEMENT THIS NEW. PLATFORM THIS NEW ORGANIZATION THIS NEW COLLEGE. THAT THEY FEAR THAT IT WILL. ULTIMATELY. ROB THEM OF THEIR ROMANCE. SO. PROBLEM WITH THAT TO. CONCERN ISN'T DAMAGE INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSING A CONCERN THE PROBLEM IS. THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE CREATE. THAT RELY SO HEAVILY ON ENROLLMENT. INSTEAD OF RELYING AND PROVIDING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THE COLLEGES TO DO THE MISSION THAT THERE. I HAVE TO DO. SO I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THE CURRENT CONTEXT THAT WERE IN. AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO ONLY RELY ON ENROLLMENT FOR GROWTH IN REVENUES. THEN COLLEGES ARE EXPRESSING AND NATURAL ANXIETY. WHICH IS. WILL THIS NEW INSTITUTION TAKE STUDENTS AWAY FROM MY COLLEGE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANXIETY CENTERS ON WHETHER OR NOT. WE SHOULD. REACHES POPULATION I BELIEVE THEIR CONCERN COMES FROM THIS NOTION SO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WRONG I'M SAYING THAT WE AS A SYSTEM. OR CREATING THIS CONCERN THAT IT'S COMING FROM THE WRONG PLACE YEAH IRIS AS MISTER CHAVEZ SAYS CHANGE IS HARD. DELAYS THAT OLD SAYING THAT. ABOUT CHANGE IN A HALF THE PEOPLE. OUR. CAUTIOUSLY LIKE YOU. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SUCCESS AND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT CHANGE OUR ONE CERTAIN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN AS FAR AS THE. NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THOSE THESE THINK THINGS TOGETHER. AND YOU KNOW. MAKE MAKE THE ISSUE DAUNTING. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT. I'LL THAT YOU PROBABLY ANSWERED. AND THESE ARE. QUESTION SO BUT DOES IT MEAN THAT MIGHT GET AYE CONCERNS ARE ARE ARE THAT BUT I'LL I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO TO ADDRESS THIS IS. WHY CAN'T THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM? AND THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. WHY CAN'T THEY DO THIS WHY CAN'T WE EXPAND THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR THOSE ONLINE PROGRAMS? BECAUSE THEY THEY ALREADY HAVE. THE. THAT ACCREDITATION ISSUES WHERE THE FINANCIAL AID REVEALED TO GET THERE FROM THE GATE THE RD HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES. THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS IN THAT. THEN THAT. STUDENT POPULATION KNOWS ABOUT THAT THE HISTORY IN THE COMMUNION WHAT THIS PLACE IS THEY HAVE A BRAND NAME. AND THEN THEY COULD HAVE. HYBRID TYPE CLASSES WHERE YOU CAN GO IN PERSON ACTUALLY SEEING SOMEBODY AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT. DO MUCH BETTER THAN PURE ONLINE SO WHY CAN'T WE USE THE EXISTING. CAN BE CALLED SYSTEM AND AUGMENT THAT TO MAKEUP AND A STRONGER ONLINE PRESENCE. COURSE THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. IT'S A QUESTION BEING RAISED WITHIN OUR OUR SYSTEM. A FIRST OF ALL LET ME. TING YOU TO TRY TO BE CLEAR. WE'RE PROPOSING ITS A COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION MODEL A PERSONALIZED LEARNING PLATFORM. WHICH IS DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL. SEEK TIME FOR CREDIT. STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING WHETHER ONLINE OR IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR CLASSROOM. SO ONE. REALLY CREATING A VERY. COMPLETELY NEW DELIVERY MODEL IT'S PART OF WHY WE FEEL A NEW ONLINE. ORGANIZATION COLLEGE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT IS APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. A UP AND THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR FOR ONE OF OUR TRADITIONAL COLLEGES. AND THE SCALE AT WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE URGENCY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. TO ME. BUT WE FEEL. WOULD BE EASIER TO ACCOMPLISH IF WE DEDICATED A GROUP OF FACULTY. SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO DEVELOP THE CONTENT FOR THIS PLATFORM AND TO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF ADULTS OR. CERTAINLY THERE ARE COLLEGES AND I BELIEVE. IN IN THE SENATE HEARING ABOUT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE PRESIDENT BILL SCRUGGS DID A GREAT JOB OF EX. EXPLAINING HOW HE HAS IT'S COLLEGE OF THE PROGRAM. THAT DEALS WITH SOME OF THESE NEEDS. BUT THE NEEDS THAT. HE IS SERVING ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND CONFINED TO HIS DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SATISFY THOSE NEEDS AT SCALE. IF WE GO COLLEGE BY COLLEGE WITHIN REACH IN BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. THAT COLLEGE HAS TO PRODUCE ITS ENROLLMENT FOR ITS OWN BUDGET. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ELIMINATE SOME OF THAT COMPETITION. BUT ALSO. AGAIN. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TWO ASK A COLLEGE. QUICKLY ADOPT AND ADAPT A BRAND NEW. SCHEDULING MODEL OF BRAND NEW ACADEMIC CALENDAR A BRAND NEW WAY OF DELIVERING CONTENT. A IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT THIS ONLINE COLLEGE WILL PROVIDE THAT EXAMPLE THAT LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT EXPERIMENTATION THAT WILL THEN ALLOW ALL HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO MORE QUICKLY ADAPT? MODELS THAT MIRROR. WHAT'S BEING OFFERED AND ALLOW THEM TO BUILD THEIR OWN CAPACITY SO. THAT'S WHY. WE FEEL THAT ADDING ONE MORE MISSION. TO THE COLLEGES. DOESN'T ALLOW THEM. THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REACH. THE PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT. WE FEEL IS NECESSARY IN THE SCALE THAT WE THINK WE NEED. OKAY THANK YOU. OUT WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. PLEASE LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE. OKAY WAY WHILE WE'RE LIGHTING AT ANOTHER'S LA PEOPLE OUTSIDE AS WELL I BELIEVE WHEN A SPEAKS A PLEASE TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO. ONE MINUTES OR LESS. SIXTY SECONDS OR LET'S. THANK YOU. PLEASE BE A. HI I'M ROXANNE. I LIVED STUDENT OF THE CHANCELLOR WAS TALKING ABOUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. THIS REALLY COULD HELP A LOT OF STUDENTS. NOT ONLY. WHO WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ON LINE COLLEGE BUT? WHICH TRADITIONAL COLLEGE BUT WITH. MENTAL DISORDERS I MYSELF SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS A REALLY. REALLY BIG THING FOR ME. GOING TO COLLEGE. I HAD A BREAKDOWN. IN FRONT OF YOU THEIR COLLEGE AND I COULDN'T EVEN WALK THROUGH THE DOORS I SAT THERE FOR TWO. HOURS BAWLING MY EYES OUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME TO. DO IT. BECAUSE I HAVE A FEAR OF GROUPS AND PEOPLE LAW AND MY ANXIETY GETS THROUGH THE ROOF SO THIS. COULD REALLY HELP. EVERYBODY AS WELL AS FINANCES BECAUSE I AM OF AS A FULL TIME JOB. SO WITH THAT IT'S HARD TO. GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND IT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING. HAVING TO GO TO COLLEGE HAVING TO GO TO WORK HAVING TO FOCUS ON MY MENTAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE'S HEALTH AROUND. IT'S REALLY AT THAT. COULD DO A LOT AND IT COULD HELP A LOT OF OTHERS WHO ALSO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I DEAL. AT SO THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME OUT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THOMAS GREEN AYE SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND AND SIMILAR TO MOST OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN OUR SYSTEM A OUR SEE HIS HISTORICALLY APPROACHED ONLINE EDUCATION AS A WAY TO SERVE OUR COLLEGE IN REGIONAL STUDENTS ARE LOOKING TO AUGMENT THEIR IN PERSON COURSES AND PROGRAMS. AND THE ONLINE COLLEGE REPRESENTS A VERY DIFFERENT MODEL SO HIS PROPOSED YOU HEARD MANY THINGS SO I'M ADVANCEMENT. ADVANCE CREDIT A CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING MEETING COMPLEX HE'S ONLINE FLEXIBLE SHORT TERM FORMAT THAT INTEGRATES WORK BASED LEARNING. THESE IN THE OTHER PROPOSED DESIGN AND DELIVERY ELEMENTS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE ARE CRITICAL TO FURTHERING OUR COLLECTIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS YET A RC AS WELL AS THE OTHER HUNDRED THIRTEEN COLLEGES. HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE AT SCALE TO DO EXISTING BARRIERS AND LAWS REGULATIONS AND OTHER SYSTEM AN INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS. SO THE STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE REMOVES MANY THESE CONSTRAINTS. EXCUSE ME AND IN DOING SO CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTOTYPE. THESE DESIGN AND DELIVERY ELEMENTS THAT CAN BE REFINED AND EXPANDED ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM AND IN DOING SO STRENGTHEN OUR ENTIRE ONLINE ECOSYSTEM. SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT REFERS OFFERING TO YOUR ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND TRANSFER PREPARATION. HOWEVER I FEEL AND. THAT THAT IN MY OPINION THAT THAT FLEXIBLE AFFORDABLE FULLY ONLINE OPTION FOR WORKING ADULTS TO OBTAIN SHORT TERM SUB ASSOCIATE DEGREE CREDENTIALS WILL NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS OF OTHER COLLEGES INCLUDING AIR SEA. IN FACT MAY COMPLEMENT THEM. AND IT WILL NOT COMPETE WITH OUR ONLINE AT INITIATIVE. IT'S PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND TRANSFER PREPARATION THANK YOU. I THINK I LIKE YOU. PATH MCCALLUM WITH THE LARGE DISTRICT COALITION I LIKED FIRST TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA. OF THE CALIFORNIA COMEY COLLEGES ARE THE LARGEST TIRES ADD SYSTEM IN THE WORLD LET'S THAT WAIT FOR THAT IS THAT NEXT GUY SO ON THE ONLINE ACCOUNT SO YOU TAKEN BUT I THINK YOU TAKEN BOTH. SO IN REGARDS TO THE ONLINE PROPOSAL. OUR CLIENTS AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE CHANCELLOR THAT WE NEED TO STEP UP ON COPS HE BASED EDUCATION AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BETTER APPROACH. THOSE KIND OF STUDENTS IN EDUCATION. THE BARRIERS IN PLACE ARE BOTH FUNDING AND STATUTORY. IF WE CAN FOR EXAMPLE IN FUNDING. SO PUT SOME TARGETED FUNDING FOR COMP SEE BASIS BEING SUGGESTED IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET. CHANGE SOME REGULATIONS PRESIDENT GREEN JUST TALKED ABOUT THEN I THINK YOU CAN SEE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. EITHER DIRECTLY IN THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES STEP UP AND DO THIS MORE. OR THROUGH THE ONLINE INITIATIVE AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THE. UNDER FIFTEEN COLLEGE SO THEY'RE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS. MIGHT CLIENTS ARE READY TO STEP UP AND GROW IN THIS AREA ONE CHANGE ON THIS THAT WOULD BE DRAMATIC IS HOW WE FUND ONLINE EDUCATION. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SIXTEEN PERCENT DROP IN COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHEN YOU GO ONLINE IF YOU HYBRID. THAT AND YOU HAD DIRECT TUTORS YOUR RESULTS GO UP. SO WHAT THE WAY WE FIND ONLINE IS ON UP OF PEOPLE COUNT THAT'S ABOUT AN EIGHT PERCENT DROP. IF WE COULD CHANGE THAT TO A CENSUS DATE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE THEY ADD THOSE TUTORS AND HYBRID EDUCATION. AND ONLINE EDUCATION. SO IT'S A BIG ISSUE. AND THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE READY TO STEP UP I WAS WITH THE I THINK YOU. I I'M GREGORY VAN ACKER I'M ACTUALLY HERE FOR SOMETHING ELSE ON HERE FOR CAL RTA. PERSONALLY ALSO HAPPEN TO SEE THIS HAPPEN TO SEE THIS COMMITTEE MEETING. AND SO I CAME IN AND. I'M NOW CURRENTLY I WAS UP FOR TWENTY YEARS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS I WAS A. COMPUTER INSTRUCTOR AT VALLEY I TAUGHT ACTUALLY AND HE'S TO TO DO THAT TAUGHT IT A. MICROSOFT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND I DID CERTIFICATIONS IN. HIGH SCHOOL. MIKE SUPPORT IN MICROSOFT EXCEL. AND I AM NOW AND AS A PART TIME STRUCTURE I'M TEACHING AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AND WHAT I SEE IN. WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR SECOND CITY COLLISION ACCIDENT CLASSES BECAUSE SOME THIS RIVER? IS THAT THE HYBRID MODEL REALLY WORKED WELL FOR MY OLDER STUDENTS IS THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THAN I HAD EVEN THE TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO DO AN ONLINE CLASS BUT THEY CHOSE TO BE IN CLASS MY CLASS WHICH WAS MORE OF A HYBRID CLASS PART OF THE INSTRUCTION WAS ONLINE. LOT OF IT WAS IN CLASS IN MY EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE OLDER STUDENTS. REALLY NEEDED AN INSTRUCTOR. AND MY EXPERIENCE IN THE CERTIFICATION CLASSES. WAS THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT I HAD SEVERELY NEEDED COACHING TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH A CERTIFICATION TESTS. AND I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW. CERTIFICATION TEST FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE COULD BE PASSED. BY PEOPLE JUST DOING ONLINE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN PARTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION CFA IS OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL AS WRITTEN. WE DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT CFA DOES NOT OPPONENT OPPOSE ONLINE EDUCATION AND THE MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE TAUGHT OR TEACHINGS OF SUCH COURSES AT THE CSU. WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD IT MUST FOLLOW AT LEAST FOUR PRINCIPLES USE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES THAT MEANS NOT IN CREATING A NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. TO NOT DUPLICATING CITY PROGRAMS OR CLASSES THREE NOT CONJURING ACT CONTRACTING OUT WORK INCLUDING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT COURSE DESIGN AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FOR PROTECTING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST PROTECT OUR STUDENTS FROM EXPLOITATION. BUY ONLINE. PROF BY ONLINE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES BUT WE MUST NOT ALLOW HOURS OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM BE TO BECOME MORE LIKE THEM OFFERING LOW QUALITY CLASSES AND CONTRACTING OUT WORK IN A QUESTIONABLE EFFORT TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS. HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IS NOT CHEAP A TAKING SOME ONLINE COURSES AS PART OF A BRICK AND MORTAR DEGREE PROGRAM IS ONE THING ENTIRE ONLINE. DEGREES IS ANOTHER. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE THAT THE. A PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD BE BETTER SPENT SUPPORTING ONLINE EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TODAY WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE GOVERNOR REALLY WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND ACCESS ONE THING YOU COULD DO IS FULLY FUND THE SEGMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT EACH QUALIFIED STUDENT HAS A SEAT AND IS NOT TURNED AWAY DUE TO FUNDING THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF SERIOUS CONCERNS BUT THAT THE MOST PROMINENT CONCERN IS. THE LACK OF CONSTITUTIONALITY IN THE SET UP OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD WE BELIEVE IT'S AN CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT. TO THE TENETS OF PROP NINETY EIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINABLE. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ONCE THAT THE COLLEGES ESTABLISH IT'S RUN BY A PRIVATE BOARD GRANTED THIS IS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS BUT IN CONTEXT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT IT'S NOT A LOCAL ELECT EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WHICH MEANS PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS CANNOT FLOW IN BE MANAGED. THROUGH THAT INSTITUTION AND THEREFORE IT'S AN CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT IN CANNOT BE RECTIFIED IN LESS THIS WERE TO ACTUALLY RUN THROUGH A LOCAL COMMUNICABLE AGE THAT'S DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS. DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER CONCERNS. IT THIS IS SOMEWHAT AKIN TO WHAT K. TWELVE HAS EXPERIENCE WITH. CHARTER SCHOOLS THERE WERE A NUMBER OF UNANTICIPATED IMPACTS THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD ON THE EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT WE THINK THAT THIS COULD OPEN UP A SERIES OF FUN INTENDED. IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNICABLE ITS SYSTEM AND WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ARE ANSWERED PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD. SUCH AS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THESE INSTITUTION COULD POTENTIALLY SERVE STUDENTS OTHER THAN THE TARGETED DEMOGRAPHIC HOW WOULD THIS IMPACT HE TWELVE DUAL ENROLLMENT STUDENTS HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. EQUITABLE STUDENT SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELONG TO THE TARGET TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC ADDITIONALLY SINCE THIS INSTITUTION WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET FEES THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENTIATED THEN THE FEES THAT THE LEGISLATURE STRUCTURING. HOW DO WE KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY IN THE LONG RUN THAT THE FEE STRUCTURE WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS? UTILIZING BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE COSTS OF EDUCATION THE LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT FEES ARE KEPT TO A MINIMUM. THIS WOULD DEVIATE FROM THAT SO WE WOULD ASK THOSE QUESTIONS BE ANSWERED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ERICA BECAME SOLANO COMMUNITY COLLEGE MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE I'M CTE FACULTY AND DISTANCE EDUCATION COORDINATOR. AYE FEES THIS TARGET POPULATION EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ONLINE THEY WANT THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE OFFER AS FACULTY IN THE CLASSROOM. I DO TEACH ONLINE AND HYBRID AS WELL I EXPERIENCED A SUCCESS RATES I UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS THEY WANT TO BE IN THE CLASS WITH THE SUPPORT OF BY PUTTING AND PRESIDENT THIS FALL WE ARE ROLLING OUT SOME INNOVATIVE SCHEDULING. THAT MEETS THE STUDENTS NEEDS NOT JUST FACULTY WE'RE TURNING AROUND AND WE WILL SEE SUCCESS DATA IN THE SPRING. NOT TEN YEARS OUT AFTER WEAVER RECEIVED ACCREDITATION SOLANO WAS RECEIVED FULL SEVEN YEAR TERM ACCREDITATION THAT IS NOT A CONCERN IT CAN BE DONE WITHIN THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JOHNSON LIGHTMAN A BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CATHARINE COMMUTER COLLEGE THE FIRST ONE I THINK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS ANALYSIS AND WE'VE DISTRIBUTED A LETTER OUTLINING OUR CONCERNS AND WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE LA SHOW. WE HAVE HEARD FROM FACULTY. IN ADDITION TO THE SPEAKER WHO JUST AS SPOKE. THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THE SAME CONCERNS AND IF ASKED THE QUESTION. THAT WITH THE O. E. AYE THE STRONG WORK FORCE AND EVEN OUR OPPORTUNITIES WITH CONTRACT EDUCATION. DON'T WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS TO GO TO MISLEAD MOUNDS QUESTION AS WELL. THE IDEA THAT WE START A PROGRAM WE SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA GROW WHEN LAST WE MEET CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS AND YET WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHERE THE POLITICAL. CONSIDERATIONS COME AND THEY OVERWHELM THAT AND THE PROGRAM GOES AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE THINKING NOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO COMPETE IN THE FUNDING STRUCTURE BUT THEIR EXISTING COLLEGES. CHANGES OVER TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSTITUENCIES THAT SAY THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM EXPANSION NOT WITHSTANDING WHATEVER ANALYSIS HASN'T BEEN DONE. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO ON IT MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST AS YOU WERE POINTING OUT YOUR IPHONE SAYING THAT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS. THAT WAS THE MOMENT I PULLED OUT MY IPAD AND AND NOTED THAT THE WIFE IN THIS ROOM IS NOT WORKING. AND IT'S I JUST SAID TO MYSELF WELL CAN YOU SPELL IRONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS LIKE TONY ON MY FACULTY OF CONSUMERS THROUGH THEIR COLLEGE. AND SO I HAVE BEEN TEACHING FOR FIVE YEARS AND I HAVE SEEN A STUDENTS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND AND ALSO HAVE ME THEN ALSO ON NINE. AND THE MOST COMPLAIN I HEAR IS FOR THAT ONLINE IS STUDENTS THAT'S HOMELESS TIMES LISA. TO GET CLINICS TO TRY ONLINE TO MAKE POSTERS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY THEY NEVER USE IT IN THE REAL LIFE. SO TO BE HONEST I FEEL LIKE THIS MUCH MONEY TURNED F THERE IS ANY OF THE SENT TO CHANGE ANY ONLINE COURSES NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE CURRENT ONLINE CLASSES NOT MAKING A WHOLE NEW COLLEGE. AND I BELIEVE JUST JUST THAT TO BE THE LEAST OF TOTAL MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS JEANETTE MULHEARN AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS IN WHICH WE DID SEND A POSITION STATEMENT AGAINST THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO JUST TO BRIEFLY LET YOU KNOW OUR POSITION IS THAT THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE WOULD NOT PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITY BUT WOULD INSTEAD COMPETE WITH A HUNDRED NINE EXISTED. VIBRANT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH THE STATE. EIGHTY FIVE OR MORE OF WHICH CURRENTLY OFFER VIABLE DISTANCE ONLINE ACCESS TO DEGREES CERTIFICATES IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AND WHICH ALREADY SERVE OUR DIVERSE POPULATION IN VERY CAREER TRAINING NEEDS FOR QUALITY TEACHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I CAN MORNING I LYRICAL EASIER WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ALL SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS THE LEADERSHIP THE TRUSTEE OF THE CHANCES THE PRESIDENT'S. ARE THOMAS GREEN IS THE PRESIDENT OF A ARE SEIZE THEM ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CEO WORKING GROUP LOOKING AT THIS ONLINE AND THEY HAVE SOME DESIGN PRINCIPLES ME FIRST OF ALL. THERE'S A DIVERSITY OF OPINION THROUGHOUT THEIR THE THE SYSTEM AS YOU AS YOU KNOW. BUT EVERYONE I THINK AGREES WITH THE IDEA OF STRENGTHENING OUR PUBLIC OPTION OR OPTIONS FOR ONLINE EDUCATION BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED A PRIVATIZATION SOME OF THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND WE. WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL DO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR SOME KIND OF A REDESIGN PUBLIC ONLINE AN ECOSYSTEM IN IN TOTO. AND ALSO. THERE IS UNANIMITY THAT WHATEVER IS FINALLY DECIDED THAT THIS WORKS WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE IN OTHER WORDS. THIS SHOULD BE IN AND NOT AND NOT IN OR. OUT THERE WAS A MENTION ABOUT REGULATIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCING CONCERNS THAT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE. THROUGHOUT WE ALSO HAD ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE IN IN WEST HILLS TALKING ABOUT CONNECTIVITY AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S A LARGER CONCERN. ON. THE THE. AREN'T DE UNIT IS A VERY EXCITING THING TO REALLY LOOK AND DO AN ANALYSIS OF HOW TO DESIGN ONLINE EDUCATION THAT COULD HELP AGAIN. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR AS A WHOLE AND IF THIS ENTITY CAN PRESENT PREVENT. OUR PRESENT DESIGN PRINCIPLES BETTER THAN PROTOTYPE AND THEN CAN BE UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM THAT'S A FANTASTIC. SO THERE'S SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA OF INNOVATIVE APPROACHES WE HAVE TO A WE HAVE TO OFFER A PUBLIC OPTION. SO. AB AND APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS. HELLO GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S PAUL VOTES MORE EACH HISTORY I'M HAS REPRESSOR IT. THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND. MOSTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION STRANDED WORKERS. ARE THERE ALSO MEMBERS OF COMMUNITIES SO THERE THERE'S THE IDEA OF A STATEWIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THEY REPRESENT THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF YOU ADDRESS THEM AS MEMBERS OF. COMMUNITY THE I'VE TAUGHT ONLINE ONE GROUND HYBRID CLASSES AND WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS OF THE WANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF FACE TO FACE ACCESS. WHETHER IT'S A HYBRID CLASS OR EVEN AN ONLINE CLASS SO WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IS ENCOURAGING MORE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ONLINE CLASSES ON THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. AND MORE FULL TIME TEACHERS OF CHANGING THE PART TIME FULL TIME RATIO AND ALSO MORE COUNSELORS. FOR DIRECT CONTACT THIS IS WHAT. I THINK LEADS TO MORE. MEASURE WILL. DEGREES OF SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED BY THE CURRENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ABOUT THIS PROCESS. LAST YEAR OBSCENE IF HE TOOK THE LEAD IN ASKING FOR SOME A PART TIME OFFICE HOURS MONEY WE WERE TOLD THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALL IT. WAS A FORTY. BUT THIS YEAR SOMEHOW WE WERE ABLE TO FIND HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. DOORS AT YOU UNPROVEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND SOMEWHAT UNNECESSARY PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE REALLY OUT IF YOU REALLY WANT AND AND AND HANDS STUDENT SUCCESS AND ACCESS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. FOR US TO IMPROVE. WE KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT. STUDENT SUCCESS AND ACTS AS WE WE TEACH THE STUDENTS. ARE WE WANT YOU TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THE CURRENT ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE IT'S OF EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE HAS. INVESTED IN. PLEASE CONSIDER ARE MOVING FORWARD ON SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. HI I'M JEFFREY MICHAEL'S I'M THE PRESIDENT OF TRIPLE SAY I THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE INDEPENDENCE AND I TEACH AT CONTRA COSTA COLLEGE. TEACHING THEM HYBRID ENGLISH CLASS THIS SEMESTER AND IF YOU'D ASKED ME A YEAR AGO YOU COULD LEARN ANYTHING ONLINE AT A LAUGHED. BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT MY STUDENTS CAN ACTUALLY WATCH ME TEACH ON A LITTLE VIDEO RIGHT ON THEIR BONES AND I THINK IT HAS SOME POTENTIAL I THINK SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES HAVE SOME POTENTIAL. I THINK WE CAN DO IT BETTER AND CHEAPER. BY WORKING THROUGH OUR EXISTING STRUCTURES BUT MOSTLY I JUST WANNA SAY THIS IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD WORK. WHEN WE IDENTIFY A PROBLEM OR A NEW GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT WE'RE NOT SERVING WE SAY HEY WE WANT TO SERVE THE STUDENTS. WHAT ARE THE IDEAS WE SHOULD BE SITTING DOWN WITH FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND COMING UP WITH A PROPOSAL AND REACHING CONSENSUS AND BRINGING IT TO YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT? YOU'VE HEARD FROM ALL THE FACULTY GROUPS THE SENATE DIDN'T COME UP BUT THEY HAVE A POSITION AGAINST THE ONLINE COLLEGE THE FACULTY ARE NOT ON BOARD WHY WOULD WE START A NEW COLLEGE. WHEN THE FACULTY IN OUR SYSTEM ARE NOT ON BOARD WITH THE PLAN THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. FOR WE START ALLOCATING NEW DOLLARS TO NEW IDEAS WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER AS A SYSTEM AND WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH THE BEST IDEAS POSSIBLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE DON'T WORK THAT WAY THANK YOU. I DID ARE COMING AND PRESENT A LOS RIOS CALLS FEDERATION TEACHERS ALSO SEE OF TEA AND FAT. I'M. AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF INNOVATION. THAT THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF IMPROVEMENT. BATTLING ARE OR ARE NOT AFRAID OF TRYING GETTING BETTER ACCESS FOR ALL THE STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF INNOVATION. WE'RE ALL FOR THAT WERE ALL FOR ONLINE EDUCATION BUT WE WANT TO DO IT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE THAT EDUCATES THE STUDENTS THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. A WE CAN DO THIS THAT WE CAN DO AND. WE CAN ACCESS TO STUDENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE COULD DETERMINE WHETHER STUDENTS ARE GOING TO. ENROLL IN THEM OR NOT WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE THE THE STUDENTS ARE DOING WELL ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. WITHOUT COMMITTING A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. THEY WE DO THIS WITHIN EXISTING PROGRAMS WITHIN EXISTING STRUCTURES AND WITH FACULTY INPUT EMPHATICALLY LEAD THE WAY. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ONLINE COLLEGE IS THAT DOES THAT IT WAS. PUT TOGETHER WITHOUT REAL FACULTY INPUT WITHOUT REAL FACULTY. VOICE. YEAH I KNOW GOVERNANCE NO TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM AND EXPECT TO GET BUY IN FROM EVERYBODY THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI AND MANY SILVA FROM SAITEK WERE NETWORK OF A.

TRUE ON ALL OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO PLEASE. DO NOT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS DAVE OKAY I TEACH MATHEMATICS AT YUBA COLLEGE IN HAYWARD AND IN MOST OF THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE SHOVEL LAS CASITAS FACULTY ASSOCIATION. WE ARE FIERCELY OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED FUNDING MODEL AND THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT ROBS FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL. AND WHERE PETER. AT YOUR BOW WE HAVE CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD TRANSFER RATES AND WE ALSO CERTAINLY SERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YET SOMEHOW ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MARKUPS. ARE DISTRICT WOULD BE SLATED TO TO BEEF TO FACE A FOURTEEN PERCENT FUNDING CUT. AND THAT IS ON TOP OF THE STAIRS AND PURRS INCREASES THAT WE HAD A INCREASED COSTS THAT WE HAVE TO UP TO PAY FOR. BECAUSE THE THAT IS WORSE THAN WE EVER FACED DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE RECESSION AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WOULD BE CUTTING BACK. O. WE ACTUALLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD ENROLLMENTS BUT WE WOULD BE CUTTING ACCESS OF WHO IS HARD TO AMEND WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE LIKE NURSING A DENTAL HYGIENE THAT WHICH WE OPERATE AT A BIG LOSS AS IT IS. OF IS A GOOD CHANCE WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT THOSE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DISCUSSING IT ARE ALSO WE SEE THAT THE FUNDING MODEL AS AN ASSAULT. ON OUR WORKING STUDENTS PART TIME STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE. THAT OF THE FOR THE PART TIME AN EVENING STUDENTS AYE UNDERPREPARED STUDENTS ESPECIALLY WE WOULD BE FORCED TO CUT ACCESS FOR THOSE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE BECAUSE AGAIN THE FUNDING CUT WOULD BE SO GREAT. THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MAINTAIN THAT ACCESS AND WHATEVER HAPPENED A LIFELONG LEARNING. BUT THE MASTER PLAN UNTIL THIS MODEL SEEMS LIKE IT COMPLETE ABROGATION OF THE OLD MASTER PLAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE DESIGNED TO DO SO IT'S IT'S A WELL ESPOSITO'S. ó WE DO SEE THE MODEL IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR WORKING STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI JEFFREY MICHAEL'S TRIPLE SEE I YOU KNOW LEARNING COMMUNITIES LIKE WEDNESDAY AND EXTRA SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE UPS OR SOME OF THE VERY BEST THINGS WE DO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE TO SUGGEST WE SHOULD ALLOCATE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FUNDING. BASED ON OUTCOMES MEASURES THIS IS A A REAL PROBLEM AND I HOPE YOU WILL REJECT IT I'M READING FROM A RECENT RESEARCH BOOK THE EXTENT RESEARCH LITERATURE HAS FOUND THE PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. BUT THERE ARE HUGE A SIZEABLE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE IMPACTS INCLUDING RESTRICTING INSTITUTIONAL COOPERATION LIMITING OUR MISSION UNDERMINING MORALE. UNDERMINING QUALITY STANDARDS THERE'S A LOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HERE AND. OF EVERYTHING EVERYBODY HAS LEARNED FROM PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING THE KEY IS TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE WE NEED TO WORK ON CAPACITY BUILDING AND THE BIGGEST WEAKNESS OF THE SYSTEM IS OUR OVER RELIANCE ON PART TIME FACULTY. UNTIL WE INVEST IN FULL TIME FACULTY AND MORE COUNSELORS. ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE AND WHERE I COME UP HERE EVERY YEAR AND MAKE THIS. THESE INITIATIVES ARE NOT GOING TO PRODUCE THE OUTCOMES WE WANT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE. START BY IMPROVING YOUR FULL TIME FACULTY RATIOS AND WE WILL HAVE MORE AND BETTER AT TRANSFERS INSECT I THINK IT. AND DON'T FEEL. I WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS SIX STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRANTS PART OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA FOR DISTRICTS AND EXPEDITE TO GREECE IN THREE YEARS OR LESS. INVENTOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT OR I'M THAT I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT AT IT THE LOCAL AREA SEE IF THEY HAVE TEA. AND WE'VE HAD A ONGOING PROBLEM FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH SOMETHING THAT THE NEW DEANS AND SOME THE NEW ADMINISTRATORS ARE CALLING PRODUCTIVITY. WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS CLASSES THAT HAVE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS ARE BEING CANCELED SO THAT THEY CAN JAM INTO ANOTHER SIMILAR CLASS AT A SIMILAR TIME? SO NOW YOU HAVE FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE STUDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS HAPPENING WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE PAGE OF STUDENT EQUITY IN STUDENT SUCCESS. WELL YOU KNOW I AS AN INSTRUCTOR YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY STUDENT NEEDS AND PROMOTES STUDENT SUCCESS IS DIMINISH IS WHEN YOU HAVE FIFTY FIVE STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY. SO WHAT I SEE HAPPENING WITH THIS IT. INCENTIVE TO EXPEDITE THE THREE YEARS IS MORE OF THIS PILE ON PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE THE CLASS SIZES DAM AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN THROUGH AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN. AND STUDENT SUCCESS IN STUDENT EQUITY NOW JUST BECOMES YOU KNOW MEANINGLESS. THANK YOU. PETER SEXY LIBRARIAN OF INTER COLLEGE BUT ALSO CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR A HEFTY LOCAL EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT FOR PRINTER COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. WINTER UP MORE PARKING LOTS ARE COLLEGES SEEMS LIKE LEGISLATURE LIKED ZIG AND ZAG COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT WENT DIRECTLY TO STUDENT SUCCESS IN EQUITY. AND NOW IT SEEMS TO BE PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING. AND EVERY COUPLE YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE THE DIRECTION CHANGES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO REALLY WORK ON OUR CORE MISSION WHICH. ABLE TO GET STUDENTS THROUGH OUR COLLEGES AND IF THEY WANT TO GET A DEGREE TO TRANSFERRED TO WORK ON THAT OR FOR CERTIFICATES TO WORK ON THAT. WHEN THINGS KEEP ON CHANGING ON A REGULAR BASIS WHAT DO YOU GUYS REALLY WANT US TO DO. SO I IMPLORE YOU TO NOT GO FORWARD WITH THE PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING WILL HAVE DELETERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AN ILL GO CONTRARY TO WHAT LEGISLATOR APPROVED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WITH TRIPLE SP AND WITH EQUITY FUNDING. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JACQUELINE YEAH YES I ACTON I WAS PART OF THE WHAT THE PROGRAM I USE LOS ANGELES COLLEGE NOW I AM ATTENDING UC BERKELEY I BELIEVE.
