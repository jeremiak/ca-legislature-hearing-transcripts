WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON S. B.. NINE ONE AS WE LEFT OFF ON FRIDAY WE HAD A SERIES OF POINTS THAT WERE LISTED. FOR THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW. THAT HIGHLIGHTED A DIFFERENT OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. OF WHAT THE CONFERENCE REPORT WOULD BE MADE UP OF OVER THE WEEKEND A STAFF SAID AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH THE REPORT TO GO THROUGH. AND PUT LANGUAGE AND TAXED AND SUBSTANCE BEHIND OF THE POINTS THAT WERE A HIGHLIGHTED -- THIS IS. GOING TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE. TONIGHT MAKING COMMENTS AS IT RELATES TO THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE MANY OF US ARE STILL MAKING OUR WAY THROUGH IT. HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS AND CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK NEED TO BE -- FURTHER ADDRESSED AND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE HAVE ALL OF THAT. WE'RE STILL TREATING THIS AS WORK IN PROGRESS -- AND SOME MEMBERS I THINK FOR THE MOST PART OR SEEN SOME OF THIS INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND SO I WANT TO FIRST -- JUST SAY THAT. IN MANY AREAS IN MANY RESPECTS THEY'RE STILL THERE AND SAY -- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DAYLIGHT BETWEEN WHAT. COULD ULTIMATELY MAKE ITS WAY AS A FINAL PRODUCT THAT COULD BE VOTED ON BY THIS COMMITTEE. OF THERE ARE STILL SOME ELEMENTS WITHERED BE IN THE FORCE MANAGEMENT [inaudible] OUR SECTION. WAR AND HOW WE DEAL WITH WAIT GREAT RECOVERY THAT STILL HAS ELEMENTS THAT. NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AND ADDRESSED CLEARLY WE UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZE THE TIME FRAME AND SO WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN NOW. AND SOMETIME TOMORROW A WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE A FINAL POSITION ON DOCUMENT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE. INPUT FROM I KNOW MANY OF YOU. ARE NOW LOOKING AT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME -- BUT WE WILL ALSO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY NIGHT. FOR FOR USE THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ON ELEMENTS OF IT IS THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU FEEL THE NEED TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS. WITH A SONG SO AS YOU CONTINUE. TO REVIEW IT A WILL TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- HERE SHORTLY. BUT WE WILL TO FIRST HOW TURN TO SENATOR DODD. TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS AS IT RELATES. TO OF THE THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN FRONT OF GET THE A PROPOSAL THAT IN FRONT OF US TODAY IS A NOT THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATOR GENERALLY. I SEE GENERALLY -- IN AGREEMENT WITH ITS -- HIGH BRAND OF WHAT WE HAD COME UP WITH IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS -- INSERTED THEIR CHANGES ON IT -- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WORK WORK WORTHY OF DISCUSSION OR WE WOULD NOT BE HERE I DO WHAT IT LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT ARE. LISTENING AND THAT THIS IS NOW UP ON THE WEBSITE. SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK -- AND FOLLOW ALONG -- YEAH THAT'S GREAT -- I I THINK IT YOU KNOW IT IT IN A NUTSHELL. WHERE WERE AT IS WERE AT A SITUATION WHERE -- WE STILL HAVE THE SAME GOALS THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT WE MET. ANYTHING THAT WE DO. SURE PROTECT VICTIMS TODAY. AND SHOULD ALSO HARD THE GRID SO THAT VICTIMS THERE ARE NO VICTIMS TOMORROW AND BEYOND. IT SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE PROTECT RATEPAYERS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND WITH ALL THE FIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN -- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO FAR WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE -- FORREST THAT ART HELP THE THAT HAVE TONS OF FUEL ON IT. AND THAT TYPE OF A PROGRAM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE FINAL PRODUCT AND THEN FINALLY FROM MY VANTAGE POINT -- HAVING HEALTHY UTILITIES -- FINANCIALLY HELP RATEPAYERS AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PREMISE THAT WE'RE GONNA ALL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH IN. AND GET OUR ARMS AROUND I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- YET. I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT OTHERWISE RATE PAYERS PAY MORE IN THE ABOUT. OF CREDIT DOWNGRADES BANKRUPTCY OR ANY OF THOSE -- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATE EVENTS THANK. SO LET ME IF I COULD IF. I CAN TURN TO ANY OF THE MEMBERS AYE WHO LET ME JUST SAY TOO THAT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THIS -- THERE IS A AND ATTEMPT TO TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. YOU SEE AND THE PURPOSES OF THE PIERCING HAVE COME BEFORE US AND ASK. FOR CLEARLY AND DIRECTION ON HOW WE WOULD HAVE STRUCK THEM -- TO ADDRESS AND RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THEM CERTAINLY. THE NEW INITIAL -- APPLICATION THERE WAS RESPONDED TO FROM SD GENIE IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES AND HOW IF THIS. LEGISLATURE IS SO INCLINED TO GIVE DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THAN WHAT THEY WERE OPERATING ON THE STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. AND THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO IS TO GIVE SOME. A CLARITY AND SOME DIRECTION OF THAT WOULD. GIVE ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO THE P. YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE. FUTURE APPLICATIONS. IN A WAY THAT COULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. A CERTAIN CHANGES THAT ARE EXISTING AND THE A CLIMATE. WHETHER IT BE WIND HUMIDITY OTHER FACTORS THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT CONSIDERED SO ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO ALLOW. OF THE P. YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE APPLICATIONS GOING FORWARD. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS THAT ADDRESS. OF THE FUEL AS THE MY CO CHAIRS POINTED OUT THAT IS EXISTING IN THE FORCE THAT. WE HAVE LOOKED -- TO OUR COLLEAGUES THE DOCTOR WOULD AND MISTER DALI TO HELP GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF IMPORTING. IMPORTANT -- ELEMENTS THAT WE THINK COULD NEED TO BE REFLECTED IN THIS A DOCUMENT. A BECAUSE CLEARLY. WE SEE THE STATE BURNING. OF FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR AND NOT. HAVING ANY CONNECTION. OF THEIR WE'RE AWARE OF TO UTILITIES. THE CAUSE. AND SO THERE'S AN ISSUE OUT THERE PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE NEED TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND IT AND I THINK THIS REPORT. ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT ANOTHER IMPORTANT A PART OF IT IS THAT. OF SECURITY FOR THE WORK FORCE WORKER PROTECTION. THERE IS AN ELEMENT IN THIS REPORT THAT ADDRESSES WORKER PROTECTION. BECAUSE UNDER THE WILL WORST CASE SCENARIO [inaudible] AND THERE IS A BANKRUPTCY OR SOME KIND OF A SITUATION THAT CAUSES -- UTILITIES OUR WORKERS TO BE PUT IN JEOPARDY WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THAT. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS. AND THERE DETAILS CERTAINLY THERE IN THIS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW. OUR BUT WITH THAT IF THERE ARE COMMENTS FROM ME ANY OF OUR MEMBERS [inaudible] SENATE HUESO. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU. TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER SOME LANGUAGE. AND I HOPE THE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO IT SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REVIEW THIS AND GET BACK TO US AND TALK ABOUT. HOW THIS AFFECTS? EACH AND EVERY INTEREST OUT THERE IN OUR STATE. THIS IS OUR OUR PROCESS INVOLVES PUBLIC INPUT. IT REQUIRES A A RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE PUBLIC. WE NEED TO HEAR. FROM THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AND AT LEAST WE WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT ARE DECISIONS [inaudible] OUR OUR ARE LEVERAGED AGAINST. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN AS AS CHAIRMAN OF ENERGY ALL THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM. ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE TALKING ABOUT. THERE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPEN TO STRAIGHTEN SYSTEM WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO IMPROVE HEALTH CALIFORNIA'S. RESILIENCY RELIABILITY. AND I HEARD ALL OF THOSE FOR FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS MOMENT. OF OUR ABILITY. TO DELIVER SOMETHING TO THE PUBLIC THAT WILL ADDRESS. THE MOST PRESSING MATTERS FACING US TODAY. AND I I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH EXAMPLES OUT THERE [inaudible] IN. OUR GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE ARE WRESTLING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. AND DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF ONE INCIDENT. AND WHAT HAS IT HAS DONT DONE TO THEIR COMMUNITY I CAN NAME. SEVERAL BUT IN PARTICULATE I JUST WANT TO RAISE THE EXAMPLE OF PUERTO RICO -- UP AKON A THE COMMONWEALTH WERE. YOU SHOULD BE A STATE. GONNA GET INTO A CONVERSATION BUT NO WE'RE NOT. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THOUGH THEY WORK THEY WERE DEVASTATED BY THE HURRICANE THAT TOOK OUT THEIR GRID. FOR ALMOST A YEAR. AND THE IMPACT THAT HAD TO THAT COMMUNITY. TO THE EXTENT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD LITTLE FULLY [inaudible] THEIR HOME. AND NEVER COME BACK. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION AND ECONOMY. THAT IS -- A PLACE OF ENORMOUS PROSPERITY. FOR A VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF AMERICA. THIS BECOMES ALL THE MORE REAL TO ME. NO I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES. THE CONCERNS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I I WOULDN'T CALL THEM. FRIVOLOUS OR OVERESTIMATED. OR OVER EXAGGERATED. BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE EXAMPLES ACROSS THE WORLD TO GET. TO WHAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE HERE IN AT SOME TO SOME DEGREE WERE ALREADY SEEN. SO. I HOPE THAT. IN OF IN OUR DELIBERATION THAT WE WE GET THIS RIGHT. AND IF THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF THIS. THAT WE ONLY WORK ON THOSE PARTS THAT WERE VERY CERTAIN OF BECAUSE A LOT IS AT STAKE HERE [inaudible] AND I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT AND ALL THE MEMBERS. THERE ARE COMMITTEE TO THIS EFFORT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS. THAT IMPORTANT AND I DON'T WANT TO DISMISS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD. THAT WE SHOULD NOT ACT TODAY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT THAT IMPORTANT WE SHOULD WAIT. NO. WE SHOULD NOT MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL PUT OUR STATE IN JEOPARDY BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE NEED TO ACT. ON THEM MOST PRESSING MATTERS AFFECTING -- THIS ISSUE TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WILL RESOLVE THIS BY THIS WEEK AND I JUST. WANT TO THANK THAT OPPORTUNITY SHARE [inaudible] PICKCENTER [inaudible] SIR STONE. THANK YOU UP DIDN'T MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SOME OF US -- RECEIVED A COPY OF THE THE DRAFT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MINUTES AGO AND WELL I NEVER TOOK IN EVELYN WOODS -- READING CLASS -- WE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SCAN THE SAME PRETTY FAST AND I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS. I THINK THAT ARE OUR PRIORITY SHOULD BE. SAFEGUARDING OUR COMMUNITIES SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT -- AND PROTECTING THE REPAIRS. AND AS A RAT IN THE DOCUMENT I SEE SOME SICK SOME SOME ISSUES OF OF HARDENING -- THE LINES AND A THIRD PARTY VERIFIER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE UTILITIES ARE APPROPRIATELY HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO THE SATISFACTION OF A THIRD PARTY -- GROUP -- AT THE WAY I I READ IT I DON'T KNOW IF I READ IT CORRECTLY THAT THAT WILL BE A COSTS IS BORN TO THE RATEPAYERS -- I'M CONCERNED THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASES -- NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTIONS OF THIS 䥡MITTEE AND WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT A BASIC PREMISE. TO THE P. YOU SEE AND AUTHORIZING -- PROFIT CENTER BY FOR PROFIT -- UTILITIES THAT IT SHOULD BE AN INCUMBENT RESPONSIBILITY ON THE UTILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. OPERATING SAFELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE LAWS AND STATE POLICIES AND AND AND AND SUBJECT TO THIRD PARTY VERIFICATIONS -- ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET IN THERE AND DO SENATE -- I APPRECIATE THE THE LANGUAGE OF SAYS THAT WE CAN GO ON TO FEDERAL -- FORESTS THAT -- ARE. ALREADY SUBJECT TO NIPAH WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE DUPLICATIVE SEQUEL PROCESS. I'M NOT STE I'M STILL NOT CLEAR YET MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN. TELL ME ABOUT HOW WE GOING TO STATE PROPERTIES AND IF THERE'S ANY STREAMLINING THE ALLOW US TO FAN -- BRUSH AND A HUNDRED TWENTY DEAD OR DYING. I APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN USE SOME OF THE LOGS FOR LUMBER RATHER THAN JUST -- BURNING THEM UP -- ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT -- WE ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWING FOR SOME. SOME STREAMLINING AND OTHER MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT I SEE A FIVE YEAR -- WINDOW -- AFTER WHICH I THINK THINGS GO BACK TO THE WAY THAT THEY WERE WITCHES. CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN. EMBRACE A DOCUMENT WITH A FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND ACCOMPLISH ALL THE GOALS THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO MAKE THE STATE'S SAFER I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT LEAST A TEN YEAR WINDOW. OF OF EXPEDITION -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT -- THE P. YOU SEE -- IS GOING. TO THE MANDATE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL FIRE TO SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PREACHING ABOUT. HELLFIRE CERTAINLY HAS THE THE EXPERTISE AND ENSURING THAT -- WIRES ARE PROPERLY -- MEDICAID AS FAR AS RUSSIAN AND TREES AROUND THEM -- THEY NEED THEY NEED TO BE TALKING MORE WHEN YOU WE LEARNED WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY AUDITOR'S THAT -- WERE WORKING FOR THE PC TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE OF HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MILES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THERE. ARE ARE SAFE -- FOR OUR COMMUNITIES -- ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW FOR GOING TO GET TO SOME OF THESE MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEAD TREES AT THERE'S A PROVISION IN HERE THAT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF RECRUITS IT YOU CAN HAVE A SIX HUNDRED FOOT. ROAD TO GET EQUIPMENT IN THERE TO CLEAR THE TREES. HE OTHERS ANOTHER REQUIREMENT IN HERE THAT. THE SIX HUNDRED FOOT ROADS LITERALLY CANNOT BE -- CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET DEEP -- INTO SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE INUNDATED WITH A LOT OF THOSE DEAD TREES AND BRUSH INAPPROPRIATELY CLEAR THEM -- TO LEASE CREATE FIREBREAKS TO ASSURE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE -- A RESURGENCE IF YOU WILL OF THIS CONTINUATION OF THIS FIRE SEASON THAT TECHNICALLY SHOULD NOT EVEN BE BEGUN YET. SO WE WE MAY JUST BE BIG THAT AT THE BEGINNING. OF OF HER EVEN MORE HORRIFIC OF FIRE SEASON THAT WE'VE -- WE'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR -- I THINK THAT THE SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF ME BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND HEARING YOUR ALL YOUR POINTS OF VIEW -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE SUCH A QUICK AT DEADLINE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING. IN PRINT AND SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON PRIOR. TO EMBRACING -- THE THE BILL -- I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH TIME TO GET IT DONE WE'RE JUST GONNA% HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD IN THE NEXT -- TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO DO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH. OUR SEVENTY TWO HOUR IMPRINT RULE WITH OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE SESSION COMING TO AN END HERE. THIS FRIDAY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK. A. M. SO I LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIRMAN WHO I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF THEM FOR WORKING AS HARD. AS THEY HAVE IN TRYING TO GET US TO THIS POINT THIS IS NOT A EASY. ISSUE IT'S COMPLICATED HAS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND THAT EVERYBODY HAS VALUABLE INPUT -- EVENT THAT I RESPECT AND I'M HOPING THAT. BY TOMORROW THAT WE CAN ALL RELEASE A MAJORITY OF US AGREE THAT -- WE'RE PUTTING THE CITIZEN SAFETY FIRST WERE. WE'RE GOING TO APPROPRIATE THINNING AND HARDENING OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PROTECTING OUR REPAIRS -- IS AS BEST AS WE CAN WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. MAYBE PUSHING SOME UTILITIES TO THE BRINK. BUT NOT PUTTING THEM -- INTO A PLACE WHERE THERE BANKRUPT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SERVING THE RAPE IT ALSO -- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE COMMENTS FROM THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE. THEY CENTER SO SIR CANNELLA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO WE HAVE TWENTY SIX HOURS AND FIFTY FOUR MINUTES TO HAVE A BILL THAT WE CAN VOTE ON BY THE INTO SESSION. SO THE SENATE HAS COME TO AN AGREEMENT SO WE WANT TO REACH YOU AGREE WITH ARE EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT I HOPE WE COME TO AGREEMENT AND TWENTY SIX HOURS FIFTY FOUR MINUTES. OTHERWISE ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE IS WASTED SO I LOOK FOR TONIGHT I HOPE WE CAN REACH AN AGREEMENT. WE LOOK FORWARD. TO MEETING US ON OUR SIDE -- STYLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IN. ALL OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE WHO OF WEATHERED THIS SOME PROCESS I SO I'M A FARMER AND NOT AN ATTORNEY I HIRE ATTORNEYS WHEN I NEED THEM TO DO CONTRACTS FOR ME SO I DON'T IT IN TROUBLE SO I WANT. TO SPECIFY THAT AND ON THE GATE SO [inaudible] WE'VE SPENT. MANY MANY HOURS THE LAST TWO SUNDAYS -- ARE SIDE OF THE HOUSES THAN THE HOUSE WE'VE BEEN WE WORKED. FROM SEVEN O'CLOCK TILL TEN THIRTY LAST NIGHT. THE SUNDAY BEFORE IN THE CHAIRMAN ASSURED ME THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING NEXT SUNDAY'S WHICH WAS VERY. ENLIGHTENING TO ME SO I WANT TO TRY TO PUT THIS IN TERMS -- THEN MAYBE YOU CAN ALL HELP ME WITH HOW WE GET LANGUAGE. THE PLACE BECAUSE AS I STATED OUR FIRST HEARING THAT. THE PEOPLE ARE DYING. MY CONSTITUENTS YOUR CONSTITUENTS. WE TRULY HAVE HAD A CATASTROPHIC EVENT HAPPENING CALIFORNIA. WE ARE OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOMES BURNED LAST YEAR. THREE WEEKS AGO ELEVEN HUNDRED HOMES BURNED IN MY DISTRICT. WE HAVE A A MASSIVE. FUEL LOADING PROBLEM SO. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT MISTER WOULD. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FOR YEARS NOW. AND WE RAN BILLS. AND WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSE AND THEY'VE BEEN TWEAKED AT THE END TO WHERE THEY DON'T WORK ON THE GROUND. BUT IT FEELS GOOD THAT YOU SAID YOU PASSED A BILL BUT WHEN YOU GO TO IMPLEMENT IT ON THE ACTUAL FOR GROUND. IT DOESN'T WORK. SO I READ THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE PAGES LAST NIGHT TO SOME OF THE LANGUAGES BEEN CROSSED. AND I WAS SURE YOU. THAT IT WILL NOT WORK ON THE GROUND. AND THERE ARE THINGS IN THERE LIKE. ARCHAEOLOGY ARCHEOLOGY STUDIES AND YES WE ARGUE ALL THE STUDIES ON WHAT WE'RE DOING TIMBER HARVEST PRODUCTION OFF OF TWO OFF OF TIMBER PRODUCTION ZONES BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY CLEARED A THREE HUNDRED FOOT. DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THEIR HOME. BUT ONLY THAT'S NECESSARY. I THINK WE NEED TO GET. TO THE POINT WHERE. WE HAVE REAL [inaudible] STREAMLINED. OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSTITUENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED USE NOW. THE DOLLYWOOD BILL OR DOLLYWOOD LANGUAGE. HAS BEEN IN PRINT FOR WEEKS. AND WE'VE SHARED THAT NO ONE A SHARE TODAY WE HAD SOME SERIOUS MOVEMENT -- MY STAFF HAS MET WITH THE STAFF OF THE SENATE AND WITH ASSEMBLY AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN SOME CHANGES COME FORTH. BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT COUPLE WEEKS AGO DREW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAID. I'M NOT MOVING UNLESS WE DO SOME SERIOUS FUEL VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OUT THERE. NOW WITH THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE. THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. HE ASKED FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FOUR YEARS. AND WHAT WHEN YOU GO TO PUT THAT LANGUAGE THERE'S BLUE POLLS HAVE HOW YOU CAN NOT GET THAT LANGUAGE DONE AND THERE'S LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND I GET THAT. BUT TO DO STREAMLINING AND NOT PUTTING MONEY WITH IT IS DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BURNING UP OUT THERE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINED WE WANNA PUT SOME SERIOUS RESOURCES IN THEIR BECAUSE WE ARE MEETING MORE CARBON AND WE ARE BURNING PEOPLE UP AND WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT AT THE PATIENTS GO WE NEED TO DO IT AT IF WE DON'T. PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE ON ON FORCE MANAGEMENT. AND NOT JUST FORCE MAYBE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. STREAMLINING PROCESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THOSE WHO LIVE. IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S AN ACTUAL TREE THAT HOUSE OF VALUE IT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA NEED THE MONEY AS MUCH AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES. IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S BRUSH. AND THAT A LOT OF THIS STATE THEY'RE GONNA NEED. THE RESOURCES TO GO AHEAD AND MANAGE A BRUSH BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST PUT FIRE IN IT IT AND THAT YOU'RE GONNA MANAGER WITH WITH THE MATCH. SO I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THE SECOND PART I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT. WE'VE HAD BECAUSE WE WERE IN THIS HEARING BECAUSE OF FIRE NUMBER. ONE AND THE NUMBER TWO THING WERE AND YEARS BECAUSE ONE OUT OF TEN FIRES [inaudible] ARE STE INDICTED BY [inaudible] UTILITIES. AND WE HAVE A HUGE A LIABILITY IN THE WAY WE'RE STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE IF YOU'RE LIABLE. IN ANY POOR THAT IN ANY PORTION OF THAT. YOU'RE THE YOU'RE YOU PAY IF YOUR UTILITY THAT CAUSED SOME FIRE YOU PAY AND THAT GETS PUSHED OFF. TO UTILITY AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE US THE GENIE CASE WHERE THEY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND THERE'S THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OWED AND THE P. YOU SEE SAID. YOU'RE GONNA PAY IT AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. I'M OKAY WITHOUT THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT. WAS IN PLACE. BUT NOW THAT WE'VE HAD THESE EXTREME CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE HAVE UTILITY OTHER P. GINNY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THESE FIRES BECAUSE UNDER THAT RULING. THEY WILL BE THEY WILL BE HELD A WITH THAT BEING SAID. HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD AND HOW DO WE SAY? TO ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT. THE INVESTORS NEED TO PAY. BECAUSE I BELIEVE. INVESTORS NEED TO HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME AND SO. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PUT THIS IN LANGUAGE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I THINK. WOULD BE A PROCESS THAT WOULD. ALLOW US TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND IT WOULD HELD HARMLESS. ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE HELD HARMLESS I THINK WE SHOULD. FOR THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN FIRES [inaudible] WE SHOULD. TELL THE UTILITY. TO PAY THE THE INVESTORS TO PAY AS MUCH ADD TO A POT OF MONEY. THAT THEY CAN IF THEY CAN AFFORD WITHOUT GOING BANKRUPT. SO LET'S JUST PICK A NUMBER. LETS SAY THAT THEY DID A STRESS TEST ON THEIR E. ON THERE AND THE THEY CAN PAY. THREE BILLION DOLLARS ALL THIS ON PICKING A NUMBER OF HOPE IT'S SIX AND WE PUT OUT A POT AND WE SAY TO THEM. NOBODY GOES INTO A POT AND IT AND IT STAYS IN THAT POT AND WE DON'T CHANGE ANY OF THE RULES FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO FOR TWO THOUSAND HEAVY FOR YOUR JUST LIKE AS THE GENIE. YOU'RE LIABLE YOU PAY YOU PAY UP FRONT SO YOU'VE TAKEN DOWN WHERE THEY'RE NOT BANKRUPT YOU TAKEN ALL THE RESOURCES. AND YOU PUT IN THAT PART. SO THAT TAKES CARE OF THEM NOT BEING BAKER EARLY THAT WOULD PREVENT BANKRUPTCY BUT WE'RE PUTTING THAT TO THE SIDE THEN MOVING FORWARD FROM. TWO THOUSAND FROM JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FORWARD IF WE PASSED SOME. FORWARD WE WOULD SAY. WE WOULD GIVE SOME DIRECTION TO THE P. YOU SEE. WHO TELL THE PEACE P. YOU SEE? WE'RE GONNA DO WHILE WE'RE GONNA FIRST OF ALL WE WOULD DO THE FUEL MANAGEMENT WE PUT MONEY WITH THAT THAT SOMEONE NUMBER. TWO WE WOULD TELL THE PC LOOK. WE'RE HARD UP THE LINES WE'RE GOING TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND IF. YOU ARE AT FAULT. MR UTILITY WHOEVER YOU ARE OUT THERE FROM JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FORWARD. IF YOU ARE LIABLE. AND YOU AND LENDS LESS YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN. MISTER WOODS DISTRICT WERE A TREE BLEW LAMB BLUE FROM OUTSIDE THEIR CLEAR ZONE THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND IT BLEW INTO THEIR TREE. AND BECAUSE THE FIRE. SO THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT WE'VE TOLD THEM TO HARDEN UP THEIR SYSTEM. BUT IT IT HIT THE LINES OF THE LINE BECAUSE THE FIRE SO WE WOULD SAY THAN WE WOULD GIVE SOME PARAMETERS TO PC FOR THE P. C. TO BE ABLE TO SAY. WELL THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. THEY'VE TRIED TO PROTECT THEIR RATE PAYERS THEY DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR INNATE IN THEIR POWER BUT YOU KNOW NOT TO GOD LET THIS LINE THERE. SO THERE 10% LIABLE THEIR 50% LIABLE THERE IF THERE ARE SOME. A FORMULA THAT COMES UP WITH SAYS THEY'RE LIABLE AND FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT THEY'RE LIABLE FOR THEY PAY. AND WHATEVER AMOUNT THEY'RE NOT LIABLE FOR IT HAS TO BE PASSED ON THE RATEPAYERS. AND THAT'S HOW WE WOULD GIVE THEM SECURITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND ALLOW THEM TO RECOUP. THAT'S IN MY MIND A PROCESS. HOW YOU PUT IT INTO WORDS I HAVE A LOT OF WORDS I WANT TO PUT INTO THE FORCE MEASURE EXACTLY UNDERSTAND THAT? BUT THE OTHER PIECES I NEED SOME HELP WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU [inaudible] JEFF. WELL THANK YOU -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING AT THIS LATE STAGE HOME LITERALLY LAID IT'S NINE FIFTEEN IN THE EVENING -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK ON THIS AND I KNOW WE WE DO THIS OFTEN BUT I I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE ANITA. BUG GIVE A LOT OF PRAISE TO OUR CO CHAIRS DON'T BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM HAVE DONE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF WORK ON THIS. OTHER STYLES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT YOU GUYS CAN LAUGH IT'S OKAY -- BUT THERE IT WE'VE ACTUALLY I THINK GOT TO A PLACE WHERE SOME REALLY GOOD WORK I'M HAS HAS BEEN DONE. I'LL LAST NIGHT SO. WE ENDED UP HAVING A MEETING AMONGST THE ASSEMBLY -- CONFEREES AND WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A SOME LANGUAGE LAST NIGHT AND WE HAD LOTS OF ROBUST CONVERSATION. A LAST NIGHT THEM ALTHOUGH AFTER SEVERAL HOURS AND DRIVING ALL DAY COMING UP I GOT A LITTLE -- MAYBE A LITTLE DELIRIOUS. AND SO I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND WANTED TO PUT SOME THINGS -- TO PAPER AND I KNOW THAT -- THAT OF SOME OF THEM WERE DALLY LEADER DALLY -- HAD JUST TALKED ABOUT A FEW OF THESE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S IMPORTANT IS FOR US TO TO NOT JUST. SPEAK ABOUT ALSO BUT THE TO LISTEN AND TO KIND OF GET A SENSE OF WHERE. WHERE EVERYBODY NOW IS THAT? I'M LAST NIGHT I DIDN'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF LISTENING AND A LOT OF TALKING BUT AFTER ON THIS MORNING A GOING OVER THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US LAST NIGHT. AND THERE WERE IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE LAST LAST EVENING ACTUALLY THINK THE LANGUAGE. THAT WAS IN OUR IN NINETY EIGHT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD AND I'M LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE I'M TALKING TO IT ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE LIABILITY -- ON VEGAS NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT PAGE THIRTY FIVE PAGE THIRTY SIX AND AND ALSO. WHAT'S IN THE DOOR AND ON A NINETY SIX WE JUST RECEIVED THAT THIS EVENING THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD. I LANGUAGE IN THAT REGARD REGARDS TO CREATING A REASON WEST REASONABLE A STANDARD. I WONDER THOUGH -- AND WE TALKED ABOUT A THAT REASONABLE STANDARD BUT IF WE DO IF IT'S THAT THERE'S AN APPETITE AMONGST -- THAT THIS -- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE WHAT HAPPENED -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY ANA ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS. AND SO THIS MORNING I'M AYE ALONG WITH THEM SOME STAFF WERE TALKING AT THE IN PUTTING SOME THINGS AT THE PAPER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME A FOUR POINT PLAN AND THEN LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THAT BECOMING THE MAYES PLANET PREFER NOT TO BE CALLED THE MAYES PLEDGES TO HIS TO REALLY. BUT WHICH WAS. IF YOU KNOW THE FIRST PART OF THAT WOULD BE AND I THINK YOU GOT A COPY IN FRONT OF YOU. BUT WOULD BE THAT THE DOLLYWOOD REGULATION AT CHANGES IN REGARDS TO OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT AND FIRE PREVENTION OF THE SECOND PART OF IT WOULD BE -- MAKING SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY FUND THAT -- THAT FED FORCE MANAGEMENT AND IN FIRE PREVENTION AND IN THE THIRD ONE WOULD BE DEALING WITH OUR PAST INCIDENTS WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT TO BE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE NEED TO SECURE TIES WITH A STRESS TEST. AND MAKING SURE THAT SHAREHOLDERS NAM BEAR THE BRUNT BECAUSE THERE IS SOME LIABILITY THAT'S THERE BEFORE RATE PAYERS WOULD PROVIDE I'M ANY COVER UP FOR THEM AND UNDER THAT OLD RULE WE WOULD USE THE EXISTING PRUDENT MANAGE MANAGER STANDARD I'M EXISTING UPROOTED MANAGER STANDARD. AT ON THE FOURTH AND FINAL THING IS IN REGARDS TO FUTURE INCIDENTS AND THAT WOULD BE A DEALING WITH A COST RECOVERY. A MAKING SURE THAT FAULT THIS IS PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FAULT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE ON THE HOOK IF. A THERE WAS A ANY LIABILITY THAT WAS CAUSED BY -- THE THAT THAT THE COMPANIES. A BUT IF THOSE THINGS THEY WANTED FAULT. THAT THAT WOULD THAT COULD BE PASSED ALONG A TO TO RATEPAYERS AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY ANY STOMACH AT ALL AMONGST THIS. OF THIS COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE THINGS AND MAYBE MAKE SOME CHANGES I'VE ACTUALLY THIS EVENING PEOPLE ARE PASSING ME -- LANGUAGE THIS EVENING AS I WAS WALKING IN AND THINKING HEY THAT'S A PRETTY DECENT PLAN THAT MAY THERE'S THERE'S A FEW LITTLE TWEAKS THAT THAT COULD BE ADDED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO REWRITE THE WHOLE ARE IN WHICH IF YOU LITTLE TWEAKS THAT COULD BE MADE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE SO I JUST WANTED TO OFFER THAT. THANK YOU MISS REYES THAT WOULD. OR THINK OF IT THANK SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND OFFERED THE TIME THEY'VE INVESTED AND AND ACTUALLY QUITE FRANKLY FOR PUTTING UP WITH SOME OF US -- THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO. YOU KNOW WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THESE DISCUSSIONS -- I WAS TROUBLED [inaudible] BECAUSE WHILE WE HAVE WE HAVE UTILITIES WE HAVE -- WE HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAD -- ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING VICTIMS WE HAVE OUR OUR OUR WORKERS WHO WORK WITH UTILITIES. THE ISSUE THAT WAS A REALLY BEING DISCUSSED MUCH WAS VICTIMS DIRECTLY I MEAN THEY WERE THEY WERE BEING DISCUSSED BUT THEY CERTAINLY WERE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. AND THAT FRUSTRATED ME. THANK ONCE -- THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION FROM THE DISCUSSION -- WE SAW THAT IT THERE SEEM TO BE A PATHWAY FOR THE VICTIMS AND THAT THAT PLEASED ME AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ISSUES THAT REPRESENT MY BOTTOM LINE OR AS I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE PRESS -- MY LINE IN THE SAND -- I THINK IT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE REGULATORY CHANGES TO FACILITATE FIRE PREVENTION. AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND THE LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSAL IS CLOSE IN MANY WAYS. AND I THINK WE CAN GET THERE. BUT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND SOMETIMES A SINGLE WORD OR TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE CURRENTLY IN. MY DISTRICT OR PARTS OF MY DISTRICT THERE'S A FIRE BURNING. A CALL THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX AND TODAY. THE LATEST REPORTS ARE THAT IT IS AT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES. NOW THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LARGER THAN THE LAST PREVIOUS LARGE FIRE WHICH WAS THE THOMAS FIRE AND AND SENATOR JACKSON'S DISTRICT. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES HAVE BURNED IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLIES DISTRICT DESTROYING A THOUSAND OVER A THOUSAND HOMES AND THAT FIRE IS STILL BURNING AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FOR COMPLETELY CONTAINED. IT'S VERY CLOSE. CLEARLY WE HAVE AN ISSUE. OVER A MILLION ACRES IS BURNT ARE READY THIS YEAR AND WE HAVEN'T HIT SEPTEMBER FIRST. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HE AND I FOR QUITE AWHILE. AND I WILL NEVER FORGET MY VERY FIRST YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY LISTENING TO BRIAN ON THE VERY LAST NIGHT OF SESSION. SAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT FIRE I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT FIRE. I CAN REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID. BUT I DO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT DAY. AND A MAJOR WILDFIRE BROKE OUT LAKE COUNTY. AND THAT'S WAS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN HERE. THAT HAD THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED SIGNIFICANT ONGOING FUNDING FOR PREVENTION AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. A CURRENTLY THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEFORE US. PROVIDES FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. NOT BEEN ASKING FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I DIDN'T PULL THAT NUMBER OUT OF THE AIR. THAT NUMBER CAME [inaudible] FROM. ESSENTIALLY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S REPORT IN APRIL ASKING FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE LIGHT. AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED AS WELL. I'M LOOKING FOR LANGUAGE. AND I KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS ARE. THE GUARANTEE THIS FUNDING. AND I'D. I'D DIE DON'T THINK I CAN SETTLE FOR LESS THAN THAT. I WANT TO GUARANTEE WE DESERVE THE GUARANTEE CALIFORNIA. DESERVES A GUARANTEE TO THAT WE'RE GOOD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT PROPERTY AND MAKE PEOPLE SAFE IN THE STATE. PART OF THIS WE SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERING HOW ENSURE THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS. HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE ASSETS. TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM. AND MAKE THEIR JOB SAFER AS WELL. NOT BEEN ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE LOOK AT THAT THE THE PAST FIRES AND YOU NO I BEEN I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. CHANGING THE RULES FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US TALKS ABOUT A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO -- TO BE CONSIDER FOR THE PC TO POTENTIALLY CONSIDER. HOW THE LIABILITY MIGHT BE PARCELED OUT IN THE FUTURE? BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THAT DECISION. WORK DONE. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THEIR WORK DONE. AND I THINK I THINK I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT A LOT OF A HARDENING. THEY WERE ASKING FOR SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST. I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SOME SORT OF A TEST. THEY MAKE SURE THAT SHAREHOLDERS PAY FIRST. THAT RATE PAYER INCREASES THAT ARE NEEDED AFTER THAT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY -- WITH WITH THE UTILITIES. AND WE SHOULD FIND A WAY THAT WE SECURE TIES THAT WAR OR SPREAD OUT SO THAT THE PAIN IS SMALL. OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD AND I'D LOVE TO KNOW AT SOME POINT THE NUMBERS ON THAT WITH HOW THAT WORKS OUT. BUT PART OF THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE. THAT WE PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THOSE ANY RATE INCREASES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT GOING FORWARD. I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PROCESS LAID OUT IN THIS IN THIS DOCUMENT THAT LOOK THAT THAT CONSIDERS OTHER ISSUES GOING FORWARD LIKE. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE NGUYEN LIKE HUMIDITY LIKE ALL THOSE THINGS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AFTER. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE GRID HARDENING WE NEED. AND THAT GRID HARDENING SHOULDN'T. WAIT UNTIL WE GO THROUGH A P. YOU SEE RATE MAKING PROCESS THAT SHOULD START RIGHT AWAY. AND NOT ONLY SHOULD START RIGHT AWAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT'S BEING COLLECTED FROM RATEPAYERS TO DO THAT IS ACTUALLY SPENT A PROPERTY. AND WE OUGHT AUDIT MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS. AND YOU KNOW HOW WE GET TO THE REST OF THIS YOU KNOW THROUGH IN THE NEXT [inaudible] TWENTY HOW MUCH TIME SENATOR CANNELLA. YEAH WHATEVER. YEAH THIS IS LESS TIME THEM FORCES THAT WE SAID BEFORE -- IN THIS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IS -- IS IS IS IS THE CHALLENGE AND SO. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT I WON HERE WITH THE REST MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY AND WELL LOOK FOR TO FURTHER DISCUSSION [inaudible] SENATE MARIA'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WANT TO THANK OUR TWO CHAIRS. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT THEM. AND AS SOON Y. COLLEAGUES SAID THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH THE REST OF THEM. IT OF THAT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES MENTIONED THAT HE DROVE UP FOR SEVEN HOURS WE'VE SPENT TWO SUNDAYS HERE. YESTERDAY WE DID RECEIVE. THE LANGUAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE ABSTRACT. I THEN WENT HOME AND FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS. READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE. AND MADE SOME NOTES FOR MYSELF. IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK BUT IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT WORK AND ITS BEEN COMMENTED ON THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE COME HERE. THE COMMITTEE HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS DISCUSSING AND DELIBERATING. THE ISSUES WITHIN ITS PURVIEW. THE TOPICS OF LEAD TO A CRITICAL QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE. WHAT IN THIS SITUATION IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE? IS OUR ROLE MOVING FORWARD SAVE. FOR A BAILOUT A BUSINESSWOMAN HAVE ARGUABLY MISMANAGED THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. FOR ME THE ANSWER IS NO. I'VE ALSO HEARD A DESIRE BY SOME TO ADDRESS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. FRANKLY AS NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE. THE REPORTS ON THESE FIRES HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED. TODAY WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF FAULT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. NOR THE TOTAL COST AFTER SETTLEMENTS PAYOUTS. TO BE CLEAR. WE MUST HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. WE WILL NOT ENGAGE IN A BAILOUT. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT THOUGH IS OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SECURITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND THIS HAS BEEN JEOPARDIZED BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATION CAUSED. BY THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. SOME OF THE STATISTICS AND I THINK. WE NEED TO REMEMBER THESE WE NEED TO IT WHAT WE NEED TO PUT THIS ALL INTO PERSPECTIVE. OR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONE OF THE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT THE COST HAS BEEN OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THERE'VE BEEN A TOTAL OF OVER NINE THOUSAND FIRES. FIVE THOUSAND HOMES BURNED. FORTY ONE DEATHS [inaudible] CIVILIAN DEATHS. PLUS TWO FIREFIGHTERS LOST THEIR LIVES. NON FATAL INJURIES INCLUDE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE CIVILIANS AND TWELVE FIREFIGHTERS. THERE'S MUCH THAT WE NEED TO DO. BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I WANT TO DEAL WITH IS MAKING SURE THAT ARE VICTIMS ARE MADE WHOLE. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION [inaudible] THE FUTURE [inaudible] HARDENING. AND I LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES REALLY AT I REALLY AM RELYING ON MY COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S IT WOULD AND DOLLY. TO GIVE US MORE DETAILS ON THAT. WE DO HAVE A FARMER IN OUR MIDST. AND WE DO HAVE TO TAKE. HIS LEAD ON SOME OF THESE THINGS. STEP STAFF DRAFT. THAT MANY OF YOUR HOPEFULLY ALL OF YOU [inaudible] SEEN. IT'S NOT A COMPLETE OR PERFECT DOCUMENT. pMUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. WE MUST PRIORITIZE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT NOW. WE MUST ADDRESS AND CLARIFY THE RULES OF ASSESSING CASES OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR WORKERS WHO RISK BEING DISPLACED DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. I WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE POLICY LANDSCAPE. IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE NO SINGLE ACTION WILL PERMANENTLY FIX THIS PROBLEM. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE'RE HERE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE ACTIONS ULTIMATELY TAKEN BY THIS COMMITTEE. MUST REFLECT THAT COMMITMENT. I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THIS AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALL HAVE WORKED VERY HARD THIS IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE HONOR WORKING WITH EVERYBODY BECAUSE THE COMMITMENT. A GENUINE COMMITMENT FROM ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS CLEAR. WE KNOW WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING WE KNOW WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME STATE STABILITY. I THINK GETTING THERE I THINK WHAT WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME DISAGREEMENTS ON EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON ALL THE DETAILS AS IT HAS BEEN SAID. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY IT READY TO WORK FOR THE NEXT TWENTY SIX HOURS. SO THAT WE'RE SURE TO GET SOMETHING TO PRINT. AND BE ABLE TO VOTE ON IT ON FRIDAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SIR JACKSON. WELL SINCE I STARTED THIS OFF YESTERDAY I GUESS HOLES. FINISH IT OFF AT LEAST THIS FIRST ROUND TODAY -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY. A I ACTUALLY YESTERDAY SAT DOWN AND READ TO HIM. HE GOT WRENCHING FOUR PAGE LETTER. FROM A WOMAN IN MY DISTRICT -- WHO LOST HER HUSBAND AND HER SON? IN THE DEBRIS FLOW AND TERM HER SON'S SOME BODY IS YET TO BE FOUND. AND THE FACT THAT BOTH SHE AND HER SURVIVING DAUGHTER. ALONG WITH THE HUSBAND IN THE SUN WERE BLOWN OUT OF THEIR HOME LITERALLY IS THE HILLSIDE ABOVE MACHITO HOME CAME DOWN -- THEY LOST THEIR DOGS WELL. AND THE TRAUMA I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU SAW BUT THERE WERE PHOTOS AND A SCENARIO OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT THEY I RECOVERED. AYE IN THAT TO BRIEF LOW WHO JUST ABOUT DROWNED BUT MIRACULOUSLY FOUND A POCKET OF AIR. AND THAT WAS HER DAUGHTER. AND SHE HERSELF WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR THREE WEEKS -- AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THE SCARS ARE SO DEEP. THAT SHE'S HAD TO QUIT HER HER JOB. BECAUSE FOR DAUGHTER IS SO TRAUMATIZED THAT SHE LITERALLY CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE. IT'S OUR SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE WE CANNOT FORGET THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOSE THEIR LOVED ONES AND I WON'T EVEN GO INTO WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY THIS WAS -- SO I LOOK AT THIS FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE I KNOW WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT IT -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF KEEPING ELECTRICITY GOING KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON KEEPING PEOPLE WORKING IN. AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY -- IMPORTANTLY REFERENCED HERE BUT THIS IS REALLY ARE IN MANY RESPECTS ABOUT THE SAFETY IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE FIRES HAVE BEEN BURNING WILL CONTINUE TO BURN ALL OVER THE STATE IN THE RURAL AREAS IN THE URBAN AREAS [inaudible] FROM FROM BEVERLY HILLS TO TAMANA SETO INVENTOR AND TO THE SANTA ROSA AND LAKE COUNTY IN AYE EVERYWHERE DOWN TO SAN DIEGO SO. WE DO HAVE A AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK WE DON'T KNOW A A PRETTY GOOD JOB ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH SOME OF THE APPROACHES. TO TO GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE TREASON AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON BUT I THINK THAT TOGETHER WE CAN COME TO SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE NOBODY IS GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY THIS IS NOT A HAPPY SITUATION. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING EXCITED AND CELEBRATING WITH GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING. THE PEOPLE OF OUR OF OUR COMMUNITY SO -- I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE -- THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE BUT I THINK THE ISSUE THE ONE MAJOR ISSUE OUT STANDING IN AND I AGREE WITH THIS AS I DON'T WANT TO REWARD OR LET. THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING LESS THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING YOU KNOW OUR UTILITIES THEIR PRIVATELY OWNED DOG I GRANT YOU THAT BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A MISSION. THEY ALSO RESPONSIBILITY TO PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THEIR MONOPOLY WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT ABILITY AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY HAVEN'T NECESSARILY TAKE IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. A CAREFULLY AND ARE HONESTLY. ON THE OTHER HAND WE NEED THOSE COMPANIES ARE WE NEED SOME FORM OF COMPANY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE STATE. AND TO OUR EXISTENCE AT THIS POINT TIME AS WE BEGIN HELL ARE SO DEPENDENT UPON IT. SO IT SEEMS TO ME ONE OF THE ISSUES IS. HOW DO WE? ARE SURE THAT THAT ELECTRICITY CAN. TO AT THE SAME TIME ASSURING THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE THAT BEFORE THE MISSION OF BOTH PROVIDING THAT ELECTRICITY AND SECURING. A THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO LIMIT TO THE EXTENT HUMANLY POSSIBLE THESE EVENTS WHERE I HAVE TO READ ABOUT MY CONSTITUENTS WHO. LOST THEIR LIVES MY MY M. GRANDDAUGHTER -- WAS IN CLASS WITH THIS YOUNG MAN AND THEY HAVE LEFT HIS SEAT VACANT. I IN HIS MEMORY -- FOR THE LAST YEAR -- WE ARE A STATE OF PEOPLE. AND SO I THINK OUR FIRST PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO OUR PEOPLE. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT ARE THE COSTS AND THE LIABILITIES. FOR A IN THAT BET PARTICULARLY PGN IN I WOULD POSIT THAT EDISON WILL HAVE LIABILITY IN MY DISTRICT FOR THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED [inaudible] SO. WE HAVE TO ASK THE COURT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO. TO TAKE WHAT WE CAN FROM THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE PROFITED BY THEIR PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOR. BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE HUGE PROFITS IT -- ARE SHOULD SAVE -- GIVE BONUSES TO THEIR CEO'S -- FOR THE PROFITS THEY HAVE INCURRED A IN RECEIVED AT THE AT THE EXPENSE OF CLEARING OUT THERE AREAS IN DOING THINGS THAT WOULD HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE -- YET AT THE SAME TIME OUGHT NOT IMPACTING THE REPAIRS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN AVOID THAT. AND YET WHAT I'M HEARING IN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE AND I WANNA SEE THE NUMBERS. WE HERE FROM PEACHY NEITHER THREATS OF GOING BANKRUPT ARE HAVING THEIR THAT CREDIT RATING REDUCE THAT MAY BE TRUE -- I WANT TO SEE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE I'M CONVINCED THAT PEACHY ISN'T THAT. THE A PRECIPICE OF BANKRUPTCY THEY'VE MADE WHAT WAS A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS OVER THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR THEY CONTINUE TO DO WELL AND THAT'S JUST FINE [inaudible] BUT THOSE PROFITS HAVE TO COME BACK. AND WE NEED TO AYE I GUESS SO THE SENATOR DODD REFERS TO IT AS A SCRUB MEANING TAKE THOSE PROFITS. AND WE NEED TO USE THOSE PROFITS TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE MISGUIDED. PROFIT DRIVEN MOTIVES THAT HAVE CAUSED. AND MANY OF US. TO TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE THE TRAGEDY IN OUR DISTRICT AND AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DOING THAT. THE PROFITS HAVE TO COME BACK. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL. IS IT SUFFICIENT. AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE GET INTO THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF SECURITIZATION. AND IF YOU SECURITIZED WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT IT'S THE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT PAYER. AND I ASK WELL WHO ELSE. COULD WE LOOK TO FOR THIS. AND I AND I'M NOT SURE DETERGENT ANSWER [inaudible] SOME. YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO GET THAT MONEY BACK FROM THE CEOS AND OTHERS WHO CAVALIERLY FELT THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO ALL THESE BONUSES. FOR ESSENTIALLY -- MAKING ALL THIS MONEY AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH. SO I THINK -- WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE P. YOU SEE. THEY HAVE A ROLE HERE WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT THEY TO HAVE A RULE -- I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO WHAT THEIR SUPPOSED TO DO. AND AND LOOK AT THE VARIOUS FACTORS AND I FOR ONE AM NOT PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT CHANGING THE RULES NOW RETROACTIVELY. I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO APPLY THE SAME STANDARD SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN APPLYING PERHAPS GOING FORWARD WE CAN HELP GIVE THEM GUIDANCE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE GOT TO DO THEIR JOB THEY GOTTA STEP UP. AND I THINK ARE WE NEED TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE MARKETS -- THAT WE ARE SERIOUS. ABOUT HOLDING THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED ELECTRICITY. AND I THINK WE NEED -- TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT NOT AS AN EXCUSE AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE SOME OF US HAVE A CONCERN. WE'VE ALL KNOWN CLIMATE CHANGE WAS HAPPENING. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HAD IMPACTS IT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE BUT A MOTIVATION [inaudible] A MOTIVATION. IT HAS TO BE FACTORED IN BY THESE UTILITIES. THE CANCER ALL WELL CLIMATE CHANGES HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM SO THEREFORE YOU KNOW DON'T HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE. NO YOU HAVE TO FACTOR CLIMATE CHANGE INTO THE WORK YOU'RE DOING YOU HAVE TO HARDEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'VE GOTTA BE OUT THERE TAKING A LOOK AT THE LIMBS OF TREES. THAT COULD BLOW IT IN EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HAVING WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A PASS FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT MANY OF US. ARE FEELING THE FRUSTRATION IN THE HUNDREDS OF LETTERS THAT MANY OF US I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN GETTING A FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VICTIMS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE [inaudible] OUR RATEPAYERS SHOULDN'T TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY THE BIGGEST HIT FOR THIS THE SHAREHOLDERS THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND SO. FOR ME I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND I THINK WE CAN GET THERE WHEN IT COMES TO THE IT COULD ENVIRONMENTAL ECOLOGICALLY SOUND APPROACH WE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT I THINK WE CAN COMPROMISE AT IN INCOME OUT WAS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH. THIS IS THE ISSUE IS THE SECURITIZATION ISSUE THIS IS THE ISSUE WITH THE P. YOU SEE. AND I FOR ONE DON'T WANT TO GIVE A PASS TO THESE COMPANIES RETROACTIVELY I DON'T GIVE A PASSED TO THEM GOING FORWARD BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP SOME GUIDELINES. AND THAT IS THE FRAMEWORK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US ALL OVER THE NEXT. I PROBABLY TALKED FOR A FULL HOUR SO THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE HOURS THAT ARE LEFT SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD -- BUT HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE WHO NEED TO BE PROTECT THE VICTIMS THE RATEPAYERS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. AND SO I HOPE THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS WE CAN SUSPEND. THAT'S SORT OF ARE INTRACTABILITY WE SOMETIMES FEEL BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT HERE IF NOT A WE HAVE FAILED THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR. WAS OF ANY OTHER. SENATOR DODD AND THEN -- DISTRO. YOU KNOW FOR THE VERY BEGINNING. YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT. CURED IS ASIAN -- IN IT YOU KNOW IN THE OUR DISCUSSIONS ON THE SENATE SIDE WE FELT LIKE. YOU KNOW A SCRIBE. I TO CAST [inaudible] INDEPENDENT AUDIT -- OF P. GENIE WOULD BE NECESSARY TO TAKE THE MAXIMUM OUT THAT THEY COULD ABSORB [inaudible] BEFORE [inaudible] I YOU KNOW. ABSOLUTE DOWNGRADES -- THAT WOULD REALLY IMPACT THEIR RATE PAYERS BEFORE -- SITUATION LIKE BANKRUPTCY. AND I TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO FIND SOMEBODY SOME INDEPENDENT. VOICE FINANCIALLY IN THE MARKETS TO OPINE ON WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT'S NOT. BECAUSE THIS THIS DISCUSSION HERE TODAY I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MONEY MANAGERS. THERE WE'RE BOTH LONG AND SHORT I. P. JEANNIE. AND OF COURSE THE ONES THAT ARE SHORT ON P. JEANNIE [inaudible] WHAT THIS? TRY TO TALK THAT WE HAVE HERE ABOUT BAILOUTS. IT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT THEY WANT THE STOCK TO CONTINUE BECAUSE THEY WANT LATER THIS WEEK THEY HAVE A DOWNGRADE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THEIR GIMME PROFITING BY ANY DOWNGRADE OF PGA ON THE OTHER SIDE THOSE THAT ARE LONG ON PGP THAT A BAD RPG NAY. ACTUALLY THERE BOTH SAYING THE SAME THING THEY AGREE WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEY AGREE THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE IN A BET. SO THE CONVERSATION UP HERE. HAS TO BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THAT YOU BET DOESN'T HAPPEN. IT I AM JUST SO FUHRMAN THAT AFTER TALKING TO THESE -- HAD THE THESE PEOPLE IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF P. JEANNIE GOES BANKRUPT. LET ME TELL YOU. ALL THOSE FAMILIES FORTIES FORTY SIX PEOPLE THAT DIED. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. THE FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND HOUSES AND BUSINESSES. THAT DEAD BIRD OF THE GROUT. WE KEPT THE INVERSE COMBINATION IN PLAY AND I'M TOTALLY OKAY WITH THAT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THE VICTIMS ARE GONNA GET BRUTALIZE COULD BE VICTIMIZED AGAIN IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO. THAT WE DO WHAT I SAID AT THE AT THE UP AT THE TOP OF MY COMMENTS. ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS AND NOT TO REPEAT THEM BUT THE LAST ONE WAS MAKE SURE THAT WE ASK FISCALLY SOLVENT. UTILITIES IT'S ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT. IN MOVING FORWARD. BUT YOU KNOW. I JUST WANNA GIVE A COUPLE THINGS LIKE MICHAEL PICKER SAT HERE IN FRONT OF US AND SAID I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE WE'VE AUDITED P. GENIES BOOKS. IT I DON'T EVEN LIKE BE IN A POSITION WHERE I DEFEND THE PGD PARTICULARLY. SINCE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THEY DID MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES. WHEN HE OPINED? THAT THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY DID THE HARDENING. THAT THEY WERE PAID TO DO THAT'S WE TOLD US RIGHT THERE. SO I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSE WHAT I HEAR SOME OF THESE THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE PROJECTED IT FOR THOSE OF YOU DIDN'T GET THEY THE PRESS DEMOCRAT THEY'RE OUT OF SANTA ROSA. THEY HANDLE THE YOU KNOW THE THE NEWS AND IN THE STOMACH COUNTY AREA ALL GROUND ZERO FOR FOR THE FIRES -- YEAH. I THINK THAT AREA PROBABLY AS A RESENTMENT RATE. PGP HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY A ROUTE BUT THIS NEWSPAPER SAYS THE PLAN. THAT ESSENTIALLY IS BEFORE US TODAY IS NOT A RATE PAYER BAIL OUT [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. IT'S NOT A UTILITY BAIL OUT IT'S A RATE PAYER AND VICTIMS BAIL OUT. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THE JOB HERE AND PROTECT. IN MAKE THEM PAY AS MUCH AS THEY COULD POSSIBLY PAY THAT IT'S GOT TO BE. THAT THE CONVICTION THAT WE HAVE THEY'VE GOT A THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE THE FIRST DOLLAR AND SKIN IN THE GAME. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT PLAN. WE LOSE ALL THAT AND AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ARE VICTIMS. IT OUR RATEPAYERS ARE GONNA JUST PAY MORE AND MORE. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I CAN ASK JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION OF MORE INFORMATION HERE. WE HAVE THIS DOCUMENT. TODAY WAS FIRST DAY. WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT. AND AS I'VE REVIEWED IT IT HAS. QUITE A BIT OF VERY TECHNICAL -- LANGUAGE. AND IT IS -- THIRTY OR SO PAGE DOCUMENT. ON WHAT IS A PROCESS I MEAN TONIGHT ARE WE GONNA. IS CONTINUE ON WITH OUR JUST GENERAL COMMENTS AT WHAT POINT. ARE WE GONNA COME BACK OR I MEAN I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'D HAVE PROBABLY. HAVEN'T SEEN AT WAR HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW WHAT. I ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE ON THIS DOCUMENT. I THINK GENERALLY WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED GENERALLY ISN'T HERE. I CAN SAY THAT. WITH SOME CERTAINTY BUT THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS. AND AND I MEAN THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND WE HAVE A WEEK. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO THOROUGHLY DISCUSS ANY ITEM THAT MAY. RAISE A CONCERN OR NOT BE VETTED THOROUGHLY. WHAT IS THE PROCESS WHAT WE? WHERE WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE TONIGHT? I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH -- INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US TO GET INTO THE DIRTY DETAILS HERE FROM HERE [inaudible] SO. WHAT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP HERE WE GONNA COME BACK TOMORROW AND WE CAN -- TAKES HER TESTIMONY AT SOME POINT THERE ARE NO IF YOU CAN SOROKA. HELLO ATTEMPT. TO THIS DOCUMENT. FIRST OF ALL IT IT'S A PRODUCT THAT -- HAS HAD SOME EVOLUTION FROM WHEN WE HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT -- YESTERDAY EVENING AND WE SPENT ABOUT THREE HOURS AS A AS OUR ASSEMBLY CONFEREES KIND OF GOING THROUGH IT AND HAVING A CHANCE TO GET. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COMFORT I THINK THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE WERE -- SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF WHAT. THE NEXT STEP MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF OUR REACTION TO IT. ARE I DO THINK -- CLEARLY. WHAT WE HEARD FROM [inaudible] BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY AND ALSO FROM SELLING AMAZES FOR REACTION TO WHAT THEY SAW AND GIVING A ARE THEIR REFLECTION IN THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW IT MIGHT BE MASSAGED -- SILLY RADIUS HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF AREAS AND THIS -- GIVING THE DIRECTION TO P. YOU SEE AND WHAT. TOOLS MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN LANGUAGE AROUND THAT THAT AND THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER AREAS I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT IT TO THAT THAT. SHE IS A SHARED WITH WITH OUR STAFF FOR THEM TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COMMUNICATIONS NOT ONLY WITH WITH OUR SIDE BUT I BELIEVE THROUGH -- SENATOR -- OF MIKE MAKE CULTURE -- SENATOR DODD. AND SO TOMORROW I THINK THE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. TO TAKE COMMENTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. A AND THEN TRIED A FASHION. SOME TYPE OF A DIRECTION OBVIOUSLY SENATOR DODD AND I WILL. HILL WORK WITH THE THE SENATE CONFEREES AND OUR WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY CONFEREES WILL GET TOGETHER AND WE'LL -- WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN SORT OF PULL TOGETHER THE FINAL PIECES. THERE ARE STILL SOME OTHER PARTS OF THIS THAT STAFF IS IN THE PROCESS OF WERE SMITHING -- BUT I DO. BELIEVES THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK THE GOAL IS FOR US TO COME BACK TOMORROW. WITH THE PRODUCT THAT WE CAN. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO HAVE IT'S ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE A VOTE BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY. HAVING MEMBERS SIGNED ON TO THE CONFERENCE REPORT. AND SO YOU'D HAVE THREE WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE HAVE THREE MEMBERS FROM EACH -- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. OR FROM ITS DELEGATION TO TO SIGN ON TO THEN MAKE IT. IT'S WAY TO THE FLOOR. AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT WOULDN'T UNFOLDS OF THREE SENATORS AND THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- SIGN ON THEN. THEN THE A CONFERENCE REPORT MOVES FORWARD FOR THE FOR BOTH BODIES TO TO REVIEW. AND AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES UPPER DOWN VOTE. ON THE MATERIAL NOTHING COULD BE AMENDED AT THAT POINT SO. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WHERE WE WE THIS PART OF THIS PROCESS IS JUST TO CONTINUE TO BE TRANSPARENT TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC. WHERE WE ARE AT THE TIME THAT WE GET THERE AND SO THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS YOU'VE HEARD MEMBERS CHARACTERIZE IT IN? A VARIETY OF WAYS OTHER SOME WHO HAVE NOT YET COMPLETELY READ IT THE OVER ARCHING GOALS I THINK ARE CONSISTENT. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WE CAN BRING FORTH FOR TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND AND THEN I'M GONNA I'M TO RECOGNIZE SUMMER DOLLY. UNCLEAN WOULD AND THEN IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE PUBLIC. KEEP IN MIND THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON US AND SO -- IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO SHARE. OUR EACH PERSON. HE THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID OVER THE LAST MONTH. OF THEN YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO TO MAKE THAT -- THAT COMMENT SO WILL WE WILL CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO WISH TO TO MAKE A COMMENT BUT AGAIN. IF YOU REALLY. REALLY FEEL THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HEAR. AT ALMOST TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. WHEN THE CLOCK IS TICKING? WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO GET TO CLOSURE ON THIS. THEN WE WILL BE HAPPY GLAZER LATER. AND THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS. YEAH APPARENTLY HAD NO IMPACT. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO JUST OUT SO MAYBE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE FROM. SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED BY -- BIPARTISAN WORK SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN HERE AS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN HOUSE BE BIPARTISAN IF YOU'RE GONNA GET A BILL THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- BUT IS SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH. ACROSS THE AISLE ON FORESTRY ISSUES. AND FOR SOME REASON THAT I JUST WANT TO THROW THIS OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S WE THE STAFF. TO DO WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO. SENATOR WOULD NOT I HAVE HAD LANGUAGE OUT [inaudible] AND IT'S SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE GETS MESSED UP AND IT THE STUFF WE'RE ASKING FOR IS REASONABLE. IT'S NOT WE PUSHED BACK THE OTHER DAY WHEN THERE WAS TALK ABOUT CUTTING. THIRTY SEVEN INCH TREES ARE SOME CRAZY STUFF AND WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT WERE ASKING. FOR GOOD SOUND POLICY TO BE PUT IN PLACE IT'S ACTUALLY USEABLE AND SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT THIS THAT. AS MY FRIENDS ACROSS ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON ON STAFF. THAT THEY TAKE THIS LANGUAGE IN SERIOUSLY INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL'S BECAUSE IT IS GOOD POLICY AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SEE. WHEN YOU'VE DONE BIPARTISAN WORK ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND AT THE END? THE LANGUAGE GETS PUT IN AND THEN YOU'RE FORCED TO TOMORROW IF THE LANGUAGE IS A RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE YOU THEY'RE GONNA VOTE WITH IT. AND ACCEPT WHAT WAS THERE OR YOU'RE GONNA NOT AND I'M THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATING THING FOR ME OVER THE YEARS IS THAT. YOU WORK YOUR BILL THROUGH TWO HOUSES AND AT THE VERY LAST SECOND SOUTHERN CHANGES WHERE IT'S NOT USABLE ON THE GROUND THAT WAS MY POINT SO I WOULD JUST. ASK THAT YOU HELP. US SHEPHERD OUR LANGUAGE THROUGH AND IT STAY INTACT MY MIND IN I KNOW AND IS SIMILAR WHAT'S MINE. JUST GOOD POLICY AND WILL WORK THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL I'LL BE BRIEF AND A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I JUST WANNA I WANNA. POINT OUT THAT I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT BEFORE AND ONE IS THAT -- AND I AND I RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITY AND AND I DO NOT BEGRUDGE ANYBODY WANTING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTE ACCURATE. BUT WERE ONE OF THE REASONS I HAVE BEEN US. OUTSPOKEN ABOUT NOT WANTING TO CHANGE THE RULES REGARDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES IS THAT. FOR THE TWO LARGEST FIRES WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL REPORTS. AND IT TROUBLES ME THAT WE COULD MAKE POLICY DECISIONS THAT COULD HAVE LONG RANGE A FAX. BY CHANGING THE RULES GOING FORWARD WE HAVE RULES IN PLACE. AND AND AND I THINK -- BARRING THE THE OR PARRIS OF THESE REPORTS AYE I JUST AND HAVE A HAVE US HAVE A REAL DISCOMFORT IN MAKING. MAKING DECISIONS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE -- THE LANDSCAPE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. HIM AND THEN FINALLY I WON IT WITH -- YOU KNOW LOOK MIGHT MY ENVIRONMENTAL VOTING RECORD -- IS VERY VERY VERY STRONG AND I'M VERY PROUD OF MY ENVIRONMENTAL VOTE MONEY RECORD. HIS OWN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL CHANGES. THEY'RE NOT EASY DECISIONS FOR ME THEY ARE NOT IN ANY WAY EASY. AND I I I WOULDN'T. ORDINARILY CONSIDER SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE IT NOT. FOR THE STATE WE FIND OUR LAND IN AT THIS POINT. CLEARLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN SOME AREAS FOR ALONG TIME ISN'T WORKING. WE WOULDN'T HAVE. THE COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE BECOME SO INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THOSE POINTS AND AND I DO HOPE THAT WE COME. TO A RESOLUTION HERE WE COME WORK FOR IT AND AND NONE OF THE HOPEFULLY THIS THAT THIS DOESN'T LAST FOREVER [inaudible] I FRANKLY. OKAY WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST THANK YOU FOR THAT WE TAKE OUR FIRST. OF SPEAKER ONE MINUTE FOR EVERYONE. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE TIME WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HOLDEN CHAIRMAN DODD MARK JOSEPH ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES.

AS YOU POINTED OUT VICTIMS WILL NOT GET PAID THEY WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO REBUILD -- RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTS ANOTHER GENERATION CONTEXT WE CANCELED BIOMASS PLANTS WON'T HAVE CUSTOMERS. AND AT THE END THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL PRESENT RATEPAYERS WITH A BIG BILL AND THAT WILL BE A BIG INCREASE IN RATES. PAGE ME MAYBE AT FAULT FOR THESE FOR THE FIRE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IF SO. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY. THE ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM THEY CAN PAY WITHOUT HARMING CUSTOMERS. I WANT TO COMMEND THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING EVERY DOLLAR THE SHAREHOLDERS CAN GIVE WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR LIVES WITHOUT HARMING THE BREAK A SECOND. I SAY THAT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF EMPLOYEES OF THAT COMPANY. THAT'S NOT A BAIL OUT OF P. GENIE THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR REPAIRS.

DID YOU START IS A SUB PACKAGE THAT CAN. BEGIN TO PREVENT I'LL USE THAT THEY ADEQUATELY HARDEN THEIR GRID. AND NOW THANK YOU SENATOR DOT FOR PUTTING THE ADDED ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THOUGHT A LACK. YES YOU DID. IS A STARTING WHO WE GOT A LOOK BEYOND THAT AND WITH -- SEWING AND WOOD AND DOLLY THE TALK ABOUT FIRES GO WAY BEYOND THAT WE GO 90% OF FIRE FIFTEEN SO THIS IS A GOOD PACKAGE IN DOING THAT. AND DID IT. IS IT. FOR RATEPAYERS AND IS IT OUT A CLEAN DRESSING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF P. GENIE THAT'S FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

IS SECURITIZED WORKERS -- OF VICTIMS AND REPAIRS CAN BE DAMAGE TO YOUR POINT MISTER WOULD IF TODAY SOMEHOW. PGD COULD GET FINANCING. THE DIFFERENCE TO RATEPAYERS BETWEEN WHAT WOULD. WHAT WOULD COST RATEPAYERS FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND GET FINANCING AT THE RATES THEY CAN ACHIEVE IT? AND A SECURITIZATION FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS YOU SECURE TIES YOU SEE REPAIRS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

FOUR POINT PLAN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND MAYBE WONDER IF MAYBE AS A FEW FOLKS GOING OUT TALKING ABOUT THIS FOUR POINT PLAN -- BUT I REALLY DO THINK IT ENCAPSULATES A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS DUMB AND ACTUALLY THE SOLUTION. OF FOR MANY OF THE THAT THAT THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION AMONGST. THE COMMITTEE IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE DOWN THAT ROAD TO MAYBE MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE LANGUAGE [inaudible] I I YOU KNOW I'VE WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN A YOU KNOW ON OUR SIDE WE'VE REALLY. WITH THIS PLAN THIS BEFORE US TONIGHT -- IT KIND OF GOT A LITTLE BIT BACKWARDS WHERE WE WANT TO BE BUT YOU'LL COMPROMISE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE -- WE NEED TO BE FOR OUR RATEPAYERS AND ARE IN OUR VICTIMS. AND WITH THAT IN MIND I WANTED TO BRING UP -- ONE METRIC FOR RATEPAYERS. FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SECURE TIES. IT'S FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS A YEAR FOR A RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS. SO EVEN UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OVER TWENTY YEARS EVEN IF ID YA EVEN IF IT WAS FIVE BILLION DOLLAR HIT AFTER TAKING. ALL WE CAN GET FOR P. GENIE. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS A MONTH OR TWENTY FIVE BUCKS -- A YEAR FOR RATEPAYERS WITH WHICH I THINK YOU LOOK I'D RATHER NOT DO ANY BUT TO GET TO A DEALS TO MINIMUS I WILL SAY THAT THIS FOUR POINT PLAN. KIND OF TAKES US BACK A LITTLE BIT FROM OR WANTED TO BE IT AT THE BEGINNING BUT I AM OPEN TO THIS AND I THINK IT'S A A REASONABLE -- PLAN GOING FORWARD THAT I THINK THAT -- YOU FIRST OF ALL WE WE'VE GOT TO GET. THE DALAI -- YOU KNOW WOULD -- CHANGES IN THIS PLAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK WE LOSE OUT. WE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GET THAT IF WE DON'T. A BIT ON THE FORCE THREE THE SUNSET DAYS OF BROUGHT BY BROADENING BIOMASS THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. I I I WOULD SAY I WOULD SUPPORT YOU KNOW MOVING THAT DIRECTION IF WE HAD. A CONSENSUS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS WELL. SO. IT TAKES CHAD I THINK THIS IS HEALTHY SO I WILL I WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW. DOCTOR WOULD JULY IN THE SAND ALL DRY LAWN IN THE FOREST WE THEIR SOMETHINGS APT TO HAPPEN IN THIS BILL NUMBER -- ONE WE NEEDED THERE THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS YOU CAN ONLY TAKE BIOMASS OFF OF DID THE STREAMLINED IT PROCESSES OF THAT'S CRAZY WE NEED TO TAKE IT FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE WHOLE STATE IS GONNA BERNICIA TO THE MAP TO THE DAY. WE WILL TAKE UP FROM HIGH FIRE ZONE THREAT -- THERE'S TECHNICAL FIXES IN OUR LANGUAGE THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AND I WANT TO HAVE I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GO WITH THOSE I GUESS WE'VE SUBMITTED THOSE OF MY STAFF HAS WORKED WITH THE SENATE STAFF. AND AND THE ASSEMBLY STOP BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME PUSH BACK ON THOSE AREAS THAT ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO MAKE THIS THING WORK SO I GUESS FOR ME -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE I I NEED TO GO WHAT WITH MEMBERS TO GET SOME HELP. TO SEALED THE DEAL BECAUSE ME DOCTOR WOULD AND I ARE VERY OUT OF IT THAT IF YOU IF AND WE AND FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN IT. HAS NOT BEEN AT THE LEVEL NEEDS VIA. SO WE NEED TO SAY SOMEWHERE IN HERE THERE WERE GONNA PUT THE FUNDING IN THERE THERE'S AMOUNT WE'RE GONNA GET IT FROM SOMEWHERE -- WE'VE WE'VE PROPOSED GDR F. NICE MENTION THAT MY OF FIRST COMMENTS -- GENERAL FUND TO ME I DON'T CARE WHAT WE GET IT THERE'S THE STATE'S GOT PLENTY OF MONEY RIGHT NOW FOR LOTS OF THINGS. AND THE NUMBER ONE THING THIS FACING THIS WHOLE STATE IS FIRE AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FUND THIS AND SO. HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GO TO GET THAT RESOURCE AND DOCTOR WOULD I IF WITH THE BUT THE BIOMASS FIX WE WE THAT WE ADDED. FIVE FIVE YEAR CONTRACTS. WE NEEDED FUNDING AND THEN WE NEED A FEW TECHNICAL FIXES I THINK THE SENATE -- STAFF WAS STARTING TO COME AROUND -- TO YOU KNOW THAT THAT. WE NEED SOME DIRECTION I GUESS OF WHERE WHERE WE GET THAT RESOURCE. OF OWE ANSWER ONCE SURE I JUST WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE IN IN THE FORM OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IN IN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION THAT WE NEED. TO BE AWARE OF IT AND KEEP IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD THIS BILL DEALS WITH VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES BUT ON THE WHOLE PREVENTION ISSUE -- I GOT A BILL S. B. TWELVE SAY IT DEALS WITH -- CONTROLLED BURNS BRINGING CAO FIRE AND STATE. OTHER FEATHER AND FEDERAL LOCAL AGENCIES TOGETHER TO WORK ON FIRE MANAGEMENT. I DO THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN MONEY -- ALLOCATED FOR THAT SO AS WE LOOK AT AS WE LOOK AT THIS IS IT'S MORE THAN JUST A SINGLE BILL. AND THERE IS MORE THAN JUST A YEAH YOU KNOW A VERY LIMITED -- FUNDING MECHANISM THERE HAVE BEEN -- I THINK IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND PERHAPS GOING FOR WE COULD FIND SOME OTHER RESOURCES FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO DEAL WITH A AYE BROADER -- APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESE WE'VE GOT THAT THE ISSUE OF A BIOMASS BUT WE ALSO HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX SOME OF WHICH ARE BEING FUNDED SO. I THINK IT'S A IT'S A BIGGER CONVERSATION -- THAT WE NEED TO HAVE NOT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ANY MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT IS BUT JUST AS WE THINKABOUT THIS. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS GOING ALONG A GOING ON THIS WELL NOW I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LIFE APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK IT'S ALSO SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAD ONE OF OUR HEARINGS A PRESENTATION OF ALL THE BILLS THAT ARE ACTIVE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO REFERENCE THAT I THINK APPROPRIATELY CONNECTED TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE. OF THIS NOW I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST WAY I CONNECTS. SIR FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK WHAT'S BEEN AFFECTED TO THIS POINT IS WHEN. BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET EVERYONE AROUND THIS TABLE -- TOGETHER AT ANY ONE TIME YOU KNOW HAVING ANOTHER. OF POSTED MEETING SO WHAT'S BEEN AFFECTED I THINK WAS WHEN THE SENATE CONFEREES WERE WORK WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE CHAIR. AND ASSEMBLY CONFEREES AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT. WERE WERE SORT OF NARROWING DOWN IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THAT BUT WHATEVER OUTSTANDING PARTS. THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THEN -- SENATOR DODD AND I CAN GET TOGETHER AND AND SORT OF MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MOVING APPROPRIATELY -- WITH THE APPROPRIATE STAFF BECAUSE ALSO. THERE IS COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- THAT THOSE CHANNELS STAY OPEN IN THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCESS -- FEEDBACK THAT WAY SO I THINK. WELL WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THE LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MOVING IN THE WAY THAT WE ALL -- ANTICIPATING THAT IT WILL AND THEN SENATOR DODD CAN. SHARE INFORMATION WE CAN GET TOGETHER AND FIND OUT WHAT -- OUTSTANDING ELEMENTS BECAUSE A I KNOW A NUMBER OF YOUR MEMBERS FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE DOCUMENT SO TO THAT EXTENT THEY MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO SHARE WITH YOU. AND THEN OF COURSE THE GOAL IS FOR US TO RECONVENE AS A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- AND HAVE A FINAL DOCUMENT THAT WE CAN. A TAKE ACTION ON TOMORROW. BUT I GUESS THE GOAL WOULD BE TO TRY TO DO IT IS EARLY IN THE DAY AS WE CAN BUT YOU KNOW WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE -- BUT CERTAINLY -- NO LATER THAN. WE HAVE TO DO IT EARLY. CONSPIRACY EARLY AS WE CAN. SO IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] YES -- IS ACTUALLY SENATOR STONE THE BROUGHT THE SUPPER EARLIER AND I'VE NOT SEEN THIS IN THE LANGUAGE BUT IN REGARDS TO A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. I THINK FIVE YEARS IS MUCH -- TOO EARLY I WOULD THINK AT LEAST TEN YEARS IF NOT -- IF NOT LONGER SO AGAIN I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT LANGUAGE BUT IF SENATOR SENATOR CORRECTIVE IS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. ON THIS I DO BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST EXTENDED HER AND I'M NOT SURE WE HAD A LEAD ON A SUNSET OF THE NEEDS OF SOARED. IT'S IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WHICH WHICH PIECE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OKAY [inaudible] GOT IT. I GOT IT [inaudible] OKAY. RATHER THAN A FIVE YEAR ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE SUNSET FOR THE ENTIRE BILL. WHO CLOSER SAYING I THINK IN IN REGARDS TO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROVISIONS I'M NOT SURE THAT ANY PART OF THIS SHOULD BE AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- FOREST. MANAGEMENT ORG OR FIRE PREVENTION I THINK. A FIVE YEAR SUNSET IS JUST TO TOO EARLY I THINK TEN YEARS SHOULD BE A MINIMUM I DON'T KNOW WHAT PARTS. THAT THERE'S FIVE YEAR BUT I WOULD THINK THAT TEN YEARS IT SHOULD BE A SHOULD BE A MINIMUM AGAIN I THINK. THAT DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S CRAFTED BUT FIVE IS JUST SEEMS TO BE TOO SOON. IT'S AT PAGE THIRTY ONE OF THE FIRST DRAFT FROM LAST NIGHT. JUST BEFORE SECTION. TWENTY FOUR IT'S REFERRED TO SECTION. TWENTY THREE IF I COULD -- MEMBERS I THINK IT. REFER COULD HAVE I THINK WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT IF WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE I THINK GATHERING THE INFORMATION IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM MEMBERS. AND ALSO FROM THE PUBLIC I THINK WE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE CAUCUS. AND THEN -- WILL GET BACK TOGETHER OF THE TWO CHAIRS AND AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MOVING WITH THE STAFF'S. SO THAT WE CAN SHEPHERDED ALL THE WAY THROUGH [inaudible] THE OKAY. IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS
