01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.085
ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:05.286

CALIFORNIANS ARE BEHIND ON RENT

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.524
THAT'S NEARLY ONE IN FIVE

01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:10.825
RENTERS IN THE FIFTH.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.442
ALTHOUGH HOUSINGINSECURITY AS

AFFECTED COMMUNITIESOF COLOR

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.645
LONG BEFORE COVER NINETEEN

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.413
APPEARED THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.915
AND SUBSEQUENT ECONOMIC COVER

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:36.484
IS DEEPENING THESE INEQUALITIES.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.119
THERE IS SOME LIGHT AT THE END

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:38.953
OF THE TUNNEL NOW WITH THE

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.854
FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.222
GOVERNMENT AND ITS PROGRAMMATIC

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.391
APPROACH WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.392
A DEGREE OF STABILITY FOR FEW

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.327
MONTHS BOTH RENTERS AND

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:49.364
LANDLORDS. THIS IS A CRUCIAL

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:51.566
URGENCIA FORD BUT OUR WORK IS

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.234
FAR FROM OVER. I AM DEEPLY

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.569
CONCERNED THAT THIS PLAN GIVES

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.104
LANDLORDS TOO MUCH POWER IN

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:57.372
ALREADY IN BALLOTS

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.207
RELATIONSHIP. AND ULTIMATELY

01:27:59.273 --> 01:27:59.907
LEAVES THE FATE OF LOW INCOME

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.342
TENANTS IN THE HANDS OF THE

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:04.012
LANDLORD. IN THIS PROPOSAL I

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:04.846
WANT TO POINT OUT TO MY

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.280
COLLEAGUES IN THIS PROPOSAL IF

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:08.316
A LANDLORD POPS IN OPS

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:10.418
INVOLUNTARILY. THE RECEIPT

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:11.786
PERCENT OF RENT THAT FROM THIS

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:13.955
FUNDING. WHILE THE FOR GO TO

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:17.392
REMAIN 20% IF THE LAND OPS I.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.961
IN A TENT UP. THEN THE RISK ONE

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.130
FIVE OR OF RENT TO FOR RENT

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:24.799
THAT FROM THIS. EVEN THOUGH. IN

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.434
BOTH CASE ALL MONEY GOES TO THE

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:31.572
LAW. THIS MEANS A OUR LAND TO

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:33.307
SO NOT. TO VOLUNTEER ACCEPT THE

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:36.110
FUNDING THAT IS OFFERED TO THEM.

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:38.246
LOW INCOME TENER RECEIVE 75%

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:41.883
SUPPORT 75% LESS SUPPORT. NOW I

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:43.317
UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION IS TO

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.952
INCENTIVIZELANDLORDS TO OPT

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.854
INTO THE REALLY FUNDS BUT IS

01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:48.790
INCUMBENT ON US TO DO MORE TO

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:51.392
PROTECT TAX. FOR STARTERS WE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.294

THESE LANDLORDS ARE NOT A BIG

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:43.423
CORPORATION LANDLORDS THAT OWNS

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.926
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:50.764
THESE ARE LANDLORDS. WHO BOUGHTA RENTAL TO HELP SUPPLEMENT A

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:53.800
RETIREMENT INCOME OR SUPPLEMENT

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:56.270
THE PART TIME JOB. SO PLEASE DO

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:57.571
UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.573
LANDLORDS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.775
BIG CORPORATE LANDLORDS. THESE

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.211
ARE THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.879
JUST LIKE THE MOM AND POP.

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:09.383
BUSINESSES THEY TO HAVE SUFFER.

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:12.019
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE THEY

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:14.721
HAVE GONE OUT A YEAR NOW

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:18.258
WITHOUT ANY INCOME. THEY ARE

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:19.993
ALSO TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.261
TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AS

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.997
WELL. AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.532
THEIR CHILDREN ARE TAKEN CARE

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:27.334
OF OR THEIR GRANDCHILDREN OR

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:29.002
TAKING CARE OF. AND IF THEY'RE

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.771
HELPING THE CHILDREN IS BECAUSE

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:34.508
THE CHILDREN WHO ARE POLY ADULT.

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:36.910
WHO LOST THEIR JOB. SO THIS IS

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:39.713
NOT ABOUT THE BIG CORPORATION

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.582
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS THINKING UP

01:43:41.648 --> 01:43:44.718
TOP A LANDLORDS. AS WE MOVE

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:46.820
FORWARD. I ASK THAT YOU

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:49.256
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING AS THE

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:51.959
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. ONE

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:54.728
THERE'S NO TIME FRAME AS FAST

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.063
AS THEY NEED TO GET THE RENTAL

01:43:56.129 --> 01:44:00.033
SYSTEM MONEY. IS IT GONNA BE

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:04.204
WEEKS. ONCE WE KNOW EDT SYSTEM

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.106
OF THE GOVERNOR OF OUR STATE

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:08.342
GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING WELL.

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:09.810
I HOPE IT'S NOT TO BE THE SAME

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:14.481
SYSTEM OR SIMILAR LEE RUN.

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.450
THERE'S ALSO NO LANGUAGE FOR

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:17.618
THE FOR THE LANDLORDS ARE

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.653
REQUIRED TO SEND TO THE

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.454
TENANTS. REGARDING THE RENTAL

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.589
SYSTEM PROGRAMS. ARE THERE ANY

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:25.058
SPECIFIC. THAT WOULD BE COMING

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.693
OUT TO SYSTEM LANDLORDS OR THEY

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.596
SUPPOSED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:30.931
DRAFT SOMETHING UP. AS

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:32.132
MENTIONED IS A SMALL MOM AND

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:34.234
POPS LANDLORDS. THAT'S VERY

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:35.802
BURDENSOME BECAUSE HIRING AN

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:38.038
ATTORNEY TO DRAFT. A CONTRACT

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:41.208
OR NOTICE. GIVE ME A THOUSAND

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:44.378
DOLLARS. EASILY THEY TOO DON'T

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.747
HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY WE NEED

01:44:46.813 --> 01:44:49.282
TO HELP THEM AND HAVE A UNIFORM.

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:55.055
DOCUMENT FOR THEM TO USE. WHAT

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.957
IF WHAT IF THE TENANT REFUSES

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:59.292
TO APPLY FOR THE SYSTEM. IS THE

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:02.396
LANDLORD ON THE HOOK. AND THEN

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:03.797
WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:06.133
RENTAL RELIEF. I KNOW THE BILL

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:07.434
IT DOES ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:08.769
BIT BUT I THINK IT CAN GO A

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:11.138
LITTLE FURTHER. TO MAKING SURE

01:45:11.204 --> 01:45:13.473
THAT IT'S CLEAR FOR THE TENANT

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.442
AND LANDLORD AND THEY KNOW WHAT

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:19.946
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. TO

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.248
RECEIVE THE FUNDS FOR THE

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:25.852
LANDLORDS MUST SHOW GOOD FAITH.

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.788
THAT THEY HAVE TRIED EVERY

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:30.023
OTHER RENTAL ASSISTANCE

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:31.892
PROGRAMS TO HELP THE TENNIS.

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:33.360
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:34.928
GOOD FAITH MEAN. I THINK THAT

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:38.632
DEFINITION. MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.167
IN MY UNDERSTANDING VERSUS

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.769
YOURS FOR AN ATTORNEY. OR

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:45.906
SOMEBODY ELSE SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:47.908
IF WE HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:49.710
LANGUAGE SO WE CAN ALL

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:51.411
UNDERSTAND WHAT GOOD FAITH MEAN

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:52.979
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL NOT

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.415
ONLY FOR THE TENANT BUT ALSO

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:58.952
FOR THE LANDLORD AS WELL. LAST

01:45:59.019 --> 01:45:59.953
I KNOW THAT THERE'S THREE

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.656
DISTRIBUTION BROWN'S. IS THE

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:04.257
RENTAL ASSISTANCE MONEY

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:05.759
DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF NEED.

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:08.428
IF SO. HOW LONG DOES EACH ROUND

01:46:08.495 --> 01:46:12.766
TAKE. WILL BE DAYS WEEKS MONTHS

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.301
BECAUSE THIS GOES TO ONLY SIX

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:18.305
MONTHS. WE DON'T HAVE TIME WE

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.707
NEED TO MOVE FAST THEY NEED THE

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:23.310
ASSISTANT NOW AND SO I ASK THAT

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.712
ASWE MOVE FORWARD IN LOOKING

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:26.213
AT THE BILL AND HOW TO

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:28.448
IMPLEMENT IT THANK YOU PLEASE

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:30.150
LOOK AT THESE AND CONSIDER AND

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:33.053
BE REMINDED. THAT WE NEED TO

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.689
HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND NOT

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:37.591
JUST ONE OVER ANOTHER BECAUSE

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:40.427
THEY ALL NEED HELP. WE NEED TO

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:42.763
GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. ASK

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:47.501

ARE NOT ASKING FOR A PERPETUAL

01:46:58.378 --> 01:47:00.380
ADDICTION MOTOR MORATORIUM ON

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.215
TOP OF THE FEDERAL MORATORIUM

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:03.550
THAT ALREADY EXISTS

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.352
CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR THE

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:07.220
RIGHTS TO GET BACK TO WORK

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:09.256
SHORT OF THAT THERE AT LEAST

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:10.190
ASKING TO GET THEIR

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.825
UNEMPLOYMENT CHECK RATHER THAN

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:14.294
HAVING TO WATCH IT LAND IN A

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.962
STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:17.497
WE'VE HAD ABOUT THE NATION'S

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.866
WORST UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS MOST

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:22.435
DYSFUNCTIONAL. UNEMPLOYMENT

OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE LAST

01:47:23.503 --> 01:47:25.572
YEAR. AND THIS MEASURE IS AN

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:28.175
EXCUSE FOR NEGLECTING THOSE

01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:30.811
STAGGERING PROBLEMS. I AM NOT

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:33.613
GOING TO. ENABLE THAT BLACKED

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.816
BY VOTING FOR IT. INSTEAD I'M

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:37.384
GOING TO AGAIN IN FOR THIS

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:40.353
LEGISLATURE TO ASSERT ITSELF AS

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.054

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:45.025
CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO THE LIVES

HOPE. I RISE WITH THE LITTLE

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:06.413
CONCERN. AND A HEALTHY DOSE OF

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:09.850
SKEPTICISM AND- I DON'T SAY

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:14.221
THAT LIGHTLY- THERE ARE A-

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:15.555
THIRTY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:17.190
THAT HAVE A POPULATION OF LESS

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:18.825
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. I

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:22.629
REPRESENT FOUR OF THEM. ALL

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:23.230
THOSE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:24.564
TREATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:25.966
BIGGER COUNTY'S AGAIN GET

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:27.500
DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FROM THE

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:28.368
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:30.370
OTHER A MECHANISM SUPPORT MY

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:32.205
SMALLER COUNTIES ARE GOING TO

01:48:32.272 --> 01:48:32.739
HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH EXTRA

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:35.075
HOOPS. NOW YESTERDAY WE HEARD

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:35.609
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:37.510
SPECIAL SET ASIDE ADDITIONAL

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:39.613
RESOURCES THERE WHICH

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.748
PRESUMABLY WILL MAKE EVERYTHING

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:43.850
EQUAL. AND MY SO MY SKEPTICISM

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.385
COMES FROM WHAT HAPPENED DURING

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.887
THE CURES ACT NGUYEN SMALLER

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:48.655
COUNTIES SIMPLY WEREN'T TREATED

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.690
EQUALLY. RESOURCES WENT TO

01:48:50.757 --> 01:48:51.925
LARGER COUNTIES A LOT MORE

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.326
RESOURCES WENT TO LARGER

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.095
COUNTIES ON A BET THAT SOME OF

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:56.529
THOSE COUNTIES WOULD ACTUALLY

01:48:56.596 --> 01:48:58.365
HAVE MORE OUTBREAKS OF

01:48:58.431 --> 01:49:00.634
CORONAVIRUS THAN THEY DID WHILE

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.068
SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:03.770
LIKE. OF MY FRIEND FROM THE

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:05.338
DESERT DOWN THERE HAD THE

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.340
HIGHEST RATES IN THE STATE. SO

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:09.609
MY SKEPTICISM IS. AND I'M NOT

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.244
GOING TO APOLOGIZE. FOR

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:14.281
ADVOCATING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS.

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:17.284
IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WE OFTEN

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.853
GET SHORT SHRIFT. BUT THIS

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.320
ISN'T JUST ABOUT RURAL

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.422
COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:24.691
INVOLVED WHO HAVE THE BIGGEST

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:28.428
RISK OF EVICTION LIVE IN OUR

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:30.230
LARGE URBAN AREAS AS WELL. NOW

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:33.033
MY SKEPTICISM COMES IN PART. WE

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:34.768
HEARD ABOUT A NEW WEBSITES CAN

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.769
BE ROLLED OUT IN MOBILE

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.871
APPLICATIONS AND ALLOW PEOPLE

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:40.373
TO DO TO ACCESS THIS. WELL IF

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.107
YOU WANT TO DRIVE IN MY

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.609
DISTRICT. ABOUT HALF THE

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:44.311
DISTANCE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.779
ABOUT A SEVEN HOUR DRIVE IN

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:46.680
HALF THAT DISTANCE YOU DON'T

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:49.416
HAVE. OU DON'T HAVE SO ACCESS.

01:49:49.482 --> 01:49:50.917
WE FOUND OUT NINETEEN

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:53.019
CORONAVIRUS TIMES HERE. THAT

01:49:53.086 --> 01:49:54.354
KIDS CAN'T GET ACCESS TO

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:55.956
INTERNET OUT INTO THE INTERNET

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:58.458
IT JUST DOESN'T EXIST. SO HOW

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.527
DO WE REACH THESE PEOPLE THAT

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:01.728
ARE THE HIGHEST RISK FOR

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:03.263
ADDICTION HOW DO WE GET THEM

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:08.501
THAT INFORMATION. THESE ARE

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.003
GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.570
AN EXTRA HOOP TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:12.639
MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO I'M GONNA

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:16.109
WATCH THIS WITH. CONCERN AND I

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:17.811
HOPE THOSE METRICS PROVE ME

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:20.413
WRONG- BUT THIS THIS VIRUS HAS

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.815
SHOWN THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT SOME

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:24.017
SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES HERE IN IN

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.218
OUR SYSTEMS AND WE NEED TO

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:26.753
OVERCOME THEM AND I HOPE THAT

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.689
EACH CD. HAS THE BAND WITH TO

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:31.658
BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS. PEOPLE

DEPEND ON THE RENT TO

SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME. AND

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:42.588
pTHAT THEY RECEIVE DOESN'T JUST

01:57:42.655 --> 01:57:44.424
GO TO PAY THE MORTGAGE. BUT IT

01:57:54.066 --> 01:57:55.201
PROPERTIES WHICH COULD EASILY

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:57.537
BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE. TO THOSE

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.906

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:02.041
WORSE LOSE THEIR PROPERTY TO

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:02.708
THE BANK WHICH COULD

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:06.913
ULTIMATELY. DISPLACING TENANTS.

01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:08.548
THIS BILL HAS A LOT TO OFFER

01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:10.316

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:21.227
REASON WHY WE'RE STANDING UP

ONE. MEMBERS A YEAR AGO AS WE

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:04.136
STOOD HERE ON THIS FLOOR AND

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:05.905
LISTEN TO OUR GOVERNOR SPEAK

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:08.508
ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:11.911
AND RECOVERY WE HAD NO IDEA

01:59:11.978 --> 01:59:14.113
THAT JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.648
WE'D BE FACED WITH THE WORST

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:17.850
PANDEMIC WITH JOB LOSS THAT

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:21.020
WE'VE NEVER SEEN. AND DEATH

01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:23.189
THAT WE'VE NEVER IMAGINED. JUST

01:59:23.256 --> 01:59:25.791
A FEW NIGHTS AGO AS ALL OF US

01:59:25.858 --> 01:59:26.993
COME TO SACRAMENTO TO DO OUR

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:29.028
WORK. WE HEARD THOSE WINDS

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:31.397
BLOW. WE SAW THE TEMPERATURES

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:34.267
DROP. AND WE SAW THAT PEOPLE

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.068
DIED ON THE STREETS RIGHT HERE

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:38.671
IN SACRAMENTO. DIED OF

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:41.607
HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:44.844
NOWHERE TO GO. WE CAN TALK

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:47.780
ABOUT THIS BEING IN PERFECT AND

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:48.347
WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT IS IN

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:51.284
PERFECT. WE'RE SADDENED AND

01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:53.753
HORRIFIED BY THE EDG CLAIMS AND

01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:56.923
FRAUD. WE'RE DEVASTATED BY THE

01:59:56.989 --> 02:00:00.993
DEATH. AND EVEN MORE SHOCKED BY

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.828
THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WORK AND

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:05.131
CANNOT GO BACK TO WORK INTEL

02:00:05.197 --> 02:00:06.499
THE VIRUS AND THE NUMBERS

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:09.802
DECLINE. BUT COULD NOT ACT

02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:11.871
BECAUSE OF AN IMPERFECT BILL

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:14.473
WOULD MEAN. PUTTING MORE PEOPLE

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:17.209
INTO HOMELESSNESS. WE ALREADY

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.778
HAD AN ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:20.780
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND ADDING

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:25.851
MORE. PEOPLE TO BECOME HOMELESS

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:27.954
JUST ADDS AND STRETCHES OUR

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.889
GOVERNMENT EVEN FURTHER. WE

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:31.457
ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:34.827
BEEN EVICTED. IT TAKES MANY

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:37.096
MANY YEARS FOR THEM TO RECOVER

02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:39.665
TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO HOUSING

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:41.701
AGAIN AND IT ALSO TAKES

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.869
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WHETHER

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:45.972
IT'S STILL A SECRET ATTORNEY

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:46.872
WHETHER IT'S A CLEAR IN A

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:48.941
VACATION AND WE KNOW THAT

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:51.277
KEEPING THEM IN THEIR HOME IS

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:52.478
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:55.014
HOMELESSNESS. SO I DO SUPPORT

02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:57.917
THIS BILL I WILL BE PRAYING

02:00:57.984 --> 02:01:00.653
THAT THE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE TO

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:03.122
SEEK RELIEF FOR RENTERS AND

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:05.858
LANDLORDS WERE WORK MUCH MORE

02:01:05.925 --> 02:01:06.892
EFFICIENTLY THAN WE'VE SEEN

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:12.365

IS A NECESSARY MEASURE. THAT'S

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.696
NEEDED IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS.

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:45.731
BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THREE

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:47.233
POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:49.802

MANY OF US KNOW ALL IT TOOK WAS

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:58.544
ONE. ONE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT.

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:00.579
ONE DAY OF LOST WAGES ONE

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:03.749
UNEXPECTED COST TO JEOPARDIZE

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:06.285
THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT. THE

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:07.820
COUNTY MONTEREY THE LARGEST

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:11.123
COUNTY THAT I REPRESENT 47% OF

02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:13.426
HOUSEHOLDS WERE RENTERS IN TWO

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:16.395
THOUSAND NINETEEN. OF THOSE 47%

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:19.965
ABOUT HALF PAID 35% OR MORE OF

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:23.836
THEIR INCOME ON RENT. NOW THIS

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:26.739
PANDEMIC SHUT DOWNS THEY PUT

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:29.675
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE AND UP. A

02:02:29.742 --> 02:02:32.812
PRECARIOUS SITUATION. MANY HAVE

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:35.581
LOST JOBS FACED SUBSTANTIALLY

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:38.284
REDUCED INCOMES. THEY WORRY

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:41.654
THAT THEY THEIR FAMILIES COULD

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:43.756
END UP ON THE STREETS OR LIVING

02:02:43.823 --> 02:02:46.158
IN CROWDED HOUSING CONDITIONS

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:48.260
WITH FRIENDS WITH FAMILIES

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:50.196
LEAVING THEM EVEN MORE

02:02:50.262 --> 02:02:52.264
VULNERABLE THE CORONAVIRUS.

02:02:52.331 --> 02:02:54.266
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:56.702
BLACK AND BROWN AREAS OF THE

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:59.305

SINCE THIS PANDEMIC STARTED 50%

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:20.960
IF WE DO NOT EXTEND THIS

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:25.765
MORATORIUM. THEN WE ARE FAILING.

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:28.200
WE ARE FAILING TO UNDERSTAND

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:31.036
THE GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION.

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.538
THE UNPREDICTABLE IN THE

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:35.374
VULNERABLE POSITION THAT MANY

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:37.443

NINETY ONE IS NOT PERFECT. BUT

02:03:47.019 --> 02:03:48.254
IT IS GOING TO HELP PREVENT A

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.455
WAVE OF EVICTIONS AND

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:51.824
SUBSEQUENT HOMELESSNESS DURING

NEED TO APPROVE A BUDGET BILL

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:33.552
IN JANUARY IT IS BECAUSE WE

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:36.889

MORE FAMILIES OUT ON THE STREET

THERE ARE MANY OUT THERE NOW IN

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:49.268
THE RAIN AND THE WIND AND COLD

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:52.271
WEATHER SUGGESTS THE SIZE OF

02:06:52.338 --> 02:06:54.373
THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE. IN

THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN HOW

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:04.516
QUICKLY SOMETHING LIKE OF IT.
