WITH THE WAY WE CAN NOW TURN TO THE BILLS BEFORE US TODAY- MISTER RAMOS HAS ASKED FOR SEND AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO FIRST THIS AFTERNOON SINCE THE BILL WILL BE TAKING UP FOR PRESENTATION ONLY. AND HE'S SUCH A NICE GUY THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD SAY NO TO HIM SO THE COMMITTEE IS. DELIGHTED TO WELCOME MISTER RAMOS. ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT HAVE A VOTE ON THE BILL MYSTERON MOST WELCOME. BUT YEAH. THANK YOU I'M- GERMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO IT IS MEANT TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITIES- RETAIL THEFT- WOMEN ALL ACTIVITY SHOOTING IN THE USE OF- VLR- B. L. PR LICENSE PLATE READERS. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO WOULD PROVIDE THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN SHARE A LPR DATA WITH OUT OF STATE OR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO LOCATE A VEHICLE OR PERSON RESPONSIBLY SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A. L. P. R. DATA HAS PROVEN TO BE USEFUL AND SUCCESSFUL A SUCCESSFUL TOOL WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTIGATING CRIMES AND IDENTIFYING OR EXCLUDING SUSPECTS SUCH AS RECENTLY. IN THE CITY OF VICTORVILLE A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL WAS SHOT. AND THE PERSON THAT. SHOT THE NINE YEAR OLD GIRL FLED AND WASN'T FOUND IN NEVADA IN ANOTHER STATE THAT'S THE REASON WHY I INTRODUCED THIS BILL. ALSO TO ADDRESS RETAIL THEFT THAT HAS BECOME A COMMON DAY OCCURRENCE- WITHIN OUR LOCAL AREAS. THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY START TO GIVE UP LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS TO CURB THESE ISSUES THESE ISSUES THAT WE SEE THAT VIOLENT CRIMES CONTINUE TO- MOVE FORWARD IN A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THE RISE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ADDITIONALLY A BIG REASON TO MOVE FORWARD FOR ME. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL WAS ALSO THE CASES OF INVOLVING MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN THAT MANY TIMES AS PERPETRATORS HELPED LEAD ACROSS STATE LINES. AND STILL MANY OF THOSE CASES GO UNSOLVED SO BEING ABLE TO USE THE TOOLS AND TO ADD ADEQUATELY EQUIPPED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE THEM IS THE MAIN PREMISE OF THIS BILL. EXISTING LAW GOVERNING THE USE OF A LPR DATA ATTEMPTS ATTEMPTS TO STRIKE A BALANCE WITH THOSE- AND THE LAWS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO START TO TALK ABOUT BALANCE OF WHERE WILL. BE WITH LONG. IN THE TOOL TO AND THE OUR COMMUNITY HAS SAY. CERTAINLY MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN'S HAVE HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT NOW IT'S RISE TO THE LEVEL ADVOCACY BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING CLOSURE TO THOSE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO START TO TALK ABOUT A BALANCE HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE A BALANCE THAT WILL PROTECT. OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF ISSUES AND PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AS WELL AS PROVIDING A SAFETY ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND RESOLVING CRIMES ARE AFFECTED SO MANY OF US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO FIND THAT BALANCE IF THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE FOUND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE TO. TALK ABOUT AND HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXISTING LAW ENFORCED BILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND SHARE RESOURCES TOWARDS THE GOAL OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS THAT'S THE MAIN GOAL THAT WE SET OUT. TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH THIS BILL IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION TO CREATE A BILL THAT CIRCUMVENT IT THE WILL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PUT UNNECESSARY. PAUL IN HARM'S WAY WE BELIEVE IN THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT CRIMES SHOULD BE ABLE TO. PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD AND GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOL TO BE ABLE TO BE A QUIPPED TO BRING TO SPEEDILY- THE CONVICTION OF THOSE THATARE THERE AND TO SAVE VICTIMS RIGHTS OUT THERE FROM CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. OUR GOAL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD- WE MOVED IT OUT OF TRANSPORTATION WE TOOK SEVERAL AMENDMENTS SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT WE BELIEVE STARTED TO MOVE THE PENDULUM TO THAT BALANCE TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AMENDMENTS WE HAVE MADE TO THE BILL WERE IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO OPPOSITION CONCERNS WE HAVE IT CLEAR THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CANNOT SHARE. THIS DATA WITH STATES THAT ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA VALUES OR HAVE STRICT LAWS AGAINST WOMEN'S RIGHTS. WE HAVE MET WITH OPPOSITION TO STAKEHOLDERS AND WILL CONTINUE AND COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THEM TO FIND THAT BALANCE THAT BALANCE THAT SHOWS THAT WHEN SOMEBODY DOES PERPETRATE A CRIME LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD GETTING SHOT NAY FLEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. ND ALSO FOR THOSE AT THE CONTINUE TO IMPACT MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN WITH THOSE CASES ARE STILL THE HIGHEST THE HIGHEST OF UNSOLVED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY RESOURCE AND TOOL IS AVAILABLE TO THE FAMILIES THE FAMILIES IS STILL LOOK FOR CLOSURE FOR THAT CRIME THAT'S BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM. WE WILL WORK HARD TO CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO FIND THAT BALANCE TO FIND THAT BALANCE MOVING FORWARD AND TO BRING BACK A BILL THAT MEETS THAT BALANCE NOW IS THE TIME THAT WE START TO WE HAVE TO START TO DISCUSS. THE BALANCE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON ISSUES LIKE THIS ONE THAT PROTECTS PEOPLE'S RIGHT BUT ALSO PUBLIC HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO FLEET- OUT OF STATE THAT WERE ABLE TO- HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. WITH ME TODAY IS A COREY. SAYS HELLO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION.

HAS THE TOOLS TO FIGHT AND SOLVE CRIMES MURDER KIDNAPPING ORGANIZED CRIMES- SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES OUR TENT HAS NEVER BEEN TO FACILITATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS- AND PROPOSALS THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT WE HOPE THAT THAT'S EVIDENCED BY THE AMENDMENTS- WE'VE TAKEN THUS FAR TO THE BILL- WE KNOW THE BILL IS GONNA MOVE FORWARD TODAY- BUT WE- YOU KNOW AS THE OTHER SIDE- WITH.

TWO PROPOSED TO EAT THE CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONSTANTLY MONITOR STATE AND- LOCAL LAWS ACROSS. FIFTY OTHER STATE PRODUCTOR EN EL PR SHARE EVERY SINGLE TIME IN THE STATE PARK OR LOCAL LAW IT'S PAST EACH EIGHT WOULD NOT ONLY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PATH OF BLOOD BUT THEN. YOU THEIR ENTIRE SHIP AND LYFT FOR WHAT COULD BE DOZENS OF INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN THAT STATE THERE'S NO PRACTICAL WAY FOR THEM TO ENSURE THAT EVERY AGENCY GOES THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVERY SINGLE TIME AND NO PRACTICAL WAY TO INSURE THAT THE SHARING IS IN FACT CUT OFF BY EACH.

IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT OR ICE. THIS IS CRUCIAL TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. ASSEMBLY TWENTY NINETEEN ACES USE LPR DATA TO FIND AND DEPORT IMMIGRANTS. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO WOULD PUT IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS BACK IN HARM'S WAY. BY MARCH AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WHICH WE APPRECIATE THE GOOD FAITH OFFERING. WELL THE MEMBERS REFERENCE THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT THE BILL OULD STILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA AGENCIES THE SENDER LPR DATA TO OUT OF STATE AGENCIES WHICH COULD EASILY SENATE ON. ICE THE BILL WOULD ALSO UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S STATUS AS A SANCTUARY FOR PEOPLE SEEKING ABORTIONS AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. EIGHT THE CRIMINALIZES CARE COMMUTE CALIFORNIA LPR DATA BY DAD TO FIGHT AND PUNISH THEIR RESIDENTS WHO. CAME TO CALIFORNIA FOR CARE. THE MARKET MEN AND- TO THE TRIED TO SOLVE THIS. BY REQUIRING CAL AGENCY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MANY FEDERAL AN OUT OF STATE AGENCIES THAT SEEK THEIR LPR DATA WILL USE THE HARMONIES GROUPS BUT IT SIMPLY IS NOT PRACTICAL TO REQUIRE CALIFORNIA EIGHT.

MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS INDIGENOUS WINDOW. WOMEN AND I THINK ALL OF US AROUND THE COMMITTEE TABLE HERE ARE HEARING. A LOT FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY ABOUT KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE- AS YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE. SOME STATES THAT HAVE. PASSED WAS I THINK A LOT OF US WANT TO BE VERY REPREHENSIBLE- THAT THREATEN THE CIVIL LIBERTIES. I'M COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO PART. WHETHER THAT'S OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. OF PEOPLE SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS YOUR LIFE TALKING ABOUT- I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. AND I THINK YOU USE AN IMPORTANT WORD HERE WHICH IS BALANCE AND IT'S ABOUT THREADING THAT NEEDLE. THE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN. AFFORD TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS BUT ALSO. DO SO WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN A NUANCED WAY THAT IS GOING TO PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHTS.

FOUNDER SAYS TESTIMONY ONLY SO WE WILL BE TAKING ABOUT- BUT I DO WANT TO BE OPPORTUNE TO CLOSE. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CERTAINLY THIS IS A TOPIC AN ISSUE THAT- NEEDS MORE- VETTING AND DIALOGUE AROUND. THAT WOULD- PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE. IN THE CALIFORNIA- AND TO ENSURE THAT THAT SAFETY AND THAT PROTECTION- MISS FOLLOW THROUGH- THROUGHOUT. THE UNITED STATES IN DIFFERENT STATES THAT CHALLENGE. CALIFORNIA'S LAWS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE. THAT BALANCE THAT BALANCES STRUCTURE BRING CLOSE TO THE VICTIMS OF CRIME. VICTIMS OF CRIME. PERPETRATORS FLEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE TO EQUIP OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AFTER AND RESOLVE THOSE CRIMES AND BRING CLOSURE BACK TO THE FAMILIES. SUCH JAZZ AGAIN MISSED HIM MURDERED. NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN THAT IS HI CALIFORNIA HAS THE SEVENTH HIGHEST STATE- WITH MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE NATION. AND SO THIS BILL IS MEANT TO- EQUAL. LONG FORCE OF THE TWO TO SAW THESE. WELL AT THE SAME TIME I ACKNOWLEDGE THE- THE GREAT- CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND INDIVIDUALS COMING TO THE STATE. ARE ARE PROTECTED BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DIALOGUE IN FALL SO THAT WE CAN COME. BALANCE AND THEN BRING BACK THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT EQUIPS LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BRING CLOSURE FOR THE VICTIMS OF CRIME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ALMOST APPRECIATE IT APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION AND VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. WITH THAT. ASK MRS FRIEDMAN TO COME UP AND GET READY. AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT WITH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOMENT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR DO WE HAVE A MOTION. A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAX A SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I KILEY. OUR CAYENNE. BUYER CAN AYE BENNETT. BENNETT I BERMAN CUNNINGHAM FONG IRWIN FIVE- WHEN I VALLADARES BALLADEERS I WICKS WICKS I WILSON LISTEN HI. WITHOUT THE CONSENT COUNTERS APPROVED WE ARE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND WE ARE ALMOST HALFWAY DONE SO WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN YOU MAY FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME PRESENT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK TRIPLE A FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS- AND THEY ARE NOW TO TRY ON THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THEM EVERY YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS DIE ON THE ROAD IN TWENTY TWENTY MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED COLOR ONES LOST THEIR LIFE TO A CAR. OR ONE THOUSAND WHICH WERE PEDESTRIANS TO ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE KILLED IN TRAFFIC VIOLENCE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT ACTUALLY IN THE VEHICLE AND SPEEDING IS A FACTOR IN OVER 30% OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES XIN WIDE ACCORDING TO THE NTSB FEEDING IS A FACT SPEEDING IS A FACTOR IN WE WANT TO TACKLE TRAFFIC FATALITIES WE ALSO HAVE TO. YOU TO BE. FIRST WHICH- BROWN'S TONIGHT EIGHTY SEVEN. TO AND- DOWN. REDUCING AND REDUCE FATE. BECAUSE EVERY FEW MILES AN HOUR FASTER CARGOES THE INCREASED. RATE OF INJURIES AND. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FOURTEEN STUDIES HAVE SPEED SAFETY SYSTEMS IN CANADA. EUROPE AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND. FOUND THAT CRAP POUND CRASH REDUCTIONS OF FIVE TO SEVENTY PERCENT. INJURY REDUCTIONS OF TWELVE TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. AND FATALITY REDUCTIONS OF SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTY ONE PERCENT. AT SPEED SAFETY SYSTEMS LOCATIONS AFTER. THE SPEED CAMERA PROGRAMS WERE IMPLEMENTED. THIS IS WHY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL. AND NOW THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE U. S. CONGRESS ARE ADVOCATING. FOR STATES TO USE SPEED CAMERAS TO SAVE LIVES. NOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE OLD RED LIGHT CAMERA BILL AREN'T WE JUST WALKING DOWN THE SAME ROAD IN MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES. SO WE ARE VALUE WAITED THE RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAM TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT THEY DID WRONG. AND DESIGNED THIS BILL TO DO THE OPPOSITE. SO FOR INSTANCE WE DESIGNED THE BILL WITH BOTH PRIVACY AN EQUITY IN MIND. WE SAID THAT IT THE BILL WON'T BE PUNITIVE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE GOING AT LEAST ELEVEN MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT TO EVEN GET A TICKET. UNLIKE pREGULAR TICKETS WHICH GIVE YOU POINT. EVERS LICENSES AND THAT STARTED. SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. THESE TICKETS ARE WARNINGS FOR THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS ONLY TO PEOPLE WHO GET THE TICKETS. AND THEN AFTER THAT THEY STARTED JUST FIFTY DOLLARS AND HAVE NO POINTS AT ALL ON PEOPLE'S LICENSES. AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON. THE LINE MUST BE OFFERED EITHER AN 80% REDUCTION IN THAT FINE OR COMMUNITY SERVICE. AND A PAYMENT PLAN CAP THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THE END. FAMILIES OF FOR LESS THAN FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MUST BE OFFERED A THAT FINE STARTS AT FIFTY DOLLARS- CAMERAS ONLY TAKE PICTURES OF PEOPLE'S LICENSE PLATE. AND THE PICTURES MUST BE DESTROYED IN SIXTY DAYS UNDER THIS BILL. AND UNLIKE A- PRC INFORMATION CAN ONLY BE USED TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS AND NOT ANY OTHER VIOLATIONS. AND IT ALSO PROTECTS RESIDENTS FROM USING THESE CAMERAS FROM CITIES WHO WANT TO PAD THEIR GENERAL FUND. AND WE DESIGNED THE BILL SAYING THAT THAT MONEY CANNOT GO TO CITIES GENERAL FUND THE REVENUES MUST GO RIGHT BACK INTO THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO IMPROVE SAFETY CONDITIONS IN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO IT'S REALLY MEANT TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND LASTLY TO SHOW THAT WE'RE NOT ABOUT THE MONEY. IF THE SPEEDING IN THE AREA DOES NOT GO DOWN IN OTHER WORDS IF THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS THE CAMERA GENERATES DOES NOT GO DOWN. THE CAMERA MUST BE REMOVED. SO AGAIN THESE ARE CLEARLY USED AS A TOOL. AND YOU HAVE TO WARN PEOPLE BEFORE THEY EVEN COME TO THE CAMERA AND WE HAVE TO TELL DRIVERS THAT THEY'RE COMING INTO AN AREA WHERE SPEED ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS USING BECAUSE AGAIN. THE GOAL IS NOT TO ISSUE A LOT OF TICKETS IS TO SLOW AT THE DRIVERS DOWN. NOW THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM IN ONLY SIX CITIES IN THE STATE. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS THE MAYOR OF ONE OF THE CITY'S THAT'S ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TRYING THIS TOOL. LISA MIDDLETON FROM THE CITY OF PALM SPRINGS AND THEN AFTER HER WE WILL HAVE PASTOR PATRICIA STRONG WITH FEES PAID FOR LA STREETS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU.

AND MY SMALL CITY LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN THE LAST FIFTY ONE MONTHS FORTY NINE PEOPLE. HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO TRAFFIC FATALITIES. MANY OF THOSE PEDESTRIANS. MOST OF THOSE AS A RESULT OF SPEEDING. EITHER OF THE- DRIVERS SPEEDING AND- LOSING CONTROL OR A PEDESTRIAN OR SOMEONE ELSE DOING SOMETHING. THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DO AND A DRIVER DOING. DRIVING TOO FAST TO BE ABLE. TO STOP IN TO AVOID. HITTING THE AN INDIVIDUAL AND CAUSING A FATALITY. WE HAVE. AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FROM RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT OUR CITY WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT- TWO WEEKS AGO TO CELEBRATE- AB FORTY THREE AND LOWERING THE SPEED LIMITS ON THIRTY SIX SEGMENTS BUT WHAT WAS SAID TO.

CREAMER MATTER FROM ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION. THANK YOU BACK A KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO INCLUDE PRIVACY IN EQUITY PROVISIONS UNFORTUNATELY THOSE IN THE BILL DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS. AUTOMATED TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS REYES NUMEROUS PRIVACY CONCERNS. BY ENCOURAGING THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SPEED LIMITS AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX SUBJECTS CALIFORNIANS TO INCREASE SURVEILLANCE AND PERPETUATES THE FALSE NOTION. SURVEILLANCE BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SURVEILLED. SALEM CAN BE EASILY MISUSED LEADING TO THE EROSION OF COMMUNITY TRUST AND COSTLY LAWSUITS AS WELL AS DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES AND THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES. THEY NEED FOR REDUCING SPEED RELATED TRAFFIC COLLISIONS DOES NOT WARRANT THE CREATION OF THE NEW MECHANISM FOR GOVERNMENT COLLECTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA ON CALIFORNIANS. THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF REDUCING SPEED BASED TRAFFIC COLLISIONS THAT DO NOT IMPLICATE PRIVACY IN EQUITY. PUTTING THOSE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE BILL ITSELF ROUND ABOUT SPEED HUMPS OR SPEED TABLES TRAFFIC CIRCLES AND OTHER TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES. YET RATHER THAN CENTER THESE THE BALANCED RELY ON SURVEILLANCE THE MADE IN THIS MATTER AN INCREASED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES COST MONEY HOWEVER AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX ALSO OF COST. INSTEAD OF CITIES AND COUNTIES PAYING THE BILL AB. TWENTY THIRTY. FIRST OF ALL. FOR THE TERM INCREASE TICKET THE AB TWENTY THIRTY FRIGHTENS WOULD GO AGAINST RECENT ROUGH TO CALIFORNIA'S TICKETING LAWS TO REDUCE THE WELL DOCUMENTED ECONOMIC HARMS CAUSED BY MASS TICKETING PARTICULARLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WOMEN OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK IN MY NEXT WOMEN ARE ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO SUFFER UNDER ABTWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE COSTS OF CITATIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY INCURRED THE CITATIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GROWING NUMBER FIFTY FIVE THAT'S FIVE FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU TOWARDS THE BURKE FROM OPEN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CHAIR OF MY QUESTIONS FOR THE WITNESS IN IN IN OPPOSITION- YOU POINTED OUT THAT BOTH THE CAMERAS HAVE A COST IN THE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU REFER TO AS A SOLUTION A PROBLEM HAVE A COST. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS ARE MUCH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE PUTTING IN MORE ROUNDABOUTS ETCETERA- THEN THE VICTIM THE CAMERA- SET UP- AND I. WE HAVE TO TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH- ROAD IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE COULD MAKE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SPEEDING. IT TEARS UP TO THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF PEDESTRIAN DEATHS. BUT REALLY IS- I WOULD LOVE TO GET AN ANSWER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY YOUR CALL IS A LEGISLATOR YOU GOT TO DETERMINE HOW WE SPEND MONEY AS A STATE JUST LIKE THE LOCAL- ELECTED WOULD HAVE DETERMINATION OVER HOW THEY SPEND MONEY IN THEIR BUDGET. AND SO IT'S REALLY IT'S NOT MY CALL TO MAKE OF WHETHER WE INVEST ENOUGH BUT I DO THINK THAT. IF THE- COMMITMENT WAS THERE TO INVEST THE MONEY THAT YES IT IS POSSIBLE. TO BUILD THE ROADS AND IMPROVE THE ROADS SAID THAT SPEEDING IS NOT THERE BUT IT WOULD BE MISSED. SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN DEATHS. AFTER AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION FOR YOU YOUR- ORIGINAL STATEMENT WAS. OF THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DON'T JUST. HEY THIS. IN A PRIVACY- THE THAT YOU SEE WITH THIS AND- IS THERE A LEVEL OF DEBT NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT DOES JUSTIFY. THE THAT INVASION. WHAT WOULD IT BE IS- IS IT IF IT WAS FIVE TIMES WORSE WITH THAT JUSTIFY. THAT WAS NOT ACTUALLY WHAT MY STATEMENT WAS MY STATEMENT WAS THAT THERE ARE OTHER METHODS TO GET TO THE POINT OF REDUCING DEATHS. THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME PRIVACY AND EQUITY CONCERNS AND THAT THOSE ARE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD BE PURSUING THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANNA AND COMMEND THE ALL FOR HARD WORK ON THIS I THINK YOU CAN SEE IN THE LEGISLATION THAT SHE HAS SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ENERGY MAKING SURE BELL A NARROW IN ITS SCOPE BASED ON COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT TARGETING THAT MAKES THAT ARE AT SO I GUESS GIVEN THE HARD WORK SHE'S DONE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY COULD SUPPORT IT- YOU ARE BALANCING THE PRIVACY INTEREST WITH I WAS BEING SAVED- I'M CURIOUS WHAT. WHAT WOULD GET YOU TO THAT POINT OR NOTHING I MEAN YOU JUST AGAINST ALL CAMERAS. I'M WE WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST NEED TO SEE IF OTHER METHODS EXPLORED THAT ARE NOT INCREASING SURVEILLANCE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SURVEILLANCE COMES WITH ITS OWN SITE IS STILL VERY POPULAR TRYING. WHAT IS OUT THERE DOING A GREAT. GOING OVER YOUR- YEAH- BUT THAT THEY SURVEILLANCE COME WITH ITS OWN AND COSTS AS WELL. AS SO SHE NOT BE THE FIRST PROPOSED SOLUTION THE OTHER SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE EXAMINED ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER VERY CLEAR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THANK YOU ONE I KNOW IS CHAIR OF THIS POSITION COMMITTEE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY FOCUSED ON IN THIS ISN'T THE ONLY MEANS SHE HAS USED TO REDUCE DEATHS AND PROTECT LIVES AND COMMUNITIES- AND SO I THINK THIS IS A COMMITTEE HAVING SAT ON IT FOR YEARS. IT REALLY DOES VALUE THE PRIVACY OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND AS I YOU KNOW LOOK AT THIS BILL AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAW THE WAY IN WHICH SHE NARROWED THE RETENTION OF THE DATA THE DATA THAT WAS BEING- I THINK SHE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN NARROWING- THE PRIVACY THAT IS BEING GIVEN UP HERE TO SAVE LIVES AND SO I REALLY WOULD URGE THE ACLU THAT IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PROTECT THE PRIVACY TO BRING THAT TO THE SOME AMERICANS I THINK HER. INTEREST IN DOING SO. IN THE CLEAR IN THE- NATION STANDS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. INTEREST BUT THE INTEREST AS SAWYER BENNETT POINTED OUT OF SAVING LIVES IS PARAMOUNT AND SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU I THINK WE HAD A ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT OURS. THANK YOU- SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT THIS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS GREAT NO OTHER MAMA FIVE YEAR OLDS- WHO WILL NOT ALLOW HER TO PLAY ON THE STREET OR WRITE HER BACK ON THE STREET. I'M SORRY RIGHT. BOB UP. CHILDREN ON BIKES THEY COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT THE INTENT. IT REMINDS ME A LITTLE BIT OF THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS THAT WERE ONCE INSTALLED IN THE CITY OF COULD- AND THE CITY OVER THE YEARS COLLECTED DATA AND WHICH WOULD SAY THAT THERE WAS A DECREASE IN COLLISIONS. THERE WERE ALSO INCREASING. AT ABOUT. PERCENT. THERE WAS. A LOT OF CAN CAN RIGHT. CAN RATHER CHRIS. THAT WORK- IN THE MAIL- FOR THEIR CARS BUT THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY DRIVING- WITH THE CITY ULTIMATELY- PULLED OUT ALL THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS BUT I AM. A LITTLE WORRIED THATYOUR BILL DOES LIMIT THE DUE PROCESS- AND IN SPECIFICALLY. WITH TYPICAL SPEEDING TICKETS. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BUT WE SPEAK BOTH I'M SORRY UNLIKE WITH THE TYPICAL SPEEDING TICKET. SPEED CAMERA VIOLATORS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO A COURT HEARING IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THIS LANGUAGE AND THEY CAN REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING BUT AFTER THEY PAID THE FULL PENALTY THE TICKET ALSO DOESN'T HAVE THE- DATA IN WHICH- INFORMATION ON HOW FAST THEY WERE GOING NOW IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO GET. WITH WE CAN TAKE IT WHEN YOU'RE GOING FIFTIES FIFTY FIVE VERSUS EIGHTY AND FIFTY FIVE- SO IT JUST CONCERNS ME THAT AND I FEEL LIKE THERE COULD BE SOME MORE WORK IN THIS AREA TO ENSURE THAT OUR CITIZENS HAVE. PROCESS THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IF YOU. DUG INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT DON'T NEED TO WRITE. VISIT. CONCERT. THIS AMERICAN HIM. YEAH I JUST WANNA TO. FOR THE WITNESS OPPOSITION- YOU KEEP USING THE TERM PRIVACY INVASION OR SOMETHING CORRECT ME IF I MISQUOTED YOU- BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT TECHNICALLY OR LEGALLY YOU'RE REFERRING TO BUT THATIS AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL HE CAN'T USE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE.% PASSAT THAT RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S BUT I THINK IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT THING THE DATA THAT'S RETAIN HAS TO BE EXPUNGED ENTIRELY WITHIN CERTAIN DOESN'T IN TIME PERIOD HAS LIKE FIVE DAYS IF THEY DON'T ISSUE A TICKET. RIGHT SO THERE'S NO. READ THE GOVERNMENT OLLECTING DATA THAT STORY INDEFINITELY. AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL RIGHT. AND WE AND YOU DON'T GENERALLY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY INTEREST IN. THE MAKE MODEL COLOR OF YOUR VEHICLE AND YOUR VEHICLE LICENSE PLATE BECAUSE YOU DRIVE AROUND AND EVERYWHERE ANYBODY WANTS COULD TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU DRIVING IN THE CAR THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH TO DO ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT WHERE IS THE INVASION OF PRIVACY IS YOU GUYS SEE IT COMING FROM WHAT WHAT I'M WHAT AM I MISSING HERE. YES SO AND JUST HAVE IT FOR US PRIVACY IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS BUT IT IS ALSO NOT THE SOLE CONCERN I KNOWS THE- PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE ALSO HAVE. TO PROCESS AN EQUITY CONCERNS AS WELL OUR PRIVACY CONCERNS THERE ARE SEVERAL SO ONE IS. ANYTIME THAT YOU'RE INCREASING SURVEILLANCE YOU THAT IS. THEY CALL THE IMPACTS PRIVACY AND PROBLEMATIC WAYS THESE CAMERAS WILL ALSO NOT JUST BE CAPTURING. YOUR LICENSE PLATE INFORMATION BUT ALSO. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE TIED TO THAT. SPECIFIC CAMERA IT'S GOING TO BE TRACKING YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION AS WELL. OF WHERE YOU WERE AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME- AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THESE CAMERAS ARE SET UP THAT COULD REVEAL VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU BUT AT THE VERY LEAST COULD REVEAL. YOUR TRAVEL AND FOR ME. THAT EVENT PERSONAL INFORMATION- SO THERE IS A LOT WE ALSO OFTENTIMES SEE THAT NO MATTER HOW TIGHTLY THE PROTECTIONS ARE. THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE TO TRY AND PROTECT DATA THAT DATA IS FREQUENTLY STILL. USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND SHARED AND APPROPRIATELY AND WE CAUGHT MISSION CREEP AND THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN HERE THAT WE HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES WHERE THERE ARE STRICT. REQUIREMENTS ON WHEN INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED IN WHEN IT CAN'T GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS BELL THAT WAS UP IN COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE ON ALE PR INFORMATION THE LAW IS REALLY CLEAR OF IT CALIFORNIA AGENCIES CANNOT SHARE ALE PR INFORMATION OUT OF STATE. OR WITH THE FEDS AND YET WE'VE SEEN MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DOING THAT JUST THAT I MEAN ACLU AND ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION FOR EXAMPLE ARE CURRENTLY LITIGATING. WITH MARIN COUNTY SHERIFF OVER THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO SEE IT AS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS AND I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS PUT IN SOME REALLY IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS WE STILL SEE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS HAPPENING DESPITE SOME OF THOSE- PROTECTIONS AND SO IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE IMPACTS THE IMPACTS NOT JUST THE INTENDED IMPACTS OF THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU CHAIRS AND DOGS I DON'T WANT FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR YOU CAN ADDRESS YOUR CLOTHES. ON THE- THE APPEAL PROCESS OR DUE PROCESS AND- IT'S THE IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT HAPPENS IN A SITUATION WHERE A LADY SAY I LET MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BORROW MY CAR. AND SHE'S DOING TWELVE MILES AN HOUR OVER THE POSTED LIMIT GET TWENTY TICKETS- YOUR HOUSE THAT SORTED OUT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ANSWER SO THINK OF THIS BECAUSE SHE'S PAYING THAT THAT RIGHT RIGHT. I DON'T THINK OF THIS THINK OF THIS THIS THINK OF THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE- TICKET. WHERE AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU GETTING A TICKET THIS IS ABOUT THE VEHICLE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO POINTS ON THE LICENSE PLATE THAT'S WHY IT'S A NOMINAL TICKET FEE. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE CAR ENGAGING IN A MOVING VIOLATION THE SAME WAY A CAR GAUGING AND APART WE DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU PARK THE CAR THERE YOU THAT TALKING ABOUT DEFENSE IN COURT WHEN YOU COME IN YOU SAY MY DAUGHTER PARK THE CAR IN THE RED ZONE. PARK UP TICKET. UP VERY SIMILAR UP WAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN- SO WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT THE DUE PROCESS IN THIS- BUT- IT WAS STRUCTURED VERY SIMILAR TO. WHAT WHAT ANY CAR THAT MADE A VIOLATION. YOU KNOW THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF A DRIVER'S VIOLATIONS NOT A MOVING VIOLATION ON THE DRIVER IT'S- IT'S A CAR DOING OF- HAVING A VIOLATION JUST LIKE A PARKING pWHO'S DRIVING YOUR CAR AT THE MOMENT THE TICKETS ISSUED YOU WILL BE ABLE TO. EXACT REVENGE ON I HAVE A TICKET THE FAMILY MEMBER OPEN THOSE DRIVE MY CAR. YEAH OKAY SO AND I DON'T MEAN TO GO OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF PRIVACY BUT I. MEANT TO ASK SINCE. RITESH YEP. SO IT UNDER NO SIR. BUILD THE YOU CAN. GET A POINT ON THEIR DRIVING RECORD. ABSOLUTE CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU NO POINTS. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER. HELP MISTER BENNETT PLEASE. JUST JUST VERY QUICKLY COULD JUST THIS BILL IS THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO AND I APPRECIATE BUT JUST. FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY AND JUST WHAT I'M HEARING BASICALLY AND I'M HEARING IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER IF THIS IS A CAMERA THAT TAKES A PICTURE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME OPPOSITION THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. FROM THE OPPOSITION AND I GUESS IF YOU TOOK THAT LOGIC TO A TO EXTREME THEN YOU WOULD A WEEK. CAN TAKE A- JENNIFER SWEAR YOUR V. WAS AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME- AND WITH THAT- I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AS I WILL BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BENNETT ARE THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISH ASK QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CHECK ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER WAX AND A SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT. WITH THAT. MISPRONOUNCING QUEUE FOR THE TIME ATTENTION YOU PUT INTO THE SPELL- IN WHERE THE COMMITTEE OF SECOND REFERRAL SO WE'RE PRIMARILY. CHARGED WITH VIOLATING THE PRIVACY IMPACT SHE JUST. A COMPLIMENTARY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BARRICADED DID FOR BEING MINDFUL OF PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY DOING ITS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU PUT TIME AND ATTENTION AND EFFORT INTO THINKING ABOUT. HOW DO YOU ADVANCE THE- THE SPEED SAFETY ISSUES THAT I KNOW YOU ARE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT AND TESTIFIED ABOUT WITH SOME ENTHUSIASM. BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT. THE UNITED. YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF ANY HERE THAT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE TRY TO SLIDE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE BUT TO ME. THERE ARE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO THIS BILL. YOU KNOW POTENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE- YOU'VE CLEARLY. AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW PUT IN SOME PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS. RELATED TO THE VIDEO GENERATED BY THE SYSTEM THE DELETION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DATA COLLECTED. ALL THE VENDORS TO THE SAME COMMONSENSE I JUST WANT TO. APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES I KNOW ARE OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE SPOKE- YOU KNOW EXPECT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH STEAK. ON SOME OF THOSE WERE ISSUED ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR PURVIEW. BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK. FOR YOU STOP IN FOR WORKING WITH US TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE- YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. WITH THAT BECAUSE- THANK YOU TO WE'VE SEEN IN ALMOST 30% INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THIS IS SUCH A PROBLEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT NOW SPEED CAMERAS ARE CALLED OUT AS BEING ELIGIBLE. FOR FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER THE BI. INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOB ACT. AS PART OF A NATIONWIDE GOAL OF REDUCING TRAFFIC FATALITIES. TO ZERO SIXTEEN OTHER STATES ALLOW FOR THE USE OF CAMERAS AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOT ABOUT IF WE DO. IT WE SET THE STANDARD FOR A MORE THOUGHTFUL- MORE EQUITABLE MORE PRIVACY CENTERED- WAY OF INITIATING THESE. CAN ALL YOU LOCATE WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE A SPEEDING PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO BE GOING. AWAY SEVEN MILE HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT. WE'VE TRIED TO TAKE THIS THEY CAN'T I'D LIKE CAMERA BILL IN A- WAY LOOKING. TO WORK WITH STICKLES DO IT AT IT'S NOT IN A VACUUM. WE ALSO WERE ON FUNDING FOR THOSE OTHER- SAFETY IMPROVE.

TWENTY THE WOMAN IN THE MAKE. HE HAS A PLAN TO MAKE. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE- OUR BY PART OF DUO- SOME AND SUMMER HIM YOU MAY BE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WANT TO- I LIKE TO BEGIN BACK THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS LISTED AND ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. AND THE HARDWORKING COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO FOR THEIR LINE THIS BILL TO CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING PRIVACY LAWS. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE AS AMENDED WILL ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE. TO HELP CREATE A SAFER ONLINE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CHILDREN. WELL EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY STATUTES OFFER IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS THAT GUARD CHILDREN'S PRIVACY THERE IS NO COHERENT COMPREHENSIVE LAW THAT PROTECTS CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN. FROM ONLINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO ACCESS. AS A RESULT ONLINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE KIDS USE DAILY HAVE BEEN LOADED ITH ADULT DESIGN PRINCIPLES THEY DO NOT FACTOR IN THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUNG MINDS ABILITIES AND SENSIBILITIES. BY NOT CONSIDERING CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN THE DESIGN OF ONLINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO ACCESS. THEY FACE A NUMBER OF ADVERSE IMPACTS TO THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE ONLINE WORLD INCLUDING BULLYING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR. AS AMENDED AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING WEBSITES AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED BY CHILDREN. TO OFFER PRIVACY AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS BY DEFAULT. UNLESS THERE'S REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT THE CONSUMER IS AN ADULT. IS PROTECTIONS INCLUDE DISABLING PROFILING. PROHIBITING THE COLLECTION OR RETENTION OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE REQUESTED. OR USING A CHILD'S PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN THE REASON FOR WHICH IT WAS COLLECTED. PROHIBITING THE COLLECTION OF ANY PRECISE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION BY DEFAULT UNLESS THE BUSINESS CAN DEMONSTRATE A COMPELLING REASON THAT DOING. SO BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. PROHIBITING THE USE DARK. I EVEN IF LITTLE DESIGN TO LEAD OR ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO HER PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION BEYOND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED SERVICE. FOR TRICO PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY WHICH IS THE PRIVACY AGENCY WE DOUBLES IN CALIFORNIA. TO SABOTAGING CONVENE THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S DATA PROTECTION TASK FORCE TO EVALUATE BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE DESIGN CODE AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO BUSINESSES AS SPECIFIED IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE BILL I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD. IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS- AND I THINK HAVING THAT TOP FORCE WORKING WITH THE REGULATORY AGENCY TO. WITH THE OWNERS ARE LIMITATION IS KEY. FINALLY AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE THE PRIVACY AGENCY IN CONSULTATION THE TASK FORCE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PUT A- IT IS A CO. PAY FIRST TWENTY FOUR WE KNOW A BIT. OF THE LONG RUN WIFE TIMING BUT THOUGHT THAT THAT IMPORTANT JUST ENTER OF GETTING RIGHT IN WE NEED THE TIME TO BE ABLE. SEVENTY THREE ISN'T STEP TOWARDS ADDRESS THE WE CAN TO FACE. AND ENSURING THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SAFE WHEN THEYGO ONLINE WITH THE AMENDMENTS I'M TAKING TODAY SORRY WHILE HE AMENDMENTS I'VE TAKEN A JOB DRESS ALL THE CONCERNS. RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK I'M SURE THIS BILL MOVES. THAT HAD MANY MEETINGS WITH THE TECH INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TO CREATE A BILL THAT. AND WE THINK IT CAN WORK FOR THEM- I WILL HAVE MY WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCED AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE- WITH THE TERMS AND DOLLARS TO ALLOW MY TURN AUTHOR JUST A COUPLE WORDS AS WELL. POSSIBLE TO SAY NOW. THEN I'LL BE FAIRLY BREF I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE- THE INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION TO. THE CURRENT GENERATION OF KIDS AND ALL THE GENERATIONS THAT ARE. TO COME THE DIGITAL WORLD THE ONLINE WORLDWHATEVER. NAME IT GOES BY IS. INTEGRAL TO THEIR LIVES AND HOW THEY COMMUNICATE AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH SOME PEOPLE THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE INTERACTING WITH. AND THERE IS NOT A PARENT. I WOULD. BET MY OUSTER IS NOT APPARENT ON THIS PLANET. THAT RULE. THE CAPABILITY OF. GETTING ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT THE- KIDS ARE ABLE TO GET ALL THE THINGS THAT. PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO. THAT HAVE NO GOOD INTENTION AT ALL. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT MARKETING PRODUCTS. I'M TALKING ABOUT OTHER NEFARIOUS NEFARIOUS THINGS. DRAWN SOME OF MY- PRIOR EXPERIENCES DEPUTY DA I REMEMBER GOING TO A CONFERENCE WIN. AT THIS IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND THEY WERE USING GEOLOCATION TO TRY TO FIND KIDS THAT. PARKS ADOPTION. PROCESS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. A LONG TIME NOT THE FAULT OF THE COME. AND TERMS BETTER WE HAVE TO DO IT IN TO MAKES THAT ARE KEY THEY'RE NOT WE'RE TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON TECHNOLOGY AND THIS IS PART OF IT I MEAN MY TEENAGERS THEY'D TARGET OTHER OVER VIDEO GAMES THAT TALK TO EACH OTHER ON SNAPCHAT THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY WATCH TICTOC VIDEOS AND IT IS PART OF THE THAT'S- TO MAKE- GOING TOWARD THE- IT'S- SUPPORT JUST WANT AND HAVE AN AWESOME WHAT IS YOUR WHO LED THE CHARGE TO IMPLEMENT THIS THE BILL WATER IN THE U. K. THAT THIS IS PATTERNED OFF OF. IS MY AND TWENTY TO PRINT A POTENTIAL ARGUE YOU MIGHT HEAR IT IS WORKING THERE THE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COMPLYING WITH THIS IT IS ALL RIGHT LED TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE KEEPING OUR KIDS SAFE KEEPING THE KIDS IN THE UK SAFER AND WE NEED TO CALIFORNIA WE NEED IN AMERICA SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO OUR- PRIMARY. WITNESS IT'S A- AND WE HAVE A- S. B. B. Q. DRAWN FOR THE FIVE RIGHTS FOUNDATION BARONESS IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN WELCOME BACK. AT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH JAFFA HAVING ME BACK AM I AM BARONESS THE BANK IS DRAWN ON THE CROSS PEER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE ARCHITECT. AT U. K. H. PRO. DESIGN CODE AND I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THAT WAS A BIPARTISAN. M. INTERVENTION ALSO AND I SUCH AS AN INDEPENDENT PAN. AM ASSET NOT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WICKS THERE ARE THREE. PRIMARY PRINCIPLES AT OF THE BILL AND IT THAT IT REALLY NEW TO THE AREA OF ONLINE REGULATION THE FIRST IS THAT IT DEFINES A CHILD AS A PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN WHICH DOES AWAY WITH THE IDEA OF ADULTHOOD AT SEVENTEEN WHICH IS THE NORM CURRENTLY. ONLINE IS ALSO SUPPORTS CHILDREN ONLINE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SPEND THAT TIME BY EXPECT EXTENDING THE SCOPE. FROM DIRECTED AT CHILDREN TO SERVICES LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED BY CHILDREN AND IT'S FOCUSED ON DESIGN NOT REQUIRING COMPLEX ACTIONS FROM YOUNG USES THIS IS A PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARDS PRODUCT SAFETY RATHER THAN TRYING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AFTER HOME HAS ALREADY BEEN PERRANCE BY CHILDREN. I PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE. AS AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM HAS ALLUDED TO IS THAT WHILE THIS IS A NEW APPROACH IT IS ALREADY INTERNAL AND THE U. K. AND THE RESULTS OF WHICH HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST INNOVATION AND DESIGNING FOR CHILD SAFETY THAT THAT TAX HIKES SET TO. HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN GOOGLE DEFAULTS TO SAVE SUCH FOR UNDER EIGHTEENS YOU TRIP TURNED OFF AUTOPLAY TICTOC AN INSTAGRAM STOP DIRECT MESSAGING OF UNKNOWN ADULTS TO MINUS AMONG HUNDREDS OF THE INCREMENTAL CHANGES THAT DETOXIFY THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. I AM PRO TECH BUT JUST AS ONE CANNOT OR SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SELL RANCHO DRIVE A CAR WITH NO SEAT BELTS REVIEW MIRACLE HEADLINES. IT MUST NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL RENTAL OFFER A CHILD SERVICES AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE NOT TAKEN ACCOUNT OF THAT PRIVACY AND SAFETY. THE CALIFORNIA AGE APPROPRIATE DESIGN BILL SIMPLY AND SHOWS THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY IF. THE END USER WAS A CHILD. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE OFFICE OF WORKED AT WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT LANGUAGES CLARIFIED AND ALIGNED WITH THE C. P. R. A. M. BUT IF CALIFORNIA DOES PULSE AB TWO TWO SEVEN THREE. IT WILL I BELIEVE IN TIME BECOME A GLOBAL NORM THAT WILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGACY FOR THE STATE. CON MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE. MOST AND- THE WELLBEING OF THE BILLION CHILDREN WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY NICE FURNACE AND WE NOW SECOND. PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY KIM WHO IS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FROM PORTER RANCH CALIFORNIA FROM AND ABOUT. THAT FOR GOLF WELCOME TO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU CHAIRED YOU COME. I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF MY NAME IS EMMA AND CAM I AM EIGHTEEN YEAR FROM POOR RANCH. AND I WANT TO TALK MY STORY ON TECH PLATFORMS AND HOW THEY COULD AND SHOULD HAVE STEPPED UP TO PREVENT THE MANY ISSUES I EXPERIENCED. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY AS A RESULT SUCH PLATFORMS AND MANY PROBLEMS HAVE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT. THIS IS WHY I'M CALLING FOR LEGISLATION TO ENSURE SOCIAL MEDIA CORPORATIONS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE LACK OF PRECAUTION AND SAFETY MEASURES. I GOT MY FIRST CELLPHONE AFTER I TURNED THIRTEEN ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS DONAL INSTAGRAM SO THAT COULD FIT IN. MANY OF MY CLASSMATES ALREADY HAD ACCOUNTS AS I SCROLL DOWN LOOKING AT MY PEERS IS PROFILED I FOUND MYSELF STARING AT MY OWN IMAGE. READING LIST TENS CALLING ME FAT AND UGLY WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE MY FRIENDS HAVE UPLOADED PHOTOS ME RIDICULING EVERY ASPECT MY BODY. AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN I DID NOT USE THE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BLOCK OR FLAG CONTENT. PLATFORMS DO NOT GIVE USERS CREEK SUCTION SO YOU DON'T GET A BREAK DOWN WE WANT SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IT FELT LIKE A GAME WITH THE GOAL OF HIGH ALERT ONS AND BIKE NOW. AND COMMENTS WHEN YOU DON'T GET HIGH ENGAGEMENT YOU THINK YOU MUST BE MISS UNDERSTANDING THE GAME ARE NOT PLAYING RIGHT. YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THE COMPANY HAT MADE THE GAME AND IN THIS GAME IT WAS- WHAT'S SOMETHING WENT WRONG. MY MIND TORMENT YOU CAN SEE. ONE AFTER I WAS. WITHOUT AREATA AND LOSS. CLASSMATES SUPPOSED OF THEM. PARTICIPATE IN TOWN TRENDS THAT I. COULD NOT PART. IN THIS IS ALSO THE TIME INSTAGRAM STORIES CAME OUT WHENSOMEBODY UPLOADED A NEW STORY THERE WOULD BE A PUSH NOTIFICATION. I GET NOTIFICATIONS THAT ONE OF MY CLASSMATES OR FRIENDS HAD A NEW STORY. I CLICK ON THE NOTIFICATION AND BE SHOWN YET ANOTHER PHOTO. THAT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I COULDN'T FIT IN. I'D LIKE AND COMMENT ON THE POST MADE BY MY CLASSMATES BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I HAD TO. AND THEN BECAUSE I INTERACTED WITH THAT POST I GET MORE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE KINDS OF POSTS. I KEPT GETTING NOTIFICATIONS SCREAMING FOR MY ATTENTION REMINDING ME OF WHO I CANNOT BE. DESPITE NOT POSTING PHOTOS OF MYSELF I STOP AT HORRIBLE WHENEVER I WAS. UPSET MEDIA PLATFORM SO I DELETED THE APPS OFF MY PHONE. BUT I STARTED BEING EXCLUDED FROM CONVERSATIONS AT SCHOOL. I WAS MEASURING MYSELF UP TO ALL OF MY PEERS ON THESE PLATFORMS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS LOSING. MY KNOW. THE DESIGN PURGING PEOPLE GO. BACK TO THE TOP SO COMPARISON. AND THEY KNOW WHAT. PEOPLE AS A DID ME. IT MAKES ME. DIZZY AS IF NOT WELCOME ARE NOT NEEDED. AND TO THINK THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FEATURE ON THESE PLATFORMS IS SICKENING. THIS WASN'T SOMETHING I COULD TALK TO MY PARENTS ABOUT. DIDIT HAVE ANY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES ON SOCIAL MEDIA GROWING UP SO THEY DID NOT CATCH ME WHEN I FELL. I FOUND MYSELF IN A POSITION WITH NO SUPPORT. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP ME. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FACILITATE THIS HARM AND THEY REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON MY GRADES MY MENTAL AND MY PHYSICAL HEALTH MY ATTENTION WAS ON OTHER GIRLS ON THE INTERNET. I FIXATED ON TRYING TO BE LIKE THEM. I HATED BEING ME. IT WAS NO LONGER ABOUT FITTING IN WITH MY CLASSMATES IT WAS A PLEASING SOMEONE. AND HE- IT WASN'T UNTIL THE POPE NINETEEN KNOCKED DOWN THAT I LEARNED ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND DIGITAL ON THIS ADVOCACY SHORTLY AFTER DISCOVERING THE LOG OFF MOVEMENT I BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF THE LGBTQ PLUS INITIATIVE I WORK HARD TO INFORM AND PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY MY LGBTQ PLUS PEERS ON THE HARMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND HOW TO USE IT SAFELY I AM SO SORRY WE NEED YOU TO WRAP UP. I GENUINE I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE RISE OF THE STUDENT LED MOVEMENTS LIKE THE LOG OFF MOVEMENT TECHNICALLY POLITICS. PROVE HOW BADLY LEGISLATION NEEDS TO BE PASSED IN ORDER PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE GROWING. MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TEAMS LIKE MYSELF ARE BEING HARMED AND WE WANT TO SPEAK UP AND TELL OUR STORIES BUT THE HARSH REALITY IS THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN DO. TEAMS DO NOT HOLDING GOVERNMENT. SO I ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS HARMED AND SCARED IF USERS. ASK FOR HELP IN THE FIGHT TO MAKE THE DIGITAL SAFER THROUGH LEGISLATION. AND PROTECT THE NEXT GENERATION THANK YOU SO MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU.

HI MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME CONCERN. FOR THE BILL ITSELF BUT WE VERY MUCH AGREE INTO CARE ITS LEAD TO HEIGHTENED PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS THAT EXISTS FOR CHILDREN. THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS I WANT TO EXPAND ON FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO PAY FOR IT WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND VULNERABILITIE OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MINOR ARE NOT THE SAME AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHILD. TO OUR CONCERN AT THE BILLION. ALL MY INTO THE SAME AGE GROUP ABOUT DIFFERENT AND WE SIMPLY AFTER THE IN ARE AND YOU CAN RETURNS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IS THAT RIGHT TO THE FROM. ARRAY THE MAP PUBLIC POLICY SECOND WE APPRECIATE THEM AND BEING TAKEN TO THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TASK FORCE THAT WE SUGGEST THAT UPON COMPLETION OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES THE TASK FORCE TO BE REQUIRED TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED FROM THERE APPLICATIONS RESPECTFULLY REMAIN OPPOSED BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORK WITH DOCTORS.

WE HAVE ONE LINE WITH AN OPERATOR IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. PUBLIC COMMENT COMES FROM LINE FIFTY NINE. NINE FIFTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AFTERNOON THAT THE TEMPLATE ON BEHALF OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE ON OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF OUR- TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS ON THIS BILL. THERE ARE NO FURTHER ALLIANCE IN QUEUE FOR A POSITION AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITHOUT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. REMEMBER FIGHT ARE. I'M FIRST OF ALL EMILY I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR BEING A VOICE FOR YOUR GENERATION- I AM SO PROUD TO REPRESENT YOU YOUR BRAVE YOU ARE COURAGEOUS- AND YOUR- THE WAY THAT. OUR I CAN APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE- FOR YOUR GENERATION THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I'M I'M HOPING YOU CAN EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON WHY THE NEED FOR THE LANGUAGE LIKELY. ACCESS VERSES A MOST LIKELY- WHY LET IF THE CHAIR ALLOWS- THE BARONESS TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE I THANK GOD FOR THIS IN THE UK YEAH- ABSOLUTELY AND IF I MIGHT AT ECHO YOU WITH AND I'M- LIKELY TO BE ACTS I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY CAÑADA ABOUT DIRECT TRIP FROM THE I'M NOT ALWAYS WHEN YOU WISH THEM TO BE AND AT LOOK SENATE YOU CAN. WE LOOKED AT THE WAY CHILDREN REALLY WANNA DID NOT WANT TO BRING IN SOMETHING THAT MAKE SESAME STREET BATCH TO BATCH BUT LEFT TECH TALK FACEBOOK AS WELL AS SCOPE SATELLITE THE ACCESS IS DEFINED AT BY YOUR- PERCENT WHICH MIGHT. NAY RESEARCH BY DONALD WAS. A BY A- IF YOU WANT. AT OF THE S. THAT HAVE BEEN THAT SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN AND INDEED IF YOU YOUR FORMAT SO IF YOUR IN A- CARTOON OR SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW CHILDREN LIKE. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THIS POINT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERVICES ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED ON THAT DEFINITION AT. MOM AND POP. GET OUT OF WEBSITES B. TWO B. AT THINGS THAT OF FRACTALS SPECIFICALLY SO IT WILL BE JUST SAYS. WE TAKE THE PROTECTIONS WHETHER CHILDREN ARE ON THE LINE IS THERE A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS EXPLAINED AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LIKELY VERSUS THE MOST LIKELY LANGUAGE. HOW THAT WOULD BE APPLIED. THANK YOU- IN IN OUR DEFENDING OF YOU KNOW- DIRECTED TO CHILDREN THAT WOULD BE. AND ARE. LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED BY CHILDREN WOULD BE AN OVER INCREASE IN STANDARD IT WOULD CAPTURE FAR MORE WEBSITES AND PLATFORMS- AND SUBJECT THEM TO THE BOULDER CARMEN- WHICH- AS NOTED ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET AND IMPLEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE. CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN WEBSITES SUCH AS ONLINE NEWS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE ACCESSED BY USERS OF ALL AGES AND DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE VISITORS. TO REGISTER IN ORDER TO KEEP CONTENT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I MISTER KILEY. I APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS A PRESS TO YOUR INTRODUCTION COULD YOUHELP ME UNDERSTAND ALL THAT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD STANDARD AND HAT THAT'S HOW THAT WOULD KIND OF WORK IN PRACTICE I GET A LETTER THAT THE BARONESS ADDRESS% BECAUSE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THESE DEFINITIONS IN THE UK YEAH- THE BEST INTEREST IS A CONCEPT FROM CHILDREN'S RIGHTS LEGISLATION THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD WHICH HAS A HUNDRED NINETY SIX SIGNATORY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND IT IS- IT HAS A LOT OF CASE LAW BEHIND IT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS UNDERSTAND AS BEING A BALANCING ACT SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION IN FRONT OF YOU AND IS IT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD TO DO ABLE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IS I HAVE SINCE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF ENGINEERS AND THAT LIKE THAT STANDARD IS THERE YOU KNOW ACT CAN YOU OPTIMIZE FOR STICKINESS IS THAT A OR B. AS A SIMILAR QUESTION FOR THEM AS- CAN YOU ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF A CHILD A. B. I WOULD SAY. THAT SIDE OF THE US AND HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CANCEL BUT THE WAY THAT USUALLY HERE THAT- THAT FREEZE USES YOU'RE DEALING WITH LIKE A JUDGE WHOSE- DISCERNING THAT AFFECT A PARTICULAR CHILD IN A PARTICULAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES HERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CORPORATION SOMEHOW MAKE THAT JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ALL CHILDREN I MEAN HOW DO YOU EVEN AND THAT SORT OF ANALYSIS WHEN I THINK YOU SEE HOW THEY HAVE BEEN DONE SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE DECIDED IT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CHILDREN TO CONTINUE. IN TO OUR STRANGE HEALTH TO DIRECT MESSAGE. AT UNDER AGE CHILDREN AND THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS OF WHACK OUT OF THE CODE AND I THINK THAT UNTIL IT WAS IN THE INBOX TO CONSIDER CHILDREN HOW WOULD YOU DO IT DIFFERENTLY IF YOU KNEW THE END USER WAS A CHILD THEY WENT HOSKING THE QUESTION. IS WERE COMPLETE AC THE MAPS YOU'RE NOT. TO MAKE A SYSTEM THAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST. OF CHILDREN. OKAY THAT SO YOU SAYING THAT THIS THIS HAS ACTUALLY APPLIED IN THE IN THE WAY THAT IT'S BEING APPLIED HERE ANOTHER ANOTHER- JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. INDEED INDEED I'M NOT AND I'M% NOT GOING TO PRETEND TO YOU THAT EVERY AND THAT THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE. YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE EVERY SINGLE DECISION THAT THE IN THE THAT A COMPANY CAN MAKE BUT THAT ALREADY IS NOT A BRIGHT LINE OF THE DECISIONS THAT MAKING SO I THINK THAT. THAT THIS IS A INTENT ON THE PRINCIPLES THAT THAT CODE SET TOP TWO. YEAH A VERY CLEARLY INTENTIONAL AND IT GIVES A LOT OF SPACE TO THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO INTERPRET THEM. AND MEET THE BOMB AND- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY LAID DOWN IN MORE DETAIL SO THERE ARE SOME SAFE HARBORS WERE. EXCELLENT AND Z. THEN YOU'RE- NOT SUBJECT TO LITIGATION BASED ON THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD STANDARD. THERE IS NOT. A SERGEANT YEAH I WAS JUST TO JUMP INTO YOU DON'T MIND. I JUST I JUST ONE FOR FIRMEST HAS BEEN- THIS THIS NOTION. THE WAY ABOUT THE BEST INTERESTS AND WE'VE CHANGED IT. IF IN THE AMENDMENTS EVERY TAKE ON THIS COMMITTEE TOTHE BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN AND MOVED INTO FINDING SOME DECORATIONS. SO THIS IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT AS AS FOLKS ARE THINK ABOUT THIS A CALL IF A CONFLICT ARISES BETWEEN COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND THE BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN COMPANIES SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE PRIVACY SAFETY. AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN OVER COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THAT HAS BEEN MOVED INTO THE- SECTION THE FINDINGS OF DECORATION THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE AYE AYES ADS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD NOT BE THE STANDARD ACCORDING WHICH LIABILITIES IF YOU COULD. WHAT CORRECT ALTHOUGH WE I WILL SAY NO A RESERVE THIS FOR MY TIME WHEN I SPEAK THERE I THINK WE DO NEED TO THERE NEED TO BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE REMEDY ISSUE I THINK ALL PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- AND I THINK IT'S SUBJECT TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT OPERATIVE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD ATTACK. OKAY THAT'S GOOD I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO ME OFTEN WE HAVE THESE DEBATES SORT OF YOU KNOW WITH SOME TRYING TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT PLAY A ROLE IN THIS AND WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS WHILE OTHERS YOU KNOW I'D BE ON THIS I GENERALLY SAY THEY SHOULD BE LEFT TO FAMILIES SEEMS LIKE HAVING THE CORPORATION MAKE THE DECISIONS HAVE THE WORST OF ALL WORLDS THAT'S NOT I WILL CORPORATIONS ARE ARE ARE BUILT FOR HIMSELF I'M- SIR. ABOUT STANDARD THAT WOULD SORT. DEPUTIZE THAT RESPONSIBILITY- TO A CORPORATION WHICH IS SORT OF BY ITS NATURE- I'VE YOU KNOW A PROFIT MAXIMIZING ENTITY AND- IS NOT NECESSARILY AND TO DO WE USUALLY ASK TO MAKE YOU SORT OF. OF SOCIAL DEBT YOU KNOW JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PUBLIC GOOD. TRY TO RESPONSE I'M JUST GONNA ALSO ADD YOU KNOW I THINK. PART WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS. PROVIDE MORE PARAMETERS FOR THE AGENCY THE REGULATORY AGENCY WHO I THINK IS GOING TO BE. A MORE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE UPS AND DOWNS OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MORE THAN THIS CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE IS- IT'LL BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES AND I THINK A MORE SIGNIFICANT KIND OF WAY- WAS ESTABLISHING THE- SUPPORTERS I THINK CAN HELP GIVE INPUT TO SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES AROUND SOME OF THE STUFF AS WELL SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE FLEXIBILITY TO REGULATORY AGENCIES WILL. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IF YOU DON'T MIND EARNEST MONEY GO TO- SIMILAR ABOUT HER QUE HAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THINGS ONE IS. I AM. THESE THAT I THINK EVERY TIME I TURN ON MY END HERE PODCAST I HEAR AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES OPPOSING TODAY'S BELL ABOUT HOW THEY WANT US TO REGULATE THEM. WELL HERE WE ARE ASKING YOU TO DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST YOUR CHILDREN AND GUESS WHAT. OPPOSING IT SEEMS WE WILL TURN THE APPS OFF AND STOP SPENDING YOUR MONEY- SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IS FOR EACH OF YOU TO COME TO THE TABLE. AND TO BE. WILLING TO DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR CHILDREN AND NOT WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUR BOTTOM LINES BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW AND IS THE MOTHER OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD. WHO WAS JUST ENGAGING THE BEHAVIOR THAT I'M ONLY DISCUSSED GETTING ONLINE AND- TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHAT MIDDLE SCHOOL LOOKS LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR GIVING VOICE TO. BECAUSE I SEE IT EVERYDAY IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD AS A PARENT. I LOVE YOU TOUCHED ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PARENT IN THE STATE AGE WE DIDN'T GROW UP WITH THIS. TO ME TO HELP GUIDE HIM THROUGH IT IS ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO THROUGH THIS IS THAT. AS A YOUNG PERSON. AND YET IT IS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT. IT LOOKS LIKE FOR IT TO FAIL OUR FAMILIES. I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. IT IS EVERY MOTHER'S WORST NIGHTMARE TO LOSE A CHILD. AND THE FACT THAT WE KNOW. WE KNOW BASED ON TESTIMONY IN THE FEDERAL. MEANT THAT THERE WAS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE BEFORE THE- TECHNOLOGY. COMPANY DOING. CHILDREN IT TURNS THEIR BACK. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED AND WE KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN CONGRESS KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON SITTING ON THIS GUYS IS THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR CHILDREN. AND SO TO THE COMING OF. TURNOFF WE CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN IN YOUR PROFITS AND WE'RE GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT. SO I AM GLAD YOU KEPT AT SEVENTEEN I LOVE THAT THAT MIGHT MY SIX YEAR OLD AND HAVE ACCESS TO A DEVICE SO TO BE HONEST BILL WOULDN'T BE AS MEANINGFUL IF IT WERE THIRTEEN AND UNDER. BUT A TWELVE YEAR OLD MY SON IS NOT GETTING ACCESS. THESE THINGS TO BE PAID ATTENTION TO SO I THINK SEVENTEEN IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE EIGHTEEN IF YOU WILL. I AND I THINK THE STANDARD YOU SET FORTH. LOOK IF I AM A FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY EVER IF A COMPANY CAN COME INTO COURT AND SHOW. THE DAY. LAID IT OUT AND THEN. THEY MADE THEY BELIEVE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF AUTUMN I AM I BELIEVE THAT UNDER THIS STANDARD SET FORTH. THE COURT WOULD NOT FIND THEM TO BE LIABLE TO ANSWER. MY COLLEAGUES QUEST. YOU DOING. WITH DOING TODAY INSIDE THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY WELL DONE AND I'M GLAD WE HAVE YOU HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT IS PLAYED OUT IN PRACTICE BUT- FOR EMILY AND EVERY. SINGLE PERSON. LIKE EMILY THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE AND WE SHOULD ALL BE SUPPORTING THIS IN A BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS WAY. AND ATTACKED MANY SHOULD LISTEN TO THEIR OWN ADS AND COME TO THE TABLE AND SUPPORT IT SO THINKING ABOUT. MISTER BENNETT. I KNOW THIS IS A LONG MEETING AND WE ALL HAVE IMPORTATION MAYBE TRY TO BE AS CONCISE AS I CAN I REALLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL HAVE ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOU WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE FROM GREAT BRITAIN. ALL COMPANIES HAVE TO DO IN GAUGING THE DIFFICULT TASK OF TRYING TO DE IDENTIFY WHETHER A PARTICULAR USER IS A CHILD. THAT WILL HELP. TRYING TO BE AN ADULT OR WHAT I LIKE IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING IS NO THEY SIMPLY HAVE SAY THESE ARE THE STANDARD TWO GOING TO APPLY TO A- KALITA. ARE NOT. DON'T TO DO THE DIFFICULT. OF DOING THAT CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT PLEASE YES I CAN AND I THINK THEY HAVE TWO CHOICES ONE IS. TO THE BALLOT LATE ACCESS. FOLLOWED THE- PROTOCOL AND THEREFORE WE DON'T YOU KNOW IT IS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO COMES ASIDE. THAT THIS IS THAT CAN AT IDENTA THE AGE OF THAT YOU. AT AT THIS POINT THAT. MOST OF THESE COMPANIES DO IDENTIFY THE H. OF THE USER. READY AT BUT THEY WISH HIM WELL I'M NOT SECURE NOT PREVIOUSLY PRESENT THANK NOT TRANSPARENT AND ANOTHER TO THE BUS. SO I THINK THAT THE VISIONS EIGHT SURE. BUT IS DONE RIVAS THE PRESENT BASIS AND ACTUALLY PULLS THE PREFER OF CHILDREN RATHER THAN EXTENDS FURTHER SURVEILLANCE INTO THEM AND ALSO JUST TO SAY THE IN THE U. K. WE HAVE ACTUALLY POST LOOKING AT AGE STEP THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T. UNDER NEED TO KNOW. IT IS OF A CHILD YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW ROUGHLY WHERE THEY ARE ROUGHLY WHERE YOUR USER GROUP IS AT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE. AT VIDEO SEVEN LEGAL TAXED YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THAT SEVEN EIGHT OR ELEVEN AB YEAH BUT YOU MAY WISH TO KNOW THAT THAT NOT SO. THANK AND- POSTED THERE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT CORPORATIONS TO BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS- THAT- MY COLLEAGUE WAS REFERRING TO I WOULD OFFER- EMILY COMING TODAY TO TESTIFY TESTIFY IS A GOOD IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY NOT FOLLOWING. OF DOING WHAT'S THE PERSON IN A STEP PUTTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE IN FRONT AND SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THIS IS DEPUTISING CORPORATIONS IT'S RATHER. THEM TO A MINIMUM. THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS ALSO TO BE. ON SO THAT'S THE DISTINCTION THAT I WOULD MAKE RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU AND IF I MIGHT SAY IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS TO SAY THAT FOR MANY YEARS. I. IT TAKES STANDS USE AND ACTUALLY IT IS ONE OF HUNDREDS OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN RESPONSE. TO A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO PRODUCT DESIGN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WISH TO SPEAK OR HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT NONE. I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU.

ONLY FACING AND PRETENSION BASED THUS FAR ON ENTANGLEMENT OF POLICE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE COOPERATE WITH CONTACT TRACING. CONTACT TRACING INFORMATION ABOUT WHO A PERSON WAS WITH WHEN AND WHERE IS COLLECTED BY POLICE IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY SHARE LESS OF THEIR PERSONAL AND- IF IT. M.

ALL RIGHT WE GOING TO BE MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWO ZERO. EIGHT NINE BY SO WE MOVED OUR CAKE AND. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST- I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL- FROM ITS INCEPTION TO TODAY. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL TO MOVE THE PROVISIONS TO THAT CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT TO PROTECT. PROTECTIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DATA UNDER EXISTING LAW NAROW THE DEFINITION FOR COVERED MENTAL HEALTH APPS AND REMOVED THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT AND INSTEAD REQUIRE APPS TO NOTIFY PROVIDERS OF VIOLATIONS UPON. CONTRACTING WITH THEM. TODAY I'M PRESENTING ON AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE WHICH WILL HELP PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THOSE WHO USE MENTAL HEALTH APPS. THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS WHAT SURGERIES ARE HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE YOU HAD HOW OFTEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HOW OFTEN IN THE LAST YEAR HAVE YOU HAD FIVE OR MORE ALCOHOLIC DRINKS ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS. WHICH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION HAVE MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO THREE HOW OFTEN DO YOU FEEL THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE MIGHT HAPPEN. IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE ANY INFORMATION COLLECTED WOULD BE PROTECTED BY HIPPA. BUT IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS CAN TO CONNECT TO A PROVIDER THROUGH AN APP YOUR INFORMATION WOULD ONLY BE ACTED BY THE C. PUREE. THIS IS COULD AT AS WE SELL THE INFORMATION OR USER FOR ADVERTISING. SB SINCE DAMAGE MY OCCURS THIS IS A- WITH AS MANY AS TWENTY THOUSAND APPS IN THIS CASE GLOW- IS. PUT HER ADVERTISEMENT IN. BASED OFF A PROBLEM DYCHE. THEN THEY WILL REQUIRE A DETAILED SURVEY WITH QUESTIONS TARGETING HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE THE ONES I'VE GIVEN YOU. WE'VE SEEN DATA SHARED WITH THESE APPS SHOP ACROSS THE INTERNET AND EVEN SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES. A STUDY OF THE THIRTY SIX TOP RANKED APPS FOR DEPRESSION AND SMOKING FOUND THAT TWENTY NINE TRANSMITTED DATA SERVICES PROVIDED BY FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE. IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE RECEIVING CARE THEY KNOW HOW THEIR DATA IS SHARED AND HOW IT IS PROTECTED IF AT ALL. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY EQUALIZE THE PROTECTIONS FOR DATA THAT CONNECTS PATIENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE BY INCLUDING THESE APPS AND SIEMIATYCZE. THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL IS TO AID HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH GOOD. WHEN APPS WITH PROVIDERS THEY MUST INFORM THE PROVIDERS AND ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW IF THESE ARE GOOD ACTORS. MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS HEALTH CARE AND TODAY WHEN YOU SEEK THAT HELPED HER THROUGH THESE APPS YOUR INFORMATION IS NOT PROTECTED AS HEALTHCARE DATA THIS BILL WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN CHANGING THAT LANDSCAPE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS HAYLEY. TSUKAYAMA SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND THEN DETESTS IMPOSSIBLE POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS MAYBE THEY'RE BOTH ON THE FRONT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE. THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE THEM BOTH OF WHO WHO'S GOING FIRST. I HAVE THAT AND- PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THANK YOU APRIL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KELLY PAMELA AND I AM YOUR LEGISLATIVE ACCESS AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. AND THAT MAKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE TURNED ON FOR CARE PARTICULARLY FROM THE HEALTHCARE MANY DIGITAL SERVICES OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INCREASED THE DEMAND. THEY OFFER CARE CONNECTIONS PROVIDERS PRESCRIPTION REPORT GROUP. HOWEVER THE STATE OF NOT ALWAYS KEPT PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL PLATFORMS ADVERTISING HERE BAKER IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE ARE NOT PROTECTED Y HIPPA. THAT'S OUT OF LINE WITH THE EXPECTATIONS PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS HAVE REGARDING. FOR THE STIGMA REGARDING MENTAL AS A RESULT THERE IS A LEVEL OF REASONABLE PEOPLE EXPECT WHEN THEY ARE CONNECTED TO CARE THIS TRUSTED UNDERMINE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO SHARE DIAGNOSES MEDICAL HISTORIES AND OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION OF THIS TYPE OF A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION STUDY REVEALED THAT CALL PERSON HEALTH APPS AND ABOUT. IT IT IT. THIRD PARTY SOME OF THE DATA COULD BE LINKED BACK TO. EITHER ANY. EIGHTEEN THIRD PART RECEIVED SPECIFIC I CAN. IN TWENTY TWO RECEIVE OTHER KEY HOW IMPROVE. THIS TYPE OF. TREATABLE THE SHARING TEACHERS CRIME AND THE CREDIT OF MENTAL CARE. IT ALSO PUT THE BURDEN ON PROVIDE TO THE AT HIM TO SEE CAN BE FOR BY THE- THAT THEY- THE HEALTH CARE. IS UNIQUE VULNERABLE TO EXT. FOR ADVERTISEMENT AFTER PROFIT. PUTTING THE BILL THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH. DR FEEL STATED WE WERE WITH INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CLIENT INFORMATION THAT WHEN EXPLOITED CAN LEAD TO PREDATORY ADVERTISING OR EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHEN WE USE DIGITAL PLATFORMS ARE MAKE IT RECOMMENDED TO OUR PATIENTS THEY ARE EXACTLY A SECURE EITHER IN PERSON. HE BELIEVES THE BILL'S. TO PROVIDE NEEDED FOR PATIENTS INFORMATION AND GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR DATA IS SHARED AND TO MEANINGFULLY CONSENT TO THAT SHARING. FOR THESE REASONS WE SRONGLY- COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR SECOND PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT I NEED YOU TO SOME POT FROM CONSUMER REPORTS. HEAR ME. YES MANY. OKAY MY NAME IS DON TALK ABOUT THE ANALYSTS AT CONSUMER APART WE SUPPORT EIGHTY EIGHT ZERO EIGHT NINE BECAUSE THEY WOULD GET CONSUMERS KEEP PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVACY OF MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED DURING OUT BRING IT INTO ALIGNMENT WITH PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED IN A MEDICAL SETTING THE COMPANY THAT MAKE UP WHAT THE DEPRESSION. I THINK KIND OF MADE IT HARDER TO A CARE. MANY DIFFERENT HAVE TURNED MENTAL HEALTH APPS TO BUILD GAP BUT BECAUSE HE'S AFTER IN TWO THOUSAND COVERED BY. HOPE PRIVACY I CAN. CONSUMER DURABLE TO INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE RECORDER OF IN FROM. SUCH AS WHETHER THEY SUFFER FROM AND OR CO. STRESS. FIVE HELP PRIVACY A LOT BUT THE FAMILY ASKED ME PROVIDE NEW TRACKING DIARRHEA OR THERAPY TRAPASSO WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD NOT BE COVERED. APPLE BECAUSE CONSUMER REPORTS TESTING HAS FOUND THAT MENTAL HEALTH APPS SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT USERS WITH TECH COMPANIES THAT TRACK THEIR BEHAVIOR ACROSS OTHER APPS. AND THAT INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO TARGET ADS GEO CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEIR DATA MIGHT BE SHARED OR NEXT YEAR. WHEN I WAS THE ACTIVE DO ENOUGH TO PROTECT SENSITIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE DATA. ALLOW CONSUMERS TO TALK TO SELL THE CHRISTMAS. BUT THEY'RE STILL BY DEFAULT PROHIBITS BOTH THEY'RE SHARING AT ALL. MANY CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF THOSE RIGHT AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARE AWARE. OF REPORTS ABOUT THAT CONSUMERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OFTEN. TELL INFORMATION. FINALLY PROPERTY TWENTY FOUR AMENDED THE CCPA TECH ALSO WITHOUT A PARTNER A FEELING ON THE MEASURE. IT IS INTENDED TO BE STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO BETTER PROTECT OUR PRIVACY AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DATA THAT SHOULD HAVE GREATER PROTECTION. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BUDGET BASED ON OUR DRIVE. OUT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR MUCH WITH THAT WE WILL GUARD ANYONE IN THE- ROOM WISHES TO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER STACKED UP THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN. AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COLLABORATION ON THE BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TODAY. CURRENTLY BOUGHT FOR PERSONAL BUSINESS SUFFERS A DATA BREACH THE REPORT IS SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE BUSINESS POSTS. A REPORT OF THE BREACH ON THEIR WEBSITE. PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE HAD THEIR DATA EXPOSED ARE THEN NOTIFIED BY PHONE MAIL ANOTHER LECTURE ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE SAME PROCESS DID YOU. WHEN A STATE AGENCY SUFFERS A DATA BREACH HOWEVER CURRENT LAW IS VAGUE WHEN COMPANIES WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS SUFFER A DATA BREACH IN THESE INSTANCES THE COMPANIES GENERALLY POST THE REPORT OF THE DATA BREACH. RATHER THAN THE STATE AGENCY THIS METHOD OF REPORTING DOES NOT INFORM THE PUBLIC THAT THEIR INFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY BEING HANDLED BY A THIRD PARTY. THE PURPOSE OF THE REPORT MECHANISMS IS TO PROVIDE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH TRANSPARENCY OF HOW THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION IS HANDLED BY GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A STILL IN TODAY'S DIGITAL AGE. AS THIS INFORMATION QUITE LITERALLY PRESENTS THE KEYS TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS IF IT FALLS INTO THE WRONG HANDS. IDENTIFY IDENTITY THEFT IS BECOMING MORE MORE COMMON SO MUCH SO THAT IT IS NOW THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DATA BREACHES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND ACCOUNTS FOR FIFTY NINE PERCENT. OF ALL DATA BREACHES GLOBALLY. FURTHERMORE BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PHISHING SCHEMES MANY PEOPLE OFTEN ASSUME THAT THESE REAL NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE PRIVATE YEAH I AGENCIES ARE FRAUGHT. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE CONSIDERING THAT THESE NOTIFICATIONS MAY COME FROM A COMPANY THERE'S A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER HEARD OF OR HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH THEM BEFORE. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE FULLY FOR INFORMED ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENCE THAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS HANDLED RESPONSIBLY AB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN WOULD ALSO REQUIRE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REPORT DATA BREACHES OF ENTITIES. WHO ARE WORKING ON OR WITH THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO THE REPORTS POSTED BY THOSE ENTITIES THIS WILL PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH A MORE INFORMED UNDERSTANDING CLARITY HOW THEY'RE FROM.

THANK YOU MISTER I'M JUST GLAD YOU PRONOUNCE MY NAME. JUST GOOD IT'S PROGRESS- CHRISTIAN CAVIAR WITH PROGRESSION. I THOUGHT FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE BUT MOST OF ALL OF THE AUTHOR. I HATE BEING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF YOU BECAUSE I REALIZE HOW MUCH YOU DO CARE ABOUT CONSUMERS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP WITH THIS BILL AND- THANK YOU FOR. WILLING TO WORK WITH US HOUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SADLY AFTER OPPOSE THE BILL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO MENTION THE COMMITTEES. GIVE HER ALL THE UP ALL THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL THAT ONE CONSUMER GROUP AMONG THEM. I WANT. SO WHAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU TO DO IS JAM A BUILD ON THE CONSUMERS SO THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO. HEAR THE GROUP. THE BILL. IN AMERICAN EMPOWERMENT COALITION. THE NATIONAL ASIAN AMERICAN COALITION THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION. THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. CIAU LUWAK. THESE ARE ALL OPPOSED TO THIS CONSUMER FRIENDLY BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS WHAT. WOULD THEY TELL YOU IT DOES IT DOESN'T IT. FIFTEEN PAGE BILL BUT ONE OF THE MOST CONCERNING THAT THE PROMOTING IS. THE CONSUMER OR THE CSO IS SUPPOSED TO INDICATE WHICH ITEMS ARE TO BE REMOVED OR CHALLENGED. THAT IS NOT AT ALL. THE BURDEN OF THE CONSUMER THIS YET SO. IF YOU HAVE THE POWER TO RUIN SOME. HE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO JUSTIFY WHY YOU'RE DOING. SO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT WHEN A CONSUMER CHALLENGES SOMETHING OR ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS OR HER CREDIT. IT'S THE FURNITURE THAT COLLECTED AT SUPPOSED TO JUSTIFY WHY THAT CREDIT REPORT. THE WAY THAT THE US WHAT THIS BILL IT WAS NOW CONSUMER SUPPOSED TO SAY. THIS IS NOT MINE THIS IS NOT MINE THIS IS NOT MINE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS OFTENTIMES BECKETT'S BOUGHT ANY CHANGES NAMES SO IF YOU WANT TO MAY. YEARS AGO. ABOUT YOUR- YOU KNOW HAVE A REALLY LONG FOR CAPITAL YOU CAN'T SAY AWKWARD. I ON'T HAVE THIS DEBT THIS ISN'T MINE THEY WOULD KNOW. SO BY IF THIS BILL PASSES NOW THAT CONSUMERS SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S ON THE CREDIT REPORT AND THAT'S SIMPLY UNFAIR. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT SOMEBODY WHO REALLY EMBODIES CREDIT OR PROVIDE THAT ROUTE CRAP HAPPENS BY WHAT DOING. AND THIS WOULD PUT THAT ON ITS THAT'S A PROBLEM. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER ISSUE IS I KNOW A LOT OF YOU CARE. VERY DEEPLY ABOUT FOR HOUSING. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE STATE. CREDIT IS A HUGE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT WILL LIMIT SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO PREPARE THE CREDIT YOU CAN LIMIT SOMEBODY'S ABILITY GET APARTMENT TO BUY A HOUSE TO BUY AFFORDABLE CARD A REASONABLE RATE AND WITH INTEREST RATES GOING JUST GONNA GET WORSE. SO I I'M TELLING ALL RIGHT BAGS COMMITTEE THIS COMMITTEE TO REALLY RECONSIDER ITS PRIOR VOTE ON THIS BILL I KNOW IT VOTED OUT PREVIOUSLY IT PLAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW COMES NEW. TO MAKE WOULD REALLY EMPLOYEE TO CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WITH THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU PASTOR. WELL I DO WANNA THANK- THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY RUBIO I'M I'M SUPER IMPRESSED WITH YOU IN YOUR HEART NOW. LAST WE MEANT IT THERE'S BEEN SOME CHANGES- THE SHOWS THAT YOU GUYS ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON IT- BECAUSE OF COURSE CALIFORNIA IS A VERY- CONSUMER- ARE OUR SERVICE THAT WE HAVE HERE AND ASSEMBLY AND WE KNOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE FOR WHO. THE PAST AFTER ABOUT. BY CHURCH LAWCENTER. AND- I RUN A NONPROFIT THE- PROBLEM. WHICH WE DO FINANCED LITERACY TWICE A WEEK. OF COURSE CREDIT IS A BIG BIG DEAL IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BE POOR. IT'S EXPECTED TO HAVE BAD CREDIT. OR AT LEAST HAVE THINGS ON YOUR CREDIT THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE- THIS BILL IT HAS SOME GREAT COMPONENTS TO IT. BUT THEY'RE REALLY SOME SMOKE SCREEN. BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S THIS THE FEDERAL REGULATOR- AS A SMOKESCREEN AND NOT UNDERMINES WHAT THE- DECKLID REALLY. AND SO YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST. I SEE THEIR FACE I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING I KNOW WHAT THE GOING THROUGH. YOU GUYS TO BE THERE TO SEE CRY ABOUT YOU KNOW THE HARASSMENT ABOUT ALL DAY DOING THIS IS NOT I MEAN I THINK IT'S MOST INSULTING TO THINK THE DEBT COLLECTORS. THANK FOR. OF CAN. STEP COMPA OF INTEREST- I HEARD SEVERAL OTHER NONPROFITS. ON THE DUE CREDIT COUNSELING BUT THEY ALSO HELP. WITH DEBT SETTLEMENT SO THAT'S KIND OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST YOU'RE GOING TO HELP. YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON ONCE I'D- BEEN UP PICK A SIDE ISSUE BECOME. TO WORK FOR THE DEBT COLLECTORS OR YOU DON'T DO A LOT I DO WORK FOR CONSUMERS. AND SO I'M I'M IN STE THIS OPPOSITE. HOPE YOU. CAN SEE- SOME OF THE- PROCESS. LIFTING CONANT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS IN. BUT WE DON'T GO TO BE OUT WITH BATH. WE WANNA WE WANT TO JUST CLEAN WATER UP AND MAKE. FOR ALL. FOR YOU. TOTAL OPPOSITE.
