THE CONTACTS TERM IS TWENTY FIVE YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH YEAH NUMBER. WE CANNOT MOVE ON TO THE TRIBAL CHAIRMAN. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AUDIBLE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RYAN JACKSON I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE VALLEY TRIBE. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY FOUR A WHICH WILL RATIFY AMENDMENTS TO THE VALLEY TRIBES GAMING COMPACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR AS LONG TIME SUPPORT WHO VALLEY TRIBE AS WILLINGNESS TO SPONSOR OUR RATIFICATION BILL. SOME BACKGROUND VALLEY TRIBE IN HUMBLE COUNTY AS ONE OF THE LARGEST TRUST LAND BASES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS PROBLEM MEMBERS. TRY TO BUSINESSES INCLUDE ARE OPEN MANY MORE. I PUBLIC UTILITIES DISTRICT. DISABLED IN MOTEL LUCKY BEAR CASINO. AND HOOPER FORCED INDUSTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE CRUCIAL TO THE TRIBE ECONOMY IS A PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES AND JOBS TO THE COMMUNITY. TO ENSURE THAT LUCKY BURKE CASINO CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES SENATE BILL. SIX SEVENTY FOUR CODIFY THE EXISTING COMPACT THAT THE VALLEY TRIBE AGREED UPON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. TODAY THE VALLEY TRIBES THRIVING WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE WHO TRAVEL MEMBERS. THE TRIBE OWNS SEVERAL ENTERPRISES THAT OPERATE ON THE RESERVATION. INCLUDING LIKE UBER CASINO. ALL ACT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE VALLEY'S ECONOMY. THE CASINO CURRENTLY OPERATES BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED THIRTY MACHINES ON THE GAMING FLOOR AND IT'S TWENTY EMPLOYEES WELL WHICH ARE HOOPER TROUBLE MEMBERS. THE LAST CONTACT WAS RATIFIED IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TRIBES COMPACT WAS GREAT UPON. WITH GOVERNOR BROWN. I THE NEW COMPACT THIS BILL CODIFIES A TWENTY EIGHTEEN TROUBLE CONTACT BETWEEN STATE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO BELLY TRIBE SO THEY CAN OPERATE LOOKING BEAR CASINO. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE TRIBE TO OPERATE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE GAMING SEEMS TO HAVE UP TO TWO CASINOS. ON THE TRIBES TRUST LANDS. THE COMPACT INCLUDES UPDATED PROVISIONS FOR LICENSING COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT MITIGATION OF OFF RESERVATION IMPACTS. AND PROTECTIONS FOR PATRONS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECENT COMPAQ'S. BECAUSE THE TRIBE PLANS ARE EXTREMELY REMOTE THERE'S CURRENTLY NO OPERATES REASON NO OFFERS A RECENT IMPACT OF THE TRIBE'S CASINO. THIS COMPACT AMENDMENT WILL ALLOW THE TRIBE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE OR SMALL GAMING FACILITY FOR ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE STATE HAS AGREED TO WAIVE THE COST REGULATORY FEES TO THE STATE FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE LACKEY BURKE CASINO IS SO SMALL. AND THE LIGHT OF THE FACT. THAT THE TRIBE AGREED TO UPDATE THE REGULATORY PROVISIONS FROM THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPAQ. IS OUR HOPE THAT WITH PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LAST YEAR THAT WE WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY REGULATORY COSTS IN THE FUTURE. THE INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UPDATED REGULATORY PROVISIONS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CASINO REVENUES WHICH PROVIDES JOBS TO TRAVEL MEMBERS. THE STATE RECOGNIZED THAT THE TRIBE SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY REGULATORY COSTS IN LIGHT OF THE BURDEN. IT WOULD HAVE ON THE TRIBE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACT THE TRIBE NOT PAY SUCH COSTS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. THE TRIBE REGULATORY ABILITY HAS PROVEN TO BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO ENSURE THAT THE GAMING FACILITIES OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC SAFETY ENSURES THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAMING CONDUCTED THERE AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND HIS NEW TRAVEL NEGOTIATOR AND NAY MARK. OUR SUPPORT OF THIS FRAMEWORK. AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU MR GRAB. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACK RIBBON I REPRESENT UNITE HERE THE HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS UNION. WE HAVE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY -- THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION BEGAN TO APPROACH THE ISSUE OF TRIBAL GAMING COMPACTS REDUCING -- FINANCIAL BURDENS ON TRIBES. IN A TIME BEFORE THAT WERE SORT OF LIFTED UP TO USE IS A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE STATE BUDGET. AND IN OUR VIEW THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE BUT NOT OUR DECISION THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION TURN THAT AROUND -- APPROPRIATELY IN OUR VIEW AND AT THE SAME TIME. CREATED SOME ADDITIONAL HIGHER STANDARDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE. SHOULD THEY EVER CHOOSE TO DO THAT SO WE THINK THAT SAID THE DOUBLE APPROACH IS IS THE RIGHT ONE WE SUPPORT. THE HOOPER VALLEY TRIBES COMPAQ -- AND WE HOPE HE WE WE GET A UNANIMOUS VOTE OUT OF THE IS ASSEMBLY WHEN IT HITS THE FLOOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GROUP AND WE HAVE -- ANY OTHER TESTIMONY TODAY. FROM THE PUBLIC. SIGNAL BRING IT BACK. THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS MEMBERS. I'VE GOT. TO SOMETHING THERE FOR A MISS NAY MARK COULD. GIVE US COMMON UPDATE ON TRAVEL NATION GAMING FUND WHERE WE'RE AT AND NO WITH FOR NOT PAYING INTO THE OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR CONTACT JUST BE NICE TO SEE. THE COMMITTEE WORKED ON THAT ISSUE LAST SESSION AND GIVE US AN UPDATE THAT BE GREAT. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN GRAY -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION REMAINS SUPPORTIVE OF THE TRIBAL ADVISER CRISTINA SNYDER -- HAS BEEN CONVENING AND THE PANEL WHICH HAS ALL BEEN SELECTED SO THEY'VE HAD TWO MEETINGS AND THEY'RE ALL OPEN FOR A MEETING SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO COME PARTICIPATE THEY'RE MORE THAN WELCOME -- I WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS VERY PRODUCTIVE AND SO IN THOSE MEETINGS THIS SORT OF INITIAL. PANEL IS TRYING TO SET OUT THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR HOW THIS WILL GO MOVING FORWARD. AND ESTABLISH THE GUIDELINES BECAUSE MOST IMPORTANTLY TO US IS THAT THIS IS TRIBALLY LEAD -- SO IT IS COMPLETELY -- BASED ON TRIBAL BEATER HAD VIEWS ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WHERE THE SORT OF RULES AND AND GUIDELINES SHOULD BE. AND THERE IT THE PANEL IS MEETING MONTHLY AND THE NEXT TEAM GF MEETING WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR NINE AM ON FRIDAY JULY TWELFTH IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED -- SO -- THERE'S AN ANTICIPATED APPLICATION SOLICITATION -- THIS FALL -- SORT OF DEPENDING A LITTLE BIT ON PROGRESS AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS YEAR'S GRANT AWARDS WILL HOPEFULLY BE IN THE WINTER. EXCELLENT THANK YOU AND CAN YOU EXPAND A BIT ON THE GENERAL SCOPE OF OUR CLASS THREE GAMING. AUTHORIZES COME BACK IN THE NEW ONE SISTER. YES SO THE THE TRIBE IS AUTHORIZED -- AND PERMITTED ONLY TO OPERATE THE GAMING DEVICES WHICH ARE EXPLICIT IN THE COMPACT AND THAT FLOOR ACTUALLY FLOWS FROM THE CONSTITUTION. AND SO ON THAT IS ANY BANK TO OR PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES -- ANY DEVICES ARE GAMES ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER STATE LAW TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY -- AND THEN IF THE TRIBE IS INTERESTED THEY CAN ALSO SEPARATELY NEGOTIATE OFF TRACK WAGERING. AND SORRY ALSO SLOT MACHINES THE DRUG OVER THE STATE LOTTERY PEACE AGAIN SAY THAT. SO THEY ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE ANY AND GAMES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER THE STATE LAW FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY PROVIDED THAT THEY WILL NOT. DO THAT THROUGH THE USE OF THE INTERNET -- YEAH -- AND I'M HAPPY TO SORT OF GET BACK TO YOU FURTHER IF THERE'S MORE DETAIL SPECIFICALLY YOU WANT ON THAT BUT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW. AS I UNDERSTAND IS THAT RIGHT YEAH SO THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. STATES THAT -- THE STATE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE TRIBE -- GAMES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED FOR THAT ARE LEGAL WITHIN THAT STATE AND SO IT IS OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT -- WHAT CAN BE -- NEGOTIATED FOR UNDER THE COMPACT HAS TO BE LEGAL IN THAT STATE AND SO THAT FLOWS BOTH FROM THE LEGALIZATION OF LOTTERY AND THE THE LEGALIZATION OF BEING TO PERCENTAGE GAMES AS WELL AS SLOT MACHINES UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AND YOU MENTIONED ONLINE. LOTTERY NOT THEY'RE NOT NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE INTERNET. AND IS THAT CONSISTENT THROUGH -- MOST STATES CHARTER STANDING OR DO SOME OFFER ONLINE LOTTERY I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MEMBERS.

THE TRIBE IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND BUT IF IT DECIDES TO GO ABOVE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE TO THE DEVICES IT WILL NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED A LIMITED GAMING TRIBE.

LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY TERM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BUT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT -- RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES -- WILL BE WITH THE COUNTY RATHER THAN THE STATE AS IT IS WITH WHO BUT THE TRIBES HOTEL -- IS HEAVILY FREQUENTED BY HUNTERS SO SOMETHING THAT IS UNIQUE TO THE SUSANVILLE CONTACT IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL PROHIBITION ON NON LAW ENFORCEMENT POSSESSION OF WEAPONS AT A GAMING FACILITY.

GOOD MORNING EVERYONE -- GREETINGS CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DINA BEAUVAIS I AM THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA -- AS YOU HAD ASK QUESTIONS EARLIER I ALSO AM A PANELIST -- OF THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUND AND HAVE ATTENDED BOTH OF THOSE MEETINGS -- AND WILL BE ATTENDING AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH -- FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR -- I ALSO CO CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES -- OFFICE OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS TRIBAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- AND WE MEET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS -- I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF A LOT OF OTHER DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND THOSE ARE THE TWO STATE COMMITTEES THAT I THAT I'M ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF THIS IS A REAL INDIAN RANCHERIAS LOCATED. IN SUSANVILLE CALIFORNIA -- WITHIN LASSEN COUNTY THE TRIBE CONSISTS OF MY DO PARA RIVER AND WASH OF PEOPLE. THE TRIBE IS COMPRISED OF OVER TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBERS. OUR RESERVATION HAS GROWN STEADILY. FROM THE THIRTY ACRES AND NINETEEN TWENTY THREE TO OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED EIGHT THIRTEEN HUNDRED ACRES TODAY. THROUGH DONATIONS PURCHASES AND FEDERAL ENTRANCE LAND TRANSFERS -- LASSEN COUNTY CHALLENGES WE ARE AN EXTREMELY RURAL AREA. WE SUFFER FROM HIGH POVERTY RATES AS OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT EMPLOYERS AND LASSEN COUNTY. THE TRIBES DIAMOND MOUNTAIN CASINO AND HOTEL IS AMONG THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN THE REGION. MOST AREA RESIDENTS WORK FOR THE FEDERAL AND STATE PRISONS -- OR COUNTY OR STATE CALTRANS OR A LOT OF THE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS -- THERE ARE LIMITED -- TO AND THEY'RE LIMITED OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DINING OPTIONS ESPECIALLY AND SUSANVILLE AND OR ANY OTHER PLACE UNLESS AGAIN. AND THEY'RE ALSO MUCH SMALLER THAN SUSANVILLE -- THE TRIBE IS OPERATED THE DIAMOND MOUNTAIN CASINO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND HAS GRADUALLY EXPANDED THE INITIAL SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. OF FACILITY OUT IN A RESTAURANT HOTEL AND MOST RECENTLY A MICROBREWERY. THE HOTEL IS THE ONLY GREEN CERTIFIED HOTEL WITHIN LASSEN COUNTY AND SERVICE FEDERAL AND STATE EMPLOYEES TRAVELING THROUGHOUT THE AREA. WHILE THE TRIBE HAS EXPANDED THE AMENITIES AND ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AT THE CASINO IT HAS REMAINED UNLIMITED GAMING TRIBE. CURRENTLY OFFERING APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED CLASS THREE GAMING DEVICES AND LIMITED TABLE GAMES. THE CASINO HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY OF THE REGION AND THE COMMUNITY OF THE REGION. THE CASINOS EVENT SPACE SPACES HOSTS A MULTITUDE OF FUND RAISERS AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. THE DIAMOND MOUNTAIN CASINO GIVES AWAY APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO LOCAL CHARITABLE CAUSES. THE TRIBES GAMING ENTERPRISE ALSO PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT TO FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED OF STE AND SIX OF WHOM ARE NOT TRIBAL MEMBERS. THE DIAMOND NOT JUST YOU KNOW GIVES AWAY -- SO THERE IN GAMING REVENUES ALSO SUPPORT VITAL TRIBAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS EDUCATION CHILD CARE AND ELDER SERVICES FOR THE TRAVEL THE TRIBAL MEMBERS. THE TRIBE ALSO PAYS THE CITY OF SUSANVILLE -- UP. TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO OFFSET THE COSTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE CASINO AND THE TRIBE. WITHIN SUSANVILLE CITY LIMITS. THE CITY IS SUSAN BILLS POLICE CHIEF COULD NOT ATTEND TODAY -- DUE TO A SCHEDULING CONFLICT HOWEVER HE HAS PROVIDED A WRITTEN STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE WHICH I WILL READ NOW. GREETINGS I AM HONORED TO WRITE THIS LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THE SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA AND DIAMOND MOUNTAIN TO SEE NOW. AS A FORTY THREE YEAR RESIDENT OF SUSANVILLE A THIRTY YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT VETERAN AND CURRENT POLICE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF SUSANVILLE. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AS A PARTNER WITH THE SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS ALONG WITH YOUTH MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL COACHING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. DURING THOSE YEARS I HAVE SEEN THE INCREASE IN SIZE OF THE DIAMOND ON CASINO AS WELL AS INCREASING BLEAK. INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA AND DIAMOND NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TO OUR COMMUNITY. THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE FIRST TO COME TO THE COMMUNITIES NEEDS IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY TRAGEDY OR HELP OR HELP. DIAMOND MOUNT THIS YOU KNOW HAS PROVIDED -- HOSTED ENDLESS FUNDRAISERS FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN NEED WHETHER IT IS FUNDRAISING FOR MEDICAL ISSUE. HELP A FOR HELPING A FAMILY FOR A NOBLE CAUSE. DIAMOND MEMPHIS YOU KNOW IS ALWAYS THERE TO HELP. DEMOCRACY NO IS THE MOST FAMILIAR SPONSOR FOR OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THEY AND THE SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA PROVIDE ASSISTANCE SUIT TO CIVIC GROUPS YOUTH GROUPS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY EVENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT WOULD BE RARE TO ATTEND AN EVENT IN SUSANVILLE AND NOT SEE A WATER BOTTLE WITH THE DIAMOND MOUNTED CASINO LABEL. AND IS MOST LIKELY BEEN DONATED. THEY HAVE COME TO THE COMMUNITIES RESCUE ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TO HELP BECAUSE AS THE POLICE OF CHIEF MY INTERACTION WITH THE CIVIL INDIAN RANCHERIA DATES BACK THIRTY YEARS. WE MEET REGULARLY WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE RANCHERIA AND THEY HOSTED QUARTERLY LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLABORATION. TO DISCUSS ISSUES AND TRENDS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ONCE COLLABORATED WITH THE RANCHERIA TO HIRE NATIVE NATIVE AMERICAN POLICE OFFICER. IN A PARTNERSHIP. RECENTLY THE RANCHERIA HAS GRACIOUSLY DON'T PROVIDED VEHICLES THAT WE WILL HAPPILY PLACE THEIR LOGO ON TO SHOW OUR PARTNERSHIP. WE JUST PURCHASED TWO VEHICLES -- EACH OF THOSE VEHICLES -- COST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO WE HAVE PAID FOR THOSE BOTH IN FULL -- MEMBERS OF THE DIAMOND MOUNTAIN CASINO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND EFFORTS TO PREVENT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AT THE CASINO AND IF DISCOVERED WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THESE ARE VERY THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS IS A INDIAN RANCHERIA HAS PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY. IN CLOSING SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA AND THE DIAMOND MOUNT CASINO HAVE BEEN AN ASSET TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE BEEN A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I MEASURE THE DIAMOND MOUNTAIN CASINOS VALUE BY EVALUATING WHAT THEY WOULD. WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF THEY WERE NOT HERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WOULD BE IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS? UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN A POSITIVE MANNER WE FULLY SUPPORT THE SIZZLE INDIAN RANCHERIA AND I'M IN MOUNT CASINO RESPECTFULLY KEVIN ALL JONES CHIEF OF POLICE. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED GAMING MARKET AND DIM PROSPECTS FOR EXPANSION THE TRIBE IS MADE PROACTIVE INVESTMENTS AND NON GAMING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- OPPORTUNITIES THE TRIBE OWNS AND OPERATES ENTERPRISES IN DIVERSE FIELDS FROM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION TO MEDICAL STAFFING SCREEN PRINTING AND APPAREL SERVICES. THE TRIBES ENTERPRISES HAVE REPURPOSE PORTIONS OF AN ARMY SUB. ARMY DEPOT IS NEARBY IN HER LONG CALIFORNIA -- AND THIS WAS RECEIVED UNDER THE BRACH. UP PROCESS. AND NOW WE ARE -- WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOMES THAT ARE. ANYWHERE FROM 9821100% OCCUPANCY AT ALL TIMES. AND WE HAD TO DO A LOT OF WORK TO BRING THOSE BACK UP THEY WERE IN HORRIBLE CONDITION WHEN WE RECEIVE THEM -- THE LESSON AND IN HOUSE CENTER MANAGED BY THE TRIBE PROVIDES SORELY NEEDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED POPULATION. OF WE ARE. PROBABLY THE SECOND OF LARGEST HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT ACCEPTS MEDICARE HOW WE KNOW MEDICARE THAT'S MEDICAID AND CALIFORNIA. AND OUR PARTNERSHIP IN OUR AREA -- THE TRIBE ALSO OWNS A NUMBER VENTURES WITH A NATION WIDE REACH INCLUDING FOR TRIBES CONSTRUCTION SERVICES. OF ATI DESPITE OUR EXTENSIVE EFFORTS AT NON GAMING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GAMING REVENUES ARE A VITAL FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE TRIBES GOVERNMENT. THE CREW THE TRIBE CURRENTLY OPERATES OPERATES ITS GAMING FACILITY UNDER IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE IN. TWENTY TWENTY AB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE WHAT ALLOW THE TRIBE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IT'S SMALL GAMING FACILITY UNDER A NEW TRIBAL STATE COMPACT. I ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VENTURA MISTER -- EGG A GOOD MORNING AGAIN -- JACK RIBBON WITH UNITE HERE -- THE HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS UNION AND JUST TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN THAT FROM THE CHAIR WOMAN'S PRESENTATION. NOT RELYING ON TRIBAL MONEY TO FUND OUR GENERAL FUND GIVES TRIBES THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THE EXPANSION OF THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO ORGANIZE SHOULD THEY SO CHOOSE AT SOME POINT. ALSO SHOWS RESPECT FOR THE ENGINE BEHIND THESE CASINOS AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. FOR TAKING ON THE VIEW IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION HAD ON THESE CONTACTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MALL. ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC. ONE MORNING ALL MY NAME IS ROBERT JOSEPH ON THE DISTRICT TO COUNCILMEMBER FOR THE SUSAN WILLINGDON RANCHERIA. HERE ON BEHALF WITH -- WITH OUR TRIBAL CHAIRWOMAN -- I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOING ON WITH OUR WITH WITH OUR CASINOS STUFF IS THAT. IS THAT WE PUT A LOT OF WERE WERE OR NOT A PER CAPITA TRIBE WE DON'T GIVE OF MONEY OUT TO THE TRIBAL MEMBERS. BUT WHAT WE DO FOCUS ON IS EDUCATION. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A A PROGRAM FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND STUFF FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL WELL. IN IN -- WE PAY THEM YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THEY KEEP THEIR GREAT THIS STUFF UP. WE HAVE -- I NINETY FIVE PLUS PERCENT. RETURN ON THIS WHICH IS HUGE TO US BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR US EDUCATION THERE'S THERE'S NO NO LIMIT TO THAT -- IN IN I THINK THE THE BIGGEST THING FOR US IS IS IS A TRIBE IS -- OUR GOAL OF SELF SUFFICIENCY YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE WANT EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS TO BE AS IS SELF SUFFICIENT. WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE -- TO RELY ON ANYBODY BUT THEMSELVES -- AS A TRIBAL COUNCIL MEMBER I SAID ON OUR HOUSING BOARD AS WELL YOU KNOW WE ARE. WE WE JUST BUILT A FOUR PLEX DOWN IN THE CITY A SUSANVILLE FIRST TIME OF GOING OFF THE RESERVATION TO TO TO BUILD A HOUSING WHATEVER. SO THAT MEANS WERE NOT EXEMPT FROM ANY OF THE BUILDING CODES TAXES ARE ARE ANY OF THAT. FENCE SO THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE. LAST I HEARD I LOOKED AT IT WAS ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT THAT WE PAID IN FOR OUR OUR BUILDING CODES AND AND STUFF IN THAT SENSE WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL -- YOU KNOW JUST THAT YOU KNOW WERE IN THE SAME. IS ANYBODY ELSE REALLY YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST OUT TO TO DO WHAT WE CAN FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO TO OUR ABILITY -- EVEN THROUGH OUR OUR TAXES AND AND STUFF THROUGH THAT YOU KNOW -- FOR THE EMPLOYMENT THAT WE HAVE -- THE STATE TAXES IN WHAT BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW JUST PUT AUTHORS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT A PER CAPITA TRIBE. WE DON'T WE DON'T GIVE ALL THE MONEY TO THE TO THE TRIBAL MEMBERS -- WHAT WE DO PUT OR A BIG MAJORITY THAT MONEY INTO EDUCATION AND? I'VE BEEN ON THE TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR TWELVE YEARS NOW -- AND YOU KNOW I JUST SEE THE TREMENDOUS JOB THAT THIS IS DOING YOU KNOW FOR OUR PEOPLE IN IN IT'S NOT YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE SUCH OF A LITTLE SMALL PLACE OR AT A LOT OF US LIVE. OFF THE RESERVATION INTO THE BILL IN LASSEN COUNTY. SO THAT MAKES US NOT EXEMPT FROM ANYTHING WE JUST. LIKE THE NEXT INDIVIDUAL WAR WE STILL PAY THE STATE TAX AND WHATEVER ELSE ON ON ON TOP OF THAT. SO BUT ANY LARGE FROM THANK YOU GUYS FOR HAVING SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC. SEEING NONE WILL BRING BACK THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. THIS JONES SAWYER. I HAVE A ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS END UP ACTUALLY ONE MAYBE IT IS MORE OF A COMMENT YOU MIGHT BE EVEN. HELP US GET SOME OF OUR WORK DONE -- AS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY I'M KIND OF CURIOUS OF HOW THESE GUNS AND GAMBLING. BRINGING GUNS. TO TO THE RICH RESORT -- DO YOU CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REGISTERED -- UNDER THE CHAIRMAN MAY THINK IT'S OKAY TO HAVE GUNS AND GAMBLING AT THE SAME TIME. IT WORKS SO WELL FOR WHILE BILL HICKOK'S ALIVE JUST KIND OF WHERE CAN THEY BRING. THOSE WEAPONS IN I KNOW YOU SAY THEY BRING TO ROOM. BUT THEY DON'T BRING IT DOWN TO THE TABLES OR ANY A NO I DON'T KNOW I'M TRYING TO GET A FEEL AND HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE. NO ONE'S BRINGING IN SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VERY HARMFUL WITHIN. THE CASINO SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M. THE THERE ARE NO GUNS THAT ARE ALLOWED ON THE GAMING FLOOR. SO OUR CASINO OF COURSE IS SEPARATE FROM OUR HOTEL. WE HAVE A SEPARATE ENTRANCE AND EXIT FOR THE HOTEL -- THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW -- A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BRINGING GUNS AND ARE ALSO OUR CORRECTIONAL TRANSPORT AND DRIVERS CORRECTIONAL OFFICER TRANSPORT DRIVERS -- THERE ARE SOME SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE HUNTING -- ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT LASSEN COUNTY IS THAT IT IS A BIG HUNTING AREA -- BUT YES THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOADED WHEN THEY'RE THERE. THEIR AMMUNITION IS SUPPOSED TO BE SEPARATE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEPT IN THEIR ROOM AND OR BEING WALKED OUT TO THEIR VEHICLES -- OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY TO LEAVE THEIR WEAPON IN THEIR VEHICLE AND HAVE IT BROKEN INTO AND STOLEN. SO THIS IS MUCH SAFER WE DO HAVE A ROOM SAFES IN THE IN THE HOTEL ROOMS. AND IN MY SECOND IS IT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US YOU KNOW I'VE HAD SOME WILL TRY TO COME TO MY OFFICE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. GET LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE LAWS. ON TRIBAL LANDS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP CRITICISM BILL POLICE DEPARTMENT -- AND THAT WHERE -- SOMEONE COULD COME TO CASINO CAUSE A DISTURBANCE OR A DISH DUMPING ON TRIBAL LANDS AND OTHER -- REALLY CRIMES AND EIGHT FOR FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY CANNOT GET A LOCAL SHERIFF ORDER TO COME OUT AND ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOBS AND ARREST THESE PEOPLE. SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION HOW. YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THIS CLOSE COOPERATION BECAUSE BY LAW. LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING BUT THEY DON'T ON SOME TRIBAL LAND SO MAYBE YOU CAN TELL WHICH SECRETIVE. ON IN GETTING THAT -- GOOD CLOSE COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO IT IT SO JUST TO KIND OF GO BACK A LITTLE BIT. I'M. AGAIN IT'S A PUBLIC WATER ANY STATE -- ANYTHING THAT IS CRIMINAL OBVIOUSLY LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE COMING ON TO THE RANCHERIAS OR THEY'RE NOT RESERVATIONS NECESSARILY IN. CALIFORNIA BUT ON TO TRIBAL LAND AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS. WHEN I I'VE BEEN THE CHAIRWOMAN FOR JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW? AND SO. IN THE TWO YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT THE CHAIR WOMAN WE WERE HAVING THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT COALITION MEETING. ONLY TWICE A YEAR. WELL I'VE CHANGE THAT TO ONCE A QUARTER -- I HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE I'VE ALSO BEEN A SOCIAL WORKER. FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH. THE CHIEF OF POLICE WHENEVER HE WAS THE DA'S INVESTIGATOR AND I SAID ON THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM AND WE YOU KNOW WE WERE DOING AND AND INTERVIEWS WITH CHILDREN AND THINGS SO. I HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP THE GOOD THING ABOUT SUSANVILLE IS THAT. WERE ALL MOST OF US HAVE BEEN BORN AND IF WE HAVEN'T LIVED THERE ALL OF OUR LIVES WE'VE GONE AWAY AND COME BACK. SO JUST UTILIZING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE RANCHERIA BUT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO COME IN -- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK. AGAIN IT'S JUST TRYING TO FOSTER A RELATIONSHIP -- A LOT OF TIMES WE JUST LAST NIGHT WE HAD A COMMUNITY BARBECUE THAT COMMUNITY BARBECUE -- FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE HAD THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE WITH US BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING. TO LET OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT -- YES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE JOB BUT THAT ISN'T JUST TO COME AND GET THE BAD GUYS IT'S ALSO BECOME AND TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T BAD THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE THERE TO HELP YOU -- SO I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST BEEN THAT TRYING TO FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS AND TAKING THE TIME THE EXTRA TIME TO DO THAT THANK YOU. SO LITTLE ABOUT YOU AS WELL. THIS UP AWESOME. CERTAINLY WILL ALLOW. IF YOU COULD COME UP TO THE MIKE JUST SO THAT. OKAY ALL OF OUR VIEWERS AT HOME START HERE. SORRY BUT NOT JUST ON ON THAT PART RIGHT THERE WHAT YOU ASKED IS IS I SAID ON THE HOUSING BOARD AS WELL AS A TRIBAL COUNCIL. ARM IS YOU KNOW IF IF THEY HAVE ANY KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO COME UP ON THE RANCHERIA INVESTIGATE. US IS IS BEING IN THERE ON ON OUR RENTAL UNITS THEY ARE FULL ACCESS IF YOU KNOW IF IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT IF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED THEIR WARNER SIMON THAT SINCE. WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THEM THERE AND LET A MAN IF IT IF IT COMES TO THAT POINT IT ALSO THAT'S THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM AS WELL. YOU KNOW SO IN AND WE HAVE ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY PLUS RENTAL HOMES UP ON THE UPPER AND LOWER RANCHERIA. SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER THE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE OUT OF CITY LIMITS ARE DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH THE CITY YOU KNOW POLICE OR WHATEVER SO. ANY OF THAT STUFF ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW WERE THE SAME THING YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT THAT STUFF ON A RANCHER IN ALL EITHER. ANY OF THAT SO THANK. GOOD IT SOUNDS LIKE JUST HAVING A GOOD RELATION WITH BECAUSE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT. BASICALLY TELLS THE TRIBE YOU HANDLE YOURSELF AND WHEN THEY NEED. TO ACTUALLY BE MORE PROACTIVE AND TAKE CARE OF IT AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP. ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE MORE PROACTIVE AND SO I JUST I DON'T HOLD UP.
