THESE PROFESSIONALS PLACE THEIR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE RESPOND TO TRAGEDIES SUCH AS THE RECENT SACRAMENTO MASS SHOOTING AND THE SHOOTING OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND AT A CHURCH IN ORANGE COUNTY. I KNOW WE'RE ALL PRAYING FOR THOSE INVOLVED IN THIS TRAGEDY AS WELL AS THE ONE WE HAD IN NEW YORK. AND JUST WEEKS AGO A LOS SOUNDED A CHPOFFICER USED HIS OWN PATROL VEHICLE TO COLLIDE WITH AND STOP A- HIGH SPEED ONE WAY DRIVER. IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL DANGER FACING EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL. THIS WORKFORCE FACES ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF OCCURRENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS. PAIRED WITH THE LOWEST LIKELIHOOD OF SEEKING TREATMENT. MANY OF THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST BUT THEIR SACRIFICE AND BRAVERY WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. THIS RESOLUTION COMMENDS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.

TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX AND THE CORPORATION ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES. THE PURPOSE OF AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX IS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO LGBTQ FAMILIES WISHING TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE FAMILY FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND TO REMOVE THE STATUTORY STIGMA ATTACHED TO THE LGBTQ FOSTER CHILDREN THANKS TO SIGNIFICANT REFORMS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE RECENT YEARS MORE MORE LGBTQ FAMILIES ARE SEEKING TO OFFER THEIR SERVICES AS RESOURCE FAMILIES WHICH PROVIDES OUT OF HOME CARE FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX WILL PROVIDE NEEDED PROTECTIONS BY PROHIBITING PLACING AGENCIES FROM DECLINING TO PLACE OUR FOSTER CHILD WITH THE RESOURCE FAMILY SOLELY ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RESOURCE FAMILY IDENTIFIES AS LGBTQ THIS BILL WILL ADDITIONALLY AND STATUTORY STIGMATA BY REMOVING THE TERM HARD TO PLACE CHILDREN FROM OUR STATE LAWS UNFORTUNATELY MANY LGBT Q.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN AWAIT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON AND OTHERS AND I PUTTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MISTER GIBSON EMAIL BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ON SIXTEEN OH EIGHT WHICH SEEKS TO SEPARATE CORNERS OFFICE. FROM SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND COUNTIES SUCH ACROSS THE STATE CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES THAT STILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO COMBINE THE OFFICE OF THE CORNERS AND THE SHARES. FOR YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED FAR TOO MANY TRAGEDIES. PATTERNS OF INCONSISTENCIES BECAUSE SHARES ARE ALLOWED TO OVERSEE THE CAUSE OF DEATH RULINGS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN BIAS MEDICAL INVESTIGATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT WE'LL PUT CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE STATES. THAT HAVE ALREADY ADVANCED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA TEN COUNTIES ALREADY ARE DOING WHAT A. B. SIXTEEN OH EIGHT SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH. HERE TODAY IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR ANGELO CANTIL A UNITED STATES NAVY VETERAN FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED BY POLICE MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH THE CAR COSTA COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT AFTER THE AUTOPSY AND THE RULING WAS THAT DEATH WAS AN ACCIDENT AND LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH UNDERSCORE THIS. EXCITED DELIRIUM THE TERM EXCITED DELIRIUM IS REJECTED COLLEAGUES BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN- PEDIATRICS OR ON SKEWS ME PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THIS TERM HAS BEEN REJECTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY YET IT IS STILL USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EXPLAIN ON CERTAIN DEATHS OCCURRING IN WITH AND WITH POLICE CUSTODY CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE A SHERIFF'S TO HAVE ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND OR CERTIFICATION TO ASSUME THE DUTIES OF A CORNERS AS A RESULT. IT HAS CAUSED MANY QUESTIONS WHETHER A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS IS BALLOT WIN WIN THERE IS AN OFFICER INVOLVED DEATH MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON MS BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MEMBERS AND MISTER SPEAKER I URGE YOUR AYE VOTES ON AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT I HAVE HELD IN MY ARMS THE MOTHER OF ANGELA TELL HER THIS. AT TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE DREADS THAT SHE EVER MADE THE CALL TO SEEK SUPPORT FOR HER BROTHER. AND WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT WE WHEN WE WANT THE BEST AND THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY. OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR OFFICERS ARE SHERIFFS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE DECISIONS THAT THE CORNER MAKES. SO IT IS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A SEPARATION IF YOU WILL FROM THE CORNER AND THE SHERIFF'S AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS BONTA DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PROUD JOINT CO AUTHOR OF AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT FAR TOO MANY TRAGEDIES AND PATTERNS OF AN INCONSISTENCY BECAUSE SHERIFFS ARE ALLOWED TO OVERSEE THE CAUSE OF DEATH RULINGS. UNFORTUNATELY OUT OF STATE IF THIS HAPPENED TO THE FAMILY OF ANGELO QUINTO WHO I MET WAS SHORTLY AFTER THE POLICE TRAGICALLY KILLED THEIR SON. IT TOOK OVER SEVEN MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH. BUT THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTER. CORNER TO ISSUE A REPORT SEVEN MONTHS. AND THAT'S WAS STATED THE REPORT WHICH RULED HIS DEATH AN ACCIDENT AND LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS EXCITED DELIRIUM. NOT A PHYSICIAN I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS AS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND SO I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS EXCITED DELIRIUM. AND YES IT IS A TERM THAT HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. AND AS I WAS REVIEWING SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS IT HAS SHOWN THAT EXCITED DELIRIUM IS MOST OFTEN THE RESULT OF POLICE AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF POLICE RESTRAINT. THAT'S WHEN IF YOU. AND SO IF WE SEPARATE THE CORONER'S OFFICE FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IT CREATES TRANSPARENCY NOT ONLY FOR THIS FAMILY BUT FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD TO INDOOR THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY. WE WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. AND IT ULTIMATELYGIVES THE FAMILIES THE PEACE WHEN THEIR LOVED ONE HAS PASSED AWAY. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT pMISTER CAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE- IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO REPRESENTS CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I ADD ON TO WHAT YOU HEARD MARK CALLING FROM SAN DIEGO. WHICH IS NOT ONLY WERE THERE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY A COLLEAGUE OF OURS WHO'S A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT DOESN'T HAVE FAITH IN THE OUTCOMES OF THESE AUTOPSIES. AND THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS REASON TO SUPPORT THIS BILL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US SHOULD WANT OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE FAITH IN THE PROCESS SEIZE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO LOST A LOVED ONE. AND WHEN I HEAR FROM MY OWN COMMUNITY THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT OFFICE BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. AND SO WE NEED TO CORRECT THIS AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PROCESSES THAT ARE SEPARATE TRUSTWORTHY AND GIVE OUR COMMUNITY A BELIEF THAT OUR PROCESS EASIER JUST AND EVERYONE IS GETTING THE OUTCOME THAT THEY DESERVE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. AND OUR COLLEAGUES FROM LA'S BILL WILL CHANGE THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYBODY'S SUPPORT. THANK MISS AMERICA. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER GIBSON YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR LENDING THEIR VOICES IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT AGAIN THIS BILL IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY- LOS ANGELES COUNTY- HAD A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE SHERIFF'S OVERSAW THE CORONER'S OFFICE THEY SEPARATED SO IT SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT SAN DIEGO AND MANY OTHER- COUNTIES HAVE TAKEN SIMILAR STEPS.
