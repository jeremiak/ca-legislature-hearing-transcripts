OKAY MISTER GRAYSON IS TO GO FIRST SO WE'RE GOING TO FILE AND THREE AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE MISTER GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER TECH FOR ALLOWING HIM TO GO FIRST. AND THE DICES YOURS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SERVICES CONSTRUCTING FOR ALLOWING ME TO STEP THEN I'VE GOT ANOTHER BILL TO PRESENT ANOTHER COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WHICH WILL ALLOW QUALIFIED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO BE EFFECTIVELY USE OR TO EFFECTIVELY USE THE STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS. ESTABLISHED BY SB THIRTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXASPERATED CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING HOUSING CRISIS AS SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS LEAVE MANY UN. UNABLE TO AFFORD HOUSING AND ON THE BRINK OF EVICTION. SB THIRTY FIVE WAS A LANDMARK EFFORT TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING SUPPLY. IT'S STREAMLINED THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR QUALIFYING HOUSING PROJECTS IN LOCALITIES THAT FAILED TO MEET THEIR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS. ASSESSMENT GOALS HOWEVER SINCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION AMBIGUITIES IN SB THIRTY FIVES LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED TO DE RAIL DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE MAKES THREE CLARIFYING CHANGES. ABOUT TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGING ISSUES FIRST IT ALLOWS FOR MODEST MODIFICATIONS TO AN SB THIRTY FIVE PROJECT WITHOUT REQUIRING THE DEVELOPER TO APPLY FOR A NEW PROJECT APPROVAL. SECOND IT REFINES THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR CONNECTING AND SB THIRTY FIVE PROJECT TO EXISTING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LASTLY AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE CLARIFIES THAT THE TWO THIRD RESIDENTIAL REQUIREMENT IN SB THIRTY FIVE APPLIES TO. OBJECT ITSELF NOT THE ZONING FOR THE SITE THAT THE PROJECT IS BUILT ON WITH THESE CHANGES AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT QUALIFYING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY STREAMLINED AS INTENDED UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE. I DO HAVE A WITNESS- MISTER CHAIRMAN- MY WITNESSES MICHAEL LANE WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PLANNING AND URBAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION. THANK THANK YOU THIS TIME I LIKE TO ASK THE OPERATOR TO PLEASE ALLOW THE FIRST AND ONE WITNESS MISTER MICHAEL LANE TO TESTIFY BY TELEPHONE. YOU'RE CUTE NUMBERS HI MICHAEL IN HERE WAS BURKE. SB THIRTY FIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALLOWS BECAUSE THEY WANTED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL ZONING. AND IT IS BETTER TO THE JURISDICTIONS NOT PARTICIPATION HOUSING A VERY SAD TIME LEVELS CALLED FOR ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LAW WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION. ON TECHNICAL CLEAN UP TO ENSURE THAT APPLICATION OF THE LAW ALIGNS WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL INCLUDES THREE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION. ONE MINOR DESIGN MODIFICATIONS ARE ALLOWED AS LONG AS OBJECTIVE. STANDARDS CONTINUE TO BE MET. TO THE NECESSARY OFFLINE IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED TO EMPLOY AND THAT'S THIRTY FIVE FOUR. BUT BE APPROVED. AND THREE TO TWO THIRDS RESIDENTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT. AND NOT THE SITE RESOUNDING. MIXED USE ON COMMERCIAL ZONES THAT ALLOW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS COULD NOT TYPICALLY REQUIRE. A TWO THIRDS OF THE SITE BE DEDICATED TO A RESIDENTIAL USE. THESE TARGET CLARIFICATIONS PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUTE FOR BOTH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND DEVELOPERS. AND ENSURE THE PROMISE THAT LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF SB THIRTY FIVE. CAN PEOPLE FILLED WITH RESPECTIVE REQUEST AND I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS TIME LET'S OPEN THE LINE UP TO ANY.

BUT WE MUST PUT IN TEMPORARY PROTECTIONS TO GET US THROUGH THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS. WITHOUT A WAVE OF EVICTIONS. MILLIONS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN OUR STATE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. WE CAN'T ALLOW OBJECTIONS TO RESUME. FOR STILL VERY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE. OF A PUBLIC HEALTH. PANDEMIC THIS BILL WILL NOT PREVENT EVERY FICTIONAL FOR CLOSURE.

NINETY JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS BILL. INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING TENANTS. PROGRESSIVE EQUITY AND LABOR INTERESTS. I WANT TO THANK FROM THE INDUSTRY TO CALIFORNIA PARDON ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. OF REALTORS THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION THE BANKING COMMUNITY. AND MANY COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH HOUSES OF THIS LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WILL DO A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST FOR TENANTS. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT NO OBJECTIONS FOR MISS RENT CAN GO FOR AGAINST TENANTS WITH COVERT HARDSHIPS FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS. UNTIL FEBRUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TENANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC HARDSHIP THE PREVENTS THEM FROM PAYING RENT ON TIME. ONCE ATTENDED ESTABLISHES AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP THEY CAN'T BE EVICTED FOR RENT PAYMENTS OR MISTER IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THE COVERED PANDEMIC. IT WILL STILL OWE THE FULL AMOUNT TO THEIR LANDLORD AND THEY COULD BE SUED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO LOSE THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE OF MYSTERY. FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS THE TRANSITION TIME PERIOD WHICH WOULD START TOMORROW. SEPTEMBER FIRST THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY NEXT YEAR. IF RUNNERS COMPETE AT LEAST 25% OF THE RENT DUE EACH MONTH. DURING THE TIME UNTIL JUNE OR THE THIRTY FIRST. THAN ANY REMAINING MYSTERY FROM THIS TIME PERIOD WILL BE CONVERTED. TO CONSUMER DEBT. AND TENANTS WILL BE PROTECTED FROM EVER BEING AFFECTED DUE TO THE RESTAURANT. THIS BILL ALSO PROTECTS TENANTS. BY EXTENDING THE NORMAL THREE DAY PAYER QUIT PERIOD. BEGINS INTERACTION TO FIFTEEN DAYS GIVING TENANTS CRUCIAL TIME. TO RESPOND TO INFECTION NOTICE. IT ALSO PRESERVES PROTECTIONS CREATED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES. BY ENSURING THAT EXISTING ORDINANCES ARE GRANDFATHERED IN. AND CAN CONTINUE UNTIL THEY EXPIRE. ADDITIONALLY ONE STATE WHAT PROTECTIONS AND ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NEW LOCAL MEASURES CAN TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. FINALLY THIS BILL EXTENDS HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHT PROTECTIONS TO SMALL LANDLORDS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM FROM FORECLOSURE AND ENSURE THAT MORTGAGE SERVICERS WORK WITH BARS ON LOAN MODIFICATION OPTIONS AT THIS TIME. LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER CHU I WILL GO TO OUR FIRST WITNESS.

RIGHT THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ON ALL OR ON BEHALF OF BUT YOUR PROPERTY CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- AS MR CHIU SAID THE BILL BEFORE YOU PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY RENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN DURING THE ON GOING TO THE PANDEMIC. IT NEEDS A PATH AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO THE LOOMING OF ACTION CRISIS NOR IS IT A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE VERY REAL FINANCIAL IMPACT THE. PANDEMIC IS HAVING ON TENANTS. FOLLOW AND LARGE ANNA FOR HOUSING. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE PRIMARY THAT HELD BACK THE TIDAL WAVE OF THE SECTION COMING FROM THE FRONT SHUT DOWN OVER THE GUARD HOTMEDIA COVE IS THE PULSE KEEP IT PUT IN PLACE BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ONE. THAT WILL WILL BE REPEALED TOMORROW ADDICTION OTHER THAN THOSE FOR NON PAYMENT WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FOR TURNING ON WEDNESDAY DESPITE THE FACT THAT MUCH OF THE STATE REMAIN SHUT DOWN AS WE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE DEADLY DISEASE. BUT MOST LIKELY THE IMPACT BY THE THIRD. INCOME BLACK BROWN RENTERS THE VERY PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE COOK A CRISIS EMPIRE STATE ENTRANCE HOUSING CRISIS. THIS TOO MUST BE ATTRACTIVE FOR TO AVOID A CATASTROPHE. IT REMAINS OUR FIRM POSITION THAT ALLOWING ANY OTHER ACTIONS TO PROCEED AT THE TIME OTHER THAN THE NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE INTERESTS AND CONTRARY TO PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WHILE YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD EIGHTY THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WE URGE YOU TO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO DONE ON THIS ISSUE. THANK.

WHILE YOU'VE ALL HEARD OPPOSITION ON PREVIOUS COPA NINETEEN BILLS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR POSITION THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE HELP. FOR TENANTS TRULY AFFECTED BY COVER NINETEEN AS WELL AS COMPENSATION FOR LANDLORDS. SHOULD OF MOM AND POP OWNERS WHO ARE RISK UPON CLOSURE OR THOSE WHO DEPEND UPON THE RENT TO COVER THEIR RETIREMENT. AND MANY OF THESE OWNERS HAVE NOT RECEIVED RENT FOR MONTHS. THOSE OF US WHO CAME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE INPUT ON AB THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT AND MET IT'S NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION AND EVERYONE INVOLVED WOULD HAVE WANTED MORE FOR THEIR MEMBERS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS. HOWEVER DOING NOTHING WAS NOT THE ANSWER. WE ALL KNOW THAT TO TRULY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP UP COBIT IMPACTED RENTERS NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THEY CAN PAY THEIR RENT. IF IT CONTINUES TO GO IN PAID WE FEAR. THAT HOUSING PROVIDERS WILL EITHER FACE FOR CLOSE. OR IF THEY CAN'T SELL THEY WILL FAIL OR CONVERT THEIR PROPERTIES. THAT MAY MEAN TENANTS LOSE THEIR HOMES IN THE END. THE SMALLER PROPERTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LUDIC LOSING THESE UNITS ARE WORTH AND CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. AS LAWLER STATED EARLIER IT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. AND WE COMMIT TO CONTINUE OUR WORK TO FIND A BETTER SOLUTION FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY COBIT OWNERS AND TENANTS ALIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

THE CAN I GET A FEW IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO. AND THERE IS NO ONE HERE. THANK YOU MODERATOR. MEMBER COMMITTEE WILL TURN TO COMMITTEE NUMBER COMMENTS QUESTIONS A MINIMUM OF. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR- AND AS A SOMEONE WHO WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH ARCHER DURING THIS BILL- I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORK IN THE SOCKS IN THE CONVERSATION THE DIALOGUE THAT WENT INTO THIS- I THINK THAT- AND HAS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE PREVIOUS. WITNESSES IN BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION THIS BILL DOES NOT SOLVE EVERY SINGLE. TENANT LANDLORD HOUSING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT PRESENTS THE ONLY VEHICLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. SULFUR EVERYTHING IT DOES CREATE A BETTER OPTION THAN NO OPTION THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT'S THE DOES OF THE TWO THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN FRONT OF US WE EITHER HAVE NO INACTION WHICH MEANS MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS- COULD BE LEFT WITHOUT A HOME- STARTING. IN A FEW DAYS OR WE VOTE ON A MEASURE THAT REQUIRES THAT WE CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE BUT IT DOES HELP A PORTION OF THOSE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS SO I WANT I THINK- ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED I KNOW THAT- CERTAINLY- WE HEARD THAT THERE'S MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT COMES AHEAD. AND AS WE TRY TO PREDICT THE UNKNOWN WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT IS COMING BEFORE S. AND SO I ABSOLUTELY EXPECT THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND THAT WE WILL BE BACK- WHEN THE LATE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE RECONVENES TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESSING ASSESS WHAT'S WORKED WHAT HASN'T. I'M CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT ON THE BANKING AND FINANCE SIDE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- WE WILL NEED TO DO MORE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS HOMEOWNERS. AND LANDLORDS- ON THAT PARTICULAR SIDE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED THE CONVERSATIONS AND THANK ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED- BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE OPTIONS IN FRONT OF US ARE EITHER IN ACTION WHICH MEANS THERE IS. NOTHING WE WILL DO OR WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL- AS THE ONLY OCT LEGISLATIVE OPTION AT THE MOMENT- THAT WILL STILL HELP SOME EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SOLVE EVERY SINGLE. CHALLENGE WE HAVE UPON US TO THINK YOU. ASSEMBLY IS AMONG. SURE IS EXCELLENT. AND THERE IS NO MOTIONS ARE SECOND. TO SET. WE HAVE A SECOND OR A THIRD OF A MOTION GABRIEL MEMBERS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS LEGISLATION. IF YOU GET. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE YOU KNOW. FOR ONE SIDE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP THAT ARE RENTERS ALL TENANTS ARE GOING THROUGH- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO KNOW A LOT OF. US PROPERTY OWNERS WHO MAY JUST HAVE A COUPLE UNITS- AND THEY STILL HAVE A MORTGAGE THAT THEY NEED TO CARRY. AND. SO. I'M NOT SURE WHY WHERE I WILL BE ON OF THIS BILL I WANT TO COME TO THE FLOOR BUT IN COMMITTEE I WILL- OF THING AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE- THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION'S- FOR. COMING TO THE TABLE. AND COME BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE- A SOLUTION THAT THEY THINK. IS THE MOST RARE THEY THEY CAN WORK WITH BETWEEN TENANTS AND- AND LANDLORDS SO WITH THAT THANK YOU- MR FOR ALLOWING ME TO SEE IF YOU WERE SOMETHING THEY DESERVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH TO MAKE COMMENTS. I JUST LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO OUR COMMITTEE CHAIR OF FOR HIS EXCEPTIONAL KICKS IN. A WORK ON THIS ITEM I KNOW THAT T WAS A LOT AS WELL AS THE ANOTHER MEMBER COMMITTEE AND CHAIR THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE AND IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING FORWARD SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE. I THINK WE ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A STATE. I PERSONALLY THINK I THINK THIS PILOT IS THE GREEK- NATIONAL SOLUTION I WOULD BE FAR PREFERABLE- AND THE COMPLETE AND TOTAL LACK OF LEADERSHIP CERTAINLY COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER PLCES IN WASHING DC. ARE WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE IT UPON OURSELVES TO FIGURE OUT A REASONABLE SOLUTION OF WHICH THIS IS A YOU SEE A DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HOUSING COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER. HOW TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT OR AT LEAST A PARTICIPATION IN A REASONABLE SOLUTION- I THINK WE THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD DO IS TO BRING A DIFFERENT SIDES TOGETHER. TO COME UP WITH PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS PARTICULARLY IN SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME SO. I TO OUR CHAIR OF MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU SIR- WELL AGAIN AND IN PERFECT SOLUTION IT DOES PROVIDE A LEVEL OF SUPPORT- THE CALIFORNIA WON'T HAVE ABSENT ACTION BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS HOUSE TODAY- AND AGAIN WE CAN KEEP OUR- HOPE. THAT THEY'LL BE SOME LEVEL OF TRUE SOLUTIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THIS IS A NATIONAL ISSUE. AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NATIONAL ACTION BUT ABSENT THAT- IF THIS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LEAD CALIFORNIA WILL- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS LEGISLATION MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO. ADVISE. YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU CLOSING. THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES REALLY PRE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS AS YOU KNOW THIS WAS MANY OF RAW THE CLOCK. ON A FACT MIGHT JOIN AUTHOR THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE WORK THAT OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES DID ARE MANY CO AUTHORS INCLUDING OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO'S ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY- AND JUST SAY THIS IS A TEMPORARY STOPGAP MEASURE WE KNOW. WE ARE PUT INTO PLACE- A SET OF POLICIES FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS BUT WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR THE PANDEMIC THE RECESSION AND WHETHER THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ENGAGE IN HOPEFULLY WHAT I THINK OF AS THE LONGER TERM ULTIMATE SOLUTION TO THIS- AND THIS BILL IS FAR FROM PERFECT WE HAVE MORE THINGS THAT WE CERTAINLY WILL NEED TO THINK ABOUT BUT AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA PUT IT- THE CHOICE WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS TO DO NOTHING OR TO DO SOMETHING. AND WE CANNOT DO NOTHING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.
