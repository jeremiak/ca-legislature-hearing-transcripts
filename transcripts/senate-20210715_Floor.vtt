CERTAINLY. THE THE FULL

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.390
REGULATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:05.093
DEVELOPED YET AND CLEARLY THE-

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.663
AND ONCE THEY- ARE. THEN THE

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:08.730
CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT APPLY

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.233
CAN SPECIFY HOWEVER WE HAVE

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.135
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE PRIORITY

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.007
THAT YOU REFERENCED WHICH OUR-

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:19.441
FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:22.911
TRANSITIONING OUT. AND WHO WHO

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:25.380
AND LEX I KNOW THAT- THE

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.749
SENATOR. FROM THE SENATE THE

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.284
READING AREA UNDERSTANDS THIS

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.053
BUT SOME OF OUR OTHER MEMBERS

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.388
MAY NOT THAT WHEN YOU ARE IF

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.756
YOU'RE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM UP

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:36.491
TO A CERTAIN AGE. YOU ARE

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.961

YOU TRANSITION OUT. WELL WE

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.098
HAVE SOME SUPPORT SERVICES

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:44.499
BASICALLY YOU'RE KIND OF JUST

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.635

SYSTEMS OUR FOSTR YOUTH DO

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:54.443
NOT. AND SO IT MAKES SENSE. I

WHO WERE CONVICTED FOR DEADLY

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:22.089
ACTIONS OF THEIR ABUSERS WHILE

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:23.858
SURVIVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:26.327
MEMBERS I REPRESENT TO PRISONS

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.997

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:30.598
WOMEN'S PRISON IN CHINO MEN'S

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:31.365
PRISON. I'VE LIVED THERE MY

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:32.700
WHOLE LIFE AND WE ALWAYS JUST

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.468
SAW THE PRISONS AND IT WAS JUST

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.303
PART OF THE LANDSCAPE. ONCE I

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.838
BECAME ELECTED I STARTED TO

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:39.373
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE THINGS

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.674
THAT WERE REALLY HAPPENING

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:42.510
THERE. AND I WOULD INVITE ANY

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.178

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.484
MANY OF THESE GOLDEN GIRLS HAVE

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:52.319
FALL FALL UNDER L. WALKER IN

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.421

SEVENTIES SOME EVEN IN THE

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:57.124
EARLY EIGHTIES. AND IT'S BEEN

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.193
ALMOST A LIFETIME IN JAIL.

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:02.430
UNDER THIS. THIS LAW. SO IF

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.798
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET SOME OF THEM

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.066
AND UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOULD

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.567
HAVE HELPED THEM SO MUCH I'M

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:08.436
HAPPY TO SET THAT UP. THE MOST

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.904
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TODAY

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:13.340
IS VOTE HI ON SB THREE HUNDRED.

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:18.012

OPPOSE THE BILL AND REQUEST

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.485
THAT MANY OF YOU CONSIDER A

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:28.355
NOBLE. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:29.723
AND JUSTICE INCLUDES THE

01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:33.961
VICTIMS. NOW A LATER ON BETTER

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.563
THE FELONY MURDER RULE HAS

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:39.800
PERFECT. AND INDEED IT DOESN'T

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.869
MEAN THE ONE THAT SIMPLY PULLED

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:44.805
THE TRIGGER. THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.874
UNDER WHICH A LOT OF THESE

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.742
HEINOUS CRIMES OCCUR. A WELL

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:52.913
PLANNED. MAYBE ON SOME RARE

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.381
OCCASION THERE'S AN ADVERT AN

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:56.784

RIDE IF YOU WILL. BUT I

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:04.158
REVIEWED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:04.692
OF THESE CASES LADIES AND

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:07.862

HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING THERE

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:25.012
REALLY IS NO SUCH THING AS THAT

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:27.915

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:38.392
CAN CHANGE THAT INDIVIDUAL. FOR

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:40.728
EXAMPLE WE HAVE A DEATH PENALTY

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:45.232
IN CALIFORNIA. BY THE VOTERS

SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU

DIEGO SENATOR JOEL ANDERSON.

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:20.327
AND HE CO AUTHORED THE BILL

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:22.162
WITH ME BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.732
FUNDAMENTALLY THAT OUR FELONY

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:29.136
MURDER LAW. WAS UNFAIR. AND

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:32.273
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN. YOU CAN BE

THE MURDER. CAN BE CHARGED WITH

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.379
FIRST DEGREE MURDER. AND THEN

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:47.788
LOWER SENTENCE ANY PERSON WHO.

I DID NOT COMMIT THE MURDER DID

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:53.093
NOT PLAN THE MURDER DID NOT

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.396
HIRE SOMEONE TO DO THE MURDER

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.364
DID NOT ORCHESTRATE THE MURDER.

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.999
BUT UNDER THE FELONY MURDER

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:01.168
RULE YOU COULD RECEIVE A HIGHER

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.536
SENTENCE NUMBER SPECIAL

DURING TEES BUT YOU GET THAT

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:10.444
SENTENCE THE JUDGE HAS NO

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:12.346
DISCRETION WHATSOEVER. MURDER

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:14.581
IN THE FIRST DEGREE THE JUDGE

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.850
HAS SOME DISCRETION. WHICH IS

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:18.986
WHY THE JUDGE FACTORS THINGS

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:21.922
THAT RELATED TO THE MURDER AND

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:24.058
WHY THERE ARE SOME FOLKS MURDER

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:25.192
IN THE FIRST DEGREE YOU DO NOT

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:27.261
HAVETHE SAME SENTENCE. AS

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.430
THOSE WHO GET CHARGED WITH

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.665
THIS. SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:35.135
RUSSIAN ROULETTE. BUT YOU. YOU

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.604
CAN I MEAN IT'S I'M GOING TO

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:39.773
MAKE A TERRIBLE ANALOGY BUT IN

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.041
A WEIRD WAY YOU'VE BEEN BETTER

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:43.777
OFF TO BE THE ACTUAL MURDER WE

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:44.311
DO NOT WANT TO INCENTIVIZE

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:51.085
MURDER. AND THIS ALLOWS BGA THE

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:56.457
DEFENSE. THE VICTIM'S FAMILY.

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:58.992
HOWEVER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:01.995
PERSON'S ROLE IN THE CRIME IS

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:04.932
WHAT'S CONSIDERED INDENT THE

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.134
SENTENCING IT DOES NOT LET

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:09.670
PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK IT DOES NOT.

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:13.540
AND THERE IS AN IRONY FOR AN

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:16.777
ILL LOGIC IN A PENAL CODE THAT

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:20.013
ALLOWS THE FIRST DEGREE MURDER

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.282
TO BE SENTENCED AT A LOWER

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:24.585
SENTENCE THEN THE PERSON UNDER

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:25.886
THIS FELONY MURDER SPECIAL

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:28.489
CIRCUMSTANCES SO THIS IS AN

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:32.059
IMPORTANT THING TO CORRECT AND

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.160
YOU MIGHT SAY WELL RIGHT.

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.062
SENATOR FROM BERKELEY WHY DID

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:38.532
YOU NOT PUT THAT IN FOURTEEN

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:39.433
THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE PASSED THE

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.568
AUTHOR POINTED OUT. THE

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:43.637
CORRECTION OF THIS SPECIAL

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.939
CIRCUMSTANCE SITUATION BECAUSE

01:40:46.006 --> 01:40:47.708
OF A PROPOSITION REQUIRES THE

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.710
TWO THIRDS VOTE WHICH IS A HARD

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:53.814
BLOW TO GET. AND SO. I

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:56.750
INTRODUCED MY BILL WITH ONLY

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.585
ADDRESSING THE PORTION THAT

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:00.954
WASN'T IMPACTED BY THAT BECAUSE

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:03.257
I WANTED TO REALLY HAVE I

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:04.858
WANTED THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.360
A FULL DEBATE AND TO FULLY

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.462
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL ANY MURDER

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:10.931
RULE I'M NOT A LAWYER I DIDN'T

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:13.534
GO TO LAW SCHOOL SO I HAD NO

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.603
IDEA WHEN. AS I VISITED PRISONS

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.572
AND LEARNED ABOUT THESE

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:20.707
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.810
NO IDEA THAT YOU COULD HAVE

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.711
SUCH A MINIMAL ROLE IN THE

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:27.047
CRIME AND YET RECEIVE A HIGHER

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:30.083
SENTENCE THAN THE ACTUAL MURDER.

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.685
AND SO UNDERSTANDING AND I'M

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.287
SURE MANY OF ALL OF YOU DID

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.422
NOT. THOSE OF YOU ATTENDED LAW

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.291
SCHOOL MAY UNDERSTAND IT WELL

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.959
BUT THOSE OF YOU DIDN'T I'M

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:39.526
SURE DOES IT WOULDN'T EVEN

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:41.562
OCCUR TO YOU. AND IN FACT WHEN

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:42.896
I SPOKE TO MY FAMILY AND

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:45.933
FRIENDS ABOUT MY BILL FOURTEEN

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:48.502
THIRTY SEVEN. THEY WERE ALSO

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:50.771
BLOWN AWAY THAT YOU THE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.840
CALIFORNIA HAD SUCH A LAW THAT

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:54.942
COULD SHOW DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:59.513
THREE. B. THE PERSON IN IN IN

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.514
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME.

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:03.317
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:05.152
WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS BILL

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:08.956
ONLY COVERS THOSE PEOPLE

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:10.057
CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:12.659
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHO DID

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:15.395
NOT KILL. WHO DID NOT INTEND TO

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:17.364
KILL WHO DID NOT PLAN THE

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.833
MURDER WHO DID NOT HIRE SOMEONE

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.401
TO MURDER. WE DID NOT

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.403
COORDINATE THAT MURDER. AND

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.706
CHAU ORCHESTRATED. SO I JUST

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:26.607
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:29.343
FULLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT THIS

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:32.813
WOULD HAPPEN NERO APPLICATION.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.181
AND WITHOUT AYE ELSEVIER AYE

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:39.553
VOTE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK

YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:43.190
STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.692
COMMON SENSE MEASURE IF THIS IS

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.127
REALLY ABOUT JUSTICE IT WOULD

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:49.029
BE JUST US BLACK AND BROWN

OF THE TRIAL THE ACTUAL

01:47:44.357 --> 01:47:46.359
SENTENCING HEARING AND REALLY

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:46.960

CRIMINAL INTENT AS THE OTHER

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:03.677
PARTICIPANTS PERHAPS- IN THIS

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:06.246
MURDER. WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.547
TO TAKE THAT CONFUSION OF THE

01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:09.449
BILL AND MAKE WHAT I JUST SAID

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.518
EXPRESSED IN THE BILL- YOU HAVE

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:14.154
MY COMMITMENT THAT WILL DO

THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:16.790
THAT REALLY GOES TO MY SECOND

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:17.390
QUESTION BECAUSE IN THE BILL

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:20.327
ITSELF. HI THIS IS ON PAGE

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:21.294
THREE LINE SIXTEEN IT SAYS

01:48:21.361 --> 01:48:23.663
THIS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.132
LEGISLATURE. TO LIMIT THE

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:28.034
APPLICATION. OF SPECIAL

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:31.638
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACCOMPLISH IS.

01:48:31.705 --> 01:48:33.807
WHO ACTED WITH INTENT TO KILL.

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:35.442
SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE

01:48:35.508 --> 01:48:37.010
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NOW SO

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:39.212
COULD YOU LARIFY THAT LANGUAGE

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:39.846
THAT IN REGARD TO WHAT YOU JUST

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.815
PREVIOUSLY SAID IN A IN IN

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.316
BASED ON WHAT MY COMMITMENT

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:46.219
JUST WAS- AT THE RISK OF TRYING

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:48.889
TO AMEND THE BILL- WITH EXACT

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.857
LANGUAGE TODAY I DON'T. I'M

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:52.592
PROBABLY NOT QUALIFIED TO DO

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:54.527
THAT. WITH THAT LANGUAGE. THAT

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:57.731
LIMITATION- IS REALLY AN

01:48:57.797 --> 01:48:59.833
EXPANSION IT MEANS THE WORDING

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.502
IS TO BE CHANGED TO ALLOW- THE

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:05.071
JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IN THOSE

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.973
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.075
CRIMINAL INTENT ROSE TO THE

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:09.476
LEVEL. OF RECKLESS

01:49:09.542 --> 01:49:11.478
INDIFFERENCE. YEAH IT'S JUST

01:49:11.544 --> 01:49:12.612
NOT THE DANGER ANSWER THAT'S ON

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.447
SENTENCING NOW YES THAT

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:15.849
LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO ONLY

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.417
APPLY TO SENTENCING NOT THE

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:19.486
PROSECUTION. THAT'S CORRECT

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.921
VERY GOOD AND ONE FINAL.

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:23.189
QUESTION IF I MAY. THAT IF THE

01:49:23.256 --> 01:49:26.459
JUDGE AND THIS IS A JUDGE- IN

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:27.961
REAL TIME GOING FORWARD IF YOU

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:30.030
CLARIFIED THAT THE START DATE.

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:31.898
OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWO.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:33.500
BUT IF THE JUDGE IN THOSE

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.936
CIRCUMSTANCES GOING FORWARD.

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:36.569
WERE TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:40.874
THAT THAT. STANDARD THAT WE'RE

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:41.374
GONNA BE ELIMINATING AS

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:42.108
APPLICABLE. WHAT IS THE MINIMUM

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:43.944
THAT I JUDGE COULD- SENTENCE

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.513
THAT INDIVIDUAL TO. WEAR THOSE

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:48.548
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ARISE. MY

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:51.384
UNDERSTANDING IS AGAIN THERE

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:51.885
WOULD STILL BE A MURDER

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:53.620
CONVICTION AT THAT POINT. AS

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:57.257
YOU AS- AS YOU GO INTO THE

01:49:57.324 --> 01:49:58.925
SENTENCING PHASE OF THE TRIAL

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.393
IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.429
WOULD TYPICALLY BE. A MINIMUM

01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:04.197
OF TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE BUT WITH

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:06.967
THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. OKAY

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:09.669
AND FINALLY I APPRECIATE AGAIN

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.138
YOUR CLARIFICATION. IF THE

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.676
UTILITIES THAT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:45.744
YOU CAN'T JUST CAN SIMPLY TELL

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:48.013

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:50.549
WHEN I ASKED YOU. TO GIVE ME A

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:53.552
SOLUTION. NOT ONE OF THEM COULD

02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:55.420
TELL YOU THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY

02:14:55.487 --> 02:14:57.889
MR DALLEY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO

02:14:57.956 --> 02:14:59.825
GET THE LAST MILE. AND THE

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:01.993
DONUT HOLES AND THE PEOPLE THAT

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.296
ARE UNSERVED IN CALIFORNIA.

02:15:04.362 --> 02:15:05.530
THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:08.233
NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL.

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:10.135
WE'RE GONNA CAN CAN YOU TO SEE.

02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:11.770
MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO FINE TUNE

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:14.473
IT. AND I WILL BE WATCHING

02:15:14.539 --> 02:15:16.341
THAT. AND MANY OF YOU'VE HEARD

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:17.843
ME SPEAK ABOUT THE DEBT IN THIS

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:21.680
COUNTRY. AND WHAT THE FUTURE

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:24.816
LOOKS LIKE FOR OUR CHILDREN.

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:27.419
I'VE BEEN HERE NINE YEARS. AND

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:28.186
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET

02:15:28.253 --> 02:15:30.355
INTERNET FOR MY COMMUNITIES

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:32.557
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE STATE

02:15:32.624 --> 02:15:34.226
WE CAN EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN WE

02:15:34.292 --> 02:15:36.728
CAN HELP OUR OUR LAW

02:15:36.795 --> 02:15:37.295
ENFORCEMENT WE CAN HELP OUR

02:15:37.362 --> 02:15:39.831
FIRE COMMUNITIES WE CAN HELP

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:42.334
OUR HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS OR

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.036
LIBRARIES AND WE HAVE NOT GOT

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:45.670
ANYTHING EVEN THOUGH WE PUT THE

02:15:45.737 --> 02:15:49.040
MONEY UP. SO MORE SO I WANT TO

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:50.909
SHARE THIS IS INVESTMENT. I

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:52.577
BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE IT'S

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:53.144
GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HARD

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:54.613
WORK TO DO IT RIGHT. AND I'M

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:56.715
GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY.

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:59.551
BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF HEARING

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:02.687
FROM UTILITIES AND THOSE WHO.

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:03.955
ALWAYS CRITICIZE WHAT THE

02:16:04.022 --> 02:16:06.057
LEGISLATURE DOES. BUT DOESN'T

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:09.094
HAVE A SOLUTION. AND WHEN THEY

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.196
SAY THEY WANT A SOLUTION. AND

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:12.664
WE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:16:12.731 --> 02:16:13.899
MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE THEY DON'T

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:18.503
TAKE IT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:20.739
WILL BE VOTING TO GET INTERNET.

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:21.840
AND BROADBAND TO OUR

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:23.141
COMMUNITIES THAT DESPERATELY

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:25.410
NEED IT AND IF ANYTHING ELSE

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:27.812
WE'VE SEEN DURING THIS TIME.

02:16:27.879 --> 02:16:29.447
DURING THE PANDEMIC HOW

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.650

JUST THE ROLE PART OF

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.252

02:16:48.266 --> 02:16:49.935
SOLUTION I DON'T BELIEVE IN

DIGITAL ERA WE- BROAD IS

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:42.787
CRITICAL RIGHT. NOW THAT'S A

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.556
JOKE BUT THE TRANSLATION OF

THAT IS WE NEED THIS BILL

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:47.626
BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR

02:17:47.692 --> 02:17:48.994
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.229
HAVE HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:53.098
DEALING WITH INTERNET SERVICE

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.466
DEALING WITH BROADBAND SERVICE

02:17:54.532 --> 02:17:55.800
THAT CUTS OUT THAT IS

02:17:55.867 --> 02:17:58.536
INCONSISTENT- THAT IS FRIED THE

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:00.972
HEADS OF THE HAIRS OF PROBABLY

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.307
ALMOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN

02:18:02.374 --> 02:18:03.675
CALIFORNIA AND WHEN WE ARE

02:18:03.742 --> 02:18:05.143
STRUGGLING WITH THE KINDS OF

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:07.045
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING

02:18:07.112 --> 02:18:09.147
IN THIS STATE. CONNECTIVITY

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:13.918
ACTUALLY BECOMES. LIFE SAVING.

02:18:13.985 --> 02:18:15.654
I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.921
BILL AND I SHARED THIS WITH OUR

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:18.456
BUDGET HERE BECAUSE I SEE THIS

02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:20.625
IS OUR MODERN DAY WPA IT'S A

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:22.327
MODERN DAY WORKS PROGRESS

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:24.429
ADMINISTRATION BILL IT CREATES

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:26.965
JOBS IT UPGRADES AND IT BUILDS

02:18:27.032 --> 02:18:29.334
OF NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:31.436
CONNECTIVITY FOR EVERYONE AND

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:33.738
IT CREATES TANGIBLE OUTCOMES

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:35.607
WITH ACCOUNTABILITY BUMPERS.

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:38.343
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALL OF US ARE

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.645
FRUSTRATED FROM LIVING IN A

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:44.315
MODERN TIME WHERE YOU CANNOT

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:47.652
HAVE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO JOBS

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:50.789
EDUCATION TO HEALTHCARE TO

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:52.724
EMERGENCY CALLS. JUST CHECKING

02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:54.159
INTO YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:57.228
FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS. WHEN

02:18:57.295 --> 02:19:00.432
CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO SEE THAT

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:03.101
WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:05.203
BROADBAND IN TACKLING THIS

02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:06.504
ISSUE AND I THINK THIS

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:08.406
CATAPULTS US INTO THE SERIOUS

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:11.342
CLUB LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:12.310
THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:13.878
KNOW THIS ISSUE IS FLUID AND I

02:19:13.945 --> 02:19:15.180
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:16.981
HAVE BEEN HONEST ABOUT THAT AS

02:19:17.048 --> 02:19:19.384
TECHNOLOGY AS POPULATIONS AS

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:22.220
CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:24.689
A BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:27.192
IS ALSO ADAPTIVE. WHICH IS WHY

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.127
I ALSO AGREE THAT HAVING THE

02:19:29.194 --> 02:19:31.796
CZAR AND HAVING THE COUNCIL IS

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:34.265
OH SO APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE IT

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:35.467
SHOWS THAT WHILE WE ARE MAKING

02:19:35.533 --> 02:19:36.968
A STRONG AND DECLARATIVE

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:38.236
STATEMENT ABOUT BRINGING

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:40.705
BROADBAND TO ALL. THAT WE ALSO

02:19:40.772 --> 02:19:42.373

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.576

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:46.878
