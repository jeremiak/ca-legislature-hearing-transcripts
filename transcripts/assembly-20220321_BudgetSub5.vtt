ANY DELAY WITH A LOT ANALYST'S

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:02.474
OFFICE- WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THIS

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.476
IS ONE OF THE STATE FUNDS THAT

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.010

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.512
CRIMINAL FINING PEOPLE EVAN IS

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:07.579
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.614
COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IN

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.215
PRIOR HEARINGS. SPECIFICALLY

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.984
RELATED TO THIS FUND WE ACTUALLY

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.485
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.120
REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:17.589
PARTIALLY SUPPORT BFS. BEGINNING

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.692
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:21.627
FOUR AND TO PROVIDE DOJ WITH

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:24.696
DIRECTION ON HOW MUCH OF BFS

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.732
OPERATIONS- SHOULD BE COMING

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.133
FROM LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS A

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.135
THIRD OR A HALF. AND SO THIS

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:31.403
WOULD GENERALLY REDUCE THE

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.504
AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.006
WOULD BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:36.074
BASIS TO BACK FILL THIS FINE

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.443
INTO SUPPORT. BFS ADDITIONALLY

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.678
WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS MORE

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.213
EQUITABLE THAN THE EXISTING

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.948
SYSTEM IN WHICH CERTAIN LOCAL

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.082

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.851
SERVICES AT NO CHARGE WHILE

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.486
OTHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:50.022
PAYING TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:52.190
LABORATORIES. SINCE THE AGENCIES

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.159
RECEIVING BFS SERVICES WOULD NOW

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.961
BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR A PORTION

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.763
OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:58.997
RECEIVE IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.966
THEM WITH GREATER INCENTIVE TO

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.001
PRIORITIZE THE WORKLOAD THAT'S

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:05.470
BEING SENT TO DOJ. DOJ WOULD

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.905
STILL HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.507
DETERMINING HOW TO CALCULATE

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.809
EACH AGENCIES SHARE BASED ON THE

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.177
SERVICES THAT IT RECEIVES AND

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.845
CAN CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.981
INCLUDING EQUITY CONCERNS SIZE

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.850

PROVIDED AS WELL AS THE SPEED OF

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.422

A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:27.426

ADAPT TO THAT. SO IN LINE WITH

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:34.499

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.997
NEEDS IF YOU WELL- IN THIS WAS

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:56.201
INCONSISTENT WITH THE RE. WITH

00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:57.469
DESCRIBE HOW THE IDENTIFIED

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:59.370
PROJECTS SUPPORT A LONG TERM.

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:02.240
DURABLE PORTFOLIO OF FACILITIES

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:03.408
TO MEET THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:06.511
AND THE STATE'S LONG TERM. NEED

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.047
FOR PRISON CAPACITY. IN ADDITION

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.081
WHILE THE S. R. L. DIDN'T

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.750
DIRECTLY REQUIRE THIS- WE NOTE

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.119
THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT CONSIDER

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.887
THE SPREAD OF AIRBORNE DISEASE

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.755
AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH PRISON

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:20.492
INFRASTRUCTURE- IN MULTIPLE

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:22.627
EXPERTS HAVE TESTIFIED THAT IN

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.829
COURT THAT- THE ARCHITECTURE OF

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:25.864
SAN QUENTIN HAS BEEN

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.232
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WITH

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:29.200
THE SPREAD OF COVE AND- IT'S

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.435
POSSIBLE THAT. OTHER PRISONS

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:32.036
HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS THAT JUST

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.638
HAVEN'T BEEN UNDER AS MUCH

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.240
SCRUTINY AT SAN QUENTIN SO

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:38.510
THERE'S LESS INFORMATION BUT-

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:39.844
THAT BEING SAID THE REPORT DID

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.179
NOT INCLUDE A SYSTEMATIC

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:42.847
ASSESSMENT OF THAT FACTOR AS IT

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:45.049
RELATES TO INFRASTRUCTURE- AND

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.885
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:48.586
OR NOT. THE REPORT IS OR ISN'T

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:50.622
RESPONSIVE IT IT. WHAT IT DOES

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:52.056
SEEM CLEAR IS THAT THE LIST OF

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.992
PROJECTS MAY ON THE ONE HAND

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.760
INCLUDE. PROJECTS AT THE STATE

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:57.262
ULTIMATELY WON'T NEED TO PURSUE

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:59.931
BECAUSE- THOSE FACILITIES MAY BE

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:02.000
CLOSED AND ON THE OTHER HAND MAY

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.501
NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN PROJECTS OF

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:05.737
THE STATE MAY NEED TO PURSUE.

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.939
PURSUE FOR. AREAS PROGRAMMATIC

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.774

NAMING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.522
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.990
AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.992

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:48.213

IMMEDIATE NEED FOR

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:02.694
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.429

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:20.011
GOING ON LONG BEFORE I BECAME

THAT YOU DO UNDERSTAND THE

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:34.325
SENSITIVITY I THINK THAT THE

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.627
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:36.261
ABOUT EXPECTATIONS OF

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:38.396

THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.241
IT'S STILL NOT TAKING INTO

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:51.476
CONSIDERATION. THE PIECES OF

INFORMATION WE ARE ASKING FOR IT

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.080
SO- IT FILLS IN GENUINE CITIES

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:58.149
TO HEAR THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.917
SENSITIVITIES. OF WHAT WE AS A

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:01.052

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.002
PRETTY CLEAR IT'S BEEN PRETTY

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.371
CLEAR LONG BEFORE I BECAME THE

HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO US AND

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:26.377
HARD FOR ME TO BE APPRECIATIVE.

IN THE PRISON SYSTEM- YOU KNOW

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.987
NOT ONLY THE LACK OF SPACE

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:12.190
WHISTLES DISTANCING THE- THE

00:33:12.256 --> 00:33:15.993
YARD. IN ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.230

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:22.934
MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS- BOTH IN

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.502
THE ARCHITECTURE IN THE

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:26.571
INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT UPGRADES IF

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:27.939
ANY THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:30.408
BECAUSE THEY LOOK A LOT OF THEM

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:31.709
ON THE LIST TO REPAIR AND

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:34.412

IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH CDCR

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:45.857
FOLKS OVER THE YEARS. THEY ADMIT

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:48.025
AND IN THEIR OWN WORDS SAY THAT

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:51.896
THESE FACILITIES ARE DILAPIDATED

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.998
- WORKING IN A WHICH WHICH IF

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:56.067
ANY ON THIS LIST ARE IN RELATION

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.502
TO WHAT WE LEARNED IN LIGHT OF

00:33:57.568 --> 00:34:01.005
COVED IN THOSE DEFICIENCIES. IN

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:03.040
A IN A WAY THAT WE CAN PREVENT

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.743
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:11.816
IN THE PANDEMIC THAT WE SAW. ALL

BORG I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.624
ON CAMERA- THE DEPARTMENT HAS

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.859
TAKEN MANY STEPS OVER THE LAST

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.462
TWO YEARS RELATED TO- COLD AND-

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.431
IN ORDER TO ADJUST BOTH OUR

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.666
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES. AND OUR

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:31.035
MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES- TO

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:34.372
ADDRESS- TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.707
MINIMISE THE- MINIMIZE THE

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.743
POSSIBILITIES OF SPREAD SAYING

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.411
IT IS AN AIRBORNE- AIRBORNE

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.213
SPREAD DISEASE- MANY

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.049
OPERATIONAL- CHANGES REGARDING-

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.984
OCCUPANCY AND- BECAUSE WILL

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:48.753
DISTANCING HAVE OCCURRED.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.888
THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTIONS- I

YOU KNOW AND I'VE BEEN THERE

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.858
WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY AS

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:56.360
AS WE GO- WHEN IT COMES TO THE-

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:58.463
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE A LOT OF

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.164
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO-

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.799
VENTILATION AND THE AND THE ROLE

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:04.435
IT PLAYS- DEPARTMENT- DID

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.370
UPGRADE ALL- AIR HANDLING UNITS.

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.773
THAT RECIRCULATE AIR AS PART OF

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.241
ITS HEATING OR COOLING

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:11.576
OPERATIONS TO USING MERV

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.044
THIRTEEN FILTERS- WHICH WASA

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.579
HIGHER EFFICIENCY FILTER AND-

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:15.947
RECOMMENDED BY A NUMBER OF

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:18.516
INDUSTRY GROUPS- AS A- A GOOD

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.718
WAY OF REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:23.488
OF A SPREADING- THE- VIRUS

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:25.990
THROUGH- THROUGH VENTILATION- WE

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:27.291
ALSO MAXIMIZE AS MUCH AS

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:29.227
POSSIBLE USE OF A DIRECT OUTSIDE

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:31.629
AIR RATHER THAN RECIRCULATION-

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.698
AGAIN TO. MINIMIZE THE-

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:35.099
MINIMIZED POSSIBILITIES OF

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.134
SPREADING IT THAT WAY-

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.971
DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO- REVIEW

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.439
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REPORTS-

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.474
THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. TO LOOK

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.243
AT- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT WAYS

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.944
THAT- THINGS COULD TO COULD BE

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.146
ADJUSTED DOWN THE ROAD- THERE

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.516
ARE NO DIRECT PROJECTS IN HERE-

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:54.585
DIRECTLY- RELATED COBIT. BARLEY

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.787
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE- LITERATURE

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.789
OUT THERE IS CONTINUING TO

00:35:58.856 --> 00:35:59.957
EVOLVE SO WE'RE GOING TO

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.559
CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:04.462
AND SEE WHAT- NEEDS TO BE DONE-

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:06.297
TO ADJUST THE OPERATION. MORE

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:07.498
COMPONENT PARTS OF OUR

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.467
VENTILATION SYSTEMS. I JUST

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:12.870
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS- THE-

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.906
STATEMENT ABOUT- HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:21.379
AND DILAPIDATED CONDITION- WE

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.080
HAVE- BEEN FORTY- IN PARTNERSHIP

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.782
ALLEGED. TO RECEIVE A OF FUNDING

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.817
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS- WE TO A

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.252
MILLION. IN ONE TIME FOR ME

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:29.687
FUNDING BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.889
AND- JUST THIS PAST YEAR- IT

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:32.990
OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:33.991
DOLLARS A ROOF REPLACEMENT

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.593
FUNDING HAS BEEN APPROVED-

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.228
BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:41.132
THIS PAST YEAR- AND- THE ANNUAL

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:42.133
MAINTENANCE FUNDING THE

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.200
DEPARTMENT HAS HAS INCREASED

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:45.903
FROM. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.838
MILLION TO OVER SEVENTY MILLION

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:50.608
THANKS TO- INCREASES IN TWENTY

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.543
NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.111
SO THAT MONEYIS MAKING A

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.780
DIFFERENCE- OUT THERE. THE

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.915
CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN THE

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:00.051
MIDDLE OF THE LAST DECADE ARE-

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:02.219
BEING. ARE ARE BEING ADDRESSED

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.688
IN LARGE PART THROUGH THE ONE

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:06.123
TIME PROJECTS AND THE ANNUAL-

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.959
MAINTENANCE FUNDING INCREASE IS

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:10.127
ALLOWING INSTITUTIONS TO. NOT

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.429
RUN THEIR EQUIPMENT UNTIL IT

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:12.697
FAILED BUT TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.332
IDENTIFY AIR HANDLING UNITS

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.033
PUMPS OTHER KEY PIECES OF

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.636
MACHINERY THAT- ARE BREAKING

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.538
DOWN ON A FREQUENT BASIS AND

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.039
BEING ABLE TO REPLACE THAT. WITH

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.207
THE THEIR ANNUAL FUNDING AMOUNT

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.209
SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.744
CHANGE IN THE WAY THE CONDITIONS

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:30.548
OUT THERE- THAT'LL CONTINUE TO-

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:34.885
INCREASE. FOR THE BETTER- IN THE

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.020
COMING YEARS. JUST A FOLLOW UP

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.055
THING YOU- YOU KNOW IN ADDITION

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:41.892
WE ALSO SAW. THAT DURING THE

00:37:41.959 --> 00:37:44.762
EMERGENCY. IT COULD BE COVERED

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.197
IT COULD BE A NATURAL DISASTER

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:48.766
FOR ALL WE KNOW- WE SAW THAT

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:51.469
FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.804
THEIR LOVED ONES- DURING THAT

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:56.540
TIME BECAUSE OF. ISSUES WITH

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.709
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR WHAT

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.013
HAVE YOU- AS WELL AS TREAT SOME

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.582
TRAINING WAS UNAVAILABLE

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.852
COUNSELING. ENDED IN SOME PLACES

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.754
AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED IT

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.290
THE MOST- WHAT IS BEING PLAN TO

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:15.026
IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.128
PRISONS. SO THAT THIS DOESN'T

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:26.704
HAPPEN AGAIN. IN IN THESE TIMES. LET ME PROVIDE WHAT

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.673
INFORMATION I CAN ON THAT- I DO

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:29.807
HAVE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE NOT A

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.575
PART OF TODAY'S HEARING WHO IS

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.377
PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR- THE

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:35.513
TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OUT OF THE

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:38.149
INSTITUTIONS- I DO KNOW THAT-

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:40.551
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. PROGRAMS

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.952
THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.587
THAT PARTLY WERE DONE IN

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:44.922
RESPONSE TO COBIT OR WERE IN THE

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.324
WORKS HARD CODED REGARDING VIDEO

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.827
VISITATION- WE ARE ALSO-

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:51.696
IMPLEMENTING THE- COMMUNICATION

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:53.464
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM WHICH IS

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:56.734
REPLACING THE- PHONE- THE INMATE

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.303
MORE **** TELEPHONE SYSTEM WITH

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.305
A TABLET- WHICH WILL INCREASE-

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.107
COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES SO

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.508
THERE ARE A NUMBER NUMBER WAY-

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:06.944
WAYS- THAT ARE GOING ON TO

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:10.147
INCREASE- COMMUNICATION- THE-

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:13.584
INCARCERATED POPULATION. AND

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.686
THEIR LOVED ONES. OKAY SO. IS

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.488
THERE A TIMELINE FOR THAT ARE

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:20.991
THERE ON THE WAY BUT- WILL THEY

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.060
BE IN ALL OF FACILITIES I THINK

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.863
WOULD BE. A. I. EITHER TO BE

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.598
ABOUT THE FIVE I COULD ASK MY

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:28.599
COLLEAGUE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.901
INFORMATION- AND- TRUE I WOULD

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:33.037
MISS THE PLANE WILL MAKE SURE

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:33.838
THAT INFORMATION GETS GETS BACK

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:36.340
TO YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.975
COMMITTEE. OKAY AND JUST. IF I

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:41.545
COULD HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION- SO

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.247
IT AS FAR AS IMPROVEMENTS I'M

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.915
LOOKING IN THE LIST OF THEM

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:49.687
IMPROVE AND REPLACE- A LOT WHICH

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:52.690
IS NEEDED DEFINITELY BUT ALSO

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.759
THE OUTLOOK AS YOU KNOW WHAT THE

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:59.330
PRISONS ANY. YOU KNOW GOIG OUT

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.465
TEN TWENTY YEARS WE TALK ABOUT

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:05.336
SOME REALIGNMENT OF FOLKS IF OF

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.404
A PRISONER TO IS CLOSE WE DON'T

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.340
KNOW WHICH ONES THOSE WILL BE

00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.574
BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.910
MEAN THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:15.579
WILL BE MOVED DOWN TO COUNTY

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:19.316
LEVEL OR- OR OTHER. TYPES OF

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.585
SITUATIONS A LOT OF TIMES FOLKS

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.320
HAVE MOVED INTO ANOTHER FACILITY

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:25.456
AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE A

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.758
REDUCTION IN. IN ANOTHER

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.226
FACILITY SO WE'RE BASICALLY

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.595
MOVING PEOPLE AROUND AND SOME OF

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:34.865
THE PLANNING WOULD NEED TO BE-

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.133
YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO THE FACT

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.669
THAT- FOR SOME FACILITIES MAY

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:41.005
INCREASE POPULATION AS AS FOLKS

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:43.908
MOVED AROUND. BUT I GUESS THAT

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:46.443
IS JUST THE COMMON. I WOULD HOPE

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.612
THAT AS WE LOOK OUT INTO THE

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:49.547
FUTURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:50.881
LOOKING AT BRICK AND MORTAR BUT

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.750
TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE CONDITIONS

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.385
NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE INSIDE

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.820
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.755
THERE. LOTS OF FOLKS ARE THEIR

00:40:57.822 --> 00:41:00.958
FAMILIES VISITING LIGHTING SPACE

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:04.328
CLASSROOMS THINGS THAT- ARE

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:09.099
MORE- HAVE MORE OF A HUMAN FEEL.

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.936
TO THEM AS WE LOOK AT REPLACING

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.904
AND REPAIRING. THAT'S MY COMMENT

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:19.510
THANK YOU. MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:22.880
KNOW THAT- ONE POINT EIGHT

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.749
BILLION DOLLARS OF QUITE A- A

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:29.420
SON OF MONEY AND- WE HAVE FORTY

00:41:29.486 --> 00:41:31.555
FIVE. ROGIC SHARED THAT ARE

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.991
LISTED ON HERE BUT THERE DOESN'T

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:37.294
SEEM TO BE ANY PRIORITIZATION. A

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:40.064
WHICH WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.266
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.968
LIKELY THAT NOT EVERYONE OF

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.836
THESE PROJECTS WOULD GET FUNDED

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:47.638
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IS

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.541
THERE SOME KIND OF INTERNAL

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:52.042
PRIORITIZATION THAT YOU'D LIKE

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.245
TO SHARE THAT MIGHT BE A BECOME

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:59.817
AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.318
THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY FOR THAT

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:04.521
QUESTION- THE PRIORITIZATION-

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:07.057
GOES ON ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- IN

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.759
PREPARATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.694
BUDGET RELEASED IN EACH IN

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:15.032
JANUARY- SO DO WITH THAT. ANY

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.567
SORT OF PRIORITIZATION THAT THE

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:17.735
DEPARTMENT COULD PUT TOGETHER

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.303
RIGHT NOW WITH- FORTY FIVE

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.907
PROJECTS- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO-

00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:24.675
TREMENDOUS CHANGE AS WE GO ALONG

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:26.377
BECAUSE W HAVE TO BE READY TO

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:27.778
ADJUST TO CHANGING

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:29.747
CIRCUMSTANCES- BE THAT CHANGING

00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:32.416
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING- THE-

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:34.618
POPULATION OR OR OTHER NEEDS

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.420
WITHIN. THE PRISONS CHANGING

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.055
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING-

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.990
DIFFERENT REGULATORY OR OR COURT

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.159
SITUATION SO THERE ISN'T A HARD

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.895
FAST PRIORITIZATION THAT APPLIES

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.264
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.232
THESE PROJECTS- WE WORK WITH OUR

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.233
STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.001
DEPARTMENT- EACH YEAR WHEN WE'RE

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.037
PREPARING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.472
REQUEST AND OF COURSE THE- ALSO

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:56.840
INCLUDES WORKING WITH.

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.509
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANOTHER-

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:00.444
PURCHASE OF THESE MINISTRATION

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.646
TO THEN NARROW DOWN OUR FOCUS TO

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.748
WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE ANNUAL

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:05.916
BUDGET REQUESTS AND THEN PROVIDE

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.985
VERY DETAILED DOCUMENTS. BACKING

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:10.721
UP BUILD THOSE ITEMS SO THIS WAS

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.656
NOT AN ATTEMPT TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:13.791
LOOK TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.626
BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:16.727
UNIVERSAL PROJECTS THAT WE FEEL

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:19.163
ARE ARE IMPORTANT- BUT AS FAR AS

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.197
WHICH PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:23.033
WOULD BE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR-

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.735
THE NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.603
THE YEAR AFTER- WE'RE GOING TO

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.105
BE DOING THAT PURCHASE ACTION ON

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.506
AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BRING THAT

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:34.278
INFORMATION FORWARD. I. EACH

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:35.012
JANUARY IN THE OF GOVERNOR'S

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.281
BUDGET. SO FIVE YOU. YOU'RE

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.182

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:38.949
OFFICE IS THE ONE THAT. MAKES

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.918
THOSE OF PRIORITIZATION

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:44.388
DECISIONS NOT NOT YOU FOLKS. IS

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.556
THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:48.325
ANOTHER ARNOLD I THINK YOU KNOW.

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:50.861
I APOLOGIZE FOR- PROVIDING THAT

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.496

A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME FOR

MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE

YARD FOR. A CORPORATE WAS ABLE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:04.334
TO RISE AGAIN IN PRIORITY- AND

IS A MAJOR US STAKEHOLDER- AS

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:25.722
FAR AS THE- ABILITY TO HAVE THE-

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:28.491

TO. OVERRIDE OF PROJECTS I THINK

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:09.132

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.067
RADIO TOWER IN EQUIPMENT

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.503

THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND SO WHAT

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.007
WE NEED TO START THE PROCESS BY

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.987
OKAY- ONE OF BURKE TO LAST

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.824

THAT EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION- I

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.444
THINK MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY THREE

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.612
BUT I'M JUST PULLING THAT NUMBER

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.948
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD- AT THE

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.851
OTHER LOCATIONS- THERE ARE-

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.886

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.322
AVAILABLE ADJACENT TO WHERE THE-

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.424
CRISIS BEDS ARE LOCATED BUT

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.626
BECAUSE OF THE- UNIQUE LOCATION

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.895
AT CORCORAN- WHERE WE ACTUALLY

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:46.829

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.133
MIDDLE OF THE INSTITUTION- A

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:52.401
BACK ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO-

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.303
THERE WERE NO- INDIVIDUAL

EXERCISE YARDS- CONSTRUCTED AT

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.308
THAT POINT TIME. SO IN OTHER

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.118
WHEN DISK COULD BE SOMETHING.

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.023
RECOGNIZED THE REDUCING OUR

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:38.060
POPULATION- THAT- HAS LED- TWO

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.995
DECISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:40.729
AND IN CONCERT WITH

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:43.132
ADMINISTRATION- FOR THE CLOSURE

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.300
OF PRISONS THAT WORLD AGREE TO

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:47.336
AND- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT-

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:50.239
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:53.308
TO REVIEW THE FACTORS- THAT ARE

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.777
PRESENT REGARDING POPULATION

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.679
PROJECTIONS A PROJECT A

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:59.048
SUBPOPULATION NEEDS AND ALL THE

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:02.384
ABOVE TO- E. VALUATE- THE

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.719
POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:05.821
CULTURES. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:09.224
IS- THAT THAT ACT CERTAINLY IF

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.527
IT'S NOT MY POSITION TO GIVE MY

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:12.327
OPINION I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.562
OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.432
DEPARTMENT IS NOT AGAINST- WHAT

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.033
THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS MAY

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.370
SHOW- WOULD BE A NEED FOR FUTURE

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:26.775
FUTURE CLOSURES. I JUST THINK

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.711
THAT THE- PATHWAY TO GET THERE-

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.412
REQUIRED A LOT OF DECISIONS ON

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.048
DEPARTMENT- THAT REQUIRE. GOOD

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.850
INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.553
TO BE AVAILABLE. AT THE RIGHT

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:40.589
TIME- AND SO. WE GET BACK TO

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.124
WINNING ORIGINAL POINTS OF YOUR

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.926
DELIVERY OF NOT SPENDING MONEY

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:47.029
AT PRISONS- MORE THERE'S A HIGH

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:48.330
LIKELIHOOD OF CLOSING I THINK

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:49.932
THAT- DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE IN

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:50.733
A POSITION TO SAY THAT WE

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.469
DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK IT'S

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.571
A QUESTION OF BEING ABLE TO. GET

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.306
INFORMATION TOGETHER THAT ALLOWS

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.708
ONE TO SEE- WHAT THE FUTURE'S

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.910
GOING TO HOLD AND BE ABLE TO

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:03.145
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN A MANNER

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.446
THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.882
CONTINUE TO MEET ITS MISSION- AT

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.384
ITS FACILITIES- IT BECAUSE AS

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.453
LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.988
AND HAVE INCARCERATED POPULATION

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.190
AT THE FACILITY WE NEED TO MEET

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:15.891
OUR PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS. THAT

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:18.660
REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF- DEFERRED

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:22.231
MAINTENANCE AND IN CAPITAL

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:25.267
OUTLAY- SO I GUESS I DON'T SEE-THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.035
LEGISLATURE AS BEING. IN A

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:27.870
POSITION OF TIME METRICALLY

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:29.905
OPPOSED- I THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.607
LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.975
PROVIDED THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:33.776
AVAILABLE YET. AND THAT THE

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:36.178
SIDES ARE NOT THAT FAR APART AS

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.413
FAR AS BEING ABLE TO- REACHED

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.349
CERTAIN CUT A CERTAIN DECISIONS.

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.551
REGARDING FUTURE OPERATIONS

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:46.889
PERSONS. BUT ISN'T IT TRUE. THAT

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:49.358
THERE WAS A LAWSUIT SAYING THAT

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:52.594
CDC ARE. REASON FOR STALLING OR

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.196
INHIBITING OUR ABILITY TO CLOSE

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.798
IS BECAUSE OF THE LOSSES IN A WE

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:58.000
HAD NOT COME OVER TO ADEQUATELY

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.201
PLAN. A PLAN THAT I BELIEVE

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:04.373
NEEDS TO COME FROM. C. D. C. R.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.341
AND IF YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:09.745
IT. IT INHIBITS OUR ABILITY. TO

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:13.115
SAVE TAXPAYER MONEY IN CLOSING

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:15.651
THESE FACILITIES. AND OBVIOUSLY

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.453
IN A SAFE EFFICIENT AND

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.322
EQUITABLE MANNER SO WHAT I'M- IT

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:25.394
SOUNDS LIKE. YOU HAVE NOT. IT OR

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.797
CDCR HAS NOT COME ON BOARD WITH

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:33.502
THIS CONCEPT OF CONSOLIDATION OR

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:36.538
- DOING SOME SOME- RIGHT SIZING

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:39.174
SO THAT WE CAN CREATE THE BEST

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:42.644
OPTIMAL. BOB POSITION TO PUT

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.980
EVERYBODY IN A IN A SAFE

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.882
ENVIRONMENT WHILE AT THE SAME

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:49.351
TIME SAVING TAXPAYERS MONEY THE

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:51.386
SAID IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:52.721
THAT THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:55.324
HAS NOT COME TO GRIPS WITH IT

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.891
AND I'VE WRAPPED THEIR ARMS

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:59.228
AROUND IT DID NOT FULLY. KIND

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:02.164
OF- ACCEPTED THAT THIS IS THE

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.866
WAY. AS YOU SAID THE

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.134
LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.170
MAY WANT AND I WOULD IMAGINE IF

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:09.972
WE WERE TO DO A POLL WHEN I KNOW

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:12.407
POLLS AREN'T EXACT REFERRED TO A

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:13.242
POLE WITH TAXPAYERS THEY WOULD

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.843
SAY. THEY AGREE WITH THE

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:17.312
APPROACH. THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.014
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IT'S

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.617
TAKING RIGHT NOW HOWEVER CDC ARE

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:24.019
MAY NOT REALLY BE ON BOARD WITH

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:27.289
THIS JUST YET IT. THIS THIS IS

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.257
DISCOUNTED APPEALING WE'RE

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:35.497
GETTING. I WOULD I WOULDN'T I

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.133
WOULD NEVER I CANNOT AGREE THAT

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.402
THE- DEPARTMENT IS NOT IN THE

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.204
SAME POSITION AS FAR AS THE

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:42.771
GOVERNOR'S CONCERNED BECAUSE

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.406
WE'RE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION

ADMINISTRATION THAT WE GET TO BE

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:30.145
PROJECTIONS. ABOUT PRISON

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:32.180
POPULATION AT THIS POINT CAN YOU

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.750
UGB WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROJECTIONS

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.886
THIS IS FOR CDC ARE. OTHER

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:38.887
THINGS THAT THEY JUST NEED A

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.589
MINUTE BERMAN A FINANCE I CAN

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:41.923
SPEAK TO THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.759
NEXT COUPLE YEARS I DO JUST WANT

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.494
TO KNOW AS THAT MR NEIL

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.862
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE'RE

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:47.629
PROJECTING RIGHT NOW AN INCREASE

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.631
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS-

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:50.932
FOR VARIOUS COVERED RELATED

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.734
REASONS AND BECAUSE OF BACKLOGS-

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.636
IN AND TO ABOUT LEVEL OUT AROUND

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.638
A HUNDRED THOUSAND. I DO WANT TO

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:57.806
NOTE THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW OUR

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.541
PROJECTIONS ARE GENERALLY REALLY

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:00.909
GOOD WITHIN A COUPLE OF

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:01.877
PERCENTAGE POINTS WITHIN THE

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:04.046
NEXT YEAR OR TWO BUT THE FURTHER

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.680
OUT YOU GET- THE MUCH IT BECOMES

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:06.948
MUCH HARDER TO KIND OF PROJECT

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.717
WHERE THE POPULATION WILL BE.

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.018
I'M JUST FOR REFERENCE ABOUT TEN

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.686
YEARS AGO THE POPULATION WAS AT

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.855
ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.991
AND OUR AT ABOUT NINETY FIVE

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.626
THOUSAND SO I THINK IT IT JUST

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:18.794
KIND OF INDICATES KIND OF

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.028
SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS THAT CAN

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.997
OCCUR UP OR DOWN AND THAT'S WHY

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:22.798
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KIND OF DO

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.800
THIS KIND OF LONG TERM PLANNING.

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:27.269
WHEN THE PROJECT WAS IN OUR EARS

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:27.903
CAN BE SO VARIABLE JUST TO BE

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.571
CLEAR YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DO

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.606
NOT HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:32.774
PROJECTIONS THAT CDC ARE PUT ON

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.643
BE ON THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.912
THAT THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY'RE

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:37.679
PROJECTING 4% DECLINE POPULATION

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:41.583
DECLINE. IS THAT WAY TO SET.

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.785
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:44.753
HAVE. FAITH IN THEM JUST THAT

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.689
THEY CAN SWING YOU KNOW TEN OR DEPENDING ON. VARIOUS

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:48.924
ACTIONS WE WEREN'T ANTICIPATING

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.158
KOBE AND THAT POPULATION CAN

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.193
SWING PRETTY DRAMATICALLY

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.260
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF. OUTSIDE

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.728
FACTORS. AND SO IT BECOMES

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.430
DIFFICULT TO SAVE IT. YOU KNOW

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.666
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO. THIS SORT

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.468
OF FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:02.304
BECAUSE OF PROJECTION BETTER

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:05.407
FIVE TEN YEARS OUT. BUT YOUR

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.375
PROJECTIONS ARE NOT ACTUALLY

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:08.977
TENURE SOUTH THAT YOU THAT WE

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.412
ARE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY THERE

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.447
ARE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MAYBE

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.782
FIVE YEARS SO IT'S ACTUALLY A

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.251
PRETTY SHORT TERM. WE PASSED

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:17.619
LEGISLATION ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.454
PROJECTING FOR EXAMPLE I WORK A

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:20.722
LOT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE SPACE

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.357
AND WE'VE BEEN PROJECTING

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:22.958
TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY AND WE

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.893
FELT CONFIDENCE IN THAT WITH THE

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.294
ADMINISTRATION. SO UNDERSTAND

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.696
HOW. HOW YOU DON'T HAVE

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.564
CONFIDENCE IN THE PROJECTIONS

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.099
THAT CDC ARE PROVIDED FOR THE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.468
NEXT FOUR TO FIVE YEARS. TO HELP

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:36.004
US. OUT TO USE THAT. IN COMING

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.239
UP WITH THE LIST OR

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.774
INFRASTRUCTURE OUT CAPITAL

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:44.646
OUTLAY. IN A INVESTOR P. A. S.

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.515
BILL WITH ITS PROVIDED AS PART

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:47.749
OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.251
PROJECTIONS GO OUT ABOUT TEN

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.353
YEARS. AND THOSE ARE CONJECTURAL

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.088
AND CONCEPTUAL PROJECTS THAT

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:55.090
WERE PROJECTING UP TO ABOUT TEN

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.892
YEARS. BUT AS MR FORGET MENTION

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.093
AS PART OF THE DELIVERED OF

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.728
BUDGET PROCESS EVERY YEAR WE

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:00.962
KIND OF ANALYZE AND ASSESS THAT

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.397
MOST URGENT FIRE LIFE SAFETY

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.099
NEEDS ARE. COURT MANDATED NEED

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:05.600
TO AND WE PROJECT THAT WAS AND

INCLUDE THOSE IN THE BUDGET AND-

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:10.472
DISCUSS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:11.706
ON WHAT FUND. SO I'M I'M HAPPY

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.875
ABOUT IT THE COURT MANDATES. THE

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:14.843
DEPARTMENT EITHER HERE BECAUSE

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.545
WE HAVE FAILED AGAIN- ONE OR

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.713
ANOTHER AND SO. WHEN IT SEPARATE

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.881
THOSE FROM THE DISCUSSION FOR A

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.650
SECOND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:22.617
WE'RE COMPLYING WITH THE

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:25.220
COURT'S- WE HAVE MADE. WE SEE

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.956
THE PRISON POPULATION DECLINING.

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.325
YET WE SEE THE BUDGET FOR THIS

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:33.495
DEPARTMENT INCREASING- OUT. FROM

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:34.930
THE SET OF QUESTIONS WE'VE

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.765
GOTTEN FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.200
WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.601
PRIORITIZING AND WE DON'T HAVE

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.303
FAITH THAT. WE'RE SPENDING

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:43.572
DOLLARS A PROBABLY VOTE BOTH

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:46.107
BOTH FOR. THINGS LIKE SAFETY BUT

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:48.577
ALSO PROJECT TEAM. THE TYPES OF

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.045
CULTURAL SHIFTS THAT WE WANT TO

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:53.081

THAT STARTS TO TAKE INTO THAT

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.527
INTO CONSIDERATION THINGS THAT

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:08.129
POPULATION DECREASING PRESENTS

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:12.500
CLOSE SEEN. CHANGING OUR

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.970
APPROACH TO REHABILITATION. HOW

DO YOU BEST THANK WEEK WE MIGHT

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.408
BE ABLE TO GET. THAT MATRIX

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.743
SERVING A FOR LACK OF A BETTER

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:22.978
WORD FROM CDC I THE

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.880
ADMINISTRATION. WHICH IS WHAT

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:29.117

AT THE END ENSURE THINK THAT'S A

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.859
GREAT QUESTION ONE OF THE

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:39.027
THINGS. THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:39.794
INVESTING AND REGULATED

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:40.462
ADMINISTRATION APARTMENT HAS

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.963
BEEN THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.132
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.234
BECAUSE OF THIS YEAR TO KIND OF

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:47.669
INCREASE- YOU KNOW CAN BE A

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.104
COLLEGE ACCESS FOR. INCARCERATED

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.572
INDIVIDUALS SO A LOTOF THE

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.740
BUDGET INCREASES IN THE MOST

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:52.907
RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:53.808
ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS LIKE

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:56.011
HEALTH CARE- OR EDUCATIONAL

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.545
OPPORTUNITIES AND- AND LIKE YOU

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.681
MENTIONED IT IS KIND OF A SHIFT

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:00.181
IN. HOW WE'RE TREATING

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.584
INCARCERATED POPULATIONS- AS FAR

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.152
AS- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:06.254
AGAIN WE- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.922

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.492
RIGHT POINT BUT WE THINK THAT.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.394
WHAT WE PUT FORWARD IS BEING.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.762
RESPONSIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:15.163
WERE AGAIN KIND OF LISTING WHAT

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.431
PROJECTS WERE PROJECTING RIGHT

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:20.702

LEGISLATURE- IT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:33.315
EIGHTEEN- THIS DISCUSSION.

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.517
STARTED OF VERY SPECIFICALLY AND

THIS POINT AS WE KEEP TALKING

INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING IF IT IS

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.610
A VERY DIFFICULT TO KIND OF

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:43.778
PROJECT OUT HERE WHO NEEDS TO

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.947
KNOW. IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.115
STORM THAT HAD OCCURRED I THINK.

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.783
SIX YEARS AGO OR SO THEY KIND OF

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.919
STARTED THE ROOF INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:51.686

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:54.889
SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:55.957
SOMETHING LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.158
SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE MIGHT

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:59.160
OCCUR AND THAT WOULD TOP OFF OUR

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:00.628
OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS IT WHICH

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.630
IS WHY WHEN WE'RE DOING KIND OF

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:03.565
DELIBERATE BUDGET PROCESS EVERY

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.600
YEAR. WE PROJECT WHAT WE NEED AT

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:08.102
THAT TIME. THE URGENT ISSUES

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:10.038
THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I'M

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.773
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE TEN YEARS I

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.809
HAVEN'T BEEN HERE YOU KNOW- FOR

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.311
THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BUT

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.313
IN. MY TEN YEARS HERE WE

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:20.348
DEFINITELY PLAN AHEAD AND WE

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:21.216
PLAN AHEAD INCLUDING THINKING

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.051
ABOUT. EMERGENCIES WHETHER

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:25.053
THAT'S AN EARTHQUAKE- WHETHER

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:27.021
THAT'S CLIMATE CHANGE. WEATHER

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.656
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:29.324
SURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING BETTER

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:34.796
FOR. THE NEXT SEARCHING COLLATOR

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:35.797
. THE NEXT YOU KNOW- A MEDICAL

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:37.699
HEALTH SHOULD HAVE HERE- SO. I

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:39.000
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FEELS LIKE

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:41.102
YOU'RE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:44.405
GAME ON US TO FOR. TO CONTINUE

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.241
TO HAVE A BLOATED BUDGET WHEN WE

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.176
SEEM TO MEAN FOR DICK DECLINING

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:51.913

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.084
SEEMS TO WORK IN SOME CASES BUT

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:59.854
NOT OTHERS NOT NOT IN THIS CASE

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:00.788

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.058
BUDGET LINE ITEMS YOU KNOW ON

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.360

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:06.861
BEEN HISTORICALLY VERSUS OVERALL

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:08.763
COSTS BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT.

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.698
THE EMPHASIS ON INCREASING COSTS

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:11.466
HAVE LARGELY BEEN ASSOCIATED

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:13.001
WITH HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.802

ORDERED MANDATE SO. AGAIN I AM

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.506
NOT SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE A

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:19.774
COMPARISON ON THE OVERALL

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.543
DEPARTMENT BUDGET COMPARED TO

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:24.379
SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:43.010
CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:46.547
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.483
FIND THAT THE IDEA OF INSTALLING

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:49.851
NEW CELLPHONE INTERDICTION

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.586
TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS APPEARS

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.554
REASONABLE AS IT COULD HELP

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:55.256
REDUCE CRIME BOTH INSIDE AND

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:57.325
OUTSIDE OF PRISON. HOWEVER WE'RE

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.392
CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.428
PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.996
COULD RESULT IN THE INFLATION OF

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.865
THE TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS THAT

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.666
ARE CLOSE SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:07.001
AND THAT'S BECAUSE UNDER THE

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.736
PROPOSAL CDCR WOULD RECEIVE

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.271
FUNDING TO INSTALL THE

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:13.407
TECHNOLOGY AT- ALL THREE OF ITS

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.109
STATE OWNED AND CURRENTLY

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:18.146
OPERATED PRISONS- YET AS WE

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:19.614
DISCUSSED EARLIER THE STATE THE

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.849
POPULATION DECLINE- SUGGESTS

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:25.186
THAT THE STATE COULD BE AN- A

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.053
POSITION TO CLOSE AROUND FIVE

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.156
PRISONS. OVER THAT SAME TIME

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:30.291
PERIOD THAT BEAT TECHNOLOGY

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:31.058
WOULD BE ROLLED OUT UNDER THE

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.095
PROPOSAL. A ROUGHLY AROUND THE

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.397
SAME TIME PERIOD. I'M SO TO

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.099
REDUCE THE RISK OF INSTALLING

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:38.866
CELLPHONE INTERDICTION

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.968
TECHNOLOGY AT PRISONS THAT ARE

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.436
SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSE WE RECOMMEND

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:44.906
ONE. PROVIDING FUNDING ONLY FOR

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:48.209
A PUT A PORTION OF THE PRISONS.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.443
AND TO ENSURING THAT THE

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.946
TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY INSTALLED AT

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.581
PRISONS THAT ARE NOT STRONG

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.616
CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE. AND SAYS

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.851
PACIFIC WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:59.053
LEGISLATURE IMPROVE APPROVE ONLY

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.922
FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:02.723
AS LAID OUT IN THE PROPOSALS SO

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.659
THAT WOULD INCLUDE EIGHT.

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:06.027
PRISONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND

01:31:06.093 --> 01:31:08.095
TWELVE PRISONS IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:10.765
THREE TWENTY FOUR- AND REJECT

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:12.600
FOR NOW THE REMAINING PRESENTS.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:15.169
AND THEN SECOND BEFORE-

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:16.137
PROVIDING THE FUNDING WE

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:17.805
RECOMMEND DIRECTING CDCR TO

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.440
PROVIDE A LIST OF WHAT TURNED

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.875
TWENTY PRESENT IT WOULD INSTALL

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:23.311
THE TECHNOLOGY AT- SO THAT THE

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:25.313
LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:27.515
THAT LIST DOESN'T- THAT LIST

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.150
ONLY INCLUDES PRISONS THAT ARE

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:30.351
NOT STRONG CANDIDATES FOR

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:32.520
CLOSURE. AND THAT I GENERALLY

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.688
NEED PRISONS THAT PROVIDE A

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.791
CENTRAL OR PURCHASING A

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:37.692
SPECIALIZED HEALTHCARE SERVICES

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:39.894
OR- ARE CAPABLE OF HOUSING

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:42.230
INMATES WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:43.664
CLASSIFICATIONS OF SECURITY

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.933
CLASSIFICATIONS XCERRA. AND OF

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.734
COURSE EASIER COULD COME BACK

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:49.036
AND REQUEST. FUNDING FOR THE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.471
REMAINING PRESENT IN THE FUTURE

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:51.939
WHEN THAT THERE'S A CLEAR SENSE

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.141
OF WHAT- AND HOW MANY PRISONS

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:54.942
WOULD BE WILL BE ULTIMATELY

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:57.245
CLOSED. I ALSO KNOW THAT TAKING

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:58.713
THE STAGE APPROACH TO FUNDING

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:00.114
THE TECH THE EXPANSION OF THE

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.415
TECHNOLOGY COULD ALSO IMPROVE

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.351
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. OF ITS

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:06.687
ROLLOUT- TO ENSURE THAT SAID

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.155
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS IMPLEMENTED

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:10.691
EFFECTIVELY AND CONSISTENT WITH

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.292
THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:15.696
THANK YOU. HI AND LENITION

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.865
MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AT

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.500
THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.135
NOT IDENTIFIED ANY ADDITIONAL

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.237
CLOSURES AS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED-

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.105
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.473
ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE TO

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.508
INVEST IN STATE INSTITUTIONS TO

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.644
PROVIDE A SAFE AND SECURE

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.444
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE INCARCERATED

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:31.879
POPULATION STAFF AND THE

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:33.881
COMMUNITY. I WOULD NOTE THAT

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.049
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:37.084
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS PROPOSAL DUE

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:38.586
TO THE FACT THAT IT IS A MULTI

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.988
YEAR ROLLOUT SHOULD A PERSON BE

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.391
IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE AFTER THE

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:44.392
EQUIPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.560
INSTALLED THE EQUIPMENT CAN BE

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.297
RELOCATED TO ANOTHER PERSON- IF

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:51.265
THE NEW EQUIPMENT HAS YET TO BE

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:52.433
INSTALLED THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:53.901
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:55.369
ENHANCED CELLULAR INTERDICTION

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:56.704
WILL BE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:59.173
FUND THROUGH THE BUDGETING

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.274
PROCESS WHEN CLOSING THAT PERSON

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:01.575
. I READ JUST REITERATE TO THE

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:03.244
SUB COMMITTEE THAT ENHANCE

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.745
CELLULAR INTERDICTION IT'S AN

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:06.580
IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURE TO

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:07.581
DISABLE THE ILLEGAL USE OF

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:09.317
CELLPHONES. WITHIN THE PRISONS

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:11.485
THAT THEY CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.287
THE SKIPS GANG ACTIVITY

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:15.122
NARCOTICS DISTRIBUTION AS WELL

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:16.457
AS VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:20.161
INCARCERATED PEOPLE. STAFF AND

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.362
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THANK

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:32.773
YOU. SO GIVEN. I WOULD SAY THIS-

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.576
GIVEN GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT WE

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.578
DON'T HAVE A CLEAR LONG TERM.

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:40.781
PLAN FOR PRESSING CLOSER SEVEN

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:45.653
OTHERS COMMITMENTS FOR THAT- CAN

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.555
THE CDC ARE OR THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:50.191
FINANCE SPEAK TO L. A. O.'S

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.393
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE DO THIS

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:57.832
IN STAGGERING. PROCESS. SURE AS%

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.567
I SAID I BELIEVE IT IS SOMEWHAT

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.135
OF A STACK OF PROCESS ALREADY

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.269
BECAUSE IT ROLLS OUT OVER

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:06.073
MULTIPLE YEARS- SHOULD AS PRISON

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.909
ALTERNATELY DECIDE. HE DECIDED A

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.811
CULTURE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.513
BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PRISON

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.548
OR IF THAT PERSON HAS NOT

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:15.750
RECEIVED INSTALLATION OF THAT

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:17.218
YET THAT FUNDING WOULD BE

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:20.087
RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:20.621
ASSOCIATIVE THAT PRISON'S

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:23.224
CLOSURE. BUT IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.925
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:25.993
STAGGERED PROCESS WHERE WE

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.329
ASKING FOR ALL THE MONEY UP

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:29.096
FRONT AND NOT BUDGETING THAT IN

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:34.068
A STANDARD WAY. I BELIEVE. MANY

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.636
PROPOSALS ARE OFTEN DONE IN A

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.371
MULTIPLE YEAR ROLLOUT PHASE

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.106
THAT'S JUST HOW THE EQUIPMENT

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.508
WILL BE INSTALLED ON THIS ONE

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:43.077
SURE THAT ALL PRISONERS RECEIVE.

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.745
THE SECURITY MEASURES NEEDED.

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.746
BUT DO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.516
IT'S NOT OFFICES BUT IF I SEE

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:49.150
OUR PRESENCE THAT WILL REMAIN.

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:57.691
OPEN. I CANNOT FUNDING COULD BE.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.527
TAKEN DOWN WHEN THEY'RE IF A

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:00.828
PRISON CLOSURES ALTERNATELY

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:05.433
DECIDED. BUT THAT DOESN'T-ACCOUNT FOR WHERE YOU TO SOME OF

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:06.867
THAT IN SOME PRISONS. WE MIGHT

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.969
INSTALLED. WE MIGHT INSTALL THE

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:11.072
EQUIPMENT AND THEN AFTER THE

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:13.074
MATTER. CHOOSE TO CLOSE ON THE

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.310
PERSON. SO THAT WOULD STILL HAVE

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.778
AN CRITICS SPENCER THEM WITH

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:20.081
UNNECESSARY. I'M NOT EQUIPMENT

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:22.249
COULD BE REPURPOSED AND MOVE TO

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.752
ANOTHER INSTITUTION- IT'S STILL

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:27.288
THE TECHNOLOGY IS EVOLVING FOR.

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.156
FURTHER TESTS- AND WE THINK IT'S

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.325
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.961
SECURITY OF THE PRISONS BY

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.496
DISABLING THOSE ILLEGAL

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:39.800
CELLPHONES. SO WE AGREE THAT

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:42.369
THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. ITEM

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:43.537
TO INVEST AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.306
SURE WE'RE INVESTING IN IT AND

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:49.310
IN A THOUGHTFUL MANNER. AND IF

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.779
THIS IS GOING TO BE. SPREAD OUT

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.747
OVER TIME IT MIGHT MAKE MORE

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.716
SENSE THAT AS WE GET INFORMATION

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:58.085
WE- ALLOCATE MONIES IN THE

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:01.822
FUTURE AND NOT. NOW THAT WE

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:02.957
MIGHT ENCOURAGE SOME UNNECESSARY

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:09.497
SPENDING. DO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:11.265
ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM.

01:36:11.332 --> 01:36:12.466
MISTER JONES SAWYER AND

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:15.536
ASSERTING. I LARA AYE I THINK

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.238
WE'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS BUT

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:19.039
THE SECULAR INTERDICTION

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:22.143
TECHNOLOGY I DON'T THINK YOU'LL

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.410
FIND ANYONE THAT THAT'S AGAINST

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:26.547
IT AD IN FACT- WE PROBABLY

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.516
SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. WE CAN

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.317
TEST ITS ACCOUNTABILITY IS

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:33.754
RELIABILITY IS EFFECTIVENESS

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:35.322
WHETHER THAT'S THE NUMBER OF-

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:37.024
CONTRABAND AT STATE SEIZE WHILE

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.526
YOU HAVE IT THEIR NUMBER FONG

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.661
CELLPHONES THEY RECEIVED IT CAN

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.596
WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF-

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:45.099
VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENS. IN PRISON

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.767
DOESN'T GO DOWN AS A RESULT OF

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:48.636
PUTTING NEEDS IN IT ISN'T

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:50.504
TANGIBLE THINGS THAT WE CAN TEST

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.139
YOUR COME BACK. TO THIS

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:55.242
COMMITTEE AND ITS BASIC SAY

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:57.511
SINCE WE PUT. THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.947
IMPRISONED HEY. IT'S IMPROVE THE

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:01.949
QUALITY OF LIFE IS IMPROVE THE

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:05.252
SAFETY OF INMATES AND GUARDS-

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.888
PROPORTIONALLY BY X. AMOUNT AND

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.790
THIS IS WHY THIS IS A GREAT NOT

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:12.693
A GOOD AND- TECHNOLOGY PRODUCES

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:13.594
GREAT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:17.331
BENEFICIAL. TO THE- TO CDC ARE

01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:19.567
AS A WHOLE I THINK YOU MAY BE ON

01:37:19.633 --> 01:37:21.435
TO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VERY

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:25.339
VERY HELPFUL AND- IF YOU'RE ABLE

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.641
TO CAPTURE ITS BENEFITS OF

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:30.644
ULTIMATELY- IT NOT ONLY WOULD IT

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:32.313
SPREAD TO THE OTHER PRISONS. BUT

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.615
AS NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES OUT

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.251
BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW-

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:39.253
CRIMINALS ARE VERY SMART NO

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.688
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET AROUND

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:42.489
THIS WE MAY HAVE TO BUY

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:43.557
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.526
SOPHISTICATED. WILL INVEST THAT

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:47.228
BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE THE DATA

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:48.896
THAT SHOWS THAT THIS TYPE OF

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:51.832
TECHNOLOGY. IS THE BEST THING

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:54.635
FOR A- FOR OUR PRISON POPULATION

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.804
AND THE PRISON GUARDS SO IS

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:58.505
THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD. COME UP

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:00.507
WITH WITH THE ALGORITHM OR- SOME

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.977
KIND OF CODE THAT CAN SHOW US

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:05.346
HOW EFFECTIVE. USE OF THIS

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.982
TECHNOLOGY COULD BE. OR IS THAT

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:09.883
SOMETHING YOU GOT TO COME BACK

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:13.988
TO US WITH. HELLO I BELIEVE THAT

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:16.056
WE WOULD NEED TO COME BACK TO

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:17.424
YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL MITIGATING

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:20.294
FACTORS AT THAT WAY INTO WHAT

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:22.496
AND CHANGES THE BEHAVIOR AND THE

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:24.698
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE PRESENT-

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:27.568
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:30.271
BLOCKING A CELL PHONES AND

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:31.672
INTERDICTING. CONTRABAND FROM

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.941
COMING INTO THE PRESENCE IS OVER

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:36.410
ALL AND VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:38.812
DEPARTMENT- BUT WE WILL BE

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:43.050
LOOKING AT- WAYS OF COLLECTING

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:44.518
THAT DATA- EVEN MORE THAN WE

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:47.087
ALREADY DO. TO BE ABLE TO SHARE

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:49.156
THAT BACK WITH ME WITH THE

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:51.525
ASSEMBLY. CAN YOU GIVE US LIKE

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:52.893
AN OUTLINE OF WHAT THAT COULD

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.129
POSSIBLY LOOK AT LIKE AS YOU. AS

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.798
YOU COME BACK TO IT AGAIN FOUR

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:59.733
FOUR ESPECIALLY TO DO THIS IN A

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.068
TIERED STAGGERED MANNER THAT YOU

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.970
CAN COME BACK IN. AND THEY

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.438
REALLY HAVE SOME GOOD DATA OF

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:07.341
WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT- A MAN

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:08.742
I HAVE SO MUCH FAITH IN IT THAT

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:11.178
I KNOW TO COME. IF YOU IF YOU

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:13.380
ANALYZE IT UP FRONT. ONE DISK

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:15.282
COMMITTEE IN AND- WILL

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.851
OVERWHELMINGLY BE IN FAVOR OF

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:21.055
EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. I DO KNOW

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.856
THAT WE ARE ALREADY TRACKING-

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:25.893
AND- A LOT AROUND THE

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.328
CONFISCATED CELLPHONES AND

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:29.263
CONFISCATED- OTHER CONTENT FROM

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.532
THE CONTRABAND- BUT I DO THINK

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.934
THAT WE COULD- PULL THEM

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:36.937
TOGETHER STEM AND YEAH-

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:39.373
MEASUREMENTS. SOME METRICS THAT

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.142
WE WOULD LIKE TO- BASELINE AND

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.811
THEN BRING BACK TO THIS

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:46.980
COMMITTEE- WHEN WE CAN SHOW-

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.315
WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:51.051
DOING ESPECIALLY AFTER IT'S BEEN

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:58.692
UPGRADED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:01.895
MEASURES JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:03.797
WHAT WE MEASURE WAS TALKING

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:07.101
ABOUT SO- I GUESS WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:09.036
WHAT I HEARD FROM DEPARTMENT OF

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:13.674
FINANCE. WAS THAT- THEY WANT TO

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.509
HAVE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:18.979
BECAUSE- THEY HAVE A MULTI YEAR

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.814
PLAN ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT WHAT

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:23.650
WE HEARD FROM THE- FOR MISTER

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:25.319
BORK IS THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE

01:40:25.386 --> 01:40:26.954
YEAR TO YEAR WITH ALL THE

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.056
FACILITIES PLANNING SO WHICH-

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.091
SOME CONFUSED WHICH ONE IS IT.

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.993
WE CAN PLAN OUR WE DO EVERYTHING

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.295
YEAR TO YEAR. BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.497
WE WERE HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:39.032
FROM. DIFFERENT FACTIONS IN THE

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:42.903
DEPARTMENT. LET ME SHATTER

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:45.506
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO WE

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.807
WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THIS

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.642
TECHNOLOGY TO ALL THE

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.043
INSTITUTIONS AND REALLY MAKE

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.879
SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING PACE

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:53.447
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OUT WE FEEL

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:55.249
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;T'S IMPORTANT TO. SECURING THE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:57.084
FUNDING FOR ALL INSTITUTIONS

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:59.386
NOW- WELL FUNDING ISN'T

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.921
AVAILABLE TO EXPAND TO ALL

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:02.556
INSTITUTIONS AND WE DON'T WANT

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.525
TO GET IN A POSITION WHERE A FEW

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:06.360
YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE DON'T

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.295
HAVE AS MUCH. AVAILABLE FUNDING

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.630
AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:13.000
PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL SECURITY

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:15.869
AT ALL INSTITUTIONS. OKAY BUT

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.538
HOW THE HOW HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.872
DETERMINE THAT EVERY FOR EVERY.

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:20.974
FACILITY NEEDS THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:21.508
WHEN YOU CAN DETERMINE THE

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:24.978
PREVIOUS ITEM- WHAT ITEMS WHICH

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:27.247
ITEMS NEED IMPROVING AT

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:30.951
DIFFERENT FACILITIES. SOME OF

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:33.120
THE INSTITUTIONS DON'T HVE BEST

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:35.322
MANAGE ACCESS OUR SYSTEM

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.825
TECHNOLOGY IT ALSO CURRENTLY

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:38.792
EIGHTEEN OF THE INSTITUTIONS

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:41.428
HAVE SOME LEVEL OF THIS SECURITY

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:45.299
HOWEVER IT'S NOT- HOW DOUBLE AT

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.700
FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY SO THIS IS

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:49.203
REALLY TO EXPAND TO THOSE

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:49.703
INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.071
CURRENTLY HAVE THIS AVAILABLE.

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:53.106
AND KEEP PACE WITH THE

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.908
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S EVOLVING- WE

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:57.110
DON'T WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:41:57.177 --> 01:42:01.248
THAT THAT WE REALLY CAN- REDUCE.

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:04.985
THE DESIRE FOR CELL PHONES BY

01:42:05.052 --> 01:42:07.054
DISABLING THEM. THANK GOD I GOT

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.689
IT SO THAT IN THE TIMELINE

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:10.624
AGAINST THIS POSES ON. THE ONE

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.460
LISTED IN THE REPORT WHERE IT'S-

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:16.363
ALL THE- OVER FROM NOW TOLD

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:17.498
TWENTY TWENTY SIX IS WHEN ALL

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:21.869
THE FACILITIES WOULD BE DONE.

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:25.772
YES THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY I DON'T

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:29.109
KNOW I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER BUT

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:31.345
STILL I THINK IT DOESN'T REALLY

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.413
MAKE SENSE TO ME HOW YOU COULD

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.748
BE SO SURE SO MANY YEARS OUT

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:36.850
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT HAVE NO

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:37.985
IDEA WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:13.981
AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE WOULD

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.649
INCLUDE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:17.684
COUNTY SHERIFF'S AND PROBATION

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:20.654
DEPARTMENTS- MISTER JONES SAWYER

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.555
ON THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.523
FAMILIAR WITH THE SEC'S

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:24.191
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.159
PROGRAMS- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:27.794
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.363
BUT I JUST WANTED TO. ALSO

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:31.498
MENTION A COUPLE OF THOUGHT ON

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:33.100
THAT I'M AWARE HAVE HAVE COME

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:36.470
QUESTIONS THAT ACCOMPANY THE

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.871
COMMITTEE ABOUT. WHY IS THAT IT

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:38.739
MINISTRATION IS PRIORITIZING

01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:40.273
THESE RESOURCES TO COMBAT

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.609
ORGANIZED RETAIL FACT- INSTEAD

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:43.844
FOCUS WAY WHEN THERE ARE A LOT

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:46.179
OF OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:48.482
AND I THINK THE- PERSPECTIVE OF

01:44:48.548 --> 01:44:49.716
THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THIS

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:52.019
IS A PROPOSAL. THAT ADDRESSES

01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:54.488
THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.089
OF CONCERN CERTAINLY ARE TO THE

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:57.224
GOVERNOR OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.959
BUT I THINK TOO MANY ACROSS THE

01:44:59.026 --> 01:45:00.761
STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THAT

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:01.928
THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT

THAT COME UP IN LATER- PANELS.

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:33.353
I'M SO MOVING ON TO MY OVER

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:34.387

WHAT WHICH IS COMING UP IN A

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:57.444
LATER PANEL. TODAY REGARDING THE

01:46:57.511 --> 01:47:01.548
REMAINING FUNDING.

01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:03.583
IT TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND THEN

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:06.787
ALIGN THE RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY

TO ENSURE THAT THE GOALS AND

01:47:08.021 --> 01:47:08.989
OBJECTIVES ARE MET. AND THAT'S

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.957
BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THE

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:12.225
GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PLAN WHICH AS

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.994
I MENTIONED GENERALLY TARGETS

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.463
THESE. BROAD GOALS OF REDUCING

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.231
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT-

01:47:18.298 --> 01:47:20.801
ADDRESSING FIREARMS AND REDUCING

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:22.502
DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.603
CRIMES. LACKS CLEAR AND SPECIFIC

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.405
OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING EACH OF

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:27.274
THOSE SCHOOLS WHICH MAKES IT-

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.508
QUITE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:30.844
WHETHER THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:33.814
EFFECTIVE- FOR EXAMPLE THE TYPES

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.148
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THAT CAN

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:37.317
FALL UNDER ORGANIZED RETAIL

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:39.152
THEFT CAN BE QUITE BROAD. CAN

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.854
RANGE FROM TWO PEOPLE WORKING

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.255
TOGETHER TO STEAL MERCHANDISE TO

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:44.391
RETURN IT FOR STORE CREDIT. ON

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:45.892
TO A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:47.727
IS EXPLOITING PEOPLE POTENTIALLY

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.462
AND STEALING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:51.865
WORTH OF MERCHANDISE AND SELLING

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.201
IT ONLINE. SO WITHOUT A CLEAR-

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:55.702
OBJECTIVE ADDS IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:47:55.769 --> 01:47:57.671
ASSESS WHICH TYPE OR- WHAT

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:59.973
ASPECT OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.408
THE GOVERNOR'S INTENDING TO

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:03.643
TARGET- WHICH IN TURN MAKES IT

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.512
DIFFICULT TO IT- SS WORD WHETHER

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:08.381
THE PROPOSED STRATEGIES WOULD-

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.083
OR OR WHAT OTHER ACTIONS WOULD

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.651
MAKE SENSE TO EFFECTIVELY

01:48:11.718 --> 01:48:13.954
TARGETED. AT TARGET THE

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:16.690
OBJECTIVES- WITH LIMITED

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:19.025
RESOURCES. TO ASSIST THE

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:21.127
LEGISLATURE IN DEVELOPING ITS

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:23.396
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- OUR

01:48:23.463 --> 01:48:24.698
PUBLICATION PREVENTS PRESENTS

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:28.235
DATA ON CRIME AND FIREARM TRENDS

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:29.069
. WE ARE TO DISCUSS FIREARM

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:31.805
TRENDS AS WELL AS SOME OPTIONS

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:32.706
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AT

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.741
OUR FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:38.078
HEARING- AND SO NOW I'M GOING TO

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:40.046
DISCUSS VERY BRIEFLY SOME CRIME

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:42.249
TRENDS TO THE M. FOR- THE

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:45.585
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AT THAT

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:46.720
THINKS ABOUT ITS PUBLIC SAFETY

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:49.022
GOALS- AND BROADLY CRIME DATA WE

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:51.391
FOUND SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:52.025
SPECIFIC GOALS MAY NOT BE VERY

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:53.827
WELL TARGETED. AND THAT'S

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:54.828
BECAUSE WHILE THERE'S NO

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:56.663
OFFICIAL DATA ON ALL RETAIL

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.765
THEFT- SHOPLIFTING DECLINED

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:00.700
SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN TWENTY

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:03.003
NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY-

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:04.537
PRELIMINARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:06.206
DATA FROM FOUR LARGE CITIES DOES

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:08.041
SUGGEST THAT OVERALL LARCENY.

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:09.542
WHICH INCLUDE SHOPLIFTING IS

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.945
INCREASING BUT IT HASN'T YET

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:14.547
RETURNED TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:16.783
. I'M AT LEAST AS OF OCTOBER

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:19.185
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE FOUND

01:49:19.252 --> 01:49:20.287
AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY

01:49:20.353 --> 01:49:21.755
INSTEAD WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:49:21.821 --> 01:49:23.123
ADDRESSING RECENT CONCERNING

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:24.658
INCREASES IN HOMICIDES

01:49:24.724 --> 01:49:26.326
AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND MOTOR

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.628
VEHICLE RELATED THEFT. I WOULD

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.697
JUST NOTE HOWEVER THAT- SOME

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:32.699
EXPERTS AND RETAILERS HAVE NOTED

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:34.301
THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN

01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:36.603
INCREASE IN BRAZEN F. AND-

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.338
OVERALL SOPHISTICATION OF

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.474
SHOPLIFTERS- THIS IS LARGELY

01:49:41.541 --> 01:49:43.109
ANECDOTAL THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.645
GOOD- STATEWIDE DATA ON THAT

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:47.647
ALTHOUGH NONETHELESS COULD. BE

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:51.017
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- AND

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:53.920
I'D ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE CRIMES

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:55.922
THEM STATEWIDE MAY NOT BE

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:58.959
SHOWING- AS A CONCERNING TREND

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:04.597
ON RETAIL THEFT- THERE COULD BE-REASON TO LOOK AT- LOCAL AREAS

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:06.066
OF CONCERN AS THAT IS THE CASE

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:07.500
THAT CRIME TRENDS OFTEN VERY

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:09.903
QUITE A BIT BY. REGION AND TYPE

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.539
OF CRIME. AND THEN FINALLY TO

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:13.840
THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:15.075
INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING CRIME

01:50:15.141 --> 01:50:16.376
RELATED GOALS OUR PUBLICATION

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:18.411
PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS FOR THE

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:19.879
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHICH

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.782
BROADLY- ARE IN THE CATEGORIES

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:23.616
ESSENTIALLY OF EXPANDING ON

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:25.218
EXISTING PROGRAMS OR PILOTING

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:27.320
RESEARCH BASED SOLUTIONS FOR

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:28.788
EXAMPLE EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.724
THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO TARGET

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.692
THAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT-

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.227
THEIR RESEARCH BASED TOOLS AND

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.795
BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD BE

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:36.930
SCALED UP LIKE. USE OF

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:41.568
STRATEGICALLY PLACED CAMERAS OR

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.970
THEN FINALLY- GIVEN THAT THE

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.872
OVERALL CRIME RATE IS RELATIVELY

01:50:45.939 --> 01:50:47.273
LOW I'M PARTICULARLY BY

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.842
HISTORICAL STANDARDS IT COULD BE

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:51.144
REASONABLE TO PRIORITIZE OTHER

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:52.379
PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT ARE

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:54.080
NOT. DIRECTLY RELATED TO CRIME

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:57.484
REDUCTION. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY

01:50:57.550 --> 01:51:00.854
OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND- VERY

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.288
QUICKLY I WILL I WILL JUST

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:04.858
MENTION OUR CONCERNS- ON THIS.

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.993
PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM IN

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.496
PANEL ONE WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.131
THE GRANT PROGRAM AND PANEL TO

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:13.166
BOTH OF WHICH ARE ADDRESSING

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:14.567
ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.736
RETAIL THEFT. AND SPECIFICALLY

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:19.172
WERE CONCERNED THAT THE- GRANT

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:20.240
PROGRAM AS PROPOSED WOULD

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:21.408
PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.543
IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY TO BE A

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.412
SIXTY AFTER THE BUDGET IS

01:51:25.478 --> 01:51:26.446
ENACTED WHICH WOULD MAKE IT.

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.214
VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:29.516
LEAST AT THIS POINT HOW THE

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:30.984
MONEY WOULD ULTIMATELY BE

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:34.320
ALLOCATED AND USED AND IN TURN-

01:51:34.387 --> 01:51:36.523
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ULTIMATELY

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:38.324
THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:39.826
EFFECTIVELY. IT ALSO MAKES IT

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.194
HARD TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:43.463
THAT THE GRANTS WOULD SUPPLANT

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:45.999
LOCAL. FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE IS

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:47.400
UNCLEAR WHETHER THE FUNDING

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:49.569
WOULD GO TOWARD. INCREASING LAW

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:50.737
ENFORCEMENT PATROL OF RETAIL

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:53.106
LOCATIONS. OR BE USED FOR

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:55.942
EXAMPLE TO PURCHASE- CAMERAS OR

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:57.510
OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD.

01:51:57.577 --> 01:51:59.746
ACHIEVE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES- AND

01:51:59.813 --> 01:52:01.448
POTENTIALLY BE A MORE EFFECTIVE

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:03.016
USE OF LIMITED TERM FUNDING.

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.984
THIS IS THIS CONCLUDE MY

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.219
COMMENTS AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:11.691
QUESTIONS. I JUST NEWMAN

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:12.826
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:14.461
WANTED TO REITERATE THAT THE

01:52:14.527 --> 01:52:15.695
GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.230
SPECIFICALLY WITH PANEL ONE IS

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.531
TO KIND OF EMPHASIZE AND

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:19.833
ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE OF

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:20.967
GOVERNMENT APPROACH AND PROVIDE

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:22.602
FUNDING FOR LOCALS TO COMBAT

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:24.838
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- WE THINK

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:27.073
IT'S PART OF A LARGE. LOCAL AND

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.942
STATE KIND OF PACKAGE TO ADDRESS

THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:37.750
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:59.038
PROPOSAL- YES. THANK YOU WE'VE.

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:00.940
AREAS A SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY'RE

01:53:01.007 --> 01:53:02.809
PURCHASING AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:04.944
A C. H. B. TAX TOUGH. C. H. B.

01:53:05.011 --> 01:53:07.080
TASK FORCE. INCLUDING THE

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.915
CENTRAL VALLEY IN SACRAMENTO DO

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.583
WE KNOW IF THESE ARE AREAS WHERE

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.018
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZED

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:15.855
RETAIL THEFT- OR JUST HOW HOW

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:18.925
DID WE MAKE. HOW DID WE GET TO

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:21.895
THAT POSITION CAN WE START THERE

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.030
. SURE JUST A MOMENT TO FINANCE

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:26.166
AGAIN I THINK. WE DECIDED TO

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:46.719
EXPAND THE H. P. DID THOSE.

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:47.787
SPECIFIC LOCATION BECAUSE WE HAD

01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:50.323
SEEN.

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:53.259
DR IN THOSE AREAS ARE THOSE THE

01:53:53.326 --> 01:53:55.495
ONLY AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:53:55.562 --> 01:54:06.072
CHP TASK FORCE. I CAN'T WAIT

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:08.841
THIS SPECIFIC AREA THAT SEEKS

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:10.410
PETER OR DOESN'T COVER SO I'M I

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:12.612
DIFFER TO THEM ON. WHAT PARTS OF

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:17.850
THIS BEST- SO I IT WHICH IS. I

01:54:17.917 --> 01:54:19.752
THINK WE MIGHT THINK I'LL AND

01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:28.861
THEN OF COURSE THAT WE ALL SHE-

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.563
DID HE SAID TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:31.898
WE- BEING RESPONSE TO THEIR

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:33.499
DEFINITELY BEEN AND- IN THE NEWS

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.835
PER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THE

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:37.470
IN THE SMALL. WAY THAT ARE DAHLE

01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:38.838
TAX IN AB. IN A WAY THAT READ

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:40.873
THIS- THOSE HEADLINE AND THAT

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.808
RETAIL THEFT OUT THERE AND SO.

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:43.443
AND SO MY QUESTION IS THAT OUR

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:44.677
LINE OF QUESTIONS ARE COMING

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:46.012
FROM FROM THAT PLACE AND WE

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:48.147
START THERE AND SO THE CENTRAL

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:49.515
VALLEY IN SACRAMENTO MIGHT BE.

01:54:49.582 --> 01:54:52.585
GOOD PLACES TO START IS WANT TO

01:54:52.652 --> 01:54:53.853
MAKE SURE THAT MAYBE YOU. WE'RE

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.721
NOT FORGETTING OTHER PLACES I

01:54:54.787 --> 01:54:56.856
MIGHT NEED THIS AS WELL- AND SO

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:58.925
THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT'S

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:01.060
WITHOUT QUESTION IS COMING FROM

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:02.929
- AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PRIOR

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:05.565
TO A THEME BASED. ON ON

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:06.899
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LIMITED

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.835
GROUP THE STAKEHOLDERS OUT THERE

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:10.737
AND SO THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:12.939
THERE MY SECOND CONCERN IS THAT

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.674
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE ANY

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:16.576
SORT OF METRICS TO ENSURE THAT

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:17.677
THE DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY BEING

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:19.679
USED IN THE WAYS IN THE WAY THAT

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:21.414
WE INTENDED. AND SO THE

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.516
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPEN TO

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.084
FINDING SOME SORT OF REPORTING

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:26.953
REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.656
THAT THE SELLERS ARE BEING USED

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:34.360
APPROPRIATELY. I JUST NEWMAN

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:36.229
PART IN A FINANCE WERE MORE THAN

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:37.797
HAPPY THE ADMINISTRATION IS AND

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.965
PART OF STATE COMMUNITY

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:39.599
CORRECTIONS TO WORK THROUGH THE

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.034
EXECUTIVE STEERING PROCESS AS WE

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.735
DEVELOP THE GRANTS AND KIND OF

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.636
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TO ENSURE

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:45.838
THAT. THE MONEY IS BETTER SPENT

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:47.106
ARE ACCURATELY TRACKING IN KIND

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:48.308
OF REPORTED BY THE LOCAL

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.176
AGENCIES THAT BY FOREIGN IN OUR

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:51.944
ULTIMATELY AWARDED THESE GRANTS.

01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:53.713
SO I SO LET ME BE CLEAR AT WHAT

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.748
MY NEXT QUESTION AND EVEN THIS

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:56.883
ONE THAT WE'RE HOPING TO GET

01:55:56.949 --> 01:55:58.051
THIS INFORMATION BEFORE WE

APPROPRIATE THE SELLERS AND THAT

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.988
AFTER. THE MATTER- IT THINK EVER

THAT INFORMATION AHEAD OF TIME

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:06.526
AND SO WITH THAT MY QUESTION IS.

01:56:06.592 --> 01:56:08.528
WHEN WILL BE WHEN WILL WE BE

01:56:08.594 --> 01:56:10.229

ABOUT HOW. THESE GRANTS WILL

01:56:12.198 --> 01:56:14.233
OCCUR WITH THE FACT THAT THE

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.635
GRANTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:17.537
CAN APPLY FOR WHAT THE

01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:20.406
PERMISSIBLE USE OF THE FUNDING.

01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:21.607
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MEASURE THE

01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:25.745
IMPACT OF THE FUNDING WHEN WILL

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:26.846
WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:28.715
AVAILABLE. IF I MAY A JOB AND

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:30.350
THIS IS KATIE HOW WITH THE-

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:32.185
OFTEN AS THE LARGEST. CAN NEW

01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:34.053
GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT THE BCC

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.556
IS ASKED TO ADMINISTER. THEIR IN

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:38.991
THE PAST BEEN- SOME. PROVISIONAL

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:41.427
LANGUAGE OR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:43.196
THAT REALLY SPELLS OUT WITH SOME

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:44.063
SPECIFICITY. SOME OF THE

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:45.598
LEGISLATIVE GOALS AND SO WE

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:48.201
WOULD BE OF COURSE ABSOLUTELY-

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.436
INTERESTED AND OPEN TO. WORKING

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:51.904
WITH YOU ON SOME OF THOSE

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.706
CRITERIA. THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:56.109
ADD IN WE HEARD YOU ASKED TODAY

01:56:56.175 --> 01:56:57.110
ABOUT. WHAT INFORMATION IS

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:58.978
AVAILABLE ABOUT RATES OF

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:00.246
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT ACROSS

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:01.948
THE STATE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.216
TRY TO PUT SOME OF THAT

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:05.318
INFORMATION TOGETHER. BUT- IN

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:07.987
GENERAL ARE THINGS LIKE- TYPES

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:10.089
OF ACTIVITIES OR PROGRAMS OR

01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:11.557
EVEN TECHNOLOGY IT'S A TRUCK.

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:13.493
THAT MIGHT BE A HIGHER PRIORITY

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:14.560
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.028
LEGISLATURE THOSE KINDS OF

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:18.765
ADDITIONAL- DETAILED RULES COULD

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.533
CERTAINLY BE FELT TEN AS PART OF

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.034
BUDGET PROCESS. FOR THE GRANT

01:57:22.101 --> 01:57:23.870
SPOKE OUT. AND THEN I THINK THAT

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.505
THE WAY THAT I WOULD LEAST LIKE

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:27.774
TO AT LEAST OFFER SOME-

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.809
INSURANCE PERHAPS IS THAT SINCE

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:31.778
THIS IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT-

01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:34.247
ANY. LOOKED SECTION THAT WANTS

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:35.782
TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDING NEEDS

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:36.849
TO PROVIDE A PERSUASIVE

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:37.850
STATEMENT OF NEED. AND THAT

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:40.219
WOULD BE ONE OF THE RATING

01:57:40.286 --> 01:57:42.021
CRITERIA- ON WHICH THEIR SUPPORT

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:43.723
. THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.158
THAT GOAL CERTAINLY AND THE

01:57:45.224 --> 01:57:47.593
STRUCTURE OF OUR- DC GRANTED.

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:51.164
PROCESS IS TO SAY LET'S HAVE A

01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:53.266
LOOK. ON PROPOSALS B. AS- BASED

01:57:53.332 --> 01:57:55.234
ON THE NEED THAT THAT COMES IN

01:57:55.301 --> 01:57:57.470
ON THE PROPOSAL'S. IT'S THOSE

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.005
TWO DISTINCT THINGS CERTAINLY

01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:00.873
ADDITIONAL. LANGUAGE CAN BE

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.675
ADDED HERE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:06.546
AND- WE WOULD HAVE. HAD IT.

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:08.481
PROCESS THAT. THAT WOULD SERVE

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:10.883
TO- FUNDED PROGRAMS WERE THE

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.251
HIGHEST NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED.

01:58:12.318 --> 01:58:13.152
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:14.921
PLANTATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:15.888
THINGS THAT THE L. A. ARE

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:18.224
RAISED. WE ALWAYS SPECIFIED IN

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.459
GRANT AGREEMENT THAT THE FUNDING

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.093
HAS TO BE FOR NEW ACTIVITIES.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.895
AND CAN'T SUPPLY. SO I WANT TO.

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:31.037
JUST MENTION THAT AS. WELL

01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:33.172
THANKS. DO WE A MATRIX OF. A

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:34.540
PERSUASIVE. APPLICATION MY-

01:58:34.607 --> 01:58:36.075
HELPED HER STICTION SALES WORRY

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:38.578
ABOUT EQUITY- ONE- SEPARATE FOR

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.746
THAT MAKING SURE THAT. IT WASN'T

01:58:40.813 --> 01:58:43.316
JUST PERSUASIVE AND PAPER BUT

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:44.317
THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE IN

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:46.819
PRACTICE. AS WELL AS WELL AS WE

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:48.554
CONTINUE TO THIS PROCESS THOSE

01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:49.989
DETAILS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:52.725
IMPORTANT TO US. AND THIS.

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:56.395
BHOSLE COMPLETELY FAIR QUESTION-

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:58.097
WE CAN BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU

01:58:58.164 --> 01:58:59.298
WITH EXAMPLES FROM OTHER GRANTS

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:01.534
BUT I THINK THE CONTENT OF THIS

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:05.771
ONE IS DISTINCT SO- YOU KNOW.

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.640
WHATEVER THE PRIORITY CERTAINLY

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:10.142
EQUITY IS IMPORTANT AS WELL-

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:11.143
THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONCE

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.712
DEVELOP THEN WE WOULD THEN HAVE

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:15.348
THE GRANTS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.283
FLOW DIRECTLY FROM WHATEVER THE

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.218
LEGISLATURE- AND THE BUDGET

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:22.421
PROCESS HAS DICTATED I HOPE THAT

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:25.391
MAKES SENSE. SO LET'S JUST THE

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:28.060
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WILL

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:30.096
WORK WITH US TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:33.432
HAVE HERE- METRICS- TO ENSURE

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:35.067
THE FUNDING IS BEING USED

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:37.003
PROPERLY AND CLEAR METRICS FOR

HOW YOU QUALIFY FOR OUR GRAND

THE SISAL STRANDS BEFORE. WE

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:44.410
ADOPT THIS BUDGET. YOU CERTAINLY

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:46.279
CAN'T- TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE THE

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.581
SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL GRANTS IS-

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:50.750
LEFT FOR A COMMITTEE OF A

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:51.984
VARIETY OF SUBJECT MATTER

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:54.921
EXPERTS- TO DETERMINE TO WORK

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:55.688
THROUGH AND DETERMINE BUT IF THE

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:58.324
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SAY YOU

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:00.059
KNOW THAT TO SET SOME LIMITS ON

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:01.627
THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WITHIN

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:05.298
YOUR- YOU KNOW. ABILITY TO DO.

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:06.832
SO TO BE CLEAR THOUGHT ABOUT

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.668
SETTING LIMITS OF SO FORTH WHICH

02:00:08.734 --> 02:00:10.503
IS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

THESE ISSUES I HAVE MORE

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.814
QUESTIONS BUT ACTUALLY WANT TO

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.652
QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY. YEAH

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:29.021
THANK YOU I'D FIRST OF ALL I

02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:30.723
WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:32.625
APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR FOR

02:00:32.692 --> 02:00:34.093
OF KNOWLEDGE IN. THIS HUGE

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.362
PROBLEM- THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:38.864
PROBLEM. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:41.534
I BELIEVE THAT PART OF OUR-

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.803
FRUSTRATION. IS AS- WAS

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:46.672
ANNOUNCED EARLIER THAT. THE THE

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.674
NUMBERS ARE INDICATING THAT-

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.977
THIS IS NOT AS BIG A PROBLEM AS

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:51.777
IT REALLY IS AND I THINK IT'S

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.646
BECAUSE WE HAVE. LACK OF REAL

02:00:53.713 --> 02:00:57.216
DATA. ON SHOWING HOW WIDESPREAD

02:00:57.283 --> 02:00:59.819
AND HOW DEEP. THIS PROBLEM HAS

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:03.255
BECOME- I KNOWS TO PUBLIC SAFETY

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:06.592
A REALITY THAT- MY DAUGHTER WHO

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:08.160
RECENTLY WAS EMPLOYED BY

02:01:08.227 --> 02:01:10.029
RETAILER. WAS INSTRUCTED BY HER

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:12.398
SUPERVISION. THAT WHEN THEY

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:14.467
ACTUALLY OBSERVE SOMEBODY.

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:17.803
STEALING A GARMENT THAT THEY

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:19.572
WERE NOT EVEN TO BRING ATTENTION

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:21.674
TO IT. MUCH LESS REPORTED. SO I

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.909
COULD TELL YOU THAT'S THE

02:01:23.976 --> 02:01:24.777
REALITY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.412
RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S BECAUSE

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.714
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID- THEY DON'T

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.950
WANT VIOLENCE THEY DON'T WANT

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:32.885
ALL THE NEGATIVE- CONSEQUENCES

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:34.487
OF REPORTING AND SO WHAT I'M

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:37.289
HOPING IS THAT- BY THIS

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:39.892
PROGRAMMING. BRINGING ATTENTION

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:41.627
TO THIS PROBLEM THAT MAYBE SOME

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.129
OF THE RETAILERS WILL BE MORE

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:45.464
ENGAGED TO COOPERATE. AND TO

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:46.832
GIVE US SOME REAL DATA SO THAT

02:01:46.899 --> 02:01:48.734
WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:51.504
OF THIS PROBLEM. AND WE CAN A

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:54.273
DESK ADDRESS IT IN A MEANINGFUL

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.408
WAY. AND YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:56.308
FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:58.678
HOT OF MONEY. SO I'M HOPING THAT

02:01:58.744 --> 02:02:01.247
WE WILL DIRECTED IN A WAY THAT

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:03.449
WE CAN ACTUALLY COLLECT- GOOD

02:02:03.516 --> 02:02:06.052
INFORMATION. AND WE CAN TRACK

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:08.421
OUTCOMES THAT CAN HELP US. OF

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:09.555
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IN SOME

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:11.824
KIND OF MEANINGFUL WAY AND NOT

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.793
JUST SUPERFICIALLY- I'M VERY

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:15.995
VERY EXCITED FOR. THE BEGINNING

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:18.330
OF SOMETHING. THAT REALLY NEEDS

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:20.199
TO BE ADDRESSED- BECAUSE WE'RE

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:22.268
ALL IMPACTED BY IT ONE WAY OR

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:24.170
ANOTHER AND SO. I'M THANKFUL FOR

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:25.471
THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING THIS

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:29.141
AND IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE-

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:31.610
OF AS MEANINGFUL AS- WE COULD

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:34.714
MAKE IT BUT- IT'S A STEP IN THE

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:35.881
RIGHT DIRECTION SO I'M VERY

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:37.583
THANKFUL FOR IT. AND I JUST HOPE

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:39.518
THAT WE WILL BE SMART AND THE

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:40.853
WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT THIS

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.588
PROGRAM AND THAT WE WILL ADDRESS

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.623
IT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY HAS

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.825
MEANING. AND WHAT KIND OF

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:47.927
SERVICE A DETRIMENT TO THOSE WHO

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:52.131
ARE CHOOSING TO- EXPLOIT OTHER

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:55.568
PEOPLE- ESPECIALLY RETAILERS

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:56.969
THAT IT'S BECOME VERY VERY

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:59.105
HURTFUL AND I'M VERY EXCITED FOR

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:03.542
SOME GOOD OUTCOMES. THANK YOU MR

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:08.280
LACKEY AND- NOT PURSUE THIS WITH

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:10.416
THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL TO ME.

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.051
AS THE AUTHOR OF THE ORGANIZED

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:14.153
RETAIL THEFT BILL AND THE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:17.623
INDIVIDUAL WHO. THEN WHEN IT

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:21.393
SUNSET IT GOT IT RE. PATTERSON

02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:24.830
SAID EXTENDED- I WAS OVER-

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:27.466
OVERJOYED WHEN THE GOVERNOR CAME

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:29.769
OUT WITH ADDITIONAL MONEY NOT

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:32.171
ONLY FOR THIS PROGRAM BUT THEY

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:34.273
ALSO SAY THAT IN ITS PRESENT

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.576
FORM IT WAS WORKING UNDER CHP

02:03:37.643 --> 02:03:39.278
AND I DON'T THINK THE CHP GETS

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:41.080
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THE INCREDIBLE

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.949
JOB THAT THEY'VE DONE IN IN IN

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.618
IN THE SUCCESSES THAT THEY HAVE

02:03:45.684 --> 02:03:47.753
BOTH BEEN. PROSECUTING PEOPLE

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.688
WITH FELONIES AND DEALING WITH

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.590
PEOPLE ON THE MISDEMEANOR LEVEL

02:03:51.657 --> 02:03:54.760
AND GETTING THEM TO PROGRAMS-

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:56.629
AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

02:03:56.695 --> 02:04:00.132
WHERE SOMEONE WROTE

02:04:00.199 --> 02:04:00.866
ORGANIZATIONS DO AN EXCEPTIONAL

02:04:00.933 --> 02:04:02.635
JOB. AND WE JUST KIND OF IGNORED

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.703
IT AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.438
WE COMMEND THE CALIFORNIA

02:04:06.505 --> 02:04:07.673
HIGHWAY PATROL FOR THE FOR THEIR

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:11.577
ROLE. IN GETTING THIS DONE- A

02:04:11.644 --> 02:04:13.913
BUDGET THAT THE VOTING THE REAL

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:15.614
PROBLEM IS- THE CONFLICTING

02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:17.516
INFORMATION WHETHER OR NOT IT

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:20.286
WHETHER IT'S HIGHER OR LOWER-

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:22.321
THE REAL PROBLEM IS FEAR. IT

02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:24.924
COULD BE WE COULD BE AT ZERO.

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.726
AND PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CRIME IS

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:31.630
UP AND FEARFUL. THIS EMOTIONAL.

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.666
YOU KNOW PERCEPTION IS REALITY

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:36.101
AND IF THEY BELIEVE THAT- CRIME

02:04:36.168 --> 02:04:38.337
IS UP AND THE FEAR OF CRIME THEN

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:40.306
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN. WE CAN

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:42.174
DO ABOUT IT STATISTICALLY RITUAL

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:44.009
THE MODEST OF TEXAS YOU WANT BUT

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.245
IF THEY ARE AFRAID. TO COME

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:48.347
OTHER HOMES BECAUSE THEY SEE

02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:49.481
HOMELESS PEOPLE WALKING AROUND

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.884
OR A LOOK ON THE TV NAY C. SMASH

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:54.687
AND GRABS- THAT IS THAT IT AND

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:56.956
IT'S REAL. LET'S LET'S FACE IT

02:04:57.022 --> 02:04:59.658
THAT IS A REAL REAL FEAR AND I

02:04:59.725 --> 02:05:01.727
THINK THAT'S THE DAILY TIMES

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:03.295
POLL SHOWS THAT. PEOPLE REALLY

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:06.232
DO FEEL IT. AT THE- AGREEMENTS

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.133
LACKEY THE GOVERNOR WE NEED TO

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.468
BE THANKING THE GOVERNOR'S I

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:11.704
THINK HE HE UNDERSTANDS THAT

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:14.406
THIS DATA CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:15.841
US NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS

02:05:15.908 --> 02:05:17.977
IS AFTER. TO GET THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.645
INVOLVED TO GET THE GOVERNOR'S

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:22.248
OFFICE INVOLVED AND- COMMITTEE

LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE-

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:27.319
ACTIVIST GROUPS INVOLVED TO GO

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:32.124
AT THIS ORGANIZED RETAIL. THEFT

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.260
OF BRAIN. ALL THE- AND I'M GONNA

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.527
REMEMBER WHAT MISS HOWARD TOLD

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:38.197
US AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A

02:05:38.264 --> 02:05:39.665
BORDER STATE AND COMMUNITY

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:41.901
CORRECTIONS. THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:45.471
DOES HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOME KIND

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:48.007
OF GUARD RAILS AND DIRECTION. IF

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.808
FEDERAL CRIMINAL MISCHIEF IT IS

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:51.410
MR LACKEY REMEMBERS ANY OTHER

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.846
BOARD MEMBERS REMEMBER- WE HAD

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:56.382
ASKED B. S. YOU SEE ABOUT

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:57.082
ANOTHER PROGRAM THEY WERE GIVING

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:59.685
OUT GRANTS FOR. AN KENNEDY

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.220
ANSWER CAME BACK THE

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:03.923
LEGISLATURE. TOLD HIM JUST TO DO

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.891
THE REPORT TO PUT HIM UP ON A

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:07.593
SHELF. WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID.

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.895
WHICH IS WHAT WE TELL THEM TO DO

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:10.896
WE DID NOT ASK FOR THE

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:11.997
ACCOUNTABILITY METRONET AFTER TO

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:14.199
SYNTHESIZE IT AND COME BACK WITH

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:17.002
DATA TO THIS GROUP. ABOUT HOW

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.836
EFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR GRANT

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:20.773
PROGRAM WAS AND SO SHE'S

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.975
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF WE'RE GOING

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:25.077
TO GET THIS RIGHT WE HAVE TO

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:26.445
JOIN WITH THE GOVERNOR TO PUT

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:28.781
DOWN WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. A LOT

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.182
OF THIS HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:31.917
MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:33.652
TOWARD ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT.

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:36.188
NOT ONLY IS THE GOALS BUT JUST

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:38.724
CLEAR RESOURCES OF WHAT NEEDS TO

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.060
BE DONE AND WHAT IS THE HIGHEST

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.262
PRIORITIES ON DOWN- AND OF

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.897
COURSE IMPLEMENTATION.

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:47.900
IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:50.369
IMPLEMENTATION OF. THE REASON

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:52.304
WHY I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR HAD

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:56.408
HERE TO CITIES WITHWITH CHP

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:59.778
BECAUSE CHP IS TAKING THE LEAD

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.046
ON THIS. THESE GRANTS ARE

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.982
SUPPOSED TO GO TO A LOCAL LAW

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:04.717
ENFORCEMENT TO KIND OF DO THE

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:05.884
SAME THING IN CONJUNCTION WITH

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.953
C. H. P. OR DO IT ON THEIR OWN

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.456
WE HAVE AN TO FIND AT THE SO

02:07:10.522 --> 02:07:12.057
WE'RE PUTTING THAT ON B. SEC.

02:07:12.124 --> 02:07:13.826
THE CANADA FIND IT WE PROBABLY

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:15.794
NEED TO HELP THEM TO FIND IT TOO

02:07:15.861 --> 02:07:17.062
BECAUSE NOT EVERY LAW

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.398
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY BELIEVES IN

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:22.067
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- THEY

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:23.102
BELIEVE FELONIES LOCKING UP

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:24.503
PEOPLE. THROWING AWAY THE KEY

02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:26.138
AND THAT'S IT NASTA THAT'S HOW

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:30.442
YOU SOLVE IT I THINK IS A MULTI.

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:32.011
APPROACH AND THAT'S WHAT THE

02:07:32.077 --> 02:07:33.879
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BUILDERS.

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.180
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY IS

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:38.283
SUPPOSED TO DO BUT- AT THE END

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:40.486
OF THE DAY- WE DO HAVE TO

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:44.957
PROVIDE MORE. MEAT TO IT AND-

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:47.059
AND HOPEFULLY MISS HOWARD CAN

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:49.161
COMMENT ON WHAT ELSE SHE NEEDS

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:50.696
SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:53.132
YOU SO THAT AFTER YEAR IT GOES

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:55.000
BY IF WE ASK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:57.936
MEASURES WHAT WHAT IS BEEN DONE.

02:07:58.003 --> 02:08:00.239
SO THAT. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:02.641
OTHER SIDE. WE'RE NOT HAVING

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.777
THIS DEBATE FOR EXAMPLE ON. IS

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:06.378
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIMES

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:08.280
GOING UP GOING DOWN THE IN

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:12.351
BETWEEN A LEVELED OUT THAT WE-

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.152
THAT MAYBE THAT'S PART OF WHAT

THIS DONE. LIKE TECHNOLOGY. I

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:38.811
WANT TO GET AWAY WITH SOME OF

02:08:38.877 --> 02:08:40.879
THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ON

FUTURE SPACE AGE PROBABLY WAY

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:50.923
ABOVE MY TECHNOLOGY LEVEL THAT

TAKEN IT THAT COULD BE PART OF

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:01.033
THE GRANT. THE DALLAS MAY BE

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.568
PART OF GIVING MORE MONEY TO

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.169
RETAILERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:04.703
TECHNOLOGY- WORKING WITH

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:06.672
RETAILERS DO DUE TO TECHNOLOGY

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:09.541
SO THAT THEY CAN DO THAT. LET'S

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:11.443
BE SMART. ABOUT THE GRANT

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:14.580
PROGRAM. AND MAKE IT MORE ROBUST

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:18.150
AND- ULTIMATELY MAKE SURE

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:20.252
THEY'RE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE. AND

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:22.821
THAT THAT WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE OF

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:25.557
CHP OR WHETHER IT'S A OTHERS

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.626
USED TO WORK MORE FOR THINKING

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.895
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY I WANT TO

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:31.296
USE ALL THESE TECHNIQUES AND

02:09:31.363 --> 02:09:32.965
WANTED TO EVERYTHING THAT THE

ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT BILL

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:37.102
DOES. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:38.504
COBBLE TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:40.572
IS OUT OF THE BOX MICHAEL TO

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:42.307
WITH THEIR NORMALLY DO BUT THEY

02:09:42.374 --> 02:09:44.276
DO SOMETHING THAT- INVENTIVE IN

02:09:44.343 --> 02:09:46.011
NEW AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:47.813
MONEY IS REALLY. REALLY FOR AND

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:50.883
SO I WILL ASK MISS HOWARD AND

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:52.951

GUARDRAILS WE SHOULD PUT ON HERE

02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:59.658
ARE NO GUARD RAILS OR WHAT WE

02:09:59.725 --> 02:10:02.327
NEED TO DO. TO MAKE. FOR ME THE

02:10:02.394 --> 02:10:04.663
MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS

02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:06.064
THE GRANT PROGRAM. TO THE GRANT

02:10:06.131 --> 02:10:08.667
PROGRAM ULTIMATELY STARTS BY N.

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.002
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:12.304
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. ONCE YOU

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:14.206
START TO GET BUY IN FROM BOTH.

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:15.240
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:17.276
COMMUNITY ARE ORGANIZED RETAIL

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:18.744
THEFT I THINK WE'LL GET WE'LL

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:22.314
GET A LONG WAY TOWARD REDUCING.

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:24.116
OR AT LEAST IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.318
AND THEN REDUCING THAT AND SO

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:29.388
THAT- EVERYONE FEELS SAFE.

02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:30.556
BECAUSE AGAIN OUR OUR REPEAT

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:33.358
THIS AGAIN THE FEAR. IS

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:37.129
ABSOLUTELY- RIO AND HOPEFULLY WE

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.697
CAN COME UP WITH SOME BEST

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:40.432
PRACTICES. ON HOW WE DEAL WITH

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:43.135
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- AS WE

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.903

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT. ACROSS

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:51.877
COUNTY LINES WHEN PEOPLE STEAL

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:53.812
SOMETHING I BELIEVE WE WERE

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:55.380
TALKING ABOUT THE DOJ. BEING

02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:57.349
ABLE TO HANDLE THAT WELL LET'S

ACROSS THOSE COUNTY LINE.

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.163
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.165

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:15.300

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:46.338
COMPLETE THE WHOLE PICTURE.

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:48.940
JANKY THERE WILL BRING A BATCH

02:15:49.007 --> 02:15:50.275
COMMITTEE VIBE MY ONLY QUESTION

02:15:50.342 --> 02:15:52.911
IS JUST. JUST FROM AN

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:55.113

YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS

02:15:58.016 --> 02:15:59.217
MONEY TO GO IN. AND GET IN A

02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:00.585
COORDINATOR TO COORDINATE WITH

02:16:00.652 --> 02:16:02.787
THE DA LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:16:02.854 --> 02:16:05.257
JUDICIAL SO THAT THEY IN IN

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:08.326
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS- ARE IS

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:11.129
IT. HOW DO YOU CAN I MEAN YOU

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:11.897
NEED TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO

02:16:11.963 --> 02:16:13.865
PAY FOR WHAT THAT MIGHT BE THE

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:15.767
BEST WAY TO SAY IT. AND I THINK

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:17.302
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GETTING SOME

02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:21.106

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:38.623
THE THIS IS KATIE HOWARD WITH

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:39.758
THE BSE THEME MY UNDERSTANDING

02:16:39.824 --> 02:16:41.960
IS THAT THIS FUNDING IS TO GO TO

02:16:42.027 --> 02:16:43.595

TEAM- AND- IN TERMS OF WHETHER

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:51.136
THERE WOULD BE WITHIN THE TEN

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:52.671
MILLION IF SOME OF THAT FUNDING

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:54.573
WOULD GO TO OTHER ENTITIES ARE

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.374
JURISDICTIONS- I DON'T THINK

02:16:56.441 --> 02:16:58.076
WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THAT LEVEL OF

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.544
DETAIL IN THE CONVERSATION AS

02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:02.547
YET BUT THE PROPOSAL IS TO FIND-

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:06.084

02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:28.106
NUMBER OF CASES. MISTER LUCKY I

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:31.176
DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:35.447
AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY SO YOU YOU

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:37.415
I KNOW DISCOVERED RECALL BACK

TO BALANCE THE NUMBER OF CASES

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:53.498
BUT- THAT THIS WILL GO TO BUT

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:55.166
ALSO. ARE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT

SEEMS LIKE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

02:18:04.676 --> 02:18:08.246
COVER TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND SO.

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:10.715

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:13.551
APPROXIMATION- SO WE KNOW THAT

CARRY OUT THOSE PROSECUTIONS

02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:19.791
ESPECIALLY THROUGH VERTICAL

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:25.263
PROCESS. THE MOST RETARDED. MY

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.565
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSAL IS

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:29.300
THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH TO ADDRESS

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:31.436
A BACKLOG OF MR JONES SAWYER BUT

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:33.705
RATHER THAT IT'S TO BUILD THE

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:34.406
CAPACITY WITHIN DISTRICT

02:18:34.472 --> 02:18:36.541
ATTORNEY'S OFFICES TO FORM

02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:06.471
THAT PERIOD OF TIME ABOUT YOU

KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN

02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:09.908
HOW SUCCESSFUL IT'S BEEN IF THAT

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:11.543
TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS A PRETTY

02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:13.478
GOOD ESTIMATE AS TO STATEWIDE

MILLION DOLLARS WE MAY RECEIVE.

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.558

APPLICATIONS SO UNTIL WE LAUNCH

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:33.231
IT WE CAN'T REALLY BE SURE MY

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:34.933
SENSE IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:36.601
ABOUT LIKE TEN MILLION WAS A

02:19:36.668 --> 02:19:37.936
REASONABLE PLACE TO START

02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:39.170
THERE'S NO GUESSWORK INVOLVED TO

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:41.139
BE SURE OF ONE FINAL QUESTION

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.308
FRACTURE BLACKIE HAVE WE START

ANY INPUT AT ALL FROM THE

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:46.644
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WITHIN THE

STATE. GET THEIR. THEIR INPUT ON

02:19:53.384 --> 02:19:54.686
THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. I AM

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:56.654
NOT SURE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:57.489
FINANCE I HAVE BEEN FORMALLY

02:19:57.555 --> 02:19:59.524
DONE THAT AT THIS POINT. DEAL

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.092
WITH MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION

02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:02.761
HI JUSTIN EDELMAN DEPARTMENT OF

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:04.929
FINANCE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ACTIVELY

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:06.865
YOU KNOW COLLABORATING WITH THE-

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.433
SPECIFIC DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:10.068
THIS PROPOSAL IT'S LARGELY.

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:12.137
DRIVEN OFF OF CHP'S INFORMATION

02:20:12.203 --> 02:20:13.972
ON THEIR KIND OF ARRESTS AND

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:16.074
WHAT THEIR YOU KNOW.

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:17.242
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:19.744
BUT AGAIN THE INTENTION WAS TO

02:20:19.811 --> 02:20:21.312
SIT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND KIND

02:20:21.379 --> 02:20:23.648
OF BUILDING UP A COMPLEX. WORK

02:20:23.715 --> 02:20:26.484
OF. WHO ARE MORE MORE SPECIFIC

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:28.753
WE FOCUSED ON ORGANIZED RETAIL

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:30.522
THEFT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.924
PROSECUTIONS CAN OCCUR LOCALLY.

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.526
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:36.327
WOULD BE A LOGICAL SUGGESTION TO

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:38.429
INCLUDE THEM IN SOME. PART OF

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:42.000
THIS PROCESS. BUT THIS COULD BE

02:20:42.066 --> 02:20:44.068
A WAY TO KICKSTART. APRIL

02:20:44.135 --> 02:20:45.870
PROGRAM IN DIFFERENT DAYS

02:20:45.937 --> 02:20:48.706
OFFICE- I THE CONCERN IT

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:50.475
PROBABLY IS JUST SO IF YOU'RE

02:20:50.542 --> 02:20:53.678
LISTENING IS. I THINK IS MAKING

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:56.147
SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY

02:20:56.214 --> 02:20:58.049
IN THERE TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER

02:20:58.116 --> 02:21:01.352
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS IS

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:03.555
. IN AN HOUR BAR IT'S TOO MUCH

02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:05.657
MONEY THAT IT COULD BE HANDLED

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:06.758
INTERNALLY WITH EXISTING

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:08.526
RESOURCES AND MONEY AND THEY

02:21:08.593 --> 02:21:10.528
ONLY NEED FIVE MILLION WHICH

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:11.963
MEANS AND THE REST WILL GO BACK

02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:14.265
TO GENERAL FUND BUT IT WAS. THE

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:16.034
QUESTION WAS MORE IF YOU NEED TO

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.135
TWENTY. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:19.704
BE. UPSET IT GIVING YOU MORE

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:21.472
MONEY IF WE KNEW THIS WOULD

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:22.841
HELP. IN REDUCING ORGANIZED

02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:25.143
RETAIL THEFT THAT'S- IF YOU GET

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:27.412
A SENSE OF WHERE THESE QUESTIONS

02:21:27.478 --> 02:21:29.247
ARE COMING FROM. THAT'S VERY

02:21:29.314 --> 02:21:34.352
HELPFUL. OKAY WITH THAT WOULD GO

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:37.222

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.298
ACHIEVING. THE INTENDED PUBLIC

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:28.766
SAFETY GOALS AND ALONG THOSE

02:23:28.833 --> 02:23:30.034
LINES WE FOUND THAT CERTAIN

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:32.036
PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:33.838
PACKAGE INCLUDING THIS ONE.

02:23:33.905 --> 02:23:35.740
MIGHT NOT BE STRUCTURED TO

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:37.842
ACHIEVE THE INTENDED OUTCOMES.

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:39.344
AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:41.879
THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REDUCE

02:23:41.946 --> 02:23:43.848
OPIOID OVERDOSES AS WELL AS

02:23:43.915 --> 02:23:45.650
CRIMES AND VIOLENCE RELATED TO

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:47.285
THE SMUGGLING AND DISTRIBUTION

02:23:47.352 --> 02:23:49.454
OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. HOWEVER ON THE

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:51.923
FLIP SIDE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:53.524
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:55.293
LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS FOR

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:56.794

CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING.

02:24:00.765 --> 02:24:02.100
WHICH IS A SEPARATE AND

02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:03.768
REASONABLE ST MICHAEL BUT

02:24:03.835 --> 02:24:04.669
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:07.205

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:09.974
THAT THE STATE'S PRIORITY IS

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:11.909
REDUCING OVERALL OVERDOSE DEATHS

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:13.945
LINKED TO ILLEGAL DRUGS THIS

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:15.313
PROPOSAL AS IT'S CURRENTLY

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.948
STRUCTURED MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:20.084
WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT. SO WE'RE

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:21.486
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:24.422

TOO MUCH IN ONE BASKET OR THAT

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:48.713
MAYBE SHOULD FOCUS IN ON WHICH

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.748
IS A BIG PROBLEM GROWS IN THE

02:24:50.815 --> 02:24:54.886

02:25:18.109 --> 02:25:20.545
OUTCOMES AND SO IN REVIEWING OUR

02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:21.679
REVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:24.282
PACKAGE. THE GOAL SEEMS TO BE

02:25:24.348 --> 02:25:26.451
REDUCING OPIOID DEATHS LINKED TO

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:28.553
ILLEGAL DRUGS. ON THE FLIP SIDE

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:30.421
THAN WHAT WE'RE BALANCING OFF

02:25:30.488 --> 02:25:31.556
IS- AS REFERENCE THE PROGRAM IS

02:25:31.622 --> 02:25:33.091
OVER SUBSCRIBED SUBSCRIBED AND

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:35.026
THERE ARE LOTS OF REQUESTS FOR

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:37.328
ASSISTANCE. THE REQUEST THOUGH-

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:38.830
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE VAST

02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:40.398
MAJORITY RELATES TO ILLEGAL

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:42.467
CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND

02:25:42.533 --> 02:25:44.802
TRAFFICKING AND SO THAT'S WHY

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:46.270
WE'RE SAYING THAT- THE

02:25:46.337 --> 02:25:47.238
LEGISLATURE IN THINKING ABOUT

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.140
ITS PRIORITY WANT TO MAKE SURE

THAT THE MONEY IS ALIGNED WITH

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:52.009
THE GOAL THE SPECIFIC GOAL AN

02:25:52.076 --> 02:25:53.611
OUTCOME THAT'S DESIRED AND SO IF

02:25:53.678 --> 02:25:57.815
THE GOAL. IS TO REDUCE. OPIOID

02:25:57.882 --> 02:25:59.016
DEATHS OR REDUCE DRUG THAT'S

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:01.352
TIED TO ILLEGAL DRUGS YOU MIGHT

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:02.620

PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:08.092
ACCOMPLISH THAT. OKAY SO IF WE

02:26:08.159 --> 02:26:09.994
WANTED TO RESTRUCTURE IT TO JUST

02:26:10.061 --> 02:26:14.499
DEAL WITH. ILLEGAL GROWS. AND SO

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:16.534
A WHOLE TWENTY MILLION. WITH

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:21.305
THAT MAKE. SOME KIND OF SENSE SO

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:23.007
THEY HAD A PROGRAM THAT COULD

02:26:23.074 --> 02:26:25.376
WELL DELINEATED WHAT EACH STEP

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:27.011
THAT WOULD BE SO WE DO

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:27.945
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TARGETING

02:26:28.012 --> 02:26:29.547
ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION

02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:30.848
TRAFFICKING IS A REASONABLE GOAL

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:32.016
IS JUST A DIFFERENT STATEWIDE

02:26:32.083 --> 02:26:33.451
GOAL AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:35.286
ABOUT ALL OF YOUR DIFFERENT

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:36.587
PRIORITIES PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:37.688

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:56.447
INTERESTED IN TARGETING

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:58.115
ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT THAT IS

02:30:58.182 --> 02:30:59.483
SPECIFICALLY COORDINATED BY

02:30:59.550 --> 02:31:02.386
CRIMINAL GANGS AND NETWORKS. DOJ

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:04.155
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BETTER AND

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:06.157
TO T. TWO EVENTS EACH P. TO

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.158
ADMINISTER THESE TYPES OF

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:09.293
PROGRAMS. GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.628
SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE IN

02:31:10.694 --> 02:31:12.329
MANAGING DEDICATED TASK FORCES

02:31:12.396 --> 02:31:14.298
AS WELL AS MANAGING THOSE THAT

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:17.301
CONSIST OF FEDERAL STATE AND

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:19.270
LOCAL PARTNERS. DOJ ALSO EMPLOYS

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:21.972
BOTH- INVESTIGATOR PERSONAL AS

02:31:22.039 --> 02:31:23.507
WELL AS ATTORNEYS WHICH COULD

02:31:23.574 --> 02:31:25.576
HELP WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND

02:31:25.643 --> 02:31:27.178
PROSECUTION OF THOSE CASES

02:31:27.244 --> 02:31:30.114
SUCCESSFULLY- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:32.450
THAT ON THE CHP FRONTS- THERE

02:31:32.516 --> 02:31:33.984
COULD BE SOME STAFFING ISSUES

02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:36.420
THAT COULD IMPACT. THE

02:31:36.487 --> 02:31:37.688
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWO NEW

02:31:37.755 --> 02:31:40.024
ONES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH VACANCY

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:41.525
RATE AND SO IN THE SHORT RUN OUR

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:43.627
UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT WOULD BE

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:45.763
GOING TO OVERTIME. RATHER THAN

02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:48.799
DEDICATED OFFICERS WHICH COULD

02:31:48.866 --> 02:31:50.100
IMPACT THE OUTCOMES. THE

02:31:50.167 --> 02:31:51.969
TURNING- ARE. TO THE DOJ TASK

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:54.171
FORCE PROGRAM. THAT IS ONE WHERE

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:55.072
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

02:31:55.139 --> 02:31:56.774
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING

02:31:56.841 --> 02:31:58.042
THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT WOULD

02:31:58.108 --> 02:32:00.277
MAINTAIN DOJ'S PARTICIPATION IN

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.079
EIGHT EXISTING TASK FORCES. AND

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.948
THESE TYPES OF TASK FORCES CAN

02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:06.050
BE A REALLY COST EFFECTIVE WAY.

02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:07.651
OF ADDRESSING COMPLEX OR MULTI

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:09.753
JURISDICTIONAL CRIMES THAT HAVE

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:12.957
BOTH STATE AND REGIONAL IMPACT.

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:15.793
AND SO- A BIG PART OF THIS IS-

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.094
YOU KNOW EACH OF THE

02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:17.728
PARTICIPATING AGENCIES FEDERAL

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.363
STATE OR LOCAL GENERALLY COVER

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:21.599
THEIR OWN COSTS- WHICH THEN

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:23.067
PROVIDES INCENTIVE THAT THE

02:32:23.133 --> 02:32:24.768
CRIMES THAT ARE SELECTED WITHIN

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:26.737
EACH REGION. ARE THOSE THAT ARE

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:28.539
PRIORITIZED BY EACH OF THE

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:29.507
PARTICIPATING MEMBERS GENERALLY

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:32.142
THE MOST PRESSING THE MOST

02:32:32.209 --> 02:32:34.245
COMPLEX FEDERA. SO MY COLLEAGUE

02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:35.579
MISTER O'NEILL MENTIONED THAT

02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:37.081
THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES THAT

02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:37.615
POTENTIALLY COULD

02:32:37.681 --> 02:32:39.083
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:41.418
CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. SO ONE OF

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:42.419
THE OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:32:42.486 --> 02:32:44.355
CONSIDERATION IF ADDRESSING THIS

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:45.956
AND THAT COULD BE AS A PRIORITY

02:32:46.023 --> 02:32:47.591
FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS TO

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:49.593
CONSIDER EXPANDING. THIS PROGRAM

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:51.395
BECAUSE IT OPERATES REGIONALLY.

02:32:51.462 --> 02:32:52.830
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD HAVE

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:54.298
INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

02:32:54.365 --> 02:32:56.166
THE COSTS WOULD BE SHARED. BUT

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:56.967
THE CASES THAT ARE BEING

02:32:57.034 --> 02:32:58.969
ADDRESSED ARE- YOU KNOW WATER

02:32:59.036 --> 02:33:00.704
IMPACTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:02.006
AND THE STATE WOULD ALSO BENEFIT

02:33:02.072 --> 02:33:03.974
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE PAYING

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:04.742
FOR THE FULL COST OF

02:33:04.808 --> 02:33:05.576
INVESTIGATING THESE TYPES OF

02:33:05.643 --> 02:33:07.912
CASES AND SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER

02:33:07.978 --> 02:33:08.479
OPTION FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:33:08.546 --> 02:33:11.882
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. GOOD
