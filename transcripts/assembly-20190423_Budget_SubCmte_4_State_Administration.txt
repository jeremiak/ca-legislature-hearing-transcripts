I'M WE'RE HERE WITH RESPECT TO THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE WERE ASKING FOR ONE POINT SIX MILLION. NINE HUNDRED ONE FOUR SIX I'M. A SUCKER TO A I'M SORRY -- I'VE SIGNED WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE BUT COMMUNITIES YOURSELF FOR SURE I'M THE FOCUS WHAT I AM LAWYER VINE OFFICE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL I HAVE WITH ME JULIE JOHNSON WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT.

SO THE UNIT WAS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR -- WITH THE BUDGET APART ITEM APPROPRIATION TO GET US UP AND RUNNING IN THIS YEAR WERE ASKING -- FOR ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ON GOING ON OPERATIONS OF THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT THAT INCLUDES OUR STAFFING WITH.

IN HARASSMENT RELATED MATTERS. THANK YOU FINANCE. NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SOMEONE. THANK YOU -- I REQUEST FOR DIRECTOR JOHNSON JUST ASSUME THE ROLE OF RUNNING THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT. THIS BUDGET REQUEST REFLECTS ASSUMPTIONS. ABOUT THE WORTH OF THE UNIT THAT WERE SET BEFORE YOU SEEM TO ROLE. DO THAT LEVEL OF REFERRALS INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE SEEN SO FAR -- LINE OF THE EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU WERE SET. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS CRAFTED. I THINK THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THEY THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROJECTED WHICH IS WHY WE ARE. LOOKING TO POTENTIALLY HIRE SOMEONE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- BUT OTHERWISE I THINK WITH THAT ADDITIONAL POSITION THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN LINE WITH. THE EXPECTATIONS. GIVE US A SENSE OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK WHICH IS SEEN TO THIS DAY. SURE. WE HAVE ABOUT. TO DATE WE HAVE. SIXTY THREE COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED. AND WE'VE BEEN OPEN SINCE FEBRUARY ONE SO IT THAT THAT AVERAGE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ONE PER DAY. DO YOU EXPECT THAT LEVEL OF WORK TO GROW OR SHRINK IN THE COMING MONTHS -- I I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL PROBABLY GO DOWN SLIGHTY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEW AND PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE COMPLAINTS. IN ADDITION A WE'VE BEEN TRAINING AS YOU'RE AWARE THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN WE'VE BEEN TRAINING. OF THE MEMBERS AND THE EMPLOYEES SO THAT I THINK. MANY PEOPLE HAVE -- COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THAT THE TRAINING THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THE COMMENTS. OKAY THIS PLAN WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENTS. OKAY WE MAKE SURE THIS WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT HAS RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO CONDUCT ITS WORK IN A TIMELY AND THOROUGH MANNER -- PLEASE RETURN TO US EXCUSE ME PLEASE RETURN TO US THE RESOURCE PROVIDER NOT SUFFICIENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS WILL THIS NUMBER TO THE PART OF INDUSTRIALIZATION. DOMESTIC WORKER RIGHTS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH GOVERNOR. WE GET TO START WONDERFUL YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS LINDSAY EMI HONG I AM THE CALIFORNIA. DIRECTOR FOR HAND IN HAND THE DOMESTIC EMPLOYERS NETWORK WE ARE A NATIONAL NETWORK OF EMPLOYERS OF NANNIES HOUSE CLEANERS AND HOME CARE WORKERS. THAT USE ORGANIZING EDUCATION. TO ADVANCE DIGNIFY WORKING CONDITIONS THAT BENEFIT WORKER AN EMPLOYER LIKE. I'M ALSO A MOTHER AND I HIRED A NANNY FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS. JESSICA HELPED ME RAISE MY SONS SHE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT PARENTING. SHE HELPED TAKE CARE OF THEM ALMOST FIVE DAYS A WEEK. ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE MY CAREER I WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HER. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET ASK OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE THE DOMESTIC WORKER RIGHTS EDUCATION OUTREACH PROGRAM. WITHIN THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. THIS PROGRAM WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOMESTIC WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THE OVER TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT RELY ON THEIR LABOR AND SERVICES. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO GROW GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF SENIORS NEEDING IN HOME CARE. DOMESTIC EMPLOYERS ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER KIND OF EMPLOYER. ANYONE CAN BECOME A DOMESTIC EMPLOYER TOMORROW A CALIFORNIAN COULD REALIZE THE NEED TO HIRE A NANNY HOUSE CLEANER OR HOME CARE ATTENDANT. AND COULD DO SO WITHOUT HAVING ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES. MANY OF US DO NOT THINK OF OURSELVES AS EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THE WORK HAPPENS IN THE INTIMACY OF OUR HOMES. AND MANY OF US BECOMING PLAYERS IN THE MIDST OF A MAJOR LIFE CHANGE AND SOMETIMES AN EMERGENCY LIKE WHEN AN AGING PARENT FALLS. AND SUDDENLY NEEDS HELP WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AT HAND IN HAND I MEET. NEW PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE TO FIND QUALITY CHILD CARE FOR THEIR BABIES. AS WELL AS HOUSE CLEANER IN HOME CARE EMPLOYERS. WHO ARE HOPING TO ESTABLISH MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE THEY EMPLOY? GET THE OFTEN SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO START. FOR THIS REASON I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE DOMESTIC WORKER RIGHTS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM. IT WOULD PROVIDE NECESSARY TRAINING TO BOTH DOMESTIC WORKERS AND DOMESTIC EMPLOYERS ON IMPORTANT LABOR PROTECTIONS SUCH AS MINIMUM WAGE. SICK LEAVE RECORDKEEPING AND RETALIATION. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OVERTIME PAY WHICH WAS A RIGHT THAT WAS RECENTLY. MADE PERMANENT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC WORKER. BILL OF RIGHTS. IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH A. B.. TWO FOUR ONE IT IS CONCERNING THAT IN A STATEWIDE STUDY CONDUCTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE UCLA LABOR CENTER FOUND THAT ONLY ABOUT ONE IN EVERY FOUR DOMESTIC EMPLOYERS KNEW ABOUT THIS NEW LAW. FOR BECOMING EMPLOYERS EVERY DAY WITHOUT ANY UNDERSTANDING OF IT. SO LET'S FIND THE DOMESTIC WORKER RIGHTS EDUCATION OUTREACH PROGRAM TO CHANGE THAT. I NOW WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TERRY VS IN YOUR OF THE FILIPINO WORKER CENTER THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TERRY VS IN YOUR AND I'M A WORKER LE LATER FROM THE BILL BEEN WORK A CENTURY. I WORK AS A FULL TIME CARE GIVER FOR SENIOR CLIENT AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR FAMILY HOME. I WORKING SHIFT BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND SUPPORT MY CLIENTS IN ALL OF HIS. ACTIVITIES DAILY NEEDS I PREPARE MY CLIENTS IN WIFE MEALS. AND I BRING MY CLIENTS THESE DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS. AND I SEE HIM TAKING HIS MEDICATION I ALSO ASSIST HIM WITH ALL THESE ART PROJECT AND HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES. HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTER AND SON ALSO I NEED TO RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS AS WELL I'M MORE THAN A CARE GIVER. I'M ALSO FOUND YET TENDON AS SECRETARY AND A COOK. MY WORK IS IMPORTANT. AND VALUABLE TO THE FAMILY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO ENSURE THAT MY JOB AS A DOMESTIC WORKER. A PROFESSION THAT IS HELD BY A MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANT WOMEN RECEIVE THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT IT DESERVES. BEFORE I JOINED A PPO ACRE CENTER I WORKED FOR FIVE YEARS. AS THE CARE GIVER I WAS NOT AWARE THAT DOMESTIC WORKERS. HAD ANY LABOR PROTECTION AT ALL BECAUSE OUR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INFORMAL AND INTIMATE. WORKPLACE OF SOMEONE'S PRIVATE HOME. I WORK FOR FAMILIES TO LIVE IN CARE GIVER FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY I RECEIVED OVER TIME NO OVERTIME PAY. NO PAID TIME OFF AND SICKLY OF I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. WITH THAT PICTURE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I HAD LABOR RIGHTS AND PROTECTION I FELT TRAPPED I WAS ALONE IN MY EMPLOYERS HOME. AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND RESOURCES OF WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO NAVIGATE MY SITUATION. I ESPECIALLY THOUGHT I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY SITUATION BECAUSE I WITH AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AT THAT TIME I FEARED BEING DEPORTED. AND I FEARED LOSING MY ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY FAMILY. JUST LIKE ME THE MAJORITY OF DOMESTIC WORKER WHETHER DAY YOU ARE A HOUSE CLEANER NANNIES OR HOME CARE. WORKER ATTENDANT DO NOT KNOW OUR RIGHTS OR WHAT WE CAN DO IF OUR RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. AND AS MEANS A FAD. OUR EMPLOYERS DO NOT KNOW THE LAWS OR DO REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE LABOR LAWS EVEN MINIMUM WAGE ACTUALLY. APPLY INSIDE THEIR HOMES. I'M EITHER GETTING FOR THE DOMESTIC WORKERS RIGHT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM SO THAT OUR RIGHTS ARE UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS. AND SO THAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE ACTUALLY FUNCTION TO PROTECT US IN OUR DAILY. LIVES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] WE ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR COOPER ANOTHER MEMBERS MY NAME IS VICTORIA HAAS SEED I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS -- SUBJECT TO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET LANGUAGE WE ARE PREPARING A STUDY TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DOMESTIC WORKER INDUSTRY. THAT WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ACTIONS TAKE FORWARD AS WELL AS AN OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY AS IT STANDS TODAY. ALL PROVIDE SOME OF A PRELIMINARY REPORT -- FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY THAT -- IN THE FULL REPORT WILL BE LATER THIS SUMMER. SO FOR AN OVERVIEW. THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER IS EXPECTED TO NEARLY DOUBLE AND REACH ALMOST NINE MILLION BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CARE GIVERS. WHAT CHILD CARE WORKER EMPLOYMENT IS GROWING SLOWLY AND THE NUMBER OF HOME HEALTH AIDES HAS RECENTLY SHRUNK? THE RANKS OF PERSONAL KERRY'S IN CALIFORNIA HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO RISE BY ALMOST 35% A YEAR. THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THERE ARE ABOUT -- FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FORMAL DIRECT CARE GIVERS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR HOME HEALTH AIDES. AS WE LOOK TO THE DATA THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE CONDUCTED A STATEWIDE REVIEW OF ALL CLAIMS RECEIVE IN. 201-620-1720 EIGHTEEN AND CLAIMS THROUGH MID FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY. THAT WERE ATTRIBUTED TO DOMESTIC WORKERS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY PERSONAL ATTENDANTS WERE DOCUMENTED AS A TYPE OF WORK MEETING THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL ATTENDANT PER THE LABOR CODE. BEFORE GETTING INTO THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM THAT REVIEW. I DO URGE CAUTION WHEN LOOKING AT THE DATA IS THERE ARE SEVERAL -- SEVERAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER. IN TERMS OF BARRIERS -- TO UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDERSTANDING THE INDUSTRY BETTER AND ALSO BARRIERS TO GREATER ENFORCEMENT. AND THE CLOUD RECOMMENDATIONS. THEIR LOGISTICAL AND JURISDICTIONAL BARRIERS FOR ENFORCEMENT ONE IS EMPLOYER CLIENTS HOME IS THE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WHICH THE NONTRADITIONAL WORKPLACE. OUR FIELD ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TYPICALLY WOULD NOT ENTER CLIENTS HOME FOR AN INVESTIGATION BUT WOULD INSTEAD SET UP WHAT'S KNOWN AS IN ORDER TO APPEAR. MOST OF THE CLAIMS RECEIVED OR THROUGH OUR WAGE CLAIM PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES THE WORKER THEMSELVES TO COME FORWARD. THERE COULD BE FEAR OF THE LOSS OF JOB IN OR BENEFITS SUCH AS RUMOR BOARD IF COMING FORWARD. THERE'S ALSO SOME LEGAL COMPLEXITY GIVEN THE CHANGING STATE THE LAW WHICH I WILL TOUCH ON IN A MOMENT. STATE FEDERAL CASE LAW IMPACT THIS GROUP OF WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS AND DOES NEED TO BE CLARIFIED. SINCE PASSAGE OF THE DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS OVER TIME HERE IT'S OF CALIFORNIA'S PERSONAL ATTENDANTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY. ONE A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE MINEOLA VERSUS CPS SECURITY SOLUTIONS. WHICH CONCERNED COMPATIBILITY OF ON CALL AND SLEEP TIME. THE FEDERAL HOME CARE FINAL RULE SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS OTHER LABOR LAWS THAT HAVE IMPACTED THIS POPULATION AND AFFECTED THIS INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF INCREASING LOCAL AND STATE MINIMUM WAGE. WITH THAT BEING SAID. THESE WERE THE FINDINGS FROM THAT CLAIM REVIEW FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO MID FEBRUARY. TWENTY NINETEEN OVER 90% OF CLAIMANTS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE CARE GIVERS INCLUDING DOMESTIC WORKERS PERSONAL DIRECT CARE HOME CARE AT CETERA. AND AMONG THESE 2% SPECIFIED ELDER CARE. IN AN EQUAL PERCENTAGE 2% INDICATE THAT THEY PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR OR LIVE IN CARE. NANNIES CHILD CARE PROVIDERS COMPRISE 6%. ONLY 3% DESCRIBED THEIR TYPE OF WORK SPECIFICALLY AS PERSONAL ATTENDANTS. BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS AN OVERALL STEADY INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF WAGE CLAIMS FILED WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. IN TOTAL ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED CLAIMS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD WITH A HIGHER CONCENTRATION IN THE GREATER EL áREA AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA CORRESPONDING WITH LARGER POPULATION CENTERS IN THE STATE. WE DO CAUTION AGAIN THAT THE LIMITED NUMBER SUGGEST THAT FINDINGS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY. GENERAL BE ABLE TO BE GENERALIZED TO ALL DOMESTIC WORKERS. WORKERS REPORT AN AVERAGE WAGE OF THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY FOUR CENTS AN HOUR AND THE MEDIAN WAS ELEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR. NEARLY A QUARTER OF CLAIMANTS REPORTED THEIR WAGES RECEIVED AN HOURLY WAGE BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN DOLLARS. AND ONE IN FIVE CLAIMANTS WERE PAID LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. IN THE YEARS EXAMINED ALTHOUGH MORE THAN FOREIGN FIVE WORKERS REPORTED HOURLY WAGES AT THE MINIMUM WAGE. ONE IN TEN OR MORE. REPORTED THAT THEY RECEIVED LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. OVER A THIRD OF THE CASES FILED WITH US -- WERE SETTLED. ONE IN FIVE WERE EITHER ABANDONED BY THE CLAIMANT AND 16% FAILED TO APPEAR APPEAR FOR THEIR CASE. THE SIX ZERO EXCUSE ME ONE SIX SIX NINETEEN THANK YOU POLICIES. IN TERMS OF RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN ADDITIONAL SURVEY TO OBTAIN A TAPE OBTAINED IT STAKEHOLDER INPUT. ON OUR REGION EDUCATION RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CENTURY BOTH TO AFFECTED WORKERS AND POSSIBLE EMPLOYERS. MEMBERS OF THE SURVEY INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE INITIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED BY THIS LEGISLATURE ATTHAT INCLUDES LABOR MANAGEMENT. WORKER ADVOCACY GROUPS AS WELL AS ACADEMIC GROUPS THAT RE FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF THIS INDUSTRY. AND FURTHER DETAILS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT PROVIDED TO LATER THIS SUMMER. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE OKAY. WHAT A SPECIFIC CHALLENGES IN EDUCATING THE FORCING LABOR LAWS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL. I THINK ONE IS FOR LOW WAGE POPULATIONS. THERE IS A GENERALFEAR IN COMING FORWARD TO A GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT SOMETHING THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND NOW THE LABOR SECRETARY HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO OVERCOME. WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. EMPLOYEE GROUPS AND AN EMPLOYER GROUPS AS WELL TO HELP YOU OUT REACH THOSE POPULATIONS -- GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE WORKER POPULATION SPECIFICALLY -- WE NEED TO EMPLOY MULTIPLE STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO REACH THEM EFFECTIVELY -- AND HAVE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MATERIALS THAT ARE. EASILY TRANSLATABLE AND CAN. CONVEY SOME OF THE COMPLEX LEGAL ISSUES AND THE RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOTH THE WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS AND AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND MANNER SO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COMPLY. EARLY ON BUT EVEN WITH ALL THAT STILL KIND OF A TOUGH TOUGH NUT TO CRACK. IT CAN BE CHALLENGING AREA. WE ALSO WENT WHEN A QUESTION THIS ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT PROVIDING RESOURCES TO PROVIDE OUT REGION EDUCATION THE DOMESTIC WORKER INDUSTRY. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT AND IMPROVE COMPLIANCE SO THAT WORKERS ARE TREATED APPROPRIATELY HAVE TO CONFER WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCING ADMINISTRATION ON SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY.

ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS IN REVISING THE LEAD STANDARDS WE AGREE THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL STANDARDS AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE DETAILS OFF THE PROCESS. THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH TO UPDATE OUR OF LEAD STANDARDS -- THE OF WORK STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN PROMPTED BY -- A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SINCE THEN WE'VE HELD SIX ADVISORY MEETINGS WITH BOB TO GET STAKEHOLDER INPUT -- INCLUDING INDUSTRY BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES STATE AGENCIES AND WORKERS BOB FROM THERE WE'VE COME UP WITH SIX DIFFERENT VERSIONS OFF THE REVISED LEAD STANDARDS. SIX SIX DIFFERENT CROPS -- THE THE DROPS REQUIRED -- SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AN ANALYSIS. OF THE MEDICAL AND OTHER INFORMATION. SUPPLIED BY HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE EXPERTS HAD TO BE REVIEWED AND ASSESSED FROM A NECK OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PERSPECTIVE. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NOT JUST THE PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVEL BUT OTHER. BOB STANDARDS THAT NEED TO WORK IN TANDEM WITH THAT. P. L. -- IN ORDER FOR THE STANDARDS TO BE EFFECTIVE AS A WHOLE -- WE HAVE A DRAFT A FINAL DRAFT -- THAT WAS. BOB FINALIZED IN NOVEMBER -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT FINAL DRAFT STANDARDS.

CAN -- BEGIN ONCE FORMAL RULE MAKING -- BEGINS WHEN THE STANDARD STANDARDS BOARD IS READY TO THE ISSUE THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING THEN IT COULD TAKE UP TO ONE YEAR FOR RULE MAKING -- SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMPLETION DATE -- FOR THE ENTIRE REVISED LEAD STANDARDS -- FOR GENERAL INDUSTRY AND FOR CONSTRUCTION OUT WOULD. WOULD BE MADE. TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS AGAIN THE REVISED THAT THE REVISED. LED STANDARD INCLUDING THE PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVEL AND THE OTHER -- STANDARDS THAT NEED TO WORK IN TANDEM FOR THE FOR THE P. L. TO BE EFFECTIVE AND FOR PROTECT WORKER PROTECTIONS. TO BE EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING INCLUDING THE ACTUAL LEVEL -- WHICH IS THE TRIGGER FOR EMPLOYERS TO TO ACT -- IN THE TO PROTECT THEIR WORKERS AND THE ALL OF THE OTHER STANDARDS THAT GO WITH WITH THAT PACKAGE. TOTAL SIX MEETINGS OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. PARDON WE'LL SIX MEETINGS OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THEY WERE -- IN FACT THEY TOOK PLACE FROM -- 200-011-22000 SIXTEEN SO IN EFFECT IT WAS THOSE FIVE TO SIX YEARS -- THEN -- WHAT WHAT THE -- ALSO TOOK UP A SUBSTANTIAL TIME IS THE PREPARATION ALL OF OF THE SHARIA -- THAT IS A PROCESS THAT WE MUST UNDERGO FOR ANY REGULATION THAT -- WILL HAVE AN IMPACT OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- AND THAT IS AN EXTENSIVE STUDY -- IN PARTICULAR FOR THE FOR IN IN THIS CASE -- IT WAS A COMPLEX STANDARD SO -- IT IT TOOK AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF TIME SO WE HAVE A HAD A MEETING THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE LAST MEETING WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CORRECT. THE LAST MEETING I BELIEVE WAS -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEN THE DRAFT THE FINAL DRAFT REGULATION WAS PREPARED -- AND THE OF THE MYSTERY A WAS WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE FINAL DRAFT REGULATION IN THE TIME. AND THAT. FOR THOSE THREE YEAH YES -- THE SHARIA TOOK A SUBSTANCE EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF OF TIME AND WORK TO TO GET COMPLETED BUT IN THIS IN THESE THREE YEARS -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO BEING OUT IN COUNCIL OF HAS CONSULTED DEAL LAUGH -- INFORMALLY ON THE CONTENTS OF THIS RIA AND HAS -- HAS GONE BACK TO RESOLVE THOSE ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR FOR INFORMATION MR HAIR. BUT SHERMAN WAS IN HERE. OF ALSO MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE AS WELL -- TO YOU I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU TOO MUCH OF THE HISTORY THE LABORS ORGANIZATION NATIONWIDE IS HAVING A A HUGE MARKET SHARE IN THE REMEDIATION INDUSTRY. OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT PERMITS CONTROL BY 90% IF NOT BETTER WHEN IT COMES REMEDIATION NOW IN THE LEAD ABATEMENT ALSO THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIALS OF ALL OF ALL TYPES OF THAT ARE. BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AS IS WHICH IS IN THE STATE. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- THERE'S A PROCESS AND IS A DUE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE TAKING PLACE. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED IN ALWAYS AS ORGANIZATION BUT MANY OTHERS ALSO TRAIN AND RECERTIFY THESE WORKERS THE BY THE WAY IS A VERY FILTHY WORK. TO TO PERFORM -- THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPOSED THERE'S LIMITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS IS OR YOUR STATED LIMITS I HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SO MANY YEARS THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPOSE THE SAME WORKERS. AND NEW WORKERS TO COME INTO THE INDUSTRY AND WE'RE JUST MAKING THE CLAIM THAT AT ALL POSSIBLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO LOWER THESE LIMITS. GO TO THE PROCESS EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AT ALL POSSIBLE -- IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OF HAVING THESE DISASTERS FIRES WHERE THIS TYPE OF WORK ACTIVITY HAS BEEN. KEY TO THE TO THE CLEAN UP OPERATIONS OF OUR FIRES BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- YOU FIND A LOT OF LEAD ABATEMENT WITHIN A VERY IS -- OLD BUILDINGS. THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE IN OUR COMPANIES ARE CONTRACTORS% ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE EXPOSURE LIMITS BUT TO THE DEGREE THAT. UNTIL THEIR REDUCE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPOSE UNNECESSARY AMOUNT OF PEOPLE DUE TO THE LIMITS NOT BEING. UPDATED. AGAIN I I CERTAINLY RESPECT WITH THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO. BUT I'D REALLY WOULD INSIST THAT WHATEVER WE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS WOULD BE EXTREMELY. VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE ON BEHALF OF ALL THESE WORDS IN THE STATE. SO IT WAS DISCUSSED TALKING ABOUT IS A DATE OF A NURSING A NEW DATE OF FEBRUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S TEN MONTHS AWAY. IS THAT REALISTIC. WE BELIEVE THAT -- FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE STANDARD -- A DATA MAY TWENTY TWENTY WOULD BE REALISTIC AND WHEN I SAY COMPREHENSIVE STEP THAT STANDARD I I MEAN NOT JUST THE THE P. L. THE PERMISSIBLE PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVEL. BUT THE ENTIRE STANDARD INCLUDING THE ACTUAL LEVEL -- WHICH IS THE SET THE THE STANDARD THAT TRIGGERS THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES. BOB BEFORE HARM OCCURS BECAUSE THE P. L. WORKS -- TO TO SET THE LINE FROM WHERE HARM WOULD OCCUR -- BUT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS THE ONE THAT TRIGGERS THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND THE STANDARD THAT THE DIVISION IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND AND WE HOPE -- TO TO TO SENT TO THE BOARD -- IN A IN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. HOW IS COMPREHENSIVE SO INC IT WOULD INCLUDE THE P. L. BUT IT ALSO WOULD INCLUDE THE ACTION LEVEL? AND OTHER STANDARDS AS WELL THAT MAKE THAT PROTECTION -- REAL. I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT IF IF IS THAT REASONABLE IS THAT REALISTIC IT'S BEEN AT THIS A LONG TIME COMING. AND I'M NOT A SCIENTIST BUT STILL WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF THE ORDINARY Là FOLKS HAVE DEALT WITH THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE SO. AND THIS ISN'T CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE. IS BEING DONE ELSEWHERE SO. THIS IS A CONCERNS BEEN SO LONG. IT WILL REALLY HAPPEN IN TWENTY AT SOME POINT SO MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND TO ME LAST ME OCCURRED THREE YEARS AGO AND TO GET A REPORT IT TAKES THREE YEARS AGO REPORT -- AFTER CALL B. S. ON THAT -- I JUST I JUST NOT SURE WHERE IT GOT DROPPED AT THESE WORKERS ARE BEING EXPOSED LEVEL IT'S IT'S REAL. IT'S DANGEROUS -- IS IT IT'S IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE CAN'T GET IT DONE SOONER AND QUICKER STILL SOMEWHERE. IN MY OPINION AND LET'S GET MONTH SCIENTISTS -- BEEN DRAGGING OUR THE BALLS BEEN DROPPED SO -- THE QUESTION COMMITTEE WHICH LACKEY NO SIR. A THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS YEAR I I JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE -- BUT I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY RELEVANT. IS LONG AS THESE LEVELS ARE NOT ADJUSTED. THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO IN MANY CASES. CONSIDER THIS TO BE. BECAUSE THEY COULD GO AHEAD AND WORK UNDERNEATH THESE LEVELS THAT HAVE BEEN. AT THIS OVER SO HIGH FOR SO LONG. THE CONTINUE TO PERFORM THIS ABATEMENT. UP UNTIL THAT POINT TO GET THAT. THAT IS SO HIGH THAT THEY CAN BID ON IT FOR THE LACK OF THE IMPROPER LICENSE. IN OTHER WORDS FOR DEMOLITION TYPE WORK. THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH DO A LOT OF DEMOLITION WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO DO THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES. BECAUSE OF THE LEVELS IF THESE LEVELS DON'T COME DOWN THEY WERE EXPOSING KNOWING THE WORKERS WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION AT LARGE. NOW ANY EMPLOYERS REFORM HIS TYPE OF WORK SORRY UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE GENERAL POPULATION IN FACT IS BE PERFORMED. WELL PEOPLE AROUND. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR REALLY CONSIDER AND THAT'S THE REASON I THINK THEY WERE SO. I THINK THAT THE PART WHATEVER EVERYTHING POSSIBLY DUE TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY APPRECIATED ONCE AGAIN. AND WHEN WERE THE LEVELS ESTABLISHED HOW LONG AGO. IN THE NINETIES. IT'S BEEN A WHILE [inaudible] S.. WE'RE GOING OVER THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YEAH FOR THE AYE ARE UNRELATED. QUESTION -- CAN BRIGHTEN UP THE ON THE WAIT LIST FOR THE GARMENT RESTITUTION FUND.

THESE FACTORIES AND THE MAJORITY OF GARMENT FACTORIES PAID BY THE PIECE. AND THE PAY THAT YOU GET IS DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PIECES YOU MAKE. IN OVER LOCK HE EXPLAINS. YOU HAVE TO WORK SIXTY HOURS TO MAKE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO SURVIVE IN LOS ANGELES. IN THE FACTORY THERE'S NO WATER OR DRINK AND A LOT OF DUST. THEY DON'T GIVE US MASKS OR GLOVES AND WE NEED TO PREVENT THAT WE NEED TO PREVENT US FROM BREATHING IN THE DA'S. WE BREATHE IN THE DUST AND IT'S BAD FOR OUR LONG. AFTER TEN YEARS HE WAS FIRED UNJUSTLY. AND THIS IS BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO STAY AT WORK BETWEEN SIX AM AND SEVEN PM WITHOUT BEING PAID WAGES FOR THOSE TIME PERIODS.

THE CASE LOAD -- BORN OF BY THOSE -- WORKERS WHO PROCESS THESE CLAIMS EVALUATE THE CLAIMS REVIEW THE CLAIMS MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT. THE STATE IN THESE CASES HOW THE CASE LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND PER CASE WORKER -- THE THE REASON THAT THAT MATTERS. IS BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THEIR CASE WORK -- OF THAT THE ATTORNEYS ARE ABLE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE JUDGE. OUR WHO IS PRESIDING OVER THE CASE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL IN CASES WHERE -- 1100% DISABILITY IS ALLEGED. AND SO -- BECAUSE THEY CANNOT MANAGE THE WORKLOAD -- THAT THEY HAVE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IN THOSE 1100% DISABILITY CASE -- CASES WHEN THEY COME FORWARD -- THERE THE STATE LACKS THE% EVIDENCE TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE THE CLAIM AND SOUL. THE JUDGES LAUGHED WITH THIS RULING AND I QUOTE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFORMATION TO THE CONTRARY I MUST AWARD -- FOR THE CLAIM IT. TO THE TUNE OF A 100% DISABILITY.

MARK MINUTES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YES WE DO -- THE PROGRAM -- CURRENTLY HAS OVER TEN THOUSAND OPEN CASES -- INCREASING BY ABOUT 26% ANNUALLY ESSENTIALLY THIS IS -- THIS -- JUST THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL RIGHT SIZE IT DEPARTMENT BACK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE TO HANDLE OF ALL OF THOSE CASES TO ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DOWN -- TO DOWN FROM ONE THOUSAND CASES PER STAFF MEMBER DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY WHICH IS A LOT MORE MANAGEABLE AND OUT WILL ALLOW THE DIR -- TO IT HANDLED THE CASE IS BETTER OKAY. ANYONE THE PUBLIC WHICH MAY COME OF THIS ITEM. OKAY WERE HOMELESS ISSUE OPEN TO FURTHER CONSIDER THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WITH ALTERNATIVES FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. THIS WILL ON THE ITEM NUMBER SIX PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP -- IN -- TAKING A LOOK AT THE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCREASING -- THE BENEFIT DURATION FROM SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS -- FOR BOTH FUNDING CARE AS WELL AS WILL BECOME EXIGENCY -- IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY -- TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT -- AS WELL AS LOWERING -- THE THE ANNUAL DISBURSEMENTS TO COVER -- AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS EXCUSE ME -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IS RIGHT SIZED FINANCE -- NO FURTHER COMMENTS. L. L.. THANK YOU YES ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES THE CHANGES THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS IS PROPOSING WAS ONLY RELEASED -- JUST SEVERAL DAYS AGO SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE THAT THE POLICY ITSELF OR THE THE FISCAL ESTIMATES THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED ASSOCIATED WITH THAT POLICY -- WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT SPEAK WITH APARTMENT ADDITIONALLY AND US WOULD CONSIDER THIS ISSUE. FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION. CHEMICAL AND OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. IF UNANIMOUS NOTS KNOWN TO HAVE THE CHILDREN NOW IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE LOOK FORWARD. TO GETTING MORE DETAILS AND SUPPORTING POLICIES THAT ARE PROVIDE A WIN WIN FOR FAMILIES AND BABIES AND AND PARENTS FOR BONDING AND WITHOUT SACRIFICING THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STARTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- SUPPORT IN THAT WE VERY MUCH AGREE THAT THE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPANDED THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE SIX WEEKS IS ENOUGH TO ADEQUATELY BOND WITH CHILDREN OR OFTEN TO CARE FOR LOVED ONES BUT WE ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE WAY THAT IT'S FUNDED -- THE WAY THAT IT CURRENTLY IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED BY WEAKENING THE SOLVENCY OF THE ENTIRE DE I FUND. AND THAT THOSE SOLVENCY STANDARDS WERE CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AFTER THE PROGRAM WAS ESSENTIALLY IN THE RED FOR TWO YEARS. AND THEN -- IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AFTER ANOTHER PERIOD WHERE STATUTE -- WITHDREW THAT STANDARD ALSO WENT BANKRUPT AGAIN AND GIVEN THAT THE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND PAYS FOR ESSENTIALLY WORKERS -- TO TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES WHEN THEY'RE INJURED SO SEVERELY THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN NO LONGER WORK IN A SUPPORT THEMSELVES. WERE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF THAT FUN TO CONTINUE AND WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE THAT OTHER FUNDING MECHANISMS WHETHER IT'S AN EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION OR SOME OTHER METHOD BE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE AYE FUND. THANK YOU. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- WILL BE THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TASK FORCE ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I I EXPECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE INVOLVED -- IT'S THE TASK FORCE ITSELF IS COMING TOGETHER AS WE SPEAK I KNOW THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH DIFFERENT LEGISLATORS AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. ON THE ISSUE. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO USE A PORTION OF THE RESERVE WITHIN THE DISABILITY INSURANCE. FUND THE DOWN PAYMENT ON THE EXPANDING FIT ON EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WILL BE THE IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE FUND. CONSIDERING IN THE RED WHAT TWICE WE JUST HEARD -- SO -- SO THE TO MAINTAIN A RESERVE OF WOULD BE AMENDED TO MAINTAIN A RESERVE OF ABOUT 25235% OF ANNUAL DISBURSEMENT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO THE 45250% -- RESERVE CURRENTLY TO DELIVER THE EXPANDED BENEFITS WITH MINIMAL IMPACTS -- TO BY WITH MIDDLE MINIMAL IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS -- DID ADMINISTRATION IS CONFIDENT THIS TO BUFFER -- WILL -- THIS NEW BUFFER AMOUNT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB FLUCTUATIONS AND REVENUES TO TRIP FUTURE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS IN CHANGING DEMAND FOR SERVICES. WHAT IS THE MINISTRATION PROPOSE INCREASING THE DURATION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE INSTEAD OF? THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE SURE -- SO PUBLIC HEALTH AND I'M ECONOMIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROVIDING I SIX MONTHS OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE THE NORM IS NOT IN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES -- THESE TO POSITIVE HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN GREATER OP. GREATER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS AND LESS STRAIN ON FINDING AND AFFORDING INFANT CHILD CARE. SO THEY BRING ARE THEY BRING PREMATURE AND SHOULDN'T A LOT OF TASK FORCE TO CONSIDER HOW TO BEST EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. COMPREHENSIVELY -- WELL -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A GREAT NEED AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A PRETTY NEXT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE NEED SO WHAT'S THE USE THE TASK FORCE AND WORLD THAT THE TASK FORCE WILL BE -- WORKING TO CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDING ALIGNING WORKER PROTECTIONS ON TO THAT -- TO FAMILIES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. AMONG MANY OTHER. POLICY OPTIONS OKAY THANK YOU FEEL EVEN THE SENSUAL AND SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. I SUPPORTERS PROGRAM LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE ON EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS VERY NARAL SOLUTION. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR SHOULD LOOK HOLISTICALLY AT THIS PROGRAM. CONSIDERING THE EXPANSION. WILL THIS ITEM OPEN LIKE FORTY MINISTRATION WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ANY PROPOSED EXPANSION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT OTHER NUMBER SEVEN CALIFORNIA WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT BOARD. REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT ACT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. TIM RAINY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- THE AB ELEVEN ELEVEN THE REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT IS A UNIQUE GRANT PROGRAM FOR SERVING DISADVANTAGED WORKERS. WITH SICK SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THE GAP THAT'S OUT THERE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN MY MANY YEARS OF DOING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- THERE A COUPLE THEIR MANY BUT ALL OF POINT OUT A COUPLE RELEVANT TO THIS THIS BILL. AT THE FIRST IS RESOURCES FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES -- THINGS LIKE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE STIPENDS. THE CHILD CARE RESOURCES -- VARIOUS GOT MENTORING -- THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS TEND NOT TO FIND ENOUGH -- BUT THEY'RE NECESSARY TO GET PEOPLE UP TO A POINT. WHERE THEY'RE GONNA SUCCEED IN HIGHER LEVEL -- TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS -- THE SECOND IS COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE. DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONNECT TO THE BROADER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM UP THERE SMALL MISSION DRIVEN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SMALLER ONES NOT THE BIG -- WONDERFUL ONES LIKE GOOD WILL -- AND URBAN LEAGUE WHICH DO GREAT WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONES ARE REALLY TRYING TO GET INVOLVED IN THE WORK FOR SYSTEM. THAT HAVE THE BEST CONNECTIONS TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TRYING TO IMPACT -- THEY ARE AS A SAID THE CBO'S HAVE A HARD TIME OF OF ENGAGING WITH COMMITTEE WORTH I'M SORRY WITH WORK FOR SOME OF WAS LOCALLY COMMITTEE COLLEGES TO GET THE DOLLARS. THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE COMMITTEE -- THEIR BEST AT SO ELEVEN ELEVEN REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AT LEAST ONE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND ONE COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATION -- IN IN THE RFA WE JUST DEVELOPED AND IT'S GOING TO THE CLEARANCE PROCESS WERE IDENTIFYING CBO'S THAT OR THOSE -- SMALLER ONES THAT ARE REALLY COMMUNITY BASED THEIR DEEP IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO KNOW BEST HOW TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT FOR THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO IMPACT -- SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY -- WHAT THE ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OF THE CBO'S IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- BOARDS I IN THE APPLICATIONS THEIR SUCCESSFUL ARE ALSO GOING TO REFLECT THAT IN THEIR BUDGETS -- BECAUSE THE BIG PROBLEM IS IT ONCE -- PROPOSER DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIPS ARE MADE AND THEY COME UP TO THE STATE SOMEHOW MAGICALLY THE THE DOLLARS TEND NOT TO GET TO THE COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS. SO WERE WERE WORKING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES GO -- TO THE PARTNERS UP FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE IN THERE INTENDING TO DO THEY PROPOSED TO DO -- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD UNDERSTAND SAID JUST AS POPULATIONS WITH ME A LOT OF SUPPORT WRAPAROUND SERVICES CBO'S WHO ARE GETTING INTO THIS WORK IN THE WAYS THAT WE'RE HOPING. ALSO NEED THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. SO OUR MODEL OF GRANT MAKING IS TO PROVIDE GENEROUS HANDS ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMITTEE BASS ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS -- THIS IS NOT ADMIN WORK THIS IS PROGRAM WORK -- I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T. EXPECT THAT A MARRIAGE STAFF AT THE STATE LEVEL GOING TO BE DOING PROGRAM WORK THERE'S ALWAYS HIS PERCEPTION THAT IS ALL ADMIN AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE ARE PROPOSING -- IN THE IN OUR BUDGETS A CHANGE PROPOSAL TO RE DIRECT THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED. FOR A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN TO SUPPORT THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARDS WORK. IN SUPPORTING COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATION SO THAT THEIR PROGRAMS ARE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY POSSIBLY. CAN BE. WE'RE NOT A BIG ORGANIZATION AS THEY WERE FORCED BOARD WERE RELATIVELY SMALL OUTFIT THIRTY SIX STAFF. OUR FOCUS IS A POLICY IN BUILDING A WORKFORCE SYSTEM. THAT WE USE GRANT FUNDS TO TRY NEW APPROACHES LEARN FROM THE WORK WE DO A LOT OF OF ASSESSMENT REPORTING INFORMATION SHARING AMONG GRANTEES WE HAVE A UNIQUE. INVENTION CALLED THE COMMITTEE PRACTICE WHERE GRANTEES GET TOGETHER ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING IT KIND OF RAISES THE LEVEL. OF PERFORMANCE AND WORK ACROSS GRANTEES SO THERE'S A LOT OF HANDS ON WORK THAT HAPPENS AT THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO MAKE THIS STUFF SUCCESSFUL -- THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible] NO COMMENT [inaudible] L. L.. WE CAN CONVERSATIONS BOTH WITH THE BOARD AND WITH WITH LEAD STAFF ARE IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THE THE THE THE BUDGET. PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL STATE. COSTS -- IS SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN WE WOULD SEE IN A TYPICAL GRANT PROGRAM RUN BY STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER ARMS INDICATED TO US THAT. AS AS MISTER RANEY MENTIONED THAT MUCH OF THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE ARE. LARGELY PROGRAMMATIC IN NATURE NOT NECESSARILY ADMINISTRATIVE AND THE STRUCTURE ON THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN THE JANICE TOLD US THAT AN OPEN WE CONCUR WITH THAT FOR NOW AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION WHEN WHEN TALE THANK YOU. LOCAL PUBLIC COMMENT EMOTIONAL SPEAK. HELEN ROTH DOWDEN IT'S A SAN FRANCISCO JEWISH VOCATIONAL SERVICES WERE IN SUPPORT WE THINK THIS GIVES A WHOLE NEW OPPORTUNITY BRING DIFFERENT GROUPS INTO. THE MIX ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND REALLY REACH INTO THE THE POPULATION THAT'S NEEDED TO BE SERVED THANK YOU. THANK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHETHER IT'S GRANT PROGRAM REQUIRES 22% TO BE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHILE OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS TYPICALLY EXPEND I IN IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FIELD -- THE THE AVERAGE -- FOR ADMINISTRATIVE -- OVERHEAD -- MINISTRY OF COST IS AROUND 8210% -- SO FROM THIS THESE DOLLARS. ABOUT 8210% IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TO THAT PURPOSE TO ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. THE BULK OF THE FUNDS 33% OF THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GO TO PROGRAM WORK PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD STAFF. IN THE FIELD TO SUPPORT THE GRANTEES IN TO ENSURE SUCCESS. HOPE I DON'T THINK YOU LOST ME BUT HE SAID 8210% I'M SORRY THE THE WORK FORCE FIELD IT IT'S IT'S MORE AROUND 8210% FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- FOR FOR HOW TO GET FROM EIGHT TO TEN TO TWENTY TWO AB WERE ONLY GONNA USE 8210% OF THE FUNDS OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD FOR ADMINISTRATIVE WORK -- THAT'S THE THE ACCOUNTING THE FISCAL THE MONITORING THAT TYPE OF THING. THE THE BULK OF THE MONEY TWO THIRDS OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR I'M SORRY TWO THIRDS OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS WERE PROPOSING TO TO MOVE TO THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. THAT'S DEDICATED NOT TO ADMIN SUPPORT BUT TAX WE PROGRAM WORK PROGRAM UP IN THE FIELD OF PROVIDED BY A STATE MARRIAGE STAFF THROUGH THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. OKAY AND ONE OF THE MINISTRATION NOT PROPOSED ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE BOARDS INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- SO WE WERE JUST WE WERE TRYING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH -- FINDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. SO I CONCERNS WITH REDIRECTING A SNIFF CAM PORTION OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION PROVIDED. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE A. B.. YOUR COMMENT OR OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT -- PROVIDE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE AB ONE ALL. ELEVEN ELEVEN GRANT PROGRAM I'M RECOMMENDING THE WHOLE THIS ISSUE OPEN IN ORDER TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BOARD ADMINISTRATION THIS PROPOSAL THROUGH A LITTLE BUTTON.

LET'S NOT ISSUE NUMBER -- EIGHT CAPITA EXPENDITURE PLAN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OKAY TO THE CHASE -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I IS ASKING FOR A SCALING UP OF CURRENT WORK OUT IN THE FIELD -- ONE IS -- CALLED THE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF EACH OF FOURTEEN REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS TO SERVE THREE THOUSAND DISADVANTAGED WORKERS PREPARED FOR STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP.

A COMMON L. L.. M. EARLIER THIS SPRING WE RELEASE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL TO USE G. R. F. FUNDS FOR FOR THESE WORKFORCE PURPOSES AN WE WE THE POINT OF DIFFERENTIATING. THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSALS ARE THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS FOR THE TWO HRC SEE AN H. R. T. P. PROGRAMS IN OUR VIEW. THOSE TWO PROGRAMS WHICH EXIST CURRENTLY STILL AT A SMALLER SCALE ON OUR SERVER READY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE DISTINCTION WE MADE WAS THAT THE THE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSALS FOR THE WORKER TRANSITION. PILOT AS WELL AS FOR THE WORK SURROUNDING THE THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORK. ARE LESS ADVANCED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT -- THE BOARD MENTIONED THAT THAT THEY KNOW IS THAT THESE THESE IDEAS WERE STILL SORT OF COMING TOGETHER SO TO SPEAK -- SO THE RECOMMENDATION WE MADE UP FOR FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE ARCH IS A POTENTIALLY TO CONSIDER. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OVER THESE SORT OF SECONDARY. ARE COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL IT COULD BE IN LEGISLATORS INTEREST TO PROVIDE MAYBE FUNDING ON A ONE OR TWO YEAR BASIS AS OPPOSED TO AN ART OR A FIVE YEAR BASIS. AND POTENTIALLY ESPECIALLY IN THIS FIRST YEAR OR TWO AT A SMALLER LESS AMOUNT -- CURRENTLY THE WORKER TRANSITION PILOT IS IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED AT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS. WE THINK IN THE NEXT YEAR TO AS THAT PILOT IS GETTING STOOD UP IF LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN PURSUING THIS. A SMALLER AMOUNT COULD BE POSSIBLE AND WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPRESS A LITTLE MORE OVERSIGHT OVER AT DEVELOPMENT. OKAY THANK YOU -- WHAT IS THE THE AB THREE NINETY REPORT NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE WAS DUE ON JANUARY FIRST OF? THIS YEAR.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR JOSH WILL GO OKAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD -- THANKS FOR TIME THIS AFTERNOON OF THE STAFF TO THROW RIGHT UP ON OUR BUDGET SITUATION. AS I WILL GO TOO MUCH INTO DETAIL I WILL SAY THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE. OVER THE LAST BUDGET -- SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES HAS READ SALTED AND A DECREASE IN PROCESSING TIME. A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AVERAGE OPEN CASES IN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EARLY SETTLEMENTS ARE PROCESS A DECREASETHE NUMBER OF APPEALS THAT HAD TO OUR BOARD. AND AT THE BOARD LEVEL ITSELF WE THE BOARD HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK OF THE LAST YEAR LOWERING ITS DOCKET FROM WELL OVER EIGHTY CASES. TO ONLY FORTY FIVE AS OF TODAY. IN THIS LAST BUDGET YEAR THEY'VE ALREADY ISSUED SEVENTY SIX DECISIONS COMPARED TO ONLY SIXTY ONE THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GREG CRITICAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT AT THIS TIME WE WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THE THE PREPARATION OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AS REQUESTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ -- GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND FUNDING PURPOSES RECEIVED OVER THE LAST YEAR -- TO ADDRESS PURPOSE BACKLOGS IN CASELOAD WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ALLOW THOSE RESOURCES TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BEFORE WE BEGIN EXPLORING ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY -- IN ADDITION PURPOSE STILL IMPLEMENTING A NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THROUGH ITS CASE PROCESSING INITIATIVE. WHICH WILL PROVIDE FURTHER EFFICIENCY. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THAT THE NUMBER OF CASES FILED IN BEING PROCESSED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY. FLAT OR EVEN WHILE PURPOSE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THEREFORE WE'RE CAN UP CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF APPROPRIATIONS OR AUGMENTATION WHICH REPRESENTS A 17% INCREASE TO PURPOSE OVERALL BUDGET WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE THAT FUNDING WILL BE APPLIED. WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED WITH SUCH A LARGE INCREASE AND A DETAILED PLAN OF HOW THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED FOR THE MORE? WITHOUT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL POSITION AUTHORITY IT'S A IT'S UNCLEAR HOW PER WOULD UTILIZE THAT ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION SO -- AT THIS TIME BASED ON THE ADMISSION BASS REVIEW THAT WE JUST COMPLETED. AND THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS CONDUCTED WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS SUFFICIENT TO HELP HER BELONG IN TERMS OF THEIR CASELOAD AND BACKLOG SITUATION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THEM TO ADDRESS ANY FUTURE NEEDS THAT THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THAT MISSION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD. THANK YOU SEVEN THE JOINED BY SOMEONE WERE RODRIGUEZ WE JUST DISCUSSING YOUR THE FUNDING -- DATA COMMENT ON IT. NOT OR NO WORK YOU'VE BEEN SO FAR BUT FIX.

LIKE TO HAVE OF MORE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WHAT -- FOR THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING -- WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS OF THINGS THAT COULD BE USED AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT -- TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS.
