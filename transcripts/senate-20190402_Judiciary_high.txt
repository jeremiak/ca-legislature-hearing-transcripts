GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER MONNING AND WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THE YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON ON THE ANALYSIS OF FOR SB. SIX FORTY FIVE MEMBERS SB SIX FORTY FIVE PROTECT DYING VICTIMS WHO SUFFER FROM TO SPECIFIC DISEASES. MESOTHELIOMA AND SILICOSIS FROM DAYS AND DAYS OF ABUSE OF DEPOSITION QUESTIONING IN CIVIL CASES. THIS BILL ADDRESSES A RECURRING PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM EXISTS BECAUSE OF AN UNINTENDED LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ENACTED IN TWENTY TWELVE LIMITED MOST DEPOSITIONS TO SEVEN HOURS THE SAME IS IN FEDERAL MATTERS. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE INITIALLY COVERED ALL CIVIL CASES BUT AFTER DISCUSSIONS IN HEARINGS THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE BILL TO INCLUDE VERY SIX SECTIONS TO THE SEVEN HOUR LIMIT. EXCEPTIONS FOR EXPERT IN OTHER SPECIALIZED WITNESSES FOR ALL EMPLOYMENT CASES AND FOR COMPLEX CASES. HOWEVER IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT TO EXEMPT DYING PATIENTS FROM THE SEVEN HOUR LIMIT AND SUBJECT TO THEM TWO DAYS AND DAYS OF CROSS EXAMINATION. BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND IT'S NOT HUMANE. DESPITE CURRENT LAW DEPOSITIONS OF END STAGE MESOTHELIOMA PATIENTS ALMOST ALWAYS INVOLVES TWENTY HOURS OR MORE OF QUESTIONING BY DEFENDANTS. THIS IS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW INCLUDES A LOOPHOLE WHICH ALLOWS ONE SIZE FITS ALL CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS TO OVERRIDE EVERYTHING IN THE LAW. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF IS CLOSE TO DYING. UNDERSTAND THAT SEVEN HOURS OF ON THE RECORD INTERROGATION OF A DYING MESOTHELIOMA WE'RE SILICOSIS PATIENT IS STRESSFUL BECAUSE IT GENERATES TAKES A FULL TWO OR THREE DAYS OF TIME. TO RECORD THE SEVEN HOURS OF DEPOSITION. SB SIX FORTY FIVE DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER DETAILS OF THE COURT'S CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS IT ADDRESSES ONLY THE TIME ALLOWED DEFENDANTS TO INTERROGATE DYING PATIENTS. DURING THE DEPOSITION. NO LIMITS ON INTERROGATORIES SB SIX FORTY FIVE WOMEN'S DEPOSITIONS OF DYING MESOTHELIOMA AND SILICOSIS PATIENTS TO SEVEN HOURS. IN ADDITION THE COURT IN ITS DISCRETION MAY GRANT UP TO THREE MORE DEPOSITION HOURS UPON REQUEST BY DEFENSE COUNSEL IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS. AS LONG AS THE HEALTH OF THE DEPONENT DOES NOT APPEAR ENDANGERED BY THE GRANT OF THE ADDITIONAL TIME. YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY WITNESSES MACHEL BROCK MEYER. SHE WAS AT HER FATHER'S DEPOSITION IN A TYPICAL CASE HE% WAS DEPOSED FOR TWELVE DAYS. HIS ATTORNEYS TRIED TO USE EXISTING LAW TO LIMIT THE INTERROGATION BUT THE COURT APPLIED ITS CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER AND WOULD NOT ALLOW SUCH LIMITATION. THIS MICHELLE WILL REPORT THE TWELVE DAY DEPOSITION WAS EXTREMELY DEBILITATING. YOU ALSO HEAR FROM JEREMY SMITH OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. WHO REPRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS AND SILICA? MEMBERS SENATE BILL SIX FORTY FIVES IN NARAL BILL THAT WILL GREATLY HELP VICTIMS OF TWO VERY SPECIFIC DISEASES BECAUSE THESE DISEASES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL AND TERMINAL. IT WILL SURE THESE VICTIMS ARE TREATED HUMANELY IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. DURING THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THEIR LIVES. AGAIN ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WILL DEFER TO THE CHAIR TO HEAR FROM MY WITNESSES. THESE FILES IN FRONT OF ME CONTAIN -- CORD MANAGEMENT BORDERS THE ARE VERY DETAILED CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS BUT WHICH RECOGNIZE MUCH OF THE WORK IS DONE THROUGH WRITTEN INTERROGATORIES. OFTEN REPEATED BY MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS ANSWERED BY THE DYING PLAINTIFF WHO THEN GETS ASKED THE SAME QUESTIONS ONCE AGAIN. IN PROTRACTED DEPOSITION AND I WILL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING THERE IS A SELF INTEREST IN RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK BECAUSE THE PLAINTIFF WHO DIES DURING THE CASE IS ELIGIBLE. FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES ONLY. THE PLAINTIFF WHOSE CASE CAN BE RESOLVED THE FAMILY CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROCEEDS FROM-PAIN AND SUFFERING AWARD. SO WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. WOULD LIKE TO DEFER TO MY WITNESSES THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON -- IF YOU TO START WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M. MY NAME IS MICHELLE ROCK MEYER -- RICHARD LLOYD SMITH IS MY FATHER. I WORKED AS A DRY WYLER HIS ENTIRE LIFE. WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM AT HOME WHEN I WAS YOUNG. HIS HAIR WAS CRESTING WHITE WITH DRY WALL COMPOUND WITH MY BROTHER AND I SITTING IN HIS LAP. LITTLE DID HE KNOW A GOOD TIME OKAY. LITTLE DID HE KNOW. THE MATERIAL HE DATED A FOR SO MANY YEARS WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH. AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH MESOTHELIOMA. AND BEING TOLD HE ONLY HAD A FEW MONTHS TO LIVE. MY FATHER CHOSE TO FILE A LAWSUIT. WE DEBATED AND I CONTINUE TO DEBATE. WHETHER THE LAWSUIT WOULD BE WORTH THE STRESS THAT IT WOULD BRING. HE WAS A PROUD MAN AND HE INSISTED THAT WE FIND A RESPECTABLE ATTORNEY. TO TELL HIS STORY. THOUGH HE COULD TELL HIS STORY. HE THOUGHT MAYBE. IT WOULD HELP OTHERS. ALL THE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE THAT PUT US BUSTO STROKE PRODUCTS. BUSTERS IN DURABLE PRODUCTS. BECAUSE IT GAVE THEM PROFIT EVEN THOUGH THE NEW. IT WOULD INJURE AND KILL THOSE WHO USE THE PRODUCT. WE WERE TOLD THIS CASE WOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS AN ASBESTOS CASE COULD BE. THERE WERE TWENTY DEFENDANTS AND HIS ONLY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS WAS WORKING AS A DRY WALL OR THE DEPOSITION STARTED IN A LOCAL HOTEL ROOM. ULTIMATELY -- SHORTLY THEREAFTER MOVED TO MY HOUSE -- BECAUSE I CARED FOR MY FATHER AT THE END OF HIS LIFE. HIS ATTORNEY ASKED HIM QUESTIONS TO TELL HIS LIFE STORY I'M SORRY. THE QUESTIONING TOOK EIGHTEEN HOURS. I WAS PRESENT FOR ALL OF THE DEPOSITIONS BECAUSE I WAS MY FATHER'S CARE TAKER. MY DAD COULD ONLY US IN SIR QUESTIONS FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME. HE WE NEED TO TAKE BREAKS TO TAKE MEDICINE ASPIRATE THE MUCUS THAT CONSTANTLY GATHERED IN HIS MOUTH FROM HIS LUNGS. AND USE THE BATHROOM AND TRY TO GATHER STRENGTH FOR ANOTHER FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF QUESTIONING. DESPITE THOSE DEFENDANTS INTERROGATED MY FATHER FOR TWELVE DAYS SPANNING SIX WEEKS. AS HE WENT IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. INSTEAD OF ASKING HIM STRAIGHT FOR QUESTIONS LIKE DID YOU USE MY PRODUCTS. THEY WERE ASKING HIM QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHETHER HE COULD REMEMBER THE ADDRESS OF EVERY BUILDING HE EVER STOPPED AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT THEIR GOAL WAS TO SEE IF HE COULD SURVIVE THE DEPOSITION. HIS ATTORNEY AT A HAVE A VISE US THAT IF HE DID NOT COMPLETE THE DEPOSITIONS NO MATTER HOW LONG THEY LASTED. BUT A JUDGE WOULD LIKELY EXCLUDE THE ENTIRE DEPOSITION FROM BEING USED IN HIS TRIAL. OUR ATTORNEY EVEN ASKED THE JUDGE TO LIMIT THE DEPOSITIONS TIME. OF THE DEFENDANTS. TO FOURTEEN HOURS. BUT THE DEFENDANT'S WOULDN'T STOP. AND THE JUDGE. DID NOT LIMIT THE TIME. MY DAD'S ENTIRE GOAL AT THE END OF HIS LIFE. HIS FOCUS TO SEE IF HE COULD FINISH THE UNLESS DEPOSITIONS HE DID. HE DIED A WEEK LATER. I HAVE A PICTURE. OF PICTURES OF WINDSOR. WITH THE WHEN THE BIG DEPOSITION STARTED. AND THE LAST DAYS OF HIS TOP OF US. THE DEFENDANTS LAWYERS DID THEIR JOB AND TOOK EVERY STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE ABOUT THEY COULD. BUT IT WAS IN HUMANE TO ALLOW THEM TO INTERROGATE MY FATHER THIS WAY. I DON'T WOMEN LAWYERS FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT RULES. BUT I HOPE THAT HIS SUFFERING AND RTELLING. THE STORY. CAN HELP CHANGE THE RULES AND PROTECT OTHERS IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT MY DAD HOPED TO DO BY EVEN BRINGING A CASE. HE WANTED TO BRING OUT HOW UNFAIR IT WAS. THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH A DANGEROUS. DEATH INDUCING POISON WITHOUT ANY WARNING. HE HPED HE COULD PROTECT OTHER WORKERS IN THE FUTURE. AND I HOPE TO HELP THEM AS WELL. IF THEY ARE DYING AND FACING IN HUMANE DEPOSITIONS. I ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN DOING WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY OBVIOUSLY WILL LET IT GO A LITTLE LONGER APPROPRIATELY SO BUT NO NO NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR APPRECIATE YOUR STORE. IF YOU COULD PROCEED IF YOU COULD DO THIS IN TWO MINUTES WITH A CHRISTIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. WE REPRESENT -- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN -- IN CALIFORNIA -- I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THEM TO ADVOCATE. ON BEHALF OF THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM THE COURT SYSTEM DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. AND ALSO FOR THE THOUSANDS OF OUR MEMBERS WHO HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN EXPOSED TO AN ASBESTOS AND OR SILICON THEIR CAREERS AND WILL GET SICK EVENTUALLY. THE FOLKS WHO ARE STRUCK WITH THE TWO DISEASES WE ADDRESS THIS BILL GO THROUGH EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL DEATHS. MESOTHELIOMA IS AN INCURABLE CANCER OF THE CHEST WALL LINING RETURNS DENTISTS USE SURROUNDING THE LUNGS AND WITH THE TUMOR. MESOTHELIOMA PATIENTS DIE ON AVERAGE A YEAR AFTER DIAGNOSIS AS A TUMOR CRUSHES AND DROWNS IN FROM THE INSIDE. IT'S ONLY KNOWN CAUSE IS EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS. PHIL BECAUSE THIS. IS ALSO AN INCURABLE DISEASE CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO AND BREEDING AND SILICA DUST FROM CUTTING TILE GRANITE OR COURTS MATERIALS. SYMPTOMS CAN APPEAR FROM A FEW WEEKS TO MANY YEARS AFTER EXPOSURE. AND TYPICALLY WORSEN OVER TIME IS SCORING IN THE LUNGS OCCURS. THERE IS NO CURE FOR SILICOSIS THE VICTIM EVENTUALLY SUFFOCATES TO THAT. THOSE VICTIMS SHOULDN'T BE VICTIMIZED TWICE NOR SHOULD THIS THEIR SPOUSES OR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT THE HAZARDOUS ASBESTOS FIBERS ARE STILL OF THE CRYSTAL HOME ON THEIR CLOTHES. THAT ALSO HAPPENS FAMILY MEMBERS MEMBERS GET SICK FROM THIS EXPOSURE AS WELL. THE WORKERS DIDN'T GO TO WORK TO DIE. SB SIX FORTY FIVE WAS ABOUT TREATING THEM HUMANELY IN THEIR FINAL DAYS WHILE KEEPING THE PROCESS AS FAIR AS POSSIBLE. WHAT'S NOT FAIR IS THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THESE BOOKS AND YOU ARE JUST FOR DOING THEIR JOBS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE HAZARD SO THEY WERE UNABLE TO AVOID IT. WHAT'S NOT FAIR IS THE FACT THAT THEIR LIVES ARE BEING CUT SHORT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE OR FAILURE TO WARN ABOUT THE TOXIC MATERIALS. WHAT'S NOT FAIR IS THE UNNECESSARY STRESS OF ABUSE OF DEPOSITIONS WHEN THESE VICTIMS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND JUST JUSTICE. IN A CIVIL COURT SYSTEM AND TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE ENTITIES THAT BROUGHT THIS ON TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE SO THAT OTHERS ARE NOT VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION ROGER I VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIKE BELOW IT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL IN CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AS WE OPPOSED SB SIX THIRTY TWO A TWO YEARS AGO. WE CERTAINLY DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE GRAVITY OF THE ILLNESS I DID NOT LOSE A FAMILY MEMBER BUT I LOST A VERY GOOD FRIEND TO ME IS A DAILY ONLINE IT'S A GHASTLY DISEASE AND ALWAYS FATAL. ALMOST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BEST DOES BUT SOMETIMES IDIOPATHIC. THE ONLY THING WE DISAGREE WITH SENATOR MINING ON FUNDAMENTALLY IS THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS AN ACCIDENTAL OR UNINTENTIONAL ELEMENT. TO THE GOT -- BILL IN TWENTY TWELVE IN FACT THAT BILL CAREFULLY EXCLUDED CERTAIN TYPES OF CASES AND CASES THAT INVOLVE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS AND THAT WAS DONE WITH THIS BEST DOES IN MIND. IN THE HANDFUL OF COURTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE MOST OF THE ASBESTOS LITIGATION OCCURS AND THAT WOULD BE. ALAMEDA SAN FRANCISCO LA AND ORANGE. JUDGES WHO DO THIS EVERY DAY IN THE BIG COUNTIES ARE JUDGES WHO DO NOTHING BUT AS BEST AS CALENDARS AND THEY HAVE ADOPTED CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS WHICH UNIFORMLY HAVE ADOPTED A TWENTY HOUR DEPOSITION LIMIT. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF A SPOUSE DOES LITIGATION. AND THE FIRST UNIQUE AND MOST IMPORTANT UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES IS THAT THESE CASES OFTEN INVOLVE NAMING DOZENS OF DEFENDANTS IT'S NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON FOR THIRTY FORTY FIFTY OR MORE DEFENDANTS. TO BE NAMED IN IN THIS BEST DOES CLAIM -- AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY. WE DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN AS FAST AS LITIGATOR TO RECOGNIZE THE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE OF OF DEPOSING.% A PLAINTIFF BY SIX DEFENDANTS AS OPPOSED TO SIXTY WE SIMPLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SEVEN HOURS OR TEN HOURS HE IS SUFFICIENT TO TALK ABOUT THE FORTY OR FIFTY YEAR HISTORY. WHICH MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS IN THESE CLAIMS IT IS THAT EXPOSURE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE ONLY ISSUE -- BEFORE THE COURT -- THE TIED TO HIS BEST DOES IS CLEAR IT IS WHOSE PRODUCT WAS THE PLAINTIFF EXPOSED. TO AND AT ONE TIME THEY WERE TYPICALLY MILITARY SHIP BUILDING AND SHIP -- NAVAL OPERATIONS BUT IT CHANGED OVER TIME THEY CAN BE DO WHAT YOU DO IT YOURSELF HOME IMPROVEMENT PEOPLE WHO DEALT WITH THIS BEST DOES CANING CONTAINING MATERIALS. THEY CAN BE PEOPLE WHO CHANGED THEIR OWN BREAKS THEY'RE KNOWN AS SHADE TREE MECHANICS AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY DEFENDANTS TO GO THROUGH THE HISTORY AND DETERMINE. THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BY THE TO THE DEFENDANT'S PRODUCT AND MANY TIMES THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY COULD BE A LITTLE HARDWARE STORE THAT MAY HAVE SOLD AS BEST AS CONTAINING PRODUCTS. IT TAKES TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE PRODUCT WAS THE DEFENDANT HOW WAS THE PLAINTIFF EXPOSED. TO SECOND BOND SUMMARY JUDGMENT IT TAKES TIME FOR THAT AND THE BURDEN IS ON THE DEFENDANT TO DEVELOP THE FACTS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT A SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION. THESE OFTEN START WITH DOZENS OF DEFENDANTS AND BY THE TIME THEY GO TO TRIAL IF AT ALL THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF DEFENDANTS LEFT BECAUSE SOME HAVE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH DEPOSITIONS THAT THEIR PRODUCT. WAS NOT OR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. SO WE THINK THE PRACTICAL REALITY IS THAT. YOU COULD. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OF DEFENDANTS NAMED WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE PLAINTIFFS BAR AND WITHIN THE BURDEN PUT ON THE ON THE DEFENDANT. IT TAKES TIME AND JUDGES WHO DO THIS EVERY DAY HAVE DEVELOPED THESE CASE MANAGEMENT QUARTERS THANK YOU ALL WRAP IT UP. WE HAVE IN THE PAST YOU'VE ALREADY DONE FOUR MINUTES AND BECAUSE HE WAS NO ONE ELSE I GAVE YOU THE FOR BUT THANK YOU ARE WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH POINT VERY GOOD. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AT THE MICROPHONE. RIGHT NOT SEEING ANY WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I WOULD LIKE TO JUST START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS BILL. YOU KNOW -- LAWYERS DOING THEIR JOB ARE GOING TO TRY TO REPRESENT THEIR CLIENTS. AND THEY WILL. MEET HOPEFULLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IMPOSED UPON THEM BUT IF THEY ARE GIVEN AN EXPANSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY WILL USE IT. AND CLEARLY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND OUT A DEPOSITION WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAY END UP. CONFLICTING. BY WITH CONFLICTING STATEMENTS WHO WERE NOT AS ACUTELY ON THEIR GAME IF YOU WILL. BECAUSE OF THIS DISEASE BOB PART OF THE GOAL WILL BE TO TRIP THEM UP TO GET THEM TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT IN PART. BECAUSE ARE EXHAUSTED AND THEY'RE IN PAIN. AND AND AND THERE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO PARTICIPATE -- SO I'VE SEEN THIS IS AN ATTORNEY I PRACTICED LAW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS I'VE SEEN ALL THE GAMES -- AND I I DON'T BELITTLE THE BEHAVIOR IT'S PART OF WHAT YOU DO TO REPRESENT YOUR CLIENT -- BUT AS FAR AS THE COURTS ARE CONCERNED BY IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE WILL BE IMPOSING CERTAIN RULES AND AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE COURTS AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT I THINK THAT. HAS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET POLICY AND TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. IF WE ALLOW SEVEN HOURS OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE DEPOSITION -- I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WILL GET TOGETHER. AND THEY WILL PREPARE A SEVEN HOUR DEPOSITION THAT COVERS THE QUESTIONS THAT OTHERWISE THEY TAKE FIFTY HOURS. TO A DEVELOPING AND I CAN THINK OF WAYS TO DO IT YOU JUST SIMPLY ASK -- IN X. YEAR. WHERE WERE YOU WORKING? COMPANY ABC INDY AND THE LAWYERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE THAT THEIR DEFENDANTS. OF A COMPANY IS MENTIONED IN THAT ONE SENTENCE AND CAN. HAVE THAT. EXAMINATION FOLLOW WITH GROUP GREATER SPEED AND SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE NEEDS OF THESE. PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY DYING AND I APOLOGIZE THAT. YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS BUT APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY -- I THINK THAT THIS IS A A REASONABLE -- BUILD ADDING ADDITIONAL TIME IF THE DEFENSE. CAN SHOW BECAUSE AS TO WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT THREE HOURS. BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE DEPOSITIONS WHEN YOU HAVE NEW LAURIE SHASTA SAME QUESTIONS. ON BEHALF OF A DIFFERENT DEFENDANT -- AGAIN MOST LAWYERS ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT ALL INTO A SEVEN HOUR PACKAGE. AND CLEVER ENOUGH TO PUT IT INTO A SEVENTY OUR PACKAGE IF THEY THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO ADVANCE THEIR CLIENTS BECAUSE I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE IT'S OUR DUTY TO REALLY SAID POLICY ON WHAT WE ARE GOING TO PERMIT AND NOT PERMIT SO -- I THINK IT CREATES REASONABLE LIMITS -- IN TAYLOR'S THE THE APPLICATION. TO THOSE WHO HAVE SO LITTLE TIME LEFT IN WHO ARE SUFFERING VERY PAINFUL DEATHS BECAUSE OF THIS HORRIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO WILL. APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND AND YOU FOR COMING FOR ANALYST'S MUST'VE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND FOR THE ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WERE DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO -- IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR BORDERS YOU. BY THE WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMPELLING -- TESTIMONY I KNOW IT'S EARLY COULD HAVE BEEN USING -- I'D LIKE TO DIRECT MY QUESTIONS -- TO SENATOR MONNING -- IT SEEMS AS IF THIS IS A IT'S A BALANCE OF DUE PROCESS. HOW DO WE LOOK AFTER THE INTEGRITY OF OUR JUDICIAL PROCESS? WHILE ALSO MAKING CERTAIN THAT DOESN'T UNFAIRLY BURDEN THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY AGGRIEVED -- WERE NEARING THEIR TIME -- ON THIS EARTH [inaudible] AND LIKE ANYTHING AT ALL GOOD LEGISLATION I THINK HAS A BALANCED APPROACH. AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. I CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE THAT ARE HOW CERTAIN ADVOCATES BY USE STRATEGIC DELAYS. IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. BUT I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS -- ONE IS WERE THERE ANY TIME ASSESSMENTS -- OR STUDIES. OR EXPERT -- IT YEAH ADVICE OFFERED INTO WHETHER SEVEN TO TEN HOURS IS APPROPRIATE AS OPPOSED. TO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YES IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THE ANSWER IS YES. BUT WE CAME AT IT. FROM THROUGH THE OTHER LANDS OF LIFE REMAINING THE QUALIFICATION IN THIS BILL IS THAT IT DR. HAS A TESTED THE YOU HAVE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE AND SO THE CLOCK IS RUNNING. THAT PLAINTIFF IS GOING TO DIE WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE KNOW IN THE CASE OF MISTER SMITH -- MICHELLE'S FATHER. HE WAS DEPOSED FOR FOURTEEN HOURS. BUT IT SPANNED THIRTY FIVE DAYS IN A SHE TESTIFIED. WHEN HE WAS CLOSE TO DEATH HE COULDN'T SUSTAIN ANSWERING QUESTIONS FROM MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME? WHAT THIS DISEASE REPLICATE IS DROWNING THE LUNGS FILL WITH -- WASTE AND IT'S YOU YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DROWNING SO WE CAME AT IT FROM. LESS SIX MONTHS OR LESS TO LIVE. AND THEN. AVERAGED THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION AVERAGE DEPOSITIONS BEING. TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS AND AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT OFTEN LOT OF DUPLICATION IN THAT. SO WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SEVEN HOURS PLUS THREE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE SEVEN HOURS IS NOT GENERALLY GOING TO BE. ONE DEPOSITION PERIOD IT'S GOING TO EXPAND PROBABLY TWO DAYS MAYBE THREE DAYS AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE WEAKNESS. OF THE DEPONENT -- WE DID THROUGH NEGOTIATION ANOTHER STILL OPPOSITION BUT WE'VE TRIED TO FIND A BALANCE AND WE DO -- DEFERRED THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO ADD THREE HOURS -- IN THAT JUDGE CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONDITION OF THE PATIENT. AND IF IF THE DEFENSE IS MADE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT. FACT OF THE MATTER IS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF QUESTIONS ASKED BY MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS RELATING ANSWERS ALREADY INCLUDED IN INTERROGATORIES. PLACE OF WORK TYPE OF WORK ADDRESS OF THE WORKPLACE THE RELATION OF THE WORK -- IN THOSE ALL GET REPEATED THEN IN THE DEPOSITION TO SEE IF THAT DYING PATIENT. IS PALM. IN A PERIOD MAYBE OF IN COHERENCE -- THEY CAN CONTRADICT WHAT WAS IN THE WRITTEN INTERROGATORIES SIR LAND SO I I I CERTAINLY CAN IMAGINE. HOW THAT'S? HOW THAT'S BEEN DONE AND CONTINUES TO BE DONE -- IT'S FIND THAT BALANCE -- IN MAYBE YOU FOUND IT MAYBE NOT -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS TO FROM MY STANDPOINT I'M JUST ONE MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE OTHERS MAY FEEL DIFFERENTLY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY -- WHILE STILL ACHIEVING THAT SAME RESULTS -- BUT MY LAST QUESTION IS. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO THIS REALLY LIMITED TO JUST THESE TWO MEDICAL CONDITIONS? IF LIFE EXPECTANCY IS IT SIX MONTHS FOR LASSEN THAT'S OBJECTIVELY -- DIAGNOSED. BY A BOARD CERTIFIED -- DOCTOR. WHY WOULDN'T THIS APPLY TO OTHER FORMS OF -- CANCER STRICKEN PATIENTS ORANYONE ELSE SIMILARLY SITUATED. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION IN AN AMENDMENT THAT I MIGHT. WILLINGLY CONSIDER I THINK THE REASON WE FOCUSED IN. ON MESOTHELIOMA IN SILICA IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE -- INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS CAUSED. SOME DEATHS FROM EXPOSURE THAT ONCE THE DIAGNOSIS IS MADE IT IS TERMINAL AND IF WE OPEN THAT ALL. END OF LIFE LITIGATION -- IT COULD POSE OTHER QUESTIONS LACK OF CERTAINTY AND DIAGNOSIS WITH OTHER CANCER DIAGNOSES AT CETERA. WE WERE VERY CONFIDENT. OF WHAT THE COURSE OF OF LIFE AND DEATH IS WITH EXPOSURE TO THESE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SO AND IN ITS WHERE. THE PROBLEM IS BEEN IDENTIFIED -- NOT JUST BY. LAWYERS BUT BY FAMILIES SO ALL ALL LAST MY FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. THAT YOU MAKE THIS. FOR MEDICAL TERMINALLY DIAGNOSED MEDICAL CONDITIONS SIX MONTHS OR LESS. THAT IS NOT BE LIMITED TO THESE SPECIFIC TO I THINK IT IS SHOULD BE ACROSS THE BOARD IN MY OPINION -- BUT THAT'S UP FOR YOU TO COME TO CONSIDER. AND THAT THE OUR RANGE BE DOUBLED. IS LONG AS IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE. YEAH I WOULD ACT AS THAT YOU JUST CONSIDER THAT FOR YOUR OWN THIRD DIVISION. THANK YOU CAN BUT I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE AMENDMENTS HERE AT THIS POINT IN TIME YOU CAN CERTAINLY AMAZON BUTTON TO TAKE ANY AMERICAN THANK YOU JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. SENATOR -- I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF YOUR QUESTIONS GLAD TO INVESTIGATE THOSE IN AND STAY IN A DIALOGUE WITH YOU -- THE SECOND SUGGESTION I THINK THE PROBLEM THERE WOULD BE YOU DON'T HAVE A JUDICIAL OFFICER IN THE DEPOSITION. AND SO DO CLICK IT IF QUESTIONS START BEING ANSWERED YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON IN THE DEPOSITION. GO BACK TO THE COURT IN SEEKING JUDICIAL. SOME DIRECTION AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE ASKING -- DUPLICATIVE QUESTIONS AND THEN FOR THE LIFE OF THE PLAINTIFF THE PATIENT. THE METER DOESN'T PAUSE FOR THEM THEY CONTINUE AND AS I POINTED OUT BEFORE. THE WAY THE DAMAGES WORK. THERE'S ACTUALLY A SELF INTEREST IN KEEPING. KEEPING THE DEPOSITIONS GOING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANY DEFENSE COUNSEL DO THAT. BUT WE DEAL WITH HUMAN NATURE. AND DOLLARS AND CENTS IN THESE CASES DAHLE ELDERLY RESERVE MY JUDGEMENT. ON THAT THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF THIS BUT I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF MERIT AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS WE HAVE A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY BEFORE WE HAVE YOU CLOSE SENATOR. LET'S. CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HERE. JACKSON HERE GORGEOUS.

SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED CENTER MONNING THE FOR A EXCUSE ME SENATOR REQUIRE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR UP FOR ALL OF HER WORK ALONG WITH HER FANTASTIC STAFF. IN A WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MISTER MONEY IS WELL SO A GOOD STAFF -- THINNER WIENER AND HE DOES APOLOGIZE CITY CANNOT BE HERE TODAY HE'S PRESENTING A RATHER LARGE HOUSING BUILT THE MOMENT -- WE ARE HONORED TO BE A pPRESIDENTIAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AS WE ALL KNOW MEMBERS TRANSPARENCY IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE IN HIS FOOT -- IT IN ITS TRANSPARENCY THAT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT. FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS -- EVERY US PRESIDENT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE HAVE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. AND I TO SAY THEY'RE PATRIOTS THAT THEY PUT THE NATION'S INTERESTS ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE. IN PRESIDENT'S ARE EXPECTED PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS DECIDE WHETHER IT BE BUSINESS TIES OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. AND THEY DO THIS FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT GREATER GOOD IS AMERICAN SECURITY IN THE PROTECTION OF OUR PEOPLE. INCOME TAX RETURNS FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ESSENTIAL INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEALINGS FINANCIAL STATUS AND CHARITABLE DONATIONS. AND WHILE THE RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS MADAM CHAIR AS PART CONVERSATION IN OF COURSE DEBATE IN THE PAST. ALL CANDIDATES TO RUN HAVE PUT THEIR DISCOMFORT ASIDE FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES BECAUSE THE RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS HAS BECOME A TIME HONORED TRADITION IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT IN THIS LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP REFUSED TO RELEASE HIS INCOME TAX RETURNS THE NINE VOTERS. THE OPPORTUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO FULLY EVALUATE HIS FITNESS FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES. SB TWENTY SEVEN INSURERS IT FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL BE BARRED FROM APPEARING IN THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY BALLOT UNLESS THE RELEASE OF TAX RETURNS A VOTERS -- PRESSING ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED FAR BEFORE ELECTION DAY BECAUSE UNLIKE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND FEDERAL APPOINTEES. PRESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE VICE PRESIDENT I'D STATES ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS THAT MEANS ALL OF US IS A MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM. SANITARY DISTRICT COMMISSIONERS ABOARD THE SUPERVISORS DISCLOSE MORE INFORMATION THROUGH MANDATED CONFLICT OF INTEREST DOCUMENT FILINGS AND THE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT I'D STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE. AND NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS THE SHAPE TAX POLICY WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE RICHEST AMERICANS. THERE'S IN SHAPING INTERNATIONAL POLICY WHICH COULD ENRICH THEMSELVES. AND AMERICAN PUBLIC IS NO WAY TO KNOW BECAUSE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS AT THIS POINT IN TIME OUR OWN DICKS DISCLOSE. NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A STRONG EXAMPLE OF THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION BUT MADAM CHAIR I ASSURE YOU HE'S NOT THE ONLY. ONE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC PERSON OR POLITICAL PARTY IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. CALIFORNIA VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BEFORE CASTING THEIR VOTES AS AMERICANS. AND IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT RELEASING HER TAX RETURNS WOULD BE RIGHT HERE TALKING WITH ALL OF YOU ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. I'M GOING TO END IT HERE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BILL'S GOING TO DO AND THEN MADAM CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER FOR TOO MANY TESTS MONEY FOR EACH OF THE FOLKS WERE UP HERE WITH US. NUMBER ONE THIS BILL WOULD MANDATE A CANADA FOR PRESENT IN ORDER TO HAVE HIS OR HER NAME PLACED ON THE ELECTION BALLOT THE FILE HIS OR HER INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE FIVE MOST RECENT. TAXABLE YEARS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE BEFORE THAT ELECTION WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT MISS MARKETS HERE WHO IS REPRESENTING SECRETARY STATE TO DO WHO'S IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IN ORDER TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THE SECTORS STATE WILL REACT THE INCOME TAX RETURNS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. I'D I'D LIKE TO BE A TO POINT OUT TO MY RIGHT -- WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE ARE TWO SAMPLES BY THE WAY DO YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE LISTS AND IMAGES WILL COME UP? A BOTH PRESIDENT BUSH IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND PRESENT OBAMA IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO SECURITY NUMBERS ARE REDACTED CONSIDERATION LIKE PHONE NUMBERS REDACTED BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE. THIS IS JUST A SAMPLING OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE WEB EVEN AS WE SPEAK. RETURNS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON THE SECRETARY CITY'S WEBSITE. AND HAD TO SAY STATES HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN PROVIDING CHECKS AND BALANCES THE FEDERAL POLICY. IN SB TWENTY SEVEN IS SIMPLY A BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENT OF RELEASING TAX RETURNS AND IT'S LIKE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE NOW. SO FOR EXAMPLE TO BE A RUN FOR OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN THE SIGNATURE GATHERING REQUIREMENTS. WE SET OUR FILING FEES THE MIDDLE DEADLINES FOR THE SECRETARY STATE. EVERYONE WHO HAS TO FILE A TAX RETURN. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS LAW. IF YOU DON'T FILE A TAX RETURN YOU'RE STILL SUBJECT TO THIS LAW AND ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO BE ON THAT PRIMARY BALLOT. SB TWENTY SEVEN IS UNLIKE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ABOUT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRIED IN OTHER STATES. SOME STATES TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT TERM LIMITS ON FEDERAL OFFICES CLEARLY WE CANNOT DO THAT IS A STATE. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR LANGUAGE NEXT ONE'S NAME IN THE BALLOT SCENE AND THEY SERVED TOO MANY TERMS. ALL IN IT RIGHT HERE MADAM CHAIR AND SAY THIS. THE ETHICS COUNSEL FOR BOTH GEORGE W. BUSH RICHARD PAINTER. AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA MISTER ICE IN EVERY VIEW THIS LANGUAGE. AND THEY DECLARE THAT THEY BELIEVE IT STANDS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY TEST. OTHER PEOPLE CAN DEBATE THE POINT WHAT BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS USED. TO PARTISAN EXPERTS AGREE IN THAT THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST AND REVIEW THE PUBLIC CAN GET. I ABBY WOULD HEAR PROFESSOR AT THE U. S. C. GOLD STILL SCHOOL OF LAW WILL BE SPEAKING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND FOR THE SECOND TIME TODAY SHE IS EXCITED TO BE HERE. DANG SECONDLY WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER MISS TIFFANY MARK IS A DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS OF CALIFORNIA SECTOR STATES OFFICE VENTURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. VERY MUCH WHICH OF YOU IS GOING TO START WANTED TO GO AHEAD INTRODUCE YOURSELF YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ABBY WOULD. I AM -- AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY AT USC BUT I SPEAK ON MY OWN BEHALF TODAY. THE MY ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF US BE TWENTY SEVEN IS THAT UNDER THE CURRENT CASE LAW THE BILL SHOULD BE UP UNTIL THIS CONSTITUTIONAL. WE HAVE NO CASE DIRECTLY ON POINT -- SOME OF THE EXISTING CASES WERE NARROWLY DECIDED SO PREDICTION IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE EXISTING PRECEDENT ASK SENATOR MCGUIRE SAID INDICATES THE COURTS WOULD RULE THAT SB. TWENTY SEVEN IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE BALLOT ACCESS LAW THAT DOES NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENCY. NOW WITHOUT REHASHING ARGUMENTS ON THE REALLY GOOD MEMO THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED ALREADY FROM THE COMMITTEE'S LAWYERS I'M JUST GONNA USE MY TIME TO BOLSTER A CASE MADE IN THAT MEMO -- AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW MY RESEARCH IS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE TRANSPARENCY SO I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF DISCUSS WHAT WE KNOW EMPIRICALLY ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THESE TYPES OF THINGS. THE MEMO RIGHTFULLY POINTS TO THE DICTA IN A CASE CALLED AL ANDERSON SKEWS ME THE CELEBRATE ST IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT SAID. THAT STATE THE STATE HAS A LESS IMPORTANT INTEREST IN REGULATING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THAN STATEWIDE OR LOCAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE THE OUTCOME WILL LARGELY BE DETERMINED BY VOTERS OUTSIDE THE STATE'S BOUNDARIES. THE COMMITTEE'S LAWYERS WERE RIGHT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS LANGUAGE BUT IT DOES NOT PRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO SB TWENTY SEVEN'S CONSTITUTIONALITY. SB TWENTY SEVEN WOULD REGULATE ONLY THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY. AND ELECTION DECIDED WHOLLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA. EVEN IF THE DICTUM FROM ANDERSON WERE TO APPLY IT MERELY DISCOUNTS THE STATE'S INTEREST THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD CLAIM IN DEFENDING THE LAW THE INTEREST THAT CALIFORNIA HAS CLAIMED. ARE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN UP HELD REPEATEDLY BY THE SUPREME COURT AND ALSO INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SOMEWHAT SIMILAR FACT PATTERN IN THE FIFTH CIRCUIT -- WHERE THE STATE? REQUIRED CANDIDATES TO FILE TAX RETURNS OR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES THAT WAS STATE CANDIDATES THERE. I CLOSE MY ADDRESSING PRIOR COMMENTARY ON SB TWENTY SEVEN IN THE LAST HEARING ON THIS BILL MISTER RICHARD WINGER. RAISE THE ISSUE OF PROCEDURAL VERSUS SUBSTANTIVE BALLOT ACCESS PROVISIONS RIGHTLY POINTING OUT THAT OUR MAIN NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION ON BALLOT ACCESS FROM A CASE CALLED SCHAEFER BE TOWNS AND MENTIONS THE DISTINCTION AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THAT PANEL ON WHICH MY JUDGE SAT. AND ACTUALLY RICHARD PAINTER ALSO CLERKED FOR JUDGE IN IN -- NO COURT HAS EXPLAINED HOW WE DETERMINE WHETHER A BALLOT ACCESS RESTRICTION IS PROCEDURAL OR SUBSTANTIVE IN NATURE. I THINK THAT THAT DISTINCTION IS ACTUALLY ON HELPFUL IN ABOUT THE PANEL WOULD AGREE BECAUSE IN THAT VERY OPINION IT CARVED OUT AN EXCEPTION. TO THE IMPERMISSIBLE SUBSTANTIVE CATEGORY FOR LAWS THAT ESTABLISH A BASE OF SUPPORT I'M GOING TO COULD YOU WATCH FIRE I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WE HAVE EIGHT EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A FAIRLY. COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS -- IF THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SO AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THE WITNESSES THERE WAS CERTAINLY -- A INVITE FURTHER KERR CONVERSATION PRE SHAVE YOUR TESTIMONY THE NEXT WITNESS IF THE MARK ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE OUT EXPEDIA WE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AS AN IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY MEASURE FOR VOTERS. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARCHER I VOTE. WE HAVE A MINUTE AND FORTY SEVEN SECONDS HAD ANYTHING FOR THE WANT TO SAY OR JUST THAT YOU ARE IN SUPPORT THAT WERE IN ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SO PLEASE STEP FORWARD WITH YOUR NAME. AND AFFILIATION. THANK YOU TERRY JACKSON MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE STEP FORWARD YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON IF YOU WILL STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO PRESENT. YOUR CASE EACH ONE OF YOU A RICHARD WINGER WITH BALLOT ACCESS NEWS. WHICH YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING TO HANDOUTS ONE IS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION FROM HAWAII. THING THIS KIND OF A LAW AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND YESTERDAY THE HAWAII. HOUSE DEFEATED THE WHOLE LIFE A BILL SENATE BILL NINETY FOUR THE SENATE BACK TO COMMITTEE. THE OTHER HAND OUT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN. STATE THIS FORTY CASES HERE IN A HUNDRED YEARS. FOR A HUNDRED YEARS EVER SINCE WE'VE HAD GOVERNMENT PRINTED BALLOTS STATES HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO VIOLATE. WHAT THE FOUNDERS WANTED FOR THE COUNTRY THE FOUNDERS? THE THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION WAS VERY UNDEMOCRATIC BUT IT HAD ONE RADICALLY DEMOCRATIC ASPECT TO IT. ANYONE WHO WAS AGE [inaudible] TWENTY FIVE AND A CITIZEN COULD RUN FOR THE HOUSE. THAT WAS SHOCKING BECAUSE BACK THEN EVERY SINGLE STATE YOU COULD BE IN THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS YOU OWN PROPERTY. HAMILTON SAID THE TRUE PRINCIPLE OF A REPUBLIC IS THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD CHOOSE WHOM THEY PLEASE TO GOVERN THEM. THIS GREAT SOURCE OF FREE GOVERNMENT POPULAR ELECTION SHOULD BE PERFECTLY PEER AND THE MOST UNBOUNDED LIBERTY ALLOWED. AND LIVINGSTON SAID THE PEOPLE ARE THE BEST JUDGES WHO WANT TO REPRESENT THEM. TO DICTATE AND CONTROL THEM TO TELL THEM HOME THEY SHALL NOT ELECT IS TO BRIDGE THEIR NATURAL RIGHTS. I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. PUTTING OUT THEIR TAX RETURNS BUT THIS BILL IS AN ATTACK ON VOTING RIGHTS. IT SAYS PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T. NOW IN 2016406% OF THE VOTERS. CHOSE TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THIS BILL. TRAMPLES VOTING RIGHTS THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS ON POLANSKI. REPRESENT MYSELF. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY ALSO THE PREVIOUS ONE ONE FORTY NINE FOR SOMETIME. AND THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT LET'S SAY THAT. I SAID I AM OPPOSING THIS BUT I THINK THAT TAX RETURNS ALONE -- TOO LITTLE TO INFORM THE ELECTORATE THAT VOTERS. THERE'S JUST NOTHING THERE GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. IMAGINE MICHAEL KORIE ALONE HAND HOW CAPONE DECIDING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THEY GIVE YOU THEIR TAX RETURNS WITH A SMILE. THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE COVERING THEM. THEY ARE GOING TO HAND YOU SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO INCRIMINATE THEM SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT WHERE DID THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. HOW MUCH ARE THEY MAKING WHAT TAX BRACKET -- THE IN. WHAT IS THAT? TO THAT SEEMS TO BE A WASTE OF OUR TIME. THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL THAT I HAVE. THAT RESOLVE THE ISSUES OF TRANSPLANT MAKE THINGS TRANSPARENT THAT ARE VALUABLE. DON'T ARE DEFECTED BY LEGAL CHALLENGES. THIS THIS IS GONNA BE HARD TO BELIEVE BUT THE PROPOSAL I HAVE FOR MAKING CHANGES TO THIS. SENATE BILL -- TWENTY SEVEN QUICK START HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE. IMPLEMENTED. VOTERS WOULD START RECEIVING VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT CANDIDATES. THE RISK OF LITIGATION QUAGMIRES WITH THE AVOID. THE SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT IS LOW COST CREATES NO NEW BARACK BUREAUCRACY. HOLD YOUR BREATH. A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT WOULD PROVIDE CANDIDATES WITH A FORMAL SERVICE. RATHER THAN ESTABLISH A BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. A VOLUNTARY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION SERVICE WOULD SELL BOTH. THE EFFORTS TO KEEP EPIC KASEY PROBLEM AND LEGAL BATTLE PROBLEMS. AND A BE A STRONG DETERRENT. HI THIS IS THE SENATE CANDIDATE DETERRENT. THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE CAPABLE OF DISCOVERING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES WITHOUT RELEASING ANY PUBLIC INFORMATION. THIS PUTS THE DESIGNERS CANDIDATE IN A QUANDARY. THEY FACE A DILEMMA THEY HAVE TWO OPTIONS THEY COULD VOLUNTEER AND HOPE THEY COVERED THEIR TRACKS WILL WELL. MEMBERS DISCOVERY SO THAT COULD PUT HIM IN PRISON [inaudible] OR UNLIKE DECLINING TO MAKE TAX RETURNS PUBLIC. THE THE FOR LEGITIMATE REASONS IN SOME CASES. A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION WOULD MAKE NO PRIVATE INFORMATION PUBLIC. DOES LIMóN. LEGITIMATE REASONS TO DECLINE OR ABSENT. SO IF A CANDIDATE DECLINES TO VOLUNTEER THE PUBLIC IS VERY WEAK LIKELY TO AND FOR THAT THEY HIDING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I SUGGEST IF YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRESENT. AT OF SOME OTHER TIME -- TO SENATOR MCGUIRE -- WELL VERY VERY VERY INTERESTING CONCEPTS ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT -- MISTER CORLEONE IS TAX RETURNS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. THAT'S THE WAY OF COURSE. SOME MIGHT ARGUE MISTER CORLEY ANI ACTUALLY DID RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO THIS PAST ELECTION BUT SOME WOULD ARGUE. THAT -- THAT TAX RETURNS REGARDLESS ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND TO CRIMINAL SANCTION BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WHO'D LIKE TO STEP FOR WITH THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION ARE THERE ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT SEEING SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. MR BORDERS OF FALL BY MR STERN. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE -- FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR STATEMENTS TODAY. IS THIS. DOES THIS A PIECE LEGISLATION APPLY TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR'S VOLUNTARILY CAN BE RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS BUT MANDATORILY. DOES IT WITH THE SUPPLY TO EXECUTIVE STATEWIDE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA. NO WOULD NINE HERE'S THE REASON. WELL ACTUALLY IN ELLISVILLE WENT LIVE AT NINE OR LET HIM LET HIM GIVE HIS REASON. I MEAN IF IT DOESN'T APPLY COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHY DOESN'T APPLY ACTUALLY VERY QUICKLY SAID -- SO AS IS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE OR AS A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER WE ALREADY HAVE TO DISCLOSE MORE ON OUR FINANCES. UNDER THE PRESENT VICE PRESIDENT A NIGHT STATES AND WOULD WELCOME -- ANY MEMBER WOULD LIKE BETTER BRING FOR THE BILL -- TO BE ABLE TO DO SO BUT THIS SPECIFIC BILL. IS A VOTER EDUCATION MEASURE FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU OFFERING THE CLARIFICATION. I THINK THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE CREDIBILITY AT LEAST IN MY OPINION -- NOT JUST WITH ME BUT I THINK ALSO FOLKS ACROSS THE BOARD IF WE WOULD ALSO CONSIDER APPLYING THIS. TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO HAT MIGHT ALSO APPLY TO THE PRESENT PERSONALLY. I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED HIS HIS INFORMATION I THINK THERE'S A LEGACY AND THERE'S A THERE'S A PATTERN AND PRACTICE. FOR THAT IS STEAMED OFFICE THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN GOOD FORM. TO FOLLOW SUIT BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER I'M NOT ASKING UNITS REALLY TO DO SO RIGHT NOW -- THE CHAIR HAS BEEN. AS NEEDED -- CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY AMENDING THINGS. AT AT THIS JUNCTURE BUT I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY SERVE EVERYONE'S INTEREST WELL IF IT WERE APPLIED STATEWIDE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. AS WELL AS THAT PRINCIPLE EXECUTIVE NATIONAL OFFICE THANK YOU AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY YOUR OPPOSITION WOULD BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT. THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT. MOMENTS TO NEGOTIATE DIFFERENT TERMS WE DO THAT IN ADVANCE OF THE BILLS AND HEARINGS ARE TO PRESENT THE BILL AS PROFFERED AND AS OF THE COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED AMENDMENTSTHAT ARE EITHER TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN -- I WAS GOING TO GO TO SENATOR STIR BUT I KNOW THE SENATOR ALLEN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOME STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE. BUT I'VE JUST WITH THAT. WITH SO MUCH RESPECT TO THE CHAIR I MEAN WE YOU KNOW WE ONLY GOT THESE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS ABSOLUTELY WE UNDERSTAND HOW. I MEAN IT IT'S NOT A TYPICAL FOR MEMBERS. TO YOU RAISE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS AND AND THAT'S TOTALLY APPROPRIATE BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE A BACK AND FORTH WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY -- WOULD YOU CONSIDER EITHER NOW R IN THE FUTURE -- BUT THE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THESE MATTERS BUT OTHERWISE WE'LL BE HERE UNTIL -- NEXT TUESDAY IF WE START NEGOTIATING THEM HERE SORRY LE LET ME LOG CLEAR I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S THE THINK THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE VICE CHAIR WAS WAS TO MAKING SOME SUGGESTIONS I GUESS I WOULD JUST. I WOULD JUST -- THINK THAT THEY PERHAPS ONE ONE APPROACH AND I'M NOT NEGOTIATING THE BILL HERE BUT I'M JUST. PUTTING OUT A SUGGESTION. ARE GIVEN I THINK WHAT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM THE VICE CHAIR. TO GIVE THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THE OPTION. TO BUY THEIR RELEASE THE TAX REFORMS OR FILL OUT THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FORM. SEVEN HUNDRED SO THAT THAT THEY WOULD SIGNED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY SO THAT THERE WOULD BE THE POSSIBILITY OF BOB. YOU KNOW IF IF THAT WAS HE CHOICE OF THE CANDIDATE MAY BE UP TO THEM. ODD BUT BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT TO WHAT WE REQUIRE OF OUR GUBERNATORIAL AND STATEWIDE ELECTED [inaudible] FOLKS. I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE AS A SUGGESTION. THANK YOU AND I MIGHT MENTION AS THE AS THE SENATOR DID IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR WHEN HE RAN FOR GOVERNOR. PRODUCE FIVE YEARS OF HIS PRIOR TAX RETURN SO HE DID SO VOLUNTARILY. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SADLY HAS PROMISED -- TO SUBMIT HIS TAX RETURNS WHEN HE FIRST. RAN FOR OFFICE AND THEN SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE COURSE OF HIS. CAMPAIGN AND THEN FOLLOWING HIS -- SWEARING IN SO HE HAS ON MANY OCCASIONS PROMISED TO PRESENT THEM. AND ULTIMATELY FAILED TO DO SO SO JUST AS A FACTUAL MATTER IN THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTIONS AND PERHAPS SENATOR YOU WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD SENATOR STERN -- THANK YOU AM CHAIR SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING EARLIER AND SO LET THE FROM THE PROFESSORS HERE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE OVERSEAS SUBSTANTIVE. DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY MAY PERTAIN TO WHAT THE VICE CHAIR IN CENTER ALLEN OR TALKINGABOUT AS WELL IN TERMS OF HOW HOUSE OR TO NARROWLY CONSTRAINED WE MAKE THE THE AMBIT THAT WILL NEVER WHATEVER CANADA HAS TO GO. TO THROUGH IS THAT IT IS THAT A FACTOR IS SORT OF THIS THIS SORT OF EQUAL TREATMENT IDEA RIGHT. GOVERNOR DIDN'T HAVE TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS IT'S A VOLUNTEER BUT THE PAST TO FILL AN EMPTY PC FORM. SEVEN HUNDRED SO JUST IS IS THAT SIX LEGALLY SIGNIFICANT OR YEAH CLUES YOU HAVE FROM THE THAT IS THAT'S CLUE I THINK WE HAVE THE FIFTH CIRCUIT CASE APPLYING TO TO STATE. ELECTED OFFICIALS RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT -- WHERE THAT THE CHOICE WAS GIVEN BETWEEN A DISCLOSURE FORM THAT SEEM TO HAVE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT THAT TAX RETURN HAD? FOR A TAX RETURN. AND THAT WAS UP HELD -- YEAH AND SO I I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S ON DECENT FOOTING HERE -- PART OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR UPHOLDING IT WAS ABOUT REVEALING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS THE SAME KIND OF THING THAT THE SENATORS BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE TO ME BUT INTO WAR THAT THAT THAT'S IT WAS IN OR THAT'S RIGHT YEAH PATHWAYS AND WHO. IN THE HELL THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH ON THE PROCEDURE IN SUBSTANCE THING JUST TO KIND OF WRAP THAT UP IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LET ME -- I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE THE THE SOME OF THE THINGS ABOUT HELD DON'T REALLY FIT PROCEDURE. OKAY SO I THAT'S WHY I THINK THE DISTINCTIONS NO GOOD -- EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE NINTH CIRCUIT SO REQUIRING TO BE PEOPLE TO QUIT THEIR FEDERAL JOBS BEFORE RUNNING FOR OFFICE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS PROCEDURAL. REQUIRING PEOPLE IN THIS IS THE NINTH CIRCUIT CASE -- UP HOLDING A LAW REQUIRING ARIZONA'S ELECTED OFFICIALS TO WAIT UNTIL THE FINAL YEAR OF THEIR TERM TO RUN FOR FEDERAL OFFICE. SO THOSE DON'T FEEL PROCEDURAL TO ME RIGHT AND SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST -- COMMITTEE HEARING AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I BROUGHT THAT TO BEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTION PRE SHEET THE ANSWER. BY OTHERS MOTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. SENATOR GORE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MANAGER I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF FOR THE ABILITY TO PRESENT TODAY I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH A VICE CHAIR ON THIS ISSUE. HI IS WELL IN ONCE HE THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK WHEN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON THIS MISSION. OCEAN IS SO DO PASSED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS A MAN SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE FORGES. FOR JUST KNOW ALAN. ALLEN I A COUPLE EURO. MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. STERN AYE UMBERG. QUITE HEALTHY HI BUT BECAUSE HE I THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES FIVE TO ONE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATED. AND I'M SURE WE MAY SEE YOUR NAME ON THE BRIEFS YOU MAKERS PREFER GOING TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON THIS. A LOT OF ALL RIGHT WE WILL -- AGAIN TO GO IN FILE ORDER BUT THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BE ASKED TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER. NON COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE TESTIFIED SO WE HAVE HERE -- LET'S SEE SENATOR SKINNER IS NOT HERE -- BUT WE DO HAVE -- SHE'S ON CONSENT EXCUSE ME -- WE DO HAVE -- UP NEXT WOULD BE SENATOR DRAWS SO WHO IS NOT HERE. BUT WE DO HAVE SENATOR GLAZER SO SENATOR GLAZER IF YOU'D LIKE TO STEP FORWARD. THIS IS FILE ITEM. NINE SB. SIX FORTY FOUR GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR AND AGAIN REMINDER WITNESSES TWO MINUTES -- TO TO KEY WITNESSES -- MAIN WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. TO MAIN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION VERY GOOD. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WILL BE TAKING [inaudible] THAT'S CORRECT. HI MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR -- THIS LEGISLATION I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE RENTAL RENTAL RELIEF TO ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS ACTIVE DUTY. BASED IN CALIFORNIA BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT. SERVICE MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO MOVE INTO A RENTAL UNIT -- THIS BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST SERVICE MEMBERS. FOR HAVING TO PAYLESS SECURITY DEPOSIT. MY STAFF AND I ARE STILL EXPLORING WAYS TO ENFORCE THIS BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE DO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH MAKES IT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO FOR THE UP FRONT COST. OF MOVING INTO A RENTAL UNIT IN OUR STATE. WITH MILITARY BARRACKS BECOMING SCARCER THE NEED FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO FIND HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR STATION BECOMES MORE COMMON AND NECESSARY. NOW THOSE SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE A BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING FROM THE MILITARY. MANY SAY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE UP FRONT COSTS OF RENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE MEMBERS. I IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVER A LARGER ALLOWANCE DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. WHEN SERVICE MEMBERS FROM OTHER STATES MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IT OFTEN TAKES MONTHS FOR THE INCREASE ALLOWANCES TO KICK IN? SERVICE MEMBERS RESORT TO LOANS AND OTHER FORM OF CREDIT TO PAY THEIR SECURITY DEPOSIT AND FIRST MONTH'S RENT. AND THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF CONDUCT. THAT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH -- IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE THAN. ANY OTHER CIVILIAN. IF THEY DO NOT MEET THIS STANDARD THEY CAN BE REPRIMANDED BY THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER OR THE MILITARY. FOR EXAMPLE SERVICE MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET ALL THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS EVEN RENTAL CONTRACTS. IF THEY DO NOT THEY CAN BE REPRIMANDED AS I SAID BY THAT COULD THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER OR A MILITARY COURT THEY COULD BE DEMOTED. HAVE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEM OR EVEN DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY SERVICE. THESE PROVISIONS PROVIDE A HIGHER STANDARD FOR SERVICE MEMBERS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTED BY MANY DIFFERENT VETERAN GROUPS INCLUDING AMERICAN GI FORUM AND THAT'S AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES AND WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE RIVALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU WITNESSES PLEASE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICK ALLY ALLY I AM WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WOULD. THE AMERICAN GI FORUM -- BATES DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS AID SERVICE AGENCIES. AND CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY TWO BETTER AND ORGANIZATIONS ALL OF WHICH ARE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL -- SIX FORTY FOUR I WANT TO START BY THINKING SENATOR GLAZERS FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP SERVICE MEMBERS FORWARD. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE TO PAY FOR RENTAL UNITS. BY ONE MONTH. THE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS I REPRESENT BELIEVE THAT THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN OUR BASE IN CALIFORNIA MERIT YOUR HIGHEST CONSIDERATION FOR THE RENTAL RELIEF. THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. IT IS NOT EASY TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT STATE ON A SHORT NOTICE AFTER LEAVING SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR YEARS. BUT SERVICE MEMBERS TO DO IT. AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE ARMED FORCES MEANS. WHAT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS UNDER FAMILIES EAST TO AND? TO ENSURE IS THAT STRESSFUL PROCESS OF FINDING HOUSING IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN THEY ARE TOLD TO COME TO CALIFORNIA THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING? SERVICE MEMBERS MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF RELIEF. I AM AWARE I AM UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER PROFESSION WHERE IF YOU DO NOT RELOCATE TO WORKER TOLD YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB. THIS BILL IS A FAIR IN NECESSARY APPROACH TO MITIGATE IN THE PROBLEMS SERVICE MEMBERS FACE WHEN THEY MOVED TO CALIFORNIA. THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE CODIFIES THE STANDARD OF CONDUCT THAT SERVICE MEMBERS MUST FOLLOW WHICH PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR LAMBERT. LOOKING TO RECOUP ANY LOSS OF AS MENTIONED BEFORE IF FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT MET. SERVICE MEMBERS CAN FACE AMIR AT OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THIS FROM SERVICE MEMBERS TO FIX OUR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. THIS BILL IS A HELPFUL TOOL TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SERVICE MEMBERS FACED DURING THESE HISTORIC HOUSING CRISIS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATRINA JOHNSONAND I AM A WIFE TO AN ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER AND I AM TESTIFYING TODAY OF MY OWN ACCORD. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX FORTY FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER RENTER PROTECTION BILL PROPOSED BY SENATOR GLAZER. AS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND AS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA HAD THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. AND EXCEEDED THE SECOND HIGHEST STATE BY OVER 15%. THE QUANTITY OF MILITARY HOUSING HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DEMAND AND OFTEN REQUIRES MILITARY PERSONNEL TO RELY ON HOUSING WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN THE BAY AREA TO REQUIRE A SECURITY DEPOSIT. EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS OF RENT. THE COST OF LIVING AND LIMITED NOTICE OF MILITARY ORDERS TO RELOCATE RESULT IN MILITARY FAMILIES REQUESTING PAY ADVANCES AND EMERGENCY LOANS TO SECURE BASIC NEEDS. A SOLDIER RECENTLY AT CAMP PARKS DISCLOSED THAT HE HAD TO TAKE OUT TO LOANS IN REQUEST TO PAY ADVANCE FOR THE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT HE HAD TO PAY. FOR FIRST MONTH'S RENT AND A SECURITY DEPOSIT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY FAMILY WAS NOTIFIED THAT WE HAD TO RELOCATE AND LESS THAN THREE MONTHS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING IN EL PASO TEXAS WAS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DOLLARS WITH A TWO HUNDRED AND 67% INCREASE TO FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE COST OF LIVING IN THE BAY AREA. HOWEVER THIS INCREASE DID NOT OCCUR FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND ULTIMATELY FORCED ME TO CASH OUT MY RETIREMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF EL PASO. THE PAY FOR THE DIFFERENCE UNTIL THE HOUSING ALLOWANCE WAS ADJUSTED. ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTING BENEFITS FOR RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS IS THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FINANCIAL RISK. THAN ODINARY TENANTS DUE TO THE STEADY INCOME AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO SATISFY FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. MY HUSBAND AND I CURRENTLY HAVE A MILITARY FAMILY RENTING OUR HOME IN TEXAS WHICH TO BE HONEST WAS A SIGNIFICANT RELIEF. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THE FAMILY IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE PAYMENT FOR ENGAGING DESTRUCTION OF OUR PROPERTY WE MERELY SPEAK WITH THE RENTER'S COMMANDER AND WE BEGIN WORKING WITH THE MILITARY. FOR FINANCIAL RECRUITMENT AT THE VALUE OF DEFAULT OR DESTRUCTION IT TRULY REMOVES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BURDEN AND STRESS FROM THE PROPERTY OWNERS. AS YOU CONSIDER SB SIX FORTY FOUR I ASK THAT YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE NATURE OF ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL. AND THE BURDEN THE EXORBITANT SECURITY DEPOSITS HAVE A MILITARY FAMILIES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MUCH APPRECIATED THE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU. INJURE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP FOR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE I GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES WERE GREATLY APPRECIATE SENATORS AUTHORSHIP OF THIS BILL AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HERE I THINK THERE'S A GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON -- JACKSON AND MEMBERS -- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION SB -- SIX FOUR FOUR CURRENTLY THERE TWENTY FOUR STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK -- THAT ALLOW A RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER TO ASK FOR SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY IN ANY AMOUNT THAT THE CHOOSE -- IN SHARP CONTRAST -- CALIFORNIA FEATURES A MORE BALANCED APPROACH CAPPING THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AMOUNT THAT MAY BE COLLECTED BY RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER. THIS LONG STANDING LAUNCHERS THAT TENANTS ARE NOT ASKED TO PAY AN INORDINATE SECURITY DEPOSIT AMOUNT WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT A PROPERTY OWNER HAS ENOUGH OF A DEPOSIT IN PLACE. SHOULD DAMAGE OCCURRED OF THE UNIT. HOWEVER SB SIX FOUR FOUR ALTERS THIS RESTRICTION BY DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AMOUNT THAT MAY BE COLLECTED FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL. E. R. IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO PROVIDE HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL -- AND NOTES AGAIN -- THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL CURRENTLY RECEIVE A MONTHLY NON TAXABLE HOUSING ALLOWANCE KNOWN AS BASIC HOUSING ALLOWANCE OR B. H.. FOR HOUSING EXPENSES IN ADDITION TO THEIR BASE PAY. B. H. IS BASED ON A MEMBERS RANKED DEPENDENCY STATUS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN DUBLIN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE CITY THAT WAS CITED IN THE ANALYSIS. MILITARY PERSONNEL RECEIVE UP TO FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH IN NON TAXABLE HOUSING ASSISTANCE IN ADDITION THEIR BASE PAY. MILITARY PERSONNEL MAY ALSO APPLY FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS ADVANCE PH -- IF THEY NEED ADDITIONAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE WHEN MOVING INTO A NEW RENTAL UNIT. SEE OURS OF COURSE SENSITIVE TO THE HOUSING NEEDS OF OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL BUT IS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT CHANGING LONGSTANDING LAW THAT WOULD FURTHER LIMIT THE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS ABILITY TO RECOUP LOSSES FOR DAMAGE DONE TO UNIT -- THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER MAKING SB SIX FOUR FOR A DISTRICT BILL WITH A SUNSET DATE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF THE BILL IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA -- THE CONSIDERATION OF STATEWIDE APPLICATION. HOWEVER THIS TIME SEE OUR MOST OPPOSE THIS BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THEE ANY OTHER WTNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HI TING IN HEARING NONE WILL BRING THE BILL OF THE ISSUE BACK TO THE DIE IS SENATOR UMBERG -- THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEINGHERE AT THE OUTSET BUT THERE'S SEVERAL COMMITTEES MEETING AT SAME TIME. FIRST OF THE YEAR REPRESENTATION THAT BATES GOES UP TO FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IT IS OFFENSIVE THE THAT'S FORGENERAL OFFICERS IT'S NOT FOR THE NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF MILITARY PERSONNEL. LET ME JUST GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY -- SECONDLY IS IT HERE'S MY CONCERN MY CONCERN IS THAT. BECAUSE ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY OR ANY THE VETERANS OR OTHERS ARE NOT A PROTECTED CLASS THE WHAT LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO DO IS SIMPLY NOT RENT TO MILITARY PERSONNEL THAT'S AN EASY WAY OUT. AND SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACTUALLY PAY MORE. SO IF WE SIMPLY SAY YOU CAN'T PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT DOWN THE SECURITY DEPOSIT WITH THE LANDLORD'S GONNA SAY IS. OKAY THEN I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE. MONTH MONTHLY THE PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN A PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE MOVING FROM MOST PLACES THE COUNTRY TO CALIFORNIA WILL COST OF LIVING COSTS RENT IS. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER YOU KNOW ONE REMEDY IT IN AND OF COURSE WE DON'T CONTROL THE MILITARY. IS. TO SOMEHOW MAKE SURE THAT BE A H. FOLLOWS THE SOLDIER SAILOR MARINE WHATEVER IT MAY BE SO THERE'S NOT A TIME LAG -- AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE THAT IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW BUT I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE IS WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A SITUATION. WHERE LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO DISCRIMINATE I THINK LANDLORDS TODAY LEAST IN OUR AREA IN ORANGE COUNTY? DO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MILITARY PERSONNEL BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE DEPLOYMENTS AND THAT KIND OF THING. SO I'M I AM QUITE CONCERNED THEY WERE GONNA EXACERBATE THAT -- IT THAT THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR -- YES PLEASE IF YOU ARE APPRECIATE THAT YES THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG -- FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL -- OF FEEDBACK AND CERTAINLY DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ACTED A MILITARY IS IT IS AN ISSUE IRRESPECTIVE OF THIS BILL. AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS AND SO. WHEREVER THAT DISCRIMINATION IS OCCURRING WE SHOULD ACTIVELY. TALK ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ENFORCE OUR RULES THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU CANNOT. AND IF THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF IT -- UPON ENACTMENT I THINK IT REQUIRES OUR OUR SPECIAL ATTENTION OKAY I REALLY -- I I I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T. LEAVE BEHIND IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM AND I DO BELIEVE SENATOR UMBERG THERE IS A PROVISION IN HERE AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION PROVISION WITHIN THIS LEGISLATION. SO APPRECIATEYOUR YEAH OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THERE AND DONE THIS I SUSPECT OR OUR FURRY WELL AWARE OF IT -- BUT THERE IS THAT ANTI DISCRIMINATION CLAUSES AND PERHAPS OF THE BILL DOES A MOVE FORWARD THERE CAN BE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THESE SECURITY DEPOSITS AND THE FACT THAT THE MONEY DOESN'T COME IN FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOU TO GET. RE LOCATED I THINK IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WHICH YOU'RE OF COURSE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN YOUR BILL BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT CLAUSE THERE IS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE AND WOOD. SENATOR A WHITE KOWSKI ASKING THE NEXT QUESTION I'LL TRY TO FIND IT FOR YOU. ON TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION WHY NOT JUST SICK EXTEND THESE LOWER A SECURITY DEPOSIT STILL ALL RENTERS YOU KNOW YOU'VE YOU'VE SINGLED OUT IT WITH A A DESIRE TO HELP OUT THE MILITARY FOLKS WHICH BY THE WAY I'M A BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY SO. PEOPLE ON ACTIVE SERVICE TO GET THE FILE BANKRUPTCY YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT MEETING THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS THAT ALL THE OTHERS -- MEMBERS PEOPLE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAS SO WITH THAT ASIDE WHY NOT USE PROPER DOWN TO ONE MONTH -- FOR APARTMENT AND SPREAD THAT TO ALL PEOPLE ARE CHARGING I GET THE OPPOSITION WOULD HATE THAT MORE RIGHT. BUT IT SEEMS MEDIA ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THAT AS A AS A POTENTIAL BENEFITS. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. PLEASE SIR PLEASE PROCEED. AT CENTER WHITE HOUSE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTION. AT THE A SERVICE MEMBER HAS AN OBLIGATION THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CIVILIAN -- AND THE THAT THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE MILITARY CODE WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF CONDUCT WHICH IS ENFORCEABLE IN THE MILITARY NOT IN CIVIL COURT. BUT IN THE MILITARY -- AND THAT IS THEY CAN UP TO LOSING YOUR POSITION IN THE MILITARY FOR A VIOLATION OF THAT CODE IT'S A VERY SERIOUS OBLIGATION -- AND IT'S AN ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATION AND I I'M. FIVE EARLIER UNFORTUNATELY -- FOR A CIVILIAN THERE IS NO SUCH -- ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN PLACE -- THAT MATCHES ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF AN ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEMBERS SO WELL I THINK YOUR POINT IS -- THOUGHTFUL ONE ABOUT HOW WE CAN CARE FOR EVERYONE IN TERMS OF THEIR UNIQUE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ALTHOUGH IT RISKS BEING RESPECTFUL FOR THE THE LIABILITY ISSUE ON THE LANDWARD SIDE -- THIS IS THIS IS A UNIQUE CLASS AND THERE'S AN ENFORCEABLE PROVISION UNDER THIS UNIQUE CLASS THAT WOULD NOT BE IN PLACE FOR CIVILIAN. YEAH I JUST I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THE THE FACT THAT THAT ACTIVE MEMBERS CAN FILE BANKRUPTCY THOSE RIGHTS AND THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SUGGEST THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE TO DRESS APPLICATIONS BECAUSE I'VE HAD COMMANDING OFFICERS. TELL ME IS THE ATTORNEY FOR THESE FOLKS THAT WE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO NOT ANSWER THE LETTERS TO NOT ADDRESS THE DEBT PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THIS IN AN ACCEPTABLE -- A REMEDY WHAT UNDERNEATH THOSE PARAMETERS ARE THE FILE BANKRUPTCY AND TO PAY NOBODY. NOBODY SO WHILE IT IT'S SUGGESTED THAT THEY PAID THEY THEY ADDRESS THE THING I JUST THINK THAT THERE IS. A BENEFIT FOR ALL RENTERS TO REFER ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. EXCEPT TO ALL THESE BENEFITS AND I THINK IT'S A CHERRY SUGGESTED THE TWENTY ONE DAYS IS IS A LONG TIME FOR ANYBODY TO WAIT TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK AFTER THEY'VE CHECKED OFF ALL THE BOXES. ARE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WOULD BE A BRILLIANT BILL. BUT IT MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM A LITTLE BIT BEYOND CHEST THE THE ISSUES HERE IF I COULD TO RESPOND. CENTER I'M BURKE ON PAGE THREE OF THE BILL ALIGNS TWENTY TWO THROUGH. TWENTY SEVEN A LANDLORDS FROM NOT REFUSED TO ENTER INTO A RENTAL AGREEMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WITH A PROSPECTIVE TENANT TO WAS A MILITARY SERVICE MEMBER. BECAUSE THIS PARAGRAPH PROHIBITS THE LANDLORD FROM DEMANDING RECEIVING A GREATER AMOUNT OF SECURITY THAN THAT WHICH IS ESTABLISHED IN PARAGRAPH. ONE AND AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES -- AND AND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE SENATOR ALLENRECITE CHAPTER AND VERSE ALL THE ANALYSES BECAUSE HE IS CORRECT THAT THEY DID. THE HASN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO MEMORIZE THEM BUT AS IS SUGGESTED AS IS SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS UP PERHAPS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD IT JUST SIMPLY PROHIBITS IT BUT THERE IS NO. ACTUAL MECHANISM IN THERE SO CENTER I'M PRODUCING TO HAVE. ANOTHER QUESTION PLEASE GO AHEAD. SO MADAM CHAIR I TAKE YOUR POINT -- IN. I'M NOT SURE -- TO CENTER ALAN'S POINT TO HOW YOU AND FORCE IT BUT BUT WITH THE CAVEAT HERE THAT SAYS. BECAUSE THIS PARAGRAPH PROHIBITS THE LANDLORD FROM DEMANDING RECEIVING GREATER AMOUNT. OF SECURITY YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO STRIKE THAT CLAUSE ANOTHER WORDS YOU JUST CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BASED ON SOMEONE'S MILITARY STATUS SO. IF YOU TAKE OUT BY CLAUSE THERE'S NO NEED TO PROVE THAT THE DISCRIMINATION IT IS A RESULT OF SOMEHOW. BEING REQUIRED PROVIDE AND IN ADDITIONAL SECURITY DEPOSIT. SO. WONDERFUL IDEA AND THERE IS A BILL THAT SENATOR HILL WILL BE PRESENTING TO THIS COMMITTEE SB TWO TWENTY TWO WHICH I BELIEVE ADDRESSES THAT EXACT ISSUE. SO. AS A FOLLOW ON ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT THE AND I KNOW I AM. DEEPLY CONCERNED BECAUSE EXPERIENCES NOT PERSONALLY BUT WITH FOLKS PARTICULARLY IN THE LOWER ENLISTED RANKS -- WHERE THERE IS RAMPANT DISCRIMINATION IN BOTH HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF ONE'S MILITARY STATUS OF SPOUSAL STATUS OF SOMEONE IN THE MILITARY SORT OF IN THE OPPOSITE OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE RIGHT? RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE WE JUST DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU A DOLLAR OR HOUSING -- SO I I I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TO DO BUT I I AM. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL COULD BE MORE DRAMATIC THAN THE THAN THE ACTUAL ISSUE WE'RE TRYING. TO ADDRESS HERE AND I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. THERE'S SOME SORT OF PROVISION THAT THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- A GENERAL OFFICERS NOT ANY PROBLEM MEETING ANY SECURITY DEPOSIT REQUIREMENT. AT A PRIVATE FIRST CLASS MAY WELL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM MEETING THAT KIND OF AN OBLIGATION. SOUL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO TELL YOU WHAT I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE A PROBLEM OF OR AT LEAST EXACERBATE A DEBATE A PROBLEM THAT EXISTS. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG I APPRECIATE THAT. CONCERN AND THE RECOGNITION THAT PERHAPS GOING FORWARD -- THIS THIS ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MILITARY -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE. INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL AND TO APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THAT OBVIOUSLY THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO ASSIST. NOT TO OF SIR BLOCK OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND FOR WHOM WE CLAIM WE CARE DEEPLY -- SO. APPRECIATE THAT AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL COMMIT -- IN YOUR CLOSE TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE. THE SENATOR MONNING AND THEY WILL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND CLOSE. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND I DO APPRECIATE THESE RECENT COMMENTS OF CONCERN OF AN AND INTENDED. CONSEQUENCE OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MILITARY MEMBERS. RED RIGHT UP FRONT WITHOUT IT BEING ARTICULATED. SO I I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO TRYING. TO SOLVE THAT CHALLENGE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- SENATOR -- GLAZER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM SURE THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL REVIEW OF THE BILL I CERTAINLY DIED TO COMMIT TO WORKING WITH CENTER -- BURKE AND THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE OF DISCRIMINATION NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT AND IT'S A IT'S A BROADER PROBLEM THAT MAYBE CAN BE SOLVED OR HELP BY THIS BILL MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WORK ON TOGETHER BUT I'M VERY COMMITTED. TO ADVANCING THAT I WANT TO SEE A COUPLE OF THE THINGS IN MY CLOTHES. AT THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS HAD GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY AND I APPRECIATED THAT THE BILL DOES WORK FOR THEM TODAY BUT IT'S NOT OUT OF A GREAT -- SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT I'VE HAD WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH THEIR ORGANIZATION ABOUT THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE HAD AND MAYBE WE CAN STILL FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AS THE BILL. WAS FOR BY ONE APPRECIATE THE THE COMMITMENT THEY'VE MADE TO OUR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS -- I AM OPEN TO AN ISSUE OF A SUNSET TO MAKE SURE WE THE BILL HAS TO BE WORKING OR ELSE WOULD IT'S NO GOOD SO -- AND WILL THAT'S AN OPTION GOING FORWARD POTENTIALLY -- TO SEE HOW IT WORKS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND EVALUATED I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THAT AND IT MAY BE A REMEDY THAT WE EXPLORE -- I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO KATRINA FOR TELLING HER STORY AND FOR HER SERVICE FOR HER FAMILY -- TO OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU TO RAQUEL VERY REPRESENTATION OF ACTIVE AND VETERANS GROUPS I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU OUR EYES HER MOTION. THE MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE VETERANS AFFAIRS SO THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO FURTHER REVIEW WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS. TO CONSIDERING A ADDITIONAL OPTIONS HERE AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. A MAN SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON BY JACKSON AYE FORGES.

VOTE COUNT IS FOR TWO ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROAD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND WE WILL NOW GO TO FILE ITEM SEVEN BY SENATOR TO RISE SO SB. FOUR NINETY FIVE AND AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO JUST A REMINDER -- WITNESSES TO WITNESSES. MAIN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH -- WE'VE GONE A LITTLE BIT OVER OCCASIONALLY BUT IT WOULD IF WE COULD KEEP IT TO THE TWO MINUTES. AND THAN OTHERS WHO ARE IN SUPPORT WILL STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE GIVE THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION INDICATING SUPPORT. AND THEN WE DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN WITH THE OPPOSITION. SO WITH THAT GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR RUSS I THINK THIS IS YOUR FIRST BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. BEEN HERE BEFORE YES THE FIRST ONE ARE WELL WELCOME THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- A VERY SIMPLE BUT VERY VERY IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. AS THE FOUR NINETY FIVE PROHIBITS TE COURT. FROM CONSIDERING THE SEX EITHER MAN OR WOMAN. GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A PARENT. LEGAL GUARDIAN OR RELATIVE. IN DETERMINING THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRANTING CUSTODY OKAY. IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THIS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY THE QUOTE UNQUOTE BEST INTEREST STANDARD. A BEST INTEREST DETERMINATION IS A HOLISTIC ANALYSIS. IT REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE HEALTH THE SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF A CHILD. THENATURE AND AMOUNT OF CONTACT WITH EACH PARENT AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SEX GENDER EXPRESSION GENDER IDENTITY. OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A PARENT. LEGAL GUARDIAN OR RELATIVE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO LOVE AND CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING CUSTODY -- MEMBERS AND MADAM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES -- HERE TODAY REBEKAH BIRMINGHAM OF LONG BEACH BAR ASSOCIATION AND MANDY TAYLOR OF THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE -- REBEKAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS REMA BIRMINGHAM I PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE LONG BEACH BAR ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT MANY PARENTS IN FAMILY LAW GUARDIANSHIP AN ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS -- THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD IS THE LEGAL STANDARD IN MAKING THESE JUDICIAL. DETERMINATIONS I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO AMEND FAMILY CODE SECTIONS. THIRTY ELEVEN THIRTY TWENTY AND THIRTY FORTY TO MAKE CLEAR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD FACTORS. ARE BIASED FREE. A BEST INTEREST AND ALICE'S COVERS MANY FACTORS THESE INCLUDE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THE HEALTH THE SAFETY THE WELFARE OF A CHILD. THE EMOTIONAL TIES BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD APPEARANCE ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY THE CHILD'S TIES TO THEIR HOME AND THEIR COMMUNITY AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS UNDER. SB FOUR NINETY FIVE THIS WILL NOT CHANGE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS OLD CONTROLLING CASE LAW THAT ALSO PERMITS A COURT TO CONSIDER IRRELEVANT FACTORS SUCH AS THE LGBT Q. STATUS OF A PARENT. THE LEAD CASE REGARDING DON HETEROSEXUAL PARENTS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS MARRIAGE OF BIRDS SOL. WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT EVEN TODAY TO CONSIDER. THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF THE PARENT. APPARENT SEX OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS A RELEVANT TO A BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS IT'S TIME TO CLARIFY THE CASE LAW AND BRING THE LAWN TO CONFORMITY WITH SCIENCE. WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWS THAT HAVINGAN LGBT Q. PARENT DOES NOT HARM A CHILD. THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM CUSTODY DETERMINATION SO THAT EVERY PARENT IS VIEWED EQUALLY. I ALSO KNOW THAT AS DRAFTED THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE THE LAW BIAS FREE WITH RESPECT TO EVERY PARENT. NOT JUST LGBT Q. PARENTS. ELIMINATING THESE -- RELEVANT FACTORS FROM A BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS WILL BENEFIT LITIGANTS MANY OF WHOM ARE PROBE HER. WITH CLEAR AND PLAIN LANGUAGE ON THE FACE OF THE STATUTE IT WILL MOSTLY. BENEFIT CHILDREN BY REDUCING THE ACRIMONY IN CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS. WE ASKED TODAY FOR YOUR VOTE -- TO MOVE SB FOUR NINETY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. HELLO MADAM CHAIR PERCENT AND COMMITTEE MEET MEMBERS MY NAME IS MANDY TAYLOR AND I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB FOUR NINETY FIVE BY IS FREE CHILD CUSTODY. I AM A SOCIAL WORKER AN ADVOCATE A MEMBER OF THE QUEER AND TRANS COMMUNITY AND A PARENT OF AN AMAZING KID. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS AN INFANT I LEFT MY ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND AND FILED FOR FULL CUSTODY TO ENSURE HER SAFETY? FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS I HAVE HAD FULL PHYSICAL CUSTODY AND THE FAMILY COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY ENFORCED SUPERVISED PARENTING TIME FOR MY CO PARENT. OR CHILD SAFETY AND WELL BEING WAS PARAMOUNT TO ME. BECAUSE OF THAT FOR YEARS DURING THE LENGTHY CUSTODY PROCESS I DID NOT FEEL SAFE COMING OUT ABOUT MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. MY EX HAD MADE HIS BELIEFS ABOUT LGBT Q. PEOPLE VERY CLEAR AND I KNEW THAT I CAN EXPECT RETALIATION IF HE KNEW MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I WAS A SINGLE PARENT WITH AN INTENT I HAD NO COLLEGE DEGREE. I WAS IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM TRYING TO DEAL WITH MY TRAUMA. I WAS ON WELFARE AND ATTENDING SCHOOL FULL TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY OR THE TIME AND KNOWLEDGE TO RESEARCH CASE LAW. IF I COULDN'T GUARANTEE AN UNBIASED JUDGE MEDIATOR OR OPPOSING COUNSEL BEING OUT WAS TOO MUCH OF A RISK TO MY DAUGHTER'S SAFETY. I WAITED THREE YEARS TO BE PUBLICLY OUT I WAITED UNTIL I FINISH SCHOOL I WAITED UNTIL I WAS SOLIDLY MIDDLE CLASS. I WAITED UNTIL I CAN AFFORD AN ATTORNEY I WAITED UNTIL I HAD COMMUNITY THAT HELPS ME FEEL SAFE. NO ONE ELSESHOULD HAVE TO WAIT BECAUSE OF FEAR. BY CODIFYING IN CLARIFYING CASE LANDA STATUTE YOU HELP PROTECT CHILDREN BY INSURING THE BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION HAVE NO PLACE WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST INTERESTS OF A CHILD. BY PUTTING THESE PROTECTIONS INTO THE FAMILY CODE YOU REDUCE BARRIERS FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS AND SOME MORE SUPPORT COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING EASIER TO ACCESS PROTECTIONS. ALL CHILDREN DESERVE TO FEEL LOVE. SAFE AND CARED FOR IN THEIR OWN HOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OF MUCH APPRECIATED OTHER WITNESSES PLEASE IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. AYE ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. TAMMY MARTIN WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA SPONSORED THE BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HELLO ROSARIO BRIAN NOR CAL MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA ND THE OUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROJECT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. VIDEO BORN REPRESENTING AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DR DANIEL GILL RELIANCE YEAH -- AND HERE'S THE PROCESS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MERCY GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I KNOW WE DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE HERE IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. CHRISTIAN THAT TESTIMONY -- OF THE WITNESSES PARTICULAR YOUR TESTIMONY IN SHARING YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE -- MY QUESTION GOES. TO HAD IS THE IN OPERATION. HAVE YOU OVERCOME INHERENT BIAS OF A JUDGE NGUYEN. THE JUDGE MAYBE DOESN'T ARTICULATE A BIAS MAYBE I'M DIRECTING THIS TO THE ATTORNEY -- WITNESS. IS THERE ANY MECHANISM THAT WOULD NOT PUT IN FRONT OF A JUDGE CERTAIN. PERSONAL OR FAMILY INFORMATION SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR IS THAT. AVAILABLE TO A JUDGE WHO'S MAKING A DETERMINATION -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. THERE'S AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE. DOES THE ANALYSIS FOR BEST INTEREST. AND IT IS NOT A SECRET WHO'S GAY OR NOT GAY IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. BUT IT'S NOT A CATEGORY THAT THE COURT CAN CONSIDER IS INHERENTLY SUSPECT OR SOMEHOW DEFECTIVE. SO IN THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING THE COURT CAN CERTAINLY HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE OR EVEN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IF IT'S SIGNIFICANT TO THE CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATION. THIS DOESN'T HAMPER THE COURT AT ALL IT JUST CLEANS UP BIRDS ALL. I APPRECIATE IT AND IT GOES FROM -- BISSCHEN TO THE COURT CAN'T CONSIDER -- YES YOUR HONOR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS -- A MAY CONSIDER. THANK BUT WHY. IT THANK YOU AGAIN I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE IN LEAD TO MOVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SENATOR. QUICK QUESTION. I THINK I'M MAYBE ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT CENTER MORNING ASKED [inaudible] BY. I'M QUOTING SAYS IT'S REFERRING TO WAS THE CHIEF IN AND BIRDS ALL. THESE CASE USES THESE CASES WILL GENERALLY PROTECTIVE OF THE RIGHTS OF NON HETEROSEXUAL PARENTS. LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY. THAT HOMOSEXUALITY MAY BE CONSIDERED. A FACTOR. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION. THAT THE LAW. MAY BE LOCATED ELSEWHERE PREVAILING LAW. HAD DONE AWAY WITH THAT AS OF FACTORS THAT. IN MY MISSING SOMETHING -- NOT ALONE SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTION. WE WERE SHOCKED TO FIND THIS LITTLE. HOLE IN THE LONG. IT IS STILL ON THE BOOKS NADLER IS STILL GOOD LAW CHAFIN STILL GOOD LAW OTHER HORRIBLE CASES THEIR OLD CASES. BIRDS DAHLE IS THE LAST TIME ANYBODY HAS SPOKEN ON THIS AT THE THE LAW LEVEL THERE THAT'S CASE LAW. AND IT'S NOT TERRIFIC FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE SO THIS. STATUTE WOULD MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR IN LANGUAGE THAT'S JUST PLAIN. BAD ODD THE SAYS GENDERED HETEROSEXUAL MAN. WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE SAME WAY AS LGBT Q. PARENTS EVERYBODY'S TREATED THE SAME. OKAY BUT WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY ACTIONS WERE COURTS HAVE USE THAT AS A AS A FACTOR IN THEIR DETERMINATION. THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LONG BEACH BAR. LA COUNTY HAS STATISTICALLY ABOUT 31% OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY. TO LITIGATE THESE MATTERS -- MANY DO NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF APPELLATE COURT CASES BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE. THAT PARENTS WILL USE WHAT THEY CAN TO BEAT ON EACH OTHER. IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AND THIS JUST TAKES AWAY SOMETHING THAT ESCALATES -- AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR CHILDREN. INTO AN ACRIMONIOUS EVENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS SITE STARTED PRACTICING LAW AT A POINT IN TIME WE'RE WOMEN WHO -- CAME OUT OR WERE. OUTED AS LESBIANS WERE JUST BY VIRTUE THAT STATUS LOSING THEIR CHILDREN FREQUENTLY TO ABUSIVE. OTHER PARENTS BUT CHOSE THEIR STATUS SO I THINK WE'VE COME A LONG WAY THIS I THINK WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS ISSUE BEFORE US. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE COURTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DO SOME TRAINING ON THIS FOR THE IMPLICIT BIAS THAT DOES. OF THE SADLY CONTINUE TO EXIST IN SOME AREAS. IN THE AREA OF LGBT Q.. L. G. B. T. LGBT Q. PARENTING AND WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO TO CORRECT THAT AND HOPEFULLY. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOMETHING IN THE LEGISLATION GOING FORWARD IF IT SHOULD PASS BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE A MOTION NOW. WHICH IS TO DO PASS. OF THE TO THE SENATE FLOOR -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE FORGES ALAN [inaudible] CABALLERO. MONNING. MONNING EYES STERN. I'M BURKE. NUMBER I WHITE HOUSE. WHITE HOUSE HE AYE ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS -- THREE VOTES AND WE WILL PLACE IT ON CALL. FOR VOTES EXCUSE ME AND WE WILL STILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS SENATOR Y. KOWSKI EUROPE. WE HAVE TWO BILLS LEFT THANK YOU SO SO MUCH SENATOR ROSS SO AND AND WITNESSES APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. WE HAVE TWO BILLS LEFT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI AND THEN I HAVE A BILL TO PRESENT -- IF WE COULD TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ABSENT MEMBERS ARE AWARE THAT WE ARE IN THE LAST TWO BILLS THAT WOULD BE MOST APPRECIATED. ALREADY HE IF WE JUST WAIT TILL THE DOORS CLOSE. PART AND BEFORE WE START I JUST WANT TO MAKE A NOTE THAT -- APOLOGIES THAT THE ANALYSES DID NOT. INCLUDE IN IT VIRTUALLY DID NOT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS. I IT WAS SUBMITTED IN A TIMELY FASHION OF THEIR OPPOSED TO THE BILL AT THE CHEST WAS INADVERTENTLY NOT INCLUDED. SO -- WE I WANTED TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT RIGHT UP FRONT AND CERTAINLY APOLOGIZE FOR THAT ARE. CENTER WERE CASKEY THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST OFF I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR IMPROVING THE BILL WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS. SB THREE TWO THREE WILL STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN CALIFORNIA IS OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE HAVE HEARD A VERY SIMILAR FAILED THE LAST YEAR UNFORTUNATELY. HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION BOARDS A CONTINUE TO MANIPULATE ELECTIONS BY FAILING TO NOTE THAN TO NOTICE AN ELECTION FAILING TO DELIVER BALLOTS ALL RESIDENTS AND THROWING OUT VALID BALLOTS SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD ELECTIONS AT ALL. THIS IS DONE TO EXCLUDE DISENFRANCHISES OTHER RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ASKED TO CHALLENGE THE EXISTING REGIME. H. AWAY BOARDS CAN FIND HOMEOWNERS TAKE THEM TO COURT AND EVEN FOR CLOSE ON THEIR HOMES SO THESE BOARD MEMBERS -- ELECTIONS ARE NO SMALL MATTERS WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS A JUDGE TOM CERTAIN AND MARJORIE MURRAY FROM THE CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. H. AWAY ALONG THE URCHIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITNESSES TWO MINUTES TEACHER IF YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND PROCEDURE HONOR IF YOU'D LIKE. TO START THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION. AND I LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT EVERY PROPOSED PROVISION IN THIS BILL. IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS VERY REAL PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. TO THE CENTERS ATTENTION REPEATEDLY BY HOMEOWNERS. FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE YES WE HAVE SEEN THIS BILL BEFORE. AND THE THERE'S JUST -- ONE INSTANCE I WOULD LIKE TO SINGLE OUT. AND THAT IS THE COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE ABOUT -- HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE BROUGHT A CHALLENGE TO AN ELECTION. OR WHO ARE SEEKING ACCESS TO ASSOCIATION RECORDS AND HAVE BEEN DENIED. AND WHAT THEY TELL US IS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN THEIR CASE TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. AND IN MANY CASES HAVE ACTUALLY WON THE CASE WERE TOLD YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE CORRECT THERE WAS A MISTAKE HERE. AND BUT THE RELIEF PROVIDED. WAS MAYBE THE THE FINE CENTER ASSOCIATE BUT THERE'S NO. I INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THERE'S NO ORDER THAT THE DOCUMENTS BE PRODUCED THERE'S NO ORDER THAT THE ELECTION. BE INVALIDATED. AND SO THAT IS THE REASON WHY THAT ONE PROVISION IS IN THERE TOWARDS THE END WHERE WE TALK ABOUT. SMALL CLAIMS ANOTHER OF JUDICIAL MATTERS THAT MANDATES THE COURT TO INVALIDATE AN ELECTION. IF THERE IS MISCONDUCT. LARA VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE OR THEIR OF RULES HAS BEEN FOUND. ABSENT OF THE ASSOCIATION CARRYING THE BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE MISTAKE WAS ON INTENTIONALLY DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME [inaudible] MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN -- FROM. MANY YEARS ON THE BENCH I'VE BEEN HEARING SMALL CLAIMS CASES. OF FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS I CONTINUE TO DO THAT. A AS A BE A COMMISSIONER FROM SPIRIT COURT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND I ALSO CHAIRED THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS. SUBCOMMITTEE ON SMALL CLAIMS AND LIMITED CASES FOR FIVE YEARS. AND BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THIS MANDATE IS NEEDED [inaudible] IS THAT. SMALL CLAIMS JUDGES ARE NOT USE TO GRANTING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COMMON THE DONE. IN FACT THERE'S A PROHIBITION UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIFIC STATUTE AND OFTENTIMES. THE JUDGE MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE PROVISION BUT THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO GET INTO THAT AREA AND CIVIC. EXCUSE ME THE GUIDANCE THAT THIS MANDATE PROVIDES A IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET ACTUAL RELIEF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TEST BY MARJORIE MARIE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. AND THE FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS EXTREMELY DETAILED ANALYSIS WHICH REALLY LAYS OUT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY -- WE WERE A MEMBER OF THE ORIGINAL WORKING GROUP IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT CRAFTED THE EXISTING LAWS GOVERNING HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS. AND THE TITLE OF THOSE STATUTES WERE FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY IN ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS FOR GOOD REASON. THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH OF ABUSE. SO THAT WAS AN EFFORT TO CLEAN UP ELECTIONS AND I THINK WE HAVE GONE A LONG WAY TOWARDS DOING THAT HOWEVER IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THEY BECAME LAW WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY -- DOCUMENTED TOO MANY ABUSES. REGARDING THE INABILITY OF PEOPLE TO RUN FOR A BOARD SEAT OR EVEN TO GET A BALLOT TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION. SO -- IN MY TESTIMONY I REALLY ONLY WANT TO STRESS ONE POINT. AND THAT IS -- WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE? MAINLY BECAUSE AND I'M HERE I'M KICKING OFF -- A SECTION OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT COUNTRY CLUBS. THEY'RE NOT NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS ARE PUT ON BARBECUES THEY ARE AS THE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE RULED REPEATEDLY. THESE ARE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE POWERS THAT OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES. THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS ANALYSES OF BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE IT PARTICULARLY THE ELECTION BILLS. HAVE ALSO REPEATED THIS THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE QUAYSIDE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WITH EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OVER THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE. HAD I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HOW WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS BELIEF. IT'S A CURIOUS TO US IN FACT IT'S BAFFLING THAT THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE SAME THING. IF YOU LOOK AT MARKETING MATERIALS FROM THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE. IT SAYS THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS ARE DEVELOPED IN OPERATE IN AN INTER GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM COMPOSED OF UNITS OF LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEIR MARKETING MATERIAL SAY THE REASON THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS IS THAT THEY ARE A FORM OF DEMOCRACY. IN WHICH LEADERS ARE ELECTED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS. SO EVEN THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL AGREE WITH US THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE A FORM OF GOVERNMENT. AND THAT THE CODE OF THE ELECTIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTED IN THEM NEED TO REACH THE SAME STANDARDS OF FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY BUT WE EXPECT OF OTHER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY. ASK FO AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE I ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE -- IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AS WE WERE UP IN OPPOSITION SB TWELVE SIXTY FIVE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE GOT BY GOVERNOR BROWN STATING IT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ALL ASSOCIATIONS. AND WE AGREE WITH THAT THERE ARE OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A 54% OF THOSE ARE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE UNITS 70% OR LESS THAN FIFTY UNITS. 53% OF THE ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A BUDGET OF LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEN. SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS. ARE NOT EVEN MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL MANAGERS THERE VOLUNTARY BOARDS THAT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT SO. ARE ONE OF OUR MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL JUST LIKE WITH LAST YEAR'S BILL IS THAT IT'S GOING TO CREATE MORE COMPLEXITY. MORE CONFUSION MORE MISTAKES WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY END UP IN MORE LITIGATION. SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THE POINTS OF THE BILL THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN LAST YEAR MADAM CHAIR YOU YOU RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT AND WE APPRECIATED YOUR STATEMENTS ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF A MEMBER STAYING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR ASSESSMENT AND THAT IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY SOMEONE SIGNS UP TO DO -- BUT THE AMENDMENT AS THEY CAME FOR THE BLL AND IS THERE IN RIGHT NOW JUST ADDRESSES REGULAR ASSESSMENTS. NOT SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS THE BILL ALSO ADDS TO A VERY COMPLEX -- PROCESS OF IN INDEPENDENT. INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE BELIEVE EXISTING LAW ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF OF THE FAILURE TO PAY ASSESSMENTS RIGHT NOW AND SHOULD ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACED IN THIS BILL -- IT ALSO IN INCLUDES THINGS AND WE JUST THINK IN FACT. AREN'T PRACTICAL MORE TIMES THAN NOT PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO RUN FOR THE BOARD OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS WE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND CANDIDATES FOR THESE ASSOCIATION FOR TRUTH NOW THE BILL SAYS. THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE BALLOT EVEN BEING MAILED WE HAVE TO SUBMIT IN SEND OR NOTICE A LIST OF THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE ON THAT. MORE TIMES THAN NOT IN MANY ASSOCIATIONS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CANDIDATES THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE BALLOT SERBIAN MAILED TO HAVE THAT. JUST ONE OR THE POINT JUST TO GO TO THE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. EXISTING LOSSES TABULATIONS ARE TO BE READ IT TO BE. COUNTED IN AN OPEN MEETING. WERE WONDERING WHY THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT THIS BILL WAS STATE THE TABULATIONS HAVE TO BE COUNTED. AT A MEETING IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO ALL MEMBERS FOR AT COMMON AREA PROPERTY OF THE ASSOCIATION. I LIVE IN AN ASSOCIATION SEVENTY TWO FAMILY SINGLE FAMILY IS SEVENTY TWO SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES THE ONLY COMMON AREA PROPERTY WE HAVE ANY ASSOCIATION ARE THE STREETS. SO WE COMMONLY. COUNT THE BALLOTS THAT THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS OKAY WITH DOING. THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IN INSTEAD WOULD REQUIRE OUR ASSOCIATION. HAVE TO GO RENT PROPERTY OFF THE PROPERTY TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF MEETING. THANK YOU BILL JUST DOESN'T FIT ALL THE ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE WILL ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM FREELY ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS. MORE CALMLY NOTICE CA CM. I'M SURE THANK OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO PURCHASE. CCM AGREES THAT FAIR REPRESENTATION IS CRITICAL. TO SUCH A MODEL OF GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THIS MODEL. IT IS ALSO. EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE BASIC KENNEDY QUALIFICATIONS IN PLACE. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS A VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBER DECISIONS ON ALL HOMEOWNERS PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS. AS YOU KNOW EXISTING LAW ALREADY CONTAINS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HOMEOWNER PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ELECTIONS. H. AWAY IS VERY GREATLY. AND APPLYING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS ILL ADVISED. AND THE VERY REASON THIS BILL WAS VETOED ONCE BEFORE CCM UNEQUIVOCALLY REJECTS. ANY ON REASONABLE DOES QUALIFICATIONS. HOWEVER CA SAMPLE LEAVES THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE SITUATION OF AN H. AWAY. WHERE THEY ARE GOVERNED BY VOLUNTEER HOMEOWNERS THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS MODEL OF GOVERNANCE TO WORK? THERE MUST BE PARTICULAR VIGILANCE. WITH RESPECT TO QUALIFIED BOARD MEMBERS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE OWNERS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MADAM CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. THE REASON IS THAT IT JUST POINTED OUT WE REPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD PLEASE NAME AND AFFILIATION. YES A STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION WE SUBMITTED A LETTER IN PERSON ARGUMENTS REFLECTED IN HOUSES AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OUR BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. LET ME START WITH THE QUESTION. OF MY CONCERN LAST YEAR WHICH WAS -- IDENTIFIED WAS THAT -- OF PEOPLE GONNA RUN I THINK THEY NEED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH -- THEIR SSESSMENTS AND YOU DID TAKE THAT AMENDMENT THERE'S A CONCERN THAT IT WAS JUST GENERAL ASSESSMENTS ND NOT. ALL THE ASSESSMENTS ARE AND I SUSPECT YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT SENATOR. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE YOUR TAXES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY YOUR TAXES TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL OR FOR THIS POSITION. YOU CAN BE A SENATOR NOT PAY YOUR TAXES NOT FIRE TAXES SO WE THOUGHT IN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION HEY IF YOUR DELINQUENT THAT'S PART OF YOUR CAMPAIGN THE DID BUT IN ORDER TO TRY. TO REMOVE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION WE WENT AHEAD AND SAID YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR REGULAR ASSESSMENTS THE STUFF THAT YOU DEBTS NORMALLY ASSESSED IT'S THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WHEN YOU GET. THEY COULD BE A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS SHOULD BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT THAT TAKES YEARS THIS POST BE PAID OVER YEARS WE JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS UNFAIR. TO TAKE KICK SOMEBODY OUT OF OF ELIGIBILITY THEY STILL HAVE TO RUN FOR THE ELECTION. THAT'S THE WAY WE THOUGHT TO THE CITED THERE'S YOU KNOW AGAIN IS MY WITNESSES HAVE SAID. THIS IS A SERIES OF YEARS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE TRENCHES WHO HAVE BEEN. NOT INCLUDED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WE DIDN'T JUST MAKE THIS UP. THANK YOU AS SENATOR UMBERG TEACHER OF QUESTIONS THANKS JUST A QUESTION -- AS WHAT FIRST A COMMENT OF ONE OF THE SCARIEST EXPERIENCES OF MY ENTIRE ELECTORAL LIFE WAS WHEN MY WIFE SAID SHE WANT TO RUN FOR THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARD. OF BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGING IT AND AND I APPLAUD YOU. FOR LEAVING THIS CHALLENGING AREA BUT IT AS TO MISTER BROWN'S COMMENT CONCERNING -- THE NOTICE WHERE YOU WHERE THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION IS RECRUITING CANDIDATES HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. WHAT WHAT WHAT? WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOME SORT OF [inaudible] MODIFICATION. WELL JUST IN GENERAL COMMENTS WE HAVE HAD. AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITION LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT THERE'S A NEW PLAYER SO I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE THIRTY DAYS NOTICE BEFORE THE ACTUAL ELECTION ALL HAVE. THE JUDGE. THEY ARE THE ORIGIN OF THAT PROVISION IS THAT WE HAVE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY. SUBMIT THEIR NAME IN NOMINATION AND THEN SOMEHOW DON'T END UP ON THE BALLOT. AND SO ARE OF WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT IS TO HAVE. THIS REQUIREMENT THAT. WHOEVER IS GOING TO BE ON THAT BALLOT MUST BE PUBLICIZED IN ADVANCE SO THAT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS LEFT OFF THE COMPLAIN AND CORRECT. AND THERE'S THE PROVISION IS THAT THE INSPECTOR ELECTIONS IN THIS AND MAKE THAT CORRECTION WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS THAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT ADVANCE. OF KERN HIGH. THAT'S A TOUGH ISSUE -- LET LESLIE -- AS A LITIGATOR FOR A LOW HOW MANY YEARS I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT JUDGES DIDN'T KNOW THE LAW TO THOSE RULED AGAINST ME AND I'M PLEASED THAT YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT HERE TODAY JUDGE THANK YOU. SMART SMART ANSWER -- YES CENTER BORCHERS. I YOUR HONOR -- HI CAN YOU CALL MENTAL FURTHER ON YOUR EARLIER STATEMENTS THAT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS NOT WITHIN. THE TOOLS OF OUR SMALL CLAIMS COURT. IS SO IS THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OR IS IT A CULTURAL ISSUE OR IS IT. A JURISDICTION ISSUE. IT'S IT'S JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATUTE OF THIS. THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT. DOES NOT HAVE INJECTED POWER UNLESS THERE IS A SPECIFIC STATUTE GRANTING THAT AFFORD THE GOT IT ALL RIGHT. IF THERE WERE ISSUES IN THE PAST -- WITH AN H. AWAY. NOTHING WOULD PRECLUDE THAT INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS FROM SEEKING RELIEF IN SUPERIOR COURT. THAT A CORRECT IT'S A MATTER OF ACCESSIBILITY OKAY. SO IN ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU INCENTIVIZE AND ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IS RECOVERY OF ATTORNEYS FEES. YES. AND IS THAT A NEW A NEW CREATION OR IS AL ONCE ALREADY AVAILABLE YES. I'M SORRY. THROUGH THE CHAIR. NEWS HURT WHAT WAS ACT DIRECTED ANY PARTICULAR WITNESS SHE WAS FEW SEEM VERY IMPASSIONED HI. GO AHEAD AND GIVE US YOUR ANSWER THAT. DR. SENATOR JACKSON. NO THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT A NEW PROVISION THAT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL STATUTE FROM -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT. IF A HOMEOWNER CONSULTED WITH AN ATTORNEY TO GET ASSISTANCE TO PREPARE THE PLEA PLEADINGS. BUT THE HOMEOWNER COULD REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT OF THOSE FEES FROM THE COURT AT THE TIME THAT THEY FILED. AT THE TIME THE CASE WAS HEARD. SO THAT IS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT YES RIGHT NOW OKAY -- LASTLY. I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A CHOICE AND THEY CAN BE. CHALLENGING THIS IS THE TO SAY THE LEAST -- I THINK BY AND LARGE I THINK THE THE ADVOCATE ON THE TWO SPOKE -- PROBABLY SPEAKS FOR THE MAJORITY GETTING PEOPLE TO RUN IS NOT ALWAYS EASY BUT YOU DO HAVE THOSE H. AWAY IS THAT. PEOPLE ARE VERY -- VERY EXCITED AND AND PASSION ABOUT THE THEIR COMMUNITIES SO IT CAN BECOME MORE POLITICIZED IN YOU WOULDN'T OTHERWISE -- NORMALLY EXPECT BUT I WANTED TO ASK THE SIR WHAT CASF LIKE OWSKI. YOU'VE BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BE I A AND THE MANAGERS ASSOCIATION IS THERE MORE COMMON GROUND. THAT YOU THINK COULD BE ACHIEVED THAT WOULD REMEDY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY MOVING FORWARD. WALL MADAM CHAIR. I HAVEN'T HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE B. I A I DID NOT GET A PHONE CALL OR ANY NOTICE I SAWTHAT THEY SENT A LETTER TO THE THE CHAIR I SAW IT YESTERDAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FIRST CONVERSATION -- WE'VE GONE BACK AND THE BILL IS SLIGHTLY NARROWER THAN IT WAS LAST -- LAST TERM OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR I TOOK SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO NARROW IT DOWN. THE OPPOSITION IS STILL NOT HAPPY WITH THAT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S A FAIR -- REPRESENTATION OF WHERE WE WERE THE BILL TWELVE SIXTY FIVE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR SO. SO I SUSPECT THAT YOU WILL KEEP WORKING IN THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO TRY TO FIND A COMMON GROUND IN THIS IS AN AREA WERE. CENTER Y. CASKETS FROM WORKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO WHY I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE WITH THAT SENATOR ALLEN. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT I REMEMBER BY THE WAY I I WANTED TO COMMEND THE STAFF ON THE THIS EXCELLENT AND DETAILED ANALYSIS -- YOU KNOW I THIS IS A BILL I'VE ACTUALLY STRUGGLE WITH QUITE A BIT THE I. MEMBER OF H. AWAY AS WELL -- YOU KNOW. IT -- BOLTON REALLY I I GUESS I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL AS THOUGH BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME. BAD ACTORS IN THE MIX AND THEY'RE UNDER QUICKLY ARE. I THEY WERE. THE DAY WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE IN THE WORDS THE GOVERNOR ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE COST STAGE ALWAYS I MEAN I I WOULD BE ANNOYED IF. I LIVE LONGER NATURE WAY BACK IN SANTA MONICA AND YOU KNOW. RUNS WELL AND I GUESS I GUESS I'M I WOULD BE ANNOYED IF TO SEE MY H. O. E. A. FEES GO UP BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES ARE GOING -- TO ARE GOING TO BE A SAY THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH THIS BILL -- THEY'RE GONNA HAVE. TO THAT'S GONNA THEY'RE GONNA CURRENT MORE COSTS AND LIABILITIES AND I AND THAT'S I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT I JUST WONDER WHETHER THERE IS A MORE. INCISIVE WAY OF OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WITHOUT. IMPOSING THIS NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS ON OLLIE TWO WAYS MOST OF WHICH ARE OPERATING. PERFECTLY DECENTLY WITHOUT ANY COMPLAINT. I MEAN I USING THE NUMBERS ONE H. AWAY BOARD -- THAT WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS THE STOMACH RIVER WE TALK ABOUT DEMOCRATIC SAFEGUARDS THAT WE HAVE HERE THERE COSTS WAS THREE DOLLARS PER MEMBER OF THE H. AWAY SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A FAIR. AND REASONABLE COST FOR PEOPLE TO TO PAY TEN ORDER HAVE AGAIN. I'M NOT SAYING ALL FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND H. AWAY SIR BAD AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T SEND OUT THEIR BALLOTS THEY DON'T PROVIDE. NOTICE THEY DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE ELECTIONS BUT IN. THERE ARE PROBLEMS SO THIS IS WHY WE PASS LOSSES THAT WE SET A NEW FLOOR THIS IS THIS IS THE FLOOR THAT YOU MUST -- FOLLOW GET IT. YEAH I KNOW I I GET THAT I GUESS I MEAN THAT I BOUGHT THE THE FOLKS FROM SERVICE YOUR FROM HI CLOCK. THAT YOU'RE FROM CRACK Là LOUIS OKAY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO DRASTICALLY INCREASING CAUSES IN SUPPRESSING VOTER PARTICIPATION WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU WROTE THAT IN YOUR LETTER. THROUGH THE CHAIR THE GERMS EXCUSE ME MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF CAL COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE -- TO SPECIFIC ISSUES -- ONE RIGHT NOW -- A CHOICE ARE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH ELECTION RULES -- AND WITHIN THOSE ELECTION RULES AND WHEN THEY CAN DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A MEMBER. HAS THE BILL AS WRITTEN -- IF WE WERE -- TO ELECT TO ORDER PUT IN OUR PROCESS THAT SOMEONE COULD BE DISQUALIFIED FOR THE FAILURE OF PAY ASSESSMENTS. THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN ONLY DO THAT THROUGH AN AMENDMENT TO OUR BIOS. MEMINTA THE BYLAWS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE YOUR ATTORNEY DO WHICH HAS SOME COST AND THEN. REQUIRES ANOTHER ELECTION AN ELECTION AND HAS TO BE PASSED BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE IN THE BYLAWS SO THAT CHANGE ALONE IF IF YOU HAVE WITHIN YOUR ELECTION RULES. A PROHIBITION MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS IN GOOD STANDING AROUND FOR THE BOARD WOULD NOW HAVE TO BE PUT THROUGH YOUR BY LAWS. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL COSTS WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL STILL ALLOWS FOR THE ELECTION MATERIALS TO BE COPIED. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HAVE A SUPPRESSION ON VOTER PARTICIPATION BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. NOT ONLY TO THE BALLOT STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SIGN ALMOST EVERYONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ELECTION PROCESS FOR AN H. AWAY REQUIRES YOU. WHEN YOU GET YOUR MATERIALS YOU PUT A? YOU SEE YOU MARK YOUR BALLOT. YOU PUT THAT IN AN ENVELOPE SEALED THAT ENVELOPE. PUT THAT IN A NOTHER ENVELOPE TO WHICH YOU SIGN. AND SO WHILE WE MADE AN ISSUE LAST YEAR DEALING THAT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY STATED. THAT ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS COULD BE COPIED. AMENDMENT WAS MADE TO MAKE THOSE PART OF THE ELECTION MATERIAL OR MAKE THOSE PART OF THE ASSOCIATION RECORDS. AND THEN IT HAS WORDS IN THE BEGINNING OF IT SAYS EXCEPT FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE. THE SIGN BALLOT DESIGNED ENVELOPES. CAN BE COPIED. SO WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THEIR BALLOTS IN THEIR SIGNATURES CAN BE COPIED AND IN SMALL COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU CAN PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER WILL ONLY CREATE MORE DISTRUST. AND RESULT IN IT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECTION. THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I'M SORRY CENTER OUR ROOM TO DO THAT YOU'RE I MEAN THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A STRETCH RIGHT IN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD INVOLVE. GOV FRAUD THAT WOULD BE PROSECUTABLE AND VERY PRETTY CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE LAW. TO TO PORTUGAL SIGNATURES AND IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THEY DON'T I AM I MISSING YOUR THAT WE ARE SUGGESTING SIR TO THIS YEAR. WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS BUT I'M SORRY I WASN'T WHAT EXAGGERATE WHY DON'T YOU CLARIFY VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD. BECAUSE THAT IS SO THAT'S IF THAT WERE THE CASE THAT WOULD BE OF CONCERN. WE BELIEVE THAT JUST THE FACT OF PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THAT THEIR SIGNATURES COULD BE COPIED -- I UNDERSTAND. AND PEOPLE'S CONCERN. PRIVACY MATTERS EXCEPT FOR THAT THAT WOULD RESULT IN FEWER PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN AN ELECTION SO. IF WE MAY BE PERHAPS HAVE THE SENATOR Y. KOWSKI RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS IN HIS CLOTHES. I WOULD LOVE TO WE THINK WE FIX THE PROBLEM WE SAID THE COULDN'T COPY THIS SIGNATURES THE ELECTION MATERIALS WOULD BE DIFFERENT. TYPICALLY THEY'RE PUT ON THE WEBSITE SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT. THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT THE GOING TO DO WITH THAT BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IF. WE THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE IS ENOUGH TO SAY YOU CAN'T COPY THE SIGNATURES SO THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT PEOPLE MAY HAPPEN THAT -- THE MADAM CHAIR. I WISH NOBODY A VETO MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR TO SAYS ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE PUT INTO IT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH. DEMOCRACY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN ONE IN FOR CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN THE HOMEOWNERS IS A CESSATION SO I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE THAT A ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVING PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION NOT BEING LEFT OUT FROM MAKING DECISIONS ON WHERE THEY LIVE THERE'S AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THESE ASSOCIATIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE JUST. CUT OUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE RULES THE COUNTRY CLUB FOLKS SAY THESE ARE THE RULES AND WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW YOU TO PARTICIPATE SO ON BEHALF OF THOSE ONE IN FOR CALIFORNIANS. TO LIVE IN THE H. WAYS OUR REGION I VOTE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AND AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS A VERY TOUGH ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT. MANY OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE WELL RUN AND THEY REPRESENT AND AND REFLECT DEMOCRACY. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE RUN LIKE LITTLE FIEFDOMS AND THOSE ARE THE ONES. THAT -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT A AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS SO WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS I WOULD CERTAINLY -- SUGGEST THAT WE ALLOW YOU TO KEEP KEEP. KEEP THE FIGHT OUT THERE BECAUSE IT IS A IT IS YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE VERY VERY ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMMEDIATE. REFLECTION OF THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES. AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY CALLS FOR SO WITH THAT -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVE BY SENATOR MINING THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE HOUSING SO THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE. UNDER DISCUSSION IN THAT COMMITTEE -- IF THE COMMITTEES -- DECIDES. TO CONTINUE ITS PROGRESS AND WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE A BORDERS [inaudible] ALAN. ALLEN I CABALLERO. MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. UMBERG UMBERG BY WHITE HOUSE SKI BY KELSEY AYE RIGHT YOU HAVE OF FIVE VOTES THE WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THERE'S ONE MORE ITEM -- WHICH IS MY MEASURE. OF FILE ITEM. FILE ITEM. THREE SB ONE SEVENTY ONE AND THE GAVEL. THOSE TO MISTER VICE CHAIR YEAH [inaudible] RIGHT IN THESE ARE BACK TO BACK. INITIALLY SAYS INTEREST. SOMEONE [inaudible] I THANK. OKAY SO LOOKS LIKE WE ARE MOVING ON TO SB. ONE SEVEN ONE BY SENATOR -- HANNAH BETH JACKSON -- SENATOR -- COUPLE OF PRELIMINARY. ITEMS -- DO YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT SET FORTH IN COMMENTS SEVEN ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TAKEN THIS AMENDMENT YES AND SO WITH THAT -- OF I WILL ACCEPTANCE IN AUTHORS AMENDMENT. THE COMMENT AND NUMBER SEVEN I BELIEVE THAT ALSO INCLUDES THOSE AMENDMENTS INCLUDE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU AGREE TO TAKING CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL IN THE SENATE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY ALL ADOPTED INTO THE BILL AND I AM ACCEPTING THEM AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU WITH THAT BEING SAID THE THE CHAIR OR THE TO ME THE FLOORS ALL YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY'S EQUAL PAY DAY. IT'S THE DAY THAT REPRESENTS HOW FAR INTO THE NEXT YEAR. WOMEN MUST WORK. TO EARN WHAT MEN DID THE PRIOR YEAR SO ESSENTIALLY. WHITE WOMEN IN PARTICULAR HAVE WORKED THREE MONTHS TO RAGE THE PAY THAT. MEN HAVE RECEIVED AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SO I THINK IT'S FITTING WE'RE HERE TODAY FOR THE PRESENTATION OF A BILL THE CLOTHES THAT WAGE GAP. THIS IS -- THE WAGE GAP RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN LOST WAGES FOR WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. SO. THINK ABOUT THAT NUMBER SEVENTY EIGHT ACTUALLY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. CLEARLY THE WAGE GAP HURTS WOMEN pECONOMY. AND AGAIN THAT IS WHITE WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR FARE EVEN WORSE FOR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN SHE HAS TO WORK TILL AUGUST TWENTY SECOND. TO MAKE WHAT WHITE MEN HAD MADE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AND FOR LATINOS. THEY WORK UNTIL NOVEMBER. TO MAKE WHAT. MEN HAD MADE IN THE PRIOR YEAR -- AS AS HAS MENTIONED -- I'M ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS -- SPECIFICALLY THEY WILL CLARIFY THAT THE SUBMISSION OF THE FEDERAL E. O. ONE REPORT. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL. SO LONG AS SAID EO ONE REPORT CONTAINS THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DATA. THAT IS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL AND THE OBAMA -- FORM WHICH IS THE BASIS OF THIS BILL DOES IN FACT DO THAT -- IT'S ALSO ADDS WE HAD A CLARIFYING AMENDMENT REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF EMPLOYER. AS WELL AS SOME OTHER TECHNICAL CHANGES. THIS MEASURE IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH INFORMATION. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES WE CANNOT FIX WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW. THIS MEASURE REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. BY RACE. BY ETHNICITY AND BY JOB CATEGORY. THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD. FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION IN OTHER WORDS PUTTING A MIRROR IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES. BECAUSE I SUBMIT THAT MOST EMPLOYERS. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING AND DO NOT INTEND TO DISCRIMINATE I CANNOT IMAGINE AN EMPLOYER WAKING UP IN THE MORNING SAYING. GOODNESS THIS MORNING I WANT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN'S PAY. BUT THERE IS IMPLICIT BIAS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO IDENTIFY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL CALLS. FOR AND THE SECOND IS TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO GATHER IMPORTANT DATA. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES IN JOB CATEGORIES. JOB CATEGORIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR IT DOESN'T PINPOINT -- EMPLOYEE A VERSUS EMPLOYEE BE. IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID EQUALLY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK WHAT IT DOES IS IT LOOKS IN VARIOUS JOB CTEGORIES. SUCH AS A ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. SUCH AS MIDDLE MANAGER AND IF IT SEES THAT EMITTED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS ARE AND THAT THEY ARE IN THE LOWER PAYING JOB CATEGORY IT WILL HELP THEM RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON VARIOUS CATEGORIES. SO IF THEY NOTICE DEVIATIONS OR ALL LIARS IN ONE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE ONLY ARE WOMEN. THAT'S AN OUT LIAR AND IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DIG DEEPER INTO WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS -- DISCRIMINATION GOING ON IN THAT PARTICULAR -- UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION GOING ON IN WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS SO. THE BILL IS MODELED CLOSELY AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. RECOGNIZING THAT UNEQUAL PAY IS OFTEN HIDDEN. TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AS I'VE MENTIONED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED REVISION TO A DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS. THE EO ONE FORM. HAS BEEN IN USE FOR FIFTY YEARS THIS IS NOT A NEW FORM. BUT WHAT WE WILL DO IS SIMPLY AT INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY DATA. BY RACE AND GENDER BEGINNING. IN -- THE INTENT OF THE BILL ACTUALLY FEDERALLY WAS TO BEGIN IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO -- OFFICE IT SIMPLY RENEGED ON THIS PROPOSAL NOW THIS WAS A THIS WAS A FORM THAT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS IN THE MAKING STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A FORM WHICH SIMPLY ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY. WHETHER IN WHY AND HOW GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION WAGE DISCRIMINATION WAS TAKING PLACE AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS BECAUSE WOMEN ARE MAKING LESS. THAN MALE COUNTERPARTS SO AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE BILL WAS PULLED. IT THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER SHOOT. ARGUING THAT THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET LACK COULD CAUSE TO STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MEASURE. THIS MONTH THIS PAST MONTH I SHOULD SAY A FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH COLLECTING THIS IMPORTANT DATA. CITING THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION STUDY AN IMPORT THE WENT INTO THE CREATION OF THIS DATA REVISION. AND DECLARING THAT THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET'S DECISION TO HALT THE PROGRAM WAS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE DECISION COULD BE APPEALED BUT NOT NONE THE LESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THE COLLECTION OF THE IDENTICAL PAY DATA REQUESTED UNDER THIS BILL IS NOW UNDER WAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THIS MEASURE INSURERS THE DATA. IS ALSO IN THE HANDS OF OUR STATE AGENCIES I THINK -- IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT YESTERDAY I WAS HONORED TO PARTICIPATE IN A PRESS EVENT -- FOR EQUAL A PAY DAY WITH THE FIRST PARTNER THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE THIRTEEN COMPANIES. LARGE COMPANIES ANNOUNCED THEY WERE PLEDGING TO DO THEIR OWN ANNUAL -- COMPANY WIDE TO PAY ANALYSIS. AND EIGHTEEN T. -- BEING BE A NUMBER OF LARGE COMPANY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. WE WANT TO LOOK TO SEE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT DISCRIMINATING BUT WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IF WE ARE THEN WE WANT TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM. SO -- I AM DELIGHTED AND COMMEND THESE COMPANIES FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP BUT WE NEED THE SELF EVALUATION AND SELF CORRECTION TO BE SYSTEMIC. IF WE HOPE TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP ONCE AND FOR ALL THERE ARE ESTIMATES THAT SAY IF WE DON'T START DOING THIS PRO ACTIVELY. IT'S GOING TO BE A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE WE END UP WITH EQUAL PAY THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE -- SO. THE I LET ME JUST TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT IS OUT THERE TO KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING. IT WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESS TO THE PUBLIC NOR WILL IT EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. I'VE TAKEN -- AN UNUSUAL STEP FOR ME -- AND PROHIBITED -- ACCESS THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS ACT DISCLOSURE THE GOAL HERE IS TO CORRECT NOT TO SHAME. AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT CRITERIA. THE LIMITING A PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORTS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE HAD NO ISSUES WITH ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA FOR THE FIFTY YEARS THAT IT HAS BEEN -- REQUIRED CENSUS FORM HAS BEEN REQUIRED THE DATA WILL PROVIDE A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW ONE PAY DISPARITIES IN OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION BUT IT DOESN'T GO DEEP IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMPARE ONE PERSON'S SALARY VERSUS ANOTHER. WE HAVE THE FAIR PAY ACT WHICH WILL LOOK AT THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK TO IDENTIFY WHETHER PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID THIS LOOKS A JOB CATEGORIES. AND INCENTIVIZE HIS COMPANIES TO CORRECT ANY KIND OF JOB A GENDER DISCRIMINATION THAT EXISTS IN OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES -- SO WITH THAT -- HI THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO TRUST SIMPLY IDENTIFY WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE HAVE GONE ASTRAY -- AND TO CORRECTED AND TO DO SO IN A WAY -- HOPEFULLY WHERE COMPANIES WILL VLUNTARILY MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS WE DO HAVE THIRTEEN COMPANIES THAT ALREADY STEPPED UP. TO DO THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE -- REPLICATED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S LEFT ON THE TABLE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY FOR THE GOODS IN THE SERVICES THAT FAMILIES NEED. FOR THEIR FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND TO HELP CONTINUE KEEPING OUR ECONOMY GOING. SO WITH THAT I HAD TO WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IF -- TO MEMBERS OR THAN TO GUESS COULD TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. I THANK YOU MISTER VICE COULD PLEASE KEEP IT TOO IS A BE WONDERFUL -- MEMBERS AMERICA YOUR SHE HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF SB. ONE SEVENTY ONE I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE A NO THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THESE REPORTS ARE GOING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE EQUAL PACKED VIOLATIONS WOULD REALLY NOT EXIST BECAUSE IT WON'T ALLOW. THESE REPORTS ONE ALLOW FOR THOSE BONA FIDE FACTORS THAT COULD JUSTIFY. A WAGE DISPARITY BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAY DISCRIMINATION REALLY IS NOT JUST ABOUT COMPARING EMPLOYEE A WHO IS A WOMAN VERSES EMPLOYEE BE WHO'S A MAN. DOING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THIS ISSUE OF OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND HOW OTHERS HIRING PRACTICES AND PATTERNS THAT RESULT IN WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SYSTEMICALLY BEING PAID LESS OVERALL OR BEING OVER REPRESENTED OVER CONCENTRATED AND LOWER LOWER PAID JOBS -- SO WE'VE ALREADY SEEN COMPANIES LIKE SALES FORCE THE GAPS STARBUCKS DO THESE PAY AUDITS VOLUNTARILY AND IT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WAYS JUST DISTRIBUTIONS ARE WHAT THE WAGE PATTERNS ARE. AND AND FIGURE OUT OUR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING. OVERLY REPRESENTED IN THESE LOWER PAID JOBS AND 80% OF ALL WAGES ARE GOING TO A HANDFUL OF WHITE MEN. AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S AN EQUAL PAY VIOLATION NOT NECESSARILY BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THOSE COMPANIES SHOULD BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE RECRUITMENT ARE HIRING THE PROMOTION PRACTICES. TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHY IT THOSE PATTERNS EXIST AND WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER -- THREE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK THE DAY AFTER EQUAL PAYDAY -- THERE WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FEMALE ATTORNEYS WHO SETTLED ONE OF THE LARGEST PAY DISCRIMINATION CASES AGAINST FARMERS INSURANCE. AND FARMERS INSURANCE USED A PAY GRADING SYSTEM WHERE THE ATTORNEYS MADE BETWEEN GRADE THIRTY SIX AND FORTY AND IN THROUGH THIS LITIGATION THEY TOOK A THEY WERE ABLE TO GO HIGHER LEVEL LOOK AT THIS PAY DATA AND THEY FOUND THAT. MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO CAME IN CAME IN AT GREAT THIRTY SIX MOST OF THE MEN THAT CAME IN CAME IN AT GREAT. THIRTY SEVEN THAT WOMEN WERE NINE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE IN A LOWER PAY GRADE TO THE MEN AND THAT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE THAT THE PAY GRADE ITSELF WOMEN WERE. DISPROPORTIONATELY AT THE BOTTOM AND OF THE PAY GRADE AND MEN WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT THE TOP AND SO THAT'S THE KIND OF HIGH LEVEL PAY DATA THAT THESE REPORTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. JUST THE OTHER THING THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT TRENDS WITHIN AND ACROSS INDUSTRIES SO HOW DO WAY AGE PATTERNS IN THE TECH SECTOR COMPARED TO WAGE PATTERNS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. WHO HOLDS THE HIGHEST PAYING JOBS WHO HOLDS THE LOWEST PAYING JOBS WHICH WILL ALLOW US? TO CREATE SOME POTENTIAL POLICY INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF BROADER OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION'S WHERE THEY MAY EXIST. THAT WE THINK THAT AGAIN YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE AND SO WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON SHANNON SMITH CROWLEY REVERSING THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN OF CALIFORNIA. WILL TRY AND KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF -- IN TODAY'S EQUAL PAY DAY AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN HAS A LOT OF DATA AND A LOT OF THE VETERANS HERE HAVE HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE. BUT WHEN NUMBER WE DON'T TALK QUITE A BIT AS MUCH ABOUT IS THAT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW MUCH. OF THE PAY DISPARITY IS TO OUTRIGHT BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION. AND AS THE SENATOR SAID THERE'S PROBABLY NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING SAFE. DAMMIT I'M GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN TODAY. IT'S 6212%. SO THAT'S 8294% OF EMPLOYERS AREN'T INTENDING. TO DISCRIMINATE IT LIKELY IS PERPETUATION OF STATUS QUO. BECAUSE WE HAVE LOOKED AT THINGS LET ME GIVE YOU A REALLY BRIEF ANALOGY IN TERMS OF THE POWER OF DATA MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT. THE NUMBERS OF MATERNAL DEATHS. AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IN CALIFORNIA REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MATERNAL DEATHS BY MORE THAN HALF. IN A HANDFUL OF YEARS BECAUSE OF DATA. WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE FOUND OUT HEMORRHAGE PROTOCOL IN PLACE. THAT WAS NUMBER ONE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IT'S NOW NUMBER. THREE WE'RE SIX OUT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN DIE IN CHILDBIRTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE US IS ABOUT 25% THAT'S BECAUSE WE MADE THE DECISION. TO USE DATA TO LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE A VERY MINIMAL IMPACT FOR EMPLOYERS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY TOOK GREAT CARE TO LOOK AT WHAT IT WAS GOING. TO TAKE FOR EMPLOYERS TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND I BELIEVE I MIGHT BE A FEW CENTS OFF BELIEVE BELIEVE IT'S AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS. FOR EMPLOYER. ADD THIS VALUABLE DATA THIS COMBINED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT JUST CAME OUT YESTERDAY. THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS PROVIDING EVERYONE THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE EXAMINED IS WHAT WE NEED SO THAT IT IS NOT A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS BEFORE WE CLOSE THE GAP. WE ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO WE HAVE ANY -- MET ANY -- FOLKS HERE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND STATE YOUR AFFILIATION I ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. JUST BARTOLO WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. WHICH DUGGAR CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. KAPANEN'S GO FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY -- OPPOSITION IN THE RECORD. IF YOU COULD PLEASE THE YES. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MORE CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE SEVEN ONE AGAIN THIS IS SIMILAR. TO A MISTER AS SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL FROM LAST YEAR -- AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AS SHE IS KEPT IN THE BILL THAT WERE NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHY WERE IN A STILL IN OPPOSITION -- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT TO THEIR THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION IN AGGREGATE FORM HOWEVER AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS STILL CONCERNING TO S. OF ONE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DID SUPPORT THE EQUAL PAY ACT WHEN IT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND WE DO A A SUPPORT THE IN A WEEK WILL PAY IN GENERAL AND THAT IS UNLAWFUL AND WHEN THERE IS UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY. AND WHILE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO COLLECT AGGREGATE DATA THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS TO ACTUALLY COMPARE JOBS IT'S A JOBS. THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER RATHER THAN SIMPLY CATEGORICAL JOB TITLES AND SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE WAGE DISPARITY YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOMEONE THAT HAS BEEN WITH YOUR COMPANY FOR THIRTY YEARS. MORE PAY VERSUS SOMEONE THAT HAS ONLY BEEN THERE FOR TWO WEEKS AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THAT ADDITIONALLY THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE PLEDGED TO DO THIS HAVE DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN. AND THAT'S PART OF THE EQUAL PAY ACT THAT'S CURRENTLY THE LOSS OF COMPANIES ARE TAKING A DEEP DIVE THEY ARE TAKING A LOOK ATTHEIR CURRENT PAY PRACTICES WE WANT THAT TO CONTINUE BUT WHY NOT INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO DO THAT. THIS IS THEIR INFORMATION THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION IT'S NOT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE YOU YOU CAN'T KNOW UNTIL YOU FARM AND WHAT YOU DON'T SEE. IT'S THEIR INFORMATION SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT THEY CAN DO THAT AND SO CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS OR THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE NOW REINSTATED THE EO ONE PAID AT A REQUIREMENT WE ARE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT WILL BE APPEALED HOWEVER IF IT'S NOT. THEN THAT INFORMATION SHOULD GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH DOES HAVE DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS AND DIFFERENT STANDARDS AGAIN THIS IS A NEW NATIONAL POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AGREED UPON TODAY TO BE TAKEN. THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WHICH MEANS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT COULD MAKE -- INTERPRET THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS INTERPRET THIS BILL TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE E. A ONE REPORT ITSELF THE YOU COULD HAVE TO STILL COMPLY WITH TWO DIFFERENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON CALIFORNIA LAW AND THEN BASED ON FEDERAL LAW AND FINALLY OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS BILL IS PREMATURE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE PAY EQUITY TAX FORCES NOT COME OUT WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS POINT AND SO FOR THAT. PURPOSE WE FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE -- PENDING DEPENDING ON WHAT THE EO ONE POLICY ADD TURNS OUT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THEN ALSO DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT REPORT SAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE TIME. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN MADAM CHAIR SORT OF MY BACK TO YOU. A CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF COUNTY -- AND CALIFORNIA BUILDS ASSOCIATION WE WORK DILIGENTLY WITH. CENTER JACKSON SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON THE ADOPTION OF SENATE BILL -- THREE FIFTY EIGHT I WON'T BELABOR THE POINTS THAT MISS CURTIS MAY BUT I'D LIKE TO ADD. SOMETHING -- THE AUTHOR NOTED THAT THIS BILL IS PATTERNED AFTER THE FEDERAL LAW AND NOTED THAT. DESPITE HER DEEP CONCERNS WITH TAKING THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- EXEMPTION OF LANGUAGE THAT -- THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY PROBLEMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT I WOULD YOU KNOW THEN WE HAVE VERGE. ADOPTION OF AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTED IN THE PRIOR POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE -- THAT PATTERNS FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS THAT IF ANYONE -- DISCLOSES THE INFORMATION AT THE EEOC. THAT IS SUBJECT TO A MISDEMEANOR AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY. OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE DID SUGGEST SIMILAR LANGUAGE FOR A VIOLATION AND THE ONLY A FINE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT LANGUAGE INSERTED. AND IS MISS CURTIS NOTED IN THE SUBDIVISION AFT LANGUAGE WE'D LIKE IT A LITTLE TIGHTER AND TO BE DEEMED. TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SO LITTLE STRONGER LANGUAGE THAN THAT WHICH IS NOTED IN YOUR COMMENTS SEVEN ON PAGE ELEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE INTERESTED PARTIES -- WISHING TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION OF THIS ITEM PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. IT'S YOUR TURN MEMBERS MICHAEL LOAD ON BEHALF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN A POST. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW ON WITH WESTERN GROWERS ALSO OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO HERE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK SAYING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE FLOOR -- I THINK I'LL START OFF WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND CERTAINLY GO AROUND THE ROOM. WE HEARD FROM -- ONE OF THE PRESENTERS THAT THIS IS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL -- OF PRACTICE IN PLACE -- IS THERE AN ISSUE HERE BUDGET SIMPLY MIRRORING THAT. IS THERE ANY CONCERN ABOUT MAKING AN IDENTICAL ARE NEAR IDENTICAL. WELL THE THE FORM THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE SAME FORM THAT THEY'RE USING ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN OUR LEGISLATION. MAKES IT CLEAR THAT -- SO LONG AS THE FEDERAL. REGULATIONS CONTINUE AS THEY EXIST THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE USING THAT FEDERAL FORM. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO PREDICT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE FORM THAT THEY'RE USING IS OF THE IS IS ONE THAT. IS DESIGNED TO GET TO THE PROBLEMS. THAT EXIST NATIONALLY AND CERTAINLY EXISTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO USE THAT FORM THAT WAS YEARS IN THE MAKING. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST THROWN TOGETHER -- ENDED IT WILL AGAIN COSTS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR COMPANY AND THESE ARE COMPANIES OF MORE A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES SO. FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IS PROBABLY LUNCH FOR ONE OR TWO OF THE EXECUTIVES HIGHER ETHICAL RESERVE MY QUESTIONS OF FOR AFTER SENATOR UMBERG DID YOU WISH TO COMMENT. THANK YOU -- BUT MANAGER WHO. WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL DATA IT'S IDENTIFIABLE BY EITHER COMPANY OR OR PERSON? SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU PROVIDE THE FORM SOMEBODY. OR SOME MACHINE SEIZE THE ACTUAL FORM BY COMPANY. WHO IS THAT IS WHO IS THAT AND WHO ELSE BESIDES THE RECIPIENT HAS ACCESS? IT'S ONLY GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FROM WOMEN HOUSING SO IT WOULD JUST BE A A STAFF. PERSON FOR YOU IF THE AGE OKAY SO THAT PERSON THEN. PUTS IT INTO SOME DATABASE RIGHT. BY DESPITE CATEGORY IS IT IS IT THEN I'VE LEARNED A NEW WORD HERE PSEUDONYMOUS IS IT CAN YOU IDENTIFY CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE COMPANY ONCE IT'S INPUT INTO SOME DATABASE. THE BILL ITSELF DOESN'T GO THROUGH THAT NEXT STEP OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER COLLECTING BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST. THE FOCUS IS ON ACTUALLY HAVING THE COMPANY'S COMPILE THE DATA AND LOOK AT THE DATA THEMSELVES. SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE TO THAT NEXT STEP IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DIP DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF CREATING REPORTS AGGREGATING DATA. BUT REALLY IT'S LOOKING LOOKING AT THE REPORT ITSELF AND JUST SEEING WHETHER THERE ARE PATTERNS THAT WARRANT. FURTHER SCRUTINY. AND IF IT IF THEY SEE I'M SORRY VENTURETHE THE THE INITIAL COMPILATION IS GOING TO BE SECTOR WIDE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT IDENTIFYING A PARTICULAR COMPANY. THE FIRST MEASURE IS TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTORS WHERE. WE SEE A GREATER DISCRIMINATION AN OCCUPATION -- AND AND THEN -- YOU KNOW KIND OF GO FROM THERE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THE YOU KNOW THOSE DISPARITIES AND TRY -- TO GET COMPLIANCE -- BUT THERE'S NO. SORT OF MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT IS GOING TO BE IMPOSED -- AS WE TRY TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE WHERE THE GREATER DISPARITIES ARE. IS EXCESSIVE BOWL BY LITIGANTS SO FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE FILES A FEE HOW CLAIM IT IS AN INFORMATIONAL INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE BY LITIGANTS. AT THIS POINT THE ONLY LITIGANTS ARE FISHHAWK REMEMBER WITH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. PAGES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PAY DISCRIMINATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. JOB SEGREGATION THEY'RE DIFFERENT ISSUES WHICH I KNOW THE CHAMBER KEEPS TRYING TO CONFLATE. BUT THE EQUAL PAY LAW IS VERY DIFFERENT IT COMPARES AND ONE EMPLOYEE VERSUS ANOTHER BASED UPON THE SAME OR SIMILAR -- A JOB OF RESPONSIBILITIES -- THIS LOOKS AT MAJOR CATEGORIES SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS IS THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL WE'RE NOT DOWN AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL BUT BUT BUT FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY FILE A CLAIM ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ALLEGING. DISCRIMINATION PAY OR STATUS WHATEVER IT MAY BE CAN I GET ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BY COMPANY. SO. ALL RIGHT SO I SAID THE GRANITE OR HOW DO I GET THAT INFORMATION IT WOULD AND THESE ARE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAD LAST YEAR WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL THAT THE NORMAL RULES OF DISCOVERY DO APPLY SO AND THESE EO ONE REPORTS. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF BEING REVISED BUT HAVE FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS PROVIDED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND THOSE A YEAR ONE REPORTS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERABLE ALREADY FOR DECADES NOW. SO IT WOULD JUST FOLLOW THE THE SAME RULES AS AS IT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES THAT IT WOULD BE DISCOVER DISCOVER BLUES DOESN'T ADD ANY NEW LEVEL OF ACCESSIBILITY. ALL RIGHT WELL IT DOESN'T APPLY TO PUBLIC ENTITIES RIGHT ONLY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THERE ARE. AT THE END ONLY FOR PROFIT ARE ALSO NOT FOR PROFIT. IT DOES NOT. NO IT DOESN'T SPECIFY COMPANIES ONE HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES AGAIN. AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT THE THE THE REAL PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO GET THE COMPANY TO DO A SELF EVALUATION AND TO CORRECT. AT THAT POINT TIME IF AT AND THEN TO PROVIDE THE DATA. IF A COMPANY SELF EVALUATION CORRECTS WERE DONE. IF IN LOOKING AT THIS THERE ARE SECTORS WHERE THERE IS REAL SUBSTANTIAL DISCRIMINATION. THE AT THE D. FBIHAT LEAST AS WE ENVISION IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER TO FIND OUT WHY. AND AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THERE COULD BE ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY GOOD REASONS -- THAT THE EMPLOYEE THAT TAT THAT THAT IT'S COMPANIES BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE EIGHT THIRTY YEARS. AND THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVEN'T EXPANDED SO THE SAME EMPLOYEES OF THEIR THEY TEND. TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE MALE -- AND THAT WHEN THEY BRING IN NEW EMPLOYEES SHOULD SAY THEY BRING IN SOME FEMALE EMPLOYEES BUT BECAUSE THE MALE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE AT CETERA WHICH ARE ALL LEGITIMATE. BASIS UPON WHICH PAY CAN BE DISPARATE. THEN YOU'RE DONE THERE AS WELL. BUT IF THEY'RE IF AS THEY LOOK AT THIS THEY DISCOVERED THAT. SAID THERE IS SEVERE DISCRIMINATION HI AND PEOPLE ARE WHITE MEN AND ARE BEING PAID MORE AND THE WOMEN ARE IN THE LOWER PAYING JOBS AT BIG SUR QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO TRY. TO REDUCE THAT DISPARITY. HIRE MORE PEOPLE PROMOTE THEM IT AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO GET. TO CLOSE THE GAP NOT TO SUE PEOPLE BUT THAT BUT THAT IS AVAILABLE AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE EO. ONE GOLD MY IGNORANCE FOR ONE SECOND IS THERE A PUBLIC SECTOR EQUIVALENT OF THIS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW PAY DISPARITY. ISN'T JUST. OF RESERVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO IF IF. MY YEAH IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION PUBLIC PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THEIR INFORMATION IS PUBLIC WE CAN GO AND FIND OUT WHAT EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILDING IS PAID BECAUSE IT IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. WHERE AS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT INFORMATION BUT? OKAY I'M SORRY. WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE COMMENT ACTUALLY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE TODAY ABOUT THE MILITARY. AND THE ONE OF THE BENEFITS ABOUT THE MILITARY IF YOU CAN PULL UP ALL OF THE DATA AND YOU CAN SEE AND YOU YOU SEE THAT THERE'S NOT A PAY DISPARITY. BETWEEN THE GENDERS SO I THOUGHT YOU WOULD IN PARTICULAR WOULD APPRECIATE. THAT WELL THERE IS A PAY DISPARITY MY WIFE ALWAYS WAS ONE RANK ABOVE ME ONLY BECAUSE I WAS SMARTER BETTER LEADER AND THEY DISCRIMINATE ON THAT BASIS. BUT SHE WAS ON SHE WAS AT A HIGHER GRADE LEVEL RIGHT SO IT'S EQUAL PAY DISPARITY THAT WAS MENTIONED IS WHEN THEY'RE YOU'RE BOTH ON THE SAME LEVEL. THAT'S ACTIONABLE. THAT WAS TO THE EQUAL PAY LAW BUT BUT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS IS THAT I GET YOUR POINT THAT YOU CAN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU'VE GOT THE TIME ENERGY. AND INTEREST YOU CAN LOOK AT THE TORN FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND SEE AND DO THE SAME KIND OF BREAK UP OUR PUBLIC SECTOR. ENTITIES REQUIRED TO COMPILE IT SO THIS IS MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND AND NOT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PER SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT SO YOU CAN DO THE SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS IS EASILY [inaudible] MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NONE THERE'S A DIFFERENT E. E. O. REPORT I WANT TO SAY IT'S LIKE A E. O. FOR ITO FIVE THAT GOVERNMENT. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES HAVE TO PROVIDE. SO IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT BUT THAT IS GENERALLY WHY THAT INFORMATION IS MORE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IT IS REPORTED ON BUT IN A DIFFERENT FORM. IF YOU CAN GET YOUR FOR ZERO FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER -- BOARD MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT -- COUPLE COUPLE QUESTION BEFORE WE AND ON VOTE ON THE SECTION -- I THINK -- CENTER ON BURKE HAD IT HAS A GOOD POINT AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW. THAT THERE'S NOT A STATE EQUIVALENT TO THIS EVEN THOUGH APPARENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER FORM THAT DOES PROVIDE THE SAME -- AGGREGATED INFORMATION THAT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW -- THE CONFIDENTIALITY I THINK WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE OF FOLKS WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY THAT. THERE IS A PENALTY ATTACHED TO THE DISCLOSING OF THIS INFORMATION -- IN IS IT HAS THAT BEEN INCORPORATED -- THE THE PENALTY -- ASSUMES THAT THERE'S OF A PROBLEM WE'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM I'M NOT INCLINED TO MAKE IT A MISDEMEANOR FOR EMPLOYER DOESN'T COMPLY WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY WE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AT MECHANISM OTHER THAN AN INJUNCTION TO GET THEM TO APPLY WITH ATTORNEYS FEES. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL PENALTY -- FOR ED FOR RELEASING INFORMATION THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WE WON'T GET THEM TO COMPLY BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL SANCTION -- SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVY HANDED IN EXCESSIVE IF WE DO SEE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE RUNNING OUT TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WHICH WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THE PAST. THEN CERTAINLY WE COULD CONSIDER SOMETHING BUT MAKING IT A MISDEMEANOR I THINK IS IS EXCESSIVE AND I THINK IT WILL ALSO -- DISCOURAGE EMPLOYEES FROM DOING THEIR JOB FOR FEAR OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THAT. SO -- MY LAST COUPLE POINTS ARE. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR LITIGATION OR CLASS ACTION -- AND I THINK -- IF YOU IF THE TRUE INTENT IS AS WE'VE HEARD TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE THE PLOT THE LOOK AT THE PLAYING FIELD IS LEVELED. AND WHETHER IT'S DIRECTLY OR OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. OF THAT WE FIND WAYS. TO PROTECT THOSE THAT PARTICIPATE IN THIS TYPE OF OF PROGRAM -- HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THERE COULD BE [inaudible] CORRECTIVE ACTION. MEANING THAT IF THERE IS ANY INDUSTRY OR THERE'S A SPECIFIC BUSINESS. THAT REVEALS THROUGH THERE ARE THREE THEIR DATA ARE THE ESSENTIALLY. IMMUNIZED DURING THIS PERIOD WERE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS BEING PURSUED. WILK. YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THIS IS. DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION AND IT'S IT IS NOT. THE I I THINK. YOUR EMPHASIS IS NOT IN A PLACE WHERE MY EMPHASISES MY EMPHASIS IS TO GET COMPLIANCE. AND IT IS MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION THE COMPANIES WILL VOLUNTARILY COMPLY WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THEY'RE IN FOR THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE IS A SIGNIFICANT PAY DISPARITY. AND WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CLOSE THAT GAP THAT'S THE GOAL THAT'S THE REASON THAT I DIDN'T DO A PUBLIC SHAMING. THERE WAS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC THAT IS NOT MY INTENT MY INTENT IS TO GET COMPANIES TO SELF REFLECT. AND THEN IF THERE IS A CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ARE THE AGENCY THAT IS CALLED UPON TO DO -- THE THE FOLLOW UP WORK TO GET COMPLIANCE -- WHERE WERE YOU WERE CHEST? TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO CORRECT HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF DISCRIMINATION. IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BY THAT SELF REFLECTION AND THEN BY. HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING WORK WITH THESE COMPANIES TO GET THEM TO COMPLY [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT ANY FURTHER -- REQUEST FOR COMMENT I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING -- SO SB ONE SEVEN ONE ON TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE -- AND ASSEMBLY WILL CALL FOR THE ROLE. OF GIVE ME ONE MOMENT -- I'M SORRY WOULD YES YOU'RE RIGHT VERY BRIEF PLEASE AGAIN BY I WOULD CHOOSE TO SIMPLY SUGGEST THAT THIS IS AN AVENUE THAT WAS PURSUED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. TO GET INFORMATION YOU CAN'T CORRECT WHICH YOU DON'T KNOW THIS FORM IS DESIGNED TO PUT A MIRROR TO VARIOUS COMPANIES IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE PUNITIVE IT IS DESIGNED TO BE CORRECTIVE THAT IS MY INTENT THAT IS MY GOAL THAT IS WHAT I THINK THIS BILL WILL DO.
