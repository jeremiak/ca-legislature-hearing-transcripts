ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THREE TWENTY THREE HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND AGAIN THINKING THE SENATORS FOR ALLOW ME TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE- TODAY. SENATORS MANY NEWSPAPERS IN CALIFORNIA'S ARE FAILING THE DEMISE OF NEWSPAPERS WILL MEAN MANY LOST JOBS AND WILL LEAVE MANY COMMUNITIES WITHOUT LOCAL GENERAL JOURNALISM NATIONWIDE NEWSROOM EMPLOYEES HAVE TO CLIMB FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WITH SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED JOBS LOST LAST YEAR ALONE IN THE BAY AREA WHEN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE AND EXAMINER WERE MERGED IN TWO THOUSAND THERE WERE OVER SIX HUNDRED REPORTERS. TODAY THE NUMBER IS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AS WE ALL KNOW FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY IS DEPENDENT ON A WELL FUNCTIONING CONSTITUENCY. I'M SORRY WELL INFORMED CONSTITUENCY. AS AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY THAT REPRESENTS AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE SECTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I AM PROTECTED PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ETHNIC MEDIA. AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO ASIAN AND OTHER ETHNIC NEED NEWSPAPERS COULD BE THE FIRST ONES TO GO. IN ADDITION SOME COUNTIES IN THE STATE MAY BECOME NEWS DESERT WITH NO PAPER OF RECORD. JUSTIN MY DISTRICT ALONE I AM AWARE OF AT LEAST FORTY SIX ETHNIC NEWS PUBLICATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES IN MY COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AS YOU GUYS SENATORS REPRESENT TWICE THE AMOUNT THAT I DO SO I IMAGINE THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE DOUBLE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. IN FACT MY FATHER WHO IS NOW EIGHTY YEARS OLD HAVE ALWAYS RELIED ON THE OPINI ON AS HIS PRIMARY SOURCE OF NEWS. FOR MANY MANY YEARS I REMEMBER AS A CHILD. PICKING UP THE PAPER FOR HIM. AND MANY OF OUR ELDERLY POPULATION ALSO DEPENDS ON THEIR NEWSPAPERS TO GET THEIR NEWS. EVERY MORNING. IF THEY- IF THEY DON'T HAVE THIS- NEWSPAPERS THESE NEWSPAPERS I IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TRANSITION TO GOOGLE TO GET THEIR NEWS. I THOUGHT THIS DECLINE IN COMMUNITY NEWS IS NOT ONLY COSTING US JOBS BUT IT'S ALSO HARMING BOTH ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AND SENIORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GETTING NEWS FROM OUR PHYSICAL PAPERS. NOW WITH ALL OF THIS CONTEXT GOING ON TO THE BACKGROUND NEWSPAPERS ARE FACING AN ADDITIONAL AVERAGE- INCREASE OF 85% AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS IF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DOES NOT EXTEND. THE EXEMPTION FROM AB FIVE FOUR NEWS CARRIERS I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY SMALL PUBLICATIONS THAT DISCUSS FORCE PAPERS TO ABANDON THEIR CONTACT CONTRACT DELIVERY MODEL. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. COMMUNITIES WITHOUT NEWSPAPERS LOSE TOUCH WITH GOVERNMENT BUSINESS EDUCATION AND NEIGHBORS. AGAIN TO USE MY PARENTS AS AN EXAMPLE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS PLAYED A HUGE RLE IN KEEPING THE COMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF BALL INFORM ON CORRUPTION ISSUES WERE THAT. ARE WHICH WERE PLAGUED IN THE CITY HALL AT THAT TIME AND THAT'S WHEN MY PARENTS RESIDE. COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS. AND ETHNIC NEWSPAPERS PLAYED A HUGE IN X. THE- THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO THE RESIDENTS RESTRUCTURE THE CITY COUNCIL AND RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST. SENATORS AND THIS IS WHY AB THREE TWENTY THREE IS HERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. FIRST AB THREE TWENTY THREE WILL EXTEND THE NEWSPAPER CARE YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM TO FROM DYNAMAX TEMPORARILY TO JUNE FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE LANGUAGE HERE CONCERNING NEWSPAPER CARRIERS IS IDENTICAL TO AB ONE SEVENTY FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PROVIDED A ONE YEAR EXEMPTION WE ARE SIMPLY PUSHING. THIS BACK UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SECOND THE BOBBY STATE EIGHT TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO LOCAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SPECIFICALLY ETHNIC MEDIA AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AND CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS FOR MARKETING AND ARE BEACH ADVERTISING SERVICES. THE EXEMPTION INCLUDED IN AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE CONSIDERS THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP THE PANDEMIC HAS PLACED ON THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY ON TOP OF AN ALREADY DIMINISHING CELLS IN RETURN REVENUES. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT THE EXTENSION DOES NOT ALLOW THE NEWSPAPERS TO ESCAPE THE CURRENT LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DELIVERED DELIVERY DRIVERS UNDER THE PAROLE OF STANDARD. REFERENCE GIVEN TO LOCAL MEDIA WILL BENEFIT BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND PUBLISHERS ALIKE BY ENSURING THAT THE PUBLICATIONS ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND CAN EXIST WELL INTO THE FUTURE. AND THAT JOBS THESE PUBLICATIONS PROVIDE CAN ALSO EXIST. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I AM AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY THAT PRINT THAT REPRESENTS AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE SECTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ETHNIC MEDIA BECAUSE I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DYNAMIC MEDIA OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN HOST AND THE HOST OF LANGUAGES. NOT EVERYBODY GOES TO THE SAME PLACE FOR SOURCES OF NEWS AND INFORMATION AND I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN KEEPING I THINK MAY BE A VIABLE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA. I THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO- WE DO HAVE- TWO WITNESSES BUT TO DO THAT JUST WANTED TO- ANNOUNCED THAT DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS. INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED IN THIS CASE IT IN TODAY'S HEARING. FOUR MINUTES TOTAL TIME- FOR THE SUPPORT AND FOUR MINUTES FOR OPPOSITION ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME. AFFILIATION AND THEIR POSITION ON THE MEASURE SO WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- JIM BEARD OF CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION GENERAL COUNSEL AND ARTURO CARMONA SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. INTERMEDIA AND THE LAW OPINIONS TO OF. HOWEVER WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST PLEASE BEGIN JIM. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JIM DO YOU WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO AND THE SENATE COOPER'S FOR AMENDING AB THREE TWENTY THREE TO SAVE LOCAL JOURNALISM- MISTER CHAIR I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR EXPERTISE- IN. HELPING TO DEVELOP THIS AS WELL. LAST YEAR I APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN AND ASK YOU TO SUPPORT GIVING NEWSPAPERS A ONE YEAR EXEMPTION OR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS FROM THE ABC TEST. THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY AB FIVE AND THE DYNAMICS DECISION. THREE PAPERS INTENDED TO USE THAT TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF DISTRIBUTION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. BEGINNING ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS AND THEN COATED NINETEEN AB AND- REPORTS OF EVERY SIZE AND TYPE EXPERIENCED AD REVENUE LOSSES THAT THREATEN THEIR VERY EXISTENCE. SMALL MIDSIZE NEWSPAPERS INCLUDING ETHNIC PUBLICATIONS. TOP 56% DECREASE IN JUST THREE MONTHS. DALEY'S 48% DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. WE THINK THAT DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SIMILAR. OUR NUMBERS WILL BE REPORTED. IN ADDITION EIGHTEEN NEWSPAPERS HAVE SHUT DOWN THEIR PRINT OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T MAKE ENDS MEET AND ALL OF THIS HAPPENED AT A TIME WHEN DEMAND FOR INFORMATION FROM NEWSPAPERS ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN IS HIGHER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. WELL DIGITAL REVENUES GROWING FOR DAILY USE. PRINT REVENUE IS STILL THEIR WHITE BLOOD AND IT IS EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL FOR SMALL TO MIDSIZE NEWSPAPERS. AB THREE TWENTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE THE BREATHING SPACE NECESSARY TO FOR THESE NEWSPAPERS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WHICH SOME PROJECTIONS ESTIMATE WILL TAKE AS LONG AS FIVE YEARS. THAT BELIEVE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL NEWSPAPERS THAT WILL LIKELY DISAPPEAR LEAVING THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH NO LOCAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND THOSE THAT DO SURVIVE WILL LIKELY ELIMINATE HOME DELIVERY TO RURAL AREAS. ELIMINATING JOBS SUCH AS JOURNALISTS. IN OTHER POSITIONS. AB THREE TWENTY THREE IS ABOUT SAVING LOCAL JOURNALISM AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER WORD NOW MISTER CARMONA. PLEASE IN.

MINERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ARE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE THE POWER DYNAMIC IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY MAKES IT ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN FEAR THAT IT WILL COMPROMISE THEIR ABILITY. TO WORK EVERY WORKPLACE SHOULD BE FREE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION AND RETALIATION AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE- WILL PROMOTE AGE APPROPRIATE DISCUSSIONS AMONG MINERS AND THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND CREATE A SAFER WORKPLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU AND WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FOR HIS CONTINUING WORK IN THIS AREA I KNOW YOU'RE ON CONSENT SO PLEASE. PARDON ME FOR HAVING TO PULL BUT I JUST WANTED TO RAISE AN ISSUE. ON THAT IF IT WERE ON CONSENT I WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. JUST AS THE RULE THAT A POINT OF REFERENCE INFORMATION OUT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LET LEVINE AND I INTRODUCED AND PASSED TWO SEPARATE BILLS FOCUSED ON ENSURING EMPLOYERS. PROVIDED SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS. WITH THE INTENTION OF EMPLOYEES WILL BE TEN TO THE MAKING SURE EMPLOYEES COULD GET ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEEDED. TO CURTAIL UNWANTED. AND INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT TRAINING HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR ALL EMPLOYERS WE BOTH AGREE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I KNOW THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE TO THE BILL BEFORE US. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO RAISE IT SOME CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE FOUNDATIONS. BUILT BY AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT IS PREVIOUS BILL THAT ARE TIED TO THE CURRENT BILL BEFORE US. UNDER CURRENT STATUTE. AGE ELIGIBLE MINORS ARE DEFINED AS. FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. WHICH MEANS UNDER CURRENT LAW CHILDREN TO. CAME. FOURTEEN YEAR. AND OLDER DO ACCESS. TO SEXUAL HER. PREVENTION UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEAVES CHILDREN BELOW THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE SAME PREVENTION TRAINING PROGRAMS. OLDER MINORS ARE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE. THAT'S IMPORTANT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE AGAIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I CO AUTHORED ALONG WITH OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR LARA SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WHICH IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INDUSTRY. PROHIBIT ANY MINOR UNDER THE AGE OF TO WAIVE THEM RIGHTS WITHOUT THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT AS YOU KNOW HOW WE ARE DEFINING KIND OF AGE OF MATURITY WHEN YOU FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. WELL AGAIN THAT BILL PERTAINS TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPACE IT'S ANOTHER REMINDER THAT WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AT EVERY AGE AND STAGE IN THEIR LIFE AND WHETHER THEY'RE INTERFACING WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR THEY'RE- THEY'RE YOUNG ACTORS IT'S EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT WE ACKNOWLEDGE. AGES AND STAGES OF MATURITY SO I DID SUPPORT TWENTY THREE THIRTY THAT THE TIME IT BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THESE BILLS AND ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT THAT NOT ALL CHILD IS IMMUNE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND ALL ACTORS REGARDLESS OF AGE SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW THEIR RIGHTS SO I JUST WANTED TO RAISE A THAT ISSUE GOING ON THE PREVIOUS BILL- YOU SET THAT AGE RANGE THE MIDDLE MADE FROM FOURTEEN. AND HOPE THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITY HAVE ON GOING TO. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST. WE ARE LEAVING MANY CHILDREN VOTE. AND ADDRESS. FAR TOO MANY IF WE LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE CASES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US. NOT BEFORE US WOULD HAVE BECOME PUBLIC ALL THE YOUNG WOMEN ON PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THE- JIM THIS- SO MANY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE COME. MAY THERE OWN SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT PUBLIC WE KNOW THAT FOURTEEN IS NOT A MAGICAL AGE AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE- AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE YOU. OUR COLLECTIVE TO PERHAPS COME BACK IN FUTURE YEARS AND ADDRESS THAT AGE I KNOW THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS FIGURING OUT WHO'S ALLOWED TO DO THE TRAINING PARENTS HAVE TO BE ENGAGE I GET THAT. BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE. NOT LEAVE AT BEST IT WILL SOON FOURTEEN AT THE APPROPRIATE AGE TO REQUIRE THIS KIND OF TRAINING TO EMPOWER CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO YOU- FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS HERE- WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER- WEEK OR SO AGO IN THE GARAGE AND WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO CONNECT- BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU THEN. WAS ON HOW CREATIVE I WAS OF- YOUR PRESENCE IN THE- THE OVERSIGHT HEARING ON CORRECTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND SO YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND PURSUING- THINGS OVER TIME- IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MUCH STRONGER FOR- AND- WITH REFERENCE TO THIS ISSUE. WE'VE BOTH BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THIS BILL IS- BILL NUMBER I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SINCE I FIRST INTRODUCED THE FIRST VERSION. I BELIEVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL UNTIL THE ME TOO MOVEMENT PUSH THIS UP. IN THE MINDS OF- THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES AND SO FORTH SO- YES WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO I BELIEVE THERE IS ANOTHER BILL COMING UP LATER. ON THE AGENDA THAT ALSO ADDRESSES THIS AND- AND SO- OUR WORK IS CUT OUT FOR US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR VERY KIND WORDS AND I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT AS FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY AGE APPROPRIATE TRAINING BUT BEING REALISTIC AT WHAT AGE THIS TRAINING MUCH START FOURTEEN EIGHTH GRADERS FOR MY HOMEBUILDING IN FAR TOO LATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ONE OF. RIGHT I JUST ALSO JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SAY YES CERTAINLY- AT FIRST I WANT THANK YOU SIMILAR LEAN FOR YOUR WORK AND THEN- ON ON THIS ISSUE- I DO AGREE WITH CENTER MITCHELL AND I KNOW THAT YOU DO AS WELL- YOU KNOW FROM A DEVELOPMENTAL STANDPOINT. THAT PHYSICAL PUBERTY FOR GIRLS ACTUALLY START CAN START EARLY AS EIGHT. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ELEMENTAL UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AND AGE APPROPRIATE BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO- YOU KNOW ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AN AGE APPROPRIATE WAY FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALSO DRESSING YOU KNOW EDUCATING THEIR PARENTS AS WELL- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED WORK IN THIS AREA AND THIS ISSUE- BUT AS REGARDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN AND AS WE LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN I THINK THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT TO THOSE WHO PREY ON CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE WE'VE GOT- TO CONTINUE WORKING ON SO THANK YOU. I THANK. YOU A SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT. IS GETTING A LITTLE EXPANDED AND- I THINK IT SHOULD SHOULD BE WE KNOW THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS NOTORIOUS. WHETHER IT'S CHILDREN OR ADULTS. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY HIGHLY PUBLICIZED INCIDENTS AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE THAN AREN'T. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US NOT ONLY TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY ON SET WITH THEM AS THEIR GUARDIANS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PERPETRATORS ARE WELL AWARE THAT THERE ARE A CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CONSEQUENCES TO THIS BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CATCH IT ALL THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE ALMOST BY DEFINITION A VERY VULNERABLE THEIR CHILDREN- AND- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE WE KEEP THE- OF THE KLIEG LIGHTS IF YOU WILL- IN VERY SHARP- DIRECTION- ON THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF JUST THE INHERENT. NATURE OF ITS HISTORY AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS KIND OF ABUSE- BASED UPON THE IMBALANCE OF POWER. IN OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS SO- I ALSO THANK YOU FOR THIS AND AGREE WITH THE SENATOR MITCHELL THAT. REALLY THE VULNERABILITY IS SOMETHING THAT. OCCURS EVEN AT YOUNGER AGES BUT AND BUT THIS IS A WHOLE ISSUE- I HATE TO SELECT THIS INDUSTRY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT HISTORICALLY IT HAS A VERY MURKY PAST- AND WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES VERY RECENTLY WITH A- SORT OF THE QUOTE UNQUOTE GLAMOUR FOLKS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN. I IT REALLY IS AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE TO DO- AND BE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN OUR PROTECTION OF THIS FEW OF THE ISSUES AND ALSO PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE SO THANK YOU. AGAIN FOR DOING THIS AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON. OKAY THANK YOU ARE THERE IN THE OF THE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

SOME MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AN- YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SHARES AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH WHAT THE COST FROM PLAYER MANDATED TRAINING PROGRAMS CONSTITUTE AS A NECESSARY EXPENDITURE FOR DIRECT PATIENT CARE WORKERS AND JOB APPLICANTS THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS FROM REQUIRING DIRECT PATIENT CARE WORKERS AND JOB APPLICANTS TO COVER THE COST WILL REIMBURSE THE EMPLOYER FOR ANY EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAININGS ARE PROGRAMS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE HOSPITALS TO PAY FOR ANY LICENSING OR CERTIFICATION NECESSARY TO LEGALLY PRACTICE IN THE SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION. I LEARNED THAT SOME HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS HAVE REQUIRE JOB APPLICANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYER REQUIRED TRAININGS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. HOLDEN THE WORKER OR APPLICANT FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EMPLOYER REQUIRED TRAININGS BY OBGYN TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT TO WORK FOR THE HOSPITAL FOR A DESIRED TIME OR REIMBURSE. THE EMPLOYER THEY LEAVE BEFORE THE SPECIFIED TIMES AND ACCEPT IS ACTUALLY UNACCEPTABLE THE PLACE ISN'T ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN. FOR NURSES SEEKING EMPLOYMENT. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A GROWING NURSING SHORTAGE AND THIS PANDEMIC WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THE SITUATION AND THE NEED TO RECRUIT MORE HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY IT WOULD SIMPLY CLARIFIED THAT EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAININGS CONSTITUTE AS A NECESSARY EXPENDITURE. PROHIBITING HEALTH CARE EMPLOYERS FROM COMPELLING DIRECT PATIENT CARE WORKERS AND JOB APPLICANTS TO PAY FOR EMPLOYER MANDATED TRAININGS OR PROGRAMS. BUT WITH ME TODAY A PROVIDING A TESTIMONY TO OUR JACKSON CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AND MISTAKEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBER LET'S NOW MOVE TO THE WITNESSES AND- WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES.

JACKSON FOR THE NURSES FOLLOWED BY MIX STAGGER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION SO LET'S. BEGIN WITH THE TAYLOR JACKSON PLEASE. HERE NUMBER ASKING GOOD MORNING TAYLOR THAT WOULD COVER NURSES. WE ARE FONG OF THE TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT. NEIGHBORHOOD REQUIRE EMPLOY PAID CAR NOTHING FOR WORKERS TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR COSTS INCURRED BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYER. THE COURTS HAVE RULED IT INCLUDES EMPLOYER REQUIRED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS OR TRAINING. I'M THE OPPOSITE AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY EXTENDED PROTECTION TO JOB APLICANTS. TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROTECTED IN THE SAME WAY THE LAW ALREADY PROTECTS EMPLOYEES. IN A HAVE BEEN FIRSTHAND OR EMPLOYER COMPOSING THESE TALK ON JOB APPLICANTS- CURRENT LAW. YLIDES ARE CHOOSING TO TRACK JOB APPLICANTS CONTRACT SHOULD BEGIN THE FUTURE EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS. THE COURT ALREADY TEAMS BELONG TO THE EMPLOYER. IT IS NOT THE EMPLOYEE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR IT IT SHOULD BE THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBILITY. EITHER REPORTER ARE CURRENTLY. FOR THE CALL OF THEIR CENTERS WHICH I THINK PER. FOR THEM TO LEGALLY FOR THAT'S WHAT THE VICTIMS COSTS. FOR NURSING NAMES ARE THEATER BACHELOR DEGREE. IN THERE AND LOOK LIKE PEOPLE BAND AND THE BELUM CARE COOLEY. ROCK IT LOOKS DOES HE- WE ARE CONTINUING WORK WITH DEPARTMENT INDUSTRIAL ROCK RELATIONS IN STATE CALLED. TO FURTHER THE LANGUAGE AND WE SHOULD BE REACHING REGULAR YEAH.

LABOR FOR ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WOULD ALIGN OURSELVES WITH COMMENTS THE AND PREVIOUS WITNESS.

A YEAR UNDER THE CONTROL OF EMPLOYER FOR THE AND YOU BE. FOR THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THAT THE WORKER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASSUME THE COST THEMSELVES AND TO DO SO TO REQUIRE THEM TO RECEIVE THAT KIND OF EMPLOYER SPECIFIC TRAINING AND NOT PAY THEM FOR IT IS REALLY A KIND OF WAIT STAFF AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT AND WE DON'T THINK SHOULD CONTINUE. I THINK THIS BILL DOES A GREAT JOB OF CLOSING THAT LOOPHOLE IN A FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE AND ANALYZED AND MEASURED WAY WE URGE YOUR. SUPPORT THANK. OKAY VERY MUCH WITH THAT LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO OTHER TESTS. IN SO.

AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. PLEASE PROCEED. THANKS VERY MUCH- NOW LET'S MOVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS UNDER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEN NONE- RECALL RIGHT THIS CERTAINLY IS A COMMON SENSE IN MY MIND- BILL AND CERTAINLY IT'S- APPROPRIATE THAT- THAT. PLEASE NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE JOB THAT'S NOT RELATED TO THAT REALLY FRANKLY ISN'T. TO HAVE ANY DIRECT GAIN FOR THEMSELVES- OUTSIDE OF THEIR FUNCTIONING IN THE JOB. SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THINK OF ALL THE DEPARTMENT PAS- CENTER JACKSON NEXT YEAR HAND UP NOW. I'M SORRY I'M A LITTLE SLOW ON THE TREE CARE I KEEP. HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THEM REYES HAND- IT'S JUST A ONE ONE QUESTION I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS- IT WAS. BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT- THERE MIGHT BE A BENEFIT TO A LITTLE GREATER CLARITY. FOR EXAMPLE IF IT SHOWS THAT YOU NEED TO BE- WORDS ED CAPABLE OF YOU KNOW I. UNDERSTAND A PARTICULAR TYPE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS. RELATIVELY COMMON UP WITH THAT ALSO BE INCLUDED UNDER- A TRAINING THAT WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYER IN OUR COMPUTER CERTIFICATION FOR EXAMPLE ON A- WORD CERTIFIED OR WHATEVER OR WE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT FOCUS VERY SPECIFICALLY. ON THE NATURE OF. THE WORK THAT A NURSE FOR SOME MEDICAL TRAINEE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN GENERAL TRAINING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF THE SENATOR- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK THAT TOOK FOCUS HERE REALLY IS ON THE EMPLOYER MANDATES A TRAINING OF A TRAINING PROGRAM OR SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO. THE WORK THAT'S BEING ASKED OF THESE TO RED RIVER DIRECT CARE PERSONNEL SO- IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING. ASKED OF A OF THE APPLICANT AND THEN AND THEN IN THAT CASE IT WOULD APPLY IF IT'S IF IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE JOB THAT IS BEING- ASKED OF THE OF THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE WORKER BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IF IT'S A MUCH MORE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE KIND OF ISSUE OF IMAGINE. THAT THAT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW A PART OF THE INTERPRETATION WHETHER IT REALLY IS SPECIFIC TO THAT JOB OR NOT BUT IT REALLY IT RELLY COMES DOWN TO- IF THAT BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE VERY WELL MAY BE SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OR SOFTWARE WITHOUT YOU THAT MAY BE LOST- THAT THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURE BUT TO YOUR POINT. I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD IT WOULD BE TRAINING THAT'S BEING ASKED OF BY THE EMPLOYER THAT IS REQUIRED OF THE WORKER IN ORDER TO DO. THAT JOB OR BE HIRED FOR THAT JOB. OF MY OWN SUGGESTION IS IF YOU WERE GET A- IT DOESN'T IN ANYWAY IN. MY INTIMACY. FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- IF THERE COULD BE SOME CLARITY ON THAT I THINK IT MIGHT HELP. GOING FORWARD WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE SO MAYBE A LITTLE TWEAKING OF THE LANGUAGE GOING FORWARD. I JUST A SUGGESTION ARE CRITICAL MY GOD HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT AND WORK WITH THE SPONSORS AND WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF HERE AS WELL AS IT. IS WELL AS IT- AS THE BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES FORWARD WE CAN WORK WITH YOU KNOW. APPROPRIATE SENATE COMMITTEES STAFF AND TAKE YOUR STRESS ON THE- MONEY.

WORKERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE ALREADY AMONG THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THESE WORKERS NEED ASSURANCE THAT THEIR JOBS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM IF AND WHEN BUSINESSES REOPENED AND THAT PANDEMIC RELATEDLY ALSO NOT USED AS AN EXCUSE TO ENGAGE IN PREJUDICIAL UNWARRANTED TERMINATIONS. RIGHT A RECALL AND RETENTION WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT LAID OFF WORKERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY GETTING BACK THEIR SAME JOB WAS SIR PLAYER BEGINS WE HIRING IT IS TRULY A JOB SAVER.

EPIC CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND JOHN CALDWELL CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION GENTLEMAN YOU WILL HAVE A FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES TOTAL TIME BETWEEN YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS BUT HAVING COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND YOU MISTER CHAIR ON THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BUT WE STOP SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE WRITER RECALL WORKER RETENTION PROVISIONS OF THE STOCK. FIRST THE RECALL PROVISIONS ARE SIMPLY UNWORKABLE AND WILL SLOW DOWN BUSINESS RE OPENING AND WORKERS GETTING BACK TO WORK AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE B. THIRTY TO SIXTY REQUIRES COVERED EMPLOYERS OFFER TO RECALL LAID OFF WORKERS BY SENIORITY. IT TO PROVIDES A COMPLETE TEN BUSINESS DAYS TO RESPOND BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE TO OFFER THE POSITION TO THE NEXT MOST SENIOR EMPLOYEE. THAT IS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE AND WOULD TAKE WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS FOR THE EMPLOYER TO REOPEN. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS. ARDLEY A POLICY THAT SUPPORTS BUSINESSES RE OPENING A WORKERS GETTING BACK TO WORK. IN ADDITION AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO OFFER POSITIONS NOT ONLY TO THE EMPLOYEE WHO PREVIOUSLY HELD THE POSITION. BUT TO ANY EMPLOYEE WHO WAS QUOTE. IT IS OR CAN BE QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB WITH TREATING. THIS COULD LITERALLY BE EVERY WORKER THIS WILL ONLY SERVE TO BOG DOWN THE PROCESS AND GROWING BUSINESS THREE OPENING TO A HALT AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. SECOND THESE BILLS. USE OF ONE PARTY LIABILITY THAT WILL CRIPPLE BUSINESSES. I JUST GOT THE BILL DOUBLES AS A COMPLEX AND UNWORKABLE REHIRE PROCESS. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE ANY VIOLATION OF THAT COMPLEX PROCESS. THIRD AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN RAISES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WE APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF THE ANALYSIS FROM THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. BUT WE DO THINK THERE ARE SERIOUS CONTRACT CLAUSE ISSUES RAISED WITH THIS PROPOSAL. WHEN I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS IN PROVIDED SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AS PART OF A SIGNED AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL IS NOTACKNOWLEDGE THOSE CASES AND RAISES THE POTENTIAL THAT THAT'S RIGHT TO RECALL WOULD BE ARGUE TO ABROGATE THE SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS. WHICH IS ALSO A VIOLATION OF THE CONTRACT CLAUSE. FINALLY IN PARTICULAR THE WORKER RETENTION ASPECT OF THIS BILL IS NOT ANYTHING NEW. AS PART OF A LONGSTANDING LABOR PRIORITY. OF THE KNOWLEDGE IS NOT SERVING NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AROUND. OVER THE YEARS. MOST NOTABLY AB THIRTY. THREE ARE YOU TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND THE LIST OF COVERED INDUSTRIES IN THIS BILL MAKES CLEAR TO US THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED PRIMARILY AT PRESERVING YOUR- GOT IT. HI UNION. STREET. APRIL QUIET IS THE CLASSROOM WHERE TO. A MUCH OF WORK. THAT MAY BE A POLICY TO COMMITTEE SO. BUT IF SO WE THINK WOULD SHOULD BE TRYING. ABOUT WHAT GOING ON. FOR THESE REASONS WE- THE THIRTY TWO. AND THAT'S FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IN OFFICE. MITCHUM MEMBERS CALLED ON BEHALF OF THE HOTEL LODGING. TO LODGING IN IS A SPECIAL HARD HIT THIS PANDEMIC MORE THAN A THOUSAND HOTELS HAVE CLOSED FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. THOSE IN A REMAINED OPEN HAVE OPERATED AT MAYBE 20% CAPACITY AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND HOTEL WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED. OF COURSE THESE HOTEL OWNERS STILL HAVE TO PAY EXPENSES SUCH AS MORTGAGES AND PROPERTY TAXES. BUT TO ALL THIS THE INDUSTRY HAS STEPPED UP. THOSE BETTER. HAVE HOUSE. WORKERS LIKE POLICE FIRE DOCTORS NURSES. THEY HAVE INSTITUTED CLEANING PROTOCOLS AND EXCEED CDC REQUIREMENTS AND AT THEIR HOUSE THE HOMELESS WITH OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOMS STATEWIDE BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE. EVERYONE WANTS THESE HOTELS TO OPEN UP AND BRING BACK THEIR EMPLOYEES. BUT AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN WILL MAKE WE OPENING HOTELS COSTLY TIME CONSUMING AND SUBJECT TO AN ALREADY AND SUBJECT THEM TO- THE- AND ALREADY SUFFERING LODGING INDUSTRY. TO A SLEW OF LAWSUITS. THE TIME MONEY SPENT BY HOTELS TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THIS WILL DELAY THE REHIRING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO WORK AGAIN THIS INDUSTRY IS HURTING PLEASE VOTE NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TO CALDWELL WE WILL NOW GO TO THIS OPPOSITION WITNESSES THAT WOULD WISH TO TESTIFY WITH THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND THEIR POSITION ON THE BILL- ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEEING NO ONE LOOKING AT ROOM ONE TWELVE IS THERE ANYONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WISHING TO SPEAK.

THERE ANY FURTHER LINE UP IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN THREE TWO ONE SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. BUT THIS TIME WE HAVE KNOWN FOR THEIR QUEUING UP THANK YOU MODERATOR APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK TODAY SO W'VE HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS AND I SEE SENATOR JACKSON. HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT CENTER JACKSON. WE SEE YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR- I AM A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I DON'T. PRINCIPALLY CO AUTHOR HOLD WATER BILLS THIS IS. A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. HIS PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO OUR WORKERS- I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS ARTICULATE AND GLAMPING AND I CLEARLY HEADED SAW. IDMS DOWN- MANY OF WHICH I THINK ARE SPACIOUS BUT NONETHELESS- PERHAPS PERSUASIVE ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE. AND I WAS STRUCK BY THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MANY OF THEM IMMIGRANTS THEY DON'T SPEAK. ENGLISH THEY'RE HARD WORKING FOLKS MANY OF THEM HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS FOR THESE VARIOUS COMPANIES- THEY DO- BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND SECURITY AND MANY OF THEM ARE OVERWHELMINGLY. THE WOMEN IMMIGRANT AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THIS DOES IS GIVE THEM FIRST DIBS AT RETURNING TO THEIR JOBS. THESE BUSINESSES REOPEN AND SHOULD NEW BUSINESSES ATTACK OVER IN THEIR PLACE AND IF THE CHAMBER WISHES US TO BE TRANSPARENT AND HONEST LOOK HE SAID PART OF THE REASON THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO DO SOME UNION BUSTING- AND- I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE- REASON. THAT HAVE THIS BILL. IN THE FIRST PLACE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO JUST SIMPLY WANT THEIR OBS BACK THEY WEREN'T FIRED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GOOD AT THEIR JOBS THEY LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE FIRST DIBS AND GETTING THEIR JOBS. OUT WHEN AND IF THESE COMPANIES DESPITE TO REOPEN AND FRANKLY MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE TEN DAYS OR MORE% BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAMP UP- TO BE ABLE TO. COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAWS MAYBE A NEW PROTOCOL CONTROL FOUR CHARGE I FIND THOSE ARE. BE LESS THAN COMPELLING. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE LOOK TO THE PEOPLE BUSINESS CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK AND- IT'S REALLY- IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TO OFFER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WE WANT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE JOBLESS TO THE EXTENT WERE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO FOR A SIGNATURE SEGMENT THE- NATION FRANKLY AND THIS. SOME PIECES OF THE BILL HAS TAKEN ON THE END OF BELIEVE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY CHECKED. SURE IS THE RESULT OF THIS CALL PANDEMIC. WHERE PARENTS SUPPOSED TO DO THE KIDS ARE HOME I IN MANY INSTANCES THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO CARE FOR THEM ARE THEY- WHAT DO WE DO LET SIX YEAROLD STAY HOME ALONE- BECAUSE PARENTS HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A JOB AND CARING FOR THEIR CHILDREN I THINK THIS IS A- VERY POOR. CHOICE IN A HOBSON'S CHOICE THAT. DOES NOT SPEAK WELL ABOUT WHAT WE AS A SOCIETY. HAVE DONE IN PRIORITIZING WHAT'S IN LIFE. THAT BEING SAID- THE- THE BILL ALSO. I THINK IT REMOVES THE EXTENDED REASONS FOR USING LEAVE A JURY THE DAY TOMORROW HE I ALSO WORK DID LEDGES. TO EXPAND LEAVE DURING THE SCHOOL CLOSURES ALSO FACED AN UPHILL BATTLE AND FRANKLY I'M CONCERNED THAT WE COULD AND- LEGISLATORS. WILL PUT ANY. LATE GOING WAS SCHOOL. STATE BURNING I AM VERY SURE CHILD CARE ISSUES THEY'RE REAL THIS IS NOT GOING AWAY AND YET ARE THIS NO DAY. WE SHOULD TAKE A PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOBS BACK- INTERESTED TO ME IS SO CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF. A TRYING TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED I'M I'VE ALSO HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY THEY DON'T LIKE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS IS BINDLE STANDING A CHAMBER TALKING AND I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE CALL THIS THING OUT STRIP PRIVATE BY OF ACTION IS ALSO DENYING FULL ACCESS THE COURT BECAUSE JUSTICE AWAY. COMMITTEE NOPE RIGHT AT ALL AND I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ASKING GOOD LEGEND TO LIST WE DON'T GUARANTEE FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE SEEKING. OUR PRESS FOR STATE. NOTION THAT THEY'LL LOSE LAW MY RESPONSE IS IF YOU FALL ALTHOUGH ARE YOU NOT GOING TO GO SUED. I MEAN LET'S FACE IT THIS JUST MY THAT IS NEVER BEEN A DEMONSTRATED TO BE ACT BUT IT'S A GOOD. POINT IN IT'S ONE THAT SCARES PEOPLE AND I'M I'M SO DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DON'T CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ENFORCEMENT INTO REMEDIES. AND THERE'S NO THAN WORK OUR BASICALLY WORTHLESS SO- ALSO NEED TO WORK TO POINT TO IN THE IN OUR- FROM PAGE SIX. IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT- WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO DO- IT PROVIDES THAT REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS. OF THE- COLLUDED FOLLOWING HIRING IN REINSTATEMENT BECAUSE FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT THESE GUYS WANT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SUE THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK AND THEY ARE THE DATE ALSO CALLS FOR SOME COMPENSATION FOR THOSE DAYS THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GET BACK TO WORK THERE WERE NO CRIMINAL IN THIS LEDGER. SOBER UP IF THE EMPLOYEE HAS TO SUE AND IS THE PROPELLING CARTAGE BE TITLED WOULD TURN FEES. RIGHT TOURNEY'S WON'T TAKE CASE. IF EIGHT IF THEY'RE DOING A PROBLEM. I IN THE CENTER OF COURSE FROM FROM OUR CORPORATE AMERICA'S WILL OR SHOULD WORK FOR FREE BUT SHE ALSO THESE BIG CORPORATIONS ONE BIG FAT PAYCHECKS BUT THEY WANT THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTING THE LITTLE GUY. TO DO IT GO IN FIRST. A THE THANKS LARGELY. THE SAN SHOULD COMMITTEE WHICH I'M HONORED TO SHARE I BILL IT'S- UP IN PAGES NINE OF THE AND NOW. I DON'T OR ANY ISSUES THAT ARE. IF THEY DON'T LIKE. THE LAW OF THE THING THAT THEY'RE SHOULD BE VIOLATED THEY KNOW WHERE THE CORE. ROOMS ARE THAT I WANT TO WORK AT TO MOVE THE BILL I WANT SEE IF WE COULD TO GIVE SIX SERIOUS THOUGHT CAN. TO THOSE WORKING. OUT THERE. GET THEIR. BACK WHO ARE DESPERATE TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR RAY AND SHE THEIR TO. AND HELP THEM THAT WILL BE A TO. FLOOR AND YOU HAVE. AND SAFE AND THAT'S BUT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO ONE. AREA OUR ECONOMY AND I IT MUCH. AND WITH THAT- AGAIN WILL MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FROM NIKE'S INTERJECTION OTHER COMMENTS OR CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE CENTER PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CENTER KERR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- IN EUROPE DURING THIS COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WERE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF IT YES MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING BUSINESSES ARE SUFFERING WORKERS ARE SUFFERING AND- I APPRECIATE THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. NOW THAT THE OPPONENTS TALKED ABOUT THE YOUNG THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY KNOW THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IS SUFFERING GREATLY. AND SO ARE ALL THE WORKERS AS WELL AND IF WE REALLY APPROACH THIS IN A SENSE OF THAT WE ALL NEED TO PULL TOGETHER. I CERTAINLY HOPE THE END OF THIS BILL AS PART OF THIS IS THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORKING TOGETHER THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YOU SHOULD HELP GET THEIR JOBS BACK IF YOU'RE ABLE TO OPEN. AND I'M YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SO THE SALUTE LET'S THINK ABOUT HOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST SOME. MODICUM OF STABILITY DURING A FAIRLY CHAOTIC TIME WITH THIS PANDEMIC AND PANDEMICS OR SIMPLY CHAOTIC. I DO I THINK WE HAD SOME GOOD DISCUSSION OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS- IT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL BUT ALSO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN YOU'RE CALLING PEOPLE BACK OF COURSE THE JOBS THAT THEY ARE. YOU KNOW QUALIFY FOR THE DAY FUNDS SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T WANT IT HOUSEKEEPER TRYING TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT OR ACCOUNT TRYING TO BE A SO. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE LANGUAGES- REGARDING YOU KNOW TERMS OF THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND JUST LIMITED THE TIME OF KOVITZ WHAT'S NINE. BY BUT IT'S A ALSO THE OTHER PIECES THAT. YOU AND I KNOW TALKED ALSO SURE THAT WE WANT THE MECHANISMS TO REALLY TRY TO GET THE WORKERS- YOU KNOW BACK TO THEIR JOBS THAT IS. THE SOONEST POSSIBLE WHEN THOSE JOBS ARE AVAILABLE. SO I'M NOT WHETHER TIED UP IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THE COURTS. NO I PERSONALLY- AND MAYBE DIFFER FROM CENTER JACKSON I'M YEAH HOUSE USUALLY SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ABOUT TRYING TO EXPAND RIDER REPORTS OF ACTIONS. SO DO YOU FEEL WE NEED TO A MECHANISM. THAT WOULD HELP YES THE WORK BACK TO THE JOB AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND- YOU KNOW THINGS ARE SORT OF BACKED UP IN MANY DIFFERENT PLACES SO WHATEVER WE CAN TRY TO DO BUT THOSE MECHANISM THERE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET RESPECT BY. TAKING FROM THE- THERE REALLY TRULY COMMITTED THIS IDEA OF RANGER WORKERS. AND SO IT I REALLY THANK YOU FOR DOING THE BILL AND- APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN'S FIFTEEN NO OTHER COMMENTS OF. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALLER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT CALLED IN A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF WORKERS A LOT OF WORKERS THAT ARE NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW. BUT TOOK THE TIME TO DO THAT- THIS BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY AS WE FIRST LEARNED. ABOUT THE EXCEL RIGHT IS PART OF THE VIRUS YOU MEET SAW THE TIME AND THE BILL AND ON OUR ECONOMY BUSH'S WORK FOR SOMEBODY NOT YEARS THAT ARE EXISTING JOB PROTECTIONS ARE INADEQUATE TO PROTECT PRESERVE WORKERS WHO FACE COMMENTED A CHALLENGES COMMON COLD INJURY IS JUST WHAT WE ALL JUST GO THROUGH- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS I WANT TO THANK CENTER JACKSON FOR YEARS THINKING ABOUT FAMILIES NOW WE CAN PROTECT AND CARE FOR OUR FAMILIES NOT JUST DURING THIS CALL THE CRISIS BUT IN GENERAL WE DON'T DO ENOUGH ISSUES RECOGNIZE THAT AND AGAIN TODAY. FURTHERMORE AND I PUT THAT. WE KNEW IT THE CURRENT LAW A NOTE. FOR THE NAY PROTECT. NEEDED TO COME BACK DEPEND ECONOMIC AND WORKPLACE IMPACTS. OUR APPROACHES ONE TO ENSURE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO RETURN TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO PUT IN PLACE UNIFORMED DESPERATE JOB PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL STARTED OUT AS A CODE NINETEEN LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT RESPONSE BILL. WAS CRAFTED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES WHICH INCLUDED JOB TO LEAVE. TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC CARE ISSUES ARISING FROM PANDEMIC. PAID SICK LEAVE TO ALLOW WORKERS CONTRACTED OVER TO STAY HOME. AND RELAXING MEDICAL SERVICE CERTIFICATION. WE TO PROCURE ON TO CIRCUMSTANCES. WORKERS FACE. IT TOO HAS CAST ITS TOLL UPON THIS BILL ALONG THE WAY IT HAD TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS TO ASSURE PASSAGE INTO THE BILL HEARD ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS BY THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND CUT FROM THIS BILL AND I. JOIN IN AND DOES CENTER JACKSON'S DISAPPOINTMENT IN THAT FACT. WE HAVE TO ACT ON WHAT IS IN THE BILL TODAY WHICH WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THAT WORKERS CAN RETURN TO WORK SEAMLESSLY WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. AND YOU KNOW TO THE TO THE OF PROPOSITIONS POINTS IF I COULD IS A TRUST THOSE. I AM COMMITTED TO AMENDING THE BILL TO ALLOW FOR SIMULTANEOUS CONDITIONAL OFFERS WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO EXTEND OFFERS TO MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES THE SAME TIME. THAT'LL HELP GET WORKERS BACK. TO WORK AS WELL AS ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES REOPEN MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. TO THE COMMENT FROM THE CHAMBER ABOUT THIS JUST ABOUT PROTECTING UNION JOBS YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS I SAID THIS BILLS ALWAYS ABOUT WORK PROTECTIONS RESPONSE-GOVERNORS EIGHTEEN WE HAD ON PAID LEAVE PROTECTIONS WE HAD BASICALLY BEEN THE BILL FROM DAY ONE THE CHAMBER TO OPPOSE EVERY SINGLE PROVISION NOW THAT THIS IS ALL THAT WE HAVE OF BOB LET US BE TRANSPARENT I WAS REALLY GOING ON HERE AND THAT IS THE CHAMBER DOES WANT ANY ASPECT OF THIS BILL AND NEVER HAS. AND NOW THAT WE DO HAVE THIS ONE REMAINING ITEM OF I TO RECALL AND WRITE A RETENTION LEFT THEY'RE NOW SAYING IT'S A BILL TO PROTECT UNION ALTHOUGH THESE PROVISIONS APPLY TO ALL WORKERS NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY A UNION BUT AGAIN I THINK LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED A ALONG THE WAY- AND YOU KNOW THE WRITER RECALL RIGHT A RETENTION IS NOTHING NEW SANTA MONICA BY RETENTION LOS TWO THOUSAND ONE THAT IT'S INSPIRED BY RETENTION A LOT FROM DC IN THE NINETIES LA A LONG BEACH A PASSABLE ORDINANCES WELL- FIFTEEN THE LEADERSHIP. OF A DISTINGUISHED JOINT AUTHORS THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY GONZALEZ FLETCHER PASSWORD RETENTION OFFER GROCERY WORKERS WHICH IS NEARLY% IDENTICAL TO THE RECORD RETENTION PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. SO THE LAW WILL SURVIVE THE GO CHALLENGE. ARGUING THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION THE CONTRAST BECAUSE- IF THE IF THE STATE HAS A SIGNIFICANT LEGITIMATE PURPOSE BEHIND A LOT WHICH WE DO. WHICH IS REMEDYING ABROAD AND GENERAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO IN OTHER WORDS THE COURTS WILL DIFFER. FROM LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT IF THERE'S A RATIONAL BASIS FOR ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL REGULATION AND THIS CASE IS NO QUESTIONS A RATIONAL BASIS. FOR THESE WORKER PROTECTIONS. AND FINALLY ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON THAT ISSUE IT IS AN ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE. FOR US TO GIVE SOMEONE A RIGHT AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO ENFORCE IT IS TANTAMOUNT TO GETTING NO RIGHT AT ALL. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WORKERS WILL BENEFIT MAYBE THIRTY TO SIXTEEN ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS WOMEN AND LOW WAGE WORKERS. REMOVING THE BY RIGHT OF ACTION POTENTIALLY SYSTEMS AND INSTITUTIONS. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGES FOLKS. FOR THE MORE LIVING ENFORCEABLE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WOULD BE UNBEARABLE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS BACKLOADED. WAGE CLAIMS. AS WE WAGE CLAIM FROM THE FILING TO HEARING IS TO HUNDRED AND NINETY. DAYS WORKERS NEED ACCESS TO JUST. AND THAT'S WHAT. ONE THE PRIVATE I WRITE ABOUT LIMITED. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THE WITHOUT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THE ABILITY OF WORKERS TO ENFORCE. THEIR RIGHTS IS IN REALITY NON EXISTENT. AND SO YOU KNOW PLEASE KNOW THAT I'M WITH BERMAN COMMITTED ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH IN THE PAST. POSSIBLE WAYS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT STILL PROTECT WORKERS AT A DOCTOR PUMPED THE- CONCERNS. OF THE PAST INSTANCE EARNS REGARDING THE DEFINITION JOHN HAWKINS ON WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT AS WELL OUR ECONOMY CANNOT RECOVER WITHOUT ITS WORKERS ARE ITS LIFEBLOOD LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PAIN TO DETERMINE THE SOLUTION THAT BEST BELIEVES THAT PAIN. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER KALRA- AS YOU KNOW I'VE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL AND SPECIFICALLY THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PART HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND I STILL BELIEVE-THAT THE ENFORCEMENT BY THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IS IN WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. I DO THINK THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND THIS PARTICULAR CASE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE UNNECESSARY LIVING CAN ABUSE FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTE. ON THIS BILL TODAY. FROM JACKSON. OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MEMBERS PLEASED ON YOUR MY SONORA CAST VOTE CENTER HILL NO SENATOR HILL NO SENATOR MORALE. SENATOR JACKSON JACKSON HI SENATOR JACKSON HI SENATOR MITCHELL MITCHELL ALL RIGHT SENATOR MITCHELL HI CENTER PAM HI CENTER PAN HI. I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL ON CALL FOR THE ACTION MEMBER AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH KALRA SURE IS IT. MISTER COOPER WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES DRIVING BEFORE COCKETTES STARCH BUT WE WILL TAKE YOUR BILL TO CONCLUSION- AND APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE V. ITEM THREE I'M SORRY BE SIX SIXTY FOUR. PLEASE FOR STEVEN CHOI COOPER FRAZIER THE TEARS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME TO HAVE THIS BILL SB SIX SIX FORCE CRAFTED TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THAT COVER NINETEENTH. AT SEVEN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. FIREFIGHTERS HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND PEACE OFFICERS. LITERALLY THOUSANDS THESE FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IN QUARANTINE DO THIS PANDEMIC AND SADLY MANY OF LOS OUR LIFE'S. PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE DIFFERENT. THEY'VE ALL TAKEN PROFESSIONAL AND LEGALS THAT NOT ONLY REQUIRE THEM TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. DURING A CRISIS. BOB PRICE COULD GIVE ME LIKE THIS REPLY TO IT AND DANGER AND OR- TO FACE IT HEAD ON. THEIR PLACE IN THE CITY. THERE WAS THE REQUIRED TO ENFORCE STAY IN PLACE. BUSINESS SHUTDOWNS IN OVERRUN WORKPLACES WITH HUNDREDS OF AFFECTED PATIENTS. THEY DO SO WILLINGLY EVEN AT THE RISK OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY. THEY'RE ALSO DIFFERENT BECAUSE DURING A CRISIS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DON'T GET TO CHOOSE THEIR ASSIGNMENTS. THE STAFFING SHORTAGES DUE TO INJURY INFECTION STORE EMPLOYEES ARE MOVED AROUND WHAT DATA DESK THE NEXT IN THE FIELD OR IN THE ICU FACING THE DANGER HEAD ON.

FIVE I LIKE TO THINK MISTER FIRST FULL AND TAKING OVER MR DONALD A YOU CAN'T BE THERE. ARE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CHARTER SCHOOL THAT PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THIS WILL TRACK THE MOST COMPETENT SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE TO BUILD THE SCHOOLS. THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY DID THIS FOR ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL DUTY CONDO ON. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. HOW DO A BUNDLE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS TO UTILIZE THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO BUY BONDS TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION. ALLOWING THEM TO SAVE MONEY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS. YOU LIVE IN THE TAXPAYERS BY READING ON THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET WE BELIEVE THAT THE TAXPAYER INVESTMENT IN A PRIVATE PROJECT. THE ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB TWENTY. HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS AND THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO ENSURE THAT ANY WORK BEING PAID FOR BY PROCEEDS FROM CONDUIT BOND SHOULD THEREFORE GO TOWARD PROVIDING A LIVING WAGE. WITH BENEFITS WERE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BUILDING THE PROJECT THAT THE BOND FUND AND THEIR FAMILIES. UNDERBELLY WHICH PROVIDES TAKE HOME PAY THAT HAS LITTLE CLASS. DOUBLE HEALTH AND WELFARE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN A PENSION. FOR THE WORKERS WHO OFTEN HAVE TO RETIRE EARLIER THAN MOST BECAUSE OF THE- HOW HARD THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS THIS IS A BILL THAT. SERVER THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS. BY ENSURING THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WITH MIDDLE CLASS WAGES- THAT WILL HELP THEM WHETHER THE CURRENT RECESSION SHOULD THE CHARTER SCHOOL INDUSTRY VOLUNTARILY DECIDE TO PURSUE FUNDING. FELL WITHIN AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY USING HIGHLY SKILLED INDIAN WORKERS ON THESE PROJECTS. CHARTER SCHOOL DEVELOPERS WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY BY HAVING THEIR PROJECT FINISHED ON TIME. AND UNDER BUDGET WHAT'S YOUR CHANGE ORDERS OR CONSTRUCTION DELAYS CONSTRUCT WORKERS THE WAGE GRADUATES. OF THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. YEAH HIGH SKILL INCOME. BELPER MONEY ON BACK. FINALLY BELIEVE THAT A TAXPAYER DOLLARS OR A PUBLIC BENEFIT GOES TO BUILD ANYTHING THAT'S RECESSION WHEN EVERY DOLLAR OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO BE SPENT WISELY THAT TAXPAYERS WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE EIGHT MIDDLE CLASS WAGES BUT- THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHERE I ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH WE WILL NOW. GO TO THOSE IN OPPOSITION I SEE NO LEAD. OPPOSITION SPEAKER SO WE WILL NOW GO TO THE TELECONFERENCE RESEARCHER YES. STRUCTURE I'M SO SORRY YES I AM CARLOS FORGET YOUR ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION I AM THE LEAD OPPOSITION AND I'M SORRY I DID NOT HAVE YOU HERE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR- REMINDING US OF THAT. SO PLEASED TO PROCEED YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES. A NOT A WORRY THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF- CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION- I'M HERE TO SERVE AS LEAD OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE. WHILE FEET YET THEY GENERALLY SUPPORT THE PROPONENT STATED INTENT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FUNDING BE MADE MORE SUSTAINABLE WE DISAGREE THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE WILL ACHIEVE THAT INTENT- AND- I'M LIKE DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOL DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS ARE WITHDRAWN FROM THE SAME FUND USED TO PAY FOR. CRITICAL STUDENT SERVICES AND TEACHER SALARIES GIVEN THE STATE'S CHALLENGING TECHNICAL OUTLOOK FURTHER ENCROACHMENT ON THE ALREADY STRAINED OUT. BUDGET THE PUBLIC'S IT ADVISED AT THIS TIME. FURTHER FOR CLOSING ON COST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO OUR FACILITIES PROGRAM OF LAST RESORT FOR CHARTERS AT A TIME WHEN ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE GRAPPLING WITH NECESSARY SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. WILL ONLY SERVE TO APPLY EVEN GREATER PRESSURE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE EQUITABLE SPACE AVAILABLE AS CHARTERS ARE REQUIRED- TO HAVE ACCESS TO UNDER PROP THIRTY NINE. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING CALLS TO IMPOSE THE MORATORIUM ON PROP THIRTY NINE LEASES AND EVEN EVICTING EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM DISTRICT THE SAUDIS TO ACCOMMODATE NEW SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. AND SINCE SO FEW LOCAL BONDS GRANT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CHARTERS. AND THE MODERNIZE STATE BOND. PROGRAM FAILED TO THIS MARCH. AND WE SUPPORTED. PROGRAM LIKE THE KIND OF WHAT ACT. ACT AS A PRESSURING VALVE ON. CAMPUS THAT CURRENTLY HOUSE BOTH DISTRICT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE CONDUIT BOND PROGRAM DOES NOT INVOLVE PUBLIC FUNDS. AS THE PROPONENTS HAVE STATED. AND AS CLARIFIED IN GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S VETO MESSAGE ON IDENTICAL LANGUAGE LAST YEAR.% THE STATE ABSORBS NO RISK BECAUSE THE STATE TREASURER'S INTERCEPT PACKAGES AND CAPTURES A RECIPIENT SCHOOL ANNUAL APPORTIONMENT AUTOMATICALLY. IF THIS PROGRAM IS COST PROHIBITIVE WE DO WORRY THAT SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS HE TO FINANCE THE PROJECT ON THE PRIVATE MARKET WITHOUT THE SAME RIGOROUS PUBLIC VETTING. AND DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS THAT THE SFA REQUIRES WHICH PROTECTS AGAINST CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES AND ENSURES THE RECIPIENT SCHOOL IS SUSTAINABLE. FINALLY GSA WAS PROUD TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION LAST YEAR IN HELPING ENACTED HISTORIC OVERHAUL TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. YES HE IS HOPEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL ALLOW SOME TIME FOR CHARTERS TO FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE. BEFORE LEGISLATING YOUR REQUIREMENTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. AFTER THESE RECENT CDS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE IS TO KNOW ABOUT.

THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES BUT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU HI I DO NOT SEE ANOTHER MEMBER HERE SO I THINK. I'M SURE YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO GO VERY GOOD THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE PLEASE PROCEED YOU CAN DO FROM THERE IF YOU'D LIKE. HE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT BYE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE IS SPONSORED BY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND WOULD PROTECT DOMESTIC WORKERS FROM BEING FORCED TO WORK IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY WILDFIRES SPECIFICALLY AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT WOULD EXTEND EXISTING PROTECTIONS AGAINST EMPLOYER RETALIATION FOR EMPLOYEES TO REFUSE TO WORK AND HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS DO. CONDITIONS TO DOMESTIC WORKERS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT ALSO STATES THAT AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE OF EVACUATION A PERSON SHALL BE GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR THAT THEY NOT ONLY DIRECTED EMPLOYEE TO ENTER OR REMAIN IN AN AREA CALLED DO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THREATS. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO AVOID SITUATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE WE HAVE WITNESSED IN PAST YEARS WERE DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE SEEN HEADING TOWARDS THE EVACUATED HOMES URROUNDED IN CLOUDS OF TOXIC SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES. IN ONE INSTANCE A WORKER WAS DIRECTED TO REMAIN INTHE HOME IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT. THAT WORKER THEN BECAME TRAPPED INSIDE THE DANGEROUS AREA FOR OVER A WEEK. SOME OF THE WORKERS INTERVIEWED IN THE NEW STORY STATED THAT THEY FEARED RETALIATION IF THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK DESPITE THE HAZARDOUS. CONDITIONS THIS MEASURE WOULD ALLEVIATE THAT FEAR AND CREATE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE BY PROVIDING PROTECTION FROM EMPLOYER RETALIATION FOR REFUSING TO WORK IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE THERE IS NOTHING IN CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE THAT CLEARLY AND EXPRESSLY PREVENTS A DOMESTIC WORKER FROM ORDERING A DOMESTIC WORKER TO REMAIN IN A MANDATORY EVACUATION ZONE SKEWS ME AT DOMESTIC EMPLOER FROM ORDERING A DOMESTIC WORKER. THIS ISSUE WAS HIGHLIGHTED CURRENTLY BY THE PRESENCE OF COVERT NINETEEN UNDER CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR NINE POINT FIVE OF A CALAMITY CREATES AN IMMEDIATE MENACE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ARE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE THE AREA WHEN THE MINNIS EXISTS. THE FOOTBALL GAME PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WERE TO DO SO IN THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT DOMESTIC WORKERS FROM BEING COMPELLED TO ENTER SUCH AREAS. FOR AGAINST FOR REFUSING TO WORK IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN THE LABOR CODE FOR MANY WORKERS AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THIS PROTECTION IS ALSO MADE AVAILABLE. TO DOMESTIC WORKERS. DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR LIVES AND ARE WORTHY OF THE VERY SAME PROTECTIONS WE PROVIDED. TO EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIA WORKER.

NINETY TWO. ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER I'D LIKE THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND EXISTING PROTECTED LEAVE TO VICTIMS OF ANY VIOLENT CRIME. AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TWO ALLOWS LEAVE ONLY FOR LIMITED PURPOSES WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LEASE TERMINATION PROTECTION PROPOSED. IN A NUMBER OF SENATE BILL SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY THAT ARE REFERENCED IN TODAY'S COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB ELEVEN NINETY ALLOWS AN ELIGIBLE SURVIVOR TO BREAK A LEASE FOLLOWING A CRIME. WHERE IS THIS BILL AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TWO WHAT ONLY AUTHORIZED UNPAID LEAVE FOR ELIGIBLE SURVIVORS. IF THE LEAVES SPECIFICALLY TO ACCEPT TO ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE MEDICAL CARE VICTIM SERVICES SAFETY PLAN OR TO OBTAIN A PROTECTIVE OR RESTRAINING ORDER. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE CONTENTS OF THESE BILLS ARE INDEED DIFFERENT. THE NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH UNPAID LEAVE IS ALLOWABLE IN AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TWO FURTHER LIMITS ELIGIBILITY FOR LEAVE WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM SB ELEVEN NINETY AND MAKES ELIGIBILITY MUCH NARROWER. THAN FOR TENANT PROTECTIONS THE OTHER BILL. SB ELEVEN NINETY ALSO APPLIES TO MEET FAMILY MEMBERS OF LIVING VICTIMS WHEREAS THIS BILL AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TWO DOES NOT. CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE CONDUCTED A STATEWIDE POLL OF SURVIVORS OF CRIME IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE SURVEY FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR CALIFORNIA SURVIVORS HAD TO MISS WORK FOLLOWING THE CRIME. AND TWO OUT OF THREE REPORTED EXPERIENCING ANXIETY STRESS AND DIFFICULTY WITH SLEEPING. RELATIONSHIPS OR WORK. STEADY'S CONSISTENTLY HAVE SHOWN THAT SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIMES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME SURVIVORS OVERWHELMINGLY NEED SUPPORT MEETING BASIC NEEDS FOLLOWING THE CRIME INCLUDING MAINTAINING STABLE EMPLOYMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE CAN TAKE LIMITED TIME OFF TO SECURE THEIR SAFETY AND HEALING FOLLOWING A CRIME. NO ONE TOLD ME WHO'S BEEN A VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL SAFETY AND THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF LOSING LOSING THEIR JOB. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TO EXPAND EXISTING PROTECTED UNPAID LEAVE TO VICTIMS OF ANY VIOLENT CRIME AND TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO EXPAND ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF DOCUMENTATION THAT VICTIM CAN PROVIDE TO TAKE PROTECTED LEAVE FROM WORK OR REQUEST REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO RECOVER FOLLOWING A CRIME. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TWO DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE AMOUNT OF LEAVE CURRENTLY ALLOWABLE IT ONLY EXPANDS THIS PROTECTION TO ADDITIONAL FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME.

PLEASE REFER AT YOUR CONVENIENCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS. MEMBERS OF YOUR WHERE THERE'S A HUGE SHORTAGE SHORTAGE OF LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND PRACTITIONERS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS HAS GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME AND NOW IT'S MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. AB TWENTY ONE ONE FOUR SIMPLY PROVIDES MINIMUM EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES TO WORK. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYER REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY. THESE EMPLOYEES TO WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO GET THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR LICENSEE ARE NOT AFFORDED BASIC RIGHTS INCLUDING DUE PROCESS REGARDING TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR DISCIPLINE. A DISCIPLINE OR TERMINATION THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF SOMETHING MINR THAT UNRELATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE OR LICENSE ACADEMICS. BECAUSE ONGOING CROSSES AND HEALTH CARE TODAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MINOR SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS DON'T HARM THE FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROFESSIONALS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TODAY. THESE WORKS HAS SPENT MANY YEARS LEARNING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY AND SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS ON MINOR MATTERS CAN MEAN WHETHER THEIR ENTIRE CAREER IS OVER OR WHETHER THEY CAN BE LICENSE TO PRACTICE. TO ME THE TIME OF THE BILL MAKES GREAT SENSE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S A LINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT. EARLIER THIS YEAR TO FAST TRACK THE HEALTHCARE WORKER DURING PIPELINE DURING THIS PANDEMIC.

CALAVERAS KRITIS YOU DID NOT OF THE PROFESSIONAL SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS IN GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS BUT A LOT YOU MONTHS NOW WE OFFER A PATH TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ALREADY AND CAN'T THINK ARBITRATION ON SOME MATTERS. I THINK DEFINING CLARIFY ACADEMIC. MATTERS IN THE BILL. THE BILL SHOULD HE BE OF THE DUAL NAY OF MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND INTERNS. THEY'RE BOTH OF VALUE TO WORK FORCE FOR OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AROUND TE STATE. I KNOW ALSO OUR STUDENTS. FAISON ACADEMIC PROGRAM TYPICALLY THE FINAL STEP IN A MEDICAL DOCTORS EDUCATION BEFORE BECOMING LIFE. AND BOARD CERTIFIED. UNIVERSITY WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES THE ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE JIMMY OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE RESIDENCY. THIS IS AN ACADEMIC DECISION NOT UNEMPLOYMENT MISSION IT'S A REQUIREMENT OF OUR NATIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS IN CRITICAL FOR PATIENT SAFETY. BY THE WAY YOU FEEL TOWARDS OUR GRADUATE MEDICAL STUDENT OR RESIDENT NETWORK AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ALREADY WHICH HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED BY THE COURT AND ARE REQUIRED AGAIN BY ACCREDITATION AND OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH- THE RESIDENT THREE INTERNS. BUT ENGINE HAVE MULTIPLE OP. TO THE- IN ORDER AVOID ANY. REACHED THIS IN MAKING. KNOW ADVERSE DECISIONS OR SIGNIFICANT- ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS. ARE MADE BY A SINGLE FACULTY MEMBER ALONG. WITH WHY THESE ISSUES SHOULD REMAIN AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. BUT THE UNIVERSITY ALSO NEED TO ENSURE OUR ACADEMIC PHYSICIANS IN THE GRADUATE STUDENT WHEN NECESSARY. ENSURE THAT THEIR ADVANCEMENT IS BASED ON A VALUATION ANY ACADEMIC GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM. NOT BASED ON EMPLOYMENT. FOR TO ENSURE SAFE NOT HOW WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR. ANOTHER STAFF AND THAT NOT TO SAY THERE'S NO PLACE ARBITRARY. BUT WE BELIEVE IT CLEARLY DRAWN A LINE AROUND ACADEMIC DECISIONS DO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS AND APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL SIGNALED. BUT IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT YET. UNIVERSITY THE STATE'S LEADING MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAINING INSTITUTION OPPOSED TO TRYING TO DECISIONS OVER WITHOUT. A CARD.

MODIFICATION THAT THEY'RE SEEKING IS- THAT YOU SEE WITH THAT I GUESS ADVANCE WHAT THEY CALLED VANCE AND MAYBE PERHAPS YOU SEE CLARIFIES ADVANCEMENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR OR IS THAT COMPLETION DECLARATION COMPLETION. WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN ACADEMIC MATTER. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT PERHAPS IS IT OKAY TO.

YOU HAVE TO I JUST WANT TO GET TO ANOTHER OF WHAT YOU TOLD THE COMMITTEE AND- AGAIN IF I'M WRONG PLEASE. SO YOU I HEARD YOU SAY WHAT IS THAT. IF ADVANCEMENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS AN ACADEMIC MATTER WHICH IN THIS BILL WOULD THEREFORE MAKE IT YOU KNOW NOT OUTSIDE OF- VIA DUE PROCESS. THANK THEN YOU WOULD REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION IS THAT CORRECT OR DID I HEAR COULD INCORRECTLY. JANET RAP WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH A HIGH. THE NEW UNION OFFICER.

TO PREPARE THEM FOR PRACTICE AND- SO CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- SOME OF UC'S CONCERNS. BUT THE SAME TIME I ALSO NOTE THAT- ALL RESIDENTS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES- TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS- THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THE REASON THEY GET PAID IS BECAUSE THEY'RE FOR DELIVERING VALUABLE CLINICAL SERVICES AND CLINICAL SERVICES THAT. NAY THIS POSITIONS NOT ONLY THE LIVER BUT WE ACTUALLY TRAIN THEM TO BE ADVOCATES THE NEED TO BE ADVOCATES FOR THE PATIENTS WHEN YOU SEE A DOCTOR. YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT DOCTORS CAN BE ADVOCATING FOR YOU AND THAT'S PART OF THAT TRAINING AND SOCIALIZATION HAPPENS DURING RESIDENCY. AND WE NEED TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN DURING RESIDENCY. AND ALSO THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR DOING THAT AND SOMETIMES THAT MAKES THE INSTITUTION UNCOMFORTABLE. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND I KNOW THAT- YEAH I'VE SEEN HOUSE STAFF- UNIONS AT COLLECTED WORKS. HAVE HAVE OFTEN. TAKEN ON THESE ISSUES IS BEING PART OF NOT JUST ABOUT WELL WHAT OUR OWN PAY AND SALARY SO FOR THE TALKED ABOUT THE WORKING CONDITIONS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT PATIENT CARE. AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT THEY HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS. SO WITH THAT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY SAT ON THE SB SIX WHAT THE OTHER SIDE I DON'T LIKE TO THINK OF TWO SIDES GETTING WE HAVE OUR VALUES ARE TO. PROVIDE TO FIGURE HOW TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT PATIENT CARE. THAT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE PROVIDE THESE BASIC PROTECTIONS FOR RESIDENTS NOW I WOULD ENCOURAGE- THE AUTHOR AND ALSO YOU MAY BE IF WE CAN TRY TO CLARIFY. AND BILL DISAPPOINTED I THOUGHT YOU SEE HAD SAID THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THIS ONE LAST THING WHICH I THINK IS RESOLVABLE IT SOUNDS LIKE NOW THERE'S A PACKAGE. THAT SO- SO OF THOSE- BUT- YOU KNOW THIS BILL DOES CLEARLY SAY AND I REALIZE THERE MAY BE SOME INTERPRETATION WISHES THAT ACADEMIC MATTERS AND I APPRECIATE THAT- SPONSORS BUT THE SENATE. ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL MATTERS. ARE NOT FAR OUTSIDE. OF THIS SO THEY RECOGNIZE THIS DUAL ROLE OF THE RESIDENTS THAT WAS PENSION. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL DOES. RECOGNISE THIS. YEAH IT'S NOT THAT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO THE LINE. BUT I DO BUT- THE IT'S IMPORTANT WE PROVIDE THESE PROTECT. AND SO CERTAINLY I AM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SPELLING BEE HAVING TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND I ENCOURAGE THOSE CONTINUING A DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOU SEE AND THE- SPONSORS OF THIS BILL- AND TRYING TO SEE WHERE THEY CAN TRY TO FINE TUNE- SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUE MIL FORD. AND IN THE END PROVIDE. DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY FOR MATTERS RELATED RELATING TO- THE WORK. PLACE CONDITIONS. AND ALSO THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE BOTH FOR THEMSELVES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THEIR PATIENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU DR PAN SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I TO HAVE BEEN. ANGUISHING OVER THIS BILL AND- I MAY NOT BE TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING. WHAT THE ISSUES ARE SO IF MICHAEL YOU'RE STILL ON THE PHONE IF YOU COULD. ASSIST FIRST OF ALL WHAT I HEARD IS THAT IF YOU COULD RESOLVE THIS ADVANCEMENT ISSUE. THAT YOU HAVE RESOLVED A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES AS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT TO GO SHE ATION. SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD YOU SAYING IS THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED. AND THAT HAVE A UPON BY BOTH PARTIES THAT THIS ISSUE OF ADVANCEMENT IS THE ONLY REMAINING- ISSUES IS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT IS CORRECT SENATOR OKAY SO SENATOR PAN I DO I THINK THERE WAS A CONFUSION THERE THAT IF THIS ISSUE CAN GET RESOLVED THE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY RESOLVED THAT THERE THAT TOSE ARE ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WILL OFF THE TABLE NOW IS THAT RIGHT MICHAEL. YEAH THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MISS CASTRO THIS MORNING. ALL RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT ON EVERYTHING BUT THIS ONE ISSUE I'M NOT SURE I'M REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS YEAR'S BUT PERHAPS I CAN GET TO IT BY ASKING A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS ONE. IS THE POSITION THE UNIVERSITY HAD TAKEN IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER IN ORDER TO RETAIN. THEIR ACCREDITATION IS THAT ACCURATE OR IS THAT OF CONCERN IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY CREATE A PROBLEM OR IS IT CLEAR THAT IT WILL CREATE A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSITY MAINTAINING ITS NATIONAL ACCREDITATION. HI YEAH THIS IS MICHAEL AGAIN THROUGH THE STATE YOU CAN ONLY GO BASED ON- YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL AND BURNS THE MEDICAL EDUCATION. REQUIRES AGAIN THIS IS A QUORUM REQUIREMENT FROM ACGME. IT SAYS THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS OF OUR- YOU KNOW OUR ACADEMIC POSITION MUST HAVE RESPONSIBILITY I'M READING FROM THEIR REQUIREMENTS. YOU MUST HAVE RESPONSIBILITY SORRY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SOME OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THE EVALUATION AND PROMOTION OUR RESIDENTS. AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION. THE OPRAH MARKERS. WE KNOW AS I UNDERSTAND FROM TALKING TO OUR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION DEAN- WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER OUR ACCREDITATION TO CONTINUE HAVING THAT DIRECT. DIRECT FEEDBACK ON THE VALUATION OF THE PROMOTIONAL DANCED IN A RESIDENTS GROUP GME PROGRAM IN OUR FEAR NOW ONE OF THE FEARS IS THAT THE ONE AB TWO ONE ONE FOUR COULD RESULT IN AN ARBITRATOR OVERTURNING OR NAVIGATION OVERTURNING. AN ACADEMIC JOHN. AND THAT COULD LEAD TO ADDRESS OUTCOMES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. ALL RIGHT AND HOW DOES THIS ADVANCEMENT- A CONCEPT THAT THE SENATOR PAN WAS TALKING ABOUT IMPACT THAT SITUATION. SURE WE HAVE SHARED LANGUAGE WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WHAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR DOCTORS TO CLARIFY THE ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL MATTERS WHICH IS IN THE NOBEL MEANS THOSE MATTERS THAT RELATE TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ADVANCEMENT BROUGH. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE ADDING LANGUAGE WAY ACQUISITION OF CORE COMPETENCIES IN A JAMMY PROGRAM. SO THIS WAY WE CAN. OUR DATA IS TO PROVIDE OPTION FOR ARBITRATION NEXT WE ALREADY HAVE ARBITRATION OPTIONS TO OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THAT MAKING SURE THAT A RESIDENT DOESN'T COMPETING YEAR OR DOESN'T COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM THROUGH ARBITRATION BUT THROUGH MEETING ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF THE IF THE CENTER PAN HAS ANY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT MY OTHER CONCERN. IS THIS NOTION OF RETALIATION- WHEN IS SOMETHING A YEAR- AN ACADEMIC MATTER AND WHEN IS IT NOT SO LET US SAY THAT WE HAD A STUDENT YOU HAVE A STUDENT- WHO IS EXPRESSING SOME CONCERN AND CONSTERNATION ABOUT THE LACK OF THE STATE PPVS OR A PROTOCOL BEING USED WITH COLVIN. AND CHALLENGED US SOME DECISION- THERE IS A POSSIBILITY I DON'T KNOW HOW LIKELY IT WOULD BE BUT CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT PERSON COULD AND SHOP FOR A RETALIATION. BOB HIS SUPERVISOR I FELT THAT THEY WERE ADELINE. THEY SHOULD THE SAID THAT THAT THAT THAT WASN'T APPROPRIATE WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE OFFERED SO THAT IF THERE IS SUCH A CHALLENGE TO THE POWERS THAT BE. THAT THERE WOULD BE IN PLACE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT A DOCTOR THAT DOCTOR OBJECTING TO A PROCEDURE OR PROCESS GOING ON. WOULD BE PROTECTED FROM AN ACT OF RETALIATION BY THOSE SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT ACADEMIC. AND THAT THE REQUESTED WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY HAS THAT EACH OF OUR- FIVE GMT LAW PROGRAMS- EXTENSIVE HANDBOOKS AND- RALPH AND AS I SAID DO YOU PROCESS THAT IN A- BY THE COURTS AND AS WE- BY A ACCREDITATION. TO HANDLE THESE MATTERS AGAIN NO SINGLE PERSON AND- SIGNIFICANTLY DISAPPOINTED- RESIDENTS ARE IN TURN BY THEMSELVES INCLUDING FOR ALLEGE RETALIATION. YES MATTERS AVAILABLE FOR D. OR PANELS OF THESE AND OTHER- UNDER- NOT. NOT. CONNECTED PARTY SOMETIMES ARE YOU READY THAN AND I FEEL YEAH. I ALSO ISSUES AROUND. AND RETALIATES OF WORK SAFETY ARE MATTERS THAT CAN BE PRETTY COMPANY HANDLED AT OSHA. IF THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA. SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO ROLE FOR THE UNION TO COME IN AND TO REPRESENT THAT INDIVIDUAL IN ONE OF THESE APPELLATE ACTIONS OR NOT THIS IS REALLY TECHNICALLY APPELLATE BUT IN AN APPEAL PROCEEDING. WITH THAT WHAT. WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE APPROPRIATE. WELL I'M NOT SAYING THAT RETALIATES I DON'T THINK OPPOSITION THAT LET YOUR TELEVISION ON THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL SHOULDN'T GO TO ARBITRATION AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER A PATH WHERE WE THINK ITEMS COULD GO TO ARBITRATION WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACADEMIC. DECISION MAKING IS MORE CLEARLY AND SQUARELY DEFINED IN THE STATUTE. BUT BUT WOULD YOU LET MY LAST QUESTION I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR BUT- ARE YOU SUGGESTING THEN THAT SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE BEING- DENIED. THE ABILITY TO CAN TO ADVANCE- ON A CLAIM OF ACADEMIC- INFERIOR- ACTIVITY OR YOU KNOW. COMPETENCE OR WHATEVER- THAT IF THEY SAY NO THIS IS IN RETALIATION FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THAT DENIAL OF ADVANCEMENT- IF THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT IT WAS MADE OUT FOR MEDICAL REASONS. BUT THE BUT THE DOCTOR THE- INTERN OF THE INTERNAL YOU KNOW. RECIPIENT IS SAYING BUT I'VE BEEN DIVING COMPANY AND THIS IS JUST RETALIATION WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT PERSON. HOW DO THEY GO AHEAD AND- RESOLVE THAT DISPUTE. AND BE ABLE TO ASSERT THAT CLAIM. CURRENTLY YOU ARE UNDER THE PROPOSAL. WELL WHAT ARE UNDER THE PROPOSAL- WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO DO WITH THAT. IN THIS IN THIS LEGISLATION OR DO YOU FEEL THAT CURRENTLY- THE IT'S PERFECTLY ADEQUATELY TAKEN CARE OFF. I GUESS I WOULD NOT I WOULD NOT IS THAT YOU KNOW HE CONSULTED WITH SOME OF. OUR PRACTITIONERS IN THE SORRY I DON'T REALLY. KNOW THE ENTIRETY OF THE IN THE MOUTH BUT HOW ARE A DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES HANDLE A MATTER LIKE THAT. ONE THAT RETALIATES. CLAIMS WRITTEN OF WHAT THE BLOWER PROTECTION START EXTEND TO A MEDICAL RESIDENT IN TURN. IN THIS CONTEXT- THE EVEN AFTER THE BILL. SO I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT YOU KNOW AREN'T NEEDED UNDER CURRENT LAW TO PROTECT AGAINST RETALIATION AGAINST FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND WHAT THE BLOWER ISSUES IS THINGS ARE. PRETTY EXTENSIVELY UNDERSTOOD AND HANDLED IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH AND I. FEEL CONFIDENT SAYING THAT- THE CURRENT MEDICAL EVIDENCE NATIONALLY COVER. BOTTLES LIKE. I THANK YOU AND PERHAPS US PAN YOU MIGHT ADDRESS OF FOR MY EDIFICATION BECAUSE I'M AT POINT I'M GONNA CHIU STAY OFF THE BILL- RESERVE MY ULTIMATE VOTE- AS THIS GOES FORWARD- BUT THE ISSUE OF ADVANCEMENT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE IS A PATH HERE. FOR SOME AGREEMENT THAT I FRANKLY I'M NOT TOTALLY. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OR WHAT ADVANCEMENT IS AS YOU'RE DEFINING IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE DOCU BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS I'M JUST A CORAL COUNTRY LAWYER- BUT I'D CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ANY GUIDANCE. AND THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. THANK YOU YES SIR CENTER PAN. THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR- I'D- I PREACH MY GOOD FRIEND- CENTER JACKSON'S- SET OF QUESTIONS AND- I GUESS MY- AND I WOULD TRY FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I ACTUALLY AM A PAST MEMBER OF THE ACCREDITATION BODY I SERVED ON THE BOARD FOR THE ACCREDITING COUNCIL GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION WHICH OVERSEES ALL OF RESIDENCY EDUCATION AND UNITED STATES- SO I GUESS I CAN CLAIM SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THEIR POLICIES AND- RULES AND- SO. CERTAINLY I THINK THE- IT IS SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BUT I I'M NOT SURE I ENTIRELY- AGREE WITH THE OPPONENTS IN TERMS OF THE RISKS TO DEGRADATION OF THE UC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS- BUT AGAIN I AM A FORMER MEMBER OF THAT BOARD AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THAT ORGANIZATION AT THIS TIME- YOU KNOW I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION CONTINUES I ONLY HOPED COMMITTEE I'M MOVES OUT TODAY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF WE DON'T THAT THAT THAT CONVERSATION CEASES. MMHM AND THE RESIDENTS ARE ON THE FRONT RIGHT NOW TODAY SO WE PUT IT OFF THEY'RE STILL ON THE FRONT LINES STILL BE TAKEN CARE CO THE PATIENCE YOU KNOW ON UNTIL WHENEVER WE CAN RE YOU KNOW RE EXAMINE THIS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S TIMELY THAT WE ADDRESS THIS- TODAY AND- THIS YEAR- SO I JUST WANT TO PAY THAT. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A BALANCE AND I DO THINK THAT. YOU ARE WORKING TOWARD THAT BALANCE- PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE PERHAPS THE SPONSOR MIGHT WANT TO RESPOND. AND IT SURE YOU CAN TO IN TERMS OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY TO QUESTION YOUR PLANE TO ASK IN TERMS OF DISCUSSION THE COMMITTEE. TO PERHAPS RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT. HE'S CONCERNS OF ADVANCE TERMS OF WHAT THE- DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN- IN RELATION TO. WHAT THE- THERE'S ARE YOU HAVE BEEN WILLING YES THEY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GRANT I KNOW YOU'VE CARVED OUT ACADEMIC BUT IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THE ADVANCEMENT ISSUE THAT YOU SEE HAS POINTED OUT AS BEING THEIR MAIN CONCERN AT THIS POINT. ALSO WITHOUT SAID YOU KNOW MYSELF ALONG WITH THE SPONSOR BEEN WORKING QUITE A BIT WITH OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS WITH OTHER ISSUES. NO FORGERY ARE THERE ARE SOME DISCUSSIONS MAY JUST RECENTLY REGARDING NEGOTIATIONS BUT WE DIDN'T GET THAT LANGUAGE IN TIME TO BE BROUGHT TO TODAY'S COMMISSION- COMMITTEE. BUT LOOK FOR HOPEFULLY THIS BILL GETS OUT THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IT IN THE NEXT ONE- WITHOUT I THINK OUR SPONSOR A MICHELLE. STILL BE ON THE LINE MAYBE CHECK IT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. REGARDING THE THING BEEN IT OUR WAY OF THE OPPOSITE TO COME TO BETTER PLACE WITH SO CASH WITH YOUR THE LINE IF YOU COULD BRING ALONG. RESPOND TO THAT. YES CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY GREAT- SO YEAH WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LAST FEW WEEKS WITH THE UC AND WE MADE SOME PROGRESS. WE HAD A FEW THINGS OUTSTANDING PRIMARILY DEALING WITH TERMINATION AND NON RENEWAL BUT- ABOUT A MEDICAL RESIDENT- AS WELL AS THE BETTER DEFINING ACADEMIC OR CLINICAL MATTERS THE NOTION OF ADVANCEMENT CHESTER ROAD THE PAST WEEKEND- I WAS LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS ADVANCED. FROM YOU SEE THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY AND THE LAST FEW WEEKS NOT TALK AT ALL ABOUT ADVANCEMENT THAT IS A NEW NOTION THAT WAS INTRODUCED. IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS- WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT THOSE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE CHARLIE I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO FULLY DIED THEM TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE COMMANDMENT. SO YOU KNOW WORKING IT TALKING WITH. THEM BUT- THE NOTION OF ADVANCEMENT. A NEW CAR TO US THE ONLY BEEN RATE AND LOCK UP DAYS BUT AGAIN IF WE ARE HAPPY TO TALKING WITH YOU SEE. TO SEE WHAT WE CAN. REPUBLICAN IF I MAY JUST MAKE ONE LESS MARK AND AT FRAZIER CAN THOSE THE WHAT OTHER THING I NOTICED JACKSON AND ASKED ABOUT WELL WHAT ABOUT OTHER. WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK REDRESS ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT AS AS POINTED OUT BY THE TIME AND- THE- RESIDENT IS BOTH SOMEONE WHO'S DELIVERING HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND ALSO SOME OF THE LEARNER WHICH MEANS THERE ARE. ONLY INSTITUTION FOR FIXED AMOUNT OF TIME. SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY FILE A COMPLAINT DO EITHER WAIT THEM OUT. OR BECAUSE OUR TRAINEE- THEY'RE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO BECAUSE LANDS IS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STOPPING SOMEONE'S ADVANCEMENT IT'S NOT JUST THAT SOMEONE GOT A JOB AND THEY'RE NOT PROMOTED. THEY EAT THEY DON'T ADVANCE ESSENTIALLY ANSWER CAREER. I MEAN THIS IS CAREER ENDING A POTENTIALLY SO I THINK WE NEED TO PUT IN CONTEXT- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT SOMEONE COULD FILE A COMPLAINT IF IT TAKES LONGER TO COUPLE YEARS THEY'RE READY TO EITHER DON'T THE PROGRAM ORDER DOWN THE CAREER. I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT TO WHAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT OPTIONS ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS WHEN THEY DO FILE COMPLAINTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PENSIONER MITCHELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PLAN FOR RAISING THAT POINT BECAUSE THE CAREER ENDING ELEMENT ALSO AS I UNDERSTOOD IT GIVEN THE FINITE NUMBER OF RESIDENCES WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS- AS A LEGISLATURE FOR QUITE SOME TIME- EVEN THAT IS CHALLENGING TO EVEN BE ABLE TO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE THEN FIND ANOTHER RESIDENCY. AND AS A INSPIRED HAVE RESIDENCIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEEN STAYING IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN OUR DEARTH OF PHONE POSITIONS COMPARED TO POPULATION WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANYBODY AND SO THAT CAREER ENDING ELEMENT I THINK IS CRITICAL AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION DISCUSSION BECAUSE QUITE HELPFUL FOR GOING SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER REPAIRS WOULD YOU LIKE. YES WITHOUT MUCH. THE DISCO WILL TAKE A LOT AND TAKE. WITH US HOPEFULLY WE THIS AND GET OUT IN A DRAW IT IN THE- COMMITTEE SO WITH OTHER FOR. RIVAL THANKS THANK YOU VERY AND IN I.

BEFORE ANYONE IS FIRED DISMISSED OR DISCIPLINED IN ANY WAY AND- THESE ROOM FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT. ARE IN A REALLY LOUD NEUTRAL PROCESS TO APPEAL SOME OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TODAY BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE DO IT AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE A VOTE IN THE FUTURE UNLESS WE CAN. SOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE REYES TOTAL TO BUT I THEY'VE BEEN. IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE. THE ARBITRATION PROCESS YOU KNOW AGENT REALLY SHOULD BE USED AS A LAST RESORT AS WE KNOW IT. WILL HOPEFULLY WE CAN EXHAUST OTHER AVENUES BEFORE IT TO THAT- AND IT REALLY MUST BE LIMITED TO THOSE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND YOU KNOW NON CLINICAL AND- ACADEMIC BASIS THE- PANEL. BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A UC SELECTED AND AN EMPLOYEE SELECTED REPRESENTATIVE AND I DON'T THAT HASN'T BEEN. THE CASE SO FAR AND AS WAS MENTIONED. THE ISSUE RELATED TO DEFINITIONS AROUND ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL MATTERS- AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION HOW THAT'S DEFINED IS- I. IN STRICTLY DIVINE DEFINED- AND WHAT ACTIONS CAN BE CHALLENGED NEEDS TO BE REALLY I THINK SPECIFIED A LITTLE MORE SO. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT AND- AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT- WEAKER SO WE CAN GET TO SOME RESOLUTION ON THIS SHOW THAT AS- DR PAN MENTION THIS IS CRITICAL THIS IS IMPORTANT THIS IS TIMELY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE- HOPEFULLY WILL BE I'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT ONLY GETS TO THE FLOOR SHOW UP. AND WE HAVE A MORE I BELIEVE BY SEN PAN. SO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WHILE I'M THRILLED THAT MANDATE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EATING LIKE A VIABLE SOLUTION IN FACT IT COULD UNDERMINE THE VERY PURPOSE.

EXCEED TWO MINUTES A KNOW YOU STORE IN TWO THE SINCE. SO THEM. TRYING TO CO SPONSOR HIS MEASURE HAS HIGHLIGHTED BY SENATOR HILL. OBVIOUSLY STUDENTS TO BE DONE AS MOST OF THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY IS REQUIRED TO STAY HOME TO WORKERS OVER PART OF THE WORK IS IDENTIFIED BY SEVERAL INSTANCES SERVICE WORKERS. YOU KNOW I'M I'M HEARD JUST WANTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY FROM A VARIETY OF EMPLOYER AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE YOU KNOW I KEEP HEARING IS THAT THEY- THEY CAN'T DO IT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE IT'S COST PROHIBITIVE THERE'S TOO MANY CHALLENGES. AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S TOUCH OUR NEWLY UNFAIR AND TO BE HONEST NOT NOT ACCURATE- IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS WOULDN'T FILED OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. DILLON AT 30% DECREASE IN OVERALL WORKERS COMP CLAIMS ON THE STREETS BECAUSE WORKERS HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE I'M CALLING. FROM AIRPORT TO JUNE THERE'S BEEN A CLAIMS SO CLAIMS ARE SIGNIFICANT THAT.

PATIENT WELLNESS ESPECIALLY CONTAGIOUS DISEASES CONSTRUCTORS ARE CONTRACTED AT WORK- IT REALLY DOES PUT A LOT OF BURDEN ON WORKERS TO. PROVE SOMETHING THAT OFTEN CAN'T BE PROVEN THAT MOST WORKERS ARE LEFT WITHOUT THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE UNDER THE LAW THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT NOT JUST BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BETTER FOR WORKERS BECAUSE- WE REALLY DO THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- TEMPORALITY OF ALL THE COULD NOT. CLOSE IMAGE WORKERS FIND THEMSELVES THEY'LL REALLY POINT TO A PRODUCTION LIKE THAT THOSE BUT WONDER POLICY TO PUT IN PLACE SACRAMENTO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE HAD A SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER SINCE JULY FOURTEENTH MOST OF THE COUNTY FROM SOME VERSION OF THE SAME THING WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT. WE ARE BEING ORDERED TO NOT GO OUT. EXPOSE OURSELVES TO THE BUYER FROM ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CDPH COUNTY MONITORING LESS. OFTEN DETAILS WHAT'S DRIVING ELEVATED TRANSMISSION IN EACH COUNTY WHEN THEY DO GET INTO THE CAUSES OF THE SPIKE WHAT PLACE TRANSMISSION IS OFF ASKED OR NEAR THE TOP. SOMETIMES IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER SOMETIMES IT'S AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY BUT- ACTUALLY GOES THAT WORKPLACE EXPOSURE IN MANY CASES REALLY WHAT'S DRIVING THIS PANDEMIC. OF THE ART THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW PARTIALLY REOPENED. THAT MEANS THAT A PRESUMPTION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN A. WORK RELATED. YOUR COMPLEX WITH A RISK. AND THE BLACK ON THE CLERK NOW THE BILL IS OVER FOR. IT DOESN'T GIVE OFFER FOR THOSE K.

THANK YOU AND IN THAT INTERPRETING THE NEXT WANTED LIKE A PRESENTER OKAY TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN PLEASE SO THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN- TO BE PRESENTED BY CENTER HELEN BEHALF OF SOME OF OUR O'DONNELL SENATE BILL WHICH ELECT AGAIN THANK YOU I'M I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER DONALD WHICH CLARIFIES THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY MAY NOT. AMEND ITS CONTRACT WITH CALPERS TO EXCLUDE GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED UNDER THAT CONTRACT. CIVIL SERVANTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THEIR EARNINGS TO THEIR CALPERS PENSIONS. TRUSTING THEIR INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE A SECURE RETIREMENT. MANY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING FIREFIGHTERS PERFORM DANGEROUS AND DEMANDING JOBS. CONFIDENT THAT THEIR PENSION BENEFITS WILL ENSURE A SECURE FUTURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES HOWEVER SOME LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE DECIDED. TO GAMBLE ON A RISKY MODEL THAT DEPRIVES PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF A SECURE RETIREMENT BY AMENDING THEIR CONTRACT. TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES FROM CALPERS BENEFITS. LIMITED ACCESS TO CALPERS ROB CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS OF THE PENSION BENEFITS AND FINANCIAL SECURITY. THEY DESERVE. ADDITIONALLY IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AGENCIES ADOPT THIS MODEL. THE LOSS OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS COULD TO STATE DESTABILIZE THE FUND. IN IN DANGER THE RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN OF A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL. TO ENSURE PUBLIC AGENCIES USUALLY CALPERS AMENDMENT PROCESS AS INTENDED. NOT TO CUT OURS OUT SELECT GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES FROM A SECURE RETIREMENT. TEST ABOUT TESTIFYING ON THE BILL IS CHRISTY BALL. REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS REFUSED IN THE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND I SEE OR WITNESS IS PRESENT IN THE ROOM SO- MISS- MISS BALA PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MA'AM OF COMMITTEE KRISTIE BELL MY HERE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THIS JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS MEASURE DOES NOT DICTATE THE TERMS OR LEVEL OF BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THAT CONTRACT- BUT DOES ENSURE PARITY SO THAT ALL EMPLOYEE CLASSES MAY EARNED A SECURE RETIREMENT. THIS MEASURE DOES ALSO NOT IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO WOOD CLASSIFICATION PLOYS ARE COVERED UNDER INITIAL CONTRACT WITH CALPERS. AND THE MEASURE DOES NOT LIMIT AN AGENCY'S ABILIY TO FURTHER CLARIFY ANY EXISTING EXCLUSIONS IT JUST SIMPLY MAKES CLEAR THAT THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT PROCESS CAN'T BE USED TO UNFAIRLY EXCLUDED ENTIRE CLASS OF WORKERS FROM CALPERS MEMBERSHIP. THIS IS NOT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE THIRTY SEVEN X. SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WE VIEW THIS AS A MEASURE OF PARITY. THIS DOES NOT REMEDY THE INJUSTICE THAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF PLACENTIA BUT FOR CLOTHES IS THAT IN THE FUTURE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR. ALL THE OFFERINGS FOR THE CHAIRMAN FOR PRESENTING AND THE COST TO SHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN. OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY INCLUDING.

I'D LIKE TO BY THAT MY DUTIES IN THE LONG RECORD OF SUPPORTING DEFINED BENEFIT CONTRIBUTIONS AS A WAY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. MY OPPOSITION AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN IS BASED ON AN UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE A DUTY TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE PUBLIC FINANCES.
