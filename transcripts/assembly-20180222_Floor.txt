ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. MEMBERS PLEASE JOIN ME. IN VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION WAS DESIGNATES FEBRUARY AS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH. I AM PROUD OF THE BIPARTISAN WORK THIS BODIES. DONE ALREADY AND CONTINUES TO DO TO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. IT'S NO SECRET WE HAVE A SKILLS GAP IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. WE HAVE RETIRING BABY BOOMERS OUT OF THE SKILLED TRADES. AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR KIDS AND THE TIME IS RIGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. BY SUPPORTING CT. CONSIDER THAT A PERSON WITH THE PLUMBING CERTIFICATES STARTS WITH AN AVERAGE SALARY SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. A WELL THERE MAKES THE IN AN AVERAGE SALARY OF NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IN THESE FIELDS BUT IS NOT JUST THE SKILLED TRADES. IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD ED IT'S. GRAPHIC DESIGN ITS IT AT CYBER ITS ACT TECHNOLOGY. CT SUPPORTS GIVING OPPORTUNITY IN ALL THESE FIELDS TO OUR KIDS IT PREPARES THEM FOR LIFE IT PREPARES THEM FOR COLLEGE PREPARES THEM FOR A CAREER. AND IT'S PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE IN OUR COLLECTIVE FUTURE. THANK YOU AND PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF AC OR ACR ONE SIXTY FOUR. MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS HAVE FUNDING NECESSARY TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS IS A PRIORITY FOR ME. AND I HOPE MANY OF YOU THIS YEAR. AS A TEACHER I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT CT PROGRAMS REDUCE DROPOUT RATES AND ENGAGE STUDENTS. STUDENTS NEED TO MULTIPLE PAST SUCCESS. NOT EVERY JOB REQUIRES A FOR YOUR UNIT UNIVERSITY DEGREE AND WE KNOW NOT EVERY STUDENT IS GOING TO GET. A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY DEGREE. CURRENTLY THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF WELDERS CODERS AND OTHER JOBS THAT REQUIRE TECHNICAL APTITUDE. THIS EFFORT IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS BUT ALSO ECONOMIC SUCCESS THANK YOU MINISTRY. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER BURKE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY FOUR. I'VE HELPED SELECT COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS ON THIS TOPIC AND IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO SEE THAT SEE AND HEAR THE OUTPOURING OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR C. TEAM. THIS YEAR IS ANOTHER CRITICAL BUDGET YOUR FIRST CD BECAUSE IN MANY CASES WITHOUT THE STEADY STREAM OF FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS SIMPLY WOULD JUST WON'T EXIST. THIS FUNDING FOR CTA PROGRAMS ONLY HELP STUDENTS DREAM A POSSIBILITIES FOR THEIR FUTURE AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS BUT IT ALSO CREATES LOCAL BONDS BETWEEN BUSINESS LABOR AND GOVERNMENT THAT CAN LAST GENERATIONS. AT THE STATE I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO REWARD BUSINESS THAT PARTNER WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS THIS NOT ONLY HELPS BUILD A STRONG COMMUNITY BUT IT ALSO CAN HELP DISTRICTS DEVELOP CURRICULUM AND PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH PRE APPRENTICESHIP OR WORK STUDY OPPORTUNITIES. TO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN WORKFORCE. IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY ONE MILLION MIDDLE CLASS JOBS REQUIRE SOLELY A CERTIFICATE THAT CONTINUE. TO REMAIN UNFILLED BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED A PATHWAY FOR CALIFORNIANS GET THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED TO FILL THOSE JOBS. THAT MONEY LAW IS LOST TO THE ECONOMY AND PRODUCTION IN TAX REVENUE AND MONEY LOST IN SOCIAL SERVICES BUT WORSE THAT IS SELF RESPECT THAT WE TAKE AWAY FROM SMART PEOPLE WHO JUST NEED AN OPPORTUNITY. A CHANCE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE AND THAT TO ME IS THE BIGGEST DISSERVICE OF OFF. I AM PROUD TO HAVE WORKED WITH THE TRULY BIPARTISAN GROUP ON THIS ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE SIXTY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY FOUR. THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

MEN SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY FOUR LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING IT FORWARD. AYE AYE. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE CLEARING FEBRUARY AS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH. AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE NEED TO BE MAKING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. A PRIORITY IN OUR STATE. THESE OPPORTUNITIES GIVE STUDENTS ANOTHER CHANCE IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL PATH THAT HELPS THEM TO STAY ENGAGE IN ON A PATH TO SUCCESS. BUT WE MUST DO MORE. IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL HAVE A SHORTAGE OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TECHNICAL WORKERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD OF THIS EFFORT TODAY BUT ALSO PROUD TO JOIN MANY OF THOSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM. IN A BILL THIS YEAR THAT WILL PROVIDE DOLLARS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WHAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THESE RESOURCES TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WAS VERY PROUD THIS PAST YEAR TO ATTEND?
