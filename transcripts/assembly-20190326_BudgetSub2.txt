GET OUT ONCE A YEAR SO TODAY'S THE DAY -- MáS GONNA BE GOING VISITING OUR GOVERNOR LATER ON TALKING ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION SO I THINK DOUBLY -- IMPORTANT THEY BRING THE A LITTLE HANDS OUT TODAY SO THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT -- WE ALL EMBRACE THE ISSUE OF EARLY EDUCATION WE KNOW IT IT IT MAKES IT MEANS SO MUCH. TO GIVE OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS A HEAD START IN SCHOOL AND LIFE AND ABLE TO ADDRESS AS I ALWAYS SAY THE ISSUES OF THE DAY WHETHER IT'S THE EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY. IN ADDRESSING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EARLY EDUCATION IS A PROVEN DIFFERENCE MAKER AND WHERE I'M GONNA BE TALKING TODAY A ABOUT A A RECORD INVESTMENT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET FOR REALLY EDUCATION OF PRIOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE MAY BUDGET WITH -- SOMEWHAT CLOSE AS FAR AS A DOLLAR AMOUNT BUT NEVER THIS MUCH IN THE JANUARY BUDGET SO A LOT OF PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS TO THEY RELATE TO HER. PRESCHOOL ITS EXPANSION FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES WORK FORCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A CERTAINLY A GREAT START I COMMEND HIM FOR HIS FOCUS ON EARLY EDUCATION -- THERE ARE OF COURSE SENSE AND GAPS WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BUILD UPON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO MAKE IT. BETTER -- ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS OF COURSE WE HEAR IS THE USE OF ONE TIME MONEY WHEN SOME OF THESE ISSUES WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ON REQUIRE -- ONGOING INVESTMENT SO WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT FOCUSING ON US ON HIS AS I MENTIONED HIS. PROPOSALS RELATED FACILITIES AND THE WORK FORCE AT THIS IS THAT A GOOD TIMING TO DISCUSS THIS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE ASSEMBLY JUST CONCLUDING OUR WORK ON EARLY EDUCATION A TWO YEAR PROCESS. WITH OUR ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY EDUCATION THAT WAS SPEARHEADED BY OUR SPEAKER WHICH WE JUST AYE WRAPPED UP. AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ARE A DRAFT FORM RIGHT NOW BECOMING PUBLIC AND NUMBER WEEKS AND DOVETAIL NICELY -- WITH THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEFORE US. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS AND WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN GOING FORWARD AS WELL AS MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THIS YEAR. SO WITH THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY -- LOOK FOR IT CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MINISTRATION OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TO TO FINE TUNE -- THIS PROPOSAL AND WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN -- THE HEARING AND WILL FOCUS WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO LET'S BRING UP DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE LA -- AND THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION OKAY PLEASE BE GET BERMAN A FINANCE. YOU -- KEITH IS ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND -- TO ADDRESS FACILITIES NEEDS THAT ARE DRASTIC -- PREVENTING SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM I'M NOT OFFERING -- ALL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS THIS BUILDS UPON -- ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACTED -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- THIS PROPOSAL LAST YEAR'S IS THERE WE ARE -- ALLOWING VISIT SAVINGS ON FACILITIES PRICE TO BE USED FOR A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT WOULD HELP ADDRESS -- BUILT RAMP UP TO PROVIDE THE THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS AT THOSE -- SCHOOLS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] LA A GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR MEMBERS ARE IN THE LEAD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT WHICH WILL BE REFERENCING FOR THE FIRST THREE AGENDA ITEMS THIS MORNING. STARTING ON PAGE ONE WE OFFER SOME BACKGROUND ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANTS. AS BACKGROUND ON KINDERGARTEN AT THE STATE REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE KINDERGARTEN BUT LEAVE IT TO THE DISTRICTS TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE DAY PROGRAMS OPERATE BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS WHEREAS FULL THE PROGRAMS OPERATE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. AS YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO FIND MORE DEFINED CONCERNING FACILITY GRANTS. IS GRANTS WERE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I COVERING FACILITY COSTS AS A SEED WITH CONVERTING THOSE PART DAY PROGRAMS TO FULL DAY. FOR INSTANCE A DISTRICTS ME RUN A MORNING SESSION AND AN AFTERNOON SESSION IN ONE SHARED CLASSROOM BUT ONCE THOSE TWO PARTY PROGRAMS ARE CONVERTED TO FULL DAY EACH PROGRAM REQUIRES ITS OWN SEPARATE CLASS ROOM. THESE GRANTS WOULD HELP COVER ASSOCIATED FACILITY COST. IN THE FIRST APPLICATION AROUND WHICH CONCLUDED JANUARY THIS YEAR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY DISTRICTS SUBMITTED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PROJECTS REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION AND PROJECT FUNDS. THIS MEANS THAT. AT THE PROJECT THE PROGRAM IS NOW OVERSUBSCRIBED EXCEEDS THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION INITIALLY ALLIED. AWARDED -- A SECOND APPLICATION AROUND WILL OCCUR AND MADE TO ALLOCATE THE REMAINING FUNDING. I'M PAGE TWO WE COVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY COVERED AND SO WILL BE SKIPPING ON TO PAGE. THREE OUR THIS PAGE CONTAINS OUR ASSESSMENTS OUT WE OUTLINED THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST WE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE DIGITAL GRANTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO CHEAT THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE THREE WE ANALYZE THE INITIAL ROUND OF APPLICANTS AND FOUND THAT 76%. OF THE SEVENTY APPLICANTS ALREADY RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS. THESE ARE PROGRAMS LARGELY TO ARE LARGELY APPLYING TO REPLACE EXISTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS THAT O NOT MEET CD E. REGULATIONS THIS WAS A SECONDARY PURPOSE FOR THESE GRANTS. IF THE LEGISLATURE WORD EXPANDS THE PROGRAM AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE THINK A SIMILARLY HIGH SHARE OF THE GRANTS WOULD GO TOWARDS DISTRICTS ALREADY RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS. SECONDLY WE FOUND THAT DISTRICTS ME OPERATE PARTY PROGRAMS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BEYOND JUST FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME DISTRICTS TOLD US THAT THEIR PARENTS PREFERRED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO PART DAY PROGRAMS -- OTHER DISTRICTS INDICATED THAT THEIR TEACHERS PREFER PART DAY PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY LEAD CLASS FOR PART OF THE DAY AND THEY OFFER OTHER TEACHERS ASSISTANCE AT AND YOUR THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. GIVEN THOSE ISSUES WE THINK THAT SOME PORTION OF DISTRICTS RUNNING PARTY PROGRAMS MAY SIMPLY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THESE GRANTS. THIRD MOST DISTRICTS OPERATING A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WERE ABLE TO COVER EXIST WERE ABLE TO COVER FACILITY COSTS WITH EXISTING SOURCES OF STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE SHARE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FULL DAY PROGRAMS GREW FROM 43% A DISTRICT INTERESTED IN RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FACILITY FUNDING UNDER THE EXISTING SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM THE STATE'S BROADER LONGER STANDING PROGRAM THAT HELPS STIFF SPONGE SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR ALL GRADES. OR DISTRICTS MAY RELY ON LOCAL FINDS A DRESS SO ANY CONSTRAINTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REFRAIN FROM EXPANDING THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR AND WE DO OFFER TO TARGETED OPTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE REMAIN INTERESTED IN PROMOTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR AFTER KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE DEMANDS AFTER THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS AWARDED. IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO PROVIDE MORE FACILITY GRANTS BASED ON ANY REMAINING DEMANDS WE RECOMMEND IT. FOCUS THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ON DISTRICTS RUNNING PARTY PROGRAMS DUE TO FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. SECONDLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER CREATING AN EVEN STRONGER INCENTIVE FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS BY REDUCING THE PARTY PER STUDENT RATE UNDER LCF OVER THREE YEARS. CURRENTLY PART DAY AND FULL DAY PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED AT THE SAME PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVEL AND THIS IS DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE IN INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS. HOWEVER BEFORE LOWERING THE PART DAY RATE THAT LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER WEIGHING THE TRADE OFFS CAREFULLY SINCE SOME PARENTS DO PREFER TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN APART DAY PROGRAMS. WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM ALLEY -- WILL BE COVERING THE REMAINDER OF A HAND OUT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. I AM SO WE ARE. A PRIMARILY HERE FOR QUESTIONS BUT WE CAN THAT'S OKAY. SURE I KNOW WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK THE FIRST ONE I KNOW YOU'RE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRESENTATION WAS WAS BRIEF JUST GOT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET BUT I WONDERED IF YOU COULD. START US OFF BY RESPONDING TO WHAT OUR STAFF OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA AND WHAT LA -- TALK ABOUT AS FAR AS THE THAT THE DEMAND WHETHER OR NOT THERE TRULY IS. DEMAND FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION LAST YEAR ALONE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MORE THIS YEAR. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE LAW THE SCHOOLS AT THAT -- THAT THAT PICKED UP ON THIS LAST YEAR RT WERE AT FULL DAY IN THE USE THE MONEY FOR OTHER. OTHER WHERE THE NEEDS FACILITIES OF COURSE BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO EXPAND THE FULL DAY. SURE -- YET WHEN WE WERE DEVELOPING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SEEING THE THE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS ARE COMING IN AND FROM WHICH SCHOOLS THEY'RE COMING IN FROM -- WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE -- LOOKING AT THAT INFORMATION AS WE DEVELOP THE MAY REVISION -- AND TRYING TO A LINE -- THE PROGRAM WITH THE BROADER INTENT OF YOU KNOW. REDUCING BARRIERS FOR FOR CONVERSION FROM PART DATA FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS -- IN TERMS OF DEMAND -- WE LOOKED AT RESEARCH FROM THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION THAT AND INDICATED THAT THERE'S SIXTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOL SITES THAT AREN'T OFFERING HER ONLY OFFERING PART DAY -- PROGRAMS AND BASED ON THAT -- NUMBER -- WE DEVELOPED IN AN ESTIMATE AN ASSUMPTION THAT THERE THERE WOULD BE SOME DEMAND FROM THOSE DISTRICTS AFTER A PROPER INCENTIVES WERE THERE TO REDUCE THE MAIN BARRIER WHICH FROM THE RESEARCH WE LOOKED AT IS. FACILITIES CONSTRAINTS. SO DOES THAT MEAN I'LL BE A REVISED PROPOSAL. IN MAY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT HELPED SHAPE WITH THAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. I'M UNABLE TO SAY WE KNOW WHAT WILL BE IN A MARRIAGE THAT IS MY BEST EVELYN WE'RE TAKING IN THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM YOU KNOW LET THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WELL AS FEEDBACK FROM THE FIELD AND WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT AS AS WE DEVELOP. THE CHAIR. AND THESE ARE ONE TIME MONIES OUTSIDE OF NINETY EIGHT SO CERTAINLY OTHER. AT INTEREST IN THE STATE COULD COULD YOU KNOW VIE FOR THIS BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE OTHER INTERESTS IN EDUCATION EARLY AT FOR ONE TIME. SUCH AS T. K. FACILITIES OR STATE PRESCHOOL THE SO SO FAR SO THE AN INTEREST IN THE OPEN TO LOOK AT THOSE OTHER NEEDS WITH THIS ONE TIME PART OF MONEY. CERTAINLY -- THE YEAH THAT TKA CLASSROOMS ARE AND IN OUR VIEW IS THE SAME AS THE THE KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM SO ON THEY WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING -- AND YET THAT IS A GOAL OF THIS FUNDING IS TO CAN YOU KNOW PROVIDE FULL DAY. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AS WELL OKAY YET WE'RE TAKING ALL THE FEEDBACK INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU I WANTED TO ALSO WELCOME OUR BUDGET CHAIR THING FOR JOINING US TODAY POTS AND HEARING THERE ESPECIALLY. AREAS THAT HAVE A STRONG INTEREST TO HIM IN THIS ONE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOK AT LAST COUPLE YEARS. LARGE PART BECAUSE OF YEAR RAISING THIS ISSUE SO I KNOW YOU WANTED TO JUMP IN HERE MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER JUST -- TO L. L. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOKED AT I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT PERHAPS SOME PARENTS SOME DISTRICTS MAY NOT WANT TO MOVE TO A FULL DAY -- WAS OR ANY LOOK AT WHAT THE BENEFITS OF FULL DAY PURSES PART DAY. WERE FROM A PEDAGOGICAL POINT OF VIEW ARE ARE ARE THEIR BENEFITS OR IS IT YOU KNOW A FULL DAY OF VERSES PARTY THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. SURE SO WE DID EXPLICITLY INCLUDE A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS BUT WE DID TAKE A BRIEF LOOK AT IT. THROUGH THE MAIN PROPONENT OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS THAT THE PROPONENT SHARES A IS THAT HAVING MORE INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS BENEFITS CHILDREN ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME CHILDREN -- AND THIS IS MORE LIKELY TO PRAYER THEM BETTER FOR FIRST GRADE AND THIS ALSO HELPS PARENTS WITH CHILD CARE NEEDS. WHEN WE DID A TIME LIMITED REVIEW OF THE LITTLE RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT SOME RESEARCH DID SUPPORT ACADEMIC BENEFITS BUT OFTEN TIMES THERE WAS A FEET OUT A FACT SO YOU COULD SEE IMPROVEMENTS AND EITHER READING OR MATH BUT THEY WOULD? DISAPPEAR BY FIRST OR THIRD GRADER SOMEONE -- AND SO IN OUR UNDERSTANDING THE RESEARCH ISN'T ENTIRELY. CONCLUSIVE BUT UP THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUPPORT OF EVIDENCE OUT THERE. GREAT IN IN TERMS IN JUST IN TERMS OF THE REGION -- IT IS IT IS A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED WHO DOES FULL DAY VERSUS -- PARTY OR IS IT IS OUR CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TREND IS MORE BY INCOME LEVEL -- PER DAY SEEMS TO BE MORE PREVALENT. AMONG HIGHER INCOME GEHRY AS WHEREAS FULL DAY SEEMS TO BE MORE PROBABLY IN LOWER INCOME AREAS -- WE BELIEVE PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE IN HIGHER INCOME AREAS PARENTS DO HAVE OTHER CHILD CARE OPTIONS AND SO IT MIGHT BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEIR SCHEDULE OR THEY'RE DOING THEIR NEEDS TO ACTUALLY. DO PART DAY. THANK YOU AND THEN WITH WITH THE CURRENT -- GRANT PROCESS -- YOU HAD MENTIONED LOOKS LIKE. I BELIEVE -- NINE NINE DISTRICTS THAT ARE FULL AND PART DAY APPLIED AND THEN. EIGHT DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART DAY ONLY THEN THEN BASED ON THAT GO HOW WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE PERCENTAGE WOULD JUMP FROM BECAUSE YOU HAD 70% FULL DAY. TWO WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IT'LL MOVE TO BASED ON THAT -- THAT PARTICIPATION. AND THEN THE AND THE SUPER TENNIS OPTICALLY AFTER TWO OR OUR ACCOUNT MINOR AT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION I AM IN THIS ROUND WE DID SEE THE MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS THAT APPLIED WERE ALREADY OFFERING FULL THEY CAN -- BUT ON THE APPLICATION FORMS THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY'RE OFFERING IN CLASSROOMS THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED OR MAYBE ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR KINDERGARTEN PURPOSES. WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT TEACHER WORK ROOMS OR SCIENCE LABS ARE JUST ROOMS THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR KINDERGARTEN. YEAH BUT IT WAS SIXTEEN DISTRICTS OUT OF A SEVENTY TWO THAT DID NOT OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO WE WOULD -- IF THERE WERE NO PROGRAM CHANGES WE WOULD EXPECT ALL OF THESE DISTRICTS TO APPLY AGAIN IN THE SECOND ROUND BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT. ALL OF THEM OVERSEE FUNDING THIS ROUND SO THAT PERCENTAGE CAM COULD BE THE SAME BUT WE ALSO ARE GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT DID NOT APPLY IN THE FIRST ROUND SO WE ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS COMING IN FOR OUR SECOND ROUND THAT OPENS UP IN MAY AS WELL WE DON'T KNOW THE BREAKDOWN YET OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING. FOR DO YOU DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE PERCENTAGE MIGHT JUMP TO THEN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE AT 70% FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WE IT'S KINDA HARD TO TELL AT THIS POINT WE WOULD MAYBE KNOW A LITTLE MORE AFTER THE SECOND ROUND BUT WE ARE GETTING CALLS FROM THOSE THAT DON'T CURRENTLY OFFER IT IT'S JUST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE GONNA MATERIALIZE YET GOT IT. THE BILL JUST COME BACK TO THE LA IS POINT SO SO YOU'RE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT -- THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS LESS PARTICIPATION OR OR THEY'VE MOVING IN TO A PART THAT SCRIPT PART TIME IS RIGHT PRIMARILY THE THE HIGHER INCOME ERROR IS THAT IS THAT [inaudible] CORRECT. I'M SORRY WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THAT YEAH SEE SO YOU HAD SAID EARLIER THAT. THE DISTRICTS THAT HAD PARTAKE IN THE GARDEN A LOT OF THEM WERE DOING IT MORE OUT OF CONVENIENCE AND THEIR PARENTAL INTEREST WHICH IS. A BIT SO THEY ARE HIRING CAMARO SOURCES LOWER INCOME AREAS. YES BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME LOWER INCOME AREAS THAT ARE RUNNING PER DAY PROGRAMS. AND WHO DID. DID THEY SHOW INTEREST IN APPLYING OR WERE THEY ALSO RESIST NOT RESISTANT BUT NOT INTERESTED APPLY. WE DIDN'T REACH OUT TO YOU DISTRICTS TO THOSE DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY -- OUR ANALYSIS WE REACHED OUT TO A HANDFUL OF DISTRICTS ARE RUNNING PER DAY PROGRAM -- BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT YEAH IF YOU COULD THOUGH I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE AT THE BECAUSE I THINK WE DO WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT -- THE MONEY'S REALLY HAVE IN THE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE PROPER BENEFIT IMPROPERLY BENEFITING THE COMMUNITIES THAT. REALLY NEED THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND NO THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN IN IN SERVING WANTS AND NEEDS. AND I THINK IN THIS ARENA TITLE ONE SCHOOLS ARE REALLY THE NEED. AND THEN THEY NEED NOW -- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PRIORITIZE -- THIS EFFORT THE FACILITY EFFORT THE FULL THEY CAN -- EFFORT ON ON THE TITLE ONE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE NEED IT I UNDERSTAND THAT AS A PARENT I WOULD LIKE FULL THEY CAN -- IN MY KIDS DID NOT HAVE FULL DAY BUT I MAYBE FOR A MORNING CARD FOR CHILD CARE PURPOSES BUT REALLY WE'RE FOCUSING ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THOSE TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. WHAT ARE WE DOING OF TO FOCUS THIS MONEY ON TITLE ONE SCHOOLS? SO THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PREFERENCE IN FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS TO QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS AND ALSO FOR DISTRICTS THAT. QUALIFY FOR WHAT'S THAT CALLED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP UNDER THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAMS OF THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE LOCAL RESOURCES -- TO MAKE THEIR MATCHING SHARE FOR FACILITIES. AND SO WE DID SEE A MIX IT'S A SLIDING SCALE ON THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS SO THE THE THE MORE STUDENTS YOU HAVE THAT QUALIFY FOR THAT PROGRAM THE MORE PREFERENCE YOUR APPLICATION WILL RECEIVE. AND WITH THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP IT'S IT'S AN ALL OR NOTHING SYSTEM SO IF YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR MATCH YOU GET FORTY POINTS IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MATCH YOU DON'T GET THOSE POINTS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS. IS THAT IF YOU DID NOT QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP -- THEN YOU'RE NOT IN THE MIX FOR FUNDING SO ALL OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF THIS FIRST AB BATCH OF THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE FIRST ROUND. QUALIFIED FOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP SO THEY NEED ASSISTANCE FOR THAT PROGRAM. AND THEN THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS OF THE SLIDING SCALE AND THE PERCENTAGES ARE PRETTY HIGH. THE POINTS CUT OFF AT ABOUT 60% SO YOU DON'T GET ANY PREFERENCE UNLESS YOU'VE HAD AT LEAST 60% FOR INTRODUCED PRICE MEALS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT TELLS US HOW MANY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS ARE NOW. PROVIDING FULL THEY CAN -- DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW THAT. IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE DO DO WE KNOW HOW MANY TITLE. ONE OKAY BELIEVE IT AT THAT BUT I JUST I JUST WANT TO BACK UP TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT A SCHOOL SITE TO WHEN THERE IS. PART A KENDER. AND I THINK AGAIN I'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS A COUPLE YEARS I KNOW MR TINGS A BIG PROPONENTOF THIS CONCEPT. WITH THAT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS NEED TO BE FIRST. THAT THAT THAT'S MY BIG PRIORITY AND THEIR IMMEDIATE -- BECAUSE THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE CONNECTION. BETWEEN PEOPLE THEY CAN -- IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; QUALITATIVE BE A&lt;/c&gt; QUANTITATIVE -- ALSO ON A SCHOOL SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOL DAY I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK BY THE TEACHER THAT THE KIND OF OUR TEACHER ONLY WORKS HALF AND THEN THE THE REST THEY MAY THEY GO HOME EARLY THAT THAT'S NOT ALL THE CASE -- IF IT'S DONE RIGHT AND TYPICALLY IT IS DONE RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT -- PART DAY CANDOR TEACHER IS NOT WITH THEIR HEART A CLASS BECAUSE THE DAY HAS ENDED THEY WILL GO INTO ANOTHER CLASSROOM IT TYPICALLY WOULD BE A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM. SO TEACHERS WOULD DOUBLE UP. BASICALLY GIVE STUDENTS FOCUS OR THEY MIGHT BE IN A GREAT ONE TWO THREE DOING A READING RECOVERY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I JUST YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S IMPACTS TO OF OF OF CREATING FOR THEY CAN -- BECAUSE YOU GONNA TAKE SOME TEACHERS OUT OF CLASSROOM SO THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE IN. CLOSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS I JUST WANT THAT DYNAMIC TO BE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED HERE TO WITH THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY I FOR THE QUESTIONS. ALL US ONE MON MORE AS WELL BUT ALSO I THINK IT HAS A GOOD QUESTION MISTER O'DONNELL ABOUT. TITLE ONE SCHOOLS AND WHERE THE BIGGEST THE IT IS SO I KNOW WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SOMEWHERE OUT THERE SO IF SOMEONE'S HERO. WHAT'S TO COME UP AND HAS THE ANSWER -- YOU'RE WELCOME BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER YOU CAN JUST THINK THEY ATTACK WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW. I ALSO WANTED TO ABOUT EVEN IF IT IS -- THE FACILITIES IN CLASSROOMS THE ISSUE IS IS IS THE RATED SO. HAVING YOU KNOW DOUBLE DOUBLE DARE ONCE A DAY -- DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO TO ALTER. THE AMOUNT THAT WE THAT WE PAY FOR THE STATE FOR FULL DAY VERSES PARK DAY TO INCENTIVIZE. DISTRICTS TO GO [inaudible] FULL DAY. WE THINK THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WE UNDERSTAND IT IS QUITE A SHIFT FROM. WE GET THAT BUT YES IS IT A GOOD IDEA. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MERITS TO THAT IDEA WHICH IS WHY WE BROUGHT IT UP AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I'M CURRENTLY PER DAY AND FULL THEY ARE FIND IT AT THE SAME RATE DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE IN INSTRUCTIONAL OUR IN SO IT MAY BE A SIMPLE INCENTIVE THAT WOULDN'T. REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO PICK UP FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN YEAH WILL BE THE DOWNSIDE OF COURSE THAT THEIR SON THEY'RE DOING FULL DAY AND SO THE SOMEONE OF A WINDFALL FOR THEM. BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE DOWNSIDE IF IF THERE DISTRICTS THAT. FOR VARIOUS REASONS PARENT DEMAND. JUST SPACE LIMITATIONS. WHERE WE REDUCE THE RATE? FOR YES FOR CLASSROOMS AGO PARK DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WHAT POTENTIALLY WOULD BE THAT THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT. I'M STILL AT JUST TO CLARIFY. DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THEY WOULDN'T SEE A CHANGE AND THEY'RE FINDING UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. IT WOULD JUST BE DISTRICTS RUNNING PART DAY PROGRAMS -- I THINK THEIR CONSIDERATIONS WOULD REALLY BE SOME PARENTS PREFER NOT TO RUN OR NOT. TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO FULL THEY PROGRAMS AND SO SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS MAYBE INTENTIONALLY CHOOSING TO RUN PART DAY PROGRAMS IN REFLECTION OF THE PROVINCES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS READ ON IF I MAY. I I THINK THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IF YOU'RE PAYING IF YOU'RE GOING. TO BUY FOR GATE DID THAT BUT I'VE YOU'RE GONNA SPLIT UP HOW YOU PAY -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR IF YOU PAY THEM FOR PART DAY AND PAY THE PAY THEM SO MUCH FOR PART IN AND MAYBE MORE FOR FULL THEY REMEMBER. YOUR TYPICALLY GOING TO HAVE A FULL TIME TEACHER THERE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT FULL TIME TEACHER HAS DUTIES OTHER THAN. IS THAT THAT THAT. THREE HOURS THREE HOURS THEY MIGHT SPEND WITH STUDENTS SO THAT I THINK THERE'D. BE A SIGNIFICANT. FINANCIAL IMPACT AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A GREATER STAKE YES HI ACID WITHIN ABOUT DOWNSIDES WERE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT THE MEDICAL INSURANCE. OKAY WELL FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. LET'S PROCEED NOW NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS SCENE WILL PROCEED NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO PRESCHOOL EXPANSION. TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE. HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN. ONGOING NONPROFIT NINETY EIGHT FOR TEN THOUSAND THIS IN A FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. FOR NON ELLIE A PROVIDERS. AND WITH THIS WE ARE GOING -- TO DO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY TODAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO PANELS ONE OF COURSE IS THE TYPICAL. BERMAN A FINANCE LA -- AND DEPARTMENT OF BAD IN OUR SECOND PANEL WILL HEAR FROM. ELLIE A AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY BASED. PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA SO FIRST WE'LL START WITH PANEL. ONE FROM THE FINANCE LA OF DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING SIR BURDEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE INCLUDES MULTIPLE AUGMENTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN PROGRAMS FOR ZERO TO FIVE YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE. THE EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS JUST ONE PART OF IT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DON PROPOSITION -- NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS TO NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TEN THOUSAND SUBSEQUENT SLOTS FOR THE NEXT TWO BUDGET YEARS TWO AT A TOTAL OF THIRTY THOUSAND SLOTS TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD. IN THE STATE FOR A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS BY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNIVERSAL PRE K. THANK YOU [inaudible] ELIA -- GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT MY COLLIE PROVIDED -- DURING THE LAST ISSUE UNTITLED EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET PROPOSALS AND WILL BE STARTING -- ON PAGE FIVE OF THIS HAND OUT -- OFFERS PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THIS ISSUE SO THE STATE SERVICE THE STATE SERVES A PRESCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES -- THIS THIS PROGRAM HAS TO KEY OBJECTIVES ONE IS TO PROVIDE KINDERGARTEN READING THIS AND THEN FOR THE FULL DAY COMPONENT OF TO HELP LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES I MEET THEIR CHILD CARE NEEDS WHEN THEY'RE WORKING OR GOING TO SCHOOL OR HAVE OTHER NEEDS. YES TO MAKE THE PROGRAM SERVES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND STATE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN THE BULK OF THAT -- IN HIS FOUR YEAR OLDS. ON PAGE FIVE THIS FIGURE SHOWS -- THAT'S A PRE SCHOOLS OFFERED BY SEVERAL TYPES OF PROVIDERS AND THIS IS SPLIT BETWEEN ELEAZAR AND NON ELLIE PROVIDERS ELOISE WOULD BE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. NON LEDS WOULD BE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CITY GOVERNMENTS. ELLIE IS PROVIDE TWO THIRDS OF THE SLOTS NON ELLIE'S PROVIDE A THIRD OF THE SLOTS FOR ELLIE ETS -- THE BULK OF THE SLOTS THAT THEY SERVE OUR PART DAY SLOTS WERE FOR NON LEDS AT THIS LITTLE BIT US MORE SPLIT HOW HALF AND HALF. TO A GREATER SHARE OF NON ELEAZAR OF SLAUGHTER FULL DAY RELATIVE TO ELEAZAR. I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE SIX THIS DISPLAYS THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL THE FULL THEY STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- THIS PIECE A PRESCHOOL THE FULL THEY SAY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM HAS EXPANDED BY 70% AND I WOULD JUST KNOW THIS IS JUST FULL DAY PRESCHOOL. I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE SEVEN ON THE PERMANENT FINANCE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S UP PROPOSAL I'LL JUST NOTE TO MORE THINGS ON THE SECOND AND THIRD. OF BOLD OF THIS PAGE THIS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO EXT. ALSO EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO CAN TAKE UP A FULL THEY SLIDE IT'S REMOVING -- THE WORK RECALL OF ITS REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THAT FAMILIES HAVE TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL TO FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FULL DAY PROGRAM. THE OTHER THING IT DOES IS IT SHIFTING ON SOME OF THE STATE PRIEST THE SOME OF THE PRESS A STATE PRESCHOOL FUNDS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH PROP NINETY EIGHT OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY SO. UP AND NON ELLIE IS WOULD BE FUNDED COMPLETELY WITH NINE NINETY EIGHT MONEY. I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE EIGHT IS OUR ASSESSMENT. A WE WE THINK THAT EXPANDING STATE PRESCHOOL FOR NON ELEAZAR IS MORE LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES AND THIS IS BECAUSE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH -- NON ELEAZAR TENDED TO OPERATE LONGER PROGRAMS -- TYPICALLY A TEN HOURS A PROGRAMS OR MORE -- SO WE THINK THIS WOULD ADDRESS FAMILIES AT WORK LONGER HOURS. WE DO KNOW THAT THE STATE AND PROVIDERS AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND AS QUICKLY AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. AND THIS IS RECOGNIZING SOME ADMINISTRATIVE AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE ON THIS WOULD BE A HEAVY LIFT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION -- THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE. TO THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REVIEW APPLICATIONS FROM HUNDREDS ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS WHICH WOULD OKAY A MUCH LARGER WORKLOAD COMPARED TO THE OF THE PRIOR MORE MODERATE EXPANSION -- AND WE DO WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE LAST TIME NINE LA PROVIDERS WERE YOUR MARKS LOTS IT WAS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PLUS WHICH IS QUITE. WHICH IS A MUCH LOWER AMOUNT OF SLOTS COMPARED -- TO THAT WHAT IS PROPOSED. AND WE'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING SOME LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES ON FACILITIES ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE OF THIS EXPANSION AND THIS A MAGNITUDE OF EXPANSION FOR REQUIRE PROVIDERS. TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES -- WHICH COULD WHICH COULD BE A BARRIER FOR SOME PROVIDERS. MOVING ON TO PAGE -- NINE WE CONTINUE OUR ASSESSMENT ON THIS PAGE WE DISCUSSED THE WORK REQUIREMENT WE THINK THE WORK REQUIREMENT IS REASONABLE TO PRIORITIZE FULL DAY CARE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THAT HAVE THE WORKING OR SCHOOL REQUIREMENT MEANS. AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT ALL LOW INCOME ELIGIBLE CHILDREN HOW ARE. ALTHOUGH INCOME CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PART A PART OF THIS PROGRAM -- AND THEN WE ALSO NOTE THAT REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT COULD INCREASE COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF THE PROGRAM SO THE FULL DAY SLOT IS DOUBLE THE COST OF A PARTY SLOT SO THIS COULD CREATE SOME COST PRESSURE ON THE PROGRAM WHERE SOME SLOTS TO CONVERT. SOME PARTY THOUGHTS WERE COULD TO CONVERT TO FILL THE SLOTS -- AN ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THIS COULD RESULT IN SERVING FEWER CHILDREN. WE HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGE -- TEN AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S LONG TERM PLAN OF SERVING ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WE JUST HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS. AND THE FIRST IS TO START UP TO FUNDS FEWER SLOTS IN THE FIRST YEARI'M STE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN. AND STARTING SLOTS OF IN STARTING THE SLOTS MEDIA YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT THEN PAGE TEN ONLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PAGE. TEN SUMMARY -- I AM SO SORRY GIVE US THAT SNAPSHOT YEAH SO FIRST THING IS WE'RE SAYING FUNDS FEWER SLOTS -- AND AND THAT'S IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE THE THE THE PLAN OF SERVING ALL LOW INCOME FOR YOUR OWN THAT THREE STATE WE SHOULD FUND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NOT YEAH WE'RE JUST THEN WE SHOULD ACTUALLY -- TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AS A STARTING POINT -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD FIND MORE OR LESS BUT TAKING THIS FIRST YEAR IN LOOKING AT AND LETTING IT BE A BENCHMARK FOR WHAT THEY COULD CONSIDER TO FIND IN FUTURE YEARS TO MEET THE GOAL OF SERVING ALL INCOME FOR OLD. ROSS IS SUGGESTING START A FUNDING SLOTS MID YEAR JUST TO GIVE TIME FOR STEVIE E. TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR PROVIDERS TO SECURE FACILITIES HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND ROLL CHILDREN. WE ALSO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE -- ONGOING FUNDING TO ASSIST WITH THE FACILITY ISSUES SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING FUNDING TO LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS -- WITH THIS FUNDS A LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS WOULD HIRE FACILITY SPECIALIST BASILEUS SPECIALISTS WOULD HELP PROVIDERS ME SOME OF THE LOCAL BARRIERS. WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING FUNDING THE WORK REQUIREMENT FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS AND GIVES AND GIVES LOTS TO PROVIDERS -- OPERATING AT LEAST TEN HOURS A DAY AND THESE TWO RULES WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES. WE ALSO SUPPORT ANON ELLIE A SLOTS FROM ONE FUND SOURCE IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD GO FURTHER -- INFANCY PRESCHOOL FOR ALL PROVIDERS FROM ONE FUND SOURCE. ON THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN -- STAFF AND MEMBERS NAMES KIND JACKSON ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT. STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND BEFORE YOU BEGIN THIS ITEM I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THANK YOU AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD WORKING GAUGING AND ELEVATING EARLY LEARNING AND CARE ISSUES OVER THE YEARS. AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP EXPANDING ACCESS TO QUALITY PROGRAMS. THE SUPERINTENDENT IS SO EXCITED TO SEE THE EGG KNOWLEDGE MINT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY LEARNING AND CARE AND THE FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE WHOLE CHILD. AND FAMILY MORE BROADLY WHILE THE FOCUS ON THIS ITEM IS PRIMARILY ON PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION WE WANTED TO QUICKLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOVERNOR'S. CONCENTRATED FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD WITH AN ENTIRE CHAPTER THE FIRST CHAPTER ONE IS BUDGET SUMMARY DEVOTED TO EARLY CHILDHOOD ISSUES. IN THIS CHAPTER THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT THREE ESSENTIAL PILLAR TO SUPPORTING THE WHOLE CHILD AND FAMILY IS BUDGET. AS A MEANS TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND REDUCE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES WHICH ARE EARLY ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH OPPORTUNITIES. TO EXPANDING EARLY LEARNING AND CARE OPPORTUNITIES TO ALLOW LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS PAID PATERNAL LEAVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS. TO HELP CATCH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EARLIER. TWO GENERATIONS STRATEGIES SUCH AS HOME VISITING AND CAL CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARDS FOR STUDENT PROGRAMS. AND ECONOMIC SECURITY SUCH AS INCREASING CAL WORKS GRANTS. SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN STRONGLY BELIEVES THIS FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD IS ESSENTIAL TO MOVING THE NEEDLE ON IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. OF ALL AGES. BY FOCUSING ON THE WHOLE CHILD IN INVESTING IN QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS. WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE PROGRESS AND BAY BREAKING THE CYCLE OF POVERTY CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP IN STOPPING. THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WE ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR CALIFORNIA HAS COME IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN YOURSELVES FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS. AND TO THE QUALITY OF EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THANKS TO YOUR INVESTMENTS AND EFFORTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN INVESTMENTS IN EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEMS. ARE NO LONGER BELOW PRE RECESSION LEVELS THIS IS DUE IN LARGE PART TO RATE INCREASES ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THE EXPANSION OF STATE PRESCHOOL. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AS ADDED FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND NEW FULL DAY FULL YEAR SLOTS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE SUPERINTENDENT IS EXCITED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FURTHER EXPAND STATE PRESCHOOL SO THAT ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WILL BE SERVED BY SUBSIDIZED PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. STARTING WITH AN INCREASE OF TEN THOUSAND NEW FULL DAY. FOUR YEAR STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS FOR NON ELEAZAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THE PROVIDERS IN THE FIELD THAT ARE BEST POSITIONED TO FURTHER EXPAND ON FULL DAY FOR YOUR SERVICES. AND THAT THE PROPOSAL COMES PAIRED WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS CAPACITY INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT EARLY LEARNING. IN CARE WORK FORCE AND FACILITIES. WE KNOW THAT FURTHER EXPANDING STATE PRESCHOOL IS VERY IS A VERY STRONG FIRST STEP. TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY RESEARCH SHOWS US CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND DISRUPT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AS WE THINK AS A STATE ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND EARLY. EXPAND EARLY ACCESS TO EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL GREAT NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE IN MANY COUNTIES STATEWIDE. OVERALL THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS HAS DECLINED BY ABOUT TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SLOTS. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL RATE INCREASE IN THE RATES FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED LAST YEAR WHICH MAKE IT EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO OFFER SUBSIDIZED INFANT. AND TODDLER SPACES. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING FOR SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING AND CARE ONLY SUPPORTS ABOUT 16% OF THE INFANTS AND TODDLERS FROM ELIGIBLE FAMILIES? WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING APPLICATIONS FARGE. FOR OUR GENERAL FUND CHILDCARE TITLE FIVE INFANT AND TODDLER PROGRAMS AND WHILE WE ONLY HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THE APPLICATIONS AMOUNTED TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN DRESSING THIS ISSUE WE'D BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY TO INVEST IN THIS MUCH NEEDED AREA. I WILL NOW TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SEPT SERRA NEVER MORGAN WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF OUR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE DIVISION AND SHE WILL PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED UPDATE ON THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION. AND OUR THOUGHTS ON IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNORS EXPANSION PROPOSAL. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THEIR NOVEL MORGAN WITH THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE ARE EXTREMELY EXCITED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. SO THAT ALL FOR LOW INCOME FOR GIRLS WILL BE SERVED BY SUBSIDIZED PEACE BOAT PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THIS SUPPORTS THE SUPERINTENDENT'S GOALS AND AS PART OF ITS PLAN TO ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THE SLOTS ARE FULL DAY FULL YEAR. THIS CHANGE ALIGNS WITH THE FEDERAL HEAD START PROGRAM AND WILL BEST PROMOTE CHILD DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES NEEDS WHO TRULY NEED AN EXPANDED OUR FOR CARE. FINALLY WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FINE CHEF TO FIND ALL OF FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL AND NON ELEAZAR WITH NON PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. CURRENTLY ARE NON ALLEY ACE TO HAVE TO JUGGLE A MIXED PROP NINETY EIGHT AND NINE NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND WHICH CAN BE CHALLENGING. SHIFTING THOSE FINES FOR NOT ONLY A C. S. B. P. PROGRAMS MEANS THEY'LL HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY. SO DIVING DEEPER INTO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL WE KNOW THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS MUCH NEEDED TO AS MANY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD. FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES STILL LACKS ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND CARE TO GIVE YOU A QUICK BREAK DOWN. BASED ON CENSUS DATA WE KNOW THERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND ARE FOR FAMILIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR OF THOSE LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND ARE FROM LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. HOWEVER OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ONLY SERVICE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES CURRENTLY. IN ADDITION TO SEE SB P. WHERE WE KNOW THE QUALITY IS HIGH AND THE STANDARDS ARE INTENTIONALLY ALIGNED TO WHAT BASS PERMITS CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO SERVE ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLD IN OTHER C. D. E. PROGRAMS AND ANOTHER A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE IN T. K. OR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT THAT LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WE'VE EXPANDED STATE PRESCHOOL -- THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND NEW FULL DAY FULL YEAR STATE PRESCHOOL SPOTS BETWEEN FOR TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO WE ARE. VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT BUT ALSO THANKFUL FOR AN ADDITIONAL PIECE. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THE RECENT AUGMENTATIONS AROUND CHALLENGES THAN BARRIERS TO EXPANDING THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. ANY EACH YEAR OF EXPANSION INTEREST AMONG NON ELLIE ACE FOR STOCKS OUTPACED AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR THOSE THOUGHTS. OVERALL IN YEARS WERE EXPANSION FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE TO BOTH ELEAZAR AND NON ELLIE ACE. NON ELEAZAR PRIDE FOR MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FULL DAY FULL YEARS. I AM THOUGHTS THAT ELEAZAR APPLIED. FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE MADE ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED FULL DAY FULL YEAR SLOTS AVAILABLE TO ELEAZAR. AND ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED FULL DAY FULL YEAR SLOTS AVAILABLE TO NON ELLIE ACE. OTHER THOUGHTS FOR ELEAZAR WE ONLY RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED FULL DAY FOR YOUR SOCKS. HOWEVER OF THE SLOTS FOR NON ELEAZAR RE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN SOCS. AS A REMINDER WE ONLY HAD AVAILABLE. ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SO FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDS THAT WERE THERE. YOU CAN ALSO SEE IN YOUR AGENDA THE ASKING AWARD AMOUNT FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FISCAL YEAR. WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF AWARDING THE SLOTS AVAILABLE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER REQUEST ON FULL DAY SLOTS AT THE NON ELEAZAR THEN WE CAN FIND. TO ILLUSTRATE THE CUTENESS OF THIS GAP. THE NON ELEAZAR REQUESTED JUST OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED FULL DAY FULL YEAR SLIGHTLY -- THOUGHTS WHICH WE WOULD NEED ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION AND NON PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT HOWEVER WE ONLY HAVE ONE POINT TWO MILLION AVAILABLE. QUITE A GAP IN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. SO WHY AM HAVE THE ELLIE AIDS NOT APPLIED FOR THESE FUNDS. AS WE'VE GONE THREAT WE FEEL IT'S DIFFICULT FOR AT LEAST OFFER THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR PROGRAMS FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE. WE KNOW THAT THAT LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE WITH A REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS HIGHER THAN OUR STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE ACROSS MOST OF THE STATE. PROVIDES CHALLENGE US THERE ALSO IS AN INCENTIVE AS YOU LOOK AT PUTTING TOGETHER TO PART DAY pPROGRAMS FIRST IS OFFERING A FULL DAY PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY ALLEY IS CAN EARN MORE FROM SERVINGFOUR YEAR OLDS AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THEN THEY CAN IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE LACK OF FACILITIES COMES UP AS THE BARRIER ALL THE TIME AND SO ADDRESSING NOT IN THE BUDGET MOVING FORWARD IS KEY AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO SEE THAT AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S CORE. INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE WE ALSO HEAR FROM ELEAZAR THAT THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR OPERATIONS ARE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF THEIR SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE CLOSE DURING THE SUMMER. SO LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE WE ARE REALLY GREAT FAULT THAT THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON EXPANDING THE NON ALLEY A COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVER THE YEARS THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND SERVICES pTHOSE SERVICE SAYS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT NOT ONLY A PROVIDERS OFTEN CAN OFFER THE FULL DAY AT TEN HOURS OR MORE OF CARE WHICH REALLY ALIGNS WITH WHAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED. M. ONE IMPORTANT PART OF ANY EXPANSION ESPECIALLY THIS ONE IS LOOKING AT WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE FANS AND PROVIDING ENOUGH RESOURCES TO CD E. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TICKET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS AS THEY APPLY FOR FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT EXPANSION. ONE THING TO REALLY CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH AN EXTENSIVE EXPANSION AS HOW WE MOVE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHAT DO WE DO WITH ELECTRONIC MONITORING ELECTRONIC OR A PHASE. COULD BE EASIER ON OUR CONTRACTORS AND HELP THEM LEFT UP AND APPLY FOR THE DOLLARS MORE IN A MORE STREAMLINED MANNER. WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT FOR EXISTING CONTRACTORS EXPANDING IT PROBABLY TAKES THEM SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION AFTER THEY'VE BEEN AWARDED FUNDS THERE'S A LOT AROUND HIRING STAFF GETTING PROGRAM. I'VE BEEN GOING FOR BRAND NEW CONTRACTORS WHO HAVE NEVER WORKED WITH THE STATE IT TAKES LONGER -- PROBABLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH GETTING THE FACILITY UP AND GOING. UNDERGOING LICENSING AND OTHER CORE COMPONENTS. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY NEW CONTRACTING AGENCIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE FOCUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT ON HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A STATE CONTRACT. BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR PUBLIC FUNDS AND BEST SUPPORT THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THIS PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THAT LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO AND CONSIDER ACCOMPANYING THE SLIDING CLEATS BUT AN EXAMINATION OF OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR STATE PRESCHOOL. THIS COULD BE EXPLORED MORE DEEPLY AND THE STUDIES COMMISSIONED AS PART OF THE TEN MILLION STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WILL COME UP LATER IN THE AGENDA. CELL I LOOK FOR IT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE COMING MONTHS AS YOU ANALYZE THESE PROPOSALS. THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY. SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP THAT EAT YOU UP HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT FOR QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU BRING THE NEXT PANEL. QUESTIONS FOR THIS [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMóN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND SPECIFICALLY -- I I HEARD FROM -- THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO CATCH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EARLY AND SO IN LIGHT OF THAT ARE THERE ANY. THOUGHTS OR IDEAS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THE WORK FORCE. IS ALSO -- IT TRAINED AND EIGHT YOU KNOW STATE WIDE. IS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CATCH THOSE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH INTEREST ON THE NUMBER OF SPOTS AND CLEARLY THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- OUR EVIDENCE TO WHY THE NUMBER OF SPOTS ARE IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T LOSE THE FACT THAT. THE ISSUE OF QUALITY A CHILD CARE GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE NUMBER OF SPOTS AND WE CAN'T JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SPOTS WITHOUT ALSO TARGETING SOME OF OUR ADDITIONAL VERY IMPORTANT GOALS WHICH IS. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HEALTH YOUR KIDS THAT WERE CATCHING DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT. STILL YES DEFINITELY AND I THINK WE'LL GET TO THAT A LITTLE BIT IN THE WORK FORCE ITEM A LITTLE BIT LATER ON BECAUSE THE WORK FORCE IS KEY. WE ALL KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT THOSE ADULTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE CHILDREN IN THOSE ADULT CHILD INTERACTIONS. WE APPRECIATE YOU. MENTIONING NOT AND THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM IS ALSO REALLY COR SUPER THAT CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THEY FOLLOW THE TITLE FIVE STANDARDS WERE TO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. THEY DO NOT REQUIRED DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OUR HEAD START COUNTERPARTS DO REQUIRE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AS PART OF THEIR PROGRAM STANDARDS. SAID THAT SOMETHING AS WE CONTINUE TO TRAIN A LYING AT A STATE LEVEL BETWEEN US -- HEAD START AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE STATE PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS CONSIDER AS A PIECE OF THAT WE DO HAVE IT IN THE QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM. SAID DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AS SOMETHING THAT THE EARLY EDUCATORS AND FAMILY CHAPTER PROVIDERS ARE TRAINED JOHN AS PART OF THEIR QUEUE CC. PARTICIPATION AND THEN -- THEY GET POINTS AWARDED ON SORT OF HOW OFTEN AND HOW THEY'RE DOING OF DEVELOPMENTAL SCREEN AND HOW THEY'RE TAKING THAT INFORMATION BACK INTO THE PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT THE BEST SUPPORTING CHILDREN. SO THEN I MINUTES SAVE SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AND FOR THE WORK FORCE PART OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE KINDS. OKAY I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE OVERALL ISSUE THAT. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS THAT PROPOSAL FOR UNIVERSAL. PRE K. WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A GOOD ASPIRATIONAL GOAL I I SUPPORT THAT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THE NOTION IS THAT WE SHOULD FIND AT THE MINIMUM ALL EXISTING INCOME ELIGIBLE. THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SO -- WHAT'S NEEDED TO TO ACHIEVE THAT THAT GOAL AND AND HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE AND WHAT ARE THE THE PIECES THAT WE NEED. TO PUT IN PLACE. TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. FROM HAVING A FINANCED CD E. THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL PRE K. PLAN IS IS MUCH SLOW AND METHODICAL SO THE IDEA IS TO FIRST FIND THE LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WHICH WE HAVE CALCULATED AT THERE'S AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND THAT STILL. DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO SERVICES AT ALL SO THE PLAN TO ROLL THAT OUT BY TEN THOUSAND SLOTS EACH YEAR IS PART OF THAT SLOW AND METHODICAL ROLLOUT OF GETTING TO UNIVERSAL PRE K.. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS OUT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF SERVING THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS ON IN THIS BUDGET IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF BUDGETS. AND BESIDES THE NUMBER AT SLOTS -- WHAT'S NEEDED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE KNOW THAT. AS THE TO PART OF AN MENTIONED. WE'VE HAD ROUGHLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SLOTS PROVIDE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE LAST. THIS OUR FIFTH YEAR DOING WORKING ON THOSE. A BUDGET INCREASES. AND WE'VE HAD SOME LIMITATIONS WITH ELEAZAR BECAUSE OF RATES JUST RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE'RE FACING THAT BUDGET CRISIS IN MY HOME DISTRICT HERE AT SAKS CITY. GRANT HAS ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES ABOUT THAT BUT ONE THING THAT WE'RE REALIZING. IS THERE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. IS THAT IT WAS BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THEIR GENERAL FUND AND THE RATE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE WASN'T VIABLE TO TO TO MAKE IT WORK. AND SO THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE PROBABLY ISSUES ALL ACROSS THE STATE AS FAR AS OUR OF OUR OVERALL -- FUNDING TO MAKE SURE WE YOU KNOW PAY THE WORKERS ADEQUATE WAGES AND FOCUSING ON THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND CONTRACTS AND QUALITY ISSUES THAT SOMEONE MEMBER LIMO AND TALKED ABOUT SO. BESIDES LOTS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. TO MAKE -- THOSE SLOTS VIABLE FOR BOTH ELEAZAR AND CBS. GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS GIVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK I ONE OF THE ISSUES ARE AND THAT'S ON THE AGENDA AND LATER IS THE TREE TO STRATEGIC PLAN THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK IN THE STATE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF WHERE. WHERE THE -- HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEED AS AND THEN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO WE NEED AS A STAKE IN ORDER TO BUILD THE CAPACITY AT THAT LEVEL RATES AND IS CERTAINLY PART OF THAT CONVERSATION -- BUT IT'S REALLY A HOLISTIC LOOK. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES -- THAT NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND START SUPPORTING THESE CHILDREN I'M IN WITH REGARD TO PRESCHOOL AGAIN I THINK -- WE JUST NEED IS A STATE OF PLANNED WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE SLOTS WHERE THE PRESCHOOL SLOTS ARE NEEDED. WHAT IT COSTS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S? IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER. I I I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS AN ALLEY A FROM WEST CONTRA COSTA AND A CBO. BUT I THINK THEY WOULD SAY THAT -- WE WE KIND OF KNOW. BASED UPON IS THOUGHT TO BE PUTTING OUT LAST FOR YEARS. WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE SO WHAT'S THE -- THE APPETITE FOR THE MINISTRATION IN ADDITION TO HAVING THAT A PLAN BECAUSE THE PLAN REALLY IS THAT THE UNIVERSAL ASPECT AS WELL. HOW YOU DO IT NOT JUST FOR ALL LOW INCOME KIDS BUT ALL -- FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA AND REVENUE IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THERE BUT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM. WHAT ABOUT -- THE RATE STRUCTURE DO WE THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE WITH THE EXISTING SLOTS THERE'S NEWS LOTS PROPOSED MASTERS BUDGET IN THE SLOTS WE'VE JUST -- APPROVE THE LAST -- TWO BUDGET YEARS THREE BUT YEARS. YOU'RE GONNA HATE THIS ANSWER BUT I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE -- ANY ANY COMMENT ON THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME HOWEVER I THINK THIS GOVERNOR THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT EARLY LEARNING CARE. AND THE SPORTS GIVEN TO YOUNG CHILDREN IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND A HIGH PRIORITY SO I THINK TO THAT EXTENT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE CONVERSATIONS. OUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD SURE I THINK THIS IS SOMEWHAT CAM PARABLE TO YOU KNOW THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU GIVE SOMEBODY. A MEDICAL CARD AND SAY HERE YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE. UNIT ALONG IF THEY DON'T HAVE. THAT A DOCTOR CLINIC TO MAKE THAT -- WORK IN ITS IT'S HAVE AN EMPTY PROMISE I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS EMPTY BUT WE WOULDN'T DO THINK ABOUT THE SAME THING WE'VE BEEN INCREASING SLOTS AND THEY'VE BEEN COMING BACK FROM THE ELLIE I ELLIE A SIDE FOR SEVERAL REASONS AND WE NEED. TO OWN THAT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS AND ALSO -- HERE FROM THAT FOR THE NOT ONLY A SO WE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE THERE AS AS WE GO FORWARD -- SO WITH THAT OF MR TING. OR JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I I THINK IF. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR NUMBER YEARS BEEN A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY AROUND -- PRESCHOOLS IF THERE ARE OPEN SLOTS I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHETHER THOSE SLOTS ARE BETTER SHIFTED TO NON DALY ETS -- WHO SEEM TO HAVE A LONG WAITING LIST SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS IF? THE NON ELEAZAR SAYING HOW WE'RE WE'RE FINE TOO BUT THEY IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT LEAST IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT THE TO TO HAVE A FAIRLY LONG WAIT LIST. FOR DEMAND SO AGAIN IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THE SLOTS THAT ARE FUNDED IT TO SIT EMPTY -- RATHER THAN TO FIND THE WHERE THE NEED IS AND REALLY HOW BEST WE CAN SERVICE THAT NEED. IF IF FOR EXAMPLE IS MISSED MCCARTY SAID. REALLY. APPS LA AREN'T AREN'T BEST PROVIDED TO SERVE THIS. PARTICULAR NEED WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT ELSE ARE OUR OPTIONS. AND THAT THAT NUMBER THIRTY THOUSAND WE THINK THAT'S ACCURATE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT ARE. THAT ARE NOT SERVED WITH HEAD START STATE PRESCHOOL NTK WHEN THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN. YES THIRTY THOUSAND NUMBERS JUST LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED BETTER ON SERVE CURRENTLY BY ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT. HAVE EDUCATIONAL FOUR YEAR OLDS AND BUT JUST FOR YOUR OWN WHAT DO YOU BASE THAT ON DOT IS BASED ON ENROLLMENT NUMBERS IN HEAD START AND T. K. AND THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE POPULATION OF FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE. I KNOW INCOME WHAT I MEAN WHERE WAS THAT RESEARCH DONE WHAT REPORTERS THAT FRIENDS YOU KNOW. THAT'S THAT'S OUR RESEARCH LOOKING AT JUST THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS IN COMING UP WITH THAT NUMBER ON OUR END OKAY. THAT'S A HARD NUMBER TO PIN DOWN. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL HERE FROM THE PROVIDERS OF THESE STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTS FROM THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE. AS WELL AS A CBO SO WITH THAT WE HAVE. PAGE IS THAT ON WE HAVE A ROBIN LAYTON FERMENT EDUCATION RICHMOND SERVICES THE STATE PRISCO THAT CONTRACT PROVIDER IN SAN DIEGO IN FROM THE WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. A MISS LINE RAY. A JOCKEY. THE RIGHT YES OKAY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. YES WILL START WITH THE SCHOOLS COULD HAVE GOOD MONEY MISTER CHAIR AB ACTUALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON SOMETHING I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT -- WCCO AS THE C. S. B. B. CURRENTLY PROVIDES THIRTEEN PARTY AND TWO FULL DAYS PROGRAMS. AND THE FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AT PARIS AND CORONADO. TO ELIGIBLE CHILDREN OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE FAMILIES ACCESS SITES HAVE LOW INCOME. OUR OWN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. THE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IN REACH ONE I AM TRIANGLE WE ARE ONE OF A FULL DAY PROGRAM IS LOCATED IMMIGRATION ISSUES HI CRIME ENVIRONMENT. LOW FAMILY EDUCATION THAT ATTAINMENT AND SOMETIMES DRUG USE THAT IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN'S LEARNING. OUR PROGRAM PROVIDES A CRITICAL HEAVEN FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO ACQUIRE THE NECESSITY FOR INDIGENOUS SKILLS. THAT ENABLE SCHOOL SUCCESS. 77% OF OUR CHILDREN ARE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. I'M GOOD I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE DISTRICT I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON THE PRESCHOOL AND THE FULL DAY PROGRAM BECAUSE OF PILOT THIRTY FOR TWO YEARS. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE SUCCESSES I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE. THAT REALLY DOING THE JOB NOT RESEARCH ALL JUST FROM ASKING. QUESTIONS SO I WENT TO TALK TO YOU. ABOUT THE SUCCESS IS THAT WE HAVE HAD. I PROGRAM PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. ALL UP PROGRAMS IS THAT YES FIVE ON FOR FROM THE CARROTS SO I HAVE WE HAVE SEVEN FIVE TWO OF FIVE PROGRAMS. AND IT'S TEMPLE. SITES. OUR LAST SB TO JAVA FULLY CREDENTIALED AND THEY HAVE THAT YOU SEE APARTMENTS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THE STATE IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. ARE WE HAVE. EXTENSIVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND THEREFORE THAT'S AFFECT IN THE PROS -- THE PRODUCT OF THE KIDS THAT THAT AT THAT WE ARE PRODUCING MY TO MY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS. AB FROM PRESCHOOL MEDS EARLY LITERACY BENCHMARK IN SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IF YOU LOOK AT GO PUBLIC. SCHOOL OF WEST CONTRA COSTA PAGE TWENTY SIX IS THERE. THERE ARE NONE PUBLIC -- ORGANIZATION. I ENROLLMENT PRACTICES. AFTER ANOTHER MINUTE WE ADVERTISE IN LOOKOUT MAGAZINES. OUR MOVIE THEATER. LEARNED REMARKS STALLS FIFTH BEST -- AGENCIES. WE ALSO HAVE ACADEMIC CONFERENCING WE HAVE TIME FOR PLANNING WITH TEACHERS DURING SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL SO WE HAVE. EXCELLENT. FAMILY INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE. TO IMPROVE THE LITERACY OF ARCADES WE HAVE -- READY FOR KIDS IS A TEXT MESSAGE THE SAGE THAT WAS SENT TO PERRANCE. SO THAT THEY CAN -- WALK WITH THEIR KIDS AT HOME. WE ALSO HAVE NEWSLETTER AS WE HAVE MAGAZINES WE HAVE PARENTS TRAINING SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. FOR A PRESCHOOL CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. IN GIVEN LAST STUDENTS FULL DAY PROGRAM IT'S WELL NEED THAT BECAUSE OUR PARENTS REALLY NEED. A FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IS LIKE STARTING A NEW BUSINESS. GOING THROUGH ALL THE REGULATIONS. AND ALSO FIGURING OUT THE BENEFITS WHY CHILDREN. FOR EXAMPLE IF PERRANCE -- I'M NOT IN SCHOOL. ALL THE ITEMS THAT CAN FOR JOBS THEY DON'T QUALIFY. BUT IT'S A NEEDED SERVICE THAT'S ONE ALSO BE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR KIDS. THERE IS NO WAY A SCHOOL DISTRICT COME PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR TO SIX DAYS. OF SERVICES TO CHILDREN. THERE'S NO WAY MOST ADMINISTRATORS WERE FOR TWO HUNDRED FIVE DAYS. SO THAT WILL BE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT OF THE SITES SO. IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT ASKING FOR THE SLOTS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT GREEN. IT IS THAT SORRY INTERRUPT YOU YES YOU THINK THAT THE TOP REASON THAT'S A TOP PRISON. I HAVE HAD SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TRYING TO WORK WITH MARK I'M NOT LEAST ON THIS ISSUE. YEAH TO THE EXTENT THAT. YEAH I HAVE BEEN CAN YOU GO BACK AND YEAH I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE CAN YES EXPLAINED TO US IN THE PUBLIC MORE ABOUT THAT. THE LOG. AND THE OBLIGATION FOR STATE PRESCHOOL TO BE. HOW TO HAVE MORE DAYS THAN THE TRADITIONAL YOU THEN YOUR KINDERGARTNERS FIRST GRADE AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT OKAY PLACE SCHOOL DISTRICTS? BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACT ISSUES WITH TEACHERS. HE DOES HAVE TO GO ON HOLIDAYS THAT'S ONE WE HAVE TO HAVE -- NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNION. BECAUSE THE TWO DOES HAVE TO BE PAID EXTRA. WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH. HE MERRY SAYS DEPARTMENT SO THAT THE TEACHERS. CAN COME BACK AND TEACH THE KIDS OUT OF THAT AFTER THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS OF SCHOOL. SO IT'S A LOT OF THEIR AND ALSO WE NEED MOST OF THE SITESARE A DIFFERENT SITE. THEY'RE NOT IN THE CENTER SO WE NEED ADMINISTRATIVE COVERAGE AND THE PRINT AND THE PRINCE WAS OUT ON HOLIDAYS. SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT THE BEST THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DAYS THAT THESE. UP TILL JUNE. THEN ABOUT TWENTY DAYS AFTER JUNE. END OF JUNE THE BEST THAT CAN PROVIDE BECAUSE OF SUMMER SCHOOL. THAT YOU CAN HAVE ADMINISTRATORS SO NEGOTIATING WITH THE AND I LEAST. IT'S IT'S REALLY TOUGH I'M THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT. LOOKING FOR THE SLOTS IS NOT BECAUSE HERE'S NO MONEY IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT NEED THAT BUT THAT'S THE MAJOR REASON. BUT ISN'T IT A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE IF YOU. HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE YOURS THIS. BECOME MORE FINANCIALLY VIABLE AND HAPPIER DAYS. THEN YOU MAY HAVE PARENTS WHO SAY WELL ONE MILLION YOU FOR THOSE TWO MONTHS DURING THE SUMMER LOOK AT WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT GOOD. FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THE THE PARENTS HAVE KIDS WELL OLDER SIBLINGS THEY WANT TO GO ON VACATION. SO DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND ROMANCE IS REALLY LOW. THE BILL. HOLD ON TO THE SPOT BUT THEY'LL GO ON VACATION. AND SOME OF THEM GO TO MEXICO FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS. YEAH SO WHAT ARE THE WHAT ABOUT% THE ONES WHO DON'T GO ON BECAUSE OKAY WHO ARE IN THE POVERTY AND DON'T. HAVE THE YOSEMITE OPTION OKAY SO MY OKAY. OKAY MY THING IS WHAT WHAT WHAT WE TELL THEM FOR THE OKAY MY CITIES AND I AND I I'M VERY. OPEN TO THIS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ASK YEAH I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK MESSAGES WHAT'S THE GOAL WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A DO YOU WANT TO PREPARE THE KIDS. SO THAT THEY CAN BE READY FOR KINDERGARTEN OR DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH. DAYCARE. SO IS THERE WHAT WE CAN DO REFERENCE SERVICES. FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT IT'S NOT. OUR SCHOOL BASED. BECAUSE IF THE GOAL IS TO GIVE THEM THE ACADEMIC -- FOUNDATION OF SKILLS THEY NEED THEN WE NEED THE SERVICES BUT IF THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE DAYCARE. THEN THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY. OKAY SO. I MEAN I INTERRUPTED YOUR PRESENTATION NO THAT'S FOR AN ISSUE MAYBE LET'S GO BACK YEAH YEAH THAT'S OKAY -- ALSO DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WE ALSO HAVE TO REPAIR THE SCHOOL SITES DEEP CLEANING. YOU KNOW THOSE YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT I LIKE I SAID. WHAT MADE YOU WE ARE THE ADMINISTRATORS -- TO TO BE AT THE SITE [inaudible] ARM. I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. BUT OVERALL HE SAID NEED AT PROGRAM ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HEAD START YOU NEED TO VISIT OUT OUR PROGRAM I WISH THAT YOU COULD. COME AND VISIT THE PROGRAM YOU SEE THREE YELLED OUT FOR YELLS READING ALREADY. I I I I I CAN. TESTIFY TO THAT SO IF THAT'S THE GOAL IF YOU WANT HIGH QUALITY PROGRAM. WE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED. OKAY THANK YOU YOU WELCOME. PLACE THANK YOU HIGH -- ROBIN LAYTON THAT. THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF EDUCATIONAL RICHMOND SYSTEMS AND DIEGO WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION OR A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION OR A NON ELLIE. EIGHT AND WE'RE CELEBRATING FORTY YEARS THIS YEAR. I'VE BEEN WITH THE ORGANIZATION THIRTY FIVE YEARS SO I JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES BEHIND ME AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS A VERY EXCITING YEAR FOR US. SO -- I'VE BEEN AT THIS TABLE -- OVER THE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN AS EXCITING AS IT IS TODAY SO THANK YOU. IN OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE -- TWENTY ONE EARLY EDUCATION CENTERS WE SERVE ABOUT A HUNDRED ELEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS A DAY. AND WE SERVE THEM IN BOTH FULL AND PART DAY PROGRAMS WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH US TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE THEY GIVE US WE ARE -- OPEN UP -- STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR THREE HOURS. AND WE THEY GIVE US A ROOM WE GIVE THEM READY CHILDREN WE ALSO HAVE THE NEED BASED PROGRAM WHICH IS -- WE HAVE SEVEN OF THOSE SCHOOLS AND THAT IS THE PROGRAM THAT IS YEAR ROUND FULL DAY. AND WE'RE TALKING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS A YEAR OVER TEN HOURS A DAY. AND THAT IS -- SEEMS TO BE WHAT OUR FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NEED WE PROVIDE A BREAKFAST LUNCH AFTERNOON SNACKS SO THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING NUTRITIOUS MEALS. WE ARE ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY SERVES A WE STARTED EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND GO TO FIVE YEARS WE ACTUALLY DID WHEN I STARTED AND UP UNTIL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE SERVED. IN FENCE BUT WE HAD TO GIVE THAT UP DUE TO BUDGET CUTS SOME HOPE WERE -- ACTUALLY APPLIED TO BRING THAT BACK. EVERYTHING THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE SAID OVER HERE AS FAR AS THE PROGRAM. WHERE EXACTLY THE SAME SO WE ALSO HAVE A PART OF THE Q. R. S. AND OUR PROGRAMS ARE ALSO A TIER FIVE IN? FOR ALL OF THE STATE MANDATES REGARDING THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS AND WHAT THE CHILDREN ARE PROVIDED. IS EXACTLY THE SAME WE HAVE THE SAME RATIO SO FOR PRESCHOOL TO ONE TO EIGHT FOR TODDLERS IT'S A WONDER FOR AND FOR INSTANCE IT'S A ONE TO THREE WERE CONSIDERED A TITLE -- FIVE ORGANIZATION AND I ALSO FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT NOT ONLY DO I SERVE ELEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS I EMPLOY OUR ORGANIZATION EMPLOYS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT'S QUITE A BIT. WE HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN BUILDING AND RENOVATING SCHOOLS JUST THIS LAST YEAR THROUGH PRIVATE DONATIONS OF BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR THE RENOVATIONS WE OPENED UP OUR NEW A SCHOOL. AND WITH IN A DAY IT WAS FULL AND MOST OF THOSE STUDENTS CAME FROM. OUR EXISTING PART DAY BECAUSE THOSE FAMILIES NEEDED FULL DAY. AND SIBLINGS BECAUSE WE DID WE DO SERVE TO A TWO YEAR OLDS OVER THERE. SO I WON'T GET INTO ALL OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE DID MENTION ALL OF THAT BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW OUR PROGRAMS. THE CURRICULUM IS RESEARCH BASED. ALL THE WAY FROM BIRTH TO AGE. FIVE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE STUDENTS ARE IN A PROGRAM FOR THREE HOURS OR TEN HOURS THEY GET THE SAME PROGRAM ACTUALLY THEY GET MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL DAY. AND THEY GET MORE NUTRITIOUS MEALS AS WELL. ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT THAT WE HAVE. CREATED AND THIS IS ALSO THROUGH A PRIVATE GRANT THAT WE RECEIVED. THROUGH THE SAN DIEGO SOUND FOUNDATION WHICH I'M I'M HOPING ALL OF YOU HEARD THAT IN OUR COUNTY -- THE FOUNDATION RECEIVED AT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO LOOK AT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN OUR IN OUR COUNTY AND I'M ONE OF FOUR AGENCIES THAT BENEFITTED FROM THIS. FROM THIS GRANT IN ITS TO LOOK AT WAYS TO EXPAND AS WELL AS PROVIDING SUPPORT SERVICES SO -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- HEAD START PROGRAM HAS IS -- OUR FAMILY LIAISONS BUT OUR STATE FUNDING DOESN'T PAY FOR THAT SO WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE. TO A POSITIONS WERE FAMILY LIAISONS. AND EARLIER SOMEBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT WE ARE TIME OF THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION SO OUR LIAISONS AS WELL AS OUR HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF ARE CURRENTLY. IDENTIFYING THESE CHILDREN EARLY AND IF THEY HAVE NEEDS WE'VE CREATED A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHERE -- MOM AND DAD OR AN UNCLE OR GRANDMA WHOEVER'S DROPPING OFF THE CHILD AT SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING. CAN NOW GO TO WORK AT TEN O'CLOCK A BUSTLE COM FOR SOME OF THESE CHILDREN BECOME UP TAKEN TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BRING THEM BACK CHILD GETS LUNCH THAT. AFTERNOON PLAY MOM PICKS THEM UP. FIVE BY [inaudible] THIRTY AND DIDN'T MISS A BEAT DIDN'T MISS DIDN'T MISS WORK SO THIS PRO THESE PROGRAMS THESE FULL DAY YEAR ROUND PROGRAMS FOR BIRTH THROUGH. FIVE OUR ALLOWING CHILDREN TO LEARN AND PARENTS TO EARN. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT -- ALL OF THIS EXPANSION SO -- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT HERE I AM AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. UP. IN OUR OPINION WE BELIEVE THAT ALL UP BEFORE WE SERVE EVERY FOUR YEAR OLD IN THIS STATE. WE NEED TO SERVE ALL CHILDREN BIRTH THROUGH FIVE WITH THE PEROT PRIORITY GIVEN TO WORKING FAMILIES [inaudible] OF WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL CURRENT MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND THE TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS. ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT OFFER THE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS FOR THE CHILDREN WHERE -- RESEARCH TO SAYING THAT IF CHILDREN ARE IN THESE PROGRAMS. THEY ARE -- GOING TO BE. READY FOR KINDERGARTEN. WE STILL DO NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN SO PARENTS CAN GO TO WORK AND SO THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO AGAIN OUR PRIORITY IS BIRTH THROUGH. FIVE OF WE ALSO STRONGLY STRONGLY SO -- RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CONTINUE WITH THE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATIONAL QUALITY STANDARDS NEVER LOWER THE STANDARDS TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN. EVER. THAT THAT'S I THINK IS -- WOULD BE A CRIME TO OUR TO OUR STUDENTS -- WE NEED TO INCREASE RATES IN ORDER TO GET TO RATE WAGE PARITY WITH CANDOR KEEP CAN -- TEACHERS FOR ALREADY EXISTING QUALIFIED STAFF. THEY ARE ALREADY PROFESSIONAL THEY'RE ALREADY CORRECT CREDENTIALED. AND WE NEED TO STOP PAYING POVERTY WAGES THESE PROGRAMS. ARE PROGRAMS THIS THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TITLE FIVE CENTERS. ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED ON THE BACKS OF THE PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS WHO ARE ACCEPTING LOW WAGES. AND I'M THE ONE THAT TOLD YOU THAT I'VE LOST STAFF TO COSTCO BECAUSE THEY PAY MORE. AND THEY OFFER BENEFITS AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND ONE LAST THING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ANOTHER PLAN WHEN IT CAN BE GOING TO INVESTMENTS FOR A HIGHER WAGES. SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT THERE I WOULD ASK YOU FROM THE NON LA PERSPECTIVE. ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS YES THAT WOULD THAT WE SERVE -- KIDS IN THESE PROGRAMS SELF. OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE LEAN AND MEAN. THAN A SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND SO HOW IS IT THAT -- CBO SICK AND CAN FIGURE IT OUT. BUT SWELLED MAYBE HAVE A TOUGH WEEK I THINK THE THE ANSWER IS THEY'VE ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT BECAUSE SERRA JUST MENTION. THAT. SHE RECEIVED FUNDING REQUESTS FOR A HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS. TO EXPAND INFANT TODDLERS WE WE APPLY FOR THOSE GRANTS DOT I GET THAT HAVE YET I MEAN THE NUMBER OF DAYS. THE THE DAYS THE CALENDAR DEAL WE'RE NOT HONEST WHAT WERE THE THE FULL DAY PROGRAMS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT PROPERTY SO WE TAKE EVERYTHING IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A SCHOOL WHERE WE TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTODIAL THE INSURANCE. THE FOOD WE HAVE KITCHENS ON SITES WE TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING BUT I TELL YOU SERVING BUT THE NUMBER AGAIN 200- AND THIS ARE YEP WORKER BUT EVEN FIFTY DAYS YEAH WE ALSO HAVE LIKE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE WE HAVE. OF THE PART DAY PROGRAMS WERE WERE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. THOSE CHILDREN ONLY GET THREE HOURS THEIR BAG OPEN MORE FOR THE FULL DAY IF YOU IF YOU LOOKED AT CHULA VISTA SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SAN DIEGO AND YOU CAN YOUR AREA AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE THE SAME. THEY'RE CLOSING THEIR FULL DAY PROGRAM SEEM ISSUES WE HERE AT OUR WEST CONTRA COSTA SO ARE THEIR WAGES. DIFFERENT ARE THERE YEAH AND IF IT'S DIFFERENT YEAH WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE ISSUES SO. SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SALARIES ARE BASED ON CONTRACTS AND THEY HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS SO I THINK IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED THE PACKED. A CAREER KAREEM IF HE'S STILL HERE I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A BENEFIT PACKAGE AS A NON PROFIT AND THE CBO. LIKE I SAID INSTEAD OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUBSIDIZING. THE SALARIES NOBODY IS AND SO WE HAVE TURNED OVER AND WE PAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR WITH NO BENEFITS WAS AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT PAYING COSCO WAGES. RIGHT NO THEY YEAH YEAH THAT'S A POINT PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL WAGES WE HAVE THIS DILEMMA WERE IT SQUEEZES -- THE BUDGET TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE NINE HUNDRED FORTY CALENDAR DAY SELL RIGHT SO. DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT THAT THAT WE DO DODD WELL THANK YOU SURE WE HAVE THE L. A.'S HATE LOWER WELL ADEQUATELY. NO. NOTHING WE NEED WE HAVE HOW DO WE FIX THIS ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT. ELLIE AIDS CAN ALSO HAVE A FINANCIALLY VIABLE YEAR ROUND OR DO WE I I DON'T KNOW THE DATES YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN BE USABLE THE I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE BUSINESS UP THERE IN IS TO DO ALL. DAY YEAR ROUND CHILD CARE. SO I DON'T I I DON'T KNOW BUT I IN OUR TOWN THE A LOT OF THE MARK ARE CLOSING THE FULL DAY AND THEY'RE KEEPING THE PART DAY. MORE COST EFFECTIVE -- BUT THEY ALL ARE THEY ARE ALSO SUBSIDIZING THE SALARIES FOR US WE I WAS ON THE RATES COMMITTEE. AND THAT WHITE PAPER REAR CLEARLY SAYS HOW WE CAN SOLVE THE RATES ISSUE SO THAT OUR TEACHERS COULD EVENTUALLY GET TO THE SAME LEVEL OF KINDERGARTEN SALARIES. SO THAT'S WHERE I WOULD TO A THAT'S WHERE. I WOULD PUT THE MONEY RATES FIRST. AND THEN SLOTS AND FACILITIES TOGETHER IN. I NOT MAKE YOU THINK IF HE HAD THE RATE REFORM WITH THE HIGHER. RATE YOU'D BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE THE THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT ELEAZAR. YES FROM MY ORGANIZATION WE PUT IN A REQUEST FOR SEVENTY THREE INFANTS AND TODDLERS I HAVE THE FACILITIES READY TO GO. LITTLE BIT A RENOVATION AND WE PUT IN FOR FOUR HUNDRED STATE PRESCHOOL STUDENTS FULL DAY YEAR ROUND. OKAY SO THAT'S WELL THE FULL DAY PROGRAM IS HIGHLY NEEDED PARENTS ARE NOT LOOKING FOR YOU. AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY AT LEAST. SO I BELIEVE THAT. DISTRICTS NEED FULL DAY PROGRAM IS JUST A NUMBER OF DAYS AND IF WE LOOK AT THE LAW THE LAW IT SAYS THAT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE. THE NUMBER OF DAYS YOU CAN PROVIDE. SO INSISTENT ON THOSE TOMORROW FOUR TO SIX DAYS. IT'S IT'S THAT'S WHY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT LOOKING. FOR THE CRACKED BECAUSE THERE IS NO SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT DOES NOT IN THE BEST IT CAN PROVIDE HISTORICALLY TO ONE DAYS. YEAH THE ACT AN **** SALARIES MY THAT'S A JOB THAT PAID YOU KNOW JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHER LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IT DEPENDS ON YOUR QUALIFICATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR CREDENTIAL AND THEY HAVE THE AC UNITS. SO THEY'RE HIGHLY PAID THE PROBLEM THESE ALL THE MONEY THAT WE GET FROM THE STATE GOES TOWARDS SALARIES AND BENEFITS. AN INDIRECT COSTSO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY -- TO SEND THEM A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE KRS FUNDING. COMES IN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE USING TO BUY MATERIALS ARE ALSO TO DO PT'S. THAT'S HOW AND BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT [inaudible] OKAY. SO WITH THAT WHAT WOULD A DIFFERENTIAL. PHOEBE APPROPRIATE FOR ELEAZAR TO PROVIDE THAT THIS SUMMER. YEAH. I THINK THAT. IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO TO HAVE. THE PARTICIPANTS. BE WITH YOU FOR TEN MONTHS AND THEN -- GO ACROSS THE STREET TO THE CBO FOR THE OTHER TWO MONTHS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU KNOW ONE YEAR LATER WHEN KIDS ARE IN KINDERGARTEN OR T. K.. YOU DON'T HAVE THE FOUR YEAR YOU DO THAT THAT THIS ORDER NUMBER A DAY YEAH WE SELL WE HAVE FULL OF FOOD AND A FULL WILL NOT TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX DAYS NO I MEAN I TOSS MY POINT. SO ONE YEAR LATER. THE PARENTS ARE DEALING WITH THAT THE THAT THE ISSUE OF HAVING THIS ORDER NUMBER DAY BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BENEFITS. ARE YOU PREPARING KATE TO TO REDUCE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ARE YOU PROVIDING DAYCARE SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BENEFITS SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW LIKE. A RIDGES THAT SHIPMENT GAP I DO ALSO LEAD TO PROVIDE -- HE'S WITH THE KINDERGARTEN READINESS SKILLS THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IT'S IS A DAYCARE BY YOU WANT OR IS THE DO YOU WANT THE KIDS TO BE REDEEMED. BY THOUGHT GREAT SO HAVE TO WEIGH THE BENEFITS GET. AS THE GOOD QUESTIONS THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER LIMóN. THANK YOU AT WHAT. YOU'VE BROUGHT UP A LOT OF THE BOTH OF YOU AND IN PREVIOUS PANEL -- HAVE BROUGHT UP A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT GO HAND IN HAND THE STATE HAS CLEARLY MADE AN INVESTMENT -- I GET IT NOT ENOUGH -- ON THE NUMBER OF SPOTS BUT WE'VE ALSO NOW IDENTIFIED THAT THERE'S GREATER SUBSTANTIAL CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S DAY LONG THE TRAINING IS IT SYSTEM WIDE OR YOU KNOW -- AND I SAID A WORD THAT I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD EXIST. IS THERE A SYSTEM -- STRUCTURE IN PLACE NOW TO HAVE THE WORK FORCE HAVE A LARGER STATEWIDE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS RELATED TO SPACE. RELATED TO THE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES RELATED TO DAY LONG NOT THE LONG THE TRAINING THE WORK FORCE I MEAN. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT. WE INVEST IN THE NUMBER OF SPOTS. AND WE FIND OURSELVES NOW WITH THE CHALLENGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS BECAUSE AS YOU'VE FOR CHILD CARE AS YOU'VE SAID. COSTCO PAYS MORE -- AND TO WORK WITH A LITTLE HUMAN BEING IS MUCH HARDER -- THEN YOU KNOW. OTHER JOBS -- IN SO WHAT SYSTEM OR STRUCTURE EXIST IS IN PLACE AT THE MOMENT TO ADDRESS THIS. WELL I I THINK THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION JUST CAME OUT WITH A REPORT THAT. GIVES US ALL THE ANSWERS ON HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT INVESTING IN EARLY EDUCATION. FROM NOW ON THE CURRENT MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM -- IT IS WORKING FOR WORKING FAMILIES EXCEPT FOR THE FAT AND AND THE TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS WHICH WERE BOTH TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CBO -- SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ARE EDUCATING THE CHILDREN. THE ISSUE IS -- RATES TO INCREASE [inaudible] THE WAGES. OUR STAFF THEY THEY ARE ACCEPTING LOW WAGES BUT THEY ARE THEY ARE CREDENTIALED AND PROFESSIONAL MANY OF THEM MOST OF THEM THE MAJORITY OF MY TEACHERS HAVE THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREES. SO YES WE DO ANNUAL PAT OF A PROFESSIONAL GROWTH -- WE ARE PART OF THE Q. R. S. SYSTEM WHICH IS OF VERY EXCELLENT RATING SYSTEM THAT -- IF YOU GET TO A FOUR FIVE YOU ARE THAT'S A QUALITY PROGRAM THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE IN. WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT. OTHER RESEARCH IS SAYING THEY NEED TO BE IN. SO INCREASE IN THE RATES AND THEN FACILITIES AND THEN SPOTS. OKAY WELL FOR ME AS I STILL BELIEVE THAT IF YOU GUYS REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WE NEED TO GO. AND ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IN THE FIELD. BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN DOES ME YOU RECITE CHEESE FROM DOES ASK IN THE FEW PEOPLE WHO NEED TO ACTUALLY GO AND MEET WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY DOING THE JOB BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE THE FACTS WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING. THAT'S AND I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT AT PEACE TO A I KNOW CERTAINLY THIS YEAR THERE IS A CONVERSATION BEING HAD IN THE LEGISLATURE -- THROUGH A BILL -- THAT WOULD DO THIS HOW DO WE GET THE WORK FORCE AT THE TABLE IN A MORE SYSTEMIC WAY I THINK THAT AT YOU KNOW WHAT ECHOES IN MY MIND IS -- SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL BE REPEATED. ON MORE THAN JUST THIS OCCASION IN THIS HEARING WHICH IS THAT CHILD CARE WORKERS MAKE LESS THAN ACOSTA WORKER -- AND I A HOPE AND THAT AS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WE CAN ALSO -- WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE WORK FORCE HAS GOT TO BE AT THE TABLE WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT WE CAN INVEST ALL KINDS OF MONEY -- IN SPOTS BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND AND THE NEED WE WERE FAILING OUR KIDS. WE ARE FAILURE KIDDING AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS -- UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT I THINK WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE WORK FORCE ITSELF THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR KIDS -- AND WE HAVE A MAJOR QUESTION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK DO WE JUST WANT CHILD CARE OR DO WE WANT THESE KIDS TO BE READY FOR KINDERGARTEN AND FOR SCHOOL -- AND THAT THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME THING AND THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT THE SAME THING -- I THINK WE ARE CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO DEMAND A GREATER WHICH IS TO PREPARE OUR KIDS FOR KINDERGARTEN AND FOR SCHOOL -- AND IN THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT'S READY THAT'S WILLING THAT AT THE TABLE TO HELP US. I DO YOU KNOW SOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE GREATER THAN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO COVER ANY HEARING WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DETERMINE -- WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WHAT THE IMPACT LOOKS LIKE BETWEEN A HALF -- TO FOR THE FULL DAY -- WITHIN THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA -- SOME YOU KNOW AS WE HEARD. I THINK. YOU KNOW THE CHAIR BUT THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- TALK ABOUT THAT THE BIGGEST NEED IS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- FOR FULL DAY PRESCHOOL A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. WE HAVE TO START EVEN BEFORE THAT HOW YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT SO I HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WILL DO THAT -- I I KNOW THAT I FOR ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE CONVERSATIONS GO HAND IN HAND AND NOT ISOLATE THE CONVERSATIONS I'M A BUT THEY HAVE TO GO HAND IN HAND BECAUSE IF WE DO AN INVESTMENT AND WE DON'T HAVE THE WORK FIRST THAT'S ABLE. AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND OR NEED -- I I DON'T THINK WE ARE SERVING -- THE KIDS THAT CALIFORNIA KIDS THAT OUR FUTURE AND THE KIDS THAT DESERVE AT TO BE FULL SERVE TO THE FULLEST IN THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT WAS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE NEXT IN THE WORK FORCE -- AGENDA ITEM BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT TO PROFESSIONAL EYES WORKFORCE I'M I'M FULLY SUPPORT THAT AND WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATION BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF OF OUR THREE BILL. PACKAGE WHICH IS HANNAH HAND WITH HIS PROPOSAL WHICH I KNOW YOU SUPPORT AS WELL. IS IS TALKING ABOUT A PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORK FORCE AS FAR AS COMPENSATION AND AND MAKE SURE IT'S NOT JUST IN AND OUT IT'S NOT JUST COSCO WAGES IT'S AN OUT FOR AGES. AND SOME OF THE WORKERS QUALIFY LITERALLY FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE SERVING. THE KIDS AND SELL JUST MAKES YOU SCRATCH YOUR HEAD. AND IT'S MAKE IT'S MAKING SURE THE PROGRAMS ARE -- ARE VIABLE AND BRINGING UP THE QUALITY STANDARDS AND SO PART OF OUR BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IS ALSO PART OF A LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN STREAMLINE AND SIMPLIFY. THE RATE STRUCTURES BUT ALSO RAISE THE RATES AS WELL AS IMPROVE QUALITY AND I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY. IN HELPING THE WORK FORCE -- NOTE. HELP IN THE WORK FORCE NOT EARN POVERTY WAGES AND MAKE IT AND NOT HAVE SO MUCH TURNOVER. IMPROVE QUALITY BUT ALSO MAKE THE PROGRAMS MORE VIABLE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TURN MONEY BACK TO THE STATE IS RESIDENTS WE TALKED HALF HOUR ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND SLOTS UNLESS YOU HAVE THIS THIRD PIECE THE FIRST PIECE DOESN'T QUITE. PENCIL OUT JUST SIMPLE MATHEMATICS ABSOLUTELY -- SO SO THIS IS AS AS YOU SAID EARLIER IS AS EXCITING THAT WERE HIT IN MARCH IS A POOR MARCH. MARCH MARCH MARCH. WE ARE NEVER IN MARCH TALKING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IS LOTS ROW IS NOT TALKING ABOUT IT MAY REVISE AND WE JAMMED IN THE BUDGET AFTER THE GOVERNOR COMES OUT HIS BUDGET SAID TO BE AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE A GOVERNOR LEANING IN ON THIS ISSUE AND TALKING ABOUT THESE INVESTMENTS AT THIS POINT THE BUDGET PROCESS IS REALLY EXCITING -- I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OUT THE DETAILS AND MOVE PIECES HEARING HERE AND THERE BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY PLEASE THAT WE ARE. AT THE POINT IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT WE ARE WITH WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS UP. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT -- WE'RE GONNA HOLD OPEN OF COURSE BUT WANTED TO GET THE INPUT FROM PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AS FAR AS WHAT'S NEEDED TO DO -- THESE EXPANSIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. OKAY AGAIN THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO AS FAR AS THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION IS IS INFORMATIONAL THIS POINTS AND WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. SO ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS THOUGH GOVERNOR'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME INVESTMENTS FOR FACILITIES WORK FORCE AND PLANNING SO SPRING UP AGAIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BELIAU AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION [inaudible] RIGHT GOOD MORNING AGAIN SERRA BURNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE REST OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. ON FEES FURTHER PROPOSALS. ROUND OUT THE OTHER. THE OTHER PART OF THE PACKAGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOR EARLY LEARNING IN CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INVESTMENT IN. QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN CHILDCARE INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN THE STRATEGIC PLAN WILL BUILD UPON ALL OF THE REST OF THE GREAT RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY OTHER ENTITIES. IN ADDITION TO FILLING IN SOME GAPS OF DATA AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS ABOUT THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME ACTION WILL STEPS FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO GUIDE. THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN THE FUTURE. THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FEES DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO HELP MOVE CHILD CARE AND EARLY LEARNING PROFESSIONALS ALONG THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. CONTINUE ON TO HELP TAKE CARE OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AS THEY'RE MOVING UP THE CAREER LADDER. AND LASTLY THE LAST TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE AWARDED COMPETITIVELY. TO OUGHT TO NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT ARE SERVING SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS -- AND WILL BE USED FOR AT NEW CONSTRUCTION OR RETROFITTING EXISTING BUILDINGS THANK YOU. A FAIR CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM THE SAME HAND OUT I WAS I SPOKE FROM EARLIER -- AND THIS TIME ALL START ON PAGE ELEVEN OF PROVIDING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE WORK FORCE FACILITY ISSUES IN PLANNING ON THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING. I'M SO CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL WORKERS MEETS OR AN EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THESE VERY BY THE PROVIDER AND THE POSITION THAT THE EMPLOYEE HOLDS -- UNTIL WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF INFORMATION ABOUT PROVIDER ABOUT FACILITIES -- CHILDCARE FACILITIES BUT FROM OUR CONVERSATION IN THE FIELD -- WE HAVE TO READ COMMENTS WITH WE WE THINK THERE'S THREE COMMON FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS THIS WOULD BE AT LEAST A SUBSIDIZED RATE WHERE THERE'S A PROVIDER -- WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC ENTITY AND GIVING OF THE PROVIDER -- GIVING THE PROVIDER SUBSIDIZE REACHES ONE DOLLAR FOR THE YEAR TO POP THE FACILITIES ON THAT LAND OF PROVIDERS ALSO LEASE AT MARKET RATES SO THEY'RE PAYING -- THEY'RE PAYING THIS MARKET RATES AND THEN THEY ALSO OWN COULD THERE EITHER PAYING A MORTGAGE OR THEY PAID OFF THEIR MORTGAGE. ON PAGE TWELVE A WE OUTLINE SEVERAL OF THE PLANNING EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED -- IN PRIOR YEARS AND ALSO SOME THAT IS FORTHCOMING ALL JUST HIGHLIGHT -- TO TWO OF THESE THE FIRST IS THE THE FIRST BULLET IS THE BLUE RIBBONS COMMISSION THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY EDUCATION EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THEY BEGIN MEETING IN MARCH TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND RECENTLY RELEASED A DRAFT SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPROVING THE SYSTEM. A LITTLE ALSO HIGHLIGHT ON THE THIRD BULLET WHICH IS THE PRE SCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT THE STATE WAS RECENTLY ORDERED FEDERAL FUNDS-- TO DO SOME PLANNING EFFORTS OF FOR CHILDREN BIRTH THROUGH AGE FIVE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOTABLE IN PLANNING EFFORTS THE HAVE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND A STRATEGIC PLAN -- PAGE THIRTEEN HIGHLIGHTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS SO WE'LL SKIP ON TO PAGE FOURTEEN FOR WE HAVE OUR ASSESSMENT ON THESE. PROPOSALS A ONE THING WE WE KNOW IT IS THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION AND SOME OF THESE AREAS -- AND THE STATE'S LACK OF DATA MAY RESULT IN THE STAVING UNABLE TO PRIORITIZE FUNDS AND USE THESE FUNDS IN A IN A TARGET WAY. I WANT EXAMPLES WITH THE WORK FORCE PROPOSAL -- THEY DO THEY DO INTEND TO INCREASE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF WORKERS BUT IT'S BUT ARE THE DATA DO WE DO HAVE IS HARD TO IDENTIFY THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WHERE. SOME OF THE WORKERS DON'T HAVE THE THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT THAT THIS THIS WHAT ON WHATEVER STATE WHATEVER GOAL THE STATE WOULD WANT TO SET. WITH REGARD TO FACILITY PROPOSALS WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS AND THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THAT PROVIDER SPACE. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S -- STRATEGIC PLAN THE TEN MILLION PROVIDED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES IS DUPLICATIVE OF RECENT EFFORTS -- AND FORTHCOMING EFFORT AND WOULD LIKELY BE REDUNDANT OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS CURRENTLY DONE. OR IN PROGRESS. MOVING ON THE PAGE FIFTEEN WE HIGHLIGHT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE STATE OF COULD SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING. SO CREATE A NEW A NEW ACCOUNT A CHILD CARE IMPROVEMENT A COW AND THE STATE IN THIS ACCOUNT COULD PUT MORE OR LESS FUNDING AND THEN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION -- AND WE DO SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF FUNDING THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR PLANNING THAT THE STATE OF SPECIFIED TO SPECIFIC STUDIES ONE IS ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS AND THE OTHER WOULD. WOULD BETTER UNDERSTAND A FAMILIES. WITH BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD CARE NEEDS OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES -- AND AND THEN ONCE THE STATE HAS BETTER INFORMATION WITH THE FORTHCOMING INFORMATION ON FROM THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THERE'S ALSO A A SURVEY COMING OUT FROM OF A SERVING WORKFORCE -- FIRST BECAUSE EDUCATE WORKFORCE -- EDUCATION -- WHAT'S WE HAVE ALL THOSE STUDIES AT THE STATE COULD -- DESIGN A VERY TARGETED AND A VERY TARGETED ONE TIME FUNDING PROGRAM. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING MA'AM MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. THE SUPERINTENDENT IS GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR IN ADDITION TO IS THE STORK INVESTMENT IN ACCESS IS ALSO PROPOSING SOME MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN OUR EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM. WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR INTENTIONALITY AS WE EXPAND ACCESS TO EARLY LEARNING CARE. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO SERVE OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. THE DEPARTMENT IS BIG ALREADY BEGUN MUCH OF THIS WORK USING FEDERAL PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT FUNDS AND IS DEDICATED STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES AS A PART OF THAT GRANT. THE GOVERNOR STAFF IS HEAVILY ENGAGED IN THIS PDG STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS AND THAT WORK IS ALSO BUILDING UP. UPON THE WORK OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS DRAFT REPORT AND OTHER RECENT REPORTS. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WILL TAKE TAKE. THE PROPOSAL WILL TAKE WHAT WE HAVE DONE THROUGH THE PDG STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS AND GO DEEPER INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS. WE ALSO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S WISDOM IN RECOGNIZING THAT TACKLING ISSUES AROUND FACILITIES AND THE WORK FORCE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORTING INCREASE ACCESS INTO ENSURING. THE QUALITY OF SERVICES ARE SUCH THAT CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE RICH LEARNING EXPERIENCES RESPONSIVE INTERACTIONS IN A SAFE AND ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT. AT THIS TIME I WILL NOW TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SERRA NEVER MORGAN AND SHE WILL GO DEEPER INTO FACILITIES AND WORKFORCE PROPOSALS. GOOD MORNING AGAIN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS MY MY COLLEAGUE MISTER JACKSON MENTIONED WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT GOVERNOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE. AND HIS DESIRE FOR INTENTIONALITY AS WE EXPAND THE SYSTEM. BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE WORK FORCE AND FACILITIES I WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. AND HIGHER HOW WE'RE TYING THAT INTO THE BLUE RIBBON BUT I'M IN A REALLY FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE WORK FORCE AND THE FACILITIES. AS I MENTIONED ON THE LAST PANEL TACKLING FACILITIES IN WORKFORCE ISSUES WILL BE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE AND PROMOTE THE CHILD OUTCOMES NEEDED. TO ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AS WE DIVE INTO THE WORK FORCE ISSUES WE KNOW THAT THE RESPONSIVENESS OF CHILD ADULT INTERACTIONS IN THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE ENVIRONMENTS ARE MAJOR PREDICTOR OF CHILD OUTCOMES. SO FOCUSING ON THOSE ADULTS THOSE EARLY EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF ANY SORT OF EXPANSION. WITH THAT WE WILL ALWAYS SAY THAT BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THEIR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND SO ON HIGHER ED. PORTIONS OF DEGREES THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT COMPENSATION AND ENSURING THAT THERE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED RESEARCH TELLS US THAT 58% OF CHILD CARE WORKER FAMILIES. PARTICIPATE IN ONE OR MORE PUBLIC INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAMS THESE TEACHERS MAKE A FRACTION OF WHAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS MAKE AND SAID THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AND SUPPORT TO GET THE COURSE WORK AND TRAINING NEEDED. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING QUALITY BY INCREASING THE KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES OF THE WORK FORCE. WERE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT IT% RECOGNIZES THAT THEY WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT. SO AS WE DIVE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS FROM A LOT OF THE QUALITY PROJECTS THAT WEHAVE FIND DEAD. THROUGH OUR CCD AFTER A CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT FIND QUALITY PROJECTS WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED AB TWO TWELVE OR THE CHILD CARE RETENTION PROGRAM AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOMETHING THAT FIRST CALIFORNIA'S FUNDED IN THE PAST FIRST FIVE CARES. THREE THOSE WORKFORCE EFFORTS AS WELL AS OUR QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA QC SEE QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM MARK WE'VE LEARNED LESSONS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND I WILL STRESS OVER AND OVER THAT BEING INTENTIONAL AND ENSURING THAT SUPPORTS FOR THE WORK FORCE -- ACTUALLY COR SO WE LEARNED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ADVISERS IN CARES WHAT WAS SUCCESSFUL PART FOR PARTICIPANTS WAS IT THAT DAY MATT WITH AN ADVISER TWICE A YEAR WHO HELPED THE MAP OUT AN INTENTIONAL PROFESSED ARE LEARNING JOURNEY. AND ADVISE THEM ON WHAT TRAININGS AND COURSE WORK TO TAKE THIS ALSO HELP THEM FILL EXTREMELY VALIDATED IN THEIR PROFESSION AND ACTUALLY IN THE RESEARCH THEY SHOW THAT THE ADVISER AND THAT VALIDATION WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER PART. OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTS. HAVING COURSE WORK THAT DEVELOPS KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES IS ALSO KEY SINCE SO MUCH OF PROGRAM QUALITY DEALS WITH IMPROVING ADULT CHILD INTERACTIONS. THAT COURSE WORK NEEDS TO REALLY INCLUDE A STRONG PRACTICE AND SKILL BASE COMPONENT THAT'S BEST PHONE TO PROMOTE TEACHER KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES. EMBEDDED VIDEO COMPONENTS WERE EDUCATORS CAN TAKE VIDEO OF THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR WITH THE CHILDREN AND THEN RECEIVE SPECIFIC FEEDBACK ON THEIR INTERACTIONS HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND ACTUALLY CHANGING PROVIDER PRACTICE. ENSURING LINKED COURSES UNTIL ONE OF THE TOP AREAS FOR EARLY EDUCATORS GETTING THEIR CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT GETTING AN A A OR A BA. IS THAT I'M GENERAL ADD REQUIREMENTS ARE MAINLY THE MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES WE HAVE FOUND THAT LINKING MATH OR ENGLISH COURSES TO CHILD DEVELOPMENT AS A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR HELPING THEM. THERE'S ALSO THE POWER OF COHORTS AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AS PART OF EFFORTS CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED COURTS IN THE PAST OF INDIVIDUALS. TO ACHIEVE DEGREES WE'VE EVEN HAD FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS GO THROUGH AND GET BACHELOR'S DEGREES WHEN THEY'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN A COHORT PROGRAM. THESE COVERT MODELS HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT INTEGRATE IN AND BAD HIGHER EDUCATION COURSE WORK WITH ON THE JOB TRAINING THAT EARLY EDUCATORS NEED TO DEVELOP THIS STRONG COMPETENCIES. AND THEN IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE -- COURSE WORKS ARE AVAILABLE TO A DIVERSE WORKFORCE CORE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPORTS ARE AVAILABLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. DURING NONTRADITIONAL TIMES AND ARE HOLDING COMMUNITY LOCATIONS ON INCLUDING THEIR WORK SITE OR IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL. REALLY FOCUSING ON SUPPORTS AROUND TO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS HOW TO HAVE INCLUDES A PRACTICE SAYS. ADDRESSING ANTI BY S. AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE REALLY LOOK AT WHO OUR CHILDREN ARE AND SUPPORT THAT WHOLE CHILD. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS EXPANSION WE REALLY NOTE THAT WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON THIRTY THOUSAND NEW CHILDREN IN STATE PRESCHOOL. AND FINDING OUT WORKFORCE AND ENSURING RETENTION THROUGH ADDRESSING A COMPENSATION REALLY IS KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT DATE ON THE WORK FORCE IS NOT AS DETAILED AS WE'D LIKE SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT WE WILL ALSO SAY THE NEEDS ARE SO URGENT AT THIS VERY MOMENT THAT WE WOULDN'T WAIT TO INVEST IN OUR WORKFORCE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. SPEAKING ABOUT DATA BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL PART AT THIS IN NOT TO DO ANYTHING YOU ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN SOME STATE LEVEL SYSTEMS. THE BUILDING OUT DATA SYSTEMS TO CAPTURE MORE OF THAT WORK FOR STATE AT ITS CORE. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE TO SHARE LESSONS LEARNED AND SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES. AND THEN WORKING WITH A THAT THE INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE BETTER ALIGNED PRE SERVICE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE CAñADA PROPERTY PREPARATION PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCES. AND FOCUS MORE ON THE COMPETENCIES AND THE SKILLS VERSUS THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE. CELL FROM NOT ONLY OF INTO THE FACILITIES PERSON WERE ALSO REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE WISE INVESTMENT ENSURING THAT FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE AS FACILITIES AND AVAILABILITY OF CARE OR INTER TWINED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SAID TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF OUR CAPACITY CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE MILLION CHILDREN AGES BIRTH. THREE TWELVE THAT IS THE RANGE THAT WE ADDRESS AND ARE SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM. OF THOSE CHILDREN WE ESTIMATE ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION ARE 68% LIVE IN FAMILIES WHERE THE PARENTS ACTUALLY NEED CARE. OF THE CHILDREN NEEDING CARE ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CARE THAT SUBSIDIZED BECAUSE THEIR INCOME IS THAT 85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME OR LOWER. SAID THAT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT WE ONLY HAVE ACCESS FOR UNDER A MILLION CHILDREN AT A TIME. SAID JUSTIN THE SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE WORLD WE HAVE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN ELIGIBLE AND YET WE ONLY HAVE CARE SITES. FOR NINE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE FACTORS IS FACILITIES. AS FACILITIES HAVE DROPPED OVER THE CAT PAST COUPLE YEARS AND AS WE'VE ADDRESSED ISSUES AND LACK OF ACCESS. AREAS SUCH AS FAMILY CHILDCARE GROWTH HAS -- RETRACTED AND DEALING AND SUPPORTING FACILITIES AND THE WORK FORCE CAN HELP US EXPAND THE ACCESS TO CARE THAT IS NEEDED FOR OUR FAMILIES. WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE FACILITIES EXPANSION WITH THE EXPANSION OF STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. SAID THAT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD IN WHO GETS THE PRESCHOOL THOUGHTS EXPANSION THEY ALSO ARE TYING IT TOGETHER WITH SOME FACILITY SUPPORT. KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE'S ALSO ONGOING INFANT TODDLER NEEDS AND I NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR SITES ARE FULL INCLUSION SPACES SAID THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING CHILDREN ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. AS WELL AS INCLUDING SITES ACROSS THE CITING TYPES OF MIXED DELIVERY AS WELL AS ALLEY AYE. I'M AS WE NAVIGATE THESE ISSUES THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER AROUND GIVE TO PUBLIC FUNDS. WELL WE'LL HAVE TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE USER MEETING -- KEEPING WITH PUBLIC TRUST AND THAT THE FUNDS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT SAID SIZE CHILDREN FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS AFTER I GET THEIR GRANT IS AWARDED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING HOW OTHER SIMILAR PROGRAMS DO THIS SUCH AS CHARTER SCHOOLS HEAD START AND OTHER STATES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE SYSTEM OUT AN INCREASE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY OUT THERE WE GOT. YES I READ ONE MORE HERE. I'LL START WITH THE WITH THE QUESTIONS AS FAR AS FACILITIES AYE AYE. FULL SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE. RESOURCES FOR FACILITIES FOR ABOUT THE LA A AND THE A AND THE NON ELLIE I JUST HAD ONE QUESTION IS A TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH OUR PROPOSAL. FOR FACILITIES. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S MORE COMMON TO GET TO GIVE FACILITIES MONIES TO TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO FORTH ALL. MOST LIKELY BE AROUND FOR THE LONG HAUL. SO. AND I KNOW WE HAVE THIS REVOLVING GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HAD SON -- HOOK ON THE OTHER LINE HE HAD TO PERFORM IS THERE ANY CONCERN AT ALL FOR FOR GIVING GRANTS -- TO NON ELLIE A ENTITIES FOR FACILITIES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL. BE AROUND DOWN THE ROAD AND WHAT TYPE OF INSURANCES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A WISE USE OF PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC BUDGET BUDGETING. ABSOLUTELY WE CERTAINLY WANT THE FACILITIES -- MONEY TO BE USED IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO HELP THE REGIONAL. AND THE REGIONAL PROVIDERS THE MOST THE ONES THAT NEED. THE MOST HELP AND THERE IS SOME MECHANISM WITHIN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR GIVING THE MONEY TO THE NON ELLIE GAYS WHICH IS THAT IT IS. BEING PROVIDED OVER FIVE YEARS WITH IN APPROXIMATELY EQUAL AMOUNTS AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THAT. IS TO PUT OUT SOME OF THE MONEY RIGHT NOW AND THEN BE ABLE TO REASSESS HOW IT'S BEING ABSORBED INTO THE SYSTEM AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. IF CERTAIN NON LEDS ARE ABLE TO TAKE IT MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS AND ADDRESS THOSE LOOK CAPACITY ISSUES OVER TIME YEAH. I GET THAT I KNOW IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTY MILLION A YEAR FOR EACH POT SO. LET'S SAY I'M A PROVIDER AND I DID AROUND LIKE ROBIN LANE FOR THIRTY YEARS DOING IN SAN DIEGO AND YOU GIVE THEM THE GRANT TO EXPAND YOUR RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT. THEY'RE GONNA DO YOU KNOW WHY SEE WHAT HAPPENS UP MY BRAND NEW PROVIDER WHO LIKE ALL OF US AND GET A STATE PRESCHOOL BRANDT GRANT. OR CONTRACT TO SERVE YOU KNOW YOUNG YOUNG YOUNGSTERS IN MY COMMUNITY AND THEN TWO YEARS LATER LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S NOT FOR ME. WE WE PUT THAT MONEY OUT AND AND SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ALSO WE HAVE ANY. YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF STRINGS ATTACHED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS IT A GOOD USE AND A RESPONSIBLE USE OF AB OF SCARCE PUBLIC DOLLARS. PLEASE RESERVE YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS SIMILAR TO THIS FROM OTHERS AND WE'RE LOOKING -- TO KIND OF EXPAND SOME OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SECTIONS IN THE COMING MAY REVISION. LA A A GROUP BROUGHT THE WITH THE LA -- ARE JUST THAT BECAUSE MISERABLE MORGAN -- MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK THERE ARE SOME -- OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SOME SIMILAR TO THAT YOU COULD USE OF POTENTIALLY MODELS A BIG PART OF IT DEPENDS ON THE FACILITY FUNDING IT'S FLEXIBLE SO SOMETHING LIKE A RENOVATION MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS BUT WE DO HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME OF BOND FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS THERE THAT -- I THINK IF THE THE CHARTER SCHOOL CLOTHES DOWN TO THAT FACILITY WITH THAT. WOULD BE LIKE A FIRST CALL FOR IT TO GO TO THE THE DISTRICT THAT THE AND THE NEIGHBOR TO THERE MIGHT BE SOME MECHANISM THAT THINK THEY'RE DEPENDING ON THE THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THESE FACILITY FUNDING OR USE WE MIGHT HAVE TO COME UP WITH. OTHER MODEL THIS ONE WORKS MORE IF THE FUNDING IS FOR A NEW SITE -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT YOU'LL WANT. TO THINK ABOUT AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO ENSURE THAT. IF A PROVIDERS NO LONGER GOING TO OPERATE THE YOU CAN. TAKE CONTROL TAKE CONTROL BACK OF THE FACILITY OR FIND WAYS TO GET FROM THE FUNDING. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A A GOOD NOTION I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SAME PIECE AS WELL WITH OUR PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG. THAT IF IT GOES BACK TO THE PUBLIC -- ENTITY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THAT THE THE WORK FORCE. I THINK AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THE MULLIN SAID THIS IS YOU KNOW GREATLY NEEDED. TO TO IMPROVE THAT THE QUALITIES THAT STANDARDS AND EDUCATION. LEVEL OF OUR WORK FORCE AND HOPEFULLY HAND IN HAND WITH THAT COMES YOU KNOW HIGHER COMPENSATION -- AND IS IT IS IT IS IT IS YOUR NOTION TO BE OPEN ENDED SO. SO THIS COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL GOING -- TO STRUCTURED PROGRAM AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR AT CSU OR THE COULD BE -- I GET YOU KNOW IT. ANON CREDENTIAL PROGRAM IN IN IN OTHER TYPE OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WHAT SPECIFICALLY -- DO YOU HAVE IN MIND HERE. THE WORKFRCE DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO HELP CHILD CARE AND EARLY LEARNING PROFESSIONALS MOVE ALONG THE EXISTING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM. SO THAT CAN INCLUDE THOSE TYPES OF CLASSES ON THE VARIOUS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD HELP THEM MOVE ALONG. THAT CONTINUUM SO IT'S OPEN ENDED SO THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO ENROLL IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR HIGHER INSTITUTION THERE CAN BE OTHER. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE. STATE WIDER -- REGIONALLY BASE THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS. CERTAINLY THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PROGRAMS BY FOCUSING ON THE WORK FORCE SO WHATEVER SORT OF TRAINING THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO HELP THEM MOVE ALONG THAT THAT WOULD QUALIFY. AND YOU'RE OPEN TO IT GOING TO THE INDIVIDUAL. AND FOR THE ENTITY THAT GETS THAT THAT [inaudible] STATE CONTRACTS. FOR THE PROVIDER HOW WOULD THAT WORK LOGISTICALLY. THE MONEY GOES OUT IN GRANTS TO LOCAL PARTNERS AND THEN THE LOCAL PARTNERS WILL DETERMINE WHICH PROVIDERS AND WITHIN THE PROVIDERS WHICH INDIVIDUALS WOULD RECEIVE. THAT FUNDING IN ORDER TO GET THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED. SO THE PROVIDER COULD GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY TO ENROLL IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. PROGRAM TO GET THERE. THE C. CREDENTIAL AND THEY PAY THEIR TUITION AB A STIPEND HOW THAT ACTUALLY HOW WOULD THAT WORK I KNOW WE HAVE THE OTHER PROGRAMS YOU MENTION THAT. CARES AND AB -- TWO TWELVE ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE SAME LINES AS WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE IN THE PAST OR WOULD IT BE MORE FLEXIBLE NOW. YES THERE HAVE BEEN. THERE HAVE BEEN A MULTITUDE OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WE IMAGINE IT WOULD GO OUT VERY SIMILARLY. AND THEN IF IF WE ARE TRYING TO RAMP UP I KNOW THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRES IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. I KNOW THIS IS. FOR FOR EARLY LEARNING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND PRE K. STATE PRE K. PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS BUT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON PRESCHOOL IF WE DO WANT TO WRAP UP AND SERVE ALL. AS YOU SAID EARLIER -- INCOME ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS -- DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS ENOUGH MONEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S REALLY FIFTY MILLION A YEAR OVER FIVE YEARS. OR SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT. PUSHING IT UP FOR THE NEXT. TWO YEARS IN OTHER WORDS IT IS -- AND IS THERE NOT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MAKE THOSE LOFTY GOALS A REALITY. THESE WORKFORCE DOLLARS ARE JUST ONE PIECE OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE YET TO BE ANSWERED ABOUT. HOW THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ALIGNS WITH THE OTHER EXPANSION PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE SO WILL WE WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THE FUTURE OKAY. QUESTION MISTER MARKETING NOW AND THEN I'LL LASTLY ON ON THE PLAN. THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN WE WE APPRECIATE THE LONG TERM PLANNING ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNIVERSAL -- ASPECT IN THE FINANCING PIECE THAT'S THERE YOU KNOW THE RENTAL WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE BALLOT MEASURES ON THIS. THE LAST -- TEN YEARS AND IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE JUST WANTED -- IT'S TO ASK -- HOW THIS COULD POTENTIALLY COORDINATE WITH THE WORK THE ASSEMBLY TO SPENT TWO YEARS WORKING ON OUR BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION? AND THEIR THEIR OTHER EFFORTS AS WELL SO -- I KNOW THE LAST -- PANELISTS MENTIONED HEY THAT'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE COULD USE RIGHT NOW FOR FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SO -- HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT YOU WANT THIS TO BE VALUABLE BUT ALSO -- RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF PLANNING HAS BEEN HAS BEEN DONE IN IN IN IN RECENT MEMORY AS PLEASANT AS RECENTLY AS RIGHT NOW WITH OUR ASSEMBLY PLANT. CERTAINLY WE ABSOLUTELY IN KNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES INCLUDING THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S FORTHCOMING A NEEDS ASSESSMENT A STRATEGIC PLAN FROM. THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT AND THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT IS THAT WE DEFINITELY KNOWLEDGE ALSO THAT THERE ARE GAPS OF THE DATA KNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED -- THE LA -- HAS ALSO A LOOK AT SOME OF THEM IN THEIR REPORT AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMPILE IN THIS REPORT ALL THESE OTHER DIFFERENT PIECES OF RESEARCH. AND IT GOES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THESE REPORTS AND WE WANT TO HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT WILL PROVIDE ACTIONABLE STEPS IN A IN A REAL PLAN TO ACT UPON. GOD THESE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND SORT OF LINK THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH. A STRATEGY -- IN SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER TO FUNDING IS A REALLY BIG -- AS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO LOOK AT AS WELL. WE WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN. IMAGINE A A FUNDING STREAM THAT WOULD REALLY WORK FOR ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE FUNDING STREAMS AND PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS SO THOSE ARE THE MANY DIFFERENT. THINGS THAT WE WANT THE STRATEGIC PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YOU'RE LOOKING. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OF OPEN AND APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR OTHER EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS AND WE DO HAVE SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING AND SHARING THEIR PROPOSAL SO. IF YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR FEAR STAFF IS WATCHING NOW IS THE TIME TO COME DOWN HERE. TO SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON YOUR PROPOSALS ON EARLY EDUCATION AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT FUNDING BILLS HERE WERE THAT'S FOR THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IDEA TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE STATE BUDGET -- NOW NOW IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO -- SO WITH THAT IS THE KIND OF THE CATCH ALL ISSUE -- ITEM SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LA JOH THIS ORDER. K. L. A. L. -- FIRST FIVE THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AND THE EARLY CHILDHOOD CAL COALITION AND THEN A PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE CORTES LA -- ALSO BE SPEAKING FROM THE HANDOUT THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED TO YOU RIGHT NOW -- I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS I'M SO STARTING OFF ON PAGE ONE I KNOW YOU DO IT A TIME OUT REAL QUICK WE DO HAVE A FEW OF OUR MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO JUST -- COMING SECOND YOU COME SIT OVER HERE. READING. AND THEN THIS RACE IS GONNA JUMP IN RIGHT HERE NOW YOU CAN. AND WE HAVE A A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE -- COMING IN RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL GET BACK TO THE PANEL. THANK YOU. WELL I AM SO SORRY I HAD TO INTERRUPT SERRA. I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE A CALL TONIGHT YES. SO PROUD OF HER SO SO PROUD OF DOCTOR SERRA. WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BUDGET REQUEST TODAY I'M PROUD TO ADVOCATE FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. TO BE UTILIZED FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SLOTS. WELL ESTABLISHED RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS EQUIP YOUNG CHILDREN WITH THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE READY TO ENTER KINDERGARTEN. AND HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE. FOR THE MORE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMMING PARTICULARLY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS PROVIDING NECESSARY SUPPORT FOR STATES WORKING FAMILIES. HOWEVER FOR WORKING FAMILIES CHILD CARE IS AN ACCESSIBLE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES CHILD CARE IS INACCESSIBLE DIFFICULT TO FIND OR SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE. CALIFORNIA FACES A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF CHILD CARE AND LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES ARE IMPACTED BY THIS SHORTAGE THE MOST. RECENT DATA INDICATES AT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE BUT DO NOT RECEIVE IT DUE TO THE LACK OF ACCESS IN OUR STATE. THAT MEANS EIGHT OUT OF NINE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE ARE NOT RECEIVING IT. WHILE I COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH PROVIDES PLENTY OF INVESTMENTS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS. CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXISTING PROPOSAL. LEAVING CHILD CARE OUT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INVESTMENTS AND EXPANSION WILL MEAN THAT THE LOWEST INCOME WORKING FAMILIES WILL STILL NOT TO BENEFIT IT'S STILL NOT BENEFIT. FROM EXISTING AND PROPOSED STATE INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA. THIS IS WHY I STRONGLY URGE STRONGLY URGE STRONGLY URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS REQUEST. OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO BE UTILIZED FOR GENERAL AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT CHILD CARE SLOTS. BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES DESERVE ACCESS TO THE GREATEST SOCIO ECONOMIC EQUALIZER. THAT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. AND HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE IS THAT EQUALIZER. I WANT TO THANK DONNA SNARE JUROR WHO IS HERE -- REPRESENTING THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AND MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. OKAY WE WE HEAR THE REQUEST LOUD AND CLEAR THANK YOU FOR í REQUEST THANK YOU YES THANK YOU WE HAVE THAT ON THE LIST OKAY WANT TO BRING UP ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. MISTER CARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SERVE WITH US CULTURE OF THE ASSEMBLY -- BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILD CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT WE SHARE OF A COMMITMENT TO MAKING THE BUDGET INVESTMENT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE COMMISSION'S BOLD VISION OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO QUALITY EAZY E.. I'M NOT TRYING TO INFLUENCE YOU IN ANYWAY -- I'D LIKE TO URGE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF A BY THE PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT MORE FAMILIES WITH INFANTS AND TODDLERS HAVE HIGH QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED CHILD CARE. AS A FORMER TEACHER I KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE CHILDREN ENTER KINDERGARTEN DURING THOSE EARLY YEARS. OF RAPID BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE. I TWO YEAR OLD FROM FAMILIES AND POVERTY ARE ALREADY SIX MONTHS BEHIND THEIR PEERS AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT HIGH QUALITY INFANT TODDLER. AND OUT CARE CAN CLOSE THE RATING IS GAP FOR THOSE CHILDREN BEFORE IT BECOMES AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- AS A SINGLE MOTHER I KNOW THE OF THAT AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORTING FAMILIES WE HAVE A CRISIS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE INFANT AND TODDLER CHILD CARE. MY ROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EXIST TO EXISTING CHILD CARE CENTERS AND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES TO REACH HIGHER STANDARDS. BASED ON PROVEN EARLY HEAD START MODEL. FIND THE WHAT SUPPORT FAMILIES -- FAMILY SUPPORT SKEWS ME FINDING WITH SUPPORT FAMILY SUPPORT WORKERS. TO HELP PARENTS HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT SCREENINGS BETTER TRAIN TEACHERS AND CONNECTIONS -- TO WELL CHILD HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE WHOLE CHILD THE WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH TO CHILD DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENT HAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON CHILDREN IN POVERTY. I ALSO PROPOSED EXPANDING QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED CHILD CARE TO TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL INFANTS AND TODDLERS LIVING IN HIGH NEED. COMMUNITIES I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AS WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SLOT FOR A CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITHOUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE FIRST PARTNER WHO INDICATED THEIR COMMITMENT -- TO THIS POPULATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION OUR PRIOR PANEL TALKED ABOUT THE NEED. NOT JUST FOR STATE PRESCHOOL IN THREE OR FOUR YEAR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD FOR INFANT AND TODDLER PROGRAMS AND FOR EXPANDED ROB AROUND WHICH YEAR ARE PROPOSING. ON TODAY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TOUGH TO THE CUSTOMER SELECT YES SO YOU MAKE YOUR BEST SHOT OVER THE PROBES COMMITTEE BUT HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR OVERALL BUDGET VISION SO RIGHT NOT THAT. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN WAS TO TALK TO US ABOUT. FACILITIES RESERVE YES HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY WOMEN RUBIO. RADIUS AND AGUILAR CURRY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS UP WE'RE PARTNERING ON THIS ISSUE I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED ON THE FACILITIES PIECE OF THIS -- MISTER CHAIR AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. DUE TO PERSISTENT UNDER FUNDING AS A STATE WE SERVE LESS THAN 3% OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN LICENSED CARE FACILITIES. I AM VERY ENCOURAGED AS ARE MY COLLEAGUES -- BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND AS PROPOSAL TO DEDICATE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION TO BUILD UP OUR CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. CITING RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SO BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION A REPORT BY THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT ON EARLY LEARNING FACILITIES. I AM SEEKING TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS TO THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE FACILITIES REVOLVING FUND WHILE THE REVOLVING FUND IS SEVERELY UTILIZE THE INTENT WILL BE TO LEGISLATIVE WE CONVERT THE REVOLVING FUND INTO A GRANT FUND. FOR CHILDCARE FACILITIES I HAVE -- ALSO RECEIVE SOME ENQUIRIES -- AS TO THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AMONG PROVIDERS AND SMALL AGENCIES AND APPLYING COORDINATED FUNDING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND THE CAPACITY. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO RENDER THAT ASSISTANCE I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WILL PROVIDE AMPLE TIME TO HAVE POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO QUICKLY AND EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS. SO WE CAN BUILD THE FACILITIES NEEDED TO CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS WHILE THEIR BRAINS ARE STILL AT THE PEAK OF DEVELOPMENT. AND MISTER CHAIR AS AS SOMEBODY WHO WHAT DID A PROJECT ON LOCAL INVESTMENT IN CHILD CARE WHICH WAS A FACILITIES PROJECT IN SAN MATEO COUNTY BACK IN THE NINETIES -- CLEARLY WE HAVE NOT SOLVED THIS PROBLEM AS WE SIT HERE -- IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT HOPEFULLY -- WITH THIS GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATIVE -- LEADERSHIP GROUP -- THAT IS PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE WECOULD FINALLY SEE THE BREAKTHROUGH THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN HOPING FOR SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEDERATION WESTERN CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU AND WE DID SPEND THE PRIOR -- OUR TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE. AND YEAR -- PROPOSAL -- CAME UP AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WILL BE CONSIDERING GREAT PICTURE [inaudible] APPLICATION [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT I THINK THERE MAY BE ONE MORE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON HER WAY BUT IN THE INTERIM WE CAN. CERTAINLY GO BACK TO YOUR PRESENTATION. GREAT THANK YOU MAY HAVE TO STOP YOU AGAIN BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT JUST LET ME KNOW -- SO RESUMING ON PAGE -- ONE THE STATE SHOWS THE THE CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIZE MANY CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS SO THE TOP ONE IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS CAL WORKS CHILD CARE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN -- SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE IN THESE TWO PROGRAMS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN THE MIDDLE TO PROGRAMS ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT A GENERAL CHILD CARE IN STATE PRISONS YOU. TOO I GOT BOMBARDED WITH PAPER JUST A MOMENT AGO SO WHAT WHAT'S THAT CAN HOLD UP WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SURE. SO THIS IS -- OVERVIEW LITTLE CHILD THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS -- SO WE'RE ON PAGE ONE AND IT'S A SQUARE WITH THE UP WITH FOUR PROGRAMS LISTED YES YES. OKAY SO SO THAT THE THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM PROGRAM ARE PROGRAMS WORSE AUTHOR AVAILABLE FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN -- INTO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT THE MIDDLE TO PROGRAMS WHICH IS ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM AND GENERAL CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL THESE ARE. THESE ARE REFERRED TO AS CAPP PROGRAMS WERE SLOTS ARE LIMITED BASED ON ANNUAL BUDGET APPROPRIATION. I'M SO SO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET. I'LL MOVE ON TO IS PAGE -- TWO THIS IS A CALIFORNIA SERVES AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN ALL THE CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE RUNS. AND THE SHOWS THE BREAKDOWN. OF CHILDREN SERVED. I'M MOVING ON TO PAGETHREE THE STATE PROVIDES FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION IN CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL FUNDS THROUGH A MIX OF FUN SOURCES AND THESE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN SIMPLY INTO STATE FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS. THE TO FUND SOURCES FOR STATE FUNDS WOULD BE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND THE OTHER SOURCES NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND THE FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCES ARE THROUGH CHILDHOOD CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND CANIFF TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES. MOVING ON TO PAGE FOR THE STATE FUNDS PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THESE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO VOUCHERS DIRECT CONTRACT AND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. A VOUCHER PROGRAMS IS WHERE THE STATE GIVES THE FAMILY A VOUCHER AND THE VOUCHER AND FAMILIES CAN SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO A VOUCHER BASED CENTER -- HE A CHILD CARE HOME OR FIFTH OR RECEIVE FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE IN THE STATE RELIES ON SOME REGIONAL AGENCIES TO ADMINISTER THAT WORK. DIRECT CONTRACTS IS WHERE THE STATE. CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE PROVIDER THAT WOULD BE A CENTER -- AND THEY ARE THEY HAVE THEY MAKE A CONTRACT AGREEMENT TO SERVICE SPECIFIC SET OF CHILDREN. AND THE FAMILIES WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO THOSE -- TO THOSE PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE THE CARE. I WILL NOTE THAT THE VOUCHERS RECEIVE THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND THE DIRECT CONTRACT RECEIVE THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH WILL GIVE MORE CONTACTS AS WE GO TO THE NEXT PAGE. SO PAGE FIVE SHOWS HOW READ COULD VERY BASED ON IF A PROVIDERS FUNDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE OR THE SCANNER REIMBURSEMENT WE AND WE ALSO PUT IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME. SOME CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM -- SO THESE VERY BY PROGRAM SETTING AND BY AGE SO THIS FIRST -- THE FIRST TWO LINES GOING DOWN ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES OF THESE ARE THE PROGRAMS AND JUST TO GIVE SOME COMPARISON -- THE INFANT THESE ARE THESE ARE THESE ARE THE AVERAGE FOR THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES OF THE THESE RATES ARE BASED ON ON THE COUNTY -- THAT THE PROVIDER IS SERVING SO WE'RE SO. THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES BASED ON A SURVEY THAT'S DONE EVERY OTHER YEAR WE'RE CURRENTLY USING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE THE RESULT IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WILL BE AVAILABLE ON FOURTH COMING. IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO -- THE SO THE SECOND GROUP. THE SECOND SHE WANT -- VEGAS THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH LINE ARE THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THIS IS SET -- THIS IS SET BY THE ANNUALLY BY THE STATE -- IN RECENT -- IN THE LAST BUDGET THERE WAS RECENTLY AN AUGMENTATION TO THIS BUT THIS IS A CONSISTENT RATE ACROSS ALL ACROSS ALL PROVIDERS AND IT'S VERY BASED ON SETTING -- AND AGE GROUP. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. I FORGOT HIS NECK SO JUST GO AHEAD OF ME YEAH. ERIN TOLD ME TO GO FIRST. GOOD MORNING DONNA SNARE INJURE IT WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE -- AS A REPRESENTATIVE THE OF THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION COALITION WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP OF THIRTY FIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ADVOCATES ADVOCACY AND SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WERE WORKING TOGETHER. TO SECURE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND CARE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND I THINK YOU'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT. WHEN WE HAVE OUR MEETINGS AND THERE'S QUITE A QUITE A GROUP? THAT WE PULL TOGETHER SO. I'M LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE BOLD INITIATIVES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES -- I'D ALSO SAY THAT THEY HAVE REFERENCE VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT EARLY LEARNING AND CARE IS A TWO GENERATION APPROACH PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WITH FAMILIES WHO ARE IN POVERTY. AND ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES CAN MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE FAMILY'S LIFE LONG TRAJECTORY AND THE SUCCESS OF THE CHILD IN SCHOOL. SO I'M WE REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT KIDS DO BETTER WHEN THEIR FAMILIES DO BETTER AND WE LIKE THAT APPROACH SO THAT FITS IN WITH A LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. I'M WE BELIEVE THIS BUDGET STARTS TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR AND MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE OUR SYSTEM CAN BRING STABILITY AND CONTINUITY TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES. WE CONSIDER THIS BUDGET TO BE A STARTING POINT AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN REASSURED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY SEE IT THAT WAY TOO SO WE SEE THIS IS A A PATH FORWARD. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE REALLY HAVE PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE CHURCH THE WHOLE SYSTEM WHOLE FAMILY WHOLE CHILD APPROACH LOOKING AT MULTIPLE FACETS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT. AS WE LOOK AT INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. FIRST AND FOREMOST AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOMEZ REYES ELOQUENTLY STATED -- WE'VE GOT A REAL GAP IN ACCESS AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT CHILD CARE BE AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE WHERE THE UNMET NEED IS THE GREATEST AND LARGELY IS STILL MISSING. WE NEED MORE CHILD CARE SPACES FOR THIS POPULATION TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN RECEIVE A SAFE AND NURTURING CARE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK I'M MANY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN THROWN ABOUT BUT THE ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MOST IS THE ELIGIBILITY HAVE FAMILIES THAT ONLY ONE IN NINE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES. AND WE REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR A PLANNING PROCESS TO START TO MAKE HEADWAY ON GETTING SERVICES FOR THOSE FAMILIES. I WE'RE ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM I THINK YOU HEARD MANY OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE COMPLEX AND VARIED A DEAL MADE A PAUSE [inaudible] NO. BY THE POINT BUT YOU GO HEAD OKAY. I'LL KEEP GOING I'M SO I WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THE PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT REFORMING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM WHICH I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE AARON GABLE. WERE ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF THE SHORTAGE OF FACILITIES AND WE KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO DELIVERING AN EXPANDING ACCESS TO EASY PROGRAMS WHICH YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT. WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT WORK FORCE AND PRIORITIZING CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS WHO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE CHILD'S LIFE. I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT LEARNING IN OUR EARLIER PANELS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. SAFE NURTURING AND CONSISTENT PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL AND CHILDREN LEARN THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS AND THROUGH ATTACHMENT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STRENGTHENED THE EARLY CHILDHOOD CONTINUE -- IN ALL CARE SETTINGS WHETHER THAT BE A FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER. A TITLE TWENTY TWO LICENSE CENTER OR TITLE FIVE CHILDREN ARE IN ALL OF THESE SETTINGS AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR LIFE AND DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS THAT WHOLE CONTINUE ON WHEN WE LOOK AT WORK FORCE SO THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS RECEIVING THE BEST QUALITY CARE WE CAN GIVE. I'M I HAD TWO THINGS I WANTED TO ADD BEFORE I CLOSE ONE WE REALLY ENCOURAGE -- THE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEDERAL CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING WHICH WAS EXPANDED LAST YEAR. THE A DECISION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS TO ALLOCATED AS ONE TIME FUNDING AND CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AN ADDITIONAL MONEY HAS BEEN ADDED TO THAT FUND. AND IT HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR TO US IN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FEDERAL ADVOCATES. THAT THIS IS ON GOING MONEY AND WE NEED TO ADD WE NEED TO ALLOCATE IT THAT WAY SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUR STAFF TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT THAT. AND THAT COULD BE MONEY THAT WOULD BE IMMEDIATE AVAIL IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN. AND LASTLY WITH RECENT REPORTS ISSUED BY THE BLUE RED AND RIPPING COMMISSION OUT EARLY EDUCATION. AND THE GOVERNOR MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY WE WE KNOW THIS IS TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK. AND WE STAND AS PARTNERS READY TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THE BEST WAY FORWARD TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN. OKAY THANK YOU BEFORE WE GET TO ERIN GAVE THE ONE THAT HAD ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. JOIN US TO PRESENT TO US ABOUT. THE BUDGET IN DC GREAT THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY TARDINESS -- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IN HIS JANUARYBUDGET PROPOSAL GOVERNMENT NEWSOME PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL ROLE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN TEACHERS HAVE IN CREATING A SAFE AND REACHING ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG CHILDREN. MY PROPOSAL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM AB TWO TWELVE AND THE CALIFORNIA EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE WORKING GROUP. MY PROPOSAL CALLS FOR IMPROVING AND EXPANDING OUR CHILD CARE% PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS BY FUNDING. QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE PROVIDERS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SUPPORT -- THE CUT CHILD CARE INITIATIVE PROGRAM WHICH HELPS CHILDCARE PROVIDERS GET LICENSED. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO HELP GROW OUR CHIP CHILD CARE WORKFORCE AND STIPENDS LIKE THE AB TWO ONE TWO TWO TWELVE WORK FAR SCRIPT WORKFORCE GRANTS. ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN SUPPORTING CHILD CARE PROFESSIONALS IT TO ENTER THE WORK FORCE AND ADVANCE IN THEIR CAREERS. QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS RELY ON SKILL SKILLED AND DEDICATED ADULTS THAT WORK WITH OUR YOUNG CHILDREN. I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE. I BELIEVE MY PROPOSAL WILL ENSURE THAT ALL CHILD CARE PROFESSIONALS HAVE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TRAINING. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ONGOING SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU AND WE SPENT THE LAST -- PANEL TALKING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND HOW IT RELATES TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTS ALL OF YOUR TESTIMONY SAY MEANS A LOT TO ALL OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AARON GABLE ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA I'M YOUR STATE COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD AND ALSO THE YOU SEE COALITION WE WOULD JUST WANT TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH ALL OF THE REMARKS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND FROM THE C. COALITION. SO I HAVE BEEN ASKED -- TO TO GIVE YOU A FIVE MINUTE OR LESS TALK ABOUT -- WHY CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT HEALTHCARE FUNDING SYSTEM IS A MESS? AND HOW IT SHOULD BE RENOVATED TO STABILIZE OUR CHILD CARE FIELD AND TO MAKE MORE SENSE IN GENERAL OKAY. SO I'M PART OF THE PAIN Là. FIVE MINUTES YES BY -- AT A TIME SO I'M PRETTY YOUR PAPER BUT APARTMENT IF YOU LOOK FOR THE THE THE COLOR GRAPHS -- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHILD CARE SINGLE RIGHT WORK GROUP WHO TOILED FOR OVER A YEAR. TO PRODUCE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ESPECIALLY OUR CO CHAIRS IN A BOOTH THE FROM EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA AND ON THIS YEAR AND FOR FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. AS WELL AS THE GOING PRICE GROUP WHO SUPPORTED ALL OF OUR EFFORTS -- I HAVE CIRCULATED TO YOU THE FRUIT OF THEIR WORK WHICH IS THE TWENTY TWO PAGE DOCUMENT IN THE BOMBARDMENT OF PAPER UP THERE -- WHICH GOES INTO VERY GREAT JOB ON THE PROBLEMS OF OUR CURRENT FUNDING SYSTEM THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS GREAT DETAIL ON OUR PROPOSAL. WHICH WE ARE CALLING THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A BIFURCATED REIMBURSEMENT RATE POLICY. ONE SYSTEM THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE IS BASED ON A SURVEY OF PRIVATE MARKET CHILD CARE COST IN EACH COUNTY. AND FUNDS ARE ABOUT YOUR BASED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS NAMELY ARE CAL WORKS TO JUST ONE THREE THREE AND OUR ALTERNATIVE -- PLACEMENT PROGRAM. THEN WE HAVE A SECOND SYSTEM WHICH IS THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT OF FUNDING PER CHILD SET IN STATUTE. THE FUNDS EVERY TITLE FIVE CHILD CARE CENTER THE SAME AMOUNT ACROSS THE STATE. BOTH FUNDING RATES FLOW TO THE LOCAL CHILD CARE AGENCIES BE A CONTRACT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF pAN APPLE TO APPLE COMPARISON TO MY FIVE MINUTE TIME LIMIT. I WILL FOCUS ON HOW THE CURRENT RATE SYSTEM IMPACTS THE HOW THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IMPACTS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND ITS FUNDING BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR PROPOSAL DOES SPAN THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE SYSTEM UNIFORMLY. THE FIRST GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. IS A VERY SIMPLISTIC REPRESENTATION OF HOW THESE TWO ON A LINE SYSTEMS OF RATES CURRENTLY WORKS. ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE A RANGE FOR THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE THE RMR WHICH IS UNIQUE TO EACH COUNTY BASED ON THE RATES PRIVATE PROVIDERS ARE CHARGING PARENTS IN THAT COUNTY. THE CURRENT REGIONAL MARKET RATE BASED ON A MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S WERE OPERATING ON AND WE'RE GONNA SEE PROVIDERS EARNING BETWEEN FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND ALMOST EIGHTY DOLLARS PER DAY. DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY AND ITS COSTS. ON THE RIGHT YOU HAVE THE AMOUNT PER CHILD THAT THE CHILD CARE CENTERS MEETING TITLE FIVE STANDARDS RECEIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL SYSTEM CALLED THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE OR THE S. R. R.. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF CONCERTED EFFORT BY THIS BODY AND THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE TO RAISE OUR FUNDING RATES THE PER CHILD S. R. OR RATE REGARDLESS OF COUNTY. REGARDLESS OF REQUIREMENT OR PROVIDER COST IS STILL ABOUT TWO DOLLARS LESS THAN THE LOWEST COUNTY REGIONAL MARKET RATE. CURRENT RATES ARE AN ADEQUATE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE PANELISTS TODAY AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO MEET THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY ACUTE AND ARE HIGH AND MODERATE COST COUNTIES. AND AND WE'RE HEARING MANY MANY STORIES IN SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES AGAIN DIEGO AND THE BAY AREA. IT IS KEY TO REMEMBER THAT THE LICENSED OR MORE FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET TITLE TWENTY TWO STANDARDS. THAT'S OUR OUR FUNDED PROGRAMS REQUIRED TO MEET ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE STANDARDS THE KYRIE INCREASED COSTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE REQUIREMENTS ARE LOWER ADULT TO CHILD RATIOS WHICH ARE KEY TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HEARD FROM SERRA NOVEL MORGAN REGARDING AT TRIAL TEACHER INTERACTIONS. INCREASE STAFF EDUCATION INCREASED TRAINING INCREASE FACILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CHILD ASSESSMENT REVIEW. ALL IMPORTANT RESEARCH TESTED ASPECTS TO A QUALITY LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. ANDADEQUATE FUNDING FOR TITLE FIVE STANDARD PROGRAMS OR EVEN MORE CUTE FOR SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FORCED TO USE THEIR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO MAKE UP A SHORTFALL FOR BASIC OPERATING COSTS. SHORTCOMINGS IN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE ALSO EXIST MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SYSTEM RELIES ON HISTORIC SNAPSHOT APPROACH WHICH IS ALMOST THREE YEARS OLD BEFORE NEW SNAPSHOT IS AVAILABLE. MAJOR COSTA BUSINESS CHANGES SUCH AS RECENT CHANGE THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE UNABLE TO BE CAPTURED IN SUCH A AN OLD -- SURVEY SYSTEM. THE SURVEYS ALSO ALLOW TO CAPTURE MARKET FAILURE. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN DEEP POVERTY COMMUNITIES CAN ONLY CHARGE WITH THEIR MARKET WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE ABLE TO PAY. THIS MARKET FAILURES AVERAGED INTO THE SURVEY'S RESULTS. SO CALIFORNIA NEEDS A SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES THAT ONE COMPENSATES ALL TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS FOR THE TRUE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. WHERE THE SQUEEZE THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER MY PREVIOUS PANELISTS? THE TO RECOGNIZE THE COST OF MEETING EXISTING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS INTENDED TO DRIVE CHILD OUTCOMES INTENDED TO PREVENT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THREE STABILIZE THE ABILITY OF THE STATE'S MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM TO PROVIDE QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPTIONS. THIS SINGLE REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SERVICES WOULD ONE ENSURE THAT POLICY MAKERS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND CARE FUNDING LEVELS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I'M NUMBER TO THE PARENT COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROGRAMS AND THEIR OPTIONS. AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY OPTIONS THAT THEY MAY WANT ACCESS. TO AND THREE THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED AS ONE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM SERVING VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS WHICH ARE KEY. BUT FUNDING THAT IS ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE THE SHARED SYSTEM MISSION OF SUPPORTING WORKING PARENTS AND THRIVING CHILDREN. THIS KEEP TWIN MISSION MUST BE PROTECTED THROUGH ALL OF OUR FUNDING POLICIES. SIGNIFICANTLY WE CAN LIKE WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA CREATE A FORMULA FOR CHILD CARE FUNDING BUT AS A DRIVER FOR THE CHILD AND SYSTEM OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT. THE SECOND GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A VERY SIMPLE DEPICTION OF OUR CONCEPTS. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL MARKET SURVEY. AND ALIGN THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE FUNDING SYSTEM TO A SINGLE TIERED REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE THAT USES THIS REVISED REGIONAL MARKET RATE AT THE BASE. TITLE TWENTY TWO STANDARDS WOULD EARN THE REVISED OR A MORE LEVEL IN THEIR COUNTY WE'RE CALLING THE BASE RATE. AND PROVIDERS MEETING ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE STANDARDS WOULD EARN THEIR COUNTIES BASE RATE PLUS AN ADDITIONAL QUALITY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR THEIR INCREASED REQUIREMENT COST. OUR GROUP CALCULATED THIS ADJUSTMENT FACTOR CONCEPT BASED ON THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS THAT ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN TITLE TWENTY TO ENTITLE. FIVE WE BELIEVE THIS CALCULATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IF WE EVER WANT TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR HIGHER STANDARDS FOR ALL PROGRAM SETTINGS. THE THIRD GRAPHIC YOU HAVE. THEN EXPLAINS THE IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN OF OUR PROPOSAL. OTHER THAN EXPECT THE STATE TO ABSORB THE COST OF THIS NEW RATE SYSTEM IN ONE YEAR WE ARE PROPOSING THAT LIKE WITH A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE STATE USE THIS NEW METHODOLOGY TO CREATE TARGETS EACH YEAR BY CONTRACT IN BY COUNTY. THEN EACH YEAR THE BUDGET ACT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS FOR RATE INCREASES AS THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION SOFFIT. AND THESE INCREASES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY TOWARDS EACH TARGET. RATHER THAN A FLAT INCREASE TO ALL AS WE CURRENTLY DO WITH COLA. THAT MEANS IMPLEMENTATION TOWARD THESE NEW RATE TARGETS ARE WITHIN THE CONTROL THE BUDGET PROCESS EACH YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THAT ALSO MEANS THAT IN A RATE INCREASE HERE COUNTIES WE GET AN INCREASE THE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR DISTANCE TO THEIR FUNDING TARGET. THUS HIGH COST COUNTIES WHO START MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR TARGET WE GET A LARGER SHARE IN A SINGLE YEAR RATE INCREASE THAN THEIR LOWER COST COUNTERPARTS. BUT ALL BOATS WOULD CONTINUE TO RISE TOGETHER. SO THE FINAL DOCKING YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A POLICY ONE PAGER WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN STATUTE. THESE CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE DESIGN THE CREATION OF NEW TARGETS FOR THE ENTIRE SINGLE FUNDING SYSTEM WOULD REPRESENT TOGETHER THE CHILD CARE STABILISATION FORMULA. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH THE MORE IT'S AS A PARENT I KNOW YOU HAVE A GREAT NAME SO. IMAGINE MY NAME'S JACQUELINE GETS HOME OKAY WELCOME GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS SO BEAR WITH ME IS MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS AND I THINK YOU OFFER GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY STORY WITH YOU -- I'M JACQUELINE THE TONE I'M A MEMBER OF PARENT VOICES CONTRA COSTA. MY TWO YEAR SOME MATTHEW HAS BEEN ON A WAIT LIST FOR YEAR. I HAVE A TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALSO BEEN ON THE WAIT LIST AND I NEVER RECEIVED THAT CALL. I'M HERE TO SPEAK FOR FAMILIES ON THE WAITING LIST TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO WAIT. WAITING FOR CHILDCARE MEAN CHILDHOOD DREAM SHATTERED. I ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN MY OWN SH SALON MY DREAM CAME TRUE LAST YEAR AND I HELD ON FOR IF TO IT FOR NINE MONTHS. UNTIL I HAD TO CLOSE IT BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE. IT MEANS HAVING TO QUIT A SECOND JOB THE SEC THE CONSTANT FEAR THAT MY THIRD JOB IN THREE YEARS. ONE I'M REALLY GOOD AT AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BUILD A CAREER MAY SLIP FROM ME BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE. BEING ON A WAIT LIST MEANS MEANS SPENDING THREE TO FOUR HOURS PER DAY COMMUTING BETWEEN MY HOME IN ANTIOCH. TWO IN AFFORDABLE AND FLEXIBLE FACT EXCUSE ME FLEXIBLE CHILDCARE PROVIDER TWENTY MINUTES AWAY AND THEN TO WORK IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. IT MEANS NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A RELIABLE CAR IN DEPENDING ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND OVERSEE GET ME BETWEEN THREE PLACES. THERE'S ALSO LOTS OF TIME TO SPEND WITH MY CHILDREN WHO ARE MISSING OUT ON MY PRESENCE. IT MEANS HAVING TO MISS OUT ON MY KIDS SCHOOL AND SPORTS ACTIVITIES AND TELLING MY DAUGHTER I HAVE TO MISS ANOTHER. BRING YOUR LOVE ONE TO LUNCH DAY BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ATTEND IT ON MY LUNCH BREAK. IT MEANS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK BUT ALSO PUSHING OUT SOME BILLS AND CONSTANTLY WORRYING. BEING ON A WAIT LIST HAS MADE ME FEEL HOPELESS FRUSTRATED AND STRESSED IT MEANS LOSING SLEEP BECAUSE I'M IN A CONSTANT PANIC. NOT KNOWING IS THE HARDEST PILL TO SWALLOW TOO MANY OF US FAMILIES THE WAITING LIST IS REALLY THE NO HOPELESS I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND HEARD YOU ALL DISCUSSING IT. IT LEAVES ME HEARTBROKEN THAT THERE'S NO CHILD HERE BEFORE YOUR KID IS FOUR YEARS OLD. OF THE CHILDREN ON THE WAIT LIST COLOR MATTHEW IS ONE OF THEM. THE ODDS ARE STACKING UP AGAINST HIM AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN BOY. BUT I AM HERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM TO GET LOST IN THE DATA AND THE STATISTICS. HAVING CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE IMPACTS BOTH THE CHILD AND THE PARENT FOR MY SON IT WOULD HELP HIM TO HAVE ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ONCE HE STARTS SCHOOL. AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ENHANCES HIS SKILLS AS A PARENT I WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY KIDS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORK SUCH LONG HOURS TO COMPENSATE FOR CHILDCARE. IT WOULD HELP ME CATCH UP ON MY BILLS AND HELP ME ADVOCATE ADVANCE AT MY MY JOB FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS. MY EMPLOYER SEES HOW HARD I WORK I AM PROVING TO BE ONE SOMEONE THAT WANT THEY WANT TO SUPPORT IT'S AFFORDABLE. CHILDCARE THAT WILL EITHER MAKE OR BREAK ME. TO WAIT FOR CHILD CARE IS AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER FOR THE PARENT AND THE CHILD. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR WORKING PARENTS THAT NEED THE ASSISTANCE IF THINGS GET SO BAD DO I REALLY NEED TO LOSE ANOTHER JOB OPPORTUNITY. FOR MATTHEW AND ALL HIS PEERS WE ASK THAT YOU INVEST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN. CHILD HERE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS SO THAT THIS HIS CHILDHOOD YOU HIS CHILDHOOD DREAMS CAN BE EVEN BIGGER THAN MINE. OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL NOT THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED BUT I HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN THIS. TOPIC FOR FOR A WHILE WE CAN BE ON IN HEARING WHAT WENT OVER ABILITIES BUT I DO ACTUALLY MAYBE A LOS ONE QUESTION. FOR FAIR AND GABLE ON ON THE PROPOSAL FOR THAT. REASON BASED REIMBURSEMENT -- REFORM -- STREAMLINING AND INCREASING THE THERE WERE THE RATE STRUCTURE. WHAT'S THE AND I KNOW ALL DEPENDS ON HOW FAST YOU DO IT. WHAT'S THE ROUGH -- DOLLAR AMOUNTS OVER THE OUT YEARS AND AND HOW MUCH -- WOULD BE NEEDED -- IF YOU DID LET'S SAY A FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION. ON THIS SO OUR OUR COST ESTIMATES -- WOULD OF COURSE WHICH WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED WHEN WE SEE THE NEW ARE AMMAR SURVEY LATER THIS SPRING BUT ARE ARE AT COST ESTIMATES THIS POINTER BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND TWO S. SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE TOTAL PACKAGE FOR THE EXISTING SYSTEMS OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED IF YOU ADDED INCREASED SERVICES THIS YEAR AS WE ARE ALL HOPING TO SEE HAPPEN AS WELL -- OUR HOPE IS THE NAY ADDITION TO THE CALL OF THIS YEAR THAT THERE CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS THIS NEW RATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM. SO IDEALLY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER A FIVE YEAR. PERIOD WE CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. AND IS THAT AMOUNT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE RATE INCREASES OVER THE PRIOR YEARS THAT IS THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT. I WE WERE ACTUALLY VERY HEARTENED TO SEE THAT WITH THE INFANT TODDLER ADJUSTMENT FACTOR CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LAST YEAR ALMOST ALL OF OUR PROPOSALS. IN THE INFANT TODDLER RATE SPACE HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VERY HIGH COST COUNTIES SO MOST OF THE COST YOU SEE HERE IN THIS PROPOSALS ACTUALLY FOR A RIGHT SIZING THE PRESCHOOL REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND THEN JUST TO CLARIFY YOU SAID THIS EARLIER BUT THIS WOULD BE FOR ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA FUNDING YOU SEE PROGRAMS CORRECTIVE FROM INFANT TODDLER PROGRAMS GENERAL CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL CORRECT CORRECT AND FOR ABOUT YOUR BASED PROGRAMS THERE IS THAT BENEFIT ACROSS THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. ARE RIGHT SIZING -- SOME SOME. SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITHIN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AS WELL. AND AND NOT TO SAY YOUR YOUR YOUR FORMULA. AND THE CHARTS HERE ARE NOT ENOUGH IN PLAIN ENGLISH. LAURIE YOUR TWENTY THREE PAGE -- SUMMARY. BUT YOU KNOW WE SPENT THE EARLIER PART OF TODAY TALKING ABOUT ACCESS. AND THE THE TOUGH TIMES THAT THE ELEAZAR ARE HAVING PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS AND THE FACT THAT -- YES REALLY WERE SQUEEZING OUT FAMILIES. THANK YOU JUST TESTIFIED TO THANK YOU. AND THE FACT THAT OUR WORK FORCE IS AN ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED AND CAN MAKE MORE WORKING AT IN AND OUT BURGER AND COSCO. SO IT IN IN IN PLAIN ENGLISH HOW WITH THIS. ALL OF THIS IMPACT THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FROM. NINE TO TEN THIRTY ABSOLUTELY. ADEQUATE PER CHILD FUNDING THAT MEETS THE COST WE EXPECT FOR BOTH CHILD OUTCOMES THAT PREVENT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BUT ALSO TO BE DURING THE HOURS FOR PARENTS NEED TO WORK. IS ABSOLUTELY KEY IF WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE PER CHILD FUNDING RATES WE DO NOT HAVE PROVIDERS WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE FOR CHILDREN AND TO MOVE THE DIAL FOR THEM IN A CHIU GENERATIONAL APPROACH IT'S IT'S A VERY FUNDAMENTAL. ISSUE AND SO WE SEE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM US FOR MANY YEARS -- WE SEE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AS KEY TO ACCESS EXPANSION NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF ACCESS EXPANSION. AND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S AT THIS INCREDIBLE HISTORIC CHAPTER OF CONTEMPLATING NOT WHETHER TO GET TO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL BUT HOW TO GET TO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IT'S REALLY KEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ARCHITECTURE. THAT THE FUNDING DRIVERS ARE MAKING SURE WE GET THERE IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO IMPROVE CHILD OUTCOMES YEAH SO THIS IN THIS IMPACTS. ACCESS -- THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS MAKING SURE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKFORCE ABSOLUTELY YES AS I CAN -- TRY FACTOR RIGHT THERE ABSOLUTELY YES SO SIGN ME UP. WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I'M A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BILLS NOT. THANK YOU FOR STAYING ON MESSAGE. THAT'S WHERE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE OF COURSE SO THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND WE WE LOST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PEOPLE THERE OVER THERE SO I I'M SURE WE'VE I'M SURE YOU AND YOUR ADVOCATES HAVE TALKED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THIS YEAH ABOUT THIS -- PROPOSAL AND ANY ANY -- FEEDBACK OR ANYTHING YOU SHARE WITH US NO NO I I THINK WE WOULD JUST WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- FOR YOU JUST PROVIDING SOME BASIC FEEDBACK DURING OUR PROCESS AND DELIBERATIONS AS A WORKGROUP THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THE LA -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL I LISTENED AND AND CONTRIBUTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO OUR DELIBERATIONS IN OUR THINKING AND WE REALLY. APPRECIATED IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE BACKGROUNDS THE SYSTEMS BETTER THAN ANYBODY. AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THIS BUT YOU KNOW I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND AND WE'VE BEEN ON THIS QUEST FOR A FEW YEARS AND PEOPLE BEFORE ME HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS BUT WE COME THE REALIZATION THAT. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE OTHER IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK IT'S NOT JUST LOTS IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE SELL THESE AND AND RATES IN THE WORK FORCE SO I THINK. THIS -- TIES OUT ALL TOGETHER IN A PACKAGE OF SO IF YOU WANT TO DO FOR EXAMPLE STATE PRESCHOOL EXPANSION AT TEN THOUSAND SLOTS PER YEAR. ABSENT THIS AND THE FACILITIES IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT -- TO TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS AND SO I THANK YOU FOR HELPING PUT THIS TOGETHER AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW TOO THAT -- THAT THAT DOESN'T MINIMIZE THE DESIRE THAT THAT YOU OUTLINED AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GRAY S. AS FAR AS AND RUBIO THE NEED FOR PROGRAMS. FOR FOR YOUNGSTERS BEFORE THE AGE OF THREE AND FOUR SO THANK YOU AS WELL [inaudible] OKAY. I WITH THAT WE'RE GOING -- TO BRIEFLY GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE LATE. TO COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WE WE WE HAD DISCUSSED THIS IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSAL. A PAST FEARS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE BEST PLACE TO PUT IT WE LOVE THE IDEA. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT ALL WORK AND SO WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER HOW THE AT THE OUTSET THAT AS YOU KNOW. WE DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS LAST TWO YEARS IN THE BUDGET SO IS WHEN TO MAKE SURE WE WE FOCUS ON WHAT -- IS THAT IT IS WORKING AND SO ENOUGH ALLOWED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO BRIEFLY OUTLINE -- THEIR PROPOSAL AND THEN HAVE THE LA GO AND SEE IT COMMISSION -- ADDRESSES AS WELL THANK YOU HELLO AGAIN LEASE EMERGENCY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO AS YOU MENTIONED THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT. PILOT PROJECTS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHILANTHROPIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR INCOMING KINDERGARTNERS. THESE ACCOUNTS ARE GENERALLY OPEN WITH INITIAL CONTRIBUTION -- SEED MONEY FROM SPONSORING ORGANIZATION SUCH AS GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS PHILANTHROPIC PHILANTHROPIC FOUNDATIONS AND BUILD ASSETS OVER TIME THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FAMILY FRIENDS THE CHILD. AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES -- COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ARE DESIGNATED FOR AN% INDIVIDUAL CHILD AND CAN BE USED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE RELATED EXPENSES SUCH AS TUITION ROOM AND BOARD. BOOKS -- SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT AND OTHER RELATED FEES. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO SUPPORT ENCOURAGE OF FAMILIES TO BUILD ASSETS FOR THEIR CHILDREN POSTED AS SECONDARY EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY THE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S TO GENERATION EFFORT. TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN THE STATE BY A NUMBER ONE PROMOTING FINANCIAL LITERACY TO CULTIVATING A COLLEGE GOING IDENTITY AMONG BOTH STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. AND THREE LEVERAGING RESOURCES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO ASSIST IN MAKING POST SECONDARY EDUCATION ATTAINABLE WITHOUT I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND WALK MANY QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU LA A BE THINKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ALL THIS IS ASPEN FINASTERIDE OVERVIEW OF COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OF CONTEXT FOR THIS CONVERSATIONS PLACE THE SERGEANTS HAS HAVE JUST DISTRIBUTED GET ANOTHER HAND OUT TO YOU THAT WE WILL BE SPEAKING FROM. YOU'LL SEE THE TOP OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT THAT FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS FOR A SPECIFIC TYPE OF COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT CALLED THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. PARENTS CAN OPEN UP ONE OF THESE ACCOUNTS ON BEHALF OF A STUDENT. AND THE FUNDS THAT INVEST IN THIS ACCOUNT WILL TEND TO GROW OVER TIME. THE MAJOR TAX ADVANTAGE OF FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN IS THAT THE EARNINGS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT TAXABLE AS LONG AS THE STUDENT USES THE FUNDS. A QUALIFIED EDUCATION EXPENSES AS THE PART OF FINANCE HAS DISCUSSED. NEARLY EVERY STATE ADMINISTERS THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. AND AS YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN IS CALLED SCHOLAR SHARE. ADMINISTERED FROM WITHIN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND OPEN ACCOUNTS. PERIODICALLY SCHOLAR SHARE OFFERS MATCHING CAMPAIGNS TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION COURAGE FAMILIES OPEN ACCOUNTS. CURRENTLY THROUGH THE END OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN CALENDAR YEAR. LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT. QUALIFY FOR UP TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN MATCHING GRANTS. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE ALSO BEEN A NUMBER OF LOCAL EFFORT SOME OF WHICH YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION COLLEGE SAVINGS. THE FIRST AND LARGEST OF THESE PROGRAMS WAS LAUNCHED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN. TWENTY ELEVEN CURRENTLY SAN FRANCISCO OPENS A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT AUTOMATICALLY FOR EVERY KINDERGARTEN AND THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. MAKES AN INITIAL DEPOSIT OF FIFTY DOLLARS. IT ALSO OFFERS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE. SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THIS PROGRAM SEVERAL OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES HAVE LAUNCHED COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS DO VARY WIDELY IN TERMS OF HIS ELIGIBLE FOR THEM. BUT THE PROCESS IS TO ENROLL WHETHER THAT'S AUTOMATIC ARE OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE. AND ALSO WHAT INCENTIVES IN PLACE FOR FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE FUNDS. YOU'LL RECALL THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEGISLATURE CREATED A PROGRAM CALLED EVERY KICK COUNTS TO SUPPORT THESE LOCAL EFFORTS. IN PREFABRICATED SO PROVIDES GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ARE WORKING TO INCENTIVIZE FAMILIES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. TO CONTRIBUTE TO COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. THIS DID NEED COMMISSION ADMINISTERS THIS PROGRAM AND RECOGNIZING THAT THEY'LL BE PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON IT I'LL KEEP OUR COMMENTS IN THIS BRIEF AND CONCLUDE OUR OVERVIEW. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. STATE COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING DAVID O'BRIEN OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- HAPPY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM SAYS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. NOTED IN TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE BUDGET ACT PROVIDED A LITTLE UNDER THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THIS TO NAY COMMISSION. TO PROVIDE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ELIGIBLE ENTITIES THAT OPERATE COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAMS THE FUNDS CAN BE USED -- FOR A FEW DIFFERENT SPECIFIC PURPOSES AMONG THEM TOPPING UP THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES -- FOR FAMILIES -- PROVIDING -- OUT REACH FUNDS TO MAKE FAMILIES AWARE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY -- AS WELL AS SOME INDEPENDENT EVALUATION TO DO SORT OF BEST PRACTICES AND SOME SHARING OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES -- AMONG THE ENTITIES SO WE USED TO COMMIT A PROCESS KNOWN AS HER PRESS FOR APPLICATIONS FOR THIS PROGRAM WHEREBY WE PUT OUT A STATE WIDE REQUEST TO ANY ELIGIBLE ENTITY THERE IS AN APPLICATION PERIOD. A TOTAL OF NINE ENTITIES APPLIED AND ALL WERE ELIGIBLEFOR LISTED ON IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE. TWENTY AND WE WERE NOT -- UNFORTUNATELY ABLE TO AWARD EVERY ENTITY THE FULL AMOUNT THE REQUESTED BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE SCALED DOWN TO MEET THE THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND THE FORMULA THAT WAS IN THE STATUTE FOR US TO SORT OF DETERMINE HOW MUCH EACH ENTITY WAS GOING TO RECEIVE BUT LAST WEEK ARE COMMISSION DID VOTE TO APPROVE THESE RECOMMENDED DISTRIBUTIONS. SO WE HAVE HERE IN YOUR GENDER ARE THE FINAL AMOUNTS THAT WE DISTRIBUTED -- GOING FORWARD AS A REALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE'RE OF COURSE AWARE THEIR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATION WHICH PER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER WILL DISCUSS -- THAT -- MAY PLACE SUCH A PROGRAM ON AN ONGOING BASIS EITHER AT ANOTHER AGENCY THIS TO MAKE COMMISSION AND WE WERE BROUGHT UP AS A POSSIBILITY. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS IN TERMS OF A RECOMMENDATION FOR HAPPY TO CONTINUE BEING PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND WE CERTAINLY FEEL THAT -- ENCOURAGING COLLEGE SAVINGS IS BOTH. OF OUR MISSION AND WORTH DISCUSSING AS WE DISCUSSED Là EFFORTS TO OVERHAUL AS THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SINCE -- AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL THOSE CONCEPTS UNDER DISCUSSION -- INVOLVE -- SOME EXPECTATIONS ON PARENTS AND STUDENTS TO BRING SOME FUNDS UP FRONT SO WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT COLLEGE SAVINGS FITS INTO THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT FINANCIALLY REFORM AS WELL. AND HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OUT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT -- THIS IS THAT A PRIORITY FOR THE ASSEMBLY AT WE WE FULLY SUPPORT THESE COLLEGE SAVINGS -- ACCOUNTS AND THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD BE STEPPING UP AND DOING THIS I THINK THE RESEARCH IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. WE KNOW THAT COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO TO CALLS FOR OUR ECONOMY DID TO SUCCEED WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE ON THE TICKET TO THAT. MIDDLE CLASS TODAY IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH SHOWS IF YOU HAVE A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH. YOU KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU STILL ABOUT SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE YOU SEE THE EXPECTATIONS BUILT UPON HAVING YOUR NAME. WAS SOME MONEY. IN THE ACCOUNT WITH YOUR NAME TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE IN THE FUTURE SO. I'M A BIG SUPPORTER THIS AND I I TOLD THE COMMITTEES BEFORE BUT I SAW THAT'S HOW SAN FRANCISCO CREATE THEIR PROGRAM OVER A DECADE AGO. WHEN OUR THEN -- GOVERNOR WAS MARE AND I WAS SO INSPIRED THAT I LAUNCHED OUR OUR OUR OWN PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO THE SACRAMENTO. A KINDERGARTEN COLLEGE PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE HELPING COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE STEP UP AND DO THIS SO I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL -- JUST JUST ONE COPY OUT IS THAT WE'VE KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS I THINK IT JUST WORK REALLY WELL WITH THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT MODEL AS OPPOSED -- TO REINVENTING THE WHEEL BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF YOU KNOW BRAIN DAMAGE THE LAST TWO YEARS TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT SO LET'S AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT HOW HOW HOW WE ON A CRAFTED THAT -- THAT PLAN GOING FORWARD BUT WITH THAT. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET. SO THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AS WELL NO ACTION TODAY. AND WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE OVERALL ISSUE OF TODAY IS -- EARLY EDUCATION AND THIS OF COURSE ANYBODY WANTS TO TESTIFY ON THIS TOPIC AS WELL WE'RE GONNA HIT HAVE -- PUBLIC COMMENTS BEGIN NOW AND WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE START LINING UP.

AND LAWS FROM APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION OF THE WORK FORCE FINALLY EARLY AGE BELIEVES THAT AS THE STATE MAKES THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE OUR SIGHTS ON IMPROVING QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.

THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHRIS FOR AMERICA -- HEAD START CALIFORNIA -- I THINK THE WAY THAT WE SPEND OUR MONEY IS REFLECTS OUR OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO JUST TWO OF THE PRINCIPLES FROM THE RECENT BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION DROPPED REPORT. AND THE FIRST IS EQUITY AND THE NEED TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT SEPARATE FAMILIES FROM OPPORTUNITY INCLUDING POVERTY HOMELESSNESS. AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE MISSION OF HEAD START. PROVIDING A WHOLE CHILD TO GENERATIONAL APPROACH TO SUPPORTING THE CHILDREN WHO ARE MOST AT RISK IN CALIFORNIA. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE IS PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR EFFECTIVE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDING MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL INVESTMENTS LIKE CCD BG. AND HEAD START -- SO WE ARE URGING THE STATE TO DO IT TWELVE OTHER STATES ARE ALREADY DOING. TO INVEST IN HEAD START BECAUSE IT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM WE'VE SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE ARE BUDGET REQUEST FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. FACILITY DEVELOPMENT FOR INSTANCE IN TODDLERS AND OUR RICH FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES AND FINALLY IN THE SPIRIT OF ERIN GABLES COMMENT OF RAISING ALL THE BOATS ON THE WATER. AS THESE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS MOVE FORWARD STRONGLY RECOMMEND MAKING EARLY CHILDHOOD INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY IN THE WORK FORCE AND FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO ALL ENTITIES. PROVIDING GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED CARE THANKS. WHEN MISTER CHAIRMAN TEMPLE TERRACE CHILD THREE SIXTEEN LOS ANGLES?

USER MISSING AND SO ON TO GET THIS SORT OF OCCASION TO GET THEIR DEGREES AND TO BE RAISING THE QUALITY MERELY SO. PLEASE ADD THAT AS WELL.

HI DENNIE MICHELETTI COLBERT REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION -- ALSO SUPPORTING ALL THE COMB COMMENTS OF THE SEA COALITION AS A MEMBER I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ON THE TECHNOLOGY OF FUNDING THAT'S IN THE AGENDA. THIS IS DESPERATELY NEEDED BY -- FIGHTERS AND CENTERS AND CONTRACTORS TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES -- IT STARTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WAS A MOVE TO MOVE TO DIGITAL SIGNATURES AND ELECTRONIC CHECK IN IF KIDS IN CENTERS AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE MOVING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY -- MANY OF THE COMMUNITY CONTRACTORS WANT TO BEGIN ADDRESSING MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE IN YOUR THAT BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ONE OF THOSE WE HAVE THE CENTRALIZED WAITING LIST WHICH IS GREAT. BUT AWAITING THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY DOING THE ELIGIBILITY DATA AND SUPPORTING THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ABLE TO DO REAL TIME ELIGIBILITY -- OF THE FAMILIES AS THEY PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST WE ASK YOU TO REALLY SUPPORT THAT -- IN REGARDS TO THE WORK FORCE WE'D -- ALSO ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER LOOKING AT THE PROVIDERS OF SUBSIDIZE FAMILIES THE SAME WAY AND VALUE THEM IN SOME OF THE SAME WAY AS WE DO OUR PRIVATE PAY. FOR INSTANCE A SUBSIDIZED CENTER PROVIDER OR FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME WHO HAS A SPACE FOR A SUBSIDIZED FAMILY IF THE FAMILY DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER DURING THE MONTH.
