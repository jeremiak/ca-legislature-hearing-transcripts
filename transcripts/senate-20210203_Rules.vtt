00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:39.016
GUILDS DAD. SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:42.486

THINK THE PROBLEM IS MUCH

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.236
BIGGER THAN JUST THESE COUPLE

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:00.704

00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:01.938
GET ON BOARD COMMUNITY AND HAVE

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.674
SOME EDUCATION PROGRAM AND THE

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.008

THEY NEED TO HAVE A MORE

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.191
AGGRESSIVE TRAINING. AND THEY

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.460

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.076
GREAT CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:42.312
WITH RESPECT THE DEPARTMENT

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.546

OF YOUR EXPERTS IN YOUR FIELD.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.570

NOW SO. THE MEDICAL BOARD. THEN

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:45.360
THERE IS A IN DEPTH NEED TO

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:47.829
INCREASE. BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.464
TO BE SOME OTHER THINGS DONE

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.232
WITHIN THE STRUCTURE

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:52.367
FINANCIALLY OF THE BOARD SO

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:54.369
THAT THESE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:58.606
ARE ALLEVIATE IT AND- CALPERS

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:00.408
AND THAT THERE'S EIGHT THE

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.276
ABILITY OF THE MEDICAL BOARD TO

ABOUT- OUR CONSULTANTS AND-

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.360
THERE IS I THINK IT'S A REAL

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:23.665
NEED TO ENCOURAGE- AREN'T. YOU

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.400
KNOW GOOD QUALITY DOCTORS TO BE

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:29.070
CONSULTANTS AND THE DIFFICULTY

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.606
IS THAT THERE'RE THEY ARE PAID

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:33.875
OF COURSE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:40.548
VERY IT'S VERY YEAH HI AM SET.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.216
TIME- IT'S VERY. IT DOES A LOT

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.185
OF GIVE ME SPENT IN REVIEWING.

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.820
IN WAITING FOR RECORDS COME AND

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:47.522
SO- BUT IN THE PROCESS OF

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:48.690
REVIEWING RECORDS REVIEWING THE

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.725
STANDARDS CARE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.793
WORK BEING DONE BY THE

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:54.529
CONSULTANTS AND- UNFORTUNATELY.

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:57.131
YOU KNOW WE WE'RE IT'S A IT'S A

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.666
VOLUNTARY POOL THERE'S NO

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.101
THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT PEOPLE%

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.869
HAVE TO BE CONSULTANTS- WITH A

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.538
LIMITED POOL TO DRAW FROM.

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.139
WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HADN'T

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:07.208
MORE CONSULTANTS THAT WE COULD.

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.577
DO WE COULD ACCESS YES WORK AND

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.012
POSSIBLY INCREASING THE

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:14.148
RESOURCES WILL- WILL ACCOMPLISH

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.284
THAT AS WELL BUT- I THINK THE

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:18.119
BIGGER ISSUES REALLY ARE

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.854
ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.622

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.491
FINANCES ARE ARE MADE- SET UP

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.893

BODY SOMETHING ONLY BECAUSE

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:36.704
THEY DAYS AND DOUBLE AND WEBER.

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:38.072
IF YOU'LL JUST SUMMER SIXTY

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:41.976
DAYS AND- INFUSING. AND COST

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:42.977
SHARE FROM THE RESPONDENTS

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.213
SPEND THAT THE CASE. WOULD BE

01:29:45.279 --> 01:29:47.215
VERY HELPFUL- I WANTED TO COME

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:49.117
UP AND REALLY CORD PROBLEM IS

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:50.685
MONEY. YOU NEED TO HAVE

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:52.520
RESOURCES THAT THAT IS SOURCES

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:58.059

THE- INDUSTRY. THAT

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.167
INVESTIGATORS. YOU'RE DOING

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:08.436
LEARN THINGS ON YOU. AND THEN

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.470
YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE NEW

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.372

REST WHO DOING HIS JOB AND PLUS

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.377
A YEAR IF IS THERE A THIRD YEAR

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.782
RELIABLE QUALITY. PAINTING THAT

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:21.749
YOU HAVE EXPERT OPINIONS

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.317

PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:31.926

SOMEBODY WILL LOSE IT YES IT'S-

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.296

BEGINNING OF YOUR STATEMENT.

THEM ARE PRACTICING AND THEY

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.938

A MEDICAL THING AND I DON'T

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:54.028
HAPPEN WHEN NOW YOU THINK THAT

THERE'LL BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:09.810
THE NEW. BUT IN OUR STATE IS

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:13.647

YOU CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:29.296

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:16.507
FROM SOME PEOPLE TODAY AND-

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:17.641
IT'S HARD FOR US IN THE

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:18.943
POSITION THAT WE'RE IN AND WE

02:30:19.009 --> 02:30:20.311
DON'T DEAL WITH THESE CASES ON

02:30:20.378 --> 02:30:21.779
A WEEKLY BASIS YOU'RE PART OF

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:24.181
PANELS YOU HEAR. YOU GIVE OF

02:30:24.248 --> 02:30:27.084
YOUR TIME AND- CLEARLY WE'VE

02:30:27.151 --> 02:30:28.419
HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN SUPPORT

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:30.588
AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM. MEMBERS

02:30:30.654 --> 02:30:32.089
OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE NOT HAD

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:33.924
THE BEST RESULT. FOR THEIR

02:30:33.991 --> 02:30:35.226
FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:37.094
ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT AND HARD

02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:42.500
TO HEAR- ON MY DAD- SO IT MAKES

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.368
IT DIFFICULT FOR US- WILL BE

02:30:44.435 --> 02:30:46.604
HERE PROBABLY THOSE WHO ARE

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:51.075
MOST ARE AGGRIEVED BUT- I THINK

02:30:51.142 --> 02:30:53.477
THAT THERE IS SOME. REALLY

02:30:53.544 --> 02:30:54.945
IMPORTANT PIECE HERE ABOUT THE

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:57.348
PUBLIC'S TRUST TO THE TO THE

02:30:57.415 --> 02:30:59.350
POINT OF THE TRUST THAT THE

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:01.652
PUBLIC HAS TO PLACE AND CLEARLY

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:03.187
YOUR VOLUNTEERS YOU ON'T YOU

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:04.355
DON'T NEED TO SERVE YOU

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:06.424
OBVIOUSLY HAVE BUSY LIVES SO I

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:09.427
APPRECIATE THAT IT IS A VERY

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:12.630
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:14.432
IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:16.600
YOU DO. BUT IT IS AN

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:18.602
EXPECTATION AND SO IT IS HARD

02:31:18.669 --> 02:31:19.804
FOR US TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:22.840
FEEL LIKE THE SYSTEM HAS NOT-

02:31:22.907 --> 02:31:25.176
SERVE THEM WELL ALL OUR OUR

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:27.344
ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND- YOU

02:31:27.411 --> 02:31:28.112
KNOW THEY'RE NOT IN THE

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:30.648
POSITION TO JUDGE THAT'S WHY.

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:32.316
THERE IS A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT

02:31:32.383 --> 02:31:33.551
ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT THAT'S

02:31:33.617 --> 02:31:35.719
WHY THERE ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS

02:31:35.786 --> 02:31:37.755
AND INSTITUTIONS IN PLACE LIKE

02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:40.458
THIS AND SO. THAT OUR PUBLIC

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:42.993

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:46.063
THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE-

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:48.265
THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE-

02:31:48.332 --> 02:31:50.401
IN DEPTH. RULES COMMITTEE

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:51.836
HEARINGS IN TERMS OF THE

02:31:51.902 --> 02:31:53.971
CONVERSATION- CLEARLY WE'VE HAD

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:54.872
SOME DIFFICULT WHAT'S IN THE

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:57.208
PAST BUT THIS ONE HAS BEEN.

02:31:57.274 --> 02:32:00.311
MORE SO I ACTUALLY. WOULD LIKE

02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:01.879
EACH OF YOU TO CLOSE TO GIVE ME

SOME CLOSING COMMENTS ON YOUR

02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:05.082
COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC AND

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:07.451
YOUR ABILITY TO BALANCE THESE

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:09.653

IN SUPPORT OF SOME NOT ALL AS A

02:32:20.364 --> 02:32:21.799
GROUP SO I THINK IT WOULD BE

02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:23.334
BETTER TO JUST TAKE EACH MOTION

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:24.235
SEPARATELY WHEN WE GET THERE

02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:26.604

GOVERNOR MADE. A PUBLIC

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:36.066

THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING

02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:39.035

02:44:43.406 --> 02:44:45.675
FOLKS TODAY BUT- WE HAVE

02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:47.544
QUESTIONS WE NEED ANSWERED- I

02:44:47.611 --> 02:44:49.946

INVOLVEMENT IN AN ASSOCIATION

02:45:05.128 --> 02:45:07.864
IS ONE FACTOR. BUT PEOPLE GET

02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:09.132
INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

02:45:09.199 --> 02:45:12.502
