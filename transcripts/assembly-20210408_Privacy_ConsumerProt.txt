THIS IS A GETS HIS FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING AB ARE I PRESENT TO YOU AB THREE SEVEN ONE REGARDING SHARED MOBILITY LIABILITY- CHERT DEVICE LIABILITY AND BRAILLE COSPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR THE FOR THE BLIND THE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE EQUITY IN A SENSIBILITY AB THREE SEVEN ONE REQUIRES EXISTING LIABILITY PROTECTIONS BE EXTENDED TO PEDESTRIANS IFTHEY ARE INJURED BY A SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE SUCH AS AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BIKE COLLECTIVELY E. DEVICES WHETHER IN USE OUR PART THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES ADDITION OF BRAILLE AND TACTILE SIGNAGE WITH REYES CHARACTERS. FOR PEDESTRIANS WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED ALLOWING THEM TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE INTO REPORT BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LOCATED ON PAGES FOUR AND SEVEN ON THE ANALYSIS OF THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN INDEMNITY FOR COULD COMPANIES IF AN ACCIDENT IS CAUSED BY USER NEGLIGENCE SUCH AS DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED ADDITIONALLY THESE AMENDMENTS DELETE ALL REFERENCES TO TRACKING. AS P. DEVICES BECOME A MORE POPULAR MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION PEDESTRIANS FACE AN INCREASED RISK OF INJURY IMPROPERLY PARKED YOU DEVICES AND WRITERS USING THE DEVICES AND A PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY POSE A GREATER DANGER IN CAN LEAD TO SEVERE INJURIES FOR PEDESTRIANS ESPECIALLY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED WHO RELY ON CLEAR WALKWAYS FREE OF HINDRANCE EXISTING LIABILITY COVERAGE IS ALREADY EXTENDED TO USERS INJURED AS A RESULT OF OPERATING DEVICES BUT DOES NOT COVER PEDESTRIANS AND ACCIDENT VICTIMS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION STATE THAT NO SUCH LIABILITY EXISTS FOR ACCIDENT VICTIMS. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE CASE AS OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION SAID THAT THE CAR INSURE LIABILITY COVERAGES AFFORDED TO THOSE INJURED BY A USER OPERATING THESE DEVICES- THUS EXISTING INSURANCE. ASSEMBLY BE EXTENDED TO PEDESTRIANS IN YOUR BY DEVICES AS THE BURDEN OF LIGHT RESPONSE CHAU NOT FOR ON THE- VICTIM. ADDITIONALLY OPPA AS WE CONCERN AS TO WHY THIS BILL APPLIES TO THOSE RENT THE VEHICLE DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE WHO DON'T PERSONAL MOTORIZED VEHICLES. THE KEY DIFFERENCE THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A GREATER PROPENSITY TO INSURE. TO INSURE THEIR OWN DEVICES PARK LOCKED AND STOWED AWAY PROPERLY OUT OF HARM'S WAY WHEREAS THE PURPOSE TO BE DEVICES TO. BE FREELY LEFT IN PUBLIC WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR PEDESTRIANS. PASSAGE WAYS YOUR TYPICAL USER OWNED DEVICES LOCKED AND STORED AS OPPOSED TO THE SHARED DEVICES WE HAVE ALL SEEN LITTERED AND WALKWAYS. FURTHER THE ABSENCE BRAILLE AND TACTILE USES TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS FROM ASSESSING INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVICE COMPANY AFTER AN INJURY. THE ADDITION OF SUCH SIGNAGE WILL GUARANTEE PEDESTRIANS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT CAN PROPERLY IDENTIFY THE DEVICE PROP PROVIDERS CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE NEED TO REPORT. AB THREE SEVEN ONE DISPLACES THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM ACCIDENT VICTIMS. BY AND ENSURING PEDESTRIANS ESPECIALLY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR FORTY EXISTING INSURANCE PROTECTIONS AND ACCESSIBLE CONTACT IDENTIFICATION. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AT THE BILL'S SPONSORS- JEFF TOM. OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. AND- AND PRIVILEGE. MY BROTHER DR FRED JONES. A MEMBER OF THE NON VISUAL COMMUNITY. WHO WHEN I GOT IN MY FIRST MARRIAGE WHEN I WAS- MARY. AND I TURNED ON THE LIGHT FORM IN THE BATHROOM HE TOLD ME. WHY YOU TURN ON THE LIGHT ON BLIND.

SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LET'S START START WITH THE FIRST ONE IS THEN. DR JONES. WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE. MMHM MEMBERS BACK TO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF TOM ON THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF ON. AT THE OUTSET LET ME THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER FOR AUTHORING AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO HARM THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE INDUSTRY. RATHER THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO SOLVE A SIGNIFICANT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ISSUE. THESE HE DEVICES SHARE THE SIDEWALKS WITH PEDESTRIANS. PEDESTRIANS CAN BE INJURED EITHER FROM DIRECT COLLISIONS WITH THESE DEVICES OR BECAUSE OF INJURIES SUFFERED WHEN FALLING OVER CARELESSLY LEFT DEVICES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDEWALK IN FACT MEMBERS OF MY OWN ORGANIZATION HAVE SUFFERED INJURIES IN THIS VERY WAY. THERE IS NO EXISTING INSURANCE THAT COVERS- CONDUCT BY THE END USER. OR THE COMPANIES WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES SUFFERED BY A PEDESTRIAN. THIS BILL WOULD MERELY APPLY EXISTING LIABILITY INSURANCE ALREADY REQUIRED TO SITUATIONS INVOLVING CONDUCT BY THE END USER OR THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE PROVIDER. WHEN A PEDESTRIAN SUFFERS PROPERTY OR PERSONAL INJURY. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND URGENT IVOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR TESTIMONY LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT ONE IS SO AND JUST A REMINDER THAT THERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CALLING IN.

ARE YOU THERE MR MILLER. YES I'M HERE GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME'S BRETT DOLLARS SENIOR PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER AT SPEND HERE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. TO BE CLEAR FROM THE START WE DO NOT DISPUTE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND ARE HAPPY TO ADD HE CONTACT INFORMATION IN BRAILLE ON ALL OF OUR COMBINED FIFTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC SCOOTERS. IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND CERTAINLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IN CALIFORNIA I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ALL SHARED SCOOTER AND E. BIKE PROVIDERS ALREADY HAVE COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERING PEDESTRIAN IN ACCIDENTS WHERE WE AT THE BIKE HONORED ARE NEGLIGENT. HOWEVER WHAT AB THREE SEVENTY ONE AND ASKING FOR IN TERMS OF INSURANCE WILL UNEQUIVOCALLY AND MICHAEL ABILITY IN THE STATE FOR BOTH SHARED COOTER THANK YOU BYE. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT NOT REQUIRED IN ANY OTHER STATE OR COUNTRY BY MAKING MICRO MOBILITY SHARE COMPANY PROFILE BOTH FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF THEIR USERS. MEANING WE WOULD BE LIABLE FOR OUR WRITERS BEHAVIOR. NO OTHER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MODEL POLITICS APPROACH BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHTLY HELD RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. AB THREE SEVENTY ONE WHICH CHANGE THAT IN THIS WAY AB THREE SEVENTY ONE UNFAIRLY SINGLED OUT SHARED-MOBILITY INDUSTRY WELL PRIVATE CITIZEN TO BUY THEIR OWN BIKES SCOOTERS AND MOPEDS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. ALSO AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THE ONLY INSURER FOR MICHAEL BILITY OPERATORS APOLLO HAD ALREADY MADE CLEAR IN WRITING THAT NO INSURANCE PRODUCT CONTEMPLATED HERE EXIT. APPALL AND FURTHER STATED THAT WE WOULD BE RENDERED ON INSURANCE THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. IF ENACTED SUCH COVERAGE WOULD LIKELY BE VERY COST PROHIBITIVE THE POLICY LIMIT PROPOSED IN THIS BILL FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PEDESTRIAN R. SIXTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR CARPET CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY I'M REFERRING TO A ONE MILLION DOLLAR MINIMUM FOR SCOOTERS AND BIKES IN THIS BILL COMPARED TO A FIFTY THOUSAND MINIMUM LIABILITY COVER FOR CARS. CARS THE COURT BECAUSE TECHNICALLY MORE DAMAGED WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED DESPITE THE CANADIAN INVENTION TO DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR LIABILITY CONCERNS. AND BECAUSE THE BILL CONTINUE TO TREAT IT DIFFERENTLY ANY OTHER. GOOD IN OUR CON. LASTLY ARE UP TO THE HERE COMPARE TO TWO. FOR USER IN FACT REALLY UP TO WORK USER WITH THAT CHECK.

DR JONES OUT YES- PLEASE GO AHEAD I THINK- GO AHEAD I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU WERE MUTED THE EARLIER SO PLEASE GO AHEAD- ONE OF MY APOLOGIES FOR ALL OF THE- INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE PROCESS. BUT I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE BILL ON BEHALF OF MY BROTHER. I DON'T REGINALD JONES SAWYER THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL BECAUSE IT WE HAVE BEEN DISABLED COMMUNITY WE HAVE. TO BARRIERS THAT COME WITH IN OUR LIVES AND THEIR ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS AND THEY ARE ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS AND THE BARRIER- THIS BILL. PRESENT THE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIER WHERE IF A PERSON IS CROSSING THE STREET. AND THEY'RE GOING FROM ONE THOUSAND TO THE OTHER. THE SCHOOL THAT'S LEFT IN THE WAY. OF ARCHITECTURAL BARRIER WHICH IF THEY GO AROUND THE FOOD THEY BECOME DISORIENTED AND LOSE THEIR STATE AND PLATE. AND THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE SO THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IF. THEY'RE ALSO INJURED IN THEIR CROSSING THE STREET AND TRIPPING OVER THIS PARTICULAR. EQUIPMENT OR VEHICLE AND THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BE PASSED BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT COMPANY THIS. VEHICLE BELONGS TO THE LIBERAL WOULD BE DONE HELP FOR US. SO WE CAN HELP WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES TO CALL. FOR LIVE A CHARGE. AGAINST THE PERSON WHO OWNS THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE- I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE AGAIN. IT WILL CREATE A- ADDITION TO ARCHITECTURE BARRIERS DEBATE PEOPLE. ALL THE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JONES WE'RE TESTING. OF MR OPERATOR YOU TO SEE IF THERE AT THIS. COLORS EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. YES MISTER TRICK. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH TO SPEAK EITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL THIS IS THE FINAL CALL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. I KNOW WHEN THE SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATOR THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. AT THIS POINT. NO FOR QUESTIONS- VICE CHAIR KILEY COLLETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- IT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM SPEND JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND HOW CURRENT LAW WORKS SO- IF YOU ARE A PEDESTRIAN WHO IS INJURED- BY A USER OF ONE OF YOUR DEVICES- THROUGH THAT USERS NEGLIGENCE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ASSETS OR THEIR JUDGMENT PROOF. I IS IT THE CASE THAT THE INJURED PARTY HAS NO RECOURSE TO YOUR COMPANY AT THAT POINT. YEAH CAN'T DO YOUR QUESTION YEAH. A PEDESTRIAN IS INJURED BY THE ACTIONS OF A USER THEY HAVE- RECOURSE AVAILABLE TO- TAKE ACTION AGAINST THAT USER THE ISSUE HERE IS WHO IS LIABLE THE COMPANY OR THE USER. RIGHT SO INTENSE AND CURRENTLY WHAT'S THE USER AND THERE'S NO LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE USER OR THERE'S NO RECOURSE TO AT THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. IF YES. THE COMPANY OF NEGLIGENT AND HAS DONE SOMETHING AND TO INTO THE PEDESTRIAN BY ACCIDENT THEN OF COURSE WE ARE LIABLE BUT WHEN A USER. YOU KNOW RECKLESSLY ENDANGERS OR INJURES A PEDESTRIAN THAT USER IS RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE RIGHT SO THIS SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CONTEXT OF SAY AUTOMOBILES WERE IF YOU'RE A PEDESTRIAN A TENER YOUR DRIVER WHO GETS HIT THEN- THE PARTY WHO. INJURED YOU IS REQUIRED TO HAVE INSURANCE YOU HAVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL GET RECOVERY BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW WITH RESPECT TO MOBILITY DEVICES THERE ISN'T THAT INSURANCE IS THAT RIGHT. RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX HERE MISTER JONES SAWYER THANK YOU MISTER RILEY COOK KILEY DOES EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA SET UP THAT I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE I MEAN I MIGHT SORT OF JUST INTUITIVELY THINK THAT MAYBE IF. THE CONDUCT OF THE USER IS A RECKLESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT- YOU KNOW. THERE MIGHT BE A MIDDLE GROUND HERE BUT I DO SEE THAT. THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX AND I THINK THE SOLUTION- MAKES SENSE. I MEAN I THINK THAT. THERE MIGHT BE- ALSO ROOM TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT THAT- THE USER- CAN BE LIABLE IF. I MEAN UNDER CURRENT ZONING UNDER CURRENT LAW IS THEIR INABILITY THERE IS AN ABILITY TO. UNDER YOUR BILL YOU CAN STILL RECOVER FROM THE USER IF THEY- IN TERMS OF WITH LIABILITY BE JOINED SEVERAL RUN AUTOMATICALLY GO TO THE COMPANY. SO THIS IS TO ALLOW. DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE OF THAT. THE USER WILL BE COVERED AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO HELP MAKE SURE THAT RECOVERY OF MEDICAL EXPENSES AND THINGS THAT NATURE- RECOVERABLE BY PERSON WHO'S INJURED- SO THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IF THEY'RE THERE IS NO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CRAFT WHAT THAT INSURANCE LOOK LIKE. LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT MIGHT BE A MIDDLE GROUND WHICH WE CAN GET TO YEAH- BUT THERE WERE NO EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AT ONE TIME THERE WAS NO FLOOD INSURANCE SO THIS IS ALMOST LIKE PREEMPTIVE LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY WE CAN PROTECT. NOT ONLY THE PEDESTRIAN THAT ONLY TWO USER BUT ALSO THE COMPANY SO THAT EVERYBODY WILL BE WHO WILL HAVE SOME KIND OF COVERAGE ON THIS OKAY I YEAH I THINK I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT THERE'S NO RECOURSE FOR A PEDESTRIAN IN THE SITUATION I MENTIONED I'M I'M NOT SURE I ALSO LIKE IT IF. THE USER IS SORT OF OFF THE HOOK NO MATTER HOW BAD THEIR CONDUCT IS A MATTER HOW YOU KNOW WELL POSITIONED THEY ARE TO EIGHT IN THE IN THE RECOVERY SO I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT DIRECTION THAT UP I WILL IN FACT THERE ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF EXPRESSED. EXACT SAME THING AS YOU'VE EXPRESSED THIS KIND OF. IT IS. COM OR QUESTIONS. MISTER BENNETT. THE AT THAT YET THANK YOU- YOU YOU AND I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK A LOT ABOUT THIS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS TO A CONVERSATION- I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THERE'S PROPER- PROTECTION FOR. THE RESIDENTS AND CITIZENS THAT- OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE OUT THEY'RE WALKING EXETER AND MAY BE HIT BY OR TRIP OVER OF THESE CALLS- AND THIS BILL. IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO ATTEMPT THAT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- PROPER SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY BY BOTH THE END USER AND THE COMPANY- IN AND MAKING SURE THAT- BOTH OF THEM TAKE THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF PROTECTING- RESIDENTS OUT THERE SERIOUSLY THIS LAST MILE. TRANSPORTATION OPTION IS GOING TO EVOLVE IN CALIFORNIA- AS WE SEE TECHNOLOGY CHANGING CENTER AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO YOUR EXPRESSED NAY- EARLIER TO WORK- WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO ADDRESS MORE OF THE SECOND HALF OF MY EQUATION WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT THE END USER. DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR LIABILITY AT ALL- AND SO I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS EXAMPLES- HAVING THE COMPANIES OFFER- A LIABILITY THAT THE- END USERS COULD PAY A SMALL FEE FOR AND THEREFORE HAVE THEMSELVES COVERED FOR LIABILITY MAYBE IT'S ON A- MONTHLY BASIS ARE PART OF THEIR SUBSCRIPTION NEXT SATURDAY- SUCK SOMETHING WHERE. THE COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SAY HEY WE RENTED IT AND WHETHER YOU HAVE INSURANCE OR NOT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ANY LIABILITY OR NOT WE WERE NOT INTERESTED- THAT'S NOT ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY AND PART OF THE COMPANY I WANT THE COMPANY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE TRIED TO EMPHASIZED HOW MUCH AND YOU HAS. FOR THIS ALSO AND SO- I AM. WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS TO MOVE IT FORWARD OUT OF COMMITTEE- WITH- WITH YOU OR ARE YOU IT WITH YOUR COMMITMENT THAT- YOU'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK RECOGNIZING THEIR- NEEDS TO BE MORE EVOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THE END USER ALSO FEELS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY. NOT JUST A COMPANY HERE. DEFINITELY I WILL I MEAN THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION FROM HER NORMALLY WHEN YOU COME BEFORE COMMITTEE. THEY WANT YOU TO DO YOUR THINGS THIS IS A- THIS IS UNUSUAL YOUR YOU WANT ME TO MAKE MY BILL TOUGHER INSTRUCTORS THIS IS. WHAT THIS IS DIFFERENT AND MORE SPECIFIC AND MORE. OF THE SAME BABY BOOM BALANCE BALANCING OUT TO LIVE THAN USUAL SO IT YES THE BALANCING OUT THE LAURIE IS NOW TRYING TO HARM TO COMPANIES WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S CUP SO THAT THE END USER DOESN'T DOESN'T JUST FEEL LIKE UP IT'S ALL ON THE COMPANY AND THEREFORE. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW RESPONSIBLE I THINK. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- NEXT LET'S GO TO MOST. BY MR GABRIEL FOLLOWED BY MY CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU. WITH GALLAGHER THANK YOU MISS MISS CHAIR- AND THINK YOU TO- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LA FOR BRINGING UP THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL I THINK THAT THE BRAILLE. A PART OF THE BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING OUT- AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHER MEMBERS THE OTHER PART OF THE BILL I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW- FOR THE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME KIND OF. EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ARE OUT FOR THE END USER- I HAVE ALMOST BEEN RUN OVER BY FOLKS IN- THE RED BIKES AS WELL AS THE SCOOTERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN MIDTOWN WITH FOLKS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN. CLEARLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CLEARLY INEBRIATED. WHO SHOULD NOT BE ON THESE MOTORIZED. VEHICLES AND- WELL I DID SEE SOMEONE ACTUALLY GET RUN OVER JUST ON FIFTEENTH IN L. ACROSS IN THE STREET BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT WERE DRINKING AND USING- THE SCOOTERS- WE'RE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE- SO THERE IS I THINK AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO THIS IF YOU'RE ON THE STREET. YOU YOURSELF IF YOU ARE DRINKING AND USING THESE- THE SCOOTERS OF THE RENT BIKES BOB CAN CAUSE HARM TO YOURSELF AND CLEARLY TO A DRIVER IN A CAR THAT MAY NOT TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING CARELESS. YOU MAY CAUSE HARM TO SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF I WAS SIMPLY WALKING MY DOG AND THEY DIDN'T SEE ME AND WERE KIND OF LIKE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND- VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS ABOUT HURTING OTHER PEOPLE SO THERE IS A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ON ONE OF THESE. PROSECUTORS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND NO YOU SHOULD NOT BE DRINKING WHILE ALSO- OF WRITING THESE MACHINES SO I THINK I HOPE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMPANIES TO DO SOME KIND OF EDUCATION CAMPAIGN BEING ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR- SOMETHING THAT GETS TO HAPPEN. SO THAT THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON TE END USER BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ALMOST HURT TWICE. BYE BYE FOLKS SO USING THESE MUCH- I THINK IT'S AN- STEP SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU NUMBER MR GABRIEL. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER TURNER I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN APPRECIATION FOR YOU FOR THIS BILL I THINK JUST TO ADDRESS SOME OF WHAT. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM- FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO FROM SANTA BARBARA BROUGHT UP A COUPLE OF THINGS MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS DOESN'T REMOVE. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A PLAINTIFF TO GO AFTER THE END USER FOR NEGLIGENT CONDUCT SO THEY CAN THEIR STELLAR INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE RIDING THE SCOOTERS TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS I'M MORE TO THE POINT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT UNDERWRITE THE POLICY FOR THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THEM TO DO THINGS TO GIVE THE WRITERS THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO BE SAFER IN WRITING THEM TO NOT LEAVE THEM IN THE WAY. OF DISABLED PEOPLE OR OTHERS IN COLLEGE ENTRY SO SOME OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK THE PRIVATE MARKET IS ACTUALLY GOING TO FIX WHEN WE PASS YOUR BILL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THEY'RE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE WORK ARE USED IN A SAFER WAY THAT DOESN'T INJURE PEOPLE SO TO ME THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY INSURANCE WORKS. IT'S THE PERFECT CASE FOR EXAMPLE FOR INSURANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY THANK. YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER CUNNINGHAM. YEAH I HAD MORE OF QUESTION. ON THE USER LIABILITY PIECE BECAUSE I DON'T. I'VE READ THE ANALYSIS AND- AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. AND I'M A LITTLE ON. UNCLEAR ABOUT IT. I'M SORRY TO ASK A REALLY TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT HERE. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THAT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INCENTIVES ARE PROPERLY ALIGNED BECAUSE- THE USER OF THESE. DEVICES RIGHT- COULD BE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE COULD BE. LEAVING THEM LIKE. A JERK IN THE MIDDLE OF. THE SIDEWALK WERE YOU KNOW VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE HAVE TO WALK. I MEAN YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE. PROLIFERATING AT LEAST IN SACRAMENTO WHEN I'M UP HERE THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE RIGHT- AND I GET THE POINT ABOUT. WANTING THERE TO BE INSURANCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT- IT WAS SO I GUESS. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DRILL DOWN ON IS. UNDER ON HOW WOULD THIS BILL CHANGED WHAT IS CURRENT LAW ON USER. LIABILITY FOR. NEGLIGENT OR RECKLESS CONDUCT. IN EITHER USING THE DEVICE OR LEAVING IT IN A PLACE THAT SHOULDN'T BE LEFT ONE AND HOW WITH THE BILL. CHANGE THE CURRENT LAW SO TECHNICALLY THERE IS NONE. WHAT IS THE BILL WILL DO AS- OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SAID STATED. WILL PUSH US TO EITHER HAVE THE- PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE COMPANY. CORRECT A PRODUCT THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. AND THEN WITH. LOOKING FROM THE INPUT I'M GETTING FROM HERE. WE CAN DEMOCRATS SOMETHING. USE YOUR- LIKE IF LIKE YOUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE TO COVER IT IF YOU. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RENT A CAR. YOU CAN DO THAT. BUT WE NEED SOMETHING SPECIFIC JUST LIKE WHEN YOU. RENT A CAR YOU ALSO CAN SIGN OFF. LIABILITY BY SAYING I HAVE MY OWN. YOU KNOW AUTO INSURANCE SO I DON'T NEED TO BUY YOURS. SO WE'RE LOOKING INTO- AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT SAID. THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS WE CAN. WE CAN PARSES OUT WE JUST NEED TO. FIGURE IT OUT AND HOPEFULLY DISCLOSES YOU TO DISH. WILL BE ABLE TO. TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BY THEM WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT SO THAT. THE CURRENT LOG AND POSES NO LIABILITY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL IS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION COULD CORRECT AND LAND IN A PLACE WHERE THERE'S- SHARED LIABILITY POTENTIALLY BETWEEN- THE MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR OF THE- THE- VEHICLE OR DEVICE SORT OF ACTS CALLED. AND THE USER RATING MEANS- MAKING SURE WHOEVER GETS INJURED. THERE'S SOME KIND OF COVERAGE HERE OKAY BECAUSE I THINK MR MY COLLEAGUE MY NEIGHBOR TO THE SOUTH MISTER BENNETT MAKES A GOOD POINT I MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO REMOVE. USER LIABILITY ENTIRELY I GUESS THERE ISN'T ANY TO BEGIN WITH SO THAT'S NOT GREAT. WHICH IS PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON. YOU SEE. PEOPLE DRINKING AND DRIVING THESE DEVICES LIKE CRAZY AT NIGHT AND YOU SEE THEM LEFT ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE WAY OF EVERYBODY THAT'S WALKING. DURING THE DAY. SO I. SEE THE DIRECTION YOU'RE MOVING I THINK I'M PROBABLY GONNA STAND CO CHANGES FOR NOW BUT- APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS. THANK YOU WHAT'S GOING ON MR GALLAGHER FOLLOWED BY MISSED WICKS FOLLOWED BY MR WHEN. GALLAGHER I THINK THE OTHER I WAS GAY MAKE IT ON THE IN AND DID WOULD ALSO BE. AND MAYBE MAYBE ONE OF THE WITNESSES MAYBE SPEAK TO OTHER BABY SUBROGATION. AVAILABLE FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY IF IT IN FACT THE USER WAS THE ONE NEGLIGENT- THE OTHER QUESTION HAS SO. YOUR BILL ALSO PROVIDES THE DAY ATTACHED SIGNAGE TO EACH DEVICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRACKING AND REPORTING. WHAT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR IS LIKE SO WHAT WOULD THAT YOU TRACKING YOU RECORD THE INFORMATION WHAT ARE WE USING IT FOR. SO IT IS REALLY FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED AFTER SOME TYPE OF BRAILLE OR TACTILE THEATERS IT'S IN ENGLISH BUT IT'S THE REYES BRAILLE SO THAT IF THEY DO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. THEY CAN BEEN. READ ON THE- ON ON THE DEVICE- YOU CAN CONTACT SO YOU CAN- ASSUME LIABILITY NO I GET THAT PART OF IT THIS IS YOUR ADDICT AFFIRMATIVELY ASKING TO BE TRACKED AND REPORTED BY RIGHT THE M. S. P. THOUGH. RIGHT SO WHAT WHAT MEAN I GUESS- THE- AND THEN ALSO IT'S NOT JUST THE NAME BUT IT'S ALSO AN ALPHANUMERIC ID IS TO YOU CAN DO BOTH. THE SAY DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE EITHER OR- AT WORK I'M NOT SURE WE CAN HAVE- WHICH IS NICE AND WHAT IS FUNNY ALL THE A AND I GUESS I MEAN THAT WAS ENOUGH I MEAN. I SHOULD HAVE 2% IN THE CALIFORNIA. YEAH RIGHT MAYBE I CAN ANSWER IT WILL BE MISSED. MR JEFF TOM TOM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND MAYBE TO CLARIFY- TOP OF THE- YEAH MISTER KARGER WHICH YOU READ WE ASK A QUESTION MAYBE JUST TO CLARIFY LIKE OBVIOUS I AGREE WITH THE PART ABOUT HAVING THAT ON THERE SO THAT A BLIND PERSON COULD IDENTIFY. WHICH COMPANY OWNS THIS- YOUR DEVICE THAT IS INJURED THEM- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH AN ALPHANUMERIC ID- I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE NAME SO THAT I CAN THEN PROCEED WITH. THE CLAIM THAT I NEED TO MAKE. I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO- HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK IT'S- THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE- PHONE VISION IMPAIRED PERSON. YOU KNOW TRACKING THE END USER THAT'S REALLY- SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY. YOU KNOW HAS THE- YOU. KNOW WHETHER WHETHER THEY DESIRE TO DO THAT OR NOT IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THEIR INDEMNIFICATION. ON BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S JUST TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. INTO THE HANDS OF THE VISION IMPAIRED PERSON IN ORDER TO CALL THE SCOOTER OPERATOR. OKAY. IS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISSED WEEKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU- MISTER JONES SAWYER- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I THINK YOU'VE- JUMPED INTO AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSES- AND THERE'S A LOT OF GRAY AREA AND RIGHT BUT I APPRECIATE YOU DIVING RIGHT IN HEAD FIRST- AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT LIABILITY ISSUES- AND THAT THE COMPANIES TO BE TO TAKE. SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE. ONE OF HOWEVER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS- POINTS THAT WAS RAISED- TO ME BY THE OPPOSITION WAS- THAT THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE PRODUCT DOESN'T EXIST CURRENTLY AND THAT THAT COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S I JUST WAS CURIOUS WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WAS TO THAT- OF. IT I THINK I SAID EARLIER AT ONE TIME THERE WAS NO FLOOD INSURANCE NOTE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE- HAVE ACTORS DURING THOSE SHIRTS FOR ENSURING ATHLETES AT ONE TIME- RIGHT NOW THEY NEED TO GET SOME- SOME DATA. SO THEY CAN KIND OF MEASURE HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST- I THINK WORKING WITH THE- CALIFORNIA BLIND ASSOCIATION- WEEK DOES HE AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTS AND WE CAN GET THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. SO THEY CAN FILL OUT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT ALGORITHM IS SOLUTION COME UP WITH A PRODUCT AND OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO PRICE IT ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND ENERGY THAT THAT'S HELPFUL AND YOU'VE DO YOU THINK THAT- THERE'S ROOM FOR. AND ON THIS MOVING. WITH OPPOSITE OR- SO I BELIEVE IF WE'RE GOING FROM THE POINT OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE- WE PROTECT. PEOPLE WHO GT INJURED- WE CAN GET WE CAN GET THERE YEAH WE JUST WORKING TOWARD THAT AND NOT. TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS THEN I THINK WE CAN QUICKLY GET TO THAT BUT IF WHERE WE'RE IF WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT COST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE REASON THE DISABILITY. COMMUNITY WANTED- KIRK AT. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS TOO MUCH IT'LL BANKRUPT THE GOVERNMENT WELL WE NOW HAVE CURB CUTS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS NEEDED. AND SO- IT'S ABOUT. WANTING TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE WE COULD FIND A WAY OKAY AND I'M I'M CAUSING THE BILL AND I'M SUPPORTING IT TODAY I AM AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO. DEFINITELY APPRECIATED THANKS RG MISTER JONES SAWYER. MISTER WHEN. THANK GOD FINAL. ALL AND CERTAINLY- WORK WALDRON YEAH BLAMES IT ALL AND SINCE THAT ALL. REUTERS YEAH- THIS IS VERY. SIMILAR TO THE- SITUATED TO THE A BILL THAT WE'VE ON A OF YEARS AGO AND WHICH WAS SIDE INSURANCE FOR- FOR COMPANIES THAT HAD GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND WE ENDED UP IT IT ENDED UP NOT PASSING BECAUSE THAT PRODUCT DOESN'T EXIST YET DUE TO THE ACTUARIAL IS AREN'T THERE THE PRODUCT DOESN'T EXIST IN A WAY THAT WILL REALLY- CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO FIRST FOR ME TO BE CONSISTENT I'M I'M JUST GONNA ABSTAINED TODAY BUT I WANT TO SEE WAT THE BILL LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT GETS. TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE- I DON'T THINK THAT AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN FORCE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE- EVEN IF THAT'S OUR- WHOLE. SO I'VE I'VE I HOPE THAT AS THIS GOES THROUGH THE INSURANCE- COMMITTEE HAD RABAL TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS REALLY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE SIDEWALK AND ARE DEALING WITH- THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIORS SO- HOPE TO VOTE FOR IT ON FOURTH. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU- MISTER JONES SAWYER FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS- ON THIS BILL- WE'VE HAD A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- I ONLY SAY THAT UP I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE- INDUSTRY. BUT YET I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEDESTRIAN ALSO WHO MAY BE INJURED WITHOUT RECOURSE SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL IS A GREAT START- I YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. HAS TO ADAPT I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO KIND OF TWEAKED A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW- AND TAKEN AS A WHOLE YOU KNOW I AM A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA. SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TRY TO SORT OUT SOME OF THE- THE WILL OF THE DIFFICULTIES ALONG THE WAY. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND IT'S A- SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR SO AT THIS POINT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM- THAT THE OPPOSITION FIVE STATE THEY CAME IN. KIND OF RECENTLY TO TALK TO IS ABOUT THE CONCERNS E HAVEN'T FULLY FLESHED OUT EVERYTHING THAT DAY THEY TALKED ABOUT. BUT WORK WORK ENERGETICALLY WILLING TO MAKE SURE THIS GETS DONE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT. IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US. THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THIS DONE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVER YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR THE- YEAH THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE COMPANIES TO SEEK INDEMNITY. FROM THE END USER. OF FOR THE THEIR PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE LIABILITY HAS BEEN MENTIONED SUCKS SO WITHOUT DOUBT MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL DOUBLE. THE MOTION AS DO PASSED THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE PROCESSED AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. CHAFF HI SHALL I KILEY. BAUER-KAHAN RK HAND AYE BENNETT AYE BENNETT AYE CORREA. CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NOT VOTING GABRIEL. APRIL I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN NOTHING- WE'RE NOT VOTING LEE. HI LEAI WICKS WICKS HI. HAS THAT HAS THE COUNT IS SEVEN TO ZERO AND THAT BILLS OUT THE BILL IS OUT AND LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR Q. THAT JOB BRINGS UP TO THE NEXT ITEM I KNOW THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO IN FINAL ORDER BUT I AM WILLING TO AND I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER MY BILLS- SO THAT UP MY COLLEAGUES COULD GO IN FRONT OF ME SO- WITH THAT I THINK THE NEXT STEP. A BILL IS GOING TO BE ITEM NUMBER TEN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT THAT'S MISS IRWIN I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO BILLS YES AND YEAH AND- FIVE- THIS WICKS HAS TWO BILLS TO PRESENT SO WHAT WOULD IT BE OKAY IF WE LISTEN TO A FIFTY NINE FIRST ABSOLUTELY. SURE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. CALIFORNIANS HAVE MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY AND ALLOWING BIG GOVERNMENTS TO DO REAL TIME TRACKING OF THEIR LOCATION NOT ONLY CONFIRMS THEIR FEARS BUT IT ALSO RUNS COUNTER TO LAWS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE. I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT TO AB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH I'M A JOINT AUTHORS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AB EIGHT FIFTY NINE AND FORCES LIMITS ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY ABILITY TO COMPEL MOBILITY DATA FROM COMPANIES AFFIRMING THE MOBILITY DEVICE INFORMATION IS COVERED UNDER. THE CURRENT PROVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT AS IT RELATES TO CALIFORNIA. BERMAN COLLECTION OF LOCATION INFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OPINION I REQUESTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERMITTING OPERATIONS THAT COMPEL TRIP DATA FOR MOBILITY DEVICES ARE GOVERNED BY KELEFA REQUIRING EITHER THE USER'S CONSENT OR A COURT ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCORRECTLY AND DANGEROUSLY DISPUTING THIS INTERPRETATION ARGUING ARGUING THAT KELEFA ONLY APPLIES TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND COLLECTING THIS LOCATION WITHOUT USERS CONSENT OR A COURT ORDER AND I ALSO HAVE TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS BY- YOUR STAFF- ON PAGE TEN IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE C. P. S. IT SAYS THE CQC HAS EXCLUSIVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER TNCS. THE CQC HAS ALREADY IMPOSED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON SIMILAR TRIP DATA WHICH CAN BE SHARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE THAT DATA. SHARED BY THE C. B. CPUC THEY DO NOT HAVE THE STATUTORY ABILITY TO COMPEL THE DATA FROM TNCS DIRECTLY. THIS BILL SIMPLY SEEKS TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW WHILE PROVIDING A PATH FORWARD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO USE. PRIVACY PROTECTED FORMS OF DATA LIKE AGGREGATE COUNTY IDENTIFIED DATA FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BILL'S LABOR OPPOSITION AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING A SOLUTION AS WE MOVE INTO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. BUT WE NEED TO STRESS THAT WHILE WE WILL SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND MEET LABOUR'S NEEDS TO PROTECT WORKERS THE BILL MUST CONTINUE TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS PRIVACY RIGHTS AS WELL. AS A LEAD TO LEGISLATURE WE MUST TAKE A STAND ON AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY WE MUST MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT IN CALIFORNIA RENTING A SCOOTER OR GETTING A RIDE FROM AN APP DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIVE YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. NOR DOES IT MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS UNFETTERED RIGHT TO TRACK YOUR MOVEMENT. AND MICHAEL MOVOTO WE- ONE OFFERED THEIR TECH TEAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AFTER PRESENTING THE BILL TODAY I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR ON AB EIGHT FIVE NINE I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO YOUR COMMENTS. LOCATION DATA IS INTRINSICALLY SENSITIVE WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REVEAL OUR CONSTITUENTS DEEPLY PRIVATE INFORMATION SUCH AS THEIR HOME WORK. PLEASE PLACE OF WORSHIP MEDICAL PROVIDERS ADDRESSES AND MORE. THIS DATA MUST BE PROTECTED. WELL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND KEEPING OUR SIDEWALKS CLEAR ARE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE CANNOT IGNORE IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS ON GOVERNMENT SEARCHES. AB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DATA COLLECTION AUTHORITY THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. BY PERMITTING THESE ENTITIES TO ACQUIRE DE IDENTIFIED AND AGGREGATED MICRO MATILDE DATA DEVICE DATA. THE BILL WILL STRIKE AN IMPORTANT BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL PLANNING NEEDS AND CALIFORNIA IS CONSTITUTIONALLY AND STATUTORILY PROTECTED RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATE NUMBER IRWIN AND EVERY STAKEHOLDER AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. AND WE FIND MORE COMMON GROUND AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE LEADER REYNOLDS GENERAL MANAGER FOR LA DOTD IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE NINE. TO MANAGE THE FORTY THOUSAND DOCKLESS DEVICES OPERATING IN LOS ANGELES WE REQUIRE BASIC INFORMATION FROM FOR PROFIT COMPANIES WITHOUT THE DATA WE COULD NOT RESPOND TO BLOCK SIDEWALKS ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS OR VERIFY SAFETY OUR SYSTEM IS NOT BUILT TO RECEIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM RIDERS BUT WE PROTECT IT AS IF IT DID. WE STORE DATA AND AGGREGATE WE DO NOT RECEIVE REAL TIME TRIP DATA WE BLOCK THIS DATA FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND NEVER SHARE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ABSENT A SUBPOENA AFTER ALMOST THREE YEARS OF RUNNING OUR PROGRAM SPECULATION ABOUT COMPROMISED DATA HAS PROVEN FALSE BUT COMPANIES HAVE PROVIDED INCOMPLETE FLAWED AND MANIPULATED DATA. CONSUMER PRIVACY IS ESSENTIAL BUT THIS BILL WILL FORCE US TO REGULATE BLINDFOLDED AS STATED BY THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHAOS AND SUCCESSFUL DIGITALLY MANAGE MODE IS MEANINGFUL REGULATION AND ROBUST DATA AB EIGHT SEVEN FIVE NINE WOULD STIFLE INNOVATION AND PREMATURELY BLOCK CITIES FROM SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF FUTURE MOST LIKE EIGHTIES AND AROUND.

A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE NEED MORE CREATURES GIVEN THESE COMPANIES HAVE A LONG TRACK RECORD OF UNDERMINING REPORT POLICY GOAL ESTABLISHED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. UNDER THE GUISE OF PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY AB EIGHT FIVE NINE WOULD ALLOW THESE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY BY RENDERING THE DATA THEY PROVIDE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEARLY USELESS. IF THE AUTHOR IN HER COALITION ARE TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT DATA PRIVACY OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A STATUS IN PROTOCOL STANDARDS AND IF NEEDED PENALTIES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR FAILURE TO PROTECT CONSUMER DATA. INSTEAD EIGHTY FIVE NINE WOULD TIE THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO EFFECTIVELY REGULATE THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS WHAT IS AT THIS POINT I THEORETICAL PROBLEM AROUND DATA SECURITY IN THE.

MORNING MY NAME IS TERRY JOHNSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIRPORT COUNCIL WE ARE SPEAKING AND OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE BY. SIXTY ONE. WHERE NAY BAYARDO SEIU CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WOULD SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATOR LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER BENNETT FILED BY MISTER CUNNINGHAM. F. NOT TO GO TO QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS OF ONE WHAT IS YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT THE CITY'S CAN RECEIVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED THAT IS THE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT RECEIVING THE PERSONAL DATA- INFORMATION OF THE ACTUAL USER OF THE- OF THE OF THE OF THE EQUIPMENT AND PARTICULARLY AS- THIS WHOLE AREA OF FALSE- IN TERMS OF LAST MILE AS I MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY- SO WHAT'S YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL WHICH ACCOUNT IS LEVEL THAT THE BILL CAN ACCURATELY REFLECT- THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN. CITIES AND OTHERS WHO NEED TO TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION BUT- THEY DON'T NEED THE IDENTIFICATION CAN HELP ME WITH THAT PLEASE SO WE HAVE NOT HEARD A VERY GOOD ARTICULATION OF LIFE INDIVIDUAL TRIP DATA IS NEEDED EXCEPT FOR POTENTIALLY CONVENIENCE LATER ON WE ARE READY ALLOWING OPERATIONAL DATA AND DE IDENTIFIED DATA. SO AND IN ALL THE STATE AGAIN OF WE CAN HAVE ALL THE ARGUMENTS FROM THESE CITIES ON OF WHY THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS DATA BUT IT IS ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED BY KELEFA. SO IT'S IT IS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SHOULD NOT BE COLLECTING REAL TIME LOCATION DATA THAT REAL TIME LOCATION DATA IS ALMOST AS SENSITIVE AS MEDICAL DATA BECAUSE YOU GET A COUPLE OF POINTS AND YOU HAVE THE CITIES THAT KNOW WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND YOU BASICALLY ARE ABLE TO TRACK SOMEBODY. TO THEIR HOME AND EVERY OTHER STUFF ALONG THE WAY IT'S ACTUALLY OF FRIGHTENING IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT WAS A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THAT SHOWED HOW WITH THIS DATA YOU COULD TRACK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT. THE CITY SO- I THAT CAN WERE WITH A AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE- INFORMATION THEY NEED. WITHOUT GOING AGAINST WHAT THE LEGISLATURE VOTED FOR A FEW YEARS AGO. WHICH WAS SKALICA SO YOU YOU YOU YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A TECHNICAL SOLUTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET. WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS GOING WITHOUT NECESSARILY GETTING THE INFORMATION ON WHO THE OPERATOR IS OF THAT QUICK. THE DAY UP WITHOUT THE REAL TIME- WITHOUT THE REAL TIME DATA AND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE HEARD SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION FROM FROM THE FROM THE- LABOR TODAY- AND- THE- BUT I THINK THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT- THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT I SUPPORT THIS BILL IT WOULD BE. CONTINGENT UPON YOU WORKING THE WORKING THESE ISSUES OUT ITH LABOR- BEFORE THIS MOVES- AFTER AFTER THIS COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT YOUR LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO WORKING THIS OUT WITH LABOR AND- THE SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION WE HEARD HERE TODAY. AND BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T- WE CAN'T MOVE THIS FORWARD OF THE BEYOND THIS COMMITTEE WITHOUT A WORKING SOMETHING OUT WITH LABOR- WE WITH. WE THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM. BUT I WILL STATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO- FOR WAGE ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT HAVING GOVERNMENT- COLLECT ALL THIS DATA AND- THAT'S BASICALLY A COURT ORDER OR SUBPOENA OUR OR OR- COMPLAINTS THAT COULD BE AND GIVEN IN TO THE- CITY ATTORNEY. YEAH WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE SUPPORTING- THE INDUSTRY AND HIDING LABOR INFORMATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HIDE LABOR ABUSES AND I THINK THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE- ISSUE THAT LABOUR'S SPRING UP HERE SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS CONTINGENT UPON THAT YOUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO TO DO THAT TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THAT NO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND IT STRENGTHENS TWO REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TO ME AS WE MOVE INTO THE ELECTRONIC DIGITAL AGE WHERE WE ARE CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF BEING SURVEILLED BY THE DEVICES WE HAVE ON A SORT DEVICES WE USE- EVEN IF WE HOPE THEY'RE NOT BEING. SURVEILLED YOUR ONE IS THAT THE DATA SHOULD BE DE IDENTIFIED AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE AND TO. I THINK THIS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW- IT TOO IS IF THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET. INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LOCATION IT SHOULD GET A WARRANT. I MEAN THESE ARE NOT OUR THINGS IN MY FORMER LIFE AS A PROSECUTOR- I'VE WROTE PLENTY WARRANTS. IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD REASON YOU GET A JUDGE TO FIND THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE A HOMICIDE OR SOMETHING YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE SOMEBODY WENT ON A PARTICULAR NIGHT THEIR SUSPECT IT. IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE PROCESS TO DO THAT BUT IT'S A FAIRLY IMPORTANT THING THAT WE REQUIRE THAT THAT BE DONE- YOU KNOW UNDER FOURTH AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. I GUESS MY QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I LISTEN TO ALL THE OPPOSITION AND I GET THE LABOR PEACE ON YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE- THAT. THE LABOR STANDARDS ARE BEING FORCED AND I HEAR YOUR RESPONSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE THAT THERE ARE EXISTING MECHANISMS FOR DOING THAT. J. THINK IT'S A FAIR RESPONSE- HERE THE CITY OF LA AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL WE'RE ALREADY DOING ALL THESE THINGS THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE BUT WERE OPPOSED TO SITE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. WOULD NEED REAL TIME LOCATION DATA. SO IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION I GUESS. IN THE AIRWAVES HERE WHATEVER. THEY CAN. ANSWER THAT BECAUSE I DID OT HEAR THAT. ARGUMENT MADE FROM ANYBODY THAT'S A THOUSAND. WHAT THE OPPOSITION- LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION ANYBODY FROM THE OPPOSITION SIDE. YEAH THIS IS THE LEADER REYNOLDS- FROM LA DOT I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND. IF YOU CAN HEAR ME GO AHEAD YES WE HEAR YOU GO AHEAD PLEASE. SURE GREAT SO I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT I HAVE HEARD REPEATED A COUPLE TIMES HERE WHICH IS- WE DO NOT GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS ON ANY OF THESE DEVICES. THE INFORMATION COMES TO US IN A RANDOMLY ASSIGNED NUMBER AND WE ONLY KNOW THIS COMPANY HAD A DEVICE AT THIS LOCATION I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE DON'T IF THE USER. STOPS THE TRIP- OR START THE TRIP WE DO NOT GET THAT DATA IN REAL TIME EITHER THERE'S A LACK ON THAT DATA BEFORE REBOOT WE RECEIVE IT HOWEVER IF A COMPANY- DROPPED A BUNCH OF SCOOTERS ON A CORNER. WE DO GET THAT INFORMATION SO THE COMPANY CREATES AN EVENT WE GET THAT INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT HOW MANY DEVICES EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY CAN HAVE ON EACH INDIVIDUAL CORNER. IN VERY CROWDED PLACES LIKE KOREATOWN IN VENICE- WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING AND OTHERWISE USING THE SIDEWALK. SO FOR US- THE MAIN SORT OF STICKING POINT HERE IS THE AT THE AGGREGATION REQUIREMENTS SO FOR US TO RECEIVE AGGREGATED DATA FROM A COMPANY MEANS THAT A COMPANY CAN MANIPULATE IT BEFORE WE RECEIVE IT. AND WE ARE RECEIVING THIS DATA IN ORDER TO CHARGE FEES AND TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR REGULATIONS THAT ADDRESS EVERYTHING FROM RACIAL EQUITY TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SO FOR YOU KNOW OUR LONG TRACK RECORD OF EXPERIENCE AS REGULATORS IS THAT COMPANIES HAVE A BUSINESS REASON TO MANIPULATE. DATA IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FEES THEY PAY OR TO INCREASE NUMBER THE OF THEIR FLEET THEY CAN HOW ON THE WAY. SO THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN PIECE OF THE MAIN PIECE OF THE BILL THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US- BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS GO OUT AND DO SPOT CHECKS MEANING. THEY START ARRIVING AND DERIDE AND WE SEE IF THAT DATA IS COMING INTO OUR SYSTEM IN A VERIFIABLE WAY SO THAT WE CAN TRUST ALL OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE RECEIVING. FROM COMPANIES AND AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND THINK ABOUT A DRONE DELIVERIES AND THINK ABOUT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND THINK ABOUT. REGULATION OF OTHER FORMS OF A MOBILITY THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN IMAGINED YET- HAVING VERIFIABLE DATA ABOUT DEVICES NEVER EVER ABOUT USERS IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW A FEW SOLUTIONS TO COMMENT TO CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER LEGAL HAD. I WANT TO THANK OUR AUTHORS FOR ANY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE BRING THIS BILL FOR IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN DATA TRANSPARENCY IN PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFEGUARDING THAT OF OUR OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M OFF TO MAKE THIS A BRIEF BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CULTURAL COMMITTEE NOW BUT YOU KNOW I THINK. WITH THAT BEING SAID. WE LIVE IN AN ERA RIGHT NOW WHERE THAT IMMENSE. DATA RIGHT NOW HAS SUCH GREAT USES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. PROPERLY PLAN OUR STREETS AND ALSO MAKE A PROP TWENTY TWO THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONCERN TO MAKE SURE THE P. DRIVERS AND THE PEOPLE UTILIZING THESE. TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING WELL PROTECTED SO- I DEFINITELY RESPECT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WITH ALL THE CONCERNS I CAN'T BE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW. BUT I DO THINK IT'S A WORTHY YET. OR THE BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA. IS THERE ARE. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS AREA AT YOUR LOCATION IS ONE AREA THAT. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON BOTH OF YOU AND- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND- I DO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY TWO NEW OPPOSITION- THE BILL. WENT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE- LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT IT DID RECEIVE. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN. SO THEN I THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO. CONFINED TO A LITTLE BIT GOING FORWARD SO I AM VERY COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING IT- TODAY- AND ALSO. ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I THINK- I THINK YOU HAVE FOUGHT. TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE I THINK THAT. IT'S YOU'RE ALMOST THERE SO. TO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SO. SO WITH THAT- I DON'T LIKE TO ASK YOU TO CLOSE. I THINK I'LL KNOW THE- THERE'S MOTION YET. LIKE DR MOTION FOR THE BILL. ON THE- VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND PLEASE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY OF A MISTER SIX PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

FIRST IN- THE IGLOO WE CALL ROOM FORTY TWO- TO. I THINK I BROUGHT THE WRONG JACKET. GOING TO HAVE A SECOND MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB EIGHT FOURTEEN WOULD PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FROM ENGAGING. IN CONTACT TRACING IN PLACE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON DATA COLLECTED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES SPECIFICALLY THE BILL PROHIBITS DATA COLLECTED RECEIVE HER PREPARED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES FROM BEING USED MAINTAINED OR DISCLOSED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER PURPOSES THAN FCILITATING CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS. AS WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST YEAR ONE OF THE STRATEGIES DEPLOYED TO LIMIT THE TRANSMISSION OF KOBE NINETEEN IS THE USE OF CONTACT TRACING WHICH IDENTIFIES COVE IN NINETEEN POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. AND THOSE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH FOR ADVISED TO SELF QUARANTINE LIMITING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS SUCCESSFUL CONTACT TRACING REQUIRES THE SHARING OF SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING A PERSON'S NAME ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER AND OTHER PERSONAL IDENTIFYING DATA. IN MAY OF LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LAUNCHED CONNECTED CALIFORNIA A STATEWIDE CONFERENCE OF CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. IN DECEMBER THE STATE LAUNCHED CALIFORNIA NOTIFY AN APPLICATION THAT CALIFORNIA'S CAN DOWNLOAD ON THEIR PHONE THAT WILL NOTIFY USERS OF ANOTHER APPLICATION USER THEY'VE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE NINETEEN. WELL THIS INFORMATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY STOP THE SPREAD OF THE CORONA VIRUS AND FUTURE PANDEMICS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF POTENTIALLY BEING USED. FOR NON HEALTHCARE RELATED PURPOSES INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY. TO WILLINGLY INTERACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT YOU TO DISTRUST AND FEAR AND HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CODE NINETEEN. CONTACT TRACING IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE FUNCTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND UTILIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CONTACT TRACE WILL CREATE DISTRUST IN CONTACT RAISING EFFORTS AND HINDER OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS. AB EIGHT FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT THE DATA PRIVACY. OF CALIFORNIANS AND BUILD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM. NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM FURTHER SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN. AND INTENTIONAL FUTURE PANDEMICS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

EXISTING DATA PRIVACY LAWS DO NOTADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM THE MANY WAYS THAT DATA CAN BE NEXT YEAR. THE LACK OF PRIVACY PROTECTION JEOPARDIZES PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS IF PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFORMATION THEY SHARE WITH CONTACT RECORDS WILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND USED ONLY TO ATTRACT THE PANDEMIC. THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION TO CONTACT YOU ABOUT WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN AND WHO THEY'VE BEEN INTERACTING WITH.

CONCERNS AROUND DATA PRIVACY ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS CITED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR THEIR HESITATION TO ENGAGE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES LIKE CONTRACT TRACING WELL ADVOCATES AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ALIKE ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO CURB THIS HESITANCY IT ONLY MAKES OUR COLLECTIVE JOB HARDER WHEN WE CANNOT GUARANTEE STATUTORY PROTECTIONS OF PEOPLE'S INFORMATION PRIVACY. ESPECIALLY FROM BEING SHARED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT STATUTORY PROTECTION DO EXIST FOR PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID AND COVERED CALIFORNIA PREVENTING ANY DATA SHARING WITH NOT ONLY ONE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT BUT WITH ANY PARTY FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM THESE PROTECTIONS IN STATUTE OFFER A POWERFUL REASSURANCE TO COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE CONCERNED OR HAS. TO ENROLL AND SIMILARLY STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED FOR CONTACT TRACING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF IMMIGRANTS AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION POTENTIALLY BEING USED AGAINST THEM SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FOURTEEN.

FOR EXAMPLE SIGN IN SHEETS ARE NOT COLLECTED FOR PURPOSES THE CONTACT RATING THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED RECEIVED A REPAIR PERSON CONTACT TRACING OF THEIR HELPFUL IF THEY ARE USED TO SUPPORT CONTACT RAISING EFFORTS HOWEVER AB FOURTEEN WOULD END UP PROHIBITING THE USE OF THOSE SIGN IN SHEETS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT COLLECTIVELY FOR EXCLUSIVELY USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF. THE CONTACT TRACING A SECOND AB FOURTEEN REQUIRES THAT ALL DATA COLLECTED RECEIVED COMPARED FOR CONTRACTORS MUST BE DELETED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE EXPLICIT EXCEPTIONS FOR REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS EXISTING LAW INCLUDING CAL OSHA GUIDANCE RELATED CODE NINETEEN IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH EXISTING LAW THE BILL DATED TWO WEEKS REQUIREMENTS MAKE QUARTER OTHERWISE USEFUL INFORMATION FROM BEING USED FOR CONTACT TRACING.

WRITTEN OUT WELL WE APPRECIATE DOCTORS TO ENSURE THE HANDLE THE PERSON DAY. AFTER LUNCH IN THE NATION AND WE ACTUALLY CREATE A DETERRENCE TO COLLECTING THE SECRETARY DAY AFTER OUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS CENTERS ON THE LIABILITY CREEK IN THE BILL THE BILL EXPOSES BUSINESSES TO POTENTIAL EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY LAWSUIT INCLUDING RECOVERY OF PLAINTIFF ATTORNEY FEES. WHICH IS AN OVERLY PUNITIVE APPROACH TO TAKE ON BUSINESS OF ATTEMPTING TO TRACK DATA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH REASONS AND WHO WERE NOT IN DISAGREEMENT THAT PERSONAL DATA SHOULD BE HANDLED RESPONSIBLY AND COMPLAINTS OF CURRENT LAW. I THINK THAT IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY THIS BILL OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE IN ITS APPROACH ON HOW THEY DID IT HANDLED WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL LAWSUIT DURING A TIME WHEN OUR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS CAN LEAST AFFORD TO BEAR THE COST OF INCREASED LITIGATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU. LET'S GO TO ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION AMISH. DROP RETURN PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES. FOR THOSE OPPOSITE TO THE BILL.

SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WOULD SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. VERY GOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATIVE LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTION- CHAIR KILEY PLANT. I'M I WANT US WITH THIS PROVISION- THAT- THAT BARS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PARTICIPATING IN CONTRACTORS IN BECAUSE- OVER THE LAST YEAR YOU KNOW WE HAVE. DEPUTIZE MANY PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS- TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO ENFORCE MASS MANDATES- CURFEWS. AND SEEN VIDEOS OF SUPER SPREADER PARTIES. AT BEING BROKEN UP AND- A LOT OF FOLKS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN RESISTANT TO THIS IDEA SAYING THAT'S NOT REALLY. WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR- THE NOW WE HAVE A BILL THAT FOR ONE PARTICULAR% FACET OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONTACT TRACING- IN NOT THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN. YOUR CITY CAN'T EVEN DO THAT IF THEY'RE SO INCLINED SO WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE IS TO. WATER LEGITIMATE PUBLIC HEALTH RELATED USES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL ON ONE ARM. TO PHILOSOPHICAL. A AND- I THINK WE CAN DEBATE IT FOR. A LONG TIME TO COME I THINK WE'VE SEEN. COUNTY BY COUNTY SHERIFF'S EXPRESSING THEIR INTEREST IN USING DISCRETION ABOUT ENFORCING ANY NUMBER OF LAWS. RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN. OR ANYTHING ELSE REGARDING WHAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE THY ONLY HAVE SO MUCH BANDWIDTH OF SO MUCH MANPOWER. SO YOU KNOW WE HEAR THIS YOU KNOW. OUTSIDE OF THE PANDEMIC AS WELL- LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRIORITIZING HOW THEY DO ENFORCEMENT MORE BROADLY. I THINK IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE MORE SPECIFICALLY AND WHY IT'S ADDRESS IN THIS BILL- IT'S REALLY ABOUT. BUILDING TRUST. IN THE CONTACT RACING PROCESS WANT MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. AND THIS DOES THAT. IT HEALTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MR GAVE UP I HAD. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE OPERATE ME VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S- IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT EFFORT. I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU MAYBE I JUST MISS UNDERSTANDING PART OF IT IS- IN TERMS OF ALLOWING SOME OF THE DATA TO BE CAPPED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU EXPLORE TOPPED WITH. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE RESEARCHERS ARE OTHERS ABOUT BECAUSE I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. THE INITIATIVE TO WANT TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE IMMIGRATION FOURTH RESPECT I'M A 1000% SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO MAYBE TWEAK IT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT PUBLIC HEALTH FOLKS AND RESEARCHERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT DATA. YOU KEEP IT OVER TIME BECAUSE THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW THAT EIGHT MONTHS FROM NOW. THAT DATA WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE YEAH AND WE'RE ENGAGE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ON ON HOW TO DO THAT AS WE MOVE INTO THE PROCESS AND WHILE I. YOU KNOW MAKE THAT COMMENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SINCE LAST YEAR- THIS THIS ISN'T A SIMPLE ONE TO ADDRESS SO- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. YEAH NO THAT'S GREAT AND I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN YOU THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE ALL THIS I THINK WE'VE JUST SEEN EXAMPLES OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND- JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE ROBUST RESERVOIRS OF DATA ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ABLE TO USE THAT TO PROTECT THEIR- THEIR- THEIR POPULATIONS I THINK THIS WOULD BE- YOU KNOW TO IT TO WALK THAT LINE OR WE CAN DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WOULD BE GREAT. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MR GALLAGHER GO AHEAD PLEASE. YEAH I THINK LIKE. OTHERS IS. I MEAN. I AM. AGREED KIND OF THE PREMISE IN THE BILL- OF WANTING TO ENSURE THAT IT'S ONLY THE OTHER DAY IS ONLY BEING USED FOR THAT PURPOSE- WHAT ABOUT LIKE DATA THAT YOU MAY WANT TO RETAIN- YOU KNOW FOR CONDUCTING FURTHER. PUBLIC HEALTH RELATED CONTACT TRACING AND IN THAT CASE IT MIGHT BE LIKE NUMBER RIGHT INTO TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. IS THAT. SO I WAS LIKE THIS WOULD BE SAYING NO YOU CAN'T RETAIN ANY OF THAT IN PERSON SO THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO USE AS A CONTACT RACINE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IMMEDIATELY- AND TO GET THAT INFORMATION- SO. THAT'S WITH THE IMMEDIACY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS YOU KNOW A YEAR LATER- MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS IMPORTANT FOR TRYING TO STOP COMMUNICABLE. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. RIGHT OBVIOUSLY YOU ONLY NEED IT FOR THE THAT IMMEDIATE PURPOSE SO AFTER THAT AMOUNT OF TIME SIXTY DAYS. JUST GET RID OF ALL THE INFORMATION. YEAH THAT THE CONCEPT YEAH UNLESS IT'S IN THE POSSESSION- TO IT TO MR GABRIEL'S POINT OF THE STATE OR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHICH WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF THERE'S SOME LONGER TERM HEALTH RELATED ISSUE AND I MEAN THAT DOES SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME- THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION I THINK IS ANOTHER CONCERN IS. YEAH I MEAN IS THAT GOING TO LEAD TO YOU KNOW FOR THE LAWSUITS YOU KNOW THE MAY PEOPLE DISABLE I DON'T WANT THE LIABILITY IF YOU'VE BEEN HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS SO MAYBE IT DISCOURAGES CONTACT TRACING. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T. I DON'T- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD IT- THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THINGS PROPERLY NOT TO. NOT TO GET A WINDFALL RIGHT SO THERE'S ONLY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NO ONE'S GETTING DAMAGES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU WANT TO STOP THE BAD BEHAVIOR- AND THAT THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY PURPOSE THAT WE HAVE THERE OTHERWISE THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- IS IT CLEAR THERE'D ONLY BE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. SO NO MONETARY DAMAGES RIGHT YOU KNOW SOMEONE CAN BRING AN ACTION FOR MONETARY DAMAGES OVER THIS THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE THANK YOU. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK AT THE U. POINTED OUT YOU AND I KIND OF STARTED. ON THIS TOPIC YOU KNOW ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO AND- SO I I'M I'M GLAD YOU'RE CONTINUING TO PUSH AT THE FORT AND- I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OP OPPOSITION AS WELL. SOME OF THEM COULD BE FIXED EASILY RELATIVELY SPEAKING I THINK YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE CALLOW YOUR SITUATION- COULD BE EASILY- I GUESS FIXED- IF WE HAD RECEIVED THE OPPOSITION EARLIER THAN ON WHO COULD AFFECT HIM TOO SO. SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AS WELL- SO I WHICH IS I THINK IT WAS A MOTION. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A SECOND THERE WAS A MOTION AS A SECOND. AND SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS AB EIGHT ONE FOR THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

FOR BOTH BUSINESSES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES GENETIC INFORMATION IS OUR MOST PERSONAL INFORMATION IT IS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE THIS SENSITIVE INFORMATION IT IN THE WRONG HANDS RISKS FAR MORE THAN IMPACTING OUR CREDIT SCORE IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR HEALTH PRIVACY MAKE US SUSCEPTIBLE TO GENETIC GENETIC DISCRIMINATION AND SUBJECT US TO A NEW GENERATION OF IDENTITY THEFT AT THE HANDS OF GENETIC DATA THIEVES AS LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN DNA TESTING SERVICE VITA VITA JEAN INK LEFT THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS GENETIC RECORDS EXPOSED ONLINE FOR YEARS.

LAST LATE LAST YEAR G. E. D. MATCH. WAS HACKED REASON A HOST OF CONCERNS ABOUT REACHES OF THE GENETIC DATA IN THISCASE HACKERS CHANGE THE SETTINGS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPTED NOT TO SHARE THEIR GENETIC INFORMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ALLOW THEIR INFORMATION TO BE SHARED. WITH SO MUCH PERSONAL DATA AT RISK CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO MORE. TO PROTECT CONNECTICUT DATA FROM A DATA BREACH AND BE INFORMED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR GENETIC INFORMATION. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT FIND OUT THEIR GENETIC DATA WAS BREACHED FROM A REPORTER.

THE STATE ALSO REVEALED INFORMATION ABOUT BLOOD RELATIVES WHO MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT THE CONSUMER SURE THE GENOME WITH THE DOCTOR CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANY. WHICH MAKES A PARTICULAR DESERVING OF PROTECTION FROM HACKERS. ASIDE FROM THE INHERENT PRIVACY INTEREST IN KEEPING THIS INFORMATION SECURE.

THIS IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ARE SEPARATELY DEFINED IN THE CODE SECTION THUS CREATING A DEFINITION FOR A NEW TERM THAT INCLUDES DATABASE SEPARATELY DEFINED IN THE LAW WOULD CAUSE CONFUSION WITH REGARDS INTERPRETATION ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE AND ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS AND STATUTE AGAIN WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL AND WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED CREATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THE NEXT SPEAKERS.

AND SLASH WEBPAGES MENTIONED. BY CREATING THAT DEFINITION. FOR A NEW TERM CLOSE TO DATA IS SEPARATE DEFINED IN THE LOCK. IT WOULD CAUSE CONFUSION WITH REGARDS INTERPRETATION FORSMAN AND COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SCOPING AN APPROPRIATE. CONTACT TRACING TESTING THAT THERE ARE SOME KOBE TEST THAT ANALYZED RNA- SIGNED WITH THE VIRUS AND VIRUS IMMUNITY. AB EIGHTEEN FIVE DEFINITION OF GENETIC DATA INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF A TEST RIDE FROM GENETIC MATERIAL. I G. A. CULVER NINETEEN ANTIBODY TEST THIS DEFINITION COULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY FOR BUSINESSES TO CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING. LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR VETOED SB NINE EIGHTY. SENATOR AMBER WITH CONSERVATIVE AN OVERLY BROAD GENETIC DATA DEFINITION THAT CAN BE PAYING KOBE TESTING. MEDICINE THE RECENT CAL OSHA EMERGENCY REGULATIONS REQUIRES MOST CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE COVER TESTING EMPLOYEES. CONSEQUENTLY AB EIGHT TO FIVE CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY DAMAGES WITH NO PROOF OF ENTRY FOR DISCLOSURE TEST RESULTS DERIVED. FROM GENETIC INFORMATION. YOU CAN PLEASE TELL PEOPLE THE RESULT TO THEIR COVER TAX WHICH THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO. COMPANIES CAN BE SUED FOR EACH OF THESE DISCLOSURES WITH NO PROOF OF INJURY WITH SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY DAMAGES IF I COULD. ASK YOU TO REVEREND IS REASONABLE.

THANK YOU AT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT AT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS WOULD STRIKE AT THE COUNTY'S COMPONENTS IN THE SPELL WHEN IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON NOT THAT AMENDMENT AND ON THE BILL MORE BROADLY. AT MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB ONE TEN WHICH REQUIRES CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO CROSS CHECK INCARCERATION RECORDS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT PAIN FRAUDULENT BENEFITS. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE ALONG WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE WATCHED WITH SHOCK AND OUTRAGE THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS FAILED TO CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT HAS ASKED WONDER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CAUSED HEARTACHE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF THE DEPARTMENT'S FAILINGS CAME IN THE FOM OF THE FRAUDULENT PAYMENT OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CLAIMS TO. INCARCERATED INMATES A RECENT STATE AUDIT REPORT NOTED THAT EDT LEFT ITSELF ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO YOU I FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AT WHICH IT ESTIMATES NOW TO HAVE REACHED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BY THE DEPARTMENT LEFT ITSELF VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE A SYSTEM TO REGULARLY CROSS MATCH YOU AYE CLAIMS WITH INFORMATION. FROM CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AB ONE TEN ADDRESSES THIS CRITICAL GAP AND WILL ENSURE THAT EDT CROSS CHECKS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST INCARCERATION DATA I THIS IS A SIMPLE COMMONSENSE STEPS TO PREVENT FRAUD AND- WITH THAT I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE FOR TESTIMONY THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY. FROM ORANGE COUNTY LESLIE YOUNG. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS LESLIE YOUNG ORANGE COUNTY ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CHARGE OF MAJOR FRAUD ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODD SPITZER I STRONGLY URGE IN IDAHO TO ON EIGHTY ONE TEN. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPENCER DIRECTED THE MAJORITY OF OUR FRAUD UNITS RESOURCES. BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BY INMATES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. OUR OFFICE UNCOVERED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PAID TO THE INMATES COCONSPIRATORS IN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE. WE FILED MULTIPLE FELONY CHARGES AGAINST EIGHT INDIVIDUALS. IN YOUR TEAM BUT DESPITE NUMEROUS BANKS SEARCH WARRANTS AND OTHER INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS. TO FRAUDULENTLY DIVERTED FUNDS HAD VANISHED ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE OBTAINING RESTITUTION ORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE NEEDY. THE REALITY IS THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF THAT MONEY WILL NEVER BE RETURNED TO TAXPAYERS. DURING OUR EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION WE LEARNED THAT THESE EIGHT SUSPECTS ARE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF A RAMPANT STATEWIDE FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS SCHEME INVOLVING STATE PRISONER APPLICANT. HAD A MECHANISM BEEN IN PLACE TO BLOCK THIS MONEY FROM DISTRIBUTION TO INELIGIBLE PRISON INMATES I'M TOLD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFEGUARDED. AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES DEVOTED ELSEWHERE. AB ONE TEN IS A COMMONSENSE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN MINIMIZING THE LOSS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FRAUD. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO HELP OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS. NOT TO ENRICH INCARCERATED CRIMINALS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB ONE TEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY LET'S GO TO A PHONE LINE TO MR OPERATOR WHICH PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR. SUPPORTERS. OF THIS BILL AB ONE TEN.

YES GO AHEAD MISS CARILLO GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL UP TO US I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ISSUES RELATED TO EDT AND WE HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ON HOW WE CAN RESOLVE THIS ISSUE ESPECIALLY RELATED TO A BUDGET TO FOR OVERSIGHT ON EDT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOW COME TO AN AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WILL BE COLLABORATING DATA BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND EIGHTY D. THERE WAS A- QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF IT. AND WHILE THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW CURRENTLY- PROCESSING THAT DATA TOGETHER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVEN'T CODIFIED IN LAW SO THAT NO MATTER WHO IS AT THE TABLE AT THE TIME WHO THE DIRECTOR IS WHO WE ARE WHO'S IN OUR SEATS WHOSE- RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BE A PROCESS VERSUS WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE- BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN THE LOSS OF ALL THOSE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS EDUCATION THEY COULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE THEY COULD HAVE GONE TOWARD. ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR SO MANY HURTING OF CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM- AT ASSIST DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT SIMPLY DON'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER AND THAT WHAT THE PANDEMIC HAS DEFINITELY SHOWN US IS THAT WE NEED TO CRITICALLY INVEST IN BEAN TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT OF OUR DEPARTMENTS TO ONE ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MORE UP TO DATE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT EDT FACES AND THAT IT'S WORKING WITH THAT- AND ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS- AND IT'S CURRENTLY ON A VERY FRAGILE FRAGILE LYING AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOWARDS- IN THE FUTURE- BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS ENSURE THAT AS MORE RELIEF COME TOWARDS. TOWARDS CALIFORNIANS THAT AGENCIES ARE SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER TO AVOID ANY ADDITIONAL FRAUD I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON YOUR BILL I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING PAUL. C. THAT I. MAKE THIS. NET THAT CALIFORNIANS- REALLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THINKING ABOUT. EDT IS A IS A SAFETY NET THAT SHOULD FUNCTION SHOULD WORK. AND THE NOTION THAT THAT THIS TYPE OF FRAUD OCCURRED SIMPLY BECAUSE TO AGENCIES DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. AND DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP PEOPLE. IS ACTUALLY KIND OF MIND BOGGLING. SO THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND CHAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING. THE ISSUES THAT EDT MORE BROADLY. LIKE YOU SAID IT IT HAS BEEN MIND BOGGLING I THINK WE'VE ALL FOUND OURSELVES AS- AS RESIDENTS AS TAXPAYERS AND IS LEGISLATORS. ARRANGED FOR GOOD REASON AND- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE FEELINGS AND THAT THIS. DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. MISTER BENNETT GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU- I WON'T REPEAT ALL OF THE- THE- FOR IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT THE POSITIVES OF THIS BILL AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I DO APPRECIATED IT BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SO MUCH COMMONSENSE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION I'D JUST. AS THE AUTHOR- HAS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND JUST IF YOU COULD EXPRESS THE YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND COMMITMENT TO MAKING SURE THAT HAS THIS INFORMATION TO SHARE THAT THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS ARE OUT THERE. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT SURE BEYOND WHERE IT'S NECESSARY- AND SO I I'M SURE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THAT I JUST WANT TO- TRY TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD THAT THAT DID TAKE. THE CONCERNS- THAT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS MAY BE THE OVERLY BROAD. OR ONCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SENSITIVE TO. YES WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND YES ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT. AS WE ARE SHARING DATA BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FUNCTION THAT WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE AND THAT PROTECTS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. MISSPOKEN PLEASE. M. I WANT TO READ. THAT COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. WHO DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING I THINK THAT IT CANNOT BE. UNDER ESTIMATED WHAT GOOD WE COULD HAVE DONE WITH THIS MONEY THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM CALIFORNIANS AND FROM THE TAXPAYERS AND WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IN THIS SMALL CHANGES THAT YOU'RE MAKING THAT WE WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FRAUDSTERS- IS A- HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION IS KEENLY PAYING ATTENTION TO US KEEPING THAT DATA SECURE AND THAT IS OUR OBLIGATION ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THIS DATA AND KEEP IT SECURE AT EVERY TURN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE ACROSS CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENTS WERE NECESSARY BUT MR WHEN HAD TWO BILLS TODAY FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THAT MAKING SURE THAT DATA IS SECURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. BEYOND JUST YOUR BILL WE NEED TO OWN AND-MAKE SURE WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS SELF I AM EXCITED TO SUPPORT EACH DAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD AS A CO AUTHOR BOOK THANK YOU FOR THAT SUPPORT AND- YES. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I'LL ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TACKLING. OF THIS ISSUE UP.

IDENTITY THEFT MONITORING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE EDT TO REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE EVERY SIX MONTHS INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF OVERPAYMENTS REPAID BENEFITS. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE- PERFORMANCE OF A RISK ASSESSMENT OF ITS DEFERRED WORKLOADS CREATE A PLAN THAT PRIORITIZES. ITS DEFERRED WORKLOADS AND HIRE AND TRAIN STAFF NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN THERE'S- APPROXIMATELY TWELVE- DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE EDT.

ANDI ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY LIKE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN AMID COLD IT TO PROCESS EDT CLAIMS I THINK ALL OF OUR STAFF ESPECIALLY OUR STAFF IN THE DISTRICT HAS BECOME ADDITIONAL EXTENDED STAFF TO EDT AS WE TRY TO PROCESS CLAIMS AND HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE- INCREDIBLY HURTING RIGHT NOW- THE AUDIT REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED- RECENTLY AS WELL AS THE AUDIT REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE PAST. HAVE REALLY SHOWN US THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH EDT IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING AN AGENCY IN A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR PEOPLE AS A SAFETY NET- I HAVE A WAS TALKING TO SOME FOLKS WHO SAID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU NEED TO REPAIR YOUR ROOF. YOU DON'T REPAIR YOUR ROOF WHEN IT'S RAINING. HI TO REPAIR YOUR ROOF WHEN. IT'S A SUNNY DAY OUT AND YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND. PLACES THAT THAT NEEDREPAIR BUT WHILE IT'S RAINING AND YOUR LIVING ROOM IS. LEAKING WATER YOU TRY TO PATCH THINGS UP SO THAT AT LEAST YOU TRY TO. PROTECT WHAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE AND WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE. WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS WITHIN EIGHTY D. ARTWORK. WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS NEED TO BE UPDATED WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE ANTIQUATED. IN THE MEANTIME WELL WE GET TO A BETTER PLACE. AFTER COBIT AND COVERT RECOVERY EFFORTS. WE CAN FIND THAT BALANCE AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND SEEM LIKE WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T HOW DO WE IMPROVE IT. WE SHOULD NOT BE IN THE SITUATION AGAIN WE SHOULD HEED. THE ADVICE OF THE AUDIT AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING. THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL CREATE A RESPONSIBLE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ULTIMATELY. TRY TO FIX THE SAFETY NET THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT. SO I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU NINTH PRECIADO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND THE SUB COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WE HELD SOME OF THOSE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND- AND LIKE YOU SAID THE AUDIT ACTUALLY- CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT. DURING THE LAST RAINSTORM THEY DID IT THEY JUST PASSED IT BUT THEY DIDN'T FIX IT. AND SO THIS AUDIT IN THIS BILL NOW WILL PUT THE STRENGTH OF THAT ONLY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT PUT IT IN STATUTES SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT HE- DOES DO THAT SO THAT WE ARE FIXING THAT ROOF. OKAY AND CRAP PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU MISTER SALAS FOR THIS BILL I THINK- IT'S INCREDIBLE WE NEED A BILL TO TELL THEM. SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE DOWN SEND OUT PEOPLE'S ALSO STREAMING. NUMBERS IN THE MAIL BUT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE SO I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT- AND I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE OF YOU AS CHAIR OF. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE USING THE POWER ARE CREDIBLE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THIS WHAT ARE THE STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE AND THEN TAKING ACTION I. SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST UP ALTHOUGH I WOULD ECHO. MY COLLEAGUE THAT WHEN WE MAKE IT THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE SOON. THAT WE DO THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SET UP TO SUCCEED FOR CALIFORNIANS. ONE OF OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES IS TO TAKE CARE OF CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY NEED US MOST AND WE HAVE FAILED THEM THIS LAST YEAR. WHEN IT CAME TO GETTING THE UNEMPLOYMENT THEY HAD PAID INTO. THEIR MONEY THAT THEY DESERVED AND WE WERE NOT GIVING IT TO THEM AND WE KNOW PEOPLE LAS ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD BECAUSE OF IT. AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE OVERSTAFFED AND I WOULD HAVE TO BE. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ABSOLUTELY.

THIS IS A FIFTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO INSURANCE COMMITTEE. CHAP HI CHECK OUT I KILEY. KILEY AYE PARA QUE HAN. OUR QUE HAN AYE BENNETT. BENNETT I CARILLO. WELL I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I. GABRIEL GALLAGHER- WHEN LATE WICKS YOU HAVE SIX VOTES OUT OF THE BILL IS OUT CAN LEAD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH RIGHT I THINK- YES SHE YES YOU WILL.

OTHER AUTHOR- AT THIS TIME I AM GOING TO TAKE THE PRIVILEGE OF PRESENTING- MY BILLS AND ALL LIKE TO GET HAND OVER THE GAVEL TO THE VICE CHAIR KILEY LET ME GET MY STUFF- YEAH ARE YOU HOW THE FIRST. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW WITH THIS IS. SO YOU GOT TOGETHER THE NEED TO. THIS PART OF THE JOB YOU KNOW I DO INTEND WHICH IS PRESENTLY. OKAY AS WE HAVEN'T. WE'LL NOW HEAR A AB THIRTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTEEN WOULD SET FOR OF CRITERIA FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF HIGH RISK AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF ADVERSE AND DISCRIMINATORY IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THEIR DESIGN. AND APPLICATION. THE USE OF AUGUR THEM DRIVEN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS OR SIMPLY ADS CAN ASSIST WITH CREDIT DECISIONS EMPLOYMENT SCREENING INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY MARKETING AND DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW. IN FACT WITHIN THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND MEET THE NEEDS OF CITIZENS IN NEW WAYS IS THE REASON WHY GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING TO CAPTURE THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY THE SYSTEMS. HOWEVER POORLY DESIGNED A DS'S CAN ALSO CREATE UNFAIR BIASED AND INACCURATE RESULTS CAUSING DISPROPORTIONATE HARM TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHILE ALSO UNDERMINING TRUST IN PUBLIC SECTOR. THEREFORE WHEN IT COMES TO ACQUISITION OF THE SYSTEMS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE MUST EXAMINE THE STATE'S PROCUREMENT POLICIES. AS INDICATED BY RECENT STUDIES GOVERNMENT ENTITIES NEED TO CONSIDER IMPORTANT POLICY CHOICES INHERENT IN MACHINE LEARNING. INSTEAD OF TREATING PURCHASES AS NORMAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING DECISIONS WHICH SOLELY FOCUS ON PRICE FAIRNESS IN THE BIDDING PROCESS INNOVATION AND COMPETITION. AS OPPOSED TO GOALS VALUES RISK AND UNCERTAINTY ON FUTURE AGENCY DISCRETION. OTHERWISE GOVERNMENTS COULD FAIL IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS OF OVERSIGHT OF AGREEMENT TAKE. DECISION MAKING AND MAY INNER CAN EMERGE ONLY CREATE NEW RISKS OR HARMS. LET ME SHARE SOME EXAMPLES WHERE PUBLIC SECTOR OUGHT I GREW THEM SYSTEMS HEALTH CAUSE HARM TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN MICHIGAN AND UNEMPLOYMENT AUGUR THEM WRONGFULLY ACCUSED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OF FRAUD. FORCING MANY OF THEM TO PAY HEAVY FINES DECLARE BANKRUPTCY OR HAVE THEIR HOMES FORECLOSED UPON. IN ARKANSAS MEDICAID RECIPIENTS LOST ACCESS TO HOME CARE NURSING VISITS AND MEDICAL TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN. AN IN AN INADEQUACY IN ACCURACIES IN AN ALGORITHM. IN DETROIT A MARKET ANALYSIS ORDER THEM USED TO DIRECT PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND TAX BREAKS IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REDIRECTED CRITICAL FUNDING AWAY FROM DETROIT'S POOREST AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS. ADDITIONALLY THE ACCELERATED INTEREST OF INCORPORATING ADS TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY AS A MEANS TO ADDRESSED AND RECOVER FROM THE CULVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC PROVIDES A NUMBER OF COMPELLING SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS LIKELY TO BE USE. FOR EXAMPLE ALLOCATION OF VACCINES. SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH CLEAR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAIN IT ABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE A PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTOR. TO SUBMIT AN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM IMPACT ASSESSMENT OR SIMPLY A. I. A. TO EVALUATE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND RISKS THAT MAY RESULT IN AN ACT OF INADEQUATE DOUBT. AND ALSO UNFAIR BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DECISION IMPACTING INDIVIDUALS. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE STATE AGENCY TO PRODUCE AN ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT WHICH INCLUDES A DETAILED MITIGATION PLAN FOR IDENTIFYING AND MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY A DISPARATE UP IMPACTS AND THE CD T. WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WOULD MAKE BOTH THE ASSESSMENT. AND THE REPORT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ONLINE THAT WAS NOTED BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE LATITUDE OF USING. INSCRUTABLE BLACK BOX ALGORITHMS THAT INCREASINGLY CHARACTERIZED AGRI THEM'S DEPLOYED IN THE MARKETPLACE. GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS DID NOT CREATE NEW HARMS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK THE LEGAL RIGHTS. HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS OR OTHERWISE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN. INACCURATE UNFAIR BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU I OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR SERRA ARE JORDAN- WITH THE FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES I CAN YES THANK YOU. RIGHT I'M NOT A THIRD PARTY FROM THE FUTURE PRIVATELY FORUMS AT THE END OF THE NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO OUR MISSION TO ADVANCE PRINCIPLE DATA PRACTICES IN SUPPORT OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE UP LOADED WITH THE MOST WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO THE PORTAL BUT I WILL BRIEFLY AT. THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO EIGHTY THIRTEEN ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THE PREVIOUS FIRST AT FIRST WE COMMEND THE FATHERS FOR CRAFTING AN AMENDED DEFINITION OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY AN AUTOMATED. SECOND THE GOVERNMENT CONTACT STAGE IS THE APPROPRIATE STAGE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF ALGORITHMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT A. I. A.'S. WELL HI RICK APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING. THIS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TO EVALUATE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT IS IMPLEMENTED USING TRANSPARENT AND ACTIONABLE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA. AT PF IS AVAILABLE AND DO THE AFFECT TO BE A REPORTS OF FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT ARE A SECOND WITH THIS IS- VINCENT LAY WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS VINCENT. THE MONEY TO DO WHAT MY JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT TECHNOLOGY WORKS TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND BUILD ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THE USE OF A. I. IN GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY ACCELERATING. YEAH ONLY THE GOVERNMENT IT'S UP TO THE TASK OF MANAGING A- THEY'RE PICKING UP ON SOMETHING MENTIONED HERE TODAY. BUT THE DISTINCT LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN THE GOVERNMENT. ESPECIALLY OVER THE SYSTEMS. IF HE DOESN'T ACT. YOU CAN TAKE WHAT HAPPENED AT MICHIGAN. AT THE CHAIR STATED OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WRONGLY ACCUSED OF UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD- BY SYSTEMATIC COST MICHIGAN FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. THE HEAD OF THE AGENCY WAS FIRED MILLION TO RETURN TO THE FACT THAT. IT WAS NO PROPER PROCESS TO APPEAL THOSE DECISIONS AND DO IT ALL THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS THE AGENCY IN CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING THE ALGORITHM. AT LITTLE OR NO IDEA OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND WHAT EXACTLY WENT WRONG. IMPACT ASSESSMENT WOULD HELP PREVENT THIS OUTCOME. IT WOULD HELP THOSE IN CHARGE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY MILLION DOLLARS SYSTEM WORKED. I WOULD HAVE TOLD THE AGENCY WHETHER THE DEVELOPER HAD DONE ANY TESTS RENDON ACTRESS YOU ON THIS. I WOULD TOLD CUSTOMERS IMPACTED HOW THEY COULD APPEAL THOSE DECISIONS. THEY SHOWS WHY WE NEED AB THIRTEEN AND ALGORITHMIC ACCOUNTABILITY. I WON AND I NOTING THAT. AB THIRTY IS VERY MUCH LIKE TENTS READING LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION OF ADS THAT ONLY APPLIES TO THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT. AND INSTANCES WHERE RISK TO CALIFORNIANS IS HIGH. ENOUGH THAT DEVELOPERS PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW HOW THEIR SYSTEM WORKS IT THINK THROUGH. WHETHER THEY'RE A I CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HOW TO MINIMIZE THOSE RISKS AND A DOCUMENT THAT PROCESS. SIMPLY PUT. THE THING THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING ANYWAYS. AND FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY. ASK ME ABOUT. THANK YOU. OF THE COULD PLEASE OPEN PHONE LINE FOR- MEMBER OF THE- WHO WISH TO TESTIFY I SUPPORT. ABSOLUTELY IN LADEN JOHN ON THE PHONE LINE IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN ONE ZERO IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE OF THREE IN OUR QUEUE. HOW WILL FIRST GO TO NUMBER FORTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THANK YOU THIS IS TRACY ROSENBERG CALLING ON BEHALF OF OAKLAND PRIVACY. IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN. THE NEXT TO GO TO LINE NINETY NINETY PLEASE GO AHEAD. ADVOCATE AFTERNOON REBECCA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS HANNAH HOW I WOULD TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE IN STRONG SUPPORT. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. WE HAVE ONE WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION- AND THAT IS CHAU MUHAMMAD WITH CALCHAMBER. THANK YOU ARE NOT SURE MEMBERS MANAGE WHAT MUHAMMAD THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL IS DRAFTED I AB THIRTEEN ALLOWS LOCAL AGENCIES TO REQUEST DETAILED IMPACT ASSESSMENTS FROM BUSINESS ANOTHER PREREQUISITE TO APPLYING FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS. IT IMPACT ASSESSMENTS REALLY AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS OR ADAS BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM AB THIRTEEN THERE'S BEEN OVER BROADENS DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE DEFINITION OF AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM OR ATS IS DEFINED AS ANY COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS THAT ISSUES THE SCORE CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION RATHER SIMPLE FIND OUT BUT THAT IS USED TO SUPPORT HUMAN DECISION MAKING AND MATERIAL IMPACTS PERSONS. THE TECHNICIAN WAS BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE VIRTUALLY ALL FORMS OF COMPUTING EVEN SIMPLE PROGRAMS THAT THAT FOLKS USE EVERY DAY SIMILARLY THE DEFINITION OF HIGH RISK APPLICATION IS NOT ACTUALLY COMBINED HIGH RISK APPLICATION BUT INCLUDES ALMOST ANY USED TO THE IDEA THANK TENSELY RESULT IN INACCURATE UNFAIR BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS. IMPACTING PERSONS BUT IT CAN BE SAID THAT EVERY COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE pRESULT IN AN ACCURACY THAT'S MAKING DOESN'T OVER BROAD STANDARD TO APPLY THE DEFINITION OF HIGH RISK APPLICATION ALSO INCLUDES AN EIGHTY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF A- QUOTE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF INDIVIDUALS BUT AGAIN DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER IS NOT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IS OVERBROAD DEFINITION STRIKE CONCERN FOR US IS AB THIRTEEN DOES NOT PROVIDE EXPLICIT PROTECTIONS FOR PROTECT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION- WHEN ELECTORAL PROPERTY MANY BUSINESSES ARE CONCERNED A LOCAL AGENCY COULD REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO REAL. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES AS A PREREQUISITE FOR APPLYING FOR A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY NOT ONLY IS THIS A CONCERN FOR BUSINESSES WHO ARE NATURALLY PROTECTIVE OF SUCH INFORMATION BUT THERE'S ALSO CONCERN THAT. OFFICE DATA IN ONE PLACE MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT SUCH INFORMATION FROM BAD ACTORS FINALLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB THIRTEEN ALLOW AGENCIES TO REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO CONDUCT. IMPACT ASSESSMENT AS PREREQUISITES NAME BADGE AND THESE ADDITIONAL PROCESSES REQUIRED GET. CITING THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF THAT PER CONTRACT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO OR OTHERWISE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO JUMP THROUGH THE HURDLES IN ADVANCE OF A PLANNED FOR CONTRACT WILL BE LEFT UNABLE TO COMPETE FOR THE SAME. ACCORDINGLY WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN IS DRAFTED WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU- MODERATE CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO SHOULD TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. ABSOLUTELY JOHN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. JENNIFER OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS. ONE ZERO. DOES LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN IN OUR QUEUE. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND WE'LL START WITH NUMBER EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. BUT AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS NAMELY THE DRONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE AND ALSO THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES INTERFAX OPPOSITION TO AB.

GOOD AFTERNOON NOT ONLINE ON BEHALF OF TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB. THIRTY ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS. ONE ZERO. THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLY WOMAN TARA OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER ASHER. I AM SO I JUST LOOKED AT. I RESHAPE WE'RE DOING HERE MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WORK BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THESE DECISIONS SYSTEMS ARE. AND HURRIEDLY AND HARLEY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE PROBLEMATIC- WHEN IT COMES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE SUFFERED. AB AND WE NEED TO WORK TO CORRECT THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE WORK WE DO AS A STATE. SO I THINK THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT I DO HOWEVER SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THIS BILL- YOU KNOW HIGH RISK APPLICATION SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY LIMITED UNTIL YOU READ THE DEFINITION INCLUDES EVERYTHING THAT AFFECTS THE LEGAL RIGHTS. HEALTH AND WELL BEING. HAVE A NATURAL PERSON WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS EVERYTHING WE DO IS A STATE- I MEAN IF WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS NATURAL PEOPLE THEN I DON'T NOTICE WE DO EVERY DAY SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THE HIGHER RISK APPLICATION DEFINITION LIMITS IT AND SO THEN I LOOK TO THE AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM AND IT DOES SEEM INCREDIBLY BROAD IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH. COMMITTEE IT APPEARED AT THAT THE ATTEMPT TO NARROW IT WAS DONE THROUGH THIS- MODIFIER OF OR OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT WHICH NOT BEING A TAX EXPERT TECH EXPERT AND TO BE HONEST AT THIS MOMENT I MISSING OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE JAY OBERNOLTE WHO I KNOW WOULD HAVE LOTS OF THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL- BUT- YOU KNOW. I READ THAT TO BE A FOURTH OPTION SO COULD BE A SCORE CLASS CATION RECOGNITION OR OTHER SIMPLE FIND OUT PUT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO MODIFY THE LIST SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO CHANGES TO NARROW IT SO IT ISN'T EVERY SINGLE COMPUTER APPLICATION THAT WE USE IS A STATE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT. I MEAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I DON'T THINK THAT IS YOUR INTENT NOR DO I THINK THAT'S NECESSARY I DO THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM HERE. AND THE MORE WE CAN NARROW IT THE BETTER IT WILL BE SO CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT AND- YOU KNOW LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT DEFINITION IN HOPES OF NARROWING IT. THANK YOU FOR VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION MAYBE BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. OF THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND WHEN WE INTRODUCED IT THE OPPOSITION REYES VERY SIMILAR CONCERNS OR IF NOT IDENTICL CONCERNS. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE MAIN MAIN. CONCERN WAS THAT THE PRESS OF THE TO THE DEFINITIONS. AND SO WE REACHED OUT TO THE OPPOSITION AND TRY TO KIND OF. FIND OUT OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND YOU KNOW. WHATEVER INPUT THEY MIGHT HOUSE SO THAT WE COULD KINDA USED TO NARROW THE- SCOPE OF THE BILL. AFTER WAITING A YEAR OR SO- AND RECEIVING NO INPUT FROM THEM. WE TOOK IT UPON US OURSELVES TO. START TO AYE WE STARTED NARAL THE BILL SUBSTANTIALLY. SO CURRENTLY- THE BILL ONLY PERTAINS TO ATS IS. THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT- APPLY TO HIGH RISK APPLICATIONS- WHICH ARE FURTHER DEFINED IN THE BILL ITSELF. AS MEETING ONE OF THE THREE CRITERIA AND I COULD SPELL. IT ALL OUT IF YOU WANT. BUT THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DONE IN ADDITION. THE LANGUAGE NOW PROVIDES FOR- THE C. T. WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALSO. FURTHER PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES AND TELL YOU KNOW TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD. WHAT OTHER APPLICATIONS ARE SUBJECT. TO THIS THIS LAW. SO IT IS NT REALLY. YOU KNOW TO OVERRIDE IT IN THAT REGARD. AND I THINK THE TERM HIGH RISK IS YOU KNOW DEFINE. IN VERY MINUTE TERMS- SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION. BUT I THINK IF THE CONCERN IS WHETHER OR NOT. THE DEFINITION WORKED OUT YOU KNOW SWEEP UP THINGS LIKE COMPUTERS OR OR OR- CALCULATORS AND SPREADSHEETS. I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE WILL DO GOING FORWARD IS TO PROBABLY. ALL AMENDED THE BILL TO EXPLICITLY EXT EXCLUDE THOSE SELL ITEMS FROM FROM THE BILL. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT INTENT RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE NOT WE DON'T INTEND TO GO TO INCLUDE EVERY SINGLE- CALCULATOR OUT THERE I MEAN THAT MAKES NO SENSE. AND I THINK THE WORK THAT THE BUZZWORD THEIR DATE THAT THE KEY WORD THERE IS A MATERIAL I THINK. SO CALCULATORS DO NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT YOU KNOW HUMANIZE IT. SO BUT I THINK IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK WILL WILLING TO DO THAT AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO YOURSELF. AND THE LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE USING. IS TAKEN ACTUALLY FROM A VERY SO. LET'S SAY THE FOR THE FOR- THERE WAS A LOT OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION- THAT- WE KIND OF BORROWED SOME LANGUAGE FROM. SO WE WILL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT- JUST TO KIND OF CLEAR THE AIR AND WE DON'T. INTEND TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THOSE. BUT UP I THINK THE ARE THE SPONSOR HAS- YOU KNOW HAS SOME INSIGHTS AND PERHAPS MORE EXPERTISE. IF I COULD- TURN TO THE SPONSOR FOR ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON MISTER CHAIR- MR REALLY QUICKLY- FROM. THREE NINE YES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU- YES COULD NOT. I SAVE YOU KNOW THE SIMILAR. PRESIDENT AND BOTH THE EUROPEAN UNION AD CANNOT AND IN REQUIRE. IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND- I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE CANADA DEFINITION OF AN EIGHTY YES. TECHNOLOGY REPLACES THE JUDGMENT OF HUMAN DECISION MAKERS SO IN COMPARISON TO THAT- ARE- YOU KNOW LANGUAGE IS MUCH MORE NARROWED- IN THE E. U. IT'S JUST DATA PROCESS IT MEANS. DATA OR SAT THAT'S NOT FAIR- YOU KNOW IN IN THAT CONTEXT. AB THIRTEEN IS ACTUALLY VERY MORE VERY MUCH MORE SPECIFIC AND- I WOULD ACTUALLY ALSO DEFERRED A DOCTORS ARE JORDAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE. AT EASE I HEAD INTO YOU KNOW WHAT THE SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT AND HOW THAT CAN HELP NARROW- THE APPLICATION OF THIS DEFINITION. I YES IS THE OTHER WITNESS WANNA. PROCEED. WELL NOT NOT HEARING- CHERUB SO I'LL JUST THAT KIND OF SAY THAT THE ANALYSIS FROM THE FROM THE COMMITTEE COVERED THAT SITUATION PRETTY WELL EIGHT EIGHT SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT MEANS THE DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION MEANS TAKING A LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES- AND THEN COME COME COLLAPSING BACK INTO ONE PARTICULAR VARIABLE BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING A CALCULATOR DOES AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY ADDING THE SAME VARIABLE YACHTING I NUMBER PLUS THE NUMBER BUT THE NUMBER THAT'S NOT A DIMENSIONAL REDUCTIONS. THIS DEFINITION WAS TALK TO WITH A LOT OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND DATA SCIENTISTS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE AND- YOU KNOW AS THE AUTHORS STATED WHERE WE'RE WILLING TO WORK- WE JUST NEED SOME HELP FROM- THE OPPOSITION THAT THE HELP NARROW THAT. I THINK YOU AND I AM NOT THE OPPOSITION BUT- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT AND I THINK THAT MY- CONCERN IS ACTUALLY STATUTORY INTERPRETATION WHICH IS. THAT I DIDN'T READ THAT TO SAY THAT THE OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT MEANT THE SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT APPLIED TO SCORE CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION. TO ME THAT WAS A LIST AND OTHER SOME OF APPLE WAS A FOURTH. ELEMENT AND SO I THINK IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE IS LIMITED. TO EVERYTHING THAT PROVIDES A SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT IT JUST NEEDS TO BE RE DRAFTED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT MY READING IS THAT. THE LEGISLATION BUT I THINK IT DOES HELP TO CLARIFY AND I THINK WE CAN. IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED FIX. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. ABSOLUTELY. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MISTER JENNER I APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THE CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS- IS WILLING TO WORK TO TRY TO GET THAT CLARIFICATION JUST IT IT IS A COMPLICATED BILL FOR ARC FOR NONTECHNICAL PEOPLE AND TERMS OF- READING AND UNDERSTANDING SO APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. YEAH SO WHAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT ON THIS IS YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF- ZERO OF HAVING TO PROVIDE YOUR ALGORITHM TO. TO GOVERNMENTS AND MANY OTHER PRIVATE INDUSTRIES THINKING THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THEIR- YOU KNOW THEIR TRADE SECRETS THERE- YOU KNOW BUSINESS SECRETS TO PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND I MEAN DOES THE BILL DO THAT OR THEY BE REQUIRED TO KIND OF GIVE THEIR PRIVATE ALGORITHM. AND THEY'RE GONNA AND- CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. NO WE WILL NOT- REQUIRED THAT IN FACT THE RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS- MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT- WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR TRADE SECRETS OR ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION- SO THEY ARE NOT. FOR EXAMPLE SEE THE T. R. WHO SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED SHOULD NOT ACTUALLY A PUBLISH ANY OF THE TRADE SECRETS OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. OF THAT WOULD BE DEEMED OF PROPRIETARY SO THAT'S IN INDIA AGAIN AND SO. I WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION BUT IS IT'S IN THE CURRENT VERSION. OKAY- AND THEN I MEAN. I GUESS ONE OF THE ISSUES IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GET AT. MAY NECESSARILY THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO- HOW MANY NINE KEY WORDS IN THERE AND THEY'RE CREATED BY HUMAN BEINGS SO THEY'RE ALL TO MANY GONNA HAVE ISSUES WITH THEM BUT THE IDEA BEING THAT THEY KIND OF HELP CREATE EFFICIENCIES- I MEAN CAN YOU REALLY CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECTLY. A PERFECTLY AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM- WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT- IS GALLAGHER I THINK I WOULD I TRYING TO CREATE A PERFECT SYSTEM- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS SOMEWHAT BIASED IN A WAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE ALGORITHMS ON THESE BLACK BOXES WHICH HAVE BEEN COLLABORATED THROUGHOUT THAT YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND OF THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THESE BLACK BOXES DO WIN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF DATA GOES INTO THE SYSTEM AND WHAT COMES OUT I MEAN WEEK SOMETIMES WE KNOW WHAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW WHAT COMES OUT OF IT- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE COULD USE UP. OUR FLIGHT RISKS- AND LET'S SEE OF THE PREVIOUS CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THEY USE THAT INFORMATION AND DAHLE YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME COULD BE- BILL AMOUNT FOR EXAMPLE SO BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BLACK BOXES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MECHANISM WHAT THEOTHER THING IS THAT THAT MAKES THAT DECISION FOR PEOPLE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO FOR TOO LONG I THINK WE'VE BEEN- ALLOWING- YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMS TO PROLIFERATE OUT THERE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT BUT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO IN FACT. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WITH THAT WE CITED THREE EXAMPLES IN MY OPENING AND YOU KNOW FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S INFORMATION- YOU KNOW- THAT WAS USED- IN FACT A FRAUDULENT YOU WRONGFULLY USED IN AND THEY WERE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING FRAUD AND ON APPEAL ONLY 8% OF THOSE CASES ARE TURNED OUT TO BE VALID SO THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND UP PEOPLE'S CASES WERE INVALID BECAUSE OF THE USE OF WRONGFUL AUGUR THEM AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE AUTHOR WITHIN LESS THAN YOU KNOW EXCEPT FOR THE YOU HAVE DEVELOPER OR THE PEOPLE USING AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT. SO WE YOU KNOW ALL WE WANT TO DO NOW IS TO IS TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THAT BLACK BOX ON THOSE ALTERNATIVES THAT PEOPLE USE THESE DAYS AND WE'RE LIMITING IT TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHO USE THESE CELL OPERATIVES OR THE CDSS SO IT'S A VERY IN THE NARROW SCOPE IT OUT IN MANY WAYS- WE'RE NOT REQUIRING EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS TO DO- SO WE'RE- LIKE A- YOU KNOW WE ALSO. PROVIDING FOR CD TO PAY- PRESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE- GUIDELINES FOR PEOPLE TO COMPLY WITH. SO THIS IS A VERY NARAL- NARROWLY TAILOR- SOLUTION. TO A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE NOBODY'S BEEN LOOKING OUT OF. BUT I THINK THAT THIS WITNESS ALSO MENTIONED THAT A CANDIDATE IS USING IT- THE YOU IS USING AT THE YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE IN EUROPE ARE USING ITSELF. SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING AT THE ISSUE- TOO CLOSELY NEW YORK HOUSING IT OFF ALL PAST ACTS COMPOSED OF A ATTACK OF TASK FORCES TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE. IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IS DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW- SO. THIS IS NO I THINK YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA. ALL WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AT THIS ISSUE HI COMING I MEAN I COULD NOT SO- IT'S OUT THERE ALREADY YOU KNOW ITS- BEEN WORKING. YOU KNOW WITHOUT BEHIND- SEE YOU. KNOW BEHIND A- BEHIND THE SCENES OF. ANY OTHER COMMENTS- FOR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. SO THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW CUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WE OF THIS COMMITTEE PASSED A RESOLUTION ENDORSING THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES FOR THE SAFE AND BENEFICIAL DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH- YOU KNOW WAS ITSELF- THE PRODUCT OF. THE HUNDREDS OF LEADING RESEARCHERS AND ACADEMICS AND ETHICISTS- IN THE FIELD BUT IN VARIOUS FIELDS- AND THEN IT YOU KNOW THAT RESOLUTION IS NOT UNANIMOUSLY PASSING OUR OUR LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE THE FIRST LEGISLATION THE COUNTRY TO ENDORSE ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES- IN THERE IS THE IDEA OF EXPLAIN ABILITY YOU KNOW THAT- WHAT'S GOING ON SHOULD BE AUDITABLE BY A COMPETENT- HUMAN AUTHORITY AND I UNDERSTAND. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY BE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BILL IS TO GET AT. AT THAT IDEA SO I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- THE- THE OPPOSITION- IF YOU WILL AND DO YOU AGREE THAT. I SHOULD ALSO ADD BY THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A NOTHING OF A CONCERN WHEN WE HAVE THE LIKES OF FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE. THEY'RE USING ALGORITHMS TO SORT OF SHAPE OUR PREFERENCES WHO HAS THAT WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND- BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT DOING THAT- IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER MATTER IT RAISES I THINK- QUESTIONS OF DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THAT THE GOAL OF THIS IS A QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION IS. DO YOU DO YOU AGREE THAT THIS IDEAOF EXPLAINED ABILITY IS. AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE- WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES- AND IF SO HOW COULD THIS BILL BE. MORE NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WITHOUT THAT SORT OF CONCERNS. YOU'RE RAISING ABOUT OVER BREATH. AND THIS IS FOR MR MOHAMMED WITHOUT CALCHAMBER. IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. I AM ON THE LINE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR QUESTION- YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO- AT YOU KNOW ATTEMPTING TO CATER TO AMEND THE BILL TO. PUT IT IN A PLACE WHERE WHERE WE NEED MORE WORKABLE- I THINK AT THIS POINT REALLY COMES DOWN TO- YOU KNOW SURGICALLY DEFINING TERMS LIKE AUTOMATED DISPENSING SYSTEM AND HIGH RISK APPLICATION- ON OUR END- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER- IT WAS A LITTLE TALK TO CRAFT- DEFINITIONS OF COURSE- YOU KNOW BURKE FOR LEGISLATION POLICY THEY'RE PERFECT BUT- WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE HOWEVER- I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE- WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE ON AND- AND I CONTINUE TO ENGAGE JOHN. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION SUFFICIENTLY. I THINK IT DOES AND I THINK THAT- MISTER CHAI YOU CITED A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES AND I THINK THE FEDERAL LAW TRADE COMMISSION IS IT JUST CAME OUT WITH SOME- GUIDELINES AS WELL. IT SORT OF THAT. YOU KNOW DEFINING WHAT CONSTITUTES A AYE VERSUS A STANDARD SORT OF COMPUTATION IS. IS TRICKY I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A NUMBER OF. GUIDEPOSTS OUT THERE THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT CAN BE LOOK TO- DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS- MISTER CHOW AND SORT OF HOW- YOU ENVISION THE BILL MOVING FORWARD TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. YEAH I FORESEE US. DOING A LITTLE CLEAN UP ON THE LANGUAGE ITSELF OFFERS ON PLACE CITED EARLIER. THAT THAT THEY WERE SORTS THAT WE COULD TO- PLAY WITH A LITTLE BIT FOR EXAMPLE I THINK- IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT- THE TERM POTENTIAL COULD. INVITE ADDITIONAL ISSUE SO WE'LL LOOK AT AND- LOOK INTO THAT. AND ALSO- PREVIOUSLY WE DISCUSSED OBVIOUSLY THE- THE DEPRESSING THIS OR THE BRASS- THE- OVER BROUGHT DINOSAUR BREATH OF THE WILD. AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO. AMEND THE BILL TO EXCLUDE THINGS LIKE SPREADSHEETS AND- CALCULATORS AND THE LIKE- BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE WASHINGTON STATE'S BUILT. UP SO WE COULD TO. DO THAT AND- YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT WE JUST LIKE TO INVITE- THE OPPOSITION TO PROVIDE US WITH THE INPUT I THINK YOU KNOW. WE WE'VE BEEN READY AND ABLE AND TRY TO WORK WITH THEM ON ON THE ON A DESTINATION. THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY BUT WE WANT TO YOU KNOW THAT THEIR INTENT I THINK AS I AS I STATED BEFORE. SO WE JUST WANT TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THESE. OTHER ITEMS. AND FROM A GOVERNMENT. ENTITIES PERSPECTIVE. THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHEN THEY EVALUATE THESE UP PROJECTS SUBMITTED BY CONTRACTORS. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT I MEAN IF YOU DON'T. IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THESE BLACK THE BLACK BOXES OF THESE ORGANISMS. HOW WOULD THEY- PICK AND CHOOSE OF SOME YOU KNOW- A PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW I THINK OF FOR TOO LONG WE'LL BE LOOKING AT JUST THINGS LIKE THE COST. AND OTHER THINGS INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM FOR IT FOR EXAMPLE VALUE. STILL UP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A COST WE ALL TO. ALSO LOOK AT THINGS THAT. WE WOULD HAVE- IN CURFEWS ON THE COST IT WOULD HAVE A CO HER. HEAD DOES SOMETHING GONE. FOR EXAMPLE. IN IT'S A GOVERNMENT- GETS THE- YOU KNOW. WHAT KIND OF THE- YOU KNOW LIKE TO MEXICO CASE I. YOU KNOW. WHAT THE DAMAGE DONE IT I MEAN. YOU KNOW I THINK THE COST. FOR ALWAYS ANY ANY POTENTIAL. YOU KNOW SO WE GOT A AT IT FROM THAT. TO STUFF. SO- I THINK THAT THE IDEA IS SIMPLE I MEAN WE DON'T DID YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO. OPERATING ON ANY SYSTEM THAT WOULD CREATE ANY- DISCRIMINATORY OR BIASED. A IMPACT ON ANYBODY IN FACT SO THAT'S THE GOAL. ALL RIGHT WELL I YEAH I AM. YOU KNOW SATISFIED YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON ON THOSE ISSUES TO ASSURE THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO CREATE AN IMPEDIMENT TO- THE USE OF YOU KNOW VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY- IN IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND WON'T DISADVANTAGE- YOU KNOW CERTAIN TYPES OF. OF COMPANIES IN THE BIDDING PROCESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND I KNOW WE'VE WORKED VERY WELL IN THESE THESE ISSUES TOGETHER BEFORE SO- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS DUE PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IS AB UNITED IT HATTIESBURG REACHES OUT HI. I. HAVE HI THE FIVE HOUR YEAH OKAY I RIGHT YEAH I. CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM VOTING GABRIEL AGAU. GALLAGHER NONVOTING IRWIN IRWIN ACT LEE. WICKS. AT THAT BILL HAS SIX PLUS SO THAT IS HOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MEMBERS AND WE HAVE A SECOND BILL FROM- MISTER CHANNEL WHICH IS AB. FOURTEEN NINETY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL KEEP A VERY BRIEF- LAST YEAR THE VOTERS OF- CALIFORNIA PASSED. PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR WHICH CREATED A PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY WITH FIVE MEMBERS TO BE APPOINTED TO THE BOARD- THE LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSITIONS SUGGEST THAT APPOINTEES TO THE BOARD SHOULD. BE SOMEONE WITH EXPERTISE IN PRIVACY TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER RIGHTS. AND IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IT SAYS IT REQUIRES BOARD MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUALIFICATIONS IN AREAS OF PRIVACY AND TECHNOLOGY PERIOD- SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS THAT IT INSERT THE THREE COURTS BACK IN THE- IN IN THE IN THE IN THE LAW AND WHICH IS NOW PART OF CIVIL CODE. OF THE WORD THE THREE WORDS ARE- CONSUMER RIGHTS AND CONSUMER RIGHTS SO THAT IS ESSENTIALLY TO THE BILL- SO- THANKS. MOTIONS IN TWO SECONDS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE YOU ON THAT. OUR FIRST AYE WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF WOULD OF ONE WITNESS- I GUESS ACTUALLY SHOULD OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- IF THERE ARE ANY. FOLKS ON THE LINE. AND LATER JOHN IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. GEN ONE ZERO IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR. THEN THAT WE HAVE- CHAU MUHAMMAD IS OUR WITNESS IN OPPOSITION FROM CALCHAMBER. THANK YOU AGAIN HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS- PARENTS ABOUT MUHAMMAD CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE VERY VERY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL IS DRAFTED AND AS ALWAYS WE REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO'S OFFICE AND THE STAFF. ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL IS THAT THE TERM CONSUMER RIGHTS COULD BE INTERPRETED TO EXCLUDE OTHERWISE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FROM APPLYING TO THE BOARD- AND WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IF THE TURN CONSUMER RIGHTS IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN EXPERIENCE WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS. OR FOR SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS ARE OUR GROUPS ARE POSITIONS MANY OTHERWISE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES COULD BE EXCLUDED FROM CONSIDERATION SO NARROWING THE QUALIFICATIONS IN THIS WAY COULD POTENTIALLY HINDER A DIVERSE INCLUSIVE BOARD OUT OF. DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER OPINION- AND FOR THAT REASON WE MUST THAT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS I CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON ALL OUR BILLS NATIONS THANK. THANK YOU I THERE ANY OF THE PUBLIC ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. AND IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. GEN ONE ZERO CURRENT OPPOSITION- WE WILL FIRST GO TO LINE EDT PLEASE GO AHEAD. I DON'T HAVE TO GO ON OFTEN ON BEHALF OF INTERNET ASSOCIATION RESPECT LIPS THANKS. ONE TENDER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE- PLEASE CONTINUE MR. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE. COUPLE QUESTIONS THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THIS THE LANGUAGE ABOUT EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER RIGHTS EXIST IN ONE PLACE BUT NOT ANOTHER AND YOU'RE SEEKING TO MAKE IT IT'S THAT IS WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHETHER WHAT THAT WAS INTENTIONAL- IS THIS WAS AN OVERSIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE RIGHT I THINK I THINK IT REALLY MAKES SENSE TO ADD THAT FROM BACK IN THERE OR ADDED TO. THE LAW BECAUSE IT- IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE FOR CONSISTENCY OF PURPOSE IS FOR ONE THING AND NUMBER TWO I THINK HAVING THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CONSUMER RIGHTS REALLY. REALLY HELPS. INSTEAD OF HINDER OF THE OF THE PROCESS. FOR MEMBERS YES SO MY VIEW IS TO FOLLOW UP THE QUESTIONS AND ONE WILL BE. WHAT CONSTITUTES EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER RIGHTS. YEAH I THAT ELSEWHERE TO FIND OR OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE CONTEMPLATION- YEAH I THINK THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT IS OUT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE REQUIRING CONSUMER ADVOCACY WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO DO. ALL WE TRYING TO DO IS A SOMEBODY WITH YOUR CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WHICH-COULD BE PICKED UP ANY ANY ANYWHERE. FOR EXAMPLE I THINK- HOUSE AN EXAMPLE HERE- LET'S SEE ACADEMIC STUDY OF CONSUMER RIGHTS ARE YOU KNOW OR EXPERIENCE- HELPING INDUSTRIES NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITY OF COME CONSUMER LAW. SO IT COULD IT'S A VERY BROAD TERMINOLOGY THAT COULD TELL QUALIFY UNDER THE DEFINITION. SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW LIMITING- COULD NOT PRESCRIBING ANY ANY PARTICULAR- ELEMENTS TO THAT TERMINOLOGY. BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT I'M ON THE FENCE ON IT BECAUSE AND FLEW OVER THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I'M STUCK ON THAT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE- LIKE THAT WOULD LIMITED MOSTLY TO PROFESSORS AND LAWYERS. AM I WRONG. I MEAN THAT'S- NO NO IN FACT IT IDEA DIMENSIONS ACADEMIC STUDIES SO THAT DEFINITELY. WOULD INCLUDE PROFESSORS I MEAN THAT. THAT'S A STUDY OF CONSUMER LAW OF COURSE THIS SORRY WHAT WHEN I'M WHEN I'M TRYING TO SAY IS. I THINK IF WE ADD THE TERM IF THE BILL. BECOMES LAW. THE FURTHER. IT'S A FURTHER ADDITIONAL QUALIFIER EIGHT ADMIN AND IT. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MOST LOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM YOU KNOW CONSUMER RIGHTS WOULD BE PROFESSORS. AND ATTORNEYS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER. RIGHTS IN THE SITE. IS THAT THE DIRECTION YOU'RE SEEKING TO GO AND ART AND ARE WE BEING OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE IN THAT IT IS IT IS I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S FROM IS BROAD ENOUGH TO. ENCOMPASS A LOT OF- EXPERIENCES THAT COULD QUALIFY UNDER THAT DEFINITION. SO OKAY AND SO LIKE WHAT WHAT. I APOLOGIZE FOR THINKING OUT LOUD I'M TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THIS. LIKE IT SHOULD BE WORKED AS AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD THAT BE OR SOMEBODY RAN A SMALL BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY- HAD A CREDIT DISPUTE WITH THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY YOU KNOW I MEAN ARE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. WOULD THEY CONSTITUTE THIS TYPE OF CONSUMER RIGHTS EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE IF THE IF THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT THEY'RE- DEALING WITH INVOLVING INVOLVED- CONSUMERS. OKAY ALL RIGHT APPRECIATE YEAH IT'S VERY BROAD I MEAN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO KIND OF LIMIT TO SCHOOL WITH THE DEFINITION. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SINAN MISTER CHALLENGER TO CLOSE- YEAH I AS WE ARE ABLE THANK YOU. OF THE OTHER MOTION SECOND MOTION IS DUE PASS. THIS TO APPROPRIATIONS TO APPROPRIATIONS UP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

DONE THE- I WILL SPEAK QUICKLY- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MOMENTS I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU CAN BE STUFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS LAGUAGE AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE THE KIDS ACT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT CHILDREN WHERE THEY CONSUME ONLINE CONTENT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO THEM THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL CHILDREN'S TELEVISION ACT WHICH REGULATES THE CONTENT THE KIDS CONSUME ON TELEVISION RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING. WELL AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE IS NOT AS PRESCRIPTIVE ITS CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATIONS THE BILL AS IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WILL PROVIDE SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM MANIPULATIVE DESIGN FEATURES THAT PROVIDE INSTANT ACCESS TO INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT OR MARKETING WHILE THEY'RE ONLINE SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT PLATFORMS. PLATFORMS PROVIDE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS WITH THE ABILITY TO OPT INTO DESIGN FEATURES SUCH AS AUTO PLAY AN IN APP PURCHASES TO ENSURE THAT THESE FEATURES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY AVAILABLE FOR CONTENT DIRECTED AT KIDS THIS LAYER OF PROTECTION ALLOW PARENTS TO CONTROL THEIR CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO FEATURES THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR ADULTS AND THEREFORE DO NOT FACTOR IN THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUNG MINDS ABILITIES AND SENSIBILITIES ADDITIONALLY AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE WILL PROHIBIT CONTENT DIRECTED TO KIDS TO PROMOTE APPLE FIVE OR ENCOURAGE CONSUMPTION OF CONTENT OR ADVERTISING THAT INVOLVES SEXUAL MATERIAL PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE INCLUDING BULLYING. ADULT ACTIVITIES OR OTHER CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO FINALLY AS COMPANIES CREATE NEW PLATFORMS AND DIRECT ONLINE CONTENT TO KIDS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH PROTECTIONS SIMILAR TO WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR CHILDREN'S TELEVISION PROGRAMS I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES FORWARD TO REDEFINE THE DEFINITIONS ARE PARTICULAR AND I'VE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF YOU ABOUT THAT AND I'M VERY OPEN TO THINKING THAT THROUGH AND TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUING FURTHER AMENDMENTS- WITH ME I HAVE- VIRTUALLY MY WITNESS- JOSEPH JR MON A DIRECTOR OF PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY INSTEAD ADVOCACY AT COMMON SENSE MEDIA. ON THE LINES TESTIFIED. MISTER DRUMMING BEGIN. Q. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD. BOB SO FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS JOSEPH TROHMAN AND- I DO I WORK ON EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ONLINE PLATFORMS FOR COMMON SENSE MEDIA WE SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE- THE REALITY IS WITH KIDS AND FAMILY SCREEN TIME EXPLODING IN YOU KNOW RESPONSE TO REMOTE LEARNING THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER LARGER TECH TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING- PROMOTING ACCESS TO RESPONSIBLE CHILD APPROPRIATE ONLINE CONTENT THE POTENTIAL. YOUNG KIDS RIGHT NOW ARE AVERAGING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS OF SCREEN TIME PER DAY AND ONLINE VIDEOS FROM STREAMING SERVICES DOMINATE THAT PACIFIC- IN A RECENT CENTER BY MEDIA USUALLY FOUND THAT 44% OF PARENTS REPORT THAT THEIR CHILDREN SPEND TOO MUCH TIME WITH STREAMING MEDIA. NEARLY HALF THE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GET KIDS TO STOP USING- ONLINE PLATFORMS THE REALITY IS THE TECH PLATFORMS ARE ARE RIFE WITH WHAT WE CALL WHAT ARE FORTUNATE PERSUASIVE DESIGN WHICH STEERS USERS TOWARD CERTAIN BEHAVIORS THAT OFTENTIMES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS- WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS LIKE AUTO PLAY- WHICH RESEARCH HAS SHOWN CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO AND- YOU CANNOT. GET OUT OF ON PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE KIDS PRESENTLY AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF MESSAGES THAT- PROVIDE KIDS WITH THAT SCENT OF ARTIFICIAL ACHIEVEMENT OR PROPONENT AND I THINK THESE DESIGN FEATURES COME ON TOP OF LARGER CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON VIDEO STREAMING PLATFORM- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW ALGORITHMS I'M VIDEO STREAMING PLATFORMS. AMPLE BUY EXTREMISM AS WELL AS OTHER PROBLEMATIC AND FRANKLY ADULT CONTENT- IT IS ONE SOCIAL MEDIA SCHOLAR PUT IT WE WE'RE JUST NEVER HARD CORE ENOUGH FOR YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM. VIDEOS ABOUT JOGGING THE TWO VIDEOS ABOUT RUNNING ULTRAMARATHONS IN ON AND ON AND ON- VIDEO STREAMING PLATFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE RECOMMEND AND DISSEMINATE VIDEOS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY UPPING THE STAKES AND THEY DO SO IN WAYS THAT THE NUCLEAR CHILDREN- AB. FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE THE USEFUL FIRST STEP TOWARD TRY TO CREATE A CRAP THE TO SPACE FOR KIDS ONLINE- WALKING. EAGER AND WELL. OF SUGGESTED FOR IMPROVING FROM AND WE ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE MOVE THIS TO FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO THE SOME SO MISTER OFF PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES. HAMLEYS IN GERMAN IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AGAIN ONE ZERO IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT. THIS TIME WE HAVE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR VERY GOOD LET'S MOVE TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE DILLON HOFFMAN WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION. MR HOFFMAN ARE YOU ON THE LINE PLEASE. S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON HOFFMAN O BEHALF INTENET EXPECTATIONS OUR MEMBERS ARE STILL REVIEWING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE APPRECIATE THE NEW DIRECTION AND CERTAINLY THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE TOO NARROW THE BILL- WERE POSTED ON PRINT- AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE A- NEW FORMAL POSITION BUT ARE EVALUATING NOT ALONG WITH THE LANGUAGE- JERRY UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION. BEHIND THIS DON'T THINK IT'S A WERE THE ONES I MEMBERSHIP OR KID FRIENDLY CONTENT WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE OUR PLATFORMS ARE SAFE FOR KIDS. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE A FEW CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OCT FIRST AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE PURPORTS TO REGULATE CONTENT AND CONTROLS FOR ACCOUNTS CREATED FOR KIDS BY THEIR PARENTS. HOWEVER AS DRAFTED THIS BILL COULD PULL IN CONTENT AND CONTROLS FOR ENTIRE PLATFORM- FOR EXAMPLE A KID FROM THE MOVIE LIKE FROZEN TO FOR EXAMPLE CAN BE VIEWED BY A CHILD ON. THE COUNT THAT'S CURRENTLY DEFINED THAT YOU CAN'T COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE DIRECTED TO CHILDREN- TWO DRESSES WE SUGGEST TAILORING THE BILL THE USER PROFILES WHICH CAN BE CREATED BY PARENTS FOR KIDS. RATHER THAN TWO ACCOUNTS WHICH I THINK BETTER MATCHES- THE BILL'S INTENT. ADDITIONALLY THE SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIES OF CONTENT THAT AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE PROHIBITS ARE CRITICAL TO IMPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE AMENDED- THE BILL PROHIBITS CONTENT INCLUDE SEXUAL ACTIVITIES PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE VIOLENCE OR ADULT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF WHICH ARE ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE AND THEREFORE CREATE UNCERTAINTY FOR PLATFORMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE LION KING INCLUDES DEPICTIONS OF CARTOON VIOLENCE HARRY POTTER SERIES HAVE SEVERAL BELIEVE THE SMALLEST OF THE COMPLIANCE- AND TANGLED FOLLOWS. THE PUBLIC FROM EMOTIONAL- ALL OF THESE AND MORE COULD BE PROHIBITED BY THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE AND PARENTS WOULD CONSIDER THEM. AS YOU CORPORATE COURSE I'M- UNDER AGE CAN'T. FIND WE APPRECIATE YOUR- TO FOR THE CLASS THE- AT THE DEFINITION OF PLATFORM WELL I AGAIN WE CONTINUE. ALL VERY RELIEVED THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR OF MR.

AND AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS. ONE ZERO. AT THE TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR THE SPRING FACTOR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISSPOKE AND CARD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISS WAX FEW QUESTIONS ONE IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO LIMIT IT TO THE PROFILE OF THE CHILD INSTEAD OF. THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT OF THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN. WE ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THAT WORK BECAUSE I WANT WE WANTED TO BE FOR THE INTENDED AUDIENCE RIGHT- SO I THAT. THAT I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ONE IS ON AND I APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE DEFINITIONS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WE NEED CLARITY IN WHAT IT IS ALLOWED AND NOT ALLOWED- MY- QUESTION THOUGH IS- FOR ALL THE PARENTS IN THE ROOM. YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THIS DANIEL TIGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD WAS A REGULAR IN MY HOUSE STILL REGULAR IN MY HOMEWORK IN YOURS. AND THERE'S A REALLY GOOD CONTENT ON THERE THAT ACTUALLY ROADS BULLYING TO TEACH THE KIDS RIGHT. TO SAY SOMETHING WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO ADDRESS SORT OF CONTENT THAT IS APPROPRIATELY TARGETED TO KIDS TO TEACH THEM ABOUT THESE THINGS- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED. IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. AND ONE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I MEAN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL. IS USEFUL- I'M PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW. THE AUTO PLAY A PIECE OF IT RIGHT WHERE. ANY OF US WHO ARE PARENTS. YOU GIVE YOUR KID YOUR PHONE THEY'RE WATCHING SOMETHING. THIRTY MINUTES LATER THEIR WATCHING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- SO THOSE. I THINK WE HAVE MORE SPACE AND UNDERSTANDING AROUND I THINK THE CONTENT PIECE IS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE BILL TO BE FRANK WITH YOU. IT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON- AND I'M VERY OPEN TO DOING THIS. IN A RIGHT IN THE RIGHT WAY AND WANT TO PRESENT A BILL HOPEFULLY ON THE FLOOR. THAT I THINK. GETS TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN A BETTER WAY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS I MEAN AS A MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN. YOU KNOW THEY'RE AT THE AUTO PLAY FUNCTION IS SOMETHING THAT. MAKES ME NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO USE CERTAIN PLATFORMS YOU. SEEN IT HAPPEN RIGHT YOU YOU SORT OF APPROVE WHAT IT IS THEY WATCH AND THEN THE NEXT THING STARTS ROLLING AND IT'S- COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT RATE. AND IT'S I THINK IT'S A REALLY. ABUSIVE FUTURE ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE USING IT- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS AND I THINK ALL OF US. YOUR POINT NEED. CONTROLS AROUND ASK BECAUSE OUR KIDS ARE USING TECHNOLOGY IN A NEW WAY WE DID IT FOR TELEVISION TO YOUR POINT AND NOW THE- MOST KIDS AREN'T SITTING AROUND WATCHING TELEVISION ANYMORE RIGHT THEY'RE ENGAGING IN THESE PLATFORMS AND SO WE NEED TO BE. DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CHIDREN ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED- MY LAST QUESTION IS ON ENFORCEMENT. SO UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ALTHOUGH PERHAPS IT'S LIMITED AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LITTLE FURTHER. AND SAID THAT THIS IS AN OPENING PLATFORM. TOURISTS FRAZIER AND I'LL JUST SAY- I'M OPEN TO RECONSIDERING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. OKAY WE DO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE FIFTH PERSON PIECE. YES AND I THINK IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT IS IMPORTANT I DON'T KNOW THAT. I MEAN I GUESS I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT TV RICH FASHION BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. YEAH WHERE IS THE ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A ROBUST IMPORTS IN MAGAZINES. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR PRIVATE ACTION ACTUALLY ALSO DIDN'T PROVIDE FOR MUCH THAT WOULD. BE A MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT IS SORT OF A SEPARATE QUESTION SO I THINK. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK. THAT NEEDS GOOD ENFORCEMENT WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE SORT OF. LAWSUITS COMING FROM NOWHERE RIGHT WHICH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN THANK YOU THOSE ARE ALL EXCELLENT POINTS AND- IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH ME ON THE BILL WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR- SUPPORT VOTE. AND MAYBE CO AUTHORSHIP. WELL I. DEFINITELY BE SUPPORTING ABOUT I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORKING HIM. TO CONTINUE IT IT'S WITH. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IT MUST BE ABLE GO HEAD. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL ONLINE MY COMMENTS WITHOUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM HER INTO- YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES INCLUDING FOR THE RECENTLY WHERE I'VE GIVEN MY SON MY FIVE YEAR OLD SON MY PHONE. TO WATCH AN EPISODE OF DANIEL TIGER AND I COME OVER HE'S WATCHING SOMETHING ON YOUTUBE SO YES- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN AREA I THINK DEEP CONCERN FOR A LOT OF PARENTS AND I YOU KNOW I APPLAUD YOU FOR DIVING IN HERE IT'S LIKE A COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ONE AND YOU KNOW WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN I KNOW THE ANALYSIS NOTED THAT THERE WERE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AROUND A NUMBER THE DEFICIT. A DEFINITIONS INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF THE- ARMY. AND I KNOW THAT YOU SUGGESTED THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ITSELF. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT- REALLY DIFFICULT OR CHALLENGING ISSUES HERE- BUT ONES THAT ARE REALLY WORTHY OF ATTENTION SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO DO IT WITH PRECISION AND TO DO IT IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THAT WE CAN FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND YEP AND- I AM VERY COMMITTED TO THAT AND I'VE- HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS UP ON THE DICE ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC PIECE IN PARTICULAR. AWESOME THANK YOU BOBBY PART TO SUPPORT IT'LL CONNECT. COMMENTS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. QUESTIONS WHICH GALLAGHER GO AHEAD PLEASE. YES THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE TALKED IN THE AND OBVIOUSLY- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSE TO MY HEART ABOUT INSURING THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR USE- YOU HAD A- THE BILL. LAST YEAR REGARDING. RATTLE CONSENT FOR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS- AND A AND I THINK THIS IS ALONG THAT SAME SPIRIT- I WILL START ALL START WITH THIS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE BILL- IS. THIS THE LANGUAGES SAYS ANY DESIGN FEATURES SETTING THAT ALLOWS A COVERED USER TO MAKE PURCHASES. LIKE RIGHT A LOT- BECAUSE HE OF GOD KNOWS BILLS FROM LIKE WHERE IS THE THREE NINETY NINE COME FROM WHAT DID YOU BUY YEAH- AND- I THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME SOME GROUND TYPE ARTICLES FOR ON THAT ONE. ON THAT- AND I AND I THINK LIKE IN JUNE THE CONCEPT HERE IS A GOOD ONE WHICH IS YOU KNOW A SPECIAL WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED IN ON. APPS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR KIDS RIGHT. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW LANGUAGE DOESN'T QUITE CAPTURE THAT BECAUSE IT SAYS KIND OF COPY ANY CONTENT- ACTED TOWARDS KITTENS AND FACT I THINK IF MAYBE IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN THAT THAT'S ONE. YEAH YEP ONE THING I THINKING ABOUT- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT- AND THEN I THINK JUST THE DEFINITIONS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE- NO INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT- I THINK ON THE VIOLENCE LIKE WAS BROUGHT UP I MEAN WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF CARTOONS DISNEY. CARTOONS IT MIGHT YOU KNOW SOMEONE COULD SAY OR ARE VIOLENT RIGHT. BUT DON'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE WE THINK WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE- I THINK THE CHALLENGE OF THIS BILL IS PICKING OUT LIKE HOW DO WE DETERMINE THAT I MEAN DO YOU USE LIKE THE P. G. G. RADIANCE. AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING- ADULT ACTIVITIES. I'M NOT SURE LIKE WHAT THAT IS AT THIS POINT I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO GET OUT WITH THAT ONE AS WELL AS ADULT CONTENT YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT AND THIS IS ALL STILL LIKE I MEAN YOU'RE RAISING I THINK HONESTLY THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND MAYBE THAT IS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT A P. G. G. COULD THAT BE IS AN APPARATUS THAT WE USE FOR THIS- I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. MR GALLAGHER ON THIS- BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTHY OF EXPLORATION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- AND WANT TO DO THIS IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY THAT WE ARE ENSURING THAT OUR KIDS AND I I'M NOT I SHOULD ALSO SAY I'M NOT ONE THESE SORT OF LIKE PRUDISH TYPE PEOPLE- BUT I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLDS RIGHT AND SHE USES MY PHONE AND WE START SOMETHING WE END UP IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE- SO I'M GRAPPLING TO WITH HOW DO YOU CREATE A POLICY THAT ENABLES YOU TO PROTECT YOUR KIDS. AND ENSURE THAT THEIR VIEWING THE CONTENT THAT YOU THINK IS SUITABLE FOR THEM- AND GIVE PARENTS THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL RIGHT WITHOUT- YOU KNOW HAVING SORT OF A NANNY STATE SORT OF BILL RIGHT SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS I'M I'M GRAPPLING WITH BUT I'M I'M COMMITTED TO SORT OF SING IT THROUGH AND TO WORKING WITH. BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND ANYONE HERE ON THE DIETS. TO HAS OPINIONS ON HOW WE THINK WE CAN DO THAT. SO AND- AB GRAPPLED WITH THE SAME THING SO I GUESS MY QUESTION MY A MAYBE A PLAN LAST QUESTION FOR YOU AND MAYBE FOR THE UP ANYBODY ON THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO TRY AND ANSWER THIS. YOU KNOW HAVE YOU TALK TO THE OPPOSITION ABOUT HOW HOW THEY COULD DO THAT FOR THEIR UNDER THIRTEEN APPS YEAH I MEAN WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY PRODUCTIVE AND I THINK WE'LL- AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND MAY HAVE TO. MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED THE BILL YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON KIND OF WHERE WE LAND. FOR A- AND OUT OF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO LAND BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK TO BEAT PEOPLE CONTENT ON IT LIKE IF YOU START OFF ON THAT APP AND IT THAT CONTENT IS OKAY BUT THEN WHY IS IT THAT YOU'RE HAVING OTHER VIDEOS COME IN THAT THE THAT RIDE HAILING SEND YOU IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. RIGHT AND HOW COULD THAT MAY BE FIXED BY THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK MY ONE QUESTION WE SHOULD ALWAYS ASK IS A INDUSTRY HOW CAN YOU DO THIS. SO YOU CAN MEET THE EXPECTATION OF. OF PARENTS. YEAH YOU KNOW AS THE AS A CONSUMER AS WELL. AS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WANTING THEIR KIDS TO BE A CONSUMER OF CERTAIN THINGS. RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW I MY DAUGHTER WILL START ON YOU TO WATCHING PEPPA PIG AND THEN LIKE THIRTY MINUTES LATER SHE'S WATCHING LIKE SKITTLES BEING PICKED UP AND PUT FROM A CUP TO A BALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH DOESN'T FEEL LIKE. THE BEST QUALITY CONTENT RIGHT SO HOW DO YOU WHAT DO IN THE SITUATION I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE STOPPING OF AUTO PLAY IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- WHICH IS IN THE BILL I THINK THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS AROUND THE DEFINITIONS OF LIKE THE SOME OF THE CONTENT PIECE THAT YOU'RE RAISING. AND I AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO WORK WITH THE ON. NAY FIGURED OUT THE- I WOULD LOVE TO WORK OUTLINED DEFINITION ACT. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM GRANT. YEAH I JUST LIKE TO ADD MY THOUGHTS ON THE THERE'S SORT OF TWO COMPONENTS OF THE BILL AS STANDS NOW THAT I THINK ARE EXCELLENT THAT WOULD GIVE PARENTS MORE CONTROL AND PROTECT KIDS AND THAT'S THE AUTO PLATE OF PORTION OF THE BILL AND THE PROTECTION ON THE FINANCIAL PIECE WHICH I'VE WORKED LIKE MR GALLAGHER AND YOU ON THE OTHER PRIOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION WITH. MIXED SUCCESS TO TRY TO IN THE PRACTICE OF MARKETING TO CHILDREN- WHICH IS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS WHICH IS NOT A GOOD PRACTICE MIGHT BE. ARGUABLY SHOULDN'T BE LEGAL- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT AND THE AUTO PLAY THING I'VE SEEN I HAD THE SAME ISSUE IN MY HOUSEHOLD RIGHT I MEAN. THE KID STARTS WHY IT'S NOT LIKE CARTOONS ON SATURDAY MORNING LIKE YOU KNOW I GREW UP WATCHING DUCKTALES AND BATMAN OR WHATEVER. AND THE THING GOES FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND THEN IT'S DONE. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE- THE PARENTS KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING N YOU KNOW WHAT'S ON THE SHOW THEY KNOW WHAT'S APPROPRIATE YOU GOTTA. ACCEPTABLE LIST AND UNACCEPTABLE LIST AND THE PARENTS HAD THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THAT AND NOW IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE- THE THING LEADS TO SOMETHING ELSE LEAD SOMETHING ELSE LEAD SOMETHING ELSE. FIRST YOU SAID YAK YOU KNOW. HEY HEY SIX YEAR OLD YOU CAN WATCH. YOU CAN WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF MINECRAFT OR WATCH OTHER PEOPLE PLAY MINECRAFT WHICH IS A BIG THING NOW. JUST WEIRD. AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME SHOOTING THING OR SOMETHING'S GOT EFFORTS ON IT YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT HOW DID YOU GET TO THAT IN FORTY MINUTES RIGHT. SO THAT IS GREAT- THE CONTENT PIECE AS WE'VE TALKED OFFLINE. I THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC. I'M FROM A FIRST MINUTE STANDPOINT AND- FROM A PARENTAL CONTROL STANDPOINT. IN THAT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE SOME. BUREAUCRAT THE AUTHORITY TO TELL. TO OVERRIDE EFFECTIVELY BEFORE MY WIFE AND I AND YOU KNOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHAT OUR KIDS WATCH AND- WATCH. SO COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IT. HI AGAIN TWO PARTS OF THE SERVER. EXCELLENT IN ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE NEED IN IN. IN THIS. IN THE STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. TO PROTECT KIDS THE LAST PARTS PROBLEMATIC BUT I HOPE WE CAN. GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WORK PRESERVING THAT PARENTAL CONTROL ND PRESERVING YOU KNOW THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES. NO I APPRECIATE THAT I'VE WORKED WITH MANY VIEW ON THESE TYPES OF BILLS AND I THINK THIS COMMITTEES VERY THOUGHTFUL IN. HOW WE THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS- ESPECIALLY ALL THE PARENTS HELD. I WELCOME THE INPUT AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD HOPEFULLY TODAY AND WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH WITH YOU WANTED. AND I FOR JUST THAT YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE ONLY AUTHORS IN THIS BODY THAT CAN PROBABLY LAND THIS PLANE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE TAKING IT OFF AND GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT. WAS CARILLO CURRENTLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I LOOKING HEARING I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO FOR BRINGING UP THAT THE CARTOONS OF THE NEED TO SAY A- DUCKTALES. DUCKTALES MOVE AND- UNDER VERY UNDERRATED WAS ALSO DARK WING DUCK. CLEARLY WE ARE AGING OURSELVES. HOWEVER IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHICH HAS NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THE MINUTE IN THE MUSEUM NOW- BUT BUT THANK YOU I THINK A WE GREW UP VERY DIFFERENTLY AND WE ARE NOW IN A VERY DIFFERENT SPACE IN WHICH WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MY PARENTS WERE VERY STRICT I HAD ONE HOUR OF TELEVISION SO I WAS VERY CAREFUL AND- VERY PICKY ABOUT THE CARTOONS THAT I WOULD WATCH- AND AFTER THAT IT WAS LIKE HOMEWORK AND READING AND PLAYING OUTSIDE AND IT'S- WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR KIDS NOW IT'S VERY DIFFERENT- MY- CHIEF OF STAFF WAS LETTING ME KNOW THAT. HER NEPHEW WAS WATCHING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ON HOW TO DESTROY TOYS AND STARTED FLUSHING THEM DOWN THE TOILET COSTING THE FAMILY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF REPAIR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONTROL THAT SO I WANT TO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A IN A GOOD PLACE. ON THIS BILL AND IT'S WE'RE IN A VERY DIFFERENT SPACE IN WHICH WE ARE IN A NEW WORLD THAT HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT TECHNOLOGY AN AXIS LOOKS LIKE AND THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO SO THIS IS COMPLETELY- BUT A DIFFERENT SPACE BUT I HAD THIS IDEA AS WELL THAT WHILE PARENTS ARE ALSO TRYING TO REGULATE WHAT CHILDREN DO ON. ON THEIR DIGITAL DEVICES I'VE ALSO BECOME VERY CONCERNED WITH WHAT PARENTS DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN ON DIGITAL DEVICES AND POSTING PHOTOS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN THEY GET OLDER THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OF THEIR DIGITAL IDENTITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT I THINK AS PARENTS ALSO SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS THE IMPACT. THAT SHARING THOSE PHOTOS OF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SEEM VERY INNOCENT THAT LATER ON IN LIFE WHEN THAT CHILD IS AN ADULT THAT PHOTO HAS BEEN OUT THERE AND THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THERE THE DIGITAL- IDENTITY SO I HOPE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU AND I CAN WORK ON ON IN THE FUTURE I'M VERY HAPPY TO THIS PART OF YOUR BILL TODAY. I APPRECIATE THAT I TOTALLY AGREE AND I'M ALSO SOMEONE WHO DOES POST PHOTOS OF MY CHILDREN BUT ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC FIGURE I'M MOR MORE MINDFUL OF WHAT THAT MEANS- BUT WE ARE IN THIS SORT OF NEW WORLD ORDER- AND THIS. SPACE IN SO I THINK WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP DEFINE. WHAT THAT CAN LOOK LIKE NOT JUST FOR HERE BUT FOR THE REST OF THE pLIKE EVER EVOLVING CHANGING DYNAMICS THAT WE HAVE. TERMS ARE HOW WE ACCESS CONTENT STARTING AT. AGE ZERO I MEAN MY BUT WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS TO SHE COULD LIKE SWIPE THE TECHS UP. PRESSED LIKE THE AD SKIP AD LIKE SHE WAS TO. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT I APPRECIATE IT WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. MOSTLY BECAUSE I HAD. THANK YOU SELLER WORKS TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT- BILL FORD. ADVERTISING AND PRACTICES ESPECIALLY IF THEY GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF ALGORITHMS AND SUCH I KNOW THE OPPOSITION HAS HAS MADE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BEING TOO BROAD TOO TOO HARD O DEFINE BUT I WANNA KNOW AND THIS MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR THE INCIDENT SITUATION AND WORKING WITH YOU IS. UNDER GOOGLE SLASH YOU DO BECAUSE OF THE SAME COMPANY NOW THEY ALREADY HAVE GUIDELINES FOR ADVERTISER FRIENDLY CONTENT WHICH THEY ACTUALLY CONSTANTLY. PERUSE CONTENT AND MAKE IT SO THAT YOU KNOW. IF I IF I VIDEO HAS AN ADD ON IT IS BECAUSE THEY FULFILLED SOME CERTAIN GUIDELINES WHICH HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS IN IT BUT HERE JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY HAVE TO FIND GOOGLE AND YOUTUBE HAS DEFINED ALREADY. IS VIOLENCE ADULT CONTENT SHOCKING CONTENT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES SENSITIVE EVENTS IN CITY NEAR IN CITY HEARING DEMEANING AND ADULT THEMES AND FAMILY CONCERT THERE'S LIKE A LONGER LIST OF THINGS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEFINED SELVES FOR. ADVERTISER FRIENDLY CONTENT AND EVEN CREATE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE SO PERHAPS IF THEY HAVE. IF THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH HOW BROAD OUR DEFINITION IS IN THE BILL MAYBE THEY CAN REFER TO THEIR OWN DEFINITIONS THAT THE CREATED. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE ALREADY FACE BACKLASH FOR MANY MANY YEARS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CONTENT THEY USE WHAT CAN ADVERTISING YOU TO SO. YOU KNOW YOU TO ITSELF ALREADY I THINK HAS A STRONG SENSE OF. OR IS TRYING TO MODERATE ITSELF IN MANY WAYS SO I DO HOPE THAT THEY WILL WORK IN GOOD FAITH WITH YOU. ACTUALLY PLAYED INTO THE LONG BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY DID SOMETHING THEY KNOW IS A PROBLEM. AND SO I REALLY HOPE THAT THE OPPOSITION TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND NOT- STATES TOO VAGUE SO I WAS HAPPY IS FOR YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. IS THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL. MR WE GO AHEAD. YEAH I- BUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT. A DEFINITION AND THEN CONTENT AND- SEEING IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT HE- THIS IS. A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY THE AUTO PLAY A PART IN THE- RABBIT HOLE THAT. MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SILICON VALLEY- WAS MENTIONING AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD TAKE CARE OF THE RABBIT HOLE FOR ADULTS BECAUSE IT SAYS. ONE OF THOSE. FORTUNATELY YEAH THAT'S NOT GREAT OUT WITH SO I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO YOU KNOW HELP YOU WITH THIS BILL GOING FORWARD I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE GREAT I APPRECIATE THAT AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A PODCAST THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLED RABBIT HOLE THAT'S ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE FOR ADULT CONTENT BUT- THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY.
