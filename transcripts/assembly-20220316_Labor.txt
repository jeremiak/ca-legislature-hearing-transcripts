ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WHO IS HERE AND LOOKS LIKE READY TO GO. AND SO THIS IS A SB SIX ONE IT DOES HAVE. THE IN IRAQ- DO PASTOR PROBES- A DOCK WEBER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN OH ONE THE STATE CALIFORNIA CALL CENTER JOBS ACT. A BILL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS CALL CENTER WORKERS AND STOP THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF CORPORATIONS REAPING THE BENEFIT OF STATE FUNDING AND SUBSIDIES WHAT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING JOBS OVERSEAS. CALL CENTERS ARE A MAJOR ECONOMIC FORCE AND THE U. S. REPRESENTING ABOUT 3% OF OUR WORKFORCE. YET THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CONTRACT SENATE JOBS HAVE DECLINED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. LARGELY DUE TO OUTSOURCING AND LAYOFFS. IT HAS BECOME ALL TOO COMMON FOR CORPORATIONS TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF STATE FUNDING AND SUBSIDIES WHAT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING JOBS OVERSEAS. FOR EXAMPLE OUR SALES AND USE TAX EXCLUSION PROGRAM AWARDS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO ELIGIBLE COMPANIES WHO HAVE CALL CENTERS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION. THESE OFFSHORING PRACTICES HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES AS THEIR ONCE GOOD PAYING JOBS ARE TAKEN AWAY. CALIFORNIA MUST PROTECT HARD WORKING WOMEN AND MEN EMPLOYED IN CALL CENTERS AND CORPORATIONS. STE AND CORPORATION SHOULD NOT REAP THESE BENEFITS IF THEY OUTSOURCE THEIR JOBS. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY BEHIND OTHER STATES SUCH AS NEW YORK CONNECTICUT NEW JERSEY ALABAMA NEVADA AND LOUISIANA WHO HAVE ALL TAKEN ACTION AND ENACTED COMMONSENSE REFORMS TO ENSURE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT LEFT FOOTING THE BILL WHEN CORPORATIONS MOVE THEIR JOBS OVERSEAS. AB SIXTEEN NO ONE IS A JOB AND TAX PAYER PROTECTION MEASURE THAT REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO GIVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS NOTICE WHEN RELOCATING 30% OR MORE OF THEIR CALL CENTER JOBS FROM CALIFORNIA. TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. IN ADDITION THESE EMPLOYERS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING STATE GRANTS GUARANTEED LOANS OR TAX CREDITS FOR FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE STATE AGENCIESWILL CONTRACT OUT FOR CALL CENTRE SERVICES TO PERFORM AT LEAST 90% OF THE SERVICES AND THE STATE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND A SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED AMERICANS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATIVE BOARDS SMART TRANSPORTATION DIVISION AND THE UNITED STEELWORKERS DISTRICT TWELVE. HERE TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY. IS A NICE YOUR HERNANDEZ REPRESENTING THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER-CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE NOT HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE WHICH ENCOMPASSES CALIFORNIA NEVADA AND HAWAII WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL I THANK DR WEBER FOR AUTHORING THIS LEGISLATION- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALKING LEGISLATURE ABOUT JOB CREATION JOB RETENTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- INSTEAD IN PARTICULAR. TRYING TO PRESERVE JOBS THAT- THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS WITH A LIVING WAGE AND ALSO TO ALLOW THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND CALL CENTER JOBS REALLY ARE CAREER TYPE JOBS- LOT OF CBA WORKERS HAVE BEEN A CALL CENTERS FOR TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS. SO IT IS REALLY A WAY FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH A CAREER TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES- HERE IN THE STATE AND AS WE STATED EARLIER IT'S A FORTUNATE THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING. NUMBER OF JOBS BEING MOVED BOTH OUT OF STATE AND OVERSEAS- THERE WERE SOME CALL CENTERS CLOSED IN ANAHEIM BAKERSFIELD ATWATER SACRAMENTO OAKLAND AND THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CALL CENTER EMPLOYEES AND SAN RAMON FRESNO SAN DIEGO COMMERCE PASADENA ESCONDIDO IN TORRANCE IS JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THESE JOBS CONTINUE TO BE MOVED- AND IT THIS IS BOTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACTS FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES. NOT SO THIS BILL IS NOT A WHOLE SET OF RESTRICTIONS ON OUTSOURCING WHAT THIS DOES IS REALLY AS WAS STATED EARLIER PROTECT TAXPAYER MONEY IN ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE USED TO SUBSIDIZE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO REQUIRED ALL CONTRACTS FOR CALL CENTER JOB SUPPORT STATE AND ENTITIES STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS OKAY CONTRACT TERMS WERE LOOSENED AND EVENTUALLY THEY'LL THEY WERE GONE SO THAT NOW THOSE VENDORS COULD CAN'T TAKE THOSE JOBS THE OTHER STATES- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM- AND ALSO YOU KNOW. THE PRIVATE SECTOR THESE COMPANIES DID HAVE THE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE MOVING THEM OVERSEAS SO IT CAN BE DONE WE DID TALK WITH CW WAY AND THE LEGISLATURE NEW YORK SINCE THERE LAWS. ADOPTING LAWS AFTER SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN THAN THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE HERE- AND THEY SAID IT'S BEEN WORKING IN FACT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN AS AN UPTICK IN JOBS IN CALL CENTER. JOBS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A- MAJOR BENEFIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST JUST INSURING. OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE USED TO PROTECT JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I AND I DID MENTION BEFORE THAT THOSE THAT HAVE. BEEN VOTE IN THE COMMITTEE HAD NO MY USUAL PRACTICES UP TO.

A GOOD AFTERNOON ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB SIXTY NO ONE A WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENSE OF THE BILL TO KEEP JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR CONCERN ULTIMATELY WITH THIS BILL IN THE PRIOR BILL IS THAT IT WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE BILL DOES IS PENALIZED ANY COMPANY THAT HAS CALL CENTRE OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DECIDES TO LATER MOVE THOSE OPERATIONS TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. THE FIRST REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS NOTICE BEFORE ANY SUCH MOVE AND ANY EVEN GOOD FAITH MISTAKE OF THAT WOULD SUBJECT THEM TO PENALTIES THAT ARE PRETTY STAGGERING OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY PLUS PENALTIES UNDER PAGA. A SECOND THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE DIR TO POST THE NAME OF THOSE COMPANIES ONLINE AND THEN MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IT WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TO DENY THOSE COMPANIES ANY STATE BENEFITS OR GRANTS OR TAX CREDITS FOR A FULL FIVE YEARS I WON COMPANIES ARE WEIGHING YOU KNOW WHERE TO PLACE NEW JOBS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF LAWS THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WILL TO TURN THEM FROM CHOOSING CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT JOBS LIKE THOSE LOCATED IN A CALL CENTER THAT CAN EASILY BE DONE REMOTELY IN OTHER STATES- TWO YEAR AT SORRY THREE YEARS AGO IN TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM VETO THIS ALMOST EXACT SAME BILL. AND HE SAID IN HIS VETO MESSAGE THAT WHILE HE OF COURSE APPRECIATE THE INTENT TO PROTECT JOBS HERE THAT HIS CONCERN AS WELL WAS THAT THIS WOULD DETER COMPANIES FROM INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ULTIMATELY HURTS CALIFORNIA WORKERS SO WE THINK THAT VETO MESSAGE IS STILL VERY. TODAY ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT FINANCIAL DEVASTATION THE BUSINESSES HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THERE BE EVEN MORE CHOOSY WHEN THEY'RE REALLY CHOOSING WHERE TO PUT THEIR JOBS AND WHERE TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WE CAN HANG OUT AND IF YOU LIKE OKAY SPOKESMEN HAVE QUESTIONS AND IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION. IN THE ROOM. OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD OF THE PHONE LINES ANYONE IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE. THE STATE OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTEEN OH ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD.

OF COURSE OUTLINE AND MOVED ON BUT AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. DECEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- MAYBE IT WAS VETOED BEFORE BUT TO THIS IS THE DOING APPROVED. VERSION AND I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP I THINK WHAT'S THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS THAT. IT ISN'T JUST ANY CALL CENTER TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE MONEY TAXPAYER MONEY I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION THAT IF WE'RE- GIVING AND LOANING AND GIVING. ANY KIND OF AID WITH OUR TAXPAYER MONIES. THEN THE BUSINESS SHOULD BE KEPT HERE AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE FROM MY COMMUNITY MARTINA ORTEGA I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS ABLE TO CALL IN FOR MY LOCAL C. W. WEI WHO WAS. A GREAT PROPONENT PROPONENT OF THIS BILL AND FAILED TO ADVISE ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP. OUR LOCAL WORKERS- TO GREAT EXTENT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THINKING AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MOTION MEADOW MAJORITY LEADER. RIGHT. DECEMBER JONES SAWYER AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- AND I'VE MAYBE ADD A LITTLE MORE COLOR CONTEXT TO IT- THEY ALSO MAY HELP YOU WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR- THE PHARMACY W. AWAY FROM UNION MEMBER AND A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF PACIFIC BELL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD. I WORKED IN WHAT WAS CALLED A PHONE CENTERS STORE NOT A CELL PHONES IN A STORE. BUT PHONES THAT YOU PLUG INTO THE WALL. AND I SO PHONES OUT OF THEIR. LATER BUT THEY CONSOLIDATED INTEGRATE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL THE OF ALL THE PHONE COMPANIES AND I WORK FOR EIGHTEEN T. IN A CALL CENTER WITH FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE THE COLOR PRESIDENT EMBEDDED BASED ORGANIZATION. AND WE TO CALL STIRS HAVE PEOPLE HOOK UP THEIR PHONES ALL OVER- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I REMEMBER ALMOST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF CORPORATE WE TALK ABOUT MOVING TO TEXAS ALABAMA. I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE DEVASTATING IMPACT IT HAD ON THE EMPLOYEES. THE EMPLOYEE MORALE WAS HORRIBLE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD PAY YOUR RENT NEXT YEAR BUY A CAR BUY A HOUSE SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE BECAUSE EVERY YEAR ALMOST EVERY YEAR. AT&amp;T WAS TALKING ABOUT MOVING FIVE HUNDRED JOBS OUT OF LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME PASADENA AND INTO IN INTO IN INTO TEXAS WAS PROBABLY WHY I DON'T LIKE TEXAS TO THIS DAY- BUT IF THEY COULD HAVE. COULD HAVE JUST SEEN AT THE BREAK ROOM IN THE LUNCH ROOM AND AFTERWARDS WHEN PEOPLE GET TOGETHER- HOW WORRIED THEY WERE ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FUTURES AND JUST TO TALK OF IT. WAS JUST DEVASTATING- THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS LAW- WHY IS A NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY WOULD JUST COME IN AND ABRUPTLY. RODDY HERE WHEN TEXAS YOU GOT. YOU GOT TO MOVE TO TEXAS. IF WE CAN FIND YOU A JOB FOR. YOU JUST HAVE A LOOK AND I DOES FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE CAME MY FRIENDS OF MY STILL KNOW SOMEONE TO THIS DAY- MOST OF THEM DID NOT RETIRE FROM EIGHTEEN ANTI BECAUSE THEY DID MOVE THOSE JOBS OUT OF OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND SHOW UP MMHM I KNOW THE DEVASTATING IMPACT. PERSONAL IMPACT BUT WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND SO LIGHT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU A SIMILAR BIGELOW. IF ANYTHING THAT THAT IS WHERE. I THE RIFLE I DIDN'T BOTHER. THANK YOU WE ARE VERY CLOSE I WOULD TO JOHN WHICH WITH EACH OTHER YOU KNOW THAT THE STORY KIND OF LEADS US FROM THE CRANK PHONE MOMENT ACTUALLY TO THE ROTARY TYPE PHONE DISCUSSION. WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TODAY'S PHONE SYSTEMS. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT DOESN'T EVEN DEAL WITH PHONES ANYMORE. AND SO THE REAL BIG ISSUE HERE IS WHILE WE SEE THE VALUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WHICH IS HELPING CALIFORNIA'S KEEP JOBS HERE AND RETAIN PEOPLE. THE WAR THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND WHAT WE'RE DO SEEING NOW IS MOST OF THESE CALL CENTERS ARE NOT IN AMERICA. THERE IN OTHER COUNTRIES YOU MIGHT FIND ONE IN TENNESSEE YOU MIGHT FIND ONE IN LOUISIANA. MIGHT EVEN FIND ONE A TEXAS STILL. BUT MOST ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY EAST INDIA. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT. AND WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS AND CENTS IN THE BOTTOM LINE HOW TO. GET THINGS DONE. IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER ABOUT THE GRANTS. WITH ALL RESPECT TO THIS TO CALIFORNIA. WE CAN'T KEEP UP WE CAN'T KEEP OUR UNDERWRITING THESE. ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE MOVING. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COMPETE. THEY ARE MORE PROFITABLE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. AND WE ARE USING THOSE SERVICES EVERY DAY EVERY BUSINESS IN THE STATE UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA BAN. INTERNATIONAL TRADE WHICH THIS BILL WILL SURELY BE LITIGATED UNDER THE NAFTA OF LOS. IT'S LIKELY TO NOT MOVE MUCH FARTHER EVEN IF WE ALL VOTE ON IT AND SEND IT FORWARD SO WITH THAT SAID I RESPECT IT WILL HAVE TO OPPOSE YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE- IN TRYING TO HAVE SOME BUSINESS. BUT WHEN A DIFFERENT PLAYING FIELD AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALIZE THAT AND RECOGNIZED AS WE TRY TO PUSH BROADBAND AS WE TRY TO DO ALL THESE OTHER THINGS IT'S ALL TIED TOGETHER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT AND RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU AND HAVE A CHANCE TO OVERCOME A REPUBLICAN PLACEMENTS AND I WANT TO WELCOME BACK IS IN RECOVERY OF- WHO'S REPLACING- IF THE BILL IN THE DEMOCRATIC VACANCY TODAY. SUMMER I THINK YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION I I'D REALLY LIKE TO BE DOCKED WEBER PUT IT IT'S A JOB AND TAXPAYER PROTECTION MEASURE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT IS A VERY WE'RE GETTING TAX OUR MONEY THERE SHOULD BE SOME EXPECTATION. THAT ARE ACTUALLY JOBS CREATED WITH I THINK I THINK OUR- RESIDENTS WOULD EXPECT THAT AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS BILL- AND LUDBEY JINED TWENTY AS A CO AUTHOR AT THE- AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES. THANK YOU. I'M FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING THIS BILL TO BE HEARD TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO- HAVE VOICED THEIR SUPPORT AND ALSO FOR THOSE WHO'VE COME TO ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW MY FELLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT. TELLING COMPANIES THAT THEY CANNOT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT IF YOU GO YOU JUST CAN'T REAP THE BENEFIT OF ANY TAX INCENTIVES OR ANY SUBSIDIES FROM CALIFORNIA. SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A CALL CENTER IN INDIA HAVE A CALL CENTER IN INDIA BUT DON'T EXPECT FOR THE TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA IS. TO GIVE YOU ANY BREAKS- AND AS FAR AS PAGLA IS CONCERNED- YOU KNOW PACK ONLY BECOMES RELEVANT TO FILL THE GAP AND LABOR CODE CODE ENFORCEMENT. M. IF THE STATE IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ACT TO STEP IN AND SO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA USE PACKET THAT- HAS VERY STRICT REQUIREMENTS SO IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT A PACK A CLAIM THE EMPLOYEE MATH. MEETS THE FORMAL NOTICE AND WAITING PERIOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY SIX. NINETY EIGHT THE EMPLOYEE MUST ADMIT AB PACKET CLAIM NOTICE TO THE LABOR. AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND GIVE THE AGENCY TIME TO REVIEW AND NOTICE AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT AND WHICH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIM. IF AND ONLY IF THE L. W. D. H. CHOOSES NOT TO INVESTIGATE- OR IT DOES NOT OTHERWISE RESPOND TO THE CLAIM THAT A SPECIFIED TIME. THEN YOU'RE ENTITLED TO BRING A PAGA CLAIM AND SO THIS WOULD UNLIKELY. RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN AND PACKET CLASS AIMS. AND TO THE- THAT GOVERNOR HAD VETOED BEFORE- THAT WAS AT THE TIME. AS WITH STATUS. AND I'M A PHYSICIAN I BELIEVE AN EVIDENCE BASED ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM THAT WE DO HAVE NOW. IS EVIDENCE THAT THESE LAWS WORK AS WAS STATED. BY MISTER HERNANDEZ. AYE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN NEW YORK WHICH IS STRICTER THAN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW. HAS ACTUALLY SHOWN IS TIED INTO UPTICK IN JOBS NOT A LOS ANGELES TIMES- SO I JUST WANTED TO DEFINITELY ADDRESS THOSE POINTS- ANY CONCLUSION I WANT TO STATE THAT CORPORATE TAX INCENTIVES AND SUBSIDIES. SHOULD BE BASED IN THE STATE WHERE THE JOBS ARE. I. E. WHERE THE TAXPAYERS ARE LOCATED. CONTINUING TO SUBSIDIZE CORPORATIONS THAT EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS. IT'S A DISSERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND ONLY SERVES TO INCENTIVIZE THIS BEHAVIOR FROM CORPORATIONS. THIS BILL WILL SUPPORT OUR CALL CENTER WORKERS RETAIN JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND PRIVATE EYES ARE SCARCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. TO COMPANIES INVESTING LOCALLY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. SOMEONE THAT IS TAKEN ON NOT MORE THAN ONE OCCASION AND FORMALLY VETOED BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR AND YOUR AND YOUR WORKS I DON'T TAKE A LOT OF WORK. TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND HOW A SOCIAL PASS OFFICIATED. WE DO HAVE A MOTION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PASS TO APPROACH. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM A CINEMA REYES SECOND BY SOME MEMBERS JONES SAWYER MADAM SECRETARY. TAKE WILL ON THE VOTE. MOTION IS DUE PASSED APPROPRIATE. KALRA HI KALRA HI BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER AYE REYES REYES I'D CHEN. CHEN KNOWN WARD BY WARD HI CARILLO CARILLO HI THERE THE BILL'S OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FILE ITEM TO AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN SUMMARIZE YOUR CURRY IS HERE READY TO GO. ALL RIGHT WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PERCEIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MAKE IT QUICK GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER YOU WORK ON THE ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. TRULY APPRECIATED. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC WORKS TO INCLUDE FUEL REDUCTION ACTIVITIES PERFORMED AS PART OF A WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROJECT THIS WILL BETTER PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES BY ENSURING THAT WORKERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE WELL TRAINED. USING THE SAFEST PRACTICES AND PAID PREVAILING WAGE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE THE STATE SAW CLOSE TO NINE THOUSAND ACTIVE WILDFIRES THAT BURNED MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF LAND. AND SADLY COSTS THREE CALIFORNIANS THEIR LIVES. GIVEN THIS NEW REALITY THE STATE HAS POSTED STRONG STRONG EMPHASIS ON WILDFIRE IN MITIGATION EFFORTS. THIS WORK TYPICALLY TYPICALLY INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL CHIPPING RURAL ROAD FUEL BREAKS FIREBREAKS AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHILE FOR MITIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE SPREAD OF DANGEROUS FIRES. WE ALREADY RELY ON FIRE MITIGATION FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS RANGE RANGING FROM PROTECTING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEFENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN MAKES CLEAR THAT LOCAL WORKERS PERFORMING HAZARDOUS LABOR INTENSIVE WORK DESERVED TO BE PROPERLY PREPARED FOR THE JOBS AND PAID A LIVABLE WAGE FOR THEIR DUTIES. WE HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FROM SEVERAL LABOR AND TRADE ORGANIZATIONS THAT KNOW THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE A PREVAILING WAGE TO SUPPORT BOTH THE WORKERS DOING THIS WORK AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY PROTECT. PASSING A B. SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN WILLSHOW CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE ENSURING OUR WORKERS ARE WELL TREAT HIM FAIRLY PAID- THREE TODAY TO TESTIFY SUPPORT TIM CRIMMINS FOR THE NEVADA CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS. AND JOE CRUZ FROM THE LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA THANK YOU GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND AS MENTIONED FOR EACH WITNESSES UP TO TWO MINUTES SECONDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF TIM CRAM INTERNATIONAL OPERATING YEARS I THINK I'LL DISPENSE WITH READING WITH READING COMMENT TO MAYBE A COUPLE QUICK POINTS- PERSONAL THIS BILL IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC POLICY YOU'VE- WE'VE HAD FOR YEARS- PAYMENT WORKERS. AREN'T PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS ON PUBLIC ASSETS WITH PUBLIC FUNDS REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE THIS IS IN A FAR STEP FROM THAT AT ALL. A NUMBER TWO- THESE WORK ZONES ARE TALKING ABOUT ART V. CONSISTENTLY THE MOST HAZARDOUS OF A VERY DISTANT BASIS IF YOU LOOK THAT UP YOU'LL SEE THAT. A PREVAILING WAGE WITH- WITH THE PARTNERSHIP TRAINING WILL REDUCE THOSE ACCENTS ON THOSE VERY- HAZARDS PROJECTS- BUT ALSO OF REMINDS YOU CURRENTLY NOW UNDER STATUTE REQUIRING PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE HOW. IS THIS REQUIRED FOR TREE REMOVAL OF THE HAULING AND DISPOSAL OF MATERIAL AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT THAT IS REQUIRED PREVAILING WAGE NOW AND VERY SIMILAR TO FIRE MITIGATION WORK- AND I'D SAY THE SKILL SETS. THAT THIRTY BEING USED NOW CLOSELY MONITOR ALL THOSE REQUESTS UNDER PREVAILING WAGE- ALSO IT SHOULD BE NOTED TO THAT. OF VOLUNTEER WORK WORK DONE BY CONSERVATION CORPS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE IN THIS BILL THAT'S NOT PAID- CHANGE THAT AT ALL THAT COULD STILL BE CONTINUED UNDER THIS BILL- ALSO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK. IN YOU'LL SEE A OF ADOPTING OUR STATE WORKFORCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE THINK THIS HELPS THAT. IN THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE MEMBERS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS TRAVELING TO URBAN AREAS TO WORK. WITH THE EXACT SAME SKILLS THAT THEY CAN BE USING RIGHT IN THEIR COMMUNITY PERFORMED AT IF YOU'VE GOT COMMON BENEFITS COMMON WAGE RATES THEY CAN STAY HOME AND PERFORM THAT WORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTS- AND AGAIN I THINK A LEAD CLICK. AGENTS HE- WE SAY A PROVIDES ON THE PROJECTS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU UNSCR MISTER THIS COULD BE BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS. THE EVERYBODY'S FACE- FIRST I WANT TO THANK OF THE AUTHOR WHO'S BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY. A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE- NOT JUST FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION BUT FOR WORKING PEOPLE INTO SURE THEY'RE SAFE- ON THESE VERY DANGEROUS JOBS- IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS- THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE TREE WORKERS. THEY CAN EXPERIENCE FIFTEEN TIMES HIGHER. FATALITY RATE. THEY'RE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INJURED. IN THESE OCCUPATIONS FROM WORKING IN THESE VERY DANGEROUS AREAS. OF SO. PART OF THAT PREVAILING WAGE IS OUR RIGOROUS FURNITURE PROGRAM AND BEFORE YOU PICK UP ONE TOOL. YOU ARE TAKING CPR FIRST AID OSHA SAFETY AND HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIAL- HANDLING SO YOU GO INTO THOSE- THOSE JOBS ALREADY PREPARED- UNFORTUNATE FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO SOMETIMES- SO WE'RE REALLY. PROUD OF OUR PROGRAMS. I THINK- MISTER CRIMSON THIS MADE A GOOD COMMENT ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE REALLY GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AGREED ECONOMY. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN IS ONE OF THOSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE AREAS OF THE STATE OF. FAR REACHING AREAS. FOR TRAVELING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO A AS A MEMBER KALRA DISTRICT. UP FOR WORK- THIS WILL ALLOW THOSE FOLKS TO STAY HOME. TO WORK AND CREATE A ANOTHER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY LIKE WE REALLY NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN THIS INDUSTRY- SO WITH THAT I- I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS IT'S A GREAT BILL IT'S A IT'S A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND WE SIMPLY REPEAT YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR A BI SEVEN SEVENTEEN.

DR ON THE OF THE BILL FROM DECEMBER CARILLO. IS THERE A SECOND. SECOND INCINERATORS SO YOU'RE OFF TO A GOOD START DR. I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THE BILL AND THE RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY IT WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL FORCE THEM TO WORK UNDER DURESS WITH LITTLE OR NO PAY AT ALL. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WHERE TRAFFICKED WORKERS FACE SUCH AS THREATS FROM EMPLOYERS WHO ARE RELATING OR REACTING. TO ME SUCH AS THREATS FROM EMPLOYERS RELATING TO THEIR OWN DOCUMENTATION STATUS FROM THE WITHHOLDING OF THEIR WAGES AND FROM THE THREATS AND SAFETY OF THEIR OWN FAMILY. ALL OF THESE INTIMIDATION TACTICS CAN PREVENT VICTIMS FROM REPORTING THEIR TRAFFICKERS. WHILE THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS WHICH PROSECUTES TRAFFICKING CRIMES THERE IS NO STATE AGENCIES THAT HAS A MANDATE TO LOOK FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY WILL CREATE A LABOR TRAFFICKING UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS A DEPARTMENT WHICH IS ALREADY TASKED WITH ADMINISTERING AND ENFORCING LAWS GOVERNING WORKERS. THIS LABOR TRAFFICKING UNITS WILL NOT ONLY INVESTIGATE CASES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING AND COORDINATE WITH ENTITIES WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE BUT IT WILL ALSO SERVE AS A POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE VICTIMS OF THIS ABUSE. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT ITS WORKERS BY STOPPING TRAFFICKING BEFORE IT STARTS MMHM. TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE A FORMER MEMBER OF OUR ASSEMBLY WHO IS NOW A COMMISSIONER WITH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IN DION ERIN- AND CHRISTOFERSON CHESS FROM WESTERN CENTER OF LONG POVERTY. COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER ERIN- YES THANK YOU SO MUCH MET COMMISSIONER PLEASE THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THANK YOU DR- HAS SAID MY NAME IS DIONNE ERIN- AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION- APPOINTED ACTUALLY BY THE PRO TEM. AND I'M HERE TODAY I WANTED TO SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY. THE COMMISSION FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH IT IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ISSUEDA SERIES OF THREE REPORTS EXAMINING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING. HORRIFIC FORM OF MODERN SLAVERY. THAT EXPLOITS INNOCENT WORKERS THROUGH FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION TRAFFICKING STEM FROM THE FACT THAT EXISTING EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SEX TRAFFICKING THOUGH MANY EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IS MUCH MORE PROPELLANT PREVALENT. TRAFFICKERS PREY ON THE MOST AS DOES THE ASSEMBLYMAN SAID PREY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMOUNT AMONG US REGARDLESS OF AGE GENDER OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS. EACH YEAR HUNDREDS OF NON LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TO SEEK HELP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YET IN OUR REPORT ENTITLED LABOR TRAFFICKING STRATEGIES TO HELP VICTIMS AND BRING TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT NO STATE AGENCY CURRENTLY HAS A MANDATE TO LOOK FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING. AS A RESULT CASES BRING TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE CASES BRINGING TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE REMAIN VERY RARE. ON AVERAGE THERE ARE LESS THAN THIRTY CONVICTIONS FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. ONLY AN AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF STATE GOVERNMENT CAN CHANGE THIS. IN OUR REPORT WE FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IS PARTICULARLY WELL POSITIONED TO SERVE AT THE FOREFRONT OF COMBATTED LABOR TRAFFICKING CRIMES GET IT CURRENTLY LACKS THE MANDATE TO DO SO. TO ENHANCE EFFORTS TO BRING LABOR TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THE CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY MANDATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PURSUES LABOR TRAFFICKING ALONGSIDE ITS OTHER WORK. TO COMBAT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY WOULD ADVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION BY ESTABLISHING A LABOR TRAFFICKING UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO COMBAT THIS HEINOUS CRIME. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. ONE RESEARCHER GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COST RESPONSES POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PRADA VEHICLE SPONSOR OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY TO FURTHER COMBAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THE ROOT CAUSE OF LABOR TRAFFICKING IS POVERTY. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE IN EXTREME POVERTY. AND THEIR VULNERABILITY TO LABOR TRAFFICKING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN LOW WAGE SECTORS. AND THOSE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS WITHOUT LEGAL PROTECTION UNLIMITED LEGAL PROTECTIONS I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL SOCIAL SERVICES. ARE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE. OFTENTIMES LABOR TRAFFICKERS ARE EXPLOITING THOSE WORKERS WERE THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR REPORT. WITH WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR L. WHO AND OFTENTIMES THERE OTHER OTHER EMPLOYER OTHER SUPERVISORS. ARE WEST PROVIDE UNAUTHORIZED LOANS- AND FINANCIAL. COMPENSATION TO THEM- THAT IS I'M JUST PROUD TO WORKERS AND HAS PUT HIM FURTHER INTO DEBT- WE SEE THIS ESPECIALLY HAPPENING IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY AND SHOCK. WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE WORKERS LIVE. IN OTHER INSTANCES INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LURED INTO TRAFFICKING HAVE BEEN PROMISED THE MOMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. JOB TRAINING ARE SECURING OF AFFECTS EXCEPT FOR JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES UNFORTUNATELY. SOME INDIVIDUALS TAKE THESE PROMISES OF THE FACE VALUE OF FALLEN TO THE FORCED LABOR IN HOPES OF. MOVING THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILY OUT OF POVERTY. THAT'S WHY AB TWO TWENTY IS A CRITICAL INSURE CAL BILL THIS GUY. TO COMBAT IN THE RETURN IN THE AND TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE NO LONGER EXPLODED IN THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSION WE RECORD DRIVE A- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOSEPH JELLO WITH A NEW H.

BUT ANY ANY COMMENTS OF YOU ALREADY HAVE A MOTION HE COMMENTS THIS IS A MEMBER AWARD CREATE ONE THANK THE AUTHOR- AND THE SPONSORS FOR RAIN FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WORKING ON LABOR TRAFFICKING ISSUES AS PERVASIVE AS THEY ARE IN AS UNDERGROUND AS THEY ARE- IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE ALL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN OUR DISPENSED- ALL EYES AND EARS ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO LOOK FOR THE SIGNS UP TO THAT POINT- AND THANK YOU FOR- YOU KNOW COLLEGE BEING THROUGH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT WE DIRECT THE- PROSECUTORIAL ACTIVITY TO THOSE WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- FOR THIS BILL TO- IT RECEIVE INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE COMPLAINTS AND THAT'S- THAT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- WOULD. ALSO ALLOW CAL OSHA THE ABILITY OF THEIR ON SITE FOR. RUN OUT ROUTINE INSPECTIONS OR FOR OTHER- COMPLAINTS RECTIFY THESE IF THEY ARE. ABLE TO OBSERVE- POTENTIAL- EVIDENCE- OBSERVATIONS THAT THAT LABOR TRAFFICKING MIGHT BE PRACTICES THEN AUTHORIZED THEM TO INITIATE. SOME OF THAT INVESTIGATION. I WILL LET. COMMISSIONER IN- SPEAK BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE NOT- WE ARE NOT- ALLOWING. PROSECUTE PROSECUTION WITH THIS BILL IT'S ONLY INVESTORS RIGHT RIVER FOR THAT PROPERTY YUXIN IS GEARED TO REMAIN BOTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS- THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. RIGHT AND IF IT'S ACTUALLY BUT BUT BEFORE WE GO TO THE COMMISSION ONE ONE TWO ONE CLARIFICATION- THAT. WE ACTUALLY THE COMMITTEE DID NOT ACTUALLY ASK. FOR THE ACCEPTANCE AMENDMENTS BUT WE DID MAKE SUGGESTIONS. THAT AS IF THIS GOES FORWARD IT'LL GO TO PUBLIC SAFETY WE HAVE ASSEMBLY JONES SAWYER WITH US- THE COMMITTEE HERE- AND THE TWO AREAS OF INTEREST- BEFORE CONSIDERATION RAY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'VE- ACCEPTED THE CONSIDERATION OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS- IS THAT. INSTEAD OF IT BEING HOUSES OF THE UNIT BE HELPED. SHEPHERD BE HOUSING POLICY. BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE INVESTIGATORS IF INVESTITORI. TASK FORCES UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TASK FORCES SO. THAT'S MORE THEIR AREA OF FOCUS. AND AS WAS JUST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW- JUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT- YOU KNOW THE THAT. THE UNIT CAN REFER CASES LABOUR TRACTOR TRAFFICKING. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR TO DETAINEES AND THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY SEE FIT. WITH WITH THOSE REFERRALS- AND SERVE WITH THOSE CLARIFICATIONS. HOPEFULLY THOSE THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT LANGUAGE AND ALL THAT. AT PUBLIC SAFETY- IT THIS MAKES IT OVER THERE- AND I. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR STAFF WORKED WITH OURS ON THOSE ISSUES. I WILL ALLOW- COMMISSIONER BUT DIDN'T ON OUT. IT'S THAT- THERE WILL BE A POINT OF CONTACT THAT WERE CREATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AND DOES RELATIONS SO IF OSHA I WERE INTENTIONALLY ENSURING THAT THEY'RE DIRECTING THOSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SO WE CAN THEN INVESTIGATE SO YOU ARE CORRECT IN YOUR STATE FISHER SO ONE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES WE DISCOVERED AS WE WERE HAVING OUR HEARINGS WAS THAT THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED POSSIBLY IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND LABOR TRAFFICKING AND IT WAS THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WAS THEY WERE GOING LIKE THIS. RIGHT THEY WERE MAKING THE CONNECTIONS AND SO ON VICTIMS WOULD FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS THAT WE CAN CENTRALIZE IT A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THAT SOME OF THAT WILL END IT WASN'T THE PEOPLE THAT DEPARTMENT FOLKS WERE INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING RIGHT BUT DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR WORKLOAD WAS WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY RIGHT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO BE THE ONES TO START SOMETHING AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND SO. THAT'S ONE OF THE WHAT WHY WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION COULD YOU PUT IT SOMEWHERE TECHNIC SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE SO THAT THAT KIND OF THE MISHAPS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN RIGHT THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT RESEARCH FROM THE COMMISSION STANDPOINT AS WELL BRING IN THE- YOU KNOW FOUNDATION FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT'LL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE- HAPPY TO I THINK THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND I'LL BE HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTING IT AS WELL AS IMPACTED AS COLD CAL OSHA IS WITH ITS- WIDE RANGE OF RESPONSIBILITIES. IN THIS IS I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND THAT AS WELL THAT WOULD BE A. BUDGET CONVERSATION. THANK THANK YOU SUMMARY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK THAT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE THINK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING YOU'RE RIGHT COMMISSIONER WERE ONLY THINKING OF SEX TRAFFICKING AS OPPOSED TO LABOR TRAFFIC I ALSO HAVE A BILL IN THIS IN THIS SPACE AND IN LIGHT OF THAT I WOULD IF YOU WOULD ALLOW IT I WOULD LOVE TO BE LISTED AS A CO AUTHOR OF YOUR BILL. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS YES SOMEONE HAS ALSO DONE DOES THE SPACE IT'S A MEANS FRANKLY HEARTBREAKING- WHAT WHAT WHAT PC SO MANY WORKERS GO THROUGH- UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AND JUST THE WAY THEY'RE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF- IN SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU AND YOUR SPONSORS. FOR TAKING ON BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S ALWAYS A HEAVY LEFT WHEN AND- YOU CREATE THE UNIT THEN IT'S ABOUT A REPLACEMENT AND THAT'S WHERE WE START GETTING PUSHED BACK RIGHT. IN BUT TO PUT I THINK IT'S A VERY SMART MOVE TO GO IN THIS DIRECTION ACTUALLY. FORMALLY CREATE A UNIT- DESIGNED FOR IDENTIFYING THIS KIND OF ABUSE. I WOULD ALSO. LIKE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS- WE DO HAVE A MOTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CARILLO SECONDED BY SOME AREAS.

WHEN YOU AND YOU AND YOUR AND WITNESSES ARE READY TO GO FEEL FREE TO BE IN TESTING ALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS FINE AFTERNOON. THIS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE IT SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT ON HAUL TRUCK DRIVERS WHO BRING THE TAYLOR WHO BRING- SOME MATERIALS TO A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT SITE FOR PAVING GRADING AND FILL. THAT THEY'RE PAID- A PREVAILING WAGE WHICH IS ALREADY THE CASE FOR OFF PAUL TRUCKING WORK NO EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT ALL WORKERS ON A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT BE PAID- A PREVAILING WAGE JUST LAST SUMMER A SERIES OF CAL OF- THE SUPREME SINCE THE SUPREME COURT. SOME DECISIONS HERE IN OUR STATE CALIFORNIA INJECTED SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER ON HAUL TRUCKING WORK QUALIFIES FOR A PREVAILING WAGE. AGAIN OFF ALL TRUCK DRIVERS WHO PERFORM SIMILAR WORK TO ON HALL TRUCK DRIVERS ARE ON AND BIG USUALLY COVERED UNDER THE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS IN LABOR CODE SECTION ONE SEVEN TWO ZERO POINT THREE. THE CLEARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER CERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER ON HAUL TRUCK DRIVERS ARE COVERED. UNDER THIS LABOR CODE SECTION MOVING FORWARD- SO THIS LEGISLATION WILL SIMPLY CLARIFY THAT A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT INCLUDES THE TRUCKING OF MATERIALS FOR PAVING GRADING TO FILL BOTH TO AND FROM. THE PROJECT SITE FOR PURPOSES OF THE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW ON A PERSONAL NOTE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY TRUCK DRIVERS IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT SUCH AS YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

AND FROM THE SIDE OF CONSTRUCTION. IS COVERED AT THAT POINT. MR BROADEST CERTAINLY MENTION THE TRILOGY WASN'T THE STAR WARS TRILOGY BUT IT WAS ANOTHER TRILOGY. THAT TOSSED SOME OF THIS INTO QUESTION AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE HERE IS PEOPLE THAT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WERE DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAULING MATERIALS FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS ARE NOW BEING. REGULATED BACK TO SOME SUB CLASS KNOWN AS THEY'RE JUST DRIVERS. THESE ARE MEN AND WOMEN HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SAFELY PERFORM THE WORK NECESSARY IN GETTING MATERIALS TO AND FROM PUBLIC WORKSITE. THEY'RE NOT BEING PAID WORK- WITHOUT PREVAILING WAGE RATES THEIR WAGES ARE ALWAYS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX THIS WILL ADD SOME STABILITY TO THE WORLD AND WELL ACTUALLY SAID SOME STABILITY TO THE PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU WON'T SEE THE POTENTIAL ISSUES WHERE YOU'VE SEEN IN SOME OTHER AREAS NORTH OF THE BORDER WHERE THE WAGE RATES AND WHAT NOT COULD BE CALLED INTO QUESTION.

AT THIS TIME THEY'RE NOT FOR LINES IN Q. THANK YOU- OKAY OPPOSITION. YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE TODD BLOOM SIGN FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF FIRSTLY I'D LIKE TO STATE I RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO PROVIDE A BETTER WAGE A BETTER LIFE FOR YOUR MEMBERS I TRULY APPRECIATE THAT- S. C. C. A. AS IN ALL UNION ASSOCIATION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING CONTRACTORS OTHER OPPOSED TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE TO BE CLEAR SCCA IS NOT OPPOSED TO HIGHER WAGES. SEC'S SCCA MEMBERS PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES A LIVING WAGE THE MASTER LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR AN OPERATING ENGINEER AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE STARTS AT FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR- ADDITIONALLY CONTRACTORS PAY AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR A FOR HEALTH WELFARE AND PENSION BENEFITS OF ITS EIGHTY DOLLARS PER HOUR FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL OFFERING A- OPERATING ENGINEER. THE ISSUE FOR SCCA IS NOT THE WAGE THE ISSUE IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONTRACTOR AND SUPPLIER. THE CONTRACTOR HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE LABOR CONDITIONS CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLIER BUT THE APPLICATION OF A PUBLIC WORK FOR THIS SERVICE TRIGGERS THE POTENTIAL LABOR CODE LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID WAGES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A CONTRACTOR AND THE SUPPLIER IS NOT A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT IT IS A PURCHASE ORDER. SCCA RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE FOR THAT REASON THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PHILIP IF WENT THIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE IN MY APOLOGIES TO THE AUTHOR WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION FORMALIZED YET OR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WILL GET TOGETHER TOMORROW BUT WE'RE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT WILL BE OPPOSING THIS MEASURE AS WELL. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE- TODD BLUE SIGN- WE ARE THE MAJORITY IN OUR CASE MAJORITY UNIONIZED CONTRACTOR ASSOCIATION WE BUILD ALL YOUR HEAVY HIGHWAY CIVIL UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT MADE BY MR BLOOM SIGN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONTRACTOR AND THE SUPPLIER. WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THESE EMPLOYEES UP BUT ANOTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM OUR CONTRACTORS IS THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES WHERE CONTRACT. AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE GOALS SET BY THE LEGISLATURE AND IN MANY OF THESE BIDS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT IS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SO IF WE START IN ADVERT ONLY PUSHING THAT SUPPLY CHAIN TO A PLACE WHERE IT'S NO LONGER INDEPENDENT BUSINESS WE ARE VERY SMALL RECOURSE IN ORDER TO SATISFY THAT REQUIREMENT SO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE BUT I WILL. FORMALIZE OUR OPINION FOR YOU TOMORROW THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPPOSITION. MORE GO HEAD TO THE PHONES THIS MODERATOR AND WE'RE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE.

REGARDS TO A HI THERE DISADVANTAGE BUSINESS ENTITIES- AND YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT DOES THIS FOCUS ON PROJECTS IN WOULD ARGUE THAT LIFTING THE PREVAILING WAGE WOULD NOT IMPACT THEIR STATUS AS A D. B. E. IT MAY HOWEVER RAISE WAGES FOR THEM. I'M WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A GOOD THING SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SCRATCHING OUR HEADS A LITTLE BIT AT THAT ONE- STEVE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE. A POINT HI TO MISTER BLOOM STEIN'S COMMENTS ABOUT GENERAL LIABILITY. MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT. THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS TALKS ABOUT SUPPLIERS OR ACTUAL TRANSPORTERS OKAY THE TRANSPORTERS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN THE DRIVE AND OPERATE THE VEHICLES TO BRING THE MATERIALS EITHER FROM A SOURCE OR TO A SOURCE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SUPPLIER THAT ACTUALLY TAKES MATERIAL OUT OF THE GROUND WERE FORMULATES IT AT A BATCH PLANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING THE TRUCKS.

SO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS LETTER HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR A BI NINETEEN FORTY NINE THE BEREAVEMENT LEAVE ACT I AM YVONNE TRIES A SURVIVOR MOTHER GRANDMOTHER COMMUNITY MEMBER AND THE FOUNDER OF THE MOTHER'S VOICE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST CHILREN TO GUN VIOLENCE. I'M SADDENED BY THE FACT THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND CARE FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES TO VIOLENCE I LOST MY SON ON AUGUST TWENTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DUE TO HIM BEING MURDERED. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT SOMEONE SO CLOSE TO ME WAS KILLED AND THIS WASN'T JUST ANY PERSON IT WAS MY BABY THIS WAS A TRULY SCARY TIME FOR MY FAMILY AND I PARTLY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO KILLED HIM AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS MURDERED. I TRIED% MY BEST TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER THREE DAYS HOWEVER THE PAIN AND TRAUMA CAUSED ME TO START DECIDING AND DEPRESSION YOU SEE I WAS ONLY GIVEN THREE DAYS OFF OF WORK AT THE TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD TAKE FOURTEEN DAYS TO GET HIS BODY BACK FROM THE CORONER'S OFFICE. AND MORE TIME TO FOCUS ON FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS IT IS SO HARD TO FOCUS WHEN TRYING TO BURY YOUR CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER AFTER THREE DAYS THE HEALING PROCESS HAD NOT STARTED AT A- THIS POINT. I WAS FULLY ENGAGED IN THE TRAUMA AND I LOST MY JOB. SO NOW NOT ONLY DID I STILL HAVE TO BURY MY CHILD BUT I ALSO HAD TO FIND A WAY TO CONTINUE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING MYSELF. AND MY FAMILY. I SUPPORT AND PRAY THAT YOU PASS THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE A RIGHT TO UNPAID BEREAVEMENT LEAVE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE WORKERS WITH THE BASIC LEVEL OF PROTECTION DURING A MOMENT OF IMMENSE HARDSHIP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND- I JUST WANT TO THINK IS THE ONLY MEMBER LOW FOR YOUR DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE THIS IS WHY OUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE SO DEDICATED TO THIS. THIS ISSUE AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY THESE HEARTBREAKING STORIES ARE TOO COMMON- THAT WE HEAR FROM. AND THIS LEAVE LAW FILLS A CRITICAL GAP THAT WE HAVE AND WE HAVE LEAVE LAWS THAT ALLOW WORKERS TO TAKE LEAVE TO CARE FOR. SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBERS BUT THEN AS SOON AS A FAMILY MEMBER PASSES AWAY. THE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT LEAVE ENDS. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOOD EMPLOYERS THAT DO PROVIDE BEREAVEMENT LEAVE BUT- WE THINK EVERY WORKER SHOULD HAVE HAVE THIS RIGHT TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF DURING THIS. IMMENSELY HARD TIME IN THEIR LIFE- SO FAR THAT- YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I DO I THINK THE AUTHORS SPONSORS FOR THE FLEXIBILITY REGARDING WITNESS HAS FINALLY REVERTED BACK TO IN PERSON AND- SO.

I JUST CAN'T QUITE GET ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP YOU ON THIS- BUT THAT THAT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS ISSUES IS- CLEARLY THIS IS FOR FIVE DAYS OF BEREAVEMENT LEAVE BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDES THREE. SO SHOULD THERE BE A CONSISTENCY IN ACTION NOT JUST FOR PRIVATE BUSINESSES BUT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALL ITS IN A DEBATE OVER PIECE- OR- IS DOING BUSINESS WITH SHOULD THAT NOT BE A REQUIREMENT THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE. ENTIRETY OF THE SYSTEM THE SECOND IS. CAN THERE BE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SOME CLARIFICATION OR MAYBE STE. STRICTLY NOT STRICT STRAIGHT DIRECTION THAT WOULD HELP. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT ARE CREATED BECAUSE THERE CAN BE AMBIGUITY IN THIS BILL. WHERE SOMEBODY MAY NOT INTERPRET. OUR FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN HARMED WHEN IN FACT THEY REALLY HAVEN'T REALLY HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO. REALLY STYMIE THAT SO THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHILE THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT EMPLOYERS THE FOR OR LESS IT DOESN'T. AFFECT THOSE AFTER THAT AND THAT THAT COULD BE VERY. DAMAGING TO THEM AND THEIR BOTTOM LINE IN FACT ME PUTTING OUT OF BUSINESS SO. MAYBE AS IT WAS FOR YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADDRESS. I FIND MYSELF WHERE I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT YEAH AND I'M UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THOSE THAT THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL EMPLOYERS INCLUDING PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS. AND IT IT DOESN'T SAY THAT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S WHY I OKAY.
