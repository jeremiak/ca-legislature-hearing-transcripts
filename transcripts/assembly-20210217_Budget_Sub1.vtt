00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:18.796 region:rollup2
THE PRIORITY LIST THAN OTHER

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:20.498 region:rollup2
COUNTIES- AND SO WE WANT TO

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.900 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALSO HAVING

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:23.568 region:rollup2
THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.503 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY PARTNERS TRACKING.

00:38:23.568 --> 00:38:27.639 region:rollup2
THE AVAILABILITY SO WE CAN MAKE

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:34.479 region:rollup2
SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE OUT

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:36.414 region:rollup2
QUICKLY I'M TO GET THOSE- AND

00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:37.482 region:rollup2
BAXEEN. SO IT DOES ALL- KIND OF

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:38.516 region:rollup2
CONCERN- THAT WE DO HAVE THAT

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:40.451 region:rollup2
REMAIN WHILE WE NOW KNOW WHO

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:42.654 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW. WHEN WE NEED TO

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:43.254 region:rollup2
KNOW WE NEED TO REALLY DEFINE

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:46.958 region:rollup2
KIND OF THAT ACCESS IN THAT

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:48.026 region:rollup2
HOUSE- SO THIS REALLY WELL THE

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:49.661 region:rollup2
PLANS OF THE THINGS THE STEPS

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:50.895 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING TO GO FORWARD

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.430 region:rollup2
REALLY DO ADDRESS THE ISSUES

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:54.265 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS. LIKE I

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.834 region:rollup2
SAID THE AVAILABILITY OF A

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:57.635 region:rollup2
VACCINES IS A CONCERN WE WANT

00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:59.304 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:00.738 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THOSE CONSUMERS

00:38:59.304 --> 00:39:02.674 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY THAT HAVE THE

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:03.975 region:rollup2
GREATEST REST BASED ON THEIR

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:05.510 region:rollup2
HEALTH CONDITIONS SO THOSE

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:07.879 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HIGHLY

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.881 region:rollup2
COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS- ANY

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:11.616 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL THAT IS. AND A RISK

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
AREA AS FAR AS EVEN BEING ABLE

00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:17.188 region:rollup2
TO GET ACCESS TO- A SITE OR WHO

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:18.623 region:rollup2
IS UNABLE TO GO TO A SITE- WE

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:20.525 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME

00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:22.360 region:rollup2
VERY REMOTE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:24.329 region:rollup2
THAT HAD VERY LIMITED INTERNET

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.231 region:rollup2
ACCESS. I'M SO WE WANT THE

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:28.499 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS TO WORK WITH-

00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:29.634 region:rollup2
CARE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS TO

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:32.203 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:33.104 region:rollup2
OUTREACH EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.507 region:rollup2
BEHIND- IN THE DIRECTIVE WE'VE

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.209 region:rollup2
ASKED THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:39.377 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE CONTACTS WE KNOW

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:41.546 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR COORDINATORS VERY

00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:43.348 region:rollup2
TIRED. EVEN ALSO WORKING VERY

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:45.250 region:rollup2
HARD ALONG WITH THE PROVIDERS

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:46.618 region:rollup2
AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHAT WE NEED

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.353 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE GAS

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:49.354 region:rollup2
PEDAL- SO WE'VE ASKED THE

00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:50.822 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS TO THINK

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:52.357 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR STAFFING TO MAKE

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:54.158 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEY USE ALL THEIR

00:39:52.357 --> 00:39:55.994 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:57.395 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS I REACH. AND THEN

00:39:55.994 --> 00:39:59.464 region:rollup2
ALSO PARTNER WITH THEIR SERVICE

00:39:57.395 --> 00:40:01.299 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:03.167 region:rollup2
REACH SO WE CAN HAVE TIMELY AND

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:03.668 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE OUTREACH TO ADDRESS

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:06.271 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES THAT I JUST

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:07.772 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED- ON THE ADDITIONAL

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:09.574 region:rollup2
AREA THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:11.276 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUSINESS INFORMATION. WE

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:14.078 region:rollup2
ARE STILL HEARING FROM SOME

00:40:11.276 --> 00:40:15.914 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FEAR. OF HAVING THE

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:18.316 region:rollup2
VACCINE I JUST HEARD YESTERDAY

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:19.617 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WAS AFRAID TO- TAKE

00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:20.218 region:rollup2
THE VACCINE BECAUSE THEY

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:22.587 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE

00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:24.322 region:rollup2
THEIR DNA. AND SO WE NEED TO

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:25.623 region:rollup2
GET THE INFORMATION OUT WE ALSO

00:40:24.322 --> 00:40:27.525 region:rollup2

00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:14.752 region:rollup2
HOME LEARNING THERE MAY BE

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:16.487 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE. ARE

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:18.623 region:rollup2
REALLY ADDING STRESS TO YOU ON

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:19.757 region:rollup2
THAT SITUATION- WE HAVE

00:44:18.623 --> 00:44:22.693 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HERE FACILITIES AND

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:24.028 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SERVICES- THAT IS

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:25.429 region:rollup2
ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION WE DID

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:27.832 region:rollup2
SEE A DECREASE AND

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:29.267 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SO ON

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:30.601 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION RELATED TO WHAT

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:32.603 region:rollup2
ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:34.539 region:rollup2
SEEING KIND OF THOSE IMPACTS-

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:36.707 region:rollup2
WE DID SEE A DECREASE IN

00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:38.075 region:rollup2
CLAIMING BY SOME OF OUR SERVICE

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:40.178 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND THERE'S A

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:41.579 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC QUESTION ASKING US.

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:43.981 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE IMPACT

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:45.750 region:rollup2
YOU- THOSE PROVIDERS ENOUGH AND

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.051 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GET TO THAT PORTION OF

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.720 region:rollup2
THE AGENDA WHICH I THINK IS A

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:52.356 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LATER- ALL MAKE SURE

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.759 region:rollup2
THAT WE ADDRESS THAT-

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:56.227 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THAT THERE IS A

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:56.994 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT FACTORS ARE

00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:59.030 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING CASELOAD

00:44:56.994 --> 00:45:00.831 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS I'M THIS IS A

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:07.572 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT- WE

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:09.173 region:rollup2
START EARLY ON A VERY QUICK.

00:45:07.572 --> 00:45:10.041 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN OUR EARLY START AND-

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:12.176 region:rollup2
FOR. SERVICES BUT PRIMARILY-

00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:13.578 region:rollup2
EARLY START. DECLINE AND- THIS

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.545 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT KIDS WHO ARE AT RISK.

00:45:13.578 --> 00:45:16.480 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE GETTING THE SERVICES

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:18.316 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEED SO WE HAVE

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.483 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:21.686 region:rollup2
DO IMMEDIATE OUR REACH WE

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:23.387 region:rollup2
CONNECTED WITH ALL OF OUR EARLY

00:45:21.686 --> 00:45:25.823 region:rollup2
START CONTACTS AND HAD. VERY

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.791 region:rollup2
FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS AND-

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:28.659 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL

00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.561 region:rollup2
CENTERS- WE ALSO DEVELOP

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:31.796 region:rollup2
GROCERS WE REALLY DID-

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:33.264 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH WE ARE

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:35.733 region:rollup2
SEEING AN INCREASE IN THOSE

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:36.968 region:rollup2
INTAKES BUT WE- WE ARE STILL-

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.803 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT BEHIND SO VERY

00:45:36.968 --> 00:45:40.671 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AND HOW THAT AND-

00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:41.706 region:rollup2
INFLUENCES THE ESTIMATE THAT WE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.773 region:rollup2
HAVE FOR BUDGET YEAR WITH

00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:45.977 region:rollup2
CASELOAD AND REGIONAL CENTER

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:47.345 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS- IS. IS RELATED TO

00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:50.982 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANT TO SHARE RIGHT NOW.

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:53.484 region:rollup2
SO IN CURRENT YEAR SO- THIS

00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:56.721 region:rollup2
YEAR CASELOAD WAS UPDATED TO BE

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:57.321 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN

00:45:56.721 --> 00:45:58.656 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT NINETEEN WHICH

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:02.793 region:rollup2
IS AND I NOT DECREASE OF WHAT

00:45:58.656 --> 00:46:03.361 region:rollup2
WE HAD ESTIMATED. EIGHT

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:05.663 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE THIRTY FOUR OF

00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:09.667 region:rollup2
WHICH FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN

00:46:05.663 --> 00:46:10.301 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE IS RELATED. ISSUE

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.469 region:rollup2
OUR ESTIMATE AN EARLY START. SO

00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:13.838 region:rollup2
WE TAKE A AT OUR BYYEAR. WE

00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:14.905 region:rollup2
ARE WE ARE ESTIMATING HIGH IN

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:17.074 region:rollup2
THE SENSE OF WHAT OUR

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:18.943 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL ART TREND OF YEAR

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:20.044 region:rollup2
OVER YEAR GROWTH WITH CASELOAD.

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:21.345 region:rollup2
WE ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'VE

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:24.181 region:rollup2
BEEN TRAINING TRAINING OVER THE

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:26.951 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS- SO WE DO

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:29.520 region:rollup2
HAVE PROJECTED A CASELOAD OF

00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:30.087 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.322 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:33.457 region:rollup2
ONE WHICH IS INCREASE OF JUST

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:35.459 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY ABOVE TWENTY EIGHT

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:37.228 region:rollup2
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. ON AND

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:39.797 region:rollup2
WELL. WE WOULD THINK THAT

00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:41.699 region:rollup2
FUNDING WOULD I'M ACTUALLY NOT

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:43.634 region:rollup2
BE WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:45.036 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ADJUSTED DOWN IN

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:47.471 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO AN ADJUSTMENT TO

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:49.206 region:rollup2
CASELOAD- BUT WE DIDN'T DO THAT

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:51.375 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:53.177 region:rollup2
REALLY- A PRIORITY TO RECOVERY

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:55.012 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA. WE WANT TO MAKE

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.147 region:rollup2
SURE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:57.481 region:rollup2
RECOVERY DURING THE PUBLIC

00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:59.850 region:rollup2
HEALTH CRISIS THAT THE REGIONAL

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:01.485 region:rollup2
CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.287 region:rollup2
DO THOSE AND TAKES SO IF WE

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:05.189 region:rollup2
WERE TO PARALLEL THE REDUCTION

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:06.357 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE CASE LOAD. YES

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:08.626 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT CHANGE REALLY THE

00:47:06.357 --> 00:47:09.593 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS OPERATIONS-

00:47:08.626 --> 00:47:11.762 region:rollup2
AND WANTED TO CONTINUE TO

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:14.165 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE AND NOT DELAY IN

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:16.901 region:rollup2
TAKING AND BRINGING KIDS. IN

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:18.769 region:rollup2
WAS IMPORTANT AND A PRIORITY TO

00:47:16.901 --> 00:47:20.571 region:rollup2
US- SO THAT WAS THE END OF THE

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:22.373 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE LISTED-

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:26.644 region:rollup2
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:47:22.373 --> 00:47:30.614 region:rollup2

REFERENCES ARE FOR TODAY'S

00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:47.231 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. OF COURSE ANY

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:51.001 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT DATA

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:51.836 region:rollup2
INVOLVES A FEW CABBIE OUT SO I.

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:54.004 region:rollup2
LIKE TO START WITH JUST A FEW

00:47:51.836 --> 00:47:55.773 region:rollup2
OF THOSE. ARE I HAVE BEEN

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:57.908 region:rollup2
ASKING THE AGENDA TO TALK A

00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:59.310 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRANS. WELL

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:00.745 region:rollup2
TRAINS ARE COUNCIL CASES AND

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.947 region:rollup2
DEATHS AND THEY CREATE

00:48:00.745 --> 00:48:04.982 region:rollup2
TRAMLINES OVER TIME- BUT I WANT

00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:06.283 region:rollup2
TO CALL OUT TO THE AN IMPORTANT

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:09.253 region:rollup2
FACTOR NOT CAPTURED BY THE

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:13.057 region:rollup2
TREND WOULD BE- DISCUSSION OF A

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:15.926 region:rollup2
RATE OF. CASES EMBRACE OF DEATH

00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:16.961 region:rollup2
IN THE POPULATION AND- AS YOU

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:20.297 region:rollup2
NOTED IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY

00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:21.766 region:rollup2
REMARKS ON OUR OUR POPULATION

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:23.701 region:rollup2
HAS SEEN A HIGHER RATE THAN THE

00:48:21.766 --> 00:48:26.403 region:rollup2
GENERAL POPULATION OF BOTH.

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:27.938 region:rollup2
CASES AND DEATHS ON THEIR END

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:29.306 region:rollup2
AS WELL EXPLAINED IN A MINUTE

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:31.142 region:rollup2
WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:33.944 region:rollup2
OUR DATA IS UNDER REPORTED

00:48:31.142 --> 00:48:40.351 region:rollup2
AFTER REASONS- THAT THAT WILL

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:41.519 region:rollup2
COVER. OF COURSE. ALL ALL OF

00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:42.853 region:rollup2
THAT- IT WAS ADDRESSED TO BUY

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:45.523 region:rollup2
THEIR BAR MINISTRY ABOUT THAT

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:47.191 region:rollup2
WAS PRIOR. OF OUR POPULAR FOR

00:48:45.523 --> 00:48:49.226 region:rollup2
VACCINATION I GET GIVEN THE

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:51.562 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED.

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:52.096 region:rollup2
WELL THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:54.231 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OR SO

00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:55.1000 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ARE IN OUR POPULATION

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:57.501 region:rollup2
JUST OVER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:48:55.1000 --> 00:48:59.270 region:rollup2
OF THEM RECEIVE DIRECT CARE FOR

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:01.272 region:rollup2
THE STATE- WELL THAT'S

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.439 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN ADDITION

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:04.508 region:rollup2
TO THOSE THAT WE DIRECTLY

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:07.411 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S HAVE DIRECT ACCESS

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:09.480 region:rollup2
TO DATA FOR. ABOUT 85% OF OUR

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:12.349 region:rollup2
POPULATION LIVES IN FAMILY

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:14.885 region:rollup2
HOMES ANOTHER 15% OR SO LIVE IN

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:16.787 region:rollup2
LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES.

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:18.823 region:rollup2
ALL THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:20.191 region:rollup2
IN MIND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY FOR

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:21.759 region:rollup2
THOSE WE CARE DIRECTLY FOR WE

00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:24.094 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY HAVE ACCESS TO DATA

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:26.063 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEM. BUT IT'S ONLY THREE

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:27.765 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PEOPLE. WELL AS YOU

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:29.433 region:rollup2
DAHLE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES

00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:32.403 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO REPORT

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:33.871 region:rollup2
BOTH CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
DEATHS AND WERE THEREFORE

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:38.209 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT OF THAT DATA. BUT

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:40.578 region:rollup2
AGAIN ONLY ABOUT 15% OF OUR

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:43.647 region:rollup2
TOTAL POPULATION IS IN SUCH A

00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:45.783 region:rollup2
FACILITY- FOR FAMILIES. WELL

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:47.351 region:rollup2
THE LAW ONLY REQUIRES THE

00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:49.253 region:rollup2
REPORTING OF THE GAS. AND

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.721 region:rollup2
THERE'S OFTEN AN UNDERSTANDABLE

00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:52.490 region:rollup2
I DELAY IN REPORTING OF THAT

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:55.226 region:rollup2
BASS AS FAMILIES GO THROUGH THE

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.695 region:rollup2
GRIEVING PROCESS. SO FOR

00:49:55.226 --> 00:50:01.465 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CLIENTS.

00:49:57.695 --> 00:50:04.235 region:rollup2
OR CONSUMERS IN OUR COMMUNITY-

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:06.570 region:rollup2
WE OFTEN- RELY ONLY ON WHAT WE

00:50:04.235 --> 00:50:08.672 region:rollup2
ARE. ABOUT REGIONAL CENTERS NOW

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.608 region:rollup2
OR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NOW OR

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:13.077 region:rollup2
WHAT A FAMILY VOLUNTARILY

00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:14.712 region:rollup2
REPORTS TO US- THAT'S NOT AN

00:50:13.077 --> 00:50:16.680 region:rollup2
EXCUSE AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:18.082 region:rollup2
THAT WE MANDATE A CHANGE OR NOT

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.450 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:50:18.082 --> 00:50:21.352 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION ON

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:24.722 region:rollup2
THE DEVICE. THE DATA AVAILABLE

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:26.657 region:rollup2
TO US. AS A RESULT OF COURSE-

00:50:24.722 --> 00:50:28.225 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT. WE HAVE SOME

00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:30.494 region:rollup2
UNDER REPORTING IN OUR DATA

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:31.795 region:rollup2
FROM THE FAMILY HOMES AND IT'S

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:33.631 region:rollup2
A LARGE A CHUNK OF OUR

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:35.432 region:rollup2
CASELOAD. ALTHOUGH THAT UNDER

00:50:33.631 --> 00:50:36.534 region:rollup2
REPORTING IS GENERALLY WHAT WE

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:42.940 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK OF THIS CONSISTENT

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:44.141 region:rollup2
OVER. TIME THEY CAN'T BE

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.610 region:rollup2
MEASURE- BUT IT IS THERE FOR

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:48.012 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE STORAGE TRY IN OUR- IT

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.979 region:rollup2
DOES OR THERE ARE. IT APPEAR

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:50.814 region:rollup2
THAT THE RATE OF OUR ARE

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:52.850 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL. MAYBE LOWER THE THEY

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:54.051 region:rollup2
OUT ARE AND I WAS IN AND FACTOR

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:59.023 region:rollup2
AS WELL IN THE PRIORITIZATION

00:50:54.051 --> 00:51:01.525 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION FOR VACCINATION. ON

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:03.827 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY AND I'LL TALK MORE

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:05.829 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON IN

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:07.865 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS WELL IT'S

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:10.267 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO FLYING TO THAT- IN

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:12.436 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO OUR FAMILY IS NOT

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:14.505 region:rollup2
BEING REQUIRED TO REPORT CASES

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITALIZATION THERE'S NO

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:18.542 region:rollup2
MANDATE ACROSS OUR POPULATION

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
TO REPORT VACCINATIONS EITHER

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:22.746 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WHEN YOU COMPOUND

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:24.248 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S AN INTERPLAY WHICH

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:27.117 region:rollup2
ALSO CONSUMER CONSENT TO

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:28.986 region:rollup2
VACCINATION ITSELF INTO THE

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:31.355 region:rollup2
DATA SHARING ASSOCIATED WITH IT

00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:32.790 region:rollup2
WELL AND THE VARIOUS ACCESS

00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:35.159 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE TO

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:36.627 region:rollup2
VACCINATION. WELL AND THE TIME

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.629 region:rollup2
WIDE POTENTIALLY IN THAT

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:40.264 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:41.131 region:rollup2
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY

00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:43.233 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO HAVE

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:45.035 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT WHO'S

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:50.541 region:rollup2
BEEN VACCINATED WELL WHERE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:52.409 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN VACCINATED SIDE OF.

00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:54.011 region:rollup2
FACTS AND SO FORTH. I'M HOWEVER.

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:55.679 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT IN THE DATA

00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:57.748 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE TRACKING OF

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:59.283 region:rollup2
TRENDS REALLY ALLOWS US. TO

00:51:57.748 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:04.188 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. AUTHOR

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.990 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE VAST MAJORITY

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:08.292 region:rollup2
IN IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:09.727 region:rollup2
OF NEW CALVET CASES ARE NOW

00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:11.362 region:rollup2
BEING IDENTIFIED IN IN

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:13.263 region:rollup2

AVAILABLE THIS GIVES US SOME

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:25.609 region:rollup2
ASSURANCE THAT VACCINATION IN

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2

OVERALL STATEWIDE TRENDS THERE

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.363 region:rollup2

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.315 region:rollup2
THE STATEWIDE CASE TREND ON

00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:06.950 region:rollup2
THIS CHART THERE ESSENTIALLY

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:09.053 region:rollup2
MIRRORS OF EACH OTHER THERE WAS

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.921 region:rollup2
A TWO MONTH BOBBLE. BEGINNING

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:12.956 region:rollup2
IN LATE JUNE IN THE SUMMER. AND

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:14.458 region:rollup2
WE SUCCESSFULLY TOGETHER BUILT

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:15.893 region:rollup2
BAD DOCTOR AND THEN YOU SEE THE

YOUR AGENDA THE DISPLAYS CHECK

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:28.372 region:rollup2
TRANSFER BOTH HOSPITALIZATIONS

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:32.943 region:rollup2

00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:34.311 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE SAME. TREND LINES

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:37.581 region:rollup2
BUT- WE'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:38.449 region:rollup2
WITH LOWER OF SIX. LOWER NOW.

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:41.085 region:rollup2
WE WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ABOUT

00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:41.952 region:rollup2
DEVIATIONS- AND AS I'VE SAID

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:44.488 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:46.724 region:rollup2
GENERALLY MIRRORING THE TREND

00:53:44.488 --> 00:53:48.192 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ISN'T- LIVE CHECK TO

00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:50.761 region:rollup2
MONSTER IT TO CALL OUT IN TERMS

00:53:48.192 --> 00:53:52.563 region:rollup2
OF THE DEVIATION AGAIN I WILL

00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:54.298 region:rollup2
FLAG THAT THERE THE RATE OF

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2
BOTH CASES AND ASK FOR OUR

00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:58.335 region:rollup2

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.270 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL RATE OF THE GENERAL

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:03.841 region:rollup2
POPULATION I'M NOT OF COURSE

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.708 region:rollup2
ISN'T REVEALED IN THE TRYING TO

00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:07.478 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S WORTH. KEEPING IN MIND.

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:09.413 region:rollup2
ON YOU KNOW OTHERWISE YOU KNOW

00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:11.381 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE SEE OUTCOMES

00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:13.383 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WORSE IN LICENSE

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:14.885 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THEY'VE

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:17.254 region:rollup2
BEEN WORSE FOR OLDER PEOPLE

00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:18.956 region:rollup2
THAN FOR OTHERS AND OBVIOUSLY

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:21.458 region:rollup2
WORSE FOR PEOPLE WITH MORE

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:24.361 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED UNDERLYING MEDICAL

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:26.697 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS- I DO WANT TO FLAG

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:28.065 region:rollup2
ON. AND SHOULD THE CHART ON

00:54:26.697 --> 00:54:31.101 region:rollup2
PAGE EIGHT TRILLION CONTAINS

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:32.769 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON- IT'S

RIGHT BELOW THE GRAPH THAT I

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:38.142 region:rollup2
WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT ONE YOU

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:39.610 region:rollup2
WILL SEE- THAT THE- COVERED

00:54:38.142 --> 00:54:41.979 region:rollup2
CASES OF GENERALLY ON A

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.614 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC BASIS. WHILE ON AN

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:47.751 region:rollup2
ETHNIC BASIS I'VE BEEN

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:50.020 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONAL. OUR OVERALL

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:51.955 region:rollup2

THAT IS FOR WHITE CONSUMERS

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:56.593 region:rollup2
WERE FOR CODED CASES THEY'VE

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:59.396 region:rollup2
BEEN ABOUT 40% OF TOTAL CASES

00:54:56.593 --> 00:55:01.865 region:rollup2
BUT ONLY 30% OF OUR POPULATION.

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:02.1000 region:rollup2
WELL THIS IS- ALSO BECAUSE THEY

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.867 region:rollup2
WERE DESPERATE WHITE OR

00:55:02.1000 --> 00:55:05.836 region:rollup2

THAT HAS BEEN ARE HIGHER. AND

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:16.013 region:rollup2
FOR THE SAME REASON DEATHS OF

00:55:13.544 --> 00:55:19.049 region:rollup2
WHITE CONSUMERS ARE 51% OF

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:24.254 region:rollup2

LIMITED SUPPLY OF THE VACCINE

00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:32.256 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO- THE HIGHER RISK

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.491 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH CODE INFRACTION

00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:35.359 region:rollup2
FOR OUR POPULATION ALSO

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:37.828 region:rollup2
REVEALED THAT IS A POSITIVE

00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:39.229 region:rollup2

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.615 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THE FIRST

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.117 region:rollup2
IS TO SHARE INSIGHTS AND

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.985 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES ON TRADE OFFS OF

PRIORITIZING VACCINE FOR THE

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:21.057 region:rollup2
GDS OUR POPULATION. I WON'T

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:24.294 region:rollup2
SPEND LONG ON THIS SINCE- THE

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:27.363 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW EXPANDED

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:29.365 region:rollup2

POPULATION BEGINNING MARCH

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:35.872 region:rollup2
FIFTEENTH. I THINK THE

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:39.876 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS NOW THE QUESTION NOW

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:41.544 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY BE HOW- HOW HOW

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.012 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE HOW THIS NEW

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:45.215 region:rollup2
POLICY WLL BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:47.350 region:rollup2
STRICTER ARJUNAN- ALREADY

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:49.352 region:rollup2
PROVIDED A NUMBER OF-

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:52.989 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCERNS

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:54.758 region:rollup2
THERE- I WOULD JUST ADD A

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:56.459 region:rollup2
COUPLE- WHICH INCLUDE. BUT HOW

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:58.328 region:rollup2
WILL INFORMED CONSENT BE

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.496 region:rollup2
MANAGED AMONG THIS POPULATION

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:01.498 region:rollup2
AND WILL THE PEOPLE

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:02.565 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THE VACCINE BE

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:04.234 region:rollup2
SKILLED AT WORKING WITH

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:06.836 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.904 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES. I'M MOVING TO THE

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.305 region:rollup2
SECOND QUESTION HOW DOES

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.241 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMPARE TO OTHER

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:13.476 region:rollup2
STATES REGARDING THE VACCINE

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:15.812 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZATION FOR THE DDS

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:17.714 region:rollup2
SERVE POPULATION. I'M GOING TO

01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:19.916 region:rollup2
PUT- FRAME THIS IN TERMS OF KEY

01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:22.018 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT STATES HAVE HAD TO

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:25.355 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SO THE FIRST QUESTION

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:27.490 region:rollup2
WOULD BE- WIN WIN HAS A STATE

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:29.526 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO EXPAND THEIR

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:32.262 region:rollup2
PRIORITY LIST TO INCLUDE HIGH

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:34.430 region:rollup2
RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:36.866 region:rollup2
CDC RECOMMENDS INCLUDING THIS

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:39.836 region:rollup2
LIST IN PHASE ONE AND SEE A

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:41.504 region:rollup2
VACCINE- PRIORITIZATION BUT

01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:44.107 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND JUST OVER

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:47.143 region:rollup2
TWENTY- STATES HAVE MOVED TO

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:49.846 region:rollup2
THIS GROUP UP TO AN EARLIER

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:51.681 region:rollup2
PHASE- BUT THE NEXT KEY

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:53.316 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS SORT OF WHAT IS

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:55.685 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THAT LIST OF HIGH

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:59.556 region:rollup2
RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO THE

01:05:55.685 --> 01:06:00.757 region:rollup2
CDC'S LIST- OF HIGH RISK

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:02.659 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS INCLUDES DOWN

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:04.828 region:rollup2
SYNDROME AS STRICTER BRIDGMAN

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:07.330 region:rollup2
HAD MENTIONED- BUT IT DOES NOT

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:08.665 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE OTHER

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.799 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.634 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:13.236 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY A LIVING LIST OF

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:15.371 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AND IT'S DEVELOPED

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:17.307 region:rollup2
BASED ON AVAILABLE RESEARCH SO

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:19.142 region:rollup2
IF A CONDITION IS NOT IN THAT

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.844 region:rollup2
LIST IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:23.313 region:rollup2
IS A HIGH RISK OF SERIOUS

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:24.814 region:rollup2
ILLNESS FROM FROM CODED BUT-

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:28.651 region:rollup2
SIMPLY THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:30.820 region:rollup2
OF RESEARCH ON. THAT PARTICULAR

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:34.324 region:rollup2
CONDITION IN THE COPA CONTEXT

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:36.693 region:rollup2
SO ONCE THE STATE HAS EXPANDED

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:38.328 region:rollup2
ITS PRIORITIZATION TO- INCLUDE

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:39.128 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH HIGH RISK MEDICAL

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:43.466 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THE QUESTION

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:46.569 region:rollup2
BECOMES. DO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND-

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:48.538 region:rollup2
WHO IS ELIGIBLE IS THE LIST-

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:51.307 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD OR IS THE LIST I'M

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:54.611 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC SO CALIFORNIA REALLY

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:56.179 region:rollup2
USED ON THE CDC'S LATEST-

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.714 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF THE CONDITIONS IN

01:06:56.179 --> 01:07:00.116 region:rollup2
THE CDC'S LIST BUT ALSO

01:06:57.714 --> 01:07:01.918 region:rollup2
EXPANDED- THE LIST TO INCLUDE

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:03.419 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:04.687 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO ALLOWS SOME

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:06.222 region:rollup2
DISCRETION BY HEALTH CARE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:08.324 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS- TO MAKE A

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:09.859 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER I'M

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:12.262 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A CONDITION

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:13.897 region:rollup2
THAT CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:15.899 region:rollup2
ILLNESS FROM KOBE. I WE NOTE

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:17.934 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT FIVE OTHER STATES

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:19.402 region:rollup2
FIVE OR SIX OTHER STATES HAVE-

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:21.304 region:rollup2
EXPANDED THEIR LIST OF

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:22.071 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS TO SPECIFICALLY

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:24.040 region:rollup2
INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:27.710 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES. INCLUDING

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.145 region:rollup2

STATES ALSO ALLOW SOME

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:32.649 region:rollup2
DISCRETION BY HEALTH CARE

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:35.718 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS INCLUDING TEXAS

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:37.053 region:rollup2
MONTANA NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:39.255 region:rollup2
THIRD CONSIDERATION WOULD BE

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:42.025 region:rollup2
HOW ARE STATES IMPLEMENTING THE

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:43.760 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THAT'S REALLY- SORT

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:45.962 region:rollup2
OF THE PHASE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.231 region:rollup2
ACT. SO ONE OF THE KEY

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:50.233 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IS MUST MUST

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.668 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.102 region:rollup2
THEIR CONDITION OR IS THE STATE

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:55.772 region:rollup2
GOING TO RELY ON SELF

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:57.273 region:rollup2
ATTESTATION- MOST STATES HAVE

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.975 region:rollup2
NOT INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:02.145 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY SAID HOW THIS IS

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:03.112 region:rollup2
GOING TO WORK. ON IT AND WE

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:05.181 region:rollup2
KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT SEVERAL

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:09.285 region:rollup2
STATES ARE RELYING ON SELF

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:11.521 region:rollup2
ATTESTATION. WESLEY ARE I WOULD

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:13.556 region:rollup2
JUST MENTION- STATES HAVE THE

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:15.291 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO MAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:17.593 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMMODATE THE POPULATION I

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:20.196 region:rollup2
JUST PROVIDE ONE EXAMPLE- THE

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:21.497 region:rollup2
STATE OF OREGON- NOT ONLY

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:23.499 region:rollup2
INCLUDED DEVELOPMENTAL

DISABILITIES IN ITS PHASE ONE

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:28.671 region:rollup2
AS SO REALLY IN ITS FIRST-

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:30.807 region:rollup2
FIRST PHASE A VACCINE-

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:32.475 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION BUT IT ALSO. HAS

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:34.077 region:rollup2
DONE SOME INTERESTING THINGS

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:36.112 region:rollup2
LIKE CREATING A MOBILE DRIVE

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:39.549 region:rollup2
THROUGH AT THE PORTLAND-

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:41.150 region:rollup2
AIRPORT THAT ACCOMMODATES-

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.185 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:44.620 region:rollup2
QUESTION WE WERE ASKED TO

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:46.489 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO IT CONCERNS OR

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.491 region:rollup2
OBSERVATIONS ON OTHER FISCAL

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:50.159 region:rollup2
POLICY DYNAMICS IN CO BID FOR

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:52.962 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WANT TO SUBCOMMITTEE

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:55.264 region:rollup2
TO BE AWARE. I'M I'M JUST GOING

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
TO NAME A FEW EXAMPLES HERE- IN

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:58.868 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT THE PANDEMIC

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:01.037 region:rollup2
HAS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:03.106 region:rollup2
FOR BETTER DATA SYSTEMS IN THE-

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:04.641 region:rollup2
IN THE DDS SYSTEM. THIS IS

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:06.876 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN A LONG STANDING L.

01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:08.111 region:rollup2
A. RECOMMENDATION- BUT THE

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.013 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT SOME OF

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:11.614 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES- TO THE FOR

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:13.983 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:17.720 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS HAVING TO RELY ON

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:19.922 region:rollup2
SORT OF A MAKE SHIFT- PROVIDER

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.757 region:rollup2
REPORTING SORT OF SYSTEM THàNH

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:24.761 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT BILLING WILL

01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:27.797 region:rollup2
HAPPEN- IT'S ALSO. SOMEWHAT

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:30.133 region:rollup2
HARD TO RUN- SORT OF REAL TIME

01:09:27.797 --> 01:09:32.301 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS ON THE CAPACITY OF

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:35.204 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDER NETWORK OR ON ON

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:37.306 region:rollup2
WHAT- INDIVIDUALS. THE

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:40.443 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL SERVED ARE IN NEED

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:43.012 region:rollup2
OF- BUT ALSO MENTION IT BUT

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:45.148 region:rollup2
THEY- BARGE MEN HAVE ALREADY

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED- ENROLLMENT BUT THAT

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:49.619 region:rollup2
HAS BOTH FISCAL AND POLICY

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:51.154 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS. I'LL TALK ABOUT

01:09:49.619 --> 01:09:53.189 region:rollup2
THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS IN A

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:55.324 region:rollup2
MOMENT BUT POLICY WISE- THE

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.825 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR NOTED SOME OF THE

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.894 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THEY'VE MADE TO

01:09:55.825 --> 01:10:00.630 region:rollup2
MITIGATE. THE EFFECTS OF

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:03.1000 region:rollup2
DECLINING- ENROLLMENT IN THE

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:05.268 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. AND BUT WE WOULD JUST

01:10:03.1000 --> 01:10:07.670 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THIS IS THE SIXTH

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:12.708 region:rollup2
SENSE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LIMITED

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:13.743 region:rollup2
AND- THIS CAN. THIS RAISES SOME

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:16.179 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IN THE SENSE THAT-

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:17.680 region:rollup2
DON'T WAIT OR TO SERVICES FOR

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:19.015 region:rollup2
DOING THAT REALLY INTERVENTION

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.917 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR INFANTS AND

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:24.287 region:rollup2
TODDLERS IN PARTICULAR. CAN

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:27.824 region:rollup2
HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS- ON LATER

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:31.794 region:rollup2
LIFE OUTCOMES AND AS WELL ON US

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:33.362 region:rollup2
OVERALL. COST TO THE STATE-

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:34.864 region:rollup2
FINALLY- JUST KNOW THAT ANOTHER

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:36.632 region:rollup2
QUESTION SORT OF BROUGHT INTO

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:38.468 region:rollup2
RELIEF BY THE PANDEMIC IS

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:40.136 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT- INDIVIDUALS

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:42.739 region:rollup2
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:43.506 region:rollup2

HEALTH CARE- THAT THEY OFTEN

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:51.247 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED. AND HOW WILL

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:54.117 region:rollup2
DEFERRED CARE- WE NEED TO MAYBE

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:56.119 region:rollup2
M. PROVIDE PROBLEMS- IN THE IN

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:58.755 region:rollup2
THE RECOVERY PHASE OF THE

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.789 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC. FINALLY THE LAST

CAN ACCESS EDUCATION BECAUSE OF

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:22.778 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF TECHNOLOGY AND

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:25.313 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS. IN TO MANY OF US HAVE

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:28.483 region:rollup2
GOTTEN COBIT THE DATA SHOWS HOW

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:30.652 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE WE ARE. THIS YEAR

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:34.856 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILY'S HARDSHIPS ARE A

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:37.359 region:rollup2
WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. THEY ARE

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:39.227 region:rollup2
MAGNIFIED BY ALL THE ISSUES

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:41.329 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING WITH

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:43.031 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO SHARE A FEW

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:43.999 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS FROM THE WORK THAT

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.300 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN DOING WITH A

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:50.405 region:rollup2
LATINO FAMILIES DURING THE

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:52.607 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC. THE DIRECTIVES WORK.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:55.377 region:rollup2
ONLY IF IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.911 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTORS THAT DDS ISSUED

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.480 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR

01:26:55.911 --> 01:27:00.482 region:rollup2
FAMILIES. BUT THERE IS

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.517 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A WALL WE HIT AT THE

01:27:00.482 --> 01:27:04.786 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS SOME REGIONAL

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:06.054 region:rollup2
CENTERS HAVE TOLD US. THAT THE

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:08.290 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR SORRY ARE NOT

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:09.891 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ARE

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:12.194 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES JUST SUGGESTIONS.

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:13.462 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T APPLY TO EVERYONE WE

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:15.730 region:rollup2
ARE SEEING A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:17.699 region:rollup2
HOW THIS MEASURES WERE MEANT TO

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:20.102 region:rollup2
HELP FAMILIES BUT IN MANY CASES

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:21.736 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT. IT WOULD BE

01:27:20.102 --> 01:27:23.739 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO HAVE A CLEAR

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:25.240 region:rollup2
DIRECTIVE THAT IS NOT LEFT UP

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:28.710 region:rollup2
TO THE TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:31.747 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMMUNITY

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:32.814 region:rollup2
VOICE MUST BE HEARD. THE MOST

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:34.649 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:36.651 region:rollup2
CONSULTED AT ALL LEVELS FROM

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:38.887 region:rollup2
THE VERY BEGINNING A COMMUNITY

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:40.889 region:rollup2
BASED ORGANIZATION. PARTNERS

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:44.192 region:rollup2
CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IF

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:44.793 region:rollup2
YOU TAKE OUR CONCERNS SERIOUSLY

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:49.531 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:51.733 region:rollup2
IT. CALDERON HUMILITY WORKS

01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:52.767 region:rollup2
THIS IS THEM ALL OFTEN LACKS A

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.669 region:rollup2
SENSE OF COMPASSION FOR

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:57.672 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THEY MUST GO THROUGH

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:59.641 region:rollup2
UNREALISTIC TO OBTAIN THE MUCH

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:01.843 region:rollup2
NEEDED SERVICES. THEY FEEL

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:03.945 region:rollup2
HUMILIATED FOR HAVING TO BEG

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.980 region:rollup2
FOR EXTRA HOURS OF SUPPORT.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.548 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE DENIED OUR

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:08.316 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO PRIMARILY SPEAK

01:28:06.548 --> 01:28:10.552 region:rollup2
SPANISH ARE TOLD THAT THEY

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:11.586 region:rollup2
SHOULD GO FOR A FAIR HEARING.

01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:13.555 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS NOTHING FAIR ABOUT

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:15.357 region:rollup2
THE HEARINGS WHEN OUR FAMILIES

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:18.226 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OR

01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:18.827 region:rollup2
THE LAW IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:21.463 region:rollup2
BRING LAWYERS AND EXPERIENCED

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:22.664 region:rollup2
STAFF. THERE ARE BRIGHT SPOTS

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:24.733 region:rollup2
BUT EVERYONE COULD DO A BETTER

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:27.869 region:rollup2
JOB OF VALIDATING EMBRACING AND

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:30.071 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY. COBIT

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:32.040 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A SENSE OF URGENCY.

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:33.241 region:rollup2
AND IT SADDENS ME WHEN A FAMILY

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.377 region:rollup2
MEMBER TURN SO THE REGIONAL

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:37.112 region:rollup2
CENTERS WHEN THEY GET COLD IT

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:38.880 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NO SENSE OF

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:40.482 region:rollup2
URGENCY THERE IS NO PROTOCOL.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.184 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER SOMETIMES WAIT

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:45.153 region:rollup2
WEEKS BEFORE PROVIDING AN

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:47.222 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO A REQUEST FOR HELP.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:48.890 region:rollup2
WE HEAR THAT SOME FAMILIES. ONE

01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:50.625 region:rollup2
EVEN REPORT THAT SOMEONE HAS

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.861 region:rollup2
TESTED POSITIVE BECAUSE THEY

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:54.930 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T RISK LOSING SERVICES

01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CHILDREN. FAMILIES

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:59.267 region:rollup2
ARE TRULY SCARE. JUST A COUPLE

01:28:57.365 --> 01:29:00.569 region:rollup2
OF WEEKS AGO WE WERE ASSISTING

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:02.170 region:rollup2
A FAMILY WHO WAS DENIED

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:03.939 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESPITE HOURS THE

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:06.174 region:rollup2
MOM WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGH

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:07.909 region:rollup2
RISK PREGNANCY AND HAD TWO

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:10.145 region:rollup2
OTHER CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. SHE

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:11.746 region:rollup2
HAD TO GO TO A FAIR HEARING

01:29:10.145 --> 01:29:14.683 region:rollup2
OVER THE PHONE TO MAKE THAT.

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:16.818 region:rollup2
EVEN WORSE BARRIER IT WAS SO

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:18.587 region:rollup2
STRESSFUL IN THE MEANING FOR

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:20.288 region:rollup2
HER THAT A FEW HOURS LATER SHE

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:23.225 region:rollup2
WENT INTO LABOR AND SHE

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:25.160 region:rollup2
DELIVERED HER BABY PREMATURELY

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:25.760 region:rollup2
THE BABY STILL IN THE NICK YOU.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.896 region:rollup2
NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.964 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY PARENTS ARE

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:30.832 region:rollup2
RUNNING IN A MAYES THAT NEVER

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:32.200 region:rollup2
ENDS THEY ASKED FOR HELP FROM

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:33.235 region:rollup2
THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEY

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.203 region:rollup2
POINT THEM TOWARDS THE SCHOOL

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:37.105 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL SENT PARENTS

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:39.474 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:41.142 region:rollup2
AND NO ONE GETS ANY HELP.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:43.144 region:rollup2
VACCINES HAVE BEEN ANOTHER

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:45.180 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF DISPARITY. MANY

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:47.482 region:rollup2
LATINOS WERE AFRAID OF THE

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.583 region:rollup2
VACCINEAT THE BEGINNING. EVEN

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:50.785 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO GET

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:52.654 region:rollup2
IT. WE HAVE BEEN EDUCATING

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:53.989 region:rollup2
OURSELVES AND NOW THAT THEY

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:56.992 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM WANT TO TAKE THE

01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:57.859 region:rollup2
VACCINE. BUT SOME HAVE TO ASK

01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:59.761 region:rollup2
FOR A LETTER FROM THE REGIONAL

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:02.497 region:rollup2
CENTERS AND EVEN THAT SOMETIMES

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:04.499 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A FIGHT. MANY LATINO

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:06.901 region:rollup2
PARENTS HAVE BEEN TURNED DOWN.

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:08.837 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILIES. ARE THE FRONTLINE

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:12.340 region:rollup2
WORKERS NOW. THEY ARE THE

01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:14.142 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THE AIDS THE PURPOSE.

EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THEIR KIDS

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:18.680 region:rollup2
WITH MINIMAL HELP. THEY ARE THE

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:20.649 region:rollup2
TRUE HEROES AND THEY SHOULD NOT

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.184 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BEG FOR EVERYTHING. I'M

01:30:20.649 --> 01:30:25.120 region:rollup2
HERE TO ASK FOR HELP. AND

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:26.888 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE I'LL SAY THAT THE

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.390 region:rollup2
ICC CAN FIGURE OUT THE ORDER. I

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:30.792 region:rollup2
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:32.360 region:rollup2

ABOUT THAT TIME LINE DOES NOT

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:26.007 region:rollup2
TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BEING THE

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:27.809 region:rollup2
MOST FORWARD THINKING INCLUSIVE

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:29.577 region:rollup2
CRITERIA I'VE SEEN- THROUGHOUT

01:32:27.809 --> 01:32:30.512 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY I THINK YOU SAW IN

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:32.180 region:rollup2
YOUR PRODUCT ROCKY HARLING

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:34.616 region:rollup2
WHETHER STATES ARE DOING IT.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:36.217 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CALIFORNIA DID WAS

01:32:34.616 --> 01:32:37.619 region:rollup2
KIND OF TOOK THE BEST FROM

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:39.120 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES WERE DOING AND IT

01:32:37.619 --> 01:32:40.955 region:rollup2
TOGETHER INTO ONE PROPOSAL.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.824 region:rollup2
EVEN WITNESSED PRAISE THERE ARE

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:45.260 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ELEMENTS WE STILL NEED

01:32:42.824 --> 01:32:48.963 region:rollup2
TO WORK FOR I TO COME TO MIND

01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:50.265 region:rollup2
WHO AND HOW- THE CRITERIA IS A

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:52.133 region:rollup2
LIST OF CONDITIONS AND

01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:52.567 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AND I THINK THIS

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:54.803 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE STATE AN

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:56.771 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. THE MEDICAL SYSTEM

01:32:54.803 --> 01:32:58.673 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR

01:32:56.771 --> 01:33:00.074 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION OF

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:01.276 region:rollup2
EACH REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:03.044 region:rollup2
OF EACH PERSON TO DEVELOP IN

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:06.981 region:rollup2
THE SOMEBODY EACH PERSON WHO

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:07.615 region:rollup2
FITS THIS CRITERIA. SO THERE'S

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:09.384 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION FOR THAT. THE STATE

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:11.252 region:rollup2
CAN EMPLOY THE DEATH. BY STATE.

01:33:09.384 --> 01:33:12.620 region:rollup2
ALL REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:14.289 region:rollup2
MEET THE DEFINITION. OF

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:16.024 region:rollup2

CRITERIA PROVIDING KOBE CARE

01:33:24.499 --> 01:33:28.803 region:rollup2
WILL BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE A

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:30.405 region:rollup2
PERSON'S DISABILITY. ABSOLUTELY

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:31.773 region:rollup2
SO THE STATE CAN ISSUE THIS

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:33.108 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CONSUMERS REGIONAL

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:35.543 region:rollup2
CENTER CONSUMERS CAN ALSO ISSUE

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:38.213 region:rollup2

TO DETERMINE THE BETTER

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:52.727 region:rollup2
DISABILITY IS SEVERE ENOUGH TO

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:54.662 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR THE STATE SERVICES.

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:56.865 region:rollup2
SO ANOTHER ISSUE A SEVERITY IS

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:57.866 region:rollup2
NOT NEEDED. ALSO IT'S HARD TO

01:33:56.865 --> 01:33:59.834 region:rollup2
MANAGING WHAT REGIONAL CENTER

01:35:43.438 --> 01:35:46.140 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:48.710 region:rollup2
IS TO HAVE THE THIRD PARTY

THIS INCREASES TRUST IT REDUCES

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:07.362 region:rollup2
VACCINE HESITANCY MAY ACTUALLY

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.230 region:rollup2
USE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF

01:43:37.178 --> 01:43:40.915 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND SO

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:42.917 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT AS ISOLATED- SO

01:43:40.915 --> 01:43:44.685 region:rollup2
AGAIN EVERYBODY HAS HAD TO

01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:46.921 region:rollup2
THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. I'M

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:48.923 region:rollup2
ON HOW TO SUPPORT- WE HAVE

01:43:46.921 --> 01:43:51.092 region:rollup2
SEEN- WHERE THERE'S BEEN A NEED

01:43:48.923 --> 01:43:53.527 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO- HAVE SOME

01:43:51.092 --> 01:43:54.695 region:rollup2
RESPITE UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:57.965 region:rollup2
THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:59.233 region:rollup2
GREATEST. IMPACT OF LOSS OF

01:43:57.965 --> 01:44:00.334 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS. MORE FAILURE TO WE

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:02.336 region:rollup2
HAVE TO STILL SEE IF THEY'RE

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.471 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE.

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:05.973 region:rollup2
SERVICES IS OUT OF HOME

01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:07.408 region:rollup2
RESPITE- SO IMMEDIATELY WE

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:09.477 region:rollup2
REALLY DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:11.378 region:rollup2
AT HOW DO WE START GAINING. YOU

01:44:09.477 --> 01:44:12.747 region:rollup2
KNOW ADAM HOME RESPITE OR THOSE

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:14.882 region:rollup2
RESOURCES SO FAMILIES CAN

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.783 region:rollup2
ACCESS THEM AND NOT HAVE

01:44:14.882 --> 01:44:18.152 region:rollup2
FURTHER DELAY IN GETTING THAT

01:44:15.783 --> 01:44:19.753 region:rollup2
REALLY- SO RIGHT NOW WE JUST

01:44:18.152 --> 01:44:21.822 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STAY VERY

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:23.991 region:rollup2
DILIGENT- I THINK IT WAS- VERY

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:25.960 region:rollup2
WELL NOTED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:28.529 region:rollup2
LONGER TERM. IMPACTS ARE GOING

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:29.930 region:rollup2
TO. BE FACED BY THESE FAMILIES

01:44:28.529 --> 01:44:31.232 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:33.701 region:rollup2
THEM AND SEE WHAT SUPPORT WE

01:44:31.232 --> 01:44:35.970 region:rollup2
CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE- SO WE

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:38.672 region:rollup2
CAN- MEDICAID-ANY ADDITIONAL

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:40.241 region:rollup2
OUR FUTURE RESTS. ON SHOULD IT

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:42.243 region:rollup2
BE FACED. ONE MORE QUESTION

01:44:40.241 --> 01:44:44.812 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CHAIR. OF MARTIN

01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:46.914 region:rollup2
WHEN WE- TALKED EARLIER IT WHEN

THE ONSET OF CODED. THERE WAS A

01:44:46.914 --> 01:44:50.851 region:rollup2
LOT OF CONFUSION AND I REALLY

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:53.187 region:rollup2
DO APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY.

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:54.522 region:rollup2
COMPONENT TO THIS BECAUSE ONE

01:44:53.187 --> 01:44:56.724 region:rollup2
SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND YOU

01:44:54.522 --> 01:44:58.692 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO BE ADAPTIVE. AND

01:44:56.724 --> 01:45:00.361 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. ENCOURAGED THE

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:02.163 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO BE FLEXIBLE AND

01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:07.134 region:rollup2
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WHICH WAS

01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:09.103 region:rollup2
UNIQUE. IN OUR WORLD- BUT WHAT

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:11.172 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK IS IT

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:13.107 region:rollup2

01:45:11.172 --> 01:45:15.142 region:rollup2
BEGINNING AND NOT WHAT HOW MANY

01:45:13.107 --> 01:45:17.444 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ACTUALLY WE DID WE

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:19.313 region:rollup2
LOSE TO ATTRITION. AND THEN

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:21.949 region:rollup2
ALSO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:25.085 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF THAT. THE WORK FORCE

01:45:21.949 --> 01:45:27.121 region:rollup2

MEASURABLE OUTCOME FOR THE I.

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:36.664 region:rollup2
D. D. POPULATION. DUE TO THE

01:45:33.394 --> 01:45:39.133 region:rollup2
LOSS OF PROVIDERS WHO WORKED

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:42.102 region:rollup2
INITIALLY ABLE TO. BEAR THE

01:45:39.133 --> 01:45:44.071 region:rollup2
BRUNT OF THE OF THE UNCERTAINTY

THAT ON THE NEXT PANEL I HAVE A

01:45:56.584 --> 01:46:00.221 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ASKED OF

01:45:57.918 --> 01:46:02.756 region:rollup2
ME- IS KIND OF WHAT IS THAT

01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:05.960 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. NETWORK WHAT WHO HAVE

WE LOST- I'LL START WITH WE

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.764 region:rollup2
HAVE LIMITED VISIBILITY INTO-

01:46:09.797 --> 01:46:13.167 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S PROVIDERS WERE NO

01:46:10.764 --> 01:46:14.535 region:rollup2
LONGER PROVIDING SERVICES AND

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:16.971 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONTINUING TO TAKE A LOOK

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:19.106 region:rollup2
AT IT BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE. IS

01:46:16.971 --> 01:46:21.108 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING- VERY CLOSE LOOK

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:22.610 region:rollup2
AT THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:24.311 region:rollup2
BILLING BUT WHAT WE CALL

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:27.114 region:rollup2
CLAIMING SO WE LOOK AT OUR

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:30.017 region:rollup2
CLAIMS. AND TO SEE HOW MANY

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:33.320 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WHO WORK- SUBMITTING

01:46:30.017 --> 01:46:36.824 region:rollup2
BILLS OR CLAIMS. FOR PRIOR TO

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:39.193 region:rollup2
KOBE AND HOW MANY- POST CODE.

01:46:36.824 --> 01:46:41.095 region:rollup2
AND SO- JUST YOUR- WITH YOU

01:46:39.193 --> 01:46:47.401 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE WERE SEEN AND IN

01:46:41.095 --> 01:46:51.105 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS- WE HAVE. IT NET.

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:51.672 region:rollup2
SO A NET DECREASE OF TWO

01:46:51.105 --> 01:46:55.075 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT VENDORS

01:46:51.672 --> 01:46:57.845 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT CLAIMING- THAT AS

01:46:55.075 --> 01:47:00.414 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO BEFORE- MARCH

01:46:57.845 --> 01:47:04.018 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY. SO OF THAT WE

01:47:00.414 --> 01:47:06.086 region:rollup2
HAD. ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

01:47:04.018 --> 01:47:07.755 region:rollup2
FIFTY FOUR VENDORS THAT- WERE

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:11.158 region:rollup2
NOT. HAVE NOT CLAIMED

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:13.060 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY- SO THAT WOULD.

01:47:11.158 --> 01:47:15.996 region:rollup2
INDICATE IS THAT LOSING THOSE

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:19.133 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND- IT RAISING THAT

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:20.868 region:rollup2
QUESTION- HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK

01:47:19.133 --> 01:47:22.670 region:rollup2
AT THOSE THAT ARE NOT CLAIMING

01:47:20.868 --> 01:47:24.905 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:26.507 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IS OUT OF HOME RESPITE

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:29.076 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE IS ON THIS ONE IS

01:47:26.507 --> 01:47:29.910 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TRANSPORTATION- WE'VE

01:47:29.076 --> 01:47:31.645 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING WITH OUR

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:33.547 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS ON HOW

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:35.783 region:rollup2
DO WE ESTABLISH. KIND OF THOSE

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:36.850 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE SERVICES IT'S BEEN-

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:38.452 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:40.487 region:rollup2
THE TRICKIEST AND ESTABLISHING

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:43.190 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE SERVICES RATE. AN

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:45.526 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE MENTAL STAFFING SO IN

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:47.061 region:rollup2
IN- AT SITES WHETHER IT'S DAY

01:47:45.526 --> 01:47:48.862 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OTHER SITES THE

01:47:47.061 --> 01:47:50.998 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING THESE ARE

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:53.867 region:rollup2
THE THREE MAIN CATEGORIES AND

01:47:50.998 --> 01:47:55.502 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WE ARE SEEN. THOSE ONE

01:47:53.867 --> 01:48:00.107 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SO ROUNDING UP FIFTEEN

01:47:55.502 --> 01:48:01.008 region:rollup2
HUNDRED- PROVIDERS NOT CLAIMING

01:48:00.107 --> 01:48:03.744 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY GET. ON THE FLIP SIDE-

01:48:01.008 --> 01:48:05.546 region:rollup2
ACT KOBE WE HAVE AN-

01:48:03.744 --> 01:48:07.581 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:09.116 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS- AND THAT'S NOT SO

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:11.785 region:rollup2
MUCH PROVIDERS BUT-

01:48:09.116 --> 01:48:13.954 region:rollup2
VECTORIZATION. SO IT MAY BE

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:14.755 region:rollup2
USED BY EXISTING VENDORS ON SO

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:17.558 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THOSE THAT ARE

01:48:14.755 --> 01:48:19.626 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CLAIMS NOW WE'RE

01:48:17.558 --> 01:48:21.295 region:rollup2
SEEING SIMILAR THEN. WE'RE

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:22.396 region:rollup2
SUPPORT INTO RESIDENTIAL

01:48:21.295 --> 01:48:24.865 region:rollup2
SETTINGS THAT'S BEEN AN

01:48:22.396 --> 01:48:26.700 region:rollup2
INCREASE SO WE'RE SEEN EXISTING

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:28.736 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS LIKE ADDING ON

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.671 region:rollup2
SERVICE CODES- BUT TO GET TO

01:48:28.736 --> 01:48:32.673 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION AS FAR AS LIKE

01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:34.875 region:rollup2
THAT THE OVERALL KIND OF

01:48:32.673 --> 01:48:38.979 region:rollup2
NETWORK- WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:41.482 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF DETAIL- WE TOOK EARLY

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:42.850 region:rollup2
ACTION- CERTAINLY THE RETENTION

01:48:41.482 --> 01:48:45.185 region:rollup2
PAYMENT WAS SUPPORTIVE AND

01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:46.620 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO PROVIDERS- BUT WE

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:48.455 region:rollup2
ALSO KNEW THAT THAT WAS GOING

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.424 region:rollup2
TO BE TIME LIMITED WE- RENEW

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:51.692 region:rollup2
THAT- NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT

01:48:50.424 --> 01:48:52.960 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WAS SUSTAINABLE

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:54.995 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.397 region:rollup2
WERE. GETTING VISIBILITY AND TO

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:58.799 region:rollup2
HELP PROVIDERS WERE PROVIDING

01:48:56.397 --> 01:49:00.134 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. I'M SO

01:48:58.799 --> 01:49:01.402 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:49:00.134 --> 01:49:02.703 region:rollup2
AT WHAT IS OUR ALTERNATIVE

01:49:01.402 --> 01:49:03.837 region:rollup2
APPROACH BECAUSE WE WERE ALSO

01:49:02.703 --> 01:49:06.140 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE GETTING FEDERAL

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:07.741 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. SO WE QUICKLY LOOKED

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.810 region:rollup2
AT AND WORK WITH PROVIDERS AND

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:12.112 region:rollup2
WE GOT INPUT FROM AN ID NUMBER

01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:14.114 region:rollup2
OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SAY OKAY

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:15.616 region:rollup2
WE GET AS AS MRS GOMEZ HAD

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:17.851 region:rollup2
NOTED. WE HAD FAMILIES THAT

01:49:15.616 --> 01:49:20.120 region:rollup2
NEEDED FOOD SO WE NEED TO THINK

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:21.789 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFERENTLY AND SAY OKAY

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:27.594 region:rollup2
NOW IS ABOUT THE TIME OF BEING

01:49:21.789 --> 01:49:28.929 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE. NO MEETING PEOPLE

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:30.831 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE SO EVERYTHING

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:33.100 region:rollup2

01:49:34.568 --> 01:49:38.639 region:rollup2
CREATIVE THINGS AND I. I THINK

01:49:37.104 --> 01:49:41.108 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THERE'S SOME GOOD

01:49:38.639 --> 01:49:43.343 region:rollup2
THINGS HAVE COME OUT OF- SOME

01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:45.245 region:rollup2
OF THE BEST STRUGGLES THAT WE

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:46.480 region:rollup2
FACE IN THESE CHALLENGES THAT

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:47.748 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY IS MEETING SOME OF

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.717 region:rollup2

THOSE STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO MAKE

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:48.501 region:rollup2

YOU HEARD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:02.782 region:rollup2
DO A SPANISH SPEAKING TRAINING.

INTERPRETATION- AND- FROM

02:02:08.121 --> 02:02:11.758 region:rollup2
ENGLISH TO SPANISH- SO THESE

ARE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO WORK

02:02:11.758 --> 02:02:14.694 region:rollup2

02:02:21.201 --> 02:02:23.603 region:rollup2
NO EXCUSE AND I'M NOT

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:25.271 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING FOR A SECOND BUT THE

DATA IS NOT ACCURATE BUT I

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.708 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:02:26.873 --> 02:02:31.244 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO REPORT BASED ON-

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:34.414 region:rollup2

AGGREGATE DATA- WE DO HAVE-

02:02:34.414 --> 02:02:38.618 region:rollup2
VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THAT

02:02:35.682 --> 02:02:40.320 region:rollup2
DATA- YOU KNOW AND AGAIN IT'S

02:02:38.618 --> 02:02:42.021 region:rollup2
NOT MINIMIZING THE PROBLEM.

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.190 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:45.225 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:47.026 region:rollup2

NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

WHITE AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER

02:02:55.335 --> 02:02:58.771 region:rollup2

02:16:40.993 --> 02:16:43.862 region:rollup2
THEY'RE KNOWN BY A NUMBER OF

02:16:42.261 --> 02:16:45.130 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NAMES AND SO OFTEN

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:46.965 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS A STRANGE

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:49.702 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY- THEY

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:52.037 region:rollup2
DO- SETS A NEW- RULES OR

02:16:49.702 --> 02:16:54.606 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AROUND HOW SERVICES

HAVE AND THEN OR DO THOSE

02:16:59.211 --> 02:17:03.115 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORT COMMUNITY

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.950 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION. SO I'M GONNA

02:17:03.115 --> 02:17:06.452 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE KEY

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:07.953 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN

02:17:06.452 --> 02:17:10.022 region:rollup2
OUR TRANSITION PLAN WHICH WE

02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:11.123 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT IS

02:17:10.022 --> 02:17:13.025 region:rollup2
A REQUIREMENT OF THE SETTING

02:17:11.123 --> 02:17:15.728 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AS WELL THAT WE

02:17:13.025 --> 02:17:16.995 region:rollup2
HAVE INITIAL APPROVAL OF THIS.

02:17:15.728 --> 02:17:18.397 region:rollup2
TRANSITION PLAN THROUGH THE

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:20.232 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE

02:17:18.397 --> 02:17:22.868 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAID SERVICES ALTHOUGH

02:17:20.232 --> 02:17:24.903 region:rollup2
WE STILL HAVE SOME MORE TO GO

02:17:22.868 --> 02:17:25.571 region:rollup2
TO GET FINAL APPROVAL ON THAT.

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:27.239 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE

02:17:25.571 --> 02:17:28.774 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO IS REALLY DO AN

02:17:27.239 --> 02:17:29.775 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE AND

02:17:28.774 --> 02:17:31.677 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE SETTINGS ARE

02:17:29.775 --> 02:17:34.646 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE. IN MEETING THE

02:17:31.677 --> 02:17:37.149 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND SO- OVER THE

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:38.550 region:rollup2
SUMMER WE- COMPLETED THE FIRST

02:17:37.149 --> 02:17:40.686 region:rollup2
STEP OF THAT WHICH IS A

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:42.287 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SELF ASSESSMENT. TO

02:17:40.686 --> 02:17:44.823 region:rollup2
WEAR OF THAT IS AS THE NAME

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:46.558 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST WHERE- PROVIDERS

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:47.860 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH AN INJURY WITH WITH

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:49.294 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:51.230 region:rollup2
THAT SET THE STAGE REQUIREMENTS

02:17:49.294 --> 02:17:53.565 region:rollup2
AND IDENTIFY. WHETHER THEY NEED

02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:56.268 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND IF

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:57.803 region:rollup2
NOT. START TO IDENTIFY SOME

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:59.738 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO

02:17:57.803 --> 02:18:01.106 region:rollup2
IT TO ADDRESS AND CHANGE THAT.

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:03.609 region:rollup2
NOW THIS SELF ASSESSMENT

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:04.977 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS REALLY- MEARS AND-

02:18:03.609 --> 02:18:06.845 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH A LITTLE MORE IN

02:18:04.977 --> 02:18:08.514 region:rollup2
DEPTH. THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:12.284 region:rollup2
OVER THE PREVIOUS FEW YEARS

02:18:08.514 --> 02:18:13.118 region:rollup2
WITH. HELP FROM FUNDING IN THE

02:18:12.284 --> 02:18:14.953 region:rollup2
BUDGET. DENTIST OF THAT THERE

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:16.622 region:rollup2
BE SOME SUPPORT ACTORS. AND

02:18:14.953 --> 02:18:18.557 region:rollup2
THEN. MONEY NEEDED FOR

02:18:16.622 --> 02:18:20.993 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

02:18:18.557 --> 02:18:23.095 region:rollup2
TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS- THE

02:18:20.993 --> 02:18:25.230 region:rollup2
INITIAL RESULTS OF THE SELF

02:18:23.095 --> 02:18:26.698 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT SHOWED THAT 67% OF

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:27.366 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS REPORTED THAT

02:18:26.698 --> 02:18:29.134 region:rollup2
THEY WERE MEETING ALL THE

02:18:27.366 --> 02:18:31.270 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. AND OBVIOUSLY

02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:32.037 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT 33% OF THE

02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:34.139 region:rollup2
STATE STILL NEEDED TO MAKE SOME

02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:35.674 region:rollup2
CHANGES THE RESULTS OF THESE

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:37.176 region:rollup2
AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:39.678 region:rollup2
ARE POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S

02:18:37.176 --> 02:18:40.879 region:rollup2
WEBSITE. AND AS REQUIRED BY

02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:42.181 region:rollup2
STATE STATUTE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:44.283 region:rollup2
UPDATE THAT PERIODICALLY WITH

02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:47.653 region:rollup2
THE NEXT UPDATE IS DUE- I

02:18:44.283 --> 02:18:49.388 region:rollup2
BELIEVE NEXT MONTH. IN MARCH.

02:18:47.653 --> 02:18:51.356 region:rollup2
SO THE NEXT STEP WHEN WE TALK

02:18:49.388 --> 02:18:53.492 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THOSE INITIAL-

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:54.726 region:rollup2
PROVIDER OF SELF ASSESSMENTS.

02:18:53.492 --> 02:18:56.929 region:rollup2
THAT WAS FOR ALL APPLICABLE

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:58.964 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THEN NEXT IN WHAT

02:18:56.929 --> 02:19:00.499 region:rollup2
WE'VE STARTED DOING IS AS

02:18:58.964 --> 02:19:02.301 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN THE TRANSITION PLAN

02:19:00.499 --> 02:19:05.137 region:rollup2
IS AN ON SITE ASSESSMENT. SO

02:19:02.301 --> 02:19:06.872 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE A SAMPLE OF

02:19:05.137 --> 02:19:08.373 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS NATURALLY TO VALIDATE.

02:19:06.872 --> 02:19:10.175 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF THOSE- PROVIDER

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:12.144 region:rollup2
SELF ASSESSMENTS SO WE'VE

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:14.012 region:rollup2
ENGAGED A CONTRACTOR TO HELP

02:19:12.144 --> 02:19:17.015 region:rollup2
ASSIST TO HELP THE JUSTICE THAN

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:18.951 region:rollup2

TRANSITION PLAN WE'VE HAD TO

02:19:20.319 --> 02:19:25.457 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT- WE STARTED IN

02:19:22.788 --> 02:19:28.160 region:rollup2
PILOTED- WITH. ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:30.796 region:rollup2
TWENTY PROVIDERS JOINED-

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.064 region:rollup2
VIRTUAL OR REMOTE ASSESSMENT.

02:19:30.796 --> 02:19:34.132 region:rollup2
TO WALK THROUGH THE AND

02:19:32.064 --> 02:19:35.434 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHERE PROVIDERS ARE IT

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:37.369 region:rollup2
AND THEN COMPARING THAT TO WHAT

02:19:35.434 --> 02:19:39.571 region:rollup2
THEIR SELF ASSESSMENTS SAID AS

02:19:37.369 --> 02:19:41.240 region:rollup2
WELL WE JUST COMPLETED THAT

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:44.610 region:rollup2
INITIAL PILOT PHASE HERE JUST

RESULTS OF THOSE ARE IN AND

02:19:47.012 --> 02:19:51.817 region:rollup2
WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE TO MAKE.

02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:53.819 region:rollup2
TO GO FORWARD AND- FOR THE REST

02:19:51.817 --> 02:19:54.386 region:rollup2
OF THE PROVIDERS THAT NEED TO

02:19:53.819 --> 02:19:56.388 region:rollup2
DO THAT SO ULTIMATELY WE'RE

02:19:54.386 --> 02:19:57.356 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT. THINKING THAT WE'RE

02:19:56.388 --> 02:20:02.027 region:rollup2
GONNA NEED ABOUT TWELVE

02:19:57.356 --> 02:20:04.429 region:rollup2
HUNDRED- OF THESE. ON SITE

02:20:02.027 --> 02:20:07.165 region:rollup2
SLASH VIRTUAL ASSESSED. AS

02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:09.001 region:rollup2
OUTLINE IN OUR TWO. PLAN SO IN

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:10.669 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THAT AS DOES

02:20:09.001 --> 02:20:12.037 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES- ANOTHER

02:20:10.669 --> 02:20:14.606 region:rollup2
BIG COMPONENT WAS TRANSITION

02:20:12.037 --> 02:20:15.140 region:rollup2
PLAN AS ONGOING INFORMATION

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:18.877 region:rollup2
SHARING RATHER BE THROUGH

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:20.212 region:rollup2
TRAINING- AND THE LIKE FOR-

02:20:18.877 --> 02:20:22.581 region:rollup2

THAT AND WILL CONTINUE THEIR-

02:20:27.319 --> 02:20:32.124 region:rollup2
UPCOMING ABOUT THE STRANGE

THE HOME IF YOU MAY SERVICES.

02:20:43.602 --> 02:20:47.539 region:rollup2
SO IN SUMMARY EVEN THOUGH THERE

02:20:45.871 --> 02:20:48.407 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF DELAYS

02:20:47.539 --> 02:20:50.242 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME

02:20:48.407 --> 02:20:52.611 region:rollup2
CHANGES WITH- DUE TO THE

02:20:50.242 --> 02:20:54.446 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC. WE STILL ON TRACK TO

JUST TO AT A HIGH LEVEL THE

02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:07.592 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS TO GET FINAL

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:09.461 region:rollup2
APPROVAL OF THAT TRANSITION

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:12.364 region:rollup2
PLAN. OR FOR A STATE SOME OF

02:21:09.461 --> 02:21:13.198 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE INCLUDED

02:21:12.364 --> 02:21:14.232 region:rollup2
IN THAT AS IS AN ESTIMATE. OF

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:16.301 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF SETTINGS

02:21:14.232 --> 02:21:19.504 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS. THAT ARE MEETING THE

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:20.772 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. LIKEWISE IN THE-

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:22.641 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF STANDING DURING

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:23.875 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES. THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:21:22.641 --> 02:21:25.077 region:rollup2
MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:26.712 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT STEPS WE'RE GOING TO

02:21:25.077 --> 02:21:28.747 region:rollup2
TAKE TO. TO MEET THOSE

02:21:26.712 --> 02:21:32.150 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BOTH IN THE BALLOT

02:21:28.747 --> 02:21:34.786 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO WHAT OUR SYSTEM

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:37.289 region:rollup2
IS FOR ONGOING OVERSIGHT. SO

02:21:34.786 --> 02:21:38.857 region:rollup2
NEXT ON A TOUCH ON OF WHERE WE

02:21:37.289 --> 02:21:41.460 region:rollup2
ARE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:43.428 region:rollup2
SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AND

02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:45.630 region:rollup2
JUST FOR- TO START WITH

02:21:43.428 --> 02:21:47.599 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN WELL ACTUALLY AS

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:49.167 region:rollup2
OF THE NINTH OF FEBRUARY WE

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:49.735 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:52.371 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

02:21:49.735 --> 02:21:54.940 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONED AND YOUR- STUFF TO

02:21:52.371 --> 02:21:57.442 region:rollup2
TERMINATION. COMPARISON ONLY

02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:58.677 region:rollup2
TAKE ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO AT THE

02:21:57.442 --> 02:22:00.278 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND AND

02:21:58.677 --> 02:22:01.213 region:rollup2
TWENTY. THERE WERE JUST OVER A

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:02.481 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAD MADE

02:22:01.213 --> 02:22:05.050 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSITION AND MOST OF

02:22:02.481 --> 02:22:06.251 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD

02:22:05.050 --> 02:22:07.886 region:rollup2
BEEN PURCHASED BENSON THE

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:11.156 region:rollup2
FORMER SELF DETERMINATION PILOT

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:13.425 region:rollup2
PROJECT. SO IT'S BEEN. A

02:22:11.156 --> 02:22:14.826 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE- SENSE

02:22:13.425 --> 02:22:18.530 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE STILL OBVIOUSLY

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:19.131 region:rollup2
WORK WORK SHOULD TWO ZERO AND

02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:20.699 region:rollup2
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT HERE AND

02:22:19.131 --> 02:22:21.833 region:rollup2
THE SECOND. SO AND I KNOW ONE

02:22:20.699 --> 02:22:23.368 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WHAT'S

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:24.403 region:rollup2
BEEN THE IMPACT OF KOBE AND

02:22:23.368 --> 02:22:26.538 region:rollup2
WHILE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:22:24.403 --> 02:22:28.540 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO SAY EXACTLY-

02:22:26.538 --> 02:22:30.409 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S- FOR SELF

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:32.677 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION WHAT THAT. IMPACT

ADD SOME. REPORTS THAT IN FACT

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:38.650 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY IS

02:22:36.648 --> 02:22:40.485 region:rollup2
THAT SELF DETERMINATION OFFERS

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:42.888 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:44.222 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT- THAT

02:24:59.724 --> 02:25:03.061 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND THE PRIORITIES

THE SERVICE OPTIONS DURING THE

02:26:34.419 --> 02:26:37.856 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC AND BEYOND AND GET

02:26:35.787 --> 02:26:38.456 region:rollup2
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON

02:26:37.856 --> 02:26:40.625 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SHORT AND LONG TERM

02:26:38.456 --> 02:26:42.627 region:rollup2
CHANGES. YEAH WE MENTIONED

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:43.862 region:rollup2
EARLIER IN IN THE AGENDA NUMBER

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:45.030 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WE NEED TO

02:26:43.862 --> 02:26:46.631 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE

02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:48.166 region:rollup2
LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC.

02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:49.367 region:rollup2
AND HELPED SHAPE WHAT THINGS

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:51.970 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE LONG

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:52.570 region:rollup2
TERM CERTAINLY THINGS THAT THAT

02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:55.106 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR BARGE IN AND OTHERS

02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:56.207 region:rollup2
HAVE MENTIONED- SOME OF THOSE

02:26:55.106 --> 02:26:57.575 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE INCREASING THAT

02:26:56.207 --> 02:26:59.911 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PARTICIPANT DIRECTED

02:26:57.575 --> 02:27:01.780 region:rollup2
SERVICES. REMOTE DELIVERY OF

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:03.181 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND ACCESS TO SERVICES

02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:06.685 region:rollup2
AND SOME OTHERS ARE THOSE THAT

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:07.285 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT. TO

02:27:06.685 --> 02:27:09.087 region:rollup2
CONTINUE AND CODIFY AS WE MOVE

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:11.222 region:rollup2
FORWARD. WE REALLY DO NEED TO

02:27:09.087 --> 02:27:13.258 region:rollup2
HAVE A- FOR A PRIORITY A

02:27:11.222 --> 02:27:15.427 region:rollup2
CONTINUED FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL

02:27:13.258 --> 02:27:17.662 region:rollup2
CHOICE. AND FLEXIBILITY NOT

02:27:15.427 --> 02:27:18.263 region:rollup2
ONLY IN THE WAY THAT SERVICES

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:20.065 region:rollup2
ARE RECEIVED BUT THE WAY THAT

02:27:18.263 --> 02:27:21.900 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DELIVER. SO WITH THESE

02:27:20.065 --> 02:27:24.069 region:rollup2
AS AS FOCUSED WITH PRIORITIES

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:26.104 region:rollup2
ARE WORK- IT REALLY HAS TO THEN

02:27:24.069 --> 02:27:27.906 region:rollup2
ICLUDE. WHAT IS THE PAYMENT

02:27:26.104 --> 02:27:29.407 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE AND SERVICE DELIVERY

02:27:27.906 --> 02:27:31.543 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT'S GONNA ENABLE

02:27:29.407 --> 02:27:34.112 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS. TO SUPPORT THOSE

02:27:31.543 --> 02:27:34.679 region:rollup2
OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY THAT

02:27:34.112 --> 02:27:37.682 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES

02:27:34.679 --> 02:27:40.919 region:rollup2
WALKED. SO THAT'LL BE A REALLY

02:27:37.682 --> 02:27:43.588 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:27:40.919 --> 02:27:44.656 region:rollup2
REALLY A FOCUS IS TO. ONCE WE

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:47.025 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHAT THE PRIORITIES

02:27:44.656 --> 02:27:48.026 region:rollup2
ARE TO HELP AND IDENTIFY WHAT

02:27:47.025 --> 02:27:51.096 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN

02:27:48.026 --> 02:27:51.930 region:rollup2
PLACE TO- AND PAYMENT

02:27:51.096 --> 02:27:53.898 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES ARE STILL GOING TO

02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:56.234 region:rollup2
BE A BIG PART OF IT. TOO TO

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:58.870 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE ONGOING DELIVERY OF

02:27:56.234 --> 02:28:00.772 region:rollup2
SERVICES. AND THEN FINALLY I

02:27:58.870 --> 02:28:02.440 region:rollup2
WANT TO- AND WITH- SOME

02:28:00.772 --> 02:28:04.442 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE SO

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.477 region:rollup2
THAT AS HAS HAPPENED OVER THE

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:07.612 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE MINIMUM

02:28:05.477 --> 02:28:09.781 region:rollup2
WAGE TO INCREASE AGAIN- THIS

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:11.449 region:rollup2
JANUARY AND SO LIKE WE DONE

02:28:09.781 --> 02:28:13.918 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY WE DID PUT OUT.

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:15.520 region:rollup2
ACTIONS ON ON HOW THAT IS-

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:16.855 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED IT'S

02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:19.290 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT IT'S BEEN DONE

02:28:16.855 --> 02:28:20.258 region:rollup2
AND PREVIOUS YEARS. WHICH FOR

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:23.862 region:rollup2
THE MOST PART THAT PROVIDERS

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:24.396 region:rollup2
ARE IN SYMMETRIC QUESTIONS OF

02:28:23.862 --> 02:28:27.065 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OR REGIONAL

02:28:24.396 --> 02:28:28.433 region:rollup2
CENTER- SO IT WILL TAKE.

02:28:27.065 --> 02:28:31.069 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF WHEN

02:28:28.433 --> 02:28:32.771 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM WAGE GOES AND- INTO

02:28:31.069 --> 02:28:34.506 region:rollup2
A FACT AND THEN. THE TIME THAT

02:28:32.771 --> 02:28:36.341 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ANY RATE CHANGES GET

02:28:34.506 --> 02:28:37.742 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN CLAIMS

02:28:36.341 --> 02:28:39.677 region:rollup2
ARE SUBMITTED IT DOES TAKE

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:41.012 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS FOR US TO. TO

02:28:39.677 --> 02:28:43.648 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY GET WHAT IS THE

02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:45.550 region:rollup2
ACTUAL IMPACT OF WHAT DOES THE

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:47.819 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE SAYS. YES

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:50.255 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE AGENDA DID ASK TO

02:28:47.819 --> 02:28:51.990 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SOME PRIOR YEAR

02:28:50.255 --> 02:28:55.193 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES. WHAT WE'VE NOTICED

02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:56.361 region:rollup2
INSIDE YOU JUST FOR- EXAMPLE.

02:28:55.193 --> 02:28:58.129 region:rollup2
FOR THE INCREASE THAT TOOK

02:28:56.361 --> 02:29:00.732 region:rollup2
EFFECT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

02:28:58.129 --> 02:29:02.767 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL

02:29:00.732 --> 02:29:04.335 region:rollup2
IMPACT FOR THE SUBSEQUENT

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:06.104 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR WAS ESTIMATED IN

02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:06.905 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET TO BE. ABOUT A

02:29:06.104 --> 02:29:08.606 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT

02:29:06.905 --> 02:29:10.442 region:rollup2
MILLION. WHEREAS WHEN WE LOOK

02:29:08.606 --> 02:29:13.878 region:rollup2
BACK ON THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES

02:29:10.442 --> 02:29:14.479 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT THAT WAS ABOUT

02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:15.880 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AN

02:29:14.479 --> 02:29:17.882 region:rollup2
ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. SIMILARLY

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.918 region:rollup2
FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:21.486 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY OF

02:29:19.918 --> 02:29:24.389 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY. THE ESTIMATED

02:29:21.486 --> 02:29:26.024 region:rollup2
ANNUAL IMPACT WAS A HUNDRED

02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:27.892 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:29:26.024 --> 02:29:30.862 region:rollup2
AND THE ACTUAL- EXPENDITURES

02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:32.831 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR- WHERE

02:29:30.862 --> 02:29:35.700 region:rollup2
IT IS A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED

02:29:32.831 --> 02:29:38.002 region:rollup2
SEVEN NAY. SO WITH THIS CURRENT

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:39.804 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE AND INCREASE- WE

02:29:38.002 --> 02:29:41.472 region:rollup2
WILL AND SEVERAL MONTHS IN A

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:44.075 region:rollup2
LIKELY BE AFTER THEM THAT THE

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:45.910 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET IS ENACTED A LITTLE

02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:49.848 region:rollup2
BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:51.316 region:rollup2
SEEING- THE IMPACT IS THIS TIME

02:29:49.848 --> 02:29:52.817 region:rollup2
AND- AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

02:29:51.316 --> 02:29:54.219 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME. THINGS THAT

02:29:52.817 --> 02:29:57.689 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT CHALLENGING FOR US TO

02:29:54.219 --> 02:29:59.724 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT TO- ESTIMATE THE IMPACT

02:29:57.689 --> 02:30:01.292 region:rollup2

BEEN WAS- WHAT IS THE RATIONALE

02:30:27.652 --> 02:30:30.989 region:rollup2
FOR THIS INSPECTION POLICY

02:30:29.087 --> 02:30:33.992 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED YES SO WELL KNOWN

02:30:30.989 --> 02:30:35.627 region:rollup2

FORECASTED STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE

02:30:35.627 --> 02:30:38.463 region:rollup2
IN THE MULTI YEAR THE

02:30:36.794 --> 02:30:40.198 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

02:30:38.463 --> 02:30:42.033 region:rollup2
SUSPEND THE HOME LOAN RATES ON

02:30:40.198 --> 02:30:43.801 region:rollup2
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY

02:30:42.033 --> 02:30:45.270 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO. THE SPECIAL TO BE

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:47.272 region:rollup2
LEFT THAT IF THEY MINISTRATION

PROGRAMS AND SUBSEQUENT TO

02:30:53.111 --> 02:30:57.582 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEARS. SO THESE CHANGES

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:58.683 region:rollup2
REFLECT A SIMILAR APPROACH

02:30:57.582 --> 02:31:01.085 region:rollup2
ADOPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

02:30:58.683 --> 02:31:02.320 region:rollup2

YOUR SHORTFALL IN THE NEED FOR

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:09.761 region:rollup2

THE END OF THE SUSPENSION

02:31:19.404 --> 02:31:21.873 region:rollup2
PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

TWENTY TWO. SO THE FUNDING FOR

02:31:25.877 --> 02:31:28.947 region:rollup2
THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES- WOULD

02:31:27.145 --> 02:31:30.748 region:rollup2
BE REDUCED HOWEVER THE FUNNY

02:31:28.947 --> 02:31:32.283 region:rollup2

WOMEN ALREADY- INCREASED

02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:35.820 region:rollup2

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:38.256 region:rollup2
FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR A

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:41.359 region:rollup2
CASELOAD AND UTILIZATION AS

02:31:53.104 --> 02:31:56.274 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:19.644 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THEIR SUPPORTS.

02:35:17.542 --> 02:35:20.611 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KEY THING THAT WE DO

02:35:19.644 --> 02:35:22.747 region:rollup2
THAT OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:24.849 region:rollup2
HEARING IS THAT THE VARIETY OF

02:35:22.747 --> 02:35:27.818 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY EARLY IN THE SYSTEM

02:35:24.849 --> 02:35:29.420 region:rollup2
IS MAKING THINGS CHALLENGING ON

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:31.689 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROVIDER NETWORK SO FOR

02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:33.691 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE- THE POTENTIAL

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:35.660 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL

ALREADY DISCUSSED IN THE

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:47.238 region:rollup2
HEARING TODAY. THE SORT OF

02:35:44.769 --> 02:35:52.543 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:35:47.238 --> 02:35:53.477 region:rollup2
DTS DIRECTIVES ACROSS REGIONAL.

JUST FAMILY ANDINDIVIDUALS

02:35:54.946 --> 02:35:58.916 region:rollup2

FLEXIBILITIES ALLOWED- THAT HAS

02:36:03.988 --> 02:36:07.825 region:rollup2
ALSO BEEN AN ISSUE THE THIRTY

02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:10.294 region:rollup2
DAY RENEWALS HAS CREATED SOME

02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:12.563 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN THE LACK

02:36:10.294 --> 02:36:14.232 region:rollup2
OF INFORMATION ABOUT ULTIMATE

02:36:12.563 --> 02:36:17.535 region:rollup2
RATE REFORM OR IMPLEMENTATION

02:36:14.232 --> 02:36:18.970 region:rollup2
OF THE RATE STUDY HAS BEEN AN

02:36:17.535 --> 02:36:20.271 region:rollup2
ISSUE RAISED TO OUR OFFICE.

02:36:18.970 --> 02:36:21.806 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT OVER THE

02:36:20.271 --> 02:36:24.675 region:rollup2
COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC SOME

02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:27.211 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HAVE Y. STAFF DUE TO

02:36:24.675 --> 02:36:28.813 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE- IN IN ADDITION TO

02:36:27.211 --> 02:36:30.081 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE REGULAR REASONS

02:36:28.813 --> 02:36:32.583 region:rollup2
THAT A PROVIDER MIGHT LOSE

02:36:30.081 --> 02:36:34.151 region:rollup2
STAFF- DURING THE PANDEMIC SOME

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:35.920 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OF LOS STAFF DUE TO

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:37.989 region:rollup2
FAMILIAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.491 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THEIR- CHILDREN

02:36:37.989 --> 02:36:42.159 region:rollup2
NOT BEING IN SCHOOL- OR DUE TO

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:44.295 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:46.664 region:rollup2
COVERT NINETEEN. SO I JUST

02:36:44.295 --> 02:36:48.666 region:rollup2
OFFER A FEW THOUGHTS ON ON

02:36:46.664 --> 02:36:49.934 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ACTION STEPS AND

02:36:48.666 --> 02:36:51.269 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF THESE HAVE ALREADY

02:36:49.934 --> 02:36:52.303 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY SO I'M NOT

02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:54.739 region:rollup2
GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME THERE

02:36:52.303 --> 02:36:56.073 region:rollup2
BUT- YOU KNOW EXTENDING SOME OF

02:36:54.739 --> 02:36:58.542 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTIVES FOR MORE THAN

02:36:56.073 --> 02:37:00.478 region:rollup2
THIRTY DAYS AT A TIME- COULD BE

02:36:58.542 --> 02:37:02.146 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY.

02:37:00.478 --> 02:37:04.048 region:rollup2
AND AS I ALREADY MENTIONED

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:05.316 region:rollup2
REJECTING THE SUPPOSE OF I'M

02:37:04.048 --> 02:37:07.485 region:rollup2
SORRY REJECTING THE PROPOSED

02:37:05.316 --> 02:37:10.588 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION LANGUAGE- COULD

02:37:07.485 --> 02:37:14.325 region:rollup2
HELP- WITHTHE SUSTAINABILITY

02:37:10.588 --> 02:37:15.826 region:rollup2
OF THE PER PROVIDER NETWORK-

02:37:14.325 --> 02:37:17.194 region:rollup2
YOU EVER. THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:37:15.826 --> 02:37:19.597 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON ITS LONG TERM

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:21.866 region:rollup2
STRATEGY- IN TERMS OF RATE

02:37:19.597 --> 02:37:25.036 region:rollup2
REFORM AND OR IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:37:21.866 --> 02:37:26.871 region:rollup2
THE RATE STUDY- AND IT WOULD

02:37:25.036 --> 02:37:30.708 region:rollup2
ALSO BE HELPFUL THAT. THE

02:37:26.871 --> 02:37:32.843 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN- REQUIRING

02:37:30.708 --> 02:37:35.646 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO SUBMIT THE

02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:37.615 region:rollup2
INFORMATION- PARTICULARLY IN

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:39.083 region:rollup2
THE AREA OF ALTERNATIVE

02:37:37.615 --> 02:37:42.053 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND NON RESIDENTIAL

02:37:39.083 --> 02:37:43.654 region:rollup2
SERVICES. TO SUBMIT INFORMATION

02:37:42.053 --> 02:37:45.756 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE DELIVERING

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:47.425 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND- I WOULD THINK IT

02:37:45.756 --> 02:37:48.492 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE

02:37:47.425 --> 02:37:51.062 region:rollup2
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:54.131 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF STAFF- THAT THEY HAVE

02:37:51.062 --> 02:37:56.801 region:rollup2
RETAINED OR LOST SO THAT THE-

02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:58.235 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE. HAS MORE

02:37:56.801 --> 02:38:01.072 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER LOTS

02:37:58.235 --> 02:38:02.740 region:rollup2
OF STAFF IS GOING TO BE A

02:38:01.072 --> 02:38:03.708 region:rollup2
SERIOUS PROBLEM POST PANDEMIC.

02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:05.142 region:rollup2
THE LAST QUESTION WE'VE BEEN

02:38:03.708 --> 02:38:07.511 region:rollup2
ASKED TO ADDRESS OUR POTENTIAL

02:38:05.142 --> 02:38:09.513 region:rollup2
IDEAS FOR THE FOR HOW THE DDS

02:38:07.511 --> 02:38:10.981 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODEL COULD CHANGE AS

02:38:09.513 --> 02:38:12.984 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF LESSONS LEARNED IN

02:38:10.981 --> 02:38:14.585 region:rollup2
THE PANDEMIC- THAT COULD

02:38:12.984 --> 02:38:16.954 region:rollup2
IMPROVE QUALITY OF SERVICES

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:19.990 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO SERVICES OR ADDRESS

02:38:16.954 --> 02:38:21.459 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES IN THE SYSTEM. SO

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:24.028 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- MISTER

02:38:21.459 --> 02:38:25.563 region:rollup2
NIGHT- MENTIONED IS AND SEVERAL

02:38:24.028 --> 02:38:27.665 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE MENTION TODAY IS

02:38:25.563 --> 02:38:31.569 region:rollup2
THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED

02:38:27.665 --> 02:38:32.970 region:rollup2
IN. INCREASED ARM FLEXIBILITY

02:38:31.569 --> 02:38:35.239 region:rollup2
IN SERVICE PROVISION AS WELL AS

02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:37.007 region:rollup2
A MORE PERSON CENTERED APPROACH

02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:40.044 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE. WHAT EACH

02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:43.814 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND CAN

02:38:40.044 --> 02:38:45.116 region:rollup2
HANDLE. I'M AND WE THINK THAT

02:38:43.814 --> 02:38:46.951 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY COULD SOME OF THOSE

02:38:45.116 --> 02:38:48.586 region:rollup2
LESSONS BE APPLIED OUTSIDE OF

02:38:46.951 --> 02:38:50.254 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF CONTEXT BUT IT

02:38:48.586 --> 02:38:52.223 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO HELP THE STATE AND

02:38:50.254 --> 02:38:54.892 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARD EACH CBS

02:38:52.223 --> 02:38:56.060 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE- AT THE SAME TIME

02:38:54.892 --> 02:38:57.428 region:rollup2
THE MORE FLEXIBLE AND

02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:58.629 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO

02:38:57.428 --> 02:38:59.997 region:rollup2
SERVICE DELIVERY DURING THE

02:38:58.629 --> 02:39:02.666 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC HAS RAISED SOME

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:03.334 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO DEFINE

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:05.469 region:rollup2
AND BILL FOR PARTICULAR

02:39:03.334 --> 02:39:07.738 region:rollup2
SERVICES. SO THERE IS SORT OF

02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:08.839 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:11.008 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THINGS LIKE THE

02:39:08.839 --> 02:39:13.377 region:rollup2
SERVICE CODE STRUCTURE- THE

02:39:11.008 --> 02:39:14.412 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROCESS USED TO THE

02:39:13.377 --> 02:39:16.313 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER

02:39:14.412 --> 02:39:19.116 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT USED TO ACCOUNT

02:39:16.313 --> 02:39:20.751 region:rollup2
FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND

02:39:19.116 --> 02:39:24.488 region:rollup2
JUST THE NOTION OF THESE HIGHLY

02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:26.357 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALIZED- SERVICE PLANS-

02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:27.658 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE AND THEN THE LAST

02:39:26.357 --> 02:39:29.560 region:rollup2
THING I WOULD JUST MENTION

02:39:27.658 --> 02:39:31.695 region:rollup2
WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE THE- THE

02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:33.564 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY. WELL ON

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:35.800 region:rollup2
ITS WAY TO YOU TRYING TO PUT

02:39:33.564 --> 02:39:37.435 region:rollup2
THIS INTO A REGULATIONS OR OR

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.438 region:rollup2
MAKE IT A MORE LONG TERM OPTION

02:39:37.435 --> 02:39:42.073 region:rollup2
IS JUST TO- CONSIDER THE

02:39:40.438 --> 02:39:45.009 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES OF

02:39:42.073 --> 02:39:47.344 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES-

02:39:45.009 --> 02:39:48.779 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THINK THAT- AS THE

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:50.381 region:rollup2
STATE'S ROLLING OUT THE SELF

02:39:48.779 --> 02:39:52.450 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION PROGRAM THIS IS

02:39:50.381 --> 02:39:54.452 region:rollup2
AN INTERESTING AREA OF POLICY

02:39:52.450 --> 02:39:56.120 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT MIGHT PROVIDE SOME.

02:39:54.452 --> 02:39:58.923 region:rollup2
GREATER AMOUNT OF CONTROL TO

02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.224 region:rollup2
THE FAMILIES AND- CONSUMERS WHO

02:39:58.923 --> 02:40:02.326 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO

02:40:00.224 --> 02:40:05.896 region:rollup2
THE ROUTE OF SELF DETERMINATION

02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:06.664 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD LIKE A GREATER SAY IN

02:40:05.896 --> 02:40:07.198 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR SERVICES. SO

02:40:06.664 --> 02:40:09.366 region:rollup2
FINALLY IN JUST GOING TO

02:40:07.198 --> 02:40:11.635 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THE DISPARITIES

02:40:09.366 --> 02:40:13.571 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND- MAYBE WHAT'S BEEN

02:40:11.635 --> 02:40:16.340 region:rollup2
LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC

02:40:13.571 --> 02:40:18.476 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HELP LATER ON. SO AS

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:20.811 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT- STATEWIDE THE

02:40:18.476 --> 02:40:22.546 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC HAS REALLY EXACERBATED

02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:23.747 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PRE EXISTING RACIAL

02:40:22.546 --> 02:40:25.382 region:rollup2
AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE

02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:26.884 region:rollup2
STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT

02:40:25.382 --> 02:40:28.552 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

02:40:26.884 --> 02:40:30.454 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES ALSO FACE THEIR

02:40:28.552 --> 02:40:31.455 region:rollup2
OWN SET OF DISPARITIES. AND

02:40:30.454 --> 02:40:33.591 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES CAN REALLY BE

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:35.426 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDED FOR A PERSON OF

02:40:33.591 --> 02:40:37.995 region:rollup2
COLOR WHO HAS A DEVELOPMENTAL

02:40:35.426 --> 02:40:40.464 region:rollup2
DISABILITY. SO JUST FOR A

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:41.899 region:rollup2
MOMENT LOOKING OUTSIDE OF DDS

02:40:40.464 --> 02:40:43.634 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE

02:40:41.899 --> 02:40:45.336 region:rollup2
SOME EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE

02:40:43.634 --> 02:40:47.071 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE

02:40:45.336 --> 02:40:50.341 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC ON PARTICULAR.

02:40:47.071 --> 02:40:51.575 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS WE YOU KNOW THERE

02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:53.043 region:rollup2
ARE STILL A VERY

02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:54.645 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF

02:40:53.043 --> 02:40:55.646 region:rollup2
CASES AND DEATHS ACROSS THE

02:40:54.645 --> 02:40:57.381 region:rollup2
STATE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

02:40:55.646 --> 02:40:58.816 region:rollup2
TARGETED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

02:40:57.381 --> 02:41:00.317 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. SO FOR

02:40:58.816 --> 02:41:02.353 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:41:00.317 --> 02:41:04.221 region:rollup2
TRIED TO INCREASE ITS EFFORTS

02:41:02.353 --> 02:41:06.190 region:rollup2
TO REACH PEOPLE SERVE QUORUM

02:41:04.221 --> 02:41:08.993 region:rollup2
COURT WHERE THEY ARE SO IN

02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:10.194 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS- THIS MIGHT INCLUDE

02:41:08.993 --> 02:41:11.662 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE A BETTER

02:41:10.194 --> 02:41:13.731 region:rollup2
TRANSLATION OF MATERIALS

02:41:11.662 --> 02:41:15.466 region:rollup2
TARGETED AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS

02:41:13.731 --> 02:41:17.468 region:rollup2
HIRING CONTACT TRACERS WAS.

02:41:15.466 --> 02:41:19.737 region:rollup2
CULTURAL COMPETENCY OFFERING

02:41:17.468 --> 02:41:20.804 region:rollup2
HOTEL ROOMS FOR QUARANTINING

02:41:19.737 --> 02:41:24.675 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WHO MAYBE DON'T HAVE

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:26.176 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO SELF ISOLATE.

02:41:24.675 --> 02:41:28.245 region:rollup2
SO- THERE LIKE LESS THAT CA BE

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:30.080 region:rollup2
TAKE FROM THESE EFFORTS AND

02:41:28.245 --> 02:41:32.349 region:rollup2
APPLIED OUTSIDE OF BOTH THE

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:36.554 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:38.155 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE DDS. SYSTEM WE HAVE

02:41:36.554 --> 02:41:40.057 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED TO THE

02:41:38.155 --> 02:41:41.659 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THAT IT FUND A

02:41:40.057 --> 02:41:43.360 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE AFTER ACTION

02:41:41.659 --> 02:41:44.962 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:46.997 region:rollup2
TO COPE IN NINETEEN THROUGH THE

02:41:44.962 --> 02:41:48.299 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN

02:41:46.997 --> 02:41:49.700 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION

02:55:18.541 --> 02:55:21.978 region:rollup2
DRASTIC. THE IMPACTS WOULD BE

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:24.614 region:rollup2
MUCH WORSE HOWEVER IF IT

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:25.248 region:rollup2
WEREN'T FOR THE HERO WITH THEM

02:55:24.614 --> 02:55:27.150 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN DISPLAYED UP AND

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:29.185 region:rollup2
DOWN THE STATE. BY OUR DIRECT

02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:30.887 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS THEY HAVE

02:55:38.928 --> 02:55:41.431 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE THAT IS

PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN AND WOMEN

OF COLOR. AND THEY HAVE BEEN

02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:47.270 region:rollup2
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

02:55:45.001 --> 02:55:48.772 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL IN OUR RESPONSE TO

02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:49.973 region:rollup2
THIS PANDEMIC. AND THEY HAVE

02:55:48.772 --> 02:55:52.542 region:rollup2
MADE THE SACRIFICES WHILE

02:55:49.973 --> 02:55:54.844 region:rollup2
EARNING NEAR OR AT MINIMUM WAGE

02:55:52.542 --> 02:55:56.279 region:rollup2
DUE TO LOW RATES. AND AS WE

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:58.481 region:rollup2
KNOW MINIMUM WAGE CALIFORNIA IS

02:55:56.279 --> 02:56:00.250 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO GO UP AGAIN BUT IN OUR

02:55:58.481 --> 02:56:02.218 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THIS INCREASES APPLIED

02:56:00.250 --> 02:56:03.219 region:rollup2
IN IN AN EQUITABLE. AND

02:56:02.218 --> 02:56:05.488 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PERVERSE METHOD

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:06.823 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME ORGANIZATIONS WILL

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:08.124 region:rollup2
RECEIVE AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS

02:56:06.823 --> 02:56:09.726 region:rollup2
TO OFFSET THE INCREASE THE

02:56:08.124 --> 02:56:11.294 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE IN SOMEWHAT. THAT

02:56:09.726 --> 02:56:12.595 region:rollup2
MEANS SOME OF THESE ESSENTIAL

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:14.831 region:rollup2
HEROES WILL RECEIVE WAGE

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:16.666 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND SOME WALKED. AND

02:56:14.831 --> 02:56:17.934 region:rollup2
THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY MR

02:56:16.666 --> 02:56:19.602 region:rollup2
KNIGHT'S COMMENTS WHICH

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:22.038 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED THE IMMENSE UNDER

02:56:19.602 --> 02:56:22.806 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION OF THE BUDGETED

02:56:22.038 --> 02:56:25.175 region:rollup2

FROM ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN TO

FINALLY MAKE THIS METHOD

02:56:28.545 --> 02:56:32.515 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE. INTO INCENTIVIZE

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:34.350 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS TO PAY HIGHER

02:56:32.515 --> 02:56:35.685 region:rollup2
WAGE INSTEAD OF WHAT WE

02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:37.587 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DO TO INCENTIVIZE

02:56:35.685 --> 02:56:39.656 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS TO KEEP STAFF AT

02:56:37.587 --> 02:56:41.858 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE. THIS WOULD BE

02:56:39.656 --> 02:56:43.226 region:rollup2
DONE BY STANDARD THE STANDARD

02:56:41.858 --> 02:56:45.361 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE INCREASE TO LOW WAGE

02:56:43.226 --> 02:56:46.362 region:rollup2
EARNERS REGARDLESS IF YOU MAKE

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:48.164 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE OR MORE THAN

02:56:46.362 --> 02:56:50.100 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE. IT MAKES SENSE

02:56:48.164 --> 02:56:51.034 region:rollup2
AND IT PROVIDES EQUITY NOW IS

02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:52.869 region:rollup2
THE TIME FOR THE STATE TO

02:56:51.034 --> 02:56:54.270 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE OUTDATED AND

02:56:52.869 --> 02:56:56.039 region:rollup2
INEQUITABLE COMPENSATION

02:56:54.270 --> 02:56:57.407 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY WITH THE UNIFORMITY

02:56:56.039 --> 02:56:58.541 region:rollup2
JUST MEANT. THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:56:57.407 --> 02:57:00.643 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO PAY COMPETITIVE

02:56:58.541 --> 02:57:04.614 region:rollup2

MOST. THE LEGISLATURE ANY

AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:00:31.154 --> 03:00:34.524 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

03:00:32.655 --> 03:00:35.458 region:rollup2

POINT EIGHT BILLION TO ONE

03:00:36.826 --> 03:00:40.363 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR BILLION. AND WE'RE

03:00:38.528 --> 03:00:42.365 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO MAKE MORE WE WERE

03:00:40.363 --> 03:00:43.366 region:rollup2

03:00:42.365 --> 03:00:45.635 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THE RATE

03:00:48.471 --> 03:00:52.709 region:rollup2
A POLICY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

03:00:50.039 --> 03:00:55.144 region:rollup2
OF THE RATE STUDY. MR SIEGMAN

03:00:52.709 --> 03:00:56.212 region:rollup2
USE THAT THE PHRASE NORTHSTAR

03:00:55.144 --> 03:00:58.281 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO STEAL THAT AND

03:00:56.212 --> 03:00:59.882 region:rollup2
STAY OFF AS WE DID CLOSE

03:00:58.281 --> 03:01:01.617 region:rollup2

A PART OF THAT NORTH STAR AND

03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:06.255 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T FORGET THAT AND PUT IT

03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:08.091 region:rollup2
ON THE SHELF. OTHERWISE THIS

03:01:06.255 --> 03:01:09.859 region:rollup2
WOULD BE YET ANOTHER STUDY THAT

03:01:08.091 --> 03:01:11.361 region:rollup2
CONFIRMS YES CALIFORNIA'S

03:01:09.859 --> 03:01:12.962 region:rollup2

ALREADY EXISTING STAFFIG

03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:55.157 region:rollup2
CRISIS. ANOTHER LAYER OF

UNCERTAINTY FOR STAFFING WAS

03:03:55.157 --> 03:03:57.593 region:rollup2

THIS DEADLY PANDEMIC WHAT WOULD

HAPPEN IF THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP.

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:35.131 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE RECEIVING SERVICES

03:04:33.095 --> 03:04:36.532 region:rollup2

WE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY

03:04:36.532 --> 03:04:39.602 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TRAINING FOR THEM TO

BECOME INFECTION CONTROL

03:04:39.602 --> 03:04:44.440 region:rollup2

03:04:41.604 --> 03:04:46.375 region:rollup2
P. COULD BE SECURE SANITATION

03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:48.511 region:rollup2

OFFICERS OUR STAFF DID SHOW UP

03:04:52.248 --> 03:04:54.784 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY COULD BE

03:04:53.482 --> 03:04:56.419 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND

03:04:54.784 --> 03:04:58.321 region:rollup2
DEATH FOR THEIR CLIENTS NOT

03:04:56.419 --> 03:04:59.722 region:rollup2
ONLY DID THEY SHOW UP. THEY

03:04:58.321 --> 03:05:00.823 region:rollup2
BECAME THE BACKBONE OF THE

03:04:59.722 --> 03:05:03.259 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH

SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN

03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:11.233 region:rollup2
THE HIDDEN WORKFORCE THEY DID

03:05:09.632 --> 03:05:12.268 region:rollup2
NOT GET THE RECOGNITION OF THE

WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THEY

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:19.041 region:rollup2
INVALUABLE. I THINK IT'S

03:05:18.107 --> 03:05:20.309 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE'RE

03:05:19.041 --> 03:05:21.444 region:rollup2

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:43.666 region:rollup2
NOT WANT TO ADMIT DOM. BECAUSE

IN TWO SHORT YEARS. IT JUST

03:13:39.341 --> 03:13:42.044 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON HELPING

03:13:40.476 --> 03:13:44.313 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS MAKE THE CHANGES

03:13:42.044 --> 03:13:46.782 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE

THEY CAN ASK FOR HELP DURING A

03:14:08.337 --> 03:14:11.773 region:rollup2
CRISIS. I HOPE MY TESTIMONY

03:14:10.105 --> 03:14:13.742 region:rollup2
MAKES CLEAR THAT OUR SYSTEM IS

03:14:11.773 --> 03:14:15.110 region:rollup2

UNDER FUNDING OF SERVICES AND

03:21:26.541 --> 03:21:32.547 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND GOING FORWARD WITH

03:21:28.577 --> 03:21:33.915 region:rollup2
THE AND KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT

SIMILARITY IS PROP NINETY EIGHT

03:22:27.669 --> 03:22:32.107 region:rollup2

03:25:24.913 --> 03:25:28.616 region:rollup2
SIDE I HAVE HEARD SOME

03:25:26.881 --> 03:25:31.553 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL YOU KNOW EVIDENCE

03:25:28.616 --> 03:25:32.754 region:rollup2
THAT- PROVIDERS HAVE TAKEN THIS

03:25:31.553 --> 03:25:34.589 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY AT THE

03:25:32.754 --> 03:25:36.090 region:rollup2
END OF. MAYBE THEIR CAREER IN

03:25:34.589 --> 03:25:38.927 region:rollup2
GROUP HOMES TO TAKE THE

03:25:36.090 --> 03:25:41.296 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO RETIRE- WHICH

03:25:38.927 --> 03:25:43.298 region:rollup2
HAS- HAS CREATED DEFINITE

03:25:41.296 --> 03:25:45.366 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES. ONE OF THINGS WE

03:25:43.298 --> 03:25:48.069 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE IN THIS SYSTEM WHICH

03:25:45.366 --> 03:25:49.504 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK. ON IS

03:25:48.069 --> 03:25:51.840 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF RESCUE HOUSING

03:25:49.504 --> 03:25:54.442 region:rollup2
WHERE AN OWNER OPERATED GROUP

03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:56.110 region:rollup2
HOME- DECIDES IT'S THE END OF

03:25:54.442 --> 03:25:57.845 region:rollup2
THEIR TWENTY OR THIRTY OR MORE

03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:59.514 region:rollup2
YEAR TEN YEAR OF BEING ABLE TO

03:25:57.845 --> 03:26:01.382 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEIR INDIVIDUALS. WE

03:25:59.514 --> 03:26:03.351 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY HAVE A MECHANISM

03:26:01.382 --> 03:26:05.486 region:rollup2
TO RESCUE THAT HOUSING UNLESS

03:26:03.351 --> 03:26:07.355 region:rollup2
THAT- OWNER OPERATOR HAS

03:26:05.486 --> 03:26:09.557 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE USUALLY IN THE

03:26:07.355 --> 03:26:11.593 region:rollup2
FAMILY TO PASS IT ON TO IT SO-

03:26:09.557 --> 03:26:13.094 region:rollup2
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS. PART OF THE

03:26:11.593 --> 03:26:15.263 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AND AFFORDABLE AND

03:26:13.094 --> 03:26:16.531 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING IS A HUGE

03:26:15.263 --> 03:26:17.966 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SOLUTION I THINK

03:26:16.531 --> 03:26:20.401 region:rollup2
IT'S- AS WE MOVE INTO THE

03:26:17.966 --> 03:26:21.236 region:rollup2

03:26:20.401 --> 03:26:23.171 region:rollup2
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

03:26:21.236 --> 03:26:24.672 region:rollup2
AND- AND- AFFORDABLE AND

03:26:23.171 --> 03:26:26.407 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE HOUSING A MULTI

03:26:24.672 --> 03:26:28.176 region:rollup2

03:26:30.712 --> 03:26:38.653 region:rollup2
INCLUDING OURS. WILL BE. A

03:26:37.785 --> 03:26:40.555 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PART OF. RELATING NEW

SOME Mà. STARTED TO YOUR ARM

03:26:43.658 --> 03:26:47.762 region:rollup2

03:26:44.792 --> 03:26:49.197 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM- WE DON'T HAVE A

03:26:47.762 --> 03:26:51.165 region:rollup2
GOOD WAY IT'S BEEN STATED MANY

03:26:49.197 --> 03:26:53.034 region:rollup2

03:26:57.872 --> 03:27:01.843 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS OF A STUDY OF

03:26:59.607 --> 03:27:03.845 region:rollup2
CLOSURES OF. PROGRAMS EVERY

03:27:01.843 --> 03:27:05.880 region:rollup2
YEAR- BUT IT TAKES TIME FOR

03:27:03.845 --> 03:27:09.250 region:rollup2
THAT TO SHOW ANY KIND OF-

03:27:05.880 --> 03:27:11.352 region:rollup2

STARTED MY CAREER AS A DRUG

03:32:15.856 --> 03:32:21.562 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROFESSIONAL- I

03:32:19.126 --> 03:32:22.964 region:rollup2

DEDICATED AND IT'S REALLY

03:32:35.543 --> 03:32:40.681 region:rollup2
SACRIFICE SOME OF THEIR TIMES

03:32:37.211 --> 03:32:42.049 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY MOVING TO SEE THOSE

03:32:40.681 --> 03:32:43.451 region:rollup2
WORK. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO

03:32:42.049 --> 03:32:45.586 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SYSTEM

03:32:43.451 --> 03:32:47.455 region:rollup2

03:32:49.991 --> 03:32:54.495 region:rollup2
PANDEMIC- AND FINDING- ARE

03:32:52.593 --> 03:32:57.365 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN A

03:32:54.495 --> 03:33:00.968 region:rollup2
BENEFIT- TO BE ABLE TO HELP

03:32:57.365 --> 03:33:02.970 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE I. WELL I DON'T HAVE A

03:33:00.968 --> 03:33:05.106 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR STRATEGIES- WE ARE

03:33:02.970 --> 03:33:06.741 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR-

03:33:05.106 --> 03:33:07.875 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE BUT ALSO WORKING

03:33:06.741 --> 03:33:09.710 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN

03:33:07.875 --> 03:33:11.245 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE

03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:12.747 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND

03:33:11.245 --> 03:33:15.583 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT OUR POST AND THEN

03:33:12.747 --> 03:33:16.851 region:rollup2
MAKE- FUTURE- WHAT WHAT IS KIND

03:33:15.583 --> 03:33:18.285 region:rollup2
OF THAT. YOU KNOW WE STARTED

03:33:16.851 --> 03:33:20.187 region:rollup2
THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SIX

03:33:18.285 --> 03:33:22.189 region:rollup2
MONTHS AGO AND REALIZED IT WAS

03:33:20.187 --> 03:33:23.224 region:rollup2
TOO SOON TO BE ABLE TO AND I

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:25.559 region:rollup2
THINK WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE

03:33:23.224 --> 03:33:27.495 region:rollup2
OF IT- BUT- WE NEED TO

03:33:25.559 --> 03:33:29.830 region:rollup2
REIMAGINE SOME EFFORTS AND

03:33:27.495 --> 03:33:31.932 region:rollup2
REALLY- UC'S OPPORTUNITIES TO

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:33.801 region:rollup2

INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

03:33:37.271 --> 03:33:41.876 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE AND- REALLY DO HOPE

03:33:39.907 --> 03:33:42.576 region:rollup2
THAT OUR OUR STAFF THAT ARE OUT

03:33:41.876 --> 03:33:44.812 region:rollup2

SOME WORK LIFE BALANCE BECAUSE

03:33:44.812 --> 03:33:48.449 region:rollup2
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A VERY

03:33:47.882 --> 03:33:49.717 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT. ABOUT EARLIER WE

03:33:48.449 --> 03:33:52.820 region:rollup2
HEARD OF THE NEED FOR US TO

03:33:49.717 --> 03:33:54.355 region:rollup2
BUILD BACK BETTER AND- I REALLY

03:33:52.820 --> 03:33:55.956 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT BRINGS US INTO A

03:33:54.355 --> 03:33:58.459 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT NEXT STEPS

03:33:55.956 --> 03:34:00.394 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE RATE STUDY. I

03:33:58.459 --> 03:34:02.296 region:rollup2
WANTED THE FIRST TASK IS THE

03:34:00.394 --> 03:34:04.165 region:rollup2
RATE STUDY OUR NORTH STAR HOW

03:34:02.296 --> 03:34:06.701 region:rollup2
ARE WE- WORKING TOWARDS

03:34:04.165 --> 03:34:08.836 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THAT TRADE STUDY. AND

03:34:06.701 --> 03:34:10.104 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD WHAT DIRECTIONS WITH

03:34:08.836 --> 03:34:12.740 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN STUDY NATURALLY

03:34:10.104 --> 03:34:15.643 region:rollup2
POINTS TO US AS A NEXT STEP IN

03:34:12.740 --> 03:34:20.614 region:rollup2
RATES IMPROVEMENTS. IF ONE

03:34:15.643 --> 03:34:23.484 region:rollup2
COULD BE CONSIDERED. YEAH THANK

03:34:20.614 --> 03:34:26.654 region:rollup2
YOU- DOCTOR AMBULANCE SO- WE

03:34:23.484 --> 03:34:27.555 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY OR PLAN

03:34:26.654 --> 03:34:28.622 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME FOR THE

03:34:27.555 --> 03:34:31.125 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE

03:34:28.622 --> 03:34:32.960 region:rollup2
STUDY BUT AS WE HAVE. I'M USED

03:34:31.125 --> 03:34:36.130 region:rollup2
TO PRIOR- CONVERSATIONS IN THE

03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:38.132 region:rollup2
LAST COUPLE YEARS- WE REALLY

03:34:36.130 --> 03:34:40.201 region:rollup2
ARE FOCUSED ON USING THE

03:34:38.132 --> 03:34:42.103 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT HAS INFORMED

03:34:40.201 --> 03:34:44.605 region:rollup2
US ON SOME REALLY CRITICAL

03:34:42.103 --> 03:34:46.507 region:rollup2
PARTS ABOUT OUR SYSTEM- I DO

03:34:44.605 --> 03:34:48.609 region:rollup2
SEE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

03:34:46.507 --> 03:34:50.544 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT. HOW DO WE GET

03:34:48.609 --> 03:34:53.247 region:rollup2
TO A STRATEGY OF DELIVERING

03:34:50.544 --> 03:34:55.249 region:rollup2
SERVICES- IN A WAY THAT IS

03:34:53.247 --> 03:34:58.052 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON OUTCOMES AND

03:34:55.249 --> 03:34:59.954 region:rollup2
PERSON- FOCUSED AND- THE

03:34:58.052 --> 03:35:01.188 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT HAS ALSO BEEN

03:34:59.954 --> 03:35:03.057 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO US THROUGH THE RATE

03:35:01.188 --> 03:35:04.825 region:rollup2
STUDY IS INFORMATIVE AND SHOULD

03:35:03.057 --> 03:35:07.461 region:rollup2
HELP US IN IN GUIDING OUR

03:35:04.825 --> 03:35:09.263 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS- SO AGAIN WE LOOK

03:35:07.461 --> 03:35:12.166 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO. KIND OF DIVING INTO

03:35:09.263 --> 03:35:14.468 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE DETAILS. WE HAVE

03:35:12.166 --> 03:35:16.737 region:rollup2
A COMPLICATED SYSTEM. I'M AND

03:35:14.468 --> 03:35:19.373 region:rollup2
THAT COMPLICATED SYSTEM- GOT

03:35:16.737 --> 03:35:21.242 region:rollup2
MAGNIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC- AND

03:35:19.373 --> 03:35:23.144 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO PRIORITIZE

03:35:21.242 --> 03:35:25.846 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

03:35:23.144 --> 03:35:26.947 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD- AND

03:35:25.846 --> 03:35:32.019 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN

03:35:26.947 --> 03:35:32.486 region:rollup2
THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH- OUR.

03:35:32.019 --> 03:35:34.155 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND WITH THE

03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:35.623 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. I FOUND IT-

03:35:34.155 --> 03:35:37.525 region:rollup2
POWERFUL WHEN WE HEARD EARLIER

03:35:35.623 --> 03:35:39.360 region:rollup2
THAT HISTORICAL UNDERFUNDING

03:35:37.525 --> 03:35:41.228 region:rollup2
MADE IMPLEMENTATION DIFFICULT

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:44.265 region:rollup2
DURING THIS PANDEMIC I THINK

03:35:41.228 --> 03:35:46.634 region:rollup2
THAT'S- AN IMPORTANT PART FOR

03:35:44.265 --> 03:35:48.936 region:rollup2
US TO OWN AS A STATE- IN THIS

03:35:46.634 --> 03:35:50.938 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND HOPE WE CAN

03:35:48.936 --> 03:35:54.208 region:rollup2
TAKE TO- NEXT STEPS TOGETHER

03:35:50.938 --> 03:35:55.142 region:rollup2
AND- REALIZING THIS RATE STUDY

03:35:54.208 --> 03:35:57.411 region:rollup2
IN THE NEED FOR IT WITHIN OUR

03:35:55.142 --> 03:35:58.646 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. I WOULD LIKE TO END IF

03:35:57.411 --> 03:36:00.548 region:rollup2
I CAN ON THE COMMUNITY

03:35:58.646 --> 03:36:04.018 region:rollup2
NAVIGATOR PROPOSAL I WAS QUITE

03:36:00.548 --> 03:36:06.387 region:rollup2
PLEASED WITH IT AND- IF I CAN I

03:36:04.018 --> 03:36:08.222 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SUB

03:36:06.387 --> 03:36:10.691 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE RECEIVE A COPY OF THE

03:36:08.222 --> 03:36:13.360 region:rollup2
PROMO TORA EVALUATION WHICH WAS

03:36:10.691 --> 03:36:15.429 region:rollup2
REFERENCED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR

03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:17.698 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL. BUT WANTED TO

03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:19.967 region:rollup2
ASK THE- ADMINISTRATION IF I

03:36:17.698 --> 03:36:21.202 region:rollup2
COULD HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT

03:36:19.967 --> 03:36:23.437 region:rollup2
THIS NUMBER FOR THE INVESTMENT

03:36:21.202 --> 03:36:26.874 region:rollup2
TEND TO THE ARGUMENT TO BE MADE

03:36:23.437 --> 03:36:29.343 region:rollup2
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS

03:36:26.874 --> 03:36:30.578 region:rollup2
PURPOSE AND IF NOT WHY NOT. YES

03:36:29.343 --> 03:36:33.380 region:rollup2
MAY BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE

03:36:30.578 --> 03:36:35.749 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE- THE STUDY THAT IS

03:36:33.380 --> 03:36:37.485 region:rollup2
REFERENCED AND I'M ON THE

03:36:35.749 --> 03:36:40.187 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN PROVIDE

03:36:37.485 --> 03:36:41.455 region:rollup2

WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:36:45.793 --> 03:36:49.597 region:rollup2
TOUCH ALL TWENTY ONE GEOGRAPHIC

03:36:48.028 --> 03:36:52.299 region:rollup2
AREAS AND SO THE ASSUMPTION IS

03:36:49.597 --> 03:36:54.134 region:rollup2
BASED ON TWENTY ONE- PHYSICIANS

03:36:52.299 --> 03:36:56.504 region:rollup2

BE RELATED TO THAT- AND THEN

03:37:03.143 --> 03:37:06.313 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT MAKING SURE AS

03:37:04.512 --> 03:37:07.515 region:rollup2

03:37:06.313 --> 03:37:09.917 region:rollup2

03:37:09.917 --> 03:37:13.754 region:rollup2
BE FURTHER DEFINED THROUGH

03:37:11.151 --> 03:37:15.856 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE AS FAR AS- IT JUST

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:17.758 region:rollup2
SMALL- IT'S ONE OF THE AREAS

03:37:15.856 --> 03:37:19.226 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS REALLY WANTING TO DO

03:37:17.758 --> 03:37:20.661 region:rollup2
WAS TO STANDARDIZE SOMETHING

03:37:19.226 --> 03:37:22.997 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE SO WHAT WOULD

03:37:20.661 --> 03:37:25.266 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TIME TO BE A- ABLE TO

03:37:22.997 --> 03:37:26.700 region:rollup2
EVALUATE- IT WAS NOTED ABOUT

03:37:25.266 --> 03:37:28.502 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH

03:37:26.700 --> 03:37:30.871 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO USE. AS OUR-

03:37:28.502 --> 03:37:32.873 region:rollup2
MEASURES- UP FRONT SO WE'RE

03:37:30.871 --> 03:37:34.942 region:rollup2
ABLE TO REALLY MONITOR THE

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:36.510 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AND THE OUTCOMES ON

03:37:34.942 --> 03:37:37.878 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HELP INFORM US AS TO

03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:40.648 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER

03:37:37.878 --> 03:37:42.550 region:rollup2

ON THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

03:37:53.127 --> 03:38:00.401 region:rollup2
NEED TO MODIFY- BEFORE WE WOULD

REGARDING THE VACCINE IN THE

POSSIBILITY OF MOVING THAT

MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE UP- I

03:53:31.231 --> 03:53:35.168 region:rollup2
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OCCURRING

03:53:32.699 --> 03:53:36.169 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHY. IN EARLY JANUARY

03:53:35.168 --> 03:53:37.604 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY I SPENT EIGHTY

03:53:36.169 --> 03:53:39.038 region:rollup2
THAT THE BAD SIDE OF MY TWENTY

03:53:37.604 --> 03:53:40.640 region:rollup2
TWO YEAR OLD SON JOHNNY AS HE

03:53:39.038 --> 03:53:42.375 region:rollup2
LAY INTUBATED ON A VENTILATOR

03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:44.377 region:rollup2
IN THE ICU FROM AN UNKNOWN

03:53:42.375 --> 03:53:45.612 region:rollup2
ILLNESS. MOST LIKELY WAS COLD

03:53:44.377 --> 03:53:46.846 region:rollup2
IT NOW KNOWING THAT WE KNOW

03:53:45.612 --> 03:53:48.681 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS WHAT NOW KNOWING

03:53:46.846 --> 03:53:49.849 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS VIRUS.

03:53:48.681 --> 03:53:51.784 region:rollup2
I KNOW HOW FIRSTHAND HOW

03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:53.686 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND SEVERELY PEOPLE

03:53:51.784 --> 03:53:55.154 region:rollup2
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

03:53:53.686 --> 03:53:57.156 region:rollup2
AND COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS CAN

03:53:55.154 --> 03:53:58.925 region:rollup2
BECOME SICK. I FEEL STRONGLY

03:53:57.156 --> 03:54:00.593 region:rollup2
THAT THE VACCINE SHOULD INCLUDE

03:53:58.925 --> 03:54:02.462 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH ALL DEVELOPMENTAL

03:54:00.593 --> 03:54:04.197 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES BECAUSE SO OFTEN

03:54:02.462 --> 03:54:05.798 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR

03:54:04.197 --> 03:54:07.267 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TO EXPRESS WHEN THEY

03:54:05.798 --> 03:54:09.035 region:rollup2
DO NOT FEEL WELL AND OFTEN

03:54:07.267 --> 03:54:11.070 region:rollup2
TIMES IT IS NOT UNTIL THEY'RE

03:54:09.035 --> 03:54:13.873 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY SICK. THAT THEIR CARE

03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:14.674 region:rollup2
GIVERS REALIZE SOMETHING IS

03:54:13.873 --> 03:54:17.443 region:rollup2
WRONG. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE IN

03:54:14.674 --> 03:54:18.077 region:rollup2
MINUTES. THAT THEY DECIDED TO

03:54:17.443 --> 03:54:20.413 region:rollup2
INCLUDE SOME OF OUR DISABILITY

03:54:18.077 --> 03:54:22.215 region:rollup2

03:54:20.413 --> 03:54:23.283 region:rollup2
SINCE DECEMBER TWO MONTHS AGO

03:54:22.215 --> 03:54:25.218 region:rollup2
THE DEATH RATE FOR REGIONAL

CENTER CONSUMERS HAS RISEN

03:54:25.218 --> 03:54:29.923 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY. WAITING UNTIL

MARCH FIFTEENTH MEANS THAT IF.

03:54:29.923 --> 03:54:32.825 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY

03:54:31.558 --> 03:54:34.360 region:rollup2
IS ABLE TO GET VACCINATED ON

03:54:32.825 --> 03:54:36.362 region:rollup2
THAT DAY IT WOULD BE A MINIMUM

03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:37.463 region:rollup2
OF NINE TO TEN WEEKS. BEFORE

03:54:36.362 --> 03:54:40.300 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON WOULD BE FULLY

03:54:37.463 --> 03:54:41.601 region:rollup2
VACCINATED AND SAVED FROM

03:54:40.300 --> 03:54:42.802 region:rollup2
SERIOUS HEALTH COMPLICATIONS.

03:54:41.601 --> 03:54:44.470 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT

03:54:42.802 --> 03:54:45.505 region:rollup2
OF VACCINE RIGHT NOW I WOULD

03:54:44.470 --> 03:54:47.206 region:rollup2

FIRST CONCERN- WHICH REGARDING

THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT DID IT

04:47:38.074 --> 04:47:44.848 region:rollup2
JANUARY THIRTEENTH HALF OF

04:47:42.946 --> 04:47:46.416 region:rollup2
WHERE IT WAS- YOU KNOW OUR-

04:47:44.848 --> 04:47:51.988 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS

WERE TOLD THAT. IF WE HAVE ANY-

04:47:51.988 --> 04:47:55.458 region:rollup2
CLIENT THAT'S PART OF THE

04:47:53.690 --> 04:47:58.261 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER- WE COULD

QUALIFY FOR THE VACCINE AND IT

04:47:58.261 --> 04:48:03.800 region:rollup2
WAS VERY SPECIFIC- IN REGARDS

04:48:01.364 --> 04:48:06.436 region:rollup2
TO THE DIAGNOSIS THAT I AM

04:48:03.800 --> 04:48:07.971 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED. AND SO MY FIRST

04:48:06.436 --> 04:48:09.772 region:rollup2
CONCERN REGARDING THIS LETTER

04:48:07.971 --> 04:48:12.742 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THE LETTER I WILL

04:48:09.772 --> 04:48:14.377 region:rollup2
NEVER I NEVER SIDE IN SPANISH.

04:48:12.742 --> 04:48:17.580 region:rollup2
AND GOING BACK TO THE POINT

04:48:14.377 --> 04:48:19.282 region:rollup2
THAT JUDY MARC SNEYD- YEAR- A

04:48:17.580 --> 04:48:21.217 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE INFORMATION DID NOT

04:48:19.282 --> 04:48:22.585 region:rollup2
GET PASSED ON TO EVERYBODY SO A

04:48:21.217 --> 04:48:24.320 region:rollup2
LOT OF PEOPLE EITHER DID NOT

RECEIVE THE LETTER OR THE

04:48:24.320 --> 04:48:28.258 region:rollup2
LETTER WHICH NOT IN SPANISH SO

04:48:26.422 --> 04:48:30.260 region:rollup2

04:48:28.258 --> 04:48:32.028 region:rollup2
SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATION.

04:48:30.260 --> 04:48:34.631 region:rollup2
BUT NOT AWARE JUSTICE THAT THIS

04:48:32.028 --> 04:48:37.267 region:rollup2
WAS HAPPENING- MY CONCERN

04:48:34.631 --> 04:48:38.968 region:rollup2
REGARDING THEIR IN FACT IT HAS

04:48:37.267 --> 04:48:40.537 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME AT LEAST

04:48:38.968 --> 04:48:43.773 region:rollup2
WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT

04:48:40.537 --> 04:48:46.075 region:rollup2
AUTISM DOES NOT FALL UNDER. THE

04:48:43.773 --> 04:48:48.745 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES HERE- OUTLANDISH

04:48:46.075 --> 04:48:50.580 region:rollup2
LETTERS HOWEVER WE HAVE HEARD

04:48:48.745 --> 04:48:52.182 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS

04:48:50.580 --> 04:48:54.784 region:rollup2

04:48:52.182 --> 04:48:56.452 region:rollup2
THE VACCINE WHEN THERE ARE

04:48:54.784 --> 04:49:00.557 region:rollup2

DIAGNOSES AND FELL. I'M JUST I

04:49:00.557 --> 04:49:04.060 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE

04:49:02.392 --> 04:49:05.695 region:rollup2
THIS INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE

04:49:04.060 --> 04:49:07.530 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION THAT

04:49:05.695 --> 04:49:09.465 region:rollup2
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND

04:49:07.530 --> 04:49:11.601 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY TYPICAL TO STUFF THAT

04:49:09.465 --> 04:49:13.303 region:rollup2
HAPPENS- WHEN WE REQUEST FOR

04:49:18.241 --> 04:49:21.978 region:rollup2
OTHER FAMILIES DO NOT IN THIS

04:49:19.809 --> 04:49:23.546 region:rollup2
CASE. SOME FAMILIES WE HAVE

04:49:21.978 --> 04:49:25.515 region:rollup2

ONLY HAS AN AUTISM DIAGNOSIS

04:49:25.515 --> 04:49:28.885 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T QUALIFY BASED ON

04:49:27.217 --> 04:49:31.187 region:rollup2
THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT FROM

04:49:28.885 --> 04:49:32.422 region:rollup2

DETERMINATION AND WE'VE HAD

04:55:55.171 --> 04:56:00.142 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH-

04:55:57.340 --> 04:56:02.411 region:rollup2
GETTING- EVERYTHING IN PLACE

04:56:00.142 --> 04:56:04.780 region:rollup2
AND- TRANSPLANTATION FROM THE

04:56:02.411 --> 04:56:07.183 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM. INTO FAULT

04:56:04.780 --> 04:56:09.085 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AND IT. IN MY

NAVIGATING SYSTEMS OF CARE WITH

04:56:10.720 --> 04:56:14.190 region:rollup2
MY OWN CHILDREN BUT SUPPORTING

04:56:12.088 --> 04:56:15.725 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND FAMILY MEMBERS. I

04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:17.393 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT

04:56:15.725 --> 04:56:18.227 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THOSE ARE OUR

04:56:17.393 --> 04:56:19.829 region:rollup2
SERVICE COORDINATORS ARE

04:56:18.227 --> 04:56:22.265 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT

04:56:19.829 --> 04:56:24.934 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY PREPARED. AND THAT

04:56:22.265 --> 04:56:27.203 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPACTING THE WAY BOB

04:56:24.934 --> 04:56:28.237 region:rollup2
FOR PROGRAMMING- BEING

04:56:27.203 --> 04:56:30.806 region:rollup2

IMPLEMENTED. OUT PROPERLY-

04:56:30.806 --> 04:56:33.909 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I SEE THAT I

04:56:32.842 --> 04:56:35.845 region:rollup2

04:56:45.121 --> 04:56:48.557 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE DELIVERY SERVICE AND

04:56:47.356 --> 04:56:50.526 region:rollup2

WHO ARE REALLY AT. A

04:56:53.729 --> 04:56:56.299 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO

04:56:55.197 --> 04:56:58.768 region:rollup2

FOR A LOT OF SERVICE

04:57:03.773 --> 04:57:07.243 region:rollup2

THEY COULDN'T HELP. THEY KNOW

05:14:57.312 --> 05:15:00.815 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY MEMBER TO HAVE THE

05:14:58.780 --> 05:15:02.350 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THEY NEED SO THEY CAN

05:15:00.815 --> 05:15:03.718 region:rollup2
LIVE IN LOS ANGELES SO THEY

COULD LIVE IN ORANGE COUNTY

05:15:03.718 --> 05:15:06.521 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT

05:15:04.719 --> 05:15:08.690 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING IS PUSHING US

05:15:06.521 --> 05:15:09.591 region:rollup2
