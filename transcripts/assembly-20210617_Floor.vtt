01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:42.064
FROM EVERYONE ELSE. THE IDEAS

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.866
FROM HISTORY THAT THIS COUNTRY

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:48.337
FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THE EUROPEAN

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.673
COLONIZERS THAT CAME HERE WITH

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.007
THE FIRST ONES HERE WHILE THE

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.243
NATIVE AMERICANS WHO WERE HERE

01:06:54.310 --> 01:07:00.816
FIRST WORD NOR. THE FACT THAT.

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:03.052
THERE WAS A BLACK WALL STREET.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.687
ECONOMIC HUB OF AFRICAN

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.622
AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.859
BURNED TO THE GROUND. BECAUSE

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:10.292
THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.329
ECONOMICALLY. WE MUST CONTINUE

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.464
TO REMEMBER WHY WE HAVE THE

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.700
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BECAUSE SEEMS

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.769

OR BRING IT BACK IN EXTENDED OR

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.408

THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GONE BUT

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.852
IF WE LOOK AT HISTORY AND LOOK

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.255
AT WHAT'S BEING DONE IN OTHER

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:39.855
STATES WE KNOW THEY'RE TRYING

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:42.992
