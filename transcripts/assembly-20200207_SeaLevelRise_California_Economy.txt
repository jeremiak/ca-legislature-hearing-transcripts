WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF PLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT AFTER. WITH THEIR LEVY PLAN WHICH YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT. TODAY AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY ARE WHERE UNFORTUNATELY I ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIS COUNTY. OF SAN MATTEO IS PROJECTED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED IN THE STATE. WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN THE LEVEL RISE WE HAVE CHALLENGES BOTH ON OUR BASE SIDE OF COURSE AND- ON OUR COASTLINE WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT PLAY OUT. AS YOU AS WE DEAL WITH COASTAL EROSION. ALONG THE SAN MATEO COUNTY COAST AS THE SEA LEVELS RISE THE EAST SIDE OF HIGHWAY ONE A ONE. ALONG WITH SFO ARE AT RISK OF BEING INUNDATED BY FLOODING. THE PROPERTY LOSSES THE ECONOMIC LOSSES IN THE LOSS OF BASIC SERVICES SUCH AS POWER. SEWER SYSTEMS ARE REAL IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE. THAT WE MUST PLAN FOR. ACCORDING TO THE U. S. G. S. IN THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE ONE HUNDRED BILLION. WE SAY THAT AGAIN. ONE HUNDRED BILLION. OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION IN SHORELINE ECONOMIC ASSETS AT RISK FROM SEA LEVEL RISE IN CALIFORNIA. IS RIGHT HERE. IN THE BAY AREA SAN MATTEO COUNTIES RISK ALONE IS ESTIMATED AT TWENTY FOUR. BILLION SEA LEVEL RISE IS REAL AND IT IS HAPPENING NOW. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO ACT. WHILE WE STILL CAN THERE IS AN URGENCY HERE. I TOOK A REAL URGENCY THAT WE NEED TO ARTICULATE FOR THE BROADER PUBLIC. WITH THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING IN MY DISTRICT I LOOK FORWARD TO A VERY INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION. THAT WOULD SAY. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT STUFF YOU MIND SEVEN POOR TO ADVOCATING. FOR THE ASSEMBLY IS VERSION OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY BONDS. CURRENTLY BEING DRAFTED LANGUAGES BEING. UP CORD- AND CONSIDER. AND MY SINCERE HOPE IS THAT ANY BOND. THAT MAKES IT TO THE BALLOT ACKNOWLEDGES THE MAGNITUDE. OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. NOT ONLY IN THE BAY AREA BUT ROUTE. THE STATE WITH THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THE POOR TO A ROBUST DISCUSSION. THERE THAT WERE ON MEDICARE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE IN THE MOUNTAINS. CENTER HILLS DISTRICT ON A CONVERSATION THAT IS CAN BE A LITTLE BIT LEAK AS WE LOOK FOR FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGES THAT REALLY HAVE. BUT KNOWING WITH HIM TAIL COUNTY HAS AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM THEM KNOWING WHAT THE BAY AREA HAS DONE REALLY IN LEADING CALIFORNIA AND I WE THIS COUNTRY AND I'M VERY VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE OF LISTEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE. OVER THE DECADES DONE A LOT REALLY DID START LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OF RESOURCES. AND THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT RESOURCE BONDS IN SPECIALLY WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS TO THE PUBLIC AS A RESILIENCE. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL AND IF THE STATE IS WILLING TO SET STANDARDS HAVE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS LOOKING AT. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ROAD MAP LIKE THE LA REPORT. FIRST WHAT WE'RE FIRST GOING TO BE HEARING FROM. ON ANIL TODAY IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO ALSO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH THE PLANNING AND THE REGIONAL NEEDS THEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GETS DONE FROM THE STATE'S IMPORT I AM HOPING THAT WE ARE WILLING TO. SET STANDARDS THAT WE ARE WILLING TO ENCOURAGE LOCALS TO DO BROADER REGIONAL COOPERATION AROUND PLANNING EFFORTS AND REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT NEEDS TO GET AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE PUTTING RESOURCES ON THE TAPE. BONDS AND OTHER MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO MEET THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT THIS REPRESENTS NOT JUST FOR. TERMS AS GO BAY AREA BUT THE ENTIRE COAST OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE DAUNTING ISSUES AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT. HAVING US HARD TIME LOOKING HONESTLY AT THESE ISSUES BECAUSE OF THOSE IMPLICATIONS THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS. AND THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE COMING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WHAT THE REALITIES ARE SO THAT CREATES A VERY DIFFICULT LANDSCAPE I THINK TO OPERATE IN THAT'S WHY GOOD DATA GOOD INFORMATION WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE AMONG LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT ALSO WITH THE STATE TRULY AS A PARTNER IN HELPING TO SET THOSE STANDARDS I'VE BEEN WITH RESOURCES AND MAKE SURE ALL OF THESE. CAN BE ADDRESSED AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE NOT TOO THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT HERE IT'S NOT RECOGNIZED EVERYWHERE ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS COUNTRY UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME IT'S STILL FREE ELSE BUT LEAD PUT TOGETHER GOOD PLANS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSE OF EMPLOYMENT AND THEN WE CAN DO A LOT ON THIS ISSUE OF OUR TIME IT'S AND BUILDING TO RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY.

A ALONG COAST THERE'S PRETTY PRETTY GOOD SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS THE SINGLE IS WILL BE BE HALF OF IT AND BUT WITHIN NEXTAG A LITTLE BIT MORE UNCERTAINTY BY AND OF THE TREE BUT I AM. TO SEVEN FEET MOTHER RECENT KIND OF A DAY SUGGEST THAT COULD BE FROM MARS. IT'S NOT. THE THING SEAT BUT ALSO PACKS STORE AND TIED IT WILL BRING WATER AT. THE MORE EPISODE PLEASE. THEY'RE STILL STRUCTURES THAT THEY'RE GONNA BUT EVEN IF IT'S NOT A PROBLEM INK AND WE LEVEL. SO I HAVE IT TAX IN OUR IN FOR ACTION. SOURCE ONE OF UNITY PRIVATE. HE'S I THINK THESE ARE THAT IMPACT FROM ANALYSTS. THIS IS FROM MY ROOM AND I THINK IT'S BLOWN UP HERE IN A DURING HIM IS WELL. I'M ISN'T IS FOR USING A TOOL OR BY THE CDC OURS AGENCY HERE IN THE BAY. AT THAT TAX DIFFERENT FLOODING. THE TWO ZERO LAURA IN YOUR DORM IN THE STORE MIKE ANSWER READ NEARLY CAN SEE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER OF THE IMAGE IS BY UP PICTURE STIRS YOU WERE SITTING RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY I'M NOT THIS IS AB ANY I. ACTION ADVENTURE THIS IS FOR IS DOING. SO MOST OF THE WORK IS IN TO HAPPEN HELLO LEVEL BUT THAT DOES THE STATE ALSO HAVE A VESTED IN IN PRINT AND TAKE ACTION NOW EAT BUT FEEL THE IMPACTS OF AWAY AWAY A AND BRING. ED CANNOT MUST DO IS IN COST. TIME I'M A CO LAO S. TO TRY PRINCE. FOR DIFFERENT AREAS REALLY ONLY A LOT TO TAKE SOME AGES TO BE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD WORK. AND WE CAN TRY THINGS OUT DO YOU THINK WORK OR NOT AND THEN REPLICATE M. L. OR. KATE IS WE THE TIME OUR WE START NOW. SO WITH WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE STATE. CAPTION BY LOCAL GOT ENDS WITH A LOT OF WORK IS DONE BUT REALLY NEED AN OFFICE IS OF A SINGLE THE BILL THE STARTING TO MAYBE HI LEVEL ADEPT IN PLAN AND IS STARTING TO THINK. I'M PROUD. BUT REALLY VERY FEW SHORT CHECKS HAPPENING BUT BROWN ACROSS THE STATE. THE EARLY PHASE OF RATIONS NOW WE WILL CHARACTER I. SO WE KNOW. BUT JUST BEING ME KNOWS IT'S AREAS. FOR ANY AND PRIVATE X. SEC THREE IN THE PAST BUT I THINK WHICH RELATED FUNDING. BUT ALSO EXPERT IS AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW FIELD AND THEIR LIMITED EXPERT IS IN FIELD ON THE STATE AND OVER THE BRAND OF THE WORLD SO IT PARTY IN FOR LOCAL GOT THEM I'M A JET TO PARIS AT THE NEXT TO END PRETTY. CROSSED STATE. THIRD ALLEN IS INFORMATION IN THIS TESTING OR SEND US IT SHOULD BE HER INFORMATION OF YOU KNOW NOT FOR THE FIRST IN HIS TO BE OUR SEVERE TO BE ACTUALLY SOME GOOD TO PUT A BIT DEVELOPED. OR DO WE DO ABOUT THAT. SO NO ONE ON THE THESE ARE WHAT OF. SHOULD WE ON HOW MUCH DO THOSE. HOW DO WE WAY THE TRADE OFFS OF THOSE PROJECTS AND IT'S JUST AGAIN THIS LIMITED INFORMATION AROUND THE STATE AND NOT REALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXPRESSING NOT REALLY KNOWING WHO TO TURN TO FIND OUT SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS. THE FOURTH CHALLENGE. SUCH SOME THE COOK SENATE. IS REALLY ABOUT CUSTER'S TO ALL AND READ NO PLANNING. AND RESEARCH AND NOT REALLY HAVE FOR TO HELP THOSE. OF COME XIN. PART THREE BODY WITH THEIR EVERYDAY RESPONSIBILITIES AND SO BUT WE DOWN THE WALLS NINE FORM SPEAK THE WATER IS NOT STOP THE CITY COUNTY NINE. INSTEAD IN ONE SIX. WILL BACKED. UP IN THE NAY JURISDICTION. THREE CHALLENGE HEARD WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE MESSAGE THIS BUDGET. RT AT THE SENATE AND THEREFORE FOR OF THAT ELECTED OFFICIAL I AM THE WITH. HOUSING ISSUES AND HOMELESS ISSUES AND EDUCATION ISSUES AND THE KIND OF THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS AND THIS FEELS LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY FAR AWAY- BOTH FOR THE FOLKS RUNNING CITY GOVERNMENT AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND IN MANY CASES BUT ALSO FOR THE CITIZENS AND DON'T ARE THERE NOT KINDA CLAMORING FOR ACTION ON THIS YET ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE ACTIONS ARE GOING TO BE KIND OF. COULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS IT FEELS LIKE THIS ISN'T A HIGH PRIORITY YET FOR THEM. AND THEN THE FINAL CHALLENGE WE HEARD ABOUT IS. REGULATORY BARRIERS REALLY THAT IF. FOLKS ARE READY TO TRIED DOING SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING SYSTEM AGENCIES THEY HAVE TO GO TO AREN'T REALLY SET UP YET TO KIND OF KNOW HOW TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE. KINDS OF PROJECTS THERE USED TO EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF. BUILDING A NEW HOTEL ALONG THE COAST NOT BUILDING A LIVING SHORELINE PROJECT ALONG THE COAST AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS ABOUT- THE PROCESS IS IT'S JUST TAKING TOO LONG RIGHT NOW TO TRY AND GET SOME OF THESE PROJECTS DONE. SO WHAT DO WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ALL DO ABOUT THIS- WE HAVE- TWELVE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT SUMMER IS THE FACT. THIS ONE INJURED. I'M AND IN FOR. SOMEONE INDEED WHEN ALL OF THEM. ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE FIRST CATEGORY IS A REACHED SCALE ADAPTATION AND WE BREAK DOWN. SILOS AND HELP. LOCAL THERE TO I AM A SOME OF SHOES THAT ARE TO BE THE FACT THAT TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE HERE IN THE BAY ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO SPECIFICALLY WERE RECOMMENDING THAT THE STATE PROVIDE FUNDING. TO HELP HIRE SOME STAFF FOR REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE GROUPS TO SET UP A STRUCTURE TO DEVELOP PLANNING AND PLANS FOR IS SOME CROSS REGIONAL PLANS AND- THEN PROVIDE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ADDRESSED IN THOSE PLANS. I'M THE SECOND CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS EVEN IF WE SOME OF THIS GREAT REGIONAL WORK DOESN'T IN THE IN VITRO STUDIES ZINC NASAL. SO NEED TO UNDERTAKE JACKSON PLANNING I'M SORRY SO I THINK THIS NEEDS TO CONTINUE FOCUSING SUPPORTING THAT WELL. SO FAR FUNDING FOR OUR PLAN IN. TECH WE RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT SPEAK IF I'M- SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THE STATE IS PUTTING MONEY INTO SO THAT THE STATE IS REALLY YIELDING BENEFITS FROM IT- AND THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC DOLLARS OF THAT REALLY FOCUS ON WIDESPREAD PUBLIC BENEFITS- NATURAL RESOURCES AND THEN ALSO TESTING OUT SOME STRATEGIES THAT'S IN A PERFECTLY. APPROPRIATE USE OF STATE FUNDING WHAT CAN WE LEARN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE THAT ACROSS THE STATE. AND IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE MONITORING AND INFORMATION SHARING AS WELL. THE THIRD CATEGORY AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THE STATE PROVIDING FOR ME ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. TYPICALLY WERE WRECKED INNINGS NAPA AT THE BAD ATTITUDE SEND TEXT PLEASE BEAR WITH SOME. TOYS LOCATION AS SOME REGIONALS AFTER THIS IS RIGHT RESPOND TO WHAT WE'VE OVER NO CAN I NEED SOMEBODY TO CALL A WEBSITE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. NEEDS TO CALL ALL UP TALK THROUGH THE ISSUES WITH ME CONNECT YOU WITH THE L. WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS TWO WAY AND LEARN FROM THEM I THINK THAT- IMPORT ROLE THE STATE AS WELL AS DEVELOPING INTO AND HELPING- ADDRESS OF THESE THE TOP EIGHT. ROADBLOCKS AND THEN THE FINAL CATEGORY. IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THIS PUBLIC AWARENESS ISSUE SO WE RECOMMEND PUTTING IT SEC I'M- IT WILL CAMPAIGN TO CREASE LOOK AWAY S. ENSURE THERE'S BROUGHT OUT SH FOR STATE FUNDED PROGRAM IS- THEN WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE STATE ADOPT. REQUIRE FOR REAL THE DISCLOSURES ARE ON FLOODING FOR SEA LEVEL RISE COMPARABLE TO WHAT WE HAVE FOR EARTHQUAKES OR- FIRES OR OTHER KINDS OF FLOODING THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE THAN THERE IS ABOUT EARTHQUAKES SO WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE PUBLIC POLICY THAT THAT BE INCLUDED IN INFORMATION THAT OUR IS PROVIDED AS PART OF. THAT TRANSACTIONS. SO IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE RIGHT TODAY IS ONE OF THOSE NEXT STEPS- IN TRYING TO INCREASE. AWARENESS OVERSIGHT INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS YOU HAVE. THE CIVIC PLEDGE OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE RIGHT DISPOSABLE BUT AT TEN SHARP CLIMATE AND TO THE OLDER. ACTION THEY DEPART DO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY BUT OF COURSE AT YOUR FINGER TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES EVEN FEEL A LOT OF THE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE LOCAL WILL YOU TOOL AS WELL. AND HOW ARE. IN FINE WE CLOSE FOR AN EMAIL POSTED WHICH IS STATE IF WE DO ALL OF THE BUT WE ARE HERE WE WENT DONE. I'M HEARD BUT THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH. OF ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO LIMIT THE HER IN THAT ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WORK DID IN. HERE I'M. OR SEEN IN BEARS. ISN'T IT EARNS MARKETS HAPPEN AN INCH IS OF. IT IS OUT OF IT THAT STILL HOME RISEN BUSINESS OWNERS THEY ARE. A LOT OF GOING INTO WHEN THE TIDE BEING AND LINE OF PUBLIC TRUST AND **** TO MOVE AND DID IT IN NEWS. I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF. THINGS OUT THERE THAT WILL BEFORE HE WAS THE LEGISLATURE. THINKING WHERE AND HOW WE BILL YEAH THESE ARE LOT OF THAT AGAIN ARE WE'VE WE'VE THIS AS A FIRST STEP TRYING TO SUPPORT LOCAL PLANNING BUT THE ISSUES ARE ARE BEING AND LOOMING AS WELL. SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALL OUR WORK IS ALWAYS ON OUR WEBSITE AND I'M- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US TODAY. ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU RACHEL FOR THE PRESENTATION AND FOR SETTING THAT SETTING THE TABLE FOR US. THE GOVERNOR HAS TALKED ABOUT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND IN THE BUDGET. OF THE SENATE AS WELL AS BEING. TOO SHORT OF A FIVE BILLION THE ASSEMBLY IS COMPILING IS PROPOSAL FOR BOND FINANCING TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND SOMETHING THAT CONTEMPLATES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. YOUR THE FISCAL PURSE I WANTED TO JUST ASK YOU IF THERE IS A BUDGET REASON WHY WE OUT OF OURSELVES TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR. BOND ON THE MARCH BALLOT FOR EDUCATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AT THE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LEVEL FOR SOMETHING THAT IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTY TO A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR- CHALLENGE. IS THERE A IS THERE BUDGET REASON WHY WE OUGHT TO LIMIT OURSELVES- AT THIS TIME. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS- STATUS OF OUR BONDED INDEBTEDNESS NOW IN CALIFORNIA AND- SORT OF WHERE WE ARE HISTORICALLY WITH REGARD TO BONDED INDEBTEDNESS AND IS THERE A CONCERN ABOUT THE BROADER ECONOMY WHERE A GROWTH PERIOD THE RECESSION IS NOT UPON US YET BUT JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERING ONE WERE ACTUALLY CRAFTING A PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT GO BEFORE THE VOTERS. SURE YEAH. THERE'S NO RIGHT NUMBER FOR A BOND- AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN AS YOUR FISCAL VISORS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS BUT I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TRADE OFF SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WE WOULD SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT OR WHAT DO YOU ASSESSES THE NEED. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE BENEFIT OF BONDS AS IT PROVIDES AN INFLUX OF FUNDING OF IMMEDIATELY FOR NEAR TERM. CAPITAL PROJECTS- TO TRADE OFF WITH BOND IS THAT THEN YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT FOR QUITE AWHILE YOU KNOW FOR USUALLY THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS. AND I'M AND YOU'RE PAYING MORE BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING INTEREST. AND THOSE OUT YOUR COSTS ARE NON NEGOTIABLE THEIR COMMITMENTS ITS FIRST CALL AND THE GENERAL FUND EVERY YEAR- SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND ON DEBT FOR PREVIOUS. ONES ABOUT ONE IN LITTLE OR ONE MILLION AND FOR NOW RESOURCE RELATED BONDS HISTORICALLY THAT'S A PRETTY LOW PERCENTAGE OF GENERAL FUND IT'S ABOUT 4% OF OUR ANNUAL GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES RIGHT NOW FOR BOND AT. THAT'S FOR. REASONS ONE IS WE HAVE A VERY HEALTHY GENERAL RIGHT NOW HIS STORE. SO FOR AS LOW BECAUSE OUR IS ONE OF THOSE REASONS. SO I THINK WE WOULD ADVISE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BONDS IS NOT FREE MANY- IT DOES HAVE KIND OF. GENERATIONAL IMPACTS IN TERMS OF PAYING IT OFF AS WELL AS- THE BENEFITS- SO YOU COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT A COMBINATION OF SOME BONDS- AMOUNT TO. THAT YOU FOR ON WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY THAT DEBT BUT ALSO WE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A HEALTHY GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW YOU COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT SOME PAY AS YOU GO. AND SOME. UP FRONT GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT. I'M DEBT AND PERHAPS THE STATE IS BETTER POSITION TO ALL FOR NOW. IT DOESN'T COMMIT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE AS ABLE TO AFFORD AN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. FRUIT AND FOR THE WORK OF THE LA WAS OFTEN THE REPORT OF A YOUR LYING IN THE SONG WHICH IS THAT AND WITH THE SIX IS IN THE TWELVE DAYS SOME. KIND OF PHONE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT I MEAN THEY'RE SO MANY FOR. I GUESS THE QUESTION COMES TO MY FOR ME IS WHERE DO WE BE. WHAT WOULD BE. THE FIRST SECOND THIRD THING TO ME A NUMBER OF THE STATE AND PROBABLY THE MOST OBVIOUS TO ME IS THE ONE THAT- MACHINE. IS NOT A PRIORITY THOUGH IT'S THE EDUCATION AND KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY WITH THE TIRES LEADERSHIP- BUT- WHERE WOULD IS THERE A BENEFIT IN ORDER THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW. YEAH I THINK WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT PLANNING. YOU KNOW MANY FOR PLANNING NEEDS TO COME BEFORE PROJECTS AND- SO SOME OF THAT PLANNING AND THEN SETTING UP SOME OF THESE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IS ALSO KIND OF A FIRST LINE- ACTIVITY. COMMAND PROVIDING SOME SOME PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR. FIRST OF STAFF IN CREATING REGIONAL CLUB AROUND THE STATE- TO START THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE POINTS WE TRY TO MAKE IS WE NEED TO START DOING SOME PROJECTS AND SOME PILOT PROJECTS IN PARTICULAR TO LEARN BUT- WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO INFUSE SO MUCH FUNDING IMMEDIATELY. IT'S KIND OF GOOD PROJECTS ARE READY TO GO AND THE PLANNING IS AN IN PLACE BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO BE STRATEGIC AND HAVE A COORDINATED APPROACH AND WE CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS WE HAVE THE I. RELATIONSHIP PARTNERSHIP SET UP TO BEGAN- THINKING ABOUT THINGS ON A REGIONAL BASIS. MICHAEL ACTUALLY ABOUT EXACTLY THAT WOULD TAX AND FROM WHAT YOU TEENS THE ONE OVER THERE ARE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND THAT ALREADY WITH CERTAIN PILOT PROJECTS THAT COULD BE FUNDED- YEAH WE WERE. FORTUNATE TO BE IN GOOD BUDGETARY TIMES AND WE'RE ALL ABOUT ONE TIME SPENDING WE DON'T WANT TO LOCK IN TOO MUCH SPENDING IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE GOOD TIMES ALAS RIGHT. ARE THERE PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT YOU SEEN THE THAT ARE CLOSE TO SHOVEL READY- THAT THE STATE COULD AND THE TO START TESTING TO SEE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS I THINK I THINK THERE ARE- AND IN FACT THERE WAS ONE IN IN ENCINITAS IN THE CHAIRS DISTRICT BUT THAT IS KIND OF ONE OF THE ONES THAT'S HELD UP. OF A LIVING SHORELINE PROJECT THAT. THEN I'M SURE. SHARE COULD SPEAK TO BETTER ME BUT- YES AND I THINK THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS OUR AGENCY THAT HAS. TYPICALLY BEEN A CONDUIT BY WHICH WE HAVE FUNDED PROJECTS THROUGH THE STATE AND THEY'VE KIND OF GOT THEIR FINGER ON THE PULSE. THEY MAY NEED TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON PLANNING JUST TO DO THAT. HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANS AND PERMITTING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THOSE PROJECTS- WHICH- HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF STATE FUNDING FOR WE'VE- BEEN PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THINGS LIKE FROM ABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND CONNECT AT FIRST BUT THERE IS A- THERE IS A GAP. ON THAT- NEXT SEVERAL. FOR LANDING SPECIFIC PROJECTS BEFORE YOU ARE READY TO DO THE ACTUAL ALL I'M GRANTING FOR IT BUT BUT YES I THINK IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WE ARE STARTING AND THERE WERE PROBABLY BE MORE IF FOLKS KNOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE MONEY AVAILABLE FOR IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE VERY INFORMATIVE PANEL- WE ARE RUNNING SLIGHTLY BEHIND SO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE IT TIRED OF A MINUTES ALLOTTED TO YOU.

THIS IS CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR FOSTER CITY TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. FROM DAMAGE TO THEM AND THEIR PROPERTIES FROM POSSIBLE FLOODING DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE. BUDGET IS FUNDED THROUGH A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR BOND MEASURE PAID FOR BY FOSTER CITY PROPERTY OWNERS BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. ARE PUNISHED US WITH OVER ONE APPROVED BECAUSE WE UNDER ANY.

WE MAY MAKE ANOTHER SUGGESTION IN ST MEANING THE PERMITTING PROCESS THE TICKET CONSIDER ATION WITH NO MENTION FOR YOU. NOW I'M GONNA PASS IT UP TO ARES MANAGE MENT TO DESCRIBE THE PROJECT MORE DETAIL AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE. THANK YOU. I'LL BE PROVIDING A HISTORY OF THE PROJECT DESIGN OVERVIEW AND THEN A TIME LINE OF NEXT STEPS. TO THE AREA IN RED IN THE SLIDE TO THE RIGHT IN AND OUT ACTUALLY TO THE LEFT AS WELL SHOW THE ALIGNMENT OF OUR CURRENT LEVY IT'S ABOUT AN EIGHT MILE STRETCH. FRONT ALONG THE WALL CURRENT. SOUTH OF THIS DO WE HAVE SALUTE. TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND DURING THIS PROJECT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IS WHEN I STARTED AS THE PUBLIC CORRECT. FIRST MY INBOX WAS A FROM. THE FEET LETTERS AS THE RAISE YOUR LEVY. ENOUGH SO ON THE ENTIRE THE STORY. IS NEVER BEEN A ZONE. ABOUT STRESS- BELOW THAT IMMEDIATELY HE ALSO CITED WRETCH TO. LEARN TO ASSIST A- PIECE OF THIS NINE. WE STARTED WORKING BASIS IT IS UP TO WORK WITH CONSULT HIM AS WELL BALLOT THE STAFF. YOU CAN CHECK THE- TODD NOW THIS WAS CORRECT AND AS A RESULT WE DO THE COUNCIL NOT TO CHALLENGE THE MATH TIME IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE ASKED FOR HIM OF COURSE THE COLLUSION MAPPING DESIGNATION AND WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS STAY OUT OF THE FLOOD ZONE ALL PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD STAY OUT OF THE FLOOD ZONE PROVIDED THAT WE SHOW PROGRESS WITH THE PROJECT AT ANY TIME FEE LOOK AT A PLACE TO SIT IN THE FLOOD ZONE. IN TWENTY SWEEP WE STARTED PROGRESSING WITH DESIGN AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT CERTIFIED. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO AS WE GOT FURTHER ALONG WITH DESIGN AND WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A- REASONABLE COST ESTIMATE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAD A BALLOT MEASURE AND IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED WITH AN 81% APPROVAL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WILL WE BE WE CONTINUED WITH DESIGN. AND WE INITIATED THE PERMIT PROCESS TOWARDS THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BEGINNING OF TWENTY NINETEEN. ON JANUARY SEVENTH. OF THIS YEAR WE RECEIVED A LITTLE BIT OF A LATE CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND WE GOT OUR FINAL PERMIT. SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. WE ANTICIPATE A BEGINNING CONSTRUCTION RIGHT AROUND TWENTY TWENTY WITH ENDING CONSTRUCTION IS A THREE YEAR CONSTRUCTION PERIOD DEALING WITH- TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS. AND DEALING WITH WHEN YOU CAN CONDUCT CONSTRUCTION SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. AND SO BEGINNING IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THIS LIGHT HERE SHOWS WHAT. WHAT I DESIGN IS HOW HOW WE NEED TO GO IF YOU SEE THE A SCALE I'M CONCERT WAS ONE TWO AND FOUR AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT FIRST. ONE IS GROUP. TO THE EGGS TING OUT PATIENTS THIRTEEN. AND THE HEIGHT WE RAISE THE LEVEL WAS. OFF SEE TRACK THOSE TO IN THE ELEVATE OUR LEAD TO A- AREA YOU GO TO SHOULDN'T FIVE IT IS OUR WAY ACTION THERE. WE ARE REYES. TO NAP BEAT. THE TO SUBSTANCE IN THE LISTING A PATIENT TWELVE THIRTY AND WE RAISE IT THIRTY AND I HE- IS AT TO HAVE LESS DAY THAT. BUDGET I AM SEVERAL OF IT IS BASED. YOUR CITY THE UNLESS IT'S THE ONE THAT VERY TOP LEFT AND THAT IS YOU'LL SEE AN FOUND IS THE EXIST THREE AND THIS IS A SECTION. YOU HAVE TO RUN THE LETTER B. AS AS BILL THIS. DOWN HI. TO EXIST STE. SO HELLO. AND WE HI SHE ALL WHICH OPPOSES TO WHICH PILOT SOUNDS RAISE THE TOWARDS LAND BIRDS. AND TEAR DOWN TO EXISTING GOVERNMENT AND THEN PENSION PLAN UNDER NEW THE NINE BREAK THE NET SO WHERE WE HAVE TOLD THE WALLS WE TO TIE INTO THIS STRUCK. IT IS AREAS WE CONVERT FLOOD BALLS SO TOTAL YOU HAVE TWENTY TO THE THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH. BUT FIVE THOUSAND FOUR. LEVY FOR A FEE OF FLOOD WILL. SO THE NEXT HERE JUST DOES SHE DO UP I'M- BIG DOWN UP SO OUR OUR LEVEE IMPROVEMENT ALSO EIGHT WITH IS. SET TO TIE BAY AREA IT RB TRAIL SYSTEM. THE DISTINGUISHED TRIP WELL AS OUT TEN FEET TO TWENTY TWELVE FEEL NOW. AND WITH THE TEMPO IT ACTUALLY OF THE CITY WIDE. SO YOU'LL SEE THE STATE OF UP WHICH TWELVE. ENSURE THEN THE PATRIOT SO USE THIS PILE WALL WE THE RIGHT IS THE LET. THURSDAY BUT THIS LOW THE WILL BE TEAM WHY WOULD PROVIDE THIS RATIO INCREASE SAFETY. BEATS CREATION BETWEEN BY IN PUT. SO THIS IS JUST A CROSS SECTION WHERE WE HAVE TO MEET EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT ARKANSAS DISABILITIES ACT REQUIREMENTS THIS IS ON A BEACH PARTY PART AB LANES MORRELL AVENUE SO STREET- WE HAVE TO HOLD THE A TEST IMPROVEMENTS AT THOSE ARE PART OF OUR DESIGN. FAR AS FINANCING GOES. AS A BALLOT MEASURE IT'S ESTIMATED NINE BILLION DOLLARS. IS FINANCING AS A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE CITY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND AS I MENTION ONE MORE MINUTE THINKING ONE MORE MINUTE THIS IS THE LAST FLIGHT. PERFECT SO- CURRENTLY WE WORE THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CON WHICH HOUSES TO OCCUR THE BILL THE REVIEW WAS DONE WEEKS GO UP MY SPINE. WELL THAT'S LEAVE WE'RE GONNA DO EVERY FOR QUALIFICATION MAKE SURE WE GET OF CALL CON HERE'S- QUALIFY. THE TIME IN ORDER THEM TO BID ON PROJECT WE INTO TO HELP PULL CONSIDER THE APPROVAL OF DESIGN YEAH THAT. IS THE JET BLOWING THAT AN EXTRACTION AN ALLY OF TWENTY TWO. SECOND MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WILL SAVE THE QUESTIONS FOR THE END BUT IF WE CAN ASK THE NEXT THREE SPEAKERS TO COME UP. VICE MAYOR SHELLEY MASER. I AM GARLAND PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FOR THE SILLY CITY.

RIGHT OUR GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH ESTEEMED PANEL I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TO REPRESENT THE CITY OF REDWOOD CITY AND RECOGNIZE THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SEA LEVEL RISE ALL AROUND THE WORLD REALLY BUT HERE IN THE BAY AREA AS SUPERVISOR PINE- TALKED ABOUT. SO REDWOOD CITY IS THE THIRD LARGEST A WITH THAT'S THAT'S MY JOB TO DO NOW HERE WE GO. CITY THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IT HAS NINETEEN SQUARE MILES OF LAND AND SIXTEEN SQUARE MILES. OUT TO THE NEXT WINDOWS CAN SING SQUARE MILES OF WATER IT HAS A DEEP WATER PORT INDUSTRY HOUSING AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG THE BAY AS A QUICK NOTE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OUR PORT SIDE ONE POINT THREE SIX MILLION TONS OF CARGO WITH FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND CONTRIBUTED SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO OUR CITIES GENERAL FUND SO UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND OTHER IMPACTS A SEA LEVEL RISE OUR CITY HAS FORMED AN AD HOC COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE AT THAT HOW COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL WAS A CLIP TEND TO COLLABORATE WITH THE REGIONAL. ARTS AND THEIR NEWLY FORMED I'M REGIONAL COMMITTEE. SO AS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS THE COMMITTEE TOOK A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE FOR CITY. YOU CAN SEE BY THESE MAPS THE DATE AND TIME. A NORTH AND BETTER. I WILL CAN'T REALLY STREET BUT- TAKE MY WORD DOES IN GREECE. I AM SORRY BUT HAVE BACK JENNIFER BY FOR ON THE TWENTY TEAM INSURANCE RATE HAS BEEN OF SOME. THE WHAT AS A- WITHOUT ASIAN FIRST THE ERROR OF THE SAID WATER SYDNEY ONLY IN CASE AND THE BILL TO RISE SELAH FOUR THREE BUSINESS COPY AND ROADS THE SHOW. WELL AND WHAT HAVE A WE BEEN EXPECTED A GOOD FOR OF OUR SIT AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES WILL BE AFFECTED. THERE'S JUST DEAD A SNAPSHOT OF ACTOR SO. THEY ARE VERY BY USE REFLECT DIVERSE REDWOOD CITY AMOUNT. IN THIS IS ALMOST HALF THIS IS CITY LET. IF OUT. AND THE BRIDGES FOR THOSE WITH CITY OF TEENS WERE FILE THIS IS INCLUDE ANY OF THE POP RIGHT OF WAY IS A REAL WHAT'S THE GOAL ONE A ONE FOR AB WHICH MAY IT AREA MUCH LARGER THAN CALCULATED. OUR REDWOOD CITY GENERAL PLAN DOT IS WRECKED AS A POTENTIAL FOR LEVEL RISE IMPACT. BUT WE KNOW THE IT CANNOT I'LL BUY ONE CITY AND THE ZIP I MAKE PACKED OTHER SO WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF TACKLING THIS FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PARTNERING CLOSELY WITH THE ALL OF THE REGIONAL EFFORTS. BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEW AGENCY THAT WAS IDENTIFIED ASSIGNING STAFF TO CLIMATE READY SAN MATEO COUNTY AND WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AS WE'VE DONE OUR VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS- WORKED ON ADAPTATION GUIDANCE AND MAPPING SEA LEVEL RISE. SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE EFFORTS WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN REDWOOD CITY AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND THINK ABOUT THE IMPACTS. SO HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE IS ACTUALLY- I LIVE. KIND AND SHARE IT THIS A NEW APARTMENT PLAQUES WERE WORKS IN THE FIFTH IN AT A STARTING OUT PATIENT TEN EIGHT AND WAS REQUIRED TO RID OF IT I'D AN ADDITIONAL FIVE FEET TO THE LOWEST FOR. WHAT DID FIFTY FEET THIS WAS DONE TO MOVE HI DIED OUT OF THE FLOOD PLAIN AND ACCOMMODATE SEA LEVEL RISE AND WAS RAISED TO THE LEVEL OF TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PROJECTIONS IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH OUR GENERAL PLAN WHICH REQUIRES NEW DEVELOPMENT TO BE DESIGNED TO PROTECT FROM POTENTIAL FLOODING. RESULTING FROM SIGNIFICANT FLOOD EVENTS AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES TO CONSIDER POSSIBLE SEA LEVEL RISE. ANOTHER ACTION ROADS IS TAKING LIKE EXERCISE IT IS ADDRESSING OUR RV. TAX THIS IS A BET THIS MAP OF SEA PORTS ARE SURE TO SEE SENATOR MADE JUST A REFLECTS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO. CREDIT GEN THIS DIDN'T LEVEES INTO BATTLE MR. AREA TO UP AS WELL FOR THE IN THE OUR OF CASH A NEW BELARUS DISTRICT WILL BE FORMED TO OBTAIN FUNDING AND REIMBURSE THE DEVELOPERS FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAVE COMPLETED DESIGN AND ARE OBTAINING PERMIT SO SHOVEL READY PROJECT. AND WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN THIS YEAR WAS A PRELIMINARY COST OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROJECT IN TERMS OF COST AND REFLECTS THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS WILL NEED TO BE MAKING ACROSS THE REGION. SO AS SUCH WE CONCUR WITH REQUESTS THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR LATER FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY INSTITUTE THAT THE STATE CONSIDER MATCHING FINDING- TO MEASURE A A. B. RESTORATION FENCES SUPERVISOR PINE DESCRIBED. PROVIDE FUNDING SUPPORT LOCAL CAPACITY BUILDING ADAPTATION IN PLANNING AS WELL AS OFFERING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND IN GENERAL WE SUPPORT THE INACTION OF THE LA- RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU. JOB FOR RAIN TWO MINUTES UNDER THE ACT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING SFO TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT OUR SHORELINE PROTECTION PROGRAM. MY NAME IS JOE BEER AND THE DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AT SFO. WHERE'S MY. THE SOMEBODY ELSE'S FIVE THREE. THERE WE GO. WE. BUT OKAY WELL I SUPPOSE AN IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE REGION IN THE NATION IT'S ALSO AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THE REGION IN THE SEVENTH IS USED FOR CARE. THE NATION BY PASSED. WE SHOULD. FIFTY MILLION PASSENGERS. FIRST OF APRIL FOR IN DAHLE DIRECT CAN I BENEFITS LOCALLY AND FIFTY EIGHT. I SIXTY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE REGION I SUPPOSE ALSO THE LARGEST. EMPLOYER IN SAN MATEO COUNTY OKAY THIS IS LIKE THREE SO I SUPPOSE CURRENTLY AT RISK OF FLOODING TODAY OF THE IMAGE ON THE LEFT IS OUR- TELL. HIM IS. APPS MANY CAN FOR YOUR OF AND ON THE RIGHT IS THE THAT YOU LOW RISE PRESS A FOR OUR IS PIECE IS IMAGE ON SHOW. NOT ONLY THE PHONE FOR WHAT. ARE NAY. AND CAL RAINBOW. IT IS ALL ONE TO US ALL RIGHT SO CLEARLY IN HIS DECISION THIS REQUIRES. OKAY SEE THIS RISK AS OPPOSED DEVELOPED OUR SHOWROOM PROTECT PROGRAM THE OBJECTIVE OF PROTECT AGENCIES PRICE IN THE HUNDRED FLOOD. GETTING US ALL THE FOR THE FAME OF INSURANCE RATE MAPS AND SURE WE HAVE A- CHANCE. TAKEN IN A GROUP. INTO A RETAIL SO. ALL THIS IS BEING DONE. TO AT THE ABILITY OF THE AIRPORT. WE ALSO NEED TO CONSTRUCT A SURE ONE PROTECT SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT MAX SAFE OP. OF AIRCRAFT ON THE GROUNDS TRAVERSING THE AIRFIELD AND SAFE OPERATIONS OF AIRCRAFT LANDING AND TAKING OFF AT SFO. MESSED UP OKAY THERE WE GO. YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THIS OKAY I LOST I'M JUST GONNA FROM HERE. THE FAA SAID STUDENTS SINCE THE SAFETY PARAMETERS FOR CLEARANCES REQUIRED. TO RUN INTO WAYS. DOUBLE SHE IS. LANDING OF LICENSE AND JUST GAVE OUT PATIENTS GIVE BUT EXTREMELY INSTRUCT AIRPORT. ENGINE THE REQUIREMENTS ALLOW MUCH ROOM FIRST ON PROTECT THIS IS. IN ORDER TO DROP SAFELY AND- IN THE OPERATIONAL FISHER OF THE AIR FOR. ONLY NAY EACH OF TELL THERE ARE REBEL OF THE BAY. NEVER RIVER AND THERE REMAIN ON THE BAY AS INDICATE BY THE CO CHECKING IN THE DIE. WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. YEAH OUR SHORT TERM PROGRAM WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL THEY FEEL AT THE END OF THE RUNWAYS BUT IS NOT SHOWN HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF IT AT THE TIME. THE AIRPORT IS SUPPORT SUPPORT OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. WE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT IN THE VICINITY OF THE AIRPORT. BECAUSE OF ITS FUNCTION AS A WILDLIFE ATTRACTANT ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO BIRDS WHICH CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT SEE FOR COP CRAFT OPERATIONS. SO BECAUSE OF THAT SO FOUR WILL PROPOSE A HARD ARMORED SEA WALL SOLUTION. OKAY FINALLY OKAY WE THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE MINDS ON BATES GILL WHEN THE- BUDGET. EXISTING ASSETS FIRST YOUR BASE. ENGINE LEVEL DISCUSSIONS ARE ON THE BED TO SIT IN MAY FORMS MICHAEL. IN THE NOTE PRESS FOR NATURE BASIL. TO PROTECT THE LOW PRICE WE THINK THE ROOM. WE ALL MUST ACKNOWLEDGE. BOB ONE THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BLUE PARDON BRING TEN GRAY AND FIRST NEED TO BE CONSIDERED EQUALLY AS AND VIABLE OPTIONS. AS WE GET CLOSER TO SUBMITTING OUR DOT SECRET DOCUMENTATION ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN THE MINDS OF AT ALL BAY FILL YOUR NEGATIVELY. MANY SEA LEVEL RISE PROJECTS WILL REQUIRE BAY FILL PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE BAY FILL SHOULDN'T TO PROTECT AGAINST SEA LEVEL RISE SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED IN THE SAME LIGHT AS BAY FILL PROJECTS. FOR PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS. MEDICATIONS ANOTHER ASPECT OF ANY PROJECT THAT IS CONCERNING A DIFFICULT FOR PER MATISSE CURRENTLY MITIGATION IS REQUIRED TO BE ON SITE OR AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE PROJECTED SITE IS TO BE UNDERTAKEN INDIVIDUALLY BY EACH PERMIT T. THIS IS A SPECIALLY PRICED PROBLEMATIC IN THE CENTRAL BAY WHERE THERE ARE LESS MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES. THE MITIGATION PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER AND IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO CLOSE OUT PERMITS. WHAT SFO IS ADVOCATING FOR OUR MITIGATION BANKS OR IN LIEU FEE PROGRAMS SET UP FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES. THESE BANKS ARE PROGRAMS COULD HELP MITIGATE MITIGATION MOVE FOR ANYWHERE IN THE BAY ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AS SHOWN BY THE COLOR DIAGRAMS THE NORTH BAY IN THE SOUTH BAY HAVE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR WETLAND RESTORATION. REGIONAL APPLICATION BANKS AND IN LIEU FREE PROGRAMS COULD GIVE PUBLIC AGENCIES OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING THEIR PROJECTS TO GET AGGREGATE REGIONAL MITIGATION EFFORTS OR ACT AS A STEADY FUND OF SOURCES FOR MITIGATION PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE BAY. WE THINK THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS MORE AND MORE AGENCIES IMPLEMENT SEA LEVEL RISE PROTECTION IN THE FUTURE. SEVERAL BELIEVES CHANGES IN BODY FEEL POLICY AND PRACTICES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL MITIGATION OPTIONS NEEDS TO START NOW. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR ENGAGEMENT ON THESE REGIONAL ISSUES AND WHAT AND WITH THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES TRYING TO IMPLEMENT STE WILL RISE PROTECTION PROJECTS AROUND THE BAY. THANK YOU AND SORRY FOR ALL THOSE STAFFERS HEALTH PROBLEM HE MADE A VERY EXCITING WE HAD TO PAY ATTENTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAVE. TO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ASSEMBLY MANNER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATOR- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WERE HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR SURVIVAL- OF THIS CITY OF ALAMEDA AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT- ALAMEDA IS THE MOST POPULOUS- ISLAND CITY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND WE'RE PRETTY PROUD OF A LOT OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO DATE- ON THE SCREEN YOU CAN SEE WE'VE RECENTLY ADOPTED A CLIMB. IN AND RIP BILLIONS I AM I'VE START ACTING. BECAUSE THE AND IT COMPLETE AND WE'RE- LIMIT YOU KNOW WHAT. OF THE SHIP WILL BE BAD AND FOR HELP SO MISSING US LOOKS ALLIED THERE WE GO OKAY I'M DOING THE SAME THING IS TO OUR- THANK YOU. OWE IT IS IN. TO ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE. WITHOUT FIRST TALKING ABOUT REDUCING EMISSIONS THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING- THAT WOULD BENEFIT ALAMEDA AND OUR GLOBE IS IF WE REDUCE EMISSIONS BECAUSE BY REDUCING THOSE A MISSION OUR PROBLEM BUT SEE YOU ARRIVE OUR LESSON. I IN THE- FOLLOWING CALLED A CLASS SAFE PATH. THIS IS JUST GOING OTHER PEOPLE WHAT TO DO BUT IN OUR CITY. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY TWENTY PERCENT. OVER LAST FIFTEEN HE IS- WE ALSO HAVE J. THREE FOR TWENTY TWENTY THIS YEAR ALL RESIDENTS. ARE YOU USING ALL YOUR BAND CLEAN ELECTRICITY ELSE AGAIN AS IN YOUR FIRST TWENTY TWENTY A HUNDRED AND CLEAN ACTRESS SO WE ARE TAKING SIGNIFICAN I AM. TIM SHORE THE SEA LEVEL RISE IS OUT ON THE JUNCTION- ON THE FIRST THE- THE SPECTRUM BUT A LOT LESS THAN THAT WE'RE ALSO WILLING TO TOUCH SOME THIRD RAIL ISSUES ARE CLIMATE ACTION RESILIENCY PLAN EXPLORES. CONGESTION PRICING SO THINK ABOUT AN ISLAND WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE OR SIX WAYS TO GET ON AND OFF THE ISLAND AND WE'RE WILLING TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER CONGESTION PRICING IS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF AUTOMOBILES AND INTO ALTERNATIVE. MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WHAT THIS PLAN DID- WAS IDENTIFIED KEY FLOODING LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR CITY AND SO IF YOU TAKE THIS MATTER THAT SHE DOESN'T DOESN'T MOST HELLO THIS MAP RIGHT SO LITTLE A LITTLE TIGHT- AWARE OF OUR IT IS DOESN'T SCARE MOST PEOPLE HOWEVER. OF THIS MAP REPRESENTS- THREE IS A LOVER. GET TECHNICALITY WORSE NOR THIS. OF AT. GIVES WE SEE HOW SINCE IF. THE FLY AND I WANT TO ADD OF THE TO PAY. OF CLYDE THESE. HERE IS OF THE BASE TO CONNECT OUT OKAY THE LEAST TO TAP ABOUT FEET OUT AND VEHICLE GO THROUGH THEM EVERY DAY. I'LL BE WE HAD A LOT MEAL PLANS AND THAT SHE DONE ARE TUBES AND OUR GOAL IS TO BEAT AIM UP RELY TOOK ME OUT HOW TO AT TO PLACE TO USE IT ME ABOUT OR MINUTES SO IN FUTURE AT FEET OF C. LOVER WITH COMMON IN AND HERE WE DON'T. REYES I THERE ARE TWO. IN THAT INSTANCE NOW HERE'S- MORE THAN THAT IS THAT NOT JUST A FEW THE REST IS A CURRENT DAY YOU'RE I MEAN IF. FORM IS GET HAVE THE SAME RIGHT OLD. IF THAT ON A FIFTY TERMS TOM WILL HAVE BOTH A OUR TO OF FLOOD. THAT'S THE SAY THAT THIS IS NOT JEFF AND PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE BUT IS H. TO FOR MY TO DEAL WITH LEVEL RISE IN A FEW WE STATE WE DEAL WITH THOSE CAR FUNDING- RISKS AB TODAY- IN ADDITION WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE CLIMATE PLAN IS THERE'S ANOTHER RISK OUT THERE THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT BEFORE- THIS PROCESS AND THAT IS THE RISE OF GROUND WATER YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A BIT. MORE ABOUT THIS LATER I BELIEVE- BUT ESSENTIALLY OF SOME OF THE PREDICTIONS ARE ACCURATE AROUND GROUND WATER IT'S ALSO A MERGING IN THIS SAME AREA OF BLUE- IN FUTURE YEARS SAID THAT- THAT IS GOING TO DEFINITELY BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR US SO NOW WE'RE GONNA ZOOM BACK OUT- LOOK AT OUR ISLAND THIS TIME GOING TO FOCUS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SO IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. THAT BUT IN ADDITION YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND IS AN AIR OF OURS THE CALL BACK ARM IT JEEZ. OF THE- ARE A LITTLE. OR OUT IT THE NEXT WHY'D YOU SEE. MAY A POINT OF IN AND DAY FOR ALL OF THAT BILL. IS A IN THE CITY OF A AS A WRITER THAT BIRTH BE ON THIS AND GET BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT. THAT IT'S IN ANOTHER CITY IT'S SO CALTRAIN RIGHT AWAY SO YOU HELP. TRANSPORTATION ALL IN MAINE MEANS THAT- THE ROAD IT'S IN ANOTHER CITY YET ARE. AFFECTING OF. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR LITTLE CITY- DE UM SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PROJECT THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION POTENTIALLY A REGIONAL STRUCTURE COULD HELP OUT. IN TERMS OF THE PRIOR TATIAN A PRIVATIZATION OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS NOW I DON'T WANT TO OVERSELL THIS SO- FIXING THIS LOCATION TERMS OF RAISING. A ROAD THAT DOES NEED TO BE DONE IT DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THE I'M TO WORKING BY THIS HE- A TWO. SOME OF THE OTHER A AREAS SLASH HE'S SO IF YOU GO AROUND THAT AREA BAY THERE'S A LITTLE AND THAT'S WHERE THERE'S A COURT SEE ALL. THERE'S A PRETTY DOPE AND AT A BUT IS HE WORKED TREAT FROM THAT'S ALL IT IS A FAIL AND I'M- PRO. SIDE OF THE HILL WE'RE GONNA ESSENTIALLY. PORTION OF YOUR TO PAY. AND THAT A COME UP THE HILL CREDIBLE LET OF SOME KIND OF AN STRUCK TO PUT US FROM THAT A RISK IF YOU TO SEE LIVE AT SEA LEVEL RISE AND A ONCE IN FIFTY YEAR STORM TOMORROW NOW NOT ONLY THAT. OF WERE NOT USING RICHARD EIGHT WE'VE INVESTED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF MONEY IN THIS PROBABLY THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT IS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WILL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL THOSE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS IN OUR CITY COUNCIL HAS STEPPED UP AND SAID THIS IS A WORTHWHILE PROJECT AND OBVIOUSLY WE NEED SUPPORT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RAISE- THE ADDITIONAL UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NECESSARY FOR THAT PROJECT. I'M MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE LET'S KEEP ON THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. I WOULD WANT TO HAVE JUST. A GIPSON ROBBERY RATES. FORMER MRS. OUT A VOTE TO HAVE. HAVE A HE DIDN'T OWN TACK DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS WE RECENTLY HAD A- WATER QUALITY IN FLOOD PROTECTION INITIATIVE THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY 57% OF VOTERS A PORTION OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO THESE KINDS OF FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS. ARE CITIES ABOUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT AN INFRASTRUCTURE BOND THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY- TO FIND- ALAMEDA IS PORTION OF THE PROJECT HOWEVER ON THE NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE IF YOU LOOK AT THE COSTS INVOLVED. UP TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. TO HIGHLAND ALMOST MILLION DOLLARS THE GOOD NEWS IS. INVEST IN THAT MEAN DOCTORS SAY. MADE OF WORDS OF EIGHT THE END UP TO A GROUP ARE NOT ON A MAN. YOU FOR IF YOU STOP PAYING. PLEASE ENTER YOUR FIVE IN THIS CITY BE IN AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PROBABLY COULDN'T COVER- THOSE THAT UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS WITH THE COST THAT'S TO SAY. THE WE'RE GONNA NEED HELP- AND THAT'S I THINK WITH THE STATE MIGHT PLAY A ROLE BOTH IN TERMS OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE BOND OR AT RESILIENCY BOND- THIS NOVEMBER HELPING STREAMLINE HOW CITIES CAN TAP INTO THESE FUNDING SOURCES AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THE CITIES LIKE FOSTER CITY LIKE THE CITY OF ALAMEDA WHERE VOTERS. HAVE ALREADY SHOWN SKIN IN THE GAME BY CONTRIBUTING THEIR OWN TAX DOLLARS AND WITH THAT. MY REMARKS ARE CLOSED.

AS WELL WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS INVOLVED- WITH THAT DISTRICT AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE FUNDING STREAM IS FOR YOUR- HARD. ARMORED YEAH WE'VE HAD SEVERAL THINGS WITH THE FLOOD BRAZILIAN STATES DO YOU RECKON REVISED ON HIS LEADERSHIP SINCE SAN MATEO COUNTY AND FANTASTIC WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND DISCUSSING HOW TO MOVE FORWARD- I THINK THAT'S A FULL WAS A LOOK FURTHER AHEAD AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY AND SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY SO WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW KEEP CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY DO START MOVING PROJECTS FORD WE CAN LOOK AT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT WILL WORK FOR BOTH OF FOR ALL OF OUR AGENCIES FOR THE CITIES. AND FOR SFO. AND THE FUNDING OVER. THE FUND FOR THE AIRPORTS PROGRAM COMES FROM THE PARK REVENUE BONDS IS WHAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR NOW BUT FUNDING WOULD ALWAYS BE- HERE WE WILL LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AS WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING CONSTRUCTION. NOW IT'S STILL YOU KNOW PLANNING AND- GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL SUBMISSION. JUST QUESTION WHICH WHICH I DON'T KNOW COULD BE A KEEPER OR WITH DOCTOR HILL NECKS AND SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT IN CIVIL RIGHTS BUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT HERE. FOSTER CITY THE FACT THAT IT'S BUILT ON PHIL AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING UP SOME LEVEES. AROUND JUST TO A QUESTION ABOUT GEOLOGY AND AM HYDROLOGY. WITH LEVEES LEVEES OBVIOUSLY WOULD SUPPORT SOME SEA LEVEL RISE AND STORM. BUT I ALSO ASSUME THAT THAT THE HYDROLOGY SHOWS THAT THE GROUND WATER IS GOING TO STILL NOT BE AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS THOSE LEVEES GET OLD OR WHAT ARE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WARS THAT'S A MAN DOCTOR HILLS GOING TO BE. ABLE TO ADDRESS BUT I THINK PUBLIC WORKS FOR. HERE I'M I'M IN. I KNOW YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BUT- HOLY COW. IF YOU'RE WRONG. YOU COULD SORT FLOOD FROM THE INSIDE BECAUSE AROUND WHAT WE DO HELP HAVE A SHALLOW GROUNDWATER TABLE. FORTUNATELY WE ALSO HAVE A LAGOON SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY SERVES AS AN ENTITY BUT FOR STORM WATER DETENTION. SO WE'RE ABLE TO CONTROL THE- THE LAGOON SO ANY WATER THAT COMES INTO OUR STORM GREEN SYSTEM ENTERS THE GOON. AND THEN AT OUR CORPORATION YOU ARE WE HAVE A PUMP SYSTEM THAT CAN DISCHARGE. THAT GROUNDWATER SOARING TIRE LAGOON SYSTEM. IS SIX HUNDRED AND SOMETHING ACRES. AND HAS THE CUP SIX FEET DEEP. AND IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO HOLD WATER AND THEN DISCHARGED SO WE DO NEED TO RAISE THE LEVY TO KEEP ALL THE OUTSIDE WATERS FROM COMING IN. AND THEN WE HAVE THE LOGIN SYSTEM THAT HELPS US PUMP NOW. OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS THE QUICKER CONTRIBUTION FROM THE CITY OF ALAMEDA ON THIS- ARE AT THE END THE RESULT OF OUR GROUNDWATER STUDY SH SO. 25% MORE LIGHT. THEN WE ADD. OUR C. LEVEL THIS. SELECT YOUR SON SOME SENSE OF THIS. OF PROBLEM. THANK YOU MAYOR QUESTION WRITER PINE THE NO HE- INTERLOCKING ABOUT THE ISSUE RELATED TO THE- EARLY SAN MATTEO CAN IS APPROACH TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO RELOAD IT ACCOMMODATE PROTECTED AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT IT SEEMS A LOT OF THE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN AROUND PROTECTING THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH I CAN ASK YOU PROVIDE CAROL GROOM FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN TERMS OF LIKE ON THE COAST SIDE WE SEE A LOT MORE EFFORT OR AT LEAST THE COMMUNICATIONS AROUND MANAGED RETREAT.

THAT I HEARD FROM VARIOUS ON THE- FOR FROM SAID HILL. DO BEGIN. A GREAT. MY WE LEARN FROM THE PAST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF THE WILDFIRES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS WE NEED TO PLAN NOW. AVOID DISASTERS. CAN WITHOUT. MAKING ANY KIND OF VALUE JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO THE DISASTER UP NORTH. WHICH MANY OF OUR FAMILIES EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND. I DO WANT TO SAY. TWO FEET OF FLOODING IN. IN THE BAY OR AROUND THEY WILL. BASICALLY MAKE HOMELESS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY AND NINETY. HOW YOU. PROGRAM AND MANY IN THE BEING UNDER. WHO WILL PROBABLY NOT BE A TO REACH TO THE BAY AREA BECAUSE THEY RENT AND WHO KNOWS SPEND THOSE HOUSES WILL THEN BE FIXED. SO I'M NOT SAYING IT'S WORSE I'M SIMPLY SAYING IT'S REALLY REALLY BAD SECOND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS. PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY PREPARE IT ALL YOU DO IS SCARE THE- THIRD WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED PEOPLE TRANSPORTATION WASTE WATER PARKS HABITAT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE NETWORKS RESILIENT NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL ASSETS IN THE BIGGEST ASSET IS PEOPLE RIGHT AROUND HERE AND MADAM CHAIR YOU PROBABLY GOING TO SF. WHEN YOU GO BACK TO S. L. O.

ALL OF US TOUCH THE SAME PROPERTY HAVE DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES BUT WE'RE ALL ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER. SECOND ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE IT YOU SAID. OUR PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE THESE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AND DIFFERENT. SB CDC STARTED A REAL TRAGEDY AT TATIAN. STREET GROUP WHICH IS VERY VOLUNTARY VERY VERY DIVERSE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WORKSHOP IN APRIL. DEDICATED TO HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A STRATEGY REGION WIDE BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE A REGION WIDE. ARE HARD HELP DESK ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES HELPED US SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT UP HERE TALKED ABOUT. THE SENDING AN EMAIL AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING BACK ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CALL BC DC THE PHONE NUMBER IS. THREE FIVE TO THIRTY SIX HUNDRED AND OUR PLANNERS HELP LOCAL PLANNERS EVERY DAY. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL AND REGIONAL PLANNING. BC DC'S PLANNING IS VOLUNTARY. IT WILL REMAIN VOLUNTARY TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT TENSION BETWEEN REGIONAL PLANNING AND LOCAL CONTROL. WELL IT MAY SHIFT A LITTLE BIT CANDIDLY NOTHING AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS GOING TO AFFECT LOCAL CONTROL AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK THROUGH THAT- FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN ASKED WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR A BOND GREAT QUESTION. MY REPLY IS ANY NUMBER YOU WANT IT IS YOUR RIGHT NUMBER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A NUMBER AND HERE'S A CARE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ASK. I WOULD ASK IS A COASTAL ZONE MANAGER THAT AS YOU WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE BOND YOU DON'T CREATE SOMETHING NEW. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE STAFF DEALING WITH THIS PUT THEM AT THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL PUT THEM AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY. PUT THEM AT THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES PC DC THE COST OF COMMISSION THE COSTA CONSERVANCY WE'RE ALREADY DOING THE WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE US HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS. REALLY REALLY QUICKLY. FINALLY LET ME SAY THIS THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES ON BEHALF OF THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY SEVEN YEARS AS THE HEAD OF THE CDC STAFF I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR WITH REGARD ADAPTATION IN SACRAMENTO AND THE ADMINISTRATION. GIVE GOVERNOR BROWN ALL THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD ON MITIGATION AND HE DESERVES MORE THAN HE'S GOT. BUT THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING ADAPTATION TO RISING SEA LEVEL HEAD ON SECRETARY CROWFOOT SECRETARY BLUMENFELD HAVE STARTED TO WORKING GROUP WHICH IS ACTUALLY REALLY WORKING. AND THAT'S REALLY THRILLING FOR THOSE OF US IN THE BUSINESS DR MARKEL THE NEW HEAD OF THE OCEANS PROTECTION COUNCIL IS A STAR AND HE IS MAKING ALL OF US WERE. THE RESILIENCE BOND YOU SEEN THE CAT CLIMBING LIST FUNDING YOU SEEN AND WE'RE STARTING WORK ON PUBLIC AWARENESS THROUGHOUT THE RESOURCES AGENCY SO WE'RE ALL TALKING WITH ONE VOICE ABOUT THE ISSUE WE HAVE TO DO THAT. FINALLY LET ME GIVE YOU THREE GENERAL PRINCIPLES IT'LL TAKE ONE MINUTE TO DO SO. FOR PROTECT PEOPLE FIRST DO NO HARM TO OTHERS WHEN YOU PLAN AND WHEN YOU BUILD WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING DOWN IN THE SOUTHERN END OF THE DAY IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS PEOPLE NORTH OF THE BAY REFLECTION OF WATER HAPPENS WITHIN A BAY VERY VERY QUICKLY SECOND BE PREPARED FOR THE RESOURCES AGENCY TO SAY THAT THE GOAL OF RESILIENCE FOR TWELVE FIFTY SHOULD ACTUALLY BE THREE AND A HALF FEET HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL GUIDANCE NOW SAYS. AND FINALLY WE ARE ALIGNING WITHIN ALL THE STATE FUNDS TO THE SACRAMENTO AND FEEL DISTRICT LEVELS WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND WE NEED TO PROTECT AND EXPAND ACCESS FOR ALL. REALLY PROUD TO HAVE WORK REALLY WELL WITH FOSTER CITY ADD NEW SAW WHAT THEIR PLAN WAS TO EXPAND ACCESS WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN SPITE OF HOUSING SEALER. THANK YOU. SLIDES OF THE STATE. RIGHT OKAY JUST WAITING FOR THE SLICE COME UP AND WHILE I'M WAITING FOR THEM TO COME UP I WANT TO SELL INDOORS 1100% EVERYTHING THAT LOWER GOALS BEN JUST SAID WITH ONE AMENDMENT TO A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO FRIENDLY AMEND THAT SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT STAFFING I THINK IS A STAFFING IT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WORK WITH THE CESIUM AGENCIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL SO ON START WONDER SHOULD BOW- THINK LOOK. NEVER IN THE HIT. WORLD LOW MORE OF A BUSINESS. HUNDRED LET'S HAVE THEM BUT WHEN I WAS UNDER COUNTY SIGNED AND MARK THE MEETING GET MUCH CREDIT THE JOB. MAMA AND SHE'S PAYING YOU WERE RIGHT ON THE ONE PART OF THE REAL. FIVE MAYOR AND THOUSANDS THE LEADERS ACROSS PLAN THIS IT LEGISLATOR YOUR SERVICE AS BIG OF THIS LEVEL YOU OF ALL PEOPLE STAND BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

THINK OF THE DAY I'M THE SENATE LET'S GO ASTRAY ANSWERED SERVE IN THE IDEAL YEAH ALEX JUST TIGHTEN EATERS SEVEN FIVE CENTER FOR I MIDDLE CLASS TWENTY YEARS BY. LOCAL AND STATE LEADERS IN THE BAY AND DELTA REGION BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE MY THREE POINT MESSAGE TODAY IS TO INCENTIVIZE AND SO WORK MATT EXCEPT BRIDGE LINE OUT OF GEN PLEASE ENTER ONE. EXPAND LOCAL CITY TO COLLABORATE ON PLAY IT AND SEE MORE TOURISTS CAN. CATION PLANNING IMPLEMENT. TO I JUST I AND ALSO FOR FRONT LINE LOCAL LEADER. THREE SUPPORT. THE FIRST EX RATE READ MORE LIKE A- SHINING SHORT. THE BILL WORK HIGHLIGHTS THESE GOALS AND **** A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN VET TO PUSH THE- STATEWIDE MAGEN. URGENT OF THE CHALLENGE PLEASE CONSIDER DOUBLING. THE MOUTH THE AREA SUCCESS I. JUST A THAT FUNDING IN THE BAY AREA WERE ALMOST MILLION PEOPLE NINE COUNTIES A HUNDRED WHAT CITIES ESSENTIALLY IN A BATH OVER IN WHAT WE FACE A TRIPLE THREAT STEEL LEVEL RISES AND FLOODING AND RISING WATER THIS MAP SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THE BAY. COMBINE THE LEVEL RISE AND LOCAL FLOODING HAS KILLED. CAROL NOTED RISING GROUP WATER IS FOR THE COMPOUND THAT ALLEN ASSEMBLY MULLIN NOTED THE THIRDS OF THE STATE ENTIRE AT RISK ECONOMIC ASK SHORELINE ASSETS ARE IN THE BAY AREA TODAY'S CURRENT VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS IS CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION JUST IN THE BAY AREA ALONE. THAT'S WHY THE BAY AREA IS A GREAT CASE STUDY FOR THE TYPE OF SUCCESS LOCAL OPERATIONS PUNCH STRING JUST TAKE IT OLD IN A VERY LOW AND WEBER PLANNING WITH SCIENCE IN TECH SUPPORT. BEGUN TO THE FIRE GOVERNMENT'S PERMITTED IN CLASS PATIENT AN EXPLORATION SHIN BUT WITH STATE COURT AGREED LOCAL CITY WE'RE JUST BE INTO. THIS CHALLENGE NUMBER. EIGHTY ABOVE AVERAGE. HE WENT ALL FIND A STRATEGY BUT WHEN TO RAISE. RATE IS NOW COMPLETE BY IT AND COUNTY. DURATION TOWARD THE EIGHTIES AND ARE MET WALTON TRANSFER AGENCY OR PUTTING ON REGIONAL PLAN AND CONCERT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SURE DOES SHALL WITHIN. NINETY PLACE SINCE IN ADDITION WOKE GOVERNMENTS TO ORGANIZE ON THEIR OWN JOURNAL WORKS TO SHIP DATA PORTANTINO REGIONAL VERSIONS CHAU IS A STRATEGIC INITIAL. BAY AREA PUBLIC WORKS AND DOES WHAT CONTROL AGENCIES BAKER IS AND NOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND POLICY STUFF WE'RE DOING. A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF ADAPTATION. I WANT ONE A QUICK. YEAH THEY ARE NOT UP TO BALANCE THIS IS COOL REALLY COOL AT SFE I WE PARTNER WITH SPUR A BAY AREA URBAN PLANNING RESEARCH GROUP WITH LOCAL REGIONAL STATE FEDERAL EXPERTS PRODUCE ALISTAIR PROVIDES AN INVENTORY OF REGIONAL SCIENCE LOCAL DECISION MAKERS A SUITE OF NATURE BASED GREEN AND GRAY HYBRID SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE MULTI BENEFIT ADAPTATION SOLUTIONS AND LOCAL. MAPS WITH. SPECIFIC CHARLOTTE LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO DATE ALL PASS THROUGH THE JUST SO YOU. THERE'S FROM ABOUT MAPS IN THIS THE PROVIDE TWENTY SIX YEARS OF DATA GATHERED THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA TO PROVIDE LOCAL PLANNERS WITH REGIONAL INFORMATION WE KNOW THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION IS A REGIONAL ISSUE BUT 90% OF THE LAND USE ISSUES TO DEAL WITH REGIONAL ADAPTATION ARE MADE AT THE LOCAL CITY AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT. SO THE CHALLENGE FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION IS ALMOST REALLY A GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE CHALLENGE HOW DO YOU GET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE. WHERE THE HECK ARE WE GONNA FIND THE BIRDS OF THE SAID IT'S GONNA TAKE TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. MAPS NICKEL AT THE IN THE- BAY AREA DEMINT. THAT WE'RE DOING A GREAT OF MINIMUM. SO I'M JUST GONNA GO LOOKING THE CONCLUSION IS BUT THE BAY AREA HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE COLLABORATIONS THAT WORK AUSTRIA ACTIONS WHICH NEEDS IT'S A TWO AND- LOCAL CAPACITY. THAT COAST ON MANTA BUT PART OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION YOU DECIDE COSTA CONSERVANCY TO DO THIS OF CENTRAL WORK THE LA- REPORT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT THOSE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BUT MANY LOCAL AND REGIONAL PLAYERS BUSINESS GOVERNMENT CIVIC ARE POISED TO MAKE THIS A NATIONAL MODEL PLEASE REVIEW AND CONSIDER THE POLICY. THE LA A REPORT WITH YOUR SUPPORT CALIFORNIA SHORELINE COMMUNITIES CAN BECOME A NATIONAL MODEL OF HOW URBAN REGIONS AT THE EDGE OF THE SEA PROVIDE BOLD EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK I WE HAVE UNDER. TEN MINUTES LEFT IN THE HEARING ON TWO ONE A LOT OF TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY QUICK QUESTIONS. AND QUICKER ANSWERS FROM. AYE AYE. THE ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING DOCTOR WE SHOW THE PICTURES OF FLOATING. HOME AT HOUSES OUT THERE AND NOT ADVOCATING OR SUGGESTING OR ANYTHING BUT IMAGE TO ME CAME TO MIND OF THE- FUTURE CITY OF DUMBARTON. LEAVE IT. IMAGINE A WING. OKAY THANK YOU SO NOW I LIKE TO CALL PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU LIKE TO COME- SPEAK- PLEASE LINE UP BECAUSE THE INTEREST OF TIME WILL ALLOW ONE MINUTE PER COMMON FEEL FREE TO DO LESS- AND- COME COME ONE OF. THE THIRTY. BECAUSE HI THANK YOU ENSURE DEVICE MAYOR CITY OF MILLBRAE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE SHORELINE WE ALSO HAVE THREE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT FLOOD ONE HAS FLOODED EVERY YEAR BECAUSE WE ARE PARTNERS FOR LACK OF PARTNERS ARE SAN FRANCISCO SFO SFPUC CALTRAIN BARRED HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WE CAN'T ACCESS THE AREAS THAT CLEAN UP THE COVERS SOMEWHERE NEIGHBORHOODS FLOOD I'D BE A LOT MORE DIPLOMATIC BUT I CAN'T DO IT IN A MINUTE I'M SORRY CAN I DO THIS- ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO HELP OTHER FLOODING AND OTHER CITIES IS TO DRINK HOME A CREEK IN THE WETLANDS THAT. DIVIDE US FROM ONE A ONE TWO BILBRAY ONE A ONE TO TEN BRUNO YOU KNOW REGIONALLY THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO THAT WILL FLOOD MY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THERE HAS TO BE. IT'S CROSSED INTO F. I AM FOR. BECAUSE I SAW. OR NOISE FOR TABLE I'VE BEEN ON IT FOR YEARS WHEN I CHECKED THE OLD HE I ARE. NOT ONE MITIGATION TO MY COMMUNITY FOR INCREASED NOISE FOR EXPANSION OF THE AIRPORT BOTH FACILITIES AND RUNWAYS. I AM SCARED TO DEATH THE WORK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ON. ON A BAY RESILIENT SHE IS GOING TO LEAVE MY LITTLE TEENY TOWN. THAT HAS NO POLITICAL POWER OUT BECAUSE OTHER CITIES HAVE MORE POWER FOR US AND WE HAVE TO SEPARATE FOR THE BETTER OF THE REST. THANK MARKS. THE CIVIC HAN OCEANSIDE I'VE PREPARED REMARKS IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M HERE BECAUSE- SEN TATIAN TODAY WAS PRETTY SANTA OCEANSIDE AND TO ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE- BAY AREA RESILIENCY WORK WILL NOT BE AFFORDED PACIFICA BECAUSE THE GIRL IN THE ROOM THE COASTAL COMMISSION WILL NOT TOLERATE IT AND IN FACT IS OPENLY AND PERSISTENTLY HOSTILE TO CHARLOTTE PROTECTIONS. SO I'M SORT OF THE CANARY IN THE GOLD MINE AND IN THE A COAL MINE. THERE IS A FACILITY- THE RV PARK BE CLOSE THE COMMISSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF PUNCHING A FIVE ACRE HOLE IN AN EXISTING ROCK ARMORING. AND WITHIN SEVEN YEARS IT'S GOING TO BE ON HIGHWAY ONE. SO WE HAVE A SERIOUS POLICY DISCUSSION TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IF IN FACT CHANGING THE COASTAL ACT TO ENABLE THE CIVICA. TO BE AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS SFO IN GOOGLE HEADQUARTERS WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED OTHERWISE VERY SERIOUS AMOUNTS OF PROPERTY VALUES ARE GOING TO GO IN THE WATER. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS REUVEN EVERY COME A COUNCIL MEMBER IN EAST PALO ALTO NEXT TO PALO ALTO WHICH IS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHERE ACTION SAN MATEO COUNTY TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE- A VERY BRAVE. AND COURAGEOUS COMMITTEE FOR WHAT'S COMING UP IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR SO LONG. BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO. DO EVERYTHING AS A STATE- GOVERNMENT TO NOT ONLY WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT REALLY PUSHES HARD. I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP ON IN OUR LOCAL CONTROL. AND WE NEED TO GO BEYOND THAT I THINK ALSO WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE'RE RIGHT NEXT TO FACEBOOK AND WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR MANY YEARS DAVID PINE. GORE RICHARD GARDEN KNOWS THAT WE GET FLOODED BY THE CREEK BY THE TIGHT BY THE COMBINATION AND NOW WE AND ALSO FROM GROUND WATER. AND SO FOR US. IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE FACT THAT FACEBOOK IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR THEY'RE GONNA HAVE JOINING. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY SO ALSO I THINK PAYING ATTENTION TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THIS IS BEEN SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. CONGRATULATE ALL THE WORK THAT EVERYONE'S. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MERRIMENT TELE AND I'M AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST AT THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION ON OUR STATEWIDE PLANNING TEAM. I'M ALSO A RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF ALAMEDA CITIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES- WE RECOGNIZE AT SEA LEVEL RISE IS A STATE WIDE PROBLEM IT'S COMPLICATED IT'S EMOTIONAL- BUT OUR SOLUTIONS WILL NEED TO BE LOCAL. I CAME HERE TODAY TO LISTEN AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE VARIETY OF. LOCAL PERSPECTIVES ON SEA LEVEL RISE ADAPTATION. THIS CAN HELP OUR STATE AGENCIES- AS WE WORK ON SEA LEVEL RISE PLANNING OUR STAFF WORKED CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THE LEFT RISE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS ADAPTATION PLANS. AND COASTAL PROGRAM UPDATES. AND THE COMMISSION HAS PROVIDED OVER A THE DOLLARS PLANNING. TO OUR AND LOCALS FOR OVER FORTY CITIES AND COUNTIES OUT OF SEVENTY SIX HAVE THESE GRANTS ARE WORKING ON SEA LEVEL RISE PLANNING. LYING TO HELP WE'VE PROVIDED GUIDANCE ONCE YOU LOW RISE PLANNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE UPDATED THAT WITH SCIENCE AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON GUIDANCE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE. THANK YOU MADAM TERRIBLE COLLEAGUES AND EMILY BEACH THE MAYOR OF CITY BURLINGAME AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE PRES FOR SUPERVISOR PINES LEADERSHIP. A CEMETERY COUNTY IS KNOWN FOR INCREDIBLE COLLABORATION AND HE'S REALLY LED THE WAY WITH CSC LEVEL RISE RESILIENCY DISTRICT SO WE ARE ALL IN A REGIONAL APPROACH. LITTLE CITIES DO NEED THOSE STAFF RESOURCES AT THESE REGIONAL PLACES TO DO THE SCIENCE A WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HIRE OUR OWN STAFF TO DO THIS. SO THE MORE YOU CAN HELP STAFF UP AND- PROVIDE THE PLANNING IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMON ABOUT EMPOWERING LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION SO WHAT BURLINGAME DID WITH THE REGIONAL STUDY THAT THE COUNTY- PROVIDED WE TOOK IT HIGHER CONSULTANT FOR A YEAR. STUDIED ARE THREE MILES OF SHORELINE AND WE DISCOVERED THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT YOU KNOW EVEN OUR LITTLE SHORELINE HAS FIVE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF WAYS WE CAN BUILD GREEN LEVEES INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN REALLY. HELP THE SEA LEVEL RISE ISSUE NOT ONLY TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMIC ENGINE ON THE FRONT ALSO PROTECT HIGHWAY ONE A ONE AND THE CALTRAIN COURT WHICH IS A STEP. ARE AND ALSO PLEASE IN. I CALTRAIN. THANK YOU. THANK MADAM CHAIR A COMMITTEE MANY IS LINDA SHE AND I A RESIDENT RED WITH BUT I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS A CONSULTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL- AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE COUNCIL I WANTED TO TAKE OFF THREE POINTS BECAUSE THE CDC'S ELLERY GO SPEND SAID DID SUCH AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB SUMMARIZING THE REST OF THEM ON THE FIRST IS THAT CALIFORNIA FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR PROTECTING CAUSED AN OCEAN- HAS BEEN CONCLUDING ITS PUBLIC COMMENT AND UP FOR OPC ADOPTION. THE MEETING ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIX AND A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE IS WE ARE PLANNING FOR- THREE POINT FIVE FOOT TARGET PORTS LEVEL RISE PLANNING FOR TWENTY FIFTY AS WELL AS INSURING ADDITIONAL THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF COASTAL WETLANDS ARE PROTECTED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ON THE EARLY SIDE THANK YOU YOU IN THE LOWER PRICE SCIENCE FOR STRUCTURE PLANNING SECOND ON THE SEA LEVEL RISE GUIDANCE- THAT GUIDANCE DOES HAVE A PREFERRED AND RECOMMENDED. YES CALL GENERALLY IS THE W. DIRECTOR OF A PIECE EM CAN ADDRESS ANY. AND THE FINAL ON FUNDING WE SUPPORT THE BOND MEASURE- PROVISIONS WITH REGARD TO NEED TO BE SOLUTION THAT SARAH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ARE YOU I WAS THE OPC STRATEGIC PLAN RECOMMENDS THAT THE COUNCIL AND THE STATE CONSIDERED LOCAL LAND USES LOCALLY AND IS PLANNING BY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THAT THAT SHOULD BE AN EARLY PRIORITY FOR- ALL STATE MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRAD BENSON AND THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO'S WATERFRONT RESILIENCE DIRECTOR- WE HAVE SOME PRETTY BIG EFFORTS UNDER WAY ON THE SAN FRANCISCO WATERFRONT WE'VE GOT. VERY URGENT SEISMIC RISK WITH OUR SEA WALL PROGRAM FODOR'S ADOPTED A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO HELP WITH THAT. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ON A FLOOD STUDY FIRST AND A HALF MILES OF THE CITY'S WATERFRONT. BUT I WOULD SAY TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BOND. IT'S THIS WORK IS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE FOR THE NORTHERN WATER FROM WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH EVEN FOR A CITY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS A GREAT DEAL OF WEALTH. THAT WILL OVERWHELM THE CITY'S CAPITAL BUDGET AND WE'RE SEEING THE NEED TO ADAPT OVER DECADES AND SO THE WORK NEEDS TO START NOW NOT JUST IN THE CITY AROUND THE DAY. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS HAVING HEARINGS LIKE THIS AND- I WILL. PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION TO THE- THANK YOU I THINK EVERYBODY HERE TODAY WERE OPEN UP TO THE PANEL FOR FINAL COMMENTS I KNOW WERE A LITTLE BIT LATE BY THE- OPEN UP TO FIND A COMMON. NO.
