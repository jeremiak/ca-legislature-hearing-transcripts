WE SERVE ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IMPERIAL COUNTY. NANCY BARGE IN THE IT DIRECTOR OF THE ARMS OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WE ARE THE FASTEST GROWING REGIONAL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.

EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAVE LOWER CASE LOADS FOR EARLY START THINGS LIKE THAT BEFORE THE AVERAGE USEFUL FOR MOSES BUT EIGHTY EIGHT WE WOULD NEED SIXTY ADDITIONAL SERVICE GREATER SKINNER IN ORDER. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH GISELE RATIO REQUIREMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU FOR YOUR REMARKS ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR RECENTLY -- AS REPORTED IN THE WAS OF THE SOLANO COUNTY DALY REPUBLIC. INADEQUATE RACE CREED OF A CHALLENGE AS YOU KNOW -- THE CHALLENGE TO ATTRACT AND KEEP QUALIFIED STAFF FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE OF THE EFFECTIVE LOW RATES. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE SERVING WITH EXTREMELY CHALLENGING DANGEROUS BEHAVIORS DANGERS SELF AND OTHERS IS GROWING. YOU OPTIONS ARE BEING CREATED LIKE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES HAS BEHAVIORAL. PROBLEMS HOWEVER FINING PAIN QUALIFIED STAFF FOR THOSE OPTIONS IS BECOME EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF THE RATES. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR NEGOTIATED RATE HOMES. ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR PERSONAL SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS. IN HAS BEEN HEROES FOR HOMES AND OTHERS THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING OF FOR CLIENTS WHO WILL BE MOVING FROM THE COMMUNITY A TO THE COMMITTEE FROM DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. AS WE PLAN TO CLOSE ORDER DRILL AND THE FOR EVERY DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. WE HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TWELVE LOCAL SENATORS AND SO MANY MEMBERS IN OUR AREA WE APPRECIATE THEM A LOT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM -- AS WE ADVOCATE -- FOR INCREASED RATES FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STAFF BUT THE ISSUE OF DISPARITY FOR FIRST SERVICE. IN THEIR MATERIALS ADVOCATES CORRECTLY STATE THAT THE PER CAPITA ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR LEFT THE HOUSE TO THE FAR LEFT YOU KNOW CLIENTS -- OR SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND THE PER CAPITA FOR WHITE CLIENTS OR SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THIS IS A COMPARISON FOR CLIENTS OF ALL AGES. AND IT'S ONLY A PART OF THE STORY. WHEN THE DATA ARE SEPARATE INTO THREE AGE GROUPINGS WE FIND THE REST OF THE STORY? SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER FOR EXAMPLE SPENDS MORE. ON LATINO INFANTS AND TODDLERS THEIR OWN WHITE INTERESTS OF DOLLARS AGES BIRTH. UP TO THREE YEARS. FOR LATINO CLIENTS INSTANCES DOLLARS EXPENDITURES ARE FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY AND FOR WHITE INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE. FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE BUT SHOULD FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AGES THREE TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. EXPENDITURES FOR LESBIANS ARE THREE THOUSAND SIXTY DOLLARS AND FOR WHITES THEY ARE FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN OR NINETY NINE DOLLARS SO THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. THE DIFFERENCES FOR DAHLE CLIENTS ARE THE MOST PRONOUNCED CLIENTS. 270-009-0040 DOLLARS FOR WHITE PLAINS. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS AUTHORIZED EXPENDED CAN BE DIFFERENT AMONG THE VARIOUS ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS. IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE DIFFERENCES. AMONG THE ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS PRIMARILY REFLECT SUCH AS SOME CULTURES ARE LESS LIKELY TO CHOOSE A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT OPTION. RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT IS OUR MOST COSTLY SERVICE AND THERE ARE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MORE WHY CLIENTS IN RESIDENTS PLACEMENT BAM BUT YOU KNOW POINTS. SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER SPENDS ALMOST SIX HUNDRED MILLION MORE. A RESIDENTIAL PLACE FOR FOR WHY CLIENTS THAN FOR LIFE YOU KNOW POINTS. WHEN THE RESIDENTS PLACEMENT VARIABLES REMOVED? MOST OF THE DISPARITY DISAPPEARS. THE PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES ARE ABOUT A NOW ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LIKE YOU KNOW POINTS IN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LIKE. THE GOAL OF THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE A CULTURALLY INFORMED INSENSITIVE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT ENSURES ALL CLIENTS IN BROWN'S RECEIVE EXCEPT EXEMPLARY CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND THE SERVICES THEY NEED. RATHER THAN THE GOAL OF EACH ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUP HAVING THE SAME PURCHASE A SERVICE PROFILE. WE STRIVE TO SET RELEVANT OUTCOME MEASURES SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICE. OF REGIONAL CENTER STAFF ACCESSIBILITY [INAUDIBLE] TIMELINESS RESPECTFUL MISS PROFESSIONALISM SENSITIVITY TO RACE AND ETHNICITY PASSAGE TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND AND BE A HELPFUL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE PARTNER. TWO YEARS AGO. WE EMBARKED ON A CUSTOMER SERVICE CAMPAIGN. ALL STAFF ARE TRAINED BY PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANT PROVIDE EXCELLENT EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE OUTCOMES OF THE CAMPAIGN WE REDESIGN OUR CLIENT AND FAMILY SATISFACTION. SURVEY NOW HAS A FOCUS ON NINE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER SERVICE DIMENSIONS AND ONE OVERALL SATISFACTION SCORE. FIVE THOUSAND RANDOMLY SELECTED SERVICE WERE MAILED TO CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY WERE RETURN WHICH IS A GOOD NUMBER. RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY THEIR ETHNICITY THEY IDENTIFIES WHITE. ASIAN AFRICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK. FILIPINO ENOUGH YOU KNOW. THE RAVENS ACROSS ALL ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS WERE CONSISTENTLY HIGH AVERAGING FOUR POINT. FIVE ON A FIVE POINT RATING SCALE. ALL RESPONDENTS RIVER REPRESENTING VARIOUS ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS REPORTED BEING TREATED BY REGIONAL CENTER STAFF RESPECTFULLY IN EARLY. CELL CHANGE OF SUBJECT THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER IS A LEADER IN CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR PERSONS WILL DEVELOP RULES REALLY SIMPLE SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE COLLABORATION WITH A FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I HELPED TO CREATE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING COLLABORATIVE.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE AS PROVIDERS OUR FATE. AS WELL AS MY PERSONAL STORY STRUGGLES MY FAMILY AS FACING. FIRST A BRIEF HISTORY OF GUIDING HANDS SINCE OUR INCEPTION IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE I'M A GUIDING THIS IS PROVIDED BENCHMARK PROGRAM AND HOUSING FOR MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. HHH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF SUPPORTS AND SERVE AS AN INDIGO COUNTING SERVING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED INFANTS. LESSONS IN ADULTS. OVER THE YEARS HHS EXPANDED. PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICE FOR ALL AGES. FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT SERVICING AND FIX AND TODDLERS. RESIDENT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS. IN HOME RESPITE SERVING ALL AGES. COMMUNITY LIVING PROGRAM COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES TRANSPORTATION RIGHTY OF QUALITY OF LIFE PROGRAM. LIKE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WITH OUR INDUSTRY WE'RE FACING A FUN CRISIS. AS RECALL BY EIGHTY X. TWO ONE THE DEPARTMENT OF SERVICES COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATES. PLEASE ENTER RATE STUDY. AND SO THE RAPE MODELS. WHILE THEY'RE STILL SOME DEBATE ON ELEMENTS OF THE RATE STUDY IT DOES PROVIDE US BUT I SYSTEM. WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON AND WHAT THE RATE STUDY DOES HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER DRASTICALLY UNDERFUNDED? IT'S STUDY SHOWED THAT THE INDUSTRY. WE ARE 40% UNDER FIRE. ONE OF PROGRAMS THAT H. H. PROVIDES IS TRANSPORTATION. WE PROVIDE. SERVICES FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY IN RITUALS DALY PROVIDING ACCESS INTO THE COMMUNITY. TRANSPORTATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER ESPECIALLY IN SAN DIEGO IT'S HARD TO GET ANY WORK OUT TRANSPORTATION. OUR SO WITHOUT WAS MUCH NEEDED SERVICES WERE LIMITING THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY. I'M. AT HOME OF GUIDING HAND OUR TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT. IS RUNNING FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN THE NEGATIVE. NOW I'M NOT THE CFO OF THE COMPANY BUT EVEN I CAN FIGURE OUT THAT AT THAT RATE OF LOS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT MUCH LONGER. ANOTHER CRISIS WE ARE FACED THE STAFFING CRISIS. HOME OF GUIDING HANDS WITH WE HAVE A 40% TURNOVER IN THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS. I'M CREATING A WORKFORCE CRISIS. THIS CRISIS THREATENS THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF PEOPLE WITH. DISABILITIES ARE THE DIRECT PRESS PROVIDERS WHO ARE TIRED WITH WORKING LONG HOURS OR MULTIPLE JOBS. MUCH MORE LIKELY TO MAKE MISTAKES. HAVE A LOWER TOLERANCE FOR STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. WHEN THE SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT KNOW THE PERSON FOR WHOM THEY ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT? THEY MAY NOT RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS ILLNESS. THE CONSISTENCY OF THE DIRECT SERVICE TURN OVER AND THEY CAN SEE RATE. IMPACT INDEPENDENCE AND OPPORTUNITIES EXPERIENCED BY THE PEOPLE WE SUPPORT. THE IMPACT OF THE WORK FORCE CRISIS IS ALSO AND SIMPLE LIFE AND WELL BEING OF THE FAMILY. SO SHIFTING GEARS I'M ALSO A FAMILY MEMBER -- SO LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY STORY. SO MY DAUGHTER. LIKE MOST YOUNG ADULTS SHE HAS A PASSION FOR LIFE. LOVES MUSIC ENJOYED MEETING NEW PEOPLE AND DANCE. SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS BORN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH WILLIAM. ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN YOU MEET JULIA SHE DEEP SEEDED LOVE EVERYBODY WE CAN LEARN A LOT. FROM HER. WHEN SHE MEETS YOU YOU GUYS ARE BEST FRIENDS FOR LIFE REMEMBER FIVE YEARS LATER WHAT CONVERSATION WAS THE FIRST TIME WHAT YOU'RE WEARING? EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. BY. YOUNG ADULTS HER PASSION IS TO MOVE OUT ON HER OWN. AND SHE STARTED THAT JOURNEY A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. SENSE SHE HAS HAD THREE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS. SHE'S HAD. ARE. THREE SERVICE COORDINATORS FROM THE CENTER. FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS CHANGED IN FOUR YEARS. AS YOU HEARD ME TALK A LITTLE BIT CAPTION AND HER LOVE FOR PEOPLE. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW SHE TAKES AT SO AT THIS POINT NOW YOU CAN. SHE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING HER GOAL. IN ADDITION SHE TO US ALL. SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE LEAVES SHE FEELS ARE LEAVING BECAUSE OF HER. SO THE WHOLE PROCESS HAS TO START OR WHERE SHE BUILDS TRUST RELATIONSHIP. I THAT TIME CHANGED -- STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN -- SO SHE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HER MEETING HER GOAL. SO IN CLOSING. AS A PROVIDER I'D ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING -- YOUR LEADERSHIP AND DEDICATION -- IS IMPRESSIVE SO PLEASE KEEP IT UP. OUR AS A FAMILY MEMBER I'D ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM KEEP PUSHING. THE REAR END INCREASE WHILE SOME AT SEARS X. EXCESS WAS A SUCCESS WE WENT FROM. ZERO EIGHT POINT. TWO THAT'S A SUCCESS WHILE WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT WE KEEP THE PRESSURE GOING. KEEP PUSHING AND KEEPING US ALL. THANK YOU. WELL DEEP REACHING FROM THE UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY AND THEN ALSO A SAN DIEGO AND ALSO OR CENTOS FROM MARK OF IMPERIAL VALLEY. WHICH BOTH COME UP AND THEN. I GAVE YOU CAN START FIRST AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OUR THANK YOU BOTH GENTLEMEN FOR BEING HERE THIS EVENING. SORRY PLEASURE THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU UP THERE FOR THE THE EFFORT YOU MADE IN TERMS OF GETTING THE RECENT INCREASE. TO GO THROUGH -- I'LL BEGIN BY SAYING MY NAME IS DAVE COURAGE AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY I'VE BEEN THERE FOR FORTY SIX YEARS LAST TWENTY ONE AS THE EXACT I STARTED WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND I'LL ALSO SAY I'LL. BEGIN BY SAYING THE BEST THREE IN HIS WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE [INAUDIBLE] SO [INAUDIBLE] OUR AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE I THINK IT'S AN AND IT SENDS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE AND I THINK IT'S TANTAMOUNT TO FIRING FOR SHOP BASICALLY IN TERMS OF REPAIRING THINGS AND AND HELPING. FAMILIES TO GET THEIR SERVICES PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THEM OF WORKERS TO STAY EMPLOYED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AT U. C. P. WERE MORE MORE LANDED IN PROGRAMS AND RESIDENTIAL AND SOME OF THOSE. HAVE -- HAVE SEEN THE INCREASE AND SOME HAVE NOT AND THERE'S A TRANSITION GOING ON AS WELL. HOW THAT MIGHT LOOK WITH THE NEW AGE CBS REGULATIONS OR WHATEVER? I WILL ONLY ADD THAT HAVE A RANGE OF CONSUMER CHOICES. HELPS TO REVIVE THE RICH QUALITY OF LIFE IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE THAN JUST IT'S IMPORTANT WHERE THEY LIVE. WE GET THAT. BUT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THEIR IN THEIR IN THEIR HOURS TO DATE IN RICHER LIVES OR EDUCATE IN THEIR WORK POSSIBILITIES AND ALL THOSE. I THINK ARE GOING TO BE VERY. LONG WAY AND SO I THINK -- AS A STATE AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE NEED MORE CARE IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE MAKING OUR CHOICES. WHAT WE FIND IN WHAT WE DON'T AND AGAIN WE'RE HERE TO HELP IF YOU NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING WE CAN GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT ESTARÁ THINGS ARE GOING. WE ALSO ARE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE ROOM I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM TOTALLY BUT IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP GOOD STAFF. BASED ON WHAT THE WAGES ARE LOOKING LIKE. AND EVEN WITH THE BUMPS IN. IN THE MINIMUM WAGE I THINK CAN ALL AGREE THOSE ARE NOT LIVEABLE WAGE LAWS ARE MINIMUM WAGE. SO I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF PROTECTING THAT AND ALONG WITH THAT QUALITY PEOPLE ARE WORKING THERE. AND GOOD SERVICES ARE BEING PUT FORTH SAFE SERVICES IMPORTANT SERVICE SAYS. I WON'T BE ON TRANSITIONING SOME OF OURS TO NEW REGULATIONS COMING UP AND I THINK IT'S IT'S FOR GOAL TO STAY THE SAME ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE THERE FOR WE TRY TO BE INNOVATIVE. WE TRY TO PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES -- IT'LL TAKE TIME SO WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AGAIN AS WERE. WERE DECIDING WHAT WE FIND WHAT WE DON'T FUND BECAUSE THERE'S A TRANSITION GOING ON AND IT COULD CAUSE. SOME COULD STORE STAFF. BECAUSE CONSTRUED PROGRAMS. YES I THINK AGAIN I WOULD ONLY SAY LET'S SPEAKER -- CARLOS FLORES MENTION OBVIOUSLY WHICH WERE ALL AWARE OF THE PLAN -- ENACT. OUR I REALLY DO THINK THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES US FROM THE REST OF THE NATION IN THE WORLD HAVE ENTITLEMENTS NOBODY ELSE HAS I THINK WE SHOULD BE. FIERCELY PROUD OF THAT I THINK IT IT SHOWS UP IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOT LONG WAITING LISTS FOR SERVICES IN OUR STATE. TALKING TO COUNTERPARTS PART OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT YOU SEE P.. WHAT CLICK IN THE STATE'S IN TEXAS AND ARIZONA THEY'RE THEY'RE QUEUING UP WITH NOWHERE TO GO AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS DOING A BETTER JOB WITH THAT? AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS. TO HELP GUIDE US SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE WE WILL BE VERY PROTECTIVE OF IT AND WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF IT WE ARE DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. SOME. BUT I I AGAIN WE DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. CONSUMERS HAVE A CHOICE THE THREE SELF DETERMINATION IF IT'S NOT THAT WAY AT ANY RATE IT NEEDS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO ENRICH THEIR LIVES. THAT'S NOT IT IT'S MORE THAN JUST BERMAN HONESTLY WHERE MY WAKING UP. IT'S LIKE WHAT IS ONE DAY NO. AT UCP WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. FOR EVERYTHING FROM -- STUDENTS SUPPORTS. GOING TO COLLEGE -- WE DO WORK TRAINING AND PLACEMENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. I KNOW SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MENTION TRANSPORTATION THAT'S WHY I STARTED IT YOU SEE HE I WAS DRIVING THE VAN. TO AND FROM COLLEGE CLASSES -- IN THE MORNING IN THE AFTERNOON AND THEN I WOULD WORK AT U. C. P. A LITTLE OF THAT WORKING IN OUR PROGRAM SERVICES SIDE. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THERE FROM PUSH THE BROOM DRIVING THE VAN WORKING PROGRAM RAISING MONEY. AND AGAIN FOR THE LAST TWENTY SOME YEARS. DIRECTOR AND GO HOME AND I WONDER WHERE THE NEXT DOLLARS COM. SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN HERE BUT WE'VE NOT BEEN GREAT AT IT TERMS SAFEGUARDING THAT'S A TWO SINCE. WE'RE GONNA NEED YOUR HELP TO CONTINUE ON THIS PATH. AND I AGAIN I I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'VE DONE. BUT I THINK WE'RE THERE'S MORE TO COME THERE'S MORE TO DO SO I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THE HAVE NOTS. THAT'S A GOOD THING SO. WE'RE THERE WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE THIS IS OUR SIXTY FIRST YEAR. SERVICE IN THE SENIOR. AND YOU GET TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR REGIONAL CENTER INCLUDING. OUR LEGISLATORS IN SACRAMENTO. AND IT WON'T WORK UNLESS THAT CONTINUE SO I WOULD ONLY. YOUR SEATS -- BUT KEEP GOING I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. THEY DESERVE OUR RESPECT AND THEY DESERVE OUR HEART. THANK YOU -- SUPER I LOVE BEING ON MICROPHONES. HI AM ARTS SOME TO SOME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARK OF IMPERIAL VALLEY. WHERE ON LOCAL MEMBER UNIT OF THE ARK? WE WERE STABILIZATION TEEN. SEVENTY THREE AND THIS TUESDAY WAS MY TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF BEING WITH THE ARK IN CENTRAL THANK YOU. WE OPERATE -- DAY PROGRAMS TRANSPORTATION GROUP HOMES. ADULT PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY. EVERY SINGLE OF MY PROGRAMS HAS A WAITING LIST. WE SERVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CONSUMERS. ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS THE WAITING LIST WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR HOMES. LIKE CARLOS MEN IN THERE TO CULTURAL ISSUE. THE IMPAIR VALLEY IS 90% -- MEXICAN LATINO SO THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA. ON SO IT KIND OF RELATES WHAT CARDS WITH SAME. I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE FROM A RURAL COMMUNITY. IT'S THE WORD IS EMPLOYMENT. RIGHT NOW THE IMPAIR THE ONLY HAS AN ON WOMEN EIGHT OF 16% AS A SUMMER COMES UP IT'S ONLY GONNA JUMP TO TWENTY IT'S BEEN OVER -- TWENTY FIVE AND THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRILL DOWN. FIRST OF ALL AS MY PARTNERS HAVE BEEN MENTIONING THE ON THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE IN THE TWO PROGRAMS. AND THAT FULL EMPLOYMENT. AT 16% UNEMPLOYMENT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US FIND PLACEMENT FOR A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE. OUR ARK HAS OPENED BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WE OPEN UP AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. WE HAVE TWO RESTAURANTS PLUS A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN IT SOUNDS GROOVY THAT WE DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT IT'S JUST MORE HEADACHE FOR US BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW RESTAURANTS ARE. ARE DIFFICULT. ON TUESDAY WAS A GOOD DAY YES HE WAS A BAD DAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO TRY TO KEEP THINGS GOING IT'S DIFFICULT TO FUND RAISE WHEN. THERE'S JUST THAT MUCH LITTLE POT. AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT TO BRING UP HAVING TO DO WITH UNEMPLOYMENT IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY STAFF WORKS THE GROUP HOME. IS WORKING OVERTIME. TODAY WE HAD -- INTERVIEWS. SIX PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP. OURS CONSUMERS ARE OLDER NOW WE FAIL AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TWO VERSES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PAY. PEOPLE ARE NOT SHOWING UP. AND IT'S SCARY FOR US BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME THINGS SO THAT THE WE CAN ATTRACT. QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO PROVIDE VERY VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES AS PROVIDERS USUALLY GET THE IDEA THAT THERE'S MORE AND MORE WANTED FROM US MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. MORE PROFESSIONALISM BUT THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE PROFESSIONALS. NOT REALLY THERE -- FOR EXAMPLE IN MY ARC WE HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED IN THE STATE. BUT HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE THAT MEXICO. BECAUSE WHAT WE PAY IF YOU LIVE IN MEXICO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO WELL [INAUDIBLE] COMFORTABLY. MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T GET THE SAME OPPORTUNITY OR SO WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE FRESH A COLLEGE THAT HAVE STUDIED IN MECCA -- WHAT ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THEY GET THEIR FEET WET WITH US? IN BE NICE AND ONCE IN AWHILE WE CAN GET PEOPLE IN WHO ARE VERY VERY EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S JUST REALLY WHAT I WANT TO DRILL DOWN. THE CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW REGIONAL CENTER. IT IS A REGIONAL SITUATION. BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM. FROM CARLOS AND REGIONAL CENTER HE'S NICE ENOUGH TO BRING SOME OF THE PROVIDERS DOWN TO THE VALLEY. SO WE CAN ALL SHARE WHAT WE'RE ALL DAY. AND OF COURSE. ANYTHING THAT YOU WANNA KNOW FROM OUR LITTLE -- THE WORLD WILL BE GLAD TO SHARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE. OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE PLEASE SIR. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- AND AGAIN IT GOES TO THE THE CRUX OF THE AMOUNT OF OF PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVE. AND THE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE. AND RETENTION RATE. WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR KNEE WHAT IS YOUR CRITICAL NEED OF EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK? IN A LOT OF THE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAID THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AND WHAT'S THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE THERE'S SOME WERE WORRIED SAID. YOU HAD ONE WISH WHAT WOULD THAT NUMBER BE. IN ORDER FOR ME TO SATISFY EVERYBODY THAT'S ON A WAITING LIST OVER. TWENTY FIVE DAVE HELLO YOU. ARE NOT. OLD BUT IN PROBLEMS BOB. PEOPLE PROGRAM SERVICES HI. YOUR PROGRAM SERVICES ARE PUT FORTH BY YOUR STAFF THAT THAT IS YOUR PROGRAM -- THE PHILOSOPHY IS THERE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BEST PERSON THERE THE SAFEST PERSON THE MOST TRAIN PERCENT. BUT TO DO THAT AGAIN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO'S WHO IN CASES HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES SOMETIME VANCE DEGREES. WHO ARE LOOKING [INAUDIBLE] FOR VERY MUCH. AND IT'S HARD TO KEEP. RETAIN THEM SO THERE IS NO. THAT'S NOT WE'RE NOT FACING SO MUCH WHAT ARTISTS FEES. FACING THERE BUT WE DO HAVE TURNOVER RATES THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE IT HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS 30% TERMS OF DIRECT CARE PROFESSIONALS [INAUDIBLE] BUT ARE WE NOW KNOW I'D I I'D HAVE TO HONESTLY THAT WERE NOT BUT IT'S ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BUILD A CAREER TO MOVE FORWARD IN IN IN THE CHAIR SO TO SPEAK. AND TO BRING THEIR EXPERTISE AND THEN TRAIN THE NEW PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN MAKING -- WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT PLACES LIKE YOU SEE P. AND THE ARK? A LOT OF OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUT HERE TONIGHT THEIR CAREER THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMITTED IN. ONE SO WE HAVE TO GIVE ME A REASON TO STAY -- JUST A ABOUT IT. AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO RECRUIT IMPERIAL VALLEY. YOU HAVE A LIKE -- AN INSTITUTION AT LEAST IN TERMS OF PROVIDING. EDUCATED TRAIN POSTERS I THINK YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTERFERE VALLEY UP TO LEAVE THIS WITH YOU. DON'T HAVE TO SEE ISSUE OTHER THAN -- THERE'S STATE THERE'S A SATELLITE CAMPUS SO SEND IT WAS. WHICH BY THE WAY I TEACH THERE. YOU HAVE A AND I I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT'S IN THE SATELLITE CAMPUS I KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS A PART OF IT. SENATE BECAUSE THEY FOR YEARS BUT DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF THAT THAT COULD KIND OF BEAT YOU IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR AND WE DO. STUDENTS THAT -- INTERESTED SOME OF MY STUDENTS WHICH IS EXCITING -- BUT YEAH MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ONE OF WORK WITH US. IS JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IN THE SENATE I WANT TO TRY THIS. THERE'S NOT A WILL BE A CLEAR PATH [INAUDIBLE] EDUCATIONALLY WISE. WELL ARE TAKEN AND UNDERSTOOD YOU KNOW AND APPRECIATE WHAT YOU GUYS THERE'S A SPECIAL PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR YOU GUYS SWEAR TO GOD. THE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AND THE THE ACTUAL PROVIDERS. AND THE SERVICE OF THE EMPLOYERS. CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR HANGING IN THERE WITH US AND AND BELIEVING THAT. ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY IN SACRAMENTO TRYING. TO MOVE THE NEEDLE EVERY DAY AS YOU SAID THERE WERE STRIDES THIS YEAR. THERE WERE STRIDES AND I THINK THAT THERE IS. A A RENEWED FAITH THAT WE CAN GET THERE WITH THIS RATE STUDY KNOWING THAT. WE NEED ADVOCACY IN IN THE CAPITAL WE WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE NEED PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO. WISHING OTHER LEGISLATORS AND THE ADMINISTRATION [INAUDIBLE] EDUCATE. NOT USE A MOTION BUT ACTUAL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. TO EDUCATE. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VOTING. AND DETERMINING THE OUTCOMES OF THE EFFORT. SO LOOK FOR TO HEAR OF X. IN SACRAMENTO ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE WE HAVE THREE SELF ADVOCATES WHO ARE GOING TO TELL US.

STAFF AND DECENT MAN PROVIDERS NEED A RATE INCREASE EVEN MORE BUT YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT. AND YOUR HUNDRED AGAIN TONIGHT. SO WHAT IS KIND NEED. AND WHAT DO THOUSANDS WITH NO ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES NEED. AS THREE BULLETS. I BELIEVE THEY NEED YOUR HELP. TO ENSURE THE MONEY FROM THE CLOSURES OF VALEMOUNT CENTERS. REMAINS AND A DEDICATED HOUSING FUND. TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED COMMUNITY HOUSING. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL. AND IT WOULD BE VERY VERY NOT OKAY. TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO GENERAL FUND THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION. DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE SITTING ON PRIME PROPERTY IS WORTH EIGHT TONS OF MONEY. THOSE MUST REMAIN IN A DEDICATED HOUSING. AND I THINK YOU CAN I ABOUT MARCUS. WHAT ELSE IS NEEDED? THE OPTION TO CONTROL SERVICE DOLLARS THROUGH SELF DETERMINATION. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES MUST BE GIVEN THE TOOLS THAT. YOUR PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD A CHOICE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SOMEBODY COMES UP AND SAYS SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO. YEAH I DON'T KNOW YEAH. ARE. SO THAT TOOLS MUST BE THERE. AND IT HAS TO BEGIN TO SHARE. AND I'M NOT WITH PILOT THEN WE HAD MORE PILOTS WE HAD A PILOT SEVEN YEARS AGO NOW IN ANOTHER PART OF SELF DETERMINATION YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH. WE NEED MORE. LAST WHAT ELSE DO PEOPLE MADE I THINK THE FATE AND COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. HOW LONG Ó LORD [INAUDIBLE] AMEN [INAUDIBLE] AMEN. WHAT WE KNOW? WE KNOW THROUGH DEIRA THAT 13% OF CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. ARE APPLIED COMPARED 275% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT. 13%. OF CALIFORNIAN OF INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE EMPLOYED. COMPARED 275%. OF THE GENERAL POPULATION SHOP. LAPSED WE NEED TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS IT'S YOUNG. THE ORIGINAL CENTERS MISSION YET. WE NEED TO NOT JUST TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT A LONG TIME. DISABILITY RIGHTS ARE CIVIL RIGHTS. ARE YOUR FAVORITES HERE WOULD TELL YOU HE'S HAPPY. ANY AS DRONES JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. HI DOESN'T NEED A HANDOUT. HE NEEDS A HAND UP. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE MADE MUCH PROGRESS BUT I'M THRILLED. BUT THERE REMAINS MUCH. ZERO WE NEED TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS AND EQUALITY FOR PEOPLE OF AN ELECTION IN THE RUBBLE MODES OF THE USER REALIZED AND TOGETHER. WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE ARE MAKING IT HAPPEN.

AND SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN A WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM AND HAVE NOTHING THEY HAVE. NOTHING TO DO THEY HAVE NO FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY'RE JUST AS PASSIONATE AS WE ARE ABOUT SERVING. THE COMMUNITY AND I JUST THINK THAT IT REALLY BLOWS ME AWAY -- MY NAME'S TERRY CLUTCHES THEY SAID AND I USUALLY DON'T LIKE A SCRIPT THAT ON I TEND TO TALK A LOT IN CURLESS ENCOURAGED ME. TO TYPE IT OUT SO. I DON'T I WANT TO GET THE HOOK FROM YOU GUYS EVERYTHING HER. SO. I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S TWENTY YEARS OLD SHE SEVERELY IMPACTED WITH AUTISM SHE'S NONVERBAL SO SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT. IT'S VERY HARD TO SERVE ON ONE OF THE LEAD CARLOS TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATED RATE HOMES THAT'S THAT'S HER. AND A LOT OF TIMES. YOU GUYS ON HERE ABOUT THAT PART OF THE POPULATION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE. TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES AT ALL AND I CAN EVEN BRING HER HERE I COULD BUT YOU BE THROWING MONEY JUST. TO HAVE A SLEEVE. BUT THE REGIONAL CENTER -- IS SERVING HER SINCE SHE WAS EIGHT MONTHS OLD -- HAVE TO SAY THAT. THE TWO WERE INSTRUMENTAL AND BEING THERE FOR OUR FAMILY AND FOR HER WHEN WE REALLY NEED THE HELP I MEAN. THAT REALLY SERVER YOU'RE FALLING APART REGIONAL CENTERS THERE AND THEY'RE ACES THEY THEIR PEOPLE THERE ARE GREAT -- I HAD SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH -- EVERYBODY THAT I CAME IN CONTACT WITH WILSON GREAT CASE WORKER. AND SO I JUST DECIDED. YOU KNOW IT I'M SO HAPPY WITH. THE SERVICES I WOULD JOIN THE BOARD SO I GOT ON THE BOARD IN -- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HE SERVED AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD THERE -- I WAS ON THE BOARD ARE GAS OR WITH SUSPICION A REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES -- FOR FIVE YEARS AND SERVED AS A PRESIDENT THERE. AS I A LOT OF WORK EXPERIENCE IN ADDITION TO THAT AND I AM TO TELL YOU THAT -- IN ALL THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ON FOR ITS -- THERE'S NO. BETTER MORE THAN SAY REGIONAL CENTER NO BETTER ORGANIZATION AND I CAN SEE THAT THE STATE LEVEL VERY EDUCATION LEVEL OF KNOWING ALL THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE WAY THEY'RE RUN. UNTIL YOU SAN DIEGO IS. IN MY OPINION THE BEST ONE THE STATE I THINK WE MAYES IN BOARD THE WORD REALLY WORKS WELL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE YOU KNOW REALLY TRY TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS ENTREE B. GENERATIVE COME UP WITH. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS -- I THINK OF HOLDING LANTERN ACT IS IS REALLY SO CRITICAL AS A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE SAID BEFORE ME -- IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR CLIENTS FOR THEIR SAFETY OTHER SECURITY THEIR HAPPINESS AND INTEGRATION BETWEEN A. S. ALSO CRITICAL FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR SYSTEM. AND FOR OUR CLIENTS. HER SON MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS OUT THERE -- WE'RE HERE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN OUR COMMITMENT IS STEADFAST BUT WE YOU KNOW THEY THEY REALLY NEED US NAY IS TO PUSH IT. ON THE ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE -- AND I'M GONNA ECHO IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN LAST BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S EVERY SENSE THING BUT I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THOSE CRITICAL.

WELL I JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING AND THANK YOU TERRY FOR MENTIONING WHEN YOUR LAST THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY -- I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE I'M SURE ARE REALLY HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME HERE. TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS AND SENTIMENTS IS MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU. I'M JUST TO TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS AND I DON'T WANT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE. WHAT? I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE RAID ISSUE IS NOT SELF SERVING. PROVIDERS ARE NOT COMING HERE SAYING GIVE US MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENRICH OURSELVES. IS KIM POINTED OUT IT REALLY AFFECTS THE QUALITY. SO IF YOU CAN'T HAVE QUALITY SERVICES. IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING -- YOU KNOW SELF DETERMINATION MIGHT BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE OF PEOPLE CAN HIRE THEIR OWN STAFF. DOES SHE NEED A PAY SCALE. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET AWAY WITH SPENDING LESS. ON CONSISTENT HELP THAT AS AND POINTED OUT HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT HAVE ACHIEVED HER OBJECTIVES HAD SHE HAD CONSISTENT -- SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. SO YAY FOR SELF DETERMINATION. AND THE ROLLOUT IS JUST UNDERWAY HERE WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM OF PEOPLE. AND I DO WANT TO MENTION I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE IS HERE BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY IS VERY COHESIVE -- WE MIGHT NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME AND I'M KEY POINTS PEOPLE REALLY DO COME TOGETHER. AND CURLESS MENTIONED HOW THEY SUPPORT VARIOUS EVENTS AND THE TRULY DO SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTNERS EVERY AGENCY DOES WHAT THEY CAN'T. WE'RE VERY SMALL AGENCY SO WE REALLY COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH NEARLY ANYTHING WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO PLEASE THE WAGE ISSUE AS YOU KNOW GOTTA BE ADDRESS SOMEHOW. THE RACE FOR PROVIDERS ARE JUST I USED TO BE A PROVIDER. AND I WAS A PROVIDER FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS I WAS A SPECIAL ED TEACHER PRIOR TO THAT. SO I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF AREAS AFFECTING OUR POPULATION. I'M EMPLOYMENT IS HUGE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY NOW WHICH I HOPE EVERYONE SUPPORTS AND KNOWS ABOUT -- BASICALLY IT'S SAYING THAT. OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. IS THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THE TRANSITION PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL. AND WE REALLY NEED TO EMBRACE THAT IN OFFER VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES AND INTERNSHIPS THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT CAME OUT OF THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY. HOPEFULLY WILL ENCOURAGE MORE EMPLOYERS -- TO EXPERIENCE HIRING SOMEONE WITH AN INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY -- ATTITUDES ARE STILL NOT WITH THE SHOULD BE. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT BY EXPOSURE BY REALLY GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE [INAUDIBLE] I'M. THERE'S OTHER PATHWAYS TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. AND CHARLIE MENTIONED HE WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE. I'M NINE YEARS AGO WE STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT COLLEGE. WHICH IS A GROUP OF IT IT STEMS FROM A TRANSITION COMMITTEE WE HOSTED AT OUR OFFICE. AND ONE PARENT HAD A SON WHO WAS STRUGGLING IN A SECONDARY EDUCATION. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASE IN STUDENTS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM MANY OF THESE STUDENTS ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF GOING TO A CREDENTIALED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY. ON THE DID LIKE SOME OF INTERPERSONAL SKILLS IDENTITY SKILLS THINGS OF THAT NATURE THE ABILITY TO GO AND SEEK OUT THE HELP THEY NEEDED. SO WE PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL COLLEGE. AND WE RUN A ONE WEEK -- COLLEGE LIVING EXPERIENCE WERE STUDENTS GET TO LIVE IN THE DORMS THEY HAVE A MEAL CURRENTLY TAKE ACTUAL COLLEGE CLASSES. AND WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD SUCCESS IT'S VERY SMALL. NOT TRYING TO BLOW IT OUT OF PROPORTION WE ONLY TAKE TWELVE STUDENTS. BUT IT'S IT'S A START AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THE SCHOOL. IS UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO IS WHO WE PARTNER WITH ADOPT THIS IS A REGULAR OFFERING THEY HAVE EVAN PROGRAMS EVERY YEAR FOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHY NOT HAVE THIS -- SO THAT'S JUST A SUGGESTION -- OUR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. WE HAVE A HUGE EVENT LOCALLY THAT'S A COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE OF ALL TYPES OF DISABILITIES. PEOPLE THAT ARE BLIND PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAF PEOPLE THAT ARE WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHAB PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M THIS YEAR EARLY HAN HAS DONATED CHANGE ARENA FOR THIS EVENT SO CLEARLY THERE IS -- SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S AN AWESOME EVENT HOUSING YEAH TO OTHER FOUNDATION AND CARLOS FOR HAVING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING COLLABORATIVE. BUT AS YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A SMALL BITE. BECAUSE I PULLED THE STATISTICS YESTERDAY FROM THE NATIONAL LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION. AND IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE AFFORDABLE RENT FOR AN SSI RECIPIENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS. FOR A PERSON WITH A FULL TIME JOB PAYING MINIMUM WAGE WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. I'M I DON'T KNOW WHERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU COULD FIND THAT HOUSING [INAUDIBLE] SO IT'S CRITICAL TO INCENTIVIZE LANDLORDS PERHAPS. HOUSING DEVELOPERS THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME. SOME GIVE SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IT'S TWELVE YEAR WAIT LISTS FOR SECTION EIGHT HOUSING AND EVEN THEN IF YOU GET A VOUCHER TRY TO FIND A LANDLORDS WILLING TO ACCEPT IT. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS ALL THAT WE TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF THEY ASK FOR ADVICE SAY GET ON THE WAITING LIST NOW GET ON THE WAITING LIST WHEN YOU'RE. EIGHTEEN OTHER NOT READY TO MOVE. ALRIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO BE GETTING IT TOMORROW. MAYBE BY THE TIME THEY'RE THIRTY THEY'LL GET A AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO IT'S A STRUGGLE -- WE DO THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATOR SURVEY SO WE GET FEEDBACK FROM AREAS AGE RANGES DEPENDING ON THE YEAR. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING. AND INDIVIDUALS -- PROVIDE FIRST HAND INFORMATION. THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE REALLY. EASY THEY THEY HAVE SO MUCH ON THEIR PLATES SOMETIMES GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED IS NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. SO. SOMEHOW IF THERE COULD BE SOME. DATABASE SOMEWHERE OF OF INFORMATION I KNOW THERE'S MANY BUT TO REALLY STREAMLINE IT AND GET IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE FOLKS WHO STRUGGLE AND SAY I NEVER KNEW. YOU ASKED ME THIS QUESTION JUST MY CHILD GET. A RESPITE SERVICES I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD ASK FOR IT. THAT'S A PROBLEM. SO SOMEHOW WE NEED TO REALLY PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION -- AND WHAT ELSE DID I WANNA TALK THAT PROBABLY NOTHING I SHOULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN APPEARANCES DITTO TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY SAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S IT'S AN AWESOME COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE. TRY PEOPLE STRUGGLE OF THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES. AND YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF STAFF WE'RE LOSING GOOD PEOPLE. SO THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR SYSTEM SO STRONG. PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME AGENCY THEY MIGHT GO TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY THEY TAKE ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BUILD THAT. AND PROFESSIONAL LINES. THIS IS A CAREER PATH. YOU KNOW MANY MANY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO ARE A PROVIDERS IN THIS FIELD THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS ARE NOT LOOKING TO JOIN THE WORK FORCE. THEY MAY DO VOLUNTEER WORK GENERAL. EXCUSE ME BEEN FORCED TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK. AS WE DRAG THE WITH US BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE A JOB IT'S NOT GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE [INAUDIBLE] SOME. THAT'S ABOUT IT -- AND I DID WANT TO SAY -- PEOPLE FIRST NAY HIM THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT. REALLY -- EMPOWERING PEOPLE. IS CRITICAL THOSE SELF ADVOCATES IN FAMILY ADVOCATES TO SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES AND TO DIRECT HOW THEIR SERVICES ARE GOING. AND I THINK YOU CAN TELL FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SPOKEN. I THINK PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE SAYING WHAT THEY WANT AND KNOW THEY MAY NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT ALWAYS BUT THEY KNOW THEY CAN ASKING YOU NEGOTIATES LIKE ANYTHING ELSE. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL LET YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE. JUST SECOND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. SO I YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA THANK YOU MARYLAND FOR BEING HERE AND YOUR PASSION AND COMPASSION. FOR ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND WE BOTH. ABSOLUTELY ADORE -- RESONATES AGAIN THE THE COMPLETE NEED. I WAS AN EMPLOYER I CALL USE AN EMPLOYER WE UNDERSTAND RETENTION AND AND PAYING DECENT AND GOOD WAGES. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THROUGH THE HEARINGS THAT I'VE HAD IS WORRIED KNOWLEDGE IN THE FACT THAT WE NEED TRAINED INDIVIDUAL. IT MAKE A DECENT WAGE SO THEY CAN. HAVE A CAREER PATH. BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT WE INVEST IN THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY CARE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE CARE ABOUT. ON A LEVEL ON THAT SAME LEVEL. AND SO THERE'S A GIVEN TAKE GOING THERE. SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT LEGISLATION IN THE UPCOMING YEAR THE CREE CREE PASS IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS GOING FORWARD. IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE AN 83% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AND SO UNDERSTANDING. PEOPLE ARE MAKING TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THEY WILL COME BACK DOWN. TO MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE PAYS MORE AND SO. WE HAVE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AT A LACK. OF HAVING EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IT. IS CAN'T COMPETE. YOU KNOW THERE USED TO BE A PROGRAMMER CAN SEE THE AREA THAT STARTED TO GROSSMONT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND WENT THROUGH IDEALLY TO A PHD. AND WE HAVE HIRED ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO IS IN FACT NOW PHD. AND SHE'S AN INCLUSION SPECIALIST IN THE SCHOOL THIS. SO IT DOES WORK. IF YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU MY DAUGHTER WAS AN UNDERGRAD AT UC DAVIS. AND SPENT TWO YEARS A TURNING POINT IN SACRAMENTO WORKING WITH THE ID POPULATION THEN CAME. SAN DIEGO FOR HER MASTERS IN AN INSIDE D. SHE'S AT SHARP MEMORIAL HOSPITAL DOING CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. BUT WHEN SHE CAME TO SAN DIEGO I'VE NEVER HAD HER BACK. IS THERE WHERE YOU REALLY HERE. JUST SHARING WITH SHE LOVES YOU COMMUNITY BUT SHE ALSO IS IS IS. ABOUT THE THE POPULATION WHEN SHE WORKED WITH THEM FOR TWO YEARS SHE TO I WAS SO AFRAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE. BUT SHE DID IN AND BUT WE WILL NOT [INAUDIBLE] YEAH VÀ. WE WILL NOT GIVE UP. GOOD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE'RE HERE PUBLIC COMMONS. THIS IS WHERE WE HEAR FROM YOU. SO COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE WILL START A LINE RIGHT HERE. OF IF YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR STORY TELL US YOUR NAME. AND PLEASE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND ENSURING EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK. YOU LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES. WHAT I WILL DO IS AFTER AFTER AT IF WE STOP YOU TWO MINUTES WHEN WE HAVE TIME LEFT OVER? YOU CAN COME BACK UP TO THE MIKE AND FINISH UP. WE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM SIR. HEY. BOB GUTHRIE I'M FROM A EACH COUNTY FROM EL CAJON. AND I'M ALSO I SERVE ON DE. PEOPLE'S FIRST WHAT THE ERROR YOU BOARD THIRTEEN WENT -- JIM WALKER NOR PARKER. AND I I'VE BEEN WITH THE I WAS WITH THE ARC FOR YEARS. FOR SO MANY YEARS. AND THEN THEY PLACED ME ON A REGULAR JOB FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I WORKED THERE FOR AT A AT A COMPANY NAMED GEORGE TECH AND APPROACH THAT THE SHOCK COMPANY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I HAD A GOOD JOB COACH THROUGH OUR REGIONAL CENTER HAS BEEN MY PROVIDER. EVEN WHEN I WAS CAME OUT FROM THE INSTITUTION IN. NINETEEN FIFTY THREE TO FIFTY NINE I WAS AT BORDER BILL STATE HOSPITAL -- VICHY HOSPITAL WORD OF ONE THAT THEY WANT TO SELL. AND THEN THEY ALSO HAD CINEMA. ORVILLE IS BECAME A LIKE A IT WAS LIKE PATTON. AND THEN I GOT SEVERAL OTHER STATE HOSPITALS AROUND AS THAT'S MOSTLY A QUOTA OF LIKE -- I KNOW THEY GOT THE TASK A GIRL TO JUMP IN HERE. GEN A BARBER AREA. AND MOST OF THOSE PLACES THAT I'VE. YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF THOSE PLACES WHEN GOVERNOR PAT BROWN. BEFORE JERRY BROWN EVEN COULD BE BECAME GOVERNOR AND EVEN BEFORE RONALD REAGAN. AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. TO BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT OUR PEOPLE. IN OTHER PEOPLE. DATA SHOULD PROVIDE SERVICES FOR US BECAUSE I'M WITH THE TAYLOR PROGRAM I GOT A PERSON NAMED. MERYL DESERVE REAL GOOD WORKERS ARE [INAUDIBLE] RATE WORKER. CARLOS IS A GREAT. CAR OWNERS A GREAT -- YOU KNOW WITH REGIONAL CENTER AND IN DEVRY MARSHALL WITH PEOPLE. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS EVENING THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT. STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENTING AWAY FROM HELLO MY NAME IS LUCILLE LYNCH AND I'M A PARENT OF TWO INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. AND I'M ALSO A FOUNDER OF BEACONS NORTH COUNTY OR BEACON ZINC IN CARLSBAD. AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT US TO THINK BEYOND STANDING A REGIONAL CENTER A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN AS DO THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO TRYING TO CREATE SKILLS. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK TO LOOK AT THE AD CODE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT OUR DISTRICTS HAVE EIGHT YEARS HIGH SCHOOL AND ADULT TRANSITION PROGRAMS TO EQUIP PEOPLE WITH SKILLS TO GET A JOB. AND FOR SOME REASON THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. SO I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER POSSIBLY LOOKING INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE EDUCATION. FOR PEOPLE DIPLOMA BOUND THEY HAVE THIRTEEN COURSES THEY BASICALLY ARE YOU SENSUALLY AND EDUCATIONAL GUARANTEES. OF ACCESS TO LANGUAGE FINE ARTS AND SO FORTH TO GET THAT DIPLOMA. IF YOU ARE NOT DIPLOMA BOUND THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE EDUCATIONAL COURSE DEGREE UNDER THE CODE AND I FEEL THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE FUNDS AND THE SUPPORT IN THE STAFF ROOM PLACE TO BE DOING MAGICAL THINGS. BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE AND WHICH YOU KNOW THEY TO BE PROGRAM OR OTHER PROGRAMS THERE ARE NO COURSES ARE NO CURRICULUM AND THE OUTCOMES OF REMAINED ALMOST STAGNANT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. SO I WOULD LIKE FOR THE ASSEMBLY TO CONSIDER POSSIBLY HAVING COURSES REQUIRED FOR NON DIPLOMA STUDENTS OR TO HAVE A HYBRID OF YOUR DIPLOMA DOWN BUT NEED SUPPORT. THAT INCLUDE COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY SOCIAL AND SOFT SKILLS SELF ADVOCACY VOCATIONAL EXPLORATION SEX EDUCATION PROBLEM SOLVING AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE GRADUATING FROM THESE PROGRAMS EQUIPPED TO TRANSITION I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS WERE MAKING THAT'S NOT IN PLACE. AND BY DOING THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY REDUCE THE CASELOAD FOR IT PIECE TEACHERS ARE DOING GREAT JOBS BUT AGAIN WE KEEP HEARING HOW THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TIME RESOURCES. IF YOU HAVE THE STRUCTURE CLASSES PEOPLE COULD LEARN COLLABORATIVELY AND REDUCE THE DEMAND ON THAT ARE YOU P. PROCESS WHICH SOMETIMES DIVIDES TEACHERS AND PARENTS. I ALSO THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE EL CAP FUNDING. THEY'LL CUT FUNDING GIVES SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ANOTHER FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS WHO NEED EXTRA HELP AND THAT HAVE BARRIERS WHAT'S HAPPENING KNOWS NON DIPLOMA STUDENTS. ARE NOT HAVING HIS EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES SO MIGHT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING TIMES SOME OF THAT EL CAP FUNDING TO EITHER INCREASING DEPLOYMENT DOWN STUDENTS FROM THE NON DIPLOMA TRACKS OR DID T&LT;C.CYAN&GT; THAT SOMEHOW&LT;/C&GT; WITH EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. OKAY I'M SORRY -- AND ALSO THERE'S A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS BUT I WILL WRITE YOU AND LET YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU HAVE TIME AND LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU. I ALSO JUST THEM AND THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS DANNY ANDERSON I HAVE WILLIAMS SYNDROME -- I THINK A LOT OF US SUFFER FROM MONEY. AND I THINK A LOT OF I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. SUFFER BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE FOR ME. I LIVE IN AND SUPPORTED LIVING NOW I USED TO LIVE WITH MY MOM. I WAS GETTING MORE MONEY THAN THAN I WAS IN SUPPORT OF LIVING. I MAKE THREE NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT DOES NOT HELP ME WITH THE STUFF THAT I NEED. AND IT DOES NOT HELP ME WITH WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I NEED LIKE MY HYGIENE PRODUCTS. MY MY THOUGHT THAT I NEED. AND I'M SUFFERING. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY AND WITH ME SPECIAL WITH ME BEING WILL HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. I CAN'T GET A JOB. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. BUT I'VE TRIED TO LOOK FOR JOBS AND NO ONE WILL HIRE ME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DIPLOMA PLUS. I PLUS I HAVE A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION. THAT DOESN'T HELP ME EITHER SO. I AM ASKING YOU GUYS IF YOU GUYS CAN FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION. TO HELP US TO GET MORE MONEY THAN WE THAN WE NEED. BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THE COMMUNITY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. SO I'M SPEAKING FOR EVERYBODY THAT IS HOMELESS AND EVERYTHING. IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE IT IN MY EYES [INAUDIBLE] THAT [INAUDIBLE] I I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HOMELESS BECAUSE BECAUSE THE RIGHT AND EVERYTHING IS SO HIGH. I WISH THERE WAS A PLACE WHERE. WHERE ALL OF US CAN LIVE WHERE THERE'S NOT LIKE? IT'S NOT GOING TO BE RAISING RENT OR LOWERING RENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANYTHING THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. SO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS A SOLUTION THAT YOU GUYS CAN DO. BECAUSE I PAY SEVEN HUNDRED A MONTH. THE OTHER THE OTHER APARTMENT BECAUSE THEY MOVED FROM. I MOVE FROM TWO DIFFERENT APARTMENTS AND I THINK IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS CAN. FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR SPECIAL NEEDS. WHO LIVE IS AN APARTMENT COMPLEX? WHO LIVES AND? INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH THE SUPPORT OF LIVING. WONDERING IF. THERE'S A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GO THAT'S NOT [INAUDIBLE] SO HIGH. WE WE DO WE DO WE ARE YOU. AND SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE CARLOS HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU. AND MAKE THAT. HE'S LEARNING YES I APPRECIATE THE GIRLS.

HIS COMPRESSION -- ANOTHER. HEY IF YOU DON'T CONTINUITIES HOME HORTON. HER POPULATION REALLY IMPORTANT -- OF AN ECLECTIC DIMENSION I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD THE CORPORATION AROUND TO REGIONAL CENTER HERE SO. THESE ARE MY COMMENTS PERSONALLY THOUGH MOPPING UP THE BOARD -- JUST TWO ITEMS I'D REALLY LIKE TO FOCUS ON ONE IS -- AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT A POPULAR ITEM BUT SOME. FOLKS CANNOT COMPETE. IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT OKAY AND IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HAVE A JOB TRAINING SKILLS IN DAY PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THERE IS INTENSE COMPETITION FOR THE VOLUNTEER JOBS. AND YOU KNOW. WE WERE TOLD YEAH SHE COULD DO A JOB OVER HERE BUT IT WOULD TAKE TWO HOURS EACH WAY. ON A BUS TO GET THERE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO. WHEN SHE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL IN IN TRANSITION SHE GOT A WORKABILITY PROGRAM SHE COULD WORK FOR A LOCAL RESTAURANT? IN GET. YOU KNOW AND AND GET THE EXPERIENCE NOW SHE CAN'T. I WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT TO CONTINUE AT SOME LEVEL FOR FOLKS IN -- THE THE THE OTHER THING IS JUST IF WE COULD BRING BACK SOME FUNDING FOR CAMPS AND RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE OUR POPULATION IS NOT HAVING. A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO SOCIALIZE. RIGHT IT WITH HIM OTHER THAN MAYBE WITHIN A VERY SMALL FAMILY GROUPS OR WORK GROUP AND LITTLE AMOUNTS CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO MY NAME IS SONORA PARKER AND I SEVEN PEOPLE'S FIRST AS A SECRETARY WITH THE MARSHAL'S. OFFICE AND I WOULD LIKE IT IS CASACORNELIA MEDIUM ILIFE. THEN I'M A PART OF HER HIGH -- LET'S SEE AGENCY. WHICH IS CALLED LIVING PURPOSE. ALL THE BOOKS REGIONAL PLEASE. YOU THE CONTINGENT. I WORKERS THREE MONTHS. BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY. SO I HAVE ON THE BOOKS. EVERY JOKE AND PAY FOR AYE OVER SERVICES. WHAT IBM? BUT THE ONLY PERSON I GET IS THE OWNER. IS THE LET YOU KNOW THAT THEY NEED. TO INCREASE YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE SERVICES ON THE BOOKS. NEVER REACH THE PEOPLE. BECAUSE I'M ONE OF BECAUSE OUR PROGRAM YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ONE OF THE AYE. COOL GET PAID FOR DOING. I'M BEEN WAITING FOR ONE MONTH. THE DESTRUCTION OF CLEANING DOWN OR STEP. HI HI MY NAME IS TERRA BILO I'M ATTACHING SPECIALIST FOR ACT INDEPENDENT LIVING SUPPORTED LIVING AND RESPITE SERVICES. AND I HAVE A QUICK COMMENT TO MAKE ON BUT MR HER SHE AND MR CENTERS OF BEFORE -- TWENTY SOME YEARS AGO I WAS A GROUP HOME COORDINATOR -- FOR AN ARC GROUP HOME. AND WE HAD FOR ABOUT A YEAR. A SOLID STAFF BASS SAME PEOPLE EVERY SHIFT EVERY DAY. AND THE PROGRESS WE SAW WITH THE PEOPLE LIVE I MEAN THAT'S THEIR HOME AND TO HOW STRANGERS COMING IN AND OUT EVERY DAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE PROGRESS AND THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO LEARN AND DO. WHEN WE HAVE THAT STABLE STAFF THERE? PEOPLE CAME OUT OF THERE SO WE WOULD SIT IN THE LIVING ROOM TO WATCH TV IT FELT LIKE A HOME. AND SO THAT SO SORELY NEEDED THESE DAYS THE TURNOVER IS RIDICULOUS -- AS A PARENT A SPECIALIST ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO TOUCH ON KIND OF GOES TO THE GROUP WOMAN HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE BUT I HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS PROBABLY MOSTLY SINGLE PARENTS THAT -- HAVE. IDC BUT ALSO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE HOME. AND SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVE DISABILITIES AND SOME DON'T AND SO WE GO IN THE HOME WANTING TO MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN ARE ON TRACK DEVELOPMENTALLY AND HAVE WHAT THEY NEED BUT A LOT OF TIMES. IF THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR HOUSING OR HAVE A PLACE TO GO THERE'S NO GROUP HOME THAT WILL IT TAKE SINGLE PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHERE WE CAN GO AND WORK WITH. OUR HAVE SUPPORTED LIVING FOR THEM SO THAT'S A BIG CRISIS WHERE THEY KIND OF FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AS FAR AS WHERE WE CAN GET THEM HOUSING BECAUSE HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU. DON'T HAVE SSI OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU DON'T MAKE THREE TIMES IN A MONTH WHAT YOUR RENT WOULD BE NOBODY WILL GIVE YOU AN APART SAID SO THERE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE IN A LOT OF THEM ARE ON THE STREETS. FOR IMMINENTLY GOING TO BE THERE. BUT THEY NEED SERVICES IN A PLACE. TO LIVE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WHERE THEY CAN SERVICE THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS STACY EMERSON AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO HAS -- INTELLECTUAL. DISABILITIES SHE WAS ADOPTED SHE WAS EXPOSED PRIMARILY TO ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. AND SHE SUFFERED TRAUMA AND I AM I'M REALLY JEALOUS OF SAN DIEGO'S REGIONAL. I'LL TELL YOU THAT I AM BECAUSE OURS IS NOT THAT GREAT -- I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW GROUP HOMES ARE UNDER FUNDED AND REGIONAL CENTERS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NEED FOR THAT TO BUT THERE ARE A LARGE ARM COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THE DOCTOR ADOPTIVE AND FOSTER CARE COMMUNITY. THAT DON'T BELONG IN THOSE IF THEY WOULD JUST GET THE PROPER TREATMENT EARLY ON AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING BACK. ON MY DAUGHTER IS ONE OF THOSE KIDS THOSE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS SHE HAS. VERY EXPLOSIVE AND DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR I'D GO TO MENTAL HEALTH THE TIME WE GOT TO THE REGIONAL CENTER I GO TO THE REGIONAL CENTER THEY PROVIDE AB. EIGHT ABA DOES NOT HELP CHILDREN WHO HAS SEVERELY DISTURBED BEHAVIORS YOU JUST DON'T. SO I MUST NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO SHE HAS BEEN IN A GROUP HOME. I'VE TAKEN ROUTE EVERY PROGRESS THAT I HAVE NEED FOR HER HAS BEEN ON MY OWN MY OWN RESEARCH MY OWN. THINKING OF MY OWN MONEY MY OWN TIME I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY HELP FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER EXCEPT A LITTLE BIT OF RESPITE. WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH IN ADDITION TO THAT THE REST OF IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE IT TO FIND A PROVIDER WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT ME TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. AND THEY'RE GETTING PAID A LITTLE TINY BIT OF MONEY YOU CAN'T REALLY FIND SOMEBODY. TO DO THAT YEAH I CANNOT FIND A RESPITE PROVIDER I NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP ME FIND THAT PERSON I NEED THE REGIONAL CENTER TO DO THAT. IF MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT PROVIDE SERVICES FOR MY DAUGHTER IN THE SWITCH REGIONAL CENTER I NEED YOU GUYS TO HELP ME FIND PROVIDERS THAT WILL PROVIDE SERVICES FOR HER. BECAUSE OTHERWISE SHE'S GONNA END UP IN A REGIONAL CENTER SHE'S GONNA END UP COMING HOME SHE I MEAN IN A TREATMENT CENTER TO GIVE IN THE COMING HOME NOT BETTER SHE'S GOING TO END UP IN A GROUP HOME. SHE MAY END UP HOMELESS AND ON DRUG. AND THOSE THAT'S A LARGE POPULATION. IN THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED. SO WE DO HAVE THE STAFF MEMBER FROM DDS HERE TONIGHT ALSO. WILL. OKAY UP WITHOUT AND ALSO -- BUT REGIONAL CERTAIN USING. FRESNO COUNTY OKAY. SO WE DIDN'T DO HEARING UP FRESNO AT LAST YEAR BUT I DON'T I WASN'T AWARE OF IT AND THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD NUMEROUS TIMES. ABOUT SERVICES THROUGH THE SUPPORT GROUPS THAT I'M ON THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD BE PROVIDING THAT THE REGIONAL FOR HAS NEVER PROVIDED ME THEY DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT RESPITE. THEY DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT. I MEAN MOST OF THE SERVICES THAT I GET I HAVE HAD TO REQUEST FROM MY OWN. WE'LL WORK WITH YOU OKAY CAM KßT -- MICHAEL'S MY WIFE BONTA MULLIN. AND WE HAVE A THREE SIX REAL DAUGHTER. THAT -- IS THE JOY OF OUR LIVES AND A LOT OF THE CHILDREN THAT. OTHER PEOPLE DESCRIBE THERE IMPROVE. THE SAME GENE POOL I THINK -- SHE'S WONDERFUL. AND SHE'S BEEN LIVING AND A GROUP HOLD DOWN YOUR HOMES IN SPRING VALLEY. OFFER LAST FIVE YEARS IN THE FIVE YEARS SHE'S AWESOME. AND I CANNOT. PRAISE THEM ENOUGH FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. BUT THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP. A CONSISTENT. OUR STAFF TOGETHER. AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE PRESENTERS TO LIVE. WITH THE PROVIDERS. THAT IS THE MOST CRUCIAL THING IN. IN THEIR LIVES ARE. NOBODY CAN REALLY. TALK FOR THEM OR THEY CAN'T TALK FOR THEMSELVES A LOT OF THEM. HERE. EXPRESS THEIR NEEDS AND DESIRES AND TO GET A NEW PERSON. ALL THE TIME IT'S JUST LIKE STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN LIKE GOING INTO THE CLASSROOM YOU GOT A NEW TEACHER. OR WORSE YET A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. AND SO [INAUDIBLE] I JUST. WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR WHOLEHEARTED AGREEMENT. THAT [INAUDIBLE] MONIES. IF IT'S NOT ON THE SHORT LIST OF BUDGET ITEMS IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THEIR SHORTLIST. TO PROVIDE MONEY SO THAT THESE AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE QUALITY GOOD HEALTH. AND HAVE A STABILITY WITHIN THEIR STAFF. TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF CARE THAT THEY'RE DEDICATED TO PROVIDE. AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BLOSSOMING [INAUDIBLE] NO IDEA. WE BOTH SAID THE SAN DIEGANS AND WE HAVE OUR DAUGHTER WAS FROM BIRTH I MEAN. AND SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE SWEET WATER SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALL OF PRINTING TRANSITION EVERYTHING AND THEN SHE GOT TO BE TWENTY ONE TRANSITION WAS OVER. NADA. NOTHING. OCTOBER. I'M SO LIKELY SHE HAD US. AND SO BUT THEN WE STARTED GETTING OLDER. AND THE TWO THIRDS SPENDING MORE TIME IN HER ROOM JUST. READING MAGAZINES OR DOING WHATEVER AND HE STARTED GETTING WAY AND WE WILL AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN OUR OUR OLDER SON WITH THINK IF YOU HAVE A WIFE AND CHILD SO THING. THOSE ARE LOOKING TO START LOOKING IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS. OF TO START LOOKING AND AND THEN -- READ. THROUGH A FRIEND WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT NO HOMES AND IT WAS A TWO YEAR WAITING LIST. WE PUT OUR NAME ON IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN. SB BUT I BELIEVE THE LORD ALONE PROVIDE. IN THE LOWER PROVIDED THIS THING AND NOW AND SHIA. SHE LOVES HER ROOM SHE HAS HER OWN ROOM. BUT THE THING IS SHE HAVE SHE WORKS AT THE ARGUE YOU'LL CALL HOLD. SHE LOVES WORKING WITH KATHLEEN SO SHE'S WORKING WITH THAT IN THE MALL AND HE SHE'S TALKING YESTERDAY SHE GOT ME. TEN MINUTES ON THE PHONE TELLING ME WHEN SHE DOES THAT THEY THAT THEY THAT NEVER HAPPENED AND THE THING IS A SPORTS. SHE THE SPORT IS KING A SWITCH APART I MEAN. BASKETBALL TEAM EVEN THOUGH A BASKETBALL WAS UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF A SUDDEN SHE'S THROWING SHE'S REALLY FINISHING UP TO THE INTERNET AND THEN IF YOU STILL. DON'T DO SO WELL SHE TOOK. AND WHILE SHE GETS LIKE THAT YES WE SHOULD. YEAH I HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO TELL BUT SPORTS IN. AND OF ARTS IN THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE MENTIONED BEFORE BUT THAT'S REALLY CRUCIAL BUT IT'S WITH OUR LOW HI MY NAME IS JAMIE SHACKLE FORD IN HERE TONIGHT WITH THE YMCA CHILD CARE RESOURCE SERVICE SPECIFICALLY TEENS EMOTION. WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT SERVES TWELVE TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLDS ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS CURRENTLY WE SERVE SEVENTY STUDENTS AND WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO CLOSE ONE OF OUR SITES IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DUE. TO FINANCIAL ON SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE OF PROGRAM COSTS IN HIRING QUALITY STAFF AND NOT -- KIND OF FREE IN PERSON RATES.

BUT IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE TEAMS IN MOTION PROGRAM. AND AS JAMIE STATED IT'S FOR STUDENTS FROM. TWELVE TO TWENTY TWO AND WE'VE HAD. A REALLY BAD HIRING CRISIS FOR THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY THIS YEAR WERE WERE FULLY STAFFED THIS YEAR BUT WE'RE CROSSING OUR FINGERS. BECAUSE THE STAFF IS REALLY COMMITTED TO THE STUDENTS INDEPENDENCE AND THE HAPPEN GO ON INTO INTO MORE ADVANCED ADVANCED PROGRAMS. TO ENHANCE THEIR INDEPENDENCE -- BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY'RE GONNA STAY BECAUSE OF THE RATES IN THE RE SEVEN CHANGED FOR YEARS. AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING INTO TAYLOR DAY AND WE SURVEYED A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES WHO. HAVE THE STUDENTS WITH TEENS IN MOTION AND 90% OF THEM ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE TAYLOR DAY SERVICE BUT IT'S ONLY. THIRTY TWO HOURS A MONTH. THOSE FAMILIES AND IT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE PROGRESS OF OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE REALLY ONE OF THE HAVE BACK TO NORMAL SERVICE. SO IF YOU COULD KEEP IN MIND THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND OF COURSE WITH THE YMCA SO COURSE WE HAVE. IT'S OUR MIDDLE NAME AND TEENS EMOTION WAS OF GREAT SUMMER CAMP. AND TO KEEP THAT GOING -- JUST PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE INCREASES THAT YOU GUYS ARE FIGHTING. FOR REMEMBER REMEMBER THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS A MEMBER THE CAP SPACE.

IT'S NOT GOTTEN IT WILL JUST KEEP PUTTING IN AND THERE TO DO THAT I ALSO HAD A BILL. THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY EXTENDED SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ID POPULATION SO IT WENT THERE WAS NO GAP. THAT ALSO GONNA REMOVE. SO. WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON ON THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE VALUES SOCIALIZATION [INAUDIBLE] THANK. HI. MY NAME IS JULIE AUSTIN I AM ON THE STATE COUNCIL FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THIS YEAR AGAIN. AND I ALSO -- CHAIR THE LEGISLATIVE AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE COUNCIL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OR BASS I AM YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND I MET YOU OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL IN MAY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME. I DO REMEMBER THAT. SO IT'S NICE IS YOU IT'S REALLY AWESOME THAT YOU'RE HERE -- MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM THE MOTHER. OF THREE CHILDREN AND MY YOUNGEST IS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AND SHE HAS A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SHE'S HYDROCEPHALUS TERRIBLE POLICY AND SEVERE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES -- SO MY QUESTION IS -- NOT ONLY FOR YOU AS LEGISLATORS BUT ALSO FOR CARLA. CARLOS IS STILL HERE. AND MY QUESTION IS ABOUT. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BECAUSE THE LOTTERY AND THE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE CHOSEN TO BE PART OF THE AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. THAT WAS IN OCTOBER. IS THAT CORRECT YEAH. THAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER YEAH. AND SO. HOWEVER THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE PROGRESS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL ON IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO WOULD BE. RESPONSIBLE OR ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND WHAT IS THE TIMELINE. SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HAVE YOU TO WORK TOGETHER. AND HILL REPORT OUT FOR YOU FOR US OKAY. SO THEY ARE MAKING THE WORLD SO WE DO YOU CAN HAVE A PRIVATE DISCUSSION WITH. OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD EVENING. HI MY NAME IS JOHN THE AND THIS IS MY BOOK BECAUSE THE KNEES SHE'S A SAVE THE SUPPORT ME -- I'M FROM THESE COUNTING AND I'M IN THE BIG DREAM. OF LIVING [INAUDIBLE] SERVICE. COACH THING SOME HANDS OF WEAPONS AND THAT I BELIEVE. THEY'RE STRONGLY -- IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY ANYONE OF WORK I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE RIGHT TO WORK EITHER FULL TIME OR PART TIME AND NOT EFFECTIVE -- SOCIAL SECURITY. MY NAME'S DENISE BALANCE I'M WOULD DREAM BIG INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES. AND SHAUNA HAS RUN INTO SOME ISSUES WHERE SHE WORKS AND SHE MAKES OVER THE THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS AND JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE OVER A THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS. AND A SIX MONTHS PERIOD WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD YOU NO LONGER DISABLED. THEREFORE THEN HER SERVICES OR HER SSI GETS CUT THEN SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WORK SO I BELIEVE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS POSSIBLY FOR WORK. IS THAT IF THEY WORK. THREE CAN GETS CUT TOO MUCH THEN THEY CAN'T LIVE SO IF WE COULD COME UP WITH A SOLUTION POSSIBLY. TO RAISE THE RATE WHICH THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY SO THEY DON'T GET CUT. THEN I THINK THAT WE WOULD SEE MORE EMPLOYMENT HAPPENING AND THAT THEY WOULD -- STANDARD JOBS LONGER ALSO I JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY I DO AGREE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AS FAR AS LIKE WE NEED MORE WORK WAGE INCREASE BECAUSE JUSTICE THE DOM BRING. KNOWLEDGEABLE AND SKILLED EMPLOYEES TO THE FIELD AND RETAIN THEM IT'S I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD NOW 425- YEARS I STARTED OVER AT HOME A GUIDING HAND. I WENT BACK TO COLLEGE AND THEN I TURN AROUND WORKED AT ARC AND THEN I JUST OPEN MY OWN AGENCY AND SO I AM SEEING THE STRUGGLES NOW THAT ARE WITH THE RATE BUT I AM A PASSION ABOUT WHAT I DO AND I LOVE WHAT I DO AND I'M. NOT IN THIS FOR THE MONEY I DON'T THINK ANY OF US THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM DO THIS FOR THE MONEY. AS IF WE DID. IT'S NOT THE MONEY THAT KEEPS US HERE IS OUR PASSION FOR OUR CONSUMERS OUR CLIENTS WE WANT TO SEE THEM SUCCEED. SHE HAS HAD SO MANY ISSUES TRYING TO GET A JOB AND SUSTAIN A JOB -- JUST BECAUSE OF FLUCTUATION WITH DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES AND OUR WITH DIFFERENT -- AGENCIES AND HAVING. PROBLEMS COME IN BETWEEN HER AND THE WORKERS AND SO I THINK WITH THE CONSISTENT. AGENTS ERA WHERE CONSISTENT WORKER THAT CAN DO THAT AND I'M WITH THE WEIGHT WAGE CAFFEINE RACE THAT WOULD REALLY BE HELPFUL FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR CLIENTS. THANK YOU CAN I ADD SOMETHING TO THIS PLEASE -- I JOIN IS TO MOVE OUT OF MY PANTS PLACE AND I NEED THE MONEY FOR THAT SO THAT WAY I CAN GET AN APPOINTMENT. WORKING ON THAT. LEAVE ME THAT WAS MY DREAM WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WISH I WAS BACK MY PARENTS [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THIS MORNING. I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO JUST TURNED THIRTY FIVE WHO IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE OTHER. PRESENTERS AND PEOPLE TALK YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T WANT DOESN'T TALK THIS NEW CHIU WEARS DIAPERS. AS PHYSICAL ISSUES AND HAS. DIETARY ISSUES. WE NEVER FOUND A DAY PROGRAM THAT IT COULD MEET HER NEEDS WE'VE JUST. BEEN WE'VE BEEN PART OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PARTY HERE IN SAN DIEGO SHE'S PART OF A PILOT. AND WE DROPPED OUT BECAUSE AFTER GOING TO THE TRAINING SESSION. I ALREADY HAVE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN JOB I DON'T NEED TO ADD HIRING. FINING PEOPLE TRAINING PEOPLE. AND AS THE GENTLEMAN FROM YOU SEE HE SAID IT'S HARD TO KEEP GOOD PEOPLE. LOSING PEOPLE TRAINING PEOPLE WE ALREADY DID -- SELF DIRECTED SERVICES. AND I WAS CONSTANTLY TRAINING PEOPLE AND HAVING THEM IN MY HOUSE IF WE GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THE TEEN WHO DIED? THERE'S NO PLACE. AND WE TRAVEL. NEW ZEALAND'S BEEN THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND ACCESSIBLE BATHROOMS EVERYWHERE WE GO WITH IS ACTUALLY PLACE TO LIVE SOMEBODY DOWN TO CHANGE A DIAPER. THIS COUNTRY THE CITY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO THAT'S A BIG ISSUE AND FOR US WITH SELF DETERMINATION IT IS MOVING FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS A COUPLE PEOPLE ABOUT IT'S GOING I'M JUST NOT SURE FOR US WITH. WITH PEOPLE WITH REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD FIT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER TO SAY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO PULL YOUR SERVICES BECAUSE OF I'VE GOT A PERSON WHO CAN GO OUT GO BOWLING THAT'S ONE THING? FIVE WE HAVE A PERSON CAN'T PHYSICALLY DO ANYTHING. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A FIT BUT MAYBE BY. SHARING IDEAS MAYBE WE CAN GET SELF DETERMINATION TO WORK FOR A PHYSICAL. WE CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS. THE OTHER AT THE HEAD AND BE REAL QUICK AS I WAS ABOUT DIAPERS. LORENA GONZALEZ JUST GOT SOMETHING PASSED WITH THEIR TAKING TAX NOT CHARGING TAXES OR DIAPERS AND SANITARY PRIDE. PRODUCTS FOR WOMEN. YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WE'RE INCONTINENCE SUPPLIES SAFE FROM THE AGE OF SIX TO EIGHTEEN WHO MAY NOT GET MEDIC OUT. YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON I GREW UP MASSACHUSETTS THERE'S NO SALES TAX ON INCONTINENCE SUPPLIES FOR CHILDREN. OR ADULTS SO MY REQUEST WOULD BE IS PERHAPS TO CONSIDER. IF WE'RE NOT CHARGING SALES TAX. FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP IT GOT PASSED BY MS GONZALEZ THIS BILL MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED POPULATION AS WELL AS WELL. WE ACTUALLY BY OUR DIAPERS NOT THROUGH MEDICARE HEALTH BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARRY THE BRAND THAT WORKS WELL FOR A DAUGHTER. WE PAY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS EVERY. FIVE WEEKS TO DIVERT. THAT'S A LOT OF TAXES. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND SO IF YOU TAKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SOCIAL SECURITY. IF YOU HAD TO TAKE THAT OUT AND IF SHE'S LIVING IN AN APARTMENT WHAT WHO? WHAT FOOD SERVICES WHAT ANYTHING ELSE? SO MY REQUEST WOULD BE TO PULL THIS ONE TWO SEATER THIS. VERY SMALL POPULATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOL IT WAS 1%. IS ALSO THE FACT THAT ONCE YOU GET OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL NOT A WHOLE LOT OUT THERE. FOR RESOURCES THERE FOR SUPPORT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR COMING DOWN LEAVING.

DIFFERENT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TRANSPORTATION. RIGHT THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THEIR CHILD WHO'S AN ADULT NOW. DOWNHILL BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING NOTHING ROOM ON IN THE DAY PROGRAM FACILITY.

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE I CAME FROM THE WORLD I WAS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. AND NOW I'M IN YOU KNOW I I BANG NAILS ALL DAY LONG WITH A HAMMER. NOW I BANG NAILS ALL DAY LONG WITH MY FOREHEAD. OKAY. AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE COME UP AGAINST. AND BUT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT. IS THE GOVERNOR HER US ERNEST. AND HE WAS WILLING TO WORK FORWARD. HELLO ALL OF US. AND I WAS A COMMITMENT HE MADE TO ME. THIS MORNING. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE MEETINGS WITH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AND HIM. TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ON A MORE INTIMATE LEVEL OF WHAT IS NECESSARY AND BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO TEACH ME. I'M NOT AN EXPERT. WHEN YOU TEACH ME AND I AM ABLE? TO LEARN FROM YOUR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE AND TO SHARE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RELATIVE UP INTO THE CAPITAL. THAT'S WHEN WE CAN BE EFFECTIVE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAS ANGERED FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF SOME POOR FROM FROM THE STATE OF THE PAST DECADE. AND IT'S CRIMINAL IT REALLY IS. YEAH. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IDT CONTINUES TO RISE DRAMATICALLY. OVER THE LAST DAY DECADE AN AVERAGE INCREASE RATE OF ABOUT THREE POINT 7% ANNUALLY AS WE'VE SEEN WITH YOUR INTEGRITY. THE SCENE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW CONSUMERS INTO INTO THE SYSTEM. AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THIRTY IT. DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO THREE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ARE NOW BEING SERVICE AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE. WE'VE SEEN FEW GAMES IN OUR STATE BUDGET TO MEET. EVEN WHEN HE'S. THE BUDGET WILL JUST PASSED DOES INCLUDE A RATE INCREASE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR. THAT'S PHENOMENAL THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN DECADES SO THEY HAVE BEEN HEARING YOU AS MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED. OF THE INCHES MAYBE. FOR IT ALSO INCLUDES ACCESS TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE IN THE RACE IDEA EARLY IDENTIFIED THAT. THERE WAS SOME CITIES THAT ACTUALLY BUMPED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE ABOVE STATE. AND WE ARE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THAT WHAT I CALL THE QUIRKINESS. GOING. FOR AND UNLIMITED THE STATE'S NOT DOING NEARLY ENOUGH. ADD COMMUNITIES BEING LEFT BEHIND WHILE OTHER AREAS OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS ARE BEING FULLY FUNDED [INAUDIBLE] YOU MATTER. YOU ABSOLUTELY DO MATTER. INCREASE FUNDING FOR ADD POP PROGRAMS THIS BUDGET PROVIDES. OF THEY DON'T START UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF THE NEED IS NOW. THE FACT IS THAT SOME PROGRAMS CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT AND AS YOU MEANT HEARD SOME PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY GOING. TO STOP TUNE BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUE. THIS BUDGET DOES LEAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT AND THAT'S JUST WRONG. THESE PROGRAMS ARE STUCK STRUGGLING BECAUSE OUR STATE HAS LEGISLATORS GOVERNORS AND NOW. THIS CURRENT LEGISLATURE. I'VE ONLY MISSED HIM TO INCREASES. IN TWENTY YEARS. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. REJECTED GIVING INCREASED IS SOME PROGRAMS EVEN. THAT IT BELIEVES WILL BE OUT OF FAVOR UNDER FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TODAY THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING SERVICES SELECTED. OF BY PEOPLE WITH ADD AND THEIR FAMILIES APPROVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS -- IN THEIR AREA AND MEET THEIR NEEDS IN YOUR DISTRICT AND MY DISTRICT ALSO. UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN FOR OTHER OPTIONS WE CAN'T SIMPLY ABANDON THESE PROGRAMS ARREST THEM FAILING BECAUSE WE THINK WE MIGHT NOT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING. THREE YEARS FROM NOW COME ON THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SENATE MADE CHOICES TO FUND THE PROGRAMS BASED UPON THE RATE STUDY IT RELEASED IN MARCH. BUT WE KNOW IT WASN'T JUST ENTIRELY UP TO THE DDS I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT. YEAH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU HAVE THE ASSEMBLY OF THE SENATE AND YOU HAVE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT ARE WEIGHING IN ON THESE CRITICAL SERVICES. BUT WE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE RATE STUDY. IS NOT FINALIZED. IT WAS IT WAS PROPOSED. APARTMENT TOOK IN COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC WHICH INCLUDED MANY ADDRESSING HUGE FLAWS. IN THIS STUDY. AND SOME OF THOSE WERE THE RURAL AREAS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY GONNA LOSE MONEY DUE TO THE RATES. TO THE DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO ANSWER THESE COMMENTS BECAUSE THERE WERE. SEVERAL [INAUDIBLE] GOING. FOR BUT WE DO NEED THE ANSWERS. AND IT'S OUR JOB PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY TO COMPEL THEM TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND LASTLY THE REYES STUDY SAYS WE ARE UNDER FUNDING THE SYSTEM BY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. BILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND. WE DE DO. WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND I KNOW EACH OF YOU WILL HELP US GET THERE. ONE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AS A GROWN TREE'S LEAVES AND JOHN. WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET. WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ALLOCATE. AND THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET. THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS TO FILL SO MANY OTHER GALS. WE'RE GONNA NEED A REVENUE SOURCE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR JOB. AS CAN BE OUR JOB TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS.
