WE'RE MY THINK INC GROWING

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.270
AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT WHILE

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.371
WE HAVE WORK TO EXPAND

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:43.273
OPPORTUNITIES --

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.041

STILL HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS SOME

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.346
WHAT THEY REFER TO AS CLASS THE

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.180
CEILING I WOULD JUST SAY

BARRIERS.

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:54.151
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR PRIVATE

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.453
SECTOR CEOS.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.088
COMPOSITION OF BOARDS AND WE

00:50:58.155 --> 00:50:59.222
EVEN LOOK AT THEIR MEMBERSHIP

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.857
FOR LEGISLATURE WE STILL DON'T

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:01.525
HAVE.

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:03.560
A FEMALE REPRESENTATION THAT'S

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.228
ANYWHERE NEAR.

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:08.064
OR PORTION OF THE POPULATION NOW.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.900
ONE COULD DEBATE WHETHER THERE

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:10.667
NEEDS TO BE --

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.302
REPRESENTATION EXACTLY

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:13.837
PROPORTIONATE TO POPULATION AND

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.106
THAT IS A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:18.508
DEBATE BUT CERTAINLY WHEN WOMEN

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:21.845
MAKE UP 51% OF OUR POPULATION

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.113
AND YET WERE --

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.248
IT IN CORPORATE ENTITIES TO NO

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.484
LESS THAN 4% OR SO IN THE

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:30.520
LEGISLATURE 20% ARE UNDER.

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:33.356
THEN YOU CAN SAY THERE'S YOU WE

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.492
NEED SOME CORRECTIONS SO THE

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.094
POINT OF MY BILL IS TO HAVE THE

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:39.463
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUDDEN

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.765
EXAMPLE AND BE A LEADER IN THIS

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:42.933
QUEST.

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.734
AND THROUGH THAT TOO BOTH OPEN

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:47.270
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN BUT ALSO

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.139
TO HOPEFULLY SEND A MESSAGE TO

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:50.774
PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:53.276
THAT WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:55.145
AND APPROPRIATE A RIGHT TO HAVE

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.780
A STRONGER REPRESENTATION OF

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.515
WOMEN.

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.350
SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.619
RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S A NUMBER

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.554
OF STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.056
THAT HAVE APPOINTMENTS THAT

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.757
WHERE EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:08.291
THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THAT

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.893
MEMBERSHIP.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.995
AND SO WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:15.065
BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:17.601
440% OF THE MEMBERSHIP OF THOSE

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.369
APPOINTED BOARDS.

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:20.604
OUR WOMEN --

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.506
AND THAT IS ON OR AFTER JANUARY

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.341
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:25.442
WE'RE MOVING AND IT'S WE HAVE

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.643
SOME TIME.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.478
AND THAT IF THERE IF THE BOARD

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:31.081
IS SMALL SO EXACT FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:31.815
IT'S ONLY A FIVE MEMBERSHIP

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.917

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:36.419
ONE WOMAN.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:39.356
SO THAT'S THE WHAT THE BILL DOES

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:41.291
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT AND IT

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:46.363
ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT --

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:50.800
THERE'S A LOT OF RECOGNIZES THAT

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:53.169
GENDER IS NOT A FIXED CONCEPT

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.639
AND SO IT ALLOWS.

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.275

VALUE NATURAL RESOURCES HERE.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.088
AND THAT THERE'S OVERWHELMING

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:41.023
EVIDENCE BY COMPARING CARNEGIE

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.525

THIS IS A UNIQUE PARK AND UNIQUE

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.633
CASE.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.102
AS FAR AS THEIR EIGHT OHB PARKS

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.637
THAT'S TRUE COMPARED TO ABOUT

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.138
TWO HUNDRED STATE PARKS BUT IT

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:57.206
NEGLECTS TO MENTION THAT THERE

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:59.041
ARE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF U. S.

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.943

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:07.049
THE CARNEGIE GENERAL PLAN FOR

TESLA DOESN'T IN FACT AS AN

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.019
ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES FOR ALL HP

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.353
USE IS PROHIBITED.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.323
IT ONLY DISALLOWS FACILITIES.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.658
ON IN ADDITION [inaudible]

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:18.627
I CARNEGIE.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.396
WE KNOW THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY AND

CALIFORNIA POPULATIONS ARE

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.399
INCREASING.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.801
BUT THE CARNEGIE SRV A VISITOR

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.403
SHIP HAS DECLINED CONSISTENTLY

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.438

IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HAD ABOUT

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:32.408
SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND VISITORS.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.476
WE CONTRAST THIS TO EAST BAY

REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHICH HAS

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.946

AND HAD SEVENTEEN MILLION

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.315
VISITORS.

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.483
THE TERMS OF FAIRNESS WE

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.555
OHP.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.057
BUT THIS WAS BEFORE ALL THE

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:49.458
FACTS WERE KNOWN IN THIS CASE WE

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.693
RECOGNIZE THAT A WHICH WE SHOULD

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.895
BE COMPENSATED THAT ALL PROCEEDS

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.029
FROM THE SALE SHOULD GO BACK TO

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.798
A WAGE FEE FOR PURCHASE OF LAND.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.533
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.601
PREVENT A LENGTHY AND COSTLY

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.902

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:25.334
THE SUNSET WAS REMOVED.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.002
AND IT WAS REMOVED BECAUSE

BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:31.273

THAT NEGOTIATION WAS GOING ON

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.854
THE FRIENDS OF TESLA WALKED AWAY

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.397
THEY SAID THAT INSTEAD OF

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:59.768
SUPPORTING IT THEY WOULD RATHER.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.204
PUT THEIR RESOURCES INTO THE

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.383
[inaudible] TWO REASONS. ONE IS

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:15.717
THAT ONE OF THE MANDATES OF THAT

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.152
COMMITTEE IS THAT THEY CANNOT

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:18.921

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.658
THE SECOND ISSUE.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.059
IS THAT THAT COMMITTEE AS OF

TO SHORT CHANGE THE FUN I THINK

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:15.604
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF A PARKING

WITH THAT STATEMENT.

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:39.427
WOULD TAKING THE STATEMENT OUT.

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.896

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.834
THEN.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.135
THE MARKET VALUE BECAUSE YOU

DON'T YOU OPEN.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.077
THE DIRECT --

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.246
LIKELIHOOD --

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.081
THAT SOME AGENCY DIVISION OR

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.316
DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO DECIDE TO

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.151
SELL IT FOR LESS.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.154
THEN OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.188
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S A GOOD

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.556
QUESTION AYE I DON'T KNOW THE

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.425
ANSWER TO IT I'M HEARING THAT

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.160
QUESTION FROM THE CHAIR NOW I

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.028
IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO SHORT

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.163
CHANGE THE FUND --

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.165
SO IT IN CONSULTATION WITH THE

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:17.832
STAFF IN OUR UNDERSTANDING IF WE

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.668
EXPLICITLY SAY IT MUST BE SOLD

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:22.337
FOR MARKET VALUE THEN THAT WOULD

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:23.805
BE THE LAW WHICH WOULD THEN

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.607
CIRCUMVENT AND THE OTHER LAW

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:26.675
THAT SAYS IT MAY BE SOLD OR MUST

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.076
BE SOLD FOR LESS THAN MARKET

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.511
VALUE FOR CONSERVATION.

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.145
HIT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.746
SELL IT I MEAN FOR THE

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.315
CONSERVATION BUT BUT THE THEN

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.749
NINE MILLION I THINK IS THE PART

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:35.717
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.686
THEN MUST BE ABLE TO GO BACK. TO

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.621
PURCHASE OTHER LAND FOR OFF

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:39.921
[inaudible]

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:40.555
ROAD VEHICLE [inaudible]

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.158
ACCESS.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:45.160
I GUESS THE ONLY AND MY ONLY

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.162
REACTION TO AT THE MOMENT IS

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:47.362
THAT.

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.664
AS WE KNOW APPRAISALS ARE DONE

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.466
BASED ON SOME THAT.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.068
DESCRIPTION OF HOW THAT.

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.235
PIECE OF LAND MIGHT BE USED

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:54.536
[inaudible]

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:55.203
AND THAT [inaudible]

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:58.373
I YOU KNOW WHAT RAISES A FLAG

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.008
WITH ME IS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.343
AN APPRAISAL TO BE DONE IS IF

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:01.976
YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A SUBDIVISION

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:03.311
OUT THERE.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:03.912
BECAUSE THAT WOULD REALLY BE A

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.180
FAIR.

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.247
APPRAISAL OF WHAT THAT LAND

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:08.683
WHATEVER EVENTUALLY BE USED FOR

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.851
APPROVED FOR SELF.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.319
BECAUSE IT GOES BACK.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.354
TO THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE USED

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.689
IN TERMS OF FIRE.

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.024
HOW THAT MARKET VALUE IS

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.058
DETERMINED IF THE MARKET VALUE

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.126
IS DETERMINED BASED ON

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:19.794
CONSERVATION LAND?

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:20.995
THEN I'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.130
THAT BECAUSE THAT WE BE CLEAR

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.699
HOW IT'S BEING VALUED --

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:25.233
BUT THAT WOULD BICU THE

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.368
CAUTION THAT I WOULD PUT FORWARD

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:34.075
ON THAT [inaudible]

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.310
AB WHEN.

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:36.511
WHAT'S BEFORE US IS YOU'RE

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:39.681
WILLING TO TAKE OUT LANGUAGE.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.484
BUT I DO ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.053
IN SPECIFIED LANGUAGE.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.488
THAT IT WILL NOT BE SOLD FOR

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:51.426
LESS THAN MARKET VALUE.

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:52.527
BUT ONCE AGAIN I I'D BE

01:23:52.594 --> 01:23:54.028
COMFORTABLE IF WE COULD DEFINE

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:55.196
THE TERMS THAT I'M NOT SURE I

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:57.332
WERE ABLE TO DEFINE THE TERMS AT

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:57.999
THE MOMENT.

01:23:58.066 --> 01:23:59.601
AND AGAIN I HAD NO ONE THAT I

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.002
DON'T BE DIFFICULT BUT THAT.

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.738
BUT THE REALITY HERE IS TERMS.

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.807
LANGUAGE AND IDENTIFICATION

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.742
LANGUAGE MEANS SOMETHING WE

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:10.078
HEARD EARLIER FROM.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:11.746
UP BOB BUT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:12.881
WHICH SAID.

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.683
THAT THIS IS AN OFF ROAD VEHICLE

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.984
[inaudible]

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:19.454
DESIGNATION AND TO DESIGNATED

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.990
OPEN SPACE AND AVAILABLE FOR

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.525
CONSERVATION SEEMS TO ME TO

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.593
BASICALLY INVITE --

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.562
THE DEVALUATION OF THAT PROPERTY

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.364
SO FOR A LOT REASONS I'M REALLY

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.565
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHERE

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:31.866
WE ARE HERE.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:32.634
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.135
GETTING TO HAVE A RESOLUTION OF

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:37.238
ANY ANY REAL FAIRNESS.

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.673
SIR I'D I DON'T GO THROUGH THE

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.375
CHAIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:41.976
APPRAISAL THAT WAS.

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:43.578
DONE FOR THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.779
PRICE WHEN THEY STARTED TO

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:46.481
ASSEMBLE THESE UNITS AND I DON'T.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:47.982
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:50.051
AND WHAT WAS USED TO AND WHETHER

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.019
THAT APPROPRIATE SOUL WAS

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.487
DEFINED.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:54.489
AS AN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKER

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.123
SOMETHING DIFFERENT I JUST DON'T

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.658
KNOW.

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:57.292
I DON'T KNOW IF THE COUNTY HAS

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.027
ANY IDEA OF THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:24:59.093 --> 01:25:00.895
THAT HOSE PURCHASES HAPPENED I

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:01.963
THINK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.198
SO QUITE SO QUITE A LONG TIME

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.632
AGO.

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.301
LOOK MY LIFE INSURANCE TOO TO

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:07.869
YOU IS THAT I IT'S NOT MY

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:08.470
INTENTION TO SHORT CHANGE THE

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:09.904
FUND.

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:11.639
I THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT GET

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:13.174
THE BEST VALUE THEY COULD.

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:14.108
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.143
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.011
DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE IS A

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.980
SUBDIVISION.

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.415
BECAUSE IT'S A WIDE EXPANSE OF

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:21.749
LAND IN THE COUNTY MAY HAVE ITS

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:24.285
OWN FOR HOUSE EVERY FIFTY ACRES.

01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:25.320
AND THEN YOU GET A SITUATION

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:27.222
WHERE THE MARKET VALUE WAS TWO

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:27.989
HUNDRED HOMES AND I I DON'T

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.691
THINK THAT'S FAIR EITHER CELLS

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:30.225
TRYING TO FIND THAT RIGHT

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.059
BALANCE.

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:32.527
I THINK THE I THINK THEY THE

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.762
IDEA THAT THAT.

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:36.297
THIS IS GOING TO BE --

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:38.233
APPRAISED AT AT THE SUBDIVISION

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:41.269
I THINK IS A VERY EXCESSIVE --

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:44.072
AND AUTUMN.

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.807
DETERMINATION HERE ARE JUST AS

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:47.675
EXCESSIVE AS SAYING THAT WE'RE

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.043
GOING -- TO

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.811
APPRAISE THIS IS CONSERVATION

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.446
LAND.

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:53.248
THIS HAS GOT TO BE AN OPEN

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:54.382
MARKET FREE MARKET.

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.317
A ASSESSMENT OF THIS THAT'S MY

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:57.285
FIRST CONCERN I DON'T THINK

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:58.920
WE'RE GETTING THERE HERE.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.289
MY SECOND MY SECOND THE CONCERN.

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.292
REALLY IS THE EVEN IF YOU MADE

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:06.327
THE FOR THE FUND HOLE THE IDEA

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.962
THAT YOU CAN FIND A SIGNIFICANT

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:08.963
REPLACEMENT WITH THIS KIND OF

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.331
VALUE IN THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:13.301
BY OFF ROAD FOLKS --

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:15.470
I JUST THINK IS OF UP A REAL.

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:18.540
UP A DIFFICULT POSSIBILITY I'M

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.441
BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF THIS IS

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:22.143
SIMPLY A MANEUVER.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.645
IN ORDER TO TAKE THE GROUND AND

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:25.146
TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.815
NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR CLAIMS THAT

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:28.616
YOU JUST BASICALLY TRYING TO DO

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.552
SOMETHING HERE BUT IT DOES FEEL

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.020
LIKE THAT TO ME AND I I'M

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:35.957
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.325
AND I AND I DON'T THINK.

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:38.826
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS BEEN

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.261
OF LESSEN FORTHCOMING THAT IS

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.230
THAT IS THE PURPOSE.

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.298
THAT IS THE PURPOSE IS TO TAKE

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:43.932
THIS LAND AND DO SOMETHING ELSE

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:47.101
WITH IT.

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:50.772
THAT'S THE PURPOSE NOT RIGHT NOW.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:51.673
THAT THAT UP SO THAT'S WHAT

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:52.373
WE'RE NOT WITH THE BILL BUSINESS

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.441
IS TED THAT THE PURPOSE THAT THE

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.342
LAND WAS PURCHASED.

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.377
THE DESIRE FOR THAT PROPONENTS

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:56.844
IS THAT IT BE USED FOR

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:59.213
CONSERVATION.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.015
I THINK THAT THAT.

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.017
FOR ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER AND I I

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:05.186
HAD THE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:06.821
THIS BILL IS DUE AT THAT THE

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:07.522
THESE WARRING PARTIES BEEN

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.324

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:35.550
DISTRICT BILL.

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:36.417
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:37.685
TODAY DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:38.553
DOESN'T TAKE A SIDE IN THE

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.222

I AM AND IT'S NOT MY ATTEMPT TO

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:51.199
CURTAIL THAT ACTIVITY --

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.400
IT'S TO GIVE AN OPTION THE

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.668
DEPARTMENT THAT THEY GET THAT

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:54.702
THEY DECIDE TO SAY ENOUGH IS

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.671
ENOUGH THAT.

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:57.305
I THOUGHT THAT THE BILL GIVES

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:59.173

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.008

AGAIN I WOULD BE WILLING TO

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.680

IF WE HAVE NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.289
UP I THINK THE NINE MILLION

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:17.058
DOLLARS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:17.659
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:19.527
IF IT CAN'T BE THROUGH THE SALE.

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.796
THEN I THINK THEN I THINK THE

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:22.263
INTERESTED PARTIES IN

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.165
CONSERVATION NEED TO FIND

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:25.800
ANOTHER WAY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.201
THAT FUND HOLE OF THAT NINE

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.536
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:29.570
I AMIF IT CAN'T BE THROUGH THE

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:30.605
LAND SALE THEN I THINK THAT

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:31.906
NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER MECHANISM IN

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.107
PLACE.

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.410
SO WHILE THAT WE CANNOT REWRITE

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.712
THE BILL TODAY I UNDERSTAND IS A

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.313
