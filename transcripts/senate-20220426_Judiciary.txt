ALISON MERRILEES ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF- TODAY I'M HERE WITH SENATOR EGGMAN AND I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF PRESENTING SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH CREATES THE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE RECOVERY EMPOWERMENT. KNOWN AS CARE PROGRAM. CARE COURT IS A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK SPONSORED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE MOST SEVERELY IMPAIRED CALIFORNIANS- THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE LANGUISHING. HOMELESS OR INCARCERATED AND THIS IMPACTS FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CYCLE OF INCARCERATION SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD HOMELESSNESS FAMILIES LOOKING FOR LOVED ONES AND CAN'T FIND THEM IS A FLICKED IT SO MANY CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MY OWN FAMILY- THIS PROGRAM IS A RESPONSE TO THE URGENT NEED FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH UNTREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA. SPECTRUM IN PSYCHOTICDISORDERS OFTEN ON HOUSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN A BASE HIGH RISKS FOR REPEATED HOSPITALIZATION REPEAT INCARCERATION INSTITUTIONALIZATION MENTAL HEALTH CONSERVATORSHIP AND- PREMATURE DEATH. COMPREHENSIVE CARE MEDICATION AND HOUSING HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY PROVEN TO SUCCESSFULLY TREAT AND STABILIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT ARE OFTEN UNAVAILABLE THESE SERVICES ARE OFTEN UNAVAILABLE AFTER ARRESTS OR IN SECURE FACILITIES THEREFORE SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL CREATE A PROGRAM TO CONNECT A PERSON IN CRISIS WITH A COURT ORDERED CARE PLAN FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THAT PLAN FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS THE PROGRAM PROVIDES INDIVIDUALS WITH A CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED SET OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT THIS INCLUDES SHORT TERM STABILIZATION MEDICATION WELLNESS RECOVERY SUPPORT. AND CONNECTIONS SOCIAL SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING AND SUPPORT UNDERLYING INCLUDING HOUSING ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE STABLE AND WELL AS PROVIDING HOUSING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES I HOPE. THE LEGISLATURE. OUR CONCERN STATE ANNOUNCES IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WANNA MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE CARE COURT CONCEPT IS NOT. IT IS NOT CONSERVATIVE SHIP THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE DECISION MAKER- FOR THAT PERSON WHO MAY BE- ILL CARE COURT DOES NOT CREATE A PATH TO REST KERR COURT IS A- IS IN. A CIVIL COURT IS NOT A CRIMINAL COURT IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR FORCED INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION. CARE COURT PARTICIPANTS CANNOT BE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NOT ARREST THEM IF THEY DO NOT COME TO COURT CARE COURT DOES NOT INVOLVE SECURITY FACILITIES. FINALLY CARE COURT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY RIGHTS. DUE PROCESS IS PROTECTED SELF pIT DOES DO IS OFFERS HOPE. AND A PATH TO A BETTER LIFE FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES- AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET I'M PROUD TO BE HERE WITH UP. THE SENATE. JOINT AUTHORS SENATORS EGGMAN- SEN REGNANT IS GOING TO- SAY A FEW WORDS AND THEN WE HAVE AS WITNESSES- DR MARK GALLI WHO IS PRESENT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM- JUDGE STEVE MANLEY SPEAR COURT JUDGE IN SANTA CLARA. WHO I BELIEVE WILL BE PARTICIPATING BY- TELEPHONICALLY. IN UDAY CUP POOR PRESIDENT OF NAMI- SANTA CLARA- CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN ARMORED- THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING SOME TIME HERE THIS TODAY. AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I THINK PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HOPEFULLY IS GONNA BE ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX AND BEING ABLE TO HELP THOSE WHO MOST DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP- WE KNOW THAT I'M- LOOKING AT. THESE LAST TWO YEARS COMING OUT THE PANDEMIC THE PROBLEMS WE HAD BEFORE EXIST AND EVEN MORE HEIGHTENED LEVEL AND RIGHTLY SO I THINK THE PUBLIC IS SAYING WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THIS WE CONTINUE TO TRY- DEPOSIT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AND I HAVE BILLS IT'LL BE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LATER. TO IMPROVE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. BUT WE NEED A DIFFERENT ON RAMP THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING. INTO A TOTALITY- THIS PLAN PUT FORWARD BY THE GOVERNOR AND VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE WITH CENTER ON BURKE- COMES OUT IN A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT WAY A WAY THAT IS MORE ENGAGING ON THE UP FRONT. AWAY THAT INVITES PEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS IN A WAY THAT COLLABORATIVELY MAKES A PLAN THAT MUST INCLUDE HOUSING STABILIZATION AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- MY ROLE IN THE SENATE IS AS THE- BUDGET SUB CHAIR ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. IN SINCE I BEGAN THE SENATE WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM INTO OUR HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM. AND I'M NOT SAYING AND THIS WILL IMPACT HOMELESSNESS ON A BROAD SCALE BUT THIS BILL I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION IS CARE COURT WILL HELP THOSE WHO ARE SICKEST AND MOST DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO A SYSTEM. THAT IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS THAT WE SEE EVERY DAY ON THE STREETS- WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THE SAME THING. AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT OUTCOMES IT JUST HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE- AND WE'D THIS THIS IS A PROGRAM. THAT WILL BE WILL BE FUNDED I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S BE NO DISPUTING IT WILL WILL BE FUNDED IT WILL COST MORE. AND IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT ON RAMP- THE DEALS WITH A CHRONIC ISSUE VERSUS COMING AT IT FROM AN ACUTE. SYSTEM AS WE HAVE NOW- SO WITH THAT AT THE SYSTEM STATUS QUO IS NOT OKAY WE NEED TO DO BETTER- AND I WILL URGE YOU ALL IN SUPPORTING THIS CONCEPT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU- UP OUR FIRST WITNESSES IS DOCTOR MARK GALLI. GALLI ALL RIGHT I. AS IN ROBERT INDICATED WE ARE MOVING ON TO THOSE WISHING TESTIFIED SUPPORT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARING SIX KNOWLEDGE CONSIDERATIONS A CLEANING PROTOCOLS TO THE CHAIR IS TO TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY ALREADY NOTED NOW FOR THE THIRD TIME THERE WILL BE THREE PRIMARY WITNESSES SPEAKING SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN THREE PRIMARY WITNESSES SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. PRIMERS FOR WITNESSES WILL BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES RECEIVE EQUAL TIME BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES ALL OTHERS WISHING TEST WHY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS THEIR NAME AFFILIATION. AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE. THERE WILL BE A- TIME LIMIT OF FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THESE CALLS IN SUPPORT. IN FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR CALLS IN OPPOSITION. THAT'S A TOTAL OF THIRTY.

LIMIT YOUR YOURSELF TO YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ONLY THIS IS HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING- AND IT'S OKAY TO STRICTLY REINFORCE. ARE THESE PROCEDURES GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS AS INTERIM AMBURGEY EDUCATED WE HAVE THE HONORABLE JUDGE STEPHEN V. MANLY AND IT WOULD TAKE A POOR ON THE LINE TEST FIND SUPPORT. DR MARK GALLI IS HERE IN PERSON TO TESTIFY. I ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ARE AND GOOD MORNING ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING SENATOR EGGMAN OF SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU FOR. PRESENTING OUT THIS BILL. TODAY YESTERDAY CAN BE AND I BELIEVE WILL BE A HISTORIC TO THE STORK BEGINNING. THE FIERCE SCRUTINIZING FACE OF HISTORY WELL I HOPE JUDGE TODAY IS A DAY WHERE CALIFORNIA MOVED DEEPER DOWN A ROAD OF COMPASSION AND CARE. VERSUS INSISTING ON STAYING MIRED IN A STALE AND DEADLY YES DEADLY CONVERSATION ABOUT HAVING NOT ENOUGH OF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH OF THAT. THAT'S OUR EXCUSE TO NOT SERVE THE MOST SICK VULNERABLE AND SADLY OVERLOOKED CALIFORNIANS. THE CARE CORPORATE PUZZLE IS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN MOVES BEYOND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES- FRAMEWORK OF LPS. BY RECOGNIZING AND ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IT'S THE PERSON AT THE CENTER IT IS COMMUNITY BASED IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON CONFINEMENT. THE RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO COUPLE TREATMENT IN SUPPORT WITH COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO HASTEN RECOVERY. IT SEEKS TO EMPOWER PARTICIPANTS DURING AND AFTER EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND PROMOTES THEIR MEANT OVERALL MENTAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY. IT FOCUSES ON SUPPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL TO REGAIN INSIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS RATHER THAN HARDLY WATCH IN INDIVIDUAL AND RAVEL IN PLAIN SIGHT INTEL WE NOT THEM FEEL LEGALLY COMFORTABLE SUBSTITUTING THE DECISION MAKING CAPACITY. WITH ADVANCES IN TREATMENT MODELS THE NEW LONGER ACTING ANTI PSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS THE NOTION OF THE RIGHT CLINICAL TEAM IN HOUSING PLAN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY DIED ON THE STREETS OR WALLING CARTS RATED CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY STABILIZED AND SUPPORTED IN COMMUNITIES. CARE COURT AS SENATOR ON BURKE SAID IS NOT FOR EVERYONE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS BY FOCUSING ON A NARROWER SET OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE DEFINED BY IMPAIRMENT IN INSIGHT AND JUDGMENT. SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM WHEN OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS THE EVIDENCE THAT CARE COURT INTERVENTIONS CAN HEAL AND SUPPORT IS WELL DOCUMENTED. I HAVE NOT ONLY SEEN THIS EVIDENCE WITH MY OWN EYES I'VE BEEN A PART OF TEAMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED AND STUDIED THESE INTERVENTIONS FOR YEARS I HAVE PHOTOS OF PARTICIPANTS ON FIELD TRIPS TO A CONCERT OR THE BEACH WHO JUST WEEKS EARLIER WERE JAILED. AS A RALSTON'S ULTIMA QUOTE CHARGE OFTEN A CHARGE OF DESPERATION TO STAY WARM NOURISHED OR SAY. WITHOUT THE HEWING RECOVERY ORIENTED ENVIRONMENT THEY FOUND THEIR WAY INTO. BY CHANCE OR FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SUFFERED MORE GRAVELY AND DEEPLY WITH NO. END IN SIGHT. WHERE HISTORICALLY EITHER THE TREATMENT STAFF FOR BEDS ARE SCARCE OR THE HOUSING PLAN IS MISSING CARE COURT HOLDS OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE. TO PRIORITIZE YES PRIORITIZE DELIVERY OF THESE SERVICES EFFECTIVELY TO THOSE WHO CAN BENEFIT. CANACCORD SUIT SEEKS TO SERVE A POPULATION THAT ISN'T AS SOME SAY AT THE BACK OF THE LINE WAITING FOR SERVICES I SAY THEY'RE NOT IN THE LINE AT ALL. THIS PER PROPOSAL NOT ONLY GETS THEM IN THE LINE THE REQUIRES US IN GOVERNMENT BROADLY SPEAKING. TO PUT THEM TOWARDS THE FRONT. WITH THE CLIENT CENTERED APPROACH THE POSITIVE IMPACT WILL NOT ONLY BE EXPERIENCED BY INDIVIDUALS BUT BY THE COMMUNITIES AT LARGE. BY EMPHASIZING THE CREATION OF A MENTAL HEALTH ADVANCE DIRECTIVE BY AND FOR EACH CARE PARTICIPANTS WHEN THEY ARE STABLE AND POTENTIAL THE- TO AVOID FUTURE EPISODES OF PSYCHOSIS. AT IF THEY DO HAVE A FUTURE EPISODE OF PSYCHOSIS I'M NOT ALL THE GAINS ARE FULLY UNRAVELED. ALTHOUGH HOMELESSNESS HAS MANY FACES IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC YET TREATABLE IS THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE SICKEST OF THE SICK WHO OFTEN NEED EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SUPPORTS TO IDENTIFY THE ROAD TO RECOVERY INSTABILITY. CARE COURT WILL HELP THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WE ESTIMATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LIVE IN TODAY TO FIND THAT ROAD. I HAVE OVER THE WEEKS SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CARE COURT FRAMEWORK HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH AND LEARNING FROM. WAS THIS PROPOSAL THERE FEEDBACK HAS LED TO SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS IN THE PROPOSAL AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLIER ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIP TO CREATE A PLAN WITH ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE A AND DEEPER ENGAGEMENT EARLY THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PERIOD WAS NOT THERE IN THE INITIAL FRAMEWORK WE HEARD AND LISTEN THIS FEEDBACK. AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO ADD IT AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS ADDED IN TODAY'S MODEL USUALLY WELL DOWNSTREAM AFTER YEARS OF INDIVIDUALS LANGUISHING ON THE STREETS HARDLY ENGAGED IN SERVICES THE SAME VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS END UP IN OUR COURTS IN OUR JAILS AND IN IN A CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS SEES WE CAN DO BETTER IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST DO BETTER LET ME CLOSE BY ADDRESSING THE PROFOUND INEQUITY CARE COURT ALSO SEEKS TO ADDRESS ALBEIT IMPERFECTLY. WE HAVE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE NEEDED DEEP SEATED TRANSFORMATION IN ORDER TO AMELIORATE THESE RACIAL AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES OUR RESOLVE TO REPAIR THE SYSTEMS MUST MOVE IN PARALLEL BUT NOT IN CONFLICT WITH OUR INSISTENCE TO IMPLEMENT NEW SOLUTIONS NEW PROGRAMS TO DO THE MOST BASIC THING WE ARE CALLED IN GOVERNMENT TO DO SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE I AM HERE SLEEVES ROLLED UP YEARS CLEAR TO CONTINUE IN THIS CONVERSATION. THANKS FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF YOUR TIME I'LL NOW TURN IT OVER TO JUDGE STEVEN BAILEY FROM SANTA CLARA THANK YOU AND THEN AND- TO BE CONSISTENT- THAT- USED APPROXIMATELY SIX MINUTES AND WE HAVE- HONORABLE JUDGE- STEPHEN MANLEY AND- WOULD DIE OUT A COUPLE ORDER IF YOU COULD PLEASE RESPECTIVELY LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES EACH. FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE A PHD BUT NOW PROPHETIC COUNTY UPS. TODAY ONLY FOR MYSELF I DO NOT SPEAK OF THE REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL. NOR THE COURTS. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FAMILY- INDIVIDUALS IN THE COURT SYSTEM. FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE CARE COURT PART THAT THE ONE GROUP AT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY. MANY OF WHOM LIVE AND FILE THE STREETS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN JAIL. I SEE THIS EVERY DAY THEY CONTINUE TO SUFFER TRAUMA POVERTY AND DISCRIMINATION AND STIGMA. THESE INDIVIDUALS LIBERAL REALITY CANNOT MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS THEY FOLLOWED BELIEVES DELUSIONS A REALTOR BAM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEADS TO A WIDE THE BLUES FROM THE STREET TO THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS AND LEAD TO JAIL FOR A NEW OFFENSE. AND I. YOU THEY CARS. ALL RESULTS IN MARCH STAYS IN CONSTANT. WHAT IS MOST TRAGIC MY VIEW IS THE FACT THAT AS WE HAVE REDUCE THE GENERAL POPULATIONS ARE JAILS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE NUMBER AND PROPORTION OF MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN CARE COURT HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED. DOCTOR FOSTER'S. NOT PEROTIS. COURT SHOULD BE HERE TO PROTECT AND SERVE THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE. MY CHALLENGE THE CHALLENGE FOR ANY JOB. IS TO FIND ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. BUT THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY RATHER THE CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR WATCHING THE SAME CYCLE REPEAT ITSELF. BUT THE CARE COURT BILL MAKING THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT CRIMINAL IS VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WITH THEIR OWN SUPPORTER ON THEIR OWN JOURNEY IT'S A NEW ROLE OF APPROACH WITH THE DEDICATION OF SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR HOUSING TREATMENT AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY DO NOT EXIST IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ONGOING COURT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS IMPORTANT. AND WE SHOULD BE THERE TO PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. I WOULD LIKE THEIR OWN ROLES WITH A BRIEF EXAMPLE THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME VERY MUCH THANK YOU YOUR HONOR- I THINK- WE ARE GOING TO NOW MOVE ON TO- WITH A COUPLE WERE ON THE LINE- I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ABOUT. A MINUTE AND FORTY FIVE SECONDS. IT IS SO MUCH. FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THIS AUGUST BODY. AND I HAVE A SON FORTY YEARS FOR FORTY FOUR YEARS OLD WHO WAS GRAVELY DISABLED THE SPECIFIC. FISCAL EFFECTIVE DISORDER HAD WITH THE CORCORAN. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AND IS IN TREATMENT AT THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN SAN JOSE IN FACT WE'RE- GOVERNOR NEWSOM RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE CARE COURT INITIATIVE. AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO MEET HIM AND SECRETARY. AND I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS- INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS CONTINUE TO COME TO HARM REGARDLESS OF MULTIPLE OUTREACH ATTEMPTS BY A CODE PENSION SYSTEM. WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF INTERVENTION. THE END UP ON OUR STREETS IN PRISON HOMELESS OR DEAD. MANY FAMILIES SO CONTACT NAMI SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IN DESPERATION TRYING TO FIND HELP FOR THE VERY ILL FAMILY MEMBERS. FURTHER SUBSTANTIATES THIS ASSERTION. FOR THIS SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA AND RELATED DISORDERS. THE CARE CORD MODEL IS AN IMPORTANT OPTION. THAT CAN PREVENT UNNECESSARY SUFFERING NOT ONLY FOR THE PATIENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE FAMILIES. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATIONS ARRESTS AND JAIL TIME. OR YEARS OF HOMELESSNESS IN ORDER TO ACCESS NEEDED TREATMENT. AT THE LEVEL THAT IS WARRANTED ROBUST WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED PLACEMENT. THEN UNLOCK SETTING. WELL THE CIVIL COURT IS A TOOL USED IT IS A SHORT TERM INTERVENTION THAT CAN HAVE LASTING POSITIVE OUTCOMES. THE PROGRAM THAT USES CIVIL COURT COUNT ABILITY WITH COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS WITH EMPHASIS ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NAMI SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND I. SUPPORT IT BUT PROGRAM.

ANDREA WAGNER AND KARIS MERRICK- SOME OF WHOM MAY BE IN PERSON MAYBE TELEPHONICALLY AS WELL- AS WE HAD EARLIER- THERE'S A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES. AND LEAVE IT UP TO YOU YOUR BEST JUDGMENT HOW BEST TO DIVIDE THAT OUT WILL BE TEN MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS TO BE. EXACT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE BETTER BORDERS ARE YOU READY FOR ME. SO HI GOOD MORNING I'M IN THE IMPERATA ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. AND I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNDERLYING GOAL THAT I HEARD ARTICULATED BY BY THE SENATORS IN INTRODUCING THE BILL. WE HAVE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AGREE THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND GET THEM SERVICES THAT CAN HELP THEM GET ON A PATH TO RECOVERY. AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION WITH THIS BILL IS USING A COURT THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE ON A PATH TO RECOVERY- I'M A PERSONAL LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH BI POLAR DISORDER. THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO I WAS A LAW STUDENT HOW MY FIRST SERIES OF SORT OF DEPRESSION AND I WAS LUCKY AT THAT EARLY STAGE IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY DISABILITY. THAT I HAD JUST GOTTEN MARRIED TO THE RIGHT PERSON WE'RE STILL MARRIED SHE HELPED ME GET ON A PATH TO RECOVERY AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CAREER AS AN ATTORNEY. AT WHEN I WAS IN WASHINGTON DC I WAS THE DISABILITY POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SENATOR TOM HARKIN ON THE U. S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH EDUCATION LABOR AND PENSIONS. AND I'VE RAISED TWO CHILDREN WITH MY WIFE. NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ME IF I DIDN'T LEARN EARLY HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF HOW TO GET CARE THAT WAS GOING TO WORK FOR ME AND HOW TO MANAGE MY SYMPTOMS SO THAT I COULD ACCOMPLISH MY GOALS. SO THE QUESTION FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THE NEW DIAGNOSIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST FOR THEM. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT FORCED CARER WORKS WELL FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S A GOOD EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT IT. I HEARD SENATOR I'M BURKE SAY THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT INVOLVE FORCED CARE SO THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IN OPPOSITION IS. HOW DO YOU HAVE A COURT ORDERED CARE PLAN. WITHOUT FORCE. AND END TO THEIR- THAT ALL THAT HOW. IS THE BILL EXPLAIN. SAYS YOU CAN ORDER HOUSING. SO IF THE COURT CAN ORDER HOUSING HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE. THAT THE HOUSING AND PRIORITIZE THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE. THIS PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRICAN AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OFTENTIMES. INCORRECTLY SO LET'S ALSO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT AN UNINTENDED. NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE PROPERTY FROM AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY HOMELESS. AND DISPROPORTIONATE GAIN THESE DIAGNOSES. AND NOW I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO ANDREA WATSON. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE RUN ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU ANDY AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND OUR SYSTEM EXCUSE ME I'M HERE- I STATE INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CAMPRO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PEER RUN ORGANIZATIONS. AND I AM HERE- FOR CAMPERS VISION THAT WE HAVE HAVE ARDENTLY OVER MANY YEARS BEEN OPPOSED TO FORCE TREATMENT WE FEEL CARE QUARTERS IS IN LINE WITH THAT VISION OF BEING OPPOSED TO- FORCED TREATMENT WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW IN COMMUNITY VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES ARE REALLY. THE ANSWER AND WE ENVISION A SYSTEM WITHOUT WELL AFTER MY LAST HOSPITALIZATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AFTER MY SON DIED OF BRAIN CANCER. THAT I FOUND- WELLNESS CENTER WHILE I WAS STAYING AT A HOMELESS SHELTER. AND THAT EXPOSURE TO THE WELLNESS CENTER OF A COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT AND EXPOSURE TO PEER SUPPORT DID MORE FOR ME THAN TWENTY YEARS OF HOSPITALIZATION MEDICATION AND BEING ON THE STREETS. AND I'M IN THE LONGEST PHASE OF STABILITY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I'M ABOUT TO GET MY MASTERS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION OR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. M. I. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I HAD PEER SUPPORT- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY SISTER AND MY OLDER SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA WHEN I WAS A CHILD. SHE WAS NOT OUR FAMILIES THE CRAZY ONE NOBODY WANTED TO LISTEN TO HER BUT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE I COULD TALK TO YOU. ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE ONLY ONE THAT HELPED ME AND REACHED OUT AND HAVE COMPASSION AND TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT. LIFE AB SHE WENT THROUGH CYCLES OF HOMELESSNESS AS WELL- AND SO I COME NOT ONLY AS A FAMILY MEMBER I'M NOT A MOTHER ALSO WITH CHILDREN WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE OTHER SIBLINGS HAVE SUFFERED WITH WARNING AND CLATTERING AND ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO IT IS ALL AROUND ME- AFTER BEING HOSPITALIZED I STARTED WORKING WITH MY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- I WORKED IN CRISIS SERVICES FOR OVER FIVE YEARS I% WORKED FOR ME AS A PEER AND AS A CRISIS COUNSELOR. AND I CAN TELL YOU IS A REALLY ODD FEELING TO SUDDENLY HAVE THE KEYS TO THE UNIT I WAS ONCE LOCKED UP IN AND JUST ONLY BE ABLE TO WRITE THE HOLES THAT I WAS ONCE ON- DURING THAT EXPERIENCE I ALSO COORDINATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE MANY HOLES IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN TELL YOU EXPERIENCE LEE AS BOTH A PATIENT AND SOMEONE WHO'S DONE HOSPITALIZATION THAT THAT DOES NOT WORK FOR MOST PEOPLE- I WANTED TO SEE THAT ALSO IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH LEAD- OUR PROGRAM A CAMPER WE HAVE DONE OVER- THE FORTY LISTENING SESSIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TWENTY SEVEN. TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM IN THE LAST TWO TWO MONTHS OR THREE MONTHS AND WE'VE TALKED TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE ASKING THEM WHAT THEIR NEEDS AND PRIORITIES ARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH NOT ONE OF THEM ASKED FOR MORE FORCED TREATMENT FOR MORE MEDICATION THEY WANTED SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE COULD GO TO GET HELP WITH IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY CAN HAVE NETWORKS OF SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OF A SOCIAL NETWORK OF PEERS THAT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WERE GOING- MY FEAR WITH. AN OUR FEAR AT CAMP ROAD IS THAT- YOU KNOW. THIS REPORT IS GOING TO FAST TRACK PEOPLE AROUND OPS IN INTO CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE THOSE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AREN'T FUNDED AND AREN'T THERE IN THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED TO BE TO SUPPORT THIS PROCESS- WE HAVE- AS A RESPONSES DEVELOPED A WHOLE MENU OF VOLUNTARY OPTIONS. THAT WE SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK AT AS ALTERNATIVES TO ANY KIND OF FORCED A TREATMENT PROGRAM- AND LOOK AT A ROBUSTLY FUNDING THOSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING MONEY AWAY FROM EXISTING PROGRAMS INTO A FORCE OF SYSTEM- I WOULD LIKE TO. JUST OFFER THAT AS- I HAVE A COPY OF THOSE SOLUTIONS- WITH ME IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM AND I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS MOST OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH- KERIS- MERRICK. ARE YOU IN THIS MATTER YEAH ALL RIGHT YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY THREE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS BRING IT ALL HOME WHERE IS OUR TIMER REMOTE HOWEVER SO HIGH MY NAME IS KARISHMA OKAY WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ARMY NATIONAL PEER LEADER I PREFER UP PREVIOUSLY WITH THE L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH SAMPSON WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF MONEY NATIONAL. I'M ALSO A PERSON WHO WAS GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. MY FIRST THING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM DURING A TIME OF CRISIS. OCCURRED WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTIES HERE IN LA. AND THE VOICES WERE RELENTLESSLY WOULDN'T STOP AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW. I WASN'T CODE SWITCHING SAID SOMETHING. AND OUR THAT WAS INTERPRETED AS ME BEING SINGLE FINAL COACHING AS AND- USING YOU KNOW MORE CULTURAL LANGUAGE THAT WITH AN UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HELPING ME. SO HOW BEING DEEMED GREATLY DISABLED AND A DANGER TO MYSELF I WAS HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION. AND THEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED UNDER FIFTY ONE FIFTY. MY MOTHER CAME FROM PHILADELPHIA TO HELP ME FIND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING NONE WAS TO BE FOUND. LONG WAITING LIST FOR SECTION EGHT LEFT US WITH NO CHOICE BUT FOR ME TO GIVE UP MY HOUSING GIVE UP MY DOG. AND MOVED TO PHILADELPHIA. I TREATMENT THAT WITH- THE CONSISTED OF CBT TO WHICH I CAN PLAINTIFF WAS NOT HELPFUL BUT- IF I DIDN'T PARTICIPATE I WAS CALLED NON COMPLIANT. I FOUND OUT WHAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE WAS ALL ABOUT IT WAS NEEDING HELP AND INSTEAD GETTING RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY BEING HARMED PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY AND NOT GETTING MY NEEDS MET. EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT CB TEA IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. FOR MANY YEARS I WAS ON BILLING TO SEE CARE THAT I NEEDED WHEN I NEEDED IT MOST. AND I FELT THAT IT WAS BROKEN AND SO BLACK IN AMERICA THAT IN FACT I. DESERVED PATRICK MCDERMOTT WAS GETTING. OVER 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE HOMELESS OR PLAQUE BUT WE ONLY MAKE UP SIX POINT 5% OF THE POPULATION. FOR DIAGNOSIS OF BLACK MEN WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND THAT IS YET ANOTHER DISPARITY. MY FEAR IS THAT CARE COURT WILL PERPETUATE DISPARITIES YOU'RE A COURT PROCESS RATHER THAN ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL CAUSES. COURTS HAVE NOT BEEN FAIR SAFE OR PLACE OF CARE FOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. AS A CALIFORNIA AS A BLACK INDIGENOUS CALIFORNIA I REALLY WANT US TO HAVE ACCESS TO WE WENT WITHOUT REACH ENGAGEMENT SERVICES. PEER SUPPORT RESPITE SUPPORTED HOUSING AND TREATMENT THAT'S CULTURALLY ALIGNED AND EFFECTIVE. THERE'S A LAKOTA THING THAT. FORCE NO MATTER HOW CONCEALED BECAUSE WE FIFTEENTH WHEN FIFTEEN FAILED PEOPLE WE CAN HELP PEOPLE TO THE VERY BROKEN SYSTEMS RATHER THAN- CREATING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT PEER SUPPORT SERVICES INCREASE ENGAGEMENT ACTIVATION PARTICIPATION IN TREATMENT AS WELL AS REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION AND LONGER TENURE IN THE COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORT INCREASES CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR LOVED ONE REDUCTION OF STIGMA AND INCREASED SOCIAL INCLUSION. IT IS NOT A MEDICAID STATE MIGHT BENEFIT HERE BUT IT IS AN FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US FROM THE SAME CULTURE WHO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND HAVE BEEN THROUGH SIMILAR MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES. TO AID IN RECOVERY JOURNEY. AND MEET US HERE WE- TALKING.

WELL THAT CONCLUDES OUR- COMMENTS BOTH IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS- COLLEAGUES WILL START WITH THE CENTER WINNER AND THEN CENTER WHAT KASKY. I'M GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS CHAIRMAN- SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO MOVE IT- THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK I'M ALSO THRILLED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS INVOLVED- WE WERE DOING- SOME OF THIS WORK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN- WE WERE SORT OF IN A LOAN MAYOR. MAYOR BREED WAS- WAS WITH MY PARTNER IN THAT IT WAS BASICALLY JUST THE TWO OF US- AND WE WENT THROUGH THE MEAT GRINDER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE- QUIBBLING COMMITTEE ON THE ASSEMBLY- AND ENDED UP WITH A MUCH NARROWER BILL. THAT WE WOULD HAVE WANTED AND WE REALLY HAD NO SUPPORT IN THAT- AND SO IT- WE DON'T GO AS FAR AS WE NEED TO SO I'M GLAD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW. I'VE DECIDED TO PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- OF STRUCTURAL REFORM- OF OUR- OF OUR LAWS IN THIS AREA WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITHOUT LEADERSHIP- OF THE GOVERNOR'S JUST TO- POLITICALLY CHALLENGING. PINE ISSUE SOME LIKE THRILLED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVOLVEMENT WE HAVE TWO STRONG AUTHORS ON THE BILL- IT THIS IS ALWAYS AN AWKWARD- SUBJECT FOR ME ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING A BILL OUR MODERNISATIONS I WORK WITH ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS THING AND PARTNER WITH THINGS. CARRY BILLS THEY SPONSOR TURNS EXPAND EXPANDING ACCESS AND FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR ADDICTION- TREATMENT. AND SO FORTH AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THE- VERY LARGE ME. OF PEOPLE WERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES- THAT CONSERVATORSHIP ARE ARE NOT THE ANSWER. TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THIS IS NOT. THE ANSWER IT'S VOLUNTARY TREATMENT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT VOLUNTARY SERVICES IS NOT AND WILL NEVER- SOLVE. THEIR PROBLEM I WILL NEVER GET THEM HEALTHY I AND THAT IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES BUT IT IS VERY VERY REAL- AND THERE IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED. EXTRA HELP- AND SOMETIMES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THEY NEED SOMEONE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM TO GET THEM HEALTHY SO THEY CAN RE ENTER VOLUNTARY SERVICES. AND WE SEE IT PLAYING OUT ON OUR STREETS EVERYDAY- WITH PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S YOUR FOLKS YOUR SLEEPING IN THEIR OWN FECES FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET SCREAMING- CARS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTING IN WAYS WHERE THEY'RE- THEY'RE THEY'RE BASICALLY TRENDING TOWARDS THAT. WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRENDING TOWARDS DEATH AND IT IS TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN PEOPLE WALK ON THE STREET AND THEY SAY WHAT WHY IS THIS HAPPENING. WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND AN OFFERING. EXCLUSIVELY VOLUNTARY SERVICES TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN THAT CONDITION IS NOT GOING TO WORK. ON I KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I KNOW SOME OF THE OPPOSITION TO IT- YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT DIFFERENT- WAYS IN WHICH IT'S IMPLEMENTED OR STRUCTURED- THIS BILL ISN'T VERY EARLY FORM AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO EVOLVE- SO THAT IT IS. A VERY FOCUSED AND TIGHTLY CRAFTED- BILL- AND I'VE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE- AND- BUT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT OKAY AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR STE CHANGES SAYS QUOTE THIS IS ONE PIECE OF IT. BUT. THE OTHER PIECE OF IT HAS TO BE EXPANDING OUR ACCESS. ON ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING WE KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ACCESS WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THE BEST INSURANCE. EVEN THOSE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND I THINK I AGREE I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION. WHY NOT- THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH GOOD INSURANCE CAN'T GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DOES SPEAK VOLUMES- AND WE'RE DOING THAT WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS I AUTHORED THE MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL PAIR MENTAL HEALTH PARITY. ALL LAW WHICH IS THE STRONGEST IN THE COUNTRY- WE DONE WORK. TO STRENGTHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT TO PROVIDE FOR BILLION. DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR pBECAUSE WE HAVE BASICALLY AS A SOCIETY JETTISONED ARE USED. TO JUST DEAL WITH THEIR CHALLENGES WITH GIVE AND GIVING THEM VERY VERY FEW RESOURCES ON. BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID AND WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING THAT WORK AND DO MORE- THERE THERE ARE. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED EXTRA HELP THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION I SUPPORT- AND AGAIN HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. SIR WHAT KASKY THEN SENATOR RUSSELL. I THINK I HAVE EITHER FOR. EITHER FOR THE- THE CHAIR OR FOR JUDGE MANLEY BECAUSE QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION IS ALL OVER EITHER IT'S TOO OPPRESSIVE OR DOESN'T DO ENOUGH AND IS THE COURTS THE BEST VENUE OR ARE WE TAKING WHITE PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SO THERE'S THAT- BUT- COLLABORATIVE COURTS I'M I'M I'M WONDERING BECAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT. CHAPTER NINE WHICH IS ONLY BY WHITE HOUSE HE COULD THINK ABOUT BANKRUPTCY MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCIES BECAUSE- THE REASON IS THAT JUDGES CAN'T ORDER ANYTHING. IF THEY CAN'T NOT UNLIKE A CHAPTER SEVEN OR THIRTEEN ELEVEN THEY CAN SAY YOU DID OR DO THIS AND YOU CREDITORS ARE FOUND IT'S ALL COLLABORATION THEY HAVE TO HAVE AGREEMENT WITH PEOPLE NIGHT AND I WAS THINKING. THOSE COURTS DO THAT FOR MUNICIPALITIES WHEN THEY COME IN BEFORE THEM AND THEY TRY TO WORK OUT THESE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ON WHAT'S THE BEST PLAN FOR THAT CITY TO REORGANIZE TO DEBTS AND FOR CREDITORS TO TAKE A HAIR CUT SO THE- JUDGE MANLEY SAID A BUNCH OF WORK IN COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW WHY WE- CAN'T ORDER. HOUSING AND WE CAN'T ORDER MEDICATION THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HOUSING ADVOCATES AND THE MEDICAL- FOLKS ARE THAT- PSYCHIATRISTS ARE NOT IN THE ROOM WHEN THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON AND I WAS WONDERING. HOW DOES HE ENVISION THE EFFECTIVENESS IF IT WERE IF THE GOAL IS TO HIT SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND. EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T ORDER PEOPLE TO THIS TREATMENT. YES ORDER SET THEM UP WITH THE DISCUSSION I GUESS I'M I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT A JUDGE BUT I WAS WONDERING IF THE JUDGE KIDS COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA OF HOW THIS MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL HEARD HOW IT MIGHT NOT BE SAFE FOR MAYBE. THE CHAIR COULD TELL US HOW BAD. LACK OF. POWER TO ORDER SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING MIGHT ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE THE QUESTION- MISTER DOCTOR GALLEY IS HERE AND I THINK JUDGE MANLEY IS STILL ON THE PHONE BUT- THIS IS. THE A COUSIN TO THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS- THE- OUTCOME FOR THE RECORD IS THE WORST CASE OUTCOME IS A CONSERVATORSHIP WHERE'S AND COLLABORATIVE COURTS YOU MAY END UP BEING BACK IN A COUPLE JUSTICE SYSTEM JUDICIAL COMMIT JUST SYSTEM AND CAN POTENTIALLY BE INCARCERATED THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF THE COURT CANNOT AS I MENTIONED ORDER MEDICATION THE COURT CANNOT ORDER INCARCERATION BUT THE COURT CAN FOR EXAMPLE- SUPERVISE IN ORDER SOME OF THE ANCILLARY SERVICES THAT SUPPORT. THE CARE COURTS SO OUT I'LL NOW DEFERRED TO A JUDGE MANLEY THAN TO- DOCTOR GALLEY THEY WISH TO ADD. JUDGE'S ORDER HONOR. MODERATOR IS THEN IT IS- JUDGE FAMILY STILL ON THE LINE CAN YOU CONFIRM. IT LOOKS LIKE THE JUDGE DISCONNECTED CUT THAT DR KELLY TO JEWISH DATING. WELL THANK YOU DR KELLY THAT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER ONCE ANYONE'S EVER SAID THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN A LEGISLATURE OF- I GUESS MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS AGAIN IT'S THIS. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION THAT'S NOT REALLY FLESHED OUT IS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS INCAPACITATED AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY- ASSUMING MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAVEN'T REACHED THAT INCAPACITATION SO THERE- THERE IF THEY BREACH IT THEN WE HAVE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL TRIGGERS THAT WILL GO IN BUT IF THEY HAVEN'T HOW DOES THE COURT. ORDER A TREATMENT PLAN AND HOW TO HAVE IT WHAT'S THE FORCE OF THE LAW TO DO THAT. I SO THE COLLABORATION COMES FROM A CASE MANAGER FROM UP A PROFESSIONAL FROM THE SUPPORTER WITH THE JUDGE IN THE AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER IT'S- IT SHOULD BE AS IT'S REFERRED TO AS IT LIKE IT'S AN AGREEMENT SO WHILE THE JUDGE CAN'T ORDER THE PERSON THIS IN IT WHAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS AN AFFECT WHAT THE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS ASKING FOR MORE COLLABORATION MORE TOUCHES TO THAT PORTION MORE ENGAGEMENT WITH THAT PERSON THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST BEFORE A JUDGE WITH THE SENTENCE ARE GOING TO BE. HELD AGAINST YOUR WILL OR NOT IT IS A COLLABORATION AND IF IT'S A IF IT'S A FAMILY MEMBER THAT WANTS TO BE THAT SUPPORTER THAT CAN HAPPEN AS WELL AND IT MISS PAID IF THEY IF THEY DO NOT GO ALONG THAT WOULD BE A- A FAIRLY PER PERHAPS AT THAT LEVEL OF TREATMENT WHICH THEN THE PERSON WOULD COULD POTENTIALLY COME IN THROUGH A DIFFERENT DOOR AS I SAID BEFORE THIS IS A DIFFERENT ON RAMP TO OUR SYSTEM SO IN THIS ONE THERE WAS MORE FRONT AND COLLABORATION TO GET AGREEMENT WITH THAT PERSON AND THEN FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. IF THE OPPOSITION MOST OF WHAT THEY SAY YOU NEED MORE ENGAGEMENT MORE COLLABORATION IN FACT THIS IS WHAT THIS IS TO KIND OF GET PEOPLE THERE VERSUS JUST SAYING DO IT AND THEN HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUTCOMES THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ON THEIR OWN. SENATOR AWESOME THANK YOU- AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS AND EVERYBODY WHO'S PUT IN THEIR TWO CENTS A TO FIGURE THIS OUT AYE AYE I WISH WE ALL HAD CLEARER ANSWERS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT CLEAR CUT AND- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE. THE WINNERS. BECAUSE THIS IS A TWEENER BILL. IT IS NEITHER FORCING AS I UNDERSTAND IT NEITHER COMPLETELY FORCING NOR IS IT SORT OF COMPLETELY. ALLOWING YOU- TO CONTINUE THE BILL AND THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU'RE IN SO THAT REALLY MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT- SO I JUST HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT- ONE IS. IF THE TARGETED- MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. IF THEY LACK MEDICAL DECISION MAKING IF THEY LACK THE CAPACITY. HOW DO AT THE SAME TIME- FIND THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF AGREEING TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OR A TREATMENT PLAN. HI MAKE THAT WORK THAT THE DOCTOR GOAL IS GOING TO TAKE THAT. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ADDRESS THIS QUESTION FIRST- FIRST OFF THE PROCESS THAT IS BEING PROPOSED ALLOWS FOR- WIDE ARRAY OF PETITIONERS INCLUDING FAMILY MEMBERS CLINICIANS OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS ARE TO REALLY ALLOW US TO. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING DEEPLY MAYBE WHO DON'T HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER AT THEIR SIDE WHO'VE LOST THEIR COMMUNITY FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO RECEIVE THE FULL SET OF SERVICES AND I'LL REMIND YOU THE CARE PLAN REALLY HAS THREE COMPONENTS. IT'S A TREATMENT TEAM. SO A GROUP OF PEOPLE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SHOW US THAT GROUPS OF CLINICIANS THAT COME TOGETHER TO WRAP THEMSELVES AROUND. INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TO BETTER. SECOND PIECES MEDICATIONS WE KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WE HAVE DEVELOPED BETTER. MEDICATIONS FOR EXACTLY THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE PLANNED AND- IDENTIFIED FOR CARE COURT AND THOSE MEDICATIONS OFTEN. CAN BE GIVEN AS SINGLE INJECTIONS FOR OVER TWO WEEKS OR A ONE ONCE A MONTH AND INJECTION THAT DON'T REQUIRE YOU TO SEE. DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY OF DAILY TREATMENTS AND LOCKS OR OTHER CONFINED SETTINGS SO IT ALLOWS US TO DO THE THIRD PIECE WHICH IS FOCUSED ON THE HOUSING PLAN RUN COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING THAT CAN MEAN MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. COULD MEAN HI DONNA FIND A FAMILY MEMBER A LOVED ONE WHO FEELS MORE EMPOWERED MORE SUPPORTED TO ALLOW SOMEBODY WHO'S IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY AND HEALING TO BE AT HOME OR IT COULD BE A COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNIT. IT COULD BE IN CERTAIN HIGH QUALITY BOARDING CARE UNITS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WE HOPE TO SEE THE LEVEL OF HOUSING AND THE AVAILABILITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS MADE THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET. REALLY ANCHOR AND BUILD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT HOUSE SO THAT SUITE OF SERVICES- BECAUSE OF IMPORTANT FEEDBACK FROM EXACTLY THE PARTNERS IN ADVOCATES WHO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THIS BILL HAS A OUR ENGAGEMENT PERIOD IT'S CALLED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PERIOD FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN WHO DO NOT- DO NOT LACK SO OF SUCH SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY AND JUDGMENT CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO. PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATION OF THE PLAN AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PARTICIPANT WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT THERE'S A STRONG ETHICAL COUNT ABILITY ON GOVERNMENT WHETHER THAT'S LOCAL COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHETHER THAT'S ON. CITIES AND OTHERS WHO HAVE FOR I NEED FOR HOUSE. TO COME TOGETHER AND DELIVER A PAIR PLAN COMMITMENT IN THE CAN. OVER TIME TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING SO THE FOCUS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PERIOD THAT ENGAGEMENT PERIOD IS TO BRING- BRING TOGETHER A CLIENT WITH THE WHOLE SUITE OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT SHOULD BE SERVING THEM WITH. MEDICAID REIMBURSABLE SERVICES HOUSING AND A SUPPORTIVE SETTING SO THAT WE HAVE THE PROMISE THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING TO THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR YEARS BEFORE NOW. AND WE HOPE TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF MAKING THAT COMMITMENT IN A STRONG SOLID WAY IF IN THE END THAT ENGAGEMENT SETTLEMENT PERIOD IS NOT ENOUGH. THE COURT WILL HAVE TO THE CORK CARE CORE PROCESS MORE OUR ENGAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OVER ENSURING BOTH PARTIES MEET THE FULL GLORY OF THAT PLAN OVER THE COURSE OF THAT FULL YEAR WITH THE ELECTION OF A SECOND YEAR IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THANK ONE MORE SURE BUT ONE MORE QUESTION IS- WHY NOT OR IS THERE WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO OFTEN. TO THIS ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT BEING RIGHT HAVE YOUR DISHES AMONG SOMEONE CANNOT THEM I MEAN SOMEONE CAN FOR EXAMPLE IN ESSENCE SELF REFER IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY DR KELLY SHAKING HIS HEAD IN THE AFFIRMATIVE YEAH OKAY OKAY SO THEY THEY GOT CAN OKAY. AND I'M SORRY JUST ONE MORE ON THE HOUSING ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I THINK DR KELLY STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT- THAT THERE MAY BE HOUSING OF A FAMILY MEMBER HAS. COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S THAT CAME UP- BY OPPOSITION A NUMBER OF TIMES AND WE KNOW WE ARE WOEFULLY. YOU KNOW BEHIND ON THE UNABLE TO PROVIDE HOUSING SO- FIRST OFF THE HOUSING PLAN COMPONENT. OF CARE COURT IS MEANT TO BE BROAD BECAUSE WE KNOW THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE A VERY APPROPRIATE ACCESSIBLE OUR ABILITY TO LIVE WITH A FAMILY MEMBER WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT AWAY AND SUGGEST A DIFFERENT OPTION IS BETTER. BUT IN THAT CONTINUUM OF HOUSING OPTIONS INCLUDES HOUSING WITH A FAMILY MEMBER A COMMUNITY MEMBER ALL THE WAY TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR MORE- SERVICE ENRICHED HOUSING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IF THAT IS WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. WHAT IS CALLED IN THE PLAN AND WHAT HAS BEEN BACKED BY RESOURCES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS INCLUDING A PROPOSAL FOR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THIS YEAR. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING TO SUPPORT EXACTLY THE POPULATION CARE COURT MIND. I KNOW THAT WE TALK DAILY ABOUT THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND OF THE MOST AT RISK SIX CALIFORNIANS WE CAN MEET THEIR HOUSING NEEDS WITH THOSE RESOURCES IT'S GONNA TAKE PRIORITIZATION. IT'S GONNA TAKE IDENTIFICATION OF THE APPROPRIATESENTENCE BUT WE CAN DO IT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOLVING EVERY FACE OF THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOLVING ONE OF THE MOST CURABLE- A HEARTBREAKING FRANKLY COMPONENTS OF THIS ISSUE. I WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE SOME OF THE STORIES OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHO ARE CLEARLY LACK SOME OF THE DECISION MAKING AN INSIGHT CHALLENGES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND WE CAN DO BETTER. AND SO THE HOUSING COMPONENT YES IT'S A CHALLENGE TO HOUSE EVERY CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT BUT SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM WE CAN DO THAT IN THIS PROGRAM IS COMMITTED. TO HELPING MAKE THAT. IF I COULD HAVE THING WE REFER SOMETHING FAMILY. BECAUSE MOST FOLKS SOME KIND OF FAMILY IN IN THEIR LIFE WHO HAVE HAD TO SET REAL LIMITS OR BOUNDARIES AND YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO STAY HERE IF YOU DON'T COMPLY SO HAVING THIS. COLLABORATIVE PROCESS GIVES A FAMILY MEMBER- MORE EASE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE THAT PERSON AND KEEP THEM THERE AND HAVE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH WITH- AND THEN JUST TO THAT SEVEN TO TWELVE IT IS A SMALL. DEMOGRAPHIC IT IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST ASKING THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST SIX SUMMER STREET TO GET IN LINE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE FOR A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER AND THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR. I JUST WANNA SAY. REALLY THE WITNESSES YOUR YOUR WORK-AND DOCTOR GALLEONS AND JUDGE MANLEY- THESE ARE REALLY TOUGH DECISIONS THAT WORLD BEING. YOU KNOW. ESTIMATE AND- WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY HOW EVERYTHING IS GOING TO REALLY WORK OUT. RAST TO TAKE A- LEAP OF FAITH HERE- WERE ASKED TO- MAKE A DECISION THAT. MIGHT VIOLATE WHAT WE ALWAYS BELIEVE IT RIGHT THE FREEDOMS- AND THE CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN- SO. I JUST WANNA SAY IN MAKING THIS DECISION IT'S TOUGH BUT IT'S TOUGHER TO SEE- HUMAN BEANS ON THE STREET LIKE THAT- BUT IT IS ASKING US TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU HAVE EXPERT WITNESSES. WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THIS TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN OKAY I'M I'M RIGHT HERE I'M IN BETWEEN I'M BEING ASKED TO MAKE THIS DECISION. THAT'S DIFFICULT BUT- I'M GLAD WE HAVE THE WITNESSES THAT WE CAN RELY ON TO HELP WITH TILT IN THAT DIRECTION SO- MORE THAN ANYTHING I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT THAT'S GOING INTO IT SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU SENEGAL'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ADD TO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION AGAIN HAS BEEN STATED MANY MANY TIMES BY MY COLLEAGUES IS NOT AN EASY- DECISION TO MAKE AND I TAKE- EVERYONE'S TESTIMONY WITH- COMPLETE OF RESPECT AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY AGAIN FOR. PROVIDING THEIR COMMENTARY BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE A AS OF THE WORK IN PROGRESS THAT I LOOK FOR TO LEANING IN ON- REPRESENTING A VERY LARGE CITY THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN L. A. COUNTY LONG BEACH THAT HAS ITS OWN HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ALSO- MANY SOUTHEAST CITIES- IN AND AROUND ONE LOS ANGELES. SO HAVE A QUICK COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS AND THE ONE FIVE LOTS OF- OF COURSE CONCERNS BROUGHT BROUGHT BY THE OPPOSITION AND IN VARIOUS DEGREES BUT WANTED OF WHICH IS THE PRESUMPTION CONCERN ON NON COMPLIANCE AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT AND THEN SECONDLY BROUGHT UP ANOTHER VALID CONCERN NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE- YOU KNOW PER VIEW LET'S SAY OF THE JUDICIARY BUT- THE RACIAL INEQUITY CONCERNS BECAUSE THOSE ARE JUST CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY- UNFORTUNATELY THE DATA SHOWS THAT. THERE MAY BE MORE MISDIAGNOSIS- FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA- PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS FOR FOLKS THAT IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING THROUGH THAT AND I THINK IT THE LEAST THIS WOULD LIFT UP THOSE ISSUES SO WE CAN DISCUSS THEM GREATER- IN A GREATER. WAY DR KELLY WILL TO THIS BUT I JUST ALL. THE TO GO BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE DIAGNOSIS THAT'S ME OFTENTIMES AT THIS LEVEL THE GOAL IS IN AGAIN THE MONEY WE PUT IN FOR- TO STAND UP A WHOLE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLATFORM FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO TWENTY SIX TO BE ABLE TO GET AN EVALUATION. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WILL ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING ISSUES THE- OF RACIAL EQUITY THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE SURPRISED THAT WE SEE ON THE STREETS THIS IS AN ISSUE OF ACCESS AND EQUITY OVER GENERATIONS. AND SO THE EARLIER THAT WE START INTERVENTION AND TREATMENTS THE LESS OF THAT DISPARITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. YEAH- LET ME SAY A COUPLE THINGS FIRST THANK YOU FOR REALLY LIFTING UP THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO FURTHER UPSTREAM YOU CANNOT SEE CARE COURT IN ISOLATION IF ALL OF THE OTHER WORK. THAT IS HAPPENING LARGELY BY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITHIN COMMUNITIES. THE FUNDING COMES THROUGH THE STATE THE LEGISLATURE ME TO SAY OTHER FUNDING FOR MEDIC. CADE SERVICES REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT YET. WE HAVE SUCH A CHALLENGE AND IT WAS EXACERBATED DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT IF YOU TRY. TO LOOK AT CARE COURT IN ISOLATION OF EVERYTHING YOU WILL GET A COMPLETE OR AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE. IMMEDIATELY THAT IS I THINK ONE POINT. THE SECOND THING IS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE SPACE AND L. A. COUNTY. OUR TEAM. ARE LARGELY THROUGH WORKING WITH DIVERSION PROGRAMS WORKING WITH COURTS. THAT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY. HAS BECOME THE PLACE WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS GET. YOURS AGO WHEN I MET JUDGES AND ONLY. THEY WOULD SAY A FULL 30% OF MY DOCKET. IS INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT THAT WAS WIDESPREAD EVERY COURT THROUGHOUT THAT LARGE COUNTY I'M SURE THAT SHARED ACROSS THE STATE. JUDGE MERELY WE'RE HERE IF OU COULD VERIFY THAT BUT THE EXPECTATION. THAT ARE SO MANY INDIVIDUALS TODAY. WHO ARE EITHER MISDIAGNOSED MISLABELED OR A PROPERLY DIAGNOSED ONLY AFTER THEY ENCOUNTER THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM. END UP IN OUR JAILS AND PRISONS AND TO GO UPSTREAM FOR THAT POPULATION. OFFERS SOMETHING LIKE THE CHARACTER MODEL CIVIL PROCESS ONE THAT LOOKS AT ENGAGEMENT FIRST LOOKS AT. REALLY BUILDING A COLLABORATIVE CARE PLAN INITIALLY. BUT WE KNOW THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR EVERYONE. AND SOME PEOPLE WILL NEED THE SUPPORT NOT JUST FOR THEM BUT TO MAKE SURE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE FUNDED TO SUPPORT THEM. ARE ABLE TO COLLABORATE AND COMPLETE A PLAN. THERE ARE DEEP INEQUITIES IN OUR SYSTEM. WE ARE AWARE OF THOSE WE DO A LOT IN CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEM YET WE SEE THEM PERSISTING. CONTINUE WE NEED A NEW WAY. CARE CORD ISN'T IGN TO THOSE THERE WILL BE INVESTMENTS IN EVALUATION AND A COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE ISSUES BUT THE PRESENCE OF THOSE ISSUES. CANNOT BECOME OUR EXCUSE TO NOT TO TRY TO DO MORE WE NEED TO DO BUT- THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WE NEED TO WORK ON IMPROVING THOSE ISSUES ADDRESSING THEM. THROUGH THE INVESTMENTS I MENTIONED IN MAKING SURE. THAT THE SUPPORTER ROLE WHICH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS PLAN. REFLECTS AND SUPPORTS THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER THEY MAY BE. AND UNDERSTANDS THEIR WISHES OVERTIME AND COMMUNICATES THOSE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE CARE PLAN SO I THINK THOSE PIECES NEVER A PERFECT ANSWER. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL WORKING PROGRESS ON THIS BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA. IN THIS BILL- ARE KEEPS A FRIEND OF MINE IT WILL MAKE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE A COMMITMENT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. MANY HERE TODAY MANY OUT AROUND OUR STATE TO MAKE SURE WE DO THAT THE RIGHT WAY. THANK YOU LAST FEW SOME PRESUMPTION AND- SORRY DR KELLY THANK YOU. I'M THE PEACE AROUND PRESUMPTION SO ARE THE BELIEF IS THAT THROUGH THE CARE CORE PROCESS LEAD OVER THE COURSE OF OUR MAMA INDEED NOT AGGRESSIVE BUT CERTAINLY CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING PEOPLE FORWARD AND A COMMITMENT TO DELIVER A FULL SUITE OF SERVICES THAT WE KNOW ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I WOULD THAT OUR IS NOT ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL RETURN TO SETTINGS WHERE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER AND DECOMPENSATED AND THAT IDEA THAT THE EXPERIENCE IN THE CARE COURT MODEL IF NOT EFFECTIVE SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED AND SHOULD BE USED IN THE CASE THAT SOMEBODY COMES AGAIN TO THE HOSPITAL OR IS IN ANOTHER SETTING AND THIS IDEA THAT- WE HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH EVERY IME. DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THEN WE HAVE O TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PRIOR ATTEMPTS IN PRIOR WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO DOWN A CONSERVATORSHIP PATHWAY THE BIG CARE COURT EXPERIENCES AT LEAST ACCOUNTED FOR SO THAT PRESUMPTION IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE PROCESS THERE WERE HONEST AND TRUE ABOUT THAT BUT THERE WE ARE DON'T FORGET IT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO DELIVER AND SERVE INDIVIDUALS. AND OTHER SETTINGS IF THAT'S. THE ONLY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE LEFT FOR US. WELL FOR YOU OF THE THREE OF YOU FOR- THIS DIALOGUE AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS EVEN WARNED WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE BILL. ALL RIGHT- SEEING NO OTHER- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO COMMENT ON SANDERS NUMBER EGGMAN WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. BOB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE FIRST WELL THANK YOU TO THE PROPONENTS THANK YOU DR KELLY THE TICKET THANKS TO MY JOINT AUTHORS CENTER EGGMAN WHO IS THE ACKNOWLEDGED CHAMPION WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BASED ON EXPERIENCE IN AND PASSION HERE SO THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN UP A COUPLE OF THE POINTS LET ME LET ME JUST SPEAK TO THE OPPONENTS YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT- WE RECOGNIZE THAT- YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE WILL HELP TO INFORM THIS PROCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE LIVED EXPERIENCES SO MANY FAMILIES. IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE CONCERN ABOUT DOING SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING BOLD SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS LEGITIMATE AND WE AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD WE'RE GONNA LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- BUT OUR GOAL IS THE SAME WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL THAT YOU HAVE- AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THERE TOGETHER SO WITH THAT I'D ORIGINAL VOTE SORRY OKAY.

AND AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HOMEOWNERS WERE BEHIND ON THEIR MORTGAGES MANY OF THESE HOMEOWNERS OWN RENTAL PROPERTY WHEN FEDERAL MORTGAGE FOR BANDS AND THEY MAY BE FORCED TO REMOVE THE RENTAL UNTS FROM THE MARKET SELL THEM IN ORDER TO AVOID FORECLOSURE SB EIGHT FOUR SEVEN ESTABLISHES A GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. TO HOMEOWNERS APPLICANTS. UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE PROGRAM USES FEDERAL HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO HELP HOME HOMEOWNERS GET. CAUGHT UP ON THEIR HOUSING PAYMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE RENTAL PROPERTIES. THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PROVIDED FIVE POINT TWO BILLION TO CALIFORNIA TO PAY RENT FOR SOME LOW INCOME TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE RENT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL RENTERS. WE DO HAVE TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA WERE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT BUT WILL NOT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WHAT. THEY MAKE FALLS JUST ABOVE THE EXISTING THRESHOLD FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS LEAVE THE OWNERS OF THE RENTAL PROPERTY WHO SOMETIMES ARE STILL PAYING OFF THE MORTGAGE ON THAT PROPERTY STRUGGLING THEMSELVES. SB EIGHT FOUR EIGHT FOUR SEVEN CLOSES THE GAP FOR TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE APPLIED AND BEEN REJECTED FROM THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ENSURING NEEDED RENTAL UNITS STAY IN THE MARKET AND PEOPLE DO NOT LOSE THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE THREE WITNESSES. A JOINING US IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED OUR FIRST ONE IS ON THE SHOP. SMALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER A SECOND WITNESSES CHARLOTTE STONE A NOTHER SMALL PROPERTY HOMEOWNER.

THE SHOP CLOSURES GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS ON THE SHINE I'M HERE WITH MY HUSBAND OF NASHA. WE OWN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND HAD A HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE WITH TENANTS WHO REFUSED TO PAY RENT FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS WHY THEY WERE SUBLETTING OUR PROPERTY ON AIRBNB AGAINST THE LEASE AGREEMENT. ALAMEDA COUNTY'S LOCAL MORATORIUM PROHIBITED EVERY ACTION EVEN WHEN TENANTS HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDING THEIR LANDLORDS AND THEY REFUSED- ANY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL. WE ORIGINALLY PURCHASED OUR HOME TO BE OUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE. WE ONLY DECIDED TO RENT IT OUT Y. V. WERE- COMPLETING OUR OWN RENTAL OBLIGATION TO OUR LAND LINE. OUR PLAN WAS TO MOVE INTO OUR HOME RIGHT AFTER. TO OUR HORRIFIC SURPRISE OUR TENANTS CLEAN HARDSHIP STOPPING RENT- EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MAKING MONEY OFF OUR PROPERTY BY RENTING IT OUT ON AIRBNB. AS OF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH THE AIRBNB GUESTS REFUSED TO MOVE OUT AND THE ORDERS NO TENANTS IN P. ABANDONED THE HOME AFTER A DISPUTE WITH THE AIRBNB GUESS. ALAMEDA COUNTY'S LOCAL MORATORIUM PROHIBITED US FROM EVICTING TENANTS AND THE AIRBNB GUESTS AND EVEN IN THIS SITUATION. BY THE TIME THE AIRBNB GUEST ABANDONED OUR HOME B. HAD BEEN FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DRAINED. WE ENDED UP WITH NOT ONLY RENTAL LOSSES THAT AMOUNT TO FIFTY K. BUT ALSO A HOUSE THAT WAS COMPLETELY TRASHED. IT COST AS AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY GET TO MAKE IT HABITABLE. OUR FAMILY MY HUSBAND AND I WE IMMIGRATED HERE WITH A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS WORKED VERY HARD. SAVED UP FOR A FINANCIALLY SECURE FUTURE FOR US AND OUR KIDS. WOULD BE ENDED UP HOUSING PEOPLE FOR FREE OF FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND BEARING HUGE LOSSES NORTH OF HUNDRED GATE WHY WE CONTINUE TO PAY MORTGAGE AND PROPERTY TAXES ON THE PROPERTY WE COULDN'T EVEN. THIS IS THE STORY OF MANY OTHER SMALL LANDLORDS A MOM AND POP AND I LOOKS LIKE US. PLEASE WAIT YES TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU MICHELLE I'M SORRY FOR YOUR HARDSHIP. BOB ALL RIGHT- SHOWED STONE IF. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHARLOTTE STONE IN THEM SINGLE OWNER OF PROPERTY LOS ANGELES AFTER YEARS OF HARD WORK I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE A RENTAL PROPERTY AS AN INVESTMENT IN MY RETIREMENT AND WITH THE HOPES TO ONE DAY ABLE TO CARE FOR MY AGING PARENTS. MY TENANT HAS NOT PAID RENT FOR RENT FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND AS OF TODAY OWES OVERSIGHT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND AND RENTS. THE LAW THE LOS ANGELES PROHIBITS ME FROM FILING AN EVICTION AGAINST HIM DURING THIS TIME I'VE CONTINUE TO PAY MORTGAGE MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND PROPERTY TAXES BUT THIS BECOME A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AS SOON AS THE HOUSING IS KEY. PROGRAM WAS UP OPERATIONAL I APPLIED FOR RENT RELIEF DOLLARS AFTER MANY FORMAL WRITTEN NOTICES TO THE TENANTS ASKING THAT HE APPLY I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE HE DID EVENTUALLY APPLY BUT I WAS UNAWARE OF HIS APPLICATION BECAUSE HE FAILED TO INFORM ME. AND THE HOUSING IS KEY SYSTEM DID NOT LINK OUR APPLICATIONS. WHEN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO SPEAK TO A HOUSING IS KEY ADMINISTRATOR I WAS INFORMED THAT THE HOUSING IS KEY- PROCESS HAD SENT A CHECK DIRECTLY. DIRECTLY TO THE- OR FORTY ONE. NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS THAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER TWENTY NINTH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS OF TODAY THE TENANT HAS NOT PAID THOSE DOLLARS TO ME AS REQUIRED BY LAW. I REPORTED THIS TO THE FRAUD UNIT AND IT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE FRAUD UNIT AT. THE FRAUD UNIT IT IS HAS NOT I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM NOR HAVE I HEARD FROM THE TENANT. WHO CONTINUES TO LIVE IN THE PROPERTY AND NOT PAY RENT. THE TENANT IS THE SUCCESSFUL SCREENPLAY WRITER FILMMAKER DIRECTOR PRODUCER AND LECTURER.

YEAH THEY'RE CURRENTLY NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S TURN TO OPPOSITION I HAVE LISTED TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BRIAN AUGUSTA AND TINO SALAS MR GUSTER. GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS BY A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YEAR OF OUR OUR CONCERNS ON THIS BILL. FIRST ONE OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS AND- IT SOUNDS LIKE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS ARE FORTHCOMING FROM THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND SO I WILL NEED TO. WE NEED TO REVIEW THOSE AND REVIEW OUR POSITION IN LIGHT OF THAT SIZE THAT STANDS NOW OUR POSITION ON THE BILL AND PRINT IS THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS ALL EXPLAIN AND I ONE OF KNOWLEDGE. OF THE HARDSHIP THAT THE TWO PRIOR WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED I THINK THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WHAT PROGRAM ARE WE GONNA CREATE THE STATE LEVEL. THAT THAT ADDRESSES. AND THAT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE JUST TO. OR SO WEEKS AGO THIS COMMITTEE HEARD AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE AND THAT'S MISTER GRAYSON AND BUSYWORK SPELL WHICH ESSENTIALLY SIGNAL THE END OF- THE STATE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE RENTAL HOUSING- ASSISTANCE- THE RAFT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE BRINGING THAT PROGRAM TO AN END AND THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT THERE IS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS. OF A OF A BUREAUCRACY THAT IS HANDING OUT HOURS AND WE HAVE NOT SOLVED THE MANY BUREAUCRATIC HEADACHES ABOUT TENANTS AND LANDLORDS ARE EXPERIENCING. AND WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS NUMBERS ARE UP ON THE HIGHEST NOW DISCUSSED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR VULNERABLE TENANTS WHO ARE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND WE HAVE DISPROPORTION OVER SPANISH SPEAKING. ARE FOLKS WHO NEVER GOT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE PROGRAM IS NOW CLOSER OF DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF ELDERLY FOLKS WHO NEVER GOT THROUGH THE DOOR WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND BUT THE STATE HAS SIGNALED THAT THEY'RE GETTING OUT OF THAT PROGRAM. AND WE HAD ARGUED AS MANY OF YOU HAVE THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND THAT PROGRAM WHICH EXTEND ITS PROTECTIONS WE SHOULD PUT MORE STATE MONEY BEHIND IT AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE BUT- FOR TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE WITH THE ANSWER THAT AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT SO NOW TODAY WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT STANDING UP A NEW PROGRAM RELY ON THAT SAME BROKEN. I SHOULD SAY TROUBLED. RECEIVE THAT STRUGGLING AUGUST YOU'D GO WRAP IT UP. THE USER. I WILL JUST- NOTIFY THAT. ARE WE FEEL LIKE THIS IN. WE INTERNAL OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL EVERY AT VOTE DON'T ANSWER QUESTION FOR TENANTS TO EXPERT. HARDSHIP AND IS THIS WHERE WE WERE FOCUS. THOSE ALL- I WILL WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ON SOME OF THE OTHER POINT. THAT I. AT THE MOMENT WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CUSTOM. ALL RIGHT. OF THIS RESULT. NOW I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS OFFICE GETS STUCK IN MY HEARING. WELL I HAD THE PLEASURE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TRI MEMBERS TO NORTH DALLAS WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF BRAIN ACOSTA AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND MY SYMPATHIES IN MY EMPATHY IS. TO BE LANDLORDS HERE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THOSE PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PRINT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT BRAND REYES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE- YOUR TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE. EXPANDING AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF STATE RESOURCES. TO MAKE THE LANDLORDS HOLD WHILE NOT. GOING WITH THE GOAL OF THE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS TO STABILIZE AND KEEP PENDANT HOUSE. WE ALSO HAVE- SOME CONCERNS WITH- SOME OF THE MEANS TEST THAT I BELIEVE ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND SO WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A STRONGER LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS TO SEE IF THEY ALIGN- BUT REALLY THE GOAL WITH THE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT THIS BODY HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED WAS TO KEEP TENANTS HOUSE WHILE ALSO. PROVIDING THE ASSISTANCE FOR THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE ASSISTANCE THE CURRENT WAY THAT THIS BILL IS WRITTEN IT DOES NOT HAVE THAT SAME GOAL IN MIND. AND SO WITH THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU pOPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT FOUR SEVEN OR PRESENT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM SEEING NO ONE APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE LET'S TURN TO THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP THOSE. ON THE PHONE LINES IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. EIGHT FOUR SEVEN. AND IF YOU DO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB EIGHT FOUR SEVEN PLEASE GIVE YOUR NAME FILIATION OF POSITION. IN THIS CHAIR LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE MOMENT. JUST NOW WILL GET THE LINE NUMBERS. YEAH THAT'S ONE ZERO IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT. IT WILL START WITH LINE ONE FIFTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD- THIS BILL. GO THANK YOU. IT WILL GO TO LINE ONE TWENTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS JEANETTE AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALSO KEEP. ALREADY THANK YOU MUCH- IS A HOUSEKEEPING MATTER WE'RE GOING TO RECESS HERE AT NOON BUT IF CENTER LEYVA IS AVAILABLE WE CAN TAKE UP HER MATTER- BEFORE WE RECESS AT NOON ALL RIGHT LET'S RETURN HERE TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER GONZALEZ. INSULAR DRAW SO YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THINK YOU- CENTER HER TADO FOR PRESENTATION- JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS- I UNDERSTAND YOU TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT THE LAST POINT OF THE AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS THE STATE'S THAT. PREVENTS THE RECIPIENT OF A GRANT UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR A PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED FROM PROCEEDING TO EVICT THE TENANT WITHOUT AN OUT FAULTS. BECAUSE IT'S IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S- MAYBE THERE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THAT THAT'S SUFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR THE OPPOSITION BUT- CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE AND- WHERE WE'RE AT WE'RE OUT WITH THAT SPECIFIC. AMENDMENT AND WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE TO COME. IN AND CHECK. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE BUT THE REAL QUESTION AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT- TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE- AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE- WORKED WITH THIS COMMITTEE IT TO ADDRESS THE- CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION- BUT I WILL. ALLOW OUR EXPERT WITNESS TO COME UP TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON. THANK YOU. DISCOVER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO FIND A AN APPROPRIATE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE LANDLORD WOULD NOT A VET. IF THEY HAVE RECEIVED GRANT DOLLARS- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ANALYSIS NEED TO BE COMPLETE SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE WHAT. AMOUNT OF TIME IS FAIR WITH OBVIOUSLY THE SITUATION HERE WE HAVE A TENANT WHO ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE- DIDN'T TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS ABILITY SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT ON HOW LONG THAT CAN CONTINUE TO STAY. SO WE WILL WORK OUT THAT TIME PERIOD THOUGH AND THAT IS PART OF THE- COMMITMENT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU Q. AND THEN- ANOTHER QUESTION ON THE STATE DAHLER ASKED BECAUSE I DON'T SEE AN APPROPRIATION HERE BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT- WITH. THE DISCUSSIONS BEEN AROUND THAT- THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN AROUND OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE A BUDGET REQUEST- WE HAVE DONE SOME INTERNAL POLLING JUST AMONGST OUR MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT WERE ABOUT. A HUNDRED MILLION- FROM OWNERS AND THESE ARE SMALL LANDLORDS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE PRIORITIZED WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PAID- I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS. THAT THE STATE MADE IT VERY EASY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO STATE THAT THEY COULDN'T PAY THE TENANTS COULDN'T PAID SO. LEGISLATION OR THE LOSS SAID SIMPLY TELL US YOU CAN'T PAY AND THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW THAT THE TENANTS HAVE TO. DEMONSTRATE THEIR INABILITY OF PAY WE'RE FINDING OUT THEY CAN'T. SO FOR WHAT- SO WE ARE WORKING. I KNOW WITH THE SENATOR ON A BUDGET ASK- I WILL SEE WHAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WILL ALLOW THANK YOU MISS CARP ALL RIGHT. THE QUESTIONS SENT SERVICE ALSO SERVED- SENATOR RUSSELL THANK YOU- MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS ABOUT. SOME AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID- WE ENDED THE RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THAT WAS FOR. OUR LOWER INCOME- INDIVIDUALS- WE ENDED IT AND THEY'RE STILL OUT IN OUR STATE. PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR LOW INCOME WHO JUST CANNOT PAY THE OUTSTANDING RENT- A DEBT- IN HERE WE'RE BEING ASKED TO FULLY REIMBURSE- A JUDGMENT AGAINST A TENANT. WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY- AND USING DOLLARS YOU KNOW OUR FUND DOLLARS TO PAY THE JUDGMENT AGAINST SOMEONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME. SO EITHER HOW YOU RESPOND TO THAT BUT THAT'S MY ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS OF COURSE UP THE WAY THAT I SEE IT IS THAT WE HAVE SMALL A RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS THAT. OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL THAT'S THAT REALLY IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT. THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE FINANCIALLY BURDEN COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES OR THEIR RENTAL PROPERTY WHERE THE TENANT COULD END UP LOSING RIGHT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THERE SEEMS TO BE. AN ISSUE HERE- IN THE STATE WHERE. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING PUT OUT THERE AND THE TENANTS IN NEED THE MOST HELP ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED% AND THE LANDLORDS THAT NEEDS THE HELP TO KEEP THE TENANTS THAT NEED THE HELP OR THE NEED TO HOUSING T STAY AND ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. EITHER SO. I YOU KNOW I SEE THAT IT I SEE THIS AS- IF WE DON'T PROVIDE. SUPPORT ODD TO THE SMALL LANDLORDS- IF WE COULD CREATE OF A WORSE SITUATION AND THE HOUSING MARKET FOR TENANTS BECAUSE IF THEY LOSE THE HOME WAS GONNA COME IN AND PURCHASE THAT HOME IS IT GOING TO BE SOME HEDGE FUND IS IT GOING TO BE. AN INVESTOR THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW WARSOP EITHER PEOPLE BUT- INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT YOU'D- LIKE LIKE MY PARENTS IMMIGRATED FROM MEXICO OR HAVE A STORY THAT'S THAT IT'S NOT ONE THAT'S INVESTOR TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM THEY'RE STRUGGLING JUST AS MUCH AS THE TENANTS ARE BUT THE GO HEAD BIG IT'- THEIR VERY MUCH INTERCONNECTED AND IF. AND THEY'RE LOSING OUT BASED ON ON A SYSTEM THAT HAS FAILED THEM AND ALSO FAILED THE TENDED TO BE AT THE MOST. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTION SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS HERE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- IS THERE MOTION. SET SET HERTZBERG MOVES THE BILL ALL RIGHT- BEFORE WE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS THIS PROGRAM WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT TENANTS WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BASICALLY PROVIDE TENANTS AN OPPORTUNE RICH THEMSELVES OF THE EXPENSE OF THE LANDLORD.

FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY AND FOR GETTING THIS EXPEDITED SO ARE MY WITNESS CAN STILL BE HERE- HERE THIS BILL TODAY FOR MEN AS WELL AS A FEW OTHERS- AND SO FAR THIS YEAR COMMITTEES I'VE TRIED TO PRESENT. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM CONTINUE OF CARE. PACKAGE OF BILLS. SO AGAIN THIS CARE THIS THIS BILL IS NOT IN ISOLATION FROM ANY OF THE OTHER BILLS. WE'VE BEEN PRESENTING WE THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM AND NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE COMPONENT IN ISOLATION- THIS IS HAPPENING ALSO IN HISTORIC BUDGET INVESTMENT- JUST GIVE ME. A CALL BECAUSE MAYBE WE TALK MORE ABOUT INVESTMENT SHOULD BE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN. TRACTION WORK FORCE. AS WELL AS HOUSING- AND I THINK IT'S WE ALL AGREE THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS I DON'T NEED TO KEEP ON HARPING ON THAT- BUT WE ALSO KNOW IN IN THAT AND THE ONE PART OF OUR SYSTEM THAT. SOMETIMES IS MORE CONTROVERSIAL THAN OTHERS IS THE- THE LPS. AND I JOINED OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES LAST YEAR WHEN THEY DID A- IT WAS ON IT AND THEN- PRESENTATION OF SAID AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND I WAS ABLE TO- ENGAGE IN THAT- INTO THINGS THAT WE TOOK AWAY FROM THE STATE AUDIT WAS. ONE WE NEED TO MORE ABOUT HOW OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING. AND YOU HEARD ME PRESENT A BILL LOOKING AT DATA GATHERING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND TO THERE APPEARS TO BE A VARIATION FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY ON HOW WE TERM AND LOOK AT. DANGEROUS AND. DANGEROUS MISSING GRAVE DISABILITY. SO WHEN CARE IS NOT AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN. LOCKED UP IN JAILS- DID. CORONER'S OFFICES- ABUSED ON THE STREETS- AND END UP IN OUR HOSPITAL ROOMS AND TAKING UP. A LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE OUT THERE. RESPONDING SB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD ALLOW FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE WITH ALL OF THE EXISTING DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IS SOMEONE IS SO. MENTALLY ILL AT THE POINT OF THEIR VALUE TO THE CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE. TO THE POINT THAT THEY ARE AT SUBSTANTIAL. RISK OF BODILY HARM. DANGEROUS WORSENING OF ANY RELATED SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS. OR SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC. DETERIORATION RIGHT SO THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU SEE SOMETIMES AND YOU THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD DO SOMETHING. COULD BE SITTING IN THEIR OWN FECES COULD BE BANGING THEIR HEAD AGAINST THE WALL COULD BE AS I'VE- REGULARLY HAVE TO CALL NINE ONE ONE ON MY WAY TO WORK DRIVING THROUGH BOTH. DOWNTOWN STOCKTON IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO THAT SOMEBODY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD- NOT NOT FULLY CLOTHED- IN CLEARLY TO SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY OTHER THAN ANYBODY WHO'S AROUND THEM IN TRAFFIC- IS THAT WHAT WE WANT FOR PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THAT IS. IS THAT OKAY BECAUSE SOMEBODY CAN SAY. I CAN SLEEP RIGHT HERE ON THE SIDEWALK OR I'M NOT GOING TO ACTIVELY KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW WE CLEARLY THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN. MEDICAL CARE. IS THIS BILL THE SOLUTION. NO IT'S NOT- BUT IT IS ANOTHER PART OF THE COMPONENT AGAIN WE'RE TALKING VERY NARROWLY- IN ADDITION TO FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER. IF YOU ARE AT THE RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE YOUR ILLNESS NOT AND NOT JUST. YOU KNOW YOUR LIFESTYLE OR- YOUR POVERTY LEVEL OR NOTHING LIKE THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE MENTAL ILLNESS. IS SUCH THAT YOU CANNOT PROVIDE FOR YOUR OWN MEDICAL. CARE TO THE POINT THAT YOU ARE AT RISK OF SUBSTANTIAL BODILY HARM. DANGEROUS WORSENING OF ANY RELATED SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS. OR SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC. DETERIORATION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS. THE OPS SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANT GUARDRAILS THAT WE PUT IN IS NOT INTENDED AS A TOOL TO TARGET PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND THE WHOLE POINT. IS TO PREVENT THAT I KNOW THIS A DIFFICULT ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THIS ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND WE ALL AGREE ON FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND PART OF A WHO WE ARE. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SOMEBODY'S MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. PUTS THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS IN A SAFE. MANNER AND THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING- TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM- WE ARE WORKING ON ALL OF THE OF THE HOUSING. INFRASTRUCTURE THE- WORK FORCE- AS WE SPEAK AND THIS HAS TO BE IN CONJUNCTION WITH IT. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THE BILL IS DR ALEXIS SEGAN AND- RANDALL HAGAR. ALL RIGHT- DR SEGAN. DOCTOR SEASONS HERE THANK YOU SEE GONZALES FONG YES- DR C. CAN GO AHEAD.

GOOD AFTERNOON CAROL ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF STOCKTON SUPPORT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- CANNELLA STIR THE OPPOSITION I HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MATT GALLAGHER AND COMPUTER- I SEE MISS PETERSON APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KIM PETERSON I AM AN ATTORNEY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND I FOCUS ON LEGAL ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US TO BE HERE TODAY I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND BEFORE COMING TO THE R. C. I SPENT TEN YEARS REPRESENTING ON PEOPLE- WHO ARE INVOLUNTARILY HELD ON FIFTY TO FIFTY HOLDS AND THEIR CERTIFICATION REVIEW HEARINGS SO. I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS OF LPS AND EXACTLY WHAT THE LEGAL PROCESS ENTAILS AND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE. WHAT IT IS LIKE TO OBSERVE PEOPLE BEING ON HOLD IN ACUTE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNITS. THE AUTHORS AND SPONSOR THE OTHER SPONSORS OF THIS BILL STATE THAT EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED AS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CARE AND DIGNITY TO THE MOST DIFFICULT TO REACH CALIFORNIANS. AND IN TURN STOP THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATION AND HOSPITALIZATION NOT SO MANY PEOPLE FACE. HOWEVER EXPANDING THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO INVOLUNTARILY DETAIN PEOPLE WILL DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING SOCIETAL CAUSES OF THIS CYCLE. WITHOUT REQUIRING THE STATE AND THE COUNTY IS TO ACTUALLY MAKE AVAILABLE HOUSING AND INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED UPON DISCHARGE FROM SHORT TERM LPS HOLDS AND CONSERVATORSHIP. THE CYCLE WILL PERSIST. AS DISCUSSED IN OUR LETTER A RECENT UCLA STUDY SHOWED THAT PLACING ON HOUSE PEOPLE ON LPS HOLDS LEADS TO LONGER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE AT THE TIME THAT THEIR WHOLE BEGAN. AND ALSO LEADS TO A GREATER THAN 50% CHANCE THAT A PERSON WILL REMAIN ON HOW IS THAT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRST HAND IN MY PREVIOUS WORK I REPRESENTED DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON HOW IS AND PLACED ON LPS HOLDS WITH THE HOPE OF GETTING. WITH SOMEONE HOPE OF GETTING THEM INTO TREATMENT BUT THEY WIND UP LINGERING IN THE HOSPITAL FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN DISCHARGED BACK INTO HOMELESSNESS. IN COMPARISON A RECENT UCSF STUDY SHOWS THAT LINKING ON HOUSE HIGH UTILIZE THERE'S A PUBLIC SERVICES TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND INCREASES THE RATE OF INCREASE OF OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH. VISITS AS WELL. THIS STUDY SHOWS A VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS CAN KEEP SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HOUSING GAINS WITHOUT RESTRICTING THEIR LIBERTY. THANK YOU MISS PETERSON IF YOU COULD WRAP UP YES- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT- CALIFORNIA AS WELL DOES NOT HAVE THE DATA TO SUPPORT EXPANDING INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IN THE STATE AND ANY EXPANSION. OF INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY DATA AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. ODD NEXT MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW GALLAGHER ATTORNEY FORMER PROSECUTOR. ON BEHALF OF CAL VOICES. THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS REALLY OUTLINED ON PAGES THIRTEEN THROUGH SIXTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS. IS SB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN AS DRAFTED UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE AND OVERBROAD. WE BELIEVE IT IS. WE LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE AS DRAFTED. THE QUESTION IS WILL PROPOSE CONSERVANCY BE ABLE TO READ THE STATUTE AND UNDERSTAND THAT. WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL. WE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE. SUBSTANTIAL BODILY HARM. DANGEROUS WORSENING OF ANY CONTINENT SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC DETERIORATION. THESE ARE NOT THE FINE WEAGLE STANDARDS THEY'RE NOT DEFINED IN THE STATUTE THEY'RE NOT DEFINED ANY APPELLATE CASE LAW. IN QUITE SIMPLY INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATORSHIP FOR OPS HOLDS WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THESE WHAT CONDUCT OR FOR BEHAVIOR. THIS LANGUAGE PROHIBITS OR ALLOWS. AND WHAT'S MORE CONCERNING IS THAT JURORS AND JUDGES WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY THESE LEGAL STANDARDS. SO ASSUMING AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUBJECT TO HELP YES HOLD EVENTUALLY MAKES HER WAY TO A CONSERVATORSHIP AND THEY OFFER A TRIAL YOUR WITH THE JUDGE OR JURY. JUDGES INJURIES WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY THESE LEGAL STANDARDS IT'LL CREATE INCONSISTENCIES. OF COMPLETE LACK UNIFORMITY IN CASES WILL BE DECIDED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WITHOUT ANY CONSISTENCY. THAT WE BELIEVE RUNS A PHALLIC DUE PROCESS AND CONSTANTLY CONSTITUTIONALLY PRECISE SIZE WELL SETTLED LEGAL PRECEDENT. AND AS I CLOSED I AND WITH THIS COLD COMFORT. WHEN THE UNDERLYING SUBSTANCE OF THE LAW IS OVERBROAD. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER WE LOOK FORWARD YOUR SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW TO NARROW THE LANGUAGE ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WHO ARE PRESENT HERE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED GOOD AFTERNOON GLENN BACKUS ON BEHALF OF A CO YOU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU OTHERS HERE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED SEEING NONE ON THE PHONE LINE.

MY NAME IS JEANETTE BELL AND I AM IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SURE WE HAVE NO NIELSEN SHOULD THE TIME. ALREADY THANK OU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK HERE TO. THE HEARING ROOM QUESTIONS. COMMENTS NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- CENTER. SURFBOARDS. SECOND TIME'S A CHARM SO. OF. NINE SIX FIVE FIVE IT TENDS TO- TO DECIDE TO ALLOW WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE HEARSAY AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS THE COMPELLING NEED FOR THESE MEDICAL RECORDS TO BE TO BE GIVEN THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION. WHY WHY CAN'T WHY CAN'T- INDIVIDUALS BE BROUGHT IN- UNDER OATH THURSDAY IN SOME OTHER FASHION. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEIR TESTIMONY TO BE AS FORMULAIC AS ANY OTHER TESTIMONY. I CAN I CAN MAKE IT BETTER I WAS I WAS A MILITANT MR MAS ANSWER THAT. YES HAPPY TO LEE AND YOU MUST HEAR- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A REALLY ALIGNING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE WITH THE WAY THESE HEARINGS ARE CONDUCTED AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING PHYSICIAN EXPERT WITNESSES TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN DURING THEIR TESTIMONY WHAT THOSE POSITIONS HAVE RELIED UPON IN MAKING THEIR DECISION REGARDING SOMEONE'S TREATMENT PLAN OR WHETHER SOMEONE IS GRAVELY DISABLED. AND E. EIGHTY PHYSICIAN IS RELYING ON MEDICAL RECORDS REALLY HAVE TO RELY ON MEDICAL RECORDS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE TREATMENT AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN- THE INFORMATION THAT THAT POSITION READS. AND THAT THAT THAT POSITION IS RELYING ON RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT PERMITTED- THAT- IS THE AFFECT POST- PEOPLE B. SANCHEZ. SO YOU HAVE A DOCTOR WHO'S RELYING ON VERY- CREDIBLE AND- INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED AND DOCUMENTED WITH THE UP MOST OF CARE BY OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THAT DOCTORS NOT ALLOWED. PLAINTIFF DOES. IN COURT AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS- YOU KNOW REALLY HAS THE EFFECT OF THE COURT NOT HAVING THE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONDITION. THE PROBLEM WITH THE- YEAH IT IS ONE CLARIFY SO IMAGINE. AN EXPERT WITNESSES HE'S CALLED IN TO TESTIFY IN AN EXPERT WITNESS IDENTIFIES- MAYBE YOU HEAR SHE WAS PRESIDING POSITION IN SOME CAPACITY. RELYING ON. THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO EXPLAIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL RATIONALE FOR HOW THEY ENGAGE IN A COURSE OF TREATMENT OR OVERSIGHT. THAT IS WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW TO EXPLAIN WHAT IN HOW AND WHY THEY WERE DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT IN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THEY CAN TAKE THAT ONE STEP FURTHER IN SAY THAT DR JONES WAS RELYING ON DR SMITH'S- REPRESENTATION IN THIS REPORT BECAUSE HE THAT DOCTOR JONES BELIEVES THAT DOCTOR SMITH WAS MAKING THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS BASED ON. CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS. IS THAT IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SPECIFIC CASE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT TREATMENT HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE OR MEDICATION AND IF THERE WAS A SAY AND OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST THIS WOULD BE THE MOST COMMON EXAMPLE IN MY VIEW AN OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST THAT HAS BEEN TREATING AN INDIVIDUAL FOR A PERIOD OF TIME- TREATING THIS INDIVIDUALS CHRONIC. ILLNESS AND HAS BEEN CHARTING THE TRUE STORY OF TREATMENT AND THE- HE AND KIND OF THING THAT THE KERR EITHER THE CURRENT TREATER WHO'S TESTIFYING OR PERHAPS IT'S A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST THAT'S TESTIFYING THE NON TREAT- COULD READ THE INFORMATION AND- PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF. HIS OR HER TESTIMONY THEY'RE NOT LISTING TO THE POOREST OF THE AMAZED. IN THE RECORD THERE SIMPLY ATTESTING TO WHAT THEY RELIED UPON FROM THE RECORD. THAT'S CORRECT. ALL RIGHT. WHAT SEMI CASKEY PICKING UP ON WHAT- CENTER BORCHERS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE JURY OR THE JUDGE STILL IS ABLE TO WEIGH THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THAT EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE ALL WE'RE DOING IS SAYING THE EVIDENCE COMES IN BUT THE PROBATIVE VALUE WHETHER IT'S- ONE OR A HUNDRED. ARE YOU YOU KNOW THE FACT FINDER IS ALWAYS PERMITTED TO WAY SORT OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE BEING PROVIDED AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EXPERT WITNESS FOR THAT MATTER.ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS SEEING NON. RIGHT SENT SCISSOR MOTION SOME OF THE BILL CYNICAL ALMOST THE BILL- WOULD LIKE CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN INCIDENT WE'RE JUST YOU FOR THIS WOULD BE LIKE READ A DOCTOR'S GETTING READY TO TREAT YOU THEY LOOK IN YOUR RECORD. YOU CAN CHECK FOR THE SAME THING FIVE TOP TIPS YOU'VE HAD A SERIES OF MEDICATION THAT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN A PIC HE WOULD WANT THAT PERSON IT WILL TAKE THAT INTO. ACCOUNT WHEN THEIR YOUR OWN TREE PLAN WILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE AS THE IN THE MAP READ. AS AS THAT PERSON AND BEING ABLE TO- PRESENT BUT ISN'T. WILL NOT BE IN THE OFFICIAL REQUEST. BEING ABLE TO YOU. SOMETHING THAT THAT THE PERSON NOT WITNESS THEM SO. WE'RE YOU CAN DO UPON THAT TO MAKE YOUR CASE. BEFORE THE JUDGE. YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A COMMONSENSE ELEMENT TO THIS THAT ARE LIKE- I'D I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEANS BY WHICH- THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN. A BILLABLE TO THIS LEGAL PROCESS. WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN THE HEARSAY. PROTOCOLS MAY I MAY I RESPOND SO LET ME LET ME INTERVENE HERE JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THINGS SO MR MAS- WHAT WAS THE- QUESTION ONE WHAT WAS THE STATE LAW BEFORE THE SANCHEZ QUESTION. CASE AND QUESTION NUMBER TWO IS THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR EXPERT WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN A IN A- A MEDICAL EXPERT SAYS I NOTE WHICH PARTS OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS WERE NOTED ONE MORE THE GIRL. THAT LEXPERT CAN SAY BASED ON MY OBSERVATION AND BASED ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS I CAN. OFFER THE FOLLOWING OPINION WITHOUT CALLING THE PERSON WHO ORIGINALLY ANNOTATED THE MEDICAL RECORDS A MONTH AGO- MISSED US THE- QUESTIONS TO YOU. YES THOSE THEY DON'T BOB PRIOR TO SANCHEZ WAS THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS ENTERED SUCH THAT EXPERT WITNESSES COULD TESTIFY TO CASE SPECIFIC FACTS THAT THEY GOT FROM HERE SAY SO. IN THE EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EXPERT WITNESS POSITION COULD SAY I READ X. Y. AND Z. IN THE MEDICAL RECORD AND I ASKED IN ADDITION TO MY OWN OBSERVATIONS IS WHAT I READ RIGHT ON IN. MAKE MY OPINION THAT THE- ISSUE WITH IT DURING THE MONEY. SAN CHANGE THAT AND MADE IT SO THAT THE EXPERT WITNESS COULD NOT PROVIDE ANY CASE SPECIFIC FACTS TO BACK UP HIS OR HER OPINION OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT. THE PHYSICIAN- EXPERT WITNESS HAS ACTUALLY PERSONALLY OBSERVE THAT THANK YOU YOU MUST I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT- THE DUE TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT ARE GOING RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SENATOR EGGMAN OF FINISH YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN IF THERE'S A MOTION AND CALL FOR THE VOTE% EXPECTED LAST YEAR I'VE OF ART THANK YOU. OUR BARGAIN CENTER MOVE THE BILL- CHIEF IF YOU WOULD THE ROLL YEAH THIS IS THAT'S B. NINE SIXTY BY SENATOR EGGMAN WITH MY BY CENTER COVER YEAH OF THE MOST IS TO PASS AS THE- I'M BURKE.

SENATOR CORTESE FILE ITEM NUMBER- NUMBER. TEN SENATE CORTESE FILE NUMBER TEN. S. B. EIGHT THREE ONE. GO AHEAD CENTER CORTESE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME 2% S. B. EIGHT THREE ONE TWO TODAY. IT FOR US FOUR ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE A TALENTED CINEMATOGRAPHER LUSTER BIPV. ON THE SET OF THE MOVIE GROSSED ONE REVOLVER LOADED WITH A LIVE ROUND WENT OFF KILLING HER. AND INJURING ANOTHER. OF MOTHER WAS TAKEN IN A FAMILY FOREVER CHANGED SB THIRTY ONE BEGAN AS A RESPONSE TO THE TRAGEDY OF THE ROSE SAID. IT HAS EVOLVED THROUGH CISCO I HAVE HAD WITH UNIONS AND GUILDS REPRESENT WORKERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. INTO THE GROUND BREAKING LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES THE BROADER ISSUE OF OVERALL HEALTH AND SAFETY ON SETS. THE MAGIC OF FILM AND TELEVISION CAN OBSCURE THE DANGERS OF WORKING IN MOTION PICTURE. SHOULD IS OPEN OUTSIDE THAT IS AMBER SHOOTING SUBJECT TO ALL KINDS OF WEATHER AND TERRAIN CONDITIONS. THAT WERE WORKERS CAN BE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING FROM STANCE COMPLEX ELECTRICAL SET UP CAR CRASHES EXPLOSIONS ALL WHILE WORKING ON IN THE REGULAR HOURS. OTHER INDUSTRIES ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. WE ALL KNOW THAT OF THE VERY FEW HAVE AS MANY IT IS VERY THREATS. AND ALL IN ONE PLACE WHERE THE USE OF A FIREARM IS JUST PART OF ANOTHER DAY AT WORK. WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE TRAGIC INCIDENT SECURE WORKERS BUT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE ACCIDENTS. THAT CAUSED SERIOUS INJURIES AND CONSTANT NEAR MISSES. THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WIDE LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE HAS DEVELOP SAFETY BOLTON'S FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS INCLUDING USE OF FIREARMS AND SETS. BUT THOSE BULLETINS ARE NOT BINDING. WE'RE NOT BY ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS BUT ONLY RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES MANY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTIONS FALL THEM BUT MANY OTHERS PAY LIP SERVICE OTHERS ARE BOUND BY THEM AT ALL. THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY ON ANY SAID BUYS EMPLOYER. ACCIDENTS ARE PREVENTABLE IF SAFETY MEASURES ARE PRIORITIZE FOLLOWED AND ENFORCED. WORDSMITH A LACK THERE OF IS WHAT SB THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES BY TAKING A PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE APPROACH SB THIRTY ONE A SERVICE A CLEAR ENFORCEABLE SAFETY STANDARDS TO PROTECT WORKERS ON FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS. IT RESTRICTS THE USE OF LIVE AMMUNITION ON SET MANDATES SUFFICIENT STAFFING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WITH FIREARMS BROWN SAID IT REQUIRES ONLY. TWO SPECIFIC TRAINING QUALIFICATIONS MANAGE FIREARMS DURING PRODUCTIONS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BILL RECOGNIZES THAT ENSURING THE OVERALL HEALTH AND SAFETY ON SETS REQUIRES ON THE GROUND OVERSIGHT. THIS BILL REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO HAVE A TRAINED QUALIFIED SAFETY SUPERVISOR ON ALL PRODUCTIONS THE SAFETY SUPERVISOR WILL BE TASKED WITH CONDUCTING A PRE PRODUCTION RISK ASSESSMENT. IT WILL BE. DEBT EVERY DAY TO HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CAST CREW AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION. THE CONCEPT OF A SAFETY SUPERVISOR IS NOT SOMETHING NEW TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY PRODUCTIONS IN THE UK AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND ALL HAVE SAFETY OFFICER POSITIONS AND CONSULTANT POSITIONS AND BOTH THE US PRODUCERS IN UNION MEMBERS WORKING IN THOSE COUNTRIES. ARE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THEM. THE END INDUSTRY. CAME TOGETHER HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANKS IS US WE CREATED A COVERT NINETEEN PLAN. THAT INCLUDED COMPLIANCE SUPERVISORS ON THE SET FOCUS SOLELY ON COVERT RELATED HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ENSURE THE SAFE RETURN. TO WORK DURING THE PANDEMIC. SETS WERE NEVER THE SOURCE OF WIDE COVERT SPREAD. SO THE POINT IS. WE KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRIORITIZE HEALTH AND SAFETY YOU KNOW KEEP THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE IF THERE'S A WILL TO DO IT. BY CODIFYING PROVEN SAFETY MEASURES CREATED AN APPROVED BY THE INDUSTRY. IN REQUIRING A CRITICAL NEW SAFETY POSITION SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE SETS UP A FIRST IN THE NATION REGULATORY STRUCTURE FOR HER SAKE. AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. COLLEAGUES IT'S TO CALIFORNIA. THE HOME OF THE FILM INDUSTRY TO SET SRONG STANDARDS OF PROTECTION SO THAT TRAGIC ACCIDENTS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW MEXICO. NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND SO THAT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE THIS BILL MOVES US ONE STEP CLOSER. TOWARD THE SCHOOL. WITH US TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY ONE. TAKE A RIDE FROM THE NATIONAL. EXECUTIVE SHE IS THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS GUILD I OUT SEE LOCAL SIX HUNDRED NGOS OF READING FROM THE DIRECTORS GUILD OF AMERICA- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU ALREADY THANK YOU- MISS ROBIN ARE YOU ON THE PHONE.

SAFETY PROGRAM. THIS IS A FR JOB AND IT'S- IS THAN A FULL TIME JOB IS WE'RE ALL TO- TO WORK. LONG HOURS. AND TO PROVIDE A PERSONAL NOTE I EXPERIENCED SOME HEARING LOSS FROM EXCESSIVE BY AROUND A FELT. WHEN I WORKED IN AUSTRALIA AND THE FILM UNBROKEN. THE PRODUCTION WAS SUPPORTED BY A FULL TIME SAFETY SUPERVISOR WHOSE SOLE FOCUS WAS SAFETY. IT OPENED MY EYES TO HOW SAFETY CAN BE DONE BETTER AND RELIEF TO BE APPOINTED BY BAKER WERE EACH. I'LL SOON BE WORKING WITH THE U. K. SAFETY SUPERVISOR ON THE FILM AND SO FERRARI. WHICH WILL BE FILLED THAT ITALY ARE NOT UTILIZED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. DESPITE INDUSTRY SHAKE PEOPLE UP IN STUDIO CITY DEPARTMENTS IN THE BEST EFFORTS OF A SHAKY CATCHES CREW AFFORDABLE ACTION STILL OCCUR. ASSISTANT DIRECTORS ARE ASKING FOR KNOWLEDGE PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN COORDINATE WITH US IN REAL TIME I DAY TO DAY SAFETY ISSUES.

FOUR YEARS AGO IT FIRST SB TWO OH SIX FAIR PAY TO PLAY- FOR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS IN- UPDATING IT- LAST YEAR WITH SB TWENTY SIX ARM FORTINO ONE LOOKS AT SPORTS GENERATE LARGE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND WHERE THE ATHLETES RECEIVE ONLY THEIR SCHOLARSHIP AND RETURN AND WHICH AMOUNTS TO A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL REVENUE THAT IS GENERATED FROM THAT RESPECT TO SUPPORT. COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S BOWL VISION ONE MEN AND WOMEN BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE PREDOMINATELY AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND ARE THE ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES IN THE STATE WE DO NOT RECEIVE AT LEAST 50% OF THE REVENUE. THAT IS PRODUCED BY THEIR SPORTS LAST YEAR THE SUPREME COURT. ROAD UNANIMOUS FROM UNANIMOUSLY. IN THE N. C. A. A. VERSUS AUSTIN RULING THAT TO IN SITU WAY. I WAS ACTING IN VIOLATION OF THE ANTITRUST LAW BY LIVE ANY EDUCATION RELATED COMPENSATION THAT ATHLETES RECEIVE. THE IN SITU A STILL RESTRICTS COMPENSATION THAT SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE DIRECTLY TO THEIR ATHLETES RELATED TO THEIR EDUCATION. AND THIS CONCURRING OPINION ON THIS CASE JUSTICE CALVIN ALL STATED. THE IN SITU ES AND ITS MEMBER COLLEGES ARE SUPPRESSING THE PAY OF STUDENT ATHLETES WHO COLLECTIVELY COLLECTIVELY GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUES FOR COLLEGES EACH YEAR. BUT TO STUDENT ATHLETES WHO GENERATE SALES REVENUES MANY OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND FROM LOWER INCOME BACKGROUNDS END UP WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL THE BILL IS SET UP A DEGREE COMPLETION FONG TO ENSURE THAT FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE REVENUES GENERATED IN THOSE SPORTS GOES BACK TO THE ATHLETES TO INCENTIVIZE GRADUATION A SISTER COSTA LIVING DURING COLLEGE AND GIVE BACK A FAIR SHARE OF THE REVENUE THAT THEY GENERATE. THE AMOUNT DEPOSITED IN FOREIGN FUND IS CALCULATED BY SUBTRACTING THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANT. IN AID IN SCHOLARSHIP IN THAT SPORT FROM 50% OF THE REVENUE GENERATED BY THAT SUPPORT THE DIFFERENCE IS THEN DIVIDED AMONGST EACH ATHLETE IN THAT RESPECT TO SUPPORT. AN ATHLETE HAS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE FUNDS UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ACTED OUT THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND SHALL RECEIVE THE BALANCE OF THEIR FUNDS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF GRADUATING. AS LONG AS THAT DEGREE IS COMPLETED WITHIN SIX YEARS WE ARE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSE AND STAKEHOLDER NOT SEVERED THESE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SUCH AS WHAT CONSTITUTES REVENUE. PROTECTING AGAINST EXISTING SPORTS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND DETERMINING HOW MUCH AND WHEN IS APPROPRIATE FOR AN ATHLETE TO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR FUN WHILE STILL ENROLLED. ULTIMATELY WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT WITH ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. AN ATHLETE SHOULD CHEERING ANY OF THE- THE PRODUCE BUT WE WANT- THIS BILL TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE INSTITUTIONS FAIR TO ATHLETES IN CAPTURING ONLY THE REVENUE THEY GENERATE AND NOT DETRIMENTAL TO ANY OTHER SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE- OTHER MORE POPULAR SPORTS. TO THAT END THE COMMITTEE HAS ALSO RAISED A CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL SIMPLY SIMPLE IMPLICATIONS IMPLICATIONS WHAT CAN READ TODAY AS IT PERTAINS TO A TITLE NINE REQUIREMENTS NOT TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF SEX WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT- THAT THE WAY THIS IS FUN OPERATE AS NO DISCRIMINATORY- AND AIMS TO PROVIDE ALL ATHLETES WITH 50% OF THE REVENUE GENERATED I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING.

GOOD AFTERNOON ALEX GREAT THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES- AND R. EIGHTY MEMBERS INCLUDING TEND TO COMPETE AT THE DIVISION ONE LEVEL- WE ARE- WITHIN MINUTES RIGHT NOW MOVING. TO IN OPPOSE POSITION. MISTER JERRY HAVE NO ONE ELSE INTO IT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK- TO THE DAIS ANY- COLLEAGUES SIR WHAT CASTING. I'M I'M ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE OTHER ATHLETES THAT PARTICIPATE IN. ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITY AND WHAT THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT IS THE TITLE NINE SEPARATION OF YOU KNOW AN EDUCATION PROGRAM ANY EDUCATION PROGRAM SO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO WHATEVER THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS GOT. FOR TUTORING OR SOMETHING MENTAL- EDUCATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL EVERY OTHER PROGRAM HAD TO DO AND THEY MAYBE THEY DO I DON'T KNOW BUT THEN IT SAYS WERE. FOR ACTIVITY. AND THAT ACTIVITY MAY BE THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT ARE BE GIVE THAT WILL BE GIVEN TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND BASKETBALL PLAYERS IN THE SPORTS THAT RAISE A LOT OF MONEY. CAN YOU ANSWERED THAT IF HE SAID. HE SAID EACH UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHERE STUDENT WAS IN SCHOOL OR GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO GRADUATE WITHIN SIX YEARS SO THERE WILL BE EQUAL WOULD REQUIRE AGAIN. THE FIRM HERE IS UNFOUNDED BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING A PROFIT IS NO REVENUE TO BE SHARED TO BE PUT INTO THIS ACCOUNT FOR STUDENT ATHLETES TO BENEFIT FROM ITS ONLY THOSE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITIES ARE SURE ACTIONS. ARE ARE MAKING A PROFIT IF YOU'RE BREAKING EVEN WITH YOUR SCHOLARSHIP AND HOW WHAT YOU DO FOR ATHLETES WHETHER YOU'RE A FEMALE ATHLETE OR MALE ATHLETE WILL NOT BE IMPACTED AT ALL IT'S ONLY FOR THOSE REVENUE IT'S NOT. IT'S NOTHING TO BE SHE- IT'S A ZERO SUM GAIN IT'S NO. OF NO PROFIT BY THESE UNIVERSITIES BUT IF BUT IF 50% OF THE PROFIT LET'S SAY LET'S SAY THE THERE WAS. EVERYBODY GREET THE DAY YOU HAD TO PROVIDE WITH ALL THE ATHLETES. WITH COMPENSATION TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THEY GOT. IF YOU HAVE IF YOU REQUIRE. HALF OF IT TO GO TO THE JUSTICE STUDENTS- IN THE IN THAT ACTIVITY IN THAT SPORT. THERE MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH AROUND. ON WITHIN THE HIGH I WANT TO SEE THE SPORTS BUDGET THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S LOOK AT FOR YOU SEE. IF THAT'S ENOUGH BUDGET TO GIVE THOSE OTHER. OTHER STUDENTS THE SAME TREATMENT. I MEAN I MEAN I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU WE HAVE THIS HARD RULE THAT IF YOU'RE IN A SPORT AND THE WRITTEN GET REVENUE LET'S SAY IT'S IT THERE'S A NUMBER THERE IF THAT REVENUE CAN'T BE SHARED BECAUSE NOW THERE'S NEW REQUIREMENTS MINUTES STUDENTS NOBODY'S GETTING TWENTY FIVE GRAND TO GET TO GO TO SCHOOL AND BE IN ANY SPORT RIGHT IT MAY BE THAT THIS IT MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD OUTCOME- I JUST BROKEN. WITH THAT IS AYE AYES AYE READ. THE STAFF ANALYSIS ON TIELINE IN SAYING. AND SAYING IT'S THESE ACTIVITIES BESIDES JUST THE EDUCATION BECAUSE- THEY HAVE TO. YOU KNOW. HAVE TO TREAT THEM THE SAME. I GET THAT AND I GET TO CONCERNED ABOUT TITLE NINE I HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WERE. FOR COACHES- WELL I HAVE A COUSIN WHO'S A WOMAN'S VOLLEYBALL COACH. AND THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WOMEN'S SPORTS ARE NEGLECTED MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER ONES BUT AGAIN. THIS WILL NOT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON. WOMEN'S SPORTS ARE UNIVERSITIES IT WOULD DO NOTHING TO THEM IF THERE'S- EXTRA RECORD REVENUE THAT CAN BE SHARED. THE ONLY STAND TO GAIN FROM THIS PROGRAM. IF THERE IS PROFITS TO BE MADE AND IT'S- ABOVE AD BEYOND THE TWENTY FIRST. I LET'S LET'S SEE EVERY ATHLETE GOT. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM. AND THEN WITH THE EXTERIOR. STANDARD THOUSAND. LEFT OVER. WE WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGES. FUND ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR WOMEN'S SPORTS OR THOSE NON REVENUE WHETHER IT'S WRESTLING. OR BADMINTON WHAT WHATEVER I MEAN THOSE SPORTS GENERATE NO REVENUE- OFFER COLLEGES BUT THESE ARE SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES NONE THE LESS. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING MISTER CHAIR HE SAID. I MEAN I. SORT OF HAVE GROWN UP. NOT THAT I'M GROWN UP NOW BUT AS I WAS GROWING UP. HE SAID THAT HE SAID. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL SUBSIDIZED ALL THESE OTHER SPORTS I JUST SORT OF. ASSUMED THAT THEY GENERATE MONEY. AND NOBODY WENT TO A BASEBALL GAME AND- THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT STUFF. SO YOU'RE- YOU. YOU'RE TALKING PROFIT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU PAY FOR THAT. THOSE EXPERTS CURRENT EXPENSES THAT YOU HAVE NOT YOU JUST. SINGULARLY LOOK THAT ONLY. EXPENSES FOR FOOTBALL. YEAH WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE NOT AWAY ANY OF CURRENT FUN THAT ACROSS THE BOARD YOU WILL SEE FOR EXAMPLE TOTAL SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ATHLETES IT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND COMPOSITION COACHES BUT TWELVE OF TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. OUR PROGRAM WOULD NOT TOUCH THAT IT WOULD ONLY ADD TO THAT FOR THE ATHLETES BENEFIT BUT USC GIVE ME A FANTASY TOUR THE OTHER DAY. AND I ASSURE YOU THERE PROGRAM RIVAL SOME PROFESSIONAL SPORTS PROGRAMS AND THEY WERE SHOWING ME WHY THIS BILL WAS UNNECESSARY BUT I WALKED AWAY SAYING THIS BILL IS EVEN MORE SO I'M EVEN MORE SO COMMITTED TO THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THE MAJORITY OF COLLEGES DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AT USC YOU KNOW HOW THOSE TYPE OF FACILITIES THEY DON'T HAVE THE PSYCHIATRIST AT THE INTRODUCED ME TO AN ALL BOYS AND EVERY COLLEGE IS NOT BENEFITING FROM THAT SO WE'RE SEEING. IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL REVENUE. THAT'S INCENTIVIZE THOSE ATHLETES NOT ONLY TO STAND SCHOOL BUT TO GRADUATE AND THAT'S- WHAT ARE YOU SEE IF IT'S NO PROPERTY BE SHARED IT'S NO HARM HERE RIGHT I GUESS I'M- LOOKING AT AND LOOKING AT. THE FUNDS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS THAT SO THEY SUCCEED IN COLLEGE AND WE USE THAT EXAMPLE HERE IS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT I WOULD THINK THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO. GIVE THAT TO ALL. STATE WHETHER THEY'RE ON BADMINTON WRESTLING SO THAT THEY SUCCEED ALSO SAID THAT HAVE EQUAL TREATMENT THE ACTIVITY IS THE SAME. I'M NOT TAKEN OPINION NOT AND I GUESS I JUST SPOT THE ISSUE GOT. SIR CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR SO FOR ME TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT- RULES YOUR MIND THAT. THIS IS A SCHOOL SET- UTILIZE STUDENT ATHLETES AS PART OF THEIR PROGRAM. THEY THEN DON'T GRADUATE THOSE STUDENT ATHLETES PARTICIPATING BEYOND KIND OF THE REGULAR SEASON BECAUSE I FEEL REALLY STRONGLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES ON NOT TOO MANY OF THEM CALIFORNIA BUT BUT THERE ARE NUMBERED THEY GRADUATE. THEIR ATHLETES RIGHT- AND- IT'S PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THEIR ATHLETES OF COLOR ARE EVEN WORSE OFF THAN THAT- SO I'M SUPPORTING OF YOUR GOAL OF THE BILL THE ISSUE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A ALONG WITH- WHAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE SAID IS- AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL. IS THAT THE SPORTS. IN THE SPORT THAT GENERATES THE REVENUE. GETS THE REVENUE FOR THEIR ATHLETES. AND THAT'S THE SPLIT AND IF YOU'RE IN A SPORT THAT IS A NON REVENUE GENERATING SPORT- THEN YOUR ATHLETES ARE NOT GONNA BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE MONEY THERE WILL BE REVENUE THERE WON'T BE EXCESS REVENUES IT'S HIM I AM AM I CORRECT THAT'S THAT'S ACCURATE ASSESSMENT I MEAN IT'S FOR THESE ATHLETES WHO ARE GENERATING THE REVENUE BUT- BENEFITING. SO AGAIN. GREATER INCENTIVIZING THEM BY SETTING MONEY ASIDE AND HOPING THAT THEY GRADUATE BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE THE ONES WHO PUT -(*** IN SEATS WELCOME TO A BATMAN GAME I'M SORRY WELL IN FACT PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT YOU RUN INTO QUITE FRANKLY IS THAT WELL I SHOULD SAY NO ONE'S PAYING THE TICKETS ARE FREE TO THOSE GUYS YEAH WELL AND THAT THIS GETS AT THE CRUX OF IT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I I'VE GOTTEN A BUNCH OF COMMENTS. IN OPPOSITION FROM PEOPLE THAT- WORK IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- AND I THINK THE ISSUE REGARDING TITLE NINE IS THAT- MANY OF THAT WOMEN'S SPORTS PROGRAMS ARE FREE TICKETS- AND THEY DON'T GENERATE REVENUE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO THE AN EQUAL YOU KNOW- ISSUE. IT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE RESOLVED AT SOME POINT I JUST THINK IT'S GOT TO BE RESOLVED AND IT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. WERE AND I REALLY LIKE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS I WENT I WENT STUDENT ATHLETES TO GRADUATE- AND I AND I WANT THERE TO BE A COMMITMENT. TO THE PROGRAM. THAT THEY THEY GET THEIR STUDENT ATHLETES TO GRADUATE I MEAN I THAT'S IT JUST IT'S- I THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTAL WHERE WE WHERE WHERE THE GOING TO COLLEGE THEN. AND WE'RE IT WE'RE JUST USING THEM AND THEN MOVING ON RIGHT. AND I AND I GET IT BUT I BUT I DO THINK THERE'S GONNA BE SOME. SOME EQUITY ISSUES AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR IT LIKE I SAID I'M GOING TO. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE- IF. WE WHILE I DO WANT TO SUPPORT THEM THE ATHLETES THAT ARE IN THE REVENUE. GENERATING CATEGORY ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT THEM THE ATHLETES. THAT ARE NOT IN THE REVENUE GENERATING PROGRAM TONIGHT I THINK THE- FOR WOMEN TO BE. EQUALLY TO MEN IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT. TERRIFIC TO SEE THE WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM FINALLY GET PAID FOR SOME STUFF THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT. THEY'VE BEEN UNDER COMPENSATED SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SO- I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER- DRAWS A YEAH- JUST TO REITERATE- THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT. COULD IMPACT WOMEN AND- WE NEED TO B. LOOK AHEAD AND NOT JUST SORT OF REACT TO THAT SO- BUT THAT WOULD THAT OF- COMINTERN'S SUPPORT THANK YOU AREN'T ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO COMMENT SEEING NONE- LET'S CALL THE ROLL. GOING TO CLOSE ALL SORRY YES BY ALL MEANS. AND IN ONE OF THOSE DAYS MAN NO I APPRECIATE IT AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN IN IN THIS BY NO MEANS WHAT ARE YOU CARRYING A BILL THAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA HURT. ANY SPORTS ESPECIALLY WOMEN'S SPORTS AGAIN I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE COACHING WOMEN'S TEAMS SO I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I'VE FOUGHT FOR FUNDING AT A UNIVERSITY ERASED DATA DID FUND RAISERS FOR WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS WHO ARE GRADUATED FROM SO I UNDERSTAND. WORDS OF THIS. WORST TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE IS AGAIN A REVENUE PULL FOR A PROFIT AND WHEN I SAID BATMAN AND I'M IT NO ONE. PIECE FOR BATMAN GAMES THOSE GAMES ARE FREE THOSE ATHLETES ARE ATHLETES ON THE LAST JUST AS SERIOUS AS SOMEBODY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS NOBODY'S WILLING TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS YOU KNOW AND ACTUALLY GIVE THOSE TICKETS AWAY SO I'M SEEING THOSE ARE NOT REVENUE GENERATING SPORTS BUT- SPORTS NONETHELESS ATHLETES THAT NEED TO BE RESPECTED AND PROTECTED. AND AGAIN THE BILL WILL HAPPEN IMPACT. STUDENTS ARE WHETHER THEY'RE MALE OR FEMALE AND AS I STATED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR IN A SHORT PERIOD. NAME INCH IMAGE. BIT ENACTED THEIR WOMEN ATHLETES WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LOCAL HOMETOWN HEROES AND- THE LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIP FOR THE STORE WANTS TO YOU KNOW SPONSOR THEM OR HAVE THEM ADVERTISE. OUR PRODUCTS SO THEY HAVE BENEFITTED THEY HAVE SIGNED WHAT CONTRACTS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF SINCE NAME AND MATURE- SO WE'RE UNDERSTANDING THAT. WE'RE GOING LOOK AT- NINE. ONE THING THIS BILL. MAY NOT DO IS HER TOP NOT IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM WOMEN'S SPORTS IF EVERYTHING WORKS WELL SB UPTICK IN THOSE REVENUES COULD BE SHARED ACROSS THE BOARDS ARE RESPECT US WE ARE ABLE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KIM PETERSON I AM ATTORNEY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND I FOCUS ON LEGAL ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY DRC OPPOSES THIS BILL BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO DATA UPON WHICH TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER EXTENDING THE FIFTY TO SEVENTY HOLD FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS. IS AN INTERVENTION THAT IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO SUSTAINED POSSIBLE. POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE SUCH THAT IT JUSTIFIES. THE INCREASE TIME. ANY DECISION TO ENACT LAWS THAT INFRINGE ON INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY CLEAR DATA AND NOT PRESUMPTIONS. LAST WEEK DRC AGREES WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WITHOUT WITHOUT DATA TO SUPPORT THE NEED FOR AN EXTENDED FIFTY TO SEVENTY HOLD THE STATE CANNOT SHOW THAT THE INFRINGEMENT OF LIBERTY IS JUSTIFIED BY A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST. IN HOLD SHOULD NOT BE AN ENTITLEMENT TWENTY TWO JUDICIAL REVIEW. IN CONCLUSION EXTENDING INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT DOES NOT RESOLVE THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL CAUSES OF REVOLVING DOOR HOSPITALIZATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. THREATS GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK AS FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN OPPOSITION. OTHER THAN ADEQUATE EVIDENCE THAT DETAINING PEOPLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS IS NARROWLY TAILORED AND THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST CONSISTENT WITH DISTRICTS SCRUTINY TEST FOR EVALUATING GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IMAGERY CONVENIENCE OF AVOIDING A CONSERVER HEARING IS INADEQUATE FOR JUSTIFYING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS OF INVOLUNTARY HOLDS THANK YOU THANK YOU- MODERATE DO WE HAVE A KIM PETERSON ON THE LINE. OR EXCUSE ME. ALL RIGHT MODERATOR LET'S MOVE ON TO THE PHONE LINES- FOLKS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE COULD- PLEASE IDENTIFY THEMSELVES BY NAME- FILIATION IMPOSITION. ANALYSTS KNOW HOW MANY ARE IN THE- DID YOU WISH SPEAKING OPPOSITION OF S. B. TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. WE SHOULD WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK ON TO THE DAIS. SIR WHAT% KASKY YOU'RE ONFIRE TODAY YOU KNOW I WASN'T GOING TO GO UP ON THIS BILL AND NOW. YOU'RE WITNESSES HAVE TRIGGERED SOME THOUGHTS IN MY MIND- BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE WE'RE LAWYERS AND WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF US ARE LAWYERS TALK ABOUT NARROWLY TAILORING TO LEAST RESTRICTIVE TO THE DID AS A LAWYER TALK THAT'S WE WANT. AND ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES CAN'T BE HERE BECAUSE SHE'S TREATING PATIENTS SO SHE HAS THIS OTHER JOB OTHER THAN GOING TO COURT AND TELLING US WHAT THE TREATMENT PLAN IS BUT YOUR OTHER WITNESS SAID THAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT FOR THE FOURTEEN DAY HOLD IN FOR THE THIRTY DAY HOLD ITS THIS OTHER THIS NEXT THIRTY DAY HOLD ALSO GOING TO INCORPORATE GOING TO. COURT SO THAT THE COURT FACT DOES HAVE JUDICIAL REVIEW BEFORE THEY AUTOMATICALLY GIVE YOU THE THIRTY DAYS THE THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS OUR INTENTION AND IF THAT IS NOT CLEAR WE ARE GLAD TO TAKE ANY AMENDMENT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT THE INTENTION OKAY SO THIS IS NOT. THE END AND THE COMPELLING STATE GOVERNMENT INTEREST FOR HOLDING THESE PEOPLE I THINK IT WAS ARTICULATED IS THAT YOU WANT TO AVOID CONSERVATORSHIP WHICH YOU BELIEVE IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN A SUCCESSFUL. MANAGEMENT PSYCHIATRIC POINT WHERE BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU PEOPLE CALL THAT ON THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY WE BELIEVE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN A FULL. SHIFT SO. WHAT MIGHT THE YOUR WITNESS WAS TALKING ABOUT. BEING THE MEDICATION RIGHT I MEAN IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT FORTY SEVEN DAYS THAT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH I'M GUESSING WOULD ACTED. WE GOT FORTY SEVEN RIGHT YEAH AND I FORTY THREE I THINK AS AS AS WITH YOUR HAGAR TALKED ABOUT- PEOPLE ARE COMING MORE ILL THAN THEY USED TO. EXTEND INTO THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR BEHAVE HEALTH ISSUES AND ALSO OFTENTIMES WITH COMORBIDITY SUBSIDY USE ANOTHER KIND OF MEDICAL ISSUES THAT THAT NEED. TREATMENT AT THE SAME TIME- I ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE EXAMPLE OF WE ALL HAVE FAMILY ISSUES WITH THIS RIGHT I HAD AN AUNT WHO HAD SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. MY COUSIN HAS FOR YEARS UNTIL SHE DIED AS LEICESTER GOD REST YOUR SOUL- SAID YOU KNOW MY MOM WASN'T SICK ENOUGH FOR YOU TO KEEP A FOR THIRTY DAYS. BUT SHE WAS SICK ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND GET RID. THE BE I. B. H. SO TO MY IN AND OUT OF THE- MY BECAUSE WOULD BAG PLEASE KEEPER OF THAT ADDITIONAL TIME BECAUSE THEN SHE CAN GET STABILIZED WHEN SHE CAN GET STABILIZE ON THE MEDICATION SHE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS BUT UNTIL THAT TIME. SHE WASN'T ABLE TO AND SO THE REVOLVING DOOR OF IN AND OUT IN AND OUT AND IN AND OUT THIS GIVES A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TIME TO GET PEOPLE STABILIZE BECAUSE SOMETIMES A MEDICATION MIX DOESN'T WORK EVEN IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE A. B. YOU MIGHT HAVE IT TAKES A CERTAIN MEDICATION TO BE ABLE TO TREAT YOUR YOUR SPECIFIC. THIS MISTER WHAT TYPE OF IT MEANS TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND FOLKS IN THIS FIELD SPEND IN COURT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO COURT FOR FOURTEEN DAY HOLDING YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING IN AND THEN A THIRTY DAY HOLD YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND YOU HAVE TO WRITE THAT REPORT YOU HAVE TO DO IT HOW MUCH OF THEIR TIME. IS SPENT ON. PROVIDING NARROWLY TAILORED EVIDENCE TO THE COURT ON THE SPECIFIC TREATMENT PLAN THAT YOU HAVE. VERSUS ACTUALLY. SEEING THE PATIENT DOING THE TREATMENT PLAN AND WE WILL HAVE PAPERWORK MORE THAN ANYBODY WOULD LIKE. RIGHT SO IT'S- BECAUSE- BECAUSE THAT'S DATA SEWER WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT AT THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA. BUT IF WE KNEW THAT THERE'S AND THEN. OF TOP THAT SPENT ON. WELL THE BALANCE OF TIME BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND WRITING IT AND THEN AND THEN HOW THAT WHAT THAT THIRTY DAY ADDITIONAL THIRTY GET A FULL NOTE BEFORE I CAME HERE PSYCH GET THE MEDICINES PRIDE PRIDE BALANCE THAT PER BECAUSE IT SEEMS THERE ARE. WAS THERE MORE STE EARLY- PHYSICALLY OF A SICKER OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE SICKER THAT IS JUST NOT FORTY SEVEN DAYS HIM AND WE'RE DONE- AND- DAN THE GOAL WHICH IS NORMAL OF AVOIDING THE- OF THAT SO. I FEEL BETTER NOW. THEN THEN I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE OF SAID THERE'S NOT ANY DATA AND YOU ALL KNOW WHEN WE VOTED FOR LAST WEEK AND LPS BUILT DATA AND ACTION WHERE PEOPLE FALL OFF AND ON OF OUR SYSTEM AND- WE ARE. HOPING TO. ALSO DO KNOW THAT MARIE COUNTY. DID A FIVE YEAR STUDY THIRTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS USE THIRTY DAY INTENSIVE TREATMENT ONLY TWO HAD TO BE REFERRED TO A MORE RESTRICTIVE- CONSERVATORSHIP. OF THE PATIENTS WHO WERE SUCCESSFULLY DISTRICT FROM THURSDAY TO TREATMENT READ DATE WAS LESS STIGMATIZING AND RESTRICTIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN IT GUARDIANS TO YOUR POINT MR WHITE HOUSE KEY REPORTED CHANGE THEIR WORKFLOWS ALLOWING THEM TO FOCUS MORE ON CONSOLES THAT THAT THAT TRULY. AND MORE EXTENDED PLACEMENT AND EVERYBODY OF COURSE. TO THE COST SAVING- FOR THE FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM CAN I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IS COMPELLING GOVERNMENT. MEMBER THAT COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST WITH THAT IN MIND. GIVING SOMEBODY'S MEDICATION RIGHT THAT PSYCHOTIC OR SCHIZOPHRENIC OR WHATEVER THE THIS IS THE- IS THAT IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY- OR TO THE GOVERNMENT TOURISTS THE STATE. YOU'RE GOING TO REPORT TO A PERSON'S WELL BEING. AND IF THE STATE HAS ANY INTEREST IN IN A PERSON'S WELL BEING- I MEAN I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY I'M A SOCIAL WORKER AND I COULD TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE THINK THIS WOULD ADD. ONE MORE LEVEL OF CARE. TO AGAIN AVOID THE MORE RESTRICTIVE. CONSERVATORSHIP. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER WORK ASKING CENTER STERN. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I GUESS I WOULD JUST A COMMENT TO ADD ON TO THE CONVERSATION AND THEN I'D LOVE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- I THINK THE OTHER DATA SET THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS AN AUDIT THAT I HELPED. UP HE IS BACK LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND I THINK SHASTA COUNTY- AND WE DO HAVE DATA ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INVOLUNTARY FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS WITH NO THAT'S IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS IN COUNTY ABOUT THE L. A. TEN THOUSANDS IN SALMON TO. I'M THE CAN SHIP THE CURRENT IS WAY TOO HIGH AND SO FOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE OTHER COMPELLING INTEREST HERE IS ACTUALLY A LIBERTY INTEREST IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO DO MORE TRUNCATED AND PRECISE. TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP STABILIZE PEOPLE AND THEN NOT HAVE TO BURDEN THE SYSTEM WITH THE LONGER TERM PROCEEDINGS YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER PEOPLE IN. BRITISH FOR THE VISIT. SO IN THE NEAR TERM. YOU MAY HAVE. SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT IS YOUR THREE DAY HOLD RIGHT NOW FRANK THAT THE THOSE THREE HOLES THE EVIDENCE WE'RE FINDING OF FIFTY ONE FIFTIES INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC FORCED HOSPITALIZATIONS WITH PERSPIRATION. THOSE ARE NOT- REPUDIATE INTERFACES WITH OUR SYSTEM I THINK GO IN A MONTH PERIOD WHERE YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE ABILIFY WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU IF YOU CONSENT TO IT OR OR OR END UP YOU KNOW SIGN OFF. THE ON A WEAK LONG. ACTING DOUBLE TO GET YOU STABILIZE AND MAKE SOME DECISIONS AND THEN YOU CAN START TO LOOK AT HOUSING OPTIONS AND ALL THE REST OF IT SO. I APPRECIATE YOU WE INTO. UP IMPORTANT AND TOUGH TERRITORY AND OF FOR ALL THE WORK BEEN DOING THIS YEAR I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE A CO AUTHOR. WELL BUT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL.

SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY FIVE L. A. COUNTY ABORTION ACCESS SAFE HAVEN PILOT PROGRAM. SB TWELVE FORTY FIVE WILL SUPPORT A FUNDED PILOT PROGRAM FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY ONLY TO BUILD ON THE STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE. THE PROGRAM WILL HOUSE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND PATIENT CENTERED COLLABORATIONS TO SAFEGUARD ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR PATIENTS COMING TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGARDLESS OF WHERE A PATIENT RESIDES. THIS YEAR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS REVIEWING A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION ESTABLISHED IN ROE V. WADE SHOULD THE COURT UPHOLD MISSISSIPPI'S BAN THEREBY OVERTURNING ROE PEOPLE IN OVER HALF THE STATES IN THE COUNTRY. OVER THIRTY SIX MILLION WOMEN AND OTHER PEOPLE THEY BECOME PREGNANT WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE. AND IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING PEOPLE IN TEXAS HAVE BEEN DENIED PROTECTIONS UNDER ROW SINCE THE STATE'S EXTREME ABORTION BAN SB EIGHT WENT INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO A REPORT RELEASED BY THE GUTMACHER INSTITUTE THE NUMBER OF OUT OF STATE PATIENTS WHO WOULD FIND THEIR NEAREST ABORTION PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA FROM FORTY SIX THOUSAND TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AN INCREASE OF NEARLY OVER A THIRD OF ALL ABORTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THE PREVALENCE OF ABORTION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN PARTICULAR LIKELY REFLECTS BETTER ACCESS IN THE CITY THAN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND QUITE FRANKLY EVEN OTHER STATES IN THE NATION THE COUNTY'S ROLE AS A MAJOR METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION HUB WITH MULTIPLE AIRPORTS. MAKES IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT NON RESIDENTS WILL COME TO L. A. COUNTY FOR THE ABORTION CARE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS. HOME STATE OR COUNTY. CURRENTLY L. A. COUNTY HAS ALREADY MADE EVIDENT COMMITMENTS TO HEALTH EQUITY THE COUNTY HAS A RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL INNOVATIONS IN CARE COORDINATION FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS MY HEALTH LA ECON SOLD SYSTEM LANES HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE NOW INFORMING CAL AIMS STATEWIDE EFFORTS. BUILDING UPON THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RESOLUTION OF BUILDING A COUNTY WIDE RESPONSE TO THE POTENTIAL OVERTURN OF ROE V. WADE. SB TWELVE FORTY FIVE WOULD FIND AND SUPPORT A PILOT PROGRAM APPROACH TO CARE THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE IMPENDING NEEDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING ABORTION CARE. HE FUNDING AREAS FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM WOULD INCLUDE SERVICES THAT PRIORITIZE EFFORTS TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES STREAMLINED AND SECURE INFRASTRUCTURE TO COORDINATE CARE AND OTHER PATIENTS SERVICES. PATIENT ACCESS TO TOOLS TO EMPOWER PATIENTS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO CARE MEDICALLY ACCURATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TOOLS SPECIFIC TO COMMUNITY NEEDS WITHIN THE COUNTY. AND PATIENT COMMUNITY OUT REACH TO ASSESS OUNTY SERVICES. WHETHER MAURITIAN RIGHTS ALREADY A ROADING IN NUMEROUS STATES. IN THE FUTURE OF ROE V. WADE HANGING IN THE BALANCE NOW IS THE TIME TO PUT FORWARD INNOVATIVE INVESTMENTS IN ABORTION ACCESS WITH ME AND SUPPORT AS THE LINDA VASQUEZ CHIEF EXTERNAL OFFICER FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU- IS VAZQUEZ IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT AND THEN- COME UP WITH THAT NINA THINKING THAT VASQUEZ I AM TO KEEP EXTERNAL THIRD TALK. LOS ANGELES. THIS YEAR ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS RESTRICTIONS INTRODUCED IN FORTY ONE STATES IN OUR COUNTRY. WITH THREE ABORTION BANS BEING BACK RECENTLY ENACTED IN ARIZONA IDAHO AND WYOMING. FIVE AGAIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS HOME TO ALMOST 30% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION AND ACCOUNT FOR OVER A THIRD OF ALL ABORTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THE FACT COUPLED WITH THE COUNTIES WALL AT THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION HUB WITH MULTIPLE AIRPORT MAKES IT VERY HIGH WOULD LIKELY THAT NON RESIDENTS WILL COME TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR PORTION SERVICES CAFE DESPERATELY. NEED AND CANNOT ACCESS IN THEIR HOME STATE. AT PLANT HERE TO LOS ANGELES WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE AT NUMBER OF PATIENTS TRAVELING TO AND FROM OUT OF STATE WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS COMING TO WATCH FROM TAX THAT- IN FACT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL PATIENTS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED- VARYING ISSUES FROM CHILD CARE TO NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUNDS CAN'T TRAVEL- ONE PATIENT HAD EVEN. TRAVELED THE BROTHER FROM TEXAS TO LOS ANGELES. IF YOU'RE NOT YOU NEED TO LOS ANGELES BUT WITH THE POPULATION AND- AND A 3000% ARE PROJECTION FROM THE GUTMACHER INSTITUTE WE KNOW THAT MANY FOLKS WILL. COME TO GO AYE FINANCIAL AS- I HERE TO. FOR INFLUX OF. AT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS EXPRESSING THEIR COMMITMENT TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AGAIN. BUILDING UPON WHAT THE STATE HAS IS ALREADY DEALING. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY ONCE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS PAIRED TO KEEP THAT COMMITMENT TO BE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE HAVEN BY CREATING A PILOT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPANDED ACCESS TO ABORTION IN THE COUNTY. WE ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED HERE IN LOS ANGELES. THIS PROGRAM WILL ENABLE THE COUNTY TO TAKE MANY OF THE FACT STATEWIDE AFRICA THEY SAID- AND REALLY EXPAND ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO DO. WHY I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMITMENT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTIVE JEFF THAT IN THIS DIRE TIME IN PARTICULAR WITH THE- FIRST CITY AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR COUNTY.

AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING FIFTY THREE PREGNANCY HEALTH CLINICS CENTERS AND MATERNITY HOMES IN EVERYONE OF YOUR DISTRICT. AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRO LIFE VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SB TWO FORTY FIVE ALTHOUGH FACIALLY NEUTRAL WILL DESPERATELY IMPACT MINORITIES. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS HOME 228% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION AND ALREADY ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL ABORTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. MOST ABORTIONS IN LOS ANGELES ARE IN LOW INCOME HIGH MINORITY AREAS. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY GOOD MARKER INSTITUTE STATISTICS SHOW THAT BLACKS AND HISPANICS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN ANY OTHER RACE OR ETHNIC ETHNICITY TO HAVE AN ABORTION. WE AS A NATION CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT IGNORE RACISM IN OUR HISTORY. IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOUNDER MARGARET SANGER WITHIN ADMITTED WHITE SUPREMACISTS HER STATED PURPOSE WAS TO PROMOTE BIRTH CONTROL AND ABORTION FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. CENTER REFERRED TO BLACK AMERICANS IMMIGRANTS AND INDIGENOUS AMERICANS AS AND I QUOTE. HUMAN WEEDS RECKLESS BREEDERS WHO ARE. HUMAN BEINGS WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORN. DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND I AM NOT SAYING AND DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLY THAT THE AUTHORS OF PRO ABOUT ABORT BILLS TRAVELING THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE ARE RACIST NOR TO IMPLY THAT THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY PROMOTING A RACIST AGENDA. THANK YOU. HOWEVER NO MATTER THE INTENTION BY PLACING MORE ABORTION FACILITIES AND LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SB TWELVE FORTY FIVE UNDENIABLY FOLLOWS PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S EUGENIC ROOTS MARGARET SANGER WOULD BE THRILLED WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF PRO ABORT BILLS MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH ITS CAPITAL BECAUSE THESE BILLS WILL WIPE OUT FAR MORE BLACK AND HISPANIC CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT MANY OF THESE ABORTION BILLS EXPRESSLY TARGET BLACK AND INDIGENOUS OF COLOR FOR ABORTION SERVICES. THESE ARE BOARDED PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE BORN THANK YOU MISS BROWN WE SHOULD JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION- I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THOSE WHO SUPPORTER AUTHORED THIS MEASURES. ARE RACES BUT THE QUOTES YOU YOU GAVE US FROM MARGARET SANGER CLEARLY WERE RACISM WONDERING WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE THAT WELL THE GOOD MARKER INSTITUTE SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES AS PRIMARILY- RECEIVED BY PERSONS OF COLOR HISPANICS AND BLACKS IN ADDITION LOW INCOME. SO THE POINT IS THAT THESE ARE NOT WOMEN WHO ARE BEING OFFERED A CHOICE THEY'RE BEING FORCED INTO A DECISION THAT THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE CHOSEN AND THE FACT THAT THESE. LOCATIONS ARE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO THESE WOMEN THAT WE SHOULD TO ENABLE THEM TO HAVE A TRUE CHOICE RIGHT BUT I JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I JUST INTERVIEWED THEM TO BE QUITE RACES IS IMPLIES I'M GONNA VOTE AYE ON THE BILL'S APPLIES AT LEAST TO ME.

TALKING ABOUT THESE EQUITY ISSUES FOR THIRTY YEARS- AND THE GAP DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER. DOES IT YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED ON IT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GETTING THERE BUT- BUT IT'S A PROCESS AND PART OF THAT PROCESS IS SET. SHINING SUNLIGHT ON. WHAT KIND OF WORK PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW MUCH THEY'RE EARNING AND WHETHER OTHER PEOPLE SIMILAR SIMILARLY SITUATED ARE EARNING THE SAME AND I THINK THERE'S THIS THIS BELIEF IN THE COMMUNITY THAT MEN NEED TO WORK MORE THAN WOMEN AND SO THEY SHOULD GET PAID MORE AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OUR SOCIETY FIFTY YEARS AGO SIXTY YEARS AGO BUT IT'S NOT NOW- WOMEN NEED TO. WORK AT- MONEY JUST LIKE MEN DO AND SO WHEN I THINK YOU FOR TACKLING THIS- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. WITH THE OPPOSITION. TECHNICAL FIXES.

THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO OTHER QUESTIONS OTHER COMMENTS SEEING OF SIMILAR. I SHOULD'VE LET- CENTER ROSS'S COMMENTS BE THE CLOSE OF THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ONE THING YOU KNOW THE ONE THING IS THE ONE THING IS THAT- I JUST WANTED SOME CONTEXT ARE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WITH THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE MADE A THIS. THAT'S CON START IN FULL. THE WELCOME I'M- FROM THE COME. AND THE ARE STILL. KANNST RAISED BY OPPOSITION DO YOU THINK THERE ARE STILL PLACES THAT YOU COULD WORK TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE I THINK TAKE COULD BE A MESS. IF COMMITTEE ADDRESS. YOU THINK KERR THE- THE CONCERNS THAT AROUND SO I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS I TUCK ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BUT AS YOU HEARD OPPOSITION SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS. THAT THE OPPOSITION HAVE. THAT NO I CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND SEE IF THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE CAN WORK BUT WHEN OPPOSITION TELLS YOU AND YOU KNOW GOES ON RECORD SAYING THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS AND THEY WANTED DEAD I MEAN I HAVE TO STAND UP THEIR POSITIONS OR THAT WAS THE OUTLOOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT- SO THE COVER YOUR HIS MOVE THE BILL WHICH LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK TO THE AT U. S. CENTER. KIND OF MET WHAT AN AUTHOR. BUT I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES GO THROUGH WHEN THEY GET LOBBIED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ON BOTH SIDES ON THESE DIFFERENT. I'M THINK. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'VE ASKED MYSELF OVER AND OVER AND OVER IF SHARING THE TRUTH OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE ACT OF SHAMING AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS GOING PUBLIC WHAT THE REALITY IS I BELIEVE IS THE ACT OF SHAMING I THINK THE ACT OF SHAME COMES AND- I THINK THAT WILL NOT GO PUBLIC AND IT STARTS AT A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THEN GOES DOWN TO EAT WE GET TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EMPLOYEES. HE AT. A SENATOR I GET- MENTIONED WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO THIS BILL DOESN'T TELL SOMEONE TO PAY SOMEONE A CERTAIN SALARY OR CERTAIN WAGE THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND WHAT OVER THREE OR FIVE DECADES WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS PROBLEM AND THE MORE WE HIDE THE DATA. THE HARDER GOING TO PRESS TO ADDRESS THIS- AND SO CERTAINLY I ALSO WANT TO RIP. A LOT OF POSITION ROOM THERE ARE COME NOW THAT ARE BE COMPANY LIKE INTEL THAT IS OUR RELEASED THIS INFORMATION THERE ARE COMPANIES NATIONALLY AND IN THE STATE WHO ARE DOING IT ON THEIR OWN. BECAUSE THEY- AND THE- PLEASE. ABLE TO. YOU KNOW THE MAY- OF REALLY THEIR JOB IN THEIR WORK FORCE BY BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW DESPITE WHAT HAS BEEN SAID- AND REFERENCING BILLS THAT ARE NOT IN THIS COMMITTEE- OR IF THEY HAVE EVEN MADE IT. TO LAW I THINK IT'S ALSO IN INTO USE DATA TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS I'M SOMETIMES IN OUR WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY OH YOU SHOULD START JUST YOU KNOW ASKING FOR. THERE WERE AT AND IF THE JOB. RIGHT IT'S LIKE OKAY WELL THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REAL REGULATION THERE- IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW FASTENING IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WHEAT THIS DATA COMPANIES OF A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY REPORTING THE STATE IT'S JUST NOT PUBLIC. SO WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM. TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEIR- NO. FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE THIS AND WE ALSO ARE LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW FOLKS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO BE PARTNERS INSTEAD OF OPPOSING AND YOU KNOW AGREEING WITH THE STATUS QUO THAT WE DON'T WANT. TO PAY A YOU KNOW IN THE SAME LIGHT AT MEN AND WOMEN AND YOU KNOW AFRICAN AMERICANS AND I HAVE I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST INPUT.

MY BILL ALONE WON'T DO IT MY BILL IS REALLY ABOUT HAVING INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THESE COMPANIES. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOT A FEW CUPS OF YOU CALL THE ROLL THIS IS SENATE BILL ELEVEN SIXTY TWO BY SENATOR LEE MARTIN. WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR COVER YET ALL THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND IT. TO THE CAN APPROPRIATE. NUMBER I BORGIAS. BOARD IS NO AT ALL. VERY AT ALL I RUSSELL.

ELEVEN SEVENTY SEPARATE TO CONTINUE. NUMBER ABOUT HOW WELL I FOR AND- ARE SERVING COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO CAN. FROM HEALTHY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND- I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE LO FI BANK ACCOUNTS AND MORTGAGES OR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS WITH FARE RATES IT'S A POSITIVE THING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. IT INTO MANY PLACES ACROSS THE STATE SPECIALLY IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CONSTITUENTS NOT ENJOY. ACCESS AS WEALTHIER AND MORE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIED TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES BY PASSING THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT KNOWN AS THE C. R. EIGHT WHICH-ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE HOW WELL BANKS. ARE MEETING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES NEED TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. THE FEDERAL CRA IS NOT PERFECT AND ONE OF THE WAYS IF FALL SHORT IS THAT IT COVERS ONLY BANKS THIS MAY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN BANKS HOW MANY DID THE FINANCIAL. TIMES BUT FAST FORWARD TO TODAY HAVE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT EVAPORATED FOR HOW WELL THEY ARE SERVING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. YOUR NAME IN THE RECORD COMPANY AND A GREAT. TECH LENDERS. RECOGNIZING THIS GAP SEVERAL STATES HAVE ENACTED THEIR OWN FURY LAWS IN AN EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE A BROADER SECTOR FINANCE SERVICES JUST TO MEET THE NEEDS OF. COMMITTEES FOR IS CONVERSATION IT WEALTH GAP IS SOME OF US ARE FROM IF WE UNDER THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT GAP WHETHER IT BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE MONEY FOR A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE HOUSE OR WHETHER IT'S LIKELY TO HIGHER STUDENT LOAN DEBT OR HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD DEBT BUT THERE IS ALSO THE THING THAT MUST ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO INTERACTING WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I IS HEARING TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. DECADES OF BEING OFFERED STEPS STANDARD PRODUCTS IF ANY AT ALL. AND THOSE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IS NOT JUST OUR OWN GENERATION BUT ALSO THE GENERATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE US. ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE CREEPS ARE PREDICTIONS TODAY. THE FEDERAL DID NOT EXT. FOR RAY. IN AT THE- OF.

RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TODAY. WHILE FEW ARE FAMILIAR THE WORK OF DEATH REVIEW TEAMS THEY PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CREATING THE DATA AND RESEARCH ON THE CAUSES. OF DOMESTIC ABUSE RELATED FATALITIES WITH THE GOAL OF PREVENTING FUTURE SUCH TRAGEDIES. THAT THE REVIEW TEAMS ARE OPTIONAL FOR COUNTIES AND ARE COMPRISED OF. TEARS FROM BILL. ADVOCATE IN JUDICIAL GROUP PROVIDE A CONFIDENTIAL FORUM TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED DEATHS. HOWEVER CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY LIMITS THESE TEAMS TO ONLY INVESTIGATE AND RESEARCH SITUATIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE ABUSE THAT ACTUALLY RESULT IN DEATH- THIS IGNORES A INCREDIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF INCREDIBLY SERIOUS. MYSTIC VIOLENCE WHERE THE- PARTY CAME VERY CLOSE TO BUT DID NOT ACTUALLY SUCCEED IN PULLING THE SURVIVOR. ON TO MY LEVEL OR SEEN MANY STATES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTIGATING YOUR DEATH INCIDENTS AND EXPANDING THE ROLE OF DEATH REVIEW TEAMS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR A THIRD OF STATE LEGISLATURE LIVES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE PASSED US UP. THE RISING ARE THESE TEAMS. L. HELP USUALLY. IN AREAS LIKE THIS BUT HE- ARE OUTDATED LAWS ARE PREVENTING OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH THAT WILL CLEARLY HELP PREVENT FUTURE DEBTS. TO SUPPORT THE ROLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAMS PLAY IN PROTECTING SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE. WOULD AUTHORIZE TEAMS TO INVESTIGATE YOUR DEATH INCIDENTS AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. BILL IS IT THIS DOESN'T THINK TO EXPAND OR CHANGE CRIMINAL LIABILITY. ASSERTIONS OF OPPOSITION. TO ACTUALLY DOES NOT CHANGE A LOT SIMPLY EXPANSIVE BILITY OF- THESE REVIEW TEAMS TO REVIEW A BROADER ARRAY OF CASES.

GAIN THIS SEEKS TO ADDRESS A PERVASIVE- FORM OF ABUSE DEFINED HERE'S ECONOMIC PORTION WHICH AFFECTS. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALL TOO OFTEN. I AND IS ALSO FREQUENTLY WITH SENIOR CITIZENS AND FOSTER YOUTH. THIS ABUSE CAN LOOK LIKE IN THE FOLLOWING WITHHOLDING MONEY BEING A PARTNER AN ALLOWANCE- OF FORCING OR THREATEN A PARTNER TO FILE FRAUDULENT LEGAL DOCUMENTS OR SPEND CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF MONEY AGAINST THEIR WILL.

SUPP ACTIVELY SOUGHT DISCUSSED THIS AND FEEDBACK FROM OPPOSITION GROUPS AND WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS ALONG THE WAY THAT HAVE REMOVED OPPOSITION FROM VARIOUS GROUPS- WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE ON THIS MEASURE- THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT UP. TO THE MAX ISN'T A GREAT GROUP. OF THE BUTTE. READ AND PERNICIOUS. THAT COERCED DEBT CAN PREVENT PEOPLE KIND PRIMARILY WOMEN FROM LEAVING ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY THAT CAN END UP IN DEATH FOR THEM. I WILL TRY TO CREATE A NARROW EXCEPTION THAT ALLOWS THE SURVIVORS TO SKIP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY NOT ONE THAT IS RIFE WITH ABUSE- AND SWEET LOOKING FOR DESTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK TO TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO ALONG THE WAY YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT. I WITH ME ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY REMOTELY TODAY IS LEE FERRAN OF THE PUBLIC LAW FOUNDATION.

THEN FURTHER AT THE FINE ALREADY THANK YOU NOW LET'S TURN TO OPPOSITION- WE HAVE MR WILSON AND MR GOVERNOR HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM IN OPPOSITION DO SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROB WELLS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT YOU. APPLE OPPOSITION SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT FINANCIAL ABUSES DESTRUCTIVE WHICH IS WHY WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING REAL VICTIMS WITH REAL RELIEF IN A WAY THAT IS NOT RECOUNTED ON THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY NINE SEVENTY FIVE IS NOT A CALL VOTE THIS AND INSTEAD SUFFERS FROM NUMEROUS. MENTAL FIRST THE MEASURE TREATED PREDATOR WORSEN THE- SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE RIDGE NEW CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE NEW CRIME ACCORDING TO DEBT. WHERE THE CLAIM IS NOT THE PERPETRATOR THE CRIME BUT A PARTY WHO'S COLLECTING ON THE BALLOT DEBT. RELIEF TO THE DEBTORS IN THE FORM OF UNILATERAL CANCELLATION OF THE DEAD ITS ENTIRETY. YET ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION IS MADE. OUT OF A DRUG ADDITION IS ABSENT REQUIREMENT EVEN NAME THE PERPETRATOR EVEN THOUGH THE IN THE NATURE OF THIS CRIME INDICATES THAT THE USERS NOW. WHICH MEANS THAT THE PENALTY THIS CRIME IS ON THE LENDERS HAVE NO PATH WOULD BE. MADE WHOLE. A CREDITOR WOULD NOT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE INFORMATION REGARDING REGARDING A DEBTOR'S PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. NOR THE NATURE OF THE ABUSE IN ORDER TO REBUT THE PRESUMPTION. THE MEASURE STATES THAT ACCREDITORS NOT PREVENTED FROM ENFORCING A DEBT HOWEVER MERELY STATING THAT A CREDITOR. CAN COLLECT IS NOT GIVEN THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO SO. MANY GETS A PERPETRATOR AS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. THE MEASURE CONTAINS A MULTITUDE OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WHICH ARE LETTER EXPANSIVE POINT SUCH AS DESPITE THE RECENT AMENDMENT THE SCOPE REMAINS VIRTUALLY ENDLESS WITHOUT GUARDRAILS IN THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP CIRCUMSTANCES THAT QUALIFIED DEBTOR FOR RELIEF. AND THERE'S LITTLE NO PROTECTIONS FOR CREDITORS AGAINST COLLUSION AND FRAUDULENT CLAIMS WHICH MEANS BAD ACTS HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY MAKING FALSE ALLEGATIONS. MEMBERS SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE UP AND SPOTIFY CONTRACTS THE REVOCATION TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE BILL BE CREDIT WILL NOT BE SMALL ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BILLS HOPING TO HELP. FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST CONTINUALLY RIGHT TO OPPOSE SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY IMPLORE THE COMMITTEE AND THE PROPONENT TO CONSIDER OTHER SUCH AVENUE SUCH AS RE EXAMINE TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN WHICH JUST BECAME IN WHICH WE JUST BECAME ACTIVE. THIS JANUARY STARTING THE ANALYSIS. LEVERAGING THE VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND OR EXAM ONLY. PROBABLY TO THE USER I LOOK FORWARD HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THIS GOVERNOR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. CERTAINLY THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP RESOLVE- BUT THIS IS NOT A NARAL BILLS SUGGESTED BY THE SENATOR. OUR PARTICULAR CONCERN RELATES TO PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT IS CARS MOTORCYCLES THOSE. VEHICLES GENERALLY- AS THIS BILL IS DRAFTED UP PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE VEHICLES- BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO RECOVER THEM. THE AUTHOR ADDED PROVISION WHICH SAID YOU CAN FORCE A LEAD. IS NOT A TERM REFERENCING THE REPOSSESSION ACTIONS AT ALL. WHAT IT ALSO MEANS IS THAT AS THE QUARTER. AFTER A WHILE THE NOTICE OF INTENT WITH THE DMV GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE REPOSSESSION YOURS WHAT THE BORROWER IS DOING UNDER THE SITUATION IS RESCINDING THE AGREEMENT UNDER RECISION EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO SQUARE ONE. YOU HAVE THE CONTRACT CANCELLED THE VEHICLE THE PROPERTY GOES BACK TO THE LEGAL OWNER BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS HERE HERE THE LEGAL OWNER IS STUCK WITH THE BILL. WITH VERY LITTLE RECOURSE TO GET IT BACK BECAUSE AS MR WILSON MENTIONED THERE ARE NO PENALTIES ON THE PERPETRATOR HERE. THEY COULD COLLUDE TERRIBLE THING WITH THE VICTIM ALLEGED VICTIM AND JUST KEEP PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WITH THAT VEHICLE AND WE CAN'T GET IT BACK. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT BY ENFORCING THE LIEN CARE ACTUALLY LEAVING OUT OTHER FORMS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT IS. APPLIANCES FURNITURE THOSE ITEMS WE HAVE A SECURITY INTO. IN THOSE YES THIS YOU KEEP EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS AGAIN WE GO BACK TO THE NOTION THAT THE EXAMPLES ARE REFER TO CREDIT CARD DEBT OR KIND OF THEFT OF FUNDS WITH A PERSONAL PROPERTY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THIS BILL ENTIRELY AND THAT WAS REALLY GO A LONG WAY. OUR BURNS SO. THEY YOU MISTER. ALL RIGHT OTHERS THE ROOM OTHERS IN THE HEARING ROOM% IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE. PLEASE ENTER MEMBERS JAMIE HAVE WITH THE JACK AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN THE ROOM SEE NO ONE ELSE APPROACH MIKE FROM THOSE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION SB NINE SEVENTY FIVE THERE AT THIS TIME AGAIN IT'S ONE ZERO. YOU CAN GO TO LINE FOR ALL FIVE. BURKE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION ASKING OVER THANK YOU THANK YOU. NINE THREE SIXTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON THEIR NUMBER IT WILL BE ALL OVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK AND A LOT OF THIS IS A GIFT. THANK YOU. LINE FOR THIRTEEN. THE FOURTEENTH I WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK DURING THE COURSE OF TIME I AM BUT I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE COURT I AM KIND ENOUGH CONSIDERING IF YOU I'M HALF OF THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS THANK YOU BAY AREA LUMINA. OKAY. IF YOU WERE LINE FOR ALL FOUR. MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS PUT COSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDITORS ARE ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND LAST THREE NINETY SIX. ALL RIGHT AFTERNOON MISTER BURKE. NOW YOU CRAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ALSO INTERGRAPH OPPOSITION FOR THE RECORD PREVIOUSLY STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE. SENATE WHITE HOUSE KEEP. I'M SURE THE CREDITORS- BAR IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL FALL OFF THEIR SEATS WHEN I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE CAUGHT THEIR OBJECTIONS THAT THEY ARE RAISED- N. AND ALSO JUST NOTING THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU. PROVE IT WASN'T TO REST IF. THAT THAT'S THEIR WORK THAT'S NOT ARCHITECT OUR WORK BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW DO YOU MARRY. TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND IN NINE SEVEN FIVE AND I GUESS IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A JOINDER OF PARTIES RIGHT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE CREDITORS INDEED TV ACTION AT THAT THAT THAT THAT. AT THE- UNDER GLORIOUS BILL BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABUSER IN THIS ACTION AGAINST THE CREDITORS AND IN THE DC PARTICIPANTS JOINT LIABILITY THEN YES YOU CAN GO AFTER CREDIT BUT IF IT'S JUST I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT IS JUST. IT'S JUST IT'S THE WIFE'S WERE THEY ABUSED UP CREDIT IT'S NOT THE- NOT THE ABUSERS HOW DO YOU JOIN THOSE OTHER THAN. ALLOWING IF YOU CREATING CAUSE OF ACTION ALLOWING FOR THE JOINING OF THAT THIRD. PARTY THAT'S- AGAIN I'M I'M I'M THINKING AS I'M ASKING THE QUESTION. IS I JUST AND I'LL LET MY- MY FITNESS SPEAK AS WELL BUT- I THINK AS I UNDERSTAND AB. TWO FIVE. THE IT. LEVERAGING TO STAY THAT SOMEBODY WAS OR FOR CERTAIN DEBTS THESE WERE THE RESULT OF ECONOMIC VIEW ABUSE- THIS IS A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM- CANCELING THAT DEBT OR REMOVING ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL LIABILITY- AND SO THERE IS NO PROCESS IN PLACE FOR DOING THAT THIS GOES A STEP BEYOND THAT AND CREATES THAT PROCESS SO SURVIVORS ACTUALLY CAN ELIMINATE THAT DATA AND- THAT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION BUT I WILL ALLOW- LEE IF YOU WOULD WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE LIKE TO TAKE THAT. AS WELL. SURE I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD GAS AND THAT ONE IS THAT IT IS A TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN IT WOULD BE- ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION THAT COULD BE USED IN AN ACTION UNDER AT THE NINE SEVENTY FIVE SO. THEY WORK TOGETHER AND IN THAT FAMILY COURT COULD IDENTIFY A GUY AS BEING THE WORST WHICH COULD THEN BE USED AS A PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A CLAIM UNDER AT THE PROPERTY IDENTIFIED IN IT YOU NINE SEVENTY FIVE. OKAY I WE CAN STATE AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR THE CREDITORS PART BUT I THINK WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE IT IS YES THE SURVIVOR HAS PROVEN TO REST BUT WE HAVE NOW HAVE A JUDGMENT AGAINST. SOME OTHER PERSON WHO IS THE REAL. PARTY IN INTEREST I'M ON THE ISSUE OF RESCISSION OF THE CONTRACT AND THE SECURITY- AUTOMOBILES- THE ONLY THING I.KNOW IS THAT THEY CAN'T. THEY CAN'T SELL THAT CAR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BIG THEY THEY GOT THE TIGHTLY GOT A BAD TITLE BUT THEY CAN STILL DRIVE IT AROUND. AND REGISTER IF THEY CAN'T SELL TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THEY JUST HAVE INDEFINITELY- HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO. THAT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE A YEAH ADJUSTED. NO I AND I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND SO I I'M SYMPATHETIC THE POINTS RAISED BY MISTER GOVERNOR. I THINK WITH THESE WERE LAID AMENDMENTS AND THE GOAL WAS ESSENTIALLY TO ADOPT A RECESSIONARY APPROACH TO. THE CONTRACT FOR THE LOAN OR THE CREDIT EXTENDED- AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IF YOU. YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE WHETHER IT'S A SECURED LOAN OR LOAN USED BY PARTICULAR IDENTIFIABLE OBJECT. I DON'T JUST GET THE PROPER CREDITS BASIC CONTRACTS LAW. AND SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE A DECISION B. THE MEASURE AND WE CLEARLY CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE BANKS THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. IT IS GETTING CLOSER TO THAT THOUGH AND I CAN APPRECIATE ACTUALLY THAT. PERSONALLY WAS. IN WRESTLING. ACTIONS TO TRY TO THIS BILL ON THE OTHER THE RIGHT PLACE. AND WHY DIDN'T THIS QUESTION REYES ONE OTHER CONCERN BROUGHT UP BY MR WILSON. WHICH IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CREDITOR I MEAN IT DID THE OF THE USER WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE- REQUIREMENT THAT- IT IS CERTAIN- CERTAIN FORMS WERE HAPPY ATTENDED THE PLEADINGS- BY THE PERSON. THAT BE SURVIVORS SEEKING TO HAVE THAT. THAT CANCELED. ARE THE REASON WE DON'T ALLOW HAPPENED SPECIFICALLY CALL FOR IDENTITY IS BECAUSE THAT. AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES WILL TELL YOU. I HE IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER THAT POTENTIALLY IT CAN CAUSE ALL SORTS OF VIOLENT SCENARIOS- SO WE'RE BEING MINDFUL OF THE BALANCE HERE BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF THE SURVIVOR. AS WELL AS THAT TEN AND WILL BE. AND FIT OF THIS PROCESS. ALL RIGHT. COME CERN'S OF CIRCLE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR RIGHT- CAN YOU CAN YOU ARTICULATE A SITUATION OTHER THAN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD YOU WOULD- YOU COULD SAY THAT- AND I'M I'M LOOKING AT THAT IT WAS A COERCED DEBT I. REAL TIME WITH WITH THAT THAT THE CONCEPT IN IF% IN ANY OTHER SITUATION OTHER THAN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT THIS IS MORE APPROPRIATELY- SHOULD APPROPRIATELY BELOCATED IN A IN A FAMILY LARA TO A DOMESTIC- IN THE IN THE IN THE RULES AROUND RELATIONSHIPS AS OPPOSED TO- BEING APPLIED BROADLY AND I AM STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND I BELIEVE. THE FOR FIVE. TWO IS. LIMITED TO- THREE SITUATIONS- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE I GUESS FOR FOSTER YOUTH- THOSE ARE THE SITUATIONS WE TO SPACE SO- IN EACH OF THOSE SINNERS OBVIOUSLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS THE ONE THAT IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS BUT A SIMILAR SET OF ABUSIVE OR COERCIVE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ARISE IN- WHO. WHO IN A SUBJECT TO THE CARE OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR FOSTER YOUTH- AND JUST AT THAT BAD ON THIS IS ROOTED IN A DURESS THEORY OF- CONTRACTS LAW THAT THAT IS NOT NOVEL. IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED IN COMMON LAW GOING BACK TO ENGLAND SO- YOU KNOW WE THINK THIS IS A NATURAL EXTENSION THIS WORK WE'RE JUST CLARIFYING THAT ECONOMIC COERCION IS A FORM OF DIRECT ESSENTIALLY. I AM THE IT IN ARE ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT CENTER BOARD JUST. KIND OF IN LINE WITH CENTER COPY COVER HEROES QUESTION IS. YOU HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES HERE- AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS THERE. IS THERE AN ADMINISTRATIVE OPTIONS THAT IS BEING OVERLOOKED IN FAVOR OF THE COURT A LEGAL CAUSE OF ACTION. WHAT I MEAN. IS THAT. MIGHT THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE A CO WORST DEPENDENT OR SPOUSE- SUBMIT SOMETHING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS A AS A PRECONDITION FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE EVIDENCE IS IN EARLY STAGE. THAT THEY ARE ACTING UNDER DURESS WITHOUT DISCLOSING NECESSARILY IN ANOTHER INFORMATION- THAT COULD PUT THEM IN HARM'S WAY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS WE HAVE LENDERS THAT THROUGH NO FAULT ON MODERATOR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO. CLOSE OUT THE QUEUE- LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND LINE THAT IS YOUR APOLOGIES FOR THAT. IF YOUR LINES ARE OPEN PREVIEW. I THINK WE'RE AND WHERE I'M GOING IS THAT HAVE WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE IDEA THAT THERE BE OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE LENDERS IN GOOD FAITH LAND TO A PARTY THEY HAVE NO REASON TO OBTAIN INSIGHT INTO THE DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT HOUSEHOLD OR WHETHER A HUSBAND OR A WIFE OR SOME OTHER PARTNERSHIP. IS TROUBLED THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD PROHIBIT- THE CONTRACT FROM BEING FILLED SO HOW DO YOU BALANCE OUT THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT HARMING THE- SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. PLACE BECAUSE OUR BANKING AND LENDING SYSTEM. IS ONE OF THE BEDROCK OF HOW WE FUNCTION IF YOU TAKE IF YOU INJECT A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH A BILL LIKE THIS COULD DO. AS A MEANS OF FOLKS BEING ABLE TO GET OUT SHOULD THEY REPRESENT THAT THEY WERE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE OR WERE UNDER YOU KNOW OR OR WERE UNDER- SOME FORM OF INTIMIDATION- I'M JUST. MORE OF A DISCUSSION POINT LIKE HAVE WE EXHAUSTED ALL IDEAS BEFORE MOVING IN THIS COURSE OF ACTION- WE'VE NOT EXHAUSTED ALL IDEAS OR INPUT I WOULD SAY THAT. THE TO. CHARACTERIZE THE PROCESS OF THIS BILL IS MERELY SAYING I'M UNHAPPY IN MY MARRIAGE OR I WAS THREATENED IS NOT ACTUALLY AT THIS BILL DOES YOU NEED SOME KIND OF DOCUMENTATION WHETHER POLICE REPORT. REPORT FROM A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE COUNSELOR- OR A JUDGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT YOU'RE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP OR SOME MEASURE APPROVED. AND THAT DEBT INCURRED WAS INCURRED DURING THE PERIOD THAT ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AS A RESULT OF THE ABUSE. SO THAT IS WHAT CREATES IN ORDER MEANS THE IN BUT A MEANS- AND APPROPRIATE TIME. BECAUSE IF MY WIFE AND I- PURCHASED A CAR IN WE WERE IN THIS. PARTICULAR CALL STE. ALL BUT TEN YEARS OR YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS INTO INTO THE REPAYMENT. YOU KNOW- IT'S DISCLOSED THE HARM COULD BE BORNE BY THE LENDER THROUGH THIS BILL SO THE IDEA IS AT IN APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF TIME. IS THERE IN ADMINISTRATIVE. ACTION THAT COULD BE TAKEN THAT WOULD OTHERWISE- I ALSO NOT UNCLEAR INTERRUPT- CENTER- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MINISTRY OF ACTION IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SENSE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OR- SOME OF SOME OF MORE REALIZATION WHETHER IT BE. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- OR SOME OTHER ENTITY THAT IDENTIFIES THAT I'M IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. AND THIS INDIVIDUALS CAPITALIZING ON MY CREDIT AVAILABILITY IS PER THING. THINGS I DON'T HAVE A MEANS I DON'T HAVE THE MEANS OF GETTING OUT OF IT. BUT I HAVE TO DO NOT TO S. VOTED. OTHER CAR- WHAT WHAT SO RESEARCH JOHNSON NO I MEAN A- IT'S MORE OF A IT'S NOT A ERROR IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE- PAID. FOR TRYING TO GET AT IT AGAIN. ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION WE'RE TALKING THE POLICE REPORT INDICATING THAT DEBT WAS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THAT ARREST OR THREAT AND FTC IDENTITY THEFT REPORT PLANS AFTER WORK ORDER ISSUED SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION ON TALKING ABOUT. I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DISRUPT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM- YOU KNOW LIKE I CUT MY TEETH IN AN EARLIER LIFE- WORKING ON SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE MORTGAGE MARKETS. AND LANDING AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SIMILAR CONCERNS RAISED AROUND ONE OFFS- YOU KNOW MORTGAGE RELIEF- LOAN FORGIVENESS. BECAUSE THEY THEY ALL DISRUPTING OF THE POTENTIAL SECURITY PARTICULAR SECURITIZED MARKETS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I DECIDED TO TAKE OUT REAL PROPERTY- IS CONCERNED- AND NOT JUST BY SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY. BUT ALSO ABOUT THE MBS MARKET GLOBALLY AND I DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT- SO WE MOVED AND THAT REMOVED A LOT OPPOSITION TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO TRY TO NARROW THIS IN THE WAYS YOU SUGGEST- AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS BALANCE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO WE THINK WILL EITHER LIVE MUCH BETTER LIVES OR LIVE AS OPPOSED TO BEING IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS OR DYING AS A RESULT OF THAT THAT THIS BILL CAN HELP AND WE'RE TRYING IT AND BALANCE THAT AGAINST THE CONCERNS RAISED WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE A FREE PASS WE DON'T CREATE A HUGE LOOPHOLE I THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE- THIS PROVISION THAT. SAYS AN ALLEGED DEBTOR WHO FALLS ON MERITORIOUS MOTIONS PLEADINGS IT CETERA SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE ALLEGED PREDATORS IT TOURNEY'S FEES AND COSTS NOTHING LAWSUIT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP PRIVILEGE LITIGATION WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A MASSIVE LOOPHOLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK A CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS AND FEEDBACK FROM OPPOSITION AND OTHERS TO HELP US MAKE THIS BILL BETTER THIS IS NOT A COMPLETED PRODUCT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY AGAIN I. RECALL THAT I DID THE BILL HERE WE MADE THE VOTES BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH THIS BILL THROUGH IN ITS FORM THEN BECAUSE IF WE FOR LIKE BILL NOT POINT YOU WANT TO DO. I COME HERE. I IT'S IN YOUR MEN AND OF COURSE IS WHAT'S WHAT'S TO PREVENT FRAUD- I JUST DON'T WANT TO PAY THIS AND NOW I START MAKING ALLEGATIONS AND- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR LAST COMMENT THAT EXPLAINS IT TO ME- I- EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WILL I WANT TO. SEE IT- GET BETTER BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING AND THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO AVOID ON PAYING DEBTS THAT YOU LEGITIMATELY. THAT YOU. NEED TO RELEASED YOU DIDN'T OBJECT TO AND THEN I GOT THIS- THIS BURDEN ON ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AT THAT IN IN GOOD FAITH MADE THE VIDEO. I THINK IT THOSE COMMENTS AND I AGREE WITH THEM COMPLETELY CENTER. ALL RIGHT- BILL'S BEEN MOVED ON IN CENTER MAN I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS OVER THE LAST. EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF IN A AND I KNOW YOU ARE IN GOOD FAITH HERE AND TRYING TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF GOOD FAITH NON CULPABLE LENDERS. WHO NEITHER KNOW NOR SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S A COURSE OF RELATIONSHIP AND OF COURSE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS ILLUSTRATED BY SOME OF THE OPPONENTS. IS WHERE A ABUSIVE SPOUSE COURSES THIS MOUSE FOR EXAMPLE INTO BUYING A LAMBORGHINI UNDER THEIR NAME EXCLUSIVELY UNDER THE- ABUSE SPOUSE'S NAME AND NOT BEING ABLE TO REPOSSESS IT. I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO. DO THIS. LAMBERT IN B. REPROCESSED. NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO THIS MISTER WILSON INDICATE. I UNDER THE SCENARIO. FORTY THE PERPETRATOR IS NOT NAMED IF FOR EXAMPLE THE DEBT IS SOLELY ANCHORED BY THE VIEWS SPOUSE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND CENTER MINUTE YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERPETRATOR IS NOT SOMEHOW. AVOIDING INSTABILITY OR LIABILITY. OF COURSE IF IT'S A JOINT DEBT THE CREDITOR KANAME BOTH BUT IF IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE THAT. WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE WE DO THAT AND THEN THIRDLY JUST AS A MATTER OF DISCLOSURE- ONE OF THE SPOT CO SPONSORS THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER WAS FORMALLY A BOARD MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER IN MY- LAW PARTNERS HAVE BEEN LONG TIME. FOR MEMBERS I DON'T THINK THAT PRECLUDES ME FROM- FROM VOTING ON THIS BILL- AND- HAVING. THAT THERE'S A MOTION BY SAID A WHITE CAL SKI A BY THE WAY MY CONDOLENCES TO ALL THOSE IN THE VIEWING AUDIENCE THAT FAINTED WHEN SEND A WHITE CAL SKI. TOOK THE VISION OF THE CREDITORS.

MANY ELECTION OFFICIALS YOUR EXPRESSED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAMS IN THEIR STATE.

AMBER I BOARDED. GUERRIERO I THE RUSSELL. THE REST SO I CAN SAY. HERTZBERG JONES AIRED THERE'D AYE STERN STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI CASKEY I WIENER YOU HAVE SIX ZERO WITH SOME MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT ON CALL THANK YOU AND MISTER I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND SEVERE PAIN IS GOING TO DO HIS BILL AND I'M GOING TO COME BACK. TRANSPORTATION ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY- NEXT WILL HAVE SENATOR PAN. CENTER PAN IS HERE ON. S. B. TEN EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- SENATORS AND ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE APPROPRIATE THAT I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL TEN EIGHTEEN EMILY AFTER THE PRESENTATION OF THE BILL YOU JUST HEARD. IS NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY- ELECTION WORKERS HAVE BEEN UNDER PERSONAL THREAT- I KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS HAVE BEN UNDER PERSONAL THREATEN WE'VE TRIED TO GET IN THE SAME PROGRAM- AND SO THE QUESTION WHY. WHAT'S CHANGED Y. AS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE HAVE. PEOPLE SERVING THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC HEALTH CARE ELECTIONS AND SO FORTH. WHO ARE NOW SEEKING THE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS. AND THE TYPES OF PERSONAL TAXES THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM AND THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB TEN EIGHTEEN THE PLATFORM ACCOUNTABLY CHANCE PARENTS THE ACT. I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE COUNCIL AND STAKEHOLDERS WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THE PROPOSED AMOUNT WHICH I AM ACCEPTING THANK YOU. NO SOCIAL MEDIA STREAMER WE CHANGE THE WAY WE SHARE AND CONSUME INFORMATION AND ACTUALLY INFLUENCES OUR ACTIONS. AND YET WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE ALGORITHMS THAT DETERMINE WHAT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED. TO US. OR EVEN WHAT IT MISINFORMATION TO PRESENTED TO US. IN HER CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCIS HOW CAN EPLAIN HOW FACEBOOK KNOWINGLY LEVERAGE THEIR ALGORITHMS TO PRIORITIZE PROFITS AND ENGAGEMENT WHICH ALSO MEANT PROMOTING MISINFORMATION- AND ANGER. OVER CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY IN FACT IN THE FALL OUT OF THE JANUARY SIXTH ATTACK ON THE NATION'S CAPITAL. THOUSANDS OF LEAKED INTERNAL DOCUMENTS PROVE THAT FACEBOOK PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN SPREADING INFLAMMATORY MISINFORMATION ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD AND AIDED COMMUNICATION EFFORTS OF EXTREMIST MILITIAS. THE HEAD OF THE RIOTS. SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHMS ARE ALSO KEY DISTRIBUTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH MISINFORMATION AS ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ONE STUDY FOUND THAT. A MERE TWELVE PEOPLE. AND THEIR ASSOCIATION RESPONSIBLE 465% ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE VACCINE MISINFORMATION. ON SOCIAL MEDIA TWITTER FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM- WHICH COURT POSES AN ENORMOUS DANGER PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN FACT VERY RECENTLY A- PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL NATURE ONE LEADING SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN THE WORLD. SHOW THAT ONLINE MISINFORMATION WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO KOBE NINETEEN VACCINE HASN'T SEEN REFUSAL. IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE ALGORITHMS HAVE A PROPENSITY TO REINFORCE BIAS IN THE QUALITY AND MISINFORMATION. NOW TRANSPARENCY IS ESSENTIAL IN UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THESE ALGORITHMS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT GIVIG THE PUBLIC THE TOOLS- WE NEED TO HELP IDENTIFY HOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE IMPACTING OUR LIVES. SB TEN EIGHTEEN REQUIRES ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO MAKE ANNUAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURES REGARDING THEIR ALGORITHMS TO METRICS AS WELL AS THE CONTENT MODERATION EFFORTS. THESE REPORTS WILL INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF ALL PRODUCT FEATURES THAT MAKE USE OF ALGORITHMS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD AND THE SUMMARY OF METRICS USED BY THE PLATFORM TO SCORE RANK CONTENT. WITHOUT DISSEMINATING TRADE SECRETS SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR DETAILS RESTING FOR SUMMARIES. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND MANY OF YOU PERHAPS OF USE THAT TURN YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. HAVE ENORMOUS POWER TO AFFECT WHAT WE SEE HOW WE FEEL BUT WE BELIEVE. AND YET HOW THE OPERATE REMAINS EXTREMELY OPAQUE. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT ONE OF OUR LEADING SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES FACEBOOK IS SUCH A CONTROLLED BY ONE PERSON. ONE MAN MARK ZUCKERBERG AND ABOUT TO HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TWITTER THAT'S GONNA BE TAKEN PRIVATE BY AGAIN ANOTHER SINGLE MAN. BILLIONAIRE SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC THEIR NAME ACCOUNTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS. DURING CONTROLLED BY A SINGLE PERSON. SO ULTIMATELY SB TEN EIGHTEEN IS A NECESSARY STEP TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY TO WORK WITH SO MUCH I MEAN I FEEL JUST KNOW HOW THEY OPERATE RIGHT. THERE'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS POWERFUL BURGEONING INDUSTRY. AND SO- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE PROFESSOR NATHANIEL PERSILY PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND THE AUTHOR TO FEDERAL PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY ACT. THE DESKSIDE SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT BUT THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO- PROFESSOR. PERSILY IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE PLEASE IDENTIFY. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CENTER COURT AGREED USELESS LEGISLATION I HAD NEVER- AND THIS IS- YOU KNOW A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AT A CRITICAL TIME. WE CANNOT LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US AND WE KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THAT- AS AS INDEPENDENCE MENTIONED- WE NOW OKAY YOU KNOW THAT HE COULD BE MORE PRESSING. ON THE DAY AFTER IT LOOKS LIKE- THE SINGLE PERSON IS NOW GOING TO PURCHASE WHAT HE DESCRIBED THAT THE PUBLIC SQUARE. AND SO IT'S EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE GET GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN ALGORITHMS AND THE CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES OF THESE LARGE FIRMS- AND THERE'S SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT THE FIRST. IS THAT I. VERY DIFFICULT FOR US RISE AT OTHER KIND OF- PUBLIC. THE DEAL WITH THE LARGE PLATFORMS WHETHER IT'S REGULARLY AND- PRIVACY AND ALLOW. IF WE HAVE GREATER TRANSPARENCY IT WILL LEAD TO BETTER INFORM DECISION MAKING FOR PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS ARE BOOKING CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE FIRMS THEMSELVES I THINK- REQUIRED THEIR PRODUCT BECAUSE THEIR BEHAVIOR WILL CHANGE. IF THEY KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING WATCHED. AND THE THIRD IS IT WILL HELP ALL OF US UNDERSTAND LIFE ONLINE BECAUSE MORE MORE OF OUR LIFE REQUIRING ONLINE. AND SO WHETHER IT'S THE PATHOLOGIES OF THE ONLINE INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM. BE A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT SELECTION DID NOT CONSPIRACY THEORY. ISSUES OF CHILD THEY HAVE A LIFE OR DEATH MORE MUNDANE TOPICS ABOUT- YOU KNOW SORT OF HOW PEOPLE ARE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER WE NEED TO HAVE. BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ONLINE INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM. THERE ARE LOTS OF BOOKS. ABOUT THE PREVALENCE DAY AS HATE SPEECH DISINFORMATION OR I'LL BUY IT I'M. MORGAN COLIN. BUT WE CAN KNOW WHETHER THOSE FOLKS. SURE THAT WE HAVE GREATER OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT- ELSE WE SHOULD IN SO OF S. B. TEN A PRESENT HEARING SEEING ONE ON THE PHONE A MATTER MATTER IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP THOSE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU TO CHECK FOR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. CERTAINLY NINE Q. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TURN NOW TO THE OPPOSITION- I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LIST IN OPPOSITION I SEE MISTER HOFFMAN HERE MR OFTEN. THANK YOU MR CENTER STILL HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF TACK MATCH- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT'S IN PRINT- BUT WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR. AND THIS COMMITTEE- THAT TO WORK TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS- AS YOU KNOW SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS CONSIDERED FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR- AND WE AGREE THAT IT IS A VALUABLE CALL TO ADD ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT HELPS OUR- CONSUMERS KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE- RULES THAT- WE EXPECT OF THEM AND ALSO TO. HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO PROTECT THEM FROM HARMFUL CONTENT- AND WHERE THIS BILL AND I THINK THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE- THAT IS ACTUALLY AN IMPROVEMENT UPON OTHER- TRANSFER TO MEASURE. IS THAT I THINK IT STRIKES A BETTER BALANCE- IN WAYNE TRANSPARENCY SIX THREE- BEFORE. THAT YOU OUR OUR- AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS- IDENTIFY HARMFUL CONTENT AND REMOVE IT- AND- YOU KNOW BY REQUIRING SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW THOSE SYSTEMS WORK- NOT ONLY JEOPARDIZES PROPRIETY. INFORMATION BUT CAN ACTUALLY LEAD TO DECREASED SECURITY AND MORE HARMFUL CONTENT SO WE THINK THIS BILL- AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED- STRIKES A BETTER BALANCE IN THAT REGARD- AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS AND COMMENTS BUT- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR- AND- COMMITTEE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU MR OFTEN- MISS AMY BOSS YOUR AVAILABLE IN THE FALL. YES YES THANK GOODNESS YOU MUST REMEMBER READY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT THIS BILL RIGHT NOW WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB TWELVE FIVE IT'S A BILL THAT BACKS VICTIMS AND CHILDREN. MEMBERS OUR CHILDREN NEED US THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY CASES WHERE THEY WORK CLEAR SIGNS OF ESCALATING VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS SO MANY CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED AND SO MANY VICTIMS COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED BUT NOTHING IS BEING DONE FOR VICTIMS WHO HAVE A PROTECTIVE ORDER. HAVE REPORTED SIGNS OF ETHICALLY. OR IT HEY THERE ABUSERS TO THE COURTS I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL VICTIMS TO SEEK. TO THE JUDGE AND REPORTED THE ABUSER IS EITHER GOING TO KILL ME OR KILL MY CHILDREN AND THEY DID NOTHING. ANASTASIUS A MOTHER MY DISTRICT WHO LOST HER FIVE YEAR OLD LITTLE BOY TO. HIS FATHER. KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH PLEADING WITH THE COURT TO DO SOMETHING THAT THE FATHER WAS DANGEROUS AND WAS HURTING THE LITTLE BOY. AND THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE JUST HAVE A CASE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THREE LITTLE GIRLS SAMARIA H. TEN SAMANTHA AT ELEVEN THE MEDIA MARAGA TERRACE H. THIRTEEN WERE FATALLY SHOT BY THEIR FATHER. THAT I A PRIME EXAMPLE EVEN WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER HE HAD- GONE. THE PROTECTED PERSONS HOME EVEN WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER HE HAD BEEN HELD ON INVOLUNTARY PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION. AND ON TOP OF THAT HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER AND HEALTH CARE WORKER ONLY SIX DAYS BEFORE THE MURDERS. THE SIGNS WERE THERE THERE WERE CLEAR SIGNS OF ESCALATING BEHAVIOR BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER THERE WAS NOTHING THAT. COULD HAVE DONE. SNOWLINE IS THAT REQUIRES TE COURT TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES I THAT SITUATION. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE AND GIVE THE PARENTS. JUST BECAUSE THE JUDGE HAS GIVEN VISITATION RIGHTS TO AN ABUSIVE PARENT WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE DANGER IS OVER IN FACT THE DANGER CONTINUES TO BE PRESIDENT AND ANYTHING CAN SET OFF AN ABUSER. SO NOW IT IS OUR JOB TO SEE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO. ESCALATING BEHAVIOR IF THERE IS A SIGN THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE IN DANGER WE NEED MUST ACT THIS BILL WILL GIVE THE PAIR WITH THE PROTECTIVE ORDER THE ABILITY TO PAUSE. GO BACK TO COURT AND REASSESS THE DANGERS TO HIM OR HERSELF AND THEIR CHILDREN IT IS A MODEST WAY TO GIVE HOPE TO SO MANY OF THESE CHILDREN THAT ARE DYING AT THE HANDS OF AN ABUSIVE PARENT WHO IS OUT. OF DEBT FORGIVEN FOR REVENGE I'LL TO COSTING WHICH DISTRESS AND HARM THE VICTIM AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE SIMPLY ASKING FOR ANY MEDIUM PROTECTION UNTIL HEARINGS CONDUCTED. FIFTY DAYS. NOW IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MIGHT WITNESSES THEN HAVE ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR AND DOCTORATE OF SOCIOLOGY AND CRIMINOLOGY. A RESEARCHER ON HOMICIDE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ARE WITH ME ALSO WE HAVE CAM ROBINSON FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND THANK YOU DOCTOR LYNN HOFF CORTESE IN IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. I AM HERE YOU HEAR ME OK YES YOU PLEASURES. OKAY GOOD GO AHEAD. OKAY AS THE DRUG WILL BE OKAY AND DOES NOT RESIGN AND A FULL PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA I STUDIED VIOLENCE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I'VE FOUGHT FIRST FORCES UNDER THAT METHOD BY OLYMPIC KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY AND DESIGNED THE COURSES THAT COMPRISE GRADUATE LEVEL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRACK AT THE. INSTANCE THE ALLERGY IT USED YEAH. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW PLAN OFFENDERS AND VIOLENT COMMIT. FOR SOME REASON SOME PEOPLE VIEW VIOLENCE AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THEIR PROBLEMS NOT REALISTIC. THEY DO THE WORLD BRIEFLY STATED. HEY YOU'RE HIS THE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN I HAVE VISIT TO PROVIDE YOUR NOT. AND THE VIOLENT PERSONS VIOLENCE IS IT ESCALATING. THANK YOU THOUSAND EIGHT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING THEIR PARENTS DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS AND OVER A HUNDRED OF THESE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. OVER 70% OF TILE HOMICIDE BY. A RELATED TO SEPARATION OR DIVORCE ARE COMMITTED BY THE FATHER. MOST CHILD HOMICIDES ARE NOT A SURPRISE THE CHILDREN AT EITHER BEEN DIRECTLY THREATENED OR THE PROTECTIVE CARE ACT CAREGIVER OR PARENT KNOWS THAT THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN THREATENED. IT'S A MISCONCEPTION TO THINK THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ONLY AMONG THE WELL AS- THE ADULT IN THE FAMILY. A HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIS EXTREMELY RELEVANT THE DECISIONS RELATED TO TRIAL IS THE FACE AND I THOUGHT THEY- MOST CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED BY A PARENT ARMORED MURDER DURING UNSUPERVISED VISITS FROM THE VIOLENT ABUSIVE PARENTS HOWEVER AS WE'VE RECENTLY WITNESSED HAVING SOMEONE OVERSEE THE VISITATION DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN THAT THE CHILDREN ARE. EIGHT CHILDREN WILL TELL PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEWERS THAT OUT FOR VIOLENT IN THEIR HOME. AND BASED ON THAT KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE GAS SHARING CLIPS FROM VIDEOS THAT CHILDREN WOULD SHARE WITH THE FORT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH SENATE BILL BOTH SIXTY FIVE INTERVENE ON THEIR BEHALF. ON THE BEHALF OF CHILD SAFETY. THAT IS BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE AND PROFESSIONAL SPECIALIZED IN THE STUDY OF QUALITY IS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT NEED FOR LAWS TO PROTECT CHILDREN WITH THEM IN SUPPORT ONE. HUNDRED STATE.

THE PERPETRATORS IS THIS- OPTION NUMBER TWO IS THAT THEY COULD. BORDER PROFESSIONALLY SUPERVISED VISITS THAT YOU BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD BE PENDING A NOTICED HEARING- WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. OR ACTUALLY AT TWENTY ONE DAYS IS EXISTING LAW. WHAT THE THIRD OPTION ONE THAT'S EXERCISE OR TOO MUCH IS TO DO NOTHING AND LEAVE THE- IN PERSON CONTACT ORDERS IN PLAY. AND THAT IS THE FIRST PART OF EXISTING LAW IS TOO MANY JUDGES ARE JUST LETTING THE VISITS HAPPEN EVEN WITH PRESENTED WITH AN EMERGENCY MOTION WHETHER HIS AND- VERY DISTURBING ON TOP CONNDOT- ALL BEING. SOLD AS WORST CASE IN SACRAMENTO- FOR SOMEONE TO STAND WEAPONS AND MADE THREATS SB TWELVE SIXTY FIVE WOULD CLOSE THE PTION THREE FOUR AND WOOD- HOPEFULLY REQUIRE THAT WHAT WHEN PRESENTED WITH AN EMERGENCY APPLICATION ABOUT NEW THREATS NEW CONDUCT.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OF QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE. SERVER ALSO- JUST- ONE. REGARDLESS OF MY QUESTIONS JUST THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOUR INTENTION HERE IS TO- PROTECT THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES THOSE WHO COULD B IN DANGER- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN GOING THROUGH THAT KIND OF TRAUMA TO ALSO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEIR PARENTS FOR A DIFFICULT ENOUGH OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING. SO ONE QUESTION I HAD IS ABOUT THE FIFTEEN DAY HEARING OR NOT I MAY HAVE. NOT- READ ANY KIND OF AMENDMENT RIGHT BUT- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS I UNDERSTAND IT- AGREES THAT- A FIFTEEN THE CURRENT CASELOAD IN THE COURTS- DOES NOT IS UNREALISTIC TO ALLOW A HEARING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS- SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. THANK YOU I KNOW HOW IT'S A CONCERN THAT UP I FEELS LIKE THE COURT IS OVERWHELMED BUT- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON A SEPARATE BILL TO OBJECT TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO FOR NOT ONLY JUDGES BUT COURTS TO EXPEDITE THESE KIND OF BILLS AND DIE. AND CONTINUE TO PRESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW IT. THE CHILDREN END UP PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT. FOR THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR COURT SYSTEM SO YOU KNOW I JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN'S LIVES BUT I WILL. DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO PRESS ON THE ISSUE I DO WANT THESE COURT CASES TO BE HEARD WE NEED HIM TO BE EXPEDITED AND- IN ALL THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN ARE AT STAKE BY PRESSING FOR FUNDING ON THAT. REGARD YEAH THE NIGHT I MENTION THAT BECAUSE- IN MY BUDGET SUB FIVE THAT WE GO THROUGH THE- BUDGET FOR THE COURT SYSTEM. THERE IS. A PRESSURE I JUST WANT. THAT IF WE GO DOWN THE LINE OF- EXPECTING THAT WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS IS GOING TO BE A HEARING. OF THAT WE REALLY. THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF MAKING THIS. CHANGE- VALID AND JUSTIFIABLE NO ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE WANTED TO BE A EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SO BOB YOU KNOW I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT YOUR QUESTION RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE RIGHT- YOU KNOW THERE IS- DEFICIENCIES CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM AND SO I WILL CONTINUE TO OP POSSIBLY SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND SEE TO MAKE SURE HOW DO WE MAKE THIS- I READ BLOODY BITE. AGAIN I KNOW THAT WE CANNOT JUST LEAVE OUR CHILDREN OUT TO DRIVE WHEN THE DANGEROUS SO PRESENT AND- AND I WILL LIKE I SAID CONTINUE TO PUSH AND SIT DOWN WITH WHOEVER I NEED TO SIT DOWN TO IT TO. MAKE THIS YOU KNOW HAPPEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE COURT HEARINGS ARE HEARD WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THAT ARE CABALLERO. WELL I WANNA- THANK YOU FOR ALL THREE NISPEL IF I'M NOT A CO AUTHOR I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED- ONE OF THE I'M SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY A CENTER GARAGE SO AND I AGREE WITH YOU CENTER RUBIO- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET. THE ISSUE IN FRONT OF A JUDGE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IN THE EVENT THAT THE FIFTEEN DAYS IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN- TO. ISSUE A TEMPORARY ORDER THAT THERE BE NO VISITATION AND TELL THAT COURT CAN HOLD A HEARING I THINK WOULD BE TOTALLY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE- THE CHILDREN THAT ARE GETTING INJURED AWFUL MURDER R. THIS CONTROL. TROLL OVER THE FAMILY AND OVER THAT THE CPOPS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- IF THERE IS THAT. FEAR BASED ON IDENTIFIABLE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THAT FAMILY AND THOSE CHILDREN UNTIL THE COURT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A HEARING ON IT SO- I THINK THAT- I THINK FIFTEEN DAYS IS REASONABLE AND IF IT CAN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE COURT SCHEDULE THEN I THINK THEY A TEMPORARY ORDER SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND YOU MIGHT THINK OF ADDING AT THAT KIND OF A BUT I'VE EVER RELEASED IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURT TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT WITH AND THAT. INTEREST A SET. THAT'S IS REALLY THE ISSUE THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME- THANK YOU. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WILL MOVE ABOUT. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE OF CENTER RUBIO A FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING A CHAMPION WITH RESPECT TO THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BOTH SPOUSES OR PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE CHILDREN NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TW THANKYOU FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS BILL AND I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL- IS BOTH EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. THERE IS AN ISSUE THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR A PARENT TO HAVE VISITATION AND- YOU'VE DIRECTED AND ASKED US TO HELP. BASICALLY STRUCTURE A BILL THAT WOULD PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER THINK WE WILL ON A NIGHT I KNOW YOU AGREED TO CERTAIN AMENDMENTS. AS TWO OF THOSE AMENDMENTS ALL ALL MENTION THOSE THE SECOND AND THE FOLLOWING TO CENTER THERE ALSO INCIDENT CARILLO. IF THE COURTS CAN'T ACCOMMODATE A HEARING IF THEY CAN'T ACCOMMODATE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN. THEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO THE COURT IT CANNOT BE THEY WERE GONNA LEAVE CHILDREN IN JEOPARDY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE COURTS SO THAT'S OUR- OF MUTUAL OBLIGATION TO DO THAT. LASTLY AND- I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS THIS IS A BIT TECHNICAL BUT THAT- THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS REFERRED TO MODIFYING A PROTECTIVE ORDER. BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU'RE GOING TO AMEND- THIS TO REFER TO REQUEST FOR AN ORDER TO MODIFY. YOUR VISITATION ORDER AS OPPOSED PROTECT ORDER. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT IN ORDER TO GET THEM. OKAY AND THEN ALSO OF THE MEMBERS REQUIRE PERSON SEEKING THE ORDER THE STATE THAT THEY FEAR THE RESTRAINT PERSONAL HARM CHILDREN. HEADQUARTERED VISITATION OR CUSTODY. FOR IN THAT THE RESTRAINT PERSON THREATEN HARM OR KILL THE CHILDREN THAT THAT'S CORRECT AS WELL THAT'S CORRECT OKAY IN AND THEN LASTLY THE MET. REQUIRE THE PERSON SEEKING ORDER OUT TO.

I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT WILL UPDATE AND MODERNIZE- PENALTIES FOR- HEALTH PLANS OF VIOLATE STATE LAW IN TERMS OF DENYING COVERAGE THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WITHIN A LOT OF WORK IN RECENT YEARS. TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING FULL COVERAGE WHETHER IT'S AROUND MENTAL HEALTH OR OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS AND THESE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW NEED TO HAVE A MEETING. ON THE ONLY A MEETING IF THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN THE PLANS VIOLATE- THOSE- REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY- THE MAXIMUM PENALTY. THAT CAN BE- APPLIED OR OR IMPOSE ON A PLAN PER VIOLATION IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WAS ADOPTED DECADES AGO IT HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED AT ALL AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IS EFFECTIVELY A COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND I CAN BE CHEAPER SIMPLY TO VIOLATE THE LAW- DAN- TO- TO FIND- I'M SORRY. SHE PREPARED LEVINE IN THE FALL OF THE LAW- SERVICE THIS LEGISLATION WELL IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY- THIS LEGISLATION. WILL ADJUST- THE PENALTIES SO THAT WE HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WILL CREATE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY I TESTIFIED SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE JASMINE HICKS AND DIANA DOUGLAS FROM HALIFAX ALL RIGHT- MISTAKES OR MISSED DOUBLE SO YOU HEAR. YES HI THANK YOU MY NAME IS JASMINE HAKES AND I'M THE MOTHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY- THIS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES KAISER OFFERED US A FEW PAMPHLETS INCENTIVES HOME THAT SAME YEAR THE D. M. H. C. CITED KAISER FOR SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT AND OTHER LAWS THEY WERE FINED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE REPORTED PROFITS THAT YEAR OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MY DAUGHTER SUICIDAL IDEATIONS GREW ALARMING WE BEGAN PLEADING WITH KAISER FOR THERAPY AND HELP. WE WERE TOLD THERE WERE NO THERAPIST AVAILABLE. SINCE THEN SHE HAS TRIED TO KILL HERSELF TWICE. TWICE ON LIFE SUPPORT IN THE ICU. IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SHE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED SIX TIMES. AND EVERY TIME SHE'S BEEN DISCHARGED BUT NO FOLLOW UP SERVICES OR AFTER CARE. IN SPITE OF THE SEVERITY OF HER MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND REPEATED APPEALS FOR SERVICE KIZER HAS INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE NO AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF. AND THEY'RE CONTRACTED THERAPISTS ARE BOOKED SOLID THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE STAGNANT WAITLIST AND HER KAISER PSYCHIATRIST ONLY COMES IN ON MONDAYS SO IT TAKES MONTHS FOR US TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THIS IS NOT PARITY. BUT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY MY DAUGHTER IS ALIVE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE STILL NEEDS HELP. AND WE STILL CAN'T GET IT. MUCH LIKE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS FOR DID WAS DEVELOPING THE DEADLY PENDO WITH THE PENALTIES AS THEY STAND IS CHEAPER FOR KAISER TO PAY ANTIQUATED FINDS. THEM TO DO WHAT THEY ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO. ASA'S TELL ME TO GET HELP IF I NEED IT. AND WE'RE TRYING WE HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS WITH THIS BILL YOU'LL BE TELLING KAISER THAT BUSINESSES USUAL IS NO LONGER OKAY. INCREASED FINES WON'T FIX EVERYTHING BUT IT MIGHT GIVE MY DAUGHTER AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS. THE CARE NEEDED TO HAVE A HAPPY HEALTHY FUTURE INSTEAD OF ENDING UP ASIDE IN ALL TOO COMMON STATISTIC. I URGE YOU TO APPROVE THIS LONG OVERDUE REFORM. FOR STATES IN PERSON SYSTEM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTAKES- THANK YOU FOR SHARING- YOUR STORE YOUR DAUGHTER'S STORY. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DIANA DOUGLAS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WILL ENSURE HEALTH PLANS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. CALIFORNIANS RELY UPON THESE PROTECTIONS INCLUDE ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE LANGUAGE ACCESS INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW AND PROCESSES FOR PLACING GRIEVANCES. DAMAGE THESE PROTECTIONS RYAN A STRONG FRAMEWORK OF BOTH CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES CORRECTION AND CORRECTION ACTION EXCUSE ME CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE HOWEVER WATER STANDARDS HAVE BEEN UPDATED MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS THE PENALTY TO RARELY IF EVER BEEN UPDATED. THE BASICS OF A CIVIL FINE MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MANY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES WHICH REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY MAJORITY OF PENALTIES IMPOSED HAVE REMAINED FIXED FOR DECADES HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TREATING FINDS IS JUST ANOTHER COST. WHAT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO PAY VIOLATIONS WHEN THEY GET CAUGHT RATHER THAN TO IMPROVE SERVICE CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE WITH DELAYED CARE DENIED SERVICES AND GRIEVANCES GONE UNRESOLVED. SB A FIFTY IT WILL UPDATE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES BY MULTIPLYING THE KERN AMOUNTS BY FOR. MOST MHC PENALTIES ARE ADMINISTRATIVE IN THESE AMOUNTS TO REMAIN THE SAME FOR DECADES CIVIL PENALTIES WHICH HAVE BEEN CAPPED AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. WOULD BE INCREASED TO A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THIS REPRESENTS INCREASES IN INFLATION AND ALSO IN HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS AND COSTS. AND FINALLY SB EIGHT FIFTY IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS INCREASED PENALTIES WILL INCREASE COMMENSURATELY. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE FOUR TIMES MULTIPLIER WILL ONLY APPLY TO PENALTIES WITH A SPECIFIC AMOUNT. AND KEEPS THE MINIMUM FOR CIVIL PENALTIES AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND COMMIT TO TAKING THE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO HOW. PENALTY INCREASES WOULD BE TIED TO INCREASES IN HEALTH PLAN COSTS IN APPROPRIATIONS AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK HERE. WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL SB FIFTY EIGHT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU MISTER DOUGLAS ALL RIGHT. OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT TO COME FORWARD IDENTIFY YOURSELF. THE CHAIR MEMBERS JANICE- ALLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OTHERS HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED SINGH KNOWN APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE- MATTER IF WE GO TO THE PHONE. FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. IF YOU'D LIKE CHAU Y'ALL GO AHEAD OF YOU TO PRODUCE A MICROPHONE. SERVICE WHO- GOOD EVENING LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN PHENOMENON POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. NOW BACK TO THOSE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU AND IT'S ONE ZERO. I WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT A LINE OR FIFTY TWO. RIGHT YOUR LINE IS PRETTY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD EVENING THOUGH I THOUGHT OF ALL THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT FIVE EIGHT THANK YOU. I THINK THAT. AND THEN IN Q. AT THIS TIME NO WAS IN Q. ARE AT LET'S GO OPPOSITION I HAVE NICK OF THE WE CELLS IN IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NICKEL RESOURCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS- IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. WHICH RAISES HEALTH CARE COSTS BY CREATING A PUNITIVE IN COMPLICATED NEW PENALTY STRUCTURE ON HEALTH PLANS MASSIVELY INCREASING PENALTIES ON HEALTH PLANS DOES NOT SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DOES NOT IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHAT IT DOES IT DIRECTS RESOURCES AWAY FROM DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND UNDERMINES IT NATURE OF REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT- WE DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS BASED ON THE LOGIC THAT MAKING PENALTIES MORE MORE PUNITIVE WORSE WILL SOMEHOW IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. NOW YOU KNOW- REFERENCING THE I. TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT TODAY YOU KNOW LOOK WE'RE ALL MADE OUT OF THE SAME STUFF WE'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE INTERACTED WITH THE SYSTEM AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS OUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT GREAT YOU KNOW SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ARGUED LAST YEAR WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SENATOR WIENER'S SB TWO TWENTY ONE THAT IT IS A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ISSUE- AND THERE ARE LACK OF PROVIDERS IN THIS AREA PARTICULARLY ONES. THAT ARE WILLING TO CONTRACT WITH PLANS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND I THINK SENATOR WIENER HAS ONE THAT- THIS YEAR BUT- YOU KNOW I WILL SAY CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ARE HEAVILY REGULATED CURRENTLY UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT- THERE ARE THERE IS A PENALTY STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AND CIVIL PENALTIES. ON THE GRANTS THE DIRECTOR OF GMAC THE DEPARTMENT MATTERS HEALTH CARE WHY TO FORTY TO LEVY PENALTIES ON HEALTH PLANS- AND EVEN REVOKE LICENSES OF PLANS- THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT LAW ALREADY GRANTS SUFFICIENT FORSMAN AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WHICH HAS ALLOWED ITSELF PRETTY CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE I'M IN ASSESSING PENALTIES AND AS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED ITS SIGNIFICANT BIRDS- IN ADDITION TO PENALTIES THE TEAM YOU SEE ALSO ISSUES CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WHICH REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO REMEDY PROBLEMS ARE FACE EVEN FURTHER SANCTIONS DO. SO I THINK SOMETIMES BILLS CHARACTERIZE MERELY UPDATING ON THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND YOU KNOW IF THAT WAS THE CONVERSATION I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE THING WHAT THIS BILL DOES THOUGH. IT DELETES THE LIMITATIONS SO THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON CIVIL PENALTIES- IT IN THE LAW IT ANYMORE IF THIS BILL WOULD SPEAK WERE TO BE ENACTED. SO IT DELETES THE CEILING. AND REPLACES IT WITH A FLOOR THAT IS TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE CEILING- AND YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT. IT IS PRETTY EXCESSIVE- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- SO IF YOU KNOW REPRESENTS A WHOPPING INCREASE IN SINGLE CIVIL PENALTIES BY A FACTOR OF TEN MISTER LOUISE ALSO YEAH. GO AHEAD AND WRAP IT UP YEAH GREAT. WE THINK THE GOAL OF REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT IS TO- YOU MAKE THINGS BETTER- YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS. WE THINK A- BILL LIKE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY PAY OUR MEMBERS AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT AND CREATE A MORE. KIND OF NEGATIVE. ATMOSPHERE AND TRY TO RESOLVE THINGS ALREADY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. TO S. B. EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. SINGH KNOWING HEARING ROOM. MODERATE IF LET'S GO THE PHONES FOR THOSE IN OPPOSITION SB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. THANK YOU AND COMPOSED PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.
