BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.144

YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:16.835

TO SOLVE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:12.657
THEY MUST GO HAND IN HAND. WE

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:43.054
MEMBERS I HAVE BEEN SERVING ON

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:44.889

AT ALSO HERE AT CMC. AND WE HAVE

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:50.428
BEEN TALKING ABOUT CLOSING THIS

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.831
DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR AT LEAST NINE

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.834
OR TEN YEARS. WE HAVE LOTS OF

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.069
MONEY NOW IN THE PIPELINE. AND

00:28:58.136 --> 00:29:00.438
SO I WANT US TO RECOGNIZE

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:02.974
SOMETHING THAT. THIS IS

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.877
ACHIEVABLE. WE CAN CLOSE THIS

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:11.349
GAP. IT IS A FINITE. OBLA WE

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:12.884
THINK THERE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:14.819
AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.521
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:20.358
ON SERVED. THAT IS AN ACHIEVABLE

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:20.892
GOAL PARTICULARLY WITH THE

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.061
FUNDING WE HAVE. I THINK WE NEED

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:24.295
TO RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THE

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.397
PROVIDERS ARE READY THEY'RE

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:27.065
WILLING THEY'RE ABLE THEY'RE AT

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.667
THE TABLE. AND THEY REALLY WANT

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:32.237
TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS AND YET

00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:33.905
I THINK SOME GET CONCERNED THAT

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:35.874
THE BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.109
INVOLVED IN THIS. ARE BASICALLY

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:39.844
MAYBE SAYING NO WAIT MAY BE

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.513
PUSHING IT OFF FOR A PERIOD O

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:44.849
TIME. I WANT TO RAISE THE

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:47.185
CONCERN THAT THE P. YOU SEE AND

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.853
THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.955
THEY NEED TO BE BUREAUCRACIES

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.925
THAT. SMOOTHED OUT THIS PROCESS

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:56.694
GET THE DETERMINATIONS DONE AND

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.230
GET THE THAT THE MONEY INTO THE

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.166
- IT INTO PLACES WHERE IT NEEDS

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:03.101
TO BE. AND WE NEED TO REMIND

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.170
OURSELVES S. B. ONE FIVE SIX WAS

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:08.907
VERY CLEAR SURE THE UNSERVED.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.275
AND I THINK IF WE MISS THAT

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:12.577
OPPORTUNITY IF WE'RE BOGGED DOWN

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.612
IN SOME OF THIS BUREAUCRATIC

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.849
DECISION MAKING. AND OF THE P.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.817
YOU SEE TAKES UPON ITSELF SOME.

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:22.086
OF THE DESIRE TO HEAD IN A

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:22.854
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:25.190
DIRECTION THAN WHAT SB ONE FIVE

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:27.759
SIX WAS VERY CLEAR. WE MAY ENTER

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.861
INTO A TIME WHERE WE WASTE A LOT

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:32.597
OF MONEY. WE CAN'T DRAW DOWN ALL

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.032
THE FEDERAL MONEY OUT BECAUSE OF

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.833
IT AND I THINK WE GOT TO BE VERY

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.468
VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW THESE

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.804
BUREAUCRACIES GET US TO THE

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.574
FINISH LINE. THEY NEED TO BE

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.875
STREAMLINED THEY NEED TO BE

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.944
EFFICIENT THEY NEED TO GET US TO

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.346
THE PLACE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.815
PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:53.585
CONSTRUCTING DOING IT- WITH THE

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:56.487
VERY LATEST TECHNOLOGY. I HOPE

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.890
THAT AT THE END OF ALL OF THIS.

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.959
AND I HOPE IT'S SOON. WE WILL

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.127
SEE THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.696
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE WILL

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:08.199
BE ABLE TO SAY. WE'VE DONE IT SO

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.068
LET'S DO IT AND LET'S NOT LET

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.937
BARACK CHRISSY'S GET IN THE WAY.

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:16.674
AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE AN

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:17.275
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE I APPLAUD

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.877
THE CHAIR. FOR HER WILLINGNESS

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:21.980
TO TAKE ON THE OVERSIGHT ROLE OF

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.048
THIS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:24.816
WERE HERE. AND SO WILL COME

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:28.186
BACK. SEVERAL MORE TIMES. AND WE

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:30.288
WILL CHECK ON THE PROGRESS AND

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:33.725
I'M HOPING. THAT WE'VE MADE THE

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:34.859
PROGRESS CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.128
MAKE. AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY SEE

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.163
THAT PROGRESS TAKE PLACE. THIS

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.865
IS A GOLDEN MOMENT AND

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:41.699
CALIFORNIA IS STANDING AT A

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:44.636
CROSSROADS. LET'S DO IT NOT NOT

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.904
NO NOT WAIT NOT MAYBE LET'S DO

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:49.774
IT. NOW GET IT DONE WE HAVE THE

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:50.975
MONEY WE HAVE THE WHERE WITH

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.478
ALL. MY CONCERN IS WHEN THEY RUN

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:55.613
OUT OF TIME. BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.515
THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT. SO

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.883
LET'S RUN OUR SLEEVES UP. THOSE

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.285
THAT ARE INVOLVED BOTH FROM THE

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:01.119
PUBLIC SECTOR THE PRIVATE

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:03.154
SECTOR. LET'S AGREE THAT THIS IS

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.689
GOING TO BE THE TIME WE END THE

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:08.826
DIGITAL FIVE. THANK YOU AND I'M

INTERNET IS A NECESSITY IN

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.431
TODAY'S LIFE IT ISN'T SOMETHING

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:48.199
THAT WE THINK SOME PEOPLE

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.967
DESERVE AND OTHERS DON'T OR SOME

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:51.636
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE AND OTHERS

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.504
DON'T NEED IT. WE'VE SEEN IT

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:54.906
WITH THE STUDENTS YEAH DURING

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:57.875
COVERT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY

FOR TELEWORK IT AND SO MANY

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:11.089
THINGS IT IS NOT A LUXURY IT IS

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:14.559
ABSOLUTELY. A REQUIREMENT FOR

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:17.095
MODERN LIFE. THE I AGREE WITH MY

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.830
COLLEAGUES THAT WE FINALLY GET

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:21.499
THE MONEY. NOW WE'VE GOT TO DO

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.067
THE HARD WORK AND HAVING THIS

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:26.671
OVERSIGHT- HEARING IS THAT IT'S

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:29.107
VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP- I

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.775
APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT AYE AYE I

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.744
AM VERY PROUD AS YOU'VE SAID.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.211
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:34.946
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:37.048
INVESTING SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.449
AND I THINK THAT THIS COULD DO

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:41.219
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SET OUT TO

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.387
DO AND THAT IS TO CLOSE THE

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.088
DIGITAL DIVIDE. THERE ARE THE

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.189
THREE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.457
ALWAYS LOOK AT IT THAT IS

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:49.360
ACCESSIBILITY. RELIABILITY AND

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:52.730
AFFORDABILITY. IT ACCESSIBILITY

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:53.564
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:55.199
MIDDLE MILE IS SOMETHING THAT

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:00.738
SURE THAT EVEN FOR THOSE WHO

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.774
HAVE ACCESSIBILITY. IF THE

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.142
INTERNET CONNECTION IS NOT

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:06.377
RELIABLE OR IF IT IS NOT

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:08.045
AFFORDABLE IT'S AS IF THEY HAD

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:10.281
NO INTERNET CONNECTION. AND THAT

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:11.449
IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT WE

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:13.151

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.366
SOME VALUE IN LOOKING AT THOSE

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:32.402

RESPECT TO SOME OF THE AREAS- I

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.510

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:39.269
WORKING TOGETHER AND ALL OF

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:42.339
THAT- THAT BECOMES A REAL

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.307
CHALLENGE I THINK TO MOVE OUR

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.276
OUR FUNDS QUICKLY AND IN A WAY

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:48.278
WHERE WE DON'T DEBT. WE DON'T

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:50.013
USE THEM IN TIME SO WE LOSE THEM

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.449
AYE AYE I WANNA RAISE THIS AGAIN

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:55.118
THAT THE OPERATIONAL. SCHMOOZING

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:57.754
THIS HAS TO BE A PART OF THIS

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.823
OUR EXPECTATION NEEDS TO BE.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.324
THAT THEY'RE SAYING YES WE CAN

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:03.760
DO THIS HERE'S WHERE WE WANT TO

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:06.296
GET IT DONE. I'M ALS I DO HOW I

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.231
AM HEARING THAT THE SECOND GO

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.367
AROUND. OF THAT WE GET PAST THE

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:14.237
EIGHTEEN. IS NOT GOING TO FOCUS-

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:15.806
SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UNDERSERVED

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.641
AREAS AND SOME OF THE RURAL

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:20.210
AREAS A LITTLE MORE. EFFECTIVELY

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:22.679
I THINK SO I WANT TO APPRECIATE

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:27.250
THAT- AND- MY VOICE HERE WILL.

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.885
WILL BE FOR THOSE AREAS THAT ARE

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:30.921
REALLY UNDERSERVED VERY

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:32.689
EXPENSIVE TO GET TO THAT TO THAT

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.525
LAST MILE THE MIDDLE MILE HELPS

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.894
BUT AT THE END OF ALL OF THIS. I

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:40.163
HAVE A LOT OF. SCHOOLS THAT

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.198
DON'T HAVE INTERNET OUT IN THE

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.632
RURAL AREAS A LOT OF

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.134
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS THAT

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:47.370
CANNOT CONNECT- AND A LOT OF

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:48.572
PEOPLE IN THE IN THE INTERFACE

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:51.608
BETWEEN THE OF THAT WILD. FIRE

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:54.344
AREAS AND THE URBAN URBANIZATION

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.645
AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CONCERNS

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:58.181
OVER RELIABILITY IN THOSE KINDS

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.182
OF THINGS SO. I REALLY

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:02.385
APPRECIATE. WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.955
I DO WANT TO REMIND US THAT SB

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:05.989
ONE FIVE SIX REALLY WAS VERY

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.524
CLEAR ABOUT THE UNSERVED AREAS

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:08.959
AND I THINK WE GOT TO MAKE SURE

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:10.427
THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING.

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:12.596
WE'RE NOT OVERBUILDING AND THAT

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:15.065
WE'RE GETTING IT DONE BECAUSE I

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:15.699
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIMITED

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:18.268
RESOURCES WITH A VERY. BIG PRICE

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.737
TAG AND SO I'M HOPING BY THE END

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.506
OF THE DAY. WILL BE ABLE TO SIT

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.975
HERE AND SAY WE GET IT- INSTEAD

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.011
OF WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY.

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.746
DID THIS TURN INTO A- THE

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.548
BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE THAT-

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:34.050
MADE BIG PROMISES BUT COULDN'T

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:34.851
KEEP THOSE PROMISES TO THE

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:37.187
PEOPLE. OUT WE DO HAVE

00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:39.256
BUREAUCRACIES IN THE STATE. THAT

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.657
HAVE OPERATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:42.058
THEY HAVE MADE BIG PROMISES AND

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.227
IF NOT PERFORMED. AND I BELIEVE

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.529
THAT PART OF THE CONCERNED WE

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:47.330
OUGHT TO BE RACING HERE. IS THAT

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.566
WE HAVE THE P. YOU SEE AND WE

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.601
HAVE THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF-

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:54.504
TECHNOLOGY. AND MY EXPERIENCE

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:57.407
HERE. HAS BEEN. THAT THOSE TWO

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:00.577
ENTITIES ARE. SOMETIMES LESS

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:02.579
THAN RELIABLE. AND I THINK WE'VE

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:05.215
GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND BE A

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:07.117
CHEERLEADER NOT JUST A POINTING

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.318
FINGER BUT A CHEERLEADER FOR

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.921

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.489
STREAMLINED WAY IN A WAY THAT

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:14.024
SAYS YES NOT NO WAITER MAY BE.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:17.527

CONSENSUS HERE THAT. WE CAN MOVE

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.733

ESTIMATED TO BE ENOUGH BUILD A

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:11.278
SIX THE TO A HEN. MILE SIXTY OF

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:12.379
THE EIGHT THEY'LL MILES THIS.

01:49:12.445 --> 01:49:13.914
ACCORDING TO THE ALEJO'S REPORT

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.348
THE FIRST EIGHT PROJECTS THAT

HAVE BEEN A- ACCOUNT FOR EIGHT

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:20.854
TO NINE HUNDRED MILES. IT IS MY

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.322
INFORMATION CORRECT AND ARE WE

GOING TO BE ON TRACK TO DO OUR

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:28.795
SIX THOUSAND MILES. YES REALLY

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:30.330
HOW THE WAY THAT THE SIX

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.998
THOUSAND MILES WAS DETERMINED

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:35.502
WAS- AN INITIAL ESTIMATE BY-

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.437
CALTRANS IS LESS BRING IN TERMS

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:39.039
OF WHAT THESE PROJECTS THAT SOME

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.874
SMALLER PROJECTS ACOSTA IN THE

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:44.210
PAST. WE AND SO WE NORMALLY ASK

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.912
OF THAT THE WAY CALTRANS IN ANY

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:46.880
OF ITS PROJECTS THAT WOULD

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:49.683
DEVELOP ITS COST ESTIMATES- IT

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:50.850
WOULD DO IT KIND OF STARTS WITH

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:53.053
THE A PROJECT INITIATION- A

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.255
DOCUMENT. PROCESS YOU KNOW HOW

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:57.457
WE PROJECTS TAKE A LOT LONGER-

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:58.191
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT MORE

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:00.994
INVOLVED IN THIS- AND SO. THEY

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.762
WERE GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT

01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:04.931
PROCESS- TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:07.801
COSTS WOULD BE AND SO- IT

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:09.002
BECAUSE OF THE ACCELERATED

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:10.670
NATURE OF THIS PROJECT GOT

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.772
CALTRANS ACTUALLY DOING THAT AS

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:14.607
PART OF TE PRECONSTRUCTION-

01:50:14.674 --> 01:50:16.576
PROCESS AND SO THEY ARE.

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:19.312
CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THESE THESE

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:20.613
EIGHTEEN PROJECTS AND REFINING

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.781
THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT THE COST

01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:28.154
WILL. BE SO- DR BROADLEAF. THE

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:31.891
OTHER SICK THOUSAND IS. YOU KNOW

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:32.993
. AGAIN AT THE KIND OF THAT

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:35.261
INITIAL HIGH- DISCUSSION WERE

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:38.832
HOPE THAT THE AS WE MOVE. IF A

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:42.168
BILL TO ACHIEVE. A SAVINGS-

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:44.270
ENERGY FOR YOU KNOW SORT OF

01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.373
SCALE- AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:47.340
COMPONENTS WERE LOOKING AT TO BE

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:49.609
ABLE TO MAYBE DRAW DOWN THOSE

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:50.243
COSTS THE BUILDING OR- BUT IT'S

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:52.479
REALLY THAT THAT THE AND- OF US

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:56.082
ONE FIFTY. ONE TO. AS MUCH AS

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:57.250
POSSIBLE BUILD OUT A OWNED

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.085
SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:01.421
PHONE- BUT- THAT THAT WOULD COME

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:04.758
. A BASED INITIAL- PROBABLY

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:09.462
CLOSER TO FOUR BILLION. THIS SB

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:12.532
ONE SIX- CD T. TWO. TO FILL IN

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:14.968
THE REST OF THE SYSTEM USING THE

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:16.336
AGREEMENT. AND LYFT QUESTION I

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:19.506
MAY I ASK EARLY. AND I AM YOU.

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:21.708
THAT ARE THE PER TO ASK MR ONE.

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:22.876
WHAT IS THE ESTÁ CALL OF THOSE

01:51:22.942 --> 01:51:24.110
EIGHT PRODUCT THAT OF ALL BEEN.

01:51:24.177 --> 01:51:30.817
APPROVED IN RELATION TO THE.

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:32.552
THREE POINT TWO SIX BILLION. SO

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:36.990
ON A BRITISH- WHAT I CAN DO IS

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.425
ON OF THE THAT THE NATIONAL WHEN

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:39.926
WE PUT THE- THIS PROPOSAL LAST

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:42.195
SUMMER- I WANT TO SAY IT'S A- IT

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.663
IT WITH BE THE THREE EIGHTY

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:45.832
MILLION RANGE THAT IT'S A VERY

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:46.900
HIGH LEVEL THAT IS VERY

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.602
PRELIMINARY AND PART OF AGAIN

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:51.204
THE REASON I WANT TO CARRY OUT

01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:52.705
THAT IS THAT CALTRANS IS GOING

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.174
THROUGH THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.043
OF REALLY REFINING THAT NUMBER

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:58.578
THAT. AND THAT'S- I WANNA MAKE

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.747
SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT-

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:03.216
SIMILARLY THAT ASSUMES THAT WE

01:52:03.283 --> 01:52:06.252
ARE- BUILDING- ALL EIGHT HUNDRED

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:07.253
YOU KNOW ROUGHLY A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.123
MILES- AND- PART OF THE

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:11.357
ASSESSMENT WE'RE DOING IS TO GO

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:12.859
BACK AND SEE WHERE WHERE. WHERE

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.994
MIGHT WE LINK UP WITH EXISTING

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:17.497
INFRASTRUCTURE- YOU KNOW AND SO

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:18.865
THOSE ARE ALL THE PROCESSES THAT

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:20.667
WE'RE GOING THROUGH SO. IF WE

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:22.702
WERE TO JUST ASSUME. ON A

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:23.837
STRAIGHT LINE THAT WE'RE HERE

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:24.337
THAT WE'RE BAY THEY WERE

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:25.772
BUILDING ALL EIGHT HUNDRED AND

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:27.440
FIFTY MILES. THEN YOU KNOW ONE

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:30.210
COULD ESTIMATE THE THREE

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:31.511
HUNDRED. SEVENTY FIVE THREE

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:32.979
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:33.913
RANGE. BUT AGAIN THAT'S STILL

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:37.784
BEING THAT. THAT'S BE REFINED BY

NUMBER EIGHTEEN AS RIVERSIDE SAN

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:56.789

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:01.761
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT AND

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:02.962
ONE THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:04.998
MAYBE I MISSED HEARD BUT WHEN WE

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:06.666
WERE GIVEN THE EXAMPLE OF THE

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:07.767
MIDDLE MILE PROJECT IN NEVADA

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:10.403
COUNTY I BELIEVE SOMEBODY SAID

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:13.773
THAT A SUPERVISOR HAD SUGGESTED.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.943
THIS ROUTE. AND I THINK THAT'S I

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.144
MEAN IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS I

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:19.212
SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN AND I

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:20.513
SHOULD REQUEST THE STUFF

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.347
OCEANSIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:55:21.414 --> 01:55:23.316
DONUT HOLE IN OCEANSIDE. SO I

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:25.518
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:26.519
THAT ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WERE

01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:28.554
FUNDING. ARE OBJECTIVELY MEETING

01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:32.191
THE CRITERIA AND NOT JUST- A

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:33.593
PROJECT THAT SERVES ONE

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.461
SUPERVISOR NEVADA COUNTY VERSUS

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:38.064
ACTUALLY SATISFYING. THE

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:39.432
REQUIREMENTS SET OUT THE BILL.

01:55:39.499 --> 01:55:40.867
SO MAYBE COULD SOMEBODY COULD GO

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:43.002
THROUGH. EXACTLY HOW THESE

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:45.672
EIGHTEEN WERE CHOSEN. AND MAYBE

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:46.406
LESS OF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:47.740
RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO BECAUSE I

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:49.108
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:50.777
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT.

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:52.111
AND THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:53.479
HAVE THAT YOU CAN ANSWER WITH

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:57.950
IT. IS- WHAT METRICS ARE YOU

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:00.520
USING TO SHOW THAT THESE

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:02.088
EIGHTEEN PROJECTS ARE THE BEST

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:04.157

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.160
CRITERIA THE FROM THE BILL BUT

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:09.128
YOU MUST AVE THE METRICS OF

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:10.530
SUCCESS TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:12.665
BANG FOR A BUCK RIGHT SO CAN

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:13.900
SOMEBODY GO THROUGH THOSE TWO

01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:15.935
THINGS BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED.

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:18.871
THAT YOU KNOW. WHAT THAT MAYBE

01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:20.039
WE'RE NOT HAVING THE BEST

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:21.641
OBJECTIVE PROJECTS FOR OUR STATE

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:23.976

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:28.681

OVERALL PROJECT AND SO. MAYBE IT

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.862
AN IMPORTANT THING TO POINT OUT

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:43.796
IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:56:43.863 --> 01:56:45.565

WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC COMMENT

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:34.487
THE PUBLIC COMMENT MAP IS A

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:36.188
PUBLIC COMMENT MAP IT IS NOT

CONNECT WITH THE EXISTING

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.097
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH- GOLDEN

02:03:58.164 --> 02:04:00.533
STATE NOT- BUT I DON'T WANT IT

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:02.635
YOU KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF THE

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:03.269
INITIAL EIGHTEEN WASN'T TO SAY

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:05.037
THESE WORDS. THE HIGHEST

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:06.672
PRIORITY. THAT THE STATE WILL

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:08.741
COME UP WITH. THAT HAD THAT AT

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.342
THAT POINT THAT ASSESSMENT

02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:11.744
HADN'T REALLY BEEN DONE SO FAR-

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:12.545
WASN'T COMPLETED UNTIL THE

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:14.180
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS

02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:15.681
CONTINUING. JERRY OKAY LET'S

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:17.116
CONTINUE TO DO THEIR ANALYSIS

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:20.653
AND- AND THIS WAS AN AREA WERE.

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:22.755
NEED WAS IDENTIFIED AND THAT'S

02:04:22.822 --> 02:04:29.094
REALLY WHY IT IT AND. THE OTHER

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:29.728
PROJECTS WERE SELECTED. I WOULD

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:30.696
. SUGGEST THAT WE CREATE. GOING

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.998
FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND THESE WERE

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:34.166
ONES THAT CAN BE DONE NOW NEVER

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.035
SYNERGIES. BUT GOING FORWARD FOR

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:37.937
THE REST OF THE MONEY. I THINK

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:38.871
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:40.372
HAVE. WHAT OUR METRICS OF

02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:42.541
SUCCESS WHY ARE WE USING IT HERE

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.109
AND NOT THERE BECAUSE- THERE'S

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.311
PROBABLY MORE THAT WE NEED TO

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:47.346
DO. THAT BEYOND THE NUMBER OF

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:49.248
DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE A SIGN AND

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:50.883
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:52.518
TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. AND SAY.

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:53.419
THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR A

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:55.421
BUCK. WE ARE INVESTING. OUR

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:57.890
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WISELY. RIGHT

02:04:57.957 --> 02:04:59.425
AS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU COME

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.793
UP WITH METRICS SO THAT THE NEXT

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.994

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:05.264
EACH OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE CAN

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:06.198
SAY. IS THE BEST BANG FOR A BUCK

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:07.833
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.835

UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS- I WOULD

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:38.030
SAY I THINK SOME OF THE- CONCERN

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:38.898
YOU'RE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:42.568

02:09:07.739 --> 02:09:09.074
WHAT YOU'RE AFTER THAT IS WHAT

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:10.976
YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON HALF OF

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:12.644
THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE IN THE ROOM

02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:14.513
AND HALF OF THOSE ARE URBAN BUT

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:15.781
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:17.850
PROBLEMS ARE IN THE RURAL AREA

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:19.251
YOU HAVE LACK OF DENSITY AND

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:21.520
HOME SPREAD OUT FOR PARTNERS

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:22.421
THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONNECTIVITY

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:24.490
OUT THERE. IN AN URBAN SEARCH

02:09:24.556 --> 02:09:26.558
AND CENTER YOU HAVE POCKETS IT'S

02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:28.460
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CHALLENGE

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:29.428
IT'S ONE THAT DOESN'T

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:31.196
NECESSARILY REQUIRE MIDDLE MILE

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:33.031
IT REQUIRES BUILDING UP THAT

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:34.299
LAST MILE TO THESE UNSERVED

02:09:34.366 --> 02:09:36.201
POCKETS SO YOU CAN GO WITH A

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:38.103
VERY COSTLY APPROACH OF

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:39.471
DUPLICATING MIDDLE MILE AND

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:41.607
URBAN AREA. BUT REALLY THE

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:42.908
CHALLENGES IS GETTING TO THAT

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:44.776
LAST MILE HOUSEHOLD SO SOME OF

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:46.345
THESE POCKETS OR LIKE PUBLIC

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.280
HOUSING. IT WAS LOCAL

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:49.781
GOVERNMENTS DECISION NOT TO

02:09:49.848 --> 02:09:51.550
BUILD BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IN

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:52.951
THOSE UNITS WHEN THEY WERE BUILT

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:54.353
SO SOMETHING MIGHT LOOK AT IN

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:55.254
THE FUTURE TO REQUIRE PUBLIC

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.422
HOUSING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE

02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:58.357
BILL PUBLIC HOUSE AND THEY HAVE

02:09:58.423 --> 02:10:02.127
IT SOME OF THEM MAY BE- TRAILER

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:04.496
PARKS- MOBILE HOME PARKS SO THAT

02:10:04.563 --> 02:10:05.731
THE PROPERTY OWNER DO NOT A LOT

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:07.232
SO YOU HAVE SOME PROPERTY RIGHTS

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:08.167
ISSUES THAT YOU NEED TO BE

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:09.635
CHARGED WITH. FIRST CONNECTIVITY

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.270
OUT IN THE STREET SO YOUR CHILD

02:10:11.336 --> 02:10:13.205
FROM URBAN RURAL IS GONNA BE

02:10:13.272 --> 02:10:15.140
DIFFERENT FOR UNSERVED OF MORE

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:16.775
IMPORTANTLY IN THE URBAN AREAS

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.310
WHEN I THINK A LOT OF

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:19.077
LEGISLATORS STOP THAT THEY

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:21.146
DIDN'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY AND OUR

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:23.282
HELP LOS ANGELES AREA. IT WAS

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.150
NOT THAT THERE WASN'T A SERVICER

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.318
BUT THERE WAS NO PORTABILITY

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.853
ISSUE OR THE HOUSE OF DIDN'T

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:33.158
ADOPT SO THERE'S. ONE POINT NINE

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:33.759
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT COULD

02:10:33.825 --> 02:10:35.427
NOT BROADBAND. BUT DID SOLEIL.

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:38.864
CC SPONSOR TWO PIECES ALLEGE. TO

02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:40.532
GET. A K. TWELVE STUDENTS

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:41.633
CONNECTED TO GET PUBLIC HOUSING

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:43.569
AND CONNECTED. UNFORTUNATELY

02:10:43.635 --> 02:10:44.670
RUSTIC SESIL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.104
TO. YOU KNOW ADDRESSING THOSE

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:48.340
ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT'S

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:50.676
YOUR CHALLENGE HOW TO GET TO

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:51.810
THESE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.078
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. SIX BILLION

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:54.780
DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY SO

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:56.882
YOU NEED TO USE IT WISELY. WE

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.283
WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU

02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:00.419
FOCUS ON THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:01.820
ARE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE IN

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.288
THREE. SO THAT SHOULD BE YOUR

02:11:03.355 --> 02:11:06.391
TARGET- AND LASTLY I WANT TO

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:08.994
MENTION ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:09.995
DIFFERENT PILOT PROJECTS. MIDDLE

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:11.763
MILE PROJECTS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.032
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL-

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:15.934
I THINK IN THE FUTURE. THE

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:17.302
COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO DRILL DOWN

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:19.071
ON SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS. THERE

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:20.472
WAS THE THREE NINETY FIVE

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:21.840
DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE THAT

02:11:21.907 --> 02:11:23.642
GOES FROM BARSTOW TO RENO IT

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:25.577
COST A BILLION DOLLARS. IN YOU

02:11:25.644 --> 02:11:27.846
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:28.880
HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED IN THOSE

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:30.983
PROJECTS AND IN THAT PROJECT. SO

02:11:31.049 --> 02:11:31.817
IT GOES THROUGH FIVE

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.086
RESERVATIONS I'VE HEARD THAT-

02:11:34.152 --> 02:11:35.287
THE HEAD OFFICE WILL HAVE

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:36.288
CONNECTIVITY BUT THE ACTUAL

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:37.856
HOUSEHOLDS ON THOSE RESERVATIONS

02:11:37.923 --> 02:11:40.626
DO NOT. SO I WOULD GO DOWN ON

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.694
THAT PROJECT FOR THE TWO NINETY

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:43.562
NINE DIGITAL TO NINE NINE

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:45.998
PROJECT THAT GOES FROM- EUREKA

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:48.433
OVER TO REDDING COTTON WOOD. AND

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.468
THAT WAS A FORTY EIGHT MILLION

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:50.669
DOLLAR PROJECT. IT WAS VERY

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:52.771
EXPENSIVE THE PROPONENT WANTED

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:54.206
TO DOUBLE THAT SO HE SAID THAT

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:55.941
WAS NOT ENOUGH SO THAT PROJECT

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:58.777
FAILED. SO WE HAVE PROJECTS HERE

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:00.178
IN CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T NEED TO

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.481
GO YOU DON'T NEED TO DO PILOTS

02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:03.482
SO MUCH YOU NEED TO GO DRILL

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:05.083
DOWN AND LEARN AND TAKE THE

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:05.651
LEARNING LESSONS FROM THOSE

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:08.587
PROJECTS. AND I WILL LEAVE IT

02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:09.788
OPEN IT ONE LAST SHOT OUT TO A

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:11.523
CALTRANS. SO CALTRANS HAS BEEN A

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:13.125
GREAT PARTNER IN THE PAST SO I

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:14.393
THINK MR WHICH NOT HERE BUT

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:16.161

WORK WITH IS PIECE AND WE HAVE

02:12:20.198 --> 02:12:21.366
MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THAT

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:25.637
AREA. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU.

BEFORE THAT I WAS WORKING IN

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:22.194

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.262
WEST SIDE. AND OTHER TECHNICIANS

02:13:24.329 --> 02:13:26.331
WORKING IN THE SAID WE'RE STILL

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:28.233
. TWO BRAND NEW SUBDIVISIONS

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.669
COPPER NETWORKS THAT ARE LIKE

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.037
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THE

02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:34.506

SPEED OF ABOUT. SIXTY TEN MAGS

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:39.511
STILL BUILDING IT RIGHT NOW. I

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:42.114
JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT- YOU KNOW.

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.182
I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:47.452
HONOR THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. OF

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:50.188
LIKE WHAT WAS. SPARKED THE

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:51.456
DEPLOYMENT OF RURAL

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.558
ELECTRIFICATION. AND THE

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:55.560
TELEPHONE SERVICE IT'S GOT TO BE

02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:57.529
UNIVERSAL UNIVERSAL SERVICE.

02:13:57.596 --> 02:13:59.297
IT'S ALSO GOT TO BE A SERVICE

02:13:59.364 --> 02:14:02.100
WHICH HAS TO LIE ON A DURABLE

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:05.637
NETWORK AND THAT NETWORK- IN OUR

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.973
VIEWS AS A TECHNICIAN HAS TO BE

02:14:08.039 --> 02:14:09.841
AN OPTICAL FIBER NETWORK. AN

02:14:09.908 --> 02:14:11.576
OPTICAL FIBRE BACKBONE WILL

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:13.545
SERVE YOU FOR GENERATIONS MAY

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:15.814
COST MORE TO BUILD TAKE A LITTLE

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:17.115
LONGER BUT IN THE END. YOU'RE

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:19.184
DONE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:23.054
NATURAL DISASTERS AND- THOSE

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:24.156
LITTLE CRITTERS CALLED SQUIRRELS

02:14:24.222 --> 02:14:25.791
. YES THEY WREAK HAVOC ON A

02:14:25.857 --> 02:14:27.492
NETWORK BUT THERE'S A SOLUTION

02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:29.161
YOU KNOW YOU HARDEN THE NETWORK

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:30.629
YOU HARDEN THE AERIALS YOU

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.664
UNDERGROUND WHERE YOU CAN. I'VE

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.032
SEEN UNDERGROUNDING GOING ON BUT

02:14:34.099 --> 02:14:36.635
IT. THESE COMPANIES THEY DON'T

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:37.836
WANNA UNDERGROUND THEY DON'T

02:14:37.903 --> 02:14:39.738
WANT TO HAVE THE EXPENSE. I'VE

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:40.772
BEEN IN PLACERVILLE WHERE THERE

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:42.541
UNDERGROUNDING CONDUIT IN THE

02:14:42.607 --> 02:14:45.143
FIRE AREAS. YOU SEE THAT

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:46.912
TELEPHONE POLES WITH THE

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:49.147
TELEPHONE WIRE CRISSCROSSING THE

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:50.449
ROAD FIFTY FEET FROM WHERE THE

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:52.117
UNDERGROUNDING IS GOING ON IN

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:54.352
THE REFUSING TO DO IT. BUT LET

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:55.554
ME GET BACK TO ANOTHER PROBLEM

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:58.156
WHICH IS. IT'S SUCH A HUGE

02:14:58.223 --> 02:14:59.291
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD THIS

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:01.393
BIGGEST ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:03.361
MY LIFETIME PROBABLY WE DON'T

02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:05.063
HAVE THE TECHNICIANS TO DO IT

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:07.365
AND SO MANY CASES WORKERS TRYING

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:09.468
TO BUILD A PARTNERSHIPS WITH

02:15:09.534 --> 02:15:11.636
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE TRYING

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:14.172
TO START TO BUILD THE CAPACITY

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:15.474
WITH SOME OF THE VOCATIONAL

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:16.441
TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO HELP

02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:18.009
PEOPLE GET QUICKLY INTO THOSE

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:20.111
JOBS WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:22.814
IF YOU GO TO THE JOB WEBSITES

02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:25.183
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TECHNICIANS

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:27.018
THE TECHNICIANS OF US THAT ARE

02:15:27.085 --> 02:15:28.420
THERE ARE OVERLOADED WE CAN'T

02:15:28.487 --> 02:15:30.455
KEEP UP WITH THE DAY TO DAY WORK

02:15:30.522 --> 02:15:31.623
LET ALONE VANDERBILTS AND LET

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.426
ALONE THIS HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:15:34.493 --> 02:15:37.062
PROJECTS SO I JUST HOPE THAT YOU

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:39.564
WOULD TAKE THIS AND LET'S GO

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.900
WITH IT AND PARTNER WITH US TO

02:15:41.967 --> 02:15:43.735
THE EXTENT WITH WHOEVER IS OUT

02:15:43.802 --> 02:15:45.704
THERE DEVELOPING THE CAPACITY

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.772
WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:48.974
STRENGTHEN THE VOCATIONAL

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:49.808
TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THOSE

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.710
PIPELINES AND THEN EVENTUALLY

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.112
BRING THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND
