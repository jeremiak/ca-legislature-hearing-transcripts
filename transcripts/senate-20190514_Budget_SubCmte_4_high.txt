THAT'S PART OF THE LARGER DISPOSITION PROCESS OF VIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER LOCATED IN COSTA MESA CALIFORNIA. THE STAFF REPORT ACCURATELY DEPICTS THE SITE IS -- ON APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED TEN ACRES HUNDRED SIXTEEN BUILDINGS THIS FIRST STEP IS REALLY JUST TO ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SITE SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF DETERMINE POTENTIAL FUTURE USES AND WORK ON THAT PROCESS WITH STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED JUST AS WE DID WITH SOME -- SO. REPORTER QUEST TO GET EVERYTHING GOING. AND START. THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY DETERMINE WHAT'S ON SITE AND WHAT THE OPTIONS. BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY [inaudible] LEO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS FINANCE. ON SU SUPER FINANCE WE DEPART BOZELL. OKAY WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE [inaudible] A MONTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STAFF. JORDAN LINDSAY WITH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIAN YORK UNITED THROUGH POLICY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE. AS WELL TODAY I'M REPRESENT THE LANHAM COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN TWENTY STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A KID REPRESENT THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP THE DISABILITIES SERVED. BY REGIONAL CENTERS -- AND RECEIVING SERVICES GUARANTEED UNDER THE LANHAM ACT. I'M THE THREE REMAINING AVAILABLE CENTERS THE FORTY HEARD ONE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO REGARDING SOME A DEVELOPMENT CENTER. AND THIS AND THEN REMAIN AT THE HEART OF PORTER FILM. REPRESENT THE LAST REAL OPPORTUNITY THAT WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS TO GET THIS RIGHT. IN TO GET IT RIGHT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP TO THAT'S DISABILITIES MEANS THAT THESE ASSETS ARE NOTCHES. TO BE USED TO GENERATE FUNDS FOR THE GENERAL FUND BUT INSTEAD ARE USED TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPED TO DISABILITIES. WE HAVE A THERE WAS A BUDGET PROPOSAL LAST YEAR THERE IS A BILL LAST YEAR AND A BILL THIS YEAR AS WELL PROPOSING THAT NGUYEN READ IN THE STATE RECEIVES REVENUE FROM THESE THREE ASSETS. AT THAT REVENUE IS AS THESE ASSETS USED TO BE. LARGE INSTITUTIONAL HOUSING THAT NOW IT FUNDS SMALL INTEGRATED RESIDENTIAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPS A DISABILITIES IT IS NO SECRET AND AS A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE MORE OPPORTUNE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO CALIFORNIA THIS IS A WAY TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY FOR A POPULATION WHO FACES THIS. DISCRIMINATION AND EXTREME CHALLENGES MOSTLY JUST BASED ON AS A SIZE OF P. AND COME TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE DO NOT. WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH HOW THE LOCALITIES OR WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE PROPERTIES. EXCEPT THAT IN THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AS WAS IN CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. THERE WAS -- PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THEY SHOULD MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THAT ANY YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR DEVOTED ACTUAL S. TIME FOR CINEMA. TO PRESENT MORE MONEY TO THE TO CINEMA COUNTY TO TO TO DEVELOP A PLANNING PROCESS BUT THAT IT SHOULD MAXIMIZE THE VALUE. WE BELIEVE THE SAME SHOULD BE DONE WITH FAIR USE THAT IT SHOULD MAXIMIZE THE VALUE SO THAT WHEN DISPOSITION DOES HAPPEN. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO SEE DISPOSITION HAPPEN WHETHER THAT'S A SAILOR LEASE. THAT THE REVENUE CAN THEN BE GENERATED INTO WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSES A CULT AN INTEGRATED COMMUNITY HOUSING FUND. AT THEHOUSING COMMITTEE DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. MMHM DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO CREATE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALSO LASTLY. WE DO QUOTE COVER NEWSOME WHEN HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. THE REVENUE THAT COULD BE GENERATED FROM THESE ASSETS QUOTE WE MARK THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT LOST OPPORTUNITIES IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO. IN ORANGE COUNTY THERE ARE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THREE POINT THREE MILLION IDEAS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH. SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT WHICH OF THOSE USES ARE GOING TO BE ANALYZED NO JUDGE CARTER HAS. SOME IDEAS THE COUNTY HAS SOME IDEAS. LEGISLATORS PROPOSALS. SO IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT SENATOR -- THERE ARE CERTAINLY LOTS OF IDEAS AND CERTAINLY NOT THE POTENTIAL USES THE ASK BEFORE YOU TODAY IS JUST. TO ANALYZE THE SITE. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY SIMILAR ITS FIRST STEP THAT WE TOOK WITH CINNAMON WHERE BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT. IT. SO WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE SITE WHAT IS THE CONDITION THE BUILDINGS WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT ARE THE HAZARDS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I MEAN WOMEN. AND SOME IS ACTUALLY GREAT CASE STUDY IN THE THINGS WE FOUND THE WAY TO DECIDE ASSESSMENT THAT HELP INFORM. COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE STATE IN THE REGION ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT. SO THIS FIRST STEP IS REALLY DETERMINE WHAT. CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS ARE WHICH WOULD. FORM THAT YOU TO DISCUSS ABOUT WHAT. BUT DON'T YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHATEVER EXIST RIGHT NOW WHAT MAKES THIS IN THE FUTURE DON'T YOU NEED TO TO KIND OF KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAY EXIST IN THE FUTURE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT. FOR EXAMPLE THE THE SOIL -- BUILDING THAT KIND OF THING. YES I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK IT I THINK WE'RE SAYING THIS. OKAY SAME THING I MEAN PART PART OF THE INITIAL SITE ASSESSMENT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE A REASONABLE DEAL -- GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TERM IN NOW IF THERE'S A CLEAN UP NEEDS ON THE SITE OR WATER ISSUES ON THE SITE OR INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL THAT IS KIND OF THE BASE LEVEL INFORMATION YOU NEED TO HAVE. TO REALLY HAVE A HEARTY DISCUSSION ABOUT IT COULD WE DO WHAT SIZE BUILDINGS COULD BE THERE WHAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE IT WILL BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE CURRENTLY. ON THE CAMPUS. ALL OF THE SITE ASSESSMENT WORK. WORMS THAT THAT SUCH. SO ARE YOU INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY IN. A DEVELOPING THE PLAN FOR THE SITE ASSESSMENT. NOW ONCE ONCE. MUCH LIKE ANDERS SAID ONCE WE CAN GET OUR GET A HANDLE ON EXACTLY WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE THE SOIL THAT WASTE WATER WHAT HAVE YOU. WILL BE A LARGER STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LOCALS AND ANY STATE ENTITIES SO THE SITE ASSESSMENTS I MEAN IT'S PRETTY STANDARD PRACTICE RATES ARE GONNA HAVE A TEAM GO AND ANALYZE THE QUALITY OF THE BUILDINGS STATUS BOTH BUILDINGS ANALYZE UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THIS ON THE CAMPUS LOOK FOR POTENTIAL ISSUES OF GEOLOGY -- HAZARDOUS WASTE ALL THE GUY KIND OF GIVE THE WHOLE LAY OF THE LAND THE PICTURE OF WHAT THE CAMPUS IS AND WHAT'S ON THEIR DAY. THOSE ACTIONS AND STEPS ARE PRETTY STANDARD EYES. BUT WE WILL BE BRINGING IN THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND MAKING ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO START THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT. OKAY SO WITH THE END OF THE DAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY YES WE CAN BUILD A PRESCHOOL HERE. YES WE CAN OR WE CANNOT BUILD A PRESCHOOL OR WEEK. BUILD A PRESCHOOL BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF REMEDIATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT SO THE CENTURY SAYS AND CAN GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS THANK YOU. DO YOU RESPOND TO THE PREVIOUS GENTLEMAN'S -- CONCERNS AND THE ISSUE OF MAXIMIZING THE VALUE YEAH I THINK THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT WENT UP I KNOW IT CAME UP THE LAST HEARING AND WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS IT -- COUPLE THINGS ONE I KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR YOU DOES NOT INCLUDE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT POINT THIS IS JUST A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ASKED TO START THIS WORK. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS APPROVED LAST WEEK BY THIS COMMITTEE. INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT TALK ABOUT MAXIMIZING VALUE IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS WERE WORK OR CARE OR AND THAT. THERE WAS -- A CLEAR FOCUS ON THE INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE TO FOCUS ON THE LONG. SO BOTH OF THOSE PIECES WERE IN THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS MISTER NOT BROUGHT UP BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. IS POINTS REPAIR IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS LONG TERM WITH WITH ANY REVENUE THAT WOULD BE GENERATED FROM A PROCEEDS OF SAILOR DITION. THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IN YOUR PERFUME TO DECIDE BECAUSE IT WOULD ALL BE GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES THE GENERAL FUND LEGISLATURE. OKAY. THAT. MEANS THERE'S THE WHAT WE DO WITH RIGHT OR THE IDEA OF THE SUGGEST. TO MAXIMIZE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE AND THIS IS THE NUMBER. SO FROM A PURELY PROCESS STANDPOINT WERE IS THE YEAH RIGHT WHERE IT STEP ONE WHERE WHAT WE PRESENTED TO YOU LAST WEEK WAS A RESULT STEPS LIKE -- ONE SO THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WILL BE SPEAKING WITH YOU ON THIS TOPIC IT IS THE FIRST TIME IT WILL BE THE LAST SUMMER SPEAKING WITH YOU ON THIS TOPIC WILL BE [inaudible] ANYTHING.

I AM BOUND CRAWFORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. AND I'VE RIGHT -- KRISTIN MARK ON TO WHO IS ON MY AT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AND IONIC COULD VERY WHO IS MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR. AND YOU'VE ALL BEEN HANDED PACKETS THAT -- AYE ANIMALS. BRIEFLY GO OVER WITH YOU. IN A FEW MINUTES. AM. GOOD AFTERNOON. THERE WERE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO PRESENT CON CURRENTLY BEING HERE AND THE ASSEMBLY SO. I'M GONNA JUST READ THIS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES AND WE WANTED TO BE CONSISTENT. AM IN OUR TESTIMONY. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S REVISIONS TO OUR BUDGET. TOM THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS PRIMARILY A GRANT MAKING AGENCY WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR PROGRAMS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AM ACCESSIBILITY STATEWIDE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE FOLLOWING STAFF WORK -- TARGETED REGIONAL OUTREACH WORKSHOPS COMMUNITY MEETINGS WEBINARS M. MONITORING. YEAH THE GRANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WE USE AT THAT CONTINUAL EVALUATION THAT WE DO WITH OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE FIELD A CANELA JUDY. COUNCIL APPROVAL PROCESS. SEE A C. IS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL POSITION AUTHORITY R SIX POINT THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT. DISTRIBUTION OF OUR LOCAL AS AN EXPENSE. WE ARE GRANTING PROGRAMS. SINCE HE AGENCIES DEVASTATING CUTS OVER A DECADE AGO SEE A C. AS BEEN FUNCTIONING ADDED DEFICIT IN HUMAN RESOURCES. PRESENTLY THE CHC HAS BEEN OPERATING WITH A STAFF OF TWENTY THREE POINT. FIVE FTE POSITIONS ADMINISTERING LOCAL ASSISTANCE TOTALING FIFTEEN POINT NINE MILLION AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL ON GOING TEN MILLION THE CA SEE BUDGET. IN THE FISCAL YEAR 200-019-2000 TWENTY THIS AUGMENTS. EQUATES TO A 60% INCREASE. IN OUR GRANTING FUNCTIONS WITH LOCAL ASSISTANT. AT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL POSITION OF AUTHORITY IS C. A. C. WILL HAVE ONLY TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE POSITIONS TO IT MESSED MINISTER THE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND STAFFING IN 200-012-0002. WHEN LOCAL ASSISTANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX MILLION WITH FORTY FOUR POINT SEVEN F. T.? ALMOST DOUBLE THOSE POSITIONS. WE HAVE A EVERY. WORKFORCE AND ALICE'S. AM. AGENCIES BUDGET HAS INCREMENTALLY INCREASED FROM. ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN POINT. NINE NINE IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE TOWARDS SERVING. GEOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN OUR STATE. SEE A C. NOW ADMINISTERS EIGHTEEN GRANT PROGRAMS. SERVING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED ARTS ORGANIZATION. THESE EIGHT HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND ARTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE EIGHT ALMOST. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY THREE GRANTS WERE ADMINISTERED THIS YEAR WITH CURRENT STAFF ALREADY OVER CAPACITY. AND NEED TO PASS ON EXCESS REDUCED TO COMPLETE THE KEY FUNCTIONS NECESSARY IN THE GRANT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND PROVIDE THE OUT REACH. IT'S EXPECTED OF A STATE ARTS AGENCY. THE AGENCY HAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF APPROVED PHYSICIANS AND AN INCREASED BUDGETARY AUTHORITY. WHICH IS RESULT IN AN INCREASE TECHNICAL ANALYTICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE AGENCY'S PROGRAM. WE'VE PROVIDED YOU WITH PACKETS OF INFORMATION. AT THE MY DEPUTY IS GOING TO GO OVER WITH YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SO YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A FEW SLIDES FROM. OUR SIDE. AND I WANT TO JUST EXPLAIN TO YOU -- THE GOVERNOR MAY REVISE REVISION INCLUDED AN INITIAL AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION THE FINANCE LETTER INDICATES. AT C. C. WILL DISTRIBUTE FIVE MILLION TO THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM. FIVE MILLION TO THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE WHOLE. 5% PROVISION IS RESTRICTED TO THE TEN MILLION THAT WAS IN OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT WHICH YOU SEE HERE IS OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE PERSONS ARE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS JUST TO TRY TO INTEGRATE TO YOU. THE DIFFERENCE WITH OUR GROWTH THE YELLOW. OUR IS OUR BUDGET INCREASES AND AT THE BOTTOM M. IS THE STAFF BEING BASED VERY INCREMENTAL TO THE NUMBER TO THE AMOUNT OF BUDGET SEARCH THE FLAT LINE. WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MAJOR INCREASES IN OUR BUDGET THIS DOES INCLUDE THOSE -- ONE TIME FUNDS AS WELL AS PERMANENT FUNDING OVER THE YEARS. THAT'S WHAT THAT FIRST SLIDE SHOWS IF YOU TURN IT OVER. WE HAVE A WORK. LOAD MEASURES OVER FISCAL YEAR. SO YOU'LL SEE THAT ACROSS TIME HERE ARE SOME MAJOR KEY FUNCTIONS OF OUR AGENCY WE DO GRANT PROGRAMS. OR THE BLUE IS THE NUMBER OF GRANT. PROGRAMS THAT -- WE THAT WE ARE MANAGING THE ORANGE IS THE GRANT APPLICATIONS RECEIVED. THEY RAISE THE GRANT APPLICATIONS APPROVED IT WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE UNDER CONTRACT -- WE HAVE PANELS. AN OLD LINE THAT THROUGHOUT ALL OF OURS. I'M NUMBER OF PANELISTS SO WE HAVE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PANELISTS THAT WE WORK WITH. ARE JUST ORDERS PROCESSES THE GREEN AND DOCTORS PROCESSES A LARGE BLUE. AND YOU'LL SEE OVER IME THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN THE WORK TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WORK LOAD. BUT IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE DIFFERENT BARS. THE BLUE BAR REPRESENTS ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS WORKING ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS ALL OF THOSE -- AT GRANT PROGRAMS AND THEN THE GREEN BAR REPRESENTS A PART TIME PERSON IN THE GRAY IN THE YELLOW IS ACTUALLY ONE PERSON MANAGING ALL OF THAT. INCREASE OVER TIME. SO MY HOPE THAT THIS. KIND OF ROUNDED AND GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT INTO THE WORK. RIGHT NOW MY WE NEED. TO IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN PUT IT HERE THERE IS A TEST CASE OF BREACH OF POSITIONS THAT WE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL THIS TIME THE WE ARE I THINK STILL WAITING ON THE DETAILS FROM THE EAST I KNOW. REMAINING IN A FINANCE. WELL HERE I MANY YEARS THIS ARTISTIC STATE [inaudible] COUNSEL. HAD ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT CLEARLY KEPT. THE DOORS OF WHATEVER THEY WERE ABLE TO GRANT. PROVIDE. WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH A CHECK OFF. SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PICK UP THE GRANT. AND THEY DID A LICENSE PLATE. WELL THEY WERE VALUE TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE. AND THEN WE RESURRECTED. AND THIS WILL CONTINUE THE ASCENT I WOULDN'T MOVE THE OKAY. SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE AS REQUEST COMMENT. YES MADAM. CHAIR AND MEMBERS DAVID JONES OF HAVE THE CITY OF GLENDALE OBVIOUSLY VERY STRONG IN SUPPORT OF THE ARMENIAN MUSEUM. STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE ARTS COUNCIL IT'S BEEN DECIMATED OVER THE YEARS. SO WE'RE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SUPPORTING ARTS AND SPECIFICALLY THE ARMY MUSEUM WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT CITIZENS BLUNDELL THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND RUNOFF THANK YOU HI MY NAME'S JULIE BECKER AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALFORNIA ARTS ADVOCATES -- WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR INCREASED UNDING FOR THE ARTS IN THE CREATIVE SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOVE TO SEE THE INCREASE CONTINUE TO BUILD TO THE ARTS COUNCIL CAN SERVE AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO GRANTS IN SUPPORT OF THE ARTS AND CREATIVE CONNIE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT OPPOSE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S LINE ITEMS FOR THE HOLOCAUST AND ARMENIAN MUSEUMS AND ARE IN SUPPORT OF ALL FUNDING THAT GOES TOWARDS THE ARTS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION GOING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCILS BUDGET. CSE DOES NOT FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY BUT IT IS ACTUALLY FOR BITTEN UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION THIS PROPOSED PASSED THROUGH ALLOCATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CA SEES MISSION CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS THE GRANT MAKING ARM OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEIR MODEL IS TO PROVIDE FOR A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT IT HERE'S TO THE HIGHESTSTANDARDS. THE C. A. C. FUNDS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AT LEVELS. DISSIPATED BY THESE TWO LARGE APPROPRIATIONS. WE RESERVE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THIS FUNDING WILL BE MORE PROPERLY PASSED THROUGH TO THESE MUSEUMS FREE OF THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM GRANT PROGRAM CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN STATE SIGN AB. FORTY TWO CALIFORNIA MUSEUM GRANT PROGRAM IS AN OBJECTIVELY BETTER MECHANISM FOR EXECUTING THIS. SHOULD THE SHOULD THE LEGISLATIVE VOTE TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I DO I DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THAT I THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S GREAT TO BE GIVING FUNDING TO THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM. I THINK THAT'S A VERY AND ALSO THE MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED I MEAN I'M I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN MUSEUM BECAUSE AS A LIGHT. A NUMBER OF OUR ARMENIANS NOT ONLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT IN IN THE IN THE BROADER LA COUNTY AREA SO [inaudible] IS [inaudible] ONE AND FORCE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] OKAY. ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER. NINE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS. YES -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BETH MISSIONS BEING EMPTY FOR VETERANS HOME OPERATIONS FOR CALVET. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THIS WITH TO YOU AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF YOU ALIGNING THE MILITARY VETERANS COPE WITH CALVET. WITH CALVET BUDGET STRUCTURE -- AS YOU MAY RECALL THIS ISSUE CAME UP DURING THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IS AUDIT OF CALVET LEASES AT CERTAIN VETERANS HOMES. ON THE AUDITOR REFERENCE. THE IN ITS IN THEIR FINAL REPORT A SECTION OF CODE OF MILITARY VETERANS CODE THAT DATED CAL THAT SHOULD BE RETAINING AN AUGMENTING. HOMES BUDGETS WITH REVENUES THAT ARE COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- OR ACTUALLY IT WAS THAT IT WASN'T SO MUCH THAT WE SHOULD BE WAS THAT THE LANGUAGE INDICATED THAT THE MILITARY VETERANS CODE LANGUAGE -- SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE. AND THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN RETAINING WHAT WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING. IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN RETAINING IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR BUDGET STRUCTURE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT A DECADE AGO -- THAT STRUCTURE PROVIDES CALVET FULL FUNDING OF THE GENERAL FUND AT THE START OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR OUR ONGOING REGULAR OPERATIONS. AND THEN SO THAT WE CAN OPERATE AS AROUND THE CLOCK HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION AND THEN THAT THEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE COLLECT REVENUES. FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES AND RETURN THAT BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. TO OFFSET WHAT WE WERE PROVIDED ON THE FRONT -- THE AUDITOR INDICATED IN THEIR FINAL REPORT THAT THE STATE SHOULD IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ONLINE TO CODE WITH. AND THESE CHANGES SIR TO DO THAT. BECAUSE THE FUNDING STRUCTURE I DESCRIBED IT WAS ESTABLISHED FORMALLY TO THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS -- RETAINING THE FUNDS TO AUGMENT OUR HOMES BUDGETS WOULD. BE A CALL WOULD BE A PRACTICE THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THAT -- IT BY WHAT WE BELIEVE THE INTENT WAS AT THE TIME THAT THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. SO THEREFORE INSTEAD WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. ALEXA CORRECT THE OUTDATED COACH CODE LANGUAGE TO BRING THE TWO INTO ALIGNMENT -- IT'S SORT OF AN OVERVIEW FOR YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT. ANIMAL YOU KNOW CONCERNS. YES. AND I AM -- CONVEYED TO CALVET IT'S QUESTIONS BETWEEN THE TAP PROGRAM. NOW THE FOR THOSE TO SOMEBODY ELSE FROM CALVET BUT I AM INTERESTED TO PASS ALONG I WILL BE HAPPY TO TRANSITION. OKAY THIS IS PROGRAM -- I MOVE THE MEASURE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] PUBLIC [inaudible] COMMENT [inaudible] NO. OKAY SEE. NINE WE HAVE LOCAL. ENERGY BROTHER I ENERGY NIELSEN. SENATOR ALBERT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE DON'T HAVE [inaudible] TO SOMEONE. OKAY -- ITEM TEN SECRETARY OF STATE VOTING SYSTEMS REPLACEMENT FOR COUNTIES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF SUSAN LAPSLEY W. SECTORS STATE. SURGERIES STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M WE ARE PROPOSING EIGHTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO COVER THE COST REPLACEMENT OF VOTING SYSTEMS WHICH INCLUDES. TABULATION EQUIPMENT ACCESSIBLE. APPOINTMENTS ELECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SOFTWARE HARDWARE -- ELECTRONIC BOOKS AND ON DEMAND -- PRINTERS. AS YOU MAY RECALL WE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT LAST YEAR AND IT MADE A REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF OWNING SYSTEM SAY. THAT TIME WE DISCUSSED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS OR WE WERE AS FAR AS THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THE DESPERATE NEED. FOR IMPROVEMENT AND UPGRADE OF THOSE VOTING SYSTEMS AND AT THE TIME. YOU'LL ALL GENEROUSLY APPROPRIATED HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IT HAD A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH ATTACHED TO IT THIS IS TO SUPPLEMENT THAT REQUEST AND TO MODIFY THE B. AND MATCH FROM A FIFTY FIFTY REQUEST TO A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOT FROM COUNTIES WAS THAT THE FIFTY FIFTY MATCH ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMALL COUNTY. AS WAS AND DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND NOT IN LINE WITH PAST PRACTICES FOR FUNDING BOTH THE FEDERAL FUNDING AND THE STATE BUILDING MODERNIZATION BOARD FUNDING. WERE ADDISON A FIVE TWENTY FIVE MATCH THIS REQUEST BRINGS. THIS FUNDING THAT AND IT AUGMENTS IT TO BRING IN LINE WITH THAT. MATCHING CRITERIA. I AM OPEN TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS. SO WE JUST NOTED AS WAS ALREADY SEATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR PROVIDED A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. NONE OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE YET BEEN RECEIVED BY THE CHINESE THE SECRETARY OF STATE NOTE SO THERE'S A PRETTY. I INVOLVED PROCESS -- THAT GOES INTO. THE COUNTY IS. MOVING THE FUNDING RECEIVING THE GRANTS AND SO FORTH SO WE JUST -- POSED A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THAT WE ARE RELATED TO STOP. OVER THE WEEKEND INCLUDING -- WHAT DELAYS OF ANY THERE MIGHT BE IN GETTING THESE FUNDS INTO COUNTIES AND WHETHER OR NOT CHINESE WOULD -- REALISTICALLY BE ABLE TO USE THE SPONSOR FOR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. ON AND ONE SORT OF THAT PICTURE BECAME CLEAR. ARE HOW MIGHT THESE FUNDS BE BEST UTILIZED TO SHORE UP ELECTIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION GIVEN. THE PROCESSING DELAYS IN GETTING THESE BONDS. PLEASE RESPOND I WOULD BE HAPPY. TO I AM THE PROCESS WITH APPROPRIATION -- THERE WERE DELAYS AND THAT WAS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OUR AGENCY WAS GOING TO THE PROCESS OF DISCOUNT AND IMITATION WHICH HAS -- BROUGHT AND A SLOWDOWN TO EVERY ASPECT OF ALL OF OUR OFFICE IN -- GENERATING CONTRACTS IMPLEMENTING CONTRACTS SAID THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF IT. THESE A REIMBURSEMENT BASED CONTRACTS SO THEY BE THE COUNTIES GET CONTRACTS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR BOARD PROCESS AND THEN THE IMPACT BUT SO. FOR US TO GET HIM OUT THE DOOR WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF OUR FISCAL IMPLEMENTATION. THEN ONCE WE GET INTO THE COUNTY IS THE COUNTIES THEN HAVE TO GO TO THEIR BOARDS AND GET THEIR APPROVAL AND AND GO THROUGH THEIR MACHEN ASIANS AND THEN THEY SEND IT BACK TO US. SO WE DO HAVE I BELIEVE -- FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT M. CONTRACTS RETURNS. WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING REQUESTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIS COUNTY IS AN REQUEST THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN APPROVED BY OFFICE OUR OFFICE. THOSE THEN GO TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHICH THEN HAS THEIR OWN PROCESS FOR ACTUALLY USING THOSE. AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING LOTS OF REQUESTS FROM COUNTERED AT QUESTIONS FROM COUNTIES ABOUT. HOW THE REQUESTED? THEY'VE BEEN VOICING THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THE FIFTY FIFTY MATCH IN THERE. THE RETICENCE ON SOME OTHER BOARDS TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH MONEY SO I THINK. THIS ALLOCATION AND THE CHANGE OF THE MATCH FOR A FIFTY FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WILL REALLY SPEED UP. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE THE OR CERTAIN COUNTIES. WHOSE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS FINANCIAL. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXPLAIN -- YOU WILL SPEED UP WITH THE COUNTY THROUGH DIDN'T HAVE FINANCIAL ISSUE AS FAR AS BEING ABLE. TO MAP. OR FISCAL ALL THAT THE SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF THIS GAL. WELL THE NON. THE COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCING TO BE ABLE TO DO. THE MEADOW THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN THIS SO THERE'S THAT IT BY TAKING UP A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH TO A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE MATCH IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF THAT THEY HAVE TO COME UP. AS A MATTER. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER PROVISION IN THIS THAT FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE FIFTY OR FEWER PRECINCTS. THERE'S NO MATCH SO THAT I THINK GOES A LONG WAYS FOR THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES THAT REALLY ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN COMING UP WITH ANY ANY MATCH. I'M AS I SAID OUR GOOD WE DO HAVE CONTRACTS BACK FOR FIFTY OF THEM -- AND HAVING THOSE IN PLACE NOW MAKES THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. AND MUCH. NOW IS IT CAN BE DONE MORE EXPEDITED. FIFTY EIGHT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. YOU HAVE A CONTRACT. IT JUST HAPPENED NOW REQUESTED REIMBURSEMENTS. WE HAVE THEIR CONTRACTORS IN DID IT WITHOUT. ON THE BASIS OF THE MATCH IT NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY WRAPPED. SO WHY DO YOU NEED. SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE YEAH [inaudible] ALREADY AGREED. ITS IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT THE FIFTY FIFTY IN ALLOCATION THE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR WAS IN A SUFFICIENT MATH IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THEM. AND WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR THE WHOLE ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE THE VOTING SYSTEMS OF TELL TABULATION ELECTRONIC BOOKS ABOUT ON IT. SO THIS MAKES A CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS REQUEST -- FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF AT A 7525% MATCH THE WE LIKE I SAID WE DID HEAR MANY COMPLAINTS FROM COUNTY IS THAT. GOSH THIS FIFTY FIFTY MATCH WASN'T ENOUGH AND IT WITH ITS WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO -- THEY NOT THEY ENTERED INTO IT BUT KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT BUT THEY THINK THAT THEY HAD ADVOCATED BOTH TO THEIR MORE SUPERVISORS TO OUR OFFICE AND OTHERS THAT JUST TO GET THE V. M.. MATCH CHANGED IN IT AND INCREASED BE THAT THE FUNDING AMOUNT TO BE SPENT WITH. AGAIN WHAT THE WAY WITH AN AXE. IT IF I MAY I MEAN I I THINK SORT OF THE QUESTION HERE LEGISLATURE IS IS A POLICY CHOICE BUT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSE TO GIVEN THAT MOST COUNTIES OF ALREADY OPTED TO OPERATOR IN THE PROCESS OF UPGRADING THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS DO THEY WANT TO INCREASE THE SUBSIDY TO WHAT. I HAVE. ON OUT. THERE IS A STATE RATIONALE IN TERMS OF AN INTEREST IN TERMS OF TO KERN IT'S A LITTLE ACTION SO IT'S NOT NOT. INCONSISTENT FOR THE STATE TO DO SO -- BUT IF IT DOES. THE IT DOES NOT IT AT AT AT LEAST THE INFORMATION WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR AND IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE DAYS IN OUR HANDS -- SEEM THAT IT'S NECESSARILY GOING TO IMPORT A LOT OF ANI'S CHOICES THAN WHAT THEY DO FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTION. AND I'M SORRY I WILL DISAGREE WITH THAT -- I THINK THAT IT IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING [inaudible] IT. ALLOWS THEM TO DO MORE IN ANTICIPATION OF TWENTY TWENTY I THINK. THE MAJORITY OF THEM ALREADY AS SO. WE'VE THE SECRETARY HAD INITIATED THE PROCESS TO DECERTIFY VOTING SYSTEMS THAT AREN'T. TESTED AND CERTIFIED TO OUR LATEST STANDARDS. AND WE BEGAN THAT PROCESS IN FEBRUARY AND OF ALL THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN MOVING FORWARD KNOWING THAT THAT GOES INTO A FACT AND IN ANTICIPATION OF THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION SO. LEADING UP TO THAT MANY OF THE COUNTIES WERE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY TO GETTING NEW VOTING SYSTEMS. THIS MONEY GOES TO OF LARGER. PIECE OF THE ELECTION PIES SO WE HAVE. WE HAVE OUTDATED INFRASTRUCTURE THE THEY CAN NOW PURCHASE -- OUT BALLOT ON MAN PRINTERS THEY CAN NOW PURCHASE -- ELECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT CAN NOW PRINT AND PURCHASE. VOTER VOTE TABULATION THEY CAN VOTE IT'S IT'S MORE THAN JUST THOSE VOTING SYSTEM SO I THINK WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SHORE UP. MORE THAN THEY HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD DO IN ADVANCE OF TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THAT. THE MATCH. IT WAS A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH THAT'S A BIG CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THEM SO INSTEAD OF BUYING. YOU KNOW A FULL PIE THEY BOUGHT HALF OF HI WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THEY CAN BY THREE QUARTERS OF A HIGH. AND SHORT THEMSELVES UP IN AND BE BETTER PREPARED. FOR TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA IN JEOPARDY OF HAVING THE CERTIFIED. VOTING APPARATUS BUT TWENTY MARCH [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY. SO. AS WE HAVE THIS PART OF THE DECERTIFICATION -- WE A AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES THAT GO INTO PROCURING A VOTING SYSTEM AND AND THE NATURAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS. WE ALOUD'S COUNTIES TO REQUEST TO OUR OFFICE A CONDITIONAL USE OF IT OUR EXTENDED. CONDITIONAL USE -- APPROVAL SO OF THAT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RECEIVES -- THIRTEEN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THIRTY THANK YOU THIRTEEN REQUEST FOR EXTENSION. OF THOSE NINE WERE -- SORT OF BACK UP STAYS SAID. YOU KNOW SURGERY STATE WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SAND WHERE WE'VE START THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH GETTING A NEW VOTING SYSTEM -- BUT WE WANT TO PUT THIS IN JUST IN CASE BECAUSE SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN. IT'S ARE RESPONSIVE THAT THERE'S WIND UP NOT GETTING AN UP -- IT INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES RESPONDING THAT KIND OF THING SO WE'RE GONNA BUT THE SENSE YOU. TO AND JUST AS A PLACEHOLDER. THE REMAINING FOUR TWO OF THEM HAVE PLANS TO IMPLEMENT IN A PHASED APPROACH SO THEY A.. M. WOULD DO PART OF THE NEW VOTING SYSTEM IN THE PRIMARY BECAUSE AGAIN THE MEMORIES BEEN MOVED UP TO MARCH. SO THAT THAT SORT OF THE TIME FRAME FOR COUNTIES IN PREPARATION. AND THEN THEY'LL DO A FULL IMPLEMENTATION THEIR NEW SYSTEM IN -- NOVEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY THE OTHER TWO WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR THEIR MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT A WERE WORKING AT IDENTIFYING REALLY WHAT THEIR SPECIFIC PLANS ARE REMOVING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT AND WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AT LEAST TWO COUNTIES IT MAY NOT HAVE. CERTIFIED OR APPROVED OR ONE OF THE TERM MAY BE. VOTING SYSTEMS FROM MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT ACCURATE. THEY WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY WORST CASE NUYS TO OF THAT -- HAVEN'T TAKEN THE STEPS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WITH A THAT CERTIFIED IN TO THE NEW VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS. IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION CORRECT YES AND WHAT TO COUNTIES OF THE CAN I GET BACK CENTER IN ALL OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BIG DEAL. SO YES LET US KNOW THAT YES I WILL ALL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. IT IS THIS ENOUGH TIME JUST AS WELL AS IT IS IT ENOUGH TIME FOR THOSE TWO COUNTIES TO GET THERE. I THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW THERE'S ANY OTHER CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTATION NO IT'S NOT LOS ANGELES IS IT HAS BEEN MOVING FOR WITH THEIR OPEN SOURCE VOTING SYSTEM. I'M IN THERE ON THE ON THE PATH THAT TO THEIR ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAD SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR EXTENSION USE AS A BACKUP. I'M.
