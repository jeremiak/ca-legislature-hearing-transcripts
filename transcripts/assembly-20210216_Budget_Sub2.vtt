IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THIS

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.210
QUESTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.512
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

FOR DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.788
THAT SCALE AND WE DON'T KNOW

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:11.123
HOW MANY STUDENTS HERE IN

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.025
CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.194
SCHOOL BY GRADE FOR SOCCER

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.562
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.930
EXPERIENCE AND STUDENT LEARNING

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.265
ALWAYS COMES FROM A SUBSET

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.499
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FROM

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.535
OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA BUT USING

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.836
THIS INFORMATION WE CAN PAINT

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.104
A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE OF THE

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.805
IMPACT OF CORPORATE NINETEEN ON

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.140
STUDENTS IN THE ELEVEN MONTHS

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.742
AND SCHOOLS AND ACTUALLY CLOSED

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.710
IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY SO I'M

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:32.678
GOING TO START WITH WHAT WE

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.513
KNOW ABOUT COPING IMPACT ON

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.115
STUDENT LEARNING SINCE THE

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.217
PANDEMIC STARTED RESEARCHERS

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.451
HAVE WORKED TO PROTECT

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:40.819
FIRST AND THEN TEST MAKE

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.988
IMPACT EXTENDED EDUCATIONAL

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.056
DISRUPTIONS ON STUDENT

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.824
LEARNING NATIONAL STUDIES

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.359
HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:48.894
THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.796
SIGNIFICANT SETBACKS IN ENGLISH

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.898
LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH RESULTS

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.099
VERY QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.368
DEPENDING ON THE SAMPLE A LARGE

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.736
PART THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:13:57.803 --> 00:14:01.407
VERY DIFFERENT -- RELATIONS

00:14:01.473 --> 00:14:03.309
ACROSS STATE BUT ALSO DIFFERENT

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.743
CONTEXTS -- HOW STUDENTS

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.812
ARE BEING EDUCATED HOW MANY

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.881
STUDENTS WERE OUT OF SCHOOL

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:10.749
IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.718
AND IN THROUGH THE SUMMER

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:13.786
NOW THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:14.920
VARIATION WITH MANY U.

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:15.521
S.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.122
SCHOOLS IN PERSON WHILE THE

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.457
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.725
STUDENTS ARE STILL IN THE

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.560
LEARNING SO FOR THIS REASON

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:22.528
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.096
THE IMPACT OF ENDEMIC FOR

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:26.198
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SKEPTICALLY

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:28.334
SO CASE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.002
AT EDUCATION ANALYTICS AND

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.470
THE CORE DISTRICTS UTILIZED

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.905
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA IN

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.341

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.312
AND EIGHTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.247
THAT ARE PART OF THE CORE

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.015
DATA COLLABORATIVE THE FULL

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:44.617

FOR THE HEARING IN OUR STUDY

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.296
LIKE OTHERS OF ITS KIND WE

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.697
COMPARE LEARNING RATES DURING

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.666
THE PANDEMIC TO LEARNING RATE

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.936
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE OBSERVED

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.070
DURING THE PANDEMIC OR WHAT WE

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:07.439
CALL LEARNING LOSSES AND THE

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.674
SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WE

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.209
WOULD HOPE STUDENTS TO WHEN

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.111
A CUMULATE IN ANY GIVEN TIME

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:14.146
THAT THEY DIDN'T ACCUMULATE AS

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.448
A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC THE

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:17.716
FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS WE USE

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.184
OUR MAP AND STARKEL COMPLETE

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.854
YOUR STANDARDS BASED AND DOCTOR

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.821
AND THEY WERE ADMINISTERED

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.890
BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER IN

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.125
ALICE THIS THAT I'M GOING TO

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.993
TALK ABOUT TODAY FIFTH BOTTOM

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.362
HAS MEASURING COPE WITH IMPACT

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.031
AT THE TIME THAT SCHOOL STARTED

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.067
ALL OVERALL WE FIND THAT THERE

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.468
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT LEARNING

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.037
LOSS IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.738
ARTS AND MATH WITH STUDENTS

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.006
IN GRADES FOUR THROUGH SIX

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.108
THE MOST IMPACTED ESTIMATES

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.843
VARY BY GRADE AND ASSESSMENT

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.312
BUT OUR ANALYSES SHOW THAT

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:47.713
STUDENTS NEEDS GREATER BEHIND

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.381
FIVE BETWEEN FIVE AND TWENTY

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.816
FIVE PERCENT BEHIND WHERE THEY

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.319
WOULD BE IN A TYPICAL YEAR

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.354
AVERAGES MASK VERY SERIOUS

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:56.689
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENT

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.891
GROUPS LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.693
MOST RATES FOR BOTH ENGLISH

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.628
LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH AND

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.196
ACROSS BOTH ASSESSMENT PROCESS

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.230
SCHEDULING MORE LEARNING

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.299
TENDED HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.701
IN SOME GRADES LOWER INCOME

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.469
STUDENTS LOST LEARNING WHILE

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.004
HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS LEARNING

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.273
ACTUALLY ACCELERATED AND FOR

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.741
STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH AND

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.609
NEARLY EVERY GRADE AND YEAH

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:18.844
IN THIS LANGUAGE ARTS AND

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.546
EARLY GRADES FOR MATH ACROSS

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.281
BOTH ASSESSMENTS THERE WAS

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:23.882
SUBSTANTIAL LEARNING LOSS

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:25.584
STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.720
LOSING THIRTY PERCENT IN GRADE

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:30.689
FIVE OF A TYPICAL YEAR WELL

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.424
OTHER STUDENTS ONLY LOST ABOUT

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.693
TEN PERCENT SO THIS IS BOTH

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.295
SHOWING THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.996
BEING AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.798
THAT SOME STUDENTS ARE BEING

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.201
AFFECTED MUCH MORE AND THIS IS

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.769
ON TOP OF WHAT WE'RE ALREADY

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.105
VERY PERSISTENT AND PERVASIVE

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.173
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BETWEEN GROUPS

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.675
THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.410
THAT THERE'S BEEN A FANNING OUT

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:53.412
OF IT SHE MADE GAPS AS A RESULT

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.514
THE PANDEMIC WITH SOME STUDENTS

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.516
FALLING VERY QUICKLY BEHIND

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:59.451
OTHER STUDENTS STAYING ON TRACK

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.220
OR FALLING BEHIND AT A LOWER

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.689
RATE BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.157
BE CLEAR ABOUT WHY WE'RE SEEING

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.959
THESE GAPS EMERGED DISTANCE

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:08.460
LEARNING REQUIRES A STABLE

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.229
HOME ENVIRONMENT HOUSING AND

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:12.731
FOOD SECURITY RELIABLE ACCESS

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.433
TO WIFI AND COMPUTERS AND AN

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.069
ADULT AT HOME TO SUPERVISE IN

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:18.604
THE EARLY GRADES WHEN STUDENTS

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.705
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FOLLOW

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.440
DIRECTIONS OR NAVIGATE ONLINE

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.575
ASSIGNMENT FOR MANY STUDENTS

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.877
IN THE UPPER GRADES TWO DON'T

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:26.111
HAVE STRONG SELF MANAGEMENT

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.746
SKILLS OR WHO NEED SUPPORT TO

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:30.149
STAY ON TASK AND LEARNING THIS

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.184
IS CREATING A LARGE DISCREPANCY

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.253
BETWEEN HER LEGS STUDENTS

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.155
WHOSE FAMILIES CAN HIRE A FULL

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.890
TIME TUTOR OR EVEN A POTENTIAL

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.558
TEACHER WHO HAVE A PARENT AT

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.693
HOME FULL TIME AND OTHERS WHO

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.995
MAY NOT HAVE AN ADULT AT HOME

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:45.130
AT ALL OR ANY ADULT WHO DOESN'T

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:46.999
SPEAK ENGLISH OR DOES NOT HAVE

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:48.634
THE EDUCATION OR TRAINING TO

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.802
BE ABLE TO THE COURT LEARNING

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.870
OR TECHNOLOGY YEARS I MEAN

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.238
WE HAVE TO OF COURSE ACTIVE

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:54.840
TO THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.309
THE VIRUS ITSELF WE KNOW THAT

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.911
THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.746
ON BOTH HEALTH AND ECONOMICS

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:01.980
HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY CERTAIN

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.449
COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:05.651
BLACK AND LYFT NEXT COMMUNITIES

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.186
WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.321
CARE INCOME INEQUALITY AND

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:10.689
DISPROPORTIONATE EMPLOYMENT IN

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:14.226
HIGH RISK POSITIONS IT ALSO IS

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.994
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE THAT

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:17.863
STUDENTS CANNOT ACCESS LEARNING

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.065
THEIR BASIC NEEDS ARE MET AND

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.034
WE KNOW THAT SOME STUDENTS MAY

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.869
ALSO BE FACING OF LAPTOP USE OR

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.038
EVEN A COLLECTED HIGH WITHOUT

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:28.106
SCHOOLS TO STEP IN AND HELP

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:29.775
WITH THOSE NEEDS RIGHT MAYBE

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.211
THEY DID BEFORE WE ALSO KNOW

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.545
THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC ISSUES

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.813
FOR STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.049
AND THEY JUST ARE NOT LEARNING

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:38.750
ENGLISH REQUIRES OPPORTUNITIES

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:39.885
FOR STUDENTS TO TALK WITH

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.020
EACH OTHER AND WITH CLASSMATES

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.288
WITHOUT THIS INTERACTION IT'S

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.556
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEARN

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.291
THE LANGUAGE AND WITHOUT THE

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.060
KIND OF SUPPORT FOR ACCESSING

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:50.529
GRADE LEVEL CONTENT IN ENGLISH

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:51.897
WILL BE VERY HARD FOR THEM TO

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.899
STAY ON GRADE LEVEL ESPECIALLY

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.034
GIVEN THAT BY DEFINITION THERE

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.369
AND HOME WORKING WHICH IS NOT

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.038
SPOKEN AND SO THE ADULT THERE

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.139
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP WITH

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.542
CONTENT STILL RELEASED FINDINGS

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.010
FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.879
WHO SIMILARLY FACE YOU NEED

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.114
TO BUT SIMILAR CHALLENGES HAVE

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.682
INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS WHICH

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.184
DETAIL THE KIND OF SPECIALIZED

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.353
SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED AND

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.255
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT PARENTS WILL

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.789
HAVE THE TYPES OF SKILLS AND

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.224
TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:21.593
THOSE SERVICES A RECENT SURVEY

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.028
SHOWED THAT THIRTY NINE PERCENT

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.429
OF PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:25.831
THESE INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.798
RECORDED THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:29.434
RECEIVING ANY SUPPORT AT ALL

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.969
IN OUR ANALYSIS WE ALREADY

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.304
KNOW THAT A LARGE PROPORTION

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.672
OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.407
WERE MISSING AND ALMOST NOT

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:38.477
MUCH RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT --

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.912
WHO IS BEING ASSESSED AND WHAT

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:41.213
THAT MEANS ABOUT THESE KINDS

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.649
OF LEARNING LAS ASSESSMENTS ARE

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:45.050
GENERALLY THIS ISSUE OF MISSING

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.885
STUDENTS IS A HUGE CONCERN

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:47.853
BECAUSE WE'RE COMPLETELY

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.921
BLIND TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:50.589
WITH THEM I DON'T KNOW IF

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:52.090
MAKING DISENGAGEMENT SCHOOL

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.659
AND HIGHER EARLY IF THEY MOVED

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:55.260
AWAY IF THEY'RE IN A CHARTER

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:56.795
SCHOOL PROGRAM HOME SCHOOL

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.097
PROGRAM OR PRIVATE SCHOOL OR IF

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.166
THEY'RE OKAY AT ALL IF THEY'RE

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:02.434
MISSING FROM THE ASSESSMENTS

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.069
BECAUSE THEY'RE DISENGAGED FROM

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:06.104
SCHOOL ALTOGETHER THE OVERALL

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.539
IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.341
IS MUCH MORE DIRE THAN OUR

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.977
ANALYSIS SHOWS IN ALMOST EVERY

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.378
ANALYSIS OF LEARNING THAT

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:14.513
I'VE SEEN THERE'S TYPICALLY

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.214
BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY FIVE

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.382
PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:19.451
MISSING ACT THOSE STUDENTS

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.520
ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY KIND

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.488
OF INSTRUCTION ON MUCH BIGGER

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.190
PROBLEM THAN ANY ANALYSIS HAS

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.292
SHOWN US FAR AND WE KNOW THAT

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.361
ENROLLMENT OVERALL IS DOWN

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.330
PREVIOUS ANALYSIS BY CD EASTER

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:32.831
JUST THAT STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:33.966
IS DOWN A HUNDRED THIRTY

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:35.801
THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ALICE'S

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:36.835
FROM SOME OF OUR STATE'S

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.337
LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOWS

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.972
THAT KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:42.641
IS DOWN NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.775
INCREASE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:46.011
DOWN TO THERE'S MORE REASON

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.245
TO BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:49.414
EARLY GRADES I THINK STUDENTS

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.283
RE ENROLL IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.151
ONE DUSTER KINDERGARTEN AND

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.721
FIRST GRADE VERY FAR BEHIND

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.089
AND EVEN FOR THE STUDENTS

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:58.357
THAT ARE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.725
DISTANCE LEARNING IS GENERALLY

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:00.826
HARDEST FOR THE YOUNGEST

00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.527
STUDENTS IT'S DIFFICULT FOR

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.262
THEM TO PAY ATTENTION MAKE

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.530
GENERALLY LEARN THROUGH PLAY

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:06.965
AN ENGAGEMENT LETTER LACKING

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:08.634
ANYTHING CLASSROOMS AND IT'S

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.801
DIFFICULT TO BUILD BASIC

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.269
SKILLS LIKE REALLY LITERACY AND

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.938
NUMERACY WITHOUT TEACHER AND

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.407
PEER INTERACTION WELL WE DON'T

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.209
HAVE GREAT DATA ON EARLY GRADE

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:19.711
LEARNING AT SCALE HE DOES HAVE

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.179
AN UPCOMING ANALYSIS SHOWING

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.848
THAT STUDENTS READING CURRENCY

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.650
IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADE IS

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:25.917
SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND BUT WE

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:28.020
WOULD EXPECT IN A TYPICAL YEAR

ACCESS FUTURE BUT WE ALSO HAVE

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:37.596
REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.731
UPPER GRADE STUDENTS ACROSS

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.099
THE STATE -- TROUBLING SIGNS

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:42.300
THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:43.835

IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS SO IT

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.871

HE'S A VERY INTENSE PICTURE BUT

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.228

WE USED TO SAY IN THE CLASSROOM

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:32.796
AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER WAS THAT

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.665

THE CHILDREN CAME FROM THAT

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:38.502
THAT WAS OUT OF OUR CONTROL BUT

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.003
THAT WHAT WE DID HAVE CONTROL

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.338
AS WAS WHEN THE CHILDREN

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.073
CAME TO US AND CAME INTO OUR

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.209
CLASSROOM FOR THAT WHETHER IT

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:47.344
WAS FIFTY MINUTES FOR THAT PART

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.913
OF THE DAY OR FOR THAT DAY THE

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.449

KID WHO DRIED SCHOOL EACH DAY

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.959
IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO WATCH

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.460
OUR HEARTS ARE ALL BREAKING

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.863
FOR STUDENTS AT THIS VERY

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:55.966
MOMENT AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.367
TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.435
BUT THESE ARE GOING TO BE SOME

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.304
LONG TERM NEEDS THAT WE HAVE

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.039
TO HAVE TO ADDRESS FOR FOR

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.207
OUR COMMUNITY SO MY QUESTIONS

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:06.643
THIRTY TO MOTIONAL HERE I

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.046
HEARD FROM MY COMMUNITY WHICH

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.647
ASPECTS OF DISTANCE LEARNING

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.949
HAVE BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE AND

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:15.118
SUPPORTING ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.987
AS WELL AS A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:18.188
DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.990
OF STUDENTS AND WHICH HAVE

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:22.059
BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.872
THIS IS HEATHER HOUSEHOLD ALL

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:38.608
JUMP IN FIRST WE'VE DONE A

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.711
LOT OF RESEARCH OVER IT SINCE

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.279
ESSENTIALLY THE PANDEMIC AND

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:43.880
MARCH TRYING TO GET A SENSE

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:46.283
OF THE RESEARCH BASE BEHIND

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.251
THIS QUESTION WHAT CAN WE DO

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.920
TO MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING WORK

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.521
FOR KIDS KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:54.091
IDEAL AND IT CAN'T BE IDEAL BUT

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.492
A LOT OF WHAT MAKES DISTANCE

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.160
LEARNING WORK FOR CHILDREN IT'S

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:59.062
A LOT OF WHAT MAKES IN PERSON

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:00.497
INSTRUCTION BURKE FOR CHILDREN

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:03.867
TOO IT'S THE MORE THAT YOU CAN

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:06.803
ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE WORK

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.638
THE MORE THAT STUDENTS CAN GET

00:50:08.705 --> 00:50:10.941
FEEDBACK FROM THEIR TEACHER THE

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.442
MORE THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.445
PEERS ON ISSUES OF LEARNED SO

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.047
WHEN DISTANCE LEARNING WORKS

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.548
FOR KIDS IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:20.817
A STRUCTURE IN WHICH THERE

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:23.887
ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:26.590
DOING SMALL GROUP WORK WHO ARE

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:28.291
TRYING TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:29.726
A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW THEY WERE

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:32.095
ENGAGED BEFORE BUT I THINK

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.930
THE FACT TO THAT IS THAT THERE

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.499
ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THERE

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.300
REALLY ISN'T A GOOD ANALOG FOR

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.870
IN DISTANCE LEARNING THANK --

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.805
PHYSICAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.407
THOSE THINGS RIGHT IT'S IT'S

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:44.741
REALLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.710
HOW YOU CAN'T DO A SOCCER

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:49.379
GAME ON SECOND -- THERE ARE

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:51.681
LOTS OF SCIENCE EVENTS FOR

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:53.316
COLLABORATIVE WORK IT REALLY

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.051
IS DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE AND

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.554
ARE NOT SETTING SO AND THEN

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.822
OF COURSE YOU KNOW I I SPOKE

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.124
IN MY TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW EVEN

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.692
ACCESSING THINGS LIKE SMALL

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.294
GROUP WORK AND COLLABORATIVE

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:07.531
TIME OFTEN REQUIRE INTERNADO

00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:08.632
AT HOME YOU CAN MAKE SURE

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:09.933
THAT THE STUDENT IS READY AND

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.468
ENGAGED IN LEARNING AND THAT

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:14.070
CAN BE A HUGE BARRIER -- BUT

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.572
BUT TYPICALLY THAT I THINK

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.541
WOULD BE WHAT MAKES DISTANCE

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:19.075
LEARNING COULD A PERSON

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.144
WHAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.615
THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU I

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:26.750
WILL I WOULD JUST ADD TO I

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.485
THINK AND I THINK OTHER RELATED

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:29.953
STRONG ENGAGEMENT IS ALWAYS

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.122
THE KEY RIGHTS CHILDREN HAVE

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.024
TO BE ENGAGED IN THEIR LEARNING

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.091
BUT IN ORDER TO FEEL LIKE

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:36.460
THEY CAN REALLY PARTICIPATE

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:37.561
AND THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE TO

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.463
FOCUS DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:40.897
SOME AMAZING EDUCATORS HAVE

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.799
BEEN ABLE TO DO IT OR REALLY

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.267
STRATEGIC IN A REALLY FIGURE

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:46.369
OUT WAYS TO PUT KIDS INTO YOUR

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:48.805
VARIOUS -- BREAKOUT GROUPS IN

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:49.906
PARTICULAR GIVING THEM SOME

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.741
PROJECTS TO DO OPPORTUNITIES

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:52.843
TO HAVE THE PEACE I THINK IT'S

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.511
IMPORTANT AS FOLKS ACTUALLY

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.580
REACHING OUT TO KIDS DIRECTLY

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:57.614
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:59.649
IS THE BABY MORE SUPPORTS

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:01.251
-- REACHING OUT TO PARENTS

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.385
IN TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.521
WORKING SPECIFICALLY STRATEGIES

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.323
IDEAS SO THEY CAN COLLECTIVELY

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.358
WORK TOGETHER BY HOW THEY

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.726
CAN SUPPORT THE STUDENT OUR

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.294
HISTORY LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.696
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT THE

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:15.866
NORM THANKS BYE AND SO I THINK

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:16.967
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL STRUGGLE

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.201
WHERE THOSE EXAMPLES OF BEEN

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.803
ABLE TO HELP AND I THINK WE'LL

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.371
SEE MORE SUCCESS AND OBVIOUSLY

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:22.973
WE FOR THE OLDER STUDENTS AND I

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:24.307
SAY THE STUDENTS LIKE ASSEMBLY

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:25.876
MEMBER O'DONNELL ANGLER I AM

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:27.844
A SENIOR AT HOME BUT IT WAS

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:29.513
FAIRLY DISENGAGED BUT SHE'S

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:30.714
COMES NOT REALLY GOOD AT HOME

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.382
AND SHE'S SHE'S DOING FINE

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.617
BUT SHE'S NOT BECAUSE SHE'S

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.585
REALLY ENGAGED IN SCHOOL I'M

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.487
PARTICULAR BUT SHE'S BEEN OKAY

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:38.955
SHE'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT SHE'S

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:40.090
GONNA BE OK AND BE ABLE TO GO

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.825
ON SCHOOL RIGHT WERE IN SOME

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:42.759
OTHER FAMILIES THAT DON'T

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.294
HAVE THOSE TANK TYPE SPORTS

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.829
WHICH WE KNOW EXIST FOR A LOT

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.731
OF OUR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA

00:52:47.797 --> 00:52:50.934
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THANK

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.903
YOU AND ONE MORE QUESTION

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:56.907
-- WHAT DATA POINTS EXIST OR

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:59.242
WHAT POLICY JUST SUGGESTIONS

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:01.678
YOU HAVE AROUND REGRESSION

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.079
FOR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.281
WE TALK ABOUT LEARNING LOSS

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.216
WHICH IS WHICH IS EVIDENT --

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:07.450
BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE SICK

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:09.586
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.655
AND OUR CHILDREN DIAGNOSED

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.390
WITH AUTISM ON A CHILDREN

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:14.224
WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.293
DELAYS AND DISABILITIES --

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:17.627
WHAT ARE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:18.628
AND THE END OF ANY DATA

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.297
POINTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:23.366
TO ADD TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:30.774
HELLO THIS IS CARLA ESTRADA

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.144
WITH THE CCD ONE SUGGESTION

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.378
AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR STUDENTS

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.247
WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.882
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.650
THE PANDEMIC IS TO REALLY

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:41.751
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO START

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.286
IDENTIFYING WHO THOSE STUDENTS

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:45.121
ARE WHAT SERVICES HAVE BEEN

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.957
PROVIDED WHAT HAS NOT AND

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:49.192
AS AS MR MOLINO HAS SHARED

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.193
ALSO REACHING OUT TO THOSE

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.228
FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:53.663

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.755
COMMENT MADE THAT THERE MAY

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:40.756
BE A PLACE WILL THERE IS A

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.624
PLACE GOING FORWARD FOR SOME

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.126
ONLINE LEARNING I THINK ON A

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.661
VERY LIMITED BASIS FOR THOSE

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.863
STUDENTS WHO FIND SUCCESS

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.231
WITH ONLINE LEARNING I THINK

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.532
IT'S BEEN MINIMAL THROUGH THIS

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:52.101
EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK AGAIN

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.670
THERE IS A PLACE BOB BUT WE

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.038
NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:57.506
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.675
WITH NO ETHICS NO DESIRE TO

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.210
ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS YET A

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.078
DESIRE TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.646
THAT HAVE GONE IN TO THE ONLINE

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:05.914
CHARTER SCHOOL BUSINESS MADE

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.283
TONS OF MONEY AND NOT SERVE

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.518
STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.253
CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO BE

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.488
CAREFUL WHEN YOU TO REFORM IT

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:15.124
IS TO BE SIGNIFICANT REFORM

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:17.292
WITH THE -- THE ONLINE CHARTER

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.161
SCHOOL VENTURES THAT WE NOW

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.462
HAVE AN ANY THAT MAY COME

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.698
FORWARD AFTER THE MORATORIUM

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.032
IN WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:24.833
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.868
HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE SCHOOL

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.537
DISTRICTS ONLY AS TO TO ENTER

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.639
THIS VENTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:31.940
PROBABLY BETTER PREPARED ON

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.876
THE ACADEMIC SIDE AND THE

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.110
ACCOUNTABILITY SIDE THAN

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.311
SOMEONE WHO JUST OPENED UP A

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:37.579
SCHOOL OVERNIGHT SAYS GUESS

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:40.616

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.992
CASES THERE HAVE BEEN A FRAUD

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.493
OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NOT

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.694
SERVE STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.863
CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN I'M LOOKING

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.932
FOR THIS INCIDENT SIGNIFICANT

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.067
REFORM TO ENSURE STUDENT

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:02.070

WITH ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:05.407
GOING FORWARD BE THE CHARTER

OR NOT QUITE FRANKLY BUT I DO

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:09.111
APPRECIATE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:10.145
THERE MAY BE A PLACE FOR THIS

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:12.114
TYPE OF LEARNING AND AND AND

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.816
YOU KNOW I DO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.350
BUT AGAIN THERE'S A HARLEY

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.685
THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:19.054
REFORM WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.789

OR THAT SEEK TO DO IT IN THE

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.092
FUTURE OF ANY TYPE WITH THAT

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.160
BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.296
YOU THANK YOU I DO HAVE A

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.831
QUESTION BUT I'LL JUST NOTE

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.299
-- MISTER DONALD THAT AS

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.601
YOU KNOW WE PASSED A LAW --

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:33.669
THAT WE YOU AND I WORKED ON

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:36.271
TOGETHER WHICH IS OUTLAWED --

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:39.474
THESE FOR PROFIT -- ONLINE --

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.711
CHARTERS BUT YOU WERE G.

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.279
OF BILKING TAXPAYERS AND

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:45.647
HAD MASSIVE JUDGMENTS BY

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.648
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:49.151
FRAUDULENT PRACTICES -- BUT

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:49.985
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:51.420
OTHERS WHO ARE NOT FOR PROFIT

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:52.454
THEY COULD GET IN THIS BUSINESS

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:54.189
SO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:55.390
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT FRONT

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.326
AS WELL SO THERE IS A PLACE

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.627
FOR FOR ONLINE I THINK WE'VE

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.762
LEARNED THAT WE ALSO LEARNED

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:01.997
THAT WE HAVE OTHER NATURAL

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.765
DISASTERS THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:04.600
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.235

OF SCHOOL FOR A WEEK OR MORE

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.977
AND HAVING THAT ONLINE DISTANCE

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.678
-- PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.981
I THINK IS VALUABLE IN THE FACT

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.983
WE HAVE HAD A NATURAL DISASTERS

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.784
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.319
NEED TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.321
CONTINUE TO LEARN SO WITH THAT

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.456
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I KNOW

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:28.724
THERE ARE IN THE CHEN ALREADY

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.360

LEARNING STANDARDS AND POLICIES

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.139
SO WHICH ONES DO WE THINK NEED

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.675
CLARIFICATION -- STRENGTHENING

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.311

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.192
CONCLUSION THAT THAT ONE YEAR

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:40.261
OF HIGH QUALITY PRE K.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.129
REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE --

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:44.098
FOR FOR KINDERGARTEN READINESS

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.233

ACHIEVEMENT GAPS -- BUT MORE

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.837
THAN ONE YEAR MULTIPLE YEARS

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.706
AND IN TWO YEARS WOULD MAKE

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:53.074
AN EVEN BIGGER DIFFERENCE AND

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.076
SO -- THAT'S THE ONE THE FIRST

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.277
EXAM WANNA GET AS WITH THE L.

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:56.444
A.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.078
L.

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.646
ASKED IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE

01:31:58.713 --> 01:31:59.881
CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.983
PROGRAM AND IS NOTED WE

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.651
SPEND ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:06.320
EVERY YEAR THREE CD HE TO

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.389
SUBSIDIZE -- FOUR YEAR OLDS

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:09.557
TO PARK LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:10.758
OLD FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:11.559
IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:13.961
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SO IF ALL OF

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.229
A SUDDEN ALL THOSE FOUR YEAR

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:16.264
OLDS WERE IN THE L.

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:16.430
E.

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.031
A.

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.366
BASED TEEKAY THE PROP NINETY

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.267
EIGHT WHICH WE'LL GET TO A

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.067
LITTLE BIT THE FUNDING OF

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:22.370
THAT -- YOU HAVE A BILLION

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:23.638
DOLLARS IT CERTAINLY WE COULD

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.539
EXPAND ACCESS FOR ZERO THREE

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.775
THREE SO THE SAME -- PRESCHOOL

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.010
PROGRAMS CONSERVE MORE THREE

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.044
YEAR OLDS AND WE CAN SERVE

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:31.979
MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:32.914
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT JUST

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.148
FROM THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.950
PERSPECTIVE IF YOU BELIEVE

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:38.019
THAT EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.421
IF YOU ARE A LOW INCOME AND KID

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:41.789
IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU GET TWO

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:45.026
YEARS OF FREE PUBLICLY FUNDED

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:47.061
HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:48.829
THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE A

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.498

GAP AS KIDS INTO THE PUBLIC

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.805
SCHOOL SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT'S

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:58.739
THE ROUTE THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.341
GO CERTAINLY THIS IS A BUDGET

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.709

SIDE THERE ARE COMPANION BILLS

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.279
IN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY

MORALIZING THIS THIS KIND OF

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.684
VISION SO -- THAT BEING SAID

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.552
THE OVERALL VISION AS FAR AS

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:14.555
WHAT WE DO -- NOW AS YOU NOTED

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.223
THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.398
AND HAVE KIDS ENTER BEFORE

01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:26.667
THEY THEY TURN FIVE AND THEN

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:27.802
THEY'RE NOT FUNDED AND THEN

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.403
THEY THEY GET EIGHTY EIGHT

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.439
ONCE THE KID TURNS FIVE --

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:32.707
AND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER SOME

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.075

THAT THE QUESTION HERE ALL

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.413
ASPECTS OF THE MY ONE QUESTION

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.917
HERE ON THIS ONE IS DO WE WANT

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:47.088
TO ALLOW DISTRICTS -- NOW TO

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:49.490
BE MORE -- ENTREPRENEURIAL

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:51.092

COLLECTING -- EIGHTY EIGHT

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.963
RIGHT AWAY IN THIS NEXT YEAR

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.131
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:59.200
THAT FOR EXAMPLE F.

01:33:59.266 --> 01:33:59.400
L.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:33:59.934
A.

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:02.937
STAR THIS -- ON JULY ONE

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:05.339
WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BE

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:07.074
OPEN TO ALLOWING THEM TO GET

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:08.342
EIGHTY EIGHT THROUGHOUT THE

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:09.810
ENTIRE YEAR NOT JUST ONCE THIS

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:12.380
MONTH THE STUDENT TURNS FIVE

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:16.884
THIS IS SERRA BURDEN WITH

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:18.285
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.421
SO THAT PARTICULAR FEATURE

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.757
OF OF EXPANDING THE PROGRAM

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:23.791
AND THAT WAY IT'S ALL PART

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:25.760
OF OUR PROPOSAL -- I KNOW

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.728
THERE'S LARGER CONSIDERATIONS

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:29.130
IN TERMS OF EXPANDING ADA IN

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:31.265
THAT REGARD -- I WOULD HIT

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.500
IT OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.135

I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE SAID

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:48.516
IT YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T HAVE

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.017

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.659
BONDS -- THAT REALLY ALLOWS

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:00.828
US TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.830
FUNDING THAT WE CAN WE CAN PUT

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:04.231
TOWARDS HEALTHIER FAT BY THE

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.966
DANCE CURRENTLY TOWARDS ALL OF

OUR OTHER PROPOSALS LIKE ARE

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.737
NOT SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.772

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:12.873
BY HAVING THIS BE ONE TIED

TO ACCEPT THAT WE ALLOW EIGHT

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:16.243

KNOW YOU HAVE TO REDUCE SOME

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:20.047
OTHER PROPOSAL AND SO THIS

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.048
IS WHAT WE THOUGHT MADE THE

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.616
MOST SENSE AND WAS THE MOST

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.652
PRUDENT IN OUR POWER APPROACH

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:27.054

TO PROVIDE ONE TIME MONEY FOR

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:48.442
DISTRICTS TO -- KENNETH SPRING

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:49.677
INTO THIS WE SHOULD THINK

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:51.745
ABOUT ALLOWING THEM TO GET

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:53.681

CITY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:33.587
THINK THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.335
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.337

IS PHASED OUT OVER MULTIPLE

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.808
YEARS WE DON'T THINK SHORT

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.177
TERM THIS WILL HAVE A LARGE

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:58.946
EFFECT ON TO THE STANDARDS THAT

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:00.080
NEED TO BE A LOT AND AS OF NOW

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.115
HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:02.783
A BIG PART OF WHAT'S OUTLINED

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.385
IN THE MASTER PLAN -- AND

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.520
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:10.124
LONGER TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS THE

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.592
THE NEEDS OF AN EXPANDED TKA

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.227

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:42.089
IMPORTANT TO START ADDRESSING

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.158
IT NOW SO THAT WE DON'T EXPAND

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.493

AND AS YOU LOOK AT HAVING

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.240
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER FORCED

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:01.008

MULTIPLE TEACHERS IN THAT GREAT

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:07.014

REVENUES THAT WILL GO TO PARK

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.773
TO PROPAGATE SO IT'S NOT GONNA

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.108
BE GOING UP OR DOWN BASED ON

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.176

THE CONCERNS FROM SOME FOLKS

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:33.754

KERN I'M THERE IS NOT AN

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:55.329
IMMEDIATE EFFECT IN THE CURRENT

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.230
YEAR IN TERMS OF MAKING CUTS

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:59.333
TO OTHER PROGRAMS WE WERE

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:01.234
WE WE NOTED WE THINK GIVEN

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:03.170
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED YOU COULD

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:05.272
FIND OUT EXPLAINS IN TERMS

NGUYEN YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.809
TO DO MUCH OTHER PROGRAMMATIC

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:10.077
AUGMENTATIONS BUT AGAIN IF IT'S

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:11.211
A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:12.980
WE FIGURED WE DETECTED THE

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.948
DOCTOR WELL UNDER THE CURRENT

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:17.618
ON ROAD FOR CUSTOMER CITY AND

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.319
THEN YOU SEE SAID WERE IN THIS

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:21.221
TEST ONE FOR THE IMMEDIATE

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:23.390
FUTURE WHICH IS A FINITE POT

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:25.759
OF MONEY FOR EDUCATION BUT ONCE

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:27.861
WE LEAVE TEST ONE THEN THESE

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.297
NEW STUDENTS ARE GENERATING

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:31.798
EIGHTY EIGHT PER STUDENT

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:35.268
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT ALTHOUGH

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:37.471
I THINK UNDER THE LATEST --

01:44:37.537 --> 01:44:38.639
IN ORDER OUTLOOK COMMITTEE

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:41.108
MET MOST OF THE LATEST ON

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.076
OUR FORECAST THAT WE'VE DONE

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:44.511
BUT WE DIDN'T TEST ONE IN THE

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.146
FORESEEABLE FUTURE CRIME IN

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:47.314
IN ALMOST THREE HOURS SO I

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:49.282
COULD OR ITS POSITION BECAUSE

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:50.617
I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE IF

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:53.186
THIS ONE ARE MOVING FORWARD

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.555
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO REPORT EVEN

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.190
THE THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS IN

01:44:57.257 --> 01:45:00.293
OUR AND THEN THAT CAN YOU CAN

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.131
YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT THE --

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.700
THAT THE FINANCIAL SCENARIO WHY

01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:09.469
LOOK DISTRICTS WHO HAVE MAJOR

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.538
DECLINING ENROLLMENT ARE SO

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:14.107
INTERESTED IN TEEKAY EXPANSION

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:15.308
BESIDES THE FACT THAT I THINK

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.477
HOPEFULLY AND ALTRUISTIC THINGS

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:18.779
THEY BELIEVE THAT MORE EARLY

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.881
EDUCATION FOR MORE CALIFORNIA'S

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.849
A BETTER THING FOR OUR OUR

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.184
KIDS IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:26.019
ECONOMY AND SO FORTH BUT FROM

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:27.888
A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE YOU

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.690
KNOW MOST DISTRICTS AREN'T

01:45:29.756 --> 01:45:32.392
DECLINING ENROLLMENTS ITSELF

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.695
THE DISTRICTS THAT THAT TAKE

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:36.329
ADVANTAGE OF THIS WHY DID

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:37.464
THE VIEW IT SO FAVORABLY

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:41.034
FINANCIALLY WHAT FROM WHAT

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:42.602
WE'VE BEEN HEARING AT THE

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:43.670
MOMENT WHEN THE DISTRICT

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:44.705
IS IN THE COMING IN WITHOUT

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.872
THE OFTENTIMES WOULD MAKE

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:48.141
HIM -- HELLO MORE FINANCIAL

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:49.242
DIFFICULTIES IN THE PART WAS

01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:51.511
GOING ON AS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING

01:45:51.578 --> 01:45:52.612
YOU KNOW THESE DECLINES ARE

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:54.314
HAPPENING OFTENTIMES PRETTY

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.449
MINOR BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:58.085
SEEING ONE OF YOUR KIDS PER PER

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:00.687
CLASSROOM -- AND STRANDED SO

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.322
YOU'RE ALREADY SMALL DECLINES

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:03.623
BUT YOU HAVE SOME FIXED COSTS

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.125
BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY CUT SO

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.560
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE JUST

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.528
HAVING ONE FEWER KICKOFF IN

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:10.063
YOUR OLD SCHOOL -- YOU'RE

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.431
GONNA GET MUSCLE SPECIFIC

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:12.833
FUNDING BECAUSE OF THAT BUT

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:13.800
YOUR NUMBERS ARE GONNA BE ABLE

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.336
TO REDUCE YOUR MORE HORSES SO

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.771
THOSE THINGS OVER TIME COMPOUND

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:19.339
TO BECOME MORE CHALLENGING

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:21.208
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.142
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:24.211
IF YOU WERE TO EXPAND IT --

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:25.345
THAT COULD OFFSET SOME OF THE

01:46:25.412 --> 01:46:26.847
CLINTON IN A MOMENT I NEED TO

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.348
WRITE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:29.816
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:31.918
TO THE -- TO GET SOME OF THOSE

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:35.188
ADDITIONAL REVENUES -- -- ARE

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:36.656
ARE GREATER THAN THE INCREASED

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:37.657
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.226
COULD NOT BE THAT DISTRICTS

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:41.161
WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL ARE IN

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.229
BETTER FISCAL POSITION THEY

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:44.931
MIGHT BE ABLE PERFECT AND IN

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:46.399
LAST FINANCIAL QUESTION ABOUT

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.367
THIS I KIND OF MENTIONED THIS

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.336
EARLIER BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.872
TO THE NOTION THAT THE FACT

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:54.074
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DECLINING

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:55.509
ENROLLMENT WHAT'S THAT DROPPED

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:56.376
AGAIN THE PERCENTAGE WERE

01:46:56.443 --> 01:46:58.779
DROPPING BY EVERY YEAR DECLINE

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.981
WE WE HAVE BEEN DROPPING BY

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.716
IT'S LESS THAN ONE PERCENT BOTH

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:04.384
GOING TO COME TO THE RIGHT THE

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:05.519
MOST RECENT DATA WE'VE BEEN

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:06.686
DROPPING I THINK OUR FOCUS

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:08.088
WAS MORE THAN ABOUT ONE AND

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.189
A HALF PERCENT FOR THE COMING

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:10.957
YEAR YEAH AND OF COURSE IS

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:12.159
THIS PAST YEAR WAS YOU KNOW

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:14.161
ALL THAT'S ROTH AND ALL KINDS

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.562
OF FUNKY NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.397
THAT PANDEMIC WITH SPECIALLY

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:19.366
THE EARLIER YOUNGER GRADES SO

01:47:19.432 --> 01:47:20.867
THIS NOTION THAT WE ARE HAVING

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:22.302
DECLINING IN ENROLLMENT SO

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:24.271
WE'RE SERVING THE OUR STUDENTS

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:25.939
AND THEN PROP NINETY EIGHT AS

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:28.074
AT THIS ALL TIME HIGH GRANTED

01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:29.176
SOMEONE SAY SCHOOLS ARE WERE

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.310
NOT PROPERLY FUND IN THE FIRST

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:32.445
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:33.880
DO YOU RESPOND TO THE NOTION

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:36.183
THAT WELL IF YOU HAVE IF YOU

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.084
IF IF CALIFORNIANS HAVING FEWER

01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:39.653
KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:41.288
SYSTEM WE'RE GIVING THE PUBLIC

01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:42.622
EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE MONEY

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:45.125
ANYWAY -- MAYBE DOESN'T IT

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.060
ISN'T THAT ISN'T THAT MUCH

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:48.395
OF A STRETCH TO TO THROW AN

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:51.464
ADDITIONAL RTK KIDS IN THE MIX

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:54.668
PEOPLE WE RECORDS WAS THAT

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:56.136
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IS IS

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.938
JUST HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPEND

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:58.905
WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN A

01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.673
WAY THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.508
BEST FOR CERTAIN DIFFERENCES

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:03.410
SO OBVIOUSLY IN THERE ARE

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:04.244
THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS ARE

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:05.478
YOU CAN DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:07.180
YOU WANT TO USE SOME OF THOSE

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:09.249
INCREASES FUNDING TO AUGMENT

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:10.584
OR SUPPLEMENT YOUR EXISTING

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:11.985
CONTROL PROGRAMS OF CIRCUITS

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:13.019
WERE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:14.955
SCHOOL THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:16.423
COURSE YOU COULD TAKE ANOTHER

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:17.190
APPROACH IF YOU'RE DOING

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:18.158
SOMETHING LIKE TO K.

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:19.326
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TAKEN

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:20.827
OFF OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.095
THIS IS A REAL ONE OF THEIR

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:23.964
KEY FUNDING FOR THE EARLIER

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.466
GRADES WE WANT TO HELP SUPPORT

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:28.034
AND EXPAND PRESCHOOL SERVICES

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.302
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.872
SUPPOSED TO HAVE -- YOUR

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:33.473
BENEFITS FIRST INFINITY LATER

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.741
DOWN THE LINE I THINK THEY'RE

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.842
GONNA BE DOING BETTER WE THINK

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:37.377
ANY OF THOSE OF COURSE ISN'T SO

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:39.546
I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE --

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:41.281
YOU KNOW IT BURLESQUE CONCERNS

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.515
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT YOU

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.451
NEED YOU GENERATED AND MORE

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.518
AT THE CAN BROADLY ABOUT THE

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:46.753
AMOUNT OF PROPERTY WHEN YOU'RE

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.854
AVAILABLE WHAT MIGHT BE THE

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:49.589
BEST USES WILL SPEND THOSE

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:52.158
FUNDS TO THE BANK BECAUSE

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:57.998
OKAY AND THEN LASTLY I I DIDN'T

01:48:58.064 --> 01:49:00.667
GET TO IT BUT AS THE AGENDA

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.402
ALLUDES TO ONE OF THE REASONS

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:03.904
THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR IN

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.572
THE MASTER PLAN AND CAN BRACE

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:07.540
TEEKAY NOT THIS IS THE MOST

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:09.776
LOGICAL WE ALREADY HAVE A TAKE

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.778
A SYSTEM IN PLACE IT'S WE HAVE

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.580
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND YOU

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:14.614
COULD HAVE A PART PROFESSIONAL

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:15.615
AND THEY'RE STILL PICK THE

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:17.550
CORRECT RATIO OF IS THE FACT

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:19.719
THAT -- IN A RESEARCH SHOWS

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:21.755
THAT A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM IS A

01:49:21.821 --> 01:49:23.390
BETTER PROGRAM ON YOU SIR YOU

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:24.791
SERVE BROADER SEGMENT OF THE

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.726
POPULATION -- PLUS YOU DON'T

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.561
HAVE THIS INEQUITY WORK ON KIDS

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:30.297
BORN DURING THE FALL WHEN THE

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.065
LOTTERY GET A FREE YEAR OF OF

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:34.668
PUBLICLY FUNDED PRE K.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:39.306
ABOUT HOW FOR -- A ART

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.674
OTHERS THAT THAT T.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.174
K.

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.108
REALLY IS A DIFFERENCE

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:44.711
MAKER AND HELPS ALL GROUPS

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:45.812
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO

01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:47.480
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN WE

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:48.648
HAVE ESSENTIALLY A TEN YEAR

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:50.317
PILOT PROJECT WITH A QUARTER

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:52.052
OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND

01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:53.987
THAT'S SHOWN TO BE OKAY SO

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:54.821
I I KNOW WE HAVE A SOMEONE

01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:55.789
EVERYBODY THAT ESTIMATES

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:58.358
ON THE NUMBER OF DONALD

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:02.162
WELL I'M REALLY EXCITED

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:02.963
TO BE PART OF THIS

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:05.298
CONVERSATION AND EXPANDING --

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:06.866
POSSIBLY SEVENTY K.

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:09.903
-- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.237
SEE IN MY DISTRICT DISASTER

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:12.372
PLANNING AND ROMAN WE KNOW

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:13.406
THAT THERE'S GOING PROP NINETY

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:15.141
EIGHT DOLLARS IN BONDS A BILL

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:17.310
AVAILABLE BUT THIS IS ALSO

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.045
A REALLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT

01:50:19.112 --> 01:50:19.813
FOR US TO HELP THE MIDDLE

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:22.148
CLASS AND THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:23.616
WHO CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:25.986
ACCESS TO QUALITY PRESCHOOL

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:27.253
BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.822
MONEY TO PAY FOR IT BUT THEN

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:30.357
THEY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY AND

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:31.725
DON'T NECESSARILY QUALIFY FOR

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:33.560
STATE PRESCHOOL HEAD START

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:36.396
-- STAGE -- CAL WORKS AT ON

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:38.164
TOP OF IT IT'S PROBABLY THE

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:40.433
MOST CRITICAL AND CRUCIAL TIME

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.936
THAT WE FUND AND EXPAND TKA

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.804
-- BECAUSE OUR KIDS THAT AND

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:45.672
I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO WILL

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.874
BE FOUR IN APRIL SO THIS IS A

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:49.109
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ME

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:50.410
PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:52.045
AND GIVEN MY BACKGROUND AS A

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:54.080
PRESCHOOL PROVIDER BUT FOR THE

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:56.249
LAST YEAR THREE AND FOUR YEAR

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:58.551
OLDS HAVE BEEN AT HOME AND

01:50:58.618 --> 01:50:59.519
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BIRTHDAY

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.287
PARTIES THEY'RE NOT HANGING

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.957
OUT IN IN YOU KNOW IN PLACES

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:05.358
WHERE THEY'RE PLAYING WITH

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.394
OTHER KIDS WERE EVEN THOUGH

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.496
IT MAY NOT BE IN THE CLASSROOM

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:10.563
OR PLAYBASE SETTING LIKE

01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.632
QUALITY CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:14.968
ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

01:51:15.168 --> 01:51:16.369
COMPONENTS OF FOUNDATIONS THAT

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:17.871

ENVIRONMENTS ARE NOT HAVEN'T

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:20.774
BEEN HAPPENING FOR A YEAR SO

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:21.975
THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL TIME

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:24.277
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION --

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:26.179
UNLIKE MY FIRST QUESTIONS ARE

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:28.014
-- UP QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS --

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:29.049
UNLIKE THE CURRENT T.

K.

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:30.316
PROGRAM WHICH IS BASED ON

01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:32.419
ELIGIBILITY THE GOVERNOR'S

HE CAN ROMAN PROPOSAL WOULD

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.255
PRIORITIZE GRANT FUNDING

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:38.324
BASED IN PART ON ELEAZAR --

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.260
PROPORTION OF ADULT LANGUAGE A

01:51:40.326 --> 01:51:43.463
BILL LANGUAGE STUDENTS I'M WHY

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:46.199
NOT TAKE A PHASED IN APPROACH

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:47.967
AVAIL OF ELIGIBILITY SIMILAR

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:51.971
TO WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE AND

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:54.340
IT MOVED KINDERGARTEN FROM

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.443
DECEMBER SECOND CUT OFF TO --

01:51:56.509 --> 01:51:58.411
SEPTEMBER SECOND CUT OFF WHY

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.412
COULDN'T WE JUST KIND OF DO A

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:02.282
REVERSE PHASE AND -- LEAD THAT

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.683
-- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:04.784
DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD YOU

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:06.052
BE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:08.121
THAT AND IT AND THE FOLLOW

01:52:08.188 --> 01:52:09.589
UP QUESTION THERE AS WELL IS

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:10.557
IS IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:11.858
GOAL TO PRIORITIZE T.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:14.094
CARROLL MET FOR ASK RIP RISK

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.429
POPULATIONS WHILE KATIE TWELVE

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:18.198
MAINTAINS UNIVERSAL ACCESS

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:24.537
HELLO AGAIN THIS IS -- SERRA

01:52:24.604 --> 01:52:25.505
BURNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.640
OF FINANCE SO ON TO GET YOUR

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:29.109
FIRST QUESTION ABOUT PHASING

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:31.478
IN THIS PROGRAM SO SO THESE

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.046
PARTICULAR PROPOSALS ARE REALLY

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:34.747
FOCUSED ON BUILDING CAPACITY IN

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:37.350
THE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT OF MORE

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:39.452
TRANSIT MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:40.787
FAMILIES ACCESS TRANSITIONAL

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:41.721
KINDERGARTEN AND EARLY

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:42.956
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:44.290
ON THAT'S WHY WHAT YOU SEE

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:46.226
IN THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:48.728
UP UP GRANT PROGRAMS FOR

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:50.029
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:51.764
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN FOR

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.133
THESE INCENTIVE GRANTS I'M

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:54.000
NOT TO MENTION THE PART OF

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.768
THE INCENTIVE GRANTS TO --

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:57.137
ARE PHASED IN OVER MULTIPLE

01:52:57.203 --> 01:52:58.838
YEARS -- AND THE REASON FOR

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:00.039
DOING THIS IS SO THAT WE'RE

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:01.274
ABLE TO COLLECT DATA ON THE

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:02.542
FIRST YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.711
TWO TO SEE HOW MANY MORE A

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:06.779
FOUR YEAR OLD ELLIE IS WILL

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:08.248
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:09.916
FOR -- THEN PROVIDE THE GRANT

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.951
FUNDING IN THE LATTER TWO YEARS

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:13.319
SO WE BELIEVE THAT COUPLED

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:14.487
WITH THE CAPACITY BUILDING

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:15.522
MEASURES FOR PROFESSIONAL

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:16.756
DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.658
WILL PROVIDE A VERY STRONG

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:20.360
BASED ON FOR EXPANDING THE

01:53:20.426 --> 01:53:21.461
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.596
PROGRAM -- AND THEN TO YOUR

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:25.231
SECOND QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.766
OR NOT THIS PRIORITIZE IS AT

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:29.969
RISK -- STUDENTS ARE THERE IS

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:32.272
LANGUAGE WITHIN THE PROPOSALS

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:33.406
THAT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE

01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:35.141
PRIORITIES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.277
FROM GRANT APPLICATIONS WHICH

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:40.113
INCLUDE VARIOUS PRIORITIES LIKE

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.614
ELLIE IS THAT SERVE A HIGHER

01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:42.749
PROPORTION OF THE LANGUAGE

01:53:42.815 --> 01:53:44.517
LEARNERS INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:47.587
-- AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:48.688
HOPEFULLY THAT GETS AYE BOTH

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:50.490
OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S A

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:51.457
LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO THE

01:53:51.524 --> 01:53:54.561
PROPOSAL'S THEMSELVES GOT IT M.

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:56.062
IS THE T.

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:57.630
CAN ROMAN PROPOSAL LIMITED TO

01:53:57.697 --> 01:53:58.965
ONE TIME FUNDING BECAUSE THE

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:00.166
ADMINISTRATION THINKS START UP

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:02.735
COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY BARRIER

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.305
IN EXPANDING THE PROGRAMS OR DO

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.207
OTHER PRIORITIES LIMIT ON GOING

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:09.943
FUNDING AND WHAT PRIORITIES

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:12.512
WOULD YOU SAY ARE LIMITING

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:16.482
YEAH SO I I WOULD SAY THAT

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.617
THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF THAT

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:19.485
THAT HAVING THESE CAPACITY

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:20.553
BUILDING MEASURES IS REALLY

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.622
IMPORTANT GETTING THESE --

01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:24.991
ONE TIME DOLLARS INTO START

01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:26.826
BUILDING THE STRUCTURE IS

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:28.528
WHAT'S DRIVING MOST OF WHAT

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:29.929
YOU SEE IN THESE PROPOSALS

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:32.432
-- AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ALWAYS

01:54:32.498 --> 01:54:34.934
BALANCING IN OUR FISCAL PICTURE

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.002
AS WELL SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.070
PART OF IT BUT WE DEFINITELY

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:40.273
SEE A NEED FOR ADDING THESE

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.975
SUPPORTS DOING IT WITH THESE

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:43.076
DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:44.544
NOW IN ORDER TO BUILD OFF

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:47.614
OF THAT AT A LATER TIME

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:49.582
IS A PROPOSED

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:50.583

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.620
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE L.

SO IT IS INTENDED TO BE

01:55:05.598 --> 01:55:08.268
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT ELEAZER

IT DOESN'T QUITE GET AT THAT

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.587
RATIO QUESTIONS BUT THE INTENT

AS FAR AS PRUDENT C.

IS CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:11.190
OUTLOOK -- I REMIND FOLKS THAT

02:02:11.257 --> 02:02:12.425

THE GOVERNOR'S WHAT'S PROPOSED

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:14.427
EVEN WITH ALL THE THE FUNDING

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:15.494
THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:17.430

02:02:17.496 --> 02:02:19.832
REBOUND OR REVENUE -- AFTER

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:21.333
COAL BIT SO DIFFERENT BEING SO

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.268
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:23.269
WAS GOING AFTER THE BUDGET

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.204
ACT WE ARE STILL PROPOSING

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:26.372

IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:32.611
AND I DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE

02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:35.181
UNDERSTATED SO AT THE MOMENT

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:37.316
THAT'S WHY I KEEP REALLY IN

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:38.818
A COUNTY NOTHING DRUM THAT

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:40.386
-- THE BUDGET AS WE PROPOSE

02:02:40.453 --> 02:02:41.420
THAT WE REALLY FEEL IS THE

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:42.988
MOST APPROPRIATE MAKES UP ONE

02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:45.257
TIME AND ONGOING FUNDS AND TO

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:47.159
THE EXTENT THAT WE WORK TO A

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:48.828
WEEK WE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.730
-- AND AND SAY THAT CAUTION

02:02:50.796 --> 02:02:52.565
IS WARRANTED AROUND ALL OF A

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:54.166
SUDDEN HAVING IT YES THE INFLUX

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:56.202
OF ADA AND WHILE SOME ELLIE AS

02:02:56.268 --> 02:02:58.370
MATE MIGHT FIND THAT HELPFUL

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:00.539
-- IT COULD PUT US VERY QUICKLY

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.441
AND A AND A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:04.477
ONGOING FUNDING AVAILABILITY

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:06.879
-- CONVERSATION THAN WE THINK

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:10.449

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.125
COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO'S

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:21.093
ADVOCACY TO INCREASE T.

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:21.660
K.

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:24.296
AND SURVIVE IN A PRESCHOOL

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.531
CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE THEY

02:03:25.598 --> 02:03:27.032
NEED AN ADVOCATE BUT I ALSO

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:29.001
THINK THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:31.036
WHAT TO CAN HALF THE GRADE

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:33.739
TWELVE -- NEED AN ADVOCATE

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.308
TO AND MY CONCERN WAS SOME OF

02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:38.711
THE SOME OF THE PROPOSALS IS

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:39.845
THERE REALLY THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:41.147
THEY'RE PRACTICAL AND FISCAL

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:42.948
RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT DO I

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:44.150
MEAN BY THAT CERTAINLY I WANT

02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:46.819
TO SERVE AND DEVELOP A SYSTEM

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.187
FOR FOR FREE SCHOOL STUDENTS

02:03:48.254 --> 02:03:49.421
AND TO FIND IT AND FIND IT

02:03:49.488 --> 02:03:51.624
IS KEY BUT MY FEARS WERE JUST

02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:52.992
TAKING FROM OTHER STUDENTS

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:54.293
AND GIVING IT TO SOME STUDENTS

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.194
AND THAT THAT'S WHERE MY

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:56.962
CONCERN COMES IN AND I'M SURE

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.831
THAT BEFORE IN THIS COMMITTEE

02:03:58.898 --> 02:03:59.899
AND I THINK THE L.

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:00.533
A.

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:01.200
-- ACTUALLY ALLUDED TO IT WHAT

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:02.301
THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:06.939
PROPOSALS MIGHT BE -- IT COULD

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:09.108
BE IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT WE

02:04:09.175 --> 02:04:10.209
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:12.278
ADDING A GRADE LEVEL TO AN

02:04:12.344 --> 02:04:14.780
ALREADY UNDER FUNDED T.

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:16.315
CAN HAVE TWELVE SYSTEM THAT'S

02:04:16.382 --> 02:04:18.117
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:04:18.184 --> 02:04:19.685
AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:20.953
WITHOUT ADDING MORE MONEY TO

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.955
THAT SYSTEM WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST

02:04:23.022 --> 02:04:23.789
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOWERING THE

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:25.457
TIGHT WE'RE LOWERING THE THE

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:26.859
AMOUNT WE FUND ALL GRADES HAD

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:29.061
IN AN IN AN ALREADY RADICALLY

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:31.363
UNDER FUNDED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.098
WHERE ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:35.401
NATION ON A PER STUDENT BASIS

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:36.569
AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:38.304
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT WITHIN

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:40.339
THESE PROPOSALS I JUST UNDER

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.974
FUNDING EVERYBODY AND ADDING

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.576
STUDENTS I DON'T THINK REALLY

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:45.945
HELPS I THINK YEAH ADEQUATELY

02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:47.213
FUNDING ALL STUDENTS IS REALLY

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:49.381
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IF

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:50.916
WE HAD IF WE HAD A T.

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:51.750
CARE DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:54.253
TAKING AWAY FROM SIX CREATORS

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.121
IT -- EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:57.189
AND THAT'S MORE QUESTIONS

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:58.624
THIS TIME THAN THEY REALLY AN

02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:00.793
OPINION BUT THAT THERE ARE IN A

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.261
LIFE OF THE POLICY DILEMMA AND

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:03.462
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A BODY

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:05.331
TO ADDRESS -- AND I'M LOOKING

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:06.232
AT THIS WHAT THREE HUNDRED

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.067
MILLION FOR TO CANCEL THEY CAN

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:09.768
-- FACILITIES THAT SEEMS TO BE

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.537
RESPONSIBLE ONE TIME RIGHT ONE

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:14.073
TIME CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FIFTY

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:15.708
MILLION FOR EARLY EDUCATION

02:05:15.774 --> 02:05:16.976
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:19.478
ONE TIME MONEY TO ONE TIME

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.180
EXPENDITURES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:05:21.247 --> 02:05:22.748
MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:23.916
NINETY EIGHT FOR GRANTS TO

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:26.485
INCREASE EARLY ACCESS I ASSUME

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:29.121
THAT MEANS LOTS OF FOR TEA CASE

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:30.422
STUDENTS I HAVE TO QUESTION

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:31.457
THE PRACTICAL AND FISCAL

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:32.825
RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARENA SAY

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:34.960
FOR ONE YEAR YOU HIRE TEACHERS

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:37.029
FOR ONE YEAR YOU DEVELOP

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.831
FACILITIES FOR THE STUDENTS

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:40.032
WE SHOULD HAVE A GREATER

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:42.902
COMMITMENT TO THAT EFFORT THAN

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:44.370
JUST ONE YEAR AND I GET WHY

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:45.838
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ONE

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:47.706
YEAR IS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:48.607
TO COMMIT THAT MONEY IN THE

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:50.476
OUT YEARS BECAUSE IF WE HAD A

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.411
ROUGHER TIMES IN THE ULTIMATE

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:54.680
IMPACT COULD BE THAT THEY WERE

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.715
TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER

02:05:56.782 --> 02:05:57.917
GROUPS WERE JUST ADDING GRAYSON

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.752
FLATTENING THE AMOUNT SO THOSE

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:00.886
ARE KIND OF MY CONCERNS I MEAN

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.154
IT WAS EVEN ALLUDED TO THERE

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:03.188
SO -- WHAT SOMEONE FROM THE

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:04.323
SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE AND AS

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:05.391
SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORT THAT TO

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:06.926
FROM WHAT WAS YOUR WITH THEM

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:08.360
KIND OF YOU KNOW THANK YOU

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:09.328
SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:11.196
THE IMPACT OF THAT IS AYE ONE

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:12.164
OF THE ONE OF THE FOLKS FROM

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:13.065
THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE

02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:14.400
MERELY TALK ABOUT CLASS SIZE

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:16.969
REDUCTION FOR TEEKAY WE'VE GOT

02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:18.604
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS THAT ARE

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:19.838
TEACHING LANGUAGE ARTS WITH

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.240
THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN THE

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:23.342
CLASSROOM THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.543
IN THE CLASS AND THAT'S THIRTY

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:26.211
EIGHT ESSAYS OF THEIR TEACHING

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.479
FIVE PERIODS A DAY DO THE

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.481
MATH FIVE TIMES THIRTY EIGHT

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:31.550
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT THOSE THINGS

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.052
YEAH AND YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:34.653
STUDENTS ENGAGE IN THE DID YOU

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.721
GET YOU GET YOU KNOW TO KNOW

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:37.589
YOUR STUDENTS AND WE NEED CLASS

02:06:37.656 --> 02:06:38.490
SIZE REDUCTION IN THE HIGH

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:41.627
SCHOOL LEVEL -- SO AGAIN I I

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:42.928
THINK -- YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.163
HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:45.931
THAT ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:46.932
THAT THEY SEE THIS IS THEIR

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.934
PATH TO REMAINING FISCALLY

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:50.235
SOLVENT I'M OPEN TO THAT I'M

02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:52.004
SURE I WILL HEAR IT NOW AND I'M

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.806
I'M QUITE OPEN TO HEARING THAT

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:55.007
THAT THIS IS HOW THEY'RE GOING

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.141
TO REMAIN FISCALLY SOLVENT

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.242
BUT I THINK THE RESPONSIBLE

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:59.278
THING FOR US TO DO AS A BODY

02:06:59.345 --> 02:07:00.579
IS TO COME TOGETHER AND SEE

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.648
HOW IDENTIFY HOW WE'RE GOING

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:04.450
TO PAY FOR THIS SO THAT WE DO

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:05.951
AT STUDENTS WE SCORE UP THE

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:07.619
FUNDING RIGHT WE JUST DON'T ADD

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:10.222
STUDENTS TO TO TO AN EXISTING

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.824
POOL OF DOLLARS AND THE L.

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:11.991
A.

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:12.591
O.

02:07:12.658 --> 02:07:14.660
HAS PULLED POINTED OUT THAT

02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:16.929
THE DOLLARS ARE STATIC MAYBE

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:18.097
IN A TEST TO YEAR THEY'RE NOT

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:19.498
AS THE CHAIRS POINT OUT WHERE

02:07:19.565 --> 02:07:22.001
TO TEST ONE YEAR OF THIS YEAR

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:23.268
BUT I REALLY THINK AS A BODY

02:07:23.335 --> 02:07:24.770
WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND

02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:26.438
IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE OF

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:29.108
FUNDING TO FUND FREE SCHOOL

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.110
EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:33.512
CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T THINK

02:07:33.579 --> 02:07:35.047
-- IT'S FAIR TO SAY IT'S THE

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:36.482
EXISTING BUCKET OF DOLLARS THAT

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:38.017
WE NOW USED TO FUND K.

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:40.352
TWELVE EDUCATION SO THAT THAT

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:42.321
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S MY

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:43.856
POINT OF VIEW -- I KNOW WILL

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.157
HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:47.092
THIS POLICY TOPIC I'VE BEEN

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:48.327
KIND OF FERVENT ON THIS POINT

02:07:48.394 --> 02:07:49.628
NOT EVERYBODY APPRECIATES IT

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.497
BUT I THINK SOME DO THAT I

02:07:51.563 --> 02:07:53.032
WANT I ASSURE THEIR GOAL IT'S

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:54.166
JUST HOW WE GET THERE IS WHERE

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.368
WE DIFFER AND THE IMPACTS OF

02:07:56.435 --> 02:07:57.636
SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT HAVE

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:58.771
BEEN PROPOSED WHAT WHAT THOSE

02:07:58.837 --> 02:08:01.240
IMPACTS WILL BE ON THE EXISTING

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.975
-- DOLLAR POOL EXISTING STUDENT

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.343
PULL SO WITH THAT I TURN

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:05.177
IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:07.212

-- HAVE THE ABLE TO RESPOND

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:10.582
I THINK I THINK IT'S IT'S

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:11.750
ALL MEANT TO BE HONEST WITH

02:08:11.817 --> 02:08:13.218

MADE MY POINT -- THE ONLY --

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:17.256
SPECIFICALLY CITED THAT WE'RE

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:18.457
NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO GROW

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:19.792
DOLLARS IF WE GROW THE NUMBER

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:22.961
OF STUDENTS -- -- SOME IMPACTS

02:08:23.028 --> 02:08:23.996
OF WEATHER NO IT'S JUST WATER

02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:26.131
TEST TO HEAR EVEN JUST THREE

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:28.267
ULTIMATELY -- BUT I THINK IT'S

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:29.301
ALL BEEN HIGHLIGHTED I THINK

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:30.335
YOU DID A GOOD JOB OF ASKING

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.104
YOUR QUESTIONS AND I THINK THEY

02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:34.840
MADE MY POINT QUITE FRANKLY AND

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:37.109
-- BUT AGAIN I SHARE YOUR GOAL

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:39.678
IN FINDING A PATH TO FINDING

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:41.246
TEEKAY FOR ALL PRE K.

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:42.281
FOR ALL REALLY HAS BEEN YOUR

02:08:42.347 --> 02:08:43.549
MISSION MISSING MCCARTY ON A

YOU KNOW FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:47.152
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO

FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WE

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:51.090
DO HAVE AN UNDERFUNDED K.

02:08:51.156 --> 02:08:53.158
TWELVE SYSTEM TODAY AND TO

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:55.894
JUST ADD STUDENTS DOESN'T

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:58.230
NECESSARILY SOLVE OUR

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:00.799
OUR OUR OUR OUR PROBLEM

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:03.669
THANK YOU THANK YOU I I THINK

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:06.405
THAT YOU KNOW YOU AND I CHAIR

COMMITTEE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

02:09:09.241 --> 02:09:10.776
THIS AT IN LENGTH YOU KNOW

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:12.344
GOING BACK TO EARLIER YEARS

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:13.912
AS FAR AS EXPANDING STATE

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.447
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IF THAT MONEY

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:17.149
COMES FROM PROPAGATOR OUTSIDE

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.784
AND YEAH I CONCUR THAT WE ARE

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:23.522
READILY -- -- UNDERFUNDING

02:09:24.523 --> 02:09:26.058
PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT'S WHY

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.759
MR MARTUCCI HAD THAT BILL LAST

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:30.195
YEAR TO GET LCF UP TO THAT

02:09:30.262 --> 02:09:31.363
FUNDING THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:32.631
WHICH WOULD SIGN I AM IN FULL

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:35.501
SUPPORT -- I DO THINK THAT

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:38.203
THERE IS A DIFFERENT EQUATION

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.172
HERE THAT WITH THAT PERCEPTIVE

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.406
DECLINING AND DECLINING

02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:42.941
ENROLLMENT YOU WILL HEAR FROM

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:44.376
SOME YOUR DISTRICTS INCLUDING

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:46.278
MANY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:09:46.345 --> 02:09:47.846
WHO ARE SPONSORS OF THIS EFFORT

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.014
TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY REALLY

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:51.416
FEEL THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.551
THING TO DO AND WHEN I'VE

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:54.553
TALKED TO DISTRICTS THEY REALLY

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.088
HAVEN'T HAD TO DRESS TOO MUCH

02:09:56.155 --> 02:09:59.158
OF NOT -- GETTING AT A PER SE

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:01.126
THEY'RE ASKING THE QUESTIONS

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:02.594
THAT DESPITE OURS WAS ASKING

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.062
ABOUT WELL WOULD YOU DO IT

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:06.732
OVER ONE YEAR ENOUGH TO DO IT

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.167
PHASES OVER FIVE YEARS OKAY

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:09.801
WE CAN KIND OF STOMACH THAT

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:10.869
WE COULD GET A PHASE IT IN

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:12.838
A KIND OF GRADUALLY ASSUME

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:15.374
THAT THAT INCREASE -- WHAT

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.075
ABOUT FACILITIES WHAT ABOUT

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:18.510
-- WORKFORCE TRAINING SO THOSE

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:19.645
ARE THE ISSUES THAT I'VE HEARD

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:20.412
AND WHEN A WE'RE GOING TO HEAR

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:22.080
THAT IT WHEN YOU'RE SHOPPING

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:24.716
A FEW MONTHS -- BUT -- THE

02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:25.918
OTHER THING THAT I THINK IT

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:28.253
IS JUST DIFFERENT HERE IS THIS

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.556
NOTION THAT WE HAVE SOME MONEY

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:31.757
THAT COULD GO TO THE RAINY

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:32.824
DAY FUND GRANT THAT MONEY

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:33.959
IS NOT AVAILABLE TO SAVE THE

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.494
SCHOOLS THAT WE HAVE AT THE

02:10:35.561 --> 02:10:37.496
END OF THE RECESSION BUT THAT

02:10:37.563 --> 02:10:39.464
HASN'T INTERPLATE WITH THIS --

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:43.068
EXPANSION OF NEW KIDS NTK WITH

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:44.670
NOT HAVING AS MUCH OF A DROP

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.838
IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT SO BUT

02:10:46.905 --> 02:10:48.540
HERE BUT LOOK WE'RE HERE TODAY

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:50.075
TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:54.580
THREE PROPOSALS -- -- -- ALL

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:57.783
ONE TIME PROPOSALS BUT I THINK

02:10:57.849 --> 02:10:59.284
THAT THE KEY QUESTION IS AND

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:00.552
AGAIN I ASKED AS THE GOVERNOR

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:04.189
HAS EMBRACED -- UNIVERSAL T.

02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:04.756
K.

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:07.059
-- TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:08.493
MEANS TESTED THAT MIDDLE CLASS

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.396
FAMILIES CAN PARTICIPATE AND

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:12.764
SO IN THE GOVERNOR PUTS IN

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:14.533
ONE TIME MONEY I SEE IT BERMAN

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.701
FINANCE SAYS THAT YOU THINK

02:11:15.767 --> 02:11:16.969
THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY TO ADD

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:20.572
TO TO ACCOMMODATE THIS INITIAL

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.307
EXPANSION AND AND THAT AGAIN

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:23.942
