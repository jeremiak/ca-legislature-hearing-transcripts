ITS PROGRAMS LIKE THE PROMO TORAS THAT REALLY START TO HELP TO DEAL WITH CULTURAL SENSITIVITIES AND ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S THE IDENTIFICATION THAT THERE ARE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES WITH HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE MEETS. AND THAT THE RECENT INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE AT A STATE BOTH HELP WITH LOAN REPAYMENT AS WELL AS INCREASING RESIDENCY SPOTS HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I AM EXCITED. FOR THE DISCUSSION THAT COMES FURTHER ALONG. I AM SO PLEASED. THAT WE'RE HERE IN THE CITY OF FRESNO BUT I WOULD JUST ASK. THAT WE NOT FORGET ARE MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES.

OF CATHLEEN GALGIANI AS WELL AS MITCHELL IN. MISTER RANDY LARA WHO YOU KNOW. THE PATH THE PATH FOR US TO BE ABLE. TO TO BE HERE AND LEARN FROM THEM AND I THINK THAT OUR PERSONAL STORIES USUALLY INFORM. OUR DECISION MAKING AS WELL AND THIS ISSUE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME I'M NOT ONLY AS A STATE SENATOR BUT AS AN EDUCATOR I WAS A TEACHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND I SAW SO MANY OF OUR KIDS THAT WERE STRUGGLING. WITH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND DYING I RAN INTO SO MANY OF MY FAMILY'S FOR SLEEPING IN CARS AND DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. OUR CHILDREN THEY CAME TO SCHOOL WITH THE SAME CLOTHING AND IT WAS OBVIOUS AFTER A LITTLE WHILE AND SO. ALL THESE THINGS I BROUGHT TO ME WITH TO THE STATE SENATE IT REALLY DOES. HELP INFORM HOW I RECEIVED THE POLICY -- ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN. THOSE CHILDREN AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE I YOU KNOW IT'S I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT MY BACKGROUND I HAPPEN TO BE PROBABLY THE ONLY UNDOCUMENTED DEPORTED STATE SENATOR NOT TO SERVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT'S A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY MY FATHER WAS ALSO A FARM WORKER AND SO WE BRING ALL OF THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH POLICY. BUT YET. GOING DEEPER IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY LISTENING. TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IN TERMS OF MY EXPERIENCE BUT THAT OF MY STUDENTS AND OUT OF ALL OF YOU SO ALL OF US REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND LOOKING INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. WHICH I HAPPEN TO TO REPRESENT I AM ALSO A STATE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THAT I REPRESENT THE SINGER VALLEY WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT. EAST AND SELF THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND TO THE FRESNO CITY COUNCIL -- TO FOR ALLOWING US TO TO USE OUR FACILITY -- I WILL ALSO SAY A FEW WORDS IN SPANISH IF I BY MAY.

THANK YOU SO TO GALGIANI. THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND THE TOPIC OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND PARTICULARLY NOW THE TIMING IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THE STATE. IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN SO MANY YEARS WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I REPRESENTED PER SE THIRD TELEVISION AND SOME A PROMISE OF MONEY FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND WE SAW THAT GROW INTO A UNIVERSITY THAT EDUCATED STUDENTS AND WE REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO HAVE THE UNIVERSITY IN THEIR BACKYARDS. SO THAT THEY KNEW SO THAT YOURS YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN FRESNO AS WELL KNEW THAT THAT UNIVERSITY WAS BUILT FOR THEM AND THAT WE HAD DREAMS AND EXPECTATIONS. THAT THEY WOULD DO WELL IN THAT THEY WOULD DO SUCCESSFUL AND OUR GOAL AT THAT TIME WAS TO BRING THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SHE IS C. MERCED WITH THE IDEA THAT. THAT THAT SCHOOL WOULD PARTNER WITH CSU FRESNO AND UC DAVIS SAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE CURRICULUM THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AT UC DAVIS. AND THEN THE STUDENTS WOULD THEN DO THEIR INTERNSHIPS AND RESIDENCIES HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND FRESNO MERCED MADERA COUNTIES. WHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK IN OUR HEALTH CLINICS AND HOSPITALS? WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD THEN STAY HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT FOR YEARS WE HAVE HAD SHORTAGES. OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS NOT JUST PHYSICIANS BUT WHEN YOU START EDUCATING PHYSICIANS YOU ALSO BRING ALONG NURSES PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND ALL OF THE OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT ARE NEEDED. SO THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HERE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE WE SAW THE ECONOMY DECLINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WITH THE HOUSING SHORTAGE BUT THINGS HAVE RETURNED TO NORMAL. WE HAVE SEEN THE STATE IN A MUCH BETTER STATE THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO RE FOCUS OUR ENERGIES AGAIN TO BRINGING THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS HERE. AND EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE RIGHT HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THAT THEY WILL BE THE FUTURE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SO I THINK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND AGAIN THIS IS A VERY TIMELY AND IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I PROMISE IS NOT GONNA BE TALKING HEADS APPEAR WE GO WE REALLY COME HERE TO HEAR YOU.

I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING DR MARK GALLI THE NEW HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY APPOINTED BY GAVIN A GOVERNING NEWSOME JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SIT DOWN IN THE OFFICE ARTICLES RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AS WE WERE GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND SHARING KIND OF OUR BACKGROUND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE WITH DYLAN AND I SAID HEY I GOT A HEARING COMING UP. IN JULY IN FRESNO. ANY CAME ANYWAY RIGHT. BOB FRESNO BEFRUGAL ISN'T EASY TO GET TO CENTER TOGGLE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU. SO JUST SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHO DODD THE GALLEY AS HE IS IN CHARGE OF THE LARGEST. AGENCY IN THE STATE. HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING THE GOVERNOR IMPLEMENT HIS VISION OF HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND NOT. TO YOU KNOW. MAKE LIGHT OF IT HE ALSO HAPPENS TO HAVE A MEDICAL DEGREE FROM HARVARD CELL. WHICH SHOP IN HIGH COTTON TODAY -- I AT APPRECIATE YOU COMING WE WANTED -- TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NOT ONLY HIM TO SHARE IN THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE WILL HAPPEN HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU. BUT THE ALSO -- OPEN THIS UP AND LAUNCH US OUT WITH SOME REMARKS AND THOUGHTS YOU HAVE. REALLY ABOUT -- THE THE FOCUS OF THE WORK OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE TODAY IN TERMS OF THE SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE STATE -- AND SO WITH THAT. I'D LIKE YOU TO KICK US OFF AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL ONE THANK YOU -- FRESNO FOR WELCOMING ME IT -- AND TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE -- IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE -- YOU IT IS GOING TO BE A FULL DAY FOR ME AFTER THIS SELECT HEARING NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO VISIT SOME OF THE FACILITIES IN THE FRESNO AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREA. AND REALLY TAKE A CHANCE -- TO NOT JUST IMAGINE AND LISTENED TO TO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BUT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THE PATIENTS THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR THEM AND WITH THEM -- AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER HOW WE AT THE AGENCY THAT SENATOR MITCHELL DESCRIBED TO HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO AGAIN I'M DOCTOR MARK ALLEY I'M THE NEW HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY FOR CALIFORNIA. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A PEDIATRICIAN -- WHO UP UNTIL JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS IN CLINICS IN A SAFETY NET HOSPITAL IN -- LOS ANGELES TAKING CARE OF LOTS OF PEOPLE AND FAMILIES WHO BENEFIT FROM MEDICAID IN THE PROGRAMS THAT TODAY I HAVE A CHANCE TO OVERSEE. IN WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE TOPIC OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE THE THOUGHT OF HOW DO WE REALLY DEVELOPED THE WORK FORCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOW WE ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT DRIVE SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG CHILDREN TOO BAD HEALTH DOWN THE ROAD -- I CAN'T HELP. BUT THINK ABOUT -- THE CARE OF THE FAMILY. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE FOCUS ON KIDS AND IT'S EASY FOR ME TO FOCUS ON IT AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND SPENDING A CAREER A SENSUALLY TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN. I'VE YET TO MEET A CHILD WHO REALLY STRUGGLES WITH HEALTH. AND ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME CHILDREN WHO STRUGGLE WITH HEALTH WHO ALSO DON'T HAVE SICK PARENTS. GRANDPARENTS WHO REALLY HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF THEMSELVES ACCESSING CARE. SO I WOULD JUST REMIND US THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE CARE OF CHILDREN HOW IMPORTANT AND VITAL IT IS FOR US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. THE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES AND IT GOES WAY BEYOND WHAT WE DO IN THE FOUR WALLS OF A CLINIC. RIDE THE DRIVERS OF HEALTH. DON'T START THE DAY YOU COME IN FOR YOUR FIRST WELL CHILD CHECK CERTAINLY WE DECLARE VICTORY WHEN WE GET ALL OF OUR KIDS THE IMMUNIZATIONS THEY NEED. TO BUT VERY FEW OF THE KIDS THAT I SEE WHO SUFFER FROM -- THE SOCIAL MANIFESTATIONS OF OR THE MEDICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY OUR DINER HAVING PROBLEMS FROM THE LACK OF IMMUNIZATION. IT'S THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TODAY. IT'S ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CENTRAL THE CENTRAL VALLEY FACES -- CONTAMINATED WATER AT A RATE GREATER THAN ANY OTHER PART OF OUR STATE. THE FACT THAT A QUARTER OF THE NATION'S FOOD COMES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT WERE ONE THE THE THIRD MOST FOOD INSECURE REGIONS. IN THE NATION -- IS A SHAME AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK THROUGH NOT JUST THE TWELVE DEPARTMENTS THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO LEAD EVERYTHING FROM SOCIAL SERVICES. TO DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO SENIOR SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES. TO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT ON THOSE THINGS BUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE WATER ISSUES THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES. NOT JUST IN THE BIG URBAN CENTERS WHERE WE ARE HAPPENED TO FLY IN AND OUT OF ALL THE TIME BUT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF DRIVING ACROSS THIS MORNING. AND COMING HERE TODAY. I WILL TELL YOU ON HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE IT IS -- AS A AS UCSF RESIDENT -- ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF COMING TO FRESNO -- AND HELPING CARE FOR SOME KIDS IN THE CLINICS HERE AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS PLACE WITH GREAT. RICHNESS IN P. ALL AND CALIFORNIA. OUR BIGGEST ASSET OUR OUR OUR PEOPLE. AND THE FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE A DECADE AND A HALF LATER SOME REAL PLANS ON HOW TO BUILD THIS HEALTHCARE RESOURCES RESOURCE NOT JUST WITH. MORE DOCTORS AND MORE NURSES WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY NEED BUT BUILDING UP WHAT I WOULD SAY ARE THE HEALTH COMMUNITY PROFESSIONALS OUR PROMISE FOR US THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR WAY AROUND. WHO DON'T DRIVE TO WORK BUT WALK TO WORK AND THEY KNOW THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A WAY? I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE OUR GOVERNOR ON DISCOVERING ALL OF THE GREAT WORK FOR US INVESTMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT WE CAN REALLY TAKE ON IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS NOT JUST IN THE HEALTH SPACE BUT IN THE MENTAL SPACE I DON'T WANT US TO FORGET. THAT. SO MANY INDIVIDUALS AND CHILDREN -- WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF BY GUARDIANS FOSTER PARENTS -- ADOPTIVE PARENTS BIOLOGICAL PARENTS AUNTS AND UNCLES OF WHALERS AND GRANDPARENTS ALL OVER THAT -- THAT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES REALLY WEIGH HEAVY ON THE KIDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND HOW DO WE NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. BUT THAT MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND I THINK THIS IS A SPACE WHERE OUR EFFORTS AROUND FROM A TAURUS AND COMMUNITY PROFESSIONALS REALLY NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP. I'M I WILL END WITH A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS -- THE GOVERNOR HAD A VERY HEALTHY HAVE THE BUDGET AND IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO BE PART OF IT. NOT ONLY DID WE MAKE GREAT INVESTMENTS AND NEW EFFORTS LIKE LOOKING AT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS IN OUR PEDIATRIC PRACTICES AND WORKING ON TRAINING AND SUPPORTING THOSE PEDIATRICIANS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER PROVIDERS. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ASSESS AND ADDRESS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS WE INVEST STOOD IN MEDICAID RATES ACROSS THE STATE BUT WE ALSO MADE A GREAT INVESTMENT AND WORK FORCE AND PAYING OFF PEOPLE'S. LOANS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO WORK IN UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES WITH HUGE UNDER ADDRESS NEEDS AND IN OUR FRESNO. OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE AWARDED ALMOST FORTY JUST SHY FORTY THIRTY NINE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE WORKING FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. LOAN REPAYMENTS OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO HELP THEM STAY COMMITTED FOR THIS REGION. AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO PAY OFF THOSE MEGA LOANS THAT THEY TOOK ON TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK IN. LOW INCOME UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES ON THE DENTAL SIDE WE AWARDED ACROSS THE STATE FORTY DENTISTS. LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TEN SO A QUARTER OF THE DENTISTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT RECEIVE THIS AWARD LIVE AND WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A SMALL STEP A VERY IMPORTANT STEP. BUT SOMETHING TO BUILD ON AND I THINK THE THEME IS CALIFORNIA HAS A TON TO BUILD ON AND ALTHOUGH THEIR AMBITIOUS AND WONDERFUL INITIATIVES WE'RE NOT STARTING FROM. ZERO YOU ALL HAVE BEEN PART OF A MOVEMENT. TO SAY WE DESERVE BETTER WE CAN DO BETTER AND I'M JUST PRIVILEGED TO BE HERE IN THE SEAT TO LISTEN AND LEARN FROM YOU THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO SENATOR MITCHELL AND ALL OF YOU ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE INVITATION. IT WAS A NO BRAINER IT WAS A QUESTION OF DO I FLY OR DRIVE AND IT WAS A GREAT DRIVE AND IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE YOU. IN I. ONE ECHO THAT WE HAVE TO TIP OUR HATS -- TO THIS GOVERNOR WHO'S MADE IT VERY. CLEAR EARLY IMPRESSION ON ALL OF US AND HOPEFULLY ON YOU AS WELL IN TERMS OF HIS COMMITMENT. TO CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS -- VERTICALLY IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE SO THANK YOU. I WOULD REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH YOU KNOW THIS IS HEARING NUMBER TWO OF SIX WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TOP BUT ALL THOSE ADDITIONAL ISSUES. AND PLEASE TRUST WE'RE GONNA GET THERE. A LANDSCAPE OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF MIKE TO DIVIDE UP OUR FIRST PANEL. AS THE APPROACH I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR PALACE NOW THAT WE'VE GOT A TIME KEEPER WHERE'S THE TIME KEEPER WAY OUT THERE SHE IS -- THEY'RE GONNA HOLD SIGNS UP TO SIGNAL BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE LEFT FROM. ONE MINUTE TO THIRTY SECONDS. TO ZERO AND IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN -- SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING YOU ALL KNOW THAT I KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE TRAINS RUNNING ON TIME -- AND SO WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO THE TIME FRAME -- BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THE TOM COMMIT FOR THE HEARING BUT WE ALLOW ENOUGH TIME AT THE END OF THE HEARING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. ON OUR FIRST PANEL -- WE HAVE DOCTOR JANET KAUFMAN IS A PROFESSOR AT UC SAN FRANCISCO DOCTOR COPPENS BETUL D. AS ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SHE'S I THINK NUMEROUS ARTICLES ON THE TOPIC. WAS A CONSULTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION. ALSO JOINING US IS DOCTOR CATHLEEN FLOORS DOCTOR FLORES WAS BORN INTO AN EVER GET MEXICAN FAMILY RESIDING RIGHT HERE IN FRESNO. AND WORKED AS A MIGRANT FARM WORKER FOR FIRST SIXTEEN YEARS OF LIFE. HE'S AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UC SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE UCSF BREZNO LATINO CENTER FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION RESEARCH. AND FINALLY BACK TO CARLA -- YOU DIRECTOR OF THE PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM AT VALLEY CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE DR YOUNG IS BOARD CERTIFIED. AND PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROL LOGY ARE TOO YOUNG IS WIDELY PUBLISHED AS WELL. WE'VE GOT BETH -- THEIR FULL BIOS I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THEM. SERVICE FOR WHAT THEIR TRUE BACKGROUND IN AND THE SIGNIFICANT IS SIGNIFICANT SISTER THIS TODAY'S CONVERSATION BUT YOU'VE GOT THEIR FULL BIOS AVAILABLE IN YOUR PACKETS WE'RE GONNA START WITH DOCTOR KAUFMAN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HIT THE MIKE SEE THE BUTTON RIGHT YOU GO OKAY WELL JUST GRASS YES SENATOR MITCHELL'S WILL CLOSE MEMBROS DEALER COMMITTEE SECRETARY GUY IT. WOULD LARA OPPORTUNITY DODD OF LARA KWAN WAS STATUS AWAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SECRETARY GOD FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. I TODAY OUR I THINK MY ROLE HERE IS TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OVERVIEW ON SOME OF THE WORK FORCE CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE VALLEY I'M GONNA FOCUS ON PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE ARE. TO THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE GREATEST CHALLENGES WE CERTAINLY HAVE CHALLENGES EVERY AREAS BUT THESE ARE TWO OF THE GREATEST SO WHEN THE INTEREST OF TIME WILL FOCUS THEIR OUR SERVER FIVE KEY POINTS ON THE CHALLENGES WE FACE FIRST OUR PRIMARY CARE IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY ACROSS THE STATE THE DISTRIBUTION IS QUITE POOR AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE SLIDES ABOUT THAT. A SECOND SOME PRIMARY KERR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DO NOT ACCEPT MEDICAID PATIENTS WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THAT IS CHANGING AS THE STATE HAS INCREASED MEDIC COW RATES. BUT IT IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN IN PLACES LIKE THE VALLEY WHERE A LARGE PART OF OUR POPULATION IS IN POVERTY AND ON MEDICARE NOW -- SECONDLY A THIRD MANY PRIMARY KERR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA ARE AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT AGE -- WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THEM AND THE FORECASTS THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES AT UCSF HAVE DONE. SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF NEW PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO REPLACE THOSE WHO RETIRE AND LESS THE STATE AXE PROACTIVELY. TO EXPAND THEIR NUMBERS AND INDEED I THINK THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR MADE A GOOD DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT INVESTMENT BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO DO. AND THEN FINALLY PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE NOT AS RACIALLY ETHNICALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA. AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY LOOK MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA. OKAY SO JUST A FEW -- GRAPHS HERE LOOKING AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE MAJOR REGIONS OF THE STATE -- AND THESE ARE ACTIVE PATIENT CARE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION NOW WHY DO WE DO A RATIO PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION WELL THAT ENABLES US TO MAKE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS ACROSS REGIONS OF WE JUST LOOKED AT RAW NUMBERS. WE SEE THAT LA HAS MORE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WELL LOS ANGELES HAS MORE PEOPLE MORE FREEWAYS. MORE CARS PROBABLY MORE STARBUCKS THAN ANY PLACE AND IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT JUST DOESN'T HELP WAS PUTTING HIM ON A HUNT PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SCALE. MAKES MEANINGFUL COMP -- COMPARISONS AND SO WHAT WE SEE HERE. CALIFORNIA OVERALL HAS FIFTY SEVEN ACTIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ONLY FORTY FIVE SO WE'RE BEHIND THE STATE. AND THEN IF WE LOOK HERE AT PSYCHIATRY THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE BLEAK CALIFORNIA OVERALL HAS FIFTEEN PSYCHIATRIST PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS ONLY SEVEN LESS THAN HALF. OF MOVING TO MEDIC COW THIS GRAPH PERCENTS. SOME WORK THAT -- OUR I COLLEAGUES AND I DID FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND L. WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT AT THAT TIME 64%. OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA HAD ANY MEDIC HOW PATIENTS IN THEIR PRACTICE SO THIS ISN'T WERE THEY WILLING TO ACCEPT NEW OR NOT THIS DID THEY HAD EVEN ANY EXISTING. MEDIC HOW PATIENTS IN THEIR PRACTICE AND ONLY 64% DID SO AGAIN -- THIS IS A CONCERN FOR AREAS OF THE STATE WITH A HIGH PROPORTION THE POPULATION MEDIC HAL AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL I THAT THE INCREASES IN MEDICAL PAYMENT WILL RESULT IN MORE DOCTORS SERVING MEDI CAL PATIENTS. I'M RACE ETHNICITY HERE APPLAUDED DATA FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN ON RECENT GRADUATES OF M. D. D. O. THAT'S OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIAN. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT NURSE PRACTITIONER AND ARE IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS BY RACE ETHNICITY AND AGAIN WHAT WE SEE THEY DO NOT MATCH THE POPULATION I GOT THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA OVER ON THE RIGHT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE POPULATION AND WE LOOK OVER AT THESE -- FIVE PROFESSIONS THERE ARE. THERE'S UNDER REPRESENTATION FOR ALL NOW CURIOUSLY IF WE LOOK AT SOME OTHER FIELDS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR JACQUELINE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND EVEN PRIMARY CARE WOULD BE SOCIAL. SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE GREAT ROLES TO PLAY IN COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THEY CAN ALSO BE VALUABLE IN PRIMARY CARE IN HELPING FOLKS. GET THE FULL RANGE OF OF SERVICES THEY NEED TO BE AS HEALTHY AS THEY CAN TO ADDRESS THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS AS WELL AS A MEDICAL AND THAT'S A FIELD WHERE FOR LATINOS IN AND FOR OTHER CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FOR LATINOS WE SEE A MUCH HIGHER REPRESENTATION SO I THINK ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS. ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS HOW CAN WE GET THESE MORE CLINICAL PROFESSIONS TO LOOK MORE LIKE SOCIAL WORK. OKAY TWO MINUTES I'VE GOT A SPEEDED UP. I'M SO JUST THIS SLIDE I WON'T GO INTO DEPTH WITH THIS IS A TYPOLOGY OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS TO SORT OF YOU CAN KIND OF THINK ABOUT OF A WAY TO KIND OF CATEGORIZE THE DIFFERENT. STRATEGIES YOU MIGHT PURSUE SO FIRST IS ENHANCED THE PIPELINE GROW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PURSUING HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION AND FOCUS ON IN RECRUITING. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST INTERESTED MOST PASSION ABOUT SERVING UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND PREPARE THEM TO DO THAT. UP RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF PROGRAMS OF THINGS LIKE LONGER PAYMENT STRATEGIES TO TAKE OUR PHYSICIANS NURSES OTHERS WHO WERE RICHARD COMING OUT OF TRAINING AND GET THEM TO PRACTICE IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED GET THEM TO THE CARE. FOR CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF MAXIMIZING THE EXISTING REPORTS TAKING STEP BACK AND SAY MORE WE USE THE EXISTING WORKFORCE. MORE EFFICIENTLY MORE EFFECTIVELY WE CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE TODAY MENTION CHROMODORIS AND THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE TYPE OF A HEALTH WORKER THAT WE COULD EXECUTE UTILIZE MORE EXTENSIVELY -- FINALLY LEVERAGING DATA I MEAN THIS IS ADMITTEDLY A LITTLE SELF SERVING I'M AN ACADEMIC BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST THAT. IS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE DATA SYSTEMS IN PLACE IN OUR STATE. TO ENABLE -- THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND AND THE SECRETARY AND OTHERS TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN THE HEALTH WORKFORCE AND OUR GROUP AT UCSF WILL HAVE A PAPER COMING OUT IN A FEW WEEKS LAYING OUT WHAT WE SEE IS AN IDEAL SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA. I'M I'M NOT GONNA TALK MUCH ABOUT THE STATE BUDGET ITEMS BECAUSE OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT BUT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE A GOOD A DOWN PAYMENT. AND THEN SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHERE WE MIGHT. GO BEYOND THIS IN TERMS OF X. THE EXISTING WORKFORCE THERE'S LEGISLATION PENDING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE NURSE PRACTITIONERS FOR PRACTICE. A STORY THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T THE ONLY THING WE COULD DO BUT IT IS ONE THING THAT TAKES LEGISLATIVE ACTION. MOST STATES NURSE PRACTITIONERS CAN BRIBE CAN PRACTICE. WITHOUT SUPERVISION AND THERE'S VERY STRONG ROBUST BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN DO THIS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND WILL STOP THERE AND OR DO YOU ONLY CAN [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. OKAY WELL WELL WELL. WILL STOP THEIR OWNERS PRACTICES SAFELY EFFECTIVELY AND THOSE STATES THAT HAVE FULL PRACTICE OF FORTY TEND YOU'RE MORE FOLKS ARE ENTERING THE FIELD. AND THERE'S BETTER ACCESS TO CARE SO THE LAST THREE REALLY QUICKLY INCREASE FUNDING FOR PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER EDUCATION PROGRAMS THERE CERTAINLY SOME MONEY FOR THIS IN THE BUDGET BUT IT'S NOT ON THE SCALE OF THE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE. SO I REALLY THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THE NEED AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE INVESTMENT THEIR RELATIVE TO PRIMARY CARE -- PROVIDING FUNDS FOR TARGET INCREASES IN A MOMENT A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOOLS. OF THE FORTY FIVE TO THE FORTY FIVE STATES HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE FEW THE SMALL STICK JUST DON'T HAVE A FORTY FIVE STATES HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY THIRD. FORTY THIRD IN THE RATIO OF MEDICAL STUDENTS TO POPULATION. SO OUR YOUNG CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INTEREST IN BECOMING PHYSICIANS HAVE FAR FEWER OPPORTUNITIES THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN MOST OTHER STATES. OF AND I WOULD COME INTO THE REPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THAT HAS. SIX SEPARATE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE PURSUED TO INCREASE. ENROLLMENT AND USE THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SO I THINK. THOSE ARE ALL WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT AND THEN LASTLY INVESTING IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION PIPELINE. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE HEALTH WORKFORCE TO LOOK MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA UNLESS WE INVEST IN THE PIPELINE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS PARTICULARLY TO INVEST IN THE PIPELINE AT THE COLLEGE AND POST BACCALAUREATE LEVEL. THESE ARE OUR YOUNG LATINO ALL SOUTHEAST ASIAN AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO TO GET THEMSELVES INTO COLLEGE AND IN SOME PLACES HAVE DONE. EVERYTHING WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO IN TERMS OF THE PREREQUISITE COURSES AND THE TESTS AT THAT YOU NEED FOR ADMISSION TO HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOL. AND THIS IS THAT ADDED ACADEMIC SOCIAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO HELP THEM GO THAT LAST MILE TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. AND WITH THAT I'LL STOP AND I THINK WE TURN IT OVER TO DR FLORES [INAUDIBLE] TO MIKE. OKAY NETWORKS -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO FRESNO IT REALLY DOES MEAN A LOT TO ALL OF US IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SPEAK TO YOU HERE THAN HAVING UP TO SACRAMENTO SO. HE WHICH HAS GOT HIS PRODUCT UP UNTIL SKINNER SCANDINAVIA LUCKY CONSIDER SAUDA. ON SAME LITTLE WHAT WE'LL SECOND WHETHER A PERSON. ON A SECOND MINI THAT. SO -- I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW JANET COUGH DR KAUFMAN AND THE REASON I LEFT TO FOLLOW DR KAUFFMAN IS BECAUSE IT FITS RIGHT INTO WHAT MY REMARKS ARE FOCUSED ON MY REMARKS ARE FOCUSED ON INCREASING -- THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE AND WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH FITS THIS PARTICULAR -- CONVERSATION SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME AND WHY I'M DOING WHAT I'M DOING AS WAS MENTIONED I DOES COME FROM I DO COME FROM AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY -- AND I WAS A FARM WORKER -- FOR THE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE SO I'VE LIVED. WHAT MANY OF MY PATIENTS AND MANY OF THE MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT I WORK WITH HAVE LIVED THROUGH AND CONTINUE TO LOOK THROUGH AS IMMIGRANT TOM? FAMILIES. HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE -- INEVITABLY. WE FACED MANY INEQUITIES IN HEALTHCARE -- I SAW WITHIN MY OWN PERSONAL FAMILY -- TRAGEDIES THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD WE NOT LIVED IN LABOR CAMPS HAD WE NOT LIVED IN CARS HAVE BEEN NOT LIVED IN TENTS. ON THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN -- HANDLED BETTER BY THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS THAT TOOK CARE OF MY FAMILY HAD THEY RECOGNIZED UNDERSTOOD WHERE WE CAME FROM WHAT OUR RESOURCES WERE AND THEY WOULD HAVE OFFERED OTHER TYPES OF REMEDIES IF YOU WILL -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME INTO HEALTHCARE. I BECAME A FAMILY PHYSICIAN IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I WANTED TO PROVIDE. PRIMARY CARE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY BUT BEYOND THE FAMILY THE COMMUNITY TAKING CARE OF A ONE PERSON IS IMPORTANT TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY IS IMPORTANT BUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TAKING CARE OF THE COMMUNITY AND UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITY FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM -- I THEN BECAME A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND THE REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE HAVING GONE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND NOT HAVING ANY MENTORS AND ROLE MODELS -- IT WAS A CUTE FOR ME TO GIVE BACK TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE -- TO HELP THEM NOT STRUGGLE THE WAY THAT I STRUGGLED AS I WENT THROUGH UNDERGRAD AND THEN COLLEGE -- MEDICAL SCHOOL -- AND EVEN RESIDENCY PROGRAM RESIDENCY TRAINING. SO BECAUSE OF THAT -- BACKGROUND -- WE FOUNDED THE A DOCTOR'S ACADEMY -- IT'S AT THE UCSF RESIDENT AT THE IN A CENTER FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE AND HONOR OF BEING THE DIRECTOR OF THAT PROGRAM. AND WE WORK -- WITH YOUNG PEOPLE STARTING IN SEVENTH GRADE ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR ALUMNI WHO ARE ALREADY IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. ON BECAUSE OUR MISSION IS TO INCREASE THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND THE LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY OF THE PROVIDERS THAT SERVE US HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ON THE IDEA WAS TO GROW OUR OWN -- WE WORK WITH THE DISADVANTAGED FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO HIGHER EDUCATION LEGACY -- WE WORK TO DEVELOP A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE TO HELP KIDS -- DEVELOP THAT SELF EFFICACY THE BELIEF IN THEMSELVES THAT THEY NEED AND ALSO TO WORK WITH THEIR PARENTS ON TO HELP THEM BELIEVE THAT THE KIDS REALLY COULD SUCCEED. AND IN ADDITION WORKING WITH THE TEACHERS TO SEE THAT THESE KIDS DESPITE WHERE THEY COME FROM DESPITE WHAT THEIR BACKGROUNDS ARE THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL -- WE ALSO WANT TO HELP OUR KIDS NOT JUST BE SUCCESSFUL BY PROVIDING MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES IN ACADEMIC SUPPORT. AND HEALTH MENTOR -- ADD CONTACTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY -- TO REMIND THEM TO HOLD ON TO WHERE THEY COME FROM HOLD ON TO THEIR CULTURES AND THEIR LANGUAGES SO THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO THE VALLEY AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE PROVIDES A BUNCH A TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC SUPPORT ENRICHMENT HEALTH CREEKS BOWSHER WE HAVE WORKED WITH OVER FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS TO DATE -- A HAVE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND A 100% OF THEM HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED INTO HEALTH. INTO. FOUR YEAR COLLEGES. WE SEEK TO EMPOWER THEM TO EMPOWER THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER TO BECOME A PHYSICIAN ALTHOUGH THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEY BECOME SUCCESSFUL -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THAT THEY RETURN AND PROVIDE SERVICE. IN OUR WORKFORCE COMMISSION ON THE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DOCTOR COFFIN ALLUDED TO THIS WAS TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR HEALTH HALFWAY PROGRAMMING. AND THAT INCLUDES HEALTH PATHWAY PROGRAMS AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOLS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T EXPOSE KIDS TO WHAT THEY CAN BE EARLY ON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN DO IT. BUT BEYOND JUST EXPOSURE YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM THAT ACADEMIC SUPPORT BECAUSE TO GIVE A MCCARRON SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO BUT NOT PROVIDE THAT MEET. OF WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THAT -- THAT ACADEMIC JOURNEY ON SUCCESSFUL WERE NOT REALLY HELPING THEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN. IN ADDITION WE SO SUPPORTING THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS AND THERE ARE MANY INCLUDING IN ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS -- THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE ALSO ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THE H. COP PROGRAMS WHICH ARE THE HEALTH KERR OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY AT OUR ALLEN ST COLLEGE IS THAT WE ENCOURAGE THAT THAT BE EXPANDED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES THOSE PROGRAMS DO BASICALLY WITH THE DOCTORS ACADEMY DOES HERE IN FRESNO WHICH IS AGAIN PROVIDE IN RICHMOND ACADEMICALLY BUT ALSO. EXPOSURE -- AND THEN HELP THE STUDENTS FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO APPLY AND GET INTO THEIR HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS -- THOSE WE DO HAVE SEVERAL PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT ARE VERY VERY -- PROMISING BUT WE NEED FUNDING TO EXPAND THAT TO OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OTHER COLLEGE CAMPUSES. ULTIMATELY THE PROGRAMS THAT I'M DESCRIBING WILL LEAD TO MORE CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE. STUDIES ARE VERY CLEAR THAT UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY PROVIDERS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE CARE TO PATIENTS WHO COME FROM -- DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS PATIENTS WHO HAVE MEDICARE MEDICAID I'LL ON AND SO IT'S VERY CRITICAL AGAIN THAT WE GROW OUR OWN SET WE ASSURE THAT OUR PATIENTS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CARE -- WITH THE INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE -- SO I'LL END BY JUST REMINDING US AND REMINDING OUR VISITORS -- THAT GROWING OUR OWN IS A CONCEPT THAT WORKS IT'S PROVEN -- WE JUST NEED MORE FUNDING AND WE NEED TO MAKE MORE STRATEGIC AND BRINGING THAT -- TOGETHER SO THAT RATHER THAN HAVING SPOT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE COORDINATION COLLABORATION AND THAT -- WE'VE BASICALLY LEARN BEST PRACTICES AND SHARE THOSE ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH [INAUDIBLE] DR YOUNG. THE MORNING HANDS I WANT TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I MET AGAIN FROM DIFFERENT OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL MEETINGS. AND I'M NEW ORDER FRESNO BUT I HAVE TO SAY JUST LIKE EVERYONE SAID FRESNO'S ON THE BEST PLACES TO LIVE AND I'M I'M A BELIEVER SO I WON'T BE. I'LL BE STAYING HERE FOR A LONG TIME. I WANNA THANK YOU -- DOCTOR MITCHELL AND OUR SORRY STARTED TELLING SENATOR DOLE AND SENATOR DODD OF FOR FOR INVITING ME AND ALSO THE OTHERS LET COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- IS KIND OF FITTING THAT I'M THE LAST PERSON TO SPEAK BECAUSE I'M GOING TO TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A GRANULAR LEVEL. I WAS FORTUNATE TO BECOME OF THE VALLEY CHILDREN'S PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND I CAME HERE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN AT JOHNS HOPKINS PRIOR TO THAT -- BALTIMORE HAS ITS OWN UNDERSERVED POPULATION IN. COMING HERE THE THE THING THAT I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED IS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE REALLY DOES WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK THIS A GREAT EXAMPLE IN THE ROOM IS PACKED. VALLEY CHILDREN'S AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WAS -- BORN OUT OF THE VISION OF FIVE WOMEN OF THE VALLEY WHO. DECIDED THAT A PEDIATRIC HOSPITALS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. OVER SIXTY YEARS AGO. AND RIGHT NOW OUR MEDICARE POPULATION RATE WRITES ABOUT 80% ACROSS OUR NETWORK -- SOME PLACES MORE THAN OTHERS AND IN ADDITION WE HAVE A NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAM THAT TRAINS THIRTEEN NEW PEDIATRIC DOCTORS EVERY YEAR. HOWEVER WE TRAIN UP TO TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTS PER YEAR FROM THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY FROM EVERY SPECIALTY INCLUDING. NURSE PRACTITIONERS FAMILY MEDICINE INTERNAL MEDI US ARE NOT INTERNAL MEDICINE EMERGENCY MEDICINE SURGEONS WITH ORTHOPEDIC AND GENERAL SURGEONS AND WE REALLY FOUND THAT AND FOR DISCIPLINARY TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE NURSES IN THE SOCIAL WORK AND TURNS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO COME TO VALLEY CHILDREN'S FOR TRAINING. TODAY I WANT TO DESCRIBE. HOW BUILDING A WORK FORCE IS A DIRE NEED THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT TENDING? BASED ON THE LITERATURE AND WHAT OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID WE WANT TO RECREATE THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE -- GOING TO LOOK LIKE OUR POPULATION BUT THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT -- HAVING RESIDENT ARE HAVING MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT COME INTO THEIR SCHOOLS THAT MATCH OUR POPULATION. ONE EXAMPLES LATINO POPULATION WORDS ABOUT 60% IN OUR AREA BUT ONLY ABOUT 15% OF OUR RESIDENTS CURRENTLY AREN'T FORTINO DESCENT. WHAT THE WAY WE TRIED -- TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IS BY. EMPHASIZING TO OUR RESIDENTS EVEN BEFORE THEY ARRIVE HOW COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY FOR US. WE'VE BEEN EXACTING IN OUR SELECTION PROCESS AND I WILL TELL YOU IT DOES IN FACT HOW EASY IT IS TO RECRUIT PEOPLE THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REALIZING -- HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO DO THIS WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OUR RESIDENTS ARE COMPLETELY ENGAGED? WE HAVE ABOUT I DON'T KNOW EIGHT PROGRAMS AT LEAST WHERE RESIDENTS HAVE REACHED OUT TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS AND OTHER EXPERTS. SO ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS IS A RESIDENT LET IT -- MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS I'M ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES HERE IN FRESNO. AND SHE HAS EIGHT STUDENTS ENROLLED SHE'S ONLY BEEN WITH US FOR TWO YEARS. WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE HE'S BEEN WORKING WITH THE PREMATURE US INTO DERA HAS CREATED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM TO ADDRESS OBESITY PROBLEM. FIND COULD PROVING HEALTH LITERACY WITH NUTRITION AND OBESITY WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT HAS SIX STUDENTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A TEACHING KITCHEN TO LEARN HOW TO TEACH THEMSELVES -- HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS AND INEXPENSIVE MEALS. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER GROUP THAT PUT ON A SYMPOSIUM FOR ABOUT THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND OTHER PROVIDERS FOR CHILDREN. IN THE ADOLESCENT INJURIES TO DISCUSS SOCIAL REPRINT ARE SORRY SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE ARE ALREADY CONNECTING THIS COMMUNITY AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE -- WE ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER CLASS STARTING THEIR PROGRAMS. I JUST BRAG ABOUT MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FAR RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. TOTALLY AGREE THAT THE FROM A TAURUS IS GONNA BE A BIG ASSET AND I WANT OUR RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. I'M GOING TO TELL THE STORY GIVE HER A LOT OF INFORMATION I JUST WANT TO TELL THE STORY BECAUSE I AM A PEDIATRIC GI DOCTOR ABOUT A YOUNG PERSON. TEENAGER WHO HAD. D. I. BLEEDING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BY THE TIME SHE ARRIVED TO THE CLINIC VISIT. HER LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE REALLY RESULTED IN AN ESCALATION OF HER CARE SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR MANY WEEKS BECAUSE OF IT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS VERY QUICKLY. AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS DISCHARGED THE INSURANCE PLAN DID NOT ALLOW HER TO GET HER MEDICATION SHE WAS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. THIS JUST SHOWS AGAIN HOW IMPORTANT ACCESS TO CARE IS BUT ALSO -- I THINK DR DALLY. MADE A POIGNANT -- POINT TO SAY THAT THE SENATE THE THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE FULL FAMILY WAS AFFECTED. AND LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE MEDICAL CONDITIONS UNTIL WE FIND ONE OF THE PARENTS HAS PASSED WAVE OTHER TITLES IN THE HOSPITAL AND THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT JUST AN OCCASIONAL OCCURRENCE. I ALSO WANT TO TELL THAT STORY BECAUSE COMPLEX CARE IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE VALLEY IT'S EASY FOR ME AS A PEDIATRICIAN TO EMPHASIZE THAT AND I TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. BUT WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THEM. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE WANT THE BEST DOCTORS. WE WANT THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO THE BEST INSTITUTIONS AND I KNOW FROM MY INSTITUTION WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO RECRUIT DOES BEST DOCTORS BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME. SO WE CAN GROW THEM FROM OUR OWN THAT'S IDEAL -- WE DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE YET BUT THERE WILL EVEN BE BETTER -- WHEN I SAY THE BEST THESE DOCTORS ARE TRAINING FOR MINIMUM SIX YEARS FOR PEDIATRIC SPECIALTIES AND FOR THE SURGEONS SINCE? SIX TO TEN YEARS. WE HAVE DOCTORS AT OUR INSTITUTION THAT ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THEY ARE -- MENTORING STUDENTS ALONG THE WAY MENTORING RESIDENCE AND I REALLY HAVE TO EMPHASIZE WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT THIS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THIS WORK FORCE THAT'S WORKING TOGETHER. IS WHAT WILL BE OUR BEST BET FOR RETENTION EVEN WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO GET DOCTORS MONEY I KNOW PEOPLE THINK WE ALWAYS WANT MONEY BUT ACTUALLY WHAT I'VE SEEN AND I CAN SPEAK TO IT FROM THE MILITARY WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY TO NOW. THAT IS NOT WHAT KEEPS DOCTORS DOING WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY. SO MY ASSESSMENT. IN CONCLUSION WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN INTELLIGENT AND DRIVEN PEDIATRIC WORKFORCE PROVIDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF OUR GREAT CENTRAL VALLEY. WE NEED MORE PIPELINE PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT AND SUPPORT THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS MANY OF THEM -- ARE ASKING FOR SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MENTORSHIP FOR TAKING A BOARD EXAM IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD SCORES YOU DON'T GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL -- BARRIERS ARE PRETTY SEVERE IN THE VALLEY. FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS WE NEED TO WE NEED CREATIVE PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT THEM THE PEDIATRICS I'M PART OF THE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY COMMITTEE OF ASSOCIATION PEDIATRIC PROGRAM DIRECTORS FOR THE NATION. AND ALL PROGRAMS IN PEDIATRICS ARE REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME DUE TO OUR CONCERNS A WORK LIFE BALANCE AND SALARIES SOMETIMES OF MEDICAL STUDENTS DON'T REALIZE HOW WONDERFUL IT IS. FOR PHYSICIANS IN ADDITION TO CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS TO TRACK THEM TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO STAY. I SUPPORT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER ACADEMIC RESOURCES AS WELL AS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND MENTORING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SUPPORTED. THE NEED IS NOW AND WE'RE READY TO VOLUNTEER AND BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I I APPRECIATE YOUR THOROUGHNESS THE FACT THAT YOU INCLUDED ACTUAL RECOMMENDATIONS -- IN YOUR PRESENTATION -- AS WELL AS YOUR APPEARANCE AT THE TIME FRAME I APPRECIATE THAT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND BACK TO GALLERY OF COURSE OF OUR FIRST PANEL [INAUDIBLE] DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU KNOW THERE'S TIMES I'VE ACTUALLY JUST WANNA. ACKNOWLEDGE HOW LUCKY I AM TO BE ON A PANEL WITH PEOPLE AND DR FLORES WAS A HUGE INSPIRATION FOR ME AND MENTORSHIP AND BEING THE FIRST LATINO MEDICAL DOCTOR WE'VE EVER ELECTED TO OUR STATE WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. IF PEOPLE LIKE DR FLOORS HAD NOT GIVEN. SOME OF US A CHANCE ALONG THE WAY SO I JUST WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO THE PANEL AND WHAT AN HONOR IT IS. TO TAKE PART WITH YOU -- YOU KNOW I I WANTED TO SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT GROWING OUR OWN. BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS THAT'S WHAT YOU DID WITH ME. AND I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE DOCTORS ACADEMY BECAUSE IT'S A PROGRAM I WORKED WITH YOU ON I'VE HAD SOME OF YOUR STUDENTS WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH ME IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND NOT ALL OF THEM I KNOW WILL BECOME DOCTORS BUT WILL BECOME A PART. OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE FAIR ENOUGH. SO I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH DR FLOORS ON HER DOCTORS ACADEMY. AND HAVE HAD STUDENTS WHO HAVE SHADOWED ME IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND I'VE WORKED SIDE BY SIDE WITH. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP IF I CAN OFFLINE HOPEFULLY WITH THE HELP OF MY SENATOR HERE. TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A BUDGETARY ASK WE CAN DO TO HELP TO SUPPORT THOSE PATHWAY PROGRAMS. THAT ARE LOOKING AT DOCTORS ACADEMIES AS WELL AS H. COP. AND I WOULD SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO FOLLOW UP AS WELL SINCE I HAVE THE FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE EVER IN OUR STATE. THE SECOND IN OUR NATION IN MY BACKYARD AND A FEW BLOCKS FROM MY HOME. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN EXTEND THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS WHO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE STUDENTS WHO ARE BLACK AND BROWN OR GO. AND A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PROVIDING THOSE PATHWAY OPPORTUNITIES WILL HELP US TO DIVERSIFY OUR WORK FORCE GOING FORWARD. SO I REALLY JUST WANTED. TO PUT A PIN IN THAT AND SEE IF WE COULD FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE PUTTING A BUDGET ASK IN FRONT OF THE UP ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY. BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT COULD DOCTOR LEMOND ABOUT NOT HAVING A MEDICAL SCHOOL YET BECAUSE IT'S COMING. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE WHO DON'T KNOW WE'VE WORKED HARD TO TRY TO BRING A MEDICAL SCHOOL BACK TO THE VALLEY. AND THIS SEPTEMBER WE WILL HAVE OUR FIRST COHORT OF STUDENTS STARTING AT UCSF WHO WILL BE TRAINED UP THERE. BUT CALM DOWN TO THE VALLEY AFTER THEIR FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO DO THE REMAINDER OF THEIR MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE IN FRESNO. THAT PATHWAY THAT ABILITY TEST. HAVE THEM SEE OUR PATIENTS WHEN THEY ARE MEDICAL STUDENTS. OFTENTIMES INSPIRES THEM TO WANT TO WORK WITH THAT PATIENT POPULATION FOR BOTH RESIDENCIES IN THEIR LIFE. I KNOW I MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR ME. WANTING TO PRACTICE IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THE ONE THAT I KEEP. BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IF I COULD. THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PRIME PROGRAMS. WHICH OFTENTIMES HAVE NOT BEEN SUPPORTED FOLEY. AND HAVE HELPED US TO DIVERSIFY JUST TWO DAYS AGO I WAS TALKING TO THE UC IRVINE PRIME STUDENTS. AS THEY CAME UP TO OUR CAPITAL TO DO SOME ADVOCACY. AND I WAS IMPRESSED AT THE QUALITY OF THE STUDENTS. AND THE DIVERSITY THAT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T SEE IN OUR WORK FORCE THAT I DID NOT SEE IN MY PRACTICE AS WELL. SO FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PRIME WOULD BE GREAT. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE BILL THAT WE WORKED ON LAST YEAR WITH WORK FORCE WITH INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE RESIDENTS. FOREIGN DOCTORS WHO HAVE BOTH CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC COMPETENCIES. WE PLACED FIFTY OF THOSE DOCTORS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT AND SCALE THOSE PROGRAMS. AS A BILL I HAD LAST YEAR DID WITH UCLA. BUT WE OFTEN TIMES STRUGGLE IN. HEALTH CARE IF WE DON'T FIRST EMBRACE EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND OUR GOVERNORS LEADERSHIP. IN INCREASING ACCESS TO ALL YOUNG ADULTS ALLOWS US TO START TAKING CARE OF FAMILIES AS WELL. AND WE HAVE TO BE THANKFUL AND APPRECIATIVE. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE GOVERNOR WHO CARES ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR ISSUES. AND I'M GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF THIS PANEL AND JUST THANK THE SELECT COMMITTEE AGAIN FOR THIS CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND DIVERSIFICATION. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FALL BY CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU M. THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION ALL OF THAT IS. REALLY CRITICAL FOR US MOVING FORWARD AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH POLICY BUT I HAVE A CURIOSITY AND I'M NOT SURE YOU'D BE ABLE. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW AS AN EDUCATOR -- I TRIED REALLY HARD TO TO INSPIRE MY STUDENTS TO GO IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF NO MEDICINE ANOTHER CAREER PATHS AND I KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WERE FACING. IS SOCIAL MEDIA. AND I FOUND THAT. INSTEAD OF INSPIRING OUR CHILDREN TO WESTERN DIRECTION IT KINDA DISCOURAGES THESE LONG CAREER PATHS OF FOR EXAMPLE I HEARD YOU SAY. THAT FOR SPECIALTY IN MEDICINE IS FROM SIX TO TEN YEARS AND SO OUR CHILDREN OR STUDENTS ARE HEARING HOW WE HAVE OVERNIGHT MILLIONAIRES BECAUSE READER BLOCKERS OR I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN. SOME KIND OF AREA OF EXPLORATION WHERE. WE CAN REACH THESE KIDS THAT ARE BEING BASICALLY RAISED BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND TRENDS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE CAREER PATHS IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THAT WE CAN DO. I CAN SHARE THAT TOM. WE IN OUR PATHWAY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND UTILIZING SOCIAL MEDIA NOT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT WITH THEIR HEARING FROM OTHERS BUT RATHER TO INSPIRE. ON THE W. M. C. ALSO IS USING SOCIAL MEDIA -- TO OUTREACH TO STUDENTS -- NOT NECESSARILY AT THE BILLY YOUNG AGES BUT CERTAINLY AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND BEYOND IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND TO GET THEM. TO HELP GUIDE THEM IN THE RIGHT PATH -- AND THERE ARE NATIONAL ARE W. J. I JUST CAME BACK FROM A SITE VISIT IN SEATTLE ARE W. J. -- FUNDS SHOULD HAVE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE KINDA LIKE H. COP PROGRAMS ONLY CONSOLIDATED DURING THE SUMMER. AND WE ALSO HAD A CONVERSATION -- JUST A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT UTILIZING SOCIAL MEDIA -- AT THE STUDENT LEVEL AND IN FACT WE ENGAGE THE STUDENTS IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING WRONG BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING IS WE THINK WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS. AS PROFESSIONALS IN DEVELOPING SOCIAL MEDIA BUT IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THE KIDS -- THAT WERE DIRECTING IT. TO IT MAY NOT BE NEARLY AS USEFUL SO I GUESS I'M LONG WINDED ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AT THE KIDS PLACE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM WHETHER IT BE. IN AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL OR THE COLLEGE LEVEL ON TO GIVE THEM THE REAL SCOOP AND ALSO TO TO THE JOURNEY IS LONG. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY -- SO MANY AVENUES TO GET THERE AND SO MANY LITTLE. THINGS WAYS YOU CAN GO OUT AND BACK -- THAT KIDS DON'T THINK ABOUT AND PART OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLUG IS. TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I JUST WANNA JUST ADD -- IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE I WOULD REALLY LOVE IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS FURTHER AND THE REASON I SAY THIS I KNOW THAT. AN ELEMENTARY LEVEL AND MANY SCHOOLS ARE DOING THIS NOW WERE WERE USING CODING AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM. SO NOW THEY'RE CREATING THESE PROGRAMS WHEN THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW EIGHT YEARS OLD NINE YEARS OLD AND I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE. THAT'S NOW PART OF THE CURRICULUM AND I THINK WE MAY BE. PUSHING OUR KIDS TO GO DOWN THAT THE DIRECTION OF OF PROGRAMMERS AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE CURRICULUM SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY. IN THE FUTURE THEY HAVE IDEAS WERE WE CAN BRIDGE. THAT GAP AND ALSO INCLUDES THESE TYPE OF A CAREERS EARLIER ON AT THE OPEN TO HEAR HIMSELF THINK KIA. USER TO GALGIANI THE QUESTION WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MOVE ALONG AT A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IN THE BUDGET -- SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE MCO DEAL WHERE WE RECEIVED ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE FIVE MILLION FOR THE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGETS IT'S SO WAS A TWO YEAR PLAN. AND IT WAS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR FORTY EIGHT NEW STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN MEDICAL EDUCATION THE PRIME PROGRAM SO SINCE THAT MONEY IS GONE NOW IF WE WERE TO REINVEST IN THAT THAT WOULD GIVE US. A GOOD BASIS TO MOVE FORWARD -- WE KNEW WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO BRING A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HE'S EVER SAID. THAT BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WE WOULD HAVE A STATEWIDE SHORTAGES SEVENTEEN THOUSAND POSITIONS IN THE STATE. AND NOW AT AROUND TWO THIRDS OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE SO WE ARE. ARE FACED WITH THE SILVER TSUNAMI OF ALL OF OUR PHYSICIANS RETIRING IF WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT GOING FORWARD SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN PRIME -- FOR BOTH FRESNO AND MERCED TO ADDRESS OUR STATEWIDE ISSUE. I THINK THAT -- AS WE AS THE STATE LOOKS AT PURSUING THE MCO TAX AND AND WE BEGIN OUR KIND OF PARKING LOT LIST OF OF ITEMS WE HOPE IT WILL FUND. WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF HOW THOSE DOLLARS WERE SPENT. DR RANDALL I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO HOLD ON TO YOUR QUESTION IS I'M GOING TO I'M DRIVING THE TRAIN AND I WANT TO GET OUR SECOND PANEL UP. AND THERE'S A QUESTION OR STATEMENT NO IT WAS MORE OF A THANK YOU TO DR. KELLY AND THE CALUMET WORK FORCE AS WELL AS THE CAL HEALTH CARE'S TWO NEW PROGRAMS YOU GOT UP AND RUNNING THIS YEAR THAT WE ARE HELP SO EXCELLENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT THE GALLEY LET ME JUST SAY VERY QUICKLY AS I LISTEN TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS AND WE RECOGNIZE WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE HASN'T DONE AREAS THAT WE WE STEPPED UP -- ONCE OUR OUR GENERAL FUND WAS BACK IN THE BLACK AND WE WERE NO LONGER BROKE. AND CUTTING PROGRAMS. THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN MAKING COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE. AND WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADDRESS MEDICAL SCHOOL DEBT. BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE POPULATIONS WE WANNA -- REACH OUT TO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A REALITY IN TERMS OF EVEN HOW YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND HOW YOU COULD AFFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE OTHER TWO QUICK COMMENTS I'M GONNA MAKE A MISSILE PUT HIM OUT THERE -- MODELING NECESSARILY EXPECT ANSWERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. YOU KNOW SYSTEMIC BIAS AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON POOR CHILDREN CHILDREN OF COLOR. YOU KNOW -- I WONDER WHAT ROLE PROP TWO OH NINE PLAYED IN IMPACTING MED SCHOOL DIVERSITY IN OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED MED SCHOOLS AS FEW AS THEY ARE -- BUT BUT WE DIDN'T HELP MATTERS WITH PROP. TWO OH NINE AS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE TO HEAR TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT IMPLICIT BIAS HOUSE ON THE HEALTHCARE. DELIVERY SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THOSE OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF OF WHAT MESSAGE WE SENT AS A STATE. ON WITH THE PASSAGE OF TWO OH NINE THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD WOULD DROP. IS. WITH REGARD TO THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL AND I WASN'T AWARE THIS IT WAS MY OWN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHO IS A UC DAVIS ALONE WHO BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION THE FORM OF A QUESTION. WHICH IS WHY THE UC SYSTEM AND AND AND YOUR HOSPITALS DON'T ACCEPT MEDICARE -- FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE HE SAYS YOU KNOW YOU'RE PUBLICLY FUNDED INSTITUTION AND YET IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE MEDICARE SYSTEM AND SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU ALL TO TO ANSWER THAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE JUST LAID OUT THERE. FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION -- BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE WE'VE A SYSTEM THAT MEETS ALL NEEDS AS WE ARE BEING ASKED TO PUT PUBLIC FUNDS INTO THE SYSTEM TO EXPAND -- THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND AND YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK WE IT WOULD BE FAIR TO EXPECT THAT THE UC STEP UP ALSO. IN TERMS OF BEING -- MEDI CAL PROVIDERS AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS FULL SCOPE I STILL HAVE MISSING TEETH FROM A BILL I. KERRY SCOPE OF WORK -- I HEAR YOU WHEN I GET IN THE MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. THERE TENDS TO BE A LITTLE COMPETITION -- AND SO I THINK -- I'VE HEARD THE BILL COMING I. I LOOK FOR TO US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE IN OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT THAT HEALTHCARE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS HIGH QUALITY YES ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE AND CERTAINLY EXPANDING THE WORK THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS -- DO MAKE PERFECT SENSE ANY FINAL QUICK COMMENTS BEFORE WE YES JUST LIKE OUR IMPLICIT BIAS -- QUESTION ABSOLUTELY PROP TO ATTEND HEY HUGE.

WITHOUT HITTING IN ONE WOMEN LEADING THE VALLEY WOMEN LEAVE THE VALLEY THAT MAKES YOU STAND THAT I WILL DO THAT ON MY TWITTER WOMEN LEAVE THE VALLEY. SO I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH I WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BUT THEIR IMPORTANCE IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED. IT HAS BEEN WELL OVER A DECADE SINCE LITERATURE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. BEGAN TO RISE IN PREVALENCE GLOBALLY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES AND DEATH IN FRESNO COUNTY CHILDREN ARE THREE POINT TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED. DUE TO PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS SUCH AS RESPIRATORY ILLNESS TOO MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCE DRIVING OUR CHILD TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO AS MY RELATED COMPLICATIONS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR OVER. TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- INGESTED FRESNO COUNTY ALONE. CHILDREN I'M IN OTHER REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOT SEEN -- QUITE THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND FRESNO AND WE KNOW THAT PARTLY THESE CONDITIONS ARE DUE TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE HOMES WHERE OUR CHILDREN LIVE. AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THESE HOMES ARE SITUATED WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN ISSUES OF MILDEW AND HOUSING PROXIMITY OF NEIGHBORHOODS TO ROADWAY TEN MAJOR ROADWAYS AND OTHER POLLUTING SOURCES. IT'S NOT A SECRET THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF HEAVY INDUSTRY USES IN FRESNO COUNTY AND PRESENT THE CITY OF FRESNO IS CLUSTERED IN WEST FRESNO HE WANTS RED LINE COMMUNITY THAT IS OUR TRADITIONAL HOME FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THEN IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES BECAME THE PLACE FOR MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WERE -- WERE. FORCED TO LIVE IN WE KNOW THAT AND CAL LARA WHICH WAS ALSO ONCE A RED LINE COMMUNITY BUT IT WAS THE OPPOSITE IT WAS PRIMARILY IT WAS AN ALL WHITE COMMUNITY. UP UNTIL THE CITY OF FRESNO STARTED TO ANNEX THE SURROUNDING LAND AND PURSES OWNED IT FOR HEAVY INDUSTRY USES AND SO OVER TIME WE SEE TODAY NOW HOW WAS HOME 280%. LATINO COMMUNITIES MOST -- COMMUNITIES ARE MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS. AND SO AS WE KNOW -- WHERE YOU LIVE WORK LEARN AND PLAY HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON NOT ONLY HOW YOU LIVE BUT HOW LONG YOU LIVE WE ALL KNOW THE FACT THAT WEST RESONANCE LIVE TWENTY YEARS LESS THAN THEIR NORTH FRESNO COUNTERPARTS? THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS IS BECAUSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INSERT. EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE ON CHILD HEALTH THREE COMPLEX INTERRELATED -- INTERRELATIONSHIP OF MORE DISTAL SOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS INCOME AND EDUCATION WITH MORE PROXIMAL FACTORS SUCH AS HEALTH BEHAVIORS WHICH ARE HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY YOUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WE KNOW THAT 52% OF RESIDENTS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO DO NOT LIVE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF A QUALITY PARK THEREFORE LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TED AND ENGAGE IN PLAY. AND EXERCISE AND AND OTHER HEALTH CONDUCIR BEHAVIORS WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY OUT DURING GREENSPACE OPPORTUNITIES DO BETTER IN MATH AND SCIENCE SO AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR HEALTH SECTOR WE'RE SETTING UP OUR CHILDREN TO FAIL. BUT JUST THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A QUALITY GREEN SPACE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE WAYS BY WHICH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS BEAR THEIR INFLUENCE OPERATE OVER TIME AND ACROSS GENERATIONS. CREATING GREATER DISPARITIES WITH EACH GENERATION THAT GOES BY. IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY IMMIGRANTS COME HERE FOR OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT THAT WE WANT TO SEE OUR CHILDREN SUCCEED AND UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEMS THAT WE SET UP IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE ACTUALLY CREATING THE OPPOSITE CONDITIONS THAT ENABLE ACTUALLY OUR CHILDREN. TO END UP IN PRISON YES YOU ARE THE SCHOOL TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IS REAL. 70% OF STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN IN SCHOOL ARRESTS ARE BLACK OR LATINO. KEEP THAT IN MIND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHY WE DON'T DO NOT HAVE FOLKS THAT LOOK LIKE GUYS TREATING US AT THE HOSPITAL EDUCATING US IN OUR SCHOOLS RIGHT SITTING ON PANEL SUCH AS THIS. ONE IS BECAUSE WE'RE BREAKING A PRIME INDICATOR OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND THAT SOCIAL COHESION. WERE FRAGMENTING THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO HAVE WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH THEIR COMMUNITY AND OVERALL WITH OUR SOCIETY. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WE KNOW THAT THERE PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED BY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DECISIONS WHICH ARE WELL BEYOND THE CONTROL OF PARENTS. AN INDIVIDUAL PEDIATRICIANS ARE PROVIDERS SOCIETIES WE CAN PROTECT CHILDREN AGAINST THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AT PRESENT A BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHICH WAS FOUNDED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND FRESNO TO FOSTER AND ENCOURAGE THRIVING COMMUNITIES WHERE ALL. AND WE MEAN ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES CAN LIVE HEALTHY SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT THIS FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND POLICIES THAT CONSTRAINT 38% OF CHILDREN IN FRESNO COUNTY. TO LIVE IN POVERTY. 38% OF OUR CHILDREN IN FRESNO COUNTY LIVE IN POVERTY. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE GOALS OF FRESNO BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME AS IN OUR COALITION -- BECAUSE THEY ARE BROUGHT THEIR COMPREHENSIVE AND THERE ARE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AMBITIOUS THEY SPAN A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT REFLECT AN UNDERLYING BELIEVE THAT SOCIETAL. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS ALL TOGETHER HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE. AND SO WE CALL IN OUR DECISION MAKERS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. ALL SYSTEMS WE CALL ON COMMUNITY LEADERS YOUTH AND ELDERS TO JOIN US AND ADDRESSING THE LONGSTANDING HISTORY OF RACISM IN OUR HOUSING POLICY. WE CAN START BY IMPLEMENTING RENTER PROTECTIONS ARE PROMOTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS WITH MONEY TO BACK IT. IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY THREE INCLUSIONARY ZONING AND ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES. BY PROMOTING AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE AND OUTDOOR RECREATION AND REQUIRING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARKS AND OTHER OUTDOOR SPACES AND HEALTHY PLACES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR WEST PRESENCE SHOULD NOT HAVE A REGIONAL PARK BUILT ON A LANDFILL. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE OUR CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER OUR CHILDREN DESERVE TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR EVEN THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE IN OUR COMMUNITY IS NOT EQUAL WE KNOW THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS THE WORST AIR NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE NATION. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR TREE CANOPY WHERE WE PROMOTE GREEN SPACE LIKE TREES THERE'S A HUGE STAFF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH FRESNO. AND SO TODAY I AM HERE WITH OUR PANELISTS TO INVITE ALL OF YOU TO CONTINUE TO ELIMINATE POVERTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY DIVERSE DEFINING OUR ECONOMY SO THERE WERE NO LONGER RELYING. ON INDUSTRIES THAT EXPLOIT THE LABOR OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT IN FACT VALUE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE EACH ME. AND VALUE ARE INHERENT IN A HUMAN VALUE JUST BEING PEOPLE AND OF COURSE EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE WE'VE MADE LONG STRIDES BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE INCLUSIVE UNTIL ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND NOTED THAT I DID NOT SAY HEALTH INSURANCE I MEAN HAIR. AND OF COURSE SHIFTING OUR POLICING CULTURE FROM A REACTIONARY. REACTIONARY MODEL TO ONE THAT PROTECTS AND VALUES LIVES IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK TO OUR COMMUNITY PULLED A COMMUNITY POLICING MODEL NOT JUST IN FRESNO. BUT IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA THAT WORKS WITH COMMUNITIES VIA COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND MEASURABLE SHARED GOALS AND OUTCOMES WE HAVE TO BREAK THAT SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THEIR HEALTH. BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA CHEAPER TRULY OLD IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. HELLO OKAY COOL HI US SO HI MY NAME IS LESLIE MARTINEZ -- I AM FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BORN AND RAISED IN FROM A SMALL TOWN CALLED LINDA CALIFORNIA SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT ARE ALSO THINGS THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH. IN MY ACTUAL LIFE GROWING UP I WORK AT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND COUNT ABILITY WERE BASED HERE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. BUT I I WILL NOT LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO MENTION OUR WORK IN THE EAST COACHELLA VALLEY. THAT HAS VERY SIMILAR -- ISSUES AS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THROUGH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING RESEARCH. LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND POLICY ADVOCACY WE GUIDE. POLICY ON THE LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS THAT WE WORK ALONGSIDE HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND THE PRIORITIES ARE MET SPECIFICALLY ALWAYS AROUND HEALTH. THE OUR OUR WORK. IS POWERED AND IT ALWAYS UNDER THE NOTION THAT YOU CANNOT SEPARATE CLIMATE CHANGE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE LAND USE. THE PRISON PIPELINE ANY OF THESE THINGS HOW ARE ALSO GUIDE ARE ALSO PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. ISSUE YOU CAN NOT WE CANNOT JUST TACKLE ONE AND EXPECT THE REST TO FALL INTO PLACE WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A TOGETHER. THE CHILDREN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OF YOU AS YOU ALL KNOW AND A LOT OF US HERE. I HAVE EXPERIENCE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE HAVE HIGHER RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES THAN ANYWHERE ELSE WE LIVE NEXT TO TOXIC -- MEET RENDERING PLANTS AND WE SMELL BAD AIR AND WE BREATHE IT AND YET WE'RE STILL AT TRACK PRACTICE EVERY SINGLE DAY -- SPECIFICALLY THE KIDS AT ANDERSON WHO I SEE EVERY SINGLE MORNING RUNNING -- IN CANNES TWO CREEK WHICH IS I.. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AROUND BILL HAD MENTIONED THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES ARE VERY RULE CAN TO A CREEK IS ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE NEAREST HOSPITAL. CAN TO A CREEK -- THAT HOSPITAL IS NOT IN FRESNO COUNTY IT'S ACTUALLY KINGS COUNTY IT'S IN HANFORD -- WHEN WE MOST COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE A QUARREL ACCESS TO PARKS ED THERE? AND THE WORST PART IS THAT THEY USE THEIR THEY TRY EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY ADVOCATE TO HAVE TRANSPORTATION THE ADVOCATE. FOR RESOURCES TO COME INTO THEIR COMMUNITY -- I THINK I HAVE I HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BACK UP MY WHOLE NARRATIVE SO I THINK THE FIRST THING WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON IS THE CLIMATE RIGHT WE NEED CLIMATE RESILIENCY DOLLARS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE NEED TO TARGET THOSE. HERE AND IN THESE COACHELLA VALLEY THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES WE'VE ALL SEEN HOW SUCCESSFUL IT HAS BEEN IN THE CITY OF FRESNO BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THAT THOSE DOORS AREN'T AVAILABLE TO CAN TO AGREE. THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE TO LIVE THERE THOSE ARE DOLLARS THAT NEED TO COME TO THE COMMUNITIES ARE FACING CLIMATE CHANGE HAD ON M. SENATOR DOUBLES AS BE. THREE FIFTY ONE ED IT WOULD MAKE IT WOULD MAKE EXPLICIT THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO FOR THE FUNDING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE MORE INVESTMENTS THAN JUST TCC WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE KIDS CAN GET TO SCHOOL. KIDS CAN GET TO THE DOCTOR. AND WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES FOLKS CANNOT GO OUT FOR A WALK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S A SCHOOL IN MADERA COUNTY LAVIGNE. THEIR SCHOOL IS LESS THAN A MILE AWAY IT'S A FIFTEEN MINUTE WALK IF CHILDREN ARE SEEN WALKING TO SCHOOL OR RIDING A BIKE THEY WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR THREE TO FIVE DAYS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO THE IT IS UNSAFE TO WALK TO SCHOOL SO THEY HAVE TO BE BUSTED. AND I'VE TALKED TO KIDS IN THERE LIKE A PLEASE JUST LET US. PLEASE HELP US SO WE CAN RIDE OUR BIKES TO SCHOOL THAT'S ALL WE WANT AND THEY CANNOT -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT ON TOP OF THIS WE ALSO REALLY NEED AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WATER. WE ALL KNOW WE'RE VERY FIRST COMMANDING EVERYBODY FOR PASSING THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER -- CENTER HOTEL FOR YOUR A DIRECT INVESTMENT TOMBSTONE I HAVE COMMUNITY MEETINGS THERE ALL THE TIME AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED AND WE THINK YOU -- BUT WE NEED MORE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT GROUND WATER IS GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER THAT IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO GO TO THE SELECT FEW THAT CAN AFFORD IT WITH -- WATER MARKETS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT WATER IS GOING TO BE CLEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE FOR FREE OF CONTAMINANTS WE KNOW THAT PESTICIDES CONTAMINATE THE WATER IN FRESNO WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND WE CAN DO THAT. I'M AIR QUALITY WE WE SANDRA POINTED OUT PRETTY WELL WE ALL LIVE IN IN A TOXIC BUBBLE WE DON'T HAVE PLACES WHERE WE CAN GO OUTSIDE EMBRY THERE I'VE SEEN. SO MANY TALK TO SO MANY PARENTS WHO THEIR KIDS HAVE ASTHMA ATTACKS AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HAD THE MY COWORKER HER SON COULD NOT GO TO A FIELD TRIP BECAUSE IT WOULD BE HIS ASTHMA WOULD BE TRIGGERED AND HE WAS UNABLE TO GO TO A FIELD TRIP. THAT EVERY OTHER KID IN HIS CLASS WAS GOING. TO WE NEED TO ADDRESS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE LAND USES THAT ARE CONTAMINATING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR SCHOOLS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DAIRIES. THAT ARC OF FEELING OUR FILLING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH METHANE AND WITH THE DERRY DIGESTERS ARE ONLY TAKING CARE OF THE METHANE BUT THERE'S ALSO KNOCKS INBOX ANOTHER SECONDARY POLLUTION'S THAT ARE HURTING COMMUNITIES AND THOSE THAT WORK ON THAT. ON THAT DAY -- WE NEED TO INSURE THAT COMMUNITY THAT -- CALL WE NEED TO SOLVE AIR QUALITY ISSUES. IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ON THE BACKS OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE CANNOT SOLVE ANY ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA ANY LONGER BUY ONLY ADDRESSING IT IN A WAY IT BY DRESSING IN WAYS THAT DOES NOT. DIRECTLY INVEST AND HELP THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES INCLUDING AIR QUALITY -- SIR -- BUT I KNOW AND I ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON A POINT THAT XANDER MADE I'M A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS M. DAUGHTER FARM WORKING IMMIGRANTS AND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND I I I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY AND WATCHING HAVE FELT THIS BUT THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN WATCHING YOUR PARENTS COME HOME FROM A TEN HOUR WORK DAY. COVERED IN DIRT. AND THEIR PAYCHECK DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT WORK THEY PUT OUT. IT THERE ISN'T AND I AND I SURE THIS BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO THIS WE NEED TO FIND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN A WAY THAT HELPS US GROW. IN A WAY THAT KIDS CAN KIDS CAN GO TO BERKELEY AND IT'S NOT OH MY GOSH IT'S YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT LEÓN THESE ALL ABOUT THAT'S WHAT LYNN LYNN THERE CAN DO -- TO BECAUSE IT WHEN WE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIME YOUR PARENTS AND HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY MILK. AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIMES THAT YOUR PARENTS HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND ASK SOMEBODY DOWN THE STREET FOR MONEY TO TAKE YOU TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE YOU ARE SICK AND HAVE A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE DEGREES. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE AND THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DIRECT INVESTMENT A LOT BETTER AND THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN EAST COULD TELL ABOUT. WE ARE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM THAT STATEMENT BRING IT ON BUT WE NEED. WE NEED GOOD INVESTMENTS TODAY WE NEEDED THEM YESTERDAY AND I'M NOT AND AT THE SAME TIME AS I GIVE YOU THESE RECOMMENDATIONS I'M ALSO HERE TO HELP YOU ALONG THE WAY. I AM HERE TO LOBBY I'M HERE TO WORK HARD I WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE MY HOMETOWN MY HOME MIKE LITERALLY LIKE MY FAVORITE PLACE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE BEST PLACE EVER SO PEOPLE STOP CALLING IT THE FLYOVER COUNTY. OF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE TALK ABOUT IS THAT THOSE GUYS THE NECKY -- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. GOOD MORNING WELL I GUESS IS CLOSER TO GOOD AFTERNOON -- I JUST WANT TO SAY BEFORE I START I AND APPRECIATIVE AND HUMBLE TO BE UP HERE. THE AMAZING WORK THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY HONESTLY I WAS SITTING IN MY C. AND I CHOKED UP. I THINK WE ARE HERE BECAUSE ROTH PASSIONATE. ABOUT THESE THINGS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO US. BUT WATCHING EVERYONE SPEAK ABOUT IT. MADE ME FEEL GOOD. ONE SO I'M ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY FROM SAN DIEGO -- I AM A PROGRAM MANAGER RIGHT NOW AT THE FRESNO CENTER. BUT I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WAS THE RECIPIENT OF THE WAS THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. I CAME A PARTICULARLY TO OFFER SERVICES -- IN MENTAL HEALTH AMONG. ARMONK POLITICIAN. AND I'M SORRY I MONNING POPULATION EXCUSE ME SO I APOLOGIZE I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS -- THERE'S A IT REALLY SPEAKS TO VOICING US TO WRITE SO THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT FOR A LONG TIME HISTORICALLY HAD HAD NO VOICE. SO WHEN WE SET UP HERE OUR VOICES TRAUMA. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO SEE STUFF. I WAS VERY PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LIVING WELL PROGRAM AND ACTUALLY THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR IS HERE TODAY HE'S TRANSLATING. DOCTOR D. AS LONG. AND DURING MY TIME THERE WE DIDN'T NOTICE FOR REALLY PREDOMINANT DIAGNOSES. ET IS D. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND GENERALIZED EXCITED DISORDER. IT'S A BIG DEAL THE MAJORITY OF THE CLIENTS WE C. R. MONOLINGUAL SOUTHEAST ASIAN. THEY COULDN'T SIX SERVICES. ANYWHERE ELSE FOR WHEN THE SCOTT SERVICES THAT COUNTY MAYBE THEY FELT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH US. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT AND ECHOING AS THE IMPORTANCE OF OFFERING -- LINGUISTIC AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES [INAUDIBLE] IT'S WORKING. THE OTHER THING THAT WE TOOK IT UPON OURSELVES. WITH DOCTORS WRONG AS THE SPEAR HEAD WAS CREATING A TRAINING PROGRAM. SO I WAS LUCKY TO GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM TO BE ABLE. TO ONE OFFER MY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN LONG. ALSO BE ABLE TO BE SUPERVISED BY CLINICAL AND LICENSED MON CLINICIANS. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE -- THAT'S MISSING. I HAVE TO MAN AFTER I LEFT IT HAS. GIVEN ME A DIFFERENT LINES WHEN I APPROACH OUR CLIENTS. I REALLY WANT TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GROWING OUR OWN. MAYBE PERHAPS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS OUT THERE SO WE RECENTLY KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO HELP WE NEEDED IT TODAY. AND SO WE BEGAN THIS TRAINING PROGRAM VERY. YEAH STILL HUMBLE -- AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT -- I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE FUNDING AROUND THESE THINGS. SO MY LAST TWO THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST. ONE PLEASE SUPPORT DISAGGREGATED DATA FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND HEALTH AGENCIES. HISTORICALLY THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY HAS BEEN. COUPLE TOGETHER BUT BECAUSE OF THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE THE TRUE NEED OF SOME OF OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTERPARTS. THEIR NEED IS JUST UNIQUE AT THE VERY LEAST THE MALL COMMITTEE ONLY CAME HERE FORTY YEARS AGO. MY PARENTS STILL SPEAK ONLY LONG. AND EVEN WHEN WE GO TO LIKE APPOINTMENTS I HAVE TO GO AND TRANSLATE. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR YOU KNOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER. I THINK THE DATA ITSELF WILL HELP AND I SEE IT BETTER AND ALSO PERHAPS GET MORE FUNDING FOR FUNDING IS NEEDED. THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS DEFINITELY LIKE EXPANDING THESE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CARE. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A BILL OUT THERE -- EIGHTY FIVE TWELVE CULTURAL COMPETENCY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT. AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS. I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PAPERS APPEAR. WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO HONOR THE SPACE -- THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPLEMENTING ETHNIC STUDIES FROM THE CATER TWELVE TO HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE AND WHICH IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT PREVENTION. WHEN WE TEACH OUR KIDS ABOUT THE DIVERSITY THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THE HOPE SAYS THAT? THERE WILL BE LESS POLARIZATION AND MORE DIALOGUE. DIALOGUE ABOUT REALLY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION. AROUND GENDER MAYBE AROUND RACE ABOUT SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. AND AS ALWAYS RIGHT. ALSO WE WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT ABC THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THE LAOTIAN HISTORIES AND CULTURAL STUDIES. I NEED TO BE INCLUDED. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO SAY BETH ON EVEN TODAY AS A C. HERE. I AM AN AND I GUESS. A BY PRODUCT OF THESE REALLY AMAZING AND SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS I DIDN'T GET HERE BY CHANCE. IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL -- DESIGN WITH COMPASSION AND INTENTION AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A SITE WHEN WE CONTINUE TO DESIGN OUR LEGISLATION WE NEED TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN MIND. WHICH CHANGING WORDS WE REALLY IMPACT FAMILIES THAT WE DIDN'T MEAN TO ANTHONY THAT'S WHY I REALLY APPRECIATED -- THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DO SENATORS I. WHAT YOU HAVE SAID EARLIER. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GO ABOUT IT WITH OUR HEARTS. AND SO THAT MANY COMMUNITIES WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON EITHER YET BUT I'M AMERICA HERNANDEZ AND I'M THE SOCIAL SERVICES COORDINATOR FOR KIDS IN NEED OF DEFENSE -- I'M VERY HUMBLE TO BE HERE ESPECIALLY WITH MY COUNTERPARTS HERE MY COLLEAGUES -- AND TO BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR GROUP THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SEEING IN THE NEWS LATELY A LOT BUT DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- SO I WORK WITH UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN -- THEY ARE CHILDREN WHO ENTERED THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WITHOUT A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN -- THE MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE WORK WITH ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE PERSECUTION NEGLECT -- INDOOR ABANDONMENT IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. AND THEY LARGELY COME FROM THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE OF HONDURAS EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA. WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE BORDER THEY'RE USUALLY HUNGRY TIRED AND SCARED? THE FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS RUSH SCREENING BY BORDER PATROL OR SHELTER STAFF. SOME OF THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS OR EVEN WORSENED DURING THEIR TIME AT BORDER PATROL CUSTODY -- FROM DAY ONE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AFFECTS YOUR VIEWS. EVEN AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE DETENTION LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF DEPORTATION AFFECTS THEIR SENSE OF CONNECTION TO SYSTEMS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND IT EMOTIONALLY BURDENS THEM FAR BEYOND WHAT THEIR YOUNG MINDS CAN PROCESS. WELL UNACCOMPANIED MINORS DO YOU BENEFIT FROM SOME CHILD SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS THE US GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY CHILD REGARDLESS OF AGE WITH THE FREE ATTORNEY. THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO FACE THE COMPLEX IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ON THEIR OWN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT. MINORS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REMAIN SAFELY IN THE UNITED STATES IF THEY HAVE AN ATTORNEY. NATIONALLY CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS ARE THE TOP TWO STATES RECEIVING RELEASED UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. FROM OCTOBER TWENTY THIRTEEN TO MAY TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED OR THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN. JUST FROM OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR TO MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN OVER FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN ALREADY IN THE VALLEY. IN CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY. KIND WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND IS THE LEADING NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THAT NO REFUGEE OR UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT CHILD. HAS TO GO TO IMMIGRATION COURT ALONE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THREE OFFICES WE EVER SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE ARE FRESNO OFFICE WHICH IS A SATELLITE OFFICE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO. AND OUR LA OFFICE. WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO OVER TWENTY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE THE ONLY NOT -- NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER THAT -- WORKS SOLELY ON ISSUES FOR UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY SEPARATION CRISIS WE ALSO EXPANDED OUR SERVICES TO SERVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES AS NEWCOMERS. INTO THE US DUE TO THEIR COMPLEX LEGAL CASES LANGUAGE ACCESS PROGRAM PROBLEMS AND PREVALENCE OF HAVING EXPERIENCED EXTREME TRAUMA. THEY ARE SET ON DIFFERENT AS LINK IS POINTED OUT TO OTHER IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS INCLUDING. THE DACA RECIPIENTS LIKE MYSELF BECAUSE THEY ARE NEWCOMERS AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SETS OF CHALLENGES. ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD EMERGENCY HOUSING MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES ARE CRUCIAL TO THEIR WELL BEING AND THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE AND WORK ON THEIR CASES. I KIND WE RECOGNIZE THAT PROTECTING IMMIGRANT CHILDREN'S RIGHTS REQUIRES A HOLISTIC APPROACH AND GOES BEYOND PROVIDING JUST LEGAL SERVICES. OUR SOCIAL COORDINATING SERVICES TEAM WAS CREATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO DO JUST THAT. AND HOPPER CHILDREN A TRAUMA INFORMED WEIGHT AS THEY WORK ON THEIR IMMIGRATION CASES. IN MY ROLE AS A SOCIAL SERVICES COORDINATOR AND THE ONLY ONE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEYS. AND CONNECT THE CHILDREN TO THE SUPPORT SERVICES THEN HELP THEM ADDRESS CHALLENGES AN ADVOCATE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IN OUR EXPERIENCE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FACE MANY CHALLENGES BUT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME SPECIFIC THE TODAY. NUMBER ONE THEIR LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. NUMBER TWO THE LIMITED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR AN ENGLISH LEARNER. LINK ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THREE THERE'LL GENERAL LACK OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD RENT TOILETRIES AND CLOSE. NUMBER FOUR TRAUMA AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES A NUMBER FIVE DIFFICULTY IN NAVIGATING HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE -- SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE OBSTACLE OR IN PAN IN LIMITED OR NON EXISTING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. REPRESENT A BARRIER FOR CHILDREN TO CONNECT TO REALLY IMPORTANT RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OR EVEN THEIR ATTORNEYS. CHILDREN WHO RESIDE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH CAN BE TWO TO FIVE HOURS AWAY FOR THEM. SOMETIMES OUR COURT HEARINGS ARE EIGHT THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE VALLEY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO GET THERE IN TIME AND PAY. PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM RIGHTS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF THEY MISS THEIR COURT HEARING THEY CAN BE GIVEN A REMOVAL ORDER. IT IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR THEM TO NOT HAVE OPTIONS. THE TRAINS ARE SOMETIMES AN OPTION IF THEY'RE HEARING IS LATER ON IN THE DAY BUT OFTEN TIMES THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THE SECOND HUGE OBSTACLE FOR THE KIDS OUR CHALLENGE IS THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. ESPECIALLY FOR THE TEEN YOUTH THE CHILDREN THAT WE WORK WITH MOST OFTEN HAVE VERY LIMITED EDUCATION. AND HAVE DIFFICULTY READING AND WRITING EVEN IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE WHEN THEY COME TO OUR SCHOOLS THEY'RE PLACING CLASSES LIKE HISTORY AND PHYSICS. IN ENGLISH AND HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPORT. AND WHEN THEY ARE IN THESE CLASSES THE OFTEN FAIL. WHICH REALLY AFFECTS YOUR SELF ESTEEM FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF STRESS DUE TO TRAUMA BEING M. IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS. AND TRYING TO ADJUST TO THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENTS THIS IS DEVASTATING I HAVE WORKED WITH DOZENS OF CHILDREN WHO COMPLAIN OF STOMACH ACHES. HEADACHES AND DEPRESSION LINKED TO THEIR STRESSORS AT SCHOOL THIS CAN LEAD TO BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS SUSPENSIONS AND POOR ATTENDANCE. WHEN YOUNG PERSON STRESS WAS SO SEVERE THAT SHE HAS HAD ATTEMPTED SUICIDE? BECAUSE SHE WAS ASKED TO READ AN ESSAY OUTLOUD IN ENGLISH AND FRONT OF HER PEERS. AND SHE SPENT A WEEK IN THE HOSPITAL. TO ADDRESS THIS I HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE FRESNO UNIFIED MENDOTA UNIFIED. AND MODESTO UNIFIED AND GIVING PRESENTATIONS TO COUNSELORS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER STAFF AN ADMINISTRATOR. I WORK TO EDUCATE THEM ON UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT STORIES AND PARTICULAR NEEDS AND TO CREATE REFERRAL SYSTEMS TO DIRECT CHILDREN TO STAFF THAT CAN GUIDE AND SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE THIRD IS A GENERAL LACK OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR BASIC NEEDS. ANOTHER SOURCE OF STRESSES THAT THEY CANNOT WORK BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PAY BACK HUGE DEBTS THAT THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES SOMETIMES -- OR CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR HOUSEHOLDS SOMETIMES WE CAN CONNECT THEM WITH FOOD BANKS CLOTHING CLOSETS WERE SECURE DONATIONS THROUGH GIVE CARDS COATS OR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FINDING THE SORCERER'S RESOURCES IS NOT VERY EASY. ONE CHILD THAT WE WORKED WITH TOOK A PHOTO OF HER EMPTY FRIDGE. AND THE CLOSEST -- FOOD BANK TO HER WAS FORTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY AND THERE WAS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET THERE. AND THE PAST YEAR I HAVE ALSO HAD VARIOUS CLIENTS BECOME HOMELESS IT WAS NOT ONLY STRESSFUL INFORMATIK FOR THEM BUT ALSO EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR ME. AS A SCRAMBLE TO FIND THEMSELVES SAFE SHELTER IN AREAS WITHOUT MANY OPTIONS. HERE IN THE VALLEY THERE AREN'T VERY MANY SHELTERS FOR YOUTH IN FACT HERE FRESNO WE ONLY HAVE ONE YOUTH SHELTER FOR UNDER. EIGHTEEN AND ONE TRANSITIONAL YOU SHELTER THAT IS NOT FULL TIME HAS A WAIT LIST MOST OF THE TIME. EARLIER THIS YEAR I HAVE TO CONNECT THE CLIENT TO SHELTER HOURS AWAY IN RICHMOND. IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE HIS ONLY CONNECTION WAS KIND STAFF HIS EYES GLAZED OVER IN HIS VOICE WAVERED AS I TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDED TO RELOCATE. TO AN UNFAMILIAR AREA HE DID NOT KNOW. ANOTHER CLIENT WAS EIGHTEEN PREGNANT IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. WHERE SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE SHE HAD BRUISES AND MARKS AND WAS EXHAUSTED WE WENT TO A LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER WHERE THEY INTERVIEWED HER FOR ALMOST AN HOUR? ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP HER BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE CAPACITY. THEY GAVE HER A LIST OF SHELTERS IN OUR WAY BUT NO TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS TO GET THERE. ANOTHER BIG OBSTACLE FOR OUR CHILDREN IS THEIR OWN TRAUMA. THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFERED FROM TRAUMA AND OTHER FORMS OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT CREATE. OR EXACERBATE. THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. ALL OF THE EARLIER CHALLENGES. I AM AN ADDITIONAL YOUTH ANXIETY AND STRESS CAN ALSO LEAD TO BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT CAN MANIFEST IN PHYSICAL WAYS SUCH AS HEADACHE STOMACH ACHES TIREDNESS AND A LACK OF ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS ON IMPORTANT TASKS. AND WORST CASE SCENARIO SELF HARM. CULTURAL STIGMA IN SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. THE FOURTH CHALLENGE IS NAVIGATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND DENTAL CARE -- SYSTEMS. IT IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES -- BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG WAIT LISTS NOT ENOUGH POSITIONS THAT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH WHEN OUR KIDS ARE SPEAKING INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES ESPECIALLY -- WE REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME HERE AT HAVING THEM ACCESS THOSE SERVICES. ONE CHILD THAT I EXIT ASSISTED WAS TOLD BY A MEDICAL CLINIC THAT SHE WOULD GO BLIND FROM AN EYE INFECTION SHE HAD FOR HER HOME COUNTRY. IF SHE DID NOT REALLY -- RECEIVE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY SPECIALISTS BUT LUCKILY I HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOME OF THE LOCAL HEALTH CENTERS AND I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT SYSTEM WITH. HER AND CONNECTED TO A SPECIALIZED A SPECIALIST I WAS ABLE TO SAVE ONE OF HER EYES -- AND SHE NOW HAS PARTIAL VISION IN THE OTHER I.. THROUGH WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE PROVIDERS -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE REFERRAL SYSTEMS ARE MORE CHILD FRIENDLY AND TRAUMA INFORMED. SOME OF MY RECOMMENDATIONS AND THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROP -- PROBLEMS ARE THE FOLLOWING -- WHEN AIMING TO CREATE MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONS RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS TO GENERATE WARM REFERRALS FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN? I HAVE BILL TO CAPACITY BY CREATING A REFERRAL DATABASE OF OVER THREE HUNDRED CONTACTS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT SCHOOLS. PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS FOOD BANKS SHELTERS AND MENTAL AND MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDERS. I MENSUR ATTORNEYS WHO ARE OFTEN NOT TRAINED ON TRAUMA ISSUES ON PROVIDING WARM REFERRALS FOR SOCIAL SERVICES THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA ON LEGAL CASE AND BUILD A REPORT WITH THEIR CLIENTS. I HAVE CREATED CASE PLANS BY MAKING RESOURCE LIST FOR OUR CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH WARM REFERRALS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY VETTED. AND BILL PARTNERSHIPS WITH I HAVE ALSO WORKED ON CARETAKER CAPACITY BY PROVIDING THE RESOURCES AND WORKSHOPS THAT FOCUS ON CARING FOR CHILDREN WITH DRAMA AND GIVING THEM GUIDANCE FOR NAVIGATING COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF CARE. I HAVE ORGANIZED RESOURCE FAIRS AND FOUR CITIES FRESNO MENDOTA MODESTO IN STOCKTON WHERE I INVITE MULTIPLE FAMILIES AND BRING LOCAL SERVICES PROVIDERS TO DO WORKSHOPS ON MENTAL HEALTH. FINANCIAL LITERACY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND WHERE ARE KIND ATTORNEYS DO KNOW YOUR RIGHTS PRESENTATIONS WE GIVEAWAY DONATED FOOD CLOTHING. TOYS BOOKS AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES. WE ALSO HAVE COORDINATED TECHNOLOGY PROJECT WHERE WE GIVE PHONES TO OUR CLIENTS THAT ALLOW THEM TO CONNECT WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS SERVICE PROVIDERS VIA TECHNOLOGY -- IN THIS PROJECT WE ARE MINDFUL. SO THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ENHANCES THE ABILITY FOR THE CHILDREN TO COMMUNICATE AND DEVELOP TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS RATHER THAN TRYING TO INAPPROPRIATELY SUPPLANT MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES -- IN CONCLUSION. IN THE ONLY SERVICE A SOCIAL SERVICES COORDINATOR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HAS IT'S ALL BEEN A A CHALLENGE AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS I HAVE WORKED WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHILDREN. AND CAN SAY FROM BOTH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS AN IMMIGRANT AND YOUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT A PERSON'S IMMIGRATION STATUS CAN DEEPLY AFFECT THEIR HEALTHAXIS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS VASTLY UNDERSERVED AND IN NEED OF FUNDING FOR MORE RESOURCES MEDICAL PROVIDERS SHELTERS TRANSPORTATION. AND LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS. AND I WILL EMPHASIZE THE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS IN THE VALLEY WE REALLY ARE GRATEFUL FOR SOME OF THE WORK IN -- SACRAMENTO TO ADDRESS THE FELLOWSHIP IN THE LEGAL NEEDS OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY HERE IN FRESNO -- WE KNOW THAT THROUGH ADVERSE -- THROUGH THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT A CHILD'S MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE CAN GREATLY INFLUENCED MANY DOMAINS OF THEIR PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR HEALTH PROFILE OVER TIME. LACK OF ACCESS TO BASIC SAFETY NET RESOURCES CREDIBLE EDUCATION SUPPORT AND A SENSE OF STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS CAN HAVE LIFELONG RAMIFICATIONS AND IF JOHN. ON A CHILD'S HEALTH. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND FOR HEARING ABOUT UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN -- I HAVE PROVIDED SOME MATERIALS THAT ARE IN THE FRONT AND WE ARE HERE -- FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR IF YOU WANT TO OFFER SUPPORT TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GIVE THE PALO ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AND BEFORE I OPEN UP THE QUESTIONS TO MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WANNA SAY I WANT TO THANK. YOU ALL OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ALLOWED US IN OUR INTRODUCTION TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF YOUR BACKGROUND -- BEING IMMIGRANTS YOURSELVES ARE COMING OR BEING CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS I THINK -- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A FOR ME AT LEAST HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE WAY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE NATIONAL RHETORIC WE'VE ALL BEEN. TRAUMATIZED AND EXPOSED TO OVER THIS LAST WEEK AND THE WAY WE RESPOND IS THROUGH. SOCIAL COHESION AND POLITICAL COHESION AND PROBLEM SOLVING SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL NARRATIVE AS A PART OF OUR INTRODUCTION. QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES CENTER RUBIO. THERE IS SO MUCH TOM PACKED AND EVERYTHING THAT EACH ONE OF YOU HAS SHARED BY FIRST LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO -- CURRENTLY I HAVE A BILL THAT HAS TO DO WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT MY PRIMARY FOCUS OF THAT BILL IS JUST TRAUMA. AND THAT'S SUCH A DIFFICULT THING TO SCOTT HI EVERYONE'S TRAUMAS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT STAGES WHETHER IT BE YOU KNOW CHILDHOOD TRAUMA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TOM I AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF ALL OUR CHILDREN BEING CAGE AND NOT HAVING THEIR PARENTS PHYSICALLY THERE. WITH THEM AND AND I WORRY THAT SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WE SEE ALL THESE YOU KNOW FIVE SIX YEAR OLD BEAT ADULTS WERE -- ENTER ADULTHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING PERHAPS ALL THE FACTS OF THAT TRAUMA THAT. YOU KNOW FOR WHETHER IT BE YOU KNOW. CRIMINAL ELEMENT TO IT A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SINCE WHY WORRY QUITE A BIT -- AND BECAUSE YOU'RE THE EXPERT I'M GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT A BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH OUR HOUSE ONLY BECAUSE I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. AND I I HEARD YOU SAY YOU'RE RIGHT NOW THERE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LEGAL SERVICES OR OR ADVOCATES TO TO HELP SUCH A LARGE POPULATION THAT NEEDS HELP -- AND I KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY. WHAT THEY CALL -- I THINK THEY THEY COLUMN -- THEY'RE JUST ADVOCATES OF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY LAWYERS OR LEGAL COUNSEL'S BUT THERE ADVOCATES AND THERE'S A BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE THE ASSEMBLY THAT. WILL MAKE IT A EAGLE. TO TO BE AN ADVOCATE -- TEAM MEMBER -- SENATOR TOWER WHAT THE COLUMN. AND NOW SO SO ANYHOW AT THE WHAT THEY DO I THINK ABOUT THE A CREDITOR REPRESENTATIVES THERE YOU GO AND SO I WANT TO JUST HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS I GUESS AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH SIDES THERE'S A SIDE. YOU KNOW THAT SAY THAT. THEY MAY BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF COMMUNITIES AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER SITE THAT SAYS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LEGAL YOU KNOW ON COUNCILS OR OR ATTORNEYS TO HELP IMMIGRATION VICTIMS SO WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT BECAUSE I LIKE I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOOD OR BAD CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR INSIGHT INTO THAT PLEASE. THE I A A CREDIT REPRESENTATIVES ARE GREAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINED -- JUST SPECIFICALLY IN THIS AREA OF LAW WHICH IS IMMIGRATION -- AND I THINK THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT. ASSET TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THESE BA ACCREDITED AND DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ALREADY HAVE THEM AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM. AND THEY ARE OFTEN TRAINED AND AND ARE RECEIVING ENOUGH SUPPORT FROM THE ATTORNEYS THAT SUPERVISE THEM. I'M. WHAT I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF THE IS LIKE NOT THE IDEALS OR CONSULTANTS WHO DO NOT KNOW IMMIGRATION LAW IMMIGRATION LAWS EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT EVEN FOR ATTORNEYS TO NAVIGATE? SO I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY WHO IS NOT TRAINED AND DOES NOT HAVE AN A SPECIFIC ACCREDITATION SHOULD BE PRACTICING IMMIGRATION LAW OR GIVING ADVICE OF ANY KIND. SO AS LONG AS THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF IF THEY'RE UNDER THE WING OF A AN IMMIGRATION LAWYER -- YOU THINK THAT THAT'S ADEQUATE OR LIKE I SAY SO COMPLEX AND FOR SOMEONE THAT'S NOT IT YOU KNOW A LAWYER IT'S IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES AND WHAT THEY DO -- I HAVE SIXTY SIX MY DISTRICT AND I REALLY TRY TO FOCUS ON BEING PROACTIVE AND AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR WORK I EVEN HAVE MY STAFF GO IN CALL EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM AND ASK YOU KNOW ARE YOU A LAWYER I NEED. LEGAL ADVICE JUST TO SEE HOW HONEST THEY WERE ABOUT WHAT THE WORK THEY DO IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM WAS VERY HONEST AND SAID NO I'M NOT A LAWYER. BUT I CAN HELP YOU NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND SO I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THAT NOT NOT ONE LIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS VERY CLEAR THEY'RE NOT LAWYERS AND BUT THEY WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE AS TO GETTING THE RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE SERVICE BUT BUT ANYHOW I THINK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME DEALING WITH AN AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT. WE NEED TO KNOW DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NOW BUT FEEL FREE TO CALLING GIVE US ADVICE ON HOW WE CAN PROCEED THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE HAS BEEN SOME FUNDING FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY HAS GONE TO THE BAY AREA OR TO LA WHERE THEY ARE VERY HEAVILY IMPACTED BY -- UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN BUT HERE IN THE VALLEY WE DIDN'T RECEIVE VERY MUCH FUNDING AT ALL AND IT'S A VERY LARGE AREA. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE AS BIG AS NUMBERS AS THE THE? BIG CITIES BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE KIDS HAVE TO FACE THAT ARE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE SOMETIMES GREATER -- BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF RESOURCES SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN SUPPORT IS MORE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THANK YOU AND WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER IF THERE WAS A ALLOCATION KIND OF METHODOLOGY AT ALL WE WERE FIGHTING SO HARD TO GET THE MONEY ALLOCATED SO WE WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT [INAUDIBLE] DR. THANK YOU AND IF I CAN I JUST WANT TO GO DOWN THE SEQUENCE OF PANELISTS FIRST BECAUSE SANDRA WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR AWHILE AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE ME AT HELLO. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW SON AROUND THE WORK SHE'S DOING WITH BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES SHE ACTUALLY ACTIVATED ME A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A PHYSICIAN. ADVOCATING FOR HEALTH FOR ALL AND I'M PROUD TO HAVE INTRODUCED A BEFORE THIS YEAR. PROVIDING AND WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AND WHAT YOU DO FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE YOU REALLY ALWAYS SPEAK PASSIONATELY ABOUT RED LINES COMMUNITIES AND I JUST FEEL THAT SOMETIMES OUR SENATOR NEEDS TO KNOW THAT IT'S THE COMMUNITY THAT I WANT. TO WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT THAT HIGH SCHOOL THAT LIVE TWENTY YEARS SHORTER THAT'S THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WENT IN SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WENT TO AS WELL. BUT IF I COULD I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING AT THE STATE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU LESLIE COMMENT. BECAUSE SP TWO HUNDRED HELPS US TO DEAL WITH CAN TO A CREEK AND TO TOMBSTONE BY PROVIDING A CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND SO THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH. THE HISTORIC. RED LINING THAT WE SEE IN THE ISSUES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION IN FUTURE YEARS TALKING ABOUT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMBING COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH WHAT OCCURRED HERE ON THE GROUND OUR COMMUNITY RALLIED TOGETHER AND CAME BEHIND A SINGULAR VISION FOR HOW TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO US CONTINUING THOSE. CONVERSATIONS IN THE FUTURE. FOR LING FANG I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LONG STORY. FORTY AND THE EFFECT THAT IT HAD ON ME AND THE NEEDING TO CREATE A MODEL CURRICULUM AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. TO HELP US TO TEACH ABOUT THE MONNING AND VIETNAMESE AND YES LAOTIAN CULTURES. THAT OCCURRED WITH OUR SECRET WAR AND WHAT WE KNOW HERE IT'S A STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD I CAN ONLY BE TOLD. BY THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO OFTEN TIMES ARE NOW PASSING AWAY FAR BEFORE THEIR TIME. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MAYBE THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THE DOCTOR WEBER CARRIES AND I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN HOW THAT MODEL CURRICULUM WE CAN INSTITUTED HERE AT FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT AMERICA REALLY WAS YOUR ADVOCACY WORKING ON THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE WERE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO SECURE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WAS SIGNED. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. AND THAT FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL PROVIDE A FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM OUT OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO. THOSE FELLOWS WILL THEN GO AFTER THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN SAN FRANCISCO TO BOTH THE CENTRAL COAST AND CENTRAL VALLEY. BECAUSE WHAT WE WERE STRUGGLING TO HAVE AND MEET SENATOR MITCHELL. WAS THE ONE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENT THAT SAYS YOU NEED THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE LAWYERS. WE COULDN'T THEN PULL DOWN THE RESOURCES OF ONE CALIFORNIA. THIS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY BUILDING TO THEN PULL DOWN. FUTURE FUNDS WELL. BUT I WANTED TO TALK IF I COULD ON TWO ISSUES THAT YOU HAD AMERICA AS WELL ABOUT FOOD AND TOILETRIES. LAST YEAR IN OUR STATE BUDGET WE INCLUDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DIAPER BAGS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS CAME HERE TO OUR FRESNO FOOD BANK. WE'VE. ASSIGNED EIGHT DIFFERENT REGIONALS PLACES WHERE THEY CAN DISTRIBUTE THOSE DIAPERS I WOULD LOVE. TO SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THE RIGHT PLACES. BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND ANYWAY WE CAN HELP WITH DIAPERS. LAST AND I WILL I SEE THAT LOOK SENATOR MITCHELL. AND IT'S ON NAVIGATION. IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW A BIT TOO WELL WITHIN THE E. R. WHICH IS PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET LOST IN STONE SAFETY NET DOESN'T WORK THEY ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE AND SO WE CREATED A PILOT PROGRAM AND THERE'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I'M LOOKING TO THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE. OUT IN THE CROWD HERE TODAY. THERE'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN A GRANT PROGRAM AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO HIRE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR PEER NAVIGATOR IN YOUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION AND FIGURE OUT IF THIS TYPE OF POSITION WOULD HELP YOUR HOSPITAL. BECAUSE IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND IT'S WORKED OUT OF THE UC DAVIS. AND IT'S QUITE EXCITING AND I JUST WANTED. TO PUT A PIN IN THAT FOR PEOPLE IN THE CROWD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK ON THIS PANEL AND THANK YOU GUYS FOR ADVOCACY. THANK YOU WE WANT TO GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THIS AMAZING POWER THANK YOU SO MUCH. AFTER WE HEAR FROM PUBLIC COMMENT I'M GONNA ASK DR GALLEON AND MY COLLEAGUES TO BE PREPARED FOR CUTTING YOUR CLOSING REMARKS -- FOR TODAY TO SHARE YOUR AHA MOMENTS WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- THE I I'M GONNA ASK FOLKS TO QUEUE UP RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE.

IF SOMEONE ELSE SAYS SOMETHING I SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO IT. TRUST ME -- IF SOMEONE IS SAID SOMETHING THAT IN LINE BEFORE YOU THAT HITS YOUR POINT YOU CAN JUST SAY DITTO YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY. A FAMILY FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR HAS ALREADY PROBABLY QUITE ELOQUENTLY STATED. OF WE WILL HEAR THEM AND WE WILL HEAR ALL OF YOU. ONE MINUTE -- AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE SIGN IF I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN. A LITTLE BEYOND THAT FAIR ENOUGH. AND WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW TIME FOR TRANSLATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE TESTIFYING. I'M HOLLY TIME FOR TRANSLATION SERVICES.

MANY OF OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRIVACY AND MANY TIMES THEY ARE HAVING TO LIVE IN -- MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT SPACE TO PLAY TO EVOLVE TO JUST HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO JUST. SHARE THOSE MOMENTS AS CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY'RE HAVING TO LIVE IN APARTMENTS WHERE IT'S MORE THAN ONE FAMILY AND I THINK THAT. THE COST OF HOUSING SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ADDRESSED ESPECIALLY FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY OUR FARM LABOR COMMUNITY. AND I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS OUR EDUCATORS NEED TO BE -- BETTER PREPARED TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN -- LANGUAGE ACCESS AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT THEY CAN DEVELOP -- IN A HEALTHY WAY [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU -- SHAPE THAT NEXT WITNESS ONE MINUTE -- GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ERIC PAIN I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN INSTITUTE HERE IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA WE ADVOCATE -- ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- AND WE ARE THE CONVENER OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ROUNDTABLE WITH OVER. FIFTY AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY -- WHEN MY PANT WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN THE LATE SIX IN THE EARLY SIXTIES -- THEY SETTLED IN LOUISIANA -- AND AND MUCH LIKE THE SEGREGATED SOUTH FACED WITH RACIAL TENSION -- THEY MADE THEIR TRANSITION HERE TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY -- BECAUSE THERE WAS AS FARMERS -- THEY FELT LIKE THEY WANTED TO PROVIDE -- THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR THEIR FAMILY -- AND HERE WE ARE TODAY IN A CLIMATE HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- THAT IS PLAGUED WITH -- INTERNAL TENSION AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS IN OUR COMMUNITY -- THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WALL ST REPORT TITLED THE WORST CITIES FOR BLACK AMERICANS BASED ON NUMBERS FOR A BLACK POPULATIONS WHICH FRESNO COUNTY.

IT WAS STATED EARLIER THAT THIRTY THAT 38% OF FRESNO AND OUR CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY HERE -- THAT NUMBER IS 66% A MONTH BLACK CHILDREN -- AND 22% ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND SO BLACK RESIDENTS FACE THE HIGHEST VACATION REST REGARDLESS OF EDUCATION BLACK CHILDREN ARE IN OUR LOCAL K.

WE ASKED THAT OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO SOUND THE ALARM THAT BLACKS CENTRAL VALLEY FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING IN SILENCE.

AND YOU KNOW IN FRESNO IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I FEEL LIKE WHAT'S REALLY MISSING FROM THIS CONVERSATION IS ADDRESSING STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU KNOW IT'S THE MOST PERVASIVE FORM OF RACISM ON ITS SURFACE IT LOOKS VERY NEUTRAL -- BUT THERE'S REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUITY AND A QUALITY. AND YOU KNOW A QUALITY MEANS THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME RESOURCES BUT EQUITY MEANS BEING SYSTEMATIC AND INTENTIONAL ABOUT CLOSING DISPARITY GAPS. AND I'M SHORT ON TIME AND SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING IS -- I ASK OF FRESNO INTO ARE WORKING ON SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND POLICY MAKERS -- IS TO BE SYSTEMATIC AND INTENTIONAL IN YOUR PROCESS OF CLOSING DISPARITY GAPS AND LOOKING AT HOW WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE TOPIC OF WORK FOR SHORTAGE -- AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE OFF I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH I HAVE LOTS OF DATA HAPPY TO SHARE. BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL AND SYSTEMATIC ABOUT ADDRESSING THE VERY SMALL BLACK POPULATION THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS ENCOMPASS THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE OUR POPULATION IS SO SMALL BUT OUR DISPARITIES CONTINUE TO GROW. AND WE NEED TO BE MORE SYSTEMATIC ABOUT SPEAKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL RACISM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE NEXT WITNESS ONE MINUTE.

RESIDE AGREE -- AND SO I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU LOOK TO THE MEETING THE DEMAND REPORT -- WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM HOME CARE WORKERS THIS IS A LOWER -- AREA TO LIVE LOWER RATE.

FOR THE FAMILY AND NUTRITION FOR THE FAMILY TEACHING FAMILIES AS A HOLE THROUGH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S REALLY AMAZING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO GET DOWN TO THE GRIM ACADEMY OR WHAT THE WONDERFUL COMPANIES DOING WITH OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS IS REALLY AMAZING AND INSPIRING -- UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TODAY -- FOR SP TWO SEVEN SIX AS WELL THAT YOUR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THIS PANEL MOST OF YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THE SPELL -- AND SUPPORTED TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHICH HAS HAD SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- IN THAT DOCTORS ARE REFUSING TO TREAT PATIENTS I CAN'T FIND A PEDIATRICIAN IN THE FIRST BILL THAT WILL TREAT MY SON HE HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

IN RELATIONSHIP TO SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AND I WANNA -- KIND OF REITERATE SOME THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BETH PORTABLE HOUSING HAS A DIRECT LINK TO HEALTH. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ITS OWN IS NOT JUST PROVIDING HOUSING BUT THERE'S SEVERAL ASPECTS AS WE FACE A HOUSING SHORTAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA PERIOD BUT ALSO HERE IN THE VALLEY. IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THAT HOUSING AND WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE THINGS GO TOGETHER WE WE AND LEND OURSELVES TO RISK OF NOT MEETING THOSE DEMANDS AS FAR AS OUR HOUSE HE NEEDS -- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE A HUGE SHORTAGE OF CONTRACTORS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND THAT. EQUALLY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT THERE IS ALSO A GREAT NEED FOR TRADES IN OUR CENTRAL VALLEY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE BASIC NEEDS THAT WE ACQUIRE. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I WANT TO SAY THAT -- A COUPLE COMMENTS MENTION ABOUT EDUCATION AND CHILDREN BEING BASICALLY ALMOST PIGEON HOLED AND MOVING DIRECTLY INTO -- THE THE SYSTEM THAT I FEEL WERE -- NOT SUPPORTING OUR CHILDREN AND THAT WAY BY PROVIDING APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AT THE EDUCATION LEVELS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL.

COMPLETELY MY MOM AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD JUST LEAVE THE ROOM AND STILL NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT THE OPTIONS WERE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE FACING. AND IT JUST WASN'T CLEAR COMMUNICATION SPEAKING ALSO ON BEING BI CULTURAL WHEN YOU'RE AN INTERPRETER NOT JUST BILINGUAL YOU'RE BI CULTURAL AND MOST OF THE WORKERS THERE SOME OF THEM DO SPEAK SPANISH BUT LIKE SHE WAS MENTIONING SUMMER SALVADORIAN UNDER IT.

AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW ON THE RICH WORK FORCE HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND THE POTENTIAL WORK FOR US TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT IN NOVEL AND INTERESTING WAYS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR MY AGENCY IN THIS LEGISLATURE. ON HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT IN REAL ORDER HERE BOTH IN THE SHORT RUN IN THE LONG RUN SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE. AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT AND MORE AN ACTIVE LISTENER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU AT THIS POINT I'LL GO AHEAD AND HANDED OVER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMBLING FOR CLOSING REMARKS. THANK YOU AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS BY ACCIDENT THAT EVERY PANELIST WE HAD WAS FEMALE. AND SO THE HASH TAG WOMEN LEADING FRESNO IS QUITE APPROPRIATE. BUT THERE'S A WOMAN WHO'S ALSO LEADING CALIFORNIA AT THE MOMENTS THAT I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION AND THAT'S OUR FIRST EVER SURGEON GENERAL. SHE IS A WOMAN OF COLOR SHE IS ALSO A PEDIATRICIAN AND SHE IS CHAMPIONING A LOT OF THE WORK ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A B. THREE FORTY THAT WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO. BUT I WANTED TO DOCTOR GALLEY JUSTIN MY CLOSING COMMENTS TO ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTS AND PUT UP DR CURRY'S COMMENTS BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. TALKING ABOUT WHAT I. FRAME AS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. THE INFANT MORTALITY AND MATERNAL MORTALITY THAT WE C. AMONGST TOO MANY OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. THAT ONLY CAN IMPROVE IT FOR BEING. INTENTIONAL AND DRIVING RESOURCES AND LISTENING TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO I THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEAR FUTURE WHERE WE CAN BRING DR NINETEEN BURKE HERIS OUR SURGEON GENERAL DOWN. TO BOTH C. THESE PROBLEMS FIRST HAND AND TO HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY HOW WE CAN HELP TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO. THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU FOR REMEMBER DOCTOR REGULAR -- CENTER GALGIANI WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ONE ONE AND ALSO THANK EVERYONE WHO IS HERE AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A PAN TED NEED FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN GENERAL. ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND WE DIDN'T GO INTO DEPTH ON TRANSPORTATION. BUT AS I WAS DRIVING HERE I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WHEN I WAS FIRST IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY NINETY NINE ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME WHEN WAS FOGGY. YOU HAD TO REALLY BRACE YOURSELF IF YOU WERE TRYING TO CROSS HIGHWAY NINETY NINE BECAUSE AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY OVER PASSES ARE UNDER PASSES WE HAD AT GRADE SEPARATIONS -- THROUGH MERCED COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENTED C. TO HAVE TO SIT ON ONE SIDE AND THEN JUST GOT IT TO TRY TO GET OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY. SO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY BUT THERE STILL ARE PARTS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE FACE THAT ISSUE. AND MANY OTHERS WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS -- I THINK THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- CSU FRESNO HERE AND YOU C. MERCED WHICH HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND WE HAVE THE MEDICAL PARTNERSHIPS -- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK THAT WE CAN DO AND WE CAN FOCUS FINANCIAL RESOURCES ON PROGRAMS THAT THOSE TWO UNIVERSITIES WHERE WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS HERE. IN THE CENTER VALLEY KNOW THAT THOSE SLIDES THOSE THOSE STUDENTS FLIGHTS ARE FOR THEM AND THAT THEY WILL ASPIRE TO THE HEALTH CARE FIELDS. AND STAY HERE PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE WE KNOW IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE -- WE KNOW IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT HERE THOSE ARE JOBS THAT WE CAN'T EXPORT -- SECONDLY WE'VE PROVIDED RESOURCES BY EXPANDING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL BUT IT'S NOT HEALTHCARE FOR ALL IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ACCESS IF YOU'RE WAITING TWO MONTHS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH A PHYSICIAN OR PHYSICIANS ASSISTANT OR WHATEVER THE PROFESSIONAL MIGHT BE. THAT'S NOT ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE THE DEMAND IS DEAF LEAVE THEIR AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO REALLY GET BEHIND AS WE LOOK TOWARD WHAT OUR GOALS ARE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. SO I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- FOR EXPRESSING THOSE SENTIMENTS AND I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST THAT THE FIRST OF OF MANY HEARINGS THAT WE CAN HAVE HERE WITH OUR CENTER VALITY PARTNERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI I JUST WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES -- I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD TOO MUCH FOR ME TODAY BUT IT JUST MEANS THE WORLD TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE THIS THIS MORNING AND AND INTO THE AFTERNOON TO HEAR YOUR VOICES -- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AND A WONDERFUL AND AMAZING CHAMPION IN SACRAMENTO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WALKING AROUND THAT -- AND AND IN FIGHTING FOR YOU AND AND EXPRESSING YOUR VOICE AND I'M DOING AS MUCH AS I CAN ON MY END. AND SO YOU KNOW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO LISTEN TO HERE TO HAVE OUR COLLEAGUES HERE YOU AS WELL -- AND I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT. COMMUNICATION GOES BOTH WAYS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING IN SACRAMENTO. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES ON THE GROUND AND IF WE DON'T KNOW IT'S IT JUST? IT'S DIFFICULT TO ADVOCATE FOR SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE TODAY -- THE STORIES THAT YOU SHARED ARE VERY -- PERSONAL TO ME IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED YOU KNOW GROWING UP IN SINGER IN A RURAL COMMUNITY. AND SO PLEASE CONTINUE TO COME TO US TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY.
