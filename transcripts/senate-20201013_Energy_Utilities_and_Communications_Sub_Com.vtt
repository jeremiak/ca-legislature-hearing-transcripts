MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION.

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.972

THEATER WORLD IS ALLOWING US TO

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:13.445

M. IN HIGHLIGHTING THE TWO KEY

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:38.770
ASPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN PICKED

UP BY. CAN T. S. B. AS WELL AS

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:46.244
AS WELL AS- FEMSA IN IN

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.780
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF

CORPORATE CULTURE IN IN

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:54.119
PIPELINE SAFETY. AND SECONDLY

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:55.954
THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS WAS

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:59.557
AN ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE. NOT

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:03.094
NOT SIMPLY. A SYSTEM OPERATING

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:07.499
FAILURE. I'D ALSO POINT OUT

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:10.535
THAT THAT HAVING SPOKEN WITH.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.306

THE LEADERS FELT THAT THIS

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.016
REPORT PROVIDED A ROAD MAP FOR

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.918
THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:32.991
MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS AND I

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:37.295
THINK THAT IS. APPARENT BUT

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.596
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ONE

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:39.965
ENDS IT'S A CONTINUOUS

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.934
IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AND

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:45.570
THEREFORE NEEDS- SUSTAINED

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:50.709
COMMITMENT. THIS LEADS ME TO I

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.409
WOULD SAY MY FIRST LESSON

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:54.679
LEARNED M. THAT IS ONE CAN'T

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:56.147
ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:57.782
GOVERNMENT TO ACT AS IT WAS

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.651
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IT'S TAKEN

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.353
NEARLY TEN YEARS FOR FILMS THAT

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.957
TO PROMULGATE. NEW SAFETY- THE

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.293
NEW SAFETY OF GAS PIPELINE

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.662
REFER TO AS THE MEGA RULE AND

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:15.700
IT'S ONLY ONE PIECE OF AND JUST

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:19.037
A- GROUP THAT THAT. WILL

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:22.807
REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL OTHER

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:27.746
RULES TO FULLY. COVER WHAT THE

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:30.515
CONGRESS HAS LEGISLATED AND

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:32.717
THAT SPANNED FROM OUR SHOULD

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.152
SAY SPAWNED FROM THE SAN BRUNO

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.788
INCIDENT. CALIFORNIA'S

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:39.924
INITIATIVE- INITIATE THEIR

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.227
REFORM WITHIN A YEAR. OF THE

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:47.098
INCIDENT AND AGAIN THAT THAT'S

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.134
THE LEADERSHIP SHOWN BY THE

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.771
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO MOVE

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:57.509
FORWARD. RATHER THAN WAIT. THE

00:27:57.575 --> 00:27:59.878
SECOND LESSON LEARNED THAT I'D

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:03.748
LIKE TO JUST SAY IS THE THING

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.383
THAT REGULATE THAT REGULATED

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.218
UTILITIES LIKE LESS THAN

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:10.355
REGULATION IS THE UNCERTAINTY

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:14.726
OF NOT HAVING REGULATIONS.

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:17.128
PIPELINE OPERATORS UTILITIES

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:22.000
ARE ARE RELUCTANT TO INVEST

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:25.503
WITHOUT- IN SAFETY WITHOUT.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.507
GUIDANCE AND AGAIN I THINK THAT

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:32.644
THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE FOLLOW

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.013
THROUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER SAM

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.151
BRUNELLE. PROVIDED THAT IS

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:46.491
THAT- GUIDANCE TO ENABLE- THE

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:49.494
RESPONSE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOWED

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.995
IN THE LEADERSHIP WITH REGARD

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.564
TO THEIR SAFETY IMPROVEMENT

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.967
PROGRAM. LET ME JUST BE CLEAR

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:58.002
THAT THAT NATIONALLY PIPELINE

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:01.906
OPERATORS AND- HAVE AND ARE

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.441
INVESTING IN MEANINGFUL

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.275
IMPROVEMENTS TO PIPELINE

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:07.045
SAFETY- THE STATE DID NOT

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.180
NECESSARILY REST ON THEIR HANDS

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.783
WAITING BUT FOR FEDERAL

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.752
REGULATIONS. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:19.224
IN MY VIEW RETARDED THE ADVANCE

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.962
THE ADVANCEMENT. FINALLY I

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:27.565
THINK THAT THE- THAT THAT THAT

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:30.902
AGAIN- THE LEADERSHIP OF A IN

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.571
CALIFORNIA PROVIDED THE BREADTH

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.940
AND DEPTH HEY NECESSARY AND THE

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:39.577
PACE IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:44.315
ESSENTIALLY. IT'S A COMPLETE OR

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:45.617
WAS JUST SAY COMPLETE THE FIRST

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:50.388
STAGE GATE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.457
THE TIME THAT IT TOOK. THE

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:55.093
FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO BE

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.664
PROMULGATED SO. THE THIRD

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:01.432
LESSON I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:04.636
IS THAT MEANINGFUL SUSTAINABLE

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:07.005
AND RESILIENCE. TAKE

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:11.709
PERSISTENCE LEADERSHIP IN TIME.

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.479
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OF

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:16.414
PROGRESS IN PIPELINE SAFETY HAT

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:22.820
HAS MADE MANY. IMPROVEMENTS FOR

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:26.191
EXAMPLE THE IMP WITH REGARD TO

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:30.929
RISK IN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:33.331
MOST PIPELINE OPERATORS AT RISK

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:35.300
MODELS WERE NOTHING MORE THAN A

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.768
WHAT AN ELABORATE WAY OF

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:40.071
PRIORITIZING WHAT BASELINE

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:41.906
ASSESSMENT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:45.410
CALIFORNIA HAS HAS HAS

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:48.580
INITIATED SEVERAL. RAM AND

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:52.850
OTHER RISK APPROACHES THAT

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:57.055
ENABLE- THE FORENSICS IF YOU

00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:59.490
WILL OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWING

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.759
INVESTMENTS TO BE BETTER

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.795
TARGETED TO PREVENT AND

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:08.199
MITIGATE FAILURES. SECONDLY

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.501
NATIONALLY THERE IS BCOME A

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.904
RECOGNITION THAT SAFETY IS NOT

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.773
JUST OSHA. AND IT WAS ONE OF

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.709
THE KEY FINDINGS THAT IT IN THE

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:19.844
END THE INDEPENDENT ROUTE. YOU

00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:23.481
PANEL'S REPORT. THAT THE FOCUS

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.917
OF THE COMPANY- IT WAS ON

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:28.620
SAFETY OF ITS PEOPLE AND ITS

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.888
ATTENTION APPROPRIATE FOCUS.

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:33.157
BUT IT WASN'T THE RECOGNITION

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.360
THAT SAFETY ALSO MEANT. THE

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.662
INTEGRITY OF THE ASSETS

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:42.734
THEMSELVES. THIRD I JUST

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.903
ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT IS THIS IS

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.672
THE CONCEPT OF COURT CORPORATE

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.642
CULTURE AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:54.445
IT'S BECOME FRONT AND CENTER-

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:59.384
WITH THE- WITH DISCUSSIONS- YES

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.952
PART OF THAT PIPELINE SAFETY

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:04.422
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS BUT I THINK

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:05.990
IT AND THEN MY WORK IN IN WITH

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:08.760
UTILITIES IN IN IN THE AREA OF

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.295
PIPELINE SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.563
SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.633
CORNERSTONES THAT MUST BE

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.435
ADDRESSED IS THE ISSUE OF TRUST.

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:21.105
AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT THE

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:22.874
PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO PEOPLE

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.510
WHO ARE. AT THE POINT OF THE

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:29.514
SPEAR. AFTER FEEL TRUST. IN

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.715
THEIR MANAGEMENT THEIR

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:34.952
SUPERVISORS- IN ORDER FOR THE

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:39.057
CULTURE OF SAFETY TO OR A

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:42.560
PIPELINE INTEGRITY TO SPAWN.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:45.096
MMHM AND LASTLY THE PROGRESS

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:47.498
WITH REGARD TO THE AMALGAMATION

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:49.300
OF THE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SAFETY. AND QUALITY

00:32:52.203 --> 00:32:56.741
PROCESS IN THE. PIPELINE SAFETY

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.609
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM.

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:01.612
AT ITS CORNERSTONE IS A

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.481
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:09.187
AND IT THE INDUSTRY IT HAS

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:13.891
STEPPED UP AND- IS.

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.828
IMPLEMENTING THIS THE PROCESS

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.896
OF APPLYING SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:21.332
SYSTEMS. BUT WE'RE REALLY AT

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:27.638
THE INFANCY INFANCY STAGE IT-WILL TAKE TIME YEARS AND COME

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:33.344
COMMITMENT. SISTANCE LEADERSHIP.

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:34.312
FIVE FOUR FOR THAT TOO FORD FOR

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:37.115
THAT SYSTEM TO TAKE ROOT AND

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:40.318
FOSTER- THE NECESSARY CHANGE IN

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.687
CORPORATE CULTURE FINALLY I'D

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:43.821
LIKE TO JUST AND WITH THREE

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:46.824
CAUTIONARY OBSERVATIONS. THE

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:50.261
FIRST IS THE LOSS OF

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:53.631
INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE. IN IN

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:55.767
REVIEWING AND WORKING WITH

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.268
COMPANIES AND PIPELINE SAFETY

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.937
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ONE OF OUR

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:03.374
ONE OF OUR CLIENTS HI. HELLO

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:06.310
THIS IS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.880
IN IN THE IN THE COMPANY OVER

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:10.748
50% OF THEM HAVE BEEN WITH THE

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.650
COMPANY LESS THAN FIVE YEARS.

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.987
THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:19.090
HAVE EXPERIENCED. A MAJOR

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:22.827
INCIDENT. ARE HIDDEN IN IN

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.596
THEIR CAREERS HAS DECREASED

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:28.633
SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S IT IN ONE

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.569
HAND THAT'S THAT'S GOOD- FROM A

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:33.171
SAFETY PERSPECTIVE WE'VE MADE

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.806
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:37.074
OTHER HAND THE QUESTION IS HOW

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:38.643
DO YOU HOW DO WE MAINTAIN THAT

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.445
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:43.448
RESPONDING. AND THEREFORE THERE

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:44.615
WILL BE A NEED FOR GREATER

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.551
INVESTMENT IN TRAINING

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.953
TECHNOLOGIES EVERYTHING FROM

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.823
IMMERSION VIRTUAL REALITY

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:57.295
TRAINING IN ORDER TO- IN ORDER

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:00.097
TO. BE READY TO ACT IN AN

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:03.134
EMERGENCY. THE SECOND ITEM I

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.535
JUST WANT TO MENTION IS THE

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.537
INSIDIOUS THIS OF LATENT

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:10.041
FAILURES AND THEIR PERSISTENCE

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:12.543
WE SAW THAT IN SAN BRUNO WE SAW

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.111
YOU RECENTLY IN THE MERRIMACK

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:17.348
VALLEY AND YOU SEE IT IN IN AND

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:19.350
IT'S ALSO EVIDENT IN THE- IN

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:22.420
THE- BOEING SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:27.258
MAX- INCIDENTS. AND IT I

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.793
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.595
NECESSITATE THE INSTANT IT

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:33.664
INSTILLING OF A MINDFULNESS.

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.166
PHILOSOPHY WITHIN AN

TODAY WE ARE AT OUR RELIANCE ON

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:47.912
TECHNOLOGY. AND IN IT EVEN TO

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:51.115
SCRIPTED PROCEDURES. CAN CAN

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.217
REDUCE THEM THE MINDFULNESS AND

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:55.920
FOCUS THAT'S NECESSARY IN DAY

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.923
TO DAY ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.593
BLATANT FAILURES. AND LASTLY I

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.794
JUST WANTED T POINT OUT THAT

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:06.697
THAT RISK GOOD VERSION OF

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:10.001
SOCIETY IS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:12.603
AND WE SEE THAT RIGHTFULLY SO

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.006
WITH WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:19.510
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEREFORE AS

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:22.346
WE LOOK AT RISK AT IN THE GAP

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:24.081
IN THE INDUSTRY WE MUST TAKE

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.250
THESE INTO IT ALSO INTO

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:30.021

LUCK NOW THOUGH STILL NOT SEEN

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.936
HI. WHY IS THAT PLEASE JUST

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:02.773
CHECK THIS. WHAT WE HAD SOME

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.276
WORDS COMING OUT I THINK WE'VE

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:09.447
GOT A NOW YES RECEDED OKAY AND

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:13.050
I CAN MAKE THIS INTO FULL SLIDE

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:17.388
SHOW. SO I HAVE BEEN RISK FOR-

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.457
OVER THIRTY YEARS ORGANIZATIONS

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.758
THAT HAVE TO MANAGE HAZARDOUS

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.493
SYSTEMS WITH SAFETY AND

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.729
RELIABILITY STARTING AT. A

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.063
NUCLEAR POWER IN COMMERCIAL

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.733
AVIATION AND BRANCHING INTO A

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:30.901
WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:32.837
INFRASTRUCTURES AND I'VE SPENT.

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.105
A NUMBER OF YEARS IN CALIFORNIA

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:37.742
LOOKING AT- THE GAS AND

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:41.112
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURES

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:44.381
TELECOMS. LEVEES WATER

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.150
RESOURCES AND WATER SUPPLY

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:49.520
MARINE TRANSPORT AND- I'VE

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.288
SPENT TIME IN A WHOLE VARIETY

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.824
OF INFRASTRUCTURE ORGANIZATIONS

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:54.992
INCLUDING P. JEANNIE GAS AND

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.294
PG&amp;E ELECTRIC AND OTHER

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.730
REGULATORY AGENCIES LIKE THE

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.932
PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. AND

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:04.101
THE- CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.670
COMMISSION AND SELL EITHER OVER

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.539
THOSE YEARS FORMED A KIND OF

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:11.308
PERSPECTIVE ON OUR SAFETY

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:13.878
PROMOTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.780
AS A SYSTEM. I THOUGHT I WOULD

00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:18.015
SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THOSE-

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:20.317
FINDINGS AND PERSPECTIVES AFTER

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:22.653
YEARS AND YEARS OF INTERVIEWING

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.488
AND TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:29.460
BOTTOM. SO CERTAINLY MY

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.095
PERSPECTIVE STARTS WITH THIS

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:34.231
PREMISE THAT FORMED OVER THE

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.199
YEARS. WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.034
CALIFORNIA FOR THESE YEARS AND

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.103
CERTAINLY SINCE THE SAN BRUNO

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.539
EXPLOSION BEEN CONDUCTING A

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:45.042
NATURAL A NATURAL EXPERIENCE IN

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.443
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.145
A SENSE IT IS A NATURAL

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:50.214
EXPERIMENT IN PRACTICE AND THAT

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:53.484
EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.619
A QUESTION AND SEEKING AN

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.588
ANSWER IN A SENSE TO A QUESTION

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.889
WHAT LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.691
SAFETY. CAN BE ACHIEVED THE

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:02.493
LINE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.061
RETROSPECTIVE FINES AND

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.163
PUNISHMENTS IN SAFETY. FOR

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.932
ACCIDENTS ON THE PART OF

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:10.367
UTILITIES THAT OWN AND MANAGE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.036
THE INFRASTRUCTURES. I THINK

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:13.337
OVER THE YEARS WE NOW HAVE

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:14.705
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO FORM A

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.574
CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS QUESTION

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.475
OF THE LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:21.011
SAFETY. AND THAT ANSWER IS IT

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:23.180
IS NOT ENOUGH AS A LEVEL OF

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.815
SAFETY TO APPROX APPROPRIATELY

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:27.218
SAFEGUARD THE CITIZENS OF THE

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:31.555
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOME FOLKS

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:34.124
BACK UP I WANT TO DESCRIBE WHAT

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:37.061
I THINK TO BE. AS WHAT I'VE

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:39.496
EXPERIENCED IT. THE FEATURES OF

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:44.268
THE CURRENT- CALIFORNIA SYSTEM.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.870
FIRST IT'S THE SYSTEM IS

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.671
CHARACTERIZED BY ADVERSARIAL

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:49.340
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:50.841
REGULATED UTILITIES THE

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.443
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:53.477
COMMISSION THE STATE

ACCIDENT BLAME SEEKING AND

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.487
CONDEMNATION DOMINATES THE

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.823
SYSTEM I BELIEVE AS OPPOSED TO

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.224
THE PROMOTION OF SAFETY AS A

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.959
PROSPECTIVE INTER

ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH BASED

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.897
AND POTENTIALLY COOPERATIVE

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:15.833
PROCESS. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.103
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SAFETY.

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.571
REGULATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:22.506
THEY DO HAVE COOPERATIVE JOINT

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.909
RESEARCH PROJECTS WE EVEN SEE

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:28.512
THIS IN THE FEDERAL SAFETY

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.481
AGENCIES LIKE THE FAA FOR

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:32.449
EXAMPLE WHICH IS HAD JOINT

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.818
PROJECTS TO IMPROVE COMMERCIAL

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:37.821
AVIATION SAFETY- BUT THIS

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.823
SYSTEM BASICALLY MAKES THAT

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.260
VERY DIFFICULT. AND IN FACT THE

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:45.062
REGULATORY AGENCIES THEMSELVES

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.497
THE PIERCING DOESN'T REALLY DO

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:48.966
ANY IN HOUSE REGULATION AND IS

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.601
INVOLVED IN JOINT RESEARCH.

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.303
PROJECTS WITH THE

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:53.470
INFRASTRUCTURES WITH OTHER

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.906
EXPERTS WITH OTHER

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:58.208
ORGANIZATIONS. CAREFUL FORWARD

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.643
LOOKING APPROACHES TO UTILITY

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.812
SAFETY ARE OVERWHELMED BY

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.214
SEARCH FOR FAST RESOLUTIONS AND

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.749
SOLUTIONS TO INCIDENTS AND

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:07.184
ACCIDENTS WE ARE SO EXCITED

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.787
DRIVEN. AND THE PRESS FOR A

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.989
SOLUTION OR RESOLUTION IS SO

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:14.091
POWERFUL THAT IN UTILITY

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:15.559
MANAGEMENT PEOPLE ARE JUST

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.761
LOOKING FOR A FIX IF THEY CAN

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:20.130
FIND IT AS FAST AS THEY CAN. IN

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:23.133
LAW WE SOMETIMES MAKE RULES OR

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.270
LAWS TO ADDRESS A PARTICULAR

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:28.038
FEATURE OF AN ACCIDENT AS

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.740
QUICKLY AS WE CAN BUT SOMETIMES

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.542
WE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:32.476
WHETHER THOSE LAWS WILL BE

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.178
EFFECTIVE WHETHER THEY CAN

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.980
ACTUALLY GAIN COMPLIANCE.

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.681
WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:40.317
CAPABILITY OF THE REGULATORY

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.085
AGENCY AGENCY TO ACTUALLY

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:45.222
ENFORCE THOSE LOS. IN THE

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.890
SEARCH FOR THESE SOLUTIONS AND

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:49.059
BLAME. COULD LOCATE BLAME AND

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.995
TO MAKE CORRECTIONS WE ARE ALSO

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.063
FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON LOCAL AND

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.565
PROXIMATE CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:56.233
AND INCIDENTS RATHER THAN ON

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.168
LONGER TERM SYSTEMIC OR ROOT

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.470
CAUSES I KNOW THAT THE

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.372
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. DID

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:03.907
TRY TO LOOK AT ROUTE COST GROUP

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.076
CLASSES BUT OFTEN TIMES WE

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:09.446
DON'T IN VARIOUS- PROCEEDINGS.

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.548
HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THATNOR DO

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.851
WE APPLY THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:16.587
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO IT

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.122
EFFECTIVELY. SO ALL OF THIS

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:20.324
MEANS IN MY VIEW THAT THE

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.426
SAFETY FOCUS IN. UTILITY

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.661
MANAGEMENT IN REGULATION AND

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:28.032
EVEN IN LAW RUNS UNFORTUNATELY

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.500
ONE ACCIDENT AT LEAST OR

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:30.667
INCIDENT BEHIND CURRENT

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:33.303
CONDITIONS CHALLENGES AND

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:33.704
OPERATIONS IN THE

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.539
INFRASTRUCTURE. ANOTHER WAY TO

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:37.975
PUT THIS IS. THE CURRENT

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.576
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM AND WE

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:42.379
SHOULD THINK OF IT AS A SYSTEM

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:42.980
AND NOT JUST LOOK AT YOU OF.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:46.517
ORGANIZATIONS AGENCIES FOUR

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:49.019
PIECES OF IT. THE CURRENT

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:49.887
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM IS

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:52.056
PRODUCING FAR LESS SAFETY

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.791
PROMOTION AND EFFECTIVE

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.492
REGULATION THAT THE LEVEL OF

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.327
DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT OF

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:59.830
ITS PARTICIPANTS. AND I HAVE

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:02.032
SEEN THIS IN MY WORK WITHIN THE

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.600
INFRASTRUCTURES I HAVE

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:06.070
INTERVIEWED PEOPLE AT ALL

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.237
LEVELS AND ACROSS DEPARTMENTS

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:08.772
AND I'VE SEEN IT ALSO IN THE

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.340
TIME I'VE SPENT IN THE PUBLIC

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:12.743
UTILITY COMMISSION AS WELL IN

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.511
LOOKING AT THEIR OPERATIONS.

00:45:14.578 --> 00:45:16.313
MANY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS IN

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.282
THE UTILITIES THE PC AND THE

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.217
LEGISLATURE ARE DEEPLY

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.419
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY KNOW

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:24.154
THEY SHOULD BE ACHIEVING BETTER

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.190
RESULTS THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.926
BETTER RESULTS THEY ARE. ARE

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.627
CONSTRAINED IN THE PRODUCTION

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:34.131
OF THOSE RESULTS I THINK IN

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:36.433
ADDITION TO THE ISSUE OF SAFETY

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.502
THE LARGER THIS IS A LARGER

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.070
FAILURE OF THE CURRENT

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:44.575
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM. TO UTILIZE.

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:47.511
HUMAN CAPACITY. THE SYSTEM

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:51.415
WASTE HUMAN CAPACITY. AND I

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.784
HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPECIFIC

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.353
DEFICIENCIES I COULD IDENTIFY I

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.754
DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO THAT NOW

00:45:57.821 --> 00:45:59.523
BUT IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS I

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.958
HAVE ADDITIONAL SLIDES THAT

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:02.659
MIGHT ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:04.761
PARTICULAR DEFICIENCIES IN

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.396
SAFETY MANAGEMENT RISK

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.832
ASSESSMENT IT SEEMS TO ME AS A

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:11.001
PIPE IN THE UTILITIES AS WELL

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:13.704
AS THE PC AND THE DILEMMA OF

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.372
TRYING TO PROMOTE SAFETY

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.207
CULTURE IN ORGANIZATIONS. NOT

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:19.476
TO BE ENTIRELY NEGATIVE I DO

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.311
WANT TO OFFER US SET UP

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.046
SUGGESTIONS ARE REALLY ONE BIG

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.582
SUGGESTION THE FIRST IS THE

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.317
MAJOR ONE IS LET'S CONSIDER THE

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:28.418
PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENT

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.920
CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.855
SAFETY SYSTEM TO BE AN

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:34.925
IMPORTANT AND URGENT SYSTEM

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:36.927
PROBLEM. THAT FOCUS ONE

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.729
INSTITUTION OR ORGANIZATION

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:42.866
ALONE. I BELIEVE THIS CURRENT

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.668
FUNCTIONING OF THIS SYSTEM.

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.036
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IS

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:47.437
WORTH THE PERHAPS OF A

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:49.806
STATEWIDE TASK FORCE. TO MORE

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:51.808
CAREFULLY UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.810
DEFICIENCIES IN THE ROOTS AS

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:55.412
WELL AS TO DEVELOP A WIDER

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.114
RANGE OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:59.149
THAT. COULD BE SEEN BY ANY OF

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.485
THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:04.054
AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. A

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:04.888
STATEWIDE TASK FORCE WOULD

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:07.157
ALLOW US TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:08.525
WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THE SAFETY

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:11.161
SYSTEM FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONAL

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:13.597
PERSPECTIVES. THEIR VIEWS OF

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.499
ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:17.367
THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THEIR

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.870
FRUSTRATIONS IN THE SYSTEM. IT

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.605
SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.307
FRAMEWORK OF A TASK FORCE WE

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:25.142
COULD BEGIN THE CONSIDER WHAT

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:28.212
ARE THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:28.712
FOR SAFETY PROMOTION AND

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.547
REGULATION THERE ARE A WHOLE

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.049
VARIETY OF THEM ONE OF THEM IS

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:33.684
ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ALL

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.552
OF THE WELL MANAGED

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:36.119
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.955
LOOKED AT. ALWAYS ARE ASKING

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.556
QUESTIONS. WHAT HAVE WE LEFT

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:42.726
OUT. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATIONS

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.895
WHAT WE SUE ME WE NEED TO HAVE

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.129
PEOPLE WHO CAN ASK THOSE

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:49.633
QUESTIONS. IN ALL OF THE

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.635
INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO FOR

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.871
ACROSS THE INSTITUTIONS. SO IF

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.206
THE REGULATION IS DEVELOPED BY

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.908
THE PEW SEAT HAS TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.276
WHAT ARE THE LIKELY RESPONSES

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:01.511
OF THE UTILITIES TO DOING THIS

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:02.412
WATER THEIR CAPACITIES TO

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:04.314
COMPLY. SAFETY RESEARCH AND

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:05.816
ANALYSIS WE REALLY HAVE TO

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:08.085
UPGRADE OUR GAME IN ACTUALLY

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.586
DOING RESEARCH THE LATEST

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.121
RESEARCH ON SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:13.357
SAFETY CULTURE AND THINKING

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:16.860
ABOUT METRICS TO MEASURE SAFETY

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.929
CULTURE PROGRESS IT'S A VERY

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.030
DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:22.132
REGULATORS TO PROMOTE AND

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.700
MONITOR AND OVERSEE THE

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.269
DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY CULTURE.

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:26.670
REGULATION AND RULE MAKING

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.171
WHERE CAN WE LOCATE THIS THE

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:30.907
CPC HAS A WHOLE VARIETY OF

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.843
REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.945
MANY OF WHICH ARE AND OTHER

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:36.513
MISSIONS SOME OF WHICH DON'T

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.949
HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH SAFETY

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:41.418
DIRECTLY. ACCIDENT AND INCIDENT

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.919
INVESTIGATIONS MAYBE WE COULD

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:43.787
HAVE THE SAFETY BOARD

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.856
EQUIVALENT TO THE N. T. S. B.

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.424
THAT COULD INDEPENDENTLY AND

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:49.660
WITH EXPERTISE AND WITH GREAT

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:51.595
RESPECT IN THE STATE. UNDERTAKE

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:54.064
THESE INVESTIGATIONS INSPECTION

00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:56.333
AND ENFORCEMENT. PRACTICES IN

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.635
COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW THE CPUC

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.003
IS DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM OF

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.571
AN INTEREST OF THE SAFETY

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.507
CULTURE DEVELOPMENT. IN P.

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:06.109
JEANNIE IT HAS NOWHERE NEAR THE

INSPECTION FORCE. IT HAS THEY

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:10.280
DID NOT THEMSELVES HAVE THE

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.249
TRAINING TO ACTUALLY.

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.484
UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:16.086
SAFETY CULTURE AND KEEP TRACK

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:18.155
OF IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:32.369
OF SAFETY IN THE AGENCIES. ARE

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:35.605
IN. IN THE REGULATORY AGENCIES

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:39.309
AND IN THE INFRASTRUCTURES. SO

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:41.411
AND LASTLY MAYBE WE SHOULD

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.046
THINK ABOUT IN A STATEWIDE TASK

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.448
FORCE FINDING A HOME FOR

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.683

INTERCONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.854
RISK. RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.422
REGULATING FOR INTERCONNECTED

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:54.391
INFRASTRUCTURE RISK. THE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.026
UTILITIES ARE NOT DOING RISK

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.494
ASSESSMENTS THAT CONSIDER INTER

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.196
ASSET LET ALONE ENTER

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:02.566
INFRASTRUCTURE RISKS. WE NEED

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.768
TO TAKE THIS ON. A FEW YEARS

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:06.303
AGO WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.871

INFRASTRUCTURE RISK HE LOOKED

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:20.317

RECOMMENDATIONS. FROM THE SAN

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:47.037
BRUNO EXPLOSION HAVE BEEN

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.706

P. JEANNIE AND- THE CPUC ASKING

00:51:57.747 --> 00:51:59.516
FOR SPIKE TESS. FOLLOWED BY

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.017
HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TESTS ON

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.552
LINES WHERE THE MAXIMUM

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.855
ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:07.591
COULDN'T BE DETERMINED. I TO

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.692
GET US UP TO SPEED COULD YOU

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.260
TELL US WHY- THESE

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.128
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL OPEN

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:14.664
AS YOU KNOW THEM AND THE IDEA I

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:15.999
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.868
LOOKING AT THE SOME OF THE

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:18.735
LETTERS AND RESPONSES THAT

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.537
THERE WAS A AN ACCEPTABLE

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.372
RESPONSE PROVIDED BY P. JEANNIE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.741
AND THE CPUC OVER THOSE TWO

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.244
ISSUES. DO YOU HAVE A THE SOME

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.179
PRETTY CLEAR INFORMATION YOU

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:30.881
CAN SHARE WITH THAT OF IT ALL.

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:33.950
CERTAINLY THOSE PARTICULAR

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.720
RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRED- THAT

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:41.258
PG&amp;E GO AND RETEST. MANY OF

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:43.693
THEIR LINES TO REALLY ESTABLISH

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.830
WHAT THE- OF. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.365
WORKING PRESSURE SHOULD DATE.

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:51.234
AND PG&amp;E HAS DILIGENTLY GONE

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.703
AFTER THAT THEY'VE GONE AFTER

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.839
THE BIGGEST SEGMENTS FIRST- AND

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.807
AT THIS POINT THEY'VE COMPLETED

00:52:57.874 --> 00:53:00.744
IT. ALMOST ALL OF THEIR WORK.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.078
BUT THERE ARE SOME SMALL

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.180
SEGMENTS THAT STILL NEED TO BE

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:07.117
TESTED- THAT ARE SOME OF THE

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.885
MOST DIFFICULT TO TEST. AND

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:11.421
IT'S BEEN OUR- DECISION TO KEEP

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:13.857
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OPEN. AND

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.359
TOLD EVERY LAST PIECE OF PIPE.

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:19.095
IS EITHER TESTED OR REPLACED.

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:23.366
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW I'M PLEASED.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.000
WITH THE PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE-

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.001
YOU KNOW COMPLETED ALMOST ALL

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.836
OF THEIR SYSTEM THERE ARE THESE

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.838
SMALL AREAS THAT STILL HAVE YET

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.574
TO BE DONE AND WE WILL KEEP THE

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.542
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OPEN UNTIL

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:35.545
WE CAN BE TOLD THAT EVERY LAST

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:37.314
START SEGMENT HAS BEEN TESTED.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.649
IF I UNDERSTAND IT IN- THE

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:42.285
STATUS REPORT IN AUGUST OF

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:42.852
TWENTY FOURTEEN STATED THAT

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:45.155
THE- THAT THEY NOTED THAT PG&amp;E

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:45.989
ESTIMATED THAT THOSE

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.324
RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.758
COMPLETED BY TOWARD BE

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.627
COMPLETED BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:52.262
THIS OBVIOUSLY WERE. STILL

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:55.999
THREE YEARS BEHIND THAT AND-

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.901
AND SO IS THAT THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.235
THAT'S STILL THE CASE THAT-

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.037
FROM WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.539
HEARD AND I KNOW SOME OF THOSE

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:03.873
LINES AND ESPECIALLY THE

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.009
ARGUMENT I REMEMBER FONG ONE

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.577
THIRTY TWO IN SAN BRUNO. TO WHY

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.379
THEY COULDN'T OTHER THAN THE

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:10.814
COST WAS THAT THEY COULD NOT

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.616
PICK THOSE LINES TO ACTUALLY

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:15.085
GET IN AND LOOK AT THOSE-

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.152
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLES AND SOME

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.954
OF THE CHALLENGES THERE AND I'M

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.522
ASSUMING THAT STILL.

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.790
APPROPRIATE ELSEWHERE AND

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:21.625
THAT'S WHAT SOME OF THE

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:23.360
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING- YOU

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.295
ALSO MENTIONED AND THAT THE

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:27.163
NTSB RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AROSE

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.098
FROM THE EXPLOSIONS THAT

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.966
OCCURRED TWO YEARS AGO IN

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:32.636
MASSACHUSETTS- CAN YOU PROVIDE

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.938
A BIT MORE DETAIL ON WHAT YOU

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.207
WERE REPORT FOUND REGARDING THE

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:39.509
LACK OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.678
APPROVING NATURAL GAS PROJECTS

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.013
THAT. YOU MENTIONED. EARLIER

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.547
THAT NTSB SENT A LETTER TO THE

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:47.584
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:48.785
NINETEEN ASKING US TO ADOPT

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.253
THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT YOU'RE

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.921
STILL AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:56.993
THAT THAT LETTERS I GUESS I'M.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.362
CONCERNED OF. ONE THE- OR THE

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.530
UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:02.932
ENGINEERS. THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:04.000
THAT I GUESS THAT'S THE

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:06.436
OBVIOUS- MIGHT BE BUT IT'S WHAT

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.339
YOU FOUND IN THAT CASE AND- AND

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.041
HAVE YOU STILL NOT RECEIVE THAT

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:13.810
RESPONSE FROM CALIFORNIA. AS

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.578
FAR AS I KNOW WE STILL HAVE NOT

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.547
RECEIVED A RESPONSE BUT- WHAT

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:21.084
WE FOUND IS THE REVIEWS CYCLE

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.720
FOR. THE DRAWINGS AND

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:27.290
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PROJECT

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:29.025
IN MASSACHUSETTS WHICH WAS A

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:31.194
CAST IRON REPLACEMENT PROJECT

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.130
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT. IS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:36.066
OCCURRING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:38.501
THE REVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:41.404
WERE PRIMARILY FINANCIAL. AND

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.807
NOT SAFETY REVIEWS AND THE

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:46.309
SENIOR MANAGERS THAT SIGNED OFF

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:47.610
ALTHOUGH THEY HAD PROFESSIONAL

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:50.013
ENGINEER'S LICENSES THEY WERE

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.515
REALLY ONLY CONDUCTING A

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:54.551
FINANCIAL REVIEW OF THE

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:57.220
PROJECTS AND IN FACT THE LEVEL

00:55:57.287 --> 00:56:02.225
AT WHICH PROJECTS GOT SIGNEDOFF ON WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.494
COST OF THE PROJECT. ONE OF THE

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.930
THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT THIS

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:10.567
RECOMMENDATION WITH AP STAMP AN

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:13.870
APPROVAL ON PLANS AND DRAWINGS

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.538
THERE IS A PERSONAL

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:18.274
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ENGINEER

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:21.077
THAT SIGNS THOSE PLANS SIGNS

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:22.912
THOSE DRAWINGS IS PERSONALLY

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.615
ATTESTING TO THE SAFETY OF HIS

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.851
WORK. AND WE FELT THAT THAT

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.886
ACCOUNTABILITY WAS MISSING IN

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.921
THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THESE

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:34.057
PROJECTS WERE BEING RUN AND

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.659
HOW- UTILITIES WERE HANDLING

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:39.395
THESE PROJECTS- WE INITIALLY

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.498
MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:42.966
MASSACHUSETTS TO DO THAT BUT

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.868
THEN DID FURTHER RESEARCH AND

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.069
FOUND THAT THIRTY ONE STATES

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.605
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EXEMPTED

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.440
UTILITIES FROM THIS REQUIREMENT

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:53.643
OF HAVING A P. E. C. O. PLANS

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.380
AND DRAWINGS- SO WE MADE THAT

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:59.616
RECOMMENDATION ACROSS-

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:02.819
NATIONALLY AND WE'RE STILL

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:04.387
WAITING ON RESPONSES FROM SOME

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:06.156
OF THE STATE'S CALIFORNIA BEING

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.791
ONE OF THEM AND THANK YOU TO

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:10.126
ALL AND- I HOPE THE CPUC WHEN

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.795
THEY TESTIFY IN THE PAST SECOND

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.196
PANEL WILL BE PREPARED TO.

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:16.566
ANSWER WHY THESTATE HAS YET TO

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:19.402
RESPOND TO THAT RECOMMENDATION-

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:19.969
AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.871
TESTIMONY TODAY NOW WILL GO ON

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.776
TEAM INVOLVED AS YOU MENTIONED

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:28.178
ON THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:30.079
OF EXPERTS INVESTIGATING THE

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:32.482
SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION. THAT

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.483
RESEARCH REPORTS BEEN EQUAL

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.652
FOCUS ON THE UTILITY AS IT DID

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:38.288
ON ITS REGULATOR THE CQC AND

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.924
ASIF USUALLY FOCUS WAS NOT JUST

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.826
WANTED PROVIDING MORE OVERSIGHT

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.861
BUT THAT THE CQC HAD CULTURAL

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.563
AND ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES THAT

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.531
NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. YOU'RE

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.333
FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPER BUT NO

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.836
WILL BEGINNING HIS EASY

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:57.240
CONTINUING. HIS HARD. WHAT OF

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:59.609
THE- FROM SAN BRUNO HAVE BEEN

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:00.944
TO. IN IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.179
WHERE DO FUTURE TRAPS OF LIFE

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:08.351
IN THAT. BOTH THE THAT'S THAT'S

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.420
A TOUGH QUESTION THE CREDIT

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:22.599
PRECIADO IT. THE I THE GREATEST

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:27.537
CHALLENGES- MOVING FORWARD. ARE

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:33.776
ARE IN THE AREA OF. I GUESS I

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.778
WOULD I WOULD SEE IT SUSTAIN

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:37.981
SUSTAINING THE WORK THAT IS

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:40.049
BEING DONE AT THAT HAS BEEN

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:43.720
DONE- AS IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT.

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.722
WE'RE DOING OR WE'RE DOING MORE

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:48.224
WITH LESS PEOPLE- AND

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:52.328
THEREFORE- PEOPLE'S EFFORTS.

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:55.031
CAN TEND TO REGRESS TO THE

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:58.301
MOMENT- AND NOT MAINTAIN THE

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:02.972
LONG TERM VIEW- I LOOK AT IT

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.841
FAIRLY SIMPLY AND AT WHEN I

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.576
LOOK AT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:09.245
AND SO ON AND I SAY TO MYSELF

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.614
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT MY- MY

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:15.251
GRANDCHILDREN OR MY- MY

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.254
DAUGHTER MY GRANDMOTHER. LIVING

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:20.990
NEXT TO THIS THIS THIS THIS

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.726
THIS CAR. INFRASTRUCTURE GOING

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:27.297
INTO THE GROUND- SO THE ROOTS

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:30.466
THE CHALLENGE IS AS A I USE THE

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:34.637
WORD MINDFUL IT'S BEING. A

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.906
MITIGATING DISTRACTIONS THAT

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.574
ARE AROUND WHETHER IT BE

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:42.578
TELEPHONES AND SO FORTH- AND

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:44.380
LIKEWISE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:46.249
SAFETY TAKING A MILITARY

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:49.686
APPROACH IS YOU'RE LOOKING OUT

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.254
FOR THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.189
THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:58.328
THAT THAT YOU'RE ABLE. TO

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:02.498
WITHOUT FEAR OF RETRIBUTION BOB

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:04.901
POINT OUT WHERE SOMEONE IS NOT

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:07.236
FOLLOWING THE OF THE PROCEDURE

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:10.606
DOCUMENTING THESE NEAR MISSES

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:14.077
THAT- THAT ARE REALLY A LEADING

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:17.347
INDICATOR OF MORE SYSTEMIC

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.649
PROBLEMS SO I THOSE ARE SOME

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.650
AREAS THAT I THINK REALLY ARE

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:25.421
THE CHALLENGE OF FOR JUST IT IT

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:28.691
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE. AND S. AND-

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.793
MAKING THEM BE ABLE TO SUCCEED

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.930
IN THEIR- IN THE WORK THAT THEY

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.499
DO. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I READ

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:37.734
ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.068
MISTER PELION AND I KNOW

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.637
SENATOR STERN HAS A QUESTION-

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.206
HE I'VE ALSO HEARD YOU

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.240
DISCUSSED IN IN PAST

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.908
PRESENTATIONS HOW THE SHARING

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.211
OF LESSONS LEARNED IS AN- IS AN

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.013
IDENTIFIED GAP ACROSS THE

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.180
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:53.282
INDUSTRY. AND EVEN SOMETIMES

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.650
ACROSS THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS OF

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.652
A CORPORATION AND IT'S BEEN MY

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.488
OPINION AND AS WE'VE WATCHED

01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.022
OVER THE YEARS P. JEANNIE

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.324
LEARNED. AND REALLY THE I THINK

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:02.625
A GOOD JOB IN MANY AREAS OF

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.727
IMPLEMENTING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.596
FROM THE SAN BRUNO IN ITS GAS

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.164
DIVISIONS BUT THOSE LESSONS

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.333
WEREN'T SHARED ADEQUATELY WITH

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.667
ITS ELECTRIC DIVISION AS WE'VE

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:12.935
SEEN IN UNFORTUNATELY

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.438
CALIFORNIA HAS PAID A HIGH AND

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.240
PAINFUL PRICE FOR THAT. WHAT

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.775
ARE YOUR WHAT ARE STRATEGIES OR

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.676
TOOLS THAT REGULATORS CAN USE

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.612
TO ENSURE PROMOTION OF SAFETY

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.514
SO THAT IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO BOTH

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:28.718
INTERNAL. AND EXTERNAL

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:33.823
STAKEHOLDERS. I THINK THE MOST

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.392
TO TWO POINTS ONE IS LIKE I

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.661
TALK ABOUT TRUST HI A TALK

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.496
ABOUT THE END ABOUT A

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:44.667
COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. IT

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:48.137
PROVIDING AN OPEN DISCUSSION.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.406
IT'S ESSENTIAL BETWEEN IT

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.241
WHETHER BETWEEN ALL THE

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.210
STAKEHOLDERS THE REGULATORS THE

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.312
PIPELINE OPERATORS THE

01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:03.186
CONTRACTORS- AND AT THEN AGAIN

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:07.924
A SYSTEM PROCESS. WITHIN THE

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:11.127
WORK TO SHARE THOSE LESSONS-

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.429
YOU KNOW WE DO WITNESSING YEAH

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:16.199
SKINNER. P. GENIES AN EXAMPLE

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.567
WHERE THEY HAVE NUMEROUS

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:20.336
DIVISIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:23.706
THE OF THE- OF THE STATE AND

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:26.576
THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY AND-

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:29.212
YOU KNOW SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.514
IN ONE AREA. YOU KNOW FIND ONE

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.583
KIND OF DEFECT AND IT BECOMES

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.985
TRIBAL AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE SO

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:39.522
IN ORDER TO EXPAND THAT- IT

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.624
TAKES A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.159
PROCESSES BUT IT BOILS DOWN TO

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.162
BEING- BEING TO OPEN

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:47.497
FACILITATING THAT THAT

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.466
EXCHANGE. BOTH INTERNALLY AND

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:53.536
EXTERNALLY AND- AND RECOGNIZING

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.238
THAT THERE IS A SYMBIOTIC

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.673
NATURE BETWEEN REGULATION

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.775
REGULATORS THE OVERSIGHT. AT

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.811
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BRINGING

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.713
THEIR EXPERIENCE FROM MULTIPLE

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:07.850
OUR- OPERATORS TO. THE

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:10.453
INDIVIDUAL OPERATOR SO. I THINK

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.322
FOSTERING THAT THAT THAT THAT-

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.291
EXCHANGE IS IMPORTANT VERY GOOD

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.093
THANK YOU REVEALING NOW GO TO A

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.230
SENATOR STERN. YOU HAD A

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:21.998
QUESTION THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:22.932
YEAH JUST VERY BRIEFLY THANK

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:23.666
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.134
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY I

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.503
DON'T OF- YOU YOU'VE DUG IN

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.771
PRETTY THOROUGHLY HERE I JUST I

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.940
DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ONE TO

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.375
TWO PARTICULAR ITEMS I WAS

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.410
INTERESTED IN THE- ASK FORCE

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.245
RECOMMENDATION FROM DR SHOWMAN

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.347
AND HOW. YOU SEE THAT

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:41.250
INTERFACING- WITH THE CURRENT

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:44.253
RISK BASED. RATEMAKING PROCESS

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.757
THROUGH THE S. MAP AND RAMPS-

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.859
PROCESS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.127
THAT'S WHAT A TASK FORCE

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.095
CONCEPT- INTERFACING WITH THE

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.030
SORT OF CURRENT PUBLIC

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.098
UTILITIES COMMISSION PROCESS

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:59.168
AND I THINK ONE OF THE

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.338
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT. D.

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:05.341
AS I RECALL FROM THE LOOK.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:09.145
PANEL WAS FOR- AT THE

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:12.381
INVOLVEMENT OF THE OF THIS C.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:16.219
P. UC'S SAFETY ARM IN IN RATE

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:19.722
CASES- WHICH IN IN THE PAST

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:23.392
THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN. AND

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.595
EXPERIENCE WERE YOU KNOW DEVOID

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:28.397
IN THAT PROCESS- I'M NOT OVERLY

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.199
AND TO BE QUITE HONEST I'M NOT

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.736
OVERLY FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:37.607
DIDN'T WHAT WHAT THE- RAMPS AND

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:41.644
THE OTHER IS. NOT AND THAT'S

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.912
ALL RIGHT I. DIFFERENT QUESTION

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:44.413
FOR YOU MIND THAT THAT FIRST

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.147
COURSE WAS MORE FOR DOCTOR

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.883
SHAMAN BECAUSE I SAW IN- YOUR

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.387
REMARKS DR SHOWMAN ABOUT THIS

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:54.690
TASK FORCE CONCEPT. AND MAYBE

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:55.691
THE INTERFACE WITH THE CURRENT.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:59.895
RIGHT J. KENNEDY CAN YOU HEAR

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:02.765
ME YES OKAY RIGHT I'VE BEEN

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.734
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THAT UP

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.304
PROCESS OF RELATIVELY CLOSELY-

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.239
AND I HAVE SOME ROOM I THINK IT

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:11.440
TASK FORCE NEEDS TO LOOK AT

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.709
THIS THIS PROCESS MORE

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:16.879
CAREFULLY- AS YOU MAY KNOW THE

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.782
P. C. HAS ITSELF- ENDORSED A

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:22.251
PARTICULAR APPROACH TO DOING

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:25.721
RISK ASSESSMENTS. BY THE

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.057
UTILITIES. A MULTI ATTRIBUTE

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.626
VALUATION FUNCTION MESSAGE OUR

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.261
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ALLOW

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:33.529
THE UTILITIES TO ACTUALLY

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.032
COMPUTE RISK SPEND DEFICIENCIES

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:41.671
DOWN TO A YEARLY. NUMBER OF.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.407
FRACTIONS OF SAFE. OF SERIOUS

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:46.409
INJURIES OR FATALITIES PER YEAR

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.577
SAVED BY CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.146
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THOSE

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:52.415
ARE THOSE ASSESSMENTS DO NOT

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:56.085
USE HUMAN AND ORGANIZATIONAL

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.220
AND MANAGEMENT VERY BOOKS THERE

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.555
ARE TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY AND

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.790
NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL'S

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.625
JUST COME DOWN REALLY HARD IN A

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.160
STATEMENT ABOUT RISK

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.728
ASSESSMENTS THAT DO NOT

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.396
CHARACTERIZE THEIR UNCERTAINTY.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.798
THAT OFFER SINGLE VALUE

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.833
STATEMENTS AND NUMBERS WITHOUT

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.468
REALIZING OR WITHOUT EVEN

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.570
ADDRESSING WHAT IS LEFT OUT IN

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.073
TERMS OF VARIABLES WHAT WHAT ON

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.375
YOUR- WHAT IT REAL ON

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:20.443
RELIABILITY THERE MIGHT BE IN

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:23.145
THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THEMSELVES

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.447
WELL THIS IT SEEMS TO ME IS

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.216
THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR THOSE

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.485
EFFORTS. TO RATIONALIZE IF YOU

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.153
WILL THE SAFETY INVESTMENT

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.155
PROCESS. IN THE RAPE CASES

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.291
ULTIMATELY FIRST AND THEN YOU

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.926
NEED A FIGHT IF I COULD SAY

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.761
ABSENCE MAKES. PUT IT MORE

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:43.966
SIMPLY. TO QUANTITATIVE IN TECH

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:48.471
OF MATCH NOT QUALITY. AND HUMAN.

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.205
I THINK THAT BE MORE

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.440
QUANTITATIVE BUT WITH A RANGE

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.109
OF ESTIMATES AND ADDING MORE

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:56.412
VARIABLES ON SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.314
A FALSE PRECISION IS CONVEYED

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:02.218
ABOUT THE ACTUAL. FIRE IS ATION

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.886
OF RISKS WITH RESPECT TO

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.021
INVESTMENTS MADE AND SELL

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.957
INVESTMENTS WILL BE MADE WHICH

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.692
WILL NOT YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.026
THE OUTCOME WILL BE YOU CAN

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.428
TALK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT OUT

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.929
REPLACING A PIPELINE FOR

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.965
EXAMPLE BUT IF THE INSPIRED BY

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:18.334
ISN'T EXPECTED. IF IT'S NOT

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.803
MAINTAINED IF IT'S NOT OPERATED

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.805
WITHIN ACCEPTABLE PRESSURES AND

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.408
TEMPERATURES THEN YOU DON'T GET

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.077
THAT RISK MITIGATION OUT OF IT

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.379
AND RIGHT NOW THE P. YOU SEE IS

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.348
NOT IN POSITION TO ESTIMATE THE

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:35.050
SAFETY MANAGEMENT CAPACITY.

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:38.554
SURROUNDING THESE HARD HARDWARE

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.823
INVESTMENTS THAT IS TRYING TO

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.624
GET SO I THINK THIS IS A REAL

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.692
ISSUE AND IT'S A PRACTICAL

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.727
ISSUE I'M I KNOW I'M RAMBLING

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.263
ON HERE NO NO TELL ME BUT IT

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.164
WAS NOT ONLY THE NATIONAL

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:51.300
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES BUT SOCIETY

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:52.868
FOR RISK ANALYSIS HAS ALSO.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:55.471
COME DOWN ON THE FAILURE

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:56.338
FAILURE TO CHARACTERIZE

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.607
UNCERTAINTIES IF THE STATE IF

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.776
THE PSC WERE TO ACTUALLY MAKE

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:04.180
A- CORRECT CASE DECISION WHICH

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.415
ALLOWED THE UTILITIES TO INVEST

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.017
IN SOMETHING AND GAIN

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.618
COMPENSATION THROUGH RATES.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.153
THEY WOULD BE VERY VULNERABLE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.188
TO COURT SUITS PEOPLE COULD

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.622
TAKE THEM TO COURT AND HAD

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.491
EXPERT WITNESSES FROM THE

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.426
NATIONAL ACADEMY OR FROM THE

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.061
SAFETY PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:21.597
THE SOCIETY FOR RISK ANALYSIS

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:22.598
IT'S JUST A VERY POOR

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.533
FOUNDATION. AND I THINK WE NEED

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.302
TO LOOK AT THIS PROCESS A LOT

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.270
MORE CAREFULLY AND WE NEED TO

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.706
ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.208
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SAFETY

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.910
CULTURE AS VARIABLES IN

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:35.411
ASSESSING RISK AND RISK

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.580
MITIGATION EXCELLENT THANK YOU

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.782
FOR THAT MY ONE OTHER QUESTION

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.450
AND WE FOCUSED A LOT. ON THIS

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:44.053
PANEL AND- IN GENERAL IT IS

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.054
PROCEEDING BACK TYPE LINE

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.123
SAFETY SPECIFICALLY- I HATE IT

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.425
IF IT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE I

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.527
UNDERSTANDBUT PART OF THAT THE

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.162
DISASTER AT LEAST CANYON WAS

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:58.501
ALSO ABOUT. STORAGE RIGHT

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.237
SAFETY OUR FENCE A IS NOT HERE

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.037
TODAY THE BETTER LEVEL AS WELL

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:05.941
AS PART ENERGY DID. ONCE EIGHT

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.042
DOT WAS LOOK TO ADOPT GAS

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.244
SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE STILL

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.812
MISTER STATE WHY BUT MINOR IS

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.414
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. ROLLED

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.250
BACK MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS TO

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.018
PROMULGATE GUIDELINES IN THE

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.654
REGULATIONS. ANY COMMENTS I

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:19.822
DIDN'T KNOW IF ANY OF OUR

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:20.923
PANELISTS WERE FOLLOWING UP

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.293
LIKE DOES THAT LACTOSE. FEDERAL

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.562
OVERSIGHT INACTION LEADS OUR

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:31.033
STATE MORE VULNERABLE. THIS IS

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.671
AYE AS I RECALL- FILMS- ISSUED

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:41.076
AN EMERGENCY. I'LL SAY ORDER.

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:46.115
THAT THAT THAT. THAT THAT

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.883
CALLED FORTH FOR STORAGE

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:51.620
OPERATORS TO ADOPT ERTAIN-

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:54.423
ANSI STANDARDS AS IT RELATES TO

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.991
YOU KNOW THE WELL THE WELL THE

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:58.160
WELL IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.528
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WAS AND

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.196
THAT THE YOU KNOW THE WAY

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:03.165
OPERATORS LOOK AT IT IS THAT'S

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:05.734
NOT PROMULGATED REGULATIONS SO

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:10.973
IT'S A IT'S A NICE TO HAVE. ADD

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.110
I THINK THOSE TWO. ARE YOU KNOW

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.045
OUR OUR OUR OUR GOOD I

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.813
ENCOURAGE. ALSO TO LOOK

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.848
INTERNATIONALLY- HIGH SO

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:26.589
STANDARDS- AND- IT ENDED UP

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:27.189
DON'T. YOU THINK CALIFORNIA'S

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:30.092
STORAGE INDEPENDENT OR ARE YOU.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.828
ARE HEADED TO KERR ON ON THAT

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.797
IS. THAT THE FEDERAL. IS

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.800
CRITICAL. I'M I CAN'T REALLY I

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:40.369
CAN'T TO ASSESS. I DON'T INTO

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.838
THE INDIVIDUALS OKAY WHILE

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.006
SAYING THAT ALSO FOR A FUTURE

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.474
PANEL I'M SURE THAT YOUR

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.042
UTILITIES AND PC MAY HAVE SOME

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.077
INSIGHT THERE AND YOU AND

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:49.445
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALL

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.913
CHANNELS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.615
THANK YOU SENATOR STERN THE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.717
REQUESTED FOR PROFESSOR SHERMAN

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.251
THE OF AND WE TALKED A LITTLE

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:58.387
BIT ABOUT- WITH THE TOOLS THAT

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.055
REGULATORS CAN USE TO ENCOURAGE

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.857
SAFETY FROM- THE ENTITIES THAT

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.392
THEY REGULATE THE- AND I KNOW

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.628
YOU STUDY THIS THIS IN DEPTH-

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:06.962
PERHAPS YOU CAN TOUCH AND WHAT

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.597
TOOLS. ARE USED IN OTHER

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.399
INDUSTRIES INDUSTRIES I KNOW

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.101
YOU'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND-

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.836
ON NUCLEAR THE IN NUCLEAR IN

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.638
INDUSTRY AND AERONAUTICS AND

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.272
HOW THEY HAVE DONE THIS AND HOW

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.074
THAT THAT DIFFERENCE THERE.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.943
THAT WE'VE SEEN I KNOW- OUR

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.478
REGULATORS ARE TYPICALLY LEFT

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:28.484
WITH FINES. OR AND CITATIONS.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.653
ANY OUT COMPLY. IN THIS HAD

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.254
MIXED. SO THOUGHTS PLAY YEAH

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.456
WHAT ONE DID. THIS EVAN TO ME

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.691
IS THAT BOTH THE NUCLEAR

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.192
REGULATORY COMMISSION AND THE

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:37.726
FEDERAL AVIATION

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.561
ADMINISTRATION. THEY DO

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.463
RESEARCH THEY ACTUALLY ARE

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.165
SOURCE OF RESEARCH THEMSELVES

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.233
AND THEY CONTRACT OUT

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:45.668
SPECIFICALLY FOR RESEARCH ON

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.269
SAFETY QUESTIONS. OF A

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.438
PROSPECTIVE NATURE NOT JUST THE

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:52.141
RETROSPECTIVE. NATURE AND I

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:53.876
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:55.511
REALLY DEFICIENT IN OUR

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.112
APPROACH IT'S A TOOL THAT IS

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:59.181
NOT IN THE CURRENT KIT OF THE

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.016
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. SO

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.518
THEY HAVE TO THEY MAY HAVE

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.720
HIRED. A CONSULTANT OR HAD THE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:07.089
UTILITY HIRING CONSULTANTS. BUT

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.324
THAT USUALLY IS IN THE CONFINES

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.492
OF NARAL CONFINES OF THE

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.161
PRECEDING ABOUT IN A SPECIFIC

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:16.899
ACCIDENT- THIS ISSUE OF SAFETY

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.467
METRICS. WE HAVE ANY THE CPS

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.670
DOES NOT HAVE THE INDICATORS.

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:24.106
IN IN ANY NEEDS TO HAVE METRICS

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.674
AND IT NEEDS TO WORK THOSE OUT

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.209
WITH UTILITIES THEMSELVES SO

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.178
THEY MAKE SENSE TO UTILISE IS A

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:29.912
LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.915
UTILITIES- ABOUT WHAT METRICS

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.683
WOULD MAKE SENSE WHAT WHAT

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.219
THINGS ARE LEADING INDICATORS

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.321
WITH RESPECT TO THE- ATIONS ARE

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:39.822
DEFICIENCIES IN SAFETY

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.791
MANAGEMENT- FOR THE LAPSES IN

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.627
SAFETY CULTURE. SO I THINK THAT

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.763
THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.131
PROCESS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.433
THEN AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.235
INSPECTION THE THIS PUBLIC

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.037
UTILITY COMMISSION IN THE STATE

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.705
DOES NOT HAVE THE INSPECTIONS

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.941
TOOL TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT IS A

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:05.547
VERY. COMPLICATED. LONG TERM UP

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.583
ON CERTAIN PROCESS OF

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:10.452
DEVELOPING SAFETY CULTURE. IT

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.955
IS AN UNCERTAIN JOURNEY AND

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.790
IT'S A CONSTANT JOURNEY AND IT

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:17.159
NEEDS THE P. C. NEEDS TO HAVE

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.194
AN INSPECTION FORCE OF PEOPLE

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:21.864
WHO CAN BE CONTINUALLY AROUND

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.832
THE PUBLIC THE NATIONAL NUCLEAR

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.200
REGULATORY COMMISSION HAS TO

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:27.035
RESIDENT INSPECTORS FOR EVERY

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.304
ONE OF ITS NUCLEAR PLANTS AND-

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.440
NUCLEAR PROCESSING PLANT STATED

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.509
OVERSEAS THERE THERE ALL THE

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.912
TIME- DID YOU SEE DOESN'T HAVE

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:37.813
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL BUT IT

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.982
NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.084
NOT PEOPLE. SO THEY CAN GO MEET

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.385
BE PART OF THE OPERATIONS WATCH

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:45.954
THEM IN REAL TIME TALK TO

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:49.424
PEOPLE- AND HAVE THE SKILLS AND

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:50.526
THE TRAINING TO KNOW WHAT TO

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.327
LOOK FOR IN CONNECTION WITH A

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:54.163
SAFETY CULTURE IN L. THOSE

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.931
ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S IN IN A

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.733
REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT IT

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.269
DOESN'T HAVE IN ITS KICK SO I

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:03.605
THINK THAT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.808
TWO THINGS THAT. OUR REALLY NO

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.177
GAPS IN OUR CURRENT APPROACHES.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.078
THE TO THE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN.

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.747
A JUDO AND YOU'VE HEARD ONE OF

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.815
THE TOOLS DISCUSSED WITH

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.650
CALIFORNIA UTILITIES HAS BEEN

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.518
THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVIZING.

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.054
SAFE PERFORMANCE BASED ON

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.856
CERTAIN AGREED METRICS THE- IT

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:22.991
RANGES FROM INCENTIVES TO PACK-

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.760
PACKAGES FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.395
OR TIME UTILITIES RATE OF

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.997
RETURN TO SAFETY. WHAT ARE THE

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.466
PITFALLS OF SUCH A TOOL TO BE

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.335
USED OF THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.204
AND THEY HAVE THEIR MANY. FIRST

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.705
OFF. ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.874
INTERESTING IS THE MOTIVATION

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:43.212
OF PEOPLE TO BE SAFE- PEOPLE

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:43.846
HAVE MOTIVATION OF THE TYPES.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.848
MANY OF THEM ARE. SOME OF THEM

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.049
ARE COERCIVE YOU'LL BE PUNISHED

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:51.687
IF YOU DON'T DO X. SOME OF THEM

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:52.988
ARE ON NORMATIVE. BEEN A GOOD

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:55.357
SAFETY CULTURE. PEOPLE HAVE AN

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:56.491
IDENTITY THEY HAVE A

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.060
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY AS

01:14:58.126 --> 01:15:00.028
PART OF WHO THEY ARE. WHEN YOU

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.064
TRY TO ADD INCENTIVES ON TOP OF

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.465
THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.300
ACTUALLY UNDERMINES THE SENSE

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:06.768
OF THEIR PERSONAL AND

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:07.536
PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY AS

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:09.838
SAFETY. PROFESSIONALS THE OTHER

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.773
SIDE OF COURSE IS WE DO HAVE

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.842
EVIDENCE THAT IF IT'S A HIGH

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:17.479
STAKE METRIC. WHERE HUGE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.747
FINANCIAL AMOUNTS ARE INVOLVED.

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.616
OR EVEN MAJOR PUNISHMENTS TO

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:23.151
THE METRIC PEOPLE WILL TRY TO

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.987
MANAGE TO THE METRIC OR DISTORT

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:27.589
THE METRIC. THAT THOSE ARE REAL

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.758
PITFALLS IF YOU CAN TAKE THE

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.261
CASE OF P. JEANNIE. I WROTE

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:33.629
SOME TESTIMONY AFTER THE

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.098
LOCATED MARC CASE POINTING OUT

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.233
WHAT A DRAMATIC CASE THAT WAS

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.369
TO SHOW. THE LACK OF A SAFETY

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:42.137
CULTURE IN THAT ORGANIZATION.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:46.208
IF YOU. IMPOSE BENEFITS. FOR

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:48.410
METRICS IN A SYSTEM THAT

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:49.778
DOESN'T HAVE SAFETY CULTURE

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:52.180
CONSTRAINTS. THEN I THINK YOU

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.849
RUN AT EVEN GREATER RISK OF

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:54.950
PEOPLE DISTORTING THEIR

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.551
BEHAVIOR TO LOOK GOOD TO THE

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:58.253
METRIC WHICH IS A WELL

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.689
UNDERSTOOD PHENOMENON IN A

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.624
VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS. THANK

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:07.663
YOU IT IN AND JUST ONE OTHER

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.264
QUESTION TO DIRECTOR HALL AND

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.966
THE MISTER P. ONLY DO YOU HAVE

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.768
ANY OTHER TOOLS THAT- FOR

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.036
SAFETY REGULATORS THAT YOU

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:23.278
MIGHT SUGGEST- BRIEFLY. THIS IS

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.280
CHRIS I THINK I WOULD I'D LIKE

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.249
TO POINT OUT. SOMETHING THAT

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.151
WAS RAISED WITH REGARD TO THE

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:31.720
RESEARCH ASPECTS OF IT AND OF

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.022
COURSE THAT- I'LL SAY FROM AN

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:35.657
INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE USED TO BE

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:39.695
DONE THROUGH- G. R. I. AND SO

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:40.595
FORTH WHEN IT WAS BEING FUNDED

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:44.900
BY. SURCHARGES A TRANSPORTATION

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:47.169
OR THE SALE OF GAS WELL ONE OF

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:48.804
THE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IT IS

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.305
REALLY OF INTEREST TO THAT MAY

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:53.241
BE OF INTEREST TO THE

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:56.511
LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING AT AT-

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:58.981
WHAT IS DONE IN THE U. K. AND

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:05.487
ESTABLISHING- AS PART OF. THERE

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.457
PERFORMANCE A SETTING UP A

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:11.893
RESEARCH POOL OF FUNDS SO FORTH

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.697
THAT. THAT THAT IT THAT IS A

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.799
COOPERATIVE- IN PROVIDING

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:21.036
FUNDING FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.071
AND IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:26.508
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THEN TIED

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:32.547
TO- YOU KNOW THE COMPANY'S

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:34.716
GREAT I'LL SAY THEY DON'T HAVE

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.283
RATED RATE OF RETURN IF YOU

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:41.023
WILL. SENSUALLY THAT THAT.

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:43.658
THERE THESE FUNDS ARE ESTABLISH

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.427
SUCH THAT OR THE POOL IS SET UP

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.162
THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN DO

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:50.732
THIS RESEARCH- AND IT'S I THINK

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.300
IT'S BEEN VERY IT HAS BEEN VERY

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:54.169
SUCCESSFUL I KNOW THAT THEY

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:56.304
DEVELOP ROBOT THAT THEY THEY

01:17:56.371 --> 01:18:01.443
IMPLEMENTED ROBOTIC. THE

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.011
SYSTEMS WITH REGARD TO CAST

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.514
IRON PIPE WHICH MITIGATE REDUCE

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.315
THE SIGNIFICANTLY THE COST OF

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:09.017
REPLACEMENT AND SO ON AND SO

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.118
FORTH AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.987
THANK CALIFORNIA WE DON'T THERE

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:13.255
IS AN CAST IRON IN THIS IS THAT

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:15.157
IT CERTAINLY DISTRIBUTION

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:18.560
ASPECT OF IT BUT- AGAIN OFF

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:21.830
JIM- THIS THIS APPROACH MIGHT

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:25.434
BE SOMETHING THAT COULD MAY BE

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.402
APPROPRIATE. FOR A- IN

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:31.106
CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA. GOOD

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.176
THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL DID YOU

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:40.215
HAVE A- COMMENT. ONE OF THE

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.216
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:43.652
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:44.386
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FROM THE

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:47.756
PRICING STANDPOINT. BUT RATES

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.192
SAT AND UTILITIES ARE PAID

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.561
BASED ON THEIR RATES AND THAT

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.763
THE PRICING TENDS TO BE HAVE

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.698
MORE POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:59.568
THAT- THE THOSE APPOINTED TO

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:02.771
THOSE BOARDS EXCEPT PRICES ARE.

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:03.839
VERY INTERESTED GIVING

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:06.908
CUSTOMERS THE LOWEST PRICE AND

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:09.444
WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST DECADE I

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.980
DECREASE IN THE RATE OF NATURAL

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.082
GAS THE COST OF NATURAL GAS

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:17.285
RATHER CONSIDERABLE. AND WE'VE

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:20.922
ALSO SEEN THATREGULATORS- WILL

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.557
TELL THIS THE PIPELINE

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:24.726
COMPANIES WELL IF THERE ISN'T A

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.963
REGULATION YOU CANNOT GET COST

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:28.763
REIMBURSED FOR IMPROVING

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:32.467
SAFETY. AND IT'S A DISINCENTIVE

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.035
FOR PIPELINE COMPANIES TO GO

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.438
BEYOND WHAT THE REGULATIONS

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.173
HAVE AND THAT THAT'S BEEN A

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.010
CONCERN- THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:44.179
AND THEN THE- REGULATION OF THE

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:46.915
PRICES AND THE COST

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:50.619
REIMBURSEMENT. THANK YOU ONE

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:51.820
FINAL QUESTION FOR THE PANEL

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:54.456
THAT- EVIL TOUCHED ON THE

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.357
IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.559
SAFETY AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.493
SYSTEM SAID DURING YOUR

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.162
TESTIMONY AND HOW ONE OF THE

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.763
MAIN NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS TO

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.598
ARISE OUT OF SAN BRUNO IS THE

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.667
SMS POLICY I THINK ONE OF THE

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:06.434
CHALLENGES IN HAVING A

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.303
CONVERSATION ABOUT SMS IS THE

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.239
VARIOUS MEANS OF MANAGEMENT AND

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.575
HOW THEY OVERLAP YOU CAN MANAGE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.677
AN ASSET AS IS THE CASE WITH

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.078
INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT WORK

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.747
MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE NTSB

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.682
AND OUR P. REPORTS BUT YOU CAN

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:23.018
ALSO MANAGE PEOPLE. IDEALLY THE

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.020
UTILITIES WILL DO BOTH WELL BUT

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.588
THE CAN YOU DISCUSS THE ROLE OF

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.390
SMS POLICIES AND THE ROLE THEY

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.824
SHOULD BE PLAYING AT THE

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:32.227
UTILITIES AND OF THE P. YOU SEE

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.195
HOW THE REGULATOR REGULATORS

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:36.431
SHOULD BE REVIEWING THESE

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:43.338
POLICIES. I COULD SAY A LITTLE

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:45.640
ABOUT THAT IN TWO RESPECTS. ONE

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:48.810
IS THERE'S AN INTERESTING. HEAD

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.011
OF RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:54.549
INDICATE THAT THE ABILITY OF

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:56.384
THE UTILITY TO DEVELOP A STRONG

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.587
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.855
RELATED TO THE POWERFUL TO THE

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.424
POWER OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.527
SYSTEM IN THE REGULATOR ITSELF

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:07.529
THAT SOMEHOW IT HELPS PEOPLE TO

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.731
BE SAFETY MANAGERS IN THE

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:12.200
UTILITY. IF PEOPLE IN THE

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.902
UTILITY RESPECT THE SAFETY

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.171
MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.506
REGULATING AGENCY ITSELF IS

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.542
ALSO TRUE ON THE OTHER HAND

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:24.879
THAT THE ABILITY OF A REGULATOR

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:27.249
TO ENFORCE VARIOUS REGULATIONS

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:28.883
DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.986
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.954
REGULATED ORGANIZATION SO

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.023
THERE'S A MUTUAL. CONNECTION

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.058
HERE BETWEEN BOTH BOTH OF THEM

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.060
NEED TO HAVE GOOD EFFECTIVE

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:42.330
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS- SO I

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.665
THINK THAT THAT'S KIND OF A

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.834
FINDING THAT WE'VE WE'VE COME

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.671
TO- IN LOOKING AT AT THOSE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:57.078
THOSE SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. OTHER

01:21:57.145 --> 01:22:02.384
THOUGHTS. AL JUST REPEAT WHAT

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:03.752
I'VE EVER REALLY SAID IT WITH

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:08.490
REGARD TO MANAGEMENT- AGAIN- IT

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:10.692
IS EXTREMELY IT IS BROAD

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.960
LOOKING AT THE INTERNAL INEC

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.062
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS ALL OF

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.264
THAT MANAGEMENT WHETHER YOU'RE

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:19.067
MANAGING THE CONTRACTORS- YOU

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.102
HAVE A YOU HAVE THE

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:22.170
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE-

WILL LOOK AT THAT- CLOSER AS WE

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:52.338
MOVE FORWARD. ANOTHER QUESTION

CONCLUDED IN. JANUARY OF THIS

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.357
YEAR RAISE THE ISSUES OF KIND

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.225
OF PERVERSE INCENTIVES WERE

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:28.361

INCENTIVES FOR SUPERVISORS WAS

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:36.235
A REDUCTION IN THE LAKE

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:38.871
TICKETS- IN IS WE KNOW WHAT

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:40.406
HAPPENED WITH THAT IF THE

THIS HEARING ALSO NOTES THAT P.

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:46.112
GENIES CURRENT. DIG IN AND STEP

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:47.914
METRIC CAN OBSCURE ACTUAL

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.882
SAFETY MEASUREMENTS AND MAY BE

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:53.085
EASILY CO OPTED. TO WHY IS THIS

01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:55.254
NUMBER OF BEGINS AND FOUR

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:56.556
THOUSAND TICKETS AN APPROPRIATE

01:59:56.622 --> 01:59:58.624
METRICS IT'S BEING USED AND

01:59:58.691 --> 01:59:59.859
DOES THIS RAISE ANY CONCERN

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:04.063
ABOUT. THE INCENTIVES CURRENTLY

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:05.431
IN PLACE. I THANK CHAIRMAN FOR

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:07.333
THE QUESTION. IN TERMS OF THE

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.602
INCENTIVE I'LL ADDRESS THAT

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:12.672
FIRST. THE DIRECTOR OF

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:13.673
ESTUDIANTES SPEAKING FOR

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:17.243
MYSELF- I AM NOT. IN FAVOR OF

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:18.144
THE CENTERS ARE I'LL BE UP

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:20.580
FRONT I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:24.183
WAS DR- PAUL NEWMAN FROM AND

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.551
THAT YOU KNOW POINTED OUT

02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:26.652
THERE'S A BIG FOSTER THAT ARE

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:27.653
DEFINITELY PROPOSED TO

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:31.357
INCENTIVIZING. SAFETY VIA A- A

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:34.193
MONETARY VALUE- SAFETY IS A

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.361
CULTURE AT THE STATE OF MIND

02:00:35.428 --> 02:00:36.429
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:41.167
LIVE WITH FOR AND YOU RESET AND

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:42.468
IT MIGHT BE FOR VARIOUS REASONS

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:44.236
BUT IT IS A CULTURE THAT YOU

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.405
HAVE TO HARNESS. AND FACILITATE

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:47.873
WITH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.910
ORGANIZATION AND AS SUCH YOU

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:52.878
NEED TO ENSURE AND THIS IS WHAT

02:00:52.945 --> 02:00:54.280
WE TRY TO DO WITH AN STD IT'S

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:56.215
FREE TRY TO DECIDE YOURSELF

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:57.316
STRUCTURE OUR DIFFERENT LINES

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:58.951
OF BUSINESS. JUST LIKE SOME THE

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:00.820
UTILITIES HAVE DONE OR SPEAKING

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.355
WITH EACH OTHER AND LEARNING

02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:03.155
THIS VALUABLE LESSONS FROM EACH

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.825
OTHER- WE DON'T HAVE AN

02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:09.128
INCENTIVE ON THE REGULATOR SIDE

02:01:09.195 --> 02:01:10.963
FOR ISSUE MORE CITATIONS ARE

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:13.399
FINDING MORE STUFF. THERE IS NO

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:15.434
INCENTIVE FOR THAT AND

02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:17.370
MONETARILY OR INCENTIVE AS WELL

02:01:17.436 --> 02:01:19.071
WE KNOW WHAT IF WE GO OUT THERE

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:20.573
AND FIND NOTHING. THAT'S A

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.241
GREAT DAY THAT'S A GREAT DAY

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:23.542
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE

02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:25.811
ACTUALLY ENFORCE THEIR DAY ARE

02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:27.113
LIVING UP TO SAFETY STANDARDS.

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:28.614
I MISS THE DAYS THAT WE DO FIND

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:30.216
SOMETHING THAT IS A CONCERNING

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:32.051
DAY AND ONLY SO THE QUESTION

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:34.053
DOES THE SAFETY CULTURE EXIST

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.521
WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION IS A

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:38.024
COMING FROM THE TOP DOWN. OR IS

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.458
IT STARTING AT THE BOTTOM

02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:40.893
WORKING ITS WAY HALF WAY UP AND

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.229
THEN SUDDENLY BEING STOPPED BY

02:01:43.295 --> 02:01:45.097
IN THIS CASE LOCAL MARKET USE

02:01:45.164 --> 02:01:54.740
YOUR EXAMPLE- AND INSTEAD WHERE.

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:55.541
SOMEBODY WAS TO YOU THAT FOR

02:01:55.608 --> 02:01:57.476
NOW AND TO. YOU KNOW MEET AND-

02:01:57.543 --> 02:01:58.744
ON THAT'S WHAT LED TO THE BY.

02:01:58.811 --> 02:01:59.945
THAT'S WHAT TO CORRECT HAVE

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:02.715
BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THAT.

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.483
AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.318
OVERSIGHT OF LOCATING MARC

02:02:06.385 --> 02:02:07.386
PROGRAM WITHIN P. JEANNIE TO

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:08.721
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE BEING

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:09.655
PUT IN PLACE WHICH DOES

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:12.958
INCLUDE. A OUTSIDE CONSULTANT

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:15.327
TO BOTH MARTYRED A LOGIN MARC

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:16.562
PROGRAM AND THE SAFETY CULTURE.

02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:18.264
THANK YOU MISTER PALMER. AND I

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.699
NOTICED THAT SENATOR STERN HAS

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:22.034
A QUESTION BUT I DID WANT TO

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:24.603
JUST FINISH THIS TRANSPORT- AND

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:29.875
THIS QUESTION DIRECTOR NG- YOU-

02:02:29.942 --> 02:02:32.645
SODA DOES. THE SO CAL GAS AND-

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:34.980
ESTY GENIE USE THE SAME METRIC

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:37.016
AS P. JEANNIE TO MEASURE D. AND

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:39.418
SAFETY- AND IS IT LIKE WHY IS

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:43.522
TIED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:45.424
AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION PER

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.626
SE I CAN'T SPEAK IN DETAIL

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:50.096
ABOUT HOW THE GENIE QUANTIFIES

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.864
ITS METRICS BUT WE DEFINITELY

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:55.167
TRACK. AND MONITOR ARE LOCATED

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.436
MARC METRICS BECAUSE THOSE ARE

02:02:57.503 --> 02:03:00.539
IMPORTANT SAFETY METRICS- THAT

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:03.609
WILL FOCUS ON THE SAFETY OF OUR

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:04.343
SYSTEM ESPECIALLY IN

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:07.913
COMMUNITIES- WE DO HAVE. THE

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:10.349
SAFETY METRICS THAT WE TRACK

02:03:10.416 --> 02:03:11.817
FOR OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:14.086
I CAN'T SIT HERE TODAY AND TELL

02:03:14.153 --> 02:03:16.589
YOU EXACTLY WHETHER THERE IS

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:18.290
ONE FOR THAT BUT- I WILL SAY

02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:20.526
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:21.761
DO FOCUS FONG. AND I AND I WILL

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.062
SAY I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:24.630
THAT WE FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE

02:03:24.697 --> 02:03:25.831
IT IS AN IMPORTANT REST OF

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:28.167
PIPELINE SAFETY. IF YOU ARE TO

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:32.304
HAVE. A DIG IN BY A THIRD PARTY

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:32.905
YOU KNOW AND I AGREE WITH THAT

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:35.407
HOWEVER IS P. JEANNIE FOUND

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:36.742
THAT THEIR METRIC AND THEY

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:38.711
THEIR USE OF. OF THAT

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:41.313
INCENTIVE- IN THE PERVERSE

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:43.949
NATURE OF THAT ALLOWED THEM TO.

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.785
JUST IT WAS A NUMBERS GAME

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:48.087
RATHER THAN A QUALITY GAME TO

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:49.855
DETERMINE WHETHER THE WORK WAS

02:03:49.922 --> 02:03:50.589
ACTUALLY DONE IN A TIMELY

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:52.725
MANNER. IN ORDER TO MEET IT SO

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:55.127
I GUESS MY CONCERN IS HOW HAVE

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:57.863
YOU TAKEN. THE NECESSARY STEPS

02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:58.998
TO MAKE SURE THAT ALONG THAT

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:00.499
PROCESS THAT THERE IS A

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:02.902
COMPLETE. MEASUREMENT AND

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:04.937
DYNAMIC WITH THE METRIC SO THAT

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:07.006
IT IS ACCURATELY REFLECTING A

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:10.142
SAFE AND A THOROUGH PROCESS-

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:14.113
BEFORE THE. INCENTIVE IS PAID

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.182
OR GIVEN. THAT'S A VERY GOOD

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:20.052
QUESTION I WILL SAY. THAT

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:21.554
DOCTOR SHERMAN MENTIONED THE

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.622
IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG SAFETY

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:25.457
CULTURE AND THE DYNAMICS OF

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:28.861
PEOPLE. AND AT SO CAL GAS WE

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:31.564
HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:32.131
EMPLOYEES THAT COME TO WORK

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.333
EVERY DAY. HONOR TO SAFEGUARD

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:37.002
THE SAFETY OF OUR SYSTEM AND

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:39.205
COMMITTED TO THAT AND I FIRMLY

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.373
BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.575
ACTUALLY LIES IN A STRONG

02:04:42.641 --> 02:04:45.477
SAFETY CULTURE WHERE WE FOCUS

02:04:45.544 --> 02:04:49.315
ON. ACTING OUR FELLOW EMPLOYEES

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.784
AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:53.652
PRIORITIZE THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:55.888
MAKE UP THE FOUNDATION ABOVE

02:04:55.955 --> 02:04:58.224
ALL ELSE AND THAT'S OUR CULTURE

02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:00.726
AT SOCALGAS. THANK YOU-

02:05:00.793 --> 02:05:07.833
SENATORS TURN. HEY MISTER CHAIR

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.635
Q. WE SHOULD NOT CREATE A LINE

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:11.403
OF QUESTIONING I WAS GOING TO

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:15.374
FOLLOW UP. SPECIFICALLY WITH

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:17.843
REGARD TO- THE STATE OF THE

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:22.648
SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.717
I TOOK A FEW NOTES DURING

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:29.388
MISSING YOUR TESTIMONY BUT- DID

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:30.589
I THINK YOU SAID THERE WAS THAT

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:31.790
THERE WERE A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:34.326
MILES LEFT OF PIPELINE AND THAT

02:05:34.393 --> 02:05:36.262
ARE DUE TO BE REPLACED I GET

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:40.399
THAT RIGHT. ACTUALLY WHAT I WAS

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:42.468
REFERRING TO WAS. WHEN WE

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:46.205
INITIALLY FILED OUR PLAN WE HAD

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:48.707
TO RAPIDLY RUBIO. DECADES OF

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:50.175
PAPER RECORDS AND WE INITIALLY

02:05:50.242 --> 02:05:52.611
HAD A HIGHER ESTIMATE OF THE

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:55.080
NUMBER OF PIPELINES IN CLASS

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:56.081
THREE AND FOUR LIKE LOCATIONS

02:05:56.148 --> 02:05:57.917
IN HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS THOSE

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.952
ARE THE CRITERIA SET FORTH. IN

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:02.187
THE NTSB SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.056
FOLLOWING SUMMER NOW. WE

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:05.958
INITIALLY HAD A HIGHER ESTIMATE

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:08.093
AND ONCE WE TOOK ADDITIONAL

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:10.229
TIME TO REVIEW OUR RECORDS. WE

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:14.133
HAD ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.234
FIFTY MILES REMAINING. AND HOW

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:18.671
MANY OF THOSE MILES HAVE YOU

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:20.606
BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR. INSTEAD

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:22.074
SINCE RECEIVING PERCENT

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:24.610
UPDATING YOUR YOUR REVIEW. IT'S

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.145
WELL OVER A HUNDRED MILES I

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:28.147
COULD GET YOU THE EXACT NUMBER

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.782
AFTER THE MEETING GIVE OR TAKE-

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:31.650
ABOUT FIFTY MILES AND THEY'D

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:33.886
PROBABLY LESS THAN THAT OF THE

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:37.489
REMAINING CLASS THREE OR FOUR-

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:39.825
CANDIDATES FOR UPGRADE. CORRECT

02:06:39.892 --> 02:06:42.227
OKAY AND BUT THAT DOES NOT

02:06:42.294 --> 02:06:43.395
INCLUDE I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:46.332
THAT LINE TO THIRTY FIVE TWO-

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:48.334
WHICH RUPTURED IN A MORE REMOTE

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.569
AREA AS WELL AS THE I THINK IT

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.171
WAS LINE FOUR THOUSAND THAT WAS

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:52.972
TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:55.207
SUBSEQUENTLY AND THEN LINE

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:55.874
THREE THOUSAND THAT DURING THAT

02:06:55.941 --> 02:06:57.109
REPAIR PROCESS WAS ALSO.

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:58.944
REDUCED CAPACITY ARE THOSE

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:01.480
KINDS OF LARGER TRUNK LINES NOT

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:06.885
WITHIN THAT. THAT CLASS. THREE

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:07.386
FOR ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:08.988
TALKING ABOUT. THE IMAGE ABOUT

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:11.223
MILEAGE BE OUTSIDE OF HIGH

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:14.793
CONSEQUENCE AREAS IN MORE RULE

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:19.398
REGIONS AT THE HELP WAIT

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:19.999
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PIPELINE

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:23.502
MAY HAVE FANS THAT ARE OUTSIDE

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:24.903
OF HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS AND

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.438
THEN HAVE AREAS THAT ARE WITHIN

02:07:26.505 --> 02:07:28.207
HIGH CONSEQUENCE AREAS BUT

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:30.642
YOU'RE CORRECT THAT. I POINT IN

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:32.711
LESS POPULATED AREAS WOULD NOT

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:34.847
BE INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. GOT

02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:36.749
IT AND DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE AN

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:38.684
ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT OF WHAT

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:41.620
THE RATE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN OF

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:45.391
THOSE. THOSE VARIOUS REPAIR

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.193
PROJECTS. SORT OF CLASS THREE

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.562
AND FOUR PLUS THE LARGER TRUNK

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:56.668
LINES IN THE RURAL AREAS- FOUR

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:58.270
SEVERAL SINCE YOU KNOW SINCE

02:07:58.337 --> 02:08:01.306
WHEN DID IT RUPTURE- TWENTY

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.641
SEVENTEEN I THINK IS ONE LINE

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:03.208
TO THIRTY FIVE RUPTURED YOU

02:08:03.275 --> 02:08:06.678
KNOW HOW MUCH. RATE PAYER-

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:10.149
IMPACT THOSE IS AHEAD. WE

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.418
PREPARE RATE IMPACT ANALYSES

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.620
WHEN WE SUBMIT APPLICATIONS FOR

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:15.921
REVIEW OF THE COSTS THAT WE

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:18.357
RECORD I CAN PULL UP THOSE

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:20.292
NUMBERS FROM THE PUBLIC FILINGS

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:23.529
AND PROVIDE ON YOUR OFFICE. BE

02:08:23.595 --> 02:08:24.963
GREAT- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.498
THOUGH JUST AS A ROUND NUMBERS

02:08:26.565 --> 02:08:28.700
ARE WE TALKING MILLIONS

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:31.070
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BILLIONS.

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:32.538
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:34.940
AMOUNT THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.642
HIGH POINT INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.210
SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS FOLLOWING

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:40.212
NUMBER NOW IT IS OVER A BILLION

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:43.215
DOLLARS. AND RIGHT IN ADDITION

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:44.983
TO THE ENHANCEMENTS THOUGH THE

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:48.954
REDUCE CAPACITY. IN THOSE LINES

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:49.588
DURING REPAIR AND THAT'S REALLY

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:50.889
BEEN AN AREA OF MY CONCERN IS

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:54.960
THE IS THE REPAIR PROCESS OF

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:55.527
TWO THIRTY FIVE TWO ONE FOUR

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:58.764
THOUSAND- TOOK SO LONG. AND

02:08:58.831 --> 02:09:00.032
WE'RE GOING INTO ANOTHER WINTER

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:01.066
SEASON HERE WE'RE WE'RE

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:02.234
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE THOSE

02:09:02.301 --> 02:09:03.869
STORIES ARE THE SAME COLD SNAPS

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:05.370
MY SENSE WAS IN ADDITION TO

02:09:05.437 --> 02:09:06.772
THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:08.640
INVESTMENTS THAT WERE. BASED ON

02:09:08.707 --> 02:09:09.641
APPROVED BY THE P. YOU SEE

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:13.112
THERE ARE ALSO- ACTUAL GAS

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:17.816
SUPPLY COSTS BREAKS ASSOCIATED

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:20.786
WITH IT IS THAT. IT DO YOU HAVE

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:23.422
A SENSE OF THOSE NUMBERS. I DO

02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:27.626
NOT WE DO HOWEVER NEED TO TAKE

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.495
FINDS OUT OF SERVICE TO

02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:31.163
MAINTAIN THEM AND THAT IS PART

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:32.464
OF OPERATING IN NATURAL GAS

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:35.134
SYSTEM. I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.936
ASKING IS THE ESTIMATED VALUE

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:41.073
OF REDUCED CAPACITY WILL REDUCE

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.708
THE PRESSURE ON A PIPELINE TO

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.109
CREATE A LARGER MARGIN OF

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:45.477
SAFETY OR WHEN WE REMOVE THEM

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:47.513
HI PLANE TO DO NECESSARY

02:09:47.579 --> 02:09:49.348
ASSESSMENT WORK I DON'T HAVE AN

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:51.750
ESTIMATE OF THAT. INCREMENTAL

02:09:51.817 --> 02:09:53.752
COSTS. GOT IT AND I KNOW BUT I

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:56.054
KNOW THAT THE C. P. U. C. WAS

02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:59.057
WAS TRACKING. THAT ADDITIONAL

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.627
COST ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:04.029
LENGTH OF TIME THAT THAT TO

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:06.965
THIRTY FIVE REPAIR TOOK- MISTER

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.834
PALMER DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHERE

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:11.436
IS YOUR DIVISION. AWARE OF THAT

02:10:11.503 --> 02:10:14.072
SORT OF STUFF INCREMENTAL.

02:10:14.139 --> 02:10:17.843
ADDITIONAL COST. BUT

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:18.977
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE STATE

02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:20.913
IMPORTANT DIVISION NO WE DO NOT

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.247
TRACK THAT I DON'T BEGIN TO

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:23.615
DIVERSION BUT I AM HAPPY TO

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:25.484
FOLLOW UP WITH THEM AND FIND

02:10:25.551 --> 02:10:28.554
OUT FROM MARS YOU KNOW. WHAT'S

02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.456
COMING UP SO. CREATE THAT- TO

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:34.092
DO- ACTOR MISSING JUST VERY

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:37.062
HERE DO YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE

02:10:37.129 --> 02:10:39.932
ANY FURTHER MAJOR- OUTAGES IN

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:45.504
SERVICE OR- AND PREPARE EVENTS

02:10:45.571 --> 02:10:47.339
GOING INTO THIS WINTER SEASON.

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:49.174
WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:54.012
AVOID. OUTAGES DURING A PEAK.

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:57.783
TO PEAK NEED. I CARE IF I DID

02:10:57.849 --> 02:10:59.218
KNOW OF AN OUTAGE BY THE WAY I

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:00.719
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE IT

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.521
PUBLICLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:06.225
MARKET SENSITIVE BUT- WE DO DO

02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:08.894
WHAT WE CAN TO AVOID THAT

02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:11.730
DURING PEAK MONTHS. OKAY BUT SO

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:14.266
BUT- YOU CAN'T CONCLUSIVELY SAY

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:18.036
THAT THERE ARE NO MAJOR REPAIRS

02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:18.604
BEING PLANNED FOR THE COMING

02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.973
MONTHS. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:23.408
BUT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:26.311
IF AND I. THINK WE ALL KNEW TO

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:27.412
THIRTY FIVE WAS OUT AND WAS

02:11:27.479 --> 02:11:30.315
TAKING A LONG TIME AND- I'VE

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:31.883
GOT MY OWN OPINIONS ABOUT WHY

02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:34.886
IT TOOK SO LONG AND- A BACK AND

02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:36.521
FORTH IT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN YOU

02:11:36.588 --> 02:11:38.290
ALL OVER STREAMBED ALTERATION

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:40.259
PERMITS. I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:11:40.325 --> 02:11:42.928
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN AVOID IT-

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:45.163
THOSE DELAYS AND THE COST

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:46.565
IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:49.101
DELAYS IN THE FUTURE- SO I

02:11:49.167 --> 02:11:50.669
RECOGNIZE THAT'S NOT DIRECTLY A

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:52.170
SAFETY ISSUE IT'S MORE THAN

02:11:52.237 --> 02:11:53.805
RATE IMPACTS OF THIS SAFETY

02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:54.973
ISSUE BUT I WOULD JUST

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.775
APPRECIATE IF YOU GUYS HAD. ANY

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:58.744
DATA ABOUT THAT INCREMENTAL

02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:00.912
COST FACTOR AND MISTER PALMER

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:03.015
THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT- I

02:12:03.081 --> 02:12:04.349
KNOW COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH HAD

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:06.151
BEEN TRACKING THIS IS PART OF

02:12:06.218 --> 02:12:09.021
THE ELITE SO CANYON PROCEEDING-

02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:11.523
AND SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE PC IS

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:13.358
PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT- I

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:14.559
KNOW THAT YOU GUYS OF

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:17.062
AUTHORIZED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:19.464
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:19.965
EXPENDITURES TO PERFORM

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:23.001
UPGRADES- FOR PIPING AND

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:24.836
EQUIPMENT FOR LEAD MANAGEMENT.

02:12:24.903 --> 02:12:26.738
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

INADEQUACY OF METRICS- RAISES

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:18.003
CONCERNS WITH THE INCENTIVE

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:20.272

02:16:57.642 --> 02:16:59.077
IN A WAY TO BROADEN THOSE

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:02.147
INCENTIVES- UNJUSTLY WITHOUT-

02:17:02.213 --> 02:17:04.883
THE ABILITY TO REALLY VERIFY

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.184
THAT SAFETY IS NOT BEING

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:08.286
COMPROMISED IN SOME FORM SO-

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:09.854
HOPEFULLY THAT WE'RE WE'RE

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.256

SURE SO I GUESS IN LOOKING AT

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:21.566
THE METRICS AND WHAT WHAT IS

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:23.802
THE REVIEW PROCESS IN THE CPUC

ABSOLUTE NUMBER. SO WE GET A

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:42.721
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF AND PER

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.056
WAY TO NOT JUST TICKETS SUCH AS

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.382
THAT COULD BE USED TO DETERMINE

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.785
IF THERE MAY BE HOLES THAT- IN

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.687

DRINKING WATER SOURCES ARE

02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:11.409
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

TO ENSURING THE RAPTORS MAKE UP

02:20:18.009 --> 02:20:19.477
TO DATE. WE GO EACH YEAR I

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:22.614
BELIEVE IS NOW FIVE CYCLE INTO

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:23.882
EACH OF OUR AREAS OF

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:25.016
RESPONSIBILITY AND PART OF THAT

02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:27.018
IS A RECORD AUDIT- DURING THAT

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:29.187
RECORDS AUDIT WE ARE LOOKING A

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:31.723
INFRASTRUCTURE MAPPING-

RECORDS MAINTENANCE. AND THAT

02:20:42.834 --> 02:20:43.935
WE WOULD SEE WHAT IS THE LAST

02:20:44.002 --> 02:20:45.603
TIME THAT THEY HAVE TO DIGEST

COMMENTS WE SPENT SIGNIFICANT

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:01.005
EFFORT TO BUILD OUR SYSTEMS OF

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:02.307
RECORD FROM THE GROUND UP AFTER

02:23:02.373 --> 02:23:04.776

TO CONTINUALLY ASSESSING

02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:17.889
POPULATION GROWTH A LONGER

02:23:17.956 --> 02:23:21.592
PIPELINES MUCH- ALIGNED WITH

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:23.594
WHAT PG&amp;E DESCRIBED. WE AT

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.430
SOCALGAS HAVE TAKEN THE

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:27.165
POSITION OF INVESTING IN

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:28.833
ASSESSING OUR PIPELINES AND NON

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.836
H. C. A.'S UNDER INTEGRITY

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:34.505
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. ALL ALONG-

02:23:34.572 --> 02:23:36.240
WHEN I GAVE THAT INITIAL FIGURE

02:23:36.307 --> 02:23:38.142
FROM TWENTY TEN AND THAT SAID

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:40.078
WE WERE- WE HAD ALREADY

02:23:40.144 --> 02:23:41.813
RETROFITTED 50% OF OUR

02:23:41.879 --> 02:23:43.314
PIPELINES TO ACCOMMODATE IN

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:45.216
LINE INSPECTION THAT INCLUDED

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:48.853
NON HCA. SO WHAT WE FIRMLY

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.421
BELIEVE IS THAT THE SAFETY OF

02:23:50.488 --> 02:23:52.890
OUR PIPELINE IS CRITICAL AND

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:54.726
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:58.162
WHAT WE DO IS OFTEN- GO ABOVE

02:23:58.229 --> 02:23:59.731
AND BEYOND THE THEIR

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:02.867
REQUIREMENTS IN HCA'S AND ALSO-

02:24:02.934 --> 02:24:04.936
PERFORM ASSESSMENTS AND NON

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:08.172
HCA'S. MMHM WE'RE VERY GOOD

02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:12.410
THANK YOU IN THE CASE NOW CAN

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:13.644
LOOK INTO THE FUTURE A LITTLE

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:16.681
BIT- TO P. JEANNIE AND SOCALGAS

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:19.817
OF. ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS

02:24:19.884 --> 02:24:21.219
AROUND PIPELINE SAFETY ARE

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:23.154
OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY TO

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:25.323
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT REDUCTION

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.792
OR IN SOME CASES ELIMINATION OF

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:30.795
NATURAL GAS USAGE. WHAT IS YOUR

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:33.531
VISION FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:34.232
OF NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE

02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:35.733
HOW DO WE ENSURE SAFETY IS

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:37.668
PRIORITISED DURING DURING THIS

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.537
DECADE. AND WHAT ARE SOME OF

02:24:39.604 --> 02:24:41.539
THE RISKS THAT YOU FORESEE

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:49.447
ARISING FROM THAT. THIS CONCERT

02:24:49.514 --> 02:24:52.250

VERY FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE OF

02:24:57.655 --> 02:24:59.323
OUR GAS BUSINESS AND WHAT WE

02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:01.559
CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:02.794
CONTINUE TO OPERATE A SAFE

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:06.197
SYSTEM AS WE EAT SUPPORT THE

02:25:06.264 --> 02:25:06.964
STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:09.534
EMISSIONS GOALS SO THE COUPLE

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.669
PIECES OF OUR STRATEGY OR

02:25:11.736 --> 02:25:13.304
MAKING SURE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING

02:25:13.371 --> 02:25:15.807
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND-

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.675
PRUDENT INVESTMENTS IN OUR GAS

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.210
SYSTEM TO ENSURE SAFETY AND

02:25:19.277 --> 02:25:22.647
RELIABILITY. WHILE ALSO

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:26.684
ENSURING THAT WE ARE. USING THE

02:25:26.751 --> 02:25:28.453
GAS SYSTEM AS IT EXISTS TODAY

02:25:28.519 --> 02:25:30.955
TO HELP SUPPORT- REDUCING

02:25:31.022 --> 02:25:32.090
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:25:32.156 --> 02:25:34.125
THROUGH WEEK ABATEMENT FOR

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:36.727
CAPTURING METHANE- AND

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:37.995
LEVERAGING THAT IS RENEWABLE

02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:39.397
NATURAL GAS AND ULTIMATELY

02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:42.066
RESEARCH INTO HYDROGEN- AND TO

02:25:42.133 --> 02:25:44.102
DETERMINE THE WAYS THAT THE

02:25:44.168 --> 02:25:45.403
SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO BE

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:47.572
USEFUL INTO THE FUTURE- AS WE

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:49.040
LOOK AT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED

02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:51.309
WITH THIS TRANSITION- YOU KNOW

02:25:51.375 --> 02:25:54.145
I THINK. RELIABILITY IS-

02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:57.048
SIGNIFICANT AREA FOR US TO

02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:57.615
FOCUS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:25:57.682 --> 02:25:59.016
THAT. YOUR FIRST RANKING THE

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:00.151
FOOTPRINT OF THE GAS SYSTEM

02:26:00.218 --> 02:26:01.686
THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A

02:26:01.752 --> 02:26:03.654
RELIABLE SYSTEM THAT CAN SERVE

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:05.890
THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE NOT

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:06.657
CONTINUE TO BE SERVED BY IT AS

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:08.793
WELL AS- OBVIOUSLY CONTINUING

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:10.428
TO MAKE THE CURRENT SAFETY

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:11.829
INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. YOU

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:12.964
KNOW I THINK THE OTHER RISK

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:14.866
THAT WE ARE EXPLORING TO TRAIN

02:26:14.932 --> 02:26:16.000
MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND IT

02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:17.468
BEFORE WE MAKE ANY TRANSITION

02:26:17.535 --> 02:26:19.137
WITH THE GAS SYSTEM IS.

02:26:19.203 --> 02:26:25.610
UNDERSTANDING. SHINTO HYDROGEN-

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:26.310
AND SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:27.311
AMOUNT OF RESEARCH GOING ON IN

02:26:27.378 --> 02:26:28.846
THAT AREA TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

02:26:28.913 --> 02:26:30.248
CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM

02:26:30.314 --> 02:26:32.850
SAFELY AS WE MAKE- ANY

02:26:32.917 --> 02:26:35.520
TRANSITIONS THAT THE STATE. IS

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:37.421
CONSIDERING MOVING FORWARD SO

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.456
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS I

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:39.891
WOULD HAVE LIKED. THANK YOU

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:44.162
MISSING. THANK YOU I TOOK A GAS

02:26:44.228 --> 02:26:45.930
WE SEE OURSELVES IN TEN YEARS

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:47.832
BEING THE CLEANEST SAFEST AND

02:26:47.899 --> 02:26:50.067
MOST INNOVATIVE GAS

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:51.068
DISTRIBUTION UTILITY IN THE

02:26:51.135 --> 02:26:54.405
COUNTRY AND TO DO THAT WE ARE

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:57.475
ALSO INVESTING IN A LOT OF I'VE

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.243
HEARD IN THE AREAS OF RENEWABLE

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:02.780
GAS. HYDROGEN AND OTHER

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:05.049
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES I SEE

02:27:05.116 --> 02:27:09.120
THE GREATEST RISK IS PERHAPS A-

02:27:09.187 --> 02:27:12.056
SHORT SIGHTED- PERSPECTIVE

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:14.592
THAT. WOULD SAY THAT THAT YOU

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:18.863
SHOULD HASTEN THE PATH TO

02:27:18.930 --> 02:27:21.199
GETTING THERE THAT COULD CREATE

02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:22.600
HONOR ABILITIES AND SYSTEM

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.101
RELIABILITY THAT THAT WE HAVE

02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:26.904
EXPERIENCED LATELY I WOULD SEE

02:27:26.971 --> 02:27:30.341
THAT AS THE GREATEST RISK. OKAY

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:32.143
IN THANK YOU MISSING AT THE

02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:33.244
APPRECIATE THE THAT COULD PICK

02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:36.113
COMINTERN SENTIMENT- IF- OF

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:37.682
DISTRACTED ASKED THE SAME

02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:39.584
QUESTION TO THOSE OF MAY STILL

02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:41.652
BE ON THE ON THE CALL STILL

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.454
FROM OUR FIRST PANEL IF YOU'RE

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:47.592
STILL THERE- AND I DON'T MEAN

02:27:47.658 --> 02:27:48.893
LOOK DOWN HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.628
ANYONE IS STILL ON THERE BEFORE

02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:52.096
ANYONE ELSE HAS CIVIL COMMENTER

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:55.266
OF RISING. OF THOSE RISKS IN

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:57.735
THE FUTURE YEARS- OR HOW WE

02:27:57.802 --> 02:28:00.037
ENSURE SAFETY IS PRIORITISED

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:02.506
DURING THIS NEXT DECADE- IF NOT

02:28:02.573 --> 02:28:06.811
THE- DIRECTOR PALMER THE CPUC
