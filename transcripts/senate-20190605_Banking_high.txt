CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR BRADFORD PRESENT AND FOR HERE CHIANG. THANK HERE CABALLERO. SO HERE RAZA. RATHER HEAR MYSELF [inaudible] PORTANTINO. A QUORUM IS PRESENT. WE HAVE FOUR ITEMS TO PICK UP TO DA WE HAVE. ONE ITEM ON CONSENT SO WE CAN GET EMOTIONALLY LET'S DISPENSE WITH THE CONSENT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR DRAWS SO. IT'S TO PASS -- STILL. I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON A. B.. NINE THIRTEEN MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CONSENT CALENDAR BRADFORD. HI. I CHANGE TIME. I HAVE A I DON'T. HAVE A ERROR I DURAZO. PRESENT I BY SO. BROWN [inaudible] PORTANTINO. THAT MOTION ON CALL RON NEXT UP IS SOONER -- MEANS SENT A SEMINAL DONALD. AB -- THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SIMONE IF YOU'RE READY WILL. TAKE THAT MEASURE. ARE YOU READY MISTER CHAIR WE'RE READY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WILL ADD A DEFINITION OF CONSUMER CREDIT TRANSACTION TO CURRENT LAW TO CLARIFY AND SUPPORT THE LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATION. THAT THE COVERED LOAN LAW DOES NOT INCLUDE BUSINESS PURPOSE LOANS. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE LEGISLATOR CREATED CALIFORNIA'S COVERED LOAN LAW. RESPONSE TO CURRENTS CONCERNS OVER PREDATORY BRIDGES BUSINESS PRACTICES INVOLVING CONSUMER LE CONSUMER LOANS. THIS LOSS SAID OUT SEVERAL RESTRICTIONS TO READ HIGH INTEREST RATES AND FEES ON CONSUMER LOANS. TODAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF MORTGAGE BROKERS SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO ARRANGE LOANS UNDER THE COVERED LOAN LINE. LOAN LAW AS THE RESTRICTIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE A PROFITABLE ALONE. IN A RECENT AUDIT OF A MORTGAGE BROKER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE ARMAND DETERMINED THAT ALONE TAKEN OUT FOR A BUSINESS PURPOSE COULD STILL BE CONSIDERED A CONSUMER LOAN. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA. COVERED LOAN LAW. CONSUMER LOMA. THE DR A REACH THIS DECISION BECAUSE THE DEAD DEFINITION OF CONSUMER LOAN. UNDER THE COVERED LOAN LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT THE LOAN BE INTENDED FOR ANY SPECIFIC PURPOSE. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EVERY OTHER PART OF THE FINANCIAL CODE. WHERE THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER LOAN SPECIFIES THEY ARE PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES? IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE FINANCIAL CODE. AND TO ENSURE BUSINESS PURPOSE LOANS CONTINUE BEING OFFERED BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR CLARIFIES THE CONSUMER LOANS CREATED UNDER THE COVERED LOAN LAW. ONLY INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARE PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS TO TESTIFY TODAY IS A MIKE BELOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WE REALLY VIEW THIS AS A CONFORMITY ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE FINANCIAL CODE THE CIVIL CODE. FEDERAL LAW IN RAGS HE AND THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT THEY ALWAYS DEFINE. CONSUMER CREDIT TRANSACTION IN THE SAME WAY THAT I A LOAN INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES. WE ALL OF EXECUTED SUCH LOANS IN THE MORTGAGE WORLD AND CAR LEASES AND ALWAYS ASKS IS THIS FOR A BUSINESS PURPOSE. OR IS THIS FOR A PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES. THIS WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING FOR TWENTY YEARS AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE DEPARTMENT A REAL ESTATE HAS NEVER INTERPRETED THE LAW. THIS WAY UNTIL RECENTLY AND SO WE BELIEVE THIS IS A CLARIFICATION MANY OF THESE LOANS INVOLVED. A LOAN AGAINST A PERSON'S HOUSE TO FIX AND PICK UP. FIX AND FLIP ANOTHER HOUSE BILL SOME OF THESE LOANS DO CREATE HOUSING AND MODERNIZE HOUSING WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT AREA OF COMMERCE BUT IT DOESN'T. WE THANK HISTORICALLY BELONG IN THE COVERED LOAN LAW. SO WE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITH THIS IN OPPOSITION. TING HEARING ON BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE SENATOR CAFIERO. THAT LAST EXAMPLE JUST TO HAVE A BROADER QUESTION AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS IT IS IT. IS IT -- IS WITH THE CHANGE MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE BORROWING ON A HOME. IF TO FLIP A HOME BECOMES A BUSINESS. TRANSACTION BORROWING ON YOUR HOUSE TO BUY A AND FLIP ANOTHER THAT WOULD BE A BUSINESS PURPOSE LOAN YES YOU ARE NOW A REAL ESTATE INVESTOR. AS A AS OPPOSED TO BY BUYING IT FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSE RIGHT TO BE EXACTLY RIGHT. MY QUESTION IS WHAT HAS LED TO THIS MISINTERPRETATIONS OF SPEAK THAT IT'S YOU SAY IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE AND NOW WHY. THEY'VE BEEN AUDITING AND MISTER CHAIR -- REAL ESTATE BROKERS IN INVOLVED IN THIS SORT OF COMMERCE FOR EVER. AND THE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED WE MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE THE OTHER DAY THEY SAID WELL. WE KNOW THAT IT'S TO FIND IN THE FINANCIAL CO THE CIVIL CODE FEDERAL LAW IT'S NOT DEFINED IN THE COVERED LOAN LAW. SO WITHOUT THAT THE CLARIFICATION WE E CHOOSE TO APPLY ANOTHER DEFINITION. WE ASK HIM TO RECONSIDER AND WE SAID WE WOULD BE RESOLVING IT LEGISLATIVELY AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD WORK WITH US ON THAT. THE CITY WHAT WOULD WORK WITH US I'M NOT HERE TO REPRESENT THAT THEY HAVE A POSITION -- HAVE SAID EITHER WAY. NEED TO SOME QUESTIONS BY. COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- HOURS SEEKING A EMOTIONALLY -- HOUSE TO RULES. BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CHIANG MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR OF MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO RULES. SENATOR BRADFORD HI BRADFORD AYE KING. I AM I ERA. I DURAZO. DRESSER I WAS SO [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] PORTANTINO [inaudible] PORTANTINO HI. MEASURE HAS SIGNIFICANT ONCE YOU GET OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. MISTER O'DONNELL. NEXT UP IS THE ROOM AND QUIRK SILVA. YOU HAVE ITEM ON AB. OR TWELVE ALONG WITH ESCROW AGENTS SO WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB FOUR ONE TWO ON LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO HELP CALIFORNIANS. INDEPENDENT ESCROWLICENSES CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR NECESSARY AND VALUABLE S. PRO SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS QUITE A FEW OF THESE IN OUR AREA. AB FOR TWELVE WOULD EXEMPT INDEPENDENT ESCROW LICENSES FROM A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES AS ADOPTED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. I CHANGE WHICH WOULD INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL RESERVES BY ALMOST THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE CURRENT AMOUNT REQUIRED BY LAW. THIS WOULD RESULT IN FIRMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSES AND PROVIDE ESCROW SERVICES. NOTABLY SMALL BUSINESSES IN INDEPENDENT FIRMS WHO WE KNOW BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE. DISPROPORTIONATE REGULATORY BURDEN WOULD BE VERY MUCH IMPACTED I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. THREE WITNESSES WE HAVE WRONG KINGSTON. FROM THE ESCROW INSTITUTE WE HAVE PJ GARCIA SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT THE ICY AND MICHAEL HAAS FROM CPA -- TO HEAR SOME COMMENTS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EQUITY RON KINKS IN REPRESENTING THE ESCROW INSTITUTED CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. FOR DURING THIS BILL TODAY AB. FORTY TWELVE RETAINS THE DECK. EXCUSE ME THE DECADES LONG LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. KEEP IT AS IS THE REASON FOR THIS. IS THAT THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING. I STANDARDS BOARD FASB IF YOU WELL. ARE AN INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY. OVER FINANCIAL. FOR NON GOVERNMENTAL. AGENCY RECENTLY UPDATED ITS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. JUST TO MODIFY HOW. THESE ENTITIES REFLECT LEASES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET. THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD. IGNORES ALL THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THERE ARE. AND IF WE FAIL TO ACT TODAY. AND THE BILL FAILS TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW. THE IMPACT WILL BE DEVASTATING ON S. INDEPENDENT ESCROW COMPANIES IT WILL REQUIRE ALL OF THESE COMPANIES [inaudible] TWO AS OF DECEMBER FIFTEENTH THIS YEAR. TO PUT IN A SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNTS. ALL THE RELEASE OBLIGATIONS FOR THEIR CURRENT YEAR. AND NEVER TOUCH IT FOR ANY REASON. THEY CAN'T USE IT TO PAY SALARIES THAT CAN'T USE IT. TO EVEN MEET THEIR LEASE OBLIGATIONS THEY CAN'T USE THAT TO PAY FOR OFFICE SPACE LEASES NOTHING. YOU LEAVE IT ALONE AND THAT BANK ACCOUNT. ALL THAT MUCH MONEY REALLY QUITE FRANKLY IS NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THIS CREATES AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND WHAT WE SEE IS THIS IS NO SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR EACH OF THE SMALL INDEPENDENT. BOB OWNED ESCROW COMPANIES IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR ESCROW COMPANY LOCATION. WHICH THEY CAN NEVER EVER TOUCH WITHOUT. AB FOR TWELVE SMALL BUSINESS FORMATION [inaudible] EXPANSION. ANY IMPROVEMENT WON'T HAPPEN. AFTER ALL IT IS OUR FEELING THAT IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. WE WANT TO KEEP THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR LEASES JUST THE SAME AS IT HAS BEEN FOR DECADES. WITH ME TODAY -- IS PJ GARCIA A LONG STANDING MEMBER. OF THE ASSOCIATION AND A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND WELL AS MICHAEL HAWS A CPA WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT [inaudible] OF KNOWLEDGE. THAT HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS KNOWING THIS INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PJ GARCIA AND I'M THE OWNER OF BEACH PACIFIC GAS GROWING HUNTINGTON BEACH CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF VESTER INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA'S THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT. AB TWELVE SIX TO RETURN TO RETAIN THE EXISTING LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD AS IT IS TODAY. BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ARE TAKE AFFECT. IMPORTANCE OF RICK CURRENT LIQUIDITY COM COMPUTATION BY REMOVING THE AMOUNT OF THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. FROM THE DEFINITION OF CURRENT LIABILITIES CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. IF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS HAD BEEN IN PLACE WHEN I OPENED MY BUSINESS TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO IT'S LIKELY THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE THE OUR CAPITAL. CAPITAL INVESTMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HIGH. AND THEN I WOULD BE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER TODAY. CURRENTLY OF THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE LICENSE DOES FOR COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES? EMPLOYEE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AT LEAST HISTORICALLY MOST AS FOR COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE WITH MY STORY. YOU CAME THROUGH THERANKS AND LEARN THEIR PROFESSION ON THE JOB. SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AS FOR JOBS HAVE BEEN IN ECONOMIC UP OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND AS A PROFESSION WHERE YOU GET ON THE JOB TRAINING. LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I STARTED. MY CAREER AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN AS A RECEPTIONIST WITH NO TRAINING NO AND NO. BACKGROUND OR TRAINING IN ESCROW. TEN YEARS LATER I OPEN MY OWN COMPANY. AT WHICH TODAY LIKE MANY OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES AND UP ON BY MY COLLEAGUES IS NOW MULTI GENERATIONAL. WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. YET TO YOU TO VOTE YES ON A BEFORE TWELVE TO PRESERVE THE CURRENT. LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT HAS WORKED WELL FOR DECADES. CONSUMERS REGULATORS CPA'S AND LICENSEES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE HERE TODAY. JUST AS A BRIEF CONTEXT. OF THE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE ESCO COMPANIES WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THEM OR WE DO THE CERTIFIED AUDITS. AND OUR FIRM HAS BEEN DOING THEM SINCE THE FIFTIES SO WE ARE VERY -- INTIMATELY KNOWLEDGEABLE WHAT'S GOING ON AS FOR FAST BEEN IN THIS WHOLE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD -- THAT'S CAME CAME ABOUT IN THE CONVERSATION I'VE HAD WITH MEMBERS OF THE OF THE BOARD. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AS A SWEEPING IMPLEMENTED. THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE THE THE INVOLVEMENT WITH BARS TO LENDERS AND COVENANTS WITH LOAN COVENANTS AND AND WHY THEY PUT TOGETHER THIS LONG IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. AND I RAISE THE QUESTION WITH THEM WHAT ABOUT REGULATORY COVENANTS. AND THE RESPONSE WAS THEY FELT THAT THE REGULARS WOULD TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION TO WORK WITH THE SPECIFIC LICENSEES AND THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT'S A CONCERN TODAY. WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO WOULD IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATIVE TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO HOW HOW THE COMPANIES WILL DO THEIR BALANCE SHEETS? OR HOW ORGAN AUDIT THE BALANCE SHEET AND SO ON IT'S JUST REMOVED THIS NEW -- AMOUNT THE SHOWING UP IN THE CURRENT LIABILITIES FOR LEASE OBLIGATIONS. FROM THE COMPUTATION OF THE LIQUID ASSETS REQUIREMENT UNDER FINANCIAL CODE SECTION. SEVENTEEN TO TEN AND SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DOING ANYTHING INJURIOUS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IT'S JUST AS AS MISTER SCEA MISTER KINGSTON. HAVE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE TO THESE LICENSEES. IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THEM NOT TO BE. SO TO SPEAK INJURED BY HAVING TO HAVE A HIGHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT. THAT HASN'T COME ABOUT BY A PASSAGE OF OF DIFFERENT LEGISLATION SO ON IT WAS JUST A TRYING KEEP. THEIR LIQUOR REQUIREMENT STATUS QUO OF WHAT IT HAS BEEN. AND AND AND TO JUST FROM OF THIS. ONE ELEMENT THAT'S COMING IN THE CURRENT LIABILITIES FROM THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC WITH US REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU AND YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SHOW YOU CAN TAKE THE MIKE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON L'ISOLA CHOIR I OWN CITRUS ESCROW LOCATED IN MARINO VALLEY IN BEAUMONT -- I EMPLOY TEN WOMEN I'M A DISABLED VETERAN SMALL BUSINESS WOMAN OWNED -- ESCROW COMPANY AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BECAUSE OUT OF MY POCKET I'D HAVE TO COME UP WITH ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MY COMPANY WHEN THIS GOES INTO EFFECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS JEAN ENGELSTAD FAMILY ESCROW SERVICES IN SAN DIEGO I HAVE THREE OFFICES IN SAN DIEGO AND I'M PLAY THIRTY FIVE WOMEN. AND I IT JUST TWO OF MY LEASES WOULD COST ME OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO THIS. SO IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE PASS THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. XENA QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. SENATOR COPY OUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ON YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY. EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS -- BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A TRUST ACCOUNT CORRECT. SO -- SO IT'S NOT. I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH AN AN M. THIS ORGANIZATION. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. IT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN THIS EXACT SAME ORGANIZATION REQUIRED CITIES TO PUT ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET [inaudible] THERE -- THERE ARE PROPERTY ASSETS THAT ARE NOT REAL PROPERTY AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAD TO EVALUATE WHEN EVERY CHAIR AND TABLE AND DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING. THE BALANCE SHEET. BY THE CREATED A LOT MORE WORK FOR EVERYBODY -- AND I'M I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE IF IF. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. THE FAULTS OF THESE ESCROW COMPANIES OR THAT THEY'VE. SOMEHOW HURT SOMEBODY. IT'S THAT ON ITS THAT SOMEONE HAS DECIDED YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET -- IN. THEIR RESTRICTING WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH WITH ASSETS THAT YOU HAVE THAT ARE ACTUALLY LIQUID. THAT ARE THAT ARE COMING IN PERIODICALLY I MEAN I'M STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY. EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS AND PLEASE HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT MY QUESTION IS. IT'S AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD THAT REALLY. THAT THEY WEREN'T TARGETING INDEPENDENCE FOR COMPANIES. WHAT IT DOES IS CHANGES THE THE CALCULATION OF WHAT GETS COUNTED AS THE? AS A LIABILITY WHEN YOU CALCULATE THE LIQUID ASSETS. SO USUALLY THE ASSET HAS THE LEAST HAS VALUE. I'M BEING AN ACCOUNTANT NOW BUT AT LEAST HAS VALUE SO WHAT WHEN YOU DO THE THE OTHER CALCULATIONS OF YOUR NET WORTH. YOU GET BOTH YOU GET THE ASSET AND THE THE LIABILITY AND AND BUT IN THIS NEW STANDARD MEANS WE COULD ONLY GET THE LIABILITY. NOT THE ASSET SO INCREASES IN THE END THIS IS. YOU CAN'T COUNT IT IS AN ASSET WHICH WE CAN'T COUNT IT AS A ASSET WE HAVE IT'S NOT TO DO WITH -- WITH DEFAULT CERTIFICATIONS BECAUSE THOSE ARE COVERED BY BONDS THIS IS -- A LIQUID ASSET REQUIREMENT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. OR IN THE CAN SWELL MICHAEL CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THAT MORE THAN I CAN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND LONGER EVEN THAN ME. BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T ADD ANY VALUE I DON'T SEE ANY CONSUMER PROTECTION TO IT HAVING MORE MONEY BUT I CAN'T USE. DOESN'T PROTECT ANYBODY. SENATE CAREER JUST AS THE EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY THE COMPANY HAS AN OPERATING CAM WAS A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IT. AND RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT LIABILITIES. THREE TWELVE THIRTY ONE TWENTY WHICH IS THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF THE NEW. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ROLE. OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LIABILITY THAT'S OUR NORMAL ACCOUNTS PAYABLE COMMISSIONS A ON PLOYS AND SO ON OTHER NET LIQUID. IS A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENCE AND HAVE TO BE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LET'S SAY THEY HAVE AN OFFICE LEASE ON THE PAY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR OFFICE LEESON IS A THREE YEAR LEASE. SO UNDER ACCOUNTING RULES YOU HAVE TO TAKE TWELVE MONTHS OF LEASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TO BE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NOW COMES INTO A CURRENT LIABILITY POSITION ON THE BALLOT SHEET. THAT HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE. NOW INSTEAD OF BEING. SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE GOOD THERE NOW 900-0 DOLLARS TO THE BAD. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN JUST BECAUSE US PEOPLE BACK IN. AND FOR CONNECTICUT WANTED. TO CHANGE ACCOUNTING SANDERS WITH THE BALLOT SHE HAS TO LOOK LIKE. AND THEN IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT. CONSUMER PROTECTION ROSE BY STATE THAT -- MAY MAKE THIS -- RELEVANT TO ANOTHER STATE AS OPPOSED TO CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES. WELL I THINK SO A MAN OF ON ALL. ON THE FOR TO TO MISTER KING SAID ON THIS TO A LITTLE BIT AS WELL. IS THE INDEPENDENT S. WHEN HISTORY IS IS UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES HAVE THEIR SETTLEMENT SERVICES. INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS AND THEY HAVE CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THEIR OWN STATES THE VERY WELL COULD BE ANSWER LEAVE LIKE THE TITLE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATIONAL. ENDEAVOR AS WELL SO THE SO YES I THINK SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEED TO SEND US SENATOR DORADO. WHY WAS IT SET UP THIS WAY? THE NEW INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. OKAY THAT'S WHAT'S CHANGED RIGHT THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS CHANGED IT WASN'T LIKE THIS. ONE BUT WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR IT IS GONNA BE A RATIONALE FOR IT NOT JUST LIKE SOMEBODY WAKES UP ONE AS WHAT WHAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED AND IT WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN IT STARTED TO THIS IS WHEN THE HOUSE BE WAS GETTING PRESSURE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING. STANDARDS BOARD TO CONVERGE THE UNITED STATES UNITED GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WOULD CONVERGE AND BE YOU. CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL. AND AND THE THE WITHOUT PICKING ON CERTAIN ANY CERTAIN GERMAN THE GERMAN FROM THE BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. IS THE ONE WHO'S REALLY PUSHING THAT HE WANTED LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON THE BALLOT YOU BECAUSE ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THEY ALWAYS HAD LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. IN UNITED STATES GAP. GENERALY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES LEASE OBLIGATIONS OF ALWAYS BEEN DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES. AND THAT'S NOT HAD AND THAT SO THAT WAS NEVER IS SORT OF LIKE LEASES WERE NEVER KNOWN. THEY JUST WERE NOT ON THE BALANCE SHEET. AND SO FAST WE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS THIS POSITION AND THEN. A COUPLE YEARS AFTER THAT STAR THE ABANDONED THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE BUT THEY'RE STILL LIKE THE IDEA. RELATIVE TO THE LENDING COMMUNITY AND BEING TRANSFERRED MORE TRANSPARENT. THE LENDING COMMUNITY ALL OBLIGATIONS THAT A COMPANY WOULD HAVE ON ITS BALANCE SHEET. AND SO THEY SIDE THEY'RE STILL WANTED TO HAVE. LEASE OBLIGATIONS BOOKED ON TO THE BALANCE SHEET NOT JUST AS A FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURE. AND ON THE BALANCE SHEET YOU HAVE KERN OBLIGATE CURRENT AT LIABILITIES AND NON CURRENT LIABILITY SO ANYTHING DO WITH AND AND THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET WOULD CHOSE OF HIS CURRENT. LAW THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING LENDER COVENANTS ON LOAN COVENANTS ON PEOPLE'S LINES OF CREDIT AND SO ON AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY ALSO TOOK ALMOST LIKE A SIX YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. SO THAT PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES ARE EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND NON PUBLIC AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TO GET PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REDO THEIR LOAN COVENANTS AND WORK IT OUT WITH LENDERS AS TO WHAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE. AND SO THE FAST BE FELT THAT. I'M AN OVERALL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS STANDPOINT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS NOW ON THE BALANCE SHEET. AS LIABILITIES NOT JUST IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE UNTIL THAT'S WHERE CAME FROM AND LIKE LIKE MISS GARCIA TALKED ABOUT. AN IN AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IS THAT BECAUSE THE THESE INDEPENDENCE WILL COMPANIES HAVE THIS LIQUID ASSET REQUIREMENT UNDER FINANCIAL CODE. SEVENTEEN TO TEN OF OF NET LIQUID MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES HAS TO BE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. WELL BY THIS INTERNATIONAL BY THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD COMING IN. BY INCREASING CURRENT LIABILITIES. IS NOW MAKING A TOUGHER TO MEET. OUR BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE SOARED INCREASE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHICH IS THE CASH. YOUR STILL GONNA BE ABOVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT'S NOT AFFECTING THE NET WORTH OF THE COMPANY NECESSARILY PER SE. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPACTING THE QUALITY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IS NOT ALLOWING THEM JUST A BUMP UP. NET LIQUID TO MAKE THE THING THE QUESTIONS TO WORK THE SAME PLOTS WERE. FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POINT. BETTER. CENTER WILL WILL PUT IT IN GUIDE. INTO LAYMAN'S TERMS SALAS GUYS PLEASE I'M. THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDER CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS. AND THE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS ARE UNLIKE OTHER. EVERY OTHER STATE WE HAVE PERFORMED A A DO AND AND CONDUCTED DUE DILIGENCE LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER STATES THAT WE COULD DISCOVER. IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. FINDING THAT THEY ALL STATES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS CALIFORNIA. TO IT DOESN'T AFFECT AUDIT REQUIREMENTS IT IS DISCOVERABLE IT IS NOTED THERE IS NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER THE AUDITS IN CALIFORNIA OR MANDATORY. UNLIKE OTHER STATES. THE AUDIT SORE ANNUAL AND THE LAST POINT IS THAT THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE FOR AS YOU CAN SEE -- WORD THE P. A.'S TO FIND US DISCOVER IT. AND NOTED. SO WHAT WERE ASKING IS TO RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON INDEPENDENT ESCROW COMPANIES. TO SET THIS MONEY ASIDE IN THIS IS I WAS CHARACTERIZING IT LOCK BOX WHICH YOU CAN'T EVER USED FOR ANYPURPOSE. SERVING AS AN IMPEDIMENT. AS WE WERE SAYING TO THE BUSINESS FORMATION AS MS GARCIA WAS SAYING. BUSINESS CREATION AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOR REALLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT'S THE HOPEFULLY. THE SHORT ANSWER IN LAYMAN'S TERMS. AND I CAN MAKE IT EVEN SHORTER THAN THAT. IS THAT AS WAS NOTED MANY OF THESE ESCROW. ARE WOMEN THAT START WITH. SOMETIMES JUST THEMSELVES MAYBE ANOTHER PARTNER MAYBE THREE AND WHEN YOU ASK FOR A WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE THESE ASSETS OF AT THE LEAST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO MAYBE A HUNDRED THOUSAND AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF A BUSINESS THAT COULD VERY WELL MEET MAKE. THE DIFFERENCE OF THEM HAVING A BUSINESS EVEN START. AND I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY AM I QUESTIONS ROSE A LINERS SINNERS ROSIN COPPER EUROS WELL AS WHAT PROMPTED THIS ANALYZE CALIFORNIA UNIQUE. TO THE REST IN THE NATION THAT WE NEED TO BRING FORTH THIS MEASURE RIGHT THANK YOU.
