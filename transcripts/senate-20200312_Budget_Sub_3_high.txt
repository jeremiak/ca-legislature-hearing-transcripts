GOOD MORNING I'M AN EIGHTEEN FOR CHARIZARD IN GENERAL FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. SENATE FAILS FINANCE GOOD MORNING NINA HENNINGER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TIGER WOODS FINANCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WELCOME. THESE BEGIN THANK YOU- A. AS AS A AS YOU KNOW- ADVERSE AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TOXIC STRESS PRESENT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HIT IN PLANES SIGHT. WE FROM THE C. HAD AND THERE DOCUMENTED STRIKING FINDINGS ONE. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE INCREDIBLY COMMON 62% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE AT LEAST ONE SEVENTEEN POINT 6% OF CALIFORNIA. BY CITY LEADERS IT HOW FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE. AND OUR SECOND STRIKING FINDING IS THAT THERE IS A DO RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THE LEADING- CAUSES OF DISEASE- AS WELL AS MENTAL ILL HEALTH AND NEGATIVE SOCIAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING HEART DISEASE STROKE. LONG IS. THE PART SUICIDALITY SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE AND HOME. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO COORDINATED EVIDENCE BASED PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO ADDRESS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TOXIC STRESS AS A MAJOR DRIVER OF CHRONIC DISEASE AS YOU KNOW WITH. THE GOVERNOR CREATED THE ROLE OF THE- CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL- AS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE- SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE THE DRIVERS SOME OF OUR MOST SERIOUS AND CHALLENGING- PUBLIC HEALTH CHILD AS- THE PAST YEAR MY OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING TO. TO PULL IT TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY. FIRST IN THE NATION EFFORT TO TRAIN OUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ON HOW TO SCREEN FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES HOW DO EIGHT FIVE EIGHT SO SEATED POSITION. HOW TO RESPOND WITH TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND WHILE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE RECOGNIZED BONTA EIGHT IS WE KNOW THAT THE NAME AND- HEALTH CARE IS DOES NOT OFF A TRUE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE INCLUDE PREVENT. AND FRENCH BUYERS OKAY ASIAN CROSS TRAIN. BE TO A FIVE IF. THE WHO ARE IN IRAQ. WITH THE RE SAYS AND TOOLS BE ABLE TO PREVENT RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TOXIC STREP AND THAT IS THE WORK OUT WE- IN THE CURRENT ASK WITH. IN DOLLAR. IT OVER TO YOU ON PUBLIC AT ACROSS. RIGHTS TO THE PROPOSED LOVE AND MILLION ENCOMPASSES EIGHT MILLION FOR THAT PUBLIC A TOOK AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. TO RAISE AWARENESS ENDING ABOUT ACES AND TOXIC STREP ND THEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS PER ACRE TRAINING EFFORT WHICH WILL CONSIST OF. IN FOR ONE PERSON FOR CATEGORY THIS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ONE SPENT AND THEN GENERALLY GOVERNMENT WORKERS. IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I CAN COVER THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SO THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT HOW WOULD WE IMPLEMENT PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND WITH THE PLEASE BE AND- IT IS EXPECT. WE WOULD UTILIZE- OUTSIDE OF SERVICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENT AND DELIVER THE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN- THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR OF A VARIETY OF ENTITIES TO INVOLVE. NOT PROFIT PROFIT. TENCHI BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SO- BUT WE DO INTEND ON USING- INTO IT HAVE EXPERTISE I IN THAT IT AND THEN WILL BE MANAGED BY THE PACIFIC IN GENERAL SO. A MAN. TAKES A TRACK OF THOSE TYPE. MANAGE BY THE OFFICE. ANYTHING OKAY AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION WITH THE EFFORT BILL UPON EXISTING MEDIA CAMPAIGN RESOURCES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. I WE HAVE BEEN IN. NATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT UTILIZING THE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM PUBLIC IN THIS CAMPAIGN SUCH AS BACK- IN. THOSE ANTI CAMP IN AND WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK TO OTHER TYPES OF WHAT AWARENESS ANZOR. BY THIS TO JUST COVER CAL IS. PEOPLE AWARE CAMPAIGN SO THE IDEA IS TO USE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS TO INFORM OUR CAMPAIGN. AND THE ONE WITH RESPECT TO WHO WERE TO CROSS SECTOR TRAINING MATERIALS AND HOW THOSE TRAININGS BE CONDUCTED. I WE ALREADY HAVE HAD A VARIETY OF THE DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS A DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I REACH OUT TO IT ALREADY- WITH INTEREST IN A TEAM. I THE MATERIAL PAN BOTTOM ASSIST WHAT DOES DEPARTMENTSWOULD BE BUT THEN ALSO- IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERY OF THOSE TRAININGS THE IDEA IS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE TRIP IT IS ALREADY OCCURRING WITHIN THOSE ENTITIES AND REALLY TAKE A TRAIN THE TRAINER. WHICH WITH THE- FACT. GETTING MATERIAL AROUND ACES AND TOXIC STRESS. HELLO SONYA PETTITTE KALLIO WE HAVE A HOPEFULLY MINOR ISSUE RELATED TO QUESTION ONE- OR OTHER QUESTION TWO IN THE AGENDA AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH C. ADMINISTRATION IN THAT. THE VISUAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXEMPTS- THE OFFICE CONTRACTS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE- SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED IN THE SENSE THAT SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE HOPING TO LEVERAGE- NOT SORT OF THE TRADITIONAL TYPE OF- CONSULTING CONTRACTS THAT MIGHT BE PUT OUT FOR BID BUT SOME OF THE CALL. MAY BE. OR BRAVE LIKE CAMPAIGN SO GIVE. BILL SO FAR ON THESE CONTRACTS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE WHICH IS TO ENSURE PROPER USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS WE SUGGEST A SLIGHT REVISIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE TO SORT OF DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF CONTRACTS EXIST REQUIRE THEM TO FOLLOW THE TRACK CODE FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL ONES. OKAY WHICH IS NOT I WAS GONNA SAY I WOULD JUST A THAT WE- THAT SENTIMENT AND WE ARE WORKING ON A REVISED LANGUAGE. FINANCE TED AT THE THAT OKAY NOW QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TURTLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OUT JUST WONDERING IN TERMS OF THE CAMPAIGN DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA THAT YOU'LL BE USING TO JUST KIND OF HELP IF. WHAT THE **** TO IMPLEMENT THIS PAIN. I AM A WIN YOU MEAN I MEAN- BASELINE AND FOLLOW UP DATA AROUND- THE EFFICACY OF THE CAMPAIGN. ENTER NEED. IN IN YOU KNOW ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE PETITIONS JUST ALL IS IT JUST- A CROSS FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE WILL WE BE TARGETING- SO WE KNOW- CITY AND PARTNER WITH A YOU SEE. THE ANALYSIS I AT COUNTY LEVEL AND I BELIEVE NOW CITY THE AROUND THE PREVALENCE OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE WE GOING TO USE I'M- THE- AROUND. WANTS TO TARGET WHERE WE'RE WE TALK ACT YES ABSOLUTELY. Q. THAT FEW QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THE LA IS COMMENT ABOUT- THE- CONTRACT CODE YOU KNOW WE- DEFINITELY WANT TO TRY TO PAID CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GOING AROUND. THE REGULAR COMES TO BACK CONTRACTING AND OF. SO IN TERMS OF THE- WELL FIRST OF ALL THE A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN- SAYS EIGHT MILLION I CAN. BUT CAN YOU TO. ARE YOU TO PARTNER WITH OTHER ENTITIES LIKE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS OR OTHER AND TRY TO EXPAND THE I MEAN EIGHT MILLION FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S NOT A LOW DOWN IT'S A WHOLE LOT WELL I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE RIGHT WE GOT BY THE WAY THE SENSE THAT FORMS. SPEAK TO HOW HOW IS THE EIGHT MILLION GOING TO REACH. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU EXPECT REALLY REACH WITH YOUR EIGHT MILLION AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO THE ARE YOU LOOKING TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THAT. WHAT WILL WE THIRD CERTAINLY. LOOKING TO LEVERAGE CAPACITY WHETHER IT'S- IN EXISTING- PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN FOR. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY. ENTITIES THAT HAVE PASSED CITY TO DISTRIBUTE. A YOU KNOW THE MASS. AROUND ASUS. SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD DO THAT TO THE LARGEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE MAY NOT BE. PAINS IN. FRANCE ONE THING IT BE IN OUR IS YOU KNOW THE RESOURCE. CAPACITY SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE REESE ARE THE WOULD HAVE TO BE A NEW EFFORT BUT AGAIN WOULD BE. ALL THE OF A- TIED UP AT IN TWO MORE OF DELIVER OUR CAMPAIGN. AND PART OF THAT PLAN THAT STILL NEEDS TO DONE AROUND THE PUBLIC AWARENESS IS REALLY- WHAT DOCTOR BURKE AMEND. IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT TYPES OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW MOST SUITABLE TO ADD IN THE PAIN. RELEASED TO LEARN A HOW WE- EIGHT EIGHT WHAT IT CAMPAIGN MORE. I WOULD JUST I'M- THAT. THE WHY WE DO INCLUDE LANGUAGE ABOUT ABOUT THE THAT CON IT'S BEST BE WE DO HAVE PHILANTHROPIC IN OTHER WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PARTNERING ON. AND SO WHAT WE INTO TO. OUR GOAL TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER ADVANCE X. THE REACH HEY END OF WHO IS THAT TARGET AUDIENCE FOR YOUR PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IT'S IS PUBLIC BUT IS IT. FOR THERE IS IT SAM. WHO IT GIVEN THE LIMITED. I MEAN IT IS IT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET RID AWARENESS MONTH YEAH TYPICALLY SO. WE'VE BEEN A I SAID TO THE X. THAT WE DIRECT OUR- SOME OF THE EIGHT. EIGHT AT OF THE PUBLIC AT CAMPAIGN TO MEDICAID RISK. TO AND THE TO TALK TO THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND BOB PULLED OFF OF THE- AT THE EXISTING EFFORT THAT WE TURN TO AN OUT PROVIDERS THAT BAD. AT ON THE DOLLARS TO WE DEPLOY THE AND THEN BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT A DON'T JUST MEDIC COME. SO WHAT WE AND TO. IS A BALANCE. BETWEEN BETWEEN A DIRECTED AT THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- YOUNG PEOPLE. I THE WORD THE SIXTY TWO OKAY WHO'VE X. IN THE ONE A AND THE P. WHO LOVE THEM SO A 100% OF CAL. SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND EIGHT EIGHT ONE THINGS THAT THE HELP. THE END JUST RECOGNIZING WHAT RESOURCES YOU'RE ASKED FOR YOU'RE USING ABOUT LIKE OKAY BY AT THE BY THE SOCIAL AND WHAT PRINT OUT DID JUST BY ITS NOT GONNA SEE IT. YES BUT FIT SO. I THINK OF THE HELP TO YOU KNOW WHEN ONE. THING COME BACK. NUMBER SPACE. ABOUT THE- IT'S STAR GO YEAH I ALL OF US USE UP HERE TO RUN TO WE HAVE A FEELING YOU OKAY YOU KNOW WHO WE A SIX RESOURCE TO COME ACTUALLY TALK TO THAT GOING TO. TERMS OF THE CROSS SECTOR THAT COMMON FORM TRAINING NOW IS THIS. SO WHAT DEGREE WE- TEST OF LAMBS AND WAIT WE RAISED OR NOW RAISING AWARENESS OF EXES. AND WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE FEEL USE THE STATISTICS AND THEN I MEAN YOUR FUTURE SHOULD OF PETER'S LIKE WHAT WE DO NOW RIGHT SO ARE WE ARE WE TEACHING PEOPLE MEDI XIN ARE WHAT THAT SO THE SECTOR BEING TRANSFERRED. IT'S ONLY TO ME **** WITH THAT AND WHAT IS THAT WE CAN BE TO TIE TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT THINGS THEY CAN DO TO MITIGATE. ALSO BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVE A ASUS SCORES. WHAT WHAT HAVE HARRY DRESSING THAT YES SO MUCH OF THE ORIGIN FOR THAT CROSS SECTOR TRAINING INITIATIVE IS ACTUALLY- NOT ONLY FROM WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL BUT FROM OUR IT DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. OUR HELP SHAPE AT THREE. ON THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE- CDC ARE- AT IT'S REACHED OUT- GTD P. HAS REACHED OUT- THE SUPER IN A PUBLIC EDUCATION HAS SAID HEY YOU KNOW WE WILL BE OUR- AT. BEING AT COMMUNITIES WHERE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO I JUST SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS BUT WE WOULD. AND FOR THAT WE'RE USING THE OTHER BASED. AS WE ARE TO PUT. IN THE THAT WE'RE DOING TO THE BUDGET THAT'S- AT THAT WE ASKED FOR IS REALLY THE RESOURCE THAT TO ALLOW THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL TO A MAP THE TEAM AND THE RESOURCES BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND PROVIDE THAT EXPERTISE- AND MATERIALS TO FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO INCORPORATE IN THEIR EXISTING TRAINING. OKAY SO. WE HAVE A SENSE GIVEN THE IN HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO. CONNECT HOW MANY DEPARTMENTS THIS INCORPORATES FOR THIS FOR THESE RESOURCES BAIL WE CAN WE CAN DEVELOP A MORE- PRECISE- ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY DEPARTMENTS THAT WE'RE- PLANNING TO REACH WITH THIS AT. ALL PATIENTS OKAY THAT DEL HELPFUL SO I DON'T TO HAVE MORE SPECIFICITY GIVEN IF YOU GIVE US TWO MILLION THIS IS WHAT. DO IT RIGHT. BUDGET PROCESS SELF. TO A- MULTIPLE. I COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT- WORKERS AND- SPECIALS AND- SO THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED- SO I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE ALSO YOU'RE HAVING STATIONS WITH I MEAN THAT HE SAID TOWN AND FEW WORK. CHILD SUPPORT CAL SO WE WERE. THIRD LINES ACTUALLY THE ONES WHO ARE GATEWAY TO THE RESOURCES THAT MAY OF THAT STATE PROVIDES. INCLUDING YOU KNOW. AB CALL FOR ACTION ARE THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE INVOLVED AND- HELPING- ADDRESS SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE MITIGATION ISSUES SO I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S SOME BUT ABOUT HOW HE- WITH. THOSE I'M SURE YOU TALK RATE TO THE PHARMACY THE SERVICE AND THE SERVE SO FOR BUT HOW YOU REACH AN WHERE THE FRONTLINE WORKER ARE AND IT BECAUSE I CENTER THANK THEIR INTEREST. AND SO THAT THAT MAY ALSO BOB RESOURCES WELLS SO THAT MIGHT HELPFUL KNOWS WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE TWO MILLION AND WEBER DEATH RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY WELL THANK VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENT THANK YOU FOR DEATH GETTING MORE INFORMATION FOR ME REVISED THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT UP WE HAVE- WEALTHY PROPOSED. CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION. WELCOME. SINCE LIKE. PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES LOOKS LIKE LA ON FINANCES THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WE CAN OF THE AGENCY FOLKS INTRODUCED THEMSELVES. WELCOME GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S ELAINE SPARTACUS I'M THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WITH THE OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JENNIFER SCHWARTZ ON THE CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY. YOU HI I'M- SO- I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR QUESTIONS- AND THEN OF COURSE ANSWER ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THE WHAT YOU TO WANT TO GO AHEAD PRESENTED THEN GO THROUGH A QUESTION AND THEN WILL HELP. THEM WHAT. SO THE- PROPOSES. BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION. WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- THE PROPOSAL LANGUAGE WOULD MERGE THE CURRENT OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY THE OFFICE OF THE PAY. ADVOCATE AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS. A AND INTO THE NEW CENTER- IT WILL COMBINE THE FONG. THESE ENTITIES. ARE DOING WHAT INCLUDE ANY REPORTING ON QUALITY CARE. AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE A PUBLIC HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAMS. WILL CONTINUE GUIDANCE ON. DATA SHARING. AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH INFORMATION. THE LOS CLOTHES HAMPER. AND REVIEW RESEARCH PROPOSALS THE- DATA ASKS. THIS THE CENTER ISLE OF MAN A RESEARCH DATA HOW BEEN BEEN DATA PORTAL. ENGAGE AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EXPAND HEALTH DATA SHARING HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY CLIENTS GUY AMONG STATE ENTITIES IMPROVE DATA PROCESS AND NOT MANAGEMENT. PARCHMENTS AND FINALLY DEVELOP ENERGY FUTURE DATED SHOULD HAVE THEN THE AGENCY UNLESS PROPOSAL IS A COST NEUTRAL PROPOSAL. I'VE OUR ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WHY DOES THE PROPOSAL WOMEN AT THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCATE COMPLAINT DATA REPORT AND HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION- AND TEND TO TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF CALL CENTERS OF THE FOUR REPORTING TO PART OF THOSE REPORTS PERMITTED APARTMENTS HEALTH CARE SERVICES COVER CALIFORNIA REVENGE. WHAT DO I. THE GOAL OF POOR WHICH IS TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE THIS COMPLAINT CALL DATA- AND THE RELATED CONSUMER ASSISTANCE INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS- TO IMPROVE. IMMERSES ARTICLES WITHIN THESE FOUR ENTITIES- THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE STILL ALLOWS THE CENTERS TO COLLECT THE STATE SO THAT'S NOT STOPPING- WHAT WITH TO SEE THOSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO EVALUATE THE- PLAYING. FORTY AN ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION- BUT WE DO IT DOES POSE A FEW QUESTIONS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE- IN THE MOST CURRENT REPORT IT STATES IN ONE PART THAT THE DATA PRESENTED MAY PROVIDE IN PERFECT COMPARISONS- BETWEEN YEARS AND REPORTING ENTITIES COVERAGE TYPES AND SOMEWHAT CATEGORY SO WE THINK THAT'S WITH A PAUSE AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE. WHAT WE CAN DO IT BETTER. I'M NOT I WOULD LIKE TO POP. BETTER WOULD LIKE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK ALSO THE REPORT BASED ON SOME STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND FIND OUT WHAT'S FEASIBLE FOR THE WHAT'S MORE USABLE WHAT'S OF MORE VALUE ARE WE PUTTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION OUT TERE SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT AS WELL- AND THAT'LL BENEFIT OBVIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENTS AND ULTIMATELY THE CONSUMER SHOULD THE PATIENT THINK. ONLY ON THE DATA THAT WE WERE GOING TO CAN TO. ANALYSIS FROM THAT WOULD LIKE TO EMPLOY THE AGENCY'S OFFICE OF INNOVATION TO HELP GO THE NEXT STEP. AND HELP THESE ENTITIES. CMOS WERE NEEDED TO DO BETTER AND REDUCE THE COMPLAINTS. SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT AND NOW WE WILL THEN THEN WILL COMMENT SO. THE REGARDING THE THIRD QUESTION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY. HOW HELLO HI THE MANDATE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH HIP BUT PROTECTION OF PATIENT INFORMATION WILL BE CONTINUED THERE IS NO DISTINCTION OR DIFFERENCE IN THE AUTHORITY IN CALLOW HIGHEST TUBES AND THIS NEW LANGUAGE INSTEAD SOME. TION OF THAT LINK. BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU CAN'T DO YOU SORT OF HAVE A COMPLIANCE WITHOUT ALSO CONSIDERING OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE HELP PRIVACY LAWS AND SORT OF BRIDGING THE GAP PERFORMS THE MORE COVERAGE OF WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE. WE'VE ALL BE DONE NOT AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE IN PATIENT POLICY MANUAL FOR STATE DEPARTMENT AND WHAT LANGUAGE DOES TO SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S REALLY HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET. THE AUTHORITY. THE IN COMPLAINTS ARE TO BE IN LARGE PART WILL NOT CHANGE SO COME LET ME KIND OF BREAK DOWN WHAT THAT MEANS A LITTLE BIT MORE- SO THE CENTER WILL STILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO DO YOU OVERSIGHT OVER STATE DEPARTMENT'S COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE HEALTH INFORMATION IT WAS THE LAWS THROUGHOUT TIRES SO THAT PEACE SAME WILL STILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH MEDI POLICIES WILL CONTINUE TO DO TO. VIEWS AFTER THE BREACH UP THEM THAT HAVE THAT WOULD A REVIEW- BUT WE'RE MERGING THE TASKS THIRD OPPOSE BAND REQUIRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE SO THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HERE THAT WE'VE HAD A LONG TIME TO COMPLETE I REALLY DOES MORE ABOUT FULL COMPLY OTHER THAN IMPLEMENTATION. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE THE FLEXIBILITY OF MOVING THOSE PROGRAMS IN CONSISTENT FORM WITH TYPE OF LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE THE STATE AND HIS HOUSE SO. YOUR PHONE ON. THE MANAGEMENT SORT OF STANDARD XIN OF THAT PIECE OF LOOKING AT TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE IN COMPLIANCE- FOCUSING ON WHAT VALUE WE CAN OUT THERE PROVIDING EDUCATION SO. THINGS IS MORE FRIENDS OF A RECOGNITION OF THE LEVEL OF COMPLAINTS AND MOVEMENT TOWARDS UP TRANSITION OF THAT. SO WITH RESPECT TO NUMBER FOUR- DESCRIBED WHAT BARRIERS OF SHARING OF THAT TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS IDENTIFIED THAT THE CENTER WOULD HELP MITIGATE SO- THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF STUDIES BY MEN THAT AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THE FEDERAL SIDE NOT STUDY WAS ON CALIFORNIA THAT- REALLY ABOUT WHY ARE PEOPLE DOING INFORMATION BLOCKING IS THAT WHAT THE BARRIERS TODAY TO SHARE. AND TO PIECES FROM LOS DOWN FIVE AT ONE THERE'S CAN UP LAWS WHEN THEY UP WITH THE MEAN AND TO THERE IS A RISK CATION HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE'S A FEAR OF POTENTIAL LIGHT. WE DID A LOT OF THE ENGAGE. AT HELLO HI WHEN WE PUBLISH SOMETHING CALLED THE STATE HEALTH INFORMATION MANUAL FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND COUNTIES. AND SO E HEARD A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT CLARIFICATION OF HOW CALIFORNIA LAW AND HOW FEDERAL LAW WORK TOGETHER. AND WHEN THEY APPLIED AND LOOKS LIKE TO ALSO BRING THOSE SORT OF STATE TO RECITE ENTITIES SO WE CAN STANDARDIZE LOOKS LIKE INTO. FIRST WE A TEST IN DOING HARPER CONCURRENT IN CARE. LET ME KIND OF GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN BY THE- ONE. THAT DOES PRESENTATION OF MORE OF PART. CHALLENGE WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW NO HEALTHCARE COVER. COVERED BY THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION OCT FOR CALIFORNIA. IF THEY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS THEY'VE. ACT IF THEY HAVE SOME DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES HISTORY THEN THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE COVERED BY THE LACK TO MEND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES ACT. IF THEY HAVE- SOME SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER HISTORY THAT THEY'RE ALSO VERY LIKELY GOING TO BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL FORTY TWO CFR TWO PM THE STATE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO THAT GIVES YOU A SUGGESTION OF LIKE HOW COMPLICATED THIS MIGHT BE. THE PERPETRATORS. PLANS AND A LOT INDUSTRY SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE ASKED HEY COULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION OF HOW THESE AND TO RELATE HOW CAN I DO THIS WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAW. IN THE PRO AND A YOU KNOW VALUABLE WAY FOR THE PATIENT. SO WE SEE THAT OUR VALUE TO BRING ON THIS WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHERE. OUR CONFUSION AND- NEEDING CLARIFICATION ON WHEN YOU CAN SHARE APPROPRIATELY UNLAWFULLY AND THE TO HELP PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION. TO CONTINUE PUBLISHING AND EXPANDING OUR GUIDANCE ON THAT FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. AS WELL AS GO OUT AND PERFORM MORE ENGAGEMENT AND MORE EDUCATION WITH COUNTIES WITH LOCAL ENTITIES. AND WITH A PRIVATE SECTOR. AND NONPROFITS. OKAY THANK YOU HELLO COMMENTS. HELLO SONYA PETTITTE KALLIO- I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR OFFICE- TOOK A LOOK AT YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS ACROSS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD EITHER REORGANIZED DEPARTMENTS ARE CONSOLIDATE PERMANENCE AND- THAT ANALYSIS- PROPOSED THAT THE QUESTIONS. THAT YOU WANT TO ASK WHEN THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE PREPOSTEROUS YEAH THE PATIENTS BENEFIT IT'S DOES THIS AND A POLICY GOAL. REFLECT JUST LATER. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS AND WINNERS BUDGET- THIS ONE. THE IN A FIT THANK PROBABLY OUTWEIGH THE I MEAN FOR OF ALL IT'S JUST IN DOLLAR IT'S COST NEUTRAL- THERE IS THE POTENTIAL ISSUE WITH THE REPORTING ON COMPLETE DATA BUT OTHERWISE I'M SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS- WE ALSO THINK- REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF BETTER COLLABORATE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS- AND OFFICES WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN. AGENCIES AGENCY. AND HOPING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW SOME OF THOSE- PROGRAMS NEED YOU KNOW WORK TOGETHER AND GETTING A BETTER SO. ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE DATA ACROSS THOSE DEPARTMENTS. THANK YOU FINANCE THING TO AT THE END OKAY ALL RIGHT- I'VE READ SO- APPRECIATE THE LOOKING AT THIS IN YOUR OPINION ACTUALLY QUESTION ANOTHER QUESTION SO GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S THOSE READING THIS IS A MERGER THE STREET THAT'S APARTMENT. I THE TITLE. CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION. YOU WANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT. ANY OF THE TASKS OF THE THREE AGENCIES THAT ARE BEING COMBINED TO FORM THIS IN FACT THE MAIN THRUST OF EACH OF THE AGENCIES IS NOT INSIDE INNOVATION I MEAN WITH LIKE INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION- BUT IT REALLY ISN'T OUT. PRIVACY AND PROTECTION AND ASSURING THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S NO PATIENT PROTECTION I MEAN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS YET THAT AND I DON'T AYE ENTITLES DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR WORK AND AGENCIES IN THE TITLE OF YOUR AGENCIES ACCESS THAT. THE FIGHT HELP CERTAINLY ONE ELEMENT TO HELP TO FIND THE CULTURE AND SEE. SO I MEAN I SEE CERTAIN BODY BEING A CENTER FOR DATE INSIGHTS INNOVATION IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CRUNCH THESE AND FIND OUT CERTAIN PATTERNS AND SO FORTH. BUT I WOULD THINK THIS. ENTER KEY GIVEN THE AGENCIES THAT WE COMBINE TO FORM THIS SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY AND SECURITY NOT INNOVATION AND INSIGHTS I MEAN NOT SEEN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BUT BUT THAT THAT SHOULD BE THERE IN THAT SHOULD. RIGHT THAT SHOULD BE THEIR MAIN THE PEOPLE GO TO WORK THERE'S- A STICKY PEOPLE PROTECTOR DATA RIGHT BE SURE THAT THEIR PRIVACY IS PROTECTED BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT ALL THE MULTIPLE LAWS RAIDS YOU MENTIONED RIGHT. THAT FOR OUR JOB IS TO BE FOR PATIENTS WHAT THEY HAVE COMPLIANCE- LEVERED AT- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PATTERNS O BE SURE THAT THE AND THAT THAT WERE DRESSING THE ISSUES THAT PATIENTS ARE RAPING WITH. PLAN ARE TYPES OF THINGS RIGHT. STATION THAT. FOR WELL IT OLD OFFICE HELD IN. INTEGRITY RIGHT. SO AGAIN I SORT OF FEEL LIKE WE'VE LOST THE PURPOSES OF THE THREE AGENCIES THAT WE PUT TOGETHER EVEN IN THE TITLE SO CAN YOU. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT ONE ABSOLUTELY. SO BE THERE'S SORT OF A SHORT TERM. NEED FOR EVOLUTION AND- SOME BUILDING AND THEN A LONG TERM VISION FOR WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND THE TITLE REALLY REFLECTS MORE OF A LONG TERM VISION OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO. BEFORE YOU CAN REALLY START DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED AS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WITH THAT TITLE. RELEASE START WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN'S AND SORT OF STANDARDIZED THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THEN ONCE WE SET. RULES AROUND WHAT COLLECTION LOOKS LIKE DATA DICTIONARY- ALL THOSE PIECES. ONCE WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S DATA WHAT IT MEANS WILL HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF. TAKING USE CASES AND COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES INSTEAD OF APPLES TO ORANGES. AND THEY'D BE ABLE TO LOOK THROUGH THAT. AND DO THAT KIND OF ANALYTICAL WORK. SO THERE. WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH RESPECT TO YOU. HOW WE CAN BETTER USE OUR DATA AND BETTER INFORMED THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE USING THEIR DATA ON HOW TO MAKE THEIR PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND IMPROVE SERVICES. SO ONE OF THE VISION THAT WE HAVE ISSUE. TO MOVE THIS TOWARDS. PULLING THAT INFORMATION FROM AN AGENCY PERSPECTIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE. DEPARTMENTS ARE AWARE OF WHO AT WHO'S AT HIGHER RISK WITHIN THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT. BUT AS AN AGENCY WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHO'S AT HIGHER RISK WITHIN. AS IN. E. PERSPECTIVE OVER THE SCOPE OF ALL OF OUR PROGRAM. AND SO. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE IT BASED ON SOME USE CASES. WHO IS AT RISK THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC RISK RESPONSE. SO THAT WE CAN REPORT BACK TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES LOOK TO SEE WHICH POPULATIONS ARE UNDERSERVED WHICH RESOURCES NEED TO BE ADDED TO CERTAIN. PROGRAMS TO HELP SERVE THOSE FOLKS ADD TO BETTER YOU KNOW PROVIDE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT. AND ALSO AS JENNIFER MENTIONED HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DATED THAT'S DATA RICH WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA ACROSS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS. AND ONE OF THE VISION THAT IN THE FUTURE AN ANALYST IN ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS CAN TAP INTO OUR DATA AND SOME TYPE OF THE PORTAL OR SEARCH DATA. AND MAKE IT INTO ASSISTANCE IT THAT'S ONE TERM. WELL WE TAKE OUR HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF THE POLICY ISSUES OF THE WORK. WE DO. DOING WELL BUT EXT AND- SO IT'S A LOT TERM VISION WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE NEED. THE NEW NAME A NEW BRANDING OKAY SO. BUT I'M GONNA BECAUSE THIS COST. OKAY SO OF THE GUY. RIGHT NINETEEN NINETY HEALTH SERVICES. FOR FACT CD. I ALSO EVEN IN LEGISLATURE I AUTHOR BUILD OPEN DATA RIGHT SO I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF DATA I ALSO- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- LEAST CERTAINLY. NEED AND CAN USE FOR BASED ON YOUR EXPLANATION I AGREE THAT WE COULD USE AND A CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION DATE THAT I POINTED OUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT IN QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA. WE SHOULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE WE ARE ANALYTICAL CAPACITY TO ANALYZE THE DATA WITHIN THE STATE IS PROBABLY IT DOWN GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF DATA WE HAVE IS. IT YOU KNOW COULD BE EXPANDED I THINK THERE'S ALSO- AND WHAT IS THAT AGAIN PROTECT PRIVACY FOR THEM SURE ALSO THEIR SECTORS. OKAY ALSO THE- BENEFIT. MARKS IN A WAY THAT IS SO THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THE STATE BUT OTHERS CAN CAN CAN- IT CAN YOU APPLY IT TO HELP BENEFIT YOU KNOW- THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND INDIVIDUALS AND SO FORTH. MY QUESTION IS THAT THE AGENCIES THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE HALF TO THEY HAVE SOME- INSIGHTS IN THIS BUT THEY THESE FUNCTIONS. HE IS ALMOST THE COUNTER BALANCE OKAY SO YES WE HAVE ONE AGENCY THAT'S FIGURE HOW HE PUSHED IT OUT BUT I ALSO WANT AN AGENCY THAT'S AS- YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE- BUT TIMES LIKE A BIG DATA WE CAN LOOK AT ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE CAN USE. BUT WE NEED TO ASSIST. YOU HAVE GREAT YOU WANT TO DO THIS BUT FIRST STEP IS THAT. IN ORDER TO RETAIN THE PUBLIC TRUST. INCOMPETENCE WE ALSO NEED PEOPLE WHOSE PRIMARY JOB IS SAY YOU KNOW WHAT BUT WE CAN'T DO IN A WAY THAT. THAT BASICALLY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE TO PRIVACY IS BEEN EXPOSED ANOTHER THING SO YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS MULTIPLE THE RATE AND THEIR INTERFACING ETCETERA AND YES THEY NEED HELP AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER DELIVER CARE TO LIMóN PART IS TRYING TO PUT ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER BUT WE NEED SOMEONE SAYS. BUT IT'S- GREAT WE'RE DO THIS AND EVEN LIKE HERE'S HOW THE LAWS SAY BUT THE REASON WE SAY HERE'S WHILE THE LHASA IT. THEY'LL LET YOU DO THIS OR WHAT X. Y. OR Z. IS ALSO THERE PART OF THEIR JOB TO SAY. YOU REALLY OUGHT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT WHETHER YOU REALLY WANT EVEN DO SOMETHING BECAUSE- THAT IF IT. THAT MAY LEAD TO A DATA BREACH ARE WRITTEN REVELATION OF CERTAIN THINGS RIGHT SO EVEN. IN WHAT WE CALL. THE INDEMNIFY DATA. IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH ELEMENTS YOU CAN GO BACK AND RECONSTRUCT. STRAIGHT AND SO IN THE A THROUGH Z. AS IN TO TRY TO YOU KNOW AND IT AND IT AND TRY TO PUT THE DATA TOGETHER TO DO THE INSIGHTS TO HELP PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THOUGH OLD MAY ALSO NOT BE IS SENSITIVE TO. BE WELL IT IS TO DO SOMETHING GOOD BUT ALSO PUT CERTAIN THINGS AT RISK IN TERMS OF PRIVACY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. AND AS- ABOUT PUTTING EVERYBODY IN THE SAME HOUSE. EIGHT BECAUSE IT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOUR MAIN MISSION OF THIS AGENCY IS TO DO INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION. AND YOU PUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO SAY WE WORRY ABOUT THE STUFF. UNDER NEED THEM AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY CAN TELL IS THE PERSON THE PERSON SAYS I NOR YOUR VICE BECAUSE I'M MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ACTS. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE YOU KNOW THAT THE EIGHTY EIGHT IFS ARE PROTECTED OR SEPARATE ROLE THAN WE COULD PROBLEMS CAN AND THEN OF COURSE ONCE. ONCE UP LIKE THAT HAPPENS AND YOU LOSE THE PUBLIC TRUST. DELETED THIS GO AWAY RIGHT WE'RE GONNA BE HERE TALKING ABOUT LOSS TO TELL YOU THE NO NO NO STOP STOP STOP EIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS BECAUSE READ STORIES ABOUT- YOU KNOW. THESE TECH COMPANY THEY WANT TO GET ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS OF HOSPITAL A MASK THESE LARGE. RECORD IS THE WORK MISSING BUT TO MOUNT RECORDS IS THAT ARE IN AS. WELL AND YOU KNOW THERE. SO THERE'S TYSON HAD THE- MONEY TO BE THERE TO. AND SO. YES THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THE AGE WITH THE I DO WONDER WHETHER THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SEPARATION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION AND OFF OF THAT THEY CAN PLAY THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE IN ADVISING ON THE NEED TO ADVISE DANY IN BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW THAT. THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO. I IS DIRECTOR OF THIS AGENCY IS GONNA SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT MY JOB IS INNOVATION AND INSIGHTS. AND SO YOU GUYS ARE CAN YOU STOP INTERFERING YOU KNOW TELLING US DON'T DO STUFF. EIGHTY GET WITH ANY DENTIST I ITEM NO THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION. I JUST ALSO WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THESE THAT WE CREATE THAT WAS AROUND WE TREAT. THE PATIENT ADVOCATE RATE IN THE IT WAS CENTER. ME THAT RIGHT AND HAD TO DEAL WITH THE SOME OF THE S. AND IN SOME OF THESE PRIZE ISSUE AND I WILL BE SURE THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE DONE. WAY AT. THANKS FOR IT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA THEIR JOB IS NOT TO IN A THAT THEIR JOB IS TO BE SURE YOUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO BE SURE TO GIVE GOOD ADVICE TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY BECAUSE ONCE WE STORY AGAIN. I'VE CI INTENT BECAUSE WE SOME BIG THEY'RE SAYING. WHICH OBVIOUSLY WAS THE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AND RATING. AND ASSUME THAT. BUT YET BECAUSE THE PROBLEM. THEN WE HAVE A THEN WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM OUR HANDS RATE AND SO I WOULD BE CAUTIOUS WE STRUCTURE OUR- THE BUREAUCRACY BAR ORGANIZATIONS IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE. THERE SO THAT TO THE RIGHT DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE PEOPLE WHO FINALLY MAKE POLICY DECISIONS. SO TO KIND OF SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL HELP. PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE- RETURNS- OF SOME OF THE FIRST. SET MAYBE TACKLING ARE EXACTLY THAT GOVERNMENT PEACE. OF SO. CENTER OF IS. NOT JUST SORT OF DOING THE MANAGED PORTION BUT ALSO SETTING THE RULES AROUND IT. AND TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR THERE IS NO INTENTION HERE OF VIOLATING ANY. GREAT YEAH I YEAH. BUT EVERY DAY THERE'S NO IMPLICATION THAT THAT DESIRE BACK YOU TRY THE IN THIS ACCIDENT. SO IT'S SORT OF OPEN THE FLOODGATES IN A LOT OF PROGRAMS UP HAVE A LOT OF SPECIAL RULES AROUND WHEN YOU CAN COMBINE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHERS SO THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A PROGRAM WILL HELP. DO YOU ACTUAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION BUT SENT ME CAN'T PROVIDE I'M WAS DAY. THEY DO THE EN EL SEND THAT AND- WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT WE LOOK TO FOR EFFICIENT. AND YOU KNOW AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES AND IMPROVE THAT- BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WERE. MORE NOT DOING THIS WITHOUT RULES AROUND HOW THAT LOOKS. AROUND SHARING PORTION OF IT THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL A WELL THOUGHT OUT UP. WITH THEY CALL ME THROW OVER TO PART NOT SURE THE CENTER ON ITS OWN BECAUSE THOSE. THOSE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A- SPECIFIC LAW. APPLIED TO VARIOUS PROGRAMS ALONG WITH REGULATIONS AND WE NEED TO BE PRESENT THOSE TO RECEIVE. THOSE SO THAT IT CALLED. IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION AND WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO DO THIS IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE PUBLIC TRUST EITHER YEAH AND I KNOW THAT AND SO I GUESS. THE ONE OF THE MY COST IS THAT SIR OFF TO COME THE TITLE IS IT STRIPS SO IS WHAT. THE CULTURE WILL. RIGHT AT THAT I KNOW ALL YOUR- ARE RIGHT. IN THE STATE BUT THIS THAT THE FIRST STAB AT CULTURE IS THE TO RIGHT OF THE GIVING THE STATE IN YOUR PUTTING. IN SO FORTH AND SO I SAYS CAUTION RIGHT AND HOPEFUL WE SHOULD THINK THIS THROUGH BIT ABOUT DOCTOR STATE'S JUST DOWN TO. IN HELPING KASHA BUT CANCER OF THE REAL ISSUE BE. NOW THESE EIGHT THREE AGENCIES THAT WERE MERGING INTO THISHOW HOW THEY WILL THEN SIT IN THE OFFICE WHICH WILL BE MORE TO THOSE THREE AS- IT. A POOR ONE THAT IS AT THE- TERM GEN. SO WE KIND OF. SURE WERE SET THEIR OBVIOUS THAT CULTURE. AND BY THE FEW DIRECTOR AND PEOPLE WHO SERVE IN THAT SAID BUT YEAH WE'RE SORT OF TOOK THE FOR STAB BY A THIRTEEN THE TITLE I WANT. OF ABOUT TITLE BY REALLY IS LIKE AND THEN THE ROLE OF THE P. WHO DO. BECAUSE ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE ARE THEIR YEAH ON TUESDAY HAS BEEN AN WILL NEED TO BE BUT OF THAT THEY'RE VERY CLOSE THEY STAND THEIR JOB IS NOT THE NO BUT IS MUCH IS THIS TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY AT LAWS AND- IS WHAT LETTER LOS. BUT ALSO. YOUR IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE END THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE BEING WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT ARE PROTECTING US GREATER THINGS. IT SAYS THAT- AND SO WITH THAT WHAT IS TODAY INTEGRITY AND THEN THERE IS THE PEACE I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID THAT WELL WE TAKE A PAUSE AND LOOKING AT. ABOUT IT SINCE FORCED AND IT AB YES MAYBE WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT DATA ENTIRELY RIGHT BUT I UP CONCERNED THAT WE TAKE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WILL EVENTUALLY GET LOST SO WE WILL NOT. THE CLEANUP A BETTER BUT ALSO. TO THAT IS BEING WHAT THE FUNCTION. BASICALLY MEANS NEED TO. BECAUSE NOW THERE'S NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT- AND SO I THINK I WILL BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT AS WELL. OKAY YEAH AND- YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR CAUTION WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND WE RECOGNIZE GO. FORWARD THAT WE NEED A VERY STRUCTURED FRAMEWORK AROUND GOVERNANCE AND GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT. ONE HIP. STARTED PEOPLE YOU SAID AS A REASON TO NOT SHARE PERMISSION. SO THAT. QUESTION WAS. WHAT SO. MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS OFF AS EXPLAINING HOW TO GET YES TO APPROPRIATELY SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH THIS- FOUNDATION AND FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNANCE AROUND IT SO WE ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGE QUESTION ON THAT. SORT OF CULTURE IT'S WE SEE IT AS HAVING A DUAL CULTURE ON ONE HAND IT'S THE OVERSIGHT. OVER PRIVATE THE HEALTH AND THAT AND THE OTHER PIECE AND ESSENTIALLY THE OVERSIGHT OVER DATA MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNMENT'S PEACE BUT ALSO THAN THIS PIECE WHERE HOW DO WE USE IN A WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO DO SOMETHING BETTER. WITH IN THAT FRAMEWORK. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT'S SOAK UP THAT UP WILL BE AN INTERESTING WAY OF DOING IT- BUT BUT YES WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE THERE MIGHT BE THE SUGGESTION OF A IT'S FREE FOR ALL BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OUR- YEAH THE CULTURE WILL. CULTURE OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS SORT OF A FIFTEEN PROVIDING SERVICES THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE SERVICES OKAY. SHE DEBT- BUT WHEN YOU DO YOU'LL MULTIPLE CULTURES IN THE QUESTIONS WHEN THEY'RE IN CONFLICT WHICH WHAT'S FOR ALL THAT. AND THAT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT SO ANYWAY LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT I'M SURE WILL I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHT ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS AND REFLECTIONS AND REVISIONS WHEN WE- IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS SO. SHE TO PRESENTATIONS THANK YOU THE- OKAY RIGHT BURN NEXT CAN TAKE UP ISSUE NUMBER FOR THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- I WOULD MAKE NOTE WHEN WE GIVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. YEAH WE JUST GOT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE EARLIER THIS WEEK SO WE'RE GOING TO DO AN INITIAL- WE'RE GONNA INITIALLY HERE THIS ISSUE BUT MY IT'S ALSO MY INTENTION- THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE PEOPLE. COME TO HEAR ABOUT THAT- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WILL I ALSO HEAR IT AGAIN BEFORE MAY REVISE- TO. DO A MORE THOROUGH THE- THAT THE PROPOSAL'S AND THERE MIGHT EVEN TO THOSE WHO MAY BE SOME REVISIONS ADDITION. BETWEEN NOW AND THEN TOO I WON'T THE RESTORATION CAN TELL ME WHAT A PLAN TO DO WHETHER THERE'S ANY. BUT THE PROBABILITY THAT IS BUT I CERTAINLY THINK YOU CAN WITH ALL. THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THE SERVER DESERVE FIRST CUT OVERVIEW AND GET AND- AND- EXPECT WE WILL HAVE YOU COME BACK AND- MORE DEEPLY INTO THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A- ALSO WITH. THE US THAT. OKAY SO ACTIVISTS TWO INTRODUCTIONS FIRST. THANK YOU AGENCY. I AM DR ALICE CHEN I SERVICE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR POLICY AND PLANNING AND DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL AFFAIRS AT THE AGENCY I THANK YOU L. L. BEN JOHNSON ALEJO YOU FINANCE RAMOS FINANCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WHICH GO IN FOR THAT YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US A SEPARATE NEED AT. PRESENT I. AND THEN BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO AGENDA ITEM THERE'S A CITATION OF A C. H. C. F. AND KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION POLL FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT FOUND THAT- THINK MORE THAN TWO OUT OF FIVE CALIFORNIANS REPORTED DELAYING OUR FOR GOING CARE BECAUSE OF COST CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IS A FIVE OH UP SURVEY JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR LAST MONTH WHICH SHOWS THAT NOW MORE THAN 50% OF CALIFORNIANS. MONTHS FOR GOING. ARE TELLING CARE SO- THIS IS A PRESSING ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS THE GROWING ISSUE ADDRESSING IT IS ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S TOP PRIORITIES AND OFFICES ONE OF IT HIT SIGNATURE OF PROPOSAL SO- I'M WALK TO THE PROPOSAL AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS AS I GO ALONG BUT IF I DON'T BRING THEM UP. PLEASE PROMISE. PROMISED FOR A GUIDING IS- THAT WE HAVE TO SET A TARGET- IF WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADED IT'LL BE HARD TO GET THERE. SO SENDING A STATEWIDE PER CAPITA COST TARGET FOR YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGIN IN HEALTHCARE COSTS THE SECOND IS- THEY WERE ALL IN ALL PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. I HAVE A ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PLAY IN MEANING THAT TARGET. THE THIRD IS ACCOUNTABLE- WHEN YOU TALK TO OTHER STATES THAT WERE- KIND OF NICELY OUTLINED IN THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS- THE HOPE- AND EXPECTATION IS THAT AS YOU SET A GOAL PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS WILL START ALIGNING TO THAT GOAL- END. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT I'LL GO THROUGH IN MORE DETAIL AS I WALKED THROUGH THE OFFICES RESPONSIBILITIES AND LAST. I'M REAL IN PART WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENSURE THE SAVINGS ACCRUE BACK TO CONSUMERS SO THOSE ARE THE POOR GUY. FALLS I'LL GO AHEAD AND REVIEW THE KEY COMPONENTS- IN TERMS OF THE ORGANIST OF OFFICE AND THEN REPORT THIS IS AGAIN A HIGH PRIORITY. FOR NINE IT WILL BE CALLS DOESN'T OFFICE WITH THE AGENCY. WITH THE DRY APPOINT. AN IN A LETTER NUMBER. THE BILL. UP THAT IS INTENDED TO HAVE BROUGHT EXPERTISE RIP OF THE DIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA THE BOARD ADVISES THE DIRECTOR IN ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THE OFFICES WORK- AND THERE IS A ROBUST PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EMBEDDED A AND ALL PROCESSES- IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGET. AT THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL- CONFORT LOOK IT- ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC INDICATOR SO DIFFERENT STATES OF LOOKED AT PERSPECTIVE STATE JUDY PDD PEOPLE'S MINDS URBAN CPI THEIR NUMBER OF ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC INDICATORS THE POINT IS NOT MADE UP THIS ACT BASED ON- ON. THE ACCEPTED A MEASURE- THEY'LL SET A STATEWIDE TARGET ON THE FORTY TO SAYS SECTOR SPECIFIC TARGETS AS WELL AS- HERE. HELLO THIS IS A AND SO THE STATE WIDE TARGET IS- THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AND DEPENDING ON THE DATA THAT COMES IN AND ANALYSIS- THE BOARD MAY THEN ADVISE GOING TO DIFFERENT SECTORS HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN'S PHARMA- OR STE FOCUS ON SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGION THERE IS A PUBLIC PROP. OF THE ADVISORY BOARD RECOMMENDS THE TARGET THE DIRECTOR THAN HOLDS AND THIS IS AGAIN BAGLEY KEENE MEETINGS- DIRECTOR HOLDS PUBLIC. A PUBLIC MEETING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT DISCUSSION AND THEN THE TARGET IS ACTUALLY ADOPTED AT A SUBSEQUENT MEETING SO THREE FORMS FOR COMMENT. THERE WAS ALSO C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE COPS TURN IT&lt;/c&gt;</u> INCLUDING GROUP THAN OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS. LOOKING AT AFFORDABILITY IS A KEY FOCUS OF THE OFFICE. AND IT'S COMPLICATED SO THEY WILL DEFINITELY BE TRACKING- AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF TOTAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS AGAIN THIS IS NOT FOR INSURED FOLKS BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HAVE COVERAGE ALL OUT OF POCKET COSTS PLUS EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION TO PREMIUM. WILL BE COLLATED AS A MEASURE OF AFFORD ANY AND THAT POINT TO- THE STEP SIZES TO REALLY MEASURE TRACK ANALYZE DOT. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TARGET BECAUSE YOU START A BENEFIT DESIGNED. AROUND THEM PLEASE SURE FREEMIUM. AND WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IF- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION. THE COST DATA STARTS WITH DATA SUBMISSION FROM PAYERS INCLUDING A RECIPIENTS- THIS AT THE OFFICE WILL ALSO HAVE THE FORTY. TO COLLECT DATA PROVIDERS IS NEEDED AND I JUST WANT TO CALL OUT THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO START OUT OF THE GATE- WAS COLLECTING DATA FOR THIS BEFORE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAPS WERE- AFTER ANALYZING THE DATA FROM PAYING BECAUSE THE SPEC. CATIONS WILL LIKELY CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR. THESE EXPECTS WILL BE ADOPTED BY EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND AGAIN THERE WILL BE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC MEETING- PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE REGULATION. THE OFFICE IS ALSO CHARGED WITH ANALYZING AND REPORTING ON THE DATA IT COLLECTS- BOTH THROUGH PUBLISHING AN ANNUAL REPORT AND HOLDING A PUBLIC MEETING- THE CONTENT OF THE ANNUAL PORT IS DELINEATED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. STRANDS TO EVERS. KING THERE ON TOWARD IMPACTS ON IT SAYS EQUITY QUALITY- ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WHICH WILL GET TO IN A SECOND BEST PRACTICES IMPACT ON WORK FORCE. AND AGAIN THERE'S A PUBLIC PROCESS EMBEDDED IN THIS WHERE- THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC MEETING TO PRESENT THE ANNUAL PORT OF THE ADDRESS FORDHAM BROADER PUBLIC. BARBER FOR EMPLOYMENT IN. BODIES AND THE REPORTING NICE TO JUST MEETING. YOUR QUESTION MILLION FORSMAN SO THE PRINCIPLE OF ENFORCEMENT IS THAT OF PROGRESSIVE- ENFORCEMENT. THERE WILL BE A FULL REGULATORY PROCESS HERE AND TO DEVELOP AND FOR SOME PROVISIONS. INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGY TIMELINE WARRANTED AND WARRANTED FACTORS TO PROCESS AN APPEALS BUT IT REALLY IT STARTS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF THE YEARS- THE DATA GETS COLLECTED IT GETS ANALYZE IF SOMEONE IS EXITING THE COST TARGET YOU SIT DOWN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REALLY TRADED. DOWN TO SEE WHAT IT THE DRIVERS- IF. THAT DOESN'T- MODIFYING THE TRAJECTORY- THERE ARE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON BY THE OPTION OF REQUIRE CORRECTIVE ACTION AND- IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN THERE. A CIVIL AND CIVIL PENALTIES TEST SO START WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PUBLIC HEARINGS CORRECT. PLANS CIVIL PENALTIES AND THEN ESCALATING CIVIL PENALTIES. AGAIN THE IDEA BEHIND THE PENALTIES IS THAT IT IS MEANT TO BENEFIT CONSUMERS- BY TRACKING FOR BUILDING A TRACKING PREMIUMS- TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING. THE MLR REBATE PROCESS- TO- MAKE SURE THAT THE ANY SAVINGS ACTUALLY TANGIBLY ACCRUE BACKED CONSUMERS BUT WE ARE- HAS A TEN ABOUT SENDING OUT A BUNCH OF FIVE DOLLAR CHECKS DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT. OTHER PARTS OF THE OFFICE- INCLUDE AGAIN FOCUSING ON WHAT WE THINK OF AS BALANCED SCORECARD MEASURES AS YOU FOCUS ON COST YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN INTENT CONSEQUENCES ON YOUR WORK FOR STILL. SIAN IT'S- LOOKING ACCESS QUALITY EQUITY IMPORTANTLY THERE'S A GOLDEN MINISTRY OF SIMPLIFICATION IT'S NOT ABOUT CREATING A BUNCH OF NEW MEASURES CREATING BUNCH OF NEW MANDATES ARE REALLY TRYING TO IDENTIFY PARDEE CORPSMAN IS THAT CAN BE USED- THERE'S A PROVISION ARE AT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT FALLS REALLY ONE AND WANTING TO OUR SYSTEM FROM FIFTY BUSINESS. STATION TO THE THEM AT IN THAT ROLE CAUGHT. STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR A PM- AND IN PARTICULAR FOCUSING ON PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTMENT- SHIRTS SAVINGS MODELS POPULATION BASE PAYMENTS. THE OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- TRACKING IS AROUND HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND HEALTH CARE WORK FOR STABILITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF LOWERING STANDARDS ARE ENCOURAGING LAYOFFS. AND WITH THE GOAL OF ENCOURAGING HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND AGAIN WE KNOW THAT AS WE LOOK AT BEST AND EFFICIENCY THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WILL. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A GLIDE PATH PEOPLE ENTER TRAINING AT THE TRAINING AND MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE AS A QUICK FOR THAT NEW AYE LANDSCAPE. AND THEN FOR ME OFFICE HAS CHART OF IN COSTA MARKET VIEWS. IT THERE'S A LOT OF CAN. ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS IN THE INDUSTRY THE INTENT IS TO HAVE A MORE PROACTIVE VIEW RATHER THAN CHASING THINGS AFTER THE HORSES LEFT. THE BARN AND IT HAS A VERY BROAD SCOPE LOOKING AT HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL CROSS INDUSTRY MERGERS AND MEAN AND- AND JUST A FILL IN THE GAPS SO IF THERE IS A REGULATORY AGENCY ARE READY THAT HAS THAT PER VIEW- THE OFFICE WILL NOT DUPLICATE THAT. WORK BUT WILL COORDINATE WITH THE- AGENT AND IF THERE IS A FINDING ONLY OR FOR. AG IN TERMS OF FINDING THERE'S A B. C. P. FORTHCOMING. THANK YOU AVAIL. GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE RELEASE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANALYSIS OF THIS TRAILER BILL AT THIS TIME WE WILL BE ANALYZING THE ISSUE OVER THE NEXT MONTH OR SO AND WE'LL BE SURE TO COMMUNICATE THAT ANALYSIS- TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST A NOTE- AS WELL THERE IS A POLICY BILL THAT IS MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS. THE TWO EIGHT TWENTY THAT WOULD STEP OFF THE AND CONCEPTUALLY IS QUITE SIMILAR TO TRAILER BILL BUT WITH THE A COUPLE KEY DIFFERENCES SOME BUT ULTIMATELY WE WILL PROVIDE AN ANALYST AT A LATER TIME I THANK YOU AND I SAID I THINK WE WILL. HAVE A JOB. AND SO WE- CERTAINLY- WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE BUDGET ARE THROUGH THE BILL I GUESS I WILL BE HEARING IT SOMEWHERE WHEN FORMER ANOTHER OKAY- A FINANCE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OKAY THANK YOU- HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AGAIN I THINK WE GOT DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO THIS. AT A FUTURE HEARING SO WE CAN GET ALL THE DETAILS BUT- SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DIRECTION PLANS IN. CIVIL PENALTIES AND SO FORTH WHICH ENTITIES AS THE SUPPLY TO BE SORT OF. REFER TO IMPLIED HEALTH PLANS BUT I MEAN I READ IT- SO YOU SET THE COST TARGET SO WHO WHO WHICH ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO. THESE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS CIVIL PENALTIES OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT FOR I GUESS I ASSUME FOR NOT MEETING OR EXCEEDING ACOSTA IT'S-A LOT OF THE DETAIL WILL BE WORKED OUT BY THE ADVISORY BOARD IN THE OFFICE- THE- CAN CONCEPT. IS THAT AS YOU LOOK AT THE PAIR LEVEL DAY AND IF THERE IS IF X. YOU. DRILL DOWN TO STATE IS IT DRIVEN BY. HOSPITAL COSTS BY FORMER BECAUSE BY. A WARRANTED COSTS CORONAVIRUS COSTS- AND FIGURE OUT- WHAT THE WARRANTED IN AN WARRANTED FACTORS ARE YOU BRING THOSE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN OCCUR IN ORDER TO. BEND THAT COST TARGET- AND THEN HAVE THE ENTITY THAT ACTUALLY IS IDENTIFIED AS A DRIVER TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. THAT'S THE GENERAL CONCEPT- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE WORK IN THE OFFICE OKAY. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE BETTER DEFINED SIMPLY BE KEY TO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE- ABOUT IT THEY CAN GO AROUND THEY GET ANYBODY IN THE- GOING AND PUT. YOUR FALL. EIGHT SO I THINK IT AT YOU FROM. FIND A BRING PEOPLE IN IN THE PEOPLE A START FINING PEOPLE I MEAN THAT TIME IS SOMEWHAT JAILING ANYONE DURING A FINE PEOPLE WE DEALT THE NEEDS AND- EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY A TRADE AND SO- I THINK IT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE FINE AND SIMPLE TO DO YOU SIT THERE ARE AND HUNTER AND SAVE BY THE WAY WE NOW THIS YOU NOW OPPOSE ON YOU PAIN RIGHT OF. QUESTION OTHER WAYS BUT IF THEY WERE NOT DOING YOU KNOW PROVIDING HONEST LABOR ON THE SERVICES- TO THEN TURN AROUND AND FIND THEM. BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE THE ONES ARE BEING BLAMED FOR SO I MEAN THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO FLESH THAT OUT A LOT MORE THAN SIMPLY A- YELL WILL HAVE AN END TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT. THAT A AND THEN I'M I'M A LAWYER BUT I DON'T WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE CIVIL FINES. THE PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE YEAH I'M I'M NOT SURE IN TERMS OF WHAT. YOU KNOW IN THE- THIRD PERSON THE FIGHT. IS RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS TO RIGHT. RIGHT I WOULD SAY THREE THINGS WERE ON A SERVICES RIGHT YEAH YEAH I THINK THREE THINGS ONE IS THAT THAT'S WHY THERE IS A FULL REGULATORY PROCESSES COULD. BE IN PLACE. TO FILL UP ANY OF THESE BILLS- WHICH WILL TAKE UP ONLY AT LEAST A YEAR WITH. CLEARLY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT AND- COMMENTS. AND GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LEGAL PROCESS INCLUDING THE APPEAL. AND IN THOSE PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT THE- PERSON UNDERSCORE. ARE THE AT INDUSTRY.TO IS. I MAY HAVE FIT THE END- EMPHASIZING THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF THIS. THE INTENT IS I MEAN. I KNOW RELIGION TENDS NOT TO SAY OH YOU DID THIS WE GO STRAIGHT. FIVE BUT IN. THE HOPE WE- THEN TEND TO. FIFTY CREDIT AND PLAN NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT FOR THAT RE HAVING THE DAY BY TRAINS MY HAVING CA. THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO LINE TO THAT GOAL AND THE REASON WE HAVE THAT HOPE ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE REMIND ME THAT CALIFORNIA RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM MASSACHUSETTS IS THERE THE GROUP THIS HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE AND FRANKLY THEY'VE NEVER EVEN GOTTEN TO A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SO AGAIN DON'T WATER EXPERT IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE. LARGER MORE DIVERSE IN COMP. EIGHT AND THERE SOME HELP FROM OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY THAT BY HAVING THIS TARGET BY HAVING THE DATA BY HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS. YOU'RE NOT RUSHING TO PENALTIES OKAY WELL I THINK IF WE IF WE ARE GIVING SOMEONE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE PENALTIES. FENDER SPEAK CLEARLY WAS ON HOW AND TO WHOM THOSE PENALTIES GET APPLIED AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SO PEOPLE ARE VERY CLEAR AS TO WHEN. THEY ARE IN PENALTY YOU KNOW THAT. THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO A PENALTY- SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE BUT AT SOME POINT ONCE YOU KNOW VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; YOU'RE SAYING ONE OF THE THINGS WE COULD DO IS NOW BANNED- THE AND THIRD THEIR NEED. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THEY CAN'T JUST LIKE FALL INTO IT GREAT SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- THE OTHER. THE YOU DID MENTION THAT THIS ALSO INCLUDES PRINCIPALLY ENDS THREE OF THE THIRTY TO INCLUDE RISA PLANS AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT SEEING AROUND IT SO IT REDUCES HIGH LEVEL PAYER DATA AND IN TALKING TO. THE STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDE- MASSACHUSETTS RHODE ISLAND DELAWARE AND- ORGAN ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THIS TYPE OF STATEWIDE COST TARGET- THERE HAS NOT YET BEEN ANY ISSUE. WITH REQUIRING AGAIN HIGH LEVEL DO WHEN WE'RE NOT TALKING AN H. P. THAT IS A TOLD THAT'S CLEARLY DELINEATED. PLANS ARE EXEMPT FROM A P. CITIES- THIS IS HIGH LIVER LEVEL DATA THAT AND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND WE'RE HOPING WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR US AS WELL. OKAY AND- ACTUALLY INTERESTING DETAIL TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE- BECAUSE- SO. WHEN THE DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS AND THEY THINK MEDICARE'S IDENTIFIED THIS IS THAT THE MORNING DEPEND PRACTITIONERS YOU HAVE THE MORE UTILIZATION YOU HAVE. THE MORE UTILIZATION YOU HAVE TO PRESS YES THE MORE INDEPENDENT ENTITIES YOU HAVE GOING AROUND DOING THINGS THE MORE UTILIZATION WE HAVE SO THAT. NOW IF YOU'RE IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA IT'S PROBABLY IS NEEDED UTILIZATION RATE SO THAT THEIR DUE TO AN ABSENCE ARE AT AN UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS- WE ALSO KNOW THAT CERTAIN AREAS BUT ALSO IF THAT'S- IF YOU'RE- DAD- IT IS. FIND PLAN I TWO OR FOUR THREE INCH BUT THAT'S- A SO ARE WE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS RELATE TO WORKFORCE AS WELL. I THINK THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED BY THE OFFICE I WILL NOTE QUE YOU LOOK IT AND COST TRENDS THE MOST OF IT IS NOT DRIVEN BY UTILIZATION. ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- FACT THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE INCREASED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN JEAN PIERRE WAGES OR ANY OTHER MEASURE MOST OF IT IS AROUND THE PRICES RATHER THAN UTILIZATION. OR DEMOGRAPHIC MAPS OR NOT SO WE HAVE IT'S WHAT'S THE MARGARET THE RIGHT AND- AS WE TRIED TO TOSS TRACK DID YOU MENTION THE GP BUT YOU GUESTS FOR. AGING BUT I DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM PART OF. WHAT THAT. IS TO BE DETERMINED. AS AN ENTRY. SO IT'S- RATE IT'S- IT ALSO DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S STICKING. NO SIR BROADLY DEFINED RATE SO WE GO FROM. X. RAYS A CT MRI IS RIGHT FOR- OR WE GO FROM YOU KNOW- IMMUNOGLOBULIN TO CIVIL THE IRATE. SO FORTHRIGHT SO YOU HAVE YOU OF IT DANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. AND YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORS OF THE PEOPLE ARE. OF THE SYSTEM RIGHT TERMS OF OKAY. SO IT I THINK IN THAT SO- THAT'S WHERE I MEAN IN IN HEALTH ECONOMICS I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY TALK ABOUT HOW PROVIDERS CAN GENERATOR AND- SO I AM IN THE MANNER. PRESS FIGHTER CANCER THAT GOES BACK TO THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT ACTIVISION HERBS AND HOW MANY WE HAVE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO DRIVE THEIR ON DEMAND WHAT DEGREES THAT DEMAND. OF INVERSES NEEDED RIGHT NOW IT'S HARD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO RIGHT SO TRY TO. THAT PIECE AS WELL. THE TRYING FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PIECE. THERE IN TERMS OF FIGURE OUT LIKE QUICKLY STRATEGICALLY PUT OUR RESOURCES HOW DO WE DIRECT THEM- AND YOU KNOW GOES. TO HOW DID AN APPROPRIATE GETS RIGHT YOU ARE YOU SEE ALSO THAT pWE'RE TALKING UP FRONT VIRUS DISTANTLY. BEFORE PANEL FOR THE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE. FIVE OR EIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT DEGREE DO WE TELL PEOPLE IT'S OUR A TRUCK THAT HE- WHEN YOU. I WAS READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW LOCAL HAAS HAD YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE GOT THEMSELVES IMMUNE OR FOOD FLU CASES EXPECTED THAT YEAR. RIGHT THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD OUTCOME BUT WASN'T GOOD FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CELL BECAUSE THAT YOUR ADMISSIONS RIGHT AND SO HOW THOSE KIND OF DYNAMICS WORK RIGHT IN TERMS OF. I'M FOR COP THING THEY'LL- JACQUELINE. NEXT THAT IS WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU PEOPLE BUILDING TWO BARS. SO HOW'S THAT SO LOOK AT WELL THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO DELVE INTO HIM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING AT THE- MORE DETAIL A LOT. OF LIKE TO WORK OUT WE GOT THE TRUCK THE ONE ON MY CELL AND THEY'LL- NEED TO DO TO NOT ASSIST. PROBLEM IN. TELLING I DON'T KNOW IS TO SELL. THAT YOU CAN'T AND I DON'T KNOW. SO I. WANT TO DEL INTO. TO THAT AND I YOU. RIGHT FOR OF THE OFF ARE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SEEN OUT BUT A LOT OF THE MATH THAT METHODOLOGIES FOR. I MEAN ARE GOING TO RELY ON THE X.OF THE PEOPLE STAFF THE OFFICE AND ADVISORY BOARD AND I THINK ANOTHER IS TO CALL OUT H. P. IT'S GONNA BE A- RESOURCE. THE THINGS YOU TO ABOUT IS IT OUR DURING BY NATION OR BY ARE BY SO BODY EUROPE YOU KNOW CURRENT OF OURS I THINKALL OF THAT WILL BE- OR A PARENT BY HAVE A GRANULAR DATE IN THE H. B. D. OKAY. SO I GUESS THE ONE OTHER THOUGH CASH FOR IT IS- ME SO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S- THERE WAS A LOT OF COMPLICATED THINGS. SOME OF IT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT DO PLACE AND BUT I THINK ALSO SO I SECTION WE'RE STARTING TALKING ABOUT LIKE SOME TOWN. AND BUT I THINK THE LED TO SO WANTS TO BE SURE WE ALL IN. NINE BUT THINGS. ALL THE- TURNED OUT REGULAR IN THAT WE ACTUALLY SLATE. IS TO. THE KEEP QUESTIONS THAT WOULD IN THE CODE. CLOSE SURE WE- TO VIEW IS AND ALSO TO AT TWO TWO ALSO GIVE TO WHAT WE YOU PLANE TO DO AND TO GIVE ALSO THE THAT'S WHAT THAT A CODE HAS THAT THIS IS. YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THE IN A REGULATIONS SO I THINK CAN WE DON'T BUY DISABLED AND FOR ALL THAT TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS I THINK WE WANT TO THE VET THAT. THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND THROUGH OUR THE- SEAT AT THREE BILL ARE ARE TO THIS PROCESS THE WORKING AT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. SO MUCH OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY ALL RIGHT IN FACT.

IF YOU'RE- AFTER ALL YOU HAVE AN OPINION WILL ON HERE IT SAYS OKAY. HOPEFULLY GOOD I DO IT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO ANYTHING IN ADDITION TO THAT IS NOT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I GOT THAT. BUT THEIR OPINION. SO OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND START MULTI PAYER PESTS PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME WORKING GROUP I ASK OF YOU CAN TRY PLEASE KEEP YOUR PRESENTATION TO THREE MINUTES OR LESS. AND WE HAVE MORE TIME FOR QUESTIONS OKAY THANKS TO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD- I'M ADAM FRANCE IN THE- OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS ALL RIGHT. PLEASE BEGIN. CAN YOU SEE TODAY ABOUT OUR MODEST PROPOSAL. WILL HELP BEEN COST CURVE. AND THEY CLOSER TO VALUE BASED PAYMENT- YOU'LL BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS SINCE YOU AUTHORED LEGISLATION SOME YEARS AGO AT. THIS TIME LEGISLATION ON THIS ISSUE- WE'RE LOOKING TO- TAP. TO JUST FOR TERRY WITH CONVENIENT WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF PAYERS PROVIDE. AND INSTEAD OF. EMPLOYMENT MORE. GRAMS AIMED AT CREATING A LINE FOR DEFENSE PRIMARY CARE. AND VALUE BASED PAYMENT. IS THIS TYPE OF ADVANCE TO LIMA REQUIRES VERY NARROW ANTITRUST LIABILITY WAIVERS THE STATE MUST BE INVOLVED. READING MULTI PLAYER PILOTS HELPPRIMARY CARE PRACTICES TRANSFORM TO ADVANCE PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES ALSO KNOWN AS PATIENTS AND OUR MEDICAL HOMES HAS BEEN PROVEN TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES. AS IN OTHER STATES LIKE NORTH AND COLORADO HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL THIS. CAL AYMAN UP ROSE OFFICE OF- HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY- WILL GET US THERE IN SEVERAL YEARS AND WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL CAN HELP BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR THOSE FOR THE ACTIVITY AND HELP DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES. CO IS LIKELY TO PLACE A CODE NINETY IS LIKELY TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT- BUDGET IMPACT ON OUR STATE AND ON FRONTLINE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THE WE NEED A CRUCIAL SUPPORT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FOR OVER. THE WILL HELP SAVE MONEY ON TRAINED PHYSICIANS THIS IS NECESSARY TO MANAGE THING FROM CURRENT DISEASES TO ADDRESSES. THIS MULTI STATE. TASK FORCE HAS THE POTENTIAL MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OUR STATES EFFORT TO SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND BEND THE COST CURVE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR HOPEFULLY FUTURES. AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM ALEJO. IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT- SO BASICALLY YOU'RE ASKING FOR ESSENTIALLY A- WELL WORKFORCE A CONVENER BECAUSE YOU KID FRIENDLY TRUST REASONS WE CAN'T THE ONLY STATE CAN PULL PEOPLE THE FROM THIS CORRECT IS SO FORTY. YOU SOME YEARS AGO DID OUR PCMH PROGRAM FRESNO RIGHT WHICH WAS WITH- ONE'S SELF INSURED PAYER AND SO THAT PRACTICE COULDN'T THEN GO TO ALL THE OTHER PAIRS ARE PART OF THAT MEDICAL PRACTICE AND SAY. LET'S WITH SOMETHING RIGHT. YOU NEED THE STATE TO OVERSEE THAT OF THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY IT'S VERY NARROW IN TERMS OF THE ANTITRUST LIABILITY BUT YOU STILL NEED THE STATE TO APPLY AND CONVENER THOSE GROUPS. AGAIN WE JUST HEARD FROM THE A PROPOSAL FROM THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY I THINK ONE OF THE ELEMENTS WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PAYMENT MODELS- YEAH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TOWARD THE FRESNO- PROGRAM. IT WAS ONE THAT- YOU KNOW THEY WERE ON THE CURVE TO BASICALLY BETTER MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE BUT ALSO SAVE MONEY- SO IT'S ALSO A YOU KNOW IT'S BASED APPROACH- TO CARE. CAPS SOME THAT YOU'RE ASKING HERE IN THIS PROPOSAL PERHAPS- BEING INCORPORATED ARE INTO- WORK WITH THE- THIS OFFICE SAYS THAT AS A WAY TO HELP- CONVENE PEOPLE TO TRY STEPS THE STANDARDS ACROSS PAYERS. WITHIN THE TO BEST AND AFFORDABILITY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY I THINK THERE'S- THIS THIS TASK FORCE COULD HAVE A LOT OF- BENEFIT ACROSS TO PROGRAMS- PARTICULARLY THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND POSSIBLY CAL AIMED. I THINK EIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP INTO THAT I THINK- CERTAINLY IT'S A VERY BIG PROJECT THAT THE STATE- IS PROPOSING AN AND ONE THAT WE SUPPORT CERTAINLY IN CONTROLLING COST AND BELIEVE THIS IS A SMALL STEP THAT CAN HELP GET THEIR- IN FRESNO. SIDE WE HAD MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO I'VE I THINK AS WE CAN FILL THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BEEN TO DO ADDRESSING COSTS OKAY. SHEET THAT I KNOW THAT- WAY BACK WHEN I WAS- ASSEMBLY HEALTH CARE AND I WAS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE- WE ACTUALLY HAD A HEARING AROUND- PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME AND THE BAD BETTER MAGIC CHRONIC CONDITIONS. I NOTED THAT WE PRESENTED A REPORT THAT HAD SEVERAL PAGES OF PILOTS EACH FILE FILE CARD THE ONLY TWO LINES OF PRIDE LIKE. THE THIRTY SOME LET'S SHOULD. YEAH BURKE LOWER COST SO FOR THE MIKE WAS WHY ARE TAKE TAKING THESE SCALE WHY IT'S EVERY A PILOT WITH DOING AFTER PILOTS A PILOT THAT ALL SHOWS THE SAME THING WE'RE GETTING REALLY GOOD RESULTS YET IT DOESN'T GO TO HELP PEOPLE TAKING IT SCALE. FUNNY IT SCALES SO WE THINK ABOUT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH THAT IF YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION STILL SHE STILL HERE THEY OP AFFORDABILITY AT DIFFERENT CLUBS BUT IT SET AT THAT VALUE BASED PURCHASING WHICH THEIR PER IS A IS A IS A IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT- I MEAN I THINK THE- WE DO. YEAH TO A- TWO. THERE WERE NOT FILING A TRY BUT ALSO BE ISSUE RECORD I MEAN THINK THAT'S OF AT LEAST AS HEARD OFFICE OF FOR LIKE THIS IS LIKE HOW DO WE EVERY TOGETHER TO THINK OF HOW WE NOW HE SETS ARE BUT AND THE COST CURVE. PEOPLE ARE YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL BUT LIKE WHAT IS WE CAN TRY TO DO PROVIDE TO DO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF A YEAH WE CAN LEAVE THAT MAKE THIS SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED AND YEAH OUR HOPE IS THAT BY INCLUDE THE STATE ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN ONE WORKING GROUP YOU CAN REALY BUILD THE TRUST AND MOVE TOWARD SKATE INSTEAD OF JUST. ONE IN OTHER OTHER PEOPLE IN THE IN IT PATIENT SELF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW THIS IS SO WE CAN MAKE THIS PART OF AN INTEGRATED INTO A- INTO- INTO SOME OF THE OTHER ACT.

EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND THEN IF THEY PREFERRED INTO THE SPECIALLY MENTAL SYSTEMS AND HELP MANAGE CARE PLAN IF IT'S A KID. FOR COVERAGE OF THE WAR EVEN IN A MEDICAL ME. COURTNEY CARE BUT MINISTER I PRIVATE PSYCHIATRIST OR WHETHER IT'S BY CAN PROVIDER SO THAT SYSTEM ALL REMAINS IN PLACE WITH THIS IS A- GETTING RAINING. AND RESOURCE TO THE PRIME.

FULL ARE INTEGRATED TWO WAY WE- OR SO GET THE FEDERAL MATCHING TYPES OF THINGS TO. THE MENTAL HEALTH IN PROVIDING THIS SERVICE ONGOING BASIS RIGHT WHAT A COUPLE DIFFERENT POINTS COUPLE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THERE SO FIRST I WOULD SAY WE'RE NOT CLOSED OFF TO I THINK THAT THERE MAY BE A PATCHWORK OF FUNDING THE COULD BE PULLED TOGETHER TO FUND AS WE DID GENERAL FUND BECAUSE WE IS ALREADY CONVERSATION GOING ON AROUND THE HELL AND MAKE SHOULD BE DISCOUNT. ARE THE- WE HAVE JACKSON. WE DID BURKE COUNTY MAY BE OCT TO A PRO AND HAVE FIFTH EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS LIKE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT HAVING HAPPENED SO CREATING A STATEWIDE ON THIS IS CALIFORNIA WE- WELL THE LOCAL CONTROL RIGHT. OKAY SOMETIMES WE WANT A LITTLE LITTLE BIT OF GUIDANCE SO PUTTING UNDER THE OFFICE OF AND THE AGENCY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ALL OF THEM TO KIND OF STANDARDIZED CREATE ONE WEBSITE. IS TO THE UPS AND MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER GUIDANCE WHEN THE PRIMARY KERR WRITERS IS UNIFORM RATHER THAN HAVING IT HAPPEN FIFTY EIGHT WAY AND WE FUND THAT. WE CAN OFTEN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TO PULL FROM PEOPLE WHO WE THINK ALREADY HAVE SCARCE RESOURCES BUT OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO PULL THE FUNDING TOGETHER. THE REASON WE PROPOSED YEARS IS TO GIVE THE- ON. FOR STATUS. I AM SO TRUST. OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND GET THEM INTO THE PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND THEY DON'T. JUST BECAUSE YOU OFFER THEM A LINE OR YOU OFFER THEM A PROJECT ECHO. OPPORTUNITY AND SO. MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S TIME FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE ALSO KNOW UTILIZATION IS HIGHER IN THE BEGINNING. THE CALL A LOT I FOR. THE PROGRAM AND AS THEIR KNOWLEDGE. THE LAST. MAN THE CARD WILL GO.

ARMORS THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE BY HEALTH AND SAFETY. CODE TWO POINT FIVE WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM WITH THEM SO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL STATE ACTIVITIES. CONCERNING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF A AND EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT- EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. AND THAT IS A VERY SMALL DEPARTMENT BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT FALL INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE OVER SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND CERTIFIED EMTS AND NEARLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND LICENSE PARAMEDICS THAT RESPOND TO ABOUT. FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION NINE ONE ONE CALLS. EMERGENCY SERVICES ANNUALLY AND WITH FORTY TWO. HUNDRED GROUND AMBULANCES AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN AIR AMBULANCES. SPECIFICALLY MS IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LICENSING OF PARAMEDICS AND DISCIPLINING THOSE LICENSES WHEN NECESSARY AND ENTERTAINING THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE TRAINING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR ALL EMS LEVELS INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY FOR STATE. CALIFORNIA EMS IS A TWO TIERED SYSTEM BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AM SAID DEVELOPS GUIDELINES AND APPROVES PLANS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATED BY THIRTY THREE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. I AM SO ALSO DEVELOPS REGULATIONS FOR THE DESIGN AND CALL QUALITY OF SPECIALTY CARE SYSTEMS A TRAUMA SYSTEM PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE CENTERS A STROKE SYSTEM CARDIAC SYSTEMS AND A CITY WIDE POISON CONTROL SYSTEM. THE THIRD MAJOR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY IS THE DISASTER MEDICAL SERVICES. WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO BUILD A PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE EMERGENCY FUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO PLAN FOR THE MEDICAL IMPACT OF ANY TYPE OF DISASTER OR HEALTH EMERGENCY. RECALL GO AHEAD AND GO INTO THE BUDGET AND BCP'S IF THAT'S OKAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE RELEASED IN JANUARY INCLUDES EXPENSE REPORTING AMOUNT OF THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION. IN SEVENTY POINT A PERMANENTPOSITIONS OF THIS AMOUNT SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION OR FORTY SIX PERSONS DELEGATED FOR STATE OPERATIONS IN NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION OR 56% FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. BUT WE HAVE PROPOSALS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DURATION FOR. HIS FOR A CUSTOMER HEALTH RESPONSE LOCAL SO WE'RE GONNA- SINCE IS PARTY OF REVIEW WHEN WE GET TO THOSE TWO AREAS WILL DELVE INTO THAT OFF. OKAY ANYTHING. YOU AND I THINK WE DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SUSPECT. IN THE STATE SCORED A RESPONSE WITH OF IN NINETEEN AS YOU CAN DRESS THAT I KNOW THAT THE DIRECTORS BUSY DOING THAT RIGHT NOW IF I DO I JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THAT. SIR I'M STILL AS FAR AS AN FULLER SPOTS ABILITIES. EIGHT INFECTIOUS DISEASE PACKED MA WE ARE CERTAINLYINTEGRATED WITH THE EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION EIGHT MEDICAL HEALTH A MEDICAL. OR THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN. MORE WORK CAN CURRENTLY WITH THE LOCAL RENT. AND STATE AND FEDERAL PART OR STRIPPING THE- PLAN MANY RISKS NUMBER. SO WE HAVE A MAJOR AREAS FOR WORKING ON PREPAREDNESS AND COMMUNITY XIN SERVER ONCE AND DETECT. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE STAFFING AND ALL STATE OPERATIONAL CENTERS THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER. OUR DEPARTMENT. OPERATIONS CENTER AND ALSO THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER LOCATED IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. WE ARE COORDINATING A TO POINT AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS ROSTERING AND COORDINATING THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM. MEMBERS FOR TO PLAY IN IN ENSURING MEDICAL SHELTERS ARE PRESSED TO BE DID FLOYD. COOPERATING PATIENT TRANSFERS TO QUARANTINE CENTERS OR HOSPITALS AND WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS.

TO EXECUTE THOSE TRANSPORTS USING MULTIPLE AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS.

THEM SAYS ALSO DEPLOYED SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE CAL MATT TO ATTEND TO GUESS AT DESIGNATED QUARANTINE CENTERS. AND PHILLIP AND SAYS IMPLEMENTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ALLOWING LOCAL EMS AGENCIES TO UTILIZE PARAMEDICS TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO MEDICAL FACILITIES OTHER THAN GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND ALLOWING FOR THE USE OF OUT OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS NOW. AS DEFINED IN THE EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION. THANK YOU LU COMMENTS. SENATE PARTICULARLY- JUST ONE ISSUE- THAT WE WOULD RAISE IS THAT THE- BACK BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL COME UP ANYWHERE ELSE. AND SO HAS THE EMERGENCY SHELTERS FOR USE IN TIMES LIKE THIS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ALSO WANTED TO DEPLOY A SOME OF THOSE SHELTERS TO HANDLE HOMELESSNESS AND SOME OF THE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SOME OF THOSE SHELTERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED IN OAKLAND AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IN- THAT WOULD COME UP IS WHETHER OR NOT ENOUGH FOR THE SHELTERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN RESPONSE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. ALL RIGHT THANKS A FINANCE AND GOVERNMENT ALL RIGHT WELL MAYBE IF THEY CAN ARE YOU ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SO. AS A HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS ALL RIGHT AND- WE ALSO HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST AT THIS POINT JUST READING THE NEWS AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THIS IS THAT OF COURSE ARE FINDING ALTERNATIVE. FACILITIES TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER CONTACTS ARE WHO HAVE CORONAVIRUS AND DON'T REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION BUT- DO YOU SEE A NEED FOR. THAT WERE USING THE SHELTERS ARE READY THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE SO THE EMERGENCY SHELTERS. THAT SAYS A RAINY CONVERSATION AND SAID ABOUT THE THESE AMER SHELTER THAT- THAT I GUESS ARE UNDER YOUR SECTION. SURE IS. IN THE MOBILE SHELTER. AS YOU KNOW WAS BORN OUT OF THE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITAL PROGRAM AND WE HAD THREE SETS OF TWO HUNDRED AT BED HOSPITALS COMPLETE EACH. AND WE BROKE THOSE DOWN SOME OF THOSE DOWN WEEK WE ARE RETAINING ONE FULL TWO HUNDRED BED AT OUR STATION AND THEN WE HAVE ONE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR USE. AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE REMAINING HOLE. OF TWO HUNDRED INTO SIX MODULE THAT WE'VE PLACED STRATEGICALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR LOCALS TO USE- CURRENTLY WITH THE- HOMELESS UP PROGRAM WE ONLY A FEW THAT ARE LOAN TO THAT ENDEAVOR AT THIS MOMENT- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY SET. AT THE- IS IT NEEDED QUARANTINE SITE USING THEIR- EIGHT PROPER CENTER SO I BELIEVE IF WE- EIGHT. ALTER OUR RED DID THE ONE AT THE READY IF NEED TO WE HAVE USED THESE SHELTER IN THE- FOR. PARKS PLAY. WE DOES ISOLA TEN. STATE AREA THE COURTNEY. USE JUST. SO WE HAVE THOSE. RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE SINGLE AND AS DEPENDENCY ON THOSE. I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW BUT IT CHANGE AT THEM. EVERY YOU KNOW OUR IS DIFFERENT SO- THERE MAY BE AS- THE STRESS ON THOSE RESOURCES BUT FOR RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH TO COVER WHAT WE'VE BEEN OBLIGATED TO SO FAR. AND CERTAINLY LET ME ONE THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PROJECTED FUTURE AS FAR AS I KNOW THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW BUT SCENES REJECTED IT'S HAPPENED IN. OTHER COUNTRIES- SUES THE SAMPLE THE MOBILE HOSPITAL- IT IS EQUIPPED SO THE NECESSARY TO BE USED TO AS SIR CASSIDY OF WE HAVE AN AREA THAT'S HARD HIT BY A CODE NINETEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY A FEW UNPAYABLE. YOU KNOW HOW IT OF SENIORS IN THE HOSPITAL LOCAL HOSPITALS- BASICALLY PASS THESE OVER OVER RUN- IS THAT DESERVE. AS IS A RENTS OF THOUGHT ABOUT A WHETHER THAT'S AN ASSET THAT'S GONNA BE USABLE FOR THAT FUNCTION AT THE MOMENT THE- SH. ARE WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO EAT THE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FILTERS IT. WE WAS BUILT AWESOME WE HAD A MET. I QUICK IN A SERVICE IN MAINTENANCE THAT. MADE IT TO. IT NEEDS. STATIC SENSE SO IT'S JUST DURABLE EQUIPMENT AND THEMSELVES OKAY IS THIS IS ANY AT THIS MOMENT WITH THIS PURELY NEED AT THIS MOMENT WE DON'T KNOW IN THE FUTURE IS THERE SOME DISCUSSION I THOUGHT ABOUT. I TEND TO USE. THE QUICK TO IF WE NEED SEARCH TO PAY. I MEAN IS THAT IT MAY NOT BE READY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW BUT ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT EVEN THE EVEN NOTHING ELSE IT'S THE PRESSURING THE HOSPITAL FEEL WITH BABY LESS BILL CASES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT STILL NEED HOSPITALIZATION SO I WASN'T SURE WHETHER DOES. SOME PREPARATION WORKERS AN EXAMINATION OF THE ASSETS. AT UMASS ASSETS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE- THE OUT BREAK. OUT WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO- REVITALIZED THAT PROGRAM SO IT IS CERTAINLY HAS BEEN ON. THE TOP OF OUR MINDS OKAY SO THERE'S WORK BEING DONE TO EXAMINE YOUR EXISTS CURRENT ASSETS AND THINK ABOUT WHERE THIS THING. ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT WHAT RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE OUT FOR OURSELVES AS WELL AS A FEDERAL INNER AND LOCAL PARTNERS OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL. I MEAN I THINK. JUST TO. EIGHT RIGHT BEING BEING AND HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN'T COME TO THAT BUT- IT IS THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT- IF THERE'S A SUDDEN INCREASE AND- WE'LL WERE SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED BY A LACK OF AVAILABLE TESTING- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN DELAYS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WITH. TESTING AND SO FORTH AND WE HAVE COMMITTEESPREAD RIGHT NOW WE'RE HOPING THAT IF EVERYONE DOES THEIR JOB AND WE DO SOCIAL THAT SINGS OF WHAT WE CAN SLOW THE- SPREAD OF THE OUTBREAK SUFFICIENT. WE DON'T OVER TAX OUR- I SEE OF OUR HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS HOSPITALS AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT- WE MAY USE THAT THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN- AND THAT- SO PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR WHAT OTHER ASSETS WE HAVE TO TRY TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE IN THAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ALL. RIGHT OKAY- AND THEN OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- AGAIN I KNOW YOU'RE THE OVERSIGHT BUT- IS- CONCERNS IN TERMS OF IT. OF SO WE'VE HEARD FROM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS ABOUT THE- LACQUER OF SUB PROTECT. QUIT MEN'S- SO FIRST TECH TO ACQUIT MEANT. IS THAT SOMETHING WERE HEARING FROM- FOLKS IN THE FIELD IT IS CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING SUFFICIENT PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR OUR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT THEY HAVE TO GO IN AN AREA DEL THE FACILITY WHERE SOMEONE'S BEEN TESTED POSITIVE FOR. A FOR CODE- NINETEEN. IT TO. TELL YOU HEARING FROM THE FOLKS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF PROTECTIVE. THE OPPOSITION PUT MEANT PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT THE- PEOPLE WONDER. OUT IN THE FIELD IF YOU NEED TO AGAIN PROVIDE. CARE TRANSPORT SOMEONE WHO HAS- COVER NINETEEN OR MAY POTENTIALLY HABIT. WE KNOW THAT DOCTOR DUNCAN HAS- BEEN IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THEM LOCAL EMS ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE THEN- HAVE CONNECTION AN OVERSIGHT OVER HIM AND PROVIDE IN THEIR AREAS. AND SO I KNOW THOSE. THINGS ARE FLOWING BOTH WAYS- I HAVE NOT HEARD OF A REQUEST AT THIS POINT IN TIME- THAT THERE IS A DECLINE. OF JOHN- JOHN TRASK HERE- DO YOU WANT TO. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- YES- WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE LOCALS COMING UP TO THE STATE AND THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF MANY PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT I. STONE THERE IS. MMA ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL JUST- YET DIVS THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE AND- WE'VE HEARD KNOWS WE'VE WE KNOW SOME. THAT THE LEAST- SOME HOSPITAL STAFF- IT'S ZERO FOURTH HAVE INDICATED THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY FOR EXAMPLE LIKE MASKS HAVE BEEN SHORT SUPPLY BECAUSE OF AN BY THEM UP. AND SO- WHEN OUR ABOUT THE TOILET PAPER PART OF THINGS FROM THE HEALTH CARE AND BUT- BUT- WE DO SEE THE SHORTAGES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS AND- AND OBVIOUSLY. WITH THIS PURPOSE DISEASE NOT ONLY OF COURSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD DESTRUCTION SUPPLY CHAINS. YOU KNOW I'D- WELL I KNOW THAT WORD. THE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF COULD END OF COURSE HAVING PERHAPS HAVING TO TRIAGE SUPPLIES BUGS THE MANY DIFFERENT. BILL PROFESSIONALS WHO MIGHT DEMANDED BUT CLEARLY WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR FRONTLINE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO MAY BE ASKED TO GO AND- PROVIDE CARE TRANSPORT FOR PATIENTS. WELL THE PLEASE KEEP US SURPRISED IF THAT AS THE DAY GOES ON AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION SO. RIGHT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT BULLETS.

THE AVAILABLE COLLECTING AND MAKING THAT DATA AVAILABLE IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE WANTED. TO THE FOR. USE THE DRESS YEAH. YOU KNOW I.

THE THAT DON'T SERVE HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THINGS THE STATE EVEN DONE ARE THINGS THAT USED TO STATING THAT YOU'LL BE DETAINED X. HERE ARE- THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO ANY EXERCISE. TRY TO KEEP THIS THAT WERE UNDER. ABOUT OUR REPORTS ARE BE PEAS SO I'M TO JUST PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S MISSION IN OUR BUDGET- OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS HEALTHCARE RIGHTS INSURANCE ABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WE LICENSE AND REGULATE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN HEALTH PLANS. THAT PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE TO MORE THAN TWENTY SIX MILLION CONSUMERS WE REGULATE MORE NINE SIX FOR THE COMMERCIALAND GOVERNMENT HEALTH PLAN ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE- OF THE DEBATE. TOTAL PER. SCHOOL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET IS NINETY THREE POINTS. IN AND OF. AND THE OPERATOR POSITION. THAT IT FOODS ARE FOR BE. WHICH OUT ABOUT THREE SIX MILLION AND EIGHT AND A HALF POSITIONS. BUT APARTMENT ESPECIALLY FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON HEALTH PLANS AND RECEIVES NO GENERAL FUND ME- IN TERMS OF NEW PROJECTS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY NEW PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS UP I KNOW THE- NUMBER OF HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS WILL BE ON GOING FOR TH DEPARTMENT- I'D BE HAPPY TO GO THROUGH EACH OF OUR PROGRAM AREAS BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A SUMMARY ALL. I'D LIKE A GOOD. RECORD ABOUT OUR- PARTS. OKAY YES WHAT GO AND DO THAT OKAY SO TART STARTING WITH OUR TIMELY ACCESS REPORT FOR MEASUREMENT YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN- I'D LIKE TO JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT TAKES TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE VERY SERIOUSLY WORK BETTER TO HOLDING HEALTH PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TIMELY ACCESS TO POINT WAIT TIME AND NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS CONTAINED IN THE KNOX KEEN ACT. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WE RELEASED OUR TIMLY ACCESS REPORT FOR MEASURE YOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN- HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT WHICH INCLUDED THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL SURVEYED PROVIDERS WHAT APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE WITHIN WAIT TIMES STANDARD FOR BOTH OF AN HONOR TO APPOINTMENTS FROM PERSON PAUL SURVEYED HAD APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE STANDARDS RANGED FROM 94% APPOINTMENTS THAT PERSONS OF ALL SURVEYED PROVIDERS TO HAVE APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE IN THE STANDARDS RANGE FROM 83% 257% IN REGARD. TO OUR BUT HEALTH PLAN THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE WAIT TIME STANDARDS FOR BOTH URGENT AND NON URGENT RANGED FROM 80% TO SEVENTY THREE PERCENT. FOR NON URGENT APPOINTMENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVIDERS THAT MET THE STANDARD WORK OP RANGE FROM 90% TO EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. AND THEN FOR URGENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT APPOINTMENTS OF IT WITHIN WAIT. UNDER RANGE YEAR PROBABLY THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO WE WILL BE PROMULGATING A REGULATION TO ESTABLISH A RATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. THAT ALL HEALTH PLANS MUST MEET ONCE THE REGULATIONS ADOPTED THE D. MHC WILL HAVE A STANDARD TO WHICH HEALTH PLANS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WE WERE ABLE TO COMPARE HEALTH PLAN PERFORMED ACROSS THE PLAN AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLAN PERFORMANCE YEAR OVER YEAR. THE FOLLOWING SURVEY BUT THE METHODOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN OUR REGULATE. I JUST OF THE COUPONS. UP TO REDUCE PER BURKE HEALTH PLAN USE SINGLE. EIGHT PROVIDER SURVEYS ON BEHALF OF. MANY OF ON SO WE CAN REDUCE. ALSO WERE IN CURBING HEALTH TO USE A DE MATH OTHER THAN PHONE CALLS TO OBTAIN APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY INFORMATION. AGAIN TRYING TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON PROVIDERS ARE ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS- WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGING COORDINATION EFFORTS BY HEALTH PLANS TO ADVISE PROVIDERS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPONDING TO THESE SURVEYS WE NEED TO GET A GOOD RESPONSE TO ASSESS AVAILABILITY ALL. ALLOW FOR SURE SOME VISIT. RIGHT PRIVATE CARE PROVIDER SAM AND AGAIN- THE PROPOSED REGULATION WILL ALSO INCLUDE A RATE OF COMPLAINTS STANDARD THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO EACH HEALTH PLAN'S NETWORK- THIS IS A DISTINCTION FROM HOW WE CURRENTLY REPORTS THE DATA WE'RE REPORTING NOT AFTER AGGREGATE LEVEL. SO MEASURE IN THE RATE OF COMPLAINTS AT THE NETWORK LEVEL WILL ALLOW US TO- REALLY MEASURE ENROLLEES ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES BASED ON THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL AVAILABLE SO THAT ALL NETWORKS MOST HEALTH PLANS ALREADY SUBMITTED THIS WAY. AND FOR SYSTEM SEE THIS WILL ALLOW US TO LOOK AT HOW WE CURRENTLY COLLECT AT FOUR I KNOW NETWORK IN THAT PROCESS WE EVALUATE THE NUMBERS TYPES AND LOCATIONS OF PROVIDERS IN A SPECIFIC NETWORK- THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW US. SPECIFIC FEED TO THE HEALTH PLANS WERE WHICH PROVIDER TYPE THEN A NAP IN WHICH SIR. AS NOT THE TIMELY ARE STANDARDS AND IT WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION WHEN PLANTS ARE NOT MEETING THE RATE FINANCING. REQUIRE DIVAC SPLIT IN. AND TESTING SHOP PLEASE. OVER THE PAST BUT FEW YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH INCLUDING OUT THE HEALTH PLAN AND PRO. TO DO US METHODOLOGY AND RATE OF CA. THE DEBATE SEE WHAT MOVIE FORM REGULATION PROCESS IN THE SPRING AND STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED RIGHT AND THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST REPORT AND ACTIONS CAN MOVE B SIX REPORT IS SEVENTEEN TO GO FINISH EVERYTHING IN WE'LL ASK SOUNDS GOOD OKAY. OF SO SB SEVENTEEN- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GOV BROWN I'M SIGNED S. SEVENTY LAW WITH THE GOOD INCREASING TRAIN THE PROVIDING THE PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOW SCRIPT AND RIGHT OR IMPACT THE OKAY. AS SEVENTY REQUIRES HELP BY RATED XIN WITH THE DIEM TO A REPORT SPECIFIC DATA RELATED TO COST COVERED. DRUGS THE BILL ALL REQUIRES A DAMAGE TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL. I'M RIGHT DATA AT THE IMPACT PER DRUG COSTS AND HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS. ANNUALLY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS MUST REPORT THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY DRUGS BY TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING AND THE TWENTY FIVE DRUGS WITH THE HIGHEST. IN YEAR IN TOTAL IN. THEN BY CHORUS GENERIC BRAND SPECIALTY DROPS. HEALTH PLAN ALSO REPORTED IT. ROTH AFTER COSTS AND HELP PREMIUMS. TO DATE THE DAY THE RELEASED RE THAT SOME. INFORMATION WITH THEM RECENT BEING RELEASED IN JANUARY AGAIN OF THE SHARE. THE DMA SEES REPORT FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTING YOU PUT INFORMATION FOR TWENTY SIX HEALTH PLANS. THEY COVER APPROXIMATELY TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA. IN DEVELOPING THE REPORT THE DMA TO CONSIDER THE TOTAL VOLUME OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PRESCRIBED AND THE TOTAL COST BY HEALTH PLANS THESE DRUGS. ON BOTH AN APT SPENING LEVEL PER MEMBER PER MY- THEY SAID. I'M ALL. BUT THE IN THIS REPORT NODDING COSTS FOR PRESS DRUG ADMINISTERED IN A HOSPITAL OR A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR OTHERWISE PAID FOR THROUGH A CAPITATED ARRANGEMENT. SO THIS ONLY INCLUDES COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED AT A RETAIL OR MAIL PHARMACY. THE INFORMATION WE'VE COLLECTED SO FAR SHOWS THE IMPACT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND PREMIUMS IS SIGNIFICANT. IN THE DEER MEAT SEES MOST RECENT REPORT HEALTH PLANS REPORTED PAY NEARLY NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS REPRESENTED AN INCREASE OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHILE THE PERCENTAGE OF HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM THAT WENT TOWARDS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WENT DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM TWELVE POINT 9% AND TWENTY. TWELVE POINT 77% TWENTY EIGHTEEN. LANCE XIN BROKAW INCREASED BY FOUR POINT COMPARISON MEDICAL EXPENSES ONLY INCREASE BY TWO POINT 7% TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OVERALL TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS INCREASED SIX POINT 2% FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHILE SPECIALTY DRUGS ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 2% OF ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED THEY COUNT FOR OVER HALF OF TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AT THE SAME TIME GENERIC DRUGS ACCOUNTED AND ALL THE PRESIDENT A LITTLE OVER 22% OF TOTAL IN SPENDING NUMBER XIN DRUGS. AND BRICK NAMES PARKS WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ELEVEN POINT FOUR. NO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. A COUPLE OF JUST KEY FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT THAT ALL ADD- REBATES FROM DRUG DRUG MANUFACTURERS TOTALED OVERAL A LITTLE OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. UP FROM ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- THIS IS ABOUT ELEVEN POINT 7% OF THE NINE POINT ONE BILLION SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS ENROLLEES PAID THREE PER THREE POINT 1% OF THE COST OF SPECIALTY DRUGS. TWELVE POINT DRUGS AND FIFTY FIVE POINT 7% OF THE COST OF GENERICS. THE HEALTH PLANS PAID THE REST. THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS REPRESENTED FORTY EIGHT POINT 2% OF ALL DRUG. DRUGS PRESCRIBED AND APPROXIMATELY FORTY THREE POINT ANOTHER BOTH SEVEN PER TOTAL. IN THE SPENT ON FOR. DRUGS THE FIVE MOST COST DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR SIX POINT PER. I WOULD NOTE THAT SB SEVEN. IMPOSE SEPARATE REQUIREMENTS ON HEALTH PLANS THAT FALL RATES IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO FILE INFORMATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS- IT'S NOT IN OUR SB SEVENTEEN REPORT BUT WE DID INCLUDE INFORMATION OUR PUBLIC MEETING. THAT WE HAD IT ON LARGE GROUP RATES AND WE JUST HAD THAT MEETING LAST WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO- AND THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW BEST BE SEVEN TO REPORT I BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR MOVE ON TO THE B. C. PEAS. OKAY WELL IT'S- SO COMES MILLION. REVIEW AND RIGHT FINANCE RIGHT. SO I DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT- REPORTS OF FIRST OF ALL ON THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS- I KNOW THIS IS. STUDIES BEEN ONE THAT'S BEEN FRAUGHT WITH CHALLENGES. BECAUSE I FIRST HEARD THIS OF BASICALLY. THE SAID WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY DATA. RIGHT AND SO AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THIS YEAR OLD BY WELL COUPLE YEAR LAG ALL RIGHT- SO IN REGARDS TO FIRST OF ALL THE DATA COLLECTION- AND THE- AND THE VALIDITY OF THE DATA- SO CLEARLY WE YOU KNOW THE TRUST MANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND YOU TALKED ABOUT ACTUALLYTRY TO EXPAND THE WAYS OF COLLECTING IT TO TRY TO MINIMIZE- BY. YOUR RESPONSE BRITAIN HAS WE GET MORE. AFTER I PRACTICE AND THEY ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS YOU LOOK AT A GO I DON'T KNOW. TEAR GAS UP OF PRACTICE MANAGER BECAUSE YOU'RE WHAT IT TAKES ALL THE PHONE CALLS I'M JUST TOO BUSY SEEING PATIENTS. KEEP TRACK OF THAT. SO IN TERMS OF THE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DATA REPORTED SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME INDIVIDUAL CARRIES IT IT HAVE AN ACCURACY- BUT OBVIOUSLY IT PROVES BILLION TERMS OF LIKE DATA COLLECTION MOVING FORWARD FOR. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO SO YOU TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TRYING TO COLLECT THE DATA THE DAY TIGER DE DO YOU FEEL LIKE- WHERE WE WAS TRYING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY THAT THEY THAT WORK LIKE DATING SO YOU DO MENTION SOME OF THE THINGS AND GET. THE WORKING. THIS IS A AREA THAT I THINK WE A LOT OF FOCUS ON OFF OF THE DAY THAT WAS REAP INTO FIFTEEN WE COULD EVEN CREATE PORTRAY WE SEE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME HANDS ON THAT I WHAT KEY FACTORS THAT WE APPLY. VALIDATION THIS IS PART NEXT. VALIDATION VENDOR THE REVIEWS THAT THERE. WITH THE MATH AT ALL AND RE. THAT BUT THEY'VE SUBMITTED WE'VE ALSO PUT IN SOME. KIND OF- FILTERS ON OUR SUBMISSION PROCESS THAT WILL PICK UP SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE PLANTS CAN TRY TO SEARCH THEIR DATA TEST THAT TO SO THE NUMBER THINGS. ON THE RUN AND OUR TO. THE DAY THAT WE GET IT. IS CORRECT I THINK PROVIDER FOR. AND PROVIDE BURDEN CONTINUES TO A BIGOT. WE SEE MORE CONSOLIDATION IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT ARE DOING THESE CALLS FOR THE PLANS. THANK YOU WE'VE GOT DIRECTORIES TIMELY OX A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AND SO- I THINK WERE PROVIDED TO CAN BE CONFUSING THEY MAY THINK WELL I JUST ANSWER THE SURVEY BUT YOU MAY PRINT VENDOR A- CALL. OKAY THERE'S- REALLY. MAYES BANNERS IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT RYING TO CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THAT SO THAT INSTEAD OF WRITER BEING CALLED BY THREE DIFFERENT VENDORS STAY BY THE DATA AND NOW ALL THE ALL THE DEATHROW THEY'RE NOT DO YOU DO NOT SAID THAT- WELL WHOOSH I'LL SEE. IT'S NOT A FUNCTION THE DEPARTMENT WOULD TAKE ON WE HAVE ENCOURAGE THE INDUSTRY TO ABOUT A CONSOLIDATED APPROACH- THIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAD IN TWENTY. AS WE ARE THAT APPROACH THE- GIVE US AT THE- NEED THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. FOR THE DAY TO THE CO SEND AND COMES OUT IN THE MIDDLE DEPARTMENT AS THEIR DATA THAT IT'S ACCURATE- BUT I DO. AN AREA. BUT WE'VE ALL FLEXIBILITY TO DO THINGS LIKE SEND AN EMAIL- HAVE A PORTAL- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IS THE PRACTICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOT. LEVEL SOPHISTICATION BERRIES- BUT WE'VE ALLOWED SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT AT THAT ADVANCES IN THE TECH ADVANCES AND WE HAVE MORE DATA AVAILABLE THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED TO COMPLETE JUST MAKING PHONE CALLS. SO THIS IS REPORTED. DATE WE JUST FINISHED TWENTY NINETEEN. IS THE TWENTY THREE THINK THE DATA TWENTY NINETEEN IS BETTER DATA WE GOT TWENTY EIGHTEEN I HOPE SO MARCH THIRTY FIRST AS A SUBMISSION DEADLINE AS LONG AS IT'S ON A SUNDAY- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN YEARS IS INSIST GOT- WE MADE. BUT ALL DONE. THE PLAN HIGHLIGHTED WHERE THE THIS ARMS AGAIN I OUR HOPE AND EXPECT IS THE DATA WILL TO BETTER OKAY. AND THEN. SO YOU MENTIONED DOING RIG SON THE ACTUAL RATE OF COMPLIANCE- IF YOU PUT OUT ANY PRELIMINARY RATE OR SOMETHING I MEAN WHAT RATES ARE WE LOOKING AT. SURE TO DRAFT- AND THAT WE SHOULD- IS A RED COMPLAINTS A 70% FOR URGENT AN HONOR GENTE THAT IS NOT IS NOT. THE RIGHT IT'S COMING THE PERCENT OF THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN. OKAY ALL RIGHT AS IT 70% IS A HIGH. IT IS A MIA'S IS ABLE I MEAN I GUESS WE WE'VE MAY HAVE PEOPLE HERE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE BILL'S THAT WERE PASSED WHEN. PUSH THE EIGHT. I THINK THE WORST OF THAT STANDARD IS BEING SOMETHING ASPIRATIONAL I THINK THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW THAT AS A MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD AND NOW WE'RE SAYING. THE TIME YOU HAVE TO MEET THE MINIMUM FORM INSTEAD I REALIZE THIS. SPEC BY KILL THE TOP IS THE FIRST. 9% IN THE BOTTOM 67% AND SO RIGHT NOW THEORETICALLY AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE GRAPH I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SAID 70% IS ONLY THREE PLANS BELOW THAT- BUT USE DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT SAID OF ALL 70% OF TOP OF THE- THAT. AT QUITE THREE IT'S THAT'S A LOT THAT'S SO IN THE AT THE SAME TIME WE TURN AROUND AND I MEAN I I'VE BEEN ON THE FLOOR NAY SAID ALL WE HAVE TIMELY STANDARD SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NETWORK ADEQUACY. EXCEPT ME TO SET ASIDE. SO I'VE MET IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT TO ME I MEAN I APPRECIATE YOU SEE WITH ME AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE HAPPENING BUT IT. AND I GUESS I CAN ASK THE FOLKS TO SPOT WHO SPONSORED THE BILL THAT CENTER HERNANDEZ PASSIVELY THINKING THAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A STRETCH GOAL WHEN THEY PUT THOSE NUMBERS IN OUR THAT THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THEY WERE HOPING. WE NOW A LITTLE BIT ACOSTA NEXT I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS THE TIMELY ACCESS DINNERS. GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH PROJECT. WRITER SO EAGER TO REPEAT A TRUSTED AND THE YOU KNOW WORLD RENOWNED CARDIOLOGIST- IT'S- THAT WORK HAS TO HAVE THE COUPON. TO MEET FAMILY ACCESS RIGHT. ONE OF THE CRITICAL PIECES OF THIS THIS IS REALLY ABOUT STE STICKS MANY. AS WE TRYING. BASED THE REAL ALL APPROACH. TO PULL AMPLE OF THE NETWORK. TO PUT TO. THE TO THE ACT THE STATE. BOB SO OF THE CITY IS. BEST UP. WERE SOME SAMPLE TO DO ABILITY OF THE SAYS ONE. OF AN INTERESTED APPROACH IF YOU WERE TO REPEAT THAT IN THREE ATTEMPTS YOU WOULD MEET THE STANDARD SO AGAIN I THINK THERE'S THIS UNDERSTANDING FOR ITS THREE HUNDRED PER TO HAVE WRITERS AT. THE ONE FROM THE VACATION THERE IN PART TIME THE WHAT SAYS OF. AVAILABILITY ON THAT AT THE TIME TO MEET THE ARE STANDARDS SO FROM A STATISTICAL APPROACH APPROACH FOR IF YOU WERE TO MAKE KIND OF REAP. PROCESS BUT OR TO. STAND OF THE OTHER PIECE I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THE NUMBERS IS A CLEARLY HE SAID SO YOU'RE SAYING AS SEVENTY PERCENT- YOUR THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT. BASICALLY IF YOU MADE THREE ATTEMPTS YOU WOULD GET SOMEONE WITHIN THE- THREE TAPS SO YOU HAVE TO GO THIS PROVIDER CAN GET ME AND FIND THAT PROVIDER THAN WORK AND AFTER SECURE YET ME AT. BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE THIRD PROVIDER ASKED THE THIRD. AROUND AND BILL WILL YOU GET ME AND THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME THAT. PLEASE BASICALLY YOU ARE COUNTING ON A CHAIN OF THREE EFFORTS. TO GET YOU IN NO TIME FRAME OF THE OF THE OF. THE I GUESS OF THE STATE GREAT THE PRACTICE WHAT WE KNOW IS FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY CALL AND SAY I WANT TO MAKE IT A POINT WITH DOCTOR OWNS AND THEY WILL SAY WELL DOESN'T APPOINT. WEEKS FOR. SO WHAT. DO YOU TODAY CAN SEE YOU IN A WEEK. AND SO I THINK FROM THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE DEEPER AND- DOES IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THEY WOULD MAY BE ABLE TO CONNECT YOU WITH SOMEONE SO IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN THAT YOU. ARE MAKING THE DISH TIMES. THE OTHER SIDE JUST WANNA HIGH. TALK TO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN THE REPORT. SO WHAT'S IN THE REPORT IS CURRENTLY AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL AND AGAIN WE ARE MOVING TO A NETWORK LEVEL. AND AGAIN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS. AN INDIVIDUAL HONORABLY YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO STATE. THAT WERE OR- THE HMO THE P. NOT WORK AND SO WHERE WE WILL BE UP I IN THIS RATE OF A CUP. SO THAT THE WORK. OF LET US. IN ON. WHERE GAP ARE WHERE THE- SO I JUST WANT TO CAUTION A LITTLE BIT THAT WHILE 70% IS THE RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. IT'S A LITTLE. IN ORDER IS COMPARISON TO WHAT'S IN HERE AND SO I THINK WE MAY SEE MORE VARIATION WHEN WE APPLIED AT THE NETWORK LEVEL. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL- BUT THEY STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ESPECIALLY THE CHANCE THREE SO I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW HOW YOU COUNTING THIS LIKE. A I CALL PRACTICE OF NORMAL GROUPS. WELL THERE SPECIALTY INTERNET. THEY SAID WELL DOCTOR SO AND SO ISN'T IN BUTWE HAVE THIS OTHER DOCTOR WHO HAS AN APPOINTMENT.% AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU KNOW I GET THAT SOMEONE CAPTION NEVER CENTER AND SO WE GOT SOMEONE IN THAT'S CHAIN OF TO. DO GOING. MEANS PRACTICE WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS IN TIME NOW GO CALL SOMEONE ELSE. BECAUSE YEAH MAYBE THREE TWO I KEPT AS A CHAIN OF DO WELL THE PERSON BUT IS THERE BUT- HAVE SOMEONE ELSE. YEAH THEN OKAY YOU KNOW I DID GET MY PERSON BUT AT LEAST I'M GETTING TAKE CARE OF THE CHAIN OF THREE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE I MEAN THERE'S A BIG THERE'S A LITTLE BIT A THRESHOLD OF ANY LOOK AT FROM THE THIRD OF AND- IN BECAUSE- PLEASE THAT'S THE ONE CALL. ALL RIGHT. THE DOCUMENT. YOU CHANGING PROVIDER. THAT SECOND IS THE SECOND CALL OKAY NAGA FINE NOT JUST THAT PRACTICE I GOT FIND SOME OTHER PRACTICE. COULD NOT WHATEVER. THEIR PARENTS TENNESSEE. THAT'S NOW SO. THAT MY USUAL GROUP. WE HAVE A GROUPS HERE SO. I HATED. STILL LOW WARY ABOUT THE 70% IN THE RIGHT STANDARD BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL GET YOUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO MOVE TO SEE WHAT HOW THIS PLAYS OUT ALSO. HI. KATE I DON'T EVEN MENTION BY NO MEAN PROBABILITY SO AGAIN WE'RE TALKING A LOT OF A STATISTICAL APPROACHES WE- WE NEED A SOUND SUGGESTS A **** APPROACH TO BE ABLE TAKE ENFORCEMENT. AND I WOULD JUST READ. THIS IS ONE METRIC THEIR USED TO OBSESS AT ADEQUACY OF THE NETWORK WE HAVE OUR- ADEQUACY WE HAVE OUR- THE SAME PROCESS AGAIN. THE PERSON. THE THRESHOLD. WE WILL PLEASE FOR THE IS QUICK. ULTIMATELY IS TO HAVE A CAR ACTION PLAN TO CORRECT THE- IN THE NETWORK QUICKLY WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TWO YEARS FOR THE- RIVER. GET A WOULD A LOT. HOLD IT WHAT DO YOU AREAS AS SO WHICH NOW ARE AND SO AGAIN WE WILL HAVE A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS YOU KNOW TERRIBLE MAKING IN. I'M JUST. SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION WITH YOU OKAY SO WE ARE FIGURE OUT THAT HOW THIS THIS A PHYSICAL AND HELP TRAINS TO WHAT THE TRANSLATE INTO REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR. SEEKING TO GET IT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY RISEN INTO SO I GET THE STATISTICAL. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE- THAT THE- WALLS ON TIMELY ACCESS BEEN PASSED MANY MANY MANY YEARS AGO- SO IT'S NOT THIS IS SOMETHING IS BRAND NEW. I KNOW I KNOW. TALK AFTER YEAR WELL I THINK I THINK THERE IS A DESIRE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO THIS LAW AND YEAH YEAH I KNOW YOU WORKING TO DO THAT WITHOUT SOME DATA ISSUES THAT. ALSO I ALSO THINK NEED TO BE. IS THEN IN HOW WE PRESENT THEY ALSOHAVE THIS PEOPLE OF USE THIS LAW IN THIS AND THE STANDARD WHICH BY DOESN'T EXIST YET YOU'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THEY THAT THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE. A PROBLEM IS IN THE- AIR RIGHT AND SO WE ARE WE- AT THE- IT. NETWORK TRAFFIC. DO MORE ALREADY. AND I'M NOT SURE TO THAT'S TRUE. RIGHT AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE REALLY CLEAR WITH PEOPLE THAT HE SAID THIS IS NOT THE END ALL BE ALL- BUT ALSO IS. ASIANS AT THE ON THE CLAIM THAT YOU'VE- DOING SOMETHING I'M NOT SAYING AND A LOT OF WORK TO DO THIS. BUT DON'T WE- THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. DEAL WEAVE SO OFTEN THAT WE HAVE THE BACKSTOPS TO THE NETWORK ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUT OF NETWORK STATIONS SUPER. CALL AS MEDICAL BILLS WILL EARLY SURPRISE BECAUSE THERE'S FOR THE PATIENT. THE PLAN MAY NOT BE SO SURPRISING THEY DON'T HAVE THE CONTRACT RIGHT THE DOCTORS ARE HOSTILE MAY NOT BE SURPRISED HE NEVER GOT A CONTRACT ANOTHER OUT OF NETWORK OUT OF CONTRACT. FACILITY PROVIDER BUT- DE. NETWORK MAY NOT BEEN DESIGN A NO THAT'S PARTLY TRYING TO GET AT ME NOW BEEN THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT CAUSED THAT TO HAPPEN EIGHT AND SO YOU ALSO WE HAVE THE STANDARD SO AFTER WELL MAYBE NOT WE LOOK AT THAT SO RIGHT. OKAY PARTS OF THE- ON THE PRESCRIPTION APPRECIATE THAT NOW- YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE HAD THE TERMS OF THE- DRUG REBATES OF PRODUCTS AND ONE POINT ONE BILLION- SAYS HERE JUST SINCE ELEVEN POINT SEVEN THE NINE POINT ONE BILLION SO THAT SO IT'S A REAL DEBATE THAT THAT TIME IS A DRUG. TEST BECAUSE DEBATE. YOU FOR. SOMETHING RIGHT NOW Z. THE POCKETING IT ARE SPENDING ON SOMETHING ELSE SO SOME JUST READ RECONCILE IS IT NINE POINT ONE MINUS THE ONE POINT ONE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SPENDING ON DRUGS OR IS IT SHE WAS VERY NINE POINT BILLION ON DRUGS BECAUSE THE REBATE ITSELF. IT'S NOT I MEAN IT'S REBATES I MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT THE DRUGS COSTS THERE SPEND RATE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO SOMETHING ELSE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT INTERPRET THAT. RIGHT YEAH SO ACTUALLY HAD THE SAME QUESTION- BEFORE I CAME HERE AND SO. YES IT IS THAT IT WILL THE ONE MILLION WOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM THAT NINE. START THE NOT. TO KNOW NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION WOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM NOT. ONLY DO IT IN THAT WAY TOO THE IN THEM BECAUSE HE BATES ARE OUT. I AM. OVER YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME AND THERE AND MAYBE NOT OR IN THE- NEAR AS THE SO EIGHT EIGHT. TOLL. THAT WAY. YES YOUR RIGHT BE THOUGHT TO FROM THE TOTAL OF BUT BECAUSE THE COST THERE'S OUT WE DO KNOW IT THE YEAR THAT THEY'RE SPREAD WE REPORTED OUT THAT WAY OKAY SO I THINK I THINK WE HAVE A FULL THEN IN TURN- WE ALWAYS SAY BECAUSE THAT'S- THAT'S LIKE 10% RIGHT. ELEVEN POINT SEVENTY OLYMPIC 7% SO THAT MEANS THE ACTUAL SPEND THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ISN'T IS SHOULD BE ELEVEN POINT 7% LESS BECAUSE I MEANYEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IT'S COMING DIFFERENT YEAR ETCETERA BUT THE BUT THE SO THE NODES DATE THE GIVEN THE WAY WERE DESCRIBING IT WERE CUT OVER REPORTING THE PMR SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION. THE YES NUMBER SEVEN HE'S REBATE WHICH DOESN ACTUALLY GO TO PAY FOR DRUGS IS GOING FOR SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN WHETHER IT'S POCKET SOMEONE'S. BEING GREEN BAY SOME OTHER THING. IT'S NOT BEING SPENT SEVEN DID AT A REALIZE IT'S COMING OFF A DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S AT AROUND BUT I MEAN JUST AGAIN FOR. ACTORS IN TRANSPARENCY I THINK WE ARE. A REBATE IS NOT THE SPEND ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE ARE ON MEDICATION I ASSUME THIS PRESCRIPTION RIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT WE WILL TAKE THAT BACK FOR FUTURE REPORT OKAY YOU RIGHT YEAH SO. OKAY SO I MEAN THERE. AND THEN US SO ANYWAY WHAT WE WILL BE HEADING DELVING MORE INTO THIS SAID AT AT A POLICY HEARING SO IF THAT BY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT INSIGHTS THIS PROVIDES US. WERE LOOKING INTO. SING THAT. NOT FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING THAT. THAT OF THE TWENTY FIVE MOST RECENTLY PAID THE PRESCRIBED. DRUGS THEY ACTUALLY REPRESENT. THEM SO. WELL UNDER HALF 43% OF THE TOTAL SPEND SO. YEAH SO IT'S- BE INTERESTING BREAK THAT DOWN EXACT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ALSO NOTE THAT MOST OF THE SPEND DISCOURSES ON. A SPECIAL BRAG HOW ME THERE'S A SPECIAL IS THE GENERIC DRUGS WHICH ACTUALLY WERE MOST PEOPLE TAKE THE MEDICATION BUT THE FOR A FAIRLY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE ACTUAL. SO COSTELLO BUT MOSTLY IT IT'S NOT THE OVERALL SPEND ON FUTURE DOES THAT PATIENTS ARE LOOKING AT THE LOOK IN THEIR PARTICULAR MEDICATION SO- ALL RIGHT RANGE THINK OF THANK YOU RIGHT NOW THE COUNCIL'S MOVE ON TO THE PIN NUMBER TO INFORMATION RESOURCES ALRIGHT- SO OUR FIRST STATUS ADMINISTRATIVE MAY OUT AT EACH STATE AND ARE FOR STAB.

NO IT ALL PARTICULARLY DURING THESE YES SO GOOD AFTERNOON SHE AND MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR SONYA ANGEL DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND PUBLIC HEALTH SIR- IT'S CERTAINLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH MISSION IS TO EQUITABLY ADVANCE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE. COMMUNITIES AND WHEN WE SPEAK OF HEALTH IT'S NOT JUST THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE AN INJURED HEALTH IS ALSO AN OVERALL STATE OF PHYSICAL. MENTAL SOCIAL WELL BEING. AS SUCH THE ATTAINMENT OF THE POPULATIONS OPTIMAL HEALTH IS AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT ESTABLISHES A SOCIETY'S COULD PASS FOR SUCCESS. BUT BEFORE ENGINE TO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF OUR STATE LET ME FIRST ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR FRONT OF ALL OF OUR MINDS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR ACTIONS AT THE STATE HEALTH. DEPARTMENT NOVEL FROM ABOUT ALSO KNOWN AS- THE FORMULA ALONG WITH THE OTHER STATES IN THE NATION HAD IS NOW ENTERING A PERIOD OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION OF THE DISEASE. COMMUNITY AND MISSION OCCURS WHEN THERE ARE CASES CONFIRMED- OF COKE NINETEEN THAT ARE NOT TRACEABLE TO A TRAVEL HISTORY TO IMPACT IS FROM AN IMPACTED REGION AND IT'S NOT TRACEABLE TO KNOWN CASES. COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS NOT UNEXPECTED AND WE'VE BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS TO COME FOR SOMETIME. ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST FIRST CASE IN CALIFORNIA WAS IDENTIFIED IN ORANGE COUNTY. I IT IT WERE IDENTIFIED IN CASES WERE IDENTIFIED IN ORANGE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES THE FIRST COMMUNITY ACQUIRED CASE WAS IDENTIFIED ONE MONTH LATER FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD AND SOLANO COUNTY. CURRENTLY CALIPHS HAS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT CONFIRM TO CODE SEVENTY FOUR IS OUR- ON. XIN WELL HAD HOPES THE KELL COULD BE SPARED THERE HAS ALSO BEEN THREE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA FOR COVERT NINETEEN FOR DEATH EXCUSE ME JUST AS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOES NOT ALL AREAS COMMUNITIES ARE PEOPLE ARE FULLY AFFECTED STAY AND COUNTY. OKAY HE WAS ASSESSING THIS. AND WE'RE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITIES AS THE SITUATION CHANGES. WE'VE ACTIVATED THE MEDICAL HEALTH AND COORDINATION MEDICAL AND HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER AND THE STATE'S OPERATIONS CENTER IS ACTIVATED AT A LEVEL ONE. WE ARE BRINGING A WHOLE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THIS COORDINATING RESPONSE EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY TO SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT AS WELL AS THE- BY PROVIDING AT INFORMATION. GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. JUST TODAY WE'VE ANNOUNCED A GATHERING SHOULD BE POSTPONED OR CANCELED ACROSS THE STATE FOR AT LEAST THE REMAINDER OF THE MONTH TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SLOW THE RATE OF TRANSMISSION OF COVERED NINETEEN NINETEEN. AND THEIR SPECIFICS ON THE TYPES OF GATHERING SO SHOULD BE CLOSED. BASED ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE PRO OF THE SEVEN MAKE IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE IMPLEMENT SOCIAL THING THIS TO. A IS SEVEN POURTANT. PENSION TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. I'D NOW LIKE TO GO INTO SPEAKING MORE GENERALLY ABOUT THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH- OVER THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION HAS CONTRIBUTED REDUCING BY MORE THAN HALF THE RATE OF THAT'S ALL GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA LIFE EXPECTANCY IS NOW AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IT IS EVER BEEN SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE YEARS FROM THEN. FOUR POINT FOUR FOR WOMEN COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WERE ONCE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH BUT CHRONIC CONDITIONS ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR NINE IN TEN DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA OVER ALL CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES ARE ALSO THE LEADING CAUSES OF BENDABLE DESK DEBT BEFORE AGE SIXTY FIVE. BOTH RATES OF MERRY HEART DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER HAS DECLINED STEADILY AND SUBSTANTIALLY OVERLAP A RECENT DECADES BUT GOOD HEALTH IS A BIG IN FOR OUR- CONTINUE TAKES. THIS HIGH EARLY DEATH DUE TO CAN. MANY DISPARITIES IN INEQUITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES EXISTING CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE HEALTH CONDITIONS OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY IN EARLIER AND WITH GREATER SEVERITY AMONG POPULATIONS OF COLOR AND THOSE EXPERIENCING LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. BLACKS ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE EARLY FROM CORONARY HEART DISEASE THAN WHITES. OTHER STRIKING EXAMPLE SEEN WHAT HEARING HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG BLACK AND WHITE. IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE AGE ADJUSTED ALL BECAUSE DEATH DEATH RATE IN THIRTY IS WHITES. THESE DIFFERENCES BECOME EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED YOUNGEST AGE GROUPS. DEATH RATES FOR CHILDREN AGES FIVE TO FOUR OR TO TIMES I AMONG AND FOR CHILDREN AGE ZERO FOR THEIR TWO POINT SIX TIMES HIGHER. ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES SUCH AS THESE IS NOT ONLY CENTRAL TO IMPROVING POPULATION. IT'S A SENSUAL. WHAT IT TELLS ME IS UNIQUE AND CORE FUNCTIONS AS POPULATION SURVEILLANCE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH USES OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND DATA ANALYSIS. LABORATORY TESTING AND SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR ISSUES THAT AFFECT HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS ARE IDENTIFYING ARE EXPERTS AT IDENTIFYING ROOT CAUSES AND UNDERSTANDING INTERSECTIONS ACROSS ISSUES WERE INFORMED BY DATA COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE EVIDENCE AND EVALUATION MOST IMPORTANTLY PUBLIC HEALTH IS AT ITS TO SELL UP AND FIRST. TO STRATEGIES. KING WHAT ARE MANY THERE ISN'T HELP PART TO ACT AND IMPROVE THE OF ALL. HOW THE PRODUCT ONCE Q. X. WHEN IMPORTANT INTERSECTION IS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THE END IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LIVING LONGER IT'S ABOUT LIVING WELL. THROUGH SURVEILLANCE AND MAPPING WE CAN BE THE SOCIO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMUNITY ASSETS INFLUENCE HEALTH AND THAT HEALTH OUTCOMES OF VERY BY GEOGRAPHY. AS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THAT WHEN I TELL MY PAY WHEN I TELL MY PATIENTS TO EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH GROCERY STORES CLOSE BY OR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAY BE EXPENSIVE. FOR THOSE ON A LIMITED BUDGET CAN THE CHOICE EAT MORE THAN. MIGHT IN CHOOSING NOT TO BUY MEDICATIONS. BUT HOW IT IS TO MAKEHEALTHY CHOICES. BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES IF. OF HEALTHY CHOICES HEALTH IS ORPHALI SHAPED BY OUR COMMUNITIES CONDITIONS. TEAMING UP PUBLIC IN MEDICAL SYSTEM RESOURCES CAN BE A SYNERGISTIC WAITED MAKE OUR ASSETS GO FURTHER THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGIES CAN EXTEND THESE BENEFITS BROADLY ACROSS ELATION. IN CALIFORNIA DECREASES IN PART DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER AS WELL AS OTHER NOTEWORTHY TO REDUCTIONS IN IN CONDITIONS SUCH AS CHRONIC OF. PULMONARY DISEASE HEPATITIS C. HEPATITIS B. AND H. I. V. HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY PUBLIC HEALTH THINK NICKEL STEMS WORKING TOGETHER. KNOWN AS THE CROSS THE LIFESPAN VERY DEATHS UNDER PERSONS ARE DOMINATED BY HIGHLY BY PREVENTABLE IN THE RELATED CONDITIONSSUCH AS DRUG ASSOCIATED DEATHS ROAD INJURIES SUICIDE AND ASIDE. DOZEN AGING POPULATIONS ARE DOMINATED BY CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CANCER THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT HEALTHY AGING NOW AND EVERYONE BUT OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE HEALTHY AGING EVERYONE IS TO START WHEN PETE ARE YOUNG. IMPACT OF CHILD AND COMMUNITY ADVERSITY TOXIC STRESS AND CUMULATIVE TRAUMA IS A ROOT CAUSE OF SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA. ADVERSE COULD EXPERIENCE OTHERWISE ACES CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES THROUGH ALTERED AND ALL PEOPLE MORE PHONE TO AND- HERE'S THE CAN FOR HELP OUT. EXT THREE FIVE. HERE DAHLE REPORTED A ONE OR MORE IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH PARTNER WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF DR NADINE KERIS CALIFORNIA'S FOR SURGEON GENERAL IN ADDRESSING EARLY CHILDHOOD WELL BEING AS A KEEPRITE RT. PUBLIC HEALTH SUPPORT BY WORKING DRAFT PREVENT COMMUNITY TRAUMA AND FOSTER RESILIENCE TO STRENGTHEN THE HELP THE COMMUNITIES AND TO PREVENT ACES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE CONSIDER THE LANDSCAPE ISSUES FACING PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN CORE PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY THIS INCLUDES CONTINUING WORK TO ADDRESS LEADING RISK FACTORS FOR PREVENTABLE DEATH LIKE TOBACCO AND HYPERTENSION. STOPPING VAPING IN USE AND REINFORCING INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL THROUGH VACCINATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WE KNOW THESE ARE WINNABLE. WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN OUR IN IS TO MOBILIZE AND RESPOND TO POP UP EMERGING HE'S AROUND. TO BUYERS SEVERAL KEY CHALLENGES THAT KEY ISSUES CHALLENGING CALIFORNIA WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH CANNOT STAND ASIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MUCH TO LOSE BY DOING SO AND SO MUCH TO GAIN BY LEANING IN. THIS INCLUDES ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUPPORT IN THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY ON MET HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH IT'S HOMELESSNESS. STOPS USE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED I LOOK FORWARD TO JOIN YOU IN THE FUTURE TO DISCUSS TODAY DETAILS OF THESE THE IMPLANTS. FOR ALL OF THESE AREAS AND MORE BE EXPLORING WAYS TO. OUR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEAVING ANYONE BEHIND. BECAUSE IT WHILE WHAT WE MEASURE MATTERS WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE ALSO MATTERS THERE ARE KEY POPULATIONS WHICH OUR CURRENT STANDARD POPULATION SURVEYS AND DATA SYSTEMS DOT CAPTOR WELL. SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING KEY QUESTIONS BUT SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE SERVICE AND DATA TOOLS THEMSELVES ARE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT WERE. ADDRESSED ENGAGE OUR RELATIONS TO FULLY. UNDER IN THE RURAL. LGBT PERSONS JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE JUST A FEW KEY EXAMPLES WELL WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS IMPROVING OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO REFLECT ALL POP. IS A PRIORITY WITHOUT THAT UNDERSTANDING THE DESIGN AND REFINEMENT OF OUR INTERVENTIONS TO MAXIMIZE IMPACT CANNOT BE FULLY REALIZED. THEY HAVE PROVIDED A BROAD OVERVIEW OF WHAT OUR DATA IS TELLING US WE'RE LIVING LONGER AND MAKING GREAT PROGRESS STILL UNACCEPTABLE AND ON JUST INEQUITIES EXIST FOR MOST OF THE CAUSES OF POOR HEALTH AND EARLY DEATH WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. A SOLUTIONS EXIST OUR EXPERTISE IN SURVEILLANCE GIVES US THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE POPULATIONS UNDERSTAND WHICH POPULATIONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE MEASURE. IN IMPLEMENTING XIN I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE. REST OF WHICH WILL BE ON FUN. SOME OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE STATE'S HEALTH. I'LL CLOSE BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WHILE WE COMBINE DATA AND DESCRIBE DISEASE ND HEALTH IN AGGREGATE. EVERY DATA POINT REPRESENTS A PERSON. A MOTHER A FATHER A CHILD OR A NEIGHBOR AND MAYBE EVEN ONE OF YOU. ARE CHARGING PUBLIC TO LIFT UP THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THE TOTALITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

NURSES DOCTORS HOSPITALS DEEPLY DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THIS IT'S DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF ON GOING CONVERSATION COMMUNICATION AND- BY MINUTE HOUR BY OUR DAY TO DAY JUST TWO THINGS. IF WE REALLY NEED NOW THE FIRST IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO BE MADE BY THE STATE AND WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT HEY. AND WE NEED TO CHANGE. CHANGE WE'VE GOT TO WORK EVEN QUICKLY. EVERYONE IS FLAT OUT- BUT WE THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT IF WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY- THIS FOR. WELCOME THE HELP SYSTEM- QUICKLY. AND GOAL AND THAT IS IN PATIENTS AND WORK IF. POURTANT CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED MOST RECENTLY OF THE FIRST QUARTER HELLO. THERE IS NOT BE ACQUIRED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AS A DANGER FOR HOW WE ADDRESS BECAUSE WE NEED TO. VERY AND HE CHALLENGE VERY CLOSE. FOR A CONTAINMENT STRATEGY. REALLY TO STOP THIS THE VIRUS MEDICATIONS AND THAT IS TO LIMIT IMPACT OF THE VICE AND ARE. BECAUSE WE HAVE FEDERAL. BIDEN SAID OKAY. GOT IN. ON TOP OF THAT. DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE NOW FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO MOVE FROM AIRBORNE TWO DROPLETS PRECAUTIONS I CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS WE'VE GOT A FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW THE FACT. CENTERS THESE CONTROL OF IT'S CLEAR. TO BE IN THEIR GUIDANCE WE SHOULD I BE FALL XING TEN STATE IN THEIR MOVE TO ADOPT HEALTH ORGANIZATION GUIDANCE ON THIS MATTER IT WILL ALLOW US TO ALLOCATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN THAT. OCCURS FOR AT RISK AND WITH IT WE WILL. LICENSE STRETCH ARE LIMITED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SECOND HE TO ALLOW HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE COVE IT VIRUS ARE CALLED THE POSITIVE PATIENT WHO ARE NOT SICK. CAN YOU WORK THIS CRITICALLY IN. A ONE ORGANIZATION AS YOU KNOW HAS HAD TO FURLOUGH HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR WORKERS FOR ONE PATIENT GOOD NEWS IS THEY'RE ALL BACK HEALTHY. HAVE FOR ALLOWING BETWEEN IN A HUNDRED WORKERS ARE PAID. WE'VE GOT A CHANGE THAT OR WE WILL HAVE THE HEALTH CARE. WE NEED ONLY TO THE CODE BY. THE CAP. IN HOSPITAL IS THAT SOME NEED ON IMMEDIATELY THIRD WE NEED TO SHIFT LEAVE EIGHT ROB RATHER THAN A COUNTY BY COUNTY STRATEGY THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB I'LL BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT WE HAVE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S ALL TO. WE FRIENDS OF ROUTE WE- DO UNIFIED THAT. FINALLY TIME TO INTO THE STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE WE ARE ON THE EDGE OF A AVAILABILITY OF WHAT WE NEED AND WHILE MOST PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED RIGHT NOW ON MAC THAT IS REAL. THEY SHE ARE WE ARE REALLY REAL WAY AT THE END EIGHT ASKING ORGANIZATIONS AND ARE CARE WORKERS AND THEIR SAFETY TO LIVE ON THE EDGE IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW SO- THAT'S THE IMPORTANT CHANGE. SHOULD WORK MORE QUICK. UPWARD AS I MENTIONED WE WILL OVER WELL THE- SO WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION IN A FEW MINUTES THANK YOU. REGULAR SPENDER. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE ROLE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE PLAYING IT IS IMPORTANT RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. JACKIE BEEN. ON INSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS REPRESENTING THE TWENTY ONE COUNTY AFFILIATED SYSTEMS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS WE ARE LOCATED IN FIFTEEN COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE REPRESENTING OUR EIGHTY PER. ST LUCIAN AND WHICH TO ALL WHO NEED. AVERAGE ROUGHLY HALF OF OUR PATIENTS EITHER HAVE MEDI CAL OR HAVE NO INSURANCE. WE ALSO OPERATE SEVERAL OF PUBLIC RESOURCES WE ARE OVER HALF OF THE LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTERS AND BURN CENTERS IN THE STATE AND WE TRADE OVER HALF OF THE NEW DOCTORS IN THE STATE. BOB BY THE SPECIAL. CHERRY CARE BUILDING HI SPECIALIZED CAPACITOR TREAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE. SO BOLD AS PUBLIC ENTITIES AND AS HOSPITALS I WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND- TOUCH ON THREE KEY UNIQUELY PUBLIC ROLES THAT WE PLAY- AND OUR MEMBERS ARE PLAYING AND RESPOND TO THE VIRUS SO FIRST. I WE REALLY ARE ON THE LINE THIS CALL IN WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND WE OF THE VERY FIRST HOSPITALS TO RECEIVE PATIENTS EITHER THROUGH AIRPORT REFER. THREE FLIGHTS. COULD SUPPORTING SLIDE THAT LANDED IN RIVER. I WE RECEIVE SOME OF THE CASE BECAUSE OF OUR CAPACITY TO TREAT HIGH RISK INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND BECAUSE OF OUR LONG HISTORY OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS- WE WORK WITH AND WERE SOMETIMES. INTO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. SECOND A MANY PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF INNOVATION AND WE'RE HOPING STATE RAPIDLY EXPAND CAPACITY FOR TESTING- AND PREPARING FOR THE SHARP UP TAKE A POTENTIAL WE'RE EXPECTING A CASES. HE ALSO- IT WORKING RUN DIAGNOSTICS IN HOUSE. AND THIS MEANS THAT THERE WOULD THEY WILL BE ABLE OR ARE ALREADY PROCESSING TEST IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. AND THAT THEY ARE ALSO IN FREE UP CAPACITY ANOTHER LAPSE UCSF UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO ARE ALREADY ON LINE AND WE EXPECT UC DAVIS AND UC IRVINE. RUNNING THE THERE'S ALSO A THE SITE WHERE ONCE OF THE OF WORDS WERE READY TO A VACCINE AND CLINICAL TRIALS THAT THOSE COULD BE THE SITES TO RUN SOME OF THOSE CLINICAL TRIAL TESTS. AND LASTLY WE ARE CORPS PROVIDERS OF SOME. OF CARE TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OUR MEMBERS ARE REACHING OUT TO LISTEN CANNONS- THEY'RE EDUCATING ABOUT APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS HAND WASHING- TRYING TO IDENTIFY NICELY INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS. TO ILLUSTRATE HOW ALL IS MY TIE TOGETHER JUST AN EXAMPLE IN ONE COUNTY OF HOW THE STRUCTURE WORKS- THE COUNTY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ITSELF IS SERVING AS THE FIRST PLACE OF TREATMENT FOR ANYONE WHO'S IDENTIFIED- AND IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR CAR BUYERS SYMPTOMS. AND THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY THEIR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH LABS FOR TESTING. THAT SAME SYSTEM THERE ARE STAFF- BEGAN QUICKLY WORKING WITH THE MEDICAL- HEALTH JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER. SO ORGANIZING ALL OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WITHIN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND THAT'S ACTIVATED WHEN THERE'S A BE A NEED FOR INCREASED STAFFING AND RESPONSE AND THEN THEY ARE ALSO WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO DO A REACHED HOME A POPULAR ONES. AND ALL OF THIS IS REALLY JUST WROTE OUR LONG HISTORY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC WELLNESS AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST LESSONS WE CAN WAY THUS FAR IS THAT. I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT USE THIS BUTTON FOR SALE BOB NAME IS JASON BELL TO I AM NOW AMY BLOOMBERG THAT LED. TO OF THE CALIFORNIA. OF HOUSE FACILITY. I AM THE TO OF RUMORED. LESSEN RISK FOR. A CALF. ARE WE READY ABOUT TWELVE FIFTY LONG TERM FOR. AND SCHOOL SKILLED FOR. OR MEDIA CARE FOR STILL FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND PEDIATRICS ACUTE FACILITIES. WE CARRY. LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND PAY. IT SUCCEEDED POINT TWO BILLION. I JUST WANTED TO A STEP. TO YOUR FROM BRITAIN FIVE RESPONSE ECHO WE FULLY SO. THE HOSPITAL SO SUGGEST AS IT RELATES TO AND HAVING A STATEWIDE. SEPT MESSAGE WE TO HAVE MULTIPLE RIVER PROVIDER WITH. FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE DIFFERENT INDICATIONS EVEN FROM COME THE HAVE THE SAME RATE. AND SO IT MAKES CONFUSE FOR THEM UNDER WHICH ONE THE MOST. WE HAVE WORKED FANTASTICALLY WITH PUBLIC CAL AS WELL AS HEALTH AND HE SERVICES THE BEEN EXTRA RICH OF THE SET UP FOR CALL THAT WE- ON A DAY BASIS. I'M A WILL CONTINUE TO DO UNTIL THE CRISIS OVER WITH SEC CALF IN RESPONSE THIS IS CREATED A WEB WHERE WE COLLATE THE MOST PER PARTNER INFORMATION SO. WE REVIEW THEM FOR FROM TWENTY PUBLIC PARCHMENTS IN TRY TO KEEP PRESENT I CAN TO OUR MEMBERS WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. THAT WE ARE THE MOST BUT APPROACH WE DO. WE. THE PUBLIC PARMENTER CAL'S ADOPTION IS THIS REQUIRE FOR. OUR VISIT OR A HOME WITH JUST SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE THAT WOULD BE OUR SUGGEST. AS WE AT. HOW WE ARE PRETTY THE FOLKS IN A BUILDING THESE SOME THE THINGS THAT WERE ASK FOLKS TO DO I. WANT TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE FROM C. WHERE WE DIFFER WERE. FOLKS GREEN STAFF. OF FIRST SENTENCE SHIP AND WERE REQUIRING. WERE SICK STAY THAT WAS LESS. A LITTLE UNCLEAR IN THE C. GUIDE ONE OF THE THINGS IN THIS GOT THAT WE ALSO NOT CLEAR. WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT AND HELLO. INTER SO SHOULD WE BE LOW. INTERNALWHAT IN THE BUILDING THAT. OUR SUGGESTION IS WE SHOULD CUT OUT AS- WE ARE WE'VE LEARNED THAT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO BRING A STATE RIGHT WRIST FOR THESE FOLKS BECAUSE OUT DEVELOPS PLAN FOM ONE. OFFICE TO ANOTHER DâN CAN I MY THIS STAFF BEEN A TO COPE AND CAN I SEND THEM TO AND BUILDING THIS AREA. IN THIS CASE. SAN UPS. AS IT RELATES STAFFING AND MAKES YOU DO. FOR US TO ACCOUNT THAT IN ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THIS IS HIGH. IS NOT JUST SKILLED NURSING BUT MOST OF KERR'S JUST IN TIME ORDER NO PP. HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO RESPOND THIS THE MESSAGE THAT ARE MEMBERS ARE. IS THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE A CO FLU OUTBREAK YOU WON'T GET. A YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU. UNLESS THAT CHANGES. WE'VE GOT FOLKS AT RISK IN OUR BUILDING. THE OTHER THING IS WHAT DO WE DO. IN TWO WEEKS WHEN THIS EXPERIENCE- OR ANIMAL WHEN THIS EXPERIENCE ARE WE LOOKING AT YOU. SPACE AND SKILLED. FACILITIES TO TAKE. UP POSSIBLY. A POSSIBLE PATIENTS THAT. NON THE MATTER MORE BUT STILL SHOW. ALL STATIONS WITH A HEALTH ABOUT THE ONLY WOULD WOULD I WANT TO BE THE LAST RESORT WE WALK. TO THINK A AN ALTERNATE CARE SITES WERE SOME AT THE- THAN RATHER THAN PUTTING HIM IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WOULD CAUSE THE MOST HARM AND SO WE KNOW. THE MORTALITY RATE IN THE CITY'S HIM. ARE AT IN WASHINGTON WAS BOB OF A NINETY IT'S PAST WAIT THAT TEST POSITIVE SO THAT'S NOT A OUR FOR THE FOLKS IN SKILLED NURSING THESE ARE FOLKS OVER EIGHTY YEARS OLD A MULTI HOW CAN SECOND TO A OUTCOME SO. ARE OUR SUGGESTION ARE AT AS WE GO FOR JUST. IF DO I COME UP HERE. SO WE HEARD A LIST OF DIFFERENT THINGS- SO WE CAN COMMENT ON A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING- SO MESSAGE ON TESTING PRIORITIES WE ARE RIGHT NOW WITH A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS HELD. UP WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR MORE LABORATORY TESTING AND SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COST LABS TAKE OUR BACKLOG FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. NOW I HAVE A BACKLOG BUT MORE OF DEMANDING TESTING WE WOULD MEAN- ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL TESTING NEEDS WE ARE LOOKING AT. I'M ALTERNATE CARE SITES AND EXPANSION OF HOSPITAL CAPACITY. OF CALF. ELOQUENTLY STATED WE DO NOT WANT TO PUT THESE PEOPLE ANYBODY WHO COULDN'T BE IN A HOSPITAL INTO HELP CARE FOR THE THANK. AT THIS RISK FOR OR DOES IT IS. FOR THE REST WE ARE. I CALL FOR AND WE DO THAT AS NEED ME ARE PREPARING THE SCRIPT WE ARE LOOK AT THE CAPACITY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO GO STATE WILL. NOT HAVE NOT BUT AGAIN SYSTEM I. SERVER THE NEED TO MOVE CONTAIN TO MEDICAID AND I THINK THAT GUIDANCE WE DID LAST NIGHT ON MASS GATHERING AS A FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND WILL. BE PUT. ON OUR WEBSITE. HE IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE YOU GOT PERMISSION TO USE EXPIRED AND NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS THAT'S TWENTY ONE MILLION- WE'RE SENDING THOSE OUT WE- NINETY RESOURCE REQUESTS AND WE FILLED THE FIRST FIFTY FIVE OR- THE- WILLING. TO VOTE SEVEN CARE TO CONTINUING TO. BE OUR WE HAVE CRAFT ARE REQUEST FOR THE STREET NATIONAL STOCKPILE. ABOUT A MONTH. COUPLE DAYS. TODAY BUT THERE ARE THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE WAY HELLO I'M TO DROP A PRECAUTION WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT CERTAINLY MORE AWAY REQUIRING NEVER NEGATIVE PRESS ICE COMES EVERYTHING BUT I'M NOT AIR HOUSING. THERE'S GOING CARE WERE I KNOW WASHING HAS MOVED AWAY. LOOKING UP AS WELL TO TAKE PEOPLE OFF OF CORN AND DO BOTH A SYMPTOM TAX IN FAVOR TAX OKAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN PUT THAT IN PLACE. SEE SEE ME ABOUT WHAT. YOU'RE FOR TO MOVE THAT WAY. TIONS SIXTEEN TO STATEWIDE STRATEGIES- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S IN THE SAME PLACE IN A STATE WHERE SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND IT SAYS MAYBE A COLLECTION OF NOT TESTING BUT WE KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE YOU ON CAN'T. TOWARDS ALLOW THE ALLOW LOCAL FLAG. UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO STATEWIDE APPROACH A MORE THE MORE WE CAN MOVE THAT DIRECT. I'M POLITICS. WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR PAN THAT FOR A LONG TIME WE KNOW THAT IF THIS COP REALLY BAD WE WOULD NEED SOMETHING EYOND WHAT WE CAN DO IN OUR OUR SYSTEM AND SO BEEN PLANNING FOR- DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE APPLE BUT PLANNING FOR THE WORST BUT- WE WILL CONTINUE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH HARPER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS RIDER ASSOCIATION. BECAUSE THOSE ORDINARY NOW TO KEEP PLANNING THINGS THAT. WE ARE. PLAY COMES FROM. FINANCE YES PLEASE. SENATE PARTICULARLY- M. WE DID HAVE ONE QUESTION- IS WHETHER THE EMERGENCY FUNDING AT THE STATE LEVEL- WHAT HOW THAT BEING. THE TWENTY THE TWENTY MILLION YEAH THAT'S ACTUALLY THE UP THERE'S A TWENTY MILLION REQUESTED WASN'T VERY MUCH SPECIFICITY ABOUT WHAT THE- WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING USED FOR. DON'T QUESTION THE- FACT MAYBE MORE LATER WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THAT AND I THINK PART OF IT IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THEM LOOKING WHERE THE CAPS ARE. THEY HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS UP SO. THE SITUATION WITH THE TESTING RIGHT- ON THE ALSO SURVEYS THAT WE DO HERE A LITTLE BIT MIXED MESSAGES IN TERMS AVAILABILITY OF TESTS RIGHT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT CC SENDS OUT THESE KIDS BUT THE KIDS ARE VERY. I SAY NOT COMPLETE THEY DON'T ALLOW OU TO DO THE ENTIRE TEST THAT THE KIDS COME TEN CERTAIN COMPONENTS IN THIS RESEARCH THE LAB RESULTS FINALLY THE OTHER COMPONENTS AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER COMPONENTS MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THAT LAB OR SOMETHING SO. THAT'S AND HITTING. AND THEN THERE'S I HEARD SOMETHING IS ALONG THE LINES OF WELL WE CAN'T DO THE TEST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PERMISSION EXIT OFF BEAT CERTAIN CRITERIA. OF THE PRESIDENT'S SAYING ANYBODY WHO WANTS ORDER A TEST TO THE DOCTOR ONCE OR TESTICULAR TEST. AND THEN WE ARE LIKE- WELL THERE'S NO QUOTE THERE'S NO BACKLOG BUT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE SO WE'LL JUST HEAR MY OWN DISTRICT. WE HAVE A SYSTEM FACILITY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WE HAVE ONE WOMAN WHO PASSED AWAY AND I'M IN PASSED AWAY. AND TO LIKE WELL HOW THE PEOPLE YOU TESTING THEY'RE GOING AND SO. THERE ISN'T A BACKLOG BUT YET WE'RE NOT TESTING PEOPLE AND PEOPLE THEY WERE SHOULD TO. AND IT'S THE- A BACK. HAVE ENOUGH SO THERE FOR THEY DON'T. ORDER THEM. SO THERE'S A LOT OF. AROUND TEST AVAIL. IS THAT CENTER- I THINK MOST PEOPLE. ANY TELL ME ONE WRONG MOST PEOPLE SAYING WELL WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEST PERIOD. THAT PROVIDE A PROBLEM BUT IS THAT ALSO THEREFORE CAUSING PEOPLE TO BEHAVE IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT. IT IS REFLECTING THE REAL DEMAND THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING FOR TESTING. WHAT THE HELL YOU THINK ABOUT SOUTH. IN TERMS OF BEILINSON SO. COUNTRIES THERE TURN THE CURVE. EIGHT COMPARED TO SO WE STE WE'RE FLYING BLIND BECAUSE THE NUMBER TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS THAT WERE A BIT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TRY DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON OUT THERE IS THE MY RATE. NO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE SURVEILLANCE TESTING I THINK IN TERMS OF TREATMENT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT MUCH WE ARE PREPARED TO GET TOUGH. CLOUT I'M JUST CAME ONLINE THIS WEEK AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CA BOBCORE AND THEIR RAMPING UP THEIR CAPACITY I THINK WE STILL WANT TO WEAR TIES. BE TESTED AND THEN MOVED TO THE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUT THERE. BECAUSE WE DON'T. IN WEEK WHAT YOU TELL WHEN YOU TEST MORE YOU WILL FIND MORE. SO FOR EXAMPLE I'M- BECAUSE I CERTAINLY KNOW MY OWN I'D SAY OKAY. SAYS THE ONLY DO THE TEST TODAY. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. DO YOU HAVE. TO DO MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT IS A BECAUSE THE TYPE OF TASK BUT ON A HEALTH LAB IS MY MORE ME STAFF AND SEVEN VERY DE THAN A LAB DO RIGHT I HEARD IT'S THAT OBVIOUSLY TO TERM LIMITS STAFFING WISE BUT- BUT HERE'S- I HEARD. TO DO WITH. BUT THE COMPONENTS THE OUT OF WILL ALSO THE ARE THEY HAVE TO THE KIDS ON THE LOUNGE DO CERTAIN THE WRITERS SAYING AS OF WEEK THEY HAVE CAPACITY TO RUN MORE TESTS AND BUT THEY RIGHT THERE WERE MISSED SOME OF THE PIECES LAST WEEK. RIGHT AND SO ARE WE HELPING FOR SO IT'S UP TO THE FLOORS ARE READ LIVE STEP HE DID FROM LABS BUT THAT. WHAT DO YOU NEED AND WHY ARE WE LIKE BREAKING THROUGH ON ON THAT DAY A SIR FEEL LIKE. PEOPLE WELL WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OR WE DON'T HAVE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OR SOMETHING THAT WHERE WE TRULY DOWN AND GETTING PAST THAT ARE WE ARE JUST READ THIS WEEK OF ALL OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. TO FIND OUT. THIS IS MISSING WHAT. I'M MANY OF THEM HAVE DONE COMMON AND SO NOT A OF THEY'VE BEEN BACK YOU KNOW LIKE THEY THEY AND MANY OF MARK TO HAVE JUST BEEN TESTING FOR THE WEAKER THERE SPEED ADDING OTHER REACHED EVER. ABLE TO TEST AND BROUGHT NUMBER. THAT WE THINK. BE HELPFUL. OKAY A AT. GET A- SELECT IS AS THEY'RE ABLE TO DO AND AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THE PRIVATE LABS YOU KNOW YOU SEE DEVELOP THE WAY AND OTHER WHAT THE LOW RATE A STEP FOR SEE B. ON THE RUN THE TEST. IT INTERESTING THAT THREE SEIZE RIGHT WE DO THEIR RAM UP AT WAITING FOR APPROVALS WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP LIKE LIKE DO IT TODAY I MEAN IT DOES WE CAN DO IT WHY CAN'T. YOU DO IT WHY IS IT LIKE THANK YOU FOR DAYS FOR THE THAT. IT'S GOING. I CAN SPEAK TO ONE OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC OKAY WE IS EQUIPMENT VERY QUICK IS OUT DAY WE HAVEN'T KEEPING AN UP THERE IS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PIECE OF A THAT CAN EAT THE DOUBLE FAULT THE AMOUNT OF TESTING YOU PER DAY CALLED IN ROBOT NINE US SEVEN TWO IF WE FOUND THE FINE WE BY THEM AND YOU CAN BUY THEM BECAUSE THERE NOW YOU. RIGHT BUT WOULD BE EXACTLY RIGHT AS A PREPARATION OKAY. AND I ADD ANOTHER LIMITING TO THAT WE HAVE. YEAH FOCUS THE TECH. IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE SPACE. RIGHT YOU WERE FULL. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE TEST KITS THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF WE HAVE LIMITED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SO WE'RE ALREADY SHORT WE NEED TO MOVE TO DROP WHAT PRODUCTION SO WE CAN USE THAT AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT THAT WILL. QUICKLY BECOME A RATE LIMITING FACTOR CONCERNED. DOES THE TESTING THE RESULT WILL END UP BACK IN HOSPITALS AND WE WILL AGAIN BE- BACKLOGGED AS A RESULT. OKAY SO I KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAP INTO THESE VARIOUS RESERVES FOR HE QUIT AND THREE NO I MEAN IS THERE SUFFICIENT IN THE RISEN IN THOSE RESERVES THAT IT IS HAVE A BROADER QUESTION AND SOME OF THE INTERNET RESERVES ARE. WE FINDING WAYS. PLEASE REALIZE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IS ALSO BEEN DISRUPTED. OUR THAT WE ARE FILLING SO FAR WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILL A RESOURCE FOR THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AND WE'RE FEELING THE REST OF THEM AND WE WILL MAKE A STRATEGIC NATIONAL. REQUEST ON THIS ALSO APPLIES. HEY REALIZES TRIED NOT SO MUCH THE QUESTION. ALTHOUGH PRETTY BIG STAY I MEAN A- IT IS THE- IS THE- SUPPLY CHAIN FOR PRODUCING EVEN MORE I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING LIKE EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY'S GONNA BE THE MAN THE THESE. CINDER BY TEN THE PARCEL OF THEM OUT WHERE'S THE FIRST ADDITIONAL ONES GONNA COME FOR. PART OF THE CHALLENGES ME THESE THINGS ARE. IN CHINA AND SPOTS BEEN A RATE LIMITING STEP IN TERMS OF THE FIVE THEIR SUPPLIES. OKAY SO YES SO WHAT ARE YOU ONE OF THE FOR FUTURE IS TO LOOK AT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FOR. RATE I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THINGS WILL CALM THE NEXT ONE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING. WILL I KNOW COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT- MADE THE CITY HAD A- I REALIZE. IN OUR EFFORT. BE MORE EFFICIENT THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE RIGHT JUST IN TIME I MEAN THAT I GOT IT I STUDIED ALL THAT STUFF AS WELL AND YOU KNOW AND SO FORTH BUT SO IN IN SPECIALLY FOR THINGS ARE NEEDED A CRISIS IT AS SOON AS YOU LIKE RELEASING MONEY BECAUSE OF PILING UP STUFF- WE'RE- HAVING STORE STUFF. ETCETERA BUT DID NOT AND THIS IS THE TIME WE PAY THE PRICE FOR THAT. SO WITH THAT I REALIZE THAT I'M GOING TO MIL DESCRIBE SO THE WE CAN'T MIND CLOCK BACKS NO USED SPENDING A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO THAT. WEEKS AGO WE NEED. FOR BUT ONE THE BOARD. IS WHAT WE GET MORE. SOME TELL QUIT RATE DOUBT. FROM THE FACE THEY'RE SICK THAT THAT WILL IN THE EIGHT TIME PERIOD THE ISSUE ME THE AND I FIVE REST. OF THE COUNTY ISSUE OTHER WAS ALSO A RECALL FROM CARDINAL OF SURGICAL GOWNS THAT WAS THE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOLES IN THE SWISS CHEESE JUST LINED UP- AND WE JUST CAN'T FORGET THAT THE FACE SHIELDS ARE CRITICAL PIECE OF ALL OF THIS TO. ALL RIGHT. TWELVE TO TALK TO DC ABOUT TELEPHONIC VISITS AND OBVIOUSLY I KNOW WE HAVE THE MAIN REQUIRE FEDERAL ACTION TO BUT OKAY YES THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL AND HEALTH CENTERS ARE REALLY WANTING TO TRIAGE THEIR PATIENTS OVER THE PHONE ITS GUIDANCE THE CDC HAS RECOMMENDED- AND THEY'RE REALLY YOU'RE OUT THERE THAT TOOK INTO THE HEALTH CENTER IF THEY ARE PRETENDING SIX SO. I THE SERVICE OVER THE PHONE. SB IT WOULD UP ALLOW MORE SPACE IN THE HEALTH CENTER AS WELL AND THEY WOULD HAVE MORE ABILITY FOR SEARCH CAPACITY FOR WHEN AND IF AND WHEN YOU KNOW. HOSPITALS NEED TO SEND THEIR NON PATIENTS TO US THAT WE BE GREAT OKAY. THEN I GUESS IN TERMS OF. OWNERS HOMES I MEAN THE STATE'S THE PLACE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS PARTICULAR AFFECTION MOST TERRIFYING BECAUSE WE'RE SAID THE- I MEAN TWENTY PERCENT. MORTALITY RATE IN PEOPLE OVER SEVENTY- SO. AND WE SAW THAT IN THAT NURSING HOMES AND SO EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT TWELVE THERE SO. IN NURSING AS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE BEEN EXPOSED SO I GUESS. YOU TALKED ABOUT NOT PUTTING OF COURSE. HOUSING PEOPLE BUT ALSO I MEAN I DON'T. THREE TURNER NURSING HOMES IN THE FORCE LIKE EVERYONE STAY AWAY AND OBVIOUSLY YOU SCREAM THE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THEM AND SO FORTH PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO COME INTO WORK. THANK YOU FOR WE AS SOON AS- AND- INDUSTRY FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT. SINCE THE RISK IS GREATEST TO OUR FOLKS DEREK WE TAKE THE MOST. PREVENTIVE MEDICATION STEPS TO PROTECT THEM. AB WE'VE NOT BEEN TOLD THAT THIS FOR HER WRISTS WITH. THE DIRECTIONS WE'VE BEEN GIVEN IS THAT- THIS POTENTIALLY COULD BE- AB. CONTAGIOUS EVEN WITHOUT SHOWING SYMPTOMS RIGHT WE- TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND THAT'S A CONSERVATIVE STEP WE HAVE TO TAKE THE STEPS WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THE EVERYTHING BUT THAT'S THE BEST CHANCE WE- GIVE THE- CITY TO DO THAT. SO THAT SOUNDS A BIT MORE TESTS MORE SURVEILLANCE AT LEAST OF THIS. OF THE STAFF WHO WORKED THERE FOR SO YOU TRY TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE THERE MILDLY A SYMPTOMATIC. REALLY COME IN THE WORK. I DON'T KNOW IS THAT IS THERE'S AS VINCENT STRATEGY ABOUT NURSING HOMES AND PARTICULARLY THE FACT THE OF STAFF WE HAVE TO GO ON YOU KNOW COME IN AND OUT I GUESS WE CAN BAN NONESSENTIAL PERSONNEL TELL THEM THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE PHONE CALLS ARE LEFT UNSAID OF COMING IN WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE ACCESS TO WORK THERE. EVERY THOUGHT OF. BUT ABOUT. WHAT WHAT. WHAT'S THE PLAN IS. YEAH WE WANT. OUR STUDENTS. SO WE PUT OUT OF ACTION CONTROL GUIDANCE AS- OF THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO WITHIN THE FACILITY AND WE CERTAINLY ARE LOOKING OUT PROGRAM FLEXES. IN TERMS OF SYMPTOM TAX ON THAT SON. I'M AND EVEN RESTRICTIONS ON VETERANS AND STAFF. I'M AND- THE ANYBODY THAT'S EXPOSED TO ABOUT. CO IT. PATIENT HAS BEEN QUARANTINE THE REASON ROLES MAY BE NO TOWARD SYMPTOMS P. VERTEX OF THAT WERE NOT RISKING. THEM PASSING ON THIS TRANSMITTING THIS VIRUS THAT CAN I JUST POSE THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW TESTING IS NOT THE SILVER BALL DOESN'T SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT- IN LIKE IN THE ABSENT TESTING WHAT WE DO IS WE- COUNTY PEOPLE FOURTEEN DAYS. WITH TESTING WE ACTUALLY KNOW A REPOSITORY NOT WE DON'T NEED FOURTEEN DAYS RIGHT WE GET AN ANSWER ON THIS YOU MIGHT BE NEGATIVE ONE DAY AND TWO DAYS LATER RIGHT. AS I HAVE SAID EVEN IF YOU'RE SYMPTOMATIC ON ONE DAY AND THEN THREE DAYS LATER YOU'RE STILL SYMPTOMATIC AND WE TEST YOU AGAIN SO WE'RE A LITTLE. OUT OF ALL SUNSET THIRTY FROM THAT AND SO WE DO THINK WE'RE TAKING. AN AX IN TERMS OF. I PEOPLE. CLOSE I SWEAR PEOPLE BETTER. SECOND COME WHY THEY'RE BEING TASK OR WITH KIND. AND QUARANTINE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE CONTACT UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THEIR- BABY THEY'RE SERVED UP A QUARANTINE PERIOD OR IF THEY'RE VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH TEST BOB. AND THREE THE TESTS ARE ANALYST'S SENSITIVITY SPECIFICITY TODAY I MEAN TO PCR RIGHT SO THEY WANT TO TALK TO A JAIL TERMS A FALSE POSITIVE FALSE NEGATIVE RATES. AND I GUESS WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TESTING WERE WERE SO WORRIED BUT LET'S START DOING A LARGE LARGE NUMBER TESTING ANY OF THE THING WAS A FALSE POSITIVE WHAT MAKE FALSE NEGATIVE RATES RIGHT. IT IS OUR PEACE HERE TESTS AT. THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD- THE LIMIT OF DETECTION IS TEN. COPIES SO THAT'S A VERY LOW LIMITED OKAY SO WE THINK THE SENSITIVITY IS VERY HIGH ALREADY HAVE NOT SEEN ISSUE WITH- WITH FALSE POSITIVE OKAY. ALL RIGHT THAT'S HELPFUL- ALL RIGHT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL- I GUESS WILL BE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO AND- FIGURE OUT AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'RE LEARNING THINGS THAT WILL SINCE THIS IS A BUDGET HEARING AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND- WHO NEEDS FOR WILL BE IN. JUNE KNOW ONE CAN ARGUE. BERNIE ITSELF. THE OVER THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO BUT I DON'T KNOW- WOULD ACTUALLY TRY TO STRETCH IT OUT. EIGHT TWO ONE TO STRETCH IT OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OUR HOSPITALS GET OVERWHELMED AT ONE TIME- BUT ALSO HOPEFULLY- WE WILL NOT FORGET WHAT WERE FACING A IN. THE AND THINK ABOUT ALLOCATING SOME RESOURCES TO BEING BETTER PREPARED NOT THEM GEN I'D SAY THAT WE TOOK SOME STEPS NOT THAT WE HUNDRED THIRD I MEAN WE- PLAN WE- EXECUTING THAT PLAN WILL PUT ADDITIONAL SOURCES BUT I THINK WE- NOTE BEHIND.

IS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POINT THREE MILLION. THIRTY FOUR EIGHTEEN POINT TWO MILLION. HE'S BEEN. PORT ONCE. 4% WHEN COMPARED TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACTS THE NET DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROJECTED MEDICATION EXPENDITURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROJECTED TO INCREASE A PRIVATE INSURANCE MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES AND CHANGES IN ITS BUDGET OR DO YOU COMPARE TO TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THAT WITH A- PIECE OF EIGHT.

AND ELIMINATE CONFLICTS IN CURRENT LAW. THANK YOU WILLIAM FINANCE OKAY ALL THIS ONLY GOOD THINGS TO DO. ALRIGHT LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX THE PROCTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SO THIS IS OUR SECOND TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL. A PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO ALLOW THE PROPER SYSTEMS PROGRAM TO PAY FOR AN INITIAL THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF PROP AND PET MEDICATION. CURRENT STATUTE LIMITS CALL PRESCRIPTIONS. FOR PROP APP THAT FOR PREVENT TO FURNISH UP TO FOURTEEN DAYS A PREP AND PET MEDICATION FOR AN INITIAL DISPENSE. AND ALSO UP TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS A PATH FOR MEDICATION OR MEDICATIONS FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. UNTIL RECENTLY PROVIDED WAS THE ONLY FDA APPROVED MEDICATION FOR PROP AND IT'S A COMPONENT AND THE FIRST LINE- RECOMMENDED TAP REGIMENS. GILEAD SCIENCES IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MANUFACTURER PROVIDED AND ONLY PACKAGES FOR BONTA IN BOTTLES CONTAINING THIRTY TABLETS. THE FDA'S EXPECTATIONS IS THAT DRUGS ARE REPACKAGING ACCORDANCE WITH THE- HANDLING AND STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED AN FDA APPROVED LABELING. THE PACKAGE INSERT FOR TREVAN I DID BY THE DRUG MANUFACTURER SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTS DISPENSABLE IN THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER. BUT ONLY MEANT TO MANY HAS BEEN REACHING OUT AND SENDING LETTERS TO RE PACKAGERS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTING THEM- TO STOP- REPACKAGING BOTTLES OF TOMATOES. AND TO THAT AND RE PACKAGERS ARE RESISTANT TO VIOLATING THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN MOST OF SEIZE REPACKAGING OF THE MEDICATION. PLEASE BARRIERS TO PROP UP AS AN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PROVISION AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN UNABLE TO- PREPPING PART FOURTEEN DAY PRE PACKAGED DOSES IT DOSAGES AND IS UNABLE TO CONTRACT THE PHARMACIES TO BREAK UP EXISTING BOTTLES. HELLO FINANCE SO. SO BASICALLY THIS IS GOING TO COST FEE REBATE FUND BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY THOUSAND ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER OF THE DRUGS IS UNWILLING TO PACKAGE IT IN A WILL PAY THAT I MEAN I COULD I COULD YOU KNOW I MEAN IS THERE SOME PLACE WE CAN. BUT FIRST OF ALL THE QUESTION IS THIS RIGHT- WE PUT THOSE LIMITS. SO FROM A TREATMENT POINTED VIEWED AS APPROPRIATE ARE. OR IS IT THERE IS PROVIDING EVERY THIRTY DAYS STILL THE BETTER THING TO DO I MEAN I GUESS SO THAT'S ASIDE FROM WHETHER DATE IT OR NOT WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING. FOURTEEN DAY THIS IS OPTIMAL WAY TO GO ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IS THAT WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS THE NATIONAL DISPENSED. YOUR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLIENT'S ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROP OUT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND SO. BY PROVIDING THIRTY DAYS WE ALSO GET THE ADDED BENEFIT OF. BEING ABLE TO NOW. THE CLIENT TO OTHER RESOURCES FOR ARGO PLANE- PROVISION FOR A- MEDICATION. AND SO FOR PAP. ALLOW YOU THIRTY DAYS ACTUALLY ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW INITIATE THAT ENTIRE REGIMENT ON THE FRONT END AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO. SCRAMBLE AND FIND ANOTHER PAIR RESOURCES COMPLETE. OKAY AND THEN. THAT ON PATH RIGHT I'M TUCKER I TRAINED IN A PRESS. YOU SAID THIS ALLOWS IT'S TIME TO NAVIGATE THEM TO OTHER PAY RESOURCES FOR THEIR THERE'S NOT A GAP IN THEIR RIGHT. SENATE REGS THOSE AS I MEAN I GUESS. I'M DOING IT IF THE MAIN REASON IS ACTUALLY WE'RE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW WE GOTTA GET BETTER OUTCOMES RIGHT- I HATE TO SAY THAT WE ARE HAVING TO SPEND MORE MONEY BECAUSE I MEAN FACTURE IS CITED. I'M GOING. KEYGEN THE STERN WAY FORCE YOU TO BUY MORE THE MEDICATIONS. RIGHT I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONVERSATION THEN WITH THAN AND IN IT AND IS THAT- THAT'S THE ONLY CAR WITH SOMEONE ELSE COMING ON LINE WITH THE ARE NOT. GENERIC SHIMADA IS- SCHEDULED TO HIT THE MARKET I BELIEVE SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND I BELIEVE HAVE A PHARMACEUTICALS IS GONNA EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS AND- AS THE SOLE MANY FACTORS. FOR ABOUT A YEAR OKAY SO I GUESS I GUESS THE THING IS THIS RIGHT I MEAN. THREE DAYS IS KELLY TO THEIR OUTCOMES GOT THAT. NOTES GUNS COST A LITTLE MORE MAY WE GET BETTER OUTCOMES AND BUT TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING MORE MONEY PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF WELL BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURERS USES TO AND THEN YEAH. TO GET GO **** MAYBE EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY. THIRTY PROVIDE. BASIC FORCED TO. GIVE YOU KNOW SPEND MORE JUST BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER ONLY WANTS TO BE A FIXTURES IN CERTAIN PACKAGE AND I GET YOU KNOW I GET THE RATE. IS WHY THEY DON'T PEOPLE CAN OPEN AND LIKE THAT NO TERMS OF. BUT THAT THAT'S THE TO ME WOULD BE IS. FRUSTRATING AND THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA OPENING STATEMENT TO MAKE ACTOR. ABOUT THIS IS THAT. IF YOU JUST SPENDING MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY- TAKE IT. NUMBER MAGIC THE THIRTY. THANKS FOR IS A IS A- NARAL OF TINA FEY MIGHT BE WHAT PIC A THE OKAY FOR EIGHT THIRTY RELEASE SO JUST PICK. BUT IT ADDS THAT MAKES IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND WE'RE IN TOTAL AGREEMENT WE DID INITIATE THE MANUFACTURER IN DISCUSSIONS EARLY ON DURING OUR DISCOVERY PHASE. AND FOR WE WERE TOLD THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CHANGE THEIR- THEIR APPLE DISPENSING. OKAY OUR EIGHT. OKAY. YES MOVE ON FOR THAT OKAY WELL YOU IT'S FEDERAL OF THE WORLD MAYBE WE CAN KEEP HAVING DISCUSSIONS. ALL RIGHT. ISSUE SEVEN EIGHT APP AND ROMAN SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SO THE EIGHT UP IN ROMAN SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT BCP REQUEST NINE POSITIONS AND FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION FROM THE EIGHT I APPRECIATE FINE STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS. THAT HAPPEN ROMAN SYSTEM THE A. S. WAS INITIALLY-DEVELOPED AS AN INTERIM SOLUTION TO SUPPORT A DOCTORAL BENEFITS MANAGEMENT IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. DUE TO THE EMERGENCY NATURE OF IT XIN TURKEY I WENT LIVE AS A MINIMAL SOLUTION BILL ALL THE WITH FOR ALL THE NECESSARY TO MAN. LG THE INFORMATION OVER TIME. BUT SHOULD NOMINAL.

SO THE CUSTOMERS AND THEIR CALL CENTER COMPONENT WE BROUGHT IN HOUSE AND WERE HANDLE IN THAT WOULD STATE STAFF. AND OF. A. S.

OKAY AND I'LL COVER STDS CUT THE MUSTARD WITH THE CENTRAL ACCESS HEALTH ARE STD PREVENTION FROM CENTER WORKS CLOSELY WITH STATE STD PREVENTION OUR LOCAL- COUNTY PARTNERS WELL. IT WAS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS ONE OF THEM IS TO TAKE CURRENT. CALIFORNIA FOR PACK GRAHAM X. TO LOCK TO SERVE THOSE NOT A RISK. MISSY OR NEED A OF CUT. NOW BECAUSE THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED WE WOULD NEED TO USE DEBT GENERAL ONLY BUT THAT WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE COMING IN THAT IF. BRAND THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY ARE THE MET LGBT COMMUNITY ARE NON COMMENTING THIS THE THIS PRO TO GET S. T. TERVIS. NOT WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE- THE CHECK.

LIES THAT PROGRAM WHICH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO SIR FOLKS IN THAT PROGRAM WE'RE ASKING FOR ME IN THE FIRST TO INCREASE GENERAL FUND- PUT CAN OFTEN BE INTO THE FAMILY. DO YOU THAT PRO. PEACE ACCESS TO STD TREATMENT. ON THE OTHER ES DE PROPOSAL IS A PLAY OFF OF LAST YEAR'S WE HAVE SEVEN MILLION CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET FOR S. T. D. UM TESTE TREATMENT USE BOOKS COUNTY ARE COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE WITH THOSE DAHLE. DOLLAR JUST THREE. ENTRY TO SEE TO BE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE AS- WILL HAVE AS GO OUT BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT TO DEFERRED FOR PARTNER IN C. B. IS TO USE THOSE DOLLAR. BECAUSE THIS POINT THE DO ARE THE SET. MAY BE ON GOING AS IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE COUNTY PARTNERS NAY SECURED. HEARD ALL TODAY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SPENDING IT'S MUCH EASIER TO HAVE ON GOING DOLLARS TO BE UP IN STRUCTURE. AND PRODUCE PERSONNEL TO DO. TESTING AND TREATMENT. WELL SO IN THIS CASE YOU'RE ASKING FOR CHRIS OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT THE ES D. ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA ENTER COUNTRY BOOKED.

I'M THANK THERE'S AN AT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH APPETITE ESTY AND OVER MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE UNAWARE OF THEIR STATUS LEAVE THEM BOTH. ANSWER COMPLICATIONS EVEN DEATH AS WELL AS THE REST FOR TRANSMITTING TO OTHERS THE RATE OF HCV INFECTION AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE- WHICH IS THOSE UNDER THIRTY IS GROWING AT AN ALARMING DRIVEN. BY THE DEBIT IN OUR WHEN AND OTHER DRUG USE BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN AND SIX HUNDRED THREE EIGHT CV KEEP. REPORT ADD ON PEOPLE IF TEAMS. ATTRACT I'M A SIXTEEN ARE THIRTY THOUSAND. NEARLY FORTY K. CV WHICH RANKS CALIFORNIA AS THE FIRST AMONG ALL STATES TO PUBLISH THEIR SURVEILLANCE DATA SO WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED IN COVERING HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT WHICH WE APPRECIATE THROUGH MEDICARE OUR PRISONS. AND THAT DOES ARE PRESENT AT THIS POINT FOR OVER 95% OF PEOPLE- IT'S WE REALLY HAVE UNDER INVESTED IT LIKE HEALTH- PREVENTION I'M INFRASTRUCTURE THE LAST YEAR FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION WAS THE FIRST EIGHT THE PREVENTION FUNDING. SIXTEEN AND NOT FUND IT IS NOT FOR THE LEVEL OF PREVENT NAVIGATION AND LOOK ITIS UNNECESSARY YEAH. AT UNIVERSAL HEPATITIS C. SCREENING- SO WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL SEE MORE- SCREENING IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY TO REACH DRUG POP WE'RE CURRENTLY A MUCH LESS. I AM. RESEARCH FROM THE AMERICAN STUDY FOR ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF LIVER DISEASE- STATES THAT ADDRESSING GAPS IN PREVENTION AND CARE AMONG USE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO TREAT- ENDING THE ATV EPIDEMIC SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY AN AND PRESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AND STEVE MAC OR TO AB FOR YEARS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A CURE IN HCV IS SO CALM. EXCITE LINK TO THAT. M. TRUST. I'M SPOKE WERE COMING BACK WITH THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR- REQUEST FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR AIDS HEPATITIS C. I'M AND THEN I'M BACK COVER ASK ON- HJV SO THAT AND THE OTHER. ELECTION AGAIN THANKS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ARE INVESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN HIV PREVENTION LAST YEAR- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE DOLLARS ME TO I'M GOING FUNDING AND AGAIN WE'RE BACK WITH THE REST OF OUR REQUEST WHICH IS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GENERAL FUND. WHICH WOULD BE ON GOING FOR ADDRESSING AM HIV HEALTH AND TWENTY PARTICULARLY AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CALIFORNIA COMMITMENT TO REINVESTING IN ITS PREVENTION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE'RE VERYAPPRECIATIVE OF THAT- AND- WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE HIV CASES DECLINING AS A RESULT OF THAT INCREASED PREVENTION FUNDING SO- ALL THE WORDS WERE MUCH- BEHIND NEW YORK CORRECT PRESENTED EARLIER WE HAVE A REST NINE CENT IN OUR IN IN FACT TENS. ONLY THAT NOT ALL OF US DIFFERENT. SO WHILE CASES HAVE TO AMONG WHITES BY OVER 20% IN THAT TIME PERIOD THEY'VE DECREASED ONLY 4% AMONG A LOT NEXT COMMUNITY AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY INCREASED BY THE INCREASED AND EQUITIES REALLY UNDERSCORE HOW URGENT THE NEED IS FOR THE IMPROVED FOR AND ANY ENTITY TAKE PREVENTION EFFORTS AND REALLY THAT DATE THOSE EFFORTS TO TARGET THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING FUNDING. TO LOCAL SECTION AND- ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF PLANS BASED AND STRENGTH BASED STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE BIOMEDICAL PREVENTION STRUCTURAL SHINS TEN. NEEDS OF THE STATE'S MOST UNDERSERVED RESIDENTS THANK YOU.

SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN THE CLEARING HOUSE FUND WAS DEVELOPED THERE HAVE BEEN THIRTEEN NEW SYRINGE SERVICES PROGRAM STARTED AND TEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR WE EXPECT AN ADDITIONAL SIX PROGRAMS WITH MORE GROWTH- EXPECTED EACH YEAR. SO A DISH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS EXISTING SERVICES PROGRAM SEEN AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES BY OVER 50% THE GROWTH IN NEW PROGRAMS PAIRED WITH THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES IN EXISTING PROGRAMS. ME THE CURRENT BUDGET THREE PER IS A QUICK PROGRAM TO BETWEEN ORDER AND THE LOCKS ON OR ORDER ENOUGH STEROLS OF SEARCHES FOR THE PARTICIPANTS. THERE SURRENDERS REPRESENT THE NUMBER ONE MOST COST EFFECTIVE H. A. B. N. H. C. B. PREVENTION TOOL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS PROVIDE LOW BARRIER RESOURCES TO PEOPLE OFTEN REFERRED TO IT'S HARD TO REACH. MONEY INVESTED IN THESE PROGRAMS MEANS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SAVED AND AVERTED HIV EIGHT CB AND S. T. I. CASE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FEWER OVERDOSED A DEATH.
