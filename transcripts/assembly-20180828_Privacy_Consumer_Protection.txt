WE HAVE ELEVEN ELEVENTH TWENTY ONE AND BEFORE WE START -- I LIKE. TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS SO. BECAUSE OF THAT PROCEDURE TIMING ISSUE THE AUTHOR. AND COMMITTEE HAVE AGREED TO AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PRINT POP PROCESS YESTERDAY AND ARE IN PRINT TODAY. THIS WAS DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL CAN BE HEARD IN A TIMELY MANNER IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE NEXT. I SHOULD THIS COMMITTEE PASSED THE BILL -- TO BE CLEAR THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN DENOUNCES WELL IN ANTICIPATION OF TODAY'S HEARING -- SPECIFICALLY THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRST THREE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS INDIAN ALICE'S ON PAGES SEVEN THREE EIGHT UNDER COMMENT. FOR ITEM NUMBER FOUR ON CORRECTING TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION AND A SEPARATE SUGGESTION TO ADD CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO AB. THREE SEVEN FIVE ON THE ISSUE OF ADVERTISING WILL NEED TO BE REVISITED NEXT YEAR. AS THE CLEAN UP EFFORT TO AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE ARE CONTINUES. SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THESE AMENDMENTS AND FOR THE WORK BETWEEN THIS OFFICE IN THE STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE SUMMER TO GET THIS CLEAN UP VEHICLE TO THIS POINT. AND WITH THAT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO THE AUTHOR HOW TO PRESENT ABOUT SENATORS. TERRIFIC THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. A FIRST I WANT -- TO I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY I WOULD HAVE THIS CLEAN UP BILL IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE GREAT WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO AND HIS STAFF. AND CENTER HERTZBERG AND HIS STAFF. AND AS A KIND OF WOUND DOWN HERE TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- IT GOT A LITTLE BIT DICEY FROM TIME TO TIME BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY THIS IS HOW THE HOUSES SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. AND I THINK -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN USE THIS AND EGGS AS AN EXAMPLE AS WE WIND DOWN ON ON OTHER ISSUES I LIKE TO THINK THAT -- BAKER STAFF IN THE PRO TEM STAFF FOR COMING TOGETHER -- ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE HERE BEFORE US TODAY. BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR I WAS PROUD TO CO AUTHORED YOU KNOW A I CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THAT. CENTER HERTZBERG CHAIRMAN CHAO WITHOUT ACT CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTION. IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THE ACT IS STRONG CLEAR AS POSSIBLE S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WAS DESIGNATED. AS THE VEHICLE FOR CLARIFICATIONS. THAT THE AUTHORS AGREED TO WHEN S. B. AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS PASSED. IN THE WEEKS SINCE EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW MY OFFICE SENATOR HERTZBERG OFFICE. CHAIRS OPPOSITE COMMITTEE STAFF OF ON THAT WITH DOZENS OF STAKEHOLDERS DISCUSSING AN INCREDIBLE VARIETY OF ISSUES A PROPOSED CHANGES THE CALIFORNIA. CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. AS HE ANALYSIS DALLAS'S NOTES THIS BILL NOW REFLECTS AGREEMENTS REACHED. BETWEEN THE AUTHORS OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMITMENT. OF THE AUTHORS WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD IN THE COMMITTEE LAST MONTH [inaudible] A SPECIFICALLY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. I THINK SINCE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE THAT YOU GUYS ALL HAVE THIS LANGUAGE I MEAN AND I NOT READ ALL THIS TODAY. BUT I THINK THAT THE OUT LAST NIGHT'S -- ADDITONAL AMENDMENTS WERE WERE MADE AND IT DELETED NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THE AG BEFORE CONSUMER COULD FILE ACTION. IT MAKES TECHNICAL FIX FIXES IT ADDS MORE CLARIFYING FLYING WILL LIVE. CLARIFYING LANGUAGE REGARDING HIP BUT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CHANGES THOUGHTFULLY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THEY CANNOT WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR WHILE PROTECTING PRIVACY RIGHTS NOW. UP FOR CALIFORNIANS. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT TAKE YOUR MUCH AS SENATOR DR LET'S TURN TO SENATOR HERTZBERG. NOW HE WAS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY. THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST EXPERIENCED SUCH ADVOCATES AND MEMBERS. THAT THIS PROCESS. HAS BEEN UNIQUE FOR SERIES OF REASONS. ARM AND SO THE CORE OF THAT UNIQUENESS WAS. TOO WAS TO BIT BAKIN THIS FRAMEWORK BUT TIME. TO THINK THROUGH. ALL OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF PRIVACY. SO WE HAVE A YEAR BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE TO REALLY DESCRIBE THIS AND ANALYZE THIS AND OF COURSE. WHAT WE FOUND ALL OF US YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MR DOT MYSELF? WAS THAT EVERY ADVOCATE UNDER THE SUN EITHER A TRY -- TO PUT BELTS AND SUSPENDERS AS TO THINGS THAT RELATE TO THEIR INDUSTRY. I WANTED TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING NOTION WAS. THAT WILL BE FOR NEXT YEAR. AND SO THAT IS IS THAT MR DOT INDICATED THE AUTHOR AT BUT THIS MEASURE WE I THINK. TOOK DE DID DEALT WITH A LOT OF PRESSURE OF A LOT OF FOLKS AND REALLY DEALT WITH THE FOR UNDERLYING ISSUES. WE HAD IN THE HIPAA PROVISIONS CERTAINLY THE A. G. TIMING ISSUES AND THE EXTENSION. WELL ISSUES IN THE PREEMPTION ISSUES THAT WE FELT WERE SO OVERWHELMING A TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BUT I JUST WANNA. THANK MR DOT ORG THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU STAFF OF FOR ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BURDEN ONGOING ISSUE AND I THINK THAT. THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE OF THIS AND CONTENTS. BUT THAT WE WANTED A THE THE BALLOT MEASURE OFF THE BALLOT WAS BECAUSE IT IMPOSED A SUCH A HIGH THRESHOLD OF A VOTE THAT BASICALLY TOOK THE LEGISLATURE. OUT OF THE DISCUSSION OF PRIVACY WHICH IS GOING TO AYE AYE IN YOUR PRIVACY IS BEEN IS AROUND US FOR A LONG TIME. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A DYNAMIC ISSUE FROM WHICH THIS BODY NEEDS TO ENGAGE.

LET'S BRING BACK THE COMEY QUESTIONS COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SENATOR LOTT SENATOR HERTZBERG ONE THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE TIMING. OF THE BILLS WAS OUT OF OUR CONTROL ON THE FIRST BILL I KNOW YOU WORK VERY HARD ON AND THE TIMING WAS VERY SHORT ON THAT IN THIS ONE I REALIZE THAT WE'RE UNDER TIME PRESSURE JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME LEFT CONCESSIONS SO. NORMALLY LATEAMENDMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT CASE -- YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS WHAT WE HAD TO DO AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS ACTION THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR NEXT YEAR ALTHOUGH I'M SURE NEXT YEAR WILL BE HAVING. MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS. I WANTED TO HAVE. BRIEF CONVERSATION THOUGH ABOUT ONE THING THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND THAT'S REMOVING. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S A PLACE IN THE PRIMACY OF THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE ACTION -- DO WE HAVE A OF ROBUST DISCUSSION IN THE ORIGINAL BILL ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS -- STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES WITH THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED. WAS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD PRIMACY AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROSECUTE VIOLATORS. BEFORE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION COULD BE EXERCISED IN SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD WALK ME THROUGH JUST FOR A MINUTE THE REASONING BEHIND REMOVING THAT AND THIS RECENT AMENDMENT. TRAINED JOURNALISTS OF THE OPINION THAT HE IS NOT A REGULATOR. THAT HE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND FELT THAT ON WHAT WE WERE DOING BY VIRTUE OF CREATING THIS NEW PROCESS WHEREBY HE HAD TO REVIEW EVERY CLAIM. NOT AND WE WE INUNDATE HIS OFFICE WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN PROJECT IN THE THIRTY DAY DEADLINE. BUT THAT IT WE LITERALLY TURN HIM IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGULATOR AND HE FELT THAT THAT WASN'T REALLY THE APPROPRIATE ROLE. AND ANSWER CAME FROM. OKAY I I CAN WE TALK ABOUT IS A POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW IT'S HITS IT'S NOT UNIQUE IN THIS BILL HE HAS THAT RIGHT IN -- OTHER AREAS THAT THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED REGULATION OVER. OUGHT TO TAKE ACTION AND YOU KNOW HE CAN CHOOSE WHETHER NOT TO EXERCISE IT AND FUTURE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MAY MAY OR MAY NOT SHARE HIS VIEW POINT ON IT SO. I DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE THE HARM WAS IN LEAVING THAT END BECAUSE ALL HE HAS TO DO IS NOTHING. AND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION STILL WHICH SO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WERE TAKING THAT OUT. BUT YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT I THINK CERTAINLY THESE AMENDMENTS DO FAR MORE. GOOD THAN HARM I AM HOPEFUL THAT NEXT YEAR AS WE HAVE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO THIS -- WE CAN WE CAN INCLUDE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FINE TUNE AT A TO HONOR THE SPIRIT OF THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS YOU KNOW. THAT REALLY WAS A BIG PART OF THE DISCUSSION ROW KNOWS THAT CHAIRMAN KNOWS THAT HE KNOWS A BIG ISSUE ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO PUT THE AG IN THIS THING BUT QUITE FRANKLY WHEN HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE DEBATING WITH HIS OFFICE. THEY ARE TRYING TO YOU KNOW NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT THE PROPONENT MR MCTAGGART WOULD AGREE TO THAT WOULD GET TO THE VERY ESSENCE OF AND I THINK THE NUB OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME KIND OF PRE REVIEW. SO THINGS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LITIGATED AND THERE WAS SOME PROCESS BUT I DO THINK THAT IT AS WE FOCUS ON IT NEXT YEAR IF YOU CAN HELP US ON THAT HELP SQUAD THAT COME WITH AN IDEA THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO THERE IS SOME ESSENCE TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. ABOUT TRYING TO AVOID EVERYTHING GOING TO LITIGATION AKA THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE COMMENT I WILL CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE AND IN THE NEXT YEAR SO BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS ARE ALSO. A BUT THE WE DID RECEIVE A LETTER FROM THE EIGHTIES OFFICER OF BASICALLY OUTLINING SOME OF THE CONCERNS ALSO SO WE DON'T WANT TO JAM SOMETHING DOWN HIS THROAT YOU KNOW WITHOUT. HIM COME TRY TO COMPLY ELISE SO WILL CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE ABSOLUTELY SIR. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
