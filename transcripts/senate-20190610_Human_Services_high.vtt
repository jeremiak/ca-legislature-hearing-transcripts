00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.199
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.934
THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.469

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.883
BECAUSE LIKE A SO THE REASON WHY

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.118
WE ADDED AT NEAR ZERO EMISSION

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:01.419
IS BECAUSE I INFRASTRUCTURE

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.454
DOESN'T EXIST AROUND THE STATE.

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:05.456
TO HAVE ALL ELECTRIC SO WE

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.724
DIDN'T WANT TO EXCLUDE THOSE

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.060

MEDICAL PPOINTMENTS.

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.102
SO THAT'S WHY WE ADDED THAT I

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.737
MEAN IF THERE'S ZERO EMISSION

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:22.006

CENTER PAN.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.986
SO I I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:18.555
TO AND YOUR I THINK ALL OF US

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:19.889
REPRESENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.958
COUNTIES THAT STRUGGLES

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:22.759
HOMELESSNESS AS WELL.

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.894
WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:26.496
LIMITING THE COUNTIES JUST TO

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:30.967
THE? SIX THEIR HERE WHICH I MEAN

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:33.370
WAS I I DON'T SEE THE CONTENDERS

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:34.838
IN WHAT THE CONCERN WAS AT FIRST

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:35.839
I WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:36.906
IT'S AND I THINK THE IDEA OF

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.942
DOING PREVENTION AND GETTING

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:39.909
AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:40.977
SAID WAIT TILL SO FALLS OFF THE

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.145
CLIFF IS REALLY IMPORTANT ONE

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.480
NOW I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHY

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:46.182
CAN'T WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF THIS

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:47.450
AS WELL.

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:48.018
LOONEY CERVANTES OF THE THE

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.452
PREVIOUS COMMITTEE SUGGESTED

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.287
THAT WE NARROWED DOWN TO SEE IF

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:52.322
IF IT'LL WORK IN THERE WAS SOME

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:56.126
QUESTIONS ABOUT AROUND THE ISSUE

00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:58.094
OF PRIVACY -- ORIGINALLY WE

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.229
STARTED WITH THE ENTIRE STATE

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:00.230
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS IS A

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:02.432
STATE WIDE PROBLEM -- IF IT'S UP

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.200
TO ME -- I'D RATHER MAKE IT

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.970
STATE WIDE -- BUT WE HAD TO

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:07.437
ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:08.838
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.173
DO DO DO EAT EGGS YOU COULD YOU

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.241
ELABORATE PERHAPS THEY KNOW THAT

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.909
YOU'RE NOT COMMITTEE YOU WERE

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.411
YOU HAD ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:16.212
THAT WATER CHOICE BUT AT ONCE A

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:17.847
PRIVACY ISSUES I MEAN WAS THERE

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:18.882
SOMETHING ABOUT NORTHERN

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.583
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE CENTRAL

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.686
VALLEY COUNTIES THAT.

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:26.489
WE WERE AT THAT THE COURT WE

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:29.759
WERE PRETTY GOOD HAILING PRIVACY.

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:30.260
MAY I RESPOND.

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:32.128
YEAH THE ISSUE WHAT THE ISSUE

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:33.730
WAS AND THAT OTHER COUNTIES

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:34.564
COULDN'T ON DEPRIVED CITY SHE

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:36.299
WAS ENSURING THAT WE WOULD DO --

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:38.201
PRIVACY CORRECTLY AND THAT IT

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:38.535
WOULDN'T BE.

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:40.003
BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUES

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.306
WITH THAT I I I THINK THAT WAS

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.909
EXACTLY WAS TOLD US.

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.243
A BOOK I'D BE HAPPY CHANGE I

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:47.877
CAN'T CHANGE SHOULD BE --

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.212
BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:49.846
HAD SUGGESTED THAT IDEA BUT I'D

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:50.647
BE OPEN AND WILLING TO WORK WITH

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:51.915
YOU TO GET IT CHANGED ABSOLUTELY

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.818
I'D HAVE TO HAVE THE MIND OF THE

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:55.752
PREVIOUS CAMINO.

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.355
SURE OKAY -- I UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.690
DILEMMA -- I HOPE PERHAPS WE CAN

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:01.458
RAISE THE QUESTION THAT WE WOULD

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.859
GIVE ACTUALLY COUNTIES THE

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:04.527
OPTION.

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.096
THAT YOU KNOW -- STUDENTS TO TO

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:06.796
TO DO THIS IF THEY WISHED I

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.665
THINK THAT WOULD BE YEAH COUNTY

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.400
DOESN'T THAT'S FINE -- BUT I

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.169
HOPE THAT WE CAN.

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:15.038
MAYBE MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE.

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.039
COUNTIES COULD IF THEY CHOSE TO

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:17.741
DO SO SELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:19.509
THIS ADD MORE IN LINE WITH YOUR

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:23.012
ORIGINAL BILL AND CERTAINLY --

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:24.214
THE BIKE THINK ABOUT HOW WE

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.316
COULD WORK WITH YOU AND THE

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:28.151
ASSEMBLY PRIZE COMMITTEE -- TO

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.552
TO BE SURE THAT IF THERE WERE

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.154
SPECIFIC PRIVACY CONCERNS THEY

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.522
HAD ABOUT OTHER COUNTIES COMING

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:33.356
ABOARD THAT WE GET THIS

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.258
ADDRESSED BUT TO GET TO A PLACE

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:35.825
WHERE.

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.361
COUNTIES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO.

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:40.296
WOULD BE ABLE -- TO AVAIL

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:44.067
THEMSELVES OF OF OF OF YOUR BILL

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:44.367
[inaudible]

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:47.036
IN.

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.872
MADAM CHAIR MY RESPOND.

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:51.007
YEAH SIR.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.041
YEAH WE DID A PREVIOUS BILL

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:53.643
WHERE THAT ONE WAS STATE WIDE IF

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.911
IF MY MEMORY SERVES IN LOAN THAT

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:58.081
WAS AB TWO TEN AND THAT SEEMS TO

00:56:58.148 --> 00:56:59.382
BE GO IT WILL BE GOING IN

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.450
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.318
BUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:03.353
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:04.721
THAT IS THAT I WOULD THINK IT'S

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.423
A STATEWIDE -- CONCERN AND THE

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.957
REASON IT WAS NEAR THOSE

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.292
PARTICULAR COUNTIES IS BECAUSE

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.827
WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN MORE

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.061
THAN JUST LA COUNTY BY SAYING

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:13.530
THAT IT'S A REGIONAL.

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:14.564
ISSUE OTHERWISE I THINK YOU MAY

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.232
BE BEEN BEEN TAPERED A LITTLE

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:17.867
BIT -- MORE NARROW -- BUT

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.035
CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S A

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.337
SPIRIT OF ON SHARING INFORMATION

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:22.939
THAT WOULD EXTEND FROM THE FIRST

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.874
BILL THAT WE DID -- WHICH

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:25.375
ALLOWED THE SHARING OF

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:28.778
INFORMATION -- ONE SOMEBODY WAS

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:30.446
HOMELESS AND LET ME.

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.347
WALK YOU THROUGH JUST TO REFRESH

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:32.916
YOUR MEMORY BUT IF SOMEBODY --

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:33.650
WAS HOMELESS IN THE VISITED --

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.785
LET'S A PROBATION OFFICER OR OR

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.020
OR SOMEBODY IN CAL WORKS

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.922
ETCETERA THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:41.524
CAN THEN SHARE THE INFORMATION --

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:44.561
OF THE RECIPIENT OF SERVICES

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.728
WITH ANOTHER COUNTY OR NONPROFIT

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.931
AGENCY OR CITY TO TRY TO GET

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:49.766
THAT PERSON AND THE USER --

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:50.800
SUPPORT SERVICES IT BASICALLY

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.302
THING CONCEPT I I WOULD I WOULD

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:54.904
AGREE WITH YOU BUT AND I WOULD --

00:57:54.971 --> 00:58:01.377
I WOULD HELP THOSE ARGUMENTS TO

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:04.047
INCLUDE OTHER COUNTIES.

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:06.616

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:11.754
THAT THIS IS NOT EXACT AND

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:12.455
SITUACIóN YOUR OWN CHOOSING

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:12.755

I'VE.

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:15.425
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:17.760
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:18.061
[inaudible]

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:19.863
I THOUGHT.

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:21.264
WELL I'M I'M CONFUSED NOW

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.867
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHERE ON THE

BILL IT.

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:27.003
IS LIMITED.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.005
RAPPER.

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:29.973
AND I DIDN'T SEE AN ANALYSIS

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:31.274
THAT DOESN'T SAID THE PRIVACY

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.909
COMMITTEE HEARD THE BILL.

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:36.579
IT SAYS ONLY EARNED SERVICES.

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:37.881
I THANK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:39.182

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:40.483
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S MINOR SO YOU

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.118

AMONG OTHER WAS A TECHNICAL AIR

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:44.754
WHIRLS NOT LIMITED AND SO THOSE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.956
AMENDMENTS HAD TO BE TAKEN AND

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.892
THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT THAT IT

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:49.792
WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME IN AND THE

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:53.830
PREVIOUS CONTRACT.

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:56.332
THAT'S CORRECT THERE WAS A FOR

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:57.800

ASSEMBLY IT WAS HUMAN SERVICES

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:00.503
PROSSER OKAY I THINK THERE'S A

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.738
TECHNICAL ERROR WITH THAT THAT'S

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:03.273
