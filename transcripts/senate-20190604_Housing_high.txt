COMMITTEE WHEN WELCOME EVERYONE THE HEARING WE HAVE -- SEVEN ITEMS -- TODAY FOUR OF THEM. ARE ON CONSENT OF WHO WAS ON THE RIVER [inaudible] ONE SEVENTEEN THIRTY OF MY APOLOGIES. THIS IS NOT A ELEVATED AGENDA THREE ARE ON CONSENSUS FOR ARE NOT -- WE DO NOT HAVE IT -- BERG A. R. QUORUM YET SO WE WILL BEGIN AND WILL -- ESTABLISH A QUORUM ONE MORE MEMBERS ARRIVED -- THE FIRST ITEM WHICH I'LL BE CO PRESENTING WITH -- CENTER ALLEN IS A CA ONE SALAS CENTER MORE LOCK TO TAKE THE GAVEL YEAH. THE CENTER WIENER DATA. IF YOU WISH TO PRESENT THE BILL OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO DEFER TO CENTER ALLEN. I JUST WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR THE COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE THAT SUMMER OKAY CENTER ALLEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS IF WE COULD HAVE FOR YOUR GOOD ATTENTION. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A ONE THANK YOU VERY TO MISS REST CHAIR -- AND MEMBERS I'M I'M VERY PLEAED TO BE HERE ALONGSIDE MY MY JOINT AUTHORED A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF CO SPONSORS THE PRESENT SENATE CONSTITUTION MOMENT. ONE I WHICH WOULD PLACE A MEASURE ON A FUTURE STATEWIDE BALLOT ASKING VOTERS TO REPEAL ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS PROVISION WAS PASSED BY VOTERS IN. NINETEEN FIFTY AND IT REQUIRES MAJORITY APPROVAL. BY THE VOTERS OF A CITY OR COUNTY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION -- ACQUISITION OF A PUBLICLY FUNDED LOW RENT HOUSING PROJECT THAT MEASURE WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL. HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY NINE WHICH WAS PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S FAIR DEAL TO HELP LOWER INCOME. POST WAR FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF THE SLUMS AND INTO BETTER LIVING SITUATIONS. NOW I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN ANYONE HERE ABOUT HOW MUCH THE GOLDEN STATE HAS CHANGED SINCE. NINETEEN FIFTY OUR SOCIETY AND HAD VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ABOUT RACE AND ETHNICITY CLASS AND POVERTY AT THE TIME THEY WERE ALSO FAR LESS TOOLS PROVIDING RESIDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALTER A BLOCK PLANS FOR YOU HOUSING THERE WAS NO. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT THE WHAT NO BROWN ACT NO COASTAL ACT FAR FEWER LAWSUITS IN GENERAL. I TODAY ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR STANDS AS ANACHRONISTIC AN EXPENSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER THAT SUBJECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A WEB REGULATIONS A COSTLY ELECTIONS. THAT END UP DRIVING UP THE PRICE OF BUILDING PUBLICLY FINANCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOUSING THAT IS APPROVED BY THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LOCAL ELECTRIC. CALIFORNIA HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE AROUND HOMES FOR EVERYONE HUNDRED EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS -- I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS ISSUE TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSING COMMITTEE BUT A MEMBER MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S RENTERS SPENT MORE THAN A THIRD. SORRY MEANT SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING NEARLY ONE THIRD OF OUR POPULATION SPENDS MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME JUST. FOR A PLACE TO LIVE 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ALSO CHOOSE ALSO LIVE CLOSE TO OUR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. SO THESE HIGH HOUSING COSTS OF OF YOU KNOW WITH THESE HIGH HOUSING COSTS OF OF ONE SIMPLE AND SMALL FINANCIAL SETBACK COULD SPELL CATASTROPHE. TOO MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS ARE ONE MISTAKE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S PART OF WHY WE'RE SEEING AN UPTICK IN HOMELESSNESS SO NO ONE PERSON OR POLICIES TO BLAME FOR THE SITUATION IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE SPENT TIME AND HAD HAVE SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT. THEY WANT -- TO THEY WANT US AS THEIR LEADERS TO DO BETTER BY THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR STRUGGLING TO FIND. IN A FOR HOUSING. SUPPORTING STATE LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES THE DEDICATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER MONEY TO ADD TACKLE OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND IN THE STUDY I'VE GOT SEVERAL A LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLES I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH. THE MEMBERS -- THERE IS A THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE THAT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR HAS PROVEN TO BE A AS AS INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING CONSTRUCTION VERTICALLY. FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS IN THE END OF THE DAY ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO ALLOW THE LOCAL ACTED OFFICIALS WHO HAVE WHERE ACCOUNTABLE LOCALLY TO THE VOTERS LOCALLY. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAY AS TO WHETHER THEY WANTED TO BUILD THIS KIND OF HOUSING -- WE NEED TO TAKE THIS MEASURE OUT OF THE THE CONSTITUTION I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN PUTTING IN THE CLUSTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. HAVE NOW NOT ONLY COME AROUND TO A NEUTRAL POSITION BUT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT -- FOLKS AS DIVERSE AS OUR CITIES -- THE WESTERN CENTER ON POVERTY BUT ALSO OF THE REALTORS AND FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE BUSINESS AND SO. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TO THINK AND AND AND Q. MY MY GOOD FRIEND IN OUR JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL IS WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS AS WELL. I THANK YOU CENTER ON FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES ON SO ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR IS A SCAR ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND NEEDS TO BE REMOVED -- AS SHOULD NEVER BEEN IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE -- TO CORRECT A VERY TERRIBLE MISTAKE THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA MADE IN ADOPTING OTHERS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS -- WE AS WE ALL KNOW HAVE A TERRIBLE HOUSING CRISIS AND A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING OF ALL TYPES -- INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA I AS WE MOVE TOWARDS TRYING TO CLOSE A THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME SHORTAGE. ON A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT SHORTAGE IS A HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME -- VERY LOW INCOME AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. RESIDENTS -- AN ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR MAKES IT XCEPTIONALLY HARD -- TO GET THIS TYPE OF HOUSING APPROVED HOUSING WITH THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY AND THAT KIND OF HOUSING -- USUALLY REQUIRES A PUBLIC SUBSIDY -- SO WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER TO PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS -- INSTEAD OF PUTTING UP NOT AS BARRIERS BUT HUGE BARRIERS ALL RIGHT NOW THIS KIND OF HOUSING PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED -- LOW INCOME HOUSING IS SINGLED OUT FOR UNIQUE TREATMENT NO OTHER TYPE OF HOUSING IS REQUIRED. TO GO TO THE VOTERS TO BE APPROVED ONLY HOUSING WITH PUBLIC SUBSIDY OFFER OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND THAT SENDS A VERY. POWERFUL NEGATIVE MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT WERE PRIORITIZING IS A STATE -- SO LET'S MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD ALL FORMS OF HOUSING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS -- AND REPEALING ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THANK YOU. YOU SENATORS SINCE YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE. I DID YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR OTHER WITNESSES AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES EACH -- ARAB WELL WITNESSES -- WITH US TODAY ARE OF SYLVIA SO LEASE REPRESENTING CITY OF LOS ANGELES ON YOUR LAWLER FROM THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW AND POVERTY. AND JENNIFER STRUCK FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. MR TURN MEMBERS SYLVIA'S ALICIA ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND ON BEHALF OF CITY OF LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA ONE AM PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR. AS SENATOR ALLEN MENTIONED THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY TWO AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE HOMES FOR EVERYONE HUNDRED EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS AND IN LA COUNTY ALONE WE WOULD NEED TO ADD MORE THAN HALF A MILLION UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET EXISTING DEMAND -- AT THE TIME WHEN THE STATE CALIPHATE IN THE CITY ARE FACING HISTORIC PORTABLE PRIZING IT CRACKED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR JUST ADDS ONE ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO THE CREATION OF THIS MUCH NEEDED HOUSING. IN LOS ANGELES RESIDENTS HAVE APPROVED SIX SUCCESSIVE PROPOSITIONS FROM 1-993-220-0082 ADDRESS ARTICLE THIRTY FOURS REQUIREMENTS AND GAVE THE US CITY AUTHORITY TO FINANCE UP. TO FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS HOWEVER AS NEW FUNDING SOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING COME ONLINE PARTICULARLY STATE SOURCES LIKE PROPS WANTED. TO AND SB TO REVENUES THE CITY WILL BEGIN TO EXHAUST THIS. EXHAUST THIS AUTHORITY IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS. UNLESS ARTICLE THIRTY FOURS REPEAL THE CITY WILL LIKELY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE ARE CONFIDENT THE VOTERS WILL INCREASE THAT AUTHORITY HOWEVER WE FEEL THAT IT IS NEED IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE IN REPEAL THIS LANGUAGE FROM UR CONSTITUTION FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AND ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SCA. ONE THANK YOU YOU MISTER THESE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS RETURN COMMITTEE ON YOU ALL ARE WE HAVE THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AS BOTH AUTHORS HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED CALIFORNIA HAS A TREMENDOUS SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS -- I THINK PEOPLE REACTED WITH SHOCK TODAY WHEN THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS COUNT NUMBERS WERE RELEASED BUT IT WASN'T A SHOCK IT WAS PREDICTABLE BECAUSE WE AREN'T PRODUCING ENOUGH EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSING UNITS. TO HOUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING AND HOMELESSNESS AND WE CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY AND UNFORTUNATELY ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR STANDS IN THE WAY OF BUILDING THOSE UNITS -- IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT PURPORTS TO VALUE DIVERSITY INCLUSION HAVING AN ARTICLE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT OPENLY ALLOWS VOTERS TO CHOOSE TO DISCRIMINATE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IT'S TIME FOR IT TO GO YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER SPECTRUM HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CESSATION OF REALTORS WE ARE ALSO A CODE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; A PROUD CO&lt;/c&gt;</u> SPONSOR OF A CA. ONE I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST POINT OUT THE ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR REQUIRES A DEVELOPMENT CONTAINING LOW RENT WILLING FINANCED IN WHOLE. OR IN PART BY FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT BE APPROVED BY THE LOCAL VOTERS. THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR HAS PROVEN TO BE A MAJOR HURDLE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A SENATOR WINNER POINTED OUT THE ARTICLE SINGLES OUT ONE TYPE OF HOUSING FOR VOTER APPROVAL AND DOES NOT JUST APPLY TO PUBLIC HOUSING BUT CAN ALSO AFFECT FIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS. WHICH OFTEN CONTAIN UNITS PARTIALLY SUBSIDIZED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WEARING A LOCAL POPULAR VOTE TO APPROVE ANY INSTANCE OF GENUINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORKS TO WIDEN ECONOMIC INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA. BALLOT BOX PLANNING GENERALLY AN ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR SPECIFICALLY IS USED AS A POWERFUL NO GROWTH WEAPON FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T WANT DEVELOPMENT. ON AVERAGE COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR ADS ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT TO PEOPLE WITH PRE CONSTRUCTION COSTS. IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID THESE COSTS COSTS THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROVIDES LOW INCOME HOUSING THROUGH A CONVOLUTED SPREAD A FUNDING SOURCES AND MARKET INCENTIVES. CREATIVE AVOIDANCE OF ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR SHOULDN'T BE NECESSARY AND ITS ARCHAIC REQUIREMENTS NEED TO BE REPEALED. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN DETERMINING THE LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF HOUSING IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. FOR DECADES DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM CONSTRUCTING UP ENOUGH UNITS TO KEEP PACE WITH JOB AND POPULATION GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE RESULT RENTS AND HOME PRICES CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED BY THE SENATORS AND ECHO MY COLLEAGUES SCA ONE SIMPLY SEEKS TO REPEAL ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR IN ITS ENTIRETY. LIFTING A MAJOR ROADBLOCK TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ALL OVER THE STATE. WITH THAT SAID WE RESPECT THE REQUESTER AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK YOU MISS BACK ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. COUNTIES IN SUPPORT.

VICTORIA FEARS OF EAST BAY FOR EVERYONE IN SUPPORT. I'VE BEEN WILL BE FROM THE CALIFORNIA RENTERS LEGAL ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION FUND IN SUPPORT. LESLIE CHRIS CELIA WITH SILICON VALLEY AT HOME IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] COME ON SEEING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SENATOR ALLEN WOULD YOU -- WHO WOULD YOU ALLOW US TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVING QUESTIONS WHETHER? I HAVE -- ONE WE HAVE SOME HISTORIAN OF PUTTING THIS ON THE BALLOT -- OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING LAST IN -- NINETY THREE THEY WERE ALL UNSUCCESSFUL WHAT WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PREVIOUS ELECTIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED MORE RECENTLY THAT THERE I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE OPENNESS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE ELECTORATE IS CHANGED -- SOME OF THE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED -- YOU KNOW. WE THINK THAT THE ELECTORATE IS CHANGING THE WAY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME. AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE NUMBER OF ALSO TO SURPRISING RESULTS THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY -- ON ON SAY WHITE BALLOTS THAT HAVE BROKEN. NORMS IN MALLS FROM THE PAST. AT ALL I I I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THE HOUSING -- DISASTER THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW MAYBE IT WASN'T A DISASTER IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IT IS NOW -- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC TO THE POLLING STATEWIDE -- A FIVE OR TEN YEARS AGO HOUSING WAS NOT THE TOP OR EVEN ONE OF THE TOP ISSUE STATEWIDE WAS IN SOME CITIES. BUT NOT STATEWIDE IT IS NOW CONSISTENTLY HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS -- SO I IN THE ELECTORATE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE NOW THAN IT WAS IN. NINETY THREE SO WE WE HAVE SEEN CHANGES -- OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THE SPEAKERS WAS FROM CALIFORNIA EMB. SO WE HAVE PUSH BACK THE OTHER SIDE BUT I'VE BEEN GETTING EMAILS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WONDERING WHAT I'M DOING. TOUCHING ARTICLE THIRTY FOR THE CONSTITUTION I WAS CONFUSED AT FIRST WHEN I STARTED GETTING THE THE EMAILS BUT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FEEL LET. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SELECT THEIR NEIGHBORS AND SO THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE PSYCHE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH -- AT GOING FORWARD SO VOTING FOR THIS -- BILL IS IS JUST ALARM THE VOTERS -- TO WAY IN. THAT'S ABSOLUTE RIGHT IT'LL JUST ALLOWS THE VERGE NGUYEN IN THE OTHER THING I'LL MENTION IS. THIS DOESN'T IMPACT THE RIGHT OF ANY CITY GOVERNMENT. DO YOU STILL MAINTAIN THEIR OWN ZONING LAND USE PLANNING RULES. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING YOU KNOW SUPPORT OF CITIES IN THIS IN THIS CONVERSATION -- SO THE THE CITY GOVERNMENT THAT IS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY WHO ARE POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE PEOPLE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS -- AND SO IN THAT SENSE ARE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY LOCALLY. YES SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT MAKE YOU MIGHT APPROVE OF THE OVERALL. CONCEPT YOU'RE JUST SAYING HEY WE'RE GIVING YOUR SHOT YOU'RE GIVING THE VOTERS OPPORTUNE WAY. RIGHT TO HAVE ANY OTHER FOR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT EITHER OF YOU ARE BOTH OF YOU. WELL I ON IT YEAH I I JUST APPRECIATE THIS THIS CONVERSATION I THINK -- IT'S LONG OVERDUE -- AYE AYE YEAH THAT WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY THIS THIS THIS IS A BARRIER THAT IS ACTUALLY COSTING TAXPAYERS MONEY -- AS WE ARE TRYING TO WHERE WE'RE TRYING WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH WAYS TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND SOME. ARE ARE -- GO FURTHER THAN OTHERS BUT THIS THIS IS A CLEAR BAY AREA RIGHT NOW -- IT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED I'M SO I'M JUST PROUD OF THE COALITION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD A PARTICULARLY -- THANKFUL. APPOINTMENTS ARE SOME OF THE I'M I'M PARTICULAR THANKFUL TO ON THE REALTORS AFTER COMING ON BOARD -- AND WORKING WITH OUR FOLKS IN THE WITH THE ANTI POVERTY COMMUNITY AT IN A IT'S A IT'S A GREAT COALITION WE PULL TOGETHER AND I I REALLY DO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK. GREAT WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE CAN TAKE A VOTE. BUT AS SOON AS WE DO WE WE WILL THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I'LL NOW TURN THE GAVEL BACK OVER TO SENATOR WIENER WHAT -- I WOULD JUST VOTER SOON AS A THIS [inaudible] FIVE YEAH ALMOST. OKAY. THANK YOU -- SEC OKAY -- OKAY I NEXT TO OUR CALL -- ITEM NUMBER TWO AB. ONE FORTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND ALSO ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- TOPIC EXTENSIVELY -- AND I KNOW YOU ARE VERY INVESTED IN THIS TOPIC ON A CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A HOUSING CRISIS. AND IN ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA MEANT MANY OTHER STATES SOLVING HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH BOTTOM LINE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED MANY BEST PRACTICES AND MODELS AND YET IT CONTINUES TO ELUDE US AS FAR AS SOLVING THIS. AB. ONE FORTY THREE WHAT EXPAND EMERGENCY HOUSING TO INCLUDE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. EIGHT THIS WOULD PERTAIN TO ORANGE COUNTY THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTIES AND CITIES -- INCLUDED IN CURRENT LAW THAT HAVE DECLARED A SHELTER CRISIS. AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS A SHELTER CRISIS -- BOTTOM LINE I ORANGE COUNTY. SADLY HAS A MODEL FOR THAT TEN THAT MODEL IS SIMPLY NOT HAVING ENOUGH HOMES TO HELP HELD A HOUSE ARE HOMELESS. WE HAVE A THE INFAMOUS JUDGE JUDGE CARTER WHO IS NOT ONLY SAID THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH BUT THAT HE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH CITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY PROVIDE THIS HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE MODELS IS TO CREATE EMERGENCY SHELTERS AS QUICK AS WE CAN GET THEM UP AND THEN MOVE TOWARDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- WE HAVE SEEN AND TALKED ABOUT THE LARGE INCREASE NOT ONLY IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT LOS ANGELES JUST AN INCREASE IN 16%. SAN FRANCISCO 16%. AND EVEN WORSE IS WHAT'S THAT. A DOING NOT ONLY TO OUR BUSINESSES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO LIVE IN THE HOME BUT TO THE CONDITIONS ON THE OUTSIDE. THE DAY IN LOS ANGELES THERE'S ELECTION AND SOME OF THE LOBBYING FOR OR AGAINST A FUNDING SOURCE HAS CHAU NGUYEN. RATS RUNNING AROUND. THE LA CITY HALL IN OTHER PARTS IT BILL BEING -- BLAMED ON HOMELESSNESS BUT SIMPLY THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING OUT -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE ADDING TO ALL TYPES OF HEALTH ISSUES -- WHETHER IT BE OUTBREAKS WHETHER IT BE TYPHUS WHETHER IT BE HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT WE REALLY DID NOT THINK WE'D HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT IN THIS DAY AND TIME. SO WE NEED MANY MANY STRATEGIES ARE BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM AB FORTY ONE FORTY THREE WHAT IT A CREATE FLEXIBILITY TO EXPEDITE THE CREATION OF SHELTERS. AND AGAIN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- IT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MUST DO IS GET THE SHELTERS UP THE JUDGE NOW HAS MET WITH. EACH CITY ARE IN ORANGE COUNTY TO ASK THEM TO WORK TOWARDS A PLAN -- IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING TOWARDS THE PLAN HE WILL NOT BE -- WORKING -- TO HE WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO CAMP AND PARKS AND OTHER AREAS AND LIST THE CITIES ARE MOVING TOWARDS A HOMELESS PLAN. A AND HE'S MADE MANY -- CONDITIONS IN SETTLEMENTS WITH CITIES -- AND I DO THINK THE ENTIRE STATE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TOUGH WHAT OUR JUDGES DO IT NOW I KNOW I HAVE MY FRIEND HERE FROM ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T KNOW IF HE AGREES WITH THAT. BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO DO -- SO WITH THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING -- THE COUNTIES OR CITIES ORDINANCES TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS ARE NOT ONLY FOR FIELD BUT THAT THEY ARE OVERSEEN. EACH A COMMUNITY OPERATING UNDER THE BILL MUST REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE -- AND TODAY I HAVE NICOLE WARD A MAN ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND REAGAN AND INJURE. WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOUSE SCENE AND SAN JOSE? NICOLE MORTAL MAN ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE FORTY THREE THIS MEASURE WOULD EXPEDITE THE PROVISION OF SHELTER FOR THE COUNTIES AND SHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION. HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT ISSUES FACING THE COUNTY. IN JANUARY DURING THE COUNTY IS. HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT IT SHOWED AN INCREASE OF 43% IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION TO ALMOST. THE COUNTY HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF CARE. INCREASING THAT NUMBER BY SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AB ONE FORTY THREE WOULD PERMIT THE COUNTY GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PROVISION OF SHELTER WHILE REQUIRING THE COUNTY TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. BALANCING BOTH LOCAL AND STATE GOALS. THEREFORE THE COUNTY URGES AN AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE FORTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON REAGAN HENNINGER WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE'S HOUSING DEPARTMENT THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. FOR THIS BILL AND TO USE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON. SAN JOSE HAS OVER SIX THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE IN OUR CITY. WE KNOW THE ANSWER IS HOUSING. WE HAVE OVER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOMES CURRENTLY IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE. OVER 90% OF THOSE WE HOUSE REMAIN STABLE THE HOUSE. BUT THERE'S A CRISIS IN THE STREETS RIGHT NOW. FOR EVERYONE PERSON THAT WE STABLE THE HOUSE IN OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE. THREE MORE FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS. SHELTERS AND OTHER INTERIM HOUSING OPTIONS ALLOW US TO PROVIDE PEOPLE SAFETY. RESPITE FROM THE ELEMENTS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES. IN SAN JOSE THIS SUMMER WILL OPEN TO BRIDGE HOUSING COMMUNITIES OR TINY HOME COMMUNITIES. WE'RE CURRENTLY CITING OUR FIRST NAVIGATION CENTER. OR SHELTER FOR ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE. AB ONE FORTY THREE WILL HELP US MOVE QUICKLY. AND SERVE THOSE WHO ARE LIVING AN UNIMAGINABLE CONDITIONS OUTSIDE. WE THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL.

CASING NON WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CALLERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL THIS. YES SENATOR DRAW SO. I VERY MUCH -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. A FEW QUESTIONS -- YOU KNOW WHAT SOMETIMES THE COMES TO MIND WHEN IT SAYS WE'RE GONNA SUSPEND LOCAL HOUSING HEALTH. AND SAFETY STANDARDS OF WERE PUBLIC FACILITIES IT WAS A YOU KNOW KIND OF BRINGS TO MIND. WHERE THE DANGERS OF THE POTENTIAL DANGERS AND -- I COULD SEE. A BUILDING. FACILITIES A PLACES THAT. MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUSLY IS FANCY -- AS YOU KNOW BIG SINGLE FAMILY HOME. ON THE OTHER HAND I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE YOU. DRAW THE LINE AS FAR AS WITH MINIMALLY NEEDED TO SHELTER ARE HOMELESS. AND THEN WORK WHERE IS IT NOW UNSAFE SO. IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION BROADLY SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION. AND RELATED TO THAT IS. WILL THEY BE CONSIDERED SUBSTANDARD STRUCTURES. AND IF SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE STRUCTURES. AT A POINT. WHEN? WE MAY NOT NEED THE THE SAME KIND OF FACILITY OF THAT SAME KIND OF HOUSING SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. THANK. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS ANOTHER VERY GOOD QUESTIONS UP FIRST DOES THIS IS NOT A MANDATE WHICH MEANS THAT. THE LOCAL CITIES WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES CAN STILL MAKE THE DECISION IF THAT'S THE ROUTE THEY WANT TO GO IN ORDER. TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN -- QUITE A BIT OF THE FUNDING COMING DOWN FROM THE STATE. HE FUNDS AND SO FORTH A CITY WOULD HAVE TO DECLARE A SHELTER CRISIS OR EMERGENCY UP TO GET THOSE CITY SO SOME ARE ALREADY DOING THAT EVEN WITHOUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT AS FAR AS BUILDING THE HOUSING -- WE WOULD MAKE SURE -- THAT THIS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS ARE NOT DIMINISHED IT'S JUST. THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME TYPES OF STREAMLINING THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO MOVE FASTER AS WE KNOW EVEN A REGULAR -- TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT CAN SOMETIMES TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS FROM GOING FROM -- NOT ONLY PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOPMENT AND THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES SO THIS WOULD HOPEFULLY BE MUCH QUICKER OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T REALLY BE OF OUR OUR GOAL IS TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE WITHIN. TWO TO THREE YEARS WELL THE FUNDING IS THERE AS FAR AS THE SHELTERS EMERGENCY SHELTERS -- MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES WOULD BE BUILT ON CITY PROPERTY AS WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PROPERTY IS ALREADY OWNED BY THE CITY AND THEY'RE BUILDING. WHAT WOULD BE MORE TEMPORARY UP KIND OF LIKE OF? THE MODULAR BUILDINGS I'M TRYING TO THINK OF THE TYPE OF BUILDINGS THEY BRING ON TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHEN THEY NEED ADDITIONAL THAT THE PRE FAB TYPE OF BUILDINGS. SO THEY ALREADY HAVE SAFETY CODES AND SO FORTH. AS FAR AS THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT WOULD DEFINITELY GO THROUGH THE CODES THAT THE CITIES HAVE IN PLACE -- AND THOSE WOULD BE PERMANENT -- SO I THINK THE THE GOING AROUND SEEK WOODS NOT TO GO AROUND IT IT'S TO MAKE SURE THE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE STILL THERE BUT TO MOVE IT FORWARD IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. NOT SURE IF THAT ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS. AND ALSO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE OF THE OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OVERSIGHT BY THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SO THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE ON WATCH TO MAKE SURE. NOT JUST THROWING UP IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOME TYPE OF UP VERY MINIMAL HOUSING WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT TENS ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. PLEASE YES SORRY CENTER MORE LIKE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FOR PROVISION ANYTHING WRONG. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE TIP HUSTLER -- THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO TO COUNTY SAN AND ONE CITY AND ONE COUNTY AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY ISN'T THE BILL -- STATE LEVEL TO IT YEAH. THAT THAT'S THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK AT MY NOTES FOR THAT ONE OF BECAUSE I WAS. IT'S SO SPECIFIC. AND I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE WERE JUST GONNA START SMALL AND WE DID ACTUALLY WHEN THE BILL CAME OUT WE WERE ASKED BY THE CITIES MENTIONED IF THEY COULD PARTICIPATE. BUT WE JUST PRETTY MUCH STARTED WITH ORANGE COUNTY AS THAT'S THE COUNTY I REPRESENT AND THEN -- SAN JOSE AND ALAMEDA ASKED TO JOIN IN. AND WE SAID YES. AND THEN WHEN THE CITY DECLARES A SHELTER CRISIS IS THAT JUST -- A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IT'S A VOTE BY THE INDIVIDUAL CITY. AND THE COUNTY COULD A DECLARE -- COUNTY CRISIS BUT I BELIEVE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS IN BUT IT IN A PARTICULAR CITY THE CITY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO DECLARE THE CRISIS AS WELL. AND THE CITY YOU MEAN THAT THE CITY COUNCIL YES. THANK YOU MISTER JR THANK YOU. OKAY I SEE NO OTHER COMMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. AND AS SOON AS WE DO WE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- SO WITHOUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO FLOWS. I WILL I JUST AGAIN SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOMELESSNESS -- IN OTHER AREAS AS LIFE MOVE FORWARD SEVERAL BILLS UNDER THIS TOPIC THIS YEAR BUT UP PERSONALLY. LIKE MANY FAMILIES I'VE SEEN A FAMILY MEMBER STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND IN ORANGE COUNTY JUST IN THIS LAST YEAR -- WE HAVE LOST OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED ON ORANGE COUNTY SEAT STREETS JUST THIS LAST YEAR. AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN THAT BUT WITH THE JUDGE. CARTER DAVID CARTER SO INVOLVED HE ACTUALLY. PULLED THE AUTOPSY. RECORDS AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM TO FIND OUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON IN ADDITION TO THEM NOT HAVING SHELTER. AND MANY OF THEM DIED FROM PNEUMONIA. THAT TYPE OF JUST GETTING SICK AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET IT RECOVER AND IF YOU IMAGINE BEING OUT IN THE STREETS IN YOUR SEC. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET SICKER AND THAT ALSO PASS ON THESE OTHER ISSUES AND MY BROTHER WAS ONE OF THOSE. SO THAT'S WHY BRING THIS BILL FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- SO WE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AS SOON AS WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU RIGHT. NEXT WE WILL GO -- TO WE HAVE -- ONE TWO MORE NON CONSENT ITEMS ANNEXES SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN -- AND THAT IS AB [inaudible] SIX SEVENTY WELCOME. SO -- SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE BILL -- I AM A BIG SUPPORTER OF EIGHTY USES ONE OF OUR IMPORTANT SOLUTIONS. TO HELP WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS BRINGING PEOPLE IN A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS -- WORKING VERY MUCH WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS AND ALSO OF COURSE EXPANDING LOCAL -- PROPERTY RIGHTS BY ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO BUILDING EIGHTY YOU IF THEY SO CHOOSE -- UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA -- H. O. WAYS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS FOR SOME REASON HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWING CHARTER CITIES TO DO. AND THEY'VE THROUGH THE REGULATIONS COME BLOCK THE ABILITY OF A HOMEOWNER TO DO AN EIGHTY YOU IF THEY WANT -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS EVER ANTICIPATED WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED WOULD BE IT AS IT MAY -- IT'S REALLY A LOOPHOLE -- SO -- THERE IS OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND IT'S ALWAYS IN THE STATE THAT MAKE UP. TO UP TO ABOUT SIX MILLION TOTAL HOUSING UNITS SO THIS BILL WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE THE THE M. H. ALWAYS HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME STATE LAWS CITIES IN CHARTER CITIES. AND CAMP PUT ON REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS ON EIGHTY USE ALTHOUGH WE DO ALLOW THEM STILL THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN IMPACT WITH DESIGN -- SETBACKS THAT SORT OF THING SO THEY CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT CONFORMS TO THEIR DESIGN STANDARDS AND THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TRUMP -- INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS ABILITY TO PUT AN EIGHTY YOU IN FOR THEIR FOR THEIR PARENTS OR THEIR CHILDREN OR TO RENT OUT IF THEY WISH. SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD REQUEST FULLY QUESTION I VOTED IN WITH ME HERE TODAY. IS -- DAVID JONES FROM THIS TODAY REPRESENTING THE CITY OF TRUCKEE COUNTY ALL RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS REPRESENT THE CITY OF GLENDALE THROUGH VERY GOOD LIKE I THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE. FOR A GOOD ANALYSIS -- THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME AS NOTED THIS IS BEEN DONE BEFORE IT WITH A TWO WAYS THE LEGISLATION IS PASSED WISDOM DECIDED THAT SOLAR -- SATELLITE DISHES EVEY CHARGING STATIONS AND A WATER CONSERVATION WERE THINGS THAT WAS WORTHY OFHAVING THE AGE WHERE RULES PREEMPTED SO WE THINK THIS FALLS IN THE CATEGORY WITH. THE EARLIER TESTIMONY THE CRISIS OF HOUSING -- AND TYPICALLY FOR LOW HOUSING KIND OF TRICKY A HAS HAD. A DELUGE OF FIGHT OF HOUSING LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITY THERE I DON'T KNOW HOW FAMILIAR YOU ARE WITH IT BUT IT'S FOUR TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM RENO RENO USED TO BE THERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SAFETY NET. WITH AMAZON AND TEST LOW BUILDING GIANT PLANTS THERE THEREFORE DOUBLE HOUSING SAFETY VALVE HAS HAS ELIMINATED SO THEIR CRUNCH FOR WORKFORCE HOUSING IN THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE HAS DISAPPEARED. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST H. AWAYS IN THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE WITHIN OUR TOWN LIMITS. A SINGLE FAMILY SIX THOUSAND VACATION HOMES THOSE OWNERS ARE CLAMORING FOR THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN H. AWAY MOST OF THEM LIVE IN THE BAY AREA THEY ARE NOT RESIDENTS TREKKIE. BUT THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIVING ON THEIR PROPERTY THAT CAN WATCH OUT FOR THE PROPERTY WHEN THEY'RE GONE FOR THE TWO WEEKS SHOVEL THEIR DRIVEWAY CAN SNOW SEASON. AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS THING THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET THAT DON'T LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE ABLE TO BUILD THEIR EIGHT EIGHTY USE THERE SO. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK IT'S REX THE PROPER BALANCE OF RESPECTING AS MUCH AS WE CAN WE DON'T GET INTRUSIVE INTO THE AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED. IF IT'S A SENIOR -- H. AWAY WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AN ABILITY TO HAVE KIDS IT'S A SPANISH STYLE H. AWAY. THE DESIGN HAS TO BE MEET WITH THE H. WAY REQUIREMENTS SO WE'VE TRIED TO BE AS RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE TO THE H. AWAY RULES. AND SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR NAVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. FAMOUS CHAIRMAN KEYS DONE HERE BEHALF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE LIKE TO THINK THE OFFERING JUST REITERATE MISTER JONES I COMMON SO YOU AS WE FACE THIS HOUSING CRISIS WHEN HE'D BE LOOKING AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL MY REFERRALS HAVE GONE THIS YEAR BUT THE SECOND TIME. SO AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY WOULD EXTEND THE DEADLINE -- FOR SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION GOVERNMENTS TO FINALIZE A NEW REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN BY TWO YEARS HISTORICALLY SANDBAG HAS BEEN CRITICIZED APPROPRIATELY FOR NOT PRIORITIZING INVESTING ENOUGH PUBLIC TRANSIT BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE AGENCY HAS GONE THROUGH DRAMATIC CHANGE LARGELY THROUGH LEGISLATION WE ARE AND ABLE -- TO AND CHANGE THE DIRECTION AND LEADERSHIP OF SANDBAGS. WHEN US AND DAD BEGAN TO WORK ON UPDATE RTP FOR TWENTY NINETEEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT CONCEPTS WOULDN'T MEET THE 19% TARGET -- THAT'S A TARGET THAT THEY HAD THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD FINALIZE NEW GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS FOR LOCAL AGENCIES I'M FROM AND EVEN A MEANINGFUL CHANGE HAS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF RECENT SCANDAL AND RESTRUCTURING OF THE BOARD WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET WHAT IT WOULD BE A FALSE -- PLAN AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR TWO YEAR EXTENSION IN ORDER TO PUT FORWARD A PLAN THAT WILL ACTUALLY MEET THOSE GOALS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. HI I GET AFTERNOON ROBIN WAGNER WITH THE SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORTER AND PROUD SPONSORSHIP OF ASSEMBLY BILL -- SEVENTEEN THIRTY EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SANTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS COMPRISED OF EACH OF THE LOCAL CITIES AND THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED AN ACTION PLAN. TO TAKE THE TIME THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL SAN DIEGANS A TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT NOT ONLY MEETS BUT EXCEEDS OUR STATE CLIMATE GOALS. AND REALLY CREATES TRUE MOBILITY TRACES THAT HELPS ALL PEOPLE GET WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WHEN THEY WANT TO GO AND HOW THEY WANT TO GO. IN ORDER TO DO THIS SO IN TO DO IT RIGHT WE NEED MORE TIME AND SO SOME LEGAL SEVENTEEN THIRTY GIVES US AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS TO CREATE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THAT TRULY WILL TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT PEOPLE AND GOODS MOVED THROUGHOUT THE REGION IT ALSO PRESERVES OUR CURRENT LENA AND HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE TIME LINES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT WE NEED. TO ADDRESS THOSE URGENT NEEDS THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT THIS COMMITTEE IS SO -- URGENTLY FOCUSED ON SO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE CORNY TO WITH ALL OF OUR JURISDICTIONS WE ENJOY A STRONG SUPPORT FROM ACROSS THE REGION VERY STAKEHOLDERS -- AND WE'RE VERY VERY THANKFUL THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS AGREED TO RUN THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF US THAT WE CAN TAKE THE TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT. WE RESPECT YOUR QUESTION I FELT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO -- MAYOR KEVIN FAULCONER AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE EMBARKED UPON A AN AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AS WELL AS HOUSING INITIATIVES IN RECENT YEARS -- AND WE SEE STAND I GUESS OUR PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS AND AND IT TOO TO REFORM STAND ACT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP IS STRONG SO THAT WE CAN MEET THESE AGGRESSIVE GOALS THAT WE'VE PLACED. UPON OURSELVES -- WE THINK HURRIEDLY PUTTING TOGETHER A A PLAN OF THE SCS IN RTP SIMPLY TO MEET -- THE DEADLINE WON'T SERVE ANYBODY'S PURPOSES WHILE TAKING AN EXTRA TWO YEARS TO GET THE PLAN DONE PROPERLY -- IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- AND WE WE DO SUPPORT THE MEASURE WERE A SPONSOR A CO SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE WITH OUR PARTNERS AND SANDBAG ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. IN BILL HIGGINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS AND I'M HERE TO PERHAPS OFFER A STATEWIDE -- PERSPECTIVE MY BOARD JUST TOOK A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL ON WEDNESDAY WHICH IS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE A LETTER IN FRONT OF YOU. RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD SAY JUST GENERALLY ABOUT THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY. IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMMUNITY VISIONING DOCUMENT. N. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VISION THE OPT OUT BY END. AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE SPONSORS AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THIS IS TO GIVE THE COMMUNITY A CHANCE TO BUILD A NEW VISION FOR THE REGION. AND THAT TAKES TIME BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO IT FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT. HAVE TO DEVELOP A VISION INTEGRATE YOUR SEQUEL -- RUN YOUR TRAVEL MODELS DO YOUR SEE I'M SORRY TO INTEGRATE YOUR ARENA AND THEN DO YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND THAT ALL TAKES TIME IN FACT -- A TYPICAL REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN FROM START TO FINISH TAKES ALMOST FOUR YEARS WE WE WE ADOPT ONE AND THEN. THE PLANNERS GOING CELEBRATE FOR A WEEKEND AND THEN THEY COME BACK ON MONDAY WORK ON THE NEXT. ONE AND SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO THIS IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME AND GET IT DONE IT TO THE FINISH SIGNED AND AND TO HAVE A VISION THAT THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. ULTIMATELY ACHIEVES CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. GREAT IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. JOHNSON CLAIMED AFTER THE CITY EVEN SENATORS THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT. CATHERINE OCCURRED ON ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF CARLSBAD IN SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. OKAY THING NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. FEMALE WILL BRING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES I SENATOR CABALLERO AND THEN CENTER LIKE HUSKY. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING -- THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER WORK AT MAKING SOME CHANGES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL I THINK IT'S SOME IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- THOSE CHANGES ARE GONNA. BE OOD FOR THE COMMUNITY I JUST HAVE A QUESTION THIS IS FAIRLY UNUSUAL IN TERMS OF A WAY TO DO BUSINESS -- IS THERE ANY OTHER COUNTY THAT HAS -- THIS KIND OF ISSUE. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF I WOULD SAY THAT -- SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION THERE'S NO EASY PATHWAY TO THE NEXT ROUND OF TARGETS. SENDEK SITUATION IS UNIQUE BUT I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE AMONG THE OTHER LARGE NPOS THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. IS ALSO STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR TARGET A 19% AND ARE SEEKING SOME NEW BUDGET INVESTMENTS THAT THEY THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU. FOR SO THE THIRD DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO GET TO WHAT THAT FIX THE IS. BUT THE ROAD THE THE ROAD TO ACHIEVING MORE MORE REDUCTIONS WITH EACH PERCENTAGE INCREASE IT GETS TOUGHER AND TOUGHER BECAUSE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT IS GONE. SO -- I THINK I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY GOOD PILOT IS HOW I KIND OF THINK ABOUT IT TO SEE YOU B	C IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO BACK AND RETOOL. I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE VISION IN THAT THEY COME BACK WITH -- GOING TO PUSH US ALL IN A POLICY STANDPOINT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN OUR OUR WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET THERE TO MEET THE GOAL. SO THAT'S AND IF I CAN -- SENATOR YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN I DID THE BILL BEFORE IN FACT A LOT OF YOU I HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH -- PROBABLY AT THE TIME I THINK ON LOCAL GOV -- IT WAS UNUSUAL WHAT WE DID THEN AND WE UP ENDED THE ENTIRE AGENCY IN YOU IT IS -- ALMOST LIKE NIGHT AND DAY AND SO WHAT I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE THIS KIND OF TOTAL REORGANIZATION AND AN SOMETHING THAT IN IT OUT REALLY GOOD FOR ENTIRE REGION -- I WOULD ARGUE. DEFINITELY THE PART THAT I LIVE IN -- ENDED UP HAVING NEW LEADERSHIP HAVING NEW VISION INCLUDING THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO HADN'T BEEN IN SOME OF THE REGIONAL PLANNING WE WE COULD THEY COULD DO A PLAN IT WON'T MEET ITS GOALS. IT THEY'LL KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A GOOD PLAN THEY'LL GET SUED -- AND WILL BE IN COURT AND THEY'LL HAVE TO GO MAKE A NEW PLAN I I THINK IT'S A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN EVEN. ALL SIDES OF KIND OF THE DEBATE ON WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH WITH PUBLIC TRANSIT AND WITH INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES WERE NOT. MONOLITHIC IN OUR COUNTY ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD GO BUT DESPITE THAT EVERYBODY WHETHER IT'S THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY PEOPLE WHO WANT MORE ROADS PEOPLE WHO WANT MORE TRANSIT ARE ALL ON BOARD WITH THIS -- APPROACH BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER HAD COMMUNITY INPUT LIKE THAT SO WE'VE NEVER HAD THE ABILITY SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S UNUSUAL -- AND AND I KNOWS DIFFERENT COUNTIES PROBABLY ARE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WE WE TRULY BECAUSE OF OF SCANDALS IN BECAUSE OF A A VOTING STRUCTURE THAT REALLY LEFT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE OUT OF THE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. THE PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT FOR DECADES -- WERE IN A UNIQUE POSITION AND I KNOW. IT'S KIND OF FUNNY TO LOOK AT THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW -- CENTER WOULD HOUSE HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY BILL AND EIGHT I CAN'T ON THIS ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT I KNOW I WORKED REALLY HARD WITH -- CENTER MCGUIRE -- I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT WE WERE DOING LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM HERE AND SO WE WE I HAD SO MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS BUT NOW WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE IN A MUCH BETTER-SPOT I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD IT. NOT EVERYBODY MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT. DEATH THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY WOULD AGREE TO THAT -- AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THIS -- TRANSPORTATION PLAN RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THE REASON FOR THE QUESTION IS THAT -- MANY TIMES WE DO ONE OFF BILLS. AND AND THERE AND THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE AFTERWARDS THAT ARE SAYING WORK WE'RE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND SO I WANT TO BE FAIR. IN THIS PROCESS -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GO BACK AND RETOOL. THE DATES. AND HOW WE SET UP THE OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THERE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE'VE SET THESE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. AND WE SAID EVERYBODY HAS TO ACHIEVE THEM. AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES YOU WON'T GET TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS IF YOU'RE NOT ARE YOU. OR YOUR AIR BOARD IS NOT GOING TO GET THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. AND AND MY CONCERN AND I'M GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT IF YOU'VE DONE. GOOD WORK ON IT BUT BUT IN REALITY WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING AN OLD SECRET DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE APPLICABLE. TO THE NEW WHATEVER IS GOING TO BE AND AND SO IT'S SIXTY CA EXEMPTION RIGHT -- AND I AND I IT AND IT WE JUST NEED TO ASK WE NEED TO CALL THIS OUT AND SAY MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS IF WE HAVE OTHER COUNTIES THAT MIGHT BE. IN THE IN A VERY SIMILAR POSITION -- MAYBE AT JUST THE DATES. FOR WHICH ON REPORTER DO. AND THE CYCLES -- IS SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DOING A ONE OFF FOR SOMEBODY BUT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY. AND WILL SAY DURING THIS DURING THIS NEXT CYCLE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MESS AROUND WITH ALL THE ANY OF THE TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS. IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT GOING. TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE WE'RE GONNA LET BUT EVERYBODY'S IN THE SAME POSITION BECAUSE WE'VE ADJUSTED THE CYCLE THAT'S THAT JUST MY CONCERN BECAUSE WHEN I WENT. AS I WENT THROUGH IT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT. BACKWARDS -- WERE USING A SECRET DOCUMENT TO SATISFY THE FEDS AND THEN AND THEN WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT -- THE REAL PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE -- JUST TAKE CARE OF THEM THIS ISN'T REALLY REAL BUT BUT IN REALITY -- THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES AND SO ANYWAY I THAT JUST MIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS AND I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT AFFECTING MORE THAN JUST ONE COUNTY. BUT I I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HAD I THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND MORE COUNTIES ARE IN THE SAME POSITION [inaudible] ENTER ACOSTA. WITH A BICYCLE. QUESTIONS FOR EQ MY AS A PLANNING PROCESS. AND I GUESS I'M ASKING FOR BEST PRACTICES DO WE THINK THAT BY THIS EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME TO DO THE MULTI MODAL PLANNING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES IN THAT. THE SAN DIEGO AREA IS GONNA BE ON TARGET TO DO TAKE TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TARGETS BUT ALSO WE HAVE TARGETS FOR TWENTY FORTY SO SO THAT'S MY QUESTION IS THIS IS A PLANNING INSTRUMENT OKAY WE REALIZE WERE OFF COURSE. CAN WE ADJUSTED NOW AND THEN GIVEN THE POWERS THAT BE IN THE NEXT. FEDERATION IS GOING TO BE ON TARGET I THINK -- WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS OUR OUR PLANS ARE NOW TAKE SEE THOSE TARGETS -- AND SO. WE'VE REALLY. I CAN'T POSSIBLY DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW DIFFERENT OF AN AGENCY WE HAVE TODAY THAN WE EVEN HAD. YOU KNOW A YEAR AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO AND SO -- IT IS AT OUR IT IS THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE SEA AND DAD BOARD TO EXCEED THOSE TARGETS WITH COMMUNITY INPUT THAT MAKES SENSE SO YEAH I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OKAY -- THAT'S A MOVE THE BILL A MOVE BY CENTER CABALLERO AND US SOME ROAD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND SENATE MCGUIRE THE DO YOU ORDER CENTER UMBER GET THEM ACQUIRE AWARD FOR TODAY NO I BELIEVE IT'S AYE NAMED AFTER CAR LARA AND I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO CENTER NUMBER TODAY -- SO CONGRATULATIONS CENTER I'M VERY.
