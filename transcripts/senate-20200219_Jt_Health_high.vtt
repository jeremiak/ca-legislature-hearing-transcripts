THAT I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.045
REMARKS THAT- I THINK WHAT ARE

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:22.480
THE BENEFITS OF BASIC HEALTH

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:25.016
CARE SERVICES USING BROAD

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:28.252
CATEGORIES IS THAT- IT THE

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.454
SERVER IS THE CHOIR TO UP BY

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:31.923
PLANTS BECAUSE IT DOES EVEN ALL

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:35.126
OVER TIME AND SO ONE OF THE ONE

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:37.061
OF THE TH AND SORT OF DRAWBACKS

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:39.764
OF BEING VERY PRESCRIPTIVE WITH

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.566
RESPECT TO CERTAIN STACK. THAT

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:44.569
I. DIFFICULT ARE COVERED. IN IT

00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.003
CAN IT CAN SOMETIMES BACKFIRE

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.506
BECAUSE AS MEDICINE IS ALWAYS

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:51.108
MOVING FORWARD RIGHT AND SO WE

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.277
WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.313
COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS MOVE WITH

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.516
THOSE AND FOR THE MOST PLANT

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.650
PART THE HEALTH PLANS ARE

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:02.820
GENERALLY OUT WITHOUT. BEING I

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:14.899
HELPFUL IN THAT WAY. HE

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.801
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES-

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:18.869
BECAUSE I THOUGHT AS I THE ONE

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.104
OF THE COMMENTS I HEARD WAS

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.708

WHAT OTHER STATES WOULD MEAN

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.949
AND DRAW FROM THAT OR DID I

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:35.186
SENATE STAND. THE STATE DOES

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:38.456
NOT HAVE TO BUT A STATE CAN AND

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:41.559

LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:49.520
ISSUE OF- THAT YOU RAISE THAT

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.555
IF YOU HAVE A- YOU KNOW A

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:54.592
MANDATE. THAT IT CAN BACKFIRE-

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:57.528
THE SO. AND SO I'M JUST

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:58.863
THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.332
MANDATES THAT WE'VE PASSED BOTH

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:04.034
PRE AND POST A CLL KNOWS ME

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:08.339
POST CA- BUT- SO WILL ACTUALLY

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.908
MONTHS I'M A PEDIATRICIAN- WE-

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.676
I WORKED WITH MY PREDECESSOR

THAT TEMAS AND ASSEMBLY- STAR

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.380
SIGN BURKE- WE MANDATED

RIGHT- TO HEALTH PLANS IN THE

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.486
REASON THAT INVOLVED WAS

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:25.756
BECAUSE- ESSENTIALLY- NO IT

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.725
FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP AND THEY

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.227
SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT HE GETS

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.862
THROUGH THE SCHOOL. I WOULD

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.097
SHOULD OFTEN YES AND WE

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:33.731
FAMILIES WERE STUCK WITH

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:34.832
SCHOOLS ONE THOUGH TO HEALTH

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.767

SO- AND SO BECAUSE ID A THE

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:43.574
SCHOOL HAS TO TAKE CARE OF IT

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.675
SO WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:46.577
OF IT AND- I GUESS THE QUESTION

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:50.614
I HAVE THEN IS THAT- SO WELL

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:51.682
FIRST OF ALL CAN YOU GIVE ME AN

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.751
EXAMPLE. IT WAS PASSED SEVERAL

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.920
MANDATES THE SAMPLE HOW ANY

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:58.189
SPECIFIC DEAL WITH JUST ONE OF

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.590
THE MANDATES WHERE THIS MIGHT

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:02.092
IT BACKFIRED- WHERE- A SPECIFIC

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.460
END DATE BECAUSE TUESDAY FIX

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:06.397
THEN OUT TO. BLESS YOU KNOW OF

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:08.132
PEOPLE NOW PATIENTS HAVING AN

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:08.866
ABILITY AT THE SERVICES THAT

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.734
THEY NEED SO YOU BROUGHT THAT

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:11.635
UP AS AN ISSUE I'M NOT SAYING I

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.070
DISAGREE WITH THAT NECESSARILY

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.072
BUT- IT'S I THINK IT MIGHT BE

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.273
HELPFUL THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A-

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.009
FORCED TO. PICK ONE AND GIVE US

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:19.543
AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS MIGHT

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.880
HAPPEN. WELL I THINK- I DON'T

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.748
KNOW I'M NOT SO I THINK IT'S AN

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:28.786
ISSUE CAME UP. TWO YEARS BACK

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:29.386
HAVING TO DO WITH D.

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:30.654
MAMMOGRAPHY AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.022
THAT WAS COVERED. BECAUSE

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:34.491
MAMMOGRAMS WERE COVERED- BUT

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.760
DID THREE D. MAMMOGRAPHY SO I

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:39.463
THINK REALLY THE- WHAT IS I

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.397
DON'T KNOW THAT IT SO MUCH

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:42.366
BACKFIRED AS MUCH AS HAVING THE

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.001
REQUIREMENT TO COVER BASIC

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:47.104
HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS. CAN

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.772
SOMETIMES BE RELIED ON BECAUSE

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.741
OF THE BROAD SCOPE BECAUSE

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:52.843
MAYBE THAT THE MANDATE IS

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.778
SOMEWHAT- NEED. IN THE WAY THAT

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.713
IT'S HER MIGHT NOT COVER

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:58.048
ADVANCEMENT SO. IT WOULDN'T

00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:00.050
NECESSARILY MAYBE WE- END UP

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.085
WITH SOMETHING NOT BEING

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.620
COVERED SO MUCH AS THAT FACT

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.154
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:05.155
COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OF BASIC

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.124
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THAT

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.593
LARGER CATEGORY SORT OF AND

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.995
SERVES AS A BACKSTOPS TO MAKE

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:11.795
SURE THAT WE WOULD WANT

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.697
SOMETHING THAT AS SITES MOVE

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:14.999
FORWARD IN IS MEDICALLY

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.133
NECESSARY FOR THAT PATIENT THAT

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.967
THAT WOULD BE COVERED. I CAN'T

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:20.004
THINK OF ANY SPECIFIC IS GET UP

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.838
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OR

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.306
SOMETHING CHRISLEY WANTING

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:25.142
CAUGHT. SO I MEAN THAT THAT

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.410
EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLES ACTUALLY

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:27.344
HE'S COVERED PERSPECTIVE

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:30.681
KNOWLEDGE YEAH A TECHNOLOGY

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:35.185
THAT REALLY NAY THAT MAY BE YOU

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:40.724
THIS. LEE AT THE OVER NINE MAY

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.793
I. THERE'S OTHER TECHNIQUES

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.128
STAFF NOW A SUBSEQUENT SIX THAT

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.529
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THAT'S YEAH

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.664
ALL RIGHT SO AND I KNOW OTHER I

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.332
THAT THAT DON'T THINK IT

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.466
HAPPENED HERE CAL. FOR PEER TO

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:53.070
TIME DOES SOME HOPE THAT TOTAL

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:54.471
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS WOULD

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.540
BE A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:59.643
BREAST CANCER AND SO DOES A LOT

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.546
OF TERROR IN THE COMMUNITY TO

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:04.348
HAVE THE PROPER PROCEDURE TO

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.350
TURN IT DOWN AS EXPERIMENTAL TO

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.920
REQUIRE THAT. OVER TIME IT'S

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.789
COVERED IT WAS UP TO GO IF IT

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:16.226
MEANT. VALUE HAPPENED. THE WAY

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.161
INSTEAD IN CERTAIN. THAT THAT

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.529
WAS COVERED SO I DIRECT A

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.264
SOMETHING'S WHEN YOU SPECIFY IT

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.031
TO A PARTICULAR FORM OF

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:26.236
TECHNOLOGY VERSUS A- THAT THAT.

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.471
THERE'S A CHALLENGE THERE BUT-

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.906
BUT I GUESS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:32.176
GOING BACK TO THE AST EXAMPLE.

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:34.178
AND IT'S COMES DOWN TO WELL

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.713
OKAY SEE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.548
HAVE WE HAVE BROAD CATEGORIES

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.116
RIGT AND I GET THINGS ARE

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:42.086
DYNAMIC. THIS THE TERMINATION

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.187
THEN DOES IT FIT INTO THAT

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:47.458
BROAD CATEGORY OR NOT RIGHT SO

BROAD CATEGORY OR NOT. FOR THE

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.807
TERMS OF THE MEDICAL NECESSITY

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.809
PIECE OKAY OKAY OKAY SO I THINK

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.978
I UNDERSTAND ADDRESS KING SO- I

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.047
THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE MAT

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.615
THE SUBSIDY DETERMINATION

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:47.117
THAT'S DONE BY INDEPENDENT

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.353
CLINICIAN OKAY. I DON'T KNOW

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.221
THAT WE'RE GIVING GUIDELINES TO

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.656
PHYSICIANS ABOUT HOW THEY

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:53.557
SHOULD DETERMINE MEDICAL

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.526
NECESSITY ARE NOT THAT THE

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:56.860
JUDGEMENT OF THAT SO THERE'S NO

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:59.129
GUIDELINES RIGHT AYE AYE YEAH I

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.864
CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING- THEN.

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:03.367
DOWN TO THE AST THING PRIOR TO

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.202
ACTUALLY PASSING THE LAW THEN

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:08.038
HOW WAS THAT DECISION THEN HOW

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.506
IS THAT. BUT CAME TO THE A. B.

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.942
C. AND SAID WELL. YOU KNOW

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:15.279
MIGHT BE SO HOW ABOUT A HOUSE

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:16.080
WE DECIDED WITHIN THE BROAD

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:19.316
CATEGORY THAT ASD TREATMENTS-

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.684
WE'RE SENSUALLY NOT CONSIDERED

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.653
TO BE COVERED SHOULD BE COVERED

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:23.821
BY HEALTH CARE SO I MEAN YOU

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:24.855
CAN ARE YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:27.257
BACK CATEGORY THAT COULD I MEAN

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:27.825
IT'S AN INTERPRETATION ISSUE

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.928
THAT. SO WHAT POINT THE

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:32.830
DECISION FALL TOWARD. AT WHICH

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.531
THEN NECESSITATED I GUESS WE

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:35.999
CAN ARGUE WHETHER NECESSITY BUT

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.734
ESSENTIALLY RESULTED IN A BILL

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.104
AND MANDATE TO NOW COVER IT

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.472
BECAUSE THE DECISION ALWAYS

00:45:41.538 --> 00:45:42.639
SEEM TO BE THAT NO IT WASN'T.

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:43.907
BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY WHAT PLANS

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.876
CONSTANTLY TOLD THE PATIENTS

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.679
OKAY THAT OKAY SO THOUSAND FEET

00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:49.546
SO BASICALLY WE HAVE BROAD

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.748
CATEGORIES AND I TRY TO FOR YOU

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.550
TO HAVE A SPECIFIC STATUTE LIKE

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:55.786
THE ONE THAT WE HAVE IN

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:56.820
CALIFORNIA TO. BE H. T. YEAH

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:59.823
THAT. TRYING TO GIVE BECAUSE-

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.724
AGAIN YOU THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BY

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:03.026
WHY GET BILLS. GAIL DIFFERENT

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:03.827
REASONS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:04.394
BUT I MEAN THAT THAT'S AN

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:06.163
EXAMPLE IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.931
ETCETERA BUT IT IS. AN AREA

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:09.066
WHERE PEOPLE SAID WELL LOOK YOU

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.701
KNOW WE THINK. PEOPLE ARE

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.202
GETTING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.270
THE HEALTH PLANS CONSTANTLY

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:15.072
TELL US THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.773
TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR IT IT'S

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.676
YOU KNOW AND- OFTENTIMES

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:20.744
EXCUSE. GO GET IT FROM THE

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:22.246
SCHOOL. BY WHICH WE PAY FOR

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:25.215
VITAL BILL. AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.850
THE VENT THAT COMMUNITY CAME TO

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.452
US AND WE WANT INSURANCE

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:31.722
MANDATE EVERY TIME TURN AROUND

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.757
AND SELL. THE THEN IS THAT PART

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.226
OF IT WHY DID THEY END UP.

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:36.994
TURNING TO LEGISLATURE IS

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.029
BECAUSE- UNDER THE LAW BROAD

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.864
CATEGORIES THAT EXISTED THEN.

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:41.999
RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD THIS BROAD

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.667
CATEGORIES. SOMEHOW IT

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.169
DETERMINATION WAS MADE BY

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:48.705
SOMEONE. AT THE IDEA OF THE

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:49.940
PLANS THEMSELVES CERTAINLY

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:50.641
DECIDE OLD THAT HAITIANS BUT

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:53.010
ALSO I GUESS. THE REGULATOR

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.511
YEUTTER SAID WELL WE KIND OF GO

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.445
ALONG WITH THE PLANS BECAUSE

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:56.813
THEY WEREN'T YOUR GOING AROUND

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.448
OVER TELLING TRANSCEND AND I

00:46:58.515 --> 00:46:59.883
KNOW THAT'S WRONG SO HOW DO WE

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.718
DECIDED THAT WAS NOT. BE

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:06.123
INCLUDED IN. THIS IN THIS. HER

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.591
DEATH. OF BASIC HEALTH SERVICES

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:10.227
SO I. THAT FOR EACH SITUATION

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.962
IT MIGHT DIFFER I THINK IN THE

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.197
EXAMPLE THAT YOU'RE GIVEN.

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:15.365
THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER SINCE

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:17.568
I THINK HISTORICAL CONTEXT IT

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:18.936
MAY BE PART OF IT THAT. THERE

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.671
WAS A THERE WAS A THOUGHT AT

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.706
THE TIME- THAT THIS WAS

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:23.974
SOMETHING THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.777
BE COVERING AND- AND CLEARLY

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:29.780
THE THINKING ON THIS AND

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.882
COVERAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:34.818
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE P. H. TO

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.788
LOOK PAST HAS. FALL RIGHT AND I.

00:47:37.854 --> 00:47:41.158
AND STATE MENTAL HEALTH. AND

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:41.758
FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.126
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:45.229
FOCUS- ON COVERAGE OF THESE

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:48.398
THINGS SO I THINK OF THAT.

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:51.935
THERE WAS. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN

00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:53.670
THOUGHT TO BE HEALTH CARE

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:56.006
COVERAGE MAYBE TWENTY TO THIRTY

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.674
YEARSAGO AND SO SOMETIMES

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:59.543
THESE THINGS EVOLVE ESPECIALLY

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.178
IN THE AREA O MENTAL HEALTH

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:04.381
AND SO I THINK THAT AS I

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:06.750
UNDERSTAND IT AT THAT TIME THE

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:15.759
LEGISLATURE OFFICE. TO ANSWER

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:16.627
THE- AND DEFENDED SAY THIS IS A

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:17.194
HEALTH CARE SO AND IT WILL A

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:18.228
VERY. RANGE OF SERVICES THAT

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:18.996
DIDN'T MAYBE AS NEATLY FALL

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.130
INTO SOME OF THE CAT. THAT ARE

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:22.165
USED TO DESCRIBE BASIC

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.567
HEALTHCARE SERVICES I WAS SO

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.269
LIKE YOU KNOW IT IT. WHETHER OR

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:26.870
NOT IT'S REALLY AT THE

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:27.604
CONSERVATIVE IT'S BEING

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.673
PROVIDED BY YOU KNOW A PARA

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.308
PROFESSIONAL IN THE HOME SO I

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.610
THINK IT GOT MAYBE IT WAS IN

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:36.079
THE AREA THAT IT WAS SOMEONE IN

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.648
MARTIN'S AT THE TIME I AM AND

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.383
WHAT NOT AS CLEAR. AS LIKE YOU

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:41.385
KNOW FIXING A BOWL EARLY RIGHT

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:44.187
AND SO- SO I DON'T HAVE AN

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:47.024
EXACT ANSWER FOR YOU AS TO YOU

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.661
KNOW WHY THERE WAS A SPECIFIC

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.562
REASON WHY THAT SPECIFIC

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:55.532
PROVISION WAS- WAS PASSED BUT I

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.035
THINK THAT- I THINK THAT

00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.904
SOMETIMES. THE THINKING AND-

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.739
THE EVOLVING OF WHAT SHOULD BE

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:05.042
COVERED- HAPPENS AND THEN

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.410
THERE'S CATIONS WHERE THE

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:07.678
LEGISLATURE STEPS IN AND SAYS.

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:08.845
YOU KNOW THIS IS DEFINITELY

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:09.780
SOMETHING THAT HEALTH PLAN

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:11.248
SHOULD BE COVERED AND THAT'S

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:14.184
BAD EXAMPLE OKAY. I APPRECIATE

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.185
YOUR ANSWER AND I DON'T WANT

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.286
YOU TO FEEL LIKE I'M PICKING ON

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:17.854
YOU SPECIFICALLY BUT SINCE

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.222
YOU'RE TO A TOPIC BECAUSE IT

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.290
BECAUSE I THINK THIS REFLECTS

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:21.591
ON THE TENT SO INTENTIONS

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.960
BECAUSE AS YOU EXPRESS IN YOUR

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:27.698
ANSWER. AND THAT. IS THAT WELL

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.099
WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.068
ISSUE AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW AND

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:31.735
THERE IS AGAIN TREMENDOUS

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:34.204
PRESSURE. FROM PEOPLE ABOUT

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.739
WELL YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GET

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.740
ACCESS THE SERVICES WE THINK IT

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.909
SHOULD BE FROM. PLANS THAT YOU

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:39.743
SAID WHAT WE KIND OF LOOK

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.044
HISTORICALLY THAT SOMETHING WE

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.713
NORMALLY COVERED RIGHT. BUT

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.147
SAME TIME WE'VE ALSO TALKED

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:49.753
ABOUT WELL. MANDATE CNO WE ALSO

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.354
WILL FALL OFF RIGHT TO NOT BE

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.888
INVOLVED. OF ALL. MORE SO MORE

00:49:51.955 --> 00:49:54.491
MAYBE INVOLVING. AND SO NOW THE

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:56.793
TENSION AYE. THE OUT TRYING TO

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.429
FIGURE OUT HOW HE RESOLVES THIS

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:02.566
RIGHT SO. WE HAVE ESSENTIAL

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:05.535
HEALTH BENEFITS YOU KNOW ACA

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:06.737
WOULD LEAD THE STATE LAW ALL

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:07.771
RIGHT WE SELECTED OURSELVES

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.173
ABOUT IT AND JUST AND JUST TO

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.843
BE SURE I GOT IT RIGHT- MISSED

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.946
FILES ARE NO OKAY SO IT HAS TO

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:19.349
BE IN THE STATE BENCHMARK PLAN

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:22.052
AT THE TIME OF. JERRY FIRST

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:22.719
TWENTY TWELVE RIGHT SO IT'S NOT

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:24.354
LIKE THE BIT THE BENCHMARK PLAN

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.623
CHANGE THERE. THE OUTSIDE TO

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.824
ADD SOMETHING SUBSEQUENT TO

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.459
THAT THAT STILL DOESN'T COUNT

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.661
RATE BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BE AT

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.496
THE TIME OF THAT YEAR AND I

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:35.365
CORRECT. RIGHT THE BENEFIT HAD

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.767
TO BE IN PLACE BY DECEMBER

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.935
THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:39.703
ELEVEN FOURTEEN NOT EXCEED THE

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.038
GENEROSITY IS THE STATE

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.440
BENCHMARK PLAN YET RIGHT SO

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:44.908
EVEN IF KAISER WENT BACK AND

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.143
SAID WE DECIDE ADDED DIFFERENT

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:48.011
COVERAGE THINGS. ON THEIR OWN

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.246
TO THE BENCHMARK PLAN THAT

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:50.947
WOULD NOT THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:53.683
DOESN'T APPLY TO THE BENCHMARK

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.086
IS FIX THAT. DECEMBER THIRTY

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:57.087
FIRST TWENTY ELEVEN I GUESS

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.790
RIGHT. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:01.324
IS THAT NOW WE GOT STRUGGLE

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.694
WITH. HISTORY WE LACK THE

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:07.030
PARTICULAR DATE DOWN. AND

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.398
THINGS ARE EVOLVING STILL

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:11.101
TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES EVEN SOCIETY

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.003
HELP OFFICE RIGHT AND SO WHEN

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.604
BIG THINGS THAT CONTINUES TO BE

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.173
TALKED ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:18.341
PARITY IN WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.676
SUPPOSED TO MEAN AND I THINK

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:20.277
THEY'RE MADE. I THINK THERE'S

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.011
SOME MORE EVEN LEGISLATION

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:25.582
ABOUT. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.551
AND I REALIZE WERE SIR TIED

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:29.352
LITTLE BIT TO THE LAWS. IN A

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.288
BID TO LOSS TO AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.355
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BE

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.824
WILLING TO PAY FOR WHICH THEN

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.292
BECOMES WHAT'S THE STATE

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.293
WILLING TO PAY FOR. THE FEDS

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:39.229
ARE PAYING FOR- ARE YOU SEE IS

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.931
NAVIGATING THE FACT THAT WE

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:43.433
ALSO HAVE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.401
FIGURE OUT HOW TO OF ALL OF

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:48.572
THEM BECAUSE- THIS IT IS WHAT.

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:49.673
EXPECTATIONS AND TING HE HAS

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.475
INVOLVED IN THE- MEDICINE AND

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:52.776
RELATED AND HEALTH CARE HAS

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:56.780
EVOLVED. AT HOW HOW DO WE TRY

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.516
TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OF. WELL

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:02.552
BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME WERE

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:05.355
SORT OF LOCKED IN LEGISLATIVELY

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:06.456
AND ACTUALLY SO I GUESS THE

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.791
OTHER INTERESTING QUESTION IS

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.392
RELATED TO THAT. WOULD BE IS

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:14.264
THAT. SO THE BENCHMARK PLAN

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:17.100
HOUSE SPECIFIC IS THIS- BECAUSE

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.002
WE A BROAD REQUIREMENTS SO I

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:20.170
MEAN IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.538
BENCHMARK PLAN WOULD HAVE OR

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:23.974
NOT HAVE COVERED THAT IN ON

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.176
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY. A

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.878
LOT OF AND IS THE IT'S WHAT

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.045
EVERYONE'S GONNA LOOK BACK TO

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.081
AND SAY WELL THAT'S- SAID THAT

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.549
IT'S THAT INTERPRETATION EVEN

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:33.517
IF SOMEONE SAYS IN THE FUTURE

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.351
WE INTERPRET A LITTLE

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:35.986
DIFFERENTLY YES IT'S WHATEVER

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.754
WAS IN PLACE F. WITH A STATE

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:39.289
BENCH MY PLANET OFFERED. BY

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.358
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:43.493
AND ANY STATE. MANDATED THAT

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.128
WAS IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS IN

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.163
THAT BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT WAS

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.065
ALREADY IN PLACE SO CALIFORNIA

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:52.335
HAS MORE. I WOULD SAY THE-

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:53.103
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES THAT

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.971
ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.640
BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT MAYBE SOME

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.808
OTHER STATES WITH- BUT IS THE

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.677
FACT THAT IT WAS THE CUT OFF

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:01.378
DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:03.413
THOMAS NAY LEVIN SO. IF THERE'S

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.916
NEW STATE MANDATED BENEFITS

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.350
THAT'S WHEN IT'S TAKEN ME TO.

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.919
THE CAR AND WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:11.121
TAKE A LOOK AT. SO IN OTHER

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:15.225
OPTIONS OBVIOUSLY. THE FEDERAL

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:18.862
PROVIDE THAT MORE. VILLAGE.

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:22.098
SOMETHING COULD BARELY INTO BUT

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:22.999
BEING VERY MY OF THE OBVIOUSLY

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.268
ANY IN TO SERVICE WELL USUAL

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.737
INCREASE THE PREMIUMS RIGHT AND

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:29.606
SO THAT WILL THAT WILL HAVE

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.341
IMPACT TO OUR CONSUMERS AS WELL

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:33.410
TO- AS FAR AS THIS FEDERAL

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:34.945
SUBSIDIES WILL PROBABLY GO UP

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.479
AS WELL AS THE STATE SUBSIDIES

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.548
BUT FOR SURE IT WILL IMPACT

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.150
POTENTIALLY ARE OFF EXCHANGE

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.152
MEMBERS WHICH WE HAVE OVER FOUR

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.887
HUNDRED AND TWENTY. THOUSAND

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:46.256
THE OFF EXCHANGE MARKET RIGHT

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:49.092
NOW THAT POTENTIALLY WOULD NEED

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.260
TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE WHETHER

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:52.228
OR NOT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:53.830
GETTING THE YOU KNOW. FOR THE

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.932

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:56.933
FOR THEM WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.504
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:02.606

SPECIFICALLY LISTED. AND THAT

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:17.053
CONSTRAINS WHAT THE SCOPE OF

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:17.654

USUALLY THEY THAT. EIGHT

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.409
INCREASED. THE PLAN AT THIS

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:43.179
SAME TIME. THE REASON YOU BUY A

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:45.048

OVERSIGHT. OF THE- AND THE

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:41.517

THAT WHAT I WANT TO GET THE

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:13.883
CSTS. IT'S CENTER- BUT I THINK

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.051
ONE OF THINGS THAT WE JUST WANT

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.220

SO BLOOM AND I NEED TO SURE HE

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.976
GETS THE CREDIT FOR DOING BILL

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:45.748

ADDRESS THIS ON A LARGER ISSUE-

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.793
IN TERMS OF- I MEAN. I GUESS

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.361
ONE INTERESTING QUESTION WOULD

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:38.961
BE IS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.797
GOTTEN ESTIMATES PER MANDATE

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.800
AND I'M A PAST AND SOME HAVEN'T.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:44.734
ONE TO FIND THE CUMULATIVE

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.836
IMPACT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW EACH

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.604
ONE SEEMS LIKE- IT'S ONLY YOU

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.540
KNOW IT'S A DOLLAR A YEAR IT'S

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:53.509
FIFTY CENTS A YEAR IT'S THAT

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.043
ARE BUT THEN WE START. AT

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.545
ADDING THEM UP AS WELL AS

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:58.181
THERE. ARE SOME SENSE OF

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.783
CUMULATIVE IMPACT AS WELL AS

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.585
YOUR BIRDS LOOK THAT- WE HAVE

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.520
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.856
THE TO BURKE WORKED WITH MIL

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.492
MEN IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.161
VARIOUS BENCHMARK OPTIONS BACK

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:12.995
IN TWO THOUSAND. EIGHTEEN AND-

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.398
BRUCE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE STATE

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:15.898
BUDGET TO STICK WITH THE

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:20.436
EXISTING KAISER HMO PLAN BUT

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.004
YOU KNOW WE DID LOOK AT OKAY

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.973
WELL WHAT ARE THESE OTHER TESTS

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.144
OUTSIDE OF THAT AND I MEAN IN A

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.178
SOAP. CERTAINLY LOOKING

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.113
BACKWARDS DIFFICULT TO THEN

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.114
FIGURE OUT WILL WHAT IS

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.448
COUNTERFACTUAL WHAT WOULD HAVE

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.684
HAPPENED. IN REGULAR MEDICINE

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.385
AND PLANS WITH A COVERED ANYWAY

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.987
OR WHAT WAS DUE TO THE TO THE

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.989
MANDATE SO. A LOT OF THESE A

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:42.692
RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES ARE

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:43.793
REALLY DIFFICULT AND GIVE YOU A

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.361
RANGE THAT KIND OF MAKES YOU

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.263
OKAY THAT VERIFIES COMMONSENSE.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.198
BUT IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.400
ON THAT'S MY HESITATION ONE.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.402
POLICY WANT ME LOVE THAT IDEA

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.204
THAT WOULD BE MY IDEA OF A

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:59.375
VACATION- THE ACCURATE. KING TO

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.711
TRY TO GIVE THAT IS A CLEAR

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.279
ROADMAP TO THE FUTURE ISN'T

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.382
THAT. ACCURATE OKAY BUT

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.517
CERTAINLY I THINK THERE IS A

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.219
PLACE OF BEING ABLE TO PROJECT

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.388
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD SOME OF

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.390
THE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.658
CURRENTLY PART OF THE BENCHMARK

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.727
LIKE INFERTILITY OR

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.362
CHIROPRACTIC PEDIATRIC

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.297
CARRONADES CERTAINLY DOING I'LL

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.498

WITH MAYBE MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.269
BUT- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:28.938
COULD SUPPORT. YEAH I MEAN AS

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:31.874
FAR IS THAT THE- WELL MAYBE

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.442
DIFFICULT THERE'S ALSO MAYBE

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.477
SOME VALUE SAYING WHAT WE

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.878
PROJECTED THIS IN THIS WHAT

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.180
REALLY HAPPENED AND THIS IS

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.081
WHAT WE'RE WORK YOU KNOW THAT

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:41.584
THE SIMI THAT. THAT THE MANDATE

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.885
HAD YELLED. AND THE PLACE I

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.720
REALIZE. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.022
NOT TRYING TO ADD TO ANY NEW

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.925
ONES RIGHT NOW. BUT OKAY. ALL

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:52.428
RIGHT. RIGHT QUESTIONS AND IF I

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.064
GUESS IS PLEASE ANY KNOW BEAR

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.967
MY- A LOT OF- A LOT OF THE

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:03.239
TENSIONS. HOW IN THE SINKING SO

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.140
AS PRACTICE OF. BECAUSE A LOT

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.775
OF. WE HAVE A COUPLE PRACTICE

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.510
CHANGE R OTHER YOU KNOW TAKING

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.911
ON AND PROVIDING CERTAIN

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.113
SERVICES SOMETIMES AT. LOWER

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.115
COST OR PARA PROFESSIONALS ARE

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.817
ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SO

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.452
AS IS THE POLLUTION OCCURS

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.888
COVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DON'T.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.324
TO RUB UP AGAINST EACH FEES SO

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.260
THERE IS. AS WE SAID BUT I

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:24.894
THINK OF THESE TONIC PLATE. OF

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:28.798
HEALTH CARE. IS ALLOWANCE FOR

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.833
THIS EVOLUTION OCCUR THAT DON'T

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.602
BUMP UP WITH THE- YEAH I MEAN

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.170
THAT WHEN. THAT PERHAPS SAID

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.372
BIGGIES. IS THAT- WITH THE

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.773
DEVELOPMENT OF BETTER

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.842
TECHNIQUES FOR EXAMPLE CATHER'S

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.577
ASIAN CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION.

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.312
MUCH TO THIS MAY I THINK OF THE

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:44.480
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEONS REMOVED

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.482
FROM BY PASSES TO KAT YELLED

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.418
VARIOUS CATHETER TECHNIQUES FOR

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.721
STENSON OTHER TYPES OF THINGS-

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:53.356
AND THAT ALL HAPPENED UNDER THE

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.825
UMBRELLA OF. THE EXISTING-

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.727
BASIC HEALTH BENEFITS RIGHT BUT

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:58.694
THOSE WERE THAT WAS IT THAT'S A

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:03.099
PRETTY BIG SHIFT. AND INCLUDING

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.868
CUT COSTS AND SO FORTH SO. AND

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.103
I'M SURE THERE'S MANY OTHERS WE

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.872
CAN POINT TO APPRECIATE THAT

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:13.542

UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF WHAT

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:21.417
HAPPENED IS WE IF THERE ARE

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.566

CONTINUES TO CLOSE THE

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.380
UNINSURED GAP AND- WE LOOK FOR

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:05.381
TO MAKING MORE STRIDES THIS

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.349
YEAR HOME ON THAT ISSUE-

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:08.951
CALIFORNIANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:12.021
MARKET PAY LESS FOR HEALTH

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:13.189
INSURANCE- ON AVERAGE- THAN THE

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.291
AVERAGE AMERICAN IN ACCORDANCE

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.559

CONSISTENTLY BEEN HEALTHIER

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:21.497
THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AS

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.833
WELL. AND THE REASON FOR THIS

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.768
SUCCESS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.670
LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION-

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:29.038
HAVE ME DECISION SOMETIME

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.207
DIFFICULT DECISIONS ON THAT

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.842
HAVE LED TO MARKET STABILITY-

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.777
EXAMPLES OF THIS- INCLUDE THE

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.111
EARLY EARLY IN RELATIVELY

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:37.546
AGGRESSIVE ADOPTION OF THE

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.081
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- IN

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.617
CALIFORNIA. I'M IN ONE CRIME A

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.919
RECENT EXAMPLE- IZZY ENACTMENT

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.754
OF A STATE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.523
COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OR THE

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.058
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN LAST

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.726
YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THIS

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.628
REQUIREMENT COUPLED WITH STATES

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:56.999
CITIES. IS ALREADY RESULTING IN

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.735
SOME OF DEVELOPMENTS. MOST

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.036
NOTABLY THE PRODUCTS SO IT

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:02.571
COVERED CALIFORNIA TWENTY

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.706
TWENTY ARE EXPERIENCING AN

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:04.673
AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE OF A

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.575
LITTLE LESS THAN 1% AND I THINK

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.344
THAT'S A PRETTY NOTEWORTHY

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:11.013
ACHIEVEMENT- IN JUST YESTERDAY

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.582
AS AS A SUMMER WOULD MENTION TO

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.416
COVER CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCED ITS

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.985
HIGHEST ENROLLMENT NUMBERS

SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND A 40%

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.823
INCREASE- OVER LAST YEAR'S

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.958
FIGURES SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS AS

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.727
WELL ON ANOTHER KEY REASON FOR

01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:26.929
CALIFORNIA WELL TO MARKET

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.064
STABILITY- WHICH A LOOSE LITTLE

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.232
BIT LATER IS THAT OUR STATE IS

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.868
DECIDEDLY IN HISTORICALLY

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:36.505
MANAGED IN ITS MARKET

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:37.873

SORT OF KEEP THE PRESSURE OFF

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:10.818
OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.386
WE FACE HAS THIS IS COME ALONG.

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.388
THE A REALLY LOADED. WELL YEAH

01:33:14.455 --> 01:33:15.856
I MEAN I KNEW WHEN I SUGGESTED

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:16.691
THAT I WOULD GET A HARD

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:20.561
QUESTION SO- THAT I DON'T HAVE

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.963
THE ANSWER TO. YOU KNOW I'D

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:25.466
THAT I'D- I THINK A PERIODIC

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:28.002
REVIEWS IS NOT OUT OF THE

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:28.636
QUESTION YOUR POSITION ON THAT

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.771
BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TO

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.740
BE I YOU KNOW THE CONCEPTS THAT

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:34.575
WE BROUGHT UP EARLIER AROUND.

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:37.078
IN AS A KID AND CHANGES IN THE

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.413
HEALTH CARE SPACE- YOU KNOW YOU

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.349
WOULD WANT A PRODUCT TO BE IN

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:42.717
PLACE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:45.619
YEARS IN ORDER TO. CONSISTENT

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:48.422
ON IN TO SEE- YOU KNOW HOW IT'S

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:49.957
IMPACTING THE OVERALL COST OF

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:53.894
CARE- AND- YOU KNOW DIDN'T DO

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:54.996
SOME MEASUREMENTS AND THINGS OF

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:56.731
THAT NATURE- IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:59.600
WE HAD CONSIDERED I THINK WE

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.569
WERE POOR OFFERING IT AND IS A

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:04.939
IN THE MORNING BUDGET CALLED.

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.474
THEN WHEN THE WAR OFF BILLION

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.676
YOU KNOW UNTIL IT IS EVERY YEAR.

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.211
WHAT IS I WAS I WOULD SAY JUST

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.546
IN IN GENERAL IT'S IT IS A

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:15.816
CHALLENGE I THINK AS- IT WITH

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:18.419
INSURANCE IN GENERAL- PEOPLE

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.354
HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT. THAT

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:22.289
THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.025
COMPLETELY COVERED- ME SEE FOR

01:34:24.091 --> 01:34:25.793
EXAMPLE- WHILE IT'S NOT THIS

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.896
ISN'T. THIS ISN'T A INSURANCE

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:31.999
COMMITTEE BRING- I THINK OF

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.802
WILDFIRES IN THE FACT THAT A

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.971
LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY HAD

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.572
COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN THINGS IN

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.941
DID NOT. BUT THEY WERE RICH.

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:44.378
AND CENTER WERE NOT. THIS I.

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:46.047
TWENTY AROUND HEALTH CARE WHEN

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:49.917
PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS- THAT THAT

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:50.684
THERE SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.520
COVERAGE FOR THAT AND I THINK

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:55.523
WHEN THEY FIND THAT THERE ARE

01:34:55.589 --> 01:35:02.329
COVERAGE THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S-

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:03.164
THAT'S WHERE. THAT'S WHERE THE-

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.033
AND SO. PROCESS LOOK AT THE

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.136
PANEL OFF TO BE ADEQUATE AT

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:09.937

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:10.924
WHICH OF THESE. SHOULD

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.992
ULTIMATELY BECOME A BENEFIT

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:15.662
MANDATES- THE AND IT YOU KNOW I

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:16.129
APPRECIATE SOME OF THE

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:19.199
DISCUSSION AROUND TAKE A LOOK

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:20.634
AT THE BIGGER. I ALSO WANT TO

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:23.637
SAY THAT- THE MANY PROPOSAL IT.

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:25.372
A. R. DELAYED WILL HAVE A

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:26.840
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR THE

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:28.575
FOLKS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR THE

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.344
SO. WITH AUTISM IF THAT'S IT IF

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:32.279
IT'S DELAYED FOR A YEAR OR TWO

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:33.847
THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:36.350
ON THOSE CHILDREN WHERE- IT YOU

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.018
KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:40.420
BACK IN TIME AND THEN. IN MAKE

01:42:40.487 --> 01:42:41.522
UP FOR THE BOSS IS THAT WERE

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:43.724
NOT COVERED. I'M SO WHAT WE

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.392
HAVE EIGHT OF SOME DISCUSSION.

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:46.393
BEATING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.495
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS AND SO

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.531
FORTH. ULTIMATELY WE HAVE.

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:52.332
WRONG IN THIS SAYS THE AS- THE

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:55.802
PROCESS WORKS NOT ONLY BENEFIT

01:42:55.869 --> 01:43:01.942
MANDATES BUT LET. ALL AT. THAT

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.610
WE CAN GET IT IS. AND WE OUT.

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:07.114
OF THE BILLS THAT PART. ON

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.650
THESE OF THE CONTINUITY OF CARE

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:13.220
AND THE CHRONIC DISEASE. IT'S A

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:15.889
IT'S A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:18.292
IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.994
GOING TO BE FIXED BY ONE DOCTOR

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:23.430
VISIT OR WHEN. I A OUR VISIT

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:25.966
AND I THINK WE OFTENTIMES LOSE

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.267
TRACK OF THE FACT THAT THESE

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.102
PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH THIS

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.305
DISEASE FOR THE REST OF YOUR

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:34.241
LIFE AND THAT AS MEDICINE

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:39.479
CHANGES DISEASE CHECK. IN TIME

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:41.048
WE'RE NEEDING THINGS I HAVE OF

01:43:41.114 --> 01:43:42.583
WHAT. OF MEDICINE PROVIDE OR IT

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:44.751
TO THE BUT WE CAN'T GET IT AND

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:47.721
THAT HAS BEEN A BIG BIG PROBLEM

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:49.089
IN THE CHRONIC CARE WORLD. IS

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:51.858
THAT WE JUST CAN'T ACCESS TO.

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:54.227
THE THINGS THAT WE NEED BASIC

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.730
THINGS. SO I WITH A LIFE THAT

01:43:56.797 --> 01:44:00.100
ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED. THANK THE

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:03.103
OTHER THING AT ANY AND THIS THE

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.938
PREFERABLY IN MY MIND IS THAT

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.240
WE GIVE THE INCENTIVES TO PULL

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.609
THE DEVELOP WEATHERS THE

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:09.576
BENEFIT DESIGNS ARE THE

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.745
COVERAGES. TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:12.980
SEASONS OF TRYING TO

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:17.651
LEGISLATORS SO FOR EXAMPLE. FOR

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:20.687
CHRONIC AND- RIGHT WE CREATE

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.222
COPAYS I MEAN IT CAME FROM THE

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.057
RAND STUDY TO HAVE PEOPLE THINK

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:26.126
TWICE ABOUT IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:28.161
WE KNOW THAT PITNEY BOWES IT'D

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:30.597
EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY ZEROED OUT-

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:32.633
PAID FOR STORY. IS FOR PEOPLE

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.234
LAST MONTH DOES AFTER ALL.

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:35.335
THERE'S NOT AND WHY WOULD YOU

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.603
WANT THE SCOURGE FROM USING

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:38.138
THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:39.339
ACTUALLY KEEPS THEM FROM

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:41.675
EXACERBATE AS MOTION LEADS TO

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:42.843
BE IN THE YARD HOSPITALS SO

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.111
FORTH AND- THAT ACTUALLY SHOWN

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:46.346
IT. SAVES MONEY ACTUALLY TO DO

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:49.249
THAT THAT THE YEAH YES THE-

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.918
UTILIZATION OF THE STORYTELLERS

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.387
WENT UP. THAT WASN'T SO BAD

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:56.123
THING BECAUSE THE ER VISITS AND

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.457
THE HOUSE POLLUTION AND THESE

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:58.692
ARE ALL. PEOPLE BY THE WAY SO

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.893
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.228
EMPLOYEES SO THESE ARE NOT

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:03.664
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT UNEMPLOYED.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.266
THEY THEY MADE MONEY THEY COULD

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:09.202
MAKE. WELL THEY'LL I CAN USE.

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:10.303
THIS DOES EXACTLY EACH PERSON

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.705
BUT- NOW THEY HAD INCOME TO PAY

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:14.074
THE COPAY BUT IT BUT THE COPAY

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:14.841
AND THE PERSON THE COPAYS MAKE

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.576
PEOPLE THINK TWICE SO.

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:17.911
CERTAINLY SOME MEDICATIONS

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:20.614
MAKES SENSE OTHER MEDICATIONS I

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:22.182
AM ARGUE THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:23.350
WE DON'T LEGISLATE AS A CARD.

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:27.954
SAYING NECESSARILY BUT- WE WANT

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.223
INCENTIVIZE. PEOPLE THINK MAYBE

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.492
SMARTER IF IT DOES FIND AT. IN

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:33.326
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONDITION GET

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:38.732
ACT. TO AREAS IN FRONT OF THEM

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.802
THAT MIGHT. BECAUSE THE TO THE

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:42.969
LESS LIKELY TO SENSES BUT WE

01:45:43.036 --> 01:45:44.638
ALSO KNOW THAT THE OVERALL

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:45.839
INCENTIVE IS YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:46.773
BE THE PLAN THAT'S KNOWN AS THE

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.308
BEST YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.342
TREATS PEOPLE AND DISEASE THE

01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:52.813
BEST ARE AS A BASS IT'S

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:53.380
RELATIVE THING BUT- YOU KNOW

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.315
WHERE AND I'M TRYING TO SEE.

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:56.450
I'M GOING TO THAT. THAT'S NOT

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:57.417
NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THE

01:45:57.484 --> 01:46:00.053
PLANET. LARA AND FROM AN ACTUAL

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.723
STAND SO HOW HOW DO WE HOW WHAT

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:05.425
DO YOU KNOW. WHAT WILL YOU DO

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:06.293
ABOUT THAT SO. AND IT'S FOR

01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:07.194
YEAH WE DON'T ALLEGE.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.562
PARTICULAR DESIGN BECAUSE I'M

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.030
NOT SURE WE CAN COME UP WITH A

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:11.431
BETTER ONE THAN. BUT HOW

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:13.200
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:16.403
THESE KIND MORE. INNOVATIVE THE

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:19.439
BENEFIT DESIGNS. RIGHT SO I

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.774
KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE BEYOND

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:23.176
JUST. INSURANCE MANDATES BUT-

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:26.813
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW WITH WITH

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.582
RESPECT TO CARD CONDITIONS OF

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:29.649
THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE USED

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:30.584
THEIR OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:32.953
AND- MANY IF NOT. THE VAST

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:34.421
MAJORITY ARE SMART SPECIALTY

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:38.258
MEDS THAT YOU KNOW- REPRESENT A

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:39.059
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.627
PRESCRIPTIONS BUT A GIGANTIC

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:44.164
PERCENTAGE OF THE COST- IN SO

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:46.299
THAT HAS AN IMPACT. ON THE YOU

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:51.638
KNOW- STRUCTURE IN PRICING- SO

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.006
YOU KNOW IF I. SOME PLAN ARE ON

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.374

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:55.542
DEPARTMENT AND THERE ARE

01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:58.278
CERTAIN DRUGS- WHERE. THE PLAN

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.513
ON ITS OWN HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:03.550
LOWER THE COST TO PAY- TO DO A

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.852
VERY AFFORDABLE LEVELS. YOU

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:07.320

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:08.188
COMMENTS AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:09.890
LEGISLATE THOSE THINGS BECAUSE

01:47:09.956 --> 01:47:10.624
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:11.691
LEGISLATIVELY YOU'RE BASICALLY

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:14.327

BIG TIME BECAUSE- THEY'RE ABLE

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.398
TO. LOWER THOSE COSTS FOR

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:21.234
TUMORS BECAUSE- ON- THEY'RE

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.903
ABLE TO GET A GREAT PRICE. FROM

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.204
THE DRUG MANUFACTURER THE

THE PART OF THE PAYER TO GET

EVERY THERE IS. AND THAT'S THE

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:42.175
OF SO WHEN PREMIUMS ARE

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:43.677
INCREASING INCREASES THE COST

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:45.078

THAT WE NEED TO- TO REVISIT-

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.738
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.273
THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:55.308
THIS FOR MANY YEARS. SINCE WE

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:57.911

THOUGHT THEY GOT HEALTH CARE

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.165
COVERAGE AND WHEN THE TIME

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:23.236
IS ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:24.771

COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE- THROUGH

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.829

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.599
THEN OF COURSE THINGS HAVE.

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:54.868
ALSO EVOLVED OVER TIME SO- THAT

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:56.669
WAS NO BACK AND WE'LL TALK

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:58.471

OF FREE TO SAY THAT WOULD LOOK

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:26.766
AT THE MORE SUS THAT. AND AT

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:28.768

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:05.071
