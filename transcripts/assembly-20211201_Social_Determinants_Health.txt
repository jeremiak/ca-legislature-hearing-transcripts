OPENING YOUR DOORS TO US AND LETTING US HOLD OUR HEARING HERE TODAY. AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE IT IS VERY SPECIAL FOR ME TO HOST THE FIRST HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN MY DISTRICT AND ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF TACKLING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USE OUR- I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US VIRTUALLY. AND GIVE A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS WARD OF THE SEVENTY EIGHTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHO IS HERE WITH US THIS MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY VIEW THIS HEARING ON THE ASSEMBLY LIVESTREAM WEBSITE. OR BY CALLING INTO THE TOLL FREE NUMBER WHICH IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE EIGHT FIVE ZERO. TODAY WILL BE AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING GIVING US AN OVERVIEW ON WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION WHICH WILL BUILD ON IN FUTURE HEARINGS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE BORN. LIVE WORK PLAY AND H. AND HOW THOSE CONDITIONS IMPACT THE OUTCOME OF ONE'S HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THEM THE HEALTH CARE SPACE FOR A LONG TIME. CITIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AROUND 7280% OF WHAT HAPPENS TO ONCE HEALTH. IS THE RESULT OF SOCIETAL FACTORS INDEPENDENT OF WHAT OCCURS IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING. AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN THE DISCUSSION OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IS NOW BEING DISCUSSED OUTSIDE THE HEALTHCARE SETTINGS TO. THE DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN THAT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COLBERT NINETEEN. THE SAME COMMUNITIES WERE OFTEN SEEM TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES OBESITY COPD. THAT PUT THEM AT HIGHER RISK FOR NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IF INFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THOSE VERY SAME COMMUNITIES ALSO SAW THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES LET GROCERY STORES. TO GET FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EAT HEALTHY. LACK PARK AND OTHER GREEN OPEN SPACES TO PLAY AN EXERCISE. TO STAY IN SHAPE. LACK EASY ACCESS TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITIES TO GET PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE. YOU ALSO NOTICE THAT THE SCHOOLS IN THOSE VERY SAME COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES HAVE THE LOWEST ACADEMIC ACHIEVING OUTCOMES. AN ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY AND EXPECTATION GAP IS WIDE BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND THOSE COMMUNITIES VERSUS CHILDREN AND OTHER AREAS. THESE COMMUNITIES ALSO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF DISTRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HIGH RATES OF USE OF FORCE WHICH CREATES MORE STRESS WITHIN THE MEMBERS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND MANY OF US KNOW. THE DEVASTATING NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF STRESS ON ONE'S HOUSE. I COULD GO ON AND ON AND TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC HOUSING TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENTAL DISPARITIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK YOU GET THE PICTURE. AND ALL OF THIS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON YOUR HEALTH RISK AND YOUR HEALTH OUTCOME. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS IN SOCIETY AND WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR HEALTH ISRAEL. AND IN ORDER TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST DISCUSS AND BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT DISMANTLING THESE INEQUALITIES AND ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE. SO THIS SELECT COMMITTEE WILL HOLD INTER DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF HOW THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WILL MAKE POLICY AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. ON HOW TO BEST IMPROVE THE HEALTH EDUCATIONAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETY OUTCOME FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT IS OUR PURPOSE. THAT IS OUR MISSION. AND THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO. BEFORE WE BEGIN THE PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP DR CHRISTIAN WALLACE THE C. E. O. OF GROSSMONT HEALTHCARE DISTRICT TO GIVE SOME OPENING REMARKS.

WHEN I REMIND US WE ARE IN CONNECTED AND I WILL GET LEANING HELD AS THOSE ARE US. THAT IS UNLESS IN DISEASE FOLLOWING A THAT WE ARE SET. AND IT ON HOW WELL EVERYONE ELSE IS SUPPORT. IT WILL INITIALLY WHY ACT WITH AND WE- THE LATEST I CAN SEE ROAD HOW. OF RACIAL ETHNIC WORDS INCREASES SEVERAL POPULAR. I IT IS EASIER TO DESPAIR. THREATEN OUR PANDEMIC RECOVERY. HOWEVER I MIGHT HANDLE SAYS I BELIEVE PROCESS ARE PREDICTED FACTORS BECAUSE OF THE PER FACTORS.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH DR ROWE HAND BREADED FRIED KRISHNA. THAT WAS AN AMAZING PRESENTATION- THANK YOU FOR HELPING US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT EXACTLY THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE AND THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD ON CALIFORNIA'S SOCIETY OVER TIME. AND SHOWING IS ALSO A CALIFORNIA'S DOING I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH ALL OF THE THINGS ON THE WEBSITE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY PLACES INDEX FOR OUR RESIDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND REALLY GET A GOOD ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THEY LIVE AND THE RISK FACTORS FOR HEALTH RISK FACTORS AS A RESULT OF THAT. AND THAT YOU HAVE CHALLENGED US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS MORE ON- UPSTREAM WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POLICIES AND FUNDING AND NOT JUST FOCUS ON THE DOWNSTREAM. ON BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE BUILD RESILIENT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ARE WE LOOK FORWARD TO SITTING DOWN WITH YOU WHEN I GET BACK UP TO SACRAMENTO IN TALKING ABOUT THIS. ONE PERSON BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US ON OUR FIRST HEARING THIS AFTERNOON OR THIS MORNING. NEXT WE HAVE. ONE OF THE JEWELS AND SAN DIEGO MEDICAL SOCIETY. DR RODNEY HAD. DR HEARD IS PRESIDENT OF THE MULTICULTURAL HEALTH FOUNDATION AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. A PHYSICIAN OF INTERNAL MEDICINE AND PRIVATE PRACTICE DOCTOR HOOD IS THE MANAGING PARTNER OF THE CARE VIEW MEDICAL GROUP. HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE MULTICULTURAL IPA WHICH SPECIALIZES IN SERVING AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS. ASIAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN PATIENTS. HE IS A NATIONAL AUTHORITY ON HEALTH DISPARITIES MEDICAL HISTORY AND RACISM AND MEDICAL CARE. HE SERVES ON LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL BOARD AND COMMISSIONS AND IT'S TRULY A PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT HE'S HERE WITH US TODAY. WITH NO FURTHER DELAY IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE DR RONNY HEAD. A GOOD MORNING AND- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DOCTOR WEBER AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- CHRIS WARD FOR INVITING ME. I'M GONNA GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT GIVING IT FROM THE HISTORIC POINT OF VIEW. SO OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. I'VE BEEN ON- PHYSICIAN IN SOUTHEAST SAN DIEGO. AND AS PAST PRESIDENT NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING THE ORIGINS OF RACE ETHNICITY AND HOW IT INTERSECTS WITH WHAT WE CALL SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN THERE FOR MY TALK TODAY HISTORIC ASPECTS OF AMERICAN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY. D. AND IS IT SHOWING. AT THE MONOLOGUE WORK ON OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THE WELL THEY'RE DOING THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATED THE- PREVIOUS- DISCUSSION. OUR WITH THE OFFICE OF- HELP THE EQUITY- WHEN I FIRST STARTED DO SO RESEARCH OF PEOPLE- WE DIDN'T REALLY CALL WITH THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE TALKED ABOUT- HOW RACE AND ETHNICITY- HAD SOME TYPE OF A RELATIONSHIP WHAT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE SEE BETWEEN HEALTH OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS RACES AND ETHNICITIES IS REALLY NOT ABOUT GENETICS IS MORE ABOUT. WE LIVE AND HOW YOU TREATED AND HOW YOU PROCEED IN THIS- SOCIETY- SO- WHEN I TALK ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EARLY ON THERE WAS A FOCUS ON SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS. THE GEOGRAPHY JOB STATUS YOUR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO FOOD. IN YOUR GENDER AND THEN WE MENTIONED RACE ETHNICITY RACISM BIAS DISCRIMINATION AND TOXIC STRESS THE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THAT INTO PLAY BECAUSE HELP HISTORIAN AND I THINK IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE HISTORY TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT. I'M OUR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OTHER CONDITIONS IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE LEARN WORK PLAY THAT AFFECT A WIDE RANGE OF- OUTCOMES. ON AND- I'M GONNA TALK MORE ABOUT RACE ETHNICITY AND TOXIC STRESS. IN HISTORY. DOES HAVING A FLIGHT HOME FOR BIGELOW ALL RIGHT. SO LET ME TALK ABOUT HOW I SEE THE CULTURE OF RACISM IN AMERICA. SO I AM AN EXPERT IT EATING GUMBO BUT CERTAINLY NOT AN EXPERT AT MAKING UP IT WAS MY WIFE THE INTRODUCED ME TO GUMBO AND IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT GUMBEL IS LOOKS DIFFERENT IN TASTE DIFFERENT DEPENDING UPON WHO'S MAKING IT AND WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING WITH RACE AND RACES IN THE INGREDIENTS FOR BUMBLE IS ROOT VEGETABLES SAUSAGE CHICKEN SEAFOOD IF YOU LAY POWDER DEPENDING UPON WHO'S MAKING IT WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SOME OF THAT HAS A LOT A LOT OF- TOMATO BASIC CETERA. WHAT IS THE INGREDIENTS TO THE CULTURE RACISM IN AMERICA IT INCLUDES THE ISN'T A COLUMN RACISM SEXISM CLASSISM AND COLORIST. AND I MENTION COLORISM BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT ETHNICITY YOU TALKING ABOUT THERE IS DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH OUTCOMES DIFFERENCE. BASED UPON YOUR SKIN COLOR. THEY WE MIX AND YOU KNOW. HUGE DOSE OF IGNORE AND INTOLERANCE. SOME RELIGIOUS DOGMA AND WE HAVE INGREDIENTS FOR AMERICAN CULTURE BREAKS IT'S EXPRESSED IN FELT DIFFERENTLY DONE SELF ON THE WEST EASE. BUT IT'S ALL GONE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAST HOW DID ALL THIS COME ABOUT. WELL IF WE GO BACK CENTURIES IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS AND EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF J. F. BLUMENBACH WHO WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FATHERS OF- OF PALEONTOLOGY. AND HE TAUGHT IN THE SCIENCE THAT ON. WHITES AND BLACKS WERE DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE WAS A HIERARCHY THAT WHITES WERE ON TOP FOLLOWED BY BLACKS FOLLOWED BY EIGHT. AND THEN YOU COULD MEASURE THE FACIAL ANGLE IN THE SCOPE CAPACITY. AND WROTE ATREUS IS CALLED THE NATURAL ORDER OF HUMAN BEANS DEEMING WHITE SUPERIA FOLLOWED BY BLACKS THE BEGINNING OF DEHUMANISATION SO WE TALK ABOUT RACISM BUT IT'S REALLY DEHUMANISATION. THERE WAS A PHYSICIAN BY THE NAME GEORGE KOFI WHO IS A FRENCH WAS ISSUED IN PARIS WHO TAUGHT MANY. AMERICAN PHYSICIANS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT COOPERATING- WAS INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING A AFRICAN A LADY THAT WAS COAST FROM SOUTH AFRICA TO EUROPE. THEY PARADED HER AROUND LIKE AN ANIMAL HER NAME WAS TO TEACH APARTMENT PART OF THE COCHON TRY. AND HE WAS TRYING TO PROVE THAT HER BODY HABITAT. WAS INFERIOR IN CLOSE TO EIGHT HE FOLLOWED HER AROUND UNTIL SHE DIED. TOOK A BODY PART TO PUT HIM ON DISPLAY IN THE MUSEUM OF PARIS. WHERE THEY STAYED UNTIL- MANDELA BECAME PRESIDENT. AND ASKED FOR HER RETURNS TO GET A PROPER BURIAL. WE HAVE DOCTOR SAM PART RIGHT BUT SAM CARTWRIGHT WAS A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHICH WAS THE FIRST MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY EVEN BEFORE HARVEY VERY PRESTIGIOUS. HE ARE GRADUATED FROM THE ANY WENT TO A SCHOOL DOWN IN. NEW WALLETS IN UGH IN NEW ORLEANS HIS. TITLED WAS PROFESSOR OF DISEASES OF INTEGRAL IN THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA. SO BLACK FOLKS WERE SPECIALTY NOW DURING THIS TIME THEY WERE SLAVES AND THEY WERE TREATED AS PROPERTY. THE SLAVE OWNERS WERE HAVING A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY. THEY WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY HE DID A STUDY. TO FIND OUT WHY THAT WAS HAPPENING HE WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE BOSE MEDICAL JOURNAL DECLARING THAT THE REASON WHY THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY IS BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED WITH THEM MENTAL DISEASE CALLED DRAKE DAMANIA RUN AWAY MATT. AND WHEN THIS LEYVA SAID YEAH BUT- I HIT THE TREATMENT WAS CONDESCENSION HIM A LITTLE TIME OFF DANCE ON SUNDAYS. AND INSPIRED TO DO AND THAT SOME OF THEM STILL RAN AWAY AND HE SAID A HA THOSE SLAVES HAVE ANOTHER MENTAL PROBLEM CALLED JUSTICE DIGIT AETHIOPICA. REBELLIOUSNESS NOW TOOK ME FIFTY YEARS TO FIND OUT WHAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. BUT THE TREATMENT FOR THAT WAS MEDICAL WITH THE- HE WITH THE DEVIL OUT OF THEM THIS WAS A PHYSICIAN AND THAT WAS HIS TREATMENT WE HAVE DOCTOR SENT SAMUEL MORTON WHO WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHO TAUGHT THE THEORY OF CRANEY OLOGY. IN UP OUR PHRENOLOGY MEASURING THE SKULL CAPACITY. THE FIRST EUROCENTRIC IQ TEST STATING THAT BLACKS WERE INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY HAD A SMALLER SCOPE CAPACITY THIS IS BEING TAUGHT IN THE UCS IN AND A MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE GOT DR JOSHUA NOT WHO IS ALSO A PHYSICIAN. AND LECTURER IN A SLAVE OWNER AND HE TAUGHT THE THEORY OF RICK WROTE ABOUT CALLED NUMEROLOGY IN WHICH SHE TAUGHT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES. IN THE WE HAVE. DOCTOR J. MARION SIMS HE'S CONSIDERED THE FATHER OF GYNECOLOGY. WHO OPERATED ON BLACKS AND POOR WHITES TO DEVELOP A SURGICAL PROCEDURE WITHOUT. THE AID OF ANESTHESIA. THESE ARE JUST A FEW THERE WAS A BOOK WRITTEN BY HARRIET WASHINGTON CALLED MEDICAL APARTHEID THAT DOCUMENTED DOZENS AND DOZENS OF IN HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION. ON BLACKS THROUGHOUT SENTRIES SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TO SKI IT'S ABOUT A- LEGACY AND HISTORY OF- EXPERIMENTATION. SO MONDAYS ARE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN. NINETIES LITERATURE STARTED PUBLISHING OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR BLACKS AND HISPANICS. AND THEY USED TO SAY WELL WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHY IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT GENETICS MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH- POOR COMMUNICATION. THIS WAS A STUDY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THESE WITH THE ACT WHAT ACTUAL PARTICIPANTS THESE WERE ALL ACTORS WHO DRESSED UP LIKE PATIENTS THEY ALL HAD A SCRIPT EXACTLY THE SAME. THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS INTERVIEWED THEM AND IN THE END I ASKED WHAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS PHYSICIANS WELL TRAINED IN THIS COUNTRY THEY CAME UP WITH THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE THEN THEY ASK WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT IN FOR SOME REASON. FOR THE BLACK PATIENTS SIXTY PERCENT. OF THESE PHYSICIANS RECOMMENDED THE PROPER TREATMENT LASTS FOR BLACKS THAN FOR WHITES. SO THAT PROMPTED. US STUDY BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. COATS I NEED FOR TREATMENT THIS WAS ONE OF THE STUDIES THEY LOOKED AT TWO HUNDRED TO OTHER STUDIES. DOCUMENTING THAT YES I NEED- TREATMENT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN IS ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED BY PHYSICIANS. SO WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF RACES. THERE IS A VIDEO THAT GOES WITH THIS I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE INTERNET THIS CALL CREATORS FOR CHANGE BUT THEY TALK ABOUT THE SIDE TO RACES. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND DECIDES WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND COLLECTED TRUMP. WHAT IS COLLECTIVE TRAUMA IT'S A COMBINATION OF ETHNO HISTORIC TRAUMAS SUCH AS THAT SEEN WITH BLACKS IN SLAVERY NATIVE AMERICANS WITH GENOCIDE. THE HOLOCAUST X. CENTER MIX THAT WITH INTERGENERATIONAL RACISM AND CULTURAL DISCRIMINATION. AND THE SCIENCE CONCEPT OF EPIGENETICS WHICH IS BIOLOGY IN A MIXING WITH ENVIRONMENT THAT EXPRESSES JIM DIFFERENTLY AND WE WIND UP WITH MULTI GENERATIONAL SOCIAL INEQUITIES IN HEALTH DISPARITIES. HOW IS THAT MANIFEST PAST AND CURRENT EVENTS THAT INCREASE- INDIVIDUAL COLLECTIVE TOXIC STRESS OF CAUSING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- IN THE BEGINNING. I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS ABLE TO SHOW THE ORIGINAL SLIDE BUT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. THE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECLARED RACISM A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HERE IN- SAN DIEGO. ONE RESEARCH IS IN THIS AREAS DR DAVID WILLIAMS HE'S AT THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES HE'S PUBLISHED IN THIS IS JUST ONE HE PUBLISHED TALKING ABOUT STRESS PATHWAYS THAT CAUSE DISCRIMINATION AND AFFECT YOUR HEALTH. ANY TALK ABOUT FIRST EXPOSURE TO STRESS GIVES RISE TO NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL STATES GENERATING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ADVERSELY AFFECT HEALTH SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. AND THEN BEHAVIORAL COPING RESPONSES TO MANAGE STRESS LEADING TO UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORS SUCH AS- DRUGS CIGARETTES ALCOHOL ABUSE AND POOR LIFESTYLE HABITS. IN THIRD THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC STRESS CAN LEAD TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SYSTEM CHANGES PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT CAN CAUSE DISEASE. I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT TO CONCEPTS ONE IS AT THE BOTTOM ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES CALLED ACES AND THE OTHERS OUR STATIC GLOW WHICH TO CHRONIC PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE THAT YOUR BODY HAS TO LESS STRESS. AND WHEN THEY HAVE DONE STUDIES THEY'RE NOW FINDING OUT THAT ONE OF THE FIRST- STUDIES OF ACES WAS ACTUALLY DONE HERE IN. SAN DIEGO AND THEY FOUND THAT THE MORE ADVERSE EVENT YOU HAD TO OUR CHILDHOOD. THE GREATER NUMBER OF DISEASES YOU HAD WHEN YOU OWED INCLUDING DIABETES AS MERRICK CETERA. THEY LOOKED AT IT BY RACE AND ETHNICITY BLACKS HISPANICS HAVE HIGH SCORES IN HIGH ALLOSTERIC LOAD LEVELS THEN ALL OF THE ETHNICITIES THIS CONTRIBUTES TEXAS DISEASE BURDEN SHORTER LIFE EXPECTANCIES SIX CETERA. THIS IS JUST. AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT DEPENDED UPON THE NUMBER OF FACES AND YOU GO ACROSS ONE TWO THREE FOUR ACES YOU CAN SEE THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE. IN THE- NUMBER OF EVENTS THAT HAPPEN LATER ON IT LIKE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS INJECTION OF DRUGS ALCOHOL ABUSE DEPRESSION LUNG DISEASE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE X. CETERA. AND HOW IS POSTULATED TO WORK IS THAT THESE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES LEAD TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. ADOPTION OF HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS THAT RESULT IN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES CAUSING DISEASE DISABILITY SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND EARLY DEATH. WHAT IS OUR STATIC LOW. I LIST THE CONCEPT AVAILABLE SPACES IS HOW WE INTERNALIZE OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE MEASURE IT BY WHAT WE CALL ALICE STATIC. INVESTOR CHRONIC INSIDIOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS CAUSING WEAR AND TEAR ON THE BODY ORGANS LEADING TO DISEASE AND AS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE MANY OF THE NEGATIVE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. INCREASE OUR STATIC LOW. VIOLENCE POOR HOUSING LACK OF SOCIAL CAPITAL FOR EMPLOYMENT POVERTY AND YES RACISM. NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST HERE IN AMERICA MANY OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE RACIALIZED WE GOT STRUCTURAL RACIAL RACISM WHICH STRUCTURAL. AND RACIALIZED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH LITERATURE IN IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LITERATURE THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES NOW COMING OUT TALKING ABOUT DALLAS LOAD AND HOW IT'S MEASURED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THIS WAS ONE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN WHICH THEY MEASURED ALLOSTERIC LOAD ARE NOT IN WHITES VERSUS BLACKS SOME OF THE PRIMARY STRESS BIOMARKERS INCLUDE. ENZYMES AND- PROTEINS SEARCHES- CORTISOL CATECHOLAMINE ANGIOTENSIN ENDOTHELIUM. AND SOME OF THE SECONDARY WAYS YOU CAN GET THAT THESE INCREASE INSIDES IS MEASURING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE YES GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN WHICH IS A. ONE C. A MEASURE OF EARLY DIABETES. LIPID LEVELS YOUR WAIST TO HIP RATIO ALBUMIN EXETER THESE ALL CLINICAL- BIOLOGICAL WAYS OF MEASURING ALICE STATIC LOW AND WHEN THEY DID THE STUDIES THEY FOUND THAT BLACKS AT HIGHER OUT OF A STATIC LOAD AND WIPED. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE BLACK POPULATION WHEN THEY LOOK AT HISPANICS ASIANS WHITE SIX CETERA BLACKS WITH THE ONLY ONES TO HAVE BLACK FEMALES HAVE HIGHER I WAS STATUS QUO. THE BLACK. MALES I WAS THAT. WE LOOK AT YOU ESTIMATE IN MATTEL RATES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. WE CAN SEE THAT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS MATERNAL RATE IS TWO TO THREE SOMETIMES FOUR TIMES HIGHER. THAN HISPANIC IN. A WHITE POPULATIONS IN THE SAME FOR INFANT MORTALITY. AND THIS GOES ON YES AS THE- SOCIAL INCOME IMPROVES WITH THE JOB STATUS IMPROVES. THE INFANT MORTALITY AND MATERNAL RATES GO DOWN BUT WHEN WE COMPARE BLACKS TO THE SAME CLASS WE STILL SEE EVEN IT UP INCOME- OF BLACK MOTHERS AND WHAT NOT THIS DISPARITIES SO RACES INDEPENDENT FACTOR AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT ALICE STATIC LOAD. IN CHRONIC INTERMENT STRESS THAT BLACK WOMEN GO THROUGH. HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. NINE TWO ZERO THREE SEVEN ROYAL. NINE ONE NINE ONE FIVE IS HE SAN DIEGO A BABY BORN IN THOSE ZIP CODES HAS A LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH OF EIGHTY FIVE YEARS IN EIGHTY YEARS. AT 921-149-2115 IS THE AREA WHERE I PRACTICE MEDICINE ITSELF THE SAN DIEGO AND THE LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH FOR A BABY BORN AND THAT ERROR IS SEVENTY NINE AND SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS. JUST BECAUSE WHERE YOU BELONG SO PLACE. HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTED TO YELP. IF WE LOOK AT RACE. AND LONGEVITY THE OVERALL H. OF LONGEVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTY EIGHT POINT SIX HOWEVER IF WE LOOK AT ASIANS WHO WAS EIGHTY SIX POINT FIVE HISPANICS EIGHTY TWO POINT EIGHT WHITE SEVENTY EIGHT POINT NINE NATIVE AMERICAN SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE IN BLACK SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX SO ALL MINORITIES ARE NOT THE SAME SO YOU MAY ASK WHY ARE BLACKS AND NATIVE AMERICANS HELLO. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT HISTORY K. THAT COLLECTIVE TRAUMA THAT TOOK PLACE IT'S PUT THAT TRAUMA IN ALICE THAT EXPLODE HAS BEEN GOING ON MUCH LONGER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEN IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. WHAT'S TAKING PLACE TODAY IN WHAT WE SEE IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE CHANGES IN THOSE NUMBERS IT IS GETTING WORSE BECAUSE OF THAT OUT NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC LOW THIS TAKING PLACE THERE. IN IN SUMMARY HOW DOES THE INTERACTION OF GENES AND ENVIRONMENT TAKE PLACE. ON ON THE REF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESTIMATE CONTRIBUTION TO DISEASE WE SAY ABOUT 25% MAYBE BIOLOGY LIFESTYLE GREATER THAN 50% ENVIRONMENT 12% IN THE MEDICAL CARE 10% SO 10% YET WE SPEND 90% OF OUR MONEY ON MEDICAL CARE. AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON LIFESTYLE. AND LIFESTYLE ITSELF. IS INFLUENCED BY OUR ENVIRONMENT INTERACTS WITH OUR GENES SO IT'S EASY TO SAY FOR SOMEBODY IN LA HOYA I WANT YOU TO JOG YOU'RE A PERSONAL TRAINER ITSELF THE SAN DIEGO IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THE ENVIRONMENT NOT MAY NOT BE SAFE SO YOU HAVE ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCES ARE YOUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE A HEALTHY. LIFESTYLE AND THEN YOU THROW THE EPIGENETICS IN THERE WHICH IS. NOT THAT THERE'S A- NIGGLE GENE MAKE IN US HYPERTENSIVE. YES THE ENVIRONMENT AND RACISM AND STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. LEADING TO A MODIFICATION OF GENE EXPRESSION RATHER THAN ALTERATION IN THE CODE ITSELF. AND THIS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU THE IMPACT OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THIS IS SAYING THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF WHITE WAS SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT YEARS HISPANICS EIGHTY ONE POINT EIGHT YEARS AND BLACKS SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE YEARS WITH THE ONSET OF CODE VIA I THINK THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE FIRST SIX EIGHT MONTHS. THERE WAS A DECREASE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES LOCKED THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR AMERICANS HOWEVER THE LOS FOUR WHITES WAS ONLY POINT EIGHT YEARS THE LOSS FOR HISPANICS WAS ONLY ONE POINT NINE YEARS IN THE LOS FOUR AFRICAN AMERICANS WAS TWO POINT SEVENTY. SO IN SUMMARY. WHY DID NOT COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES TO CLEAR RACISM A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AS A RESULT OF HISTORIC AND CURRENT RACISM BIAS DISCRIMINATION RACE AND ETHNICIT ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO MOST OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHICH INCLUDE STE YOUR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS THAT HELPS YOU WITH EMPOWERMENT IN INFLUENCE WHERE YOU LIVE. YOUR JOB SATUS DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO- HEALTH IN QUALITY HEALTHCARE QUALITY HEALTHY FOOD AND OUR AYE YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO MORE TOXINS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR HOOD AS USUAL- YOU HAVE. TAKING US TO CHURCH SCHOOL AND ALL OF THAT IN ONE I. ALWAYS ENJOY LEARNING AND LISTENING FROM YOUR VAST- WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE YOUR PASSION TO NOT ONLY EDUCATING- THOSE OF US IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION BUT THOSE OF US IN THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO YOUR PATIENCE- OVER THE DECADES THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEDICINE- DEFINITELY BEEN NOTICED AND YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL AND- TO HAVE YOU HERE WITH AND SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY- THAT WAS AN AMAZING HISTORY LESSON. JUST REMIND US THAT WHERE WE ARE TODAY DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT THAT THIS'S BEEN UNFORTUNATELY EMBEDDED AND AMERICAN HISTORY FOR GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS AND IF WE DO NOT TRULY BECOME INTENTIONAL ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THEM AND DEALING WITH THEM. THEN WE WILL BE DOOMED TO CONTINUE TO REPEAT HISTORY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT'S ALWAYS AN INTERESTING TO ME HOW PEOPLE LIKE TO. BUT CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS ON GENES OR GENETICS- WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO COME HERE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS OFTEN CHANGE VERSUS THOSE IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY TO THEIR NATIVE LANDS. AND IT WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO I HAD TO REMIND SOMEONE ON A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE THAT I MIND THAT IT'S NOT THE GENES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOKAT- THOSE WHO LIVE IN AFRICA YOU REMEMBER. WHAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS INITIALLY EIGHT IT WAS FROM THE LAND IT WAS THAT THE HEALTHY VEGETABLES AND FRUITS BUT IT- BUT WHEN YOU ADD THE STRESS AND THE POOR CONDITIONS AND THE POOR DIETS AND- THE FOOD IN A CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT. OVER TIME WHERE YOU GET THE HIGHER RATES OF DIABETES OBESITY HYPERTENSION COPD ASTHMA AND ALL OF THAT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR REMINDING US HOW WE GOT HERE- SO THAT WE CAN BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT STAY HERE.

SO LASTLY WE HAVE THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY DR ELIZABETH HERNANDEZ. DR HERNANDEZ OVERSEAS PHS OPERATIONS WHICH INCLUDES TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL AND REFUGEE HEALTH. REPAIRED NIS AND RESPONSE MATERNAL CHILD AND FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES HIV SLASH AIDS STI AND HEPATITIS AS WELL AS THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND IMMUNIZATION BRANCH. SHE PROVIDES DIRECTION AND OPERATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN THE AREAS OF BUDGET DEVELOPMENT FISCAL PROCESSES AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CONTRACTING QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT BOARD LETTER COORDINATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES I THOUGHT. THE PHS DEPARTMENT CONSISTS OF OVER SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EMPLOYEES AND A BUDGET OF OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SERVING A COUNTY OF ALMOST THREE POINT FOUR MILLION RESIDENTS. I AM SO APPRECIATIVE OF HER JOINING US TODAY AND I WILL NOW TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO DOCTOR ELIZABETH HERNANDEZ. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WEBER. REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAKS WITH YOU TODAY- AS THE OTHERS SPEAKERS I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HEALTH AND TO PROVIDE A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- AND FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN- AS THE OTHERS SPEAKERS IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- I THINK THE OTHER SPEAKERS ALSO. SPOKE ABOUT THIS VERY WELL AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IMPACTS RESILIENCY WE KNOW THAT IMPACTS HEALTH EQUITY- BUT A PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE WE GET TO ASK THE QUESTIONS OF WHY DO CERTAIN HEALTH. OUTCOMES EXIST. AND MORE AND THE MORE WE ASKED THAT QUESTION THE MORE WE ASK WHY WHY WHY AND WE END UP PEELING IT BACK TO YOU SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AT PLAY. AND AGAIN THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION JOB STATUS FAMILY SOCIAL SUPPORT THE OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. AS WE LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HEALTH WE SEE THAT NOT EVERY PERSON HAVE THE SAME CONDITIONS AND THESE CONDITIONS EXPLAIN IN PART WHY SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE HEALTHIER THAN OTHERS AND WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE GENERALLY ARE NOT AS HEALTHY AS IT COULD BE. THE NATURE OF OUR WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH RELIES HEAVILY ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. MOST OF MY PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS ON HOW THE COUNTY USES A COLLECTIVE IMPACT APPROACH TO MEASURE AND IMPROVE SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HEALTH AND INCREASE HEALTH AWARENESS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH A HEALTH EQUITY LENS. WE START WITH THE THREE FOUR FIFTY MODEL BASED ON THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION THREE FOUR FIFTY MODEL THE COUNTY FOCUSES ON THREE BEHAVIORS. THIS INCLUDES POOR DIET LACK OF EXERCISING AND SMOKING AND WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERSTHAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DIRECTLY IMPACT THE THREE BEHAVIORS. THESE THREE BEHAVIORS LEAD TO FOR CHRONIC DISEASES CANCER HEART DISEASE STROKE TYPE TWO DIABETES AND LUNG DISEASE WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO MORE THAN HALF OF THE DEATHS IN SAN DIEGO EACH YEAR. CHRONIC DISEASES MAKE UP THE EIGHT OF THE TEN LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN FACT IN THE YEAR OF COUNTY WERE DUE TO THESE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES. IF YOU LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE SEVENTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES PARTS OF CENTRAL SOUTHEAST AND NORTH CENTRAL REGIONS. THESE REGIONS HAVE SIMILAR PERCENTAGES IN TERMS OF DEATH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOUTH REGION. IN SOUTH REGION 67% OF DEATHS WERE DUE TO THESE CHRONIC DISEASES. MEANING THAT IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. TWO OUT OF THREE SOUTH REGION RESIDENTS DIED AS A RESULT OF ONE OF THE THREE FOUR FIFTY DISEASES. BY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS HAD DROPPED TO ONE OUT OF TWO. WELL THIS IS NOT STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE HOW YOU BEGAN TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIS. AND WE BEGIN WITH LOOKING AT OUR DATA. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO GET TO THE WHY. WE BEGAN TO CONDUCT DEEPER DIVES INTO OUR DATA. OUR COMMUNITY HOSTED TO STICKS UNIT CREATED ONLINE COMMUNITY PROFILES FOR PUBLIC USE. THESE PROFILES AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN CAN BE ACCESSED ON OUR INTERNET. FROM THE COLLECTIVE IMPACT PERSPECTIVE MANY OF OUR PARTNERS HAVE REACHED OUT TO US TO RECEIVE THIS TYPE OF DATA. AND NOW IT IS ONLINE FOR THEM TO USE AT THEIR LEISURE. THE PROFILES INCLUDE FIVE DASHBOARDS EACH SHOWING THE DIFFERENT LENSES OF HEALTH EQUITY. SUCH AS GEOGRAPHY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. RACE ETHNICITY AGE GROUP GENDER. AND A SUMMARY SLIDE SHOWING ALL FIVE LENSES IN ONE SINGLE SLIDE. SO HOW THIS WORKS IS THE USER SELECTS A HEALTH CONDITION FROM A DROP DOWN LIST. AS WELL AS THE OUTCOME AND YOU CAN SEE THAT'S OPEN FOR IN PURPLE. WELCOME COULD BE DEATH HOSPITALIZATION EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SKILLED NURSING INPATIENT TREATMENT AND PHYSICAL REHAB. THE RATES ARE DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD AND IF YOU HOVER OVER THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA A POP UP WILL DISPLAY THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THE RATES AND THE COUNT OF THE DISEASE. FOR EXAMPLE ON THIS SLIDE ASTHMA IS A CONDITION WITH THE OUTCOMES OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DISCHARGES. THE LIGHT BLUE SHOWS LOWER RATES FOLLOWED BY DARKER AREAS FOR HIGHER RATES. HERE CENTRAL AND EAST REGIONS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF ANOTHER CONDITION CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASE HERE AGAIN EAST REGION CONTINUES TO SHOW THE HIGH STREET FOLLOWED BY CENTRAL. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO DO A DEEPER DIVE ON ANY REGION THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS- A DEEPER DIVE IN CENTRAL REGION AND WE CAN SEE THAT SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO HAS THE HIGHEST RATE AMONG THE SUBREGIONAL AREAS IN THE AREA OF CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASE. FIVE I SHARED EARLIER WE CAN ALSO FILTER THE DATA BY GENDER THIS SLIDE SHOWS HEART DISEASE AS THE CONDITION AND DEATH AS THE OUTCOME. WE CAN SEE FROM THIS SLIDE UP THE DEATH THE DEATH FROM HEART DISEASE IS HIGHER AMONG MEN AND WOMEN IN ALL SUB REGIONAL AREAS IN CENTRAL SAN DIEGO. HOWEVER THE RATES FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WERE HIRE IN SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO THEN THE REGION OR THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE. THIS DASHBOARD SHOWS ASTHMA RATES AND LEMON GROW BY ALL LENSES OF HEALTH EQUITY. BASED ON THIS DATA WE CAN SEE THAT UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA RATES ARE HIGHEST AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN. THIS WAS JUST A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THE ONLINE PROFILES THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR AND THE ALL TO TAILOR INTERVENTIONS INTERVENTIONS AND SERVICES TO PACIFIC POPULATIONS. SO HOW DOES THE COUNTY USE THIS DATA TO BEGIN TO MOVE THE NEEDLE FROM THE BEGINNING. IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE NEED A STRATEGY TO PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH. HOWEVER AS A BLUEPRINT FOR LIVE WELL SAN DIEGO TOOK SHAPE WE ALSO REALIZE IT WAS GOING TAKE MORE THAN A SINGULAR AIM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WE'RE SEEING IN OUR REGION. AS A RESULT THE BOSTON DIEGO HAS THREE COMPONENTS FOCUSING ON THREE ELEMENTS OF WELL BEING HEALTHY. SAFE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE OR BUILDING BETTER HEALTH LIVING SAFELY AND THRIVING RESPECTIVELY. ALL COUNTY SAN DIEGO'S PROGRAMS PRACTICES POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS SUPPORT LEVEL SAN DIEGO. THE THREE COMPONENTS BUILDING BETTER HEALTH LIVING SAFELY IN THRIVING AND BODY THE VISION OF LEVELS AND DIEGO WHICH INCLUDES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND INDICATORS TO TRACK OUTCOMES. THE STRATEGIC APPROACHES WHICH ARE NOTED IN GREEN INCLUDE BUILDING A BETTER SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM SUPPORTING THE POSITIVES CHOICES PRESERVING POLICIES SYMPTOM AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND IMPROVING THE CULTURE FROM WITHIN. SUCCESS IS MEASURED THROUGH FIVE AREAS OF INFLUENCE AND TEN INDICATORS THESE TEN INDICATORS AND BLUE ARE COMPONENTS OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED RECOGNIZE LEVEL PARTNERS ACROSS FOUR SECTORS GOVERNMENTS BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST ACHIEVE COMMON AND MUTUAL GOALS. SO NOW THAT WE HAVE A VISION AND A FRAMEWORK YOU RELIED ON THE POWER OF COLLECTIVE IMPACT WHICH INCLUDES FIVE COMPONENTS A COMMON AGENDA. SHARED MEASUREMENTS MUTUAL REINFORCING ACTIVITIES CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION AND BACK ONE SUPPORT. LEVEL SAN DIEGO USES A COLLECTIVE IMPACT STRATEGY ACHIEVING A HEALTHY SAFE AND THRIVING SAN DIEGO COUNTY INVOLVES EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS THE SAME VISION HERE WE APPLY THE FIVE CONDITIONS OF COLLECTIVE IMPACT. NUMBER ONE COMMON AGENDA THIS IS OUR LEVEL SAN DIEGO FRAMEWORK THAT YOU SAW IN EIGHT INDIA TRIANGLE. NUMBER TWO SHARED MEASUREMENTS FIVE AREAS OF INFLUENCE AND THE TOP TEN INDICATORS THE SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HEALTH. NUMBER THREE MUTUALLY REINFORCING ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON FOCUSING ON ON RECOGNIZING OUR PARTNERS. FOR CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION WHICH FOCUSES ON VARIOUS EVENTS CONTRACTS TELLER BRIEFINGS. A NUMBER FIVE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION HELPS MOBILIZE COORDINATE AND FACILITATE WHICH IS THE COUNTY'S ROLE IN THIS COLLECTIVE IMPACT IN SIMPLEST TERMS WE CAN DO MORE TOGETHER THAN WE COULD EVER DO ALONE WE CAN DO DIFFERENT THINGS THINGS EACH OF US IS BEST AT WHAT CONTRIBUTING TO THE SAME POSITIVE CHANGE. WE CAN STRUCTURE HOW WE'D THE WE DO THINGS TO DROP A RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S EFFORTS AND MEASURE OUR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL AS OUR CUMULATIVE IMPACT. I'D LIKE TO NOW FOCUS ON SHARED MEASUREMENTS AND AGAIN ANOTHER ALL MINE RESOURCE FOR US TO USE DATA ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF LEVEL SAN DIEGO. THIS IS ANOTHER RESOURCE FOR THE PUBLIC AND I LEVEL PARTNERS ON OUR LIVE WELL SAN DIEGO WEBSITE WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL IMPACT REPORTS. AND THEY ARE CATEGORIZED UNDER THE FIVE LOSE INFLUENCE FIVE AREAS OF INFLUENCE AND FUTURE DATA ON THE TENT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THESE REPORTS CAN BE ACCESSED BY ANYONE AND REALLY FILTERED BY CITY. THIS ONE ON THE SLIDE FEATURE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN YEARS. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THE U. S. LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH WAS SIXTY NINE POINT SEVEN YEARS THIS HAS RISEN TO SEVENTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT AT SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IN SAN DIEGO A BABY BORN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WAS EXPECTED TO LIVE SEVENTY SIX POINT SEVEN YEARS. AND THIS LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS SINCE RISEN BY SIX TO EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN YEARS AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WELL LIFE EXPECTANCY IS INCREASING ACROSS THE BOARD THERE IS VARIATION AND ESTIMATES BY COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY REGION. AS MENTIONED EARLIER PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO LIVE LONGER IF THEY'RE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGE GET LITTLE EXERCISE LOOK LIKE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HAS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN YEARS BUT WITHIN THE COUNTY THERE IS CURRENTLY A GAP IN LIFE EXPECTANCY BETWEEN SOME COMMUNITY. IF WE MOVE TO THE SOUTH IN CHULA VISTA. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY DECREASES BY SIX YEARS ALONG WITH EDUCATION AND INCOME. SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND A CLEAR HEALTH DISPARITY FROM THE ZIP CODE PERSPECTIVE. THIS DATA HELPS DIRECT SERVICES TO AREAS WE HAVE. UNDER RESOURCE OVER TIME. IF WE GO BACK TO THE THREE FOUR FIFTY FRAMEWORK WE CAN SEE THAT USING THE COLLECTIVE IMPACT MODEL THE PROPORTION OF DEATHS DUE TO FOR THE FOR CHRONIC DISEASE AND DIEGO COUNTY DROPPED FROM 63% IN 2000250% IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. DESPITE A DECREASE IN THE THREE FOUR FIFTY CHRONIC DISEASES. DISEASE IS STILL THAT HELD 450% OF ALL DEBTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS GRAPH SHOWS A DOWNWARD TREND AMONG ALL REGIONS BUT AGAIN. WITH SOME REGIONS PERFORMING BETTER THAN OTHERS. LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT CENTRAL REGION THE PROPORTIONATE STUDENT THREE FOUR FIFTY CHRONIC DISEASES AND CENTRAL REGION DROPPED FROM 61% NINETEEN. AMONG THIS REGION SUB REGIONAL AREAS SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENT OF DEATHS DUE TO THREE FOUR FIFTY CHRONIC DISEASES AT FIFTY THREE PERCENT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IN THE SOUTH REGION THE PROPORTION THAT STILL THREE FOUR FIFTY CHRONIC DISEASES DROPPED FROM 67% IN 2000251% IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND AGAIN IF YOU DO A DEEPER DIVE SOUTH BAY HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF DEATHS DUE TO THREE FOUR FIFTY CHRONIC DISEASES AT 53% IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AGAIN SHOWING DISPARITIES BETWEEN REGIONS AND EMPHASIZING THAT PLACE DOES MATTER. WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S LOTS MORE WORK TO BE DONE THE COUNTY IS LASER FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN ON HEALTH AND ALL COMMUNITIES. THIS BEGINS WITH OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAVE PUT FORTH A BOLD FRAMEWORK FOR A FUTURE. THE FRAMEWORK PRIORITISES COMMUNITIES A POPULATION SAN DIEGO THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. THROUGH THIS FRAMEWORK THE COUNTY IS FOCUSED ON RACIAL JUSTICE. HEALTH EQUITY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE TO NAME A FEW. WITH THAT THE COUNTY HAS CREATED AND INVESTED IN NEW DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE JUSTICE THE OFFICE OF EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOME SOLUTIONS AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES. ALSO JUST RECENTLY THE COUNTY HAS PUT FORTH AN AUDACIOUS FRAMEWORK FOR ENDING HOMELESSNESS WHICH INCLUDES FIVE STRATEGIC DOMAINS RANGING FROM FOCUSING ON ROOT CAUSE PREVENTION. TO PROVIDING REAL TIME PERMIT HOUSING AND SUPPORT. ADDITIONALLY WE CONTINUE TO TAILOR OUR SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS BASED ON HEALTH PLACES INDEX AS DR- HUNT SPOKE EARLIER. INVESTING IN AREAS THAT HAVE THE LEAST HEALTHY CONDITIONS OR SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HEALTH. THIS WAS A KEY DRIVER IN OUR CODE TO RESPONSE STRATEGY ALONG WITH A- LONG SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY COLLABORATION. AND HAS ALLOWED US TO SAVE LIVES AND ACHIEVE A HIGH VACCINATION RATE IN OUR COUNTY. ALSO FROM A THREE FOUR FIFTY PERSPECTIVE WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES AND PARTNER WITH OTHER MUNICIPALITIES TO DO THE SAME. SIX DIFFERENT TOBACCO PREVENTION POLICIES WERE ADOPTED ACROSS THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVELS. SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND CITIES OF ESCONDIDO AND SAN MARCOS PASS ORDINANCES TO ESTABLISH SMOKEFREE OUTDOOR DINING. THE CITY OF LAMESA PASSED AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH FOR SMOKE FREE OUTDOOR PUBLIC PLACES WELL THE CITY OF SANTEE TOOK ACTION TO ESTABLISH SMOKE FREE PARKS SMOKE FREE TRAILS THIS IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF COLLECTIVE IMPACTS. AND FINALLY WE'RE BEGINNING TO LAUNCH AN IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO DECREASE INFANT MORTALITY RATES AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN INFERENCE. WE KNOW ABOUT THIS DISPARITY. AND THE BLACK AND HEALTH PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN INFANTS AND EAGLE COUNTY. THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IN THIS COUNTY. AND TWO THOUSAND THE RATE WAS FOURTEEN POINT FIVE PER ONE THOUSAND LIVE BIRTHS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE RATE DECREASED TO EIGHT POINT SEVEN. STILL MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE NEWER EFFORTS AROUND ENSURING EQUITY WITHIN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN CONCLUSION. WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE DATA INFORMED EVIDENCE SCIENCE PEOPLE A COMMUNITY POWER AS WELL AS HEALTH EQUITY FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION DR HERNANDEZ. NOW SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS FROM A VERY BROAD- PERSPECTIVE PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. AND SO IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO COME AND PRESENT TO SAY. THAT YES WE HAVE THESE ISSUES HERE RIGHT HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES BASED OFF OF WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE IS- THAT WILL DETERMINE WHAT HEALTH CONDITIONS YOU HAVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND UNFORTUNATELY AS WELL YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY. I'M ALSO VERY- PLEASED TO SEE ALL THAT THE COUNTY HAS BEEN DOING ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS. I DO PRACTICE ON MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT. IS THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO DID DURING THE- THE CODE FAX THEME PANDEMIC WITH THE VACCINATIONS AND THE TESTING. AND THE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT UNIFORM TO MAKE SURE THAT- NO ONE NO COMMUNITY WAS LEFT BEHIND IN TERMS OF TESTING. AND THE ABILITY TO GET VACCINATIONS ALONG WITH EDUCATION AND STYLE. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE DATA WILL SHOW AS YOU CONTINUE TO- IMPLEMENT- EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS IN VERY TARGETED AREAS BASED OFF OF THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE. TO SEE WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE TO SHOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE PLACED IN THE FUNDING- THAT YOU CAN HAVE- POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE VERY BENEFICIAL AND- SHOWN BY DATA IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LYFT EXPECTANCY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- AMAZING PRESENTATION ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. RIGHT HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MORNING. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WHO PARTICIPATED AND MADE THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. WE ARE SO VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU IN THE ROLES TO AMPLIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

I THINK- YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA AND- SOME THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT BUT I DO LOOK AT THE FOR. THE LAST FIFTY FIVE YEARS I'VE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF THE HISTORY THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. AND I HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS BUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK TO BE DONE- OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T EVEN PROBABLY BE HERE WHICH IS. VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO THE ONE THING THOUGH THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT. IS EDUCATION AND THE YOUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. EDUCATING THEM ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR HEALTH. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF NUTRITION. AND SEEING A QUALITY ACROSS THE EDUCATIONAL ALL THE SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO. BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BRING THE- YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF LIKE DRUG AND ALCOHOL. ADDICTION AND SO REALLY THAT IS WHERE YOU REALLY NEED TO FOCUS A LOT OF YOUR ATTENTION IS ON THE EDUCATION IN THE EARLY YEARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT COMMENT I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STARTING FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE AND EDUCATION AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE USED TO LIVE IN ARE CONDUCIVE TO AT HEARING TO THE THINGS THAT WE ARE TEACHING THEM IN SCHOOL SO WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND HEALTHY NUTRITION. THAT THEY DON'T GO HOME AND AREAS WHICH ARE FOOD DESSERTS AND WINE OR TEACHING THEM ABOUT THE DANGERS OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WALK BY- STORES WHICH ADVERTISE CIGARETTES AND ALCOHOL USE EVERY BLOCK ON THE WAY HOME SO I AGREE THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO TEACH IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE LIVING AND ARE NOT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH THEM AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS AND ALSO IN SCHOOL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THAT COMMENT. HI GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU DR WEBER FOR HAVING HAVING US AND FOR INVITING ME SPECIFICALLY IT WAS- EXCELLENT INFORMATION DOCTOR HOOD THE HISTORICAL DATA WAS. AWESOME I MEAN IT WAS MY MOUTH WAS OPEN BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU PULLED UP SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. WHICH NEEDS TO GO DEEPER INTO THE COMMUNITY- MY NAME IS BARRY POLLARD I RUN THE URBAN COLLABORATIVE PROJECT AND WE FOCUS IN ON. SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO. AND SO I'M GOING TO BRING THE TOPIC BACK DOWN TO WHERE I LIVE. AND ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY IS DOING A REMARKABLE JOB ON A COUNTY WIDE I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE ACTIVITY IN THE CENTRAL REGION. I'M ALSO THE CO LEADER OF THE CENTRAL REGION SO BARBARA JIMENEZ AND I ARE WORKING ON THAT. WITH THE END RESULT OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE COUNTY AND THAT. TYPE OF- MODEL THAT'S BEEN USED TO ADDRESS I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT. I THINK OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE OLD STANDARD DEFINITION OF INSANITY AND KEEP. DOING THE SAME THINGS. AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. FELL THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED THAT IT WAS VERY REFRESHING TO HEAR FROM THE STATE LEVEL. THAT WE WERE STARTING TO FOCUS IN ON THESE. DISPARITIES BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED. SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO STILL TO LOOK AT THAT WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR OFFICE CONTINUED SUPPORT- AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS YEAR- I WITH THIS INFORMATION AND THIS TO GET INTO THE COMMUNITY IN SOUTHEASTERN SAN DIEGO BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TODAY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY- VALUABLE.
