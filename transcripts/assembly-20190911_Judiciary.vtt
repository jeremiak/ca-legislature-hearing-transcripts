CALIFORNIA FOR GETTING A RECORD.

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:52.050
IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY

PROHIBITION AGAINST USING

THAT ALARMED ME A LITTLE BIT

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:08.673
CAN YOU TELL US WHY THAT WAS

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.974

SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM HERE. WITH

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.547
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:17.048
DOING REMOTE REPORTING AND

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:19.083
UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALWAYS THE

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.852
TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:23.054
OFTENTIMES IT HAS JUST BEEN.

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.122
CONFERENCE LINES OVER REGULAR

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:26.558
TOOK TELEPHONY LINES. THAT ARE

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:28.226
SUBJECT TO FAIL AND IF THAT'S

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.661
WHAT'S BEING RELIED ON IT'S NOT

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:30.862
GOING TO WORK WE WANT TO BE

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.530
VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE SETTING

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:35.533
UP A PILOT. AND SETTING. POLICY

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.168
FOR MOVING FORWARD IF WE'RE

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:37.902
GOING TO MOVE IN THIS

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:41.039
DIRECTION. AND TO HAVE OTHER

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:43.208
COUNTIES OR NOT HAVE CONTROL

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.476
OVER HOW THIS HAPPENS AND

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.579
ENSURING THE QUALITY. WHICH IS

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:48.780
POTENTIALLY THE PATH WE'VE BEEN

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.615
HEADED DOWN IT IS NOT GOING TO

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:51.583
GIVE US THE DATA THAT WE

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.084
ABSOLUTELY NEED THIS BUT AS YOU

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.586
WELL KNOW. A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:55.653
OVER THE YEARS IN THIS

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.921
COMMITTEE HAS SEEN IT AGAIN AND

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:57.889
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WHAT WE'VE

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.525
DONE. IS SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED A

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:04.362
VERY NARROW. PROGRAM HERE WITH

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.930
SIGNIFICANT BOUNCE AROUND IT SO

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.632
THAT WE CAN CONTROL THAT WE CAN

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.099
WORK WITH THE AFFECTED

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:09.467
EMPLOYEES HERE WE CAN WORK WITH

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.970
THE COURTS. AND SAID AN

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:12.937
APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR BEING

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:15.173
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. SUPPORT

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.874
OF THAT EFFORT AND THAT'S WHY I

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:17.475
THINK THE PILOT PROGRAM IS A

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.978
WONDERFUL IDEA NOT AN OCTAVE I

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.412
SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT. ALL

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.681
THE CONTROVERSY AROUND IT BUT-

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:24.882
I'M I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:26.484
AROUND WHY WE WOULD ESTABLISH

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:27.785
THE STATUTORY PROHIBITION

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.088
AGAINST IT NOW. YOU KNOW BEFORE

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:31.756
THE PILOT PROGRAM IS RUNNING I

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:32.357
MEAN IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.658
THAT WHAT THE PILOT PROGRAM RUN

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.460
ITS COURSE. HAVE

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:36.094
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.196
OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEN.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:39.564
ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:40.765
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT IS

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.734
ALLOWED WITH LOCAL BEFORE COURT

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.735
REPORTING AND NOT AND WHAT IS

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.570
NOT ALLOWED. RATHER THAN YOU

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:46.938
KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:47.872
IS GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:49.207
OTHER SIDE SAYING OUTSIDE OF

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:50.008
THOSE BULLETS PILOT PROGRAMS.

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:51.876
NO ONE COULD DO ANY REMOTE ROCK

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.211
COURT REPORTING AT ALL SO I'M

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:54.078
