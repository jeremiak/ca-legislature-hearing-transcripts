WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. THE

SAFE HARBOR KICKS IN IT THERE'S

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.228
THREE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:11.132
AMENDED THEY CAN EITHER. DO LAW

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:11.932
ENFORCEMENT IF THAT'S

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:12.600
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:14.235

WITNESSED SOMETHING VIOLENT YOU

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.838
WOULD WANT THEM TO CALL NINE ONE

01:36:17.905 --> 01:36:18.772
ONE WANT THE WANT LAW

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:22.276
ENFORCEMENT TO BE INVOLVED TO DE

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:22.877
ESCALATE SITUATION- YOU DON'T

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.178
WANT THE TROUBLE WE'RE HAVING

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:25.546
AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IT

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.780
WITH THE ACLU I THINK WE'RE-

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:28.182
WE'RE- WE'RE IMPROVING THE BILL

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.650
AS WE GO- YOU DON'T WANT A

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.352
SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:31.952
WITNESSES SOMETHING VIOLENT.

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:33.754
THAT IS TRAFFICKING RELATED THEY

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:35.856
CALL NINE ONE ONE APPROPRIATELY

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:38.626
BUT NOBODY CALLS THE TIP LINE OR

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:39.627
THE VICTIM SERVICES CENTER AND

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:41.328
ALL THE SUDDEN. THE HOTEL OR

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:42.863
MOTELS EXPOSED TO LIABILITY

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.265
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO MANDATE

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.633
THAT YOU CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:47.535
THE BILL AS AMENDED YOU CAN CALL

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:49.370
EITHER OF THOSE THREE OPTIONS

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:50.871
OUR HOPE IS THAT THE FIRST CALL.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:51.972
IF THERE'S NO VIOLENCE GOING ON

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.707
WOULD BE TO THE TIP LINE OR

01:36:53.774 --> 01:36:55.376
WOULD BE TO THE VICTIM SERVICES

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.243
CENTER- I THINK THAT'S

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:58.712
SOMETHING. THE IT LINKS UP WITH

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.014
THE TRAINING THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.916
UNDER NINE SEVENTY SO I THINK IT

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:04.351
MAKES SENSE- BUT I'M GONNA

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:05.819
