THESE THE MISSIONS AS WE WORK TO

00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:26.332 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEM TO PROTECT THE

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:28.634 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH. OF OUR

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:29.735 region:rollup2

WELL THEY GOING TO COVER AIR

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.504 region:rollup2
BASE PLAN TO MEET THE TWENTY

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.939 region:rollup2
THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AS

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:36.642 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THE RECENTLY

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:37.242 region:rollup2
ADOPTED SCHOOL BEING PLAN.

00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:39.178 region:rollup2
WHICH GIVES US THE CHANCE TO

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:40.212 region:rollup2
REVIEW THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:41.447 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE RANGE OF DIRECT

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:42.247 region:rollup2
EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES

00:24:41.447 --> 00:24:43.482 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:45.884 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE FORTY PERCENT

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:47.186 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REDUCTION.

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:48.787 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:49.922 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS OF THE PASS AB THE

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:52.458 region:rollup2
NAME THE EIGHT LAST YEAR.

00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:53.792 region:rollup2
LAST JULY ABOUT AN OVERSUPPLY

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:55.928 region:rollup2
OF ALLOWANCE SAYS AFTER TWENTY

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:58.230 region:rollup2
TWENTY. AND THE IMPACT THAT THIS

00:24:55.928 --> 00:25:00.666 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.201 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF THAT MISSION CAP.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.402 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:04.937 region:rollup2
I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR HOW THE AIR

00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:06.672 region:rollup2
BE WILL MANAGE IT.

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:08.173 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I THINK WE ALL NEED TO

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:10.042 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THEIR HEART

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:11.510 region:rollup2
PRICE CEILING ON ALLOWANCES.

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:13.145 region:rollup2
INDIA THIRTY AIR BE HAVE TO

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.481 region:rollup2
SOLID DECISIONAL MONOPOLY

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:16.148 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES AT THE SAME PRICE.

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:17.282 region:rollup2
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A HARD CAP

00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:19.651 region:rollup2
ON EMISSIONS IN THE CAP AND

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:20.819 region:rollup2
TRADE PROGRAM.

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:21.887 region:rollup2
AND WE MOST LIKELY DID NOT HAVE

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:24.289 region:rollup2
THE MISSION CAPS ON INDIVIDUAL

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:25.424 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.859 region:rollup2
THIS MAKES IT ALL THE MORE

00:25:25.424 --> 00:25:28.394 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP FOCUS ON

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:30.896 region:rollup2
THE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION

00:25:28.394 --> 00:25:31.430 region:rollup2
MEASURES AS A PRIMARY TWELVE TO

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.865 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.932 region:rollup2
TARGET.

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.734 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY ARE BEACON TO NEED

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:37.102 region:rollup2
TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL AND ENHANCE

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:39.271 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO ACHIEVE EMISSION

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:40.773 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:43.008 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ALL THE MORE REASON TO

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:44.777 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:46.378 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. TO

00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:48.847 region:rollup2
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND OUR MOST

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:50.349 region:rollup2
POLLUTED BURNING COMMUNITIES.

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:52.618 region:rollup2
AIR BE AND THEY ARE DISTRICTS

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKES.

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:55.387 region:rollup2
NAY TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:56.989 region:rollup2
CREATIVE AS THEY DEVELOP MASTERS

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:59.058 region:rollup2
TO RESERVE DECADES A NEGLECT IN

00:25:56.989 --> 00:26:00.492 region:rollup2
THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:01.593 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT HAVE

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:03.762 region:rollup2
BEEN TO ELECT A WASTELAND ALL MY

LIFE LONGER.

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:06.532 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD NOT

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:08.434 region:rollup2
BE MAKING MATTERS WORSE RAISING

00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:08.967 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE REVENUE TO FIND

FREEWAYS.

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:13.505 region:rollup2
AS IMPORTANT AS A B. SIX

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:14.706 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN IS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:17.543 region:rollup2
THAT IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:19.078 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION THAT AIR

00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:40.198 region:rollup2
LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:41.600 region:rollup2
HOW WE'VE DONE FIRST OF ALL WITH

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:43.401 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO AIR QUALITY THE THING

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.202 region:rollup2
THAT MOST.

USEPA SETS HEALTH BASED

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:51.476 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND IT'S REQUIRED BY

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:53.278 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW TO REVIEW THOSE

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.880 region:rollup2
STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.214 region:rollup2
ARE. SUFFICIENTLY HEALTH

PROCESS.

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:03.388 region:rollup2
THIS IS LED TO A SERIES OF

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.856 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY STRINGENT STANDARDS

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:06.525 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THAT REFLECT THE

OXIDES OF NITROGEN.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:17.936 region:rollup2
CALLED KNOCKS ARE THE KEY SMOG

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:19.838 region:rollup2
FORMING POLLUTANTS THAT WE ARE

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:21.373 region:rollup2
NOW WORKING TO CONTROL. AND IN

FOR STATIONARY SOURCES.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.341 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCES ARE

00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:58.009 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT

STATEWIDE NUMBERS AND OBVIOUSLY.

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:13.671 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND THAT'S

00:36:52.744 --> 00:36:55.914 region:rollup2
NEVER. COUNTED THEM UP BEFORE WE

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:58.149 region:rollup2
STARTED TO GET READY FOR THIS

00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:59.317 region:rollup2

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:21.206 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL SOURCES

00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:22.941 region:rollup2

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:25.343 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION TO THIS PROGRESS AS

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:27.212 region:rollup2

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:36.888 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:38.656 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO BE

00:37:36.888 --> 00:37:40.758 region:rollup2
PROUD OF IN THESE NUMBERS

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:43.128 region:rollup2
ENTRANCE THE AIR IS CLEANER

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:44.395 region:rollup2

00:37:45.964 --> 00:37:50.535 region:rollup2
AND ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:52.270 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CASES OF ASTHMA HAVE

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
BEEN AVOIDED SINCE NINETEEN

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.073 region:rollup2
NINETY AS WELL.

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.876 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE WHILE OF COURSE

00:37:55.073 --> 00:37:59.511 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO BE

00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:00.245 region:rollup2
THE SIX OR SOMETIMES THE FIFTH

LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:07.051 region:rollup2
BUT TO BE CLEAR THERE IS MUCH

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.087 region:rollup2
WORK AHEAD OF US.

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:10.655 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF

EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATE

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:21.232 region:rollup2
IS TOO HIGH.

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.333 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:24.335 region:rollup2
ARE LOCATED NEAR FREIGHT

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:43.154 region:rollup2
THIS MAPPING TOOL ALLOWS USERS

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:44.856 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY AND COMPARE THE

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:46.891 region:rollup2

REPORTING PROGRAM. USING THIS

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:58.303 region:rollup2
TOOL A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN

00:38:56.034 --> 00:39:00.538 region:rollup2
ZOOM IN AND EXAMINE EMISSIONS

00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:02.574 region:rollup2
WITH IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY.

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:03.875 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VIDEO DEMONSTRATION

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:06.377 region:rollup2
THAT KIDNAPPED THAT WE WANT TO

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:08.713 region:rollup2
SHOW YOU. IN JUST A MINUTE AYE I

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:10.415 region:rollup2
HOPE YOU'LL FIND IT INTERESTING

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:11.983 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE WE SHOW THE VIDEO. I

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:12.817 region:rollup2
WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:39:11.983 --> 00:39:14.786 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND.

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:17.055 region:rollup2
THE EMISSIONS DATA THAT'S USED

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:19.257 region:rollup2
IN THIS TO ALL WAS EXPANDED IN

00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:20.959 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN

00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:22.961 region:rollup2

ANNUAL EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.031 region:rollup2
GASES AS WELL AS CRITERIA. AND

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:29.067 region:rollup2
TOXIC EMISSIONS ON A FACILITY

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:30.702 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR THE LARGEST FACILITIES

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:31.903 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

00:39:30.702 --> 00:39:34.839 region:rollup2
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:39:31.903 --> 00:39:36.207 region:rollup2
DATA ARE COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:38.076 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I COLLECTED THROUGH

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:41.446 region:rollup2
CART WAS MANDATORY REPORTING

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:42.947 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. THE CRITERIA.

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:44.515 region:rollup2
EXCUSE ME THE CRITERIA AND TOXIC

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:46.551 region:rollup2
AIR EMISSIONS DATA ARE COLLECTED

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:49.053 region:rollup2
BY THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:51.956 region:rollup2
IT'S USEFUL DATA BUT IT DOES

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:53.057 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME WEAKNESSES FOR EXAMPLE

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.792 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS USE VARYING

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:56.127 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGIES AND DATA

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:57.929 region:rollup2
COLLECTION PRACTICES FOR

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:59.497 region:rollup2
REPORTING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS

00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:00.798 region:rollup2
AND AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS.

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:02.166 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES EVEN FROM THE SAME

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.835 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:06.070 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON HARMONIZING

00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:08.706 region:rollup2
REPORTING METHODS AS PART OF THE

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:11.042 region:rollup2
AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS BUT WE

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:12.644 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO.

00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:14.679 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT SOME

00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:16.414 region:rollup2
FACILITIES MAY REPORT CRITERIA

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:18.416 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS EVERY THREE YEARS

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:20.218 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF LOCAL AIR DISTRICT

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:22.253 region:rollup2
REPORTING THRESHOLDS. AND AIR

00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:24.422 region:rollup2
TOXIC EMISSIONS ONLY EVERY FOUR

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:26.357 region:rollup2
YEARS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:28.526 region:rollup2
OF THE AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:29.594 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOTSPOTS PROGRAM SO

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:32.030 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN UNEVENNESS IN THE

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:34.465 region:rollup2
DATA. IT'S NOT ALL EQUALLY

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.401 region:rollup2
TIMELY AND AS I SAID THIS I'VE

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:38.002 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES COLLECTED IN USING

00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:40.171 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CRITERIA.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:42.106 region:rollup2
BUT NEVERTHELESS WE THINK THIS

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.274 region:rollup2
TOOL WILL ELP OUT FOR ONE THING

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:45.276 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL CREATE A

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:46.811 region:rollup2
DEMAND FOR MORE DATA AND MORE

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:49.180 region:rollup2
TIMELY DATA.

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:51.783 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL HELP COMMUNITIES TO

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.384 region:rollup2
TRACK TRENDS FROM FACILITIES

00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:55.787 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE SAY AND COMPARE

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:57.288 region:rollup2
UP BY REGION AND BY FACILITY.

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:58.890 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST YEAR WE STARTED

00:40:57.288 --> 00:41:00.425 region:rollup2
COLLECTING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.527 region:rollup2
DATABUS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:04.395 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN SOME FACILITIES HAVE

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:05.063 region:rollup2
SEEN EMISSIONS INCREASES AS

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.331 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA GREW OUT OF ITS

00:41:05.063 --> 00:41:08.132 region:rollup2
RECESSION.

00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:09.901 region:rollup2
WHILE OTHERS

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:11.636 region:rollup2
HAVE A SCENE.

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:12.337 region:rollup2
DECREASES.

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:13.805 region:rollup2
AND.

00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:15.707 region:rollup2
THIS IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT

00:41:13.805 --> 00:41:16.908 region:rollup2
IN OF ITSELF.

00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:18.443 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT EMISSIONS

00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:20.244 region:rollup2
VERY FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:21.813 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WHICH IS

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:23.081 region:rollup2
NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THAT

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.849 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY ECONOMIC

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.850 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL AND REGULATORY FACTORS

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:27.285 region:rollup2
THAT INFLUENCE OF FACILITIES

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.690 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:39.890 region:rollup2
SO I'M. AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.794 region:rollup2
THE.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
AB SIX SEVENTEEN NOW REALLY.

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:48.065 region:rollup2
EXPANDS OUR.

LEVEL.

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:54.438 region:rollup2
IS CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THE FIRST

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:56.073 region:rollup2
AND MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:58.042 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING CRITERIA POLLUTANT

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:59.944 region:rollup2

NINETEEN EIGHTIES.

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:06.684 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON

00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.686 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING ISSUES IN OUR MOST

00:48:06.684 --> 00:48:09.820 region:rollup2
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES.

00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:11.622 region:rollup2
IT ALSO REQUIRES CARP TO DEVELOP

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.890 region:rollup2
A STATE STRATEGY THAT OUTLINES

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:14.925 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO FURTHER REDUCE

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.093 region:rollup2
CRITERIA POLLUTANT AND AIR

TOXICS EMISSIONS IN

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:19.296 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:21.098 region:rollup2
DEVELOP COMMUNITY MONITORING

EMISSIONS REPORTING FROM

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:25.403 region:rollup2
STATIONARY SOURCES. THE BILL

00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:27.671 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZES THAT WHILE THE STATE

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:29.407 region:rollup2
HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:30.941 region:rollup2
AT THE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:32.910 region:rollup2
LEVEL THERE ARE COMMUNITIES

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.678 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE. THAT ARE

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:37.381 region:rollup2
REMAINING DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:38.649 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY POOR AIR QUALITY AND

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:40.851 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS THESE COMMUNITIES

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:43.954 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:45.923 region:rollup2
AND ACTION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:48.626 region:rollup2
IMPROVING THE INVENTORY IS GONNA

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:50.227 region:rollup2
BE A KEY COMPONENT OF ANY NEW

00:48:48.626 --> 00:48:52.163 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT WE WILL BE.

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:54.331 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING.

00:48:52.163 --> 00:48:56.967 region:rollup2
SO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:59.170 region:rollup2
SIX SEVENTEEN REALLY WORK HAND

00:48:56.967 --> 00:49:01.839 region:rollup2
IN HAND TO SUPPORT A FOCUSED

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS APPROACH.

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:05.576 region:rollup2
TO THE MOST IMPACTED

00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:07.845 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. NOW TURNING TO THE

00:49:05.576 --> 00:49:09.246 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN THAT WE ADOPTED AT

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:11.715 region:rollup2
OUR LAST BOARD MEETING.

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:15.386 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN.

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:18.088 region:rollup2
ALSO HARD AT WORK IN DEVELOPING

00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:20.457 region:rollup2
AND UPDATING AND IMPLEMENTING.

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:22.259 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCOPING PLAN

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:24.195 region:rollup2
THIS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:26.864 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC PROCESS AND RECEIVED

00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:28.899 region:rollup2

OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:33.003 region:rollup2
WEST UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED AT OUR

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:34.305 region:rollup2
DECEMBER BOARD HEARING.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:36.774 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT FOR ITS

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:38.509 region:rollup2
APPROVAL WAS OVERWHELMING.

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:40.644 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE STATE'S THIRD

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:42.079 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN AND WE'VE MADE

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.981 region:rollup2
GREAT PROGRESS IN REDUCING

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:45.649 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:48.018 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:49.553 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. BUT AGAIN

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO ADOPTED MORE

STRINGENT AND.

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:55.292 region:rollup2
AMBITIOUS GOALS AND.

00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:56.794 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD OF

US.

00:49:56.794 --> 00:50:00.965 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:02.933 region:rollup2
PLAN CONTINUES THE APPROACH OF

00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:04.335 region:rollup2
USING A MIX OF REGULATIONS

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:06.170 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES AND MARKET BASED

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:07.738 region:rollup2

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:10.274 region:rollup2
AS THE WHICH SUCH AS THE CAP AND

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:11.075 region:rollup2
TRADE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE R. S.

00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:12.643 region:rollup2
B. THIRTY TWO.

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:14.879 region:rollup2
GOALS.

00:50:12.643 --> 00:50:16.814 region:rollup2
USING A COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF

00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:19.183 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE

00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:21.018 region:rollup2
SCOPING CLAN. WE'RE BUILDING ON

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:22.553 region:rollup2
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PAST

00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:23.954 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS.

00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:25.422 region:rollup2
BUT THE SCOPING PLAN ALSO

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:28.092 region:rollup2
PROVIDES.

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:29.894 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY. AS MUCH AS CERTAINTY

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:31.161 region:rollup2
IS AVAILABLE CONSIDERING THE

00:50:29.894 --> 00:50:34.031 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS IN.

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:35.766 region:rollup2

AND OTHER TRANS.

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:40.604 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE ECONOMY.

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:42.573 region:rollup2
IT ALSO DELIVERS A NUMBER OF

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:44.742 region:rollup2
C! BENEFITS AND RESULTS IN A

00:50:42.573 --> 00:50:46.977 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE TEST OF

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:49.146 region:rollup2
BEING COST EFFECTIVE. AND OF

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:51.048 region:rollup2
ATTRACTING UP PARTNERS ACROSS

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:53.317 region:rollup2
THE GLOBE WHICH WAS ONE OF THE

00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:55.219 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES OF AB THIRTY

00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:56.620 region:rollup2
TWO. AND WHICH WE BELIEVE IS

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:58.522 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BOTH BECAUSE.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.357 region:rollup2
GLOBAL WARMING IS BY DEFINITION

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:02.326 region:rollup2
A GLOBAL PROBLEM BUT ALSO

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:04.495 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WILL BENEFIT IN

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:06.764 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:08.999 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMICALLY TO THE EXTENT

00:51:06.764 --> 00:51:11.135 region:rollup2
THAT OUR MEASURES. ARE COPIED BY

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:12.469 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:14.939 region:rollup2
SO IN ADDITION TO REDUCING

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:16.173 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL

00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:17.408 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:18.809 region:rollup2
WERE DEVELOPED AS PART OF OUR

00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:20.844 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO MEET FEDERAL AIR

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:23.614 region:rollup2
QUALITY STANDARDS. AND REDUCE

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:25.249 region:rollup2
TOXICS AS WELL SO THE LOW CARBON

00:51:23.614 --> 00:51:26.750 region:rollup2
FUEL STANDARD AND RENEWABLE

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:28.719 region:rollup2

ENERGY THE ADVANCE CLEAN CARS

00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:34.491 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. WHICH IS PUT MORE THAN

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:36.493 region:rollup2
A QUARTER MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:38.662 region:rollup2
ON THE ROAD AND THE STATE OF

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:40.831 region:rollup2
AFRAID ACTION PLAN WILL RESULT

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:42.633 region:rollup2
IN EFFICIENT AND CLEANER SYSTEMS

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:43.500 region:rollup2
TO MOVE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE

00:51:42.633 --> 00:51:45.235 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.504 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT A CAP AND TRADE

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:49.873 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AS PART OF A PACKAGE

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:52.543 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER REDUCTION MEASURES.

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:54.211 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:56.213 region:rollup2
US TO MEET OUR S. B. THIRTY TWO

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:58.615 region:rollup2
GOALS WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF

00:51:56.213 --> 00:52:00.884 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY AND LOWEST COST

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:02.620 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. IT ALSO PROVIDES

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:04.622 region:rollup2
FURTHER BENEFITS INCLUDING

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:06.323 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE AT

00:52:04.622 --> 00:52:08.325 region:rollup2
DIRECT INVESTMENTS OF CAP AND

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:10.294 region:rollup2
TRADE DOLLARS IN DISADVANTAGED

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:12.630 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSCORES

00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:14.131 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED NATIONAL

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:15.399 region:rollup2
AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON

00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:16.867 region:rollup2
CLIMATE.

00:52:15.399 --> 00:52:18.736 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROVIDES AND

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:20.871 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AND SUSTAIN MARKET

00:52:18.736 --> 00:52:23.073 region:rollup2
SIGNAL TO INVEST IN ENERGY

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:24.675 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY PROMOTING A SHIFT TO

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2
CLEANER FORMS OF ENERGY

00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY.

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.480 region:rollup2
INDEED OUR MODELING SHOWS THAT

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:31.715 region:rollup2
THE COST OF OTHER REGULATORY

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.183 region:rollup2
OPTIONS IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:36.253 region:rollup2
HIGHER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:38.022 region:rollup2
TARGET FOR ANY GIVEN TARGET. SO

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:39.823 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT ARE MULTI PRONGED

00:52:38.022 --> 00:52:42.326 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:44.261 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS IS MORE EFFECTIVE

00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:45.929 region:rollup2
WITH CAP AND TRADE THEM WITHOUT

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.698 region:rollup2
IT. AND WE'RE VERY GRATIFIED

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:49.900 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN

00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:51.268 region:rollup2
US DIRECTION TO MOVE FORWARD

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.869 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROGRAM WITH SOME.

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.937 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ARE PROTECTIONS IN

AT.

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:58.575 region:rollup2
WITH THE DECLINING EMISSIONS CAP

00:52:56.073 --> 00:52:59.877 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS LEADING TO REEL

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:01.311 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE REDUCTIONS OF

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:02.713 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AS

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.848 region:rollup2
OTHER POLLUTANTS. THERE'S

00:53:02.713 --> 00:53:07.051 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN THAT NOT

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:09.153 region:rollup2
ALL FACILITIES ARE REDUCING

00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:11.021 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS EQUALLY UNDER THE CAP.

00:53:09.153 --> 00:53:12.656 region:rollup2
IN ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. IT'S

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:14.525 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:16.560 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS TRUE FOR ALL

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:19.163 region:rollup2
REGULATORY PROGRAMS NOT JUST CAP

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.898 region:rollup2

BECAUSE OF THIS EMISSIONS MAY

00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:00.704 region:rollup2
VARY FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:02.673 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN THEY ARE IN THE SAME

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:05.442 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME

00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:06.944 region:rollup2
REGULATION. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:09.179 region:rollup2
THAN THE WAY CAP AND TRADE WORKS

00:54:06.944 --> 00:54:11.615 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE OVERALL COST EFFECTIVE

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:12.082 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS BY ACCOMMODATING

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES AMONG THE

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:14.918 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:17.020 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.756 region:rollup2
ADDRESS EMISSIONS DISPARITIES

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:21.191 region:rollup2
WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND AMONG

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:22.760 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:25.362 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY SYSTEMS AS A

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.431 region:rollup2
WHOLE THE WHOLE SCOPING PLANT

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:29.533 region:rollup2
AND ITS ASSOCIATED STRATEGIES

00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:31.368 region:rollup2
INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE. AND THE

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:33.170 region:rollup2
LOCAL RULEMAKING AND PERMITTING

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:35.038 region:rollup2
PROCESSES THAT ARE USED TO

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.807 region:rollup2
ADDRESS CRITERIA AND TOXICS

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:39.576 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING

00:54:36.807 --> 00:54:42.546 region:rollup2
THAT FRANKLY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:44.615 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE BEFORE. THAT IS WHY AB

00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:46.283 region:rollup2
ONE NINETY SEVEN AND AB SIX

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:47.618 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN ARE SO IMPORTANT.

00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:49.353 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A NEW

00:54:47.618 --> 00:54:51.488 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT ALONG WITH

00:54:49.353 --> 00:54:53.357 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAWS FOCUSES ON

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:55.292 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS DISPARITIES OF

00:54:53.357 --> 00:54:57.194 region:rollup2
CRITERIA AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:58.796 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES

00:54:57.194 --> 00:55:00.998 region:rollup2
FOR DECADES.

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:03.333 region:rollup2
YOUR HANDOUTS CHAU ARE ALSO SHOW

00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:04.101 region:rollup2
A GRAPH OF THE INVENTORY TREND

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.602 region:rollup2
AND A GRAPH THAT SHOWS HOW

00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:08.038 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S REDUCED GREENHOUSE

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:10.007 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS. RELATIVE TO GROSS

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:11.675 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND PER CAPITA

00:55:10.007 --> 00:55:13.310 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:15.512 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR THIS

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.814 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR STATEWIDE

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:18.582 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HAVE

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:21.118 region:rollup2
DECREASED BY FIFTY MILLION

00:55:18.582 --> 00:55:22.886 region:rollup2
METRIC TONS CO TWO EQUIVALENT OR

00:55:21.118 --> 00:55:24.454 region:rollup2
ABOUT TEN PERCENT.

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:26.456 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:29.092 region:rollup2
REMOVING APPROXIMATELY TEN AND A

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:30.827 region:rollup2
HALF MILLION PASSENGER VEHICLES

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:33.030 region:rollup2
FROM THE ROSE. THAT'S THAT

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.464 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THAT CURRENT EMISSIONS

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.200 region:rollup2
LEVELS THAT THE X. VEHICLES

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:38.702 region:rollup2
EXCUSING.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.469 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:41.939 region:rollup2
HOW THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:44.174 region:rollup2
RECESSION IMPACTED EMISSIONS AS

00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:45.943 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECREASED?

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:48.779 region:rollup2
BUT AS OUR ECONOMY REBOUNDED

00:55:45.943 --> 00:55:50.047 region:rollup2
AFTER THE RECESSION IT IT DID SO

00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:51.682 region:rollup2
WITH A MUCH LOWER CARBON

00:55:50.047 --> 00:55:54.484 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT.

00:55:51.682 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY DECOUPLED

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:59.356 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY FROM

00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:01.058 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN EMISSIONS OF CO TWO.

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:03.026 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:05.095 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE MANY

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:07.698 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ASSUMED THAT REDUCED

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:08.432 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MUST ACCOMPANY

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:10.100 region:rollup2
REDUCE GHG.

00:56:08.432 --> 00:56:11.768 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.703 region:rollup2
OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST FEW

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:14.972 region:rollup2
YEARS HAS SHOWN THAT THAT IS

00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:16.139 region:rollup2
FALSE.

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:17.808 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S DEMONSTRATING TO

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:19.109 region:rollup2
THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DECOUPLE

00:56:17.808 --> 00:56:20.911 region:rollup2
GHG EMISSIONS AND ECONOMIC

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:23.046 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:25.816 region:rollup2
LAST WE'RE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:27.484 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY TWO GHG TARGETS OF

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:29.019 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS OF

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:30.520 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY. WE

00:56:29.019 --> 00:56:31.889 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.857 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET

00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:35.325 region:rollup2
STANDARD SOMEWHAT BEFORE TWENTY

00:56:33.857 --> 00:56:38.128 region:rollup2
TWENTY AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:40.030 region:rollup2
THING. IT PUTS US ON A PATH FOR

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:42.499 region:rollup2
THE NEXT DECADE WHERE WE WILL

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.100 region:rollup2
NEED EVEN STEEPER REDUCTIONS.

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:45.469 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THIS NEW PLAN IS SET

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.738 region:rollup2
TO.

00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:49.239 region:rollup2
ON A PATH TO ACHIEVE A TWENTY

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:51.375 region:rollup2
THIRTY TARGET. THERE ARE MANY

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO FINE TUNE THIS

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:55.779 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.614 region:rollup2
ONE A YEAR AS AYE REPORT TO THIS

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:59.816 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AS REQUIRED ON OUR

00:56:57.614 --> 00:57:01.151 region:rollup2
PROGRESS AND WE ALSO PROVIDE

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:03.353 region:rollup2
WRITTEN REPORTS ON OUR CLIMATE

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:05.088 region:rollup2
CHANGE PROGRAMS. YOU WILL HAVE

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:06.957 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY IN A FORMAL WAY

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:08.525 region:rollup2
TO HEAR WHAT CHANGES WERE

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:09.092 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATING AND TO GIVE US

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:11.762 region:rollup2
YOUR.

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:12.229 region:rollup2
VIEWS IN ADDITION TO OTHER WAYS

00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:14.464 region:rollup2
IN WHICH.

00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:15.499 region:rollup2
YOU OF COURSE HAVE INPUT TO OUR

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:17.668 region:rollup2
WORK AS WELL.

00:57:15.499 --> 00:57:19.436 region:rollup2
R. BOARD RECEIVES ANNUAL

00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:21.738 region:rollup2
BRIEFINGS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:23.707 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN AND A B. THIRTY

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:26.743 region:rollup2
TWO REQUIRES US TO UPDATE THE

00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:28.912 region:rollup2
PLAN EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO ACTIVE

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:31.348 region:rollup2
WORST CASE EVERY FIVE YEARS WE

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:33.350 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PRODUCING A NEW PLAN.

00:57:31.348 --> 00:57:35.552 region:rollup2
THAT UPDATES BASED ON NEW

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.020 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND AN ASSESSMENT

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:38.388 region:rollup2
OF WHERE WE ARE.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.290 region:rollup2
AS WITH ALL OF OUR PLANS AND

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:42.559 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS WILL BE MONITORING

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.860 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTINUING TO

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:46.063 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:48.231 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. AS LOOKING

00:57:46.063 --> 00:57:50.901 region:rollup2
FOR WAYS TO ADJUST COURSE OR

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:53.036 region:rollup2
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AS NEEDED.

00:57:50.901 --> 00:57:54.705 region:rollup2
THERE'S A HANDOUT ALSO THAT

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:56.807 region:rollup2
LISTS ALL OF THE REPORTING AND

00:57:54.705 --> 00:57:58.775 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

00:57:56.807 --> 00:58:01.478 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:02.412 region:rollup2
ENGAGE ON THE CLIMATE PROGRAMS

00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:05.048 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S.

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:07.150 region:rollup2
AYE MAY BE HELPFUL TO JUST SEE

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:09.419 region:rollup2
THAT ARRAY OF. DIFFERENT

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:11.321 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT AB

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:14.891 region:rollup2
THREE NINETY EIGHT PROVIDED

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.326 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC LEGISLATION FOR THE

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:18.829 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:20.997 region:rollup2
PROGRAM INCLUDING THE CAPS

00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:22.833 region:rollup2
ADDING USE OF OFFSETS PRICE

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:25.702 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT POINTS. AND THE

00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:28.739 region:rollup2
PRICE CEILING WE HAVE HEARD THE

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:30.474 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND ALSO FOR MANY

00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:31.975 region:rollup2
OTHERS WHO WANT TO WEIGH IN ON

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
HOW WE SHOULD INCORPORATE THESE

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:35.912 region:rollup2
CHANGES INTO THE REGULATIONS.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:38.682 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:40.350 region:rollup2
ARE NOW IN THE MIDST OF A FULL

00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:42.486 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROCESS THAT WILL

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:45.088 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND CONSIDER ALL THE

00:58:42.486 --> 00:58:46.823 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS. I KNOW THAT THE LA

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:48.525 region:rollup2
I WAS SPEAKING AFTER ME AND WILL

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:50.260 region:rollup2
WANT TO DISCUSS SOME OF THESE

00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:52.062 region:rollup2
AREAS IN MORE DETAIL. I JUST

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.030 region:rollup2
WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:56.166 region:rollup2
NOT REACHED OUR FINAL

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.734 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS ON HOW ANY OF THIS

00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:59.903 region:rollup2
WILL BE PUT FORWARD AND THAT WE

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:01.304 region:rollup2
ARE UP PAYING ATTENTION TO TO

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:03.440 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HEAR.

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:04.775 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE'RE

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.644 region:rollup2
GONNA DO SHARE OUR PROPOSALS

00:59:04.775 --> 00:59:09.613 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:11.581 region:rollup2
ALL MARKET PARTICIPATES AND

00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:14.451 region:rollup2
INTERESTED PARTIES. GET THE SAME

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:16.920 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME AND

00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:19.523 region:rollup2
I MAKE THIS UP POINT BECAUSE WE

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.724 region:rollup2
ARE IMPLEMENTING AS WE SPEAK A

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:22.359 region:rollup2
MARKET BASED PROGRAM WHERE

00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:24.895 region:rollup2
THERE'S TRADING GOING ON. IN

00:59:22.359 --> 00:59:27.631 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CARBON ALLOWANCES AND

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:29.866 region:rollup2
AS WITH ANY TYPE OF A MARKET

00:59:27.631 --> 00:59:32.402 region:rollup2
TRADING PROGRAM AT INSIDER

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:34.671 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HAS VALUE AND CAN

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:36.973 region:rollup2
DISTORT THE PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:38.241 region:rollup2
VERY VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE DO

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:39.776 region:rollup2
RELEASE INFORMATION. THAT WE

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:43.280 region:rollup2
RELEASED IT IN PUBLIC AT THE

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:45.248 region:rollup2
SAME TIME TO EVERYBODY WHO MIGHT

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:48.351 region:rollup2
HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT.

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:50.387 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT OUR

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:52.756 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE. I THINK IT'S

00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:55.192 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH YOU DOES

00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:56.993 region:rollup2
THAT ONE SECTOR REALLY STANDS

00:59:55.192 --> 00:59:58.862 region:rollup2
OUT AS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF

00:59:56.993 --> 01:00:01.364 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND OUR STATE AND THAT

00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:03.066 region:rollup2
IS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IT

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.801 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTY

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:07.370 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL THE GREENHOUSE

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:09.072 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS NINETY PERCENT OF

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.807 region:rollup2
DIESEL PARTICULATE AS I SAID

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:12.676 region:rollup2
BEFORE. LARGEST EMISSIONS

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:14.177 region:rollup2
SOURCES INCLUDING TRUCKS

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.513 region:rollup2
LOCOMOTIVES AND SHIPS

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:18.348 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE IN SOME CASES NOT

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.716 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO DIRECT CONTROL BY THE

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.585 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:23.487 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNDER NATIONAL OR

OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:32.596 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.097 region:rollup2
FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:36.433 region:rollup2
OUR APPROACH IN THIS SECTOR

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.868 region:rollup2
INCLUDES NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:40.403 region:rollup2
FINDING WAYS TO BRING THEM ON

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:42.072 region:rollup2
FUELS INCENTIVES INSISTING OF

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:44.274 region:rollup2
WILL LAND USE PLANNING. BUT A

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:46.142 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR SUCCESS

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.544 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THE

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.279 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:51.348 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:53.483 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS ACTIVELY AT

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:55.452 region:rollup2
WORK DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL

BRINGS ANOTHER ROLLBACK AND

INCREASINGLY ALARMING POLICIES

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:23.246 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY ARE THREATENED THAT

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:24.748 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. TO

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:26.283 region:rollup2
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR

CLIMATE.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:31.087 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED AND I

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:33.356 region:rollup2
BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:35.258 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAY THAT. I EXPECT THAT

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:37.627 region:rollup2
WE WILLCONTINUE TO AT LEAD THE

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:40.163 region:rollup2
WAY NOT ONLY BY PROVIDING AN

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:41.865 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF REDUCING EMISSIONS

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:44.501 region:rollup2
WHILE GROWING OUR ECONOMY. BUT

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:46.736 region:rollup2
ALSO AS A PLACE THAT DRIVES NEW

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:48.338 region:rollup2
pTECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:50.240 region:rollup2
STATE THAT LOOKS BEYOND OUR

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:52.008 region:rollup2
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.844 region:rollup2
DECADES INTO THE FUTURE.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:57.480 region:rollup2
HOWEVER FEDERAL ACTIONS OR LACK

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:59.082 region:rollup2
THEREOF MAY NOT ONLY IN PERIL

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.284 region:rollup2
LOT ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN IN

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:03.653 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES BUT ALSO MAY

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:06.156 region:rollup2
UNDERCUT OUR ABILITY AS A STATE.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:07.257 region:rollup2
WE ARE UNIQUE IN THE COUNTRY AND

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO ADOPT MORE

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:10.927 region:rollup2
STRINGENT MOTOR VEHICLE

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:12.362 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AS A STATE. BASED ON

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:14.264 region:rollup2
THE HISTORY OF OUR EARLY

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:16.666 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND OUR

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:19.236 region:rollup2
ON GOING AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:21.137 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN ORDER TO ADOPT NEW

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:22.305 region:rollup2
STANDARDS EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:24.574 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM.

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:26.610 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO SEEK A WAIVER FROM

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.411 region:rollup2
U. S. EPA. THIS PROCESS HAS

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.313 region:rollup2
GROWN TO INCLUDE OUR GREENHOUSE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.282 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS ALSO

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS THE PAVLEY REGULATIONS.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.085 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE WE'VE USED THIS

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:37.587 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:39.756 region:rollup2
ATTRACT OTHER STATES THAT WANT

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:41.024 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD WHICH THEY

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.559 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO.

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:44.160 region:rollup2
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEEK A

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:45.895 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.664 region:rollup2
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:48.765 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO THE VEHICLE EMISSION

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:50.900 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THE TRUMP

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:52.936 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION MAY CHOOSE NOT TO

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.805 region:rollup2
APPROVE R. WAIVERS. TO PURSUE

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:57.641 region:rollup2
FUTURE STANDARDS OR EVEN ATTEMPT

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:59.376 region:rollup2
TO ATTACK OUR AUTHORITY

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:02.946 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:04.614 region:rollup2
AND I I WANT TO END ON THIS NOTE

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:06.549 region:rollup2
OF ALARM BECAUSE.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.351 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE ABILITY

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:10.754 region:rollup2
TO SET GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.287 region:rollup2
FOR VEHICLES. WE WOULD CERTAINLY

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.756 region:rollup2
FIGHT.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.724 region:rollup2
WE WOULD FIGHT IT WITH EVERY

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:16.893 region:rollup2
LEGAL TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:18.395 region:rollup2
US AS WELL AS. ALL OTHER TOOLS

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:19.829 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COURT

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:23.767 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC OPINION.

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:25.468 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE WERE TO LOSE WE WOULD

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2
REALLY LOSE SIGNIFICANT

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:29.939 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:31.441 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE. ALL OF THE VARIOUS.

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:33.610 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:35.378 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. OUR

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.380 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO REDUCE MOBILE SOURCE

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:40.350 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS INCLUDING GREENHOUSE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:42.285 region:rollup2
GASES AND CRITERIA AND TOXICS

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.887 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HUGELY IMPAIRED NOT TO

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:45.355 region:rollup2
MENTION THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:47.891 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE HEALTH.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:50.694 region:rollup2
OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IF WE

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:55.265 region:rollup2
WERE TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:56.433 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE OUR OVERALL GOALS WE

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP THE

01:03:56.433 --> 01:04:00.970 region:rollup2
REMAINING REDUCTIONS THROUGH

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:04.774 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE MEASURES THAT WOULD

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:07.377 region:rollup2
BE DIRECTED AT OTHER SECTORS AS

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:10.580 region:rollup2
AS NECESSARY SO. WITH THAT.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:12.882 region:rollup2
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY I'M

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.584 region:rollup2
SORRY THAT THIS HAS BEEN A LONG

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:16.720 region:rollup2
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:19.622 region:rollup2
TO LAY OUT THE.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.991 region:rollup2
OVERALL AND SITUATION IN

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:25.395 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:27.430 region:rollup2
WE WERE AND ASKED IN ADVANCE AND

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:31.735 region:rollup2
I AM GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY TO

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:33.336 region:rollup2
TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THAT THANK

YOU A COLLEAGUES UNLESS THERE'S

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:40.977 region:rollup2
A BURNING QUESTION THAT WE WANT

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:44.180 region:rollup2
TO ASK NOW IS IT OKAY IF. WE GO

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:46.449 region:rollup2
INTO THE NEXT PRESENTER. AND

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.418 region:rollup2
THEN OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:52.489 region:rollup2
AND AND. COMMENTS.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:53.056 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS IS OKAY YEP THEN WILL.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.390 region:rollup2

ISRAEL YEAH.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:05:00.630 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT CLEARLY BECAUSE CAP AND

01:04:54.023 --> 01:05:01.464 region:rollup2
TRADE

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.732 region:rollup2
AS OF REFERENCE GONNA PLAYS A

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.566 region:rollup2
KEY ROLE AND.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.101 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.436 region:rollup2
THIRTY SCOPING PLAN THAT WAS

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.804 region:rollup2
RECENTLY ADOPTED BY CAR.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.439 region:rollup2
AS SORT OF THE WAY TO ENSURE

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:11.641 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE MEETS ITS

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:13.610 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND SO WE

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.145 region:rollup2
WANT TO KIND OF FOCUS ON SOME

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.813 region:rollup2
THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.781 region:rollup2
THAT COULD THAT COULD AFFECT.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:20.049 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY OF THE PROGRAM

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
TO HELP ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:23.052 region:rollup2
I WILL JUST MAKE JUST THAT

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.254 region:rollup2
BEFORE I CAN GET INTO SOME OF

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.456 region:rollup2
THOSE KEY IMPLEMENTATION

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:27.924 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:29.225 region:rollup2
AND OVERSIGHT ISSUES THAT WE

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:31.728 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:33.763 region:rollup2
DO JUST WANT TO KIND OF. MAKE A

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:34.364 region:rollup2
BRIEF COMMENT ON JUST GENERAL

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.999 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:38.134 region:rollup2
AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:40.270 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.870 region:rollup2
.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.504 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN INCLUDES A

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.906 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT THE

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:44.574 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DIRECTED

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:45.675 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AS AN

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.210 region:rollup2
RP ASSN VARIOUS ENERGY

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.211 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:50.180 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO A FAIR

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:51.748 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF DISCRETION FOR CARP TO

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.649 region:rollup2
ADOPTS ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:53.283 region:rollup2
IT FEELS IT AND ARE NEEDED TO

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.084 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.885 region:rollup2
GAS GOALS AND POLICIES. WHILE

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.420 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.555 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IN STATUTE.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.889 region:rollup2
FOR A RB TO CONSIDER THINGS

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.857 region:rollup2
LIKE COST EFFECTIVENESS.

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:02.992 region:rollup2
.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:05.528 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:07.497 region:rollup2
PIMCO POLLUTANTS LEAKAGE IN A

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.999 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THERE'D THAT COMES

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:12.235 region:rollup2
DOWN TO KIND OF.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.869 region:rollup2
DELICATE BALANCE A BALANCE IN

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:14.704 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FACTORS AND

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:16.206 region:rollup2
SO I SINCE THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:17.640 region:rollup2
OF DISCRETION GIVEN TO CAR WE

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:19.476 region:rollup2
THINK THESE TYPES OF OVERSIGHT

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.844 region:rollup2
HEARINGS TO. CHECK IN ON KIND OF

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.212 region:rollup2
HOW CARP HAS BALLOTS THOSE

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:24.214 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUTTING THE

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:24.447 region:rollup2
PLAN TOGETHER ARE PARTICULARLY.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:26.483 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.985 region:rollup2
AND ARE BE ONE KEY ISSUE TO.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.453 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR TO KEEP AN EYE ON

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.554 region:rollup2
IS IS COST EFFECTIVENESS

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.622 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS IN THE COSTS

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.857 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENT

POLICIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:36.626 region:rollup2
THE PLAN.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.527 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS ARE ARE ULTIMATELY

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:38.995 region:rollup2
BORNE BY.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
AND SO WE THINK SOME IMPORTANT

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:44.200 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.435 region:rollup2
MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE TO ASK IN

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.703 region:rollup2
THIS HEARING AND OTHERS IS.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.071 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT OF POLICIES

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:50.039 region:rollup2
ADOPTED THAT IT'S ESTIMATED TO

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:51.040 region:rollup2
BE MORE COSTLY THEN ALTERNATIVE

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:53.343 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.311 region:rollup2
ADOPTING THAT POLICY WIRES.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:57.046 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY MORE COSTLY POLICY

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:59.048 region:rollup2
BEING ADOPTED ARE THERE MAY BE

01:06:57.046 --> 01:07:00.717 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD REASONS FOR DOING THAT

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:02.352 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THERE'S NEEDS TO BE SOME

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PUSH OR

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.521 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.955 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.257 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED FOR THAT POLICY BUT.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:08.391 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO GET GOOD INFORMATION

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:09.459 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:11.327 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COSTS MIGHT BE WORTH.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:12.829 region:rollup2
WHATEVER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:13.596 region:rollup2
MIGHT COME WITHOUT POLICY.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:15.265 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:16.900 region:rollup2
PERHAPS ASKING THE QUESTION ARE

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:18.167 region:rollup2
THERE OTHER POLICY TOOLS ARE

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.769 region:rollup2
AVENUES THAT COULD BE USED TO

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:21.237 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE OTHER.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.805 region:rollup2
GOALS THAT ARE TRYING TO THAT

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:25.408 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T TRYING TO BE ACHIEVED

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:27.710 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:30.113 region:rollup2
I THINK AB SIX SEVENTEEN IT'S

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:32.081 region:rollup2
GOT ANOTHER IS AN EXAMPLE OF.

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:33.950 region:rollup2
KIND OF AN APPROACH TO TRYING

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:36.286 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:38.922 region:rollup2
THROUGH SORT OF DIFFERENT A

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:39.889 region:rollup2
POLICY VENUE THAN THAN THE SCOPE

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:41.624 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.592 region:rollup2
THE OTHER KEY ISSUE.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:43.826 region:rollup2
WE WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS JUST KIND

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.827 region:rollup2
OF THE. THE QUESTIONS AROUND.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.529 region:rollup2
THE RISK AND THE LIKELIHOOD

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:47.597 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLAN AS OUTLINED.

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.331 region:rollup2
BY CAR BUT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.599 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE STATE'S TWENTY

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:50.466 region:rollup2
THIRTY GOALS AND AS I MENTIONED

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.234 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.268 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE IS REALLY SORT

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.403 region:rollup2
CENTRAL IN THE PLAN AS A

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:55.805 region:rollup2
BACKSTOP.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:57.140 region:rollup2
TWO IF YOU KNOW OTHER POLICIES

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.074 region:rollup2
EITHER DON'T WORK OR JUST MAKE

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.442 region:rollup2
UP THE DIFFERENCE AND THE

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.009 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NEEDED THAT OTHER

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.179 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:05.148 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THE CABIN TRADERS

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:06.316 region:rollup2
THERE. TO KIND OF HELP ACHIEVE

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:07.317 region:rollup2
THOSE GOALS AND HELP ME THE

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.785 region:rollup2
STATE TARGETS.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.852 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE KEY QUESTION

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:12.455 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:13.923 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ASK IS IS A PROGRAM

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.757 region:rollup2
UP TO THAT SHOT IS A DESIGNED IN

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.292 region:rollup2
A WAY.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:18.127 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THOSE

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:19.329 region:rollup2
GOALS AND THIS GETS INTO SOME OF

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:20.930 region:rollup2
THE DETAILS AROUND KIND OF THE

01:08:19.329 --> 01:08:22.298 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DESIGN ELEMENTS AND

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:26.836 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. THAT WE.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:28.204 region:rollup2
DISCUSS IN OUR REPORT SO. I

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.806 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON TWO OF

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:31.074 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES THERE'S WE TALK

01:08:29.806 --> 01:08:32.909 region:rollup2
ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES IN OUR

01:08:31.074 --> 01:08:34.177 region:rollup2
REPORT BUT I WANNA TOUCH ON. TWO

01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:35.111 region:rollup2
OF THEM IS AS IMPORTANT KIND OF

01:08:34.177 --> 01:08:36.546 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND THINGS THAT THINK

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.914 region:rollup2
ABOUT AS FAR AS RISKS OF NOT

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:40.149 region:rollup2
MEETING THE. THE.

01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:42.218 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.752 region:rollup2
AND ANYTHING ABOUT DESIGN

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.519 region:rollup2
FEATURES THE CAP AND TRADE

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:46.990 region:rollup2
THE FIRST RELATES TO.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.925 region:rollup2
BANKING AND SETTING THE POST

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:50.293 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY CAPS

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:51.761 region:rollup2
SO THIS REAL QUICKLY BANKING AS

01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:53.463 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DESIGN FEATURE IN THE

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:55.331 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHERE AN

01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:56.132 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCE ISSUED TODAY. CAN BE

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.567 region:rollup2
USED TO.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
HELD OUT A PURCHASED IN HELD

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.103 region:rollup2
ONTO AND USED IN A FUTURE YOU'RE

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.105 region:rollup2
IN THE PROGRAM.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:03.106 region:rollup2
AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF.

01:09:02.105 --> 01:09:05.308 region:rollup2
.

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:05.475 region:rollup2
SET UP AS SORT OF A WAY TO KIND

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.877 region:rollup2
OF.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.544 region:rollup2
AND MITIGATE PRICE VOLATILITY

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.279 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WRITTEN OFF THERE'S AN

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:12.148 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION AS THE KAPPA COMES

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.449 region:rollup2
MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME PRICES

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.884 region:rollup2
IN LATER YEARS COULD BE QUITE A

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:16.419 region:rollup2
BIT HIGHER FOR ALLOWANCES THAN

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:18.087 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TODAY AND SO THAT.

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:19.422 region:rollup2
CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO.

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:21.324 region:rollup2
PURCHASED OR OBTAINED SOME

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:22.592 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES NOW AND SO THAT HAS

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:24.360 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF KIND OF.

01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:24.861 region:rollup2
SMOOTHING PRICES OVER TIME

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.596 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY CAN I THINK

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:27.130 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY INCREASING PRICES IN

01:09:26.596 --> 01:09:28.631 region:rollup2
THE NEAR TERM BUT LOWERING

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.199 region:rollup2
PRICES.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.801 region:rollup2
IN THE OUT YEARS AND SO IT AND

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:33.736 region:rollup2
ALSO HAS OR HAS THE EFFECT OF

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.637 region:rollup2
MOVING. EMISSIONS AN EMISSION

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:36.973 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS.

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:38.174 region:rollup2
FROM ONE TIME PERIOD TO THE

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:39.842 region:rollup2
OTHER TIME PERIOD.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:41.110 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:42.478 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH AND I HAVE BEEN

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2
BANKING AS PART OF THE PROGRAM

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:46.582 region:rollup2
REDUCING PRICE VOLATILITY

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:47.750 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING. EARLIER A MISSION

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:50.119 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN THOSE ARE.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.920 region:rollup2
WE THINK SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:52.655 region:rollup2
TO HAVING THAT AS PART OF THE

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.923 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. OUT WE JUST WENT OUT

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:55.691 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT ONE TRADE OFF

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:56.159 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING THAT BY BY

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
HAVING.

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:59.695 region:rollup2
BANKING ALLOWED IN THE PROGRAM

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:01.564 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY CREATES A KIND OF

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.965 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE CAP OVER MANY

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:05.868 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT YEARS OF THE PROGRAM

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:07.437 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT. AN ANNUAL CAP ON

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.337 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:09.105 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY KIND OF SINCE YOU

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.907 region:rollup2
CAN MOVE THOSE ALLOW ALLOWANCES

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:11.841 region:rollup2
FROM EARLY YEARS TO LATER YEARS

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.109 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAME OUT OF CAP ON

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:14.777 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND. THAT JUST CREATES

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:16.612 region:rollup2
A KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL TENSION

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.914 region:rollup2
BETWEEN. OF HAVING THAT ASPECT

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:20.216 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM AND HAVING A

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:21.451 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET IN

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.752 region:rollup2
PLACE AND SO WE JUST KIND OF

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:24.487 region:rollup2
WANNA. HIGHLIGHT THAT AS ONE

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.221 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO TO THINK

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:26.956 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:28.791 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY ANY CERTAINTY THAT

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.325 region:rollup2
HAPPENED TRADE. PROVIDES IS

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2
GOING TO PROVIDE SECULAR

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:33.096 region:rollup2
ADMONITION CERTAINTY BUT NOT

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:34.297 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY AS MUCH. ANNUAL

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:35.331 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS CERTAINTY.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.999 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN USE SOME BANK

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.201 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES FROM EARLIER YEARS

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.336 region:rollup2
AND LATER YEARS.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.971 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS THAT COULD BE

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:43.439 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT F.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.974 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:46.676 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES THAT CAN BE BANKS

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:48.377 region:rollup2
FROM EARLIER YEARS AND USED IN

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:49.245 region:rollup2
LATER YEARS. AND YOU YOU COULD

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.913 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.448 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE IN THE LATER

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.983 region:rollup2
YEARS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BANK

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:55.084 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES ARE USED YOU'RE SICK

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:57.053 region:rollup2
YOU ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.988 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT YOUR ACTUAL TWENTY

01:10:57.053 --> 01:11:02.725 region:rollup2
THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET DOES.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:05.027 region:rollup2
I I'D LIKE TO POINT YOU TO A

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:06.863 region:rollup2
PAGE AIDS OF OUR REPORT IN

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:08.064 region:rollup2
FIGURE THREE.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.899 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY OUR

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:11.601 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:13.136 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATION OF JUST SOME OF THE

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:15.738 region:rollup2
ISSUES I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.873 region:rollup2
.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:19.142 region:rollup2
JUST TOOK A WALK YOU THROUGH

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:21.544 region:rollup2
FIGURE THREE ON PAGE EIGHT.

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:24.614 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE THE TOP AND A LIGHT

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:26.349 region:rollup2
PURPLE LINE THERE IS REALLY.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.283 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ANNUAL CAPS ARE THE NOT

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:29.352 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THE NUMBER OF

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:30.019 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED IN

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM AND YOU'LL SEE THAT

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:34.056 region:rollup2
KIND OF? RELATIVELY STEEP

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.424 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN THE ANNUAL CAPS FROM.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:37.760 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN DOWN TO TWENTY

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:39.128 region:rollup2
THIRTY REACHING THAT THE TWENTY

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.497 region:rollup2
THIRTY ANNUAL TARGET.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.899 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THE REDLINE THAT'S A

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:44.100 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT BELOW THAT IN THIS

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:45.802 region:rollup2
LITTLE LESS DEEP THAN THAT

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
PURPLE LINE. IS KIND OF THOSE

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.838 region:rollup2
FIRST COUPLE YEARS IN TWENTY

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN IS WHERE

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:52.408 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS OF ACTUALLY. BAN SO

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:54.076 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE AN AND TWENTY

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.978 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN EMISSIONS

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:57.380 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN BELOW WHERE THOSE

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.447 region:rollup2
ANNUAL CAPS HAVE BEEN.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.715 region:rollup2
AND THIS EXAMPLE IN THIS CHART

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:01.117 region:rollup2
WE JUST PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:03.586 region:rollup2
SCENARIO WHERE EMISSIONS

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:05.521 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DECLINE BUT I.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:07.323 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AT A RELATIVELY STEADY

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.824 region:rollup2
RATE AND NOT AS STEEP AS THAT

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:10.693 region:rollup2
THE COPS ACTUAL ACTUALLY DECLINE

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.960 region:rollup2
AND SO IN THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.228 region:rollup2
YOU COULD.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.863 region:rollup2
RESULTS

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:15.464 region:rollup2
AND A LARGE NUMBER OF BANKS

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.966 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES FROM SO THAT'S THE

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.533 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THE

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.701 region:rollup2
PURPLE LINE AND THAT THE RED

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:21.070 region:rollup2
LINE.

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:22.505 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE KIND OF HELD ONTO NOT

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.607 region:rollup2
USED IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS OF

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:26.509 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM AND THEN USE TO

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:28.444 region:rollup2
COMPLY AND THE LATER YEARS OF

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.679 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. AND SO IF YOU YOU

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:30.780 region:rollup2
SORT OF SEE THE RIGHT HAND SIDE

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:32.148 region:rollup2
OF THE CHART THERE AS HE REACHED

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.482 region:rollup2
THE LATER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM

01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:35.251 region:rollup2
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY.

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:36.485 region:rollup2
YOU GET OUT A SCENARIO WHERE

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:39.021 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS ALTHOUGH

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:40.122 region:rollup2
THE CAPS ARE SET LOWER AND I CAN

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.624 region:rollup2
SET TO REACH THE TWENTY THIRTY

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:43.392 region:rollup2
TARGET. ACTUAL EMISSIONS ARE

01:12:41.624 --> 01:12:44.660 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.063 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THIS IS THIS IS ONE

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.497 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE MANY

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.899 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:51.601 region:rollup2
FUTURE SCENARIOS BUT THE TYPE

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:53.035 region:rollup2
OF EXAMPLE WE THINK THAT THE

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:54.537 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND CARVE SHOULD BE.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.504 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT AND THINKING

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:57.073 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.608 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY DOES NOT A CAP AND

01:12:57.073 --> 01:13:00.843 region:rollup2
TRADE PROGRAM AS CURRENTLY

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:02.011 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED PROVIDED MEDIAN THE

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:03.446 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.947 region:rollup2
I EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT DOES

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:06.148 region:rollup2
PROVIDE DIRECTION TO CARB TO.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:07.984 region:rollup2
TO ANALYZE THIS ISSUE AND SO WE

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:09.051 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:10.052 region:rollup2
TO GO IMPORTANT FILED FOR THE

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.387 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN TO TO CONTINUE

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.890 region:rollup2
TO ASK.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.957 region:rollup2
HOW CARBS ANALYZING THIS ISSUE

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.759 region:rollup2
WHAT CRITERIA THAT'S GOING TO

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.894 region:rollup2
USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OUT OF

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:19.128 region:rollup2
THINKS IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.563 region:rollup2
AND IF SO IF IT IS DETERMINED TO

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.998 region:rollup2
BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE? WHAT

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.699 region:rollup2
TYPES OF RESPONSES THE STATE

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:24.767 region:rollup2
MIGHT TAKE TO ADDRESS THIS

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:27.370 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL RISK IN NOT MEETING

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:29.405 region:rollup2
THE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ARM?

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:30.740 region:rollup2
AND OUR OUR REPORT WE HIGHLIGHT

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.108 region:rollup2
ONE POTENTIAL OPTION.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.709 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS DETERMINED TO BE A

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:35.211 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF NOT MEETING

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
OUR OUR OF THE LONG TERM TWENTY

THIRTY GOALS.

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:41.884 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW ADJUSTING

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:43.019 region:rollup2
POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS TO ANNE

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
OF DOWNWARD ESSENTIALLY.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.655 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.590 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES SOLD AT REGULAR

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:49.292 region:rollup2
OPTIONS GOING FORWARD A TO KINDA

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.659 region:rollup2
HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THERE'S

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:52.128 region:rollup2
A.

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:53.496 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THERE'S A

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:54.864 region:rollup2
A RISK ERA TRADE OFF I GUESS

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:55.898 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE WITH DOING THAT BY

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:57.099 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:59.168 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES THAT PUTS UPWARD

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:01.337 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ON. PRICES AND COULD

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:03.406 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE COSTS

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:04.807 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM. AND

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.509 region:rollup2
THAT SAID YOU WERE OUT THERE ARE

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:07.743 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF OTHER AYE DESIGN

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.844 region:rollup2
FEATURES IN THE CABIN FOR A

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:10.646 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LIKE A HARD PRICE

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:12.014 region:rollup2
CEILING LIKE VARIOUS PRICE

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:14.083 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT POINTS THAT ARE.

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:16.185 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SET OUT TO TRY AND

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:18.220 region:rollup2
MITIGATE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:19.956 region:rollup2
HIGH PRICES IN AND PRICE

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.656 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND SO I WOULD THINK

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:21.857 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE IN THE

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:23.459 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION OUT OF THINK ABOUT

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:25.761 region:rollup2
RELYING ON THOSE ARE SORT OF THE

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:27.730 region:rollup2
THE TOOL TO MITIGATE AGAINST

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.998 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL. PRICE INCREASES.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.932 region:rollup2
NOW THE SECOND FEATURE I'LL JUST

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.967 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON VERY BRIEFLY.

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:33.970 region:rollup2
AND AS WAS REFERENCED IN THE

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
OPENING COMMENTS R. EIGHTY THREE

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.639 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT ALSO DIRECTED CARB

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:37.840 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH A HARD PRICE

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.574 region:rollup2
CEILING.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.310 region:rollup2
AND.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:44.080 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY AN EFFORT TO HELP.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:45.281 region:rollup2
LIMIT POTENTIAL HIGH COSTS AND

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.349 region:rollup2
HIGHER ALLOWANCE PRICES IN THE

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.417 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:50.019 region:rollup2
THIS IS IMPLEMENTED.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:51.954 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BY.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:53.656 region:rollup2
ONCE PRICES REACHED THAT THE

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:55.424 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF THAT HARD PRICE CEILING

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:57.927 region:rollup2
THEN CARVE WILL.

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:59.061 region:rollup2
ISSUE OR SAU ALLOWANCES AT THAT

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.596 region:rollup2
PRICE ESSENTIALLY AN UNLIMITED

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.931 region:rollup2
NUMBER ALLOWANCES AT THAT PRICE

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:03.165 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THIS DESIGN FEATURE

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:04.834 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:06.369 region:rollup2
CONTAINING COSTS THERE. CLEAR

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.603 region:rollup2
TRADE OFF IS THAT IF PRICES

01:15:06.369 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
REACHED THAT LEVEL THEN THERE'S

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:11.340 region:rollup2
NO LONGER THE SAME TYPE OF CAP

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:13.275 region:rollup2
ON EMISSIONS AND. AND CAR WILL.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.710 region:rollup2
WILL ISSUE COMPLIANCE

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.978 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENTS UNLIMITED EMERALD

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:17.580 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS AT THAT

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:20.883 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PRICE.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:22.151 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATION GIVES CAR

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:24.387 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE AYE AYE ANOTHER

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:26.021 region:rollup2
AREA OF KIND OF RISK UNCERTAINTY

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:27.390 region:rollup2
AROUND SEE OF THE STATE. THE

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.591 region:rollup2
CAPTAIN OF ENSURING THAT THE

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:29.658 region:rollup2
STATE NEEDS ITS CLIMATE GOALS

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:30.559 region:rollup2
AND ARGUED THAT IT'S A

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:33.896 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:34.330 region:rollup2
POLICY. A DESIGN FEATURE BUT IT

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:36.532 region:rollup2
IT IS IT IS A RISK.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.933 region:rollup2
.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.034 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION AB THREE NINETY

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.569 region:rollup2
EIGHT GETS CAR BUT.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.737 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:43.773 region:rollup2
DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THIS

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.508 region:rollup2
PRICE CEILING SO HAVE HOW TO

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:47.943 region:rollup2
BALANCE THAT COST CONTAINMENT

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:49.078 region:rollup2
FEATURE AND. THE POTENTIAL OF OF

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.846 region:rollup2
ISSUING MORE ALLOWANCES AND

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:52.715 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING WHAT THE

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:53.516 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL CAPPERS. SO THAT'S

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.017 region:rollup2
AGAIN A VERY.

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:56.652 region:rollup2
AND ARGUE IMPORTANT AREA FOR

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:58.187 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:59.822 region:rollup2
HAVE OVERSIGHT ON.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:00.656 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR CAR BAND ITS PROPOSED

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:02.792 region:rollup2
PRICE CEILING?

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:04.360 region:rollup2
BALANCES THESE CONCERNS AROUND

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:05.494 region:rollup2
COSTS AS WELL AS EMISSIONS

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY IN A WAY THAT THE

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.930 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.299 region:rollup2
AGREES WITH THINGS CONSISTENT

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:12.168 region:rollup2
WITH ITS PRIORITIES.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:13.135 region:rollup2
FINALLY I I JUST TOUCH VERY

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.403 region:rollup2
QUICKLY ON JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:15.104 region:rollup2
WE RAISED IN THE REPORT AND THAT

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.872 region:rollup2
RELATES TO JUST ONGOING

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:18.507 region:rollup2

AND ARMY WE THINK THAT'S AN

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.906 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IN TO PROVIDE A

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:52.708 region:rollup2
LOT OF VALUE IN HELPING THE

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:54.176 region:rollup2

A PRICE I SORT OF WANTED TO

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:34.129 region:rollup2

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:35.364 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:37.700 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT HOW YOU

01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:40.369 region:rollup2

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.137 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN THE LAST PIECE.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:43.372 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT.

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:52.848 region:rollup2
IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT IS NOT

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:55.918 region:rollup2

ULTIMATELY WE CAN GET THERE ON

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:01.023 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE BUT I DON'T THINK

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:02.658 region:rollup2
IT'S THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE STATE

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.892 region:rollup2
TO RELY SOLELY ON THAT I KNOW WE

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:05.461 region:rollup2

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:22.538 region:rollup2
LIKE CUT SOME OF THAT OUT OF OUR

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:23.939 region:rollup2
DIET AND START TO TIGHTEN OUR

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:27.376 region:rollup2
BELTS A BIT. MORE DISK INTO

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:27.576 region:rollup2
BACKSLIDE WE ARE PROBLEMS SO

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:28.410 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:30.112 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE BUT

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:34.016 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS. WELL

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:35.417 region:rollup2
NOT EXPENSIVE AT ALL YEAH.

01:22:34.016 --> 01:22:36.852 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AYE I'LL TRY TO

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:38.821 region:rollup2
ANSWER ALL THREE QUESTIONS AND

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:40.155 region:rollup2
I'LL DO IT THEM FAIRLY BRIEFLY

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:42.424 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS THAT. I

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:44.459 region:rollup2
THINK DIRECTED TO THE ISSUE OF

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:45.594 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN THE INVENTORY AND IN

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.795 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:48.230 region:rollup2
THE.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:50.165 region:rollup2
.

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.166 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WHICH WE'VE CERTAINLY

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:54.036 region:rollup2
FACED VERY DRAMATICALLY THIS

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:56.305 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT AB FIRES CAN RELEASE

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:57.573 region:rollup2
LARGE QUANTITIES OF CO TWO AND

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.607 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S GOING ON YOU'RE NOT

01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:00.008 region:rollup2
REALLY SITTING AROUND WORRYING

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:01.844 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOUR INVENTORY YOUR

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:03.879 region:rollup2
WORRYING ABOUT THE FIRE AND THE

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:05.514 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON PEOPLE. ARE WHAT ARE

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:08.083 region:rollup2
WE DOING ABOUT THAT SO.

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:09.885 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO AND NATURAL

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:12.221 region:rollup2
RESOURCES POLICY THE TWENTY

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:13.522 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN HAS A LOT

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:15.457 region:rollup2
MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT THAN WE

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:16.124 region:rollup2
HAVE IN PREVIOUS SCOPING PLANTS

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:18.293 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:21.330 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY CLEAR THAT.

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:22.064 region:rollup2
THAT OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS NEED

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.499 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:26.368 region:rollup2
IN BETTER SHAPE BOTH TO

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:29.238 region:rollup2
CONSERVE THE CARBON THAT'S

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:31.707 region:rollup2
STORED THEY ARE NOW IN OUR LAND

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:34.943 region:rollup2
AND AND PLANTS AND AT THE SAME

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:35.944 region:rollup2
TIME. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO OUR

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:38.247 region:rollup2
PREVENT.

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:41.383 region:rollup2
RELEASES THAT.

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:42.918 region:rollup2
IT CAN REALLY I HAVE A. VERY

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:45.521 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC EFFECT ON ON GLOBAL

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:47.589 region:rollup2
WARMING OVERALL AS DROUGHT

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:51.260 region:rollup2
CONTINUES AS WE HAVE.

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:52.661 region:rollup2
MORE STRESSES ON OUR ECOSYSTEMS.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.364 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT MOVING IN THE RIGHT

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:58.500 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:23:55.364 --> 01:24:00.502 region:rollup2
STRONG ACTION. TO PROTECT OUR

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:03.405 region:rollup2
NATURAL RESOURCES IN WAYS THAT

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:04.640 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM THE

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:07.276 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.212 region:rollup2
PERFORM IN TERMS OF ABSORBING A

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:12.347 region:rollup2
CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. OF

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:14.716 region:rollup2
THE ARAB STATES AT THROUGH THE

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:17.786 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AGENCY HAS DONE A LOT

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:19.621 region:rollup2
OF WORK ON OCEANS AND SOME AS

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:21.924 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NOW IN THE WORKS AT A

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:23.458 region:rollup2
FOREST CARBON PLAN. BUT I THINK

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:24.493 region:rollup2
WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:26.795 region:rollup2
MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:29.264 region:rollup2
HERE THIS IS ALSO A WORLDWIDE

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:30.832 region:rollup2
PROBLEM I KNOW. MENTIONING THE

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:32.467 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF YOU KNOW

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:34.870 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PLAYING ANY KIND OF A

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:35.537 region:rollup2
ROLE IN PROTECTING FORESTS

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:37.372 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE.

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:39.341 region:rollup2
CAUSES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:40.475 region:rollup2
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THERE'S

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:41.710 region:rollup2
NO QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:43.679 region:rollup2
FIRST LOOKING AT OUR OWN.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:45.480 region:rollup2
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:47.883 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.919 region:rollup2
GLOBAL INVENTORIES WE'VE KNOWN

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:51.820 region:rollup2
FOR DECADES NOW THAT YOU CAN

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:55.724 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:57.893 region:rollup2
THE THE LEVELS OF LIMITATION ON

01:24:55.724 --> 01:25:00.929 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AT THE LEVELS OF HAVE

01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:04.766 region:rollup2
CONTROL OVER WARMING THAT WE'RE

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:06.702 region:rollup2
AIMING FOR WITHOUT INCLUDING AT

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:10.639 region:rollup2
NATURAL RESOURCES IN THAT THAT

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:12.741 region:rollup2
IS IF WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW OUR.

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:15.811 region:rollup2
TROPICAL FORESTS OR OUR

01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:19.848 region:rollup2
TEMPERATE FORESTS TO BE DEGRADED

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:23.318 region:rollup2
OR TO DISAPPEAR WE WON'T MAKE IT

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:25.587 region:rollup2
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WESTCAR SO

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:28.256 region:rollup2
WHERE POWER PLANTS OR WHATEVER

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:31.059 region:rollup2
SO. THAT'S KIND OF THE THAT THE

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:34.930 region:rollup2
BASIC ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:36.732 region:rollup2
YOUR SECOND QUESTION I THINK

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:41.770 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT.

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:44.373 region:rollup2
FEDERAL OVERSUPPLY SO THE

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:49.745 region:rollup2
OVERSUPPLY SORRY OVER SPY.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:50.746 region:rollup2
SO ON SHRINKING THE NUMBER OF

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:54.783 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES AS.

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:57.152 region:rollup2
AS WAS INDICATED BY MY

01:25:54.783 --> 01:26:00.322 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE HERE THERE'S ALWAYS A

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:03.959 region:rollup2
TENSION BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:04.526 region:rollup2
KEEP PRICES MODERATE AND

01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:12.000 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE AND TO MAKE THE

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:14.836 region:rollup2
PROGRAM

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.372 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTABLE UNDERSTANDABLE.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:19.808 region:rollup2
AND EFFECTIVE AND FREE OF

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:20.142 region:rollup2
SCANDALS IN HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:23.378 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE.

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:25.514 region:rollup2
THE POSSIBILITY OF A COMPANY

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:26.548 region:rollup2
COMING IN AND BUYING UP A LOT OF

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.316 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES SPEAKS THEIR CHEAP

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:30.752 region:rollup2
NOW AND THEN IN HOARDING THEM

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:32.788 region:rollup2
UNTIL SOME LATER TIME. WE PUT

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:34.556 region:rollup2
HOLDING LIMITS IN THE FACT ALL

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:36.825 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:39.294 region:rollup2
IN THAT REGARD HAS MADE PEOPLE

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:40.462 region:rollup2
WHO ARE MARKET AT.

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:42.297 region:rollup2
EXPERTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:43.665 region:rollup2
TRADE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:46.768 region:rollup2
OUR ALLOWANCES.

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:49.271 region:rollup2
QUITE UNHAPPY BUT BECAUSE IT'S

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:51.406 region:rollup2
A MUCH LESS EXCITING MARKET THAT

01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:54.042 region:rollup2
WAY THE WAY WE IMPLEMENT THIS

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:57.079 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LOOKS A LOT MORE LIKE A

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:59.147 region:rollup2
REGULATION THAT IT DOES LIKE YOU

01:26:57.079 --> 01:27:00.882 region:rollup2
KNOW WE ALL COME OUT AND JUST

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:02.417 region:rollup2
DAY TRADE ALLOWANCES AS MUCH AS

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:05.120 region:rollup2
YOU WANT. WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:07.989 region:rollup2
KIND OF A PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.558 region:rollup2
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALSO

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:12.527 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:14.563 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS DOING ITS JOB IN

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:16.498 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REALLY SENDING THE

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:19.701 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:21.837 region:rollup2
INVESTING AND BE INVESTING NOW.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:24.706 region:rollup2
IN THINGS THAT ARE GONNA REDUCE

01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:27.275 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS OVER THE LONG RUN AS

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:29.377 region:rollup2
WE DRIVE TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:31.246 region:rollup2
SO I'M THAT THOSE OF THE COMING

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:34.783 region:rollup2
OF QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:36.685 region:rollup2
AT. AS WE COME UP WITH OUR

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:39.855 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO AMEND THE

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:42.524 region:rollup2
REGULATION IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:44.893 region:rollup2
NEW LEGISLATION OUT AND WE'VE

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:47.329 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM. A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:27:44.893 --> 01:27:50.332 region:rollup2
FOLKS ABOUT WHAT HOW THEY THINK

01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:55.137 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD DO IT AT WHERE BLAST

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:59.207 region:rollup2
AND I I MEAN THAT SINCERELY BY.

01:27:55.137 --> 01:28:02.811 region:rollup2
LARGE NUMBERS OF ECONOMISTS AND

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:04.713 region:rollup2
OTHER MARKET EXPERTS WHO HAVE

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:08.483 region:rollup2
IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:11.453 region:rollup2
BETTER AND WE HAVE TO TRY THAT

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:12.053 region:rollup2
REALLY LISTEN BUT ALSO THEN.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:18.660 region:rollup2
BAKE SOME MAKE SOME BUT WE'RE

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
ALSO

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:22.063 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SEEING SIGNS THAT

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:23.732 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TRYING TO SEND THE

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:26.001 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE. NOT

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:27.269 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN PURSUING ANY

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:28.637 region:rollup2
MEASURES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:28:27.269 --> 01:28:30.238 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:32.274 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF REDUCING

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:35.443 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES.

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:38.480 region:rollup2
IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:40.315 region:rollup2
WHERE THE CLEAN AIR ACT WAS?

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.083 region:rollup2
UNDER THREAT WAS IT A EPA WHICH

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.785 region:rollup2
REFUSING TO GRANT WAIVERS TO

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:45.921 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO DO OUR. MOTOR

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:48.156 region:rollup2
VEHICLE PROGRAMS THERE ARE STILL

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:50.458 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AT THE

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.527 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. BASED ON

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:54.829 region:rollup2
STATE LEVEL AUTHORITY.

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:56.298 region:rollup2
ZAREPHATH CERTAINLY MEASURES

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.566 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD TAKE WHERE.

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:59.568 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T DO THIS FOR FUEL

01:28:57.566 --> 01:29:01.570 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY WITH VEHICLES BUT

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:03.605 region:rollup2
FUEL EFFICIENCY IN VEHICLES

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:04.673 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW POLICIES

01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:06.274 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT AT THE

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.575 region:rollup2
ENERGY COMMISSION AND ELSEWHERE

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:08.076 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:10.779 region:rollup2
.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:12.747 region:rollup2
MAKING BUILDINGS ZERO THAT

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:15.183 region:rollup2
ENERGY THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:16.885 region:rollup2
YOU CAN LOOK AT AS ALTERNATIVES

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.153 region:rollup2
ON TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:20.155 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DOING.

01:29:18.153 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
MORE DIRECTLY WHERE THINGS WE

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:24.125 region:rollup2
CAN DO IN THE AS A STATE AND

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:24.993 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE AREA OF

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.261 region:rollup2
LAND USE AND.

01:29:24.993 --> 01:29:29.564 region:rollup2
PROMOTING.

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:31.566 region:rollup2
MORE BICYCLE AND WALKING

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.234 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES IN A LOT OF

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:32.801 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING ON

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:34.936 region:rollup2
NOW BUT THAT COULD BE GIVEN

01:29:32.801 --> 01:29:36.104 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:38.707 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS.

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:41.576 region:rollup2
AS PART OF STATE PROGRAM THAT

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:43.445 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED TO TO DEAL WHETHER

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:45.680 region:rollup2
A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WASN'T

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:49.117 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE BUT. I MEAN I THINK

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:51.119 region:rollup2
THE. I AM HOPEFUL THAT BECAUSE

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:53.788 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY OTHER STATES THAT

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:55.790 region:rollup2
ARE PURSUING. BOTH FOLLOWING OUR

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:57.292 region:rollup2
VEHICLE REGULATIONS AND LOOKING

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:59.594 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF OUR OTHER CLIMATE

01:29:57.292 --> 01:30:01.896 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AND MORE STATES

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:03.798 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOOKING TO GET INTO.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:05.567 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE PUTTING A PRICE ON

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:08.370 region:rollup2
CARBON.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:11.039 region:rollup2
AYE I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:12.641 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR MOMENTUM

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:13.775 region:rollup2
GOING.

01:30:12.641 --> 01:30:15.310 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISS SKINNER.

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:16.678 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:17.312 region:rollup2
THEIR PRESENTATION AND FOR TWO

01:30:16.678 --> 01:30:17.979 region:rollup2
CHEERS FOR.

01:30:17.312 --> 01:30:19.080 region:rollup2
HOLDING THE.

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.581 region:rollup2
HEARING.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.482 region:rollup2
COUPLE COMMENTS COUPLE

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:30:20.482 --> 01:30:23.351 region:rollup2
OF FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.120 region:rollup2
STEARNS ISSUE OF.

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:26.788 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS THAT

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.490 region:rollup2
CREATES THE UNANTICIPATED

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:30.292 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS IN HERE OF COURSE

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.059 region:rollup2
REFLECTING ON A LEASE OR CANYON

01:30:30.292 --> 01:30:33.895 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THERE'S ALSO.

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:36.264 region:rollup2
.

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:37.065 region:rollup2
WHICH WE CALL IT AND. JUST

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:40.602 region:rollup2
ESCAPED.

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:43.438 region:rollup2
WHETHER METHANE OR YES I FROM

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:46.441 region:rollup2
OUR WHOLE SYSTEM OF OUR NATURAL

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:48.076 region:rollup2
GAS SYSTEM. AND DE ESTIMATES ON

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:51.513 region:rollup2
THAT VERY SO THAT'S ONE BUT THE

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:51.746 region:rollup2
OTHER IS LIKE VW'S.

01:30:51.513 --> 01:30:54.616 region:rollup2
THEY'RE.

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:56.251 region:rollup2
.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:58.987 region:rollup2
ALL COLLEGE KI?M HAD TO MOMENT.

01:30:56.251 --> 01:31:00.121 region:rollup2
INCREASE KNOCKS RIVER NOW I

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:02.223 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW I'D IF EFFECTED ALL

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.591 region:rollup2
FUEL EFFICIENCY BUT KNOX'S A

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:06.127 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS OR INDIRECT

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:08.263 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS ANYWAY SO IT WAS.

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:10.165 region:rollup2
WHAT LEVEL? OF.

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:11.666 region:rollup2
.

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:14.502 region:rollup2
OF INCREASED GHGS

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:16.104 region:rollup2
THAT ACTION PUT NOW I RAISE

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:17.072 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES NOT THAT WE CAN SO

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:20.208 region:rollup2
MUCH.

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:22.143 region:rollup2
.

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:24.179 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT TYPE OF

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:26.014 region:rollup2
UNANTICIPATED EMISSIONS BUT WE

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:28.350 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IT SEEMS TO ME.

01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:30.285 region:rollup2
THAT FOR OUR SCOPING PLAN.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:33.455 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD IN FUTURE.

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:34.656 region:rollup2
YEAH I'D.

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:36.825 region:rollup2
A COULD AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT THEN

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:37.659 region:rollup2
AFFECT THE.

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:38.727 region:rollup2
LIKE THE MARGIN BUT YEAH AFTER A

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:41.329 region:rollup2
BLANK RIGHT FOR THE

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:42.330 region:rollup2
UNANTICIPATED INSTEAD OF THE

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.898 region:rollup2
ONLY.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:45.667 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THIS TARGET SO

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:47.235 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW AND BOOM

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:48.803 region:rollup2
BOOM BOOM ONLY ON WHICH WE KNOW.

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:50.872 region:rollup2
JUST A COMMENT QUICKLY ABOUT

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:51.806 region:rollup2
pTHAT BEFORE I.

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:54.175 region:rollup2
COHEN WELL.

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:55.744 region:rollup2
YES IT YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:58.012 region:rollup2
POINT JUST ON THE ON THE

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:59.914 region:rollup2
VOLKSWAGEN SITUATION WE WORKED

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:02.650 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THE OBAMA

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:04.219 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.855 region:rollup2
THAT IN OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTION

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:08.456 region:rollup2
AFTER WE UNCOVERED THE FRAUD.

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:10.458 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEFEAT DEVICES THAT

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:12.794 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY WAS USING THAT WE

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:13.962 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY WERE WORKING TOWARDS

01:32:12.794 --> 01:32:16.297 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR WHICH WE SHOULD BE

01:32:13.962 --> 01:32:18.933 region:rollup2
NORMAL. BUT ALSO THAT WE WERE

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:21.403 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:23.772 region:rollup2
PUT MONEY INTO A SPECIAL FUND.

01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:26.474 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO OB ALLOW

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:29.043 region:rollup2
FOR AYE EVERY STATE THAT WAS

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:30.979 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY THIS WHICH WAS EVERY

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:33.681 region:rollup2
STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AYE AND

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:35.984 region:rollup2
AND TRIBES AS WELL ACTUALLY TO.

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:39.020 region:rollup2
A RECEIVE FUNDS THAT COULD BE

01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:40.288 region:rollup2
USED TO CREATE NEW REDUCTIONS

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.290 region:rollup2
AND KNOCKS.

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:44.759 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD OFFSET LITERALLY

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:46.528 region:rollup2
POUND FOR POUND THE ADDITIONAL

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.695 region:rollup2
KNOCK STAFF COURSE THAT KNOCKS

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:49.464 region:rollup2
THAT WAS RELEASED AS A RESULT OF

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:51.232 region:rollup2
A VOLKSWAGEN DID IS ALREADY OUT

01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:52.967 region:rollup2
THERE THE ATMOSPHERE DOING ALL

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:54.836 region:rollup2
THE HARM THAT IT COULD DO. BUT

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:58.807 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WE HAVE THE

01:32:54.836 --> 01:33:00.708 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO

01:32:58.807 --> 01:33:03.645 region:rollup2
HELP TURN OVER THE DIESEL FLEET

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:05.513 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN WAYS THAT WELL.

01:33:03.645 --> 01:33:07.082 region:rollup2
BILL THEN PERMANENT KNOCKS

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:09.284 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS WITH THE MONEY THAT

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:12.287 region:rollup2
WILL BE GETTING OUT OF THAT FUND

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:13.688 region:rollup2
SO I THINK ALL IN ALL THAT WAS

01:33:12.287 --> 01:33:16.057 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT WAS A TERRIFIC

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:17.826 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:19.427 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I JUST CAN'T RESIST

01:33:17.826 --> 01:33:20.495 region:rollup2
THIS BUT THE ARM WE'VE BEEN TOLD

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:22.063 region:rollup2
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:23.465 region:rollup2
NOW DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:25.667 region:rollup2
DO THOSE KINDS OF SETTLEMENTS IN

01:33:23.465 --> 01:33:27.969 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE SO. WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:30.572 region:rollup2
PENDING AYE CASE AGAINST ANOTHER

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:33.541 region:rollup2
COMPANY THAT WAS DOING SOMETHING

01:33:30.572 --> 01:33:35.710 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR.

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:38.379 region:rollup2
TO A VOLKSWAGEN DEAD AND.

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:41.349 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT BE GETTING THE SAME

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:43.017 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF HELP AND COLLABORATION

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:45.520 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. AT WITH THE TRUMP

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:47.455 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE DID IN

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.191 region:rollup2
THE PAST BOB BUT.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:53.761 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE CERTAINTY THAT

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:59.367 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OF ACHIEVING.

01:33:53.761 --> 01:34:01.503 region:rollup2
PRECISE LEVELS OF REDUCTION.

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:02.670 region:rollup2
AS THE SCIENCE OF THIS IS SORT

01:34:01.503 --> 01:34:03.972 region:rollup2
OF IN ITS INFANCY I MEAN YOU CAN

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.073 region:rollup2
MEASURE CO TWO DIRECTLY COMING

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:06.007 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE STACK.

01:34:05.073 --> 01:34:08.176 region:rollup2
BUT TO MEASURE.

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:09.110 region:rollup2
IN WITH GREAT PRECISION THE.

01:34:08.176 --> 01:34:10.311 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS OF.

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:12.447 region:rollup2
METHANE THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:13.948 region:rollup2
A PIPELINE OR UMPS AID MULTIPLE

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:15.683 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCES.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.718 region:rollup2
WHO YOU WOULD HAVE TO AT

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:18.253 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED A KIND OF MONITORING

01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:19.154 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE DON'T HALF NOW I

01:34:18.253 --> 01:34:20.722 region:rollup2
MEAN YOU CAN DO A PRETTY GOOD

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:22.290 region:rollup2
JOB OF ESTIMATING BASED ON? THE

01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:24.092 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT'S PUT IN VERSUS THE

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:26.027 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT YOU END UP WITH AT

01:34:24.092 --> 01:34:27.729 region:rollup2
THE OTHER END OF THE SYSTEM BUT.

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:28.696 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:30.865 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:32.133 region:rollup2
KNOW. ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:34.869 region:rollup2
WHERE ALL THOSE EMISSIONS ARE

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:37.438 region:rollup2
COMING FROM SO.

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:38.506 region:rollup2
AND DO THAT.

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:40.108 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF THE CHANGES

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.943 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE REALLY

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:44.512 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT TIGHTEN UP ON THE

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:46.781 region:rollup2
WHOLE SYSTEMS OR THAT SUBSTITUTE

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:49.117 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY LESS POLLUTING.

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:51.352 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:53.121 region:rollup2
OVERALL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:54.422 region:rollup2
JUST KEEP PATCHING. THE CURRENT

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:56.758 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT REALLY ARE LOOKING

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:58.393 region:rollup2
FOR MORE TRANSFORMATIVE KINDS OF

01:34:56.758 --> 01:35:00.995 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:02.764 region:rollup2
SO WE. I THINK IT IS WORTH

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:02.897 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING IN FUTURE UPDATES.

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:05.500 region:rollup2
A.

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:07.502 region:rollup2
.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:10.071 region:rollup2
THE PORTION OF THIS SCOPING PLAN

01:35:07.502 --> 01:35:12.874 region:rollup2
ON THE ON ANTICIPATED RUBEN.

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:14.709 region:rollup2
SPEAKING TOWARDS THAT OF.

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:16.010 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.946 region:rollup2
OR GO TO THE LA OR REPORT FOR

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.480 region:rollup2
MINUTES SO.

01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:22.150 region:rollup2
YOU FOCUSED ON AND.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:24.519 region:rollup2
.

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:26.354 region:rollup2
SHE BROWN YOU FOCUSED ON THE.

01:35:24.519 --> 01:35:28.957 region:rollup2
PORTION.

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:30.758 region:rollup2
OF THAT IF THESE ALLOWANCES THAT

01:35:28.957 --> 01:35:31.893 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN BANKED.

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
GET USED INSTEAD OF THE

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:35.897 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS THAT WE THAT THE CAP

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:38.266 region:rollup2
AND TRADE SECTION AT LEAST WILL

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:40.835 region:rollup2
NOT FULLY MEET THE TARGETS THAT

01:35:38.266 --> 01:35:42.136 region:rollup2
WE INTENT NOW. WHAT WHAT WASN'T

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:43.504 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED WHICH I THINK IS

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:45.340 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CLARIFY IN THE

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:48.376 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION IS THAT?

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:50.511 region:rollup2
THE IN THE UPDATED SCOPING PLAN

01:35:48.376 --> 01:35:54.282 region:rollup2
AND AND MISS NICHOLS YOU CAN.

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:54.816 region:rollup2
CLARIFY. DE THE AMOUNT OF SO WE

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:55.617 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN S. B. THIRTY TWO

01:35:54.816 --> 01:35:57.685 region:rollup2
GOALS.

01:35:55.617 --> 01:35:59.220 region:rollup2
YET DID SCOPING PLAN HAS

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:01.222 region:rollup2
MEASURES IN VARIOUS THINGS AND

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.557 region:rollup2
IT SHOWS WHAT PERCENT OF THAT

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:04.192 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS IS A

01:36:02.557 --> 01:36:05.727 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT.

01:36:04.192 --> 01:36:06.194 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT

01:36:05.727 --> 01:36:07.495 region:rollup2
OF.

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:09.030 region:rollup2
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE S. B.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:11.099 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO GOAL IN THEIR CABIN

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:12.634 region:rollup2
TREES ARE CORRECT.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:15.303 region:rollup2
YEAH I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT

01:36:12.634 --> 01:36:17.105 region:rollup2
NUMBER AND I THINK THE NEXT JOB

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:18.473 region:rollup2
FORTY THIRD LITTLE DOES NOT

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:19.207 region:rollup2
FORTY SNUFF FOR YOU CAN GET JUST

01:36:18.473 --> 01:36:21.542 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:22.377 region:rollup2
MAYBE THIRTY FIVE BUT IT'S

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:23.878 region:rollup2
UNDER FORTY.

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:25.680 region:rollup2
NOW EVEN IF

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:27.649 region:rollup2
IT'S A. VERY WE HAVE THE WORST

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.350 region:rollup2
CASE SCENARIO YOU DESCRIBED AS

01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:31.419 region:rollup2
FAR AS I CAN TELL YOU WOULD

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:33.187 region:rollup2
STILL KNOCKER TOTAL TARGET OFF

01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:35.890 region:rollup2
BY LESS THAN TEN PERCENT.

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:37.625 region:rollup2
GIVEN WHAT PERCENT IT IS OF OUR

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:40.395 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE INTENT.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:41.129 region:rollup2
SO NOW THAT'S NOT TO DIMINISH

01:36:40.395 --> 01:36:43.631 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:46.134 region:rollup2
RAISED BUT I WONDER IF THE LA

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:46.701 region:rollup2
ALWAYS PLANNING. IN A SIMILAR

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.870 region:rollup2
SUSSMAN ON THE WHOLE SCOPING

01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:51.406 region:rollup2
PLAN.

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:53.307 region:rollup2
AND THEY AN IVORY SICK BECAUSE.

01:36:51.406 --> 01:36:54.842 region:rollup2
WHILE THE CONTINUATION CAP AND

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:58.746 region:rollup2
TRADE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WAS

01:36:54.842 --> 01:37:00.515 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY VERY NON.

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:02.417 region:rollup2
HE DID A.

01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:04.185 region:rollup2
IT DOMINATED MUCH OF OUR SESSION

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:06.688 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:08.256 region:rollup2
FOR. ALL OF US ON IN THE

01:37:06.688 --> 01:37:10.158 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE TO

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:11.759 region:rollup2
REALIZE IT IS ONLY THIRTY

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:16.097 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL GOAL.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:17.565 region:rollup2
AND SO IT AS WE FOCUS ON.

01:37:16.097 --> 01:37:19.167 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS BEFORE US THAT WE

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:20.902 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ACHIEVE

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:23.604 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE

01:37:20.902 --> 01:37:24.572 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TO STAY FOCUSED ON?

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:26.607 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT.

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:29.510 region:rollup2
ANYWAY COMMENT AND THEN ALL S.

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:29.877 region:rollup2
DIVE TO OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.612 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M GONNA.

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:32.180 region:rollup2
.

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:34.415 region:rollup2
I GUESS.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:36.250 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:38.252 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHERE THE THE TEN

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:40.221 region:rollup2
PERCENT SORT OF A LOOK ON ONLY

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:41.689 region:rollup2
ON THIRTY PERCENT OF.

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.957 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE S. B.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:45.593 region:rollup2
THIRTY TO CALL.

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:46.461 region:rollup2
AND EVEN UNDER YOUR CHART.

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:47.995 region:rollup2
IF ALL THE BANK EMISSIONS ARE

01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:49.630 region:rollup2
USED.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:51.532 region:rollup2
WHILE EMISSIONS WOULD BE HIGHER

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:54.869 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT.

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:55.870 region:rollup2
THE INTENT IS FOR CAPITATE

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:57.472 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEY WILL NOT BE HIGHER

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.506 region:rollup2
THAN THEY ARE TODAY.

01:37:57.472 --> 01:38:00.641 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD STILL ACHIEVE

01:37:58.506 --> 01:38:03.311 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:04.712 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT I'VE MY ESTIMATE TEN

01:38:03.311 --> 01:38:06.381 region:rollup2
PERCENT WAS A ROUGH BACK IN THE

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:08.082 region:rollup2
ENVELOPE BUT THAT EVEN IF THE

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:10.051 region:rollup2
WORST CASE SCENARIO OF BANKED

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:12.253 region:rollup2
WE'D ONLY BE OFF BY THE OF THE

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.787 region:rollup2
S. B. THIRTY TWO TARGET BY LESS

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:14.722 region:rollup2
THAN TEN PERCENT OF TOTAL

01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:15.923 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.792 region:rollup2
YEAH SO I THINK.

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:20.228 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WHAT WE CANNOT WAIT OUT

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:21.896 region:rollup2
IN THE CHART WAS THAT?

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:23.231 region:rollup2
IT WOULDN'T BE THAT IT WOULD BE

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.432 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT LAST THING KIND

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:25.833 region:rollup2
OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:38:24.432 --> 01:38:26.968 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH CAP AND TRADE

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:29.337 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE TRIED TO LAY OUT

01:38:26.968 --> 01:38:30.471 region:rollup2
AS THE SCENARIO WHERE. YOU EVEN

01:38:29.337 --> 01:38:32.140 region:rollup2
IF CAP AND TRADE AS THEIR

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:34.809 region:rollup2
OVERALL EMISSIONS ARE EVEN

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.376 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN WHAT

01:38:34.809 --> 01:38:37.111 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL TARGET IS SO IT'S

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:38.646 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:40.248 region:rollup2
SORT OF YOU KNOW THIRTY PERCENT

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:42.650 region:rollup2
OF THE MISSION REDUCTIONS.

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:44.685 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED FROM CAP AND TRADE

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.319 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF A SCENARIO WHERE

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.154 region:rollup2
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:48.556 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:38:46.154 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT ARE IN PLACE AND

01:38:48.556 --> 01:38:51.392 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:52.760 region:rollup2
THINGS AND EVEN PERHAPS SOME

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:54.162 region:rollup2
INITIAL REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.229 region:rollup2
WITH CAP AND TRADE. YOU COULD

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:57.131 region:rollup2
STILL FIND YOURSELF IN A

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:58.332 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE OVERALL

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.834 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:02.370 region:rollup2
FROM ALL SOURCES.

01:38:59.834 --> 01:39:04.005 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CAP UNDER THE CAP ARE

01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:04.605 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THIRTY

01:39:04.005 --> 01:39:06.707 region:rollup2
PERCENT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:07.775 region:rollup2
ACTUAL TARGET IS SO I THINK

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:10.645 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S JUST.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:12.680 region:rollup2
AND BE HAPPY TO COME OUT.

01:39:10.645 --> 01:39:14.982 region:rollup2
CHAT ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.918 region:rollup2
SORT OF HOW IT RECONCILING THOSE

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:18.419 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

01:39:16.918 --> 01:39:20.888 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE CHART ON THAT YOU

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:23.124 region:rollup2
REFERENCE TO US ON PAGE EIGHT.

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:24.959 region:rollup2
IS SOLELY AND ONLY.

01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:26.661 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS UNDER THE UNDER THE

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:28.663 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE TARGET NOT THE

01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:29.897 region:rollup2
FULL AB THIRTY IT'S S. B. THIRTY

01:39:28.663 --> 01:39:32.166 region:rollup2
TWO PACKAGE THEY ARE THERE

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:33.835 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS UNDER THE CAP FROM

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:35.470 region:rollup2
CAPS SOURCES.

01:39:33.835 --> 01:39:35.903 region:rollup2
SO THAT INCLUDES KIND OF

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.805 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FUELS

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:40.575 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:42.009 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL SOURCES.

01:39:40.575 --> 01:39:44.445 region:rollup2
THAT THE ONLY BANK ALLOWANCES

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:45.980 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOWED UNDER CAP AND TRADE

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:47.515 region:rollup2
NOT UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.818 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT THE THE OTHER.

01:39:47.515 --> 01:39:51.919 region:rollup2
AND MISSION REDUCTION POLICIES.

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:53.588 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ARE KIND OF

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:55.489 region:rollup2
IMPLICITLY INCORPORATED IN THAT

01:39:53.588 --> 01:39:57.325 region:rollup2
RED LINE THAT YOU SEE THERE SO

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:59.193 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF STEADY DECLINE. IN

01:39:57.325 --> 01:40:00.628 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS RECKON ME DUE TO A

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:02.396 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF FACTORS IN THIS

01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:03.664 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR EXAMPLE COULD BE JUST

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:05.299 region:rollup2
OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:07.735 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. AS

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:08.836 region:rollup2
WELL AS OR THE EFFECTS OF OTHER

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.904 region:rollup2
CLIMB UP POLICIES THAT WE HAVE

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.539 region:rollup2
THEIR AFFECTING THOSE OVERALL

01:40:09.904 --> 01:40:12.940 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:13.975 region:rollup2
SO WE TRIED TO LAY OUT ISN'T

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.476 region:rollup2
SCENARIO WHERE YEAH THERE THERE

01:40:13.975 --> 01:40:16.577 region:rollup2
THOSE POLICIES ARE HAVING SOME

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.578 region:rollup2
EFFECT OF DRIVING DOWN.

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:19.881 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:21.782 region:rollup2
.

01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:23.084 region:rollup2
AND YET STILL WERE KIND OF WITH

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:24.552 region:rollup2
THIS LARGE BANK OF ALLOWANCES

01:40:23.084 --> 01:40:26.254 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ISN'T

01:40:24.552 --> 01:40:27.121 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY NSURING THAT WERE

01:40:26.254 --> 01:40:28.356 region:rollup2
STILL MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:30.391 region:rollup2
GOAL.

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:33.828 region:rollup2
.

01:40:30.391 --> 01:40:35.196 region:rollup2
OKAY I'VE. I THINK I HAVE TO.

01:40:33.828 --> 01:40:39.667 region:rollup2
READ YOUR REPORT CLOSER BECAUSE

01:40:35.196 --> 01:40:41.636 region:rollup2
YOUR CHART IT.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:42.236 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE HARD TO INTERPRET

01:40:41.636 --> 01:40:43.771 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED FROM

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.938 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT. THAT WAY.

01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:47.275 region:rollup2
AND.

01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:50.444 region:rollup2
.

01:40:47.275 --> 01:40:51.445 region:rollup2
DID.

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:52.813 region:rollup2
THAT ON THE IF I MAY IT OF HOCUS

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:54.749 region:rollup2
IS ALL THE ATTENTION ON THE CAP

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:55.883 region:rollup2
AND TRADE PROGRAM YEAH AND NOT

01:40:54.749 --> 01:40:57.418 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ON THE.

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:59.153 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS OF THE OTHER

01:40:57.418 --> 01:41:00.955 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WOULD LEAD

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:01.556 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT ARE UNDER THIS

01:41:00.955 --> 01:41:03.891 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:06.561 region:rollup2
TO.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:08.396 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP VERSUS USE ALLOWANCES

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:10.164 region:rollup2
HOLD ONTO ALLOWANCES AND THAT'S

01:41:08.396 --> 01:41:12.500 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT MAKES THE WHOLE.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:14.769 region:rollup2
MARKET SYSTEM LESS THAN

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.236 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY PREDICTABLE AS BECAUSE

01:41:14.769 --> 01:41:17.004 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW AN

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:19.006 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL%

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:21.142 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE OF A COMPANY IS GOING

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:23.678 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT. THE FUTURE YOU DON'T

01:41:21.142 --> 01:41:25.279 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TECHNOLOGY PRICES ARE

01:41:23.678 --> 01:41:26.948 region:rollup2
GOING TO COME DOWN WHICH.

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:29.684 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO FAR BASED ON

01:41:26.948 --> 01:41:30.284 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WE KEEP FINDING THAT

01:41:29.684 --> 01:41:32.420 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WHETHER IT'S SOLAR

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:34.822 region:rollup2
OR.

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:37.124 region:rollup2
WHATEVER OUR GETS CHEAPER RATHER

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:39.126 region:rollup2
THAN MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:40.895 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND UP ACTUALLY DECIDING

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:42.830 region:rollup2
TO CLEAN UP VERSUS.

01:41:40.895 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
BUYING ALLOWANCES AND THEREFORE

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:48.002 region:rollup2
THE ALLOWANCES BECOME LESS

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:49.437 region:rollup2
USEFUL AND LESS IMPORTANT EVEN

01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:52.606 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE OUT THERE.

01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:54.375 region:rollup2
SO I PAID THEM WE DON'T I'M

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:55.810 region:rollup2
ASSURE OTHER PEOPLE MAY ONE OF

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:57.712 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE BUT I DO WANNA GO

01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:59.680 region:rollup2
DEEPER IT NOW UNTIL I. READ THIS

01:41:57.712 --> 01:42:00.848 region:rollup2
HOLY SILICON ASK THE QUESTIONS

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.850 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY BUT.

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:05.119 region:rollup2
WAY IN MY LOOKING AT IT AND FROM

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:07.755 region:rollup2
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. FIRE

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:09.390 region:rollup2
HERDED AS THAT THIEF IF THE

01:42:07.755 --> 01:42:10.658 region:rollup2
COMPANIES USE THE FULL AMOUNT A

01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:13.561 region:rollup2
BANK ALLOWANCES.

01:42:10.658 --> 01:42:16.197 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GO ABOVE WHAT THEY'RE

01:42:13.561 --> 01:42:17.565 region:rollup2
CAP IS UNDER CAP AND TRADE BUT

01:42:16.197 --> 01:42:18.1000 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD NECESSARILY

01:42:17.565 --> 01:42:20.801 region:rollup2
BRING US.

01:42:18.1000 --> 01:42:22.770 region:rollup2
ABOVE.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:24.772 region:rollup2
OUR TOTAL S. B. THIRTY TWO

01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:26.107 region:rollup2
CHICHI REDUCTION GOAL NOW AGAIN

01:42:24.772 --> 01:42:28.843 region:rollup2
ALL LOOK AT IT MORE CAREFULLY

01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:30.478 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BRINGS ME. TO.

01:42:28.843 --> 01:42:32.346 region:rollup2
IF SINCE THE HEARINGS ON SCOPING

01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:34.515 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT AS MISS NICHOLS

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:36.450 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT. OUR LARGEST SOURCE

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:37.985 region:rollup2
OF EMISSIONS IS TRANSPORTATION.

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.886 region:rollup2
AND TRANSPORTATION IS ONLY

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:39.887 region:rollup2
MINIMALLY AFFECTED BY CAP AND

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:41.689 region:rollup2
TRADE.

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:43.991 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:45.626 region:rollup2
SO WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY OTHER

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:47.161 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THE SCOPING PLAN

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:49.430 region:rollup2
AROUND TRANSPORTATION.

01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:52.299 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT.

01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:53.267 region:rollup2
FOR ME. THAT THE.

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:54.201 region:rollup2
OR CALL ABSENCE

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:56.637 region:rollup2
OF CPAS

01:42:54.201 --> 01:43:00.675 region:rollup2
CIVIC.

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:02.510 region:rollup2
GHG REDUCTION TARGETS IN VARIOUS

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:06.013 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION.

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:09.684 region:rollup2
SYRIA GIVEN HOW MUCH

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:12.353 region:rollup2
OF OUR GIGI EMISSIONS IT IS.

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:15.556 region:rollup2
I'M GIVES ME SOME CONCERN.

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:17.258 region:rollup2
AND AND I AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:18.993 region:rollup2
HAVING GOOD SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:20.861 region:rollup2
TO LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS I

01:43:18.993 --> 01:43:22.229 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE'S WE'D YOU KNOW

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:23.397 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING LOTS OF WORK ON FOR

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:25.1000 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ELECTRIFYING

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:28.969 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION. BUT AGAIN I'M

01:43:25.1000 --> 01:43:30.071 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ABSENCE OF.

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:34.675 region:rollup2
MORE SOLID.

01:43:30.071 --> 01:43:35.643 region:rollup2
.

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:36.711 region:rollup2
TARGETS RUN THE TRANSFERRED IN

01:43:35.643 --> 01:43:39.447 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:40.948 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS GROWTH.

01:43:39.447 --> 01:43:42.516 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN I THINK A SAID AN

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:43.818 region:rollup2
AND INTERESTING AND USEFUL

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:46.554 region:rollup2
COMMENT IT IS.

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:48.389 region:rollup2
TRUE THAT THIS SCOPING PLAN

01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:50.124 region:rollup2
REALLY BUILDS ON PASSED SCOPING

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:51.659 region:rollup2
PLANS AND PASS SCOPING PLANTS

01:43:50.124 --> 01:43:53.461 region:rollup2
HAVE BUILT ON THE EXISTING

01:43:51.659 --> 01:43:55.396 region:rollup2
REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT WERE

01:43:53.461 --> 01:43:56.997 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN PLACE. AND IT COULD

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:58.733 region:rollup2
BE THAT IF WE STEPPED BACK AND

01:43:56.997 --> 01:44:01.302 region:rollup2
SAID LET'S LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:03.037 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND FIGURE

01:44:01.302 --> 01:44:05.005 region:rollup2
OUT HOW YOU WOULD GET MORE.

01:44:03.037 --> 01:44:07.908 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS OUT OF THAT.

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:09.410 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT COME UP WITH SOME

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:11.312 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT.

01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.013 region:rollup2
IT'S A MY TWO LAST QUESTIONS ARE

01:44:11.312 --> 01:44:15.015 region:rollup2
ONE IS CARBON IN.

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:17.451 region:rollup2
IN HOUSEHOLDS

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:19.620 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAVE ROBUST

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:19.820 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WE'VE

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.289 region:rollup2
GOT.

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:24.558 region:rollup2
A FIFTY PERCENT.

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:25.593 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD NOW

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:27.128 region:rollup2
BEFORE ASSIST POTENTIAL FOR A

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:28.229 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT.

01:44:27.128 --> 01:44:29.296 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CARBON

01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:30.931 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE COASTAL

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:32.600 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.403 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS. THROUGH THEIR

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:36.604 region:rollup2
WATER HEATING THEIR SPACE SEEING

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:38.639 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:39.573 region:rollup2
.

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:42.309 region:rollup2
OVENS IN SUCH DEMAND.

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:45.813 region:rollup2
.

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:46.480 region:rollup2
D. EFFICIENCY MEASURES.

01:44:45.813 --> 01:44:49.517 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.484 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY AIMED THEIR AIMED AT

01:44:49.517 --> 01:44:52.453 region:rollup2
DOING THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY BUT

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:53.721 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY DE CARBON ICING

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:54.588 region:rollup2
THAT PORTION OF THE CARBON IN

01:44:53.721 --> 01:44:56.824 region:rollup2
OUR HOUSEHOLDS.

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:59.059 region:rollup2
AND.

01:44:56.824 --> 01:45:00.794 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN DOESN'T REALLY

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:02.229 region:rollup2
REFERENCE IT MUCH EITHER AND I

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.931 region:rollup2
WONDERED IF CARP IS GIVEN MUCH

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:06.400 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THAT.

01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:08.269 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK WHAT THE FOCUS OF A

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.037 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS ON NATURAL GAS HAS

01:45:08.269 --> 01:45:10.905 region:rollup2
COME MORE THROUGH THAT SHORT

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:13.908 region:rollup2
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS.

01:45:10.905 --> 01:45:14.975 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:45:13.908 --> 01:45:17.077 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT.

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.712 region:rollup2
WAYS YOU COULD.

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:20.481 region:rollup2
MAKE A LARGER MORE DRAMATIC

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:23.083 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS AND.

01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:26.153 region:rollup2
I KNOW THERE'S A.

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:28.522 region:rollup2
A. SUGGESTION THAT IN THE FUTURE

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:30.357 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD NOT. BE USED NATURAL

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.625 region:rollup2
GAS AT ALL FOR SOME OF THE

01:45:30.357 --> 01:45:33.527 region:rollup2
PURPOSES THE AND WE WHERE YOU

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:35.029 region:rollup2
COULD SUBSTITUTE ELECTRIFICATION

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:38.465 region:rollup2
AND THE ELECTRICITY COULD COME

01:45:35.029 --> 01:45:39.500 region:rollup2
FROM RENEWABLE. RESOURCES

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:41.135 region:rollup2
AND THE NATIONAL GAS INDUSTRY

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:44.471 region:rollup2
HAS VERY.

01:45:41.135 --> 01:45:47.208 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY REFUTED THAT IDEA

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:49.343 region:rollup2
USING AS THE NOTION OF A SORT OF

01:45:47.208 --> 01:45:52.046 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD FIND

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:54.481 region:rollup2
WAYS TO GET MORE GHG REDUCTIONS

01:45:52.046 --> 01:45:57.718 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM. THROUGH.

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:59.954 region:rollup2
VARIOUS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS AS

01:45:57.718 --> 01:46:01.755 region:rollup2
YET NOT REALLY TESTED THAT BUT

01:45:59.954 --> 01:46:03.524 region:rollup2
OR BUT THAT THEY THEY COULD BE

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:04.825 region:rollup2
TESTING THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:07.394 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD USE

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:10.331 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS TO ACTUALLY. REDUCE

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:12.967 region:rollup2
A CO TWO EMISSIONS OVERALL FROM.

01:46:10.331 --> 01:46:14.902 region:rollup2
FROM MANY ACTIVITIES INCLUDING

01:46:12.967 --> 01:46:16.737 region:rollup2
DRIVING IF THEY USE SOME OF THAT

01:46:14.902 --> 01:46:18.939 region:rollup2
TO MAKE HYDROGEN IS MORE OF IT

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:21.008 region:rollup2
TO MAKE HYDROGEN TO. OPERATE.

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:23.410 region:rollup2
.

01:46:21.008 --> 01:46:24.845 region:rollup2
TO OPERATE JET FUEL CELLS SO AB

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:26.413 region:rollup2
ED USE STORAGE AS A WAY THAT.

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:28.515 region:rollup2
.

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:30.818 region:rollup2
PUT TASK GAS

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:32.953 region:rollup2
AB BACK INTO THE SYSTEM SO

01:46:30.818 --> 01:46:35.422 region:rollup2
ANYWAY I AM I THINK THESE.

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:37.224 region:rollup2
KIND OF BIG POLICY ISSUES THAT

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:39.860 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE LIKE THAT BUT.

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:41.996 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME OUR FOCUS HAS

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.497 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN MORE ON WORKING WITH

01:46:41.996 --> 01:46:45.332 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHER

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:46.967 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT HAVE KIND OF

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:49.503 region:rollup2
DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY OVER

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:51.305 region:rollup2
BUILDING. AND EFFICIENCY OR

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:53.173 region:rollup2
CITING OF FACILITIES AND SO

01:46:51.305 --> 01:46:56.910 region:rollup2
FORTH RATHER THAN KIND OF TRY TO

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:58.979 region:rollup2
TAKE ON THAT THAT WHOLE ISSUE.

01:46:56.910 --> 01:47:01.282 region:rollup2
THEN LASTLY I WONDERED SORRY I

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:03.083 region:rollup2
WONDERED IF CARD HAD LOOKED AT.

01:47:01.282 --> 01:47:05.786 region:rollup2
ANY DATA.

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:07.554 region:rollup2
ON THE GHG REDUCTION DURING THE

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:09.490 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF THE GOVERNOR'S WATER

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:11.625 region:rollup2
USE REDUCTION ORDER.

01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:12.726 region:rollup2
.

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:15.062 region:rollup2
I HAD SEEN SOME DATA.

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:17.164 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:47:15.062 --> 01:47:18.699 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE WATER USE REDUCTION.

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:20.267 region:rollup2
THAT ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:47:18.699 --> 01:47:21.936 region:rollup2
THERE WAS WHATEVER LESS WATER

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:25.005 region:rollup2
BEING PUMPED LESS WATER BEING

01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:26.607 region:rollup2
HEATED LESS WATER IT AND WE KNOW

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:29.510 region:rollup2
THAT FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY PERCENT

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:30.577 region:rollup2
OF ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE IS.

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:31.645 region:rollup2
DO YOU JUST WATER PUMPING ALONE.

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:34.315 region:rollup2
.

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:36.150 region:rollup2
AND.

01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:37.184 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AGAIN THE DATA I SAW.

01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:38.085 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS.

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:39.653 region:rollup2
.

01:47:38.085 --> 01:47:42.056 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:44.325 region:rollup2
FROM A SMALL SOURCE OR WHETHER

01:47:42.056 --> 01:47:46.627 region:rollup2
IT WAS LARGER. BUT IT SEEMED

01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:48.595 region:rollup2
COMPELLING AND I WONDERED IF ANY

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:49.096 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES WERE LOOKING AT

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:51.632 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:47:49.096 --> 01:47:52.700 region:rollup2
THE WATER BOARD I BELIEVE HAS A

01:47:51.632 --> 01:47:53.967 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITH.

01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:56.770 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE.

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:58.639 region:rollup2
REGISTRY TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL

01:47:56.770 --> 01:48:00.774 region:rollup2
FOR LOOKING AT EXACTLY THAT.

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:03.210 region:rollup2
ISSUE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:05.446 region:rollup2
MORE WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:06.980 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT

01:48:05.446 --> 01:48:08.782 region:rollup2
TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT'S NOT

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:11.051 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEEN COMPLETED.

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:13.020 region:rollup2
THERE DEFINITELY IS CONTROVERSY

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:15.289 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHAT

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.824 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN WATER IS CONSERVED

01:48:15.289 --> 01:48:19.259 region:rollup2
IS IT JUST SENT SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:48:16.824 --> 01:48:21.428 region:rollup2
AND IF SO HOW DOES THE ENERGY

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:22.963 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET SAVED IN THE LONG

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:24.832 region:rollup2
RUN. ME THIS NO QUESTION IF YOU

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:26.100 region:rollup2
MAKE THE PUMPS MORE EFFICIENT

01:48:24.832 --> 01:48:27.234 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE.

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.869 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS BECAUSE THERE'S

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
WHATEVER PUMPING IS DOWN WILL BE

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:32.539 region:rollup2
USING CLASS AT WILL BE CREATING

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:35.075 region:rollup2
FEWER EMISSIONS BUT IF YOU TALK

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:36.410 region:rollup2
ABOUT WATER AS HOT AS A WHOLE AS

01:48:35.075 --> 01:48:38.045 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM. WITHIN THE STATE OF

01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:40.247 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA YOU REALLY HAVE TO

01:48:38.045 --> 01:48:42.049 region:rollup2
LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT WHERE IT

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:43.283 region:rollup2
GOES AND AND BUT GETS DONE OF

01:48:42.049 --> 01:48:44.551 region:rollup2
THAT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.953 region:rollup2
USEFUL GIVEN THAT WE HAD A

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:48.055 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME WAS THE

01:48:45.953 --> 01:48:50.657 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S REDUCTION ORDER IN

01:48:48.055 --> 01:48:52.459 region:rollup2
EFFECT ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS. AM.

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:54.194 region:rollup2
SO THE MAN FEDERAL RATE OF TIME

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:57.097 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE CAN PROBABLY GET THE

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:58.599 region:rollup2
DATA I'M FROM ME AGAIN I'M NOT

01:48:57.097 --> 01:49:00.367 region:rollup2
GOING TO TRY TO SPECULATE WOULD

01:48:58.599 --> 01:49:02.169 region:rollup2
BE THE BEST SOURCES BUT WE COULD

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:04.271 region:rollup2
BE SINCE WE KNOW THE WINDOW. IF

01:49:02.169 --> 01:49:06.573 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND WE KNOW WHAT WATER

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:09.343 region:rollup2
USE REDUCTION WAS ACHIEVED

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:11.779 region:rollup2
COULDN'T WE GET USING THAT. TIME

01:49:09.343 --> 01:49:13.914 region:rollup2
PERIOD DATA FROM THE THE

01:49:11.779 --> 01:49:16.950 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ENTITIES TO LOOK AT

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:18.619 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE WAS A ASSOCIATED.

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:21.522 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN.

01:49:18.619 --> 01:49:24.024 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY YOU'RE NOW TO THE

01:49:21.522 --> 01:49:26.760 region:rollup2
OTHER USE. WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:29.863 region:rollup2
US SOME INSIGHT RATHER THAN.

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:32.433 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGREED WE WE DON'T KNOW

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:33.667 region:rollup2
BROADLEAF WHETHER THE SAVING OF

01:49:32.433 --> 01:49:35.302 region:rollup2
WATER IN FACT

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.670 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST SAVING IT HERE AND

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:38.238 region:rollup2
ISN'T NECESSARILY GET USED

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:40.441 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:42.276 region:rollup2
THIS SNAPSHOT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

01:49:40.441 --> 01:49:43.944 region:rollup2
TO GET SOME REAL DATA.

01:49:42.276 --> 01:49:45.446 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD JOB FOR THE

01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:47.681 region:rollup2
ALEJO.

01:49:45.446 --> 01:49:49.249 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:50.984 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHARLIE.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:52.352 region:rollup2
THAT WAS IT.

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:53.387 region:rollup2
DID YOU MIND IF I. JUST ADD ONE

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.988 region:rollup2
THING ON THAT POINT.

01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:57.091 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:58.659 region:rollup2
RECENTLY RELEASED STUDY OR AT

01:49:57.091 --> 01:49:59.726 region:rollup2
LEAST A WORKING PAPER. WHICH I

01:49:58.659 --> 01:50:01.061 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WAS LOOKING AT WATER

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:02.596 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:03.964 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND EFFORTS TO

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:06.633 region:rollup2
PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION AND

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:08.268 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS ONE OF THE FINDINGS

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:09.503 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE. ADJUSTED WHO NOT

01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:11.338 region:rollup2
ONLY TO THOSE EFFORTS SHORT OF.

01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:12.906 region:rollup2
AFFECT WATER CONSERVATION

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:14.408 region:rollup2
PROMOTE CONSERVATION WATER AND

01:50:12.906 --> 01:50:16.243 region:rollup2
ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH LEADING

01:50:14.408 --> 01:50:18.178 region:rollup2
ARE MOVING THAT WATER. BUT ALSO

01:50:16.243 --> 01:50:19.446 region:rollup2
IT HAD TREATING IT LATER RIGHT

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:21.348 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO HAD THE.

01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:22.950 region:rollup2
AFFECT OF AFFECTING PEOPLE'S

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:23.951 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR JUST ON THEIR SHARE

01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:25.219 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY USE.

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:26.353 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE WAS KIND OF AN

01:50:25.219 --> 01:50:27.654 region:rollup2
INTERESTING AND I THINK

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:29.823 region:rollup2
HYPOTHESIS THAT MAYBE JUST OR

01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:30.958 region:rollup2
GREATER ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:32.092 region:rollup2
WATER CONSERVATION COULD ALSO

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:33.794 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME POTENTIAL SPILLOVER

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:35.829 region:rollup2
EFFECTS ON. OTHER TYPES OF

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:37.397 region:rollup2
ENERGY USE ON HAPPY TO. TRY AND

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:38.632 region:rollup2
FIND THAT I THINK WORKING PAPER

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:41.735 region:rollup2
IN AND SEND IT TO YOU.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:43.637 region:rollup2
CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED.

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:44.705 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER WHO TO.

01:50:43.637 --> 01:50:45.005 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER

CHAIR FOR.

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:47.374 region:rollup2
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THIS IS

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.043 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:52.246 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO MEET.

01:50:50.043 --> 01:50:54.615 region:rollup2
.

01:50:52.246 --> 01:50:56.216 region:rollup2
CHAIRPERSON HIGH NICHOLS AND.

01:50:54.615 --> 01:50:57.518 region:rollup2
AND ANSWER SOME REALLY POINTED

01:50:56.216 --> 01:51:00.187 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:50:57.518 --> 01:51:01.655 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN. OF ONE OF THE

01:51:00.187 --> 01:51:02.990 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT IT.

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:06.159 region:rollup2
TOOK TWO YEARS FOUR MONTHS AND

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:06.693 region:rollup2
SIX DAYS TO GET SB ONE APPROVED.

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.428 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE TRANSPORTATION

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:09.997 region:rollup2
FUNDING BILL.

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:11.999 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT WAS

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:13.567 region:rollup2
LIKE HERDING CATS TRYING TO GET

01:51:11.999 --> 01:51:16.303 region:rollup2
THIS COMPREHENSIVE.

01:51:13.567 --> 01:51:18.038 region:rollup2
FIX TO TENS OF BILLIONS OF

01:51:16.303 --> 01:51:19.606 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:21.041 region:rollup2
ON THE HIGHWAYS.

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:23.076 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPING

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:24.611 region:rollup2
PLAN IS COMING TO ME IT'S

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:26.480 region:rollup2
COUNTERINTUITIVE WHEN WE START

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:28.215 region:rollup2
TAKING AND REDUCING VEHICLE

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.385 region:rollup2
TRAVELED MILES.

01:51:28.215 --> 01:51:32.719 region:rollup2
WITH CARS WHICH THEN NOW IF WE

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:34.855 region:rollup2
REDUCING THAT WE'RE REDUCING THE

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:36.023 region:rollup2
INPUT OF MONEY INTO THE MAIN

01:51:34.855 --> 01:51:37.558 region:rollup2
THIS OF HIGHWAYS. AND PUTTING

01:51:36.023 --> 01:51:41.662 region:rollup2
MORE RESERVES WHICH IS A

01:51:37.558 --> 01:51:43.197 region:rollup2
LAUDABLE GOAL. BUT WE ACTUALLY.

01:51:41.662 --> 01:51:46.900 region:rollup2
HAD SUCH A HARD TIME TRYING TO

01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:48.202 region:rollup2
EVEN GET A FIGURE IMPLEMENTED.

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:50.037 region:rollup2
FOR DESERVES TO BE PART OF THE

01:51:48.202 --> 01:51:51.772 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION.

01:51:50.037 --> 01:51:53.373 region:rollup2
TO PAY THEIR SHARE SOMEWHAT OF A

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:54.341 region:rollup2
SHARE. OF THEIR IMPACT ON THE

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:56.209 region:rollup2
ROADS.

01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:57.778 region:rollup2
SO.

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:59.413 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE

01:51:57.778 --> 01:52:02.082 region:rollup2
MILES OR THE ROAD USER CHARGE WE

01:51:59.413 --> 01:52:04.785 region:rollup2
EVER IN THE NEAR FUTURE BE.

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:07.554 region:rollup2
ADOPTED BECAUSE OF PUBLIC.

01:52:04.785 --> 01:52:09.790 region:rollup2
ANGST WITH HOW.

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:10.824 region:rollup2
IT'S PERCEIVED AS BIG BROTHER.

01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:12.659 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WORK SO

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:14.094 region:rollup2
HARD TO GET.

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.062 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE ROADS

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:16.697 region:rollup2
FOR THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA

01:52:15.062 --> 01:52:18.665 region:rollup2
WITH THE FREIGHT DYNAMIC AND AND

01:52:16.697 --> 01:52:20.434 region:rollup2
WHAT OT AND THE AND SAFETY AND

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:22.069 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE THINGS IMPACTED BUT

01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:23.437 region:rollup2
HERE. THIS SCOPING PLAN TAKES

01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:25.038 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM IT.

01:52:23.437 --> 01:52:26.473 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT GOING

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:28.909 region:rollup2
FORWARD NUMBER ONE?

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:29.309 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:52:28.909 --> 01:52:30.177 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT.

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:32.479 region:rollup2
.

01:52:30.177 --> 01:52:33.313 region:rollup2
.

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:35.282 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOLUTIONS HOW DO WE GET

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:35.616 region:rollup2
TO YES RIGHT.

01:52:35.282 --> 01:52:37.150 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BE.

01:52:35.616 --> 01:52:39.319 region:rollup2
.

01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:41.221 region:rollup2
CONSCIOUS OFATTAINMENT OF OF OF

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:43.223 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY'S GOALS.

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:44.524 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.726 region:rollup2
THEN AGAIN WE HAVE A PROGRAM

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:47.995 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY DIMINISHES ANOTHER

01:52:45.726 --> 01:52:49.563 region:rollup2
AGENCIES GOALS.

01:52:47.995 --> 01:52:51.198 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:52:49.563 --> 01:52:51.465 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID.

01:52:51.198 --> 01:52:53.166 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:52:51.465 --> 01:52:55.102 region:rollup2
.

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:56.970 region:rollup2
I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT THERE CAN

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:59.940 region:rollup2
BE SOME KIND OF DISCUSSION.

01:52:56.970 --> 01:53:02.009 region:rollup2
ON AND AND I KNEW I HAD A REALLY

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.509 region:rollup2
GOOD AUTHORISATION WITH RICHARD

01:53:02.009 --> 01:53:05.579 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU'RE NEAR EXACT

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:07.280 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR. ABOUT PARTNERING.

01:53:05.579 --> 01:53:08.715 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.417 region:rollup2
CALTRANS IN THE PORTS ABOUT

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:11.351 region:rollup2
MINIMIZING CONGESTION OUT OF THE

01:53:10.417 --> 01:53:13.353 region:rollup2
PORTS BASED ON.

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:14.755 region:rollup2
.

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:16.657 region:rollup2
IMPACTS TO DISADVANTAGED

01:53:14.755 --> 01:53:20.360 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LIKE WE WE WE

01:53:16.657 --> 01:53:20.861 region:rollup2
REGULATE THE PORT TO THE GATE.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.695 region:rollup2
AND THEN FROM THAT POINT

01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:23.864 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:53:21.695 --> 01:53:25.899 region:rollup2
WE DON'T CARE.

01:53:23.864 --> 01:53:27.634 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:30.737 region:rollup2
BUT THE LARGEST IMPACT ON THE

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:32.706 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IS PASS I GAVE.

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:34.341 region:rollup2
AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT IN THE

01:53:32.706 --> 01:53:35.909 region:rollup2
SCOPING FAMILY WE WOULD ADDRESS

01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:37.544 region:rollup2
THAT IN ITS THEN IT COULD BE TO

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:39.513 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGIC FREE PLAN ALSO.

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:41.581 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP

01:53:39.513 --> 01:53:42.049 region:rollup2
WITH STATE AGENCIES THAT

01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:44.384 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IF WE REDUCE

01:53:42.049 --> 01:53:45.919 region:rollup2
CONGESTION.

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:48.255 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SO MANY BY PRODUCTS OF

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:49.656 region:rollup2
VALUE THAT CAN BE HAD.

01:53:48.255 --> 01:53:52.192 region:rollup2
WERE WE GET MORE THROUGHPUT

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:55.228 region:rollup2
MOBILITY FOR THE ECONOMY.

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:57.164 region:rollup2
WE AT REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:54:00.067 region:rollup2
LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:53:57.164 --> 01:54:02.202 region:rollup2
AND WE ACTUALLY THEN ARE MORE OF

01:54:00.067 --> 01:54:03.370 region:rollup2
VIABLE TWO OTHER SOURCES OF

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:04.671 region:rollup2
SHIPPERS WHO WANT TO COME TO

01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:06.440 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT NOW. WE'RE

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:07.941 region:rollup2
DOING FORTY PERCENT AND.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:10.310 region:rollup2
HE'LL THE STIGMA IS THAT WERE SO

01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:11.511 region:rollup2
OVER REGULATED NOW THAT A LOT OF

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:12.746 region:rollup2
SHIPPERS ARE CONSIDERING BECAUSE

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:14.047 region:rollup2
THEY CAN.

01:54:12.746 --> 01:54:16.516 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE PANAMA CANAL

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:18.251 region:rollup2
EXPANSION GO ELSEWHERE.

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:19.553 region:rollup2
AND DID BEING THAT'S A THIRD OF

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:20.654 region:rollup2
OUR ECONOMY ONE OF OUR LARGEST

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:22.389 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IS WHAT I'M HOPING

01:54:20.654 --> 01:54:26.226 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

01:54:22.389 --> 01:54:26.226 region:rollup2
AS A AS A WHOLE CAN IDENTIFY

01:54:26.293 --> 01:54:28.695 region:rollup2
REAL GOOD WORK AND THOSE REPORTS

01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:29.696 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC ABOUT

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:32.065 region:rollup2
PARTNERING.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:34.067 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE SCOPING PLAN I DON'T

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:36.103 region:rollup2
SEE ANY MENTION. OF.

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:40.140 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:54:36.103 --> 01:54:42.542 region:rollup2
VIABILITY OF OF TAKING.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:44.044 region:rollup2
A LEAD ROLE WITH WITH NOW THAT

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:46.413 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE THIS WITH SP ONE.

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:49.683 region:rollup2
THERE'S MONEY.

01:54:46.413 --> 01:54:52.185 region:rollup2
AND AND AND INCENTIVIZING THAT

01:54:49.683 --> 01:54:54.821 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE LOOK AT ANOTHER VENUE

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:57.190 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT WELL

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:58.692 region:rollup2
AND. I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:54:57.190 --> 01:55:01.361 region:rollup2
YOU'RE POINTING OUT IS THAT NO

01:54:58.692 --> 01:55:02.696 region:rollup2
ONE AGENCY SHOULD OR COULD BE IN

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:04.264 region:rollup2
CONTROL OF ALL OF THE GOOD

01:55:02.696 --> 01:55:06.133 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:08.869 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH AT THE SAME TIME. AND

01:55:06.133 --> 01:55:10.404 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED AT A GOVERNOR AND

01:55:08.869 --> 01:55:13.073 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING

01:55:10.404 --> 01:55:15.809 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO COORDINATE THOSE

01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:17.878 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CALLS AND I SIT AS A

01:55:15.809 --> 01:55:20.547 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SUSTAINABLE

01:55:17.878 --> 01:55:22.582 region:rollup2
FREIGHT. WORKING GROUP I'M I'M

01:55:20.547 --> 01:55:24.951 region:rollup2
JUST ONE MEMBER BUT WE HAVE A

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:26.920 region:rollup2
LOT OF INTERACTION WITH OF STATE

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:29.823 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.525 region:rollup2
CALTRANS AND THE PORTS AROUND

01:55:29.823 --> 01:55:34.194 region:rollup2
THAT EXACT ISSUE.

01:55:31.525 --> 01:55:35.762 region:rollup2
AND TO RIGHT BEFORE THE

01:55:34.194 --> 01:55:37.931 region:rollup2
HOLIDAYS I MET WITH THE.

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:40.333 region:rollup2
SHIPPERS TO TALK ABOUT.

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:43.203 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:45.572 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION GOING FORWARD. UP

01:55:43.203 --> 01:55:48.308 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AROUND HOW THEY CAN

01:55:45.572 --> 01:55:50.310 region:rollup2
GET TO THE KINDS OF INCREASES IN

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:51.978 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND SPEED OF

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:54.181 region:rollup2
THROUGHPUT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:56.383 region:rollup2
FOR WITHOUT JUST BEING.

01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:58.185 region:rollup2
SADDLED WITH MORE REGULATORY

01:55:56.383 --> 01:55:59.252 region:rollup2
BURDENS SO IT'S EXACTLY THE

01:55:58.185 --> 01:56:02.622 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:05.859 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE VERY ARAB COMMITTED

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:10.864 region:rollup2
TO THAT GOAL OF. MAINTAINING AND

01:56:05.859 --> 01:56:17.337 region:rollup2
IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL.

01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:22.542 region:rollup2
ROLE HAS SAID LOGISTICS AT THE

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:26.213 region:rollup2
STATE AND SO. WE TRY TO WORK

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:29.850 region:rollup2
WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES TO MAKE

01:56:26.213 --> 01:56:31.918 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WHATEVER REGULATIONS

01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:35.689 region:rollup2
WERE CONSIDERING OUR PROGRAMS

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:38.592 region:rollup2
ARE CONSIDERING. ARE ALSO A

01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:41.294 region:rollup2
CONGRUENT WITH WHAT THEY'RE

01:56:38.592 --> 01:56:47.334 region:rollup2
THINKING AND.

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:50.537 region:rollup2
AYE WE FOUND CONVERSELY THAT

01:56:47.334 --> 01:56:54.074 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR SISTER AGENCIES

01:56:50.537 --> 01:56:57.611 region:rollup2
WHILE CLIMATE CHANGE MAY NOT BE

01:56:54.074 --> 01:57:01.915 region:rollup2
THEIR BIGGEST AT THEIR THEIR

01:56:57.611 --> 01:57:05.619 region:rollup2
NUMBER ROAD.

01:57:01.915 --> 01:57:07.721 region:rollup2
I OPERATIONS SO I FEEL LIKE HOME

01:57:05.619 --> 01:57:08.622 region:rollup2
AS WE ALL A IS SORT OF LIKE

01:57:07.721 --> 01:57:10.757 region:rollup2
SAYING YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO

01:57:08.622 --> 01:57:11.658 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF WHAT

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:13.827 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING ON EVERYBODY ELSE

01:57:11.658 --> 01:57:15.729 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU. TAKE ACTION BUT IT

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:17.864 region:rollup2
IS TRUE THAT THE SCOPING PLAN IN

01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:21.101 region:rollup2
AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT REFERENCE

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:23.970 region:rollup2
ALL THE OTHER. PLANS THAT IT IT

01:57:21.101 --> 01:57:26.573 region:rollup2
PASSED TO BE COORDINATED WITH

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:27.974 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY

01:57:26.573 --> 01:57:29.776 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO SORT OF.

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:31.912 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT WE HAD

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:33.213 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THAT

01:57:31.912 --> 01:57:34.514 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALL WORKING ON.

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:37.284 region:rollup2
AND IT JUST IF YOU COULD TOUCH

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:40.120 region:rollup2
ON THE OF REDUCTION OF OF.

01:57:37.284 --> 01:57:43.223 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY FUNDING FOR THE

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:45.392 region:rollup2
TRICKS OF THE ROAD. MAIN IS FUN

01:57:43.223 --> 01:57:47.727 region:rollup2
WHICH WITH THROUGH THIS.

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:48.862 region:rollup2
THESE GOALS RIVER COULD YOU

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.763 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUT OF HOW HOW HOW THAT

01:57:48.862 --> 01:57:51.565 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

01:57:49.763 --> 01:57:53.800 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES IS

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:54.134 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY R. OR WILL LEAD TO

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.669 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN.

01:57:54.134 --> 01:57:58.872 region:rollup2
.

01:57:55.669 --> 01:58:00.473 region:rollup2
REVENUE YOU FOR FURTHER OUR

01:57:58.872 --> 01:58:02.375 region:rollup2
ROADS IS THAT AS A.

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:04.911 region:rollup2
A GOOD QUESTION BUT. AT THIS

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:06.246 region:rollup2
POINT WE'RE SO FAR FROM HAVING

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:07.714 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF NUMBERS THAT WOULD

01:58:06.246 --> 01:58:10.250 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE THAT IMPACT THAT

01:58:07.714 --> 01:58:12.085 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO SAY. IT IS TRUE

01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:13.587 region:rollup2
THAT OVER TIME.

01:58:12.085 --> 01:58:16.790 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL.

01:58:13.587 --> 01:58:18.758 region:rollup2
PETROLEUM IS USE IS GONNA GO

01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:21.595 region:rollup2
DOWN AND THAT WILL MEAN THAT

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:23.363 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS TO ACHIEVE REVENUE

01:58:21.595 --> 01:58:25.699 region:rollup2
SERVE AGAIN IN BE NEEDED BUT.

01:58:23.363 --> 01:58:27.634 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T LOOKED THAT FAR INTO

01:58:25.699 --> 01:58:29.169 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH

01:58:27.634 --> 01:58:32.572 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO PLAN

01:58:29.169 --> 01:58:33.907 region:rollup2
FOR. YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY AND

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:38.078 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HEADING TOWARDS

01:58:33.907 --> 01:58:40.146 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTY AND WE AB BASED ON

01:58:38.078 --> 01:58:43.049 region:rollup2
ALL THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN.

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:44.851 region:rollup2
IT EVEN IN TWENTY FIFTY THERE'S

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:50.056 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE VERY LARGE NUMBERS

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:52.659 region:rollup2
OF PETROLEUM CARS. ON THE ROADS

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:54.094 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE.

01:58:52.659 --> 01:58:55.295 region:rollup2
MOON UNIT TOOK TWENTY THREE

01:58:54.094 --> 01:58:57.063 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET AN ADJUSTMENT IN

01:58:55.295 --> 01:58:58.298 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF FIX.

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:59.866 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE LOOK ABOUT TO DO

01:58:58.298 --> 01:59:00.734 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING RETURNS THAT WE WORK

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:02.068 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A DIMINISHING RETURN OF

01:59:00.734 --> 01:59:03.470 region:rollup2
FUNDING WHERE RD SEVENTY NINE

01:59:02.068 --> 01:59:04.304 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOLE.

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:05.839 region:rollup2
WERE ONLY GETTING FIVE POINT TWO

01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:07.273 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND NOT

01:59:05.839 --> 01:59:08.274 region:rollup2
ALL THAT'S GOING TO ROSE WHOSE

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:10.377 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO I WOULD

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:12.679 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WE LOOK AT THAT IN

01:59:10.377 --> 01:59:13.279 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT YOU KNOW.

01:59:12.679 --> 01:59:14.914 region:rollup2
EVEN IF WE HAVE ZERO EMISSION

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:16.082 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THEY NEED TO HAVE

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:17.951 region:rollup2
HIGHWAYS ARE THERE EFFECTIVE IN

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:18.918 region:rollup2
AND SAFE.

01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:19.586 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THEN AGAIN IT'S A

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:22.088 region:rollup2
VERY LAUDABLE GOAL HAVE ELECTRIC

01:59:19.586 --> 01:59:23.089 region:rollup2
TRUCKS.

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:24.991 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING IN

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
CONGESTION NOT MOVING.

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:28.561 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY'RE A LOT MORE

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:30.230 region:rollup2
MONEY AND. WHY WOULD SO MANY BY

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:31.965 region:rollup2
IT IF THEY'RE JUST SITTING

01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:33.133 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THAT COURT?

01:59:31.965 --> 01:59:34.501 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:36.436 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESSING AND

01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:40.073 region:rollup2
CONTINUE. THROUGH THIS PROCESS

01:59:36.436 --> 01:59:41.007 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR AND AGAIN WHAT LOVE

01:59:40.073 --> 01:59:42.142 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE WHAT YOU'VE

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:43.643 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHED AND I APPRECIATE

01:59:42.142 --> 01:59:45.211 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING. BUT I THINK THERE'S

01:59:43.643 --> 01:59:46.713 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS TO

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:48.148 region:rollup2
BE CLEAN AND AND TAKEN IN

01:59:46.713 --> 01:59:49.716 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION.

01:59:48.148 --> 01:59:51.184 region:rollup2
GOINGFORWARD AND.

01:59:49.716 --> 01:59:53.853 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I KEEP HARPING ON THAT

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:55.889 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I SEE. THAT WE GETS IN

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:58.124 region:rollup2
SILOS AND WE AND WE LOOK CERTAIN

01:59:55.889 --> 01:59:59.392 region:rollup2
ASPECTS.

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:00.694 region:rollup2
BUT NOT IN ANY GIVEN I I

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:02.595 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:00:00.694 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
JUSTICE COMMITTEE A COMPONENT OF

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:06.499 region:rollup2
THIS I DON'T SEE.

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:07.534 region:rollup2
A BUSINESS DYNAMIC IN THIS OTHER

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:09.302 region:rollup2
THAN THE MARKET ANALYSIS

02:00:07.534 --> 02:00:10.937 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:11.905 region:rollup2
A I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FAIR AND

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:13.940 region:rollup2
BALANCED.

02:00:11.905 --> 02:00:15.341 region:rollup2
IN.

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:17.243 region:rollup2
IN THE SCOPING PLANS IN AND AND

02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:19.546 region:rollup2
AND IMPLEMENTATION.

02:00:17.243 --> 02:00:22.082 region:rollup2
OF GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW I MEAN

02:00:19.546 --> 02:00:24.050 region:rollup2
I HAVE THREE DELTA.

02:00:22.082 --> 02:00:24.751 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS ADULTS ARE SEWER

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:26.319 region:rollup2
SHIP COULD COUNSEL THOUGH

02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:27.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T CONSERVANCY IN

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:29.956 region:rollup2
THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION.

02:00:27.821 --> 02:00:32.158 region:rollup2
HANDS ALL BASED AROUND THIS

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:34.427 region:rollup2
TWIN TOTAL ASPECT RIGHT.

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:36.429 region:rollup2
BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE LITTLE

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:37.330 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:38.298 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE THIS HUGE DYNAMIC

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:40.033 region:rollup2
OF MORE THE SIXTH LARGEST

02:00:38.298 --> 02:00:41.468 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

02:00:40.033 --> 02:00:43.103 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THE BUSINESS

02:00:41.468 --> 02:00:44.170 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HAS TO BE EMBRACED AT

02:00:43.103 --> 02:00:46.072 region:rollup2
SOME POINT. NOT AT SOME POINT

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:48.341 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:51.578 region:rollup2
UGH THAT IT IS IS A KEY DYNAMIC

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:54.147 region:rollup2
FIGURE AND. EMPLOYED FOR THE

02:00:51.578 --> 02:00:55.048 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLANS AND IT IS IN NOT

02:00:54.147 --> 02:00:57.283 region:rollup2
SO I JUST RECEIVED A ONE YEAR

02:00:55.048 --> 02:00:58.518 region:rollup2
AND OUT THE OTHER. THAT ACTUALLY

02:00:57.283 --> 02:00:59.085 region:rollup2
INCLUDE IS IS.

02:00:58.518 --> 02:01:00.086 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EXPERTS

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:01.955 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:03.523 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU GUYS ARE.

02:01:01.955 --> 02:01:04.557 region:rollup2
THEY DO IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN

02:01:03.523 --> 02:01:07.227 region:rollup2
A I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD.

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:08.895 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THIS EXPORTED ADVICE AND

02:01:07.227 --> 02:01:10.597 region:rollup2
INPUT.

02:01:08.895 --> 02:01:11.564 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO COUNTER BALANCE

02:01:10.597 --> 02:01:13.566 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE'VE HAD THIS

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:14.167 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WHERE.

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:16.770 region:rollup2
ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY WE

02:01:14.167 --> 02:01:19.172 region:rollup2
CAN GET HERE OVERNIGHT.

02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:21.207 region:rollup2
A GLIDE PATH BACK TO SUCCESS.

02:01:19.172 --> 02:01:22.142 region:rollup2
IN MY MY WORLD.

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:24.310 region:rollup2
WHEN IT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE

02:01:22.142 --> 02:01:27.247 region:rollup2
ECONOMY OR AND AND AND THE

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:29.015 region:rollup2
CONSUMER'S WALLET. IS IS A GREAT

02:01:27.247 --> 02:01:29.582 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO AFTER THOSE YOU KNOW

02:01:29.015 --> 02:01:29.849 region:rollup2
AND SO I HAVE JUST ONE MORE

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:32.118 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:33.153 region:rollup2
.

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:34.687 region:rollup2
IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED

02:01:33.153 --> 02:01:36.823 region:rollup2
IN MISTER STEARNS QUESTION ABOUT

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:39.793 region:rollup2
THE WILDFIRES.

02:01:36.823 --> 02:01:41.127 region:rollup2
REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE

02:01:39.793 --> 02:01:42.128 region:rollup2
GOOD WORK THAT YOU DO DURING THE

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:44.063 region:rollup2
YEAR WITH EURASIA SANTA AND THE

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:46.533 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEN WE HAVE

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:48.835 region:rollup2
THESE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES.

02:01:46.533 --> 02:01:52.005 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ZERO ZERO OUT. WHAT

02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:54.807 region:rollup2
YOU'VE DONE ANY YEAR?

02:01:52.005 --> 02:01:56.376 region:rollup2
IZZARD ABILITY FOR.

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:58.111 region:rollup2
YOUR AGENCY AND COLLABORATION OR

02:01:56.376 --> 02:01:59.412 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE AND OTHER AGENCIES.

02:01:58.111 --> 02:02:00.980 region:rollup2
TO MITIGATE.

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:02.515 region:rollup2
.

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.616 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:05.418 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:07.854 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

02:02:05.418 --> 02:02:09.923 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE USED TO HAVE

02:02:07.854 --> 02:02:11.157 region:rollup2
GRAZING ON STATE LANDS.

02:02:09.923 --> 02:02:12.592 region:rollup2
WE DON'T ANYMORE AND I'M WHAT

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:14.394 region:rollup2
I'M HEARING FROM IS THE FUELS

02:02:12.592 --> 02:02:15.161 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING LARGER AND GETTING

02:02:14.394 --> 02:02:16.663 region:rollup2
UP INTO THE CANOPY IS BECAUSE OF

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:19.632 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:02:16.663 --> 02:02:21.201 region:rollup2
AND ANY LOOK AT MAYBE. FASTER

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.868 region:rollup2
RESPONSES OR WHATEVER IT WATER

02:02:21.201 --> 02:02:24.370 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:25.672 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:02:24.370 --> 02:02:27.373 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY STEP WE TAKE FOR WE

02:02:25.672 --> 02:02:29.309 region:rollup2
TAKE TWO STEPS BACK IF THERE'S A

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:30.910 region:rollup2
NATIONAL DISASTER LIKE THIS.

02:02:29.309 --> 02:02:32.645 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE GAINED IF WE

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.146 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND I'M

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:35.114 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT YOU GUYS CAN

02:02:33.146 --> 02:02:36.983 region:rollup2

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:39.485 region:rollup2
THAT COUPLE AND AGAIN ACT OF GOD

02:02:36.983 --> 02:02:40.987 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS I UNDERSTAND. BUT

CAN WE BE A PART OF THAT.

02:02:40.987 --> 02:02:44.958 region:rollup2
EQUATION.

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:46.759 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DO.

02:02:44.958 --> 02:02:49.729 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN VALUE.

02:02:46.759 --> 02:02:51.497 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS DO.

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:53.800 region:rollup2

I'VE I I INDICATED WE ARE.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.670 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:59.572 region:rollup2
AGENCY NATURISTS US AGENCY AND

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:01.574 region:rollup2
OUT CALLIE PA AND THE

02:02:59.572 --> 02:03:02.642 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT DEPARTMENTS SAT OVER

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:06.579 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

02:03:02.642 --> 02:03:09.115 region:rollup2
ON THIS ARE APPROACH TO MANAGING

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:11.184 region:rollup2
OUR FORESTS FOR HEALTH AT WHICH

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:13.386 region:rollup2
INCLUDES BEING ABLE TO STORE

02:03:11.184 --> 02:03:15.421 region:rollup2
CARBON. OTHER NATURAL AND

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:17.523 region:rollup2
WORKING LANDS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:20.059 region:rollup2
RANGELANDS.

02:03:17.523 --> 02:03:20.860 region:rollup2
WETLANDS AT RIGHT PARIAN AREAS

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:23.229 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOT.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.999 region:rollup2
EVEN OUR STATE PARKS.

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:27.267 region:rollup2
HAVE IN SOME INSTANCES GOT

02:03:25.999 --> 02:03:29.435 region:rollup2
DEGRADED.

02:03:27.267 --> 02:03:31.137 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY REALLY

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:32.272 region:rollup2
AREN'T ABLE TO STORE IS MUCH

02:03:31.137 --> 02:03:34.741 region:rollup2
CARBON AS THEY.

02:03:32.272 --> 02:03:36.376 region:rollup2
AS THEY SHOULD AND SO.

02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:39.112 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE

02:03:36.376 --> 02:03:40.747 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE

02:03:39.112 --> 02:03:41.714 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT'S ALREADY ONGOING

02:03:40.747 --> 02:03:43.917 region:rollup2
AND THE STRESSES THAT THESE

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:45.718 region:rollup2
PLACES ALREADY ARE ACHIEVING. TO

02:03:43.917 --> 02:03:47.086 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:49.255 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:52.025 region:rollup2
TO HELP MAKE THEM HEALTHIER

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:53.426 region:rollup2
THAN THEY ARE AND OBVIOUSLY A RB

02:03:52.025 --> 02:03:56.429 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE THAT.

02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:58.064 region:rollup2
THE WISDOM TO KNOW ALL OF IT

02:03:56.429 --> 02:03:59.766 region:rollup2
ALL THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST AT. IN

02:03:58.064 --> 02:04:01.100 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND INVESTED

02:03:59.766 --> 02:04:03.202 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF BRINGING OUT SOME

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.971 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:06.439 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE AND AND.

02:04:04.971 --> 02:04:08.641 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE ISSUES BUT.

02:04:06.439 --> 02:04:10.777 region:rollup2
THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:11.311 region:rollup2
PARTNERING WITH THESE WITH THESE

02:04:10.777 --> 02:04:14.814 region:rollup2
OTHER AGENCIES APPRECIATE

02:04:11.311 --> 02:04:16.849 region:rollup2
MAKING.

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:19.419 region:rollup2
THINKING IS A FACIAL.

02:04:16.849 --> 02:04:21.721 region:rollup2
MISLIM ON.

BECAUSE I WANTED TO INQUIRE A

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.694 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:30.163 region:rollup2
.

02:04:27.694 --> 02:04:31.331 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF I KNOW THAT UNDER

02:04:30.163 --> 02:04:32.865 region:rollup2
KIND OF SHORT LIVED CLIENTS WE

02:04:31.331 --> 02:04:34.767 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE BLACK CARBON AND

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:36.669 region:rollup2
AND.

02:04:34.767 --> 02:04:39.005 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING A DISTRICT THAT HAS

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:41.474 region:rollup2
JUST HAD THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN

02:04:39.005 --> 02:04:44.043 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S HISTORY. AND WHO

02:04:41.474 --> 02:04:46.045 region:rollup2
SPENT A MONTH OF WEARING MASKS

02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:48.314 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT IN PARTS OF MY

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:50.850 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. THE AIR QUALITY GOT TO

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:52.251 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS NOXIOUS BAD THAT

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:54.554 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS.

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:55.154 region:rollup2
AND HOW YOU KNOW ON DECEMBER

02:04:54.554 --> 02:04:56.522 region:rollup2
NINTH OUR GOVERNOR SAID. THIS

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:58.324 region:rollup2
IS.

02:04:56.522 --> 02:05:00.727 region:rollup2
NOW THE NORM.

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:02.028 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S TALKING ABOUT.

02:05:00.727 --> 02:05:04.130 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NO

02:05:02.028 --> 02:05:05.631 region:rollup2
LONGER STAFF ON A TEMPORARY

02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:07.567 region:rollup2
BASIS AND WILL HAVE TO STAFF ON

02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:10.436 region:rollup2
A TWELVE MONTH BASIS.

02:05:07.567 --> 02:05:14.474 region:rollup2
SO KNOWING ALL OF THIS.

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:16.142 region:rollup2
IS THERE ARE ABILITY TO RETHINK.

02:05:14.474 --> 02:05:17.777 region:rollup2
ALL TOGETHER THE MEASUREMENT

02:05:16.142 --> 02:05:19.412 region:rollup2
ASPECT NOT JUST WHAT WE DO TO

02:05:17.777 --> 02:05:21.581 region:rollup2
CAPTURE CARBON RIGHT BUT ALSO

02:05:19.412 --> 02:05:24.283 region:rollup2
THE HOW WE MEASURE.

02:05:21.581 --> 02:05:26.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I IT'S A NEW REALITY FOR

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:27.453 region:rollup2
S. I WISH IT WASN'T SO. I WISH

02:05:26.085 --> 02:05:29.489 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:32.892 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE'RE NO LONGER TALKING

02:05:29.489 --> 02:05:35.695 region:rollup2
ABOUT SHORT LIVED WHAT KIND OF.

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:37.030 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE DO WE NEED TO THINK

02:05:35.695 --> 02:05:37.430 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE

02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:38.831 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT ASPECT

02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:40.066 region:rollup2
DEBATE.

02:05:38.831 --> 02:05:41.501 region:rollup2
MANY THINK IT YOU KNOW AGAIN

02:05:40.066 --> 02:05:43.970 region:rollup2
THIS IS

02:05:41.501 --> 02:05:45.505 region:rollup2
IT VERY NEAR IN DEEP THE FIRE

02:05:43.970 --> 02:05:47.273 region:rollup2
STILL BURNING IN MY DISTRICT.

02:05:45.505 --> 02:05:47.473 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT OUT YET.

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:49.876 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:05:47.473 --> 02:05:51.310 region:rollup2
.

02:05:49.876 --> 02:05:52.545 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW DOES THE PUBLIC

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:53.813 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THIS.

02:05:52.545 --> 02:05:55.314 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK YOU ALREADY GIVEN A

02:05:53.813 --> 02:05:58.317 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOUGHT TO THE ISSUE I'M

02:05:55.314 --> 02:06:00.586 region:rollup2
NOT SURE EIGHT. HOW DO I RESPOND

02:05:58.317 --> 02:06:02.822 region:rollup2
EXCEPT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL WITH

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:05.191 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE EXPOSURES THAT

02:06:02.822 --> 02:06:07.427 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING? ARM

02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:10.797 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS

02:06:07.427 --> 02:06:12.832 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS. IN MEASURING

02:06:10.797 --> 02:06:14.867 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:06:12.832 --> 02:06:16.836 region:rollup2
STICKING A MONITOR OUT SOMEWHERE

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:19.639 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT WHAT THAT HAPPENS

02:06:16.836 --> 02:06:21.941 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE. SO WE HAVE THE

02:06:19.639 --> 02:06:24.010 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO AND.

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:26.779 region:rollup2
TO DEPLOY.

02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:27.947 region:rollup2
BACKPACK SIZE MONITORS THAT YOU

02:06:26.779 --> 02:06:30.550 region:rollup2
COULD.

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:32.552 region:rollup2
UTILIZED TO GET A BETTER SENSE

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:34.053 region:rollup2
OF THE LONGER TERM HEALTH

02:06:32.552 --> 02:06:35.388 region:rollup2
EFFECTS AND THE SHORT TERM

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:37.757 region:rollup2
AFFECTS OF.

02:06:35.388 --> 02:06:39.625 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A

02:06:37.757 --> 02:06:41.994 region:rollup2
FIRE THAT THAT NOT THAT THEY

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:44.097 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY FIRST

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:45.965 region:rollup2
OF ALL NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE

02:06:44.097 --> 02:06:47.867 region:rollup2
DANGER BUT THEN WHEN THEY COME

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:49.936 region:rollup2
BACK AGAIN INTO COMMUNITIES

02:06:47.867 --> 02:06:52.004 region:rollup2
WHERE THE FIRES ARE? YOU KNOW

02:06:49.936 --> 02:06:54.874 region:rollup2
NOT RIGHT NEXT TO THEM THE AIR

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:57.410 region:rollup2
QUALITY CAN STILL BE VERY BAD.

02:06:54.874 --> 02:07:00.313 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:06:57.410 --> 02:07:02.148 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT NOT ONLY MEASURING

02:07:00.313 --> 02:07:05.384 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING BUT

02:07:02.148 --> 02:07:07.820 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS TO. PROTECT

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:11.123 region:rollup2
THEM BETTER IN THOSE SITUATIONS

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:14.393 region:rollup2
FROM THE IMPACTS OF OF WHAT

02:07:11.123 --> 02:07:18.131 region:rollup2
THEIR BREATHING AND WE'RE NOT

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:20.666 region:rollup2
REALLY AT AT THIS POINT. THING

02:07:18.131 --> 02:07:22.768 region:rollup2
GEARED UP TO DO THAT VERY

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:26.239 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY I THINK WE'VE WORKED

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:28.841 region:rollup2
WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICTS TO. GET

02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:31.377 region:rollup2
TIMELY INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:35.882 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THE AIR QUALITY IN

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:39.619 region:rollup2
THEIR AREA IS LIKE AND TO MAKE

02:07:35.882 --> 02:07:45.258 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO.

02:07:39.619 --> 02:07:50.730 region:rollup2
AVOID. BREATHING TOO MUCH OF IT

02:07:45.258 --> 02:07:52.965 region:rollup2
BUT IT OUT IT'S STILL IS NOT A.

02:07:50.730 --> 02:08:01.274 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A SITUATION THAT I

02:07:52.965 --> 02:08:03.009 region:rollup2
THINK IS IDEAL THE.

02:08:01.274 --> 02:08:05.211 region:rollup2
THE MESSAGE AND I KNOW THAT.

02:08:03.009 --> 02:08:07.413 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THEIR.

02:08:05.211 --> 02:08:10.783 region:rollup2
NATURAL RESOURCES FIELD AND IT.

02:08:07.413 --> 02:08:12.251 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE FOR YEARS HAVE TRIED

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.853 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH LOCAL LAND USE

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:15.454 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO.

02:08:13.853 --> 02:08:18.291 region:rollup2
AT.

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:20.326 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ADD

02:08:18.291 --> 02:08:21.827 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL ABOUT

02:08:20.326 --> 02:08:24.697 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE EDGE OF THE

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:27.433 region:rollup2
FOREST AND THE NEED TO HAVE

02:08:24.697 --> 02:08:29.936 region:rollup2
CLEARED AREAS AROUND WHERE

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:32.338 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE LIVING AND NOT. TO

02:08:29.936 --> 02:08:34.640 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO.

02:08:32.338 --> 02:08:35.841 region:rollup2
JUST YOU KNOW. HAVE.

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:39.345 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT KIND OF IN THE

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:41.447 region:rollup2
MIDST OF A FORESTED AREAS WHERE

02:08:39.345 --> 02:08:43.482 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T REALLY EFFECTIVE IS

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:47.853 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT FIRES ONCE

02:08:43.482 --> 02:08:49.422 region:rollup2
THEY START. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:52.024 region:rollup2
GONNA BE AN AREA THAT THEY WOULD

02:08:49.422 --> 02:08:52.825 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE MORE ATTENTION PAID

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:54.627 region:rollup2
I KNOW.

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:57.063 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

02:08:54.627 --> 02:08:59.365 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR THAT TYPE OF

02:08:57.063 --> 02:09:01.234 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:08:59.365 --> 02:09:02.602 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITHIN.

02:09:01.234 --> 02:09:05.972 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

02:09:02.602 --> 02:09:06.906 region:rollup2
COUNCIL AND ELSEWHERE ITEM AT I

02:09:05.972 --> 02:09:08.674 region:rollup2
MEAN I THINK WE JUST ALL AS A

02:09:06.906 --> 02:09:10.243 region:rollup2
STATE ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE MUCH

02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:11.777 region:rollup2
MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE RISK.

02:09:10.243 --> 02:09:14.814 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE BEEN A FAR.

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:16.282 region:rollup2
THIS BURKE.

02:09:14.814 --> 02:09:18.284 region:rollup2
I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.

02:09:16.282 --> 02:09:20.419 region:rollup2
A WAS BACK TO US CENTER

02:09:18.284 --> 02:09:21.320 region:rollup2
SKINNER'S QUESTION WHICH

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.855 region:rollup2
SO TRIED AND IT'S BACK TO BEING

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:24.390 region:rollup2
THE BANKING.

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:26.993 region:rollup2
SO TRADITIONALLY WE'VE WE'VE

02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:28.928 region:rollup2
BEEN EARLY TO MEET OUR GOALS BUT

02:09:26.993 --> 02:09:30.763 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WITH

02:09:28.928 --> 02:09:31.964 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT AND PERCENT RANGE

02:09:30.763 --> 02:09:33.099 region:rollup2
OF OF ARTICLES BEING MET BY CAP

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:35.635 region:rollup2
AND TRADE.

02:09:33.099 --> 02:09:36.702 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:35.635 --> 02:09:39.438 region:rollup2
I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:40.039 region:rollup2
MUCH OF BANKING OF THE BANKING

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:40.606 region:rollup2
OF OF CREDITS IS REALLY GOING

02:09:40.039 --> 02:09:42.675 region:rollup2
TO.

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:44.844 region:rollup2
.

02:09:42.675 --> 02:09:47.346 region:rollup2
BE IN ISSUE AND HOW FAR IN

02:09:44.844 --> 02:09:48.648 region:rollup2
ADVANCE WE WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:49.915 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE LEGISLATIVELY BECAUSE

02:09:48.648 --> 02:09:51.384 region:rollup2
YOU SAID IT'S A POLICY ISSUE.

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:53.719 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING HOW FAR IN ADVANCE

02:09:51.384 --> 02:09:55.054 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY THIRTY WE WOULD HAVE

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:57.256 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INFORMATION OR ENOUGH

02:09:55.054 --> 02:10:00.259 region:rollup2
DATA. TO KNOW WHEN WE WOULD HAVE

02:09:57.256 --> 02:10:01.527 region:rollup2
TO AFFECT THAT POLICY.

02:10:00.259 --> 02:10:03.596 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I DON'T

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:06.432 region:rollup2
HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER FOR YOU I

02:10:03.596 --> 02:10:09.068 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO BE. LOOKING AT

02:10:06.432 --> 02:10:11.671 region:rollup2
THE ALBUM DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM

02:10:09.068 --> 02:10:13.839 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD. MIA AS WE MOVE IT

02:10:11.671 --> 02:10:17.009 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND TO

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:18.744 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME MEASURES OF FOR.

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:20.479 region:rollup2
TAKING STOCK OF WHERE THAT

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:22.815 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES ARE AND WHAT'S

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:25.384 region:rollup2
HAPPENING WITH THEM. TO HAVE A

02:10:22.815 --> 02:10:27.286 region:rollup2
BETTER PICTURE OF IT. BUT I DO

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:29.555 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:31.057 region:rollup2
TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES THAT

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:32.191 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS IT

02:10:31.057 --> 02:10:34.527 region:rollup2
IS SORT OF LIKE.

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:36.529 region:rollup2
TRADING IN DERIVATIVES IT'S

02:10:34.527 --> 02:10:38.998 region:rollup2
TRADING ENOUGH AN INSTRUMENT IF

02:10:36.529 --> 02:10:39.865 region:rollup2
NOT TRADING IN A REAL PHAGOCYTE

02:10:38.998 --> 02:10:41.967 region:rollup2
IT OUT IT AT ALL VIOLENCE

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:44.003 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS AN ABILITY TO IN THAT

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:46.072 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THE ACTUAL

02:10:44.003 --> 02:10:47.506 region:rollup2
EMISSION. AND SO IF YOU'RE

02:10:46.072 --> 02:10:49.975 region:rollup2
TRACKING WHERE THE EMISSIONS ARE

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:52.511 region:rollup2
COMING FROM WHICH WE CAN DO

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:54.580 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE REPORTED DATA.

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:56.582 region:rollup2
THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THERE'S

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:58.851 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF SOURCE WHERE YOU'RE

02:10:56.582 --> 02:11:00.986 region:rollup2
GETTING INCREASES IN ACTUAL

02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:03.389 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND PEOPLE USING

02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:04.957 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES TO COMPLY. AND THEN

02:11:03.389 --> 02:11:08.461 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:10.796 region:rollup2
SENSE OF WHERE YOU NEEDED TO GO

02:11:08.461 --> 02:11:14.400 region:rollup2
WITH A MORE TARGETED. APPROACH

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:17.970 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WITH THE ANNUAL.

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:22.308 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND.

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:24.877 region:rollup2
REVEALING THAT WE'RE DOING THAT

02:11:22.308 --> 02:11:28.047 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE

02:11:24.877 --> 02:11:31.617 region:rollup2
KINDS OF TRENDS HAPPENING OBEY

02:11:28.047 --> 02:11:34.453 region:rollup2
SO FAR THE GOOD NEWS IS SPEND

02:11:31.617 --> 02:11:39.125 region:rollup2
THAT ON THAT. EITHER ELECTRICITY

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:41.427 region:rollup2
SIDE WE'VE SEEN OUR REDUCTIONS

02:11:39.125 --> 02:11:43.362 region:rollup2
HAPPENING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT

02:11:41.427 --> 02:11:47.099 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GONNA HAPPEN THAT'S

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:48.868 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE RIGHT IS YOU

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:51.036 region:rollup2
KNOW THE CULMINATION OF PRICING

02:11:48.868 --> 02:11:53.839 region:rollup2
ON THE REGULATIONS.

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:56.776 region:rollup2
MOVING PEOPLE IN THE DIRECTION

02:11:53.839 --> 02:11:59.812 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE ALL WANTED TO GO

02:11:56.776 --> 02:12:02.081 region:rollup2
BUT DOING IT EVEN FASTER BECAUSE

02:11:59.812 --> 02:12:03.916 region:rollup2
THE PRICES START TO COME DOWN

02:12:02.081 --> 02:12:04.550 region:rollup2
FOR THE TECHNOLOGY.

02:12:03.916 --> 02:12:11.924 region:rollup2
THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT HAPPENED

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:13.926 region:rollup2
DID AND UP IN THE PLAY.

02:12:11.924 --> 02:12:16.462 region:rollup2
AND THE PROCESS THAT WE CAN

02:12:13.926 --> 02:12:18.197 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKE MOVING FORWARD. AS A

02:12:16.462 --> 02:12:19.865 region:rollup2
RACE TO ADDITIONAL DIRECT

02:12:18.197 --> 02:12:22.501 region:rollup2
MEASURE. REDUCTIONS.

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:23.702 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AND I ASK

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:26.772 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO QUESTIONS IN THE

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:28.741 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF. THE DEFINING OF THE

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:29.475 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

02:12:28.741 --> 02:12:31.010 region:rollup2
AS A DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION

02:12:29.475 --> 02:12:32.278 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:34.380 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:36.248 region:rollup2
LOVE QUESTIONS AND.

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.749 region:rollup2
.

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:38.551 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOME

02:12:36.749 --> 02:12:41.353 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION ON THAT. AS IT

02:12:38.551 --> 02:12:43.923 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THE CONFLICT THAT IT.

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:45.524 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE ARE PRESENTING OR

02:12:43.923 --> 02:12:47.159 region:rollup2
HOW IT'S BEING INTERPRETED

02:12:45.524 --> 02:12:49.061 region:rollup2
RELATED TO AB ONE NINETY SEVEN

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:50.896 region:rollup2
IT'S DIRECTED MISSION REDUCTION

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:53.466 region:rollup2
MEASURES. IN PLACE.

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:56.669 region:rollup2
THIS IS A I KNOW A DEFINITIONAL

02:12:53.466 --> 02:12:59.939 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND AYE I AM DON'T WANNA

02:12:56.669 --> 02:13:01.340 region:rollup2
BE AND.

02:12:59.939 --> 02:13:02.741 region:rollup2
NO ONE IS I DON'T TRY TO BRUSH

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.243 region:rollup2
IT OVER AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:06.245 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE.

02:13:04.243 --> 02:13:08.848 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THE FACT THAT THE.

02:13:06.245 --> 02:13:12.384 region:rollup2
.

02:13:08.848 --> 02:13:14.653 region:rollup2
DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:17.690 region:rollup2
OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS FOR

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:19.992 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE A PROGRAM THAT PAYS

02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:20.559 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO TURN IN AN OLD CAR AND

02:13:19.992 --> 02:13:22.328 region:rollup2
GIVES THE MONEY TO BUY A NEW

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:24.363 region:rollup2
CAR.

02:13:22.328 --> 02:13:27.032 region:rollup2
IS STILL A DIRECT EMISSION THE

02:13:24.363 --> 02:13:28.434 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN THE SENSE THAT AN

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:30.636 region:rollup2
OLD CAR IS BEING SCRAPPED AND A

02:13:28.434 --> 02:13:33.739 region:rollup2
NEW CAR IS GOING ON TO THE ROAD

02:13:30.636 --> 02:13:34.907 region:rollup2
SO. REAL EMISSIONS ARE ARE BEING

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:37.643 region:rollup2
REDUCED.

02:13:34.907 --> 02:13:40.980 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR MARKET BASED

02:13:37.643 --> 02:13:43.015 region:rollup2
MEASURES GET DIRECT EMISSIONS

02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:46.485 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS OUR EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:13:43.015 --> 02:13:48.487 region:rollup2
UTILIZE A DIFFERENT WAY OF.

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:50.055 region:rollup2
GETTING THERE AND I THINK THAT'S

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:50.656 region:rollup2
MAYBE BEEN A PROBLEM OF

02:13:50.055 --> 02:13:54.026 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY AS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:13:50.656 --> 02:13:55.794 region:rollup2
IN.

02:13:54.026 --> 02:14:00.132 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:13:55.794 --> 02:14:02.001 region:rollup2
THE DESIRE OF THAT I NO I.

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:04.637 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE FELT

02:14:02.001 --> 02:14:07.239 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MORE MEASURES THAT

02:14:04.637 --> 02:14:09.241 region:rollup2
TARGETED AN INDIVIDUAL SOURCE

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:10.643 region:rollup2
SOURCE BY SOURCE AND SAID THOU

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:13.812 region:rollup2
SHALT NOT EMIT MORE THAN EXT

02:14:10.643 --> 02:14:15.347 region:rollup2
AMOUNT AND IF YOU DO. IT OUT BAD

02:14:13.812 --> 02:14:16.849 region:rollup2
THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.

02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:19.685 region:rollup2
.

02:14:16.849 --> 02:14:21.887 region:rollup2
OUR ANALYSIS IN THE SCOPING PLAY

02:14:19.685 --> 02:14:23.222 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE LOOKED AT BOTH

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:25.724 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY OF ACHIEVING THE

02:14:23.222 --> 02:14:27.693 region:rollup2
OVERALL GOALS AND THE COST OF

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:29.862 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THE OVERALL GOALS. WAS

02:14:27.693 --> 02:14:32.298 region:rollup2
THAT YOU REALLY NEEDED A MIX OF

02:14:29.862 --> 02:14:34.233 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEASURES.

02:14:32.298 --> 02:14:34.967 region:rollup2
ALL OF WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON

02:14:34.233 --> 02:14:36.869 region:rollup2
GETTING YOU.

02:14:34.967 --> 02:14:39.405 region:rollup2
.

02:14:36.869 --> 02:14:41.440 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME

02:14:39.405 --> 02:14:43.575 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND THE ONES WHERE

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:46.946 region:rollup2
THE STATE WILL HAVE TO PAY LAST.

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:48.347 region:rollup2
OUT OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND WHERE.

02:14:46.946 --> 02:14:49.648 region:rollup2
YOU COULD MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:14:48.347 --> 02:14:53.118 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS WERE ACTUALLY

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:56.889 region:rollup2
HAPPENING SO. AND WE HAVE

02:14:53.118 --> 02:15:01.193 region:rollup2
HAD A VERY. STRONG CONFIDENCE

02:14:56.889 --> 02:15:03.128 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT WE CAN MONITOR HOW

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:05.297 region:rollup2
MANY ALLOWANCES ARE OUT THERE WE

02:15:03.128 --> 02:15:06.699 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO HAS THEM WE KNOW WHAT

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:08.601 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING WITH THEM AND OUT

02:15:06.699 --> 02:15:09.735 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR. AND WE

02:15:08.601 --> 02:15:12.204 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS

02:15:09.735 --> 02:15:15.174 region:rollup2
OF THE FACILITIES ARE AND SO WE

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:17.476 region:rollup2
CAN USE THOSE TO DRIVE DOWN. THE

02:15:15.174 --> 02:15:19.545 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FROM THOSE INDIVIDUAL

02:15:17.476 --> 02:15:22.348 region:rollup2
SOURCES FACILITIES THAT ARE

02:15:19.545 --> 02:15:25.684 region:rollup2
UNDER UNDER THE PROGRAM.

02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:27.453 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE TRIED TO COMPARE.

02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:29.188 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BY PROGRAM OR STRATEGY

02:15:27.453 --> 02:15:30.689 region:rollup2
BY STRATEGY.

02:15:29.188 --> 02:15:33.792 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE WHOLE FIELD OF

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:36.028 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AND TO I'M

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:37.463 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THEM THAT WAY IN

02:15:36.028 --> 02:15:42.001 region:rollup2
COMPARISON.

02:15:37.463 --> 02:15:44.136 region:rollup2
IN COMPARISON WITH EACH OTHER.

02:15:42.001 --> 02:15:46.071 region:rollup2
SO I TRY RAISE THE QUESTION

02:15:44.136 --> 02:15:47.640 region:rollup2
BREAK BECAUSE ENDED DEBATE AND

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:49.041 region:rollup2
DELIBERATION OF A AB ONE NINETY

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:51.010 region:rollup2
SEVEN THERE WAS A LOT OF

02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:53.445 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ASKED IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:55.147 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND THAT IT HAD ON THE

02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:56.081 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE.

02:15:55.147 --> 02:15:56.982 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WAY IN THERE WAS A

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:58.517 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS THAT THAT WOULD WOULD

02:15:56.982 --> 02:16:01.053 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:15:58.517 --> 02:16:02.187 region:rollup2
BE THE FINDER CONSIDERED A AT

02:16:01.053 --> 02:16:04.289 region:rollup2
LEAST A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:09.561 region:rollup2
A DIRECT MISSION.

02:16:04.289 --> 02:16:12.097 region:rollup2
THAT REDUCTION THE TOOLOR FOR

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:13.799 region:rollup2
MY THREE MINUTE RATE THEMSELVES

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:15.334 region:rollup2
UP I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:16:13.799 --> 02:16:16.802 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL LACK OF OF. CAMP

02:16:15.334 --> 02:16:18.537 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS AROUND THAT

02:16:16.802 --> 02:16:22.775 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I WOULD APPRECIATE

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:24.143 region:rollup2
THAT WE CONTINUE TO KIND OF.

02:16:22.775 --> 02:16:25.677 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT.

02:16:24.143 --> 02:16:26.645 region:rollup2
THOSE DISCREPANCIES EXIST HiA

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:27.212 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:30.649 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:16:27.212 --> 02:16:32.251 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS ISSUE OF BUT.

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:33.218 region:rollup2
A DIRECT COMMISSION MEASURE I

02:16:32.251 --> 02:16:34.286 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE ARE.

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:35.087 region:rollup2
.

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:35.721 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY I GROUPS AND

02:16:35.087 --> 02:16:36.755 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE

02:16:35.721 --> 02:16:41.293 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY

02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:41.293 region:rollup2
WHO REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLE LESS.

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:45.597 region:rollup2
THAT JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:48.567 region:rollup2
GOOD WAY TO GO. AND.

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:49.902 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I

02:16:48.567 --> 02:16:51.437 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM

02:16:49.902 --> 02:16:53.739 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE

02:16:51.437 --> 02:16:56.508 region:rollup2
TO CONVINCE ME. BUT HAVING SAID

02:16:53.739 --> 02:16:58.510 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:59.678 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE AND

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:01.980 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY.

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:05.217 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE COMPLYING

02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:07.920 region:rollup2
WITH THE. LETTER AND THE SPIRIT

02:17:05.217 --> 02:17:09.621 region:rollup2
OF ONE NINETY SEVEN I THINK IF

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:10.689 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STILL FEEL

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:11.924 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANTED SOMETHING

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:13.125 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OR SHOULD OF GOTTEN

02:17:11.924 --> 02:17:15.527 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:17:13.125 --> 02:17:18.197 region:rollup2
FROM ONE NINETY SEVEN.

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:21.333 region:rollup2
I I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT I HAD BUT

02:17:18.197 --> 02:17:22.801 region:rollup2
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN ANY

02:17:21.333 --> 02:17:25.904 region:rollup2
DANGER IN TERMS OF OUR.

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:27.739 region:rollup2
LEGAL SITUATION.

02:17:25.904 --> 02:17:29.374 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HANDFUL

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:31.577 region:rollup2
OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL RIGHT

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:32.644 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR INTENTIONS

02:17:31.577 --> 02:17:34.012 region:rollup2
WARY WAS CERTAINLY TIPPED UP

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:36.515 region:rollup2
BRING FORWARD SOME SOME? FORM OF

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:38.250 region:rollup2
RELIEF ON THE CAP AND TRADE

02:17:36.515 --> 02:17:41.019 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND NOT REALLY.

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:42.321 region:rollup2
BANK ON THAT AS THE TOOL AND DIE

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:43.355 region:rollup2
SO THE DIRECT ADMISSION

02:17:42.321 --> 02:17:45.724 region:rollup2
COMPONENT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:46.859 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:47.926 region:rollup2
THEY OUGHT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:17:46.859 --> 02:17:49.328 region:rollup2
AN IS CERTAINLY.

02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:49.862 region:rollup2
NOT ONE WHERE YOU KNOW WE'LL GO

02:17:49.328 --> 02:17:51.630 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO

02:17:49.862 --> 02:17:52.965 region:rollup2
CONVINCE PEOPLE BUT CERTAINLY

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:55.134 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON WHAT'S.

02:17:52.965 --> 02:17:56.635 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ON IN WRITING IN STATUE

02:17:55.134 --> 02:17:58.337 region:rollup2
IN AND I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:17:56.635 --> 02:18:00.372 region:rollup2
WELL AND AGAIN I I KNOW I TALKED

02:17:58.337 --> 02:18:02.574 region:rollup2
A LOT ABOUT SIX SEVENTEEN IN THE

02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:04.877 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF THIS HEARING TODAY.

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:06.345 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS A REASON FOR THAT

02:18:04.877 --> 02:18:09.414 region:rollup2
HOME WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:18:06.345 --> 02:18:11.617 region:rollup2
FACT THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE.

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:13.318 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL CONCERN OF PEOPLE

02:18:11.617 --> 02:18:15.320 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

02:18:13.318 --> 02:18:17.489 region:rollup2
IS NOT ABOUT THE CO TWO

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:18.557 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

02:18:17.489 --> 02:18:21.293 region:rollup2
THAT FACILITIES IN THEIR

02:18:18.557 --> 02:18:22.761 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT THE TOXICS

02:18:21.293 --> 02:18:25.164 region:rollup2
AND THE HEALTH. HARMING

02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:27.466 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS AND THEY WANT TO MAKE

02:18:25.164 --> 02:18:30.869 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON

02:18:27.466 --> 02:18:33.672 region:rollup2
THOSE AND NOT ALLOWING THE. G.

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:36.008 region:rollup2
HD PROGRAM JG PROGRAM TO BECOME

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:38.143 region:rollup2
A TOOL BUT THESE COMPANIES CAN

02:18:36.008 --> 02:18:41.880 region:rollup2
USE TO INCREASE THEIR EMISSIONS

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:43.982 region:rollup2
AND WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.185 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT. OUR

02:18:43.982 --> 02:18:47.686 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROGRAMS I JUST DID A TO

02:18:46.185 --> 02:18:50.289 region:rollup2
BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WE DON'T

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:51.857 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE CURRENT PERMIT

02:18:50.289 --> 02:18:54.660 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE DISTRICTS

02:18:51.857 --> 02:18:57.996 region:rollup2
OPERATE THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW

02:18:54.660 --> 02:19:00.365 region:rollup2
BEEN A PARTY TO ALL THESE YEARS.

02:18:57.996 --> 02:19:02.534 region:rollup2
ARE ADEQUATE BECAUSE WE

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:04.069 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THE LEVELS OF

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:06.872 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN

02:19:04.069 --> 02:19:10.809 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMUNITIES SO WE HAVE TO

02:19:06.872 --> 02:19:15.681 region:rollup2
FIND BETTER TOOLS TO TO DO IT.

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:19.885 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T THINK OF THAT THE

02:19:15.681 --> 02:19:23.555 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ITSELF IS

02:19:19.885 --> 02:19:26.758 region:rollup2
A NECESSARILY EITHER THE CAUSE

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:28.861 region:rollup2
OR THE CURE FOR. THAT PROBLEM.

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:32.431 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:19:28.861 --> 02:19:33.365 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW PIGGYBACK ON A

02:19:32.431 --> 02:19:33.999 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF A MISTER GARCIA

02:19:33.365 --> 02:19:35.634 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:19:33.999 --> 02:19:38.103 region:rollup2
TO SPOKE ABOUT.

02:19:35.634 --> 02:19:38.637 region:rollup2
EARLIER AND A POLY IN OUR AGO

02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:41.673 region:rollup2
WHEN ONE OF YOUR ANSWERS.

02:19:38.637 --> 02:19:43.575 region:rollup2
I.

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:45.077 region:rollup2
IT WAS A CONVERSATION THAT HAD

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:47.079 region:rollup2
BEEN STARTED BY MISS SKINNER.

02:19:45.077 --> 02:19:47.980 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SCHOOL BEING PLANNED

02:19:47.079 --> 02:19:50.349 region:rollup2
AND YOU MADE THE STATEMENT THAT

02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:52.684 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN IS BUILDING ON.

02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:54.820 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS GOPI IMPLANTS.

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:56.154 region:rollup2
THAT SHE WAS ASKING THAT WE

02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:57.055 region:rollup2
KNOW ARE WE LOOKING AT OTHER

02:19:56.154 --> 02:20:00.058 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE WAYS IN THE

02:19:57.055 --> 02:20:01.627 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION REVOLVED AROUND

02:20:00.058 --> 02:20:02.861 region:rollup2
WATER SPECIFICALLY THERE BUT.

02:20:01.627 --> 02:20:03.962 region:rollup2
I I HAVE TO ASK THE SAME

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:04.630 region:rollup2
QUESTION THOUGH IS THAT FAIR

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.931 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE TALKING OF OUR MENTAL

02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:06.999 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ABOUT

02:20:05.931 --> 02:20:08.267 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BURDEN. TO

02:20:06.999 --> 02:20:10.102 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE SAME

02:20:08.267 --> 02:20:11.670 region:rollup2
TYPE OF FRAMEWORK THAT HAS LEFT

02:20:10.102 --> 02:20:13.038 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BEHIND COMMUNITIES

02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:14.773 region:rollup2
LIKE MINE BEHIND. FOR A LONG

02:20:13.038 --> 02:20:16.408 region:rollup2
TIME AND SHOULD WE BE DOING

02:20:14.773 --> 02:20:18.110 region:rollup2
SURELY BE RELATE A LITTLE BIT

02:20:16.408 --> 02:20:19.611 region:rollup2
LESS ON.

02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:21.313 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE I KNOW IT'S NOT

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:25.384 region:rollup2
THE FULL PORTFOLIO.

02:20:21.313 --> 02:20:26.618 region:rollup2
AND IN HERE RIGHT IT'S ABOUT.

02:20:25.384 --> 02:20:28.854 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX PERCENT BY WEIGHT SEMI

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:30.455 region:rollup2
GET TO TWENTY THIRTY.

02:20:28.854 --> 02:20:31.757 region:rollup2
SUCH A BIG CHUNK BUT IT WAS ON

02:20:30.455 --> 02:20:33.925 region:rollup2
THE HOLDING I SHOULD ARE WE ARE

02:20:31.757 --> 02:20:34.926 region:rollup2
WE. ARE WE NOT.

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:36.995 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE DOING MORE INNOVATIVE

02:20:34.926 --> 02:20:38.363 region:rollup2
STE OF WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THIS

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:39.598 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S COMMUNITIES TO LEAVE

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:41.266 region:rollup2
WE MADE ENOUGH AND AB SIX

02:20:39.598 --> 02:20:42.668 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN? WHILE I'M A PRODUCT

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:44.436 region:rollup2
AUTHOR OF THAT DELICIOUS ONE

02:20:42.668 --> 02:20:45.304 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE EQUATION IS NOT

02:20:44.436 --> 02:20:47.172 region:rollup2
GONNA SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS

02:20:45.304 --> 02:20:48.774 region:rollup2
EITHER. NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:49.775 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE

02:20:48.774 --> 02:20:51.710 region:rollup2
SOUTH FOR AWHILE AS WE MOVE TO

02:20:49.775 --> 02:20:52.911 region:rollup2
DO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO WE

02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:54.112 region:rollup2
KNOW WHY WHY AREN'T WE THINKING

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:55.414 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE BOX TO MAKE SURE

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:56.481 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON HAVE. WHAT HAS FELT

02:20:55.414 --> 02:20:57.783 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU KNOW TRICKLE DOWN

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:58.283 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTALISM THAT HAS AND

02:20:57.783 --> 02:21:01.486 region:rollup2
TRICKLE DOWN INTO HIS

02:20:58.283 --> 02:21:02.788 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO?

02:21:01.486 --> 02:21:04.489 region:rollup2
?

02:21:02.788 --> 02:21:06.091 region:rollup2
WHAT I GO TO ADVANCE

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:07.626 region:rollup2
AS WITH PEOPLE FROM OTHER

02:21:06.091 --> 02:21:09.061 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES WHO COME TO VISIT US

02:21:07.626 --> 02:21:09.995 region:rollup2
OR EVEN WHEN I HAVE A HOME

02:21:09.061 --> 02:21:12.130 region:rollup2
TRAVELED AS I HAVE A COUPLE

02:21:09.995 --> 02:21:13.999 region:rollup2
TIMES AND? AS PART OF MY JOB TOO

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:14.1000 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL EVENTS FOR PEOPLE

02:21:13.999 --> 02:21:16.168 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:21:14.1000 --> 02:21:18.236 region:rollup2
AND I TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT

02:21:16.168 --> 02:21:20.906 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE WITH INVESTING IN.

02:21:18.236 --> 02:21:22.774 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT PROCEEDS OF

02:21:20.906 --> 02:21:25.177 region:rollup2
OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. NO

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:27.446 region:rollup2
ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF ANYTHING

02:21:25.177 --> 02:21:28.980 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT BEFORE THEY DON'T EVEN

02:21:27.446 --> 02:21:31.149 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE TERM

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:32.551 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS NOT I

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:34.653 region:rollup2
MEAN THEY VAGUELY UNDERSTAND

02:21:32.551 --> 02:21:36.521 region:rollup2
WHAT IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING BUT.

02:21:34.653 --> 02:21:39.791 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:40.792 region:rollup2
WORK TO IDENTIFY AREAS AND THEN

02:21:39.791 --> 02:21:44.663 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT.

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:47.199 region:rollup2
WHO'S A SUBJECTED TO OF BOTH

02:21:44.663 --> 02:21:47.799 region:rollup2
THE. EXPECT CONCERNS ABOUT

02:21:47.199 --> 02:21:50.936 region:rollup2
POVERTY OR ISOLATION AND ALSO

02:21:47.799 --> 02:21:54.473 region:rollup2
OF.

02:21:50.936 --> 02:21:55.540 region:rollup2
IT BE LAYERING ON OF DIFFERENT

02:21:54.473 --> 02:21:57.509 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS SOURCES.

02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:01.146 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE'RE USING OUR PROGRAM

02:21:57.509 --> 02:22:03.815 region:rollup2
AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

02:22:01.146 --> 02:22:06.518 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE FLABBERGASTED THE

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:07.085 region:rollup2
IDEA HAS NEVER OCCURRED TO THAT

02:22:06.518 --> 02:22:08.787 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A SAY

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:11.390 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SO BRILLIANT BUT WE

02:22:08.787 --> 02:22:13.658 region:rollup2
ARE DEFINITELY AHEAD OF.

02:22:11.390 --> 02:22:15.694 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD IN

02:22:13.658 --> 02:22:18.030 region:rollup2
TERMS OF OUR THINKING ABOUT HOW

02:22:15.694 --> 02:22:21.500 region:rollup2
TO USE OUR CLIMATE PROGRAMS AS A

02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:23.735 region:rollup2
WAY TO ADDRESS INJUSTICES NOW.

02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:25.404 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT HAS COME THROUGH

02:22:23.735 --> 02:22:27.305 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRAM AND THAT HAS BEEN

02:22:25.404 --> 02:22:29.174 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO THE BUDGET.

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:31.710 region:rollup2
BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:22:29.174 --> 02:22:32.878 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAS GONE TO A VARIETY

02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:35.447 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TWITTER

02:22:32.878 --> 02:22:37.382 region:rollup2
ONLY NOW. BEGINNING TO SHOW

02:22:35.447 --> 02:22:39.785 region:rollup2
THEIR A FAX BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM

02:22:37.382 --> 02:22:40.685 region:rollup2
IS STILL PRETTY NEW BUT WE DO

02:22:39.785 --> 02:22:43.955 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE OF YEARS OF

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:45.657 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE UNDER OUR BELTS. AND

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:47.659 region:rollup2
PROBABLY SOME CORRECTIONS TO BE

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:49.561 region:rollup2
MADE WHERE WE'RE SEEING

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:52.197 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT

02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:53.832 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THINK ARE. HELPING TO

02:22:52.197 --> 02:22:55.567 region:rollup2
MOBILIZE OTHER INVESTMENTS AND

02:22:53.832 --> 02:22:57.369 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOGETHER WITH POLICIES

02:22:55.567 --> 02:22:59.604 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY

02:22:57.369 --> 02:23:00.906 region:rollup2
TRY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:02.607 region:rollup2
LIFE AND HEALTH.

02:23:00.906 --> 02:23:05.877 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES OF

02:23:02.607 --> 02:23:07.879 region:rollup2
CONCERNED SO I THINK I'M GOING

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:09.114 region:rollup2
BACK TO SOME OF THE EARLIER

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:13.285 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

02:23:09.114 --> 02:23:14.786 region:rollup2
ADDED CENTERED THAT. MONEY

02:23:13.285 --> 02:23:16.021 region:rollup2
BUSINESS ASSEMBLYMEMBER I GUESS

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:18.390 region:rollup2
THAT I OWN THIS LEGISLATION IN

02:23:16.021 --> 02:23:19.958 region:rollup2
TERMS OF ALLOCATING SPECIFIC

02:23:18.390 --> 02:23:21.126 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THE FUNDS.

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:23.495 region:rollup2
TO.

02:23:21.126 --> 02:23:25.897 region:rollup2
TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:23:23.495 --> 02:23:27.466 region:rollup2
AND THAT POLICY DIRECTIVES THAT

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:29.334 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN.

02:23:27.466 --> 02:23:33.839 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU HAVE THE

02:23:29.334 --> 02:23:35.607 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO OUR HELP US A AND

02:23:33.839 --> 02:23:39.044 region:rollup2
AND AND FOR ALL OF US TO LOOK

02:23:35.607 --> 02:23:41.079 region:rollup2
FOR. MORE CREATIVE WAYS TO ADD

02:23:39.044 --> 02:23:42.948 region:rollup2
TO DO GOOD MONEY IN AND OF

02:23:41.079 --> 02:23:45.083 region:rollup2
ITSELF ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE ALL

02:23:42.948 --> 02:23:49.187 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS BUT IT DEFINITELY

02:23:45.083 --> 02:23:51.456 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF.

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:52.624 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT. WHEN AND

02:23:51.456 --> 02:23:54.159 region:rollup2
THAT AS HIS FACE LOOK AT MORE

02:23:52.624 --> 02:23:55.193 region:rollup2
CREATIVE WAYS.

02:23:54.159 --> 02:23:55.427 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE TRANSPORTATION

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.295 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

02:23:55.427 --> 02:23:59.097 region:rollup2
.

02:23:57.295 --> 02:24:02.167 region:rollup2
MORE AND AND WITH MORE URGENCY

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:04.369 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT AND I. I PLAY

02:24:02.167 --> 02:24:06.271 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WITH THE MAPPING TOOL

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:08.106 region:rollup2
VENUE PRESENTED THE VIDEO AND I

02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:10.542 region:rollup2
PULLED UP WITH MY DISTRICT SO.

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:12.811 region:rollup2
UNDER THAT I HAD SIX FACILITIES

02:24:10.542 --> 02:24:14.312 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AFFECTED. INCOME TRADE

02:24:12.811 --> 02:24:16.047 region:rollup2
OF THE WHEN I LOOK AT MY MAP

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:18.149 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL PRETTY BRIGHT RED AND

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:19.417 region:rollup2
IT'S A SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR THAT

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:20.886 region:rollup2
MOVES ALL THE GOOD FROM THE FOR

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.953 region:rollup2
A LONG BEACH TO THE VALUE OUT OF

02:24:20.886 --> 02:24:23.188 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT AND THEN ON TO THE

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:24.523 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSES ON THE OTHER SIDE.

02:24:23.188 --> 02:24:27.425 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AFFECTING ME CLARITY

02:24:24.523 --> 02:24:29.127 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS MY

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:31.163 region:rollup2
BIGGER ISSUE ABILITIES SHE AND

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:31.763 region:rollup2
OTHER POLLUTANTS OUT THERE AND

02:24:31.163 --> 02:24:35.500 region:rollup2
SO.

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:37.602 region:rollup2
THIS OVER RELIANCE ON CAP AND

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.271 region:rollup2
TRADE.

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:40.705 region:rollup2
MIGHT WORK A WHOLE SYSTEM BUT

02:24:39.271 --> 02:24:41.873 region:rollup2
MAYBE MIGHT STILL CONTINUE TO

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:43.475 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BEHIND.

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:44.876 region:rollup2
AND SO I JUST THINK WE NEED TO

02:24:43.475 --> 02:24:47.312 region:rollup2
BE COGNIZANT OF THAT I DO THINK

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:49.014 region:rollup2
IN SOME FAIRNESS AB SIX

02:24:47.312 --> 02:24:50.682 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WILL DRESS.

02:24:49.014 --> 02:24:52.083 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS ISSUE AND I I AM

02:24:50.682 --> 02:24:53.685 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THE TO STOP US THE

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:54.753 region:rollup2
OUT THERE BUT I ALSO KNOW ITS

02:24:53.685 --> 02:24:57.022 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS AND FUNDING AND

02:24:54.753 --> 02:24:58.590 region:rollup2
ITSELF. BE ENOUGH AND SO.

02:24:57.022 --> 02:24:59.925 region:rollup2
AYE AYE DO YOU JUST ENCOURAGE

02:24:58.590 --> 02:25:02.027 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE THINK ABOUT

02:24:59.925 --> 02:25:03.662 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE WHAT MORE INNOVATION

02:25:02.027 --> 02:25:05.330 region:rollup2
IN THAT SECTOR.

02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:07.065 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:10.001 region:rollup2
DO I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR

02:25:07.065 --> 02:25:11.303 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:14.039 region:rollup2
THEN THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA

02:25:11.303 --> 02:25:17.442 region:rollup2
MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT

02:25:14.039 --> 02:25:20.245 region:rollup2

NEAR ZERO AND ALSO A MEMBER OF

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:08.059 region:rollup2
THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET

02:26:06.925 --> 02:26:09.661 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WAS SET

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:10.795 region:rollup2
UP BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT.

02:26:09.661 --> 02:26:12.097 region:rollup2
A SPEAK TODAY JUST TODAY MY

PERSONAL CAPACITY.

02:26:12.097 --> 02:26:14.566 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE A VERY BRIEF REMARK

02:26:13.131 --> 02:26:15.800 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SCOPING

02:26:14.566 --> 02:26:17.102 region:rollup2
PLAN BUILDING OFF WHAT DOCTOR

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.870 region:rollup2
BROWN MENTIONED. IT'S VERY

02:26:17.102 --> 02:26:20.038 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THAT

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:21.740 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE SCOPING PLAN

02:26:20.038 --> 02:26:23.174 region:rollup2
CALCULATES EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:24.576 region:rollup2
IS BY PROJECTING THE TOTAL

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:25.944 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED. THAN

02:26:24.576 --> 02:26:27.879 region:rollup2
TAKING A LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC

02:26:25.944 --> 02:26:28.980 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ACTIONS THINGS LIKE

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:30.615 region:rollup2
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD A

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.149 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:33.018 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REASONABLY WELL

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:34.753 region:rollup2
QUANTIFIED. AND THEN ESTIMATING

02:26:33.018 --> 02:26:37.656 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS OF THOSE PROGRAMS.

02:26:34.753 --> 02:26:39.257 region:rollup2
THE GAP BETWEEN THAT AND THE

02:26:37.656 --> 02:26:40.291 region:rollup2
TARGET IS LEFT TO CAP AND TRADE.

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:42.293 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO ANALYSIS IN THE

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:43.762 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN. OF WHAT MARKET

02:26:42.293 --> 02:26:45.330 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR CAP AND TRADE IS

02:26:43.762 --> 02:26:47.065 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE

02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:48.366 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES NO ANALYSIS.

02:26:47.065 --> 02:26:50.935 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

02:26:48.366 --> 02:26:51.803 region:rollup2
CONSIDER BECAUSE AS MANY MEMBERS

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:53.204 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMITTEE.

02:26:51.803 --> 02:26:54.639 region:rollup2
TO COMMITTEES OF MENTION TODAY

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:55.840 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE IS THE SINGLE

02:26:54.639 --> 02:26:57.609 region:rollup2
LARGEST PIECE OF THE SCOPING

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:58.643 region:rollup2
PLAN IT'S THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT

02:26:57.609 --> 02:27:00.111 region:rollup2
OF THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS

02:26:58.643 --> 02:27:01.313 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BECAUSE FOR OVER THE

02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:03.114 region:rollup2
NEXT DECADE AND IT'S ABOUT FORTY

02:27:01.313 --> 02:27:04.249 region:rollup2
FIVE OR FORTY SIX PERCENT. OF

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:06.685 region:rollup2
THE REDUCTIONS AIR BECAUSE FOR

02:27:04.249 --> 02:27:08.186 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY THIRTY THAT IS A VERY

02:27:06.685 --> 02:27:09.621 region:rollup2
LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT.

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:12.023 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NO ANALYSIS OF HOW

02:27:09.621 --> 02:27:13.024 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM WILL DELIVER ON THE

02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:14.693 region:rollup2
GOAL THAT AIR BE HAS STATED FOR

02:27:13.024 --> 02:27:15.960 region:rollup2
IT. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY

02:27:14.693 --> 02:27:18.096 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO MONITORING TO WATCH

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.397 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD I'M MINDFUL ALSO

02:27:18.096 --> 02:27:20.699 region:rollup2
THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WAS

REGULATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S A

02:27:26.471 --> 02:27:28.773 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO SEE

02:27:27.372 --> 02:27:30.942 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:32.344 region:rollup2
PROCESSES SO THAT THIS PROGRAM.

02:27:30.942 --> 02:27:34.379 region:rollup2
WHATEVER FLAWS VERY STAKEHOLDER

02:27:32.344 --> 02:27:36.448 region:rollup2
SEEN THE PROGRAM DELIVERS ON THE

02:27:34.379 --> 02:27:36.948 region:rollup2
COMPONENT THAT AREAS CALLED FOR

02:27:36.448 --> 02:27:40.051 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE SINGLE LARGEST

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:40.985 region:rollup2
COMPONENT. OF OUR CLIMATE PLAN

02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:44.556 region:rollup2
ISN'T CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

REPRESENTS TEN ENVIRONMENTAL

02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:55.467 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:56.835 region:rollup2
THE STATE WANNA THINKS AT LEAST

02:27:55.467 --> 02:27:57.869 region:rollup2
I WITH SO HIGH WE HAVE.

02:27:56.835 --> 02:27:58.703 region:rollup2
CLOSELY FOLLOWED THIS ISSUE FOR

02:27:57.869 --> 02:27:59.571 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS REASONS AND WE WERE

02:27:58.703 --> 02:28:01.673 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AT THE BOARD MEETING

02:27:59.571 --> 02:28:03.208 region:rollup2
LAST DECEMBER AND ONE OF THINGS

02:28:01.673 --> 02:28:04.342 region:rollup2
THAT WE SAW IS REALLY CALLING

02:28:03.208 --> 02:28:05.877 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE AS A DIRECT

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:06.678 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS REDUCTION MEASURE. AND

02:28:05.877 --> 02:28:08.480 region:rollup2
FOR US IS A LITTLE BIT

02:28:06.678 --> 02:28:09.948 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THAT IT DOES

02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:11.950 region:rollup2
GIVE US DIRECT EMISSIONS BUT IS

02:28:09.948 --> 02:28:13.418 region:rollup2
NOT A MEASURE THAT GIVES US A.

02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:14.753 region:rollup2
DIRECT EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE

02:28:13.418 --> 02:28:15.887 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY AT THE FACILITY

02:28:14.753 --> 02:28:17.422 region:rollup2
SOURCES WERE A LOT OF OUR

02:28:15.887 --> 02:28:19.023 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS

02:28:17.422 --> 02:28:20.592 region:rollup2
ARE BASE OUT. HE WANTED THINGS

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:22.794 region:rollup2
AS MENTIONED BIAS MEMBER GARCIA

02:28:20.592 --> 02:28:24.763 region:rollup2
IS HOW DO WE SEE IMPLEMENTATION

02:28:22.794 --> 02:28:25.897 region:rollup2
OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN INCOME IN

02:28:24.763 --> 02:28:27.799 region:rollup2
ON COMPLEMENT AND REALLY

02:28:25.897 --> 02:28:29.868 region:rollup2
COMPLIMENTING CAP AND TRADE. AND

02:28:27.799 --> 02:28:31.703 region:rollup2
I REALLY REPLACING AN AND FOR US

02:28:29.868 --> 02:28:33.371 region:rollup2
IS REALLY SEEN THOSE REDUCTIONS

02:28:31.703 --> 02:28:35.039 region:rollup2
WERE LARGE CESSATION SOURCES ARE

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:36.407 region:rollup2
LOCATED SPECIFICALLY ALSO MOBILE

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:38.176 region:rollup2
FORCES AND REALLY GETTING A

02:28:36.407 --> 02:28:39.177 region:rollup2
SENSE OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE. OF

02:28:38.176 --> 02:28:41.212 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE MOBILE FORCES

02:28:39.177 --> 02:28:43.715 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS OF RELEASED FROM TO

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:47.585 region:rollup2
SEE. TO REALLY MEET OUR TWENTY

02:28:43.715 --> 02:28:51.423 region:rollup2
THIRTY TARGETS BUT ALSO LOOKING

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:52.824 region:rollup2
AT HOW AB ONE. I'M SIX ONE SEVEN

02:28:51.423 --> 02:28:56.795 region:rollup2
SIX ONE SEVEN.

02:28:52.824 --> 02:28:59.431 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY COMPLEMENT THE CAP

02:28:56.795 --> 02:29:01.833 region:rollup2
AND TRADE A REDUCTIONS ARE

02:28:59.431 --> 02:29:04.969 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

02:29:01.833 --> 02:29:07.672 region:rollup2
INSIST TODAY WITH REDUCTIONS

02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:09.841 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE CURRENTLY THE

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:12.243 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN BUT IT'S NOT

02:29:09.841 --> 02:29:14.712 region:rollup2
REPLACING IT BECAUSE SIX ONE

02:29:12.243 --> 02:29:17.115 region:rollup2
SEVEN IT IS SOMETHING THEIR

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:19.884 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE UTILIZING BUT

02:29:17.115 --> 02:29:23.221 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE ONE FIXING

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:26.124 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE. THAT

02:29:23.221 --> 02:29:28.593 region:rollup2
VOCALIZE POLLUTION MONIES TO BE

02:29:26.124 --> 02:29:30.829 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE

02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:31.462 region:rollup2
CRITERIA.

02:29:30.829 --> 02:29:38.770 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WE MOVING FORWARD AND

WITH CARVE STAFF AND REALLY

02:29:42.574 --> 02:29:46.678 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES AND WE

REALLY HOPE AND THE NEXT ON

02:29:46.678 --> 02:29:50.014 region:rollup2
COUPLE MONTHS AND NEXT YEAR WE

02:29:47.679 --> 02:29:52.116 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY FINALIZE.

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:53.918 region:rollup2
POSTSCRIPT UPON THAT CAN

02:29:52.116 --> 02:29:55.887 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A SOME BUT IT

02:29:53.918 --> 02:29:57.088 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIONS THAT WE REALLY WANT

02:29:55.887 --> 02:29:59.557 region:rollup2
TO SEE.

02:29:57.088 --> 02:30:02.360 region:rollup2
FOR US NUMBER ONE AT THE SOURCE

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:05.463 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO IS REALLY GETTING A

TRANSPARENT SEN THE TRANSPARENCY

02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:12.170 region:rollup2
OF HOW ARE THESE.

02:30:07.799 --> 02:30:14.038 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS GOING TO BE DONE AND.

02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:18.476 region:rollup2
IN WHAT TIMEFRAME FOR US TO GET

02:30:14.038 --> 02:30:21.279 region:rollup2
A SENSE OF HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE

02:30:18.476 --> 02:30:25.049 region:rollup2
THIS THESE ISSUES IN THESE.

02:30:21.279 --> 02:30:26.551 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO OUR COMMUNITY

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:29.153 region:rollup2
MEMBERS SO THANK YOU.

02:30:26.551 --> 02:30:30.121 region:rollup2
DEAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I

RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A YEAR

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:33.691 region:rollup2
AND A HALF WORKING IN MEXICO'S

02:30:32.023 --> 02:30:34.792 region:rollup2
MINISTER THE ENVIRONMENT HAVING

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:36.261 region:rollup2
THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEVELOP A

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:37.662 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. LIKE

02:30:36.261 --> 02:30:39.063 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S

02:30:37.662 --> 02:30:39.664 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MAIN STICKING POINTS

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:45.803 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT GASOLINE PRICES

02:30:39.664 --> 02:30:47.171 region:rollup2
BOARD ALSO

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:49.007 region:rollup2
REDUCE EMISSIONS.

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:50.241 region:rollup2
I'M PERSONALLY NOT AGAINST

02:30:49.007 --> 02:30:51.476 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN GASOLINE PRICES BUT

02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:53.678 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE CLEAR TO CALIFORNIA

02:30:51.476 --> 02:30:54.245 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS

02:30:53.678 --> 02:30:55.280 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA JUST CAPS

02:30:54.245 --> 02:30:57.649 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:59.017 region:rollup2
A RECENT PUBLICATION BY UC DAVIS

02:30:57.649 --> 02:31:00.618 region:rollup2
UC BERKELEY AND STANFORD

02:30:59.017 --> 02:31:02.420 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS SAID THAT YOU WOULD

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:04.322 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GET ABOUT FOUR MILLION

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.992 region:rollup2
EXTRA TONS REDUCTION INDUCED PER

02:31:04.322 --> 02:31:10.828 region:rollup2
YEAR. BY CHANGING THE CAPS.

02:31:07.992 --> 02:31:11.896 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT NOTHING BUT IS

02:31:10.828 --> 02:31:13.831 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE THIRTY SIX

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:17.902 region:rollup2
BILLION TONS OF EMISSIONS

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:18.536 region:rollup2
WORLDWIDE IT IS ALMOST NOTHING.

02:31:17.902 --> 02:31:19.637 region:rollup2
NOW THIS GETS MY POINT UP FINAL

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.471 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:21.439 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IF WE KEEP MESSING WITH

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:22.607 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM.

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:24.108 region:rollup2
IT GETS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE

02:31:22.607 --> 02:31:24.943 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AND OTHER

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:27.512 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WILL NOT WANT TO

02:31:24.943 --> 02:31:28.780 region:rollup2
FOLLOW OUR LEAD.

02:31:27.512 --> 02:31:29.781 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CANCEL CLIMATE CHANGE

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:30.949 region:rollup2
ON ITS OWN BECAUSE WE REPRESENT

02:31:29.781 --> 02:31:32.817 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF GLOBAL

02:31:30.949 --> 02:31:34.352 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:36.621 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE NOT INSPIRING OTHER

02:31:34.352 --> 02:31:39.757 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS TO FOLLOW US THEN

02:31:36.621 --> 02:31:41.359 region:rollup2
THESE EFFORTS WILL BE FOR NOT.

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:42.894 region:rollup2
AS WE DEBATE THE FINER DE

02:31:41.359 --> 02:31:44.562 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF CAP AND TRADE. THE

02:31:42.894 --> 02:31:45.897 region:rollup2
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS BUILDING

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:47.365 region:rollup2
WALLS AND.

02:31:45.897 --> 02:31:50.468 region:rollup2
DISMANTLING OBAMA'S EFFORTS TO

02:31:47.365 --> 02:31:51.569 region:rollup2
REDUCE EMISSIONS.

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:53.037 region:rollup2
SO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:55.106 region:rollup2
PROGRAM MORE INCLUSIVE AND OPEN

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:56.140 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN MORE ISOLATIONIST.

02:31:55.106 --> 02:31:57.342 region:rollup2
I'M JOHN DONVAN REPRESENTING THE

RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS KEY

02:32:23.301 --> 02:32:27.305 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST

CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND STATE

02:32:37.382 --> 02:32:39.050 region:rollup2
POLICY SHOULD SUPPORT THIS

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:40.752 region:rollup2
EFFORT. MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLE

02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:41.919 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA

COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE I'D JUST

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:47.805 region:rollup2
LIKE US TO KEEP IN MIND THAT.

02:35:46.504 --> 02:35:49.006 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING

02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:50.274 region:rollup2
ON WHERE WE'VE COME FROM BUT

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:52.009 region:rollup2
ALSO WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:54.111 region:rollup2
WHERE SCIENCE TELLS US WE NEED

02:35:52.009 --> 02:35:55.980 region:rollup2
TO GET TO. AS THE URGENCY OF THE

02:35:54.111 --> 02:35:57.248 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CRISIS IS CONTINUING TO

02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:59.350 region:rollup2
INCREASE AS WE'RE HAVING

02:35:57.248 --> 02:36:00.785 region:rollup2
UNEXPECTED EVENTS LIKE THE WILD

02:35:59.350 --> 02:36:02.787 region:rollup2
FIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR.

02:36:00.785 --> 02:36:04.922 region:rollup2
WE MUST THINK ABOUT EVERY

02:36:02.787 --> 02:36:06.490 region:rollup2
DECISION NOT JUST LARGE SCALE

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:08.125 region:rollup2
BUT SMALL SCALE. R. MATTERS

02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:08.593 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE POLICY DISCRETION

02:36:08.125 --> 02:36:09.894 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

02:36:08.593 --> 02:36:11.629 region:rollup2
DISCRETION.

02:36:09.894 --> 02:36:13.497 region:rollup2
AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS

02:36:11.629 --> 02:36:15.132 region:rollup2
IS HELPING US TO ACCELERATE TO

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:15.766 region:rollup2
KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASING

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:17.235 region:rollup2
URGENCY THAT SCIENCE IS TELLING

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:18.803 region:rollup2
US.

02:36:17.235 --> 02:36:19.837 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER IT'S SLOWING US DOWN

02:36:18.803 --> 02:36:21.639 region:rollup2
MAY THINK THAT PERTAINS TO

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:22.506 region:rollup2
ISSUES RELATED TO.

02:36:21.639 --> 02:36:24.308 region:rollup2
THE CARBON MARKET DESIGN THE

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:26.344 region:rollup2
CEILING PRICE.

SPEED BUMPS.

02:36:26.344 --> 02:36:29.280 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO WITH THE OVERHANG

02:36:27.545 --> 02:36:30.915 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES AND ALSO WHAT TO DO

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:32.617 region:rollup2
WITH COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES SUCH

02:36:30.915 --> 02:36:33.217 region:rollup2
AS LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

02:36:32.617 --> 02:36:34.485 region:rollup2
CLEAN CARS INITIATIVES AND SO

02:36:33.217 --> 02:36:36.420 region:rollup2
ON?

02:36:34.485 --> 02:36:38.990 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK. FOCUSING ON ANY

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:40.424 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL POLICY SAYING THIS

02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:41.759 region:rollup2

IS.

02:36:44.762 --> 02:36:47.898 region:rollup2
A DANGEROUS PATH TO GO DOWN WE

02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:50.134 region:rollup2
SHOULD FOCUS ON THE OVERALL

02:36:47.898 --> 02:36:51.235 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION. SHOULD

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:53.571 region:rollup2
WE BE MAKING CHOICES WITH A VIEW

WITH A VIEW TOWARDS.

02:36:55.306 --> 02:36:59.243 region:rollup2
KEEPING COSTS LOW.

02:36:56.741 --> 02:36:59.844 region:rollup2
IT POTENTIALLY AT THE RISK OF

02:36:59.243 --> 02:37:03.881 region:rollup2
SLOWING OUR EFFORTS NOW THANK

IN GENERAL VERY SUPPORTIVE

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:40.851 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING PLAN WAS ADOPTED A

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:42.119 region:rollup2
COUPLE THINGS ON HIS FLAG THAT

02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:43.354 region:rollup2
WE RATE IN OUR RECENT COMMENTS

02:37:42.119 --> 02:37:44.922 region:rollup2
TO CARVE.

02:37:43.354 --> 02:37:46.924 region:rollup2
ON THE PLAN ONE.

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:48.092 region:rollup2
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN

02:37:46.924 --> 02:37:49.226 region:rollup2
STRONGER COMMITMENTS AROUND

I'M CENTER SKINNER BROUGHT IT UP

02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:55.900 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S

02:37:54.265 --> 02:37:56.901 region:rollup2
AN AREA THAT. I MIGHT EVERY

02:37:55.900 --> 02:37:58.235 region:rollup2

IN EXPLORING FURTHER. ON AND

02:37:58.235 --> 02:38:01.105 region:rollup2
THEN ON ON VEHICLE EXTRICATION

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:03.574 region:rollup2
THERE'S OF COURSE A LOT OF THE

SCOPING PLAN.

02:38:06.877 --> 02:38:09.580 region:rollup2
ONE AREA WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:38:08.346 --> 02:38:10.147 region:rollup2
SING GREATER COMMITMENT WAS ON

02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:11.515 region:rollup2

AND AND.

02:38:12.616 --> 02:38:15.353 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT IS SOME TYPE OF

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:20.291 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ACTION.

COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS.

02:40:07.798 --> 02:40:11.368 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST I I REALLY WANT TO

02:40:09.467 --> 02:40:13.504 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT THE CAP AND TRADE

02:40:11.368 --> 02:40:14.104 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS WORKING AND IT'S

02:40:13.504 --> 02:40:16.373 region:rollup2
DOING WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO

02:40:14.104 --> 02:40:17.741 region:rollup2
DO.

02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:19.577 region:rollup2
IT IS THE BACKSTOPS THAT

02:40:17.741 --> 02:40:20.644 region:rollup2
INSURERS CALIFORNIA WILL MEET

02:40:19.577 --> 02:40:22.780 region:rollup2
OUR CLIMATE TARGETS.

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:24.849 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S DOING THAT.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.750 region:rollup2
CARBON EMISSIONS ARE DECREASING

02:40:24.849 --> 02:40:28.385 region:rollup2
AND WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TO

02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:29.720 region:rollup2
MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY TARGET.

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:31.622 region:rollup2
EVEN WHILE WE'VE SEEN ROBUST

02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:33.791 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

02:40:31.622 --> 02:40:35.893 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME WE CERTAINLY

02:40:33.791 --> 02:40:37.962 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT MORE CAN AND

02:40:35.893 --> 02:40:39.330 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS LOCAL

02:40:37.962 --> 02:40:41.098 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY AND TRANSPORTATION

02:40:39.330 --> 02:40:42.800 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS. THROUGH TOOLS

02:40:41.098 --> 02:40:44.668 region:rollup2
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:46.570 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES.

02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:48.305 region:rollup2
AND THE SCOPING PLAN IS ABOUT

02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:50.107 region:rollup2
ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE

02:40:48.305 --> 02:40:52.776 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND TOOLS THAT WORK

02:40:50.107 --> 02:40:54.712 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:56.814 region:rollup2
CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY ISSUES.

02:40:54.712 --> 02:40:57.047 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE ISN'T THE ONLY

02:40:56.814 --> 02:40:59.350 region:rollup2
PLAYER.

02:40:57.047 --> 02:41:01.018 region:rollup2
ON THAT TEAM. PROGRAMS LIKE THE

02:40:59.350 --> 02:41:02.386 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IN

02:41:01.018 --> 02:41:04.155 region:rollup2
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:06.323 region:rollup2
HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND DIFFERENT

02:41:04.155 --> 02:41:06.857 region:rollup2
ROLE TO PLAY ON THAT TEAM IN

02:41:06.323 --> 02:41:08.425 region:rollup2
MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY

02:41:06.857 --> 02:41:09.860 region:rollup2
TARGET.

02:41:08.425 --> 02:41:10.961 region:rollup2
AND DECREASING EMISSIONS

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:12.530 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY TRANSPORTATION

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:14.465 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

02:41:12.530 --> 02:41:16.567 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE

02:41:14.465 --> 02:41:18.202 region:rollup2
CAN AND SHOULD DO MORE.

02:41:16.567 --> 02:41:19.370 region:rollup2
ON TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS

02:41:18.202 --> 02:41:19.837 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THOSE

02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:21.605 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:41:19.837 --> 02:41:23.007 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:41:21.605 --> 02:41:25.042 region:rollup2
AND AND THE LAST POINT I JUST

02:41:23.007 --> 02:41:27.511 region:rollup2
WANTED TO REFERENCE BACK TO

02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:29.513 region:rollup2
CHAIR NICHOLS COMMENT AND AND

02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:30.548 region:rollup2

02:41:29.513 --> 02:41:32.616 region:rollup2
FROM FROM HER AND FROM CARVE

02:41:30.548 --> 02:41:34.285 region:rollup2
THAT. CAP AND TRADE WILL DRIVE

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:36.053 region:rollup2
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND

02:41:34.285 --> 02:41:38.923 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE HAVE SEEN NOW BUT IT

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:40.224 region:rollup2
IS NOT A DIRECT MEASURE. AND SO

02:41:38.923 --> 02:41:41.859 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION

02:41:40.224 --> 02:41:43.561 region:rollup2
WE THINK IN LIGHT OF AB ONE

02:41:41.859 --> 02:41:45.729 region:rollup2
NINETY SEVEN AND DOESN'T

02:41:43.561 --> 02:41:47.731 region:rollup2
UNDERMINE THE IMPORTANT PURPOSE

02:41:45.729 --> 02:41:49.433 region:rollup2
OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. AND SO

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:51.635 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANTED TO TO ECHO THOSE

TRADE IS IS PUBLIC CENTRAL TO US

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:10.654 region:rollup2
AS MOST OF OUR MEMBERS WE HAVE

TWENTY ONE MEMBERS WHO ARE

02:42:10.654 --> 02:42:13.591 region:rollup2

.

02:42:16.227 --> 02:42:19.396 region:rollup2
WHEN AB THIRTY TO FIRST START OF

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:21.599 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND TRADE WAS CONSIDERED

02:42:19.396 --> 02:42:23.100 region:rollup2
A LEAKAGE PREVENTION. PROGRAM.

02:42:21.599 --> 02:42:24.268 region:rollup2
IT WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:25.970 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WHO WERE SUBJECT THE

02:42:24.268 --> 02:42:27.771 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE TO BE ABLE TO MEET

02:42:25.970 --> 02:42:29.340 region:rollup2
THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. IN

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:31.075 region:rollup2
THE LEAST COST MANNER WHILE WE

02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:33.010 region:rollup2
WERE WAITING FOR TECHNOLOGIES

02:42:31.075 --> 02:42:34.979 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD THEN. INCORPORATE

02:42:33.010 --> 02:42:37.081 region:rollup2
INTO OUR FACILITIES TACTIC THEN

02:42:34.979 --> 02:42:37.648 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO BUY THOSE ALLOWANCES

02:42:37.081 --> 02:42:39.883 region:rollup2
AND BECOME MORE EFFICIENT.

02:42:37.648 --> 02:42:41.585 region:rollup2
.

02:42:39.883 --> 02:42:44.288 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HAS

02:42:41.585 --> 02:42:45.556 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY VERY SLOW AND.

02:42:44.288 --> 02:42:47.157 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR

02:42:45.556 --> 02:42:48.926 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY GOALS WE'RE GOING

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:50.728 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO INCREASE THAT IN

02:42:48.926 --> 02:42:51.996 region:rollup2
ORDER TO ALLOW THOSE COMPANIES

02:42:50.728 --> 02:42:54.098 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO TO MEET THOSE

02:42:51.996 --> 02:42:56.333 region:rollup2
THOSE OBLIGATIONS.

02:42:54.098 --> 02:42:57.768 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THE END.

02:42:56.333 --> 02:42:59.436 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE IS NOT AS AS

02:42:57.768 --> 02:43:01.405 region:rollup2
MISTER KHtNG WORDS AND.

02:42:59.436 --> 02:43:03.173 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE IS CENTRAL TO THIS

02:43:01.405 --> 02:43:04.074 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF OF

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:05.843 region:rollup2
OUR ENTIRE.

02:43:04.074 --> 02:43:08.245 region:rollup2
GOALS PROCESS HERE HOWEVER IT'S

02:43:05.843 --> 02:43:09.179 region:rollup2
ALSO THE BACKSTOPS.

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:10.314 region:rollup2
IN FOR ALL THE OTHER

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:12.016 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES YOU SEE

02:43:10.314 --> 02:43:13.817 region:rollup2
AND NOW LIST.

02:43:12.016 --> 02:43:15.753 region:rollup2
ANY OF THEM THAT FAIL TO MEET

02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:17.688 region:rollup2
THEIR REDUCTION GOALS FALLS ON

02:43:15.753 --> 02:43:18.989 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE FACILITIES.

02:43:17.688 --> 02:43:20.591 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS IT'S NOT JUST THIRTY

02:43:18.989 --> 02:43:21.525 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT IT COULD BE FORTY

02:43:20.591 --> 02:43:22.459 region:rollup2
PERCENT IT COULD BE FIFTY

02:43:21.525 --> 02:43:24.328 region:rollup2
PERCENT IT COULD BE SIXTY

02:43:22.459 --> 02:43:25.195 region:rollup2
PERCENT COULD BE BIGGER.

02:43:24.328 --> 02:43:26.730 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOING TO REALLY

02:43:25.195 --> 02:43:28.232 region:rollup2
AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:29.566 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE.

02:43:28.232 --> 02:43:31.602 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S THE CASE.

02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:33.070 region:rollup2
SO.

02:43:31.602 --> 02:43:35.105 region:rollup2
I AM URGING RIGHT NOW AS I'VE

02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:37.107 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAVE IS THAT WE NEED TO

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:39.043 region:rollup2
REALLY INCREASE.

02:43:37.107 --> 02:43:39.576 region:rollup2
A FUNDING IN. RESEARCH AND

OURS IS ABLE TO RECEIVE MONEY

02:43:52.222 --> 02:43:56.694 region:rollup2
FROM THE CAP AND TRADE AND TO

02:43:54.425 --> 02:43:58.662 region:rollup2
PARLAY THAT INTO A RETROFIT OR A

02:43:56.694 --> 02:44:00.664 region:rollup2
NEW BOILER OR SOMETHING ALONG

02:43:58.662 --> 02:44:02.032 region:rollup2
THOSE LINES. THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:04.368 region:rollup2
DIRECT REDUCTION.

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:05.936 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IN AREAS THAT ARE ARE

02:44:04.368 --> 02:44:08.138 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THE IN WHEN VIRAL

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:10.140 region:rollup2
SCREEN FOR FOR LOW INCOME AREAS

02:44:08.138 --> 02:44:12.409 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE THIS

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:14.144 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO

02:44:12.409 --> 02:44:16.847 region:rollup2
START THINKING IN TERMS OF. OF

02:44:14.144 --> 02:44:18.148 region:rollup2
NOT JUST WHAT CAN WE DO BUT HOW

02:44:16.847 --> 02:44:19.416 region:rollup2
CAN WE DO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:44:18.148 --> 02:44:21.585 region:rollup2
OUR FACILITIES CONTINUE TO

02:44:19.416 --> 02:44:23.253 region:rollup2
OPERATE. AND AND THAT WE CAN

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:29.660 region:rollup2
CONTINUE RECEIVED ARE TO MEET

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:30.260 region:rollup2
OUR REDUCTION GOALS THANK YOU.

02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:31.395 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:33.263 region:rollup2

02:44:42.873 --> 02:44:46.143 region:rollup2
OF INSULATION FOR DIFFERENT

02:44:44.108 --> 02:44:47.244 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS WE HAVE ONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES MAKE?

02:44:55.619 --> 02:44:58.989 region:rollup2
A FIRE GLASS BUILDING

02:44:56.653 --> 02:45:00.991 region:rollup2
INSULATION AND SINCE WE HAD

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:03.260 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DISCUSSION CONCERNING A

02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:04.161 region:rollup2
LARGE FACILITY EMISSIONS I WOULD

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.995 region:rollup2
BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION

02:45:04.161 --> 02:45:06.263 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:45:04.995 --> 02:45:08.165 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO JOHN SMITH BILL

02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:10.367 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN A VERY.

02:45:08.165 --> 02:45:12.069 region:rollup2
LOW WIND SHEAR LOW CARB AND LOW

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:14.805 region:rollup2
EMITTING PROCESS.

02:45:12.069 --> 02:45:16.540 region:rollup2
TO MAKE OUR INSULATION AND WHEN

02:45:14.805 --> 02:45:16.740 region:rollup2
WE SWITCHED TO A FORMALDEHYDE

02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:19.510 region:rollup2
FREE.

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:21.478 region:rollup2
BINDER SOME YEARS AGO WE ALSO

02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:21.912 region:rollup2
REDUCED OUR HAZARDOUS AIR

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:24.348 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS.

02:45:21.912 --> 02:45:26.283 region:rollup2
HAS ITS AIR POLLUTION.

02:45:24.348 --> 02:45:27.184 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS BY NINETY NINE

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.786 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:45:27.184 --> 02:45:29.419 region:rollup2
IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE UPDATED

02:45:28.786 --> 02:45:31.021 region:rollup2
SCOPING PLAN.

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:32.623 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS GOING TO

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:34.091 region:rollup2
BE CALLED UPON TO ACHIEVE AROUND

02:45:32.623 --> 02:45:35.392 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT OF CUMULATIVE

02:45:34.091 --> 02:45:36.994 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:38.629 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS.

02:45:36.994 --> 02:45:39.830 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE

02:45:38.629 --> 02:45:41.698 region:rollup2
THAN DOUBLE OF WHAT.

02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:43.467 region:rollup2
I THINK THE EVEN FIFTY PERCENT

02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:44.802 region:rollup2
ARE PSS IS I'M GOING TO BE

02:45:43.467 --> 02:45:46.637 region:rollup2
CALLED ON FOR.

02:45:44.802 --> 02:45:48.372 region:rollup2
IF I COULD MAKE A.

02:45:46.637 --> 02:45:50.007 region:rollup2
ONE RECOMMENDATION ON HOW

02:45:48.372 --> 02:45:51.575 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE ON THAT

02:45:50.007 --> 02:45:53.076 region:rollup2
PART OF IT AND THAT IS THAT

02:45:51.575 --> 02:45:54.978 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF

02:45:53.076 --> 02:45:56.847 region:rollup2
UNDER INSULATED HOMES. IN THE

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:58.715 region:rollup2
STATE MIDI THEM VERY POOR

02:45:56.847 --> 02:46:01.452 region:rollup2
PERFORMERS FROM A AND ENERGY

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:02.920 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY STANDPOINT. AND.

02:46:01.452 --> 02:46:03.921 region:rollup2
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.789 region:rollup2
IF NOT MILLIONS OF THEM WILL

02:46:03.921 --> 02:46:06.890 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE RETROFITTED. IN ORDER

02:46:05.789 --> 02:46:07.958 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO ACHIEVE ITS

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:09.827 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:10.694 region:rollup2
REDUCTION GOALS NOW THERE THERE

02:46:09.827 --> 02:46:11.528 region:rollup2
ARE SOME CAP AND TREATMENT IS

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:12.796 region:rollup2
THAT EARMARKED FOR

02:46:11.528 --> 02:46:15.165 region:rollup2
WEATHERIZATION BUT IT JUST GOES

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:16.600 region:rollup2
TO THE EXISTING. LOW INCOME

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:18.268 region:rollup2
WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM.

02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:20.070 region:rollup2
IF I GET AGAIN MAKE ONE SPECIFIC

02:46:18.268 --> 02:46:21.972 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION HOPING THAT THE

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:23.807 region:rollup2
STATE MIGHT CONSIDER. A LITTLE

02:46:21.972 --> 02:46:24.475 region:rollup2
BIT OF AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE IN

02:46:23.807 --> 02:46:26.543 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

02:46:24.475 --> 02:46:29.580 region:rollup2
AYE TO DO A RETROFIT.

02:46:26.543 --> 02:46:31.081 region:rollup2
IT RESIDENTIAL RETROFITS.

02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:32.449 region:rollup2
AND ALONG THE LINES OF.

02:46:31.081 --> 02:46:34.818 region:rollup2
WHAT JOHNS MANVILLE

02:46:32.449 --> 02:46:35.953 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED IN ENOUGH A BIG

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:37.454 region:rollup2
PROJECT AND NOW THE COACHELLA

02:46:35.953 --> 02:46:39.022 region:rollup2
VALLEY?

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:40.157 region:rollup2
A MEMBER GARCIA IN YOUR IN YOUR

02:46:39.022 --> 02:46:42.292 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

02:46:40.157 --> 02:46:43.460 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE US SOUTH COAST

02:46:42.292 --> 02:46:45.162 region:rollup2
OR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:46.897 region:rollup2
WE PROVIDED BASIC ENERGY

02:46:45.162 --> 02:46:48.265 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY RETROFITS TO A TWENTY

02:46:46.897 --> 02:46:49.466 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED HOMES IN THE

02:46:48.265 --> 02:46:50.634 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AREA AND

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:51.802 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE DISADVANTAGED

02:46:50.634 --> 02:46:54.438 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:46:51.802 --> 02:46:55.906 region:rollup2
DOWN THERE AND WE WERE ABLE TO.

02:46:54.438 --> 02:46:57.407 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY NOT ONLY THE ENERGY

02:46:55.906 --> 02:46:58.809 region:rollup2
SAVINGS BUT ALSO THE EMISSION

02:46:57.407 --> 02:47:01.245 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF

02:46:58.809 --> 02:47:03.480 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND.

02:47:01.245 --> 02:47:04.014 region:rollup2
PARTICULATE TO FINE PARTICULATE

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:04.915 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

02:47:04.014 --> 02:47:06.950 region:rollup2
SO.

02:47:04.915 --> 02:47:08.519 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN ALSO YOU GET THE

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:10.554 region:rollup2
CO BENEFIT OF INCREASED HEALTH

02:47:08.519 --> 02:47:12.022 region:rollup2
AND SAFETY OF FOR THE.

02:47:10.554 --> 02:47:13.357 region:rollup2
FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND HOME

02:47:12.022 --> 02:47:15.525 region:rollup2
OCCUPANT SO. AND.

02:47:13.357 --> 02:47:16.894 region:rollup2
AND I I WOULD BE REMISS IF I

02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:18.896 region:rollup2
DIDN'T ACTUALLY INVITE.

02:47:16.894 --> 02:47:20.197 region:rollup2
ANY MEMBERS WHO WOULD BE

02:47:18.896 --> 02:47:21.164 region:rollup2
INTERESTED TO COME UP AND TO OUR

02:47:20.197 --> 02:47:24.568 region:rollup2
FACILITY.

02:47:21.164 --> 02:47:26.136 region:rollup2
I'D SAY IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A

02:47:24.568 --> 02:47:26.537 region:rollup2
FIVE PLUS INSULATION BE MADE

02:47:26.136 --> 02:47:27.204 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

02:47:26.537 --> 02:47:31.174 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING PROCESS.

02:47:27.204 --> 02:47:32.242 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:47:31.174 --> 02:47:33.610 region:rollup2
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE

02:47:32.242 --> 02:47:35.245 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY MICHAEL BROKERED R.

02:47:33.610 --> 02:47:36.947 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY

02:47:35.245 --> 02:47:38.615 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION. WANTED TO

02:47:36.947 --> 02:47:39.750 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP ON A FEW OF THE POINTS

02:47:38.615 --> 02:47:41.518 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MADE BY A CHAIR

02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:42.886 region:rollup2
NICHOLS AND THE QUESTIONS FROM.

02:47:41.518 --> 02:47:44.388 region:rollup2
.

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:45.856 region:rollup2
SENATOR SKINNER AND OTHER

02:47:44.388 --> 02:47:46.757 region:rollup2
COMMENTS EARLIER FROM A COUPLE

02:47:45.856 --> 02:47:48.525 region:rollup2
OF WITNESSES ON RENEWABLE

02:47:46.757 --> 02:47:49.559 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS.

02:47:48.525 --> 02:47:51.628 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:47:49.559 --> 02:47:52.930 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND DIRECT RESPONSE TO

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:54.131 region:rollup2
THE SCANNERS QUESTION THAT WE

02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:55.499 region:rollup2
NEED TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

02:47:54.131 --> 02:47:57.200 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS BEING USED

02:47:55.499 --> 02:47:58.969 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN OUR

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.136 region:rollup2
HOMES FOR HEATING.

02:47:58.969 --> 02:48:01.238 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:47:59.136 --> 02:48:03.273 region:rollup2
OTHER PURPOSES I WATER HEATERS

02:48:01.238 --> 02:48:05.108 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS THAT'S GONNA NEED TO

02:48:03.273 --> 02:48:05.909 region:rollup2
BE PART OF THE STRATEGY.

02:48:05.108 --> 02:48:07.244 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE GOING TO

02:48:05.909 --> 02:48:08.745 region:rollup2
TRY AND CONVINCE YOU THIS YEAR

02:48:07.244 --> 02:48:11.315 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN REPLACE ALL THAT

02:48:08.745 --> 02:48:13.417 region:rollup2
WITH A. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS

02:48:11.315 --> 02:48:15.218 region:rollup2
A REPLACEMENT FEEL IT'S JUST

02:48:13.417 --> 02:48:17.120 region:rollup2
SIMPLY NOT TRUE IT WAS

02:48:15.218 --> 02:48:18.288 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED BY AIR BE A FIVE

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.323 region:rollup2
PERCENT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

02:48:18.288 --> 02:48:21.191 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:48:19.323 --> 02:48:22.926 region:rollup2
BUT WASN'T.

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:24.628 region:rollup2
SPOKEN OF EARLIER IN TERMS OF.

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:26.596 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE AIR

02:48:24.628 --> 02:48:27.764 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BOARD WAS THE COST OF

02:48:26.596 --> 02:48:29.266 region:rollup2
THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:31.535 region:rollup2
STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA.

02:48:29.266 --> 02:48:32.970 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THREE

02:48:31.535 --> 02:48:34.738 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON OF

02:48:32.970 --> 02:48:36.139 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS REDUCTION.

02:48:34.738 --> 02:48:38.141 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN

02:48:36.139 --> 02:48:39.843 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN AND WHY ITS NOT

02:48:38.141 --> 02:48:41.511 region:rollup2
A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE STATE WE

02:48:39.843 --> 02:48:43.380 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD RENEWABLE NATURAL

02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:44.348 region:rollup2
GAS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN

02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:46.049 region:rollup2
THE FOOD PROCESSORS THAT

02:48:44.348 --> 02:48:47.351 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

02:48:46.049 --> 02:48:48.919 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THAT

02:48:47.351 --> 02:48:50.587 region:rollup2
ONE OF FORCE THAT UPON US SO BE

02:48:48.919 --> 02:48:51.321 region:rollup2
VERY CAUTIOUS AS WE HAVE THIS

02:48:50.587 --> 02:48:52.789 region:rollup2
DEBATE AND WE TALK ABOUT

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:54.524 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE GAS.

02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:56.627 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES MAKE SENSE IS THAT WE

02:48:54.524 --> 02:48:58.261 region:rollup2
CAPTURE RENEWABLE GAS?

02:48:56.627 --> 02:49:00.130 region:rollup2
FROM LANDFILLS FROM WASTE WATER

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:01.531 region:rollup2
AGENCIES IN FROM DAIRIES BECAUSE

02:49:00.130 --> 02:49:03.467 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES A TON OF SENSE THAT'S

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:04.868 region:rollup2
FUGITIVE METHANE. WE NEED TO

02:49:03.467 --> 02:49:05.969 region:rollup2
CAPTURE THAT PUT THAT TO USE

02:49:04.868 --> 02:49:07.704 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MOSTLY AS

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:09.473 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FEE ON THE STATE.

02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:11.541 region:rollup2
MAKES A TON A SENSE WHAT DOESN'T

02:49:09.473 --> 02:49:13.010 region:rollup2
MAKE SENSE IS GOING BEYOND THAT

ENTITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

CAN'T CLARIFY ON THEIR OWN I

02:49:58.255 --> 02:50:00.724 region:rollup2
THINK CHAIR NICHOLS DID A GOOD

02:49:59.256 --> 02:50:02.192 region:rollup2
JOB AT. THAT CREATING SOME

02:50:00.724 --> 02:50:03.427 region:rollup2
CLARITY AND DEFINITION AS WE

02:50:06.496 --> 02:50:09.399 region:rollup2
FAIRLY PRECISE IN YOUR LANGUAGE.

02:50:08.065 --> 02:50:10.934 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAP

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:12.436 region:rollup2
AND TRADE CAP VERSES THE SCOPING

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:13.770 region:rollup2
PLANNED CAPPER THE S. B. THIRTY

02:50:12.436 --> 02:50:15.172 region:rollup2
TWO GOALS THAT THEY ARE

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:17.107 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS YES THEY'RE

02:50:15.172 --> 02:50:18.275 region:rollup2
WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME AND BUT

02:50:17.107 --> 02:50:20.010 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT PIECES OF

02:50:18.275 --> 02:50:21.178 region:rollup2
A PUZZLE. I'M ALSO LOCAL STATE

02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:22.312 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:50:21.178 --> 02:50:24.281 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF LONG

02:50:22.312 --> 02:50:25.615 region:rollup2
STANDING. HISTORY AND HOW THOSE

02:50:24.281 --> 02:50:27.384 region:rollup2
LINES ARE DRAWN AND HOW THOSE

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:28.785 region:rollup2
THINGS WORK IN AND YOU KNOW AS

02:50:27.384 --> 02:50:30.520 region:rollup2
WE. EXAMINE THESE THINGS THERE'S

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:31.688 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TO SEE IF

02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:33.290 region:rollup2
THOSE LINES ARE THE LINES SHOULD

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:35.525 region:rollup2
BE DRAWN OR IF THEY'RE WORKING

02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:37.027 region:rollup2
AS PROPERLY. AS I THINK SOME OF

02:50:35.525 --> 02:50:38.562 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD MAYBE

02:50:37.027 --> 02:50:39.830 region:rollup2
THAT THESE LINES ARE BLURRED AND

02:50:38.562 --> 02:50:40.564 region:rollup2
I NEED TO BE CLARIFIED IT MAYBE

02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:43.133 region:rollup2
LINES ARE DRAWN IN THE WRONG

02:50:40.564 --> 02:50:44.401 region:rollup2
SPOT. AND I HOPE THAT THAT WE

02:50:43.133 --> 02:50:46.103 region:rollup2
CAN KIND OF KEEP.

02:50:44.401 --> 02:50:47.337 region:rollup2

TO BE STRUCK.

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:20.670 region:rollup2
.

02:51:19.336 --> 02:51:22.205 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OUR CARBON ALLOWANCE

02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:24.808 region:rollup2
PRICES.

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:26.643 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO

02:51:24.808 --> 02:51:29.613 region:rollup2
DRIVE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE

02:51:26.643 --> 02:51:32.382 region:rollup2
NEED AND THE BUSINESS DECISIONS.

02:51:29.613 --> 02:51:36.086 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE AND PRICES

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:37.954 region:rollup2
THAT CAN. GET SOHIGH THAT THEY

02:51:36.086 --> 02:51:38.522 region:rollup2
THREATEN OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY

02:51:37.954 --> 02:51:41.725 region:rollup2

ALL OF THE ANALYSIS AND.

02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:55.972 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT THE SCOPING PLAN

02:51:54.037 --> 02:51:58.175 region:rollup2
DOES A GREAT JOB AND BALANCE

02:51:55.972 --> 02:52:00.377 region:rollup2
MAKING DOING THIS BALANCING ACT.

02:51:58.175 --> 02:52:01.278 region:rollup2
SO.

02:52:00.377 --> 02:52:02.946 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANTED TO.

02:52:01.278 --> 02:52:04.948 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WITH OUTSIDE

02:52:02.946 --> 02:52:05.949 region:rollup2

TRACK SO.

02:52:05.949 --> 02:52:10.720 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ECHO A

02:52:08.218 --> 02:52:12.255 region:rollup2

02:52:14.925 --> 02:52:19.996 region:rollup2
STATE WHY CAP. IS FIRM.

02:52:17.561 --> 02:52:22.399 region:rollup2
AND SIGNIFICANTLY STRICT WITH A

02:52:19.996 --> 02:52:24.467 region:rollup2
GETS VERY AGGRESSIVE TO ACHIEVE

02:52:22.399 --> 02:52:25.936 region:rollup2
THAT GOAL ON EVEN IF BANKING

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:28.238 region:rollup2
ALLOWS ENTITIES.

02:52:25.936 --> 02:52:31.041 region:rollup2
TO EXCEED.

02:52:28.238 --> 02:52:33.777 region:rollup2
THAT CAP IN A GIVEN YEAR THE

02:52:31.041 --> 02:52:35.412 region:rollup2
CAP IS UP STATEWIDE AND NOT ON

02:52:33.777 --> 02:52:36.746 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES OR

02:52:35.412 --> 02:52:39.683 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

02:52:36.746 --> 02:52:40.984 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ELEGANCE OF ON THE

02:52:39.683 --> 02:52:42.018 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND

02:52:40.984 --> 02:52:44.421 region:rollup2

02:53:13.283 --> 02:53:16.519 region:rollup2
ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT OF VALOR

02:53:15.385 --> 02:53:17.587 region:rollup2
TRAILER JUST MADE ON BEHALF OF

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:18.688 region:rollup2
P. GENIE BUT I WON AT THREE

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:18.855 region:rollup2
POINTS.

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:20.957 region:rollup2
ONE.

02:53:18.855 --> 02:53:23.193 region:rollup2
.

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:27.130 region:rollup2
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ADOPTED

02:53:23.193 --> 02:53:28.231 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGES TO THEIR A CLIMATE

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:29.733 region:rollup2
STRATEGY IN THE LAST COUPLE

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:31.468 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH A LOT OF INPUT FROM

02:53:29.733 --> 02:53:33.103 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:53:31.468 --> 02:53:35.272 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOAN IMPORTANT TO

02:53:33.103 --> 02:53:36.539 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT THAT PLAN IS NOT

02:53:35.272 --> 02:53:38.041 region:rollup2
STATIC IT'S NOT LOCKED IN FOR

02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:38.975 region:rollup2
LIFE.

02:53:38.041 --> 02:53:41.278 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:44.881 region:rollup2
IT BE UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY

02:53:41.278 --> 02:53:47.217 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AND. WE. ARE LEARNING

02:53:44.881 --> 02:53:48.918 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S

02:53:47.217 --> 02:53:50.253 region:rollup2
NOT WORKING THE ENHANCEMENTS

02:53:48.918 --> 02:53:51.888 region:rollup2
THAT CAME FROM LEGISLATION LAST

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:53.256 region:rollup2
YEAR ABOUT ADDITIONAL. ON

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:54.591 region:rollup2
MONITORING REQUIREMENTS ARE

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:57.394 region:rollup2
GONNA MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

02:53:54.591 --> 02:53:59.362 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD AND INFORMING WHAT

02:53:57.394 --> 02:53:59.896 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES ARE ARE AFFECTED AND

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.163 region:rollup2
WHAT WHICH ONES WE NEED TO

02:53:59.896 --> 02:54:02.232 region:rollup2
IMPROVE.

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:03.300 region:rollup2
.

02:54:02.232 --> 02:54:05.068 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.835 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT'S IN AND PLACE.

02:54:05.068 --> 02:54:08.271 region:rollup2
SECOND POINT.

02:54:05.835 --> 02:54:10.206 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MR

02:54:08.271 --> 02:54:11.775 region:rollup2
BROKEN DOORS COMMENTS WE AGREE

02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:13.743 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY ON THE NEED TO

02:54:11.775 --> 02:54:14.811 region:rollup2
CAPTURE FUGITIVE METHANE IN THE

02:54:13.743 --> 02:54:16.546 region:rollup2
STATE AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:18.882 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. WHERE WE

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:19.916 region:rollup2
DISAGREE IS THAT WE DON'T

02:54:18.882 --> 02:54:21.618 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE LOW CARB JUST

02:54:19.916 --> 02:54:23.687 region:rollup2
IN OUR PROGRAM IS ENOUGH TO

02:54:21.618 --> 02:54:25.455 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:54:23.687 --> 02:54:27.390 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SEE IN CALIFORNIA

02:54:25.455 --> 02:54:28.992 region:rollup2
RELATED TO NO ONE NATURAL GAS?

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:31.561 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE GOING TO BE ADVOCATING

02:54:28.992 --> 02:54:33.296 region:rollup2
FOR THE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS.

02:54:31.561 --> 02:54:34.798 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT

02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:37.067 region:rollup2
AND USE OF RENEWABLE GAS IN

02:54:34.798 --> 02:54:38.368 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND LET'S HAVE A

02:54:37.067 --> 02:54:40.270 region:rollup2
HEALTHY DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THAT

02:54:38.368 --> 02:54:42.205 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE THE WE NEED MORE THAN

02:54:40.270 --> 02:54:45.141 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE.

02:54:42.205 --> 02:54:45.976 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ON SHOWN BY THE FACT

02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:47.177 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LEVEL

02:54:45.976 --> 02:54:49.312 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT. WITH NOBLE GAS

02:54:47.177 --> 02:54:50.380 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN THE STATE THAT WE

02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:52.682 region:rollup2
ALL THOUGHT WE WOULD BY NOW.

02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:54.617 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY A ON YOUR POINT AND
