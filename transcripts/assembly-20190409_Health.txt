A BEFORE SEEKS TO EXPAND MEDI CAL COVERAGE TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL REMOVES A BARRIER TO HEALTH ACCESS. DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ELECTED TO IMPOSE. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE THE LARGEST SINGLE GROUP OF UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE. YET THEY CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND ARE A MAJOR PERCENTAGE OF OUR WORKFORCE. IN CALIFORNIA. WE CANNOT REACH. UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE UNTIL CALIFORNIA REMOVES ELIGIBILITY EXCLUSIONS BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS AND MAKES MEDI CAL INCLUSIVE OF ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE. THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE TOO LITTLE MEDICARE AND RECEIVE IT TOO LATE. AS A RESULT THEY ARE SICKER AND DIE SOONER. A BEFORE WILL BRING CALIFORNIA CLOSER TO ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE WITNESSED THE BARRAGE OF ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL INCLUDING MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO REPEAL THE ACA. AND VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS THAT UNDERMINE ACCESS TO CARE. CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED TO SHIELD OUR STATE FROM THESE ATTACKS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO CHAMPION AND LEAD THE NATION. IN BOLD AND INCLUSIVE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DUE TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA'S. DUE TO OUR UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE COMPOUNDING FEARS AND CHILLING EFFECT CREATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TE QUALITY OF LIFE IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND ADDITIONAL TRAUMAS OR CREATING AND URGENCY TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROTECTED AND INSURED. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PREVENT ILLNESSES FROM DETERIORATING MANY A DOCUMENT CALIFORNIANS ONLY ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. WHERE MANY TIMES PROVIDERS ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO HELP DUE TO THE EXACERBATIONS? OF THE ILLNESS. NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS ALSO INCREASES THE DEMAND ON EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AND INCREASES COSTS. IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL COSTS THAT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE PREVENTED. WE CAN DO BETTER. WITH A BEFORE WE WILL A BEFORE BUILDS UPON THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK WITH HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS. TO HELP ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. I'M GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR TAKING THE STEP TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO YOUNG ADULTS A CONFIDENT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. TO ENSURE TO EXPAND IT TO ALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON A BEFORE. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I HAVE BRENDA LOUD ENOUGH WITH THE SO TO A COMMUNITY MEMBER HERE SHARE HER STORY. DEEP IN GUN MAY HAVE WITH CENTER FOR IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND JESSICA MORAN WITH ALL THAT HEALTH ACCESS SO YOU DO HAVE THREE WITNESSES WILL BE TOTAL SIX MINUTES AND THAT'S THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRENDA WHAT THE SUBTLE I'M A STUDENT AT UC RIVERSIDE IN THE THEIR WHICH SHIA LOVES THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. I LIVE IN IS LOS ANGELES I HAVE A TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD FROM MEXICO CITY I AM UNDOCUMENTED INTO NOT ALL FOR THAT. IN JANUARY I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM TO THIS BECAUSE HE'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE HELPFUL TO IMMIGRANT YOU'D LIKE MYSELF. THE GOVERNOR CAN BEATTY'S COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT HE LISTENED TO THE STORIES OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. I APPRECIATE HIS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND MEDICAL FOR YOUNG ADULTS HOWEVER IT WILL NOT ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING AND ECONOMIC BURDEN. FACE VALUE AND DOCUMENT THE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF IF IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR PARENTS AND OTHERS. MY MOM IS A SINGLE PARENT AND THE MOST HARD WORKING PERSON I KNOW. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY ARE YOU LOCAL WHEN SHE BEGAN HAVING THIS IN YOUR STOMACH THE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT HAVE. INSURANCE SHE GIVE HOPE IN THE HALLWAY. BUT HE CONTINUED TO GET WORSE FOR TWO WEEKS THIS IS WHAT SO MANY UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS TO THE SOFTWARE IT'S CRISTINA PAIN KEEP GOING TO WORK AND SACRIFICE THEIR OWN WELL BEING SO THEIR CHILDREN COULD CONTINUE TO GO TO SCHOOL LEARN AND HAVE A CHANCE AT A GOOD FUTURE. IT WASN'T UNTIL MY MOM COULD NO LONGER STAND UP THE WE FINALLY HAD TO TAKE HER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR TOLD US THAT HE WAS TOO LATE TO OPERATE ON HER. TO REMOVE HAPPENED IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPLODED AND COUSIN INTERNET CONNECTION. THEY HAD TO ANSWER TO ONE OF HER STOMACH TO REMOVE THE INFECTIONS OR SEE TOOLS OF THE PENDANTS. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD HAVE WAITED ANY LONGER MY MOM WOULD HAVE DIED. MY MOM'S RECOVERY TOOK ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO WORK DURING THE TIME. WITH ALL MY MOST PAYCHECKS MY FAMILY REALLY STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY ON TOP OF THAT WE HAD ON THE STAND AND MEDICAL BILL OR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING WAS COVERED BY THE MACKENZIE MEDICAL SHE APPLIED FOR AT THE TIME. GROWING UP LOW INCOME I WAS ALREADY USED TO THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO PERMIT TO SPAIN RAIN OR PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. WELL WHEN THE PRIMARY INCOME EARNERS. WAS SICK AND MISS WORK IT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL POURED INTO MY LIFE. A DOUBLE THE STRESS THE HOW THIRTY COMES WITH BEING ON THE DOCUMENT THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS. MY ABILITY TO SEE DOCTOR THEM EQUIPMENT IN ALL MY LEADERSHIP ACTIVITIES THAT UC RIVERSIDE. AND THAT TO MY FULLEST POTENTIAL IS CLOSELY TIED TO MY MOM SKILLED AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY OF MY ENTIRE HOUSE SCHOOL. MY EXPERIENCE IS THE SAME AS SO MANY OTHER ON DOCUMENT THE YOUNG CALIFORNIANS. ON ALL OF THEIR BEHALF I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO DATE AND ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEEPENING ACNE SO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER -- WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF BLOOD OF AB -- FOR TO EXPAND MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS -- AND I THINK AS WE JUST HEARD BRENDA'S STORY IS HOW INTRICATELY TIED -- STABILITY IS -- WITH HEALTHCARE ESPECIALLY ECONOMIC STABILITY AND I REALLY LIKE TO UPLIFT ONE OF THE POINTS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MADE I'M IS THAT UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS CONTRIBUTE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. EACH YEAR AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO A SYSTEM THAT THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM. FROM AGRICULTURE CONSTRUCTION DOMESTIC WORKERS TO SERVICE WORK IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE HIGH ARE HEAVILY REPRESENTED INDUSTRIES THE WITH A HIGH RISK OF INJURY ON THE JOB AND THE LOW RATE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED BENEFITS INCLUDING HEALTH INSURANCE. ONE OF THE KEY EXAMPLES IS DURING THE RECENT WILDFIRES WHERE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT WORKERS FARMWORKERS WORSE ON THE FIELD I'M EXPOSED TO THE TOXIC AIR QUALITY AND THEY WERE UNWILLING TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY NEEDED. TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I IS A DISGRACE AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE THE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS THAT THEY WILL LIKELY NEED. I'M TO THE NEGATIVE HEALTH CARE FACTS OF THAT. WATER FIRE SMOKE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPANDING MEDICAL ACCESS WE SIMPLY TALK ABOUT -- PROVIDING LIFESAVING TREATMENTS -- THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT DON'T RECEIVE MANY OTHER MEDICAL BENEFITS AND ARE IN CRITICAL NEED OF IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOUR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JUSTIN RANDALL CONTACT THIS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION I'M HERE TODAY AS A SPONSOR IMPROV SUPPORTER OF EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WOULD EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALTHOUGH INCOME. AND DOC ADULTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS BY SPENDING MEDICAL TO ALL LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS YOU'D EXPECT ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION ADULTS TO ENROLL BY. TWENTY TWENTY WHICH TO DECREASE CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE BY ABOUT A QUARTER. LOW INCOME AND DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT ARE USUALLY NOT OFFERED DOT THESE HEALTH INSURANCE IS SIMILAR TO MANY LAWFULLY PRESENT LOW INCOME WORKERS. HOWEVER 90% OF ALL UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME WORKERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. COMPARED TO ONLY 10% OF THE LAWFULLY PRESENT COUNTERPARTS. CURRENTLY THE UNDOCUMENTED YOU QUALIFY FOR EMERGENCY SCOPE RESTRICTED MEDI CAL BUT THAT'S ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES AND ONLY STABILIZE THE PATIENT IT DOESN'T GET PROVIDE ANY PRIMARY CARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES OR EVEN ACCESS -- TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO COUNTY BASED HEALTH CARE PRO STICKY NOTES BUT IN MANY ROAD AREAS THE SICKNESS DO NOT EXIST SO MANY CHOOSE TO GO WITHOUT CARE OR TO SEEK OUT HOME REMEDIES FOR THEIR AILMENTS. NOT HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE -- OFTEN MEANS THAT PREVENTIVE CARE IS OUT OF REACH AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES GO UNTREATED LEVY LEADING TO POUR A HELL ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE ALSO MEANS THAT YOU COULD BE ONE SICKNESS OR MEDICAL ILLNESS AWAY FROM ENOUGH TO CALAMITY DUE TO HIGH MEDICAL COSTS AND MOUNTING MEDICAL DEBT. BUT PASSING YOU BEFORE WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR STATE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT TODAY THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR JUST OF A COUPLE REAL QUICK CLOSING REMARKS. I THINK WE HAVE A BOTH A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND FISCAL IMPERATIVE TO PASS A BEFORE. MAYBE YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU THINK THAT HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE AND IT'S FOR ALL NOT THE FEW OR MAYBE YOU THINK IT'S THE FAIR AND JUST THING TO PROVIDE EVERYBODY WITH HEALTH CARE. EITHER WAY I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE -- TO EVERYONE IN OUR STATE AND THIS IS A BIG STEP TOWARDS DOING THAT WE'RE STATE THAT BELIEVES IN THE US WERE INCLUSIVE -- WE DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST PIECES OR PARTS OF OUR STATE WE BELIEVE IN ALL OF US. RISING TOGETHER. ALSO IT'S IT'S THE FISCALLY PRUDENT AND WISE THING TO DO BECAUSE WITH HEALTH CARE -- FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS IN AMERICA WILL BE ABLE PROVIDE PREVENTION SERVICES EARLY INTERVENTION AND WELLNESS AND NOT WAIT. HAVE TO WAIT TILL SOMEONE GOES TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE WHEN THEY'RE DISEASE HAS -- GOTTEN WORSE AND THEIR ILLNESS MAYBE BEYOND -- HELP SO IT'S FINANCIALLY -- THE RIGHT THING TO DO MORALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I THINK IT REPRESENTS WE ARE AS A STATE.

UP OKAY AS MISTER BLOOM IS NOT HERE IN WHICH CASE IT CAN BE YOU. HI MEGAN HOW MUCH YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB. SEVEN SIXTY FOUR I WANNA BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR TARGETS ARE PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC BY PROHIBITING THE USE OF PROMOTIONAL SUBSIDIES AND MARKETING INCENTIVES DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE CONSUMPTION. OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES DRINKING SODA AND OTHER SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES LIKE SPORTS DRINKS ENERGY DRINKS AND SWEET TEAS. CONTRIBUTE TO A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING DIABETES HEART DISEASE TO THE K.. AND OBESITY. THESE CONDITIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY FELT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES MARKETING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY BIG SO TO LIKE COKE AND PEPSI. MIGHT ARTIFICIALLY DRIVE DOWN PRICES BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THESE TACTICS HURT CONSUMERS AND DRIVE UP HARMFUL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. FOR ALL OF US PROMOTIONS SUCH AS MANUFACTURERS COUPONS ARE ONE KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR EPIDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY MANUFACTURER SUBSIDIES LOWERED THE COST OF SUGARY DRINKS AND OFTEN THESE SUBSIDIES RESULT IN SODA ACTUALLY BEING CHEAPER THAN BOTTLED WATER. AGAIN THIS PUTS GREAT PRESSURE PRESSURE ON POOR FAMILIES MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE HEALTHY. PURCHASING DECISIONS AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR WILL PROHIBIT A SODA COMPANY FROM OFFERING A MANUFACTURER'S COUPON TO THAT PARTNERING MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS OR RETAILERS WE MUST LOOSEN THE GRIP OF BIG SODA. ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES AND INSTEAD PROMOTE HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES AND PURCHASES AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR WILL REDUCE THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND PROMOTE. GREATER HEALTH ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU MEMBERS OF RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR ARE. MORGAN COVER HALL LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND DR ARIANNA. CHIEF DENTAL OFFICER OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET A LOT I SAW IN OAKLAND. THE BILL. PLEASE THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS -- MORGAN CARVALLO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I SEE MAYES BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF BIG SODA COMPANIES THAT TARGET COMMUNITIES TO LOWER THE PRICE FUND HEALTHY PRODUCTS. AND INCREASED CONSUMPTION -- THIS IS A THIS PRODUCT ONLY OR THIS MECHANISM FOR PROMOTIONS ONLY WORKS WHEN THE TARGETED COMMUNITIES ARE MAKING ECONOMIC DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR SELECTIONS AT THE GROCERY STORE. WHEN FAMILIES ARE CHOOSING TO PURCHASE OUT OF BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN THE HEALTHIER OPTIONS? THEY'RE CHOOSING TO DO SO BECAUSE THOSE PROMOTIONS ARE LED BY THE SENATE COMPANIES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT MANUFACTURE DISCOUNTS ARE NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE SODA DISPLAYS PROMOTIONS PAID BY THE COAT SO TO COMPANIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH AT THE SAME TIME THE FOOD STAMPS ARE DISTRIBUTED. UNHEALTHY FOOD BEVERAGES ARE LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS ARE PAYING FOR THOSE LOW PRICES THAT ARE GROCERY STORES. FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THE REAL COST OF THE MANUFACTURE DISCOUNT ISN'T IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE CALORIES THAT ARE BEING CONSUMED AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE STEPS TODAY TO REDUCE THE PERVASIVENESS AND OF OF THESE MANUFACTURER COUPONS AND DISCOUNTS. ON AND HEALTHY SERVICE WITH BEVERAGES I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD THERE BE ANY [inaudible] THANK YOU. DR TRUE RIGHT. SET ON GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS -- DONALD DIRECTOR CHIU DAHLE OFFICER FOR LIKE ANY OTHER ADDRESS I IN EAST OAKLAND -- I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS AND HAVE SINCE SEEN THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SUGARY DRINKS. FIRST HAND FOR EVERYONE OF THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICE OUR CLINIC IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER WILL FULLY INTEGRATED SERVICES MEANING WE TREAT ALL ASPECTS OF PATIENTS HEALTH. NOT JUST THEIR ORAL HEALTH I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE DENTURE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS THAT THESE BEVERAGES HAVE ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF CHILDREN ADULTS. SENIORS INCLUDING DIABETES OBESITY HEART DISEASE AND DENTAL DISEASE AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS -- THESE DISEASES DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND SOCIO ECONOMIC SO WHILE THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS ARE HIT THE MOST IT AFFECTS EVERYONE AT ALL. ALL AT ALL SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE BETWEEN THE LINK BETWEEN OBESITY DIABETES DENTAL DISEASE HEART DISEASE AND THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES SUCH AS SOFT DRINKS ENERGY DRINKS. SWEET TEAS AND SPORTS DRINKS ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT BY THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY OVER TWO POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA DOGS. HAVE BEEN REPORTEDLY DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES REPRESENTING ONE OUT OF TWELVE CALIFORNIANS COMBINED WITH AN ESTIMATED THIRTEEN MILLION ADULTS WHO WHO HAVE PRE DIABETES OR UNDER AYE. DIET AND UNDIAGNOSED DIABETES THESE GROUPS MAKE UP 55% OF OUR POPULATION IN ADULT POPULATION CALIFORNIA. ADULTS WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE ARTHRITIS KIDNEY FAILURE PERIODONTAL DISEASE THAN ADULTS WITHOUT DIABETES. ONE HALF OF ADULTS WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES ALSO HAVE HYPERTENSION. UNFORTUNATELY THESE PREVENTABLE DISEASES ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT IN OUR STATE'S MINORITY COMMUNITIES. LET THE LOS AMERICA AFRICAN AMERICANS NATIVE AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF TYPE TWO DIABETES THE NON HISPANIC WHITES. IF THE TRENDS ARE NOT REVERSED IT IS PREDICTED THAT HALF OF THE LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN BORN INTO A IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND WILL DEVELOP TYPE TWO DIABETES AND THEIR LIFETIME. OUR COMPANIES ARE EXERTING MASSIVE INFLUENCES ON THE CONSUMPTION PATTERNS OF OUR CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO OUR STATE'S HEALTH PROBLEMS AND MASSIVE COSTS TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CDA IN OUR MEMBER DENTISTS HAS SUPPORTED LOCAL TAX INITIATIVES INCLUDING IN MY HOME TOWN OF BERKELEY WHERE WE PASS THIS -- SO TO TAX BY 75%. BUT THE BUT WITH LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO BAND LOCAL SODA INITIATIVES COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA CAN NO LONGER MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS BECAUSE THE LOCAL OF EFFORTS ARE BANNED WE'RE COMING TO YOU WITH ALTERNATIVE POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL CONSUMPTION. OF SUIT. TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES OBESITY DIABETES AND TOOTH DECAY RATES IN CALIFORNIA ART CRISIS LEVELS AND POLICY MAKERS MUST TAKE ACTION. AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR IS JUMPS ONE STEP. BUT IT WILL LIMIT THE MARKETING INFLUENCES OF COKE AND PEPSI ON CALIFORNIA AND HELP BATTLE THE EPIDEMIC WE'RE FACING THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE ANGEL MY PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU GREAT WE DON'T ANYBODY GETTING HURT AND HEALTH COMMITTEE TODAY OKAY. SO. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO WE HAVE OPPOSITION THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATTIMER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND IN OPPOSITION. OUR RETAILERS IN CALIFORNIA DO SELL HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FOODS AND BEVERAGES WE SELL FRIED FOODS AND DELIS CHIPS CANDIES ICE CREAMS AND TO THE OTHER END OF THE OF FOOD SPECTRUM VEGETABLES WHOLE GRAINS DAIRY PRODUCTS WATER TETRA. WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH CHOICES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING. FOR THIS BILL ASSUMES A BECAUSE A MENU FOR MANY BEVERAGE MANUFACTURER OFFERS A RETAILER DISCOUNTED PRICING ON BEVERAGES SO THAT WE CAN PASS THAT DISCOUNT ON OUR CONSUMERS THAT'S HARMFUL PRACTICE WE DISAGREE. THE GROCERY BUSINESS WE HAVE MANUFACTURERS ALL OF OF ALL THE PRODUCTS WE SELL NOT JUST SODAS NOXIOUS SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ALL THE PRODUCTS WE SELL. OR IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR MARGINS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE VALUE PROPOSITION OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT FROM US. THIS BILL DOESN'T APPRECIATE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THE NUMBERS THAT ARE OFTEN CITED AND AND CITED BY THE PROPONENTS TODAY -- DON'T QUITE ADD UP. THE THOUGHT THAT THE SUPER SWEETENED BEVERAGES MUST BE BANNED AS A FORM OF COUPONING BECAUSE THEY ARE THE DRIVER IN THIS OBESITY EPIDEMIC. OBESITY AND DIABETES EPIDEMIC -- DON'T ADD UP UNFORTUNATELY SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES THE CONSUMPTION OF THEM ARE DECLINING INC IN THE UNITED STATES NOT JUST CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES. FOR THE CDC TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CONSUMPTION FROM CALORIES FROM SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES DECLINED BY 26% FOR ADULTS AND 35% FOR YOU. SO AT THE SAME TIME OBESITY PREVALENCE FOR ADULTS INCREASED BY 30% AND YOUTH BY 33% WE'RE NOT HERE IN DENIAL THE FACTOR OF PROBLEMS. WERE SIMPLY COMING IN ARGUING THAT SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ALONE OR NOT THE DRIVER OF THIS. TODAY IN FACT AND THIS IS AGAIN FROM THE RETAILER PERSPECTIVE BY CONSUMERS ARE ZERO OR NO ADDED SUGAR. WITH WATER BEING NOW THE MOST POPULAR BEVERAGE OF THAT CLASS. AGAIN OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES WERE SUCH A PROBLEM THE DISCOUNTS HAD TO BE BANNED THEN WHY AREN'T WE SEEING A REVERSAL ON THESE NUMBERS BECAUSE THE CONSUMPTION IS ALREADY GOING DOWN. I WOULD ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE COUNT LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE THIS BILL DOESN'T SIMPLY BEEN COUPONS SO IF YOU HAVE A PROMOTION IT MAY RUN IN YOUR GROCERY STORE WHERE IT'S BY A CHICKEN. BY A SALAD YOU GET A DISCOUNT ON SOFT DRINK OR SMARTWATER IT'S AFTER THAT BROKE PROGRAM BE GONE AS WELL. GIVE A CLUB OR PROGRAM AND THE MANUFACTURER PARTICIPATES IN THE FINANCES OF THAT WHICH THEY DO AND MANY OF THEM. BY TWO TWELVE PACKS AND GET ONE FREE ON THAT WILL NO LONGER BE AUTHORIZED. THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPACTS TO CONSUMERS AND AGAIN WE WOULD ARGUE THAT CONSUMERS WANT CHOICES AND WE TRY TO PROVIDE THEM FOR THEM IF ANYBODY'S BEEN DOWN THE AISLE IN THEIR SUPERMARKET ANYTIME SOON THEY COULD SEE THERE'S A WHOLE ISLAND. SO DOZEN WATERS AND TEASE SORES AND TEASE IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISLAND WATERS AND JUICES AND OTHER CHOICES AS WELL WE THINK ALL CHOICES OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CONSUMER BENEFIT MEANING A DISCOUNT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HEARING CAREER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRACTION SOME PARKS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING AMUSEMENT PARKS THEME PARKS WATER PARKS AND FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I WANTED OFFER A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S FOCUSING ON THE PROMOTION -- THE NATURE OF THE PROMOTIONS -- MUSE BUT PARKS ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH BEVERAGE -- COMPANIES AND FREQUENTLY THE PROMOTIONS ARE PART OF THAT CONTRACT. AND THE YOU KNOW THE THE PROMOTIONS THAT YOU KNOW WOULD AFFECT THE THEME PARKS ARE THE ONES THAT YOU SEE IN A BRING IN A CAN. AND GET AT A DISCOUNT ON YOUR PARK TICKET. AND THE ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE -- SOMETIMES THE BEVERAGE COMPANY WILL ARRANGE FOR US TO HAVE A PROMOTION WITHIN THE RESTAURANTS. THIS IS A GREAT MARKETING TOOL FOR CALIFORNIANS AMUSEMENT PARKS WHICH ARE A HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE STATE. AND ADDITIONALLY. THERE. THE THE PARKS USE THESE TO OFFSET BUDGETS FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL SEE THE REFRIGERATORS THAT MAY BE BRANDED. BUT THEY GOT THOSE FOR FREE SO IN OFFICE AS AN A BUDGET A BUDGET EXPENSE FOR THE PARKS AND AT WITH THE UMBRELLAS TO YOU'LL SEE THOSE BRANDED. THE USE THIS TO BRING DOWN AT THEIR OPERATING COSTS. AND THE BIGGEST IMPACT THOUGH I THINK IS THAT. THESE KIND OF PROMOTIONS THEY DRIVE ATTENDANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S PARKS. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF VISITORS EVERY YEAR BUT THAT NUMBER IS GREATLY INCREASED BY THESE PROMOTIONS IN THAT TENS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND THEN YOU KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE KIDS WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO A THEME PARK YOU PROBABLY DO LIKE I'VE ALWAYS DONE YOU GO ONLINE AND YOU LOOK FOR DISCOUNTED TICKETS. FREQUENTLY THAT WILL POP UP IN YOUR IN YOUR GOOGLE SEARCH YOU'LL SEE -- I CAN GO GET A CAN OF SODA AND USE THAT FREQUENTLY THE CANS ARE EVEN CONSUMED BUT THEY ARE USED TO GET THAT DISCOUNT AT THE GATE -- SO AGAIN THERE'S A GREAT MARKETING TOOL THAT GETS YOUR PARKS NAMES OUT INTO GROCERY STORES AND IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS. IT IS DRIVES ATTENDANCE AND IT HELPS FAMILIES AFFORD A GREAT DAY OF FUN IN ONE OF MANY CALIFORNIANS THEME PARKS THANK YOU. YOU HAVE LESS THAN A MINUTE SO MISTER CHAIRMAN -- BERMAN ABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN A PATROLMAN CONVENIENCE STORE ASSOCIATION THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS STRONG. I'M GOING TO ECHO WITH JOHN AND THE OTHER LADY SAID LADY MENTIONED THAT THE RESTRICTIONS PROPOSED IN THIS LEGISLATION KIND OF A RAISES SOME REALLY. SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND THE PUBLIC POTENTIAL -- COMMERCIAL FREE SPEECH UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT -- FOR THE MORE THE LEGISLATION INTERFERES WITH. THE OPERATIONS OF CALIFORNIA VENDORS AND OUR RETAILERS -- IN A MANNER THAT UP PLACES BOTH -- BRICKS AND MORTAR BUSINESSES IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IS OUT WITH THEIR ONLINE COMPETITORS [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. AND JUST YOUR NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. CAVENDER CHECK KARA A PCA PRESIDENT SACRAMENTO I OPPOSE THIS. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS SUMMER GAETA SMALLEY I'M OF LOCAL -- SACRAMENTO BUSINESS OWNER AND A WHOLESALER I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE CHAU. I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND BEHALF OF OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES IN SACRAMENTO CITY ICE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL LET THE ADULT PEOPLE CHOOSE THE RIGHT. TO DRINK OR EAT THANK YOU JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. HELLO NURSE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. GREG HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE CAN MANUFACTURES INSTITUTE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THROW COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY SO SHE XIN ALSO OPPOSED A BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD APPLY. TO A TWELVE OUNCE TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT. GRADUATION OR MORE. GOOD AFTERNOON JUDY IS THE CALIFORNIA FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WINGER ON THE OTHER CALIFORNIA FUELS AND CONVENIENCE ALLIANCE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITHOUT GOOD THANK YOU. DRUG RIGHT POLICY MANNER MANAGER LA COUNTY BUSINESS FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION. ROBERT DOWNEY WITH CALIFORNIA AUTOMATIC MANY COUNCIL IN pOPPOSITION. NOT CERTAIN OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. LO THESE RUMORS WITH THE ORGANIZING LEADERSHIP ACADEMY AND I APOLOGIZE WE MISTER QUEUE BUT I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL OKAY. HI MY NAME IS JASMINE I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. MY NAME IS ISAAC TYSON AND I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL I ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL. CHRISTIAN GARCIA WITH THE ORGANIZING LEADERSHIP AND CAT ANY IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS POINT. ANYBODY ELSE'S SUPPORT FOR ANYBODY ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IT'S AN OPEN MIKE [inaudible] JUST KIDDING. AND WE DON'T DO KARAOKE SO -- WITH THAT I WOULD -- NO MORE WITH NO MORE SPEAKERS WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR BIGELOW. YEAH. MR BONTA COULD COULD YOU. AS YOU VISION YOUR BILL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT'S ALLOWED WHAT'S NOT ALLOWED HOW USE ENVISIONED THE MARKETING. ASPECT OF THIS -- BUILD MOVING FORWARD AND THE IMPACTS. CAN YOU MAYBE HIT ON THOSE POINTS [inaudible] YES. SO THE IDEA IS TO PREVENT A BIG A COMMON PRACTICE THAT I BELIEVE IS MANIPULATE THE MARKET AND IN HIS PREDATORY. FROM CONTINUING TO TAKE PLACE WITH RESPECT TO SUGARY BEVERAGES. IF SOMEONE WISHES [inaudible] TO VIED. PRICE SUBSIDIES REFORM OF COUPONS -- OR OTHER AB FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR WATER. FOR HEALTHY BEVERAGES THEY MAY OUR BILL DOES NOT PREVENT THAT. BUT IT DOES GO AFTER NOT THE EXCLUSIVE DRIVER BUT A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. TO AN EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE FACING A PUBLIC HEALTH. I WITH RESPECT TO DIABETES AND AND HEART DISEASE AND TOOTH DECAY AND OBESITY AND THAT IS SUGARY BEVERAGES WE KNOW OF FROM THE CDC THAT FORTY SEVEN POINT SERVICE WITH BEVERAGES. CONSUMPTION MAY BE DECLINING -- IN SOME FORMS -- BUT THAT NUMBER IS WAY TOO HIGH AND WE KNOW FROM THE STATS -- THAT THE RESTORE PUBLIC HEALTH SO THE FOCUS IS ON SUGARY BEVERAGES IT'S NOT ON BRANDING OF OF PRODUCTS -- IT'S IT'S THE MANUFACTURER'S COUPONS AND THAT ARE PROVIDED TO DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS. TO REDUCE THE PRICE IN WHAT ARE IDENTIFIED. BY THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES AS UNDER PERFORMING MARKETS MARKETS THAT AREN'T. DRINKING ENOUGH FOR THEIR SODA OF THE SUGARY BEVERAGE. AND WE ARE WE KNOW THAT WOULD YES BUT THE OUTCOME WHAT I THINK THE OUTCOME IS. CONSUMERS ARE HIGHLY PRICE SENSITIVE WHEN IT COMES TO SUGARY BEVERAGES THIS IS THE THE THE DATA SHOWS THAT IT'S HIGHLY ELASTIC THAT WHEN PRICES -- GO DOWN CONSUMPTION GOES UP. WHEN PRICES GO UP [inaudible] CONSUMPTION -- GOES DOWN. SO WE EXPECT THERE TO BE LESS CONSUMPTION [inaudible] OF A ONE DRIVER OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH THAT CAN -- EPIDEMIC AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING -- AND IF IT. IF IF BUT THE OPPOSITION SAYS IS TRUE ABOUT. SOME OF THE CONSUMPTION GOING DOWN AND THIS BILL HAVE TO GO DOWN FURTHER. GOOD WE LIKE THAT OUTCOME THAT'S THE DESIRED OUTCOME. SO IT IT SEEKS TO END DATE -- MANIPULATIVE MARKETING PRACTICE -- IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. STE SO JUST JUST AS ONE READING THROUGH THAT -- MAYBE I MISSED THE PART BUT I THOUGHT IT JUST KIND OF RELATED TO ALL PRODUCTS PROVIDED SO I WANT TO BE GOOD. I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION OF OF MAYBE THE OPPOSITION OR THE FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. DO YOU READ IT THE SAME WAY DOES IT ANCHOR ALL PRODUCTS OR IS IT LIMITED TO JUST SUGAR. PRODUCT IF YOU KNOW WE READ THE BILL AS ALL SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES -- THE DEFINITION OF WHICH IS FROM FROM OUR REDEFINITION WHICH IS ANYTHING OVER TWENTY CALORIES WOULD BE CONSIDERED SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE AND THEREFORE A COUPON OR ANY KIND OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY GET NOT JUST COUPON WOULD BE PERHAPS [inaudible] OKAY SO. SO IS ACTUALLY IN YOUR MIND IN YOUR MIND ELIMINATES EVERYTHING. YEAH EVERY SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE POSSIBILITY FOR ANY KIND OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY YES. AND HOW WILL THAT BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE HOW DETRIMENTAL WOULD THAT BE FOR OUR DESTINATIONS MR ARE. THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW AND I'VE RECEIVED REPORTS FROM SEVERAL OF OUR PARKS THAT THEY TRACK THE PROMOTIONS AND ON ANY GIVEN DAY THAT THERE ARE PROMOTIONS AND AFFECTED CAN INCREASE -- ATTENDANCE BY ABOUT A THOUSAND OR SO -- SO THIS WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE ATTENDANCE AT THE GATES [inaudible] OKAY. WELL AGAIN I'LL JUST GO BACK INTO CHAIR. MY READING WAS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUES OF TWELVE OUNCES -- WITH TWELVE OR TWENTY CALORIES OR MORE. THAT'S QUALIFIED AS A LOW -- CAL BEVERAGE COUNTY YOU KNOW CALORIE BEVERAGE. SO I'M I'M THINKING THIS IS GONNA. INCLUDE EVERYTHING AND IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY. PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR US TO TO MANAGE OR FOR ANY. INSTITUTION IS TRYING TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS ANYWAY I'M NOT SURE I QUITE GET THERE WITH YOU TODAY MISTER BOND. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU THANK MISTER BIGELOW OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE. SHARES ROSE CLARIFICATION ON THE EXCLUDE SOME PART OF THE DEFINITION OF SS BE. I'M IN ONE OF THOSE OR IS IT TALKS ABOUT THE EXCLUSION BEING BOTTLED SS BE SYRUP SOME POWDER SO TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. AND AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IS THAT CLEAR TO SAY THAT EXCLUDES THAT FROM BEING PART OF THIS [inaudible] THAT'S CLEAR. THAT'S RIGHT THE BILL YES. SO IF I'M READING THAT READ EXCLUDING THEM ALLOWS FOR THE SALE TO CONTINUE. YES THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CNN WILL BRING BACK TO THE AUTHOR WHICH LIKE CLOSE. YES I I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL I I ALSO APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM THE OPPOSITION -- GIVEN% THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA -- I I DO WATCH ONE IS A QUICK POINT ABOUT OUR OUR MISSION PARKS. IT YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT ARE MUSEUM PARKS -- WILL ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL OR IF YOU HAVE A RANGE OF WHERE YOU DRINK A SODA YOU GO TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK. I I THINK I'M USING PARKS A MUCH MORE THAN THAT I THINK PEOPLE GO BECAUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID THEY GO WITH THE FAMILY I TAKE MY FAMILY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA ENJOY THAT AS PART OF WHO WE ARE AND AND AND PART. OF OUR OUR SOCIAL EXPERIENCE SO -- I DON'T THINK THEY NEED. TO BE PART OF WHAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC BY ALL MEASURES. IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK THEY'LL BE SUCCESSFUL WITH WITHOUT -- THAT PRACTICE AND SO THIS THIS REALLY TARGETS ONE SPECIFIC PRACTICE WHICH I BELIEVE IS PREDATORY WHICH IS MANIPULATIVE -- WHICH TARGETS PHONE OF A POPULATIONS AND ADDS TO AN ALREADY UNACCEPTABLE EPIDEMIC AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO HELP ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS. I HAVE I I WOULD DO OKAY THANK YOU HAVE YOU DO OKAY.

SO MISTER BLOOM WILL BE PRESENTING A. B. ONE THIRTY EIGHT MR BLOOM [inaudible] SHARE [inaudible] THIS. THE SCIENCES IS OVERWHELMING CALIFORNIA IS FACING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND RATES OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OBESITY HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. TODAY NEARLY THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE DIABETIC. MILLIONS MORE WILL BECOME DIABETIC. THESE HEALTH IMPACTS ARE FELT HARDEST IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH BLACK LATINO AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING DIABETES AT RATES TWICE AS HIGH. AS THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THE HUMAN TOLL OF THIS HEALTH CRISIS IS AMOUNTS. KIDNEY FAILURE HIGH AMPUTATION RATES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS NO SMALL MATTER. DIABETES ALONE COST THE STATE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN DIRECT MEDICAL EXPENSES AND IS DRIVING UP SYSTEM WIDE HEALTH CARE COSTS. PATIENTS WITH DIABETES ACCOUNT FOR ONE IN THREE HOSPITALIZATIONS. ONE IN. THREE THESE COSTS ARE BORNE BY OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND BY THE STATE THROUGH INCREASED SPENDING ON MEDICARE ALL. AS DAUNTING AS THE HEALTH CRISIS IS TODAY WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO ACT ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] AND AGAIN. LET ME REPEAT THE SCIENCES OVERWHELMING. SUGARY DRINKS HAVE PLAYED A UNIQUE ROLE IN DRIVING THE HEALTH EPIDEMIC THAT WE FACE TODAY. THEY ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGAR IN THE AMERICAN DIET. AND LEAD TO INCREASED RISK OF DIABETES HEART DISEASE LIVER DISEASE OBESITY TOOTH DECAY. AND EVEN SOME CANCERS. AND NO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CALORIES SUGARY DRINKS ARE UNIQUELY ON HEALTHY. THEY ARE EMPTY CALORIES THAT ARE METABOLIZED QUICKLY IN A WAY THAT CAN OVERWHELM THE PANCREAS AND LEAD TO THE KIND OF WEIGHT GAIN THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. AS WELL AS PROSTATE AND BREAST CANCER. ABOUT HALF OF ADULTS IN TWO THIRDS OF YOUTH CONSUMER SUGARY DRINK. EVERY DAY. ON AVERAGE CHILDREN CONSUME OVER THIRTY GALLONS OF SUGARY DRINKS EVERY YEAR THAT'S ENOUGH TO FILL A BATH TUB. AND SO HERE WE ARE WITH THE HEALTH CRISIS. AND LITTLE TO NO PREVENTION FUNDING. AND WITH THE PRODUCT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS. TRULY. A UNIQUE AND THAT'S WHERE. MY BILL COMES IN AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT PROPOSES TO LEVY A TWO CENT PER OUNCE. UGH UGH THAT FLUID OUNCE. TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS THE REVENUE OF WHICH WOULD BE USED TO CONFRONT THESE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS HAD ON THROUGH PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARSH HARDEST HIT BY THE DIABETES. AND OBESITY EPIDEMICS. THIS PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO DO TWO THINGS FIRST REDUCE CONSUMPTION ANDSECOND. RAISE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO EDUCATE AND EMPOWER CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES A GOAL I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THIS BILL HOLDS IMMENSE POTENTIAL TO COUNTERACT THE ALARMING HEALTH TRENDS THAT WE'VE WITNESS. CITIES AROUND THE U. S. AND COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ALREADY PASSED THEIR OWN SUGARY DRINK TAXES WHO WOULDN'T BE FIRST IN THIS. AND THEY'VE SEEN POSITIVE RESULTS NEARBY A FEE BY A FEE AND BERKELEY REDUCE CONSUMPTION BY ALMOST 10% OVERALL. AND 21% IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND THAT'S JUST WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. CONSUMPTION OF TAP AND BOTTLED WATER INCREASED BY AN ESTIMATED IN MEXICO A SUGARY DRINK TAX REDUCE PURCHASES OF THESE -- BY FIVE POINT 5% IN THE FIRST YEAR AND NINE POINT 7% IN THE SECOND YEAR. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING CONSUMPTION. REVENUES WERE HELP FUND IMPORTANT PREVENTION PROGRAMS. EVERYTHING FROM SCHOOL NURSES TO NUTRITION EDUCATION TO PHYSICAL EDUCATION. AND ACCESS TO SAFE. AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON LANGUAGE REGARDING EXACTLY THAT TOPIC AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FUNDS ARE DEDICATED TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS PILOT PROGRAM. WHICH WILL HELP CONFERENCE RECIPIENTS AFFORDABLY ACCESS DRINKING WATER [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S INACTION ON THE SEWERS ISSUE IS NO LONGER EXCUSABLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN NO LONGER PASSED THEIR OWN ORDINANCES. A POLICY THAT THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY FOUGHT. FOR AND AS YOU ALL REMEMBER STRONG ARMED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST SESSION. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. THE FIRST IS THAT SIN TAXES DON'T ACTUALLY CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND WE KNOW THAT THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY FALSE. WE HAVE DECADES OF EVIDENCE FROM TOBACCO TAXES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AT REDUCING TOBACCO USE AND IMPROVING HEALTH OUT OUTCOMES. AS I AS I MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE IT OF EVIDENCE FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE PASSED THEIR OWN SUGARY DRINK TAXES. AND I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION IS ONLY PART OF THE BILL'S GOAL THE SECOND LONG TERM GOAL. WHICH IS EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT IS TO CREATE A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION IS THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT ACTUALLY HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. AS MUCH AS WE LOVE INSTANT GRATIFICATION TRANSFORMING HEALTH OUTCOMES DOES TAKE TIME. AND WE KNOW THAT SUGARY DRINK TAXES REDUCE CONSUMPTION AND WE ALSO HAVE A LITANY OF HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ARE EFFECTIVE. IF WE COULD JUST FUND THE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE TOBACCO TAX EXAMPLE THAT HAS OVER TIME DEMONSTRABLY AFFECTED THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS OF AMERICANS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE BETTER. THE COALITION OPPOSE LETTER IN ARGUING IT'S POINTS LINKS TO THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE. A THINK TANK KNOWN FOR ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH PHILIP MORRIS TO UNDERMINE TOBACCO TAXES. AND AS WELL IT'S CLIMATE DENIAL RESEARCH. BACKING FOR THE COALITION'S CLAIMS ALSO COMES FROM RESEARCHERS AT THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND HEALTH WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY FUNDED SCIENCE GROUP. THAT ADVOCATES AGAINST CHEMICAL AND HEALTH REGULATIONS AMONG OTHER THINGS. FINALLY THOUGH THE INDUSTRY ARGUES THAT THE COULD BE JOBS AND ECONOMIC IMPACT -- NUMEROUS STUDIES FROM BERKELEY AND FROM PHILADELPHIA HAVE SHOWN THAT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE A ARE IMMENSE COSTS TO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF WE LEAVE THIS CRISIS UNCHECKED. AND THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE THAT WE ALL KNOW WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE DISEASES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED. THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PRICE TAG AND YET. WE CAN EXPECT IMPROVEMENTS IF WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS INITIATIVE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN STUDY AFTER STUDY THAT CONFIRMS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SUGARY DRINKS AND I'D BE THIS. THE SCIENCE IS QUITE CLEAR. WE'VE WITNESSED LANCS THE INDUSTRY WILL GO TO TO PROFIT CONSUMERS EXPENSE MUCH LIKE BIG TOBACCO DID INCLUDING MISLEADING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TARGETING CHILDREN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SUPPORT HAS GROWN IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WHICH IS COPIOUS. AND THE RESULTS FROM OTHER SUGARY DRINK DRINK TAXES. IT IS NOW TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND DO ITS PART. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE JASMINE TORONTO A STUDENT FROM STOCKTON AND MONICA MATOS A PEDIATRICIAN TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. ADDITIONALLY WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE LAURA PALMER AND CAN AFFECT TO RESEARCHERS WITH THE NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE. WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON THE SCIENCE OF SUGARY DRINKS? AND THE IMPACT OF SUGARY DRINK TAXES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BLOOM QUIT WITH YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NUMBER NINE NAME IS DOCTOR MONICA MATHIS AND I AM A PEDIATRICIAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS OVER FIVE THOUSAND BOARD CERTIFIED PEDIATRICIANS I APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AS PEDIATRICIANS EVERY DAY MY COLLEAGUES AND I SEE CHILDREN HARMED BY SUGARY DRINKS FROM THE TEAM THAT'S DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE TWO DIABETES TO THE TODDLER RT SHOWING SIGNS OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE. A DIFFICULT CHILD IS MENTIONED CONSUMES OVER THIRTY GALLONS OF SUGARY DRINKS EVERY YEAR CURRENT DIETARY GUIDELINES RECOMMEND THAT CHILDREN AND TEENS CONSUME FEWER THAN 10% OF CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGARS. BUT DATA SHOWS THAT THE NOW CONSUME NEARLY DOUBLE THAT RECOMMENDED LET ME AND MORE THAN HALF OF IT COMING FROM SUGARY DRINKS. WHILE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES IN CREATING A HEALTHY HOME ENVIRONMENT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH AND WE'VE SEEN THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY APPROACHES WERE NECESSARY TO CURB TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL USE AND WE NEED SIMILAR INITIATIVES TO REDUCE SUGARY TRIP AND DRINK CONSUMPTION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. AS TOBACCO TAXES INCREASED IT'S A GREAT USED DROP PRECIPITOUSLY ALCOHOL TAXES REDUCE EXCESS ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ALCOHOL ASSOCIATE MOTOR VEHICLE AND EXCISE TAXES ON SUGARY DRINKS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED CONSUMPTION IN CITIES LIKE BERKELEY AND SAN FRANCISCO. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT SUGARY DRINK WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO LOWER RATES OF CHILD THROUGH THE CITY LEADING TO PREVENTION OF OBESITY IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN. AND A TEN YEAR NATION MY SAVINGS OF THIRTY ONE DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT. OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT THE TAXES CAN BE REGRESSIVE AS LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS BEAR GREATER BURDEN FROM THE TAX. HOWEVER WHEN THAT WHEN THE MONIES RAISED PAY FOR PROGRAMS THAT WILL REDUCE HEALTH INEQUITIES THE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY THE TAX ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES WHO BENEFIT MOST FROM BOTH AN ECONOMIC IN HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HAVE TOTALLY INDOORS SUGARY TAXES LIKE THE ONE IN AB. ONE THIRTY EIGHT TO REDUCE EXCESS SUGAR CONSUMPTION IMPROVE HEALTH AND SAVE LIVES EVERY CHILD DESERVES TO GROW UP HEALTHY I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. SEE NO -- ONE OPPOSITION PLEASE COME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NUMBERS. SAID RICK MCGEE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THIS AFTERNOON. FIRST OF ALL WHEN A POINT OUT THAT WE MAKE THESE LABELS ABOUT SUGARY SWEET BEVERAGES BUT THE DEFINITIONS KEEP ROTATING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. THIS YEAR -- AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT HAS A DEFINITION LEVEL FOR SERVICE WE BEVERAGE AT TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE CALORIES IN A TWELVE OUNCE SERVING. DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST WHICH WAS AT SEVENTY FIVE CALORIES HUGE DIFFERENCE OUR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER SEVERAL YEARS. TO TRY TO HAVE MORE INCREASE LOW AND NO CALORIE BEVERAGES -- THERE'S A TYPICAL SO TO WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CALORIES THIS NOW WITH CAPTURE SAY ITS HEAT THAT HAS FIFTY CALORIES IN IT AND NOW WOULD BE TAX ON IT SO WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE PEOPLE. TO THOSE HEALTHIER OPTIONS HOPEFULLY DOWN TO A ZERO OPTION -- THAT IS NOW TAX -- OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN LOWER NO CALORIE BEVERAGES WHAT ARE STILL SAY THAT 50% OF WHAT SOLD UP OUR PRODUCT OUR ZERO CALORIE PRODUCTS. I'M SO THIS WOULD CAPTURING IT -- MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE OF TESTIMONY ON THE EARLIER BILL IS THAT CONSUMPTION IS DOWN 2526% IN ADULTS THIRTY FIVE POINT 9% IN USE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THE OBESITY RATES HAVE GONE UP THIRTY AND SO OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE US DOUBT -- CALORIES DIET HAS GONE UP FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE CALORIES SO THE AVERAGE PERSON IS CONSUMING MORE THAN. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE CALORIES MORE PER DAY THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST. MOST OF THAT 38% IS NOT -- IS COMING FROM STARCHESSOLD MOST OF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES A WE ARE CONSUMING IT IS NOT JUST CIGARETTES START IN FACT AS WELL SO WE ARE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES THAT WE ARE CONSUMING. EVERY DAY EVERYONE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT BERKELEY AS A SUCCESS RATE. AND BERKELEY DID PASS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS IS THAT BERKELEY WHEN THE THE COLLEAGUES ONLY DID -- THE STUDY THEMSELVES IN BERKELEY THEY INDICATED THAT -- THE CALORIE CONSUMPTION FROM SODAS WENT DOWN -- SIX CALORIES PER DAY WHICH DOESN'T EVEN INDICATING ANY KIND OF WEIGHT LOSS BUT THEY STARTED DRINKING SMOOTHIES AND SO THEIR CALORIE COUNT WENT UP THIRTY TWO CALORIES A DAY. AND SO BERKELEY ALSO SAYS -- WE'VE HAD THIS DECREASE BUT THERE THERE ARE AMOUNT OF REVENUE HAS BEGUN INCREASING AND BERKELEY SO IT THAT'S ON BERKELEY'S WEBSITE SO IT CAN'T BE GOING DOWN AND YOUR REVENUES ARE CONTINUING TO GO UP. THERE WAS JUST A GATE STUDY BAD WAS FUNDED NOT BY OUR INDUSTRY BUT THE GATES FAMILY THAT WAS A TWENTY SEVEN YEARS WORLD WIDE STUDY OF WHAT WE'RE CONSUMING. AND THEY THOUGHT THAT SUGARY DRINKS WOULD BE ON THE TOP OF THAT LIST UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T EATING HEALTHIER PRODUCTS SO WE ACCESS TO FRESH FRUITS. FRESH VEGETABLES AND THE EXAMPLES WERE NOT JUST THE US BUT ALSO IN MEXICO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AT THOSE WERE THE FACTORS. I'VE BEEN GIVEN TIME GO AHEAD LET MY PROBABLY FINISHED. I GOTTA TALK FASTER. THIS GERMAN MEMBERS -- JOHN MY RUN HAVE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION -- FIRST OF ALL ARM OUR MEMBERS ARE OPPOSED -- TO PRODUCT SPECIFIC TARGETED TAXES AGAIN WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHY WE WANT OUR ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS. TO BE ABLE HAVE CHOICES AND WE DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAX THOSE CHOICES -- WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH A RANGE OF OPTIONS AND LET THEM MAKE WHAT BUT HOPEFULLY IS THE BEST OPTION FOR THEM -- I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO DATA POINT THAT GETS TRANSPOSED AWFUL LOT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE MAY. OFFERED BY THE PROPONENTS AND THE AUTHOR THAT THAT ADDED SUGARS THAT SOFT DRINKS SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE THE FOREIGN AWAY THE MAJORITY OF THE CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGARS IN OUR DIET. AND WHILE I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THE CDC NUMBERS TO TELL US THE MOST RECENT ONES THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGARS IN OUR DIE. FROM ALL BEVERAGES THAT ARE SUGAR SWEETENED OR ABOUT 48% OF THOSE CALORIES. WHAT'S NOT CLEAR HOWEVER WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR HEREIS THAT THE CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGAR IN OUR DIET OR LESS THAN 6% OF THE CALORIES IN OUR DIET. SO IT ISN'T THAT THE NUMBER OF CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGAR THAT'S COMING FROM SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES YES IT'S IT'S THE LARGEST. LARGEST PERCENTAGE NOT THE MAJORITY TO LARGEST PERCENTAGE BUT AS OF THE CALORIES OF ADDED SUGAR AS AS MS -- AS FREDERICK WAS SAYING A MOMENT AGO. THE CALORIES THAT ARE DRIVING THE CONSUMPTION PATTERN IN THE AMERICAN DIET IN PARTICULAR ARE NOT FROM BEVERAGES THERE FROM MANY OTHER FOOD SOURCES INCLUDING DAIRY PRODUCTS OVER GRAIN PRODUCTS. BEEF PRODUCTS ETCETERA ETCETERA SO BUT IT'S AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT PROPER THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE DATA HERE -- FINAL FINAL POINT AGAIN WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY OPPOSED THESE MEASURES -- THE ONE THING THAT WE WOULDN'T DISPUTE -- THAT -- A SOMEONE BLOOM SAID THERE IS A CLEAR CAN'T BE IMPACTS CERTAINLY ON OUR CONSUMERS AND IT MAY CHOOSE THEM TO SWITCH. BUT BUT THE INDUSTRY AND RETAILERS HAVE GONE ON THEIR OWN TO AGGRESSIVELY PUT MEANT MULTIPLE OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE FOR FOLKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE LESS ARGUMENT JESUS CHRIST I FOLLOW THE TO HARD ACT TO FOLLOW HERE -- BERMAN NOBLE VIA ON BEHALF OF AFTER THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM AND CONVENIENCE STORE ASSOCIATION -- WILL ECHOING WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID WERE OVER POSTED AB -- ONE THIRTY EIGHT ONE THE BEHAVIOR DOESN'T CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS -- POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A TWO DAUGHTERS AT BOTH GRADUATED FROM BERKELEY HAVE A HIGHEST DEEPER BERKELEY BUT THAT'S INCONCLUSIVE.

UP FIRST I I'D LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM I HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE PAIN ON THIS BILL MORE THAN ONCE AND YOU HAVE TOLERATED -- NOT JUST MY ARGUMENTS BUT TAKING THEM INTO CONSIDERATION THIS TIME WHICH I TRULY APPRECIATE -- CLEARLY THE THESE ARE THE KIND OF TAXES THAT AFFECTS MY COMMUNITY TREMENDOUSLY AND THE IDEA THAT ANY PROGRAM THAT CAME OUT OF THIS. DIDN'T ALLOW FOR WATER TO BE CHEAPER OR FREE WAS A REAL ISSUE FOR ME AND HAS KEPT ME OFF THIS BILL AS A PERSON WHOSE FATHER SUFFERS FOR DIED FROM DIABETES. I THINK THE FIRST TIME YOU BROUGHT THIS TO MY DAD WAS IN THE HOSPITAL SUFFERING FROM ISSUES OF DIABETES AND I STILL VOTED NO. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY MY DAD HAS THE MONEY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY. HOWEVER THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT TO DON'T. AND UNTIL WE PROVIDE AN OPTION THAT IS EITHER FOR YOU OR AT THE SAME PRICE AND SO THAT FOR ME I COULD NEVER GET THERE AND SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. I HAVE LIKE I SAID I HAVE ANNOYED HELLO TO YOU. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO FINALLY COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT WILL WILL POTENTIALLY GIVE. PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WATER AT THE SAME PRICE AS SODA. THAT MEANS A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE I LIVE. AND SO I KNOW IT'S BEEN ROUGH BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY AND I THINK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR. FIRST I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THIS PRESENTATION OF THE PRIOR ONE BUT EITHER ONE IT'S IT'S A SIMILAR ISSUE MR BLOOM. THERE'S BEEN SOME -- ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED. BADGES BEVERAGES HAVE HAS GONE DOWN WHEN AND IF YOU ARE ANY OF YOUR WITNESSES KIDA COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE YEAH I I THINK -- IT'S A TECHNICAL QUESTION BEST ANSWERED BY THEM BUT IT SHOULD BE SELF EVIDENT THAT CONSUMPTION IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES PLACE TODAY THE D. DISEASE PROCESS PROCEEDS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO WHEN WE'RE STUDYING THESE THINGS WE'RE GONNA. NOTICE CONSUMPTION GOING DOWN IN THE NEAR TERM AND THE GOOD HEALTH RESULTS IN THE MORE AND IN THE LONGER TERM BUT BEYOND THAT ALL TURN TO THE EXPERTS. BERNIE TUITION POLICY INSTITUTE AND OTHER SAD CONSERVING HAS GONE DOWN BUT IT REMAINS HIGH SO HALF OF ADULTS CONSUMERS AGREE DRINK ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND MORE THAN 60% OF CHILDREN. SO THE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN BUT THEY'RE STILL UBIQUITOUSLY CONSUME TEACHER. WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME I COULDN'T TELL I DO NOT THAT'S CORRECT CDC I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME TO RESPOND OR NOT. THAT YES THOSE NUMBERS THAT I ARTICULATED OR FROM THE CDC YET THAT AND THEN I WILL ALSO ADD THAT I'M IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT WHEN WE TOOK SODAS OUT OF SCHOOLS CHILDHOOD OBESITY RATES -- PREVALENCE RATHER AND DECREASED AN OVERWEIGHT RATES HAVE DECREASED AS WELL SO THE LOCUS OF AND OF EFFORT HAS BEEN ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION AND THAT IS THE AREA OF THE POPULATION WHICH WE HAVE SEE AN APPLIED TELLING ABOUT THE CITY RATES. Q.. AND THIS. WAS IN ANSWER I THINK MR HACKED -- WITH. LOCAL RESIDENTS. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE OKAY OKAY AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS -- I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER BY NEED MAYBE YOU CAN HELP AND LIGHTNESS THAT. NO THERE'S ARGUMENTS IT'S NOT YES SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES LIKE A TV TO THE CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE INSANE INCREASE IN -- IN CALORIES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND OF COURSE THE THE OBESITY RATE. AND THAT FOLKS WOULD SAY WHY DON'T YOU DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CHOCOLATE CAKE HEARD SNICKERS BARS OR CHEESE BURGERS AND I I THINK YOUR YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT. SODA ARE ARE EMPTY CALORIES UNLIKE A POTENTIAL SMOOTHLY WHICH HAS SOME VALUE IN NUTRITION A SODA FOR SERVICE WE MEMBERS ARE EMPTY CALORIES IS THAT WHAT THEY ARE WE I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO GET LOST IN THE DISCUSSION OF OF OF CALORIES -- THE A SIMPLE FACT ABOUT SUGARY BEVERAGES IS THAT LIQUID SUGAR IS METABOLIZED DIFFERENTLY AND IN THE IN THE BODY -- IT TO A IS PROCESS BY THE PANCREAS AND IS DEPOSITED IN THE BODY IS FAT -- IN VERY RAPID FASHION SO THE MORE LIQUID SUGAR ONE CONSUMES THE MORE LIKELY ONE AS TO BECOME OBESE OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. OKAY AND THEN JUST JUST A FEW POINTS I WANT. TO TOUCH ON AS YOU NOTED. THESE POLICIES WORK WHEN THESE POLICIES STARTED IN MEXICO THE OPPOSITION SAID. WELL THAT'S MEXICO IS DIFFERENT THERE. WE'VE SEEN HIM NOW IN CALIFORNIA IN RICHMOND IN SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKLEY NOW IN PHILADELPHIA. WE KNOW THAT THESE POLICIES WORK TO DECREASE CONSUMPTION. AND MAKE COMMUNITIES A HEALTHIER AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC AND THE NUMBERS ARE JUST. MIND LINE. NO THE FACT THAT THE THE OBESITY RATE FOR KIDS HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR THIS GENERATIONS WALLING BACK AND FORTH IS WAS PROJECTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH THE FIRST IN CENTURIES HAVE A LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN YOUR PARENTS BUT THEY MAY NOT BE THAT. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT STILL THE OVERALL LIFE EXPECTANCY RATES ARE GOING DOWN. AND YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE REGRESSIVE NOUS BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL SAY THIS IS. REGRESSIVETO POOR PEOPLE. TO BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REGRESSIVE TO BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES. TIED TO TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OBESITY THAT IS A PROVEN FACT THE NUMBER OF KIDS WHO ARE ON THE ONE WAY TRAIN TO TYPE TWO DIABETES FOR KEEPING IS THE COLOR OVER 50%. AND THE THE LAST THING AND AND I'VE HAD THIS IN MY DESK FOR TEN YEARS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER BUT IT SHOCKING. TO BELIEVE THAT THIS. THE AVERAGE TEENAGER. IN AMERICA AND CALIFORNIA. DRINKS AND A SODA TO HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED TEASPOONS. OF SUGAR AND YOU POURED. TEASPOON AFTER TEASPOON AFTER TO SPUR THE AVERAGE TEENAGER AGAIN. CONSUMES THIS. ON A WEEKLY BASIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND THAT CANNOT BE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH ESPECIALLY WITH EMPTY -- CALORIE ENTITY LIKE A SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE -- THIS IS A SOUND PUBLIC POLICY IT'S NOT MANY GOVERNMENTS. WE KNOW THAT THIS COST US DEARLY IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS WE KNOW THESE MONIES WILL GO TO PREVENTION AND HEALTH CARE AND MAKE OUR MAKE OUR STATE TO HEALTHIER AND FRANK TO LIVE LONGER SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR PUSHING THIS FOR MEASURE FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE SECULAR KERR. A MISTER BLOOM I WANT TO THANK YOU FIRST FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET ME ONE ON ONE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME. CONCERNS ON THE IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL NEW TAX -- BUT I WILL VOTE FOR YOU TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORKING OUT THE DETAILS. MY VOTE TODAY REPRESENTS. THE SUPPORT OF FOR PUBLIC FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. AFTER ALL WE ARE IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- BEFORE I VOTE AGAIN I WILL REASSESS MY POSITION BASED ON WHERE YOU GO FROM HERE ESPECIALLY RELATE TO THE REVENUES AND HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMMITTED [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MR MAKES. WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT THE THAT THIS WILL BE COLLECTED ANNUALLY WHAT'S YOUR THE ESTIMATE IS -- BETWEEN TWO AND THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH THAT THAT MONEY WILL JUST GO TO THE GENERAL FUND WILL IT BE -- USED FOR DINNER -- GRAMS NO IT IS KEPT IN A A DISCREET FUND -- IT DOES HAVE A UP -- AS I THINK ONE OF THE THE THE A CTA A SPEAKER OBSERVE DAY UP -- PROP NINETY EIGHT TO IMPACT WILL NEED TO CLARIFY OUR LANGUAGE OFF ON THAT -- BECAUSE OF THE TAX SO -- TWO POINT THREE TWO TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS NOT ULTIMATELY THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE -- TO SPEND. AND THAT MONEY WILL THEN BE DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO AN EXPENDITURE PLAN WHICH IN THE PRIOR ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL WE SPELLED OUT VERY CAREFULLY COMING INTO COMMITTEE -- IN THIS. INSTANCE WE DECIDED TO WAIT AND HEAR FROM MEMBERS WHAT THEY FELT THE PRIORITIES ON THE BILL OUGHT TO BE -- I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO VIRTUALLY EVERYONE THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT THE MONEY WILL BE PREDOMINATELY USED FOR PREVENTION EFFORTS -- THAT MEANS IN ADDITION -- TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER IT MEANS SO THINGS LIKE -- SCHOOL NURSES -- A SCHOOL NURSE PROGRAMS IT MEANS COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS WHERE -- FARM WORKER PROGRAMS WHERE GOOD HEALTH -- CAN BE TAUGHT AND THE I THINK THAT IT IS THIS. DUALITY OF BOTH THE TAX THAT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT OF OF BRINGING DOWN CONSUMPTION AND THE LONG TERM -- APPLICATION OF REVENUE TO VARIOUS PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE THAT WILL HELP. LEAD TO HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES HERE LOOK HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- LONGER LIVES. HEALTHIER LIVES -- AND LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS OVERALL. SO I'M I'M TOWARD A BIT -- ON THIS -- NO A A SHARE WITH YOU WELL WELL WHY I WAS JUST LOOKING AT KEVIN MCCARTY IS -- LITTLE JAR OVER THERE AND I'M PRETTY DARN SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT I DRINK EVERY DAY -- BACK WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL -- I WOULD DRINK FIVE OR SIX CANS OF PEPSI EVERY SINGLE DAY NOT GOOD. FOR A FOR FOR MY HEALTH AND I CAN TELL YOU THE PEOPLE MY COMMUNITY ALSO DO THAT. AS ALSO VERY TRUE -- THAT ARE -- FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE OVER USE THE TERM CRISIS BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE -- THAT WHEN IT COMES TO DIABETES AND AND AND HEART HEALTH AND AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- I HAVE A FRIEND -- MANY OF YOU HAVE -- MET HER -- WHO IS A PEDIATRIC DENTIST -- AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WAS IN THE OFFICE HAVING A MEETING WENT OVER TO MY PHONE AND SAW ON MY PHONE -- A PICTURE OF A OF A OF A CHILD THAT SHE JUST WORKED ON WAS ABOUT TO WORK ON AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE THE THE THE THESE TEETH WERE COMPLETELY CAVITY WRITTEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM COMPLETELY. DARK. AND THEN SHE TEXTED AFTER I LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID OH MY GOSH. THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD. THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD EVERY SINGLE TOOTH WAS COMPLETELY CAVITY OF LADEN AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF SUGAR SWEETENED SWEETENED BEVERAGES. AND THEN YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WELL WHAT IS IT THAT WE GET WITH THAT WE CAN -- THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT ABOUT THIS -- IS IT EDUCATION WELL THAT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT -- BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A PART OF OUR OF OUR SOCIETY AND YET THE REASON I SAID THAT I WAS A TORN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE INTENT OF THE AUTHORS -- BILL IS TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS -- THAT THAT WERE IN. AND YET I ALSO KNOW -- THAT -- TOBACCO IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I VOTED AGAINST THE TOBACCO TAX AND THE REASON I VOTED AGAINST THE TOBACCO TAXES BECAUSE PHILOSOPHICALLY WHEN I THINK. OF OF OF WHAT OUR TAX SYSTEM IS FOR IS TO BRING REVENUE INTO INTO THE THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE -- TO TO DEAL WITH -- ARE ARE THE NEEDS OF OUR BAR BASIC OUR BASIC NEEDS IT'S NOT TO INCENTIVIZE -- OR DISINCENTIVE EYES BEHAVIOR AND SO I DO I STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND I'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH IN MY HEAD WITH THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- TODAY BECAUSE YOUR INTENT IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND I WISH THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AT HOME WATCHING THIS COMMITTEE HEARING WHICH THEY'RE NOT. I WISH THAT WE ARE HAVING THESE. THEY'RE NOT -- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ALL ARE HERE BUT BUT BUT PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO BUT IT IS AFFECTING OUR LIVES IT IS AFFECTING BY THE WAY IT IS AFFECTING OUR BUDGET. IS WELL -- I'VE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS OVER OVER THE FALLS -- WAS AT A CONFERENCE A LEARNED QUITE A BIT QUITE A BIT ABOUT IT AND SUGAR IS TOXIC. AND THE LEVELS OF SUGAR THAT WE ARE TAKING IN IS IS TOXIC AND YET I STILL STRUGGLE WITH WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST AVENUE. A TO BE ABLE TO BUT TO GO DOWN TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE A SOLVE THIS PROBLEM -- BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE BUT JUST AGAIN THE THE LADY YOU KNOW WHERE I WHERE I'M AT WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER LET ME TRY TO ANSWER IT ANYWAY -- THE THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR -- WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO LOOK FOR THIS KIND OF PREVENTION PROGRAM AND IF YOU IF IF IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO FUND PREVENTION IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS JUST LIKE WE DID. WITH TOBACCO AND I DISAGREE WITH HOW YOU VOTED ON THE TOBACCO TAX BUT I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT FROM THE TOBACCO TAXES OVER TIME. AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING LONGER LIVES WHO ARE LESS DISEASE RIDDEN THAN A HAPPEN AND AND IN THE PAST. SO. YOU KNOW I'LL I LOOK AT THIS AS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY NOW IT'S VERY FOCUSED SOME FOLKS HAVE SAID DON'T TAKE MY CHOICE AWAY WE DON'T TAKE ANYBODY'S CHOICE AWAY TO DRINK ANYTHING. IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO DRINK SOMETHING THAT IS LESS HEALTHY FOR YOU. AND SO THAT IS A FACT BUT WE DON'T TAKE THE ULTIMATE CHOICE AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THAT MONEY AND WE POUR IT. INTO PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP EVERYONE. EVE EVEN IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE FORTUNATE WHO NEVER HAVE A BAD -- HEALTH PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE AND IT DOES YOU KNOW WE WE MARVEL AT THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES AND PASS AWAY HAVING HAD NO SERIOUS ILLNESSES -- THOSE CASES DO EXIST BUT EVEN FOR THOSE PEOPLE THEIR INSURANCE RATES WILL BE LESS OVER TIME IF WE'RE ABLE. TO BRING THIS DISEASE AND THE AND THE VARIOUS DISEASES THAT EXIST AS A RESULT OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO BRING THOSE DISEASE RATES DOWN. SO THERE IS NO NEGATIVE SIDE TO THIS OTHER THAN IT WILL COST A FEW MORE PENNIES. FOR A DRINK. MR FLOOR. MR BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS -- OBVIOUSLY I'M I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TO GET THERE BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS OBVIOUS. I'M I'M HOLDING OUT HOPE. YEAH. WELL WE'LL WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER BILLS -- BUT I AM CONCERNED -- WITH THIS BECAUSE THERE IS I MEAN I REPRESENT A POPULATION OF OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER. THERE ARE PLACES WHERE -- I WAS JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE AVERAGE IS ON WHAT IT COSTS FOR BOTTLE WATER VERSUS THE COST FOR A TWELVE OUNCE SODA. THESE NUMBERS ARE REAL. AND SO LIKE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT BUT I EIGHT I DO THINK THERE'S ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING WE'RE MISSING IN ALL OF THIS -- CHILDHOOD OBESITY CONVERSATION AND AS A LACK OF EXERCISE THAT OUR KIDS ARE DOING. LIKE THIS STATE WE DON'T WE DON'T ADDRESS THIS AT ALL WE TEND TO TAX EVERYTHING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO OUR KIDS TO DO WHAT WE DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO CONSUME THESE THINGS. BUT THE EXERCISE PROGRAMS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE THINGS WE DO FOR OUR KIDS TO GET THEM OUT THERE AND TO GET THEM ACTIVE I THINK WE'RE MISSING THAT. WE CAN CUT OUT ALL THE SODA IN THE WORLD THEY COULD DRINK WATER TO WHATEVER THEY'RE EATING AND THEY'RE NOT EXERCISING DEFER SETTING IN FRONT OF THEIR TV. PLAYING VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY WHEN THEY GET HOME. THIS WILL BE EASY THING IS A TRUE TRUE ISSUE LIKE CHAD -- I DRINK A LOT OF SO WHEN I WAS A KID BUT WAS ALSO VERY ACTIVE. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE ISSUES RIGHT MY DAUGHTERS I GOT TWO LITTLE GIRLS I'M IT'S A DECISION MY WIFE AND I HAVE MADE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE OTHER THINGS FOR THEM. OKAY THIS IS DECISIONS AND I AM JUST IN THE MODERN ERA OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE WAY THAT WE COMMUNICATE. STUDIES AND DATA AND AND THE DRIVERS IN THE MARKET YOU GO DOWN TO THE SUPERMARKET. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF HEALTHY OPTIONS AND THOSE WOULDN'T BE THERE IF CONSUMERS WERE BUYING THEM MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS IF NOBODY'S BUYING THEM. SO I THINK AS A AS A GENERATION IS A CULTURAL CHANGE THAT WE ARE MAKING HERE THE MANUFACTURERS ARE MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. AND I DO APPLAUD THAT NEW CONSUMERS OUT THERE FOR MAKING BETTER CHOICES BUT I WOULD I JUST WANNA PUT IT ON RECORD WE NEED TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND INTO AN EDUCATION PROGRAM AS RELATES TO EXERCISE THANK YOU WELL IF I MIGHT RESPOND VERY BRIEFLY -- WE DO IN FACT ADDRESS THAT AND SO I DO HOPE THAT -- Y'ALL Là THINK AGAIN ABOUT THIS BILL -- GOOD NUTRITION PROGRAMS -- A GOOD PREVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCUSSION ABOUT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE OF COURSE INCLUDES EXERCISE THAT EVERYONE. SHOULD HAVE -- AND IF I CAN JUST PUT IT BACK ON YOU SIR AND SAY YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY THERE. TO TAILOR THESE PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE AS A BODY THINK ARE IMPORTANT SO I'M LISTENING TO THAT COMMENT AND WE WILL CONSIDER LANGUAGE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU COME ON THE BILL OR NOT BUT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND AS A RESULT. OF OF THAT AND PUT [inaudible] MR DESERVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU'RE GETTING A GOOD DEAL BY THE WAY SOMEONE NUMBER FLORA -- I TOLD HIM HE HAD ME AT HELLO SO. NO THAT'S ON POLICY. THAT'S ON GOOD POLICY. I I SAW THAT MOVIE AND I'M NOT SURE I APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE. SORRY I'M. I'M YOUNG I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND WEALTHY. I'M STILL YOUNG. OF YEAH WE WE TALK ABOUT THESE -- EXPERIENTIAL IS AND AND AND AND AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MY TWO COLLEAGUES WHO JUST SPOKE RIGHT NOW I RESPECT YOU VERY MUCH AND I VALUE YOUR OPINION AND I UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLE YOU'RE HAVING. AND AND AND APPLYING IT TO YOUR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES WHILE WE'VE BEEN. OF MATURING IN THIS PROCESS SO WHEN WE WERE YOUNG WE DIDN'T HAVE TO THE SUPER GULP SIZES. OF OUR MADE MAYBE I'M A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU SO MAYBE YOU HAD IN YOUR YOUTH -- BUT BUT MARKETING HAS CHANGED OF THE THE PRODUCT HAS CHANGED -- THE AGGRESSIVENESS. OF THESE PRODUCTS AND THEIR MARKETING HAS CHANGED. IN FACT THEY I WASN'T REALLY GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT BUT WHEN I ALSO HEARD ABOUT HOW. SODA CONSUMPTION HAS GONE DOWN BUT IN ITS PLACE -- SMOOTHIE CONSUMPTION HAS GONE UP. I DON'T CLAIM TO BE A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER. TO CONSUME YOGURT BASED. NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE CERTAIN BACTERIA IN IT THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO YOUR BODY. UP VERSES OF AS A SUGAR BASED DRINK THAT QUICKLY TURNS INTO STARCH AND CONTRIBUTES TO MANY OTHER DISEASES THAT WE SEE. ON A DAILY BASIS IMPACTING OUR STATE BUDGET AND IS ONLY GOING TO GROW. OVER TIME. WE THINK WE HAVE PROBLEMS NOW -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS IN HEALTH CARE? THE HEART DISEASE CANCER BY THE END DIABETES RELATED DISEASES AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE OVER TIME IF WE DON'T. TRY TO TAKE STEPS THAT ARE GONNA IN A MEASURED WAY. UP CREATE A BALANCE. WE SAW THAT BALANCE HAPPEN IN THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY. AND AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS BALANCE HAPPENS -- THROUGH A MEASURE LIKE THIS THIS BALANCE HAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN THIS ARENA AS WELL. I AM -- AND MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME FOR A MINUTE I I STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS TODAY. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT'S GOING AFTER A GENERAL PRACTICE ON THE MARKETING SIDE. OF WHICH CAN THEN APPLY TO MANY OTHER. ARENAS BUT THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THIS ISSUE AREA AND WE KNOW IT'S IMPACTS. SO THAT'S WHY I'M A PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE DONE STEADFASTLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST AT LEAST. THREE YEARS -- AND THEN GOING ON MAYBE EVEN FIVE YEARS OR LONGER WITH SENATOR MINING SO THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS TO RODRIGUEZ. YES I JUST WANTED TO ECHO FEW. CONCERNS I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GO BACK ON MY COLLEAGUES HERE WITH WITH CHAD AND AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER YEARS THEY STRIKE FIVE OR SIX SODAS A DAY AND THEN? IN I DON'T SEE THE HAVING ISSUES NOW WITH WITH OBESITY OR OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER -- AND I THINK A LOT OF IT COMES UNDER CHOICE RIGHT YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT MY GROUND SINCE -- I'D TO BILLY TAKE YOUR MY GRAND KIDS EVERY WEEKEND. AND I MAKE SURE THAT THEY EAT HEALTHY STAY ACTIVE. BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY GLOVER STARTS AT HOME WITH THE UPBRINGING ARE. OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS OR WHOEVER SPECIALLY OR OR YOUR GENERATION COMES FOR THAT COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING SODA EVERY DAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN IN I THINK SODA OR ANY ANY BEVERAGE THAT CONTAINS. MORE SUGAR THAN WHAT IT SHOULD. IS MAYBE PART OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PART WHERE PEOPLE ARE HAVING DIABETES OBESITY THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IN LIFE OTHER THINGS THAT WE EAT -- THESE ARE WE CONSUME AND I THINK THE LACK OF EXERCISE IS HUGE WITH THAT AS WELL. I WAS TALKING SOME REAL TODAY TELL ME THAT. THEIR THEIR CHILD IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN HE HAS P. E. ONE DAY A WEEK AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT EVEN CHANGE WERE WE ALREADY GOING TO A DIFFERENT WAY OUT OF LIFESTYLE THAT -- WE'RE NOT KEEPING HEALTHY BEING ACTIVE LIKE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD OF RIGHT AND THEN ONCE AGAIN I SEE WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE APPLIED TO HELP IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BUT I JUST DON'T SEE THAT IMPOSING A TAX ON SODA. IS GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONE COMPONENT OF MANY OTHER COMPONENTS I SEE THAT. ATTRIBUTES TO ALL OF THESE HEALTH ISSUES OTHER THAN SODA AND ONCE AGAIN I LOOK BACK AT IT AS BEING. A CHOICE. OF OF WHAT WE EAT WHAT WE DRINK. AND AND THE UPBRINGINGS BY OUR FAMILIES ARE OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WE HANG AROUND WITH OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL AS WE TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW SODA AND SUGARY BEVERAGES HAVE BEEN. ARE NOT -- IN THEM. VENDING MACHINES THAT ARE HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR HIGH. BUT YET THEY'RE STILL ISSUE THERE WITH FOLKS HAVE BEEN OBESITY DIABETES. AND AND I GUESS THAT HELP BUT THEY'RE STILL ISSUES OUT THERE ONCE AGAIN I JUST THINK THAT. THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAN -- DRINKING SODAS AND DOING OTHER THINGS WITH THAT. US WHAT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. AND JUST WANT TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS CONCERNED ON THAT AS WELL. THREE MUCH ANYONE ELSE. WELL I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND I FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE -- IT'S I'VE I'VE I'VE. I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY PERSONALLY WORKING ON THIS ISSUE RELATED TO SUGAR -- IN SOFT DRINKS EVEN REMEMBER HOW LONG QUITE FRANKLY I REMEMBER WE LOOKED AT THE POTENTIAL OF A FIVE CENT. A GALLON TAX. OR FEE. ON THE SERVER [inaudible] YEARS AGO. AND THAT ARGUABLY WOULDN'T OF WOULDN'T HAVE -- ACOSTA CONSUMERS A GREAT DEAL BUT WHAT IT WHAT IT DONE WAS GIVE US MONEY FOR DENTAL DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND WE COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THE STARTING GATE WITHOUT QUITE FRANKLY AND IT WAS IT'S DISCOURAGING -- I AM PREVENTION ORIENTED BY NATURE THAT IS MY TRAINING THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT WAS MY CAREER. WEATHER WAS TOBACCO. FOR FOR SUGAR -- FLOOR OR JUST OTHER KINDS OF HABITS [inaudible] PREVENTION. IS THE KEY. TO LONG TERM HEALTH QUITE FRANKLY. AND SO. OUR ASK MY COLLEAGUES IN AND ONE OF HIS MISSING BUT MAYBE HE'S LISTENING SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW WE START. THAT ARE KIND OF ON THE FENCE MAYBE ON THIS TO THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. WE AS A STATE SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR A MEDICARE POPULATION ON THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES [inaudible] INSULIN. WOUND CARE SOMETIMES AMPUTATIONS AND AND SOMETIMES PROSTHETICS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO HELP WITH THE PREVENTION. IF WE COULD HAVE SOME OF THAT MONEY. FOR PREVENTION AND REAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE. ONGOING PROGRAMS NOT A YOU KNOW I ONCE ONE SHOT SORT OF PROGRAM AND AND A LITTLE EDUCATION HERE THESE HAVE TO BE ON GOING PROGRAMS TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S LIVES. WE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND WITH THE WILD RESPECT MISTER RODRIGUEZ THERE ARE SKINNY FOLKS THAT ARE DIABETIC OKAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IT DOES THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY GO HAND IN HAND -- AND SO -- I JUST YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IT IT. I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY THANK YOU OUT THERE OF SO BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL. IN MY PRACTICE -- WHEN I WAS PRACTICING DENTISTRY? I SAW A COUPLE OF THINGS I SAW THE RAVAGES OF TOBACCO. I SAW WHAT HAPPENED A PEOPLE'S MOUTHS FROM TOBACCO USE -- AND THANK GOODNESS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PASS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST REFORM PACKAGES FOR TOBACCO IN IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND THAT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WILL SAVE US MONEY ON TREATMENT FOR HEART DISEASE. CANCER YOU KNOW IMPROVE ORAL HEALTH IT'S A HUGE GAME CHANGER FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I SEE THIS THE SAME WAY. I SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I SAW IN MY PRACTICE YOUNG PEOPLE COMING INTO MY PRACTICE WITH BEAUTIFUL PERMANENT TEETH THESE ARE NOT THE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT WERE RAVAGED REALLY THESE ARE. ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS DRINKING A HALF A DOZEN SOFT DRINKS A DAY I SAW THE FROSTED APPEARANCE OF THEIR TEETH. WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND THEN WE'D SEE BEGINNINGS OF DECAY AND THEN WE START TO SEE THOSE BLACK SPOTS LATER ON AND IT'S HORRIBLE TO SEE IT'S HORRIBLE TO SEE. AND A COMMON DENOMINATOR THEIR SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED THE RESOURCES -- WE NEED TO PREVENTION -- I APPLIED YOUR TENACITY OF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AND I AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR REALLY WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES AND ONE THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MISS BURKE -- WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WAS OF CONCERN TO HER AND YOU MET WITH HER AND YOU AND AND AND YOU YOU MET HER ON THAT AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT SO -- IT IS I THINK IT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ARE STARVED FOR RESOURCES IN THIS HUGE BEAUTIFUL STATE -- TO HAVE RESOURCES TO HELP WITH THIS IN THE LONG RUN WILL HELP. INCREASE IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO COVER AND TAKE CARE OF THE REST THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA -- FOR FOR OVERALL HEALTH CARE. MAYBE IT'S A BIG DREAM BUT MAYBE WE CAN GET THERE WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE. AND THAT THAT THE SUFFERING SIZES WERE THEIR HUGE NOW THE ORIGINAL COKE WAS EIGHT OUNCES.

TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OUR PUBLIC PARTNERS LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN KEY TO OUR SUCCESS.

OUR HOSPITAL IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE BED FACILITY PROVIDING EMERGENCY MATERNITY GENERAL MEDICINE SURGERY AND ANCILLARY SERVICES. THREE YEARS INTO OUR WORK WE'RE SERVING MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR AND ARE MERCHANTS HE DEPARTMENT MAKING OURS ONE OF THE BUSIEST IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OUR VOLUME IS LARGE. LARGER THAN HOSPITALS THREE TO FOUR TIMES OUR SIZE AND REFLECTS THE LACK OF PRIMARY PREVENTIVE AND SPECIALTY CARE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE SERVE A LOW INCOME POPULATION MEDICAID BECAUSE OF LOW PROVIDER PAYMENTS FEW. DOCTORS ARE WILLING OR ABLE TO WORK IN SOUTH LA. AS A RESULT WE HAVE A DEFICIT OF TWELVE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS. OUR COMMUNITY SUFFERS SOME OF THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE DIABETES MORTALITY RATE IS 72% HIGHER THAN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN OUR COMMUNITY IS 92% HIGHER THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND DIABETIC AMPUTATIONS ARE AMONG OUR MOST FREQUENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES CARRIED OUT AT THE HOSPITAL. RECRUITING AND SUPPORTING DOCTORS WHO HAVE A PASSION FOR SERVING A SAFETY NET COMMUNITY IS KEY TO ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY IN SOUTH LA. IF YOU ARE ALREADY WITH US DOCTOR YOUR MIND EDWARDS WHO GREW UP IN OUR COMMUNITY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE HOSPITAL.

NAZARIAN ROSS FROM US I RODRIGUEZ [inaudible] SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE AND WALDRON. YOU HAVE -- FIVE WILL LEAVE THE WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR INDULGING ASIDE COLLEGE EYES FOR THEM NO WORRIES MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE -- TODAY'S SCHEDULE -- COLLEAGUES AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD HELP ADDRESS OUR STATE'S OPIOID IN ADDITION CRISIS BY ESTABLISHING A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM TO OFFER INMATES IMPROVED MEDICATION ASSISTANCE TREATMENT. FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS IN MY CITY AND COUNTY. THIS IS A COMMITTEE THE KNOWS FULL WELL THE SEVERITY OF THE OPIOID AND ADDICTION CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WERE HOSPITALIZED. DUE TO AN OPIOID OVERDOSE IN OVER TWO THOUSAND DIED. THOSE WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OPERATE OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR STATE'S PRISONS AND JAILS. A RECENT RAND STUDY FOUND THAT A PROBLEM WITH DRUG USE OR DEPENDENTS. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS COMBINES COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WITH THE USE OF FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS AND A WHOLE PERSON AND A WHOLE PATIENT APPROACH. NEWER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MATT IS A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO TREAT OPIOID USE AN ALCOHOL ABUSE DISORDER THAN EITHER BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS OR MEDICATIONS ALONE. PROVIDING ACCESS TO THIS TREATMENT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SAVINGS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT PROVIDING MATT EVERY CALIFORNIANS. WHO RECEIVES TREATMENT FOR OPIATE USE COULD RESULT IN A THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS RELATED TO REDUCE COSTS? WITH REGARDS TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND OUR HIV AIDS TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE COUNTY JAILS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE MAP FOR INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY. EXPOSURE TO THESE PROGRAMS DURING INCARCERATION CAN REDUCE DEATHS AND DRUG RELATED POISONINGS. FOR THE MORE STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT MAC REDUCE RE ENTRY INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH THAT OF A NUMBER OF WITNESSES -- AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME ON THE MAYOR OF THE CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO MARYLAND IN PRE. WELCOME MADAM MAYOR THANK YOU SO MUCH -- CHAIR WOULD AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL -- AND IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE I'M LINDEN BREED MAYOR OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. WITH A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE USE AND ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR JAILS AND PRISONS IN SAN FRANCISCO AN ESTIMATED 80%. OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS BOOKED IN OUR COUNTY JAIL. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAD A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE USE WHEN WE INCARCERATE PEOPLE WITHOUT PROVIDING THE PROPER SERVICES AND TREATMENT IT OFTEN LEADS TO SERIOUS HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. INCLUDING UNTREATED WITHDRAWAL DISRUPTED TREATMENT AND INCREASE RISK OF OVERDOSE. THESE HARMS ARE PREVENTABLE AND OUR PRIMARY DUE TO THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TREATMENT WHILE THEY IN CAR WHY THEY'RE IN JAIL. TO HELP THOSE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION WE HAVE TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE WITH PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE HELP WHILE THERE INCARCERATED WE CAN SET THEM UP FOR LATER SUCCESS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. I'VE SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE I WORK WITH IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE ADDICTED TO DRUGS. WENT TO JAIL AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT THEY WERE STILL STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. I'VE SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE WHOSE ADDICTION WHILE INCARCERATED ONLY GOT WORSE PEOPLE LIKE MY BROTHER WHO'S BEEN IN JAIL FOR TWENTY YEARS AND WHO IS STILL TO THIS VERY DAY STRUGGLING WITH AN ADDICTION. HE HAS TRIED TO SEEK TREATMENT BUT LIKE SO MANY OTHER HE SO MANY OTHERS HE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS IT'S EASY TO GET DRUGS IN JAIL AND WE NEED TO ALSO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. BUT SADLY IT'S NOT EASY TO GET TREATMENT WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND WITH THIS BILL WE CAN CHANGE THAT. ALTHOUGH TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE IS EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE COUNTY JAILS DO NOT HAVE ANY STATE OR FEDERALLY FUNDED SUPPORT TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TO INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY BECAUSE INMATES DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE. REIMBURSEMENT THE FACT THAT SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT IS COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED FROM JAIL BUT NOT COVERED WALL THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ACTUALLY IN JAIL MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE. AND FOR MANY PEOPLE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT WHILE INCARCERATED IS A CRITICAL POINT OF REHABILITATION. SAN FRANCISCO HAS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND PROVIDES RESOURCES TO SUPPORT TREATMENT FOR INMATES IN OUR COUNTY JAIL BUT THIS SUPPORT IS IN SUSTAINABLE AND WE JUST CAN'T DO IT ALONE. THIS CARE INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS A MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS TREATMENTS WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THEIR RISK OF OVERDOSE. THIS DECREASES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION STAYS AND HELPS PEOPLE WITH THEIR SUBSTANCE USE ADDICTIONS. BUT THEY'RE BETTER TREATMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE AND THERE IS A WIDER POPULATION THAT NEEDS OUR HELP AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNDER OUR CARE WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. THIS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TO BE RELEASED OUT OF OUR CARE TO SEEK HELP. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH CONDITIONS OF INMATES REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON OUR HEALTH CARE AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND REALLY SAVE LIVES SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL TODAY AND I HOPE WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL REALLY CHANGE HOW WE SUPPORT THOSE STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM [inaudible] MUCH. BUT TO NOT HIGH -- MY NAME IS ACTUALLY SO PROUD. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF JAIL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH IS A SECTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK -- OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TIMES I'M CERTIFIED IN ADDICTION MEDICINE AS WELL AS INTERNAL MEDICINE AND I OVERSEE THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM. ALSO KNOWN AS ME T. IN THE JAIL. I'D LIKE TO THANK SOME WOMEN CHIU FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY -- THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY JAIL WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM AB ONE FIVE FIVE SEVEN APPROXIMATELY 40% OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA. ARE HOUSED IN COUNTY JAILS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF WHOM SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. JAILS ARE RUN BY CITIES AND COUNTIES ON THERE ARE EMBEDDED IN THE COMMUNITY AND AS SUCH THERE'S A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TREATMENT AND RECOVERY FOR PEOPLE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENTERING JAIL AND TO CONTINUE THAT TREATMENT. WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES? AND SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE INVESTED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF TREATMENT FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THIS INCLUDES INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP THERAPY COUNSELING EDUCATION TOOLS FOR RECOVERY. WE ALSO USE MEDICATION THAT'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE TO TREAT THESE DISORDERS. CURRENTLY WHEN SOMEONE COMES INTO OUR DELAND SAN FRANCISCO AND GOES INTO OPIATE. OPIOID WITHDRAWAL WE TREAT THEM WITH THE MEDICATION THAT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE BUT SELDOM USED IN THIS CONTEXT. THIS MEDICATION IS DEEPER AND DEEPER MORPHINE FOR NURSING IS A MEDICATION THAT DECREASES THE EXTREME PHYSICAL SUFFERING OF OPIOID WITHDRAWAL AND ALLOWS YOU MAIN DETOXIFICATION. PATIENTS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY OUR PHYSICIANS DURING THIS PROCESS. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT DURING THE INCARCERATED CARRIER PROTECTS PATIENTS FROM OVERDOSING BOTH IN THE JAIL AND UPON RELEASE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABSTINENT FROM OPIOIDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OVERDOSE WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR PRE INCARCERATION LEVEL OF USE BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR TOLERANCE. WE THEREFORE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS MEDICATION FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR INCARCERATION. IT PREVENTS CRAVING AND RELAPSE WITH THE SUPPORT OF FUNDING SOURCE OFFERED THROUGH AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WE COULD DO THIS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING TREATMENT TO PATIENTS REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. BY RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE TO PURCHASE AND MAY TIAS PROPOSED HERE WILL TREAT MORE PATIENTS WHO WE KNOW WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT TREATMENT AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN LOS ANGELES ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN OUR EXPERIENCE. THEY OPERATE THE BIGGEST JAIL IN IN THE NATION -- AND THEY'RE EAGER TO TO TACKLE THIS AS WELL. THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IS DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE AFFECTED TOOLS TO IMPACT THIS VEXING ISSUE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND UNDER REPRESENTED IN ACCESS TO NEW AN EXPENSIVE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ADDRESS THAT INEQUITY THESE MEDICATIONS CHANGE LIVES AND SAVE LIVES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FURTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. TO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I YEAH I JUST LIKE TO THINK MAYOR BREED FOR COMING TODAY AND TO TESTIFY -- YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN YOUR COMMUNITY TRYING TO TACKLE THIS AND IF WE CAN BE OF SOME HELP TO GET THIS MOVING ALONG WITH THE PILOT.

ON A YOUTH AND FAMILY THEY ARE NOW SERVING NO MATTER WHERE THE ASSESSMENT OCCURRED IN THE STATE FOR WHICH SERVICE SYSTEM IT. WAS COMPLETED IN. AND THIRDLY ADMINISTRATORS AND LEGISLATORS WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AT THE PROGRAM COUNTY AND STATE WIDE LEVEL IN REAL TIME. NOT EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER. THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM WILL SAVE MONEY IN SEVERAL WAYS IT WILL DECREASE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BURDEN TIMES STAFF RESOURCES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL REDUCE THE BURDEN ON FAMILIES HAVING TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS. IT WILL ALSO IN IT ENABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS COUNTY AGENCIES STATE DEPARTMENTS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MONITOR CURRENT PROGRESS ON YOUTH AT THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM AND STATEWIDE LEVELS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT AB THREE EIGHTY FIVE IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT DATA AND IS IN NO WAY RELATED TO THIS. SKEWS ME TO THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY DH CS AND DS US ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT ARE MANDATED IN CALIFORNIA.

KIND OF PETRIE-NORRIS AB TEN THIRTY WILL EMPOWER PATIENTS BY GIVING THEM MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION. GIVEN THE MORE INVASIVE NATURE OF PUBLIC EXAMINATIONS AND RECENT HORRIFIC TALES OF ABUSE DURING THESE EXAMS. IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT PATIENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADVANCE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT DURING A PELVIC EXAM. AB TEN THIRTY REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS TO DEVELOP AN INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLETS. FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING A GYNECOLOGICAL PELVIC EXAMINATION WITH BASIC INFORMATION REGARDING HOW THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PROPERLY PERFORMED.

TEN THIRTY MY NAME IS CHRISTY LEACH AND I AM ONE OF THE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED SURVIVORS OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT OCCURRED IN STUDENT HEALTH CENTER AT USC -- AT THE HANDS OF GEORGE TYNDALL -- I'M ONE OF BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND ESTIMATED TEN THOUSAND FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT HE SAW DURING HIS TWENTY SEVEN YEAR TENURE AT USC AS THE ONLY MALE AS THE ONLY KIND OF COLLEGES IN THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- MY STORY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE STUDENTS THAT WENT INTO THE HEALTH CENTER FOR CARE -- I WENT IN BECAUSE I HAD -- SYMPTOMS OF A SINUS INFECTION. AND I CONSIDERED MYSELF LUCKY WHEN -- I WALKED INTO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER AND THE DOCTOR APPROACH ME AND LET ME INTO HIS OFFICE -- I THOUGHT WELL HELL. I'M NOT GONNA HAVE TO WAIT VERY LONG -- WHEN I WENT INTO HIS OFFICE HE SAT ME ON HIS DESK AND ASK ME MY SYMPTOMS? AND I GAVE MY SYMPTOMS AND HE DIAGNOSED ME WITH SINUS INFECTION -- GAVE ME ANTIBIOTICS AND THEN HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY -- OF A GENERAL PRACTITIONER BUT AN OBGYN AND HAD I HAD MY YEARLY EXAM YET. AND I HAD TOLD HIM THAT I HAD NEVER HAD A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM AND THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS NECESSARY -- BUT HAD AS HIS AT HIS INSISTENCE AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL I AGREE TO IT -- AND THE EXAM TABLE WAS ACTUALLY IN HIS OFFICE -- I DRESSED UNDRESSED FROM THE WAIST DOWN -- I WAS NOT GIVEN -- A CLOTH TO COVER MYSELF WITH. AND HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE WOULD NEED -- TO DO A PELVIC EXAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE NO ABNORMALITIES -- SO HE DIGITAL DIGITALLY PENETRATED ME WITH HIS HAND WITH HIS UNCLE HAVE TOWN -- AND HE MADE. HE HE JUST. DID A VERY VERY THOROUGH EXAMINATION MOVING HIS HAND IN AND OUT AND AROUND -- FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE WAS VERY PAINFUL -- I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS A SEXUAL ASSAULTS -- WHEN YOU'RE IN THOSE TYPES OF -- EXAMINATIONS I THINK YOU'RE MORE INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD. JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT -- SO I DIDN'T REALIZE. THAT IT WAS WRONG -- WHILE HE WAS EXAMINING ME HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT -- I WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I COULD BE A MODEL. AND AND THAT HE WAS SURE THAT MY MOTHER WAS BEAUTIFUL AS WELL AND THAT SHE COULD BE A MODEL AS WELL. HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT -- MY THAT I WAS I MUST BE A RUNNER BECAUSE I WAS TIGHT -- AND THEN AS HE CONCLUDED THE EXAM. HE ASKED IF HE COULD TAKE PICTURES -- BECAUSE HE WANTED TO USE THE PHOTOS -- FOR RESEARCH THAT HE WAS WORKING ON ONE THING THAT -- WE ARE PAINFULLY LEARNING. THROUGH THIS -- CASE IS THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE A CHAPERONE IN THE ROOM. IN MANY CASES OF THE OTHER. SURVIVORS -- THERE WERE CHAPERONES IN THE ROOM -- AND WE'RE LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TRUSTS -- INSTITUTIONAL EXACT -- ADMINISTRATION TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- MANY CHAPERONES I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY TO REPORT HIM -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND NOTHING WAS DONE. OUR TO DISCIPLINE HIM -- I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW -- THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN. A TRADE CLOTH TO COVER MYSELF I THINK IT'S JUST BASIC HUMAN DECENCY -- TO RESPECT SOMEONE'S PRIVACY -- I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WEARING A GLOVE -- BEFORE HE PENETRATED ME -- AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT THE PELVIC EXAM WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SO INVASIVE -- ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TIME -- ONE WAS HAVING AN EXAM -- SO I AM I ASK THAT YOU WOULD PLEASE.

TO GO TO FARMS PETRIE-NORRIS YOUR NEXT. AB. FIVE TWENTY SIX MEMBERS I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY FIVE TO SIX THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPELL IS TO ENSURE THAT VULNERABLE INFANTS CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN. RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED AND ARE ENTITLED TO THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH AN EXPEDITED PATHWAY FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT FROM THE SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM. FOR WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN KNOWN AS WACK. WHICH IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE BIRTH AND HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME PREGNANT WOMEN CHILDREN AND INFANTS ON AVERAGE ONE POINT ONE MILLION CHILDREN AND INFANTS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE COVERED EACH MONTH BY WHACK THERE ARE SIMILAR ELIGIBILITY CONDITIONS BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND WAKE. BUT DESPITE THIS MORE THAN EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO ARE ENROLLED IN WAY. AND ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR MEDI CAL ARE STILL NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICAID. TO ENSURE THAT THESE VULNERABLE INFANTS CHILDREN PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED WE NEED TO STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. CURRENTLY THE WICK ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM ALREADY TAX PARTICIPANTS MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT BY LINKING TO MEDIC HEALTH DATABASE. BUT WHEN FAMILIES AREN'T ENROLLED WE CAN ONLY GIVE THEM A REFERRAL. AB FIVE TO SIX WILL ESTABLISH EXPRESS LANE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT. WITH WITH WITH APPLICANT DOES NOT SHOW MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE CONSENT TO INITIATE EXPRESS LANE ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT. USING THE WACK ELIGIBILITY FINDINGS. WE THINK THIS IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION TO ADDRESS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST CRITICAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE GAPS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO SUPPORTERS HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THE MOTION AND A SECOND PLEASE. GO AHEAD. NINE YEAR ON THAT CAN YEAR NOW.

AND AND NOW THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS IN ROLLING SO REALLY THE WORK OF COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN INVOLVES MAXIMIZING ENROLLMENT. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL -- IS -- A SMART STRATEGY BY GOING TO WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN LIVE AND EXIST IF THEY SHOW UP AT PROGRAMS LIKE WE ASK A NUTRITION PROGRAM. AND SO THIS OFFERS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL THEM FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THE BENEFIT AS YOU HEARD IS THAT THEY ALREADY PROVIDED INFORMATION -- THAT COULD BE USED TO JUST QUICKLY AND ROLL THEM INTO MEDI CAL AND AS YOU ALSO HEARD -- THE THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE KNOW OF THESE FOLKS THAT WE KNOWN EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN WE KNOW THEIR NAMES AND WE KNOW THEIR NUMBERS AND WE'RE NOT. IN ROLLING THEM BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGIES THROUGH THE FEDERAL -- LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR EXPRESSING MOMENT TO USE WICK FINDINGS SO THIS REALLY IS A PERFECT ALIGNMENT WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAMS. THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORWARD IN HIS -- INITIATIVE TO TRY AND REACH CHILDREN AND AT THE EARLY STAGES IN LIFE AND CONNECT THEM TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED JUST NOT JUST NUTRITION BUT ALSO HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT AS THEIR STARTING OFF THEIR LIVES -- AND WE ARE -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU.

OKAY. MOTION AND A SECOND. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING -- THIS TO BE HEARD TODAY AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU. TO A SIMILAR FOR CARRYING THIS BILL. MY NAME IS BILL UPTICK I'M A PRACTICING CHIROPRACTOR HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS I WORK IN A HIGHLY INTEGRATED CLINIC. IN SAN JOSE ON SITE AT CISCO WITH MEDICAL DOCTORS PHYSICAL THERAPIST ACUPUNCTURISTS CHIROPRACTORS -- PAPER HEALTH COUNSELORS -- A PHARMACY PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT A A COMPANY WOULD WANT TO PUT AN ONSITE CLINIC TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES HEALTHY AND HAPPY -- REGARDING THE AB. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HAVE A FIXABLE. PROBLEM THAT IS STILL KILLING HUNDREDS MORE LIKE THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR. THE LAST OFFICIAL DATA WE HAVE IS FROM. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A PUTS THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AT ALMOST TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT YEAR. AND IT IS NOT JUST THOSE TESTS BUT THE THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN RUINED. IT IS ALL OF THE CHILDREN THEY HAVE LOST A PARENT AS WILL THE PAIN DISABILITY AND FINANCIAL RUIN. COST TO THOSE WHO AVOIDED DEATH BUT NOT THE ADDICTION WITH AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WE ARE ASKING YOU TO WORK TO HELP STOP FEELING THE FINAL OF PEOPLE BEING GIVEN PRESCRIPTIONS. THERE THE FOUNDATION OF THIS PROBLEM. TO QUOTE DOCTOR EVAN WOULD. MD PHD WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA STUDYING ADDICTION MEDICINE AND DRUG POLICY. HE STAYED IN THE NEW IN THE MESS JOURNAL OF MEDICINE THAT THE ORIGINS OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC CAN BE TRACED TO OVER PRESCRIPTION OF NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND AQUATIC ANALGESICS ARE OPIOIDS. YOUR SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WILL FACILITATE A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO UNDO THIS PROBLEM THROUGH A MECHANISM THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. FULL INFORMED CONSENT. IT IS ACTUALLY STRIKING THAT HAS NOT ALREADY IN PLACE FOR OPIOIDS. AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WILL REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE TRUE RISKS OF OPIOIDS TO THE PATIENT. THROUGH A DISCUSSION AND A SIGNED CONSENT SO THAT PATIENTS CAN MAKE. AN INFORMED DECISION. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WILL ALSO PUT IN PLACE. A REQUIREMENT TO PRESCRIBERS INFORM PATIENTS THAT EVIDENCE BASED ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS EXIST. INCLUDING NON PHARMACOLOGICAL PROVIDERS. WHAT THE RESEARCHERS TOLD US OF THE PAST FEW YEARS IS THAT FOR PAIN YOUR TO GENERALLY ARE NOT RECOMMENDED AND THE NON PHARMACOLOGICAL PROVIDERS MENTIONED IN THIS BILL MOST DEFINITELY ARE? THERE IS NO MANDATE TO FORCE THE PRESCRIBER TO PICK ANY SPECIFIC PROVIDER OR TO MAKE A DIRECT REFERRAL. ONLY TO ALERT THE PATIENT ABOUT SEVERAL EVIDENCE BASED CLASSES OF PROVIDERS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT LAST THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ADDING THE LIST OF NON PHARMACOLOGICAL PROVIDERS TO THE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS PACKAGE. WHEN IT IS NEXT EVALUATED? THIS IS NEEDED AS IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EXPECT THE PATIENT TO USE EVIDENCE BASED PROVIDERS. UNLESS THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. IN SUMMARY WERE ASKING YOU TO REQUIRE AND DOCUMENT THAT PATIENTS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRESCRIBER UNDERSTANDS WHEN THEY'RE BEING GIVEN AN OPIOID IN CLOSING. YOU KNOW I GET HOME FROM WORK MY WIFE SOMETIMES WILL ASK ME. IN A SEMI SERIOUS WAY AS I AM A CHIROPRACTOR IF I SAVED THE LIFE TODAY. IF THIS BILL PASSES AND GETS IMPLEMENTED WE CAN ALL SAY WE SAVED MANY LIVES TODAY. AND YOU CAN SAY THAT WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. CARE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DR DANI GAMBINO I'M A DOCTOR CHIROPRACTIC IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECT ASSOCIATION A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. SEEING FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS -- IT'S CLEAR THAT. CHANGES NEEDED AWAITED MET PAY MANAGEMENT IS HANDLED AND CARPET CARE ANOTHER NON PHARMACOLOGICAL -- TREATMENTS ARE PROVEN AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DEALING WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT. COCKERELL STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE. TO FIND PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WILL BEND THE CURVE. FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITIES BE TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB. EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. TOM RENT FREE WITH ACCOUNT TO BE ABLE HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI CRYSTAL WARD WITH CAL TYRONE I TEACH PUBLIC HEALTH THAT LIFE CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE WEST NAY STRONGLY SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. TO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT ARE FO ALL TO A NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN IF APPROPRIATE CMA REMAINS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO AB. EIGHT EIGHTY DUE TO CONCERNS OF THE REMAINING PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. AB EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRES A PHYSICIAN DISCUSS NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS WITH EVERY PATIENT RECEIVING A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN OPIOID. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY BROAD PROVISION AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THESE NON NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY TYPE OF PAIN A PATIENT AS SUFFERING FROM. FOR INSTANCE A VISIT TO THE CHIROPRACTOR WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR PATIENTS WHO JUST HAVE THEIR WISDOM TEETH REMOVED. THE DISCUSSION OF THESE TREATMENT OPTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE HAD WITH THE PATIENTS IF THE OPTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PATIENT. SIMILAR TO THE OFFER OF OUR FOR ALL. ADDITIONALLY THE REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN SIGNED INFORMED CONSENT ATTEMPTS TO STATUTORILY DICTATE INFORMED CONSENT. REQUIRING A SIGNATURE THAT THE PATIENT HAS RECEIVED SPECIFICALLY THOSE WARNINGS INCLUDED IN THE STATUTE. THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL DISCUSSION ON OPIOIDS WILL NOW BE MANDATED AND EVERY ELEMENT OF THE DISCUSSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE RECITED DIMINISHING THE VALUE OF THE DISCUSSION COMPLETELY. FINALLY THE BILL SIMPLY STATES INTENT THAT THESE NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE STATE REVISITS IT'S ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SERVICES HINDERS DIRECTLY ON THE LACK OF COVERAGE FOR MOST OF THE SERVICES BY HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS. INSTEAD OF MANDATING THAT A PHYSICIAN PROVIDE A REFERRAL TO AN AND IDENTIFIED IT LIKELY UNCOVERED PROVIDER. WE THINK OF THE BEST PATHWAY WOULD BE TO SEE COVERAGE FOR THESE NON OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON THE POLICY. THREE MUCH OTHER OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I'D LIKE TO MISTER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION BUT SURE SURE YES -- AGAIN -- THE PHRASES -- TO OFFER OR FOR ALL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE -- A PATIENT TO TRY ANY OF THESE TREATMENTS BUT INSTEAD TO BE OFFERED ONE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE DOCTOR PROVIDE A PATIENT -- SPECIFICALLY WITH THESE TREATMENTS BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THEM AS ALTERNATIVES. AND THE REFER A WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO THE KID I MEAN I THINK THE QUESTION WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD HER WISDOM TEETH OUT MR WOULDN'T BE REFERRED TO A CHIROPRACTOR. YES YES -- YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT -- THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND OTHER BUT THIS -- I THINK THE IN PRACTICE. OR EVERY REFER I WOULD SUGGEST IN MALPRACTICE -- THIS IS NOT THE INTENT AND IT CAN IT'S JUST AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NON PRESCRIPTION OF THE OPIOIDS. AND TREATMENT OF PAIN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEE SEE -- NINE THAT YOU THAT YOU. DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS BURKE A SECOND BY.

I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL. ELEVEN SIXTEEN EMERGENCY PERSONNEL A SERVICE PERSONNEL WORKING UNPREDICTABLE HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENTS THEY CAN TAKE AN OVERWHELMING MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL TOLL THAT DOES NOT SUBSIDE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL SHIFT IS DONE. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EMOTIONAL STRESS THE FIRST RESPONDERS EXPERIENCE CAN MANIFEST IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SUBSTANCE A SURVEY CO AUTHORED BY CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND NBC BAY AREA FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE IN SIX FIREFIGHTERS HAS CONSIDERED SUICIDE NATIONAL SURVEYS HAVE PUT THAT NUMBER AS HIGH AS ONE IN. THREE WELL SUPPORT SERVICES MAY BE AVAILABLE IN SOME CASES FIRST RESPONDERS ARE OFTEN RELUCTANT TO UTILIZE THEM FOR REASONS INCLUDING FEAR OF ADVERSE JOB IMPACTS THE STIGMA SURROUNDING THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND THE PERCEPTION AMONG EMERGENCY PERSONNEL THAT THEY MUST SHOW NO SIGNS OF WEAKNESS. AB ELEVEN SIXTEEN WILL INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF PEER SUPPORT AND CRISIS REFERRAL SERVICES BY ALLOWING FOR CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TRAINED PEER SUPPORT PERSONNEL. AND THEIR FELLOW FIREFIGHTERS PROVIDING PEER SUPPORT TRAINING TO EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY PROVIDING INFORMAL SOME OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WILL INCREASE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY. A POTENTIAL HIGH RISK SITUATION BEFORE A CRISIS EVENT OCCURS. WITH -- WITH ME TODAY I HAVE WITNESSED THAT ALLOWED TO SELF INTRODUCE. THANK. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS REX PRITCHARD AND I'M -- ENGINEER WITH THE LONG BEACH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND I'M PRESIDENT OF LONG BEACH FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION.

ELEVEN SIXTEEN IN THE COURSE OF DOING OUR JOB FIRST RESPONDERS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO FACE THE TRIALS THAT FEW OF US CAN EVER IMAGINE. WHETHER IT'S A CATASTROPHIC FATAL FIRE SHOOTING AUTO ACCIDENTS PLANE CRASHES OR TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE FIREFIGHTERS CONFRONT THE HORRORS OF LIFE AND BEAR WITNESS IS THE PAIN OF DEATH. EVERY SINGLE DAY. ALL TOO OFTEN FIREFIGHTERS TRIED. TO BURY THE WRENCHING EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THESE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. THEY TRIED TO LET GO OF THESE EVENTS BUT SOMETIMES THE EVENTS WON'T WILL GO OF US. NATIONAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE FIREFIGHTERS SUFFERS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER ROUGHLY THE SAME RATE THAT IS SEEN IN THE MILITARY. FIREFIGHTERS ARE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES AS THEY ARE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES IN A FIRE OR OTHER TRAUMATIC EVENT. OFTEN THESE VICTIMS HAVE SUFFERED IN SILENCE CONCERNED THAT OPENING UP ABOUT ACUTE STRESS MIGHT PUT THEIR JOB AT RISK. OR BRAND NAME IS UNFIT FOR DUTY. WE KNOW THAT PEER SUPPORT. FIREFIGHTERS TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY WITH OTHER FIREFIGHTERS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP WITH THE HEALING PROCESS. AB ELEVEN SIXTEEN IS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO SEEK AND RECEIVE THIS CRUCIAL ASSISTANCE. IT CALLS UPON CALLOW YES TO DEVELOP A FIRE SPECIFIC PEER SUPPORT TRAINING COURSE. THAT PEER SUPPORT MEMBERS MUST TAKE. THE COURSE TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTER JOIN APPRENTICE COMMITTEE WILL COVER THE RANGE OF TOPICS ON PEER SUPPORT AND STRESS MANAGEMENT DRAWING ON EXPERTS IN THE AREA. MORE IMPORTANTLY AB ELEVEN SIXTEEN INJURES THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SAPIR SUPPORT MEMBERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WILL BE CONFIDENTIAL. UNDER BUT THE BILL THESE COMMUNICATIONS CAN NOT BE USED AGAINST A FIREFIGHTER OR THE QUALIFIED PEER SUPPORT PERSONNEL IN A CIVIL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING. THE BILL CONTAINS EXEMPTIONS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO LIFE AND LIMB OR IF THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF A CRIME BEING COMMITTED. CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE ON BEHALF OF THIRTY THOUSAND FRONTLINE FIREFIGHTERS WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDES AN OPENING FOR MEMBERS TO SEEK THE HELP THEY NEED. WITHOUT WORRYING THAT IT COULD COST THEM THE JOB THAT THEY LOVE. AND I'M GONNA GO A LITTLE BIT OFF SCRIPT RIGHT NOW AND TALK BLUNTLY ABOUT -- INCIDENT. NO LOSS OF ONE OF OUR BROTHERS CAPTAIN DAVE ROSA WHO WAS MURDERED IN LONG BEACH JUNE TWENTY FIFTH -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN VERY DRAMATIC EVENT FIREFIGHTERS AREN'T MEANT. ART EVER EXPECT TO GET SHOT AND KILLED. WHILE RESPONDING TO A OF FIRE IN FIGHTING A FIRE -- IT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

THINGS THEY'VE SEEN ANECDOTES -- WERE OFFICERS WILL BE INVOLVED IN -- SHE ANY KIND OF VIOLENT ACT SHOOTING CAR ACCIDENT AND THE OFFICERS -- WILL REVISIT THE SCENE AFTER THE FACT AND JUST START SPEAKING GIBBERISH -- THEY JUST COMPLETELY ZONE OUT -- OFFICERS WILL COME BACK TO THE STATION AND TAKE OFF THEIR GUN BELT AND HAVE THEIR UNIFORM ON AND THEN PUT SNEAKERS ON AND JUST START WALKING AROUND -- IN LONG BEACH -- JUST WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE HAD TWO OFFICERS COMMIT SUICIDE -- BOTH HAD FAMILIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN -- ONE WAS RECENTLY RETIRED AND ONE WAS ACTIVE -- THERE'S JUST NO MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR THESE OFFICERS TO SEEK HELP -- THERE WAS NO ONE EARLY INTERVENTION -- WE SEEN TWO OR THREE OTHER CASES BE TST IN LONG BEACH TURN IN A FULL BLOWN MEDICAL CRISES -- OFTEN THE SITUATIONS IF THEY'RE NOT ADDRESS BY PROFESSIONAL HELP CAN TURN IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE. OR SWORE SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR WORSE AS WE'VE SEEN. OUR OFFICE OR SIMPLY NEED AN OPTION TO COME FORWARD WITHOUT THE THREAT OF TERMINATION TO SEEK HELP AB ELEVEN SEVENTEEN WILL HELP ESTABLISH A CRITICAL FIRST STEP AT INTERVENTIONS THESE OFFICERS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER. IN SILENCE WE RESPECTFULLY ESCRIBO THANK YOU. SIR. MONEY IS A JOB GROWN. SORRY MY NAME IS JOHN BROWN AND I'M A PARTNER IN THE LAW FIRM OF ADAMS FROM THE BROWN ARE FIRM SPECIALIZES IN THE REPRESENTATION. OF PUBLIC SAFETY FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS. AND I'VE BEEN SPECIALIZING IN WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU IN THE LAST THREE YEARS I HAVE NOT HAD. AS MANY SUICIDE CASES IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I WAS PRACTICING. SO RIGHT NOW I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH TEN CASES ALL RELATING. TO POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS THE COMMON THREAD I HAVE FOUND WHEN I HAD THE INTERVIEW THESE SAD CASES. IS THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T SEEK TREATMENT AT ALL. IN FACT THEY RESISTED IT OUT OF FEAR AND THE MINDSET WAS THAT THEY OBTAIN TREATMENT. THEY WERE EITHER ELIMINATING A STIGMA OF WEAKNESS OR WORSE THEY WERE IN FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. WE HAVE COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS THAT ONE DAY OF CARE AND THEY GO BACK TO WORK YEARS LATER WE FIND PERSONAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO PEEL BACK. TO THAT VERY ISSUE. IN THE END THE MANTRA THAT I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR IS CARE BECAUSE THE SOONER WE GET MEDICAL CARE TO THESE OFFICERS. THE SOONER THEY MAY NOT AND IN THESE OTHER CASES WHERE THEY'VE TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LIVES. AND WE HAD A CASE IN ONTARIO WERE. THE POLICE OFFICER WAS IN A STRESSFUL. HOMICIDE CASE INVOLVING CHILDREN THAT WERE KILLED. AND AFTER -- TWO YEARS. OF LITTLE LITIGATION THAT AT THE JURY ENDED IN A HUNG JURY. AND HE WAS SO DISTRAUGHT BY DEALING WITH THE VICTIM FOR TWO YEARS. I COULDN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE THE END OF HIS LIFE IN HIS GARAGE HE NEVER SOUGHT TREATMENT. THE PAIN OF IT YOU JUST DID IS WIFE IT'S ONE WHERE WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO A DOCTOR. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE ACCESS ENSURING CONFIDENTIALITY WE'RE TRYING. TO LOWER THE STIGMA THAT YOU CAN GO FIND A PLACE THAT'S SAFE TO GET CARE SO THAT THESE TRAGIC RESULTS DON'T HAPPEN EVER AGAIN. SO I REALLY HOPE. AND PRAY THAT YOUR WISDOM WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE OF THESE INSTANCES THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH IS A CONTINUATION OF MY PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO ENSURE OUR COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE. AND ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION PILOT PROGRAM ARE ABLETO BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE. MEMBERS WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS CRISIS IS EVIDENT WHEN PEOPLE CALL. PARAMEDICS RESPOND TO THE HEALTH TO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE EMERGENCY. ONLY TO HAVE. SENT TO PATIENTS TO OVERCROWDING E. R. WHERE THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY PROPER CARE. MANY NINE ONE ONE USERS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVED TIMELY CARE BECAUSE OUR PARAMEDICS ARE ABLE TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO OUR ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION SUCH AS A MENTAL HEALTH OR A SOBERING CENTER. COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINES ALLOW SPECIFICALLY TRAINED PARAMEDICS TO PERFORM OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL ROLE AND ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE. ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR GIVES LOCAL AGENCIES THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS AND REQUIRED THE STATE'S AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP A MINIMUM OF MEDICAL STANDARD. IT IS A THOUGHTFUL BALANCED APPROACH THAT GIVES LOCAL AGENCIES FLEXIBILITY WHICH SCREENING WHILE ENSURING THE HIGH STANDARD OF CARE IS MET AT EVERY PROGRAM. THIS BILL. IS THE RIGHT IS RIGHT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDING -- AND SUPPORTED BY OF OUR PARAMEDICS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- BY OUR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS I WANT TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT WE TRUST OUR PARAMEDICS NOT HEALTH -- PROFESSIONALS NGUYEN OUR LOVE ONES [inaudible] SUFFERS STROKE.

I WILL SIMPLY SAY THAT -- THE COMMITTEE PARAMEDIC PROGRAM IN THE ONES THAT WE'VE RUN AND ALSO THE ONES HAVE BEEN RUN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THERE ARE PROACTIVE WAY OF DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE OUT ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY -- THE PEOPLE THAT WE HELP ARE OFTEN THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY -- PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A NETWORK OF RESOURCES IF ANY OF YOU HAVE HAD -- FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR ANY KIND OF TREATMENT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT SET UP -- TO TO TO GET PEOPLE A 100% WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED -- OFTEN TIMES IT'S JUST TO GET THEM HEALTHY ENOUGH TO GET OUT THE DOOR AND CONTINUE TREATMENT AND AT HOME -- WHERE ARE PROGRAM COMES IN -- IS TO BASICALLY FILL GAPS THAT EXIST IN THE SYSTEM AS A AS A CURRENTLY -- AS A CURRENTLY FACES US -- WE DO NOT REPLICATE SERVICES WERE NOT TRYING TO BE NURSES -- WE'RE SIMPLY USING OUR TRUSTED POSITIONS -- TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD OFTENTIMES GO UNTREATED OTHERWISE -- SOMETIMES IT'S A SIMPLE IS IS JUST MAKING A PHONE CALL IN MAKING SURE THAT SOMEONE'S GOT A MEDICATION ON HAND OR IF THEY NEED TO GET IT THAT WE CAN GO PICK IT UP FORM -- OTHER TIMES IT'S A SIMPLE AS AS CALLING THE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES OF PEOPLE WERE SITE THAT PEOPLE ARE DESIGNED TO THEM ON THEIR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL. AND FINDING OUT WHEN THEY'RE GONNA START THE SERVICES BECAUSE SOMETIMES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A FOR NOT BEING SIGNED PROPERLY STOP THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF SOME WAS DISCHARGED HOME. AND THEY DON'T GET ANY FOLLOW UP CARE BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDN'T FILL OUT A FORM PROPERLY IT WAS RECEIVED PROPERLY -- SO AGAIN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME HERE TODAY THE PROGRAM DOES WORK THE DATA SHOWS IT -- UCSF IS HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT -- ON BEHALF OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE RUN THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MEMBERS TO MEN REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND WE ARE A CO SPONSOR OF AB. FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR IS MISTER GIBSON HIGHLIGHTED WE DO HAVE A CRISIS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AS YOU ALL UNDERSTAND. HE AND THIS BILL PROVIDES A NICE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE PATIENTS WHO MAY NOT NEED TO BE IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT AND GET THEM TO THE CARE THEY NEED AT THAT TIME. THE ALTERNATE DESTINATION PROGRAMS WHETHER GOES TO A SOARING CENTER OR TO A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY THESE ARE PATIENTS THAT ARE FALLING SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS ARE DON'T THAT ARE -- ORGANIZED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE WITH THESE WE THINK PROVIDE THE PROPER PROTECTIONS AND ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS WITH THE THE POST DISCHARGE CARE. WHERE THESE ARE PATIENTS THAT IF LEFT UNATTENDED MAY END UP BACK IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH THE HELP OF THE PARAMEDICS WE BELIEVE THEY'LL GET THE CARE? THAT WILL -- KEEP THEM FROM COMING BACK TO US WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA WERE NEUTRAL AND APPRECIATE THE SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBER SYLVIA SOLELY SHAMAN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS CAN HE TEN YOU'D WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA'S LIKE HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNION NURSES -- WE OPPOSE AB -- FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH IMPLEMENTS PROGRAMS WHICH THREATENED PATIENT SAFETY. PARAMEDICS RESPONDED NINE ONE ONE CALLS ASSASSIN TRIAGE PATIENTS AND TRANSPORT THEM TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AS POSSIBLE PARAMEDICS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS THEY RELY UPON DIRECTION FROM POSITIONS ARE REGISTERED NURSES. FUNCTIONING UNDER SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS IN THE PRE HOSPITAL SETTING THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING REFLECT THOSE LIMITATIONS. SCENE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POST DISCHARGE COMPONENT OF THE COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE PROGRAM. THERE CONTINUES TO BE AN INCREASE IN THE RATE OF RE HOSPITALIZATION FOR THE BUTTE AND ALAMEDA COUNTY POST DISCHARGE PILOT PROJECTS WHICH USE PARAMEDICS INSTEAD OF REGISTERED NURSES TO PROVIDE HOSPITAL FOLLOW UP CARE. THIS MEANS PARAMEDICS WOULD BE SENT TO PATIENTS HOMES AFTER THEIR DISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL TO FOLLOW UP ON PAIN MANAGEMENT DRUG ORDERS LONG TERM WOUND CARE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER POST HOSPITAL ISSUES THEY'RE NOT TRAINED. FOR IN THESE PILOTS INTERVENTIONS BY PARAMEDICS INSTEAD OF NURSES INCREASED THE RATE OF HOSPITAL READMISSIONS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOAL OF THESE PROJECTS IS TO DECREASE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS. IN FACT YOU COUNTY HAD NEARLY ONE THIRD RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH VARIOUS PROBLEMS LATE LAST YEAR BUTTE ACTUALLY JUST CONTINUE THE PROJECT DUE TO BUDGETARY ISSUES. AND THE PARAMEDICS INABILITY TO PERFORM THEIR EMERGENCY SERVICES AND COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC DUTIES. EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GET WORSE FOR THESE PILOT PROJECTS AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR INCLUDES THE POST DISCHARGE PRORAMS. THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSED OUR ENDS IN CALIFORNIA A HUNDRED THOUSAND LPNS AND MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LICENSE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE DIRECT ACUTE CARE TO PATIENTS. IN CALIFORNIA LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND EMTS AND PARAMEDICS ARE EMPLOYED AND THEY'RE ONLY THIRTY THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS WERE DULY CERTIFIED AS EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. THIS BILL IS BASED ON THE FLAWED PREMISE THAT PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS CAN PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES IN ADDITION TO AND DURING. THEIR TRADITIONAL EMERGENCY SERVICES ROLE WHY SHOULD DULY CERTIFIED FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS BE DIVERTED FROM THEIR PRIMARY TASK OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS LIKE THE CURRENT AND RECENT FIRE SEASONS AND SUBSEQUENT MUD SLIDES. NURSES STRONGLY OPPOSE EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR BECAUSE IT IN THE INTEREST PAID CHEN SAFETY AND WE ASK YOU ABOUT NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON BRING UP ROUTES KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; YEP THE CALIFORNIA&lt;/c&gt; ASSOCIATION HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME LIKE TO LAND MY COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE HERE WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE POSTERS CHARGE FOLLOW UP. AND THE HOSPICE CARE. REGARDING HOSPICE THERE IN A SPECIFIC END OF LIFE PLAN OF CARE. ON THAT THE M. T. WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO NECESSARILY MEET THOSE NEEDS AND OFTENTIMES WOULD CAUSE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FOR THE HOSPICE AGENCY IF THEY WERE TO GET INVOLVED -- FOR THE PUSHES CHARGE FOLLOW UP -- WE HAVE TRAINED -- NURSES THAT ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO WORK WITH THE CLIENT IN A HOME FOR EXAMPLE IF A CLIENT IS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL WAS TOLD TO BE BED DOWN FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEY'RE IN THEIR HOME AND THEY'RE FIGHTING I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT DOWN I WANT TO GET UP WE HAVE NURSES THAT ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THOSE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. OTHER TIMES IF -- THE GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOM OF THE MERGERS EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR PRESCRIBES ONE TYPE OF MEDICINE. THEIR PRIMARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED ANOTHER TYPE OF MEDICINE THOSE TWO MEDICINES WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MIXED TOGETHER WELL. A HOME HEALTH NURSE NURSE IS -- WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR TO SAY HEY WE NEED TO MAKE SOME KIND OF CHANGES HERE OR ELSE THIS PERSON'S GOING RIGHT BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL. ANY ANTI MAY NOT BE ABLE -- TO DECISION WAIT THAT SITUATION SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR NO THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. IT IS AT ALL SERVICES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND IF I COULD JUST BE BRIEF -- THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE AND CONTINUING TO MARK UP AMENDMENTS -- THAT THEY CAN REVIEW HOWEVER I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE LOCAL EMS AT ORTIZ ALREADY HAD AGENCIES ARE YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO ALTERNATE DESTINATION IN FACT. THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES A TORY AT THE STATE LEVEL JUST RECENTLY RELEASED REGULATIONS LAST FRIDAY THAT WE BELIEVE CLARIFIES THAT THERE'S OTHER AREAS OF OUR AMENDMENTS BUT TO BE BRIEF I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE ON OPTION -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FAIR MCDADE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. WILLINGNESS TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE -- WE DO BELIEVE COUNTIES HAVE THIS AUTHORITY BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY -- AS SOME OF THE OTHER OPPOSITION MENTION AND COUNTY AUTHORITY TO KEEP A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OPERATIONAL AND WE HAVE CONCERNS AT THIS BILL WOULD FRAGMENT THE SYSTEM THANK YOU. KELLY BROOKS I'M UP HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN -- COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS THE MINUTE POSITION I'M WILL BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. BETSY ARMS ARE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANYONE ELSE. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. A MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TENACITY -- I HAVEN'T SUPPORTED THIS BILL IN THE PAST -- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. THIS MOVES FORWARD SINCE IT SEEMS. TO BE -- OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO YOU -- SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- IF IF COUNTIES. IF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF DOING THIS ALREADY IS THERE SEVERAL PILOT PROJECTS. WHY DOES IT? NEED LEGISLATION. TO AUTHORIZE. THANK YOU STE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THESE COUNTIES NOW ARE OPERATING UNDER WHAT'S IN AN OFSTED PILOT HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE PILOT PROGRAM. OF THE WHOLE FUNCTION OF ALL SHIFTED PILOT PROGRAMS IS TO TEST AN INNOVATIVE MODEL OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY TO SEE IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THOSE ARE TIME LIMITED PILOTS. AND SO THEY HAVE UNDERGONE MULTIPLE EXTENSIONS AND I THINK THE OFFER DIRECTOR BECAUSE BEGRUDGINGLY EXTENDED IT ONE MORE YEAR. AFTER THE VETO MISTER GIBSON'S BILL AND SO WE ARE CONTINUALLY. A BY HIS SIDE TO NATION'S THE FIGHTING TO GET THESE PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED STATEWIDE ABSENT THAT AUTHORIZATION THOSE PILOTS WILL HAVE TO SHUT DOWN BUT DOT BUT SECOND CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR. OF BUT THAT DOESN'T NEED. IT DOESN'T AVOID DIDN'T NEED LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION -- THAT WAS A REGULATORY BODY THAT PLACE. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST CONTINUE THIS? I THINK I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO ON THAT ASKED AND ANSWERED THIS IS A A PARAMEDIC WHO IS OPERATING. IN A DIFFERENT ROLE AS DESCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR AND SO THEREFORE. ABSENT THE PROTECTIONS OF THESE PILOTS GOVERNED BY OFSHE HEAD OF WITH MUCH OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND DATA AND REPORTING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE UCSF STUDIES. SUGGESTING HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO NEGATIVE PATIENT OUTCOMES IN ANY OF THE PILOTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR YEARS. THAT THEY ARE THEN GOING TO RELY ON THAT DATA IN AND PRESENT THIS TO YOU THE DECISION MAKERS TO WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PASS A LAW TO AUTHORIZE THESE PROGRAMS PERMANENTLY STATEWIDE OR TO LET THEM SUNSET. AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER IDEA. SO IS THIS IS THIS. WELL -- WHAT WOULD TEND TO BE THE NEXT STEP AFTER THIS IF THIS WERE TO PASS AND IF THIS COME BECOMES LAW? THEN WHAT HAPPENS. EXCELLENT QUESTION AND AND MAYBE IT ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN OPPOSITION THAT IS. MISTER GIVENS BILL IS OPTIONAL. SO TO THE POINT ABOUT. POTENTIALLY CREATING A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM NOT SO. COUNTIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTROL OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY PURSUE A COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS SPECIALTY OR ALTER DESTINATION SPECIALTY AND WHICH ONE HOW MANY AND IT IS THEIR JOB TO THEN COLLABORATE WITH ALL OF THE SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM THAT FITS RIGHT FOR THAT COUNTY IN THAT COMMUNITY -- I I'VE. I'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT THIS IN THE PAST -- I STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS. ON SEVERAL LEVELS. AB. ONE I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF. SOMEONE IN A PARAMEDIC POSITION -- AND I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THEIR CAPABILITY. THE SAVE LIVES BUT IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT TRAINING IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO ALWAYS. ADDRESS SOME ISSUES. ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT HAVEN'T NECESSARILY SHOWN. ADVERSE OUTCOMES. BUT THAT'S ALSO VAN I THINK ON STUDIES BASED ON ONLY ABOUT TWO YEARS. SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE CASE LOAD HAS BEEN. I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN A LOT OF NUMBERS ON THIS SO IT'S PART OF MY THAT'S ON ME -- BUT THERE'S THAT INHERENT ISSUE THAT KIND OF BOTHERS ME BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO MISCALCULATE SOMETHING. SECOND. IT IT'S CREATING ISSUES AMONGST. THE LABOR FAMILY THAT I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT [inaudible] OF WOULD BE COMING OUT. SO I WOULD VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO CONTINUE WORKING. WITH ALL SIDES TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN -- ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ONGOING ISSUES BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. THERE ARE OUTSIDE PRESSURES. SAYING THAT THE COSTS ARE TOO MUCH. BUT THEN THE ARGUMENT. COMES DOWN TO IN BETWEEN FOLKS THAT ARE. OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. INSTEAD OF THEM BOTH BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY DO. AS FIGURING OUT WHERE ELSE WE CAN CUT SOME OF THE COSTS. SO. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE CONSTANTLY. CHALLENGES COMING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE ULTIMATELY TRYING TO PROVIDE SERVICE -- TO OUR RESIDENTS SORT TO US WHEN WE'RE IN TIME OF NEED SO -- I'M HAPPY. SO THAT SONG IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO SUPPORT AT THIS TODAY. BUT I'M. STILL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND I ASK YOU THAT TO WORK WITH -- WITH ALL SIDES TURN I APPRECIATE -- ONE YOUR QUESTION -- BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LET ME JUST -- SIMPLY SAY THIS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL SIDES AND THE OP WITH THE OPPOSITION -- IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN AND TO ALSO TRY TO STRIKE A BALANCE -- IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE TRIED THIS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BACK A MESSAGE -- WE WORKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- ON TO THAT PARTICULAR IN BUT ALSO WANT TO MAKE A POINT -- JUSTIN DOLLARS ON SOMETHING YOU INDICATED WE TRUST OUR PARAMEDICS ENOUGH FIREFIGHTERS WE CALL. NOTICE THEY THEIR RENDERING AND MAKING ASSESSMENTS WE TRUST THEM TO DO THAT WE TRUST THEM WHETHER SOMEONE. IS A GUNSHOT VICTIM WE TRUST THEM WHICH WAS THE NEXT PROBLEM MOTHERS OR FATHERS ARE HAVING A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE WE TRUST THEM. CAN WE TRUST THEM IF SOMEONE IS IS. INTOXICATED EITHER BY ALCOHOL OR DRUGS TO TAKE THEM TO A SOBERING CENTER CAN WE TRUST THEM ALSO SOMEONE IS HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN OR SUICIDAL TENDENCIES THAT SO THEY WON'T HAVE TO SIT INTO EMERGENCY ROOM. BUT THEY'LL BE TRANSPORTED TO A BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITY SO THEY GET THE SPECIALIZED ATTENTION THAT THEY NEED CAN WE TRUST THEM ENOUGH TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY WITH FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WE TRUST OUR PARAMEDICS WE TRUST OUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO RESPOND IN A MOMENT'S NOTICE. EVEN IT MEANS SECONDS A LIFE AND DEATH. SO THIS BILL DEMONSTRATES THAT THAT SAME KIND OF TRUSTS. AND WE'RE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. IN THAT REGARD [inaudible] MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YES ALSO WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR OVERSEE THAT I'M. I'M REALLY TORN ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION LAST YEAR. ON THE ISSUES REGARDING THE ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS -- BUT I THINK LOOKING BACK IN. MY CAR OF OVER THIRTY YEARS WORKING THE EMS INDUSTRY. I'VE ALWAYS TAUGHT WE DON'T DIAGNOSE RIGHT SO SOMETIME I HAVE A HEART ISSUE ONE WERE. ASKING OUR PARAMEDICS TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHERE WE TAKE SOMEBODY TO EMERGENCY ROOM OR TO A NON EMERGENT CENTER -- BECAUSE THEY COULD BE SOMEBODY SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR COULD BE INTOXICATED. AND SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL TORN THAT. WE'RE NOT DOCTORS AS PARAMEDICS RIGHT WERE WERE NOT THERE TO DIAGNOSE THAT THIS PERSON HAS THIS CONDITION IS THAT CONDITION WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PATIENT. I GET IT WE'RE TRYING TO ALLEVIATE THE CONGESTION IN HOSPITALS BECAUSE MANY THESE PATIENT DON'T NEED TO BE THAT WE WE GET IT IF THEY WOULD JUST FALL WITH THEIR DOCTORS AND DO THE MINOR THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE A LOT IN THE E. ARE SITTING BUT THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING. WE'RE GOING -- TO BUT MY BIGGEST ISSUE I'M HAVING AS THE POST DISCHARGE WHEN SOMEBODY IS BEING DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL. SOMEBODY WITH HOSPICE CARE. THAT -- FOR HAVING THAT THAT PARAMEDIC AS AS YOU ALLUDED TO THAT THEY'RE THERE TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN AND I GET THAT. BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH. OUR NURSES RIGHT BECAUSE TO ME. I'M NOT HERE. TO PICK SIDES BUT JUST LOOKING AT THE OVERALL ASPECT OF OF THE PROFESSION A PARAMEDIC AND NURSE THE NURSE INNOCENCE IS THE HIGHER MEDICAL AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THAT MORE TRAINING MORE EDUCATION. TO SEE THAT THAT TYPE OF PATIENT. GETTING THE TREE WITH THE FOLLOW UP CARE THAT SOMETIMES HARD FOR ME. TO TO TO THE GRAPHS THAT THE PARAMEDIC IS BETTER THAN THE NURSE BECAUSE THE NURSES USUALLY WHAT THEY NORMALLY DO THEY FOLLOW UP -- WITH PATIENTS ONCE THEY'RE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITALS. SO I'M I'M KIND OF TRANSFER TO HOW THIS WOULD WORK. I LIKE A BIT THAT IT WOULD BE IT'S NOT MANDATORY ITS REGULAR FOR EVERY COUNTY OR CITY TO DO IT'S IT'S AN OPTION WHICH WHICH I LIKE THAT BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THE HOW THE AGENCIES. WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR NURSES RIGHT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. WE ARE EXCLUDING THE NURSES FROM DOING THEIR JOB THAT WE HAVE IN A PARAMEDIC DOING THAT OR I KNOW DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING WITH NURSES TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE. CAN SOMEBODY ELABORATE TO ME ON THAT ASPECT OF THE CARE. I CAN SPEAK TO MY EXPERIENCE JUST -- IN THE WITH A POST DISCHARGE FEEL BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT SO AGAIN BACK TO THE POINT THAT I MADE -- EARLIER WE'RE NOT REPLICATING SERVICES WERE NOT ACTING OUTSIDE OF OUR PROTOCOLS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEHOLDEN TO ALL THE SAME PROTOCOL SO WE ARE WE'RE WORKING IN AND THEN I WANT CAPACITY. PROBABLY ALSO WORTH NOTING TO THAT IN MY POSITION RIGHT NOW I'M NOT I'M NOT PART OF SUPPRESSION THEY TOOK ME OFF OFF THE SUPPRESSION LINE I'M WORKING IN THE ADMIN POSITIONS WITH THE FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY -- THE TEN HOUR DAYS SO -- REALISTICALLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GO AND VISIT PEOPLE AFTER THEY'VE BEEN DISCHARGED AGAIN A LOT OF TIMES THESE ARE FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS TO HELP NOT WITH THE WITH THE YOU KNOW MEDICATION PICK UPS OR TO FOLLOW DOCTOR VISITS THINGS LIKE THAT -- SO WE'LL BE FOR WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DO IS WE WE FILL THESE GAPS AGAIN. THERE'S THERE'S A GAP THAT THAT HAPPENS NATURALLY BETWEEN WHEN A PATIENT IS DISCHARGED HOME TO WIN HOME HEALTH SERVICES START WHAT WE ATTEMPT TO DO IN THAT INTERIM IS BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SET UP FOR SUCCESS. SO IF THEY IF THEY HAVE DISTRICT MEDICATIONS UNFORTUNATELY OUR HOSPITAL IN ALAMEDA DOES NOT HAVE A DISCHARGE PHARMACY SO PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO PICK THEM UP ON THEIR OWN OR HAVE SOMEONE PICK THEM UP ON THEIR BEHALF -- SO WHAT WE DO IS WE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. ENSURE THAT THERE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN THAT THEY'RE TAKING IMPROPERLY. AND THEN BASICALLY MAKING SURE THEY'RE FOLLOWING UP AND LIKE I SAID TO OFTENTIMES ON THE ON MAKING FOLLOW UP CALLS TO THE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THESE FOLKS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING UP THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN I'M NOT THERE TO DO THE THINGS THAT THE NURSE THAT'S ASSIGNED TO THAT PERSON. IS DOING I'M SIMPLY THERE AGAIN TO BRIDGE THIS GAP TO HOPEFULLY ENSURE THAT THIS PERSON DOES NOT GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN AVOIDED. BY SIMPLY TAKING A MEDICATION OR MAKING A FOLLOW UP CALL OR IN IN SOME CASES EVEN JUST FOLLOWING UP WITH WITH THE HOME HEALTH AGENCY [inaudible] SO. I THINK A LOT MORE CLEAR YEAH MAKES LEVEL MORE SENSE SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TAKING. A UNIT THAT'S PRIMARILY ORDERED DO NOT ONE CALLS WERE WERE HAVING SOMEBODY -- AN EXTRA UNIT OR AN ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE DOUBTS ALL THEIR JOB IS TO DO. THOSE FOLLOW UPS WITH THOSE PAGES THAT ARE BEING DISCHARGED -- I I GET THAT I FEEL A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT -- BUT ALSO WANTED TO COLLABORATE MORE ON THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT SOME PILOT PROGRAMS STUDIES THAT THE OUTCOMES WEREN'T AS GOOD IS THERE ANY FEEDBACK THAT TIME WE CAN TALK ABOUT. WHAT THEIR TALKED ABOUT I KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT THESE PUBLIC PROGRAM TO SEEM TO BE WORKING FINE BUT WHAT ABOUT? THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SEEM TO HAVE SOME ISSUES WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING TO FIX THAT THAT THAT. THOSE PUBLIC PROGRAMS ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WHY THAT HAPPENED IN MAKING SURE THAT. THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER THAN WHAT. THEY SPOKE. TO OF THANK YOU MISTER RODRIGUEZ -- SO THE BUTTE COUNTY PILOTS. INITIALLY HAD DATA CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE OPPOSITION. THAT THE READMISSION RATES DID NOT CHANGE AND SOME TASTE CASES THAT INCREASED AND THEY ARE FOCUSED ON COMPLEX. MEDICAL ISSUES AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BUTTE COUNTY PILOT IS THE THE THE LOCALS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE AGENCY. REVIEWED THE PROTOCOLS IN DETERMINED THAT THE PROTOCOLS WHEN APPROPRIATE THE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING AN IN PERSON VISIT VERSUS A PHONE CALL. THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THESE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PILOT PROJECTS IS. TO TEST THE THEORY AND MAKE SURE AND CERTAIN THAT THE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE BEING OPERATED UNDER ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE FOR THE PATIENTS THAT THEY ARE SERVING SO IN THAT CASE THE PROTOCOLS WERE ADJUSTED. AND I THINK THERE IS MORE DATA FORTHCOMING ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS SUCCESSFUL -- BUT IN ALL CASES THIS BILL MISTER GIBSON'S BILL VERY APPROPRIATELY SUGGESTS THAT THERE SHOULD BE DOCTORS NURSES AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE DETERMINING WHAT THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE FOR THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM THAT WILL APPLY STATE WIDE SO THAT WE WILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE BEST PROTOCOLS TO SERVE THESE PATIENTS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR LEVERING WITH THAT AS WELL LIKE I SAID EARLIER I'M I'M STILL WARN ABOUT THE ISSUE. I KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO BRUSH ADDRESSED THE ISSUE WITH PATIENT CARE AND AND THAT EMERGENCY SENDING -- I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT MANDATED BY EVERY COUNTY TO DO THAT -- I'M STILL HAVING ISSUES ON HOW I GUESS WOULD BE UP TO THE COUNTIES TO COME UP WITH THESE ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS RIGHT. THE TYPE OF PERSON THEY'LL BE WORKING THERE. AND MAKING SURE THAT -- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PATIENTS TREATED AT THE BEST PRICE POSSIBLE WHERE THERE'S THE ER OR THAT. ALTERNATE DESTINATION -- SOME LEVERAGE A HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON THIS I I AM VERY STRUGGLING TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE WORK THEM ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND AND I'M GONNA JUST RESERVE MY RIGHT WHETHER I SUPPORT THIS BILL. IF IT GETS TO THE FLOOR SO ONCE AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE JUST WANNA KICK. MAKE SURE CONTINUE A DIALOGUE WITH OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE SOME VALID POINTS ON THEIR END AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE DRUDGERY GUESS LET ME SAY I TRUST YOU. I TRUST YOUR SKILL I TRUST YOU IF I WERE TO FALL OUT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN RENDER AID. AND MAKE SURE THAT I'M TAKING CARE OF BECAUSE YOUR EXPERTISE. I TRUST THE PARAMEDICS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO DO LIKEWISE TO SOMEONE WHO'S UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NARCOTICS SOMEONE WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OF ALCOHOL AND SOMEONE WHO IS BREAKING DOWN -- SUICIDAL TO GET THAT INDIVIDUAL -- TO A CENTERS THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY HANDLE AND ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR NEED INSTEAD OF BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOM FOR HOURS. AND THEY NOT BEING SEEN. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I JUST -- THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION THAT'S ONE THING I I I KNOW I THIS FEELS A LITTLE LIKE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD LAST YEAR.

THE ACCOUNT WILL FUND EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT OF YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THIS PHONE IS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY A DH CS IN COLLABORATION WITH CD AND CD PH. YOU WITH ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND DRUG USE IS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. TAXES GENERATED THROUGH THE LEGAL SALE OF CANVAS PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS SUBSTANCE ABUSE BY YOUTH. EARLY ESTIMATES BY THE LA -- SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE IT'S NOT THERE YET BUT THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE. HOWEVER PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WAS SILENT ON CERTAIN CRITICAL FACTORS. THIS BILL PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE YOUTH ACCOUNT. IT CREATES A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO ADVISE THE THREE AGENCIES ON DATA COLLECTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND REPORTING. IT ALSO REQUIRES MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AND REDUCING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS BILL FIRST SPECIFIES THAT PROGRAMS FUNDED MUST BE EVIDENCE BASED. FINALLY THE BILL REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE EXPENDITURES AND OUT COMES THROUGH REGULAR REPORTING THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS GENERATED THROUGH THE TAXES. ON THE LEGAL SALE OF CANNABIS ARE USED IN AN EFFECTIVE. MANNER. JOINING ME TODAY IS THE COLOR OF I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN ME MISTER WOULD BUT YOU ARE CO AUTHOR I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

NINE VOTES OF BILLS OUT WE LEAVE IT UP THE ROLE OF THE BROTHER SAT ON THINK SO MUCH MISTER AND MISTER O'DONNELL MISTER TING. THANK YOU MISTER HERE TO PRESENT AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR FIRST THANK YOU FOR SO JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE THE CONSULTING THE CHAIR. FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS THE BILL ESTABLISHES SOME BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR GROCERY DELIVERIES THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS. WE KNOW THERE'S SOME INITIAL OPPOSITION WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WE KNOW WE'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY. AND WITH THAT -- RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DANIEL CURRY INTO MY I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. I'M HERE REPRESENTING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND MEMBERS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY AB THIRTEEN SIXTY AIMS TO PROTECT. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CONSUMERS AND WORKERS BY EXTENDING EXISTING REGULATIONS THAT ALREADY APPLY TO FOOD RETAILERS. A GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS ORDER GROCERIES ONLINE AND HAVE THEM DELIVERED. DIRECTLY TO THEIR HOME. TO PROVIDE THIS LABOR INTENSIVE SERVICE FOOD RETAILERS. I FREQUENTLY RELYING ON ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS. FOOD RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT REGULATIONS REGARDING THE HANDLING OF FOOD TO PROTECT CONSUMER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY. DELIVERY COMPANIES EXPOSED CONSUMER GOODS TO THE SOME OF THE SAME RISKS THAT MAY ARISE WITH FOOD RETAILER. YET THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. THIS LACK OF REGULATION IS PARTICULARLY GRAVE AS DELIVERY PLATFORM DRIVERS. USE PERSONAL VEHICLES TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES. DELIVERY PLATFORM [inaudible] OKAY. CAN I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS OKAY SIR. ANY ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SORRY MR CHAIRMAN TWEENER MY NAME'S TERESA BURKE **** ON BEHALF OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS -- WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO IDENTIFY LOCAL RETAIL FOOD CODE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORKING WITH HIM. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COURT IN JENSEN WITH TECH NET HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN SIXTY AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE ALL MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF FOOD. FIRST LET ME SAY THAT FOOD SAFETY AND CUSTOMER TRUST AND SAFETY IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR TECHNICS MEMBER COMPANIES AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR RETAIL AND GROCERY PARTNERS. THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED FOOD AT RISK BASED FOOD SAFETY MEASURES APPROPRIATE FOR THE POTENTIAL FOOD SAFETY RISKS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE THAT WE BELIEVE IS CONVERSATIONS ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP REGARDING WORKER CLASSIFICATION BILLS LIKE THESE CREATE CONFLICT AND CONFUSION THAT WILL NOT HELP IN COMING TO A SOLUTION TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES TO RE ENGINEER THEIR PLATFORMS AND EXERT MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR DRIVERS WHICH COULD PUT THESE COMPANIES IN CONFLICT WITH CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR LAWS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SINGLES OUT THE CALIFORNIA GROCERY INDUSTRY IN CRATES POTENTIAL UNNECESSARY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD REDUCE THE EARNING POTENTIAL OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT SMALL BUSINESSES. LET ME JUST QUICKLY EXPLAIN HOW THESE PLATFORMS WORK THERE ARE TWO BASIC MODELS FIRST FOR MANY GROCERY DELIVERY ORDERS A CUSTOMER SUBMITS AN ORDER THE GROCERY STORE AND A GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE ASSEMBLES THE ORDER THAN A DRIVER. WORKING ON THE PLATFORM PICKS UP THE ORDER AND DELIVERS IT TO THE CUSTOMER THE DRIVER NEVER TOUCHES ARE HANDLES THE FOOD. I CAN'T FOR OTHER ORDERS A SHOPPER GOES THE GROCERY STORE PICKS UP THE GROCERIES IN THE SAME WAY A CUSTOMER DOES AND THEN DIRECTLY DELIVERS THE GROCERIES TO THE CUSTOMERS. FOR THESE ORDERS A SHOPPER ACTS EXACTLY LIKE A CUSTOMER WOULD GOING TO GROCERY STORE PICKING OUT YOUR PRODUCE PICKING OUT YOUR PRE PACKAGED SERIAL AND SHIPS AND THEN PAYING FOR YOUR GROCERIES AND TRANSPORTING THEM TO THE CUSTOMER'S HOME. SO FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE DELIVERY DRIVERS TO OBTAINING FOOD HANDLER CARD. NOT EVEN GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A FOOD HANDLER CARD ONLY THESE EMPLOYEES ONLY THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT PREPARE AND SERVE FOOD. THE PROCESS OF GETTING A FOOD HANDLER CARD IS BURDENSOME BOTH IN TIME AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT BE ON USING THESE PLATFORMS WERE AS FEW HOURS A WEEK. THE AVERAGE IS USUALLY ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HOURS A WEEK -- IT REQUIRES TAKING A NINETY MINUTE COURSE AND THEN PASSING A FORTY QUESTION TEST FOCUS ON HOW FOOD SHOULD BE PREPARED AND SERVED IN A RESTAURANT OR AT A KITCHEN AND DALY OF A GROCERY STORE. THE INTENT OF THE FOOD HANDLER CARD WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR WORKERS AT RESTAURANTS AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE FOOD IS BEING PREPARED AND SERVED WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR DRIVERS WHO ARE SIMPLY COLLECTING AND DELIVERING PACKAGE PRODUCTS TO A CONSUMER. AND QUICKLY I KNOW IT'S GETTING PAID THERE'S JUST A LOT IN THIS BILL THAT I'D. LIKE TO COVER BUT I'M JUST ANOTHER ONE FINAL POINT I'LL MAKE AB THIRTEEN SIXTY WOULD ALSO MAKE DELIVERY DRIVERS AND PLATFORMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. INCLUDING FULL FOOD HOLDING AREAS AND FOOD PACKAGING THOSE PROVISIONS ARE WRITTEN FOR FOOD DELIVERY FROM MANUFACTURERS AND OR DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL LOCATIONS SO AS AN EXAMPLE ASKING THE FOOD HOLDING AREA OF THE VEHICLES TO BE CONSTRUCTED OF A SMOOTH THE WASHABLE IMPERVIOUS MATERIAL CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING FREQUENT CLEANING. ONE DAY OUT OF THE ELIMINATE THIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S MANY OTHER PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT I'M AND I JUST WRAP UP BY SAYING OUR MEMBER COMPANIES PROVIDE TO THEIR SHOPPERS INFORMATION THEY NEED TO SAFELY PERFORM THEIRWORK. AND TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHILE NOT OVER BURDENING THEM WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AND TRYING TO FIT THIS INDUSTRY INTO A BOX THEY DO NOT FIT IN WILL STIFLE INNOVATION HARM CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU AND WE ASK FOR KNOW ABOUT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEC KAREN SARKISIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHERE POST. IDEAL FOUNTAIN I JUST PERSONAL I'M -- HEPATITIS A SURVIVOR -- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION -- THE BILL DOES NOT DO ANYTHING -- TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING SEEING NONE -- THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES HERE. IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED -- AND QUITE A QUITE HONESTLY A LITTLE -- A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THAN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AGAIN I JUST RESPECT US FOR I'VE -- WE BELIEVE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE -- INSURER -- SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS THAT ARE CONSISTENT -- WE KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FROM THE FIRST TIME THAT THE FOOD GETS DELIVERED GROCERY STORE TO THE TIME THE FOOD GETS INTO SOMEONE'S. A POSITION THAT THAT IS HANDLED CONSISTENTLY AND ACROSS THE SAME FOR SO RESPECTFULLY I STRIVE VOTE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK CAN BE STILL WITH US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR TING THE BILL -- WE WE HAVE A MOTION. WE DO NOT HAVE A MOTION -- WE DON'T HAVE MOTION YES YOU CAN SECOND IF YOU WANT WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER ROBERTS THE SECOND BY MISTER IN THIS AREA. OF THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO TO JUST YEAR -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHATI'VE WHEN I MAYES SNOW MAYES NO AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I BIGELOW SORRY. BIGELOW NO BONTA [inaudible] BURKE. WICKS FLORA. FLORA NO AMOUNT. MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN. NAZARIAN AYE RAMOS ROSS I RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON. SEVENTY ONE GIVE SEVEN WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MR WENT AB EIGHT TWO TWO WOULD ALLOW HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF NEW BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS AND DEVICES. CALIFORNIA. IS THE ONLY STATES. THAT REQUIRES FULL BOTTOM IS TO USE NEEDLES TO DRAW BLOOD ADVANCEMENTS IN MEDICINE PROVIDE FOR SAFER AND NEEDLE LESS BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS CALIFORNIA PATIENTS DESERVE ACCESS TO A NEW MEDICAL PRACTICE TO NEWPORT MEDICAL PRACTICES THAT ARE SAFE AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE. JUST IMAGINE SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL. WITH AN IV IN YOUR ARM AND HAVING TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWN EVERY FEW HOURS. THIS SOLVES THAT ISSUE I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT ANY NEW DEVICES OR METHODS MUST BE FDA APPROVED HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS DR. HE TO DIVIDE THE DEAD GONE OF A LOT OF VASCULAR AND DOCTOR FRED BROWN OF GRIFFIN HEALTH. GET THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR P. TO DEBORAH AND I'M A CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER IT BELONG -- VASCULAR WERE SAN FRANCISCO BASED MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY. I'M ALSO THE INVENTOR OF ARE FDA CLEARED NEIL FREE BLOOD DRAWING TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS CALLED PECO. PECO IS A SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE DEVICE THE TEMPORAL CONNECTS TO HOSPITALIZE PATIENTS IV CATHETER. TO ENABLE VIRTUALLY PAINLESS AND RELIABLE BLOOD COLLECTION. HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA ARE ADOPTING IV CATHETER BLOOD COLLECTION WITH PEABO TO IMPROVE THEIR PATIENTS EXPERIENCE BY ELIMINATING PAINFUL NEEDLE STICKS. REDUCE THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL NEEDLE STICK OR NEEDLE STICK OR SHARPS INJURIES FOR THEIR STAFF IMPROVE LABORATORY EFFICIENCY BY REDUCING THE HOSPITAL'S REJECTED SAMPLE RATE. AND LASTLY IN HIGHER ACUITY POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY TO REDUCE THE NEED TO ACCESS THEIR PATIENTS HIGHER RISK CENTRAL LINES ARE PLANTED PORTS THE INCREASE THE RISK FOR INFECTION. THERE'S ROBUST EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE USE OF PEOPLE WHEN I BE CAPITA BLOOD COLLECTION THERE'S FOR PEER REVIEWED PUBLISHED JOURNAL ARTICLES A DEMONSTRATED FIRST LABS COLLECTED WITH PEOPLE ARE EQUIVALENT TO BEING A PUNCTURE. SECOND USING PEOPLE DOES NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE IV CATHETER LIFE AND THIRD USING PEOPLE CAN REDUCE POOR QUALITY SAMPLES WHICH TRANSLATES INTO LESS REPEAT REPEATED TESTING. AND IMPROVED HOSPITAL WORKFLOW. IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE PEOPLE USES ABOUT THE CROSS OVER ONE MILLION IN PATIENT DRAWS CONDUCTED SO FAR SINCE ORIGINAL FDA CLEARANCE. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY TRAIN FOR BOTTOM THIS AND OTHER STATES. THERE'S BEEN ZERO I REPEAT ZERO ADVERSE EVENTS EVER REPORTED AFTER MILLION DROSS. AS A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE LIKE TO SHARE SOME WERE CONDUCTED BY INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTH TO MEASURE PEOPLE'S IMPACT ON THEIR CARE. INTERMOUNTAIN IS THE LARGEST HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN UTAH WITH TWENTY THREE HOSPITALS ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 50% OF THE INPATIENT BEDS IN THE STATE. LIKE MOST LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS THEY RELY ON THEIR FULL BOTTOM IS TO COLLECT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR IN PATIENT BLOOD SAMPLES. DAVID UP THE PEOPLE SYSTEM WIDE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. THE TRACK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DRAWS ON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND TRACK THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL IV CATHETERS. THIS IS THE LARGEST DATASET INVESTOR ACCESS EVER BROUGHT COLLECTED. THEIR FINDINGS FROM THE DATA SAID INCLUDE NO CHANGE AN IV CATHETER REPLACEMENT RATES WHEN FOR BOTTOMS ARE USING PICO A 40% REDUCTION IN SAMPLE REJECTION RATES WHEN USING PICO. AND THEY ALSO REMOVED A QUARTER OF A MILLION INPATIENT NEEDLES FROM THERE IN PATIENT CARE ENVIRONMENTS. PATIENT SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT SEND THIS NEW PROCEDURE STILL HAS NURSING IN FULL CONTROL OF THE PATIENT'S ID CARE. IF INFUSION IS RUNNING THROUGH AN IV CATHETER WHEN A BLOOD DRAWS REQUIRED THE PATIENT'S NURSE DECIDES IT BRIEFLY PAUSING THE INFUSION IS APPROPRIATE. AND IF SO THE NURSE WOULD FLUSH THE IV LINE BEFORE THE BOTTOM ASST DRAWS THE PATIENT'S BLOOD HUSING PEOPLE. THIS COORDINATION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM IS A NURSING IS NOT NEW AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED TODAY WHICH ADDITIONAL BLOOD DRAWS. TO BE CLEAR OF THE BOTTOMS WILL NEVER START STOP PAUSE ANY RUNNING INFUSION NOR WILL THEY BE INSERTING OR REMOVING ANY IV CATHETERS PERIOD. LASTLY. ALL THE BOTTOM IS THE NURSES COMPLETE IN PERSON TRAINING AND DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. SO IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE MAJORITY BLOOD DRAWS ARE CONDUCTED TODAY BY FOUR BOTTOM MISSED AND THIS BILL WILL ENABLE THEM TO UTILIZE SAFER AND MORE HUMANE NEW TECHNOLOGY. TO DRAW BLOOD FOR HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS I VERGE I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI SIR. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR FRED BROWN I'M CURRENTLY THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER VICE PRESIDENT MEDICAL AFFAIRS IN PRACTICING CLINICIAN AT GRIFFIN HEALTH INTERVIEW CONNECTICUT. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO TESTIFY TODAY AND SHARE MY HOSPITAL'S EXPERIENCE WITH IMPLEMENTING PO. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ARE THE LONGEST RUNNING PEOPLE HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY. OUR HOSPITAL IS A LEADER IN THE PATIENT CENTERED CARE MOVEMENT AND WE ARE THE HOME OF PLANE TREE. A NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PERSONALIZING HUMANA HUMANA ISING. AND DEMYSTIFYING HEALTHCARE. WHEN WE LEARNED OF PEOPLE DEVICE WHICH WAS EVEN BEFORE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE SAW AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR HOSPITAL TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE HOW OUR PATIENTS EXPERIENCE CLUB? BUT COLLECTIONS. WHAT DRAWING FOR LABORATORY TESTING USING TRADITIONAL VENA PUNCTURE? IS OFTEN PERFORMED ON HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. IT IS A VERY BIG TO SOUTHWIRE. WE HAVE YET TO FIND ANYONE WHO IS PRO NEEDLE AN ORGANIZATION. WE IMPLEMENTED PEOPLE WHEN OUR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WHICH WAS LED BY OUR ICE YOU NURSES. THEY BECAME PEOPLE EXPERTS QUICKLY AND PATIENT SATISFACTION WAS IMMEDIATE AND OBVIOUS. SOON AFTER WE DECIDED TO CONVERT OUR ENTIRE HOSPITAL PEOPLE DRIES DROSS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT SINCE BLOOD DRYING IS PERFORMED BY PHLEBOTOMY TRAINED SPECIALISTS IN THE MAJORITY OF OUR HOSPITAL. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE TRAINED TO USE PPO DEVICE OTHERWISE THE TASK OF BLOOD DRYING WILL BE ADDED TO THE WORK LOAD OF OUR NURSES. THE FEEDBACK FROM OUR NURSE COLLEAGUES. WHO ARE USING THE P. VOTE DEVICE BELIEVE FOR BOTTOM MISSED COULD SAFELY PERFORMER PEOPLE DRAW WHICH THEY PERCEIVED TO BE LESS TECHNICALLY DEMANDING THAT HAVE BEEN A PUNCTURE? OUR MEDICAL SURGICAL NURSES ALSO INDICATED THAT WITH AN ASSIGNMENT OF FOUR TO SIX PATIENTS TAKING ON RESPONSIBLY FOR BLOOD DRAWING WAS TOO BURDENSOME. AND PREFERRED THE PHLEBOTOMY SPECIALS CONTINUE COLLECTING BLOOD SAMPLES. THE NURSES EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO PRACTICE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LICENSE IN FOCUS ON PATIENT ASSESSMENT. MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND DIRECT PATIENT CARE NOT I'M BLOOD COLLECTION. WE LAUNCHED PEOPLE ACROSS OUR ENTIRE HOSPITAL LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PERFORMED OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DRAWS WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE ADVERSE EVENT. SIMILAR TO ALL OF THE OTHER HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE ADOPTED PVO. GRIFFIN HAS A STRICT POLICY THAT THE BOTTOM ASSN TECHNICIANS PERFORMING PEOPLE BLOOD DRAWS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO STOP OR RESTART ANY IV INFUSIONS. THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE NURSES RESPONSIBILITY. MOST BY COLLECTIONS IN CONNECTICUT AND CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS AS WELL AS HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY IS PERFORMED BY FULL BONDESON TECHNICIANS. CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR BLOOD COLLECTION PERSONNEL WHO UNLIKE IN MOST OTHER STATES ARE LICENSE. AND THEREFORE HAVE A HIGH STANDARD OF PRACTICE TO IMPLEMENT A STAT SAFER AND MORE PATIENT CENTERED APPROACH IN PATIENT BLOOD DRYING. THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI ON AB. EIGHT TWENTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT THEIR OPPOSITION GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND CURTIS L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G JUNIOR WITH&lt;/c&gt; THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA. SEE IN A STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE. OF LABORATORY PER BOTTOM MISS AND PERMIT THEM TO ACCESS INDWELLING. INTRAVENOUS CATHETERS. IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS FOR THE% PURPOSE OF WOULD JOIN BLOOD. FROM PATIENTS RECEIVING FUSION THERAPY. CNA PROPOSES THIS LEGISLATION FOR THREE PRIMARY REASONS. FIRST THE INSERTION OF INTRAVENOUS CATHETERS THE POST INSERTION CARE OF THE INTERVENES -- INSERTION CATHETERS AND THE SITE. IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTRAVENOUS INFUSIONS IS THE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE DIRECT CARE REGISTERED NURSE IN COULD NOT BE DELEGATED. TO AN UNLICENSED PERSONNEL. THE INSERTION OF INTRAVENOUS CATHETER INTO A PATIENT CREATES A PATHWAY DIRECTLY INTO -- THE VENOUS VENOUS BLOOD STREAM. IT REQUIRES EXTREME TECHNIQUE BOTH FOR THE INSERTION AND FOR THE POST INSERTION MANAGEMENT OF THE CATHETER. AND THE CATHETER INSERTION SITE IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INFECTION. OR THE INTRODUCTION OF BACTERIA DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM. SECONDLY A CAREFUL READING OF THE CURRENT STATUTORY LANGUAGE REGARDING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CERTIFIED. PHLEBOTOMY TECHNICIAN. DEMONSTRATES THAT NOTHING IN THE LANGUAGE. THE C. P. TEASE BUT THE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF PERIPHERALLY INSERTED IVY'S. CB TEAS ARE TRAINED TO USE NEEDLES TO PUNCTURE THE SKIN AND TO WITHDRAW BLOOD FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. CPT TRAIN DOES NOT INCLUDE STOPPING IV INFUSIONS FLUSHING CATHETERS ORIENT STARTING THE IV INCLUSION INFUSION AFTER BLOOD HAS BEEN DRAWN. LASTLY THIS BILL POSES A THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS TO ITS EFFORT TO THE SKILL. A CENTRAL FUNCTION A PROFESSIONAL NURSING PRACTICE. ACCORDINGLY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. FOR AB. EIGHT TWENTY TWO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP RIGHT HERE ON THE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS AND THE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIA -- I WOULD JUST ECHO MY COLLEAGUE CURTIS -- WE SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT -- FULL BODY MISTER I'M LICENSE PERSON NOW AND THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING TO WHICH IT WHICH IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW AND SCOPE OF A NURSE AND IF SOMETHING WERE TO GO LOOK WRONG IF THERE WAS AN INFECTION. IF THE MAIN LINE WAS KNOCKED OUT ON BY THE FULL BOTTOM IS PERFORMING THE BLOOD DRIVE. THAT WOULD -- BE BE REFLECTED ON THE LIGHT AT THE NURSES LICENSE AND THAT WE WE FIND THAT HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC THANK YOU. OTHERS UP TO SHOULD JUST IN NAME AND POSITION ORGANIZATION. SURE SURE MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE POINT FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV AND AIDS OR IN THE HOSPITAL -- THEY ARE IN A PARTICULARLY ACUTE STAGE OF THEIR CONDITION I'M HAVING A CHANGE ON THE DELIVERY OF THEIR CARE SUCH AS THIS BILL ENVISIONS COULD ACTUALLY BE TROUBLING FOR THAT POPULATION FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH THIS YEAR YOU CALIFORNIA WE'RE AT A NEUTRAL POSITION RIGHT NOW -- OUR ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS BOTH FULL BOTTOM IS ANDERSON SO WE HEAR YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THAT SPONSORED TO WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JAZZY GIRL WITH THE OF CW WESTERN STATES COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS LIZ ALLAN ALMOND DISABLED PATIENT IS AT A CENTRAL LNE -- NEUTRAL POSITION JUST WANT YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL PAIN TO HAVE A NEEDLE AND THE CENTRAL LINE AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU ALRIGHT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING TO GO FORWARD -- ON BEHALF. PATIENCE I I BELIEVE I HEARD FROM THE FOR THE SPONSOR THE SPONSORS YOUR YOUR YOUR FOLKS ON THE SIDE YOU HAD A MILLION BLOOD DRAWS WITH NO ADVERSE REACTIONS. WHAT WILL CROSS THE NECKLACE ARE? WE SHOULD CROSS THAT IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO YEAH COUPLE HUNDRED IT'S PROBABLY AROUND EIGHT OR NINE OR THOUSAND SO FAR BUT HALF OF THOSE WERE DONE BY THE BOTTOMS. NO COMPLAINTS FROM THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE THE BLOOD DRAWN THIS WENT. YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PRO NEEDLE NOW. YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW AS A AS A AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THINGS CHANGE AND TECHNOLOGIES EMERGE AND THAT DOES OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON PATIENT CARE -- IN THIS ONE TO ME FEELS LIKE A VERY POSITIVE EFFECT ON PATIENT CARE -- AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT SUPPORT THE BILL SUPPORT THE AUTHOR IN THIS -- I'D I THINK THAT INNOVATION IS A GOOD THING. AND I THINK OF IT -- INC IT INCREASES THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE FOR THE PATIENT AND DOESN'T HAVE AN ADVERSE SIDE EFFECT -- I'M. GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPTION TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROVIDING CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS AND PATIENTS WITH A SAFER OPTION TO AVOID BLACK AND BLUE ARMS FROM MULTIPLE NEEDLE STICKS. AND JUST TO CLARIFY. THIS BILL DOES NOT AUTHORIZE A FULL BOTTOM IS TO INSERT REMOVE OR MANAGE AN IV. AND I WILL CLARIFY THAT FURTHER IF NECESSARY WHEN THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO THE END. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOUGH.

TWENTY TWO AB NINE TWENTY TWO AND AND THEN MISTER HIS HEARING WILL BE A TWELVE OR NOT. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH ME ON THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH I'VE AGREED TO TAKE INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF A FOUR YEAR SUNSET. I AB NINE TWENTY TWO PROMOTES MEDICAL RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA WINE WHILE ENSURING RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS ARE FAIRLY TREATED BY REMOVING THE PROHIBITION ON COMPENSATION FOR WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN A DONATION FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE BILL. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WOMEN ARE TREATED EQUALLY TO ALL OF THE RESEARCH SUBJECTS ALLOWING THEM TO ACTIVELY EVALUATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH STUDIES AND TO BE PAID FOR THEIR TIME TROUBLE INC INCONVENIENCE WHILE THEY DO PARTICIPATE. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF EMPOWERING WOMEN TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA DITIONS STOP WHEN IT COMES TO PARTICIPATING RESEARCH. NO ONE TAKES A DONATION LIGHTLY ASSISTED US AYE PRODUCTION TAKES TIME AND COMMITMENT TO A RIGOROUS HOME ON PER PROTOCOL. AND DISCOMFORT THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT IT'S A PROCESS THAT I KNOW FIRST HAND I'VE GONE THROUGH IVF I WOULDN'T HAVE MY DAUGHTER ISABELLA WITHOUT IT. I BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANCE AND RESEARCH THAT HAVE MADE FERTILITY TREATMENTS EASIER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL. WHEN I FIRST STARTED FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS THIRTEEN YEARS AGO? THE HORMONE INJECTIONS WERE DIFFERENT THE PROCESS WAS DIFFERENT. TODAY TREATMENT IS MORE TAILORED WE NOW HAVE OPTIONS FOR FERTILITY THAT PRINT PRESERVE WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY IT PRESERVATION OF EMBRYOS AND MORE EFFECTIVE PRENATAL CARE. ALL OF THESE ADVANCES IN TREATMENT ARE DUE TO ADVANCE RESEARCH. WE HAVE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PROTECTION TO GUARD AGAINST THE EXPLOITATION OF DONORS WE HAVE THOROUGH LAWS REGULATIONS AND CONFORM TO CONSENT PROCEDURES. WE HAVE HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH PANELS AND INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS ENSURE THAT PARTICIPANTS ARE SCREENED AND INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF TREATMENTS. THESE ARE PROCESSES THAT WE TRUST TO PROTECT EVERY OTHER RESEARCH PARTICIPATE. AND A FULLY EXTENT EIGHT DONORS. REMOVING THE BAN ON COMPENSATION ALLOWS EGG DONORS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RESEARCH PARTICIPANT TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON PARTICIPATION AND TO BE APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED -- WITH ME I I HAVE A WITNESSES THAT WILL INTRODUCE THEMSELVES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THE GERMAN WOULDN'T AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS MARCEL CEDARS -- BUT THE BOARD CERTIFIED REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY AND INFERTILITY AT UCSF MEDICAL CENTER. AS I WORKED WITH PATIENTS UNDERGOING THESE PROCEDURES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I CAN SPEAK WITH SOME AUTHORITY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED THE POTENTIAL RISKS. AND HOW TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH I DO ON A DAILY BASIS HAS CLEARED DIRECT AND POTENTIALLY IMMEDIATE CLINICAL IMPLICATION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MY PATIENTS. AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT COMPENSATION WE CANNOT OBTAIN -- SITES TO DO THE RESEARCH THAT ONE DAY WILL IMPROVE MEDICAL CARE FOR WOMEN. OVARIAN STIMULATION AND SITE RETRIEVAL IS A TIME CONSUMING AND ARDUOUS PROCESS THE TIME COMMITMENT FOR ONE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION CYCLE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT FIFTY SIX HOURS. AND INCLUDES MEDICAL SCREENING AND MONITORING INTERVIEWS IN COUNSELING BLOOD TESTS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROCEDURES. THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE HAS CONSIDERED THE ISSUE OF COMPENSATION FOR DONORS. AND HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT COMPENSATION IS WARRANTED AND ETHICAL. OUR ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION DOES NOT CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE AND USE OF THE DONATION WHETHER TO HELP CREATE A FAMILY OR TO BE USED IN RESEARCH WHICH ULTIMATELY MAY HELP MILLIONS. BUT IN CALIFORNIA COMPENSATION IS PROHIBITED ESSENTIALLY CLOSING OFF RESEARCH THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE DONE BY OUR WORLD RENOWNED SCIENTISTS AND INSTITUTIONS. WE ARE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES THAT HAS SUCH A BAN. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESEARCH GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPANT SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR TIME TROUBLE AND INCONVENIENCE STEMMING FROM RESEARCH RELATED PROCEDURES. ADDITIONALLY EVERY MEDICAL PROCEDURE COMES AT WITH SOME LEVEL OF RISK. OVARIAN STIMULATION RETRIEVAL ARE STANDARD MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND IN THE LAST YEAR THIS PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TIMES GLOBALLY. NEW OVULATION INDUCTION STRATEGIES ARE THOUGHT TO ALL BUT ELIMINATE THE COMPLICATION OF OVARIAN HYPER STIMULATION SYNDROME AND STUDIES REGARDING CANCER RISK HAVE BEEN LARGELY REASSURING. AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST OVARIAN OR UTERINE CANCER ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROCEDURES. ALL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS IS REVIEWED BY AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD WHOSE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS FROM UNDUE RISK AN INFLUENCE. IT IS ALSO THE JOB OF THESE REVIEW BOARDS TO SET COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS. THERE IS NO REASON THAT THIS ESTABLISHED POLICY OF OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT -- FOR SITE DONATION TO SCIENCE. RATHER THAN OTHER TYPES OF RESEARCH FURTHERMORE ANY RESEARCH THAT IT INVOLVES REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES MUST ALSO UNDERGO. EXCUSE ME AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY A SEPARATE COMMITTEE OF SCIENTISTS ETHICISTS AND LAYPERSONS. LASTLY IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED -- FOR SITES FOR RESEARCH IN ADDITION TO USE AND STEM CELL RESEARCH THERE IS A NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BASIC AG DEVELOPMENT AND MATURITY. AND A VERY AN AGING IMPROVING OUR KNOWLEGE ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT MAY IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR INFERTILITY AND ALLOW PROTECTION OF THE FREE FROM TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS NOT CRYSTAL OFF AND I AM CO OF OF IT RESEARCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING ACCESS TO OTHER SITES -- FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. I BELIEVE THERE IS VERY BIG POTENTIAL TO MAKE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES MUCH EASIER MUCH HEALTHIER AND MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE FOR MANY MILLIONS OF WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHY THANK ADOPTING THIS LAWS IMPORTANT TO THAT. THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CASE OF CASES OF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION OCCURRING PER YEAR IN THE U. S. COSTING ON AVERAGE TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PER PROCEDURE. AND USUALLY BEING PAID DIRECTLY BY THE PATIENT. RIGHT NOW PATIENTS MYSELF IN JACK'S TEN FIFTEEN HORMONE INJECTIONS BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THE PROCEDURE. THESE INJECTIONS CAN BE UNPLEASANT RESULTING AND USUALLY AND USUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BLOATING AND SWELLING. BUT THERE'S CLEAR PROMISE TO DEVELOP A WAY WHERE MOST WOMEN WOULD NOT REQUIRE THESE HORMONE INJECTIONS IF WE FURTHER DEVELOP PROMISING RESEARCH. THE ORGANIZATION I RUN IS A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THAT'S TRYING TO DEVELOP THE WAY FOR WOMEN TO NOT NEED HORMONE INJECTIONS PRIOR TO DOING IVF. AND RIGHT NOW IT'S FAR TOO HARD TO DO OUR RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE NEEDED TO SHE IS. TO TEST OUR WORK WE NEED TO WORK WITH EGGS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO HORMONE INJECTIONS AND WE CAN'T JUST GET -- SITES LEFT OVER FROM FERTILITY TREATMENTS AS THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED THE MEDICATIONS WERE TRYING TO AVOID. THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THE NEEDED TISSUES IS TO COMPENSATE WOMEN FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION AND DONATIONS CYCLES. WITHOUT ACCESS TO EX WE CAN'T DEVELOP THIS RESEARCH AND PERPETUATES THE INABILITY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND COUPLES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ORGANIZATION IS NOT UNIQUE IN BEING LIMITED ON PURSING PROMISING RESEARCH INCREASE CARE. THERE ARE MANY OTHER ACADEMIC PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEING STYMIED FROM DOING MEANINGFUL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD TREMENDOUSLY BENEFIT WHEN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO POPULATIONS ACCOUNT CURRENTLY AFFORD THE EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS. ARE THOSE WHO DON'T WANT OR CAN'T USE THE HORMONE INJECTIONS. IF THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO ADD THIS THESE RESEARCHERS CAN DO. THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM OUR NEIGHBOR IN OREGON ALLOWS COMPENSATION FOR A DONATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES AS DOES NEW YORK. WE CAN TAK THEM BOTH AS PROOF THERE IS A WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF EXPLOITATION OR ABUSE. I WOULD CAUTION TO THAT RESEARCH CAN LEAVE CALIFORNIA. GREAT COMPANIES AND RESEARCHERS STRUGGLING TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK IN CALIFORNIA WILL GO ELSEWHERE. MY COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE IS DOING SOME OF OUR WORK IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAY EVENTUALLY BE FORCED TO MOVE ALL TOGETHER. MASSACHUSETTS WHICH SIMILAR HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DONATE EGGS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS. THE BOSTON AREA IS THE CLASSIC PLACE FOR LIFE SCIENCE RESEARCH IN THE US MANY RESEARCHERS AND COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY MOVED TO NEW YORK WHERE THE LAWS AROUND OBTAINING EGGS FOR RESEARCH AS MUCH FRIENDLIER. SO I COME HERE TO ASK PLEASE CONSIDER PASSING THIS LAW. THE BENEFITS IT COULD BRING TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE SO HIGH AND THE RISK IS LOW. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING AND FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT GOOD EVENING SHANNON SMITH CROWLEY REPRESENTING THE SPONSOR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. MY COLLEAGUES AT ALL WITH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF TRANSPORTING CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; RIGHT SPENCER WITH AMERICAN CULTURE OBGYN STRYCHNINE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. TWENTY ONE IN OPPOSITION. COME ON UP [inaudible] YEAH. YEAH I THINK SO. THE THING. MY NAME IS ELENA DELLE. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO I DONATE MY EGGS ONE TIME IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP INFERTILE COUPLE. I WAS PAY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MY DONATION. I PRODUCE SEVENTEEN ACHES IN MY RECIPIENTS HAD TWINS. THE UNUSED EMBRYOS CREATED FROM MY EGGS WERE USED FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THE FERTILITY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED TWENTY NINE DAYS OF DAILY LUPRON INJECTIONS FALL BY OTHER FERTILITY MEDICATIONS CONCLUDING WITH PAINFUL AND INVASIVE SURGERY FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PROPERLY SEDATED. I FELT TALKING IN MY OVARIES AS WELL AS REPEATED STOPPING BY THE NEEDLES THAT REMOVED MY EX. AFTERWARDS I WAS COMPELLED INCAPACITATED BY AN RELENTING MIGRAINES FOR SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THEY HAVE CONTINUED UNABATED. RENDERING ME DISABLED. MY FIRST NATURAL PUREE CONSISTED OF A WEEK OF HEAVY HEMORRHAGIC BLEEDING AND THESE HAVE CONTINUED EVER SINCE LEAVING ME FURTHER INCAPACITATED. WITHIN A YEAR I HAD SEVERE PAIN IN MY JOINTS AND BODY. I DID NOT CONNECT THIS PAIN TO MY DONATION. I RESEARCH LUPRON WITH THE F. T. A AND LEARN THE TWO WERE LIKELY LINKED. THE CLINIC DID NOT INFORM ME ABOUT LUPRON RISKS WHICH INCLUDE MIGRAINES JOINT PAIN. BONE LOSS AND AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEMS AMONG OTHERS. I REGULARLY SPEAK TO OTHER FORMER EGG DONORS. WHO WERE ON THIS DRUG WHO EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SYMPTOMS IN ADDITION TO OVERREACH AMPUTATION ENDOMETRIOSIS? INFERTILITY HYSTERECTOMY HEART PROBLEMS AND CANCER. BEFORE EGG DONATION. I WAS HEALTHY AND STRONG. I WAS FIREFIGHTER. I CAN NO LONGER WORKING MY PUBLIC SAFETY CAREER. I'VE LOST MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL INCOME IN CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE SPENT AN ESTIMATED. THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON MY MEDICAL CARE. I'VE LOST MY HOME AND I'VE HAD TO FILE BANKRUPTCY. AT FORTY TWO I REGULARLY SEE FOURTEEN DOCTORS INCLUDING EIGHT DIFFERENT PAIN MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST. MY ENDOCRINOLOGIST BELIEVES THAT MY ONGOING HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE LINKED TO THE SAME HORMONE DISRUPTORS THAT RESEARCH SUBJECTS WOULD YOU. USE. I'VE SPOKEN WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER DONORS WHOSE LIVES WERE RUINED DUE TO OUR DONATIONS NO ONE SHOULD ENTER A LIFE OF SUFFERING FOR RESEARCH. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PROCURING EGGS AS RESEARCH MATERIALS WE NEED A LONG TERM STUDIES ON DONOR ILLNESS AND MORTALITY. THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND WE HAVE STILL YET TO HAVE ONE LONG TERM STUDY ON A DONOR HEALTH. WOMEN DESERVE INFORMED CONSENT WITHOUT STUDIES WE DON'T HAVE IT. I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE AB NINE TWENTY TWO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. AND THANK OU FOR HEARING ME TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR DIANE TOBER I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO ROY LAUNCH THE I DON'T A RESEARCH PROJECT IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS BASED ON RESULTS FROM MY PILOT DATA WHICH I HAVE. PREPARED A BRIEF FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I AM PRO CHOICE PRO SCIENCE PRO INFORMED CONSENT AND LIKE MANY OF YOU I FULLY EMBRACE THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HER BODY. WITH THE OPERATIVE WORD BEING INFORMED. TODAY I'M GOING TO DRAW UPON A COMPLETED SURVEYS WITH A HUNDRED FORTY ONE AND DONE IS LIKE COLLECTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT IN TOTAL TO DATE I HAVE INTERVIEWED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND DONORS AND COLLECTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SURVEYS. NOTE MOST AND DONORS ARE FINE BUT THAT THERE'S ENOUGH CAUSE FOR CONCERN WAS THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ONES WHO NOT. THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO STEP FORWARD TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE HELPFUL. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS ARE IN MY STUDY WERE IN THE EARLY TO MID TWENTIES AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST CYCLE A DONATION CYCLE. OVER HALF REPORTED IN INCOMES BE LOWER SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE RECOMMENDS THE DONORS UNDERGO NORMAN NO MORE THAN SIX TAUGHT CYCLES. DUE IN PART TO POTENTIAL UNKNOWN AND KNOWN COMPLICATIONS YET NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DOLLARS IN MY EARLIER STUDY UNDERWENT BETWEEN EIGHT AND SEVENTEEN CYCLES. DUE TO FINANCIAL NEED WITH MANY PRODUCING BETWEEN THIRTY AND AS HIGH AS EIGHTY THREE EGGS IN A SINGLE CYCLE DUE TO AGGRESSIVE STUDENT HORMONE STEEL STIMULATION PROTOCOLS AND HIGH PRODUCING DONORS. THERE IS NO SYSTEM TRACKING DONOR CYCLES AND NO OVERSIGHT WHICH MEANS THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO INFORMED CONSENT. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCE COMPLICATIONS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE 1% CITED IN MUCH OF THE LITERATURE. THIRTY TWO OUT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE IN THIS PARTICULAR SAMPLES EXPERIENCE SEVERE OVER VERY HYPER STIMULATION SYNDROME THAT REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD OWNER IN MY STUDY EXPERIENCE CRITICAL -- HSS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE AND ALMOST DIED. OTHERS REPORTED SURGICAL MISHAPS OR VERY INTO PORTION REQUIRING REMOVAL OF THE OVARY. SEVERAL HAD ENDOMETRIOSIS -- REPRODUCTIVE CANCERS WITHIN A YEAR OF DONATION RENDERING THEM UNABLE TO HAVE THEIR OWN CHILDREN BUT AGAIN WITHOUT LONG TERM STUDIES WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CONNECTED TO THE REC DONATIONS ARE NOT. ACCORDING TO THE BILL TEXT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WILL A NOT BE UNDULY INDUCED AND WILL BE UNDERGO A RIGOROUS INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS. THE GIVEN THE LACK OF EXISTING RESEARCH AND MANY DONORS FINANCIAL PREPARE EDDIE THIS CLAIM IS PROBLEMATIC. AS A RESEARCHER I APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF SCIENCE BUT GIVEN THE FINDINGS THAT THE AND THE AND THE STORIES THAT I HAVE HEARD I DON'T THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO PASS AB. NINE TWENTY TWO WITHOUT BETTER SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE SUCH AS SOME OF WHICH I HAVE HAD OUTLINED IN THE BRIEF THAT I PROVIDED. BUT INCLUDING LIMITS ON THE NUMBERS OF EGGS PRODUCED PER CYCLE PROTECT POTENTIALLY CANCELING ANY CYCLE OVER WHICH TWENTY EGGS ARE BEING PRODUCED. EXCLUDING THE OWNERS WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE DONORS THAT HAVE HAD -- VERY TYPE OF STIMULATION SYNDROME BEFORE OR CAN'T OR CANCER IN THEIR FAMILY OR ENDOMETRIOSIS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED. AND THEN FINALLY TO INCLUDE A REGISTRY TO TRACK DONOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND DONOR EXPERIENCES OVER TIME SO WE CAN HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS ARE. AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FOLLOW UP CARE. I OPPOSE THIS BILL UNLESS AMENDED ENERGY TO CONSIDER THE AMENDMENTS I PROPOSE BEFORE PUTTING THIS BILL. AND THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. WE HAVE AN IN BETWEEN A POSITION. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK -- OUR BOARD IS A THICK POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR IN CPOPS INCLUSION OF A BILL OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS ANYONE ELSE. YOU KNOW WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS MR MAKES. YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE -- THINGS WHEN DO YOU HEAR FROM EXPERTS -- AND IT'S DIFFICULT -- IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND TO BE ABLE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND. THE DYNAMICS WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE AUTHOR -- HAS SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME STUDYING -- AND I KNOW THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO DO -- THAT WORK I'M TO SUPPORT THIS -- TODAY KNOWING -- THAT THE THAT THE AUTHOR IS SINCERE AND WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD HARM ANY INDIVIDUAL SO I HOPE THAT -- YOU CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- THEN I'LL BE SUPPORTING US TODAY. THANK YOU. AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANYONE ELSE. HELLO -- I PLACE WAS SAFE IS APPRECIATE GOT TO BRING THIS FORWARD AYE I APPRECIATE THE WITNESSES ON BUT THE OP OPPOSITION AS WELL -- I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS -- AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS ANYONE TO BE HARMED IN THIS IN THIS IN ANYWAY -- SIDE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO WE WANT GOOD SOUND SCIENCE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE HARMED IN AND THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE THAT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED DELIBERATIONS REGARDING THIS BUT I AM PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL FOR TODAY THANK YOU AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION -- WE HAVE A MOTION -- AM I MISSING HERE CURRY A SECOND BY MISTER RAMOS WHICH LIKE CLINICS YEAH MY STAFF HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT I AM NOT TO CRY AND ANYMORE TESTIMONY SO I'M GONNA THE SAME THINGS. BUT IT IS ONLY WITH THIS RESEARCH THAT WE WILL REACH PROGRESS IN THE PROCESS WILL GET EASIER AND AND IT HAS GOTTEN BETTER. AND WITH THAT OF COURSE I WILL ALWAYS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAYS AND AND BE VERY MINDFUL OF IT. I'M OMEN'S HEALTH IS A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY THE PRIORITY TO ME AS IS IS HEALTHY BABIES AND HAVE BEEN MOTHER HOOD. SO WITH THAT I RISK I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES -- SUPPORT IN ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT I BRING TO THEM THAT ARE THE MOST COMFORTABLE ISSUES TO DISCUSS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN APPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS FOR WE HAVE A MOTION -- AS I SAID BY -- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY IN A SECOND BY MISTER RAMOS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS -- M. SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES AYE MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AGAR CURRY I BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BONTA AYE BURKE. BURKE I WICKS. FLORA. FOR I LEVEL [inaudible] MCCARTY. THIS AREA. NAZARIAN AYE I'M SORRY MCCARTY PARTY I NAZARIAN AYE. RAMOS RAMOS I RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ AYE AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON. GIVE ELEVEN VOTES YOUR BILLS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OF FOR OTHER OTHERS TO VOTE. MR BONTA WHICH WAY TO GO. BONTA HAS AB. FORTY FOUR FOURTEEN AND AND YOU KNOW WE PUT AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE ARKANSAS. I SAW THAT I LIKE THAT A LOT. THANK YOU YOU'RE OKAY YEAH I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER VICE CHAIR WITH EVERYTHING MISTER VICE CHAIR FOR THE WHATEVER YOU READY THANK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. AB FOUR ONE FOUR SIMPLY RE ESTABLISHES THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY PAYMENTS THAT CONGRESS ROLL BACK. THERE BY ENSURING THAT HEALTH CARE MEANS AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. REPEAL OF THE PENALTY PAYMENT IS PROJECTED TO RESULT IN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT. HEALTH COVERAGE BY. TWENTY TWENTY BY SIMPLY REESTABLISHING THE PENALTY AB FOUR ONE FOUR COULD ALSO GENERATE REVENUE FOR WHICH GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS INDICATED COULD BE USED TO INCREASE INSURANCE SUBSIDIES FOR HOUSEHOLDS PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE. TO COVER CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE. TO FIGHT FOR EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR OUR RESIDENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS BETH CAPELL WITH HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA AND AUTUMN OGDEN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK MOVES THE BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO AND THEY HAVE A HEALTH TAXES CALIFORNIA IS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY WELL THE POINT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS TO GET PEOPLE HEALTH INSURANCE. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AS PART OF A BALANCED SOLUTION THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPRESENTED THAT BAND TO USE A PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS PROVIDED AFFORDABILITY HELP. AND ALSO INCLUDED MANDATES ON INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY SEEN A DROP OF 24% IN NEW ENROLLMENT SINCE ALL OF THE DISRUPTION THAT'S GONE ON AS MR BONTA SAID THERE'S PROJECTED INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED WHICH IS THE WRONG DIRECTION IN OUR JUDGMENT -- YOU WILL HEAR PERHAPS FROM THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION I ASSURE YOU THAT IT YEAH WE WERE YOU FOR VIçT LANGUAGE AND IT DOES -- AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT WE ARE HERE ON THE SAME DAY THAT A DOCTOR WOULD SPILL TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY EVEN FURTHER WILL ALSO BE HEARD SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS A IMPORTANT PACKAGE AND PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN RESULT AMOUNT IN SMITH WITH THE CANCER SOCIETY AND THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS MAINTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND WILL HELP TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. AT WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CANCER PATIENTS TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE. WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIANS IN THE MARKET THE BURDEN OF COSTS FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE VERY SICK. WHO CANNOT GO WITHOUT COVERAGE EIGHTY FOUR ONE FOUR WILL HELP TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST -- BY ENSURING THAT THE BURDEN OF CROSS SO DIVERSE DIVERSIFIED AND SHARED BY ALL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. OTHERS TO SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS COUNTY DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX OFTEN THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THE SAID SHORT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE AND SUPPORT. RIGHT SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUT ATTIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. DARIA MCGREW CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE SUPPORTER BLUESHIELD CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. NICK LOUISA'S CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS IN SUPPORT. KATHY MUSBURGER HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MICHELLE GIVEN SO THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. NOW IS IT ALL WITH CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT. SEVENTY WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT NETWORK IN SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED AB FOLKS. WERE OPPOSED TO EIGHTY FOUR ONE FOUR BECAUSE IT IMPLEMENTS A REGRESSIVE TAX WHICH WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. DO NOT GO WITHOUT HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT AND THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THOSE FACTS. CNA DID NOT OPPOSE THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF A LARGER DEAL THAT OVERALL HELPED OUR PATIENTS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS NECESSARY IN AFFORDABLE CARE ACT NEGOTIATIONS TO ENSURE NATIONWIDE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS AND TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO CARE SUCH AS INSURANCE COMPANIES BARRING FOLKS WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT GETTING ANYTHING IN RETURN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THIS TIME AROUND. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THE PROFITS FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE CAN BE USED TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT INCREASE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FROM THE STATE WON'T HELP OF INSURANCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO RAISE RATES AND GOBBLE UP ANY INCREASES THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALLOCATE. EIGHTY FOUR ONE FOUR IS A CASH COW FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE BILL MAKES NO GUARANTEE THAT HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T TURN AROUND AND CONTINUE TO RAISE RATES OUTRAGEOUSLY. EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL WOULD FORCE A WHOLE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION TO PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCT. AB FOREIGN FOR HUSTLE ALSO HAS NO CLEAR DECLARATION TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE EXPENSE OF FOR PROFIT PRODUCT THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY SELLS. BUT WHO MAY MAKE ABOVE THE THRESHOLD TO QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE ACA HOW TO SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FROM THE PENALTY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD COVERAGE -- IT SPECIFICALLY DEFINED UNDER THE LAW ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS REQUIRED HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTION WOULD EXCEED 8% OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME WELL A PREVENT SENT IS STILL TOO HIGH FOR MANY WORKING CLASS FAMILIES. AT THE VERY LEAST THIS LAW HAD A CLEAR STANDARD. THE LOWEST TIER OF HEALTH INSURANCE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA EXCHANGES THE BRONZE LEVEL THE BRONZE LEVEL ON AVERAGE MEANS YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN ONLY PAY YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE OTHER. FORTY NURSES KNOW IF THEIR PATIENTS CAN'T PAY FOR INSURANCE A PENALTY FEE IS NOT GOING TO PUSH THEM INTO PURCHASING A SUB PAR PRODUCT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR PATIENTS WILL BE STUCK PAYING A FEE WILL STILL NOT HAVING ACCESS TO CARE. ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH CARE COST AND UTILIZATION PRODUCT THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL STAY COSTS JUST OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. EVEN WITH BRONZE LEVEL COVERAGE THAT PRICE WOULD BANKRUPT MOST FAMILIES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS INCREASE BY TWELVE POINT 5%. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THEIR ANTICIPATED TO RISE BY NEARLY 9%. AB FOUR ONE FOUR PUTS CASH IN THE POCKETS OF INSURANCE COMPANY EXECUTIVES WITH NO GUARANTEED GOOD OUTCOMES FOR OUR PATIENTS OR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. NURSES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A BEFORE ONE FOUR AND ALSO YOU VOTE NO. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION READ OPPOSITION. OKAY BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD HI DEAL FOUNTAIN REPRESENTING HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SUPPORTERS OF AN ACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO IN OPPOSITION -- TO EIGHTY FOUR ONE FOUR WE DID A POLL. RECENTLY. OF OVER TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS -- 67% WERE OPPOSED TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTIES -- MODE A LOT OF PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THE INSURANCE THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DROPPING OFF -- IT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU THIS IN CONTEXT -- COST OF LIVING BAY AREA IS REALLY HIGH IT'S TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT -- IS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY COST OF LIVING -- SO EAT MAY BE A PERCENT OF HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT NOT OF WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR EVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE -- THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT IT. THIS IS THE SECOND THING IT IS THAT TO IT ALSO -- THIS SHOULD COME UNDER THE THE THE PURVIEW OF THE COUNCIL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND I STILL DON'T SEE THAT BEING APPOINTED SO THANK YOU [inaudible] VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE OUT QUESTIONS WITH THE COMES BY THE OPPOSITION MISTER BONTA. YES THANK YOU THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WILL. ENCOURAGING SENT PEOPLE TO GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE THAT'S GOOD WE LIKE IT WILL MORE PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE OPPOSITE WILL OCCUR WITHOUT IT. AND WITH THE THE PENALTY WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUBSIDIZE ACOSTA LOWER PREMIUMS EVERYBODY. THIS IS NOT A CURE ALL A PANACEA SILVER BULLET IN AND OF ITSELF WE NEED YOUR BILL DOCTOR WOULD WE NEED IN A SERIES OF BILLS OF ALL WORKING ON BECAUSE WE KNOW ABOUT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE WE LOWER IT. TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THOSE EFFORTS TO HELP CREATE. A SCENARIO CALIFORNIA WE HOPE WE ASPIRE TO WHERE EVERYONE IS COVERED AND IT'S AFFORDABLE -- THE BILL. DOES EXPRESSED INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THE SAME EXEMPTIONS THAT THE ACA HAD. THE ACA HAS EXEMPTION FOR HARDSHIP FOR INCOME -- FOR INABILITY TO PAY AND WE THINK THOSE ARE PRUDENT -- AND THAT'S WHY WE MODELED IT AFTER THE ACA'S -- EXEMPTIONS -- WE ALSO HAVE SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO SEVEN OH FOUR WHICH SETS FORTH THAT THE THAT COVER CALIFORNIA WILL BE IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL -- EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION SO READING THOSE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED -- IT WILL BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD AND AND ARE DRESSED IN THE CURRENT FORM OF THE BILL AND WITH THE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSENT TO THIS DISCUSSION WE KNOW THERE'S A VEHICLE ALSO IN THE SENATE OUR GOVERNOR IS IS IS IS FOCUSED ON THIS AND WORKING TOGETHER AS A AND ASSEMBLY. TO IDENTIFY SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA -- SO WITH THAT I RESPECT THE FEI VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. VERY MUCH. ANY ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF MISS WALDRON -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUES SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST GET A QUESTION. ON THE RECORD -- AS FAR AS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE INSURANCE. FIELD THE COULD ANSWER MAYBE -- IN ACTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD. HELP WITH THE RISK POOL I WOULD ASSUME OR CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT YEAH WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE'S PREMIUMS MORE PEOPLE IN THE POOL. I AM JUST CURIOUS. I MEAN I JUST QUICKLY SAY AND% AND I THINK MY WITNESSES WILL BE ABLE TO SAY BETTER BUT THE THE THE BIGGER THE POOL THE PART OF THE POOL THE MORE DIVERSE THE POOL THE MORE PARTICIPANTS IN THE POOL. THAT THE BETTER AND IT WILL HELP READERS REDUCE COSTS WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGER INSURANCE POOL WITH EVERYONE PARTICIPATING -- IT WILL LEAD TO MORE PEOPLE WITH CARE AND LOWER COSTS -- LET ME WITNESSES RESPOND AS WELL. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- BETH BELL HEALTH ACCESS COVERED CALIFORNIA ESTIMATED THE PREMIUMS WENT UP FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT THIS YEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE REPEAL OF THE PENALTY. IN OTHER STATES WHERE THE PENALTY HAS BEEN IMPOSED PREMIUMS ACTUALLY WENT DOWN. SO IT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE IN THE RISK POOL IS MISTER BONTA SAID BY ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE COVERAGE WHETHER IT'S MEDI CAL OR THEIR EMPLOYERS COVERAGE OR TO BUY IT THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND SO IT WILL DRIVE DOWN PREMIUMS AND COMBINED WITH THE AFFORDABILITY HELP AND DOCTOR WOULD SPILL WILL REALLY HELP PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD COVERAGE. OKAY THANK YOU -- BUT THAT IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN AND WE HAVE A MOTION. THEIR MOTION BY MISTAKE YEAR CURRY A SECOND BY MISS BURKE JUDGE CLOSENESS BONTA.

AB TWELVE FORTY SIX INSURER'S ALL CONSUMERS HAVE COMPREHENSIVE BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PROTECTING. PROTECTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHICH STATE DEPARTMENT REGULATES THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. ACCORDING TO THE RECENT SERB ANALYSIS OF THE BILL THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS INSURED BY LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS AS OTHER CALIFORNIANS WHOSE COVERAGE IS REGULATED BY THE MHC? SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CONSUMERS WITH COVERAGE REGULATED UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT. HAVE BEEN GRANTED GUARANTEED COVERAGE THAT PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE INCLUDING BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS DOCTOR SERVICES HOSPITAL SERVICES EMERGENCY CARE LAB IMOGENE AND HOSPICE CARE. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA THE SAME BENEFITS STANDARDS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROTECTIONS WERE EXTENDED TO CALIFORNIANS WITH INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL EMPLOYER COVERAGE REGULATED UNDER. THE INSURANCE CODE AND THE KNOX KEEN ACT. AB TWELVE FORTY SIX CLOSES THE GAP IN STATE LINE ENSURES THAT THOSE WITH A LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE REGULATED BY CDI. ENJOY THE SAME HEALTH BENEFITS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ALREADY HAVE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MERRY JUNE DS ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSOR HEALTH AXIS CALIFORNIA. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MJ DS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA TO SPONSORS OF AB TWELVE FORTY SIX WHICH WOULD LEVEL UP THE PLAYING FIELD. AND ENSURE CALIFORNIANS WOULD STATE REGULATED COVERAGE HAD THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS REGARDLESS OF WHO REGULATE STIR COVERAGE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CODIFY THESE MINIMUM BENEFITS STANDARDS IN THE INSURANCE CODE BECAUSE UNDER FEDERAL LAW LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE ONLY HAS TO MEET MINIMUM VALUE COVERAGE THERE SHE HOLDS. THAT MEANS MINIMUM VALUE COVERAGE COULD INCLUDE VISIT LIMITS FOR EXAMPLE. THIS COULD MEAN HOSPITALIZATION IS COVERED BUT IS LIMITED TO THREE TO FIVE DAYS. THIS CREATES GAPS IN BENEFITS AND ALSO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS WOULD LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE IN THE CDI VERSES DOES REGULATED BY THE DIEM H. C.. AS NOTED BY THE CHEAPER BUT NOW SAYS THERE WILL BE NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE OR IMPACT AND BENEFIT CHANGES. THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN YOUR THE STATIONS OR PREMIUM INCREASES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR I SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. YOU HAVE TO RUN. THE GETTING LATE I DIDN'T YOU. MORNING GARBLED CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE -- THE ONE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON BOARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SEVENTY WALK INS WITH THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE TO STAY IN OPPOSITION WE'VE HAD SOME BRIEF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSOR. WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE BURKE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD HAVE NO OR MINIMAL IMPACT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS IT WOULD TRIGGER. A RE FILING ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED LARGE GROUP FILINGS INTO THE DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AT JUST ABOUT WORKLOAD AND REFINE ALL THOSE WE ALSO DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS FOR THOSE CD I REGULATED PRODUCTS. IT WOULD TIE THEM TO DE MHC REGULATIONS SO THERE WOULD BE A QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORS. WE ALSO WANT TO JUST. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES WITH RESPECT TO COVERAGE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS MAYBE OUTSIDE OF THIS PROCESS AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET OUR CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO GENERAL COVERAGE. AS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET MANY TIMES THOSE PRODUCTS ARE FAR MORE ROBUST. AND COVERAGE THAN YOU NORMALLY SEE IN A SMALL GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL MARKET SO AT THIS BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE IF WE'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COST IN FILINGS INTO THE DEPARTMENT. THERE'S A DIRECT BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS AND RIGHT NOW WE JUST REALLY QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY OR THERE'S ANY DEFICIENCIES WE CAN ADDRESS OUTSIDE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER ALLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND I WOULD JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND MISS HAWKINS THANK YOU. DONE MORE IN HIGGINS REPRESENTING AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE.

BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT TIME LINE WITH REGARDS TO HOW INSURERS WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLY SHOULD AB TWELVE FORTY SIX BE ACTED. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THE BILL ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND AND WITHOUT THEIR THE MOBILE BUT A MOTION AND A SECOND. NO WE'RE WAITING. FOR OKAY -- I WILL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION BY MS BURKE A SECOND BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES.

RAMOS ROTH AYE RODRIGUEZ RIGHT I GUESS I SANTIAGO [inaudible] WALDRON [inaudible] OVER NOW. EIGHT THREE GIVE ABLE TO BILLS THAT WILL LEAVE THE ROAD OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU. MISTER MCCARTY ARE YOU READY THINKING ABOUT. I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE OPIOID PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION ACT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER AND I MAKE IT UNLIKELY DO WELL COMING UP HERE. TWO PRESENTS A BILL TOGETHER BUT THAT'S IS THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMEDIAN AMENDMENTS. SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO PAY TO A SCENARIO IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUY A MATTRESS? A TV -- BATTERIES YOU PAY INTO PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP FUND TO PAY FOR THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES BORN OUT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT IMPACT OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT'S THE SAME MENTALITY THAT THAT WE PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY. THIS A PROVIDES FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO TACKLE THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AND CRISIS IS IMPACTING ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ALL OF OUR CITIES. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT MANUFACTURES AND WHOLESALERS THAT SELL OR DISTRIBUTE OPIOIDS. A REPORT ON THE AMOUNT OF THE CELL EVERY YEAR TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THOSE NUMBERS WITH SB INTO A FORMULA. BASED UPON WHICH THEY WOULD PAY INTO THIS OPIOID PREVENTION REHABILITATION FUND. WE KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS SEVERE WE KNOW THAT THREE AND FOUR RECENT HEROIN USERS GOT THEIR START. FROM PRESCRIPTION PAIN. TELLS. WE KNOW THAT OVER TWENTY ONE HUNDRED OPIOID DEATHS OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LAST YEAR FIRST FOR NUMBERS ABOUT THIS. WILL BE OUR ROOMS ARE FILLED ACROSS OUR STATE FLOODED WITH OPIOID RELATED PATIENTS. OVER FOUR THOUSAND LAST YEAR. GOING INTO THE ER PER DAY THE COSTS ARE TREMENDOUS HONOR TAXPAYERS ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PLACING. ADDITIONAL BURNS AND AND IMPACTS ON TAXPAYERS AND TAXING THE OVERALL EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SO THIS ISSUE BASICALLY ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. WHO SHOULD PAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS CERTAINLY OUR TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING THROUGH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE PAYING? CERTAINLY ARE COUNTIES ARE PAYING AS WELL THROUGH THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS BUT THIS RAISES THE ISSUE SHOULD THE INDUSTRY THAT HELPED CREATE THIS PROBLEM HELP STEP UP. WITH THE SOLUTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING HERE TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDS CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE TO HELP TACKLE THIS PROBLEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BUT THESE FUNDS WILL EXPIRE IN. TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED A FINANCIAL PLAN CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR EFFORTS AS WELL AS FOCUS ON CURRENT PROBLEMS AN ACCOUNT THAT YOU CAN HEAR FROM IN JUST A SECOND -- I DO HAVE SOME SOME ISSUES I WANT TO ADDRESS YEAH I POTENTIALLY IN THE QUEUE IN A IN OUR CLOTHES. ON SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THAT LET ME INTRODUCE SOMEONE OR GALLAGHER. TO CO. WELL THANK YOU ALL TO HONOR TO BE HERE -- TO PRESENT IS JOINTLY WITH THIS HOWEVER MCCARTY WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW. AND I THINK WHAT I WANT TO GET ACROSS IS -- AND I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS IS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC -- CERTAINLY HAS. YOUR BEEN NATIONWIDE -- IT'S CERTAINLY HIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IS ESPECIALLY AFFECTING. OUR RURAL AREAS OF OF THE STATE -- IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT A MAP OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SEE SOME OF THE HOT SPOTS. THERE AND SOME OF OUR MOST -- RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE -- AND SHASTA COUNTY SISKIYOU COUNTY BUTTE COUNTY -- THAT I REPRESENT -- AND JUST YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF SOME OF THE STATS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE OPIOID [inaudible] SNAPSHOT. THE DASHBOARD YOU CAN SEE THAT WE ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OPIOID PER CAPITA OPIOID. ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OVERDOSES -- FOUR DEATHS RELATED TO OPIOID OVERDOSE IS OVERDOSES -- IN BUTTE COUNTY ALONE A RECENT STAT WAS IT THERE WERE THIRTEEN HUNDRED PRESCRIPTIONS PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS -- AND THAT EQUATES TO WE HAVE AN AVERAGE OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY AND THEN THESE. PRESCRIBED PER RESIDENT ANNUALLY -- THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS -- SIX HUNDRED FORTY SO THAT'S YOU KNOW GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- IN SERVE OUR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WHAT IN THE WAY THAT I APPROACH THIS ISSUE. YOU AS A REPUBLICAN. IS RIGHT NOW OUR TAXPAYERS ARE SADDLED WITH THE ENTIRE COST OF THIS BILL -- IN DEALING WITH THE DOMESTIC ISSUES THAT HAPPEN IN DEALING WITH. THE ADMISSIONS TO HOSPITALS THAT ARE ALREADY THAT ARE ALREADY OVERLOADED AS YOU KNOW -- IN DEALING AND THAT MOST OF THIS IS TAKING CARE BY PUBLIC DOLLARS -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WHO FROM WHO OF WHO PLAYED A ROLE. IN CREATING THIS PROBLEM HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL -- AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT I BELIEVE. AB. TWENTY FORTY SIX ATTEMPTS TO DO. WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A FUND -- THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD PAY INTO. THAT WOULD HELP. ADDRESS THESE THESE HOT SPOTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED TREATMENT -- THAT I CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THESE REAL COMMITTEES WERE OVER TAX WE DON'T HAVE. WE DON'T HAVE WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF AND THE CAPABILITY. TO TAKE ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DEALING WITH ADDICTION AND ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. THERE WITH. AND SO I THINK ALL WE'RE REALLY ASKING IS THAT EVERYBODY PLAY A ROLE EVERYBODY PLAY A ROLE. IN THEIR PROPER ROLE IN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OPIOID EPIDEMIC -- AND I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERN. YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN LABELED A JOB KILLER. WELL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE ULTIMATE JOB KILLER IS ADDICTION. WHAT WE SEEN HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO THE ADDICTION THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FACING -- AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT COMES THERE WITH -- SO I WOULD. I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO LOOK AT THIS BILL CLOSELY -- WE WE CERTAINLY ARE WANTING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WANTED TO WORK AND FIND A WAY HERE -- BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS NEEDED. AND TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION -- TO HOPEFULLY PROVIDE -- YEAH A SOLUTION GOING FORWARD IN A FUNDING SOURCE GOING FORWARD TO ADDRESS -- WHAT IS TO BECOME A A HUGE PROBLEM IN MANY OF OUR AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WITH -- AND WE DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR BUTTE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER WHO CAN GIVE YOU A LOT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION -- ANDY MILLER. THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR GOOD EVENING -- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS ANNE MILLER I AM A FAMILY PRACTICE DOCTOR AND HE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY BUTTE I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I'M IMPRESSED WITH YOUR STAMINA -- AT THIS BILL USES AN APPROACH -- THAT CONSIDERS THE GREATER SOCIETAL COST OF A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND THAT'S AN APPROACH THAT'S BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES LIKE IN TOBACCO. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OPIOID CRISIS THAT WE FACE TOGETHER HAS BEEN THE MARKETING AND MISS MARKETING. OF OPIOID MEDICATIONS. THESE MEDICATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN GREAT PROFITS FOR THEIR PRODUCERS. BUT GREAT PUBLIC COSTS BOTH FINANCIALLY AND IN LIVES. HI THIS BILL BEGINS TO PLACE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT LOGICALLY BELONGS. THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED RURAL AREAS AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY. BOTH OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. IN BIãU COUNTY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AMONG THE WORST RATES OF OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS PER CAPITA AND HOSPITALIZATION OVERDOSES. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS LOCALLY ON OUR DEATH RATE AND SOME OTHER IMPORTANT RELATED MEASURES BUT ALL OF THESE RATES ARE STILL UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. WHEN I TOOK THE POSITION OF HEALTH OFFICER VIEW COUNTY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO -- THE IF YOU COUNTY RESIDENTS WERE PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS AT THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL RATE AS YOU HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED. TO HI THIS BILL INTELLIGENTLY ADDRESSES THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS. ARE BASED ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL IF ENACTED WOULD JOIN OTHER -- STATE LOCAL EFFORTS TO DEGREES YOUR USE THIS USE -- DEATHS AND TO BOLSTER SOME MUCH NEEDED MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR OPIATE ADDICTION TO DATE NEARLY ALL THE FUNDING FOR THESE RELATED EFFORTS HAVE COME FROM FEDERAL SOURCESAND AS YOU HEARD. THOSE ARE DUE TO SUNSET SOON. OUR RESOURCES DEDICATED TO APPEAR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SAVES LIVES AND MONEY WHICH IS WHY I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF IT I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MICHELLE GIVEN SO THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA OUR APOLOGIES FOR NOT GETTING OUR LETTER IN ON TIME FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILLABLE WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CONNIE DELGADO BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA'S LIKE OF MY WORK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION THIS CHAIRMAN WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEE L. LINDAHL'S WITH THE HEALTH CARE DISTRIBUTION ALLIANCE -- REPRESENTING THIRTY FOUR PRIMARY PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS WERE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT NEARLY IDENTICAL TO NEW YORK LAW THAT WAS FOUND ON CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WOULD CREATE AN ARBITRARY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SURCHARGE. ON WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS AND MANUFACTURERS. IN THE FEDERAL JUDGE'S DECISION IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT PLACING A FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT. I'M PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS IS ILL CONCEIVED AND VIOLATES THE DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. AS WELL AS COULD REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF OPIOID MEDICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEEDS THEM WHICH THE JUDGE NOTED RUNS COUNTER TO PUBLIC INTEREST. THE COURT'S DECISION LEFT LITTLE ROOM TO DEBATE THAT THIS IS A PART THIS PROPOSAL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HM IT'S MEMBERS SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE FEDERAL COURT ALONG WITH PATIENT PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS ESTABLISHING A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SURCHARGE COULD INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND THREATEN TO DIMINISH ACCESS TO VITAL THERAPIES FOR LEGITIMATE PATIENTS THOSE PATIENTS SEEKING EPIDURAL DURING CHILDBIRTH -- SEEKING ANESTHESIA OR MORPHINE WHEN THEY'RE OPERATING OR IN SURGERY AND EVEN FOR THOSE SEEKING TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS -- ALL OF THOSE PATIENTS UNDER THE CARE OF LICENSE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IN MANY INSTANCES THE PROPOSED ASSESSMENT RESULT IN A RATE HIGHER THAN THE COST OF THE MEDICATIONS THEMSELVES -- THREATENING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS WHEN CONSIDERING THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL IT'S CRITICAL TO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR PLACE. HM MEMBERS DO NOT RESEARCH MANUFACTURE MARKET OR PRESCRIBE MEDICATION NOR DO THEY INFLOWS PRESCRIBING PATTERNS THE DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR PATIENT BENEFIT DESIGN. WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR SIMPLY ENSURE THE SAFEST MOST EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF MEDICAL PRODUCT TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES INCLUDING SEVENTY THOUSAND ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE MEDICATIONS BEING DISTRIBUTED ARE BASED SOLELY ON ORDERS FROM DE A LICENSED PROVIDERS PHARMACIES AND HOSPITALS. ORIGINATING FROM PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY LICENSED PHYSICIANS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN THE LEGISLATION A PREDOMINATELY PENALIZE THE WHOLESALER. AFTER THE FIRST AND SEE MAKING A TRANSACTION INTO THE STATE. HM IT'S MEMBER SUPPORT POLICIES THE DECREASE OF YOUR DEMAND AND DISPENSING WHILE ALSO ENSURING LEGITIMATE PATIENTS MAINTAIN ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE TREATMENTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY PLACING -- FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT ON WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS FOR COMPLETING ORDERS OF TRUSTED MEDICAL PROS PROFESSIONALS PLACES THIS INDUSTRY IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND FOR THAT WE ASK YOU TO OPPOSE ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU. PETER CALLOUSED ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE ASSOCIATION -- WHILE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS LAUDABLE AND WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND GALLAGHER THE HOSPICE ASSOCIATION MUST AND HAPPILY OPPOSE THE BILL -- THE REASON BEING IS THAT HOSPICE IS A CAPITATED BENEFIT THEY ARE AT RISK FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY SPEND IN CARE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL. FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE AT THE END OF LIFE MORPHINE. OPIOIDS ARE A PART OF HOW CARE IS PROVIDED -- DATED DAY BY DAY HOUR BY HOUR MORPHINE IS ADJUSTED TO ENSURE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING ENOUGH -- TO BE COMFORTED IN THEIR FINAL DAYS. WE KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS MADE A LEGITIMATE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO AVOID THE COSTSBEING PASSED DOWN THE FOR THE CHAIN WE DO NOT SEE HOW THAT WILL BE PRACTICAL IN THE LONG RUN. IF MANY AFFECT FEWER MANUFACTURERS PARTICIPATE MAKING MORPHINE OR OPIOID PRODUCTS SECONDLY LOOKING AT NEW YORK AT THE SITUATION THERE THAT CLAUSE WAS NOT SUSTAINED WE BELIEVE THE COSTS WILL BE PASSED DOWN AND THAT WOULD BE. IT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT HOSPICES ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING QUALITY CARE TO THE TERMINALLY ILL. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MICHELLE REVERSE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WE TOO MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE SEE PAGE HIS BEEN I THINK A GOOD PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR COLLEAGUES AND HEALTH CARE TRYING. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES WERE ALREADY BEING SQUEEZED OUT OF THE MARKET DOING DUE TO LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES BY PPM SET SET TRY. THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MAINTAINING STOCK FOR A NUMBER OF MEDICATIONS AND WHILE WE DO ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS GOAL TO PREVENT. THIS COSTS FROM BEING PASSED ON TO THE PURCHASER WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND PURCHASED SO THERE IS THE PHARMACIST. SO THEY WILL BEAR THE BURDEN OF THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES WITH -- THE DISTRIBUTORS AND THE MANUFACTURERS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A WAY. TO ENFORCE THE THE PROVISION OF THE BILL AGAIN WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROHIBIT THE PASSING DOWN OF THIS TAX ON TO THE END PURCHASER AND AGAIN THAT BE IN THE COMMUNITY PHARMACISTS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS MEDICATION WILL BECOME UNAFFORDABLE FOR PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO START. MAKING IT DIFFICULT AND IN SOME CASES IMPOSSIBLE FOR PATIENTS TO BE ABLE TO A CAR THE MEDICATIONS WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT THERE BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL NEEDS AND WHO NEED THAT PAIN MEDICATION. AND IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO AND TO GET THE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED SO WITHOUT MY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO FILE. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MORGAN HAGEN'S REPRESENTING BY A COMMON OPPOSITION AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION COULD BE HERE BUT THEY ARE ALSO POST. FRED NO OR REPRESENTING PHARMA AND WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU THANK YOU. KAREN SARKISIAN WHAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE OPPOSED. I ALWAYS AT ALLWITH CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COLLISION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEE KNOWN BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] MR BONTA. THANK YOU TO OUR OFFICE FOR BRINGING FORWARD -- THIS IMPORTANT BILL I WANT JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO THE NEW YORK. LITIGATION AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK'S OPIOID STEWARDSHIP ACT THAT IT HAD. YEAH I'M CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON ON HOW YOUR BILL MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN THAT THAT NEW YORK -- FOR WHICH THERE WAS A ANALYSIS AROUND THE DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE AND ALSO MADE A COMMENT ON ANY SEVERABILITY COMPONENT YOU HAVE YOUR BILL. WELL TO THINK SO OUR PROPOSAL WAS BASED LOOSELY ON THAT THE NEW YORK PROPOSAL. A LOWER COURT STRUCK DOWN THAT PIECE THE STATE OF NEW YORK DID FILE AN APPEAL TWO MONTHS AGO SO IT'S GOING TO THE PROCESS. BUT PLANNING FOR THE WORST WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION A SEVERABILITY CLAUSE SO IF THIS AT PEACE -- BECOMES INVALID THIS WOULD WOULD BE KNOCKED OUT BUT THE REST THE BILL WOULD GO FOR THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS. CONCERNS. SO I JUST COM COM COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOU CLOSE THE ON THIS -- MISTER MCCARTY AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE STILL SOME UNRESOLVED ISSUES HERE -- HOWEVER -- NO ONE CAN QUESTION YOUR INTENT AS FAR AS TRIED IT AND AND MISTER GALLAGHER AND AND AND TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP STE -- HELP PROTECT PEOPLE AND BEGIN TO STEM THE CRISIS AS MUCH AS WE CAN -- YOU DO ENJOY IT A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND I I ONCE I SAY I YEAH WE'VE BEEN FOR WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING ON YOUR GOOD ISSUE. THE TWO OF US ALL OF US FOR YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THIS IS MY FIFTH YEAR AS AS IT IS WITH YOU WITH YOU GUYS AND WE'RE OUT WE ALSO BROUGHT STRUGGLING WITH THIS AND AND THERE ARE NO MAGIC BULLETS AND AND AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- COMES UP IN THE BILL -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING ONLY CLARIFICATION GOING FOR TO GOT IT DIDN'T COME WITH THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE BACKING FOR TWIN MANUFACTURES OR WHOLESALERS. AS WE NEED TO CLARIFY IS IT IS IT BOTH IS IT ONE OR THE OTHER AND AND SO THERE'S SOME THERE'S A LITTLE BIT CLEANER WORK TO DO THERE AS WELL -- AND AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW AS IF IF AS THE BILL IS ENVISIONED IN YOU ACTUALLY BEGIN TO SEE A DECREASE -- THAT THAT THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NUMBER THAT YOU'RE TARGETING SHOULD BE DECREASING AS WELL -- SO THAT THERE AS AS YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ARE NOT PAYING FOR MORE -- IN THE THE PEOPLE STILL PAYING OR NOT PAYING MORE -- YOU'RE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THERE IN THE IN THE LOWER LOWER COST DIRECTION SO. SO I EIGHT YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE THERE'S CONTINUES TO BE WORK ON TO DO ON THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY THE TWO OF YOU -- LIKE MYSELF OR PASSIONATE ABOUT DOING WHAT WE CAN TO TO HELP STE TO HELP PROTECT PEOPLE AND STEM THE STEM THE PROPER STEM THE TIDE SO TO SPEAK -- IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT THAT I A OFFER A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- AND THAT WOULD GIVE YOU TO AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE IF YOU'D LIKE. SURE FOR FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH US FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AND YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE ISN'T GOING AWAY BUT WE DO KNOW WE DO WE DO NEED MORE. TREATMENT AND SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE WHO ARE ADDICTED. WE KNOW THAT ALL EOPLE TAKING PAIN KILLERS DON'T GO TO HEAR WHEN WE DO NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE ON HERE ONE THREE AND FOUR OF THEM. CAME FROM PAIN KILLERS IT'S A REAL PROBLEM IN THE FEDERAL MONEY IS GOING TO RUN OUT. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO STEP UP AS WELL HE SAYS SHOULD JUST BE BORN THE TAXPAYERS ARE SHOULD THE INDUSTRY. PARTICIPATE AS MR GALLAGHER SAID SO THAT'S THE SOLUTION WE HAVE HERE THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THERE FOR A HUNDRED MILLION. THAT'S JUST THAT'S A STARTING PLACE ORDER PLAN IT MAY NOT BE THE FOR THE FINAL -- NUMBER THAT WE HAVE DOWN THERE AS WE GO DOWN SO WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. YOU DO BRING UP A GREAT POINT SUCH AS WITH THE TOBACCO TAX HOPEFULLY THE PARTICIPATION RATE. WITHOUT WITH TOBACCO PAINKILLERS WILL GO DOWN. SO WHERE WHERE WE WILL PUT IN THE AND THE MEASURE OF CLOSET AT IS GOES AS IT GOES DOWN THE NUMBER IN THE FUND WILL GO DOWN -- ACCORDINGLY AS WELL IT WILL IT WILL FACE DOWN. AND THEN -- ON THE ON THE ENDS VERSES THE ORDER IT'S THE THE INTENT THAT. THE FIRST PLACE IT TOUCHES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW IT'S AS INDOOR BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY CLARIFY THAT AS WE GO ON AND AGAIN WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK WITH -- OTHER PARTNERS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND THAT THEIR CONCERNS. WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER GARVEY HAVING. TO COME UP JUST REALLY BRIEFLY -- YEAH I THINK WE HAD A LOT OF THE POINTS -- IN ON WHY THIS IS A WORTHY -- OBJECTIVE IN AGAIN WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY.

AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN IS A CLEAN A BILL THAT AB. TWO SIX TWO I RESPECTFUL -- WE HAVE ONE WITNESS WILL ALSO BE BRIEF AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER MR. I WOULD BE VERY -- HELLO MY NAME IS LIZ ALLEN I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ALLIANCE&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE COOK ALLIANCE WAS THE PRIMARY SPONSOR OF AB SIXTY SIX THE HOMEMADE FOOD OPERATIONS ACT -- AND WAS WORKING ON LEGALIZING HOME COOKING FOR THREE YEARS WE REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF COOKS COMMUNITY ORGANIZER'S FARMERS SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. LEGALIZING HOME COOKING AS A BROAD SUPPORT ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN FACT LAST YEAR SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CALL THE ROAD THERE LIKE IT OFFICIALS IN OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS. SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIXTY SIX SINCE AB SIXTY SIX ONE TWO AFFECT IN JANUARY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH COUNTIES INTERESTED ON INFO ON IMPLEMENTING THIS -- IN ISSUING HOME COOKING PERMITS HOWEVER IT'S KIND OF BEEN REALLY SLOW TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION AROUND BOTH JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. AND SOME PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS. SO IT THIS BILL SO THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SLOW THE IMPLEMENTATION IN MANY COUNTIES EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING THIS THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR THOUSANDS OF COOKS EVEN THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THIS AB SIXTY SIX UNANIMOUSLY LAST YEAR. HE SUPPORTERS CONTINUE TO BE EXCITED TO EMBRACE THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE BELIEVE THAT AB THREE SEVEN SEVEN ONE BLOCK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIXTY SIX BECAUSE IT CREATES MORE CLARITY. AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW IT COUNTIES AND OF COURSE THE FOUR CITIES -- CAN OPT INTO THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANKS TO THE TIRELESS COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND HOME COOKING ADVOCATES THREE SEVEN SEVEN ACTUALLY REPRESENTS ALL INTERESTS. AND THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH SAFEGUARDS EXPEDITED OPTION AND LESSEN THE RISK OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. COURSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING HOME COOKS WHICH ARE MOSTLY WOMEN IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TO USE THEIR SKILLS. TO GENERATE INCOME. AND BRIEFLY JUST TO GO OVER WITH THE BILL CALL CALL -- FLIES -- IT SAYS IT SAYS WHICH JURISDICTIONS ARE ABLE TO OFTEN AT TALKS ABOUT HOW STANDARDS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT COOKS AND CONSUMERS.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE JUST RIGHT WAYS -- DAVE JONES ABOUT CITY SOUTH PASADENA -- THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE UNDERLYING BILL AND WE THOUGHT THAT THE DIRECTION THE BILL WAS TO ALLOW JURISDICTIONS TO OPT OUT. BY THEIR CHOICE THE WITH THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN THE COUNTY CHIU STOPPED AND AND THE CITY OF TRACY OPTED OUT. FOR YOU SEE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE IN THE BILL SO THE WEIGHTS BILLS CURRENTLY CRAFTED IF YOU HAVE JURISDICTION THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL LIKE SELF PASSED VERY SMALL -- NOT SEE A LOT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ATTENTION FROM LA COUNTY -- THEY WOULDN'T DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING FOR THIS DECISION TO BE MADE FOR THAT BECAUSE THE BILL MAKES IT VERY CLEAR. THAT IF YOU -- IF THE COUNTY OF LA OPT IN NO SNOW LOCAL JURISDICTION IN LA COUNTY CAN OPT OUT. SO THOSE ARE BASIC CONCERNS THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD QUESTIONS FROM DIVERSE. WAS NOT A QUESTION JUST A COMMENT IS A FANTASTIC BILL NO I'M IN FACT -- IF YOU BELIEVE IN LIBERTY THIS GETS MORE LIBERTY IF YOU BELIEVE IN SMALL BUSINESSES THIS ACTUALLY HELP SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE STARTING -- THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL I'D LOVE TO BE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE AUTHORED MIGUEL BUT I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR -- IT'S IMPORTANT MID TO RELAYING THAT COMMENT YEAH. NICELY DONE TODAY BY THE WAY. OTHER OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SEE SEE NONE WILL -- I WAS IT WILL ASK THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS -- OF THE IT AS THE BILL AS IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WAS AWARE OF SO THAT THAT WAS A CONCERN SO IF I MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE BUT BUT THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- AND WE WILL ASK THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO LOOK LOOK AT THAT ISSUE GOING FORWARD SO -- LOOKING FOR WE HAVE A MOTION -- MY MISTER FLORA A SECOND BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER SANTIAGO THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO PREPARATIONS ARE SUCH LAST WHEN I VOTE -- MR TRIPLET CALL THE ROLL.

THAT HAS THIRTEEN VOTES A BILLABLE LEVINE WHO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON MR SUCH AS WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL AB. FOUR OH SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'LL ATTEMPT TO BE BRIEF AND AND THEREFORE IT'S JUST SAY THAT I WANT EXCEPT THE IN -- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- WE OF WITNESSES WILL ALSO BE BRIEF BUT ADDRESS THE ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH I THANK HIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION WITH THE CHAIRS AND DALTON SO MAKE BRIEF REMARKS ON THAT I WILL TAKE FROM OUR SECOND WITNESSES TIME. THAT -- THIS BILL ALLOWS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY FOR DOCTORS AND PODIATRISTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE PERMISSION TO USE FLORA SKIPPY IN SURGERY. THE CURRENT -- PROCESS BY WHICH YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STATE CERTIFIED TEST IS CUMBERSOME FOR OUT OF STATE DOCTORS BECAUSE THAT TESTING PROCESS BECAUSE OF MEAN -- IT'S UP TO SIX MONTHS WARNING OUT OF STATE POSITION. AT TO GET THAT CERTIFICATION PROCESS BECAUSE SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ON HOSPITALS AND OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTERS NOW REQUIRE ANNUAL TRAINING. OF PHYSICIANS REGARDING -- FLUOROSCOPY AND PATIENT HEALTH THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW BACK ANNUAL TRAINING TO SUBSTITUTE FOR TAKING IN PASSING THAT TEST AS WELL AS FOR ONGOING MEDICAL EDUCATION -- I WILL PASS THIS OVER -- TO DR AND RUSSELL NORD AND THEN -- JESSE SCOTT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ARE ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS RUSSELL NORTON -- ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON PRACTICING IN BONTA ALAMEDA COUNTY I'M ALSO THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS OUR STATES ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS. SO JUST AS AN INTRODUCTION FOR OSCAR B. IS ESSENTIALLY AN X. RAY WITH SOME SPECIAL FEATURES -- SPECIFICALLY IT ALLOWS REAL TIME IMAGING WITH THERE'S NO DELAY AFTER ACTUALLY SHOT BEFORE THE IMAGES SEEN. SECONDLY IT'S EXTREMO BILE WITH MULTIPLE DEGREES OF FREEDOM AN AXE AND MANEUVERABILITY WHICH MAKES IT VERY USEFUL TO GET SPECIFIC X. REVIEWS ON A PATIENT WHO'S A MOBILE SUCH AS ONE ON THE OPERATING ROOMS DURING SURGERY. THIRDLY -- THE FROST MACHINE WE USED TO DO LIVE ACTUARIES WERE RATHER JUST GETTING A STATIC IMAGE -- ON AN X. RAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO A SHORT VIDEO WHICH CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT IN DOING CERTAIN SURGICAL PROCEDURES. FOR THESE REASONS FOR US TO BE HAS BECOME A CRITICAL AND UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED TOOL WITH AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AS WELL AS OTHER SPECIALTIES WITHIN MEDICINE. AND IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS I ALLUDED TO IN THE OPERATING ROOM. IN FACT IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE WHO'S EVER HAD A SURGERY FOR A BROKEN BONE WITH SOME METAL AND PLANTED IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THE FEROCITY WOULD HAVE BEEN USED DURING THAT PROCEDURE -- WE HANDED OUT SOME X. REVIEWS -- THAT SHOW FIRST A HIP FRACTURE IN THE ONE I IMAGE WITHOUT ANY METAL OR WHITE IN IT. ON OF THOSE WERE DISTRIBUTED. BUT ANYWAY -- THEY MAKE THE ENEMY THANK YOU. AND THE OTHER IMAGE SHOWS -- THE REPAIRED BONE WITH A ROD AND SOME SCREWS IN PLACE THE FLUOROSCOPY IS CRITICAL DURING THE SURGERY TO DO THIS FIRST TO MAKE SURE THE BONES ARE ALIGNED PROPERLY BEFORE THE PLACE IN THE HARDWARE. AND SECONDLY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HARDWARE IS IMPLANTED PROPERLY -- SO THAT THE BONES WITH YOUR WHOLE CORRECTLY. ON THE CORRECT POSITION AND NONE OF THE HARDWARE WILL BE PROMINENT IN THIS INSURES THAT THE PATIENT RECOVERS WELL HAS GOOD FUNCTION. AND DOESN'T REQUIRE SECONDARY SURGERIES. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM. EVERYONE AGREES IT FOR US TO BE AS NECESSARY AND ONE ALSO AGREES THAT HAS TO BE USED SAFELY. WHICH IS WHY PHYSICIANS WHO USE FOR US TO BE I HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY FOR THIS. THE PROBLEM IS THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR FLUOROSCOPIC CERTIFICATION TESTING IN CALIFORNIA IS PROBLEMATIC WHEN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES OFTEN TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. WELL THEY RECEIVE THEIR CALIFORNIA MEDICAL LICENSE THE FLASK WE CERTIFICATION PROCESSING OFTEN TAKES LONGER PRECLUDING THE SURGEON FROM TAKING THE EMERGENCY ROOM CALL. THAT THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT INTO TAKE BECAUSE TO TREAT THOSE PATIENTS IN THAT YEAR WITH THE FRACTURES -- THE NEED TO HAVE THE FEROCITY CERTIFICATION TO DO THE SURGERY -- TO TREAT THOSE INJURIES NOW OFTENTIMES THESE OR THE PEAKS WITH HIS HAVE USED FOR US TO BE IN OTHER STATES FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT NEEDING A SPECIAL CERTIFICATION WHEN THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA THIS IS NEEDED. AND A RETREATS A BARRIER THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION IS GONE COMPLAINTS FROM WITH BIG SURGE OF THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE TEST ME CUMBERSOME. AND TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS WE'VE HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM NAPA FRESNO REDLANDS SANTA BARBARA CAPITAL SAM CISCO LOS ANGELES. AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS WE SEE IS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM THE DELAYS ACCESS TO CARE. ALL THE OTHER STATES IN THE UNION HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO SAFELY USE LOST WITHOUT THE SORT OF PROCESS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP US MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD SO WE CAN JOIN THAT GROUP THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORT. MY NAME IS JESSE SCOTT IN THE ADMINISTRATOR AT PRESIDIO SURGERY CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LAST YEAR JOINT COMMISSION WHO SURPRISEUS CAME OUT WITH A NEW REQUIREMENT FOR US TO DEVELOP AN EDUCATION MODULE FOR THE PHYSICIANS AND FOR THE STAFF. ARE THEY POINTED US IN THAT EDUCATION MODULE TO IMAGE GENTLY AN IMAGE WISELY WHICH ARE WHAT THE RADIOLOGY SOCIETIES HAVE PUT OUT AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION THEY WANT. INFORMATION FROM THOSE SITES AND THEN HAD OUR CONSULTANT RADIOLOGIST PUT IN INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE MACHINES THAT THE PHYSICIANS WOULD USE AT OUR CENTER. AND THAT'S NOT PART OF OUR ORIENTATION FOR ANY NEW POSITION COMING ON AS WELL AS FOR STAFF OR ANY KIND OF LICENSED INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER. AND IT'S PUT OUT ANNUALLY FOR REVIEW WE WOULD IT WILL BE IT WILL BE ANNUAL WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET BECAUSE IT'S NEW. BUT IT WILL GET UPDATED ANNUALLY AND RE SENT OUT TO THE PHYSICIANS WHO ATTEST THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH IT AGAIN -- SO IT'S NOT A HARDSHIP FOR THE FACILITY TO DO [inaudible] THROUGH MUCH. OTHERS THE SUPPORT. SPENCER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRETTY AFTER MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHERE THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. DIANNE CHIP YOU TO SKI I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANKS. MR TURN MEMBERS BOB ACURA BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY. WE'RE GOING TO WE WERE OPPOSED WE OF UNDERSTAND THE THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE COMPLEX IS THE PROCESS WOULD WELCOME -- ANY REFORM THAT EFFORT THE TEST IS ADMINISTERED BY AN OUTSIDE NATIONALIZATION. WAS THE WEARABLE THE TIME FRAME ISSUES BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD SUPPORT -- REVISIONS ON THE TEST ITSELF IS SOMETHING THE MEASURE THE COMPETENCY THE POSITION THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF RADIATION SAFETY AND RADIATION DOSE -- AS THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON TESTIFIED FOR OSCAR B. AS A REAL TIME IMAGE STANDING ON THAT PEDAL TOO LONG EXPOSE THE PATIENT NECESSARILY TO EXCESS RADIATION. AS WELL AS POSITION THEMSELVES SO HAVING THAT KNOWLEDGE WE THINK IS ESSENTIAL TO APPROPRIATE -- USE OF THE EQUIPMENT FOR IN PATIENT PROTECTION. THE PHILOSOPHY PERMIT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION THAT TRAINING EDUCATION WAS ON EVEN IN THE STATE SO MODEL SYLLABUS WAS DEVELOPING A TEST WAS CREATED. BUT HAS BEEN MODIFIED THE PASS RATE IS 83% THE LAST TWO YEARS SO I WAS OF THE TEST ITSELF IS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT GETTING TO THE TEST SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM. SO WOULD WELCOME THAT EFFORT TO REFORM IT THINK THE PERMIT PROCESS IS LEGITIMATE REGIONAL FOR PATIENT PROTECTION. THE NEW JAYCO REQUIREMENTS ARE HEADING TOWARDS MORE DOCUMENTATION NOT LESS SO I THINK CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE BEEN OUT IN FRONT OF THIS ISSUE BUT PROBABLY OTHER STATES GOING TO CATCH UP. IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE PLACED OPPOSITION SO REGRETFULLY REPOSE THE CURRENT VERSION THANK YOU. Q. QUESTIONS CONCERN FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR MAKES. YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE -- SPEED OF DIFFICULT THE BOMB. AND IN I ALWAYS WONDER IT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION WHY THE RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY WOULD WOULD BE OPPOSE IS IT. IS IT TRULY BECAUSE OF THIS PERMIT PROCESS OR IS THERE SOME OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST ON THAT IS GUIDING OF THE IT GOT IN THE OPPOSITION -- SO IT IS OR SOMEONE A WORKAROUND IS TO GET YOU TO SUPPORT. WELL I I DON'T THINK WE WOULD THERE'S NO ECONOMIC AUTOMATION A RADIOLOGIST OF THE PRIMARY PROVIDERS IMAGE SERVICES YOU KNOW AND PROBABLY DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF FLUOROSCOPY BUT IN THE SURGERY SUITE IS THE SURGEON DOING IT. AND THE PODIATRY -- SURGICAL OFFICE IT'S A PODIATRIST WE ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT SHOULD HAVE. A PRACTITIONER KNOWLEDGEABLE OF RADIATION DOSE AND SAFETY IT'S NOT SOMETHING IT'S INDICATIVE OF THOSE SPECIALTIES IT IS FOR RADIOLOGY. BUT THE TEST AND 83% PASS IS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT. AND SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE IN TERMS OF EDUCATION SO. IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF GETTING TO A POINT WHERE THE PHYSICIAN CAN ACCOMPLISH THE PERMANENT TIMELY BASIS AND WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT -- THAT'S MORE THE BUREAUCRACY AND NOT SOMETHING WE CONTROL -- IMAGE WISE IT WAS MENTIONED RADIOLOGIST THE FOREFRONT OF REDUCING THE DOSE MAKING THE DOES THE MINIMUM NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THE DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSE. SO WE'RE NOT THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RUN OTHER PHYSICIANS FROM PRACTICING AT ALL. THE ANSWERS A QUESTION WOULD IMAGES TO THE I THINK THE RADIOLOGIST SO OBVIOUSLY -- SPECIALISTS BY HERE AND HAVE THE THE KNOWLEDGE IN ANY INSIGHT -- AND AND SO IT'S TO ME IT'S IT'S IT'S A CONCERN THAT YOU GUYS ARE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TO BE ABLE TO GET -- YOU KNOW TO WHERE YOU GUYS CAN GET TO A SUPPORT POSITION. I DON'T KNOW IS THAT THE AUTHOR OF YOU GUYS HAVING CONVERSATIONS WE CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THEM TO WELL -- I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND THEY LET LET ME FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THAT I WOULD BE WITH ANY STANDARDS TRAINING SAFETY. A MEASURE THAT AT THAT -- THAT THEY WOULD PUT ON THE TABLE -- WHEN I AGREED TO TAKE THE BILL I KIND OF I CAN LOOK AT THIS AND THOUGHT IT WAS AND -- GOOD EFFICIENCY BILL SO IF YOU HAVE TESTING THAT IT THAT THAT IS STATE MANDATED IN NOW THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO DO THIS SORT OF TRAINING. EVERY YEAR -- WE CAN EASILY WORK ON CHANGING THE TRAINING AT THE HOSPITAL IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THAT IS SEEN IS DEFICIENT -- FROM THE RADIOLOGIST PERSPECTIVE BUT WHY IF THE TRAINING OF THE HOSPITAL AND THE DOCTOR HAS TO THE TRAINING AT THE HOSPITAL THEY WERE GONNA SEND OF THE STATE -- THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WHEN WE COULD JUST DO AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY'RE DOING THEIR I MEAN I HAVEN'T. WE ALSO TOOK A BECAUSE I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN INTEREST MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAD A INJURY LAST YEAR THEY WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS. I KEPT THINKING MYSELF BUT IF I GET REDUCE ONE MORE BARRIER TO HAVE A A DOCTOR IS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL -- WORKING OF THINGS ARE IMPORTANT AS OPPOSED TO DRIVING IN TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CUMBERSOME PROCESS WHY NOT. OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NONE I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS AND AND THE COUNTRY RESOLUTION THE BILL DOES ENJOYED DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- WHICH I CLOSE MISTER SANTIAGO I RESPECT UNANSWERED AYE VOTE AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORK ON THIS THANK YOU -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY -- MISTER RAMOS THE SECOND BY MISTER NAZARIAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS.

TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MANAGED MANAGED CARE PLANS REDUCE HELP REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE BILL WILL REQUIRE DH CS TO SET A MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL THAT IMPROVES QUALITY IT REDUCES HEALTH DISPARITIES IT WILL ESTABLISH A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO REWARD MANAGED CARE PLANS. THAT MEET PERFORMANCE TARGETS THAT EXCEED THE NEW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE AYE VOTE WE HAVE WE DO HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS -- MARKETS GOT THROWN THE CALIFORNIA BENNETT NICK HEALTH NETWORK -- PLEASE BE A CO SPONSOR OF AB -- FIVE THREE SEVEN I'LL JUST GIVE A VERY BRIEF -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE ACS IS LATEST COMMITMENT TO INCREASING -- THE M. P. L. -- IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT AUDITOR'S REPORT -- WE BELIEVE MORE IS NEEDED -- SUCH AS CREATING THE A NEW ME M. P. L. WITH THE STAKEHOLDER. INPUT THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS THAT WILL DRIVE QUALITY IMPROVE HEALTH DISPARITIES -- HEALTH PLANS HAVE REAP SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL REWARDS FOR SERVING CALIFORNIANS IN MEDI CAL -- YEAH FOR CALIFORNIANS ON MEDI CAL HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE STILL DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S A CODES -- RACE GENDER WHAT LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK -- EVERYONE DESERVES QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD A HEALTHIER LIFE FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB FIVE THREE SEVEN AND REQUEST DRIVE UP. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK -- IN SUPPORT OF THE ROOM PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR -- THE BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T MEASURE AND WE HAVE. TOWN HALL MEETINGS ALMOST EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND OF AMONG THE TOP FIVE CONCERNS IS FIXING THE SYSTEM IN A PART OF FIXING THE SYSTEM IS HOLDING AN ACCOUNTABLE. SO THE ASPECTS OF THE BILL THE REQUIRE REPORT ASSESS AND THEN UTILIZE THE DATA AND ALSO PROVIDES INCENTIVES -- TO END HEALTH DISPARITIES IS IMPORTANT TO US AND FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE ARE TRYING TO VOTE. THANK YOU ALL MOVED TO ADDITIONAL. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD CO SPONSOR HIV. FANTASTIC -- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JOSE TOWARDS WITH HEALTH ACT THE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GALEANO CHILDREN ON SUPPORT. GREAT SEEING IN NEW. AND FURTHER WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COME ON FORD [inaudible] THANK YOU. WELL I'M JENNIFER ONLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. TO DISCUSS THIS BILL OF THIS EVENING -- MY NUMBERS ARE YOU KNOW CAP REPRESENTS HEALTH PLANS THAT YOU KNOW PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WE HAVE FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT PLANS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP AND THEY ARE COMMITTED. TO IMPLEMENTING THE NEW QUALITY REQUIREMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT WE OPPOSE LAST YEAR AND I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES BETWEEN. THE BILL LAST YEAR IN THIS YEAR'S AND MARCH OF THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES COMPLETELY REVAMPED AND REVITALIZED THE QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN RIGHT WE TALK ABOUT QUALITY WANT TO TREAT SURGERY THINGS THAT YOU MEASURE THAT. PROVIDERS ARE DOING THEY CAN KIND OF GIVE YOU -- AN INSIGHT INTO HOW POPULATION HEALTH THIS SO YOU LOOKING YOU FIND OUT OUR KIDS GETTING THERE -- IMMUNIZATIONS ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING YOU KNOW OTHER PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS THAT WERE AT THEIR REQUIRED TO GET AND SO WHAT THAT THE STATE ORDERED THE PLANTS TO DUE IN MARCH. WAS TO UTILIZE THE ENTIRE COURSE AT THAT'S PUBLISHED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND EMBER. OF MEDICAID SERVICES WHICH WAS A HUGE CHANGE -- THAT'S INCLUDED A LOT MORE MEASURES THAT WERE. BEING MEASURED BY PLANTS PRIOR TO THAT CHANGE AND THEY ALSO RAISE THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LETTER LEVEL FOR PLANTS FROM NEEDED TO BE IN THEIR QUALITY EFFORTS. AND THEY MADE THESE REQUIREMENTS RECTAL RECTOR. RETROACTIVE. TO JANUARY OF THIS YEAR IN THE END OF MARCH AND SO MY MEMBERS ARE VERY ENGAGED IN IN IMPLEMENTING THESE. INVOLVES CHANGING ON HOW THEY COLLECT DATA FROM PROVIDERS H. EDUCATING PROVIDERS THAT THEY NEED TO SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION. AND IT'S A HUGE LIVE FOR THEM AND THEY'RE VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT WORK AND SO -- TO REQUIRE THAT A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BE DEVELOPED TO CREATE A NEW QALITY PROGRAM IS A PROBLEM FOR US BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL LINE WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW -- PROCESS OUTLINES THAT I JUST THAT COVERED -- AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS -- FOR HEALTH PLANS ON HOW THEY NEED TO REPORT THEIR DATA -- SOME OF THE INFORMATION -- IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT THEY WANT HEALTH POINT MINT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT GET IT. FROM THE FILE OF OUR ENROLLEES THAT JUST THEIR PROCESS TO THE COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS A FAST. AND SO TO SET AN EXPECTATION OF THAT WE WOULD -- PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION ON OUR ROLE IS THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE KIND OF PUT THIS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE QUALITY OF THOSE REPORTS ONCE THEY BEGIN BEING PUBLISHED. AND SO -- WE DO A LIKE THE APPROACH TO INCLUDE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR PLANTS THAT EXCEED THEIR QUALITY LEVELS THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE WE DON'T OPERATE ON THAT NOW WERE FINED BY THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE DON'T NEED IT. AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO DO WITH OUR PROVIDERS AND SO WE'RE INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING THAT BUT FOR THIS AT THIS TIME WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO DISPEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THERE NO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. WHICH I TO CLOSE. I JUST RESPECT I'VE I'VE FOR SHADE WHERE THE HEALTH PLANS ARE COMING FROM -- I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH -- WITH THE THE IS THE INCENTIVE FOR A PROGRAM TO REWARD MANAGED HEALTHCARE PLANS THAT. THAT MEET NEW PERFORMANCE TARGETS I THINK IS IS -- IS SOMETHING THAT IS MORE OF A CHARACTER THAN A STICK. AND MY HOPE IS THAT -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT -- WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THIS OUT WITH PLANTS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD WE DO YOU -- HAVE A MOTION BY MISS UYGHUR CURRY AND A SECOND BY THE MISS BURKE THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT?
