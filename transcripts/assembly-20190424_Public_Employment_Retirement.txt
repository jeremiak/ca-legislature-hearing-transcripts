CURRENT LAW DEFINES TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS MERIT DISTRICTS AND NON MERIT DISTRICTS CLASSIFIED CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE CRUCIAL TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BY PROVIDING HEALTH NUTRITION AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR SERVICES. ALL THE CLASSIFIED WORK IS COMPLETED BY THE SAME STANDARD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DISTRICT IS MERIT FOR NON MERIT. NOT MERIT DISTRICTS HAVE A LONGER PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF ONE YEAR. WHERE AND MERIT DISTRICT ALLOWS FOR SIX MONTH PROBATIONARY PERIOD MY BILL AB THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE WILL BRING CONFORMITY AND CLARITY DECATUR TOUGH CLASSIFIED STAFF BY ALLOWING? FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN NON MERIT DISTRICTS TO OBTAIN PERMANENT STATUS NO LATER THAN SIX MONTHS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NON MERIT DISTRICTS ALREADY CONFORMING TO THE MERIT DISTRICT TIME LIMITS DUE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. ALIGNING BOTH OF THESE CODE SECTIONS SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE RAISED WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ENTERED INTRODUCE. OUR WITNESS CHRIS DIPLOMA. THANKING. UP MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTY BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. US STANDING IN FOR TRISTEN BROWN WHILE HE IS AWAY ON LEAVE -- WE ARE PLEASED TO BE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. THIS IS JUST ABOUT PARITY FOR CLASSIFIED SERVICE EMPLOYEES. OF THEIR WORK IS COMPLETED TO THE SAME STANDARDS WHETHER THEY WORK FOR MAYOR TO STRICT OR NON MERIT DISTRICT OF THEY SUFFER THE SAME. INSTABILITY ABOUT NOT BEING RETURNED EMPLOYMENT OVER SUMMER BREAK IT'S JUST A FAIRNESS ISSUE AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR DO HAVE SOMEBODY OR OPPOSITION. OKAY COMPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND WITH APOLOGIES TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAX ARE NOW ARE UP. A POSITION WAS TOO LATE TO BE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL I'M JEFF BACA WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS -- AT RC A WE WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE VALUE THEM VERY HIGHLY -- WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. A COMPLETE AN INTEGRATED PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL ENTERPRISE. A WE ARE CONCERNED WITH. MANDATING AND STATUTE A MAXIMUM A PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS. IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE A SIX MONTH. PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR EMPLOYEES THAT WORK FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HOURS BUT WE BUILT IN A VISION IN THE CONTRACT THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT TO BE EXTENDED FOR UP TO NINE MONTHS. IF THE EMPLOYEE IS SHOWING PROMISE BUT WE FEEL THAT NEEDS A LITTLE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF GAINING THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED. TO SUCCEED IN THE POSITION SORKIN CERTAIN REALLY IS THAT BY MANDATING WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MERIT AND NON MERIT DISTRICTS BUT BY MANDATING. THE SIX MONTH PERIOD FOR A NON MERIT DISTRICTS WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS IN FACT WILL FORCE DECISIONS ABOUT -- PERMITTED EMPLOYEES THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE DISADVANTAGES TO THOSE EMPLOYEES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DEREK CLINICS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. ARE LETTER IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THIS -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSED A FOR TWO REASONS OUR CONCERNS ARE FIRST THAT THE SIX MONTH TIME PERIOD IS SIMPLY TOO SHORT TO MAKE A PROPER EVALUATION OF THE EMPLOYEE -- BOTH OUR EMPLOYERS THAT WE'VE TALKED TO AS WELL AS SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY'VE CONFERRED WITH HAVE AGREED THAT IT MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER. TO HAVE THE SIX MONTHS ESPECIALLY WHERE SKILLED TRADES ARE INVOLVED WHERE -- COMPLEX SECRETARIAL WORK OR ANYTHING INVOLVING. ADDITIONAL TRAINING. MAY BE THAT DISADVANTAGEOUS. TO SOMEBODY WHO'S ON A LEARNING CURVE IN NEED THE ADDITIONAL TIME SO HARD SIX MONTHS IS DIFFICULT IN THAT SENSE AND THEN THE SECOND REASON IS SIMPLY BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ALREADY ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO GO TO SIX MONTHS. OF THE PRIOR WITNESS MENTIONED A NUMBER DISTRICTS GO BELOW THE TWELVE MONTHS WE THINK IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE FOR DISTRICTS IN THEIR BARGAINING PARTNERS TO WORK OUT A SHORTER TIME PERIOD -- AND AND IT YOU KNOW UNDER EXISTING LAW WE DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF A REASON TO OVERTURN THESE LOCALLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS ACROSS THE STATE -- AND SO FOR THOSE TWO REASONS REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEN HEARING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALL [inaudible] MEASURE WHAT. JUST A QUICK COMMENT TO THE AUTHOR -- JUST SO YOU KNOW I'LL BE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION HERE -- SUPPORT IN THE OFFICE OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. OKAY. UNDERSTOOD. SOME REMEMBER COOLEY HAD QUESTION. THERE'S A MOTION THEIR SECOND. SOME REMEMBER LIKE CLOSER -- AGAIN WE JUST WANT TO BRING CONFORMITY TO WHAT MANY DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY DOING HAPPY TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE OPPOSITION WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK AFTER I VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THAT I DO HAVE -- IRAQ ON THIS TO DO SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND WITH THAT SAID SECRETARY LIKE CALDERON THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND. THE MOTION IS THE PATH. RODRIGUEZ HI MY VEGAS I WILL TELL. THE BILL NO LEVINE [inaudible] COOLEY. FIVE COOLEY AYE COOPER FONG [inaudible] O'DONNELL [inaudible] O'DONNELL AYE. WITH THAT SAID THAT WILL BE THE ROLE OF THANK YOU [inaudible] IS PATTERSON. WITH THAT WE HAVE. SOME REMEMBER PATTERSON. FILE ITEM NUMBER. ELEVEN TWELVE HUNDRED GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING FOR SURE AND MEMBERS. AB TWELVE HUNDRED IS A BILL TO SIMPLY EXTEND. CRYSTAL BLOWER PROTECTIONS TO THOSE WHO CAN FIGHT IN THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OR A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. MY OFFICE HAS PERSONALLY RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM STATE WORKERS AT VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. INFORMING ME OF ISSUES AND AN APPROPRIATE ACTIVITY. HOWEVER THEY FEAR FOR THEIR JOBS AND WITHHOLD PERSONAL INFORMATION -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY DO NOT RECEIVE ANY WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONFIDING IN THE LEGISLATURE. CURRENTLY SECTION EIGHT FIVE FOUR SEVEN POINT TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE PROTECTS STATE WORKERS FROM RETALIATION WHEN THEY REPORT ILLEGAL OR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TO THE STATE AUDITOR OR THE CUT A COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. AB TWELVE HUNDRED WILL ADD THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO THIS SECTION. ALLOWING STATE WORKERS TO CONFIDE IN THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WITHOUT FEAR OF% RETALIATION. THIS LANGUAGE IS ALREADY IMPLIED IN SECTION ELEVEN OH TWO POINT FIVE OF THE LABOR CODE WHICH OUTLINES WHICH WILL WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. FOR PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITY AFTER WORKPLACE WHICH IS WHY THIS CHANGE. TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE THAT IS NECESSARY. OUT HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS A CAPTAIN HUTCHINSON REPRESENTING CSU EMPLOYEES UNION. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDES. THANK YOU. I ALSO WORK AT AT THE ISSUE TENANTS IN CAMBRIA. AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I PERSONALLY AT OUR CAMPUS WE HADN'T PLAYED UP WITH RETALIATED AGAINST THEY DID A WITH A BLOW FOR FOR THE SHERRY. AND THE MANAGER FOUND OUT INTO MODE AT THE EMPLOYEE. AND THAT A PLAY ENDED UP LEAVING -- AND SEVEN THIS ISSUE AND AND ONE BUT AT OUR CAMPUS NOW THERE'S FEAR OF ACTUALLY REPORTING A WITH A BLOW WHEN THEY SEE THINGS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE -- OUR EMPLOYEES NOW NOW IF WE CAN GO TO OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND OUR SENATORS AND TALK ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS BUT WE GO THERE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET HELP BUT THEN WE ARE TOLD THERE'S NO PROTECTION FOR US WHEN WE DO GO. SO OUR PLACE IT IN SILENCE AND SUFFER BECAUSE OF FEAR OF GOING TO THE STATE AUDITOR AND NOT HAVING THAT GUARANTEED PROTECTION THAT WHEN THEY REPORT SOMETHING. THEY WON'T BE RETALIATED AGAINST WHEN THEY GET BACK TO WORK SO THAT IS WHY THE ISSUE OF PLACING AN AND THAT. THE FISHING POLE EITHER IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE OFFICE AND OR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR YES GO AHEAD ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. I THINK THIS IS A VERY EXCELLENT BAIL. I WANNA FOR A SUGGESTED MEMON ACTUALLY I LIKE I LIKE THE BILL I LIKE THE BILL AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY. A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ON PAGES EIGHT AND NINE OF THE BILL IT'S IN PRINT THE THE AMENDMENTS. ON APRIL LATE. THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS A PARTICULAR NINETY ONE FORTY NINE POINT. TWO FOUR POINT. TWO FIVE AND POINT. TWO SIX THAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE SERVED TO GIVE DIRECTION THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW THEY HANDLE THESE SORTS OF THINGS. SO I THINK THE BILL IS IS BEFORE US IS EXCELLENT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A MOTION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THAT WE MOVING OUT TODAY AMENDED TO REINSTATE. NINETY ONE FORTY NINE POINT. TWO FOUR TWO FIVE AND TWO SIX AS THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY IN THE BILL. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND. AND WITHOUT SOME REMEMBER YOU WANTING TO TO THAT YET. ABSOLUTELY -- I WANT. TO THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND ALSO -- TO THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE AND MISSED COOLEY -- WE APPRECIATE THE POLISHING IN THE SHINING IN THE AND THE WORKING THIS BUILT A TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER.

NINE FOUR NINE ONE FOUR NINE POINT TWO FOUR POINT TWO FIVE AND POINT. TWO SIX AND WITH THAT WE DO HAVE THE MOTION SECOND SO SECRETARY LIKE KALRA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. RODRIGUEZ I REGUS AYE PROPEL I HELLO I LEVINE. COOLEY AYE COOLEY AYE COOPER FONG. FONG I O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL THANK THANK YOU MISTER APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU OKAY WE'LL GO AHEAD WITH THE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE A. B. TWELVE TWELVE AM STORING SO WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR GO YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS AB TWELVE TWELVE WOULD REQUIRE A STATE AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO PRODUCE A LIST OF PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR FUNDING CONSIDERATION. BY PUBLIC PENSION RETIREMENT BOARDS AND TO PROVIDE IT TO THEM. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE A STATE AGENCY TO PROVIDE FURTHER PROJECT INFORMATION TO A BOARD ONLY UPON REQUEST THE BILL DOES NOT. REQUIRE ANY RETIREMENT BOARD TO ACT IN ANY WAY ON THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE STATE AGENCY. AS THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION NOTES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT DOES NOT FORCE THE HANDS. OF THE PENSION SYSTEMS TO MAKE UNWISE INVESTMENTS. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO PROACTIVELY PROVIDE THE PENSION SYSTEMS WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE SOUND INVESTMENT DECISIONS. CALIFORNIA HAS A LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING GAP THAT IS GROWING EVERY DAY. CALIFORNIA FORD ESTIMATES THAT THE STATE WILL NEED TO SPEND. EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE JUST TO MEET OUR WATER pINFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. LAST YEAR THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION SUBMITTED THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. THAT FOCUSES LIMITED AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON CORE STATE RESPONSIBILITIES. AS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FURTHER NOTED THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF KEY PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IS A CORE FUNCTION OF STATE GOVERNMENT. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A TO BE TO BE CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG OF MAINTENANCE ON EXISTING FACILITIES AFTER YEARS OF UNDER FUNDING. THIS BILL COULD HELP REMEDY SOME OF OUR CRITICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES WITH ME TODAY IS STILL IN GIVENS OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. WHAT? CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DON'T GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I'D WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THAT TOO OFTEN WE'RE WE'RE SEEING LEGISLATION COME BEFORE THIS THIS COMMITTEE -- THAT TELLS CALPERS HOW TO NOT SPEND THEIR MONEY -- TELLS THEM HOW NOT TO INVEST. IN AND THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDING INFORMATION. TO TO CALPERS GIVING THEM. THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT MONEY WOULD STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA GO TOWARDS CALIFORNIA JOBS. BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. IT THIS TYPE OF OF OF LEGISLATION AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INVESTMENT IN PROVIDING THE TOOLS NECESSARY. IS VITAL TO OUR PENSION SYSTEMS AND FOR THAT WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. DEAN HEDGING SILICON CALIFORNIA CITIES ALLOW MY COMMENTS WITH THE SPECIAL DISASSOCIATION APART TO SEE THIS -- THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IS MEASURE. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATE SOME REMEMBER LIKE CLOTHES.

NECESSARY TO FORM THEIR OWN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT UNDER EXISTING LAW BARGAINING UNITS FOR SUPERVISOR PEACE OFFICERS AT THESE DISTRICTS MUST HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY SUPERVISORY OFFICERS. ADD THERE ARE NO OTHER FORTY NINE K. THROUGH TWELVE ANGRY CULTURES TRICKS THAT MAINTAIN POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND ONLY ONE IN PLACE MORE THAN A MINIMUM OF TWENTY OFFICERS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. IN THOSE REMAINING DISTRICTS ARE THE SUPERVISORS OFTEN BELONG TO UNITS REPRESENT MISCELLANEOUS NON SWORN EMPLOYEES THIS MAY RESULT LACK OF APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION SINCE PEACE OFFICERS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND INTERESTS AND THOSE OF NON SWORN EMPLOYEES. CLASS FOR MY VOTE. ANYONE ELSE SPORT. THE RAINY PERIOD ON BEHALF OF PORAC IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IS MEASURE.

COOLEY AYE COOPER [inaudible] FONG. FONG NO O'DONNELL [inaudible] O'DONNELL AYE. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND HOLD THAT ON WILL OPEN HOLD ON CALL SO WITH THAT YOU'RE READY FOR NEXT. ONE I'M ALWAYS READY FOR THE NEXT. ONE ALL OF YOU CLEARLY ARE NOT. AB -- NINE SIXTY NINE IS MY YEARLY EFFORT TO ALLOW OUR STAFF THE SAME EXACT RIGHT THAT EVERY OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEBTS AND THAT IS THE RIGHT IF THEY SO CHOOSE. TO ADD. COLLECTIVELY BUT IT TO YOU FORMER UNION COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN I THINK IT IS THE HEIGHT OF HYPOCRISY THAT WE CONTINUE -- TO INSURE THAT. BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES HAVE THAT RIGHT IN pCALIFORNIA AND WE I ATTESTED BEAN -- SUPPORTIVE OF THAT RIGHT YET OUR OWN WORKERS DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT AND SO AT IT LAST YEAR BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND I A I THINK THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT IT WAS A BILL THAT I ONLY SUPPORTED -- THIS YEAR WE HAVE TWELVE CO AUTHORS SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE IS A GROWING DESIRE IN THIS BUILDING -- TO GIVE WORKERS A VOICE ON THE JOB INCLUDING OUR OWN JOB SITE I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR THAT REALLY SHOW US HOW IMPORTANT A BILL LIKE THIS IS. A BETTER NOW SAYS TALKS AT INTERESTINGLY ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED FOR I ANYONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS KNOWS THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS BEYOND WAGES. THAT THAT WORKERS US SOMETIMES BARGAINED FOR OBVIOUSLY I'M WORKPLACE RULES SAFETY STANDARDS. CALENDARS YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WORKERS SHOULD HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOBFOR AND I WOULD NOTE IN PARTICULAR THAT IF I WERE REPUBLICAN STAFF AND SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION. WHEN -- A NUMBER OF THEM SCRAMBLED TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH OUR FUTURE THAT PERHAPS THOSE RULES LAID OUT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THEM A LITTLE BETTER. THAN ARE OUT WILL STATUS NOW I'M OUR WORKERS DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR WHEN WE SAY WE OF FIXED. WHICH WE HAVE NOT -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISSUES IN THIS BUILDING THAT WAS UNILATERALLY DONE BY MEMBERS BY THE BOSS IN AND PLACED UPON THE WORKERS WITHOUT THEIR INPUT EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AN ANONYMOUS SURVEY WHICH WE ALL KNOW. OUR MOST OF OUR WORKERS DO NOT BELIEVE WAS TRULY ANONYMOUS SO THE FACT THAT WE RUN AN ORGANIZATION THAT. ARE NOT ONLY DOESN'T ALLOW WORKERS TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAINING UNIONIZE BUT ALSO AT BELIEVES THAT -- WE ARE EXEMPT FROM MANY OF THE WORKPLACE RULES THAT WE HAVE DEFINED IN LAW IN AN OFTEN -- THAT IS THE RESPONSE OF ROLES WHEN WHEN WE HAVE WORKERS OR THEIR SUPERVISORS GO AND ASK WHY WE HAVE A CERTAIN SITUATIONS IT IT IS OFTEN THE RESPONSE THAT WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ON STATE LAWS THAT WE ACTUALLY PASS. SO ONCE AGAIN. ME AND MY TWELVE CO AUTHORS I ASK FOR AT LEAST A MOTION TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THIS BUILDING A ONE OTHER. NOTE ON THE ANALYSIS AS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN AND THAT IS. HUMOROUS OF COURSE WE NEVER KNOW IT AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT IT WOULD BE UP TO THE WORKERS TO DECIDE IF THEY WANTED. TO JOIN A JOINED TOGETHER FORM A UNION AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED SO WE ARE JUST ASKING FOR ODD THIS COMMITTEE. TO MOVE ALONG A BILL THAT WOULD GIVE OUR WORKERS THAT VERY BASIC RIGHT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MR MEMBERS BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. WE WANT TO APPLAUD THIS ACTIVE DOLLARS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AGAIN. LET'S SAY A PLOY EASE OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN. ALL THE ALL THE RIGHT AND POWER TO BE ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. OUR STATE IS GOVERNED BY THREE BRANCHES STATE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL STATE AND YOU THIS EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ALREADY GRANTED THE THE THE POWER TO THE TO UNIONIZE. IT'S TIME TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEE TO THAT SAME I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT BECAUSE I HAVE TO COLLEAGUES HERE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MY TIME WITH THEM THANK YOU. NEXT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND WE ARE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT SIMPLY GIVES WORKERS. THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO HAVE A UNION AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN -- AND SO WE ARE SO IN SUPPORT OF THAT RIGHT FOR EVERY WORKER I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE STAFF OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION OUR UNION -- WE HAVE TWO UNIONS I AM ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF THE PACIFIC MEDIA GUILD LOCAL -- THIRTY NINE FIVE TWO ONE WE NEGOTIATE WITH AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM ART PULASKI AND ANGIE WAY -- TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WHICH IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE AND WE GET THE WORK OF THE FEDERATION DONE WE HAVE TWO BARGAINING UNITS WE HAVE A GREAT CONTRACT WE NEGOTIATE EVERY YEAR. IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE TO BOTH REPRESENTS UNION WORKERS AND WORKERS WHO WANT A UNION AND ALSO TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS MYSELF -- AND TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COME TOGETHER WITH MY CO WORKERS. AND DECIDE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US WHAT WE PRIORITIZE WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED ON THE JOB AND EVEN AS WELL PAID PROFESSIONAL WORKERS. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE ISSUES IN OUR WORKPLACE AND IT IS SO MUCH BETTER TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM COLLECTIVELY AS A GROUP. THAN INDIVIDUALLY ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT WOULD BE WITH ART PULASKI. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT. MISSION CHAIR MEMBERS KOBE PRESIDING -- WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS CAN I WORK IN THIS BUILDING FOR A DECADE AND AND I SAW FOR TOO MANY TIMES TOO MANY THINGS HAPPENED THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED OF STAFF -- THIS BILL WOULD DEFINITELY ADDRESS THE WORKING CONDITIONS SITUATION AS WELL AS PAY DISPARITIES AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT. COME UP WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE A CONTRACT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE WORKING CONDITIONS ISSUE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE A BARGAIN IN NEGOTIATED -- WITH STAFF AND THE EMPLOYER SO WITH THAT AND FOR ALL THE PREVIOUS REASONS STATED WE'RE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] MEANWHILE PORT. YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS -- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT OUR EMPLOYEES THE FRONTLINE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BARGAIN OVER WORKER PROTECTIONS. AND SO WE THINK THAT SAME -- IT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO WORKERS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER TED TED TOP AND FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT STRONGLY AND SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. ISN'T JUST IMPORTANT TO EMPLOYEES IT HAS. FUTURE WILL BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. AS A FORMER LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEE IN THIS BUILDING AS WELL IT WOULD BE. A GOOD PROCESS TO BRING TO THE BUILDING AND TO GIVE EMPLOYEES A VOICE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. ANYONE ELSE'S WORK YEAH MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I THINK EVERYONE'S MADE THE REALLY GOOD POINTS ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THE RIGHTS. OF EMPLOYEES TO ORGANIZE AND WE SEE NO REASON WHY THESE GROUP OF WHEN UP GROUP EMPLOYEES MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THAT RIGHT WE ASK FREE EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. ANY. COMMENTS CONCERNS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN HERE IN. M. I WENT THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP EITHER WAS IT. A MENTION IN THE NOW SAYS ABOUT -- PROPOSITIONS THAT LIMIT OUR BUDGET TERRY ART BECAUSE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- ALL OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS DEAL WITH THAT OF COURSE IN THEIR OWN BARGAINING ON WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT OR BECAUSE OF THE STATE BUDGET -- THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THE UNIONS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS HAVE -- COOPER THIS BILL THIS YEAR AT ASSEMBLY WOMAN AS BURNER **** BATH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA KALRA MCCARTY SALAS A MARK STONE CERVANTES TEAM WICKS BONTA CARILLO IN SENATOR DRAW SO. ALSO NOTE ON THAT LIST THAT THERE ARE TWO MEMBERS -- ALONG WITH MYSELF OBVIOUSLY WHO STARTED IN THIS BUILDING AS ENTRY LEVEL STAFF -- FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SERVING UNDER LEGISLATORS AND AND AND FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE. GOOD BENEVOLENT -- BOSSES AND YET THEY SEE THE NEED -- TO ALLOW WORKERS THIS VERY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT I THINK I AM AS WE MOVE FOR IT WHAT ONE THING THAT WAS SAID IS IT'S GOOD FOR EMPLOYEES BUT IT'S GOOD FOR EMPLOYERS TO AND I WOULD NOTE THAT. HAVING AND I THINK ANY OF US WHO HAVE EVER TRIED -- TO TO REPLACE STAFF ON ON OUR TEAMS KNOW THAT AS OUR HR DEPARTMENT IS NOT SET UP TO UNDERSTAND HOW. TO NEGOTIATE THAT PROCESS IN A WAY THAT THAT MAKES SENSE OF FEAR OF LAWSUITS THAT FEAR OF OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE MAKES THAT UNCLEAR FOR BOTH THE WORKER AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT. I'M WORKPLACE BALANCE SO EVEN WITH BECAUSE WHERE UNDER A UNION EMPLOYEE OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT IT'S VERY CLEAR ON THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU GO THROUGH THERE'S A GRIEVANCE PROCESS THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THE EMPLOYER HAS CERTAINTY AT AND AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT THE BUILDING. AS LEGISLATORS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE PIECE TO NOTE HOWEVER AT THE END OF THE DAY. BOTTOM LINE IS I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE AS MY STAFF WOULD LIKE THE OPTION OF COLLECTIVELY BARGAINING. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WANTED BECAUSE I'M IN A BAD EMPLOYER I DON'T THINK THEY WANT IT BECAUSE I SOMEHOW DON'T LISTEN TO THEM. BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I LISTEN TO THEM I CAN'T AFFECT WORKPLACE RULES IN THIS BUILDING. SO AS AS GOOD AS I AM TO THEM I I CAN CALL RULES AND ASK I CAN COLLECTIVELY BAG FOR CHANGES -- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE A TRUE VOICE WE AS LEGISLATORS DON'T HAVE A TRUE VOICE ON EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN THIS BUILDING. ALL ON WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES ON ON UP CALENDARS IN IN AND RIGHTS IN SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE HELPLESSNESS THAT OUR WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T COME TOGETHER AND VOICE THEIR OPINION WITHOUT RETALIATION WITHOUT WORRY. AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME LEVERAGE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO HEAR I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE AFRAID OF AND I THINK UP AGAIN IF WE DON'T WANNA BE HYPOCRITES AND WE WANT TO LIVE OUR VALUES. THAT WE TREAT OUR OWN WORKERS LIKE EVERY OTHER WORKER IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AT LEAST A MOTION BUT AND I DON'T EXPECT. ONE WHAT THANK YOU REMEMBER YOUR TRULY BENNETT A TRUE CHAMPION FOR WORKERS AND IN ALL TYPES OF OCCUPATIONS NO LASHER THIS BILL CAME TO US BEFORE CAN. AT TOWARDS THE END REALLY EVEN GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT I DID SUPPORTED WITH THE CURSOR VOTE LAST YEAR. THIS TIME WE HAD MORE TIME TO LOOK AT IT I I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME MORE ISSUES COME ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION ISSUE WITH. PROP ONE FOURTEEN OTHERS WHAT THAT -- THINGS THAT MAYBE HAVE ME LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE NOW. SO FORTY BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. SO JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGS FOR TO BE THAT CHAMPION AND WITH THAT SICK AS WELL FIRST ONE WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND [inaudible] THANK YOU. MOTION SECOND I'M. OKAY WITH THAT SAID THERE IS NO SECOND IN A MOTION. SO THEY WILL NOT BE A OF ROLE ON THAT ROLL CALL ON THAT SO WITHOUT. WHAT IS OUR NEXT THE BILL WE HAVE COME FORWARD SO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER JONES SAWYER. YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT BOTTOM NUMBER NINE A.. TEN OH SEVEN SO THANK YOU AND YOU ARE READY SIR. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TEN ZERO SEVEN HELP STATE EMPLOYEES BY PROVIDING CERTAINTY IN THE DISCIPLINARY TIMELINE. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS UP TO THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION THAT MAY I REPEAT MAY RESULT IN EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE. THAT MEANS THAT A STATE EMPLOYEE PLATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY COMMITTED IN IN INAPPROPRIATE ACT MUST PUT THEIR CAREER ON HOLD. FIRST UP TO THREE YEARS THEY CAN NOT. REQUEST A RACE. REQUEST A TRANSFER OF PORT FOR FOR PROMOTION. FOR THE MORE IN CASES WHERE AN IMPROPER ACTION HAS OCCURRED THIS MEANS YOU CAN TAKE UP TO THREE YEARS BEFORE AN EMPLOYEE IS EVEN DISCIPLINE. ALLOWING THEM TO REPEAT THEIR BEHAVIOR WITH THAT HE CORRECTIVE ACTION. REDUCING THE TIME NECESSARY TO DISCIPLINE THE STATE EMPLOYEE TO ONE YEAR PROVIDES EMPLOYEES CERTAINTY ALLOWS MORE TIMELY CORRECTIVE ACTION. AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR IN PUBLIC IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS JOHN LEVEL REPRESENTING THE STATE CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS SPONSORS OF THE BILL. FOR CANNELLA IMPORT CONNECT. THANKS I DON'T OVERREACH FROM BUT REACH HERE THE CALIFORNIA. GOOD. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL ON THE LOBBYIST FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION. WITH ME IS FORD CANNOT WHO CAN ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP ON THIS. THIS IS AS MISTER JONES SAWYER INDICATED A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE. THREE YEARS TO RESOLVE A DISCIPLINE. OF THE HUMAN CONDITION BEING WHAT IT IS PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO TAKE THE WHOLE THREE YEARS. AND THAT DOES INCREDIBLE HARM TO THE EMPLOYEE AS MISTER JONES SAWYER IS POINTED OUT. HERE SHE IS VIRTUALLY FROZEN IN THEIR CAREER DURING THAT TIME AND EVEN IF AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT IS DETERMINED THAT -- HEY THERE WAS NO FAULT -- EVERYTHING IS FINE NO EVERYTHING IS IN FINE YOU GAVE THREE YEARS OF YOUR CAREER WHERE YOUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE YOUR CAREER HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY -- CURTAILED. THE ONE YEAR -- A PER OF PROVISION IN THE BILL WORKS VERY VERY WELL WITH PEACE OFFICERS RIGHT NOW THERE IS A ONE YEAR -- WINDOW AND THAT HAS WORKED EXTREMELY WELL AND IT SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED ACROSS -- CITY AND OF EMPLOYMENT -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS VOTED. FOR PREVIOUS BILLS -- ONE AUTHORED BY MISTER JONES SAWYER THAT ALSO ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY. THANK YOU NEXT A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M FOR CANNOT ADMINISTRATIVE LIAISON FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION WE REPRESENT SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS AND DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND A DEPARTMENT SHE'D HOSPITALS. OF ATOMIZED. SEVEN OF MY SEVENTEEN YEARS -- OF HANDLING CAGES FOR OUR MEMBERS WE'VE HAD MEMBERS SITTING IN ROOMS FOR TWO YEARS NOT DOING ANYTHING. JUST LIKE REVIEWING GARBAGE AND THEY MIGHT BE OF OF SUPERVISING SOCIAL WORKER OF DR -- ALL KINDS OF THINGS WAITING FOR A IT -- AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THEY WERE ACCUSED OF INEFFICIENCY OR INDISCHE. USUAL NEGLECT OF DUTY OR SOME SMALL MINISTRY OF VIOLATION. AND THE WE'RE WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF THEIR EXPERTISE ON THE JOB FOR THEM SITTING AROUND AND NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR A COUPLE YEARS. PLUS THERE ARE THEIR LIFE IS IS BEEN PUT ON HOLD. NOW IT'S KIND OF FUNNY WHEN I LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS THREE YEARS FOR WHICH IS FRAUD EMBEZZLEMENT. OF SEXUAL RESIDENTS SEXUAL ASSAULT. ALL THOSE THINGS -- MOST AGENCIES WOULD JUMP ON MEDIATE LEE AND THEY'D BE DONE WITHIN SIX MONTHS. EVEN THOUGH IT THE BILL ALLOWS UP TO THREE YEARS FOR THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET COMPLICATED. BUT ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS THE LITTLE -- LITTLE VIOLATIONS -- WE DON'T WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HOLD PEOPLE HOSTAGE FOR THREE YEARS OF FOREIGN OF SMALL VIOLATION THAT THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE. PLUS. IN MY DEALINGS WITH THEM WILL THEY GET TO STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ALMOST FOUR YEARS LATER. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE GO THROUGH SKELLY. AND THEN THEY WANT TO APPEAL IT TO THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. THE WITNESSES FOR THE STATE AND OF THE EMPLOYEE OR CHOIR -- OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE THE RETIRED MOVE DIED -- DON'T REMEMBER FOUR YEARS AGO A. H. IT'S JUST A OF A KIND OF A FARCE. AND NOT THAT WE DON'T WIN THE KATE MIGHT MY GROUP WINS THOSE KIND OF CASES ALL THE TIME. AGAINST THE STATE IS IT THE ISSUE IS MORE HURTING PEOPLE AND WE'RE NOT -- JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED SO THIS WEEK AN AND DISTRICTS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY OF DOING THINGS.
