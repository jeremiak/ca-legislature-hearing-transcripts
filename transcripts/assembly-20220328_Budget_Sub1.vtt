ABOUT THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:56.140
THREE TIMING. ON BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:58.209
NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEGIN ACTUAL

METHODOLOGY TO PROVIDE AN

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:15.760
ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.062
CLIENTS. THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:21.632
BE. IMPACTED BY THE TRANSFER AND

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:25.336
THAT NUMBER IS FORTY EIGHT

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:26.170
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX INDIVIDUALS

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.905

ON. BASED UPON THIS PARTICULAR

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:40.752
AT THE MET THIS WOULD REQUIRE

FOR SACRAMENTO AN ADDITIONAL

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:43.821

DOLLARS FOR SERVICES. ONLY AFTER

COMMITTING OF FUNDING COULD BE

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.500
BEGIN PLANNING- AT THE

00:33:55.566 --> 00:33:57.335
DEVELOPMENT OF EXTENDED NETWORK

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:00.605
AND THAT IN CAN IN A IN A COUNTY

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:04.342
WOULD TAKE. I ROUGHLY TWENTY

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:04.942
FOUR TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS THE

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:07.044
TIME IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THIS

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:08.913
IS TREMENDOUS SYSTEM BUILD OUT

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.116
AND IN SOLANO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.152
IF THE ESTIMATES PROVE ACCURATE

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.887
HI THERE IS A VERY LARGE MEDICAL

00:34:15.953 --> 00:34:18.089
FOOTPRINT AND THIS WOULD BE A

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.091
40% INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:22.927
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED BY.

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:25.797

CONTRACTING DEVELOPING SITES

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.907
HIRING ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.442
NEED TO OCCUR TO CREATE AN

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:39.944
ACCEPTABLE NOT WORK BEFORE WE

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.646
COULD BEGIN TRANSFER OF ANY

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:42.847
CLIENTS- I'M AND ONE SHOULD ALSO

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.315
NOTE THAT HIRING A BEHAVIORAL

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.783
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS VERY

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.152
DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. AND SOLANO

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.420
COUNTY HAS HAD THE EXPERIENCE

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.923
OF- POSTING OUR OF PEAS AND

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.024
HAVING NO INTERESTED BIDDERS SO

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.059
THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES THAT

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.994
NEED TO FOLLOW TO PLACE AN ORDER

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:57.862
FOR IT THIS. TRANSCRIPT HERE TO

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.898
BE SUCCESSFUL. ADDITIONALLY AND

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.600
THE PLANNING REQUIRES IMPORTANT

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.835
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE NOT YET

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:05.703
BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE REGARDING

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.738
THE KAISER CLIENTS SUCH AS-

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.440
INFORMATION REGARDING THE AGES

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:11.676
OF THE CLIENTS THEIR DIAGNOSES

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.544
AND EVEN THE CITIES WHERE THEY

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:16.013
LIVE SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE AND

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.117
FOR WHOM SERVICES. NEED TO BE

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.853
DEVELOPED AND EXPANDED. SO ONLY

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.354
APPLY AND ONLY ONCE ALL THAT

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:24.188
HAPPENS COULD BE BEGIN

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.824
TRANSFERRING CLIENTS. ON AND AT

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:28.659
THAT POINT WE ALSO WOULD

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:31.562
RECOMMEND I'M- HAVING A MONTHLY

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:34.899
CAP- NO MORE THAN 10% OF THE

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.635
ANNUAL PLAN TRANSFERRING IN ANY

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:41.772
GIVEN MONTH- THE- MS COOPER

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.908
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT- THAT

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.210
THERE ARE FUNDS- THAT ARE

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.112
INCLUDED IN THE CAPITATED RATE

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.781
THAT'S BEEN PAID TO KAISER. AND

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:53.117
IN SERVING THIS POPULATION AND

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.485
SO WE DO BELIEVE IT'S REASONABLE

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:55.953
IF THE STATE WOULD TRANSFERRED

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.122
THESE SERVICES AND IN

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:59.557
TRANSFERRING THOSE SERVICES

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:02.527
WOULD TRANSFER THE FUNDS. I TO

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.295
THE TO THE RECEIVING HEALTH PLAN

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:06.230
WHICH IS THE WHICH ARE THE TWO

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:08.900
COUNTIES- WE DO NOT LEAVE ANY

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.868
MEDIC CAL PLAN BUT AGREED TO

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:11.936
CARE FOR THOUSANDS MORE

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:14.272
BENEFICIARIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:18.442
FUNDING AND- TIME TO TRANSITION

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:22.079
. I'M WE SHOULD NOTE THAT- ONE

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.881
OF THE OP ONE OF THE OPTIONS

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:25.516
THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE STATE

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:28.085
WAS TO TRY TO GET A

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:30.288
RECALCULATION OF REALIGNMENT

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.923
DOLLARS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.991
IMPACT ALL COUNTIES AND THAT IS

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.860
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.428
WE DON'T THINK OTHER COUNTIES-

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.963
THAT ARE ALREADY STRETCHED IN

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.298
THE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS SHOULD

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.400
BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.201
NEEDS OF OUR TWO COUNTIES. WHEN

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:46.003
YOU KNOW THAT THE LAST BUDGET

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.506
CYCLE INCLUDED- SOME GROWTH FOR

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.140
OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.375
REALIGNMENT. BUT ALSO NOTE THAT

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.210
AT THE SAME TIME- THAT THIS

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:55.279
OCCURRED THE STATE IS PROPOSING

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:57.048
SEPARATE RECRUITMENT- WHICH IS

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:59.250
EQUIPPED WHICH ARE EQUIVALENT TO

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:01.953
THREE TIMES. ANY POTENTIAL

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.654
GROWTH THAT WE WILL SEE.

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.789
CONDITIONALLY BECAUSE THIS

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.624
IMPLEMENTATION IS MULTI

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:09.794
FACTORED- WE SUGGEST- IN A

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.028
REPORTING TO THE SENATE AND

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.409
QUESTION SO BORING HERE TO

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.144
SECURE MANAGEMENT- WE ARE

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.547
CURRENTLY SCHEDULING HAVING BE

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.649
ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH ECM BUCKET

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:13.718
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. CHILDREN

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.419
AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE OUR

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.021
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WOULD GO

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.724
LIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.858
THREE AND THAT WAS REALLY BASED

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.727
OFF OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.061
FEEDBACK THAT WE JUST NEED MORE

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.397
TIME. TO UNPACK ON THAT

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:28.866
PARTICULAR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.801
WHO WOULD BE IN AND OUT WHAT

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.470
DOES IT MEAN ESPECIALLY GIVEN

ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.840
THAT CAN IMPACT SOME OF OUR MOST

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:38.209
VULNERABLE. INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.143
WOULD NEED ENHANCE CARE

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.911
MANAGEMENT SO THAT'S ONE PIECE

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.313
OF ADVICE SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.215
FULL STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:46.083

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.389
HOWEVER I WOULD JUST SAY ENHANCE

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.058
YOUR MANAGEMENT IS NOT FOR

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.193
EVERYONE RIGHT I THINK IT IS

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.928
MEANT TO TOUCH THE HIGHEST MOST

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.930
COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS OFTEN WHICH

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.098
IS WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:02.299
QUESTIONS AROUND CHILDREN AND

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.101
YOUTH IN THE CHILD WELFARE.

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.503
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY ARE SOME

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.738
OF OUR MOST COMPLEX. INDIVIDUALS

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.473
AND SO WE DO ANTICIPATE A LARGE

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.208
NUMBER OF THE OF THOSE CHILDREN

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.676
WOULD NEED SOME LEVEL OF

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:13.744
ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.780

WE KNOW MORE. IN REGARDS TO THE

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.885
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:26.056
CONSULTING. WITH REGARDS ABOUT

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:28.192
THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.227
I'M GONNA DIG INTO LITTLE BIT SO

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.595
THE PAGED. OF THE- THERE TALK OF

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.830
THE IN. COORDINATION OF CARE.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.532
THE FOURTH BULLET DOWN TALKS

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:35.166
ABOUT ENSURING CONTINUOUS AND

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:37.001
INTEGRATED CARE. HOW ARE THE

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.069
PLANS ACTUALLY PLANNING TO

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.172
OPERATIONALIZE THAT WHAT DOES

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:43.374
THAT LOOK LIKE I'M- ALWAYS

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.776
WORRIED ABOUT. THE INTEGRATION

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:47.311
IT'S EASY TO SAY BUT IT'S HARD

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:49.146
TO OPERATIONALIZE WOULD LOVE

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:52.116
MORE DETAILS. I AGREE WITHYOU

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.150
1100% ON THAT COMMENT IS WHAT

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:55.152
I'D SAY BUT- SO ONE OF THE

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:56.520
THINGS THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.522
WITH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT-

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:00.024
THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.193
ANYTHING ELSE THE OTHER KIND OF

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:03.394
CASE MANAGEMENT THAT WE PROVIDE

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.696
OUR COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT-

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:06.764
WHEN SOMEONE SIGNS ON AS A

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:08.966
PROVIDER TO BE AN ENHANCED YOUR

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.134
MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. WE HAVE A

STANDARD CONTRACT FOR ALL ECM

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.038
PROVIDERS STATEWIDE REGARDLESS

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.840
OF MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT LET

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:17.341
OUTLINED THE KIND OF VERY

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.844
DETAILED EXPECTATIONS SOMEBODY

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.012
IS OUR NEED TO MEET IF THEY

MANAGER OF FOR THAT PATIENT

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:31.989
REGARDLESS OF DELIVERY SYSTEM I

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.357
THOUGHT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.359
COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ECM I

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.493
THINK CAN HAPPEN YOU KNOW

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.762

TWELVE PLUS CASE MANAGERS ACROSS

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.670
VARIOUS SYSTEMS ARE BECAUSE OF

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:47.838
THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.673
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BECOMING

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.076
AN ECM. PROVIDER MEANS THAT YOU

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:54.044
ARE WILLING TO BE THE MAIN POINT

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.713
OF CONTACT FOR THAT PERSON

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:58.215
FAMILY- TO BE ABLE TO WORKING

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:01.085
ACROSS THOSE VERY SYSTEMS ARE TO

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.519
ENSURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING A

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:04.488
CARE PLAN TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.056
OUTCOMES OF THAT INDIVIDUAL I'M

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.659
IN SO IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:09.660
REGARD. VERSUS THE OTHER TYPES

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:10.861
OF CASE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.630
HISTORICALLY FUNDED WHERE YOU

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.131
CAN HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.466
PROVIDING CASE MANAGEMENT

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:17.067

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.105
NUMBER OF OTHER CASE MANAGERS OR

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:23.107
SYSTEM. BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.775
OBLIGATION THAT THEY ARE TAKING

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:26.043
ARE WHEN THEY ARE WORKING ACROSS

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.878

MANAGEMENT PROVIDER IT'S ALSO

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.548
WHY THE POPULATIONS THE FOCUS

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.117
THAT WE HAVE ZEROED IN ON ARE

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:35.185
REALLY THOSE POPULATIONS THAT

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:36.287
ARE YOU MOST VULNERABLE IN

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.589
COMPLEX. OFTEN TOUCHING MULTIPLE

SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR MEDIC COW-

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.027
SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:44.094
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:46.497
THAT STANDARD CONTRACT LANGUAGE

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:48.032

BE OTHER THINGS ADDED AND THAT

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.414

FOR. AMERICANS OUTCOME AND WE'RE

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:06.116
TRYING TO PUSH THE INTEGRATION

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:06.917
ACROSS OUR SYSTEMS BUT IT WILL

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:08.819
BE. A CHANGE THIS WILL BE

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:10.454
DIFFERENT THIS IS HARD TO DEAL

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:12.189

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.648
OUR AND FORTHCOMING CHANGES IN

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.217
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT I

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:14.685
THINK TOUCH ON BOTH OF THE ITEMS

IT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.224
PROVIDER I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.092
FOR A TRANSITION YOU ACROSS THE

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.395
DELIVERY SYSTEM- AS WELL AS FOR

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:26.497
EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:28.198
IS IN A UP IN INPATIENT STAY

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:29.933
RECENTLY DISHED CHARGE ENSURING

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.236
THAT ON THEIR SUCCESSFULLY

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.038
WORKING WITH THAT BENEFICIARY.

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:35.305
TO WHETHER IT'S MAKE SURE MEN

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.307
RECONCILIATION HAPPENS UPON I'M

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:38.776
HOME MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:39.943
ALL OF THE SUPPORT THEY NEED

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.012
WHEN THEY TRANSITION HOME OR TO

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:42.780
IS IN ASSISTED LIVING

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:44.515
ENVIRONMENTS. WHATEVER THE

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.316
ENVIRONMENT MAY BE ON TO BE

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.751
SUCCESSFUL IN THAT TRANSITION

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.020
AND SO THAT WOULD BE A ROLE THAT

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:51.188
ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT A

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:53.957
PROVIDER WOULD PLAY ON BEFORE

THESE INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THAT'S

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.294
YOU KNOW. ALSO TO YOUR EXAMPLE A

00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.831
CRISIS UNIT SO SOMEONE WHO MAYBE

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:03.867
IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE- B. AS YOUR

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:04.935
YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WITH

SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR A

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:08.005
COMPLEX A SUBSTANCE USE

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:11.442
DISORDER. ISSUES THAT THEY HAD A

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.343
RECENT STATE OF CRISIS UNIT OF

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:21.985
THERE'S ACTUALLY DATA FEED BACK

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.454
AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE ENTITIES

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.755
TO BE AWARE OF WHEN THOSE

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.657
INSTANCES HAPPEN- I THINK YOU

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.058
KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:30.561
THAT WE KNOW. WE NEED TO IMPROVE

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.329
IS ALL OF THE VARIOUS DATA

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.864
TRACKING POINTS AND HOW DO WE

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.699
HAVE MORE REAL TIME ACCESS TO

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.969

INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CRITICAL

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.311
TRANSITIONS. ARE AWARE OF WINDY

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:48.879
SERVICES TAKE PLACE SO THAT THEY

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.848
CAN DO APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP ON

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.483
AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:53.784
INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE FUNDING

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.386
WITH HALF OF FUNDING TO BE ABLE

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.055

THAT WILL BE ROLLING OUT IN

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.477
TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONE OF THE

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:22.546
KEY ON PLACES AS AROUND A

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:23.180
STANDARDIZATION AND HIGH

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:25.149
EXPECTATIONS AROUND TRANSITIONS

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.950
OF CARE. OF WHETHER THAT IS

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.685
INPATIENT EMERGENCY ROOMS

TRANSITIONS YOU ARE MENTIONING

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.492
OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:37.828

MEET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:45.035
HAVING A- SMOOTHER AND HIGHER

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.970
QUALITY TRANSITIONS. ARE BECAUSE

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.539
THEY ARE OFTEN THE TIMES WHERE

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:49.873
OUR MOST VULNERABLE CAN FALL

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.842
THROUGH THE CRACKS IN WE DO KNOW

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:53.277
THAT IT IS A KEY IMPORTANT PART

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.012
OF THE PROVING HEALTH OUT COMES

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:55.979
IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:57.648
TRANSITIONING SOMEONE

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:58.916
SUCCESSFULLY. DO THAT NEXT. YOU

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:02.052
KNOW CONTINUE ONE. OF SERVICE. I

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:04.154
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY I WILL

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.923
MENTION WHEN WE TOWARD A CS YOU

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.125
HERE I DID NOT SEE THAT LEVEL OF

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:10.761
COORDINATION AND- REALLY WOULD

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.262
HOPE AS WERE ADVANCING AND

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.397
INNOVATING MEDIC CAL THAT WE CAN

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.899
GET THERE. WERE WERE ABLE TO

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.301
MAKE SURE WHAT YOU HAVE THE

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.902
RIGHT TO TREATMENT AT THE RIGHT

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.071
TIME AND- OFTENTIMES YOU DON'T

GET TO CHOOSE WHICH STORE.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:25.075
PEOPLE COME INTO AND- THEN WE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.810
JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.045
COORDINATING WELL AND SO THAT'S

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.446
WHY I. AM ASKING SO MANY

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:29.980

SERVICES BEFORE HAND- WILL SAY I

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.463
PREFERRED THE NEW TERM I. THINK

IT IS MORE FITTING. BUT I WOULD

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:51.635
LIKE TO ASK WHY THIS IS OPTIONAL

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.971
WHY WE HAVE CREATED SO MUCH

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:58.809
FLEXIBILITY- IS. IS IT. SO THAT

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:04.581

WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.100
HOW DO WE KIND OF MOVE THE

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.902
NEEDLE ON SOCIAL DRIVERS OF

00:48:58.969 --> 00:48:59.870
HEALTH- AND REALLY GETTING MORE

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.505
PREVENTIVE IN UPSTREAM IN A

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:03.307
COMPREHENSIVE WAY ACROSS THE

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.442
STATE- WITHIN FEDERAL GOT. THIS

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.378
OPPORTUNITY IN WHAT WE CALL AND

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:09.980
BELOVED- AND IT ALLOWED US

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.682
PRETTY BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO BE

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:13.350
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING IN

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:16.853
MEDICAID- AND REALLY SEE HOW

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.288
WOULD YOU GROW THAT ACROSS THE

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:20.157
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WE KNEW

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.925
IF WE CAME IN WITH A

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:23.060
COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FOURTEEN

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:23.960
COMMUNITY SUPPORTS ALL GOING

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:26.363
LIVE. ON AT ONE TIME- THAT WOULD

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.398
BE VERY CHALLENGING WE ALSO KNOW

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.800
THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:31.768
CURRENTLY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE.

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.203
THESE CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS ARE

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.205
CONTRACTS AND CHANGE NEEDS TO

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:38.442
HAPPEN OVER TIME- THERE IS A

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.811
CLEAR ENOUGH GUARD RAILS AND I

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.045
STRUCTURE WITHIN THE FEDERAL

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.947
GUIDANCE. THAT WE DID THINK

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:44.915
THOUGH IT IS A REALLY GOOD

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:47.217
AVENUE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.185
REALLY ADDRESS SOCIAL DRIVERS

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.354
AND HELP. INTO INVEST IN THESE

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.322
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.591
IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO BUILD

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:56.693
NETWORKS OVER TIME WHICH IS WHY

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.729
WE HAVE THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.497
NOT JUST IMPLEMENTED. THE REALLY

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:02.733
INCENTIVIZE THE UTILIZATION THE

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.468
PARTNERSHIPS THE RELATIONSHIPS

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:07.404
AS WELL AS THE- REALLY MASSIVE

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:08.905
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CHANGE

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.941
MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:13.310
THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE SUCCESSFUL

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.479
WITH THIS TYPE OF LARGE SCALE

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:18.281
CHANGE. ON THAT SO THAT'S WHY WE

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.649
WERE COMFORTABLE WITH SOME OF

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:21.885
THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE IN LIEU

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:23.954
OF SERVICES. WE DO KNOW THAT

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.989
OVER TIME WE WILL BE CONSTANTLY

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:28.625
EVALUATING IF AND WHEN WE NEED

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.694
TO SWITCH FROM WHAT IS A IN LIEU

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:31.895
OF SERVICE WHERE IT'S MORE

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.598
FLEXIBLE. TO A POTENTIAL FULL

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:36.733
TIME BENEFIT RIGHT AWAY THERE

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.669
ARE DIFFERENT OF GUARD RAILS IN

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.304
FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY- BUT FROM A-

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:42.406
FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE THEY ALSO

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:44.207
CONSIDER THIS A CAR A PART OF

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:46.510
WHAT THEY CALL CORD MEDICAID- SO

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.512
IT HAS A NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:51.748
IN GUARD RAILS WITH IT- AND SO.

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:54.117
I THINK THAT IS WHY WE REALLY

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.185
THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD STILL NEED

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:56.486
THE NEEDS OF ON ADDRESSING

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.921
SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.956
ALLOWING FOR THAT. PHASE THEN

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.425
BUILD ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:03.326
CALIFORNIA. AND ALLOWS US TO

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:09.900
KIND OF BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. NECESSARY FOR THE LONG RUN.

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.601
YOUR TO MENTION CORE MEDICAID

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:13.003
AND THAT MADE THE- FOR THE NEXT

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.271
FEW QUESTIONS I HAVE. BUT WHAT

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:17.908
HAPPENS IF THE PLANS DON'T OFFER

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:20.076
THESE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY-

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.344
SUPPORTS THAT WE'RE ALKING

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.771
OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AT THE

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.683
ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:23.985
AND WE ARE EAGER TO PRESENT OUR

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.354
PROPOSAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.054
TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM INTO A

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.556
TRULY QUALITY BASED ONE. MANY'S

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:30.725
NETWORKERS ARE BURNT OUT THEY'RE

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.326
BURNT OUT FROM UNDERSTAFFING NOT

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:33.995
BEING VALUED AND PUTTING THEIR

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.163
LIVES ON THE LINE TO CARE FOR

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.864
STATES VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THAT

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:37.899
ARE REQUIRED TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.267
CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:41.102
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT NEW

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.069
FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO HAVE FACED

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.337
THESE CHALLENGES LONG BEFORE THE

01:30:43.404 --> 01:30:45.106
PANDEMIC. THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.607
BE REFORMED SO AS WE DISCUSSED

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:47.842
FINANCING REFORM WE HAVE THE

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.343
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES THAT

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.045
NOT ONLY AFFECT THE LIVES OF

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.213
WORKERS AND RESIDENTS BUT ALSO

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.015
HOLDS AND IF INDUSTRY-

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.683
ACCOUNTABLE FIRST SPENDING

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.652
TAXPAYER DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.853
INCLUDING MAKING TARGETED

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.154
INVESTMENTS TOWARD WORK FOR

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:03.624
STABILITY WHICH WILL IMPROVE

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:04.225
OVERALL QUALITY OF CARE. WE

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:05.693
BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.094
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD MAKE

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.129
SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:09.697
METHODOLOGY AND INVESTMENTS IN

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.566
ORDER TO STABILIZE THE WORKFORCE

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.034
AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF RESIDENT

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.769
CARE. THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.370
IS THAT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:17.905
DOES NOT FULLY REIMBURSED LABOR

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.340
COSTS OF NURSING AND SUPPORT

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.542
STAFF. NOR DOES IT ENCOURAGE

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:22.376
INVESTMENT TO IMPROVE WORK FOR

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:24.478
STABILITY. RATE INCREASES HAVE

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.113
BEEN GIVEN READILY TO FACILITIES

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.715
WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO RAISING

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.550
WAGES BENEFITS OR INVESTING IN

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:31.519
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE PROPOSE

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:32.687
A FEW SOLUTIONS THAT WILL

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.455
IMPROVE QUALITY THROUGH ENHANCED

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.157
DIRECT AND INDIRECT KERR LABOR

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:37.758
COST REIMBURSEMENT AND INCENTIVE

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:39.560
OPPORTUNITIES. CURRENTLY THE

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:40.995
SYSTEM REMEMBERS DIRECT AND

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:42.964
INDIRECT KERR LABOR UP TO THE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.865
NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.066
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:47.034
FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AND NON

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.237
LABOR COSTS LIKE SUPPLIES- AT

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.005
THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE.

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:53.007
THERE IS ALSO A COST CNTAINMENT

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:54.141
MECHANISM KNOWN AS THE GLOBAL

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.444
CAP. THAT REDUCES OFFICE YLIDES

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.945
PER DIEM RATES IF OVERALL

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.447
SPENDING PROJECTIONS IF THE

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:01.349
EXCEED THE STATUTORY. IS GIVEN

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:03.184
THE STATUTORY CAP. WE KNOW

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.485
OTHERS ARE PROPOSED MOVING THE

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.720
DIRECT AND INDIRECT KERR LABOR

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:08.256
PERCENTILE TO THE 100% TILE BUT

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:10.024
THIS WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.492
SINCE THE GLOBAL CAP IS IMPOSED

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.494
AFTER FACILITY SPECIFIC PER DIEM

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:15.730
RATES ARE CALCULATED. THE GLOBAL

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.131
CAP REDUCTION IMPOSES A GREATER

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:18.566
BURDEN ON FACILITIES THAT SERVE

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.001
A HIGHER POP PROPORTION OF

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:22.036
MEDICARE RESIDENTS. THIS IS WHY

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.437
WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXEMPT

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:25.373
DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARE COST

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:27.174
FROM THE GLOBAL CAPTAIN MAINTAIN

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.776
THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE CAP

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.678
ON LABOR COSTS. IT IS IMPORTANT

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:32.246
TO NOTE THAT MOST FACILITIES

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.614
THAT HAVE LABOR BECAUSE ABOVE

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.750
THE NINETY FIVE NINETY FIFTH

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.418
PERCENTILE SERVE LESS MEDICARE

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.152
RESIDENTS THAN THE STATE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:40.054
AVERAGE. THIS APPROACH WILL

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:41.622
PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.291
WORK FORCE BY ALLOWING MORE

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.792
FACILITIES TO BE AND REIMBURSE

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:47.862
FOR A LARGER PORTION OF THEIR

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:48.896
LABOR COSTS. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:49.764
THAT THE STATE ADDRESSES THE

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.098
RATE INCREASES THAT FACILITIES

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:52.166
HAVE RECEIVED DURING THE

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.968
PANDEMIC THROUGH AB EIGHTY ONE.

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.536
SMITH RECEIVED A 10% INCREASE

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:57.438
AND MEDICARE RATES TO ASSIST

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.507
WITH THE- ADDITIONAL COST DUE TO

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:01.342
THE PANDEMIC WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.311
EQUATED TO NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:03.978
AND THIRTY THREE MILLION

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:05.846
ADDITIONAL. FUNDS TO THESE

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:08.282
FACILITIES ALTHOUGH AB EIGHTY

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.016
ONE REQUIRED THE STATE TO

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.384
CONDUCT AUDITS NO AUDITS HAVE

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:12.119
BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC TO

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:12.920
DETERMINE IF THE FUNDS WERE

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.422
SPENT APPROPRIATELY. SINCE

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:15.323
WORKERS PAY DID NOT

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:17.058
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND CARE

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.659
GIVERS ARE LEAVING THE INDUSTRY

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.728
IN DROVES AT THE STATE AND IF

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.196
THE STATE INTENDS TO RETAIN THIS

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:24.031
10% INCREASE RATHER THAN LET IT

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.900
EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.068
DECLARED EMERGENCY PERIOD. IT IS

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.769
VITAL THAT ONE WE KNOW HOW THE

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.171
MONEY ALREADY GIVEN TO THE

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:32.239

PLACE BEFORE FURTHER INCREASES

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:37.144
ARE GIVEN. WE PROPOSE THAT THE

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.246
10% KOBE DELAYED A RELATED

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:41.182

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.626
APPROVED BY CMS. FACILITIES WILL

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:53.961
APPLY FOR THE RATE INCREASE TO

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:56.163
APPROVE BASE WAGES UP 210% OR

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.031
TWENTY DOLLARS HICHEVER IS

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.200
HIGHER. PROVIDE STAFF RETENTION

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:05.373

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:06.674
LEGALLY BINDING WRITTEN

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:08.275
AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.643
TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY ALONG

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.078
WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.613
TO RECOUP ANY FUNDS THAT ARE NOT

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.582
SPENT APPROPRIATELY. THIS TYPE

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:15.783
OF PROGRAMWOULD AVOID THE

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.485
PITFALLS OF WAGE PASS THROUGHS

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:18.919
WHICH DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.521
NURSING HOME WORKERS WAGES WILL

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.722
INCREASE BECAUSE THE CURRENT

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.624
SYSTEM LACKS THE MECHANISM TO

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:24.492
ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.027
APPROPRIATELY. WE SUPPORT THE

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:27.695
STATE'S GOAL TO YOU THE MORE

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:28.562
QUALITY BASED REIMBURSEMENT

SYSTEM. THE ACS HAS INDICATED

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.133
THEY PREFER AT LEAST 40% OF

FUTURE RATE INCREASES BEING TIED

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.770
TO QUALITY PERFORMANCE HOWEVER

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.138
WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:39.407
THIS PORTION OF THE FUTURE RATE

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.007
INCREASE IS DEDICATED TO THE

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:42.276
EXISTING COST BASED. METHODOLOGY

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.444

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:49.784
OUR GLOBAL CASH EXEMPTION- IS

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.318
NOT ADOPTED WILL RESULT IN

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.820
LARGER RATE REDUCTIONS FOR

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.822
FACILITIES THAT CARE FOR MOSTLY

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.857
MEDICARE RESIDENTS. FOR YEARS

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.225
NEVER HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:59.660
RATE INCREASES AND QUALITY

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:01.962
PAYMENTS WHILE NEGLECTING TO

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.397

FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WHICH

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:42.049

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.187
CAST MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THE

CURRENT MEDICARE RATES SYSTEM IS

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:49.890
WORTH OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.892
HOWEVER DUE TO THE LAST TWO

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.827

SHOWED SHORTAGES WE ALSO

01:43:59.232 --> 01:43:59.933
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.034
MEDICARE RATE NEEDS TO BE

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:02.836

LONG TERM CARE. NURSING

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:08.742
FACILITIES WERE ALREADY

01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:10.377
STRUGGLING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:12.512

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:28.762
FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:29.963
TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:31.298
CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION H.

HUNDRED C. N. A.'S LEFT THE

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:37.838
PROFESSION. SO THAT'S JUST FROM

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.172
TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.407
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:41.174
SINCE THEN WITHOUT NECESSARY

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:43.343
STAFF NURSING FACILITIES ARE

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:43.944
FORCED TO REDUCE THEIR CENSUS

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.946
WHICH IS THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:48.382
OVER TWENTY YEARS. AT 78% BENDS

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:52.552

PLACEMENT. SKILLED NURSING

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.088
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WE

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:57.290
KNOW- A 100% GOVERNMENT FUNDED

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:59.259
WITH ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR

USUALLY AROUND 20% CUT

ONLY PAID 53% OF THEIR COSTS BY

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:14.775
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ANOTHER

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:16.176
WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:17.678
UNDERFUNDING IS TO COMPARE RATES

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:19.012
LET'S SAY BETWEEN NURSING

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.681
FACILITY CARE AND IN HOME

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:22.783
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.084
MEDICARE REIMBURSES THE AVERAGE

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:25.886
NURSING FACILITY TWO HUNDRED

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:28.088
FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. AND THAT IS

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.156
SUPPOSED TO PRIDE RESIDENT WITH

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.991
ALL THE ATTENDANT SERVICES THEY

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.025
NEED AND THEY DESERVE.

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:35.128
CALIFORNIA PAYS AN AVERAGE I

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:36.830
DOLLARS A DAY AND WE WOULD SAY

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.365
THAT STILL ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:40.600
HSS WORKER. BUT THAT COVERS AN

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.735
EIGHT HOUR SHIFT IN SOMEONE'S

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:43.804
HOME IT DOESN'T COVER NURSING

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:47.040
CARE MEALS UTILITIES RENT FULL

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.042
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THAT A

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:51.945
NURSING HOME- PROVIDES. AT RIGHT

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.580
NOW AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:55.015
AND FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. THE

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:56.650
MEDICARE RATE IS TWICE THE

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:59.286
MEDICAL RATE AT THE LOW END AND

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:01.088
AT THE HIGH END WHICH INCLUDES

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:03.523
THERAPY SERVICES IT'S UPWARDS OF

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.459
EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:07.027

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:07.928
TO PROVIDING SERVICES TO

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.229
MEDICARE PATIENT BUT IT IS

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.964
GOVERNMENT FUNDS THAT ULTIMATELY

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.332
DICTATE WHAT RESOURCES CAN BE

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:13.834

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:19.740
KEY ITEMS WHICH WE FEEL MUST BE

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:21.174
ADDRESSED IN THE SNIFF MEDICARE

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:36.896
THIS IS. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.031
HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:39.165

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.183
KANEMI. PROPOSAL AND WOULD HOPE

01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:00.186
THAT WE COULD FIND ROOM TO

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.354
ENSURE THAT WORK FORCE FOR

FOR US TO- I AGREE WITH THE

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:11.364

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:13.700
IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE WE NOT

WE MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:17.603
SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE. AND THAT

01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:20.173

WE CAN SOLVE ANY ONE BUDGET YEAR

02:05:27.019 --> 02:05:29.321
YOU SAID IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE

02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:30.456
AND YET YOU ONLY INVITED US TO

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:34.793

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.229
ISSUE IS A COMPLEX ISSUE I'M I'M

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:40.599
KIND OF CONFUSED. IT IS

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:42.201
DEFINITELY A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:44.703
INVOLVES A LOT OF DISCUSSION BUT

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.672

02:10:10.969 --> 02:10:12.171
RESPOND TO THE PERTINENT

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:14.206
PANDEMIC EVERY. YOU KNOW TIME

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:15.974
THERE. IMPORT ISSUE OR THINGS

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.142
THAT CHANGED OR ANNOUNCEMENTS

02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:18.777
FROM C. PH I THINK IT WAS A IT

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.746
WAS A REALLY HARD TIME FOR IT

02:10:20.812 --> 02:10:22.681
FOR EVERYBODY. I'M IN SO I THINK

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:24.049
THE ASSOCIATION IN OF ITSELF

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.784
WANTS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:26.418
SUPPORTING ITS MEMBERS. TOWARDS

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:28.453
MOVING TOWARDS QUALITY- I THINK.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.955
MOST OF OUR FOLKS FEEL LIKE

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:31.757
EVERYDAY IS A STRUGGLE TO TRY TO

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:33.225
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:35.227
RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME-

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:35.861
AND MAKING SURE THAT GOT THE

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:37.863
RIGHT PEOPLE WORKING FORM SO.

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:38.997
HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION AS

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:41.500
WELL AS I COULD. APPRECIATE THAT

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.235
IN TERMS OF BY BY GUESS MY

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:45.237
QUESTION IS. SO IF WE ARE ABLE

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:47.105
TO INCREASE THE MEDICARE RATES

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:49.708
WILL WILL. DISSOCIATION BE DOING

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:52.277
ANY WAGE INCREASES ARE NOT

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:55.447
COMPLETE DEPEND ON MEDICARE. SO

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:57.950
IT IS MEDIC COW IS- A PRIMARY

02:10:58.016 --> 02:11:00.986
FUNDER- SO THERE ANY OTHER

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:02.154
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTS I MEAN AT

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.088
LEAST THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:05.190
REPRESENTS TWO THIRDS OF THAT

02:11:05.257 --> 02:11:07.993
SO- WE CAN'T WE WOULD SAY IT

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.695
CAN'T BE DONE WITHOUT IT. NOW

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:11.363
THERE WERE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:12.497
WERE PROVIDED DURING THE

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:13.966
PANDEMIC AND CONTINUE WITH THE

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:15.734
TEN PERCENT- RATE ADJUSTMENT

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:17.236
THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:18.971
AND FACILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:21.240
USE THOSE FUNDS BOTH FOR AND

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.542
WAGE INCREASES AND INFECTION

02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:26.778
CONTROL PP. MANY IF NOT MOST OF

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.247
OUR FACILITIES UTILIZE THOSE

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:30.249
ADDED FUNDS TO INCREASE WAGES

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.383
FOR PROVIDE BONUSES OR

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:33.218
RECRUITMENT RETENTION TYPES OF

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:35.254
PROGRAMS FOR THEIR- THIRD FOR

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.989
THEIR EMPLOYEES SO I CAN SAY IN

02:11:37.055 --> 02:11:37.990
MANY CASES NURSING FACILITIES

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.825
I'VE ALREADY RACED REACHES- TO

02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.727
TRY TO ADDRESS ON THE WORK FORCE

02:11:41.793 --> 02:11:43.695
SHORTAGES AND KEEP THEIR FOCUS-

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:45.998
A WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC-

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:48.867
SO. ON IF FIRST I WOULD SAY THAT

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.068
THAT FOR THE MEDIC HEALTH

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:51.069
PROGRAM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:53.572
DOES HAVE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:55.741
TWO THIRDS OF THE FUNDS. TO PAY

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.743
FOR INCREASES IN WAGES BECAUSE

02:11:57.809 --> 02:11:59.144
THEY REPRESENT TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.412
FUNDING FOR NURSING FACILITIES

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:01.780
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

02:12:01.847 --> 02:12:02.914
NURSING FACILITIES ARE GOING TO

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.816
KICK IN THE OTHER THIRD. AND SO

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:06.218
THEY'RE SAYING LOOK WE'LL

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:08.220
COMMIT. TO RAISING WAGES BUT WE

02:12:08.287 --> 02:12:10.822
NEED. OUR GOVERNMENTS OUR STATE

02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:12.124
MEDICAID PROGRAM BECAUSE WE ARE

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:13.759
A PARTNER WITH YOU WITH THAT

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:15.994
PROGRAM. AND TO HELP US DO THAT

02:12:16.061 --> 02:12:16.962
AND WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.664
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE WHIMS MY

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.065
QUESTION IS YOU YOU SORT OF MADE

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:22.267
IT YOUR OF ONE THIRD DEPENDED ON

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:24.002
OUR TWO THIRDS AND- IF R. TWO

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:25.203
THIRDS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHILE

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:26.405
YOU'RE STILL WHAT WERE YOUR

02:12:26.471 --> 02:12:27.806
ONCE. YOUR SECURE ONE THIRD

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.042
STILL COMMAND. AND AT AND I

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:32.377
WOULD ARGUE ARE ONE THIRD IS

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:34.179
ALREADY TRYING. IT'S ALREADY

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:36.148
THERE TO SOME EXTENT WITH THE

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:37.149
MONIES THAT WERE ALREADY

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:38.784
ALLOCATED THROUGH MEDICAL

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:41.119
PROGRAM AND ALSO. FACILITIES

02:12:41.186 --> 02:12:45.190
NEED AND WANT- TO HAVE QUALITY

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:46.058
CARE GIVERS IN THEIR BUILDING SO

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:47.626
THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:49.261
POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND

02:12:49.328 --> 02:12:51.029
SO I CAN SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:53.098
ALREADY DOING THAT PERSONALLY I

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:53.999
CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU FROM

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:55.467
FACILITY FACILITY. THE MITCHELL

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:56.968
SMITH WITH WASHINGTON BUT THINK

02:12:57.035 --> 02:12:58.670
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT THE ONE

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:01.406
THIRTY THIRD IN THE WE ARE THE

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:02.307
WHICH IS ALREADY THERE. THE

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:06.078
WAGES ARE NOT ALREADY THERE. MR

02:13:06.144 --> 02:13:07.312
NOT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.815
BE FOR SURE. THANK THIS IS YOUR

02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:11.683
NO THEY ARE NOT THERE WHICH IS

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:13.418
WHY WE WOULD LIKE THE 10% OF TO

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:14.786
BE REPURPOSE BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:16.822
NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUDITS I

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:18.790
THINK WE HEARD FROM DH CS AND

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.025
ONE OF OUR MEETINGS THAT THEY

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:21.727
PROMISED TO GET IT TO US AND-

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:22.928
THEY'RE- HOPING THAT THEY KEEP

02:13:22.994 --> 02:13:24.963
THAT PROMISE SO WE CAN SEE WHAT

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.064
HAPPENED TO THAT 10% BECAUSE

02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:27.432
AGAIN. IF THIS IS GOING TO

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:28.700
CONTINUE POST- THE PANDEMIC WHAT

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:31.536
HAPPENED TO THE FIRST CHUNK OF

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:32.204
MONEY AND THEN WHAT'S GOING TO

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.472
HAPPEN AS A CONTINUE SO I WOULD

02:13:33.538 --> 02:13:35.040
LIKE TO SAY IT'S NOT THERE

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:36.174
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN. SUCH A

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:38.076
THING GOING BACK TO MISS SNYDER

02:13:38.143 --> 02:13:40.078
SO YOU GOT. YOU GOT THE- THE

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:41.380
UNION SAYING THEIR WORKERS

02:13:41.446 --> 02:13:42.247
AREN'T SEEING IT SO WHERE

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:44.049
WORKERS WERE THE MONEY. I THANK

02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:46.251
THE I THINK WHAT MISS WHITTEN

02:13:46.318 --> 02:13:47.986
WAS SAYING IS IF THEY HAVE THEY

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.488
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE FACILITIES

02:13:49.554 --> 02:13:51.156
HAVE NOT BEEN AUDITED A NOW

02:13:51.223 --> 02:13:52.391
FACILITIES ARE TRACKING THAT

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:54.192
INFORMATION REQUIRED TO HAVE IT.

02:13:54.259 --> 02:13:56.661
SO I CAN SAY THAT IN MOST CASES

02:13:56.728 --> 02:13:58.163
POLICE THAT I TALKED TO I'VE

02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:00.065
SPOKEN TO THEY UTILIZE THAT

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:02.601
MONEY TO PAY MORE FOR WAGES AND

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:05.237
TO USE IT FOR BONUS PAYMENTS

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:06.838
RECRUITMENT RETENTION- IT LEAST

02:14:06.905 --> 02:14:08.106
IN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.541
WITH NURSING FACILITIES THAT'S

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:11.276
WHAT THEY USE THE MONEY FOR.

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:14.112
AGAIN MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS NOT.

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:15.647
BEEN PROVIDED THE INFORMATION SO

02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:17.716
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUSH A

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:18.650
SIMPLE BONUSES ARE VERY

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:22.354
DIFFERENT FROM WAGE INCREASES.

02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:25.357
TRIP SORRY TALKING ABOUT I

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:26.491
THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING YOUR

02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:28.326
YOUR YOUR DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:30.061
IS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:31.797
RIGHT OKAY SO THAT'S A WAGE

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:33.398
INCREASE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING

02:14:33.465 --> 02:14:34.733
YOU BY YOUR LAST STATEMENT IT

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:37.068
SAID IT WAS WORRIED THERE SO

02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:39.638
YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT

02:14:39.704 --> 02:14:40.839
THERE IN TERMS OF WAGES BECAUSE

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:43.175
WHAT YOU MENTIONED WERE- BONUSES

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.142
AND RETENTION BONUSES WHICH I

02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:46.711
THINK ARE ARE WONDERFUL BUT

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:47.879
THEY'RE NOT THAT'S NOT A WAGE

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:49.481
INCREASE. NO I APOLOGIZE IF I

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:50.916
SEEM TO IMPLY THAT. AT THAT THE

02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:53.218
WAGES WERE ALREADY AT TWENTY

02:14:53.285 --> 02:14:55.420
FIVE DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW OKAY.

02:14:55.487 --> 02:14:57.322
YOUR ONE THIRD OF THAT DRIVE TO

02:14:57.389 --> 02:14:58.223
TWENTY FIVE WAS A READER THAT'S

02:14:58.290 --> 02:14:59.858
KIND OF WHERE YOU HAVE. AN

02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:01.927
INTIMATE OKAY AND I APOLOGIZE

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:02.861
FOR THAT AS WELL ALL I CAN SAY

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:04.963
IS THE NURSING FACILITIES THAT I

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:07.299
HAVE SPOKEN WITH- THEY- HAVE

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:09.768
SAID THAT THERE THAT THE MONIES

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:11.736
THAT THEY HAVE. THEY'RE USING AS

02:15:11.803 --> 02:15:13.905
MUCH AS THEY CAN TO GO TOWARDS

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:17.609
INCREASED WAGES FOR- OF FOR IN

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:19.711
THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHAT CALF IS A

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:21.847
TESTING TO IS THE FACT THAT.

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:25.484
AGAIN IT IS A GOVERNMENT-

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:26.585
NURSING FACILITY PARTNERSHIP

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:29.287
THAT. REQUIRES THAT THE MEDICAL

02:15:29.354 --> 02:15:33.158
PROGRAM INVEST. THE DOLLARS. TO

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:34.526
MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.161
THERE TO RAISE THE WAES AND

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.329
UNTIL THE MEDICARE PROGRAM CAN

02:15:37.395 --> 02:15:38.897
AT LEAST PAY THE MAJORITY OF

02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:40.465
WHAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR.

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:43.668
NURSING FACILITIES WILL NOT HAVE

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.570
THE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO RAISES

02:15:45.637 --> 02:15:47.072
WAGES. OKAY SO SOUNDS LIKE THE

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:49.207
ANSWER'S. NO THAT EVEN IF WE

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:50.642
DON'T DO THE TWO THIRDS YOU

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.377
WON'T KICKING YOUR ONE FOR.

02:15:52.444 --> 02:15:54.880
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I GET TO

02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:56.948
TWENTY FIVE CORRECT. OKAY SO

02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:58.416
IT'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:15:58.483 --> 02:15:59.818
WHAT YOU JUST SAID A MINUTE AGO

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:04.155
OKAY GOT IT. ARMY SO FROM- THE

02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:06.892
ADVOCATES THERE'S A LIST OF.

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:08.593
ISSUES THAT THEY HIGHLIGHTED I

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:10.228
GUESS IT'S ON OF THESE OF THEIR

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:11.997
WARS ARE THE STAFF'S

02:16:12.063 --> 02:16:12.998
REINTERPRETATION OF A WORSE

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:15.133
BAND. SELF DEALING SCHEMES TO

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.902
PREVENT DIVERSION OF PUBLIC

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:19.304
FUNDS INTENDED FOR CARE AND

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:22.173
STAFFING- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.309
READ ANY OF THESE BULLETS ON OF

THOSE ANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT

YOU WOULD AGREE WITH OR- YOU

02:16:27.679 --> 02:16:29.748
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WORKING ON. AND

IF YOU THE METER READ READ

RECITE IT PUTS HERE YOU MIGHT

RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE- THE-

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:14.779
CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING

HOME REFORM SOME OF THEIR-

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:17.515
THINGS THEY TALK ABOUT HERE SO

02:19:17.582 --> 02:19:20.251
I. THINK SOME OF WHAT THEY- ARE

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:22.954
RAISING- WE HAVE BEEN PART OF

02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:24.089
DISCUSSIONS IN THE LAST COUPLE

02:19:24.155 --> 02:19:27.025
YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT- MUCH OF

02:19:27.092 --> 02:19:28.059
THIS CAN BE TRANSPARENT GONG

02:19:28.126 --> 02:19:30.128
FORWARD- AND I THINK IT'S

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.397
IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW AS I

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:34.132
MENTIONED EARLIER SB SIX FIFTY

02:19:34.199 --> 02:19:35.934
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT HAD A BILL

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.902
COUPLE THREE YEARS AGO. THAT

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:38.703
THAT MAKE SURE NURSING

02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:41.239
FACILITIES. ARE VERY TRANSPARENT

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:43.875
ABOUT. AS ALL OF THE RELATED

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:47.278
PARTIES- ALL OF THEIR AND- ANY

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:48.947
ANY OTHER TYPES OF RELATED

02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.815
PARTIES THAT THEY OWN AND WHAT

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:52.217
REVENUES GO TOWARDS THOSE

02:19:52.283 --> 02:19:55.620
PARTIES- SO I WOULD SAY FIRST

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:56.421
AND FOREMOST SOME OF WHAT THEY-

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:58.857
REYES HERE. WILL BE ADDRESS

02:19:58.923 --> 02:20:00.525
GOING FORWARD IN THE REPORTING

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:03.027
THAT IS REQUIRED AND AGAIN. WE

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:03.995
PARTICIPATED IN THOSE

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:05.764
CONVERSATIONS WE WERE SUPPORTIVE

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:09.033
OF THE TRANSPARENCY- AND- ENDED

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:10.068
UP GOING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:11.936
ON THAT BILL AS WE TALK THROUGH

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:15.440
IT WITH THE PROPONENTS INCLUDING

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:17.442
CANNER- I THINK- WHEN. IT'S ALSO

02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:19.144
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:22.914
MEDICARE PROGRAM DOES. CLEARLY

02:20:22.981 --> 02:20:25.917
AUDIT WHERE FUNDS MEDIC MEDICAID

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:29.154
FUNDS GO. AND DISALLOW ANY FUNDS

02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:31.723
THAT RE NOT APPROPRIATE ARE NOT

02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:33.892
AT MARKET VALUE OR IF THEY

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.460
DEEMED TO NOT BE A MEDIC CAL

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:37.428
DIRECT COST. SO THE MEDICARE

02:20:37.495 --> 02:20:39.564
PROGRAM HAS AN AUDITING PROGRAM

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:41.499
THAT FACILITIES MUST YOU KNOW.

02:20:41.566 --> 02:20:43.134
PROVIDE CLEAR DOCUMENTATION AND

02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:45.103
INFORMATION TO THE PROGRAM AND

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.805
THEY COME IN ANNUALLY TO ON IT.

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.106
SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:20:48.173 --> 02:20:49.874
PART TO IT BACK TO TRANSPARENCY

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:52.110
IN TRACKING THATINFORMATION. I

02:20:52.177 --> 02:20:54.512
ALSO SAID EARLIER THAT OFF IS

02:20:54.579 --> 02:20:57.916
OPEN TO OTHER FORMS OF LOOKING

02:20:57.982 --> 02:21:00.952
AT- TRANSPARENCY WHERE THERE CAN

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:03.054
AND SHOULD BE REASONABLE COSTS-

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.889
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:07.759
IN. EVERY AREA OF HEALTH CARE.

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:09.994
WE HAVE ENTITIES THAT OWN

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:11.996
DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT. AND THAT

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:14.365
DOESN'T MAKE NURSING FACILITIES-

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:15.667
YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT ANY

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.602
DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER HEALTH

02:21:17.669 --> 02:21:19.204
CARE PROVIDER- THEY MIGHT OWN-

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:20.805
YOU KNOW A POSSIBLY THE NURSING

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:22.373
FACILITY ITSELF BUT THEY ALSO

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.075
MIGHT OWN A LIP THERAPY COMPANY.

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:25.376
AND SO THE PAYMENTS THAT THEY

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:27.145
MAKE TO THAT THERAPY COMPANY.

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:28.780
SOMETIMES ACTUALLY DO SAVE

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:31.049
MONEY- AS OPPOSED TO COST MONEY

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:34.018
AND SO I THINK. TO CONSIDER-

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:36.321
NURSING FACILITY IS IT ANY

02:21:36.387 --> 02:21:37.222
DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. ENTITY

02:21:37.288 --> 02:21:38.723
FOR PURPOSES OF ONLY DIFFERENT

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:40.391
COMPANIES I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:41.726
MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THOSE

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:44.262
TRANSACTIONS ARE ARE TRANSPARENT

02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:48.233
AND WE'RE OPEN TO ANY. OTHER IS-

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:50.435
ANY OTHER IDEAS THE LEGISLATURE

02:21:50.501 --> 02:21:51.069
HAS SENT TO MAKE THAT MORE

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:53.104
CLEAR. WELL SEEMS LIKE FIRST YOU

02:21:53.171 --> 02:21:55.039
NEED A LITTLE MORE TRANSPARENCY

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.307
ON YOUR WAGES COULD YOU HAVE THE

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:57.075
PERSON REPRESENTING THE LABOR

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:58.843
FOR SAYING THAT THEY TURNOUT

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:01.279
SAYING THE WAGES- SO ARE YOU ARE

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:03.348
YOU SAYING IN TERMS OF- RENTS

02:22:03.414 --> 02:22:06.885
AND LEASE BACKS- INSURANCE

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:11.155
CHARGERS- AS WELL AS- INTEREST

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:14.192
RATES THAT THESE ARE ALL MARKET

02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:15.894
- THE THESE ALL STAND UP TO

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:18.162
MARKET BECAUSE THE- THE

02:22:18.229 --> 02:22:19.230
ADVOCATES ARE SAYING THEY'RE WAY

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:20.999
ABOVE MARKET. I CAN'T GET

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.867
PERSONALLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:25.403
ALL I DID SAY ONE WAS NOT OR NOT

02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:27.338
YOUR YOUR RIBS IN THE INDUSTRY I

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:29.774
UNDERSTAND THAT- WHAT I SAID WAS

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:31.609
THAT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM HAS A

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:34.145
CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY CALCULATE-

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:35.847
PAYMENTS TO NURSING FACILITIES

02:22:35.914 --> 02:22:37.548
FOR PURPOSES OF RENTS AND LEASES

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:40.051
AND IT'S- IT'S BASED ON A

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:41.019
PARTICULAR FORMULA IT'S NOT

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:43.021
BASED ON WHAT. THE FACILITY PAYS

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:47.625
IN RENT OR LEASES- I WOULD- I

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:48.927
WOULD SAY AND I'VE ACTUALLY HAD

02:22:48.993 --> 02:22:50.295
THIS CONVERSATION JUST RECENTLY

02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:51.529
WITH A CONSTANTLY WITH ASSEMBLY

02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:53.665
MEMBER WOULD STAFF ABOUT. A WEEK

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:55.500
WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S AN AREA

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.335
THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:22:57.402 --> 02:22:58.102
ATTENTION BECAUSE- IN MORE CASES

02:22:58.169 --> 02:23:01.039
THAN OFTEN- IT'S NOT THE NURSING

02:23:01.105 --> 02:23:03.207
FACILITY OPERATOR THAT OWNS THE-

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:05.476
THE- ACTUAL BUILDING ITSELF

02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:08.780
IT'S- OTHER FORMS OF. REITS OR

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:10.648
OTHER THINGS AND A LOT OF CASES

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:11.950
ARE FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:14.185
WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE AS WELL-

02:23:14.252 --> 02:23:15.987
IT'S OVER AT LEAST FROM MY

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:16.955
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S AN AREA

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:18.790
WHERE WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT-

02:23:18.856 --> 02:23:21.292
AND WE'RE OPEN TO IT TO TALKING

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:21.926
MORE ABOUT. WAYS THAT WE CAN

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:23.795
LOOK AT RECENT COSTS IN THAT

02:23:23.861 --> 02:23:25.897
REGARD. GREAT THANK YOU I'M I'M

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:28.566

ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM I HAVE A- A

02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:48.820
FEW RESPONSES I THINK IT'S

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:51.289
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:52.924
SYSTEM IS REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:55.159
WAS DEVISED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR

02:23:55.226 --> 02:23:56.961
WITHOUT ANY PARTICIPATION ANY

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:59.097
MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION FROM

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:01.866
RESIDENT ADVOCATES IT WAS SORT

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:04.869
OF A LAST MINUTE DEAL. WITH THEM

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:07.872
WE WERE EXCLUDED FROM AND WE

02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:11.376
SUBMIT THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:13.044
FOUR THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:15.179
DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO BUY GOOD

02:24:15.246 --> 02:24:18.349
CARE IN NURSING HOMES SINCE TWO

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:18.883
THOUSAND FOUR PAYMENTS TO

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.318
NURSING HOME FROM THE STATE HAVE

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:22.053
GONE UP OVER ONE HUNDRED

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.988
PERCENT. AND THE AMOUNT PAID IN

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:26.424
WAGES TO STAFF IS ABOUT 50%

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:29.160
INCREASE THERE'S A BIG DISPARITY

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:33.064
THERE- WE'VE BEEN RICH. OWNERS

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:35.500
THE- MULTIPLE IN THE STATE HAVE

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:36.734
BEEN ENRICHED- BUT THERE'S BEEN

02:24:36.801 --> 02:24:38.236
LONG LONG STANDING UNDER

02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:41.039
INVESTMENT. IN THE WORKFORCE SO

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:43.541
OUR OUR PROPOSAL WE HAVE A LOT

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:45.309
OF- RECOMMENDATIONS AND THANK

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:47.445
YOU FOR EXPLORING A LOT OF THEM

02:24:47.512 --> 02:24:48.579
THAT THEY'RE ALL STILL VERY

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:49.947
VIABLE BUT WHAT WE REALLY WOULD

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:51.816
LIKE. IS FOR ANY FUTURE

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:54.552
INCREASES CAN BE TIED DIRECTLY

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:56.120
TO STAFF TO INCREASING THE

02:24:56.187 --> 02:24:58.356
STAFFING MINIMUM SO THAT WE KNOW

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.024
THAT WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR IS AT

02:25:00.091 --> 02:25:01.426
LEAST SOMEWHAT RELATED. TO

02:25:01.492 --> 02:25:04.629
INCREASE STAFF- WE DO HAVE AGAIN

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:06.597
WE'RE ALL FOR INCREASING WAGES

02:25:06.664 --> 02:25:08.466
JUST TO FRONTLINE WORKERS

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:09.367
MEETING THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:12.437
IDEA- BUT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS

02:25:12.503 --> 02:25:16.140
ABOUT. SUBSIDIZING CNA'S IS THAT

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:17.942
THEY MIGHT END UP IF. THEY MIGHT

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:19.610
END UP REPLACING LPNS ARE

02:25:19.677 --> 02:25:22.113
REGISTERED NURSES. ARE ONES THAT

02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.681
C. N. A.'S I WILL PAYING THEM

02:25:23.748 --> 02:25:25.083
MORE WE GET THEM IN THE BUILDING

02:25:25.149 --> 02:25:26.818
BUT THEN THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP

02:25:26.884 --> 02:25:28.386
THE FACILITIES FROM THAN LAYING

02:25:28.453 --> 02:25:30.054
OFF OTHER DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE.

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:31.956
INSTEAD BECAUSE NOW THAT IT'S

02:25:32.023 --> 02:25:34.559
CHEAPER TO HIRE THIS UNITS SO-

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:36.828
LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS

02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:39.063
WOULD BE DONE BUT AGAIN. WE'RE

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.665
TOTALLY FOR INCREASING WAGES

02:25:40.731 --> 02:25:44.836

ABSOLUTE. WELL FRANKLY YOU I

02:25:46.404 --> 02:25:47.672
APPRECIATE THAT THE FEEDBACK ARE

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:49.207
WHAT WE QUESTION HAD IS THE TO

02:25:49.273 --> 02:25:51.342
BACK TO WHAT MR IT IS. YOU MET

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:53.010
MEDICARE'S A FORMULA IT'S ALL

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:54.312
THESE THINGS ARE REIMBURSED IS

02:25:54.378 --> 02:25:56.147
IT. IS IT IS THIS ONE OF THE

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:57.682
ISSUES THAT YOU ARRANGE FOR

02:25:57.748 --> 02:25:59.050
MEDIC CAL IS BEING TOO

02:25:59.117 --> 02:26:01.385
PERMISSIVE THAT THESE. YOU KNOW

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:03.454
THE RENTS THE LEAST BACKS THE-

02:26:03.521 --> 02:26:05.056
INSURANCE THE INTEREST RATES

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:09.293
THAT THIS REALLY. CAN US NOT

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:10.428
DOING OUR JOB TO TIGHTEN

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:11.562
MEDICARE. YEAH WE SUBMIT THAT

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:15.433
THERE'S- TONS OF INFLATED RATES

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:16.300
BEING PAID TO RELATED PARTY

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:19.003
ENTITIES. THERE ARE ON THE BOOKS

02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:20.404
MEDI CAL AUDITS AND JUST

02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:22.807
ALLOWANCES FOR CERTAIN. COSTS

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:24.242
ARE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THOUGH

02:26:24.308 --> 02:26:26.010
IS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY

02:26:26.077 --> 02:26:27.245
OPERATORS INFLATING THEIR RATES

02:26:27.311 --> 02:26:28.980
THAT RISE THE AVERAGE RATE UP

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:33.551
SO. YOU COST MIGHT NOT LOOK SO-

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:35.319
OUTLOOK SO MUCH LIKE AN OUT LIAR

02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:36.921
OF EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT.

02:26:36.988 --> 02:26:37.922
ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE JUST

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:39.423
ALLOWANCES IS THAT IT DOESN'T

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:41.192
REQUIRE THAT THE FACILITY REFUND

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:43.094
THE MONEY. IT JUST GETS BAKED

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:44.595
INTO THEIR FUTURE MEDICARE RIGHT

02:26:44.662 --> 02:26:45.897
MAYBE THE MEDICARE RATE GETS

02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:47.665
LOWERED IN THE FUTURE BUT THAT

02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:49.066
GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:26:49.133 --> 02:26:51.502
RAISE OTHER COSTS. IN RETURN SO

02:26:51.569 --> 02:26:53.304
IF YOUR COSTS ARE HIGH YOU CAN

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.872
JUST KEEP RAISING UNKNOWNS OSCAN

02:26:54.939 --> 02:26:57.308
THE QUESTION. BECAUSE EVERYONE'S

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:59.010
COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN NO ONE CAN

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:03.381
THAT. THAT'S THAT JUST COMES

02:27:03.447 --> 02:27:04.048
WITH THE MARKETERS. PRECISELY SO

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:08.252
OKAY. ARE KICKING WE GO MISS.

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:10.555
AARON TURNER NO SHE'S. WELL INTO

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:12.223
AND SEARCH IT JUST GOING BACK TO

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:16.194
MEDICARE ALL- HOW IS THIS YEAR

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.895
WHAT WHAT THE ADVOCATES ARE

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:18.996
RAISING THOSE ISSUES THIS IS

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:20.965
REALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE WOULD

02:27:21.032 --> 02:27:22.466
THAT SOUND IN OUR HANDS THAT WE

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:27.872
HAVE TO GO OVER FOR MEDICAL. SO

02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:30.007
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK

02:27:30.074 --> 02:27:31.976
REALLY STATE WE DO HAVE A IN ALL

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:33.611
HONESTY IT BUT IT JUST OR

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:34.712
LEMONADE ANY OF THE NON ELIGIBLE

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:37.148
OR EXCESSIVE COST- INCLUDING

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:39.217
THINGS LIKE PROFITS FROM RELATED

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:43.120
PARTY TRANSACTIONS- IN ADDITION

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:44.155
YOU KNOW. IF THERE ARE

02:27:44.222 --> 02:27:45.456
INDICATORS OF FRAUD THAT ARE

02:27:45.523 --> 02:27:47.091
IDENTIFIED DURING THE COURSE OF

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:48.593
ANY OF THE ANNUAL FACILITY

02:27:48.659 --> 02:27:51.429
AUDITS WE- WILL OPEN A FRAUD

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:51.896
INVESTIGATION AND OUR

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:54.332
INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALSO. OPEN

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:56.033
BASED ON COMPLAINTS RECEIVED

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.935
FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDING THE

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:05.243
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION OF FRAUD.

02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:07.812
AND WE WILL WORK FOR THE CASE.

WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:17.455
THE INDUSTRY. AND IF THE AID THE

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:17.989
ENTIRE IF EVERYONE IN THE

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:20.157
INDUSTRY IS INFLATING THE COST

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:22.026
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET. MONEY BACK

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:25.296
FROM MEDICAL- IS THAT SOMETHING

02:28:25.363 --> 02:28:27.164
THAT WERE REVIEWING BECAUSE

02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:29.967
THAT'S WHAT HE'S- ARTICULATE.

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:31.535
DOCTORS ARE LOOKING AT RELATED

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:34.438
PARTY- COST AND LOOKING TO

02:28:34.505 --> 02:28:36.140
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:40.444
ARE APPROPRIATE ME CAPTURED- WE-ARE ALSO LOOKING TO IDENTIFY ANY

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:42.513
OVERPAYMENTS THAT ARE RECOVERED

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.882
FROM THE FACILITY- THESE COULD

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:47.351
BE DUPLICATE PAYMENTS- PAYMENTS

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:49.086
AT WORK. WOULDN'T TALK TO

02:28:49.153 --> 02:28:51.389
BRUSSELS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:28:51.455 --> 02:28:52.657
AUDITORS ARE HOW HOW DID THE

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:54.292
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THE BASELINE

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:57.194
IS SO HIGH THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.663
THIS REALLY HIGH BASELINE AND

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.665
WE'RE GETTING KIND OF YOU KNOW

02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:04.068
WERE WERE FOR PAN- A LOT TO THE

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:06.504
OPERATORS WHO OWN THE INSURANCE

02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:12.610
COMPANIES THEY ON THE BUILDINGS. THEY ARE LENDERS. OR NOT PAINS

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:13.878
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT PAYING THE

02:29:13.944 --> 02:29:16.213
WORKERS THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED-

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.748
SO I GUESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:18.883
THE AUDITORS A LOOK AT THAT HOW

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.618
DID THEY DETERMINE WHAT THE

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:22.853
BASELINE READ WHAT THE BASELINE-

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:23.954
YOU KNOW INSURANCE PAYMENT

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:25.189
SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT THE BASELINE

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:26.290
INTEREST RATES SUPPOSED TO BE.

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:28.993
I'M A 10% INTEREST IT SOUNDS

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:34.498
PRETTY PRETTY HIGH. I AM J.

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.233
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DON'T HAVE

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:37.835
SPECIFIC DETAILS OF HOW THEY DO

02:29:37.902 --> 02:29:40.471
THAT CALCULATION- HOWEVER I DO

02:29:40.538 --> 02:29:42.006
KNOW THAT THEY THEY WORK AT

02:29:42.073 --> 02:29:43.941
EXTENSIVELY AMONGST THEMSELVES

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:44.875
STARTED TO WORK THROUGH AND

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:46.344
ENSURE THAT WHEN THERE ARE

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:47.978
RELATED PARTIES THAT THAT THEY

02:29:48.045 --> 02:29:50.381
ARE LOOKING- ARE BROADLY TO

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:53.317
DETERMINE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. WE

02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:54.018
GET AN ANSWER BY NEXT WEEK

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:56.487
REGARDING THE SPECIFICS TO THESE

02:29:56.554 --> 02:30:00.291
QUESTIONS I WILL TAKE THAT BACK

02:30:00.358 --> 02:30:06.097
YES- THEN- JUST GO GO GO INTO

02:30:06.163 --> 02:30:07.998
THE WORK FORCE I THINK THIS IS

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:10.835
YOU KNOW- I'M NOT A WORK FORCE

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:12.903
EXPERT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE

02:30:12.970 --> 02:30:13.771
ACTUALLY HAVE WORKFORCE EXPERTS

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.740
HERE SO I'LL TRY TO BE FAST AND

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:16.807
WHAT THE EXPERTS CRACKS OR

02:30:16.874 --> 02:30:18.642
QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT IS VERY

02:30:18.709 --> 02:30:23.547
CLEAR IS ON WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY

02:30:23.614 --> 02:30:24.682
THAT EMPLOYS PEOPLE WHO CAN'T.

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:27.051
LIVE ON THE JOBS. THAT THEY'RE

02:30:27.118 --> 02:30:29.220
WORKING. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:32.623
IS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE- THE

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.258
LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN THE WORK

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:37.161
FORCE TO PAY FORTY HOURS- WE SAW

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:38.162
WE HEARD DOING COVERT QUITE

02:30:38.229 --> 02:30:41.031
OFTEN. THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS

02:30:41.098 --> 02:30:42.032
WERE SPREADING COVERT BECAUSE

02:30:42.099 --> 02:30:44.001
NOT NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:45.236
HAVING A GOOD TIME IS BECAUSE

02:30:45.302 --> 02:30:46.737
THEY WERE GOING FROM ONE NURSING

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:49.340
HOME TO THE NEXT NURSING HOME TO

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:50.508
THE NEXT NURSING HOME BECAUSE

02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:52.076
THERE WERE TWO OR THREE JOBS. SO

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.744
I GUESS- YOU'RE GOING BACK TO

02:30:53.811 --> 02:30:55.146
AGAIN WHAT IS THE INDUSTRY DOING

02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:57.648
MISTER CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. HOW

02:30:57.715 --> 02:30:59.683
YOU'RE WORKING TO TRY TO. NOT

02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:01.252
HAVE NOT BE TOTALLY RELIED ON A

02:31:01.318 --> 02:31:03.587
PART TIME WORK FORCE PER FULL

INTO A SIX YEAR FOR AN EXTENSION

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:31.728

THERE WAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO

SHORTFALL I BASED UPON REAL IME

02:49:54.851 --> 02:49:57.086
AND PROJECTED CLAIMS DATA WE

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:58.254
WERE VERY PROACTIVE IN

02:49:58.321 --> 02:50:00.156
TRANSPARENT WITH BOTH PROVIDERS

02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:02.392

SERVICES RENDERED BUT WHAT IS IN

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:36.893

HOWEVER DUE TO THE SHORTFALL

02:50:49.038 --> 02:50:50.607
THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:50:50.673 --> 02:50:52.475

02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:12.155
OFTEN AVOIDING A COSTLY REPAIR

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:14.524

COVER THE COST OF PROVIDING THE

PROVIDE A CROWN. THE COST IS

02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:35.912
HIGH BECAUSE A CUSTOM CROWN MUST

02:52:35.978 --> 02:52:37.847

SUFFERING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:03.039
LOSSES. AND AS YOU KNOW A

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:04.273
BENEFIT WITHOUT A FUNCTIONAL

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.509
GREAT IS NOT A REAL BENEFIT AND

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:07.977
IT WILL LEAD TO INSUFFICIENT

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:10.546
ACCESS FOR BENEFICIARIES. CDA IS

02:53:10.613 --> 02:53:12.115
SEEKING AN INCREASE IN THE

02:53:12.181 --> 02:53:14.250
SCHEDULED MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE TO

SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS

02:53:15.651 --> 02:53:16.786

02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:20.890
ADDITIONAL. THIRTY MILLION TO DH

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:21.991
CS IS PROPOSAL. THIS IS A- TO

02:53:22.058 --> 02:53:23.726
MAKE THIS IMPORTANT COVERAGE

02:53:23.793 --> 02:53:24.794
EXPANSION MEANINGFUL FUNCTIONAL

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:27.363
AND MOST OF ALL A REAL BENEFIT.

02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:29.532
REGARDING DENTAL MANAGED CARE

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.367

BROADLY THE SPECIAL TERMS AND

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:35.304
CONDITIONS- BUT I DO WANT TO

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:36.272
POINT OUT THAT THESE

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:38.174
REQUIREMENTS OVERALL A LEAD ON

02:53:38.241 --> 02:53:39.675
THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

02:53:39.742 --> 02:53:41.677
SEEK TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION

02:53:41.744 --> 02:53:43.579
AND ACCESS GAP BETWEEN DENTAL

02:53:43.646 --> 02:53:44.747
MANAGED CARE AND THE FEE FOR

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:47.183
SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:49.285
LONG CONCERNED CDM. UTILIZATION

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:50.620
RATES OF DENTAL MANAGED CARE

02:53:50.686 --> 02:53:52.855
PLANS CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND FEE

02:53:52.922 --> 02:53:54.457
FOR SERVICE. ESPECIALLY FOR

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:56.159
PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN

02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:57.994
AND YOUTH. TO PUT THIS IN

02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:00.530
PERSPECTIVE THERE'S BEEN A 627%

02:54:00.596 --> 02:54:02.098
LOWER UTILIZATION RATE FOR

02:54:02.165 --> 02:54:04.100

FOR SERVICE. AND THIS

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:10.706
UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN THE CASE

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:12.842
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:14.110
BRING UP THE LOWER RATES OF

END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR DENTAL

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:24.187
MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD BE

SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED. BASED

02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:27.423
ON THIS DATA GIVEN THE VARIOUS

TIMELINES FOR THE SPECIAL TERMS

02:54:29.058 --> 02:54:30.760
AND CONDITIONS THIS WILL LIKELY

02:54:30.827 --> 02:54:32.662
LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND

02:54:32.728 --> 02:54:34.597
THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM.

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:36.499
THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WEREN'T

IN THE AGENDA CDA IS CONCERNED

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:04.827
WITH THE A FUNDING SHORTFALL

02:55:04.894 --> 02:55:07.063
AFFECTING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:14.036
INITIATIVE ALSO KNOWN. I ALSO

02:55:14.103 --> 02:55:15.605
KNOWN AS THE TI PROVIDED A

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:17.273
CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

CHILDREN'S PREVENTION SERVICES

02:55:19.442 --> 02:55:20.743
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT

02:55:20.810 --> 02:55:21.878
THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM

02:55:21.944 --> 02:55:23.746
IMPLEMENTED PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:26.449
INCENTIVES. THE SUCCESSFUL PARTS

02:55:26.515 --> 02:55:28.050
OF DTI HAVE TRANSITIONED TO

02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:31.354
CALLAHAM AND DTI WAS EXTENDED-

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:34.790
ANOTHER YEAR AS DEEDS DH CS HAS

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:36.259
MENTIONED. BUT AGAIN THE FUNDING

02:55:36.325 --> 02:55:37.226
SHORTFALL OF FORTY MILLION

02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:38.961
DOLLARS MEANS A DENTIST WHO HAVE

02:55:39.028 --> 02:55:42.331
PROVIDED SERVICES UNDER DTI

02:55:42.398 --> 02:55:42.999
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL NOT

02:55:43.065 --> 02:55:44.467
RECEIVE THE FULL PAYMENTS. IT'S

02:55:44.533 --> 02:55:47.136
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YES WHILE

THIS IS DTI INCENTIVE PAYMENTS.

02:55:49.238 --> 02:55:51.607
THERE ARE. THIS IS ACTUALLY

CREATED A NEW INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:55.044

02:55:55.111 --> 02:55:56.345
WITH ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE

02:55:56.412 --> 02:55:58.814
PAYMENTS THAT RANGE FROM A THIRD

02:55:58.881 --> 02:56:00.549
275% OF THE BASE RATE SO THESE

02:56:00.616 --> 02:56:02.952
ARE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

02:56:03.019 --> 02:56:04.954
PROVIDERS ARE RELYING ON. THIS A

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.322
ROADS THE TRUST BETWEEN

02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:07.790
PROVIDERS IN THE MEDICARE

02:56:07.857 --> 02:56:09.258
PROGRAM AND WE BELIEVE THE

02:56:09.325 --> 02:56:11.394
SHORTFALL SHOULD BE BACK FILLED.

02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.862
WE URGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND

02:56:12.929 --> 02:56:15.264
LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THIS GAP

02:56:15.331 --> 02:56:16.198

02:56:43.092 --> 02:56:44.694
BASED ON MY OF NEARLY THIRTY

02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:47.129
YEARS PRACTICING DENTISTRY- I

02:56:47.196 --> 02:56:49.865
DON'T SEE HOW THAT REALLY WORKS

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:52.401
IN THE REAL WORLD- I HAVEN'T

02:56:52.468 --> 02:56:54.337
PRACTICED IN A WHILE. BUT I WILL

02:56:54.403 --> 02:56:56.138

LAB WHICH I HAD- WERE IN

02:57:02.845 --> 02:57:05.214
OFTENTIMES A DEPENDING ON THE

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:06.582
PRICE OF METALS WHICH IS ALSO AN

02:57:06.649 --> 02:57:10.119
ISSUE- TWO HUNDRED. PLUS UP INTO

02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:11.120
MAYBE INTO A THREE HUNDRED

02:57:11.187 --> 02:57:13.389

PATIENTS SO- THAT DIDN'T COUNT

02:57:18.027 --> 02:57:20.496
THE CHAIR TIME. AND AND THEN MY

02:57:20.563 --> 02:57:23.699
RATE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT- YEAH

02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:27.069
YOU'RE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE

02:57:27.136 --> 02:57:29.572
WE'RE PROBABLY IN THE THIRTY.

02:57:29.638 --> 02:57:30.873
45230% REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND I

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:33.042
DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW HOW THE

02:57:33.109 --> 02:57:34.643
DENTIST MAKES IT. QUITE FRANKLY

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:36.379
BASED ON THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT

02:57:36.445 --> 02:57:37.947
THE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLAR

02:57:38.014 --> 02:57:39.715
HOW ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT ON THAT

02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:41.917
EITHER BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T

02:57:41.984 --> 02:57:43.386
KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER

02:57:43.452 --> 02:57:45.021
IS BUT THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:45.955
IT. IS IT DOESN'T DOESN'T WORK

02:57:46.022 --> 02:57:48.591
SO- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THE

02:57:48.657 --> 02:57:50.359
SECOND PIECE OF THAT I'M CURIOUS

02:57:50.426 --> 02:57:53.295
ABOUT- I KNOW IN OUR BUDGET

02:57:53.362 --> 02:57:56.465
ACTIVE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE

02:57:56.532 --> 02:57:59.535
CALLED FOR- THE PROCUREMENT OF-

02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:01.337
REAL. REGARDING THE DENTAL

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:04.473
MANAGED CARE ABOUT- CONTRACTS.

02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:06.675
AND THAT NEVER CALLING FOR BY BY

02:58:06.742 --> 02:58:08.711
DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND NOW

02:58:08.778 --> 02:58:10.613
WE'RE CALLING FOR AN EXTENSION

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:13.416
OF ANOTHER YEAR- CAN. WITH WHAT

02:58:13.482 --> 02:58:15.484
IS THE WHAT IS THE REASON FOR

02:58:15.551 --> 02:58:18.421
THE EXTENSION AND- BECAUSE WE

02:58:18.487 --> 02:58:20.156
CALL FORD IN THE BUDGET EVERY

02:58:20.222 --> 02:58:21.924
ALL THREE PARTIES AGREED THE

02:58:21.991 --> 02:58:23.726
ASSEMBLY THE SENATE GOVERNOR.

02:58:23.793 --> 02:58:28.731
WHY WHY. WHY ARE WE NOT WHITE

02:58:28.798 --> 02:58:33.102
WHY WE'VE EXTENDED A YEAR. SO

02:58:33.169 --> 02:58:35.738
BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR DISCUSSIONS

02:58:35.805 --> 02:58:37.239
REGARDING DENTAL MANAGED CARE

02:58:37.306 --> 02:58:39.075
AND BECAUSE DOWN ON MANAGED CARE

02:58:39.141 --> 02:58:41.310
IS A COMPONENT PART OF THE

02:58:41.377 --> 02:58:43.913
SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS I'M

02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:45.648
IN THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE NEED

02:58:45.714 --> 02:58:48.017
TO GO THROUGH A VERY PROCUREMENT

02:58:48.084 --> 02:58:49.785
BECAUSE THE EXISTING CONTRACTS

02:58:49.852 --> 02:58:51.487
TO DATE. HAVE EXPIRED SO THEY

02:58:51.554 --> 02:58:53.522
HAVE BEEN EXTENDED WE HAVE AN

02:58:53.589 --> 02:58:55.191
ABILITY TO EXTEND THEM THE

02:58:55.257 --> 02:58:57.993
EXTENSION IS ONLY IN PLACE SO

02:58:58.060 --> 02:58:59.228
THAT WE CAN THEN CONDUCT THE

02:58:59.295 --> 02:59:01.397
NEED OF PROCUREMENT TO THEN GO

02:59:01.464 --> 02:59:04.867
OUT TO IDENTIFY. HOPEFULLY I'M

02:59:04.934 --> 02:59:06.902
DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLANS

02:59:06.969 --> 02:59:08.737
THAT WOULD COME TO THE TABLE TO

02:59:08.804 --> 02:59:09.905
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

02:59:09.972 --> 02:59:13.175
PROGRAM BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:15.344
TIME. IN ORDER TO DO THE REPORTS

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:16.912
ARE MEANT FOR THOSE NEW

02:59:16.979 --> 02:59:19.048
CONTRACTS AND WE CANNOT DO THAT

02:59:19.115 --> 02:59:22.184
WITHOUT CONTRACTS JUST BE AN

02:59:22.251 --> 02:59:23.319
EXTENDED THROUGH THE END OF THIS

02:59:23.385 --> 02:59:25.921
YEAR- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE

02:59:25.988 --> 02:59:29.658
PROCURED. THE LAST REPORT CARE

02:59:29.725 --> 02:59:32.595
MEANT I WANT TO SAY IT WAS

02:59:32.661 --> 02:59:36.866
AROUND- NINE OH TEN I BELIEVE I

02:59:36.932 --> 02:59:38.834
DON'T HAVE THE EXACT THE ARMY

02:59:38.901 --> 02:59:40.469
BUT IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.805
THERE IS THAT A NORMAL INTERVAL.

02:59:42.872 --> 02:59:45.741
TWELVE YEARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE A

02:59:45.808 --> 02:59:48.110
LONG TIME. WELL THERE ARE THERE

02:59:48.177 --> 02:59:50.346
ARE CONTRACT EXTENSION YEARS ON

02:59:50.412 --> 02:59:52.548
THE CONTRACT EXTENSION IS

02:59:52.615 --> 02:59:54.450
DIFFERENT THAN A PROCUREMENT

02:59:54.517 --> 02:59:56.285
HEALTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WHAT

02:59:56.352 --> 02:59:58.854
IS THE TIP WHAT WHAT IN IN THE

02:59:58.921 --> 03:00:00.589
REAL IN THE WORLD OF THIS WHAT

03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:03.225
IS OF- WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT

03:00:03.292 --> 03:00:05.161
SHOULD WHAT SHOULD ENTITIES OUT

03:00:05.227 --> 03:00:06.395
THERE WHO MIGHT WANT TO

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:07.897
PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS

03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:12.468
RECENTLY EXPECT. FOR IT'S A TIME

03:00:12.535 --> 03:00:15.104
FRAME FOR REPORT RE PROCUREMENT

03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:17.206
. SO BECAUSE OF THE TIME THAT IT

03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:18.974
TAKES TO DO WAY PROCUREMENTS ME

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.976
TECHNICALLY WILL HAVE AT A BASE

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:23.512
NEAR OUT FIVE YEARS AND THEN

MIGHT THEN GO FOR- EIGHT YEARS.

03:00:31.487 --> 03:00:33.289
BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE

03:00:33.355 --> 03:00:35.591
TINY AND THEN THE OTHER

03:00:35.658 --> 03:00:37.393
INTERVENING FACTORS BY TYPICALLY

03:00:37.459 --> 03:00:38.661
CONTRACTS WOULD BE SOMEWHERE

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:41.263
BETWEEN SAY FIVE MAYBE SEVEN

03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:43.532
YEARS AND THEN WITH EXTENSION

03:00:43.599 --> 03:00:45.601

TYPICALLY WE SEE LIKE- FIVE IT'S

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:51.440

03:00:51.507 --> 03:00:53.375
ONE YEAR EXTENSION TIME. AFTER

03:00:53.442 --> 03:00:58.948
THAT NUMBER BUILT ON. OUR FORMAT

03:00:59.014 --> 03:01:00.716

WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT.

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:04.920
POTENTIALLY THE END OF TWENTY

03:01:04.987 --> 03:01:05.721

A NUMBER BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:20.736

03:01:20.803 --> 03:01:22.871
WE JUST CONTINUE TO EXTEND THE

GOING TO PUSH IT OUT AGAIN. THAT

03:01:43.759 --> 03:01:44.994
IS NOT OUR INTENT WE ARE

03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:47.563

WOULD HAVE TO USE THOSE LEVERS

03:07:58.867 --> 03:08:00.569
IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT.

03:12:25.834 --> 03:12:28.069
THIS WAY BURKE I'M WITH THE

03:12:28.136 --> 03:12:30.138
FEDERAL AUTHORITY IS WHY WE'RE

03:12:30.205 --> 03:12:31.740

PROGRAM AND NOW. FOR THE PART.

03:12:40.382 --> 03:12:42.517
AND IT GRANT PARK THAT PROGRAM

03:12:42.584 --> 03:12:43.885
AMOUNTS ARE BASED OF THE IN.

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:46.421

THAT WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND WE

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:35.864
HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPAND THOSE

03:14:35.930 --> 03:14:38.466

COST TO WRITE CARE IS HIGHER

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:28.583

LUCK. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT GONNA

03:15:43.832 --> 03:15:46.468
BE TRUST. PEOPLE ACTUALLY GONNA

03:15:46.534 --> 03:15:48.203
GET PAID FOR THE SERVICES THEY

03:15:48.269 --> 03:15:50.171
PROVIDE. SO I WOULD URGE THE

03:15:50.238 --> 03:15:51.573
ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER THE

03:15:51.639 --> 03:15:54.542

THAT PRIOR PERFORMANCE IS THE

03:16:17.132 --> 03:16:19.134
BEST PREDICTOR FOR FUTURE

03:16:19.200 --> 03:16:21.102
PERFORMANCE AND SINCE WE HEARD

03:16:21.169 --> 03:16:23.371
ABOUT HOW THESE MANAGED CARE

03:16:23.438 --> 03:16:25.640
PLANS HAVE HAD LOWER UTILIZATION

03:16:25.707 --> 03:16:27.575
RATES FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

03:16:27.642 --> 03:16:29.477
YEARS. IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION

03:16:29.544 --> 03:16:31.346
THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY

03:16:31.412 --> 03:16:33.648
WILL REACH PARITY OR IS THE

03:16:33.715 --> 03:16:35.950
EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL BE

03:16:36.017 --> 03:16:38.586

FOLLOW UP ON WHAT CDA HAD SAID

03:16:43.458 --> 03:16:45.093
FOR THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE

03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:46.027
CONTINUITY OF CARE TO COME UP

03:16:46.094 --> 03:16:48.563
WITH THE ROBUST TRANSITION PLAN

03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:51.833
HOPING TO- HAVE YOU PROVIDE SOME

03:16:51.900 --> 03:16:54.402
INITIAL COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU

LOOKING AT BETTER TERMS AND

03:16:58.006 --> 03:17:01.142
CONDITIONS- WE DO QUESTION. IF

03:17:01.209 --> 03:17:03.111
THE PLANS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET

03:17:03.178 --> 03:17:04.646
THOSE REQUIREMENTS COME THE END

03:17:04.712 --> 03:17:06.881
OF THE WEEK. SO TO THE EXTENT

03:17:06.948 --> 03:17:08.416
THAT THEY HAVE NOT MET THOSE

03:17:08.483 --> 03:17:10.418
REQUIREMENTS THEN WE WILL START

03:17:10.485 --> 03:17:13.188
TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR

03:17:13.254 --> 03:17:15.323
THE DESCENDANTS. AND TO THE

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:17.525
EXTENT BASED UPON WHAT THAT WAS

03:17:17.592 --> 03:17:19.127
JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK LIKE THEN

03:17:19.194 --> 03:17:21.296
ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD THEN WORK

03:17:21.362 --> 03:17:24.299
TOWARDS- AT AN APPROPRIATE

03:17:24.365 --> 03:17:27.335

RECALL PREVIOUSLY ONE WE HAVE

03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:31.406
BUT THIS PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE-

03:17:31.472 --> 03:17:34.142
OUR BUDGET CYCLES. THE TEAM HAVE

03:17:34.209 --> 03:17:37.312
WORKED ON. A TRANSITION PLAN AND

03:17:37.378 --> 03:17:39.280
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE THEN

03:17:39.347 --> 03:17:42.016
NEED TO EXECUTE ON THAT PLAN WE

03:17:42.083 --> 03:17:44.118
WOULD THEN LEVERAGE THAT AND

03:17:44.185 --> 03:17:45.553
WORK WITH YOU KNOW OUR

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:47.522
BENEFICIARIES ARE PROVIDERS

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:50.091
STAKEHOLDERS. AND TERMS OF THE

IN THE EXECUTION OF THAT

03:17:52.827 --> 03:17:54.596
TRANSITION PLAN BUT AGAIN WE

03:17:54.662 --> 03:17:56.564
HAVE TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND

03:17:56.631 --> 03:17:58.399
MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT. AND

03:17:58.466 --> 03:18:00.201
THEN START TO EXECUTE WITH THE

03:18:00.268 --> 03:18:02.136
NECESSARY STEPS BUT IT WOULD BE

03:18:02.203 --> 03:18:04.772
INFORMED BY A TRANSITION PLAN

03:18:04.839 --> 03:18:06.541
BASED UPON WHAT WE ARE SEEING

03:18:06.608 --> 03:18:12.380
HOW FAR. THAT PLAN AT THAT POINT

03:18:12.447 --> 03:18:13.848
IN TIME. I'M GONNA FALL UP ON-

03:18:13.915 --> 03:18:14.949
DA WOULD QUESTIONS ON THE DENTAL

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:17.051
TRENDS. INITIATIVE IF I CAN IT

03:18:17.118 --> 03:18:18.386
SEEMS THAT. PART OF YOUR

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:20.288
RESPONSE WAS THAT THE FEDERAL

03:18:20.355 --> 03:18:23.057
MATCHING FUNDS WOULD NOT BE

03:18:23.124 --> 03:18:25.793
AVAILABLE SINCE IT WAS NOT- PART

03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:28.129
OF THE CAPITAL. OUTLAY AT THE

03:18:28.196 --> 03:18:30.131
BEGINNING CAN YOU COMMENT ON

03:18:30.198 --> 03:18:31.566
WHAT WE BELIEVE THE STATE

03:18:31.633 --> 03:18:34.168
PORTION OF THAT SHORTFALL TO BE

03:18:34.235 --> 03:18:35.803
OUT OF THE FORTY MILLION THAT

03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:38.239
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS IT SIMPLY

03:18:38.306 --> 03:18:40.208
THAT WE CAN'T. PULL DOWN THE-

03:18:40.275 --> 03:18:41.976
FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS ARE IS

03:18:42.043 --> 03:18:44.712
THERE A STATE PORTION THAT WE

03:18:44.779 --> 03:18:46.881
SHOULD BE- AT A MINIMUM LOOKING

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:49.917
TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:18:49.984 --> 03:18:51.886
REIMBURSING PROVIDERS WITH. IT

03:18:51.953 --> 03:18:55.156
TOUGH FORTY MILLION IS THE TOTAL

03:18:55.223 --> 03:18:56.257
SOLAR WOULD BE WITHOUT THAT

03:18:56.324 --> 03:18:58.860
FEDERAL. SO THAT WOULD BE

03:18:58.926 --> 03:19:00.595
COVERING BOTH THE STATE AND WHAT

03:19:00.662 --> 03:19:01.829
WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN THE

03:19:01.896 --> 03:19:09.304
CATALYST. WITH THE FEDERAL

03:19:09.370 --> 03:19:11.606
PARTICIPATION HOW MUCH OF THAT

03:19:11.673 --> 03:19:12.907
FORTY MILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:19:12.974 --> 03:19:14.409
COVERED BY THE FEDERAL

03:19:14.475 --> 03:19:16.477
GOVERNMENT AYE YOUR- ANSWER

03:19:16.544 --> 03:19:17.879
RIGHT THERE WAS THAT THE STATE

03:19:17.945 --> 03:19:19.380
IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF

03:19:19.447 --> 03:19:22.517
THE FORTY MILLION- WHAT WAS IT.

03:19:22.583 --> 03:19:25.553
PRIOR TO THIS IS WHAT I WAS

03:19:25.620 --> 03:19:28.956
TRYING TO. OH I'M SORRY IT WOULD

03:19:29.023 --> 03:19:31.592
HAVE BEEN BASED UPON- SO FOR THE

03:19:31.659 --> 03:19:32.794
CHILDREN WE HAVE DIFFERENT

03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:34.729
FEDERAL MATCHING RATE. SO WOULD%

03:19:34.796 --> 03:19:36.564
BE ASED UPON THOSE THOSE

03:19:36.631 --> 03:19:38.566
FEDERAL MATCHING RATE SENT AS AN

03:19:38.633 --> 03:19:41.436
AVERAGE OF WITH LIKELY BEEN LIKE

03:19:41.502 --> 03:19:44.138
THAT. PROBABLY AT A SIXTY FORTY

03:19:44.205 --> 03:19:45.640
SPLIT BECAUSE WE GET A HIGHER

03:19:45.707 --> 03:19:47.375
MATCHING READ ON SOME OF OUR

03:19:47.442 --> 03:19:49.177
CHILDREN'S POPULATIONS I WITH

03:19:49.243 --> 03:19:51.112
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:53.281
WE HAVE TYPICALLY IT'S FIFTY

03:19:53.348 --> 03:19:58.186
FIFTY. AND THEN- IT THAT THE

03:19:58.252 --> 03:20:00.154
BALANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE UP

03:20:00.221 --> 03:20:05.626
BY THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS. IF MY

03:20:05.693 --> 03:20:07.862
MATH IS RIGHT THAT THEN IS THAT

03:20:07.929 --> 03:20:10.098
A MINIMUM SIXTEEN MILLION THAT

03:20:10.164 --> 03:20:12.200
THE STATE WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO

03:20:12.266 --> 03:20:14.969
CONTRIBUTE TO. ENSURE THAT THIS

03:20:15.036 --> 03:20:20.475
WAS HAPPENING- WHY WAS THERE NOT

03:20:20.541 --> 03:20:21.976
. AN ABILITY TO COME BACK TO THE

03:20:22.043 --> 03:20:23.478
LEGISLATURE WAS AT THE

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:26.314
APPLICATION PROCESS OR HOW COULD

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:29.717
WE HAVE SUPPORTED TO ENSURE THAT

03:20:29.784 --> 03:20:30.718
WE WERE CONTINUING THESE

03:20:30.785 --> 03:20:33.721
INCENTIVES. I THINK THAT THE

03:20:33.788 --> 03:20:35.723
CHALLENGES SO WE WERE OPERATING

03:20:35.790 --> 03:20:37.959
UNDER THE WEIGHT. SO UNDER THE

03:20:38.025 --> 03:20:41.295
WAIVER ITSELF IN TOTALITY THE

03:20:41.362 --> 03:20:43.865
WAIVER AND THE DTI PAYMENTS WERE

03:20:43.931 --> 03:20:47.268
CAPPED IN TOTALITY AT SEVEN

03:20:47.335 --> 03:20:48.302
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

03:20:48.369 --> 03:20:52.407
DOLLARS. SO WE GET ALL OVER THE

03:20:52.473 --> 03:20:54.742
FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND SO THAT IS

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:56.744
FUNDED IN PART AND I WANT TO

03:20:56.811 --> 03:20:59.147
CORRECT MY STATEMENT SO IN TERMS

03:20:59.213 --> 03:21:00.248
OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S

03:21:00.314 --> 03:21:02.617
FIFTY FIFTY. SO WE WOULD HAVE

03:21:02.683 --> 03:21:04.685
RECEIVED- FOR THAT THE STATE

03:21:04.752 --> 03:21:07.922
GENERAL FUND WHICH WE USE TO-

03:21:07.989 --> 03:21:10.525
OUR DISH THE FUNDING WHICH WAS

03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:13.194
FAR STATE DESIGNATED- HEALTH

03:21:13.261 --> 03:21:14.996
PROGRAMS THAT WE USE IN FACT.

03:21:15.062 --> 03:21:16.564
FINDING AND THE SAVINGS FROM

03:21:16.631 --> 03:21:18.466
THOSE STATE DESIGNATED HEALTH

03:21:18.533 --> 03:21:19.801
PROGRAMS WHERE WE COULD THEN

03:21:19.867 --> 03:21:22.136
CLAIM ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING

03:21:22.203 --> 03:21:25.440
TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE OF THAT

03:21:25.506 --> 03:21:26.541
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

03:21:26.607 --> 03:21:28.042
DOLLARS. SO FOR THE FIVE YEAR

03:21:28.109 --> 03:21:31.379
PERIOD THAT. WE WOULD GET YOU

03:21:31.446 --> 03:21:35.249
KNOW- THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:21:35.316 --> 03:21:36.918
FIVE MILLION STATE GENERAL FUND

03:21:36.984 --> 03:21:37.919
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

03:21:37.985 --> 03:21:41.722
MILLION. FOR THE ADDITIONAL YEAR

03:21:41.789 --> 03:21:44.325
. WE WERE ABLE TO THEN GET-

03:21:44.392 --> 03:21:46.194
ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND TO

03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:47.495
MAKE UP FOR THAT ADDITIONAL

03:21:47.562 --> 03:21:50.798
EXTENSION. SO AGAIN BECAUSE

03:21:50.865 --> 03:21:51.966
WE'RE OPERATING UNDER THE

03:21:52.033 --> 03:21:53.935
AUTHORITY OF THE WAIVER WE ARE

03:21:54.001 --> 03:21:57.004
THEN CAPPED AT THE ADDITIONAL

03:21:57.071 --> 03:21:58.473
SETTLED HERE THAT WOULD BE

03:21:58.539 --> 03:22:00.441
ALLOWED TO US AND SAID THAT WAS

03:22:00.508 --> 03:22:02.610
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

03:22:02.677 --> 03:22:04.345
FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND

03:22:04.412 --> 03:22:06.013
SELL HALF OF THAT WOULD BE BORNE

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:07.548
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HALF

03:22:07.615 --> 03:22:10.785
OF THAT WILL BE BORNE BY- THE

03:22:10.852 --> 03:22:12.787
STATE JOURNAL. SO LOOKING AT

03:22:12.854 --> 03:22:15.656
EXPENDITURES TO DATE. WHAT THE

03:22:15.723 --> 03:22:18.159
TEAM HAS REJECTED IS THAT WE

03:22:18.226 --> 03:22:19.760
WOULD BE- BURKE THOSE

03:22:19.827 --> 03:22:21.963
EXPENDITURES BY APPROXIMATELY

03:22:22.029 --> 03:22:24.732
FORTY MILLION. ISN'T TO SAY

03:22:24.799 --> 03:22:26.334
THOUGH THAT THOSE PROVIDERS NOW

03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:29.370
ARE UNDER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:22:29.437 --> 03:22:32.206
AS WELL. AND HOW HOW DO WE-

03:22:32.273 --> 03:22:35.610
INSURANCE THE THRUST GOING

03:22:35.676 --> 03:22:38.479
FORWARD IF FOR NOT FULLY

03:22:38.546 --> 03:22:40.381
REIMBURSING I'M SENSITIVE TO

03:22:40.448 --> 03:22:42.950
WHAT DOCTOR WHAT WAS SAYING IS I

03:22:43.017 --> 03:22:43.818
BELIEVE THE TRUST IS VERY

03:22:43.885 --> 03:22:46.187
IMPORTANT WITH PROVIDERS AND

03:22:46.254 --> 03:22:47.388
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SO

03:22:47.455 --> 03:22:50.358
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HOW WE COULD

03:22:50.424 --> 03:22:53.060
HAVE IMPROVED THIS- SO THAT THIS

03:22:53.127 --> 03:22:55.963
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. NO

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.665
UNDERSTOOD AND AGAIN I THINK

03:22:57.732 --> 03:22:59.100
THERE WOULD BE AN A WAIVER

03:22:59.166 --> 03:23:00.835
PROGRAM AND THERE BE AN AYE AYE

03:23:00.902 --> 03:23:03.070
CAPTAIN A LOT BUT IT WASN'T LIKE

03:23:03.137 --> 03:23:05.540
IT WAS AN OPEN ENDED. FUNDING

03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:07.275
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE ON OUR

03:23:07.341 --> 03:23:08.976
MEDICAID PROGRAM SO DO

03:23:09.043 --> 03:23:10.444
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT

03:23:10.511 --> 03:23:12.813
EVERYONE IS RACING BUT AGAIN WE

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:14.515
WERE OPERATING UNDER THE

03:23:14.582 --> 03:23:18.419
AUTHORITIES THAT WE HAVE FOR

03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:20.454
THAT DTI. AND SO WITH THAT

03:23:20.521 --> 03:23:22.890
ADDITIONAL YEAR. YOU KNOW THAT

03:23:22.957 --> 03:23:24.792
WAS A FUNDING MCAT AGAIN WE HAVE

03:23:24.859 --> 03:23:27.562
ALSO RECOGNIZE THE SUCCESS OF

03:23:27.628 --> 03:23:30.031
THE WAIVER PROGRAM AND-

03:23:30.097 --> 03:23:31.966
APPRECIATE GREATLY THE

03:23:32.033 --> 03:23:34.068
PARTICIPATION BY OUR PROVIDERS

03:23:34.135 --> 03:23:37.004
IN THAT PROGRAM. BUT AGAIN WERE

03:23:37.071 --> 03:23:39.273
ALSO FOUND BY THE SPECIAL TERMS
