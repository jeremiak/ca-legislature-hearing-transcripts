CALIFORNIA REALTORS AND TO ALL THE STAFF OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH TO REFLECT THIS PRODUCT TO THE DAY SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL BE THE FIRST BILL IN THE NATION TO. REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO REPORT HAHA NOT PAYMENTS FOR THOSE WHO OWNS- SUBSIDIZED RESIDENTIAL MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY- AND ITS OPTION TO REPORT THAT TO A MAJOR CREDIT BUREAU BY FOCUSING ON SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THIS BILL IS TAILORED TO THOSE TENANTS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FROM ESTABLISHING OR IMPROVING THEIR CREDIT SCORES. ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN ALSO INCLUDES DELAYED OPERATIVE DATE OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW TIME FOR LANDLORDS TO PASS COMPLY WITH THIS MEASURE SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A SIMPLE GOAL TO PROVIDE RUNNERS AWAY TO ESTABLISH OR PROVE THEIR CREDIT THE PAYMENT OF RENT- WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME. TENANTS WHO LIVE IN BUILDINGS FOR YEARS AND PAY THE RENT ON TIME BUT NEVER A YOU SHOULD GET THE BENEFIT OF THAT STABLE PAYMENT YET MANY TIMES WHEN YOU FAIL TO PAY YOUR RENT THAT IS QUICKLY REPORTED TO THE CREDIT BUREAU AND THAT. CAN BE A LASTING EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET OUT OF DEBT AND MOVE AHEAD AND EVEN ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP THERE'S NO REASON RUNNERS WHO READ WE PAY RENT. SHOULD RECEIVE A POSITIVE IMPACT OF A CREDIT SCORE BY DOING SO- TODAY UP TO WITNESSES WHO WILL TESTIFY IN SUPPORT SEARCH OF THEM. ALL WITH THE CREDIT BUILDERS ALLIANCE AND HOW THEY CAN ON THOSE KIANA SECTION TODAY WITH MISSION. ASSET FUND. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SO WE DO HAVE TWO PRIMARY SUPPORT WITNESSES SEARCH EVAN AND JOSE CAN UNITS ARE EITHER OF YOU ON THE PHONE. I AM THERE OKAY SIR. GREAT SERVICER THAN. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- CENTER BRADFORD MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN I AM IF YOUR CHARACTER AND THEN WITH A CREDIT BUILDERS ALLIANCE WE ARE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT THAT SEEKS TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS MOVE PEOPLE FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY THROUGH CREDIT BUILDING AND AS WE ALL KNOW A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY IS CRUCIAL IN TODAY'S ECONOMY AND WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS WE HOPEFULLY SOON- EMERGE FROM THE CURRENT PANDEMIC- CREDIT MARK. ALREADY TIGHTENING WITHOUT A PRIME CREDIT SCORE INDIVIDUAL TO PAY HIGHER INTEREST THEY PAY HIGHER FEES ON FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND THEY SPEND MORE ON ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE CAR INSURANCE AND CELL PHONES AND OFTEN HAVE. UNLIMITED RENTAL HOUSING OPTIONS. ADD TO IT IN IN AT. IT COMP FINANCIAL AND IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS MANY OF WHOM ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR TO GET AND STAY AHEAD. WONDER ALRIGHT MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOWER INCOMES AND LOWER WELL THEN THEY'RE HOMEOWNER COUNTERPART AND SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A MINIMAL CREDIT HISTORY THAT IS DEEMED AND SQUABBLE. FURTHERMORE MANY HAVE FEWER OPTIONS TO BUILD THEIR CREDIT HISTORY AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ARE UBIQUITOUSLY REPORTED TO THE CREDIT BUREAUS. BUT ON BALANCE HAVE YOU HEARD THE SENATOR SAYING ONLY DEROGATORY RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE REPORTED- FOR RENTERS. REPORTING IS A PROVEN STRATEGY TO GIVE RENTERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD CREDIT. TO BUILD CREDIT THAT HOMEOWNERS HAVE JUST BY MAKING THEIR MONTHLY HUSING PAYMENT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO MY ORGANIZATION CBA COMPLETED A PILOT THAT INCLUDED ONE THOUSAND LOW INCOME RENTERS. A INVISIBLE AT THE OUTSET ENDED UP WITH THE HIGH NON PRIME OF PRIME CREDIT SCORE AND 79% OF THOSE WITH LOWER COURT FATHER SCORES INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE POINT. AS A RESULT 15% MOVED INTO A LOWER RISK HERE WITH SOME EVEN GOING ON TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN HOME. THE FUEL BY THE FINDINGS AND SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS EPA HAVE SEEN TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN RENT REPORTING BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH IMPACT PLATE BASED SIMPLE AND SCALABLE SOLUTION. WITHOUT THE BEGUN TO SEE POLICY MAKERS IN STATES LIKE NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS AND DC PROMOTE WHAT REPORTING IS A VIABLE AND POWERFUL ECONOMIC MOBILITY STRATEGY. AND ONE THAT NARROWS THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IT'S PAST HOWEVER SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD BE AT THE SENATOR SAID. UP THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON RENT RECORDING ALTERNATELY BENEFITING POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA.

HI THIS IS RON KINGSTON I REPRESENT- PRIMARILY IN THIS CAPACITY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. ARE COLLECTIVELY THEY- HAVE FILE ALL DEED RESTRICTED HOUSING FOR VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THESE ARE THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE TARGETED AND- IF WHICH REGARD JSP ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN PROVISIONS ARE WE ARE FIRST OF ALL DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF WORKING WHERE ARE YOUR STAFF. AND NOTABLY MISTER BRADFORD STAFF- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS PRE CODED AND DURING COATED I WANT TO FOCUS ON- THE IMPACT OF THE US AND- DISCUSS WITH YOU WHAT. RING SIZE TO OUR REQUEST- A POTION WEST BILL AS AMENDED- FIRST OF ALL. BYE IT IS ALLEGED RAPE THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR CREDIT SCORES RACED SHOULD THEY OPT IN AND PAY TEN DOLLARS A MONTH- THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION WHETHER THAT WILL BE THE CASE BECAUSE THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS. OF OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS EARNING 50% OR LESS INCOME- VERSUS THE AREA WIDE MEDIA THAT WILL NEVER BENEFIT THIS BILL WON'T BE OFFERED TO THEM FOR THE TENANTS WON'T OPT IN SO THEIR CREDIT SCORE AS WE REFER TO IT. WILL HAVE A LOWER BECAUSE EITHER ALL SHIPS RISE FOR DOES THAT OFTEN AT THE END EVERYBODY WHO DOESN'T OFTEN WILL SUFFER THE RESULT AND- WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS EQUITABLE TO ALL THOSE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SECOND. WE QUESTION WHY- THIS IS. OFFERED BY TWO- THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HAVING THIS HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH HOUSING ARE THEY WILL NOT BE BUYING HOUSING WHEN YOU'RE ONLY EARNING 60% OF THE AREA WIDE MEDIAN FOR LAUGHS- THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS EARNING- TWENTY FIVE MAYBE TOTAL- THEY WILL NOT BY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. THIRD V. COST ACOSTA- HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AND BITE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT THE TENNIS WILL PAY TEN DOLLARS A MONTH IF THEY OPT OUT. WHICH THEY CAN DO IT ANYTIME. ARE WE ARE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE PAYING THE CREDIT BUREAU FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX- CONSECUTIVE MONTHS WHICH WE DO NOT LEAVE IS FAILED- NOR IF THEY OPT OUT AND STOP HEY ROBERT CATION WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO COLLECT ON THAT DEBT WE CAN'T DEDUCTED FROM A SECURITY DEPOSIT WE CAN WE WILL NEVER GO TO COURT OVER TO US AND THEREFORE IT REMAINS TO COST IT IS GOING TO BE A COST. SYSTEMATICALLY THROUGH ALL- ALL OUR RENTAL HOUSEHOLDS. IS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET UP A TRACKING SYSTEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO OFFER IT TO EVERYONE AND TRACK IT IF THEY- OPT IN THAN THEY OPT OUT THEN THEY OPTED IN THEY OPT OUT THIS KINGS EVERYBODY TO WRAP UP PLEASE YEAH. YES I'M GOING TO I'LL DO THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE GARDENS. BOB SO IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR. IS IF WE HAVE TO BEFORE OBLIGATED TO PAY FOR IT WE ARE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOVER ARE HARD COST BECAUSE THESE ARE HEAVILY DEED RESTRICTED PRICE RESTRICTED. PROPERTIES AND THAT THEIR RECENT A LOT. OF MONEY LEFT. AT ALL AT THE END OF THE GAME SO WE ASK THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED- FOR OUR RECOVERY ACTUAL RECOVERY OF COSTS. AND THAT IS CONCLUDES OUR TESTIMONY WAS MADE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN CHAMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM. SEEING NONE AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHOW YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AND WE'LL GO TO LINE THIRTY SEVEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CLEAN GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. C. A. R. IS MOVED INTO POSITION TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN AS AMENDED ON JULY TH.

WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET INSTRUCTIONS ONCE MORE. YES IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. WHO'S ON THE PHONE SPEAKING OPPOSITION OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN. PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP. RIGHT THANK YOU. AND I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- CENTER MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- REPORTING RANT IS SOMETHING THAT LANDLORDS ARE IN ABLE TO DO RIGHT NOW BUT JUST THAT MANY CHOOSE NOT TO DO IT AND THIS IS THE BILL THIS IS WHAT YOUR BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS IS THAT RIGHT YEAH. THAT'S HI. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THAT- THE BILL SAYS THAT A TENANT CAN FILE A WRITTEN NOTICE REQUESTING THE REPORTING OF THE RENT TO CREDIT BUREAU AND THE LANDLORD MUST COMPLY WITH THAT. YEAH ON THE THAT THE TENANT CAN SUBSEQUENTLY REQUEST. THAT THE LANDLORD STOP REPORTING AND THE LANDLORD MUST COMPLY WITH THAT SO MY QUESTION IS. IT COULD JUST BE USED AS A TOOL TO PREVENT A LANDLORDS FROM REPORTING A NEGATIVE- PAYMENT HISTORY ON A TENANT SO ANOTHER WORDS IF THAT HAVE TENDED JUST REQUESTED REPORTING AND THEN THE NEXT MONTH REQUESTED TO STOP REPORTING WITH THE LANDLORDS AND BE BARRED FROM EVER REPORTING. DELINQUENCIES AROUND FOR THAT TENANTS NOW THEY MANY WERE LANDLORDS ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THIS BILL SOLD THIS WOULD PROHIBIT THEM AT ALL THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOSE TO DO IT. OKAY BUT THE BILL SAYS SOMETHING OVERALL REGION THAT THE SECTION A TENANT WHO ELECTS TO HAVE REPORTED. MAY SUBSEQUENTLY FILE A WRITTEN REQUEST WITH THEIR LANDLORD TO STOP THAT REPORTING WITH WHICH THE LANDLORD SHALL COMPLY. SO MY QUESTION ISTHE BILL SAYS THE LANDLORD HAS TO STOP REPORTING. IS THAT RIGHT OR IS THAT NOT YOUR INTENTION THAT I MEAN. WE WANT THEM TO STOP IF IN FACT A TENANT WHO WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE REPORTING OR LANDLORD WASN'T INVOLVED IN THE REPORTING PRIOR TO THIS BILL. OPTION TO THIS AND THEN THEY SAID I WANT ALONG WITH NO LONGER BE A PART OF IT NO BUT THERE ARE SOME LANDLORDS WERE ALREADY REPORTING NEGATIVE PAYMENTS THE CREDIT BUREAU SO THEY WILL CONTINUE ON THEY WOULD STILL HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO SO BUT- THEY JUST STARTED BECAUSE OF THIS BILL AND THEN ATTENDING ARE ASKED TO. BE REMOVED FROM THEIR PROCESS YES THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF IT OKAY I'M STILL CONFUSED OR CENTERS THEY HAVE ATTENDED IS REPORTING CURRENTLY. I'M. SORRY LANDLORDS LANDLORDS REPORTING CURRENTLY. YOUR BILL PASSES ATTENDED REQUESTS REPORTING AND THAT SUBSEQUENTLY REQUESTS THEY'RE REPORTING BE STOPPED. CAN THE LANDLORD REPORT NEGATIVE PAYMENT HISTORY ON THAT TEN AND AFTER THE REQUEST TO STOP RECORDING. IF YOU WAS DOING THAT PRIOR TO THIS BILL BEING ENACTED YES THEY COULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS EXTRAPOLATION FOR THIS BILL. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE FOR A NEW TENANT TO ENERGY AND GOING FOR THAT THEIR- PAYMENTS REPORT. OKAY I'M SORRY. I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL AND PRINT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. AND SO I'D ENCOURAGE YOU IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD HERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PALATABLE ASSESSORS DEFICIENCY. ALSO IF I CAN ASK. THE BILL SAYS THAT THE FEE THAT CAN BE COLLECTED FROM A TENANT IF THAT FEE IS NOT PAID THAT DELINQUENCY CANNOT BE REPORTED TO A CREDIT AGENCY I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WAS ON THAT. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE IT SAYS THAT- ATTENDANT. CAN OPT OUT OF PAYING THAT FEE BUT- I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE WHERE THAT WOULD BE I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT TEN DOLLARS I MEAN WHY WOULD WE REPORT TIME ANYWAY I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT A TEN DOLLAR PAYMENT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY SO IT'S KIND OF A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT I THINK IF WE'RE TELLING. OUR% CREDITORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPORT A NEGATIVE PAYMENT HISTORY ON A ON A BORROWER- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF I WOULD CREDIT AGENCIES DO I CAN HEAR SOME OF THE BEST OF MY THE ROOT OF MY DISCOMFORT WITH THIS BILL. IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S DELIBERATELY WORDED SO THAT ONLY POSITIVE PAYMENT HISTORY CAN BE REPORTED. AND I THINK THAT THAT COMPLETELY MOVES THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE BUILD A CREDIT HISTORY. AND CREDIT BUREAUS KNOW THAT. ONLY POSITIVE. PAYMENT HISTORY CAN BE REPORTED THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING TO COMPLETELY DISCOUNT THAT PAYMENT HISTORY. WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETING A CREDIT SCORE ANYWAY. BECAUSE I MEAN AND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPERTS THEY'RE NOT STUPID THEY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO BILL MOVES FORWARD TO FIX THOSE DEFICIENCIES BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT- THAT INCLUDES THE WHOLE POINT AFTER. YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE WITH THIS BILL. BUT THANK YOU THIS RACE. ON I WANT TO THANK YOU THIS IS VERY CREATIVE I THINK WHEN WE HAVE TENANTS WHO HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING IN PAYING THE RENT ON TIME NEVER GET ANY CREDIT I WAS LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION- AND EVERY REASON GIVEN WAS THE REASON WHY THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE ENACTED IS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD SO MUCH BUT WHEN THEY FINALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEY HAVE THE WORST CREDIT SCORE BECAUSE ALL THAT'S BEEN REPORTED OR THE NEGATIVE THINGS WE KNOW THAT AND LANDLORDS DON'T ALWAYS REPORT THE NEGATIVE. BUT SOME OF THEM DO AND THEY WILL NEVER REPORT THE POSITIVE IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO ALSO REPORT THE POSITIVE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY. I MISSED REFERENCE ONE TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THE ARGUMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT- AND THIS WILL ACTUALLY END UP HURTING- FOLKS WHO DON'T DECIDE TO OPT IN. NO I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT AT ALL AND I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT IF YOU WERE. LIVING IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING TODAY YOU'LL FOREVER LIVE IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AS THERE'S NO BENEFIT. OF GETTING YOUR DIRECT. REPORTED AN ALMOST STATING THAT YOU'RE DSTINED TO BE POOR THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WHO LIVED IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND TO DATE NO LONGER LIVE THERE SO THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD TO ESTABLISH CREDIT. AND TO BUILD THE AMERICAN DREAM OF. HOMEOWNERSHIP OR ACQUIRING PROPERTY SO THIS IS IMPORTANT MEASURES CHAU. SO I IF I AM I MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTANDING AGAIN BUT I THOUGHT WHAT HE SAID AND- I DIDN'T ITEMS TO CONSENT TO CORRECTIVE I'M WRONG IS THAT- IF YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO OFTEN- AND OTHERS WHO DON'T THAT EVEN IF THEY HAVE A GOOD. RECORD AND- THEIR FAILURE OFTEN WATCHING HER TIME IN RELATION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT. STOP IT'S ALL SOLD HOW COULD SOMEONE USES NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING BE ARMED BY VOLUNTARY. PROGRAM IT'S OPTION. THE OPPORTUNITY CHOOSES TOP ARE OUT BUT BILLS EACH NOT TO. THEY'RE JUST AS THEY START AFTER NOT GETTING OF THE PROJECT AND THAT WE ARE. FAMOUS REPORT BUT THEY JUST WON'T BENEFIT FROM THE POSITIVE PAYMENT. HISTORY THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

TEN OPERATOR IF YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TEN. IF YOU WANT OPEN OUR LINES ARE OPEN THAT BILL OKAY- GOOD AND CENTER CABALLERO. YEAH IS JOINING. SENATOR PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TEN AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ENSURE RENTER FAMILIES AND LANDLORDS RIGHT CALIFORNIA REMAIN WHOLE DURING THESE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TIMES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION OF BOTH THE JUDICIARY AND THE REVENUE AND TAX COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS ISSUE PROVIDED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THE FEEDBACK AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT. THERE ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE AS WE LOOK AT- THE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS AREA AND TRYING TO WORK THROUGH- SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. IN THE ANALYSIS- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT DETAIL THAT'S INVOLVED AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS IT WAS- ORGANIZED BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A CHECKLIST I THINK FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC IS HEADED AN UNPRECEDENTED EFFECT ON CALIFORNIANS. SINCE THE ONSET. OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER BY THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED HISTORIC. JOB LOSSES. CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED IN JUNE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PEAKED AT SIXTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT. WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PEAK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT. AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PENDANT DEMOCRATS WERE SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE FILED UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS. ALL RECENT NUMBERS HAVE SHOWN A MODEST IMPROVEMENT THERE'S NO TRUE END IN SIGHT. AND THE ECONOMIC TOLL HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS. ALL THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. MANY OF THESE BENEFITS HAVE RUN OUT AND ACTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS LACKING. THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE STRUGGLE FOR MANY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN JANUARY AND ANALYSIS BY BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOWED OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIANS PAID 30% OR MORE OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON HOUSING COSTS. MEANING MORE THAN HALF OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE ALREADY BURDENED BY THE HIGH COST OF RENT IN IN MY DISTRICT. THAT NUMBER IS CLOSER TO SIXTY THREE PERCENT. AS A RESULT MANY RENTERS HAVE STRUGGLED TO PAY THE RENT. SINCE THE ONSET OF THE CUPBOARD. NINETEEN VIRUS. IN ARIL 24% OF RENTERS WERE UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT ON TIME. WHICH IS INCREASED TO THIRTY PERCENT. IN JUNE ACCORDING TO A RECENT NATIONWIDE STUDY. THE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. ARE UNABLE TO PAY RENT. AND THERE ARE AT RISK OF EVICTION. SO THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING. WITHOUT STATE INTERVENTION THE NUMBER OF RENTERS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS BORING HI. OR CONTINUE TO GROW ITS FULL ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IS LIKELY STILL A LONG WAY OFF. SB FOUR FOURTEEN TEN PUT FOUR KEY PROVISIONS IN PLACE. IT CREATES COVERED. NINETEEN EVICTION RELIEF AGREEMENTS. SIR REST IN TO DEMAND FOR AND- OR OBJECTION ACCRUED. UNPAID RENT- EVICTION ACCRUE DURING THIS OF EMERGENCY AND SPECIFIED TIME THEREAFTER PROVIDE TO PERSONAL. INCOME OR CORPORATE TAX CREDIT EQUAL TO THE OF RENT FOR GIVEN LAN OR ARE PER OR OWNERS IT'S A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WHICH CAN BE SOLD FOR IMMEDIATE CASH RELIEF FOR USED BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND REQUIRES TENANTS TO REPAY THE RENT TO THE STATE IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS INTEREST FREE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND NOT TO EXCEED TEN YEARS. FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES FURTHER AID TO RENTERS BY ALLOWING QUALIFYING PARTICIPANTS THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO FORGIVE SOME OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED RENT BASED ON INCOME LEVEL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED THAT IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME MANY OF THOSE DESPERATELY IN NEED. FOR HAVE THE LEGAL STATUS TO ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENTS UNDER THIS BILL LET ME BE CLEAR THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM EVICTION AND PROTECTION SHOULD NOT BE BASED SOLELY ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU FILE A TAX RETURN. I COMMIT TO YOU HERE TODAY THIS REMAINS A TOP ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THE BY THE TIME THIS BILL IS IN FINAL FORM WHETHER IT'S THIS BILL OR ANOTHER BILL THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR BRAD BIRD TO MAKE SOME CRITICAL COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR. NUMBER THANK MICHAEL. CENTER COP. FROM OVER HER WORK AND WORLD. THE STAFF FOR HELPING US GET TO POINT. AS STATED AS FORTY TENNIS CLARISSA. TO THE DESK. TO MANY TO ALLOW ORDER FOR. TO COLD BUT NOW. NEARLY ONE MILLION LEARNERS HOW TO RETURN ARENA HOW. HAVE X. JOB LOSS BY OF COLD AT NIGHT. THAT'S APPROXIMATE ONE INCH ALL ROUNDERS. BUT THIS PROBLEM EXISTED WILL BE. COLD WITH NINE MANY LONG. CALL WERE ALREADY WRITTEN BURDEN AND CLASS ONLY MAY IT WORK. YET AGAIN WE SEE THIS BILL. PAIN AND ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MAKE UP ALMOST EIGHTY PER. AROUND OUR HOUSE WHO HAVE YOUR- THIS OUR REGION THROUGH THE WORKING ECONOMIC LOOKING GROUP THE SENATE WHICH ARE SENATOR HURTS PULLED. HELLO. AND WE KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY FEEL THE SAME. THERE ARE A FEW FUNDAMENTAL- FUNDAMENTALS THAT GUIDE US ON THIS BILL TENANTS WHO CANNOT PAY THE RENT DUE TO CALL THE NINETEEN SHOULD NOT BE EVICTED FOR ONLY FOR ONLY THAT REASON LANDLORDS STRUGGLING BECAUSE- THEY'RE TENANTS ARE STRUGGLING SHOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO FORECLOSURE ONLY FOR THAT REASON. AND THE GENERAL FUND MUST BE PROTECTED BECAUSE OF THE OTHER CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT- WE MUST SUPPORT AND IF WE PUT. THE FULL FORCE OF THE CRISIS ON LENDERS CREDIT WILL BECOME MORE SCARCE AND WHICH WILL UNFAIRLY HURT BILLS AGAIN WITH BAD CREDIT SCORES AND MOST AGAIN PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE EVERYONE TEN IT'S A LOT MORE TO LIKE- WE HAVE TO COMPROMISE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS WORKABLE I'M GONNA BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT A HANDOUT. TO RUNNERS ORLANDO. IT'S A HAND. HAND UP TO HELPFUL SURVIVE DURING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE I MEAN CRITICAL TIME MANY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT. WE'RE PROTECTING THE LEARNERS KNOW WE WANT TO PROTECT BILL SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO. IF THEIR TENANTS WERE NOT KEEN THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IF EIGHT LANDLORDS NOT MAKING HIS MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. EVERYONE LOSES THAT THE TENANT GETS EVICTED THAT PROPERTY GETS FORECLOSED ON SO THESE TAX CREDITS ARE SMALL WAY TO HELP. KEEP EVERYBODY HOUSE KEEPS TENANTS FROM BEING EVICTED DURING THIS EMERGENCY EXCEPT FORGET HEALTH AND SAFETY REASON ALLOW THEM TO FOR. MUCH OF THE MISPRINT AS NEEDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS INTEREST FREE A STATE GRANT STRUGGLING LANDLORD TO TAX CREDIT CAN BE USED OR SOLD IF NEEDED. THE FIRST PAYMENTS TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND A GORGEOUS WHAT. HOMEOWNERS MORTGAGE PROTECTIONS WITHOUT SQUEEZING NOT CREDIT AVAILABILITY THIS BILL IS A STRONG PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT SEEKS TO BALANCE BETWEEN. TENANTS AND LANDLORDS THE BALANCE BETWEEN KEEPING PEOPLE HALLS NOW IN DIFFERENT MOST OF THE COST. ARE TO A LATER DATE. AND AGAIN WE HAVE WORKED. HARD ON THIS PROPOSAL AND- I WASTE FOR JUST A THE GUY THINK ABOUT HOW TO REACH TO THIS CRISIS AND THIS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE THE CENTRAL. CONVERSATION PIECES TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNED RECOGNIZES BILL STILL WORK IN PROGRESS. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ISSUES AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS FINAL CONVERSATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS DANIEL SOLVING ALL- WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. THANK YOU I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES SUPPORTLISTED DANIEL CITY YOU KNOW. WHO IS HERE IN PERSON AND DEBRA CARLTON. ON THE TELEPHONE SO WE WILL START WITH MISTER CITY YOU KNOW HERE IN THE CHAMBERS OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRED MEMBERS DANIEL SABINO SUBSTATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. OBVIOUSLY WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY CONCEPT THIS BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF RENTERS. WHO ARE AT ECONOMIC RISK THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. WITH THE FINANCIAL REALITIES FACED BY LANDLORDS WHO DO HAVE BILLS TO PAY. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN- WELL SPOKEN TO BY BOTH THE AUTHOR AND HER CO AUTHOR. BUT ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HUMAN LEVEL. WE HAVE A PANDEMIC FACING OUR STATE AND OUR NATION AND STATE TODAY EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING. OUR SYSTEM THERE ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- THE SERVICES ARE COORDINATED BY REMEMBER REGIONAL CENTERS. THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DEVELOP ABILITIES CAN LIVE AS INTEGRATED A LIFE AS POSSIBLE. BUT OF HOUSING IS FOR HOUSING IN THE FAMILY HOME. IS ONE OF. CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER STRIVE TO SUPPORT. OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THEM THOUGH IN THE FACE OF AN EVICTION IS EXTRAORDINARILY LIMITED. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK RELIEF THROUGH THEIR LANDLORDS THROUGH THESE SAARA AGREEMENTS. AND WOULD THEN ALLOW THE LANDLORD SOME FINANCIAL PROTECTION TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN STILL MAKE THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. THIS IS A GROUP HOUSING STABILITY. STABILITY OF HOUSING IS OF COURSE CRITICAL TO ANY PERSON BUT THIS IS DOUBLY ND TRIPLY SO CASE FOR A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THEIR ABILITIES TO REMAIN INTEGRATED IN THEIR COMMUNITY HAD TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES IS FOUNDED ON THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE SAFE AND SECURE HOUSING.

WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TEN IS THE ONLY BILL THAT ATTEMPTS TO DO BOTH. IF WE DON'T FIND A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SOONER FOR THE SMALL OWNERS THEY WILL LOSE THEIR HOUSING AND ULTIMATELY THE TENANTS WILL LOSE THEIR HOMES.

MODERATOR CLOSE THE LINES FOR SB FOURTEEN TEN AND WILL BRING IT BACK P TO THE COMMITTEE AND CENTERS- I WOULD APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. ON THIS SO FAR AND I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF WORK LEFT TO BE DONE AND I THINK WE- THREE STAFF IN IN TALKING TO HAS EXPRESSED SOME OF THAT. I WORRY THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HERE FOR THE SMALLEST OF THE LANDLORDS. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SETTING UP SOMETHING THAT WE SEEN ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST RESOURCES ARE GETTING THE MOST OF. THE RELIEF MONEY THAT THAT CANNOT BE THE MODEL. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SHE TAKEN SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS OF THAT WE PUT IN TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL TENANT PROTECTIONS BUT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BILL THAT REALLY IS THE SAME SUBJECT AND THAT'S MESSAGES BILL THAT'S IN THE SENATE THAT THAT. NEEDS TO BE. BROUGHT NECESSARILY TO THIS BILL BUT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. LANDLORDS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN FOR FROM LOSING THEIR- THEIR HOUSING I. I KNOW IN FROM YOUR STATEMENTS THAT THE SHARED SOME OF THOSE BUT THIS IS A- NEED TO BE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH IT IS A VERY COMPLEX APPROACH AND- I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD I'M GLAD THE GOVERNOR'S ENGAGED IN THIS. YOU MAY. NOT BE BUT HAD TO TRY AND BRING. THE BROUGHT THE POLICIES TOGETHER AND ENSURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A PACKAGE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE OVERALL CAN BE PROUD OF THIS THAT THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL LIKE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE TO CONVERSE. WE TRYING TO. SO MISCONDUCTS. SENATOR I WANT TO PREFACE THIS WITH- I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS IS NOT- MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ARE NOT YOUR INTENT WITH THE BILL- AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE THINGS I'M A SE- ARE A COMMON CONCERN WITH OUR LATINO CAUCUS AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS SO. I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT. SUPPORT AND F. THAT HAS OR SEEKS TO HELP A SMALL PORTION OF TENANTS THAT DON'T INCLUDE THOSE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION I JUST I CANNOT AND WILL NOT DO THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WON'T VOTE FOR TODAY TO MOVE ON BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S A BIG CONCERN BUT WE ARE SEEN SYSTEMATICALLY AS YOU KNOW- A SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY- E ACTUALLY CALLED- ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE BEING LEFT OUT OF EVERY RELIEF PACKAGE THAT COMES THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHOSE FAMILIES ARE BEING JEOPARDIZED- BY IT BY THEIR EFFORTS IN OUR OWN- SOME OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS OF COURSE MANY WHOSE. KIDS ARE GOING TO BE U. S. CITIZENS. ANY PAY TAXES IN DIFFERENT FORMS- I'M OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME TWEAKS THAT I TEN FILERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO. OPERATE UNDER THIS BUT- I THINK IT'S A HARD LINE THAT MANY OF US HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE WITHIN THE CAUCUS AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BANGING THE DRUM FOR SO LONG AND IT SEEMS LIKE. THESE PROPOSALS STILL- NEGLECT THE DEEP AND DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT THAT IT'S HAVING ON MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING- THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND MIXED STATUS HOUSEHOLDS- SO THAT'S A STATEMENT BUT AGAIN YOU YOU ADDRESSED IT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU ADDRESS YOUR COMMENTS THAT THAT WAS NOT YOUR YOUR PURPOSE. I AM EQUALLY CONCERNED- THAT IT WILL LEAVE OUT THE POOREST OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO DON'T FILE TAXES. AND SO I SPENT A LONG TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THIS WORKS- THAT THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN MY LIKE HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET THIS UP AND RUNNING AND ACTUALLY UTILIZE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF IT. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT HOW WE ADDRESS THESE POPULATIONS WHO- DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. I ALSO WANT TO WARN AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE IN MY MIND TO FORCE- TENANTS TO INFORM THEIR LANDLORDS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED- I HAPPEN TO. HAVE LIVED THROUGH AN ERA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- WHERE THERE WAS EFFORTS TO. PENALIZE AT FIRST FOR LANDLORDS TO. PARTICIPATE IN IN THE EFFORTS TO INFORM- AGENTS OF PEOPLE'S DOCUMENTATION STATUS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. OF INDIVIDUALS- I FEAR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS WILL LEAVE THEIR RESIDENTS TO BECOME- WITH THAT HOMELESS. RATHER THAN SHARE THAT IN. WITH THEIR FAMILY SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD- I THINK IT MOVES IF IT MOVES TODAY IT WOULD MOVE TO MIGHT COMMITTEE- BUT I KNOW YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ALL. CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE AND SO. I'M GLAD YOU'RE THE AUTHOR- BUT I'M I'M VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BILL. AND ANY RELIEF IT SEEKS TO. IT SEEKS TO HELP I DON'T THINK IT'S BROAD ENOUGH I THINK RENTAL RELIEF AND KEEPING PEOPLE THEIR HOUSES CAN AND SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW IN IN THIS LEGISLATURE- IT IS THE ONE THING WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED IN AND THEN FED THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I THINK AS WE MOVE INTO. A TIME OF ECONOMIC CRISIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE OUT SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS- IF I PREFER NOT TO EVEN VOTE FOR THIS IN THIS FORM I WON'T BE THE REASON THAT THAT'LL DIES- SO IF I NEED TO VOTE FOR TO MOVE IT ON I WILL BUT- I KNOW YOU TAKE THESE ISSUES SERIOUSLY AND I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON OVER THE NEXT. WEEK TO GET INTO A POSITION WHERE WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE. RIGHT IN FRONT OF. OKAY. THIS OBERNOLTE THAT IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SENATOR- IS YOU KNOW I'M VICE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY BUDGET AND I SAID- JAIL B. C. AS WELL SO I TEND TO SEE POLICY THROUGH BUDGETARY LANDS YEAH AND MY FIRST THOUGHTS WHEN I READ YOUR BILL WAS- INTERESTING IDEA I WONDER WHAT THAT WILL COST AND HOW WILL PAY FOR IT. SO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WOULD COST IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ATTENDANCE IN THE STATE WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT- BECAUSE THEIR TAX CREDIT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE TAX SITUATION OF THE LANDLORDS IS AND HOW MUCH FOR BROWN REVENUE THE STATE WITH THAT EXPERIENCE. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY- TEST LANDLORDS WOULD REQUEST REFUNDABLE- REFUNDS OF THE TAX CREDIT AND WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR HAT SINCE THAT'S A SEPARATE PORTION OF THE BILL SO- YOU KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE BUT CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE COST OF THIS WOULD BE AT LEAST TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIALLY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THAT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I WOULD AGREE AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND- HIS GETS TO THE ISSUE THAT WAS THAT WAS JUST. RAISED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS THAT- THERE. ORIGINALLY THIS BILL BASICALLY SAYS THE STATE IS GOING TO PONY UP THE MONEY. THAT THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS WAS TO SAY WE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION GOT TO DO IT NOW. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW AND WE LOOK DOWN THE ROAD WEHOPE THAT THE ECONOMY STARTS TO PICK UP. AND SO THE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE BEEN. BATTING AROUND IN TERMS OR TO A BAR DISCUSSION OF HOW. HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHO REALLY NEEDS. THE RELIEF. AND IF YOU'RE RENTING. A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH. CONDO DO YOU EED THE RELIEF BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY HAVE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU MAY NOT BE MAKING IT TODAY BUT YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF ASSETS AND RESOURCES. BUT MAYBE THAT SEVEN MAYBE SO THE NUMBER THE NUMBERS BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND I. I EXPECT I'M- I'M AN OPTIMIST BUT I. IN TERMS OF WHEN I LOOK AT NUMBERS. I AM VERY A REALIST AND I DON'T THINK YOUR NUMBER IS VERY FAR OFF IT PUT COULD POTENTIALLY COST IS THAT DOWN THE ROAD. AND A LOT OF THINGS. IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG WE LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN THE DATE IS BLANK RIGHT NW. BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE THE BEST. MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN WE THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO GO BACK TO WORK. ON OR THE ECONOMY TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT. AND HELP WHETHER WE SET UP A MEANS TEST. AND WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING BECAUSE THE NUMBERS. THE NUMBERS ARE FLUCTUATING IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A DOWNWARD TREND AND IT'S GOING TO AND IT'LL BE IT WILL BE AT UPSIDE DOWN IT WON'T BE A YOU IN OTHER WORDS. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN FITS AND STARTS AND SO OUR NUMBERS ARE ARE- I THINK THE HIGHEST NUMBER I'VE SEEN IS TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS I'M HOPING IT'S LESS THAN THAT BUT WE GOT TO BE PREPARED FOR IT BEING SENT TO SUBSTANTIAL. OKAY YEAH IT'S- I KNOW I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT. BUT OBVIOUSLY TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IS THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING VERY MUCH DOWN TO. AT LEAST FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND NEXT FISCAL YEAR OUR BUDGET IS YOU KNOW BALANCED IF YOU CAN CALL A BALANCED. THROUGH USING THE TOOLS OF SPENDING DEFERRALS AND BORROWING SO IT'S NOT AS IF AND WHEN RESERVES. YES USE ME FOR INTERRUPTING CERTAINLY AARON RESERVES BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT AS WE HOPEFULLY EMERGE FROM THIS RECESSION WHICH YOU KNOW PROBABLY FROM AN EMPLOYMENT STANDPOINT IS NOT GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY THE YEAR AFTER THAT. WELL WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE SEVERAL YEARS OF VERY DIFFICULT BUDGETARY SITUATIONS IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE DEFERRALS IN THE BORROWING THAT WE'RE USING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET NOW AND MEET THIS NEED SO- I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK. TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO USE STATE FUNDING TO PAY LEAVE- THE STATE'S PORTION OF THE- THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN AS YOU KNOW A BIG DEBATE IN CONGRESS OUT OF STONE THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I MADE AN OFFER THIS LAST WEEKEND- THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER OF- THREE TO ONE MATCH FOR STATE FUNDING SO OUR AT THE STATE PUTS HIM HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK AND FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE IN THREE HUNDRED. AND GOVERNU SOME SAID FLAT OUT THE STATE ABSOLUTELY CAN'T AFFORD THAT BUT INTERESTINGLY THE COST OF THAT IS ACTUALLY FAR LESS THAN THE COST OF WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING TO DO. SO I THINK IT'S YOU BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR US TO TALK ABOUT THE MERITS. OF THIS POLICY. WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME TALK ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE OF AN ISSUE NO WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF OUR OWN WITH THAT MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. MY GRANDMOTHER BEFORE SHE PASSED USED TO TELL ME THAT IF WISHES WERE FISHES WE DAHLE CASTANETS. AND SO YOU KNOW IT FORTUNATELY WISHES ARE FISHES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PASS A POLICY LIKE THIS WITH A SUBSTANTIAL COST I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO TALK. AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT WHERE THAT MONEY COMES FROM THAT'S MY BIG CONCERN. WITH THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING THAT DISCUSSION. INSTEAD. THANK YOU THIS ISSUE GREAT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AB LET ME FIRST START BY JUST REALLY THINKING THE SENATE AUTHORS AND- THE CENTERS FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND- AND IF I COULD BE CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC WE HAVE AS AS THOSE OF US WERE AUTHORED BILLS IN THE SPACE. VERY VERY LITTLE TIME TO ADDRESS THIS THIS CRISIS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAD INITIALLY BEEN LOOKING AT A DEADLINE OF THIS FRIDAY TO LIFT THEIR STATEWIDE TEMPERATURE MORATORIUM- THAT IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE MOVED TO SEPTEMBER FIRST BUT AT BEST WE HAVE. TWO AND A HALF WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVERT A MASSIVE WAVE OF EVICTIONS WHICH WOULD BE INCREDIBLY CATASTROPHIC FOR TENANTS HOMELESSNESS AND COVERED SPREAD- OF THE MAGNITUDE I THINK IT'S HARD FOR ANY OF US TO COMPREHEND SO I JUST WANNA FIRST THANKED THE AUTHORS OF SB FOURTEEN TEN FOR ALL THE WORK AND CREATIVE THINKING. INTO THIS BILL THIS IS HARD THIS IS REALLY HARD AND- I THINK ONE IMPORTANT ELEMENT FROM YOUR BILL THAT I APPRECIATE IS THE IDEA THAT IF THE FEDS ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO THE RESCUE OF AMERICANS THAT THE STATE OUGHT TO PUT MONEY INTO THIS CRISIS I SUPPORT THAT PREMISE ALL I WILL SAY THAT IF I HAD TO STRUCTURE PROVIDING TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE PROBLEM I WOULD PROBABLY SUGGEST. I WOULD I WOULD PROPOSE DOING IT THROUGH DIRECT RENTAL SUBSIDIES RATHER THAN THROUGH TAX BREAKS TO THE LANDLORD INDUSTRY APPRECIATE PROKSCH IN AS OUR- CHAIRMAN ALLUDED TO- HI OF AUTHORED AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX AND ONE FREESHIP WE HAVE TO TWENTY CO AUTHORS IN THE BILL INCLUDING FOR US THIS CAN. WHO THEN ARE PROPOSES AN UPPER. AGAINST INFECTIONS AND MORTGAGE FOR BARRY PROTECTION. FOR PROPERTY OWNER AND LANDLORDS ARE FOR CLOSE. AND NOT PERSONALLY. STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS. THESE IDEAS NEED TO BE PART OF AN OVERALL SOLUTION- I WANT TO JUST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR AN INCREDIBLY IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. I'VE BEEN ON THIS BILL FROM ITS INCEPTION AND- JUST TO SUMMARIZE A FEW THE CHALLENGES THAT BUT I THINK WE HAVE SEEN- WE HEARD FROM OUR- BUDGET VICE CHAIR THE PRICE TAG. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS AND COUNTING- AND THE FACT THAT- IT IT MAY NOT IT MEET THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS. YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS- YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR PREPARATIONS CHAIR ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES PARTICULARLY ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND STRUGGLING UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY- REYES IN THE ANALYSIS WERE THE CHALLENGES AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD PREVENTIVE ACTIONS. CONDUCTED BY OTHER MEANS- THE POSSIBILITIES OF A FRAUD INVOLVING THIS NEW TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND THEN. MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE TAX AUTHORITIES WILL TREAT THESE CREDITS AND WHAT THE- FUTURE TAX COURT MARKET WOULD LOOK LIKE. WE COULD PROBABLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT WHAT I'D LOVE TO DO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED SOME CONVERSATIONS IS JUST UNDERSTAND YOUR RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY FOR ME. AND WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM THE TECH COMMUNITY ALL OVER THE STATE. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS IT PUTS THE LANDLORD IN THE DRIVER SEAT AND THERE ARE STILL. TOO MANY VOLUNTARY ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT DON'T PROVIDE TENANTS. THE PROTECTIONS THAT THAT I BELIEVE THEY NEED- I'VE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LANDLORD INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY- THE LARGER LANDLORDS- PLAYERS BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS. HOMEOWNERS AND SMALLER PROPERTY OWNERS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED. IF THIS WERE THE ONLY BILL IN THE WORKS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AS THE SOLE SOLUTION TO BUILDING CRISIS AND WE HAVE. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE APPROACH OF THIS BILL COULD BE AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- CENTER I HAVE SPOKEN AND BOTH OF US- HAVE HAD ALONG WITH OUR COLLISIONS ON GOING CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADERSHIP AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND IF IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- TO GET CENTER AND I THINK IT IS OUR RESPECTIVE HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS THAT. THIS BILL AND A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND HOPEFULLY SHORTLY THERE WILL BE A LARGER AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR TWO HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MY PROFOUND HOPE IS THAT THESE BILLS WLL REFLECT A BALANCED. COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TO PREVENT COVER TENET PROTECT EVICTIONS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STRUGGLING PROPERTY OWNERS AND LANDLORS SO- WITH THAT I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT TODAY- OBVIOUSLY YOU YOU AND I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BUT- LOOKING FOR THOSE LATE NIGHTS AND WE HAVE TO GET THIS DONE SO. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU- SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS- TRYING TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE SOLUTION- TO AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- BUT I THINK THE DISSOLUTION THERE'S SOME BIG PROBLEMS- NUMBER ONE I YOU KNOW THE EVICTION SUSPENSION IS VERY BROAD AN INDEFINITE AT THIS POINT LIKE AT LEAST WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE HAVE A CLEAR TIMELINE FOR WHEN THIS EVICTION SUSPENSION IS GOING TO BE IN PLACE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THIS BILL IT'S IT HASN'T BEEN DEFINED- WE ALSO IS VERY BROAD I MEAN WHAT ABOUT TENANTS WHO MAYBE YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE. A NEIGHBORING TENANT IS A NUISANCE WE'RE NEED TO WEAR A OR A LANDLORD WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S IN A SUBSTANTIAL BREACH OF THE LEAST FOR SOME OTHER REASON OTHER THAN RENT I MEAN IT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM FOR THE COMPLEX AS A WHOLE. THERE WOULD BE NO NO WAY TO GO FOR WITH AN ELECTION YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S NOT ADDRESS IN HERE SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. ALSO WE GO TO AND WE HEARD IT VERY CLEARLY SMALL MOM AND POPS. LANDLORDS HOW IN THE WORLD IS OF A TAX CREDIT FOR YEARS FROM NOW. GOING TO HELP THEM PAY THEIR MORTGAGE TODAY. ANOTHER THING I THINK IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN IS A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH TENNIS RIGHT NOW. AND ARE WORKING THROUGH THIS BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO A BIG SOMEONE NO WANT TO BE PUT IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION ANOTHER THE TENANT OR THE LANDLORD- AND SO THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH PEOPLE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE MORTGAGES. THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY TODAY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S NOT GOING TO WAIT INDEFINITELY- BEFORE FOR CLOSING AND THAT'S THE BANKS AND SOME OF ALL ENTIRELY AGREED TO DO DEFERMENTS. BUT THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOR DO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD POLICY. TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT YOU'RE PUTTING THE SMALL MOM AND POPS. IN A VERY BAD PLACE SO. I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME REALLY BIG HOLES. IN THE SOLUTION BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS I THINK THIS IS KIND OF AVOIDING. THE GREATER QUESTION. WHICH IS WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT ABLE TO PAY RENT RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE BIG REASONS IS BECAUSE WE TOOK THEIR JOBS AWAY. AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL HEY THAT WAS DOLLARS FOR SAFETY PURPOSES. GOOD OKAY. BUT THEN WE FAILED TO PAY THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. AND WE HAVE AN EIGHTY DISS FAILED TO DO ITS JOB AND MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED THAT MAYBE WHAT LET THEM. PAY RENT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS SITUATION. AND YES MANY OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT THE PROBLEM HASN'T BEEN FIXED YET. YOU KNOW. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS HIGH COST OF LIVING RIGHT KILEY HIGH COST OF RENTS AND HOUSING WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. BY PASSING LEGISLATION WHICH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR YEARS TO REFORM SEQUEL. MISTER YOU'RE GETTING A RATHER BIT OFF TOPIC I WAS VERY MUCH ON TOP OF MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S EXPOSITORY AND IT'S NOT THESE ARE NOT ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL. THOSE ARE POLICIES THAT YOU'RE WELCOME TO. INTRODUCE YOUR OWN BILLS AND EXPOSE DISCUSS SO THAT YOU WANT BY THE DENTIST AND THEY'RE RELEVANT TO THIS TOPIC AND I'M A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND I WILL GIVE THE REASONS FOR WHY. I SUPPORTER DON'T SUPPORT THIS POLICY IN THIS BILL THAT IS BEFORE US. AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM OF A LACK OF HOUSING WE'VE LIMITED OUR HOUSING WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP AND THAT'S WHY RENTS ARE SO HIGH. THAT'S WHY COST OF HOUSING IS SO HIGH BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATORS REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE'VE ALSO ADDED TO THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AND I KNOW THE GOOD SENATOR. HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS IN HER DISTRICT BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT WE PASS. THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE ARE WHAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF ELECTRICITY FOR EXAMPLE. IN HIS WAS DRIVING UP THE COST OF GAS TO GET. TO A JOB YOU DON'T HAVE ANYMORE UNFORTUNATELY- SO. ALL THESE THINGS WE KIND OF AVOID TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE MAJORITY PARTY WOULD HAVE TO OWN UP. TO THE POLICY MISTAKES THAT THEY HAVE MADE. THAT HAVE LED TO THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW INSTEAD WE WANT TO PASS THE BUCK AWESOME UP SOMEHOW AND LANDLORDS THEY'RE STRUGGLING JUST AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW AND SO TO ME I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE MISSING THE BIGGER POINT HERE WE'RE MISSING THE BIG THE LARGER POINT IS A CALIFORNIA. HAS CREATED A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE WITH BAD POLICIES AND BAD GOVERNMENT. AND SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY. AND I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THOSE THINGS I JUST TALKED ABOUT LET'S HONE IN ON THOSE THINGS AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE CORRECTED. AND THEY'LL DO A WHOLE LOT MORE TO HELP TENANTS AND EVERYBODY. IN THE STATE AS ARE MOVING THROUGH THIS VERY TOUGH- AND TUMULTUOUS TIMES THANK YOU. IS THE MOST. THANK YOU. SO FIRST I ACTUALLY WANT TO THINK AND THE AUTHOR IN AUTHORS- FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION THIS IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION- IN OUR STATE AND WE DO HAVE A LOOMING EVICTION CRISIS IN OUR STATE. I CERTAINLY WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT ROOT CAUSES- BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION THAT IS IN FRONT OF US- AND I THINK IT'S A- VERY THE HOUSING CRISIS NO DOUBT. IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE WERE ADDRESSING PRIOR TO COBIT. AND CERTAINLY DURING THE WHOLE OF IT- I THINK THAT. MOST OF US AGREE THAT THE PROBLEM- THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATURE. AT AND I A THINK THAT THAT'S- A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION YOU'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN LEADING- A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION BUT THEY- THEY NEED TO HAPPEN- FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT TO THIS IS ONE OF A YOU KNOW DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT. ARE PART IN DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. I THINK I WANT TO ECHO JUST A COUPLE THINGS THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES- HAVE ECHOED. WHICH IS AT FIRST THE ISSUE RELATED TO- ELIGIBILITY FOR UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH AT LENGTH ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON KOBE IT. NOT JUST ON THE HEALTH SIDE ON THE EDUCATION SIDE ON THE HOUSING SIDE. ON EVERY SIDE- AND- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES. TO BE AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY. TO HELP ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND PERHAPS THIS IS A PART OF A BIGGER SOLUTION RIGHT- THAT. IN TERMS OF WHERE WE END UP ON ON THE HOUSING ISSUE- BUT CERTAINLY. AG IT MAKES ME AT YOUKNOW CRINGE TO THINK THAT WE COULD LEAVE ANYONE WHO CAN'T PROVIDE AND I TENER SOCIAL SECURITY OUT. OF A SOLUTION WHEN THEY ARE ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHERE THEY ARE. THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED. TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES BUT WE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO PROTECT THEM SO. I IN YOU ARE DEVOTED RESTING. THINKING ABOUT IT. I'M AT THE THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CONCERN THAT THAT I HAVE. AND THE OTHER IS RELATED TO. THE ADMINISTRATION OF TAX CREDIT SYSTEM. I THINK THE ANALYSIS FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD RAISE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. AND WHETHER OR NOT- THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF. WHETHER OR NOT THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. I THINK THE SYSTEM- OF LANDLORDS AND GREEN TO THE F. T. B. AND IF TO BE TRACKING TAX CREDITS- IS. IN RESOURCE INTENSIVE SYSTEM. AND CERTAINLY I EXPECT THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT IT SYSTEM OVERHAUL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AT TRACKING AND- YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED THAT. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS ALREADY SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO IT DOES IT DOES CONCERNS. AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME CREATE BUT I KNOW AGAIN THAT THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED- AND EVEN I THINK. AS WE LOOK AT THESE TWO ISSUES- JUST YOU KNOW THE OVERALL. ISSUES OF WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL HAVE AT LANDLORDS- WORK WITH THEIR TENANTS IN GOOD FAITH OR WILL YOU KNOW THIS RESORT TO SOME OTHER TYPES OF TACTICS THAT CAN SCARE. TENANTS FROM MOVING OUT- I KNOW THAT. THIS IS AGAIN ONE APPROACH I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT ACCORDING TO OUR LAST CENSUS 55% OF CALIFORNIANS LIVED IN A HOME THAT THE ACTUALLY OWNED- AND- THAT IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF STREAM. AND THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION DOESN'T SOLVE FOR THAT BUT I DO HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE 55% OF CALIFORNIANS. THAT ARE NOT RENTING- BUT THAT LIVE IN A HOME AND I THINK IT'S BEEN ALLUDED TO- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF MORTGAGES. AND WHAT KINDS OF ROLES AND THAT'S NOT THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT IT IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION SO I THINK MY COMMENTS- ARE. ARE DEFINITELY OF. RECOGNIZING THIS IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE I. BELIEVE WE THINK THIS. IS A SECONDING YOU HAPPEN. I'M NOT BILL. BUT I THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY COLLEAGUES WE WILL TO GET THIS RIGHT AND I KNOW YOU DO TOO AS WELL SO THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU HERE COMES. THIS PRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR BRING IN THE BILL THIS IS SUCH A SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUE AND I THINK WHAT I APPRECIATE THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION THE SUMMIT IN THE ASSEMBLY. ABSOLUTELY WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND A SOLUTION WE CANNOT LEAVE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER OR THE END OF AUGUST WITHOUT HAVING FOUND A SOLUTION SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY ON BOTH IN BOTH HOUSES PLUS THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION MEET NONE OF WHAT I HAVE READ IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION NOT HERE NOT IN ANY OTHER PROPOSAL. BUT I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS REMINDS US THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. I APPRECIATE SO MUCH THAT. WE NEED A HOUSE IS JUST COMPLAINING IT'S SO EASY TO COMPLAIN AND TO COMPLAIN AT THE PONTIFICATE ABOUT THE ISSUES. IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY SPEND THE TIME TO WORK ON THE SOLUTION. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING THAT'S WHAT THE ASSEMBLY IS DOING WITH THE AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX AS WELL. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I KNOW THAT YOU AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THIS. WE HAVE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT AE UNDOCUMENTED. RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIND PROTECTION AS TENANTS AS WELL. WE PRAISE THEM AS HEROES BECAUSE THERE ARE FRONT LINE WORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO UPLIFT THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE AND GET WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO SOMETHING THAT IS. MOVING THESE EVICTIONS THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE INCLUDED. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT EVERY SOLUTION THAT-IS BEING LOOKED AT IS WHAT IS CONSIDERING PROTECTING THE TENANTS WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. WITH THE INCREASED HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS THE BEST WAY IS TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE NOT FORGETTING THE LANDLORDS. THE VIRUS THAT IS AFFECTING ALL OF US. SHOULD NOT BE THAT THE COST OF IT SHOULD NOT BE BORNE BY LANDLORDS MANY OF WHOM HAVE INVESTED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO PURCHASE THESE RENTALS- THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO SUFFER THE MOST. THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED IN IN ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS IT HAS TO BE- LANDLORDS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE- FOR ALL ALL OF THE DEALS THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN CALIFORNIA- SO AGAIN I JUST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND ALL OF THE OTHERS- MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE SIMPLY MEMBERS LIMóN AND THE OTHERS. WHO ARE WORKING ON SOLUTIONS- THANK YOU IT'S THE HARD WORK THAT IN THE END IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE PROTECTION THAT CALIFORNIANS NEED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET ME. JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- FOR THE DIALOGUE AND THE EXPRESSED CONCERNS WE'VE TAKEN COPIOUS NOTES ON ALL OF THIS. THIS TICKET AND YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENTS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO END IT IS THIS IS A REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET GOOD DATA- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN A LOT OF THE DATA COMES TO US FROM. NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS BUT THE- THE INFORMATION SHOWS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAYING PART OF THE RENT IT'S NOT THAT THEY PAY THE RENT AT ALL IT'S THAT THEY'RE MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT AND- AND WHAT WHAT'S COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT IS YOU DON'T WANT TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN JUST WALK AWAY NOT TO PAY RENT ANYMORE IF YOU WANT THEM TO WORKING COOPERATE WITH THE LANDLORD BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE LANDLORD. IS MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS RIGHT THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ESPECIALLY THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS AND THERE ARE MORE THAN WE REALIZE- YEAH AND SO WHAT WHAT THE DATA SHOWS IN APRIL 24% OF THAT THE TENANTS. FAILED TO PAY ON TIME PARTIAL PAYMENTS AND THAT SO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 30% 31% THEY ENTER 1% IN JUNE AND- WE'RE REALLY TRYING. AND WE TO REWARD THAT IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- DISTANCE. ICING THEM WORK TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT WITH THEIR WITH THEIR LANDLORDS SO. LET ME DO THAT LET ME JUST WRAP UP BY SAYING- THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT AN FTP SOLUTION IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT. IT STARTS TO SET UP THIS BIG BUREAUCRACY AND IN REALITY. THE CHALLENGE BECOMES AS WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. IS WHO WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM. READ BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO KEEP TENANTS IN THEIR CURRENT RESIDENCES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT ON THE STREETS AND FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT NUMBER TWO THAT TO HELP. LANDLORDS MAKE THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH THE WHOLE RUSSIA OF MORTGAGE DEFAULTS BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HELP US EITHER BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET RID OF A TENANT IF THIS IF THE- THE UNIT HAS SOLD IT BECOMES A LOT EASIER- AS A GENERAL RULE. AND SO WE WANT TO KEEP. LANDLORDS HOLE. AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THE FISC OF THE STATE WE DON'T WANT TO SET UP THIS HUGE LIABILITY SO THAT WE- WE THEN HAVE TO GO TURN AROUND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT. BUT WHAT RESOURCES WERE CUTTING FROM OUR STATE BUDGET BECAUSE WE'VE ASSUMED A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON WITH WITH DOING A TAX CREDIT IS TO PUSH. SOME OF THE STATE LIGHT BURKE THE STATE IN GAUGING IN THIS PROCESS LIABILITY DOWN. DOWN THE ROAD AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO RECOVER A LITTLE BIT SO. SO AS AS WE O THROUGH THIS WE WANT TO MAKE IT A SIMPLE PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS- BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE WAYS FOR US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO WEEK BE ABLE TO CREATE A COMMITMENT. TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR IN THE RESIDENCE IS INSTALLED IT TOO I SYSTEM. TENANTS AS WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE FOUND IS THAT THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM IS- IS DIFFICULT WITH A LOT OF TIME YOU CAN SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS KIND OF AS WERE. THE TWO THAT BUTTON THAT. IS BEING BUILT AS AS YOU KNOW WERE CRASHING OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANALOGY IS BUT ANYWAY IN ANY CASE- WE'RE ALL WORKING. ON THIS. KATE ALL THE- WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT AND WE WANT TO GET A RIDE SO THAT PEOPLE. AS WE DEAL WITH THIS CORONA VIRUS ANDEMIC WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH UNKNOWN OUT THERE THAT THERE'S SOME SOME KNOWN THAT THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR PLACES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY AND WE THEY CAN SHELTER IN PLACE AND THEY HAVE THE SHELTER SO. APPRECIATE ALL YOUR COMMENTS AND KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING HARD AND I'M GONNA BE WORKING- ALONG SIDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT WITH TE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS TO TAKE CARE OF- BOB WHAT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. THAT I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE IT MANAGING EXPECTATIONS. BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL NOT SOLVE ALL THE DEALS THAT WE HAVE AROUND HOUSING AND- AFFORDABILITY AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO- THAT I THINK THE CLOSER WE GET TO BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS I THINK THAT. THAT WE ALL HAD WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS- IT'S- THE BETTER WILL BE SO I GET RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TO KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING. AND MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS THAT I'M IN A- WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT I AM AND WILL WILL DO IT WITH THE COOPERATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE ASSEMBLY AND THIS. THANK SAID BRADFORD DID YOU. WANT UP I'LL BE BRIEF I JUST WANNA OF COLD MUCH OF WHAT IS BEEN SAID BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S- ANY TAKEAWAY THAT WE CANNOT LEAVE HERE WITH THE DATE. WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE. AND WHEN WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS- MEASURE FIVE MONTHS AGO. LANDLORDS WORD. AT THE CENTER OF THIS DISCUSSION JUST AS MUCH AS TENANTS. BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND. MANY OF THOSE SMALL LANDLORDS. ARE SOME MORE MEMBERS OF THIS INSTITUTION AS WELL. MANY OF THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS ARE MEMBERS OF THIS INSTITUTION. MANY OF WHOM LIVE IT CONVERSATIONS WITH AND- THEY'VE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IT TAX CREDIT. MEANS TO ME TODAY ONE I HAVE TO PAY MY MORTGAGE. AND SO WORKING ON THAT WE UNDERSTAND WE SAT DOWN WITH THE FRANCHISE THAT. WE SEE DOWN WITH BREAKING IT AND INDUSTRY WEALTH THE SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS. MONETIZE THEM AND MAKE A WE SAT DOWN WITH TO TREASURE. ALSO TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOME SECURITIZATION THAT WOULD BE USED. AND THESE TAX CREDITS WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL THESE THINGS IS IT PERFECT NOW. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE ASSUMING GALLAGHER MENTIONED THAT HAS IMPEDED US FROM BUILDING FORMA HOUSING BILLS ARE TRUE WE DO NEED TO BUILD MORE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT AGAIN THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. BUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE NIMBYISM ALSO IF MANY MEMBERS IN THEIR DISTRICT DON'T WANT TO FOR AWHILE THEN IT AND THERE DISTRICTS SO THAT ADDS TO THE PROBLEM AS WELL. SO I THINK WE CAN AWAY FROM ANYTHING ARE OFTEN. THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE. I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU. I LOGIC CUMMINGS. STATED AND HE SAYS THE BILL NOTHING ISN'T NOTHING. THAT'S WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY MEMBERS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO NOTHING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR UNCLE. THANK YOU LOOKING FOR A MOTION MOTION IS SOME OF THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS. CULTURAL PLEASE. STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO SHOW.

SENATOR US ALL RIGHT I'M NUMBER WE IS SENATE BILL ELEVEN. OPERATOR FOR WHO LIKE TO CALL IN THIS TO BE A TIME CALL A ON SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINE. IF YOU WANT TO. TESTIFY OR SUPPORTER OPPOSE. SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINE. SO WE WILL START THE WITH THE OPENING STATEMENT SENATOR MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN THIS OF THINGS AND- BECAUSE THIS PREVIOUS THAT YOU'RE LISTENING THIS. ALMOST SMALL VERSION OF BUT OF VERY PART OF WHAT MANY FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMPREHENSIVE. GIVEN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH DANGERS CAUSED BY GROUP IN NINETEEN THE STATE- SHOULD FOCUS ON KEEPING CALIFORNIANS IN THE HOME BUT IN A SAFE HOME. I AM PROPOSING TO AND STABILIZATION PROVISIONS FOR TENANTS EXPERIENCING THE MOST VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS BEING A BIT OF A VIOLENT CRIME. UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY HOME IS SAFE THE WORLD HAS SEEN HOW THE COOPER NINETEEN TERM PLACE PROTECT HAVE LED TO AN INCRESE IN INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE VICTIMS AY LIVE WITH OR LIVE NEAR THEIR PERPETRATORS. FOR THE MORE. LOW YOUNG. AT THE MUSICAL BEAR THE- OF. XP DURING A TIME OF EXACERBATED FINANCIAL AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. AND INCREASE VULNERABILITY FOR MANY VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE MORE URGENT NOW THAN EVER.CALIFORNIA LAW INSURERS TODAY THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. STALKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF AN ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT AND FAMILY MEMBERS. FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD CAN TERMINATE A LEASE WITHOUT PENALTY FOLLOWING THE VICTIMIZATION. SB ELEVEN NINETY WOULD EXPAND THESE TENANT- THESE EXISTING TENNIS STABILIZATION PROTECTIONS. TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE ARMED HOME INVASION OR CALL VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE. VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES AND THEIR FAMILIES HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS CAN TERMINATE AND- WITHOUT T. WITHIN A HUNDRED DAYS FOLLOW THE CRIME. SB ELEVEN NINETY WILL ENSURE THAT LAND DID NOT DISCLOSE AGAINST TENANTS. BY REFUSING TO RENT TO TENANTS. FOR BREAKING THE LEASE SUBJECT TO RIGHTS THE BILL ALSO EXPANDS APPROVAL TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSEHOLD. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR URGENT SITUATIONS LIKE WHEN THE VICTIM IS SEVERELY INJURED AND NEEDS ROUND THE CLOCK CARE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD AND AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER MUST RELOCATE TO PROVIDE THE VICTIM WITH CARE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS WHEN ATTENDING CAN NO LONGER AFFORD THE RENT AFTER PAYING FOR FUNERAL OR BURIAL EXPENSES OF A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS A HOMICIDE VICTIM. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS TENNIS STABILIZATION PROVISION HAS IT EXISTING RIGOROUS CERTIFICATION AND DOCUMENTED DOCUMENTATION PROCESS. THE TENANT MUST PROVIDE THIRD PARTY VERIFIED DOCUMENTATION TO THE LANDLORD WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS FOLLOWING THE CRIME THIS COULD BE A RESTRAINING ORDER POLICE REPORT- MEDICAL REPORT. ARE YOU TO SUPPORT THE HOUSING SECURITY OF TENANTS IT'S RAISING THE MOST VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE NEWEST SET OF AMENDMENTS THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION AND NOW HAS A NEUTRAL POSITION. FOR THESE REASONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BRING SB ELEVEN NINETY BEFORE YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

HERE IT IS AS WELL AS WHAT'S THE TO BE A PART OF NOT PASSED AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WHEN ARE GOING. COME SUCH YOU KNOW IS THIS BILL WOULD OPEN A THAT KIND OF WAIVER FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS RESOURCES THAT WERE ONLY KIND OF LIMITED TO CERTAIN SURVIVORS OF CERTAIN CRIMES YES SO WHEN YOU OPEN THAT UP TO FOCUS WHILE STILL YOU KNOW PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION WHICH I'M VERY GLAD WAS MENTIONED IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW TO HOPEFULLY CIRCUMVENT AN ADDITIONAL CYCLE OF TRAUMA FROM CONTINUING BECAUSE- IT'S ALREADY A DRAMATIC SITUATION TO BE IN WANT ONE SOMEBODY A VICTIM.

AND I WILL ALLOW MY- WITNESS TO SPEAK BUT I THINK THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT NOW GIVEN THAT WE ARE ONCE AGAIN IN A- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND WE-HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF MANY CALIFORNIANS BEING FACED WITH FORECLOSURE WELL THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT FORECLOSURE SOMEONE TO BE CLEAR WILL NOT PREVENT THEM WE WILL HAVE MUCH TO DO OTHER THINGS TO TRY TO PREVENT THOSE. BUT WHAT IT IS AIMED AT IS RIPPER VETTING THE SCENARIO THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST RECESSION WHERE A HANDFUL OF LARGE CORPORATIONS SNATCHED UP MANY MANY CALIFORNIA SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AT AUCTION IN BOTH. PLEASE PAYING CASH AND THEN EITHER LEFT THEM VACANT IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS OR CREATED A NEW ASSET CLASS OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME RENTALS WITH REALLY EGREGIOUS PLEASE PRESS PROVISIONS- I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE DETAILS BUT I ALLOW MY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AND OTHER PEOPLE TO SPEAK THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED IN SUPPORT ROBERT APODACA FROM THE. TWO HUNDRED MISTER PRODUK ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YEAH RIGHT PLEASE. PROCEED BUT GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY- COMMITTEE- ROBERT PAPA DOC A CO FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE TWO HUNDRED OF OUR MISSION IS TO ERADICATE POVERTY AND NARAL THE BALK UP OF UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP- MANY MEMBERS OF OUR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OR ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU- ON A DAY ARE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER JO KOTAL FORMER SENATOR- DON COLLADO. A FORMER CABINET MEMBER SENT BACK PEAK JOHN CAMPBELL WHO IS THE CO FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA- COMMITTEE BUILDERS- AND HERMAN GUY EAGLES OF WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ABOUT THE NON OWNERS. WHO NEED THIS US. I'M MORE DWELL ON WHAT KOBE BECAUSE IS DOING TO CAL. ARE WITH OTHERS AND COUNTRY BUT FOR SURE IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN A LOT OF MANY HOMES. FORECLOSURES SIMILAR TO THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION- JUST AS A REMINDER- THERE'S OUT OF THERE THERE HAS BEEN A- SEVERE REDUCTION HOMEOWNERSHIP AMONG BLACK AND LATINOS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. M. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO INCREASE THE HOMEOWNERSHIP AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BOB IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LATEST UPDATED THAT'S AVAILABLE OF LATINOS HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE WAS FORTY THREE POINT NINE PERCENT. WHICH IS FOUR POINT 5% IN THE HEIGHT OF THE OWNERSHIP AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO BUT YOU KNOW PROBABLY NOT. FULLY RECOVERED. GREAT RISK. FROM THE LOSS OF MOBILE HOMES. SIMILARLY OF BLACKS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OH HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE WAS THIRTY FOUR POINT 4% WHICH IS FIVE POINT 6% LESS THAN THE HEIGHT OF THE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THREE TWO THOUSAND SOME TEAM- BY COMPARISONS. HOMEOWNERSHIP RIGHT NOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO SIXTY THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND THEY HAVE I HAVE ALMOST RECOVERED OF THE OTHER LOSSES. THAT THEY STILL LAGGING.

IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. IT ACTUALLY SO. THE SALE PROCESS AND THEN THE REPAIRS RENOVATION AND RETURNING THOSE HOMES TO THE MARKET PLACE FOR SALE OR FOR RENT AND WE SIMPLY THINK THAT THAT PROVISION WOULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND SHOULD BE RETHOUGHT.

NOT TAKING ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME WHICH YOU DID AND THEN DOES YOUR POST THE BILL. THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THANK YOU. FIVE YES I AM- ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE AND OFFERED ONLINE CAN QUEUE THANK YOU IS MISTER BELOW IT ON THE LINE. I AM MR THANK YOU THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON OUR LIST BUT AS OPPOSITION VOTE WERE. WAS NOT LISTED SO I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO REGISTER YOUR- OPPOSITION. YOU CAN HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU I AM APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS- A COUPLE OF QUICK CUTS THIS IS MIKE BELOW ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED TRUSTEES ASSOCIATION COUPLE QUICK. PRELIMINARY COMMENTS FIRST WE UNDERSTAND. AND APPRECIATE SENATOR SKINNER'S- OBJECTIVES TO ENCOURAGE OWNER OCCUPANCY OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND SECONDLY. YOU KNOW SHE AND HER STAFF AND MR MAGNATE. HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME AND TALKING THROUGH THE ISSUES IN THE BILL- YOUR CONCERNED ABOUT A FORTY FIVE DAY A PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED INTO THE BILL AS OF TODAY. WE HAVE CLEARLY VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUE FACING THE LEGISLATURE ON THOSE SINCE THE CREATION OF NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE IN THE THIRTIES- THE WHOLE POINT OF THE TRUSTEE'S SALE WAS TO MAXIMIZE THE SALE PRICE OF THE HOUSE THAT WAY WE DO PUBLICATION OF NOTICES POSTING OF THE PROPERTY NOTICES TO VARIOUS PERSONS AND IT'S REALLY NOT FOR THE LENDER THE LENDER IS GOING TO GET THEIR INDEBTEDNESS RECOVERED IN THE FORECLOSURE SALE IT'S REALLY FOR THE HOMEOWNER. BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNER IS ENTITLED TO PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE ABOUT THE SALE PRICE COPY- AT THE END OF. SO THE POINT IS TO MAX. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS FORTY FIVE DAY PROVISION WHILE WELL INTENTIONED WILL IN FACT BITTING AND HARM HOMEOWNERS- WHAT YOU'RE ASKING TO DO IS PUT UP CASH AND THEN SEE OVER A FORTY FIVE DAY PERIOD WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WILL BE THE HIGH BIDDER OR NOT AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN DURING THAT TIME THERE'S A NUMBER OF NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN THE HEIGHT BIDDER CAN GO BANKRUPT THE HIGH BIDDER. THERE NINE AND CAN THE SENATE AND BY THE PRO. THERE'S ALSO OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN THAT TIME AND WILK WILL CONCERN THEY SIMPLY WON'T DO IT OR THEY WON'T BID AS HIGH AS THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT. BECAUSE OF THIS RISKAND THE RISK OF HAVING MONEY TIED UP FOR A MONTH AND A HALF SECONDLY NO ONE IS. HAS ANY INCENTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY DURING THAT TIME NOT THE- HOMEOWNER WHO IS IN DANGER OF LOSING THE HOUSE NOT ATTENDED IF THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN RENTED. CANNOT BE- BLEND WHO DOESN'T OWN THE PROPERTY AT THAT POINT AND WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MAINTAIN IT. SO AGAIN WHILE THE WHILE THE PROVISION AS WELL INTENTIONED WE UNDERSTAND SENATORS- DESIRE HERE. BUT WE ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT RATHER THAN A POSITIVE ONE. WE TO WORK ABILITY IS THAT WERE DISCUSSED THE SENATOR PER THE POLICY ISSUE IS WHAT I WANTED TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR I'M. NOT INSULTING ME. THANK YOU. I WILL GO BACK TO THE PHONES FOR YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND THAT YOU OPPOSE SB TEN SEVENTY NINE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE QUEUE. THERE'S NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THE MOMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO QUEUE UP YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO. NO ONE ON THE PHONE AT THIS TIME SIR. RIGHT THANK YOU THEN YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINES FOR SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY NINE. NO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR KILEY. I THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER AYE I LIKE THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL A LOT BUT I FIND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION- PRETTY PERSUASIVE AS FAR AS THE INCENTIVES THIS WILL CREATE- AND- SOME OF THESE OTHER HARM SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO IT AND THE SOME OF HIS POINTS MISTER RAISED ABOUT- INCENTIVES TO MAKE. YES MY HARM HOMEOWNERS. WELL IT DOESN'T HARM THE HOMEOWNER BECAUSE IN THE THIS BILL IS ONLY IMPACTING FORECLOSED PROPERTY SO THE HOMEOWNERS ALREADY FACING THE SITUATION OF THEIR PROPERTY BEING FORECLOSED BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS GIVE THAT HOMEOWNER IF THEY CAN'T IN THE FORTY FIVE DAY WINDOW- PUT TOGETHER A BID THAT WOULD MEET. THE BID THAT WAS FIRST INITIATED IN THE AUCTION TO BE ABLE TO BUY TO GET THEIR HOPE. AND CERTAINLY IN THE LAST FORECLOSURE CRISIS WE SAW IN EXPERIENCE THAT MANY OF THOSE WERE FORECLOSED ON. IT WAS DUE TO THE TERMS OF THEIR LOAN. AND THAT THE- IN THE U. THEY WERE GIVEN BAD LOAN BY A LENDER AND THAT IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY WITHOUT CAPITAL OR CASH THEY JUST COULD NOT MEET THE TURN THEIR FELT PROPERTY WAS NO LONGER THE SAME VALUE AND THEY COULD NOT MEET THE TERMS OF THAT EXISTING LONG SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS EXISTED DURING THE LAST FORECLOSURE CRISIS WE MAY HAVE HAD MORE OF THOSE. HOMEOWNERS FACING FORECLOSURE BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE THEIR HOME NOW THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT CORPORATE PURCHASED OF HOMES IT'S NOT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS BY IN THAT WINDOW. IF THE INITIAL BID. A CORP ENTITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER PUTS IN. A HIGH BID. THEN THERE'S A FORTY FIVE DAY WINDOW FOR THE TENANTS. OR THE OWNER OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ENTITY TO BE ABLE TO- OUTBID THAT. IF THERE'S NO OUT BEATING OF IT THEN WHOEVER PUT IN THAT INITIAL BID. GETS TO PROCEED WITH THE SALE. SO YES THERE IS A FORTY FIVE DAY WINDOW WHERE THE HOME THAT WAS UNDER FORECLOSURE WOULD CONCEIVABLY AMIN IN THE WORST CASE. ATTENTION WE SOMEONE NOT MAINTAIN IT BUT- WE HAD A MUCH HIGHER SPECTER OF ENTITIES THAT BOUGHT HOMES DURING THE LAST FORECLOSURE CRISIS WHO LEFT THOSE HOMES BIT VACANT. AND THERE WERE- I HAVE A VIVID MEMORY DURING THAT TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF HALF WALKING WITH THE CITY MANAGER OF RICHMOND. AND AT A DIFFERENT TIME WALKING WITH CITY OFFICIALS IN OAKLAND HE THROUGH CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE EVERY THIRD HOME WAS COMPLETELY ABANDONED HAD BEEN STRIPPED OF ALL OF ITS WIRES. STRIPPED OF PIPE STRIPPED OF THE REFER PEOPLE WHO WERE- THEN TRYING TO RECOVER THAT VALUE AND- HE PACKED ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS HORRIBLE WE'RE NOT GOING TO FACE THAT TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT. IT IS NOT A- THE FORTY FIVE DAY WINDOW IS IN AND OF ITSELF MINIMAL. SO WELL CERTAINLY IN A WORST CASE WHAT- MISTER BELOW IMAGINED MIGHT OCCUR IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT WOULD BE FEW. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISSOURI THANK YOU AT FIRST I WANT TO START OFF BY WISHING THE SENATOR A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND THEN I WANT TO MENTION IT JUST THAT YOU KNOW IN THE LAST CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT PRIOR BILLS THIS IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE ASSEMBLY BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT FOR CLOSURE DATE AT- FOR THE LAST RECESSION BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND WE WERE SADLY REMINDED THAT IMPACTED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT LITTLE NUMBERS- AND SO I THINK THAT WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS- IS NOT EXASPERATED DURING THIS RECESSION IS IMPORTANT. AND I THINK YOU'VE MADE AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES- AND CERTAINLY IS PART OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW WE KEEP- INDIVIDUALS IT IN THEIR HOME BUT ALSO ALLOW THAT THE HOUSING MARKET IS ACCEPTABLE AT EVERY BE CALLOUS AND- IN AN EQUAL AND- AND IN A WAY THAT'S MORE YOU KNOW. MORE THIRTY AND THEN FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN COME IN AND GIVE UP SOME OF THIS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE. YOUR QUESTION. YEAH I AM I APPRECIATE THE CAN AND HEARING FROM THE IN YOUR- I GUESS MY EXPERIENCE IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT DIFFERENT AND I MEAN WHAT I'VE SEEN IS YOU KNOW THAT- FOR SOME PEOPLE BODIES OF FORECLOSURE THEY TURN AROUND AND RUN ABOUT TWO PEOPLE AND THAT PROVIDES HOUSING A LOT OF TIMES THEY RENOVATE THAT PROPERTY AND THEY CAN BRING IT UP. TO A BETTER STANDARD AND THEN RE RENTED OUT- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEN HAPPEN IN THE MARKET- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT YOU SEE IN YOU KNOW IN YOUR PARTICULAR DISTRICT BUT I GUESS I WOULD GET THAT IS AN ISSUE I WOULD WANT TO SEE SOMETHING IS MORE SPECIFIC TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THERE MAYBE IT'S A LOCAL SOLUTION MAYBE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO PROTECT. DRESS THAT BUT IT JUST IT IT SEEMS. SOMEWHAT UNFAIR TO ME THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE ANYBODY CAN COME YOU KNOW AND BID ON THAT PROPERTY IF IT'S UP TO FORECLOSURE INCLUDING THE TENANTS. INCLUDING NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING GREAT WORK AND COMMITTEE PROVIDING A RENTAL- PROPERTIES AND- AND PROVIDING AFFORDABLE- RENTALS. EVERYBODY CAN SHOP EVERYBODY HAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THAT PROPERTY AND THEN PUT IT TAKE TO GET USE AND SO I JUST I DON'T SEE THE REASON TO. SOMEHOW GAME THAT SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT AND SAY OKAY WE'LL BUT OKAY YOU DID WHEN YOU GOT THE BID THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS. PEOPLE HAVE TO COME IN AND JUST KIND OF. A ONE DOLLAR MORE. IT TO ME DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE MOST AFFECTED WERE FAIR PROCESS. AND AGAIN NOT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THE MARKET REALLY DOES SEEM TO WORK- IN PROVIDING FOR UPGRADED AND MORE HOUSING AND RENTALS- I'M JUST NOT SEEN THE NEED TO ESTABLISH THIS IS A STATE WIDE POLICY YEAH THOUGH I DO. I MEAN I'M LISTEN I'M HEARING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THE EAST BAY- AND CERTAINLY THAT'S A PROBLEM. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE ISSUE BUT TO RESPOND CERTAINLY I GAVE YOU A PERSONAL EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE BUT IT WAS NOT UNIQUE BUT LET'S LET'S SET THAT ASIDE USE THE TERM GAMING I THINK ONE COULD SAY THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PREVENT THE GAMING OF A SYSTEM THAT WERE ACTUALLY. LEVEL THE OWNER OCCUPANT WHO'S UNDER FORECLOSURE FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO. LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING GOES ON TO AN AUCTION THE WAY THAT MANY OF THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS HALF AND SO UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM AN ENTITY. THE COMBINED BALK WITH CASH HAS THE ADVANTAGE SO THIS IS TRYING TO CREATE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO THAT. OTHER ENTITIES THAT ALSO DESERVE TO OWN HOMES WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE. AND I THINK IF WE- I MENTIONED AND I THINK THE- OR MISTRUST A DOCTOR FROM ONE HUNDRED. THAT NOT ONLY WELL. THERE WAS A GROUP THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN BLACK AND LET LET NEXT HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN GENERAL THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HOME OWNER OCCUPANT HOMEOWNERSHIP THREATS TO CALIFORNIA WHICH STILL HAS NOT RECOVERED. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. WHAT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP REPRESENTS IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THE ABILITY FOR IT FOR CREATING RETIREMENT SECURITY GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND SO MUCH MORE IT SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO OWN AN OCCUPIED THEIR HOME HAVE AT LEAST AS FEAR OF AN ADVANTAGE IN A PROCESS LIKE THIS AS AN ENTITY THAT HAS ACCESS TO A LOT OF CASH. JUST AS A QUICK FALL TO THAT I MEAN I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID THE LAST PART OF WHAT YOU SAID THERE. BUT IN TERMS OF I MEAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT FOR CLOSURES THERE IS A NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. AND THEY'RE USUALLY POSTED IN NEWSPAPERS SO AND I THINK IT'S AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS. SO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NOTICE OF THE FACT IT THIS PROPERTY IS UP FOR FORECLOSURE. AND SO FREEZING LIKE ONLY THE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY QUICKLY I MEAN EVERYBODY HAS THAT SAME NOTICE IN A PUBLIC. A FORMER NEWSPAPER OTHERWISE. AT WHICH THEY COULD. COME UP WITH THE CASH OR NOT SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE PROCESS THE EXISTING. PROCESS SORT OF BELIES WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT CAN COME UP REALLY QUICKLY WITH MONEY AND AGAIN I MEAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AT THAT TIME. WHAT'S TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN IN FORTY FIVE DAYS I MEAN THAT'S NOT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF TIME THERE IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAD THIRTY DAYS. FOR INSTANCE BUT I MEAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ON THAT PROCESS. WELL THERE IS SOME NOTICE THERE'S ALSO UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE BALK AUCTION WHICH IT GIVES AN ADVANTAGE TO AN ENTITY THAT CAN PURCHASE MULTIPLE AT ONCE. VERSUS THE PERSON WHO'S JUST TRYING TO BUY THAT SINGLE PROPERTY EITHER THE OWNER OCCUPANT OR THE TENANT. THIS SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THIS DOES FALL INTO THE CATEGORIES MISS LIMóN SAID OF. SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING GIVEN WHAT'S COMING BUT TO ME IT ALSO FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST HOUSING CRISIS. I CAN REMEMBER THROUGH THAT CRISIS PEOPLE AT THE COUNTY STEPS WHO HAD THE RESOURCES THE FACILITIES SNATCHING UP HOMES. THROUGH THE OPTIONS IN THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS IN IN A WAY THAT REALLY FOR PRECLUDED OTHERS INTO MANY OF THOSE. WERE BOUGHT ON SPECULATION NOT ACTUALLY OCCUPIED AND WE ALSO HAD IN MORE RURAL AREAS. A LOT OF HOMES NOT BEING OCCUPIED% THAT THEN BECAME PROBLEMS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS SO I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE STEP AND- EIGHT A VERY GOOD SOLUTION THAT. THAT HELPS. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD LEARNED ABOUT BEFORE THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS. VERY IMPORTANT POLICY. SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE BILL WAS AMENDED PREVIOUSLY SO WHAT'S BEFORE US HERE IS JUST A RECOMMENDATION. THE MOTION OF THE TO PASS OR- NOT TO PASS AS AMENDED BECAUSE THOSE WE TOOK THEM RIGHT DOESN'T YET THE AMENDMENTS WERE BECAUSE WE HAD SO MUCH TO HELP. RIGHT WE ARE ABLE TO PROCESS PREVIOUSLY PROCESS THE AMENDMENTS JUST JUST FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT. RIGHT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU ARE TOO GOOD DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE. BY BOTH. THANK YOU. SO LOOKING FOR A WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASS. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE HI GALLAGHER. CHAU. TO AND SALAS HI GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY.

ONE IT REQUIRES THAT ATTORNEYS ACCEPT SERVICE ELECTRONICALLY OTHER SHOULD BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO- MOST ATTORNEYS ARE DOING THAT SUMMER BEING DIFFICULT THIS ELIMINATES THAT. OPTION BEING DIFFICULT NUMBER TWO IT ALSO PROVIDES REMOTE DEPOSITIONS- DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM BUT PROVIDES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT REMOTE DEPOSITIONS AND THREE IT- MOVES THE DATES THAT ARE ATTENDED TO THE TRIAL DATE WITH THE TRIAL DATE LET ME EXPLAIN.

REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT OF THE STIPULATIONS FOR RECEIVING NOTICES BY LAWYERS THIS IS SIMPLE COMMON SENSE. AS TO THE REMOTE DEPOSITION ALL THE BILL ALL THE BILL REALLY DOES IS ALLOW THE DEPONENT AND THE COURT REPORTER TO BE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED- IF THE- NOTICING PARTY THAT DESIGNATES THAT AND A COMMONSENSE APPROACH DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR SURE- THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY TO OVERSTATE WHAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING THE CHAOS IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE- CRIMINAL CASES PILING UP IT'S GOING TO BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE CAN CONDUCT JURY TRIALS.

HI ANDY WE'VE BEEN BOND JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. BETTER CARE THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL NOW THEN MOVED TO OPPOSITION I HAVE LISTED DAS YOU AND ON THIS OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION WITH HERNANDEZ ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM THE SECRETARY THANK YOU. NOT SURE HERNANDEZ ON THE HOUSE. THANK YOU- NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION INCLUSIVE OF OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS A COURT ROOMS AS WELL AS DEPOSITION OFFICERS. AND OTHERS- WE DO HAVE AN UP CLOSE ENOUGH AMENDED POSITION AND WITH OUR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WE WILL NOT ONLY REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THAT WE WOULD JUST SUPPORT- LET ME CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS. ON THE LETTER OF THE LAW CURRENT LAW- DID NOT PROVIDE MUCH FLEXIBILITY FOR REMOTE DEPOSITIONS YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HAVE A PROBLEM. UNDER CURRENT LAW- IT'S THAT A PARTY TO A CASE MAY NOT APPEAR FIVE REMOTE B. AND ONLY WITNESSES THAT ARE NOT PART USE MAY APPEAR BY TELEPHONE. AND ONLY AFTER A COURT ORDER SO CERTAIN. THE STATUTE YEP THE AN FBI FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER THAT. CHANGE IN GENERALLY WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT. THE ONE CONCERN THAT WE HOUSE. IS THAT HAVE SB ELEVEN FORTY SIX WAS DRAFTED IT OPENED UP WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION UTILITY OF A DEPOSITION RECORDER TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA LIVING OUT BY CALIFORNIA. ZOOM INTO CALIFORNIA FOR WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A CALIFORNIA DEPOSITION EVEN IF DECENT VISUALS ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA BESIDES WHERE OUT OF STATE OR ANY WORDS IN THE SALEABLE WE THINK THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC IT GOES TOO FAR TOO SOON. THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE A FACT AND REALLY BE IMPLEMENTED AFTER THE EMERGENCY ORDERS ARE LOOKED AT- AND AT THAT JUNCTURE WE DO SUPPORT HAPPENED BUT BELIEVE YOU TO HELP YOU WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY JOHN THAT. YEAH A LOT MORE WORK THAN. THE FACT THAT HAVE NEVER. STATE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OF STATE COMPANIES THAT HAVE TARGETED CAL. FOR OUT OF STATE REPORTER AND CAT COURTROOM HAPPY HAPPY YET. IN ORDER TO DO TO CALIFORNIA TO. THIS WHAT IMPACT THE WORK. ARE YOU CAL WE'RE ALSO OPEN UP OF WHAT HAPPENS TO EXIT BETTER TRANSFER TO SOMEONE WHO IS OUT OF STATE. SO OUR SUGGESTIONS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD SB ELEVEN FORTY SIX WITH ONE EXCEPTION KEEP CURRENT LAW. ONLY FOR THOSE DEPOSITIONS REPORTERS WHO ARE PHYSICALLY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE DEPOSITION. SO JUST KEEP CALIFORNIA LAW FOR THAT. I'M THAT WAY COULD BE BY COURT ORDER OR WHATEVER THE REQUIREMENTS ARE UNDER CURRENT LAW WE GOT A BIG HUGE STILL HUGE IMPROVEMENT OVER CURRENT LAW. YEAH I THINK WE SUGGESTED THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO APPS HAVE THE REPORTER STATE ON THE RECORD WHEN YOU'RE SHE STATE NAME. AND OTHER INFORMATION OF WHERE HE OR SHE IS AFTER THE QUICK BUT IN CALIFORNIA THE OUTSIDE A COUPLE OF WEEKS SO THERE'S CLEARLY THAT CALIFORNIA LAW APPLIED. AND THAT AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WITH THOSE TWO WOMEN WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. AND WE WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL WE BELIEVE THE COURT GOING GOING TO RESUME. WE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE OF THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY SIX. C. NINE ANYONE IN THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. SEEING NONE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE OPERATOR NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE ANYONE TELEPHONICALLY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY SIX. YOU SPEAK OUT POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND AS A REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. AND MISTER KERR NOBODY'S QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME TENS JUST GIVE IT ANOTHER. LITTLE BIT ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY SIX PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. OPERATED THAT CATCH ANYONE. NOBODY HAS QUEUED UP SIR OKAY THANK YOU YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINES FOR SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY SIX WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GALLAGHER YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR AND I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL- I DID I DID WANT TO MAYBE. GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM OPPOSITION. I THINK ONE OF THEM WAS THE ISSUE OF YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW ALL GROUP THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE A LICENSE TO THE DEPOSITION REPORTER IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S APPEARS THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE UNDER THIS BILL- AND THEN. YOU KNOW THE ONE AREA WHERE I THINK. WE KIND OF DO NEEDS AND AT LEAST AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN PERSON IS DEPOSITIONS. YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN A DEPOSITION. THAT THAT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE CAUGHT. IF IT'S REMOTE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE. THERE'S A GLITCH AND- SOMETIMES INAUDIBLE- IN A MOST DEPOSITIONS THAT I'VE BEEN IN. YOU KNOW IT IS USUALLY IN A CONFERENCE ROOM WHERE YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE SPREAD OUT THE PEOPLE COULD BE WEARING MASKS SO. YOU KNOW IF THE PARTIES I GUESS BOTH PARTIES THAT ARE IN THE LAWSUIT OR WANTING TO HAVE AN IN PERSON DEPOSITION IF WE PUT IT UP TO THE DEPONENT TO SAY. WELL NO I WANTED TO BE ALL REMOTE. DOES THAT SOMEHOW BECAUSE A PROBLEM I JUST THINKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES I COULD SEE HOW THAT. YOU KNOW MIGHT POSE A PROBLEM FOR GETTING YOU KNOW TO THE JUSTICE OF THE CASE AND GETTING YOU KNOW GETTING DOWN TO THE NOT SYMBOLS OF THE CASE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A GOOD CLEAR RECORD. RIGHT AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING YOUR CASE SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ON THE DEPOSITION. FROM SURE- MISTER CHAIR PLEASE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER- I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK MOST PRACTITIONERS WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT HAVING THE COURT REPORTER PRESENT PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT THE LOCATION OF THE DEPONENT IS CERTAINLY PREFERABLE FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU JUST MENTIONED- IN THIS BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. A COURT REPORTER FOR BEING PRESENT DOESN'T PRECLUDE ATTORNEY FROM BEING PRESENT UP FOR THE DEPOSITION. WHAT WHAT I THINK MISTER HERNANDEZ IS SAYING IS THAT FOR OUT OF STATE DEPOSITIONS OR FOR DEPOSITIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU YOU NEED TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA REPORTER. BOB IS A PRACTICAL MATTER THERE ARE. OBLIQUE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEPOSITIONS THAT ARE TAKEN EVERY DECADE MAYBE THOUSANDS OF TAKEN EVERY YEAR OUT OF STATE I'VETAKEN I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TWO HUNDRED DEPOSITIONS OUT OF STATE AND YOU HAVE A COURT REPORTER FROM THAT LOCALE. OF THE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TODAY NOR SHOULD THERE BE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE A COURT REPORTER WHOSE LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU'RE TAKING A DEPOSITION IN NEW YORK- I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS I DON'T THINK THOSE CONCERNS ARE GOING TO BE REALIZED IN IN A IS- YOU PROBABLY SEE IN THE ANALYSIS THE- COURT REPORTING- COURT REPORTERS BOARD SUPPORTS THE BILL AS WELL AS THE- DEPOSITION COURT REPORTERS- ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THE BILL THIS HAS NO IMPACT ON CORPUS. THIS ONLY APPLIES TO DEPOSITIONS. AND THEN JUST QUICKLY ON THAT WHAT IF BOTH PARTIES. ONLY IF AS OPPOSED TO. OKAY THIS IS A QUICK FOLLOW UP IS I MEAN JUST WITH REGARD TO AS YOU WERE SAYING WHAT IF BOTH PARTIES WANT TO HAVE THE DEPOSITION REPORTER PRESENT. WITH THE DEPONENT. SO THAT AND I THINK THE REASON YOU WOULD BE HEY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT- REPORTER IS GOING TO HEAR EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE IN THE ROOM TO HEAR EVERYTHING AND MAYBE THERE. TO AVOID THE PROBLEM OF SOMETIMES REMOTELY MAYBE SOME BECOMES INAUDIBLE OR- AND MAYBE DOESN'T GET RECORDED PROPERLY. IF BOTH PARTIES WANT TO HAVE THAT BUT WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE DEPONENT TO SAY WELL NO I DON'T WANT THAT. ZACH POSE A PROBLEM AS IT IS THAT'S BEEN MIKE RIGHT KIND OF HITS IT'S NOT UP TO THE DIPLOMA. SO FOR EXAMPLE IS AN ATTORNEY WHEN YOU NOTICE THE DEPOSITION. IT'S WITHIN YOUR CONTROL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE COURT REPORTER IS GOING TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT OR NOT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO THE COURT REPORTER PHYSICALLY PRESENT. AND YOUR RECORD IS NOT WHAT YOU WISH IT TO BE THEN YOU TAKE THAT RISK- SO- WHAT TAUGHT IN THE LANGUAGES SAYS THAT THE ELECTION OF THE DEPONENT FOR THE DEPOSING PARTY. THE DEPOSITION OFFICER MAY ATTEND THE DEPOSITION AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION. SHOULD I READ THAT IS SAYING THE DEPONENT. EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT OF TO THE K. IN MY JUST BE A WITNESS THAT THE WERE DEPOSING. THAT DEPONENT COULD SAY NO I DON'T WANT THEM PRESENT YEAH NO NO NO THE DEPONENT IF. WE WILL CERTAINLY CLARIFY IF THAT'S THE WAY IT READS BUT THE IF I'M THE ATTORNEY NOTICING THE DEPOSITION I NOTICED A DEPOSITION OF. A PERSON. THEN I'D I NOTICED THAT I RANGE OF THE CORE REPORT IF THE DEPONENT SAYS I DON'T WANT THE COURT REPORTER BE PRESENT. THEY HAVE NO OPTION AND IF AND IF THERE'S ANY AMBIGUITY WILL CLEAR THAT UP THAT THE PERSON WHO NOTICES THE DEPOSITION. MAKES THE TERMINATION- AT LEAST INITIALLY AND CLEARLY IF THE PERSON WHO IS DEFENDING THE DEPOSITION WHICH THE COURT REPORTER PRESENT. THEY THEY CAN ALSO THEY GET TO COURT REPORTERS THERE IF THEY LIKE ONE REMOTELY AND ONE PHYSICALLY PRESENT. YEAH THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO CLARIFY AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S YOUR INTENT SO. AS IF THERE IS AN AMBIGUITY OTHER ONE WE WILL WE WILL- EXAMINE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE DEPONENT CAN'T PRECLUDE A COURT REPORTER FROM BEING PHYSICALLY PRESENT. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SIGNALED SENDIRI MIKLOS ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS- AMENDED. AND I WILL NOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS SECOND.

TO DIAL THAT NUMBER AND WE WILL START WITH THE OPENING FROM CENTER BY CASKEY THINKING MISTER CHEER AND COLLEAGUES ONE THE GREATEST HURDLES- FAMILIES FACE WHEN CONTEMPLATING WHETHER TO PURSUE A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION IS THE SKYROCKETING COSTS OF ATTENDING COLLEGE DESPITE THESE TROUBLING TRENDS MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES CONTINUE TO SEE VALUE IN A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN THE SAVINGS PLAN SUCH AS THE SCHOLAR SHEER FIVE TWO NINE ACCOUNT PROVIDE FAMILIES OF ALL INCOME LEVELS WITH THAT THE FIRST SET OF INVESTMENT OPTIONS WHEN. USED FOR QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES I THINK THE STAFF REPORT DOES A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING UP AT AT ALL INCOME LEVELS PEOPLE THAT SET UP THESE PLANS ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE THEIR KIDS TO ATTEND COLLEGE HOWEVER FROM ACCOUNT OWNERS FACED WITH THE JUDGMENT THE CREDITOR HAS THE ABILITY TO ATTACH THE ACCOUNT TO SATISFY THEIR JUDGMENT CALIFORNIA IS JUST ONE OF TWENTY TWO STATES WITHOUT STATE CREDITOR PROTECTION FOR FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS. PLAN SO THIS BILL EXPANDS LIST OF JUDGMENT EXEMPTIONS- ON THE CALIFORNIA BANKRUPTCY LAW IN ORDER TO INCLUDE FAMILY SAVINGS AND THE SCHOLARS SHARE ACCOUNT DOES THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FAMILY COLLEGE SAVINGS ARE PROTECTED UNDER A- UNDER AGAINST JUDGMENTS I'M I'VE TAKEN RECENT AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT THE EXEMPTION TO FIFTEEN AT THE FOR EACH OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS THE ILLINOIS. MODEL BEFORE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY IN THE MONEY MUST BE AN ACCOUNT FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE BANK BANKRUPTCY COULD BE COMPLETELY EXEMPTED AND FINALLY A STAFF REPORT NOTES OUT THE BILL REVISES THE STATUTES- A SETTING.

FEDERAL LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FAMILIES TO SEEK FEDERAL PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS DURING BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY TWENTY TWO STATE WITHOUT THE CREDITOR PROTECTION OUTSIDE OF BANKRUPTCY. FOR FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT THE ACCOUNT OWNER IT START WITH THE JUDGEMENT. CREDITOR HAS THE ABILITY TO ATTACH THE ACCOUNT TO SATISFY THEIR JUDGMENT THE RESULT THAT CAN BE VERY DEVASTATED A FAMILY MEMBER THAT THEIR LOVED ONE. IS ESPECIALLY- JUST BECAUSE THE CHILD IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE ACCOUNTIN ANY FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND CAN CONTRIBUTE.

BUT HE IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME SIR. OKAY THANK YOU SO AFRAID TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE LINES FOR SB EIGHT NINETY EIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS RIVER NORTH E. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN VERY PURSER- THAT YOU'VE. THAT YOU'VE PERSEVERED THROUGH A LOT I COMPLETELY WITH YOU THE- MY SET ASIDE CHILD SHOULD NOT BE SHOULD NOT BE- PART OF A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING- YOU KNOW THE ISSUE THAT OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IS HOW TO PUT AN EXCLUSION LIKE THAT INTO STATE LAW WITHOUT- INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO HIDE ASSETS FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IN THIS WAY AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE- YOU'VE BEEN VERY DILIGENT WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. SO YOU'VE NOW TIED TO THE EXCLUSION TO THE ANNUAL GIFT TAX EXCLUSION WHICH AS YOU SAY IS ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IS THAT EXCLUSION PER FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT OR IS IT EXCLUSION TOTAL. FOR THE PARTY ENTERING IN THE BANKRUPTCY. THROUGH THE CHAIR. PER FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT. OKAY SO WHAT IS TO PREVENT SOMEONE WHO- HAD THE DISHONEST MOTIVE OF TRYING TO SHIELD ASSETS FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS WHAT IS TO PREVENT THEM FROM. BUT IN MANY FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON WHO YOU CAN OPEN ACCOUNT FOR YOU CAN DO IT FRIENDS NEIGHBORS THE GUY DOWN THE STREET AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT THEIR INFORMATION YOU CAN OPEN A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT FOR THEM. SO WHY COULDN'T A BORROWER JUST OPEN MANY FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT TO PUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND EACH ONE. BOTH THROUGH THEIR- FIRST YOU'RE A RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS THAT YOU HAVE A FOUR OH ONE K. OR- OF. THE RETIREMENT. SO FOR ALL THROUGH YOUR- THERE'S AND THEN. AMOUNT OF. OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN PUT IN THEIR TAX EXEMPT WITHOUT. WITHOUT LOOK IT JUST HAS TO BE A REASONABLE. AMOUNT FOR YOUR LIFE'S RETIREMENT. THE SECOND- MEASURES THAT WE HAVE THE- WILL RULE AGAINST FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES ANY BANKRUPTCY COURT. TRUSTEE IS ABLE TO GO BACK FOR YEARS. AND FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES THAT WOULD BE MADE BY SOMEBODY SO. EITHER THE- FACT THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT THERE'S A SCHEME TO. DEFRAUD YOUR CREDITORS AND THAT THOSE TOOLS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO- THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEES IN THE ESTATE. IF THEY WERE GOING ON SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT. A CHAPTER SEVEN TRUSTEE AND WOULD LOVE TO GOAL. AFTER SOMEBODY THAT PROJECT WE DID THAT. IN AGAIN MEMBER THESE. POST BE SPENT. AS A- TRUSTEE THE- TREASURES OFFICES JUST LIKE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND THE COUNCIL THAT. TEN THOUSAND BUCKS IN OF RIGHT NOW. SORT OF WHAT THE WORLD. WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE WITH THAT SO. I THINK THAT IN THE- UNDER. TO SOMEBODY DID THAT. THE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE. POWERS THAT THE TRUSTEES HAVE RIGHT NOW. OKAY I MEAN I KNOW WHY. IF WE AGREE THAT. ACTIONS LIKE THE ONE I DESCRIBED WILL BEFRAUDULENT THAT WE COULDN'T JUST SAY THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE PUT THIS IN THE STATUTE WELL IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S IT MARKS UP THE EXEMPTIONS WE NORMALLY JUST SAY THESE ARE THE EXCEPTIONS THAT THE SECTIONS UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY. CODE ENTERED THE FIVE HUNDRED SECTIONS GIVE ALL THESE POWERS TO THE TRUSTEE TO DO THINGS AND THOSE WITH THAT'S A THAT'S A FEDERAL ENTITLED FEDERAL LAW THAT THEY HAVE FOR POWERS THAT THEY HAVE PLUS THE STATE INTERPRETATION SO IT WOULD BE IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT SECTIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST GAVE STATES THE RIGHTS IS JUST THE DEAL WITH THE EXEMPTION MEASURE NOT THE- DAD AFTER INTENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT. CODE SECTION OKAY WE'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE- IN THE ANSWER MIGHT BE THE SAME I'M THINKING. BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTSSOMEONE FROM CHANGING THE BENEFICIARY OF A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN AFTER IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED SO. IN THEORY A BAD ACTOR COULD ESTABLISH MANY DIFFERENT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS- DECLARE BANKRUPTCY GO THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND THEN CONSOLIDATE THEM BACK INTO A SINGLE BENEFICIARY. BUT WITH WOULD THAT BE LEGAL THE DEPARTMENT OF AVOIDING. I WOULD. THREE CHAIR PERSONALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IS STILL THERE ARE A LOT ON THESE FIVE TWENTY NINE THEY HAVE TO BE SPENT ON A- ON THAT THE EDUCATION PLAN FIRST FOR SOME FOR SOMEBODY- WE'RE AS OTHER ASSETS LIKE A FOUR OH ONE K. WOULD BE IS. TOTALLY ACCEPT ME YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR LIFE EXPENSE EXPECTANCY AT. SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY WHENEVER YOU'RE RETIRED YOU CAN HAVE SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN A FOUR OH ONE K. THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY CODE RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T KNOW WHY SOMEBODY WOULD SAY LET'S. LET'S JONES THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS IT IN IT THAT HAVE LIMITATIONS ON HOW I CAN PULL UP THE MONEY IF. IF THE GOAL WAS TO FRAUDULENT LEE PROTECT ASSETS. AGAINST CREDITORS IN AGAINST THE STATE OKAY WELL WHEN ONE FINAL QUESTION ON ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC. BUT WHY DID YOU ONLY EXEMPTS FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS THAT WERE OPEN THROUGH SCHOLARSHIP. I KNOW MANY CALIFORNIANS HOLD FIVE TWENTY ON PLANS THAT ARE OPEN UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER STATES. BECAUSE THERE'S NO FOR. ADVANTAGE TO USING SCHOLAR SHARE SO WHY WOULD YOU NOT JUST MAKE A GENERIC GENERICALLY APPLY TO ALL FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANTS. DO CHAIR. BUT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE- THOSE ACCOUNTS OF P. PEOPLE ARE FREE TO BUY THOSE OTHER ACCOUNTS THIS IS THE ONE ACCOUNT THAT CALIFORNIA CONTROL SAID THAT THE- TREASURE RUNS AND QUITE FRANKLY WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM I MEAN IT'S THERE'S I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH THIS IS PROTECTED FROM LIQUIDATION IN THE BANKRUPTCY VERSUS THE INDIANA ACCOUNT FOR THE I GUESS THE ILLINOIS ACCOUNT WOULD BE IN THE SAME SAME AMOUNT SO. WE'RE WE'RE CHOOSING THE ONE THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER AT LEAST TREASURE HAS CONTROL OF TO- TO GIVE THIS EXEMPTION OF. MY FOLLOW YOUR YOUR THOUGHT YOU'RE SAYING WHY WOULD YOU JUST ACCEPT EVERY. EVERY FIVE TWENTY NINE- CULTURE PROGRAM AND AGAIN THE OF THE IDEAS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL THAT WE'D BE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RETIREMENT FROM SERVICE WORK pSTATE BANKRUPTCY LAW SO I MEAN IF WE CHOSE TO. EXEMPT ASSETS IN ALL THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS TO REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE CHARTERED WE COULD YEAH BUT- I MEAN AS YOU SAY. MAYBE WE WANT TO AND INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO OPEN THEM pHELP ALL THE PARENTS THEY ALREADY HAD FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS OF RICHARD ELSEWHERE. SO I MEAN I GUESS I RECOGNIZE IT WILL TAKE THE COMMITTEES TIME OUT IT'S HI I'M SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO A LITTLE TROUBLED BY THE PATH THAT YOU'VE TAKEN. THE I WISH THAT THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMITATION- PER YEAR JUST FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS COULD HAVE BEEN IN TOTAL. NOT A PER ACCOUNT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND I WISH THAT YOU EXIT ALL FIVE ONE PLANTS NOT JUST FOR SURE. ONCE THANK YOU MISTER. TO CHAIR ITS- IT'S ALWAYS GOOD. FOR ME HERE IN. FOR ME TAKES. MY LAW. UP PRINT NORMALLY I. ASKED TO KIND. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE I'M NOT. PREPARED TO DO THAT WITH THIS BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL AND- I'M SURE I'LL BE COMING BACK WITH SOME OTHER EXEMPTION- OF PROGRAMS AND- IDEAS AND I'LL- KEEP THAT IN MIND IT WOULD BE UNUSUAL HERE IF YOU DID. WITH THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS COME. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE HIGHER CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. SO I AM LOOKING FOR- A MOTION AND A SECOND.

SO WE WILL START WITH THE AUTHOR'S STATEMENT MISERIES THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS UP FOR US YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WIENER. WITH THE RECENT POLICE KILLINGS OF GEORGE FLOORED AND BRIANNA TAYLOR THE HORRIFIC COBIT NINETEEN. OUTBREAK AT CENTER SAN QUENTIN AND THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT RACISM IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SB FIVE NINE TWO IS MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER. WE NEED TO REMAKE OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM THE GROUND UP. FROM POLICING TO OUR COURTS AND THE SYSTEM OF MASS INCARCERATIONS. SB FIVE NINE TWO IS ONE IMPORTANT PIECE OF TIS PUZZLE. SB FIVE NINE TWO BY SENATORS CENTER WIENER EXPANSES SOURCES A PROSPECTIVE JURORS TO INCLUDE STATE TAX FILERS TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE JURY POOL. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN ONLY FUNCTION PROPERLY WHEN IT UPHOLDS THE BASIC RIGHT THE DEFENDANTS MUST BE TRIED BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS. WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY THAT IS A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF OUR DIVERSE CITY. BUT MAY FALL SHORT BECAUSE JURY POOLS GENERATED BY DMV RECORDS AND REGISTRAR OF VOTERS IS MORE AFFLUENT AND LESS DIVERSE THAN CALIFORNIA'S DEMOGRAPHICS. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR USING THESE TWO LISTS IS NOT BASED ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THEY EXCLUDE LARGE SWATHS OF OUR POPULATION MAINLY RACIAL MINORITIES. NOT ONLY DOES THIS EXCLUSION RESULT IN RACIAL IN CALIFORNIA'S JURY POOLS. IT ALSO DEPRIVES CALIFORNIA COURTS OF THOUSANDS OF PROSPECTIVE JURORS. MIKE SPENT EXPANDING THE REQUIRED SOURCES OF PROSPECTIVE JURORS TO INCLUDE THE LIST OF STATE TAX FILERS SB FIVE NINE TWO WILL ALLOW JURIES TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE. WELL JURIES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY CAN ONLY SPEAK WITH THE VOICE OF IT AND THE FORTY OF THE COMMUNITY IF THEY TRULY AND ACCURATELY REFLECT THAT COMMUNITY. SB FIVE NINE TWO IS OVERDUE AT THE COMMONSENSE REFORM THAT ADVANCES FAIRNESS DIVERSITY AND LEGITIMACY IN CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR S. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND AND A SECOND THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT OSCAR PO BROWN FROM THE SOLANO COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE ARE YOU ON THE LINE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY GOOD POLICE RECEIVED UP GOOD AFTERNOON. OKAY GO. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM OSCAR BARBARO I AM A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND CHIEF DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SOLANO COUNTY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION PROUDLY SUPPORTS AND SPONSORS SB FIVE NINETY TWO AND APPLAUD SENATOR WIENER FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS AN INHERENT AND SYSTEMATIC IMBALANCE OF THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF OUR STATE'S JURY POOL. BY ADDING THE LIST OF STATE TAX FILERS TO THOSE WHO ARE SUMMONED TO JURY SERVICE OUR STATE CHALLENGED THIRTY THREE OTHER STATES IN THIS NATION THAT USE A DUPLICITY IN ADDITION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND VOTER REGISTRATION. ASSEMBLY JURORS AND FOURTEEN OTHER STATES THAT SPECIFICALLY USED STATE TAX RULES AS ONE OF THE LISTA SOME INJURES. FOR THE LAST DECADES WITNESSED CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL TO IS JUST. PROSECUTED OUR COURTS MEMBERS OF OUR BLACK AND LATINO. POPULATIONS OF OUR STATE RELATIVE TO THEIR NUMBERS IN THE POPULATION. HOWEVER WHAT IS NOT THE ADDRESS IN OUR SYSTEM IS THAT WE ARE SELECTING JURORS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF OUR CLIENTS. OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THE REVERSE SCENARIO EXISTS. THERE ARE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF CAUCASIAN CITIZENS THAT APPEAR IN CHIU TERRY PULLS RELATIVE TO THEIR NUMBERS IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE CASES ARE PROSECUTED AND THE SIGNIFICANT UNDER REPRESENTATION. OF BLACK AND LATINO CITIZENS IN THESE POOLS. RIGHT DECADES OF THIS PHENOMENON BEING THIS THAT LIST CHALLENGE IN OUR TRIAL APPELLATE COURTS THE SITUATION REMAINS THE SAME. DUE TO THE SYSTEMATIC EXCLUSION OF MINORITY POPULATIONS THAT RESERVE HOLD FROM USING ONLY THOSE TWO LISTS. BECAUSE COURTS HAVE BEEN HELD THAT THESE LIST OF THEMSELVES ARE QUOTE. NEUTRAL HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT THE IMPACT OF USING THESE LIST TO ANYTHING BUT- THE ON THE IMPACT. TOOLS IN THERE IS THE UNDER. OF MINORITY POPULATIONS. IN OUR JURY POOLS IS. IN LIGHT OF THE DEAD JUST IMPACT OF THE KORAN VIRUSES HAS HAD ON MINORITY IN THIS. THIS BUDGET WILL HER HELP CORRECT GOING FORWARD TO RACE IN BATTLE OF OUR TO RIPPLES BY ALLOW KERRY COME TO SOMEONE FROM ACT LIST OF STATE TAX FILERS SUPPORTER DONE YEARLY AND CONTRASTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES- AND- WISHARD DONE EVERY FIVE YEARS AND VOLUNTARY VOTER REGISTRATION WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED TO BRING RENEWED AT ALL. GIVEN THAT MINORITY RESIDENTS WHO ARE TENDING TO BE MORE TRANSITORY IN THEIR LIVING PATTERNS AS MANY AS YOUR PRIOR HEARINGS. TODAY HAVE ESTABLISHED. THE CAUSE OF A THE COST TO JERK. IN MAILING. IS HOUSEHOLDS WHILE PEOPLE ARE KNOWN LONGER RESIDING ARE SUBSTANTIAL THE USE OF STATE TAX FILERS IN PROVIDING MORE ACCURATE LIST WILL. CAUSE THE JURY COMMISSIONERS COSTS TO BE REDUCED DRAMATICALLY AND THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN BY STUDIES IN THE STATE IN NEW YORK IN THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM. AND THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AND THE COUNCIL OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE COURT SUPPORT. ADDING STATE TAX FILERS AS A WAY TO BROADEN THE BASE OF JURORS TO PROVIDE A MORE REPRESENTATIVE. SAMPLE THE TWO IN THIS LED WILL HELP CORRECTIVE PROSPERITY AND THE DEPRIVATION OF JUSTICE THAT RESULTS FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM BY INCLUDING MORE CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS IN THE JURY PROCESS AND PRE LIFE IN THE CLASS. PROTECT OF BEING TRIED BY A JURY OF ONE'S PEERS ONCE PEERS FROM A REPRESENTATIVE CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY. FINALLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT PIECE OF TAPE STATE TAX FILERS MAY RESULT IN MORE NONCITIZENS BEING SUMMONED FOR SERVICE. HOWEVER AS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW EVERY CALIFORNIA JURY SUMMONS STATES THAT IF YOU WERE SUMMONED AND YOU ARE NOT A U. S. CITIZEN YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED FROM JURY SERVICE AND YOU CAN NOTIFY THE JURY COMMISSIONER OF THAT WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO GO TO THE COURTHOUSE. AND THERE'S ALSO NO CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR IDENTIFICATION CARD AND THOSE ARE THE LISTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. USED SOME INSURERS. SO YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S TRIED OVER TWO HUNDRED TRIALS IN THE STATE I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU HOW DISHEARTENING IT IS TO TURN TO A CLIENT WHO YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO HELP INSURE. GETS A FAIR TRIAL AND WHO IS ENTITLED TO HAVE A JURY OF ONE'S PEERS PROTECTED. AND THEN TO WATCH THE PANEL SUMMONED OF JUROR PANEL THAT'S SUMMONED. TO TRY THE CASE COME INTO A COURTROOM AND ALMOST NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME RACES AS I. CALIFORNIA CODE. ASSOCIATION URGES. FOR THIS LONG OVERDUE CHANGE TORTURE SYSTEM.
