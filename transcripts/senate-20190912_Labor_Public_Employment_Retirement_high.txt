INTERMITTENTLY LAWTON I APPRECIATE THE CITY COUNT THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN BOB THIS FORWARD IN APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION AND CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT THIS BILL IN EFFECT WILL DO. I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD SAID THE NAME WAS REFERENCE LAB INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION AND IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE- HUNDREDS OF MY OWN DISTRICT ANOTHER SINCE HIS WHAT I'LL- WEEKLIES IN SMALL PAPERS THE ETHNIC PRESS. ON THE VERY US WEEKLY'S. THAT MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS MANY. AW MONOLINGUAL CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO RELY ON THE PAPERS FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION. IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY ACCESS TO INFORMATION WAYS IN WHICH THEY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. INFORMATION THAT WE RELY ON THIS PUBLIC SERVANTS TO KEEP OUR FINGER ON THE PULSE OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND EMERGING IN. PLEASE COMMUNITIES AS WELL ARM WHILE APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL HAS CAST THE A BROAD NET IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE PUBLICATIONS WHO WILL HAVE BE GIVEN THIS ONE YEAR. REPRIEVE IF YOU WEAR. I DO HOPE THAT ALL THE NEWSPAPERS USE THIS TIME WISELY TO REALLY FIGURE OUT A WAY IN WHICH THE SMALL WEEKLIES CAN CONTINUE TO BE VIABLE SINCE THEY ALREADY OPERATE ON A VERY THIN MARGIN. AND WAYS IN WHICH WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR LARGELY ARE NO LONGER SUBJECTED TO THE KIND OF WORK CONDITIONS THEY DO. THIS IS A CHALLENGING SCENARIO I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION AND YOUR PREFERENCE TO NOT HAVE TO CARVE THEM OUT BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH I'M ATTEMPTING TO REPRESENT AND ADVOCATE FOR IN THIS CONVERSATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CUT OFF. COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND CUT OFF VERTICALLY IN THIS TIME NATIONALLY THAT ARE CUT OFF. INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE VIABLE COMMUNITIES. FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTED AB ONE SEVENTY TODAY REALLY THANK YOU SENATOR JEFF HILL AYE I ALSO THINK. THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT A SMALL PAPERS THE LOCAL PAPER SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OTHERWISE. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW I MEAN THEY ARE THAT CRITICAL I THINK IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT I ALSO THINK THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. IS OF RIGHT NOW IN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WHILE I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM TRY TO. RECOVER OR TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THE BACKS OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE WHICH ARE AS YOU INDICATE THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A FREE PRESS. AND MANY PAPERS LARGE AS WELL AS SMALL ARE. SUFFERING RIGHT NOW IN OUR THREATENED BY THE INTERNET. BUT I DO THINK THAT MOST OF OUR PAPERS HAVE ENORMOUS VALUE. BIGGER PAPERS THAT THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU WITH THE NEWS NOT PROPAGANDA AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING WE NEED TO FACTOR IN. THAT BEING SAID I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY IT IS. I RECALL AS A KID AND THEN EVEN MY OWN GRANDKIDS WHO. DO PAPER ROUTES AND END UP HAVING TO COLLECT THE MONEY. OF FROM THE FOLKS TO WHOM THEY DELIVER PAPERS A FIVE IN THE MORNING. OR ELSE THEY HAVE TO FUND THE- THEY HAVE TO PAY THE COMPANY ITSELF. IN OTHER WORDS THAT THEY ARE SO INDEPENDENT THAT THEY HAVE TO COLLECT. FROM THE READER OR ELSE THEY HAVE TO PAY IN THE FEW PENNIES AND NICKELS THAT THEY HAVE MADE. IN THOSE PAPER ROUTES AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMSELVES I HOPE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE TO THAT SEEMS SO INHERENTLY. UNFAIR SO I THINK THERE IS SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. OVER THE NEXT YEAR I WANT TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS CRITICAL AND MARK SEE. A SMALL PAPERS ARE CRITICAL TO THE WELL BEING OF COMMUNITIES. BRENT THE THIRD CHALLENGED MONEY IN TODAY'S WORLD BUT- HOPEFULLY. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT NOT ON THE BACKS OF THE- OF THE SMALLEST THOSE WHO MAKE THE LEAST AND WHO. FIVE IN THE MORNING IS HARD FOR ANYBODY LET ALONE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE. TRYING TO JUST MAKE ENDS MEET SO WITH THAT I WILL ALSO SUPPORT THIS THE VEGAS INTERJECTION. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS CONCERNS NAY THIS QUESTION FOR NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS. SO AND WE HAVE A- BASICALLY I GUESS REPRIEVES NOT THE RIGHT WORD WE HAVE A ONE YEAR CONTINUATION THE CURRENT SITUATION. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT YOU KNOW. YOU COULD COME BACK HERE AND MAKE MANY SAME ARGUMENTS AND SAY WE NEED MORE TIME SO CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO WHAT KIND OF STOPS. THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO TAKE IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT WE'RE NOT BACK HERE AGAIN HAVING OUT BECAUSE THAT I MEAN. IT'S A ONE YEAR RIGHT. LOTS OF OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE COME AND SAID WE NEED TRANSITION TIME TO SO. BUT YEAH DYNAMICS WAS DECISION THAT WAS RAY MADE SO THAT'S EXISTENCE AND- NOW SPRING COURT IS RULED THIS BILL ACTUALLY TO ROLL BACK IN MANY WAYS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MAYBE NOT AS FAR SOME PEOPLE WANT BUT IT IS SO. WHAT IS IT. THAT THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ARE GOING TO DO SO THAT WE'RE NOT BACK HERE A YEAR. LATER WITH THEIR REQUEST WE NEED MORE TIME. WELL TO ASK TRUTH SENATOR OF. A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN AMONG OME OF MY INDUSTRY FOLKS GEARING UP TOWARD TRYING TO COMPLY WITH AB FIVE AND WE DID LEARN THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS DELAY UNTIL JUST RECENTLY THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL BE HAD AND I KNOW THERE IS EARNESTNESS ON THE PART OF THE PUBLISHERS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY WITHIN THEIR MEANS. ON TO GET SOMETHING DONE BUT AS FOR NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S ANY PLAN IN PLACE PER SE JUST GOOD FAITH THAT WERE WE'RE GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN HERE SO I'M I'M AND IS THAT I'M I'M GONNA ASSUME WE SAY GOOD FIT AND I BELIEVE YOU DID SAY THAT. THERE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BUS HERE. TO FOR MORE TIME. BY A I ASSUME THAT'S THE CASE YES OKAY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. VERY TO US YES SENATOR MITCHELL SORRY I WOULD JUST WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO ONE DOCTOR PANTS POINT WHETHER THERE'S A REQUEST OR NOT I KNOW THAT I WILL NOT BE AN ADVOCATE AT THE TABLE PROMOTING ADDITIONAL TIME I'D I STEPPED UP AND OUT. THIS TIME BASED ON THE CONCERNS I EXPRESS TO GIVE THE EXTRA TIME AND SO A YEAR IS THE YEAR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SO I HOPE THE TIME IS USED WILL DEFINITELY. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL SAID SENATOR MORAN IS NOT EXCUSE ME AND- EXPRESSED I WILL BE AN ADVOCATE FOR. EXTENDING OUT FURTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MORAL IN SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT YOU KNOW IT AND IT HAS BEEN SAID AND I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO. THE LITTLE COMPROMISE HERE ON THAT ONE YEAR I THINK THE- INDUSTRY IS GOING TO PUT THEIR BEST EFFORT INTO A SOLUTION HERE THEY HAVE TO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL BE AN EXTENSION AND- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL THAT WE MAINTAIN. THE VIABILITY OF THE PRINTED PRESS AS WE LOOK AT IN SENATOR MITCHELL MADE THE COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED THAT COMMUNITY ACCESS WE NEED TO. TO BE INVOLVED IN ALLOW OUR COMMUNITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND TO US ON THEIR THEIR DESIRES AND THEIR NEED TO NEW WE DON'T WANT. THEM TO ONLY RELY ON THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELEVISION NEWS FOR THEIR THEIR COVERAGE AND THE- EXTENT OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE ON HOW. THE SYSTEM IS IN OUR COUNTRY'S GOING INTO AYE. THE PUBLISHERS RECORD IS THAT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SOLUTION. SOMETIME DURING THIS YEAR THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM AND WORK FOR ALL OF US AS WELL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO WORK. ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID THIS ISN'T A HEARTBREAKING FOR ME BECAUSE THE DYNAMICS DECISION. WAS AIMED AT. THIS TYPE OF A. B. THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY FOR GENERATIONS ALTHOUGH THEY NO LONGER REQUIRE YOU TO CUT YOUR OWN MONEY. THAT'S HOW IT WAS WHEN I WAS A GIRL. HAVE BEEN MISSED FIND WORKERS THEY HAVE FACED COUNTLESS LAWSUITS UNDER DINA ARE UNDER BROWN LOW AND HAVE LOS THOSE. THEY. WILL CONTINUE TO FACE LAWSUIT. I WAS HEARTBROKEN FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PENDING LAWSUITS AND NOW I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING WHY WE COULDN'T MAKE THIS EXEMPTION JUST FOR THE SMALL WEEKLIES AND BASED ON CIRCULATION NUMBERS BECAUSE OUR LARGEST NEWSPAPERS ARE IN FACT CURRENTLY FACING CLAIMS. WHICH WELL AT THE BEST BE JUSTICE DELAYED PROBABLY JUSTICE DENIED BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUE UNDER DYNAMAX BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN. THEY WILL BE EXEMPTED FROM THOSE CLAIMS ARE ONCE EVEN AB FIVE APPLIES FROM THE CLAIMS BETWEEN THE TIME OF DYNAMAX. AND WHEN THEY MUST COMPLY. THE UP A POINT THAT OUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WHEN WE DO BILLS TO A SOMETIMES AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME IN PEACE LEGISLATION I'VE HAD TO SWALLOW HARD AND EXEMPTS PEOPLE WHO I FEEL LIKE ARE AT TE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE REASON BESIDES THE FACT THAT OF. THE ENTIRE NEW SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA WEAPONIZE THEIR EDITORIAL PAGE AGAINST THIS BILL BASED ONLY ON NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND- IT'S A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL. BUT NAY END AB FIVE WILL COVER A MILLION WORKERS WHO NEED THEIR PROTECTION. AND SO I'M WILLING TO CARRY THIS BILL AT THAT FOR THE RECORD WANT TO POINT OUT IT IS A- WITH A HEAVY HEART. AND NOT SOMETHING THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF. MY RECORD IN THIS LEGISLATURE SAMPLE WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLOTHES ENTERTAIN A MOTION. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL WE HAVE A MOTION TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BE CONCURRED IN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR HILL AYE HILL AYE WORLD I. THANK JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL.
