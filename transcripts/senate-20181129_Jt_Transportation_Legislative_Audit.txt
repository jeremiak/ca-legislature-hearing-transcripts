THIS MORNING WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR AND HER RECENT OUR REPORT. RELEASED ON THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WANT TO THANK SENATOR BELL. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARAMBULA AND PATTERSON FOUR REQUESTING THIS AUDIT ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. FOR ARE REQUESTING TODAY'S HEARING. TODAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. I ALONG WITH THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. INITIALLY SUPPORTED THE DREAM. OF OUR GREAT STATE BUILDING THE NATION'S FIRST BILL BULLET TRAIN. WE'LL BE PASSED PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HOWEVER MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE BECOME. INCREASINGLY DISILLUSIONED. AFTER THE DREAM OF THE CALIFORNIA BALL THE TRAIN. HAS BECOME A NIGHTMARE OF COST OVERRUNS AND PROJECT DELAYS. TODAY THE LEGISLATURE WILL BEGIN ITS COMMITMENT TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT OVER THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND ITS FUTURE. SO THAT WE NOT ONLY TO CONTINUE TO INVEST RESPONSIBLY. AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND CREATE JOBS. BUT ALSO SO THAT WE IN SURE THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. TODAY THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE SEEKING ANSWERS TO MANY QUESTIONS. FOR MOST OF MY MIND WILL BE WHAT STEPS. WELL THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BE TAKING. TO REGAIN. TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THERE ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THIS PROJECT. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER. TWO THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION -- MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO REVIEW THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS AND HOW THE STATE'S HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS BEING DELIVERED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY [inaudible] IMPACT. THERE IS. ARE. IN PAST HEARINGS I RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULT TASK THE AUTHORITY HAS HAD IN BUILDING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. I READILY ADMIT I'VE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THIS PROJECT HOWEVER HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORITY IN GETTING THIS PROJECT. MOVING ALONG HENCE THE TOURS THAT I'VE TAKEN WITH THE AUTHORITY. AND CONSTRUCTION STAFF. TO SEE WHERE THEY'RE AT AFTER HIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE FOLKS THERE AND UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES ARE HAVING BUT ALSO. NO THAT WITH THEIR NOT WHERE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE. UNFORTUNATELY HE'S LOT OF RESULTS ARE MAKING ME QUESTION MY FAITH IN. THAT MY FAITH HAS BEEN VERY MUCH BEEN MISPLACED. THE SCOPING COST TO THE TAXPAYERS IS ONGOING SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH BASIC CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT TASKS LIKE CONTRACT OVERSIGHT MEDICAL PLANNING. ARE STAGGERING. BUT WE STILL HAVE THE CONTINUAL UNANSWERED QUESTION HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUDITOR. ABOUT THE LARGE FUNDING GAP TO GET HIGH SPEED TRAINS UP AND RUNNING AND I GOTTA TELL YOU EVERY TIME THAT I'VE HAD. A HEARING THAT INCLUDED THE STATE ARE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO THANK THIS ORDER. THIS IS BEEN A BLESSING TO THE PEOPLE OF BEING ABLE -- TO GET THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY. THERE'S THERE'S SET DATE THE SUIT SECURE FUNDING FOR PROSTATE TWELVE POINT SEVEN BILLION. BUT TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IS NEEDED JUST TO FINISH THE INITIAL OPERATING PROJECT. THERE'S A GAP THERE FOLKS. WHERE IS IT COMING FROM? DO COOLEY PHASE ONE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES WILL COST APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. LEAVING A CURRENT FUNDING GAP OF OVER SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. BY FAR THE COSTLIEST DECISION TO THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER WAS A RUSH TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION. GROUND WAS BROKEN BEFORE THE AUTHORITY EVEN KNEW OR HAD POSITION OF WHAT PARCELS OF LAND IT NEEDED AND ONE ENTITIES IT NEEDED TO NEGOTIATE WITH IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I'VE LIKE IN THIS TO BUILDING THE AIRPLANE ON THE RUNWAY [inaudible] MANY TIMES. THE AUTHORITY IS SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION QUICKLY IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE THREE POINT BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. UNFORTUNATELY. THE HAZE HAS RESULTED IN A DOMINO EFFECT OF COST OVERRUNS ESTIMATED TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO FAR. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT ANY GAINS CALIFORNIA RECEIVE BY STARTING EARLY. WILL BE ENTIRELY WIPED OUT. WASTE OF ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS. I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT ONCE AGAIN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN FLAG AS AN ISSUE AT THE AUTHORITY. DAUGHTER POINTED UP CONTACT OVERSIGHT DEFICIENCIES A TOOTH TWENTY TWELVE WHAT IT WILL LOOK AND ACT PASSED THE AUDITOR IF THIS IS THIS A RECURRING THEME. THE AUTHORS OF THE IF AUTHORITIES OWN INTERNAL AUDITS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALSO POINT OUT SHORTCOMINGS IN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. AND WE STILL FIND OURSELVES TODAY WITH ONGOING OVERSIGHT ISSUES. MULTIPLE TIMES THE AUTHORITY IS SEATED THAT THESE ISSUES THAT WERE BEING ADDRESSED. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS BEEN LESS THAN FORTHCOMING. WITH THIS PROCESS. I CONTINUE TO WORK ON INCREASING. ACCOUNTABILITY IN LEGISLATIVE OR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE AUTHORITY. INCLUDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER HAVING MY MOST RECENT ATTEMPT VETOED. I WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TO PUSH FOR INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND OPENNESS. AT THIS AUTHORITY. I LOOK FOR TODAY'S HEARING IN TODAY'S TESTIMONY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH OF CHAIRMAN MURATSUCHI FOR DOING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ACTED LIKE TO NOW TURN IT OVER -- TO INVITE -- THE SATYR FREIGHT -- SUMMER BELL. THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WHEN AT THE REQUEST OF THIS ON MY STATEMENT WILL BE VERY BRIEF -- THE AUDIT -- IS HELPFUL AND REINFORCING PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED ISSUES THAT in two issues highlighted in that report so the auditor's findings indicate that these issues continue to be on going and -- we want some answers from our high speed rail authority the the legislature's along with the current and new in ministration need to work in partner Sir partnership to determine what's next for the high speed rail authority this year I offered -- the bill SB eleven seventy two that were removed many of the duplicate measures there because the latest in the authorities property acquisition process the bill was signed into law by governor brown and will say the state time and money but this is not -- the only thing we need to do is be eleven seventy two is just the start this coming March my committee will be holding an oversight hearing to provide the authority the opportunity to report back on our progress and they have made relative to these auditor's findings and and completion of the business plan this will be part of hearing of for the authorities see this project development on time and on budget schedule changes and we need to make them now thank you thank you very much next I'd like to invite to assembly member Patterson as a co request through the audit Mister chairman thank you -- I would have to be pretty blunt this audit has demonstrated to the state of California what many of us have been concerned about for years now central California is the Canary in the coal mine it is the Guinea pig and all of this and to date we have spent billions of dollars putting up concrete that's gonna run a rump rail road between just outside Madera just outside Bakersfield this audit along with other efforts to get to the facts and the truth that demonstrate that this project is in fact collapsing the last business plan came out a going out of business plan fact there's no money to complete this fact you can't get the disparate sections connected fact the audit has confirmed what many of us were concerned about with respect to the rush to put money out when they did not have property they did not have a plan with respect to the location and relocation of utilities and this what it says it was their fault that they knew it going in and they made a calculated decision to do it and to not tell anybody and until there were a lot of concerns raised and until a new executive director Mister Kelly was put in place we finally saw a business plan that at least admitted to those facts now that that's yesterday okay what's coming tomorrow there is a federal law that going on right now it started in April and that federal audit in part is going to look at the mission use of those funds early on putting out billions of dollars knowing full well they did not have to property nor plans to get the utilities relocated they've been caught and there's going to be huge consequence in the federal on number one you got to meet their deadline this audit says you're going to have to move from very very slow slow snail pace to warp speed in four years just to meet the deadline you fail to meet the deadline or the audit confirms that that billions of dollars were miss spent initially means that there's going to be the real potential for a multi billion dollar clawback by the federal government not that's where we are all the happy talk all the -- already rosy press releases up all of the -- aerial shots from drones over a lot of concrete in the air around central California is not reality reality is embedded in this audit and as we proceed I wanna dealt a little bit deeper into the -- because it is of what I consider to be this is borderline deceit and we're going to have to get to the bottom of it and I think the federal it's going to do that but beyond that we have a time problem here that I think cannot be met and so I think the mind my intention my intention was to to perhaps go into some more detail with respect to some of that earlier concern but I'm not going to repeat them I we all aye aye other members here have said so what I would think we need to be focusing on is what the heck is your plan be because plan nay has failed and if you don't come to terms with this this project will die of its own weight when you run out of money it's going to end and Fresno California is going to be left with a bunch of concrete in the air in a rump railroad that's not good enough thank you Mister Patterson before we proceed with that today's hearing I have a few housekeeping items to make sure that -- -- we're all clear on today's agenda of first I will be asking the state auditor and her staff to present -- summary of the audit findings and recommendations -- that -- will be -- I asked the honor to keep it to about fifteen minutes and and presentation following that so will ask for a response to the audit from the California high speed rail authority a similarly I ask that you keep it to around fifteen minutes Fong that to members of the of -- numbers up on the días will have -- some time to ask some questions and then we will -- wrap up the hearing with an opportunity for public comment is there any questions from anyone on the dies at this time say none -- state auditor how in your staff thank you for your attendance thank you Mister chairman and members for the record my name's Elaine Howell in the California state auditor to my left is Tammy was on all Tammy was the audit manager on this particular project to my right is mark Reiner the mark was the audit supervisor working with the team out in the field and and engaging in conversation discussions with the high speed rail authority what I what the way will handle this presentation is I'm gonna give very high level overview of the issues that we identified that I'll turn it over to ms Lozano who will talk about one specific issue that we talk about in the report and then Mr Reiner day I will discuss some of the other issues so as many of the members have mentioned in their opening comments this audit covered a variety of different issues that -- the joint legislative audit committee and particulates senator bail Assemblymembers Arambula and and Mister Patterson asked us to look at and that was related to cost containment contract management -- contracting with small disadvantaged disabled veteran business is looking at their sustainability policies looking at economic impacts recall at the hearing Mister around a lot particularly -- focused on that and then also asking us to look to determine whether or not there are any additional opportunities for the high speed rail authority to expedite this project to try to get it done more quickly so we have issues with all of those as some of the opening comments mentioned clearly there has been -- some cost over runs delays in the project as far as consistently and the authority having to consistently push deadlines out as you know we audited this project -- many many years ago contract management wasn't issue we identified in the very first thought it we did which was back in twenty ten we also did another audit -- in twenty twelve which was a follow up contract management was a significant problem in those audits and it continues to be a problem and that is something that really the high speed rail authority needs to focus on and one of the issues tied to that that we discussed in the audit report is there's a reliance on contractors we are not bringing in the authority is not bringing in and hiring state employees ought to be able to do some of these oversight or perform some of these oversight responsibilities why is that important because you have contractors overseeing other contractors and there could potentially be a conflict of interest there you INTEREST THERE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME STATE EMPLOYEES -- THE REASON I BRING THIS UP WE ALSO LOOKED AT THEIR RESPONSE TO THAT AND THEY AGREED AND THEY'VE AGREED IN THE PAST. WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THEY WILL -- PUT A B. C. P. N. FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE THEY EVEN GET THE FUNDING OR AT LEAST THEY'RE PURSUING THE FUNDING TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES WE THINK THAT'S FAR. TOO FOR FAR TOO LONG -- FAR TOO FAR OUT. SO -- THE AUTHORITY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT SO. COST OVERRUNS DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST TO THE AUTHORITY BUT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE REFER -- TO GAO OPINION THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ARE FEDERAL COUNTER POUT COMING APART THAT AUDITS ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF OF CONGRESS -- IN IN THAT OPINION IT MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN THE PAST WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN EITHER RECOUP FUNDS OR OFFSET FUTURE FUNDS TO A STATE AND THEY HAVE DONE THAT. ONE MINOR AMOUNT FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THEY HAVE THAT DON'T HAVE DONE THAT WITH SOME OTHER STATES SO THAT A LOOMING DEADLINE OF THE FEDERAL DEADLINE IS DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY TO THE AUTHORITY IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY WILL COMPLETE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT EVEN AT THE BOARD MEETING WHEN THEY PRESENTED THAT INFORMATION TO THE BOARD. OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER SAID WELL IT'S A VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE AND AS WE INDICATE IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM. AT WORK AT TWICE THE PACE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN SINCE THEY STARTED WORKING ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT -- THEY HAVE -- ENGAGED IN BLENDING MISSILE IS ON A WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE OFFSETS OF BLENDING. WITH RESPECT TO THAT BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY HAS ASSISTED IN IN CONTROLLING COST MR WRITER HE IS GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT CONTRACT MANAGEMENT --% AGAIN THIS IS AN AREA THAT WHERE WE WE FIND SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THE OWN THE INTERNAL AUDITOR FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THAT. POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN MORE CHANGE ORDERS -- WHICH INCREASES COSTS WHICH PUSHES OUT TIME TIME IS MONEY AS MR ARAMBULA SAID AT THE JAIL LIKE HEARING. SO THE MORE CHANGE ORDERS THE MORE. YOU'RE HAVING TO PUSH THE PROJECT OUT THE COSTS ARE GOING TO INCREASE ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE MOST COMPLEX WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS IN THE FUTURE WHERE THEY'RE CONSIDERING TUNNELING. AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO ANY KIND OF BLENDING OR ANY OFFSETTING SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT THE THE COST OF THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS GOING TO ESCALATE EVEN MORE THAN IT HAS. TO DATE -- COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER AGAIN SUSTAINABILITY WE ACTUALLY DID HIRE AN OUTSIDE EXPERT A LOOKED AT WHAT THE AUTHORITY A PUT TOGETHER AS FAR AS THEIR POLICIES AND AND THEY AGREED THAT THEIR POLICIES LOOK PRETTY GOOD. BUT THEY DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH RESPECT -- TO ANALYZING THE EFFECT OF CONSTRUCTION THEY'RE THEY'RE BASICALLY COMBINING EVERYTHING AND REALLY FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABILITY IN LOOKING AT A PROJECT THAT'S COMPLETE HOW MANY CARS ARE GOING TO COME OFF THE ROAD -- IF PEOPLE USE HIGH SPEED RAIL SO MR REINER YOU'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. THE LAST ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE USE OF SMALL BUSINESSES JUST DISABLED. VETERAN BUSINESSES -- THEY SAID OF PRETTY LOFTY GOAL OF THIRTY SAW IN SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE ANALYZE THAT THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT SO THERE IS. A FAIR AMOUNT OF BUSINESS THAT'S GOING TO SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED AND CERTAINLY DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS IS WHAT WE THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF THERE IS TRANSPARENCY THERE ARE SOME CONTRACTS THAT THEY HAVE EXEMPTED FROM. THAT REPORTING SO WE THINK THAT THEY JUST NEED TO TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION AND BE A BIT MORE FORTHRIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THAT. SO WE DO HAVE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS ONE KEY RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WE TALK TO CENTER BELL WHEN WE BRIEFED HIM ON THIS REPORT IS. REQUIRING THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS KEPT INFORMED OF THEIR PROGRESS PARTICULARLY WITH THIS DEADLINE. OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO RELATED TO THE FEDERAL DOLLARS -- IN THE FEDERAL GRANT THAT THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVED FOR THIS PROJECT WE HAVE ALSO HAVE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE TO THE AUTHORITY -- AND THEY HAVE IN IN MOST CASES EMBRACE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THEM AS YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP PROCESS. WHERE WE WILL EXPECT PERIODIC REPORTS TYPICALLY THAT SIXTY DAY SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR -- AS I MENTIONED TO SOME MEMBERS ONE WE BRIEF THEM ON THIS AUDIT WE CAN CERTAINLY -- INCLUDE MORE FREQUENT BRIEFING ARE MORE FREQUENT STATUS UPDATES FROM THE AUTHORITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT TIME FROM WE CAN CERTAINLY CHANGE THAT. AND THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE YOU ARE PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE AUTHORITY IS ASSERTING. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL TURN IT OVER THE MISSILES ON WHEN SHE'S GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE AUDIT REPORT RELATED. TO THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES -- AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTION I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- BLENDING THE SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY -- PLANNED A STANDALONE DEDICATE SYSTEM TO COVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILES IN CALIFORNIA. AND BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS AND BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS THE THE AUTHORITY HAD STARTED IMPLEMENTING -- THE BLENDING PROCESS -- IT FIRST IN INTRODUCED BLENDING IN ITS TWENTY TWELVE BUSINESS PLAN -- DISSECT THE SEGMENT BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE WAS THE FIRST -- SECTION TO BE BLENDED. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT ADDED A-BLENDING OF A SECOND SEGMENT BETWEEN GREAT. BURBANK IN LOS ANGELES AND AGAIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT ADDED A THIRD SEGMENT -- BETWEEN SAN JOSE AND GILROY -- THERE ARE TRADE OFFS -- THAT COME WITH BLENDING OF BLENDING -- PROVIDES A LOT OF COST SAVINGS. FOR THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATED COSTS -- WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WERE BLENDED AND THERE IS ROUGHLY. TEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION TO BLENDING -- SO WE SEE THIS IS A POSITIVE -- POSITIVE MECHANISM. WITH THE BLENDING COME STRAIGHT OFF -- THE COST SAVINGS -- SORRY. WHAT POINTING? THEY ARE SHARING TRACKING CORRIDORS WITH OTHER REAL PROVIDERS -- AND SO THERE ARE LIMITS ON THE SPEED AT WHICH THE THE TRAINS CAN TRAVEL IN THOSE SHARE CORRIDORS. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SHARING -- OPERATIONS WITH TO RUN THE TRAINS THEIR LIMITED IN HOW MANY TRAINS THEY CAN RUN SO THAT'S A TRADE OFF AS COMPARED TO THE DEDICATED SYSTEM. THE THE IMPACTS AS THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF THOSE -- TRADE OFFS -- THOSE -- THE BLENDING. WILL NOT BE KNOWN AS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM BUILT -- WE ALSO DID AN ANALYSIS TO COMPARE THE COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED HAD THEY NOT BLENDED -- AND ARE NOW ALSO SHOWS THAT THE COST ESTIMATES WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED AND 11%. HAD THEY NOT BLENDED -- WITH THE BLENDING IT'S THE COST INCREASES ARE 81%. WHILE BLENDING HAS REDUCE THE SYSTEMS EXPECTED COSTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THERE ARE NO MORE OPTIONS TO BLEND THEY BLENDED EVERYWHERE THAT THEY CAN. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY FIND WAYS TO CONTAIN THE COST AND DEAL WITH THE COST OVERRUNS -- SO THAT THEY CAN DELIVER THE SYSTEM. NEXT -- MARKS GONNA TALK ABOUT THE CONTRACT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK RUNNER THE WITH A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. HI THE STATE ATER SUMMERS THE BEGINNING I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT -- THAT KIND OF CRITICAL MASS OF OUR FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE TO DO -- WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE AUTHORITIES CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES AND THEN I WILL SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE OTHER OBJECTIVES WE DISCUSSED -- IN THE REPORT. FOR BEING -- STARTING WITH THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY CONTRACTS FOR CONSTRUCTION THE AUTHORITY HAS THREE ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHICH RESCUED WITH AN INITIAL VALUE OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO COMPLETE -- THAT ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT JOE INSTEAD OF AUDIT COMMITTEE DIRECTED US TO EXAMINE WAS THAT RELATED TO CHANGE ORDERS OF THOSE CONTRACTS SO THOSE. CHANGE ORDERS FUNCTIONS AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND CAN ARISE WHEN. GENERALLY -- ADDITIONAL SCOPE OF WORK IS ADDED OR WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE THAT. INHIBIT THE COULD A CONTRACTOR FROM CARRYING OUT THE PLANS AS DESIGNED. ON AN EXAMPLE OF THE OF THE FIRST TYPE WOULD BE THE AUTHORITIES DECISION TO EXTEND -- THE THE NORTH MOST CONSTRUCTION PROJECT UP TO MADERA ASSETS AND IT JUST A CLEAR ADDITION OF SCOPE TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. HOWEVER WE ALSO. IDENTIFIED MANY INSTANCES ARE COSTING MANY MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RELATED -- TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT -- EMERGE DURING CONSTRUCTION THAT HAD TO DO WITH RISKY AUTHORITY WAS AWARE OF WHEN IT EXCEEDED THOSE CONTRACTS -- SPECIFICALLY -- CONTRACTS CHANGES TO THOSE THREE CONTRACTS TO DATE AT THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW HOW REPRESENTED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INCREASES OVER ORIGINAL VALUE BRINGING THE TOTAL COMBINED I TO THREE POINT ONE BILLION -- BUT ALSO AGAIN TO DATE EXECUTED -- A COMBINED ARE SHE WOULD HAVE I SHOULD SAY NINE MONTHS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE THREE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PRODUCT PACKAGES AS A WHOLE. HOW? WE EXAMINED -- THE IS THE CHANGE ORDERS BOTH A SUSPECT INDIVIDUAL CHANGE ORDERS AND ALSO A KIND OF MORE GLOBAL LEVEL. I WITH RESPECT INDIVIDUAL CHANGE ORDERS WE FOUND THAT AT CERTAIN INSTANCES. THE AUTHORITY WAS GOING AGAINST THE INITIAL -- ADVICE DETERMINATIONS OF THE OVERSIGHT FIRMS EMPLOYEES TO HELP IT REVIEW I REQUEST A CHANGES FROM THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE CHANGES HAVE MERIT AND ARE PROPERLY PRICED -- WHEN WE ASK THE AUTHORITY ABOUT ITS DECISION TO GO AGAINST THOSE INITIAL DETERMINATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY REPEATEDLY REFERENCED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH -- AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH EXTERNAL -- THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS REAL ROADS -- THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE LOCATION AND A RELOCATION. OF UTILITIES SUCH AS GAS LINES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. AND ADDITIONAL NOTABLY -- THE FAILURE OF THE AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE -- SAYS -- SUFFICIENT LAND ON WHICH TO CONSTRUCT THE PROJECT BEFORE IT EXECUTED THOSE CONTRACTS. ON A GLOBAL LEVEL. TO DATE WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT A PROBABLY AND EXECUTE CHANGE ORDERS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THOSE THOSE RISK AREAS. OF WHICH THE AUTHORITIES AWARE WHEN EXECUTED AS CONTRACTS ALSO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS OF NOW IN EXPECTED FUTURE CONTRACT CHANGES. AND PRICE ONLY 70% OF THOSE FUTURE CHANGES ARE TREATABLE THESE RISK AREAS. SO -- THESE THESE SCUM SMALL COLLECTION OF CAUSES HAVE REPRESENTED A YOU KNOW AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON ON COST OVERRUNS TODAY. WITH RESPECT -- TO THE FUTURE A RISK AND THAT FUTURE EXPECTED COSTS -- THE THIRTIES ALSO IN EXPECTING INCREASED TIME DELAYS. PUSHING BACK EXPECTED COMPLETION FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO GUYS OF THE STATE ARE ALLUDED TO THERE IS A FEDERAL DEADLINE OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO COMPLETE. THESE THREE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AS WELL AS A FOURTH PROJECT THAT WILL ACTUALLY LATE TRACK ACROSS THE CIVIL WORKS THAT ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED NOW. SO -- BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHORITIES AVERAGE PROGRESS TO DATE COMBINED ACROSS THESE THREE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IT WILL NEED. TO DOUBLE THE RATE OF ITS CONSTRUCTION BETWEEN NOW. TO THAT END WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY SURROUNDING -- ITS CURRENT AND FUTURE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT OF THESE TYPES OF CONTRACTS. WITH RESPECT TO ITS USE OF ITS OVERSIGHT FIRMS -- TO HOLD THE CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR CONTRACT TERMS IN A RECOMMENDATION THAT IF YOU THORLEY. SIDES TO DIVERGE FROM THE ADVICE OF HIS OVERSIGHT FROM TOO AGAIN IT EMPLOYS TO HELP IT KEEP THE CONTRACTOR -- TO THE STATE LETTER OF THE OF THE AGREEMENT. IT NEEDS. TO STOCKTON JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING THAT WE FOUND THAT WHEN THE AUTHORITY HAD HAD DIVERGE FROM FROM THAT OTHER THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS -- IT HAD NOT DOCUMENTED IT'S RATIONALE FOR DOING SO. INCLUDING WHY IT OCCASIONALLY -- SET A SETTLED ON A HIGHER DOLLAR AMOUNT AND THE OVERSIGHT FROM RECOMMENDED. WE ALSO -- MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THE AUTHORITY TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY AREN'T SURE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE OVERSIGHT FIRMS. RISK PROJECTIONS THE OTHER SIDE FIRMS THEMSELVES ARE THE COMPILER RESOURCE FOR FUTURE RISKS ASSOCIATED EACH OF THE THREE CONTRACTS. AND THAT IS THE THE SOURCE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE CONDUCTED ON FUTURE COSTS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKELY CAUSES -- AND SO THE THE RECOMMENDATION RE DESPERATE FIRMS ACROSS THREE SEPARATE CONTRACTS ARE ARE CONSISTENTLY ACCURATE WE AND TIMELY EVALUATING ALL THE KNOWN RISKS. FINALLY IS THE IS A C. R. ALLUDED TO WITH RESPECT TO THE THE FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS NAVIGATION TO TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY ABOUT THE ACTUAL TO DATE STATUS OF THESE PROJECTS -- IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND SO WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT HAPPEN ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. AND WE WERE FAIRLY PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD OF IT THAT THE AUTHORITY SHOULD EMPLOY. IN REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK MORE GLOBALLY AT THE AUTHORITIES CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- THE THIRTY APART FROM ITS ITS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OPERATES -- YOU KNOW MORE THAN A HUNDRED OTHER CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING PLANNING -- THE CONSTRUCTION OVERSIGHT THAT I MENTIONED FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND A LARGE CONSULTING CONTRACT WITH AN IDIOT REFERS TO AS THE RAIL DELIVERY PARTNER THE RDP -- AS THE STATE AUDITOR SUMMARIZING HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN ITS OPENING STATEMENTS THE AUTHORITIES HAD A DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF CHALLENGES RESPECT TO ITS CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- ARE OUR MOST OUR PRIOR OUT IN TWENTY TWELVE AS WELL AS INTERNAL LOT OF SENIOR THIRTY IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN NOTICING FORGET DEFICIENCIES IN THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AT THE AUTHORITY. IN RESPONSE TO ITS INTERNAL AUDITS OF THE MOST RECENT WAS IN SPRING OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY IMPLEMENTED -- BASICALLY COMPREHENSIVE IT'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO CONTRACT MANAGEMENT OF ITS CONTRACTS. IN DOING SO IT CLEARLY DELINEATED RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE STATE EMPLOYEES THAT OVERSEE THOSE CONTRACTS RELATED -- TO AT THE END ENSURING THAT INVOICE COSTS ARE APPROPRIATE THAT A CONTRACTOR WORK IS TIMELY OF QUALITY OF THE PARTY REQUIRED. AND THAT ANY COST OVER RUNS ARE -- IT BASICALLY TO DETERMINE THAT THE THE MARRIAGE AND JUSTIFICATION FOR COST OVERRUNS THAT THAT BEN MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN THE FORM OF CONTRACT AMENDMENTS OF WHICH THERE VAN. MANY -- WE BEGAN BY TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE THOSE -- POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FROM A BEST PRACTICE PERSPECTIVE AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH WITH THE CRITERIA THAT EXISTED INCLUDING THAT IN THE STATE CONTRACTING MANUAL. AND WE ALSO FIND IT THEY WENT WELL BEYOND WHAT WAS IN THE STATE CONTACT MANUAL BY NOT ONLY DELINEATING THE SPECIFIC. ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCESSES BY WHICH THE COUNTRY MANAGERS ARE CONDUCT THEIR WORK BUT ALSO BY REQUIRING A HIGH LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION FROM THIS CONTRACT MANAGERS. TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF THE DETERMINATIONS THAT THEY HAVE MADE ABOUT CONTRACTORS PERFORMANCE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE ARE TESTED NINE CONTRACT WITH A COMBINED VALUE OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WE FOUND AT THE THIRTY WAS A VERY RARELY. HAVE THE THIRTIES CONTRACT MANAGERS WERE VERY RARELY FOLLOWING THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INSPECTOR PERFORMING IN DOCUMENTING QUALITY CONTROL REVIEWS. AMENDMENT JUSTIFICATION REVIEWS AND THE LIKE WE THE ONE AREA WE FOUND. GENERAL COMPLIANCE WAS OR WAS WITH A AN ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENT THAT CONTRACT MANAGERS -- BASICALLY COMPLETE AND SIGN A CHECKLIST ASSOCIATED WITH EACH INVOICE SAYING THAT THEY'RE TESTING TO THE INVOICES COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY AND ALLOW ABILITY OF COSTS. HOWEVER IN MOST CASES WHEN WE ASK THOSE CONTACT MANAGERS FOR DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO HOW THEY DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS WERE ALLOWABLE THEY WERE NUMBER UNABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE. SO IN THAT INSTANCE WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUTHORITY STRENGTHENED ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO REQUIRE CONTRACT MANAGERS. TO RETAIN AND UPON REQUEST PROVIDE. THAT DOCUMENTATION TO SHOW THAT THESE COMPLEX INVOICES ARE IN FACT ACCURATE COMPLETE -- THAT IS A MENTION IS THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AGAIN WE FOUND OUT THEY WERE FAIRLY STRONG ISSUES WITH IT WITH COMPLIANCE. SO WE MADE A SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE THE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE OVERSIGHT OF CONTRACT MANAGEMENT ROLE AT THE AUTHORITY. THOSE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED -- TO REPLACING -- OR I SHOULD SAY. DEVELOP DEVELOPING A PROGRAM BY WHICH TO RECRUIT AND HIRE FULL TIME CONTRACT MANAGERS FOR PROFESSIONAL QUALIFIED IN WHOSE DUTY STATEMENTS REFLECT THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. WE FOUND THAT -- ALMOST NONE OF THE CONTRACT MANAGERS WE REVIEWED HAD ANY MENTION OF THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THEIR DUTY STATEMENTS. WE ALSO MADE A RECOMMENDATION AT THE THOSE -- THOSE CONTACT MANAGERS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THEIR SUPERVISORS WHO ARE NOMINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING SO. IN THE EXISTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BUT WE FOUND THAT THOSE CONTRACT MANAGERS SUPERVISORS DO NOT OUT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS EVEN TRAINED IN THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEMSELVES. FINALLY THE STATE AUDITOR ALLUDED TO WE FOUND SOME ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF CONTENT MANAGEMENT INTERNALLY AS PART OF THE REVISION TO ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE AUTHORITY ALSO CREATED A CONTRACT OR CONTENT MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT GROUP -- THAT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODIC REVIEWS OF CONTRACT MANAGERS COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIRED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT THAT THAT COULD BE DONE -- VERY LITTLE BASICALLY NEXT TO NOTHING WITH RESPECT TO ACTUALLY CONDUCTING THE US REVIEWS. I HAD THEY DONE THE THE WORK THAT WAS LAID OUT FOR THEM IN THEIR POLICIES PROCEDURES IS VERY LIKELY THEY WOULD HAVE HIT ON THE THE THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE FOUND AT AN EARLIER DATE -- AT AS IT STANDS CURRENTLY THAT OVERSIGHT GROUP IS STAFFED ENTIRELY BY OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS -- IN ADDITION TO THAT POTENTIALLY CREATING AN ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUE WE ALSO FOUND IS THE IS THE STATE AUDITOR LEAD TO THAT THAT MIGHT. INTRODUCE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AYE IN INSTANCES WHERE CONTRACT MANAGERS ARE IMPROPERLY DEFERRING TO TO CONTRACTED THIRD PARTIES -- WE WILL BE FELT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION TO ALSO BE FILL BOUNCE OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS. SO THAT SUMMARIZES OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER CONTRACT MANAGEMENT OF OF ALL OF THE CONTRACTS. OUTSIDE OF THE OF THE THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. I'LL BRIEFLY TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WE WE DISCUSSED IN OUR REPORT CHAPTER. THREE WITH RESPECT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS PUT IN PLACE -- THE STATE AUDITOR -- YOU KNOW CORRECTLY ASIDE ARE CORRECTLY SUMMARIZED OUR EXPERTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE POLICY ITSELF CONTAINS. LAUDABLE GOALS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES HOWEVER WE DID FIND ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND IN TERMS OF INCREASED EMPHASIS. AND AND TO TRACKING AND ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACTS OF ONGOING CONSTRUCTION SO WE MADE. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE PRE TAILORED TO THE AUTHORITY IN TERMS OF HOW THEY SHOULD -- INCREASED EMPHASIS ON THAT CONSTRUCTION WILL BE. THE MAIN BUSINESS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE -- WITH RESPECT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION AGAIN AS THE STATE AUDITOR ALLUDED. TO THE WE FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITY HAD -- JUSTIFICATION AND AND APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT GENTLY THAT THE THE UTILIZATION RATES IT REPORTS ARE ACCURATE AND SUPPORTED BY -- CONTRACTED INVOICES. HOWEVER WE DETERMINE IT THERE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTACTED VALUE THAT DO NOT SHOW UP ON THE AUTHORITIES UTILIZATION REPORTS OR CALCULATION. AND THE THIRTY HAD SOME SOME REASONS WHY THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE -- THEY'VE ALLUDED TO GUIDANCE FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES THAT NAY DIRECT STATES TO OMIT. CON ARTISTS ARE STATE AND HE'S WILL MAKE CONTRACTS WITH PUBLIC ENTITIES FROM ITS REPORTING -- AND THEY ALSO -- PROVIDED ACE SERIES OF OF SELECT TASKS THAT IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO HOLD. TO USING. THE 30% UTILIZATION REQUIREMENT. SO IN THE INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY GIVEN THE THE PROMISE OF THIS PRODUCT IN A LARGE DOLLAR AMOUNT BEING CONTRACTED OUT WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE AUTHORITY MAKE ITS REPORTING MORE COMPREHENSIVE. AND THAT IT -- IS MORE AGAIN MORE EXPLICIT BUNCH JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CONTRACT IT DOES CHOOSE TO EXEMPT FROM THIS PROGRAMS. THAT BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS FONG. I THINK VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK -- IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE -- AS MUCH YOU CAN BE I GUESS WITH THE DOCUMENTATION YOU CAN GET -- I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR AND KNOWING THAT YOU'VE DONE AUDITS IN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWELVE AND AS A BEEN INTERNAL AUDITS DONE -- AS WELL -- AFTER YOUR REVIEW HOW CONCERNED. SHOULD THE PUBLIC BE ON YOUR FINDINGS. I THANK THE THE PUBLIC ON THE LEGISLATURE THE STATE A CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED AS AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING REMARKS -- AND THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY TEN AND AGAIN AND AND AND TWENTY TWELVE AND CERTAINLY. THE AUTHORITIES ONLY OWN INTERNAL AUDITORS -- IDENTIFYING ISSUES WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE INTERNAL AUDITORS -- HAVE MADE -- HAVE NOT BEEN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED SO -- I THINK-- THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PROPOSED IN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWELVE CORRECT. WELL SIMILAR RECOMMENDATIONS NOT EXACT THE EXACT SAME. RECOMMENDATIONS BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE CONSISTENT FROM ONE AUDIT TO THE NEXT -- AND OF COURSE IT'S IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE POLICIES ON PAPER IT'S ANOTHER THING THAT TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES AS THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND EXECUTED WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THESE ISSUES -- MISMANAGEMENT ISSUES AS SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN THE AUTHORITY. WELL AS AS MISTER IT INDICATED AT AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN INTERNAL AUDIT THEY DEVELOP SOME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO WE LOOKED AND AS YOU INDICATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE ON PAPER. THEY'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED -- TO GETTING MORE STATE EMPLOYEES SO YOU HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE -- ALLOWING THE INTERNAL AUDITOR TO DO THEIR THEIR WORK -- AND THEN. REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL EXPERTS I'M YOU CERTAINLY NEED EXPERTS IN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT BUT SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE BY OUR STATE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE THE STATE'S BEST INTEREST IN MIND. SURE. LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION WITH YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR EXPERIENCE AND OF COURSE YOUR STAFF AND YOURSELF DOING THE PREVIOUS I DO YOU HAVE FAITH THAT THE ALL THE AUTHORITY WILL IMPLEMENT [inaudible] THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- WELL WHAT I HAVE SOME CONCERN I MEAN IT'S SPEAKING AS THE STATE AUDITOR I THINK THAT THE AUTHORITY IN THE PAST HAS SUGGESTED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO EMBRACE AND IMPLEMENT SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- SOME OF AND SOME OF THOSE CASES THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE REASON I HIGHLIGHTED THE ONE RELATED TO THEIR WITH. THEIR RESPONSE TO US -- CONCERNING. A REGARDING THE STATE EMPLOYEES GONNA SUBMIT A B. C. P. AND A YEAR AND A HALF FROM NOW OR FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. I WOULD HAVE HOPED OR WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THEM TO WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT DONE MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT'S AN ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO NOW IN FAIRNESS TO THE AUTHORITY IN OUR FIRST AUDIT. THINGS WERE JUST GETTING UP AND RUNNING AND YOU WOULD EXPECT YOU WOULD BE RELIANT ON EXTERNAL -- CONSULTANTS TO ASSIST BUT YOU NEED TO TRANSITION THAT THAT. KNOWLEDGE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT INTERNALLY WITH STATE EMPLOYEE SO -- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN WITH RESPECT -- TO HOW QUICKLY OR HOW -- VEHEMENTLY THE AUTHORITY WILL IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- A FEW MORE QUESTIONS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MAYBE -- A MARKETING. COMMENT ON THIS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOU SAY ON PAGE FORTY THREE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF THE DOCUMENTATION THAT PREVENTED US REACHING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY TIMELINESS. ACOSTA WORK PERFORMED UNDER THESE CONTRACTS WHAT IS THAT DID YOU ASKED FOR INFORMATION THEY JUST GONNA PROVIDED -- THAT'S CORRECT THE THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE VERY EXPLICIT IN THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION CONTRACT MANAGERS NEED TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN. DEMONSTRATING A RECORD OF TRACKING THE TIMELINESS AND QUALITY OF WORK AGAINST ESTABLISHED CRITERIA AGAINST THE CRIMES OF THE CONTRACT FUNDAMENTALLY -- THIS HAS TO DO WITH RESPECT TO THE DELIVERABLES OF THE CONTRACTOR HAS. AGREED TO PROVIDE IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS CONTRACTED RATE -- WE FOUND THAT NONE OF THE CONTRACT MANAGERS THAT WE THAT WE DID THAT WE TALK TO AS PART OF OUR AUDIT MAINTAINED THAT DOCUMENTATION -- AND MANY -- WE'RE PERFORMING IF THE LITTLE THAT WE COULD DISCERN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO IT PRECLUDED US FROM EVALUATING THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT JUDGMENT HAD NOT BANDLEADER DOCUMENTED AND SEC. IT JUST TO TO THE STATE ARTIST POINT IN IN KIND OF ADVOCATING THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOCUMENTATION SEVERAL CONTRACT MANAGERS. TOLD US AND CERTAINLY THE DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED FOR THIS OUT THAT THEY WERE IN FACT RELYING ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO PERFORM A SUBSTANTIVE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT DUTIES FOR WHICH THEY ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE SO THAT WAS A KIND OF A COMPOUNDING FACTOR OF THE LACK OF AUTHORITY. DOT A FORTY GENERATED DOCUMENTATION FOR US TO EVALUATE IN TERMS OF CONTRACTOR WORK. AND I JUST A QUICK SEARCH TO THE DOCTOR AT THE DOT IT I MEAN THEY WERE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED PROBABLY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS A LOCKET LACK OF DOCUMENTATION AND I COULD BE A PLUS OR MINUS A LOFT. IS THAT COMMON. NO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TYPICALLY SEE I MEAN DOCUMENTATION IS AN ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN A LOT IN A LOT OF AUDITS. BUT THE THE SIGNIFICANCE OR THE THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PARTICULAR REPORT AND A NUMBER OF TIMES AS I WAS JUST DISCUSSING WITH MR WRITER IN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS. OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE WENT TO A CONTRACT MANAGER IS SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT THAT CONTRACT MANAGER WOULD REFER US TO THE ACTUAL CONSULTANT. UP FOR WHICH HE OR SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING OVERSIGHT TO GET THE ANSWERS THAT IS NOT STRONG OVERSIGHT -- ON BEHALF OF THE THE AUTHORITY SO THE THE THE NUMBER OF THE VOLUME OF INSTANCES IN THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT IS IS GREATER THAN THAN WHAT WE TYPICALLY SEE WHEN WE OUT WE GO OUT AND CONDUCT ON AT WORK. BY LAST QUESTION YOU AND YOU FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THIS ANY WAY YOU WANT BUT IF YOU ARE A TEACHER AND YOU'RE GIVING A GRADE. IN TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE AYE SPIRO HOW ABOUT AN INCOMPLETE -- I I SITE ASKING. THAT'S NOT A PASSING GRADE AS I INDICATED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND THEIR CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY US IN THE PAST. AND CERTAINLY BEEN RAISED BY THE INTERNAL AUDIT GROUP THE GAO CAME IN AND DID SOME AUDIT WORK SO IT'S NOT THAT THE AUTHORITY AS MISTER PATTERSON INDICATED THAT'S NOT THAT THE AUTHORITY HASN'T BEEN AWARE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN AUDITS. ALSO WERE AWARE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES -- WITH RESPECT TO LAND ACQUISITION IT CETERA WE FOUND SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE AT WHERE THEY KNEW SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AS FAR BACK AS TWENTY THIRTEEN PERHAPS FURTHER BACK THAN THAT. YET THEY DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD SO -- WE REALLY DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT PAST DECISIONS AND AND DECISION MAKING GOING FORWARD IF THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE REALLY HAS TO BE SOME CHANGE HAPPENING AT THE AUTHORITY I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN IN YOUR IN YOUR AUDIT IN -- DID YOU HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO MEASURE TO SEE IF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM WAS EVEN QUALIFIED. TO BE IN THIS POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO THE THE STATE APPOINTED CONTRACT MANAGERS WHAT WE WHAT WE DID FIND SIR WAS THAT -- NEITHER THEIR OFFICIAL TITLES NOR THEIR POSITION NAMES NOR THEIR DUTY STATEMENTS. REFLECTED THE TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH THEY WERE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- SO. WHERE EVEN IF THEY WERE QUALIFIED THEY WOULD WOULD BE? QUESTIONABLE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR POOR PERFORMANCE SO. IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE WE TARGET THAT SHORTCOMING AND SAY YOU KNOW IF THESE IF THESE PEOPLE ARE TO BE CONTRACT MANAGERS THEY NEED TO BE DOING A FULL TIME. THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT BE THE CLEAR EXPECTATION TERMS OF THEIR THEIR TO THEIR TITLE OR DESIGNATION AS WELL AS THEIR THEIR DUTY STATEMENTS OF THE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO IT. SO I'M JUST GOING TO THE OTHER COMPONENT OF IT DID YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO SEE IF THE AUTHORITY BOARD WAS QUALIFIED FOR OVERSIGHT. UP WHAT WE WHAT WE DID TALK ABOUT IN THE REPORTED TO BE WE WE WE ALLUDED TO REPORT THAT TO SET OUT OR PUT OUT IN IN AUGUST RELATED TO THE THE BAY BRIDGE TOLL. GRAHAM THE RETROFIT AND WE DETERMINED THAT -- INCREASED EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF THAT OF THAT PROGRAM AND MADE HUGE STRIDES IN HELPING IT STAY CLOSE TO BUDGET AND PUSH BACK ON SOME SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE CHANGES TO CONTRACT AND TIME LINES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE AUTHORITY. I WILL SAY THAT WE WE DO NOTING THE REPORT LAERTES BETWEEN THAT PROJECT IN THE AUTHORITY NAMELY THE EXISTENCE OF THE AUTHORITIES FOR OF DIRECTORS. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED HOWEVER THE YOU KNOW AS WE SAY THE EXISTENCE OF THAT OF THAT BOARD RECORDS HAS NOT ITSELF. BY ITS NATURE PRESERVE PREVENTED THE TYPES OF COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS THAT HAVE MANIFESTED TODAY. SO THIS COULD JUST BE A POSITION FOR THE PEER REVIEW GROUP THAT THEY COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE OF STEPPING UP THEIR ROLE SO THE WE'VE GROUP IS ALSO A POOR COMPONENT -- OF EXT TAKE THE EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT ALTHOUGH I MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HASN'T UNTIL RECENTLY BEEN FULLY STAFFED SO -- IN IN CERTAINLY IN DOING THAT INCREASED OVERSIGHT IN ANY FORM WOULD BE WOULD BE POSITIVE. SO ONE OF THE REASONS THE AUTHORITY GIVES FOR NOT HIRING MORE STATE WORKERS AT THE PROJECT HAS A FINITE LIFESPAN -- I MEAN IT. LOOKS LIKE IT IS MORE THAN MY LIFESPAN -- AND THAT IS THERE. THAT THERE'S NOT MANY CONTRACT MANAGERS IN THE STATE FOR SERVICE. ARE. MAYBE CALL FIVE MANAGERS -- HOW WOULD YOU WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THIS? SAID TAKE TO TAKE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS OUT OF ORDER SIR -- I'D I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY ANALYSIS THAT THE AUTHORITY PERFORM TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BUT THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS -- THIS TALENT IN THE STATE'S CIVIL SERVICE POOL SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. I WILL SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT. IF THE AUTHORITY IS TO HAVE ANY PERMANENT ROLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM THEY WILL BE IN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- THE AUTHORITIES NOT GOING TO BE OPERATING AT SYSTEM IS NOT GOING BE DIRECTLY MAINTAINING ITS SYSTEM THAT WILL BE MANAGING CONTRACTORS TO DO SO. SO I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE NOTION THAT THESE ARE. LIMITED DURATION APPOINTMENTS AND AS YOU POINT OUT SIR THAT. EVEN IF IF THEY WERE TO FALL OFF WHEN CONSTRUCTION THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETE WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT YOU KNOW MORE THAN A DECADE OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. A I JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE -- PROPOSAL WAS GENERATED BY THE THE AUTHORITY WE WERE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW THEY OBTAIN THE STAFF AND WE IT'S DIDN'T HIGHLY POSSIBLE THE AUTHORITY COULD LOOK INTO SHARING STAFF TO AND USE WITH OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS CALTRANS -- SO WE WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY OPEN ABOUT HOW THE THIRTY CAN ACCOMPLISH AND STAFFING NEEDS THING TO GET THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SOON IT ALSO IN YOUR CAPACITY DID YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK IN. ON THE PROJECTS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION OF THE FISSION SEES -- WHEN I WAS DWN THERE TOURING IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF JUMPING AROUND TO MAKE WORK -- BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION DID YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT THE THE PROJECTS WERE. BEING DONE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER. THE SPECIFIC -- CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCING WAS NOT THE FOCUS OF OUR OF OUR AUDIT HOWEVER WE YOU KNOW WE WE OBVIOUSLY GET TO THE QUESTION OF ASSISTANCE EFFICIENCY THROUGH. THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE APPLY TO TRACKING PROGRESS TO DATE VERSUS WHAT THE SCHEDULE PROGRESS SHOULD BE AND FOUND THAT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY LACK AND GIVEN TO THE GROUND IF THEY NEED TO MAKE UP. AND MY LAST QUESTION MISTER CHAIR. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RIGHT AWAY ACQUISITION -- PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED HAVE YOU. GIVEN ANY KIND OF RECOMMENDATION ON HOW -- THAT THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD MAYBE LIKE THIS. IS THERE A PLAN B. THAT IF IT'S ONEROUS AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A LENGTHY PROCESS. THAT MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER ROUTE TO GO INSTEAD OF JUMPING AROUND WASTING MONEY OR MAYBE HOPE YOU KNOW NOT HALTED PROJECT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT. UTILIZING THE FUNDS. SO WE DID AND FORGIVE ME FOR NOT MENTIONING DURING MY PRESENTATION WE DIDN'T MAKE -- A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFIC TO FUTURE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING WORK -- NOTABLY ONE OF THOSE WAS THAT BEFORE IN AND PROCURING ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION WORK AT PLANTS TO DO -- FIRST AND CHECK A PASS IN THE COMING YEARS THAT THE AUTHORITY NEEDS TO SET AND ACHIEVE BENCHMARKS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF RIGHT AWAY IDENTIFICATION AND RELOCATION OF TOADIES AND CERTAINLY. REQUIRED AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTY STAKEHOLDERS TO PREVENT EXACTLY THIS SORT OF SUCH SCENARIO FROM REPAIR WE PLAYING ITSELF. YOU THIRTY HAS PUT IN PLACE A DETAILED -- BASELINE SCHEDULE THAT DOES IN THE THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES HOWEVER THE AUTHORITY EVEN DURING OUR ENGAGEMENT. SAID TO US THAT. IT MAY HAVE TO REASSESS THAT BASELINE DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE FUNDING THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM. NEAR THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT. WE DON'TAGREE WITH THE DECISION TO TO TAKE ON THE REST THE AUTHORITY DID WHEN IT ENTER CONSTRUCTION CENTRAL VALLEY NEARLY IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL -- GRANT MONEY. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BASED ON THAT ANSWER STRUCTURE. DID YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE A CHANGE ORDER THAT WAS ISSUED OF FROM I THINK WAS TO SALIVA. ON AN EARLY MYT BAND -- AND THE VERY PART OF THE START OF THE PROJECT. OF KNOWING THAT IT WAS A CHANGE OR BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACT WAS ORDERED INTO REALLY. AND THE AMOUNT. SO I I'M NOT SURE I AND I COULD SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC CHANGE ORDER YOU'RE REFERRING -- TO I WE DID AS PART OF OUR REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL CHANGE ORDERS LOOK AT TWO THAT WERE EXECUTED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LEGAL SEVEN AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL -- PROCESS ONE OF THOSE WAS FOR THE CONSTRUCTOR PACK CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE -- CONTRACT WITH TO TO BRAINY DOLLARS WITH -- AND BECAUSE THE DRIVING BECAUSE OF THAT AS STATED IN A PUBLIC CHANGER WAS RIGHT OF WAY DELAY -- THE HOW THE AUTHORITY DID A CERTAIN -- ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH VERY ARRIVING AT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ADDRESS IN THE REPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMAN BELL -- THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE JUST EVERYBODY ON THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS IS SUCH A GREAT JOB BOND -- IN COMPLETING THIS -- ESPECIALLY -- THE TIMING OF YOUR REPORT IS IMPORTANT. SO -- I HAD I HAD A COUPLE -- GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST. I'M JUST GONNA DO SOME CHECK COSTS -- ON WHAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD SHOT -- REQUESTED AND SEE -- KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE AUDIT WHEN WE ORIGINALLY REQUEST CERTAIN THINGS. BECAUSE I WAS [inaudible] SOMEWHAT SPECIFIC. AND THINGS I ASKED. FOR OKAY SO -- EVALUATING THE AUTHORITIES PROCESS FOR REVIEWING APPROVING DESIGN BUILD. CONTRACT CHANGE ORDER YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THAT -- WAS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL BEYOND OR STATUTORY AUTHORITY WE NOW HAVE THAT YOU NEED. TO RECOMMEND TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON THAT SUBJECT. A WITH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE SENATOR BUT WE WE DID DISCUSS THE THE REPORTING -- ABOUT PROGRESS NOT REPORTING IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTION OF CHANGE ORDERS ANY CONCERN THAT THE REPORTING WITH THE NEED FOR THAT REPORTING -- AS WE AS WE DEMONSTRATE IN A FIGURE IN OUR CHANGE ORDERS HAVE A REAL MEASURABLE IMPACT IN TERMS OF TIME AND DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT PUSH THE AND THE LINE OR THE GOAL LINE OUT AN UPWARDS FOR THE AUTHORITY. THEREBY INCREASING BY DEFINITION THE RATE OF SPEED NEEDS TO TO A FACT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT DEADLINE SO. CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WE'D. BE HAPPY TO DO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS ARE ANY -- PROCESS CHANGES OR LEGISLATIVE STATUTE CHANGE STATUTORY CHANGES. DAD NEED TO TAKE PLACE -- TO LOOK AT WAYS OF EXPEDITING THE PROJECT. SENATOR WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY ANYTHING -- AS MR ENERGY INDICATED WE HAVE THE ONE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION -- REGARDING THE QUARTERLY REPORTING BUT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY ANY STATUTORY CHANGES THAT NEED. EITHER ADDITIONS TO STATUTE OR STATUTORY. OKAY TO THE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE -- LOOK AT THE AUTHORITIES OF EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT -- COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND ESERVER -- APPROPRIATE -- THE H. MARKS INDICATORS REGARDING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT. OF METRIC SO WE CAN HOUSE -- AVAILABLE TO US. SENATOR FORGIVE ME FOR A MEETING THAT SUMMARY FROM MY INITIAL PRESENTATION WE WE DID. WE DID. WE DID LOOK AT THE AUTHORITIES PROCESS BY WHICH IT -- CALCULATES AND REPORTS ON ITS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CONSTRUCTION CENTRAL VALLEY AS WORLD SPENDING ELSEWHERE. WE DETERMINE IF FORTY USES A CHANNEL ACCEPTED -- TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES FOR ESTIMATING IMPACT BASED ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT EXPENDED AND TO THE ECONOMIC SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AND TO WHICH IT'S BEING SPENT -- WE DID IDENTIFIED SOME ISSUES WITH THE THE PRECISION OF SOME OF THE BACKUP DATA THAT THE AUTHORITY HAD TO SUPPORT -- IT'S DATA ENTRY BUT ALREADY MADE IN TERMS OF DESTINATION SOME OF SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT FACE THAT THOSE ARE REASONABLE OUT OR AT LEAST DO NOT DO NOT IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY IMPACT THE ACCURACY OF THE OF THE ESTIMATES THAT IT REPORTS -- SO WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN AT THIS POINT THAT THE AUTHORITY IS UNDER SIGNIFICANT UNDER ALL REPORTING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ITS ACTIVITIES. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S GOOD I THINK WE'RE WE'RE I'M INTEREST OF FOLLOWING UP ON THAT -- HOW ABOUT -- SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES. TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHORITY ON CONTRACTS. IN TERMS OF BENEFITING -- OUR GOALS AND STATE -- TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS ONE OF THE REQUEST AN A ON IT YEAH CAN YOU COVER THAT THAT WASN'T COVERED IN REMARKS. YES SIR -- AS AS WHAT WHAT AS WE DID JERRY MARKS THE THE AUTHORITY IS CLOSE TO ME IS 30% -- BENCHMARK SO TO THAT BY THAT MEASURE IF THEY ARE DOING AT LEAST THEY ARE CLOSE TO CHEATING THEIR OWN ESTABLISHED GOAL FOR FOR BRINGING SMALL INCIDENTS BUSINESSES TO THE TABLE -- WHAT DID NOT SHOW UP IN A REPORT OF WHAT WE DID PERFORM IN THIS AREA AS WE ALSO INTERVIEWED A SELECTION OF ITS CURRENT CONTRACTORS? TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD ANY FEEDBACK TO BE A STORY ABOUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE THE PRIME CONTRACTORS THE LARGER THE LARGER CONTRACTORS FOR WHICH THEY SUBCONTRACTED SMALL BUSINESSES -- AND THEY HAD SOME SOME FEEDBACK WAITED TO THAT THE TIMELINESS OF SOME REIMBURSEMENTS -- SOME OF THE WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS UNTIL CONTRA COMPLETION AN OWNER SO WE DID SHARE THOSE COMMENTS WITH THE AUTHORITY -- AS PART OF HEALTH IN A REPORT THAT'S NOT IN THE REPORT. SO THAT WAS ASKED OF WHEN WE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR BUT YOU TO PUT A REPORT. WITCHY BIT SO I'M A LITTLE -- CONCERNED ABOUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME. SOME OF BECAUSE I ASKED FOR THE INFORMATION NOT THE AUTHORITY THE WEEK WE ASKED FOR IT IN OUR DIRECTION DO YOU. YOU YOU NEED TO REPORT TO US WHEN WE ASK YOU FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT INFORMATION. BECAUSE I THINK -- THE LEGISLATORS COULD BE VERY INTERESTED. IN -- GROWING THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY -- ENCOURAGING SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES. AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT THIS QUESTION AND THIS. AND PERSONALLY I THINK WE ARE PUBLISHED YOU KNOW. WE DID IT IN SB. ONE AND BY THE WAY MR FRAZIER GRADUATIONS -- WE'RE VERY WE WERE VINDICATED WARMING. ALSO SO IT WAS IN SB -- ONE TO GROW THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THE REASON WHY WE PUT THAT IN THIS AUDIT REQUEST. WAS WE NEEDED TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY IDEAS. OF HOW TO DO A BETTER JOB. IN DOING SO AND YOU DON'T PUT IT IN YOUR AUTO. SO YOU NEEDED WANTED TO YOU KNOW. THAT WAS REQUESTED BUT WASN'T IN. SENATOR WE DO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BASED ON MR RIGHTIES A RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION WE DO HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE AUDIT REPORT RELATED -- TO THE UTILIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES THAT WAS A QUESTION YOU ASKED US AND SO WE DO -- DISCUSS AND THIS IS AN AREA AS AS WE INDICATED IN OUR COMMENTS THAT OVERALL THE AUTHORITY IS DOING A GOOD JOB THEY SET A 30% -- GOAL -- AS AS FAR AS WANTING THAT I FELT THAT THEIR REPORTING OVERALL AS TO THE PARTICIPATION UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT CERTAINLY. YOUR YOUR COMMUNITY IS THE ONE THAT'S GETTING THOSE. CONTRACT SO -- THE LAST YEAR IT WAS -- SOMETHING THAT -- A LOT OF US ARE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE PUT IT IN THE AUDIT REQUESTED DETERMINE WHETHER OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THE AUTHORITY EXPEDITE THE PROJECT AND REDUCE CROC COST. THROUGH COOPERATION WITH OTHER TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. OUR OWN SEARCHES TRANCE ARENA LINES -- YOU KNOW JOINT -- TRANSIT FACILITIES -- CAPTURING ADDITIONAL VALUE THROUGH CONSTRUCTION PROJECT CAP VALUE CAPTURES. THE NEW ADDRESS -- THE AUDITS -- OR ANY KIND OF INFORMATION YOU HAVE. A REAL. TO TO TO EXPEDITING THE PROJECT. AND REDUCING COSTS IN THOSE AREAS. YES SENATOR WITH RESPECT AND I WANTED. TO SO WITH AND WE AND WE ENTER THE AUDIT WITH THAT SO THAT IS AN OPEN QUESTION AND AND IDENTIFIED AND THE CONCEPT OF SHARING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE THAT CAN HELP EXPEDITE. CONSTRUCTION BY LIMITING AT THE SCHOOL OF CONSTRUCTION CERTAINLY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AS AS AS WAS STATED EARLIER THE AUTHORITY HAS UTILIZED THAT THAT TECHNIQUE ON THE SENATE JUST OPENED SO -- FROM ALL THE WAY FROM SENATE IS GOING TO GILROY. AND AGAIN THROUGH THE THE DENSE URBAN ENVIRONMENT OF OF BURBANK TO LA DOWNTOWN LA -- UNFORTUNATELY THE BETWEEN DID THERE ARE NO CLEAR OPTIONS AT THE AUTHORITY COULD USED -- TO TO YOU GET GET IN IN IN COLLABORATION WITH EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT THAT WAS THE IN THE DIRECTIVE ON AUTO. CORRECT CERTAINLY AND WE IDENTIFIED IN AN EDIT NOTATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST -- IN ADDITION THE THE AUTHORITY POINTED OUT THAT -- AND THIS IS A TRIBUTE TO THE AUTHORITY BUT FOR THEIR TIME TRAVEL ESTIMATES THEY ARE UP AGAINST THE TO OUR FORTY MINUTE. REQUIREMENT AND SO ADDITIONAL BLENDING AS AS WE NOTED PREVIOUSLY DOES CARRY WITH IT LOWERED MAXIM TRAVELING SPEEDS. SO THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A CONCERN FOR BINDING ADDITIONAL SEGMENTS OF THE SISTER WAY COULD TECHNICALLY BE DONE IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE SO THAT'S THAT'S UNKNOWN. WELL AS MISTER REGNERY INDICATED WE WE TALK TO THE AUTHORITY ABOUT THE BLINDING -- OPTIONS THAT THEY ENGAGED IN AND AS MUCH RIDER INDICATED THE SEGMENTS THAT THEY FELT THEY COULD USE CALTRAIN OR EXISTING TRACK AND HAVE THAT PARTNERSHIP -- THEY THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS FOR THAT SO FUTURE CONSTRUCTION IN THE AREAS -- THAT THAT REMAIN THERE IS NOT THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TRACK. ARE WITH WITH OTHER ENTITIES AND AS MISTER RIGHT INDICATED THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE THIS TRAIN -- BE ABLE TO MEET TIME LINES AS FAR AS TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES AND THEY'RE UP AGAINST THAT THEY'RE WITHIN THREE MINUTES OF THAT SO. THAT STATE LAW POTENTIALLY COULD CHANGE THE TIMING OF OF HOW LONG -- HOW QUICKLY A TRAIN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO GET A PASSENGER FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER? BUT AS FAR AS AS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE DIDN'T SEE ANY OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CERTAINLY DEFERRED OF THE AUTHORITY IF THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL IDEAS PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT THOSE TODAY CUT. DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT WE WE TRIED TO IDENTIFY -- WORKING WITH THEIR EXPERTS -- AND DID NOT SEE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOR YOU KNOW SHARING TRACKER USING THE BLENDING OPTION WHICH HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL FROM CERTAIN PERSPECTIVE CERTAINLY COST SAVINGS BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS IT SLOWS THE TRAINS DOWN AND IT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF TRAINS YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO RUN. ABOUT -- THE VALUE CAPTURE ELEMENT -- REGARDING -- YES SIR I WE DID WE DID LOOK INTO VALUE CAPTURES AND INCLUDE NOT ONLY TO THE THAT THE FINANCING FINANCING DISTRICTS -- WITH LOCAL STATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS AS HAS FORMALLY CONSIDER THAT IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION THERE THEY'RE PUTTING FORTH IS A CONSIDERATION SPECIFICALLY IN THEIR STATION PLANNING -- ENDEAVORS AND SO WE REVIEWED SEVERAL STATION PLANS FOR CITIES -- PLAN TO INCLUDE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS ULTIMATELY INCLUDING FRESNO AND SO FORTH THAT THAT DO IDENTIFY THOSE VALUE CAPTURE TECHNIQUES AS A AS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER WE DETERMINE THAT THE THE THE STATION PLANNING PROCESS IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY AND SO WHILE THOSE THOSE AT THIS TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY HOPE PROMISE AND NOW IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR US TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE. IN THE AUTHORITY WAS GOING TO MOVE ON THEM OR FOR THAT DECISION WAS GONNA BE BENEFICIAL. DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE FURTHER EXPLORED. YEAH I I YEAH I BELIEVE SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S IT'S AN OPEN A POTENTIALLY VERY INNOVATIVE WAY OF HELPING OFFSET SOME OF THE THE COST FOR SYSTEM THAT NEEDS ALL THE HELP I CAN GET IN TERMS OF REDUCING COSTS. DO YOU -- DID YOU EXAMINED -- THE TUNNELING ASPECT ENTERS EXPEDITING -- CONSTRUCTION TIME LINES THROUGH THE TUNNELING OF THE TOTALING ELLO ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT. SINCE I NOTICE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY WE BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE IN THAT TUNNELING IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT OF A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY THAN EXISTING CONSTRUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN PLAYING WITH THE LAYS. THE OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN IN THE REPORT THAT -- YOU KNOW THE PAST COULD COULD REOCCUR REEKER IN TERMS OF DELAYS TO THE PLANNED SCHEDULE FOR TUNNELING BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ALIGNMENTS. SO FURTHER EXPLORATION. CERTAINLY PUT THAT IN THAT CATEGORY -- WE HAVE SP ONE OH NO LOG THE VOTERS APPROVED THE BY REJECTING THE AND INITIATIVE -- WE HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL -- DO YOU THINK YOUR WROTE HAVE YOU HAVE YOU OF CONSIDERED -- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL -- ROLE IN OVERSIGHT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. OF FUNDING AND WITHOUT -- BE OF ASSISTANCE. TO US THE LEGISLATORS TO GET REPORTS. ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LIKE THEY REPORT ON OLDER TRANSPORTERS SUPPOSED TO REPORT ON ALL. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS -- TO OUR COMMITTEE -- OUR COMMUNITIES OF BUDGET COMMITTEES AND POLICY COMMITTEES. THE AFFECTED SPECTER GENERAL SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN OVERSIGHT. ON HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. ABSOLUTELY I THINK HAVING ANY EXTERNAL THEY WOULD BE EXTERNAL TO THE AUTHORITY AND BE WOULD BE REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE. TO DO CONDUCT WORK MORE FREQUENTLY -- pSUPPORT I THINK THAT'S A AN EXCELLENT IDEA THAT THEY MORE OVERSIGHT AND MORE FREQUENT. CHECKING IN WITH THE AUTHORITY AND HAVING THAT EXTERNAL AUDITOR BEING ABLE TO REPORT TO YOU -- AT THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WELL THE AUTHORITY AS A DRESSING RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESSING DIRECTIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IS A POSITIVE -- A POSITIVE THING FOR THE STATE THE THE OF THE FORTY AN INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS PRETTY BROAD WE WE LEFT IT BROUGHT ON PURPOSE. CORRECT JIM AND IT WAS DONE. IT SAID ANY TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS IN THE CALIFORNIA. SO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DOESN'T NEED ANY LEGISLATIVE. CHANGES OTHER THAN. THE WE REQUEST AND I I WOULD REQUESTED MAYBE. OUR COMMITTEES WOULD REQUEST THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ASSIST US IN OVERSIGHT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT CERTAINLY IN ANYTHING OUR OFFICE COULD DO TO ASSIST THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS FAR AS WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST OR WORK THAT THEY ARE INTENDING TO DO WE'D BE HAPPY. TO PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT WE CAN THANK YOU. I JUST GOT A CLARIFICATION THAT WE DID FINALIZING WAS FOR CALTRANS ONLY INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT WITH LEGISLATION WE CAN BROADEN. IT WAS IT WAS WRITTEN IN A WAY WHERE IT WAS CALTRANS. BUT ANY FUNDS. THAT WERE -- APPROVED. SO THIS WORK ON IN MY ROOM MY WAY I THINK WE ALREADY OUT THERE. HOOKS INTO -- IF YOU WANT TO SET UP ONE THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER PATTERSON -- I WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- THE BE SIMILAR QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED TO THE AUTHORITY FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE MEETING THE DEADLINE -- WE'VE GOT TWO ISSUES HERE THAT ARE OF DEEP CONCERN FOR ME I THINK AND I THINK YOU HAVE EXPRESSED AS WELL. THE EARLY USE OF THE FEDERAL MONEY WHICH I THINK EXPRESSLY DEMONSTRATES THAT. I THINK THE FEDERAL WHAT IT IS GOING TO HAVE -- GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. AND SECONDLY THAT THAT THE THE DEADLINE THAT THAT THE THE TIME HERE. YOUR AT YOUR SAYING THAT IT NEEDS TO YOU NEED TO DOUBLE. THE CONSTRUCTION IN FOUR YEARS. THERE IS MY MIND NO INDICATION THAT PREVIOUS HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE. CAN EVEN BEGIN TO APPROACH THAT EXPECTATION SO I THINK THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION GOING FORWARD. ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FEDERAL AUDIT. WHAT IS YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL? IN THE ABILITY. OF THIS STORY UNDER YOUR AUDIT AND WHAT YOU KNOW TODAY. TO MEET THAT DEADLINE AND AVOID THE POTENTIAL. OF CLAWBACK IN OTHER WORDS. WHAT IS PLAN BE? WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD DEFER TO THE AUTHORITY FOR PLAN B. -- ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION THAT'S WHY WE RAISED IT AS A CONCERN IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE WERE VERY CONCERNED. AND AND AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THE THE AUTHORITY ITSELF WHEN IT PRESENTED THEIR PLAN TO THE BOARD -- QUALIFIED AND SAID THIS OF SCHEDULE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE FEDERAL DEADLINE OR TO MEET THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS THE DEADLINE THEY'VE SET FOR THEMSELVES BUT THE FEDERAL DEADLINE IS DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S WHY WE DID THE ANALYSIS TO DEMONSTRATE. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE AUTHORITY HAS TO YOU KNOW WORK TWICE AS QUICKLY AS IT HAS THUS FAR AND WE HAVE WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. WHETHER TO CHI MOBILE SO THEY'RE DOING THE APT DESCRIPTION HERE IS ONGOING SERIOUS CONCERNS GOING FORWARD TO MEET THE DEADLINE THAT IS THAT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF ONE ON ONE ALSO. THE THE THE GENERAL -- VALUE PROPOSITION -- OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT WAS -- PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS. I THINK CAN'T THREE ELEMENTS TO IT SPEED TIME AND COMPETITIVENESS. WE ARE NOW HERE [inaudible] YEARS LATER. THE SPEEDS ARE GOING DOWN. THE TIME IS GOING UP. AND THE COMPETITIVENESS WITH OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION I THINK IS GOING DOWN. AS A RESULT. THE ARC OF THIS PROJECT APPEARS. TO ME. THAT IT SIMPLY. IS NOT DELIVERING. THE KIND OF SPEED TIME AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WAS PROMISED DO YOU HOLD SIMILAR SERIOUS CONCERNS. ABOUT THE SPEED TIME AND COMPETITIVENESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE SPEEDS AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE COMPETITIVE TIMES. EACH YEAR THERE'S NOT THERE AT THE THE MARKET PLACE ISN'T GOING TO CHIU SOMETHING WHERE THEY CAN STILL FLY FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO -- IN ON AN AIRPLANE FOR HALF THE COST. WE NEED THIS IS THAT THIS IS A COMPETITIVENESS. VALUE PROPOSITION THAT I THINK THE THE LONGER THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS MADE THESE DECISIONS. TO SCALE BACK AND SCALED DOWN -- THE SPEEDS PUSH THE TIME'S UP IN THIS ISSUE THAT'S GOING. TO IMPACT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS PROJECT GOING FOR THIS ARC CONCERNS ME AND DOES IT CONCERN -- YOU IS THE AUDITOR. YES IT DOES -- THAT'S WHY WE POINTED OUT IN THE REPORT MISTER PATTERSON THAT THE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF TRAINS EVEN THOUGH BLENDING. HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COST OF THE PROJECT BY REDUCING COSTS. THEY FLIP SIDE IS THAT YOU HAVE FEWER TRAINS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN. WE CLEARLY DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT THE AUTHORITIES ACKNOWLEDGE UNTIL IT IT IT'S FINALIZED THEY WON'T KNOW THE FULL IMPACT OF THAT AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF TRAINS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO RUN -- AS FAR AS THAT TRACK THAT THEY'RE SHARING WITH OTHER OPERATORS AND CERTAINLY THE COMPETITIVENESS. WHEN SOMEONE'S MAKING A CONSUMER IS MAKING A DECISION? AS TO DO I TAKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH IS GONNA TAKE TWO AND A HALF HOURS -- OR TWO HOURS FORTY MINUTES -- AND COST X. AMOUNT COMPARED TO LOS ANGELES SO I THINK -- THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO SPEED NUMBER OF TRAINS AVAILABILITY -- SHOULD CONCERN -- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU APPRECIATE. MICHELLE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- YOU START OFF YOUR PRESENTATION -- BY. STATING THAT WHAT ONE OF YOUR KEY FINDINGS WAS CONTRACTORS OVERSEEING CONTRACTORS -- AND THAT. THAT COULD LEAD TO A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. ARM. AND YOU TALK ABOUT -- THEY NEED TO HIRE STATE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN THE CONTRACTOR TO TRY TO AVOID THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IN TERMS OF THE RDP CONSULTANTS -- THE THE RAIL DELIVERY PARTNER CONSULTANTS -- THE DO YOU DISCUSS IN IN YOUR REPORT. WHO THEY ARE OR HOW MANY? THAT'S CORRECT SURE WE DO WE DO DISCUSS THE RTP IN A NUMBER OF CONTACTS -- I'D HAVE TO REFER TO SPECIFIC NUMBER IN THE REPORT BUT THERE OR OVER THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE POSITIONS -- AS OF THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW THAT ARE STAFFED BY THE RTP CONSISTING OF A CONSULTING FIRM AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS -- SPECTOR THE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST SPECIFICALLY THE WAY WE SAW THAT MANIFESTING ITSELF WAS THAT. IN A IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH STATE EMPLOYEE CONTRACT MANAGERS WERE -- BASICALLY DELEGATING OR DEFERRING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THEY WERE THEY WERE DOING IT TOO RT P. CONSULTANT PROJECT MANAGERS IN THE FIELD WHO ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE WITH THE CONTRACTORS. THE YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTORS OF ORIGIN THERE -- AND THE COVER IS ITSELF WHEN THE OVERSIGHT BODY THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS CONSTRUCTED A WHOLE CONTRACT MANAGERS ACCOUNTABLE THAT IS THE STATE WORKERS. WOULD NEED TO STEP IN AND YOU KNOW INTERVENE IN INSTANCES WHERE STATE WORKERS WERE OVER RELIANT ON RT P. CONSULTANTS HOWEVER THE OVERSIGHT. PERFORMING OVERSIGHT WITH THEMSELVES ALREADY CONSULTANT SO TO US THAT CREATED A POTENTIAL CONFLICT. SO A BIT BUT I MEAN WHO WHO WHO ARE THESE ARE TO BE CONSULTANTS OR ARE THEY ALL EMPLOYED BY ONE FIRM IS IN MULTIPLE FIRMS. W. S. P. USE YOU ESSAYS THE CONTRACT HOLDER BUT THEY THEY SUBCONTRACT WITH MANY OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMPANIES IN AND BRING STAFF AND AS NEEDED. OKAY AND HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THESE. RTP CONSULTANTS -- BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR COST OVERRUNS OR PROJECT DELAYS. NO SIR WE WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT THAT THE CONTRACT MANAGER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ITV CONTRACT OURS IS -- GENERALLY UNABLE TO PROVIDE A KIND BASIC FOUNDATIONAL EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE ALREADY PIECE PERFORMANCE -- FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD THE CONTACT MANAGER WASN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE TO RECOVER ANY OF THE ACTUAL WORK PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERABLES AT THE ALREADY P. REPORTED SUBMITTING. THE AUTHORITY. TO BE CLEAR THE THE RT P. REPORTS EMITTING IT OR NOT AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IN REACHING THAT DETERMINATION IS THE POOR DOCUMENTATION ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORITY. SO THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS REALLY IS IS THAT THE IF IT'S THE AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONSIBLY TO HOLD THAT CONTRACTOR ACCOUNTABLE. AS IT STANDS NOW WERE UNABLE TO REALLY WEIGH IN ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RDP ACCEPTING NOTING INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED -- DELAYS AND AND SOME COST OVERRUNS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR THEIR WORK PLANS I MEAN I LIKE I CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE THE NUMEROUS -- YOU KNOW. PASSAGES IN YOUR REPORT TO ARE YOU ARE YOU IDENTIFY THE THE THE SHORTCOMINGS IN TERMS OF THE DOCUMENTATION -- BUT I I DIDN'T SEE. ANYTHING IN TERMS OF WHETHER ANY OF THESE RTP CONSULTANTS. WERE FIRED OR CHANGED AS A RESULT OF ANY COST OVERRUNS OR ANY PROJECT IN PLACE. SO THE THE THE COMPOSITION OF THE RT. EMPLOYEE GROUP AS A WHOLE WILL BE IN MORE OR LESS CONSTANT FLUX BASED ON THAT THE AT THE NEEDS OF THE THIRTY THAT. THE THE THE CRISTINA FIRM AND AND SO FORTH -- IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PERFORMANCE SPECIFICALLY THOUGH KNOW HOW AS YOU SAID IN THE REPORT WE FOUND ONLY ONE INSTANCE -- AMONG NEAR YOU TO WORK PLANS AND AND THE AUTHORITY HAD EVER EVEN ISSUED. A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO THE RT P. FOR AND I WAS FOR AN I. T. DELIVERABLE THAT WAS MANY YEARS IN THE IN THE WAY IN THE MAKING AND HAVEN'T HAD SEEN MANY MANY OVERRUNS AND DELAYS SO. THERE'S BEEN. A GENERAL LACK OF OF DOCUMENTED ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOR BY THE AUTHORITY FOR ITS CONTRACTORS AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACTS THAT WE REVIEWED. SO FOR THIS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT -- THAT IF THERE IS NOT ONLY THE NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION OF THE THAT THAT THE NATURE AND THE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK BEING DONE. BUT THERE'S BEEN ONLY ONE CORRECTIVE ACTION ISSUED BY THE AUTHORITY OF FOR SUB. WHO UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE? THAT IS CORRECT SIR INSOFAR AS THE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IS IS A DOCUMENT OR THE RECOVERY PLAN THIS IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS A DOCUMENT. CONTEMPLATED BY THE POLICIES PROCEDURES TO THIRTY PUT IN PLACE THAT STATE STIPULATE TO THE CONTRACT MANAGER IF PERFORMANCES SIGNIFICANT BEHIND SCHEDULE OR OF A POOR QUALITY IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO WORK WITH THE CONTRACT TO IN. TWO TO TO DEVELOP THIS PLAN TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. OTHER WHAT WITH THE RISK BEING THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT YOU CONTINUE TO POTENTIALLY PAY MISTAKEN TEAMS TO PAY FOR SUB PAR OR OR DELINQUENT WORK -- I WILL SAY THAT. MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF OUR REVIEW OF THESE NINE CONTRACTS WE ALSO SELL ONLY LIMITED INSISTED INSTANCES IN WHICH CONTRACT MANAGERS HAD DISPUTED. ANY PORTION OF ANY INVOICE AND FURTHER WHEN WE WHEN WE INVESTIGATED THOSE INSTANCES THIS IS ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH PERHAPS THEIR CREDIT IN THIS CASE THE THE ORIGINS OF THOSE DISPUTES WERE ACTUALLY FROM THE RT P. CONSULTANTS IN THE FIELD WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTORS SO -- THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE HE CERTAINLY WE YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE STRONGLY AS THE AUTHORITIES YOU KNOW CLAIMS TO IN ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THOSE SORTS OF QUALITY ISSUES NEED TO FALL TO THIS THE STATE. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING CONTRACT. DID YOU SEE ANY -- I I I KNOW THAT ONE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS -- TO IS FOR THE AUTHORITY. TO OF DEVELOP AND AND FURTHER SPECIFY -- PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS -- FOR CONTRACTORS THAT DOES THAT INCLUDE THE RT P. CONSULTANTS. SO IF I'M CORRECT YOUR AB REFERRING TO THE RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE OKAY KIND OF LIKE IF CONTRACT MANAGERS THEMSELVES YEAH YEAH SO. THE THAT WOULD PERTAIN TO THE THE STATE EMPLOYEE THAT IS THE CONTRACT MANAGER FOR THAT CONTRACT TO FIX IT THAT IN THAT INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A CONTINUES. TO TO FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE WRITTEN RULE OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEN YES WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. WE WE BELIEVE THAT ASSOCIATED RECOMMENDATIONS SUCH AS ENSURING THAT DUTY STATEMENTS ALIGNED WITH WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO WILL WILL ASSIST THE AUTHORITY IN AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE WHICH AS WE AS WE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT TODAY HAS NOT HAPPENED. THE D. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE RDP CONSULTANTS. AS AN ANSWER WE WE WE DID WE DID NOT APART FROM THE THE FORMAL THE RARE FORMAL INTERVENTION THAT OCCURRED FOR ONE SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE AND THAT WAS AND REALLY LIMITED IN IN TERMS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE. TO TO THE CREATION OF THAT RECOVERY PLAN BY WHICH THE RT P. HAD -- TO EXES SPECIFY HOW WOULD HOW WOULD ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN ITS WORK IN THAT AREA. EARLIER MR FONG ASK A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS TYPICAL OR NOT -- YOU KNOW THE FOR THIS LEVEL OF MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND BEING. I I BELIEVE -- MS HOW YOU YOU ANSWERED IT IT'S NOT TYPICAL TO RELY SO MUCH ON OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS BUT I MEAN IS [inaudible] WE'RE IT TO HELP US COMMITTEE TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THE I MEAN YOU KNOW IT IS IS IS IS PAR FOR THE COURSE OF WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT IN IN IN TERMS OF PUBLIC PROJECTS OF THE SCALE OR ADD. YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT THE BRIDGE PROJECT IS A THE THE TOLL BRIDGE PROJECT AS AS ONE YOU KNOW A GOOD COMPARISON BUT IS THE DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY OF OPINION AS TO WELL AS I INDICATED -- MISTER MURATSUCHI AND AND RESPONSE TO MR FUNG'S QUESTION THE THE THE VOLUME AND THE THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES THAT WE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN WE TYPICALLY SEE IN AN ARTICLE OFTENTIMES A FOR GOING IN AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WORK AND WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE DOCTOR. IMITATION BUT MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES IN THIS SITUATION IT WAS. MULTIPLE INSTANCES AND NUMEROUS FOR EXAMPLE MISTER -- MISTER REINER YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RTP CONSULTANTS AND THEY WERE THEY WORK I'M GONNA READ FROM MY NOTES BUT WE REVIEWED -- A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR DELIVERABLES THAT RT P. CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD PROVIDED TO THE AUTHORITY THE AUTHORITY WAS MISSING A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ANY EVIDENCE OF COMPLETION OF THOSE. PARTICULAR DELIVERABLES -- FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOSE IN THE STATE YOU KNOW THE PAYMENT TO RT P. WAS CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO A PROJECT OF THIS SIGNIFICANCE WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. TIGHTER CONTROLS STRONGER OVERSIGHT BETTER FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY ON ON THEIR BEHALF OF THAT ARE THE AUTHORITY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE JUST NOT SEEING THAT -- AND IT IS IT IS CONCERNING BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF THE DOLLARS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE TYPICALLY SEE IN OTHER AUDITS -- CERTAINLY AUDITS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT ARE NOT OF THIS PARTICULAR MAGNITUDE AS FAR AS THE INVESTMENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO YOU SAY YOU HAVE DOCUMENTED -- TO NUMEROUS -- INCIDENCE OF THE LACK OF THESE CONTROLS AND THE LACK OF TRANS -- BASED ON YOUR OVERALL -- EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AUDIT AS WELL AS YOUR PRIOR AUDIT -- ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO WHY THIS APPEARS TO BE. THE CASE BOY THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT IT IT IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PAST THE THEIR OWN INTERNAL AUDITORS I THINK HAVING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL PARTICIPATE AS FAR AS AN EXTERNAL ENTITY -- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE I REALLY DON'T KNOW QUITE FRANKLY -- WHY THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO BRING ON? STATE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE -- OVERSIGHT IN PARTICULAR AREAS I KNOW MISTER MISTER FRAZIER MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE PROJECT OR SOMEBODY MAY NOT GOING TO WANT TO WORK. FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BECAUSE IT'S A LIMITED TERM COMPOSITION BUT WE'RE TALKING WE'RE TALKING OUT -- TO TWENTY THIRTY THERE HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE WORKED IN EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT POSITIONS FOR THE AUTHORITY FOR YEARS NOW SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THE AUTHORITY CAN PUT FORTH -- WITH RESPECT TO BRINGING ON STATE EMPLOYEES AND HAVING MORE OF A STATE OVERSIGHT -- STRUCTURE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION AS TO WHY -- MORE. INSTANCES OF RTP CONSULTANTS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE COST OF RENTS FOR THE PROJECT IN THE I I I WOULD DEFER TO THE AUTHORITY I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PERSPECTIVE MAY BE I MEAN WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND I CAN DIFFER STAFF WE'VE HEARD. THIS FROM THE AUTHORITY OFTENTIMES STATE PROJECTS BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS WE'VE SEEN THIS AND I. T. PROJECTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND OTHER REPORTS AND YOU BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS ARE OUTSIDE VENDORS. THAT YOUR YOUR RELUCTANT TO KIND OF CUT THE CORD AND TAKE OVER THE PROJECT OR CERTAINLY HAVE MORE OF A STATE ROLE SO I DON'T KNOW AGAIN I'LL DEFER TO THE AUTHORITY. ALLOW MY STAFF TO ANSWER IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD BUT I THINK IT IS CONCERN ABOUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THIS PROJECT GOING WE'VE GOT A DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE SOME. LANGUAGE IN THE REPORT WHERE. THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD WAS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL GRANT BUT WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE VOTERS WHO APPROVED PROPOSITION THE BONDS. THAT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IT IT IS RAIL IF YOU START SEEING CONSTRUCTION IN. CONCRETE ON THE GROUND IT CETERA SO I THINK I THINK THAT SOME OF THE PERSPECTIVE PERHAPS AT THE AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE I DON'T KNOW STAFF HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. BOBBI ASKING THE SAME QUESTION TO THE THIRTY IN A FEW MINUTES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YES MISS PATTERSON. DID DID I HEAR ACCURATELY THAT. FUTURE POTENTIAL CHANGE BORDERS COULD BE IN THE MAGNITUDE OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. AS ONE OF AT BASED ON THE MOST RECENT AND HE'S OUR POINT IN TIME CALCULATIONS OF COURSE WHAT DURING THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION. LET THAT SINK INVOKES SHARON FRAZIER. JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON ANOTHER QUESTION. I DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HSR HIGH SPEED REAL CAN I IMPLEMENT ALL THE PROVISIONS. IN THE BALLOT MEASURE ON PROP ONE NAY -- THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR AND WAS JUST FOLLOW THAT UP WITH. WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING IF THEY CAN ATTAIN THESE PROVISIONS? YEAH WOOD MISTER FRAZIER WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT PROPOSITION ONE A AND COMPARED IT TO WHAT WE SAW AS FAR AS PROGRESS THE AUTHORITY HAD MADE SO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I APOLOGIZE. THE OTHER WAS THAT IN THE IN THE BALLOT [inaudible] FOR NOT. A PRICE THAT WAS SET FOR FAIR. FOR THE FARE TO RIDE THE HE OR WAS IT IN SOME KIND OF DOCUMENT SAID THAT WHAT IT WOULD COST RIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL. WHAT IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE COST WOULD BE NOW IT IN TODAY'S DOLLARS I'M HERE IS ALMOST DOUBLED? I AGAIN WOULD WHEN I'M LOOKING AT STAFF AND THERE'S THERE TELL ME WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO AGAIN I WOULD DEFER TO THE AUTHORITY FOR THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF THE SAYING IS AFFORDABLE DRUG. YOU KNOW TO WRITE ON IT MOVES FORWARD [inaudible] YES. ON THE LAST POINT WHERE YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE TO TRY TO SHOW SOMETHING. TO DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING VISIBLE ON PAGE THIRTY DIGITAL TRIGGERED THIS THAT YOU YOU RIGHT. OR IN THE AUDIT THAT STORY REPORTED TOTAL COST ESTIMATES WHEN BEGINNING CONSTRUCTION IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WERE UNREASONABLY LOW CAN YOU EXPOUND ON HOW YOU CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION SO IS UNDER THAT WITH DID DID THEY KNOW THE ROUTE BUT THE COSTS WERE LOW AND THEY JUST SAID IT ANYWAYS. WHAT SERVER THEY CERTAINLY KNEW WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO PLACE RELIABLE DOLLAR MONTH ON THOSE COSTS THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT WE REFER TO IN THE REPORT FOR POINT OF COMPARISON? HAVE TO DO WITH THOSE IN THE THE CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER OF PROVISIONAL SUMS UP THE AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED WHEN EXECUTING EACH OF THE THREE CONTRACTS. WE COMPARED THOSE TO THE THAT CHANGES TO DATE THE COSTS OF RUN TODAY AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSION ABOUT. THE ON RECENTLY LOW NATURE OF OF THE WRITTEN OUR POINT ABOUT THE ON REASON THIS THOSE NUMBERS IS REALLY ROOTED IN. AUTHORITIES KNOW IN KNOWN UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING -- THESE ISSUES AND THAT. THEY COULDN'T PUT A GOOD NUMBER ON THEM BUT IT'S LED TO FORGIVE ME BUT IF IT'S ONE THING TO SAY I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY I DON'T KNOW BUT THIS IS THE NUMBER. CORRECT. I WOULD AGREE INSOFAR AS YES THEY THEY PUT OUT A THEY PUT OUT A SEVERAL CONTRACTS WITH A CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS THAT WERE INADEQUATE SO. SO THE NUMBER THEY PUT OUT. WAS JUSTIFIED HOUSE IF THEY DON'T KNOW THE INFORMATION -- THAT'S A QUESTION I CAN ASK THE DOOR TO BE I WAS THE FOR THE AUTHORITY ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY FOR SAID THEY HAVE A WRIST THEY HAD A RISK ASSESSMENT. PROCESS BUT BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION IN VARIOUS SPORT YOU KNOW FORMS THAT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE THE INPUT TO THE SYSTEM. WAS INCOMPLETE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD DEFEND THE OUTPUTS BUT AGAIN I WOULD I WOULD FOR THEM FOR THE METHODOLOGIES THANK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAY NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT TO LIKE TO INVITE. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ALL RIGHT WELCOME GENTLEMEN -- YOU -- LIKE AS I INDICATED TO THE AUDITOR AND HER STAFF A YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MINUTES TO MAKE A OPEN PRESENTATION AND WE LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] NINETY DEGREE. NOW I'M HERE WITH. YOU CAN PULL THE THE MICHAEL OF A CLOSER YEAH -- AT THE TABLE WITH. ACTIONS. WHO IS OUR A YEAR AGO? THANK YOU. I WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND IT'S BEEN WITH THIS SENSE -- FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE IT'S STILL GOOD MORNING -- CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN MARZUKI CHU CHI. CHI. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS TOM RICHARDS. I'M VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD. I ALSO SERVE AS SERVE ON THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. WITH ITS CHAIR MIKE ROSSI. A SUBCOMMITTEE OF TO TO THE FULL BOARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THIS COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING OFF FUNDING AND FINANCE FINANCIAL MATTERS BUDGETS [inaudible] EXPENDITURES. PERFORMANCE METRICS IN REVIEWING AUDITS. AND OUR RESPONSES TO THEM. SUCH AS THE ONE WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. I'VE SERVED ON THE BOARD SINCE DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT'S IMPORTANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S MOBILITY AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO DELIVER THE SYSTEM. A HIGH LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT IS APPROPRIATE TO HELP US IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE. WE WELCOME THE AUDIT. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WE AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MOVING SWIFTLY TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THEM. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU. WITH SOME IMPORTANT CONTEXT. SYSTEM TO SOME THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. AS YOU KNOW. THE AUTHORITIES CHALLENGES BEEN TO OF ALL THIS ORGANIZATION. AND IMPROVE ITS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES. AND AT THE SAME TIME. TO TO BEGIN DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL TO CALIFORNIA. WHEN PROPOSITION ONE A PASSED? THERE WERE ABOUT TEN TEN STATE EMPLOYEES WORKING FOR THE AUTHORITY. AND THEY'RE WORTH SEVENTEEN AS I RECALL WHEN I JOIN THE BOARD AND TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE'VE GROWN TO APPROXIMATELY FIFTY STATE EMPLOYEES. CURRENTLY THERE IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT STAFF. WORKING ON THE PROGRAM. THOSE ARE STATE EMPLOYEES. I THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BY DESIGN. WE DO NOT INTEND TO ESTABLISH A LARGE STATE OR ORGANIZATION BECAUSE WE ARE SINGLE PURPOSE AGENCY WHOSE SOLE MISSION. IS TO BUILD HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH WILL THEN BE OPERATED. AND MAINTAINED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT IS A PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATOR [inaudible] THAT SAID. AS WE'VE CONTINUED TO GROW TO OUR CURRENT STAFFING LEVEL. WE'VE HAD TO QUICKLY TRANSITION FROM A VERY SMALL PLANNING AGENCY. TO AN EFFECTIVE PROJECT DELIVERY ORGANIZATION. WE'VE WORKED TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE THROUGH. A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. THE AUDIT REAFFIRMS SEVERAL ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR INTERNAL REVIEWS. IT OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND BUILD UPON. ACTIONS WE'VE BEGUN IMPLEMENTING. WE ARE NOW PROCEEDING TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN AND SOLIDIFY OUR EFFORTS TO EXPEDITE. THE ORGANIZATIONS TRANSITION TO A FULLY INTEGRATED PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT DELIVERY ORGANIZATION. BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF SOME ISSUE DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ADDITIONAL CONTEXT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE AUTHORITIES DECISION. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CONSTRUCTION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN IT DID. THIS IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE DISCUSSED. IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE AUDIT REPORT. SPECIFICALLY THE AUDIT REPORT CHARACTERIZES THIS IS FLAWED DECISION MAKING. AND CONCLUDES THAT OUR DECISION RESULTED IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF COST OVERRUNS. AS I HOPE TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU TODAY IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM. WE BELIEVE THE DECISIONS WE MADE REFLECTED CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. OF HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE. OF THE FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS WHILE ALSO MANAGING MYRIAD RISKS WE FACED. AS THE AUDIT NOTES IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE AUTHORITY SECURE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL. AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT. FUNDS FOLLOWED BY AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION. IN FEDERAL FISCAL -- TWO THOUSAND TEN TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT GRANT FUNDS. THE OUR A STIMULUS. CAME WITH A PRESCRIPTION FOR HOW WHERE AND WHEN AND THE DOLLARS. WERE TO BE SPENT. THE PORTION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS WERE TO BE DIRECTED TO COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS FOR THE ENTIRE FACE ONE SYSTEM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM. HOWEVER MOST OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS APPROXIMATELY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED. FOR STARTING CONSTRUCTION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS WAS DONE AT A TIME TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHEN CALIFORNIA HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF TWELVE POINT 4%. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY FARED MUCH WORSE. WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE APPROACHING 17%. IN ADDITION. THE OUR FINDS CAME WITH THE CLEAR STATUTORY DEADLINE. THAT THEY'D BE FULLY EXPANDED BY SEPTEMBER. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ANY REMAINING UNSPENT BALANCE. OF THESE ARE A FUNDS WOULD NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA. SUBSEQUENTLY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THREE SENATE BILL. TEN TWENTY NINE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IN PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDS TO MATCH THE FEDERAL ARE. IN FY TEN FUNDS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH PROPOSITION. ONE EIGHTY AND THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING FUNDS. THIS ALLOWED CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE AUDIT REPORT QUESTIONS THE AUTHORITY'S DECISION TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION. DESPITE NOT HAVING A SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTED FOR KNOWN RISKS. WHEN THE AUTHORITY MADE THE DECISION TO START CONSTRUCTION? AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE DID SO WITH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. THAT IT CAME WITH A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNS AND RISKS FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS. AS OUR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN NOTED. SOME OF THESE RISKS WERE REALIZED. AND WE DEVOTED A FULL CHAPTER IN DISCUSSING THEIR IMPACT. ON OUR PROGRAM COST AND SCHEDULE IDEALLY. WE WOULD HAVE MOVED INTO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WITH PRELIMINARY PLANNING COMPLETE. MAJOR THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. UTILITY RELOCATIONS IDENTIFIED. AND A RIGHT OF WAY ACTIVE ACQUISITION UNDER WAY. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE AND OTHER PROJECT ELEMENTS WERE MORE TO FIND. COSTED AND INCORPORATED IN THE PROJECT BUDGET. THE AUTHORITY MADE THE DECISION TO ACCEPT THE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS AND BEGIN BUILDING HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE WAIT THIS DECISION AGAINST THE RISKS. THAT CAME WITH MOVING TO CONSTRUCTION EARLY. INSTEAD OF DEFERRING. CONSTRUCTION UNTIL ALL COSTS WERE BETTER DEFINE. DIFFERING CONSTRUCTION MEANT TURNING AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS AND FOR GOING PROPOSITION ONE A REQUIRED MATCHING FUNDS. AT THAT TIME AS YOU KNOW CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WERE NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT. THESE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS THERE WAS NO HOPE OF STARTING CONSTRUCTION UNLESS AND UNTIL THE AUTHORITY COULD SECURE AND OTHER SOURCES MATCHING FUNDS. WE BELIEVE THE BENEFITS OF PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. AT A TIME OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF ADDITIONAL COSTS. THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED. THAT BELIEF HAS BEEN VALIDATED BECAUSE THE BENEFITS OF MOVING FORWARD. ARE BEING REALIZED. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND JOB YEARS HAVE BEEN GENERATED AND AN ESTIMATED SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN ECONOMIC IMPACT HIS RIPPLED ACROSS THE STATE SINCE DECEMBER SKEWS ME AS OF DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH. FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES WERE WORKING ON THE PROGRAM. AS THIS TO AS OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN AND THOUGH HAVE THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES. AND FIFTY TWO WERE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. AS OF OCTOBER 312-000-1820 FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX SIXTY SIX CRAP CAPTAIN SKEWS ME CRAFT LABORS. HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO WORK ON OUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY [inaudible] HOWEVER. AS THE AUDIT REPORTS NOTES OUR ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIS INCREASED. IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOLLOWING A COMPREHENSIVE COST REVIEW DIRECTED BY THE THE BOARDS FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATE FROM SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. ESTABLISHED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWO TEN POINT SIX BILLION. THE RESULTS ARE THIS REPRESENTS A NEW ESTIMATE COMPLETION FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. WE INCORPORATED THIS UPDATED ESTIMATE IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. AND THE BOARD ADOPTED. TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PROGRAM BASELINE WHICH SETS THE SCOPE SCHEDULE AND BUDGET REQUIRED TO DELIVER THE GOALS SET IN THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS PLAN. THESE RICH NEW ESTIMATE IS WHAT IS YOUR REFLECTED IN THE AUDIT REPORT AND INCLUDES FULLY ASSIGNED COSTS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED. FOR THE MOST PART IT RESENT REPRESENTS COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BUDGETED EARLIER IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE. A MORE -- OUR COMPLETE MORE OF THE PRE REQUISITE WORK THAT IS IDEALLY DOWN CONSTRUCTION STARTS. INSTEAD THE PREVIOUSLY UNDEFINED RISK COSTS HAVE NOW BEEN BUDGETED FOR IN OUR NEW ESTIMATED COMPLETION. THE AUDIT REPORT FOR THE NEW ESTIMATE AT COMPLETE SKEWS ME THE AUDIT REPORTS STATES THAT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY CONSTRUCTION. CONTRIBUTED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CHANGES TO CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND THAT FINISHING THE CONSTRUCTION. THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY WILL REQUIRE IN ANOTHER ANOTHER ONE POINT SIX BILLION. THESE AMOUNTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND ARE NOW BEING MANAGED THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PROGRAM BASS LINE MOST OF THE COST CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 80%. RESULT IN THE VARIOUS SCOPE CHANGES DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ADVANCING THE RAILROAD AGREEMENTS UTILITY RELOCATIONS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS. AND SOME REFLECT NEW SCOPE WHICH INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS RESULTING FROM THE BOARD'S DECISION. TO EXTEND CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. ONE NORTH BY THREE MILES. TO REITERATE THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCOPE CHANGES. REPRESENT RISKS WE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE INITIATED CONSTRUCTION. BUT HAD NOT FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR PROJECT BUDGET. AND WERE HIGHER THAN THE CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS THAT WE HAD ESTABLISHED. THEY HAVE NOW BEEN FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BASELINE. THE REMAINING 20% IN COSTS. CHANGES REFLECT TO ADDITIONAL COST CATEGORIES. THE FIRST HIS MISCELLANEOUS SCOPE CHANGES THAT ARE NOT NEATLY CAPTURED AND RAILROAD OR THIRD PARTY AND UTILITY RELOCATION SCOPE CHANGES. THESE INCLUDE FOR ECSTATIC FOR EXAMPLE COSTS. AND DESIGN CHANGES. THE SECOND CATEGORY REFLECTS BOTH ACTUAL THAT'S APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE DELAY COST. WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE COSTS ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION DELAYS DUE TO LITIGATION. AND CONSEQUENTIAL AGE IN ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY. THE RIGHT OF WAY ACTUALLY ACT ACQUISITION DELAYS WERE IN PART DRIVEN. BY PROPOSITION ONE A LITIGATION AND TEMPER TEMPORARILY BLOCKED ACCESS TO THESE PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDS AND REQUIRED RENEGOTIATION. OF TERMS IN OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWED THE EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS. BEFORE STATE MATCHING FUNDS. ALL OF THE LITIGATION RELATED DELAYED COSTS. WE'RE OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE AUTHORITY. HOWEVER THE AUTHORITY TOOK A NUMBER OF MEASURES. TO MANAGE THESE DELAYS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING THAT CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE ONE CONTRACTOR BE ONLY LIMITED -- NOTICES HIT WAS THREE WAS GIVEN A ONLY A LIMITED NOTICE TO PROCEED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL OF HIGHER DELAY COSTS. BASED ON THIS NEW A BASED ON THIS NEW ESTIMATE COMPLETION THE AUTHORITY COULD POTENTIALLY ANCHOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL DELAY COST IF IT OCCURS. IT WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. BASED ON THIS WE CANNOT AGREE THAT THERE HAS BEEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COST OVERRUNS. WE UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT QUESTION THE DECISION. BUT WE BELIEVE OUR DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CONSTRUCTION. TO HAVE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES OF CONSTRUCTION UNDER WAY. AN THE A CAN ECONOMIC BENEFITS YIELDED SO FAR WAS NOT FLY FLIED. BUT INAPPROPRIATE AND WELL REASONED DECISION GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE. WAS TO LEAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS ON THE TABLE AND SHOW WE STAND BY. OUR DECISION. THE SECOND CHAPTER IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS AN EVALUATION OF THE AUTHORITIES CONTRACT MANAGEMENT THE REPORT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AUTHORITY. HAS ADOPTED CONTACT MANAGER POLICIES TO HELP INSURE IT MONITORS CONTRACTS AND CONTROL AND CONTROL COSTS. HOWEVER IT AGAIN OF VICE CONCERNS. WITH OUR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE. DOCUMENTATION OVERSIGHT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR POLICIES. THE AUTHORITY HAS RECOGNIZED THESE ISSUES. THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN DISCUSSED ADDING CONTRACT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE AND EXPANDING PROJECT CONTROLS. BOTH IN THE FIELD AND AT THE PROGRAM LEVEL. THOSE EFFORTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BUT AS JUST THE AUDIT FOUND SOME OR NOT CONSISTENTLY FOLLOWED. AND IN SOME CASES FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE OUR PROCEDURES ARE SOUND WE HAVE NOT CONSISTENTLY FOLLOWED THEM BY FULLY DOCUMENTING. THE NECESSITY OF THE WORK WE'VE REQUESTED OF ARE CONTRACTORS. OR DOCUMENTING THAT THE WORK THAT WAS COMPLETED WAS APPROPRIATE. AND OF HIGH QUALITY. WE HAVE INSTITUTED CORRECTIVE MEASURES AROUND THAT TO INSURE THAT THESE ARE FULLY DOCUMENTED GOING FORWARD. THE AUTHORITY WILL IMPLEMENT THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA. TO FULLY EXECUTE OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THROUGH A STRONGER AND EXPANDED INTERNAL AUG AUDIT PROGRAM. THAT REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS WILL INCLUDE REQUIRING ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE TRAIN CONTRACT MANAGERS. MANAGEMENT STAFF AS WELL AS PROVIDING GREATER OVERSIGHT THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW OF CONTRACT FILES IN IDENTIFYING GAPS. IN NECESSARY OCCM DOCUMENTATION. THE AUTHORITY WILL ALSO INCREASE THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AUDIT STAFF. IN ADDITION. THE AUTHORITY IS REVIEWING OPTIONS FOR A DESK TOP AUDIT SOLUTION THAT WILL PROVIDE A CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY. TO HELP INSURE CONTRACT MANAGERS CLIENTS WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE AUTHORITY WILL THROUGH PERIODIC REPORTING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. SHARE OUR PROGRESS. IN IMPLEMENTING ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE OTHER MEASURES. WE ARE UNDER TAKING TO IMPROVE OUR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BURDEN IS ON US TO PROPERLY DEMONSTRATE. THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE PROVIDED ARE PROVIDING GOOD VALUE TO THE STATE. THE THIRD CHAPTER IN THE AUDIT REPORT MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE AUTHORITIES MONITORING. AND REPORTING OF KEY GOALS. THESE INCLUDE ARE INVENTED Và IRON MENTAL SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY AND SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED VANTAGE BUSINESS UTILIZATION GOALS. THE AUTHORITY HAS COMPREHENSIVE HINGED SUSTAINABILITY. PROGRAM. EXCUSE ME. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DONE THIS BY THE WAY. AND I'VE GOT A MOUTH FULL OF COTTON. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A BENEFIT FOR YOU THAT I'VE NOT DONE THIS OR WHETHER IT'S IT'S A RELIEF. SHOW. THE THIRD CHAPTER IN THE AUDIT MAKES -- IN THE AUDIT REPORT MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY PARENTS HE OF THE AUTHORITIES MONITORING. AND REPORTING OF KEY GOALS THESE INCLUDE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZATION PROGRAMS. AND THEIR GOALS THE AUTHORITY HAS A COMPREHENSIVE STATE ST SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE. NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GASES COMMIT OR EMISSIONS. AND USE CLEAN POWER IN OPERATIONS WE ESTABLISH WE APPRECIATE THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE BETTER ALIGN OUR POLICIES WITH HOW WE COLLECT INVALIDATE DATA. TO MAKE EFFECTIVELY. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TRACK OUR PROGRESS IN THIS AREA SIMILARLY. THE AUTHORITIES ESTABLISH TITLES FOR SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS REALIZATION TO HELP CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY PARTICULARLY. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE WILL EXPAND AND CLARIFY ARE REPORTING IN THAT AREA IS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDIT. WE ARE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT THE AUDIT REPORT FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITY. FOLLOWED INDUSTRIES STANDARDS. IN ESTIMATION OF AN ACT OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF ITS SPENDING ON IT CONTRACTING AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE REPORT NOTED THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER OR OVER STATED. IN CLOSING. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AUDIT AS REQUESTED BY ASSEMBLY MANNER MEMBER PATTERSON AND SENATORS SHOULD BE ALL OUR SKEWS ME THEY'LL. AND ARAMBULA AND PRIOR AUDITS HAVE ASSISTED THE AUTHORITY. IN IMPROVING OPERATIONS AND MAKING OUR WORK MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC. WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS CURRENT AUDIT TO STRENGTHEN ADMINISTRATION. OF THE PROGRAM AS CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES ON THIS TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND AS THE BOOK AND PROJECTS ADVANCE IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THAT CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT IN THE BAY AREA. AND THE UP CAME COMING LINK US UNION STATION PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES. I WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU. I AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER CHAIRMAN.

BUT WE REARRANGE THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION TO TRANSCEND IT FROM A WILL WAS FIND AS A PLANNING ORGANIZATION. TO PREDOMINATELY A PROGRAM TO LIVE FOR OFFICES TOWARDS THAT DELIVERY. AS A RESULT OF THAT WHAT YOU'LL SEE. BROUGHT THE HORTON THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION IS IT EMPHASIS NOW YEAH. YES YES ARE A IN AND OUT TO GET ME THE STRUCTURE. WE HAVE THAT STRUCTURE SIR. AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE THE THE THE PMP WHICH IS THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH WAS JUST WRITTEN AND APPROVED. OKAY YEAH. LIKE HOW MANY POSITIONS OR FILL HOW MANY POSITIONS ARE VAGUE AND THAT IS ALL DOCUMENTS SIR IN THAT IN OUR PMP AND IN OUR OR TRUCKS OKAY IS THAT IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUTO. SIR I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE AUDITOR REVIEWED WITH REGARDS TO WE PRESENTED OUR ORGANIZATION CHART AND OUR PMP SO -- I WOULD WHAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS IS JAIL NASSER THE QUESTION YEAH.

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND -- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A STRUCTURE. THAT COMPLIES WITH THE AUDIT. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING JUST A CHART. INTO YOU HAVE THE POSITIONS FILLED AND THE QUALIFIED PEOPLE. IN IN -- THOSE POSITIONS. CORRECT. YEAH SO LIKE WHAT I WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET FROM YOU IS. HAVE YOU GOT TWO THIRDS OF THAT DON HALF OF IT -- THREE QUARTERS -- HOW MANY OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE VACANT HOW MANY OF OUR OR HAVE OF YOU YET TO DETERMINE -- ANY ADDITIONAL FOG QUALITY CD THOSE POSITIONS HOW MUCH MORE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO ON THE ORGANIZATION. CHART THE TO DO. THE INITIAL -- OR A REORGANIZATION WAS COMPLETED -- AND IT WAS COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE TIME OF OF SEEING THE ARCTIC CAT RECOMMENDATIONS. SO THAT IS UNDER UNDER WAY ESTIMATE WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE BY. THE FIRST OF THE YEAR YES SIR. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE -- THIRTY EIGHT VACANCIES RIGHT. YES SIR. WHAT KIND OF CATEGORIES? THEREFORE DONLEY SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION. BUT AGAIN ISN'T MAJORITY OF THOSE I WOULD SAY PREDOMINANTLY AT MY I HAVE SKILLED TRY TO REFRESH MYSELF SIR BUT AGAIN IS. FROM AN EARLY AND ADMINISTRATION TYPE POSITIONS ON MY OVERLY EXECUTIVE LEVEL -- TALK MANAGER -- TALK -- PROJECT MANAGEMENT DECISIONS STAR HAD TO GET OUT THE ORG CHART WHAT LET'S GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT OKAY -- SO I WITH THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF I WANT I WANT TO GET IT IS NOT. WHO'S IN CHARGE. WHAT THEY'RE MANAGING -- DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S A DIFFICULTY HIRING QUALIFIED STAFF -- IN TERMS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE OR WHAT BARRIERS. YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. SENATOR BILL I THINK THAT JUST A BASED UPON MY OWN EXPENSE VARIANCE IN ESPECIALLY WITH FINANCE AND AUDIT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- WE'VE ALWAYS ENDED UP RECEIVING THAT THERE'S A DIFFICULT TIME AND HIRING -- IT'S INTERESTING I WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ENDEMIC STATEWIDE WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE TOLD. IS THAT ARE VACANCY FACTORS ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER AGENCIES WHICH IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO ME AN ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE OUR STATE GOVERNMENT THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH SO -- IF YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POSITIONS -- I'M QUESTIONING OF ON A REASONABLY FREQUENT RATIONS WHY AREN'T THEY FILLED. AND BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE WE'VE CONCLUDED IT THEY'RE NOT FILLED. BUT WE'RE CONCERT WE ARE BASICALLY CONSISTENT WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THE STATE WHICH IS AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER TO US -- HOW WE RE ALLOCATE? POSITIONS IN TWO OTHERS THAT WE FIND MORE CRITICAL IS THE QUESTION WE'VE ASKED FOR INSTANCE. IN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. SO -- WE I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT IS THE THERE ARE ISN'T TALENT IN THE STATE. IT'S WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN AT JUST HOW WE ARE. HOW THE US PHYSICIANS THAT WE HAVE WERE DESIGNATED IF WE CAN RE ALLOCATE THOSE POSITIONS AREAS THAT WE FEEL ARE MORE CRITICAL TO THE FILM AND OF THE OF THE -- PROJECT. SO HERE AND COMPETITION WITH ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE HIRING PEOPLE. KIND OF WHAT YOU HAVE A UNIQUE JOB WHICH IS KIND OF OFF. LIKE IF I WAS AN ENGINEER OR PROJECT MANAGER I CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE THIS JOB ON MY RESUME I MEAN I THINK IT. WE HAVE SOME ATTRACTION. BUT THE QUESTION IS -- DO YOU HAVE TO WHEN YOU SAY TO CIVIL SERVICES THAT INCLUDE THE SAME SALARY. LEVEL IS A SALARY. YES LEVEL AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE STATE'S HOURS ARE WAY LOWER THAN -- DISPARITIES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRANSIT AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE THING. WE HAVE RIGHT NOW MORE THAN. THEN -- LIKE A CALTRANS DIRECTOR GETS THE SAME PAY IS A MID SIZE CITY AND MY PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR IN MY AREA. SO. WE COULD DO -- WITH WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE HAVE -- I THINK TODAY WE HAVE FORTY NINE CONTRACT MANAGERS. EVERY CONTRACT WE MET MANAGER WE HAVE IS A STATE EMPLOYEE OKAY GOOD. OKAY I THINK I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT ISSUE IF YOU WANT TO RAMP UP THOUSAND GET THE POSITIONS FILLED YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE. TO YEAH PAY THEM ADEQUATELY COMPETITIVE. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CIVIL SERVICE. I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING THE DAUGHTERS RECOMMENDATION HAVING A TEAM. DAD HAS CONTINUITY THAT STICKS TOGETHER. THAT BECOMES -- THE KNOWLEDGE CENTER OF THE PROJECT. TERMS OF MANAGING AND CONSTRUCTING THE PROJECT. HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE CENTER SO IMPORTANT IN COMPLETING A PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. SO IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE COME COMPETITION ON THE SALARIES. THAT THAT THAT'S AN UNFAIR VERY FOR YOU. YEAH AND I THINK -- TO ME THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. IT IN A GREEN WITH THE RECOMMENDATION WE WANT THAT TEAM TO STICK TOGETHER. THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT SO. I I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A WASTE. ACCOMPLISH WHAT I TRYING TO SAY -- IN TERMS OF STICKING THAT MAKING THAT THOSE PEOPLE STAY. AND AND BECOME THE KNOWLEDGE CENTER FOR AND AND URGENCY CENTER FOR THE PROJECT. YES SURE YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP HIGHER CANCELED BECAUSE THEY COMMON GOAL TO LEAVE. YOUR FULL. CONTROL AND I THINK THE AUTHORS CORRECT BECAUSE THE LESS. LESS OF A SENSE OF URGENCY ON THE PROJECT. WE CREATED SERVE -- LESS IF. YOU DON'T HAVE THE SENSE OF URGENCY MAYBE A NEW. WE HAVE A TEAM. AND SEE IF YOU CREATE A GOOD TEAM. WITH GOOD TEAM LEADERS NIGHT. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL THING. THE GUTS OF THE AUTUMN MY PAIN. COMMITTEE CAME DOWN COMMITTEE STAFF -- TO TAKE OF A LOOK AT IT I WAS DOWN THERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- DURING A PROCESS TO SO I APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A DAY AT THIS TIME AND SHOW MY STAFF WHAT'S GOING ON IN REAL TIME -- MISTER RICHARDS IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU SAID YOUR DECISION TO START CONSTRUCTION WAS THE DELIVER WELL THOUGHT OUT DECISION. YET IN THE AUDIT -- THE AUTO QUOTE YOUR CHIEF ENGINEERS ST MOTIVATING FACTOR WAS THE DESIRE TO SHOW PROGRESS BECAUSE OUTSIDE GROUP FOR TRYING TO STOP THE PROJECT. EXPLAIN THIS DISCONNECT -- I'M NOT YOU KNOW I QUESTIONS. AT THAT -- INTERVIEW WITH OUR CHIEF ENGINEER. AND THE AUDITOR AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS CAPTURED -- THE WAY HE INTENDED IT BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU IT WASN'T -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE. BY THE BOARD WAS NOT IN RESPONSE AN OVERRIDING SENSE THAT WE HAD TO SHOW PROGRESS. THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY THE BOARD WAS. WAS CAPTURED IN THE OVER RIDING. CONCERN ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND FACED WITH THE LOSS OF THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING. SO LOOKING BACK ON THAT DECISION THAT YOU MADE NOW AND GET THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF THE OPTICS. THAT IT WAS -- A MISTAKE. BASED ON THE ABILITY TO GET RIGHT AWAY AND WHAT NOT -- WHAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE? WELL -- MISTER FRAZIER. WHEN I DO WHEN I GO BACK AND I LOOK AT ALL THE NUMBERS YET? WE GOT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND I LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF COST. OTHER TH A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE THAT WE ARE BEING CONSIDERED COST OVER RUNS. A REALLY UNDEFINED CAUGHT UNDEFINED AT THE TIME -- SCOPE. WHICH WAS ON KNOWN. YES PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS OF THIRD PARTY AND RIGHT AND RIGHT OF WAY AMONG A COUPLE OR THREE OTHERS -- WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE THE BALK OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BUT THOSE THOSE COSTS IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO BE DEFINED AT THE OUTSET. WOULD HAVE BEEN CAN WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COST AS OPPOSED TO DATE -- CHARACTERIZATION AND THAT THEIR OVER RUNS WE KNEW THEY WERE THERE WE ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM WITH PROVISIONAL FUNDING CONTINGENCY WE CLEARLY UNDER ESTIMATED BOTH. CONTINUE CONTINGENCY FUNDS PROVISIONAL FUNDS. THAT AND THE S. WE AS THE CONTRACTS IN THE AGREEMENTS WITH OUR THIRD PARTY -- PARTNERS -- AS WELL AS UTILITY RELOCATIONS BECAMEMORE -- COULD HELP CLEAR -- WE INCORPORATED DOES IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN PLAN. THE THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE TIME WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION. AND INTO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TIME FRAME WE'RE PRETTY COMPLEX -- WITH A LOT OF PUSHING AND PULLING WITH REGARDS TO WHAT. THE THIRD PARTY PARTNERS ARE AT CONTRACTORS ARE THE THIRD PARTY -- AGREEMENTS THAT IF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE AGREEMENTS WANTED -- INTRUSION BERRIES WERE ONE OF ROACH. SHOW -- THEY WEREN'T THINGS THAT WE COULD EITHER ONE DIVINE DEFINED CLEARLY BEFORE NOW. AND SECONDLY WITHOUT QUESTION. THEY WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT WE CONTEMPLATED BUT WHEN WE LOOK AGAIN IT DID THIS MAKE SENSE. TO TAKE THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THOSE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE IF WE COULD HAVE TO FIND AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE LOVED IT THEN THE ONES DOING THAT AND WITH A SHORT CONVERSATION I HAD WITH YOU EARLIER WITH REGARDS TO YOUR DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION BACKGROUND WE BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WE WOULD WE WOULD. HAVE TO TAKE SOME PRETTY SEVERE -- CONDITIONS BEFORE WE WOULD AGREE TO START SOMETHING WITH THE LACK OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAD IN CERTAIN AREAS. BUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING THAT WE HAD NO -- REASON TO BELIEVE WOULD BE AVAILABLE LETTER LATER -- HOW WE HOW I LOOK AT THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FACED ARE WE'VE ALREADY -- EXPANDED A HUNDRED MILLION TO A FEES WITH ONE OF OUR CONTRACTORS -- WE THINK THAT WE ARE LIKELY FACING MAYBE AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MORE. IN THE LAKE GOOD DELAY COST IN LARGE EX CONVICTS REASON FOR BEING. AFTER WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION WE'RE GETTING READY WE WERE HELD UP FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF LIQUID LITIGATION -- THAT'S WHY IT IS IT WAS MENTIONED WE HELD BACK ON IT WHICH IS IT WAS A IT WAS A NOTICE TO BEGAN TO THE C. P. ONE CONTRACTOR BUT WITH MAJOR LIMITATIONS SO WE COULD HIGH. TRY. TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE WHAT THE EXPOSURE WAS GONNA BE -- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THAT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN WITH THAT MONEY IT IS BEEN BUILDING ASSETS. OF THAT THREE AND A HALF MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN ROUND NUMBERS HAS BEEN LOST TO THE DELAY. I STILL THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE BENEFICIARY OF ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. OF ASSETS THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE AND ABSENT THAT -- WE WOULD PROBABLY BE SITTING HERE IF WE WERE EVEN SITTING HERE TODAY AT ALL. BEING QUESTION IS WHY HAVEN'T WE A COP RE NEVER ABLE TO BUILD ANYTHING. KING ALL THOSE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT WE HAD A LOT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION WERE IN THE C. P.'S. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ON THE AREAS THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT. AND WE WERE ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING ELSE WE WERE IN A MASSIVE RECESSION. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND MOVING FORWARD. WE WERE THE BENEFICIARY OF LOWER CONSTRUCTION COST WHEN WE WENT AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD ON CP. ONE THAT CP ONE CONTRACT CAME AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN ARE AND SHE ENGINEERS ESTIMATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION -- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE THE BRIDGE THAT -- IT WAS INITIALLY -- DIDN'T MAKE IT -- UNION PACIFIC STANDARDS SO THE OUGHT TO REPORT -- THAT THE STORY WAS TOLD THAT THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR SHOULD BEAR THE COST OF THE REDESIGN. AND THE BEAT BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORITIES. LATER APPROVAL -- TO APPROVED A CHANGE ORDER AGAINST THE ADVICE -- CHANGER OR WE JUST ALWAYS TO FIND -- THE EXPERTS TO TELL THE AUTHORITY OF WHAT NOT TO DO AND JUST MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPUNITY -- I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT -- THE THE EXACT -- CONDITION WITH REGARDS TO THAT REQUEST. ARE THAT THAT BIT OF ADVICE WE'VE GOT BUT I CAN I CAN SUGGESTION ENERGY IN GENERAL SENSE. WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE -- A LOT OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS. WE FIRED FOR AS FOR AS THEIR IT WE WE ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND WE CONSIDER IT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE KNOW THAT MAY BE GOING ON AND ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE. IN THIS -- ONE I SUSPECTED. THE ADVICE MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN HERE AND BY THE TIME THAT WE HAD INTERVIEWED AND WE HAD ALL THE FACTS FROM. OTHER SOURCES ABOUT THE SAME THING WE MAY NOT TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE CONSULTANT EVERY INSTANCE. AND WHAT I THINK HAPPENS HERE AND WHAT'S HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THIS WHICH IS REALLY -- TROUBLING AND EMBARRASSING IS THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY -- RECORDED KEY AND DOCUMENTATION WHY WE'VE DONE THINGS AND I CAN SIT HERE AND JUST TELL YOU IT'S ON INEXCUSABLE. AND I AM FRANKLY OF EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE HAVE EVER INTENDED -- IN OUR FINANCE AND AUDIT -- MEETINGS WHICH OCCUR MONTHLY AND I SUSPECT I I AM SURE I RECOGNIZE SOME OF YOUR STAFF MEMBERS HERE WHO HAVE. MADE A HABIT OF COMING TO THOSE BUT I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPORT BACK. THOSE ARE PRETTY -- THOSE ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT UP STERN MEETINGS. AND LOOKING. FOR LOOKING FOR THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH. SO DO YOU THINK THE AUTHORITY STAFF IS KEPT YOU WELL INFORMED AS DIRECTOR. THAT'S TRUE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK THAT -- I THINK WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM. I THINK AT THE WE HAVE WE HAVE AYE THIS YEAR IS THAT I SHOULD AND I SUSPECT ALL OF YOU WOULD IT. WOULD CONCUR -- WE WERE MORE THAN FORTUNATE TO HAVE BRIAN KELLY JOINED. AS A CEO OF THIS ORGANIZATION. JOE HEDGES JUST COME -- WITH A VERY IN DEPTH CONSTRUCTION BACKGROUND AND A HUGE PROBLEM ON A PROJECT THAT HE WAS. RESPONSIBLE FOR UP IN SEATTLE A TUNNEL PROJECT. GOING DOWN BILL THAT THAT LEVEL -- I BELIEVE THAT OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT -- I'M PROUD OF EVERYONE OF THEM. TO BREAK DOWN THAT WE HAVE I THINK IS NOT IN PEOPLE NOT TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S AND AS DEMONSTRATED BY THIS AUDIT. IT'S MORE IN DAMAGE IT'S IT'S YEAH IN. THE DOCUMENTATION NOT BEING THERE TO THE PROBLEMS ARE. WHICH IS WHY THIS WHOLE THING WITH REGARDS TO CONTRACT MANAGE -- CAN'T CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CAME AS A RESULT OF THE FINANCE AND AUDIT MEETING OUR COMMITTEE. ARE REQUIRING AN INTERNAL AUDIT ON ONE OF OUR CONTRACTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE DIDN'T LIKE THE RESULTS. SO WE THEN HAD THE INTERNAL AUDIT OFFICE. THAT AUDIT ALL OF THEM AND WE LIKE IT EVEN LESS. AND THE DIRECTION WE THEN YEAH IT GAVE US WE WANT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO BE DRAFTED AND APPROVED. WHICH OCCURRED LE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AS I RECALL. AND BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALL OF OUR CONTRACT MANAGERS -- ALL STATE EMPLOYEES RECEIVED A TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION INTERNALLY. AT FOR THE JOBS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. WE FELT COMFORTABLE ABOUT THAT AND THE STAFF KEPT AS WELL ADVISED OF THAT. AND I THINK THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT PRETTY MUCH. ALL UP AND DOWN BASED UPON THE INFORMATION WHAT I DO THINK IS WE'VE GOT TO IMPROVE. DRAMATICALLY THE INFORMATION THAT -- STAFF MEMBERS KNOW AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO DO THAT IS TO ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT. WHAT WE'RE DOING SO APPRECIATE HAD THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THE BASICALLY THE QUESTION ARE YOU WILL INFORM MY STAFF I AM ON A DAILY BASIS YES? SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN HOW FAR BACK WERE YOU INFORMED ABOUT THE ON GOING PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS WITH CONTRACT OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT. AS A DIRECTOR. I THINK THAT -- I CAN'T I CAN'T SUGGEST TO YOU THAT -- DEBT THAT HE HAS COME TO MEET DIRECTLY WITH SOMEBODY SUGGESTING THAT. I THINK THAT WE DISCUSS THINGS LIKE THAT AND FINANCE AND AUDIT AND WE GIVE DIRECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO FIX THIS -- THIS DISCONNECT. AND IS IT SOMETHING MONEY WITH YOUR AND BASICALLY IT'S THE INTERFACE WITH YOU. AS A DIRECTOR WAS STAFF. LIGHTING UP YEAH COME ON AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S. I I THINK THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY MOVED IN THAT I THINK WHICH I THOUGHT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IF. WE WERE DOING THIS SHOT A YEAR FROM NOW. AND AND THAT'S NOT A COP OUT BUT PRETTY EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SEEN IN CORPORATE IT IN THE AUDIT. AND ALL OF WHICH I AGREE. ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LOOK AT INTO SOME GREAT EXTENT INTERNALLY WITH OUR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT AND THROUGH FINANCE AND AUDIT -- AND THESE WERE ALL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED IF THERE'S ONE THING I'VE BEEN REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY IS THAT BECAUSE WE THAT WE WE HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW. ON THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR CONTRACT MANAGERS WHICH IS VERY CLEAR WITH WHAT THE AUDITOR AUDITOR FOUND OUT. AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH REGARDS TO THAT. THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE FIELD IS UNDER WAY NOW AND WILL BE COMPLETED WITH ALL. ROUGHLY FIFTY OF THEM. BY THE END OF FEBRUARY -- I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED AND I DID NOT KNOW THAT -- IN HAND FRANKLY. IT'S ON ME I DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION WHERE ARE WE ON THE OVERSIGHT [inaudible] SO. THE THIRTY CAN CURRENTLY AUDITOR'S SUGGESTION THAT THE CONTRACT MANAGE SUPPORT. OF IS UNDERSTAFFED AND TO BE STAFFED WITH STATE WORKERS INSTEAD OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER NOT ASKING THIS UNTIL. FOR THIS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN DC PEAK. OF WHEN EARLIER. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE IT BACK ALSO. IT SO IT WILL BE ON MY AGENDA AT OUR NEXT FINANCE NOTED MEETING. K. THE THE SOLUTION WITH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT -- AND SENATOR BILL IT MENTION THAT YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT -- OR HIT MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT -- PAYROLL LIMITATIONS OR COMPARE WHAT YOU PAY THE THE STAFF -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WAS IT ESTABLISHED BY THE AUTHORITY WHAT WOULD BE PAID? YOU KNOW I AND MISS FRASIER I'M I DON'T WANT AND I IF I AND ABOUT SENIOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT -- WE'VE BEEN TRYING WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HIRED PEOPLE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT POSITIONS TO RUN A SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT THAT. THROUGH THE PROCESS PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND -- CANDIDATES FOR THESE POSITIONS ME NOBODY WAS YOU KNOW WE COULD NOT WE WOULD GENERALLY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FINDING PEOPLE WHO WOULD. BE WILLING TO WORK AND RUN A PROJECT LIKE THIS FOR THE AMOUNT OF THERE BEING COMPENSATED. BECAUSE AS OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHEN YOU GET BELOW THAT LEVEL -- I DON'T THINK THE CHALLENGES AND I DON'T I I MUST TELL YOU I'M NOT QUITE SURE. WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS WHY IF YOU'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED AND? FOURTEEN PHYSICIANS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ALL TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FILLED AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO I DON'T BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE ENDEMIC IN THE STATE. WELL I JUST. YOU I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU BROUGHT BRIAN KELLY OVER HIS PAYS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO I'M WONDERING HOW WHY WOULD BE A PROBLEM TO PAY CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS WHO ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN THE FIELD DOING THE WORK BASICALLY I THINK -- THAT IT BY AND LARGE THEY ARE. UNLESS THEY ARE APPOINTEES OF BY THE GOVERNOR I THINK THEY AND THEIR COMPENSATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT SCALE OF STATE IN PLACE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A THAT IF IT IS AND HAS BEEN A HELPER. TO OF OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION PROJECT ADDRESSED AND IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH. LEGISLATION THAT TO WORK TOWARDS SOMEBODY THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE THE WATCHDOG FOR THE PEOPLE. LIKE HEY I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU COULD DO ONE OTHER THING AT THE SAME TIME. WOULD BE DEFINED USE -- TO HEALTH CLASS -- BREAK THROUGH THE CAP THAT WE'VE GOT THAT WE CAN PAY FOR ADMINISTRATION WELL IN AGAIN I'VE BEGGED TO BE A PARTNER FOR THE AUTHORITY FOR YEARS. BUT I ONLY GET TRICKLES OF INFORMATION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU AND I'VE EVER MET ME AND I'VE BEEN THE CHAIR FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BETTER PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE NOT CREATE THIS WALL OF SECRECY. OF THE GOES ON BECAUSE I ONLY GET INFORMATION. INJUST DRIBBLES AND I THINK THAT HAS TO STOP ALSO I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT WE DID IN IN THE IN THE CALTRANS -- COME HOME ACTUALLY HAS SOME OF YOU ANSWER TO IS THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND THERE'S NO PUNITIVE. OF ACTIONS AGO ONE NOBODY GETS FIRED AS MISTER MURATSUCHI THE CHAIRED GERMAN J. LIKE HIS. IS A AT DENOTED TODAY -- YOU YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE SORT IS GONE ON WITH. WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO DO WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT FROM THIS BODY SO AND AND WE WE APPRECIATE THE OVERSIGHT YEAR YOUR IDEA FUNDERS. YEAH I MEAN IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS IS THE I. G. THING WORK -- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF HAPPY PEOPLE AT THE AUTHORITY. MISTER CHAIRMAN TO GIVE MY TIME TO THE NEXT MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS PATTERSON. THANK YOU -- THREE THREE QUICK. AREAS -- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ME THE FUTURE POTENTIAL CHANGE ORDERS OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT. THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A A HUGE -- BUMP AND THAT'S FUTURE POTENTIAL IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE. WHY ISN'T GOING TO GET BIGGER AND WHY IS IT SO BIG NOW? I THINK THAT -- IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME ONE MOMENT I'M LOOKING FOR ONE OF THE DOCUMENT. I THINK CITY -- WITH REGARDS TO THE THE THE COST THAT THE AUDITOR IS USING -- MISTER PATTERSON WE CONCLUDE WEEK WE COME UP WITH THE SAME COST IT'S HOW WE ARE CLASSIFYING THE COST THAT. THAT AND AND I WOULD ONLY SHOULD SAY THIS THE AUDITOR HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT I'M JUST SAYING SO IT'S NOT THAT -- AND THAT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE AUDITOR WOULD AGREE OR DISAGREE BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE LOOK AT AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THAT. THIS START NUMBER THAT THE AUDITOR USED DID NOT INCLUDE SOME. THINGS IN ADDITION TO WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE THE CP CONTRACTS WE'VE GOT CP ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WAS USED WELL IN ADDITION TO THOSE FROM THE VERY OUTSET OF THE PROJECT. WE HAD OTHER COST WHICH INCLUDED PROVISIONAL SOUNDS AND CONTINGENCY. WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE WE CAUGHT AS AS YOU MAY KNOW BECAUSE OF YOU AND I BOTH BEING FROM FRESNO NINE WAS RELOCATED -- BETWEEN OUT BY GOLDEN STATE COMING COMING SOUTH THAT RELOCATION WE DIDN'T DO THE WORK BUT IT'S PART OF OUR PROJECT WE CONTRACTED WITH CALTRANS. THAT'S A NUMBER THAT IS IT AS WE WOULD LOOK AT IT WE WOULD IN HAVE INCORPORATED THAT THE NORM NORM NORTHERN EXTENSION THE THREE MILES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT -- IN IN THE IN MY S. STATEMENT -- WE INCORPORATE THAT -- AND WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T HEARD AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE A CHANGE ORDER THERE. BUT WHAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AT THE START POINT. WHAT WE HAVE IS? THE AS WE SEE IT THE FUTURE WORK -- THAT THE I THINK THE AUDITOR IS TALKING ABOUT WE'RE SEEING THAT IS IT AS ABOUT NOT A ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS REACHING THAT IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE THESE OTHER COSTS HAVE TO BE CAPTURED FROM THE BACK BEFORE THAT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T. OVER RUNS THEY WERE COSTS THAT AREN'T CAPTURED AT THE OUTSET AND WE DID HAVE THOSE CAPTURED IN OURS. OKAY BUT AGAIN I HER TESTIMONY THAT YOU CAN COOPER. WITH THE AUDIT BUT I GUESS TIGHTLY CHIRLA CONCURRENT WITH THE ON I CONCUR WITH THE TOTAL COST IS A MATTER OF HOW YOU CLASSIFY THE CAR OKAY LET'S LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEADLINE ISSUE AND THE THE CLAWBACK ISSUE -- I REALLY THINK THIS IS THE THIS IS THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP YOU YOU ARE FACING AN AUDIT. A BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THAT. FEDERAL ON IT -- BEGAN IN APRIL -- WE THINK THAT IT IS PROCEEDING AND WE MAY HAVE SOME RESULTS IN SEVERAL MONTHS THERE ARE. HEY EXPLICIT IN THE AUDIT. REAL CONCERNS ABOUT NUMBER -- ONE THE EARLY USE OF THE FEDERAL MONEY. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SIR IT SOUNDED LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE WAS PREPARED BY A LAWYER ANTICIPATING THE FEDS GOING OVER YOUR SHOULDER. THANK YOU BUT IT WAS. WELL THEN YOU CREATED MAYBE HAVE A LAWYER IS NOT. WHAT I HEARD WHAT I HEARD AND THAT? WAS A DEFENSE. OF WHAT OUR AUDITOR HAS CONCLUDED IS NOT DEFENSIBLE. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SOME ISSUES WITH THIS AND THAT BUT THAT'S JUST PART OF IT. BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE. WITH THE WITH THE CLUB ACT ISN'T MISSING THIS DEADLINE -- AND SO THE THE THE THE AND WHAT THE AUDITOR AT THE END OF THIS RECOMMENDED WITHIN. DAUGHTER USED THE TERM CONTINGENCY PLAN. I'M USING THE TERM [inaudible] PLAN B.. MR RICHEST PLAN A IS FAILING. YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE THREE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. AND WE'RE LEFT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WITH THE RAIL ROAD THAT GOES FROM OUTSIDE MADERA OUTSIDE BAKERSFIELD. HI THE AND IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T. BRING IT IN ON TIME [inaudible] THAT CLAWBACK. COULD BE THE TWO THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU STATE WE SO FORTUITOUS LEAST. GOT PAID TO US AND SO I'M ASKING YOU ABOUT. YOUR CONCERN OVER FEDERAL ON HAVE YOU BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FEDS. OR OTHERS IN YOUR AUTHORITY LEADERSHIP -- AND IF I ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT CONFIDENCE WITH THE AUDITOR'S I'M ASKING YOU CONFIDENCE. ARE WE GOING TO END UP HAVING TO GIVE BACK THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FEDS BECAUSE THAT'S THE POTENTIAL HERE. WELL YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S DECEMBER BUT IT'S SHE THERE'S SOME SOME SIMILARITIES WE HAD. WE HAD THE SAME ISSUE OR A A KIND SIMILAR ISSUE AND SPENDING THE MONEY HAD WE NOT SPENT IT BY SEPTEMBER SEVENTEEN WHATEVER WE HAD SPENT. WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MADE IT WOULD NO LONGER BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO US. WE THOUGHT BUT SERRANO I GUESS I'M THAT. OR USE IT AND YOU KNEW GOING IN THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT AND YOU MADE A CALCULATED DECISION. TO DO WHAT YOU DID IT BACK WITHOUT REPORTING IT TO US WITH WE WE HAD TO FIND THIS OUT MISTER KELLY HAD TO COME IN AND SAY WE MADE THIS TERRIBLE MISTAKE WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN. SIR IT'S NOT ABOUT YESTERDAY THIS IS ABOUT TOMORROW AND THIS AUDIT. IS COMING AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT I'M ASKING WHAT IS YOUR PLAN B. AND IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK -- I THINK GIVEN WHERE WE ARE. IT HOW ARE YOU WHAT CONFIDENCE DO YOU HAVE IN MEETING. THE TIMELINE AND IN DEFENDING YOUR USE OF THE MONEY. I THINK THE ALL THOSE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS I WAS JUST I WAS JUST GIVING. A SIMILARITY. IN WHAT WE HAD TO DO TO MEET THE SEVENTEEN DEADLINE WITH REGARDS TO GOING FORWARD. FIRST OF ALL I I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING. WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION AND THIRTEEN BUT WE WHAT WE LOST OVER A YEAR. BECAUSE OF OF LITIGATION. WE ALSO HAVE HAD DELAYS BECAUSE OF RIGHT OF WAY. AND WE'RE TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE THINGS SO WHILE WE MAY HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN. THEORETICALLY HAVING EXECUTED CONTRACTS. THE CONSTRUCTION IS RAMPING HAS BEEN RAMPING UP. NOT SINCE THIRTEEN BUT REALLY IT IS SINCE WE WERE ABLE TO START BUILDING SO AS WE AS WE HAVE NOW WE'VE GOT 77% OF THE RIGHT AWAY. FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND SOME PARTIALS OUT OF THE EIGHT NEED FOR THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. WHAT WE'VE DONE AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER TO MISTER PATTERSON WITH I THINK YOU DID WITH SOME CONSTRUCTION HERE AND SOME CONSTRUCTION THEIR AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN? THAT THAT WAS BY DESIGN BECAUSE THOSE PARCELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING ON WERE CALLED PRIORITY PARCELS BECAUSE THOSE ARE IN THE AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST COMPLEX CONSTRUCTION. TAKES THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME DESTRUCT INSTRUCTION IT IS JUST ON THE GROUND. THAT IS -- EARTH WORK FOR IN A LOT OF WASTE AND PUTTING RAIL ON TOP OF THAT IS REGION IS NOT REALLY COMPLEX DISCUSS. CONSTRUCTION BUT IF WE HAD ALL OF THAT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE THESE LARGE STRUCTURES WE WOULD HAVE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE SITTING THERE SO WE MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION -- THAT WE NEEDED TO GET THE CRITICAL PARCELS DONE FIRST. WHEN WITH SO I IT HAPPENS I HAVE A BELIEF? AND I THINK A REALISTIC ONE THAT YOU WILL SEE AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN OCCURRING THAT OUR RATE OF CONSTRUCTION SPEND IS INCREASING. WHAT WE WILL DO BY NEXT MARCH IS WE WILL HAVE YOUR PLAN BE IT WE'RE WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW? AND WHAT PLANNED BE WILL MEET ONE OF THEM ONE ALTERNATIVE WITH TIME THE IS LIKELY GOING TO BE ISSUE WOULD GAS. GOING TO OUR FEDERAL -- PARTNER THE FEDERAL -- RAIL ADMINISTRATION AND TALK ABOUT AN EXTENSION. I DON'T THINK TODAY AS I'M SITTING HERE THAT I THINK IT EXTENSION IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY. BUT I WANT TO PLAN FOR OR THEY THOUGHT OR WHAT IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT AND WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT -- SO TUNNELING THROUGH THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH PACHECO PASS IS NOT COMPLICATED EXPENSIVE AND COULD BLOW THIS WHOLE THING UP I MEAN HONESTLY. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE BUILDING ON TWO ENDS IT THERE'S NO CONNECTIVITY THAT I CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY. PUT UP. MONEY INTO AT THAT AND HAVE IT. HAVE IT BE DONE AND SO I I STILL COME BACK WHEN I SAY PLAN B.. WHAT IS PLAN B. WHEN YOU CAN'T COMPLETE? THE SEGMENTS WHAT WHAT PLAN B. IS IS HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE SPENT THE MONEY AND COMPLETED AND WE SPENT A SPENT THE MONEY AND COMPLETED THE WORK FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S NOT DRILLING THROUGH ANY ANY THE CHECK A PASTOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S NOT UNDER THAT THAT'S NOT UNDER CONSTRUCTION. WITH THIS MONEY THAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILES WITH THE FUNDS OKAY DO YOU CONCUR THAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO COMPLETE. WITH THE ENTIRE PROJECT CAN YOU DON'T HAVE THE K. ONE WE NEVER HAD THE ENTIRE MONEY TO COMPLETE FROM DAY. ONE IT'S NEVER CHANGED. TALK ABOUT AND AND ASK ABOUT THIS -- SPEED TIME IN COMPETITIVE. FROM THAT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL LOOK AT THE VALUE PROPOSITION HERE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WAS WITHIN THE SPEED YOU BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AN HOUR. AND YOU CAN YOU MAKE THE CLAIM ON SPEED TIME AND COMPETITIVENESS IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FLYING AIRPLANES FROM LA. TO TO SAN FRANCISCO YOUR SPEED. IS GOING DOWN. YOUR TIME IS GOING UP. I THINK THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IS GETTING A ROAD IT HERE. ARE YOU SIMILARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPETITIVENESS BEING A WROTE IT AND THE COMPETITIVE VALUE. OFTEN OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION THAT ISN'T AS FAST AND TAKES MORE TIME -- THEN WHAT YOU PROPOSED NO I'M NOT. AND OUR SPEED. IS ALWAYS BEEN AT OR ABOVE TWO HUNDRED AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE ARE NOT AT OR ABOUT THE SPEED IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED OR SIGN. THAT FOR THE ENTIRE DISTANCE YOU'D BE GOING TO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES AN HOUR THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED AND WOULDN'T BE INTENDED. IN IN IN URBAN AREAS EVEN IN OUR CITY AND FRESNO THAT TRAIN IS NOT GONNA COME FLYING THROUGH. FRESNO IT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES AN HOUR IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSER TO SPEED IS ONE THING I ALSO ASKED ABOUT TIME IF A BLACK HEART. LOW DOWN BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOUR TIME AND ROUTE IS GOING TO GO UP EVERY EVERY DESIGN DECISION WE'VE MADE FOR THE EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT HIGH SPEED RAIL. IS WITH A ABSOLUTE FOCUS ON HOW MANY. HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS WE I THINK RIGHT NOW OR TWO HOURS. THIRTY SIX MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABOVE TO TO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES WHICH IS WHAT'S REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION ONE DAY. AND WE'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH BELOW WHERE WE ARE NOW EVERY DECISION WE'VE NAY. AND ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK INTO BLENDING IS CAN WE PLANNED AND SAVE THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS STATE MONEY. AND STILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROPOSITION ONE A AND WE ARE STILL TODAY ON TRACK TO DO THAT. SO YOU. ALTHOUGH SAYING YOU CONCUR WITH THE AUDIT YOU ARE AGAIN SAYING YOU DO NOT CONCUR WITH THE SERIOUS CONCERN RAISED BY OUR AUDITOR THAT THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES BEING A ROAD IT. BY VIRTUE OF THE DECISIONS -- TO SPLIT BASICALLY SLOW IT DOWN. WELL WE'RE NOT THE THEIR THE TRAIN IS NOT SLOWING DOWN IT'S STILL AT WHAT WE VOIGTS. OF WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE UNDER PROPOSITION ONE A WITH REGARDS TO THE COMPETITION -- I KNOW FOR MYSELF EXPECT IT I MEAN. WE FOUGHT WE ALL GO TO AIRPORTS AND WE GET THERE AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE WE NEED. TO WE NEED TO GET ON THE AIRPLANE. AND THEN WE GOT A WONDER WAY OUT OF AN AIRLINE TERMINAL TO WHEREVER WE'RE GOING -- YOU HAVE AND YOU HAVE NONE OF THAT GOING ON WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND YOU MAY DECIDE TO GO ON AN AIRPLANE AND TAKE IT WHAT IS IT ABOUT AN HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES TO GET TO LOS ANGELES FROM SAN FRANCISCO. ARE YOU COULD GO TO OURS AND FORTY MINUTES BUT ADD ON TO THE SAN FRANCISCO IF YOU'RE STARTING THEIR ADD ON ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF. WHERE YOU COULD HAVE WALKED TO THE A HIGH SPEED RAIL TERMINAL AND WALKED ON THE TRAIN AND GO ON? THE ELAPSED AND I I I I I LOOK I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK IT'S A LOT OF SPECULATION. AND THE TRUST LEVEL THAT MANY OF US HAVE HERE. THAT YESTERDAY'S MISTAKES ARE GOING TO BE CORRECTED SO THAT TOMORROW IS NOT THE SAME OUTCOME. I CAN ONLY TELL YOU I CONTINUE TO HAVE REALLY SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU CAN EVEN DELIVER RECKONED A COMPLETED PROJECT AND THE BIG QUESTION FOR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA'S WHAT YOU GONNA LEAVE BEHIND. A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES FROM SOMEWHERE TO SOMEWHERE WHERE WEARING THAT TO ME IS THE BIG BIG PICTURE HERE THAT KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. I'VE I APPRECIATE THAT TOO SURE. YEAH WE ARE REQUIRED ALSO TO HAVE INDEPENDENT UTILITY. AND WHAT DAY AND THAT THAT SHOULD THAT NEVER REVEALED IN THE EVENT THAT THE PROJECT IS STALLED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME OR PERMANENTLY AGE ISSUE REGIS SUGGESTING. THAT WHAT WE'VE BUILT HE'S GOT TO HAVE INDEPENDENT UTILITY WHICH MEANS BE USABLE TO SOME. SOME FOR IT SOME OTHER OPERATOR IN THIS INSTANCE LIKELY AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- AMTRAK. SO THE EIGHT WHAT WE'RE BUILDING HOSTAGE SURE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. FOUR YEARS THAT YOUR PLAN BE HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN THAT -- YOU CAN'T CONNECT AND YOU BASICALLY NOW READ MEETING PUBLICLY THAT IT IS A MULTIPLE BILLION DOLLAR UPGRADE TO AMTRAK. UNLESS YOU CAN HAVE A PLAN AND A FINANCE AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO CONNECT THESE TWO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT IN LA SAN FRANCISCO AND IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TO WHAT. ULTIMATE PURPOSE THAT'S THE BIG PICTURE THAT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AS AS A RESIDENT OF THE AREA REPRESENTING IT UP HERE AND ALSO THE FORMER MAYOR YOU PLEASE DON'T LEAVE BEHIND. NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES OF MOUTH IT. I WOULD TELL YOU TODAY WE'RE NOT GOING [inaudible] TO WE'LL SEE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- US THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED THE AUDITOR BUT ALL A LEAVE WITH THIS. THE LAST SENTENCE OF OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THE AUDIT SAYS DESPITE ITS CHALLENGING FINANCIAL SITUATION WE DETERMINE THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS FAILED TO IMPLEMENT SOUND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AS A RESULT WE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THE THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF HAS SPENT ON ITS CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE. AND THEN NOW WE FEAR THAT THEIR WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE AUDITS IN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWELVE DONE BY THE DOCTOR. THAT THEIR INTERNAL AUDITS DONE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTY WHAT GRADE DO YOU GIVE THE AUTHORITY IN ITS MEASURE PRACTICES. WELL -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT GRADE DO IT PUT IT PUT TO IT AS YOU GIVE HAS ALREADY AUDITOR'S SUGGESTED INCOMPLETE -- I WHICH I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST THAT. AS A RESULT OF AT LEAST VERY POOR DOCUMENTATION -- IF I HAVE PUT A GREAT ON AND I WOULD SAY IT'S CORRECTABLE AND I WOULD SAY IT'S BEING CORRECTED RIGHT NOW SO YOU DON'T GET A PASSING GRADE RIGHT NOW. I I I I THINK YOU'RE STILL IN CLASS. OKAY WELL I'M GRADING RIGHT NOW AND GIVE ME A PASSING GRADE -- HOW LAW? IN TERMS OF BEING THIS BEING A STRUCTURAL. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMATIC FAILURE IN THE AUTHORITY DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. I WOULD SAY IT'S BEEN PRETTY CHALLENGING THAT IN THE PAST AND IT AS AS AS YOU MISTER PATTERSON SAID WITHOUT WITHOUT. FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON THE PAST I AM VERY. CONFIDENT IN OUR CURRENT SENIOR LEADERSHIP FOR THIS PROGRAM -- AND I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME. WITH THIS AUDIT AND I TELL YA I I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY WE'VE GOT IT BUT WHAT I'M ALSO HAPPY ABOUT. IS IT'S IDENTIFYING NUMBERS OF THINGS THAT WE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT AND WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING AND I WOULD. YOU KNOW I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND ALL IT COULD BE SCHEDULED AGAIN BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE AREAS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE PAST BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PARTICULAR. RIGHT AND SO RIGHT NOW I HAVE ARE AT THAT OUTLINED THE SAME MANAGEMENT STRUCTURAL FAILURES. AND ANY AND ME FORTUNATE UNFORTUNATELY YEAR ON THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. SO YOU ARE ON THE THE PERSON THAT HAS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION -- AND SO -- FROM THAT STANDPOINT YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIANS ARE RIGHTFULLY UPSET. AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND CAN IF IT'S A SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURAL PROBLEM. THEN THROWING MORE MONEY WHICH I MUST AND REMIND YOU IS NOT YOUR MONEY IN IS NOT OUR MONEY. THE HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN SO HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY AND DEFEND THROWING MORE MONEY INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING. WELL I DON'T THINK THE I THINK THAT I THINK THAT IN OUR MANAGEMENT OF OF SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS TO THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB FOR THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE TAXPAYERS ANOTHER STATE BROUGHT IN THE FEDERAL MONEY. I BELIEVE THAT WE WERE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF FIXING THAT I CAN'T CHANGE. THE PERCEPTION FROM THE PAST AND I I'M IS TROUBLED BY IT ISSUE ARE AND WELL I MEAN I'M I DON'T FEEL BADLY ABOUT BEING ON THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. I AM VERY HAPPY I AM ON THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. AND THAT'S WHY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN WHEN WE WHEN WE REQUIRE THOSE AUDITS -- WE DID THAT BECAUSE OF CONCERN AND WE WERE WORKING ON IT -- THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND PUT IN PLACE AT LEAST THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH ARE FAR GROUP FAR MORE THAN THE STATE'S. S. THE THE M. SEM -- WE HAVE EIGHTEEN SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT WE'VE IT WITH THAT WE'VE INCORPORATED AND IT. I THINK THAT WHAT THE ONLY CHALLENGE IS HERE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO OVERCOME PERCEPTIONS FROM THIS PAST. BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE IS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE AN BEFORE. IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND MAYBE -- MAYBE SHE HAD JUST CAN ANSWER THIS HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU SECURED. SIR CAN ANSWER QUESTION AGAIN HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE. HOW MUCH BY HOW MUCH MONEY THE AUTHORITY HAVE? THE BILL WHICH MONEY DO WE HAVE TO AVAIL ARCH TO TO BUILD. THIS PROJECT -- MISTER MISTER FONG WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE ALL THE MONEY NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. HOW MUCH MONEY IS THAT? THE THE ENTIRE PROJECT YEAH -- IT'S IT'S IT'S IT WOULD CRUSH CENTRAL VALLEY RIGHT NOW THE BUSINESS PLAN EIGHTEEN IS REPORTING THAT A TEN POINT. SIX IF YOU WANT TO THE BOOKENDS. I ENCOMPASSES THE BOOKENDS ADDED INTO THAT THAT MAKES IT ABOUT -- THIRTEEN POINT. FOUR OKAY THE ORDER HAS SECURED FUNDING TWELVE POINT SEVEN TO THE THE RIGHTS AND ALL THAT. ALL THAT IS WORTH WITH IN OUR CURRENT. CAP AND TRADE BUDGET AND WITHIN OUR CURRENT PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDING AND IN YOUR BUSINESS PLAN HAS THE FULL SYSTEM AT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION. PHASE. ONE PHASE. PHASE ONE THAT YOU ARE UP AND TWENTY TEN WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE SYSTEM. AT THE BEGINNING. YOU KNOW EN. GOING BACK TO TWENTY NINE AT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THIRTY FIVE THE I I THINK THE FIRST ONE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY USED A YEAR OF EXPENDITURE WAS SOMETHING LIKE. FORTY TWO SIX FORTY TWO SIX VIA CELL I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT THERE'S THE COST OVERRUNS AND CAR [inaudible] EMBEDDED BUT I'M LOOKING AT A SIGNIFICANT COST OVER A FROM FORTY TWO BILLION. TO SEVENTY SEVEN TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION. IF IT CAN I TAKE A MOMENT TO START DRESSING -- I HAVE -- I'LL JUST PUT IT I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF COMPASSION. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO -- PRECEDED US -- ON THE BOARD -- YOU'VE SEEN JUST BY WHAT IS HAPPENED ON THIS AUDIT AND THE TESTIMONY -- THE CHECK OUT A CHALLENGE OF THE PROJECT IS NOT HAVING ALL THE INFORMATION. GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WHAT INFORMATION THEY HAD EITHER. AND WHAT I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT WE'VE DONE YOU FONG SINCE THEN. IS THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE FIRST CAME ON THE THE BULK OF THE BOARD THAT IS IS CURRENTLY ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY -- WE WERE INVOLVED IN THAT THERE ARE FOR OUR FIRST. BUSINESS PLAN TO YOU IS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WE WENT THROUGH TWO OR THREE DRAFTS AND ONE FINAL -- WE HAD MORE INFORMATION THEN ANYBODY WHO WOULD WORK ON IT AND ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHEN PROPOSITION. ONE EIGHTY PLUS NINE AND TEN OUR NUMBER WAS. SIXTY EIGHT FOUR OUR NUMBER IN OUR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUSINESS PAN IS. SIXTY EIGHT FOUR EIGHT YEARS LATER -- EXCUSE ME SIX YEARS LATER WE'RE TOO WE'RE AT SEVEN WHO WERE AT SEVENTY SEVEN ONE IT'S ABOUT A I CAN I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LIVING WITH IT. WHAT WAS ESTIMATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND? NINE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BASIS FOR THE INFORMATION WISE I DO KNOW THE BASIS FOR THE INFORMATION FROM THE TIME WE CAN WE CAME IN. AND WE'VE BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH IT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR POINT BECAUSE WE ALL MAKING DECISIONS ON AND PERFECT INFORMATION AND WE WORK TOGETHER MORE INFORMATION YOU THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW THAT EXISTS IS THAT THE MORE INFORMATION WE GET. THE MORE WE WANT TO STOP THIS PROJECT AND THAT'S THE CONCERN. NOW CAN YOU OUTLINE TO ME. HOW THE PROJECT HAS CHANGED OR EVOLVED SINCE? TWO THOUSAND FOR FROM THE FIRST BUSINESS PLAN TO WHAT IT IS NOW. FROM. IT FROM -- COST PERSPECTIVE ON FROM THE FROM THE ACT AT MINUS ANYWAY AS TO THE AUDITOR AND AND EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS IS THAT WHEN THE THE VOTERS VOTED. FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL OR WHEN A IT WAS TO BE A STANDALONE PROJECT. IS THAT THE CASE CURRENTLY. IT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS THERE IS BLENDING AND UTILIZE UTILIZING AT OTHER EXISTING RIGHT AT BOTH RIGHTS OF WAY AND IMPROVEMENTS. AS PRIMARILY IN YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE SHED IN THE CORNER AT SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO. AND MORE RECENTLY AS WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN FROM GILROY. TO SAN JOSE AND THEN FROM OF BURBANK IT DOWN TO LOS ANGELES UNION STATION. AND IS AUDITOR POINTED OUT I THINK WAS TEN SOMETHING. THAT BILLION OR TWELVE SOMETHING BILLION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE REDUCE COSTS WERE. WHAT WE FOCUSED ON MISTER MYSTERY AT FONG? IS HOW DO WE CONTROL COSTS. AND HOW DO WE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROL COSTS. AND COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION ONE A SO BY I BUT TO MY ORIGINAL POINT RIGHT WHICH IS THAT IT'S NO LONGER WHAT THAT WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED. WITH THREE WITH RESPECT TO THE WAS NO LONGER STAND ALONE PROJECT WITH RESPECT RESPECT RESPECT -- TO THE STANDALONE PROJECT TAX CORRECT. WHEN MISTER KELLY TESTIFIED BEFORE US AND WE PROBABLY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATED THAT THE PROJECT -- PASSES PROBABLY FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BY. A MADE IF YOU IF YOU FACTOR IN IN MAY AND IF YOU READ THE BUSINESS THE PROJECT A PASS AS AN UNFUNDED ASSET. THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO WHERE THERE IS NO FOR FUNDING FOR RIGHT NOW THAT'S GRAND RIGHT SO SO AS MISTER PASS AND PATTERSON ALLIED WE HAVE. A CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT THAT RIGHT NOW IS. WE GOT. TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE BAY AREA SEGMENT. RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T CONNECT. RIGHT SO IS THAT THAT'S A THAT IS A TRUE STATEMENT. IT'S A TRUE STATEMENT THAT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING FOR ANYTHING THAT BEYOND WHAT YOU MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO. RIGHT I'VE ADDED BY THE FUNDING FOR IT AND FIND IT A WE COULD YEAH THAT'S RIGHT NUMBER SO NOT STUDENTS IN TERMS OF HOW TO DEFINE THAT BUT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO MONEY FOR THAT SECTION THAT'S GREAT SO WE DO HAVE SO RIGHT NOW THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING. AT A PROJECT THAT IS. THAT DOESN'T CONNECT. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE THAT THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible] RIGHT. AND AND SO DO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT. I THINK FROM -- FROM THE EIGHT YEARS OF BOARD MEETINGS THAT -- I'VE ATTENDED I THINK THAT AT LEAST THE PUBLIC BECOMES AND ADDRESSES THIS BOARD CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU THINK THE PUBLIC WOULD ACCEPT THAT. THAT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE PUBLIC I MEAN I THINK THE DECISIONS THAT WE MADE OUR CLEAR WITH IS IT WITH REGARDS TO BLENDING -- WERE NOT NECESSARILY CONTEMPLATED IN PROPOSITION ONE NAY BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THE RESULT OF IT IS IS IT DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COSTS THAT WE WERE SEEING. WHEN WE CAME IN AND JOINED THE BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND AND? TWELVE I'LL JUST IN MY AND MY LAST STATEMENT IS IT IS IT IS AYE AYE AYE REPRESENT. OF COURSE KERN COUNTY THEM AND SO WE ARE AFFECTED AS WELL FROM THIS PROJECT AND THE FRUSTRATIONS I HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS -- AB ARE PRETTY INTENSE AND SO. WHEN THE REPORT CONCLUDES? AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES FLOOD DECISION MAKING REGARDING THE START OF HIGH SPEED WITH OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION IN THE CENTER VALLEY. ITS ONGOING POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HIGH VALUE CONTRACTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COST OVER RUNS FROM COMPLETING THE SYSTEM WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH THIS AUDIT. THAT IS A TRUE STATEMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE I DON'T I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY NOW BUT THE PERCEPTION IS NOW BECOMING A REALITY AND I THINK WELL AND AND AND AND NO MATTER HOW YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU'VE BUILT IN THESE OVER RENTS ARE NOT. I'M LOOKING AT EIGHT FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE AT THE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TEN AND I'M LOOKING OUT A PROJECT SEVEN SEVEN BILLION TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A PRETTY WIDE RANGE. RIGHT IT'S TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND OF COURSE YOU NOW YOU TELL ME THAT A DOCTOR CAN ACT AS UNFUNDED AND THEN NOW WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO GO OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WILL. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLETELY FUNDED FROM THE OUTSET TO FORTY TWO BILLION OR THIRTY FIVE BILLION OR WHATEVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED YOUR POINT TO THAT POINT I DON'T THINK THE CAP THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC KNEW THAT WAS EVEN THE CASE EITHER. DID YOU DID WHEN YOU WENT TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND SAID WE WANT YOU TO BOND FOR A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FOR SOMETHING THAT WON'T COVER THE COSTS OF THE WHOLE PROJECT. DID ANYONE EVER SAY THAT. IT WAS BEFORE MY TIME I REALLY CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION CELL I I JUST LIKE THIS IS I MEAN I I KNOW. IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME TESTIFYING AND I I HATE TO BE A LITTLE HARD ON YOU BUT I MEAN THESE ARE REAL CONCERNS. AND AND AS THE AS US WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO BE STEWARDS AT CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLAR. WE HAVE TO ASK THESE HARD QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE LOAN AS THE POWER FOR TWO YEARS AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION WE HAVE TO MAKE SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THINKING. TWICE YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER RICHARDS MISTER HEDGES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I CAN TELL YOU IS A LAWYER I GET CAUGHT MOST. TO I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR UNDERSTANDING AND SO I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT -- YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR BRIAN KELLY. DID SOME EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN HIS OTHER POSITIONS AROUND HERE AND YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM WE ARE I HAVE A QUESTION I GUESS IS SORT OF A CONCERN YOU KNOW THE AUDIT REPORT. AND CERTAINLY THIS HEARINGS PROPERLY FOCUSED ON HAS BEEN THE DEFICIENCIES -- IN THOSE AREAS THAT -- IMPACTED PROJECT COMPLETION COST AND OF COURSE THE DELAYS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT [inaudible] AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME OF US THE COST INCREASES OF BEEN BREATHTAKING. BUT I WANT TO STEP BACK AND AND AND ASK A QUESTION BUT FIRST. SET THE STAGE FOR MY QUESTION. YOU KNOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MODERN DAY HIGH SPEED RAIL PROBABLY DATES BACK TO THE JAPAN MAYBE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR BEFORE THE OLYMPICS. AND THEN FOLLOWED BY ITALY AND FRANCE THAT'S ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO. AND IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AT LEAST SOME FORM OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WAS OPERATIONAL IN GERMANY. AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTY THREE MAYBE FROM THIRTY THREE TO THIRTY NINE AND THAT'S CERTAINLY OVER. EIGHTY YEARS AGO SO. THIS IS NOT A A NEW TECHNOLOGY AT LEAST IN ITS BASIC FORM. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROJECTIONS FOR COMPLETION OF PHASE ONE OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THREE MAYBE LATER MAYBE MUCH LATER MAYBE. TWENTY FIFTY GIVEN ALL THAT AND GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY SPEED WITH WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF OF PEOPLE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TON WAS VEHICLES -- HYPERLOOP -- TRANSPORT. I GUESS THIS IS MY QUESTION. HAS ANYONE INSIDE YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OUTSIDE YOUR ORGANIZATION -- TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE TAKEN A STEP BACK CLIMBED UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET. AND REASSESS THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF A OF THE CONCEPT OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THREE OR TWO THOUSAND FIFTY OR BEYOND BECAUSE SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THE END OF THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE GOT A FACE. TO OR ARE WE SIMPLY BENT ON AUTO PILOT SENSE. NOT A CRITICISM BUT SIMPLY BEEN ON AUTO PILOT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX OR TWO THOUSAND OR EVEN. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WITH RESPECT. WELL IN THE AUTO PILOT NEVER GOT ENGAGED ON THIS FORTUNATELY BUT WE PAID WE PAY ATTENTION. TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE GOING ON AT LEAST -- BEING CONSIDERED TO HAVE POTENTIALLY DEVELOP AND THAT SORT OF THING WHAT WE ALSO NOTICES THAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING BUILT ALL AROUND THE WORLD. CONTINUES TO BE HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT'S A PROVEN AT TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVE AT SPEECH THAT ARE -- GREATER THAN ANY OTHER. FORM OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND WHILE WE READ ALSO ABOUT HYPERLOOP AND MAGLEV AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING -- WE DON'T WE DON'T GET IS SICK WE DON'T SIMPLY -- TAKE A POSITION THAT IT'S IT IT MAY NOT BE VIABLE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE DON'T SEE IN THE NEAR TERM -- OR DURING DURING THE LIFE OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT'S JUST BEING BUILT THAT IT IS NECESSARILY GOING TO BE SURE PASSED BY OTHER FORMS OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MEETS PERFECT ROUGHLY GEOGRAPHY GEOGRAPHY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE HIGH SPEED REAL STORIES YOU IN THE PORTS YOU AND I'M SURE YOU TALK ABOUT IT. BUT HAS THERE BEEN A TIGER TEAM PUT TOGETHER OR PROJECT TEAM. SOME OTHER GROUP TO ACTUALLY STUDY THE IMPACT OF EXTRA. A CHANGING STRUCTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY JUST IN THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TO COMPARE THAT TO THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS. TO BE STARTED TO PUT TOGETHER IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND TWO THOUSAND THAT'S NINETY SIX IS A LONG TIME IN TWO THOUSAND IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING NINETEEN YEARS AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF ANYBODY IS REALLY TAKING THIS THING DOWN TO THE TO THE ROOTS AND AND TAKEN A LOOK AT IT. OR ARE WE SIMPLY MOVING AHEAD BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT. WHATEVER IT IS TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN WE NEED TO KEEP MARCHING HONOR WE HAVE. TO CONSIDER WHAT THE OFFRAMP IS OR HOW WE PAY IT BACK. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION -- AND I AM NOT AWARE OF IT AT THE TIGER TEAM THAT HAVING BEEN FORMED -- WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO THIS IS TO WHATEVER THE FORMER TRANSPORTATION MAY BE -- WITH WHATEVER HOWEVER TECHNOLOGY CHANGES -- ONE THING THAT IS A ASSET THAT SURVIVES ALL OF THAT IS THE RIGHT OF WAY. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND IT HAS IN THE TAXPAYERS HAVE PAID -- FOR WHETHER THAT RIGHT OF WAY AT SOME POINT MAY SUPPORT MAG LEV OR HYPERLOOP OR SOME OTHER FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY IT'S AN ASSET THAT IS NOT A LOST ASSET FOR THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WELL THANK YOU I DO THINK YOU KNOW WHOEVER'S LISTENING I DO THINK IT'S TIME -- TO MAY BE. AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU PUT CONTINUE TO PROCEED FORWARD MARCHING ON MAYBE BUT THAT. PERHAPS IT'S A TIME FOR SOMEBODY. TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN. AND REALLY. THINK IN TERMS OF FUTURES YOU KNOW ORGANISER PRIVATE -- FORMING FUTURES GROUPS NOW AND IT'S NOT -- WITHOUT GOOD REASON AND MAYBE WE OUGHT TO DO THE SAME THING BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SHOWS LIKE REFERENCE CHECK YOU FOR THE ADVICE [inaudible] SARAH -- THE FIRST TO COMMENT THAT -- JUST REFLECTING ON SOME OF YOUR STATEMENTS THE I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE NATIONAL LEADERS. TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD. AND INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. LET'S WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE FOLKS WE NEED MORE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO COME TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. AND SMELL THE COFFEE PUT TOGETHER AN INFRASTRUCTURE BACK. IN -- WE ARE WE ARE ALL WORK AS A BIPARTISAN TEAM IN CALIFORNIA. TO OUR HOUSE OR LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION. TO HELP CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY BY CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH HASN'T BEEN DONE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES. THE LATE EIGHTIES HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT. SO I TAKE I THINK IT'S TIME -- FOR SOME -- STRONG EFFORTS AT THIS POINT I HOPE I CAN GET THE MOMENTUM. GOING ON THAT I THINK CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS DIRECTED US IN AND GAVE US SOME DIRECTION THAT THEY WANT SO MOMENTUM. IN THIS AREA SO I HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU -- MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN -- YOUR FROM FROZEN CORRECT YES SIR -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT -- BECAUSE PER THE AUDIT -- THAT KIND OF WASN'T COVERED FULLY. WAS THE ECONOMIC -- IMPACT [inaudible] AND I I REALLY WANT TO SEE A CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND FRESNO AND IS IN THE BAY AREA I THINK IT WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMIC. STRONG ECONOMIC IMPACT. BOTH WAYS SO I MEAN. YOU HAVE ONE OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE IN THE STATE TO ABOUT IT HAS ONE OF THE BEST ENGINEERING SCHOOLS COMPUTER SCIENCE -- UNKNOWN. BECAUSE PRESS OF ITS ISOLATION FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUT UNKNOWN. FRESNO STATE HAS A WONDERFUL -- HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THERE AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE IN SILICON VALLEY WANT TO CONNECT WITH. FRESNO BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY. PEOPLE ARE ALMOST LIVING IN FRESNO IN COMMUTING TO SILICON VALLEY AS WE SPEAK. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO C. OF SOME OF THE COMMUTERS MAYBE GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. OKAY IF WE HAD. SOME OF THE COMPANIES MAKE INVESTMENTS. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL IMPACT. FOR THE FRESNO METROPOLITAN AREA OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ON THAT HAVE YOU KNOW WE DID STUDY THAT FULLY IN THE AUDIT. BUT THAT WAS A DIRECTIVE OF THE AUDIT. TO SO COULD YOU IT CAN YOU OF FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE. AS A BUSINESSMAN AND FRESNO GIVE US SOME PERSPECTIVE. YEAH I'D LIKE TO DO THAT THANK YOU SENATOR DEAL OR I'M SORRY I KEEP DOING ITS -- SENATOR BILL -- JUST A COUPLE OF OF OF QUICK FAXES YOU. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY DON'T REALLY. REALIZE -- WHAT THE POPULATION IS THERE WE'VE GOT IN A IN THE EIGHT COUNTY AREA WE'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO BILLION ARE SKEWS ME MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT NOW? BY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY IS IT IT'LL INCREASED BY FIFTY BY 50% UP TO ABOUT SIX AND A HALF. IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS -- BOTH STATEWIDE AND FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEN I I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WHAT I THINK IT'S DOING FOR THE FRESNO COMMUNITY -- FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD -- ENDED DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT THE STATE WIDE IT'S REPRESENTED INVESTMENTS OF FOUR POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN EMPLOYMENT STATEWIDE. THERE'S BEEN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND JOB YEARS CREATED. AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT PACKED ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR BILLION. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALONE -- OF THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND JOB YEARS. FOURTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED OF THEM ARE RIGHT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN AND AROUND FRESNO. AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ALREADY HAS BEEN OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S GOING TO GROW DRAMATICALLY AS WE FINISH. THIS HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A COMMUNITY -- THAT -- I A ONLY HOPE THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE GONE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONCE HOPEFULLY AND GOT TO KNOW IT A LITTLE BIT I'VE BEEN THERE. FORTUNATELY. EVERY TIME SOUNDS A STATE POLICE PRESENCE AT THE BULLDOGS WENT HOME AND YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST I'M SORRY BUT YOU KNOW WE JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT -- SPECIALLY IN -- THE BULLDOG I MEAN IT'S JUST. WELL WE'VE GOT A GREAT SENSE OF YOU KNOW -- THE THE YOU KNOW FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HIGH SPEED RAIL REPRESENTS I I'M NOT FROM FRESNO I MOVE THERE -- AFTER AFTER COLLEGE I THINK THINKING I'D BE THERE FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND THEN MOVE BACK OVER THE COAST WHICH DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU END UP STAYING WHERE YOUR FRIENDS ARE. AND I MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS HERE. AND I'VE STRUGGLED OVER THE YEARS THINKING WAS IT REALLY WISE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE I IT EARLY ON MY REACTION TO FRESNO I'VE NEVER. SEEN A COMMUNITY THAT IT APPEARED TO HAVE SUCH A LOW SELF ESTEEM. AND IT REALLY WAS IT WAS REALLY ALARMING -- BUT WHAT I A RECOGNIZED OVER THE YEARS THIS LOW ESTEEM WAS THE RESULT OF A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY AND THERE'S A PERCEPTION IN THE VALLEY THAT WHEN THINGS HAPPEN IN THIS STATE. THEY NEVER FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF THE BAY AREA AND THEY NEVER FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO SITTING IN A POSITION LIKE THIS WHERE I REALLY REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I TRIED AND I TRY TO MONITOR HOW I REALLY FEEL ABOUT. MY JOB BUT WHEN I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS IT DOING FOR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IT'S UNBELIEVABLE -- WE HAVE GENERATED THOSE JOBS IN SOME PART WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A THE GRANT THAT THAT OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD WHEN I WAS THE CHAIR OFTHAT. RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNOR A HALF DOLLARS IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE I'M ON A LOT OF MONEY BUT WITH THAT MONEY DID IS IT WENT. IT WENT TO SUPPORTING COHORTS FOR TRAINING. AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THESE PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THOSE CORE HOOKED CO WORDS ARE GETTING JOBS. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL AND AS YOU MENTIONED EDUCATION. UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD FRESNO STATE UC MERCED -- NOW SAY THOSE THREE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS I'M NOT QUITE IS AWARE OF OF WHAT TO DEPRIVE ONES ARE BUT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE MEANT EMBRACED. HIGH SPEED RAIL AND ESTABLISH PROGRAMS. FOCUSED ON ENGINEERING IN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND A I IN THE AREAS OF CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY BENEFITS FROM THESE JOBS NOT ONLY PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK BUT THEM ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT IT'S BROAD AND TO THE COMMUNITY AS I MENTIONED -- THE ECONOMIC IMPACT TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS UNHEARD OF OFTEN WHAT I THOUGHT. AND I THINK THIS ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL -- A LOT YOU KNOW AND WE WERE FORTUNATE IN MY MIND TO GET THE OUR SONS AND WE HAD 17% UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT WHAT I SAID WHEN I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO GROUPS. IS THAT. THE NEAR TERM JOBS WHICH WERE ON THE CAKE. BECAUSE THE REAL OPPORTUNITY FROM BEING THE FIRST. AND THAT'S NOT JUST CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IT'S THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE FIRST TO BE DOING THIS. NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES AND IN FACT ALL OF NORTH AMERICA THERE IS NOT A HIGH SPEED RAIL. CONSTRUCTION PROJECT UNDER WAY IN ANY OF THAT AREA. THE REAL BENEFITS. THAT COME TO THIS STATE AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY FOR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT IS BEING GAINED BY ACTUALLY HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT. AND ITS CONSTRUCTION AND ITS OPERATION WHEN WE GET STARTED. THE S. HIGH SPEED RAIL FINDS IT SWAY FROM STATE TO STATE TO STATE AND AS YOU PROBABLY ARE WHERE. I MEAN KEPT THEIR WORKING ON IT TEXAS THERE WORKING ON IT AGAIN I BELIEVE IN OHIO AND WISCONSIN. IN FLORIDA -- WHEN LIKE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE SO WELL WHEN PEOPLE START LOOKING AT WHERE WHERE WE GONNA GET THE EXPERTISE? TO DEVELOPER BUILD HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT EXPERTISE IS GONNA COME FROM CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GONNA EXPORT THAT EXPERTISE TO THE OTHER STATES IN THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME UP AND LEARN THE WAY. AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE WITH SMALL COMPANIES -- NOW DEVELOPING AND BUILDING HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT THEY WILL BE THE ONES WHO CAN GENERATE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND BE THE LEADERS NOT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE LEADERS IN THE EXPANSION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT'S ONLY THE SCRATCHING THE SURFACE THE BENEFITS WERE GETTING TODAY. IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. I I THINK GOOD JOB JUST. YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD STORY AND I THINK. PERHAPS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY US A QUESTION AND THE AUDITOR'S THEY WANTED A SYSTEMATIC REPORTING ON THE ECONOMIC. BENEFITS OF ALL THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CERTAINLY SP ONE AND HOUSING BOND THOSE OF THE TWO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN YEAH AND THEN I THINK. WE ARE WE ARE OF KEEP TRACK OR ECONOMIC. BENEFITS. FROM ALL THESE PROJECTS IN A SYSTEMATIC -- WAY. AND SO IT IS SO I I WANNA I WANNA MOVE DOWN ON A MORE FORMAL BASIS -- FOR CALIFORNIA I THINK CALIFORNIA THE PEOPLE NEED TO SEE -- OF THE ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT STORY. BETTER THAN THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PAST THEY LOOK AT THESE THINGS IS LIKE. COST RATHER THAN AN INVESTMENT. HANNAH AND I THINK -- THAT'S PART OF IT. SO -- DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT -- LAKE VISION WISE AFTER HIGH SPEED REELS BUILD. JUST -- SO I CAN TELL MY PEOPLE IN SAN JOSE. HOW? SILICON VALLEY AND FRESNO. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE? SYNERGY BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT IT WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO IN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW IT AT A CHAIR AT THE TABLE THE ECONOMIC TABLE CALIFORNIA. AND THE BIG ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO CENTRAL VALLEY IS HAD AND STE SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY FRESNO IS JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET THERE. IF YOU'RE DEALING. IN SOME SORT OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WHO -- AIRLINE TRANSPORTATION IS NOT THE WAY IT USED TO BE AS YOU AS WE ALL KNOW -- TO HAVE READY ACCESS TO THEIR POWER CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE THE SILICON VALLEY FROM CALIFORNIA FROM FRESHNESS PERSPECTIVE WE'VE GOT. A GROWING AND VIBRANT TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY A. -- IN FRESNO OVER THESE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS -- WERE ONE PROBABLY ONE MAJOR A BREAKTHROUGH AWAY FROM BUSTING OUT OF BEING A MASSIVE NUMBER OF SMALL COMPANIES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE NEXT BEST THING IN TECHNOLOGY. AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. IS THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT SENATOR. IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THIS TO WHAT THAT SILICON VALLEY FOR INSTANCE OFFERS TO US IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WE CAN OFFER YOU THEM AND WE BECOME VIABLE PLAYERS IN THAT. WHEN WE'VE GOT READY ACCESS TO GET TO OTHER MARKET PLACES WHICH WE'VE REALLY NOT HAD EVER? WITHTHE EXCEPTION ISSUE IN THE YEARS I'VE LIVED THERE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE. AND AGRICULTURE IS OUR MAIN STAGE YOU RIGHT NOW BUT AGRICULTURE CANNOT SHOULDER THE BURDEN ALONE. AND WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING OTHER AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE ON A LARGE PART OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF OUR AREA THIS ROUND. THANK YOU AND APOLOGIES FOR GETTING HERE LATE TODAY THEY HAVEN'T FULLY DEVELOPED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND GETTING ON THE HIGHWAY NINETY NINE WAS A LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS THAN I HAD EXPECTED. I WANTED TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES IN A BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL FASHION FOR ASKING FOR THIS AUDIT IN REQUESTING THIS INFORMATION. IN MEDICINE WE OFTENTIMES ASKED FOR TEST WHEN WE WERE AT AN INFLECTION POINT AND I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE AN INFLECTION POINT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES? THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDIT ARE EXEMPLARY AND TO JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUDITOR AGAIN SHE IS CONSTANTLY BEEN TIMELY AND PROFESSIONAL AND DOES HER JOB WELL AND GIVES MANY OF US CONFIDENCE -- IN THE SHE PUTS FORWARD. I'M REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO YOU IF I COULD ABOUT THE SPECIFIC SUGGESTION THAT SENATOR PELL MADE REGARDING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE. AMENABLE TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD. AND WHETHER QUARTERLY REPORTS SEEMED AS IF IN AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME -- WITHOUT BEING OVERLY BURKE -- THANK YOU A ASSEMBLYMAN ARAMBULA I I CAN'T -- I'M NOT SPEAKING FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT I WOULD SAY THAT -- I NORMAL PRETTY WELL I FOR MYSELF I WOULD ABSOLUTELY EMBRACE THE IDEA -- I WANTED TO TALK AS WELL IF I COULD ABOUT THE SENATE BILL -- ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH I FOR MANAGED TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HERE FOR CARRYING IT AND WANTED TO SEE WHAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS -- IN RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITIONS HOW THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THIS PROCESS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT WAS ADDRESSED AT ALL IN THE AUDIT AS IT WAS PASSED AFTER THE ON IT WAS REQUESTED. BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SPEAK -- TO THE MERITS OF THIS BILL AND HOW YOU SEE IT AFFECTING. GOING. FOR I DON'T KNOW IF JOE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING TO IT BEYOND THIS BIT -- FOR THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GETTING IT DONE -- IT IT. IT TIME COMPLICATES -- A PART OF RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION AND SPEECH THE PROCESS. AND IT GIVES US THE SAME A RIGHTS ARE THIS DON'T SAY RIGHTS BUT THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT CALTRANS OPERATES UNDER AND WE WERE FOR YEARS ASK WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOT THE SAME. ABILITY THAT CALTRAIN ARE CALTRANS HAS TO GENERATE A RIGHT OF WAY -- IT WAS JUST IT WAS JUST NOT EASY SO WHAT YOU DID IS GREATLY APPRECIATED IT WILL HELP IN THE EFFICIENCY. AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR OF OUR ASSEMBLY OF RIGHT OF WAY. FROM ISLAND WITH IF I CAN -- WANTING TO ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS OF LOOKING AT THIS A YEAR FROM NOW AND MANY OF US ON THIS DíAS ARE GONNA WANT TO SEE AND TO ENSURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR ARE COMPLETED AND JUST WOULD LOOK FORWARD. TO THAT DISCUSSION ON THAT DAY. BUT WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN MY BACKYARD. AND THE BENEFITS THAT ARE OCCURRING EACH AND EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL -- IS TACTILE. EACH CHANGING THE WAY WE FEEL IN THE VALLEY WHEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT BEING FIFTY TWO MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SILICON VALLEY. AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST WHETHER THOSE START UPS ARE GONNA COME TO US BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHETHER OR NOT WE DEAL WITH SOME OF OUR COMPLEX. PROBLEMS LIKE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BY ACTUALLY INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS WHAT MOST. INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND STATES ARE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD -- TO CONTINUING THE SUCCESS THAT HAS STARTED -- AND INSURING THAT -- WE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE -- WITH OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S MY TURN. THIS RICHARD SAID THANKS. FOR COMING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AND I I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I AGREE WITH THE CENTRE BELL. AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER AROUND A LOT IN TERMS OF THE TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR THIS. PROPOSAL FOR A VALLEY TO VALLEY -- CONNECTION THAT -- HAS BEEN DISCUSSED -- MAG WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. TALKING ABOUT TO THAT NOT ONLY ARE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS BUT ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE SILICON VALLEY WORK FORCE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AS A POTENTIAL COMMUTING -- WORKFORCE I I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE POTENTIAL. FOR A STATE WIDE YOU COPYING IMPACT IS IS A VERY CLEAR. TO TO ALL OF US -- HAVING SAID THAT I YOU KNOW I AM VERY CONCERNED -- WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDITOR AND YOU KNOW HIGH -- NOT SURE THAT -- NOTHING PERSONAL BUT YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IS A GONE FAR. IN TERMS OF REGAINING MY TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE THIS PROJECT -- THAT THAT'S COMING FOR ME AS A AS A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN ENTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND AND IMPORTANCE OF OF OF CREATING JOBS -- ESPECIALLY AND THE ECONOMICALLY DISC -- DEPRESSED AREAS OF WHAT IF OUR STATE -- BIKE BIGGEST CONCERN AS I I THINK -- HAS BEEN THE CENTRAL THEME OF THIS WHOLE HEARING HAS BEEN. WHETHER. TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. AND WHETHER WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT HAS PRETTY BE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT -- AND I I HEARD YOU SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW I THE BASICALLY THAT YOU'RE. ACCEPTING AS REPRESENTATIVE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THAT THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN. IN YOUR WORDS -- THE EMBARRASSED INEXCUSABLE TOO SLOW WITH OVERSIGHT. AND THAT IT'S ON ME YOU WERE AND IN TERMS OF NOT ASKING WHERE ARE WE WITH OVERSIGHT. AND AND THAT COMES ONLY AFTER I CORD TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AFTER TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ON THAT BUT THAT'S A AND SO. MY CONCERN IS IS GOING FORWARD IN THE UNITED I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO HERE MORE ABOUT TO THE PROPOSAL THEM INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT YOU KNOW WE A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION IN TODAY'S HEARING IS BEEN FOCUSED ON ON HIRING STATE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN. BE -- OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS BUT I I THINK WE'VE ALSO. THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH TESTIMONY TODAY OF THE CHALLENGES OF ATTRACTING -- THE TALENT NECESSARY ORDER. TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE THE SCOPE OF OF OF OF THIS TYPE OF PROJECT WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS YOU'RE GONNA PUT BUT THE B. C. P. OUT FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. WE'RE GONNA ADVERTISE THE POSITION IN THOSE POSITIONS ARE COULD BE LEFT UNFILLED AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. THE THE THE THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE EXCUSE TO SAY WELL WE CAN'T FILL THESE POSITIONS WHO HAVE TO CONSULT WITH TO CONTINUE WITH THE CONSULTANTS. IN THE MEANTIME THE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE IS LOOMING -- YOU KNOW BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT. HOW PART OF PLAN B. MAYBE DO IT REQUESTED EXTENSION? BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT GUARANTEED AND FROM OUR AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE -- TO TO TRY TO AVOID THAT SCENARIO. I AND ONE ASK GOOD -- MISTER HEDGES. I MEAN I MY MY MY FOLKS LIVE IN -- IN IN SEATTLE AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT [inaudible] TO THAT -- PROJECT THEY WORKED ON UP THERE WAS A WITH WAS A BIG DEAL -- IMMEDIATE IT'S IT'S ART AREN'T THERE ARE. MODELS OR OR OR OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR PUBLIC PROJECTS TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY -- SCOPE -- CONSULTANTS WITH MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND WITH THE ACTUAL COMMITMENT AND AND AN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF OF ACCOUNTABILITY. TO TO ENSURE ONE THAT WE HAVE COMPETENT EXPERIENCED PEOPLE TO MANAGE THE SCOPE OF THESE PROJECTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW. ENSURING THAT WE COULD WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND AND AND YOU KNOW I I I JUST DON'T NECESSARILY SEE. HIRING STATE EMPLOYEES TO DO THE JOB AS BEING. THE THE BE ALL AND END ALL HERE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. THAT MODEL IS VERY VIABLE. IT'S BEING. BASICALLY APPLIED AS WE SPEAK WE SHIFTED TO THE NEW ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE JUST DID. WE MOVED THE STATE WE DEFINE IT IN A RACY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE ROLES OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS AUTHORIZATION OVERSIGHT. BUT TO BE AUGMENTED WITH THOSE OF CONSULTANTS AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT DID YOU PM P. DOES. NOW THE THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS IS EXACTLY THAT IS TO APPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED OF SEATTLE. WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED YOU RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SEEING WITH THIS. I DON'T WANNA PLAN B. IS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY PLAN. AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE HERE RIGHT LIST WHICH GIVE. WHICH IS ORGANIZATION WAS GET REORGANIZED WE'VE DONE THAT LET'S GET A WINE TO THE CONTRACTORS WE'VE DONE THAT. OKAY AND LET'S GET TO OUR PROCESSES IN OUR PROCEDURE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE -- SP YOU ONE ONE SEVEN TWO SOFT LITERALLY FOR MONTHS OFF OFF THE ACQUISITION OF REAL STATE PROPERTY. THE BIG THING WHAT YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IS ALIGNMENT WE HAVE IN THIS WHAT I CALL THE GET TO WORK SCHEDULES. IS VERY METHODICAL OF BALLING CORD THAT GOES BAG BACK AND FORTH WITH A GARCIA. TO THE SEQUENTIAL DEFINABLE FEATURES A WORK THAT OF CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE IT'S WORKING. WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS GAINS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IN RIGHT AWAY. YOU'RE SEEING NOW THAT THE LEFT WITH REGARDS TO TO A ARE EIGHT EXCLUDABLE ROW AS DOUBLED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. WE GIVE WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW IS THE TRADITIONAL S. CURVE OF CONSTRUCTION. RIGHT YOU WILL SEE IT COMING UP WE WE HAVE THOSE CONTROLS. IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THE BILL THE TO SHARE IF PROMISED YOU WITH THAT WITH REGARDS. TO THE INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR STAFF ALREADY ONE START SHARING THIS INFORMATION AND PROVEN TO YOU I SAID IS MAYBE ON ABOUT THE SIX STATES. IN <u>NG EAST OF MISSOURI</u> PERSON SHOWING YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO START DOING ALL THE LEADING INDICATORS ARE THERE ARE STARTING TO TAKE HOLD. AND AND WORK ITS WAY OUT CAR. ALRIGHT SO WHAT I HEAR IS THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT -- TO ABANDONED THE THE POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE TO USE -- CONSULTANTS OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS BUT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN PROPERLY ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. ABSOLUTELY SURE THERE'S A ROLE FOR STATE PAROLE FOR CONSULTANTS AND SPECIAL THE REALIZATION IS -- THAT EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY. THAT THAT THE CONSTRUCTION WILL AND AND WILL THEN TRANSITION INTO OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. IN IN TERMS OF FOCUSING ON THIS VALLEY TO VALLEY -- A MAJOR RIVER OVER THE CALL THAT THAT CENTER BILL ONLINE ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARRIVAL ARE TALKING ABOUT. HAS -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- BOARD HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT [inaudible] FOCUSING ON THAT -- PROJECT OF TO COMPLETE THAT FIRST BEFORE -- CONTINUING WITH THE REST OF THE THE PROPOSED -- PROJECT -- BEFORE CONTINUING NORTH FLETCHER I'M SURE IT'D BE IT THE THE REST OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSITION ONE A A PROPOSAL TO CONNECT TO SAM CISCO. TO UTILIZE ANGELES -- THAT IS SET. I'M SURE. IN THE SAME CLASS SERVICE LET THE BIRD. IN THE EVENT THAT QUESTION I I COULD LIKE RESTATING WHAT I MEAN -- BASICALLY IT HASN'T BEEN ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRYING TO FOCUS ON COMPLETING THE VALID VALLEY PROJECT FIRST YEAH. YES AND THEN REVISITING THE VIABILITY OF OF CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT. I THINK THAT -- IT THAT. EXACTLY I MEAN WHAT WE ARE DOING IS IS FOCUSING ON COMPLETING VALLEY TO VALLEY -- IT IS ALWAYS BEEN THE WORD. IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE IT'S ONE OF THE STRATEGIES WITH REGARDS TO HOW DO WE FIND. A FUTURE -- SEGMENTS OF THE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. OF SPEED SYSTEM -- BY BEING ABLE TO SELL -- BY FRANCHISE WHAT WE'VE ALREADY WHAT WE'RE ALREADY OPERATING ON SO OUR WHOLE FOCUS IS. WE IS HEADING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE BAY AREA. BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE OF EITHER GOING NORTH OR SOUTH ALRIGHT. AND I I THINK BY -- LAST. LINE OF QUESTIONING IS IS AT TWO AS TO MY EARLIER CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE AUDITOR ABOUT -- THE STATE. TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HOLDING CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS ACCOUNTABLE -- FOR ANY OF THE PAST COST OVERRUNS OR THE PROJECT DELAYS -- WE WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S ASSESSMENT THAT. TO THAT -- AS FAR AS THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF OF A CONTRACTOR BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF A CORRECTIVE ACTION IS SHE BEING ISSUE WHEN WE ACTUALLY. IN IS THAT WOULD BE THE POLICY OF THIS BOARD THAT WE THAT THERE THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HELD THAT'S MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS AT EIGHT WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF OF CORRECTION CORRECTIVE ACTION BEING TAKEN. NO SIR NO I YEAH I DON'T I DON'T WE HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT WE SENT OVER -- AND GET IS -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT THINK OF COMMUNICATION HERE THE GARCIA CORRECTIVE ACTION DEFINITION OF DELIVERABLES. BUT THERE'S BEEN OVER. A DOZEN LETTERS SENT TO THE R. E. P. WITH REGARDS TO PERFORMANCE. AND I KNOW THERE'S MORE THERE'S A LEAST ONE BECAUSE I PERSONALLY SIGNED WENT OUT TO THE PRESIDENT OF W. S. P. ON THIS EXACT ISSUE. SO AGAIN IS IT IT IT'S IT'S APPLE LEVEL OF THE CEO AND THE SEAL. ALRIGHT SO -- ALL RIGHT WELL. I'M LIKE TO PASS OUT ITS A WIN OF THE BENEFITS OF OF THIS AUDIT COMMISSIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT WE HAVE -- FIRST YEAR AGREEMENT -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS ACCEPTING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE THE AUDITOR -- AND THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC -- TIME LINES AND BENCHMARKS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO REPORT BACK -- AND SO. WE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES DEMONSTRATED PROGRESS AND IT STATED COMMITMENT -- TO ADOPT ALL OF THE AUDITOR'S. RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. YOU EVER THINK YOU'D THINK YOU'D. LIKE TO OPEN UP -- FOR FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS -- BEFORE WE START WANT. TO ASK YOU THAT EACH SPEAKER KEEP THE COMMENTS TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROLAND ROAD BROWN I'M FROM SAN JOSE AND THE REASON I'M A ADDRESSING YOU IS THAT I BELIEVE. WE CAN CONNECTS TO LINCOLN VALLEY TO FRESNO WITHIN THE EXISTING FUNDING APOLO WHICH ON THE THAN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. BUT WE REALLY GOT TO START RETHINKING MY WHAT WHAT YOU DOING SO I HAVE PREPARED A FEW THINGS HERE. NOW THE ONE THING IS THAT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND I'M GONNA TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU IN TWO MINUTES WITHOUT ON THEIR CREDENTIALS. MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU AND OPPOSE OF AN INDEPENDENT ENGINEERING ALL DATA. NOT JUST ANOTHER PEER REVIEW PANEL. SO -- VERY BRIEFLY IN THE NORTH -- I'M GOING TO GO OVER IT IS VERY QUICKLY I'M VERY FRUSTRATED DAY BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY OF JUST APPROVED AND ALIGNMENTS. THAT. MANDATES TWENTY EIGHT MILES OF TUNNELS BETWEEN BURBANK IN PALMDALE. COMPLETELY IGNORING THE FACT THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE KNEW HOW TO CONNECT BURBANK TO BAKERSFIELD WITH EIGHTEEN MILES OF TUNNELS. NOT ONLY THAT WE HAD THE NOT GREAT A LYMAN THAT CROSSES THE FOLD AND PROVIDED THE CONNECTIVITY TO OUR LANCASTER AND PALMDALE -- NOW MOVING TO THE NOLES. I BELIEVE I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH FAMILY TO GET WELL AND AND I AM THANKFUL TO DEAL THIRTY FOR LISTENING TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO IS TO CONTINUE WHAT WE STOPPED IT.% AND GO TO HOLLISTER THE THE LINES ALREADY EIGHT UNION PACIFIC SOLD A LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHY AREN'T WE USING IT. AND THEN AFTER THAT. FORGET BUDGET DEAL BASS FORGET THE TWELVE MILES OF TUNNELS USE PAN NO J. PASS. THESE LITTLE ALL NEW COMING REQUIRED. TO AND WHAT GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THAT BY THE TIME YOU GET -- TO I FIVE YOUNG NOW 440- MILES SOUTH OF IF YOU CARRY ON DOWN I FIVE YOU SEE IF TWELVE MINUTES. BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES WHICH YOU CAN CARRY ON THREE TO FRESNO. AND NOW GUESS WHAT MORE BLENDING. THE NOT YOUR THREE G. DID NOT KNOW. THAT IT WAS A LINE TO MEN DON'T. THANK YOU SIR. JUST SAID I JUST SENT OVER FROM AMERICA NOTE SHE PASSIVELY. I WORKED UP ON A CATTLE RANCH WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER OF US. I HATED THAT WORK ACROSS. IS REAL HOT AND DRY IT. BUT I I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE THAT AREA. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OKAY HENRY PRAYER FORMER FRESNO COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND VERY INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT FOR SEVEN YEARS WHILE I WAS A SUPERVISOR. FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR FOR INITIATING THIS REPORT I THINK IT'S IT'S WHITES IS TIMELY AND IS JUST SETS THE PATH FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS I BELIEVE ON ON THIS PROJECT. THE THEY DO IDENTIFY STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT ARE JUST TOUCH ON REAL BRIEFLY AT THE END BUT I JUST WANT TO DISAGREE SLIGHTLY AND THAT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA TO START A CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK WAS ABSOLUTELY. A GREAT IDEA FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT ALREADY BEEN STATUS I WON'T RESTATE THEM. BUT BUT CERTAINLY -- BEING INVOLVED IN COMING TO MAY TEENS WHERE THE DECISION MAKING WAS MADE TO MAKE THOSE FIRST STEPS IT WAS A DELIBERATE PROCESS AND THERE WAS SOLID BACKGROUND TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO. I WILL SUPPORT VERY GOOD DECISION TO START A CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- OR IS. WHO IS NOT HERE BUT YOU KNOW KEPT TALKING ABOUT SPEED TIME AND COMPETITIVENESS AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO SEE THAT IN ANYTHING THAT THAT WE DO -- BUT AS HE WAS SPEAKING AND OTHER FOLKS MAKING COMMENT I GOT ON MY EXPEDIA COUNTY AND I LOOKED AT A FLIGHT FROM FRESNO FROM ON DECEMBER FIRST COMING BACK ON DECEMBER THIRD. FOR FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS. YOU COULD GET THERE IN SEVEN HOURS AND SIX BENEFIT TO STOP FRESNO TO SAN FRANCISCO TO LAS VEGAS. TO LOS ANGELES NOW YEAH THE TWO HOURS WAITING TIME GOING TO THE AIRPORT THAT'S OVER NINE HOURS TO GET DAILY FROM FRESNO. BUT IF YOU WANT TO PAY EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS. ARE YOU CAN TAKE A DIRECT FLIGHT FOR AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES AT THE TWO HOURS OF WAIT TIME NOW YOU HAVE THREE HOURS -- TO GET FROM FRESNO LA FOR FOR THAT MUCH MONEY SO I THINK IT UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT. THIS PROJECT HAS MANY MANY BENEFITS TO IT AND AND A LOT OF IT IS THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT GIVES US TO CONNECT IN THIS OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHICH IS WHY. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO START IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO GIVE THAT CONNECTIVITY. AND OF THE SOLOMON ARAMBULA SAID WHEN YOU GET IN THE AT FIFTY FIVE TO FIFTY EIGHT MINUTES IS A GAME CHANGER FOR US ECONOMIC SO. BUT DOESN'T MEAN WE WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY -- HOW WE COULD PUT THE MONIES TOGETHER? TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A NO BRAINER NOT JUST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEFORE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LETTER THE LETTING I JUST SAY I'M SORRY VERY BRIEFLY IT IS THAT. IS THAT -- THE THE THE ISSUE OF STRUCTURAL. VERY BIG ISSUE AND HAVING BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR MANY YEARS. WHEN YOU HAD WHEN YOU HAVE A 20% AUTHORITY NOW A SHOCK ACTUALLY BE HERE THAT NUMBER TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET THAT JOB DONE WHEN YOU HAVE THAT HIGH VACANCY RATE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO FILL A? POSITION IN ANY GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE SIX TO NINE MONTHS IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU CAN OPERATE THAT WAY -- SO IF I WERE TO ASK YOU TO TO USE THE AUTHORITY YOU HAVE AS THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SYSTEMIC CHANGES WITHIN THE STATE BUREAUCRACY WEATHER'S DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES OR OR HUMAN RESOURCES. CHANGE THE PROCESSES MAKE THEM AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY THESE FOLKS THE ABILITY TO HIRE PEOPLE QUICKLY SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE JOB DONE. BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR THIS HEARING AND THANK SILVA. THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL MURPHY I'M CEO OF SORE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTING. AND IT'S ACTUALLY IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I SORT OF THE COMPANY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ALMOST LEFT -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR THE PURPOSES THAT YOU DESCRIBED EARLIER WHICH WAS THERE WASN'T MUCH OPPORTUNITY THERE. LIKELY I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND BECAME THE ENVIRONMENTAL -- OVERSIGHT MANAGER FOR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. ONE WITH THAT I WORK WITH A SMALL BUSINESS DIED LEADS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUILT MY COMPANY MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE I THINK FOURTEEN OF MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH THE END OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FIVE OF WHICH ARE WITH THE TOP TEN ENVIRONMENT FIRMS IN THE COUNTRY. AND ALSO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE -- FOURTEEN EMPLOYEES AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO BE BRINGING ON TO MORE THAN. TWENTY NINETEEN SO THE SMALL BUSINESS PORTION OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS WORKING. IT'S ALLOWING ME TO STAY IN THE AREA THAT I WANT TO HIRE THOSE PEOPLE THAT -- THAT I BELIEVE. IS MY COMMUNITY OBLIGATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY KEEP THOSE PEOPLE IN IN TOWN WHERE THEIR FRIENDS ARE WHERE THEIR FAMILIES ARE. AND MAKE A CAREER THERE SO I JUST WANT TO COME UP AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THOSE SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES. AND KNOW THAT. WERE TIED TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHORITY YOU KNOW AS A SMALL BUSINESS AS A CONSULTING FIRM WHAT WE DO. IS IS BY REPUTATION AND OUR REPUTATION IS TIED TO THE AUTHORITY SO WE WORK AS HARD AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS. OF THE AUTHORITY AND THE PROJECT THAT WE REPRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS -- WE LIKE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE STILL HERE FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME EVERYONE TOOK TO COME HERE AND TESTIFY TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUARTERLY REPORTS -- THE LARGEST THE AUTHORITY WILL BE SUBMITTING TO LEGISLATURE STARTING IN JANUARY -- I BELIEVE ME I'LL BE SCRUTINIZING THEM. ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THE AUTHORITY BOARD ON THE PROGRESS MADE TOWARD ADDRESSING THE ISSUES IN THE AUDIT IN THE NOT ACCEPTING. THAT THERE ARE INITIAL. PROBLEMS GOING FORWARD. LASTLY I WANT TO STRESS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING TO US [inaudible] FOR ANSWERS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY CONSTITUENTS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT THEY'RE DOING ARE THAT WE ARE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND BEING RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF THEIR MONEY. IN I WILL ENSURE YOU THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR IS GOING TO BE A VIGOROUS YEAR OF OVERSIGHT PLUS. CORRECTIVE LEGISLATION. OF LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS IS BACK IN THE YOUR TO AGO THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS LET GO FROM THE AUTHORITY. THAT WAS JEFF ROUSE. I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE. JEFF WAS A PROJECT A AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THE THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE TOP. I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD DAN RICHARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN LET GO. AS AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR ALTMAN OVERSIGHT OF ALL OF THIS FIASCO HAS BEEN GOING ON AND FOR THAT I CALL FOR HIS RESIGNATION GOING FORWARD. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE UNDERSTAND THAT AT LEAST THERE WAS ONE ACTION TAKEN. IN THE APPROPRIATE FASHION FOR THIS GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK THE BOARD NEEDS TO LOOK FORWARD. TO BETTER BETTER REPRESENTATION FROM THE CHAIRMAN BUT ALSO KNOWING THAT. THEY HIRED A CONSTRUCTION STE I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN WHAT JOE AND THE TIME THAT HE AND I SPENT TOGETHER. I HAVE A FEELING THAT HE HAS AN ABILITY TO BRING THIS BACK ON TRACK. BUT SOMEBODY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO GO. THAT MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU. FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH OUR VOICE INTO THIS. AND THAT -- LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND SENATOR BILL. OF MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE'S MONEY SPENT CORRECTLY AND THEY GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY PAY FOR THANK YOU. HI THANKS THE AUDITOR FOR COMPLETING DAUGHTER THAT WE REQUESTED -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE FOLLOW UP ON THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS WE WANT THEM ALL IMPLEMENTED. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I THINK THE THE TROUBLE SOME -- ISSUE FOR ME IS MAINLY A HIRING THE STAFF. GETTING THE STAFF TO STATE. AND RETAIN A GOOD QUALITY TEAM. OF I I KNOW THIS THIS COULD BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE JOB. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DESIRE. TO DO A SIGNATURE JOB AND THEY'RE COOL YOUR FOR AS A PROJECT MANAGER SO I THINK. I THINK THIS -- COULD BE AN EXCITING JOB WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR OUR TOP LEVEL -- PEOPLE ARE PAID OUT QUICKLY SO THAT. WE CAN RECRUIT AND NOT. HAVE -- RETENTION PROBLEMS IN -- HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WE WANT A TEAM THAT STICKS TOGETHER AND COMPLETES THE PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET -- AND ANYTHING WE KNEW TO REMOVE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR ON TIME AND ON BUDGET ON ON ON TIME AND ON BUDGET -- GOAL SHOULD BE TAKEN -- AND RECOMMENDED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR INCLUDING AS MR FRAZIER SAYS LEGISLATION THAT WE WOULD. REVEAL IN OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES I ALSO THINK -- INCREASED OVERSIGHT WOULD BE IS ESSENTIAL -- WE WILL WORK -- TOGETHER -- WITH -- AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE INCREASED OVERSIGHT. AND SEE THAT -- THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETED ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. WE MUST -- WE MUST LOOK AT CREATIVE WAYS OF FINANCING AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS AN AREA OF OF THE AUDIT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLORED MORE FULLY. AND NO -- WE WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT INCREASING OUR OUR LOOK AT HOW WE FINANCE AND COMPLETE THIS PROJECT. AS I SAID EARLIER I THINK THE NASH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL -- CALIFORNIA IS KIND OF GOING AHEAD AND TAKEN THE CAKE AND THE LEAD -- IN FINANCING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE NEED A NATIONAL LEADERS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND NOT CONTRIBUTE TO INFRASTRUCTURE IN UNITED STATES. THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO FAR BUT WE WE URGE CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT -- TO COME TOGETHER ON A A QUALITY -- BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST -- MANY YEARS AGO THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO GET TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. IT WOULD -- IT WOULD BE A GOOD BIPARTISAN MOVE ON TO BUY BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE A A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. INCLUDING -- RAIL TRANSIT ALL THE NEEDS IN INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING AND I THINK TO BE DONE SO -- TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND HARD WORK. ON ON CAN A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE -- YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AUDIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALASKA -- LIKE I'D JUST LIKE TO THINK ABOUT CHAIRMAN OF OF THE COMMITTEES OF TRANSPORTATION IN BOTH HOUSES -- MISS FRAZIER AND SOME REBEL. THANK YOU SAID AT THE STATE AUDITOR -- I THINK THIS. AUDIT IS GOING TO BE -- A BENCHMARK THAT THE THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE REFERRING -- TO FOR FOR YEARS TO COME IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE ESPECIALLY AS WE APPROACH SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT. TO DEADLINES THAT TO WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE IN THE AUDIT REPORT -- LOOK FORWARD. TO A STRONGER -- YOU KNOW -- COMMITMENT -- TO INCREASED OVERSIGHT ACTIVITY NOT ONLY THAT'S REQUIRED THROUGH THE FOLLOW UPS THROUGH FOR FROM THE THE STATE AUDITOR AND AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY -- BUT ALSO FROM THE QUARTERLY RECOMMENDED A TO THE LEGISLATURE AND OF COURSE THE CONTINUE LEADERSHIP FROM BOTH -- CHAIRMAN OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES OF BOTH HOUSES. I FOR ONE I BELIEVE THAT -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. TO REGAIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR ABILITY TO TO EXECUTE THIS PROJECT. HI BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. YOU KNOW A A COMMITMENT AND OF AND OF REDOUBLED FOCUS ON THIS VALLEY TO VALLEY PROJECT AND THAT THIS COMPONENT. TO GET THAT DONE TO DEMONSTRATE TO CALIFORNIANS THAT WE CAN -- YOU KNOW GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT RIGHT BEEN INVESTED IN THIS PROJECT. AND TO SEE WERE AT AFTER THAT -- SO WITH THAT. I SEEING NO -- FOR THE COMMENTS -- THIS LIKE THE LA INSURANCE MEETING
