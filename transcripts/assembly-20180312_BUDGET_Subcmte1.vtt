KNOW WHAT WILD WICKED THAT. ONE

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:24.056 region:rollup2
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL

ESTIMATED BY THE YOU FTA.

00:30:27.726 --> 00:30:31.063 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE FINANCIALLY AT A

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:32.397 region:rollup2
HUGE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CHEN

00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:34.366 region:rollup2

AND RICK

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.871 region:rollup2
BOB ALSO SERVES THAT WOULD LIKE

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:41.306 region:rollup2
TO POINT OUT IS THE SMALL

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.941 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE LARGE

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:45.210 region:rollup2
FOOD BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HELP

AND MEAT ALL BRICK REQUIREMENTS

00:30:46.478 --> 00:30:49.581 region:rollup2
SO WE CARE EQUALLY ABOUT EACH OF

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.749 region:rollup2
THESE GROUPS.

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:52.417 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD IS A

00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:54.286 region:rollup2
MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:55.854 region:rollup2
OF HEALTH WHIPS GOAL IS TO

00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:57.255 region:rollup2
INSURE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:58.557 region:rollup2

BABIES AND CHILDREN AFTER A

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:01.493 region:rollup2
GREAT START.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:02.527 region:rollup2
SO MY JOB IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:03.829 region:rollup2
IS TO WEAVE THESE THREE

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:05.831 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS A VERY VERY

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:07.499 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY BOTH FISCALLY. AND

00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:09.701 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC LEAD TO BELIEVE

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:10.736 region:rollup2
THEM TO NOT ONLY SEE HOW WE CAN

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.871 region:rollup2
MEET CURRENT NEEDS BUT

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:15.507 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE ON OTHER FAMILY

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:16.942 region:rollup2
ISSUES AS THEY AND OTHER FAMILY

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:17.809 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AS THEY ARRIVE.

00:31:16.942 --> 00:31:19.611 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T WANT A REPEAT THE

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:20.579 region:rollup2
SUMMARY THAT'S IN YOUR BINDER I

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.747 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD ADVICE ON

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:23.915 region:rollup2
A TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A BROAD

00:31:21.747 --> 00:31:24.850 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF HOW WE'RE ORGANIZED

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:27.185 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE CAN GO INTO MORE

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.253 region:rollup2
DETAIL. ON IN THE OTHER PARTS OF

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:29.388 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTERS.

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:30.722 region:rollup2
THERE WAS ONE QUESTION THAT WAS

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:32.224 region:rollup2
DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO ME AND

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.358 region:rollup2
THAT WAS HOW MUCH FEDERAL

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:35.594 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO BE

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:37.362 region:rollup2
MATCHED WITH ADDITIONAL STATE

00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:38.830 region:rollup2
FUNDING. FOR FLP.

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:40.799 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ALL OVER FEDERAL

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:42.334 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT I THAT I'VE TALKED

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:43.969 region:rollup2
ABOUT ISLAM ALREADY BEEN

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:45.337 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED SO WE HAVE IN A DISH

00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:46.405 region:rollup2
WE DON'T.

00:31:45.337 --> 00:31:48.073 region:rollup2
WE HELPED TO MANAGE TITLE

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:49.508 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SO WE HAVE TITLE FIVE

00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:51.209 region:rollup2
IN THAT'S ARGUMENT ALLOCATED AND

00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:51.743 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TITLE NINETEEN MONEY AND

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:54.246 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY HELP THAT

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:55.147 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED. BUT WITH ADDITIONAL

00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:57.816 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDING THERE WOULD BE YET

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:59.384 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ALL POTENTIAL TO ON.

00:31:57.816 --> 00:32:00.452 region:rollup2
I'M NOT STATE FEDERAL FUND

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:02.387 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WITH TITLE NINETEEN

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:04.556 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BUT WE'RE CURRENTLY HAVE

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:07.325 region:rollup2
ALL APART MODEL FEDERAL FUNDS

00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:10.028 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOCATED.

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:12.764 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT.

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:14.366 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.334 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:18.036 region:rollup2
THE DYESS I WANTED TO DRILL DOWN

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:20.872 region:rollup2
ON THE QUESTION IF I COULD IT

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:22.407 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE DURING RECESSION WE

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:23.942 region:rollup2
CUT STATE FUNDING.

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:25.477 region:rollup2
AND THAT DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:26.978 region:rollup2
FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDING THAT WE

00:32:25.477 --> 00:32:29.181 region:rollup2
WERE RECEIVING.

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:31.316 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS IF WE WERE TO

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.051 region:rollup2
INCREASE STATE FUNDING TO HELP

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:35.620 region:rollup2
WITH THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY.

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:37.389 region:rollup2
PAT LIFE PROGRAM WOULD WE BE

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.790 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FURTHER

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:40.725 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDS AND IF SO AT WHAT

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.560 region:rollup2
RATE.

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.994 region:rollup2
AYE THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.096 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR TO IS THE TITLE

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:45.764 region:rollup2
NINETEEN DOLLARS AND SUBTITLE

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:48.900 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:50.769 region:rollup2
WILL MATCH STATE GENERAL FUNDS

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.672 region:rollup2
OR LOCAL STATE OR LOCAL GENERAL

00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:54.739 region:rollup2
FUNDS ON IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE.

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:56.942 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:59.177 region:rollup2
SO IF WE HAD THAT MONEY AND WE

00:32:56.942 --> 00:33:02.047 region:rollup2
HAD THE LOCALS WILLING TO COMMIT

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:03.582 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TIME THAT WOULD BE ON.

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:06.318 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR TITLE NINETEEN

00:33:03.582 --> 00:33:07.953 region:rollup2
WE COULD THEN SEEK ADDITIONAL

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.955 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDING.

00:33:07.953 --> 00:33:11.690 region:rollup2
I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS

00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:13.625 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IF WE WERE TO

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.227 region:rollup2
INCLUDE INCREASED FUNDING TO

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:16.628 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM.

00:33:15.227 --> 00:33:18.930 region:rollup2
WOULD WE GET DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR

00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:22.067 region:rollup2
MATCH FROM FEDERAL FUNDS OR IS

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.401 region:rollup2
THERE. A SPECIFIC RATE.

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:25.337 region:rollup2
IT WHAT'S TURKEY ABOUT AND NOT A

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:27.539 region:rollup2
LET LESLIE ANSWER TO IS THAT WE

00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:29.941 region:rollup2
HAVE A TOTAL POT THAT WE CAN

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:31.643 region:rollup2
ALLOCATE TO THE WHOLE STATE.

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:33.078 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE

00:33:31.643 --> 00:33:34.646 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:36.248 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS BALANCE

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:38.049 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF AFL PIECE.

00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:40.151 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN ABLE

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:41.953 region:rollup2
TO USE TITLE NINETEEN DOLLARS TO

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:43.421 region:rollup2
ENHANCE A FLP STATE GENERAL

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:45.524 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:47.058 region:rollup2
WE COULD FEASIBLY DO THAT FOR

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:49.828 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE TO AND THEN IT WOULD

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:51.429 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON HOW THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:33:49.828 --> 00:33:54.199 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS DEEPAK.

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:55.667 region:rollup2
DECIDE TO USE THOSE DOLLARS IF

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:57.035 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USING THEM WITH A HIGH

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:58.003 region:rollup2
LEVEL CLINICAL PERSON LIKE IN

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:59.404 region:rollup2
NURSES A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY

00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:01.640 region:rollup2
FIVE.

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:03.141 region:rollup2

THOSE AREAS IS AND RESEARCH.

00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:59.557 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:01.626 region:rollup2

THAT.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.666 region:rollup2
AND FACT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:10.969 region:rollup2

HOPEFULLY WE COULD HAVE DONE

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.776 region:rollup2

SPEND THE REBATE FUNDS FIRST.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.811 region:rollup2
COST DRIVERS FOR THE PROGRAM ARM

BE THREE HUNDRED ONE MILLION

00:53:59.203 --> 00:54:01.939 region:rollup2

FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:11.415 region:rollup2
THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:12.983 region:rollup2
FACING THE PROGRAM. AND THAT WU

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:14.184 region:rollup2
WILL BE OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IN THE

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:15.486 region:rollup2
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ARE

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:17.321 region:rollup2
DECLINING PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:18.889 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND TRANSITION TO E.

00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:20.090 region:rollup2
BITI THE ELECTRONIC BENEFITS

TRANSFER.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.962 region:rollup2
SO YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:26.563 region:rollup2
WHERE SPOT OR SPOT ON THEIR.

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:28.132 region:rollup2
I'M IS QUESTION NUMBER ONE WHICH

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:30.801 region:rollup2
ELECTED JUST TO GO THROUGH EACH

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:31.835 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTIONS. YES PART OF.

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:33.604 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS KNOWN AT THIS POINT

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:35.606 region:rollup2
ABOUT DECREASING PARTICIPATION

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:37.207 region:rollup2
SO AS WE'VE REPORTED IN THE PAST

00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:39.276 region:rollup2
A WICK PROGRAM PARTICIPATION HAS

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:40.377 region:rollup2
BEEN DECLINING SINCE ABOUT TWO

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:42.613 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE AND IT'S

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:43.780 region:rollup2
DECLINING BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.983 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.651 region:rollup2
USDA REPORT OUT PRODUCES AN

00:54:45.983 --> 00:54:49.653 region:rollup2
ANNUAL REPORT WHERE THEY

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:51.355 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:52.623 region:rollup2
AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO WHAT A

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:53.957 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STATES HAVE SERVED TO

00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:54.758 region:rollup2
CREATE THE PROGRAM WHAT THEY

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.293 region:rollup2
CALL PROGRAM REACH.

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:58.128 region:rollup2
AND

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.329 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO FEBRUARY

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.964 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTH THEIR LOAD LATEST

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:03.634 region:rollup2
REPORT CAME OUT USING TWENTY

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:05.502 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN DATA. AT THAT FOR USING

00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:07.137 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN DATA THE NATIONAL

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:08.739 region:rollup2
AVERAGE FOR PROGRAM REACH WAS

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.874 region:rollup2
FIFTY TWO PERCENT AND

00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:12.075 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER IS SIXTY

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:14.545 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT SO WE. OVER THE

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:16.580 region:rollup2
PAST.

00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:18.348 region:rollup2
TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AT LEAST.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.918 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS TYPICALLY BEEN

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:22.219 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT.

00:55:20.918 --> 00:55:23.987 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE THE

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:25.189 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AVERAGE AND WE CONTINUE

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:27.090 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PROGRAM

00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:28.759 region:rollup2
REACH OF ALL STATES.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.127 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OUR PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:31.728 region:rollup2
DECLINING OVER THE PAST FEW

00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:33.997 region:rollup2
YEARS SO THAT WE KNOW WE DEFTLY

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:35.532 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE WORK TO DO THERE.

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:37.668 region:rollup2
THERE'D BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:39.603 region:rollup2
AND SURVEYS ASKING POTENTIAL

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:41.538 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS OR PASSED

00:55:39.603 --> 00:55:42.873 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS Y. THEY DIDN'T COME

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:44.107 region:rollup2
TO WECKER DIDN'T STAY IN WORK

00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:45.642 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THOSE.

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:47.010 region:rollup2
REASONS INCLUDE THEY DIDN'T

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:48.512 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY WERE THEY WOULD

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.379 region:rollup2
QUALIFY SO ONE OF THE THINGS

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:50.881 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING ON JUST A

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:52.749 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE IS. REALLY

00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:55.118 region:rollup2
TAILORING OUR MESSAGE TO THE

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:56.153 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT COME UP

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.221 region:rollup2
FROM THE SURVEYS

00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:58.622 region:rollup2
SO THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE

00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:00.123 region:rollup2
QUALIFY MAYBE THERE ARE WORKING

00:55:58.622 --> 00:56:01.458 region:rollup2
FAMILY THAT THOUGHT THAT IF YOU

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:02.960 region:rollup2
HAVE A JOB YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.461 region:rollup2
THE WITH PROGRAM.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.796 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY NEEDED

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:07.331 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM SO THAT COMES UP

00:56:05.796 --> 00:56:08.966 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT EVEN THOUGH

00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:10.801 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THESE RESPONDENTS

00:56:08.966 --> 00:56:12.135 region:rollup2
INDICATE THAT THEY DO HAVE FOOD

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:13.704 region:rollup2
INSECURITY ISSUES THEY STILL

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:15.138 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THEY NEEDED THE

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:16.206 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OR THEY WANT TO. MAKE

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:17.474 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:19.042 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR OTHER FAMILIES

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:20.477 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE MORE IN NEED THAN

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.346 region:rollup2
THEY ARE.

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:25.082 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

00:56:22.346 --> 00:56:26.516 region:rollup2
AS HIGH. UP ON THE RESPONSE LIST

00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:27.351 region:rollup2
AS THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUTWORKS

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:29.119 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW

00:56:27.351 --> 00:56:30.487 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHICH IS THE SPECIFICS OF

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:31.822 region:rollup2
WHERE TO GO ON WHO QUALIFIES

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:33.523 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE NEED

00:56:31.822 --> 00:56:34.191 region:rollup2
TO. DO MORE WORK THERE. AND

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:36.627 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER.

00:56:34.191 --> 00:56:38.061 region:rollup2
ACCESS ISSUES TRANSPORTATION TO

00:56:36.627 --> 00:56:39.363 region:rollup2
THE WORK SITE OR TIME

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS ABOUT COMING TO AN

00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:42.332 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:43.433 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:45.769 region:rollup2
TO DO ADDRESS PROGRAM

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:46.203 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION AND WE'RE FOCUSED

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.871 region:rollup2
ON THREE DIFFERENT.

00:56:46.203 --> 00:56:50.073 region:rollup2
.

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:51.808 region:rollup2
GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS ONE IS

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:53.443 region:rollup2
RETAINING OUR ACTIVE.

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.878 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.013 region:rollup2
HAVE COME INTO THE WORK PROGRAM

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:57.214 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CERTIFIED THEY'RE

00:56:56.013 --> 00:56:58.715 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY RECEIVING THEIR WHAT

00:56:57.214 --> 00:57:00.083 region:rollup2
CHECKS.

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:01.785 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.520 region:rollup2
THEY STAY IN THE PROGRAM.

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:05.222 region:rollup2
SECOND IS RE ENGAGING FAMILIES

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.356 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CERTIFIED BUT NO LONGER

00:57:05.222 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY COMING BACK TO RECEIVE

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:09.359 region:rollup2
THEIR CHECKS.

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.327 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A PERCENTAGE THAT HAS

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:12.462 region:rollup2
BEEN GROWING A LITTLE BIT OVER

00:57:10.327 --> 00:57:13.530 region:rollup2
THE PAST FEW YEARS.

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:16.066 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD GROUP IS

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:17.768 region:rollup2
RECRUITING ELIGIBLE FAMILIES

00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:19.436 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT CERTIFIED AWAKE BUT

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AS WELL

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:22.272 region:rollup2
THAT THIS LAST GROUP RECRUITING

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:23.907 region:rollup2
NEW FAMILIES. THEY MAYHAVE BEEN

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.709 region:rollup2
IN THE WITH PROGRAM IN THE PAST

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:26.276 region:rollup2
SO IT MAY BE THAT THE BABY

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:27.377 region:rollup2
WASN'T WAS ENROLLED AND WAKE

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:29.479 region:rollup2
AND%

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:31.148 region:rollup2
NOW THAT CHILD IS THREE OR FOUR

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.716 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD. AND SO THEY'RE NOT

00:57:31.148 --> 00:57:33.817 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY THEY'RE NOT CERTIFIED

00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:35.052 region:rollup2
ANYMORE BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:36.353 region:rollup2
WELL AWARE OF WAY BECAUSE THEY

00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:40.390 region:rollup2
WERE THERE COUPLE YEARS AGO OR

00:57:36.353 --> 00:57:41.758 region:rollup2
MAYBE WITH OF. AN EARLIER CHILD.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.460 region:rollup2
SO THINKING ABOUT THOSE THREE

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:44.361 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FAMILIES

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.296 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:57:44.361 --> 00:57:48.699 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:51.201 region:rollup2
KEY STRATEGY AREAS THE FIRST IS

00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:53.170 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING DATA AND RESEARCH.

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:54.972 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF THEM SO WE ANALYZE

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:56.206 region:rollup2
TRENDS WE CONDUCT STUDIES WE

00:57:54.972 --> 00:57:58.175 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND A LOT OF STUDIES THAT

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:59.609 region:rollup2
ARE HAPPENING IN AND THROUGHOUT

00:57:58.175 --> 00:58:01.378 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND NATIONAL. THERE'S

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:02.846 region:rollup2
LOTS OF INTEREST IN DOING THESE

00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:05.148 region:rollup2
TYPES OF REVIEWS SO WE WERE

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:06.450 region:rollup2
BEARING ABLE TO GET REPORTS FROM

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.617 region:rollup2
OTHER GROUPS TO UNDERSTAND MORE

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:09.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT PARTICIPATION

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:10.754 region:rollup2
DECLINES.

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:12.089 region:rollup2
A WE'VE PREPARED DATA AND GEO

00:58:10.754 --> 00:58:14.358 region:rollup2
MAPPING TOOLSFOR OUR LOCAL

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:15.592 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WE FUNDED LOCAL AGENCY

00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:17.828 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO CONDUCT AND

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:20.430 region:rollup2
EVALUATES INNOVATIVE PROJECTS.

00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:22.199 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND KEEFE STRATEGY IS RE

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:25.001 region:rollup2
REVIEWING THE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE

00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:26.036 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.571 region:rollup2
AND REMOVE BARRIERS SAW TALK

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:29.840 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WITH

00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:31.008 region:rollup2
MODERN COMMUNICATION AND THE

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.275 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS.

00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:34.177 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY I'M OUT REACHING

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:36.013 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS SO MAKING SURE

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:38.048 region:rollup2
THAT WE TAILOR OUR MESSAGE TO

00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:39.282 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THAT WHAT WE LEARNED

00:58:38.048 --> 00:58:42.953 region:rollup2
UNDER THE FIRST DATA AND.

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:45.322 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AREA.

00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:47.457 region:rollup2
I'LL GIVE IT UPDATE ABOUT EBT SO

00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:49.126 region:rollup2
WE ARE ON TRACK TO IMPLEMENT EBT

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:51.061 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF THE FEDERAL DEADLINE OF

00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:53.096 region:rollup2
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY.

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:54.231 region:rollup2
FROM THERE IS SOME REPORTS THAT

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:56.833 region:rollup2
COME OUT FROM DEPARTMENT OF

00:58:54.231 --> 00:58:58.368 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND OFFICIAL PROGRESS

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.902 region:rollup2
HOME PROJECT REPORTS THAT I

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:01.138 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:04.141 region:rollup2
LA O. RECEIVES A COPY OF THAT

00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:05.842 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ALL IT ALL GREEN SO

00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:07.511 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT.

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:09.112 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THE KEY REQUIREMENTS

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.781 region:rollup2
IN IMPLEMENTING EBT IS TO

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:12.215 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE I. T. SYSTEM THAT WE

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:14.017 region:rollup2
USE BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:15.819 region:rollup2
AGENCIES IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THREE

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:17.854 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW SO WE DO

00:59:15.819 --> 00:59:19.623 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REPLACE THAT. WE ARE NOT

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:21.591 region:rollup2
DESIGNING A NEW SYSTEM WHERE

00:59:19.623 --> 00:59:22.659 region:rollup2
PROCURING A WE'RE WORKING WITH%

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:24.561 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:27.164 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION WHICH IS WITHIN OUR

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:29.266 region:rollup2
AGENCY. AS THEY DID IN RFP LAST

00:59:27.164 --> 00:59:31.368 region:rollup2
YEAR AND WE HOPE TO ANNOUNCE THE

00:59:29.266 --> 00:59:32.702 region:rollup2
CONTRACT IN APRIL SO JUST IN A

00:59:31.368 --> 00:59:34.137 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:35.105 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCE WHAT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:36.173 region:rollup2
GETTING AND WHO THE CONTRACTOR

00:59:35.105 --> 00:59:37.741 region:rollup2
AS.

00:59:36.173 --> 00:59:39.943 region:rollup2
AND THIS WILL BE A SYSTEM THAT

00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:40.911 region:rollup2
IS BEEN USED IN. ANOTHER STATE

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.612 region:rollup2
FOR WORK SO THAT'S ONE THE

00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:44.514 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF USDA'S NOT TO

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.882 region:rollup2
BUILD A NEW SYSTEMS OR VERY

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:47.751 region:rollup2
HAPPY JUST TO TRANSFER SOMETHING

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:49.052 region:rollup2
WITH A CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE MIGHT

00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.887 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO SOME ENHANCEMENTS TO

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:52.522 region:rollup2
MEET THE NEEDS IN THE SCOPE OF

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:54.257 region:rollup2
THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA BUT.

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:56.393 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT I JUST

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:58.395 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

00:59:56.393 --> 01:00:00.197 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR FOCUS IS

00:59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.631 region:rollup2
SITTING SETTING UP AT NEW

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:03.800 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:05.268 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING TRAINING MATERIALS

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.704 region:rollup2
AND PROCESSES BOTH FOR THE STATE

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:09.406 region:rollup2
STAFF AND FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.240 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED LOCAL

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:11.708 region:rollup2
AGENCY SITES THROUGHOUT

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.276 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:15.245 region:rollup2
WORK TO DO. TO ROLL OUT THE NEW

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.080 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN THOSE STATES AND TRAIN

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:18.849 region:rollup2
STAFF AS WELL.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.518 region:rollup2
STARTING IN SUMMER TWENTY

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:23.753 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WHERE WE'LL BE PILOTING

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:25.689 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEM AN EBT SERVICES

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:27.023 region:rollup2
WILL START AND SOLANO COUNTY AND

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:28.825 region:rollup2
DO THAT AGAIN SUMMER OF TWENTY

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:30.827 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SO WERE. JUST A LITTLE

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.761 region:rollup2
BIT OF A YEAR AWAY FROM ACTUALLY

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:33.163 region:rollup2
HAVING EBT FOR WORKING

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.931 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:36.600 region:rollup2
AND THEN AFTER THE PILOT WILL DO

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:37.834 region:rollup2
A TIERED APPROACH ROLL OUT

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.402 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S OR NOT

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:41.738 region:rollup2
DOING EVERYBODY ALL AT ONCE WILL

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:43.540 region:rollup2
STAGGER IT SO IT'S A MUCH.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.008 region:rollup2
BETTER FLOW AND LESSONS LEARNED

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.610 region:rollup2
AS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:49.880 region:rollup2
AND WILL WE SHOULD COMPLETE THAT

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.648 region:rollup2
BY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.883 region:rollup2
OF IT THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.417 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND FAMILIES IS

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:55.986 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:58.054 region:rollup2
SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:59.789 region:rollup2
WE'RE ENGAGING LOCAL AGENCIES

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.124 region:rollup2
AND STORES ARE ARE AUTHORIZED

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:02.859 region:rollup2
VENDORS.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.127 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE A A WORK GROUP THAT

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.061 region:rollup2
WERE SETTING UP BOTH OF

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.363 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER GROUP WITH THE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.297 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED VENDORS TO THAT THEY

COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAMILIES

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.070 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IS CRITICALLY

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:18.208 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE OUR CONTACT FOR THE

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:20.043 region:rollup2
EBT SERVICES PROVIDER TO THAT'S

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.038 region:rollup2
THINK WITH MY CERTAINLY MAKE FOR

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.607 region:rollup2
SHORTER CERTIFICATION

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:52.408 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT WHICH IS PROBABLY

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:53.810 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE.

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:55.345 region:rollup2
I'M A BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.380 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO IMPROVE

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.581 region:rollup2
THE PROPHECIES ABOUT FOR THAT

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.316 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION POINT.

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:02.986 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS SO THAT THERE ARE

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:04.053 region:rollup2
FEWER BARRIERS TYROLEAN AWAKENED

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:05.555 region:rollup2
A HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:07.290 region:rollup2
ONE IS ALLOWING GRANT AND

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.790 region:rollup2
GRANDPARENTS AS CARETAKERS FROM

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.326 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.861 region:rollup2
USED TO BE THAT IF THERE IF THE

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.962 region:rollup2
PARENT WAS ON THE PROGRAM THAT

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.230 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE GRANDPARENT COULD BE

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:16.232 region:rollup2
ALTERED THAT BUT NOW YOU COULD

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.233 region:rollup2
HAVE BOTH AS. A OFFICIALLY

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
LISTED.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:20.870 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IS ADJUNCTIVE

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID BABIES.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.208 region:rollup2
SO WHEN A CHILD IS BORN IF MOM

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.543 region:rollup2
WAS ON MEDI CAL. THAN THEIR OF

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:27.710 region:rollup2
THEIR ALREADY COVERED BY

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.945 region:rollup2
MEDICARE FOR AWHILE BUT THEY

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.246 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT HAVE THEIR MEDICAL

01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:31.981 region:rollup2
CARD RIGHT AWAY.

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:33.249 region:rollup2
AND SO ON WITH WE NEEDED THEM TO

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:35.518 region:rollup2
WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE ABOUT MEDI

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:36.719 region:rollup2
CAL CARD OR WE WOULD PUT HOLDS

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:38.488 region:rollup2
ON THEIR BENEFITS AND THEY WOULD

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.657 region:rollup2
JUST GET INCREMENTAL BENEFITS

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:42.559 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE SAYING. YEAR

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:44.794 region:rollup2
COVERED BY THAT BY MOM'S

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:46.729 region:rollup2
MEDICAID JUST AS MEDI CAL WHAT

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.397 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICES AS WELL.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.531 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAME FROM LOCAL

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:50.199 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT MADE THAT

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:50.767 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION I THINK THEY'RE VERY

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:53.002 region:rollup2
HAPPY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:54.404 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.605 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THE TRACKING NUMBERS

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:58.174 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE SAME ON ALL THE CARDS

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:59.475 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
LET'S SEE IT MOM GETS THE

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:02.812 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARD AND THEN THE KIDS

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:04.981 region:rollup2
GET A CARD BUT THE THE NUMBERS

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:06.883 region:rollup2
ARE THE SAME.

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:07.650 region:rollup2
THAT I'M I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.252 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT ON THE MEDICARE PART

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:11.554 region:rollup2
NO.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:13.756 region:rollup2
IT'S USUALLY MOST TO HEALTH

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:15.425 region:rollup2
CARDS. THE.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.859 region:rollup2
THAT THE CODING NUMBERS ARE THE

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.895 region:rollup2
SAME FOR THE PARENTS AS FOR THE

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.763 region:rollup2
KIDS.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:22.532 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING IN THAT WAY IF IF

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.367 region:rollup2
MOM'S CARD IS THE SAME NUMBERS

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:25.268 region:rollup2
AS THE KIDS CARDS IN THE SYSTEM

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:27.503 region:rollup2
THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PUNCH

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:28.538 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBERS AND LOOK IT UP

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:33.610 region:rollup2

THERE'S THAT THERE'S A MODULE

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.575 region:rollup2
THAT START THAT STARTS FROM DAY

ONE ADDRESSING THEIR AT THE

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:36.946 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. INDICATORS THAT THE

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:38.280 region:rollup2
MODEL SETS OUT TO ACHIEVE AND

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE FALL IN THE WHEEL

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:44.853 region:rollup2
HOUSE OF OF ACES AND SOME OF

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:47.156 region:rollup2
THEM ARE ARE BROADER.

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:48.824 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:50.793 region:rollup2
YOU ANSWERED IT WELL ABOUT DSS

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:53.696 region:rollup2
BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WERE

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:55.898 region:rollup2
COMPLIMENTING. PROGRAMS AND NOT

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:58.467 region:rollup2
DUPLICATING HOW CAN I. HAVE

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:59.835 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE THAT.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:01.937 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:04.573 region:rollup2
THREE TO TWENTY THREE COUNTIES

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:06.041 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE RAN. IT. HOW HOW DO

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:08.010 region:rollup2
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.911 region:rollup2
BROADEST REACH POSSIBLE TO MAKE

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:10.746 region:rollup2
SURE THAT?

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:13.782 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE HOME VISITING

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.883 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE HELPING OUR YOUNG

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.951 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:17.386 region:rollup2
BUT NOW I RESPOND TO THAT

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:19.555 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY SIT ON THE

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:21.390 region:rollup2
STATE INTERAGENCY TEAM ON YOUTH

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:22.825 region:rollup2
AND CHILDREN AND THERE'S A WORK

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.959 region:rollup2
GROUP ON HOME VISITING AND SO.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:25.561 region:rollup2
BOTH OUR DEPARTMENT OUR

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.862 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND DEPARTMENT SOCIAL

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:27.863 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE ON THAT BUT THAT

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:29.698 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:31.634 region:rollup2
GOAL OF COORDINATION.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:32.067 region:rollup2
MOM I THINK THAT CHALLENGES ARE

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:33.535 region:rollup2
GOING TO REALLY BE.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:35.070 region:rollup2
.

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:36.438 region:rollup2
AND THE INITIAL START UP PHASE

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:37.673 region:rollup2
WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCIES BECAUSE

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:39.375 region:rollup2
THEY WILL HAVE THE

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:41.844 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF TRYING TO.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:43.879 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE THE PAIR THE YOUNG

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:44.246 region:rollup2
PARENTS THE PREGNANT AND

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.280 region:rollup2
PARENTING WOMEN.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:47.249 region:rollup2
.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.284 region:rollup2
THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:51.086 region:rollup2
MAYBE TRIAGE THEM A LITTLE BIT

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:52.721 region:rollup2
AND TO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OUT WHERE MY BY WHERE MY

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.724 region:rollup2
THINK ALL WORKS LEARNING HOW TO

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.993 region:rollup2
DO SOME BRAIDED FUNDING WHERE

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:59.561 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE CAN EXPAND. ON THE

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:02.231 region:rollup2
UNIVERSE OF.

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:02.698 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS USING. FUNDING

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.099 region:rollup2
STRATEGY SO.

01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:05.200 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDST

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.801 region:rollup2
OF TRYING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.670 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK THE

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.138 region:rollup2
PRIMARY GOAL IS TO SUPPORT OUR

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:10.539 region:rollup2
LOCAL AGENCIES.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:12.841 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS FUNDING

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:14.209 region:rollup2
TO MAXIMISE ON THE ENROLLMENT OF

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.643 region:rollup2

SCREENED UNDER EP STT?

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.724 region:rollup2
AND WOULD HOPE THAT THE UPCOMING

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:30.592 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR HOME

01:20:28.724 --> 01:20:34.463 region:rollup2
VISITING PROGRAM CAN ALSO FIND

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:36.965 region:rollup2

HEPATITIS A IN THIS OUTBREAK

01:36:02.457 --> 01:36:05.660 region:rollup2
PERSONS EXPERIENCING

01:36:03.725 --> 01:36:08.062 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND OR ILLICIT DRUG

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.597 region:rollup2
USE. IS A VERY CHALLENGING

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:11.499 region:rollup2
POPULATION TO REACH.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:13.001 region:rollup2
THE CITY AND IS A GROUP MAY NOT

DELIVER YOUR PREVENTIVE SERVICES

01:36:14.836 --> 01:36:18.106 region:rollup2
IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY AND

01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:19.173 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR ISOLATION TO PREVENT

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:20.808 region:rollup2
DISEASE TRANSMISSION A VERY

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:22.844 region:rollup2
LIMITED.

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:24.545 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:36:22.844 --> 01:36:25.947 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THE LIVER VACCINE

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:27.382 region:rollup2
THIS OUTBREAK. WAS TAKING

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:28.850 region:rollup2
VACCINE INTO HOMELESS

01:36:27.382 --> 01:36:30.118 region:rollup2
ENCAMPMENTS

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:32.186 region:rollup2
THIS REQUIRED TEAMS OF THREE

01:36:30.118 --> 01:36:34.222 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH A NURSE TO PROVIDE

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:36.724 region:rollup2
THE VACCINE. A PEACE OFFICER FOR

01:36:34.222 --> 01:36:38.259 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN A COMMUNITY WORKER TO

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:40.328 region:rollup2
PROMOTE TRUST AND VEXING

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:41.796 region:rollup2
ACCEPTANCE AMONG THE POPULATION.

01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:42.730 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGES FOR THE

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:44.365 region:rollup2
CORRECTION WAS CRITICAL TO

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.900 region:rollup2
PROCURE VACCINES.

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:47.769 region:rollup2
ENSURE ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.570 region:rollup2
VACCINES AND FOR THE EFFECTIVE

01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:51.239 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF COMPLEX THINGS.

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:52.540 region:rollup2
QUESTION NUMBER THREE.

01:36:51.239 --> 01:36:53.808 region:rollup2
HOW COULD THE STATE RICH

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.410 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT HEPATITIS

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:57.278 region:rollup2
VACCINATION RATES TO ACCOMPLISH

01:36:55.410 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
HERD IMMUNITY?

01:36:57.278 --> 01:37:00.315 region:rollup2
HERD IMMUNITY IS ALREADY

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:01.549 region:rollup2
INCREASING USED THE

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:03.284 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES THE

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.519 region:rollup2
HAVE RECOMMENDED. THAT ALL

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:06.120 region:rollup2
CHILDREN RECEIVE HEPATITIS A

01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:07.789 region:rollup2
VACCINE.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.424 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION OF HEPATITIS A IN

01:37:07.789 --> 01:37:11.259 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HOUSE FALLING SHARPLY

01:37:09.424 --> 01:37:12.727 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. WHEN

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:13.995 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT THAT I CHILDHOOD

01:37:12.727 --> 01:37:16.531 region:rollup2
VACCINATION REQUIREMENT.

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:18.266 region:rollup2
THEREFORE DO THEY MOST CHILDREN

01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:21.836 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LISTEN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:23.905 region:rollup2
PROTECTED AGAINST HEPATITIS A.

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:25.273 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS WE KNOW SOME GROUPS

01:37:23.905 --> 01:37:26.541 region:rollup2
REMAIN A TIGHT RACE FOR

01:37:25.273 --> 01:37:28.342 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A TRANSMISSION

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:29.744 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ADULTS WHO ARE AT

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:31.179 region:rollup2
HIGH INTEREST OF EXPOSURE TO

01:37:29.744 --> 01:37:32.346 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS HAY.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:33.881 region:rollup2
THESE GROUPS INCLUDE HOMELESS

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:35.583 region:rollup2
PERSONS.

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:37.485 region:rollup2
PEOPLE USING ILLICIT DRUGS MEN

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:39.620 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AND PEOPLE

01:37:37.485 --> 01:37:41.189 region:rollup2
WHO TRAVEL TO COUNTRIES WHERE

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:43.524 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A IS COMMON.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:44.959 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND HER IMMUNITY TARGETED

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:48.196 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT AIRPORT FOR HIGH

01:37:44.959 --> 01:37:50.364 region:rollup2
RISK ADULTS WOULD BE REQUIRED.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:51.866 region:rollup2
AND QUESTION NUMBER FOUR. WHAT

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:53.568 region:rollup2
ARE THE PREDICTABLE RACING OFF

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:55.703 region:rollup2
INCREASE HEPATITIS A INCIDENCE

01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:57.538 region:rollup2
RATES IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:59.407 region:rollup2
INCREASING HOMELESS POPULATION?

01:37:57.538 --> 01:38:00.875 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK SOMEONE

01:37:59.407 --> 01:38:02.410 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PERSONS HAVE OCCURRED

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.711 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST BUT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:05.246 region:rollup2
UNCOMMON.

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:06.981 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN THE PAST TWO YEARS

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:09.717 region:rollup2
ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:11.519 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN HOMELESS

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:12.854 region:rollup2
PERSONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:38:11.519 --> 01:38:14.655 region:rollup2
HOUSE ALONG OF THAT ARE PERSONS

01:38:12.854 --> 01:38:16.657 region:rollup2
LIVING IN SITUATIONS WITH

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:17.592 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE HEIGHT YOU

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:18.059 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES AND SUNNY PATIENT.

01:38:17.592 --> 01:38:20.161 region:rollup2
AND LIMITED ACCESS TO

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:21.295 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:23.765 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE RISK OF HEPATITIS

01:38:21.295 --> 01:38:25.967 region:rollup2
OF HEPATITIS A TRANSMISSION. AS

01:38:23.765 --> 01:38:28.269 region:rollup2
WELL. AS TRANSMISSION OF ALL THE

01:38:25.967 --> 01:38:29.804 region:rollup2
DISEASES INCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS.

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:31.706 region:rollup2
CONCOMITANT RACE FACTORS LIKE

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:33.541 region:rollup2
DRUG USE INCREASE THE RISK OF

01:38:31.706 --> 01:38:35.510 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A SPREAD. AIN'T TO

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:37.345 region:rollup2
THIS RISK FOR OTHER THE SEASON

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.946 region:rollup2
SUCH AS HIV.

01:38:37.345 --> 01:38:40.515 region:rollup2
INCREASING HEPATITIS A IMMUNITY

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:42.016 region:rollup2
FROM COVERAGE

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:43.951 region:rollup2
WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:45.586 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS AND TRANSMISSION. BUT

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.854 region:rollup2
WILL BE DIFFICULT AND WILL NOT

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:48.189 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE RISK UP ON THE DE

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:49.223 region:rollup2
CSS.

01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:50.925 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING KEY UNDERLYING

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:51.426 region:rollup2
FACTORS

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:53.361 region:rollup2
SUCH AS ACCESS TO STABLE

01:38:51.426 --> 01:38:54.595 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:57.265 region:rollup2
DRUG TREATMENT AND MENTAL

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:59.133 region:rollup2
ILLNESS SERVICES RQ WAYS TO

01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:00.868 region:rollup2
DECREASE OVERALL RISK.

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:02.804 region:rollup2
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS ON

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:05.440 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A ALL YOU WANT TO

01:39:02.804 --> 01:39:06.073 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO. FESTIVITIES HAD

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.641 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE QUESTIONS ON HEPATITIS

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:08.376 region:rollup2
FIRST

01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:10.378 region:rollup2
I THINK I'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW

01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:12.280 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON HEPATITIS

01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:14.081 region:rollup2
IF I COULD YOUR TIME. AND I

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.250 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NEED TO BACK UP HALF A

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:18.186 region:rollup2
SECOND AND TELL YOU PART OF THE

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:19.420 region:rollup2
REASON WHY I'M SO INTERESTED AM

01:39:18.186 --> 01:39:21.055 region:rollup2
I WENT TO GO VISIT ONE OF THE

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.692 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN SAN

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:27.995 region:rollup2
DIEGO. AFTER THE OUTBREAK AND.

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:30.031 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAW AND.

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:31.766 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND WHEN I

01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:33.434 region:rollup2
CAME BACK TO FRESNO.

01:39:31.766 --> 01:39:35.770 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:37.505 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS TO GET

01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:39.006 region:rollup2
VACCINATIONS AND HELP TO

01:39:37.505 --> 01:39:40.641 region:rollup2
INCREASE AND SEE IF WE COULD GET

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.809 region:rollup2
TO HER COMMUNITY.

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:44.278 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE STRUGGLES WE FOUND IS

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:46.848 region:rollup2
AN INABILITY TO ACCESS.

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:48.082 region:rollup2
THE VACCINE BECAUSE OF THE NEED

01:39:46.848 --> 01:39:49.951 region:rollup2
TO USE IT AND SOUTHERN

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:52.420 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. SO I WANTED TO

01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:53.488 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD AND IF I CAN WHEN YOU

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.056 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE VACCINE

01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:57.925 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS.

01:39:55.056 --> 01:40:00.695 region:rollup2
HOW QUICK WAS THEIR RESPONSE TO

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:04.065 region:rollup2
WHAT LEVEL SHOULD WE BE? I'M AT

01:40:00.695 --> 01:40:04.866 region:rollup2
STRIVING TO VACCINATE HOMELESS.

01:40:04.065 --> 01:40:06.200 region:rollup2
WOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:40:04.866 --> 01:40:10.137 region:rollup2
BENEFIT

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:12.073 region:rollup2
FROM A PROGRAM TO PROACTIVELY.

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:13.908 region:rollup2
CREATE HERD IMMUNITY WITHIN OUR

01:40:12.073 --> 01:40:15.643 region:rollup2
HOMELESS POPULATION BECAUSE OF

01:40:13.908 --> 01:40:16.177 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF INCIDENCE AND RECENT

01:40:15.643 --> 01:40:17.912 region:rollup2
SPREADS THAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:21.215 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:40:17.912 --> 01:40:24.151 region:rollup2
SO GOING BACK TO THEIR EARLIER

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:25.486 region:rollup2
STAGES OF THE OUTBREAK ARE AT

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:27.054 region:rollup2
THE TIME WHEN WE HAD A DEL

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:28.756 region:rollup2
BREAKING CALIFORNIA THERE WERE

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:30.458 region:rollup2
OUTBREAKS OCCURRING IN OTHER

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:32.226 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL.

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:34.262 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE MANUFACTURE

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:36.197 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THAT WAS PRODUCING

01:40:34.262 --> 01:40:37.932 region:rollup2
HEPATITIS A VACCINE.

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:38.933 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE FACING A SITUATION

01:40:37.932 --> 01:40:41.235 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE WASN'T A NOVEL

01:40:38.933 --> 01:40:42.970 region:rollup2
SUPPLY OF HEPATITIS A VACCINE

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:44.705 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY. ARE THE FEDERAL

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:45.706 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAD A SUPPLY THAT

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:47.074 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN KILEY SHARING

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:48.543 region:rollup2
WITH US BUT THEY WERE RUNNING

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:50.011 region:rollup2
SHORT AS WELL.

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:51.812 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:53.781 region:rollup2
IN DECLARING THE YEAH EMERGENCY

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:56.684 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THEY GAVE

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:58.419 region:rollup2
US ACCESS TO BOTH ADDITIONAL

01:40:56.684 --> 01:41:00.821 region:rollup2
HARM DOSES OF VACCINE THAT WE

01:40:58.419 --> 01:41:02.990 region:rollup2
COULD PURCHASE. BUT ALSO GAVE US

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:04.358 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN TERMS OF WHERE

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:05.693 region:rollup2
VACCINE DOSES WILL BE ALLOCATED.

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:07.461 region:rollup2
THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:41:05.693 --> 01:41:09.430 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE ACTED OUTBREAKS

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:11.098 region:rollup2
ENACTED TRANSMISSION OUR MAIN

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:13.434 region:rollup2
GOAL WAS TO ACTUALLY BREAK THE

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:14.902 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION CYCLE FIRST BEFORE

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:16.804 region:rollup2
WE COULD VACCINATE ANYONE ELSE.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:17.939 region:rollup2
SO OUR DOING THAT REALLY ALLOWED

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:19.807 region:rollup2
US TO FOCUS ON THE COUNTIES

01:41:17.939 --> 01:41:20.341 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAD ACTIVE ONGOING

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.442 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION WHICH WAS SAN

01:41:20.341 --> 01:41:24.412 region:rollup2
DIEGO.

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:26.347 region:rollup2
LA SANTA CRUZ ARE PRIMARILY A TO

01:41:24.412 --> 01:41:27.782 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE BROUGHT A

01:41:26.347 --> 01:41:29.817 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION TO A TO A HALT.

01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:31.352 region:rollup2
I AND IN DOING SO YOU KNOW WE

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:32.520 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE BY COMMISSIONER THOSE

01:41:31.352 --> 01:41:34.121 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.623 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.725 region:rollup2
ALL THE HYPE IS POPULATIONS IN

01:41:35.623 --> 01:41:39.093 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND SO WE. WANTED TO

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:40.628 region:rollup2
MAKE VACCINE AVAILABLE FOR OUT

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:43.331 region:rollup2
RISK COMMUNITIES IN DOES A

01:41:40.628 --> 01:41:43.898 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IS A YOU KNOW TO THE

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:44.765 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT WE HAVE VACCINE

01:41:43.898 --> 01:41:45.600 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:47.535 region:rollup2
BOB NOW THAT.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.370 region:rollup2
THE VACCINE SUPPLIES GETTING

01:41:47.535 --> 01:41:51.372 region:rollup2
BETTER ON WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:51.872 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS HUTS WRAPPED UP

01:41:51.372 --> 01:41:54.141 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S MORE VACCINE

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:56.243 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. I THINK WE CAN SAY

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:57.712 region:rollup2
THAT I WEAR A POINT WHERE WE CAN

01:41:56.243 --> 01:42:00.281 region:rollup2
START FREEING UP MORE OF THE

01:41:57.712 --> 01:42:01.816 region:rollup2
VACCINE SUPPLY. SO THAT WE CAN I

01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:02.950 region:rollup2
GIVE IT TO OTHER POPULATIONS

01:42:01.816 --> 01:42:05.486 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:07.788 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY THE OUTBREAK. BUT

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:09.223 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AT RISK FOR HOW ABOUT

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:10.791 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SAY. I IN THIS CASE

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:11.792 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION.

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:14.628 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE HOMELESS

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:17.164 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WILL BENEFIT FROM

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:18.432 region:rollup2
CAPITALISM VACCINATION. ARE I

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:22.136 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THEY WOULD AND IT'S

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:24.338 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY. BECAUSE THE CDC

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:27.341 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS HOMELESS YET.

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:28.943 region:rollup2
RISK FACTOR FOR BUT I THINK NO

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:31.545 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED GROUPS OR

01:42:28.943 --> 01:42:32.580 region:rollup2
VACCINATION. BUTTING COLLEAGUE

01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:35.049 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE KNOW FROM

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:37.084 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT UNLESS WE CAN

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:40.321 region:rollup2
INCREASE VACCINATION RATES IN

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:40.821 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY. AYE IS GONNA BE A

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:41.489 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.156 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING WE LEARNED DURING

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:42.790 region:rollup2
THE OUTBREAK CONTROL IS THAT YOU

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.357 region:rollup2
KNOW MOST HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:43.524 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO QUALIFY FOR MEDI

01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:44.158 region:rollup2
CAL.

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:45.092 region:rollup2
SO IN WORKING WITH LOCAL HEALTH

01:42:44.158 --> 01:42:46.227 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES WE WERE ABLE TO

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:47.128 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN ROLE. MOST OF THE

01:42:46.227 --> 01:42:48.729 region:rollup2
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS CAN OPERATE

01:42:47.128 --> 01:42:50.631 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HE MADE THE COUNCIL THE

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:51.966 region:rollup2
MEDICAL WOULD REIMBURSE. FOR THE

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:53.434 region:rollup2
COST OF THE VACCINATION

01:42:51.966 --> 01:42:55.469 region:rollup2
SO THE REAL CHALLENGE IS TO

01:42:53.434 --> 01:42:57.371 region:rollup2
REACH TO THE POPULATIONS FINE

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:59.440 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. AND GET HIM TO ACCEPT

01:42:57.371 --> 01:43:00.074 region:rollup2
AND AGREE TO BE VACCINATED BUT I

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.975 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:02.610 region:rollup2
TO THOUGH IT.

01:43:00.975 --> 01:43:03.544 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF NUMBER

01:43:02.610 --> 01:43:05.746 region:rollup2
OF.

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:07.481 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:10.117 region:rollup2
HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WOULD

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:11.752 region:rollup2
NEED THE VACCINATION AND THE A

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:14.121 region:rollup2
COST BOTH TO.

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:16.357 region:rollup2
HELP WITH THE START UP BUT ALSO

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:17.825 region:rollup2
ANY. PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:19.860 region:rollup2
COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL. IS

01:43:17.825 --> 01:43:22.630 region:rollup2
THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR US TO

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.799 region:rollup2
WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO.

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:25.366 region:rollup2
TRY TO COME UP WITH A FIGURE IN

01:43:24.799 --> 01:43:27.468 region:rollup2
LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST

01:43:25.366 --> 01:43:29.236 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:43:27.468 --> 01:43:31.205 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:32.173 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF.

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:33.974 region:rollup2
THE BALL GOING FORWARD IS A

01:43:32.173 --> 01:43:35.076 region:rollup2
STATE AND WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:36.777 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:43:35.076 --> 01:43:38.546 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS.

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:40.047 region:rollup2
YEAH ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:42.049 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:43.250 region:rollup2
HAS PROVEN VERY VERY CHALLENGING

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.618 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD THE

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:46.587 region:rollup2
SAME QUESTION AND WE WANTED TO

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:47.488 region:rollup2
KNOW EVEN WITHIN THAT COUNTY

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.689 region:rollup2
LIKE SAN DIEGO.

01:43:47.488 --> 01:43:50.424 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAD?

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:51.625 region:rollup2
ACTIVE OUTBREAK THERE WERE NOT

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.893 region:rollup2
REALLY VERY GOOD ESTIMATES OF

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:53.994 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WHERE

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:55.896 region:rollup2
HOMELESS.

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:58.399 region:rollup2
SO SAN DIEGO COUNTY ACTUALLY HAD

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:59.533 region:rollup2
TO DO VERY ACTIVE.

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:00.334 region:rollup2
COUNTING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:02.069 region:rollup2
HOMELESS TO GET A BETTER

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.537 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO DO

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:05.106 region:rollup2
THAT ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:06.740 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT A VERY GOOD PLACE

01:44:05.106 --> 01:44:07.908 region:rollup2
WHERE ONE CAN GO. BY AND SEE HOW

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:09.009 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE HOMELESS

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:10.444 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:11.979 region:rollup2
THE HAVING SAID THAT I THINK

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:12.913 region:rollup2
THAT IN MANY INSTANCES LOCAL

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:14.915 region:rollup2
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:16.450 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TRY TO QUANTIFY IN

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:18.519 region:rollup2
THERE ON JURISDICTIONS. YOU KNOW

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:20.454 region:rollup2
WHO IS HOMELESS ARE AND THEY

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:21.388 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF HELPING

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:21.856 region:rollup2
TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINE THE

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:22.757 region:rollup2
VACCINE WAS TO BE MADE

01:44:21.856 --> 01:44:24.658 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:44:22.757 --> 01:44:26.427 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:28.596 region:rollup2
BOB WITH THAT IF I CAN WILL MOVE

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:30.765 region:rollup2
ON TO THE STD QUESTIONS AND THEN

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:31.766 region:rollup2
WILL INVOLVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:33.000 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'LL

01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:34.401 region:rollup2
HAVE TO THINK IT.

TOPIC OF GREAT FOCUS FOR ME AND

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:43.077 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE INCREASE IN SEXUALLY

01:44:41.976 --> 01:44:44.345 region:rollup2
TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN

01:44:43.077 --> 01:44:45.646 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:44:44.345 --> 01:44:47.047 region:rollup2

CONTINUED INCREASE IN EACH OF

01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:13.374 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:45:11.739 --> 01:45:14.675 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:45:13.374 --> 01:45:16.310 region:rollup2
THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND

EARLY SURPLUSES AS YOU KNOW THE

01:45:26.854 --> 01:45:29.456 region:rollup2
INFECTIOUS STAGE OF SYPHILIS AND

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.458 region:rollup2
MOST DIRECTLY.

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:33.160 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THE ONGOING SYPHILIS

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:34.929 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION IN COMMUNITIES.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.330 region:rollup2

INCREASED FOURFOLD SINCE TWENTY

YOU KNOW THAT'S AN EXCELLENT

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:45.198 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND GOES BACK TO THE

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:46.399 region:rollup2
VERY SAME ISSUE OF LOCAL

02:01:45.198 --> 02:01:47.934 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:49.702 region:rollup2
HIGH YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL HEALTH

OFFICERS AND WE MEET WITH THEM

02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:52.839 region:rollup2
REGULARLY KNOW THAT THAT THAT

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:54.841 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH GILES REALLY WORKS

02:01:52.839 --> 02:01:56.276 region:rollup2
AND THEY WANT TO DO THIS ON IT

02:01:54.841 --> 02:01:57.677 region:rollup2
IS AN ISSUE OF THIS THEM NOT

02:01:56.276 --> 02:01:59.913 region:rollup2
HAVING ENOUGH CAPACITY AND THE

02:01:57.677 --> 02:02:01.681 region:rollup2

DONE IT TOUGH ON THE TO BE VERY

02:02:04.951 --> 02:02:08.288 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE? SO IS ONE OF THOSE

02:02:06.753 --> 02:02:10.223 region:rollup2
SORT OF LONG HANGING FRUITS THAT

02:02:08.288 --> 02:02:10.824 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SOME RESOURCES AT THE

02:02:10.223 --> 02:02:13.293 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL COULD MAKE A BIG

02:02:10.824 --> 02:02:15.628 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE. AND IT'S NOT LOST ON

02:02:13.293 --> 02:02:18.064 region:rollup2
ME THAT THE ONE TIME FUNDING DID

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:20.266 region:rollup2
NOT CREATE THE ABILITY TO.

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:22.669 region:rollup2
CREATE THOSE PERMANENT POSITIONS

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:24.237 region:rollup2
AND LATER IN THIS AGENDAWE WILL

02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:26.439 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM ONGOING.

02:02:24.237 --> 02:02:28.608 region:rollup2

SIX MILLION DOLLARS A

02:06:50.937 --> 02:06:54.173 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION BUDGET.

02:06:52.038 --> 02:06:55.308 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:57.176 region:rollup2
SO WE HAD THE JUST REVIEW THE

02:06:55.308 --> 02:06:58.744 region:rollup2
PROJECTS ESTIMATE AND THE BITS

02:06:57.176 --> 02:07:00.046 region:rollup2
THAT WERE RECEIVED. AND

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:02.381 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THAT THAT ONE BECAUSE

02:07:00.046 --> 02:07:04.083 region:rollup2
IT'S A SPECIALTY TYPE OF SERVICE

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:05.351 region:rollup2
SOUGHT AT THE LABORATORIES NOT

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:07.186 region:rollup2
JUST STOP BUILDING CONSTRUCTION

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:08.588 region:rollup2
NOW ELIMINATE THE COP THE

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:10.423 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE CLOCK CONSTRUCTION

02:07:08.588 --> 02:07:10.890 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS THAT COULD. FIT ON

02:07:10.423 --> 02:07:12.825 region:rollup2
THIS

02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:13.392 region:rollup2
THE SECOND WAS IF YOU LOOK AT

02:07:12.825 --> 02:07:14.994 region:rollup2
THE.

02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:16.629 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION MARKET RIGHT NOW

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:18.598 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY VERY HEALTHY.

02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:21.767 region:rollup2
OF THEM IT'S VERY VERY STRONG IN

02:07:18.598 --> 02:07:22.735 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA. AND US ALL THAT

02:07:21.767 --> 02:07:24.804 region:rollup2
LIMITED THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO

02:07:22.735 --> 02:07:26.405 region:rollup2
ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING SOME

02:07:24.804 --> 02:07:28.574 region:rollup2
FUND A PROJECT LIKE THIS.

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:29.976 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT ALSO THE PROJECT

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:32.512 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL ESTIMATE THAT

02:07:29.976 --> 02:07:33.846 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GIVE A CALL REFLECT

02:07:32.512 --> 02:07:35.248 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT STRENGTH UP THE UC

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:37.250 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION MARKET THEY USED A

02:07:35.248 --> 02:07:38.918 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT OF. THE COST

02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:40.086 region:rollup2
INCREASE FACTOR AND IT'S GOT IN

02:07:38.918 --> 02:07:40.586 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION MARK WAS

02:07:40.086 --> 02:07:42.421 region:rollup2
GROWING AT TEN TO TWELVE

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:44.257 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:45.725 region:rollup2
SO THEN HE JUST LOOK AT THE BETS

02:07:44.257 --> 02:07:47.660 region:rollup2
AND ARE LOOKED AT THE ONE BIT

02:07:45.725 --> 02:07:50.396 region:rollup2
AND DETERMINED BASED ON WHAT

02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:51.931 region:rollup2
THEY SAW THAT IT IT. ADDED ACT

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:53.132 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY REFLECTED BEYOND THE

02:07:51.931 --> 02:07:55.201 region:rollup2
CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE

CONSTRUCTION MARKET.

02:07:55.201 --> 02:07:58.804 region:rollup2
SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN.

02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:59.805 region:rollup2

ESTIMATE WHICH WERE ACTUALLY

02:08:01.274 --> 02:08:04.343 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THE UP CURRENT STRENGTH

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:06.145 region:rollup2
OF THE. OTHER CONSTRUCTION

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:07.680 region:rollup2
MARKET AND THE SPECIALTY NATURE

02:08:06.145 --> 02:08:09.515 region:rollup2
OF THE UP PROJECT.

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:11.317 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT REVISED SCHEDULE IS

02:09:40.406 --> 02:09:43.909 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. I THINK OF THE

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:45.945 region:rollup2
THE TENOR OF THE CONVERSATION IS

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:46.946 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN WE

02:09:45.945 --> 02:09:48.614 region:rollup2
WERE BEFORE YOU A YEAR AGO.

02:09:46.946 --> 02:09:50.516 region:rollup2
WHICH I I FEEL LIKE YOU YOU HAD

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:51.951 region:rollup2
TO TO PULL MORE INFORMATION OUT

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:53.719 region:rollup2
OF THE DEPARTMENT THIS TIME THEY

02:09:51.951 --> 02:09:55.254 region:rollup2
WERE MUCH MORE WILLING TO. TO

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:56.322 region:rollup2
PRESENT I THINK IT CHANGES ARE

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:57.790 region:rollup2
CHANGES THE TENOR OF THIS

02:09:56.322 --> 02:09:59.825 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WANT TO ADD.

02:09:57.790 --> 02:10:01.694 region:rollup2
ONE THING IN TERMS A CONTEXT

02:09:59.825 --> 02:10:03.596 region:rollup2
LIKE. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED

02:10:01.694 --> 02:10:05.131 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE

02:10:03.596 --> 02:10:06.032 region:rollup2
BEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

02:10:05.131 --> 02:10:06.999 region:rollup2
LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT WHAT'S

02:10:06.032 --> 02:10:08.467 region:rollup2
HAPPENING CALIFORNIA THE LAST

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.935 region:rollup2
HUNDRED YEARS

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:11.270 region:rollup2
THIS IS WE ARE ANOTHER CYCLE

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:12.872 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE SIXTIES

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:13.973 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTIES AND THOSE OF US

02:10:12.872 --> 02:10:14.940 region:rollup2
WHO GREW UP IN THE SIXTIES AND

02:10:13.973 --> 02:10:17.310 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:19.378 region:rollup2
LIKE. AND HOW STD RATES WERE

02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:21.247 region:rollup2
OUTRAGEOUSLY.

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:21.647 region:rollup2
I WASN'T ASKING FOR YOU TO HOOK

02:10:21.247 --> 02:10:22.715 region:rollup2
TO APPLY MISTER.

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:24.517 region:rollup2
.

02:10:22.715 --> 02:10:26.218 region:rollup2
A.

02:10:24.517 --> 02:10:28.587 region:rollup2
SO IN THE IN NINETEEN SIXTY WE

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:30.056 region:rollup2
SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF A RISE

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:31.557 region:rollup2
ON AN STD RATES LOOKING AT

02:10:30.056 --> 02:10:32.091 region:rollup2
GONORRHEA AND PARTICULAR BECAUSE

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.192 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN

02:10:32.091 --> 02:10:34.994 region:rollup2
TRACKED OVER.

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:36.929 region:rollup2
THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS I'M TO

02:10:34.994 --> 02:10:38.464 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE WE GOT TO.

02:10:36.929 --> 02:10:39.999 region:rollup2
A RATE THAT IS WAS SO

02:10:38.464 --> 02:10:41.500 region:rollup2
OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH IN SEVENTY

02:10:39.999 --> 02:10:44.470 region:rollup2
NINE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:45.004 region:rollup2
FIVE CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND.

02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:45.971 region:rollup2
ON THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY

02:10:45.004 --> 02:10:47.673 region:rollup2
STEPPED UP.

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:49.842 region:rollup2
AND STARTED DOING THINGS TO

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:51.677 region:rollup2
BRING VALUE THE STD EPIDEMIC AT

02:10:49.842 --> 02:10:52.778 region:rollup2
THAT POINT UNDER CONTROL TO THE

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:54.413 region:rollup2
POINT THE BY THE TIME WE GOT TO

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:56.115 region:rollup2
THEM THAT NINETIES LATE NINETIES

02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:57.717 region:rollup2
WE WERE SEEING NUMBERS BACK TO

02:10:56.115 --> 02:10:59.351 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WERE IN THE FIFTIES.

02:10:57.717 --> 02:11:01.220 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT BECAUSE WHAT THE

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:02.688 region:rollup2
STATE WAS DOING ON SOME OF IT

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:04.156 region:rollup2
ALSO BECAUSE OF CULTURAL ISSUES

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:05.491 region:rollup2
ON THE HIV EPIDEMIC.

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:06.625 region:rollup2
HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THAT

02:11:05.491 --> 02:11:06.826 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:08.260 region:rollup2
THEIR.

02:11:06.826 --> 02:11:10.463 region:rollup2
THEIR PRACTICES

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:11.030 region:rollup2
I'M BUT STILL WE MADE AN EFFORT

02:11:10.463 --> 02:11:12.098 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE ABLE TO PICK IT

02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:13.766 region:rollup2
UNDER CONTROL.

02:11:12.098 --> 02:11:15.267 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TEN YEARS

02:11:13.766 --> 02:11:18.304 region:rollup2
OR SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT.

02:11:15.267 --> 02:11:20.239 region:rollup2
THAT CLIMB BEGIN AGAIN ON WE

02:11:18.304 --> 02:11:22.875 region:rollup2
STARTED LOW AND WE'RE NOW BACK

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:24.310 region:rollup2
UP INTO INTO THREE DIGIT NUMBERS

02:11:22.875 --> 02:11:26.345 region:rollup2
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND WITCHES.

02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:27.646 region:rollup2
AND AND CONTINUING TO GO OUT TO

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:29.382 region:rollup2
GO OFTEN AND WE NEED TO DO

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:31.450 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I'M DRAMATIC TO CHANGE

02:11:29.382 --> 02:11:32.618 region:rollup2
IT. WE APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:38.491 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY TAKING A LEADERSHIP

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:39.391 region:rollup2
ROLE BUT ALSO BY PUTTING FIVE

02:11:38.491 --> 02:11:40.960 region:rollup2
MILLION AND LAST YEAR

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:44.196 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE DIDN'T SURVIVE. BUT

02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.830 region:rollup2
YOU WILL GET YOU UNDERSTAND AS

02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:46.565 region:rollup2
DOCTOR CHAVEZ SAID AND DOCTOR

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:48.200 region:rollup2
SMITH SAID EVEN TODAY THAT THE

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:49.468 region:rollup2
ISSUE WAS MANPOWER'S BITS PEOPLE

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.936 region:rollup2
POWER WE NEED PEOPLE ON THE

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:52.571 region:rollup2
GROUND WHETHER THEY WORK FOR

02:11:50.936 --> 02:11:54.273 region:rollup2
COUNTIES OR CBO'S. I'M TO

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:55.741 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO THE WORK ON TO MAKE

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:57.843 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THESE THINGS THAT

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:59.678 region:rollup2
THINGS STICK. ON THAT WE'RE NOT

02:11:57.843 --> 02:12:01.614 region:rollup2
THROWING KITS AT THEM WHICH

02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:03.115 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THEY NEED THOSE KITS.

02:12:01.614 --> 02:12:04.350 region:rollup2
FOR FOR TESTING PURPOSES BUT

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:05.918 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T STOP WITH THE TEST AND

02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:07.219 region:rollup2
NOT DO THE NEXT THINGS WHICH IS

02:12:05.918 --> 02:12:08.621 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:10.256 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT THEIR PARTNERS

02:12:08.621 --> 02:12:11.290 region:rollup2
GET NOTIFIED THAT THEIR PARTNERS

02:12:10.256 --> 02:12:13.659 region:rollup2
GET TREATMENT.

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:16.195 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY NEED IT AMEND SO WE

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:18.664 region:rollup2
DO REALLY INTERRUPT ON INTERRUPT

02:12:16.195 --> 02:12:20.032 region:rollup2
THE CYCLE AYE SO WE WOULD LAWYER

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:20.833 region:rollup2
I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:22.568 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:23.903 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR WE'RE

02:12:22.568 --> 02:12:26.639 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR TEN MILLION THIS YEAR

02:12:23.903 --> 02:12:28.107 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE GETS WORSE AND WORSE

02:12:26.639 --> 02:12:30.142 region:rollup2
URINE AND YOU'RE OUT?

02:12:28.107 --> 02:12:31.977 region:rollup2
AND WE REALLY NEED TO PUT A

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:34.680 region:rollup2
SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY AT IT

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:37.683 region:rollup2
ON TEN MILLION IS A SMALL AMOUNT

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.718 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A A A BIG

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:41.921 region:rollup2
START. GOING TO CLOSE WITH ONE

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:43.589 region:rollup2
LAST POINT THAT THAT WE

02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:46.158 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES LOSE SIGHT OF THAT WE

02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:47.860 region:rollup2
LOOK AT ALL THE DATA. ON AND

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:52.998 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT MEDICALLY

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:53.666 region:rollup2
CLINICALLY ON STDS ARE CHANGING.

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:55.634 region:rollup2
ENDS I GONORRHEA ESPECIALLY HAS

02:12:53.666 --> 02:12:56.936 region:rollup2
GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:57.636 region:rollup2
DOWN TO ACCORDING THE CDC ONE.

02:12:56.936 --> 02:12:59.104 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT WORKS FOR

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.972 region:rollup2
GONORRHEA EVERYTHING ELSE WE ARE

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:00.606 region:rollup2
ARE SEEING DRUG RESISTANT.

02:12:59.972 --> 02:13:01.774 region:rollup2
STRAINS OF GONORRHEA THAT ARE

02:13:00.606 --> 02:13:02.908 region:rollup2
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE ARE NEARLY

02:13:01.774 --> 02:13:03.876 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO US.

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:04.476 region:rollup2
TO TREAT MOM SO WHERE WE'RE

02:13:03.876 --> 02:13:04.877 region:rollup2
CREATING A SITUATION WHERE THE

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:05.511 region:rollup2
NUMBERS GO UP.

02:13:04.877 --> 02:13:06.445 region:rollup2
IN A DISEASE THAT IS BECOMING

02:13:05.511 --> 02:13:07.847 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY UNTREATABLE WHICH

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:09.114 region:rollup2
IF WE GET OVER THAT UNFORTUNATE

02:13:07.847 --> 02:13:10.082 region:rollup2

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:58.376 region:rollup2
DATA LOOKING AT PREP UPTAKE IN

THE STATE'S MEDI CAL PROGRAM.

02:31:58.376 --> 02:32:01.045 region:rollup2

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:03.147 region:rollup2
TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT

02:32:01.045 --> 02:32:03.748 region:rollup2

02:32:19.297 --> 02:32:23.601 region:rollup2

02:32:25.036 --> 02:32:28.673 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW

02:32:26.838 --> 02:32:30.575 region:rollup2
HIV DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

02:32:28.673 --> 02:32:32.510 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS OF HIV RATE AMONG

02:32:30.575 --> 02:32:34.712 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS IS FOUR TIMES

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:36.514 region:rollup2
THAT OF WHITES AND AMONG LATINOS

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:38.416 region:rollup2
IS ONE HALF TIMES THAT OF WHITES

02:32:36.514 --> 02:32:39.951 region:rollup2
AND SO. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

02:32:38.416 --> 02:32:41.252 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE MAKE ADDITIONAL

02:32:39.951 --> 02:32:42.654 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT THOSE

02:32:41.252 --> 02:32:43.755 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES ARE ONLY GOING TO BE

02:32:42.654 --> 02:32:46.257 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED.

02:32:43.755 --> 02:32:47.658 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL AS TEN

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:50.094 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND.

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:52.230 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:54.565 region:rollup2
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CBO'S TO

02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:57.368 region:rollup2
PROVIDE HIV PREVENTION SERVICES

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:58.970 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PREP AND HIV TESTING.

02:32:57.368 --> 02:33:01.072 region:rollup2
I THINK SIGNIFICANTLY WE DON'T

02:32:58.970 --> 02:33:02.206 region:rollup2
HAVE A RELIABLE ADEQUATE FUNDING

02:33:01.072 --> 02:33:03.808 region:rollup2
SOURCE

02:33:02.206 --> 02:33:05.977 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR PREP PROGRAM SO

02:33:03.808 --> 02:33:06.811 region:rollup2
THE CDC. HAS BEEN FUNDING

02:33:05.977 --> 02:33:08.446 region:rollup2
SEVERAL LOCAL HEALTH

02:33:06.811 --> 02:33:10.581 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS FOR THE PAST THREE

02:33:08.446 --> 02:33:12.450 region:rollup2
YEARS AT ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT

02:33:10.581 --> 02:33:14.052 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT

02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:15.053 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS SET TO EXPIRE THIS

02:33:14.052 --> 02:33:16.688 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:33:15.053 --> 02:33:18.022 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE FOR

02:33:16.688 --> 02:33:19.590 region:rollup2
THE INVESTMENT UP TO MILLION

02:33:18.022 --> 02:33:21.592 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN PREP NAVIGATION THAT

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:23.294 region:rollup2
WAS MADE A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:24.729 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE WERE SEEN AS THAT'S

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:26.698 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH TO MEET STATEWIDE

02:33:24.729 --> 02:33:28.132 region:rollup2
DEMAND WHEN THOSE ARE OF PEAS

02:33:26.698 --> 02:33:29.767 region:rollup2
WHEN OUT THEY RECEIVED EIGHTEEN

02:33:28.132 --> 02:33:31.269 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:33.471 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED WE KNOW THE NEED.

02:33:31.269 --> 02:33:34.839 region:rollup2
AS MUCH GREATER THAT'S CURRENTLY

02:33:33.471 --> 02:33:36.974 region:rollup2
BEING ALLOCATED.

02:33:34.839 --> 02:33:38.609 region:rollup2
I AM THE NEXT PROPOSALS AROUND

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:40.478 region:rollup2
EDUCATING MEDICAL PROVIDERS

02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:42.146 region:rollup2
ABOUT ADVANCES IN HIV AND STI

02:33:40.478 --> 02:33:43.681 region:rollup2
PREVENTION. I KNOW THIS IS

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.016 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR SMITH AND

02:33:43.681 --> 02:33:47.218 region:rollup2
OTHERS MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE

02:33:45.016 --> 02:33:49.187 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF. PROVIDERS AND

02:33:47.218 --> 02:33:50.822 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO INTERVENE AND

02:33:49.187 --> 02:33:53.357 region:rollup2
PREVENT ACQUISITION OR TREATMENT

02:33:50.822 --> 02:33:54.525 region:rollup2
OF HIV AND OTHER STIS. SO WE'VE

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:56.027 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT'S AFFECTED IN OTHER

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:57.395 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY DO

02:33:56.027 --> 02:33:58.963 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH DETAILING AN

02:33:57.395 --> 02:34:02.900 region:rollup2
EXPERT GOES AROUND AND MEETS

02:33:58.963 --> 02:34:02.900 region:rollup2
WITH PROVIDERS ONE ON ONE.

02:34:02.967 --> 02:34:06.404 region:rollup2
DETAILING INITIATIVE WAS SHOWN

02:34:03.735 --> 02:34:07.505 region:rollup2
TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE FIRST

02:34:06.404 --> 02:34:09.507 region:rollup2
TIME PRESCRIBING A PROP.

02:34:07.505 --> 02:34:11.275 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO EXPAND

02:34:09.507 --> 02:34:13.544 region:rollup2
AND REPLICATE THOSE EFFORTS

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:15.947 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD WE CONTINUE TO HEAR

02:34:13.544 --> 02:34:17.915 region:rollup2
FROM PATIENTS ACROSS THE STATE.

02:34:15.947 --> 02:34:19.217 region:rollup2
IN PLACES LIKE FRESNO ANOTHER

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:20.952 region:rollup2
WORLD JURISDICTIONS.

02:34:19.217 --> 02:34:22.320 region:rollup2
WHERE PROVIDERS EITHER DON'T

02:34:20.952 --> 02:34:24.622 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT PERHAPS OR ARE

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:25.389 region:rollup2
UNWILLING TO PRESCRIBE AND SO WE

02:34:24.622 --> 02:34:27.091 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT SAYS NO EFFECTIVE

02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:28.726 region:rollup2
WAY? TO INCREASE AT A

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:30.094 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION.

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:30.962 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE FINAL THAT I'M

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:32.630 region:rollup2
GONNA PRESENTED JUST SOME

02:34:30.962 --> 02:34:34.465 region:rollup2
MODIFICATIONS TO THE STATE'S

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:36.367 region:rollup2
PURPOSES AND PROGRAM.

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:38.002 region:rollup2
THIS IT HAS WAS APPROVED

02:34:36.367 --> 02:34:39.070 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:40.872 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR.

02:34:39.070 --> 02:34:42.740 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS GONNA HELP

02:34:40.872 --> 02:34:44.642 region:rollup2
IMPROVE ACCESS TO PREP FOR LOW

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:45.143 region:rollup2
INCOME FOLKS. AND WE'RE VERY

02:34:44.642 --> 02:34:46.144 region:rollup2
PLEASED TO SEE IT MOVING

02:34:45.143 --> 02:34:48.713 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:34:46.144 --> 02:34:50.214 region:rollup2
WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW GAPS IN

02:34:48.713 --> 02:34:52.650 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM THAT REALLY PREVENT

02:34:50.214 --> 02:34:54.819 region:rollup2
IT FROM PROVIDING FULL SAFETY

02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:55.953 region:rollup2
NET COVERAGE FOR A UNINSURED AND

02:34:54.819 --> 02:34:57.255 region:rollup2
UNDERINSURED FOLKS AND SO WE

02:34:55.953 --> 02:34:58.556 region:rollup2
PROPOSED.

02:34:57.255 --> 02:35:00.858 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THAT

02:34:58.556 --> 02:35:02.193 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF

02:35:00.858 --> 02:35:04.028 region:rollup2
THEM NOW BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:35:02.193 --> 02:35:05.663 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

WANT TO TRACK THAT WE JUST

02:35:09.867 --> 02:35:14.105 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED PROP.

02:35:11.302 --> 02:35:15.673 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL ONE FOUR AND FIVE A

02:35:14.105 --> 02:35:17.175 region:rollup2
BELIEVE NOW THERE COLLEGES GO

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:20.244 region:rollup2
OUT OF ORDER.

02:35:17.175 --> 02:35:20.711 region:rollup2
OKAY BETRAYED THAT I THINK THAT

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:22.747 region:rollup2
HOW BAY THAT THE US.

02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:23.881 region:rollup2
AND SO YES I AM AGAIN COURTNEY

02:35:22.747 --> 02:35:25.550 region:rollup2
FROM THE SENSE GOOD ITS

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:27.051 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION I WANTED TO SPEAK TO

02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:28.653 region:rollup2
TO PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE MAKING

02:35:27.051 --> 02:35:29.921 region:rollup2
FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT

02:35:28.653 --> 02:35:32.757 region:rollup2
AIM TO.

02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:34.091 region:rollup2
IMPROVE SERVICES AT FOUR TWO

02:35:32.757 --> 02:35:35.426 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE

02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:36.894 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS BOTH OF THESE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:39.096 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ARE GROWING OUT OF

02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:40.565 region:rollup2
EXISTING. AND AND SUCCESSFUL

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:42.333 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT WE LIKE TO SEE

02:35:40.565 --> 02:35:43.334 region:rollup2
REPLICATED IN OTHER AREAS ACROSS

02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:44.869 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

02:35:43.334 --> 02:35:47.872 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST IS TWO MILLION

02:35:44.869 --> 02:35:49.140 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR

02:35:47.872 --> 02:35:50.975 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR DEMO PROJECTS.

02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:52.710 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE LINKAGE AT TATE AB

02:35:50.975 --> 02:35:54.011 region:rollup2
CARE AND PREVENTION SERVICES AS

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:55.413 region:rollup2
WELL AS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:56.881 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FAR TRANSGENDER

02:35:55.413 --> 02:35:57.949 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

02:35:56.881 --> 02:35:59.717 region:rollup2
JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

02:35:57.949 --> 02:36:02.053 region:rollup2
STATISTICS A ONE THIRD OF

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:04.255 region:rollup2
TRANSGENDER POPULATION AS I HIV

02:36:02.053 --> 02:36:05.623 region:rollup2

SHOWED THAT TRANSGENDER WOMEN

02:36:05.623 --> 02:36:08.726 region:rollup2
ARE AS MUCH AS FORTY NINE

02:36:06.891 --> 02:36:10.228 region:rollup2
PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO BE HIV

02:36:08.726 --> 02:36:11.195 region:rollup2
POSITIVE THAN THE GENERAL

02:36:10.228 --> 02:36:12.964 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

02:36:11.195 --> 02:36:14.632 region:rollup2
I'M IN ADDITION TRANSGENDER

THEY CALIFORNIA HIV RESEARCH

02:36:22.707 --> 02:36:27.178 region:rollup2
PROJECT HOSTED I THINK.

02:36:24.709 --> 02:36:28.346 region:rollup2
THINK TANK WITH I'M TRANSGENDER

02:36:27.178 --> 02:36:31.449 region:rollup2

ECONOMIC AND ISSUES AND

02:36:33.017 --> 02:36:36.454 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:38.456 region:rollup2
AS THE MAIN BARRIER TO ACCESSING

02:36:36.454 --> 02:36:39.857 region:rollup2
HIV KAREN PREVENTION FOR THE

02:36:38.456 --> 02:36:41.525 region:rollup2

ARM DISCRIMINATION AT WORK.

02:36:46.898 --> 02:36:50.067 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:51.535 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:53.137 region:rollup2
WOULD SEEK TO BOTH INCREASE.

02:36:51.535 --> 02:36:54.772 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVE LINKAGE TO

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:56.407 region:rollup2

ENVIRONMENT AND UPLOAD STATE

02:37:02.113 --> 02:37:05.583 region:rollup2
NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS? AND

02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:06.751 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS WIT WE BELIEVE

02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:08.686 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS ARE IMPORTANT AND

.

02:37:10.388 --> 02:37:14.058 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS IMPROVED

02:37:11.622 --> 02:37:15.259 region:rollup2
HIV PREVENTION CARE SERVICES. AS

STRUCTURAL BARRIER THAT WILL

02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:19.196 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR

DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PROPOSAL

02:37:25.102 --> 02:37:28.806 region:rollup2
IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE

02:37:27.238 --> 02:37:30.174 region:rollup2
TIME FUNDING THAT WOULD SUPPORT.

02:37:28.806 --> 02:37:31.876 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION

02:37:30.174 --> 02:37:32.943 region:rollup2

SEEING THIS AND TRY AND SOONER.

02:37:55.166 --> 02:37:58.402 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH HIV

02:37:56.734 --> 02:38:00.304 region:rollup2
FACE UNIQUE CLINIC ON PSYCHO

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:02.807 region:rollup2
SOCIAL ISSUES AS THEY AGE SO HIV
