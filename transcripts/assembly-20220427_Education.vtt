00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.657
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT

FOCUSES FIRST ON LEASES AND

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:16.300
THEN. OTHER COSTS AND SO THOSE

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.501
ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE.

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.869

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:29.519
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE TOO

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:30.887
MANY STUDENTS ARE LEFT BEHIND

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:34.157
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THIS ELSE IF

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.059
THAT POLICY- ALIVE THE DISTRICTS

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:37.861
WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:40.296

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:41.297
BEHIND STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.699

PARTICULAR HOUSE SAID WE DON'T

THINK CHANGING THE DATE. GORIES

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:04.154

REALLY THE INCREASES NORTH OF

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.670

FACING OUR EMPLOYEES OUR

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.641

ANALYSIS FROM THIS COMMITTEE

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.459
THIS ACADEMIC GAP HAS BEEN

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.761
PRESENT FOR DECADES. THE MOST

RECENT DATA BY THE CALIFORNIA

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHOWS

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:27.969
THAT IN 201967% OF AFRICAN

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:30.538

BELOW GRADE LEVEL IN MATH. JUST

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.513
LET THOSE NUMBERS SINK IN. THIS

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.749
MEANS THAT ONLY 33% OF AFRICAN

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.117
AMERICAN STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.052

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.193
PERCENT PROFICIENT IN MATH. THAT

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.260
MEANS WE ARE KILLING THESE

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:57.999
CHILDREN. 33% AND 21% ON ANY

01:33:58.065 --> 01:34:00.801
EXAM IS AN AFT. THIS IS AN ODD

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.269
THING THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:04.672
ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:05.706

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.955

WE PUT THE ALLOCATION IN THE

02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:55.859
BUDGET. THERE WAS A ONE TIME

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:59.563
ALLOCATION AND- IT'S SOMEWHAT

02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:01.732

02:39:13.677 --> 02:39:15.679
LEAP OF FAITH WE HOPE THAT

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:17.447

02:39:44.708 --> 02:39:45.909
OF THE ISSUES WITH THAT IS. THE

02:39:45.976 --> 02:39:47.811

LOOKING VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:01.525
SURE THAT- THE FUNDS ARE NOT

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:02.559
ONLY GOING WHERE THEY'RE

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:05.028
SUPPOSED TO BE GOING AND DOING

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:05.595
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.364

OUR SUPERINTENDENT AS A- PARTNER

PUT THIS IN THE BUDGET FOR YEARS

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:21.545

THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE

02:54:43.973 --> 02:54:46.275
THAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT- SO. BASIS

THAT'S- THAT'S ALLOWED THAT'S

02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:34.056
HEARING THAT THAT'S DONE. WHAT

02:55:34.123 --> 02:55:36.292
THIS IS ABOUT IS ALLOWING

DO OUTREACH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:55.344

IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION TO BE

02:57:15.057 --> 02:57:16.292
SHARED WITH THE IMMUNIZATION

02:57:16.359 --> 02:57:18.861
REGISTRY AS LONG AS THE PATIENT

RECORDS SO THAT IT IS NOT SHARED

02:57:26.769 --> 02:57:29.138
WITH ANY OTHER USER SO THAT THE

02:57:29.205 --> 02:57:31.207
SCHOOL SYSTEM CAN'T SEE IT ON

02:57:31.273 --> 02:57:33.843

SHOULDN'T YOU WILL BE FLAGGED.

02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:12.948
ON ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE HAD

02:58:13.015 --> 02:58:14.116
YESTERDAY WAS WHETHER OR NOT

02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:15.785
THERE HAS BEEN LIKE ANY BREACHES

02:58:15.851 --> 02:58:17.286
AND THE AND THE IMMUNIZATION

02:58:17.353 --> 02:58:19.688
REGISTRIES SINCE IT'S BEEN IN

02:58:19.755 --> 02:58:21.090
EXISTENCE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS.

02:58:21.157 --> 02:58:23.859
NOW SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

02:58:23.926 --> 02:58:25.661
BEEN THERE IT'S SAFE IT DOES NOT

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:28.097
VIOLATE HIPPA LAWS- IF THE ONLY

02:58:28.164 --> 02:58:29.932
THING IS THAT NOT ALL PROVIDERS

02:58:29.999 --> 02:58:31.567
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN A SMALL

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:33.035
PRIVATE PRACTICE SOMEWHERE YOU

02:58:33.102 --> 02:58:34.737
MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE INPUTTING

02:58:34.804 --> 02:58:36.872
THAT INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM

02:58:36.939 --> 02:58:39.775
BUT IT'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE

02:58:39.842 --> 02:58:40.676
REALLY SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY

02:58:40.743 --> 02:58:41.544
HAVE TO CARRY AROUND DIGITAL

02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:42.878
CARDS THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE

02:58:42.945 --> 02:58:45.915
WHEN I WAS A AND- BECAUSE WE

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:49.552
HAVE PASSED IT BOB THEY'RE NOT.

02:58:49.618 --> 02:58:50.886
OTHER METAL PRACTICES AND WE

02:58:50.953 --> 02:58:53.022
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:58:53.089 --> 02:58:54.690
IMMUNIZATION DATABASE IS. MODERN

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:56.859

ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M I

02:59:05.101 --> 02:59:06.469
THINK THERE IS A DISCONNECT

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:09.071
BETWEEN WHAT THE SUPPORT SIDE IS

02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:11.140
AYING WHAT THE BILL DOES AND

02:59:11.207 --> 02:59:12.741
WHAT ARE WHAT SOME PEOPLE'S

02:59:12.808 --> 02:59:14.510
UNDERSTANDING IS AND I THINK THE

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:16.445
DISCONNECT THERE IS THERE A

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:18.814
CONVERSATION BY THE SUPPORT SIDE

02:59:18.881 --> 02:59:19.949
THE THAT A DISTRICT. SORT OF

02:59:20.015 --> 02:59:22.218
DOWNLOAD OR ACCESS YOU KNOW

02:59:22.284 --> 02:59:24.820
THERE DISTRICTS DATA SO OUR

02:59:24.887 --> 02:59:28.090
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CURRENTLY

02:59:28.157 --> 02:59:31.927
ALL THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE CARE

DOWN. THERE SAYING THAT IT'S

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:39.902
GOING TO BE A THAT THEY WANT TO

02:59:42.738 --> 02:59:44.306
OF THE BILL FROM THIS PREMISE

02:59:44.373 --> 02:59:46.876
COMMITTEE ONLY WOULD RESTRICT IT

02:59:46.942 --> 02:59:50.079
TO COVE IT BUT I THINK THERE IS

02:59:50.146 --> 02:59:52.248
A CONNECT ON. IN FOR AND WHETHER

02:59:52.314 --> 02:59:54.950

03:25:44.031 --> 03:25:45.499
STAGGERED APPROACH- BUT WITH

03:25:45.566 --> 03:25:46.467

FIRST OF ALL. THE HALF DAY

03:26:01.248 --> 03:26:04.018
KINDERGARTEN- WHICH MANY OF US

03:26:04.085 --> 03:26:06.087
HAVE OUR OWN CHILDREN AND-

03:26:06.153 --> 03:26:07.755
REALLY IS BECOMING SOMETHING OF

03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:10.391
THE PAST- AS WE SAID FOR. MORE

03:26:10.458 --> 03:26:12.626
AND MORE WORKING WOMEN

03:26:12.693 --> 03:26:14.628
PARTICULARLY WHO ARE THE ONES

03:26:14.695 --> 03:26:16.697
WHO ARE GETTING THEIR KIDS BACK.

03:26:16.764 --> 03:26:18.566
TO SCHOOL TO BE A- YOU. BUT NOT

03:26:18.632 --> 03:26:21.769
ONLY- HAVE A HALF DAY AND ONLY

03:26:21.836 --> 03:26:23.938
SAY HALF DAY IT'S REALLY. ABOUT

03:26:24.004 --> 03:26:27.174
THREE POINT FIVE HOURS- SO.

03:26:27.241 --> 03:26:28.776
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A

03:26:28.843 --> 03:26:31.378
CHILD THAT YOU NEED TO PICK UP

03:26:31.445 --> 03:26:32.513
ABOUT ELEVEN THIRTY OR BEFORE

03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:35.716
NOON- AND SOME SCHOOLS DO OFFER

03:26:35.783 --> 03:26:38.219
AFTER SCHOOL PICK A CARE. BUT

03:26:38.285 --> 03:26:40.955
CARE IS OFTEN A CARE THAT HAS TO

03:26:41.021 --> 03:26:44.158
BE PAID FOR. BUT ASIDE FROM

03:26:44.225 --> 03:26:47.695
THAT. EDUCATION OF ADDITIONAL

03:26:47.762 --> 03:26:50.264
HOURS THAT EIGHT KENDER CHILD IS

03:26:50.331 --> 03:26:54.101
IN SCHOOL REALLY HAS. AN IMPACT

03:26:54.168 --> 03:26:55.803
THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH SOME OF

03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:58.005
OUR OTHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS

03:26:58.072 --> 03:26:59.340
WHERE THEIR THEIR CHARTER

03:26:59.406 --> 03:27:02.476
WHETHER THEY'RE- PRIVATE SCHOOLS

03:27:02.543 --> 03:27:04.812
BUT- THERE IS MORE AND MORE

03:27:04.879 --> 03:27:06.247
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE CHOOSING

03:27:06.313 --> 03:27:08.549
THEIR NOT BEING MADE TO THEY'VE

03:27:08.616 --> 03:27:10.151
CHOSEN TO GO FULL DAY. BECAUSE

03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:11.952
THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN

03:27:12.019 --> 03:27:13.454
IMPORTANT PART OF TODAY'S

03:27:13.521 --> 03:27:16.123
EDUCATION SO I SUPPORT THIS.

03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:19.593
SITE AS FAR AS THE TEACHER RATIO

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:22.696
UP MYSELF OFTEN TEACHING IN THE

03:27:22.763 --> 03:27:24.498
YOUNGER GRADES- SOMETIMES IT'S A

03:27:24.565 --> 03:27:26.734
MYTH THAT YOU HAVE TO TEACHERS

03:27:26.801 --> 03:27:28.636
IN THERE BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE

03:27:28.702 --> 03:27:30.571
THERE'S ALWAYS. DIFFERENT WAYS

03:27:30.638 --> 03:27:33.207
THAT SCHOOL SITE DO DO THIS KIND

03:27:33.274 --> 03:27:36.911
OF- INJURY IN IT IT'S NOT THE

03:27:36.977 --> 03:27:38.646
FULL THREE HOURS THAT YOU HAVE

03:27:38.712 --> 03:27:40.481
TO TEACHER AND THEIR TIME THAT'S

03:27:40.548 --> 03:27:42.516
REALLY HALF OF THAT TIME- BUT

03:27:42.583 --> 03:27:46.253
THEN LASTLY WHAT I WOULD SAY. IS

03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:49.223
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

03:27:49.290 --> 03:27:50.691
ACCOMMODATING FOR TEACHING PRO

03:27:50.758 --> 03:27:54.829
AM- ADDITIONAL SPACE. A. B. IF

03:27:54.895 --> 03:27:56.163

THE PANDEMIC BUT BECAUSE OF

03:28:15.616 --> 03:28:18.018
