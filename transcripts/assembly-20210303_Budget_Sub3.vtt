HAPPY TO SEE- THIS MOVEMENT I

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.014
HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:26.250
QUESTION IS HOW THESE-

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.786

EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT'S MY

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:37.795
FIRST QUESTION ALL. YOU KNOW IF

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:38.796
YOU WANT TO ASK BOTH OF THEM

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.865
MISTER CHAIR OR JUST ASK ONE AT

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.733
A TIME. WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.635
ASK BOTH. THAT THE QUESTION

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.237
SECOND. IS WHETHER THESE

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:47.838
INSPECTORS WILL ONLY

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.506
INSPECTORATES SAY TRANSACTIONS

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:50.241
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.276
DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TRAINING AND

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.043
THE OTHER INSPECTORS BUT I JUST

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.312
WANT TO BE CLEAR TO. MAXIMIZE

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:55.846
THEIR TIME THAT AS THEY'RE

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.982
TRAVELING TO. AND FROM THESE

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.650
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS IS

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.751
THERE ANY THOUGHT TO USING THEM

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.052
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR OTHER

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.420
INSPECTIONS ALONG THE WAY SO

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:04.655
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL A

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:05.155
LONG DISTANCE TO DO ONE

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.224
INSPECTION. AND TRAVEL BACK IF

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.259
THEY'RE SORT OF INSPECTIONS

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.994
THEY CAN DO AS THEY'RE MOVING

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.362
THROUGH THAT RELATE TO YOU KNOW

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.597
ACROSS THAT THAT LAND- SO I'M

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.498
JUST THINKING ABOUT EFFICIENCY

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.000
OF TIME AND WHETHER THEIR-

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.167
TRAINING IS UP TO THE POINT

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.068
WHERE THEY CAN DO. A DEBT THOSE

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.703
ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.471

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:15.559
FOCUS WILL BE ON MEETING THE

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:18.295
INTENT OF AB THIRTY EIGHT AND

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.897
CONDUCTING THE- DEFENSIBLE

HOWEVER- WHEN THEY'RE NOT BE

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.138
GAUGE AND THAT THEY WILL NOT

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:29.540
SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.608
MISSION AND MEETING ITS GOAL OF

INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. AND I'M

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.714
NOT QUITE CERTAIN ON THE FIRST

OR WORK THAT YOU'LL BE DOING

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.143
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.278
COMPLEMENTARY AND NOT

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:11.482

HIGH FIRE ON A VERY HIGH FIRE

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.795
ZONE AREA DO YOU PROJECT OVER

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:30.667
THE COURSE OF A YEAR. THAT THE

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.236
BEGINNING AND I COULDN'T TAKE

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.337
THAT QUESTION BUT WE DID AN

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:34.972
ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF SALE

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.473
THE PROPERTY WITHIN THE STATE

AND TRANSLATED THAT TO BE S. R.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.677
A. AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:43.514
ROUGHLY. BASED ON THOSE ABOUT

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.548
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND-

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:47.384
TRANSACTIONS PER YEAR- HOWEVER

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:50.687
THAT IT'S BASED OFF OF- TWO

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:51.422
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THEN

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:52.689
AGAIN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:55.059
DATA- SO IT COULD BE HIGHER

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.828
COULD BE LOWER- AND- AND SO

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.363
WHAT AT THE OF THE PROGRAM

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.564
PROGRESSES WILL BE ABLE TO

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.633
DETERMINE. WHAT THE TRUE LEVEL

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:06.003
THE IMPACT. IS AND THEN ADJUST

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.372
ACCORDINGLY. SO YOU ANTICIPATE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:13.010
THE TWENTY SIX- SESSIONS CAN DO

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:16.413
ROUGHLY. NINE HUNDRED TO A

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.105
YOUR REPORT ON THE OTHER HAND I

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.106
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.574
JUSTIFICATION FOR DURING REAL

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:07.010
ESTATE TRANSACTIONS- THERE ARE

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.745
MANY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:09.446
SIMILAR KIND OF POINT OF SALE

00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:12.048
INSPECTIONS- AND WHEN SOMEONE

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:13.383
SPENDING YOU KNOW LARGE AMOUNTS

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.317
OF MONEY PURCHASING A PROPERTY

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.518
I THINK IT DOES BEHOOVE THEM TO

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:17.721
HAVE. THAT REPORT NOT BECAUSE

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:18.588
THEY'RE KIND OF WALKING IN A

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.090
LITTLE BLOCK AND MAYBE DON'T

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:20.523
EVEN UNDERSTAND THE

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.492

00:54:23.893 --> 00:54:24.894

WILDFIRE DOESN'T FIT NEATLY

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:14.315
INTO THE BUDGET CYCLE THE WIND

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.816
IT'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:09.270
INTERFACE FOR T. NO. AND

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.439
PRESCRIBED. WERE FIRE CAN TAKE

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:14.842
A STATE. AND A STATE DURING.

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:17.745
FIRE AND WHOLE LANDSCAPE

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.647
STRATEGY TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY.

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.315
AND RETURNING. IN AND THE NOT.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:25.252
ECOLO ROLE OF. I'M CAL PLANT.

OUT IN THIS PART AS WELL AS

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:29.623
SOME UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL

01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:32.460
CHALLENGES- THAT WILL ALLOW US

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:34.195
TO INCREASE THE PACE. ON THE

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:36.197
RESILIENT LANDSCAPES RAIMES OUR

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.065
GOAL IS TO REALLY UTILIZE

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.800
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND RETURN THE

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:42.103
NATURAL ROLE OF FIRE TO THE

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:44.138
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY- A MOST OF

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.940
CALIFORNIA'S ECOLOGY INTO FIRE

01:35:46.006 --> 01:35:48.476
ADAPTED ECOSYSTEM. SOME AREAS

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:50.978
ONE OF FIRE RETURN INTERVAL OF

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.313
THIRTY TO SIXTY YEAR. SOME OF

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.547
THE STATE ONE OF FIRE RETURN

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:55.449
INTERVALS OF TEN TO FIFTEEN BUT

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.218
MANY AREAS IN THE STATE HAVEN'T

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.752
SEEN FIRE FOR HUNDRED YEARS.

01:35:58.819 --> 01:35:59.987
WHICH IS WHAT'S GIVING US THESE

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:02.656
CATASTROPHIC FIRES. SO WE'RE

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.758
TRYING TO GET- FIRED BACK ON

01:36:04.825 --> 01:36:06.160
THE LANDSCAPE A LOT OF THAT

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.328
MEANS REDUCING THE FUEL LOOK

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.897
FIRST TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.832
NATURAL ECOLOGICAL ROLE

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:13.434
ACQUIRE. WITH CHALLENGING

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.069
CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE HAVE

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:18.339
MULTIPLE TYPES OF. A LAND

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.774
OWNERSHIP ACROSS THE STATE 57%

01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:22.243

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:29.783
STOP AND JURISDICTIONAL

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:30.985
BOUNDARIES STORE STRATEGIES

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.254
HERE ALLOW TO HAVE A PATCHWORK

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.588
OF RESILIENCE ON THE LANDSCAPE

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.190
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:39.026
WHOLE ECOSYSTEM. SO WE WORK.

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.327
AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:42.663
DIFFERENT TARGETED PROGRAMS YOU

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.131
TARGET DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:45.032
LANDSCAPE THAT CAN COME

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.734
TOGETHER AND GIVE US THAT WHOLE

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:57.144
WATERSHED. AND POOL AYE.

01:36:57.211 --> 01:37:00.447
ECOSYSTEM APPROACH YOU. THERE

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.249
WERE SOME SO EXAM OF THESE PRO

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:05.085
IN REALLY RIGHT UP ARE AT ON

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.086
EIGHT LAND THIS IS SOME OF MOST

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.488
BY DIVERSE AND UNIQUE HABITAT

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:08.722
IN THE STATE WHICH IS IT IS

LAND FACT. WE'RE ALSO INCREASED

01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:18.432
FUNDING FOR SMALL FAVORITE 20%

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:21.902
OF THE FORCE LAND IN. AND IT

TRYING TO BE A TO HOW LOT OF

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:05.579
FLEX AND- AND EASIER TO GETTING

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.615
DAHLE- TO THAT CRITICAL AND

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.683
ALSO PRESS TO BE INFORM

WHICH KEEPS OUR DAHLE OUT TO

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:19.360
GRANT IN THE AND IT'S REALLY OF

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:21.662
THE FOUNDING OF OUR APPROACH TO

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:31.772
POOREST. REALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.307

DO THAT WAS THIRTY FIVE

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:41.749
EMERGING FUEL FOR ACROSS

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:45.052
LANDSCAPE. YES BREAKS PICTURE I

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:47.288
AGREE EXAMPLE OF ONE OF HERE

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.056
WHERE IT'S A SHE AREA- YOU

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.858
REDUCE THE ON. THERE ARE ALONG

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:53.694
ROAD. TO THE DOUBLE A SKI.

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.463
AWARD TO APPROACH A FIRE. THESE

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.999
ARE QUITE AND- TOOLS DURING A

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.267
CATASTROPHIC FIRE TO BE ABLE

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:02.202
HELP NOT ONLY POTENTIAL HOLD.

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.605
LINE OR RIGHT OF FIRE BUT TO

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.573
ALLOW P. TO STATE I'M HERE THE

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.509
COP OF THE- OF. FUEL BREAKS ARE

01:39:08.575 --> 01:39:11.045
DOWN- A DOWN AND DIEGO AND THE

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:13.647
IN THEM AND EMPIRE. AND- THE

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:16.216
BOTTOM. IS A FEW YOU'LL BREAK

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:19.186
IMPAIRED- IN HE CAN'T. WE AS

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:20.554
YOU CAN SEE THE TREES RISK BUT

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.089
THERE STAND THAT WILL BREAK

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:24.825
WASN'T EVEN MANNED BY FIRE. AT

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:27.828

PROTECT THE TOWN OF STERLING.

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:31.999
SO THE STRATEGIC FEEL BREAKS

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:33.400
ARE CLOSE AND FUNDING WILL

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.235
ALLOW CALTRAIN HERE TO BE ABLE

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:36.370
TO INCREASE THE FUEL THEY PUT

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:37.237
THE GROUND AS WELL AS GETTING

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:39.540
MORE. DAHLE OUT COMMUNITY. TO

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.141
PUT ST YOU FUEL RIGHT AROUND

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:49.850
THERE IN. THE NIGHT AREA IS

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:53.087
GOING TO BE V. IS ANYTHING

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.722
HERE'S ANOTHER PHOTO. THE SPACE

AND OUR HOME THIS NEW AREA

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:58.325
REALLY LOW AT. COMMUNITY AND

01:39:58.392 --> 01:39:59.960
HOW HARDENING HOW WE HELP.

HOME. AND AND THESE REALLY. AND

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:12.306
ALLOWS A HIGHER PRICE TO BE

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:16.577
ABLE TO PROTECT. BETTER AND

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:19.480
TWO. A WILD. MORE IMPORTANT OUR

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.915
IMPORTANT ALSO WHO HARD THIS IS.

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:24.151
IN SMALL. FRACTURE FITS ON A TO

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:25.786
BE ABLE TO AND- ITS- ARE.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:28.055
DURING WHAT. THE FIRE MARSHAL

FUEL FOR. AND YOUR LAST

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:39.400
BUILDING BACK INTO. EIGHT AND

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.402
SO WE STARTED HOMES IN THE CAMP

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:44.772
PERKS. BILL BEFORE. BUILT AFTER-TWO. EIGHT HOW A FIFTY TO. PER

SURVIVE RATE WERE THESE PUMP.

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:48.509
STANDARDS WHEREAS HOMES BUILT

01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:50.277
BEFORE HAD A PERCENT SURVIVAL.

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:51.512
SO THERE'S A LOT COMMUNITY CAN

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:55.115
DO. IN THE WAY TARGET HOME KERR.

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:58.252
IS TO ENSURE THAT- THAT WE ARE.

01:40:58.318 --> 01:41:00.988

ON THE ADDRESS. CLEANING OUT

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.761
THE GUTTERS- IN DEFENSE OF

INVESTING IN THE UC

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.603
FIREFIGHTERS FIRST INCREASING

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.105
THE OF REACH CAPACITY OF OUR

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:20.707
DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PROGRAMS AND

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.409
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS

HOMEOWNER CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.714
THESE RECORDS THAT. AND SO WE

FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:38.292
FEDERAL MATCHING WOULD BE

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:48.802
POTENTIALLY. SEVENTY FIVE

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:49.436
MILLION DOLLARS EVEN THAT'S NOT

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.305
I'M MILLION DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE

REACH HIGHER SO. THAT CENTURY

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:05.452
LEVEL- WHAT WE BEEN ARE HARD.

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:12.226
COMMUNITY I. THREE FOUR THAT

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:13.427
YOU CURRENTLY NEED COMMUNITY

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:16.897
HOW. WHILE URBAN. AND WE'RE THE

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:17.898
SEVERITY OF FIRE ACTUALLY

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:20.567
THEY'RE MORE EQUAL WORLD ON THE

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:23.637
REVERSE FOR SO YOU. BUT I DON'T

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:26.073
THAT WE'VE BEEN. SEVERAL APPS

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.541
THAT HAVE BEEN SLOWING THAT.

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:28.375
ONE OF THE MAJOR ONE IS GETTING

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:30.711
WORK FOR CREW AND BUSINESS

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:31.478
NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO. UP TO BE

ACT DO THE WORK. ONE OF THE

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:35.249
CHALLENGES WE HAVE WHEN WE'RE

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:38.218
DOING THIS. AND IS AS CAN SEE

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:41.188
THESE THE INSIDE SLASH PILES

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:45.926
THIS IS A- OF A- I WAS STYLE OF

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:47.728
ANTI IF YOU LOOK IN THE LOWER

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:49.596
RIGHT HAND CORNER THAT IS. AND

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.364
THE FOR SERVICE SEVERAL YEARS

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.865
AGO GET ASK ME THAT THEY WERE

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:54.868
ABOUT FORTY OF SLASHED BY. IN

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:57.170
THE TOP WILL BE ALONE TO. WAYS

01:42:57.237 --> 01:42:58.438
TO JUST OF THIS WOULD BE BY A

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.707
IS COOL. INCREASE BUSINESS ARE

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.876
THAT EVEN SENSE. SO ONE OF THE

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:06.813
A- WE PROPOSE IS CLIMATE. FUNDS

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.752
WHICH HELP CREATE- AND- WERE AT

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:13.687
LOWING LENDING FOR STARTING UP.

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.055
IN IS BOTH IN. AND NOT

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.957
TRADITIONAL SECTORS SO

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:21.795
BUSINESSES ARE. SAWMILLS TO. I

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:22.896

BUILDINGS AND CALIFORNIA

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:58.465
BUILDING CODE JUST. TO A UP TO

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:00.033
EIGHTEEN. WHICH MAKES VERY. IN

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:20.687
BYRON- BEFORE HE'S- NEW. WHICH

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.289
IS THAT- IT WHICH IS THAT

ACTUALLY REDUCE THE

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:40.207
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ON THAT HELLO

PARTICIPATING THROUGHOUT THE

01:44:47.147 --> 01:44:48.649
SIERRA AND THEY ARE GETTING

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.617
EMPLOYED BY MANY OF THESE-

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.918
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:56.223
PUTTING OUT ON THE GROUND. AND

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:56.857
THE FUEL REDUCTION WORK THAT WE

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:58.358
ARE DOING. IN ADDITION TO THE

01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.893
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THE

NEED FOR A BUSINESS INVESTMENT

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:04.431
IN THIS SECTOR THERE'S- SEVERAL

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:06.700
OTHER UNDERLYING ISSUES ONE IS

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:08.502
WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON-

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:11.071
STREAMLINING PERMITTING WE HAVE

CREATED. A FAST TRACK FOR- BY

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.008
DOING A PRE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.710
ANALYSIS ON TWENTY MILLION

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.178
ACRES THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.414
AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS-

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.782
TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW WATER

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:25.152
BOARDS. TO BE ABLE TO. THINK

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:26.286

SEQUEL PROCESS DOWN TO ABOUT

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.992
TWO MONTHS. AND WHEN GRANT YOU

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:34.161

CDFW ADD THEIR FISH AND

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:40.300
WILDLIFE IS COVERED UNDER WATER

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.401
BOARDS ARE COVERED. SO WE'RE

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:42.569
CREATING FASTER TRACKS ON

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.171
PERMITTING AND FINALLY ONE OF

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:45.505
THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS IS THAT

01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:47.107
WE ARE GROUNDING BASED IN

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:50.043
SCIENCE. SO REALLY INVESTING IN

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:54.014
SCIENCE- AND DATA TECHNOLOGY WE

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:55.282
ARE ENSURING THAT WE ARE

01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:57.417
IMPROVING OUR MODELS. AND OUR

MODELING WERE. DOING PREDICTIVE

01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:02.823
ANALYSIS AND SAPPHIRE MODELING

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:05.258
SO THAT WE ARE DESIGNING ALL OF

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:06.593
THESE WATERSHED SCALE

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.662
APPROACHES. AT THE HIGHEST

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.297
LEVEL. BLUSTERY I WANT TO

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:11.064
MENTION AND THEN WE'LL TAKE

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:14.067
QUESTIONS IS HOW THIS ALL FITS

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.836
INTO THE REGIONAL STRATEGY ONE

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.137
OF THE AREAS IN THIS BUDGET IS

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.505
AN EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:19.606

TO LOOK SMALL WHEN OWNERS- AND

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:40.260
IT DOES LANDOWNER. BRING THEM

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.962
ALL TO THE TO DESIGN IT THAT

01:46:42.028 --> 01:46:42.829
WAY FOR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:45.298
HAVE BEEN HOW. MANY OF THE-

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:47.000
COLLABORATIVELY RECEIVED GRANT.

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:48.568
FROM OUR TO BUY A TO PASS

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:50.537
PROGRAM. HOWEVER THEY OFTEN

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.105
LACK THE DOLLARS TO DO NEED TO

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:54.941
REACH SCALE WATER SCALE. TO BE

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:56.543
ABLE TO USE THE SCIENCE THAT

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:57.878
WE'RE GETTING TO DESIGN THEIR

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:59.913

ANALYSIS IN GETTING THAT DONE

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:11.324
FASTER. SO WE HAVE INVESTIGATED

01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:12.826
IT AT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION

COMMITTEE WHICH HAD MORE

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:36.776

DECADES HAVE BEEN AMONG THE

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:01.601
WORST IN TERMS OF FIRE DAMAGE

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.603

STATE'S RECORDED HISTORY AND SO

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:06.640
WE THINK THAT PACKAGE DOES

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.208
BUILD ON ACTIONS THE

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:09.542
LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.578
TAKEN IN PRIOR YEARS SUCH AS-

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:13.213
THE ADOPTION OF SB NINE A ONE

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.048
TO. EXPAND PREVENTION AND

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:16.549
MITIGATION ACTIVITIES THAT VERY

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.184

SENSE OF THE RANGE OF

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.125
CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FIRE-

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:27.394
WILDFIRE PROBLEM AND DIFFERENT

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.562
COMMUNITIES. HAVE DIFFERENT

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:35.035
CHALLENGES SPECIFIC. TO THEM

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:35.902
AND SO HAVING A- THE PACKAGE

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:38.605
THE A- PARTICULAR TIME FOR THEM

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.674
TO. FOR EXAMPLE ALL OUR EGGS

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.408
ONE- AND SO WE THINK

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:42.142
ADMINISTRATION PACKAGE PROVIDE

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.110
YOU A REASONABLE TO. IN LOOKING

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:46.579
FORWARD TO A BROADER WILDFIRE

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.581
REDUCTION STRATEGY- THAT SAID

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:49.749
THIS ISN'T THE ONLY WAY YOU

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.151
COULD STRUCTURE A PACKAGE AND

01:49:51.217 --> 01:49:53.119
SO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS FOR

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:55.889
YOUR- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:59.192
THE FIRST IT IS LOOKING AT THE

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:00.527
ONE TIME NATURE OF THE GENERAL

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:04.097
FUND PROPOSED SO IN TOTAL SIX

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:04.731
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:06.199
THE BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSED

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:07.801
TO BE FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:10.003
A ONE TIME NATURE NOW IN MANY

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:11.438
CASES THOSE ONE TIME DOLLARS

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:12.839
WILL BE SPENT OVER MULTIPLE

01:50:12.906 --> 01:50:14.708
YEARS OF THE PROJECT TAKE.

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.242
MULTIPLE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT AND

01:50:16.309 --> 01:50:18.778
DEVELOP- THAT SAID EVEN WITH

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:22.148
THE SCALE OF. THIS PACKAGE-

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:23.683
THAT THE SCALE O THE PROBLEM

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:25.385
IN CALIFORNIA IS OF COURSE MUCH

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:26.753
LARGER WHETHER YOU'RE THINKING

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.089
ABOUT THE- TENS OF MILLIONS OF

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:31.191
ACRES OF FOREST LAND THAT WOULD

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:32.692
BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT FOR THE-

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.527
MILLIONS OF HOMES IN THE MOVIE

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:35.662
THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:38.198
HARDENING. THIS FUNDING PACKAGE

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.933
WILL ONLY ADDRESS A RELATIVELY

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.202
SMALL SHARE OF THE IDENTIFIED

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:46.840
PROBLEM. AND SO WE THINK ONE

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.008
IMPORTANT. WHAT IT WOULD WE

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:49.609
THINK WE ARE AT THE MINISTRY.

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.945
READ THE PROPOSING ONE GENERAL

01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:53.179
FUND IT BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.748
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:55.982
DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE

01:50:56.049 --> 01:50:57.384
CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA. BUDGET

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:58.952
PROPOSAL DO WE THINK THAT

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:00.253
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WE DO THINK

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.521
THAT DOES IMPLY THAT THERE'S

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.957
VALUE IN THE SPRING AND IN

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:06.026
FUTURE MONTHS THE- H.

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.660
INTIMIDATION WORKING TOGETHER

01:51:07.727 --> 01:51:09.162
TO. THINK ABOUT WHAT A LONGER

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:11.131
TERM STRATEGY IS BEYOND THIS

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:13.166
BILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:16.269
ACTUALLY SUCH A FAMILIAR DOCKS.

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:18.004
THE NEXT ISSUE I WANT TO TALK

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:20.573
ABOUT WAS THE- EARLY ACTION

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.409

AS A BIT OF CONTACT OUR OFFICE

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:33.319
EARLY ACTION WITHOUT A VERY

01:51:33.386 --> 01:51:36.356
STRONG RATIONALE. IN THAT EARLY

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:37.690
JUST BECAUSE IN PARTICULARLY.

DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.772
REAL NATIONAL FOR ADOPTING SOME

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:55.475
EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS ONE IS

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:56.643
WITH RESPECT TO THE G. JAR

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.745

COULD MAKE THAT IT. WOULD MAKE

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.508
IT. CONCEPTUALLY THAT IF WE CAN

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.243

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:45.692
BENEFITS THAT COULD PROVIDE.

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:47.961
COULD MERIT CONSIDERATION OF

EARLY ACTION ADOPTION. ONE

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:51.097
CONCERN WE HAVE THERE IS THAT

PURPOSES AND I THINK IT'S

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.812
PRUDENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:15.481

WITH TWO PRINCIPLES IN MIND.

01:59:36.602 --> 01:59:38.371
THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUNDING

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:39.438
HAS TO GO TOWARDS FIRE

01:59:39.505 --> 01:59:42.208
PREVENTION AND SECOND THE

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.343

UNFORTUNATELY DURING THESE

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:30.289
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THEY'VE

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:32.691
BEEN A SOURCE. OF MORE CARBON

ENCOMPASSES UGH FIRE IN A VERY

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.739
HOLISTIC WAY TAKING INTO

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:23.141
ACCOUNT WATERSHEDS AND IMPACTS

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:25.911
ON WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY IN

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:27.579
AND EVERYTHING THAT REALLY- IS

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:30.048
IMPACTED BY BY THE WILDFIRES-

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:31.850
SO IT'S NICE TO SEE IT LOOKED

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:33.852
AT HOLISTICALLY SO THAT ALL OF

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:34.953
THOSE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.121
AREN'T TRAMPLED ON AS WE

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.322
SOMETIMES SEEN IN THE PAST YOU

02:11:37.389 --> 02:11:39.524
KNOW- SO THAT THEY'RE ALL

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:40.826
RESPECTED AND GIVEN THEIR

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:42.894
PROPER PLACE SO I I'M- REALLY

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:44.796
HAPPY TO SEE THAT I DO HAVE

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:45.897
SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE. THAT

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:47.499
ARE A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT THE

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:49.301
MECHANIC SO I APOLOGIZE FOR

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.736
THAT BUT I WANT TO JUST

02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:52.337
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WE'RE

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:54.106
THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THIS SO.

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:56.174
THE PRESCRIBED FIRE WE KNOW

02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:58.410
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DATA AND

02:11:58.477 --> 02:11:59.978
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:01.647
OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AND- YOU

02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:02.481
KNOW THE CHALLENGES AND

02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:03.949
DIFFICULTIES AS WELL OF

02:12:04.016 --> 02:12:06.551
UTILIZING IT. SO THE FIRST

02:12:06.618 --> 02:12:07.819
MINUTE TREAT A MANAGEMENT TASK

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:09.621
FORCE REPORT RECOMMENDED

02:12:09.688 --> 02:12:10.756
ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:12.057
PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:14.159
CENTER. AND DEVELOPMENT SO THAT

02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:14.960
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:16.662
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW QUALIFIED TO

02:12:16.728 --> 02:12:18.330
DO THIS WORK AND MORE OF THEM.

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:19.865
BECAUSE PRESCRIBED FIRES BEEN

02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:21.300
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:12:21.366 --> 02:12:22.868
USING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF.

02:12:22.934 --> 02:12:24.569
KIND OF HURDLES OF FULLY

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:26.405
IMPLEMENTING IT SO. YOU KNOW I

02:12:26.471 --> 02:12:27.572
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:12:27.639 --> 02:12:29.574
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE RAMPED UP

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:30.442
INTO AREAS WHERE WE THINK IT'S

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:32.744
APPROPRIATE. SO THEY ALSO

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:33.779
RECOMMENDED DEVELOPING AN

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:35.647
AUTOMATED PRESCRIBE BOB COULD

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:37.482
PRESCRIBE BURN PERMIT. AND I'M

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:38.717
WONDERING IF THE EXPENDITURE

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.385
PLAN COVERS THE COST OF

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.254
BEGINNING ALL OF THAT WORK. AND

02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:44.589
TANGENTIALLY A LOT OF THE FIRE

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.224
EXPERTS ALSO TALK ABOUT HAVING

02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:46.725
BERMAN BOSSES THAT ARE

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:48.894
EXPERIENCED- AND SO I'M

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:50.128
WONDERING ABOUT KIND OF HOW WE

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:51.697
DEVELOP HOW WE GET ALL THIS

02:12:51.763 --> 02:12:53.332
GOING BECAUSE- WE CAN TALK

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:54.566
ABOUT THE NEED FOR IT BUT WE

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:55.233
ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.335
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT

02:12:56.401 --> 02:12:58.303
SO. IN THE BUDGET IS ALL IS

02:12:58.370 --> 02:13:02.641
BLUE OR THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:04.476
CONSIDERED AN FUNDED. THE NEXT

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:05.377
ONE QUESTION I'M GONNA TURN IT

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:06.411
JUST AGAIN JUST A MOMENT I

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:07.713
WANTED TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE

02:13:07.779 --> 02:13:09.081
THAT YOU KNOW PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:10.649
IS A- IS A PRACTICE THAT OUR

02:13:10.716 --> 02:13:11.516
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN

02:13:11.583 --> 02:13:13.051
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN USING FOR.

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:15.220
SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. AND

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:16.455
OSTALIH AND IRONICALLY IT WAS

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:19.224
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN YOU

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:20.392
KNOW DECADES SOUTH ACTUALLY

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:21.793
RESTRICTED THOSE PRESCRIBED

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.529
BURNING PRACTICES SO. AMONG ALL

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.197
OVER DOING ON PRESCRIBED

02:13:25.263 --> 02:13:26.965
BURNING A LOT OF IT IS LEARNING

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:29.735
FROM. OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS. BUT

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.403
JESSICA CAN YOU TALK WE WE'VE

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.138
WE'VE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:35.107
BARRIERS THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.408
TO ACTUALLY GET MORE PRESCRIBED

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:38.176
FIRE ON THE LAND. CAN YOU TALK

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:39.478
WITH DIRECTLY ABOUT WHERE OUR

02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:41.780
INVESTMENTS ARE FOCUSED- IN IN

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:43.982
THIS PROPOSAL ON REMOVING THOSE

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:46.385
BARRIERS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.854
FOR THE QUESTION- SO WHAT WE'VE

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:49.521
WE'RE BUILDING OUT SOME

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:50.489
INVESTMENTS WE MADE IN THE

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:52.457
PREVIOUS YEAR SOME CAL FIRE HAS

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:54.259
INCREASED ITS PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:13:54.326 --> 02:13:56.128
PROGRAM. IT'S PAST TRAINING

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.596
PROGRAM AND ITS PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.264
CREWS SO OUR OWN IN HOUSE

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:01.099
WORKFORCE. IS EXPANDING

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:02.968
DRAMATICALLY- I'M MORE ALSO

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:04.669
PUTTING THESE OF COURSE

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:06.705
RESILIENCE DOLLARS WHICH ARE

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.840
AND- WHICH ARE ARE REALLY CAN'T

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.842
BE FOCUSED ON PRESCRIBED FIRE.

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.611
THERE'S FUNDING HERE FOR THE

02:14:12.677 --> 02:14:15.113
AIRPORTS I'M TO BE ABLE TO WORK

CALIFORNIA AND- TO INCREASE

02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:24.356
THOSE BURNT WINDOWS ONE OF THE

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:25.424
LARGEST HURDLES WE STILL HAVE

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.125
THOUGH. IS THE PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:14:27.192 --> 02:14:29.394
LIABILITY AND THAT'S ADDRESSED-

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:31.296

AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:39.438
TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH BUT

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:41.440
UNTIL WE SOLVE. THE LIABILITY

02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:43.108
CHALLENGE- THAT'S GOING TO

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.277
CONTINUE TO BE. A LARGE HURDLE

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:46.645
TO PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT NOW WE

02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:47.679

DIVERTED TO FIRE SUPPRESSION

02:15:22.314 --> 02:15:23.348
AND JUST SORT OF PULLED AWAY

FROM. THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:28.119
AND ALSO WHETHER CAL FIRE HAS A

02:15:28.186 --> 02:15:30.555

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.549
MENTIONED THAT THE FEBRUARY

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:14.850
AUCTION RESULTS DO SHOW THAT

02:58:14.917 --> 02:58:17.420
REVENUES. ARE TRACKING SLIGHTLY

02:58:17.486 --> 02:58:18.854
HIGHER THAN WHAT THE OF THE

02:58:18.921 --> 02:58:20.423
BUDGET ASSUMES BUT WE WILL HAVE

02:58:20.489 --> 02:58:22.458
MORE INFORMATION- AFTER THE MAY

02:58:22.525 --> 02:58:23.259
AUCTION RESULTS ARE RELEASED AS

02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:25.828
WELL. ONE IMPORTANT THING WE DO

02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:26.595
WANT TO NOTICE THAT THE

02:58:26.662 --> 02:58:28.230
PROPOSAL WOULD LEAVES ARE

02:58:28.297 --> 02:58:29.432
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A HUNDRED

02:58:29.498 --> 02:58:31.700
MILLION DOLLARS- AND AS SORT OF

02:58:31.767 --> 02:58:33.569
A RESERVE IN THE FUND AFTER

02:58:33.636 --> 02:58:34.336
BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND

02:58:34.403 --> 02:58:35.971
BUDGET YEAR. WE DO THINK THIS

02:58:36.038 --> 02:58:37.840
IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT

02:58:37.907 --> 02:58:39.775
IT'S ABOUT 5% OF ANNUAL

02:58:39.842 --> 02:58:41.911
REVENUE. IS RELATIVELY SMALL

02:58:41.977 --> 02:58:44.246
GIVEN- THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY

02:58:44.313 --> 02:58:46.082
AND SO WE THINK THAT OVER THE

02:58:46.148 --> 02:58:48.451
LONG TERM- THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:58:48.517 --> 02:58:49.452
SHOULD CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:50.853
PROMOTING. LONG TERM FUND

02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:51.987
SOLVENCY AND FUNDING

02:58:52.054 --> 02:58:54.156
PREDICTABILITY- ONE EXAMPLE

02:58:54.223 --> 02:58:56.826
WOULD BE TO- CONSIDER JUST A

02:58:56.892 --> 02:58:59.295
LARGER RESERVE- AND THERE'S NO

02:58:59.361 --> 02:59:00.362
REAL MAGIC NUMBER AND KIND OF

02:59:00.429 --> 02:59:01.897
WHAT THEY ARE THE BEST KIND OF

02:59:01.964 --> 02:59:04.400
SIZE OF A- RESERVE WOULD BE.

02:59:04.467 --> 02:59:05.367
BUT WE DO THINK A GOOD STARTING

02:59:05.434 --> 02:59:06.735
POINT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU

02:59:06.802 --> 02:59:09.472
KNOW ROUGHLY 10% OR OR ABOUT

02:59:09.538 --> 02:59:10.206
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:59:10.272 --> 02:59:11.807
OUR SERVERS DIRECTOR TO

02:59:11.874 --> 02:59:13.175
MAINTAIN THAT SOLVENCY AND

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:14.677
PREDICTABILITY. THE FINAL POINT

02:59:14.743 --> 02:59:18.114
IS- EARLY ACTION- THERE IS A

02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:18.747
SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION

02:59:18.814 --> 02:59:19.915
DOLLARS AS PART OF EARLY

02:59:19.982 --> 02:59:22.284
ACTION. MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:23.652
BROWN MENTIONED KIND OF OUR

02:59:23.719 --> 02:59:31.827
OFFICES. OVERALL THOUGHTS ON

02:59:31.894 --> 02:59:32.461
THIS WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.263
A STRONG. FOR EARLY I WOULD GET

02:59:34.330 --> 02:59:36.632
THE WHILE. PIECE THAT'S BEEN A

02:59:36.699 --> 02:59:38.634
ONE ONE. P. SORT OF- THAT. BUT

02:59:38.701 --> 02:59:42.238
A LOT OF THE OTHER AT. ARE ARE.

02:59:42.304 --> 02:59:43.005
SPENDING PROPOSALS PART PACKAGE

02:59:43.072 --> 02:59:44.473
DO NOT MESS. AND SO WE THINK.

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:45.407
OF THE LEGISLATURE SPOKEN

02:59:45.474 --> 02:59:46.675
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ACTION

02:59:46.742 --> 02:59:47.877
FUNDING AND JUST FOCUS. ON A

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:49.178
WILDFIRE FOR A IS ONE OF. YOU

02:59:49.245 --> 02:59:49.745
KNOW THERE ARE IF THERE ARE

02:59:49.812 --> 02:59:50.679
SOME HIGH. PROGRAMS THE WHAT IS

02:59:50.746 --> 02:59:52.414
THE DOES ONE TO ALLOCATE MONEY

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:55.518
IF YOU- A FEW MONTHS EARLIER-

02:59:55.584 --> 02:59:56.418

02:59:56.485 --> 02:59:57.753
MUCH MONEY IS ESSENTIALLY IN

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:59.221
THE BANK WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW

02:59:59.288 --> 03:00:00.356
MUCH MONEY WAS COLLECTED SO

03:00:00.422 --> 03:00:02.291
FAR. AND THEY START POPULATION

03:00:02.358 --> 03:00:04.126
SO FAR THAT'S ABOUT FIVE

03:00:04.193 --> 03:00:04.994
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:06.595

KNOW- USING THAT AMOUNT- WHICH

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:13.269
WOULD BE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN

03:00:13.335 --> 03:00:13.836
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

03:00:13.903 --> 03:00:14.970
