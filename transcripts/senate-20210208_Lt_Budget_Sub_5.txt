THIS IS A JOINT HEARING BETWEEN THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FIVE. SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND THE SENATE BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COMMITTEE. THIS HEARING WILL COVER THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECENT AUDITS ON THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT'S. MANAGEMENT OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS A RESULT OF THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INCREASED FROM FOUR POINT 3% IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. TO SIXTEEN POINT PROCESS MORE THAN SEVENTEEN MILLION CLAIMS AND PAID OUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN YOU I BENEFITS. THIS COMPARES TO JUST THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CLAIMS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND TEN. LET ME REPEAT. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TEN GREAT RECESSION THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CLAIMS WERE PROCESSED. BETWEEN APRIL AND NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY EDT PRCESS MORE THAN SEVENTEEN MILLION CLAIMS AND PAID OUT MORE THAN A HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN YOU I BENEFITS. IN ADDITION THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW WAGE WORKERS WOMEN AND LATINOS WOULD THAT WERE HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC WITH LATINOS ACCOUNTING 450% OF JOB LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY ALMOST ALL JOB LOSSES HAVE BEEN AMONG WORKERS WITH LESS THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. INDUSTRIES LIKE TOURISM TRAVEL FOOD SERVICE AND COMMENDATIONS SO I 22404% DECLINE IN EMPLOYMENT. MY DISTRICT OFFICE AS I IMAGINE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAS RECEIVED IN TOTAL THOUSANDS OF CALLS SINCE THE PANDEMIC BROKE OUT FROM CONSTITUENTS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS. MANY STRUGGLE TO GET THROUGH THE ED'S PHONE LINES OR WAIT HOURS OR DAYS FOR ID DOT ME TO PROCESS CAUSING CONSTITUENTS TO TIME OUT OF THE SYSTEM OR EVEN BE DISQUALIFIED. THIS LEAVES MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS STUCK WITH PENDING CLAIMS OR BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM BENEFITS THE STATE MUST ACT FASTER TO ENSURE THAT WE DO OUR PART IN GETTING RELIEF TO WORKERS MOST IN NEED. ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE HERE TO SIMPLY LAY BLAME WE NEED TO KNOW THE SOLUTIONS AND WHAT RESOURCES IT WILL TAKE TO FIX THE PROBLEMS. IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE ADD AND BANK OF AMERICA REGARDING THE AUDITS GOT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS REYES BY THE STATE AUDITOR. TO HELP ENSURE THE SYSTEM IS BETTER PREPARED TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS WE WILL HOLD OUR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE THREE PANELS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TESTIMONY. BEFORE WE BEGIN SENATORS CORTEZ C. AND PROBABLY IT'LL DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS WITH. THIS PUTS US CENTER W. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL ROLE OF EFFICIENT AND NIMBLE LIVERY OF SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN TIMES OF NEED AND MY DISTRICT THOUSANDS OF CONSTITUENTS ARE SUFFERING BY THE INEFFICIENCY AND THE DELAY IN RECEIVING THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FAMILIES ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. WE CANNOT CAN YOU CONTINUE TO FAIL CALIFORNIANS AND MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS NOW AND PREVENT ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING AND THAT THE RECENT EDT AUDIT FINDINGS AND WORKING TOWARDS IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. AS ACTING CHAIR OF THE SENATE BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COMMITTEE FOR THIS HEARING I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THE INFORMATION BANK OF AMERICA WILL PROVIDE AS OUR PARTNER SINCE THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS WERE FROZEN IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN BUILDING WITH A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE SUPPORT TO RESOLVE THE CASE THE ACCOUNT ISSUES I HOPE THIS HEARING WILL ALSO PROVIDE CLARITY ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE STATE'S COLLABORATION WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO ENSURE THAT ALL PARTS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR W. TO CENTER COURT BECAUSE HE- THANK YOU MELCHER. THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU. FOR YOUR- EFFORTS IN PARTNERING WITH THE OTHER TWO COMMITTEES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS HEARING CAME TOGETHER TODAY- COMMITTEES ARE DIFFICULT TIMES AND FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TEN YEARS IF THE EDT IS BEEN ASKED TO STEP IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTEDTO BE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME NOT TWICE IN EVERY TEN YEARS OCCURRENCE- THAT SAID- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE TODAY AND GOING FORWARD- IN MANY CASES. IN THE FACE OF NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK EDT HAS DONE WHAT FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT- EXPECTED TO DO. WELL WHEN HE STOOD UP THIS PROGRAM IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE AND THAT'S TO PROVIDE- BENEFITS SAFETY NET BENEFITS. BUT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEYOND. REMISS IF I DID NOT KNOW. THAT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA SAYS WAS JUST. OUTLINED BY THE OTHER TWO CHAIRS- WELL I SALUTE THE EMPLOYEES IN MANAGEMENT. WHO HAVE- MADE MUCH. OF A GOOD WORK HAPPEN IN TERMS OF ANY BENEFITS OUT AS WAS JUST DESCRIBED- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT BENEFITS ME UNFAIRLY DILUTE DELAYED OR DENIED. IS UNACCEPTABLE IN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY ASKING MORE. OF US THAN THIS. I'D I WANT TO SHOW THAT THE- AS A BOY I HEARD MY GRANDFATHER WAS A GREAT MENTOR OF MINE APPROACH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL ON BEHALF. OF A FRIEND OF HIS WHO IS EXPERIENCING GREAT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN THE US ELECTED OFFICIALS IF HE WOULD TRY TO HELP HIS FRIEND. IN THE RESPONSE BY THE ELECTED OFFICIAL WAS I'LL TRY TO HELP HIM A LITTLE BIT. MY GRANDFATHER'S RESPONSE WAS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HELP SOMEONE. YOU DON'T HELP THEM A LITTLE BIT. HE HELPED THEM ALL THE WAY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACING TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS FRUSTRATION IS AMONG OTHERS. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT FRAUD TODAY BUT WILL ALSO HEAR ABOUT THE LADIES. OF THE LACK OF ABILITY AND CAPACITY TO HANDLE INCOMING CALLS. AGAIN WHICH WAS JUST OUTLINED BY THE OTHER TWO CHAIRS. I DID A LITTLE BIT OF SIMPLE MATH THEIR HUNDRED FIFTY OPEN CASES BEING HANDLED BY MY STAFF CURRENTLY. IF THAT WERE THE CASE ON AVERAGE. OF FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS THERE'S EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CASES. THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON AND SUPPORTED BY FOLKS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES- ORDINARILY WOULD NOT. HANDLE THAT KIND OF WORKLOAD. AND DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO SO THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE MAYORS AND COUNCIL MEMBERS A COUNTY SUPERVISORS ANOTHER ELECTED OFFICIAL STAFF WHO WERE. TRYING TO STEP UP AND HELP. SO THIS IS A BIG BIG ISSUE ALL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT I PLEDGE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE OTHER TWO COMMITTEES- AND AS CHAIR OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN. EDT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC. BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION FOR US FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING EMPLOYERS. IS THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR CONTINUE TO GET YOUR PAYCHECKS. SO THAT WE CAN GET OURS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE FRUSTRATION IS. THEN THAT I THINK IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR LOOK FOR THE REST OF THE HEARING. THANK YOU CENTER COURTESY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR NIELSEN VICE CHAIR OF THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE. SENATOR NELSON DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND FELLOW TERRORISTS WHO ARE FACILITATING THIS EXTRAORDINARY IMPORTANT. CONVENING I HAVE SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER A LONG TIME AND I'VE DEALT WITH MANY DYSFUNCTIONAL AGENCIES. BUT NEVER ONE DYSFUNCTIONAL TO THE DEGREE OF THE EDT. NOW THE PANDEMIC PROBABLY IS MORE DISASTROUS BECAUSE IT'S LIFE OR DEATH. BUT THIS DISASTER IS VERY CAN TO THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIVES IT IS DISRUPTED. ALL CALLS TO THE OFFICE ARE SIMILAR TO YOURS. AND THE MOST SAD PART ABOUT IT IS PEOPLE BREAKING DOWN WEEPING ONE ONE OF MY STAFF ANSWERED THE PHONE. WE PAY BECAUSE THEY FINALLY GOT A HUMAN VOICE TO TALK TO. AND THE FRUSTRATION OF LOSING THEIR APARTMENT LOSING THEIR HOME NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS BECAUSE OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL AGENCY WHOSEEMS TO AND PROVIDING REMEDIES. ONLY EXACERBATED THE DISASTER. THIS CANNOT BE A HEARING THAT RESULTS IN JUST REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE PROGRESS. I DON'T WANT ANY REPORTS FROM THE AGENCY- MEANINGLESS WE NEED STATUTORY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE CONDUCT OF THE AGENCY THAT MAYBE EVEN THE APPOINTMENT OF AN INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT'S CLEAR THEY CANNOT WATCH OVER THEMSELVES. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WE WILL EVER BROUGHT IN GOVERNMENT DURING OUR TENURE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON WE HAVE TWO HANDS ON SO THAT THAT WE CAN GET RIGHT INTO THE- THE PANELS SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU CENTER AS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT- EDT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS LIKE OTHERS THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THEY'RE FACING. THE FAILURES HERE ARE APPALLING AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT THERE ARE STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THIS TYPE OF FEAR YOU'RE NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. BUT I WOULDN'T EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FIXING THIS RIGHT NOW. WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED STRUCTURAL REFORMS BUT THIS IS AN URGENT AND IMMEDIATE ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS UNEMPLOYED WORKERS. MY OFFICE LIKE EVERY OTHER OFFICE WE'RE HEARING FROM IS GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THEIR WITS SPANNED ABOUT GETTING THEIR EDT PAYMENTS. THESE ARE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF BEING UNEMPLOYED DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT NOW BECAUSE OF THE FAILURES OF EDT AND BANK OF AMERICA. THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH A WHOLE NEW SET OF DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS ARE FROZEN THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR FUNDS AND AS A RESULT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MAKING THE RENTAL PAYMENTS. WE NEED TO FIX THIS NOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THESE FOLKS HOLE. AND I WNT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THESE FAILURES ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDING OVERDRAFT FEES LATE CHARGES FOR MISSED PAYMENTS AND NEGATIVE CREDIT SCORE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY BUT AGAIN ONE EMPHASIZED WE CAN'T JUST BE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL REFORMS WE HAVE TO FIX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE NOW. THANKS SENATOR JOE BOWEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR NUMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IT'S BEEN NEARLY A YEAR SINCE THE GOVERNOR BEGAN SHUTTERING BUSINESSES AND MASSIVE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR JOBS OVER THIS TIME WE HAVE HEARD HORROR STORIES FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE NOT ONLY FACE THE PAIN OF LOSING THEIR JOBS BUT THE ADDED INSULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR YOU AYE BENEFITS AND OR RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. PARTY MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE RENT. THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO STAY HOME THEIR EMPLOYEES TO SHUT DOWN ANOTHER STATE IS FAILING TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY NEED US THE MOST. THERE HAS BEEN USED. THERE HAS BEEN NEWS REPORTS AFTER NEWS REPORTS ABOUT NEW PROBLEMS AT EDT. RECENT ARTICLES REPORT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FRAUD THAT COULD TOTAL THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS A CRISIS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS WRITTEN MULTIPLE LETTERS TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND VARIOUS OFFICIALS WITHIN HIS ADMINISTRATION. TO MEANINGFULLY FIX THE PROBLEMS AT EDT. BUT REAL ACTION HAS NOT YET OCCURRED. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO FAIL AT ITS PRIMARY MISSION. WE NEED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF YOU I BENEFITS WITH EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND MINIMAL FRAUD AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. THIS IS WHY I ALONG WITH MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES LET A BI PARTISAN CALL TO REQUEST AT THIS HEARING BE CONVENED AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDIT. ARE IMPLEMENTED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU TO THE LEADERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR RESPONDING TO OUR CALL. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE STATE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM FOR THE GOOD WORK ON THESE REPORTS. THEY HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO SHED THE LIGHT ON THE ISSUES AND OFFER REAL SOLUTIONS. IN THIS HEARING I ASK ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS TO GIVE AN HONEST ACCOUNT OF THE ISSUES AT THE E. D. AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SOLVE THEM. I'M SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHY THE AUDITORS PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT THESE CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED NOW TO TAKE CARE OF CALIFORNIANS AND TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. OUR CONSTITUENTS CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW WE WILL- BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. THE STATE AUDITOR PLEASE PRESENT. MORNING MEMBERS THIS IS THE LINE HOW ALL CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. THE RISE- CABALLERO AND CORTESE AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING MYSELF AND MY STAFF TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE TWO ARTISTS WE ISSUED ON THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY- WE DID SEND- THE COMMITTEES THREE DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS. ARE THE FIRST DOCUMENT IS A SUMMARY AND SOME GRAPHICS FROM OUR FIRST THOUGHT IT THAT WE ISSUED ABOUT CLAIMS PROCESSING AND FOCUSING ON THE CALL CENTER AT CENTER THE SECOND DOCUMENT IS ABOUT THE SECOND REPORT WHICH REALLY DID FOCUS ON- FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS- BY E. D. D. THE THIRD DOCUMENT IS. A DOCUMENT WHERE WE BROUGHT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TWO REPORTS TOGETHER INTO ONE DOCUMENT SO IT WOULD BE EASIER NOT ONLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS WE MAY D. ET DEET BY SUBJECT AREA BY CLAIMS PROCESSING BY CALL CENTER AT SENTARA. AND MANAGE LAYING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OUT BASICALLY CHRONOLOGICALLY BECAUSE IN MANY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS NOW WE PUT A SPECIFIC TIMELINE- OR GIVE A SPECIFIC MILESTONE THAT WE'RE EXPECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT THAT RESPECTIVE RECOMMENDATION SO THERE'S THREE DOCUMENTS I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING JUST FROM THE FIRST PAGE OF EACH DOCUMENT. THE FIRST PAGE OF THE DOCUMENT THREE RELATED TO THE AUDIT REPORTS ARE ESSENTIALLY SUMMARIZING THE KEY ISSUES WE HAD IN EACH OF THOSE TWO AUDITS AND THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALL STEP YOU THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS MISTER HARRIS IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE WHEN WE GET TO THE BACK Q. NA ALSO YOU PROBABLY SEE AYE HEATHER KENDRICK ON THE SCREEN. HEATHERS ARE ASSOCIATE CHIEF COUNSEL SHE WAS THE ATTORNEY ASSIGNED TO THIS ON IT ALSO SHE'S AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE IF THERE ARE ANY. SO WITHOUT MEMBERS ALL START WITH THE FIRST REPORT THE FIRST REPORT HAD FOUR KEY ISSUES FIRST OF ALL EDT NOT BEING PREPARED FOR A. DOWNTURN NOW THE PANDEMIC'S SIR IS ON PRESS- BUT THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAD BEEN PER. FOR POTENTIAL RECESSION WE KNOW THAT RECESSIONS OCCUR EVERY FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX YEARS. WHEN WE ISSUED OUR AUDIT REPORT BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN WE LOOK AT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS WE LOOKED AT THEIR CALL CENTER. THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CONSTITUENTS AND AT THAT TIME IT WAS DEALING WITH A RECESSION. THAT CALIFORNIA WAS SUFFERING FROM- SO WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO EDT FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING IMPROVING THEIR CALL CENTER IMPROVING THEIR PHONE SYSTEM TO ALLOW. A CERTAIN AMOUNT MESSAGES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REACH TO EDT OR REACH INFORMATION WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO TALK TO AN AGENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY ET HADN'T PUT TOGETHER THEY HAD STARTED WORKING ON A RECESSION PLAN BUT THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THAT PLAN WHEN THE WHEN THE PANDEMIC CARE. AND ESSENTIALLY THEIR DRAFT PLAN WAS WAS. PUT ON THE SHELF BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REALLY DEAL WITH THE SURGE OF CLAIMS THAT CAME IN. EARLY TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR FIRST CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS AUDIT THESE ARE ISSUES THAT EDT HAS KNOWN ABOUT HAS KNOWN ABOUT FOR QUITE A LONG TIME- AND HASN'T MADE ENOUGH PROGRESS. SO THAT IF SOME OF THOSE. MESSAGES IN THEIR THEY'RE- CLAIMS PROCESS THEIR CALL CENTER HD IMPROVED AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE MITIGATED SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN HAVING. IN AND REACHING OUT TO EDTA GETTING THEIR CLAIMS. CERTIFIED AND BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE BENEFITS SO WE'RE NOT SAYING IT WOULD HAVE FIXED EVERYTHING THE PANDEMIC AS WE ALL KNOW IS UNPRECEDENTED BUT CERTAINLY IF THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR PROCESSES. THIS IS AND DIFFICULTIES THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN FACING THIS LAST YEAR WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS SEVERE- SO THAT WAS THE FIRST KEY AREA THE SECOND HERE IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE CALL CENTER NOW EDT HAS STRUGGLED WITH THEIR CALL CENTER FOR YEARS. EVEN PREVIOUS TO THE PANDEMIC IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GET THROUGH TO AN AGENT WHO CAN ASSIST THEM OVER THE PHONE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE IN THE PAST- WERE TO TRAIN THOSE AGENTS MORE QUICKLY BACK WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT TEN YEARS AGO- IT TOOK ABOUT THIRTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN. TRAIN SOMEONE THEY STREAMLINE STREAMLINE THAT DOWN TO ABOUT NINE MONTHS UNDER THE PANDEMIC BUT THAT'S STILL A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU HIRE SOMEONE AND YOU NEED TO TRAIN THEM FOR NINE MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAN BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND ASSISTING. OUR CALLERS THAT GET IN. BUT THE BIG ISSUE WITH THE CALL CENTERS PEOPLE EVEN BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO AN INDIVIDUAL TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE- AND AN EDT HAD NOT. IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT SOME OF WHICH WE DISCUSSED IN OUR IN OUR PREVIOUS AUDIT BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH IS. YOU KNOW TRACK THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE GETTING FROM CALLERS ARE YOU CAN USE THAT INFORMATION FOR TWO PARTICULAR PURPOSES ONE IS TO TRAIN YOUR AGENTS ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT ALSO PERHAPS PUTTING TOGETHER A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION- SEGMENT ON YOUR WEBSITE SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD GO TO THE WEBSITE RATHER THAN HAVING TO TRY TO GET INTO THE CALL CENTER THEY GET THEIR QUESTIONS. ANSWERED BY JUST GOING OUT TO THE WEBSITE ARE SEEING THE FAQS AND- THIS IS A QUESTION I HAVE HERE'S THE ANSWER I DON'T EVEN NEED TO TRY AND CALL SOMEONE SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THAT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE SUGGESTED YEARS AGO. EDT IS STILL NOT DOING THAT THEY'RE NOT TRACKING. WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING THEY'RE NOT TRACKING AND INDUSTRY INDUSTRY BEST. WHICH IS FIRST CALL RESOLUTION HOW OFTEN IS THAT AGENT'S ABLE TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION OR THE IN THE ISSUE THAT PARTICULAR CALLER HAS. SO THAT PERSON'S CLAIM CAN CONTINUE TO GET PROCESSED AND THEN EVENTUALLY THAT PERSON GETS THEIR BENEFITS. SO THAT'S AN INDUSTRY STANDARD THAT WE'RE STILL NOT SEEING EIGHTY D. ARE. THE THIRD AREA STRUGGLING TO PROCESS CLAIMS- MANY OF EDIE'S EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY- THEY STILL WERE USING A LOT OF MANUAL PROCESSES. NEARLY HALF OF THE CLAIMS THAT CAME IN FOR THE FIRST. SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS. HAD TO BE PROCESSED MANUALLY BECAUSE THEY GOT KICKED OUT THEY THEY WEREN'T DEALT WITH. WITHIN AUTOMATION AUTOMATED SYSTEM. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD TO. HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG TIME TO GET THOSE INITIAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ARE SO EDT NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT SOME AUTOMATION NOW ONE THING THEY DID DO. IN OCTOBER AFTER THE STRIKE TEAM CAME AND MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS DAY IMPLEMENTED ID ME. AND THAT WAS A HUGE HELP AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO AUTOMATE A LOT OF THOSE. CLAIMS AS FAR AS VERIFYING AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY AND MOVING THAT CLAIM FURTHER DOWN. THE PROCESS OF THOSE BENEFITS CAN GET PAID RELATIVELY QUICKLY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THE OTHER THING THEY DID IS THEY- THEY SUSPENDED SOME TECHNICAL THINGS. THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE NOW AS WE KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PASSED LEGISLATION THAT CARES ACT THAT PROVIDED DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. TO DIFFERENT CALIFORNIANS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF EMPLOYED. WELL ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS TYPICALLY INTRODUCED UNDER TRADITIONAL YOU WHY IS. EIGHTY NEEDS TO VERIFY THAT I AS AN EMPLOYEE HAVE EARN SUFFICIENT WAGES TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THAT ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T APPLY FOR A SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL YOU DON'T HAVE AN EMPLOYER TO VERIFY. THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL EARNED THOSE THOSE WAGES SO THAT THEY ARE THERE FOR. ELIGIBLE FOR YOU I BENEFITS SO SOMETHING'S WERE SUSPENDED NOW. EDT HAS TO DETERMINE ONCE WE GET PAST. THIS PANDEMIC. SOME OF THOSE. THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WAIVE ARE GONNA BE ELIMINATED SO THEY HAVE IDEA ME AND THAT'S SOMETHING MAYBE THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TO USE. AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT AS PART OF THEIR AUTOMATION BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO LIKE THE EXAMPLE I JUST GAVE. SO THEY'VE GOT A LOOK AT ALL THEIR PROCESSES AND SEE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN CAL PROCESS CLAIMS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE WE'RE GOING TO GET PAST THIS PANDEMIC. BUT WE WILL ENTER A RECESSION IN ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX YEARS- THAT'S THE TYPICAL CYCLE THAT WE SAW WHEN WE LOOK AT RESEARCH SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT EDT REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT IT TO ME IS A HUGE. IMPROVEMENT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS WITH WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS PROCESSING. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IN THIS REPAIRS FIRST REPORT WAS THEY MADE SOME DECISIONS. WITH RESPECT TO ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND THE BI WEEKLYCERTIFICATIONS ALEX PLAN A COUPLE OF THOSE THE FIRST ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS THAT DECISION WAS MADE. THAT LABOR WORKFORCE AGENCY SECRETARY WE NEED TO GET THESE THESE PEOPLE PAY QUICKLY SO LET'S JUST WAVE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. WELL THEY DID THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ALL THE WAY THROUGH I THINK SEPTEMBER OCTOBER- AND THEN THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAME AWARE OF THAT HAVE CONCERNS. SAID YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT YOU NEED TO GO BACK NOW AND RECERTIFY ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU DID NOT ON THAT ESSENTIALLY YOU WAVE THEY THEN THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. THAT'S ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED ABOUT TWELVE MILLION ISSUE SO THERE'S- MILLIONS OF HOURS THAT EDT IS GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST. IN WORKING WITH THOSE CLAIMANTS CAN NOW VERIFY THEIR ELIGIBILITY. AND IN SOME CASES SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY DEEP BE DEEMED AN ELIGIBLE AND BE NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THOSE BENEFITS BACK THAT THEY RECEIVED. SO THAT WAS. THE ISSUE RELATED TO SUSPENDING ELIGIBLE THE SECOND ISSUE- THAT I TALK ABOUT WAS THE SURF. UNDER TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IF I'M UNEMPLOYED EVERY TWO WEEKS I HAVE TO. INFORM ET I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A JOB I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A JOB- AND THEN EAT OKAY YOU CONTINUE T BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS. EDT ALSO SUSPENDED THAT REQUIREMENT SAYING YOU DON'T NEED TO SEND IN THOSE BI WEEKLY. CERTIFICATIONS THAT YOU ARE CONTINUING TO SEEK WORK- AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS. ARE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PAID OUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE I GAVE YOU. BUT AGAIN THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WE HAD AN EXAMPLE THE REPORT. MAY HAVE GOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF WORK AND WORKED A LITTLE. SOME PART TIME. EARNED SOME INCOME AND THEREFORE WEREN'T FULLY ELIGIBLE FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY WERE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE FROM E. D. NOW THEY MAY BE NOTIFIED BY A ET DE. WELL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP. FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO. RIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING EXAMPLE WE HAVE IN THE REPORT AS AN INDIVIDUAL IS EMPLOYEE GETS PART TIME EMPLOYMENT. EARN SOME INCOME REPORTED TO EDT BUT BECAUSE HE HAD SUSPENDED THOSE THOSE CERTIFICATIONS THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION. SO THE CLAIMANT DID EVERYTHING RIGHT THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL WE USE IN THE REPORT BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE I'M SURE CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE WHO ARE IN THIS SITUATION. IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOW ARE HAVING TO WORK WITH THE D. D. YOU TRY TO PROVIDE THOSE BI WEEKLY THAT CERTIFICATIONS AND IN SOME CASES MAYBE. WE INFORMED THAT YOU GOT OVERPAID SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK. SO FOUR KEY ISSUES IN THE FIRST AUDIT REPORT THAT WE ISSUE. THE SECOND OUR REPORT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON FRAUD. DETECTION PREVENTION AND CETERA AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM EDT- YOU KNOW THEY HAD A- A PRESS CONFERENCE IN DISCLOSURE OF ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION OUR AUDIT REPORT TALKED ABOUT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. FROM MARCH THROUGH DECEMBER EDIE'S NUMBER WAS ARE CONTINUING ON INTO JANUARY. WE SEE IT. EXPLAINED THAT THESE ARE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT I THINK EDT CAN EXPLAIN I THINK THEY BELIEVE IT'S ALL FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS UP TO THE ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. WE SAID POTENTIALLY AT THIS POINT BECAUSE HE REALLY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO IN. AND PROCESS LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE CLAIMS THAT WERE PAID OUR EITHER UNDER AN UNCONFIRMED IDENTITY A SUSPICIOUS ADDRESS ARE THE EXAMPLES WE HAVE IN THE AUDIT REPORT- SO WE DON'T KNOW WE CERTAINLY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT WE FELT THAT THAT NUMBER WOULD GROW AFTER WE ISSUED OUR RIGHT ARE COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK IN DECEMBER AND THEN ISSUED A REPORT IN JANUARY. AND CERTAINLY EDT HAS COME UP WITH A MORE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HIGHER NUMBER THAN THAN WE HAD IN OUR REPORT WHICH DOESN'T SURPRISE US- BECAUSE I THINK THE KEY ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT. UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES- WELL AWARE OF THE SIX. WHERE MY- MAILINGS GOING TO SUSPEND ADDRESSES SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING TWENTY THIRTY- EDT CORRESPONDENTS IN THE MAIL AND NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVE AT THIS ADRESS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THIS GET BACK TO EDT SUCKS ET DIDN'T SUSPEND OR TAKE ACTION. UNTIL FAIRLY FAR INTO THE- PANDEMIC THEIR FIRST. ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PREVENT FRAUD WAS IN JULY AND THAT WAS THE SUSPICIOUS IDENTITIES AND- UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES AND THEY PUT SOME STOP PAYMENT. CONTROLS AND THEN IT WASN'T UNTIL SEPTEMBER- WHERE THEY STARTED HOUSE STOPPING PAYMENTS OUT TO SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES WHERE MULTIPLE- CLAIM INFORMATION OR CLAIM. BENEFITS FOR BEING SENT TO THE SAME ADDRESS OR AN ADDRESS IT SEEMS VERY SUSPICIOUS. SO THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE. IN THE FRAUD REPORT THE SECOND ISSUE WAS A COUPLE OF HIGH PROFILE SITUATIONS THAT EDT WAS NOT PREPARED FOR- AND DIDN'T HANDLE AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST IS RELATED TO THE FROZEN ACCOUNTS WORKING WITH BANK OF AMERICA. AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BANK OF AMERICA AND ET DE- BUT EDT DIRECTED BANK OF AMERICA TO FREEZE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. NOW THERE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF COMMUNICATION IN COORDINATION WITH WOULD BE A NAY IT WASN'T AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THE AND THE KEY ISSUE THAT WE REALLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH. OUR IS WHEN HE DIRECTED BANK OF AMERICA TO FREEZE THOSE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS IT DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN OR A METHOD OR APPROACH IT WAS GOING TO USE TO ASSESS ALL OF THOSE ACCOUNTS AND DETERMINE WHICH ONES WERE REALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS.% AND UNFREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND WHEN WE COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK IN DECEMBER WE HAD DETERMINED THAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED OUT OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. HAVE BEEN UNFROZEN SO THEY WORK ATTENTIVELY A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. WITH FROZEN ACCOUNTS- THAT EDT HAD NOT REVIEWED AND HAD NOT INFORMED SB A- TO. UNFREEZE SO THOSE CLAIMANTS. STATEMENT COULD GAIN ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS. THE SECOND KEY ISSUE IS THE INCARCERATION DATA- THIS IS WHERE EDT WASN'T CROSS MATCHING. OUR CLAIMS COMING IN WITH INCARCERATION DATA FROM CDC ARE AND CERTAINLY FROM OUT LOCAL. INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR POTENTIALLY INCARCERATED OUT OF STATE. SO WE DIDN'T SEE THAT CROSS MATCHING EVEN THOUGH WHEN WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE SAW THAT BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE STATES DOING THIS TYPE OF CROSS MATCHING AND IT'S A VERY VALUABLE TOOL. ON TO PREVENT FRAUD. EDT WASN'T DOING THAT- AND WHEN THEY DECIDED THEY WANT TO DO NEEDED TO DO THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IF YOU LOOK ISSUED A LETTER. SAYING THERE ARE MILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS POTENTIALLY- GOING OUT TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS OR ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPANDING CAR STRAIGHT INDIVIDUALS AND CARCERI INDIVIDUALS IDENTITY MAY HAVE BEEN STOLEN. OR IT MAY BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS SEEKING AND ULTIMATELY ABLE TO GET BENEFITS- WE LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO PUT TOGETHER THEIR ESTIMATES ONCE THEY WERE ABLE TO START CROSS MATCHING AND THE REASON THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO. IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD TO STEP IN AND ESSENTIALLY AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO SHARE INCARCERATION DATA INFORMATION I NEEDED HE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CROSS MATCHING. THE OTHER STEP THAT HE TOOK WAS THEY ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE VENDOR WHO HAD ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND CERTAINLY OUT OF STATE. SO THAT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN IT CAME LATE IN THE PANDEMIC- IS SOMETHING THAT EDT HAS KNOWN ABOUT FOR A WHILE THEY HAD BEEN INFORMING THE LEGISLATURE OVERTIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT EDT WAS LOOKING TO DO- BUT NEVER REALLY MOVED FORWARD AND GOT IT DONE AND TILL LATE IN TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE INCARCERATION DATA FROM CDC ARE ENTERED INTO THAT CONTRACT AND THE ESTIMATES THEY GAVE US WHICH WE INCLUDING THE OUR REPORT WE LOOK AT THEIR ESTIMATES. ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. SO THAT THAT WAS THE SECOND KEY. ISSUE IN THE FRAUD AUDIT REPORT. THE THIRD KEY ISSUE JUST LOOK AT THIS. IN THE AND THE- HOW EASY IS COORDINATING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AS FAR AS PREVENTION DETECTION OF FRAUD. WE FOUND VERY DISJOINTED- SITUATION THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT UNITS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GRAPHIC IN THE PACKET THAT WE PULLED OUT OF THE ART REPORT. NOT EXPECTING YOU TO LOOK AT IT BUT IT SHOWS. FOR FIVE DIFFERENT UNITS IN SOME UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING IDENTIFYING SUSPICIOUS CLAIMS FRAUDULENT POTENTIALLY FRAUGHT THEN THEY HAVE TO NOTIFY A DIFFERENT UNIT WE NEED TO STOP PAYMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR CLAIM. AND THERE WASN'T A LOT OF COLLABORATION COORDINATION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO BE ABLE TO FOR ET DE TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE AND MAKE SURE OUR OUR FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS WORKING EFFICIENTLY. BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS SO WE FEEL THEY NEED TO HAVE ESSENTIAL IN UMBRELLA UNIT A UNIT THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ALL THE DIFFERENT. ACTIVITIES OF THESE DIFFERENT UNITS WITHIN EIGHTY DAYS VERY DISJOINTED. THE OTHER THING THAT WE- TALK ABOUT IN THAT SECTION OF THE REPORT IS EDT NOT NECESSARILY ASSESSING THE AFFECTED EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS AND DETECTION TOOLS. NOW THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ABOUT FRAUD. BUT NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO ANALYZE THEIR TOOLS AND THEN REPORT OUT HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE TOOLS HAVE BEEN IN DETECTING AND PREVENTING FRAUD. SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT BUT THAT WAS THE THIRD KEY ISSUE IN THE AUDIT REPORT THE SECOND ON A REPORT HAT WE ISSUE RELATED TO. FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION. SO NOW MEMBERS I'LL TAKE YOU TO THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE FELT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS I INDICATED EARLIER IN MY PRESENTATION. WE IDENTIFIED BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN WE ISSUED OUR FIRST THOUGHT IT WE DID A FOLLOW UP ON IT NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE STILL SAW THERE WERE SOME. DIFFICULTIES THAT EDT WAS HAVING AND THEY WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME STATUTORY CHANGE AS CENTER NIELSEN AND I KNOW MANY OTHERS HAVE EMBRACED THERE'S A LOT OF- LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED WELL LET ME STEP YOU THROUGH OUR KEY LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHAT SUBJECT MATTER THEY TIED TO. SO THE FIRST SET OF LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TIED TO. THE RECESSION PLANNING SO EDT NEEDS TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION PLAN AS I SAID. WE THE RESEARCH WE LOOKED AT SAYS IT RECESSION OCCURS EVERY FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX YEARS SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO- WITH REGARD TO STAFFING WITH REGARD TO SOME OF OUR PROCESSES. SO THAT WE CAN QUICKLY ADJUST TO A SURGEON CLAIMS WHEN WE ARE STARTING TO- EXPERIENCE A RECESSION IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY NEED TO HAVE THIS RECESSION PLAN IN PLACE SO THEY CAN PUT IT. PUT IT IN ACTION WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO RESEARCH- AND UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE BEING ON A AND- SAME THING IN DEALING WITH STAFFING ISSUES PROCESSES ETCETERA WE THINK THAT RECESSION PLAN NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE. WITHIN A YEAR OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE PASSING LEGISLATION IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNING IT AND THAT BILL BEING ENACTED INTO LAW. WHAT WE'RE GIVING EIGHTY TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THAT TO GET THAT RECESSION PLAN IN PLACE. THEN WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING SHOULD ALSO BE IN STATUTE IS EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER THEY NEED TO REASSESS THAT PLAN AND DETERMINE WHETHER NEED THEY NEED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PLAN. IT REALLY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EIGHTY TO HAVE THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE- THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING LEGISLATURE REQUIRE EDT TO DO THIS IS REGARDING OVERPAYMENTS SO REQUIRE EDT TO POST ON ITS WEBSITE EVERY SIX MONTHS. OUR INFORMATION RELATED TO OVERPAYMENTS HOW MANY OVERPAYMENTS HAVE THEY IDENTIFIED HOW MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS HAVE THEY NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OVERPAID AND THEY HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY BACK. HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE THEY RECOVERED FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THEY WAIVED ANY OF THOSE OVERPAYMENTS THERE IS THE AUTHORITY. FOR EDT TO WAIVE OVERPAYMENTS I THINK IT'S ABOUT A TWO YEAR WINDOW. BUT THE CLAIMANT HAS TO SUBMIT A HARDSHIP CLAIM AND CURRENTLY IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT PROCESS IS A MANUAL PROCESS SO AGAIN. THIS WILL BE ADDED ON TO THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD. WHICH ALREADY IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MANAGE I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE L. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ISSUES FOR THOSE TOLD TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS AS FAR AS THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT WERE DEFERRED OR SUSPENDED. NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT. IN COMBINATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE. I'M SURE INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBMIT HARDSHIP CLAIMS SAYING I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THIS MONEY BACK I ACTED IN GOOD FAITH PLEASE WAIT THE BENEFITS SO WE'RE SUGGESTING IN OUR LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE EVERY SIX MONTHS. THE NEXT ISSUE IS LESSONS LEARNED THEY NEED TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP. TO REALLY REFLECT ON WHAT WORKS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT DID NOT WORK AND USE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AS IT BUILDS ITS RECESSION PLAN- SO THAT CALIFORNIANS DON'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN CLEARLY THE PANDEMIC'S UNPRECEDENTED. BUT AS I'VE BEEN SAYING RECESSIONS ARE NOT UNPRECEDENTED BAY COMMENTS THEY ARE CYCLICAL SO WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED MEMORIALIZED AND USED TO DEVELOP A BETTER ARE PLANNING IN THE FUTURE THAT RECESSION PLANNER REFERRED TO. THE NEXT ISSUES AGAIN ALL LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO CROSS MATCHING REQUIRING ET DE IN STATUTE TO CROSS MATCH AGAINST STATE OF CALIFORNIA CDCR INCARCERATION DATA AND THEN ALSO TO ACCESS IF THEY HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH A VENDOR. DO THAT ACCESS IN INCARCERATION DATA OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER STATES SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT CROSS MATCH THEY CAN PREVENT THOSE CLAIMS. FROM EVER BEING PAID THAT WILL BE A HUGE DETERRENT AND PREVENTION MEASURE FOR- THE DEPARTMENT AND FOR THE FUTURE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ABOUT IT'S FRAUD DETECTION EFFORTS HOW EFFECTIVE HAVE THEIR TOOLS BEEN ARE THEY USEFUL TOOLS AND WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION EDT YOU'VE GOT TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR TOOLS AND IF THERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP USING MOUSE BUT IF THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE LET'S CONTINUE TO USE THOSE AND BOLSTER THOSE TOOLS SO THAT WE PREVENT PAYMENTS FROM EVER GOING OUT THE DOOR ONTO A FRAUDULENT YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FILED A FRAUDULENT CLAIM- AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE. ANDIN THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS IS REQUIRE EDT BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEN BI ANNUALLY. AFTER THAT TOO AGAIN ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE TOOLS. AND REPORT THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT CALIFORNIANS KNOW THAT HE DOES HAVE GOOD STRONG TOOLS IN PLACE NOW JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SEEMS LIKE A FOR A LONG WAYS OFF SO WHAT WE ARE INCLUDING IN THIS RECOMMENDATION IS THAT EDT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JULYOF THIS YEAR JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THEIR PROGRESS IN DETERMINING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ASSESS ALL OF THEIR TOOLS ARE AND HOW THEY WOULD ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE TOOLS WHAT WHAT MEANT METRICS THEY WILL USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TOOLS ARE EFFECTIVE AND AGAIN REPORTING THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JULY AS FAR AS THEIR PROGRESS. IN COMING UP WITH WAYS TO DO THAT AND THEN BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO HAVE THAT IN PLACE AND THEN EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THAT REASSESSED THOSE TOOLS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE CONTINUING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND IF THEY'RE NOT LET'S STOP USING THOSE TOOLS THOSE ARE ALL OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS- TO THE LEGISLATURE WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ET DE. I WASN'T GOING TO GO THROUGH THOSE IN DETAIL BUT WE DO HAVE IN YOUR PACKET IT'S THE THIRD DOCUMENT- WHICH WE BROUGHT AGAIN ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER- THEY ARE LAID OUT BY SUBJECT AREA AND THEY ARE ALSO AS I SAID LAID OUT BY THERE ARE CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING EDT IMPLEMENT AND MEDIALLY WORKING WOULD BE A VERY FOR EXAMPLE TO GET A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF THESE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN FROZEN I NEGLECTED TO MENTION THAT EARLIER ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE BUT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE. A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OF THE ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN FROZEN ARE SO THAT THEY CAN GO THROUGH AND IDENTIFY EACH OF THOSE TAKE A LOOK AT THEM AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME OF THESE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WHOSE ACCOUNTS ARE FROZEN UNFROZEN SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS LIKE THAT THAT WE THINK YOU NEED HE NEEDS TO DO IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE EXPECT EDT TO GET DONE BY MARCH BY JULY AND BY THE BY LATER IN THE YEAR WE TRY TO INCLUDE AS- MANY. THOSE IN CURRENT LEGISLATIVE YEAR I KNOW MEMBERS ARE HERE UNTIL. THE SECOND WEEK OF SEPTEMBER SO WE FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU NEED TO GET A LOT OF THESE. NOT JUST TO REPORT THE LEGISLATURE BUT FOR CALIFORNIANS GET THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT IN PROCESSING CLAIMS HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING CALL CENTERS MAKING SURE WE'RE PREVENTING FRAUD. ALL OF THAT GETS DONE AS QUICKLY AND AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR- I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR I KNOW YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THAT. YOU WERE GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL ALL OF THE PANELS. HAD HAD THEIR- OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THAT COMPLETES MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THE PRESENTATION ON STATE AUDITOR- WE AS I SAID EARLIER WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THESE PANELS FIRST AND THEN WE WILL OPEN UP FOR. QUESTIONS SENATOR DOLLY I KNOW YOU HAD A QUESTION- LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS. DIRECTOR SIGNS FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. WELL KARTUZY AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WILL READ A SCIENCE THE NEWLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF EDG. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENT I WELCOME THIS YEAR. WITH ME. ARE THE NEWLY- ALSO APPOINTED ET DE EXECUTIVES NANCY FARIAS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR POLICY LEGISLATION AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. CAROL WILLIAMS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND KEVIN MATURE. DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AFTER THE PANEL OF WAR AS WAS MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE PANELS I WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS TODAY WILL BE SURE TO GET THEM TO YOU AND THE PUBLIC. FIRST I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MY BACKGROUND. I STARTED AT THE DEPARTMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR I HAVE FORTY YEARS OF EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ELEVEN YEARS EXPERIENCE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH CALL CENTERS. THIS IS THE FOURTH DEPARTMENT IN WHICH I WILL HAVE SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. IN THIS FIRST MONTH I HAVE SEEN BUT OUR CHALLENGES ARE AND THEY ARE MANY. BUT I'VE SEEN SUCH CHALLENGES IN MY FORTY YEARS AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOLUTIONS. TO THESE PROBLEMS. BEFORE ADDRESS LAUDED FINDINGS I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY ABOUT FRIDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT RELATED TO EDIE'S ROLLOUT OF THE NEXT PHASE OF FEDERAL EXTENSIONS. AS YOU KNOW THE CARES ACT EXTENSIONS ENDED DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH LAST YEAR. NEW FEDERAL EXTENSIONS WERE SIGNED INTO LAW ONLY AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. STARTING IN EARLY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE EDT BEGAN PROCESSING CLAIMS AGAIN FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO BEGIN PROVIDING. PEOPLE THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK. WE WORKED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE INSTITUTE THE NEW EXTENSIONS AND I'M GLAD TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THREE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. TO THE EXTENSION FOR FEDERAL BENEFITS INCLUDING THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE AND ENDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION RECIPIENTS WHO HAD AN EXISTING TAKE CLAIM AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY SIX. WE ARE UPDATING OUR SYSTEMS ELIGIBILITY RULES TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE NEXT PHASE OF EXTENSION BENEFITS FOR ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR. THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHOSE FEDERAL CLAIMS WERE EXHAUSTED BEFORE THE CARERS ACT EXPIRED IN DECEMBER. IN OTHER WORDS THERE WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AND OUR SYSTEM NEEDS UPDATING TO ACCEPT CLAIMS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD EXHAUSTED THEIR ELIGIBILITY. BY MARCH SEVENTH THESE CLAIMS WILL BE ABLE TO CERTIFY THEIR ELIGIBILITY EDT WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY. SO PROCESS THEIR CLAIMS. SO THIS WEEK WE BEGAN CONTACTING INDIVIDUALS WHO CLAIM BENEFITS CLAIM FEDERAL BENEFITS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CERTIFY THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE. IN MARCH SEVENTH HE DID NOT PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION IN DURING THE HEARINGS ON FEBRUARY FIRST AND THIRD BECAUSE THE DECISIONS RELATED TO THE PROCESS WOULD NOT MEET UNTIL. JUST LAST WEEK. ONCE THE DECISIONS WERE FIRM ON FRIDAY WE INFORMED THE LEGISLATURE DURING A REGULARLY SCHEDULED A SCHEDULED CALL AND THEN THE NEWS MEDIA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME IS TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY WITH ACCURACY. I APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATORS NEED TO KNOW. WHEN THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US UP FOR LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WHO ARE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. I THANK YOU FOR ASSISTING US IN GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT. NOW TURNING BACK TO THE ARTISTS WHO USE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. WE AGREE WITH EACH OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL ARE ALREADY MAKING CHANGES TO OUR SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. PROVING OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT THE FIRST SLIDE A FRONT FACING OUR SYSTEM. I KNOW THAT WE CAN RECORD THIS WEEK AS WE RECOMMEND THESE AS WE IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE WILL FIND SOLUTIONS. TO THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT ON BY THIS ONCE IN A LIFE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC RECESSION IT HAS COST. IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION. WE INTEND TO IDENTIFY MANY ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS AND WE WILL CREATE SOLUTIONS AS WE PROGRESS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON ACTION TRENCHING BY TWO PRIMARY GOALS GET EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE INTO THE HANDS OF ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. AND STOP FRONT BEFORE IT ENTERS THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE FIVE KEY STRATEGIES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ONE IMPROVE EDIE'S OPERATION AND GOVERNANCE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET OUR PRIMARY GOALS. INCLUDING OPERATIONS AND GOVERNANCE INCLUDES UPGRADING THE COST INTEREST ABILITY TO DELIVER RESPONSIVE EFFICIENT SERVICE. ACTING IMPROVED STAFF TRAINING AND EXPANDING LANGUAGE ACCESS TO BE REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS. WE ARE INCREASING COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE STATUS OF CLAIMS IN PROCESS AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT WILL AFFECT THE CLIENT EXPERIENCE. ONE ACTION TO GO ALREADY TAKEN MISTER CREATION OF THE CURRENT CENTER DIVISION. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FRENCH THIS COMMAND CENTER WILL MANAGE CALL CENTER RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO A GROUP CALL CENTER OPERATIONS. WE MUST UPGRADE THE CALL CENTERS ABILITY TO DELIVER RESPONSIVE EFFICIENT SERVICE SO THAT CALLS ARE RESOLVED AFTER ONLY A SINGLE CONTACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WE WILL ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR TRACKING AND ANALYZING THE REASONS WHY YOU WHY CLAIMS CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE COMING I NEED TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BETWEEN MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL DEVELOP THE TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO COLLECT FIRST CALL RESOLUTION DATA. USING THIS DATA BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVE THE CALL CENTER HAS BECOME IN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO CALLERS. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE WE ARE NOT READY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS UNTIL THAT TIME. WE ARE HIRING MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED STAFF THIS MONTH. THE STAFF MUST BE TRAINED ON DOL'S NVDS COMPLEX RULES. BUT THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM A NEW KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW USING. THIS TOOL PROVIDES SECTIONS FROM THE TRAINING MANUAL IN SEARCHABLE IN SEARCHABLE DATABASES TRAINING ARTICLES AND YOU AYE PROGRAMMERS. ALL OF THE STAFF WILL BE USING KEYWORD SEARCHES IN THE TOOL FOR FINDING INFORMATION TAKEN. EIGHT TO THE CUSTOMER ABOUT A SPECIFIC QUESTION. THIS IS. THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A TOOL. TO PROVIDE THESE KINDS OF CANCERS IS A STANDARD INDUSTRY- PROCEDURE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE USING IT YOU'RE A FEW EXAMPLES OF PLANNED ACTION TO JUST THIS IS JUST A FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO COMBAT OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD. SECOND TO IMPROVE COMMUNITIES ABILITY TO MAKE TIMEY DECISIONS ABOUT POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND CONTINUALLY FIND WAYS TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT FRAUD. EDT HAS FACED NEW LEVELS OF FRAUD AND CRIMINAL ATTACKS TO OUR SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THE PAST. YOU AYE SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY WERE TARGETING OKAY NICE CRYING IMMEDIATELY WAS NO EXCEPTION. HOWEVER WE MUST INSURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMS AT ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS WHAT WE WORK TO PREVENT FRAUD. WE MUST ACT QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS SO LEGITIMATE CLAIMS GET THEIR BENEFITS FASTER WE ARE NOW REVIEWING OUR FRAUD FILTERS AS WAS SUGGESTED TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. I WANT TO PUT A PERSONAL NOTE HERE. I TOO AM GETTING LETTERS AND EMAILS AND CALLS. FROM CLAIMANTS WHO ARE FRUSTRATED. I GREW UP IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. I KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE THEY WERE MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. I HAVE. AS MUCH. RIGHT TO HELP THESE PEOPLE OUT AS ANYBODY. IN THIS HEARING. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO I KNOW. AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME. WE ARE ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH TOP INDUSTRY SECURITY CONSULTANTS TO CREATE NEW WAYS TO STAY AHEAD OF SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE WE RECENTLY CONTRACTED WITH AN ECCENTRIC EVALUATE OUR FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE WORK OF ID ME AT TIMES AND WRITERS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE FRAUD OR TAX EXT THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND LEANED THE WAY. TO PREVENTING ID THEFT AND ONLINE UNEMPLOYMENT TRY. THREE HE DECIDED TO CREATE A TECHNOLOGY. WE MUST CREATE A SYSTEM THAT CAN RESPOND TO TODAY'S NEEDS AND TOMORROW'S NEEDS. A COMPLETE OVERHAUL IS GOING TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MONEY TIME AND STAFF TRAINING. AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE EDT STRIKE TEAM IN IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. ARE PROJECT BENEFITS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION WAS PASSED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. ONE CRITICAL REASON THAT THIS STEP WAS TAKEN WAS TO ENSURE THAT INEFFICIENT BUSINESS PROCESSES IDENTIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE NEW PLATFORM. INSTEAD WE WILL REVIEW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND PRIORITIZE THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE RESTARTING OUR BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT. THE TERM GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT- WE'LL REVIEW IN ALL OF OUR PROCESSES. BUSINESS PROCESS- CREATED DATE AND AT A CERTAIN DATE AND TIME TO ADDRESS CURRENT ISSUES. OUR ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN IN THE PAST AND WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES. WELL THIS TECHNOLOGY SPREADING- AND IMPLEMENTING HOWEVER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS OPTIONS. BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL IDENTIFY IMPROVEMENTS IN CLAIMS PROCESSING. PAYMENTS WE WILL IMPLEMENT SECTOR SOLUTION. IN THE CURRENT- MOST RECENT APPROACH WHICH IS A MODULAR- MODULAR APPROACHES AND WILL PRIORITIZE THE BENEFITS TO OUR CLIENTS THE CLAIMS ARE FIRST. NUMBER FOUR COORDINATE WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHER STATES TO IDENTIFY AND STOP THE FRAUD IN THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FRAUD THANK YOU DEAN D. EXPERIENCED. 95% AS BEING IN FEDERAL GIMMICK UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE SELF EMPLOYED. BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVELIHOODS DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR WHOM THE STATE UNEMPLOYMENT AGENCIES DID NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE RECORDS IT DID NOT CONTAIN CONTAIN THE SAFEGUARDS THAT REGULARLY WHITE HOUSE. WELL BARRIERS TO ENTRY. KERN SELF CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND RELATIVELY HIGH PAYOUTS MADE IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUD. ORGANIZED CRIME CONTINUES TO ATTACK THE P. WORD PROGRAM AND IS CONSTANTLY ADAPTING TO FRAUD PREVENTION EFFORTS. ADDRESSING THIS IN A STATE BY STATE APPROACH IS NOT GOING TO PRODUCE THE RESULTS THAT A NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LAND EFFORT CAN. EDT CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORKFORCE AGENCIES AS WELL. AND TO HEAR FROM OTHER STATES THE BEST PRACTICES BEING USED TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING THE Y. AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE STOCK PRICE. GIVEN THE NATIONAL SCOPE OF IMPOSTOR FRAUD SCHEMES WE AND OTHERS HAVE CALLED ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. TO ENHANCE THE COORDINATION TO STOP THE EFFORTS OF SOPHISTICATED FRAUD SCHEMES BEFORE THEY SPREAD FROM STATE TO STATE. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANKFUL TO LEADERS LIKE SENATOR FEINSTEIN SENATOR BY THE- SPEAKER PELOSI FOR CALLING FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT. FOR THE STATE'S TO FIGHTING RIGHT IN MY FRONT. THIS COORDINATED RESPONSE WILL IMPROVE EACH STATE ABILITY TO FIGHT CRIME. ACCORDING TO YOUR RESPONSE IS CRITICAL AND SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S LEADERSHIP. WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. FINALLY NUMBER FIVE. PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO HOLD EDT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDIT REPORTS MEGACENTRE BRAND TAKES AN ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS ANY DEPARTMENT MUST BUILD ACCOUNTABILITY INTO ITS OPERATIONS AND CULTURE. THIS STARTS WITH ME IT WAS TRANSFER SEAMLESSLY TO MONITOR SHIP AND FUTURE EDT ADMINISTRATIONS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE MISTAKES OF YEARS PAST. WE WILL USE THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG WITH THE STRIKING STREAM CONSTRUCTING RECOMMENDATIONS AS A BLUEPRINT FOR MOVING THE DEPARTMENT FORWARD. WE HAVE CREATED A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE TO MAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- MAKE TO MAKE SURE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR TIME LINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED. WE'VE BEEN USING THE STRIKE TEAM STEERING COMMITTEE WHICH MEETS WEEKLY. TO STRATEGIZE A DIRECT EFFORTS ON THE COMPLETION OF THE STRIKE TO CONSTRUCTING RECOMMENDATIONS. THE SAME APPROACH WILL BE USED TO COMPLETE THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO TRACK COMPLETE. FOR ALL EFFORTS. WE WILL FINALIZE PLANS TO ADDRESS THE OUTSTANDING DETERMINATION AN OVERPAYMENT LOCALS WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GETTING AN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS AND STOP RIGHT BEFORE INTERESTED SYSTEM. THESE FIVE HE SUPPORT STRATEGIES WILL PRODUCE SOME OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED EDG AND CARRY THEM INTO THE FUTURE. BEFORE I CONCLUDE I WANT TO THANK THE STATE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM FOR THE PROGRESSION PROFESSIONALS AND THEY BROUGHT THROUGHOUT THE AUDIT PROCESS. WE WILL WORK TO SEE THAT THE COMPLETION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTED IN MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTRAORDINARY STAFF AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHO CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AS THEY NAVIGATE THIS CHALLENGING TIME. I'M SO APPRECIATE. OF THEIR DEDICATION TO THEIR WORK ESPECIALLY AS THIS PANDEMIC HAS CONTINUED. BECAUSE CONTINUED ON AND CREATE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES IN THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OUR CUSTOMERS. I'D BE REMISS IF I DID NOT THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THEIR STAFF WHO HAD BEEN A CRITICAL PARTNER IN RESOLVING CONSTITUENT CLEAN ISSUES AND SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC. WITH THAT IN MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SIGNS. AND NOW WE MOVE TO OUR LAST PANEL- MISTER JOHN LAWLER FROM BANK OF AMERICA. MADAM CHAIR THAT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT FOR TO BE OF A- IF I IF I MAY ADDRESS ABOUT HALF OF THE BANK. I'M SORRY OKAY WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN. IT SAYS AMIT FROM BANK OF AMERICA I'LL BE READING A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE BANK. OKAY I'M SORRY COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT WHAT'S YOUR POSITION AT BANK OF AMERICA. YES I AM I AM I AM- AND HEAD OF GLOBAL TRANSACTION SERVICES WHICH IS THE UNIT OF THE BANK. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- WHOLESALE PAYMENTS AND LIQUIDITY FOR CORPORATIONS AND FOR- MUNICIPALS AND- GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. OKAY OKAY GO AHEAD MR MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE ASSEMBLED SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'M JOINED TODAY BY THE BY MY COLLEAGUE JOHN WALLER. THE LEADER MUNICIPAL FINANCE BUSINESS AND OVERSEES THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH EDT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO ABOUT HIS BILL BOX THE HEAD OF OUR GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRIMES COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL RISK TEAM. AND A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK. DURING OUR DISCUSSION WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO SUPPORT BDD POLITICALLY MEN'S. AND TO ADDRESS THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL FRAUD THE PROGRAM IS EXPERIENCING. BANK AMERICA'S BEEN THE PREPAID DEBIT CARD PROVIDER FOR THE STATE UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE WERE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE EDG TO DELIVER MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS TO QUALIFY CALIFORNIANS. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE HAD TO ENGAGE DIRECTOR SANDRA RETIREMENT OFFICE AND WITH OUR TEAM OVER THE PAST YEAR TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER WITH THE EIGHTY WE SHARE THE SAME OBJECTIVES. ENSURING THAT A VALID CLAIM IS RECEIVED HIGHLY SUPPORT. AND MINIMIZING AND MITIGATING THE UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF CRIMINAL FRAUD WE ARE SEEING TO PROTECT THE PROGRAM. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AN IMPORTANT POINT. THE CRIMINAL FRAUD IN THIS PROGRAM IS NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR SEVERAL OTHER STATES AND BROUGHT IS CHALLENGING UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE SIZE AND SCALE OF THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ATTRACTED SUBSTANTIAL FRAUD. INCLUDING CRIMINALS WERE FRAUDULENTLY ATTEMPTING TO CLAIM BENEFITS. IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT THERE IS A SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL NETWORKS INVOLVED IN THIS HAS BEEN ASSESSED BY OTHER THIRD PARTY SPECIALISTS AS WELL. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE EIGHTY D. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE'VE ISSUED MORE THAN NINE MILLION DEBIT CARDS. INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION IN BENEFITS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE EDT. WE HAVE A THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ASSIGNED TO SUPPORT THE EDT. AND LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS AND BENEFICIARIES. IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT CHALLENGES THE PROGRAM WE'VE CREATED NEW PROCESSES FOR EXPEDITING HANDLING FOR CLAIMANTS AND SHARING INFORMATION WITH DDT AND THE RELEVANT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ABOUT FRAUD STRATEGIES. PART OF THE JOINT RESPONSE HAS BEEN FREEZING CARDS FOR THEIR CONCERNS THE LISTED CARDHOLDER WAS NOT ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AT ALL. I KNOW WE WILL DISCUSS THAT IN MORE DETAIL TODAY. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FROZEN ACCOUNTS REPRESENT FRAUD THAT WERE STOPPED REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OR MORE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY POTENTIALLY THE BILLIONS. WE HAVE A REGULAR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDT TO UNFREEZE ACCOUNTS WE CAN. LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEK WE ARE ACTIVELY DISCUSSING A NEW APPROACH TO INCREASING CARDS. OUR WORK ON THAT NEW APPROACH SHOULD BE COMPLETED VERY SOON. WE ARE HOPEFUL IT WILL BE MUCH FASTER AND WAS ABLE US TO UNFREEZE LEGITIMATE CARDS. EVEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR A CARDHOLDER TO CALL. THANK AMERICA'S TAKEN NUMBER OF STEPS ON ITS OWN. WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE FRAUD UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN STATUTES AND TO REPORT SUSPECTED CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. THE BANK HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN DOING SO. THROUGHOUT OUR FOCUS AT BANK OF AMERICA HAS BEEN SERVING THE LEGITIMATE UNEMPLOYED BENEFICIARIES AND MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF CRIMINAL FRAUD ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE. I KNOW WE SURE THAT BOGUS WITH EDT. AND WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED NOW WITH- QUESTIONS I WILL BEGIN WITH MY QUESTIONS CALL IN THE TWO CHAIRS AND THEN THE REST OF THE MEMBERS- I'M SORRY AND CENTER NIELSEN THAN THE REST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STARTING WITH MISTER DALI- GO. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ON THE STATE AUDITOR PLEASE. AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE- RECOMMENDATIONS IN GENERAL YOU MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE- AND WERE THERE ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE SO I JUST ALL THROUGHOUT TWO THREE. TWO CAN GET THE GIST OF WHAT WHERE I'M COMING FROM- YOU SAID THAT YOU DID THE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED IT MUST MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS- ADMINISTRATION. AND AGREE TO IMPLEMENT THE MALL BUT REALISTICALLY WHAT WILL- MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAPPEN WE DON'T WANT FROM TWENTY ELEVEN A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE SO- IT'S IMPORTANT AYE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE NEED TO HELP TO MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL SO WHAT WILL OF WHAT CAN YOU DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT D. D. D. AND THE LEGISLATURE WHAT'S THE MOST THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL- AND THEN JUST A FINAL SPECIFIC QUESTION IS- CAN YOU SHARE HOW EDT SHOULD ADDRESS THE STAFFING AND TRAINING TRAINING NEEDS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I MADE THE FIRST AFTER SOME OF THE ANSWERS BUT IT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT EDIE IMPLEMENT STAGE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MOST RECENT AUDITS- AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WE CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT WORK UNDER. THE LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVED A AN EMERGENCY AUDIT BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ASKS US TO WAIT UNTIL THE STRIKE TEAM WAS DONE WITH IT'S WORK WHICH WE DID AND THEN WE COMMENCED OUR WORK. BUT WE ALSO IDENTIFIED- KOVIN. FUNDS CARES ACT MONEY COMING INTO CALIFORNIA AS A HIGH RISK ISSUE SO WHAT THAT ALLOW MY OFFICE TO DO WAS TO ASSIGN ADDITIONAL STAFF TO THIS WORK SO THAT WE CAN DO. VERY BROAD ANALYSIS OF EDIE'S PROCESSES AND THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION EFFORTS THE REASON I'M MENTIONING THIS IS THE READ BECAUSE WE DID SOME OF THIS WORK UNDER OUR STATE HIGH RISK AUTHORITY. COMBINED INTO AUDITS- CERTAINLY AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT ON. BUT IT'S FROM DIFFERENT WITH IT VERY STRONG TEAM TOGETHER BECAUSE WE KNEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WORK. TYPICALLY WHEN AN ENTITY AN ODDITY REPOPULATE FIGHTS BACK TO MY OFFICE IT'S AT THE INITIAL AUDIT WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE IN THE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED THE TWO REPORTS. THAT WERE ISSUE IN LATE JANUARY THAT WOULD BE A SIXTY DAY WINDOW SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR. BECAUSE THIS IS- AS PART OF A STATE HIGH RISK- ISSUE. COMBINED WITH THE EMERGENCY AUDIT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR RESPONSES FROM EDT EVERY NINETY DAYS SO THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AS TO. HOW WELL EDT IS DOING AND IMPLEMENTING ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND THING IS AND MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS I MENTIONED- WE SAID YOU NEED TO DO THESE THINGS IMMEDIATELY LIKE WORKING WOULD BE A RADIO IDENTIFY THIS COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FROZEN ACCOUNTS COME UP WITH AN APPROACH AND NEATLY. AND STARK I'M FREEZING THESE ACCOUNTS HOPEFULLY LATER THIS MONTH- AND HOPEFULLY EDT AND- BANK OF AMERICA WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THAT. A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TODAY WE ALSO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO GET DONE BY MARCH THEY NEED TO GET DONE BY JUNE. SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IN REAL TIME INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT AS IT'S DOING TODAY AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND YES SPEEDY IS MAKING PROGRESS OR NO THEY'RE NOT- SO THAT WE AGAIN. YEAH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT HE PUT MORE PRESSURE ON UNITY LET'S GET SOME OF THESE THINGS IMPLEMENTED- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO THAT WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW DIRECTOR- AND WITH THE NEW. MANAGEMENT TEAM AT EDG BUT CERTAINLY WE NEED TO SEE SOME SOME CHANGE HAPPENING AT EDG WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TWENTY ELEVEN. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE MY STAFF DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER WE CAN GET THAT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. BUT CERTAINLY- WE FELT THAT SOME OF THEISSUES WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR REPORT BACK IN MARCH OF. TWENTY ELEVEN RELATED TO THE CALL CENTER RELATED CLAIMS PRESS ASSISTING. MANY OF THOSE RED. WERE TO. AT THEY DIDN'T GET A- THEY DIDN'T GET THE RECESSED PLAN IN PLACE EVEN THOUGH THEY STARTED WORKING ON ONE. SO THAT'S WHY WE FELT THERE WERE A LOT OF. THINGS THAT EDT NEEDS TO DO THAT WE FELT IT WAS REALLY INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THESE REQUIREMENTS IN STATUTE. SO THAT EDT UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS- AND IT ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT THAT ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW. DIRECTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THESE ELEMENTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A RECESSION PLAN. LET'S NOT KEEP TALKING ABOUT CROSS MATCHING WITH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH BEEN HEARING ABOUT THAT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. LET'S GET IT DONE WE WANT YOU TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE- ON HOW EFFECTIVE THAT CROSS MATCHING IS WORKING HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE TOOLS ARE WORKING THEIR REQUIRED CURRENTLY REPORTS YOU ANNUALLY. ON FRAUD AND WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED BUT NOT NECESSARILY ANALYTICS AS FAR AS- WHICH TOOLS ARE WORKING BEST. ARE THEY DOING ACROSS MANAGING HOW MUCH FRAUD HAS THAT PREVENTED. THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THESE TWO REPORTS ARE VERY STRONG. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE LEGISLATURE. INTRODUCING NUMEROUS BILLS WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS THOSE BILLS A LOT OF THOSE BILLS INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER AUDIT WE DID LAST YEAR ON. EDT AND ITS USE OF FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND DOCUMENTS- AS YOU MAY KNOW WE ISSUED A REPORT IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN ON THAT ISSUE WHERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER ASSEMBLYMEMBER GATO BACK IN THOSE DAYS HAD CONSTITUENTS SAYING I DON'T WANT MY FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON A DOCUMENT COMING TO ME BECAUSE OF THAT DOCUMENT ENDS UP GOING TO A DIFFERENT. LOCATION THAN MY IDENTITY IS POTENTIALLY STOLEN AS YOU SAR OR HEARD ABOUT IN OUR AUDIT REPORTS AND IT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS. NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS COMING OUT TO THE SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES OR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEVER FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE GETTING ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS AT THEIR PARTICULAR ADDRESS. IT'S REALLY INCUMBENT ON EDG TO GET THESE SSNS TRUNCATED OR TO USE A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IS ONE OF OUR RECOMENDATIONS I KNOW THERE'S LEGISLATION DIRECTED AT THAT BECAUSE- WE DID FOLLOW UP WORK ON THAT MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN NOT IT. IN LATER IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY WE SHOULD REPORT NOVEMBER AND FOUND THE THREE KEY DOCUMENTS THAT HAD. MILLIONS OF- MILLIONS GOING TO END OF. STILL HAD THOSE FULL SSNS WE IDENTIFIED TEN DOCUMENTS ANALYZE AND THREE OF THEM WAS THE LION SHARE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE GOING OUT SO IF THEY ADDRESS THOSE THREE. BE STRATEGIC EIGHTY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EDG TO GENDER STAND I THINK THEY DO THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND EATING NEEDS TO DO A RISK ASSESSMENT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE INVEST OUR RESOURCES WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA GET THE BEST. RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT AS FAR AS- FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS WERE THEIR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS WERE SUSPENDED YOU'VE GOT TWELVE MILLION ISSUES. YOU NEED TO DO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU DEEP DO A RISK ASSESSMENT. IT'S OUR ESTIMATE IS GOING TAKEN THREE MILLION HOURS TO GET THROUGH ALL THOSE TWELVE MILLION ISSUES THEY'RE GOING TO DO A RISK ASSESSMENT WHICH ONES OF THOSE ARE THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF CLAIMS TYPES OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY THAT RESULTED. IN A CLAIM BEING FRAUDULENT. DO THAT RISKS SO YOU INVESTING YOUR REESE. IN THE RIGHT PLACES AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO WITH THAT- CENTER THERE ARE SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THIS. RIGHT NOW BUT- I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS LIKE THE FUNDING. THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU TODAY AND THEN I'LL PASS IT ON.

THAT BASIS BE CALIFORNIA CONTRACT- APPROXIMATELY TWENTY PEOPLE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE. PROBABLY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW WORKING AT VARIOUS CALL CENTERS OR IN CLAIMS AND CLAIMS UNITS. FOCUSED ON THE- CALIFORNIA CONTRACTED ON. THE ISSUES WE ARE SEEING WITH THE EDT AND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE- THE STABBING WAS MADE WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT CLAIMANTS LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THEIR- THEIR CLAIMS REVISITED. AND UP- THEIR FUNDS WITH A RESTORED AND- USE OF THEIR CARDS ALLOWED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED WITH THE EDT WEEKLY- WE HAVE- AN EXCELLENT PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM ESPECIALLY WITH DIRECTOR SIGNS IT ARRIVAL- WE ARE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION A VARIETY OF TOPICS.

I WOULD RESPECT TO ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONTRACT- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE PROVIDE ANY ANSWERS TO WITH THE EDT IN A JOINT RESPONSE AS WE BELIEVE THAT LEAVES VOTE LEAST ROOM. FOR ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR ERRORS ARE ON THE CONTRACT WITH THE D. OKAY- JUST TO LET YOU THAT I HAVE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THE CONTRACT- REVENUES FROM THE FEES SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REPORT MONTHLY ON FEES EARNED. AN AVERAGE REVENUE HAVE YOU COMPLIED WITH THAT REQUIREMENT TO- AND- AGAIN MAKING A COPY OF A REQUEST TO SUBMIT A COPY OF THE CONTRACT. PROVIDED TO THIS COMMITTEE. OKAY SENATOR BETTER YET ALL IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- FIRST LET ME THANK GOD EVERYONE WHO'S TO STRIKE HERE TODAY- OBVIOUSLY ARE CRITICAL CONCERN IS HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD- AND WE APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE GOING FROM THREE. 3% UNEMPLOYMENT 216% THAT NO QUESTION THAT DAM THAT THAT'S WHAT CREATED THE CHALLENGE- BUT IT IS AN ISSUE OF HOW TO HOW DO WE GET OUT OF BED HOW DO WE- FIX THE SITUATION WHILE WE'RE FLYING THIS AIRPLANE SO LET ME START WITH THE- I THINK DIRECTOR SIGNS I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. ON LAND- AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE BANK OF AMERICA I RISK I RECALL HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT- EIGHT CONTRACT. IN THE FALL HAVING TO DO WITH THE CALL CENTER AND- THE EXTENSION OF A CONTRACT WITH THE LIGHT- AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE LIGHT WAS GOING TO BE HANDLING OUR CALL CENTERS. AND AND MIKE THE REASON I WAS CONCERNED AS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AS AS- AS MUCH AS WERE LETTING CONTRACTS GO. ON THAT- PROVIDE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IF WE'VE GOT AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF UP NEAR EMPLOYEES BUT- BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT CONTRACT AND HOW IT HELPED DDD TO SIGN IT BUT THE GREAT SURGE. IN CALLS AT THAT OUR OFFICES RECEIVED AND FRANKLY I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT OUR OFFICES BECAME THE CALL UNOFFICIAL CALL CENTERS- FOUR EDT THE GREAT SURGE HAPPENED IN THE FALL AS I AS I RECALL THERE THERE WERE. WAVES ON AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THAT CONTRACT WHAT DID WE GET FOR IT. THE ANSWER THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT I NEED TO PUT OF THE CALLS IN THE CALL CENTER INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE. INTO A CONTEXT. WE ARE RECEIVING THREE TO FOUR MILLION CALLS A WEEK. THERE IS NO WAY FOR MY EXPERIENCE WITH CALL CENTERS AT A CALL CENTER IS GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT TYPE OF VOLUME. IT NEEDS TO BE SUPPLEMENTED AS PARTNERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR BROUGHT UP. IMPROVED WEBSITE COMMUNICATION MORE COMMUNICATION FROM OF EDG SELF SERVICE OPTIONS WORKABLE SELF SERVICE OPTIONS. BECAUSE I WAS NOT HERE DURING THE EXTENSION OF THE JULY CONTRACT I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT TO ONE OF MY CHIEF DEPUTIES TO RESPOND. TO THANK YOU SENATOR CAROL WILLIAMS. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENSION OF THE CONTRACT PROVIDED AND HAS PROVIDED FROM A BELIEVE THE BEGINNING WHICH WAS THE FALL. AN AUGMENTATION OF FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES CLEARLY CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH AND THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE PUT AT THE FRONT END OF THE CONTACT CENTER TO ANSWER CALLS. DIRECT CLAIMANTS WERE TO GO HOW TO FILE CLAIMS AND THAT NATURE. THE OH MY GOODNESS OKAY JUST FORGOT THE QUESTION BUT THE- CONTRACT- THAT'S WHAT WAS THANK YOU THE CONTRACT PREVIOUSLY DID NOT EXCLUSIVELY SAY A CALIFORNIA BASED EMPLOYEES ONLY THIS EXTENSION THAT WE'RE IN NOW ABSOLUTELY DOES AND ANY CONTRACTS FORD WILL STIPULATE CALIFORNIA BASED EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU. SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE PURPOSE OF THE CALL CENTER WAS JUST BASICALLY DIRECT PEOPLE HAD IT FILE A CLEAN AND NOT NECESSARILY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THEY MAY HAVE IN REGARDS TO THE CLAIMS. MOST THANK YOU SENATOR CAROL WILLIAMS. THEY CERTAINLY. CAN TAKE THE CALL UP TO A POINT AND THIS ALLOWED US TO RESUME AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT- ASK EDT TO STOP HIRING BUT THE MOST EXPENSIVE- MOST A EXPERIENCE THE STAFF- ON THOSE PHONES INSTEAD OF HELPING NEW HIRES. IN TRAINING CLASSES AND THAT IS CERTAINLY EDT RESPONDED IN DOING SO BUT IT CREATED A GAP CREATED A GAP AND TALENT IN TRAINING RECRUITING AND HIRING AND- AS OF NOW WE HAVE FULLY- FULLY RESUMED ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS- ANTICIPATING. VACANCIES AND HIRING AND TRAINING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SPEAKING OF TRAINING- THAT MOST EXPERIENCE LEVELS THE EPR LEVEL OF OUR STAFF THAT BASICALLY CAN DO EVERYTHING AND IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THAT TRAINING WAS UPWARDS OF NINE ONE SIX MONTHS. IT HAS BEEN PARED DOWN NOW TO THIRTEEN WEEKS OF EXTENSIVE TRAINING THEY'RE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE TRAINING IN THIRTEEN WEEKS IMMEDIATELY BE OF HIGH VALUE TO CLIENTS AND CERTAINLY NATURALLY OVER TIME THERE IS CONTINUE TRAINING ON THE JOB KNOWLEDGE BUT- THAT WAS A STRONG STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATION THAT HAS PROVIDED. A GREAT BENEFITS AS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE. ONLY RISEN HIRING LATE OCTOBER NOVEMBER THOSE FOLKS ARE NOW ON THE PHONE AND AS DIRECTOR SCIENCE. EXPLAINED WE HAVE NINE HUNDRED FOLKS JOINING NOW THROUGH. MARCH. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO CLIENTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT RISK IN- THE OTHER THING THAT MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK. HELLO HOW TO MAKE THE SYSTEM SIMPLER. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND THAT'S THE REASON IT REQUIRES A THIRTEEN WEEK- BEFORE WITHIN NINE MONTHS A TRAINING PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OF THE SYSTEM BUT I. I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES FOR US TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THE AUDITOR. REPORTS THAT THE AUTOMATION RATE OF 90% WAS ACHIEVED- THE END OF NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THANKS TO THE AMPLE PIC IMPLEMENTATION TOOL CALLED I. DIED ME. AND DATA. MOSTRI CALLS THAT MY OFFICE RECEIVED IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS FROM CONSTITUENTS. WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE ID DOT ME A FREE FEATURE WITH THE NAY IT WAS UNABLE TO VERIFY. THE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR THERE WAS A NEED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY MORE THAN ONCE A DAY REPEATEDLY. BOB WHAT'S THE CURRENT AUTOMATION RATE AND THEN WHAT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT FUNCTIONING AS IT WAS. INTENDED AND IS THERE A SOLUTION FOR IT. OF CENTERS COVERING INTERNALLY START THE RESPONSE BY SAYING THAT WE ARE. CONTINUALLY REVIEWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH OF OUR CONTRACTORS. I AM IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEM AS SOON AS SAID CHIEF DEPUTY TWENTY FIRST. WHO IS A MONITORING. THE SITUATION ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HIRED ACCENTURE- BECAUSE WE WANT TO REVIEW. ALL OF OUR FRAUD MECHANISMS BECAUSE WE TO HAVE HEARD THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT WORKING FOR THE MOST PART- WE'RE REALLY CONCENTRATING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AND EDG. AND I KNOW THAT- SHOULD JEOPARDY VARIOUS HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE CEO OF I DO ME AND THEY'RE WORKING OUT SOLUTIONS THAT'S A. SENATOR NATIVE WITH EIGHTY DE- THAT THAT IS TRUE WE ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH ID ME- DATE I TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTOMATION RATE IS STILL AROUND NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NINETY IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT HAS- THAT HAS CHANGED MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN A GREAT PARTNER. FOR US- AS FAR AS IDENTITY VERIFICATION THERE IS IF THERE IS THERE IS- THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT- IT MANAGER IDENTITY VERIFICATION THE FIRST IS THAT IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM GOING TO THE WEBSITE ITSELF THERE IS A TRUSTED REFEREE. THAT IS AVAILABLE- THROUGH ID NEED A CURRENT WAIT TIME I JUST GOT THIS MORNING IS EIGHT MINUTES IT WAS LONGER- AT SOME POINT BUT THEY'VE HIRED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEY UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A LARGE URBAN POPULATION. TRYING TO GET THROUGH ON THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT IS THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH ID ME WE STILL DO HAVE OUR INTERNAL MANUAL PROCESS- AT EDT THAT THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE- CAN SEND CAN CERTAINLY GO THROUGH AND. AND DO GO THROUGH- AT- THIS IS DIRECTOR SIGNS. LET ME HOLES RISK. TO THAT. WE ARE NOT SATISFIED. THE QUALITY OF THE CALL CENTER SERVICES IN THEIR- MCCARTNEY THERE ARE THE CALL CENTER PEOPLE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO. RIGHT AT THE TOP HANDLED IF PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE CONTACT WITH US WE CONTINUE TO CALL YOU CAN BRING THEM OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING CALL THEY'RE DESPERATE. SO WE'RE WE'RE RE REVIEWING EACH OF THOSE BUSINESS PROCESSES TO ENSURE NOW AS SOON AS WE CAN SIMPLIFY THAT FOR THE CLEAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS THE BOMB. MY RESPONSE TO THE ID ME ISSUE IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S HAVING CHALLENGES WITH THE WITH THE PROGRAM- WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO SEND THEM TO A TO A ON AN ALERT SQUATTER WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL THEM SO THAT THEY CAN GET AN ANSWER AS TO EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IT'S KEEPING THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BE VERIFIED AS A- AS A VALID CLAIM AND- WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY JUST KEEP RECYCLING THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN THE SAME CALL THINGS GET TWELVE OR THIRTEEN. THOUSAND TIMES FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS WE GET IN OUR OFFICES AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE THAT 90% OR CLOSE TO IT IS REALLY GOOD BUT IT'S THOSE OTHER 10% THAT ARE HAVING PROBLEMS SEEM TO COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT'S HAPPENING AND BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM SOME HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE IT AND RESOLVE IT WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. CORPORATE THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR OF CALIFORNIA THANK THANK YOU AND THEN NOT COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR BE A BAY- AT THE CAN- WELL NUMBER ONE CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE EARNED PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTORS EDT FOR THIS THIS PAST YEAR. AND- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WHAT EXPENSES YOU'VE UNDERTAKEN THAT WERE UNANTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT BUT YOU DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED AND WHAT. WHAT THE COSTS HAVE BEEN. YES IT IS FENCED EVAN FOR THE BANK UP. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A FULL. FINANCIAL STABILITY I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THOSE NUMBERS TO YOU BY THE EDT I CAN TELL YOU THAT ARE- OVERALL THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING AT A NET LOSS POSITION TO ANSWER SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLION- FOR THE- FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THE MAJOR BEING ON ANTICIPATED STAFFING COSTS OF ADDING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO OUR CALL CENTERS AND TO OUR CLAIMS PROCESSING AND REVIEW UNITS SO WE HAVE JUST ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE. THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON THE CALIFORNIA CONTRACTOR THAT BUILT THOSE THOSE EXPENSES ARE NOT PASSED THROUGH TO THE KEY HERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE DID IT BECAUSE WE FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ON BEHALF OF THE PROGRAM IN THE STATE AND LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. WE ALSO WAIVE. THE WHOLE CATEGORY OF FEES STARTING LAST SUMMER TO ACTUALLY CARDS- AND- WE EXPANDED THAT THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. AGAIN BECAUSE WE FELT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THEN THE LAST. BUT NOT LEAST WE HAVE HAD AN EXPERIENCE- SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION OF FRAUD LOSSES DIRECTLY- FROM- A UNIQUE ELEMENT RELATED TO WITH THE DEBIT CARD OR PREPAID CARD PROGRAM. ASSOCIATED WITH- CLAIMS WHERE- CRIMINALS AND FRAUD AND CRIMINALS INTENT ON ON THE FRONT STAFF HAVE CALLED US CLAIMING TO BE LEGITIMATE RECIPIENTS OF CLAIMS OF A BENEFIT OF BENEFITS FROM THE STATE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE MADE. WHAT ARE CALLED PROVISIONAL PAYMENTS TO THESE CLAIMANTS UNDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WORLD GYM EQUIPMENT AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO THAT AS OF NOW TO RECOUP THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT SO OVERALL. THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING AT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS AGAIN WE DON'T MENTION THAT- UNLESS WE'RE SPECIFICALLY ASKED A DIRECT QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TODAY. AS WE DO FEEL THAT IT IS- IF IT DOES PALE COMPARED TO THE COST THE EPIDEMIC- FOR- FOR SUCCESSFUL FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER IF YOU COULD GET US A- RUNNING LIST MAYBE BY MONTH THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND- I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE THEIR BANK OF AMERICA HAS BEEN A PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK- TO THE BENEFIT. OF THE UNEMPLOYED AND SO- BUT THAT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE- WHAT THAT HAS COST YOU AS WELL AS WHAT IT'S ON EARNED YOU IN INCOME AND BY THE SAME TOKEN WHAT WHAT THE BENEFIT IS BEEN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL- IT APPEARS THE TV DOES NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FROZEN ACCOUNTS. SO I WANT TO ASK BANK OF AMERICA IF YOU HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST. NUMBER ONE AND ARE YOU WORKING PROACTIVELY ON THOSE ACCOUNTS TO DETERMINE WHICH ONES ARE LEGITIMATE. AND IF AND IF YOU ARE CAN YOU TELL US HOW MANY CLAIMS HAVE. BEEN LEGITIMIZED OFF THAT LIST. OKAY SERVICES. WE DO HAVE A LOOK AT THE- OF A COMPREHENSIVE LIST THAT WE DO- SHARE WITH AND RICK AND IN TURN RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM. THE EDT. IT IS CONSTANTLY MOVING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THERE MAY BE SOME. CONFUSION OVER. OR THE WAY STATED OVER EXACTLY. WHO IS ON THE LIST WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LESSONS. THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT WITH BE EASY REGULARLY AND VICE VERSA- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE EPIDEMIC ROUGHLY I WILL GIVE YOU SOME SOME SOME NUMBERS THERE BEING APPROXIMATELY- FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY OR SO FROZEN CARDS OF WHICH- SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. CARDS HAVE NOW BEEN UNFROZEN- OVERTIME- AND- THAT'S FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. RELATED TO THE DETERMINATION OF WHO IS AN ALLEGED- WHO IS A LEGITIMATE BENEFICIARY. CLAIMS AND SO THAT IS WHERE THE- THE RESPONSIBILITY IS SPLIT BETWEEN AUSTIN EDT OR I SHOULD SAY THE EDT HAS RESPONSIBILITY OF VERIFYING THAT SOMEONE IS LEGITIMATE CLAIM IN. WHEN THEY VERIFY THAT SOME OF THE DILIGENT CLAIM AND THEY DIRECTED TO US. AND WE RUN THAT PERSON- BY A DIFFERENT CRIMINAL DATABASES WE HAVE JUST ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TRIGGERING ANY CRIMINAL DATABASES THAT IF THAT CHECKS OUT THEN. THE CARD IS UNFROZEN IN BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS THAT'S THE PROCESS. SO I'M SORRY I MISSPOKE ABOUT SOMETHING IMPROPERLY. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND CARDS HAVE BEEN UNFROZEN. SINCE THAT SINCE LAST SUMMER. AND- THAT IS BETWEEN EDT IN OURSELVES MAJORITY AT THE BEHEST BDK. SO IT JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT EDT IS THE ONE THAT IS VERIFYING WHETHER THE COUNTY SHOULD BE FROZEN OR NOT FROZEN. IT'S NOT THE BANKS WITH YOU'RE NOT DOING IT YOURSELF INDEPENDENTLY. THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF- FREEZES ONE IT THAT THE LARGEST AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED EARLIER WAS WAS WAS DONE AT THE DIRECTION OF THE EDT. IN EARLY OCTOBER. AND THEN THERE IS A SECOND LARGE BATCH OF THE DIRECTION OF THE EDT IN DECEMBER. AND THERE'S A THIRD CATCHER THAT I WOULD PUT THAT INTO ONE CATEGORY AND THERE'S A THIRD THE SECOND CATEGORY OF CARS THAT ARE FROZEN BY US. AT THE REQUEST OF OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RESPOND FORCING NETWORKS- I WOULD ACTUALLY BY MY COLLEAGUE- BILL BOX WHO- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRIMES IN COMPLIANCE AS WELL AS- THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF INCENTIVES TO STOP THAT PROCESS IS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE HELPFUL TO. YOUR QUESTION. BILL SURE THANK YOU- I THINK I THINK THAT'S A CORRECTLY THAT THAT PERSON GREEN WE'VE INCREASED CARDS WILL NEED OR ACCESS TO ONE OF THE HELPERS THAT THEY NEED THE TERM CARDHOLDERS ARE. ENTITLED TO BE ABLE OR OR ELEGY FOR AN ENCORE A PRO PROGRAM- NEED TO BE- I TELL THAT ARE FROZEN BY THE EXERCISE OF OUR RESPONSE ON REQUIRED R. FOR ARE PRO AND TO BRING CRIME SO WE CALL WITH WE ACTUALLY HAVE A- SMALL NUMBER DON'T HAVE THE HAND. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO BUT I I'VE I'M RELATIVELY SMALL OF CLOUD WE HAVE. AND WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE COME ACROSS THEM FROM. IN THE OF OUR- TO OUR- OVERSIGHT OF THE THAT THAT IS JUST IN THE OF CRIME. AND WE WANT THAT HAVE WE WILL FREEZE. OR COME IN I GET OUT OF IN A SMALL SET- BUT- CORRECTIVE. WE WILL FREEZE BECAUSE WITH. ONE FOR EITHER A IS A WITH WITHIN. THAT WOULD BE A- OF QATAR WITH EVEN AS MORE POURING WHERE WHERE THEY WILL WANT TO- TAKE ACTS AGAINST THE- CARD OR- FOR SERIES OF CARDS. SO THAT NO WOULD BE TO RE. THAT WE FREE- ON OUR OWN- AND. AND- SB DANCE ANY ABOUT THAT BUT I CAN. SO IF YOU IF YOU RECEIVE IN FROM LINE FOR YOU YOU'D GENERALLY WOULD IS WE UNTIL I'M- CLEARS IT UP ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. YES YEAH IT WOULD BE A LONG COURSE OF WELL. ONE PORCELAIN PALACE EITHER YOU KNOW THE ESSAY APPROACHES WITH FOR EXAMPLE IS PETER MARK THAT THAT'S AND- THAT'S PRETTY INDICATIVE OF. GOING TO SEE THAT ACCOUNT RIGHT IN THAT WOULD THAT WOULD PUT THAT ICON IN DISTASTE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THEY APPRECIATED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO BEFORE WE MOVE ON I WAS INFORMED THAT- BANK OF AMERICA MAY BE LEAVING THE LINE BUT SOMEBODY MAY BE STAYING COULD YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR US BECAUSE WE WOULD REALLY. I'M SURE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. OKAY BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ALL STILL ALIVE RIGHT NOW. OKAY AND YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU- WE- CENTER CORTEZ A- THANK YOU MANAGER- FOR THE AUDITOR. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A FOR YOUR WORK A COMPREHENSIVE WORK- I HAVE A QUESTION IF YOU WERE. RECOUNTING OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN IN I'VE AT LEAST GOTTEN AS FAR AS READING OF THE SUMMARIES OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN OF COURSE ISN'T YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY SO EXCUSE ME IF I HAVE. NOT BUT YET RUN ACROSS- ALL THE DETAIL THAT- THE MIGHT BE REFLECTED IN IN SOME OF MY QUESTIONS- REGARDING WERE STATUTORY CHANGE IS NEEDED. I BELIEVE IT WAS UNDER THAT CATEGORY THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. AND EVERY THREE YEAR REASSESSMENT. GIVEN THE AND I CAN I CAN ACCEPT IN EVERY THREE YEAR REASSESSMENT WITH SOME SORT OF SCOPE TO IT. HELLO HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT OR ANALYSIS ON YOUR PART- IS TO EASE SENSUALLY SETTING UP SHOP. IN EDT- WITH ONGOING ARMY PRACTICES LIKE YOU WOULD SEE IN A TYPICALLY IN IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY AND OBVIOUSLY THE IRS DOES THAT I DROVE IT'S OBVIOUS BUT IT'S- SOMEWHAT COMMON PRACTICE FOR- INTERNAL REVENUE TO SET UP. A IN OUR LARGEST SO C. CORPORATIONS- ONGOING AUDIT PRACTICES LITERALLY. ON SITE. IN GIVEN THE HISTORY WITH EDT OF. LACK OF CORRECTION ACCEPTANCE OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PAST IS UNDERSTANDABLE LACK OF ACTUAL CORRECTION- I GUESS PARDON ME IF I'M- A LITTLE CONCERNED BE NEW HERE TO THE STATE SENATE AS TO. WHETHER OR NOT THAT PATTERN IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND THAT'S NO REFLECTION ON THE CURRENT DIRECTOR BUT PERHAPS A LARGER SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF FROM WORRIED ABOUT. THE IDEA OF. ONGOING CAPACITY WHICH WOULD MEAN ON ANY GIVEN DAY- A TWENTY YEAR AUDITORS ARE AN OUTSIDE AUDITOR EITHER ON THE MANAGEMENT AUDIT SIDE OR ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE- OF THE COULD DIVE IN IN- VERIFY THAT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING ENACTED OR THAT OF FRAUD OR OTHER FISCAL YEARS ISSUES ARE ARE TAKING PLACE- THAT WOULD HARM THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT US BEING EMBEDDED AND EDG WE HADN'T CONTEMPLATED THAT AS THE EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT AUDITOR IN CALIFORNIA. WE WE'VE NOT DONE THAT- TYPICALLY WILL BE AUDITING AND DEPARTMENT AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE EITHER THROUGH STATUTE OR THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AS THEY THE AUDIT THAT WAS APPROVED ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS LAST FALL. THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS CAME TO US WITH RESPECT TO ONGOING- MONITORING OF EIGHTY WE CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS OR MY TESTIMONY THAT EVERY NINETY DAYS WE WILL BE EXPECTING A STATUS REPORT FOR ME D. D. R. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE- FOR. AT LEAST A YEAR IF NOT LONGER THAN THAT- BUT HOPEFULLY A LOT OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE'VE PUT SPECIFIC MILESTONES IN THEM. WILL GET IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WE EXPECT SOME IMMEDIATELY LIKE I REFER TO BE OF A GETTING THAT COMPREHENSIVE LIST- MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING. BOERO MENTIONED- SOME CONCERNS WITH ID ME NOW WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE WE DID IDENTIFIES IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND CLAIMANTS. WHO WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY VERIFYING THEIR IDENTITY AND YOU KNOW WERE WERE- POTENTIALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS SO THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE I. D. ME AND- GETTING KICKED OVER TO THE MANUAL PROCESS. BUT WE WOULD HAVE BACK TO YOUR QUESTION WE HAVE THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW WHERE WE WILL CONSISTENTLY EXPECT TO HEAR FROM EDT WILL ASSESS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING US. WHY HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK IN AND DO FOLLOW UP WORK WE TYPICALLY WAIT TO GIVE AN AGENCY AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS- WE CERTAINLY CAN PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. NINE MONTHS WHERE. THE MAJORITY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH RESPECT TO THE THREE YEAR- ASSESSMENT AS YOU INDICATED THAT IS REALLY RELATED TO THE RECESSION PLAN- THE FIRST PART OF THAT RECOMMENDATION IS. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES PUT IN STATUTE THAT A RECESSION PLAN A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS REQUIRED WE SUGGESTED CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT PLAN LIKE. LOOKING AT YOUR PROCESS IS LOOKING AT YOUR STAFFING. TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO A SURGE IN THE EVENT WE'RE- IN A RECESSION. BUT THEN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER THE REASON WE THOUGHT THREE YEARS WAS REASONABLE IS BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CYCLE OF RECESSION IT'S FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX YEARS. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU. ASKED ABOUT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW AN AUDITOR EMBEDDED IN THE ADMINISTRATION SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION- OR I WOULD ASSUME PRIVATE SECTOR NEVER WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW CERTAINLY PRIVATE SECTOR. FIRMS HAVE INTERNAL AUDITORS AUDITORS WHO ARE REPORTING TO THE BOARD OF REPORTING TO THE CEO- AND CONDUCTING AUDIT WORK AT THAT PARTICULAR FIRM OR AT. CORPORATION THE FEDERAL LEVEL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL I FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE INTERNAL AUDITORS A. LOT OF STATE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE IN TURN ORDERS- EACH. BACK IN THE DAY- I WAS DOING WORK IN THE FIELD. HAVE THEIR OWN IN TURN AUDIT SHOP WERE THEY WOULD BE. REPORTING TO THE DIRECTOR OR IN MAY BE REPORTING TO THE AGENCY SECRETARY IF THAT'S NECESSARY. IN CONDUCTING AUDITS WHERE THEY HAVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE ABILITY REPORT EXTERNAL TO THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE AUDITING THAT'S WHAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IN ORDER TO AN INTERNAL AUDITOR SHOULDN'T BE REPORTING TO A PROGRAM MANAGER BECAUSE THAT. GRAHAM MANAGER PUT CAN INFLUENCE THE HONORED THE AUDITOR NEEDS TO HAVE AS MUCH INDEPENDENCE ARE ACTING AS AN INTERNAL AUDITOR THE OTHER- JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AN AUTO SHOP WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT BROUGHT IT OUR GROUP DOES GO OUT TO DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND AUDIT THEM I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK UNDER THEIR CARES ACT IN LOOKING AT. HOW READY AND HOW PREPARED A STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN TO ADMINISTER PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AS FAR AS MAKING SURE WERE ADMINISTERING THE FEDERAL MONEY COMING INTO CALIFORNIA APPROPRIATELY SO THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE THEIR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT WORK DONE. CERTAINLY MY OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE OUR OVERSIGHT AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES BY REVIEWING WHAT EDT IS REPORTING TO US AS FAR AS THEIR PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE WOULD CERTAINLY. BRING ANY CONCERNS- TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION AND WE PUBLISH ALL OF THAT INFORMATION ON. OUR WEBSITE SO THE PUBLIC WOULD KNOW AS WELL. JUST FOR FUN THANK YOU- FOR ALL THOSE THOUGHTS AND- YES WAS A HAVE. ANOTHER PRIVATE EXPERIENCE INCLUDING BANKING TO KNOW THAT THE INTERNAL AUDITOR SHOWS UP. OF BEING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ORGANIZATION- WHEN THEY WANT. UNEXPECTEDLY OFTENTIMES WAITING AT YOUR DOOR FOR YOU AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU SHOW UP IN THE MORNING- IN MY EXPERIENCE- WITHOUT WAS A WORKS PRETTY WELL TO STAY ON TOP OF THINGS. OF IT BUT- I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND- ALL THE JUST- EXPLAIN WHAT SOME OF THE OPTIONS ARE. IS THERE ANY LEGAL OBSTACLE TO HAVING YOUR SHOP- BE EMBEDDED EITHER SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM IN A STATE AGENCY LIKE ADD OR IN A COVERT ROLLOUT HOME LIKE WILL BE EMBARKING ON SOON WITH A CD. WITH LANDLORD TENANT I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT THAT WERE. WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING THAT PER SE TODAY WAS HOLDING OUT AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF. A MULTI BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COAL WOULD. RELIEF THAT'S GOING OUT- EVIDENTLY- AT THIS POINT WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL. AUDITING FUNCTION IN BED AND I'M JUST WANTING TO WHAT EXTENT YOU HAVE- YOU CAN LEGALLY LEGALLY BE DEPLOYED THAT WAY A BY THE LEGISLATURE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. WHAT KIND OF AUGMENTATION YOU IN IN TERMS OF CAPACITY. WELL CERTAINLY THERE ARE THERE ISN'T REALLY A STATUTORY IMPEDIMENT TO US CONDUCTING AUDIT WORK AT ANY STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA ARE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO CONDUCT AUDITS OF ANY PUBLICLY CREATED AND SEE ANY STATE AGENCY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET IN. WE WOULD NEED TO DO THAT AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE EITHER THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE OR THROUGH A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. NOW THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- THAT MY OFFICE HAVE TO COMPLETE EXAMPLE IS AND JUST MUCH SMALLER SCALE BUT WE ARE AT THE STATE BAR EVERY TWO YEARS THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO PUT THAT IN STATUTE- AND REQUIRE US TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT. ASPECTS OF THE STATE BAR'S FUNCTION SOME YEARS WE LOOK AT THEIR DISCOMFORT SAYS OTHER YEARS WE LOOK AT OTHER ISSUES- WITH RESPECT THE STATE BAR SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CERTAINLY PUTS A REQUIREMENT IN. STATUE FOR MY OFFICE TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT AUDITS IMMEDIATELY WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL- IS. OUR STANDARD ARE STATUTES REQUIRES ARE ENABLING STATUTE REQUIRES US TO FOLLOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS WE HAVE TO BE ANINDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN ENTITY. THAT'S TO FILL SOME REQUIREMENTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASK IS MY OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLEFOR. AUDITING FEDERAL MONEY THAT COMES IN THE CALIFORNIA ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND AS I INDICATED A FEW INUTES AGO UNDER OUR STATE HIGH RISK AUTHORITY WE DESIGNATED ALL THIS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY COMING IN TO CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CARE IS ACT AS A HIGH RISK ISSUE THAT GIVES MY OFFICE THE AUTHORITY. TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN OUT AT DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES CONDUCTING AUDIT WORK OF KERR'S ACT MONEY COMING INTO CALIFORNIAN HOW WELL THOSE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERING THOSE DOLLARS BILLION DEPARTMENT FINANCE WERE IN DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING SOME OTHER ISSUES. SO WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT WORK WHERE I'M REFERRING TO AS FAR AS THE AUDITING STANDARDS WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR INDEPENDENCE SO WE CAN'T BE COULD BECOME PART OF EDT MANAGEMENT AND MAKING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS FOR EDT. CERTAINLY CAN DO AN ANALYSIS LIKE WE DID THE TWO ARTISTS WE ISSUED THE END OF JANUARY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO MONITOR AND CRITIQUE WHAT EIGHTY OR ANY STATE AGENCY THAT WERE AUDITING- IS DOING TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT CERTAINLY IF IT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURES INTERESTED IN HAVING MY OFFICE DO- IT WOULD HAVE TO EITHER GO THROUGHTHE GENTLEST OF AUDIT COMMITTEE. OR THROUGH I STYLE SIX THAT WOULD NEED TO BE IN STATUTE. IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED US TO BE. EMBEDDED IN THE D. ESSENTIALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE NIGHT A. A. PRECIADO IF NOT ALL OF THE- INDEPENDENCE IN THE GAP REQUIREMENTS UNDERSTAND HE WOULD. HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REPORT DIRECTLY THE LEGISLATURE AS I UNDERSTAND IT I THANK YOU FOR THOSE ANSWERS- VERY ENLIGHTENING I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IN AND I THINK THIS WOULD WILL BE FREE FOR YOU- MISS OIL I JUST I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE AT THE OUTSET YOU TALKED ABOUT- BEEN STOPPING AND TURNING OUT OF THAT ATTORNEYS HERE. BUT ON THE FROZEN ACCOUNTS AND I'M WONDERING. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY THERE- TO THE CITY CALIFORNIA- TO THE BANK OF AMERICA- YOU KNOW TO ANYBODY WHO'S A PARTY TO THAT ARRANGEMENT- YOU KNOW GET ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LENGTHY TIME IT'S TAKING TO RELEASE- ESSENTIALLY THOSE FREEZES OF THOSE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS- NEW EITHER UNDER. CONVERSION THEORY OR ORDER ESSENTIALLY- CONSTRUCTIVE- EMINENT DOMAIN THEORY OR ANY OTHER THREE WITH THE GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED OR PRIVATE SECTOR AND HE'S INVOLVED IN GOING IN AND LOCKING UP THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S. PERSONS AN INDIVIDUAL AS AN INNER CITY SINCE- RIGHT TO THEIR OWN PROPERTY IN- I WONDER IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT AND IF SO. IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET A MORE THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON THE- I DO HAVE COUNCIL AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THAT TO ASSIST IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. WE DIDN'T DO WAY A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE BMA CONTRACT WE CERTAINLY WERE AWARE THE CONTRACT WE LOOK AT THAT FOR YOU FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF YEAH BFA CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS EIGHTY TO MANAGE THE BENEFIT CARDS AND THE FACT THAT WE SAW SO MANY ACCOUNTS BEING FROZEN. AND ARE OUR CONCERNS WITH ADD NOT WORKING WITH TO BE A DAY- AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS THEY COULD TO MAKE SURE THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS ACCOUNTS WERE UNFROZEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS I SAID AS OF DECEMBER THERE WERE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON FROZEN OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND THAT WE WERE AWARE OF- I WILL DEFER TO MY ASSOCIATE CHIEF COUNSEL HEATHER KENDRICK. I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT I CERTAINLY WILL GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU. HELLO BUT A LOT OF CORRECTLY DID NOT LOOK DIRECTLY THAT ISSUE AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A AN ANSWER I DO KNOW THAT- BANKING INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW FEDERAL LAWS REGARDING SECURITY AND FRAUD AND MAKING SURE TO MINIMIZE AND IF THEY DETECT FRAUD THEY HAVE TO TAKE ACTION- I'M ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST MAKE AMERICAN EDT- AROUND THESE ISSUES. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL HAS A SPECIFIC CAUSE OF ACTION THAT THEY CAN BRING BUT- THAT IS WHERE WE ARE ON THE SIDE. YOU THINK YOU JUST TO FOLLOW UPS ONE COULD YOU- GET US MEANING THAT THIS COMMITTEE OF IF NOT THE ENTIRE- LEGISLATURE- ON. A POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF ON THOSE FROZEN ACCOUNTS. LET ME- LET ME TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS SO I DON'T HAVE TO HOLD YOU UP IN THAT IS DO WE HAVE A WATER RIGHTS FROM THE BANK OF AMERICA CONTRA. YES WE DO ABSOLUTELY UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE EIGHTY FIVE FORTY SIX POINT SEVEN WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO AUDIT. ANY CONTRACT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A CONTRACT THAT INVOLVES. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE PUBLIC FUNDS INSTEAD CALIFORNIA. IN IN WITH ALTADENA. THE BANK OF AMERICA CONTRACT REQUIRE. A SEPARATE ACTION. BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE JOINDOTA COMMITTEE. BEYOND WHAT'S BEEN TAKEN AS FAR. I'M NOT GO AHEAD YEAH I I'DLIKE TO GO AHEAD HEATHER I'M SORRY GO AHEAD NO I BELIEVE YES IT WOULD REQUIRE A J. LIKE TO. INSTIGATE THAT ACTION UNLESS IT WOULD FALL WITHIN OUR STATE HIGH RISK AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO FIND THIS CONTRACTORS STATE HIGH RISK BUT I DEFERRED TO. MADAM AUDITOR. SHE'S RIGHT I'M SORRY I GUESS AND A NEED TO- REMINDED ME I WAS JUST REMINDED THAT WE HAVE TO LEAVE THESE CHAMBERS AT TWELVE. WE HAVE TO WHICH INCLUDES THE REMAINDER OF OUR SENATORS AS WELL AS PUBLIC COMMENTS SO- JUST A REMINDER THANK YOU. CAN JUST ABOUT WRAPPED UP AND I'M SURE THANK YOU- FOR THE REMINDER IN THE TIME CHECK- I MET AGAIN HAPPY TO TAKE THAT. INFORMATION YOU KNOW IN WRITING OFFLINE PARTICULARLY. SO BECAUSE IT'S A BEING LEGAL IN NATURE HAVING TO DO WITH. POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY BE BETTER IF THAT'S OF PRESENTED TO US IN. A PRIVILEGE DOCUMENT ALL THAT COUNTS WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- I WASN'T CLEAR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I GOT A YES OR NO ON. ON GETTING THE SAID INFORMATION- AFTER TODAY. SENATOR WE CAN GET YOU INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND AUDITING CONTRACTS AS- MISS KENDRICK INDICATED IN SOME CASES IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IT'S MY BELIEF AND WILL WILL CLARIFY AND GET YOU THE CORRECT INFORMATION THAT AND IN SOME CONTRACT LANGUAGE THE ENTITY HAS TO ASK US TO AUDIT THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT ON BEHALF THE STATE CALIFORNIA BUT WILL WE WILL WE'LL GET THE CLEAR INFORMATION FOR YOU. THE OTHER SUGGESTION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU WITH RESPECT TO- AND AN ANALYSIS OF THE STATE BANK OF AMERICA CONTRACT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE AND LIABILITY IS YOUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL THERE IS THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULD. BE IN A BETTER POSITION WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY LEGAL TEAM WHICH ARE FANTASTIC TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN MORE REAL TIME THAN HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE DIRECTING US TO DO WORK WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU AND PERHAPS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE B. OF A CONTRACT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU'RE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WOULD BE- SWELTER WELL ABLE. TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND ALSO THE YOUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO YOU IN A PRIVILEGED. AWAY AS- WHERE WE COULD NOT. WE SHOULD THANK YOU- IN HIM I THOUGHT. HERE JUST OF- FOR MY OWN BONE BALL IF YOU WERE IS TO. LET'S COUNT MAY NEED. THE BENEFIT OF AN AUDIT OF THE BE OF A CONTRACT IN ORDER TO GIVE US THE KIND OF THROUGH LEGAL OPINION AS TO THE FLOW OF LIABILITY WEATHER'S BETWEEN THE STATE BANK OF AMERICA THE STATE AND BANK OF AMERICA AS TO THE- THE- THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR ACCOUNTS FROZEN AT CETERA'S. ABOUT YOU GIVE ME ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. TODAY THE ONLY OTHER. QUESTION I HAVE IN IT'S REALLY A COMMON IN AGAIN OF JUST S. I'VE ALREADY TAKEN THIS UP WITH EDT- IN OF THE PREVIOUS BRIEFING AND- VACANT- THE AUDITOR JUST. FOR A QUICK- LIGHTNING ROUND OF THOUGHTS HERE SO I CAN GET OFF THE FLOOR IN THAT IS WITH REGARD TO STANDING UP THE CALL CENTER WE- HEARD THE NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ARE GOING TO BE HIRED- IT SOUNDS LIKE. IN THIS COMMAND CENTER CALL CENTER IT WOULDN'T BE SCHEDULED TO BE UP AND RUNNING UNTIL MAY- THAT'S HARD TO SWALLOW. FOR US I THINK AND I SPEAK I THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT ARE ALSO GONNA BE EVEN HARDER TO SWALLOW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. AWAITING THAT CAN HELP- IT WAS THERE ANY ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION IN THE SHORT TERM AUDIT. RECOMMENDATIONS TO AT LEAST STANDING UP. A CALL CENTER THAT CAN SERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW- WHERE TO GO- WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY WILL BE GETTING BACK TO THEM. WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO THEM ELSEWHERE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE GOING TO A WEBSITE- TO FILE A CLAIM OR TO APPEAL THE CLAIM- WE'RE AT THIS POINT IT SOUNDS LIKE. AND UNTIL MAY AND I UNDERSTAND THE CALL VOLUME I HEARD THAT NUMBER. BUT MOST THE PEOPLE MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE- HAVE RUN CAMPAIGNS- OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING. WERE WERE MILLIONS AND OF CALL HAVE. MADE AND RECEIVED ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH CONTRACTED OUT CALL CENTERS- M. JUST WONDER IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS WHOSE. LOOK AT LEAST UP TILL NOW- I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION- AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT AND TEN PERHAPS- MISTER HARRIS WHO IS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THE PROJECT CAN EXPAND ON THAT BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS WE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PHONE SYSTEM THEIR VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTERS- IT WHICH ALLOWS THEIR CALL CENTER FOLKS TO WORK REMOTELY WHICH WAS IMPORTANT OF COURSE IN THE PANDEMIC WHAT WE NOTICED ABOUT THE CALL CENTER AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PHONE SYSTEM. IS WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED A NEW FOR THE C. C. AS THEY REFER TO THE VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER- THEY LOST SOME FEATURES THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN THEIR PREVIOUS CALL CENTER WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FEATURES ONE IS A CALL BACK OPTION YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR NUMBER AND- SOMEONE WILL END UP CON CALLING YOU BACK AND GETTING BACK TO YOU. TO TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THE OTHER I TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT IN MY IN MY PRESENTATION WHICH IS TRACKING THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT CALL CENTERS ARE RESPONDING TO AND PUTTING TOGETHER FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT WHICH IS CONSUMING A LOT OF RESOURCES IN MEDIAS IN THE PAST THEY HAD PRE RECORDED MESSAGES AS PART OF THEIR CALL CENTERS PART OF THEIR FUNCTIONALITY NOW INDIVIDUALS AT EDT OR HAVING TO READ THOSE PRE RECORDED. MESSAGES AND INFORMATION SO IF THEY CAN REESTABLISH PRERECORDED MESSAGES WHERE I GET INTO. THE SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A MENU THAT SAYS IF YOU HAVE THIS TYPE OF QUESTION PRESS ONE ETCETERA OR IF YOU WANNA. LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER WHERE YOU WILL GET A CALL BACK SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO EDT NOW THAT THEY SHOULD IMPLEMENT ALSO THAT THEIR CALL- ON CENTER IS. IS EVEN MORE EFFICIENT THAN IT IS NOW. THANK YOU THIS IS. DIRECTORS AND ALSO LIKE RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION. SO I WANT CLEAR PERHAPS ON I WAS NOT CLEARING. WE ARE NOW WAITING. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CALL CENTER. WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WAKE UP WITH THAT THOUGHT I GO TO SLEEP WITH THAT THOUGHT INSERTED MY EXECUTIVE TEAM AND THE OTHER DEPUTIES. SO YES THAT IS THE TARGET THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE AUDITOR. AND- WE SHOULD HAVE MORE COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS BY THAT TIME BUT WE ARE LOOKING EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT FEATURES THAT WILL BENEFIT THE CLAIMANTS ARE GOING TO BE ADDED TO THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU LESS COMING THROUGH THE CHILDREN WE JUST LET ME JUST SAY IT WAS WE HAD TO MAKE IT SHORT PLEASE AND I WILL WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- BUT IN A PRIOR BRIEFING- WITH MY OFFICE. UNTIL SAY A PUBLICLY LISTED A CALIFORNIA- TOLL ARE COUNTY WHERE I WAS UNTIL DECEMBER FIFTH OF LAST YEAR IS COUNTY SUPERVISOR THAT WE HAD TO STAND UP A CONTACT RACING PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY. OF WE DIDN'T WAIT FOUR MONTHS OR FIVE MONTHS TO HIRE PEOPLE OF WE MOVE PEOPLE AROUND AND PUT NINE HUNDRED CONTACT RESEARCH TOGETHER. OF VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT- THREE SIMPLE MEET AND CONFER ANIMAL USE WITH EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO WERE MORE THAN EAGER TO BE HELPFUL AND BE REASSIGNED TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY HELP SOMEBODY THAT'S SUFFERING FROM THE PANDEMIC. OF IT JUST STRIKES ME THE NINE HUNDRED FOLKS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN AN ENTITY MUCH BIGGER THAN A COUNTY SANTA CLARA THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO FIND AND REASSIGNED. INTO IT HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT OUR OUR OUR UNIONS OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WOULD WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF THAT KIND OF. OF VERY VERY IMPORTANT RELIEF WORK SO I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU AND I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A BETTER WAY THAN WAITING UNTIL MAY. TWENTIETH FOR MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF MAY OF THIS YEAR- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK I'M JUST TELLING YOU IT'S NOT GONNA. WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU. I I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO RESPOND THAT. I WONDER ASSURE. THE SENATE. YEAH WE HAVE DONE THAT THE- WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE PHONES THIS NINE HUNDRED IS AN ADDITION TO THAT- OBVIOUSLY. WAITING UNTIL- A DISTANCE OF PERIOD WOULD BE UP. A TRAVESTY SO WE ARE INCREASING WE HAVE MOVED PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THAT JUST AS THE SENATOR SO- CLEARLY SUGGESTED WE DO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE- LINED UP HERE SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR DOLLY SAID EARLY MULLIN SENATOR PORTANTINO. SENATOR MEN SENATOR OR CHIRLA BOTH. SO OKAY AND THEN WE MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU ALL CENTER NIELSEN. THEN PRESIDENT RONALD KIND OF SHORTEN MY INQUIRIES SO THAT THERE ARE MANY AND THEY WILL NOT ALL BE ANSWERED TODAY- THE DIRECTOR ST. IT TRAINING HAS BEEN SPOKEN TO BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND EVEN WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY. WHEN THE TRAINING ISN'T GOING TO BE AFFECTED ON NEW INDIVIDUALS THEN TAT MEANS EXISTING PEOPLE WHO ARE. SENIOR IN POSITIONS ARE THEN BECOMING THE TRAINERS. BACKS UP THE JOB THAT IS NOT GETTING DONE FOR THEIR VACANCY A POSITION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND WE RAN INTO THAT PROBLEM. IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC UNFOLD STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATION THAT ARE PEOPLE BEING MOVED BACK SO THAT THEY COULD BE EFFECTIVELY WORKING WITH CLIENTS DIRECTLY. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS. EXPANDING OUR TRAINING TEAM AND I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING UP TO PEOPLE HAVEN'T WORK WITH CALL CENTERS BEHIND THE SCENES. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE CALL CENTER. IS TO HAVE SCREENS AVAILABLE. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONDING TO CALLS THAT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. SO THAT A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF INFORMATION CAN BE GIVEN IN A SINGLE CALL. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE INITIATED WE HAVE A NEW. TOOL TO LOOK AT THAT I AM PERSONALLY GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE TEAM TO ENSURE THAT AS MUCH OF THAT HAS BEEN EXPANDED AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE INFORMATION FROM TRAINING MANUALS. GEN FROM CLEMENT. INSURANCE LETTERS SO IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE ABLE TO TRUNCATE THE TRADING. THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TOOL IN RESPONDING TO THE CLAIM. IT'S A BASIC STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE. AND THAT IS GOING TO HELP SO PEOPLE WILL NOT NEED AS MUCH TRAINING AS THEY'VE GOTTEN THE PAST WILL NEED TO BE TRAINED TO USE THE SYSTEM. FORMER DIRECTORS. OF YOUR DEPARTMENT. WELL NOT NAME BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF. REALLY NOT BEING FORTHRIGHT. TO THE PUBLIC. I ASSURE HIGH HOPE YOU AREN'T SURE THAT THEY'LL BE MUCH MORE CANDOR NOW. AND SUNLIGHT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS. AND AGAIN I WILL NOTE THAT THE CALLS HAVE HARDLY DIMINISHED INTO OUR OFFICES AT LEAST. THE ONES THAT I HAVE. AND SO THAT'S MY BENCHMARK FOR PROGRESS. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD IT'S STILL NOT GOOD FOR A LAUGH YES I'VE BEEN THERE FOR A MONTH. WE ARE MAKING CHANGES. WE'RE GOING TO ACCELERATE ANY OF THOSE CHANGES THAT WE CAN REGARDING TRANSPARENCY AND HONESTY ANYONE WHO HAS WORKED WITH ME OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS CAN TELL YOU. I AM A BIG FAN OF TRANSPARENCY. AND IT HAS TO BE ACCURATE SO I'M NOT HERE. TO THERE'S NO POINT THAT I CAN TAKE THIS JOB BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CAKE WALK. I TOOK THIS JOB BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THERE WERE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. BASED ON MY FORTY YEARS AS AN EXECUTIVE. WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN POSTURING. SO THAT YOU WILL GET THE BOTTOM LINE TRUTH FOR ME I PROMISE YOU. I COMPLEMENT TO THE IN INDEED AND- YOU WILL BE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT TOO RARE IN MY EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT. ARE THESE COULD LEASE CONTRACTS AND I UNDERSTAND BY FORMER. ASSURANCES HERE THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW THESE CONDO LOTS CONTRACTED TO BE OF A CONTRACT. ABSOLUTELY OKAY FINE YOU'RE WELCOME TO THEM. WE WILL CALL AND GIVE YOU A WAY I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE YET BUT- WILL BOOK CALLED TO TRY TO GET A LOOK IN THE CONTRACT AT THE DIRECTOR SAINTS. ARE THEIR SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO DELIVER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT DO THOSE CONTRACTING LIKE DISLIKE OR VIA THEY DO THEY HAVE TO. HAVE A PENALTY OR. WHAT WILL BE THE SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM. THE THEY DID LETTER CHIEF. YES THAT. GROUPS SENATOR NEED TERRACE WITH EDT- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I WOULD I WOULD THATEACH CON. IS DIFFERENT AND I KNOW BEST OF THE LAWYER IN BANK OF AMERICA SO I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A MUCH GREATER ISSUE. THAN JUST THIS ONE. KAYS'S CAL. FOR BILL AND- OF DOLLARS ON TECH. EQUIPMENT UPGRADES TRAININGS MANY MANY COMPANIES. AND WE NEVER GET IT RIGHT. THEY ALL I SHOULD BURN. THE CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW WE CAN CLAIM TO BE THE TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY APPLICATIONS IN MAJOR STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TO WORK. HAS MY FRONT STATION AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN WHATEVER WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. TECHNOLOGICALLY OVERHEAD LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. THE CITIZENS ARE FED UP. IT GOES TO THE ADMINISTRATION AT ALL LEVELS AND EVEN THE NEAREST TO THE FACT OF THE LEGISLATURE NOT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT. THE TIME IS NOW FOR ME WE ARE DONE WITH THESE FUN AND GAMES THE SOLAR GREEN OUR CITIZENS. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU TO ALL THREE CHAIRS THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN NEEDING FOR TEN MONTHS. THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING SO I WANTED PERSONAL I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITOR I THINK YOU REPORT IS SPOT ON. I THINK WE ARE MISSING- A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO MENTION- SO I'M A BUSINESS OWNER AND I ACTUALLY WE PAY IN THIS IS A TWO WAY STREET THERE'S THE OTHER I'VE NOT HEARD ONE THING ABOUT BUSINESS OWNERS. WE PAY IN SO THAT WHEN THERE IS UNEMPLOYMENT WHEN SOMEBODY'S UNEMPLOYED THERE IS A FUN THERE FOR THEM TO DRAW THE MONEY OUT OF. SO I THINK THAT THEY'RE IN IT YES OBVIOUSLY COVERT HAS CAUSED A PROBLEM BECAUSE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED. NUMBER ONE WE SHOULD PUT IN THIS- I THINK THE TO BE ADDED TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE THE EMPLOYER ENGAGED. IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE- YOU WON'T HAVE AS MANY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IF THE EMPLOYERS ARE RATIFYING THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY UNEMPLOYED. WHAT HAPPENED DURING COLBERT WAS WE HAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGE. MANY BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESS I'M I'M MAINLY TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES HERE. PEOPLE WITH LESS THAN TEN EMPLOYEES LIKE MYSELF. THERE'S NO ABILITY FOR THE BUSINESS OWNER UNDER THIS SCENARIO TO GET INTO THE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY SAY YES OR NO IF THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED YOU WOULD HAVE ELIMINATION. OF A LOT OF FRAUD IF YOU HAD THE BUSINESS OWNERS YOU CAN'T DRAW UNEMPLOYMENT LEISURE ACTUALLY. UNEMPLOYED NOW WE ALLOWED BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES TO CLAIM AS WELL SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A TAB SOMEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS OWNERS WHO HAVE NEVER FILED FOR THESE FUNDS BEFORE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM SO THAT'S- A SUGGESTION. FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S IN BUSINESS AND NUMBER- THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION IS THAT. UP TO THE BANK. BANKING SYSTEM THIS IS COMING I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU YOU'RE AWESOME BOB DOLE WAS ALL OF US HAVE HUNDREDS OF CASES OPEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE. TALKING ABOUT TAKING THEIR LIVES ARE SO DISTRAUGHT IF THIS IS THE MOST. UNBEARABLE SITUATION AS A LEGISLATURE I'VE EVER BEEN IN TRYING TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS. TEN NINETY NINES SO THERE ARE MANY- CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE. GOTTEN FRAUD BECAUSE THEY SOMEBODY GOT THEIR OWN OF THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND OTHER GETTING A TEN NINETY NINE. IN MOST CASES THEY NEVER USED RECEIVE A TWO NINE NINE BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T SILVA BORDER CAR OR ON CONTRACTED. AND THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE GOING TO BE. TAXED UPON THIS MONEY AND THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET. SO I WANT TO THE I KNOW THE BANK HAS. TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO. THE FEDS SENTENCED THEM TO TEN NINETY NINE SO I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING ABOUT THAT TSUNAMI THAT'S COMINGAS WELL. HI MY AND SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS CAN WE ADD TO- BUSINESSES INTO THIS PROCESS I THINK THE- THE NEW DIRECTOR. I NEED TO BE TALKING TO BUSINESSES BECAUSE IT'S A TWO WAY STREET. NUMBER TWO IS THE TEN NINETY NINES AND THEN NUMBER THREE- QUESTION NUMBER THREE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO FILL THESE BUT- YOU KNOW TO TAKE THIRTEEN WEEKS OF TRAINING WHAT WHAT IS THE SHORT TERM PLAN- FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE. HAVE BEEN WITHOUT UNEMPLOYMENT FOR- FIVE WEEKS. I'D BE GLAD TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR WE ARE WE HAVE TO UP OF THREE PERSON CALL TEN NINETY NINE CENTER. ALSO WE HAVE BEEN- NOTIFYING PEOPLE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO NOTIFY THEM BY TEXT BY EMAIL. OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS ARE TO WORK WITH THEM IF THEY DISCOVER THAT A TEN NINETY NINE HAS COME TO THEM THAT IS. NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY ANYTHING IN REALITY- BASICALLY THAT THEY DID NOT GET BENEFITS AND NOW pNINETY NINE. THAT SENSE THAT THE- SO WE HAVE A SISTER IN PLACE ALREADY NO THAT THIS COMING OUR AND DINNER AND IT ME JUST HER. THE SENATORS VERY RIGHT TO BE CAN ABOUT ANOTHER RESPONSE THAT BUSINESS. YES AND WHETHER OR NOT HE WERE WITH WE DO IS ALWAYS WERE WITH NEW IN SOME BUSINESS. LET ME SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN A SMALL BIZ PERSON. I KNOW WHAT IS TO BE. BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE PAYROLL I KNOW IT IS TO SET UP SOME THAT YOU. LIFE THEY WANT TO PASS TO YOU CHILDREN. I KNOW IT'S LIKE TO COME TO COVER FOR THAT ONE YOU TO GET MAKE YOU ONE TO TEAR YOUR HAIR OUT. SO- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT HIGH. I AM CRYING. OF DEEPER. THAT ARE SMALL. ARE EXT. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M A KNOW IT ALL ABOUT IT. I ALWAYS OPEN TO HEARING SMALL PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY. WELL I LIKE TO TAKE YOU THOSE CALL- I A AS A SMALL BIT OWNER WEEK WITH NEED TO BE OF THE SO AND I TO SHARE SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THE NEXT THING COMING WORK WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON A FOR A LONG. MANY BUSINESS ARE OUT OF THE- AND IN AND ONE THE THINGS GOING TO HAVE IS- BUSINESSES I PAID THE MONEY THAT. IS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN WE HAD THE LAST GIANT RESECTION. BUSINESSES WERE ASSESSED MORE FOR THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND IT TOOK UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO ACTUALLY. BECOME FULL FLASH AGAIN AND WE'RE GONNA SEE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOING TO BE REPAID IS REPAID BY BUSINESSES. AND THAT'S GOING TO PUT AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THOSE BUSINESSES AND IF THEY FAIL THEN WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYMENT SO I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE OTHER PARTNER WHICH IS THE BUSINESS SIDE AND NUMBER TWO- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- IN THE SHORT TERM I THINK YOU I'M EXCITED I LIKE YOUR **** I THINK THAT WE NEED THAT AND I WELL I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. THIS IS TIME THAT IT'S FINALLY TIME WITH THE LEGISLATORS ENGAGE WE NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION AN OLD FEET PEOPLE SPEAK TO THE FIRE IT'S TIME THAT WE AND I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RUN IN THIS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGE IT AND I'M AM I THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS. IT'S A MAN TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO OF ONE POINT THAT- THE SENATOR BROUGHT UP. THE FOR. MY THAT HAS BEEN SPENT IN THIS SITUATION. AND MY STAFF CAN CORRECTLY IS NOT GOING TO FALL TO THE PAVEMENT BY SMALL BUSINESSES. AT THIS POINT WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IS WHAT WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING. AND MY SECOND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. YEAH THIS IS GOING MANAGER CAN HELP CLEAR THAT UP- SO ARE YOU HEARD IN THE NEWS ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION BE PAID OUT IN BENEFITS 10% OF THAT. BEING POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT- THAT'S ABOUT AN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. 95% OF THAT ELEVEN BILLION IS FROM THE P. YOU A PROGRAM- IN SO THAT MONEY IS PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT REMAINING 5% IS. THE REGULAR YOU AYE PROGRAM THOUGH ABOUT HALF THAT MONEY IS ALSO FEDERAL FUNDS AND THEN IT'S THE ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS THE ACT AS IT WAS CALLED AROUND ARE THE CARERS. AXLE RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO DO AND IS A TWO AND- TWENTY THREE DOLLARS IN CONFIRM FOR THE U. I. PRO. BOB JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT. THANK YOU A ONE. YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS A PLACE WHERE WE COULD SEND OUR CONSTITUENTS OR WE CAN HELP THEM WITH THEIR TEN NINETY NINES WOULD YOU GET THAT INFORMATION TO US I DID NOT SEE IT. IN MY MATERIALS TODAY. ABSOLUTELY WE'LL GET THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR LAW CENTER LEE MULLIN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CALL THE THING MY CALL AND ME AND I AM THOSE I AND PM OF THE DESK IN BY ST ON THIS ISSUE AND- IS UNPRECEDENTED AND IT CREATES A BIG CHALLENGE WE HAVE NOW CASE WORKERS IN OUR OFFICES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIELD REPRESENTATIVES THAT ARE DOING THIS NONSTOP- MY QUESTIONS AND I THINK. WE CAN PROVIDE SOME BRIEF ANSWERS FOR- FIRST FOR B. MAY CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE RELATIVE COSTS TO AND SECURITY OF USING DIRECT DEPOSIT VERSUS DEBIT CARDS TO DELIVER THESE BENEFITS AND SECOND PARTY TO- THAT THAT QUESTION IS- THE UNDERSTANDING FOR US AS THAT EDT IS NOT DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBERS SO THEREFORE YOU GO THROUGH- EVERYTHING THROUGH SNAIL MAIL. OTHER STATES THAT YOU'RE WORKING. WITH PROVIDE YOU THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT. BEHALF WITHOUT- SO THE BACK TO THE- QUESTION. THERE IS A IS NO DOUBT THAT THE DEPOSIT IN. A BANK ACCOUNT- INTO- BEEN A BANK ACCOUNT. AT N. BANK. IS A FAR SAVE OPTION FOR. AND A PRETTY CARD- THE BANK ACCOUNT. IN THE NAME OF A CLAIM IN FOR BENEFITS MUST HAVE BEEN K. Y. AT MUST GONE THROUGH THE CHECKS BY THE RECIPIENT BANK. AND SO THAT ADDS A- A LEVEL OF SAFETY THE- THAT- BUT- WITH THE WITH THE PREPAID CARD- IT IS ALL LESS EXPENSIVE ALL AND- SAID. OBVIOUSLY THE ARE DIFFERENT- IN TERMS THE UNBANKED SO THAT'S THAT THE- HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE BUS BUT IN TERMS OF AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. AND CRIMINAL ACCESS TO THAT PAYMENT FLOW A DIRECT DEPOSIT OF FUNDS WHAT WAS UP STATE AND- SIX- WITH RESPECT TO- WOULD RISK TO- YOUR SECOND CENTER I BELIEVE WAS AROUND- YOUR MONEY AGAIN IF IT WAS AROUND. EMAILS AND PHONE NUMBER FOR THAN. STARTING IN FALL AND EMAIL AND- AND THEN PHONE NUMBERS. SO WE DO RECEIVE THAT FROM OTHER STATES AND IT DOES ALLOW US TO BRING A THE STATE. A MORE TIME ALERTS. YOU CARDHOLDER ACCLAIM. OR RECIPIENT THAT THEIR CAR HAS BEEN. BLOCKED OR FROZEN. AND BUT OBVIOUSLY TO PLACE ALMOST AS. PERSONALLY WITH THE STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IT DOES HI INTO FIRST- DIRECT DEPOSIT AND BANK ACCOUNTS IN TERMS OF TYPES INFORMATION IS CAP SYSTEM. OF OUR PARTNER UNEMPLOYED. OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE. ZERO- RIGHT NOW WE DON'T A LIST OF- SELDOM AND A FOR EMAIL I FOR CLIMATE A DON'T BELIEVE IT IT'S K. AS A RESULT WE DO. LARGELY VIA- FASHIONED POST DON'T KNOW POINTED OUT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING PEOPLE DISCUSS EDT AND COULD A PART. THE PROGRAM ON A FORWARD. THANK YOU. BUT AND THIS IS ALSO AN ACTIVE GREETED SYSTEM- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IF THERE IS A QUESTION THAT COMES UP WE JUST KEEP POINTING FINGERS TO EACH OTHER'S CALL CENTERS OR DOING SOME OF THIS- VIA AND TRADITIONAL MALE WHICH DOESN'T EXPEDITE- THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS- I AM I WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITH TIME- I YOU KNOW I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION- FOUR EDT- WHAT SERVICES DOES ACCENTURE. PROVIDING YOUR AND THAT ARE NOT DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT THE AUDITOR HAS. ALREADY RECOMMENDED WHAT'S THE UNIQUENESS THERE. SENATOR NEED TO VARIOUS- ACTUALLY WE JUST BROUGHT ON EXTENSION- LAST WEEK AND WE ACTUALLY MEET WITH THEM TOMORROW- AND WE WILL GO THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT I WILL TELL YOU YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IS- YOU KNOW LOOKING TO REFINE OUR FRAUD CRITERIA JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. REFINING ARE FRIED CRITERIA CERTAINLY ONE OF THE- THE TOP THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE THEM TO DO AS WELL AS- HELP US WITH SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT THE AUDITOR HAVE- HAS POINTED OUT. PERFECT THANK YOU AND I HOPE THAT WE DO YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE UNIQUENESS AS OPPOSED TO- YOU KNOW ANY ENTITY COMING IN AND DUPLICATING WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW- AND MY FINAL QUESTION IS FOR THE AUDITOR- THAT. YOU KNOW CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO SITUATIONS BEFORE ARE YOU HAVE DONE AUDITS OF DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES- AND THAT THAT CHALLENGE CONTINUES TO. TO PROCESS- WHAT WHAT CAN BE DONE WHAT HAS THE STATE AND IN THE PAST- WHEN DESPITE THE AUDITS DESPITE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE THE ON GOING- CHALLENGES. WELL IT AND IN MY EXPERIENCE THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE OTHER THE OTHER- SITUATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE PAST IS NOW USING YOU SEE ON IT FOR EXAMPLE- WHERE WE HAD SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR BUDGETING PRACTICES AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR CAMPUSES VERSUS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THERE WAS BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE- PUT INTO THE BUDGET THAT SUBSEQUENT YEAR THAT HELD YOU SEE ACCOUNTABLE- SO THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T RECEIVE UP A PORTION OF THEIR APPROPRIATION. OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD PUT SOME TYPE OF. CONTROL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET- WITH RESPECT TO EDT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING MUCH INTEREST INTERESTED IN DOING. BUT IN THE PAST IT REALLY HAS BEEN. MORE OF THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUALLY EXERCISING ITS OVERSIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE AN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO DIFFERENTLY- THEN HISTORICALLY THAT MY OFFICE HAS DONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE NOW PUT RECOMMENDATIONS OUT THAT HAVE. SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES AND WE WERE VERY CONSCIOUS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIME FRAMES WERE REASONABLE FOR EDT BUT WERE ALSO WITHIN THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN. YOU KNOW PARTNER WITH OUR OFFICE IN HOLDING. EDT ACCOUNTABLE TO IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU. IT SAYS THIS IS ANYTHING GIVEN CON. TO BE HAD IT IS MY HOPE AND MY DESIRE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS HEARING IS ONE WHERE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND- WE- THIS MUCH TIME DISCUSSING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE STEPS ARE TO GET TO AN OUTCOME- THIS IS A VERY VERY VERY BIG ISSUE. AS YOU'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES- SAY AND I WILL REPEAT- THIS IS HUGE- YOU KNOW OUR EFFECTIVENESS OR LACK THERE OF THESE BEING MEASURED ON THIS ISSUE- BUT YOU KNOW AS A LEGISLATURE AS A STATE ASSISTANCE- THAT WORK OR DON'T WORK SO- I APPRECIATE THIS AND I DO HOPE THAT THIS TAKES S TO THE NEXT STEPS. OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO SOLVE FOR THE MANY AT PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING. THANK YOU SENATOR- WHERE WE GO ON WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO- IT'S ABOUT QUARTER TO TWELVE WE MUST GIVE TIME TO A PUBLIC COMMENT BALSA BEEN TOLD IS A HARD. HARD TIME THE- TO END- SO JUST A REMINDER PLEASE AT I DON'T WANT TO CUT ANYBODY OFF AT THE END WITHOUT HAVING ANY OPPORTUNITY BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE. PUBLIC COMMENT SOMETIME CENTER PORTANTINO BETTER AT. THANK MEDICARE'S RIGHT IT'S BEEN IT'S THAT THE REPRESENTS THE BANK. WE HAVE- WE HAVE BEEN ANOTHER OBLIGATION THAT ACTUALLY STARTED AT THE HALF PAST ELEVEN AND WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETELY CLEAR OUR CALENDARS FROM THE SHORT NOTICE OF TODAY'S HEARING. IS WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION TODAY AND TO DOUBLE STANDARDS AS WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING. FURTHER QUESTIONS AS DIRECTED TO OUR COLLEAGUE BY BUTLER. SO ST NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO STAY. UNFORTUNATELY NOT OUR OUR- INITIALLY WE WERE TOLD IS A TWO HOUR HEARING ENDING AT ELEVEN AND- WE DID SAY ON THROUGH ELEVEN FORTY FIVE BUT WE- WE DID HAVE ANOTHER OBLIGATION THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CLEAR. OKAY CENTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELL MY ON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- TO ALL THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS- THIS HAS BEEN A AN IMPORTANT HEARING FOR OVERSIGHT AND S THE DAUGHTER SAID THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ALL OF CALIFORNIA- SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND A COUPLE COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY. THE FACT THAT THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AUDIT'S RECOMMENDATIONS WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED IS STAGGERING- THE FACT THAT THE INSTITUTION RESISTED- IMPROVEMENT AND CHANGE TO GET READY FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC. HAS HER CALIFORNIANS A SIGNIFICANTLY OBVIOUSLY DIRECTOR SCIENCES IS NOT WAS NOT PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING AND IS A IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR SO GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW WE HOPE THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS- ARE PUT FORTH AND IMPLEMENTED WITH GREAT HASTE OBVIOUSLY THE CASE WORK THAT OUR STAFF DO- TWO WEEKS IN THE LIFE OF A CONSTITUENT WHO'S FACING THIS ISSUE IS TOO MUCH TIME- AND WE HAVE HUNDREDS IN EACH OF OUR OFFICE EVERY DAY FACING THESE CHALLENGES- MY QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR YOU TALKED ABOUT GETTINGREPORT BACK EVERY NINETY DAYS. ON YOUR SUBSEQUENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED FOLLOWING UP ON THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR CORTESE- IN VETTING IN THE IN THE INSTITUTION MAY NOT BE AN OPTION BUT WHY NOT HAVE A THIRTY DAY REPORT BACK Y. NINETY DAYS WHY WAS NINETY DAYS CHOSEN GIVEN THE URGENCY FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD IT BE BETTER TO GET A REPORT BACK EVERY NINETY DAYS ON THE PROGRESS OF THE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION FOR. PERMITS HOUSE SURE- CERTAINLY WE COULD ASK FOR AND IF YOU DO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDES INFORMATION TO US EVERY THIRTY DAYS WE CAN LOOK AT- THEIR PROGRESS EVERY THIRTY DAYS AND NINETY DAY TIME FRAME TIES TO OUR HIGH RISK PROGRAM- AND WE HAVE HAD. TO IMPLEMENT- DRAFT REGULAR A SHE SORRY. REQUIRE THE NEW DAY LOOK BUT CERTAINLY JUST LIKE OUR TRADITIONAL SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR- IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS WILLING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US MORE FREQUENTLY EVERY THIRTY DAYS- MY STAFF WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO REVIEW THAT INFORMATION AND PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT. AND INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION THOROUGH HEARING THAT THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A STRONG SUGGESTION FROM ME THAT WE INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF THE REPORT BACK IN OBVIOUSLY SEND THAT TO THE CHAIRS AND LEGISLATURE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DIRECTOR HAS A COMMENT WOULD YOU VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE AN UPDATE EVERY THIRTY DAYS. THIS IS DIRECTOR SCIENCE. SO THE THIRTY DAY CERTAINLY WILLING TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. AS I SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE- THE WORKLOAD IS TREMENDOUS BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING OUR COMMAND CENTER TAKE A LOOK AT THESE THINGS ANYWAY SO LET ME TALK TO MY STAFF. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU AND AS I SAID YOU KNOW OUR CONSTITUENTS TWO WEEKS IN THEIR LIVES IS COULD BE LIFE OR DEATH COULD BE HOME OUR HOMELESSNESS COULD BE. A SICK CHILD I MEAN. THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND- YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING OPEN TO THAT. ON THE TRANSLATION ISSUE AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF FAMILIES AFFECTED- ARE LATINO- CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST DIVERSE STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY IN. MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN. MISS HOW HAS HAS YOUR OFFICE ISSUED ANY BEST PRACTICES ON TRANSLATION WE ROLLED OUT THE SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM. WHICH HAS THAT THE TRANSLATION PORTAL- IS SINCE THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE TV IS THERE A BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION THAT NOT ONLY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE EDT BUT- ACROSS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS. THAT THE STATE. INSTITUTES HI FOR THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY LOOK AT US SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT TRANSLATION HOWEVER. WE HAVE CONDUCTED AUDITS IN THE PAST DEFINITELY- ALLEGORY- BILINGUAL SERVICES ACT IT REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC. AND IF THE BILL LANGUAGE SPOKEN IS NOT ENGLISH AND IT AND IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT 5% OF THE- INDIVIDUALS. CONTACTING THAT PARTICULAR STATE AGENCY THAT STATE AGENCY HAS TO HELP EITHER INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE AND THAT PARTICULAR LANGUAGE OR HAVE YOU KNOW CONTRACTED FOR THOSE SERVICES. SO EDT I THINK WOULD FALL EASILY WELL WITH CENTER EDT IS RESPONSIBLE UNDER THIS ACT AGENCIES HAVE TO TRACK. OF THE LANGUAGES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTACT THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY AND AGAIN IF IT'S ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WHEN WE'VE CONDUCTED THOSE AUDITS IN THE PAST. WOULD NOT ONLY. MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT AGENCIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT THERE'S ALSO BEST PRACTICES AS FAR AS HAVING MATERIALS EITHER ON YOUR WEBSITE OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE DISTRIBUTING THROUGH THE MAIL. IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO THAT YOUR YOUR SERVING AS MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AS POSSIBLE SO THERE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU DEEP ALREADY DOES HAVE. UNDER UNTIMELY ALLEN TORY. SO YES FOLLOWING THAT UP I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD IMPRESS UPON V. D. TO INSTITUTE THE BEST PRACTICES OBVIOUSLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY'S BEEN IMPACTED IN MY DISTRICT SIGNIFICAN ARMENIAN AMERICAN POPULATION- WITH TWO DIALECTS. OF ARMENIAN I MEAN THE EASIER WE MAKE THIS THE TRANSLATION PORTHOLE OF MORE SERVICES WE CAN GET OUT QUICKLY SO AGAIN THAT'S A STRONG URGENT. FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE SHARED AS WELL- THE FRO- JUST TWO COMMENTS QUICKLY THE ID ME PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN ALL OF THE CONSTITUENTS SERVICES WE'RE DOING PLEASE- IMPROVE THAT WITH GREAT HASTE THE FROZEN ACCOUNTS THOSE THAT ARE LEGITIMATE I'M SORRY B. OF A IS LEFT THE CALL. BUT THE LEGITIMATE ACCOUNT ACCOUNTS NEED TO BE UNFROZEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OF THE TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF FRAUD HOW MUCH OF THAT ARE WE GOING TO GET BACK AND WHAT. WHAT PROCESSES BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO GO AFTER THE RETURN OF THAT MONEY TO THE STATE AND ARE THERE REFERRALS FOR PROSECUTION IF THERE WERE YOU KNOW MASSIVE FRAUD. CONSPIRACIES OUT THERE SO HOW WE GETTING THAT MONEY BACK INTO WE GOING AFTER THE FOR ALL THE FRAUD PERPETRATORS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MINISTER RECKLESS JUST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR DID WAS PROVIDE FUNDS TO FIND D. A. INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS MATTER WE OURSELVES HAVE CONDUCTED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DESTINATIONS. WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT ARRESTS. THAT'S GREAT AND HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY WE'RE GONNA GET BACK YOU THINK. OF THE TEN POINT FOUR WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK AS MUCH MONEY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN ALL RIGHT I DON'T WANT TO GO SIDEWAYS WITH YOU BUT I AGREE WITH YOU LET'S GET IT ALL BACK. THOSE ARE MY SHORT QUESTIONS AND AGAIN I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES TODAY THIS IS IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU IN THE OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY IN THE PARTNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO'S. MAN YES- SO I JUST WANTED FIRST REITERATE. THE CONCERNS RAISED AROUND CALL CENTERS- AND JUST ECHOED THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES- JUST TO GIVE YOU ARE DISTRICT OFFICES PERSPECTIVE. ALMOST ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CALLING IN OUR OFFICE. HAVE TOLD THEM THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE GETTING A HOLD OF A LIVE PERSON AT EDT. THEY'RE ON HOLD FOR HOURS AT A TIME SOMETIMES ALL DAY. ONE CALLER LAST WEEK BROKE DOWN AND CRIED TO OUR DISTRICT OFFICE WHEN SHE ACTUALLY TALKED TO SOMEONE AND SAID. GOD BLESS YOU AND EVERYONE THAT WORKS IN YOUR OFFICE. THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ANSWER THE PHONE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THAT MEANS. I APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS THAT THIS PARTICULAR- EDT LEADERSHIP IS PUTTING ON CALL CENTERS AND STANDING THEM UP. BUT JUST TO RELAY THIS A FEW DATA POINTS THIS IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO ASK FIRST ABOUT. THE FEDERAL STIMULUS THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM PROGRAM. I JUST GIVE YOU ANOTHER ANECDOTE WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO. HAD TO FOLD UP THE SHOP TO THE PANDEMIC. HI HE QUALIFIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS UNDER THE ORIGINAL P. WAY PROGRAM- BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO EVEN THOUGH HE QUALIFIED. FOR THE PHASE TWO EXTENSIONS OF THAT. HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH. HI WE HE'S TOLD I THINK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THAT QUALIFIES FOR THE FACE TO BENEFITS. THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS STARTING MARCH SEVENTH. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY LONG TIME HE'S GONNA BE GOING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THREE MONTHS WITHOUT BENEFITS. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THE RELEASE OF THESE FUNDS TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS PARTICULAR CONSTITUENT. I THINK THIS DRESS FOR NINETY YES YES MY UNDERSTANDING. ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH GETTING PEOPLE THEIR MONEY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IS THERE TO CREATE A TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE A DUTY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO CALL HOME MORE. HEARING ITSELF A PART OF OUR OUR BODIES PROGRAMS. GETTING A PEGS TO THE CLIENTS OUR OUR TOPPRIORITY. SO- WE HAVE GOTTEN OUT. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE LAST MONTH AND DINNER YOU KNOW WHO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM WORKED THAT THE WOMEN GOING TO BE IMPEDIMENTS ARE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE- ABOUT SUPPORTING THEIR ELIGIBILITY MARCH SEVENTH HOW DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER- ALL OPTIONS IN YOUR- THIS IS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS AND IT'S LIKE IN BETWEEN PROGRAMMING- THINK YOU'RE A WILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE GAPS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS- WE UNDERTOOK THIS HUGE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IN A PHASED APPROACH. WE'VE STRIPPED EVERYTHING THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY AREA HAS BEEN WORKING ON TO ALLOW THIS TO BE THE ONLY POINT OF FOCUS AND IF WE CAN GET IT IN ANY SOONER YOU FOLKS WILL BE THE FIRST TO HEAR- WE ARE CONTACTING THE- CLAIMANTS THIS WEEK TO. JUST HEADS UP AN ALERT BUT AGAIN THAT'S ANTICIPATION OF THE MARCH SEVENTH ST. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK WE CONTINUE TO ASK HIM IF WE FIND ANY CAPACITY WHATSOEVER IT WILL COME IN SOONER BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME HONEST ASSESSMENT IS MARCH THE SEVENTH. I APPRECIATE THAT- JUST FOR PURPOSES THE TIME I WON'T FOLLOW UP WITH A QUESTION BUT I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE STATE IN THIS PARTICULAR GENTLEMAN IS HOMELESS. HE'S BEEN LIVING IN A TENT FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS. FIRST OF ALL I ANY HELP TO TARGET HOMELESS OR NEAR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. OUT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED WE HEAR FROM A LOT OF FOLKS. ARE THAT HAVE TROUBLE ACCESSING PHONES TROUBLE ACCESSING EMAILS OR WEBSITES. THEY DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY MUCH IN THIS DESPERATE SITUATION- ANY HELP FOR THEM WOULD BE APPRECIATED AND THEN. AND YOU KNOW I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY EFFORTS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THE FRAUD THAT WE SAW WITH THE ORIGINAL P. WAY WHICH IS WHERE I UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE FRAUD TOOK PLACE BOB MY LAST STATEMENT IS AGAIN NOT A QUESTION UNFORTUNATELY BE OF A LAUGHED I WILL FOLLOW UP ON THIS WITH THE LATTER BUT ONE THING I WOULD POINT OUT BANK OF AMERICA HAS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO GIVE OVER DETAILS OF HOW MUCH COMPENSATION TO RECEIVE FROM THIS CONTRACT WITH THE STATE- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT I'M ASSUMING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO IMPLEMENT BASIC SECURITY PROTOCOLS. I LIKE CHIPS AND OTHER SECURITY PROTOCOLS THAT WERE ABSENT FROM THESE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE PRESENT ON OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS INCLUDING MY BANK ACCOUNT SAVINGS AND CHECKING- CERTAINLY PRIVATE WEALTH ACCOUNTS AND OTHER TYPES OF ACCOUNTS I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THOSE TYPES OF ACCOUNTS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FRAUD TO ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THIS DEGREE- I THINK WHAT WE SAW HERE WITH BANK OF AMERICA SYSTEMATIC UNDER INVESTMENT IN ITS SECURITY PROTOCOLS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AKIN TO ITS FAILURES AHEAD OF THE SUBPRIME CRISIS THE LAST CRISIS WE FACE. WHEN THEY WERE TAKING SHORT TERM GAINS AND THEN SUFFERING LONG TERM COSTS HI THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE THE LEVEL FRONT WE SAW IS UNIQUE TO THIS AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THOSE LEVELS ARE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NATIONWIDE AND NOT LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA I WOULD ALSO BE CURIOUS AND BANKAMERICA COULD RESPOND TO ME ON THIS IF YOU ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR FEDERAL REGULATORS ABOUT THE MATERIAL RISKS POSED BY YOUR FAILURES TO INVEST IN SECURITY PROTOCOLS. AROUND THESE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE POGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'M SORRY WHAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET AN ANSWER FOR THAT I DEEPLY NOTED I WOULD SUGGEST I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER ABOUT A BARB BY WE ALL FALL UNDER THE LETTER ARE BANKING CHAIR US AND IT'D PROBABLY IT'LL IF WE COULD SUBMIT QUESTIONS TO YOU TO THEN SENT INTO- AND GET THE ANSWERS FROM BANK OF AMERICA SO- ANYTHING LIKE THAT DON'T BRING THEM UP TODAY. BUT- GET HIM OVER TO SENATOR CO A YEAR OF. WE HAVE MEN. BEFORE WE GET EVEN. AND WE HAVE NOT TAKEN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO. PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE OF EACH OF THE- REMAINING SENATORS SO THAT.

I'M NOT EARLY BACK EARLIER THAN EXPECTED OR NEEDED. I HAD A QUESTION FOR BOTH EDT AND OUR BANK OF AMERICA AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT. WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN'T HAVE IT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IF A POSSIBLE WAY FOR- FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COME IN IN PERSON AND PROVED THAT IDENTITY- WITH REGARD TO GETTING THEIR BENEFITS- THAT IS ONE QUESTION. NUMBER TWO- BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW IS HE PLANNING ON EXPEDITIOUSLY ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD THEIR IDENTITY STOLEN INTERFACING. INTERFACING AND EXPECTED TAX LIABILITY WITH WILL EDT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS JUST ITS VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT TO ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE PROPER ASSISTANCE AND AVOID TAX LIABILITIES FOR BENEFITS THEY NEVER RECEIVED AND FURTHER IS EIGHTY PER TO RESPOND TO VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT WHO RECEIVED INCORRECT TAX FORMS.
