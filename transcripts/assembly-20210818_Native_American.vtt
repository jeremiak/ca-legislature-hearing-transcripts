01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:19.001
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO AS

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:22.137
ADVOCATES. THAT'S NOT IN OUR

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.138

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:24.773
SOMETHING THAT WE DO AS

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.509
TRADITIONAL PROTOCOLS. BUT IT'S

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.211
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.012

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:31.646
WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:32.647

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.400
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:52.968
TO DRESS THE HISTORICAL TRAUMA

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.603
THAT'S HAPPENED FOR A

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.170
CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE IN

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.873
CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT

IS THIS IS HAPPENED THROUGHOUT

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:07.682
CALIFORNIA WITHIN EVEN THE

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.785
MISSION SYSTEM IN SAN FRANCISCO

I LIVE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:14.022
NOT FAR FROM ONE OF THOSE.

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:17.259
CHURCHES THAT WAS THERE AND I

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:17.859
KNOW THERE ARE RELATIVES THAT

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.662
ARE BURIED THERE. THIS WORK IS

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:23.632
VERY PERSONAL. JESSICA DIED IN

AN INVESTIGATION THEY DETERMINE

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.018
THAT A STATE CRIME HAS. HAS

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.120
OCCURRED THEY CAN DETAIN AND

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.488
THEN TURN THAT SERVICE OVER TO

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.522
THE PROPER AUTHORITY BUT THEY

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:32.460
STILL BEING DEBATED- UP TO THAT

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.561
COURT DECISION THAT THEY DID

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.162

NATIVE AMERICAN THEY HAD TO LET

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:42.303
HIM GO SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:44.038
ARE CONTINUES TO BE DEBATED IN

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:47.608

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:49.610
STATE SO. ALSO JURISDICTION IS

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:50.511
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:54.748
ALWAYS AN ISSUE ON TRIBAL LAND-

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.183
TRIBAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.118
BEEN GROWING THROUGHOUT THE

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:59.253
STATE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW YOU

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.955
KNOW CRIME IS IT GET ANY BETTER

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:03.424
AND- SO TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:04.825
FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:06.894
DO SOMETHING. OUT OF THE EIGHT

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:07.895
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.331
HUMBLE COUNTY I HAVE- FOR

DEPARTMENTS. OUT OF THE EIGHT.

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.376
BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS ONE OF

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.978
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES ON TRIBAL

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:27.481
LAND- AND OUT OF THE AIDS I

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:28.349
THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.484
ONLY ONE HAS CLASS ACCESS

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.485

ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:33.988
SYSTEM THAT'S THE WAY THAT LAW

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:35.356
ENFORCEMENT CAN. COMMUNICATE

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:36.857
WITH EACH OTHER- AND TALKS

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.893
ABOUT MISSING PERSONS WANTED

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:40.227
PERSONS CRIMINAL HISTORY IN

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:42.096
THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND SO-

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:43.364
THAT'S THE ONE THING I WANT TO

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:44.165
BRING UP IN THE IN WILL DISCUSS

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.366
YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN. YOU KNOW

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:46.800
MOVE FORWARD BUT- JUST

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.669
INTERESTING THAT ONLY ONE OUT

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:51.705
OF EIGHT HAS THAT. SO AS AS AS-

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:53.073
ONE FORTIES OR STAB US IN

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.308
TROUBLE POLICE DEPARTMENTS YOU

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.609

ACTUALLY SAY. ARE CERTIFIED

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:03.951
RECRUITS TO TRAVEL OFFICERS

THAT HAVE GRADUATED THROUGH

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:05.920
POST CERTIFIED POLICE

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:08.289
ACADEMIES- AND THAT'S THE CASE

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:10.558
HERE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AND

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.159
MANY OF THESE TRIBES THROUGHOUT

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:13.727
THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY GOING

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:14.995

FEDERAL CERTAIN FEDERAL CRIMES

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:28.075
ON TRIBAL LAND. AND SO THAT'S

01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:29.476
THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BECOME

01:37:29.543 --> 01:37:31.312
FEDERAL PEACE OFFICERS AND

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:32.546
TRAVEL OFFICERS. SO THEY CAN

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.815

POTENTIALLY VIOLATING A STATE

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:52.366

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:54.368
THAT DETENTION OVER TO THE

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:33.840
WHY COULD WE DO THAT THAT'S

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:34.675

HAS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER MUCH

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:53.827
OF THE LANDS IN CALIFORNIA WERE

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:56.162
A NATIVE LANDS AND- THROUGH THE

COURSE OF TIME- THROUGH

01:48:57.998 --> 01:48:58.798
TERMINATION I'LL GIVE A LITTLE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.200
BIT OF BACKGROUND ON OUR TRIBE

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:02.469
SPECIFICALLY. BUT THOSE PLANS

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.137
ARE NO LONGER WITHIN TRIBES

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:08.008
CONTROL AND THEREFORE- THE

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:10.644
EVIDENCE OF OUR EXISTENCE- IS

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:13.280
IN THE GROUND AND SO WHEN WE

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:15.081
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:17.250
CONTROL AND PRESERVE SOME OF

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:19.753
THOSE. ARTIFACTS IT BECOMES AN

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:22.188
ISSUE FOR TRIBES BECAUSE IT'S

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:23.690
CULTURALLY AND HISTORICALLY

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:25.992
IMPORTANT FOR US- THAT THOSE

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:29.262
ITEMS REMAIN IN THE GROUND AND-

01:49:29.329 --> 01:49:30.463

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.434
PROGRESS HERE BUT- OFTENTIMES

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:37.137
THAT ENDS UP BEING- IMPACTFUL

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:39.806
TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHEN ARE.

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:42.275
THE EVIDENCE OF OUR EXISTENCE

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:43.443
IT IS EXPLOITED OR OR TAKEN.

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:48.081

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:52.919
BEAUTIFUL AREA VERY VERY SMALL

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:55.088
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ALSO THE

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:58.224
POOREST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA-

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:02.128

OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THAT'S

01:50:10.236 --> 01:50:12.005
THE BLOODY ISLAND MASSACRE. OUR

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:14.207
TRIBE WAS FIRST RECOGNIZED IN

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:15.909

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:19.312
EVENTUALLY AMASSED ABOUT FIVE

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:20.714
HUNDRED SIX SIXTY ACRES-

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.182
HISTORICALLY THAT BECAME OUR

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:25.552
TRIBAL LANDS- UNFORTUNATELY IN

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:26.252
THE EIGHTEEN IN THE NINETEEN

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:28.254

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:33.159
FEDERAL RECOGNITION AND OUR

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.595
GOVERNMENT- AS A RESULT OF THE

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.063
ASSETS OF THE TRIBE AT THAT

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:41.101
TIME BEANLAND- IT WAS DIVVIED

UP AMONGST ARE RECOGNIZED

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.138
MEMBERS AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:46.840
LAND COMES OUT OF TRUSTED INTO

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.742
FEET SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND-

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:51.077
OUR- PEOPLE WERE HISTORICALLY

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:53.346
IMPOVERISHED AND COULD NOT

01:50:53.413 --> 01:50:53.980
AFFORD THE TAXES STILL THE LAND

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:58.485
WAS LOST- IN. IN THE EARLY TWO

01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:00.086
THOUSANDS WE ATTEMPTED TO

01:51:00.153 --> 01:51:01.521
REESTABLISH OUR GOVERNMENT BUT

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.690
IN ORDER TO REGAIN OUR

01:51:03.757 --> 01:51:05.425
RECOGNITION WE HAD TO SUE THE

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.194
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN NINETEEN

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:08.695
SEVENTY AND WE WANT OUR

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:11.264
LAWSUIT- AND THE LAWSUIT

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.366
BASICALLY SAID THAT ARE. THAT

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.536
WE HAD EXISTED AS A GOVERNMENT

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:18.905
AND WE WERE NEVER- NOT A

01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:20.907
GOVERNMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:23.243
OUR LAND WAS LOST AT THAT TIME

01:51:23.309 --> 01:51:25.345
SO OUR TRIBE WAS LANDLESS UP

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:28.248
UNTIL THE EARLY- TWO THOUSAND

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:31.217

EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T ONET-

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:44.864
THAT STILL EXISTED IT BECOMES A

01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:47.867
VERY COMPLEX SITUATION WHERE

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:51.004
AND ONE OR TWO OR FIVE MEMBERS

IT IS IN TRUST BUT THE TRIBE AS

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.709
A GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HOLD

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.611
TRUST LANDS. IT'S VERY

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.880
COMPLICATED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.115
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:04.818
JURISDICTION OCCURS FOR THEM

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:07.454
AND WHERE IT DOESN'T- SO IT IT

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.289
BECAME A BIG ISSUE IN OUR

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:11.124
COMMUNITY THERE ARE SEVEN

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:12.926
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:15.662
LAKE COUNTY SEVERAL OF THEM

01:52:15.728 --> 01:52:18.031
WERE LANDLESS AS WELL- WE WERE

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.432
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RE

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:22.001
ESTABLISH A SMALL. LAND BASED

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:23.903
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:24.871
IT WAS FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:28.608
GAMING IT WAS OUR EXPERIENCE IN

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:33.113
THAT PROCESS THAT REALLY WAS A-

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:36.783
A TESTIMONY TO HOW GOVERNMENTS

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:41.020
CAN REESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS-

01:52:41.087 --> 01:52:43.356
FORTUNATELY FOR US- WE WERE

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:44.991
ABLE TO OVERCOME SOME OF THE

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:46.025
CHALLENGES IN OUR IN OUR

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:49.095
COMMUNITY- BUT- AS A RESULT. OF

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:52.165
OUR LANDLESS NIS- AND THE LACK

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:54.267
OF POLICE FORCE AND AT THAT

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:55.468
TIME A VERY YOUNG GOVERNMENT

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:58.104
WHICH- WE BASICALLY HAD A

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.205
CONSTITUTION AND ROMAN

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:00.807
ORDINANCE IN AN ETHICS

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:03.610
ORDINANCE AND- AND NOT MUCH

01:53:03.676 --> 01:53:07.547
MORE. WE RELIED SOLELY ON- THE

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:11.151
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR- FOR

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:14.053
OUR PROTECTION- UNFORTUNATELY

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.189
ALSO BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORY OUR

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:18.324
PEOPLE AND MANY OF THE TRIBES

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:20.994
IN THE AREA. ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.929
GOVERNMENT AND THAT INCLUDED

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:26.533
LAW ENFORCEMENT- TODAY HOWEVER.

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.969
WITH OUR MODERN GOVERNMENT WE-

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.371
AS A RESULT OF BEING LANDLESS

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.505
HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:34.040
OF TRYING TO ACQUIRE TO PUT I

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:35.708
IN TRUST AND IN THAT TIME IT

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:37.911
WAS FOR A GAMING. OPPORTUNITY

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:42.715
BUT OUR- OUR SOUL- OUR SOLE

01:53:42.782 --> 01:53:44.784
EFFORT WAS REALLY TO FOCUS ON

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.786
WORKING WITH THE COUNTY TO

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.655
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THAT-

01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:50.323
POTENTIAL CASINO IN THE

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:52.859
COMMUNITY- WE DID THAT THROUGH

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:54.894
NEGOTIATING- A GOVERNMENT TO

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.596
GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP. AN

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:59.365
MOU- IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE

01:53:59.432 --> 01:54:02.101
SO IS VERY SOON AFTER OUR

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.970
GOVERNMENT WAS RE ESTABLISHED.

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:06.206
THAT PARLAYED INTO CONSIDERABLE

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:08.575
SUPPORT BY THE COMMUNITY WHEN

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:09.976
WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE TRUST

01:54:10.043 --> 01:54:12.178
PROCESS TRYING TO PUT OUR LAND

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:14.414
INTO TRUST- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.516
ONLY ABLE TO REESTABLISH ELEVEN

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:19.118
ACRES. SO WE DON'T HAVE YOU

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:21.554
KNOW A LOT LARGE TRIBAL LAND

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:24.257
BASE ANYMORE- BUT IT WAS

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:26.226
THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS- WITH

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:28.161
WORKING WITH THE COUNTY- NOR

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:30.163
SURE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.531
FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:33.800
ESTABLISHING AN MO YOU FOR FIRE

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.001
PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:37.470
SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR LAW

01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:39.505
ENFORCEMENT. REALLY WAS AN EYE

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:42.008
OPENER FOR US AS TO THE RIGHT

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:44.043
WAY TO DO THINGS- I THINK IT

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:45.712
REALLY ESTABLISHED A GOOD

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:47.513
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.748
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:50.783
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND THAT

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:53.219
HELPED US ALONG- YOU KNOW OVER

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:54.787
THE COURSE OF TIME.

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:56.422
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THOUGH WE

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:58.591
MET PRETTY REGULARLY WITH

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:01.194
COUNTY OFFICIALS AND- AT NORTH

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:03.296
SHORE FIRE PROTECTION. THAT DID

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:07.267
NOT A IT WASN'T A PANACEA. I AM

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:11.037
FORTUNATELY IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.138
FOURTEEN. WE EXPERIENCED AN

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:15.208
ISSUE OF STAGING IN WHAT WAS

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:17.677

SERVICES DID NOT REALIZE THAT.

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:26.452
THAT THOSE PLANS WERE NOT IN

01:55:26.519 --> 01:55:29.088
TRUST. BUT IT RESULTED IN THE

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:32.792
STAGING INCIDENT WHERE.

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.527
EMERGENCY SERVICE RESPONDERS

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:36.696
WOULD NOT COME OUT TO WHAT THEY

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:37.864
DEEMED AS OUR RESERVATION

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.066
BECAUSE OF- A RECENT ISSUE THAT

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.868
THEY HAD HAD AN OR- IN A RECENT

01:55:41.934 --> 01:55:45.505

INFORM US OF THE ISSUE. AND AS

01:55:49.509 --> 01:55:51.277
A RESULT OF DELAY OF EMERGENCY

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:53.646

UPROAR WITH OUR OUR OUR OUR

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:09.095
PEOPLE. AND A LOT OF CHALLENGES

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:10.863
FOR US AS A GOVERNMENT- BECAUSE

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:13.299

SEVERAL MEETINGS WHICH RESULTED

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:26.779
AND THE- THE AGENCY. DEVELOPING

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:29.315
A STAGING POLICY THERE IS A

01:56:29.382 --> 01:56:31.284
CALLING PROTOCOL IN PLACE NOW

01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:34.153

CALL IF THERE'S EVER AN ISSUE

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.256

HAD A STAGING ISSUE AT ALL. BUT

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:49.736
IT REMINDED US THAT EVEN WITH

01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:51.504
THEM OF USE THAT WASN'T ENOUGH

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:53.172
WE HAD TO DO MORE AND

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:54.640
UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN WITH OUR

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.609
COMMUNITY BEING VERY POOR IT

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.211

THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD GONE

01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:20.359
THROUGH THE RECENT TRAINING.

01:58:20.426 --> 01:58:22.228
DID NOT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:24.397

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:04.962
NOT HAVE THESE COMMUNICATIONS

EXPERIENCE AT A VERY HIGH

02:26:39.056 --> 02:26:40.525
LEVEL. IF YOU SEE IT IN

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:41.893
CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:43.594
NOT CONSIDERED A VIOLENT CRIME.

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:45.563
THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE.

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:47.965
CHAMPIONING A CHILD FOR SEX. IS

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:48.900
NOT CONSIDERED A LOT OF CRIME

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:51.435
OR THE PEOPLE OF. HATE CRIMES

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:53.638
WHICH WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL. IS

02:26:53.704 --> 02:26:56.507
NOT CONSIDERED A LOT OF CRIME

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:57.074
IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE

02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:58.576
WHICH IS NONSENSICAL IN MY

02:26:58.643 --> 02:26:59.977
OPINION OBVIOUSLY IF YOU COMMIT

02:27:00.044 --> 02:27:01.646
THESE CRIMES. ELIGIBLE FOR

02:27:01.712 --> 02:27:03.047
EARLY RELEASE. UPON THE

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:04.048
TOUGHEST THING THEY SHOULD HAVE

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:05.449
TALKED ABOUT FOLKS TALKED ABOUT

02:27:05.516 --> 02:27:08.319
WERE MISSING PERSONS. AND IT'S-

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:09.921
MISSING PERSON CASES ARE TOUGH

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:11.389
NUMBER ONE. BECAUSE IN THE VAST

02:27:11.455 --> 02:27:13.591
MAJORITY CASES. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:14.525
WILL NOT GO OUT THERE TO LOOK

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:17.962
FOR THAT PERSON. A LESSER RISK

02:27:18.029 --> 02:27:18.863
OR MAYBE UNDER THE AGE OF

02:27:18.930 --> 02:27:20.464
TWELVE. BUT THEY RECEIVE SO

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:22.600
MANY MISSING PERSON CASES. AND

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.468
LAW ENFORCEMENT SO INUNDATED.

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:25.903
OTHER THE INTERNET GETTING

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:27.438

NATIONWIDE SYSTEM. THAT'S

02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.777
PRETTY MUCH IT BECAUSE YOU

02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:34.212
DON'T INVESTIGATE MISSING

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:37.014
PERSON CASES SO IT'S TOUGH

02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:37.548

DON'T FOR THE MOST EVERYBODY.

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:48.693
THIS WILL SIMPLE THINGS YOU

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:49.727
TAKE MISSING PERSON CASES EVERY

02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:51.896
