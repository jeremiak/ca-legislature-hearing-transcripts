PERCENT PSH.

00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:39.404 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT WILL MOVE ALONG

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.906 region:rollup2
WELL BECAUSE LOS ANGELES HAS

00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:43.408 region:rollup2
ADOPTED STREAMLINING FOR OF

PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:46.878 region:rollup2
AND WE FIGURED THAT THAT'LL SAVE

US PROBABLY ONE TO TWO YEARS.

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:51.516 region:rollup2
ON THAT PROJECT.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.818 region:rollup2
WHENEVER WE ARE LOOKING AT A

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SITE FOR. PERMANENT

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:57.055 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OF COURSE WE

LOCATION THINGS LIKE THAT A BUT

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:03.028 region:rollup2
WE ALSO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:04.529 region:rollup2
LOCAL SUPPORT AND AND POSSIBLE

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:07.165 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT AND.

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:08.600 region:rollup2
IF WE DO SEE THAT NEIGHBORS ARE.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:09.768 region:rollup2
REALLY OPPOSED IN REALLY WELL

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.169 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED AND SOMETIMES WILL

00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:12.303 region:rollup2
BACK OFF AND NOT DO THE PROJECT

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:14.839 region:rollup2
AT ALL.

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:15.573 region:rollup2
BUT MORE TYPICALLY WILL STICK

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.709 region:rollup2
WITH IT.

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:19.444 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:21.579 region:rollup2
IT'LL COST US ANOTHER YEAR OR

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:23.281 region:rollup2
TWO OF THE PROJECT WHICH MAKES

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:25.216 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:27.085 region:rollup2
IT'S

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:28.987 region:rollup2
LESS EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF USING

00:36:27.085 --> 00:36:30.021 region:rollup2
THE PROPER TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:31.623 region:rollup2
ALSO AT LEAST PEOPLE ON THE

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.057 region:rollup2
STREETS LAWYER.

00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:34.125 region:rollup2
SO.

00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:35.393 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WOULD

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:37.195 region:rollup2
HELP US IN SEVERAL WAYS WHO

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:38.630 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE THE PROJECTS MORE

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:41.032 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE AND MORE PREDICTABLE.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:43.001 region:rollup2
IT WOULD MAKE MORE SITES

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.468 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO US FOR THAT PURPOSE

00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.136 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:46.838 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MAKE PROJECTS MORE

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:48.406 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.141 region:rollup2
BY ELIMINATING WHAT WE CALL

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:51.743 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENT RISK.

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.411 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN TALK TO

00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:55.413 region:rollup2
LENDERS AND INVESTORS AND

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:56.481 region:rollup2
THEY'LL COME ON BOARD SOONER AND

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.782 region:rollup2
WITH MORE MONEY.

00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:58.750 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE SURE THAT THE

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.218 region:rollup2
PROJECT WILL.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.620 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:04.522 region:rollup2
SO IF WE HAVE THIS IN PLACE

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.124 region:rollup2
THEN WE CAN USE LOCAL FUNDS WE

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:08.359 region:rollup2
CAN USE THE UPCOMING STATE PHONE

00:37:06.124 --> 00:37:09.594 region:rollup2
FUNDS. WE CAN USE NO PLACE LIKE

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:11.296 region:rollup2
HOME FUNDS THERE'S A LOT OF

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:13.932 region:rollup2
MONEY GOING TO PSH.

00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:15.400 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALL STEP UP AND AND GET

IT DONE A A LOT FASTER.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.903 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD ALSO HELP LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THEIR RENO

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.440 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS.

00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:24.409 region:rollup2
TO CLEAN UP THEIR STREETS AND

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
ALSO IT WOULD FREE LOCAL ELECTED

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:27.946 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS FROM HAVING TO TAKE

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:30.014 region:rollup2

00:58:15.092 --> 00:58:18.862 region:rollup2
DICTATING AND RECIPE FORM HOW

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.330 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TO DO

00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:22.132 region:rollup2
THEIR JOB AND AGREEMENT THAT

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.233 region:rollup2
REMAINS A CONSERVE. AS WELL AS

00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:25.135 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:27.437 region:rollup2
DISCREPANCIES IN THE LIST OF

00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:28.872 region:rollup2
BANNED ITEMS FOR INSTANCE THERE

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:30.307 region:rollup2
MAY BE SOME ITEMS THAT ARE IN

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:32.743 region:rollup2
THAT BAND LIST. THAT.

00:58:30.307 --> 00:58:34.177 region:rollup2
A CITIZEN CAN GO TO OF MILITARY

00:58:32.743 --> 00:58:36.146 region:rollup2
SURPLUS STORE AND ACTUALLY

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.346 region:rollup2
PURCHASE THEMSELF.

00:58:36.146 --> 00:58:40.384 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:41.418 region:rollup2
OTHER AND IN OTHER ITEMS WHERE

00:58:40.384 --> 00:58:42.853 region:rollup2
A LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY

00:58:41.418 --> 00:58:44.821 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY GO TO A THIRD

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:46.390 region:rollup2
PARTY VENDOR. AND PURCHASE IT

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:48.125 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE REVIEW PROCESS

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.359 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY CALLING FOR

00:58:48.125 --> 00:58:52.095 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT COMING

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:53.830 region:rollup2
FROM A MILITARY A TRANSFER FROM

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:54.998 region:rollup2

THAT WAY AND.

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:02.072 region:rollup2

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:04.174 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE LISTED ITEMS THAT

00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:05.542 region:rollup2
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE OF USE SO

00:59:04.174 --> 00:59:06.610 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:08.311 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

THIS

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:36.506 region:rollup2
CITY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF

.

00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:40.744 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE PURCHASES WERE

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:42.079 region:rollup2

DECISIONS.

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:47.217 region:rollup2
.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:49.052 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE INFORMATION WERE

00:59:47.217 --> 00:59:51.621 region:rollup2
GIVEN SOME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:53.457 region:rollup2
THE. THE ISSUE ABOUT HAVING TO

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:55.225 region:rollup2
ACT QUICKLY MAYBE THAT.

00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:57.394 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS HAS CHANGED

00:59:55.225 --> 00:59:58.562 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ACCESSING. THIS

00:59:57.394 --> 01:00:00.831 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT ABOUT.

00:59:58.562 --> 01:00:02.265 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY HAD NO PROBLEM.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.767 region:rollup2
SAID IT AGENDA ICING SOMETHING

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:05.335 region:rollup2
WE MET EVERY WEEK SO IF THERE

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.903 region:rollup2
WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:08.638 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT. UP THE POLICE

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:10.207 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT USUALLY I THOUGHT DID

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:11.641 region:rollup2
A PRETTY THOROUGH AND THOROUGH

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.076 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS AND CAME TO US WITH

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:14.478 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE AND WE WERE ABLE TO

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.745 region:rollup2
HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON IT SO

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:17.514 region:rollup2
IT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:19.049 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE I

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.884 region:rollup2
WANT YOU TO JUST THINK ABOUT AND

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:22.085 region:rollup2
I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS

01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:23.386 region:rollup2
TODAY BECAUSE I AM OUT I I AGREE

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:25.422 region:rollup2
THAT TIME.

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:26.690 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.858 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN OUR

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.726 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:30.927 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE POLICE

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.863 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT PARTICIPATE.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:36.133 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:38.101 region:rollup2
AYE I AM IT IS. INTRIGUING TO

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:39.870 region:rollup2
MEDIA USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:40.437 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOOK AT THAT

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.738 region:rollup2
AND TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S A

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:42.973 region:rollup2
WAIT OF MER.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.708 region:rollup2
WHITE WAS ABOUT.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.810 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.410 region:rollup2
ORDER I I DON'T HAVE ANY FROM ME

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.645 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.845 region:rollup2
BE DIFFERENT.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.514 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:51.781 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THAT

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:53.817 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE THAT THERE'S SOME

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:56.153 region:rollup2
OVERLAP THERE THAT MIGHT BE AND

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:57.053 region:rollup2
A WAY TO GO BUT I. I I THINK YOU

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.388 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:00.624 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:02.859 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION FOR US TO HAVE. AND.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:04.294 region:rollup2
I THINK ALL OF US WANT OUR

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:06.263 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICERS TO BE TREATED

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:07.531 region:rollup2
WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT AND PART

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:08.532 region:rollup2
OF THAT RESPECT IS IS WORKING

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:09.599 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMUNITY IN HAVING THE

01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:11.168 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.769 region:rollup2
STAKE IN THE MATTER AS WELL SO.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.004 region:rollup2
BUT I BUT I AM I AM I AM

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:15.071 region:rollup2
COGNIZANT OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.940 region:rollup2
WERE RAISED HERE TODAY SO I'M

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:19.075 region:rollup2
GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY AND WE'LL

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.610 region:rollup2
SEE HOW IT PROGRESSES.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.178 region:rollup2
THEN SHARED IT IS HELPFUL TO THE

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.213 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.848 region:rollup2
DE EVA BUT IT RAN FROM A CELL

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.782 region:rollup2
USE HERE SHE CAN SPEAK TO THE

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.751 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF THE CONTRACTS FOR THE

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:29.419 region:rollup2
OBAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER I THINK IT

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:30.487 region:rollup2
IS LESS THAN WHAT WAS PUT ARE

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:33.490 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED BY THE OPPONENTS.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:34.357 region:rollup2
NOTIFYING PLEASE GO PROCEED VERY

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:36.159 region:rollup2
MUCH ON.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.427 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS THIS THIS.

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BILL DOES IN FACT NEAR

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.163 region:rollup2
THE OBAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IN

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.598 region:rollup2
IN SEVERAL RESPECTS IT DIFFERS

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.999 region:rollup2
ONE IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT THE

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:44.634 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE ORDER ACTUALLY HAD A

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:46.336 region:rollup2
CATEGORY OF BAND EQUIPMENT THAT

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:48.371 region:rollup2
WAS BANNED ALTOGETHER. THIS

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:49.839 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BILL DOES NOT MAKE THAT

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.974 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BUT RATHER IMPOSES

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.908 region:rollup2
THIS PROCEDURE FOR POTENTIALLY

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:53.710 region:rollup2
ACQUIRING.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.644 region:rollup2
THIS MILITARY EQUIPMENT WITHOUT

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DISTINCTION OF

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.413 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S BANNED OR NOT SO IN

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.547 region:rollup2
THAT SENSE IT'S A BIT MORE

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.515 region:rollup2
PERMISSIVE TOWARD LAW

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.783 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT EVEN THEN THE

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:01.284 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE ORDER.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.752 region:rollup2
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF COURSE

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:04.487 region:rollup2
DIDN'T IMPOSE A SPECIFIC LOCAL

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:05.255 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PROCEDURE FOR

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:07.057 region:rollup2

ACQUISITION OF THIS EQUIPMENT.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.096 region:rollup2
UP IT DID SORT OF SET SAFEGUARDS

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:15.231 region:rollup2
IN PLACE THAT HAD TO BE MET

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.733 region:rollup2

KNOW HE'S THE IS THE LEADER I

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:29.499 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IN THE IN THIS HOUSE I'M

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:31.934 region:rollup2
THAT'S PUSHING HOUSING

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:33.403 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.337 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE BILL'S CURLY DRAFTED

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:35.738 region:rollup2
WE WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE OUR

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.740 region:rollup2
PRIMARY OBJECTION IS THAT WE'RE

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:39.008 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE A CONSTITUTIONALLY

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.810 region:rollup2

GIVEN TO A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:46.416 region:rollup2
THEN WE BELIEVE THAT'S ACTION

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.451 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL BUT.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.619 region:rollup2
ARE YOU THE ASSUMPTION IS OF

01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:50.653 region:rollup2
THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS GOING TO

01:09:49.619 --> 01:09:51.888 region:rollup2
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AND IT'S

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:53.456 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:56.025 region:rollup2
DECISION IS THE BEST THING WE

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:56.592 region:rollup2
CAN GIVE OFFICE. AS THE INTO THE

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.493 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUIDELINES

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.928 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY

01:09:57.493 --> 01:10:00.363 region:rollup2
SEVEN GUIDELINES BART MADE IT

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.164 region:rollup2
REALLY CLEAR THAT THEIR BEST

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.932 region:rollup2
STATIONS.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:04.300 region:rollup2
REALLY COME AT THE DEVELOPMENT

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:06.402 region:rollup2
COMES WE WORKS WITH THE LOCAL

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.171 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND IN A SENSE YOU

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.905 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS MEASURE WOULD WHAT

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:09.806 region:rollup2
ALMOST A FIVE THAT PLANE AND

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:11.741 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO PUT OF MY IN PLACE A

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.875 region:rollup2
PLAN AND AND NOW. THEY'RE GONNA

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:15.311 region:rollup2
SAY WELL YOU KNOW MAYBE CAN

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.812 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE PLAN AND YOU KNOW NOT

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.046 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WORK WITH LOCAL

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:18.915 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK IT'S

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.682 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.784 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:23.219 region:rollup2
BART GETS TO DICTATE BASICALLY

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:24.387 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ON THEIR PROPERTY NOW

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.054 region:rollup2
THE MINUTES TO HELP THEY JUST

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.722 region:rollup2
HER DOMINANCE HERE AROUND

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.324 region:rollup2
DESIGNERS YOU.

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:30.460 region:rollup2
BUT PARTS CAN BE THE ONE THAT'S

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:31.594 region:rollup2
GONNA DICTATE THE RULES ON THEIR

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.329 region:rollup2
PROPERTY YES THIS IS ONLY YOU

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.996 region:rollup2
KNOW RELATED A BAR RIGHT NOW BUT

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.298 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK THAT EVERY SPECIAL

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:36.833 region:rollup2
DISHES EVERY TRANSIT HE SAID

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:38.067 region:rollup2
OWNS PROPERTY. IS GONNA WANT TO

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.235 region:rollup2
RUN OUT AND GET SIMILAR

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:41.104 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.671 region:rollup2
AND NOT HAVE TO WORK IN A

01:10:41.104 --> 01:10:43.139 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE AT THE LOCAL

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:44.507 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE OTHER

01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:45.842 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THE BILL TWO IS IT

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:47.376 region:rollup2
ALLOWS FOR S. B. THIRTY FIVE

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:49.078 region:rollup2
STREAMLINING WITHIN

JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE WILL

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.080 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.482 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.749 region:rollup2

OF S. B. THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR.

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:58.321 region:rollup2
WAS THAT IT IF CITIES CAN MAKE

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:59.155 region:rollup2
PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENA THEN THEY

01:10:58.321 --> 01:10:59.722 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THE

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:00.957 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED UNDER SB THIRTY

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.657 region:rollup2
FIVE.

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:02.892 region:rollup2
THIS IS REGARDLESS OF YOUR

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.360 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE PROGRESS OR NOT

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:06.429 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STREAMLINE

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.396 region:rollup2
UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE IF BART

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.898 region:rollup2
WANTS YOU TO DO IT.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:10.066 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY MEAN

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:11.667 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T KNOW SEQUEL.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.735 region:rollup2
ON THOSE SITES AND THERE

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:14.003 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:16.072 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:17.306 region:rollup2
WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:18.474 region:rollup2
OPPOSE.

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.842 region:rollup2

WE'D DO SUPPORT THE OPTIONS

THE STATION PLAN.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:43.332 region:rollup2

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:48.004 region:rollup2

SPECIAL DISTRICTS AYE I AM.

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:47.230 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THIS BILL

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.430 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.832 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.634 region:rollup2
.

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:54.070 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:55.438 region:rollup2
DECREED THAT WORK WE SHOULD BE

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:58.441 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:13:00.476 region:rollup2
TRANSIT IN TRANSIT MODALITIES

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:02.078 region:rollup2
TO MOVE PEOPLE.

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:03.880 region:rollup2
AND THE.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY'RE RESOURCES THAT

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.118 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE TOWARDS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:11.454 region:rollup2
LIGHT RAIL TRAINS. BART THOSE

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:13.022 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS AND.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:15.324 region:rollup2
THAT'S TERRIFIC BECAUSE IT MOVES

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.992 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BUT FRANKLY NONE OF THE

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.627 region:rollup2
MONEY GETS SPENT IN RURAL

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:18.794 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.162 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE SO

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.831 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT POPULATION TO

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:24.267 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT.

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:25.635 region:rollup2
SO I'M OKAY WITH IS TAKING ALL

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:27.036 region:rollup2
OF THIS MONEY NONE OF WHICH WILL

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.838 region:rollup2
GO TOWARDS RURAL CALIFORNIA AND

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:30.206 region:rollup2
PUT IT IN THE CITIES. BUT

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.707 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A PROMISE MADE IN

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:33.209 region:rollup2
THE PROMISES THAT AROUND THE

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.610 region:rollup2
TRANSIT.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.878 region:rollup2
STOPS THAT THERE WILL BE

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.547 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:39.482 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING SO

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.350 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BILL

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:43.119 region:rollup2
BENNETT BIG PARKING LOTS.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.754 region:rollup2
SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT DRIVING

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.988 region:rollup2
IN TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:47.189 region:rollup2
THEY WALK RIGHT OUTSIDE THEIR

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.890 region:rollup2
DOOR AND THEY CAN TAKE THE BUS

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.659 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN GET THEIR VERY

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:51.327 region:rollup2
EASILY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:54.363 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS RARELY HAPPENED

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:56.465 region:rollup2
AROUND TRANSIT STOPS AND IN

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:58.200 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. ON I THINK IT'S TRUE

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:59.068 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S GOING TO MOVE ON TO

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.037 region:rollup2
OTHERS TO WEATHER.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:02.805 region:rollup2
FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION IN

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:05.875 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AND NOW A.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:06.442 region:rollup2
WHERE AT THAT COUNCILS AROUND

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:08.678 region:rollup2
THE TRANSIT STOPS HAVE DOWNS

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:10.413 region:rollup2
OWN?

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:12.148 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY BECAUSE OF PUBLIC.

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:13.816 region:rollup2
PROTEST

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:15.484 region:rollup2
A PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE AND SO

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:16.786 region:rollup2
WE END UP.

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.020 region:rollup2
PUTTING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:19.789 region:rollup2
INTO THESE TRANSIT STOPS WITH

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.124 region:rollup2
THE PROMISE AND THE PROMISE

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:24.493 region:rollup2
NEVER COMES. TO PASS AND SO I BY

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:25.828 region:rollup2
A ON IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO GET

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:27.663 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WHICH IS TO KIND OF.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:30.032 region:rollup2
TAKE KIND OF TAKE OVER SOME OF

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:33.102 region:rollup2
THIS AYE AYE MAYBE NOT BUT I

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:34.937 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:36.872 region:rollup2
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT WHAT WHAT

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:38.808 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT IS

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:40.142 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE THAT BEFORE ANY.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:42.244 region:rollup2
STATE DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:43.879 region:rollup2
TRANSIT. THAT THERE HAS TO BE IN

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.581 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.616 region:rollup2
THEY SIGNED OFF ON INCREASING

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:49.352 region:rollup2
THE DENSITIES AND AND IF IN FACT

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.985 region:rollup2
THEY MOVED TO REDUCE DENSITIES

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.520 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.621 region:rollup2
BACK.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.823 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:55.291 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET THE DENSITY WE

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:57.693 region:rollup2
NEEDS AROUND THESE TRANSIT STOPS

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:59.128 region:rollup2
IT'S A WASTE OF. TAXPAYERS MONEY

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:01.030 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BROKEN

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:02.064 region:rollup2
PROMISE AND SO I'M I'M HOPING

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:04.100 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:06.068 region:rollup2
WITH. THE THE LOCALS BECAUSE I'M

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:08.537 region:rollup2
A BIG BELIEVER AND LOCAL CONTROL

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:10.139 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ABILITY TO CONTROL

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.273 region:rollup2
AND USED IN PARTICULAR AND I

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:12.208 region:rollup2
KNOW BOTH YOU COME FROM LOCAL

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:14.176 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:15.311 region:rollup2
SO. I'M IN SUPPORT THIS TODAY

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.679 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK IT'S

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:17.079 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:19.048 region:rollup2
AND.

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:20.416 region:rollup2
AND AND HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.851 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:24.320 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:26.756 region:rollup2
THAT IN FACT LOCALS ARE AT THE

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.757 region:rollup2
TABLE WORKING ON ON THESE KINDS

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.392 region:rollup2
OF PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN REALLY

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:31.093 region:rollup2
GET THE HOUSING THAT WE

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:33.362 region:rollup2
DESPERATELY NEED. SO THAT WERE

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:34.730 region:rollup2
NOT IMPACTING OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:37.633 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING HOUSING

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.701 region:rollup2
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:40.669 region:rollup2
IF I COULD JUST RESPOND FOR

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.737 region:rollup2
SECOND I REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:43.205 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND FIRST OF ALL OF

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:44.874 region:rollup2
COURSE OUR WE LOOK FOR TO

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.875 region:rollup2
CONTINUE OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.610 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABOUT THIS

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.844 region:rollup2
BILL AND. AND HOW CRAFT IS

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:51.347 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY BUT I THINK YOUR POINT

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:52.548 region:rollup2
IS EXTREMELY WELL TAKEN IF WE

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:54.550 region:rollup2
WERE DOING THIS TODAY.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.384 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD SAY THAT ANY

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.086 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION THAT'S GONNA

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.721 region:rollup2
RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT TRANSIT

01:15:57.086 --> 01:16:00.222 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO BUILD SOMETHING THE

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.991 region:rollup2
SCALE OF A PARK STATION. NEEDS

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.892 region:rollup2
TO COMMIT TO SMART GROWTH AND

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AROUND THAT

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
STATION AND IF IT WERE UP TO ME.

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:08.130 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD HAPPEN FORTY FIVE

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:09.165 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO BUT IT DIDN'T AND WHAT

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:11.033 region:rollup2
WE'RE FACED WITH AT THIS TIME

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:12.268 region:rollup2
ARE ARE ARE DOZENS OF STATIONS

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.202 region:rollup2
SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF ACRES

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:15.604 region:rollup2
OF PARKING LOTS.

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:16.839 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR I THINK TOO.

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.973 region:rollup2
TO THE REGION THAT'S

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.508 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING A HOUSING

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:21.043 region:rollup2
CONGESTION CRISIS AND IT'S NOT

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.577 region:rollup2
FAIR TO YOUR DISTRICT THAT

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.678 region:rollup2
DIDN'T RECEIVE THE TRANCE

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.112 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.814 region:rollup2
SO.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:26.816 region:rollup2
I HAD THOUGHT THAT IN THE BAY

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:28.751 region:rollup2
AREA WE OUGHT TOCONDITION FOR

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.385 region:rollup2
FUTURE FOR THE FUTURE ANY

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.687 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION THAT ONCE RECEIVED

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:32.955 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. HOUSE TO COMMIT BUT WE

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:35.091 region:rollup2
CAN'T UNRING THAT BELL AT THIS

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:37.560 region:rollup2
POINT BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:38.928 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT ON BART ON LANDS WE

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.929 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB. THAN

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.963 region:rollup2
JUST BUILDING PARKING LOTS BUT I

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.798 region:rollup2

UNLIKABLE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

01:17:55.938 --> 01:18:00.576 region:rollup2

STATEWIDE PRESIDENT I DON'T

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.916 region:rollup2
THINK SO BOUGHT IS UNIQUE IN THE

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:08.484 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IN THAT IT'S A DIRECTLY

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:10.319 region:rollup2
ELECTED TRANSIT BOARD.

AND WE ALSO HAVE BY FAR THE

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:13.355 region:rollup2
HIGHEST RIDERSHIP OF ANY RAIL

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.956 region:rollup2
AGENCY IN THE STATE SO WE THINK

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.691 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:17.393 region:rollup2

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:24.166 region:rollup2
ITS UPS.

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:25.401 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW BART AT AND

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.102 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SAID COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:28.704 region:rollup2
THAT PART IS ON ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:31.106 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC. AND.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:33.876 region:rollup2
HOW WITH THAT HOW WAS THAT?

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:34.843 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PHRASE

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.845 region:rollup2
TO BE TAKEN.

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
SO WHERE WOULD THE BUBBLE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:40.749 region:rollup2

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.450 region:rollup2
ARE WE AT PRIMARILY ACCOUNTABLE

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:44.086 region:rollup2
TO THE VOTERS.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.887 region:rollup2
AT SCHOOL ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:46.989 region:rollup2
AND.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:48.324 region:rollup2
WE REPRESENT LOGICDISTRICTS

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:49.558 region:rollup2
THAN TYPICAL CITY COUNCIL IS

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:50.893 region:rollup2
REPRESENT DISTRICTS ABOUT FOUR

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.661 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:54.463 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO A LOTTA

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.730 region:rollup2
COUNTY SUPERVISORS.

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:56.165 region:rollup2
NO WITH.

DIRECTLY ELECTED IN MAY I REMIND

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.569 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THAT THIS BILL ONLY

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.304 region:rollup2
AFFECTS.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.439 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE THERE IS A DIRECTLY

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:05.207 region:rollup2

AND SO WITH THAT.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.278 region:rollup2
AND I CAN SEE THIS WITH

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:12.414 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:19:09.278 --> 01:19:13.749 region:rollup2
HOW IS BART'S INTENT OR OR

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:15.818 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:17.686 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IS THERE A

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:19.455 region:rollup2
CHANGE OR? AT THE REASON WHY I

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.856 region:rollup2
ASK THIS QUESTION ONE WHEN I WAS

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:23.959 region:rollup2
ON THE COUNCIL.

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:25.761 region:rollup2
IN MY CITY AND ALSO WAS MAYOR.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:27.730 region:rollup2
THERE WASN'T A HUGE CAPITAL

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.064 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT IN IN THE

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:30.633 region:rollup2
CITY THAT.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.134 region:rollup2
THAT BART WAS GOING TO DO TO

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:33.702 region:rollup2
THEIR DOWNTOWN BARDS OR TO OUR

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.336 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN BART STATION.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.771 region:rollup2
AND.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:37.973 region:rollup2
PARK WAS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:40.442 region:rollup2
INITIATED CONTACT WITH THE CITY

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:42.177 region:rollup2
CAME IN AND MET WITH THE ELECTED

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:43.979 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS AS WELL AS CITY STAFF.

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:45.681 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CITY WAS

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:47.683 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAY AND

01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:49.251 region:rollup2
EVEN ON THE STYLE OF THE LACK OF

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:51.020 region:rollup2
THE LIGHT STANDARDS.

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:52.621 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GOING TO BE INSTALLED

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.323 region:rollup2
ON BART PROPERTY.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:56.692 region:rollup2
TO FIT THE SURROUNDING.

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:57.393 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT LANDSCAPE SO WHAT

01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:59.395 region:rollup2
IS THE.

01:19:57.393 --> 01:20:01.730 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE INTENT OF BART AS

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:04.366 region:rollup2
FAR AS A ARE YOU USING THIS BILL

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:06.101 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO MINIMIZE LOCAL

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:07.803 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION OR.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.004 region:rollup2
SO YOU YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:11.273 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION BOND HAS A LONG

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:12.908 region:rollup2
STANDING POLICY AND PRACTICE OF

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:14.443 region:rollup2
DEEP COLLABORATION NOT JUST WITH

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.978 region:rollup2
THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ELECTED

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:18.681 region:rollup2
BODIES BUT WITH COMMUNITIES AS

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:20.015 region:rollup2
WELL. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE ROM

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:22.451 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS LITTLE

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:22.618 region:rollup2
I'M COMES INTO EFFECT WE EVEN IT

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:25.087 region:rollup2
IN.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:26.789 region:rollup2
IN VERY RECENTLY PUT IN PLACE A

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:29.324 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHERE WE ARE INVESTING

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:31.093 region:rollup2
BOUGHT DOLLARS IN CITIES. AND

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:32.494 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:33.662 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO ACCESS BART STATION.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:35.764 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:37.566 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH THE CITIES

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:38.934 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES WITHOUT REGARD I'M

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:41.036 region:rollup2
AND I I DID THIS THIS WOULD WE

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:42.638 region:rollup2
WE WE ARE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:44.139 region:rollup2
TO RIP TO RUN OVER A. A SORT OF

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:45.341 region:rollup2
AN EFFICIENT MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:46.342 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN HAVING DEEP

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.409 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH THE

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.178 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WAS

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:50.112 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THANK YOU AND. IF I

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:52.514 region:rollup2
MAY FOR THIS.

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:54.750 region:rollup2
THIS SIDE SECOND A LAST

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:56.418 region:rollup2
QUESTION HERE IF I MAY. ARE AS

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.619 region:rollup2
FAR AS PARTS CONCERNED THAT AND

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:59.121 region:rollup2
I'LL LET ME GIVE SOME BACKGROUND

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.489 region:rollup2
TO THIS THIS QUESTION THE

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:02.591 region:rollup2
LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:03.759 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.561 region:rollup2
FINANCE HOUSING ESTIMATES.

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:07.229 region:rollup2
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:09.064 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:10.165 region:rollup2
HAS ONLY DEVELOPED A HUNDRED AND

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:12.468 region:rollup2
NINE HOMES AS FAR AS A NET

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.869 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:16.572 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S FOR.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:17.606 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:19.241 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED NINE HOMES AND WE'RE

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:20.576 region:rollup2
IN A HOUSING CRISIS

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:22.111 region:rollup2
AS MATTER OF FACT IF YOU WANTED

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:23.979 region:rollup2
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:26.014 region:rollup2
ARENA OBLIGATIONS.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:27.416 region:rollup2
THIS CITY HAS ONLY DEVELOPED A

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:29.251 region:rollup2
POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF ITS

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:31.220 region:rollup2
MARKET RATE HOUSING. TWO POINT

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:33.255 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT OF ITS LOW INCOME

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.957 region:rollup2
HOUSING POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:36.291 region:rollup2
ITS LOW OF ITS LOW INCOME OR

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:40.429 region:rollup2
VERY LOW INCOME FOR TWO POINT

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:43.332 region:rollup2
FOUR

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:45.067 region:rollup2
OF ABOVE MARKET RATE HOUSING.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:47.336 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THAT CONTEXT

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.937 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:51.707 region:rollup2
IMPACT CITIES THAT ARE WORKING

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:53.008 region:rollup2
WITH BART TOT GUIDELINES.

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:54.977 region:rollup2
I'M SO CITIES THAT A.

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.644 region:rollup2
ALREADY MOVING FORWARD AND%

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:57.646 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES TO

01:21:55.644 --> 01:22:00.215 region:rollup2
SO AND I'M THE STATION THE

01:21:57.646 --> 01:22:00.849 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE AND I'M A NE IN A

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.484 region:rollup2
WAY THAT BUT THAT IS SORT OF

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:04.686 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. FOR THAT LOCATION

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:06.054 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE A BIG IMPACT

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.689 region:rollup2
ON THEM BUT BOUGHT DOES I KNOW

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:09.892 region:rollup2
THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES OF

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:11.627 region:rollup2
LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO ITS

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:13.428 region:rollup2
STATIONS WHICH IS. I'M WHICH IS

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:14.930 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PARKING LOTS OF MEN ON

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:17.332 region:rollup2
THAT LAND WE COULD BUILD AYE WE

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.734 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.935 region:rollup2
UNITS

01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:21.270 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO BOX CURRENT TEO DE

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.704 region:rollup2
GUY LA GUIDELINES SEVEN THOUSAND

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.338 region:rollup2
OF WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE. AS

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:25.440 region:rollup2
WELL AS FOUR AND A HALF MILLION

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.008 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.777 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:31.346 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS I'M THIS BILL WOULD

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:32.915 region:rollup2
UNDOUBTEDLY I'M ALLOW BART I'M A

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.615 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL

01:22:32.915 --> 01:22:35.884 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.487 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARM TO DELIVER ON

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:39.855 region:rollup2
THOSE GOALS. BRECHT AND AND I I

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:41.657 region:rollup2
SAY THIS BUT OR EVEN ASK THAT

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:42.357 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:43.992 region:rollup2
SAID THAT.

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.461 region:rollup2
WE JUST NEED TO BRING PEOPLE TO

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:47.729 region:rollup2
THE TABLE AND TALK WE NEED TO

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:49.031 region:rollup2
TALK. I KNOW SITTING ON COUNCIL

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:50.532 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE RHETORIC WE NEED TO

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:51.366 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE AND WE NEED

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:53.969 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT GETTING MORE

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:57.239 region:rollup2
HOUSING. AND YET OUR POLICIES

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:57.806 region:rollup2
ARE ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:58.607 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.342 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT.

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:02.211 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE FINALLY GETTING TO

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:04.246 region:rollup2
A POINT WHERE THE CRISIS IS SO

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:04.980 region:rollup2
BAD I I WAS JUST AT A COMMUNITY

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:06.715 region:rollup2
DID TO.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.885 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY EVENTS THIS PAST

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:10.485 region:rollup2
WEEKEND AND THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:11.854 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:13.689 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:15.023 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THAT YEAH I'M MY

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.859 region:rollup2
LAST QUESTION.

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.860 region:rollup2
IF BART

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:19.528 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.829 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HOUSING ON THESE NEW

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.264 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE AN ANSWER MAY NOT

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.365 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ANSWER THIS BUT IF PART

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:25.133 region:rollup2
DOESN'T PUT HOUSING ON THESE

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:27.002 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES.

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:28.570 region:rollup2
THEN IS IT TRUE THAT BARK CAN

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.239 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.274 region:rollup2
WHATEVER FACILITY THEY WANT UP

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:34.576 region:rollup2
ON THESE PROPERTIES WITHOUT VERY

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:37.479 region:rollup2
MUCH LOCAL REVIEW AT IF ANY AT

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:39.281 region:rollup2
ALL. YES SIR BOND CURRENTLY HAS

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:41.149 region:rollup2
FULL LAND USE AUTHORITY.

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:42.684 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT IS TRANSPORTATION

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:43.986 region:rollup2
RELATED IMPROVEMENTS

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.721 region:rollup2
I'M FOR INSTANCE SO WE COULD

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:46.655 region:rollup2
HAVE BOUGHT COULD ON ITS OWN

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:48.757 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANY.

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:49.591 region:rollup2
INTERFACE WITH THE LOCAL

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.826 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS BUILD A SORT OF AN

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.693 region:rollup2
EIGHT OR NINE STORY PARKING

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:53.795 region:rollup2
GARAGE

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:55.731 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE I'M AND.

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:56.198 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WOULD

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:57.799 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:24:00.035 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD NOT

01:23:57.799 --> 01:24:01.103 region:rollup2
ALLOW BOX TO BUILD WHATEVER IT

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.538 region:rollup2
WANTED FROM A HOUSING

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:03.171 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WOULD REQUIRE BOUGHT

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.907 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:06.441 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS TO ESTABLISH

01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:08.677 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES ABOUT REGARD. RIGHT

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:10.579 region:rollup2
OR OR POSSIBLY OF FIVE HUNDRED

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:12.381 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MAINTENANCE

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:14.249 region:rollup2
FACILITY ARE YES THEY CAN BUILD

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:15.450 region:rollup2
A MULTI STORY. OI COULD BUILD

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:16.852 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TRACKS THROUGH A

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:19.521 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IF IF IT SO WHAT'S

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:20.589 region:rollup2
INTERESTING HERE IS THE THING

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:23.058 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED THE MOST.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:24.526 region:rollup2
AND THE BAY AREA IS HOUSING.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.595 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE THING WERE

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:27.396 region:rollup2
STIFLING THE MOST.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.098 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:32.000 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO.

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:33.435 region:rollup2
GIVE BART AND LOCAL

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.103 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:37.306 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE AND WORK TOGETHER.

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:39.541 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:41.109 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO MEET FOR FOR

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:42.377 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND FOR CONSTITUENTS AND

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.245 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOUSING.

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:46.348 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:50.152 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:51.386 region:rollup2
SO REMEMBER BLOOM.

01:24:50.152 --> 01:24:52.688 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

PROMISES INVESTMENT TO AND MIXED

OUR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.809 region:rollup2
AS AN OFFICER OF THE LEAGUE I

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:49.211 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MANAGE.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:51.947 region:rollup2
S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TWO THE

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.415 region:rollup2

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:56.284 region:rollup2
I MEMBER KNOWS COMMITTEE SAYING

MY COLLEAGUES IS YOU'RE STRONG

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.520 region:rollup2
WITH WHERE THEY'D BE ON CAROL

01:25:57.619 --> 01:26:00.756 region:rollup2
STEINBERG SPILL.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.924 region:rollup2
SINCE I ALWAYS HAVE A QUOTE.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:05.093 region:rollup2
I QUOTE FROM FDR.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:07.095 region:rollup2
WHICH IS STILL APPLICABLE TODAY.

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:09.231 region:rollup2
ONE THING IS SURE.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:10.365 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:12.134 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST WE KNOW

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:13.902 region:rollup2
HOW AT ANY MOMENT.

01:26:12.134 --> 01:26:16.204 region:rollup2
IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT WE

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:17.706 region:rollup2
CAN MODIFY IT AS YOU GO ALONG.

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:18.840 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN THE FACE OF PROBLEMS

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:20.142 region:rollup2
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TO BE A

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.843 region:rollup2
PROBLEM SOLVER TO THE BEST YOU

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:23.779 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:25.681 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT I

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:26.615 region:rollup2
DON'T VIEW THIS ACTUALLY IS.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:28.650 region:rollup2
SEVEN A RULE HERE FOR EVERY

01:26:26.615 --> 01:26:31.053 region:rollup2
SPECIAL DISTRICT.

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:33.255 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS A.

01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:36.558 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT.

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:38.360 region:rollup2
THIS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES.

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:40.095 region:rollup2
SINCE THE SIXTIES.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.464 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:44.099 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE BILLIONS OF

01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:45.600 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF THAT TRASH

01:26:44.099 --> 01:26:47.769 region:rollup2
TRISH OF CHURCHES GONE IN.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.337 region:rollup2
AND THIS POLICY ALIGNS WITH HOW

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:51.740 region:rollup2
DO WE. CAPITALIZE ON THIS PUBLIC

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:53.508 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.143 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH OF

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:56.278 region:rollup2
NARAL CLASS A SPECIAL DISTRICT.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:57.979 region:rollup2
OR WE HAVE APPRECIATED BY

01:26:56.278 --> 01:26:59.481 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PUBLIC

01:26:57.979 --> 01:27:00.949 region:rollup2
INTEREST ALIGNED WITH CLEAR

01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:02.350 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE POLICY.

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.884 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.086 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT TO FURTHER THAT

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:07.155 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:27:04.086 --> 01:27:08.890 region:rollup2
.

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:10.192 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO POINT OUT ACTUALLY

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.793 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THIS GOES BACK

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:13.595 region:rollup2
TO THE SIXTIES.

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:15.030 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:17.165 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE THE

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:18.400 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:20.569 region:rollup2
THE FACTS WILL COME OUT IN THE

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.838 region:rollup2
WASH WILL SEE HOW THIS POLICY.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:24.840 region:rollup2
WORKS OUT IN TIME.

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:26.608 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS A REALITY WHEN YOU

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.209 region:rollup2
HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS A BEEN LONG

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:29.177 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED GOING BACK TO THE

01:27:27.209 --> 01:27:31.413 region:rollup2
SIXTIES.

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:32.914 region:rollup2
AS PEOPLE AGE.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
FOLKS MOVE OUT OF THOSE HOMES A

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:36.251 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT OTHER SORTS OF HOUSING

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:38.019 region:rollup2
I SEE THAT IN MY DISTRICT WHICH

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.554 region:rollup2
IS A. THE AVERAGE AGE EIGHT

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:40.689 region:rollup2
SANDIFER'S IS.

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.791 region:rollup2
OLDER THAN FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:44.793 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:47.496 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:49.498 region:rollup2
A A COMMUNITY OF ALL. SINGLE

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:50.832 region:rollup2
FAMILY HOMES

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:51.867 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE ARE AGENT WHEN THEY

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:53.368 region:rollup2
MOVE INTO COMMITTEE CARE FOR

01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:54.736 region:rollup2
SAYS OTHER SORTS OF THINGS.

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:56.438 region:rollup2
RESTAURANTS AND OTHER THINGS

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:58.173 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY START TO SUFFER.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:59.341 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THE

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:00.342 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD BELIEVED IN THEIR

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:02.177 region:rollup2
HOME DRIVING A LOCAL RESTAURANT

01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:03.912 region:rollup2
AT NIGHT TO EAT.

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:05.514 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PLENTY OF RESTAURANTS

01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:06.214 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LONG ESTABLISHED

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:07.482 region:rollup2
RESTAURANT EIGHT THE SENATE

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.984 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT HAVE CLOSED AND

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:10.852 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED.

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:11.753 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF THEIR

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:13.155 region:rollup2
HOMES AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:14.489 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT POPULATION.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:16.057 region:rollup2
SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THERE IS AN

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:18.226 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THE BILL LIKE THIS AS

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:19.861 region:rollup2
A TEST BED.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:22.898 region:rollup2
IT IS SOOOO GENEROUS IT IS

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:24.499 region:rollup2
UNIQUE CLASS OF PROPERTY.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:26.201 region:rollup2
IT WILL SUPPORT A CLEARLY

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.636 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE GOAL.

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:28.803 region:rollup2
AND AS A STARTS TAKING THESE

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:30.105 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND BRING IN

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:31.273 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL HOUSING IN ADDITION

01:28:30.105 --> 01:28:32.474 region:rollup2
DOLLARS JUST.

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:34.543 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DISPOSAL INCOME INTO

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.511 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS.

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:37.712 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL CONFER

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.447 region:rollup2
A BROADER ECONOMIC BENEFITS

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:41.283 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:42.150 region:rollup2
SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS AND OTHER

01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:44.519 region:rollup2
SORTS OF THINGS AT ALL WILL

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:47.756 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM.

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:49.658 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT SENSE I I FEEL.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:51.760 region:rollup2
ON THE POLICY MERITS OF HOUSING

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:52.994 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CASE IS MADE.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.497 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF SUSTAINING

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.097 region:rollup2
FAVORABLE DYNAMICS AND LONG

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:57.332 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES OF THE

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:59.634 region:rollup2
BAY AREA.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:29:02.170 region:rollup2
I I ACTUALLY FEEL IT IT OFFER

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.170 region:rollup2
SOME IMPORT POTENTIAL.

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:05.140 region:rollup2
AND.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:06.341 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR WORK ON A BE AIMING

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.043 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO RELEASE POSITIVE

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.411 region:rollup2
ENERGY.

01:29:08.043 --> 01:29:11.313 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMITTEES WERE POLICIES

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:12.614 region:rollup2
WILL IMPACT I THINK.

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:13.815 region:rollup2
I PERSONALLY THINK ITS BROADER

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:16.218 region:rollup2
EVEN THAN THE CASE I HEARD HERE

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:17.619 region:rollup2
I THINK WILL. SUPPORT.

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:19.120 region:rollup2
RESTAURANTS AND OTHER SERVICES

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.121 region:rollup2
IN ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES ALONG

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.890 region:rollup2
BARTTELOT MONTHS.

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:25.994 region:rollup2
AND THAT'LL BE BENEFICIAL THOSE

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:28.163 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL.

01:29:25.994 --> 01:29:28.496 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER ROOM ANYONE OTHER ROOM

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:30.332 region:rollup2
CLEAN MEMBERS.

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:32.367 region:rollup2
.

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:34.002 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BOUGHT WALDRON

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:36.471 region:rollup2
THINKING ASSIST WONDERING WHERE

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:36.938 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PARK IF YOU DO THE

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:38.773 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT YOU WANTED

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:41.509 region:rollup2
SO PARKING WOULD STILL BE A

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:43.245 region:rollup2
PERMISSIBLE OPTION OF FOR A

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT THE IDEAS

01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:46.214 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT AROUND THESE PARTS

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:48.183 region:rollup2
STATIONS. WE'VE HUNDREDS OF

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.751 region:rollup2
ACRES OF SIMPLE PARKING LOT

01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:50.719 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE AND WHAT

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.720 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROPOSING IS LET'S BILL

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:52.787 region:rollup2
HOUSING ON TOP OF THAT LET'S

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.190 region:rollup2
BUILD A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:56.458 region:rollup2
DIVISION AS. TO BE ABLE TO GO TO

01:29:55.190 --> 01:29:57.859 region:rollup2
A PARK STATION TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:59.861 region:rollup2
WALK AROUND IS MISTER COOLEY

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:01.930 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED TO THE RESTAURANT TO

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:03.365 region:rollup2
THE CORNER STORE. TO YOUR HOME

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:04.432 region:rollup2
AND TO BE ABLE PARK UNDERNEATH

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
IT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:09.738 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO DO SO

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:11.873 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT PRECLUDING PARKING.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:13.308 region:rollup2
MALES SHOULD BOND HAS A UP

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:15.243 region:rollup2
PARKING REPLACEMENT POLICY.

01:30:13.308 --> 01:30:16.311 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SO CLOSELY LINKED TO

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.913 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT ON BOUGHT LAND

01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:19.848 region:rollup2
THAT OVER THE PAST SINCE

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:20.849 region:rollup2
INCEPTION UP PRIVATE DEVELOPERS

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:22.817 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY PAID FOR THREE

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:23.852 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHAT THE

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:25.120 region:rollup2
BOUGHT PARKING STRUCTURE BUT.

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:28.189 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PARKING STRUCTURES TO

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.891 region:rollup2
BE BUILT ON THE? BOTTOM LINE AND

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:30.759 region:rollup2
I'M HAS.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:32.260 region:rollup2
I SAID TRYING TO GOING TO

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.762 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN OVER THE

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.896 region:rollup2
SUB IS PARKING LOTS WE BASICALLY

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.398 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT WHAT WAS ONCE FLAT AND

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:37.899 region:rollup2
PUT IN A. IN A STRUCTURE IN MANY

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:39.467 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:40.335 region:rollup2
AND ONE OTHER QUICK POINT IS THE

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.703 region:rollup2
POINT OF BUILDING HOUSING ON TOP

01:30:40.335 --> 01:30:44.306 region:rollup2
OF.

01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:45.106 region:rollup2
TRANSIT IS SO THAT FOLKS DON'T

01:30:44.306 --> 01:30:46.775 region:rollup2
HAVE TO OWN CARS BECAUSE WE'VE

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:48.843 region:rollup2
SEEN A MASSIVE EXPANSION AND

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:50.245 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND ALL THOSE FOLKS

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:51.279 region:rollup2
ARE PURCHASING CARS DRIVING IN

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:53.148 region:rollup2
THIS PARKING LOTS AND PARKING

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.282 region:rollup2
THEM. IF WE BUILT HUNDREDS OF

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:56.318 region:rollup2
UNITS ON TOP OF THAT WE COULD

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:58.353 region:rollup2
AVOID THAT CONGESTION AND THAT

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:51.239 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED AN AMENDMENT

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:53.441 region:rollup2
INITIALLY THE FIRST VERSION OF

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:54.542 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SAID THAT REGARDLESS

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:55.810 region:rollup2

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.527 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SUGGESTION.

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:14.596 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:16.030 region:rollup2
TO FOSTER PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

BUILD. HAVE NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:33.481 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING NEW

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.949 region:rollup2
AYE AND.

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.383 region:rollup2

OF THE LOWER TIER ISSUES TO

ENSURE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:33.007 region:rollup2

CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT OVERRIDING

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:50.091 region:rollup2

SIMMERED APART TO COME TO THE

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:59.701 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND REQUEST THE SAME

TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN PARCELS

01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:02.737 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD TO CALL ME.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.872 region:rollup2
THE BILL'S APPROACH DOES NOT

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:05.206 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION A

01:34:03.872 --> 01:34:06.107 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP AMONGST LOCAL

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:09.010 region:rollup2

AGREES WITH ME MY FRUSTRATION IS

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:21.990 region:rollup2
IS THAT. WE HAVE COUNCILS.

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:23.391 region:rollup2

I'VE HAD IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL.

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.764 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS I DON'T FEEL THAT

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:32.400 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT THAT I CAN TAKE

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:33.968 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL WAY. I FEEL LIKE

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.769 region:rollup2

A ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WE

01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:44.738 region:rollup2
USED ALL OF OUR SPECIAL STUDY

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:46.807 region:rollup2

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:47.374 region:rollup2

01:50:46.807 --> 01:50:49.409 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:50.511 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. ARE STUDY POINTED TO

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:52.079 region:rollup2
AREAS WERE CONSOLIDATION OF

01:50:50.511 --> 01:50:53.213 region:rollup2

01:50:52.079 --> 01:50:54.815 region:rollup2
SENSE TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:56.483 region:rollup2
PICTURE IN THE LONG TERM

01:50:54.815 --> 01:50:57.918 region:rollup2
VIABILITY OF SERVICES. THAT WE

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:59.086 region:rollup2
HELD HEARINGS WHEN PRESENTED TO

01:50:57.918 --> 01:51:00.420 region:rollup2
EVERY FIRE DISTRICT AND FOUND

01:50:59.086 --> 01:51:01.455 region:rollup2
THAT NONE OF THE FIRE DISTRICT

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.656 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN PRESENTED WITH THIS

01:51:01.455 --> 01:51:04.024 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WERE INTERESTED IN

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.492 region:rollup2
MAKING THE ORGANIZATIONAL

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:07.427 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO THE DISTRICT.

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.695 region:rollup2
AND OUR LAST ROUND OF MS OURS WE

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:09.796 region:rollup2
DID NOT INTEND TO DO A DETAILED

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:11.031 region:rollup2
STUDY OF EACH FIRE DISTRICT

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:12.933 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE RESPONSE THAT WE HAD

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:14.301 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED. BUT UNLIKE

01:51:12.933 --> 01:51:15.602 region:rollup2
BEFORE ONE OF THE DISTRICT TOLD

01:51:14.301 --> 01:51:17.204 region:rollup2
US THEY WERE READY TO SERIOUSLY

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:18.438 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. WE REACHED

01:51:17.204 --> 01:51:19.873 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING FIRE

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:21.808 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND FOUND INSERTS

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:23.110 region:rollup2
INTEREST THERE AS WELL. AT LEAST

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:24.278 region:rollup2
ONE BOARD WAS READY AND BOTH

01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:25.412 region:rollup2
FIRE DISTRICT HAD JUST LET GO OF

01:51:24.278 --> 01:51:26.747 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRE CHIEFS

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:28.549 region:rollup2
PRESENTING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

01:51:26.747 --> 01:51:30.317 region:rollup2
CLEAR HURDLES THAT USUALLY STAND

01:51:28.549 --> 01:51:32.152 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS.

01:51:30.317 --> 01:51:33.820 region:rollup2
WE HAD GOOD INTEREST BUT LOW

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:34.922 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO CONDUCT A STUDY THAT

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.123 region:rollup2
COULD LEAD TO BETTER SERVICES

01:51:34.922 --> 01:51:37.858 region:rollup2
AND FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR EACH

01:51:36.123 --> 01:51:39.159 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS.

01:51:37.858 --> 01:51:40.260 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE REASONS THAT FIRE

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.728 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WERE INTERESTED WAS

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.697 region:rollup2
DUE TO THEIR INCREASING COST

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:45.732 region:rollup2
REGION OPERATIONS. ARE LOCAL

01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:47.000 region:rollup2
LASKO HOWEVER HAD SPENT MOST OF

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:48.368 region:rollup2
OUR SPECIAL STUDY REVENUE

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.670 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT PARKS AND SANITATION

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:51.605 region:rollup2
DISTRICT SO WE FACED A

01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:52.973 region:rollup2
CROSSROADS. IF WE HAD A GRANT

01:51:51.605 --> 01:51:55.108 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE ENVISIONED

01:51:52.973 --> 01:51:56.310 region:rollup2
IT AB TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT THE

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:57.344 region:rollup2
CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR.

01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:58.679 region:rollup2
THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL

01:51:57.344 --> 01:52:00.447 region:rollup2
APPLICATION WE COULD STUDY THE

01:51:58.679 --> 01:52:02.216 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:03.584 region:rollup2
DLIVERY SALARY AND BENEFITS

01:52:02.216 --> 01:52:04.618 region:rollup2
PARITY AND LONG TERM PERSONNEL

01:52:03.584 --> 01:52:05.886 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:52:04.618 --> 01:52:06.987 region:rollup2
A STUDY LIKE THIS WOULD COST

01:52:05.886 --> 01:52:09.056 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:52:06.987 --> 01:52:10.924 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND WOULD TAX THE

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:12.659 region:rollup2
BUDGETS OF ALL THREE AGENCIES.

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:14.294 region:rollup2
OF THE TOP REASONS THAT LAUGH GO

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.929 region:rollup2
DO NOT INITIATE THE ACTIONS TO

01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:17.097 region:rollup2
IMPROVE SERVICES THE LACK OF

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:19.032 region:rollup2
FUNDING ALWAYS FEATURES

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:20.500 region:rollup2
PROMINENTLY. IN FACT FORTY SIX

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:22.035 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF LEFT GOES HAVE AN

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.770 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BUDGET OF UNDER TWO

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:24.871 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.506 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT A FINANCIAL

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.708 region:rollup2
IMPACT THESE KINDS OF STUDIES

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:28.809 region:rollup2
HAVE ON LAUGH GOES.

01:52:27.708 --> 01:52:30.177 region:rollup2
THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION

01:52:28.809 --> 01:52:31.645 region:rollup2
RARELY RECOMMENDS FUNDING TO

01:52:30.177 --> 01:52:33.347 region:rollup2
SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT FORTUNATELY

01:52:31.645 --> 01:52:35.682 region:rollup2
THEY SAW THAT A SMALL ONETIME

01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:37.117 region:rollup2
INFUSION OF ONE MILLION TO THREE

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:38.018 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:39.553 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY COULD SAVE

01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:40.887 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ADDITIONAL

01:52:39.553 --> 01:52:42.856 region:rollup2
MONEY. IF IT LEADS TO A

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:43.957 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:45.525 region:rollup2
IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN SERVICE

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:47.094 region:rollup2
DELIVERY.

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:48.161 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE

01:52:47.094 --> 01:52:49.997 region:rollup2
SEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:51.498 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH

01:52:49.997 --> 01:52:53.266 region:rollup2
THE SLOW DELIBERATE OF WACKO

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:54.468 region:rollup2
PROCESSES AND INTRODUCED BILLS

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:56.403 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE LOCAL

01:52:54.468 --> 01:52:57.070 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF ISSUES. TEST IS THE

01:52:56.403 --> 01:52:58.505 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION OF SPECIAL

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:59.840 region:rollup2

TODAY I ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR A

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.709 region:rollup2
BI TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT TO PROVIDE

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:03.677 region:rollup2
THE ONLY FUNDING WE WOULD GET

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:06.046 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO CONDUCT OUR

WE KEEP DECISIONS MADE AT THE

01:53:14.021 --> 01:53:16.957 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL WHICH IS THE BEST

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:18.125 region:rollup2

01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:17.511 region:rollup2
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS TO MEET.

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:19.513 region:rollup2
YOUR SOURCE OF REVENUE IS VERY

01:55:17.511 --> 01:55:21.481 region:rollup2
HIGHLY LIMITED THERE IS LITTLE

01:55:19.513 --> 01:55:23.350 region:rollup2
TO NO ROOM TO TAKE AN IN DEPTH

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:25.185 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SERVICE AREAS WHERE THEY

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:26.987 region:rollup2
CAN UP. AND WHERE FISHING SEIZE

01:55:25.185 --> 01:55:28.288 region:rollup2
CAN BE GAINED.

01:55:26.987 --> 01:55:29.723 region:rollup2
SERVICE EFFICIENCIES THAT WILL

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:31.091 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A MORE

01:55:29.723 --> 01:55:32.259 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED AND COST EFFECTIVE

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.461 region:rollup2
WAY OF DELIVERING QUALITY

01:55:32.259 --> 01:55:35.529 region:rollup2
MUNICIPAL SERVICES.

01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:37.998 region:rollup2
AND LITTLETON NO ROOM TO TAKE

01:55:35.529 --> 01:55:39.299 region:rollup2
ACTION.

01:55:37.998 --> 01:55:40.634 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LITTLE

01:55:39.299 --> 01:55:42.502 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT AND

01:55:40.634 --> 01:55:44.171 region:rollup2
THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:45.639 region:rollup2
ONE TIME GRANT FUNDING.

01:55:44.171 --> 01:55:47.874 region:rollup2
ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY

01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:49.643 region:rollup2
MADE AND ONE THAT WE AGREE WITH

01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:51.077 region:rollup2
IS TO TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT

01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:53.213 region:rollup2
THE HUGELY DISPIRITO TEST

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:55.015 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

01:55:53.213 --> 01:55:57.050 region:rollup2
THE LEVELS ARE ARBITRARY AND

01:55:55.015 --> 01:55:58.752 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR A LAUGH

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:59.920 region:rollup2
CHO INITIATED ACTION.

01:55:58.752 --> 01:56:00.787 region:rollup2
WHICH CAME ABOUT IN NINETEEN

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.022 region:rollup2
NINETY THREE WHEN LAUGH BECAUSE

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:03.990 region:rollup2
WE'RE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE POWER

01:56:02.022 --> 01:56:05.625 region:rollup2
TO INITIATE ACTION.

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:06.726 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED THIS IS ONE OF

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:07.961 region:rollup2
THE TOP THREE REASONS WHY LAUGH

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:09.229 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ACTUALLY DO NOT INITIATE

01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:11.231 region:rollup2
ACTION.

01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:12.299 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALLOWS THOSE ACTIONS

01:56:11.231 --> 01:56:14.034 region:rollup2
ONLY DURING THAT FIVE YEAR

01:56:12.299 --> 01:56:16.102 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND ONLY PERTAINING TO

01:56:14.034 --> 01:56:18.138 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM. TO MERE EXISTING

01:56:16.102 --> 01:56:19.573 region:rollup2
STATUTE AT IT IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:56:18.138 --> 01:56:20.941 region:rollup2
THRESHOLDS.

01:56:19.573 --> 01:56:22.275 region:rollup2
SOME MAY ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT

01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:23.476 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO RAISE THE

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:25.545 region:rollup2
PROTESTS THRESHOLD WITHOUT A

01:56:23.476 --> 01:56:27.347 region:rollup2
LONG STUDY. AND THAT WE HAVE

01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:29.015 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT DATA TO SUPPORT

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:30.650 region:rollup2
SUCH AN ACTION AT THIS TIME. BUT

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:32.085 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE RAISING THE THRESHOLD

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:34.754 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME LEVEL AS NON LAUGH

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:36.189 region:rollup2
CHO INITIATED PROCESSES.

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:37.657 region:rollup2
PRESERVES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:39.426 region:rollup2
PROTEST.

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:41.294 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD.

01:56:39.426 --> 01:56:42.495 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:44.865 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:46.433 region:rollup2
PROTESTS LEVELS AT TEN PERCENT.

01:56:44.865 --> 01:56:48.435 region:rollup2
TODAY WE'RE ASKING ONLY FOR A

01:56:46.433 --> 01:56:50.403 region:rollup2
LIMITED CHANGE FOR A LIMITED

01:56:48.435 --> 01:56:53.306 region:rollup2

02:07:02.482 --> 02:07:05.651 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD HAVE REDUCTION TO THE

02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:06.853 region:rollup2
READ THE ROUGH HOWEVER IT WOULD

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:08.788 region:rollup2
BE OFFSET WITH.

02:07:06.853 --> 02:07:09.255 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND IN THAT'S SOMETHING

02:07:08.788 --> 02:07:11.090 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:07:09.255 --> 02:07:11.891 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING FURTHER ON.

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:13.693 region:rollup2
OKAY SETS US THAT WOULD GENERAL

02:07:11.891 --> 02:07:17.130 region:rollup2
FUNDS BUT I NOTICED THAT THE

02:07:13.693 --> 02:07:18.464 region:rollup2
BILL. IS IS PROTECTING SOME

02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:19.999 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOT

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:22.268 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY OTHER SO WHAT ABOUT

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:23.803 region:rollup2
BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:07:22.268 --> 02:07:25.238 region:rollup2
MITCHELL VETO IT WOULD YES A

02:07:23.803 --> 02:07:27.140 region:rollup2
BASIC EX BASS GATE SCHOOL

02:07:25.238 --> 02:07:28.441 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS DON'T RECEIVE ARE FOR

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:30.109 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WEB WHEN YOU'RE A CITY.

02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:31.611 region:rollup2
IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:33.479 region:rollup2
IS I THINK A ONE OF IS THE ONLY

02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:34.881 region:rollup2
BE SICK EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:36.449 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THEY DON'T

02:07:34.881 --> 02:07:37.817 region:rollup2
RECEIVE EUROPE I PURCHASE A FACT

02:07:36.449 --> 02:07:39.552 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS THAT THEIR BASIC

02:07:37.817 --> 02:07:41.587 region:rollup2
QUE SO DOES SO THE TAKE. THAT

02:07:39.552 --> 02:07:43.656 region:rollup2
THE DEDUCTION OF MONIES FROM YOU

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:44.157 region:rollup2
RALPH.

02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:45.358 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT AFFECT THEM.

02:07:44.157 --> 02:07:46.559 region:rollup2
OKAY

02:07:45.358 --> 02:07:47.593 region:rollup2
THAT THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH

02:07:46.559 --> 02:07:49.562 region:rollup2
THIS AND I'M NOT I'M NOT GOING

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:50.997 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THAT

02:07:49.562 --> 02:07:52.331 region:rollup2
PROP THIRTEEN WAS IN ARTFULLY

02:07:50.997 --> 02:07:53.466 region:rollup2
DOWN IN AND PUT IN PLACE A

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:55.268 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

02:07:53.466 --> 02:07:57.069 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD THAT THEN.

02:07:55.268 --> 02:07:58.471 region:rollup2
DO PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE

02:07:57.069 --> 02:08:00.673 region:rollup2
WHICH LEADS TO HEREAFTER THE

02:07:58.471 --> 02:08:01.974 region:rollup2
TROUBLE FLIPS TO TO A NUMBER OF

02:08:00.673 --> 02:08:04.610 region:rollup2
FINANCING MECHANISMS THAT HAVE

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:05.711 region:rollup2
HAD TO MOVE. MONEY AROUND AND

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:08.447 region:rollup2
THE FACT TO ME THAT ORANGE

02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:09.448 region:rollup2
COUNTY IS ARTIFICIALLY LOW WAS

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:11.551 region:rollup2
REALLY BASED ON DECISIONS OF THE

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:13.319 region:rollup2
COUNTY. YEARS AGO AND IF WE'RE

02:08:11.551 --> 02:08:14.987 region:rollup2
GOING TO START TO OPEN UP HOW WE

02:08:13.319 --> 02:08:16.656 region:rollup2
FINANCE AND HOW WE MANAGE

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:18.424 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES I THINK WE HAVE

02:08:16.656 --> 02:08:19.859 region:rollup2
TO LOOK ACROSS EQUITABLY.

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:22.094 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE IVAN NUMBER

02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:23.696 region:rollup2
CITY CENTER LOW WELL CITIES THAT

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:25.631 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALSO STRUGGLING IN NEXT

02:08:23.696 --> 02:08:26.832 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS BECAUSE HE OF OF

02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:28.000 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY HOW IT WAS PUT

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:28.534 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO I THINK WE HAVE A

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.836 region:rollup2
MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN.

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:32.004 region:rollup2
AND.

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:33.506 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

02:08:32.004 --> 02:08:35.074 region:rollup2
GO IN ONE PIECE AT A TIME AND

02:08:33.506 --> 02:08:37.109 region:rollup2
TRY AND SOLVE.

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:37.710 region:rollup2
ONE COUNTIES PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:39.011 region:rollup2
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GENERAL

02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:40.613 region:rollup2
FUND WHEN WHEN WE DON'T

02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:41.714 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY KNOW.

02:08:40.613 --> 02:08:42.882 region:rollup2
HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK ON WHAT

02:08:41.714 --> 02:08:45.451 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO MEAN AND BECAUSE

02:08:42.882 --> 02:08:47.720 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE? A BROADER WAY OF

02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:48.721 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THIS ISSUE WITH ALL

02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:50.623 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER LOW WEALTH.

02:08:48.721 --> 02:08:52.158 region:rollup2
CITIES AND.

02:08:50.623 --> 02:08:53.893 region:rollup2
AND JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT WE

02:08:52.158 --> 02:08:54.994 region:rollup2
ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SO I I'M

02:08:53.893 --> 02:08:57.263 region:rollup2
REALLY LOW THEN WE SHOULD BE

02:08:54.994 --> 02:08:58.831 region:rollup2
VERY CAREFUL CHERRY PICKING.

02:08:57.263 --> 02:09:00.266 region:rollup2
AWAY AT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

02:08:58.831 --> 02:09:02.535 region:rollup2
TO HAVE AN IMPACT HERE

02:09:00.266 --> 02:09:03.369 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY IMPACT.

02:09:02.535 --> 02:09:05.271 region:rollup2
DOWN THE LINE WITHOUT

02:09:03.369 --> 02:09:06.872 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING HOW WE AS A STATE

02:09:05.271 --> 02:09:08.941 region:rollup2
OR HAVE A STRATEGY ON HOW WE

02:09:06.872 --> 02:09:11.043 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME EQUITY ACROSS THE

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:12.545 region:rollup2
BOARD BECAUSE WHAT PROP THIRTEEN

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:14.413 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT LOCKED DOWN IN THE

02:09:12.545 --> 02:09:15.948 region:rollup2
WAY IT. WENT LOCKED DOWN THE

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:17.216 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX IN THE WAY THAT

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:19.018 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND CITIES RECEIVE

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:19.885 region:rollup2
REVENUE THERE THERE'S TREMENDOUS

02:09:19.018 --> 02:09:22.822 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF INEQUITIES ACROSS

02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:23.456 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IN SCHOOL FINANCING

02:09:22.822 --> 02:09:24.323 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE

02:09:23.456 --> 02:09:24.924 region:rollup2
AS SIMPLE AS.

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:26.525 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THE STATE'S GENERAL

02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:28.060 region:rollup2
FUND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:29.662 region:rollup2
LOSER HERE I THINK POTENTIALLY

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:31.530 region:rollup2
IN SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS IT

02:09:29.662 --> 02:09:33.199 region:rollup2
HAS IMPLICATIONS ON ON OTHER

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:34.300 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND I AND I THINK THIS

02:09:33.199 --> 02:09:37.803 region:rollup2
IS. NOT AN APPROPRIATE STEP TO

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:39.071 region:rollup2
TAKE.

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:39.438 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:41.741 region:rollup2

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:51.083 region:rollup2
HUGE I WERE EXPERIENCING THE

02:09:49.649 --> 02:09:52.284 region:rollup2
SAME THING.

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:54.353 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH SOME SPECIAL

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:55.755 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT ARE BEING HUGELY.

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:58.291 region:rollup2
SHORTED.

02:09:55.755 --> 02:09:58.891 region:rollup2
THAT NEED THE SUPPORT HOWEVER I

02:09:58.291 --> 02:10:01.961 region:rollup2
DO SURE.

02:09:58.891 --> 02:10:03.929 region:rollup2
SENTIMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE

02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:05.865 region:rollup2
MISTER STONE ON. JUST HITTING

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:08.401 region:rollup2
THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AND THAT

02:10:05.865 --> 02:10:11.237 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MUCH BROADER.

02:10:08.401 --> 02:10:12.905 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAN JUST A DISTRICT AND

02:10:11.237 --> 02:10:15.975 region:rollup2
IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:17.109 region:rollup2
AND IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY AND.

02:10:15.975 --> 02:10:19.078 region:rollup2
I IF YOU DO THE WORD USED THE

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:20.946 region:rollup2
WORD PIECEMEAL BUT FOR LACK OF

02:10:19.078 --> 02:10:22.515 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WORD RIGHT NOW TO JUST

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:24.850 region:rollup2
TRY TO DO IT ONE LITTLE. AT A

02:10:22.515 --> 02:10:27.086 region:rollup2
TIME IS IS A BIT PROBLEMATIC.

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:28.554 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE START TURNING

02:10:27.086 --> 02:10:29.555 region:rollup2
TO THE GENERAL FUND TO BE THE

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:31.290 region:rollup2
BACKFILL.

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:32.558 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SAY ALL

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:34.627 region:rollup2
WITH THE GENERAL FUNDS GOING TO

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:36.629 region:rollup2
DO THIS BUT THEN. WHEN THE

02:10:34.627 --> 02:10:38.297 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND TAKES AHEAD AND IT

02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:40.066 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO TAKE A HIT. THERE'S

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:41.534 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO.

02:10:40.066 --> 02:10:42.868 region:rollup2
BE SHORTER BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

02:10:41.534 --> 02:10:44.370 region:rollup2
DISTRICT I BELIEVE IF I

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:45.237 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY DO HAVE

02:10:44.370 --> 02:10:46.439 region:rollup2
THAT PROTECTION OF PROP NINETY

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:48.741 region:rollup2
EIGHT SO THERE'S GONNA BE

02:10:46.439 --> 02:10:50.543 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. THAT'S GOING TO

02:10:48.741 --> 02:10:51.510 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT SHORTAGE IF IT'S

02:10:50.543 --> 02:10:53.412 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE DEPENDING ON THE

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:54.180 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND TO DO THE BACKFILL

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:57.783 region:rollup2

02:10:57.783 --> 02:11:00.286 region:rollup2
SAY NO ON IT BUT I AM PROBABLY

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:02.221 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA GO UP ON IT AS WELL

THANK YOU.

BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY

02:11:37.056 --> 02:11:40.292 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING. THINGS HAPPEN

02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:22.886 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY ASKING

02:44:20.684 --> 02:44:24.888 region:rollup2

02:44:25.956 --> 02:44:30.160 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TECHNICAL CHANGES

02:44:28.125 --> 02:44:32.596 region:rollup2
WHILE HOLDING OFF ON SUBSTANTIVE

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:34.531 region:rollup2

A MINIMUM WE HAVE COMPLETED

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.900 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATION

02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:39.370 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:40.471 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

02:44:39.370 --> 02:44:42.206 region:rollup2
THEN THE RULES THAT ARE COMING

02:44:40.471 --> 02:44:43.841 region:rollup2
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

02:44:42.206 --> 02:44:45.542 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT ANY DAY.

02:44:43.841 --> 02:44:47.478 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD

02:44:45.542 --> 02:44:49.279 region:rollup2
MOVE THE TIMING OF THE ABILITY

02:44:47.478 --> 02:44:51.215 region:rollup2
TO PAY DETERMINATION. AND IF AB

02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:52.716 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTY THREE WAS ENACTED

02:44:51.215 --> 02:44:54.151 region:rollup2
AS IT'S WRITTEN PACE

02:44:52.716 --> 02:44:55.619 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE REQUIRED

02:44:54.151 --> 02:44:57.054 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION

02:44:55.619 --> 02:44:59.156 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE EXECUTION OF THE HOME

02:44:57.054 --> 02:45:00.257 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. THAT'S NOT

02:44:59.156 --> 02:45:02.359 region:rollup2
A TECHNICAL CHANGE FOR PACE

02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:03.927 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS THAT TREATS PAYS

02:45:02.359 --> 02:45:05.863 region:rollup2
AS A MORTGAGE PRODUCT WHICH TO

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:07.765 region:rollup2
THIS BODY HAS REAFFIRMED TIME

02:45:05.863 --> 02:45:10.134 region:rollup2
AND TIME AGAIN IT IS NOT. PACE

02:45:07.765 --> 02:45:11.969 region:rollup2
IS A UNIQUE ALTERNATIVE SOURCE

02:45:10.134 --> 02:45:13.737 region:rollup2
OF CONSUMER FINANCING.

02:45:11.969 --> 02:45:15.973 region:rollup2
IN DELIBERATIONS LAST YEAR WE

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:17.708 region:rollup2
TOOK GREAT PAINS.

02:45:15.973 --> 02:45:18.742 region:rollup2
YEAH AS A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO

02:45:17.708 --> 02:45:20.911 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE

02:45:18.742 --> 02:45:22.713 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE

02:45:20.911 --> 02:45:23.614 region:rollup2
HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT AT THE

02:45:22.713 --> 02:45:25.382 region:rollup2
RECORDATION OF THE PACE

02:45:23.614 --> 02:45:27.351 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

02:45:25.382 --> 02:45:29.419 region:rollup2
UNDER STATE LAW A CONSUMER HAS

02:45:27.351 --> 02:45:31.088 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS WHERE THEY CAN CANCEL

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:32.790 region:rollup2
THE PACE ASSESSMENT AND MAY

02:45:31.088 --> 02:45:34.124 region:rollup2
CHOOSE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF

FINANCING FROM PACE AT THAT

02:45:34.124 --> 02:45:37.294 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:45:35.726 --> 02:45:38.061 region:rollup2
CANCELING PACE DOES NOT

02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:40.097 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE

02:45:38.061 --> 02:45:41.165 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER IS NOT READY TO MOVE

02:45:40.097 --> 02:45:42.533 region:rollup2

02:45:41.165 --> 02:45:44.268 region:rollup2
CONTRACT.

02:45:42.533 --> 02:45:46.036 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A

02:45:44.268 --> 02:45:47.738 region:rollup2
SEPARATE INDEPENDENT.

02:45:46.036 --> 02:45:49.106 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM WE HOPE TO

.

02:51:45.595 --> 02:51:49.933 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BELT ON.

02:51:48.165 --> 02:51:52.202 region:rollup2
THE.

02:51:49.933 --> 02:51:53.136 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS

02:51:52.202 --> 02:51:56.573 region:rollup2
HAD IS.

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:58.441 region:rollup2
IS REALLY BEING ABLE TO.

02:51:56.573 --> 02:52:00.544 region:rollup2
MARKET TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY

02:51:58.441 --> 02:52:01.144 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD IT AND PROBABLY

02:52:00.544 --> 02:52:03.013 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOLD THE

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:04.247 region:rollup2
PRODUCT. UP OR JUST DIDN'T

02:52:03.013 --> 02:52:06.216 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT AND.

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:07.751 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS

02:52:06.216 --> 02:52:09.519 region:rollup2
WOULD PUT.

02:52:07.751 --> 02:52:10.587 region:rollup2
THE PACE PROGRAM AT A

02:52:09.519 --> 02:52:13.323 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IS.

02:52:10.587 --> 02:52:15.425 region:rollup2
.

02:52:13.323 --> 02:52:16.993 region:rollup2
IT'S I I'M I'M SORRY BUT IT'S

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:18.528 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S LAUGHABLE.

02:52:16.993 --> 02:52:20.297 region:rollup2
NO OTHER.

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:22.265 region:rollup2
HOME IMPROVEMENT.

02:52:20.297 --> 02:52:24.467 region:rollup2
.

02:52:22.265 --> 02:52:26.670 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:29.339 region:rollup2
GETS TO BE IN FIRST PLACE.

02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:32.843 region:rollup2
AND GET THE AT INTEREST RATES

02:52:29.339 --> 02:52:33.476 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AYE DEFAULT WOULD BRING

02:52:32.843 --> 02:52:36.546 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS.

02:52:33.476 --> 02:52:38.181 region:rollup2
THIS IS A REALLY SPECIALIZED

02:52:36.546 --> 02:52:40.317 region:rollup2
PRIDE PROJECT THAT.

02:52:38.181 --> 02:52:41.852 region:rollup2
REALLY PUTS.

02:52:40.317 --> 02:52:43.119 region:rollup2
PACE PROGRAM IN FRONT OF

02:52:41.852 --> 02:52:45.088 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE

02:52:43.119 --> 02:52:46.523 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER WOULD BE PAYING AND SO

02:52:45.088 --> 02:52:47.824 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON I THINK IT'S

02:52:46.523 --> 02:52:49.159 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:50.594 region:rollup2
SOME ANALYSIS AS EARLY AS

02:52:49.159 --> 02:52:52.162 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AS TO WHETHER THAT

02:52:50.594 --> 02:52:53.496 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER CAN REALLY AFFORD.

02:52:52.162 --> 02:52:55.665 region:rollup2
NOT TO ADD THIS TO THEIR

02:52:53.496 --> 02:52:56.800 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES IN SUCH A WAY

02:52:55.665 --> 02:52:58.001 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COULD RISK LOSING

02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:58.501 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES SO I THINK IT'S A

02:52:58.001 --> 02:53:02.973 region:rollup2
GOOD BILL.

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:04.874 region:rollup2
