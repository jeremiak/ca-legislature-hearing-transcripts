THOUGH THIS CONFERENCE HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING SYMBOL OF. STERN ADVOCACY AND ANDY AS STATE POLITICS IN IN CALIFORNIA AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW DIFFERENT. YOU ASPECTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THIS CONFERENCE FIRST OFF FORCES A JOINT HEARING. IN INCOME WHILE IN THE PAST IT'S ONLY BEEN FOR THE SENATE OR THE ASSEMBLY SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. THANK YOU MISTER PROPER FOR ALL THAT. AND SECONDLY. IN YEARS PAST WE HAVE. ELECTED TO PRE SELECT THE TOPICS THAT THE DELEGATES WILL BE SPEAKING ON. IN IN THAT THAT WAS JUST A DECISION MADE BY THE STAFF SO THAT. WE COULD. BEST PRESENT WILL. STAFF BOB WAS THE. MOST PRESSING ISSUES FACING THE CALIFORNIA. EDUCATION SYSTEM TODAY HOWEVER THIS YEAR. WE THE DECISION WAS MADE TO. HOW THE TOPIC SELECTION FULLY MADE BY THE DELEGATES THEMSELVES? AND ON THE FIRST DAY THEY SPEND ABOUT TWO HOURS. DEBATING. ADVOCATING AND EVENTUALLY SETTLING ON FIVE DIFFERENT TOPICS. AND AND THAT'S JUST GOES TO SHOW. HOW MUCH WE TRUST AND HOW MUCH WE? ARE ADVOCATE FOR THE IDEA OF SIZE OF. GENUINE AUTHENTIC STUDENT VOICE IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. OF IT ALRIGHT SO. WITH THAT I WOULD. ARE KEYS THE FIVE TOPICS THAT WILL BE GOING OVER TODAY THAT HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY THE. DELEGATES HAD. R. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MENTAL HEALTH. SOON REPRESENTATION IMMIGRATION. AND ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE STUDENTS WILL NOW PRESENT OUR FIRST TOPIC WHICH IS RESTORED OF JUSTICE. THE PANEL MAY COME FORWARD AND PROCEED WHEN READY. GOOD AFTERNOON DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE BY NAY MITCHELL FINE YOU AND I'M FROM THE LODI UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN STOCKTON. MY NAME IS HOPE YELP. AND I'M FROM SAN DIEGO UNIFIED HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO. MY NAME IS AVE MADDIE AND I'M FROM THE BEVERLY HILLS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EVIDENCE DOES NOT SHOW THAT DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES TO REMOVE STUDENTS FROM INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS SUSPENSIONS OR EXPLOSIONS. HOPE IMPROVE EITHER STUDENT BEHAVIOR OR SCHOOL CLIMATE. SUSPENSIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES SUCH AS LAW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCES HIGHER RATES HAVE DROPPED OUT FAILURES TO GRADUATE ON TIME DECREASE ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT AND FUTURE DISCIPLINARY EXCLUSION. NOW WE WANT STUDENTS ANSWERED THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OF BEING TAKEN HEALTH CLASS AS A FORM OF DISCIPLINE. CAUSING THEM TO FALL BEHIND IN CLASS WHICH IS FULL OF ANXIETY AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RE OFFENDING. CLEARLY THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM IS FLAWED AND THE PUNISHMENTS OF STUDENT ACTIONS SUCH AS SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION HAVE VERY MINIMAL POSITIVE EFFECT IN THE LONG TERM. THE DISSIDENT DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM IN PLACE TODAY ONLY EXIST DUE TO TRADITION THE EDUCATION SYSTEM CONTINUES TO UC'S PRACTICES SIMPLY BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HOUSE BUT IT IS TIME TO CHANGE. FOR THE BETTERMENT OF STUDENTS AND THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE A PART OF. BUT WE ARE PROPOSING TO YOU TODAY IS A SOLUTION FOR THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL THESE DISPARITIES WERE SORT OF JUSTICE. RESTORED OF JUSTICE. IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO DISCIPLINE THE LOOK THAT HEALING% AS A MEANS OF RECONCILIATION. THIS SYSTEM FOCUSES ON ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THEY ARE GUIDED THROUGH METHODS INCLUDING WERE SORT OF CIRCLES DIALOGUE CIRCLES PEER JURIES MEDIATION. AND CONFERENCING BY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. WELL WE RECOGNIZE SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS ARE NECESSARY FORMS OF DISCIPLINE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITION OF A SORT OF JUSTICE TO THESE CONSEQUENCES IS SUPERIOR AND MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE SCHOOL AND DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM. SADISTIC SHOW THAT RESTORED OF JUSTICE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES THE SCHOOL SUSPENSION RATES AND THE NUMBER OF REPEAT OFFENSES COMMITTED BY STUDENTS. AND MERCER COUNTY ALONE SUSPENSION RATES DECREASED BY FORTY PERCENT AFTER SORT OF JUSTICE WAS IMPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION A STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE YOUTH VIOLENCE JUVENILE SO JUSTICE STATED THAT ONE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WERE USED. THE RECIDIVISM ATE WAS FIFTY PERCENT BUT AFTER SORT OF JUSTICE TRAINING THIS PERCENTAGE DROPPED TO THIRTY ONE PERCENT. IN ONE SPECIFIC CASE ASSUME IT OAKLAND UNIFIED JACOB MATHIS HER GPA OF POINT SEVEN SEVEN AND SEVERE ANGER ISSUES. AFTER BEING CHARGED WITH ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. MATHIS UNDERWENT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND AS YOU LAUP ROLE. DURING THIS PROCESS HE LEARNED THE PORTS OF ACADEMICS AND RESPECT WHICH MOTIVATED HIM TO INCREASE HIS GPA. THREE POINT TWO SEVEN. ALL WHILE RESOLVING HAS SEVERE ANGER ISSUES. MATHIS THEN PROCEEDED TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA TO IT TO STUDY MARINE BIOLOGY. CLEARLY RESTORED OF JUSTICE HAS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE ONE'S LIFE REGARDLESS OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ISSUE. THIS REINFORCES HOW RESTORED OF JUSTICE SHOWS AYE MINISTRATIONS CAN CARE FOR THE PERSONAL GROWTH OF THEIR STUDENTS. WE ADVOCATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS SHOULD CREATE A COMPETITIVE GRANT TO BE AWARDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO CAN BEST PROPOSED RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE BETTERMENT OF. IT OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL SUPPORTER FIND AND OVERSEE THE SUCCESS OF CHOSEN APPLICANTS. THIS GRANT WOULD SERVE AS INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TRANSITION FROM THE CURRENT DISCIPLINARY MATHIS TO SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THIS GRANT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE RENEWED BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF THE START OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS. IMPLEMENTED FROM THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS. ADDITIONALLY THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AWARDED IN THE GRANT ARE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. FURTHERMORE DISTRICTS THAT APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS MUST SUBMIT AN APPLICATION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BEFORE OR IN ADDITION TO CASES OF SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION. THIS WOULD EXCLUDE CASES IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE SUBJECTED TIME IN A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WOULD BE ENACTED BY THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AND ALL DISCIPLINARY INCIDENTS TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AND THEY UNIQUE SITUATIONS. WE UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT GOVERNOR BROWN'S EMPHASIS ON LOCAL CONTROL. THEREFORE OUR PROPOSAL GIVES EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT THE JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE HOW RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WELL BEING OVERSEEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WELL RESTORATIVE JUSTICE REQUIRES CHAIN PROFESSIONALS TO FACILITATE MEDIATION PROGRAMS THIS COST IS OFFSET BY THE INCREASED STUDENT ATTENDANCE DUE TO DECREASED SUSPENSION RATES. A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE HUMAN IMPACT PARTNERS FOUND THEY COUNTY THE IMPLEMENTED RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SAVED A WHOPPING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. GIVEN THIS COST EFFECTIVENESS AND PROVEN SUCCESS THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO IMPLEMENT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BY THE MEANS OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT STATEWIDE. ADDITIONALLY THIS PROPOSAL REVERSES THE VICIOUS CYCLE BY TACKLING THE ROOT OF OFFENSES RATHER THAN SIMPLY VIA FAX. SO THAT THE PUNISHMENTS GIVEN TO STUDENTS IS RESULT IN TRUE TANGIBLE CHANGE RATHER THAN NEGLECT. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SOLVES THE PENDING ISSUE OF THE INEFFECTIVENESS IN DISCIPLINE WHILE IMPOSING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. THE US WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON A MATTER IN NEED OF REFORMATION. THAT WE STUDENTS VIEW AS IMPERATIVEFOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SCHOOLS STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE'RE KNOWLEDGE OPEN THE FLOOR TO ANY QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY WELL PRESENTED AND RESEARCHED WERE THERE ANY. QUESTIONS OR. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE OF IT BUT I I THINK IT'S A VERY WHERE THE ISSUE AND I THINK YOU ALL. DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE OF IT I THINK ONE AND IT IS YOU CAN SEE AND YOU ALLUDED R. ARE MENTIONED SIX. LEGISLATIVE BILLS AND ONE PROPOSITION THAT. IS DIRECTLY RELATED OR OR OR OR SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THIS ISSUE SO AS TO CLEARLY AN ISSUE THAT NOT ONLY THE LEGISLATURE TAKE SERIOUSLY. AS A BUT UP WITH TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE DO AS WELL. I I THINK THAT. THOUGH THE LAST WHO GONNA LAST COMMENTS MADE IS THAT THERE IS A COUNTY THAT SHOWS SAVINGS UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND I THINK THAT IF WE CAN GET MORE STUDENTS. WHO TO WORK ON YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE BEHAVIOR ISSUES IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY AND GET THEM? CLASS AND OF THE I THINK THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT REPLICATED HOWEVER THIS IS A ONE TIME GRANT SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW WOULD YOU. HOW DO YOU PROCEED GOING FORWARD MAKING SURE THAT YOU ATTRACT THE DATA OF HOW MUCH COST SAVINGS THERE ARE SO THAT? IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN SAY LOOK. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. OUGHT TO BE AN ONGOING GRAND BECAUSE IT SAVING THE STATE MONEY THAT WAS UP IS THAT PART YOUR PLAN TO CUT THE TRACK SOME OF THAT DATA. YES WE BELIEVE THAT. TRACKING THE FIRST GRANT THAT IS GIVEN AND SEEING HOW THE SCHOOLS WILL. HAVE A SUCCESS RATE AND DP SUSPENSION RATES THAT WOULD BE DbN. BE FOLLOWED UP BY A COULD A. CONSECUTIVE GRAND. MY GUESS IS PART OF YOUR GRANT WOULD BE TO HAVE THE AGENCY THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY THAT RECEIVES A GRANT. TO REPORT BACK ON THEIR DATA AND THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD ENCOMPASS DATA RELATIVE TO. TO STUDENT ATTENDANCE EXCEPT HER. I THINK YOU TRANSLATES INTO DOLLARS ANY EFFORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE GOOD WELL RESEARCHED. AND. BELLAMY BRING YOU THE PERSPECTIVE OF A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. AYE AYE I THINK OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR A TEACHER. SCHOOL. IS SUSPENDING STUDENTS FOR BEING LATE RIGHT. THEM IN IN FOR SOME OTHER WHAT I WOULD CALL MINOR INFRACTIONS THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM. GAY AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE THAT'S THE SCHOOL NEEDS TO CHANGE. THEIR CULTURE AND HOW THEY DISCIPLINE STUDENTS IF YOU WELL BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW JUST BEING LATER SOME OTHER MINOR INFRACTIONS ISN'T REASON TO SPEND ANY STUDENT. BUT I KNOW YOUR. YOUR YOUR CONCEPT HEARING COMPASSES MORE THAN JUST SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. I JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT MAYBE SOMETIMES THERE IS A PLACE WHERE STUDENT TO BE SUSPENDED THAT'S YOU TYPICALLY. FOR AYE LABEL STUDENT SAFETY LET'S SAY THERE'S A FIGHT ON CAMPUS RIGHT WE'VE WE KNOW THOSE HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY. AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST BEST TO REMOVE A STUDENT FROM THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT FOR A FEW DAYS TO LET THINGS COOL DOWN. OFTEN IT'S FOR THE SAFETY NOT EVEN OF OTHER STUDENTS FOR THE STUDENT WHO MAYBE IT WAS IT WOULD TO WAS WAS SUSPENDED PULLING THEM BACK. SO THEY'RE NOT IN THE IT WOULD THAT THE SCHOOL POPULATION OF THINGS COOL DOWN SO THERE IS A PLACE SOMETIMES. FORCES VENTURA SHOULD NOT BE A NORMAL COURSE OF. DIS OF. OF A DISCIPLINARY ACT. IN IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR A MINOR REASON IT SHOULD BE OR SOMETHING EGREGIOUS AND SOMETHING REALLY RELATIVE TO SAFETY OF OF OF A OR ALL STUDENTS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS HEADING DOWN THIS PATH. WE'VE DONE A LOT LEGISLATIVELY AND WITH THE BUDGET. TO ENSURE THAT WE TAKE THIS KIND OF APPROACH IS SCHOOLS REALLY THINK ABOUT WHY THEY'RE SUSPENDING OR EVEN DISCIPLINING STUDENTS. AND I CAN TELL YOU TEACHERS ARE DIFFERENT AND REALLY FALSELY ADMINISTRATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU'RE NOT TEACHERS AREN'T WRITING REFERRALS FOR EVERY LITTLE THING OUT HERE CAN TELL YOU MY CLASSROOM NUMBER THE FIRST I'M GOING TO READ A REFERRAL. MY HAS SCHOOL CLASSROOM I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE ONE. BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T WRITE THEM BUT I HAD A SITUATION WHERE I REALLY NEEDED TO ALERT ADMINISTRATION. AND I REFERRAL SUCH THAT YOU'RE REFERRING THEM ADMINISTRATION FOR A REASON BUT AGAIN THAT'S THEIR DUTY I REALLY PUT A LOT OF US ON THIS YEAR MEASURE OF. TEACHERS ARE ARE BEING WISE IN THEIR APPROACH JUST YOU JUST CAN'T BRING DOWN THE HAMMER. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEIR PEOPLE THEY MATTER AND THEIR STUDENTS RIGHT YOU NEED TO BRING THEM ALONG. YOU DON'T JUST TEACH AND SUBJECT MATTER BUT YOU TEACH HIM ABOUT LIFE I WOULD ARGUE SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE APPROACH YOU'RE CALLING FOR TODAY AND I APPLAUD YOUR RESEARCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND A SENATOR ALLEN HAS JOINED US HE IS CHAIR OF THE SENATE. EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND HE DID YOU WANNA SEE IF YOU ARE VERY TRUE WORDS THEN COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL. TWO OF THEM OUT I MAKE A POINT OF READING. THIS PRESENTATION. BUT I'M I'M JUST MONEY BY. EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH THEIR BODY AYE CHAIR OF THE SENATE. EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND OF THE HOUSE OF THE SENATE. I. WAS A STUDENT LEADER MYSELF ASSUME. MARK SCHOOL. IT'S GOT THREE TESTS FAMILY ALSO GOING ON AND THINK YEAH AND. MY MOMENTS OF. I WILL. SO. YEAH I I I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL. FOR. FOR FOLKS TO COME IN AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF IDEAS THAT HAVE COME FROM CAST THAT ENDED UP INTO A. BLONDE POLICY WHICH IS ALWAYS VERY EXCITING. AND I WOULD TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE. I'M SURE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU KNOW THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU PUT INTO THIS AS MUCH AS IT MAY BE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES AND. I'M SURE YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OUT OF IT AND. I WE'RE GETTING A LOT OUT OF IT'S YOU BECAUSE WE GET TO HEAR FROM FROM YOU AND WE GET TO HEAR FROM THE NEXT GENERATION THAT WE GET TO TO INCORPORATE A LOT OF YOUR IDEAS INTO LAW AND SO. I'M EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN HEARING EXCITED TO GET A CHANCE TO HEAR ALL THE PRESENTATIONS. GREAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR. O. WITH THAT. MISTER CAN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE OPERATE HERE WOULD DO YOU DID YOU ANNOUNCE YOUR NEXT PANELS YOU WANT ME TO HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED. OKAY OKAY WELL IF WE COULD. MOVE ON OUR. OUR NEXT PANEL. PANEL NUMBER TWO WHICH IS MENTAL HEALTH. THEN I'LL LET THE STUDENTS INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THEY COME UP. THE TABLE. GRAB A SEAT AND YOU MAY INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND PROCEED. ONE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN STEAM SENATORS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. MY NAME IS AARON GOLDBERG I'M A JUNIOR AT ACADEMY THE CANYONS IN SANTA CLARITA CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS DANIEL LOW AND I'M ALSO A JUNIOR AT NORTHWOOD HIGH SCHOOL IN IRVINE. AND MY NAME IS ZACHARY PATTERSON AND I'M IT GREATER EXTEND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO. WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS OR CAST TO DISCUSS THE STATE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH STANDARDS AND A CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE STATE A MENTAL HEALTH IS ONE OF MOST PRESSING AND TRAVELING ISSUES IN OUR SOCIETY. BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONE FIFTH OF CALIFORNIAN HIGH SCHOOLERS WILL HAVE EXPERIENCED THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ONE TENTH OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC DEPRESSION. AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL COMMIT SUICIDE. NONE OF THEM WILL HAVE DONE THE TREATMENT THEY NEEDED A DESERVED. ALL THE SPECS FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. IF POLITICAL RHETORIC AND ACTION REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY WITH IN THE PAST DECADE. WATER SUICIDE RATES STILL INCREASING. WE ATTEMPTED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AND WE CAN'T AND WE BELIEVE WE CAN LEVEL SOLUTION. WE BELIEVED THAT WE COULD CREATE MATT'S HOUSE STANDARDS IN ALL GRADES TO TEACH THOSE ON ISSUES REGARDING MENTAL ILLNESS. HOWEVER TOWARDS THE END OF OUR PROJECT OR RESEARCH TOOK A SURPRISING TURN. AS WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EDUCATION STANDARDS WE FOUND OUT THE MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION IS ALREADY. A STANDARD FOR STUDENTS AND YET AMONG THE ELEVEN OF US WORKING ON MENTAL HEALTH COMMITTEE. ONLY ONE OF US HAD RECALL RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION IN SCHOOL. WE FOUND OUT THAT TEACHERS AND DISTRICT OFFICIALS ARE HEAVILY ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE TO TEACH MENTAL HEALTH AND CONJUNCTIONS WITH THINGS LIKE NUTRITION OR SEXUAL EDUCATION. BUT THAT THIS EDUCATION IS SIMPLY LACKING. WE THINK THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS CIRCUMVENTION R. GLARINGLY EVIDENT IN THE DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE STATISTICS IN THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARDS CAN SAVE LIVES AND THE US WE ADVOCATE FOR THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL. THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION CREATE TASK FORCE TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH STANDARDS. ON THIS TASK FORCE WE PROPOSED AT THE STATE INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING IN ADMINISTRATOR A TEACHER APPARENT A STUDENT A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND A PSYCHOLOGIST. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMBINATION OF EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS STUDENTS AND PARENTS WILL SYSTEM FOSTERING A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT WHICH MAXIMIZES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TASKS. SPECIFICALLY EACH MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC CONNECTION TO ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE LIKE TO ADD THAT OUR LIST OF MEMBERS IS NEITHER COMPLETELY INFLEXIBLE NOR EXHAUSTIVE RATHER THIS LIST CAN ACT AS BOTH A ANCHORING FORCE AND A BLUEPRINT TO HELP IMPLEMENT OUR VISION. OUR SOLUTION RELIES ON A RELATIVELY BASIC CONCEPT THERE ARE GOOD POLICIES THAT EXPERTS HAVE ALREADY CREATED IN THE STATUS QUO BUT THEY CAN ONLY WORK IF THEY ARE ENFORCED INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED WE BELIEVE THAT THE CREATION OF A TASK FORCE CAN HELP CATALYZE THIS RESULT. OUR VISION OF THIS TASK FORCE WOULD BEFORE TO GO TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HOPE BUYS THEM ON HOW TO BETTER IMPLEMENT MENTAL HEALTH POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DO THINGS SUCH AS COMPILING A LIST OF BREAST BEST PRACTICES IN DISSEMINATING THEM TO OTHER DISTRICTS. WE THINK THAT A REVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH CURRICULA WOULD BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM AT ITS ROOT IN EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT MANIFEST ITSELF IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT BENEFITS TO THIS COURSE OF ACTION. FIRST THE AGE AT WHICH MOST PEOPLE GO TO MIDDLE SCHOOL IS USUALLY FORMATIVE AND I SUCH PEDAGOGICAL EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME HAVE LONG LASTING IMPACTS BOTHHELPED SHAPE THE WAY STUDENTS VIEW AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS TOWARDS. MENTAL HEALTH YOU SECOND WE THINK THAT TEACHING STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY IMPROPERLY RESPOND TO OTHERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WILL HELP KNIT TOGETHER A HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER STUDENT BODY. AND THIRD WE THINK THAT THE SCIENCE BASED PERSPECTIVE THAT THE CURRICULA CALLS FOR WOULD WITH HELP DE STIGMATIZE AND DE MYSTIFY MENTAL HEALTH MUCH LIKE HOW WIDESPREAD SEXUAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES. HOPE REMOVE THE TABOO AGAINST TALKING ABOUT SEXUALITY IN INTEREST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST TO CONVENE THIS TAX FORCED WOULD BE NEAR TO NOTHING. SAVE FOR STIPEND EXPENSES SUCH AS TRAVEL AND MEALS. A WORD THE COST FOR THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PROGRAM HOUSE FOR SAVING LIVES. DEPRESSION IS A PROBLEM THAT IS STRIKINGLY PREVALENT. AND PERSONAL TO MANY OF US. IT'S AFFECTS RIPPLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. AND FAR FAR BEYOND. ONE OF OUR DELEGATES RECENTLY SHARED AN EXPERIENCE OF THEIRS AFTER A SUICIDE AT THEIR SCHOOL. THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE WAS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. THIS GIRL WAS JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. SHE LIVED A NORMAL LIFE AND HAD FRIENDS. SHE STARTED DEVELOPING DEPRESSION AFTER BEING BULLIED. EVERYDAY SHE BEGAN TO FEEL INCREASINGLY MORE ALONE. MORE ISOLATED FROM SOCIETY. THIS DEPRESSION BEGAN TO MAKE HER LIFE FEEL WORTHLESS. SINCE SHE WAS NEVER EDUCATED ON HOW TO HANDLE THESE SITUATIONS SHE CONTINUED TO GET WORSE. I AM AWARE OF THE RESOURCES SHE HAD. SHE DECIDED TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE. THIS GIRL IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF WHY MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. TO REITERATE. WE URGE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER OUR PROPOSITION TO CREATE A TASK FORCE TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH STANDARDS. AND CONSIDER. SOLUTIONS TO REMEDY THIS FLAW IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. CREATING THE TASK FORCE HAS MINIMAL COSTS. AND POSES NO RISK. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EDUCATE FUTURE GENERATIONS. HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND HOW THE MIND WORKS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT LIVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ARE NOW OPEN TO QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU AND. A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. ONE THAT'S GROWING IMPORTANCE EVERYDAY IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ACTUALLY BEYOND. AND ONE THAT I THINK SEEING MORE ATTENTION TODAY THAT IT HAS BUT NEEDS MORE WORK. MYSELF I. SPONSOR AUTHORED A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE SET UP PROTOCOL SO THE SCHOOL SITE WHAT I MEAN BY PROTOCOLS MEANING THEY'VE. EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEIR ROLE IF THERE WAS A MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENT THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY A TEACHER. BECAUSE WHAT I FOUND IS A CLASS OUR TEACHER THAT I WOULD GO TO A COUNSELOR HEY I THINK THE STUDENTS GOT SOME SOME MENTAL ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. AND. WHAT I FOUND WAS A COUNSELOR DIDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION I HAD DELIVERED? TO THAT COUNCIL NOW WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS US I'M NOT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I CAN'T DIAGNOSE. AND I CAN'T TREAT WE DON'T WANT THAT. OKAY. BUT WE WANT A TEACHER TO BE A PARTNER. AND OR AN EDUCATOR TO BE A PARTNER. AND GETTING A STUDENT SERVICES IF THEY NEED THEM. AND WHAT I FOUND WAS WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE PROTOCOLS WHO DID WHAT ESTABLISHED SO I OFFERED A BILL THAT MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. HE VETOED IT. BUT WHAT WE DID GAY I GET THROUGH OUR LAST YEAR WAS A BILL THAT SPOKE TO SUICIDE MAKING THAT PART OF THE SCHOOL PLAN. IF A STUDENT. DOES ATTEMPT SUICIDE WHAT DO WE DO FOR THAT STUDENT AND OTHERS AT THE SCHOOL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES ARE CLUSTERS. SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT WAY AND REMEMBER AS A GOVERNOR TO WE HAVE TO GET GET AT THIS POINT HIS. TODAY HIS SIGNATURE ON A BILL AND SO IT'S IT'S IN THE PROCESS IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES CONVINCING HIM THAT THIS IS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE. THAT WE HAVE A LAW ON IT. IS CHALLENGING AS WELL BUT I JUST APPLAUD YOU FOR THIS TOPIC BECAUSE THIS TOPIC IS GROWING ASSURING HER THAT FROM THE DOCTOR IN A MOMENT. AND IMPORTANCE. AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE SOCIETY IS MOVING SO FAST IT'S COMPLEX IT'S BECAUSE SO MUCH IS GOING ON BUT AGAIN I APPLAUD YOU FOR THIS TOPIC. WITH THAT I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WISH TO COMMENT WHEN I DOCUMENTED YOU WISH TO COME DOCTOR PAN IS JOINING US. AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILEY HAS JOINED US AS WELL IF YOU JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME INTRODUCTORY WORDS IN THAT IF YOU HAD A COUPLE COMMENTS AS WELL. NOW I I'M I THINK ALL HE'S A. A REAL DOCTOR. THE JURORS DR. BUT HE'S A POSITION AND I THINK SHE TELL HIM WHERE YOU YOUR BACKGROUND IN THAT SUPPORT NO NO THANK YOU. SUFFER SO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF ALL THE STUDENTS ARE HERE IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ENGAGE AND OUR. DEMOCRACY. AND. BE INVOLVED AND AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN HELPING US SHAPE POLICY HERE SELL REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND THAT THE PREPARATION THAT THAT WOULD NEED TO THIS HEARING. SO AS. AS A MEMBER OF YOUR CHAIR UP AND DAHLE MENTIONED I'M I'M A PEDIATRICIAN ACTUALLY I. WAS FORMALLY THE MEDICAL CONSOLES FOR SEXY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SCHOOL NURSES AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. ACTUALLY I WORKED WITH THEM TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL AROUND HOW TO. WE GET THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND. BEHAVIORAL ISSUES LIKE EIGHTY HD. SO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THAT. A SCHOOL NURSES AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AROUND. AND CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF. MENTAL HEALTH AMONG STUDENTS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE TO THE LEGISLATURE I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM ASSEMBLYMAN MCDONNELL. HIS OWN AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE HIS OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS IN THIS. I WILL TELL YOU THAT AS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HOLD A HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND I'M STILL VERY ACTIVE AND MY OWN PROFESSION IS A PEDIATRICIAN I'M STILL PART OF THE AMERICAN CATCHY ETHICS COUNCIL SCHOOL HEALTH. AT BECAUSE I THINK. CHOOL HEALTH IS EXTREMELY HOW TO VOTER HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SCHOOL IN FACT WHEN OTHER THINGS I ALSO WANT TO MENTION. IS THAT I KNOW THAT BOTH THE SUMMER WE GONNA A DONALD I I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE DRAW DOWN MORE FUNDS FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND IN SCHOOL INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH. ALRIGHT BECAUSE. I APPRECIATE YOUR PROPOSAL FOR TASK FORCE. BUT I'M SURE YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE A TASK FORCE IN ITSELF AND I KNOW THAT YOU TESTIFY WILL DOESN'T TAKE MUCH MONEY. IS MERELY A TASK FORCE AND IN FACT. IF WE WANT THE TASK FORCE TO ACTUALLY MAKE A CHANGE WERE EVENTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE CAN HAVE TASK FORCE TO REVIEW THINGS BUT EVENTUALLY AFTER GOT COMPLEMENTATION RIGHT HOW DO WE GET THOSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ANY OF A STANDARD RIGHT HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT THOSE STANDARDS. SOMEONE'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MEDICAL HELP. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FACT I ACTUALLY AUTHORED A BILLS OVER YEARS AGO AYE FOR PILOT PROGRAM THE. WHERE WE WOULD GET A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND THAT'S IT IT IN IN THE IN THE PILOT SCHOOLS? TO SO THAT HELP STUDENTS BE REGULAR. THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LARGE PORTION OF US STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS TO HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL AND. SO THEY COULD BE SITTING IN THE CLASSROOM. BUT THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT BECAUSE IT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN THERE. AND IF THE SCHOOL IS NOT. PAIRED TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THEM ARE TO ADDRESS THEM THEN. WE'RE NOT THERE NOT LEARNING AND. THAT'S THAT THEN. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE STUDENT THAT'S PROB FOR THE SCHOOL THE MOST POORLY FOR THE STUDENT AND THEN OF COURSE. WHEN YOU START TALKING THE MORE. EXT NOW. ELSEVIER AND RIGHT YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN SUCH. PAIN. THAT DAY. HURT THEMSELVES OR EVEN TAKE ON LIVES RIGHT WHICH HAS A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON. EVERYONE. AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THOSE RESOURCES. TO SCHOOLS AS WELL. WE NEED TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO GIVE THEM TO FIGURE HOW DO WE. YOUNG GET PEOPLE TO THE HELP THEY NEED. IT'S ON ONE LEVEL WHAT KIND OF VEIL THINGS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SCHOOL. AT ANOTHER LEVEL. ALSO YOU MAY THINK ABOUT WHAT OR THINGS THAT. THAT WE CAN BUILD LINKAGES BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WELL. RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S CERTAIN CAPACITY WITHIN A SCHOOL SCHOOL PIETISM RUN THEIR OWN. TALENT AND AND WHAT WE DO WE INSURE THAT THEY CAN GET HELP BEYOND SO I I THINK THAT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW IT AT. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WE ACTUALLY ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO I THINK OVERLY THAT'S GOOD NEWS TO YOU. WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK. WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER SO THAT WE HAVE. THEM THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE. THE PERSON QUALIFIED PERSON NOW IN PLACE WE ALSO HAVE THE. THE PROTOCOLS ARE THE METHODOLOGY SO THAT WHEN. EIGHT. STUDENT IS IDENTIFIED WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE RIGHT. THE TEACHER THE COACH. CLASSMATES EVEN WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM THAT THERE'S A. CLEAR WAY FOR THEM TO SAY OKAY. THIS IS HOW WE CAN GET THAT PERSON HELP IS RIGHT NOW EVELYN LOOKS AROUND LIKE I'M WORRIED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. RIGHT. I'M WORRIED. I'M NOT SURE HOW TO HELP THE PERSON. AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO SAY LOOK WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS SO THAT. WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU NEED EVERY STUDENTS SUCCEED. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU DO WE HAVE OTHER. MR KILEY JUST ONE ENTERS HERE SO. YEAH I'M KEVIN KILEY. I REPRESENT THE SIX THE SAME WAY DISTRICT NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE. AND OUT HIGH AND NOT A REAL DOCTOR I'VE ONE OF THOSE FAKE JURIST OCTETS SO. I DON'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH WISDOM TO IMPART. YEAH LEAST ON THIS TOPIC IS DOCTOR AND I'VE SO I'M REALLY HERE TO LISTEN AND TO LEARN AND I REALLY APPLAUD YOU GUYS FOR. JUST FLIPPING THROUGH THIS PACKET AND OUT LISTENING TO THIS FIRST PRESENTATION WITH THAT FOR THE THOROUGHNESS AND. AND THOUGHTFULNESS THAT YOU APPROACH THIS TASK WITH AND THAT I AM A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER MYSELF AND THAT. IDEA HEIGHT TAUGHT ACTUALLY OUR COACH POLICY DEBATE INSIDE A CHANCE WE ONLY POLICY DEBATER SO I KIND OF FELT LIKE I RECOGNIZE THE CADENCE OF YOUR. TESTIMONY. AND I I I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY BENEFICIAL TO BE ENGAGING WITH ISSUES OF POLICY WHETHER THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW. OR THROUGHOUT WHAT'S LIKE THAT AT A YOUNG AGE AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OR THE EDUCATION COMMITTEES. WHICH IS YOU NOW ABOUT. KIDS AND STUDENTS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE. WELL ACTUALLY HEAR FROM STUDENTS ALL THAT MUCH SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO HAVE SO MANY OF YOU. IN THE ROOM TODAY AND I HOPE AND I REALLY LOOK FOR DETERMINING PRESENTATIONS. GREAT. SHIKARA. THE WILL AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH ANOTHER VERY INFORMATIVE ME HAS A LARGER TAKE ASPIRIN HEAVY TOPICS. A AND. YOU ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WAS SAID BY MR PATTERSON THE DE STIGMATIZING MENTAL HEALTH ANNOUNCE ILLNESS HAS A SOUL PARTNER AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL. BUT I THINK PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES TO OUR YOUTH SO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THAT. AND. YOU KNOW I THINK WE AS YOU'VE ALL ALLUDED TO WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO INFORM OUR STUDENTS OUR. TEACHERS OUR PARENTS BETTER IT'S THAT IT'S IT'S THE HOW THAT IS CHALLENGES THANK YOU FOR OFFERING UP ONE OF THE HOUSE AS AS HOW WE CAN DO THAT BETTER AND AGAIN APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU A. CHAIR ALAN YEAH I THINK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY BROUGHT UP SOME PRETTY. A VERY SERIOUS TOPIC IN OBVIOUS YOU'VE YOU'VE GRAYSON SOME REALLY TRAGIC STORIES. I GUESS MY MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS. WHAT? WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF MEN IN THEIR IN THE RESEARCH THAT YOU DID IN THE PROCESS OF OF FOR OF PLENTY OF THIS. PRESENTATION. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE STATE OF. OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS ISSUE AT THE DEPARTMENT DUCATION AND AND. I'M. WHAT IS IT ABOUT TASK FORCE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO? MAKE THINGS BETTER AS THE AS TO HOW THE STATE. APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. WE THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS JUST A LACK OF EDUCATION THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY HIGHS MENTAL HEALTH GUIDELINES. SO YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE RESEARCHING WE'RE ALL IN ONE ROOM AND NONE OF US KNEW THAT. TO STAY ACTUALLY HAS GUILIN'S ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENT COUNTY SHOULD DO. ON MENTAL. ON MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE OUT OF THE ELEVEN US OUT OF US IN THE ROOM ONLY ONE OF US HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAUGHT ANYTHING TO DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH YOU KNOW IN OUR HEALTH CLASSES OR IN OUR. MIDDLE SCHOOL HEALTH EDUCATION SO WE THINK THAT THE TASK FORCE CAN GO AROUND TO VARIOUS DISTRICTS AND SIMPLY IN ELECTED LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS OR LET LOCAL SCHOOLS KNOW THAT THESE GUIDELINES EXIST AND THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY. SHOULD OR ARE ENCOURAGED TO MEET OUR TO KIND OF HOPE ALLOW FOR BETTER MENTAL HEALTH OF THEIR STUDENT BODY OVERALL. SO TO ADD ON TO THAT WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS THAT THE TASK FORCE IS REVIEWING THIS AND THEN THEY ARE HELPING IMPLEMENT THIS THEY ARE SHOWING THESE. SPOTS IN THE THE SPOTS IN THE DISTRICTS WHERE THIS IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED AND HOW JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SUBJECT THEY HAVE THAT LARGE BUT THEY HAVE THE LARGE PACKET STATING. EVERY ALL THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE IN MATHEMATICS IF YOU'VE SEEN IT FOR I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION STANDARDS. FOR ABOUT LARGE POCKET THERE'S ONE FOR MENTAL HEALTH TO. I'VE SEEN ALL THE OTHER ONES NEVER SAW THAT ONE INTO LIFE. THOROUGHLY STARTED RESEARCHING IT MET WITH DISTRICT OFFICIALS NEVER HEARD A THING ABOUT IT. MY GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE VERY WELL DONE. VERY WELL PRESENTED VERY WELL I RESEARCHED AGAIN. NEXT WE'LL HEAR ON THE STUDENT VOICE. STUDENT VOICE OF THAT. PANEL COULD COME FORWARD. YOU MAY TAKE A SEAT AND PROCEED WHEN. READY. GOOD AFTERNOON AUDIBLE. HONORABLE. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW. NOT FELLOW BUT A JOINT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DAN JOHNSON I'M CURRENTLY A SENIOR AT PITT PIEDMONT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE EAST SIDE ME IN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SAN JOSE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. A HIGH RATING IS CHRISTINE KIM AND I'M CURRENTLY A JUNIOR ATTENDING LEE HIGH SCHOOL WITHIN THE CAMPBELL UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY. HI MY NAME IS CONNOR GUSMAN I AM CURRENTLY ATTENDING SEE CAMOUFLAGING HIGH SCHOOL WITHIN THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO. BUT HERE'S AND I POSE THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE URGE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO APPOINT A HIGH SCHOOL. STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE TO ANY TASK FORCE CONVENED TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED. THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES WOULD SERVE AS AN ESSENTIAL RESOURCE BY PROVIDING THE AUTHENTIC OPINIONS OF STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA REGARDING EDUCATIONAL ISSUES THAT PASSED FORCES OR CREATED FOR. THESE THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT SOCIO ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS THAT WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE AND WE MUST FULLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AUTHENTIC FEEDBACK FROM THESE TASK FORCES. WITH THE EAGER IN PROACTIVE STUDENTS THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA CREATES. THE INCLUSION OF STUDENTS OR STUDENTS ON A TASK FORCE WOULD BE A CRITICAL RESOURCE LEADING TO BETTER INFORM DECISIONS THAT TRULY EMBODIED. ALL OF THE VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND NEEDS OF STUDENTS ON A MORE PERSONALIZED LEVEL. ARE THE STUDENTS WHO SIT ON THESE TASK FORCES COULD ALSO SERVE AS A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR THE. SHIPPING TENER PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION IN THE INSTANCE OF MORE A LIVER LIVE VERY RONNIE THE CURRENT STUDENT MEMBER OF THE ALLIANCEOF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THE CURRENT TASK FORCE CURRENTLY CREATED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OR LOOKS AND. TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE MULTIPLE MEASURES ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM SAYS AND I QUOTE. ALTHOUGH I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT STUDENTS IN THE CAPACITY OF THE TASK FORCE. IT IS IN MY MIND WITHOUT QUESTION. I AM SUPPLYING STUDENT INPUT ONLY THE TIP THE ICEBERG. I THINK THERE'S A DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THE IMPACT. THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION HAS. ME AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK THAT HE ACTUALLY GETS. BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE HER EXPERIENCE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN PROVIDING A REFERENCE POINT TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. HAVING A STUDENT FEEDBACK ON THE STATE LEVEL IS NOTHING NEW IN FACT CREATING A DIRECT LINE OF STUDENT VOICE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HAS BEEN A COMMON OCCURRENCE. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA ALABAMA ILLINOIS MONTANA AND MANY MORE. THEY HAVE ACTUALLY STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCILS TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT THAT DISCUSS THE SUGGESTIONS MADE AT THE STATE LEVEL ON SIMILAR TO THIS IDEA STUDENTS WOULD SERVE ON THE STATE WIDE EDUCATION TASK FORCES. EXERCISING IMPORTANT ROLES AT AND I HAD IDENTIFY THAT BEST PRACTICES ULCER SERVING AS A CHANNEL OF STUDENT INPUT AND FEEDBACK TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. ON CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGICALLY DIVERSE STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THIS INNOVATIVE SPIRIT HOUSE MEMBER FLIGHT OF IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WELL. ON FOR EXAMPLE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION POMPOUS AND GRACIOUSLY CREATED A STEM TASK FORCE TO EXPLORE THE STATUS OF STEM EDUCATION AND CURRICULUM INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES PROFESSIONAL LEARNING STUDENT TESTING AND SO MANY MORE. YET ALTHOUGH STUDENTS ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCE FROM SUCH CURRICULUM NO STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE WAS ABLE TO SAY ON SUCH A TASK FORCE. ESTHER REPRESENTATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCES THAT DAY AS A PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE STATE EDUCATION HAVE HOT. BESIDES CURRICULUM TO YOU REVITALIZATION OF KATE THERE TO KIRSTEN LEADERSHIP NO STUDENTS WAS APPOITED TO THE TASK FORCE ON STUDENTS HAVE UNMATCHED PERSPECTIVES INTO THE SYSTEM OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE EFFECTIVELY. THESE ISSUES WHAT ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE STUDENT'S EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE SHOULD RECEIVE DIRECT INPUT FROM THE IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS RESOURCES AND CONTACTS THAT SURPASSED ALMOST ANY OTHER STUDENT ORGANIZATION AND MORE ALLOW STUDENTS. FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA TO RECEIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR OWN OPINIONS. THE BACKING OF THE STATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION WOULD PROVIDE THE VALUE OF STUDENT AND PUT A PREVIOUSLY UNPARALLELED LEGITIMACY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHICH SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT IS BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF STUDENT VOICE BEING INCLUDED IN THE CREATION OF BEST PRACTICES. THIS INSTITUTIONALIZED PATIENT WHAT FOSTER AN AIR OF AUTHENTICITY AND QUALITY AND PUT IT THROUGH ITS TRADITION OF RESPECTING STUDENT VOICE RATHER THAN ALTERNATIVE FORMS WHICH MAY TEMPORARILY INCREASE STUDENT VOICE. WITHOUT CONSTANT SUSTAINABLE MEASURES. THIS EDITION OF STUDENT VOICE AND AMPLE ON CRITICAL TASK FORCES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR SUCCESS. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT PEOPLE SUPPORT WHAT THEY THEMSELVES CREATE. DECISION MAKING IS IMPROVE POINT BASED ON GROUP CONSENSUS. AND NOT THEIR QUALITY OF INPUT AND PARTICIPATION OF ALL GROUP MEMBERS STRENGTHENS INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. GREATER PARTICIPATION AND SPECIFIC TASK FORCES WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDENT INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR OWN EDUCATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE UNDERSTAND THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES REGARDING SUCH A LEGISLATIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. HOWEVER IT WOULD BE A DISCREDIT TO THE DELEGATES AND THEIR AUTHENTIC CONCERNS. OF LACKING ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THEY'RE GENUINE DESIRE TO CONVEY THAT. SEVERITY OF THIS CONCERN TO ASK FOR ANYTHING LESS. IN THIS RESPECT WE CALLING YOU TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS TO REACH FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF A LACK OF STUDENT POSITIONS ON CRITICAL. EDUCATION TASK FORCES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM ISSUE. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO STRIVE WITH US TO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE PIONEER IN STUDENT VOICE AND ALLOW THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE. AND VOICE THEIR CONCERNS AND UNIQUE AND AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCES WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. MY PEERS AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OPEN THE FLOOD. THANK YOU AND VERY WELL PRESENTED AGAIN. BUT HEN I START JUST WITH THE QUESTION. HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED. THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING A STUDENT ON EVERY TASK FORCE GIVEN THAT THEY OFTEN MEET. DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. AND I ASSUME YOU'D WANT SOME GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY ALAMODOME. ON THESE TASK MEANING A STUDENT AFTER TRAVEL POTENTIALLY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DISTANCE TO COME TO THE MEETING LET'S SEE IF HER VERY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I AM HAVE YOU. THOUGHT ABOUT THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS ON. YEAH SO. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE STUDENTS ARE IN SCHOOL AND SO THEIR POSITION WOULD. PROBABLY BE MORE PART TIME BUT. THANKS TO LIKE. ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO. GETS IN AND PUT THEIR WITHOUT HAVING TO INCUR THE COST OF TRAVEL. AND. EVEN IF THEY WERE REQUIRED TO TRAVEL TO MEET AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IF THEY DID LOOK AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD BE OF NO ADDITIONAL COST AS THE STUDENT WOULD BE A REGULAR MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE WHO MAY ALSO LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GREAT GOOD RESPONSE. OTHER COMMENTS SCAR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS GREAT HAVE TO SAN JOSE. THE STUDENTS ARE REPRESENTING HERE ESPECIALLY GRADUATE OAK OF HIGH SCHOOL TO HAVE A BILL HE SAID UNION. HAS DECISION AS WELL AS HE SAID UNION TRUSTEE PATTI CORTESE HERE SO ROB WHILE REPRESENTED I APPRECIATE THAT. AND. THOUGH THAT WAS A GREAT QUESTION BY THE CHAIR AND AND FOLLOWING UP ON THAT. IN TERMS OF HUMAN WE REPRESENT SOMEONE WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS ALL THE TIME SO WERE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THAT. INTO OUR POLICY MAKING INTO TO HELP YOU. HOW WOULD YOU INSURE? THAT A STUDENT THAT'S ON THE TASK FORCE ACTUALLY GETTING FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AROUND THE STATE AND WHAT I I WOULD CAST PLAY A ROLE IN THAT. HOW DO YOU KIND OF THE ENVISIONED THAT THE REPRESENT OF IS ACTUALLY REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF STUDENTS ARE THESE GETTING FEEDBACK? I NOT JUST THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL VIA. SO I KIND OF SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE COULD APPROACH THAT BUT DEFINITELY. WITH THESE TASK FORCES RATE THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES ON THESE TASK FORCES ARE EMPHASIZING SOCIO ECONOMIC AND JEFF GRAPHICAL DIVERSE STATE SO WHETHER THAT IS THROUGH TASK OR WHETHER THAT IS THROUGH AN APPLICATION PROCESS OR. THE DISTRICT BOARD HAS A DIRECT INPUT ON WHICH STUDENTS ARE ELECTED TO BE ON THESE. TASK FORCESI THINK THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF WAYS THAT ARE PICKING GO ALONG SO THAT THAT GEOGRAPHICAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC DIVERSITY WOULD BE WELL REPRESENTED AS WELL AS. THE STUDENT THAT WOULD BE ELECTED WOULD REALLY BE ABA MODEL OF WHAT THE REST OF THE STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT ARE SAYING SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY. DIVERSE AND DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD DEFINITELY APPROACH THAT WELL. THANK YOU THINKS A PRESENTATION WONDERFUL. ACOSTA DOCTOR. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE BEING OUT OF SAID REPRESENTS MY DISTRICT. NOT AFFIRM MCCLATCHY HIGH SCHOOL HERE AND I KNOW THAT. ANOTHER YOUR CLASSMATES I THINK I'LL PUT ON THIS AS WELL SO IT'S FABULOUS. IF YOU TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON A SUMMARY. A CAR IS A QUESTION SO THERE'S. ON ONE LEVEL THERE IS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR ALL RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A STUDENT ON A TASK FORCES AND. THESE ARE STATE TASK FORCES I ASSUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE'S A MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY RECEIVE. FEEDBACK AND INPUT THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING REFLECTS AND I ASSUME AND AGAIN I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE STUDENT TERM MORE THAN ONCE DID SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY YOU REALLY TALK. IF YOU HAVE ONE STUDENT YOU HAVE ONE STUDENT ON THE TASK FORCE OR EVEN TO GET TO. THEN THE I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT OKAY SO SUPPOSE WE MOVE FORWARD NOW THERE NEEDS TO BE A STUDENT EVERY TASK FORCE. HOW'S THAT STUDENT CHOSEN. WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH IT'S DONE. AND. SO FOR EXAMPLE I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE STUDENT COUNCIL AREA MEET THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS RIGHT SO YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED BY YOUR PEERS IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND THEN YOU BECAUSE OF. VIRTUE OF THAT NOW YOU'VE ALL COME TOGETHER. WITH THIS ORGANIZATION AS PERHAPS THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S DO KNOWS AGENTS ACTUALLY EXIST. I TAKE ON THE ROLE OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR NOMINATING. THAT YOU KNOW CANDIDATES. AND THEN WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY APPOINTED. HAVE TO REPORT BACK TO THIS ORGANIZATION AND THIS ORGANIZATION WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRANSMITTING THAT INFORMATION TO ALL THE STUDENTS ACROSS. THE. THE OF THE STATE THROUGH YOUR OWN NETWORKS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. THIS. THAT THE. THIS ORGANIZATION BE WILLING TO DO TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT VOICE DOES TRULY REPRESENT THE BROAD BASE OF STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT WHO'S ACTUALLY SITTING ON THE TASK FORCE. I. SO I THINK DEFINITELY AGREE OPTION AGAIN AS HE SAID WAS. CAST OF REALLY TAKING ON THIS ROLE OF MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED IN THESE TASK FORCES ON AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE. MORE THAN. ABLE TO A ADEQUATELY REPRESENT TO TO THE FACT THAT. EVEN ON UNDERSTATE COUNCIL OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTENDED THESE CONFERENCES YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENTLY THE DIVERSITY AND. FEARS BACKGROUNDS ALL THE STUDENTS HAVE COME FROM SO I AM I THINK THAT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A GREAT OPTION IN HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT. THERE IS SOME TYPE OF. FORMAT AND SOME TYPE OF PROCESS INTO ELECTING THESE SO REPRESENTATIVES I THINK HASEBE UMP MORE THAN ABLE TO. ADEQUATELY REPRESENT ALL THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH I MEAN I THINK BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF MAKINGTHE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE STUDENTS AND SO I'VE. YOU'LL BEEN ORGANIZATION WE'VE HAD THEM. TRAINEES AYE HOW STUDENTS RESIDENTS WHATEVER IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. BUT PART OF IT IS IS THAT. IT'S NOT JUST TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAPPENS TO BE A STUDENT ON THE POND ANYBODY. THAT STUDENT NEEDS TO HAVE A MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE. FOR REPRESENTING THE BROADER BASE AND NOT JUST OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE OF WORDS WHICH IS WILLING TO TAKE ON THAT ROLE THAT DOUBT BE VERY HELPFUL AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REPRESENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR ALAN. YEAH WELL THIS IS A. TOPIC THAT'S I'M. NEAR TO MY HEART AYE I SERVED AS A STUDENT MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OFTEN SUPPORT OF REGENTS WHEN I WAS A. AT A LAW STUDENT AND DONE. YOU KNOW I I ALSO SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND I IN MY OWN HOMETOWN LATER WE HAD SOME FANTASTIC STUDENTS WHO SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND AND I ALWAYS FOUND THAT. YOU FOR THOSE THAT REALLY ENGAGED IN CONSTANTINOPLE ROLE EFFECTIVELY THEY WERE ABLE TO. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR DECISION MAKING BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. YOU KNOW THE FOLKS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN A BEEN A LONG TIME AGO AND. YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE QUITE AS. AS UP TO DATE WITH SAW THAT. CHANGING WORLD OF OF PEDAGOGY IN JUST HIS LIFE YOU KNOW I I THINK THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A YOUNG PERSON TODAY'S IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN WHEN. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. GREW UP SO I. YOU KNOW I GUESS I WOULD. I GUESS THE QUESTION THE QUESTION BECOMES HUDDLE ON THE LINE OF SENATE HANDS YOU KNOW WHAT SORT STRUCTURE WOULD YOU HAVE IN PLACE HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU ALL TO MAKE IT WORK. WOULD YOU KNOW HOW. YOU KNOW HOW HARD THE STUDENTS GET THEMSELVES UP TO SPEED. AND BECOME REALLY EFFECTIVE PARTICIPANTS I THINK THERE ARE SOME TASK FORCES THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD REALLY LEND THEMSELVES WELL TO STEAM PRECIPITATION OTHERS. THAT I. YOU KNOW ARE HARD ENOUGH TO KEEP THE ATTENTION OF EVEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW SPENT THIRTY YEARS AS PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. LET ALONE A STUDENT WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND SO I AM I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'D BE THINKING ABOUT IS. YOU KNOW HOW TO. AND THEN I AM THAT'S ACTUALLY AYE APART WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE WAY YOU PHRASE THIS IS YOUR URGING THE SUPERINTENDENTS ALSO THE SUPERINTENDENT NOT REQUIRING SO WE HAVE A SUPER DAY. WILL TAKE THE. THE THAT THE SENTIMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HEAR FROM. YOU KNOW FROM YOU AND FROM US ABOUT HOW. IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE INCREASED STUDENT. VOICE IN INPUT BUT ULTIMATELY HE'D BE ABLE TO HEAR CBO MAKE A DECISION. AS TO WHERE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THE SLOT STUDENTS AND. AND DONE SO I LIKE THAT FLEXIBILITY. OF COURSE WOULD BE UP TO US TO PUSH HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT TIME HE'S HE'S TAKING IT THINKING THAT WILL SERIOUSLY BUT. I. I DO I I DON'T BELIEVE YOU AS OUR MEMBERS IN YOU MEMBERS OF YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. NAY HAVE. HOWEVER I MANY THE THREE OF YOU SERVED ON A. LIKE A SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL ARE. BOB HOW HAVE YOU FOUND. YOUR PARTICIPATION IN A AND HE FOUND IT. DIFFICULT DANCE. AND WHAT WHAT EVENTS AND THINGS THAT YOU'VE THAT BIT OF THAT HAVE HELPED YOU BE MORE EFFECTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THESE COMMITTEES IS THE YOUNGEST PERSON THE ROOM. AND SO IS A WEIRD THING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH WOULD BE KEEPING IN MIND FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY A MEANINGFUL. EXPERIENCE FOR THE STUDENTS. I THINK SOMEBODY WHO'S AUTHENTIC TO THE STUDENT ROLE SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T NECESSARILY AFRAID TO SAY WHAT THEY FEEL. I DUNNO DEFINITELY WITHIN MY OWN SCHOOL. SAYING A HIKE WHAT I REALLY MEAN IS VERY IMPORTANT AND COMMUNICATING. YOUR IDEAS ACROSS AND THAT. THIS STUDENT LIKE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. CULMINATING LIKE RESEARCH OR ON. GETTING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO THEY'RE LIKE. NOT SURFACED REPRESENT BUT. LIKE WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES WOULD BE SO LIKE UNDERSTANDING THE STUDENT VOICE WOULD BE PART OF THEIR JOB. DESCRIPTION LIKE THE TASK FORCE BRAVE. I THINK THAT. A LOT OF TIMES I THINK ON SUCH AS HE SAID LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS OR I'M EXAMPLES LIKE THAT I'VE NOTICED THERE'S BEEN A PATTERN OF ALL OF TIMES THAT ALTHOUGH STUDENTS ARE ON IT THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY ENGAGED ALMOND THEY'RE NOT. ACTIVELY. SPEAKS SITTING UP ARE AND THE. A ADMINISTRATORS OR WHOEVER IS PART OF THOSE ABOARD ARE NOT REALLY ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT THERE STUDENT VOICE AND SO I THINK THAT ARE MAYBE ONE THING THAT REALLY AREN'T TAKING CONSIDERATION IN MIND ITSELF CREATING MAY BE. A. MAYBE LIKE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I'M STUDENT VOICE. STERN INVOICE IS. RECOMMENDED STUDENT VOICES ENCOURAGE AND STUDENT VOICES NEEDED RATHER THAN JUST BEING AN EXTRA OBLIGATE EXTRA REQUIREMENT ON YOU HAVE TO ME COME IN ORDER FOR SUCH AS AS A SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL TO ME. BECAUSE A CHALLENGE RIGHT IS THE FACT THAT. THERE'S A LOT TURN OVER WITH STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR LOS AMOUNT TIME AND OFTEN TIMES IS A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY IN HISTORY. AND A LOT OF DOCUMENTS YOU GOTTA READ SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE YOU KNOW WEEK WE GET STUDENTS INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN SLIDE AND EFFECTIVELY. WHILE ALSO. UNDERSTANDING THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT YOUNGER AND HAVE ALL THIS EXPERIENCE THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE CONSTANT. DILEMMA I THINK A. LOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF HIS OFFICE DIDN'T COME AND THEY REALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED. ON THIS TASK FORCE AND DIED SOON AS I CAN BE A CHALLENGE FOR THEM TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE NINE OR YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING YEAH SENATOR ALLEN. PERSONALLY ON A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I SERVE AS A VOTING MEMBER ON MY SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL AND ONE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WAS THAT OUR SCHOOLS ACTUALLY. WAS AN ACCESS OF ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS HOMES GIVE TO THE SCHOOL BY THE SCHOOL BOARD DISTRICT DON'T ASK ME HOW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT HAPPENED. BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE IS AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SCHOOL SITES SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL WAS TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THIS MONEY WOULD BE BUILT A NEW DRAMA DEPARTMENT NEW BUILDINGS FOR PLACING THE PORTABLES WOULD BE. PUT HYDRO STATIONS AGO ALONG THE WALLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT AS A STUDENT BEING ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS LEST INFORMED. COMPARED TO ANY OF THE TEACHERS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW WORK TWO YEARS AT THE SCHOOL BECAUSE ALL THE MATERIALS WERE PRESENTED TO EVERYONE. PRETTY MUCH AT THE SAME TIME IDEAS WERE BEING DISTRIBUTED AT THE SAME TIME AND WE WOULD INTERCHANGE INFORMATION LIKE THAT ABOUT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS. THE BEST USE OF THE MONEY. AND SOMETIMES WE ACTUALLY CAME TO AGREEMENTS YOU KNOW IN NO THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE THAT HATE. R. DRAMA DEPARTMENT OR OUR DIVE REX ROOM IS ACTUALLY REALLY UNDERPERFORMING IN THE OUTLETS A PRINTOUT OR IT IS COCKROACHES THE PAINT'S PEELING OFF. IT DOESN'T TAKE ME THAT LONG TO AND. OR LEAST THEY'VE LOST THE SENSE OF THE URGENCY OR. THE YOU KNOW THE. YEAH THE IN AND AND AND AND SOMETIMES I'VE ALSO GOTTEN TOO USED TO SAYING WELL WE TRIED IT WE TRIED WE TRY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM BEFORE AND WE CAN'T FIX IT. NO IT DID TAKE SOMETIMES A NEW FRESH VOICE. STEPPING INTO THE ROOM AND AND AND ASKING SOME OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO SUMA BEEN ANSWERED BEFORE AND WENT REALLY WELL ANSWERED. SO. LET'S GET ANSWERING AYE I'M VERY TREAT BY THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE WILL BE SPENT THE TIME LOOKING AT IT. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU. VERY WELL DONE THINKS YEAR JOB. I NEXT WILL HAVE. THE PANEL ON IMMIGRATION. YOU MAY COME FORWARD. AND WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE CHAIRMAN AND ESTEEM MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS HAVE I GUESS I GOT OF THE NASS I'M A JUNIOR IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOLDISTRICT. FROM EAST OAKLAND. HELLO MY NAME IS I WRITTEN MARAVICH I REPRESENT THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA. AND MY NAME IS BRANDON PLOWMAN I REPRESENT THE ANDERSON UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN COTTONWOOD CALIFORNIA. SO RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY. A STORY ABOUT A MOTHER OF FOUR AGES SIXTEEN ELEVEN FIVE AND TWENTY MINUTES. AND SHE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN LIFE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT HER PATH WAS NOT EASY. IN THE NINETIES WHEN SHE WAS THIRTEEN SHE FLED FROM ASSAULT. FOR IT NUMB TO YOU THE U. S. BORDER FOR THREE MONTHS ON FLAYED CHIEF LETTERS ALL BECAUSE DURING THE TIME THERE WAS A CIVIL WAR WHERE MOST OF OUR FAMILY WAS KILLED. WHEN SHE CAME TO UNITED STATES SHE ENROLLED INTO THE OAKLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND SHE EXPECTED TO RESOURCES A HIGHER QUALITY LIFE. AND AN OPEN ENDED EDUCATION WHICH WOULD HELP GROW. HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT WHAT SHE HAD FOUND OAKLAND WAS NOT READY FOR HER OR ANY STUDENTS LIKE HER. NOBODY COULD SUPPORT HER OR HER PEERS AROUND HERE. BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. EQUIPPED THERE IS NOT. ANY EQUIPPED. EQUIPPED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMMIGRANTS LIKER HOWEVER A LOT OF TIMES OF HIM SORRY. THERE WERE NO SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS FOR NEWCOMER IMMIGRANTS AS A RESULT SHE WAS PUSHED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL HOWEVER SHE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN OTHER WAYS OUTSIDE AN INSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEM. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS WOMAN IS MY MOTHER AND NOT ONLY IS SHE IS MY ROLE MODEL. TWENTY YEARS SHE HAS BEEN SUPPORTING OPEN YOU THEIR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR SUCCESS. SHE HAS WON MANY PEOPLE CALL A DREAMER AS SHE IS ALWAYS PURSUED HER DREAM. THOUGH ME AND TODAY'S YOU HEARD COULD STAY HER STORY CONTINUES AND THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION RECOMMENDS FUNDING FOR NEWCOMER PILOT PROGRAMS THAT INTEGRATE AND SUPPORT IMMIGRANT STUDENTS BY PROVIDING THEM A CULTIVATING AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT STUDENTS ARE OFF THEIR PLACE IN AND IN CLASSROOMS ARE UNEQUIPPED HELP THEM SUCCEED. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS AND THEY RECEIVE ILE DE AND YELLOW INSTRUCTION WITH INSUFFICIENT SUPPORT. AND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR PROGRESS AND BECAUSE OF THIS IT BECOMES A CYCLE IN WESTERN NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE INTO OTHER CLASSES AND ADAPT TO A NEW SETTING IN THEIR NEW HOME. CALIFORNIA ADDITIONALLY NOT ONLY IS OUR LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT THERE'S UNHEALTHY IDEOLOGIES AND STIGMA SURROUNDING IMMIGRANTS AND THE MULTIPLE ATTACKS HAS BEEN AFFLICTED TOWARDS IMMIGRANT YOUTH. THESE MINES SAYS TRANSLATE TO UNHEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS WHICH MAKE IMMIGRANT STUDENTS FEEL UNSAFE IN THEIR DAILY CLASSROOM LIFE'S. CURRENTLY THERE IS A LACK OF RESOURCES IN SCHOOLS IN WHICH. CANNOT DEAL WITH THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND THEY'RE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THEM TO DEAL WITH ALL THE STRESS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND THIS AFFECTS. THE SUCCESS OF MANY OF THE STUDENTS. IMPLEMENTING A POSITIVE PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOLS CREATE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS FOR INSTANCE ALTHOUGH EFFORTS IMMIGRANT YOU THAT OAKLAND FACE MANY OBSTACLES AND A LACK OF SUPPORT OAKLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS POSITIVELY CHANGED IN A WAY. THAT TRANSFORM THE ENVIRONMENT FOR IMMIGRANTS IN CREATING A SAFE AND COMPREHENSIVE LEARNING SPACE. MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO THEY CREATED A PROGRAM CALLED THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM TO HELP SUPPORT IMMIGRANT YOUTH IN OAKLAND. AND ULTIMATELY THE STUDENT POPULATION AS A WHOLE THIS PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY OPENING UP MY SCHOOL DISTRICT SERVES AS A PRESIDENT TO WHAT WE PROPOSE BE IMPLEMENTED IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEWCOMER PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL AND EDUCATING OUR IMMIGRANTS WHO SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HAVE MADE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. IN ESSENCE THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM% IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES NOT ONLY EDUCATION BUT SUPPORT TO IMMIGRANT STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS. THIS PROGRAM ENTAILS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING FOR IMMIGRANT STUDENTS SUPPORTS FOR ENGLISH LOOK LANGUAGE LEARNING STUDENTS WORKSHOPS ON THE PROCESS OF DOCUMENTATION AND D. STATEMENT AYE STATION ON THE CURRENT CLIMATE OF IMMIGRATION. THE SPECIFIC COURSES ARE DESIGNED TO CREATE AN IMMERSIVE AND INTEGRATIVE CULTURAL AND ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE RECENTLY IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE IDEA OF THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM IS A IMMIGRANT STUDENTS ARE OFFERED IN EDUCATION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO FEEL SAFE AND WELCOMED INTO THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. WHEN ASSESSING THE RECENT POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT PROMOTES ANTI IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT IMMIGRANT STUDENTS DO NOT FEEL SAFE AND IT IS UP TO THE EDUCATORS OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. IDEALLY THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM PROVIDES A SAFE SPACE THROUGH ITS COURSES AND WORKSHOPS LIKE HENNA MENTIONED IMMIGRANT STUDENTS MY UNDERGO LEVELS OF TRAUMA WHEN THIS ANTI IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT IS EXPRESSED BY POLITICAL FIGURES. THROUGH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH COUNSELORS THAT CAN PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR TRAUMA AFFECTED STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY WHILE ELL CLASSES AND PROGRAMS ARE IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS ALREADY. STUDENTS WOULD BE PROVIDED EXTRA SUPPORT WITH ENGLISH LEARNING THROUGH THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM. COMMON ISSUES OF THE YELLOW COURSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE THAT STUDENTS FEEL STOCK AND SEGREGATED THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER. IF OFFERED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THROUGH THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM STUDENTS CAN EXCEL AND EVENTUALLY PASSED THE ILA COURSES. THIS IS PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A THIRTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN GRADUATION RATE OF ELL STUDENTS WHO ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM. AS WELL AS ACADEMIC EDUCATION THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WOULD EDUCATE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ON THE PROCESS OF DOCUMENTATION AND ASSIST THEM IN THAT PROCESS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BOTH A LEGAL AND INSENSITIVE FOR EDUCATORS TO APPROACH STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS AND THEREFORE THIS WORKSHOP IS OPTIONAL. AND IS INTENDED AS A SAFE TOOL AND HAVEN FOR STUDENTS LOOKING FOR THIS HELP. FINALLY THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WOULD STAND AS AN ADVOCACY PROGRAM THAT DE STIGMATIZE IS IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT SURROUND THEM. AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS I UNDERSTAND THE SHAME THAT ONE CAN FEEL ONE CLASSIFIED AS AN IMMIGRANT DUE TO THE STATEMENTS THAT ARE POLITICAL FIGURES HAVE INSTITUTED SURROUNDING IMMIGRANTS. THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WOULD CREATE A RIPPLE EFFECT OF DE STIGMATIZE ASIAN BY ENCOURAGING PRIDE IN EACH STUDENT'S HERITAGE. SINCE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WAS IN EFFECT IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT A STUDENT WOULD ONLY BE INVOLVED IN THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS. FOLLOWING THEIR TIME THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM THE STUDENT WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO REGULAR COURSES WITHIN THEIR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. THIS ALLOWS FOR INTEGRATION OF IMMIGRANT STUDENTS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OPENS UP EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMIGRANT STUDENTS. IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SIXTEEN SCHOOLS AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE STUDENTS FROM ELEMENTARY TO HIGH SCHOOL HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THIS NEWCOMER PROGRAM. TO HELP INTEGRATE YOUTH INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY. THIS STATISTIC ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WHY AND HOW THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO EFFECTIVE IN OAKLAND. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AS A PRIORITY OF THE STATE WITH THE IMMIGRANT STUDENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. WITH THE RESULTS SUCH AS THE ONE SHOWN IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPLEMENTING THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM IN OTHER DISTRICTS WOULD SHOW TANGIBLE RESULTS IN CHANGING THE WAY THE IMMIGRANT STUDENTS RECEIVE EDUCATION. THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WE ARE PROPOSING IS NOT A NEW IDEA. OAKLAND UNIFIED HAS SEEN MEASURABLE SUCCESS WITH THESE PROGRAMS SINCE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPEN SUCCESS SHOULD BE ECHOED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ROAD RUNNER ROADMAP REPORT ON THE O. U. S. D. NEWCOMER PROGRAMS. THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING A SAFE PLACE FOR THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF THEIR SCHOOLS. AN OUT OF OVER TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE NEWCOMER PROGRAMS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AWARD OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WITH BY LITERACY PATHWAY AWARDS. FOR DEMONSTRATING HIGH LEVELS OF BILINGUALISM. EXPANDING THE NEWCOMER PROGRAMS OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS. CAN OFFER THE SAME SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF IT MOST. EXPANDING. EXPANDING HIS PROGRAMS COULD OFFER IMMIGRANT STUDENTS RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP THEM IN COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE OTHERWISE. WE ASK THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE FUNDS DO A COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS FROM THIS IMMIGRANT STUDENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. FOR THE CREATION OF THREE PILOT NEWCOMER PROGRAMS OTHER THAN THAT OF OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE HOPE THE GRANTS WOULD COVER MOST OF THE COST BUT IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT SOME LOCAL COSTS WOULD ALSO BE INCURRED. AND WE PROPOSE AT THESE TALKS BE ALLOCATED FOR IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR. WE SUGGEST THAT THREE SEPARATE GRANTS BE OFFERED TO DISTRICTS OF A LARGE MEDIUM AND SMALL STUDENT POPULATION. WITH A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THESE DISTRICTS BEING IMMIGRANT STUDENTS. TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEW PILOT NEWCOMER PROGRAMS AND DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VIABLE AND BENEFICIAL TO EXPAND ACROSS THE STATE. WE FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANT STUDENTS IS A HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE WITH TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVING BEEN BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. NOT ADDRESSING THEIR ISSUES MEANS NOT ADDRESSING THE-CONCERNS OF NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU KNOW VERY WELL DONE. OUR COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GREAT JOB. NO OBVIOUS IMMIGRATIONS BEEN A HUGE ISSUE THAT. THING WITH THE APPEARANCE SO I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING TACKLING ANOTHER VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE. AND REFERRING TO IN YOUR ANALYSIS AB SIX NINETY NINE WHICH IS THE BILL THAT I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTED. DOLLARS DESIGNED OF ATTEMPTS ICE AS STATES HERE THAT IMMIGRATION STATUS BASED COMMUNICATIONS PROHIBITED AND I CAN TO TOSS SYSTEM AND REDUCE OUR. COOPERATION FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT AND I WAS ACTUALLY AUTHORED BY HER CHAIR O'DONNELL WHO REALLY DEMONSTRATE HIMSELF AS A CHAMPION AND PROTECTING. OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SO. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS A FANTASTIC A NEW CAR NEWCOMER PRO AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF IT IS SOMEONE ELSE ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN SAN JOSE. WELL WE STARTED OFF SIMILAR AFFAIRS A PART OF THE DUTIES OF THE PART OF OUR OF THE CLIP OF THE OF WHAT WE DID. WAS WE HAD A WELCOME ORDINANCE BUT WE ALSO BACKED IT UP WITH OTHER SPECIFIC ACTIONS. AND SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND IT. IRONICALLY REFERRING TO OKLAHOMA. OKLAHOMA'S PROGRAM I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD REALLY BE IMPORTANT NOWADAYS IS IS. EDUCATING THE STUDENTS IN REGARDS TO THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AS IMMIGRANTS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OF THAT IN GENERAL. IN ARCADE TO TWELVE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF EDUCATING OURSELVES ON WHAT OUR RIGHTS ARE SO THE BACK BUT YOU IDENTIFIED THAT AS A POTENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM IS I THINK VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. DR GRANT. NO I AM I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND. YOUR IDEAS THAT YOU PRESENTED I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE ARE LIVING IN CHALLENGING TIMES FOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE. NOW ONLY IMMIGRANTS BUT THEIR FAMILIES. ACTUALLY WE HAVE. I APPRECIATE WE HAVE FOCUS ON STUDENTS WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS AND MAYBE UNDOCUMENTED BUT WE ALSO HAVE STUDENTS TO ARE US CITIZENS BUT THEY MAY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING GRANDPARENTS. AND THE THOUGHT THAT BEING SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS. IT IS ALSO YOU KNOW A BIG ISSUES WELL I KNOW WE TALKED A MENTAL HEALTH AN EARLIER PANEL. SO. A DAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY THIS. WELL HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I REPRESENT SACRAMENTO AND WE BELIEVE THAT ALL. STUDENTS SHOULD FEEL WELCOME AND THAT. DESERVE AN EDUCATION HERE AND THAT ACTUALLY. ONLY CONTRIBUTES DROWNED PROSPERITY WELL WHEN EVERYONE HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I APPRECIATE YOU PUSHING. FOR THIS PROPOSAL TO GRANT THAT OPPORTUNITY IN. AND HE JUST HAS A PILOT OFFERED THREE SCHOOLS BUT. HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO MORE THREE SCHOOLS AND I APPRECIATE THE WHICH I DO THINK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN. GREAT THANK YOU A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I MEAN THIS TOPIC IS CALIFORNIA. BOB BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY IMMIGRANTS THIS IN THE SCHOOL I CAME FROM IS OFTEN A FIRST STOP. FOR FAMILIES COMING INTO THE COUNTRY SO I WELL UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE THE US THE IMPETUS OF AB SIX NINE NINE LAST YEAR. WHICH IS REALLY THE GOAL IS TO KEEP ICE OFF OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES AMONGST OTHER THINGS. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS LISTENING AND I HAVE CHILDREN THAT WOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO I BELIEVE RIGHT. TO TO TO TICE LOOKING AFTER THEM ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS BUT I DON'T WANT AYE AYE SOME THEIR SCHOOL CAMPUS FOR THEIR SAFETY AS WELL. THIS IS NOT A PLACE WE WANT I SLEEP DO NOT BELONG ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND THAT WAS THE. REALLY THE MISSION OF THAT BILL AMONG SOME OTHER THINGS ALSO. OCCASION EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS TO FREE INADEQUATE. PUBLIC EDUCATION THE UNITED STATES AGAIN VERY IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT ARTICLES THAT PROGRAM IS INTERESTING. I KNOW SCHOOLS HAVE A VARIETY OF EFFORTS IT AS PART OF THEIR MANDATE TO SERVE ALL STUDENTS SO THEY MUST BE SERVING IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AS WELL. AND OF THIS PROGRAM HELPS THEM DO IT BETTER WILL THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WE. NEED TO LOOK AT AND IT'S NOT JUST IMMIGRANT STUDENTS HAVE QUITE FRANKLY WE OFTEN HAVE SECOND GENERATION STUDENTS THAT AND THAT BEING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHERE THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP OFTEN COMES FROM IS THAT THAT LANGUAGE CAPACITY ISSUE. SO. HOW WE SERVE THE STUDENTS IS SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO STUDY IN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ON A YOU KNOW A PRETTY STRONG APPROACH IN THE? THE DATA. AND EXAMPLES YOU'VE PRESENTED SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT. GOOD JOB. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PANEL ON ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS. THE GREEN PANEL. BUT ALL WEARING BLACK. FOR MR ALLEN. A. LOT WITH THAT. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON DISTINGUISHED SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS KEVIN FAT NOW FROM WEST COULD HIGH SCHOOL IN THE WEST COVINA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. MY NAME IS NEVIN ALSO WOODY AND I'M FROM CREDO HIGH SCHOOL IN ONE A PARK. AND MY NAME IS AVERY READ AND I ALSO REPRESENT CREEK HIGH SCHOOL AND RUNNER PARK. EVERY DAY MY FELLOW STUDENTS AND I ARE REMINDED OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT OUR GENERATION FACES. NEWSPAPER ARTICLES SOCIAL MEDIA AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OUTLETS CONSTANTLY ILLUSTRATE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE HARMING OUR PLANET. WE SEE DROUGHTS FIRES AND FLOODING. WE SEE OUR CORAL REEFS AND RAIN FORESTS DIMINISHING RAPIDLY. WE ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS BUT DO NOT RECEIVE EDUCATION ON HOW OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS TRANSLATE TO SOLUTIONS. WE STAND HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS THE NEED IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION EDUCATION. IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A PLACE FOR INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY. WHICH IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NATURAL WORLD. THAT'S THIS WE APPLAUD HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT STUDENTS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF THEIR ACTIONS ON OUR NATURAL WORLD. TO EXPERIMENTS DISCUSSIONS AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECTS. IN CONTRAST TO ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY OUR FOCUS IS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION. WHICH PRIMARILY AND THE SIZES AND EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING. IT HAS BECOME IT HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST DECADE THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE BEGUN TO NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE LIVES OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER EDUCATION ON THE MATTER HAS TO BE ADDRESSED ON THE STATE LEVEL. BUT THE RARE OCCASION THAT A SCHOOL MAY OFFER A UNIT WHICH ADDRESSES SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS. THE COURSE IS USUALLY ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE CLASSES WHICH AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE STANDARD COURSES. AND BY MENTAL ACTION IN EDUCATION IS THE PROCESS THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO EXPLORE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ENGAGE IN PROBLEM SOLVING AND TAKE ACTION TO IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT INDIVIDUALS DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND HAVE THE SKILLS TO MAKE INFORMED AND RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS ON TOPICS SUCH AS THE IMPACT OF PLASTIC CONSUMPTION AND WATER CONSERVATION. THIS SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO ADVANCE PLACEMENT CLASSES OR STUDENTS WITH MORE OPPORTUNITIES. AND BY MENTAL ACTION EDUCATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED AN OPEN FOR ALL STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. I CREATE A HIGH SCHOOL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE FIRST COURSE TAUGHT FOR EVERY INCOMING FRESHMEN. THIS MOTIVATED STUDENTS TO APPLY THE SOLUTIONS THEY DISCUSSED IN CLASS TO THEIR PERSONAL LIVES AND THE GREATER COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THIS OPPORTUNITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION. HAS IDENTIFIED A LACK OF CURRICULUM BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION IN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS AS A CRUCIAL ISSUE FACING THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. TODAY WE ARE HERE TO PROPOSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE INSTRUCTS THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. TO CREATE A MODEL CURRICULUM. IT FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION. THAT ALL CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS WOULD BE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT INTO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB CLASSES. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION EDUCATION IS DEFINED AS CURRICULUM THAT COMBINES HANDS ON EXPERIENCE. WITH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS CAN AFFECT OUR GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM. EXPERIMENT SUCH AS A SYMBOL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION LAB. DEMONSTRATE HOW ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND WATER COMBINED INTO HARMFUL CARBONIC ACID. THROUGH WORKING ON THIS LAB IN A CLIMATE CHANGE COURSE I HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON. DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION AND MANUFACTURING. NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OCEANS AND MILLION LIFE. POTENTIAL PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES COULD INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO. IMPLEMENTING WAYS CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEMS TRASH PICKUPS AND LOCAL NATURAL AREAS PLANTING TREES. AND INITIATING DISCUSSIONS ON THE TOPICS OF HUMAN IMPACT. THE CONNECTIVITY OF NATURAL SYSTEMS AND REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION EDUCATION WILL NOT ONLY BROADENS STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES BUT SERVE TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO OPPORTUNITIES IN THE RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRIES OF SOLAR AND WIND POWER. AS MENTIONED IN OUR PROPOSAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION CURRICULUM INTEGRATED INTO AN EXISTING STANDARD LAB SCIENCE CLASS. WILL ENSURE THAT EACH STUDENT BY FILLING THEIR A THROUGH G. SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD GRADUATE WITH A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEIR ACTIONS AFFECT THEIR LOCAL. AND GLOBAL COMMUNITIES. THIS UNIT BEING TAUGHT IN A SCIENCE CLASS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE INSTRUCTION OF UNIT. WOULD BE BY SCIENCE TEACHER BY DOING THIS EXTENSIVE COSTS FOR THE TEACHER TRAINING. OR INCREASED FACT INCREASING FACULTY SIZE CAN BE AVOIDED. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CONSIST OF ONE UNIT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION EDUCATION EMBEDDED WITHIN OF LAB SCIENCE CLASS. THE LENGTH OF ONE UNIT TAUGHT AT ANY POINT THROUGHOUT THE STUDENTS HIGH SCHOOL CAREER OFFERS THE DISTRICT THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHICH CLASS THE UNIT WILL BE TAUGHT IN. SOME OF THE STATEWIDE ACTIONS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY WHICH IS OUR KNOWLEDGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAS BEEN A CONVERSATION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HAS ADDRESSED IN RECENT YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TEN THE EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE CURRICULUM LAUNCH STATEWIDE EFFORTS THAT WOULD START IN KINDERGARTEN AND CONTINUE INTO THEIR SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. THIS CURRICULUM IS FOCUSED ON TEACHING SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCE THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT. SO THE PRINCIPLES TAKEN FROM THE EDUCATION AND ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE AND COULD HELP PEOPLE DEPEND ON AN INFLUENCE NATURAL SYSTEMS. ANOTHER FORM OF ACTION THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IS THERE SENATE BILL FOUR TWO FOUR WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION COMMUNITY BY THE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WHICH IS A PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY. WITH A FOCUS ON INTEGRATING OTHER FRAMEWORKS THAT REFLECT SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING. ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INITIATIVE AND THE BILL INCLUDE A FOUNDATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR A NEW CURRICULUM THAT FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION. THE CURRICULA ARE YOU EXIST DOES NOT MEET THE LEVEL OF WHAT WE DESIRE WHICH IS AT EXPERIENCE A LEARNING. AS MENTIONED ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION IS THE MEANS TO APPLY ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY WITH HANDS ON EXPERIENCE. IN THE CURRENCY OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENCE THERE'S A LOT FOR APPLYING WHAT STUDENTS LEARN TO REAL LIFE PROBLEMS. THE CARIBBEAN'S CURRICULUM SHOULD BE FOCUSED FACILITATED BY THE STATE BECAUSE IN THE EVENT THAT THOSE SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. CHOOSE TO TEACH EXPERIENCE A LEARNING. THEY'LL HAVE A RESOURCE THAT IS STANDARDIZED BY THE STATE. WITH THAT THE OPTION OF HAVING A UNIT ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION HIGH SCHOOL LABORATORY SCIENCE CLASSES. ALLOWS MORE THAN JUST AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PREVALENT ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CREATION OF THIS MODEL. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION UNIT WAS A STANDARD ON HOW STUDENTS INTERACT WITH THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM. ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HIGHLY INCREASE SHOULD UP THE SMALL CURRICULUM AND HELPS OUR STUDENTS ARE WELL PREPARED. I CAN TAKE FUTURE INITIATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. CALIFORNIA HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING ONE OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS STATES. AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UPHELD AND BE REFLECTED BY THIS ISN'T JUST THAT THE DECISIONS MADE IN EDUCATION. WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR THE FUTURE EDUCATION AND THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO ANY. ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY WELL DONE ALL OF YOU. SO IT'S FIRST QUESTION SO THIS IS NOT EMBEDDED IN ANY STANDARDS NOW OR ANY CURRICULUM THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL. EDUCATION PIECE. IN TERMS OF WHAT MANDATED MEANING THEY ARE MUST DO YOU KNOW IF IT IS. OF EMBEDDED IN THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES BUT ONLY IN THE A LEAGUE HE TRACKS SO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS. AND I KNOW I TAUGHT THIS ACTUALLY TAUGHT GEOGRAPHY WHICH WAS AN ELECTIVE. AND I EMBEDDED THIS IN MY IN MY GEOGRAPHY CLASS WHY DO A UNIT. ON GLOBAL WARMING CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATION REMEMBER WERE IN A PARTISAN ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOT EVERY OTHER NOT EVERYBODY UP HERE. BELIEVES THERE EVEN IS GLOBAL WARMING OTHER IS CLIMATE CHANGE YOU KNOW SO UNDERSTAND THAT TOO. MAYBE MISTER KILEY WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT LITTLE BED. I HAD TO DO THAT. WITH EITHER YOU COME BACK AT ME JUST A MINUTE. BUT BUT NO I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE IS THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEES ABOUT EVERY YEAR I GET ABOUT FIFTY GOOD IDEAS. RIGHT AND THERE ABOUT WHAT TEACHERS SHOULD DO IN THE CLASSROOM AND THAT THE EDUCATION CODE IS TO STACK UP THE BOOKS IS PROBABLY ABOUT THIS HIGH NOW. AND EVERY YEAR PEOPLE WANT TO GROW THAT BY ABOUT ANOTHER FOOT. THE PROBLEM IS THE DAY REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY LONGER. I'M SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I HAVE IS IS CUTTING THAT DOWN TO KEEP HERE REASONABLE NOW THE SENATE SIDE THEY WOULD HAVE IN SCHOOL TILL EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T SAY NO TO ANYTHING. BUT I I'M IN WHAT I TEND TO DO IS SAY GEE WHERE IS THE BALANCE HERE BECAUSE HIS OWN AND ONLY SO MANY MINUTES IN THE DAY BUT I. I BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT BELIEVE SHOULD BE AN EMBEDDED IN EXISTING CLASS WE SHOULDN'T CREATE ANOTHER. OUR REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION I THINK THIS COMPORTS PROBABLY WITH. SCIENCE WHICH I THINK THEY TAKE IN THE NINTH GRADE IF I RECALL CORRECTLY OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF CLASS SO I'M STILL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S BEING IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. RIGHT THE FIRES APPEARED THAT MUD SLIDES DOWN THERE THE FIRES DOWN THERE THE FLOODS DOWN THERE OVER HERE. ALL KINDS OF THINGS GOING ON SO APPRECIATE THE RESEARCH VERY WELL RESEARCH VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT A VERY VERY IMPORTANT. REALLY THINK QUESTION IS. REALLY ISN'T SHOULD WE DON'T BUT IT'S HOW. WE DON'T WHERE DO WE PUT. AGAIN WE DON'T JUST ADD THINGS ON BECAUSE WHEN I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS YOU THEYWANT AT THINGS ON BUT I NEVER SEE THEM SUGGEST. WHAT WE SHOULD TAKE AWAY AND THAT AGAIN IS THE CHALLENGE WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS FIND OURSELVES IN WITHOUT I'VE THERE MAY BE SOME COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE? DOCTOR PAN. WELL. HOUSE OR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND. I SAY I. STRONGLY AGREE WITH MY GOOD FRIEND. AND SUMMER WITHOUT CHAIR DONALD BECAUSE I RAN. RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM IN PEDIATRICS AND. COURSE EVERYONE HAD OPINION ABOUT WHAT ELSE DOCTORS ARE PEDIATRICIANS NEED TO LEARN OR SHOULD DO OUR SELF WORTH AND ALSO WE NEED TO HAVE A SPECIAL COURSE OR LECTURE WITH THAT PARTICULAR TITLE ON IT. AND. BUT THE DAY IS GETTING LONGER AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING YOU KNOW EIGHTY HOUR WEEKS CELL AND WE SPOKE AT GET THAT. SO I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK WHETHER THINGS TO LOOK BACK STEP BACK AND SAY OKAY WELL. WHERE DOES THIS? DID A DIFFERENT CONCEPTS FIT IN INTO THE CURRICULUM AND HOW DO YOU. AND HOW HOW HOW DOES IT. HOW YOU SERVE TEACH MORMON THING AT ONE TIME? SO AT AND AND HOW DO YOU PUT ALL THE BUILDING BLOCKS TOGETHER RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE I YOU SHOULD BE AND I CHEMISTRY YOU SHOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT THE FACT THAT INCREASED CARBON DIOXIDE. CAUSES MORE WARMING Y. RIGHT THAT'S A CHEMISTRY COURSE RIGHT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT IDEOLOGICAL IT'S NOT POLITICAL IT'S JUST SIMPLY. THERE'S THERE'S YOU CAN COME UP WITH THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF SCIENCE THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE POLITICS THAT SAYS YOU HAVE MORE CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE AIR YOU HAVE MUCH MORE METHANE YOU GONNA HOLD MORE HEAT. ALRIGHT THAT SIR. YOU. YOU WHY LOOK YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT EARTH SCIENCES RIGHT EXACTLY HOW THINGS HOW THAT MEETS YOUR CYCLES OR AND AND THINK. AND AND HOW DO YOU TAKE THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS. AND ONE THINGS TO LOOK BACK TO THE CREW COMES THE METER A TEACHING THAT BUT IT'S NOT LABEL THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE RIGHT HOW DO YOU TAKE THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS AND THEN MAYBE. BAY THE MISSING PART IS THE END FOR YOU PAUL THIS PIECE TOGETHER YA YOU LEARNED THIS AND CHEMISTRY LEARNED THAT NERD SCIENCE OF LEARNED THIS IN HISTORY. RIGHT AND HOW THOSE AT ALL THEN COME TOGETHER. EGGS I WOULD SAY THAT THE ONE THING THAT WE PERHAPS. AND AGAIN WHAT THE WHAT WILL IT TAKE AWAY THAT THAT PERHAPS WE HAVEN'T DONE AS GOOD A GOOD A JOB. IS. SORT OF THE SYNTHESIS AND THEN HOW DO WE THEN TAKE ACTION AND THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. I HOW BECAUSE. IT'S NOT JUST IT'S GREAT TO LEARN ABOUT IT BUT THEN THE THING IS IS THAT YOU KNOW HOW WATER WAYS FOR YOU TO THEN ACT ON THIS INFORMATION. RIGHT YOU HAVE THIS INFORMATION NOW HOW HOW WE ACT ON IT HOW DO WE. CREATE CHANGE HOW WE ADDRESS ADDRESS THAT AND HOW DO. YOU DO A STUDENTS AND THEN FEW AND AND AND IN THE FUTURE AS I IS AS. IT IS OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU CAN VOTE AND SO FORTH WHAT CAN YOU DO AND RUN FOR OFFICE BY THE WAY NEXUS VOTE. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP SHAPE THAT DIALOGUE THAT'S HAPPENING. NEXT YOU CAN DO THAT NOW EVEN GO AROUND THE DINNER TABLE HOW DO YOU SHAPE THE DIALOGUE AROUND IT. WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. BUT HOPEFULLY WE ALSO HAVE THE EDUCATION TO DISCERN WHAT THE FACTS ARE. AND THAT THOSE FACTS INFORMED THE KIND OF POLICIES AND PRIORITIES WHO WANT AND WHILE CERTAINLY THIS MAY BE THE BUILDING IT SEEMS LIKE IT ALL HAPPENS. FRANKLY IT STARTS WITH THAT ONE'S DINNER TABLE. AND EVENTUALLY IT TRICKLES AND THIS IS WHERE IT SORT OF KINDA COMES TOGETHER IN THE END BUT. AND SO EACH OF YOU COMPLAIN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT. YOU AND YOUR YOUR HERE BUT YOUR CLASSMATES ALSO NOW AND HOW WE SYNTHESIZE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES YOU LEARNED IN ALL THE DIFFERENT CLASSES BACK TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CHALLENGES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT HOW DO YOU TAKE DIFFERENT SILOS AND PULL THEM TOGETHER AND AGREE. BUT THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WELL MISTER KILEY. I'LL MAKE A SIMILAR POINT DOCTOR PAN AND I AM I AM TEMPTED TO TAKE A JOB BACK AT OUR AUGUST CHAIRMAN. BUT THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH MATERIAL TO SELECT FROM. BUT I. I'VE I'VE REALLY ENJOYED TODAY'S PRESENTATIONS. AND THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A LOT OF. REALLY IMPORTANT I ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH. AND YOU KNOW TO AND I. I I LOVE THAT EVERYONE HERE IS SO ENGAGED IN. ISSUES OF PUBLIC POLICY AND I HOPE THE OR REMAINING GAUGE BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND WE NEED THE NEXT GENERATION TO BE INVOLVED BUT TO. ECHO SOME OF A DOCTOR PEN JUST SAID YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INTO. THE TRAP ALSO THINKING THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BRING ABOUT THAT CHANGE IS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE OR THROUGH GOVERNMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW EACH YOU HAS THE ABILITY. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THESE ISSUES ON MENTAL HEALTH ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ISSUE MAY BE. EVERY DAY FOR YOUR SCHOOL FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. FOR YOUR CITY AND THERE I'M SOME OF YOU ARE TO DO. AS. A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ON AT THESE ISSUES I'M SURE AND. AS AN EXAMPLE I HAVE A STUDENT AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT TO. WANTED TEACHERS TO RECEIVE SOME TRAINING ON RECOGNIZING SIGNS THAT A STUDENT MIGHT BE SUFFERING FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO THEY THOUGHT WELL THIS IS GOING TO COST SOME MONEY SO HE PUT ON A CONCERT. AT THE SCHOOL ALL TO RAISE MONEY AND THAT THEY THEN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND GOT THE TEACHERS THE SORT OF TRAINING. SO I YOU KNOW I. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE AT THAT TIME THAT EVERYONE I HEARD FROM I'M SURE WILL REMAIN INVOLVED IN THESE ISSUES. AND IN WAYS THAT WILL HELP YOUR COMMUNITIES OUT AND I JUST WANNA THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OUT TO BENEFIT FROM THE HARD WORK YOU PUT AN. GREAT THANK YOU ANNA SENATOR ALLEN HE'S THE ADVOCATE FOR THE. A TWELVE HOUR SCHOOL DAY. RIGHT. WELL LET ME SAY A COUPLE THINGS IN DEFENSE OF THIS. FANTASY PROPOSAL FIRST OF ALL. THE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS THE CREATION OF A MODEL CURRICULUM THAT CAN THEN BE. HANDED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY WANT IMPLEMENTED AND I. SO. THERE'S NOT A MANDATE ASSOCIATED. BUT IT PROVIDES TOOLS I THINK ONE OF THE KNOW IT MEANT THAT THE CHAIRS RIGHT THAT THERE IS A CONSTANT CHALLENGE IN IN THE SENSE THAT THERE'S. A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO THROUGH THE YEARS AND THEY WANT TO ADD MORE MORE TO WHAT. WHAT WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN AND AND SHOULD BE DOING? AT THE SAME TIME BY NOT ALLOWING ANY NEW. IDEAS IN THE DOOR YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TYRANNY OF THE OLD MODEL THAT. WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW SO WE'RE STUCK WITH WHATEVER WE. WERE MANDATING. BEFORE AND THE WORLD IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AND THERE ARE ALSO IT'S OF NEW THINGS THAT NEED TO BE STUDIED IN AND THE THINGS THEY NEED TO. THAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING STUDENTS WITH YOUR THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE AREA OF EXAMPLE NOW I. I'M LIMITED US IN THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. APPS THAT THE SENATE BILL YOU MENTIONED THAT IT FOR TWENTY FOUR IS MY BILL. AND. IT WE ACTUAR ABLE TO GET SOME SUBSTANTIVE FUNDING INTO THE STATE BUDGET REALLY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SO I'D LIKE TO SEE IF MAYBE SORRY US AND CONNECT WITH OUR STAFF AND AND. MAY WE CAN INFORM YOU AS TO WHAT THE BUDGET. THE BUDGET LINE ITEM THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET. IS ABLE TO DO AND THEN TO SEE HOW IT MAY RELATE TO SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TO GET THAT I WANTED OUT AYE WONDERFUL THEM ONE CgA ONE POINT YOU MADE KEVIN. AND YOU'RE TALKING WITH THE GUY WHICH IS OF GREAT CURRICULUM THAT I'VE WORKED ON THE LITTLE BIT IN MY OWN HOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MONICA. AYE YOUR SENSES THAT IT'S NOT ACTION ORIENTED ENOUGH IS THAT A COMMENT YOU MADE ABOUT IT AND. I'M VERY FOCUSED ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT AND JUST. JUST THE CONTACTS AND JUST THE WAY OPEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. ACTION BEING TAKEN LIKE. AYE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE GOING OUT DOING DIFFERENT PROJECTS. AND. LABS LIKE THAT. OKAY SO OKAY ALRIGHT. HAVE YOU TALKED TO INVOLVE THE E. AYE EVERY OF AT AND ANDERSON YOU'LL HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO PREPARE THIS PRESENTATION BUT. WE ACROSS. I LOVED AYE MAYBE NURSING ABUSING THING TO BRING UP TO THEM AND AND SEE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT STUFF THERE I THINK THERE SOME OF DOING ITS IN THE PROCESS OF HAPPENING AND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEM TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON MORE. HANDS ON. LAB BASED CLINICAL TYPE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CURRICULUM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S. IT'S IT'S THE CLOSEST TO WHAT WE HAD ITS CAUSES BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAKE I SUPPOSE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS MORE OF A HANDS ON. ELEMENT AND. AYE AYE SUMA THAT'S FAIR AND IN SO LET'S TRY TO CONNECT YOU WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT WORK IS HAPPENING THAT AREA GET SOME OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS AS A. CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE CURRICULUM. THE OTHER THING I'D SAY IS THAT KEVIN'S LEFT BUTTON. FORTUNATELY I'D SAY HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF. WHEN I'VE A CITY SOMEONE WHO IS ENLIGHTENED ON CLIMATE CHANGE. IN SPITE OF SOME OF HIS SON. PARTY COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON DC. WIENER. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. I THINK IT WAS CHARGED TO COMMENTS OF ONE I HAD A COUPLE REPRESENT IS VISIT ME YESTERDAY ON THIS. ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM AND SO WHY THE CHAIR ECHOES SOME OF THEM OF CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS I HAD WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT HOW MUCH SACRAMENTO TELLS LOCAL DISTRICTS. THAT TEACHES WAVE AT THIS TO ONE YEAR THIS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE ACTUAL SCHOOLS THEMSELVES. TOHELP THEM FIND WAYS TO ACT AND TO HAVE TO DO WAY TO GRAB YOUR HUNDRED SO I THINK SPIRITUAL. OF US PRESSURES COMES IN BY MENTAL. POLICIES AN ENVIRONMENTAL INSTRUCTION IS IS CRITICAL. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS LOOKING KNOW THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME ONE OF THE GLOBAL LEADERS ON THE ISSUES OF DEALING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TURNING BACK CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO. SEE SOME SOME INROADS THERE AND IT'S REQUIRED US TO. IN PLACE REGULATIONS AND DO THINGS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS LIKE BY THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST STARTING TO TURN. OF THE SHIP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS JOB GENERATIONS GONNA SAVE US A AND I THINK THAT WITH WITH THIS TYPE OF. OF OF APPROACH AND ATTITUDE. AND FORTHRIGHTNESS AND AND AND WITH IT THE MINES THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS ROOM I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT TO SET THE TABLE FOR YOU TO TO REALLY TAKE OVER SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. VERY WELL DONE. ANOTHER GREAT PRESENTATION. AND. GREAT RESPONSES TO THANK YOU LIKEYOU THINK THAT MR CHAN I BELIEVE YOU WANTED TO COME BACK. DID YOU WANNA COME FORWARD ONE MORE TIME. YES. SHOP. SO. FIRST YEAR. CAN WE ALL GIVE THESE GUYS A LOT IF YOU DRIVE FLAWS IS. IF THE WORKING REALLY HARD TO DO ALL THIS AND AND I. I MEAN I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THEM THEY'VE BEEN WORKING. YOU KNOW TILL DAWN TO DUSK. FOR ON ALL THESE PROPOSALS AND. YOU KNOW JUST ALL ON BEHALF OF MYSELF ALL THE DELEGATES OF THE SABLE CONFERENCE AND. THE ENTIRETY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF CAST GUY I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU. CHAIR O'DONNELL. AND SIT AT YOUR ALLEN AS WELL AS OF THE END TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE. AS SENATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION YOU KNOW. THIS CONFERENCE HAS BEEN. IS IS JUST OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD AND I IT CONTINUES TO BE. A AN UNPRECEDENTED. OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO AUTHENTICALLY EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS TO LEGISLATORS AND. YOU KNOW WE AYE I COMMEND YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO COME AND SPEAK A AND AND OUR CONCERNS. IT WITHOUT BEING SAID WELL WE. HOPEFULLY WILL. ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE TO I SEE THESE PROPOSALS TURN INTO LEGISLATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND UP. THE OF MISTER TARA I'VE YET WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE GREAT PRESENTATIONS. I'VE WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF LEGWORK ON THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. ITEM IN THERE. IS SOME FUNDING IN THE BUDGET AYE BUT TRY TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN. WE CAN NOW PRACTICALLY AND I HOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CORE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THESE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS. BECAUSE ACTUALLY IN EACH CASE THERE THINGS HAPPENING. AT THE BUDGETARY LEVEL IN THE LEGISLATURE POLICY WISE THEY MAY NOT. I B. EXACTLY WHAT YOU PROPOSE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NOT A WAY TO TRY TO. INCORPORATES SOME OF THE CORE CONCERNS A YOU'VE RAISED INTO SOMETHING IT'S RD MOVING I'VE ALWAYS FOUND AS A LEGISLATOR. IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO JUMP ON A. YOU KNOW ON A RUN ON A ROLLING TRAIN RATHER THAN TRY TO BUILD THE TRAIN UP FROM SCRATCH SO IF THERE'S ALREADY FUNDING IN A CERTAIN AREA THAT YOU CAN THEN TAP INTO. THAT CAN BE A WAY OF IT OF OF SUBSTANTIVELY ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SO IN THE CASE RESTORED JUST RESEMBLE THOSE IS MULTI TIERED SYSTEM SUPPORT. FUNDING THAT'S IN THE IN THIS LAST BUDGET WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MAYBE YOU KNOW WE CAN ASSIST WITH. MATERNA ENCOURAGE. I THE YOU SEE SOME OF OUR FUNDING FOR. I FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS ON THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING YOUR PRESENTATION. THAT I THINK OF SOME SIMILAR THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL. ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE MAYBE ON IMMIGRATION SIDE AS WELL SO. LOVE TO LOVE TO CONNECT WITH YOU AND TALK MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN ASSIST WITH WITH SOME OF THE BUDGET PLAYS THAT ARE HAPPENING WE RUN BILLS ALL THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE'S VERY INVOLVED BILLS. BUT. BUT READ BUT MOST OF THE POWER CUT AND MANY FROM SACRAMENTO IS TO OUR BUDGET. AND THAT'S. WHERE THE MONEY IS OBVIOUSLY AND? SO MUCH ENDS UPHAPPENING OR DOESN'T HAPPEN BASED ON THE BUDGETARY DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IS A LEGISLATURE AND WITH AND OBVIOUSLY. BUT WITH THE GOVERNOR AND IN A VERY POWERFUL POSITION HELPING TO LEAD THAT PROCESS. SO I LET'S LET'S LET'S KEEP TALKING AND I JUST WANNA SAY HOW INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED THING ALL OF US ARE WITH YOUR HARD WORK WITH YOUR DEDICATION WITH THEIR. YOUR YOUR FUTURE ORIENTED PHILOSOPHY. IT'S IT'S IT'S GREAT FOR US TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS MEETING EVERY YEAR AND HEAR FROM YOU AND. I AND AND EVEN. I THINK YOU HELPED TO SHAPE THIS THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THINGS IN WAYS THAT THAT AREN'T EVEN NECESSARY GONNA BE TANGIBLE THEY'LL BE THINGS THAT'LL HAPPEN IN THE COMMITTEE. WORDS IT WITH THE BILL. I WANT IDEA THAT'LL COME TO MIND AND THEN VIA SEVERAL MONTHS LATER ALL REALIZE THAT THE IDEA CAME FROM HEARING FROM THE STUDENTS EVEN LEFT I THOUGHT I GENERATED MYSELF. SO WITH THAT. I JUST THINK YOU AND I THINK YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND LET'S KEEP IT ON. YEAH I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR DETAILED. AND HARD WORK I'M SURE YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE PROUD OF YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PROUD OF YOU. I'M SURE YOUR FAMILIES ARE PROUD OF YOU AND I KNOW WE ARE PROUD OF YOU SO A VERY WILD VERY A JOB VERY WELL DONE. AND YOU SHOULD BE PROUD YOURSELVES YOU MAJOR ORGANIZATIONAL VERY GOOD TODAY VERY GOOD SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU. AND. THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED
