THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY APPLY TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WHILE WE'RE NOT CLAIMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SCHOOLS ARE POORLY CITED INCREASING LAND USE DENSITY AND RE PURPOSING INFILL SITES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT WITHOUT SIMILAR DUE DILIGENCE.

THAT WAS TAKEN IN ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BILL AS AMENDED IS OVERLY BROAD AND OVERLY BURDENSOME ON OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS- AS MANY FOLKS KNOW OBTAINING ADEQUATE FACILITIES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS- CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME RESOURCES THE DISTRICT PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO SUCH AS LOCAL BINDING AUTHORITY LOCAL ZONING EXEMPTIONS AND EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY- THERE FOR CITING AND DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILITY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS USES PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND EXPENSIVE- WE BELIEVE ADDING THAT NEW REQUIREMENTS FROM THE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BUILT ON TOP OF THE NEWLY ADDED- LEVEL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION. SEVENTEEN TWO ONE TWO IN ADDITION TO THE RIGOROUS LINK THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS SEES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IS OVERLY BURDENSOME AND UNNECESSARY DID ACHIEVE THE ORIGINAL STATED INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH WAS AROUND AIR QUALITY- CCSA SUPPORTS ALL STUDENTS HAVING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND EDUCATIONAL FACILITY HOWEVER THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ADDING UNNECESSARY HURDLES TO DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL FURTHER LIMIT EDUCATIONAL ACCESS FOR MANY OF OUR HIGH NEED STUDENTS. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION IS NEEDED TO PROTECT EXISTING SCHOOL PROJECTS IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN ANY PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS- THE PRE DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES TAKES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RE- SAYS PARTICULARLY IN THE MOST HIGH NEED. AND HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THIS WILL RESULT THE LACK OF ANY QUALITY FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS IN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE MOST AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE- AB SEVEN SIX TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN SIX TWO IN A ROOM TWENTY FORTY.

MELCHER WE HAVE GROWN QUEUING UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MURRAY- AND THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FINRA CONCERN IN THIS AREA IT'S CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE. FROM ANY KIND OF POLLUTION I WAS INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM YOUR SPONSOR THE BAY AREA AQ M. D. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY IN THE FREMONT CASE FOR THAT- THAT PERSON STILL ON THE LINE. YES SENATOR- I AM OKAY BECAUSE I THANK YOU IN. IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY IT DID LEAVE ME A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW- THE SIGHTING OF THE SCHOOL WHICH WAS DONE BY THE CITY OF FREMONT IS THAT CORRECT SIR. YES SENATOR IT WOULD BE- THE CITY'S- PLANNING DEPARTMENT. OKAY AND IT WENT THROUGH A SEQUEL AS IT WENT THROUGH A SEQUEL PROCESS AS WELL. YES AND SO THE SHORT VERSION OF THE STORY IS THAT- IS THAT THE STRATFORD SCHOOL PURCHASED LAND FROM FROM PC ARE THAT- TCR WITH THE SELLING. BUT THEY WERE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR THEIR PERMITTED FACILITY WHICH IT HAD A DISTRICT PERMIT FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS WHICH INCLUDED- CONCRETE PLANT IN SAND AND GRAVEL AND LANDSCAPING MATERIAL BUSINESS WITH A LOT OF BUT- DIESEL TRUCKS COMING IN AND OUT OF THE FACILITY. AND ENDS SO- THE STRATFORD SCHOOL WENT TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT- AND THEN WENT THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS. AND AT THE TIME IN- IN STATE LAW. FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT IS PART OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UP FOR A- NEW SCHOOL CITING. THAT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT HAVE TO BE CONTACTED IN THE AIR DISTRICT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL PERMITTED SOURCES. PART OF THAT BAYERN MENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND THAT THE REQUIREMENT DOESN'T EXIST OUTSIDE OF BUT A PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO STRATFORD UP WITH. ENDED UP GOING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS THROUGH THE CITY. WITHOUT HAVING TO- WITHOUT HAVING TO DO THAT- DUE DILIGENCE AND- ONLY TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW ON THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL WHEN THE PARENTS BROUGHT THE KIDS TO SCHOOL THAT- THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE. THAT'S WHAT LEAVES ME CONFUSED BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL. QUALITY PROCESS. IN THE FIVE CO A IT HAS IMPACT RIGHT IT IT HAD TO HAVE AN EXAMINING THAT DOCUMENT. THAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT DIDN'T REACH OUT TO YOU IN AND THAT DURING THAT PROCESS. BUT NOT FOR THAT PROCESS AND I AND I GET A SENATOR I SHOULD I SHOULD CLARIFY WHEN YOU DO- ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ON A PROJECT. YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ON THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT AND SO THE NORMALLY UNDER UNDER SEQUEL UP. IF YOU WERE TO BUILD A SCHOOL OR SOME OTHER FACILITY YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THAT FACILITY. AND THEN THERE IS THE SO WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS HOWEVER. THERE'S THE THERE'S AN EXTRA LITTLE KICKER IS PART OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK INWARD- IN AND LOOK AT THE EFFECTS OF THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT. ON THAT FUTURE SCHOOL SITES IN THE IN THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE OPERATED IN SO IT'S NOT- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS VERSUS- BUT- TRADITIONAL UP PROJECT THAT UNDERGO SPEAK WHAT. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAN THAT. YOU WERE NEVER AWARE OF THIS PROJECT. NOT UNTIL NOT UNTIL AFTER THE- THE SCHOOL WITH THE WITH THE BILL AND IN THE SCHOOL KIDS- CAME TO SCHOOL. AND YOU THINK THAT VIOLATED ANY PROCESS- THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED EITHER BY THE CITY OR BY- THE- THE PROJECT PROPONENT THREE SEQUEL. YEAH I'D I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW CENTER I DON'T THINK IT VIOLATED- IN ANYTHING- BUT BUT I THINK. I THINK YOU CAN. INDIAN GOOD PRACTICE SITE I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE DUE DILIGENCE PART OF THE- APPROVAL OF THE SCHOOL IN THE FIGHTING BUT NO I DON'T THINK THEY VIOLATED ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR OKAY AND- I AM A LITTLE. A LITTLE- CONFUSED THAT THAT YOUR AGENCY THAT'S MONITORING. THESE ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE REGION WOULDN'T BE AWARE OF THE SCHOOL AND YOU TELL ME THAT YOU HAD NO. AWARENESS THAT THE SCHOOL WAS BEING PROPOSED AT THE SITE THAT THAT YOU'RE MONITORING OF CITY ACTIONS PLANNING DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THAT YOU YOU HEARD AND SAW NOTHING. ABOUT THIS PROJECT. OUR IT DEPT THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR IN AND- YOU KNOW THE AND SO THE BAY AREA AQ M. D. IS- IS A NINE COUNTY AGENCY AND THERE'S A HUNDRED CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES AND- AND SO WE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SPEAK WITH DOCUMENT. THAT THAT- ARE ARE CREATED IN THE BAY AREA REGION AND- AND SO THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT. THAT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON NOW. OKAY THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT INFORMATION. BY TO GO BACK TO THE AUTHOR- ONE OF THE POINTS THAT THE- THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED IS THIS ISSUE OF. A GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING CHARTER PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW COULD YOU COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT R. AND FIRST A SENEGALESE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT. AIR QUALITY DISTRICT I MEAN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OUR SHARE DECISIONS IN THE BAY AREA AND I UNDERSTAND. I TOO HAD THE SUMMER CONCERNS HOW THIS PROJECT EVEN EXISTED AND YES THIS BILL WON'T FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT ALREADY EXISTED THE SHEPHERD SCHOOL FORTUNATELY. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROSPECTIVELY MAKE SURE NO KID EVER GOES TO SCHOOL AFTER THE BILL ON A DATE OR SITE- THAT IS WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TAKING GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE. BECAUSE IT THERE SHOULD BE NO. I DON'T KNOW IF DOUBT OF WHETHER AND YOU SEND YOUR KID TO IT IN FOR A- NOTHING IT BUT A TOXIC SITE OF ANY SORT AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS. ANY LESS MISTRUST EXAMPLES I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYMORE THOSE CASES AND THERE ARE CASES OF COURSE NOW THERE'S A SOUTHEAST L. A. SCHOOL THAT IS ALSO BUILT LIKE ON TOP OR NEXT ARSENIC AS WELL AS OTHER EXAMPLES EASIER ACROSS THE STATE. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE HAPPENING ANYMORE. RIGHT BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY HAVE FOLLOWED THE EXISTING LAWS. OF THE STATE AND THEY HAVE. RAISED THE CAPITAL. AND THEY'RE UNDERGOING CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW AFTER GETTING ALL THE PERMITS ENVIRONMENTAL. BUILDING CODES ETCETERA. IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A BILL LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE GOING TO POTENTIALLY UNRAVEL THE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THERE'S AN ISSUE OR NOT- ALL THOSE AND ANY PROJECT LIKE THAT. YEAH AS MR ABBAS SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE NORMAL CYCLE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPMENT REALLY LOOKS AT EXTERNALITIES ARE PROJECT HOW THE PROJECT IMPACTS. THE SURROUNDINGS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ONLY RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS ABOUT HOW THE EXTERNALITY OF OUR IMPACT THE SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR PRIVATE CHARTERS AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN- AND I OF COURSE UNDERSTAND IT WOULD- PERHAPS BECAUSE SOME DIFFICULTIES BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STE. THE THAT THE IRA THE VIRUS SAFE FOR THE STUDENTS AND NOT JUST OF THE SCHOOLS AS SAFE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ON IN AND WHY NOT MAKE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR ANY CONSTRUCTION CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S GONE ON NOW OR- IN THE FUTURE WEARING WHITE WHY ISOLATING JUST PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOLS HERE AND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR. I THINK IT'S ABOUT CONCERNED BUT OUR BILL AS HOPEFULLY ALIGNING RIGHT NOW TRYING TO LINE THE SAFETY STANDARDS OF ALL SCHOOLS OR THE PRIVATE CHARTER OR PUBLIC SO THAT'S THE SCOPE OF OUR BILL RIGHT NOW BUT HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT OPTION FUTURE THE CENTER. BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IS- THE ASSETS PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NO PUBLIC DOLLARS BEING USED. WHICH WOULD APPLY TO PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS BILL APPLICABLE TO WRITE YOUR BILL DOESN'T SAY- THIS IS GOING TO APPLY ONLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE PUBLIC DOLLARS. I THINK IF YOU DID IT THAT WAY THEN I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T. BE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING EXPANDING IT MORE BROADLY I MEAN IS YOUR ATTENTION TO HAVE IT APPLY TO CHARTER. SCHOOLS THAT USE NO PUBLIC FUNDS. WELL I A- I BELIEVE THE- SCHOOLS ARE NOW IN SUPPORT OF OUR BILL AFTER WE CLARIFIED TO THE AMENDMENTS BEING THE PRIVATE PRIVATE SCHOOL WHICH OBVIOUSLY A 100% PRIVATE THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH ONLY RECEIVE. PUBLIC EDUCATION DOLLARS FOR THE OPERATION. OUR SUPPORT OF IT NOW AND I THINK IT'S WITHIN THE ALIGNMENT THAT WE JUST WANNA KEEP OUR SCHOOLS I TENER KID SAFE NO MATTER WHAT SCHOOL TO GO TO. RIGHT BUT I'M ASKING ABOUT IF PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE BEING USED TO CONSTRUCT THIS IS ABOUT CONSTRUCTION NOT THE OPERATION RIGHT. SO IF PUBLIC DOLLARS AREN'T BEING USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCHOOL SITE. DO YOU INTEND REALLY TO MAKE YOUR BILL APPLICABLE TO THAT. THAT SITUATION AS WELL AND IF IT IS TO ASK YOU WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT. MORE BROADLY TO INCORPORATE ANY KIND OF PRIVATE- INVESTMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. WELL AS THE BILL APPLIES IN A PLACE TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS BOB SO THAT ALSO COMPLETE PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION- I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE THE OPTION OF MORE. CHECKS ON A BOB. AS WE KNOW WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS RIGHT NOW HOW MANY HURDLES WE NEED TO. PUT INTO CONSTRUCTION OF. ALL THE THINGS I MEAN IT'S A I THINK IT'S A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER DAY. PROPS BUT I'M INTERESTED IN THIS FIELD WORK OUT TOGETHER. WELL I THINK THAT THAT LOOKED AT- I WANT TE STANDARDS TO BE IN PLACE I WANT TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS I WANT TO PROTECT EVERYBODY. AND IT IT DOES IT REMAIN SURPRISING TO ME THAT. THE BOARDS ARE NOT CONSULTED IN THE S. SEQUEL PROCESS THAT GOES ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WHATEVER CONSTRUCTION. AYE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED UHHUH- I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TREAT. ONE ONE SLICE OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORLD WHICH IS PRIVATE CHARTERS WITHOUT PUBLIC DOLLARS. DIFFERENTLY THAN THE AND- ALL THOSE OTHRS I'M JUST TRYING TO CREATE SOME CONSISTENCY. YOU RECOGNIZE INFECTED YOU. GET COMMON MOMENT AGO. TALKED ABOUT THE REGULATION. THE AD AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT DUPLICATIVE. THIS IS ALREADY BEING CAPTURED- IN PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE WHAT IT HAVE TO BE ISOLATED OUT IN YOUR BILL AND MAYBE THERE'S JUST NO REASON FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. HAPPENED BEGIN YOUR BILL THAT WAY. FOR PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT PUBLIC DOLLARS. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. WELL I MEAN I OF ALSO UNDERSTAND AND THE SENSE OF CONSISTENCY BUT I THINK IF IN THE SCOPE OF A BILL IT APPLIES TO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. OR IN BETWEEN FOR CHARTERS SO THAT'S I THINK WE'LL RECYCLE IT AND WE'RE MAINTAINING ITS ABOUT SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S THE SCOPE ARE BILL. OKAY I DO BELIEVE IT'S- AYE AYES I THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH ANALOGIC MARBLE. OKAY I WANT TO SEE- DEVICE YEARS PASSED THE GAVEL BACK THIS OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU RICHARD. FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY SOMEBODY WHO CAME OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIXTEEN YEARS AND- WORKED WITH AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS AND ALSO. WAS SECRET AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT SECRET. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST. WHO WE HAVE THE MOST REGULATIONS IN TRYING TO PROVE A PART PROJECT PROBABLY ANYWHERE IN THE NATION AND THERE MAY BE SOME PLACE THAT DOES IT MORE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE- WE'RE BEHIND IN THIS AREA. THIS BILL APPEARS TO BE YOU KNOW PUTTING PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC IN AND BASICALLY TRYING TO GO AFTER CHARTERS WHAT I SEE I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IF I'VE AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE. I LIKE SEQUEL ACTUALLY SECRET REGIONAL DESIGNER SEQUEL IS TO MITIGATE IMPACTS IF YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC YOU STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN THIS BILL IS SPLITTING HAIRS AND WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT IT'S GOING AFTER. YOU KNOW PRIVATE AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THERE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THOSE AND SO. AND WHEN YOU WERE USING THE ENVIRONMENT AS A TOOL SO FOR ME I'M AND I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WE'VE DONE A BUNCH OF A SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS IN HERE TO TRY TO GET THINGS DONE BECAUSE WE CAN'T BUILD THINGS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ON TOP OF THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO IMPACT THOSE WHO WENT THROUGH THE PAST TO GET SENATORS RECOGNIZED HAVE ALREADY. IS WHAT THE PROCESS THEY THEY'VE- THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THROUGH SEQUEL AND THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT THEY HAVE. AND THIS BILL WILL CHANGE THE GAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO THEM. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF REGULATORY LAWS- IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAFEGUARD. OUR STUDENTS AND OUR PRIVATE AND ARE QUITE FRANKLY OUR BUSINESSES SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I THANK YOU CENTER I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. I DO WHEN I COME BACK AND SOME UP SOME OF MY COMMENTS THAT. WHICH IS THAT. I DO THINK THERE'S SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE TYPES OF- MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THE STRATFORD SCHOOL AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE. YOU HAD LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. THAT WERE HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF REVIEWING THAT PROJECT APPLICATION. AND REVIEWING ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS. WAS TOGETHER AND RIGHT AND SAFE AND- AN APPROPRIATE AND- SO WHEN YOU HAVE A- AND SO FOR ME THERE'S A BREAK DOWN THERE. AND THERE THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHETHER OR NOT. THAT ONE EXAMPLE IN THE STATE SHOULD BE USED TO CREATE A BROAD SWEEPING. OBLIGATION AS PROPOSED IN YOUR BILL AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE HAD I. I THINK THAT IF YOU- APPLIED IT TOO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GRANDFATHER IN THERE. AND IF YOU- TOOK OUT PRIVATELY FUNDED PROJECTS WHICH IN ESSENCE IF YOU DON'T HAVE PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT COULD BE ANY PROJECT. BUT IN THIS CASE A SCHOOL PROJECT I THINK. IT'S A PLACE THAT I THINK YOU'D GET MY SUPPORT. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS GOOD I THINK YOU HAVE THE BEST OF. GOALS IN YOUR BILL AND DIED I'D LIKE TO SEE IT- COME TO FRUITION AND THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR ME AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING ALEX. GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY ANYTHING FURTHER INTO CLOTHES IF YOU WISH. I'LL CLOSE. OUT I JUST WANNA SAY I REALLY THINK CENTERS ARE BRING UP THE CONCERNS ARE VERY VALID CONCERNS BUT- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THESE PROCESSES IN THESE LAWS RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE FEELING AS THEIR FAILING OUR KIDS. AND YOU CAN BET THAT IF THERE WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL WITH THE SAME SITUATION THAT DESCRIBES GOING DISTRICT HAPPENED IT WILL BE UP IN ARMS. BUT THIS SCHOOL STRAFFORD IS NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE THERE'S A SCHOOL IN SOUTHEAST L. AID LIKE I MENTIONED THAT IS ALSO BEING BUILT ON OR NEAR ARSENIC IS SMALL. AND IT WAS A GREAT NBC INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT SHOW JUST HOW MANY SCHOOLS LIKE TO ACTUALLY OUT THERE. AND THERE REALLY WASN'T NOBODY UNTIL. THAT I KNOW OF UNTIL THIS INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST PIECE CAME OUT WHICH IS AFTER THE STRATFORD CASE THOUGH- THAT SHOW THE IMMENSE SCALE THIS WHERE THERE COULD BE SO MANY PUBLIC PRIVATE. AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT COULD BE BUILT NEAR THIS CONTAMINATION SITES. AND THE QUESTION IS WITH THIS BILLS DO WE WANT MORE OF THOSE THINGS. IS CLEARLY THE CURRENT PROCESSES ARE FAILING US IN A FAILURE STUDENTS. I DO THINK THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW HAVE AN- HAVE A- HIGH STANDARD OF PROOF TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR KIDS ARE SAFE. I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS BRING. SCHOOLS OF ANY SORT TO THAT SAME ALIGNMENT WHETHER THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH I REALLY THANK THEM FOR SUPPORTING MY. BILL OR PROP OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE EITHER POP. FUNDS OR- PRICE. YOU KNOW. I THINK WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS FROM THESE AROUND HAZARDS AND CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE'S JUST. A GAP GAP IN THE HOLDS THAT EXISTS NOW. CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD BE MORE. I KIND OF REALLY LOOKING INTO WHY PASS EXAMPLES HAPPENBUT LOOKING PERSPECTIVE IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR KIDS I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO PROVE IT. THAT'S WHERE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS SUPPORTING A FORTUNE WE HAVEN'T. REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS YET BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE TO A THREE. AND- I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD SO I HEARD SHE- YOU'RE EITHER AND THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS HERE AT THE MOMENT SO I THINK WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION WHEN ARCA COMMITTEES BACK TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING. OKAY. WE'RE GONNA GO TO- THAT THE LAST- THE PRESENTATION OF A BOOK TO OUR CONSULTANT THERE'S ONE MORE BILL ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENT IS THAT RIGHT AND HE'S HERE I GOT A APPEARS. LIKE MAGIC. WE'RE A- AS A LOT OF TAG TEAM GOING ON HERE TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON SO I NEED TO THE ACTING OF THE ACTING CHAIR. AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU'RE PRESENTING AB ELEVEN ELEVEN ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. AND WE WELCOME YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU A SENATORS AND MAKE THIS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AB ELEVEN ELEVEN WILL CREATE A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MEANING COMPARABLE COURSES WOULD HAVE THE SAME COURSE NUMBER AT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKE COURSES AT MULTIPLE COLLEGES WITHIN A DISTRICT OR EVEN ACROSS DISTRICTS WITHOUT A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM IT IS HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO PLAN OUT A COHERENT ROADMAP. TURNING THEIR DEGREE DIFFERENCES IN COURSE NUMBERS CAN UNINTENTIONALLY SET STUDENTS BACK SERVING AS A BARRIER TO TIMELY TRANSFER. IN FEBRUARY THE GOVERNOR'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TASK FORCE POLICE TO REPORT WHICH INCLUDED A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AIMED AT HELPING CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO DEVELOP A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO THAT STUDENTS TRANSFERRING TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS KNOW AS THEY ARE PURSUING THEIR COURSES THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS BILL IS BASED ON THIS COMMONSENSE RECOMMENDATION HAVING THE SAME COURSE NUMBER FOR COMPARABLE COURSES AT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD REDUCE UNNECESSARY CONFUSION. HE'S ADVISING REDUCE EXCESS CREDIT CANNULATION TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO TRANSFER AND EARN THEIR DEGREE SAVING STUDENTS BOTH TIME AND MONEY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE JUST MEAN THAT JASMINE PRASAD. VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND JESSE RYAN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- MODERATOR WILL GO TO YOUR- TELEPHONE LINE IS THAT WHERE I UNDERSTAND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE AND IF YOU COULD ANSWER LIKE THE BILL TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY I THINK WE HAVE. A TWO MINUTE LIMIT. FOR EACH SO WE WELCOME THE TESTIMONY NOW. GOOD MORNING CARE LATE THEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY AND GOOD MORNING SENATOR GLAZER WE APPRECIATE YOU STEPPING. CENTER LATE ABSENT. THE RYAN EXECUTIVE RIGHT BY PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TRICKS AND DIDN'T SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. I'M ALSO A PROUD FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENT. REPRESENTING PART OF AN ASTONISHING LESS THAN 3% OF STUDENTS THAT WILL SUCCESSFULLY REACH THEIR TRANSFER GOALS WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ENTERING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE- LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE GATEWAY TO OPPORTUNITY. AND IMPROVED ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. THEY ALSO SERVE A CRITICAL FUNCTION IN A DAMPING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY FOR THE LARGE BLACK IN LATIN ACT YOU CAN POPULATIONS THEY SUPPORT. MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE SEEKING TO DEFY THE ODDS AND TRANSFER WITHIN TWO YEARS OFTEN CONCURRENTLY ENROLL IN CLASSES THAT SPAN ACROSS MULTIPLE COLLEGES. AND EVEN MULTIPLE DISTRICTS AND IN ATTEMPT TO EXPEDITE THEIR PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING TRANSFER EARNING A DEGREE. I ACTUALLY WENT TO TAX CITY AMERICAN RIVER AND CONSUME THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO GET THE CLASSES I NEEDED TO REACH MY COLLEGE DREAM. TAKING A CLASSES ACROSS CAMPUSES COULD BE DESCRIBED AS MANY THINGS. THE NATION'S AMBITIONS ARE DRIVEN. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN SEEKS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS TO DESCRIBE THE CURRENT PROCESS. USING INEFFECTIVE AND COSTLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS THE EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOP THREE C. ID IS RECOGNISED IN AB ELEVEN ELEVEN. BUT C. R. U. D. AS IS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO CREATING A TRULY STUDENT CENTERED PROCESS. FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE SEEKING TO DETERMINE IF OF COURSE THAT ONE COLLEGE IT'S A CLICKABLE TOWARD THEIR EDUCATIONAL. GOALS IN ANOTHER THEY SHOULDN'T NOT HAVE TO DO DOWN AND- MULTI CA NUMBER. ORYX BY ON CAMPUS HE TRACK OF COURSE CATALOG THE CAR MALL AND- IT'S RAISES THE RISK OF UNNECESSARILY REPEATING CLASSES. FOR DECADES OUR SYSTEM HAVE DEBATED COMMON COURSE NUMBER. AND AS A RESULT THEY DESIGN PROCESSES THAT LARGELY WORK FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT MISSED THE MARK FOR STUDENTS. WE HAVE TO SAY THAT COMMON COURSE NUMBERING IS A STUDENT CENTERED IDEA AT THAT TIME HAD COME SH THE GOVERNOR'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TASK FORCE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR COMMON COURSE NUMBER EIGHTEEN AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION. THE SENATE ASSEMBLY AND GOVERNOR HAVE ALLOCATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMON COURSE NUMBERING. IN SHORT WE KNOW THAT COMMON COURSE NUMBER IN ITS BOTH A BEST PRACTICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT INSTITUTION'S LIKE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THE SECOND LARGEST DISTRICT IN THE STATE. RADWAY EXACTLY INSTITUTING COMMON COURSE NUMBERING ACROSS THEIR COLLEGES FOR VERY LITTLE COST TRYING TO THINK IT'S UNLIMITED DEFIED THE TRANSFER PROCESS FOR STUDENTS. I STRONGLY URGE ARRIVA THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS RYAN- THIS PRASAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SENATOR AUDIBLE TO MEMBER MY NAME IS JOHN AND I'M THE VICE ELECT PACKAGE DIDN'T CALIFORNIA'S RAINY COLLEGES.

CLEANLY THIS IS A BILL THAT COULD HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF TIME MONEY AND ENERGY I WAS FORTUNATE TO ATTEND LET'S. MAKE COLLEGE DISTRICT THAT IS THE ONLY DISTRICT THAT I KNOW OF THAT IMPLEMENTED COMMON CORE NUMBER. EVEN THOUGH I TEND TO AGREE TO ME COLLEGES WITHIN THE DISTRICT BECAUSE THE COMMON COURSE NUMBERING I WAS ABLE TO STAY ON A CLEAR TRANSFERABLE PASS. AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER I WOULD UNINTENTIONALLY REPEAT A CORD. MISSPELLING GIVE ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE SAME BENEFIT REPEATING COURSES AS A RESULT NOT GETTING TRANSFER CREDIT FOR THOSE COURSES HAD HAPPENED. MORE THAN ONCE I'M WITH ONLY A HUMILIATING ACCESS UNIT. KALENA TRANSFER AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THEIR FINANCIAL AID AND THERE FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. EVEN GRANTED ARE DISADVANTAGED I RECONNECTED IS NOT HOW THE CALLING CARD NUMBER AND- A VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS WITH ME COLLEGE SYSTEM I HEAR WAY TOO OFTEN OF HOW STUDENTS HAVE BEEN STUCK IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.
