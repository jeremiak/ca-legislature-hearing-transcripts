IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE USC ANNENBERG INCLUSION INITIATIVE PUBLISHED A REPORT EXAMINING THE PREVALENCE OF LATINO CHARACTERS ONSCREEN ACROSS TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE- TOP GROSSING FILMS FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I'M SORRY FROM THE REPORT FOUND IS INCREDIBLY OUTSTANDING LIKE. OUT OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED GROSSING DOMESTIC FEATURES IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS LATINO CHARACTERS MAKE UP ONLY FOUR POINT 5% OF ALL SPEAKING ROLES AND NAMED CHARACTERS. ACROSS THE ONE HUNDRED TOP GROSSING FILMS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE FORTY SEVEN FILMS WERE COMPLETELY MISSING LET THE NO CHARACTER SEVENTY FILMS WERE MISSING AT THE NINTH. NINETY FIVE MOVIES DID NOT FEATURE LATINO CHARACTER WITH A DISABILITY NINETY EIGHT WERE MISSING AT THE IN ALSO IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DOCUMENTING ANOTHER KEY. FINDING THE RAZOR OF LATINO ROLES IN POPULAR MOVIES ONLY 4% OF DIRECTORS AND 3% OF PRODUCERS IN THESE MOVIES FOR LATINOS. ONLY ONE AT THE NOT DIRECTOR WORKED ACROSS THE TWELVE HUNDRED FILMS EXAMINED MOVIES IN THE REPORT SAMPLE COMPLETELY. ERASED LATINO SPEAKING CHARACTERS FIND. THESE THESE FINDINGS TO BE INCREDIBLY TROUBLING CONSIDERING THE LATINOS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN CALIFORNIA ALONE AT THE NEST. ARE THE TOP POPULATION IN THE STATE AND SO THIS THIS INITIATIVE FOR UNSEEN APENAS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESENTATION WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES. IN OUR. INFILL.

IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE SPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE COMMUNITY ARE REPRESENTED HERE IN SAN JOSE- IN ON THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY IT'S ONE I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING A RECKONING I THINK IN A GOOD WAY IN HOLLYWOOD REGARDING REPRESENTATION CERTAINLY IS MEMBER THE API CALL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS THEY'RE NOT. A CLEARLY WHEN IT COMES AFTER IT REPRESENTATION IS ABOUT NOT JUST IN QUANTITY BUT IN QUALITY AN ACTUAL RAPTOR DECISION I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE- I'M SUFFICIENT UNSEEN LATINOS. THAT'S PART OF IT WELL IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF LATINOS THAT WE SEE IN CRITICAL ROLES ARE IMPORTANT ROLES BUT HOW TO DEPICTED AND I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT- TO THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY IN THAT AND THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT I KNOW THIS ISSUE THAT MATTERS TO I'M- SPECIALLY BEING HERE IN SILICON VALLEY WHERE. I'M NEED TO ISSUE UNSEE LEVINE AS PLAYS OUT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS- HERE IN SILICON VALLEY- IN SO- REALLY YOU HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY BEING THE CAPITAL OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA ISN'T BUT ONE OF MY THANK YOU CHAIRED THE MEMBERS FOR. THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS. THANK YOU. I DO TO POINT- YESTERDAY. HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS JOAQUIN CASTRO. CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS WHO IS ALSO ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL- ARE HISPANIC CAUCUS HAS BEEN. TAKING THIS ISSUE UP- NOT JUST FOR LATINOS BUT LATINOS IN GENERAL IN HOLLYWOOD AND SO IT'S GREAT. THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS AND SO MANY MULTIPLE LAYERS I KNOW HE'S DONE SOME REALLY FANTASTIC GROUND BREAKING WORK. IN REALLY TRYING TO HOLD- FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR LACK OF REPRESENTATION SO THAT. THEY SHOULD JUST BE SEEN AS AN EXTENSION OF THEIR GREAT WORK- AND WE'RE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START OUR PANEL SO WE'LL GET THROUGH THE FIRST FEW PANELISTS- THEY'LL TALK FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES AND THEN- WHAT WE WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA START WITH DR ANA CRISTINA REHMAN. THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AT UCLA. AND CO AUTHOR OF THE ANNUAL HOLLYWOOD DIVERSITY REPORT. PLEASE GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING- THE WORK I'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY AS PART OF A MAJOR PROJECT ON THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTR CONDUCTED AT UCLA WITH MY CO AUTHOR DR DARNELL HUNT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AND DEAN OF SOCIAL SCIENCES OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES RACE ETHNICITY AND GENDER REPRESENTATION IN TV AND FILM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE BOTTOM LINE. TODAY'S SPECIFICALLY ALL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS FROM OUR FILM REPORT THAT WE RELEASED YESTERDAY AND OUR TEAM REPORT THAT WE RELEASED LAST FALL. DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF FILMS TO ME HOW LARGE A BUDGET TO ASSIGN TO THEM HOW THEY WILL BE MARKETED AND WHO WILL BE AT THE DIRECTORIAL HOW ARE MADE BY HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVES. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE FOUND THAT THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE DOMINATED BY WHITE MEN. THERE IS ALMOST NO LAND NEXT REPRESENTATION REGARDLESS OF GENDER WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE SUITES AND HOLLYWOOD. AMONG FILM EXECUTIVES AT THE ELEVEN MAJOR AND MID MAJOR STUDIOS THERE IS NO LAND NEXT REPRESENTATION AT ALL. AMONG TV EXECUTIVES AT THE SEVENTY FOUR STUDIOS AND NETWORKS THAT WE EXAMINED THERE ARE NO LIVE NEXT CEOS AND ONLY TO LEARN AN AXE EXECUTORS AMONG SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL POSITIONS AT THAT LEVEL. ONE IS A LATINO CFO AND THE OTHER IS THAT ENOUGH PRESIDENT OF CONTENT CHIEF AND CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER FOR SEVENTEEN THAT WORKS WITHIN. THE LARGER CORPORATION. AMONG UNIT HEADS THERE ARE LESS THAN 2% LAND NEXT EXECUTIVES OVERALL AMONG THOSE ELEVEN LINE NEXT EXECUTIVES THERE ARE ONLY FIVE THAT THE AS THAT ARE AT THE UNIT HAD LEVEL. LENNOX'S ARE ALSO SEVERELY UNDERREPRESENTED IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AND BEHIND THE CAMERA AS WELL- WHAT'S MENTIONED EARLIER BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE SO LOW FOR LATIN NEXT ACTORS THERE'S OFTEN NOT MUCH GENDER DISPARITY IN OUR FINDINGS. AMONG A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR THEATRICAL AND STREAMING FILMS THAT WERE RELEASED IN TWENTY TWENTY WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 5% LAND NEXT LEADS A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF OF THEM WERE THAT THE MASS. IN ADDITION THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 6% LAND NEXT ACTORS WHO ARE PART OF THE MAIN CAST FOR THE FILM. AND AGAIN A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF OF THEM WERE THAT THE MASS SO THAT THE YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT 2% OF THE LEADS AND ABOUT 3% OF THE TOTAL ACTORS. AMONG THE TOP THEATRICAL AND STREAMING FILMS THE NUMBERS ARE WORSE FOR LATIN NEXT FILMMAKERS AND CONTENT CREATORS. THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT ABOUT 3% LINE NEXT WRITERS. AND THEY WERE ALL AT THE MOMENT. IN THE 200-018-2000 NINETEEN TV SEASON LAND NEXT LEADS REPRESENTED ABOUT 6% 27% OF LEADS AND BROADCAST CABLE AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS. I'M BINDING THEM ALL TOGETHER THERE WERE ONLY FIFTEEN THAT BEING A LEADS AMONG ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS IN OUR STUDY. WHICH COMPRISE ABOUT 3% OF THE SHARE OF LEADS. IN THE SAME TELEVISION SEASON LAST NEXT ACTORS WHO ARE PART OF THE MAIN CAST REPRESENTED 5% TO A LITTLE OVER 6% OF ALL ROLES AND BROADCAST CABLE AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS. COMBINING THEM ALL TOGETHER THEY WERE ONLY SEVENTY EIGHT LATINOS WHO ARE PART OF THE MAIN CAST OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS IN OUR STUDY WHICH COMPRISE LESS THAN 3% OF THE SHARE OF TOTAL ACTORS. SO THE NUMBERS ARE DISPIRITING BUT AS I'M SURE THE OTHER PANELISTS WILL SHARE THERE IS NO LACK OF TALENT AMONG LETTING US JUST A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY. AND A LACK OF ACCESS WHICH WILL REQUIRE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO CHANGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OVERARCHING PICTURE DR RAMON AND PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE. NEXT UP WE HAVE TIME YES THAT SHOW CREATOR AND SHOW RUNNER DIRECTOR OF VIVA ON STARS WHEN YOU'RE READY. DUNYA I CAN'T HEAR YOU. THAILAND LIKE PEANUTS NO MORE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I LOVE HEARING DOCTOR ONE OTHER TIME MY- HOLD ON TO A LOT OF HER FINDINGS- TO SHAPE A LOT OF WHAT I DO- I LET MYSELF BE A CASE STUDY I DON'T I DIDN'T BRING NUMBERS- I I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF AND- THINGS AS I SEE HIM RIGHT NOW. I WAS BORN IN AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW A LOT- I WE MOVED TO MCALLEN TEXAS WHEN I WAS. IN JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO BUST UNIVERSITY TO STUDY THEATER- THEN I MOVED TO CHICAGO AND I WAS GOING TO BE AN ACTOR BUT WHEN I GOT THERE.

COMPANY AND ALL THAT THE NAVIGATOR COMPANY CALLED DR LUNA- AND WE WROTE. WE WROTE OUR OWN STUFF- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN IS IN THE EARLY AUGHTS WE- IT WAS WHEN THE LATIN INVASION EITHER CALLING OR J. LO CAME OUT WITH ALL THE STUFF. IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS- AND THEN THE CENSUS HAD COME OUT AND THEY SAID THAT WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR LIKE THINGS LIKE 11% OF. OF ALL LIPSTICK LIKE OF PURCHASE AS LIKE ALSO LET'S. LETS US SELL TO LET THE MUSCLE SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING IN THE ZEITGEIST YOU KNOW. WHERE THEY WERE- THE ROUTE THEY WERE SORT OF TRYING TO LOOK TO US TO MAKE YOUR COMPANY DID REALLY WELL. WHICH THEN- THEN I STARTED WRITING PLACE MYSELF I LEFT ACTING- AND DOT. THAT GOT A TEN. IN AND THEN I WAS. VERY WELL PRODUCED AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT EVEN THEN. IN THE AMERICAN THEATERI COULDN'T MAKE A LIVING- EVEN BEING THE MOST PRODUCE LETTING A PLAYWRIGHT IN THE COUNTRY. THE AMERICAN THEATERS ALSO- MESSED UP WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW EQUITY. OP SO I LOOKED TO ART TELEVISION AS A LOT OF MY FELLOW PLAY RIGHTS WERE DOING SO THAT'S WHEN I CAME. OVER HERE AND I GOT STAFF TO MY FIRST SHOW ABOUT NEEDS. ARE AND- THAT WAS A HARROWING EXPERIENCE THERE ARE SOME SYSTEMS IN PLACE IN IN HOLLYWOOD I WAS I INTRODUCED DIVERSITY HIGHER. AND I WAS TOLD THE FIRST HOUR OF MY- FIRST DAY AS A TV WRITER BY ONE OF MY COWORKERS YOU DO NOT USE THAT DIVERSITY HIGHER RIGHT. AND I WAS LIKE I DIDN'T AND THE FEAR THERE'S NOT THAT THERE IS IN THAT ROLE SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THATMEANT- AND HE WAS LIKE OH HONEY AND THAT- HONEY STAYED WITH ME BECAUSE- THAT HONEY STAYED THE WHOLE OFF ALL THE MONTHS I WAS WORKING THERE BECAUSE- IT. M. WHEN I FOUND OUT WHAT DIVERSITY HIRE MANY AMENDMENT THAT- I DIDN'T COST THE STUDIO ANYTHING. WHAT I HEARD IS YOU HAVE NO VALUE SO MY I WAS THE ONLY LET THE NIGHT BEFORE- MY SISTER GLORIA CALDERON KELLETT SHOWRUNNER ONE DAY AT A TIME- CAME- JOIN THE ROOM I WAS THE ONLY THAT THE NET AND STILL. HAD NO VOICE THAT WAS LIKE. SORT OF- A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW IT WAS- THE STATUS YOU KNOW OF THIS TV WORLD THAT I HAD ARRIVED AND- WHEN. GLORIA DID JOIN- AS A JOKE OUR BOSS CALLED THE SPIC AND SPAN. IN THE ROOM AND THIS JUST HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO YEAH SO LIKE IT WAS IT WAS THAT'S LIKE THE- AND HE- IS THE LAMBIC. THAT I ENTERED YOU KNOW SO- I STUCK WITH IT BECAUSE THERE WAS MONEY IN TV AND UP. BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF THINGS MAYBE A LITTLE PRAYER MCCARTY YEAH AND LET ME GIVE HIM THE ONE WHERE I GOT MY OWN SHOW- BE THAT BUT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SHOW IF THE EXECUTIVE AT STARZ THE NETWORK THAT- GIVE ME THE SHOT WE'RE NOT NAME MONICA FERNANDES. AND THAT GO YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE CASTLE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE CHAMPIONING US BUT I DID AND SO I WAS ABLE TO GET MY SHOW UP WITH AN ALL LATINO EXPERT LET THE NAY I USE THE TERM.

THE FORMULA IS WAS JUST THERE JUST WITH THAT Z. AT THE END OF HER LAST NAME- IT WAS A BLESSING SO THEN I- BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE I SAW THE STRENGTH OF THAT AND JUST THE BEAUTIFUL WORK AND- FOR MEDIA THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER THAT WAY AND WE BUILD. OUR OWN STORIES OF WE'RE AT THE HOME OF OUR STORIES AND LOOKED AROUND A LOT OF OUR STORIES WERE BEING TOLD FOR US YOU KNOW. AND THAT IS STOCK. BUT UP. SORT OF A CULTURAL MONSANTO WHEN WE CONSUME VERSIONS OF OURSELVES. A PRODUCED BY THE DOMINANT CULTURE THEN I GO AND JOIN A ROOM. YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE END BECAUSE WE SPEAK AND SPEND BECAUSE IT'S ALL IT TRICKLE DOWN THE FENCE- EFFECT IN THAT WAY- I'M GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT I. JUST YOU KNOW I THAT THAT I STARTED- WE WROTE AND- I STARTED ALL- BUT THE NOT. IN GHANA'S I DON'T KNOW THE STATE OF IOWA MOST OF. SURE INNER LET ME ASSURE EARNERS AND HOLLYWOOD- UNTITLED AT THE NEXT PROJECT WE CALL IT AND- WE WROTE AN OPEN LETTER TO HOLLYWOOD'S DEMANDING NO STORIES ABOUT US WITHOUT US. AND MAKING OTHER DEMANDS.

YOU KNOW BUT LIKE ASK AND THEN- I ALSO- WITH MY HAVE A DEAL WITH- YOU SEE P. I STARTED AN IGNITION LAB- AND TALENT AND CURATOR FOR LETTING THIS AND WE- I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE ACTUAL- THE PROBLEM ALSO WITH SPECIALLY WITH CREATORS AND WRITERS IS THAT. IT'S HARD FOR US TO ENTER THE INDUSTRY. AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO- MOVE LEVELS SOMETIMES IT WE GET STUCK IN AND THIS INCUBATOR SORT OF IS GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS- AND I ALSO CO FOUNDED THE WRITERS ACCESS SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. ARE TRYING TO ENTER THE INDUSTRIES ALSO THAT SCRIPT COORDINATORS AND- WRITERS ASSISTANTS ARE THE ENTRY LEVEL POINT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ONE THING YOU'LL RECALL THAT IS IN HOLLYWOOD YOU KNOW- TO GIVE US THAT GIG SO WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO HELP WITH ENTRY LEVEL STUFF. AND THAT'S JUST FROM NOTICING. THAT YOU KNOW THAT SPEAKING SPEAKING SPEND LIKE DYNAMIC PERMEATES THROUGHOUT THE THAT THE INDUSTRY- I'LL STOP THEM BUT- I'M EXCITED TO HEAR IT BUT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO SAY. I THINK WE WERE EXCITED TO HEAR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS A TREMENDOUS- CASE STUDY IF YOU WELL BUT- THAT FASCINATING. EXPERIENCES I'M GLAD YOU'RE THERE DOING THIS HARD WORK. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM DO THE LEAN THAT NITA A WRITER AND CO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER ON THE FORTHCOMING SPIN OFF OF AMAZON'S THE BOYS. HI EVERYONE GOOD MORNING THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THIS TIME TO BE THE DRAW BUTTON ISSUE I AM INSANELY PASSIONATE ABOUT LATINO REPRESENTATION IN THE TV WRITERS ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE COME AFTER A MORE WONDERFUL MORE BRILLIANT TALENT UNTIL MISTER ROGERS HAS BEEN TRAILBLAZING FOR US AND SO I GIVE HER KUDOS I SENT HER LOVE- MY NAME IS TOO LEAN AND HERE I AM PORTER RICANS I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR TALKING FAST. THIS IS JUST PART OF MY CULTURAL HERITAGE SO THE QUICKER OR ONE ONE ON ME I AM A VERY PROUD WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA MEMBER AND HAVE BEEN A WORKING TELEVISION WRITER AND PRODUCER FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. MOSTLY I AM KNOWN FOR MY WORK IN THE SUPERHERO SPACE IF YOU OR YOUR KIDS HAVE WATCHED THE FLASH ON THE CW YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE MY NAME. BUT WHAT I AM MOST PROUD OF IS THAT I AM THE CO ORGANIZER ALONG WITH MY FELLOW TV WRITER DEANNA MENDEZ OF A GROUP CALLED LEASE THAT THE LEAST THAT IS A NETWORKING GROUP FOR WORKING LATINA TV WRITERS YOU CAN FIND US AT ARE VERY OBVIOUS WEBSITE. LET THE A TV WRITERS DOT COM. TNN I LAUNCHED LITERALLY SPENT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND USUALLY JUST AS A BRUNCH GROUP WHERE WORKING WITH THE NETWORK TV WRITERS COULD GET TOGETHER AND COULD NOT WORK AND DRINK AND VENTS AND WHEN WE STARTED AT LEAST THAT. THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT OF US THAT'S RIGHT FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WERE LESS THAN FORTY CREDITED LATINO TV WRITERS WORKING ACROSS OUR ENTIRE INDUSTRY EVERY. SINGLE ONE OF US FIT IN ONE BACKYARD. NO SOME THEN HAVE SEEN SOME PER. AND THE NUMBER OF WORKING WITH YOU KNOW WRITERS HAS QUADRUPLED. TODAY LOVELY SPOT HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MEMBERS. AND WHILE THAT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IT'S A START. SO AS AN ORGANIZER FOR ARE SMALL BUT MIGHTY LET THE A TV WRITER COMMUNITY I AM VERY OFTEN ASKED HOW CAN WE CREATE MORE REPRESENTATION FOR LATINOS IN TV WRITERS ROOM. ROOMS AND THEY'RE VERY OFTEN TENDS TO BE TO WORK THIS ONE THIS DESIRE TO WANT TO CREATE NEW FELLOWSHIPS AND PROGRAMS TO TRAIN ASPIRING LATINO WRITERS. AND TO THAT I SAY YES ABSOLUTELY DO WHAT EVERY BIT HELPS BUT THOSE TYPES OF PIPELINE PROGRAMS FOR ENTRY LEVEL UNDER REPRESENTED WRITERS. AEGS THIS TO NOW AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT'S HOW I GOT MY START I LITERALLY WOULD NOT BE A TV WRITER TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE NATIONAL HISPANIC MEDIA COALITION'S SERIES SCRIPT WRITERS FELLOWSHIP. AND AGENCY DOT ORG BACKSLASH WRITERS AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM BRENDA AND A BIT I CANNOT SING THE PRAISES ENOUGH OF THE AND H. M. C. EVERY YEAR THEY FOSTER A NEW CLASS OF ASPIRING LACK NEXT TV WRITERS. AND IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO GIVE THEM GIVE IT TO THEM SO THEY CAN TRAIN EVEN MORE. IN PART BECAUSE OF PROGRAMS LIKE AND AGENCIES AND SIMILAR PIPE LINE PROGRAMS N. ABC CBS AND ELSEWHERE WE ARE SEEING THIS HUGE INCREASE AND LATINOS WHO ARE GETTING THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR. 30% OF LEVY SAYS MEMBERS ARE STAFF WRITER LEVELS THAT MEANS ONE THIRD OF OUR GROUP OF WRITERS WHO HAVE ONE YEAR OF ROOM EXPERIENCE UNDER THEIR BELT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS LIKE THEM YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THE SAME WRITERS THEY'RE NOT BREAKING THROUGH THE RANKS. AND MOST OF ALL THEY'RE NOT BEING PUT IN CHARGE. LAST YEAR THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE A SCRIPTED TELEVISION SHOWS. SEVEN WERE CREATED OR CO CREATED BY A LATINA. LATINOS ARE 9% OF THE US POPULATION WE ARE BARELY 1% OF TELEVISION SHOW RUNNERS. AND THIS MATTERS SO MUCH BECAUSE IN TV THE SHOW RUNNER IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A CEO. SHOWRUNNERS. WEIGH IN ON THE HIRING OF ACTOR FIRST THREE. AND THEY FLY. EVERY OTHER WRITER THAT WRITERS FOR. AS AND THE BY THOMAS. IN TRAILED BIDA THE SINGLE BEST WAY TO INCREASE LATINO REPRESENTATION IN THE WRITERS ROOM AND ON SCREEN AND EVEN ON THE CREW IS TO PUT LATINOS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN HIRE OTHER LET. US PUT US IN CHARGE. NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY THE STUDIOS AND THE NETWORKS HAVE THE POWER TO DO BUT THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF WAYS THAT THEY CAN ACCELERATE DOING IT. THEY CAN PUT MORE LATINAS UNDER OVERALL SPIELS WERE UNDER FIRST LOOK DEALS GETTING FIRST ACCESS TO ELECTING A WRITER'S ORIGINAL IDEAS. THEY CAN OFFER MORE BLANK SCRIPT COMMITMENT SPECIFICALLY TO LATINOS BASICALLY PROMISING TO BUY A TO BE AGREED UPON STORY. THEY CAN SIMPLY COMMIT TO TRIPLING THE NUMBER OF LATINO CREATED STORIES THANK BY. AND THEN COMMITTED TO PUTTING THE STORIES ON HERE. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE STATS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SHARING TODAY CAN BE INCREDIBLY DISHEARTENING SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE THROUGH A LOT OF THE STUFF WE CAN AFFECT CHANGE JUST FIVE YEARS. AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR STARTING THIS CONVERSATION I'M OPTIMISTIC. FOR WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WOW WHAT HOW HOUSE GROUP THIS IS AWESOME- A LOT TO DIGEST BUT A LOT OF HOPE TO AT. NEXT UP WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM TERRY VELASQUEZ- IN AND I OUT SEE% LOCAL SEVEN OH SIX- UNION JOURNEYMAN HAIRSTYLIST. I'M SORRY WE USE THE TERM JOURNEYMAN STYLE- BUT THAT IS THE OFFICIAL TERM WHOSE. JOURNEY JOURNEY PERSON JOURNEY WOMAN. WHO HAS WORKED WELL FORTY NINE TV SHOWS AND FILMS- PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY TERRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU- HELLO EVERYONE AND WOW WHAT AN AMAZING GROUP OF WOMEN WE HAVE- IT INCREDIBLE- I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE INVITATION TO APPEAR TODAY- BUT YES I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FOR- FOR THIRTY YEARS OVER THIRTY YEARS STARTING OUT AT THE LA OPERA AND- BALLET MUSIC CENTER AND- I'VE BEEN- CALLED. THE DREAM AND HAIR STYLIST FOR LOCAL SEVEN OH SIX- I'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THOUSANDS OF CREW MEMBERS LIKE MYSELF WHO YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF BUT WHOSE WORK. MAKES WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN POSSIBLE AND AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD I OVERSEE ALL THE HAIR STYLIST ON SET. I'M A PROUD EXAMPLE OF THE LATINO WHO'S THE CHIEF SEVEN SUCCESS IN MY INDUSTRY- OVER MY THIRTY YEARS WORKING HERE IN LOS ANGELES I HAVE SEEN A CHANGE AND LATINO BLACK ASIAN. LBGT Q. CREW ON THE SET AND I BELIEVE THE HAIR AND MAKE UP LOCAL HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF EXPANDING INTO A MORE. DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP. I'M NOT USUALLY THE ONLY LATINA IN THEIR DEPARTMENT HOWEVER WHERE I HAVE SEEN LESS CHANGE IS LIKE WHICH I'M GOING TO ECHO WHAT GREAT WOMEN BEFORE MAY HAVE SAID. OUR THE PEOPLE IN CHARGETHAT MEANS PRODUCERS EXECUTIVE STUDIO HEADS SHOW RUNNERS. THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE HIRING AND DECIDE WHAT GETS ON THE SCREEN LATIN WOMEN ARE GENERALLY NOT PEOPLE IN CHARGE WHEN IT COMES TO ABOVE THE LINE. SOME OF THE BEARS I'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN ARE THE STEREOTYPES THAT DISTORT THE PERCEPTION OF LATINOS. RARELY IS A LATINA SEEN AS THE INTELLECTUAL OR THE LEADER OF THE BIG CORPORATION OR THE TYPE A PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THINGS. THE STEREOTYPES PORTRAYED IN FILM AND TELEVISION NEEDS CHANGE. WELL THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY ANSWER TO CHANGING OUR PLACE IN AMERICA. CHANGE IN WHAT PEOPLE SEE ON TELEVISION AND IN FILM WILL HELP WITH REAL WORLD CHANGE. FOR ME PERSONALLY OF COURSE THERE ARE THE MICRO AGGRESSIONS I DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY. PEOPLE ASKING ME TO TRANSLATE FOR THEIR MEXICAN NANNY. FOR THEIR GARDENER OR COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR HOUSEKEEPER OR JOKES ABOUT. IMMIGRANTS OR A BEGINNER. BUT THERE'S ALSO TIMES WHEN PEOPLE STEP UP ON A RECENT SET ONE OF THE CREW WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE NOISE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SITE NEXT DOOR AND SAID ONE WE JUST CALL IMMIGRATION. TELL SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THAT INSTANCE THE DIRECTOR AND MYSELF WE BOTH SPOKE UP AND SHOT THAT COMMENT RIGHT DOWN. THE APPROPRIATENESS WAS ADDRESSED IN THAT MOMENT. WELL MY YEARS IN INDUSTRY HAVE LED ME TO BELIEVE IS THAT THE PROBLEM OF DIVERSITY IN HOLLYWOOD IS NOT SIX AND WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY PUSH TO GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE MY INDUSTRY REFLECTS THE LARGER PROBLEM WE FACE IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY. IN FACT WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW IS THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS DEBATE THE NEED FOR CHANGE. IN BLACK AND WHITE. PEOPLE NEED TO OPEN THEIR EYES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT THE NUANCED OF DIVERSITY IS GETTING LOST. WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE COME IN A RAINBOW OF COLORS. WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT DIVERSITY CAN BE APPLIED TO AGE DISABILITY GENDER. AND SEXUAL PREFERENCE AS WELL. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS WHO SOMEONE IS. AND WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO ASKED ME TO HIRE SOMEONE SAY WELL THAT PERSON'S NOT DIVERSE ENOUGH OR WE WANT A CERTAIN TYPE OF PERSON. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE I ANY IDEA. THAT DIVERSITY MIGHT BE RIGHT THERE LOOKING AT THEM IN THE FACE. LATINAS OFTEN GET HURT BY THIS LIMITED ATTITUDE OFTEN FROM EXECUTIVE SUITES I KNOW THIS. SEEN AS REPRESENTING DIVERSITY AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL OR FOR THE CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WHAT KIND OF WORLD VIEW CREATE DISK THAT KIND OF WORLD VIEW CREATE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OR ANGRY WITH EACH OTHER. THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO PIT PEOPLE AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GO. WE NEED TO RESPECT AND EMBRACE THE NEW PEOPLE WE MUST GET INTO THIS INDUSTRY. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE. WE SET OUR SIGHTS ON INCLUSION BOTH ON THE SET BUT ALSO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO GREEN LIGHT. WHAT KIND OF SHOWS WE SEE AND WHO GETS HIRED. THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT IS VERY MUCH BUILT ON TRUST. TO GET YOUNG LATINAS INTO THIS INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE THAN PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF OFFERING THEM BY HAND. WE NEED AND WANT EVERYONE TO DO IT. AND I BELIEVE THAT MEANS WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES EVERYONE'S INTEREST SOMETHING TO BE EMBRACED AND NOT RUN FROM. THE CHALLENGE OF CHANGES TO MAKE EVERYONE BELIEVE IN ITS NECESSITY AND GREATER THAT. I WORK IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE CHANGE HAPPENS EVERY DAY ON THE SET AND I DO BELIEVE WE CAN GET THERE. THANK YOU GUYS I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHILE I'M WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA PAUSE BEFORE THE NEXT PANEL THAT WAS FABULOUS AND I'M SURE SOME OF THE EVERYBODY HAS SOME QUESTIONS ALL START WITH ONE AND THEN- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND ASK. THE OTHER MEMBERS. WHAT QUESTIONS OF ANY THEY HAVE- I WAS STRUCK WHEN- PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THEY'VE DEVELOPED TO HELP WITH DIVERSITY. BUT IN A KIND OF BROADER SENSE CAN YOU. ADDRESS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS THAT STUDIOS HAVE. OR ARE THEY WORKING WHY OR WHY NOT WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THEM IT SEEMS IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. THAT THE- ARE CLEAR TO ME THAT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN WERE WERE THINGS THAT YOU ALL DID YOURSELVES TO HELP LEND A HAND OR OR A TO BROUGHT IN- THAT THE NETWORK BUT- WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS IF ANY ON THE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AT THE STUDIOS HAVE. ANY OF. I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO MY EXPERIENCE I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AGENCY FELLOWSHIP BUT ALSO TO DO N. B. C.'S WRITERS ON THE VERGE WHICH IS A IN STUDIO- STUDIO INITIATIVE AT NBC AND I THINK THEY'RE FANTASTIC BUT THEIR NUMBERS OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE GETTING TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND APPLICANTS EACH YEAR AND GREW THEIR FORTUNATE IF THEY HAVE ONE LEFT IN- IN THAT IN EACH CLASS EACH YEAR. AND IT'S- I AM AND I KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THAT THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THESE INITIATIVES. WITHIN THE STUDIO SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE GREAT TO GET YOU IN THE DOOR BUT THEN THEY DO NOT HELP YOU TO GET THE SECOND JOB. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING IN OUR OF NETWORKING GROUP THAT 30% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE OUR- STAFF WRITER LEVEL. IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET HIRED AS STORY EDITORS WHICH IS THE SECOND TIER UP. WHICH IS LITERALLY DOUBLE THE PAY SO IF THEY CAN COME FOR FREE OR CHEAP THEIR STUDIO SYSTEM THEN THEY'RE GETTING WORK BUT THEN WHEN. IT REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOU KNOW COME OUT OF A TRUE BUDGET. THERE THE- THE STEP UP FOR THAT DIVERSITY IS TO STOP THEIR WE'RE NOT SEEING IT TO THE SAME EXTENT- I KNOW I HAVE I YOU KNOW I HAVE CONTACTS AT THESE. DIFFERENT EQUITY YOU KNOW. EXECUTIVES I KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM IT'S NOT THE WORKING TOWARDS. BUT IT'S STILL AN ISSUE. THANK YOUNG. CAME THROUGH- A DIFFERENT ASPECT I GUESS IT WAS A DIVERSITY HIRE- AND HISTORICALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE. I MET HAD TO REPEAT BECAUSE I'M AS- THESE DIVERSITY HIRES THEY THEY HIRE YOU FOR LIKE THE TWENTY BASIC WEEKS. AND THEN.

I ALSO WANT TO I'M AT THOMAS NEAR AYE AYE AYE TO IMPORT AGAIN SO CONTENT TO TALK FAST AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE AND BRING UP HENRY DORROUGH WHO PASSED AWAY- IN MARCH AND WAS REALLY A TRAILBLAZER IN THE INDUSTRY HELPING TO FOUND THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD- ETHNIC COMMITTEE- AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION HAD HIM BUT I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES. ON MY DISTRICT THE SENATE CREDO GROWING PRODUCTION INDUSTRY- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FRONT OF THIS DILEMMA WE'RE FACING WHICH IS THE WORK FORCE AND. ACCESS TO S. N. AND- I PROVIDING US. WORK AND- OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE SEEN THIS PUSH FOR STEAM EDUCATION NOT JUST STEM. BUT SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY. ENGINEERING ARTS AND MUSIC HOW CAN WE- SUPPORT THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. TO REALLY BE EQUIPPED WITH THE SKILLS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE INDUSTRY. AND HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE INDUSTRY WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL. OTHER YOUNG LATINO WOMEN WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE IN THIS INDUSTRY WHETHER IT'S WRITING. WHETHER IT'S A SET BUILDING PAINTING SEAMSTRESS- BEING A- A CATERER YOU KNOW WHAT CAN THEY DO NOW. AND HOW CAN WE BE SUPPORTIVE. THANKS I MEAN I THINK- OH SORRY I JUST WANTED TO I JUST WANT TO CHIME IN AND THEN- EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PANEL TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES BUT I JUST WANTED TO PLUG- BUT YOU SONORA PROJECT WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND- IT'S- BEING IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ACTUALLY BUT- WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IT'S RUN BY THE LATINO FILM INSTITUTE AND IT'S- IS PART OF THE CURRICULUM. THAT IS- FOR- FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADERS AND THEN SOME STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO WHAT- WHAT IT IS THAT THAT THE STUDENTS ARE TRAINED- FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO THE END OF THE YEAR TO CREATE THEIR OWN TOWN SO THEY BECOME FILMMAKERS AND- WHAT IT HAS HELPED IS- JUST REALLY HELP WITH THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS AND- JUST MADE THEM MORE CONFIDENCE BUT ALSO WHAT THE- YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS IT'S OPENED THEIR EYES TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND ZERO BY THE TIME THAT THEY ARE DONE WITH ON THE PROGRAM THEY CREATED A SHORT FILM THAT THEY END UP SHOWING AT THE LATINO FILM INSTITUTES- FESTIVAL LET LEAVE AND SO IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT HELPS THEM- JUST WITH THEIR YOU KNOW SELF ESTEEM AND TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL BUT THEN ALSO- IT JUST SHOWS THEM THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE BECOMING A FILMMAKER IS NOT SOME ABSTRACT IDEA AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF THEIR REACH AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO PLUG THAT THAT- PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW THAT PROGRAM- COULD BE AT EVERY SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA IT JUST. NEEDS MORE FUNDING. THANKS THANKS A TERRY WAS GOING. JUMP INTO. YES I ACTUALLY GOING TO ECHO- THE SAME IDEA- IN IN EDUCATION AND- ARTS BASED EDUCATION AND INTRODUCING KIDS AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL OF MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL HAT THESE KINDS OF JOBS EXIST AND- I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS REALLY REALLY YOUNG AND REALLY EARLY AND GOT A HAND OUT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A BUSINESS WHERE. YOU DON'T HEY WHERE CAN I PUT MY APPLICATION IS SOMEONE REALLY HAS YOU HAVE TO BE INVITED YOU KNOW ONE- THERE'S NO PLACE TO SIGN UP FOR IT SOMEBODY HAS TO BRING YOU IN AND SOMEBODY BROUGHT ME IN. AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO TO MENTOR SHIPS- OPEN PANDEMIC I WAS INVITED TO A NEW YORK CITY BASED TASK FORCE WHERE I'M INSURED- A WOMAN AND I MENTOR IT SOMEONE HERE IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL TO. TRYING TO GET INTO MY INDUSTRY WHAT WOULD STEPS I TOOK- AND I THINK THAT. MENTORSHIPS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE COULD PUT THAT. CONNECTION WITH IT'S COMING OUT OF COLLEGE OR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO MAYBE WANT TO WORK BELOW THE LINE OR ABOUT THE LINE- TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THESE JOBS EVEN EXIST YOU KNOW I NEVER I GREW UP IN LA AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW MY JOB EXISTED. AND AND THE THIRD THE GOOD PAYING JOBS THE UNION JOBS ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND WE NEED TO LET WE NEED TO BRIDGE THAT. IN IN EDUCATION. AND THE WORKPLACE SO WHETHER THAT'S WITH MENTORSHIPS INTERNSHIPS- YOU KNOW MAKING OUR PRESENCE KNOWN AND YOU KNOW AND THE ARTS OF REALLY SEPARATE OVER THE YEARS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND I THINK IT'S BEGINS THERE WE REALLY NEED TO GET BACK TO. ARTS BASED CURRICULUMS. I FEEL REALLY STRONGLY THAT. THAT IS PROBABLY OUR WEAKEST LINK IS OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION- HAS CUT ALL THE ARTS. AND FUNDING FOR THE ARTS. SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START THAT'S A GREAT DIRECTIVE PRESS PRESSURE AT WENDY DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION I THANK YOU- I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THE EXPERIENCES OF GETTING INTO THE WRITERS ROOM SO YOU KNOW IT IT'S- THE CHALLENGE RIGHT TO EVEN BECOME THIS THE STEPS THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE TO EVEN BECOME A SHOW RUNNER. BEGINS TO EVEN GETTING ACCESS TO THE INTERNSHIP TO GET INTO THE WRITERS ROOM CAN YOU SHARE SOME OF THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES WHAT YOU SEEN WITH THOSE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN I MANY MANY MOONS AGO IN A PAST LIFE- WAS IN A WRITERS ROOM AND I JUST FOUND THAT THE- THE BROMANCE AND THE- YOU KNOW THOSE. IT'S JUST IT'S VERY HARD FOR WOMEN AND VERY HARD FOR SPECIFICALLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET INTO THOSE ROOMS. WHERE- OTHER- WRITERS ARE CREATING AND MAKING DECISIONS ON WHAT THE STORIES ARE LATINOS AND LATINAS SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND I'M I AM CURIOUS WHAT THE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN. FOUR PANELISTS. WELL I'M SURE IT WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING- I. JUST FROM IT'S A PRETTY BECAUSE NOW THERE'S MORE OF US LIKE TO LINA SAID RIGHT LIKE THERE'S- MORE OF A STRETCH. THE THERE'S THE OPTION OF RESENTMENT THAT I KEEP HEARING ESPECIALLY FROM STRAIGHT A'S STRAIGHT CIS WHITE MALES ARE LIKE SLOW THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR JOBS IT IS SO PRESENT IT IS AND YOU KNOW WHO'S PERPETUATING THE ABOUT THE AGENTS THERE LIKE ARE YOU CAN GET THAT JOB IS IT WHEN DIVERSE WHICH I HATE THE TERM DIVERSITY HIGHER IT'S- IT'S UNDER BROWN USED TERM YOU CAN HAVE ONE THING TO BE DIVERSE RIGHT BUT LIKE IT'S COLD BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THE MAN OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW. BUT BUT I DO FEEL LIKE WE ARE ENTERING BUT THEN WE ARE MET WITH A LOT OF ROOM. LIKE MY AGGRESSIONS BUT EVEN TO ENTER BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION RIGHT. IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE LIKE I CAN APPLY FOR THE JOB SITUATION YOU HAVE TO. HAVE CAUGHT FIRE SOMEHOW SO WHAT I NEED LIKE SO EITHER YOU'RE A PILOT YOU WROTE OR- OF WEB SERIES YOU'RE YOU YOU CREATED OR A PLATE THAT WHICH WAS HOW I ENTERED. CATCHES FIRE. AND THEN SOME EVEN IF YOU'RE AND YOU MIGHT BE ASSISTING YOU EVERY AND THEN YOU MIGHT GET A MANAGER YOU MIGHT GET. AN AGENT THE TEN CENTS TO SUBMIT YOU FOR JOBS I MEAN THE STEPS TO GET. INTO A WRITER FROM ARE SO MANY YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO GET REPRESENTATION YOU CAN'T JUST- GET INTERVIEW OR WHATEVER FOR IT FOR A FOR OUR WRITERS ROOM POSITION. WITHOUT REPRESENTATION AND THEN AND THEN YOU'RE COMPETING YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN YOU GET IN LIKE WE TOLD YOU LIKE- SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LET YOU REPEAT ITSELF SO IT'S- I'M A LITTLE. I'M SURE YOU- HAVE MORE INSIGHT ON THAT I'VE BEEN I'VE SAT OUT THE- COULD NOT NOT LIKE I'M JUST WRITING- PILOTS AND I KNOW THAT NOW THERE'S LIKE. SHORTER ROOMS SO LIKE- TITLES AND LEVELS ARE NOT- AS RHYS. BACK DID YOU DO IT LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO REPEAT THEM BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO. ENTER I- TO GET IN BUT I DO HAVE TO SEE THE TALENT IS OUT THERE NOT JUST. FROM OUR BRANCH GROUP I LIKE I HAVE FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT WE- THE LET ME HIGHER LET THE NEXT SECULAR FOR MY COMPANY- HIGHLINE. AND SHE READS LIKE FIVE SCRIPTS A DAY AND WE ARE OUT THERE LIKE THE TALENT IS OUT THERE IT'S JUST. A MATTER OF. GETTING IN AND GETTING THAT SUPPORT- YEAH AND- TO CARRY THAT FORWARD. BUT WHENEVER I MEET WITH THE SPY RING WRITERS UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO THIS IT'S NOT THERE'S A TRACK THAT I CAN SAY DO A. B. C. D. AND E. AND THEN YOU WILL BECOME A WRITER BECAUSE THAT IS EVERY PERSON'S PATH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND OFTENTIMES BERRY ARBITRARY AND HAS SO MUCH TO DO WITH A LOT- AND THERE ARE PLACES WHERE I REFER PEOPLE LIKE YOU KNOW I OFTENTIMES TELL SPARRING WRITERS LIKE GO TO ANYTIME SEIZE WEBSITE SUBMIT TO THEIR- TV WRITING FELLOWSHIP THAT'S- SUCH A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO. BEGIN NETWORKING IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE CONTACTS- THE TELEVISION ACADEMY GOING ACTIVE WITH THEY ALSO HAVE A GREAT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STUDENTS APPLY THEIR PEOPLE WHO ARE SPIERINGS- BUT SO MUCH OF THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO BREAK INTO THIS INDUSTRY IS WORK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. ALONE IN YOUR ROOM AND THAT IS OFTENTIMES THE STRUGGLE OF THE WRITER IS SITTING IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER BEING LIKE I'M GOING TO WRITE THE SCRIPT AND PRAY AND HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT IT WILL GET INTO THE HANDS OF CIRCLING THROUGH CONTACTS AND GET A CREATE WHETHER THAT'S ON THE ON TWITTER OR BY CREATING CONTENT ON TICK TOCK OR BY LAUNCHING MY WEB SERIES ON YOUTUBE- AND SO I JUST. REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUNGER GENERATIONS TO CREATE AND TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND TO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO A WRITERS ROOM ASK EVERYONE AROUND YOU DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS ON A SAT DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE DISTANTLY CONNECTED TO A WRITER CAN I HAVE A COFFEE WITH YOU CAN I GET CAN I. GET YOU KNOW PICK YOUR BRAIN CAN I GET GUIDANCE AND INFORMATION BECAUSE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESS IN OUR INDUSTRY I THINK THAT'S WHAT ON THE AND I AND OTHER LATINOS HAVE CREATED THESE GROUPS FOR OURSELVES IS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF LOS ALL LOCKING. ARMS AND HELPING TO DRAG EACH OTHER UP. PAN WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION I KNOW- MONEY LANA HAD A- QUESTION. IN THE CHAT MEDINA. OKAY THANK YOU CHAIR- I WAS CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT THE SPANISH LANGUAGE NETWORKS. AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. HOW IS-THAT CONNECTED- WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. ALL THE FROM THE EXECUTIVES EVERYTHING IN THAT WORLD TO OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ARE THERE DIRECT CONNECTIONS OR IS IT LIKE TO DUMP CLEARLY DIFFERENT WORLDS ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES OR NOT. THERE THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT BECAUSE- THAT A LOT OF THOSE PRODUCTIONS ARE SOURCED IN THE MAKING GO THIS WAY LYING COLUMBIA AND SO AND THEN THEY'RE IMPORTED- SO THERE'S A LOT OF THEM DON'T I MEAN IT THE ACTORS DO WORK HERE AND THE MAKE OF IT IT'S A DIFFERENT IT'S A DIFFERENT LANE. NO WAY- AND. A VERY VERY LIKE SUPPORTED AND WATCHED BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LET LET THEME THERE WERE AFTER LIKE A NON SPANISH SPEAKERS SOMETIME I MEAN NOT REALLY I'M AFTER EVERY LETTING OUR YOU KNOW BUT- YOU KNOW I'M NOT BOTHERED WHEN YOU SEE ON AND SHE WILL NEVER WTCH MY SHOW I MEAN SHE SHOULD NEVR WATCH MYSELF BECAUSE SHOULD BE LIKE. NIEMIEC GAS IS. SO BUT BUT BUT IT IT- WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE UP SPACE AS AMERICAN AT THE MISS YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE. BECAUSE THAT IT'S A IT'S A LINK TO LATIN AMERICA AND IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND THAT THAT'S ALSO HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY WAY TO RELEGATE US AND SORT OF DISMISS US. OPPOSITE THEY HAVE A NEW REASON THEY HAVE THE LIMóN THAT YOU KNOW. AND THE PRODUCTION SO THAT THEY DON'T GET PAID SOMETIMES ARE NINE UNION LIKE IT'S A WHOLE MESS OVER THERE. WE WANT TO TAKE UP SPACE LIKE AMERICANS EVEN THOUGH I'M- NOT AMERICAN I'M STILL HAVE A GREEN CARD. I WOULD MAKE. BUT GET RIGHT BECAUSE I'M MEXICAN RIGHT WE'RE ALL AMERICANS BUT LIKE I WANT WE WANT TO TAKE A SPACE LIKE THAT AND THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE TEMPERATURES UNION SHOWS AND MOSTLY IN ENGLISH ALTHOUGH NOW IT'S KEEPS GETTING MESSIER INTERNATIONAL BUT BUT ANYWAY I LET YOU LET ME KNOW- SIX. I'VE BEEN SAYING REALLY INTERESTING THING WHERE- COMPANIES THAT ARE BASED LIKE IN MEXICO ARE ASKING FOR. YOU KNOW LIKE LATINO WRITERS IN THE STATES AND THERE'S A- YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SPEAK SPANISH WE JUST WANT YOU TO WRITE AND THEN WILL TRANSLATE IT AND THEN WE'LL SHIP IT BACK TO THE STATES. SO THERE HAS BEEN A REALLY INTERESTING BACK AND FORTH IT'S HAPPENING BUT THAT'S THAT'S A VERY MUCH BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE THE STREAMERS. BECAUSE OF THE GREAT OUT CONTENT THAT'S BEING CREATED INTERNATIONALLY THAT YOU'RE SEEING ON PLACES LIKE NETFLIX- SO THERE'S A KIND OF BLURRING OF THE LINES- WHICH IS. FANTASTIC BECAUSE HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALLOW YOU KNOW WRITERS WHO ARE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHO HAVE THOSE CREDITS TO BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER. AND TO MOVE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO SPACES. AND ALSO THAT THE CONCERN IS WITH- WITH STREAMERS IS THAT THE- INTERNAL YOU KNOW HAVING INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING LIKE EVERYONE SAID IS GREAT BUT THEN THEY JUST SAY WELL WE HAVE WE HAVE THE DIVERSITY HERE SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE- PEOPLE FROM SPAIN AND SO YOU KNOW IN OUR STUDY WE DON'T- CONSIDER PEOPLE FROM SPAIN AS LATINOS BECAUSE THAT'S THAT DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION RIGHT SO THERE. SO WE'RE NOT IN OUR CITY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HISPANIC SO WE ARE SPECIFIC TO THE TALKING ABOUT LATIN ACTS REPRESENTATION AND SO THAT YOU KNOW THE CONCERN IS THAT- THE COMPANIES CAN SAY THIS YEAR'S GONNA SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS A SPANISH. SPEAKING CONTENT OF SPANISH LANGUAGE CONTENT YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOULD SATISFY YOU BUT LIKE WHAT- I YOU KNOW EVERYONE ON THE PANEL SAYING IS TAT WE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE HERE AS U. S. LEVINE ALSO RIGHT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BORN HERE TO BE CONSIDERED A U. S. LATINO OR LATIN NEXT- PERSON YOU JUST HAVE TO BE LIVING HERE AND SO- WE WANT THOSE STORIES TO BE TOLD WE WANT. TO HAVE THOSE SHOWS THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE. OF LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU THAT THIS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC- I I'M GONNA MAKE AN ADMISSION RIGHT HERE AND MY DAUGHTER OKAY KILL ME BUT THIS THIS- THIS P. SEVENTEEN LATINAS WAS NOT MY IDEA IT WAS IT WAS WENDY CARILLO WAS IDEA- BECAUSE I I'M A FORMER UNION ORGANIZER I WAS REALLY FOCUSED THE AND A LAWYER SO I'M I'M FOCUSING ON. YOU KNOW LOW WAGE JOBS AND LETTING US INTO LAW IT WHEN HE'S LIKE OH WE HAVE TO DO HOLLYWOOD AND WE DID AND I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY SO MY DAUGHTER WHO I LOVE IS IT YOU KNOW AT A PA IT AT- NETFLIX AND SO SHE'S ACTUALLY WATCHING SHE'S LIKE THIS IS YOUR BEST ONE YET SO. I'M YOU GUYS SHE SHE ACTUALLY YOU APPRECIATE THIS I IF YOU IF I DIDN'T HEAR PRECISELY AS SHE GOES I FEEL A LITTLE LESS CRAZY NOW SO- YOU PROVIDED THAT FOUR ONE LET ME KNOW WHO'S TRYING TO GET IN THE INDUSTRY SO IT'S WELL KNOW THAT. I THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH IF YOU WANT TO STAY ON WE'RE GOING TO GO TO PANEL TO.

HELLO HI WELL HEAR ME YES ALL RIGHT GREAT THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS PANEL I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE FILM COMMISSION AND TELL YOU ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER. THE FOUNDATION ENHANCES CALIFORNIA'S STATUS AS A LEADER IN THE MOTION PICTURE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY IT SUPPORTS PROJECTS OF ALL SIZES AND BUDGETS AND FOCUSES ON ACTIVITIES THAT STIMULATE AND PRESERVE PRODUCTION JOBS SPENDING TAX REVENUES IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM'S MISSION IS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. Y CREATING JOBS THROUGH THE ALLOCATION OF TAX CREDITS FOR PROJECTS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE LEAVE THE STATE. TAX CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED MAINLY FOR THE LOW THE LINE JOBS BASICALLY JOBS- NOT ABOVE THE LINE JOBS. THE ORIGINAL TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. FIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A PROGRAM TO PLANO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND PROGRAM THREE POINT ALLEN TWENTY NINETEEN. AS OF MARCH OF THIS YEAR THE CSE HAS ALLOCATED A TOTAL OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS. TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PROJECTS WHICH ARE ON TRACK TO SPEND ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE. I DON'T FLY A HUNDRED AND. FORTY SIX THOUSAND CAST AND CREW.

TAX CREDIT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS TWO POINT NO HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE. INTERNS PAID INTERNS TOTALING THIRTY THOUSAND INTERNSHIP HOURS IN ADDITION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT STUDENTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PROFESSIONAL SKILLS CHORES. WELL THIRTY SIX FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN EXTERNSHIPS AND IN CLASSROOM WORKSHOPS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING STATEWIDE WITH HIGH SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CAREER BASED LEARNING PROGRAMS WITH A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS TO EXPOSE THEM TO THE DIFFERENT JOBS. THAT EXIST IN THE FILM BUSINESS. AND I WAS HAVING SHOW YOU SLICE DAY QUITE WORK OUT BUT WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE SLIDESHOW WERE PHOTOS OF SOME OF THESE PARTICIPANTS WE HAD STUDENTS FROM CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL WHO I WORK WITH DIRECTOR AVA DUVERNAY WHILE SHE WAS FILMINGA WRINKLE IN TIME THERE.

WERE IN THIS BUSINESS. ALL RIGHT POINT OH NOW INCLUDE A MORE FIVE TRAINING PRO FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THESE INDIVIDUALS WORK WITH OUR TRAINING PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO COMPETE AND THRIVE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. SO FAR WE'VE HAD FORTY ONE PROJECTS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THIS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM'S FIRST PHASE INCLUDES TEACHING LIFE SKILLS FOLLOWED BY TECHNICAL TRAINING FOR CAREERS IN THE INDUSTRY. PARTICIPANTS ARE THEN MATCHED WITH MENTORS IN THEIR FIELD AND THIS KIND OF SPEAKS TO WHAT I HEARD EARLIER A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE KIND OF GETTING OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THEY'RE KIND OF. THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S THERE TO SUPPORT THEM ALONG THE WAY AND THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE MENTORS IN THE FIELD THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE INTERESTED IN SO THEY CAN HELP AND SUPPORT THEM PROVIDE CONNECTIONS TO HELP THEM REALLY GET. GOOD JOBS AND START A CAREER IN THE INDUSTRY. ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR LIFE SKILLS EDUCATION. TRAINING AND THEY WORK ON SOME PROJECTS. PAGE SOME PROJECTS THEY WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE.

GUINNESS JULIANA AND YOU SELL AND THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES ALL OF THEM EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO BREAK INTO FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND ALTHOUGH THEY ALL HAVE PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WORKING LOW PAYING. NINE UNIONS THOUGH JOBS OR ANY TYPE OF JOB THEY COULD FIND TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES.

AND GIULIANA REVEALED THAT ONE OF THE THINGS SHE LEARNED WAS TO BE PERSISTENT BUT NOT ANNOYING WHICH IS IMPORTANT TOOLS. BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WORK. SO THAT'S HOW IS.

MY NAME IS ARGHA MEDINA AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION AND OUR MEMBER COMPANIES. MPA'S COMMITTED TO ENCOURAGING GREAT STORYTELLING THE REFLECTS THE VIEWPOINTS AND EXPERIENCES OF ALL CREATORS AND AUDIENCES WHICH IS WHY WE ARE WORKING HARD WITH OUR MEMBER STUDIOS TO ADDRESS DIVERSITY GENDER PARITY AUTHENTIC CULTURE REPRESENTATION. PIPELINE OR CRIMINAL RETURNEES FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE. BY PUBLISHING PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE A DIVERSE TALENT PIPELINE. AND CREATING PARTNERSHIPS AND SHARING WHAT WE LEARN WE ARE LEADING BY EXAMPLE. ONE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE GET THE M. P. PLAYING IS INSURING THAT YOU'RE SHOWING THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA TO DEMONSTRATE. THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSE AUDIENCES TO THE ECONOMICS OF THE INDUSTRY. PART OF OUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THAT THE HER PARK. OUR ANNUAL ANALYSIS AND SURVEY OF THE THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT. ONE NOTABLE TAKE AWAY FROM RECENT RECORDS THAT THE AUDIENCES ARE AMONG ONE OF THE NATION'S BIGGEST MOVIE THAT. ACCOUNTING FOR OUTSIDE SHARE THE BOX OFFICE RUN. RELATIVE TO THEIR PORTION OF THE POPULATION. THIS DATA HELPS. TO THE BUSINESS CASE FOR STRONGER DIVERSITY EFFORTS AND RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS FOR MOVIE SUCH AS BLACK PANTHER SPIDER MAN INTO THE SPIDER VERSE. COCOA CRAZY RICH ASIANS AND THE FAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE AND NOT TO MENTION LAST YEAR'S BEST PICTURE MINOR PARASITE. BROTHER VALIDATING THE BUSINESS CASE FOR DIVERSITY RIGHT TELLING. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. WHAT'S MORE IS NINE YEARS AGO THE MPA ESTABLISHED OUR OWN DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION PROGRAM THREE YEARS BEFORE. RIGHT FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE JOINT HEADS UP BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS PROPERLY SUPPORTED THE MPA CLAIMED A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN FORGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK TO DIVERSIFY THE CREATIVE PIPELINE IN OUR INSURANCE DEPARTMENT CONSTITUENCIES STUDIOS POLICYMAKERS MULTICULTURAL CRATER INNOVATIONS CAN'T COMMUNICATE COLLABORATE SHARPLES.

YES HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT AND WRITERS ROOM BY THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO SEASON 25% OF THE SCRIPTED ELEMENT BUDGET WILL BE ALLOCATED TO DIVERSE CREATORS. AND 40% OF THE WRITERS WILL BE pFUND FOR CREATIVE EQUITY TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF OUR PRESENT UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. THEY WILL INVEST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND A COMBINATION OF EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH STRONG TRACK RECORDS. OF STANDING UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AFTER SUCCESS IN TV AND FILMS AS WELL AS BESPOKE NETWORK PROGRAMS. THAT WILL HELP IDENTIFY AND TRAIN AND PROVIDE JOB PLACEMENT FOR UP AND COMING TALENT GLOBALLY. ATTENTION WILL BE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN LGBTQ. PLUS COMMUNITY AND DIFFERENTLY ABLED PEOPLE. PROMISE ME DAD BUT SOME PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN A MULTI.

FOUNDED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE HATE DISCRIMINATION AND RACISM TOWARDS THE LATINO COMMUNITY WE EDUCATE AND INCREASED VISIBILITY OF LATINOS FROM OUR POLICY WORK IN WASHINGTON DC TO OUR MEDIA ADVOCACY WORK IN HOLLYWOOD. WHERE WE COLLABORATE CREATE AND CONNECT LATTER NEXT TALENT WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS AND I HEARD SOMEBODY EARLIER TALK ABOUT CONGRESSMAN. JOAQUIN CASTRO WHO HAS LED THE FIGHT. AT ANYTIME SEE WE FOCUS ON ALL FORMS OF MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS THAT AFFECTS. ATTITUDES VALUES AND BELIEFS OF SOCIETY HOW LEAD TO NEXT ARE REPRESENTED IS HOW WE ARE TREATED IN REAL LIFE AND WE ARE NOT TREATED VERY WELL. YOU CAN DRAW A LINE FROM THE PERVASIVE LACK OF POSITIVE LATINO REPRESENTATION ON THE SCREEN TO THE RISE OF HATE CRIMES AGAINST OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE MASSACRE THAT TOOK PLACE IN AND ALSO THE HOUSE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THERE IS A DANGEROUS CONNECTION BETWEEN RACIST RHETORIC AND THE NEGATIVE IMAGES OF LATINOS AS CRIMINALS AND INVADERS THAT AMERICANS SEE ON THE SCREEN. WHEN TRUMP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SAID THAT MEXICANS WERE CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS HATE CRIME WENT UP AND THAT'S JUST NOT ME THAT SAYING THIS THESE ARE FBI REPORTS. SOMETIMES WERE NOT REPRESENTED AT ALL WE ARE EXCLUDED. THERE ARE SOME SHOWS RIGHT NOW ON THE AIR. WHETHER IT'S TELEVISION OR STREAMING THERE ARE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ARE MORE THAN ONE RECURRING LATIN NEXT CHARACTER OR NOT ONE LATIN NEXT WRITER IN THE ROOM. WHEN OUR CHILDREN DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES UP ON THE BIG SCREEN OR IF THEY DON'T SEE IT OR IF THEY ONLY SEE THEMSELVES IN NEGATIVE ROLES IMAGINE WHAT THAT DOES TO. A CHILD'S PSYCHE. IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH IN THIS ROOM THIS IS WHAT HURT ME THE MOST IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH FOR OUR CHILDREN TO SEE THEMSELVES ON THE BIG SCREEN. SO THEY CAN BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. BECAUSE IF YOU SEE IT YOU CAN BE AT. SO THIS IS WHY NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO AN AGENCY. CREATED EDUCATIONAL AND WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. LIKE THE SERIES SCRIPT WRITERS PROGRAM AND THE LATIN EXTREME SHOWCASE THEY CREATES COLLABORATES IT CONNECTS THE LATIN NEXT TALENT WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. WE HAVE HAD MANY LATINOS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH OUR PROGRAM WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR PROGRAM. AND IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL C. AT OUR NELLIS. WHO IS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND HER SHOWED HER SERIES JUST STARTED RUTHERFORD FALLS SILVIO LEVI S. WHOSE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF A LINE UP ABA LORD NOW SHE'S WITH NETFLIX. AND YOU READY HEARD TODAY FROM TWO TO LENA SHE'S ARE ALLOWED. ZAIDA ED WROTE FOR THE ONE NOT AND SELENA THE CERES HIRED. TWO OF OUR FEMALE WRITERS JESSICA LOPEZ OF PAMELA GARCIA RUNNING. BUT IF I CAN JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THIS BECAUSE IN HANDY IN ORDER FOR LATINOS TO BE FULLY REPRESENTED IN MEDIA WE NEED TO GET US AT THE MOST HIGHEST LEVEL OF INFLUENCE AND POWER LIKE THE BOARD ROOM. PRESIDENT AND CEO POSITIONS AND MEDIAL OWNERSHIP. MOST OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA WERE MORE THAN 40% OF THE POPULATION AND A LOT OF THEM ARE LOCATED RIGHT HERE IN ALLEN COUNTY WHERE WE ARE MORE THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN CALIFORNIA THE TALKED ABOUT CORPORATIONS HAVING. UNDER A ONE UNDER REPRESENTATIVE BOARD OF DIRECTOR. ON THEIR BOARDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SINCE THAT BILL PASSED WOMEN HAVE INCREASETHE NUMBER WOMEN HAVE INCREASED 40% BUT LATINOS ARE ONLY 3% SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND ALWAYS ON THE WORDS THAT WERE USING ONLY USE DIVERSE CITY INCLUSION UNDER REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE MANY TIMES WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LETTING US AND WE ARE WOMEN. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU AND WHAT A PERFECT SEGUE- ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THIS COMMITTEE IS BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR CHANGE TO HAPPEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT LATINOS- WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF DIVERSITY INITIATIVES THAT I THINK IS THE FIRST PANEL SAID. LATINAS AREN'T SEEN AS DIVERSE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE PASSED RULES ABOUT DIVERSITY ON BOARDS- IT STILL HAS NOT THAT LATINOS ARE THE MOST UNDER REPRESENTED EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WOMEN ON BOARDS. OR ON. FULL OF COLOR ON BOARD SO WHERE IT. WE GOT A FIGHT- FOR THAT INTENTIONALITY- JUST JUST TO TRY TO BECOME MORE REPRESENTATIVE. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ARLEN AND IT PRETTY MUCH HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE ENDED THAT. SO MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION IS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON- IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA PRODUCTION.THOSE JOBS OFTEN INVOLVE SKILLED CRAFTSPEOPLE SPECIAL TRADES BUT THERE'S SO MANY JOBS WITHIN THE STUDIOS IN THE OFFICES THAT ARE ENTRY LEVEL JOBS WHERE SOMEONE COULD LEARN IN ADVANCE. WHAT ARE THE STUDIOS DOING TO GET LEVINE AS INTO THE FRONT OFFICE JOBS. I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU ASPECTS I THINK I'M LOOKING AT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY MOST PEOPLE THINK. YOU KNOW WRITERS PRODUCERS DIRECTORS ACTORS AND THE ENERGY MINISTRY HAS- ECOSYSTEM RIGHT THERE'S LAWYERS ACCOUNTANTS THERE'S TRASH THERE'S THAT MEDICS THERE'S- ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT- JOBS AND- EACH OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS HAVE NUMEROUS INTERNSHIPS FELLOWSHIPS- AND PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW. FOLKS TO COME IN ON THE CORPORATE LEVEL EXECUTIVE LEVEL- AND SO I'M- HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT WHAT SIX MEMBER COMPANIES. LIMIT ABOUT TIME- I CAN'T LIST THEM ALL BUT I DO KNOW THAT ALL THE FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE. YES PROGRAMS TO. HAVE PEOPLE COME INTO THE PIPELINE AND I'M HAPPY TO SET A TIME WITH YOU ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WHAT THE WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE. WE WOULD LOVE TO GET PRO I THINK DETAILED- ACCOUNTING OF THE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING. TOWARDS THE FUTURE OF ANY KIND OF- FUTURE TAX CREDIT THAT THAT WE'RE DESIGNING HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THE DIVERSITY ASPECT IS ONE WE NEED TO REALLY DRILL DOWN ON SO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. REMOVE ON SAYS THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION. YES THANK YOU. I'M SO A USC STUDY FOUND THAT FILMS WITH UNDER REPRESENTED LEEDS AND COLLEAGUES RECEIVE LESS RESOURCES THAN FILMS WITH WHITE LEADS. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS IS THERE ANY BACKGROUND YOU CAN PROVIDE AS TO HOW. PRODUCTION BUDGETS ARE ALLOCATED TO FILM CENTERED AROUND UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS LATINOS AND LATINAS. AND CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW PROJECTS ARE GREEN LIGHTED AND BUDGETS. ARE APPROVED AND LASTLY WHAT CAN WE DO. BEYOND THE TAX CREDIT THAT WILL HELP US RETAIN MORE OF OUR INDUSTRY AND CALIFORNIA AS OTHER STATES. ARE TRYING TO COMPETE WITH CALIFORNIA- LIKE GEORGIA. AND WHAT WOULD YOU BE ON THE TAX CREDIT TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR GROWING INDUSTRY. I CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT I MEAN I COULD WRITE PERSONALLY CAN'T SPEAK TO HOW INDIVIDUAL GREEN LIGHTING AND RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED FOR THE TRADE ASSOCIATION- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT DIVERSITY SHOULD BE IN CONSIDERATION WITH GREEN WRITING PROCESS. I'M A PROUD OF THE ROLE AGAIN THAT WE PLAY IN PROVIDING SORT OF THAT DATA THAT ALLOWS FOR. MAKING THE BUSINESS CASE FOR MORE DIVERSE STORYTELLING- AND CALIFORNIA'S LUCKY THAT WE'VE GOT GREAT CLIMATE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF GEOGRAPHY- BUT I THINK OUTSIDE OF THE TAX CREDIT I THINK IT'S ALSO THE SKILLS. OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE I'M INVESTING IN PROGRAMS LIKE THE NATIONAL SPENT NEED A COLLATION FIGHT NOT LEAVE LIKE GET A FORM SCHOOL OF HOLLYWOOD CPR ONLY BUILD THE TALENT. PIPELINE FOR US TO RECOUP FROM. THANK YOU. TWENTY FIVE. PLEASE I THINK THAT- IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE INCREDIBLE CAREERS IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT INITIATIVE BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT A LOT OF- STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE DRUGS ARE AND SO ARE CAREER READINESS PROGRAM IS AIMED AT EXPOSING THEM TO THESE JOBS WHICH IS ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- AND THE OTHER A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. OUTREACH TO FAMILIES WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WHILE WE MAY GET STUDENTS EXCITED ABOUT JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY THEIR PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CAREER IN THE FILM BUSINESS AND THEY DON'T CONSIDER WORKING NUMBERS S. PERHAPS AND SAID GOOD JOB- OPTION FOR THEIR FOR THEIR STUDENTS SO I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO OUTREACH TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST FOR INSTANCE VISUAL FAXES ONE AREA THAT HAS YOU KNOW RECENT THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE WHO'S SEEN YOU KNOW SPIDER MAN PERHAPS DOESN'T REALISE THAT FOR ONE SHOT IT MAY HAVE TAKEN THIRTY PEOPLE TO GO FROM THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF IT ALLTHE WAY TO THE CREATION OF THE SHOT THAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN THERE ARE SO MANY BELOW THE LINE CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL JOBS THAT EXIST THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF OUR REGION EDUCATION SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THESE JOBS ARE THERE AND YOU KNOW WE. CAN TRAIN THEM FOR THOSE DROPS. AND THE YES. THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU KNOW I EIGHT IN PREPARING FOR THIS HEARING AT AND ALSO INCREDIBLY TIMELY THAT THE SUNDAY. ARE THE OSCARS AND THE OSCARS ARE TAKING PLACE AT UNION STATION AND IN MY DISTRICT. AND THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES- TITLE YES THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS ARE MORE DIVERSE BUT THEY LARGELY LEAVE OUT LATINOS AND I FOUND THAT TO BE REALLY FASCINATING AND THAT- BEFORE THERE'S THE TRENDING HASHTAG OSCARS SO WHITE THAT'S BEEN. PREVALENT FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS NOW AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE OUR VIOLA DAVIS BECOMES THE MOST NOMINATED BLACK ACTRESS WITH HER LEAD ROLE FOR MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM STEVEN U. N. IS NOW THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN LEAD ACTOR NOMINATED FOR HIS WORK AND MANARI. REESE AHMAD IS- HOLD THE DISTINCTION FOR BEING THE FIRST MUSLIM TO BE NOMINATED FOR LEAD ACTOR FOR HIS ROLE IN SOUND OF METAL. AND THERE'S SO MANY GREAT EXAMPLES. BUT THERE ARE NO ALL LATINOS AND NOW AS SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE MATH AND THE ONLY CATEGORY IN WHICH WE SEE- THE LATIN ACTS OR LET ME KNOW EXPERIENCE ARE IN THE CATEGORY OF FOREIGN FILMS. FROM LATIN AMERICA- INTERNATIONAL FOREIGN FILMS AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE TO NOTE THAT DESPITE- THE CONSUMPTION OF LATINOS WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT ON ON THIS HEARING IN TERMS OF- ESPECIALLY THE FAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE WHICH IS- YOU KNOW BUT THERE WAS A STUDY MIDDLE A WHILE AGO THAT LET THE NOSE. CONTINUE TO WATCH THE THOSE THEORIES BECAUSE WE LOVE FAST CARS AND IF THE IF THE GREAT OF THE FILM FRANCHISE. BUT THAT EVEN IN THE OSCARS NOMINATION THE ONLY WAY THAT WE SEE OURSELVES IS ACTUALLY FORMED. NOW AMERICAN. RIGHT IT'S LIKE THE LATIN EXPERIENCE IS OUTSIDE. AND SO I IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A QUESTION FOR EVERYONE JUST A THOUGHT AND IF YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT I FIND IT FSCINATING IN TERMS OF. CHANGING THE NARRATIVE FOR LESS ENOUGH WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE STORIES THAT ARE TOLD ABOUT US BEING IN THIS COUNTRY. THE INTERNATIONAL AN INTERSECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF LATINOS AND STORYTELLING. A VIDA THE WHICH WE HEARD FROM EARLIER IS FILMED IN MY DISTRICT- AND SO IT'S- AND IT HAS A LOT OF VIBRANCY IN TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCES AS- MEXICAN AMERICANS ARE CHICANOS ARE LIVE NEXT- AND I JUST FIND IT FASCINATING THAT. DESPITE ALL THAT. EVEN IN THE OSCARS. WERE STILL ON SCENE HERE. I'M CURIOUS OF THE PANELISTS HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO SO TIMELY. NO NO. YEAH JUST JUST ABOUT IS IT'S OK I THINK BRANDON WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF OUR BIKES ARE NOT. YOU KNOW I LIKE. MY MIND BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS WELL FIRST OF ALL SHAMEFUL RIGHT. I MEAN RIGHT HERE IN LOS ANGELES THE OSCARS ARE TAKING PLACE A YEAR AFTER YEAR IS A CURSE. I HAVE TO SAY- IT WAS APRIL RAIN THE CAME UP WITH THE HASHTAG OSCARS SO WHITE AND I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER RIGHT NOW- AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR WHO CAME OUT HE SAID HE'S BOYCOTTING THE OSCARS. HE'S NOT GOING TO ATTEND HE DIDN'T ASK ANYBODY'S PERMISSION HEATING GO TO AN ORGANIZATION FOR SUPPORT HE JUST CAME OUT AND SAID. SOMETIMES I FEEL WE DO NOT HAVE. THAT. ONE POWERFUL VOICE THAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE INDUSTRY THAT'S NOT AFRAID IF THEY SPEAK UP THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THE PHONE STOPPED RINGING. I FEEL WE DON'T HAVE THAT REPRESENTATIVE I WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I. YOU KNOW WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH ANYTIME C. HAS BOYCOTTED THE OSCARS WE HAVE PROTEST IT AND PICK IT TOO. BUT WHERE AN ADVOCACY GROUP. WHERE IS THAT ONE PERSON OF INFLUENCE. IT'S WELL WE'RE NOT NOW DIRT AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S LATIN ACTS WILL SPEAK UP. YEAH BRENDA THAT IS SO POWERFUL AND SO IMPORTANT WHILE YOU'RE PUTTING. AND I'M EVEN AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN IN DIFFERENT TIMES GOT AFRAID TO PARTICIPATE- AND I THINK THAT'S TELLING I THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A THAT VOICE THAT PROTECTS OTHER VOICES- TO SPEAK UP IN A SENSE AS WELL THAT THAT MEGASTAR VOICE IF YOU WILL TO PROTECT OTHERS WHO KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM. BUT REALIZE THAT IF THEY BECOME THE TROUBLE MAKER IT MAY AFFECT THEIR CAREER SO- IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE STRUGGLE WITH IN GENERAL THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND- BUT IN THIS IN THIS PLACE IN PARTICULAR. MADAM CHAIR DID YOU SAY THEY WERE FEARFUL TO COME ON UHHUH YEAH WE HAD A NUMBER OF MY **** WHO YOU KNOW- WE'RE INTERESTED TALK TO US ABOUT ABOUT PROTESTING GIVE US BACKGROUND BUT DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK- AND YOU KNOW IT THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE I IT AGAIN I COME FROM ORGANIZING WORKERS AND SO THAT'S SO TYPICALAND ANY INDUSTRY- THEY KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM BUT THEY DON'T WANT ANY YOU KNOW IT OF COURSE YOU WOULD NEVER WANT- YOUR CAREER AFFECTED OR- THERE THERE WERE JUST AT. A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT WERE TOLD TO US SO I THINK I JUST THINK THAT'S TELLING- IN THIS INDUSTRY I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER WITH SPIKE LEE SPIKE LEE CAME OUT AND SAID I'M BOYCOTTING THE OSCARS OWN. WAIT WHILE DANTE. YEAH WELL WE'RE STILL LOOKING- FOR IT WE SHOULDN'T GET TO THAT POINT I MEAN AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WE SHOULD GET TO THAT POINT I'VE I'M GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW- IN INTAKE I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY COULD PUBLIC COMMENT THE QUEUE- DRIVEN.

IT'S SOMETIMES HARD BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FRIENDS AND WE FORGET WHERE WE ARE BUT THIS WAS A FABULOUS DISCUSSION AND I WANT TO POINT OUT- AS WITH ALL OF OUR HEARINGS. WE HAVE ONE EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT COULD BECAUSE NANCY'S OVER THE FILM COMMISSION BUT OTHERWISE. ALL THE PRESENTERS WERE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE END SCENE LEVINE A PROJECT BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE SHOWS THAT YES WE ARE UNDER REPRESENTED WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SHOWCASE THAT WERE OUT THERE WE HAVE THE RESEARCHERS WE HAVE OF THE ACADEMICS WHO DONE THE WORK WE HAVE. THAT THE PEOPLE IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT BEFORE THEN FROM THE CAMERA BEHIND THE CAMERA WRITING WE HAVE WOMEN WHO ARE HEADING ORGANIZATIONS IN ADVOCATING FOR THIS AND IT THE MOVIES AT THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION SO.

WHEN THEY YES I WANT TO THANK OUR OUR CHAIRWOMAN ASSEMBLYWOMAN GONZALEZ FOR THIS INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION. I THINK A- I'LL JUST POKE A LITTLE FUN AND SAY WHEN SOMEONE SAID THAT SOME PARENTS DON'T KNOW- YOU KNOW. THE IMPORTANCE OF. OR HOW INCREDIBLE A CAREER AND IN HOLLYWOOD FOR LETTING US CAN BE I THINK YOU'RE EXPERIENCING THAT. YOURSELF I JUST YOU KNOW I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO A FRIEND OF MINE LAUREN PEREZ WHO IS ONE OF THE- ORIGINAL ORGANIZERS WITH SAG AFTRA WHO WAS. FLYING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND MIAMI TO UNIONIZE THAT ORGANIZED. THE LIMINAL SOAP OPERA STARS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS PARITY BETWEEN. ENGLISH LANGUAGE AMERICAN MADE SOAP OPERAS AND- A SPANISH LANGUAGE LANGUAGE AMERICAN MYSELF UP FOR US AND SO IT'S- DESPITE THE LANGUAGE DIFFERENCE. THE PAY INEQUITY IS STILL A CONVERSATION THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE HAD IN TERMS OF- WHAT AT WHAT IS VALUED. AND WHAT TALENT IS VALUED AND REALLY AGAIN I WOULD ADD. THE ADVERTISING DOLLARS TO COME AROUND WANTED. TO ENSURE THAT A SHOW WAS SUCCESSFUL IT'S ALSO PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION AND ENSURING THAT. TELEVISION STUDIOS AS WELL AS MOVIE STUDIOS- REALLY PUT- MARKETING DOLLARS BEHIND. SHOWS WHERE THERE ARE LOTS THE NICE AS THE LEAD CHARACTERS WERE THERE ARE LATINOS AS- THE WRITERS WERE THERE ARE LATINOS AS THE SHOW RUNNERS. TO ENSURE THAT IT DOES IT'S NOT SET UP TO FAIL. AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT. AND ENSURING THAT THOSE DIVERSITY NUMBERS ARE INCLUDED IN REPORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING AND TAX DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO. PROPER REPRESENTATION. FOR THE STORIES THAT WE SEE ON TV THE STORIES THAT WE SEE. ON THE BIG SCREEN- AND A NEW EMERGING MARKET FOR DIGITAL PLATFORMS LIKE. HULU AND NETFLIX AND- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN AND SO THERE'S- IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SPACE RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW THAT WE HAVE MORE LETTING US IN THE LEGISLATURE. MORE WOMEN IN THE LEGISLATURE MORE I. IN THE LEAD. TO THAT. YOU KNOW WE PUT OUR OUR VET. WHERE THEY MATTER. AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH TOWARDS MORE EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA WHERE OUR STORIES ARE TOLD BY US AND NOT BY OTHERS SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION I LEARNED A LOT- AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION.

OUR STATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD FOCUS ON. AND THEN I WOULD COME IN AT THAT THE LATINO CAUCUS WITH TWENTY TO TWENTY NINE LEGISLATORS. COULD ADOPT ANY ONE OF THOSE AS A PRIORITY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD- AND- OF COURSE. WITH A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ BUT- THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT IDEAS THAT YOU ALL BROUGHT UP SO MANY ISSUES YOU BROUGHT UP BUT HELP US NARROW IT DOWN. SO THAT WE COULD USE OUR STRENGTH AND OUR VOICES AND REPRESENTATION IN A MUCH MORE FOCUSED WITH SO HELLO THANK OU ALL VERY MUCH IT WAS REALLY REALLY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU AND WE WILL IT WILL POSE THAT QUESTION TO ALL THE PANELS BUT WE'LL DO IT IN WRITING SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS- THAT IS THE ONE THING YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK TO.
