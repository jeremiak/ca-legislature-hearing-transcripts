BURKE REALLY WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:29.881
. AND THE INTERESTING THING WAS

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:32.117
AS WE FACED RIGHT AWAY THE FACT

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:35.320
THAT. DOCTORS WERE GOING THEIR-

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:37.655
OWN INSURANCE THAT WERE OBGYN

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:39.290
SAYS A. COUNTY WE WERE HIRING

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.359
NURSE MIDWIVES TO TRY TO

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:45.497
CONTINUE THE SERVICES THE CRISIS

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:47.699
THAT MICROCOSM FROM. WHETHER

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.167
THEY'RE STILL DEBATE ABOUT

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:51.236
WHETHER WAS MANIPULATED IN SOME

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:54.005
WAY BUT WAS REAL. AND YET WHEN

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:57.108
THE CAP WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:57.675
SEVENTY FIVE THE PURCHASING

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:01.379
POWER IS NOW SOMETHING LIKE 25%

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:05.016
OF WHAT THAT SAME AMOUNT WAS. IN

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.252
THAT YEAR AND FOR THOSE OF US

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:10.688
HERE ARE WE'VE EXPERIENCED THIS

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:13.291
AS A POLITICAL FAULT LINE IT TOO

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:14.993
WHEN I RAN FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.595
IN TWENTY TEN THERE WAS A MAJOR

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.631
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE AGAINST

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:23.168
ME BECAUSE I ADVOCATED INDEXING

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:27.472
THIS JUST INDEXING GET. BEEN IN

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.807
TWENTY TWENTY MY POSITION WAS

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.375
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.976
TO DISCUSS THIS AND GET TO A

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.311
SOLUTION AND THAT IS WHAT

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.513
HAPPENED THAT IS WHAT HAS

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.083
HAPPENED HERE. AND IT IS REALLY

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:40.018
SIGNIFICANT THIS IS A

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:43.121
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND IT IS

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:45.557
SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALL OF US

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:46.758
HAD ALWAYS HOPED FOR BUT NEVER

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.393
THOUGHT WAS TRUE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.597
THEN SO I REALLY SALUTE EVERYONE

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.232
BECAUSE- HEY YOU COULD NEVER

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:56.267
KEEP A SECRET IN SACRAMENTO AND

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:59.170
THIS WAS FOR SOME REASON CAPT

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:02.440
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. BUT

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.209
THERE WAS A LOT OF RISK TAKING

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.111
HERE. MY SUSPICION IS IF THIS

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:09.247
PROPOSAL HAD BEEN LEAKED AT THE

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:11.182
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS. ARE

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.617
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.018
OF GROUPS THAT TESTIFIED IN

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.487
SUPPORT THAT WOULD HAD A REAL

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:17.489
TOUGH TIME HOLDING THEIR

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.290
CONSTITUENTS TOGETHER FOR IT.

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:21.659
AND I THINK WHEN THERE WAS A

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.728
GIVE AND TAKE THAT WAS REALLY

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:26.464
GOOD AND REALLY EVERYBODY GOT

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:28.133
SOMETHING OUT OF IT AND IT WAS

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:30.101
ENOUGH FOR THE INITIATIVE NOT TO

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:33.972
GO. TO NOVEMBER IT IS A MASSIVE

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:35.540
VICTORY AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.242
HI HOPE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:40.478
FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THIS WILL.

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.413
WILL INDEX GOING FORWARD THAT

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.516
THIS REMOVED SAYS AN ISSUE EVEN

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:46.818
AND YEARS OR FURTHER ALTHOUGH OF

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:48.620
COURSE THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.455
HAS THE RIGHT. TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.223
WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AND

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.058
SEE IF THEY WARRANT. ANY

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:58.363
CONSIDERATION. AND I WAS ALL SET

00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:59.564
AT THIS MOMENT. TO SPEAK TO

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:01.366
THOSE THAT OPPOSED TO THE

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:02.233
MEASURE. OF WHICH THERE WERE

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.170
NONE. BECAUSE I WAS PREPARED TO

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.305
SAY AND EVEN IF THERE'S ONE OUT

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:09.240
THERE LISTENING. IS THAT

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.910
BASICALLY. WHATEVER THE POSITION

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.878
WAS THAT PEOPLE HAD SO STRONGLY

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.346
THAT THEY WOULD OPPOSE THIS

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:16.347
MEASURE IS THE REASON THERE

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:17.715
NEVER BEEN A SOLUTION SINCE IT

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:20.185
WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.320
FIVE. THAT IT REALLY TOOK SOME

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.788
GIVE AND TAKE IT RALLY TOOK

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.490
EVERYBODY PROTECTING THEIR OWN

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.425
INTERESTS SO THAT. THE PROVIDERS

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.661
FEEL SOME LEVEL OF PROTECTION

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.262
BUT CONSUMERS ABSOLUTELY GET A

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.198
LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.465
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S A

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:35.867
STAKEHOLDER WAS INVOLVED IN

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:39.204
THIS. SO I JUST I AM PROUD TO BE

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.406
A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS.

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.740
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU. THAT

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:45.176
WONDER WHY. IN THE NEXT WEEK I

DIFFERENT FONTS OF THE PENAL

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.718
CODE IT'S BECAUSE I WAS HOLDING

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:57.322
IT FOR THIS PURPOSE IT AND SO I

00:30:57.388 --> 00:31:00.925
THINK IT WILL. IT WILL- MAYBE

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.493
CENTER DRAWS SO WE'LL GET HER

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.329
LABOR BILL ON CLIMATE OUT OF THE

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.364
PHONE BILLS OR SOMETHING WILL

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:08.299
HAPPEN BUT I JUST WANT TO SALUTE

SAYS. SACRAMENTO DOESN'T WORK.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.342
AFTER WE PASS THIS BILL AND

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:19.244
SIGNED INTO LAW WE SHOULD POINT

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.613
EVERYBODY TO THIS BECAUSE OF THE

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.848
COMPROMISE THAT WAS MADE AND

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:25.450
EVERYBODY'S HANDS IN. IN THE

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.252

GOVERNMENT WORKING I DO AGREE

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.381
WITH THE HISTORY BECAUSE WHEN

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.116
YOU'RE AT A POINT IN HISTORY ONE

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.951
REFLECT ON THOSE WHO WERE HERE

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:01.519
BEFORE AND WITH THEIR

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.154
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE BUT I THINK.

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:05.156
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:07.659
THAT ISN'T INFORMED BY. THE

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:09.594
SUBJECT MATTER WE HAVE BEFORE US

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.929
BUT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:15.099
GOVERNMENT WORK. IS THIS EFFORT

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.035
BY SENATOR STEINBERG CENTER

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.404
VIDEO CENTER DELEON SOME YEARS

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.439
AGO IN COORDINATION WITH JUSTICE

ROSSO INJURED CHIEF JUSTICE

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:25.643
STRONG GEORGIAN OTHERS. IT

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.045
BROUGHT BACK THIS INDIRECT

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.946
INITIATIVE WHEN MR RALLY FAR

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.581
FOOTBALLER NICK FULL OF FILED

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.250
THIS MEASURE UNDER THE LAW

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.451
BEFORE THE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:35.253
OPPORTUNITY FOR THERE TO BE

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.954
DISCUSSION BECAUSE ONCE THOSE

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.223
BOXES OF SIGNATURES WHEN ACROSS

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.493
THE DESK- THEY THEY WERE- HE WAS

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.329
ON THE MEASURE WAS ON THE BALLOT

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.963
THAT WAS THE LAW. CURRENTLY

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.732
BEING USED TO ALWAYS BE LONG

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.067
CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.635
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A MOMENT TO

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.403
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.439
PROCESS SO THAT IT ALLOWS FOR

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:57.342
DISCUSSION BETWEEN A PROPONENT.

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.844
OF A AND THE ADVOCATES THE

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.979
LEGISLATURE THE PROCESS TO TRY

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.481
TO GET THE LAW RIGHT BUT I THINK

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:05.750
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:06.417

BEFORE TODAY. AND SO I JUST

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:25.682

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.616
OF THE AMENDMENTS SIMPLY STATES

THAT ARE THE MOST SIMPLE BILLS

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.437

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.408
THE OPPOSITIONAL STATEMENT AND

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:55.278
THE- ANALYSIS FROM ONE OF THE

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:57.714
OPPONENTS THAT SAID- THIS WAS A

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:00.016
SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:02.519
SO COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT.

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.354
HI I AM NOT CERTAIN I COULD

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.689
DISAGREE MORE RESPECTFULLY BUT

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:10.860

JUST WENT THROUGH A VERY AMAZING

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:17.033

COUNTERVAILING FORCES COMING

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.406
TOGETHER. I THINK THIS IS

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.642
NOWHERE NEAR NEAR NEAR THAT LEAK

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.143

MOVING INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.682
POSITIONS. AND I THINK WHAT

00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:34.717
WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE PAST IS

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.920
THAT. INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE

A DOCUMENT THAT CAN DO WITH SOME

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.240
IMPROVEMENT AND I THINK EVEN THE

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.875
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.211
IDENTIFIED THAT ONE AREA THAT

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:03.379
WON'T OBVIATE ANY EXISTING

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:05.148
RIGHTS SUPPORT LEGAL PROTECTIONS

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:09.619
IS SIMPLY TO IDENTIFY. THAT IF

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:11.621
THERE ARE TECHNICAL- BIOLASE. OR

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.523

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:56.526
WOULD HAVE READ THIS ANALYSIS

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:57.727
BEFORE IT WOULD HAVE JUMPED OFF

00:59:57.794 --> 01:00:00.863
THAT BOAT BACK IN THE QUEUE BUT-

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.566
I LEFT FILE MY VOTES MY QUESTION

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:07.603
IS THAT. IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.205
DISTINCTION TO BE MADE WITH

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.374
CODIFYING NEIGHBOR I GET THAT

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.743
FOR THESE MINOR BITS BUT THIS IS

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.078
EXTENDING IT TO ALL

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.579
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS WHAT IS

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.247

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:24.354
I. R. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.722
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.757
SOME OF THESE OTHER DOCUMENTS

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:29.525
THAT ARE YOU KNOW NOT A FULL E.

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:34.030
I. R. WOULD BE SWEPT UP IN THE-

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.665
THIS BILL AS AMENDED. WELL IN

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:36.499
ALL IN ALL LEAVE OPEN THE

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.534
OPPORTUNITY FOR MORGAN TO

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.571
COMMENT FURTHER- THAT I. IN THE

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.306
IR IS GOING TO HAVE A COMPANY

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.174
DOCUMENTS IN SO WHAT'S IT WHAT

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:47.043
HAPPENS I THINK OVER TIME. IS

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.878
THAT CERTAIN OTHER PARALLEL-

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.414
SUBMISSIONS- FEDERAL PART OF THE

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.016
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OR THE

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.617
LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT IS

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.319
REVIEWING THE MATTERS BEFORE IT

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.121
OR REGULATORY ENTITY. THEY'RE

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.857
GOING TO HAVE A VERY SIMILAR. N

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:03.359
OUR EXPECTATION THROUGH THIS

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:04.427
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.030
DECISION THAT A MERE TECHNICAL

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:09.132
VIOLATIONS SHOULDN'T OBVIATE-

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.467
THE- THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:16.072
ER. OR DEFEAT FOR THE PERIL

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:16.973
DOCUMENTATION THAT COULD GO

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.840
ALONG WITH THAT. I GUESS THE

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.675
QUESTION IS THAT THAT PROCESS

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.411
YOU GO THROUGH AND THE SEQUEL

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.646
THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION IS THE

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.348
PUBLIC COULD BE DEPRIVED OF THAT

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:26.616
ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THAT IF

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.718
THERE. IF THESE OTHER

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.186
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS TO

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.088
DETERMINE TO BE MERE TECHNICAL

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.123
ERRORS I MEAN IF YOU KNOW IN AS

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.959
WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS- IF

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:37.560
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OF

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:40.563
CONCERN- TO YOU SENATOR HI. I

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.864
WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK FURTHER

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:44.834
INTO THAT AND IF FOR FURTHER

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:45.802
REFINEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.905
NECESSARY- I GIVE YOU MY WORD

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.206
THAT- I WILL I WILL MAKE

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.241
CORRESPONDING CHANGES. JUST AS

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.810
I'VE MADE THE- THE AMENDMENTS

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.278
THAT THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:56.712
HAVE RECOMMENDED BE MADE IN

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.613
ORDER TO MOVE THIS PROCESS

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.682
FORWARD. I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO SO

AS WELL. OKAY THE OTHER OF

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.353
OBJECTION OR THE OTHER CONCERN

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.856
IS FOOTNOTES TO SO I APOLOGIZE I

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.724
DID NOT READ FOOTNOTE TO ON THIS

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.726
I THINK THIS DECISION BUT TALKS

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.595
ABOUT THE MERCH MAJORITY OF THE

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.830
SUPREME COURT DIDN'T. DIDN'T

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.698
COME TOGETHER MORALITY AND WHAT

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:21.437
IS THE- ABUSE OF DISCRETION

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:25.708
THAT'S USED ON THAT. AND WHETHER

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.543
IT'S- SUBSTANTIAL MOSTLY

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.712
SUBSTANTIAL AND SIGNIFICANT AS A

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:37.186
WHOLE. RAINBOW OF DIFFERENT- HI

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.688
DECISIONS THAT THEY CAN BE FULL

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:41.491
PICKING FOUR ONE N. I'M

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:42.558
WONDERING THAT'S STILL IN THE

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:46.362
BILL. RIGHT. AND I'M I'M

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:56.806
WONDERING- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:59.075
THIS NEW DEFINITION WHY DO WE

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.444
NEED THIS NEW DEFINITION IF

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:03.312
PRACTITIONERS COULD RELY ON

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:05.448
NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:08.451
DECISION ANYWAY. WELL THIS

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.685
LANGUAGE FROM THE NEIGHBORS

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:12.054
DECISION IS PERSUASIVE BUT IS

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.489
STRICTLY SPEAKING NOT BINDING ON

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.458
LOWER COURTS BECAUSE IT WAS FROM

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.893
A PLURALITY OPINION IN THIS

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:17.426
DECISION SO THERE WAS NO

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.428
MAJORITY THE COURT THAT SIGNED

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:20.530
ON TO THIS LANGUAGE AND

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.398
PRACTITIONERS IN THIS FIELD.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.866
HAVE POINTED TO THIS LANGUAGE

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.368
AND SAID IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:27.370
HELPFUL IF WAS. IF IT WAS

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:29.305
BINDING- THERE HAVE BEEN CASES

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.606
THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.775
DECISIONS AND SOME- PUBLISHED

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:34.410
DECISIONS THAT HAVE RELIED ON

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.379
THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ABOUT FIVE

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.713
PUBLISHED DECISIONS FIVE ON

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.215
PUBLISHERS SESSION SO THEY HAVE

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.650
USED IT BUT IT'S- STRICTLY

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.185
SPEAKING NOT BINDING ON THE

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.619
LOWER COURTS BECAUSE AGAIN IT IT

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.121
WAS A PLURALITY OPINION SO

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:48.658
THAT'S- PART OF THE REASON WHY-

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.760
WE- BROUGHT THIS BUT WE WORK ON

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.461
THIS BILL BECAUSE IT JUST. SEEMS

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.430
HELPFUL TO ELEVATE THIS LANGUAGE

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.265
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.501
APPLICABLE TO ALL PROJECTS AND

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.503
ALL COURTS LOOKING AT THIS BUT

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.004
DOESN'T THAT DROP OUT SOME OF

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.873
THE CLAIMS THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.810
ON WHETHER THE IT SIGNIFICANT

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:08.811
IMPACTS. ON THE ENVIRONMENT

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:11.080
VERSUS. I GUESS MERELY LACK OF-

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.716
BY SHOWING A LACK OF. USE OF

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.551
DISCRETION. YOU SEE WHAT I'M

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.687
SAYING IS THAT. YOU WANT TO SEE

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.255
THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.890
AND WHETHER IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.459
IMPACT BECAUSE PROPONENTS WOULD

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.194
LIKE TO SEE THAT DISCUSS FIRST

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:28.531
IS WHETHER THE- TRIER OF. HIS

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.566
ABUSING THEIR DISCRETION OR

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.268
ALLEGED OF ABUSING THEIR

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.003
DISCRETION RIGHT. WELL THERE'S

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.638
LANGUAGE IN THE DECISION AND I

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.707
THINK THIS IS THE IT GOES INTO

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:39.742
THE BILL TO THAT LANGUAGE FROM-

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.978
THE CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT. WHAT

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.913
IS A AND IT'S SUBSTANTIAL. OR

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.514
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THEY SPEAK

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.984
TO WHETHER YOU KNOW IT. IT IT

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.118
DEPRIVES THE PUBLIC OF

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.553
SUBSTANTIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.188
ARE PROJECTS SO THAT IS THE

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.422
DETERMINATION THAT THE COURTS

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.223
WOULD LIKELY MAKE. IN

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.791
DETERMINING IN IN DECIDING

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.360
WHETHER OR NOT TO ISSUE RELIEF

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:58.628
THEY WOULDN'T YOU KNOW

01:04:58.694 --> 01:04:59.895
NECESSARILY. DENY SOMEONE THE

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:02.064
CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR CASE THEY

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.566
WOULD. YOU KNOW LET BOTH SIDES.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.134
PRESENT THEIR SIDE AND THEN THEY

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:05.735
WOULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.236
WHAT WAS THERE. WAS A

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.272
SUBSTANTIAL VIOLATION OR A

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.439
TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF THE

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.308
SENATE SO I GUESS I GUESS THE

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.376
OPPOSITION THIS IS SAYING THAT

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.845
THESE THIS IS ANOTHER LAYER

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.346
THAT'S PART PUTTING INTO THIS-

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:18.814
SUBJECTIVE STANDARDS FOR THESE

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.683
FAKE STANDARDS. IN DETERMINING A

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.752
SEQUEL VIOLATIONS WHO IS

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:26.322
PREJUDICIAL MAY HAVE. ADD MORE

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:27.723
CONFUSION RATHER THAN

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.860
CLARIFICATION THAT'S OPPOSITION.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.362
I'M AND I'M I THINK A AS WE'VE

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.398
SEEN THIS THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:38.534
AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER- BILLS-

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.038
THERE IS A THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.406
OF A REFLEX THAT OCCURS- WHERE

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:46.475
MATTERS CAN BE- CONFUSED- BUT IN

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.512
REAL TERMS- ARE NOT CONFUSING I

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:52.748
THINK THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT AS

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.383
CLEAR. A SITUATION AS YOU CAN

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.485
HAVE WHERE THE CALIFORNIA

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.554
SUPREME COURT DECISION HAS

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.189
LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:03.959
CODIFY THAT IS INSTRUCTIVE IN

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:07.296
NATURE. AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:09.365
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND WHY

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.232
IT HAS ACHIEVED SUCCESS IS

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.535
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS EVEN THOSE

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.670
WHO ARE NATURAL PROPONENTS OF

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.105
PROTECTING THE SANK WITH

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:18.541
SANCTITY OF SYKORA. UNDERSTAND

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.276
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A DEGREE

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.144
OF COMMON SENSE AND

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:23.412
REASONABLENESS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.815
INSUBSTANTIAL OR TECHNICAL ODD

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.216
OUTSIDE ISSUES THAT COULD

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:30.886
DERAIL. A PROCESS FOR MOVING

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:34.824

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.908
HIGHLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO IF

THERE MIGHT BE A TECHNICAL

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.880
VIOLATION. OF A OF HELP

TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT IT OFFERS

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:49.632
NO PREJUDICIAL EFFECT. SO TECH A

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.301
TECHNICAL VIOLATION THAT'S NOT

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.503

FORECLOSURE TRUSTEES WHO HANDLE

THESE FORECLOSURES THEY ARE NOT

GENERAL TRUSTEES. AS IN A

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:31.085
CONSERVATORSHIP WE'RE VERY

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.820
SYMPATHETIC TO THE PROBLEM WE DO

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.889
WITH NO ONE WANTS ANY PERSON TO

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.958
LOSE EQUITY PARTICULARLY ELDERLY

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.726
HOMEOWNERS AND WE'VE HAD

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.094
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:42.196
THE AUTHOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:44.566
DO THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.367
PRACTICAL AND LEGAL PROBLEMS IN

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:48.236
THE BILL IT IS CREATIVE IT IS

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:49.904
WELL INTENTIONED BUT I THINK

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.172
THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.607
BIGGEST ONE. IS THAT THE

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.776
HOMEOWNER HIM OR HERSELF IS NOT

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:56.644
INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS THERE'S

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.246
AN ACTUAL HOME OWNER OF THE

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.548
HOUSE BUT THE TRUSTEE IS

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.450
SUPPOSED TO SELECT AN APPRAISER

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.619
WHO IS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.321
TO THE HOUSE AND THEY'RE GOING

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:07.822
TO TRY AND MAKE AN INFORMED

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.024
EVALUATION TO ESTABLISH THIS

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:12.160
FAIR MARKET VALUE. THEY ARE THEN

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:14.596
SUPPOSED TO HIRE A REALTOR AND

01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:16.731
GO THROUGH OFFERS ON THE HOUSE

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.499
AGAIN WITH NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.735
HOMEOWNER SO THAT IS IT THAT

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.503
RAISES A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.439
PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF LIABILITY

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:25.673
SOMEBODY WILL SAY WE HAVE

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.742
SELECTED THE WRONG APPRAISER YOU

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.611
SELECTED THE WRONG REALTOR YOU

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:31.479
SELECTED THE WRONG OFFER ON THE

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.281
HOUSE. BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNERS

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.917
COMPLETELY ON INVOLVED IN THIS

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.685
PROCESS LEGALLY TRUSTEES HAVE NO

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.621
ABILITY UNDER THE DEED OF TRUST

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.456
TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:43.758
SOMEBODY OWNS THE HOUSE AND THEY

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:45.126
HAVE A SERIES OF RIGHTS

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:48.229
INCLUDING TO REFI. TO SEEK HELP

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.632
FROM A RELATIVE PERHAPS TO

STOP TO THE FORECLOSURE

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.436
PROCEEDINGS SO THERE ARE LEGAL

01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:57.772
PROBLEMS AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.540
BUT WE DO AGREE THAT EVERYONE

CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.708
PROPOSAL FOR CONCEPTUAL AND

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:08.743
MECHANICAL REASONS CONCEPTUALLY

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.144
WE STRUGGLE WITH THE IDEA OF

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:11.946
TAKING A BORROWER MOST OF THE

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.081
WAY THROUGH THE NON JUDICIAL

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:16.918
FORECLOSURE PROCESS FOR TRYING

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.519
TO SELL THE PROPERTY ON THE OPEN

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:19.554

HOMEOWNERS AWARENESS THAT IF

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.628
THEY HAVE THAT WOULD BE IN THE

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.496

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:31.265
SELL THE PROPERTY UNDER THEIR

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:32.867
TERMS AND THEIR DIRECT. I CAN'T

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:34.402

PULLING TOGETHER WHAT THEY NEED

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:38.859
IF THERE'S AN OVER BID. AND THEN

THEY TAKE THE RISK RIGHT AND

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:42.296
THEN THEY SELL IT AND PROVIDE

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:44.331
THE PROTECTIONS TO THE NEXT

01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:46.167
WHETHER IT'S THEIR BANK THAT

DOESN'T QUITE OFTEN IN MANY

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.235
CASES THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.403

THEY JUST GO FROM AUCTION TO

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.609
AUCTION TO BUY STUFF BECAUSE

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:57.778
THEY LOOK AT A REPORT TO RIP YOU

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.647
OFF AND BY YOUR HOUSE FOR FIFTY

01:36:59.713 --> 01:37:00.614
THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS WOULD A

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:01.715
HER THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKE A

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:02.449
PROFIT RIGHT. BUT THEY DON'T

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.385
HAVE TITLE INSURANCE THEY HAVE

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.187
NO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THEN

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:08.389
THEY PUT IN THE MARKET WITH A

01:37:08.455 --> 01:37:09.657
REALTOR TO DO THAT. HURTING THE

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:11.425
CONSUMER WHO WHO'S BEEN TAKING

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.060
WHETHER EQUITY SO I'M SUGGESTING

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:17.364
IS YOU. THINK THIS THING THROUGH

YOU CAN- THE- TO. TRAVEL HOME.

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:23.170
SO THAT ANYBODY WHO BUYS IT

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:24.638
WOULD HAVE NOTICE OF WHAT THE

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:25.339
PROBLEMS WERE IF THERE'S

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.575
TERMITES OR- WHATEVER THE CASE

MAY BE THE KINDS OF THINGS TO

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.711
GET THROUGH HOME INSPECTION. TO

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.846
SOMEONE BUYS THIS. THERE'S SOME

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:34.148
LEVEL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION I'M

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:36.350
A SUPPORT THIS TODAY. FOR SERIES

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.185

ON YOU. BUT I DO THINK IS WE

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:46.927
THINK THROUGH. THIS DIAGNOSTIC

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.495
ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT LAW IS

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:51.165
HOW IT'S UNFAIR. TO TWO PEOPLE

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:52.533
AND WE SEE. WE SEE THESE

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.868
HORRIBLE STORIES. BUT CAO THEN

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:57.838
YOU PROTECT THE CONSUMER ON THE

01:37:57.905 --> 01:37:59.473
FLIP SIDE. WITH THE JUST MARRIED

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.575

JEFF TO MAKE AND THE LIKE. AND

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.681
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT. A BUYER WHO'S

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:10.284
GOING TO PAY. THAT EXTRA MONEY

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.553
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE REST OF

I'M JUST. IT NEEDS MORE. IN THAT

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:25.512
REGARD I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:26.480
CONCERN- WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:28.415
RESPONSE AND THE WAY THAT THIS

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.483
CONCERN IS ADDRESSED THROUGH

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.185
THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT THE BUYER

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:34.855
IS ABLE TO SUBMIT. OFFERS FOR

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.657

WITH THE WITH THE WHOLE THING

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:43.197
AND SO IF THE CONTINGENCIES

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:43.864
AREN'T LIFTED LIFTED IF THEY'RE

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.532
NOT ABLE TO INSPECT THE PROPERTY

CONDITION. IF THE HOMEOWNER

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:49.603
WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE SALE.

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:51.805
THEN THE CONTINGENCY WON'T BE

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:53.407
LISTED IN THE SALE WON'T GO

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:54.608
THROUGH. I'M IN THAT WAY THE

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:55.609
CONSUMER WILL BE PROTECTED

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:57.177

UNLIKE THE AUCTION SYSTEM NOW.

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.215
RIGHT BECAUSE THESE THESE

BIDDERS TO GO TO THE AUCTION.

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.151
AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:05.385
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK INSIDE THE

OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OFFERS WITH

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:12.259
CONTINGENCIES. AND SO THERE'S A

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:14.595
LOT OF BIG DIDN'T RISK THERE

01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:16.797
THAT DRIVES DOWN THE AUCTION

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.298
PRICE. OR THE PRICE MIGHT BE

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:20.701
HIGHER IF THERE'S AN MLS OFFER

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:22.536

INSPECTION DATA ON THESE THINGS

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:36.350
I'VE SEEN IT I KNOW HOW THIS

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:37.784
WORKS. AND BUT THE INSPECTION IS

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:40.921
FROM SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE WHO

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:41.989
ARE LOOKING TO BOTTOM FISH

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.190
RIGHT. NOW YOU CAN ALL OF A

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.025
SUDDEN INTERJECTED CONSUMERS AND

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.960

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SO YOU WANT

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.273

BY THE- THIS BILL. IN ALMOST

02:27:23.734 --> 02:27:25.536
EVERY ONE OF THOSE CASES. THE

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:34.011
REFUSE TO SETTLE FOR THE POLICY

02:27:34.078 --> 02:27:36.347

THE TIME LIMITED DEMAND BUT

DIDN'T ACCEPT IT. BUT THE TRUTH

02:27:44.522 --> 02:27:47.325
OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN MOST OF

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.960
THESE CASES. RESENT THAT THE

THE EARLIER TIME WHEN THE DEMAND

02:27:52.663 --> 02:27:54.131

CONDITIONS THAT WERE CALCULATED

02:28:06.244 --> 02:28:07.478
TO BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY

02:28:07.545 --> 02:28:09.313
TO TRIP UP AND NOT ACCEPT THE

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.349
DEMAND. TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:28:11.415 --> 02:28:13.484
ABOUT ARE CASES THAT COULD AND

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:15.086
SHOULD BE SETTLED FOR THE

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:17.121
INSURANCE POLICY LIMITS. BUT

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:19.757
THEY AREN'T AND THIS BILL IS

02:28:19.824 --> 02:28:21.392
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:23.928
PROBLEM. AND ONE THING THAT THE

02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:24.962
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY NOT

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:26.864

02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:28.399
HELPFUL TO INSURANCE COMPANIES.

02:28:28.466 --> 02:28:31.002
MOST IMPORTANT BENEFICIARIES OF

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.069
THE BILLS AREN'T INSURANCE

02:28:32.136 --> 02:28:35.006
COMPANIES BUT OUR POLICYHOLDERS

02:28:35.072 --> 02:28:37.341
HEATING THE PEOPLE WHO. CURRENTS

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:39.477
YOU KNOW TECH THEMSELVES FROM MY

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.345
BILL. AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:43.614
POLICY HOLDERS ARE THE ONES THAT

02:28:43.681 --> 02:28:44.448
BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL YOU HAVE

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:47.218
TO UNDERSTAND. WHY INSURANCE BAD

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:49.754
FAITH LAW EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:50.988
THAT'S THE LAW THAT REQUIRES

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.590
INSURANCE COMPANY JUST TO SETTLE

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:54.925
CASES. WITHIN THE LIMITS WHEN

02:28:54.992 --> 02:28:56.294
THEY KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW THAT IF

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:57.795
THEY DON'T THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:28:57.862 --> 02:28:59.530
AN EXCESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THEIR

02:28:59.597 --> 02:29:01.999
POLICY HOLDERS. IF THAT HAPPENS

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:04.101
IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY CAN BE

02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:05.202
LIABLE FOR THAT ACT THIS

02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:07.672
JUDGMENT. SO THE LAW OF BAD

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:10.574
FAITH WAS CREATED. BY THE COURTS

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:11.876
FOR TWO REASONS FIRST WHICH TO

02:29:11.942 --> 02:29:13.377
ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC

02:29:13.444 --> 02:29:15.313
POLICY THAT FAVORS SETTLEMENTS.

02:29:15.379 --> 02:29:17.114
AND SECOND. TO PROTECT

02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:19.350
POLICYHOLDERS FROM BEING DRAGGED

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:21.852
THROUGH LITIGATION AND BEING

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:23.587
SUBJECTED TO ACCESS JUDGMENTS.

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:26.057
THE PURPOSE OF BAD FAITH LAW BUT

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:27.258
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS VERY LAW

02:29:27.325 --> 02:29:29.260
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE

02:29:29.327 --> 02:29:29.760
SETTLEMENTS AND PROTECT

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:32.363
POLICYHOLDERS. HAS BEEN

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:34.732
WEAPONIZED TO. BE USED FOR THE

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:36.734
EXACT OPPOSITE PER PURPOSE AND

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:39.337
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. IS THAT

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:41.739
BASED ON THIS LAW ANYTIME THERE

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:45.242
IS A- CLAIM INVOLVING INJURIES

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.644
AND DAMAGES THAT EXCEED THE

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.546
AVAILABLE INSURANCE. THE GOAL OF

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:51.082
THE PLAINTIFF IS NOT IT SETTLE

02:29:51.148 --> 02:29:53.017
FOR THE POLICY LIMIT BUT RATHER.

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:54.051
TO CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT

02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:55.419
THEY ARE TRYING TO SETTLE FOR

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:57.121
THE POLICY LIMIT. SO THAT THEY

02:29:57.188 --> 02:29:59.023
CAN ARGUE LATER THAT THE

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:00.057
INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD BE

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:02.126
LIABLE FOR WHATEVER JUDGMENT

02:30:02.193 --> 02:30:04.762
HAPPENS AND THEY DO THAT. BY

02:30:04.829 --> 02:30:06.764
MAKING DEMANDS THAT THEY KNOW

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:08.532
WON'T BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE EITHER

02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:10.968
THE TIME LIMIT IS TOO SHORT. OR

02:30:11.035 --> 02:30:12.937
THE AND FOR IN THE THEY'RE NOT-

02:30:13.003 --> 02:30:13.971
ACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE

02:30:14.038 --> 02:30:15.306
INFORMATION FOR THE INSURANCE

02:30:15.373 --> 02:30:17.241
COMPANY CAN FAIRLY EVALUATE WHAT

02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:18.809
THE DAMAGES ARE WORTH OR THEY

02:30:18.876 --> 02:30:20.911
MAY ENGAGE IN OTHER TACTICS TO

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:22.646
MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THE

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:24.248
INSURANCE COMPANY. HAS AN

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:25.616
OPPORTUNITY TO SETTLE BUT THEN

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:27.918
THEY ARGUE THAT CURRENT COMPANY

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.587
SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR ANY

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:30.888
RESULTING JUDGMENT BUT WHO IS

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:32.656
THE TRUE VICTIM OF THIS TACTIC

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:34.658
THE TRUE VICTIM. IS THE POLICY

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:38.129
HOLDER- BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:39.864

SOMETIMES YEARS OF LITIGATION

AND SOMETIMES SUBJECTED. TO AN

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:46.837
EXCESS JUDGMENT THAT IS PUT ON

02:30:46.904 --> 02:30:48.038

02:58:00.169 --> 02:58:01.303
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT

02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:04.173
UP- THAT'S ONE. WHICH THEN LEADS

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.442
TO I THINK THERE WAS A- A RECORD

02:58:06.509 --> 02:58:08.110
OF THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU TEST

02:58:08.177 --> 02:58:10.746
THE TECHNOLOGY- PRIOR TO

02:58:10.813 --> 02:58:12.481
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING GIVING

02:58:12.548 --> 02:58:15.117
TICKETS OUT. OF AND I THINK-

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:16.752
SIMILAR DISSENTER GONZALEZ YOU

02:58:16.819 --> 02:58:20.322
KNOW THE EQUITY ISSUE. WHICH

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:22.992
COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE. THE

02:58:23.059 --> 02:58:24.627
MY- THE NUMBER THINGS THAT

02:58:24.693 --> 02:58:27.029
HAPPEN THAT IMPACT FOR

02:58:27.096 --> 02:58:29.131
COMMUNITIES MORE THAN THAN OTHER

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:33.436
COMMUNITIES- AND- I TAKES MORE

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:35.738
DETAILED QUESTIONS BUT IF A

02:58:35.805 --> 02:58:38.474
MOTORIST GETS A VIOLATION-

02:58:38.541 --> 02:58:40.443
RECEIVES A VIOLATION HOW DO THEY

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:43.879
HOW DO THEY FIGHT THAT TICKET

02:58:43.946 --> 02:58:45.614
YOU KNOW. IF THEY GET A CITATION

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:47.483
. WHAT IS THEIR WAY OF FIGHTING

02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:50.953
BACK- I KNOW I GOTTA TAKE IT

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:53.155
ONCE. AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT OF

02:58:53.222 --> 02:58:54.590
FOR GOING THROUGH AN

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.559
INTERSECTION WITH A I WILL GO

02:58:56.625 --> 02:58:59.662
ANY MORE DETAILS BUT- THERE WAS

02:58:59.728 --> 02:59:01.430
RIGHT DO YOU VIEW IS THAT RIGHT

02:59:01.497 --> 02:59:02.731
DOES YOUR LAWYER I'D SUGGEST GO

02:59:02.798 --> 02:59:05.067
AHEAD. ANYWAY IT WAS A PICTURE

02:59:05.134 --> 02:59:06.335
WITH YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:09.171
CAMERON THE INTERSECTION AND- NO

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:11.674
MATTER WHAT I DID I JUST I JUST

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.476
COULDN'T FIGHT FIGHT THAT TICKET

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:15.311
BUT THAT'S OBVIOUS I MEAN THAT

02:59:15.377 --> 02:59:19.815
IS CLEAR CUT- I JUST DON'T KNOW

02:59:19.882 --> 02:59:21.417
HOW ELSE. SOMEBODY COULD. OF BY

02:59:21.484 --> 02:59:22.985
THE CITATION FOR SOMETHING LIKE

02:59:23.052 --> 02:59:25.721
THIS- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF MY-

02:59:25.788 --> 02:59:30.159
QUESTIONS- WALTZ JUST DO WITHOUT

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.727
IF YOU WITH THE CHURCH BELLS AND

02:59:31.794 --> 02:59:33.429
SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:35.998
TRYING TO NARROW THIS TO GET AT

02:59:36.065 --> 02:59:37.600
THE HEART OF THE MATTER AND I

02:59:37.666 --> 02:59:40.069
WOULD. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IN

02:59:40.136 --> 02:59:41.537
UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:43.806
IN IN SOME OF THE VERY PLACES

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:45.541
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOCIAL

02:59:45.608 --> 02:59:47.643
JUSTICE ISSUES WHICH WE SHOULD

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:51.347
BE. AYE NOISES ALSO. SOMETHING

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:52.314
THAT YOU KNOW SUBURBAN

02:59:52.381 --> 02:59:54.283
COMMUNITIES JUST ON THE NATURAL

02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:56.285
QUIETER. AND I THINK WE'RE

02:59:56.352 --> 02:59:57.853
TRYING TO HELP THOSE URBAN

02:59:57.920 --> 02:59:59.588
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING

02:59:59.655 --> 03:00:00.689
FROM NOISE POLLUTION SO THAT'S

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:03.092
PART OF WHY WE'RE DOING THIS-

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:04.326
FOR THE SOCIAL INEQUITY JUST ON

03:00:04.393 --> 03:00:05.728
THE NOISE POLLUTION ISSUE. AS

03:00:05.794 --> 03:00:10.766
FAR AS THE CITATION THE FIRST-

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:13.102
TIME IT CAPTURES YOU IT'S A

03:00:13.169 --> 03:00:15.804
WARNING. SO THERE IS NO CITATION

03:00:15.871 --> 03:00:17.506
THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENS AND

03:00:17.573 --> 03:00:19.608
SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT FOLKS

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:20.576
HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD AS WELL

03:00:20.643 --> 03:00:22.211
WHAT HAPPENS IF A MISTAKE YOU

03:00:22.278 --> 03:00:24.246
KNOW SOMEBODY'S PARKED AT THAT

03:00:24.313 --> 03:00:25.881
INTERSECTION NEXT TO THE PERSON

03:00:25.948 --> 03:00:27.983
WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE LEGAL SO

03:00:28.050 --> 03:00:30.252
THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT PERSON

03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:32.688
WOULD BE CAPTUREDA SECOND TIME.

03:00:32.755 --> 03:00:34.857
WHO IS INNOCENT IS NEARLY

03:00:34.924 --> 03:00:36.158
IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE SAME

03:00:36.225 --> 03:00:37.626
CIRCUMVENT THEY BE AT THE SAME

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:38.961
INTERSECTION NEXT TO THE SAME

03:00:39.028 --> 03:00:41.363
PERSON WHO WAS ACTUALLY CAUSING

03:00:41.430 --> 03:00:43.832
THE NOISE PROBLEM SO WE'RE NOT

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:45.467
GOING TO CAPTURE THAT INNOCENT

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:48.637
PERSON OR THE THIRD OF THE A

03:00:48.704 --> 03:00:50.306
RONI IS BYSTANDER WHO GETS. THAT

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:51.507
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET THEM A

03:00:51.574 --> 03:00:52.541
SECOND I'M JUST A TYPICALLY

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:54.710
THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.078
FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS.

03:00:56.145 --> 03:00:58.147
ILLEGALLY MODIFIED MUFFLER WHO

03:00:58.214 --> 03:00:59.949
IS CAUSING THE NOISE POLLUTION

03:01:00.015 --> 03:01:01.517
WE'RE GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

03:01:01.584 --> 03:01:03.319
TO CURE THAT. WE'RE GIVING THEM

03:01:03.385 --> 03:01:04.620
WE'RE ACTUALLY EVEN LOOKING AT A

03:01:04.687 --> 03:01:07.256
AT A AT A AT A MONETARY WAY TO

03:01:07.323 --> 03:01:09.191
TRY TO FINANCE THAT- BUT IF

03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:11.393
YOU'RE A HABITUAL. PERSON WHO

03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:13.762
WHO MIGHT ILLEGALLY MODIFIED

03:01:13.829 --> 03:01:16.532
YOUR CAR TO. YOU KNOW EXCEED THE

03:01:16.599 --> 03:01:18.200
DECIBEL LEVEL IN YOUR CONTINUE

03:01:18.267 --> 03:01:20.869
TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE YOU

03:01:20.936 --> 03:01:22.905
KEEP GETTING CAUGHT- YOU KNOW

03:01:22.972 --> 03:01:24.306
THAT'S THE PERSON WE'RE GOING

03:01:24.373 --> 03:01:26.408
AFTER SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT AS

03:01:26.475 --> 03:01:28.277
MANY GUARD RAILS AROUND. THE

03:01:28.344 --> 03:01:29.645
INNOCENT BYSTANDER AND THE

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:32.248
PERSON. THAT I ANALYZE I SAID

03:01:32.314 --> 03:01:34.116
WE'RE EVEN LOOKING AT SOME

03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:35.517
FINANCIAL. FINANCIAL HELP SO

03:01:35.584 --> 03:01:37.453
WE'RE TAKING ALL THOSE COMMENTS

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:38.921
TO HEART AND WE'RE TRYING AND AS

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:42.191
FAR AS- TESTING IT IS A NARAL

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:44.059
PILOT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX

03:01:44.126 --> 03:01:45.594
CITIES. OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:47.429
NINETY FIVE IN THE STATE OF

03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:48.297
CALIFORNIA AND THOSE CITIES

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:50.065
WOULD HAVE TO OPT IN AS WELL.

03:01:50.132 --> 03:01:52.334
AND THE BILL HAS BUILT IN PUBLIC

03:01:52.401 --> 03:01:54.103
PARTICIPATION BEFORE SHE CAN

03:01:54.169 --> 03:01:57.039
EVEN ENACT. THE POLICY THEY HAVE

03:01:57.106 --> 03:01:58.774
TO GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PUBLIC

03:01:58.841 --> 03:02:00.276
PARTICIPATION DISCUSSION. LET'S

03:02:00.342 --> 03:02:02.244
SAY THERE'S A COMMUNITY OVW'S

03:02:02.311 --> 03:02:04.179
LONG BEACH SINCE HE WAS BROUGHT

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:05.547
UP IF ONE BEACH WANTS TO DO IT.

03:02:05.614 --> 03:02:07.716
LONG BEACH HAS TO HAVE A ROBUST

03:02:07.783 --> 03:02:10.119
PUBLIC PROCESS BEFORE THEY EVEN

03:02:10.185 --> 03:02:13.322
ENACT. THE POLICY WITH DEFINED.

03:02:13.389 --> 03:02:14.890
WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING AND

03:02:14.957 --> 03:02:16.692
ENFORCING IT AND WITH THE GUARD

03:02:16.759 --> 03:02:18.661
RAILS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WHICH

03:02:18.727 --> 03:02:20.896
AS AS BOB MENTIONED WE'RE NOT

03:02:20.963 --> 03:02:21.630
TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING

03:02:21.697 --> 03:02:23.866
ENFORCED BY THE POLICE FORCE BY

03:02:23.932 --> 03:02:27.836
IT'S GOING TO BE. YOU. KNOW DONE

03:02:27.903 --> 03:02:30.105
BY THAT. PASSED BY OF A CITY NOT

03:02:30.172 --> 03:02:31.607
THE LAWN. EFFORTS THE SELF. YOU

03:02:31.674 --> 03:02:33.375
KNOW I THINK MAKING SURE THAT

03:02:33.442 --> 03:02:35.644
THE CITY HAS THAT ROBUST PUBLIC.

03:02:35.711 --> 03:02:36.812
DISCOURSE BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTED

03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:38.380
WHERE ACTIVISTS CAN COME FORWARD

03:02:38.447 --> 03:02:40.082
AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT HERE'S WHO

03:02:40.149 --> 03:02:42.184
WE LIKE IT WE DON'T LIKE OR WE

03:02:42.251 --> 03:02:43.552
DON'T WANT IT. YOU KNOW THAT'S

03:02:43.619 --> 03:02:45.154
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.088
CITY'S NOT MANDATING THAT ANY

03:02:46.155 --> 03:02:47.723
CITY DOES THIS. BUT I SHOULD

03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:50.459
HEAR THERE ARE A BUNCH THERE ARE

03:02:50.526 --> 03:02:52.261
SOME CITIES THAT WANT TO DO IT.

03:02:52.328 --> 03:02:53.629
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DEFINE

03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:54.763
THAT ALTHOUGH SAFEGUARDS WITHIN

03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:56.198
THAT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT

03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:57.333
MAKES IT STRONGER. PARTY THANK

03:02:57.399 --> 03:02:59.601
YOU. BOB THURSTON. THAN CYNICAL

03:02:59.668 --> 03:03:01.870
BO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I

03:03:01.937 --> 03:03:06.875
APPRECIATED THE DIALOGUE SO FOR-

03:03:06.942 --> 03:03:09.078
I THINK IT'S JUST WORTH NOTING

03:03:09.144 --> 03:03:09.978
THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN JUDICIARY

03:03:10.045 --> 03:03:14.116
COMMITTEE- AND THE CREATIVITY.

03:03:14.183 --> 03:03:15.417
OF THE APPROACH YOU'VE TAKEN

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:17.653
HERE I THINK IS LAUDABLE AND

03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:21.090
THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE LAWS ON

03:03:21.156 --> 03:03:22.491
THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

03:03:22.558 --> 03:03:23.759
BASICALLY BEING COMPLETELY

03:03:23.826 --> 03:03:27.463
IGNORED. AND WE WENT THROUGH A

03:03:27.529 --> 03:03:29.732
VERY TOUGH PROCESS TO GET THOSE

03:03:29.798 --> 03:03:32.234
BILLS PASSED I WORKED ON. THE

03:03:32.301 --> 03:03:35.204
BILL THAT IT INSTITUTED- SOME

03:03:35.270 --> 03:03:38.240
EXHAUST SYSTEM IN SOUND. A SOUND

03:03:38.307 --> 03:03:39.842
REQUIREMENTS ON MOTORCYCLES AND-

03:03:39.908 --> 03:03:41.910
CONSIDER PADLEY KERRY THAT

03:03:41.977 --> 03:03:44.380
LEGISLATION THAT WAS. I WAS

03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:48.150
SCARY THERE WERE THREATS- YOU

03:03:48.217 --> 03:03:51.053
KNOW SHE HAD TO BE. PROTECTED BY

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:52.187
CHP DURING THE PASSAGE OF THAT

03:03:52.254 --> 03:03:55.057
BILL WHO CAME TO OUR OFFICE HER

03:03:55.124 --> 03:03:59.862
HOME- WE DID WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:01.864
THAT THE HEAVY LIFT ON PUTTING.

03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:03.766
THESE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOOKS

03:04:03.832 --> 03:04:05.601
IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND YET.

03:04:05.667 --> 03:04:07.035
THEY'RE BASICALLY BEING IGNORED

03:04:07.102 --> 03:04:10.706
AND THE QUESTION IN MY MIND IS

03:04:10.773 --> 03:04:13.675
WHETHER WE DIVERT. PUBLIC SAFETY

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:16.478
RESOURCES TO TRYING TO MAKE THAT

03:04:16.545 --> 03:04:18.981
LETTER OF THE LAW MATTER- AWAY

03:04:19.047 --> 03:04:20.949
FROM SAY VIOLENT CRIME OR OTHER

03:04:21.016 --> 03:04:22.017
ISSUES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

03:04:22.084 --> 03:04:24.353
DEALING WITH AND DOWN TO VEHICLE

03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:26.422
CODE VIOLATION OR WHETHER WE

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:27.856
TAKE SOME OTHER APPROACH I

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:29.224
APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THE

03:04:29.291 --> 03:04:31.994
AUTHORS MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:33.362
THERE'S THAT SORT OF ROBUST

03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:34.296
PUBLIC PROCESS AND THEN ALSO.

03:04:34.363 --> 03:04:36.231
THE CURE RATE I MEAN SO THAT

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:37.533
THEY WERE NOT UNDER CUTTING

03:04:37.599 --> 03:04:39.201
ANYBODY'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS

03:04:39.268 --> 03:04:39.701
HEARING THAT WE'RE WE'RE

03:04:39.768 --> 03:04:41.370
ENSURING THAT- THERE'S AN

03:04:41.437 --> 03:04:42.971
ABILITY TO CHALLENGE ANY ANY

03:04:43.038 --> 03:04:46.775
SORT OF YOUR RONI IS- THE RONI'S

03:04:46.842 --> 03:04:50.579
VIOLATION. BUT TO ME THIS IS.

03:04:50.646 --> 03:04:52.648
IT'S FISCALLY IMPORTANT POLICY

03:04:52.714 --> 03:04:54.516
BUT ALSO AS A MATTER OF SORT OF.

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:56.852
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE NOT TO HAVE

03:04:56.919 --> 03:04:59.955
THIS BE JUST ON LAW ENFORCEMENT-

03:05:00.022 --> 03:05:01.990
TO HANDLE THIS- AND IN MANY

03:05:02.057 --> 03:05:03.926
CASES THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT LAW

03:05:03.992 --> 03:05:05.427
ENFORCEMENT. DON'T HAVE THE

03:05:05.494 --> 03:05:07.196
CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY TO DEAL

03:05:07.262 --> 03:05:11.300
WITH- SO I I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED

03:05:11.366 --> 03:05:12.801
ON TO THE MEASURE THE

03:05:12.868 --> 03:05:13.402
APPROPRIATE TIME AND I WOULD

03:05:13.469 --> 03:05:15.437
MOVE THE BILL- IF IT HASN'T BEEN

03:05:15.504 --> 03:05:17.206
MOVED ALREADY. BUT I KNOW YOU

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:18.774
KEEP WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:20.642
