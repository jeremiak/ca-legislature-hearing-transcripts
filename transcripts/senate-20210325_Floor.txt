REGULATORY RESIDENTS AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE RESOLUTION SIXTEEN COMMEMORATING THE TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE. GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY IS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY CELEBRATED ANNUALLY IN GREECE ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH COMMEMORATING THE START OF THE WAR OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE. FOR ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS GREECE WAS UNDER THE REIGN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. ORTHODOX GREEKS WERE GRANTED FEW RIGHTS AS SUBJECTS UNDER OTTOMAN RULE. THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEK SOCIETY AND THE RESURGENCE OF GREEK PATRIOTISM. THE GREEK REVOLT BEGAN ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE WHEN BISHOP THURMOND ALSO ABOUT THAT US RAISE THE FLAG OF REVOLUTION OVER THE MONASTERY OF ALL YOUR LOVE IT ON IN THE PELOPONNESE. JUST AS THE REVOLUTION APPEARED TO BE ON THE VERGE OF FAILURE. GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND RUSSIA INTERVENED IN THE CONFLICT. THE GREEK STRUGGLE HAD ELICITED STRONG SYMPATHY IN EUROPE INCLUDING INTELLECTUALS AND ARTISTS SUCH AS THE ENGLISH POET LORD BYRON. THE REVOLUTION ENDED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE WHEN THE TREATY DETERMINED ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT GREEKS STATE. COLLEAGUES GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY IS MORE THAN JUST ESTABLISHING GREECE AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE. GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ABOUT THE LASTING VALUES A CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HELLENISTIC CULTURE HAS BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA IN LAW MEDICINE EDUCATION SPORTS THE ARTS DEMOCRACY IN ARCHITECTURE. EVEN AS BUILDING DERIVES ITS ROOTS FROM GREEK ARCHITECTURE. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE A GREEK HERITAGE IN FACT THE GREEK WORD EUREKA OR GREEK I'VE FOUND HAS BEEN THE MODEL ON OUR STATE SEAL SINCE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE. REPORTER HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED MY LIFE MY FAMILY MY WIFE'S FAMILY ARE BOTH FROM GREECE I GREW UP IN A TRADITIONAL GREEK AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD I WAS A FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR IN GREECE AND WORKED. AT A THINK TANK IN ATHENS. THE CONSUL GENERAL OF SAN FRANCISCO EVEN ADMINISTER MY OATH FOR DOCTORAL STATUS. AS GREECE IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO STAND TOGETHER AS FRIENDS AND ALLIES LET US RECOGNIZE OUR SHARED LOVE FOR FREEDOM LIBERTY AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. WHEN THE ISLAND OF CRETE WAS INVADED BY ONE. AND GREEK DEMOCRACY WAS THREATENED ONCE AGAIN. GREEK CIVILIANS DEMONSTRATE THE RESOLVE AND STRENGTH BY DOING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE FAMOUSLY SAID. WE WILL NOT SAY THAT GREEKS FOUGHT LIKE HEROES. INSTEAD BUT THAT HEROES FIGHT LIKE GREEKS. COLLEAGUES DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA IS IN PERIL. LET US LOOK TO THE LESSONS AND LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE GREEKS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN OUR INCREASINGLY CHALLENGED NATION. WE TOO MUST DEFEND THE VALUES OF OUR GREAT DEMOCRACY AGAINST ENEMIES BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. LET THIS RESOLUTION BE A GESTURE TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS GREECE HAS GIVEN OR GOLDEN STATE. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU.

GROWING UP MEXICAN AMERICAN WE OFTEN DON'T GET TO LEARN MUCH ABOUT HISTORIC FIGURES THAT LOOK LIKE US THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE LEGACY OF SENSE OF TRAVIS. I THOUGHT I KNEW FIRSTHAND THE STRUGGLES OF THE NATION'S POOREST AND MOST POWERLESS WORKERS WHO LABOR TO PUT FOOD ON OUR NATION'S TABLES WERE OFTEN GOING HUNGRY THEMSELVES.

TODAY FARMWORKERS CONTINUE TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLES AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT PANDEMIC. THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT WE ENJOY IN OUR DAILY LIVES ARE PRODUCED BY FARMWORKERS WHO OFTEN INJURED AND LONG HOURS OF BREAK BACK BACKBREAKING WORK.

AS RELATIVELY NEW IMMIGRANTS JEWISH TRADE WORKERS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE RISE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. JEWISH LABOUR ACTIVISTS SAMUEL GOMPERS WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE AFL- RUNNING THE UNION FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED HEBREW TRADES. BOTH ITS POWER TELLING ONE HUNDRED AND SIX JEWISH UNIONS UNDER ITS UMBRELLA. I JUST WANTED TO CHAVEZ STARTED TO ORGANIZE TO FIGHT OPPRESSION OF LARGELY LATINO- AND ALSO FILIPINO FARMWORKERS. MANY JEWISH LEADERS ROSE TO ITS SIDE IN SOLIDARITY SEVERAL ORTHODOX RABBIS URGE THEIR CONGREGATIONS NOT TO BUY A NON UNION GRADES DECLARING THEM OSHA- MEETING UNCLEAN BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM EXPLOITED LABOR. RABBI JOSEPH GLAZER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL CONFERENCE OF AMERICAN RABBIS SAID QUOTE UNTIL THE PEOPLE WHO STOOP AND SQUAT. AND GO THROUGH ALL KINDS OF HELL OUT THERE IN THE FIELDS ARE TREATED RIGHT. THOSE GRADES ARE TRAFFORD TRADE. MEETING NOT KOSHER. TRAGICALLY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MAN FREEMAN WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO LOSE HER LIFE. ON A FARM WORKER PICKET LINE SHE WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT FROM BOSTON WHO TRAVEL TO FLORIDA. TO JOIN A STRIKE AGAINST TALISMAN SUGAR COMPANY. I WAS KILLED BY A TRUCK CRASH IN THE PICKET LINE. CHAVEZ'S WIFE HELEN ONE SHARE THIS STORY FROM WHEN THEIR UNION WAS GAINING MOMENTUM.

THE THIRD CHAVEZ LIFE SERVES AS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF HOW ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN IMPACT GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE. THE FORGE NATIONAL COALITIONS OF UNIONS CHURCH GROUPS STUDENTS MINORITIES AND CONSUMERS THE STAND WITH FARMWORKERS THROUGH THE POWERFUL USE OF NONVIOLENCE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE MOST. BALL NOBLE AND VALUABLE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE FARMWORKERS ONE RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. TODAY THE ROLE OF FARMWORKERS IS JUST AS VITAL TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S IT WAS ONE SINCE I BEGAN HIS STRUGGLE. OUR FARMWORKERS CONTINUE TO FEED OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. SINCE I USED TO SAY IT'S IRONIC THAT THOSE WHO TOIL THE SOIL CULTIVATE AND HARVEST THE FRUITS VEGETABLES AND OTHER FOODS THAT FILL YOUR TABLES WITH ABUNDANCE. HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR THEMSELVES. I PERSONALLY KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT. I GREW UP WORKING IN THE FIELDS OF MY PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I PICKED GRAPES AND COTTON PEACHES OLIVES AND MUCH MORE. WE WORKED FROM SUN UP TO SUN DOWN AND MANY TIMES WE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO EAT AND PUT A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS FOOD PITCH THE TENT OR SLEPT IN THE BACK OF OUR FLATBED TRUCK. MY LATE HUSBAND MIGUEL AND HIS FAMILY AND I KNEW BUT JOIN THE FARMWORKERS MOMENT. THEY WENT ON STRIKE. AND ENDED UP GETTING EVICTED FROM THE SHACK ON THE GROWERS PROPERTY. CESA CHAVEZ INSPIRED ME TO DEDICATE MY LIFE. TO EMPOWER PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR OWN LIVES THAT'S WHY FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I'VE BEEN AN ORGANIZER GARMENT WORKERS HOTEL WORKERS IMMIGRANT WORKERS WORKING PEOPLE. SAYS THAT INSPIRED AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG AND OLD TO BE ACTIVISTS HE ADVOCATED FOR A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AND LGBT Q. RIGHTS LONG BEFORE IT WAS ACCEPTABLE. HE CONNECTED WITH DR KING AS COMMITTED PRACTITIONERS OF NONVIOLENT TOOLS LIKE STRIKES BOYCOTTS AND MARCHES. IN FACT TO DISLIKE THE MOST EXPLOITED BLACK SANITATION WORKERS BECAME THE CAUSE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS SO FARMWORKERS BECAME THE CAUSE FOR LATINOS. I HAD THE FORTUNE TO MEET AND TALK WITH ASAD SEVERAL TIMES BUT I REMEMBER ONCE WAS WHAT ARE. THE MOST. MEMORABLE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE ALLEN I VISITED WOULD SET ASIDE AFTER DAYS INTO HIS LAST FAST OF THIRTY SIX DAYS TO PROTEST PESTICIDES. HE HAD REALLY STARTED TO FEEL THE HUNGER PAINS. AND SAID THAT HE HAD HAD A VERY STRANGE DREAM. WE ASKED WILL WHAT WAS THAT. AND HE SAID THAT HE DREAMED OF EATING TACOS THE CARD NOW SAW THEM. NO OF COURSE HE CHUCKLED. BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A DEVOTED VEGAN. IF WE WANT TO HONOR SAYS ARE CHAVEZ LET'S HONOR THE SACRIFICES FARMWORKERS MAKE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IF WE WANT TO HONOR SAYS OUR JOB IS LET'S USE OUR POWERS LEGISLATORS. TO MAKE SURE FARMWORKERS AND ALL MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ARE TO DO WITH DIGNITY'S. GOOD GOOD WAGES HEALTH CARE SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND REAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. FINALLY THE LATINO CAUCUSES PRODUCES KEPT COMMEMORATIVE CARD AND FACE MASK WITH THE UFW EAGLE. THE SYMBOL OF THE RESILIENCY OF THE FARMWORKER LABOR MOVEMENT. SOCIAL JUSTICE AND UMAN RIGHTS.
