01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:30.887
FLOW AND CIRCULATION THAT

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:31.487
SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE

VISITOR CENTER FROM THE TIME

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.390
THEY COME INTO THE BUILDING. TO

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.526
HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH THE SPACE

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.194
HOW THEY GO THROUGH SECURITY

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.695
HOW THEY MOVE INTO THE EXHIBIT

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.030
AREAS AND HOW THEY MOVE FROM

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.366
THE EXHIBIT AREAS. EITHER INTO

AND THEN INTO THE REST OF THE

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.976
FACILITY. WE HAVE THEN TRIED TO

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.778
DIAGRAM THAT IN A GRAPHIC

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.613

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.451
PEOPLE COME INTO THE WELCOMING.

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.119
AND ASSEMBLY AREA THEY WOULD

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.854
ASSEMBLE THERE AND THEN MOVE

CAN BE PROVIDED TO THEM RATHER

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.438
THAN HAVING THEM STAND OUTSIDE

IN THE RAIN. WITH UMBRELLAS

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:26.209

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROCESS

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.317
BY WHICH WE BELIEVE. THE

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.785
EXHIBIT DESIGNERS WILL MOVE

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.386
THROUGH AND IT IS BEEN ALIGNED

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.288
WITH THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.723
THE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILDERS

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:42.825
WILL USE. AS THEY PUT TOGETHER

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.227
THE BUILDING AND SO WE HAVE

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.728
TALKED ABOUT. IN THE PROJECT

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.196
DEFINITION WHICH IS USUALLY THE

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.631
FIRST PHASE THAT THE DESIGNERS

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.366
WILL GO THROUGH. THEY WILL BE

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.400

ARE THE MESSAGES WE WANT TO

01:02:57.773 --> 01:03:00.209
SEND. SCHEMATIC DESIGN THE

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.711
VISITOR CENTER WILL FOCUS ON

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.580
THEMING AND STORY LINE. WITHIN

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.015
THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.850
PROJECT THEY WILL LOOK AT THE

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:08.918

IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.910

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:30.306
READY TO GO WITH THE

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.875
PROCUREMENT. AS PART OF THE

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.210
WORK ON THE ANNEX WE HAVE

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.446
SPENT. A LOT OF TIME. LOOKING

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:38.881
AT THE WORK THAT WAS DONE

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.850
PREVIOUSLY BY THE ARCHITECTURAL

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.251
FIRM THAT DEVELOPED THE BLUE

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:44.053
BOOK. THEY PROVIDED US WITH

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.754
WHAT'S CALLED A SPACE PROGRAM

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.490
WHICH BASICALLY LAYS OUT THE

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:48.858
AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.960
EACH OFFICER OR FACILITY OR

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.528
FUNCTION WITHIN THE BUILDING

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.196
WILL. WILL HAVE WE'VE GONE BACK

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:57.199
THROUGH THAT ANALYZE THAT WE

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.567
ARE LOOKING AT A FACILITY FOR

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.569
THE ANNEX OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.037
AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.073
FEET. VISITORS CENTER IS

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:06.275
APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:09.078
SQUARE FEET AND WE'RE LOOKING

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:09.678
AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKING

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:13.549
STALLS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:14.183
ARE LOOKING AT DOING A BUILDING

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.017
THAT IS. SUSTAINABLE WE ARE

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:15.818
LOOKING AT LEAD RE USE OF

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.286
EXISTING MATERIALS THAT ARE

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.221
WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND WE

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.090
WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.858
WOOD THAT HAS BEEN HARVESTED OR

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.827
WHEN IT FELL. DURING A STORM WE

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.896
HAVE HOLD HELD ON TO THAT AND

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.063
SO WE HAVE USED THE WORD FROM

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:31.200
THE CIVIL WAR TREES. WE WANT TO

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:32.501
MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS ABLE TO

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:35.437
BE USED IN. AND PRESENTED

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:37.072
WITHIN THE BUILDING. WE'RE

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.241
LOOKING AT NET ZERO ENERGY WE'D

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.643
LIKE TO MOVE TOWARDS A LOW

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.444
CARBON AND ELECTRIFICATION OF

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.547
BUILDINGS. INCLUDING DAYLIGHT

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.714
HARVESTING NATURAL LIGHTING

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:48.150
VIEWS AND WHERE WE CAN WE WOULD

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:50.653
LIKE TO USE GRAY WATER WE USE.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.221
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BUILDING

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.390
SHOULD BE AS MR COOLEY SAYS ONE

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:55.658
OF THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.427
CAPITOL. BUILDINGS IN THE

01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:58.928
NATION AND WE'RE WORKING

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.764
TOWARDS THAT GOAL. ONE OF THE

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:04.533
THINGS THAT WE ARE STUDYING AND

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.001
WILL BE WORKING ON OVER THE

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:07.102
NEXT LITTLE BIT IS. WHAT

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.404
FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE CURRENT

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.573
ANNEX NEED TO MOVE INTO THE

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:13.208
WEST WING AS WE- VACATE THE

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.677
ADDICTS AND MOVED IN TO THE

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:17.046
TENTH AND SWING SPACE. THAT WAY

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:20.282
WE CAN KEEP THE- LEGISLATURE IN

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.017
YOUR FUNCTIONS GOING WITHIN THE

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.752
WEST WING WHILE YOU ARE LIVING

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:26.689
IN THE TEMPORAL BUILDING. SO WE

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.756
ARE IDENTIFYING THOSE THINGS

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.024
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:30.659
SPACE FOR THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:31.994
MAKE SPACE OR MAKE SURE THAT

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.295
LEADERSHIP IS STILL AVAILABLE

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.463
TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.531
NEED TO DO WITH IN THE WEST

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.766
WING AS WELL SO. IT'S KIND OF A

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.669
COMPLICATED. GAME OF. MOVING

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.271
PIECES AROUND BUT I THINK

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.039
THAT'S COMING TOGETHER IF I MAY

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.574
JUST JUMP IN ON THE SLIDE SO

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:48.310
THE- THE BOTTOM LINE IS. OUR

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.379
CHAMBERS. ARE CURRENTLY

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:53.482
SUPPORTED BY TURKS OFFICES

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.817
SERGEANTS OFFICES AND **** IN

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:57.519
SPACES. ALL OF WHICH ARE IN THE

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.055
ANNEX PORTION. OF THE BUILDING.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.424
SO THIS CHART IS ACTUALLY

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:05.961
DEPICTING THIS IDEA. THAT WHILE

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:06.762
SPACE WILL BE RETAINED IN THE

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:07.830
LEADERSHIP SWEETS RIGHT OFF THE

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:08.897
CHAMBERS. ON THE OUTER WALL OF

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.734
THE BUILDING NORTH AND SOUTH.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.935
CENTRAL PORTIONS WILL BE

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:15.704
REPURPOSE PROVIDE COXON SPACES

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:16.205
ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:19.775
CHAMBERS. SO THAT IF WE'RE IN

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.176
SESSION WE'RE GOOD IF WE NEED

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:23.812
TO RETREAT TO CAUCUSES OF THE

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.314
SPACE PROVIDED CONVENE IT TO

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.250
THE FLOOR. AND SO THAT'S PART

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.284
OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.120
HISTORIC CAPITAL REMAINS THE

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.055
WORKING CAPITAL NOT A MUSEUM

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.758
OUR SESSIONS WILL CONTINUE AND

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.159
SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.227
THIS IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.329
IMPORTANT SLIDE IN TERMS OF

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.598
JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WILL

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:44.199
MAKE THE BUILDING WORK. AND

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:45.300
THESE WERE REPRESENT. TEMPORARY

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:48.270
CHAMBERS BUT ON THE

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.972
CONSTITUTION THEY ARE REQUIRED

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:50.706
TO HAVE A SEPARATE

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.274
APPROPRIATION PAY FOR THEM SO

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.543
THAT'S WHAT TIME FOR WINE WAS

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:55.911
REVIEWING SEEN ADDED TWENTY

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.579
MILLION APPROPRIATION UNDER

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.815
THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT WAS

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:00.716
MADE IN THE CONSCIOUS FOR PRO

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.551
REQUISITES FOR TOUCHING THE

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.053
WEST WING A BROWN TEMPORARY

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.955
BASIS AND AS YOU COME TO WE'RE

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.123
GOING TO TURN A HOLLY MITCHELL

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.591
IN A MINUTE FOR THE FIRST

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.393
QUESTIONS BUT PLEASE CALL CAN

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.661

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.963
GOING TO STATE SHE'S UP FIRST

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.864
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:20.169
CHAIR. SO MOVING ON THE THIS IS

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.971
A GRAPHIC THAT DEMONSTRATES

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.373
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.174
TRYING TO DO IS ALIGN THE

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.744
FLOORS AS YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.946
SO MANY YEARS SINCE NINETEEN

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:31.547
FIFTY TWO IN THE BUILDING WAS

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.482
BUILT THERE WAS NO ALIGNMENT OF

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.551
THE FLOORS REALLY TO SPEAK OF

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:36.919
SO ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO ALIGN

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:39.054
THE FLOORS AND YOU CAN SEE THE

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.256
APPROXIMATE MASS THAT WE'RE

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.158
DEALING WITH WE'RE GONNA BE

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:47.996
LOOKING. AT WAYS TO REDUCE THAT

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:51.934
MASS. AND TRY TO STE. ALL OF

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.935
THE- ASPECTS. WE HAVE GONE

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.036
THROUGH AND TRIED TO DO A VERY

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:54.870
DETAILED STUDY OF THE BUDGET AS

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:55.604
BEST WE CAN AT THIS POINT IN

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:56.839
TIME TRYING TO ESTIMATOR

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.941
GUESSTIMATE. THOSE THINGS THAT

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.576
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCOUNT

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:04.646
FOR. AND TRY TO FUND. I'M HAPPY

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:07.416
TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE A BUDGET

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.818
MODEL THAT IS IN BUDGET AND

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:10.385
WE'RE I THINK WE'RE ABLE TO

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.387
MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AND

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.689
THEN WITH REGARDS TO SCHEDULE

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.023
WE HAVE BUILT A SCHEDULE THAT

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:16.358
WE ARE USING TO GUIDE OUR

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.761
DIRECTION. WITH REGARDS TO HOW

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.496
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND AT

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.964
THIS POINT IN TIME WITH REGARDS

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.532
TO THAT WE ARE SITTING ON

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.801
SCHEDULE. AS WE'RE MOVING

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.971
FORWARD. AND SO WITH THAT I

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:29.538
WILL BE HAPPY TO. ENTERTAIN

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:33.609
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.319
STATEMENT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:45.687
THE CONCERT WITH THE VISITOR

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.022
CENTER AS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.091
MEMBER TO NCSL I'VE HAD THE

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.592
OPPORTUNITY IN RECENT YEARS TO

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.161
TRAVEL TO A NUMBER OF OUR STATE

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:53.262
CAPITALS IN A NUMBER OF THEM

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.330
THAT HAVE DONE. HAD RESET

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:56.465
CERTAINLY MORE RECENT THAN OURS

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:58.567
CONSTRUCTION HAVE THESE VISITOR

01:13:58.634 --> 01:13:59.501
CENTERS AND THEY'RE JUST

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.403
WONDERFUL MODELS TO SEE SO I

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.739
THINK THAT WILL BUILD VERY WELL

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:04.973
FOR OUR STATE NOW AS MR

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.775

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.179
CHALLENGE BEFORE US TO BUILD

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.347
AND CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCT

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.382
AND IMAGINE SOMETHING FOR THE

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:16.985
FUTURE I THINK THAT SPACE.

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:17.519
MAKES SENSE SINCE I'M VERY

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:19.888
EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ON TO MY

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.156

BUT IT DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:26.995
PROCUREMENT. AND GIVEN THE

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:31.700

SIGNIFICANCE THE HISTORICAL

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:39.842
SIGNIFICANCE. I AM HOPING THAT

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.476
IN OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:42.778
WE'RE LOOKING AT. CALIFORNIA

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:45.447
BASED FIRMS. GIVEN THE FACT

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:46.748
THAT IT'S THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.250
CAPITOL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.418
AND I'M ALSO HOPING THAT

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:50.619
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME TARGETED

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.388

THE OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY THE

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:00.762
SERVICE PRINCIPLES AND NOT JUST

US UP. AND SO IF THERE'S BEEN

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.534
TARGET OUT REACH AND IF WE'RE

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.702
LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA BASED

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.242
PROCUREMENT SO FAR IS THE

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.310
CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER. THEY

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.044
BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.647
OFFICE BASED IN CALIFORNIA WAS

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:19.248
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A THEY

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:21.283
MUST HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.985
AND THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.320
A OFFICE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:28.090
THE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:31.526
ARE CALIFORNIA FIRM STATUS WILL

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:34.796
THAT IS. OFFICE OKAY. THE ISSUE

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:35.697
OF MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.099
ENTERPRISES IS COMPLICATED.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.367
BECAUSE JUST YOU UNDERSTAND

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:43.272
PROP TWO OH NINE PROHIBITS.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.641
PROCUREMENT THAT ARE TARGETED

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.475
TOWARD THEM IT DOESN'T FOR CARE

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.644
PROHIBITS OUT OF REACH ON A

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.012
DOZEN PROHIBITS TARGETED OUT

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:51.213
REACH WHEN I THINK TARGETED OUT

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.981
REACH I MEAN IT EIGHT A

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:56.151
PROACTIVE EFFORT TO FIND AND

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.986
IDENTIFY SO WHAT WE ARE DOING

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.021
WE HAVE A COUPLE THINGS GOING

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.689
ON WORK WE'RE DEFINITELY

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:01.390
LOOKING AT SMALL BUSINESS

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.525
ENTERPRISES AND DISABLED THAT.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.260
AND USING SOME OF THE FORMS

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.862
HOPEFULLY THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.297
WITH DTS BUT USING SOME OF

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:11.400
THEIR OUTRAGE MECHANISMS AND MY

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.001
GET HOPE WOULD BE THAT WITHIN

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:13.969
THOSE WE WOULD GET TO THOSE

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:15.971
COMMUNITIES AND THAT THE

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.105
OUTREACH EFFORTS THEY HAVE

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:21.310
MIGHT HAVE. MINORITY AND WOMEN

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:24.713
OWNED ENTERPRISES. SO THAT'S

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.514
THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE WOULD BE

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.950
DOING WITH RESPECT TO THOSE

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:29.718
THAT REJECT BIRDS. AND AGAIN I

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.620
JUST BUT I GUESS MY POINT BEING

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.288
GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:34.957
INVESTMENT. AND THE HISTORICAL

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.726
RELEVANCE HISTORIC RELEVANCE OF

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:40.262
BUILDING A NEW STATE CAPITOL

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.530
BUT I HOPE THAT WE WOULD REALLY

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:45.133
TRY TO COMPLY WITH. THE SPIRIT

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.001
OF THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:46.702
IN TERMS OF OUR PUBLIC

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.404
INVESTMENT. AND SO IF THERE ARE

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.440
WAYS THAT WE CAN CONNECT WITH

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:52.808
NOVEL ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.310
TO. BREAKING THESE

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.913
OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUR ATTENTION

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.248

CONFINES OF PROP TWO OH NINE

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.287
AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IT

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.022
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:09.191
PRIORITIZE OR GIVE RIGHT

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:11.526

MINORITY EARN. MINORITY OWNED

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.370
FIRMS I THINK IT CAN BE DONE

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:22.504
EVEN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.506

THE AREA HERE IS ABOUT THREE

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:44.859
AND A HALF BEFORE WE TALK. SO

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.327
THAT WE REPLACE WAS SO SCARED

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.162
OUT OVER ON THE SIDE WE ARE

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:53.701
LOCATED IN A SCRATCH. WE HAVE

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:54.268
ABOUT ANY DESIGN SMILED AND

01:27:54.335 --> 01:28:00.308
SAID. GLASS ELEVATOR HERE. THE

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:00.875
ELEVATOR HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO

NEED THOSE TIME. SO HE'S WHICH

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:05.546
WOULD TAKE IT DOWN BELOW AND

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.715
THERE WOULD BE FOR THE GRASSES

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:12.020
TO ENSURE SKYLIGHT. WHICH IS I

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.354
THINK ONE OF THE IMAGES OF YOU.

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.089
LOOK EXHAUSTED THE BILL ALSO

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:20.461
BRING IN NATURAL LIGHT. TO THE

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:23.131
LIKE THAT ARE. THE REST OF THE

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:23.631
SPACE WOULD BE JUST AS A

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:27.168
PRESENT. ONE THOUGHT WE HAVE

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:28.336
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS YOU

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:29.404
CURRENTLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.272
TERRACE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.407
TERRACE HERE WE THOUGHT ABOUT

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:34.175
REINFORCING THAT. AND POSSIBLY

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:35.977
READING IS LIGHT INTO THE LOWER

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:38.379
LEVEL THROUGH A LITTLE STRONGER

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:39.914
TERRACE WITH WHAT HAPPENED AT

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:45.820
THE BASE. WOULD NOT BE ANY

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:48.289
HIGHER THAN THE FLOOR LEVEL.

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:52.093
TAKE YOUR THE SECOND QUESTION.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:52.794
IN OUR OFFICES SENATOR BATES

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.227

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:56.164
SUPERVISORS WE HAD A BAXTER

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:56.798
THAT WE COULD EXIT THE BUILDING

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:57.598
FROM AND WE HAD A SEPARATE

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:58.566
ELEVATOR THAT WE CAN ONLY

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.600
ACCESS FROM OUR OFFICES SO IF

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.268
THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON IN

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:01.302
THE LOBBY OR IN THE HALLWAYS

AND YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:12.313
IT. BUT IT. I'M JUST CURIOUS IN

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.514
THE DESIGN WILL THERE BE

AS WELL AS YOUR OFFICES I THINK

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:18.012
BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT A AN

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.747
OFFICE BUILDING. MORE THAN

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.349

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:46.060
VERY SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS I

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.862
WROTE SOME THINGS DOWN AND

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.697
BECAUSE I STEPPED IN LATE MAYBE

CASE I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:59.573

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.841

RALLY CCD AND WE WERE WORKING

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.552

PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.161
WE WERE CREATING A PIPELINE

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:20.995
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.063
VOCATIONAL TRAINING

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:24.765
OPPORTUNITIES EXPANDING ON THAT

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:25.733
IS THE CONVERSATION AROUND

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.336
LOCAL HIRE. AND EVEN THOUGH

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:29.637
THIS IS CONSTRUCTION THAT'S

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:32.206
HAPPENING IN SACRAMENTO IT IS A

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.875
STATE BUILDING AND SO HOW WE

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:37.144
WOULD BE DEFINING LOCAL HIGHER

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:40.247
IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO HAD A

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:44.452
QUESTION KIND OF ABOUT. THE

01:33:44.518 --> 01:33:45.820
FINANCING OF THIS I DON'T KNOW

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.521
IF IT'S THE SAME BUT WHEN I WAS

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:49.557
THAT THE DISTRICT WE ALSO HAD

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:50.658
BOND ISSUANCE FIRMS THAT WERE

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:53.227
RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE SELLING OF

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.128
THE BOND SO THAT WE COULD

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:55.629
FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION AND

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:56.530
DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:58.599
ANY HIGHLIGHTS ON THAT. AND

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:01.235
ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE WAS A

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.803
PROCUREMENT PROCESS A BIDDING

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.606
PROCESS TO FIND THOSE FIRMS AND

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:08.042
HOW WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.745
THAT THERE'S DIVERSEREPRESENTATION. IN IN THAT AREA

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:13.848
AS WELL. IF YOU COULD TALK A

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:14.315
LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.716
EXPECTATION AROUND CHANGE

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:18.119
ORDERS I SEE THAT THE NUMBER IS

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.154
QUITE HIGH EIGHT HUNDRED

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:23.557
MILLION DOLLARS AND SO I ALSO

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:24.959
SEE THAT THERE'S CONTINGENCIES.

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:27.194
WE ARE. IN THE THROES OF

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.163
CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AROUND

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.565
TRADE AND TERRORISTS AND SO

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:32.933
JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.502
WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:36.404
THE STAYING ON BUDGET OR BELOW

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:39.273
BUDGET. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.409
REALITIES OF THE DAY THIS IS A

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:44.311
HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND JUST

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:45.146
WANT TO HAVE A REALISTIC

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.815
UNDERSTANDING OF IF WE WOULD BE

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:48.416
COMING BACK TO THE TABLE. WITH

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:52.286
BUDGETING. AS IT RELATES TO

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:53.654
CONSTRUCTION ALSO THINKING

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.756
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.225
RECYCLING REUSING MATERIALS YOU

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:59.226
KNOW AND IF THAT'S A

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.461
CONVERSATION AS WE'RE TALKING

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.230
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION.

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.698
AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:07.068
VISITORS CENTER I ALSO BEGIN TO

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.469
THINK ABOUT EXCAVATION YOU KNOW

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:12.039
AND I HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE WE

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:14.608
WERE LOOKING TO UPGRADE ONE OF

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:18.712
OUR COLLEGES AND. I'M THE NOSE

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:19.947
TO EVERYONE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.383
THERE WAS A- OIL REFINERY

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.518
UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE BUILDINGS

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.786
AND SO THE COST TO ACTUALLY

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.588
CLEAN ALL OF THEN OUT THROUGH

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:29.523
THE EXCAVATION WAS ALMOST THE

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:32.693
SAME AS THE COST TO. BUILD THE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.929
NEW FACILITY AND SO IF THERE

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:37.131
ANY SORT OF PLAN PRELIMINARY

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:39.600
DATA THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT.

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:42.203
UNEXPECTED THINGS THAT WILL NOW

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:45.206
BE EXPECTED THAT YEAR. THAT

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:46.941
WILL BE UNDERNEATH ALL OF THIS

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.375
AS WE'RE DOING THAT THAT WOULD

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:50.878
BE CURIOUS TO ME TO KNOW

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:52.446
BECAUSE IT'S THOSE THINGS THAT

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:53.948
END UP RAISING THE COST SO I

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:55.483
KNOW THAT THOSE ARE A WHOLE LOT

01:35:55.549 --> 01:35:57.785
OF QUESTIONS AND I'M SORRY FOR

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.987
MY PTSD BUT- SO THEY'RE VERY

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:03.524
IMPORTANT. THANK. HE WANTED TO

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:07.428
THE PRINCE. OKAY SO I CAN

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:08.028
ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH WITH

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:08.963
RESPECT APPRENTICESHIPS UNDER

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:11.198
THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:11.999
THAT I TALK ABOUT MY

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:14.135
PRESENTATION ONE OF THE

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:15.102
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:16.570
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.072
IS TO WORK OUT THE PROJECT

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:20.007
LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COMMUNITY

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:22.343
WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS AND IN OUR

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.844
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS IT'S

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:26.147
CLEAR TO ME AND I THINK THEY

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:26.847
WOULD REITERATE THAT

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.816
APPRENTICESHIPS ARE A BIG PART.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:31.585
OF THOSE AGREEMENTS INTO SURE

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:35.156
THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:35.890
IN IT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.459
ALWAYS ENCOURAGE. THE

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:41.128
CONTRACTORS THAT WE WORK WITH

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:44.198
TO. GO OUT AND SEEK A VARIETY

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:47.468
OF DIFFERENT SUB CONTRACTORS.

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:50.771
TO PROPOSE ON THESE PROJECTS IN

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:53.007
IN AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:53.874
WORK THROUGH THAT THEY'LL

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.610
PROVIDE INDUSTRY DAYS AND OTHER

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.479
TYPES OF THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE

01:36:58.546 --> 01:36:59.547
TO THAT TO CREATE CREATE

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.749
GENERATE INTEREST. IN THOSE

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:02.816
THINGS SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:05.219
DO THAT AND TRY TO. BRING ALL

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:07.021
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT WE

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:09.023
CAN TO THE TABLE SO THAT WE CAN

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:11.725
UTILIZE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:15.329
FAR AS BONDS AGO I'M NOT REALLY

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:16.764
INVOLVED WITH THE BOND SIDE OF

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:18.999
THINGS I THINK HAT. FOR THOSE

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:20.935
QUESTIONS WE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:21.468
TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:23.571
FINANCE AND HOW THOSE ARE. ARE

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:26.907
BEING HANDLED. WITH REGARD TO

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:29.176
CHANGE ORDERS I CAN EITHER WILL

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:32.146
BE CHANGE ORDERS NO SET OF

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:32.713
DRAWINGS BY AN ARCHITECT IS

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.417
PERFECT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.686
THOSE INSURERS WILL PROBABLY BE

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.254
IN THE 567% RANGE WHICH IS

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:43.157
PRETTY STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.925
WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.994
ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS TO TRY

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:48.529
TO GET THOSE DOWN AS LOW AS

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:51.031
POSSIBLE AND I THINK ONE OF THE

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.234
KEYS TO THAT IS UTILIZING

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.836
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK AS

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:56.637
WELL AS A DESIGN BUILD

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.772
PROCUREMENT METHOD. I THINK

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:00.407
THAT WAY WERE ABLE TO

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.810
ANTICIPATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:05.246
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENT REVIEWS

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:07.581
AND CONSTRUCT ABILITY REVIEWS

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.149
BY THE CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.784
THE ARCHITECT WITH INFORMATION

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:11.352
SO THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE THE

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:12.419
DRYING BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:15.756
FINISHED TOO OFTEN THOSE

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.491
DRAWINGS COME OUT WITH ERRORS

01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:20.861
OMISSIONS OR THINGS THAT ARE

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:23.931
NOT COMPLETE LET'S JUST SAY.

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.567
AND BY HAVING A GOOD CONSTRUED

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:27.534
ABILITY REVIEW BY A

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:28.836
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER OR

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:30.771
SOMEBODY WHO IS THEY'RE GOING

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.406
TO BUILD THE BUILDING AND WHO'S

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:35.609
GOING TO GIVE US WHAT'S CALLED

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:36.443
A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE TO

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.678
THE BUILDING BUT WE ARE ABLE TO

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.613
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.417
ORDERS SO WE'VE SEEN I'M PROUD

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:46.620
THAT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN.

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:50.057
FROM UTAH TO MINNESOTA MEANING.

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:54.461
WE'VE BEEN. LARGE COMPLICATED

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:55.629
OBJECTS ON BUDGET BELOW BUDGET

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:56.430
AND SO I FEEL I FEEL VERY

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:57.031
COMFORTABLE WITH THE BUDGET

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:57.598
NUMBER IN THE CONTINGENCIES

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:58.232
THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER NOW AS

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.066
WE GO THROUGH AND WE LEARN MORE

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:01.268
ABOUT THE PROJECT AND WE START

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:03.270
TO SEE DESIGNS COME ABOUT WE

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:04.705
WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUDGETING

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:05.973
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.708
ESTIMATING A SOME OF THAT

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:08.309
CONTINGENCY THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.110
THERE WILL MOVE INTO OTHER

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.979
PORTIONS OF THE PROJECT WE WILL

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.681
ALWAYS CARRY A CONTINGENCY

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:16.984
HOWEVER TO ACCOMMODATE AND MAKE

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:19.320
SURE WE CAN HANDLE. THE CHANGE

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:23.123
ORDERS UP WILL BE A ANTICIPATED.

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:23.624
AND THEN IT FAR AS THE

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:24.224
MATERIALS AND EXCAVATION WE

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.259
HAVE ALREADY STARTED. A

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.261
DIALOGUE WITH SOME OF THE

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.797
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:31.598
WERE FAMILIAR IN THIS AREA. THE

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:34.835
SEQUEL. REPORT HAS IDENTIFIED

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.637
THOSE WE BEGUN CONVERSATIONS

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:39.373
WITH ASSEMBLYMAN ROMMEL'S. WITH

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.075
REGARDS TO HOW WE WANT TO

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.009
PROCEED WE'RE LOOKING AT A

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:44.144
VARIETY OF WAYS OF. TRYING TO

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:45.312
IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE ANY

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:48.916
REMAINS FROM BOTH EXCAVATION AS

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:51.018
WELL AS CADAVER DOGS. WE ARE

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:54.254
ALSO PUTTING IN PLACE PROTOCOL

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.889
AND PROCEDURES TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:57.624
HANDLE THAT AND THEN ON TOP OF

01:39:57.691 --> 01:40:00.561
THAT WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED A

01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:04.398
EARLY PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:06.467
OR NOT. THE GEO TECHNICAL

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:08.602
REPORT TO WHERE WE START TO GET

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.471
AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS BELOW

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.840
THE GROUND. AND GIVING US AN

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:14.942
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:15.509
STRADDLE US LIKE AS WE- MOVE

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:21.281
FORWARD. SO I THINK THOSE WERE

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:23.283
YOUR- ALL THE LOCAL HIGHER. I

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.051
AM I HAVE TO GO LOOK INTO THAT

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:24.618
A LITTLE BIT MORE TO TRY TO

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.252
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:27.621
IS THERE. AND HOW TO DEFINE

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.457
THAT IS YOUR QUESTION AND WE

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.024
WILL DO THAT AND- TRY TO GET

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:34.928
INFORMATION BACK TO. THANK YOU.

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:35.529
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SENATOR

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:37.898
NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:42.136
CHAIRMAN AND. VERY EXCITING AND

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:45.072
HISTORIC TIME AND I'VE LIKE TO

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:45.639
KIND OF HEARKEN TO THE PAST

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:48.275
JUST BET. AS WE PROCEED TO THE

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:52.212
FUTURE. IT WAS INVASION ONE THE

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:54.782
OLD SIDE HERE THE ICONIC SIDE

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:56.450
WAS DEEMED TO BE NON BUT NOT

01:40:56.517 --> 01:41:01.321
SAFE FOR. EARTHQUAKES. A LOT OF

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:01.922
DISCUSSION OCCURRED AND I WAS

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:04.091
NOT HERE THEN. BUT I WOULD

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:07.628
PROBABLY DO WHAT WENT ON. AND

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.062
THE DESIGN OF THE TWO TWIN

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:12.032
TOWERS WAS BECOMING A PREFERRED

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:13.700
OPTION FOR THE NEW CAPITAL. AND

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:16.570
THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS ICONIC

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:21.608
SIDE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT LIES

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:23.343
REMINDS PREVAILED. AND THE

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.879
RESTORATION OF KURT. IT WAS

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:29.583
RATHER AMAZING THAT. ARTISANS

01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:31.251
AND WORKMEN COULD IN WOMEN

01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:33.554
COULD BE FOUND THAT COULD

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.788
EMULATE THE WORK OF THAT HERE.

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:38.692
IT HAPPENED WONDERFUL. THAT WAS

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:42.996
RESTORED. AND IT WAS DONE IN A

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:43.597
MANNER THAT WAS COMPLIMENTARY

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:46.033
TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES.

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:50.137
ADDITION TO THE CAPITAL. DIDN'T

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:50.737
DETRACT FROM THE DID VIRTUALLY

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:55.676
I WOULD SAY. ADDED TO IT. BUT

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:57.544
AS THIS IS PROGRESS TO DO

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.646
DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A

01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:01.114
HEARKENING TO PRESERVE THAT

01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:03.817
ICONIC INTEGRITY. OF THE

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:04.384
HISTORY OF THE STATE AS ITS

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:09.189
REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CAPITAL.

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:11.124
SOME MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE IN

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:13.060
THE GOLDEN DOME BECAME LESS

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:13.660
GOLDEN THAT IT HAD BEEN BEFORE

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:19.500
BUT- IT WAS LARGELY PRESERVED.

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:21.368
AND IT IS MY HOPE AND I KNOW

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:24.171
THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE.

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:24.771
ARE VERY MUCH DEBT DEVOTED TO

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:30.010
HISTORY. UNDER HERTZBERG CENTER

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:30.577
MORE LIKE AN OBVIOUS YOU ARE

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:34.982
CHAIRMAN I KNOW IS. THAT WE ASK

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:35.516
BROUGH PROCEED THAT WE'RE

01:42:35.582 --> 01:42:38.318
CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. PRESERVER

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.920
PRESERVATION OF THAT ICONIC

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:40.521
INTEGRITY THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED

01:42:40.587 --> 01:42:44.758
HERE. IT ACTUALLY CONTINUED

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:47.661
EVEN TO THE OPENING OF THAT.

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.296
GRAND CAPITAL WHEN THE

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:49.897
RESTORATION WAS COMPLETED AND

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:52.699
THERE WAS A DINNER. IN THE

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:57.170
ROTUNDA FOR ALL THE LEGISLATORS.

01:42:57.237 --> 01:43:00.607
WHAT WAS SERVED WAS PERIOD FOOD.

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:02.643
THE POWER FAMILY OF THE NUT

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.611
TREE FAME ACTUALLY EMULATED THE

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:07.981
KINDS OF MEALS. ONE WOULD HAVE

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.249

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:53.306
AND FORTH WE DO HAVE AN OPTION

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:54.508
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.143
ANYONE HERE WE SHOULD MAKE A

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:57.611
