welcome to the Senate committee on natural resources in water and joint legislative committee on emergency management's joint legislative oversight hearing today will be looking at what caused. The southern California gas companies twenty fifteen blowout at least so canyon and a closer look at the history of management of that field as well as the emergency response efforts to start off I did want to invite the president of our neighborhood council to welcome everyone and give some just brief. Instructions ease some nausea. Thank you and thank you senator stern calling from someone number Smith very much appreciate you being here today. Thanks everybody for coming and participating in this important event for our community. Just a little bit of housekeeping notes. The exits are that door in that door in case of an emergency obviously come out. Any open door. We have refreshments in the back there's cold water there's juice and their cookies and hopefully there's enough for everybody so please get up and help yourself any time you would like. And also I want to say that there is wifi access in the room. I should have started with that one. Wifi access I'm not going to go through the instructions we taped about ten sheets of paper around the back with the instructions on them so I have to bother you too. If you need wifi access take a moment get up and take a look at the instructions and if it does not work for you Dick talk to one of the- neighbor council members and we'll try to help you. Make that access work so with that. Senator and some members thank you very much and it's all yours. Thank you thank you for that welcome thank you to all of you in attendance today as many of you know because we've had conversations with you it's been incredibly important about senator stern myself and our colleagues from across the San Fernando Valley to convene a session like this to answer a number of remaining unresolved questions. About what are we to do as the Ellie so canyon facility remains open remains a concern to the entire community what are we prepared for in terms of an emergency response were there to be another blow out was the response across a number of sectors governmentally and community wide. Sufficient to have protected the community and but we know the answer to many of those questions is no. And so how do we solve it going forward so our hope is to get answers to some of those unresolved questions to continue to move this community towards progress towards safety. And it's a it's a pleasure to have you all here we do have a lot of content to get through we are of course welcoming robust a public comment during this hearing but again thank you all for being here we appreciate your patience with what will be probably a very long series of. Testimony in questioning. I have a public comment is currently structured for the after the third pan after the second panel. So you I'm sorry after the third panel so first we'll be looking at the root cause analysis of the leak with the administration and blade energy. Second will be looking at the response from third parties NGOs and- the gas company if they choose to show up. And third will be looking at the emergency response efforts and public comment would be after the at that point. Yeah. Maybe so. So before we do this match. Do you want to if we want to let some public comment occur at the front end because I know a lot of people are here today who maybe have jobs. Families work to do. And we also know that this community has been fighting for way too long to. Get justice and to shut this facility down but with with with respect to the congressman I did want to let him deliver some opening remarks and then we can figure out if there's a structured way to make a few comments. To the administration at the front end. Okay okay yes Sir yes Sir. So congressman. I'm gonna give them might just to simply member Reavis for a brief opening comment if you'd like and then we'll we'll switch over but it's at your discretion assembly member sure I'm thank you senator stern and assembly member Smith for inviting me to this hearing I represent the east San Fernando Valley and while a lease so is not in my district our community was also affected by this disaster so I wanted to be here to hear for myself from the state agencies and others in terms of what the response was and what we can do better as a state. To prevent this from ever happening so thank you again for inviting me to your committee. Thank you Sally member. Congressman thank you for taking time out of your day well this is a state hearing. We dearly I need your partnership back in Washington and I know you and congressman hill have been on it. Did you want to take a moment. To make a brief opening remark we'd be happy to welcome you. You Sir. The I do hope we hear from the community briefly as well before we go to the panel is to the suggestion I want to thank senator Henry stern and so we members so this myth that read this for joining us at then creating this hearing and I want to thank the Porter ranch community school for hosting us and of course the neighborhood council as well. Of course this school was shut down as a consequence of the only so canyon blow out. Our family lives just up the hill. Just about as close as anyone to well SS twenty five. Our neighbors evacuated for months we relied on those filters. I'm sure they'll be some positions here to tell us whether it was our neighbors are ourselves and made. The right decision. So I can tell you from my own experience that when people move to Porter ranch they were not told. That so cal gas had neglected under ultrasonic testing that would have identified dangerous anomalies. That injections were routinely made through the two being or the casing whatever was handy at the time. And that the deep subsurface safety valves that could have stopped this tragedy. Had been removed in nineteen seventy nine and not replaced. And this was a continuing mistake as they could have been replaced in seventy nine. Or eighty nine or ninety nine. Or two thousand and nine or any day during In the four months that followed the blow out more than eating fat more than eight thousand families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. To schools including this one were closed for the duration of school year thousands affected immediate health symptoms today many residents faced severe health issues we'll have to see. The studies to see what level of. Carnage was done to the humans who were here. Before I criticize the so cal gas company though I should take a minute to criticize the federal government. Few months after the blowout I was able to talk face to face with president Obama he made a commitment that there would be federal natural gas storage safety regulations issued in twenty sixteen. And lo and behold in December of twenty sixteen those regulations were in fact issue not everything I wanted but it for the first time federal safety regulations. Just to be sure. Even after I had this promise from president Obama worked with other members in in June of twenty sixteen we passed a law requiring that there be federal regulations by June of twenty eighteen. Of course that standard was beaten by a year and a half when the Bob administration issued regulations again in December of twenty sixteen. The trump administration withdrew the regulations in twenty seventy. And now they've told me that they're not in violation. Of the law that says they have to have regulations by June of last year because after all they did publish regulations they just went through them. So for those who think that just by watching M. S. N. B. C. you can be aware of all the grievous mistakes of the trump administration you realize that there is not enough time in a twenty four hour news cycle to detail the mall. Including those that affect us here. The state of California has issued regulations. I in rules a- think it's too easy under those rules to avoid having subsurface safety valves and I know. That you will have other hearings as to how tough those regulation should be. But is a part of the federal government it grieves me to report. That in other states there are no regulations in their facilities larger than the one we had here. We know that this tragedy could have been avoided. So cal gas field conduct detailed follow up inspections from other previous leagues there was a weld there was a document and lack of unnecessary risk assessment for the site do a very protections were inadequate there was insufficient inspections prior to twenty fifteen the company had a lack of it of data or even a plan to seal a potential leak. And there was a lack of real time surveillance of the wells. We know that. This from southern California gases actions after the blowout. They found that there were many other wells that needed to be shut down that S. S. twenty five was just the first of the time bombs to go off. So cal gas was ordered to track all of the costs of the lease canyon lake including cost relocating families medical treatment legal fees. However the public utilities commission is still trying to decide whether those costs are going to be passed through to rate payers. The question must be to the P. you see not. Worth the cost necessary after the blowout. What was the blow out a result of negligence. And I think they'll find not one but a thousand small axe medium size extra large Jackson negligence led to this. To do this the largest met a leak in the history I believe of the world. So the shareholders should bear the costs associated with stopping the leak and the costs of remediation add up. A I think if the PC is left to its own devices. We'll let him pass it through they've got to hear from the legislature I believe you did something similar with the fires. Today we're discussing Elise canyon facility that should be shut down the in I just want to say a facility that's too big to fail is too big to exist. The. The negligence shifted into a new phase on October thirteenth twenty fifteen and that is the negligence of failing to even a plan to shut down the facility. So cal gas is dead millions of dollars to fight efforts to shut it down. And there were number one argument is we have no other plans. If we shut it down we will be able to provide gas they'll be blackouts will be service interruptions. Why do they have no other plan because they spend millions of dollars fighting the idea that they should develop another plan. This is we need to be looking at ways to stay first of all there are those who say we've got to wait for the post of fossel of fuel economy and I look forward to a post fossil fuel economy but I'll be if I'm going to wait until opposed fossil fuel economy. Before they shut it down. Natural gas does natural gas really need to be stored locally in in in these enormous quantities. Do we want to store our natural gas by putting it in underground old oil fields where the methane mix which mixes with the witches brew of subterranean hydro pull up way since. Do we want to look at liquid vacation as a way to store natural gas. Maybe not but we've got to look at something and we've got a look at the way the before we get. To a to no natural gas we go we have no storage of lease of gas at least so canyon. Of love natural gas Italy so canyon. So I want to thank you for holding this hearing. Thank you for letting me speak at this time. This is a tragedy that has hit this community. In a continuing tragedy that every day my kids need to look up the hill. And wonder what will happen next. So when it comes to the efforts of southern California gas to pass these costs on to consumers. Shut it down. And when it comes to lease so canyon natural gas storage facility shut it down. Thank you so much. Thank you congressman I think now since the community doesn't just want to speak to the legislature but also to the administration I'm an invite up our first panel. To be here to hear a brief period of testimony and then we'll continue on with the hearing so if it this time we could have secretary crowfoot deputy director Marshall from the California department of conservation. As well as Ravi Krishnamoorthy with blade energy partners join us on the first panel. We can yeah. And I'm sorry so I was just told we also have congresswoman hill has a representative here as well. Congresswoman is been a fighter since the moment she got in the office so if heard district director I believe it's Angela G. a caddy is here. Mr Kerry did you want to make a brief remark before we open for a brief period of community comment. Thank you and welcome and thank you to the congressman sorry thank you I'm in thank you so much for shedding light on this really important issue. I am I representing Congress I'm in hell and we have this brief statement on the issue so in twenty fifteen and twenty sixteen for a period of one hundred and eighteen days. A single pipe storage well at a lease canning gas storage facility. Link tens of thousands of tons of natural gas into the air. More than eight thousand families were forced to evacuate their homes and many suffered health conditions like headaches and nose bleeds. Some suffered worse the incident and heard and estimated one billion in damages and was one of the worst environmental disasters in history. The end the equivalent annual pollution output output of almost six hundred thousand cars. Data mandated by the department of transportation indicates that more than ten thousand wells nationwide. Rely on a single pipe design and that two hundred and ninety six underground storage facilities across thirty two states utilize such wells. We know that these designs are not the safest were more secure let a lease serve as a warning. We need to be working towards implementing stronger solutions in those currently operating storage facilities. These canyons gas leak was the worst single gas leak in U. S. history in terms of environmental impact. Its carbon footprint was larger than the deepwater horizon leak. The release of the full root cause analysis was quite concerning. Among oil and gas production wells gas storage wells did not continue fluid flow to the inner tubing but also allowed flow in the an annual between the casing and the two being provided no protection from leakage in the event causing failure casing failure. The casing failed and the ensuing leak poison to the community. Processes and procedures were not in place to and ensure safe operation. There were certainly shortcomings in regulatory oversight. Some have been corrected and while others are in the process of being corrected. The California legislature did its part with laws like S. B. thirty eight and ask be eight eight seven. Establishing world leading minimum standards for storage wells. California has made numerous improvements in its storage well standards that should be emulated in other states. The only to the LA county department of health and its contractors have been conduct have already conducted some health study work. This is on going through efforts of the south. The south coast air quality management district and the LA county department of health funded in part by legal settlements. These efforts are after the fact however. It should have been it would it it would have been better to research and regulate pro actively some of the public health questions raised by lease canyon may never be answered this is not just about the health and safety of Porter ranch residents although that is of critical importance to us. This is also about insuring that the that in the future there are rapid response plans in place for giant leaks no delays in bringing necessary equipment to stop a spotted leak and state regulators who take a hands on and proactive approach and do not ignore risks. Above all we know now that a lease could have been prevented we know that countless families could have been spared hardship and that the rippling environmental impacts could have been avoided we also know that they should never and can never happen again. We know that we can do better for the people who count on us and we will. Thank you. Thank you ms JK. And now I'd add a difference in respect to the community we'll take fifteen minutes here to offer an opportunity for a few brief public comments so we're gonna let you take an effort at self organizing and up a portion then so it's ten thirty right now. And so depending on how many people are going to be speaking we can apportion the public comments accordingly. Let's take a look here. So we're gonna say two minutes each. So that would be a grand total about seven people. I know there are many more stories in the room and you will each and everyone of you have time to tell your story. But for the moment we're going to ask you to limit it. To two minutes each. Welcome and good morning if you could start by please saying your name and where you're from. Okay on I'm Patti click G. L. U. E. C. K. and I've lived in the Porter ranch area for about twenty five years and I am a native valley girl. And I wanna thank you for holding this right here where it happened one point eight miles away. We're representing the one and a half million residents of the northern San Fernando Valley. Our area covers the spectrum of these social economic scale from apartment dwellers to homeowners in gated communities and for four years we've been lied to by south all gas. The C. P. U. C. darker the county department of public health and many other agencies and even our own brave firefighters have been lied to by cell call gas. And public health we've been in the day with Carson Jensen other toxic chemicals on daily basis with fear major earthquakes. There's been fires on so cal gas property over the years and destroyed homes we were left out of the discussion concerning the consent decree so dairy cal's a couple hundred miles away. Are being used to provide corrosive and explosive Biomet thing to be stored right here only self. And the department of conservation declared a Lisa to be safe. Even though that was before the root cause analysis was really beginning am one blade energy released its report that you'll hear about. It said police so have been poorly maintained and mismanaged so our faith and trust in the system that should have been protecting our health and safety. Has been vastly compromise so I'm presenting the state was some documents for the record. And that includes a series of articles that I did for knock LA. As testimony thank you so much padding. Okay next thank you so much my name is Maureen Capra I have lived here forty five years. I have I side of that well from my front door. When all this happened we've now realize why be been so sick I've gotten asthma the bloody noses everything over all these years not just then. When it happened and everybody moved out and then they started coming back and they would not clean my house because I did not move out. I tried everything this stuff is in my hair it's all inside my house and- our bodies and everything something needs to be done to get rid of this monster up there we really need help and that C. P. you say. If you're here. They were of no help to us at all no help. We need help in getting this thing close so I can stay here this one I bought this property. To live here for ever and you guys are just squeezing me out. And I don't like this please we need your support and your health thank you thank you so much. Welcome good morning name and where you're from Sherri their honeymoon I'm a resident of Porter ranch for fifteen years I currently reside in Granada hit northern Granada hills for two years I served on the board ranch neighborhood council during the- three most exciting years here in Porter ranch your I got elected a year before the gas leak thinking we need to have a concert in the park or maybe an art walk. Didn't know I was going to get a PhD in government. Agencies up at this point I have a few words. At piggy backing on Christmas emergency. Response emergency notification that's critical. Nobody knew my kids school was close we relocated we all know the stories. But moving forward I think it's very very important that we have coordination of agencies. Communication between departments. And putting public safety above all else. I don't know why. It would take nearly four years to even start start the committee on a public. Safety in the study I mean is this crazy anyway thank you again center stern and Christy Smith for. Doing this and we appreciate all you do thank you. Thanks sure. Welcome Sir good morning. Good morning doctor Tom Williams from el Sereno why am I here. Because this has been a tragedy I started helping. Save Porter ranch organization. In twenty fifteen. We found out what was wrong. Tubing flow no it was casing flow all the time since nineteen seventies what causes the corrosion freezing and thawing of the casing the one single barrier protecting the entire community from over two thousand PSI gas. And the entire field how much of the field drained out of that one well guess what every time is the middle was made to doctor and the CPUC including any other well logs. They were wrong they were fraudulent Lee wrong they were done by a contractor under gas company authority they were submitted by a gas company authority to the state. Agencies that were supposed to be regulating them also Dogger requires that every oil field gas field. Have an emergency response plan which is supposed to be approved by the LA county fire department. Nothing was done you put a quarter of a million people at risk because the gas blue well thank god it did not explode. Else wise you would really have a problem however there was only one set of samples taken directly from the blow out. Authorized by the LA county fire department they sent a guy in. With no protection. To sample. Over the lower explosive limit at ten feet from the well blow out. Unprotected another one god help him I don't know what happened to him so there's a real basic problem thank you doctor the laws that were in force at the time. We're being. Documented fraudulently is there a penalty in there. For twenty thirty forty years. There will be I don't know. Thank you thank you for your money. Welcome the morning. My name is Helen a tiny I'm it is in the th of Granada hills for twenty eight years I don't know how much I can cover in two minutes. I'm going to try. I am very angry. I am very upset with my. All my agencies my government's here the health department this doctor was standing there to present the health department this man sitting here to present a Kathryn Barker's office which is their boss. I am not a gas company for what they did to us but that's a business that running because all they think about this money. But these people are supposed to help our- health. There are there to help us they haven't done anything to help us actually they have been back stopping us because this doctor sent a letter. To all the doctors and clinics around here. When my daughter was in the E. R. trailing up. Violently I also tweet test that she protested for toxicology and they said this doctor has sent a letter department of health that's on the letter. For us not to be tested so nothing would be documented I am pissed I'm upset I'm angry. And I think I have every right to be angry my daughter went to Santa Monica when she's there. She's fine. When she comes. Last night she had such a terrible headache. Listening I'm sorry to say this I wasn't going to tone it last night to three thirty in the morning with the stomach issues on this one goes late half an hour for this meeting that I've been promoting. So much because I was sick. To be to live. We should be living here I know I need to move from here but right now for personal reasons. I cannot I have elderly parents have to take care of. I have I have life I know I know is a good time for me to leave. That's why I'm here but this is not right they just shut down this. Fun burger here in Granada hills because they saw a cockroach. They're telling me they cannot shut down displays the. Poisoning everybody. You know what it does to me but I think. This so blood disorders. This is not just headache I'm Illinois. It's way. Way more than that. I need you. To present to the one of us yeah what did the government. Some he told me himself personally at USC number two one year. When they were running for governor he promised me himself I have a picture with him that he would shut this place down when he's in office I'm still waiting for that. Please give him my muscles. Thank you for coming to our coming thank you miss it. Good morning and welcome thank you could go on to the twenty eight year resident Porter ranch never knew of the size of this field. Or new I've ever met anybody that knew the size of this field. Arm there's a major trust issue amongst the regulators in this community. By show of applause how many agree with Helen that there is just no trust with the regulators. So. The trust is I'm I'm I'm searching for an answer in in business and that's what I spent most of my career on when there is this much of a trust issue is because of a misalignment misalignment of objectives and goals etcetera. I'm I have spent personally more time speaking to many of you on this panel who I think everyone would agree are very very busy people with with with contents calendars. This community has never met with our poor supervisor Karyn but Katherine Barker. That is astonishing to me. That I can have a conversation with the state senator about this issue. Or Jason Marshall from pop dagr but I can have a conversation with my supervisor the jerk. I've asked you many times. That one's on you and your boss. So the alignment issue what I would really as an example and I speak with with credibility because- I have been working with public health. For over three years. I am on the community advisory group to interface with public health. On the health study. Yep we're very far apart and with this community needs and deserves and I'll study and I will wrap this up and. And I have to wonder why we are so far apart so we question that deserves to be answered in this hearing. And let's use public health is the example. Is why are you not operating in the public health's interest. What is your charter what what how are you being evaluated. Who gives you directions and what does good lookalike from those people they give you direction because we have a fundamental mis alignment of objectives I'm trying to advocate for my community and my family on health issues. I am not able to do that with the present. Obstacles that public health is put in front of us there is eight don't look don't find and when you do find. I about it. How can this community have trust in that sort of alignment please I would like to leave today with an answer that question who do you serve and how are you evaluated. Thank you thank you Mr Clark. Welcome to morning good morning my name is Alexander Nikki. California director with food water watch we've been working in this community since twenty fourteen when terminal wanted to expand their drilling operations up here and we went door to door in the community and found out pretty quickly that. What Maureen has said is true people had been smelling this have been getting sick for years. And when we try to direct the attention to the gas company point to that say there's something bigger going on here. Everyone ignored us and really said well nobody's ever complained before and then the blowout happened and we were on the ground ready to go and wait I know that's how we met we spoke when you were working for the governor I brown at the time. And you were so helpful you were about the fresh air and I really hope that we can continue to work. Together now that you're in the position that you're in this this issue is about two things accountability which you've heard a lot about. The public agencies who failed us. Who continue to side with the gas company and repeat their talking points and shutting it down and so we really want to know from you where is the governor on this what are you prepared to do what is the plan. We also invite the governor to come to this community and meet with this community you really will not understand what this these people have been through until you have heard their story. And she said that you were on site every day during the blow out you were there when so cal gas failed all those kill attempts right. And you had that responsibility to make sure they were doing their due diligence. That will will will work with the rest of this line here so everyone can be heard but- you've been all very up. Yes civil so thank you so much good morning and welcome Sir yeah many Michael on. Yeah we are all living on a ticking time bomb right here. The big gap whatever the heck you call it you know I mean look at the net go look it all together places that have gone natural gas lookout many people had died because of. The explosion. You know I mean we have children let me here and we have. The talks the you know be had at. I think you can I probably don't even live here do you guys you know you do and- we're just asking for to be shut down I mean. Like I said we're all seeing right now on a ticking time bomb. There's thousands of people who had been killed. In those debate on. Gas explosions. You know because it's not right I mean. Now thank you. Because you know we live we have a right to live to live without having to peer a. Naturally blow jinshi stuff you know and- yeah thank you We're gonna resume this hearing. We hope the gentleman is okay and good health and we think our our first responders for attending quickly as well as- all of our incredible public health and other officials here for attending to the matter. We're gonna resume a brief period of public comment now. And at some point will invite secretary crowfoot back up soon he took a little recess himself but we have a few more minutes a public comment here so at present. Please resume state your name where you're from. And you have two minutes Max. Thank you for cooperating thank you senator Henry stern and thank you for convening this up. Special meeting. And thank you Brad Sherman congressman Sherman for his comments to my name is Robert van to hook I grew up in the northeast San Fernando Valley and so more from nineteen sixties on so I've been in the region for. More than fifty years. I attended to cal state Northridge for six years and during that time majoring in biology and geography we had field trips and bought me to the Porter ranch area in the canyons here. So I've been exposed to the error in the risk of flammable and explosive possibilities. During that time. I now live by the coast and played a ray where there's another gas storage field. Which brings me to my research and investigation there and there is precedent for shutting down. Gas fields of Montebello was officially shut down with state pushing more than twenty years ago or approximately that. Time and the debate at that time was whether to shut down play out a rate or Montebello so both were eligible both were considered. And at the time they just took that first step with one and played a rate. Never got shut down there's also a story of what happens with the gas if we don't have gas facilities will still be able to have gas to our homes. And to commercial places and it'll be the way the state of Arizona stated about it. And the city and county of San Diego do that with direct. Pipeline passage without going through a storage process and it's purchased on the market fairly on when gas is available and from different angles to the interstate pipeline so. It's a baby step it's a small step to eventually going off of petroleum or- carbon fuel. US leaking from LA counties golf course and school and a county park and I was assigned to that park for a number of years and I got sick. And some part of my sickness was physical but I was also feeling stressed knowing that. At any moment the park that I was a supervisor at could go through a- flammability or explosion state depending on the percentage of gas that's concentrated one last. Thought I wanted to add. Is that what I also learned is the public utilities commission you see. Has oversight on what happens to the property when it shuts down and currently we've been noticing in playa del Rey that. At least twenty three properties of already been sold to the private sector and have. On the beach and on the wetlands edge and they get converted into home sites. So we need to have a strategy because we're going to shut this down we're gonna shut it all down. So we need to have a strategy that with a law that in reinforces the public utilities commission to say no to selling their gas company lands to the private sector. And instead go into open space for parks and they'll be safe because as the year goes by with no gas being injected. The gas slowly migrates in evaporates into the atmosphere to safe rate so that's really. Nothing's been done and we're all still up being poisoned by so cal gas. Of first I just wanted to say that we filed a nuisance report against so cal gas. Residents came to my house as did a member of the A. Q. M. D. Marianne fan she came but first you have to stop it so cal gas before she came to my house. And she walked into my house to take the report. And we asked her US so why didn't go so cal gas capture the sixty six point six parts per million. Blow a second league blow out. On their monitors when we caught them on Mars and we have screen shots and she calmly looked at me. Not not batting an icing. All they told me they turn their monitors off. How can that happen today with what we're all living through and going on now they are installing so cal gas and starting to more monitors with. In the neighborhood near eighty parking one up right by there US. Entrance. Are they going to have turn off switches that they can turn it off when they don't like a number that comes out because there's were always dead at two at two or off so anyways that's just one thing I just wanted to bring to your attention. And another thing. Dagr Jason. We had a so cal gas is chemical engineer mei ling testified under oath that the benzene in a lease canyon is a nine hundred to a thousand times more than what's being reported and in fact they were testing anymore so cal gas benzene or for mall don't hide. At all how nothing's been done under oath this came out it was publicized. We haven't heard anything and it's still we still get you know the with the smell I moved in here. One was twenty years ago and we would I would I'm right there at the gate practically I'd come home at two in the morning it roundish open the door hit by a wall of gas. The smell this is twenty years ago and I would call and they say over just venting. Nobody told us what was in those poly toxins that we've been breeding all right. And we still don't know because of the pro. Check the chemicals. So that's another thing another thing that's black and white something for you wrap your head around and take care of. Nothing nothing's done. Anyways those are the two things I just want to bring your tent and I want to introduce my father Matt came back. Here in the middle. He loved his community he love Porter ranch he was a- senior softball manager of two senior softball teams play twice a week. All right he loved life he believed in his government he believed that the government wouldn't let anything happen to us as did all right that's how he raised me. Since the blow out I have learned differently so has the whole community and so has the world. Learned about are captured regulators who are doing nothing except so cal gas is business. And our help department my dad Matt. Now doctor. My dad's doctor wouldn't test for toxins because nothing is harmless because he got a letter saying don't test. All right he came out this is him marching with us after he read your letter and he realized how corrupt you are and your- click health department how they're running they're doing so cal gas is work. Not the people's work all right that's what I wanted to say I'm a shame I'm ashamed of you and what you did and I'll never forgive you my dad passed. A year ago from one of the many cancers that we have in all the cancer clusters in our community. Thank you doctor ragged. Preaches pre sheet that. Thank you very much and Jared why won't Barker meet with us what's going on where we are in pain or community that needs to talk they need some help. Why she refusing to meet with us think not one meeting. We need to clean house clean house thank you. Thank you. As you can tell the community is. Tremendously upset this been going on for such a long time Julie corn Steen member no not member retired member of the Los Angeles board of education. I served on the board for twenty two years. As a matter of fact we're this school is located right now I was the board member who went out with staff to find this particular area. For a school we look to make sure that there weren't wasn't any earthquake fault lines in the area. But no one knew that the gas company was lurking right here in the hills behind the school no one knew. Our health the department that we dealt with did not even tell us or- possibly know about it. I moved into the Porter ranch area forty years ago. There was no disclosure at all. Now what we sell our homes we have to disclose that this monster is lurking in our backyard. You've heard from so many people already about what happened when the disaster. You know it fell upon this community. I was utterly shocked and amazed I got a phone call from the gas company was an automated phone call and I just said stay in your home do not go out. I called the gas company biz I had no idea what was going on. I spoke to someone that answered the phone. They said they didn't even know what I was talking about had no idea I said what could I speak to your supervisor please supervisor was put on the phone. Supervisor said to me. Just stay in your home close your windows do not go out to you hear from us again that's when the explosion took place. None of us knew what was going on no one had any idea whatsoever. So I said to the supervisor you know there are people walking around the neighborhoods they're walking their dogs there are people cleaning pools there people that our gardening they're all out there right now you know what is happening to them what's happening to their health. We didn't know at the time when they said well it was just a little bit of math thing there was a large explosion in the history of the United States. We didn't know that there was other VOCs chemicals benzene hydrogen sulfide and so forth we didn't know what the impact was we didn't know that our animals that were outside with that they would become ill from at her children. We live in an area of earthquake faults here in Porter ranch has you all remember the Northridge earthquake which was. A disaster for all of us. Not only for the community of Northridge but the north valley. How do you have gas wells operating. At and there are gas wells that are fracking in the area as well that could very well cause an earthquake. And yet we have this huge complex the southern California gas company. I keep looking every week or two or a month you see a story on TV on the news of a of a explosion a gas pipe is exploded and natural gas line. You can't mix together communities residents schools to over schools were evacuated because of the odor and no one knew what was coming up out of the wells. You can't mix the two together does not work there has to be another plan. Hi we really need to get. On to much better ways whether it be. Wind turbine or solar or it cetera. But they're happy this has to stop he cannot be a part of this community or in the community for that matter it's for two dangerous. I you know I receive this every month in my which I'm sure all of you do in your gas bill. You know when I read it every month and it says it mentions a- you know materials such as gasoline natural gas. It's a prop sixty five warning. It is if you or add to or near our facilities and work sites you will be exposed to the substances on the state's list of substances known. To cause. Cancer or reproductive toxicity. Natural gas contains subsistence substances on the state list. Are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm and would like they don't say how close you know is it five feet away is it a mile away is it took most of us are just within a mile or two if not right in our backyards. So anyway I employee thank you for. Bringing this to us today thank you scorching. Welcome good morning. Is there like dudes panel thank you for having this hearing my name is David Kerry I've been in this area chats worse which was actually Porter ranch. Turn in the chats were turned in Porter ranch back then. Up for fifty years. My comments sequel requires an environmental impact report where is our E. I. R. eight point four lethal radiation doses from the blow out eight point four million not one groundwater monitoring well. Not one surface water pollutant discharge elimination system system installed outfall nothing nada. We have a massive contaminant plume of hexavalent chromium. That goes on charted. One thousand eighty five chest X. rays per year at this school seven hundred thirty nine chest chest X. rays per year at castle bay elementary. These values represent the radiation dose from Lisa canyon. Massive surface water contamination running a unabated past schools parks neighborhoods. Massive groundwater contamination dis charging as we speak into the neighborhoods No radiological survey by the federal EPA. No independent water sampling by non affiliated to gas company sampling. No tracking the radio nuclides in interstate pipelines. No not testing the materials in the pipelines before there are being deposited at the storage facility. Multiple earthquake faults are under where you're sitting. This means rapid transport of all these contamination including strong team ninety. I'd on one thirty one. Radio hexavalent chromium hydrogen sulfide in countless untested cancer causing chemicals radioisotopes to the surface where people live in this community. Earthquake fault faults nearly one dozen known faults exist under the storage facility regarding the unknown faults it is in anyone's guess but by judging the way the Northridge Northridge quake originated from an unknown fault they should tell the panel something. In nineteen seventy five will fire. It was caused by sparks from St hitting the inside of casing and tubing a fire that took four plus years to put out. Today this same sand fills a sandstone cap stores reservoir in abundance. In nineteen seventy nine subsurface well safety valves were removed. This after the well fire was finally cap I read a dare predecessor boots and coots Santa's been flying up the wells ever since. There is no end to the sparks in fact fires are a disaster waiting to happen. This is new gas. Highly corrosive highly radioactive deadly. Harvested from uranium shale from places like the San Juan basin and set in New Mexico. And the Permian basin in the Texas panhandle. Uranium shell gas is what is being the positive it'll be so canyon not somebody nine formulation from yesterday. But the new formulation that kills people out right. When full with winter storage leaks are happening all over the place and not at just that says twenty five in Browns canyon about two football fields away from your where you sit. In this room at least so you ram gas floods the roots of ancient oak trees that have tapped into the water table for over six hundred years in some cases. This same gas flows out of the canyon walls very varying exposure points such as similar geologic straddle layers of rock which gas loses out changing from liquid form. To gaseous form. Fugitive emissions are rife. And the aquifer meets the surface and multiple points and it is the operator doctor instructs the gas company to use. To the dump its poisons including things like radioactive tracers strontium ninety tridium I'd I one thirty one and various beta particle radiation and alpha radiation. Radioactive tracers accompanied shell gas transported here from across the California desert and points east. These are always part of the gas places into storage here. These tracers have been sprayed all over this community and especially during the blow out. So any my comment. Earthquake faults act like freeways in that contamination from the nine thousand foot deep storage reservoirs transported into neighborhoods through a multitude of my Great Migration pathways when a fault line intersects the water table methane converts from gases phase into liquid phase benzene and other volatile organic compounds are then transported into the groundwater in out to the neighborhoods at a multitude of seeps and springs downslope. Radioactive contamination then makes its way to the surface contaminating the water ways when it rains the radioactive particles spread infecting parks schools and bedrooms when the winds blow massive amounts of radioactive particles in fact the neighborhoods. Lastly Los Angeles regional water board reporting is inadequate. G. O. Syntek is ran by the gas company they're reporting is a joke state EPA. Needs to take over sampling. This is now an environmental poisoning issue cal EPA and federal EPA need to be involved. The pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration needs to be working with the state fire marshal in providing full disclosure on the contents of the materials placed in the pipes that carry gas here for storage the state must produce manifest of all trucks. That carry chemicals into the storage site several open pits have been used for dumping chemicals into the creeks that flow offsite. Radiation has been this discovered off site in the same creeks the gas company as open pits that dumped directly into the creek beds when the rays rainy season occurs each year constituents of concern begin to flow downstream off the storage facility and into the communities thank you Sir and if you could submit your testimony for the record we appreciate the thoroughness of it we to preach. We appreciate. Written that written testimony certain trip thank you Sir. Hi Nancy Hernandez I can't believe we're still doing this hits home for years as a joke fiercely specially with everything you know everything that's been uncovered one I guess I once a couple things but one thing is we do need that place that facility shut down shut down permanently and shut down not used for anything else because somebody I think. Sherman I've heard others comment we're not gonna store natural gas will okay no you shouldn't store anything and it needs to be just shut down and not used for anything not storing uranium not storing lithium. If you know what I'm getting at. Is CP you see here I don't they are they're not up here but there any are there here okay well. I'm trying to understand when the root cause analysis just came out with blade it's my understanding that C. B. U. C. instructed so cal gas. And may have been doggerel so to find qualified companies to perform the root cause. So cal gas. Provided a list. Of companies they wanted to use to provide to perform this root cause analysis. And blade was chosen so at this point I have to ask you should we be restructuring our judicial system. So that the criminal standing trial can choose his own jury. Because really that's essentially what you all allowed to occur. Dr Cyrus rang in. Gosh. What else again I was one of the first parents to do toxicology tests after he said you know send out the letter don't do these toxicology tests I went out of state had them perform did them again to you this was in two thousand early two thousand sixteen did to them again in two thousand seventeen and eighteen now will probably continue to do it to see our changes. We moved away two years ago. And. So cal gas back my health is in Chatsworth. I reported the oily stains. They sent out an inspector third party audit the inspector came out and I said well I didn't say it was Elise I told them they are stains in my house on the outside the exterior and the concrete of my house. Send out the inspector the inspector said this is all oil and I said well I didn't think oil would have reached all the way over here because I am. I was literally four miles out. He said I'm gonna write a report and I'm gonna present it to them they will decline you. Said okay. Never hear back from them I call back several weeks later and they said we have to there was an issue with that report. We're gonna send out another inspector okay not a third party comes out. Takes pictures sample leave I have to call back again obviously two weeks later there was another issue we're going to send a different company so they send out a different company and then to so cal gas. Gentleman come in and take samples. They say the results we can find or they were inconclusive or there is nothing we are denying your claim I said okay I contact department of public health and let them know what occurred Katy Butler says I'm gonna send one of our inspectors this is insane I know that she said I know that they are denying anyone who's beyond the two mile radius okay. She sends out her inspector call and I believe is his name take samples. Wait wait I don't hear anything back I call her and she tells me that the results were inconclusive I said what can I see the data can I see what the lab. I had to show and she said we did not send it to the lab. And I said what. I told you. Exactly what I was told it could be you guys just announced that you found heavy metals. She said there was excessive higher than normal. Amounts of dust found in your home. Okay. So obviously you're supposed to test that for heavy metals right that was the purpose of you testing the exterior. And she said well yes it is consistent with all the other homes in Porter ranch so where are the results well I'm gonna have to ask for funds to be able to send it to the lab. And I just thought okay that's just ridiculous. Of and then I think it was a. At the Hilton February first and second. I did mention to the local which is over here I let him know this whole story and he said oh well okay let me have doctor ring again come over explain it to him. Explain it to him he said let me have your phone number let me have your address and I will get back to you in a week. Well it's like two years and I'm still waiting for that call. I don't know what else is going to take honestly this thank you thank. No no I'm sorry I'm not done sorry sorry but I do want to ask I don't ask him twice today and I did it in front of you. Henry I would like to ask doctor ring again. If you have any amount of decency just the slightest compassion particularly for children Europe pediatrician for crying out loud. Please present your immediate resignation. And I will. I want to ask the community by showing a raise of hands if you agree yeah. Thank you. Good morning welcome to the Middle from grandmother he'll United Nations say you cannot be years ago that we have put a year by twenty thirty the we're on the verge of put the goodies when we want to release the met paying that these in the ocean are you getting at all if we monitor for all your family. You know and this is not a. Fiction thing we already have five month extension we already know. Thank you pretty well. You know the study to the but it did. So if you with more than two hundred years old. We already have beeping normal use. You're not. Back can replace the thing if you. Believe that these this stop. Fiction all. Are up to month so if you months ago. It was a relief are indeed one of the major newspaper that the day be the one they bought thing. The first and then they're going to go from here but you're paying in. Being paying minutes you know. Not only can be rich but this new form of energy. But you have to do the research and the call out that's not. James Brown. It. Was working but in the forty. Fifties you know. We already have this kind of thing all of you. You are all represented you have to go on porch don't let these big corporation the article put you have appeared on both the penal. Por Exxon all of the- investment that they haven't but it'll that's when. They give you money everybody. Is not only a. Over here for. Such a little really we have to go for new form of energy. That people really. In the- I'm a big guy the- the guy the energy. The machine is already being invented from the- I am fifty we already have the fans. What we are asking you sent up the road there. Please have exploratory committee you know who I'm have some people to do the research in this new form of energy if we let this corporation. I club. Or funny without having the in the future because the methane is it but the coming in great quantity of fuel we want to do that we have already. For the doctor that would put the I'm a food. I'm. If we let this movie is going to be in men for months. Let's see if I'm up into the fifteen kilometer I maintain that if in the ocean we happened to be. I think it almost Saddam also young on ten to the twenty killer up twenty. Two kilograms what it. You know when you that it will be a question you're going to be a question we don't have any future we will have basement paint to come outside. So it's up to you. I used to prevent the new invention. To me let me up you know. My son. Please. Then there yes what we know that the fit. On the doctor over here. I discussed. With the and you know we know that the thing like you think see from the safety we know that the what is. Going on a program that they have out hi. Ladies guy bald. Program which in which they both disk idea. And that he- thought please open your mind a little bit. The study about nickel. Slot you know it's funny about games the brand that discovered young because everything. That I can be fifty. But we have to look at thirteen in the night of the money to you know yeah in the mail you'll be. Off that you represent us. Yeah so don't go anymore with fourth if you. But it is thought to do the thing immediately you know yes we know how much time. Thank you very much Sir. Sorry to throw another state hearing schedule all off. But these people apparently I try to self regulate them they wouldn't be regulated. Kinda like the same agencies you brought here today that refused to. Regulate but that's your job. You guys for coming here to hear from the people Rackley you can have these regulators all day long up in Sacramento but thank you for coming here and seeing the problem. And having it so poignantly. She waited by Michael passing out on the floor. But what really killed us and this will really emphasize what we're we're dealing with with especially the health department is all about health. Oh sorry meant to go president and cofounder of say Porter ranch twelve year resident. It's all about how it would be here. Wasn't the issue so seeing and I took a quick poll when this happened. We saw doctor. Rank in supposedly helping out Michael on the floor here it made us sick. Because I don't know what his intentions are and we don't know what the whole health department intentions are the news pulling their strings so seeing that guy here was. Very disturbing. That your guys job to figure the best thing the hell out. You gonna grow all these agencies but it's your job to regulate these regulators so do it thank you. Thank you. Thank you for Matthews number the board of say Porter ranch and I'm also a member of the executive board and legislation committee of the California Democratic Party. On behalf of them I would like to remind you that the state party platform calls for the immediate shutdown of this facility and I would hope. I would hope that all of our democratic legislators would be listening to the state party platform. I want to thank the legislators who are here thank you so much for being here I noticed that all of you who are here are local and you are those. Who have been hearing again again about all of our pain and many of you have experienced some of that paying yourself and- really appreciate the support that you have given us. But I'm also very disappointed that we don't have legislators from around the state here to listen to us they are the ones who haven't heard our pain. They haven't heard all these problems all of these stories that all these people have. And hearing that there is not a single person here who is calling for keeping this facility open it's gonna be shut down. I had a forty year career as an engineer. Working with toxic materials serving on company safety teams. And it's obvious to me as an engineer that this facility never should have been re opened it's a basic engineering principle. But when you have a major product failure you don't start to deliver that product again. Until you've done the root cause analysis and you've demonstrated that every single item in that root cause analysis. You have a draft and we didn't do that and when the root cause analysis came out we saw that there were a whole lot of unaddressed problems. And yet the facility keeps operating and we cannot allow that. Never should have re opened we got a close it as soon as we can. One of the most important things in the root cause analysis that I see. Is it mentioning that the gas company has a lack of a safety culture. And that really is the root cause of all of the other root causes so we really have to get out that. The report says that there really isn't any documentation that shows a safety culture. And that really should be emphasized a lot more than what's in the report because that lack of documentation is itself proof of the lack of safety culture. As an example in my work on safety teams we're going around we saw worker had a bottle of water to clean parts at times. And we wrote that up because it didn't say water on the bottle and if somebody else came along and accidentally spilled that bottle they wouldn't know if they still something hazardous. We wrote up reports and we did that because you need to have the documentation of all these things you can do. Measure them against all of your metric see if your metrics are actually providing the safety you need. Improve your process sees based on that and without the documentation the gas company has not been doing anything to its improve its processes. And this is been going on year after year after year. Another example is the material safety data sheets these are required by OSHA and other agencies so that when you have a spill. You know immediately what are the hazards what what effect is this can have on people you can notify all the people who. Were exposed what it is they were exposed to and what they need to do about it. And what happened after this blow out was the gas company kept saying there's nothing toxic here that it's perfectly safe you don't have to worry about. But the gas was old arise with math former captain and the material safety data sheet for mark captain rates the health risk as four out of for. The highest risk in sales long term exposure causes lung damage and all of us here. Have long term exposure during the many months of this blow out. They were lying to us they were not following the procedures that are they are following the documentation. The root cause analysis also notes that they've been reactive rather than proactive it documents a long history of accident after action after accident all they ever do is they fix that immediate problem and they've never looked at the bigger problem why do they keep having a weekly leaks. They need to be addressing the bigger thing being proactive to deal with all of this. A gelling sample that this goes way back to the very beginning this facility opened as a gas storage facility in nineteen seventy three. The very next year we had a massive blow out and fire that went on and on forever and the gas company had no idea how to put out the fire they had to bring in. Famous oil fire fighter reddit dear to common to put out the fire for them. And forty years later they still haven't learned those lessons. And so we need legislation that addresses safety very specifically thank. Thank you. Few last sentences we need to have legislation that says that natural gas may not be stored at an unsafe natural gas storage facility that should go without saying how could you not to say something like that it's so obvious yet we don't actually have that in the law. We should define the natural gas storage facility shall be deemed unsafe if in the life of the facility it is weak more than a ton of gas yeah that's basically the death penalty for a facility if you get up to that level you've had so many weeks that it's added up to that much chaos. Then you should be operating at all we didn't leak one ton of gas we leaked a. Hundred thousand tons of gas during this blow out. Facility should be deemed unsafe for the facility uses wells the pierced the plane of an active. Seismic fault. This is the two of them the fall because the magnitude six point seven Northridge earthquake. The fault to produce the magnitude six point seven silmar earthquake both faults come and join right under this facility passed straight through these wells. And we've been warned that if there's another earthquake on those faults they could slice right through them. We can have a blow out a hundred times as big as this. And finally the facility should be deemed unsafe if it does not use subsurface safety valves they took out the valves that they had they refused to put them in because they're too inconvenient. Well our health is not an inconvenience. To shut it down and out thank you thank you. Okay lastly welcome okay my name is ed bath I've been in since here since two thousand one I have a very simple question that I think most people here to find out and that is does the gas company answer to the state or does the state answer to the gas company. That's why we here. That's the Gansu were trying to find out what all the complications. That's the answer would like to come out. Who answers to who. Well let me answer it on. A personal note it is I answer to you. And we work for you. And the government its job is to rein in corporate power when it is in excess and so. This suffering in this community is going through which we just heard in stark detail this morning is the reason we're here. There been failures not just at the gas company but truly within government itself. And for that we all have to take responsibility. You know my opening remark today is just gonna be that. I answers to questions are not going to be enough. We need results. And. I agree with that the testimony this morning that a lease so canyon needs to be shut down. That decision. Will be decided by the public utilities commission in the coming months in it in the preceding operated under is Senate bill that I wrote for then senator Fran Pavley Senate bill three eighty and they're currently studying the quote unquote feasibility of operating without a lease so canyon. But your gas company your public utility certainly does not want that to occur. This is a very valuable formation that is generated hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in profit. And so one of the central questions we're gonna be trying to drive towards today. Is if that indeed is such a profitable facility that the shareholders benefit from why not the shareholders cover the cost. Of that facility as well. So. The root cause analysis was required under Senate bill three eighty as well as a number of other emergency response plans. That will be exploring in further detail here today. But the question that will be crucial goes beyond this room it is not just a matter of the people in here suffering but is the rate payers of all of southern California whose pocket books are on the line. With the decision pending for the public utilities commission. If the public feel utilities commission finds that the gas company in the decades of operation of this field was prudent. And reasonable. They can pass that cost. Almost a billion dollars now. On to the rate payers beyond Porter ranch to all of southern California. And I guarantee you they'd like to do so based on their initial comments back to the public utilities commission. The alternative path. Is that if they were found to have been imprudent or beyond imprudence. Reckless knowingly disregarding a foreseeable risk that pipes corrode. Which I think you'll all realize after hearing some testimony today that doesn't take an engineer. Or a geologist understand that pipes corrode over time. If that was a foreseeable risk that was either ignored. Or knowingly acknowledged and set aside and that costs cannot be passed through to the rate payers of southern California and the gas companies rate payers I mean shareholders need to take that bill. They'll say they don't have the balance sheet to do so but backing them is one of the largest corporations in the nation Sempra energy. And Sampras been using this field for years as not just a way to deliver retail gas supply to your stoves in your heaters but also as a hedging strategy. To improve their stock market rating by finding price disparity so that they buy low and sell high just like any other company would. The problem is that it's in your backyard. And it's in all of our backyard and I don't think we can afford that risk. We ran legislation the first year I entered office to close that facility Senate bill fifty seven. Made failed on the Senate floor so to the testimony regarding the need for other legislators in the state of California to hear your voices I couldn't agree more. So lonely fight in Sacramento sometimes and there are many threats that they'll take away your still at the drive up your bills hundreds of dollars by closing this facility well tell you it's fear. That's not reality the technology exists today. To move ourselves pass gas. To a future that we can live for a wanna thank. I want to thank governor Newsome to start. I will be going to his secretary was recently appointed and confirmed by the Senate. The new secretary the California natural resources agency Wade crowfoot. But this governor himself who I've spoken to as many of you have personally. Has committed to the closure of a lease so can you. Now the question is how to follow through on that commitment. And how to overcome the political forces in his way. I know you all stand with him and we do as well. But here today we're going to be focusing on this root cause analysis. Of the leak itself. And why. Why that was allowed for decades to continue as it was. So first off we're gonna ask US secretary crowfoot to open up with testimony. And then we're going to move on to Robbie Krishna mercy who led the blade energy partners independence root cause analysis as required by law. And lastly will have Jason Marshall here with who's the deputy director of the California department conservation who is overseeing dog at the time of. The blow out as well as under. Current law. So without further ado secretary crowfoot I do want you all to know that he himself suggested that. We offer a little bit different order this morning and I know it's been a- a re shuffling but to hear from you first. He's been through this too so we appreciate you making the trip. And we know the lift is large but please secretary crowfoot will light up with your testimony then respond questions they answer thanks so much senator stern. Assembly members let me just first acknowledge you know what is clearly anger fear and frustration from residents here today. I think the message that. You know your community need to delve to lever has been delivered and I do think it was helpful to have the context of public comment first. I remember those a hundred eleven days well but very differently than you do. I work for governor news governor brown at the time in in our office I was our point person interacting with the agencies that were. Working to. Stop the leak. I'm so I came down here quite a bit but I came down here I got on the plane came down here this was your backyard. Now you live this for a hundred eleven days. I have a five year old daughter now. And we lived in Oakland. This summer I when we're dealing with the pretty toxic fire wildfire smoke. And had to get her the end ninety five mask and I remember being. Really cared about her spending too much time outdoors. I can only imagine what it was like to have the apparent at that time. Omits confusion a lack of information and concerns about your health. I and your kids health so I just want to acknowledge that. What we've been asked to do. Here today is talk about the set of actions that's taken place since. You know almost four years ago and we're going to do that. But as we get into the tedium of the root cause analysis at cetera. Just know that we get the larger point which is your fundamental dissatisfaction with the actions that have taken place. Now I believe actually that many of the actions that have taken place including these regulations that past overseeing natural gas facilities in October twenty eighteen are strong. Some of it we have characterized them as as stronger than any other state but again I want to acknowledge where you come from which is that's not enough and at least. Help you understand that that we understand your position. I'm happy to opine on on the root cause analysis any we'll hear from experts I'll also just mention. The priority that I know you all share with governor Newsome Diddy carbonized our economy and reduce our dependence on fossil fuel. I think he said it you know we were at a- oil seepage in Bakersfield just two weeks ago with the governor and the governor was really clear in the middle of the you know I'm oil field that. You know we believe that California's energy future is a D. carbonized future where reduce dependence on fossil fuels so we're all moving in that direction. We want to move in that direction the question is what's the pathway. And that's really I think the meat of what you know senator stern you're working on as it relates to the future of this facility. So I'll stop there and then I can respond as as helpful to the testimony provided. Will come back to you with further questions and allowed the continuation the testimony. Mr Krishnamoorthy do you want to proceed next I believe a presentation for us as well. Okay thank you Sir. Just push the button yeah sorry about that. Our. Thank you at thank you for having me here. I'm going to be very technical in this talk we will retain that in ended January twenty sixteen. Val was to leaking at that point when we came on site. And there was a large demon blade dad that was working on it four of my colleagues here bill Randy Nigel and Greg are with me here today. This was a long process for us it took us nearly. Three and a half years and hopefully I can go to the next slide. Yum it took us nearly three and a half years night it took a lot of support from a lot of different groups and I want to. Acknowledge Cebu seein Dogger. We were tasked the scope that was given to us was independent root cause analysis independence to us means something. It means no influence from anybody. And as C. Pusey in dog are rare fully supportive of that day's supported us in any logistical requirements. Through the process. We had no input our- our ad no nobody gives any directions in which to take this project and similarly I would like to acknowledge so cal gas. They did two things they also provided us complete independence. Number two will be as you can see from the report which I'll discuss in a few minutes. There is an inordinate amount of data we collected data we treat it quite so cal support and more importantly we had to get physical evidence. At that was essential to any conclusion we could make. So I would like to acknowledge so cal gas and lastly there were twenty three service companies that work with us for the last three and a half years. And I'll go through the work and hopefully it gives you a flavor for white took us so long and. And hopefully it was it was a valuable insight into what happened. Any root cause analysis is a systematic process you cannot just jump in and collect data. You start interpreting so we developed a phased approach we discussed with all the parties we started with data collection we didn't want anything of the site touched which was phase one we wanted to once the weather was successfully controlled. Controlled was turned over to see if you see and then no action was taken out on location without blades and put on the blades it no nobody could move anything on location without our input so. We rent in phase one we went to the site collected lots of whatever information we could we ran some what we call at that point there was a crater many of you remember there was a crater we ran some what we call to bring logs the latest technology. That is available in the industry across the globe to figure out what may have happened before we did anything to the location that was phase one. Phase two was filling up the crater phase three was pulling everything out putting everything out sounds simple. But for our conclusions to be made today. We had to get everything in pristine form if anything is damaged. I it's no different than any investigation you have to have. Everything together to interpret anything recognizing. Well was flying for a hundred and fourteen days or something. They were killed Floyd's pumped in Munich at night all of that but still we wanted to and that's Pristina form as we could. And then the last two phases was analyzing the data combining the information. Oops okay now I want everybody to this is an important slide I think it's on the monitor and it's here there are three or four things in an oil well or a gas well this is pretty normal the first thing I want to point out is that it's a small thing called surface casing which goes to nine ninety feet that is eleven and three quarter inch that was partially cemented in nineteen fifty four. When the pump see meant and this is common to all of us in a lease so you lose see meant that set and apps. The sea meant was pretty ratty in poor condition. And then there is the next biggest of pipe or OR casing that runs it's called the seven inch casing. And what you will notice at the bottom there's a shaded area it is seem ended up to seven thousand feet. At the bottom. And then about that is what we call drilling mud. This was not uncommon practice is quite common in those days. Even today many roles are drilled and completed this way. And there's drilling mud all the way to the top. Okay and then come inside and then the smallest pipe there that's the tubing. Two and seven eights. When it was an oil well. The tubing was used for. Producing pumping oil. In nineteen seventy three when the world was converted to gas storage. You'll see the last to add the expanded port that there is a parked there. We had gas would come from there is a water into the tubing and from the tubing get into the seven inch casing. And come all the way to. And you needed that FOR William William reasons. They were producing through the tubing and through the casing that was the- modus operandi and this is the operational style all over the U. S. US for gas twenty twelve this is not uncommon. This is not unique to lease or California. Okay the most important thing to know about SS twenty five was. Regulations required noise and temperature logs I'll touch on it in a little bit later. But there were no leaks or failures in SS twenty five there is no indication of anything happening ever on this is twenty five. There were other was that had problems will talk about that in a minute. But the I've broken this discussion into three portions. I will first talk about the failure itself then I will talk about what happened after the failure. And then lastly I'll talk about how the Elise canyon was managed as a facility. So let's look at the office twenty five failure this is the condition under which we got the well on. Middle of February twenty sixteen. This is what you will see at the bottom right about there is a word that is seen meant the weather was controlled it was. It was captain no no gas was coming anywhere it was safe to get into the well another well. And then I point out things and read there which are the metal lost locations. And the one on top at about eight hundred and ninety feet to be interpreted at that point was the main failure so we knew where the failure once. So everything we did after that operationally was important to protect that location. Anything we did it internally we talked a hundred times acted ones. So we went through a lot of detail work there. So I'm gonna jump a recognizing my time limit here on the right side is that option itself that shows on the left hand side of that right side is a picture. That shows how the seven inch casing was was broken up. There are two things to notice about that first is there is a failure of better let that is running up and down and I use the word axial ruptured to describe that. Then you will see something broken up second. Financially we call that second financial parting. Axial rupture circumferential parting the moment we see this at the bottom it's bunched axially. So I know immediately that happened first. So a lot of things you can you can infer from looking just looking at the piece you can say Hey that happen first. When you look closely there is some corrosion on the ordeal of the seven inch. Not recognize the seven inches ciment at seven thousand feet. About that it's a drilling mud. Drilling mud normally when you put there from a drilling practice point if it's what we call high PH. Which was not corrode corrosion should not be a problem conventionally. Okay so the let's let's look at this a little bit more carefully. Yes now I am focusing in on zooming in on that axial rupture where we believe the failure origin native. And what you will notice there. Is technically it's a very interesting feature there are what we call grooves that are running axially. And then they'd look at its like fractals its grooves within grooves it's very unusual form of corrosion. There is very little to normal literature on this type of this this the way it looks then when you look at that small piece there that are smaller tunnels that are. That are made into the metal. Of course we suspected microbial corrosion we validated as microbial corrosion at that point. And it is discussed in the report. So that corrosion there that that wall that pain three inches long that area. And on the morning of October twenty third. Sometime after three to four AM that drop trick that failed and that resulted in that. That cracked it is running in this gets up and down I'm showing it flat is running left to right after. That ruptured that the event was the first event okay we looked at all the all the data that we got that we carefully collected. We could interpret that happened and then it stopped that happen at some point stopped. Next gas was leaking through that rupture area and I'll come to the quantity of gas. And then it split second financially now why can I say that I can say that because there is very little plasticity there. I know the metal was extremely cold we calculated the temperature that it called to metallurgical Lee and modeling lice. So we're comfortable saying that's the second round. So there is strictly speaking to separate events that combined and because this. All of this we believe happened on. October twenty third sometime after three thirty in the morning we believe the circumferential rupture happen sometime around seven AM at eight AM and then the next one happened couple hours prior. So I'm I'm jumping to the conclusions of the report so there if you can follow me one two three four five wonder prisons nineteen nineteen fifty four the drilling fluid is there there is not corrosion sh nothing should grow at that point it was well designed go to number two or punitive time this is higher density marred it drops it leaks off it is replaced by migrating groundwater in step three. This groundwater had microbes in it whether it collected microbes are microbes grew with it it grew. Over time it corroded and four and five. And what I'm not talked about up to note is that eleven and three quarter inch also had did not have good seem and there was water outside. That also corroded. Which which was. Which was one of the reasons that the well was blowing on surface the way below. So we had a pretty clear idea how the corrosion happened. Let me look at the time and this time line was at a very important to us because- at that point we didn't know whether they- are one of the suspicions we had which was wrong it was that the killer temps cost things to get worse. And the way we concluded that will but I'd your physical and actual data. Is what I'm showing you here is the pressure data from the compressors called injection header. It's about a thousand feet approximately from SS twenty five. And the blue line is pressure at about two PM on October twenty second they shut off injection to SS twenty five. And I know that because the pressure drop from twenty eight hundred to about twenty seven eighty PSI dropped. No I know I didn't fail during that shut off that shut off period from two PM in of doctor would twenty second October twenty third. Because if twenty five failed that pressure would have dropped down to five hundred PSI. So I nor did not fail them. Then at three between three and four AM they started injection back so you can see it's back to about. Twenty eight LBS I so I know very clearly. That it did not happen until. After three or four AM in the morning of October twenty third. Now I want we want to do is to tighten up the time a little bit more. You look at the red line that is the temperature now I know the mosquitos cord and it split second financially. So I know that circumstantial split has to happen basin the temperature we physically estimated and modeling estimated. That the gas temperature was ready court at that point and that happened between seven to eight AM in the morning so we know seven to eight PM with the second version of the rapture. An hour before would have been the axial rupture. So what happened when the doctor happen this happen sometime in the morning. Sometime let's say six seven. It's an estimate it's not exact but we're pretty confident that sometime in that period it happened. So I'm showing you two lines here. And we calculated in the. Hi leave at that that are fracture so the formation can absorb you may not see anything on so for that that point and then you have about seventy million coming eighty seven ninety million coming from the formation seventy million still being injected I don't in sixty going through there. And at three fifteen this melted they shut it off and at that point of course the seventy million went away but the ninety from that as work continued to be going on. At that point it was smiling. So the key takeaway for us was all failures happen one day on October twenty third. VA before any kilograms was started the first collectibles October twenty fourth. So that gives a very good feel what happened up to the point of incest with books. What do you do. I'm sorry. Post leak around so I'm not going to jump into what happened after the leak was discovered YA where we interested our job was rude because- I've already figured out. Of because I didn't know all of this until. Eight months ago but- if I figured why do I need to know apple students posted in so many important because- initially they reported on daily reports the leak was small then. And today it was a blow out to sort of a different accounts we had to go by all the records. Doggett had daily reports Ocala daily reports some service companies a daily reports we looked at it. We have to understand how how gas Lou how much gas blue. Did they can let them to make it any any worse. So we did some floor eight and I would like to call Kim Marling I'm going to I'm giving you a conclusion. What we did was we looked at twenty years of flow test data from so cal gas. Using that we build would be called a well inflow and outflow. So at any point. With the with some pressure date I can't we can tell you pretty acted reasonably accurately. How much gas was coming out of the well. So we estimated what I'm showing you there if you just follow the green dots there. Basil all the morning we did all the analysis we did we are giving we establish a floated every day. Every day and it was a match to it pressure data from an observation while. So I know one day one it was ninety three million. And those red lines are the days when they can let them start happening so every kill attempt either. Via a pretty good idea what the what was blood flowing out. No we did a detail modeling here we also have in the report some back of the envelope. Quick calculations you can do to get approximate numbers. Bays on pressured information. So there's two different ways you have to know floated. Before you figure out how to kill a. Sold as we probe we model this is a commercially available software anybody can buy the software. This two three different companies that sell the software. We use a software call drill bench remodel the collective sui said what would it take to kill the well. And we also look at how we do us the well was killed and we also took into assumption of course because we were doing the root cause I knew exactly what dept the weather was killed that so we said we said okay I don't know let's say a V. somebody is in four hundred feet. Could you have done this somebody's in thousand feet so we did all the scenarios. Our conclusion was the well could have been successfully killed. This is we'd show we discussed with with the expert with other experts who have level control experts the modeling data confirmed it other other similar experts confirmed it with the modeling data that does well could have been killed prior to the leaf fell into section of the wellbore perhaps first two or three kills your figure for getting out what is. Happening by it but the thing by the total for two out for. Kilograms this well should have been killed. And what you see here is table twenty one from the report. This is sad Ken number three. What what should have what perhaps should have been tried. Is a heavier mud twelve to fifteen pounds per gallon. Pumped at about six to eight barrels per minute. Now the proof for this is art by the time they went to can number seven. They had modeled it. Killed two through six no morning was done prior to kill seven which was December twenty second. Day model it and they went in with fifteen pound per gallon be nearly controlled the route and there by a fifteen that I forget the date there eighteen. December it was about. Fifteen fifty one of. Fifty five million today was much lower than that ninety three. But by that time and they got it under control the location was in very bad shape they were craters there. So they had to abandon that was really it was too risky to continue coming up. But this that the art analysis shows that at a higher density an appropriate money it could have been killed. Okay so the last part of my discussion here. Lisa can encasing in that what we were after here was to understand. Our our edict was will cause analysis so we wanted to look at all the routes however they managed. Was some of the problems seen another wells. Where the exactly the same that was an intent when we took this on. And of course this is in the report there is a history of casing leaks in in a diesel. And there is no relationship with age this is not a function of age of the well there are some newer residential leak some or all of us to the show so there are different reasons normally there are different reasons every one of them for me to get it immediately needed me they would either put a Siemens and they're they're putting their kissing in their scalp Linus liners in there it was effectively managed immediately it was the it was always controlled. How aware what we observed was we couldn't go back and figure why these happen that's would be right after our job was one our job was to ask why everything we asked why he said why did you why why did these corrosion happen was. It in the cellar. We follow no evidence of that. Then the second point I want to make. Is in nineteen eighty eight there was a memo it was a very proactive. Action taken in nineteen eighty eight. There was that reported an internal memo said we need to inspect twenty routes all these twenty rows. Different people had approved it. Seven out of the twenty what inspected this was very pioneering in nineteen eighty eight four Donald condition soul pipelines a different story but don't hold it was quite pioneering not too many people inspecting those days. And five of the seven had external corrosion. But then we lost track of data there was no data to tell as white was suddenly stopped. All five of them had external corrosion source it was not the same as a lethal. But there was external corrosion external cut like some corrosion I mean on the outside of the seven inch. Inside of a seven inch the gas is dry this what we call. Pipeline quality gas. Should not corrode at all. Now the next bit of data we looked at was there was a general rate case submission in twenty sixteen that testimony was. So cal gas had identified risk assessment was necessary the required a storage integrity management plan which has since been implemented. Our dad was recognized by so cal gas it was also recognized as part of the submission. That their their integrity of the I was being reactive up to that not being proactive because recognized by so cal gas. It was so cal gas is interpretation of that point. So those recognition that pre twenty fifteen any leak immediately fix it but- not not figure why wont how extensive. The whole risk assessment process. So we had all our data now we had we understood what happened on the failure we understood what happened. After the failure we understood historically how the field was managed. So we took on a systematic add root cause analysis process. It's a very deliberate process. A few of the key members in town of the blade sat around. And said why did it happen in. An evidence based we couldn't make any root cause conclusion unless I can provide evidence for that particular statement we start. With the uncontrolled outflow four hundred and fifteen days was our primary effect and then why did it happen and then we kept going until we reached. Root causes so they would put it causes of already talked about it number one was the axial rupture due to external microbial corrosion. And second was unsuccessful topic of. Which within sufficient density and pump rates. Now we identified many root causes and I'm gonna present them in the next flight as part of our- root cause solutions because when we do a root cause analysis we identify. Solutions to the. Root cause and then the back from there the root causes. So the solutions are the root cause of that red identified that have already been implemented I've listed them by things that have been implemented. And things that are perhaps a I'm sure somebody's when implement that there there. There there's some some root causes that have not been implemented. It is based well integrity plan was it was essential to manage a facility to make sure incidents such as SS twenty five and other similar instance can be prevented. Risk assessment is quarter that I'm gonna go to go to a tiki once on that list that I believe it is essential second one is to bring Parker completion and will Beria. Today by law in California it's unique to California it is not true in any other place the required will better system what to do about your system and allow you to do is you're only producing to the tubing. The seven inch casing would never have been exposed to gas into the being filled with kill my door or Packer floored so an incident like this is I don't wanna say impossible highly highly improbable that that is intended that. Casing wanting this inspection so they've already done all the kissing wilderness. And the real time quotes of and that's an important one so if you see reinterpreted what happened sequence based on compressor data house in feet away from the rubble sick. White happened you can prevented another since incidents and any new wells are the second one is when you drill new wells you want a seaman surface causing to pop you can prevent that the corrosion production casing to the top. And in some cases the formation of such you cannot semen to surface casing you can have a C. P. system and prevent this any form of corrosion. So I ran through a depreciated time. Thank you. Thank you I will be following up with questions thank you doctor. And one final thing this is the report. In the main report is released on may sixteenth at their supplemental reports if you're interested in can attempt if an interesting failure analysis this excruciating detail thank you. Very good thank you thank you for the excruciating detail. We needed it and we still do. I'll I'll I deputy director Marshall your testimony and then we'll follow up with a few questions okay thank you Sir. Thank you senator the use of the woman. A great deck is up. I'm. Well a preface thank you for holding the hearing giving us the opportunity to indicate what the department has been doing in response not only to the Lisa canyon failure welfare to assist twenty five but also with regard to the blade root cause analysis report I think you see as I as I make presentation some of this material is familiar to residents here in Porter ranch to maybe some of the other members in the audience. It is by presenting again though in the context of the root cause analysis that I think you'll you'll see why I want to. Go over some of those things again. So we're going to talk a little bit about. The conference a safety review that was required. When I talk about new operating requirements regulations and then plans for subsequent regulations. So when the I SS twenty five well experience the blood then in October two thousand fifteen. We started looking at the real question of just ourselves how did you end up with gas coming out of the ground. It was very obvious to us that there must be some failure of casing we didn't have a root cause analysis to tell us that. But it was very obvious that there must be some kind of failure of casing. And so. We started even as the well was was still being attempted to control an A. as secondary. Well is being drilled for intercept. We had ordered the operator to stop injecting gas and they were trying to withdraw gas to reduce pressure in the formation during that time. But we were coming up with even as as that was all happening. A means of testing the other wells in the facility we knew that there were a hundred and thirteen other wells there the that SS twenty five and many of them shared the same. Construction vintage built in the fifties is oil and gas wells converted in the early seventies to. Gas storage wells. And so we knew that we needed to have a couple of different testing regimes. The testing regimes that had been in current regulation at the time were really what we would call it a determinative kind of test that is to say is there a leaking now and that's the kind of test that you're looking at. That's actually like a noise longer temperature log where you're trying to listen for the sound of rushing gas coming outside of a well. Or the temperature log weird gases decompressing in this cooling and giving indication again that something is that something is amiss with the casing. We knew that we needed to do that for all of the wells. SS twenty five was at the time was scheduled for annual testing of noise into blogs. It had passed that test a little less than one year prior and was due for testing. If not days and weeks after. The leak was found. So. We knew we had to do that we do that for all of the other wells in the field. And we also wanted to make sure that we did this what we call battery to testing. And this is really where we start getting into what I call predictive testing where you're now looking at. Is the cement competent using tools to measure the thickness and the bonding of the cement between the casing and the surrounding ground. The well is constructed into talking about a caliper log which is really testing to see if the- the- casing is still cylindrical. Or whether it's deformed a little bit flattened out. Ultrasonic casing inspection log magnetic flux casing inspection logs I could have a Walker or technical expert come on up and explain that but- they're basically tests to determine whether or not there's corrosion. Going on in the casing. And lastly we wanted to make sure we had pressure testing done. Of the production casing the two bins and Packers of all of those hundred and thirteen wells. Because again. We knew. Well we're in the middle of the emergency. That at some point in time. That emergency would stop. And we would need to make sure that the rest of the facility. What was not going to be. Experiencing that kind of a catastrophic failure. There we go. So we are started doing the comprehensive safety review for all of the other wells this is after we got the well was controlled in February started doing that conference a safety review and it is it is ongoing I am aware that there is a time frame that we need to get that done there's one well that is still out there that is. Quite complex with a lot of obstructions in the well bore it has taken months for them to get through we are erring on the side of safety rather than than time to make sure that gets done it is isolated as you'll see from the discussion so of the hundred and fourteen wells including SS twenty five. Sixty six wells have passed all the tests and approved for service that means they've passed both of those batteries of tests they may have they may have been found initially to a failed but they've been repaired and then tested again and passed. Forty three wells have been taken out of service by taking out of service I mean they've been plugged with cement service restoration is not yet complete but they've been published a mentor isolated from that formation one well. The one that you're referring to is isolated from the plug from the formation and the playing operations are nearly complete. And for wells have been plugged with full service restoration. And so when those when those. When those reviews were completed and we had the wells at isolated from the formation that was when the division. Was able to make the determination that that the field to go back on injection and production albeit. In limited amounts and those limited amounts were set both by dog and by the PC. So there are ongoing operational requirements that have been in effect one of them is the maximum range of what pressures being held down to twenty nine hundred. Twenty six PSI which is quite a bit lower than what so cal gas would like. We have continuous pressure monitoring required on the two beings and on the annular space of all the storage wells. Fence line air monitoring exists for methane and there are daily Fleer camera images for gas inspection for leaks at all the well sites and again the Fleer cameras looking for a decompression. Is looking for gas in the form of a temperature change. We establish new regulations as we went through this process one of the things that we did initially was to immediately it acts of emergency regulations. As you know senator of this and the woman. At mercy regulations have a lifespan of one year those emergency regulations at. Required all of those tests that I mentioned as well as other operational requirements. I think the legislature for the authorization to extend those emergency regulations Biondi here because to make the- permanent regulations effective we really needed to make sure we had time. And we didn't want to see a gap. In protection and so that was very important for us to get that dealing with the new regulations I'll go through some of the high points of them. One of them is insuring as- as the blade representative I indicated is that we don't have single points of failure. When the well was producing before through both to being and casing. Pressure was being exerted on both the tubing and the external casing. Which means that if the casing fails there is no back up. So that was a single point of failure. Under the current regulations. The only place that pressure can be exerted is inside the tubing whether it's on injection or a withdrawal the pressure can only be on the two big. If the tubing was to fail. Then the casing is there and it's not under pressure and I can act as a as a safety net or catchment. So that then the repair work can be done and you don't end up with. A failure into the subsurface into the surrounding earth. We required risk management planning I won't go through each one of these items but I'll just give you the high points of them risk management plan is required for all guest workers to lose in the state now we're talking about identification of potential threats and hazards including corrosion and that would include some of the testing that's going to be one of these are the bullets here regular mechanical integrity testing that regime of phase one and phase two testing that's required on a regular basis now different periods for different types of testing but it's required and regular basis to repeated to ensure that there aren't corrosion issues arising that. They are being observed quantitative risk assessments are required well by well risk assessments casing corrosion monitoring. And emergency response planning among those details. In addition we have monitoring requirements for all wells in casters disabilities. Monitoring of the storage was were material balance and reservoir integrity so you're talking about how much gas is being injected how much gas is being withdrawn. Immediate reporting of intended unintended gas releases chemical fingerprinting. Alarms for annulus pressure changes that's an important one again as indicated by the blood report if you seeing a change in that any other pressure it means that something has happened inside that tubing. Likely means something's happened inside the tubing. And you've got a compromise you need to take take a look at that. And then testing the safety valves every six months real time data gathering is also. Critical to successfully regulating in these facilities. One of the things is as you know no one of things that was required by both the P. you see in dog was the independent. Root cause analysis conducted by blade that focuses on technical issues and the technical because of the leak. There is a secondary root cause analysis being conducted by Dr. And that is focused entirely on compliance with other statutes and regulations we're looking at the information that we're getting from blade and all of the- the various of its data that in there. But we needed that report so that we could actually finalize our report. I don't have a date right now for you for when that will be done but with the receipt of the blade reported should be able to. Accelerate quickly to completion. So. One of the things that that I would note about the blade report is that. Now that we know what the root cause was now that we know that that it was a casing failure we know that the regulations that we adopted first as an emergency and later as a permanent regulation that those really are getting at some of those those risk points that that are identifiable by the blade report. Blade ID I think I don't know but words in their mouth and blade actually indicated that had those regulations been in place before two thousand and fifteen the ones that we have today. That we likely would have detected the weakening in that case in wall and we likely would have been able to have prevented it so I think that that's that's a good thing for the protection of public health and safety for however long we're going to have gas storage in the state and I'm not making any any judgment I understand that the PC is going to make that determination. However long we're going to have it we need to make sure that it's going to be done safely and- I think I think that those regulations got got to that there are a couple of pieces that I also want to make sure that we're clear on and one appreciate your work. Senator on S. before sixty three is it's identifying some additional places from the blade reporting giving a sum of forty to really take a look at. When do we want to make sure we put cathodic protection into these wells we need to have maintaining have and maintain individual well control plans do the calculations on the front end so you know how much blood and how much weight you're gonna need to control the well. To the you're not trying to scramble about it when you've got a blow up going. Evaluations of casing failures and near misses a past practice was to say Hey you've had a problem with as well fix it. But not to ask the question why and that needs to happen and again the chemical inventory reported so these are all areas where we're looking to update the regulations in the future we look forward as I said to making sure that if we're going to have these facilities. Let's have them safely. I thank you Mister Marshall. I had a few initial question just for Mr Krishnamoorthy before moving back to the administration. I wanted to drill a little deeper if you will. Into the into a nineteen eighty eight memo that you referred to. I'm looking at page a hundred seventy four of your root cause analysis looking at the candidate wells for casing inspection the twenty flagged wells identified then by the gas company. Let me get this straight so back then it in nineteen eighty eight they flagged fifty candidate well as for casing inspection. Twenty I believe I'm sorry Sir twenty well as for casing inspection. They inspected only five the inspected seven they inspected seven and found five that had correct evidence of corrosion external corrosion yes external corrosion of a microbial nature no they didn't know that was that it was indeterminism determined to stop at that point yeah. I believe data pad some of them they understood their work I think they were planned and then they stopped is there evidence of their repair. I believe that is right there yes evidence of the repair of the five yeah for a couple of them out of the five right. Yes I'm in. The two of the remaining seven that did not have the external corrosion did not have external corrosion correct the remaining thirteen wells. Flagged for casing inspection. Is there any evidence in the record of the gas company actually inspecting those wells. I don't believe now I don't believe any of them and inspected. And in your opinion as a standard industry practice. Is there any reason that they should not have inspected the remaining thirteen okay is so let me go back we went back to say why he they first identified the twenty. And they had it delivered ability there to prioritize Isshin be identified SS twenty five for example is a low priority in that list. So they did all the high priorities and perhaps one or two medium priorities and they ignored the rest some medium and some low. So that was a lot there was a logic at that point but even among the high and medium priority of the twenty. Of which SS twenty five was not one of them they still didn't even complete. That full list of the twenty they only got to seven out of that one perfect and ignored thirteen. Yeah they they it was quite productive those days but yes yes. But SS twenty five which was a low priority the time was not even inspected. Nor was any corrosion detected because there was no inspection correct an inmate at what a what we mean by inspection there. Is going to pull the tubing. And then you run wall thickness of inspection tools that. Jason had here a few minutes ago. One of those two if you have to run we're we're the majority of those wells vintage wells another were guided weapons that are from former oil production correct they're all former world about. And was SS twenty five also a former oil well correct from right what was but it still didn't make their list. For candidate wells for some unknown reason. Thank you for that and I wanted to also get your input on what happened what you think happened between two PM on October twenty second when you you alluded to a slight decrease in pressure and three AM on October twenty third when you said that there was a detection I think you use the word that they smelled it what happened in your opinion between that. And the thirteen hours okay let me make goes to back a little bit on October twenty second. Two PM they shut the railing okay and there was no issues at that point you look at the pressure record looks clean. Then at three oh forty M. shut the world down at at two PM bishop injection to the well they said and gestured to the one that is that is standard practice yeah many of those turn it on and off in order to turn it on it so they turned it off turn it off of that. Yeah and they shut it. And so then you fast forward to three to four AM on October twenty third yes they started re injecting gas at that point. So what we've after is we know that between October twenty second two PM on October twenty third. Three AM roughly twelve hours at. Twelve fourteen hours there was no there the S. S. S. twenty five not it failed. That is what we went after. So then. October twenty third three to four AM we believe. The food axial that long failure happen sometime after that. And we think the circumferential parting because it looked cord happen at around seven or eight AM on October twenty third morning. So if I go back from that it was probably an hour before the doctor happened did detect the smell the gas only at three PM on October twenty third okay so I want to clarify the time line. Understood yeah. And so. This nineteen eighty eight memo. Internally was ident flag those twenty wells. Five out of six seven were inspected five found external corrosion. No further inspections were done. Between nineteen eighty eight and present day. I want to kind of paraphrase that in twenty fourteen when they did the G. R. C. testimony that generate cages him like you do these opportunities PCS. They at that point they flagged some bells that they had identified external corrosion okay only way you can flag you have external corrosion is on the casing is you have to run along one of these wall thickness logs so they did do some inspections and now I don't believe they read the other thirteen I I'll need to check my report again to confirm that. But there are some other wells and we looked at those wells also their identified some. Other routes and some of them had external corrosion formally so twenty six years after that initial memo they flagged a few more wells. Yeah sometime in that Peter twenty eleven twenty two a limit that inspection and yet the thirteen we still don't have evidence in the record whether they even finish that old. List no there would have been as part of the post of to the battery of tests I'm sure that was covered I don't have that in my family but the show we don't necessarily have correlated that. Thirteen from the list of twenty two that twenty fourteen testimony. We have we have that I have to go back and look at my records. Mrs tone but I can find it but the- at that time in the twenty fourteen report. I'm sorry the twenty fourteen testimony was SS twenty five flag. No it was not not. Twenty four was not flat. Because there was. A again their regulation in the practice was to run noise and temperature logs. Annual temperature logs which was run on this is twenty five every year. He does run. There was no indications of any leaks or anything. No indication of any leaks but is microbial corrosion a standard type of corrosion that occurs to wells especially and former oil fields. It's the day of the mechanism here is a bit unusual in SS twenty five but independent of how the corrosion happens. If you inspect the well he was he corrosion. So the inspection doesn't. Doesn't necessarily tell me what mechanism it is. But inspection tells you I lost some Wall. Street Richard immediately tell her. So if they had inspected but. In those twenty six years they would have found something. Likely that's most absolutely most probably they should fund yeah because it was expensive corrosion. From six hundred feet to below to nine ninety or thousand twenty five feet it was external corrosion on the seven inch casing. And is it foreseeable that that well that is more than twenty six years old I believe goes back to the nineteen fifties that it would experience some corrosion overtime. Need not to see that's the problem you you it depends on how to see men Ted. Depends on where the that surface casing shoe is set. So the lawn of factors so you could have an order I'll have no corrosion. All you could have a new well that'll have corrosion so it is not an age dependent it's dependent on the architecture dependent on. What I architecture versus twenty five I believe you said they used cement case cement at the bottom. But drilling muds for the remainder of the well all the way up to the surface so in that kind of formation. Is microbial corrosion a foreseeable risk external corrosion is a foreseeable risk I wouldn't say microbial. But external and internal corrosion as a foreseeable risk. And that they have a lot of data on. Today so I want to move to the department of conservation briefly so I understand that you said your investigation is still under way of your root cause analysis investigation busy phase two of this root cause not the technical route because- and you you mentioned that you were looking at their compliance. With statutes and regulations yes that's correct are you solely looking at compliance with statutes and regulations are you also looking at standards. And practices that go beyond whatever regulations around the books at the time yes generally speaking what we would be looking at is what. What the prior regulation spoke to of good oil field practice so that the broad terms of we look to find that there's something that they could and should have been done ordinarily even if it's not spelled out that shell test. With this with this frequency we'll be looking at that. And based on your review of the current blade energy partners report do you think that the process we sound to establish the report the techniques used is the department S. at least supportive of the process for developing this technical root cause analysis I believe the department is up al Walker is here are technically and I think I would concur that that the report would meet our expectations of technical so I'm seeing a yes from Mister Walker and I'll I'll take that as a yes from you. So if the process was sound have you do you agree with the conclusions. Yes and so. When can we expect this investigation to be completed of sort of phase two of this root cause analysis. I'm I'm sorry I don't have a hard date for that center one of the things that we're making sure we do for the integrity of that analysis is the people who are doing it are walled off from from other parts of the organization it's a we don't inquire of them or or try to influence their investigation any way shape or form so I will get an answer for you as to what their expectations of time one how does the walling work. There's a specific unit within dog or it's a it's a compliance unit it's generally tasked with things like doing assessments of whether programs are being implemented appropriately across the organization that team was tasked with with. Setting up this is even while the. Well the well was still I blowing out. They were tester Leon with with doing their work and doing it independently so they did not report to. To me or to al Walker on the response team they reported to a different a different line of command. And what is that line of the command who who do they report to at that time it would have been actually to supervisor can harass. Former supervisor can harass and can was out of the- the chain as you noted from the response. Alan I became the lead on the response for further so canyon and other operations of doctor where the of the willing as supervisors responsibility. So did did then supervisor Harris as he had a hand in developing this secondary root cause analysis I believe that it's been entirely done by the staff in that compliance is solely by the staff not by then supervisor careers. I know we've had issues. That have emerged around conflicts of interest within the division of oil gas and geothermal recovery. And that supervisor Harris's been relieved of his duty as a result. But my question for you is it Hey have you were now is the acting supervisor have you assessed any potential conflicts of interest within this staff conducting this final phase of the root cause analysis is there some way to ascertain. Whether they have any stock or financial interests in oil and gas in any way shape or form yes we've accused all of the staff who had any any hint of interest and energy issues not just oil and gas but energy issues we've had all of them accused from any regulating inspecting. Oversight of oil and gas operations and that's been ongoing since day one of my acting role. At the that something will be following up on subsequently through this committee and we'll look forward to future conversations about how to. Rebuild trust with Dogger in. Taking us another look at. The mission of dog. Vision of oil gas and geothermal recovery is currently the name of the agency it is an agency in my view that the statute has mistakenly assigned with the mission of recovering oil and gas and that that has been the mission up to this point. Because they're within the department of conservation there is legislation. And possible you know. On the fossa with the passive on the fossil fuel industry while we have this dependence on that form of energy. Do you think that doctors mission needs to be updated. I think there have I think everybody would agree that dog you're at as a regulatory regulatory agency can continue to improve. I will say you know with the center Pavel is leadership on as before with legislative leadership with governor brown's leadership. A lot has improved a dog it now actually has a strong regulatory enforcement program. As we talked about here today it's passed to some of the strongest regulations in the country but absolutely we have to do more and we will. When I heard the from doctor Krishnamoorthy an apology is Ravi but your doctor here. There are certain risks that simply cannot be mitigated when it comes to oil and gas. And is strong is daughters new regulations may be and we may pass subsequent legislation requiring. More additional cathartic pressed protections and other pressure testing and other failure analyses. Corrosion happens that's just what happens with the well. So. How what what what guarantee can we give to the people who live here in the San Fernando Valley that there will never be another blow out or leak ever again here at this field. Well listen I think you've asked a question broadly about the you know risk factors of fossil fuel and I think you heard me validate what you open that the hearing with which is where all collectively working to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel. At the same time it's a transition. You know as I understand it over nine million people in the base and get natural gas at least partially from this facility. And reasonable people can argue about its its centrality to the supply of that natural gas. But come this winter Angelenos will have their homes heated with natural gas in the cook tonight with natural gas. I took a lift here it was not electric vehicle it uses gas. I and so the question is how to we continue to utilize fossil fuels in the safest way possible. With as smaller carbon footprint as possible until we can actually involve not to reduce our dependence and move on to a D. carbonized economy. So I guess. I would just ask do you have a position. Did the governor is made public commitments and private commitments to the people in this room myself and in public on the closure of a lease can and is that a line with. The agency's policy. I'll be straightforward which is the C. P. U. C. which has a responsibility to ensure safety and reliability of energy. Is right now engaged in a public process to determine there you know whether Lee so canyon is necessary. In our system and I respect that process and we need to what we need to see that process play out. An so folks folks I hear you I hear you all. We may bring you all back up in a second but my final question was. There are still wells they're on a casing failure map fact from nineteen eighty eight that have also been noted in twenty fourteen testimony to the public utilities commission that maze have the same risks that SS twenty five did is that correct Debbie director Marshall. Any of the wells that were identified in in prior years as having corrosion issues or potential defects. If they are not already plugged in an abandoned are you one of the forties. I want to make sure I don't misstate the numbers one of the forty four I believe it was. Wells that means that they have been repaired and they have been able to pass the battery of tests that determined that that there isn't a corrosion problem. In the casing that that has been had been fixed. But doctor Krishnamoorthy said that there can still be corrosion not from within the casing but externally even on. The wells that are determined to have integrity internally is that correct that is correct and the testing regime that we are putting these wells through text corrosion both internally and externally so. So if. If new construction had had a repair work had been done on wells and overtime corrosion begins to occur. Then subsequent testing will identify that and direct work again the predictive nature of the what we call the battery to testing is. Really important to us so how many of the identified wells have not yet been plugged in a band in. There is he said forty three have been plugged there are many how many are there still to go sixty six wells have passed all the tests and are approved for service. Forty three wells taken out of service employed with cement but there's surface restoration that still needs to be done. For wells so that's up to forty seven have been plugged in with full service restoration and there is one more that is being clogged so that will take it up to a total of forty eight when that one is complete. And when will those remaining five the four that have been plugged in the one that is being plugged when do you expect those to be. Abandoned I'm sorry I think I would it makes those up the four walls that have been plugged with full service restoration no for the work will be needed on this okay it's the- the forty three was taken out of service plugged with cement but the service restoration still needs to be completed on the one. Other isolated from the formation and needs to have the plugin completed those forty four. I'd ask Alice el do you have any indication on the time line for those. I Mister Harris your welcome to just. If you don't mind I'm sorry thank you Sir it's okay a Walker a technical. Lead on those yes. Mister Walker. Thank you Sir okay yeah on its own Walker from the division of oil gas and geothermal resources. There's one well. It's the ward three wealth that they've had to side track. They've spent about twenty million dollars on that well at this point in time. And they appears to me that that's probably going to be. Finally plugged in abandoned without service restoration. By the end of August and can you do what does that mean when you plug in a band without surface restoration. That means they haven't gone back and recreated the surface to the condition it was. Before they installed the well site. So it's so surface integrity in other words if there would be thank you would look like nothing ever happened that's right and so what will it look like if you do not restore it to its going to look like the well sites that you have now. Except it's gonna be cut off below the surface and then fill back in with the- or cement. Changes it'll be a flat spot on the side of the hill and that twenty million that you're saying for. I'm sorry towards three in ordering that and that that's where the plucking is still under way but not yet complete that's right. Where exactly where abouts in the field is that. Give a sense I don't have since okay. But it is a so cal gas well caresses at and so. What what is that you alluded to twenty million what what does that refer to that's how much they spent in order to properly plugin abandoned at well. And so they've been unsuccessful with that expenditure and those efforts why well it's been it's been a very problematic well because there was. There were some mechanical of problems in the well they had to essentially do very much like what they did with the lease of canyon or with SS twenty five. Which is the come out of the wellbore side track and then come back into the well war. Re intercept and then pump the cement into the well through that would that matter. And so that those efforts have not been successful. At this point they're almost done at this point. So is there any risk of blow out or leak in the interim period. No it's plugged with cement okay across all perforations and they're in the process of plugging back the intercept well. So there the remaining work to be done is to seal it for good but the plugging is already occurred. The plugging in the interval where the gas could be produced in the cap rock has been completed and now they're working their way up the will work to. Ensure there's- no possibility of contamination of ground water and stuff like that understood and those those dollars that are being expended right now by the gas company that twenty million in addition to the many other. Millions of dollars they've spent in this plugging in abandoning process for the. Sixty six wells that have passed the forty three that. Have been. Plugged the remaining. For and then this one for ward three. Those those are all be accounted for by the administration I believe by doggerel by the public utilities commission and being that they're not automatically being passed through to rate payers correct is that is that part of the accounting process we wouldn't keep track of how much they're spending on that we said we set the requirement for making sure the plugin gets done properly. But I believe that I defer to the P. C. L. to whether they're taking those dollar amounts okay thank you do you mind. Sir just commenting thank you Mister Walker Preciado it there I know there is a sort of a running account of all expenditures related to a lease so canyon the response recovery and then the clean up is that are these kinds of costs being. Accounted for. Yes it's been accounted for and energy division it's an involved in that they're tracking it. My section to see can enforcement. Does not have a dozen track that under budget again did you division has. And so even though I don't want you to speak for the energy division those costs are not being automatically passed through to ratepayers at this point. They're being set aside. To be Frank I don't know the status of those okay my colleagues had the energy division was speak. Correctly about days I have them okay. Would you mind getting back to the committee or or asking Mister Randolph for someone at the energy division to let us know. I will certainly do that my thank you I might my into my understanding is that all costs associated. Are being tallied Natchez Talbert set aside and then. The decision about whether they will be passed through to rate payers will be highly dependent on some of these I eyes but- I'd appreciate that feedback. I will follow up thank you Sir thank at this point. So member Smith I know this was this panel was sort of the- jurisdiction of our committee so up thank you for the indulgence of letting me. Go deep here but did you have any in into additional comments. No it is I have a comment that actually ends up being an observation for the portion that I'm going to get to later news for first panel. Spoke about the need for from the beginning of the root cause analysis through then what were the remediation plans for the site the facility. The importance of data. And the importance of the fact that the initial data that was captured and collected with an undisturbed site from the time of the blow out all the way through this process has been significantly important in promoting. Public health and safety and I want us to keep that in mind the significance of having a clean data set when it comes to protecting the public's health. All right. If you don't mind sticking around in case there are some further questions but we're gonna move on to the next panel thank you Mister secretary deputy director. Dr Krishnamoorthy for all your work. Thank you all. Next we're gonna call up. We're gonna call up bread lane the chief executive officer of southern California gas company. Brianna morning the senior scientist of Lyndon wildlife and climate programs at the natural resources defense council and then. Dr Matt Matthew D. Alessio from cal state university Northridge. I think we've got yes. How don't worry. Thank you for your patience and your indulgence here we know you all have very busy schedules and- I think the whole community appreciates. Your patience. My first question. Was for the CEO of the gas company. But they're not here. I don't know what they have to hide. Or why they wouldn't be willing to testify at hearing like this we do know that there is an immense amount of litigation against the company at this point. And so there may have been some legal risk to a public testimony at this point. But you can. Rest assured that this committee. Will be following up. With Mister lane as well as Sempra soliciting documents that we feel are in the public interest including documents that are. Currently pending in discovery and class action another nuisance and negligence litigation that we feel deserve to be publicly disclosed. So in the weeks ahead you can expect a letter to be forthcoming to the CEO of the gas company and- I would invite. Our press and our public to offer us their input as well so that we can maximize the scrutiny that is well deserved on Mister lane and the entire company as to what they intend to do to make this right and I can tell you sending twenty five million dollars to a bunch of Terry di gestures in the Central Valley does not make this right. So. I'm going to start off with. Ms the doctor Mordecai I'm sorry. So our our senior scientist here with the naturist or defense counsel because we're we're a little short on time we're gonna ask you to limit each of your testimony to ten minutes and then we can follow up with questions if that's acceptable so please miss more to proceed and then we'll move to doctor dilisio thank you so much great thank you yeah thank you for having me here today and I'm specially when I think. Of the community members for being here and sharing their experiences of what it was like to actually live through this because obviously all the dry facts and figures that we're presenting here today can't capture that the lease canyon the four month leak at the least cannon underground natural gas storage facility was environmental and public health disaster. And as we've heard in vivid detail here today it's an ongoing disaster for the people who live in this community as the root cause analysis reveals longstanding flaws and inadequacies in the regulation of regulation and oversight of these facilities was a primary contributing factor to the events that occurred. Through some of the efforts of a senator stern and others and legislation the division is taken significant steps to correct the shortcomings but more work remains to be done and ultimately the adequacy of these changes. Can only be judged on the basis of future performance. US I'm gonna go through some of the- root causes that played identified some of are discussed and their proposed solutions. Their analysis of whether those solutions are addressed by the current regulation. And then at my individual analysis of whether I think that is indeed correct and whether the relic regulations do address those issues. So I wanna be clear that I'm I'm not calling into question any of the technical expertise of blade or any of their technical analysis. You know to the extent that my analysis of the adequacy of daughters rules. Differs from blades I believe that reflects more of a difference in expectations about tried transparency. What's necessary to turn the words printed in these regulations and actual results in the field. And possibly a difference and risk tolerance. So the first route because as we have all learned the- way that the well was designed completed and maintained led to corrosion on the backside of the casing the outside of the casing which eventually led to rupture and a leak. Blades proposed solution to this is that cement should be production casings should be submitted to service there should not be gaps behind. The production casing as they- discovered on this is not currently required by doctors either does or existing or- new regulations the dog rule in the gas or just simply says the intermediate production casings. If they're not similar to surface have to be submitted in accordance with some existing requirements which also do not require some meaning to surface. Also this is an area that remains on a dress and in which action is needed. Doctors actually in the process of going through a wall construction rule making so long standing need to update their well construction rules. For all oil and gas wells so be one way that they could address that or they could go through a separate rule making to require this. But it's important to note the cementing to service can only be applied to new wells not to the hundreds of existing wells that are already being used for a gas storage. Given that you know gas storage is likely only to be occurring in the existing fields and not the new fields. This will not address the existing wells which- is obviously an issue that the rules do not specifically include requirements for what you should have to do to convert an existing well like the SS twenty five. That was not built for purpose to a gas storage. Well and we think that's a shortcoming of the rules. Art so. One of the other root causes that was identified by played was the lack of regulations. Requiring corrosion detection election of corrosion detection is. Employed by it so cal gas. Their solution recommend solution is that regulation should require wall thickness inspection. They concluded that this. Is indeed addressed by daughters latest regulations. I agree that is partly address but eight think that their rules could do more. Daughters rules require casing wall thickness thickness inspections at least once every two years. Those results that have to be compared to each other to determine a corrosion rate. Based on that determine corrosion rate they have to take action if it's a suspected that Lee could occur. But there's also a variance in this rule which says that last few frequent expects inspection could be approved. Based on the results of the test. At we think this is an adequate there is also a big detailed requirement in the risk management plan for them to develop a casing inspection. And corrosion plan we think those these. Two requirements need to be working together more explicitly. And also we don't think it's appropriate to allow variance in the testing you can't find problems that you're not looking for. In the. The management plan. It is indeed address by dockers regulations which requires a pretty significant development of a pretty significant risk management plan. But you know in addition to that obviously. You know. The well I'll say the risk manager regulations are pretty comprehensive they're technically sound. And they are largely performance based. Now performance based regulations can have advantages among those are that. They consider site specific conditions and risks I have the disadvantage of performance based requirements as aid by definition. Lack prescriptive standards and it can be there for difficult to objectively assess their adequacy. So say for example a prescriptive standard would say cement the production casing to surface it's very easy to determine. Whether production casing has or has not been submitted to surface. A performance based standard would say cement your production casing in such a way that prevents the movement of fluids behind the casing. It may achieve the same goal but it's more difficult to objectively analyze that that's not to say the performance based regulation should be use actually can be very important. But one way to help reduce some of the ambiguity is to develop detailed guidance which sets very clear expectations for the elements that should be included in the risk management plan. I think that's something darker should do. Also think it's critical. Stop the leak they either didn't possessor didn't apply the knowledge necessary to stop the leak when it could have been. So even expert sometimes don't have all of the answers getting more input from other experts and I would be important step. Here again casing corrosion was a big part of the root cause of the leak. And blade found that you know they were really addressing those problems re actively they weren't being proactive as the recommended solution was to conduct a casing corrosion study they determined that the regulations do indeed address this. I concur with their finding the risk management plan includes pretty comprehensive requirements to develop a corrosion monitoring evaluation and mitigation standard. But again I would say that that also needs to have a public notice and comment process associated with it public should have an opportunity to weigh in on the development of those plans. And again doctor should issue guidance for anything that's a performance based regulation they need to provide some more road markers so that other people can more objectively. Assess whether those regulations are being met. See so the- they also found that failure analysis had not been provided or had not been conducted proactively us again blade solution was that they should be conducting a casing failure analysis their analysis was that is not specifically addressed by regulation but it would be expected to be a part of the risk management plan and I think you know I concur with that but I think a solution pretty obviously is to just make that explicit there should be no question that that should be a part of the regulations that could potentially. Be accomplish their guidance or through a new rule making and again as with the others there should be a public input process into all of these. The sea so again another route because- that played at identified was the- the lack of well specific detail well controlled plans. Which extended the time that it took to do the well kill. Their solution of course obviously is to include weld specific and detailed well control plans and their assessment was it that it is addressed by regulations. My assessment is that it potentially could be included in the emergency response plan requirements but I don't think it's- necessarily explicit. So I think that would be another at potential improvement is that this should be explicitly required. Again that should also be subject to public comment and notice and I have guidance developed. They also. Identified as one of the root causes obviously they'll the single use of a single barrier the recommended solution is to use a tubing and Packer completion do barrier system this is a critical one because I actually think there's been a little bit of misinformation today about whether this is actually required. Laid analysis is that yes this is required. Duggars rules do not explicitly require the use of tubing they require that wells are construction will both a primary and secondary mechanical well barriers but they do not explicitly required to being set on a Packer. In this is confirmed by the fact that in numerous other places throughout the well it's as if to being is use. Now having the requirement for having both primary and secondary well barriers is very important again it's a little bit more of a performance based goals. But I think it should be expressly required to inject her to be on a Packer and the reason is that. To being can readily be replaced and removed from the well it's not permanently affixed in the well. If you're using casings cemented casing that's much more difficult to remove and patching casing repairing casing is not always as successful so I would say that. Explicitly requiring injection and withdrawal to occur only thru tubing sat on a Packer. Should be part of requirements. I and finally I just wanna know that obviously this is only one of many gas storage fields in California. Many of which were discovered and began operating around the same time as a lease canyon. These all present risks these all need to be brought up to the modern standards that have been adopted. Part of the rules require that the risk management plans and emergency response plans we made public. I'm not aware that those have been made public yet but you know I think I know update from dog or on the status of where it stands to bring all of these fields into compliance. With the new regulations that would be very useful. And so I'll leave it there. Thank you. Thank you miss more Dick doctor less you. NASA have some slides here if you can get those up for us. So we're gonna sort of change gears a little bit we've been talking not to diminish the root the root cause analysis but Richler shortly before that came out there was another report that came out and posted on doctors website which is the draft seismic hazard analysis and I wanted to. To discuss that in order to make sure we have a little bit of context I wanted to remind us where we are here we are of course in. The southern California where we've got these two plates crashing together and the hills that are behind Porter ranch for the so caring is located they are being pushed off constantly and thing crust up along the sentences in a false system and that runs along the base of. These mountains so we know that this false system exists because of course when we slice through the earth. I do that here. All of the wells Italy so canyon actually cut through that and we have well log that show us where those where those faults are crossing through the wells so we know that this is a this is an issue. CGS the crates maps of different types of hazards the minister's skip over this but to show to show you this is a picture of the relevant area with those different colors showing different types of hazards. And you course see that there are colors everywhere the yellow area there is the fault rupture hazard which means that if you were to try to build a development or a hospital or a school in there because this is an area where to size the fault might slip. And might rip apart your structure you would actually have to do special studies to do that we currently have no such regulations for one S. A. structure crosses a fault in the subsurface is only about the service and in fact this yellow area here. Is where the nineteen seventy one San Fernando earthquake ruptured also we know that that area is in fact well mapped because that's where the fault is. And the only reason that there's no mapping over here on the left side is because nobody lived there and it didn't seem to be relevant or important for us to map in that particular area at the time but of course. Well the collapsed in the nineteen ninety four earthquake that so cal gas documented in the risk management plan I don't know any details about it they didn't provide any of the of what at details about what happened. Clearly not a major calamity or we would have heard about it but these there are some hazards associated with earthquakes in this field. How big earthquake are briefly I just the expected magnitude as a progeny magnitude seven point three which- is about eight times the energy release of the nineteen ninety four. For Northridge earthquake so a very large earthquake could happen here. With that in mind so cal gas was mandated to. Produce a seismic report by some independent now. Independent agencies. And they did a very detailed study actually want it when I commend them for the study it's and are there not there the study's authors not here like blade was to for us to thank us for doing an ice independent job. But they went through step by step they looked at where the faults. How big the earthquakes be on those faults if we have an earthquake on not fault what's it going to do to the to the- to the wells. If they start leaking. How much could they leak and once that gas leaks out into the rock. How much is going to reach the service they did step by step they have a thick ten different. Parts to this report to each one's a couple hundred pages the work of several scientists for a couple months probably. This is comprehensive. On briefly to show you the short answer the conclusions. Faults I already told you that all the- faults are cut by all the all the wells are cut by active fault. We also know two expected earthquakes neither of those things were new. On the well if you build a well across a fault and it moves several feet. You should expected to rip apart. That's. Also perhaps not landmark it'll show you some pictures in a moment. Some of the gas that breaks out will actually remain trapped underground and they did some detailed modeling it'll tell you about. And in the worst case this was done when there were sixty two active well save since brought a few more online we heard about that I guess are to sixty six or something. So I'm I'm stuck in the past of met early may for this but at the time they were at estimating sixty two wells. Leaking simultaneously. So let's look at some of those things in more detail. Re flee they they had parts this report the covered all these different types of hazards. I'm gonna focus on fault rupture because that's the one that actually makes a difference. For us. For ground shaking they sort of shows seven wells might leak and a and a pretty strong earthquake so that's not a- huge concern compared to fault rupture. Landslides a very detailed report but it ends with this vague conclusion that. Only a few wells. Are very on unscientific. And liquefaction not relevant for this area there's and there's no hazard from that so. We're gonna focus in on fault rupture. And we do talk about here I've got I've got my old visual aid here. So imagine. You have things are connected. And they're going to move. Well how much do they move and that's the first thing they wanted to figure out and- they've got here probabilities. There's about a 10% chance. That the fall will moved. Six inches. Doesn't sound like a lot I remember looking at a seven inch diameter pipes to six inches is getting to be substantial. That's a 10% chance next fifty years. It could be larger. I had my button there's a 5% chance that it could be about two and a half feet and this is a picture from the recent ridgecrest earthquake I think this is a little bit more than two and a half feet here but- imagine your little seven inch. Well being offset by that. And then lastly. There's a 2% chance that it could be as large as eight feet this is a classic picture from the nineteen oh six earthquake. Of offense the got offset by say about eight feet and you can imagine that instead of being a fence being a pipeline carrying gas. It comes to A. abrupt and somewhere in the middle and that gas is going to leak out. We've already talked about the straw within a straw you've seen pictures like this. This is the two layers of protection here's a picture of what those pipes actually look like when they're at the surface. So we do have those two layers of containment. But to there's a containment don't do you any good if both of those lawyers are ripped apart. And this is pictures from what they actually they actually took. Models of those pipes and took them into a laboratory and- expose them to sample earthquakes. And look to see what happened. And the- outer casing broken every time that they did this it's very brittle. On a visit to being a little bit more flexible. And it. Bent sometimes like you see here. Broke other times. But in sixteen of the eighteen cases including ones were bad. It sprung leaks in it. Releasing gas into their so basically both layers. Of protection were were were compromised. At this point I want to highlight to you a- how important it is to an independent analysis. So cal gas submitted the risk management plan two thousand seventeen and they gave us this quote that. It doesn't normally week. When you have this sort of offset and they offered us no evidence of that but of course when they actually had these independent labs go in and test this out. It to be leaked in sixteen of eighteen cases I think we can conclude that normally it actually does leak by varying amounts. So just briefly how to help they actually do some calculations here. When we have six inches of slip that 10% chance earth quake will get about 40% of our sorry forty of the sixty two wells with a failed. Forty eight of them would where would fail if we had a bigger earthquake and if you get this monster earthquake. All sixty two the wells will fail. So what happens that arm. This is all happening miles down is kind of a slice through the earth that shows you fifteen statues of liberty tall here and all these rocks the good news is that these rocks have successfully kept oil and gas traps for millions of years so it's not a foregone conclusion that the gas will go up to the surface there are a couple different pathways that it could get up there by. One is along the outside of the casing especially if it's not cemented it or if it's poorly cemented that's a pathway you can have and then along the fault itself and the authors of the study did a very good job and looked at these two paths possible pathways are they did. A simulation where they looked at thousands of an actually hundreds of thousands of different possible assumptions is the rock this easy to flow through or is it this easy to flow through and I tried all sorts of combinations is there and hundreds of thousands of them and they found that. In many cases there's no gas for the service but of course the beauty of this isn't science is that they can quantify the uncertainty they can tell us how many of the cases and so here are the results if we had just one well fail this is the first thing that they looked at and one of the reports. The middle of the road case had. Point oh one the point one million cubic feet per day of leakage which compared to the SS twenty five blow out. Which I didn't have the root cause analysis at the time of year I gave you I got the number should be ninety three here at peak but we had about eighty was the estimate before that. So this is this is relatively tiny not as much of a concern. But if I were to tell you that there's a 50% chance in an earthquake that you're gonna be fine. You want to know about the other 50% and happily the study's authors have quantified this for us they tell us that in. 10% of the cases. The flow rate is worse than. Ten million cubic feet per day. Which is again smaller than SS twenty five. But the slide I will warn you is basically irrelevant because we're not expecting a single thought to fail. Or sorry singled out to fail we're expecting. All sixty two of them and when that happens. The study authors did a good job again they ran a simulation of. All sixty two wells failing it. And that middle of the road case again. Is not. Hugely concerning. It's much smaller than the SS twenty five blowout. But we do have the situation where 10% of the cases that they ran. Have something that is something like if I had my by near about three times the flow rate. From the SS twenty five blowout. And cumulatively. Eight times more emissions of methane over there the lifetime of five years they ran their simulation so this could be. Quite a bit larger. I also want to point out that something that's important for us that our effort if our doctor friends are still here in terms of the future of things. On their draft report had had a flaw in it that I wanted to point out and I and I did to doctor. That they use all of the measurements of the rock. Here that we're all from before the earthquake. And how easy is it for gas to flow through there. With our measurements right now. But we know that in an earthquake yeah. Earthquakes loosen up old fractures create new ones. And oil and gas will flow up more easily affect the permeability is ten to a hundred times higher than the pre earthquake values and they used. The pre earthquake values so when they tell you that it's- you know. it's going to. Release this verse case scenario it actually could be much more likely and we need to keep that in mind. I shut down the water with doctor dated may fifth they wrote me back a month later saying my comments are gonna be considered I'm gonna take them at their at their word for that because- they actually did do a very good job and it's a- detailed comments. Before they issue the seismic study and- all those things have been addressed in the seismic study they've done a very good job of listening. And not so I want to give them some credit for getting it. This is a seismic study to be so comprehensive. It does need some more work. From here. So strong summary worst case scenario. Eight times the missions of the twenty fifteen blowout. And they need to revise their model to provide you an actor probability of. How likely is that worst case scenario. If we just look at the report at face value. I can tell you that there's a 5% chance of a large of a sufficiently large earthquake in the next fifty years of that happening. And if that earthquake happens there's at least a 10% chance that this worst case scenario becomes a reality. And that sort of where we're left but like I said I would I would like. Them to give us a more accurate view of what those probabilities really are. Thank you. Thank you doctor dealers you for scaring. Everyone in the room with very sober science. Not a scare tactic by any means but accurate modeling and independent science I think as we've seen today from both doctor Krishnamoorthy yourself miss more Dick is really. The primary backstop we as a public. Have because in our with our limited committee staff and the work we're able to do here in the legislature the onus is huge so without your efforts. We would be out we would be lost so thank you. I wanted to ask. Yeah I don't know if doctor Krishnamoorthy is still here actually do you mind. So in the event of a. Of a size make a seismic event like the one Dr Alessio outlined and they it would take because the rupture of the casing and tubing below ground I'm is there anything the field operator can actually do to prevent that gas from from completely emptying into the air and into our community. We love to study that because I don't have a quick answer for that we've asked that question of the veteran are also it's something we need to think about I don't have an immediate answer. But I'm I would like to look at it reservist had it a little bit this is not a I recognize the possibility there off of massive massive shearing off sure val-d'or and down. Some of the men friends some of them on for and so is it fair to say though that the kill techniques that were both used by boots and coots as well as some of the techniques that you felt would have maybe been more reasonable under those circumstances none of those techniques would would work in the case that there was a total rupture. Fracture of the tubing casing it some other method would have to be devised the conventional kill technique may not work because you don't have access to the World War but to me it really felt like work so there are there are ways to do this but that's why I don't want to. Really felt maybe an option to maybe some other options but a conventional just pumping fluid but we talked about yeah but pretty new territory when it comes to on it well emergency response efforts would you say I don't know that that's all I can look at it and I can get back to you okay we can we can look at it and we can we can circle back okay I'm not convinced that isn't any work done on it but- I'm I'm not a big deal okay. Thank you at and I don't know if. It Dogger at Mister Marshall just. Apologies but eight what one follow up question there though was. The seismic analysis I forget the exact name in statute or what you you what you all called it it was your seismic risk analysis yes yes I would risk analysis so. That's. What gets done in terms of emergency response plan. Relative to the facility we have received comments from doctor let's see. And we're in the process right now reviewing that reporters ourselves we've got the California Geological Survey doing a review of that they actually asked me today to make sure I extend an invitation to doctor listening to come join them on the on the review of that. With the national labs but the point of that that that analysis is really as I view it to inform. What are we going to require in terms of emergency response planning relative to the facility understanding how much movements going to Kerr what is the probability of. Of rupture of wells what is the probability of rupture and see sharing and ceiling versus sharing and leaving open to. Again doctor Lester said. Transport of gas but a fault plane versus up of outside of it well casing were even inside of a well casing. Those are considerations that we've got to figure out and get right. We ourselves internally C. G. S. looking at the work that was done by the consultant. Have have some concerns about some of the qualifications of the people in terms of. Not to put too fine a point on it licensure in California to practice geology. Other elements that we really want to make sure we get right so that we can. Make sure that the operator provides us with an emergency plan. That addresses the real the high probability issues. And the and the analyst of the consultants you're referring to are the internal folks I retained by the gas company to do their their emergency response plans the gas company did the- skinny that had the seismic review commission. We're now reviewing it they have to prepare their own it plan. For emergency response we have to review it and be okay with it. And so we're we're wanting to make sure that these pieces the size. Valuation is then well reflected in that emergency response understood so this. Undecided excerpt that doctor DLS you gave us to. Buy I forget the exact phrasing normally does not. That's the kind of. Sort of presumption that you'll be kicking the tires on as an agency absolutely okay thank you Sir. Summers Smith did you did you have any other comments for doctor dealers you had one more for me is more tech but I turn it back to what we're on the topic. The one other thing I just I what I wanted to go to identify here. Talked about some of the potential inadequacies in the lack of detail in the a risk management think the lack of guidance in sort of. In in a number of the aspects of the regulations were sort of left potentially to the discretion either of the regulator or the regulated it so. As well as sort of disclosure issues. Do you think they that there's a story under existing law. To enact those sort of more rigorous requirements or do you think there would need to be a change in statute potentially. This statute allow them the agency to undertake that the sort of more rigorous regulation. Well not a lawyer but I would yes I would assume presume that it does yes I don't think there's certainly anything that would prevent them from from being as protective as they want to be in. My supposition based on the comments from secretary crowfoot earlier is that. It sounds like we have a willing partner to work. With us. As well as within the agency I've heard them specifically reference Senate bill four sixty three which is in the Appropriations Committee. In the assembly. Of for those of you paying attention and perhaps that could be a- a good vehicle to. Make doubly sure that some of the conclusions you're looking at are followed through on. And you know we do I do fundamentally trust governor Newsome. I think he has not given us reason to doubt that trust at this point but we are certainly going to hold him to the promise he made to you all. And expect him to make good on that and hopefully we can do that by force of law. Assembly members. Any parting comments here. So with that your testimony is been hugely helpful will be leaning on you as we go forward in both developing so regi statute and I think you already heard from the agency from C. son you know we appreciate the expertise of your department in your work so thank you both for making the trip here today and for your testimony going forward. Thank you senator now we're gonna be moving on to the emergency response portion of today's hearing I'd like to invite to join us for their testimony Dr Cyrus Rankin director of toxicology and environmental assessment for the LA county department public health as well as deputy fire chief John Todd prevention services bureau at the LA county fire department. German. Thank you a German you may begin your testimony when you're ready and then we'll follow up with questions. Got it test test okay. Thank very much the opportunity to speaker Dr Cyrus Rankin with the Los Angeles county department of public health and what I wanted to do at this time is to give a little bit of background in sort of a re establishment for everybody about what it is that the public health departments here for and what our role has been throughout this. Throughout this time throughout the disaster and throughout the time after the disaster up till now the Los Angeles county department of public health is tasked with protecting the health of the public through prevention and mitigation of human health threats now the lease okay any natural gas disaster was. An unprecedented event as we all know it's regarded as the worst natural gas catastrophe at at any regulated facility. When you look at the- cause analysis and the testimonial that we just heard about the seismic issues which obviously need a lot more study you did the health department has always taken the stance in the past at least that this facility never should have reopened without that information being known and now that it is known in that way now that we have emerging information about that. Let me just single out our our director of health protection tucked it Mister blow has that stance changed at all for the public health department. No we still have that stance that's the stance we had they never should have reopened and- and given what we are now learning. It's becoming more and more clear that perhaps they should not be open at all. When you look we when you listen to. When you yeah and if you've ever heard Lucy Jones is the director geological sciences at cal tech I mean you know she she says all the time. We were expecting some big one you know something on this. On the same scale and magnitude as the Northridge quake. We have something like that going on we may not be looking at one well we may be looking at multiple wells and then we're not talking about. Voluntary relocation of this community we're talking about mandatory evacuation and that's a- whole other endeavor which really could be quite catastrophic. So that's the stance that we have at the at the department of public health. Now we were made aware of the event after our county. Fire department colleagues were informed by by field personnel back in two thousand fifteen. Shortly thereafter just within a matter of a couple of days. Public health began to receive health complaints from members of the community. That included headache. Nose bleeds gastrointestinal respiratory symptoms. Among others. And as these complaints mounted and expanded geographically throughout the throughout the neighborhoods in the committee of Porter ranch and others. It beyond Porter ranch. The gas company determined that the- time frame to stop the flow of gas for messes twenty five would extend. Far beyond their additional estimates and so at that time public health ordered the gas company to provide. Relocation assistance to any household who who desired it. Now public health. I will tell you now did not receive sufficient. Cooperation from the gas company throughout this response. Now while the cooperation was earnest at first. Soon thereafter there was a market lack of cooperation from the gas company bordering on belligerence and ultimately deception. And the public health of public health apart was unable to contain. I'm sorry to obtain. A critical pieces of information that we repeatedly requested from the gas company. Just a couple of examples we never received critical data regarding the composition of the source gas which we ask for consistently from the get go. Composition of the drilling was there were utilized. For the attempted well well kills and then consequently spewed out in the form of an oily mist and the landing on properties in causing more problems. And that being said we're now. Learning for the root cause analysis that they weren't even using the right kinds of drilling muds and that. It would became clear that even. Though they did several well kill attempts that maybe. They were getting evidence that well kilotons wouldn't be wouldn't work anyway so we're looking at looking at a process and I'm Noah engineer but we're looking at a price that they seem to have no efficacy. But certainly jeopardize the safety of the community by the oily mess that got spewed out with all the- attended kills that were unsuccessful. And so that led to oily residue on people's homes it may have lead led to the trans location of chemicals metals and others. Into homes that we did in a in a limited environmental investigation. And we've requested the database of homes that were cleaned or affected or tested by it so cal gas. Not a word on that. We asked for comprehensive chemical testing of the air starting in November two thousand fifteen as soon as the well. As soon as it became clear that this is going to last awhile that was not begun by so cal gas until January two thousand sixteen well past the peak of the event. So without these critical pieces of information public health. Did not have enough data to fully characterized the potential risks to human health. From the emissions and the extent of exposures that occurred. And finally public health was made aware through a permit renewal process that was required by the south coast EQ indeed. Of treatment systems utilized at the field. To remove crude oil routinely from stored natural gas before being served into the distribution system. Gas company never disclosed that critical piece of information a public health during the disaster. That crude oil was indeed contained in its natural gas mixture. So this wasn't just a natural gas exposure this is a crude oil exposure as well. We didn't know that they didn't tell us. So this critically impacted our assessments of human exposure during the disaster. Out Los Angeles county has taken some steps to try to address the situation for future responses to try to improve response should a similar issue occurred to occur again unfortunately no significant changes taking place up from the gas company to improve that dynamic for the future we would unfortunately expected experience the same issues again with the gas company if for example an earthquake were to cause a similar disaster. And public health unfortunately as department we don't have the regulatory regulatory authority at this time to demand information from a facility and to get it such as this at the time the disaster we don't have that authority or at any other time when the health department sorry when the health of the public is threatened. Regulatory authority generally rests with the state. But again the state regulators third not health officials right their environmental regulators and engineers not health officials when health is at stake for talks releases from Lisa canyon. Public health is the only such authority who has the sole mission to protect the health of the community. So Los Angeles county is work to expand that authority to demand immediate data to compel responsible parties to initiate environmental investigations. And to provide temporary relief to or to relocate affected individuals without delay and without antagonism. Now Los Angeles county is sponsored a beat fifteen hundred which was as assembly bill authored by a windy Correo that's being considered currently by the state legislature. And hopefully what that's going to do is a line the health department's long standing officer authority to control infectious diseases which we do all the time. A line that with an ability to control chemical exposures caused by responsible parties like the gas company that's where we lack of forty and that's what we need authority. Eighty fifteen hundred would be the first step to provide public health with the necessary authority to obtain cooperation and demand that from right responsible parties. In the future. In the meantime public health is working to examine the current health needs of the committee which are continuing. To this day with respect to the lease of disaster despite the stoppage of flow of gas from SS twenty five. Nearby residents continue to experience health problems to this day and as mentioned. This is an unprecedented disaster and that that means a requires unprecedented follow up and follow through to get to the bottom. Of why members of this committee are still experiencing these kinds of health issues and to determine the true impact of disaster. And the future operation of the field of for it. How that will impact nearby residents. In so we're working on this twenty five million dollar health study for the look the for the community here over the next several years to do just that. But of note however we still don't have. The necessary data that we've been requesting for years. From so cal gas. Since two thousand fifteen and that's critical to meet the health needs of the community. And without these data will continue to be in the dark and the community will continue to be in the dark about the true extent of exposures. That took place before. During and after the disaster. Thank you. Thank you doctor and I appreciate the thoughtfulness that you have in in now saying that the county department of health finds this facility to be unsafe to unsafe in fact to operate and needs to be shut down and while I understand the limitations of dealing with so cal gas throughout the course of this emergency I can also tell you that based on data that I found that was publicly available the department of public health took. Way way too few actions was woefully insufficient and their public out. We know that the league started on October twenty third twenty fifteen. On November seventh the A. Q. M. D. issues a notice a public nuisance to the facility. Noting benzene at seven times. Of reasonable and healthy level. We know that on December seventeenth as presented to the board of supervisors by interim director Cynthia Harding in a report. As early as December seventeenth there was reports of oily residue across the community on people's cars. On their homes on things in their yard. At no point between those two points to the department of public health issue a warning to the community to even be wearing respirators or to leave the community for their own safety. On February eighteenth twenty sixteen the well was officially capped. In March. March eight to be exact. After the well was capped the department of public health and you're listed as the primary contact on this information issued an advisory to local medical providers when evaluating patients presenting with mild headaches gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms or those with other non specific complaints look for alternate ideologies other than air contamination. Avoid performing any talks a logical tests these are not recommended art and are unlikely to produce useful data. For evaluation of patients. If no alternative ideology is found and there is a concern regarding either ongoing or past environmental exposures they were to consult you. I know of one physician who chose to utterly disregard this and not physician lost his job and we've heard from this community of other physicians who felt that their hands were tied in adequately assessing the symptoms concerns and complaints that this community was suffering from. And so I would like you first of all doctor to answer why when what we know is essential in either solving. A health risk to the community or either proving or disproving his theory. Or the difference between correlation and causation that critical instrument to do that is data. And not only did we block the community from having data the response leading up to this was insufficient for them to even go to doctors to try to start to collect complete blood blood counts or urinalysis or hair analysis in order to establish the data set to protect public health. So please address the glaring gaps and please do not I understand we all know the gas company was non responsive but you work for the people of Los Angeles county. And I want to know why your department failed. What do you bring up a good point these medical issues so let me let me talk about this. Now now my trainings in medical toxicology so this is where this is my specialty and what I can tell you about these these kinds of medical tests we were telling people. To test to understand whether or not someone was being exposed to gas is firmly so canyon that were causing certain medical conditions well we were telling positions is that getting these kinds of tests getting for example a blood benzene level or bloody urine level Benteen urine level or adhere level. These are not has from the medical perspective that are interpretable to give you the kinds of data that lead you to those diagnoses. That's the problem it's not because we want to leave them a way from the diagnoses we want to make sure that that he did that they did not get misleading tests that would lead them away from the diagnoses. In addition to that in addition to that one of the reasons that we issued this advisory to physicians wise that once the well was sealed and once air level started coming back down to background. We wanted to make sure that physicians warrant need jerking and diagnosing people with at least canyon related syndrome when they might have something else I got over a call from a clinician who was saying just that to me and as it turns out his patient was a seventy plus year old. Woman who. It's a shrug of the shoulders because there is no medical toxicologist who look at those tests and say I know what your taxes to the level is. That's what we told them not to get those tests but now we have an entire community full of patients who after nearly four months of exposure have nothing on the documented record to help them with their lawsuits. And to pursue their forget fort you know future healthcare needs based on the toxicology is that they live close to. UCLA excuse me we have the UCLA study there was limited granted everything that we did in terms of collecting data was significantly limited but at twenty locations noted between January thirteenth in January fifteenth volatile organic compounds were were noted in twenty locations based on the UCLA study. And that's months of exposure that these people were exposed to any right not you not only said don't look for look for alternative five. You know the path ology is that you said avoid performing talks a logical test you specifically got in the P. in between the doctor patient relationship. And ask physicians do not to seek the best. Nine to insure that physicians would not be let down in in correct path. I can guarantee you that if anyone has take it taken those kinds of tests. And takes them and you'd mentioned lawsuits all go ahead and talk about that and takes those to their lawyer I guarantee you that there are going to be experts in the courtroom on the other side who are going to completely blow those out of the water. And so it would actually work against members of the community to get those tests if you just want to talk about lawsuits. And leave medicine the side. Was there anything other than your relying on your professional expertise in this regard was there anything in terms of a state statute that prevented you from starting to collect a data set a baseline data set of residents who were having this exposure from the time that we learned that this blow out had occurred from the moment that people started calling us we were collecting data we were collecting data on symptoms we have a and a large sum to log of hundreds if not thousands of complaints. That occurred all throughout the disaster and continue to be reported to us today we have data on the environment as well with air testing and home testing that we've done so the health department's been there to collect an immense amount of data but that being said we're fairly limited in what we can do as a health department when it comes to this sort of thing we don't have a and ability and authority to go in and Marshall those kinds of tests we have to work from the outside in. And we're getting tests on the back and I knew someone had talked about this a little bit. I'm getting those kind of results from their own physicians because if he had gotten those kinds of results they would have been misled that's the problem because those kind they would they would have been misled about what their blood and urine levels what were of volatile organic yeah and this is why because you can walk into a you can walk into a gas station for five minutes and you can have a spike in your blood level of benzene and it's something that fluctuates quite significantly throughout the day so what can happen is you can go into your doctor's office you could be exposed to tons of benzene. And you could have a benzene levels down here and suddenly you're not using your benzene levels find therefore you were exposed to fencing that would have been misleading or you could have a level that was slightly above but maybe visited a gas station five minutes ago and then maybe doesn't really correlate with what your exposure was that's why we told people don't get those kinds of tests they're not going to lead you to the. Have data to do randomized controlled sampling because you prevented physicians from collecting no that would not have been randomized right you just told me that it would need to be randomized but that would not been randomized Texas it could be randomized by setting up control groups outside of this community this community was exposed in such a way that the only way to set up that kind of comparison would be to people outside of the community who weren't having the exposure and that's why we have twenty five million would help study pending right which hasn't which hasn't started yet because now we're five years or five years after the fact. When I'm telling you that if you'd gotten those tests during the disaster in people to it I got faxes from doctors all over the all over the city who were emailing me and faxing those kinds of test results and the vast majority is test results were. Normal normal. Okay. No the vast majority went on ten the ones that were sent to me they were all normal. And I said you know what don't get these tests because were diagnosed these people with actual symptoms related to the actual exposure. You take that to someone and try to show them that you were exposed to toxic way. They're gonna take one look at those results and say no you weren't. All right well there are there are a number of people who disagree and I think the unfortunate result of this is that we weren't. Collecting sufficient data to now really do a robust an adequate health survey. For these people and what we know anecdotally of the blood borne illnesses in this community of respiratory illness. I hope that we get some conclusion from that health study that will commence but my other question for you is. Who will be conducting not health study. So the del city is going to be that the money was. Allocated to us and public health. Right now we're in the planning stages for that for that helps any. So we have a steering committee and we're developing essentially an infrastructure. For that committee. We are going to be convening a scientific panel an independent. Scientific panel. Experts from all over the country. In addition to some experts from some of our some of our top health agencies. And they together are going to be. Making the determinations about what the study goals are. And then they're going to be putting out wh. What we call request for proposals. Out from those who are out there researchers who are out there who would like to. Utilize our funds to perform to perform research of the proposals will come from. Outside researchers we anticipate the academic researchers from universities. Who would propose studies and then we would allocate funding than to them. To perform the studies. And how much longer will that take. So right now we are at least a we're in the planning. The timings. And the allocations that will then go out to researchers. I appreciate that there's going to be an independent body I hope that the community will continue to be sufficiently engage throughout the process but my one real concern is that. The timeliness of the data. Is what sets the urgency and what sets the validity of whatever comes out of a future health study and I don't think we did enough. To collect really good data in order to keep this community protected and protect the future of their health but I appreciate your answers here today. Without so cal gas cooperation how. Thorough do you think the study could be if they continue to not release their chemical background information what will you be able to ascertain based on samples that been collected in the community. What we're gonna need to get that info I think we just we have to take no for an answer the info that the so cal gas has not given us needs to be given to us and needs to be given to that scientific panel it needs to be given to the researchers. So I don't think that there's any. Reason to consider what we would do otherwise. Thank you thank you very much for your testimony I'm and now with an issue for her for me. Excuse me thank you deputy chief John taught Los Angeles county fire department I oversee the prevention services bureau. Like that thank center stern assembly person Smith role in this hearing today a locally I think it's important that the people be able to come testify in their own community about the impacts on this and it's- I've seen some of them in Sacramento but I know the hardship of getting up sacramental. So I just want to start out by saying. Along with Dr Rangan what he said in the beginning was the county. Los Angeles county in the city. Central city did want to see this facility re open. And we fought against that facility re opening we were. The initial group to file charges for the lack of notification of the leak. We went in may testimony in Sacramento about the earthquake the seismic issues we want to see the RCA complete before the facility re opened. We tried to file we filed an injunction in court to county did trying to stop the facility from the open when they started injecting. So we have been very active in that but as the fire department in its first respond or so. We needed to be able to improve the safety of the facility going forward. And that with our partners here in the city of Los Angeles because as most of you know. The Lisa canyon gas storage field is. In Los Angeles county and something we were to respond to the county fire department but Porter ranch is in the city. So it's a city of Los Angeles so they have their- city fire department here so we- both. Both agencies jointly work was so cal gas to try to prove their safety. And I will say before October twenty third two thousand fifteen we don't have a lot of knowledge about the facility. I got contacted early two thousands about a facility expansion. And I think one of our primary concern always up here this brush fires. And that was really it another experience I had with the facility and- in two thousand eight in the fall when the Cessna on fire. Came off a broken line off the facility and came down and- close the one eighteen freeway an impact to the community Porter ranch. We went to the public utilities commission after that and change some rules so that those. Lines that broke during that fire would be something under their purview because prior to that they weren't. Of course during the incident we learned a lot and we would do things differently next time I think we were all a little slow to respond to the seriousness of the event. I know I was up here a few days after the leak was discovered. I always thought that calling it a leak was a misnomer from the beginning because as you. Got close to it. It it sounded like a jet engine it didn't sound like a leak okay. It was tremendous pressure coming out of the ground there. I think early on we didn't you know I know we didn't we were providing advice to so cal gas public health was with us. But we didn't go into a unified command early on. And go if we had another incident like this that would be something we would do early where we could bring. More resources to bear more safety to bear. And move the gas company long maybe a little quicker. During the event. Again we work with public health but I think there was. Since then we've had other incidents where we've had to improve our messaging to the community to our bosses. To share the seriousness of these incidents we've had other well issues in playa del Rey. In other areas that were smaller. But let's just say everybody's concern is heightened after certainly this disaster relief so canyon. We do have a better understanding now of a well kill fluids in them were captains that's really doctor Rankin's area but we do need this assembly bill to pass to have them provide the gas company and other utilities to provide. Greater disclosures to us so we can help protect the community and we can give the community better advice. One of one of the challenges we found is we were working with so cal gas both fire departments they had this thing called a risk management plan. In in bed and it was an emergency response plan. But when I got a hold of the risk management plan it was like a phone book. It was a seven hundred page document in a big binder heavily redacted. So it was very. Useless to a first responder who was coming to the facility to respond to a brush fire some other disaster. So we put together an effort with. Was so cal gas to build a smaller first responder book they can be handed to every engine company that comes in. This is a confidential document that provides all the well locations all water locations. All the other locations where we can. Going to the facility and help with some kind of disaster. Typically our biggest concern here is gonna be fires and- a lot of times with these utilities they don't want disclosed storage areas maps the signage wasn't great. We always you know in the fire to the ice figure going to show up someplace at two in the morning it's going to be dark you're gonna be trying to find something. So the gas company work with us to put a lot more signage to put together this this map. To make radios available to make it so it's easier for us to respond to. And mitigate initial early and that's for the safety of the people who work here there's a lot of people who work on the hill it's for the safety of the public. And as we know with fires the sooner we get to a fire and start putting it out. Less threat there's going to be. Our other concerns of the facility of course remain earthquakes and I think. Our doctor from Northridge did an excellent job of explaining. The better than I could for sure better than I did in Sacramento. Hits a modern pictures and some modern displays. To show the amount of displacement. And I appreciate him. And the clarity that he brought about how many wells could be affected. Even the wells have been repaired. By an earthquake. So earthquakes remain a big a big challenge. And that Santa Susanna fault is there and as we know any of these faults. There's other faults that. May not be highlighted right now but they're there. So those are always a concern. Of course well failures and those kind of incidents like we've had I think there's been a lot of. Safety mechanism put in place and I've heard again and again. How this is now the safest gas storage Philip facility in the country. But I'm not here to represent so cal gas. I'm here to represent you and protect you in practice safety of the public. So that's great. I'm glad they're making the facility safer. There's two other facilities in the county of playa del Rey was mentioned. There's also one in Castaic at the on a ranch okay we develop simmer first responder maps for those facilities. And sometimes out of these disasters. It provides an opportunity for improved communication improve relationships. And I would say that our relationship and are working. Ability with the gas company has improved. We had a leak down applied rate in February it was in the street. It was a **** that was leaking. The day I was the weekend we have another problem with another well in playa the people were aware of. They don't want to repair the gas leak till Monday it was Superbowl Sunday. Bay they did put a crew on it and repair that leak on Sunday I don't think that would happen without a relationship in the pressure and like come on we have problems down there let's not wait till tomorrow. Okay so I'm not saying it's all perfect our relations improved we help them they helped us during the war the fire which was another major disaster within our- jurisdiction. It is you know I hear what you're saying about closing the facility. But for the time being it looks like the facility is going to be here and our job is a county fire department is your city fire department. Is to protect you and make it safe as possible and we will continue to work with so cal gas our legislators. Public health to try and do that and that's my- my promise to you. And I thank you for your tenants in this long hearing today. Thank you very much deputy chief. She taught could you walk me through since we know that the blow out commenced on October twenty third but the emergency declaration was not made until January six could you walk me through how your department was involved in the ramp up to the declaration of the emergency and why it took so long. Yes well initially the leak happened on the twenty third and we were informed for three days which was the immediate violation of our of our codes that they didn't notify us immediately about the release. This was a new challenge for us. And you know we've done brush fires we've done a lot of disasters a lot of different things but we had not responded to a gas leak of this magnitude. And well. And they had fire people here and the immediate concern was to try and kill. The leak. And as you heard there was half dozen attempts. And everyone they thought was gonna effectively. Stop it but of course it did not and things got worse the whole got destabilized and is going through my notes for this talk it reminded me to looking through the news clippings and stuff. That the governor did not clear that disaster till January of two thousand sixteen. So it it it it pointed to it reminded me of the slowness of everybody's kind of response to this these people are feeling the direct results. But we were providing advice the state came down hello yes was here the governor's office of emergency services. They were negotiating with the fire chief. They were talking about well you want to going to command was so cal gas at the time we didn't feel like it was our incident we felt like it was so cal gas is incident. So there was some political discussions going on at the board and at the state level and the state wanted us to inject ourselves and so we kept inviting advisors and inviting more and more staff but it came to a point where we actually as we do on many of these big fires are many disasters. We going to unify command where we have an equal partnership in mitigating whatever it is and so and that's when I go back to I think something like this happen again unified command would happen immediately. But in this case it took some time and I think it was just a matter of understanding the scope of the disaster and- learning as we went. And I apologize for that I think we should have done more earlier but it was a challenging new situation for us. Accessing the most up to date information we know that during you know wildfires or other emergencies we ask people to rely on Nick's a lawyer official. On social media sites how would you plan on communicating with the community where this to happen again. Well weaver. My guess it had some other incidents smaller incidents with oil and gas wells. And we've developed a- a system where we have an office of emergency management the county. Our partners of public health in the board offices. Where where we've developed like levels kind of like you have like in homeland security level one two three. And then depending on the severity of whatever the issue is then we push out notifications. The example in the marina back in January. Was a single well. That was being re abandon. And on a Friday afternoon. It's a there was a gas release and some air pressure and a bunch of sand. It's sharp a geyser of seventy eight feet. But it was a one time event and it was done. And it took several weeks to actually kill about well in re abandon that well. But out of that. There was concerns about the level of communication even from the single little. Basically Burke from this well so we all got together as a team Mr blown OEM fire department our board offices. To put together. A notification. System so we can get the word out to the public sooner. Say that thank you and as a part of the espy thirty requires that the facility developed a safety plan. Going forward I I'm curious as the department or office of emergency services been invited to participate in the development of that emergency plan. So I think it was mentioned earlier today this story integrity and storage integrity management plan. We've had regular meetings with so cal gas and they've invited us they've that we review that document with us they've invited us to comment on it. It's some it's technical it's you're you're dealing with a lot of. Process is here and I think sometimes. If this facility because it's so hidden. A lot of people don't realize. The pressures in the in the amount of heat and of fluids and things that are going on when you see a refinery aside the freeway somewhere. You can say well refinery it's right there I can see all the- all the all the process is there going on the cracking of chemicals and so forth. But this facility the way it kind of goes up over the hill this kind of hidden. And it it it people are less aware of the of the hazards that are there. Is there any plan once the safety plan is developed or whatever measures the department has decided to take. To have a meeting with the community to reassure them about in the event that this were to happen again what that process would look like in terms of an evacuation or- you know using. Respirators or or equipment to protect their health. That's an excellent idea we don't have that plant currently but that would probably be an excellent followup to idea to have. Some of the county family in the city. Of folks from Los Angeles city talk to the community about what we do. In case of a future event. And you know per I've our our friend from cal state Northridge in his presentation on and- the seismic risk for this facility I would assume that something that your department is very. Concerned with as well because we're we to have it a sizeable. Earthquake again in this community your resources are going to be stretched fairly thin. Is the plan that's in place have any mitigation consideration to a seismic event what would occur for response. Yeah I you know I'd have to look more at that I I'd have to look more to seismic end of things. I know we're concerned about seismic I don't think we planned for. You know sixty wells failing and how that would. How we would mitigate that. You know I think there's more work to be done there. Right I appreciate your German for your testimony thank you very much you know I will say and I'm glad that we did get to the emergency response. And the health response because that was at the heart. Of what this community is still suffering with. The health effects are there the losses the real losses of human life or their diagnoses that may may or may not be related but we may never know because we don't have a sufficient data set that was started from the onset. Of the blow out it's important for us to look at all of those factors going forward in keeping this community safe and the other part of the community that I represent which is where the honor Rancho gas storage facility is I have two of these. In my legislative district and I'll be darned if we go through this again and have it on people in exactly this way so I appreciate that senator stern is on the same page with me and making sure that we have. On covered every possible area where. Your rank and file were. Exposed in going through still the same suffering that this community is as well so we'll be standing shoulder to shoulder with them and we believe there is sufficient discretion to go obtain a lot of the public health information that is already being requested I'm in the follow up to. Our letter to the CEO of the gas company you can be sure that'll be a component of it but as I mentioned earlier I think nothing works like the force of law and so will be looking to support from this administration frankly in working with the county. And some of our partners to help us get some legislation through so that. We have access to the kind of. What they'll call trade secret chemicals although we went through this with fracking and they said. If you disclose these chemicals will leave the state of California because everyone will know what we're injecting underground. And you know if they can operate transparently then they should leave. But the fact that this is still an old oil field. And that there is still benzene and other chemicals still down there and- wells like ward three you're still problematic. And that we frankly put the card way before the horse here and re opening that field before we knew the answers to all these questions. Is still an unacceptable decision that we have to just. We're living with right now and IT I wish we would've had got that bill off the floor that you help with deputy chief Todd we were one vote short. And shame on those colleagues who didn't support that legislation but will need to echo far beyond this room. Especially in subsequent statutory follow but will really be looking to the governor and his administration to help us make sure that there is a comprehensive emergency response plan in place. That this public health information there is no excuse anymore from I get from the gas company or any others. To disclose that kind of information we saw the same thing happened frankly after Wolsey fire. And a lot of the same the. Hoped public health data that still concerns me to this day so you can guarantee a response in Sacramento. In the weeks ahead we only have about. A month left of session will go back on August twelfth. But in these remaining for weeks. I think you can rest assured that this family member Smith myself. And what I'm hearing today is hopefully this administration as well will help us put a package together to have. Some kind of way to fill the gaps. To get dog the mission alignment they need to get them the data they need. To get those regulations in a place that aren't just good enough but and aren't even just the gold standard but to actually start to transition what that is but will need your your help in that regard. And we'll be looking to supervisor Barker and the LA County Board in that regard as well as all the city council and gas company may have some problems with that. And we know that they have a lot of political power but this isn't an exercise in politics this is an exercise in morality so thank you for coming here. So I'm I think at this point. Unless there are any final comments from the public I know we've been pretty thorough and we went a very long time I'd like to invite one last opportunity for public comment here I see a few other individuals so. Just to for the sake of protocol here let's let's so let's open this back up to public comment and then we'll we'll go with closing remarks but if I would ask if you've already spoken during public comment period to respond back in writing I promise you this committee these committees will we'll be compiling all this testimony and be looking at a report after the fact so if you have already testified. Please hold your testimony for written form but those who have not verbally testified yet please come forward at this time thank you all so much for your cooperation and thank you again to the administration of the county your independent experts for coming. And welcome yes Sir. Thank you. My name's you sound as Jim I'm the president of the poorest neighborhood council. Before I get home and we're gonna ask is folks if folks who just keep it down during his final public comment period we do appreciate. Your cooperation thank you. I do want to say before I put my comment is I forgot to thank LAUSD. For the effort they did to host us in this room here so guys in the back thank you very much yeah for all the work and for the- administration of thing cool. That allow this. Senator some remember thank you very much you have no idea how grateful we are. I want to save a few comments one is. We need you to understand this issue is a binary issue for us. We either miserably failed. And this facility stays open. Or we succeed in this facility close. There is no middle ground to this question I appreciate the counties need to have procedures in place because they cover a lot bigger a domain I respect that domain for this community. This is not a compromise discussion this is in either yes or no and nothing in between. You heard it from the community and this is the absolute position that the neighborhood council has taken and as you know we have been advocating for that closure as we go along. And there are two reasons for that position and for it being too at very adamant the two reasons have been mentioned today but I want to highlight. The first one is the fact that over four months of exposure. When the gas company knew exactly what was coming out of the field. They never told me they never told you they never told anybody in this room you heard it from the county which sort of mention it as a comment as we move on we need to stop at that comment. And recognize that there are certain things that are not acceptable and certain things that cannot be forgiven. From my perspective on the perspective neighborhood council that is where we draw the line. Because they can play Russian roulette with their children. Don't play it with ours and that's the bottom line. So. I have no idea what I expose my children too. And I will never know. And I have to move on from there and personally I have moved on from there that's why my goal is about a future issue not a past issue. So they have lost the moral right to be a neighbor. By their deception. And that is very clear to us. The second issue is the seismic failure. Now in this world that we live in there is no zero risk I respect that everything we do has a risk associated with it. But in my long straw inside another mile long straw. Has a significant risk of rupture in a seismic event there is nothing you can do to increase the size make strength of a straw like that. So. It comes down to what does the state C. as acceptable risk and what they don't see is acceptable risk that's what they're trying to define the problem for us is. This is not an acceptable risk. Whichever way you die sit and slice it this cannot be an acceptable risk for community and I'll tell you why. The chief was talking about emergency preparedness and thank you for that question. I will tell you the first thing that the city is putting in our heads in preparing for earthquakes is what. Have enough supplies to be on your own for at least. Four to five days because in a true seismic event there is not enough emergency. Responders to go to homes and deal with people. Now you can plan all you want when you are in a position where you say I do not have enough to come to people's homes in a significant seismic event. And put on top of that if a silly of this and exposure that addition is just not acceptable we're already dealing with a lack of sufficient preparedness for individual lives. And to say that we can be prepared for a failure of the sort it's just. Not realistic and it's not going to happen in that way there's a point where you have to look at the situation and say it may have been okay. Sixty years ago forty years ago thirty years ago. Things change there's a point to move on. We need the state to move on to a new paradigm and that paradigm has to be that there is no storage facility of this type in urban areas down not compatible with urban areas. And that is the end of my comment again so appreciate your being here and so if you're if you're listening to the community. Thank you doctor not him and thank you for making the trip up to Sacramento time and time again on your own dollar. Sitting with the governor's office sitting with this administration day after day grinding it out waiting and doing it with credibility and respect amidst outrage thank you Sir. Welcome. Hi my name's doctrine or della I was the doctor that was terminated okay for doing the studies and I just want to let this committee knows first of all thank you second of all a full report is in due diligence right now exposing all of the chemicals that we know of and all of their health risk including phase one phase two hair testing urinalysis for VOCs as well as the CBC's study. That were able to obtain. So I sat there very quietly. And listen to the testimony from the department of public health and I just have to tell you right now that that is absolutely not forthright. It will be all revealed in this report. The report will be made public. And the report will be made public all not only on it in a digital format but also. In regards to a town hall that will be presented on September fourteenth ask Alex may gray. time and we will go over the conditions of benzene exposure and that's just one little thing I want to touch on. As I listen to Dr Rangan a medical toxicologist and I was a graduate from UC San Diego and UCLA school of medicine and trained in three residencies. It is not forthright that his testimony talks about somebody pumping gasoline at a gas station. First of all we a sets the standards Ford has chronic exposure eight hour exposure and one hour acute exposure now I don't know when you know southern California I don't know anybody that stands there breezy enough gasoline fumes for an hour. At a pulp that then runs into their doctor and says test the benzene level and that's not even the issue anyways the issue is that these gentlemen. Our smart they're intelligent they're well educated. But yet they testified like they're not. And that is wrong then it usually means there's another venue been seen by the way just so everybody knows if you were exposed to benzene alone and not in a poly toxin situation the majority of time it causes no symptoms. So why would we be looking at that for clinical evaluation. Absolutely makes no sense he's just one small point though all be listed in your report that you can hopefully take to the governor. And hopefully stand on the podium of the health effects of the community. Thank you. Thank you Dr Dallas I would like to think doctrine or della for being the one physician who I know of in this community who is consistently puts patients first and the care and what data collection he was able to gather before being severed from his position and he he has done yeoman's work with the data he was able to gather through a lot of means that most of us in the links that many physicians would not have. Gone to get that set thank you doctor not alone. I spoke before just five seconds have you considered how the opposite era California Attorney General for getting the reports. We'll we'll we'll take that in consideration thank you. Are we gonna make another five second exception. So we are going to try to limit it to people who haven't spoken yet okay do you want to speak yeah do you mind having others who haven't spoken yet. Thank you ask a question after okay okay we can do that after thank you welcome. Walker fully senior organizer food water action I don't have too much to say that my colleague has already I just wanted to share something anecdotal with you last year I fundraised foreign built an independent effort to help this community make sure that Katie hill is represented by their ballots we got absolutely no help from Steve night when he was in Congress and I'm very thankful to see Katie hill staff out here representing us here and in Congress. My campus is in that effort all got sick. Knocking on doors in Porter ranch it was an extensive effort we wanted to calm the community five times and guarantee that we were able to at least turn out a thousand votes. For miss Hale. And I didn't even think. On the first day because I figured Ambien exposure or you know we'll be moving around. It's a big environment will be fine but reports started coming in over but the tax threat that. People were starting to taste metal in their mouth they were starting to get headaches. And I myself after awhile was unable to think straight anymore and that was just from two to three hours of walking around in the community last year. Around November. I note that it's not lost on some of the people on this panel that the health issues are ongoing this facility is a persistent threat to this community it is not just a threat to people who've been chronically exposed but to people who are even up here for a few hours at a time most of the folks who were canvassing with us were in their twenties to early thirties otherwise healthy individuals with no. Health complications to speak up and they all got ill within a matter of hours we had to cut our campus is short not just on one day but on several days through the course of the operation and I just wanted to report that it is. Still very much a threat to folks up here. Thank you Mr Foley. Welcome good afternoon hi my name's Vicki Selma. I when I personally thank senator stern and congresswoman Smith. For listening to us and especially I'm sorry the rank and left. I couldn't hear but those of us still have to say because and I'm thank you for. Hard questioning him. The county health department did fail us so many times. Many times. I was forced out of my home permanently. I drove a hundred fifty miles here. Be here today. Each way big as I'm still sick at I don't know what to permanent or not and I. My I have an environmental Dr. And he does not agree with Rankin. And. I tested right after that well it was killed and many of the things that have come up positive and I also did Dr north Dallas test and the between the two of them if you're smart and you look at it you can figure out they had to have come from here including machinery bits and the heavy metals and everything the county health departments protocol for cleaning. Was horrible. I came back I was sicker than before I left. And I was pretty tired sick and so was my dog immediately vomiting as soon as we got back in the home I called I emailed. Everybody I knew especially in the county health department. And nobody responded I couldn't stay there. I was I was just. Deathly ill so I left and it took two weeks for the county health department to respond to me can we come over and interview your home I said are you nuts. I'm so sick I had to get out again. I couldn't stay in my home it was worse. Than before the cleaning. They did and they the county came and the cleaners were not following the protocol and there were no consequences. Not no consequences of ever been happen. To anybody who has done something wrong the government. Through everything the promises nobody in this community has gotten us angled dime yet. After four years we haven't had anybody. My eyes my environmental doctor did test me. And he had a very good way of proving. That it came from a lease out. And I could go live at a gas station he said if I wanted and then you get retested and we were so convinced that the numbers would drop and so many of the things that were found how do I. Even if we don't have a complete list which we need. I had to have come from there there's no other way. It doesn't all come from a gas station. And it's just insulting it's insulting other Caryl department did not come through I was one of the ones that. Daily filed complaints. Even on my animals I talked to the county health departments vets. They said well it's the symptom occurred before the blow out we're not considering it was our job basically thrown in the circular file. That is so wrong now that we know the RCA we all knew what was going on before it. We just needed some proof and then they go and open it before the RCA. But now we know. And they threw all that evidence away from our reports. So what my dog is vomiting right. Massively during the blow out because we weren't notified and we were outside. She was sick before too and so are my other animals why fish were sick during that blow out. If they they didn't check the vet didn't care. Nobody the county health department carriage and I went up the ladder and I went and I went to the supervisors. I went to everybody pleading for help. Even during evacuation. It took them two months to get me out here. With their it was horrible so thank you. For questioning him thank you for listening please go to the governor. I helped as much as I could get you guys voted in and I am very proud of how you stood up to doctor rang in today. Consonants mess thank you. I am I do not regret my vote. And he's just we need to shut down for so many reasons I still have symptoms living away. And some of I a permanent hearing damage. I have my eye sight continued every time I got tested go down hill. Lower and I'm an artist if I lose my eyesight. I can't even imagine. It is critical it's not just about nose bleeds you are getting cancers I product whereas cough in different places not to steer it staying I was part of my lungs spot on my liver I don't know what's going to happen but I have for the rest of my life to worry about it. It's got to get shut down it must get shot down. Please please keep working with the governor. Thank you we will vacate. Hi my name's kill go he be now I live in Porter ranch for twelve years and I start to high being symptoms on about like nine years ago. On knows breed. All kinds of stuff that everybody's talking about. I was super healthy and I start and then ever since I know all. That deficit existence of this facility and passions of gas and oil five years ago I start asking questions and you know going to that public hearing meetings and- am I going to have a long term house effect. Am I going to have a cancer. And because I didn't get any answer on it and then brought happened. And a four four is the first things we heard it was is no house effect in my same don X. pro dead and I was using it you know I mean I'm I'm a brief meetings talking about my symptoms over and over and over again everywhere and same thing. And in. N. asking for on just to stop condemning anyone it environment and do something to help a lot hello this crisis. In. The last five months has being weedy challenging I'm most of most challenging time of my life. I found out I have the product of organ damage and don I was diagnosed with the conditions one state before breast cancer show on it and now I'm in the days kite is about having a breast cancer rest of my life. On so. I know that answer of long term effect I know that because I am I being experience in a yeah on so I'm Askin again. You guys are said to have. Your heart S. but if you really hard right now there is no other way people as you know for the sake of our life in our house we actually slowly dying here. So please jot down of a city is a B. thank you. Thank you. Hi I'm Jayson Hector and I just want to thank you guys for coming to our community we really respect you for coming to Porter ranch and this is a great opportunity for us to speak with you and continue to support you and candidates like yourselves who care about the community who listen to the community and- take action. And so we will look forward to continuing to support you guys work with you guys and elect more people like yourselves into government and so I want to thank you of just one issue that I didn't hear come up that I'd like you to. Maybe talk about or think about is this pipeline outage issue. Because I think that's one of the ways that they're trying to justify keeping it open but I know you guys are on it and once again thank you we always welcome you here in Porter ranch with open arms. So much appreciated thank you Mr actor. Okay. My name is Jason Adleman I've lived here eleven years when I moved in. I smelled gas I called the gas company and they came out and checked everything everything was okay. We in America I respect the police fire department everybody that saves us helps us and especially the politicians. We live on trust. And we trusted that a utility company would let us know right away. So we could evacuate not a leak I thought it was a leak. The utility company didn't even follow the law to report it to the fire department. After six months it was deemed we need to move. By the time that happened all the houses were gone. Where my gonna go it took two months to find a place I couldn't bring my dogs to the new place. And they complained I had to move back to my house. No one in this room knows what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night when you have no air conditioning the windows are all open. In your choking from the- gas. My house I'm so close to it I'm like a wind sock for it all I'm asking is the trust that everybody in this room has towards politicians in the respect is to just take this before your people. And have it shut down. You guys got to live with yourself twenty years from now if something happens. You're going to say I tried thank you for going up against a multi billion dollar corporation. That has a lot of this and people's pockets I'm just asking for the trust of a retired old man. That has asthma and trying to live out our lives in thank you so much for all of the people. Nurses fire department police we don't thank them enough they're the first ones that come in. Thank you so much. Thank you Sir. Hi my name is Karen Hughes I've lived here will be seven years soon I have no idea when I moved here that there was even up there because nobody disclosed that I think now I try to sell have to disclose it I happen to be a little dog and I happen to be at the park right down here. When it blew out. Timing I got out of my car and thought what is that terrible smell. I walked the dog I went back and told my neighbors there's something going on and they're like no you can never smelled gas it can't be a gas leak and one okay. So needless to say again I missed the I just basically got here so I'm not sure what was discussed but- I believe they held off on telling everybody for awhile. I have never smoked in my life. On the block never had any of those issues. I within. Well a couple weeks I started coughing a lot had nose bleeds I had headaches. The most annoying thing was every time I went outside my eyes wouldn't stop tearing. But you know I thought. Whatever because no one knew how bad this was so I kept living here and finally in January I was diagnosed with asthma never ever had as smoke. Before my physician insisted that I get relocated which I did in a couple weeks I believe after. The I called them. So relocated within about a week or so to yes No went away. And that you know I stayed there till they capped it and came back home and I guess I really didn't. React the way I should have I didn't like about the carpeting do all the things that a lot of people did because I still didn't think well it can't be that bad you know. And then in. April of last year twenty eighteen I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I there's no cancer anywhere in my family no where. After three surgeries radiation chemotherapy you know I'm still here but you know it just you know when I'm not obviously young. But I am going to continue living. As long as I can but you know I really worry about all this kids god only knows what they're going to be developing. You know as they go on through life especially if this place continues. To you know. Do what they do. So you know I ask and I guess I've heard a lot of people would come up here while I've been sitting here said you guys have been very wrists supportive. But I just wanna let you know that. I truly think no cancer anywhere in my family anywhere any side any peace person any type of cancer not even skin cancer. That there is a connection. So okay thank you thank you for your testimony ma'am. Thank you and I know you'll give it just a thirty second right I'm just gonna get one question. Basically because in honor of my of a loved one who just been diagnosed with lymphoma and been seen as one of the causes of up look almost so on behalf of him since even the Reagans no longer here we want to know if. The LA county public health or the state department of public health has blocked labs from giving information to doctor no delicacies aspirin labs you probably heard about this lawsuit and we think that that's a big possibility and he's he's going to set all this information but he wanted more doubt itself that's something that maybe on if you have any follow ups with doctor Reagan. Or the county or the state department help please ask okay. Thank you that's a really good suggestion thank you ma'am. Thank you. I was sitting here and listening to Mr Marshall and he said there's a world right now. That is having problems they're having complex issues with a to cap it for less. Two three ones. And that to me is another boat because last few months if you go on ghastly page people have been saying that you're sick you have symptoms. Sicker than before. And I can tell you he said he doesn't know about the religious I can tell you exactly what it is. It's east to the east of the facility because if you come in at night. You see so many lights there it's more than the football you know that there's this whole bright. And they're working on that they have been working on it for last two months this is another blow up so it's not like. What if something else. Is going to happen is happening. That's what you see here. One other thing the doctor. Talk about this. A test them for lawsuit and all that I wanted to know what's in my daughter's body so quick detox which so she could detox. Never given that information up to this point. Thank you Alan thank you very much do I make a closing comment similar. I would just like to thank the members of the community who are here for your patience you know it is not easy I know that your diligence and continuing to work together to support your neighborhood to your communities means a lot to the senator and myself. We hope that we've demonstrated our level of commitment to you by being here today and we will not let this drop we will not let it go we will continue to invite officials to appear before us to appear before this community until the issue is finally resolved in this community is ultimately safe so we thank you for your your ongoing patients that we realize that that is not easy. We think the officials who are here testifying today we hope that by all were inviting the neighbors to offer testimony but the beginning in the end you understand. The depth of concern that we have for this community that moving outside. Of this room and having these conversations in the very sterile Sacramento setting. Doesn't give you the full scope of what our what our collective responsibility is to the people of this community and so we appreciate you being here first hand. To witness that and we hope that as we continue to have these conversations as we restructure dagr as we look for the final CPUC decision. That you take that with you and remember that. It's more than pieces of paper that we're talking about it's these people and what this community means to us so thank you for your participation. Thank you simply member and I wanted to add in a thank you to.

And as well as to the administration for sitting all the way through and I. Secretary crowfoot literally just walked out at the at third before what I said but not after what you all said so for sitting and listening the P. you see our county folks everybody. You know there's a lot of talk about. What a transition away from fossil fuels looks like and how how pie in the sky and impossible some of these dreams are that we have of a- of a- of a green new deal of a future that. That doesn't make people sick and you know you don't need to look any further than just walking out these doors and looking up on that hill side to realize that there is a- a better way and if you can picture a future where that hill side is not full of gas and oil. And toxic chemicals that could make us sick. But a clean energy storage facility with solar and wind and batteries to fuel our community so that even the next earthquake. There still power on because the power doesn't shut down when the gas did we wouldn't be relying on this gas field and so for all the criticisms.
