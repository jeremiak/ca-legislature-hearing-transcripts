AB TWO THOUSAND ONE STANDARDIZES THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME EDUCATION NETWORK OR F. C. C. H. E. N.. CONTRACTORS AND PROVIDERS. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ADDRESS REIMBURSEMENT RATES SUPPORT CAREER DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS FOR PROVIDERS. AND USE THE APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT TOOLS TO EVALUATE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES WITHIN THESE NETWORKS. FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES PROVIDE A WARM AND NURTURING CHILD CARE SETTING AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING. THAT CAN BE FOUND NEAR THE CHILD'S HOME OR SCHOOL. THIS TYPE OF CARE SERVES ALL AGES OF CHILDREN IN A HOME SETTING AND IS FREQUENTLY AN OPTION FOR PARENTS SEEKING CHILD CARE FOR SIBLINGS. THIS MEETS THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES WORKING NONTRADITIONAL. HOURS SUCH AS WEEKENDS EVENINGS AND ROTATING SHIFTS. FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME EDUCATION NETWORKS OFFER A PROMISING PRACTICE MODEL FOR THE STATE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF FAMILY CHILDCARE OPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER EXISTING LAW LACKS. CONSISTENT ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE NETWORKS SO TOOLS USED TO MAKE QUALITY ASSESSMENTS MAYBE MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES SETTINGS. IN ADDITION EXISTING LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR UNIFORMITY IN PROVIDER RE EVER REIMBURSEMENT RATES OR ONGOING EDUCATION FOR PROVIDERS. SMALL FAMILY PROVIDERS AND THE VULNERABLE CHILDREN THEY SERVE SUFFER AS REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FALL BELOW WORKABLE LEVELS IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROPERLY PROVIDE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. BECAUSE LOSING A CARE GIVER THREATENS THE ABILITY OF PARENTS TO WORK. AND INTERRUPTS A CHILD'S COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. ARE DONNA SNEERING JR. DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. AND ADAM NORTH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHILD DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION. THINK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DONNA SNARE ENTER AND I'M WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER WE ARE A. NONPROFIT CHILDCARE SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES SAN BERNADINE ON LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WE'VE BEEN AN ADMINISTRATOR OF A FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME EDUCATION NETWORK SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. I AM AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME EDUCATION NETWORKS HAVE BEEN PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES. SOME THROUGH DIRECT CONTRACTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SOME THROUGH CONVERSIONS OF EXISTING GENERAL CHILDCARE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY SET UP TO ADMINISTER CENTERS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY NEEDS WERE CONVERTED TO WORK THROUGH FAMILY CHILDCARE. THESE PROGRAMS OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY TITLE FIVE STANDARDS AND A HOME BASED SETTING THAT GIVES FAMILIES MORE FLEXIBLE HOURS. AND SMALLER MIXED AGE GROUP OPTIONS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AS I SAID WE'VE HAD ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND TO OUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WE'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. FIRST IT OFFERS A SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SPACE TO A FAMILY ENOUGH FAMILY CHILDCARE SETTING THAT SUPPORTED WITH TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO MEET HIGHER QUALITY STANDARDS. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES A NETWORK OF SUPPORT TO PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE TO TELL FOLKS IS WE'VE HAD THIS PROGRAM SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WITH ABOUT FORTY PROVIDERS. AND OVER THIRTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN WITH US SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND IN A FIELD BUT STRUGGLES WITH RETENTION THAT SAYS SOMETHING FOR THIS MODEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE NETWORK OF EACH OTHER AND THE SUPPORT OF THE AGENCY. WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PRACTICES SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A MORE STANDARDIZED SYSTEM AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE CO SPONSORING THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING OUR. BILL TODAY WE'RE VERY HAPPY HERE TO BE IN SUPPORT AFFECTIONS WE KNOW WHAT A WONDERFUL AND IMPORTANT PROGRAM THIS IS TO THE FAMILY CHILDREN. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE SENTIMENTS ON THIS BILL. ARE ALSO AT THE PRESENT DEVELOP MANAGER LED TO SPEAK TO THE ASPECT THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE THESE PROVIDERS TO GET THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. I'D NEED IT TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF THESE PROGRAMS WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE FLEXIBILITY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO OUR FAMILIES. I KNOW FOR MYSELF YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE THROUGH MY CHILD OFF AT FIVE THIRTY THIS MORNING TO PICK HIM UP EIGHT THIRTY AT NIGHT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ALL NOT. YOUR TYPICAL CENTERS CAN DO BUT FACTIONS CAN PROVIDE AGAIN IN THAT WARM FAMILY HOME ENVIRONMENT. I THINK TO ENABLE THESE PROVIDERS EVEN FURTHER WITH THOSE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE QUALITY STANDARDS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS NECESSARY. TO BE OF SUPPORT EVEN FURTHER TO THOSE CHILDREN TO BE A WONDERFUL THING SO. OUR ORGANIZATION AGAIN IT'S CO SPONSOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING US TODAY.

MR HAS VERY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. AB NINETEEN OH NINE WOULD SIMPLY EXTEND THE SAME LANGUAGE TRANSLATION RULES THAT APPLY TO RECIPIENTS OF IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TED. I JUST US PROVIDERS UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TRANSLATES ALL WRITTEN MATERIALS INTO THE FOUR. MOST COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY A JUSTICE RECIPIENTS STATEWIDE. WHICH ARE ENGLISH SPANISH CHINESE AND ARMENIAN. COVER NO SUCH LAWS EXIST FOR HSS PROVIDERS AS A RESULT ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF AYE JUSTICE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH RECEIVE PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS TIME SHEETS TAX NOTICES FORMS. AND OTHER IMPORTANT MATERIALS IN A LANGUAGE THEY DO NOT PRIMARILY READ OR SPEAK. THESE FORMS ARE OFTEN COMPLICATED AND PRESENT AN EVEN GREATER BARRIER FOR PROVIDERS WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. TO MITIGATE THIS DISPARITY SOME COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN TRANSLATIONS OF KEY PROVIDER MATERIALS DESPITE HAVING NO FUNDING TO DO SO. THIS BILL IS A SIMPLE. WAY AND THAT AND NECESSARY WAY TO BRING LANGUAGE PARITY BETWEEN HSS RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS TO REDUCE DUPLICATED WORKLOAD AND PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ME I HAVE. KATHY SANDERLING FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND MILDRED RODRIGUEZ SHOVEL THE A. AND A TRUSTS US A PROVIDER FROM SUTTER COUNTY AND HER TRANSLATOR TO EXPLAIN THE BARRIERS SHE FACES. AS A SPANISH SPEAKING IHS HAS PROVIDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KATHY CENTER LIKE THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WERE REALLY PLEASE BE A CO SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION. AS YOU HEARD FOR MISTER NAZARIAN AB NINETEEN OH NINE EXTENDS THE SAME LANGUAGE TRANSLATION RULES THAT CURRENTLY APPLIED AYE TO ASSESS RECIPIENTS TO THE PROVIDERS WHO DON'T NOT READERS SPEAK ENGLISH AS WHILE. THE. CRILLON RAGS REQUIRE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TRANSLATE ALL WRITTEN MATERIALS INTO THE FOUR MOST COMMON THRESHOLD LANGUAGES IT'S BASED ON A PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD ON ACCORDING TO THE DSS RAGS. AND THAT INCLUDES. ENGLISH SPANISH CHINESE AND ARMENIAN THAT. AS YOU HEARD NO SUCH REQUIREMENT EXISTS FOR PROVIDERS EVEN THOUGH WE ESTIMATE FORTY PERCENT OF OUR PROVIDERS YOU NOT SPEAK UP OR READ ENGLISH. ON AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE THIS ISSUE IS JUST REALLY GROW MORE VISIBLE I THINK IS THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN AND AS IT'S BECOME MORE DIVERSE AND AS NEW REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. THAT REALLY DIRECTLY AFFECT PROVIDERS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. ON THIS IS A GREAT SYSTEM THAT IS ALLOWING OUR PROVIDERS TO REALLY GO IN MUCH MORE CLEANLY AND QUICKLY AND INPUT THEIR WORK INFORMATION AND THEN RECEIVE THEIR CHECKS BACK. HOWEVER THE. THEIR PIECES IN THE TIME SHEET INSTRUCTIONS THAT APPLY SOLELY TO PROVIDERS AND THOSE ARE NOT TRANSLATED INTO ANY OTHER LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THERE ARE PARTS OF THE RECIPIENT HAS TO COMPLETE THOSE ARE ACTUALLY TRANSLATED INTO THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES AND SO ON WHAT WERE SEEING IS ERRORS BEING MADE CONFUSION BEING BECAUSE THAT JUST DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OF THE TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TRANSLATED STATEWIDE ON AN ONGOING BASIS WITH THIS LEGISLATION. AS YOU HEARD WE HAVE ON MY TO SAYS PROVIDED HIS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO TELL HER STORY AND SOME OF THE STRUGGLES THAT. I THINK I SHOULD JUST YIELD THE REST OF THE TIME TO HER AND THANK YOU AND.

NICK. THAT JURY. I CANNOT SPEAK IN SPANISH BY THANK YOU FOR COMING AND THE TESTIFYING. A ASSEMBLY MY OF NAZARIAN THANK YOU FOR. AUTHORING DECIDE IMPORTANT BR IDEA TOTALLY OAK WE. ONE SO FAR WHAT I'VE. HERE. OF ONE OF HEARD UP BUT NOW I HAVE US MORAL QUESTION HERE. THIS ONE WAS SO ORIGIN ON THE ARE IN MY INTERPRETATION HE ANALYSIS ON NOTICES OF WHAT ACTION. ST IN TWO LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN BY SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF BOOKS IN HOME SUPPORTING US SERVICES SO. SO OUR I WAS A SPEAKING WITH MY STAFF FOR WHAT THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER. MEANS UP BUT NOW I HEAR YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC LANGUAGES SO A SPANISH TO CHINESE ARE AND THEN ARMENIAN. BUT NOW WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER LANGUAGES SO SUCH AS SOLVE MYSELF FOR MY MOTHER'S HAVE BEEN. TAKEN CARE OF LOWER YOU OUR AYE ITCHES SO THERE THERE'S A IT AT AS A PERSON AND DOES SHE HELD SO HAS SO CITIES SIMILAR. BECAUSE SHE'S A FACING SIMILAR NO QUESTION SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE IE HEARD DONE. THROUGH OUT MY STAFF INTERPRETATION OF SUBSTANTIAL WILL ASSIST YOU GRAPHICALLY THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL LANGUAGE OF MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE AREA. IDEOLOGICAL RUSSIAN SPEAKING A IN HOME SERVICES ARE PROVIDERS SO IN OTHER PLACES MAY NOT BE ABOVE COME AND MAYBE MORE KOREAN SPEAKING AND THERE. ARE THE SAME TRANSLATION SERVICE SO WOULD BE NECESSARY HOW. ARE YOU WHEN I SUGGEST THAT THOSE KIND OF PROBLEMS. A ENABLE CERTAIN EXTENT SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER. A OF LOVE PROVIDERS. I I WILL LET CATHY ANSWERED IN GREAT DETAIL BUT I HAD THE SAME. QUESTION AND INTEREST AND. WAS. RIGHT. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS IT WAS SO VERY REVEALING. OF. AT THE LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN BY THE PROVIDERS. AND. CREAN IS AMONGST THEM. BUT. I THINK THE NEXT TWO LANGUAGES WHO WHICH RANK HIGHER THAN CREATING. OUR COULD UNIT NOW MEAN DISEASE YES YES SO THEY ARE IN AN ORANGE COUNTY VIETNAMESE SO WOULD BE A VERY HIGH NUMBER PASSED OUT OR THOSE CITIES ARE LIKE I DON'T KNOW IN THIS SACRAMENTO WHAT THE SITUATION WOULD BE. IT MAY BECOME MINORITY SO HOW WE CAN RECONCILE THAT CANNELLA IN NO. SUBSTANTIAL MINORITY LANGUAGES ISSUES. AS A MEMBER IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION CATHY GONNA SEE WTA THE. LANGUAGE THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER LANGUAGE IS PULLED FROM THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ELSEWHERE IN CODE FOR THE. RECIPIENTS OF SERVICE SO WE JUST REPEATED THE SAME LANGUAGE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THROUGH REGULATIONS HAS DEFINED THAT TO MEAN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT. OF THE. OF THE RECIPIENTS. SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE SO WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULD APPLY THE SAME FIVE PERCENT THRESHOLD TO THE PROVIDERS. THAT IN THE STATE WIDE LANGUAGE THAT EXISTS TODAY FOR THEIR RECIPIENTS IS A STATE WIDE PERCENTAGE SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY YOU MIGHT BE EN. ON FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO COUNTY I KNOW HAS A LARGE RUSSIAN SPEAKING POPULATION AS AS YOU MENTIONED. OR IN THE BAY AREA YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE ASIAN LANGUAGES. OR IN LOS ANGELES AS AS AS WE TALK WITH YOU ABOUT I THINK. WE COULD CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I THINK YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO SEE IF THEY COULD SEE THEIR WAY TO CHANGING THAT DEFINITION SINCE WE'VE SORT OF RELIED ON THAT FOR THE RECIPIENTS WE APPLIED AT THE SAME WAY TO THE PROVIDERS AND I THINK I MEAN MY ASSUMPTION WOULD BE FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. YOU'D WANT TO APPLY THE SAME DEFINITION FOR BOTH THE RECIPIENT AND THE PROVIDERS FOR THE TRANSLATIONS SO THERE'S AN INTEREST SEVEN SEEKING THAT APARTMENT PERHAPS DROPPING THAT PERCENTAGE DOWN SOMEWHAT. SO THAT WE COULD AB PICK UP ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION JUST HELPING YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE WE GOT THAT FROM AND HOW THAT DRIVES TO. ENGLISH SPANISH ARMENIAN AND CHINESE BEING THE FOR WRITTEN LANGUAGES THAT WOULD BE ENCOMPASSED ACROSS THOSE. THAT FIVE PERCENT THRESHOLD THAT IS. APPLIED TO THE RECIPIENTS NOW. MAY I ED THEM MIGHT TO SEND SOUTH GUT FEELING IS THAT THE RATHER THAN USING THAT THOUGH ARTIFICIAL IF I PLACENTA. AS LONG AS. THERE WE A SOMEBODY THOUGHT WILLING TO SERVE FOR A AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND NOW WITH THE. LIMITED. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ABILITY AND I THINK OUR. YOU KNOW SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT. CAN HIRE TRANSLATOR IS NOT GONNA TAKE ARE. TOO MUCH MONEY. YEAH AND THE MUST SO TRANSLATED IF THE EVENING FILE ONE OF A VERY. RARE A LANGUAGE ONCE YOU HAVE IT. AND THEY CAN BE SHARED THE WITH THE OTHER. YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT DOCUMENTATION WOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME A THRUST OF. THE STATE STATE DOES SO YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN DOWN MOLD THOUGH AND THAT CAN BE EASILY SHARE OF THE AND THE VERY MINIMAL ACOSTA. SO THAT WAY WE CAN AVOID THE CATCH TWENTY TWO SITUATION. NOT IF OUR FRENCH YOU SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO PROVIDE AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE. LACKING IN WHICH ABILITY AND THEN I'LL WANNA HAVE WHAT BEING A GOOD OF FRENCH TRANSLATION. AND AND THAT ONE SURVEY HAVE IF THERE BE MORE FRENCH SPEAKING PEOPLE OR SIGN UP FOR THAT THE. INSTEAD WHAT I MEAN. SO ARE AYE I THINK OF THAT WOULD WITH THE ELECTRONIC AGE WANTS TO TRANSLATE IT. AND THAT DOCUMENT IS NOT GONNA CHANGE EVERY DAY UP PROBABLY LAST A. GOOD THE THREE TO FIVE YEARS SETTLEMENT WAS DOCUMENTATION MUST TO TRANSLATE IT I THOUGHT THE MINIMUM COST SO WE CAN COVER JUST ABOUT THE ANY. ANY LANGUAGE. I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND I'D LOVE TO WORK CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU. AND IN EXPANDING. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS PROGRAM SO THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT YEAH I THINK OF MY RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I THINK YOU FOR AFFORDING US THE TIME YOU DID MISTER OKUN EAT MUCH OF THE SETTING UP OF THE NEATEST THEY. JUST BECAUSE HE SEES BUT ALWAYS ON BLANCA. THAT'S. OKAY PUNKY CULTURAL PLEASE. RUBIO AYE. REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. I DON'T TO CHOI AYE AYE NOW. ARAMBULA HIND MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE RAYOS. STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. THURMOND DIE. IT'S GOTTEN SIX ZERO. THE MOTION WAS TO PASS THROUGH. ASSEMBLY PREPARATIONS AND I GOT OUT OF TWENTY SIX ZERO. MR TO GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO. THANK YOU AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE STAFF WILL WAS NICE SEEING YOU HERE. FULL WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. A. B. NINETEEN NINETY TWO IS A BILL TO HELP FAMILY RECEIVING CAL WORKS. COMPLY WITH THE AIM OF AYE THEY SHOULDN'T REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY FAMILY RECEIVING CAL WORKS OF BENEFIT ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE PROOF FALL FOR HUMAN LIFE THE SHINS FOR CHILDREN'S AGE FIVE AND UNDER. WOULD NOT PROVE THEIR BENEFITS ARE REDUCED BY HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS PER MONTH. THAT IS SUCH A GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY FOR THOSE FAMILIES WATER SON MY THINK THAT THOSE PARENTS HAVE MADE THE CHOICE TO HELP YOUR KIDS GO WITHOUT. VETS NATION DID RESEARCH ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY BILL FAMILY THAT DIDN'T LACK OF THEIR* TO HEALTH SERVICES. FULL FAMILY LIVING IN ENDED A DEEP PROPERTY. SO INSTEAD OF PENALIZING THOSE FAMILIES AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO WILL HELP PROVIDE RESOURCES INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION FOR THOSE FAMILIES TO OBTAIN NECESSARY BUTTON NATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THAT HERE WITH ME TODAY IS JUST A CALL BOX LOW. FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND GENEROUSLY NUMBER CANNELLA LOAN. FROM THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND BOTH ORGANIZATION ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON TO ASK NOW IN WITH CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA WORK CO SPONSORING AB NINETEEN AT NINETY TWO. CURRENTLY OF THE FAMILY RECEIVING CAO WORKS IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE PROOF OF IMMUNIZATION WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. THEIR CAO WORKS GRANT IS REDUCED. AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO SUPPORTS CHILDREN IN FAMILIES BY EXTENDING THE TIME A FAMILY HAS TO VERIFY IMMUNIZATION FROM FORTY FIVE DAYS TO SIX MONTHS. FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES CAN ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO TIMELY IMMUNIZATION FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. RESEARCH SHOWS PARENTS MAY LACK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IMMUNIZATION OR UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLICATED COMPLICATED IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN OR WHERE TO GO TO GET THEM. THEY MAY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IMMUNIZATIONS SAFETY OR THEY MAY BE UNAWARE OF THE THREAT F VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES. AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN THE SIX MONTH EXTENSION WILL GIVE FAMILIES NEEDED TIME TO OBTAIN IMMUNIZATIONS. BEFORE SCHOOL FOR THEIR BEFORE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND BEFORE THE GRANTS ARE REDUCED AS A PENALTY. A. B. NINETY TO NINETEEN NINETY TWO WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT COUNTY SUPPORT FAMILIES BY PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE AND CLINICS PROVIDING NO COST IMMUNIZATION. RESEARCH SHOWS PENALTIES DO NOT INCREASE IMMUNIZATION RATES THEY SIMPLY DRIVE FAMILIES FURTHER INTO POVERTY. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT SUPPORTING FAMILIES WITH INFORMATION DOES DOES ACTUALLY INCREASE IMMUNIZATION RATES. AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO WILL SUPPORT FAMILIES AND INCREASED IMMUNIZATION AND CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN SCHOOL AGE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY. I COMMAND CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DOES HAVE ARE FULL OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ALSO CO SPONSORED THE BILL IN ADDITIONTO THE THINGS OTHER THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED TO DO. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO REGULARLY INFORM AT THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE VACCINATION COMPLIANCE. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. AS MY COLLEAGUE TO THE LEFT OF ME CAN ATTEST FOR YEARS WE REQUESTED THIS INFORMATION IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET IT. AND WHEN WE GOT IT IT WAS A PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING TO LEARN ABOUT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE DEEPLY IMPOVERISHED GOING WITHOUT VACCINATION AND A DEPARTMENT HAS. NO IDEA WHY WE DON'T KNOW TO THIS DAY WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T THEY ABILITY TO VERIFY THEY'VE LOST A VERIFICATION DID HOMELESSNESS OR DOMESTIC THING DOMESTIC ABUSE. WE DON'T KNOW TO THIS DAY IF THEY COULD USE A LITTLE HELP AND THAT WOULD HELP THEM TO TO OF VERIFY. ALREADY IN THE LAW THERE'S AN OPT OUT PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MEDICAL OR PERSONAL BELIEF SO IT ISN'T BECAUSE OF THAT. IT'S BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY AREN'T THERE ART VACCINATED AND AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON. SO THIS IS REALLY TROUBLING TO ME THAT WE. HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR TWENTY YEARS OF THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT THIS POLICY WAS NEVER INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS. WERE VACCINATED. THIS WAS THAT THIS THIS PROVISION OF THE LAW WAS PASSED UNDER PETE WILSON AND IMPLEMENTED BY ELOISE ANDERSON AND. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THEY HAD REALLY INTENDED FOR PEOPLE TO. VERIFY THAT THE CHILDREN WILL BECOME A VACCINATED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS KIND OF INTEREST INTERVENTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILIES WHEN THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO VERIFY THAT THE NATION. THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTED TO FIND THEIR WAY TO A VACCINATION CLINIC. SO I'M I'M THRILLED BEYOND WORDS THAT A BITASSEMBLYMEMBER HAS AGREED TOOK UP. AND OFFER THIS PROVISION REALLY URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT IT OF I THINK THAT WILL REDUCE CHILDHOOD POVERTY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. LEAD TO HEALTH CARE KITS. COULD HAPPEN KEVIN AS THE CHORUS CALIFORNIA OFFER RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CLOSE SPONSORING THE BILL. IN URGING THE IBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO I HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SELENA PIRACY ALIEN SUPPORT. MONICA SAMI ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AT A PREMIUM OR FROM THE CHILD CARE LAW CENTER IN SUPPORT.

TO CLARIFY THE POPULATION OF CHILDREN TO WHOM THE IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENT APPLIES AND CLARIFY. AND RE ORGANIZE TIMELINES AND PROCESSES THAT'S IN. THE BILL. GET ANY OTHER COMMENT ANY COMMENTS FROM THE YOU ARE COMMITTEE. CONDUCT CHOI. I HAVE A QUESTION NOT TO SOMEONE. CHU. I THINK THIS IS SO WELL INTENDED. A BILL A. EXTENDING. THE A ARE IMMUNIZATION TERRY THE FINAL FORTY FIVE DAYS TO SIX MONTHS. AGAIN I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY CONSULTANTS ARE AND A STAFF MEMBER SO. WHERE THIS HAS SIX MONTH SO? I HAVE COME FROM. THAT IS SO TO ME I'M GUESSING IS SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE REASONABLE TIME FOR FAMILIES TO. TO FIND TIME. AND THAT'S GET AROUND TO IT THAT PICKED THE CHILDREN TO. FANS AT THE ME THAT FOR IMMUNIZATION. HOWEVER OUT DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE THE SIX MONTHS THAT CAN BE A LONG TIME FOR YOU OUR LITTLE CHILDREN UNDER AGE ALL FIVE. SINCE OUR ARMED I A RECENTLY HAD THOUGH ALCUIN CHILD. I THOUGHT ABOUT TO HAPPEN. IF FOR MY DAUGHTER. A DELAYING. NECESSARY YEAR IMMUNIZE DEJAN. WELL IT IS TO DO AFTER TWO MONTHS OF THE BOOK. BUT DOT AND AUGUST SIXTH TWO MONTHS SO SHE HAS TO WAIT THE BECAUSE ISSUES UP. UNABLE TO GET TO FOR WHATEVER REASON. ISN'T THAT THAT EXPORTS SINGLE CHILD INTO DANGER. HOW COULD CURRENT MEDICALLY? IT MAY BE DOING THAT THAT CRITICAL TIME. I THINK WE HAVE OUR DOCTOR PEDIATRICIAN CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOPE WHAT THE DATA SO. NEGLIGIBLE PURE YET. WALK CRITICAL TIME FOR CHILDREN TO GET E. R. IMMUNIZATION IN TIME. MAYBE EITHER YOU CAN S. SO WHY YOU CAN ASK A ASSEMBLYMAN. ADAM WHAT CAN THEN WELL LET ME GIVE DE AFFAIRS SHOP AND THEN DOCTOR RAMBLER THAT DEFINITELY CAN CHINA. FOR. YEAH PRESIDENT ALL AND I. BUT THE AND IT AGAIN IT AND SIX MONTHS. YOU MAY THINGS A LITTLE BIT LONG BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE IT PROVIDERS AND HE LOOKED AT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AS WELL. AS TO FAMILY AND AMPLE TIME TO TO WORK TOGETHER. THE SHOTS THAT THEY NEED IS NOT SAYING THAT I THOUGHT ONE WAY FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE ADULTS BUT NOT OF ME ABOUT A HOUSE THE EXPOSURE OF THE CHANGED EXACTLY AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. BUT I WILL SAY IS. WITH ALL DUE TO CERTAIN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO DOES CHILDREN'S WE GO. EVEN LONGER WITHOUT. AND IMAGINATION. SO DISTANT DISPEL HAVE NO IMPACT TO DATE DILUTED TO THE HEALTH. OWN OR DID RISK OF TO CHILDREN IT WILL ONLY IMPROVE LAURIE IT REDUCED THE RISK OF THE CHILDREN. BECAUSE NOW WE'RE PROVIDING A HOME AND THEN DONE THE TO TRANSPORTATION AND ALL THOSE NECESSARY STEP. TO TO HELP THEM TO GET THE SHOTS THINGY. I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT OR ANY PROVIDING UNNECESSARY RESOURCE SUNRISE I TRUST PROTEST RABA ENDING AS A ONE GAME LEAD THEM BUT TODAY EXTENSION IS SO WHAT ARE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THAT THAT'S THE CRITICAL TIME IS. REALLY GOOD FOR CHILDREN ARE NOT. RIGHT THE A AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REPEAT THAT. WOULD ALL THIS BILL DOES CHILDREN COULDN'T COOK MAKO EVEN LONGER. WITH. AND MEDICINE NATION. SO DOES BILL WOULD. WE WILL GO AND EDUCATE THEM ANGER ANYWAYS DR. CHURCH SO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I WORKED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND NOT AS A PEDIATRIC. IN AND SECOND I WOULD CONCUR THAT THE SOONER WE CAN GET THE VACCINATIONS THE BETTER BUT THOSE ARE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES BETWEEN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. IT SEEMS THAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO GET PATIENTS TO PROVIDERS IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION. AND TO PROVIDE RESOURCES WITH THAT AND I SEE A REAL BENEFIT TO THAT. BUT ANY OTHER ONE THING THAT I COULD JUST ADD. YOU KNOW THAT THE. THE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE LET THE DOCTORS TELL US ALL TO IMMUNIZE A CHILDREN WITH THEN ISN'T CHANGING AT ALL RIGHT THAT WILL STILL BE THE SAME. AND WHAT WAS MOLD CHANGES IF THE FAMILY DOESN'T PROVIDE VERIFICATION. THEY'RE NOT CUT OFF BENEFITS THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WILL CHANGE THEY'RE NOT SANCTION THE BENEFITS AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THAT SANCTION OF BENEFITS. ISN'T RETURNING THE CHILDREN BACK TO GET VACCINATION INSTEAD IT'S CUTTING THE PARENT AND THE SUPPORT SERVICES TO GET THE VACCINATION. OFF FROM THAT FAMILY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ELONGATING THE PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF KIDS UNVACCINATED AND WE HAVE NO CONNECTION TO THEIR PARENTS TO HELP GET THEM BACK IN. TO VACCINATE. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY THE BILL I'M WORKS TO ACTUALLY SHORTENED FOR THIS VERY REASON HAS WORKED WE'RE VERY CONCERNED JUST LIKE YOU. AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR PICK BONTA. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING WITHOUT VACCINATIONS AND WHAT'S WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE CURRENT INTERVENTION TO CUT THEM OFF FROM BENEFITS. IS ACTUALLY HAVING THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF BRINGING THEM BACK IN SO INSTEAD OF DOING THAT. OFFERING THEM HELP UP TO GET THE VACCINATED AND AND WITH URGENCY. WHAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FORTY FIVE THIS CAME FROM? WAS OUT OF THE BLUE SKY. SO THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND THING IS THAT THE SIX MONTH OF THE MEAT THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A POLL FIX MONTH. YOU COULD TAKE FIFTY DAYS SIXTEENTH PENDING FOR WHATEVER TEN DAYS. IMAGE JUST GIVE PEOPLE MAXWELL FLEXIBILITY GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT TAKES MONTHS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT THESE DAYS WITH THE DOCTOR. WITHOUT ACTED IN THE SEVENTIES OF THE SIXTIES YOU WENT THERE THEY SAW YOU DON'T HAPPEN NO MORE. THIS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MCCALLUM. I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIGHTS BOAT. THANK AND I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO DOUG DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RUBIO AYE REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANNA START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS AYE AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE SYSTEM RESULTS IN TOO MANY CHILDREN BEING MOVED FROM HOME TO HOME TOO FREQUENTLY. WHEN CHILDREN UNDERGO MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS THEY ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SEVERE TRAUMA. THIS TRIAL MANIFESTS ITSELF MANIFESTS ITSELF BEHAVE MORALLY EMOTIONALLY SOCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY MAKING IT LESS LIKELY FOR THESE FOSTER YOUTH DEFINED PERMANENCE AND ADOPTION A REUNIFICATION. STUDIES SHOW A MAJOR REASON FOR FAMILIES TO REQUEST REMOVAL FOSTER CHILDREN FROM THEIR HOMES IS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT FROM THE CHILD'S CASE WORKER. ADDITIONALLY THE PRE PLACEMENT TRAINING THAT BOSTROM KINSHIP FAMILIES RECEIVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND POST PLACEMENT CARE. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOR WILL ESTABLISH A TWO YEAR PILOT PROPRIOCEPTIVE BITING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO FOSTER AND KINSHIP CAREGIVERS. VIA POST PLACEMENT COACHING THIS COACHING PILOT WILL HELP FACILITATE THE CARE GIVERS TRANSFER OF LEARNING FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH CHILDREN PLACE IN THE HOME. WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PREPAREDNESS OF AND SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES BY PROVIDING THIS COACHING THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL IMPROVE PLACEMENT STABILITY THEREBY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TRAUMA SUFFERED BY FOSTER YOUTH. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IS MICHELLE EVANS A MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW STUDENT AND MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC. AND JENNIFER REX ROAD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CAREGIVERS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RUBIO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT MY NAME IS MICHELLE EVANS AND I AM A STUDENT AT THE MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW PARTICIPATING IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC. I AM ALSO A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE BEEN A SOCIAL WORKER FOR NEARLY NEARLY TWENTY YEARS. I SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE FOR MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT. TO OUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE AND THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OUR KINSHIP AND FOSTER FAMILIES. WHEN CHILDREN ARE REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME AND FAMILY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN MENTIONED THEY EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AND THE EXPERIENCE FURTHER TRAUMA WITH THEIR MOVE FROM HOME TO HOME TO GROUP HOME. TO ANOTHER HOME TO RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT AND THIS MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BONDS AND ATTACKED WITH FUTURE FAMILIES. AND MEETING WITH CHILDREN MYSELF I'VE HAD THEM TELL ME THINGS SUCH AS. FEELING ALONE AND CARED FOR THEY FEEL LIKE THROWAWAYS I'VE EVEN HAD THEM TELL ME THEY JUST FEEL LIKE TRASH AND THEY NEVER WANT TO. BINDER ATTACHED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY AGAIN THEY JUST LOSE THEIR HOPE. WE CAN DO BETTER THAT MESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH A DESIGNATED PERSON. TO ASSIST THE FAMILIES AND HELPING CHILDREN MAKE THE TRANSITION INTO THEIR HOME. HELP THEM BONDED ATTACHED WITH THE CHILD HELP THEM WORK WITH THE BIOLOGICAL FAMILY TOWARDS REUNIFICATION AND EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE AND CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS. THIS IS ALSO A CRITICAL TIME AND DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CCR. WHERE CHILDREN ARE BEING BROUGHT OUT OF GROUP HOMES WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD THING INTO FAMILY SETTINGS THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAMILIES? WHO ARE PREPARED AND QUALIFIED TO CARE FOR THOSE CHILDREN COMING OUT OF GROUP HOMES AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THESE CHILDREN BEING FORCED INTO HOMES? THAT AREN'T ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO CARE FOR THEM AND MEET THEIR NEEDS OR IF THEY'RE STAYING LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO IN THE GROUP HOME LANGUISHING. AND SO THIS IS A AT THE VERY TIMELY AND TO PROVIDE A DESIGNATED PERSON A COACH TO SUPPORT THE PARENTING. AND OF THESE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILS A CRITICAL NEED FURTHERING THE AIMS AND EFFORTS AT THE CC OUR FOR EVERY CHILD TO LIVE AN UNSTABLE COMMITTED AND NURTURING FAMILY. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. I'LL GIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS. I'M JENNIFER REX RAILROAD AND I'M A FOSTER PARENT AND YELLOW COUNTY. AND I BELIEVE THAT RESOURCE FAMILIES ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. ASSETS OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT OUT SAID. AND ANY INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE MAKES AN RESOURCE FAMILY IS GREATLY IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AND SUSTAINS THAT STATE ASSET. COACHING BOOK EVERY SOURCE FAMILY IT'S A PRACTICAL SUPPORT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THE TOOLS AND THEIR PARENTING TOOLBOX WHILE PUTTING THEIR STRENGTHENED LEARNING. INTO PRACTICE WITH A SPECIFIC CHILD OR CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. IT WILL HELP PARENTS LEARN HOW TO BOND WITH THE CHILDREN. I'M IN THEIR CARE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA AS WELL AS SUPPORT THEM WITH PRACTICAL APPLICATION. OF PARENTING SKILLS THEY HAVE LEARNED IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED WAY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD OR CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. I. BRANDY RESOURCE FAMILIES TAKING ON. THAT FIRST TIME PLACEMENT AYE RELATIVES WHO'VE HAD NO WARNING. OF A CHILD COMING INTO THEIR CARE AND RESOURCE FAMILIES WHO ARE. TAKING CHILDREN FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE ARE RESOURCE FAMILIES WHO WE IN THE FIRST NINETY DAYS. COACHES AND CAN HELP THESE FAMILY AND EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE AND CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS SO THAT THE NEEDS OF. OF THE CHILDREN AND THE STABILITY OF THE PLACEMENT IS ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY WAY INAPPROPRIATELY. COACHES CAN ALSO HELP RESOURCE FAMILIES WORK WITH BIOLOGICAL FAMILY IT'S AT SUPPORT RE UNIFICATION. AND POTENTIALLY ESTABLISHED LONG TERM SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES TO REUNIFY. RESOURCE FAMILIES NEED TO BE SUPPORTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE HIGH QUALITY OF PARENTING THAT WE AND EXPECT FOR CHILDREN AND FOSTER CARE. HELPING FAMILIES AND WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHILE ALSO. AND PREVENT SEVEN DAY NOTICES WHICH IS WHEN A FAMILY AND IT'S. SO OVERWHELMED. ON THAT THEY GIVE NOTICE TO THAT APARTMENT THAT THINK THE CHILD NEEDS TO MOVE. ON AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CAUSES MORE. TRAUMA FOR THE CHILD SO BY ADDRESSING CHALLENGING SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY CAN'T BECOME A CRISIS. AND IT NOT ONLY HELPS TO. AND. TO PREVENT THREE TRUMPETED NATION OF CHILDREN BUT ALSO TO RETAIN ON FOSTER FAMILIES HILL HAVE MADE THE COMMITMENT TO CARE FOR CHILDREN THINK YOU SO MUCH. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THERE MIGHT HAVE A BILL SECURE. THANK YOU THE BILL IS OUT ARE TO APPROPRIATIONS SIX ZERO AND MR MAIENSCHEIN YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL. PAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN FACING HOMELESSNESS IN SAN IN SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO TWO. IN AND IN AMERICA IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH CURRENT LAW PROVIDES TEMPORARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO HOMELESS FAMILIES RECEIVING AID THROUGH THE CALLASPO RAMP UP TO SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS IN A HOTEL MOTEL. OR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE THE TEMPORARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE CAPS AT SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS A BREAKING ASSISTANCE INADVERTENTLY PUNISHES FAMILIES TO VACATE THEIR TEMPORARY LODGINGS FOR JUST ONE DAY. THE RULE ITSELF ESTABLISHES A DISINCENTIVE TO FIND ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. SEEK PROSPECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT OR TO LAND TO PRESSING HEALTH OR FAMILY OBLIGATIONS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD FURTHERMORE DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OFTEN CANNOT FIND A PERMANENT PLACE TO LIVE. DUE TO A LACK OF OPTIONS CURRENT LAW ONLY ALLOWS PERMANENT HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO BE USED IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING SHELTER WITH THE PERSON WHO'S IN THE BUSINESS OF RENTING PROPERTY. AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE WILL REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE SIXTEEN DAYS BE CONSECUTIVE. AND WILL ELIMINATE THE DISINCENTIVE TO REFUSE OR INTERRUPT TEMPORARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE ADDITIONALLY AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE WILL ALLOW PERMANENT HOUSING ASSISTANT TO BE USED TOWARDS SHARE HOUSING SET SETTINGS.
