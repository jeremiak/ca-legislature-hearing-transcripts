WELCOME WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY- SHAPE THE OPPORTUNITY PRO THOMAS ARE ATKINS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I ENJOY THE CONVERSATIONS I WAS ABLE TO HAVE. YESTERDAY SO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT ABOUT SEVENTY TWO MY WIFE LISA. AND MY SON'S DONE JUNIOR JAMES WITH ME TODAY AND I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THEIR- LOVE AND SUPPORT THROUGHOUT MY PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER. I'M HONORED TO SERVICE REAL ESTATE COMMISSIONER DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE STILL CRUCIAL TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AND LIVABILITY ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING I'M GRATEFUL AND HUMBLE THE GOVERNOR TO SOME SELECTED ME TO SERVE IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE. DURING THIS IMPORTANT TIME. BY EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION MAKES ME UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS COMMISSIONER. ONCE I WAS APPOINTED IN APRIL I WORK DILIGENTLY WITH OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM TO RAPIDLY DEPLOY HE EQUIPMENT TRAINING AND RESOURCES OUR TEAM NEEDED TO WORK SAFELY AND A REMOTE SETTING. AND I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE 90% OF OUR TEAM AND DO YOUR READ. ON THE TELEWORK SCHEDULE. OUR MOST PUBLIC FACING COMPONENT THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED BY CO IT IS OUR LICENSING EXAM AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. AND DESPITE THE STATE HOME ORDERS THAT REQUIRED US TO SHUT DOWN FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS. AS WELL AS THE NEED TO WORK AT 50% CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. WE'VE ACTUALLY MINISTER MORE EXAMS DURING THIS PERIOD THAN WE DID LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT. WE'VE DONE SERVICE SO THREE VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULING AS WELL AS ADDING CAPACITY VIA EVENING. AND SATURDAY EXAMINATIONS AND ALL THIS WORK TRANSLATES TO THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS EARNING THEIR LICENSE ENTERING THE ORK FORCE AND WORKING IN AN EXCITING FIELD. OF REAL ESTATE. WE'VE ALSO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO GO AFTER UNLICENSED PRACTICE ILLEGAL OPERATORS ARE ABSOLUTELY OUT THERE IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND WHEN YOU THINK OF A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. AVERAGE CONSUMER FOR MOST CONSUMERS IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST IGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENT YOU MAKE IN YOUR LIFE. AND THAT ABSOLUTELY ATTRACTS ABOUT ACTORS SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT GEE ARE YOU BE VIGILANT AND AGGRESSIVE AND STEP INTO THE MARKET PLACE TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS. ARE PROTECTED. AS COMMISSIONER MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS TO BE TRANSPARENT COLLABORATIVE AND INNOVATIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO FIND NEW AND BETTER WAYS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AS WE STRIVE TOWARD GOVERNOR NEWSON GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S VISION. OF A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER. I APPRECIATE THAT. LET ME GO AHEAD AND GO FIRST TO SENATOR BATES WHO'S PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. SENATOR BATES. BUT I THINK YOU- YEAH OUR CONGRATULATIONS COMMISSIONER MACAULEY FOR ON YOUR NOMINATION I WOULD LIKE TO START OUT BY APPRECIATING THE LITTER THEY CHEW SANCHIN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT CAME FORWARD I THINK WAS MANAGE TWENTY TWENTY LAST YEAR BUT I THOUGHT YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT WAS VERY THOROUGH- I AM CERTAINLY I ANSWERED EVERY ONE OF THE OB. I GUESS HE CALLED THE ALLEGATIONS REGARDING YOUR QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE IN THIS POSITION SO I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU CERTAINLY NEED THE STANDARD BY AND JOB AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS FOR ARE BEING SELECTED BY OUR GOVERNOR TO TAKE THIS VERY IMPORTANT POSITION I DO HAVE YOU ANSWERED ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD IN MIND REGARDING THE TIMELINESS OF. THE OUR LICENSING AND THANK YOU FOR ALL WHATEVER IT TOOK PLACE THERE ON ON THE HOME FRONT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE APPLYING FOR LICENSURE ON THEY GOT A TIMELY RESPONSE TO THAT AND I AM SURE THAT TOOK A LOT OF WORK WHEN WE'VE BEEN ALL KIND OF HANDICAPPED WITH THE COLUMBIA. AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO ADMINISTRATIVELY DO HAVE ONE QUESTION IT'S REGARDING THE- THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE. WHEN YOU DO A- I'LL- WHEN SOMEONE FILES A HOW YOU UP THEIR ON THE DESK THE TRACKING OF THAT RIGHT NOW WHERE IT'S AND YOU CAN THEM NO- WITH- YOU'RE INVESTING AND THEN THE- AND I KINDA THE TIMELINE ON ALL OF THE WOULD BE HOW BE AT THE WHERE WE DO. RECEIVE ANOTHER OF THOSE AND JOB ALWAYS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REACH AND SHE THE AGENCY ITSELF AND TRY TO GET INFORMATION UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME WAY THAT YOU'RE POSTING THAT ARE KEEPING THEM INFORMED SO YOU'LL CLICK ON OVERVIEW FOR US ON HOW THAT WORKS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. CERTAINLY SO FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY WE DO INVESTIGATE ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE M. IT IS OUR REQUIREMENTTHAT OUR INVESTIGATORS TO KEEP COMPLAINTS UP TO DATE ON A REGULAR BASIS. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO THE DIALOGUE- REGARDING THE MEDICAL BOARD LAST WEEK AND IT DID GIVE ME A FEW IDEAS- WE DO NEED TO FORMALIZE THIS PROCESS AND PROVIDE SOME APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE SO THAT WERE INSURING THAT COMPLAINTS ARE INDEED UP THE DAHLE FREQUENT. REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. GET WORKING FOR THAT YEAH- YOU ANSWERED MOST OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I HAD IN MIND IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO APPRECIATE THAT. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER GLARED YOU WANNA. GO NEXT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR. OF A AND- ALSO CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR- YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THEN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OF FOR MEETING WITH ME YESTERDAY I REALLY APPRECIATED. AND YOU ANSWERED MOST OF MY QUESTIONS BUT THERE'S ONE I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOU OUT A LITTLE ONE AND THAT IS UNLICENSED ACTIVITY WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY ABOUT. HOW YOU DEAL WITH IT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD IF IN GENERAL YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT THE ACTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT TAKES TO GET OUT ON LICENSED ACTIVITY AND THEN I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT- THE PENALTIES AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO IT ONCE YOU GET THROUGH- JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE SUBJECT. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO OUR APPROACH ON UNLICENSED PRACTICE IS MULTI DIMENSIONAL WHAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE TO RELY ON- AS MANY MODES AS POSSIBLE TO GET AT THE PROBLEM AND FIND ABOUT ACTORS SO WE DO SEVERAL THINGS ONE. WE HAVE A CADRE OF STAFF WHO POLICE THE VARIOUS ONLINE PRESENCES FOR THE BAD ACTORS TEND TO POP UP WE ACTUALLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THEY'RE DEVOTING TO THIS EFFORT EVERY TIME WE DO AN INVESTIGATION AND WE TALKED TO- THE ACTUAL LICENSEES A VERY SCENARIOS WE ASK THEM WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR MARKETPLACE OTHER OTHER FOLKS WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF. WE DO THE SAME THING WHEN WE CONDUCT OUR AUDITS ADDITIONALLY ARE FORSMAN STAFF REACH OUT REGULARLY TO THE LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS OF REALTORS. AND ASK THEM ABOUT CURRENT TRENDS IN THE MARKET PLACE AND WHAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. IN THIS WORLD THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT- FUNCTION FOR US AND WE NEED TO TACKLE IT THROUGH AS MANY MEANS AS POSSIBLE. AND DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE ENOUGH STAFF RESOURCES TO GET AT THE LEVEL OF UNLICENSED ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE SEEING. TWO POINTS ONE. WE HAVE SUFFICIENTLY FORCE RESOURCES IF YOU LOOK AT OUR METRICS WE PERFORMED A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND MEET OUR STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO. ADJUDICATE COMPLAINTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC RESOURCES FOR UNLICENSED PRACTICE DIRECTLY YOU COULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH- I THINK WE DO A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. WE WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE MORE DOWN THE ROAD I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND CIRCLE BACK TO YOU SO THE PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON THROUGH. THE BUDGET PROCESS POTENTIALLY. AND DID I UNDERSTAND- YESTERDAY FROM OUR MEETING THAT THE FINES THAT ARE COLLECTED. AND I THINK IT MAXES OUT AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING DID I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO NOT COME TO YOU. SO THERE'S NOT THIS FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR YOU. TO GO AFTER UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS THAT CORRECT. LET ME CLARIFY- I NEED TO VERIFY WHETHER FISCAL STAFF BUT IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING TRADITIONALLY WITH LICENSING BOARDS THAT- THE PENALTIES THE MONETARY PENALTIES ARE INDEED DEPOSITED AND ARE FUND I THINK THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO ARTICULATE. AND I APOLOGIZE IF I WASN'T CLEAR- WAS SIMPLY THAT CITATIONS AND THE PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. ARE REALLY NOT A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM SO WE CAN HAVE A CITATION AGAINST UNLICENSED INDIVIDUAL. WITH A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PENALTY AND OUR OUR COSTS MORE ALL IN MIGHT BE. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT SO THEY'RE JUST. THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE A PENALTY AND IMPACTFUL BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO RECOVER FULL COVERAGE WOULD TODAY HAVE REALIZED ANY REVENUE FROM A FALL SALE. OF IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING MORE% MONEY THAN THE COST OF THE PENALTY FOR YOU JUST DEALING WITH THEM ON ON THE LICENSED WITHOUT THEM ACTUALLY HAVING ENGAGED IN A TRANSACTION. WE'RE WE'RE DEALING ON THE ON THE ON LICENSE THE OTHER REALM WHERE THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSABLE CRIMINAL OR CIVIL. AND THEN- LASTLY DO YOU THINK THE LEVEL OF THE PENALTY IS INADEQUATE A DETERRENT YOU'RE NOT SEEING SOMEBODY COME BACK AROUND BECAUSE THE PENALTY ISN'T ENOUGH TO REALLY DO ANYTHING BUT PASSED AWAY IN ONE SITUATION. THE CENTER I THINK YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE THAT THE NUMBER COULD POTENTIALLY. BE HIGHER BUT THERE'S A COFFEE GUY IT'S TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT IT'S TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACCOUNT SO IF I HAVE AN UNLICENSED. PERSON WHO DOES FIVE DONE DUMB UNSEEMLY THINGS WE CAN BRING THEM UP FOR FIVE CITATIONS AT. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IT WAS A SINGULAR COUNT THEN YOU MIGHT WANT SOMETHING MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS ACTUALLY COLLECTING IT BECAUSE THESE ARE LEGAL OPERATORS SO THEY'RE GONNA. CLAIM UNDERGROUND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FIND WE DO HAVE SOME TOOLS WE HAVE A COLLECTION AGENCIES WE HAVE. THE INTERCEPTOR OF RAM- WITH THE TAX AGENCIES BUT IT CERTAINLY COULD BE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT WIH RESPECT TO THE DOLLAR AMOUNT. IT WAS SET AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SOMETIME AGO I WOULD I WOULD ESTIMATE OVER TEN YEARS AGO. THANK YOU THIS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND IF YOU IT DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE WHY THAT. THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE FEEL FREE TO CIRCLE BACK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR POP MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM COULD AGAIN- COMMISSIONER CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT- ACTUALLY- CENTER LAYERED ASK QUESTION I WAS MOST INTERESTED IN- BUT LOOKING AT THE D. R. E. COSTS AND INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE YEAR AFTER THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF- D. R. E. SO IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY EIGHT THOSE COSTS ARE NOTABLE AND ARE THERE IT AND IF THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM IS OUR WAY TO ADDRESS IT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I AYE CENTER RIGHT I CAN'T DO WE NEED TO VERIFY WITH OUR FISCAL STAFF WHAT MAY HAVE DRIVEN THAT I SUSPECT A PIECE OF IT IS SIMPLY RETURNING BACK TO. DEPARTMENTAL STATUS THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF TRADE OFF- I WOULD ASSUME BETWEEN THE PRO RATA HE TO DCA AND THEN ALSO INCURRING THE COSTS DIRECTLY BUT I WOULD NEED TO FACT CHECK UP. OR YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU MR MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO RAISE TWO POINTS THAT WE RAISED IN OUR CONVERSATION PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. ON FIRST WE'LL AT THE END OF LAST YEAR'S I SUGGESTED TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR ON THE PAST LET IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LEGISLATION DEALING WITH THE ARE- FINANCIAL DISTRESS WORD LANDLORDS AND TENANTS- AS A RESULT YOU PREPARE YOUR OFFICE PREPARED THE DECLARATION FORM OF COVERT NINETEEN FINANCIAL DISTRESS I HAD OURS TAKE A STAFF OF TAKE A LOOK AT THE COPIES OF WHAT YOU PREPARED AND I FOUND HIM TO BE. ON PASSABLE IN THE SENSE THAT. AND I HEARD THIS SUBSEQUENTLY IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE STAFF SAID WELL THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATION SAID BUT WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING ANY LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY IS TO THE AUDIENCES WE IN THE LEGISLATURE DRAFT LAWS BUT- THOSE DID YOU NEED TO PUT THOSE PROVISIONS OF COURSE IN THE DOCUMENT. BUT YOU JUST THREW IT TOGETHER WITH NO SENSE OF CUSTOMER WHO YOUR CUSTOMER WAS WITH THE AGENCY DOES WITH ANY LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND EXPRESS THAT TO YOU BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. DISTRESS AND YOU NEED TO MAKE DOCUMENTS EASY TO READ ACCESSIBLE YES YOU NEED TO HAVE THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE HAS BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY THINGS THAT WE COULD DO IS A GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER. ON THE FOLKS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THIS RATHER THAN JUST TO HAND THEM SOME DOCUMENT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE YOUR LOGO ON IT DIDN'T HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOGO ON IT. JUST KIND OF SLOPPY TOGETHER NINE I FELT THAT THAT WAS SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING AND WE JUST THINK THAT IN ALL OF THESE THINGS WE DO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE INTERFACE WITH THE PUBLIC. WE THINK ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR CONDITIONS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY GET A DOCUMENT FOR A PIECE OF PAPER FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND MAKE IT IS EASY AND SIMPLE ON THEM AS POSSIBLE AND GO THE EXTRA DISTANCE BEYOND JUST THE MINIMALIST APPROACH WHICH WAS DONE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU DID IT PARTICULARLY HOW SENSITIVE THE SITUATION IS FOR THESE FOLKS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ON THE RECORD. IS THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THE TIME AND DO THAT THE SECOND THING. WAS THE WAIT TIMES FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY CALL AGAIN. PEOPLE ARE COMING IN THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM THEY'RE DISTRESSED YOU GOT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MINUTE WAIT TIMES NOW I UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER FACTORS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN. TRY TO- PUT SOME. ELBOW GREASE INTO THOSE THINGS AGAIN TO TRY TO PROVIDE. WHEN FOLKS ARE COMPLAINING OF THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM. THE LICENSE HERE WHATEVER. YOU WANT YOUR GOVERNMENT TO BE AS AVAILABLE AND IS RESPONSIVE AND AS RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE. AND I JUST THINK TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN WORK ON THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD TO THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SUPPORTING YOU TODAY BUT I JUST. WANT TO SHARE THOSE THOSE TWO ISSUES ON THE RECORD BECAUSE OF THE GUESTLIST. SO IMPORTANT THAT WE EXPRESS THAT LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY TO ALL WHO INTERFACE THEIR GOVERNMENT. AND MAKE IT THE MOST POSITIVE EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M COMMISSIONER DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT- THAT'S THE LAST QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO. MR HERTZBERG OF PLEASE DO. NOT JUST JUST BRIEFLY- I ENDORSE BOTH OF THOSE COMMENTS I'M FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE SPIRIT OF THOSE COMMENTS AND FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE- WITH RESPECT TO THE DOCUMENTS I'VE ACTUALLY EXPANDED OUR COMMUNICATIONS SHOP HERE AND SO ONE OF OUR- INITIAL TASKS FOR THEM IS TO ACTUALLY REVIEW ALL OF OUR CONSUMER MATERIAL AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S USABLE AND CURRENTS AND- EFFECTIVE- AND THAT'S DOUBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE HOUSING IS KEY INFORMATION- PARTICULARS TO THE- THE DECLARATION- ESTHER CALL WAIT TIMES YES ARE YOU.

ON YOUR APPOINTMENT ST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE I WAS LOOKING AT THE YEARS OF ARMS OVER THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE I HAVE YOU HAVE ALL OF THE TIME THAT YOU OFTEN GIVE A NOD TO THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT STUFF COMMISSION AND I KNOW ON GIVEN THE LAST A YEAR- CERTAINLY WOULD CALL ME CHALLENGES BUT ALSO WITH. THE CHALLENGES IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARENA THE OF. FOR IS SIX IMPORTANT THAT KNOW CHALLENGE YOUR SEATS BASED ISSUES RESTORE JUST. THAT OF LOCAL EASTER. AND ALL OF THAT. I'D LIKE TO SEE TO FIRST YOUR- SURGING ARE. WE WILL ANDREAS SERGEANT COMMISSIONER AND EVEN WE LIVE AND- THE OPRAH SERGEANT WERE NEAR US YOUR CURRENT- YOU WERE. THE R. KHARADI OF RED RESTRAINT. FOR THE CONCERN HAVEN'T SAFE ARE FOR THOSE OFFICER ARE MIKE BE AN EARLY AREA IN NEEDING A NEW NUMBER OF THE TRYING TO RESPOND TO ANY. MESSAGE THAT WERE IN WERE SOME WHO IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RISK SHE WERE COMES ABOUT THE- I RECEIVED A CALL WHEN INTO FIND. AN ALTERNATE ROUTE THAT COULD BE USED IN TRAIN WILL TRAIN IN ALL THE PREVIOUS TO ENSURE THAT YOU COULD BE SAVORING YOU'RE WAITING ARE A BACKUP SO COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE- TO THAT AND NOW WHAT THE AKAN DEALS OR WHAT MIGHT BE A PROCESS. BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A CONCERN YOU ARE YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUND OFFICER TRYING TO RESTRAIN NOT THE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS ON. INDIVIDUAL AND YOU DON'T THE TO- IN THE- EXIST. TO ENSURE OWN SAY. YEAH THAT WOULD LEAD TO OUR CORE PLEASE LEAVE FORCE AND I THINK WE- ALL HOPING THAT WE CAN. THE SHE BE JUST TO MAKE ON. THE LISLE THROW IT TO YOU BUT YOU SURE SOME THOUGHTS US. HOW WE GO. OR ALL THE WOMEN IN SERVICE IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU SENATOR NOT START WITH- SERGEANT OF- A LITTLE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SERGEANT RAMIREZ. SURE SURE THANK YOU- I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE CAROTID RESTRAINT DUE TO THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED- I'LL SWEAR IN THE COUNTRY. WHERE FOLKS HAVE HAVE. DIED WHILE IN CONTACT WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND- THAT THE CONCERN WAS OVER YOU KNOWTHE USE OF THE CROWDED RESTRAINT. BUT IT THINK AT ANY TIME- ANY TYPE OF FORCE. THAT IS USED OR APPLIED INCORRECTLY CAN BE FATAL SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T USE BATONS ON PEOPLE'S HEADS OR ON THEIR NEXT WE DON'T USED TASERS. ON THE ELDERLY- OR CHILDREN- BUT THIS DID CAUSE ME CONCERN BECAUSE WHENEVER WE TAKE A TOOL OR TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE- WE TAKE AWAY. WE TAKE AWAY AS OPTIONS. FOR US FOR OFFICERS AND THAT'S- TURNING ESPECIALLY WE'RE NOT READILY REPLACE THEM WITH. THAT IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER- AND I'M HOPING THAT. UP BECAUSE OF THIS DECISION TO DO AWAY WITH THE CAROTID RESTRAINT THAT IT CREATES. OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION- FOR US TO EXPLORE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE- THAT YOU KNOW WE BRING PEOPLE IN FROM- PROFESSIONS- YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL FIGHTERS OR THOSE WHO HAVE- INNOVATIVE TOOLS- SUCH AS I MEAN THAT THE TASER WASN'T HASN'T BEEN AROUND FOREVER BUT IT DID COME AROUND AT SOME POINT SO. IF SOMEONE BUT SOMEONE WERE TO CREATE OR INVENT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE USEFUL I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GO IN THE DIRECTION WHERE- WE'RE USING INNOVATION TO OUR ADVANTAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SERGEANT ROMERO'S. I AGREE WITH SERGEANT- WE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING THE MEETING DISCUSSING THAT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE TEACHING A LITTLE MORE GROUND FIGHTING- AND I OFFERED AT DIGITS TO AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE DO WE EXTEND THE ACADEMY DO WE MAKE IT HARDER TO MAYBE GETTING YOUR CERTIFICATE PRETTY IN A LITTLE BIT ON THE- TRAINEE THEMSELVES THAT. AS THEIR STARTING OUT THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOU MAKE IT MAY BE PART OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME GROUND FIGHTING RIGHT ALONG WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA FIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIND OF LATE SOMETHING TO REPLACE IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ANSWER IS RIGHT NOW R. I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT. THE QUICKER. FIX WOULD BE ARE YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME JUJITSU SKILLS WHERE YOU CAN. ACTUALLY GET YOURSELF IN A POSITION TO HOLD SOMEONE DOWN. LONG ENOUGH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TECHNIQUES YOU CAN HOLD SOMEONE LONG ENOUGH TO GET SOMEONE THERE TO HELP WELL THAT ALWAYS SOLVE THE PROBLEM NO THERE'S GONNA BE TIMES THAT WE HAVE TO USE LEGAL THAT WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO. HAVE A CHOICE BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT GOING FORWARD. THAT'S ONE THING WE SHOULD CONSIDER AND LOOK INTO AND SEE YOU KNOW. HOW THAT HOW COULD POSSIBLY INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE ACADEMIES. ARE MAKING MAYBE HAVING TO MAKE THE ECONOMY A LITTLE BIT LONGER OR- AS YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID MAKE IT MAYBE PART OF THE REQUIREMENT IT GETTING HIRED INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT- GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. SENATOR BATES OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE- USE OF LETHAL FORCE AND WHAT THAT HAS RENDERED JOHN TO THE PUBLIC OVER THE LAST A YEAR AND A HALF. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FINDING NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ENSURE PROTECTION ARE. ON THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS MY HIGHEST PRIORITY I THINK FOR ALL. SO THANK YOU FOR CALLING JUST INTRODUCING THE CONCERN AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON FINDING. AND I. ACTUALLY ON THINK THE- OFF MISSIONERS THAT ARE. LISTENING TAKING ON DAHLE CERTAIN WITH TODAY YOU ALL MY- SUPPORT LOOKING AT THE YEARS THAT YOU. DEVOTED TO THEIR OUTSTANDING YOU DON'T GET ANY COMPENSATION SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CASH YOUR NAY ON HOW CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE VERY HERE YOU. TO AND WILL BE SOLD PRESHEAF BACK. SO I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I WOULD JUST ASK THAT LISTENING TO YOU ON. OUR OTHER WOMEN OFFICERS HERE IN THE CONCERNS ON IT IS NOT LIKE IT IS ON TV WHERE SOMEONE THAT'S NINETY SIX POUNDS IS ABLE TO RESTRAIN A THREE HUNDRED. POUND PERSON ON THE GROUND AND ALL LOOKS WONDERFUL INSURANCE AFTER TAKING WE KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST SO. ALL OF YOU- FOCUSING AND DEDICATING TIME TO. JUST SOLVING THAT ISSUE I THINK IS GOING TO BE ON GREAT MAC THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICE YOU ARE OFFERING STATE. BUT WHAT THAT YOU ALL HAVE- MY STRONG ACROSS THE PORCH AND- I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING I'D- GET. TO THAT THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- MISTER. LEADER I AM THANK SO MUCH QUESTION ANSWER THANK YOU THANK ARE MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU VERY TEM AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR RE APPOINTMENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING TO CONFIRM I'M SURE THROUGH THIS QUESTION ON WHOEVER WANTS TO ADDRESS A CAN WE HAD A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS- IN NOT ONLY OUR BODY WITH THE STATE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR AS IT RELATES TO DECERTIFYING OFFICERS. SO RECOGNIZING THE POSTERS ON HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECERTIFY OFFICERS I'M INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS ON IF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SHOULD BE LICENSE ALREADY CERTIFIED BY STATE ENTITY AND IF SO DO YOU THINK POST IS THE RIGHT ENTITY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I ANYONE THAT WOULD WANT TO- RESPOND TO THAT CAN. FIVE I WILL IT I KNOW IT'S HARD WHEN THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE AT ONCE AND WE'RE NOT IN A ROOM WITH. GO AHEAD GOING AND PICKLE MISTER LONG OKAY OKAY. YOU KNOW OKAY. GO AHEAD MR LONG. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN IN THE CERTIFICATION AND- WE AS A COMMISSION HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS PRE COATED. AGING CONVERSATION AS AS MOST THE POST CONVERSATIONS GOES A GREAT DEAL CAN TAKE ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS HAD ASKED- THE STAFF TO DO A REPORT ON DECERTIFICATION THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO. A FORMER POLICE- OF A POLICE CHIEF WHO IS A FORMER MEMBER FALLS FOR A GREAT DISCUSSION I'M VERY INTRIGUED EMOTIONAL DECERTIFICATION I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PURSUE- IT'S IN THE DETAILS- OBVIOUSLY THERE IS QUITE. EXTENSIVE DEBATE OVER THIS LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND I ASSUME IT WILL BE AGAIN I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO. WHO DOES THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOW BIG OF A STRUCTURED YOU MOVED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL BOARD ADDITIONAL DIVISION YOU CAN POST IS NOT NOW AND NEVER HAS BEEN A TRIBUNAL SO THERE'S THAT ISSUE GIVEN TO ALSO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET ITO. WHAT WILL. BE A AN OFFENSE WORTHY OF DECERTIFICATION GETTING THE DEFINITIONS OF THE LIST OF OFFENSES ONCE YOU GO DOWN THAT ROAD OF LISTING OFFENSES- AS THOSE SORTS OF WORKING PUBLIC POLICY FOR MANY YEARS NOW THOSE LISTS ARE CROSS REFERENCING REFERRED TO FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. FIGURED BURKE CAREFUL ON HOW THOSE ARE DRAFTED I PERSONALLY THINK A CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN THE- BALANCE OF STATES I THINK IT'S- LIKE FORTY FIVE STATES WHO HAVE THE CERTIFICATION BUT I THINK THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS HERE. WHO IS TO DO THE- RESTRICTIONS SINCE TRIBUNAL. AND HOW YOU CAN DO THE DEFINITIONS. SO THAT'S MY TAKE MOMENT. THANK YOU MSTER. ARE ANYONE IS. WOULD BE A- IN YOUR CALL ON THIS. WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE- DISCUSSION THIS YEAR AND- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW THAT. SHARE NOW ARE STARTING DON JUAN THANK ONE OKAY GO AHEAD YOU YOU FIRST AND THEN I SAW SERGEANT ROMERO'S HAND AS WELL GO AHEAD. CHANCE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION I THINK AFFIRMATIVELY POSISI ABSOLUTE IDEAL. ENTITY WHEN THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT WHATEVER. THAT COMES OUT ALL COMES OUT OF MY LEGISLATION AT THE END OF THE DAY MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY THERE THROUGH. APPLE'S IMPLEMENTED. GIVEN THE WAY THAT THIS STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR STRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS. M. I THINK COMMISSIONER ALONG IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY I THINK THE ISSUE IS GOING TO BE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND HOW WE ACTUALLY GET TO A STRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR ALL BUT I THINK THAT I WOULD JOIN PROBABLY ALL THE- COMMISSIONERS AND POST IN SAYING THAT POSTED IS ABSOLUTELY READY TO TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE. AND FIND A WAY TO GET THIS DONE. THANK YOU SERGEANT I SERGEANT REMAIN. ED I WAS JUST GONNA ADD TO THE SAME THING REPLACED I THINK POST WOULD BE THE RIGHT PLACE I THINK YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TO CONSIDER RIGHT- PRESSURE LONG SAID THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS BUT ALSO I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO OPEN UP LIKE YOU KNOW THE STAFF BEING THEM PROPERLY AND GIVING THEM ANOTHER SAID THE UNIT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY WOULD BE TASKED WITH. THANK YOU COM ANYTHING FURTHER. OKAY THANK YOU MATT OKAY SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- REALLY THE SCOPE OF POSTERS IN TWO THINGS TRAINING AND POLICE PRACTICES AND SELECTION STANDARDS AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB OF SORT OF GETTING INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES OF TRAINING AND POLICE ARE PRACTICES SO I HAD ONE QUESTION I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH JEFF LONG AND THAT IS ON THE SELECTION STANDARDS I KNOW IN SOME WAYS IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS I KNOW IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE WROTE OR THEY'RE OUT THERE BUT HOW DO YOU DEAL. WITH THE ISSUES OF DIVERSITY IN RECRUITMENT OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AGAINST A SELECTION STANDARDS IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO THAT CAN FACILITATE THAT DIVERSITY OR THERE ARE THINGS YOU OF OBSERVE GENERATIONS THAT MIGHT BE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ARENA ON THAT. WELL THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED- I THINK SELECTION IS A HUGE ISSUE I THINK DIVERSITY IS A HUGE ISSUE IT IS NOT HERE TO FOR REALLY BEEN- AN ISSUE FOR POST BECAUSE THE SELECTION STANDARDS ARE LARGELY STATUTORY IN POSTAL WE'RE ON SOME ADDITIONAL STANDARDS MAYBE IN TERMS OF. EDUCATION OR OR- THINGS LIKE THAT AS VERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CARE ON TOP OF THAT BUT IN TERMS OF SELECTIONS ESPECIALLY REACHING OUT FOR DIVERSITY. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE REALLY GOT TO LOOK AT. THE NUMBERS- THE NUMBERS ARE- THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT- PURCHASE OF THE- POPULATION IS WHITE YOU KNOW AND BUT 52% OF- POLICE OFFICERS OR WHAT THE BIGGEST BY FAR- DISCREPANCIES WITH WOMEN ONLY ABOUT 14% OF THE SOURCES OF. WITH OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION WELL AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GREAT RAMIFICATIONS FOR I THINK WHOSE LEGITIMACY AND- TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY AND SO FORTH SO. WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO ENGAGE IN A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MORE DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF HIRING THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SOME EFFORTS- THE EEOC SAID- DEAL J. AS IN ADVANCING. SURE DIVERSITY TRAINING IN AND- SELECTION AND RECRUITMENT. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE DUE FOR POSTERS REALLY ENGAGED AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT- COMING FOR WHETHER IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A SEPARATE STATEMENTS OF INTENT OR WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO MAYBE EVEN DO. SOME TYPE OF- CERTAINLY TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES ARE DOING AND WHAT IS WHAT IS NOT ORANGE FRUIT WELL I SEE THAT. IT IS A MAN FROM WHAT YOU SAY POST DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DISCRETION BUT PULSE. COLLECTS DISTANT THE STATISTICS AND MONITORS THE SITUATION IN A WAY THAT YOU CONNECT TO VIA. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU JUST EXPRESSED IT MARKED REFLECT ON THIS I MEAN IS. IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE PROPOSAL. I DON'T WANT TO GET. TO INTO. OUR LEGISLATION BUT THERE'S ONE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD SORT OF LIFT THE AGE TO GO IN AND IT IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BASED ON STATISTICS DO YOU HAVE SOME VIEW THAT THAT WOULD AFFECT DIVERSITY AND SOMEONE. OUR PERSONAL VIEW ON THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN BUT I WOULD SAY THAT I DO AGREE WITH YOU CENTER THE POST IS IN POSSESSION OF STATISTICS AND WRITE AFFECTED THINKING APRIL. WHAT REPORT OUT THERE WILL BREAK DOWN THE ACADEMY'S- IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY AND THAT WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR PERSONAL I THINK WE SHOULD GO FURTHER. AND LOOK AT DEPARTMENTS DO SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING AND FIND OUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE VARIOUS BREAKDOWNS ARE AND WHAT'S WORKING IN TERMS OF THEIR- REACHING OUT IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY- IN TERMS OF RAISING THE AGE AS- RAGING EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. WELL THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE INTERESTING THINGS TO TALK ABOUT I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BY MAYBE THE M. TEN CONSEQUENCES OF ACTUALLY MAKING NARROWING. THE POPULATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T ACCOMPANY SUCH THINGS AS- ADDITIONAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS SAY COLLEGE DEGREES OR ORIGINALLY AGE TO TWENTY FIVE WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T ATTACHED TO THOSE THINGS- DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR REACHING OUT AND LOOKING AT THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE SEEKING IF WE DON'T TIE THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER I THINK THERE COULD BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF SUCH A BILL MY OWN JUST IN MY OWN OPINION TECH PARTNERSHIPS AT NIGHT. IF I HAVE TO RECOUNT A STORY AS USUAL AND- I WAS SPEAKING AT THE GRADUATION OF THE BATCH LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PARK RANGERS AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIVERSITY. AND THE FRONT THERE WERE FIFTY IN THE FRONT ROW THE SEVEN OF THEM WERE ALL WOMEN I WAS VERY EXCITED AND THEN I REALIZED. THAT THESE VERY SEATED. THEM IN ORDER OF THEIR HEIGHT. THERE WERE SEVEN WOMEN IN ENTIRE. THEY WERE IN THE ROW THEY WERE THE SHORTEST AND SO. THE SOME FOR DIVERSE. LET ME FLY CALL. AND I HATE TO DO THIS THE MAIL OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES BUT I KNOW THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE DID ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING THEY WISH TO ADD ON THAT ISSUE BEFORE WE MOVE ON. BUT SENATOR I WOULD SLIDE LIBRARY. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. YES THANK YOU YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE STRUGGLED WITH AS A PROFESSION FOR A VERY LONG TIME I MEAN EVEN. WHEN I STARTED IN- NINETEEN A CERTAIN A STUDENT TRAINEE ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO I WAS ONLY NINETEEN YEARS OLD WHEN MY AGENCY RECRUITED ME FROM THE LOCAL COLLEGE- AND I MEAN I'VE WORKED IT YOU KNOW TO HELP OUR RECRUITING A UNIT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND NOW WE STILL AREN'T AT THE LEVELS THAT WE WANT TO BE- BUT I THINK PART OF THAT. IS DUE TO SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH US SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES- IT IN OUR AREA I THINK THAT THAT. THAT'S THE SAME FOR A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION- WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE- RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- RECRUIT FROM WITHIN- SO. AS I DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND THE VALUE AND DIVERSITY BECAUSE I MEAN I'M HERE AND I UTILIZE MY AGE MY LANGUAGE SKILLS AND- EFFECTIVE A WOMAN ALL THE TIME. TO HELP ME BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS JOB BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE OVERALL- CONTINUING WITH THE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE THE- TRAINING SO THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED FAIRLY BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S HOW WE GET PEOPLE TO. ON SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUST IN US AS POLICE OFFICERS AND IN THIS PROFESSION SO THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO COME AND WORK HERE- IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON AND NO MATTER THEIR WHITE BLACK ASIAN OR WHATEVER TO YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE TO CREATE MISTRUST OR TO DESTROY IT IN A COMMUNITY- AND SO REALLY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS OR WHAT YOUR GENDER IS I THINK IT'S THE OVER OVERALL WAY IN WHICH WE TREAT PEOPLE THAT MATTERS MOST AND I THINK WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AND I THINK- SERGEANT RAMIREZ WANTED TO ALSO COMMENT ON THIS. YES HI I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF RECRUITING- WOMEN. AND MINORITIES OUT BY GOING ON THE FIELD BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S ANYTHING THAT'S HOST REALLY. ARM CAN CONTROL I THINK IT'S MORE ON THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES THAT THEY NEED TO GET OUT IN THE MORE. ARE DIVERSE AREAS- BUT KIND OF ON WHAT LINE I SAID YOU KNOW IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH THE COMMUNITY WHETHER THEY WANT TO LET YOU AND THEY'RE TO DO THINGS OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS DIFFERENT AGENCIES YOU CAN TRY. TO RECRUIT FEMALES AND THAT'S YOU KNOW GOING TO ALL WOMEN EVENTS LIKE YOU KNOW ALL WOMEN RUNS WELL WHEN BEFORE CALVET- BUT WE JUST NEED TO GET OUT THERE MORE AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET OUR WOMEN OUT THERE MORE. SENDING MEN OUT TO THOSE- TYPE OF EVENTS TO TRY TO QUIT- RECRUIT WOMEN DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THE BEST SO I THINK THAT. WE HAVE TO PUT A LOT MORE ON THE AGENCIES INDIVIDUALLY TO GO OUT AND I KNOW PERSONALLY OUR AGENCY TRIED TO RECRUIT WOMEN AND I'VE BEEN IN INTERVIEWS BEFORE WHERE THEY LIKE I KNOW I'M GOOD I DON'T. THIS REALLY ISN'T WHAT I WANT TO DO. HOW DO THEY GO TO ALL. SO I THINK IT'S JUST- A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT WHILE I SAID THAT I YOU KNOW. THE IMAGE THAT WE KEEP AND- MAKING WANTED. PEOPLE WANT TO DO THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY PRESS RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A- STRANGE TIME WHERE WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF. BAD PUBLICITY AND- THAT PERSON HAS A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING WHAT THEY THINK IS YOU KNOW A- PROFESSION WHERE WE'RE NOT. ARE DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO TRY TO. TRY TWICE AS HARD NOW TO RECRUIT. BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT STIGMA THAT WERE ALL UP AGAIN SO. I THINK GETTING WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR JUST GONNA BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT HAS BEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER THANK YOU- IT WILL TO FOLLOW ALONG ON THAT I KNOW THAT I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH FORMER COMMISSIONER STANLEY OF CHP AND WITH COMMISSIONER- RAY WHO HAS YET TO COME BEFORE US AND WILL- AT SOME POINT FOR CONFIRMATION- AS IT RELATES TO THE ACADEMY'S AND SOME OF THE TRAININGS THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES DONE THAT POINT TO. VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS THAT WORK FOR SOME- COMMUNITIES- THAT HAVE A DISADVANTAGED- SOME COMMUNITIES FOR INSTANCE THE DRIVING CRITERIA- I YEAH MY YEAH. MY STAFF- THAT COVERS ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE'VE GONE OVER THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IN MY MOST RECENT CONVERSATION WITH COMMISSIONER RAY I ASK ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY- TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T PASS A CERTAIN TRAINING AND THEY DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM THEY DROP OUT OF THE ACADEMY AND THERE TEND TO BE SOME TREND LINES IN TERMS OF- THE ETHNIC DIVERSITY ON THOSE THINGS- I DIDN'T THINK TO HAVE ALL THAT MATERIAL WITH ME TODAY BUT IT CAME UP AGAIN AT LEAST TWO TIMES WITH- FORMER COMMISSIONERS AT CHP WHEN WE ALWAYS ASK THAT QUESTION WHEN THE COMMISSIONERS COME IN. HOW ARE YOU WORKING ON DIVERSITY AND IT WOULD SEEM- THERE IS A ROLE ACTUALLY FOR POST- IN THAT BUT JUST TO COMMENT I DON'T I DON'T NEED- THAT ANSWERED- BUT I DO WANT TO ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT. QUESTION DO YOU BELIEVE THERE ARE ACCURATE OR VERIFIABLE WAYS TO IDENTIFY BIASED OFFICERS ACTUALLY BEFORE YOU HIRE THEM AND- ARE MOST OF THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT- COMMISSIONERS HERE HAVE QUITE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD IMAGINE. YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AND I WOULD I WOULD ACTUALLY ASK OUR- AGAIN IT'S SO HARD TO. ASK PEOPLE JUST WANT TO RESPOND. LET ME JUST GO DOWN THE LIST AND ASK- SERGEANT PARTICULARLY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ONCE BUT MISTER LONG YOU CAN CERTAINLY ANSWER IF YOU'D LIKE- A SERGEANT OF- A LITTLE COMMENTS ON IF YOU'RE ABLE TO. DETERMINED THAT. THE HIGHER YOUR TO YOUR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BIAS RIGHT YES I'M SORRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME I THOUGHT I SAID BIASED OFF YES YES IMPLICIT BIAS. SO WE I MEAN EVERYBODY EVERYBODY HAS A BIAS IT'S MATTER OF US TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE THAT BIAS RIGHT CAN'T GET UNDER CONTROL RIGHT NOT USING THAT WHILE WE'RE AT WORK- BUT YOU KNOW WE- THE OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING PRIOR TO- YOU KNOW BEING ACCEPTED INTO THE ACADEMY SO I AM. BUT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT THIS THERE HAS BEEN EMPHASISED- AND THAT SCREENING PROCESS TO ROOT OUT BIAS- IF NOT THEN THAT'S SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. AS YOU KNOW POST NEEDS O LOOK AT AND- PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON IT ARE AT WE DO PROVIDE AS YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW- THE- THE BIAS TRAINING. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE WERE ALREADY SWORN- JUST SO THAT WE CAN. BRING THAT ATTENTION TO EVERYBODY AND YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT WERE RECOGNIZING THAT WITHIN OURSELVES AND TO DEAL WITH IT PROPERLY. THANK YOU SERGEANT DONLAN DO YOU WANNA COMMENT. YES MADAM CHAIR I WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION PERFORMING VERSION WILLIAM BUT YEAH I REALLY JUST FEEL THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CANDIDATE AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE ACADEMY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THEM IT'S NOT JUST IN. EUROPE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING IS ANY INDICATION WHATSOEVER BIAS IN THE BACKGROUND THEY HAVE NO PLACE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AB RESPECTIVELY FROM THAT ONCE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SERVING AND YEAH AGENCIES I THINK I'VE DONE A GOOD JOB MAKING VERY CLEAR THAT BIASES ON ACCEPTABLE AND POST HAS ALSO BEEN ON THE VANGUARD IN PROMULGATING AT PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AS A WAY TO. ADD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AND ENSURE THAT AT WE ADDRESS IT IMMEDIATELY AND- I THINK THAT. YEAH CATION IS CAN CHANGE TO. DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE AND LIKE A LOT OF WERE ABOLISHED AND AS LONG AS I MESSAGES IT HAS NO PLACE IN OUR PROFESSION AND IF IT COMES IF IT'S DEMONSTRATED PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW BUSINESS WHEREIN ACT UNIFORM ABOUT YOUR SERVICES CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SERGEANT SERGEANT O'ROURKE YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION ON THERE THAT THROUGHOUT THE BACKGROUND PROCESSES THINGS POPS UP THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE THROUGH THE BACKGROUND- AS WELL AS AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THEIR ACADEMY IF ANYTHING RISES TO THEIR THAT IS JUST ANOTHER. REASON TO SPOTLIGHT THAT CANDIDATE AND SEE IF THEY'RE UP TO THE CRITERIA THAT NEEDS- WELL WITH THE PROPER BACKGROUND AND- AND VALUES ARE BECOMING LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. SERGEANT ROMERO'S ANYTHING. YEAH I THINK THAT THERE'S WAYS TO KIND OF SCREEN THESE THINGS BEFORE WE EVEN YOU KNOW GET INTO THE PROCESS AND I THINK IT GOES BACK WITH AGENCIES ON HOW THEY'RE TESTING QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING ARE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND JUST REALLY BRIEFLY I GET A SMALL STUDY ON MY OWN WITH A- CLOSE VIDEO. OF A TRAFFIC STOP AND JUST RANDOMLY ASK MY EMPLOYEES AS THEY WERE WALKING BY. WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT GOT THEIR OPINION AND- IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS OF BEING GAUGE MAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OR NOT BUT IT'S WITH A TRAFFIC STOP WITH A WHITE OFFICER AND- BLACK DRYBURGH BLACK YOUNG MAN. AND THAT RIGHT THERE GAVE ME AN INDICATION. IT WAS IN THE JAIL SETTING UP WHAT PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO SEE WHERE FORWARD AS DEPUTIES AND WHAT ONES WERE. PROBABLY NOT SUITED FOR IT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SO IT JUST MAKES ME THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT. BEFORE ANYBODY GETS IN THE PROCESS AND WE START SPENDING THE MONEY AND TRYING TO HELP THEM SURVIVE- WHEN WILL NEED TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS COME UP LATER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER LONG I DON'T LEAVE YOU OUT OF THIS. QUESTION Q. I. INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT- PROFESSIONALS FIRST BUT YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL ALSO IN TERMS OF YOUR OBSERVATION SO THOUGHTS. I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD IT WOULD THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SUPPOSED TO STAY N TOP OF THIS IS KIND OF MOTION OF THIRD PARTY VALIDATION. OF POST RAGS ON TOP OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE- REQUIRE SPECIFIC ORAL. ORAL INTERVIEWS BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION PSYCH INVESTIGATIONS AND SO FORTH SO. WE'RE COVERED ON THAT THE QUESTION IS EFFICACY AND THERE SHOULD BE SEEN OUR TRUCKS GOING FORWARD HOW TO MEASURE IN ORDER TO DO SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION SO MORE RESEARCH CAN BE DONE. FICTIVE EXISTING ROADS ARE IN ONE WAY TO DO THAT I THINK WOULD BE YOUR FAULT ALL THE I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THIRD PARTY VALIDATION WHETHER IT'S- ACADEMIC. ACADEMICS- HERE IS A OR WHAT BUT IT THINK IN THIS CASE THIRD PER CALLED A FROM THEIR- WOULD. GIVE US SOME WINDOW INTO HOW EFFECTIVE- REQUIREMENTS ARE MEETING UP THESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD JUST SAY IN TERMS OF POST- AND YOUR MISSION STATEMENT OUR STATED MISSION- IN TERMS OF- THE PROFESSIONALISM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVING COMMUNITIES.

ENCOURAGES NEW IDEAS EXPLORES AND USES APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES DELIVERS RELEVANT CLIENT BASE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. WHEN YOU MARRY THAT MISSION WITH A CHANGING SOCIETY AS WE HAVE SEEN CHANGING KIND OF MORES AND LEVELS OF EXPECTATION FROM THE PUBLIC OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. I WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT THAT AS WE GO TO THE- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO TEST OF FIVE BECAUSE- I'M INTERESTED- YOU KNOW HOW FAR AHEAD DOES PUBLISHED. GET AHEAD OF COMMUNITY AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU. ARE BEING DRIVEN BY COMMUNITY TO THEN MOVE FORWARD IF THAT'S A UNDERSTANDABLE CONCEPT TO MAKE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE FINAL WORD. ON THAT YEAH IN TERMS OF THOUGHTS BUT I'LL GIVE YOU TIME TO COLLECT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF OUR EXPECTATION OF WHAT POST IS MEANT TO OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR A NUMBER OF DECADES. I RECALL AS THE AS A STAFF MEMBER TO A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER HEARING ABOUT POST AND TALKING TO POLICE OFFICERS ON THE GROUND IN SAN DIEGO ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT AND THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO- AND HERE WE ARE DECADES LATER AND THERE'S A CHANGING PERSPECTIVE FROM COMMUNITY.
