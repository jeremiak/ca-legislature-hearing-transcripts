YES JERRY BROWN BRAZIL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH INCOME AS WAS MENTIONED WE WERE ASKED TO READ THE SENATE DEMOCRAT BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE REMARKS LARGELY ROOF- WILL REFLECT WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE AGENDA. AND GIVEN THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ARE RELATIVELY NEW TO US AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BUT WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO STAFF MEMBERS AS NEEDED- I'M SO AS NOTED IN ISSUE ONE IN THE AGENDA THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PUTTING WEALTH BACK TO WORK PLAN PROPOSES TO ONE. RETURN FUNDING TO TWO THOUSAND NINE LEVELS TO BEGIN THE RESTORATION OF BASIC OLDER. ADULTS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TO ESTABLISH A COORDINATED EFFORT TO RECRUIT TRAIN AND RETAIN VOLUNTEERS REQUIRED BY STATUTE FOR SENIOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS OLDER RIGHT TO PROTECTION IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. NAVIGATION ENROLLMENT IN MEDICARE TAX COUNSELING ASSISTANCE FOR THE ELDERLY AND EXPECTORANT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CLAY COUNTY WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SENIORS COUNCIL AREA ASSOCIATION AGING OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU AND I'M ALSO WEARING A COUPLE OTHER HOUSE TODAY ONE OF THOSE INCLUDES BEING THE LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND I ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PROPOSAL SEE FOR A REALLY LOOKED AT WHAT IS MEANINGFUL AND MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WHAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST AND WHERE DO WE START OFF AND MAKING SURE THAT. OUR THIS PROJECT MOVES TO SUCCESS SO THE OBVIOUS ONES ARE WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY RESTORING SOME PROGRAMS ARE THE FUNDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINE I GREAT RECESSION THAT HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND WERE ELIMINATED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE DOLLARS WENT THERE THOSE FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES THE FIRST OF WHICH IS LITERALLY THE ENTIRE ORDER CALIFORNIANS ACT AND JUST IN A NUTSHELL I WOULD SAY THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS THAT. WAS ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL MASTER PLAN FOR AGING BACK WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS SEEN AS AN INNOVATIVE LEADER NATIONWIDE IN EACH PROGRAMS SO WE'RE HOPING THAT WITH THE CURRENT MASTER PLAN THAT WE WILL GET BACK TO THAT STATUS AND WE THINK THE FIRST STEP IN IT IS JUST GETTING US BACK TO EVEN GETTING US BACK TO TWO THOUSAND NINE LEVELS AND THEN WE CAN BUILD ON THAT. ALTHOUGH CAL. ACT A VARIETY PROGRAMS THAT HELP SENIORS IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES IN THESE INCLUDED FOOD DELIVERY I ACTUALLY GROCERY STORE HOMES RATHER THAN HOT OR FROZEN MEAL. I CASE MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE WE COULD JUST PROGRAM WHICH DID EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT CONNECTED SENIORS IN NEED TO THE SERVICES THAT COULD HELP THEM. GET WHAT THEY NEEDED A DAY CARE I'M NOT A MEDICAL SOCIAL DAY CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA WHICH OFFERED A LOW COST OPERATING ON ALTERNATIVE TO I'LL BE MORE PROFESSIONAL SEA BASS PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. THE RESPITE SERVICES AND A COUPLE OTHER SIMILAR PROGRAMS. AS THE PARTNER TO THIS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT RESTORING OLDER AMERICANS ACT MATCH TO FEDERAL PROGRAMS AROUND TITLE THREE B. OR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. FOR THIS EXERCISE WE'RE CALLING THAT AGING IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THESE PROGRAMS DO THEY ALLOW SENIORS TO AGE IN PLACE AND THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO INFORMATION. OR TRANSPORTATION TO GET PEOPLE TO THE LOCATIONS I'VE OFTEN SAID THAT SERVICES DON'T EXIST THAT NOBODY HAS A WAY TO GET THERE TO THEM. AND THEN SOME ADDITIONAL- IMPORTANT SERVICES SUCH AS LEGAL PROTECTION. FOR HOME REPAIR CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE PERSONAL CARE. IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS AND TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN THE- LOCALE THAT THE PERSONS LIVING AND THAT'S A POINT. WITH BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE. IS THE TRUE BEAUTY IN THEM IS THERE FLEXIBILITY IN THAT THESE ARE STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES WITH THE LOCAL CHOICE ON HOW BEST TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUR COMMUNITY. BEST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOUR COMMUNITY AND MAYBE NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE OR THE CONTRARY. TO THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE AT ALL IN YOUR MUSIC B- ANNA DESPERATELY NEEDED A WHY I LIVE TO POINT OUT ON THIS IS THAT AND ALLOW. TRIPLE A.'S LIKE MINE THAT OPERATE IN BOTH A SUBURBAN AREA IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY VERSUS A RURAL AREA IN SAN BENITO COUNTY TO CUSTOMIZE OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT EACH OF THOSE COMMUNITIES- UNIQUELY TO THEIR CHALLENGES. PERSIST TRYING TO DO WHAT IS DONE IN L. A. COUNTY OR TRYING TO DO WHAT IS DONE IN. EXTREME OUR FRONTIER COUNTIES WHERE SERVICES CAN BE AS BASIC AS NEEDING SOMEBODY TO CHOP WOOD FOR SOMEBODY FOR THEIR WOOD BURNING HOME THAT CAN NO LONGER DO THAT. THIS FLEXIBILITY IS JUST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO PROGRAM SUCCESSES AND WE NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF NEEDING TO ADJUST PROGRAMS AND THAT'S THINGS LIKE THE KOBE. AND THE CODE OVER. THEM THANK IS SUPER EASY IT IS. A DIFFERENT PANDEMIC THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT ABOUT SENIOR SERVICES AND THAT IS LONELINESS AND ISOLATION LONELINESS AND ISOLATION IN OLDER ADULTS WAS ALREADY AT A CRITICAL STAGE WE CODE HERE. AND WHILE I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS AND THE DEATHS THAT KOBE YEAH. ALL OF US HAVE HEARD THOSE. THIS NUMBERS FOR OLD ROAD. WHEN WANT TO FILE WHAT IT DID TO ISOLATION AND ENGAGEMENT OF SENIORS IN THAT IS THAT A POPULATION THAT ALREADY WASN'T CONNECTING. DRIVEN FURTHER INTO COPPER AND FURTHER DISENFRANCHISE FROM THE COMMUNITY AT ALL. AND NO PLACES THAT SCENE BETTER THAN VOLUNTEERS. AND WE ALSO HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIES SHOW THAT NOTHING COUNTERS ISOLATION OR LONELINESS BETTER THAN VOLUNTEER. THAT'S THE ULTIMATE CURE FOR BEING SOCIALLY ISOLATED OR NOT ENGAGE OR KEEPING ONE'S MINE SHAR SO I HAD A TIME WHEN PROGRAMS. ARE WHEN THE DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES ARE GREATER THAN EVER. AND WHEN SERVICES ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED LIKE TAX ACCOUNTING FOR THE ELDERLY. OR HEALTH INSURANCE MEDICARE NAVIGATION THE REQUIRED TO USE HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONAL LEVELS ARE. VOLUNTEERS TO PERFORM THEIR WORK. SUDDENLY ALL THESE VITAL VOLUNTEERS AREN'T ABLE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY SO WE END UP WITH THE DOUBLE WHAMMY IN AND WE'VE HEARD STORIES- SOME DOCUMENTED ABOUT PROGRAMS LIKE- BUT IT'S BEEN THE SAME FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE- LOCALLY ONE OF OUR AGENCIES ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PROGRAMS USES VOLUNTEERS THE MINOR HOME REPAIRS THEY'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED CONTRACTORS THAT DID THIS WORK NO LONGER COULD SAFELY. SO THE VOLUNTEER PROGRAM PROPOSAL IS AN EFFORT TO COORDINATE THAT EFFORT TO BRING BACK VOLUNTEERS AND CONNECT THEM WITH THESE CRITICAL SERVICES. BUT IT'S TRULY THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION AND BASS. FOR FEARING KNOWN AS AN ISOLATION IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THE VOLUNTEERS BENEFIT MORE FROM VOLUNTEERING ON AVERAGE THAN THE PEOPLE THAT RECEIVE THEIR SERVICES. SO WE'RE URGING ON BOTH THESE THOSE THINGS TO BE FOUND. ON THE DISCUSSION TODAY DOESN'T INCLUDE FOOD BUT IN MANY WAYS OUR PROPOSAL FOR MEALS IS PART OF A RESTORATION EFFORT ALSO WE KNOW A LOT OF MONEY FLOW FORWARD WITH KOBE. AND FOOD PROGRAMS NUTRITION PROGRAMS HOME DELIVERED MEALS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE GOING TO DRY OUT. AND WHEN THEY DRY OUT THE SENIORS RECEIVING THESE MEALS FOR GOING TO BE JUST AS HUNGRY AS EVER THEY'RE GOING TO NEED JUST AS MUCH TO ME AS THEY EVER HAVE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE AUGMENTIN FUNDING ASK FOR NUTRITION AND BACK FILLED OUT FOR THAT'S ABOUT TO BE CREATED AND ALSO. ADDRESS THE UNMET HUNGER NEEDS. IN OLDER ADULTS THAT ALREADY EXISTS. SO WHERE PROPOSED THIS MULTI. A BUDGET AUGMENTATION AS OUR IDEA FOR THE BEST FIRST STEPS FOR MASTER PLAN FOR AGING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MANY COMPONENTS TO IT BUT STARTING WHERE WE LEFT OFF WHERE WE HAD SUCCESS SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD STARTING POINT. AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS ONE SAYING THAT FOR YEARS ONE OF OUR TALKING POINTS HAS BEEN WE NEED TO ENGAGE. AN INCREASE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE NEED TO ELEVATE THAT CONVERSATION AND WE HAVE DONE IT WE SHOULD ALL CELEBRATE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATURE NO AGING ISSUES BETTER THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEFORE SO WE HAVE THAT SUCCESS BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR TRUE WORK STARTS NOW BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE ISN'T REALLY THIS ELEVATE THE CONVERSATION. THE CHALLENGE WE NEED IS TO ELEVATE THE ENGAGEMENT IN L. E. INVESTMENT IN OLDER ADULTS IN ADULT SERVICES SO WE HUMBLY SUBMIT THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR FOLLOW QUESTIONS YOU'D LIKE TO MEET ME TO ADDRESS THE HAPPY TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CAMPERO YOUR YOUR DEDICATION AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM. CERTAINLY COMES THROUGH- SO. HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH MORE IS TO PRESENT WESTERN ANYTHING NEW WE'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO FUND WHAT WE'VE BEEN FUNDING AT A AT HIGHER LEVELS. SO HOW MUCH MORE WILL WE BE ABLE TO DO AND IS THIS IS A- BUDGET PROPOSAL CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WE WANT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE. BUT HOW DO WE ALSO THEN WORK IN- SWING WHN SO LIKE SANTA CRUZ. DO THEY FEEL BECAUSE WELL ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AS AS PEOPLE DO AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES AND HOW DO WE KNOW OF HOW DO WE KNOW THOSE RESOURCES. ARE ADEQUATELY AND- A FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT A GREAT QUESTION- I THINK PART OF HOW WE DO THAT IS THAT. IS MAKING SURE THE TRIPLE A.'S PROVIDE ANNUAL QUARTERLY EVEN MONTHLY UPDATES AS TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE DOLLARS. AND FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING AUGMENTED THAT EXIST THAT'S REALLY EASY TO DO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY SET. FOR THE PROGRAMS I'VE BEEN GONE FOR A DECADE CLASS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE REINVIGORATED BUT AGAIN. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DID. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WITH GREAT SUCCESS SO I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY IS A KEY PART OF THIS. SHOWING THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING THE DOLLARS AND HOW THE DOLLARS ARE. ARE MATCH WITH NUTRITION IT'S EASY WE CAN EQUATE THAT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL RESULT IN ABOUT SEVEN MILLION MEALS. FOR SOME OF THESE OTHERS IT'S TRICKIER IN THAT. GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY WHICH WE ALL LIVE IT'S HARD TO PREDICT SERVICE UNITS BECAUSE PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES WHILE IT MAY HAVE A TEN HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR IMPACT. ON AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT ONLY BE ONE SERVICE UNIT THAT GETS THERE IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE. TO PROVIDE SOMETHING LIKE AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS TO DELIVER A BAG OF GROCERIES TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE. SO WHEN I WAS PUTTING THIS TOGETHER I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT HOW DO WE PUT. NUMERALS YOU KNOW HAVE A BUTTON WIDGET NUMBERS TO EACH PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AND UNTIL THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS ARE MADE I DON'T THINK WE CAN ACCURATELY PREDICTS. WHAT THE TOTAL SERVICES BETTER I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT COST PER UNIT IN THE IN THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF ESTIMATE. ARE PROBABLY BE MORE UNPRODUCTIVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS DONE A DECADE OR MORE AGO AND THEN DOUBLE THE COST SIMPLY BECAUSE INFLATION IS COPPER BABY DOUBLE THE IMPACT AT THE SAME TIME. I'M VOLUNTEERS AND I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN MEASURE POLICY. BOUNCE HERE ISM IS THE VALUE OF THE TIME DEDICATE. SO NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS IS ONE THING. BUT THE WORK THE VOLUNTEERS STATUS CAN'T BE MEASURED AND THERE ARE- TAX GUIDELINES TO DO THIS THAT SOMEBODY IS A VOLUNTEER TAX PREPARER FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S ESTIMATED AS A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FOR OUR- VALUES. WERE IS IF SOMEBODY IS JUST DOING OFFICE. WORK AND MAILING OUT ENVELOPES OR NOTICES THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE CATEGORY SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE REALLY INTERESTING. TOOL TO LOOK AT THE SUCCESS IS MEASURING NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS BUT. THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THEY PERFORM. OKAY ALSO YOU HOW WE ARE WE ARE A EXCITED THIS AND THE BUDGET AND- BOTH REALLY WANTED TO ELEVATE ISSUES AROUND AROUND AGING THIS YEAR SO- WE THANK YOU FOR- FOR THIS PRESENTATION AND THIS ANSWERS AND THANK YOU TO THE L. A. O. FOR READING THIS- FOR US AND WE WILL- WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE GREAT FOUNDATION THAT THAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE ELECT ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER FUNDS THE PREVENT PREVENTING AND WE HAVE A CHIEF DATA STRATEGIST I THINK BRIAN GILLETTE MISTER LET ME HEAR AND RATED AGAIN I AM HERE OKAY AND BEFORE- MISTER JULY- PROCEEDS WITH THE PRESENTATION I JUST LIKE TO GET A QUICK OPENER WELL SURE AND THANKFULLY IT'S HOW AND THAT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND THE DEPARTMENT. TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION ON OUR SPRING FINANCE LETTER PROPOSALS WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE BUDGET INVESTMENTS PROVIDED THIS YEAR THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO GROW OUR PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE CRITICAL SAFETY NET SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'D ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES AND THE WORK BEHIND THE SCENES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT- AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH CRITICAL RESOURCES. TO CONTINUE TATIAN AND- OF OUR FROM THAT SERVE OUR WHOLE POP. AND CAL. SO WITH THAT AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MR GILLETTE WELL. PRESENT ON THE FIRST OPPOSE ALL ANSWER ANY THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HER FOR SHE ADDED OKAY MISTER GILLETT ARE YOU READY TO GO. I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO I'M HERE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER REQUESTS- SO CSS IS REQUESTING ONE FULL TIME PERMANENT SUPERVISING SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR TO FULL TIME CURRENT SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS AND ONE. FULL TIME PERMANENT ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST. THE COMBAT EVER INCREASING THIRD PARTY ELECTRONIC BENEFIT EDT THAT. AS WELL AS OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTNCE FRAUD IS NOT BEING INVESTIGATED CURRENTLY DUE. TO A LACK OF RESOURCES STATEWIDE. RECIPIENTS OF CALFRESH IN CALORIES RECEIVE THEIR IN CASH BENEFITS EDT CAR. WHICH CAN THEN BE USED AT ATMS AND POINT OF SALE DEVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RECENTLY WE'VE NOTICED THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THIRD PARTY STAFF TO BE T. BENEFITS. THEY'RE BOTH SKIMMING AD SCANNING SCANNING IS A FORM OF ELECTRONIC THEFT IN WHICH A MALICIOUS ACTOR PLACES- DEVICE ON A POINT OF SALE TERMINAL THAT CAPTURES THE CARD INFORMATION CARDS THAT ARE BEING SCANNED AT THAT TERMINAL. SKIMMING OCCURS WHEN A MALICIOUS ACTOR USES SOCIAL ENGINEERING IT TO MANIPULATE CARDHOLDERS INTO DISCLOSING THEIR CARD INFORMATION. IN BOTH INSTANCES- THAT MALICIOUS ACTORS CAN THEN USE THE CARD INFORMATION TO CREATE A CLONE CARTY IN DOT ON BENEFITS. OFF OF THE RIGHTFUL CARDHOLDERS ACCOUNT. OVER THE PAST EIGHTY MONTHS THIRD PARTY BEST OF AB T. BENEFITS HAS INCREASED FROM ABOUT. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH AND OVER THE PAST TWO. STATE THIS FOR YEARS TO- IN ORDER MAGNITUDE OF BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER MONTH IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. CURRENT STATUTES IN PARTICULAR AB TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN MANDATE THAT THE STATE REPLACE BENEFITS THAT WERE STOLEN BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE RESULTING TASK CASH REIMBURSED REIMBURSEMENTS ARE PAID FROM THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. IN ADDITION FOOD THEFT REIMBURSEMENTS ARE ALSO ADDED DUE TO THE OUTCOMES OF YOUR TICKET RESTAURANTS IN COURT FINDINGS ARE ALSO PAID FROM THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. OFFERED WHILE FOOD REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS ARE NOT AS HIGH AS THE CASH SIDE THE THEFT IN THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO GROWING. THE PROPOSED REVISIONS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT AND DETER THE THEFT OF U. P. T. BENEFITS FROM VULNERABLE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES. ALL PROVIDE CSS AND DEDICATED ABILITY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS THESE RESOURCES WOULD ALSO LAST CSS TO ADDRESS THAT IN INCREASING EBT THEFT IN CALIBRATION CALTRANS. COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES AND PROTECTORATE FOR BEING VICTIMIZED EXPERIENCING LOSS BENEFITS. THE STAFF WILL MONITOR INVESTIGATE IN SUPPORT PROSECUTION THIRD PARTY TO THEFT AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS AT THE STATE LEVEL WHILE ALSO PURSUING ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO REDUCE FUTURE THEFT ACTIVITIES. WITHOUT HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS IN THE HOUSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THERE THE COMMENTS OF THIS TIME YOU L. A. L. RYAN ANDERSON OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NO QUESTION THIS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER WHAT WHAT WE THINK WHY DO WE THINK BUT WE HAVE THIS IS PRETTY MASSIVE UPTICK. TO BE HONEST WE DON'T TOTALLY KNOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO- WE THINK THAT IN THE PAST PREDOMINANTLY THIS THE STAFF HAD BEEN. PRIMARILY INDIVIDUAL ACTORS THAT WERE- SORT OF ACTING ON THEIR OWN THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE NOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME MORE COORDINATION GOING ON- SO THERE'S SME EVIDENCE THAT IT'S PERHAPS THAT ORGANIZED CRIME RINGS THAT ARE GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS ONGOING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND SO WE'RE HOPING NOT LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THOSE AND HOPEFULLY FRIEDMAN THAT. CHECK SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN- PERPETRATING A FRAUD SO FAR THAT WILL. BUT DENTON IN THESE BIG NUMBERS THAT WE'RE SEEING OKAY AND THE AND THE NUMBERS ARE THE THEY WERE REQUESTING. FOR CRIMINALS. FOR PROSECUTION TO STOP IT OR TO DETECT IT. SO THE BEES RESOURCES WOULD SUPPORT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SO I'M ON THE FRONT AND THEY WOULD BE SUPPORTING THAT UPFRONT INVESTIGATIONS. IT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE- AND IN SOME CASES THE PARTICULAR SCANNING DEVICES IT CAN BE HARD TO LOCATE WHERE THOSE. DEVICES ARE THE WAY THEY WORK IS THAT IS THAT PLACED ON TOP OF THE TERMINAL YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE. THAT YOU'D START SWIPE YOUR CARD THROUGH THEM SO SOME OF THE WORK IN THIS TEAM WOULD BE. CONDUCTING ANALYSIS OF OUR EXISTING DATA TO TRY TO FIND PATTERNS AND- SEE IF WE CAN FIND. YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD AND- AFTER THE CAR MAKER. YOUR ARTICLE IN PLACES THAT THEY VISIT IN THE PAST THAT MAY INDICATE THAT THERE IS ANY DEVICE THERE- IN SO DOING SOME OF THAT UP FROM PREVENTIVE WORK WE MAY BE ABLE TO THEN FIND THOSE DEVICES AND REMOVE THEM. TO PREVENT FUTURE PEOPLE FROM. YOU CAN CHECK INTO THAT. BUT THEN ALSO ON THE BACK AND SUPPORTING STATE LEVEL INVESTIGATIONS ONCE WE DO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT- THANKS. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE FULL RESOURCES TO PURSUE AND PROSECUTE THOSE CASES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS THAT YOU MISTER GILLIGAN OR SO IT'S GOING TO BE A IN THE SHORT STEP THE DIRECTORS THAT CORRECT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME DANTE SHORT FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION. IS REQUESTING. STOP SERVICE MANAGER ONE SPECIALIST POSITION TO REVIEW AND RESPOND TO STATEWIDE TRENDS AND EMERGENCY AND WHILE BEING CONCERNED FOR CHILDREN INVOLVED ARE TROUBLED- THAT. BY JENNIFER TRÊN IN THAT AND SOME OF THE STATE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX ARE EXPERIENCING STAYS IN SHELTERS BEYOND THE MAXIMUM TIME PERMITTED AND MANY OF HER STAYING AN EXTRA YEAR TNCS ARE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM. LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS. ONE SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT CONCERNS SUCH AS THESE ARE IDENTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT REDRAFT BACK FROM THEIR EXISTING CRITICAL WORK FOR TEMPORARY PERIODS TO CONDUCT REVIEWS AND ANALYSES. AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT IN RESOLVING THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. THE THREE DIRECTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO MEANINGFULLY PERFORMING OVERSIGHT BUT THEY ALSO IMPACTS. OTHER WORK IN THE LIVER OF ALL. IN A POSITION FOR RECALL. WOULD ALLOW OF TO CREATE A DEDICATED RESPONSE TEAM THAT WOULD PLAN FOR AND MANAGE THE SITUATION AND ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PROACTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS MAINTAIN HEALTHY TEETH GROUT CALIFORNIA. THE PROPOSAL WOULD SUPPORT INTERACTIONS WITH HIGH LEVEL PARTY'S REGARDING SENSITIVE SUBJECT AREAS AND ALSO MITIGATE THE COST AND COMPLICATION THIRTEEN INTERESTING LINE STAFF ACTIVITIES. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO BETTER DETECT ISSUES BEFORE THEY SPREAD USED DATA INDICATES REVIEWS MORE PROACTIVELY DRIVE ACTION TO DRIVE PROGRESSIVE AND EQUITABLE CHILD WELFARE POLICY. IN A DIFFERENT IMPROVING CHILDREN'S LIVES THE CRUX OF THE FOUR O'CLOCK TO DECREASE THE CANCELLATION BILITY FOR CALIFORNIA RELATED TO THE NEED FOR SUCH OVERSIGHT. FINALLY WOULD BE POSITIONED WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFFING TO IMPLEMENT DATA INFORMED OVERSIGHT EVERYTHING INVESTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE REPORT THAT MADE AVAILABLE IN RECENT YEARS. THAT IS DIRECTLY TARGETING THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM NEEDS ADDRESSING IDENTIFIED CAPACITY AND PRACTICE STAFF. WITH THE COST OF THE PROPOSAL WILL ULTIMATELY BE IN DECREASING THE FREQUENCY OF UNDESIRABLE EXPERIENCES FOR CHILDREN IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND SHORT TERM OUTCOMES MAY APPEAR COUNTER INTUITIVE AND NOT MORE EFFORT. MAYBE DISCOVERED AND INVESTIGATED THROUGH. THE SMALL CRAFT APPROACH. LOCAL SUPPORT FOR TERM GOAL OF. AND A- CRITICAL. IT'S REQUESTED RATE ARE NOT OF. RIGHT OUT FROM WITH STATE AND FEDERAL MAN OR VERY GREAT FOR YOUR CONSIDER. HAPPY THERE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FOR. THAT'S THE GREATEST OF FINANCE- ONLY TO MAKE IS REALLY TO THE QUESTION IN THE I. COMMITTEE AGENDA THE SUN CAN'T COMMIT TO SOMETHING THAT- RECOMMENDATION ABOUT HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FOR A RALLY- THANK YOU ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD AND JUST COMMENT ON ON THE SAME ISSUE THAT- THAT FINANCES COMMENTED ON. WE AGREE WITH A STAFF RECOMMENDATION COMMENT THAT IT IT COULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO- CONSIDER BUDGET LANGUAGE AROUND SOME SORT OF REGULAR- REPORTING REQUEST- TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER OVERSEE PROGRESS MADE- TOWARD REDUCING SHELTERS SHELTER STAYS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND WEBER STATE'S NEXT YEAR T. P.'S- BUT YOU KNOW AT AS FINANCE NOTED WE WERE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE OUT A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE UNDER AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO. SO WHAT ABOUT TWO SEPARATE ISSUES RIGHT CHILDREN UNDER SIX AND THEN OVERSTAYS SOMEONE OVERSTAYS ARE NOT JUST CHILDREN OVER SIX UNDER SIX BUT CHILDREN OVER SIX AS WELL AS I CORRECT. ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN. MIGHT BE A BETTER AS MEMBERS OF THE U. FROM THE F. CARE TNCS ARE TEENAGERS CORRECT. OKAY SO. SO THAT'S GONNA BE TWO STOP PRESS TWO TO PERMANENT STAFF POSITIONS. AND THERE ARE THEY ARE THEY GONNA BE OVERSEEING THIS. THANK NOT ONE DOING. THE OVERSTAYS AND ONE DOING UNDER SIX OR THEY BOTH GOING TO BE DOING BOTH THINGS. IT'LL BE DOING BETTER WE'RE AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN BE DOING MORE PROACTIVE KEITH PREVIEWS AND LOOKING AT THE DATA MORE PROACTIVELY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY TRENDS THAT WE KNOW CAN LEAD TO SOME OF THE EVERITT STATE- BUT THEN THE SHELTER ANYTHING ON IN THE ATMOSPHERE KIKI- AND THEN- FINDING. WAYS TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY TRIED ON APPLY THOSE TRENDS- AND ADDRESS THEM. AGAIN IN A MORE PROACTIVE WAY BUT I WOULD IMAGINE BOTH. BOTH INDIVIDUALS WILL BE WORKING WITH US POPULATIONS OKAY. AND YOU WANT TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENTS FOR OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS. OF. OF WATCHING THIS ONGOING. THE BOOK FINANCING. COULD.

OKAY THE I DON'T HAVE ANY. IS WITH THIS THAT ITEM I THINK MY LARGER ISSUE IS I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. CAN CAN SUPPORT ALL ALL OF THE KIDS IN OUR SYSTEM SO I. ALWAYS JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ARE THEY NOT BEING PLACED OR THE STING TOO LONG BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT OTHER OPTIONS FOR THEM. AND IF SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CREATE THOSE OPTIONS AND NOT JUST TRYING TO REDUCE TIME. BUT PROVIDE THE BEST OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES THAT WE CAN AND I KNOW WE ALL AGREE ON THOSE SAME THINGS. AND I THINK SOMETIMES ARE LEGISLATION GOES INTO. EFFECT BEFORE WE HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY IN THE FIELD. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH. TO BE ABLE TO DIVERT BOTH DEVELOPED THE PLACEMENT THAT WE NEED AND TO MAINTAIN THOSE PLACEMENTS. TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THESE TWO STAFF MEMBERS. WELL IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE THIRD IS DOING THAT THE ACTIVE WORK AROUND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT I THINK PART OF. THAT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY ENGAGING A CHILD AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP. AND THOSE PLACEMENT IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR CHILDREN BEING PASSED WITH THEIR OWN FAMILIES WHERE THEY EXPERIENCED THE GREATEST ABILITY- IS WHEN WE IDENTIFY A CHILD AND FAMILY PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN TO EXPECT THATARE ENDING UP IN SHELTERS REALLY WANTING TO IMPROVE.

COUNCILS SAPRISSA INSTEAD OF TO HELP YOU SEE WORK AS- WILL NOT TRANSFER SEE THE APPS AND- THE LOCAL THE PER. THAT TRANSFER SKILL IN DATA FOR SERVICE. ALSO A QUESTION IN REGARD TO THE ELECTRON PAIN SYSTEM BY S. AND SAID ONLY TIME PAYMENTS SYSTEM WOULD BE IN PASCAL THIS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY FISCALE SCO AND PAST TEO CURRENTLY THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS OR TIMELINES FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION- IN ADDITION THE APPS. ESIO HAS A HYBRID E. F. T. PROCESS THIS PROCESS REQUIRES SCO TO APPROVE THE SCHOOL FIRST THEN AUDITED APPROVED THE PROCEDURES AND HAVE THE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY GROUPS DEVELOP A FLAT FILE FOR EXAMPLE THAT CASSIDY ABSOLUTELY TO THE SCO THE MAIN. MAINFRAME FOR AUDITS THE PROJECT COST FOR THIS EACH OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS IS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE K. AND COST OF ONGOING AUDITS. EACH IMPLEMENTATION COULD TAKE- I'M ABOUT NINE MONTHS OR SO THE MINIMUM TO GET THIS GOING. A MINUTE AND TURN IT OVER TO BRIAN TO LET THAT BE DIRECTOR OF THE RESEARCH AND AUTOMATIC AND DATA DIVISION TO FIGHT. TO THE NEXT COUPLE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LOU BAY ARE LET OF FROM THE RESEARCH ARMY AND DATA DEBATE- SO I'M GOING TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS FOR- ABOUT. THE NEED FOR THE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT IN THE TIMELINE FOR THE EXISTING CITY SYSTEMS- AND- SO THE COW STARK SOLUTION- HAS THREE COMPONENTS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED CONCURRENTLY BUT MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIMELINES THE FIRST CONSISTENT COMPONENT IS A CONSUMER EDUCATION TOOL THAT WILL LAUNCH. AN INITIAL VERSION THIS SUMMER. THE SECOND COMPONENT IS THE ENTERPRISE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL GOVERN HOW DATA FLOWS WITHIN THE CHILD CARE LANDSCAPE IN BETWEEN OTHER PROGRAM AREAS. WE HAVE ENOUGH IN INITIAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS FUNCTIONALITY. HELLO THE OTHER COMPONENTS. THE THIRD COMPONENT OUT OF FROM OF TELLS WILL FOCUS ON THE DATA COLLECTION ADMINISTRATIVE BUSINESS PROCESS SEEKS TO REPLACE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EXISTING CITY LEGACY SYSTEMS. YES IS CURRENTLY IN STAGE TO THE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS PHASE OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOLUTION. YES THAT'S THE CONTRACTED WITH ACCENTURE TO HELP WITH BUSINESS DISCOVERY AND PRODUCE THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION TO CAPTURE THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS WHILE WE ARE STILL FINALIZING THE WORK PLAN BUT THE CENTER. WE EXPECT THAT THIS PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETED SOMETIME IN Q. THREE OF STATE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND SUBMIT AS TO A- TO SEE AT FORK WILL THAT TIME. AT THAT POINT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE REMAINING TIME LINE BUT THE NEXT STEPS WILL BE COMPLETION OF THE PRODUCT OF A LIFE CYCLE AND RUNNING- PROCUREMENT TO IDENTIFY A SOLUTION- MEETING CSS IS T. ISN'T TECHNICAL NEEDS. AND THEN EXECUTING ON THAT PARTICULAR TRIP BY THE SOLUTION AND BRING A BETTER ON BOARD FOR THE DESIGN CONFIGURATION AND IMPLEMENTATION. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY CDT AND- JAZZ TOGETHER TECHNICAL EXPERT. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPEDITE. THIS PRODUCT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT I'M SO WE ARE WE CAN WORKING HARD TO MEET THE ESTABLISHED OUTLINES THE EXISTING CITY SYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX THE BILL THIS AFTER IS TO STAND UP A NEW SYSTEM LEVERAGING OFF THE SHELF SOLUTIONS WHEN POSSIBLE WHICH ALLOWS TO UNIFY THE ARCHITECTURE BUT ALSO RE ENGINEERING- EFFICIENT BUSINESS PROCESSES. AS A RESULT WE HAVE PLACED MORE EMPHASIS ON UP FRONT PLANNING WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL SAVE TIME ON THE BACK AND- WITH REGARDS TO- CONTINUING TO ACCESS THESE SYSTEMS. THE TIMELINE FOR THAT WILL DEPEND ON CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS HOW QUICKLY WE ARE ABLE TO GET USERS TO ADAPT AND PRACTICES. WE PLAN TO EXPLORE PHASE APPROACHES FOR ROLLOUT WHICH COULD MEAN THAT WE ATTAIN INDEPENDENCE PARTS OF THE CITY SYSTEMS ON DIFFERENT TIMELINES. WE WILL ENGAGE WITH CD AS WE ASSESS WHAT IS MOST AFFECTED ARE TO ASSESS WHAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT- OF THE SYSTEMS TO TRANSITION FIRST. FINALLY I WOULD NOTE- THAT IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SEED INTENSELY CONTINUE TO USE THESE SYSTEMS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THEY RUN IT WAS NOT TRANSFERRED OVER TO CSS. AS PART OF HELP. WE WILL COME. THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM TO THE STATUS QUO- MAINLY CONTINUING TO USE THE CD SYSTEMS- TO THE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH THAT COMPARISON IS THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE PROVIDING FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE EXISTING LEGACY SYSTEMS WHICH COULD MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON. THERE IS ONE FINAL QUESTION REGARDING THE ONGOING COSTS AND THE CAL SPARK SOLUTION- AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE. WONDERING COSTS WILL DEPEND ON THE SOLUTION THAT IS ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED. WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TONIGHT ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS SOON AS THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT ONCE WE COMPLETE OUR- ESTIMATE BASED ON THE PRODUCT.
