00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.734 region:rollup2
IT EASIER FOR CRIMINALS TO

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:56.235 region:rollup2
COMMIT THESE OFFENSES.

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.703 region:rollup2
AND THE THREAT CANNOT BE

00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:59.838 region:rollup2
OVERSTATED.

00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:00.439 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KEEP PACE.

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.440 region:rollup2
I'D ACTUALLY SAY WE NEED TO

00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:03.475 region:rollup2
OUTPACE

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.177 region:rollup2
TODAY'S MARTIN CRIMINALS.

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:06.878 region:rollup2
THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A

00:29:05.177 --> 00:29:07.779 region:rollup2
SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:09.414 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT TO HELP CALIFORNIA

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:10.582 region:rollup2
PUT UP THE FIGHT.

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:12.751 region:rollup2
AND PUT MORE CYBER CRIMINALS

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:14.419 region:rollup2
BEHIND BARS.

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.421 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION OUR CALIFORNIA

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:17.723 region:rollup2
JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.024 region:rollup2
DIVISION WHAT WE CALL SEE JUST

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:20.892 region:rollup2
IS WORKING TO PREVENT CYBER

00:29:19.024 --> 00:29:22.427 region:rollup2
ATTACKS AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.894 region:rollup2
OF JUSTICE ITSELF.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.096 region:rollup2
AND AGAINST LOCAL LAW

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:25.664 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:27.199 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:28.533 region:rollup2
WE NEED THREE POINT ONE MILLION

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:30.469 region:rollup2
DOLLARS INVESTMENT TO PROTECT

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:31.570 region:rollup2
THE SECURITY OF TENS OF MILLIONS

00:29:30.469 --> 00:29:33.672 region:rollup2
OF SENSITIVE RECORDS AROUND THE

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.873 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:36.475 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:38.543 region:rollup2
REQUIRE A CONTINUED FOCUS AND

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:40.012 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION. ESPECIALLY AS OUR

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:41.947 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FACES A NUMBER OF

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:43.382 region:rollup2
UNFUNDED MANDATES.

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:45.350 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WE HAVE A MAJOR

00:29:43.382 --> 00:29:46.952 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IMPLEMENT AB

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.820 region:rollup2
THREE EIGHTY FOUR. SIGNED INTO

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:50.455 region:rollup2
LAW LAST YEAR. WHICH ESTABLISH A

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
TIER BASED SEX OFFENDER

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:54.493 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION SYSTEM.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:56.128 region:rollup2
WE ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE. LAST

00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:57.829 region:rollup2
YEAR AS THIS BILL WAS GOING TO

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:59.531 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS THAT IT WOULD COST.

00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:02.501 region:rollup2
TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:04.403 region:rollup2
THIS NEW SYSTEM NEXT YEAR ALONE.

00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:06.571 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH HIGHER COSTS OVER THE

00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:07.973 region:rollup2
NEXT THREE YEARS.

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:10.008 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE IN THIS CASE

00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:11.743 region:rollup2
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION WHEN IT

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:13.211 region:rollup2
COMES TO DETERMINING WHEN AND

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.379 region:rollup2
WHETHER SOMEONE CONVICTED OF A

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:16.381 region:rollup2
SEX OFFENSE

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:18.517 region:rollup2
MUST REMAIN ON A LIST OF

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:20.085 region:rollup2
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS.

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:21.720 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:22.487 region:rollup2
BUILT FOR THE HUGE VOLUME OF

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.289 region:rollup2
DATA NECESSARY TO MAKE HEARING

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:25.323 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:27.292 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:28.393 region:rollup2
FUNDING WE IDENTIFIED IN ORDER

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.728 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:31.897 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:32.998 region:rollup2
I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT WE

00:30:31.897 --> 00:30:34.800 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THIS

00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:36.368 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION'S REQUIREMENT TO PUT

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.136 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE STATE'S NEARLY ONE

00:30:36.368 --> 00:30:39.905 region:rollup2

TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:48.246 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE FACE ANOTHER ONE

00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:48.880 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED MANDATE

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:49.748 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THREE BILLS FOR

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.849 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:53.151 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:54.720 region:rollup2
RECEIVED NO FUNDING.

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:56.288 region:rollup2
WE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL POSITION

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.790 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:30:56.288 --> 00:31:00.392 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT AB ELEVEN FIFTEEN.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.027 region:rollup2
A BILL RELATED TO CONVICTIONS

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:03.295 region:rollup2
AND EXPUNGEMENT.

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:04.596 region:rollup2
WE NEED THOSE FUNDS TO ENSURE

00:31:03.295 --> 00:31:06.198 region:rollup2
THAT INCREASES IN REQUEST FOR

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:08.266 region:rollup2
DISMISSALS.

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.900 region:rollup2

FOR FUNDING AND POSITION.

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:17.409 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO ALERT YOU TO THE

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:18.944 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THE STATE WILL FACE IN

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:21.179 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING A. B. ELEVEN FIFTY

ACT.

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:31.990 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:33.725 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT THREE HUNDRED

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.226 region:rollup2
FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.026 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.862 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:38.730 region:rollup2

ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT THE RESOURCES

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:45.504 region:rollup2
I CANNOT REPORT TO YOU THAT THE

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:46.405 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS THE

00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:47.873 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO MEET THESE NEW

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:50.442 region:rollup2
DEMANDS. GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:51.643 region:rollup2

00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:53.278 region:rollup2

A BILL RELATED TO SEALING

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:02.521 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL RECORDS.

00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:03.355 region:rollup2
WE NEED THOSE FUNDS TO ENSURE

00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:04.956 region:rollup2
THAT CRIMINAL HISTORY

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:07.025 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS PROPERLY

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:09.194 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED AND UPDATED.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:10.562 region:rollup2
BUT WE WERE DENIED. ITS HARD TO

00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:12.063 region:rollup2
SEE HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THIS NEW

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:13.799 region:rollup2
WORK WITHOUT THE PERSONNEL AND

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:15.133 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND WE'RE

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:16.635 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE DOING THIS WITH

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:18.036 region:rollup2
MISTAKES.

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:19.704 region:rollup2
IT'S TOO IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:20.338 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INVOLVED AND IT'S TOO

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.439 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO DO IT

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:22.874 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:24.342 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WE

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:26.745 region:rollup2
ARE DOING MUCH OF THIS WORK.

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:29.281 region:rollup2
WITHOUT COMPETITIVE SALARIES.

00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:30.682 region:rollup2
TWO QUICK EXAMPLES.

00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:32.584 region:rollup2
OUR OUR SUPPORT STAFF AND OUR

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:34.286 region:rollup2
PARALEGALS.

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:35.720 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:37.923 region:rollup2
LESS THAN WHAT IS PAID IN THE

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.658 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:32:37.923 --> 00:32:40.692 region:rollup2
I'D LET ME REPEAT THAT THEY

00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:42.861 region:rollup2
DON'T MAKE SICK LITTLE MAKE

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:44.095 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOU MAKE

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:46.465 region:rollup2
ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY MAKE

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:47.466 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF LESS.

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.167 region:rollup2

BALANCE.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.576 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS WHO DO THE THE CHECK

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.810 region:rollup2
ON EVIDENCE FORENSICS AND OTHER

00:32:57.576 --> 00:33:00.345 region:rollup2

ARE THERE PAID APPROXIMATELY

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.481 region:rollup2
NINETEEN PERCENT BELOW OTHER

STATE AND A LOCAL POLICE

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:06.818 region:rollup2
OFFICER.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:09.454 region:rollup2
IT IS TOUGH TO COMPETE.

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:10.322 region:rollup2
TO GET THE BEST.

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:12.357 region:rollup2

MAYBE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:27.659 region:rollup2

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.327 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY.

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:30.195 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY IF WE

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.097 region:rollup2
COULD BE AS COST NEUTRAL AS

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:33.865 region:rollup2

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.051 region:rollup2
A STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT ARM THAT

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:55.687 region:rollup2
WILL HANDLE CANNABIS.

00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:56.588 region:rollup2
THEIR IS NO WAY THAT THE LOCAL

00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:58.423 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL BE

00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:59.924 region:rollup2
A TO HANDLE THIS BY THEMSELVES

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:02.494 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE COORDINATION.

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:03.461 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY THINK THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:05.196 region:rollup2
OF JUSTICE'S DIVISION OF LAW

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:05.397 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT.

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.731 region:rollup2
COULD.

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:06.931 region:rollup2
HANDLE THIS.

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:09.834 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:11.336 region:rollup2

BUT AS YOU MENTION WE DID VERY

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:16.708 region:rollup2
WELL WHEN WE DID HAVE.

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:18.209 region:rollup2

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:23.748 region:rollup2
MOVED QUICKLY.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.550 region:rollup2

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:28.253 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT

BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE US A US.

00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:31.790 region:rollup2
A SMALL WINDOW BEFORE.

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:33.525 region:rollup2
THIS BEGINS TO OVERWHELM.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.960 region:rollup2
STATE AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.228 region:rollup2

THEUNFUNDED MANDATES THINGS

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:36.241 region:rollup2

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:37.742 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESEARCH ON

00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:38.943 region:rollup2
I WANTED ON THE RECORD NOW. SO

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:41.679 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTION IF I COME

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:42.146 region:rollup2

MAKE SURE WE MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:52.056 region:rollup2
OKAY AS FAR AS.

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:53.491 region:rollup2
FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS. THAT LET

.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:57.228 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:00.164 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT IS

00:39:57.228 --> 00:40:00.798 region:rollup2
.

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.133 region:rollup2
FILLED TO THE BRIM WHEN IT COMES

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:04.769 region:rollup2
TO WORK.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:05.536 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OF

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:07.071 region:rollup2
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY DISTRICT

THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO.

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:13.578 region:rollup2
.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:15.613 region:rollup2
BUT I DO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:17.181 region:rollup2
MAKING PROGRESS.

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:18.483 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:19.918 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TRUST WITH WITH THEIR

OUT CHIEF OF POLICE DE HAAN

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:29.327 region:rollup2
REACH OUT TO ME AND I THOUGHT IT

00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:31.329 region:rollup2
WAS IMPORTANT.

00:40:29.327 --> 00:40:32.897 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH AT THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:34.332 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:35.633 region:rollup2
AND TRAIN PROVIDED INDEPENDENT

00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:36.467 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT SOME INDEPENDENT EYES

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:38.436 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:39.170 region:rollup2
THOUGH INVESTIGATION.

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.039 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.473 region:rollup2
CHIEF AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:43.641 region:rollup2
CITY LEADERS WERE WILLING TO

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT WE WOULD TAKE A

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:48.746 region:rollup2
BROADER VIEW.

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:51.182 region:rollup2
OF THE POLICING PRACTICES

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:53.051 region:rollup2
A REVIEW OF THE PROTOCOLS THE

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:55.153 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES THE POLICIES THE

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:56.454 region:rollup2
TRAINING WHICH I THINK

00:40:55.153 --> 00:40:57.789 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY GETS YOU TO THE ROOT

00:40:56.454 --> 00:41:00.491 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF THESE TYPES OF THE.

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:03.895 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:05.229 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THE QUESTION.

00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:07.231 region:rollup2
DO I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT A

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:09.067 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT. AND SAID THINK WITH

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:10.802 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO CANNABIS THE.

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:12.770 region:rollup2
A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:13.838 region:rollup2
THE STATE LOOKED AT IS THE THE

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2
GOOSE THOSE LAYING GOLDEN EGGS

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:16.407 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT.

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:16.941 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THAT

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.177 region:rollup2
IS ALSO DRIVING THE BLACK

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:21.913 region:rollup2
MARKET.

00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:23.614 region:rollup2
AND FOR WHATEVER RESOURCES THAT

00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:24.215 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IT'S LEGITIMATE FOR

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.149 region:rollup2
YOU TO BE ASKING FOR RESOURCES

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.150 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.185 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.120 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CHARGING THAT

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:30.221 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.756 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE LEGITIMATE

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:33.391 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THRIVES.

00:41:31.756 --> 00:41:34.826 region:rollup2
AND DOES WELL BECAUSE IT'S HERE

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:35.660 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOING TO BE HERE AND

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:37.395 region:rollup2
THEN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.396 region:rollup2
TO.

00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:39.831 region:rollup2
THIS INCENTIVIZE THE BLACK

00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:42.367 region:rollup2
MARKET.

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:43.401 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE.

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:44.001 region:rollup2
REALLY THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES

00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.336 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.838 region:rollup2
THE.

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:48.673 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO ON THE LINE IN AND I

00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:50.808 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHY. YOU'RE WISE TO

00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:51.476 region:rollup2
BE HERE AND AND ENGAGE WITH US

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:53.978 region:rollup2
AND BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT.

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:55.380 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:57.949 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT DAY YOU ARE

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.217 region:rollup2
FACING AND THERE'S A IN THAT

00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:00.518 region:rollup2
VEIN THERE'S A BILL THAT'S

00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:02.787 region:rollup2
COMING THROUGH MY COMMITTEE.

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.554 region:rollup2
ON A NEW BUREAU OR A NOTION OF A

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:05.156 region:rollup2
NEW BUREAU FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:06.357 region:rollup2
JUSTICE

00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:06.958 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN WORKING

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:09.560 region:rollup2
THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:12.597 region:rollup2
QUITE.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.531 region:rollup2
ABED AND LATELY REALLY STARTING

00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:14.665 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIRONMENTAL

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.267 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:17.568 region:rollup2
IS A LANGUAGE AND A PERSPECTIVE

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.236 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS VERY WELL

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:20.538 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD HERE BUT IT'S REALLY

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:22.306 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA FOR

00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:24.308 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.576 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT BILL IS MOVING

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:27.545 region:rollup2
THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE BUT

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:28.112 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY A BUDGET QUESTION.

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.380 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LETTER

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:31.582 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.518 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUE MR GARCIA HAS HAS

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:34.786 region:rollup2
PUT A LETTER FOR HOW DO YOU HOW

00:42:33.518 --> 00:42:37.155 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU SEE THAT ASSUMING THAT

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:38.790 region:rollup2
WE FUNDED AND I'M CERTAINLY VERY

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:41.025 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE. OF.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.527 region:rollup2
THAT THAT EFFORT ENSURING THAT

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:44.862 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:46.464 region:rollup2
CAN TO ENSURE DID. MAKE SURE

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:50.068 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:42:46.464 --> 00:42:51.736 region:rollup2
THE WORST IMPACTED BY SOME THE

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:53.337 region:rollup2
BARBELL DEGRADATION

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:55.239 region:rollup2
OR BEING WERE.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
TREATED RESPECTFULLY AND AND

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:59.277 region:rollup2
TREATED APPROPRIATELY AS WE TRY

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:59.877 region:rollup2
AND FORCE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:00.445 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF HOW I WOULD SEE

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.279 region:rollup2
HOW HOW WOULD YOU SEE THAT

00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:02.313 region:rollup2
COMING TOGETHER.

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:04.215 region:rollup2
I I THINK FOR THE LONGEST TIME

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:05.016 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT.

00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:06.050 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF PROTECTING ARM

00:43:05.016 --> 00:43:08.686 region:rollup2
FIREMAN.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.822 region:rollup2
AND HANDLING.

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:13.524 region:rollup2
OUR ACTIONS

00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:15.827 region:rollup2
IN DEFENSE OF CLEAN AIR CLEAN

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:18.062 region:rollup2
WATER. A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AS

00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:19.730 region:rollup2
A GLOBAL ISSUE.

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:21.799 region:rollup2
AND I OFTENTIMES WHAT WE

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:25.002 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE IS

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:25.837 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:27.872 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIT.

00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:29.807 region:rollup2
FIRST.

00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:31.909 region:rollup2
AND HARDEST.

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:34.111 region:rollup2
AND ARE LEAST EQUIPPED.

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:35.079 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE ILLS THAT COME

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.381 region:rollup2
FROM DEGRADATION OF OUR

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:39.150 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.818 region:rollup2
AND UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING FOR

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.386 region:rollup2
THESE COMMITTEES EARLY.

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:45.022 region:rollup2
WE MISSED THE BOAT.

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:45.656 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:48.693 region:rollup2
THESE ARE COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:50.795 region:rollup2
LIVING WITH. LEAD TAINTED HOMES

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:52.063 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
AND FOR THEM THE NEED IS

00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:54.232 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE THESE ARE HOMES THAT

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.833 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:43:54.232 --> 00:43:57.268 region:rollup2
.

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:59.670 region:rollup2
BEEN IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE

00:43:57.268 --> 00:44:00.671 region:rollup2
RIGHT NEXT TO ALL THE WHERE ALL

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.440 region:rollup2
THE FREEWAYS HAVE BEEN BUILT.

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.241 region:rollup2
AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.008 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FROM A.

00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.110 region:rollup2
TAILPIPES

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:08.613 region:rollup2
FOR DECADES AND SO FOR THEM IT

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.547 region:rollup2
IT'S REAL TO HAVE. A REDUCTION

00:44:08.613 --> 00:44:11.883 region:rollup2
IN THEM AND IN A MATTER OF.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:12.416 region:rollup2
.

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:15.319 region:rollup2
POLLUTING EMISSIONS FROM

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:16.254 region:rollup2
VEHICLES BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:18.122 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE LAST TO COULD BE

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:19.790 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED IN THE SOLUTIONS THAT

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:21.792 region:rollup2
WE COME UP WITH BECAUSE OUR

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.362 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS ARE VERY GLOBAL. WHERE

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:25.696 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES NEED A

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
DISTANCE IMMEDIATELY THAT'S WHY

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:29.734 region:rollup2
AS AS ACCOMPLISH AS? OUR

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:30.368 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION HAS BEEN

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:32.036 region:rollup2
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:32.537 region:rollup2
LEGAL SECTION.

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.272 region:rollup2
AT IN DEALING WITH THE

00:44:32.537 --> 00:44:35.873 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:44:34.272 --> 00:44:36.574 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE A BUREAU

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:38.276 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DEDICATED TO

00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:40.111 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:42.413 region:rollup2
SO THAT THESE COMMUNITIES HAD

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:44.849 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ON THEIR SITE EARLY.

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:47.885 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT THEIR PLIGHT NOW

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:49.921 region:rollup2
VERSES IN THAT GLOBAL.

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:51.355 region:rollup2
SOLUTION THAT WE COME UP WITH.

00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:52.557 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:54.025 region:rollup2
FIND IS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAYLOR

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:56.460 region:rollup2
ARE SOLUTIONS A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.928 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY WHEN WE TAKE INTO

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.696 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THAT THESE ARE

.

00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:49.814 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ALMOST IT'S ALMOST A

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.749 region:rollup2
VICIOUS CYCLE.

00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:54.919 region:rollup2
THE SLOWER WE ACTED TO TRY TO

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:56.120 region:rollup2
ATTACK THE.

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.089 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND PART OF THIS ECONOMY

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.191 region:rollup2
ON CANNABIS.

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:02.326 region:rollup2
THE LESS RESOURCE WE COLLECT.

00:46:00.191 --> 00:46:03.894 region:rollup2
IN LICENSE SEEN AND TAXATION SO

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:05.229 region:rollup2
FORTH THE LESS RESEARCH WE HAVE

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.198 region:rollup2
THE LESS MONEY WE HAVE TO SEND

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:08.499 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:46:07.198 --> 00:46:09.367 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LESS MONEY

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:11.302 region:rollup2
THEY GET THE LESS ENFORCEMENT

00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:12.536 region:rollup2
THEY CAN DO THE LESS ENFORCEMENT

00:46:11.302 --> 00:46:13.571 region:rollup2
THEY DO THE MORE THE GUYS ARE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.139 region:rollup2
DOING LEGITIMATELY SAY WAIT A

00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:16.440 region:rollup2
MINUTE I'M BE UNDERCUT.

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:18.109 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY BY THE GUYS ARE

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.076 region:rollup2
DOING IT THE WRONG WAY. AND IT

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:21.612 region:rollup2
BECOMES A VICIOUS CYCLE WHERE

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:23.414 region:rollup2
ALMOST BECOMES BETTER TO DO IT

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.981 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND.

00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:24.582 region:rollup2
THEY DO IT ABOVE THE TAPE.

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.816 region:rollup2
AND.

00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:27.918 region:rollup2
I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:29.120 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE.

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.354 region:rollup2
PUTTING MONEY IN THE HANDS OF

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.323 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO MAKE SURE

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:33.891 region:rollup2
IT'S DONE RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT

00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:35.393 region:rollup2
STARTS TO BE DONE WRONG. IT'S

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:37.161 region:rollup2
GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ON

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:39.730 region:rollup2
WINE THAT AND WE WILL RUE THE

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:41.298 region:rollup2
DAY WHEN WE FOR GOT TO PROVIDE

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:44.302 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS NEW

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:46.137 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY. ESTABLISHES FOOTING.

00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.338 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I WOULD

00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:48.739 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WE WOULD TAKE INTO

00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:50.074 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THAT YOU GOT A WHOLE

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:51.342 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF POLICE CHIEFS AND

00:46:50.074 --> 00:46:53.311 region:rollup2
SHERIFFS.

00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:54.879 region:rollup2
AND STATE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:57.581 region:rollup2

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:59.917 region:rollup2
OFFICERS LIKE ME ARE ARE HAVING

00:46:57.581 --> 00:47:02.386 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT NOW.

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:04.221 region:rollup2
WITH NO NEW RESOURCES SO FAR TO

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:05.990 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:08.392 region:rollup2
CALLED THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.760 region:rollup2
AND WE BETTER GET A GRIP FAST

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:12.096 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I COULD EASILY SEE THE

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:12.096 --> 00:47:14.699 region:rollup2
SWING OF THE PENDULUM IN

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.133 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS IT THIS IS

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:17.501 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED.

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:19.537 region:rollup2
THIS TO LOOK LIKE BUT TRY TO ON

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:20.638 region:rollup2
WINE THAT.

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:21.472 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:23.774 region:rollup2

00:47:21.472 --> 00:47:25.676 region:rollup2

PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:31.248 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE RIGHT THING TO

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.551 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE RIGHT WAY.

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.919 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT.

00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:35.986 region:rollup2
AND I IN I DO AGREE WITHOUT THAT

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:36.887 region:rollup2
I THINK SOME OF THE INITIAL

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.322 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE WITH

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.157 region:rollup2

COMMUNITIES WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:00.945 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND WE HAVE NOT LINK

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
THOSE EMISSIONS TO THE CRITERIA

00:48:00.945 --> 00:48:05.449 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS WHICH IS WHY. WE HAVE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:07.017 region:rollup2

YOU'RE MORE PEOPLE WHO ON THIS

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:06.130 region:rollup2
LIST WHO NO LONGER. HAVE THE

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.431 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO POSSESS FIREARMS.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.966 region:rollup2
A IF.

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.833 region:rollup2
WE HAD DONE NOTHING.

00:51:08.966 --> 00:51:14.238 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE.

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
SOME.

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:18.876 region:rollup2
STEVE KIRBY FROM RON BUT IT'S

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:22.012 region:rollup2
FORTY SOME ODD THOUSAND OR SO.

00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:23.147 region:rollup2
HERE WE GO THINK WE GOT A NICE

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:23.814 region:rollup2
HANDY CHART HERE.

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:25.049 region:rollup2
THE BLUE LINE SHOWS YOU WHERE WE

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:26.383 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:51:25.049 --> 00:51:27.952 region:rollup2
FOR WE WERE ABLE TO START

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:29.853 region:rollup2
COLLECTING WEAPONS

00:51:27.952 --> 00:51:31.488 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU CAN SEE. WE WOULD BE

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.957 region:rollup2
OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:35.426 region:rollup2
WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE OUT THERE

00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:36.560 region:rollup2
IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T

00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:37.461 region:rollup2
HAVE GOOD WRITING THAT CHART

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.796 region:rollup2
OKAY SO WE'RE DOWN TO TEN

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.997 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:42.433 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THAT THAT

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:43.601 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE GOT BUT.

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:45.235 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:46.937 region:rollup2
WEAPONS A COMMAND AND NOW THAT

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:49.073 region:rollup2
THE THOSE WEAPONS THAT ARE STILL

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:51.909 region:rollup2
OUT ARE PROBABLY HOPE BY PEOPLE

00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:53.544 region:rollup2
WHO ARE. MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:54.511 region:rollup2
GET THEM FROM.

00:51:53.544 --> 00:51:56.013 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE TEAMS THAT HAVE

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:57.848 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T GO OUT BY YOURSELF

00:51:56.013 --> 00:51:59.350 region:rollup2
TO GO COLLECT IT'S A TEAM.

00:51:57.848 --> 00:52:01.018 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.453 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH TEAMS TO GO OUT

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:04.254 region:rollup2
THERE TO TRY TO COLLECT WEAPONS.

00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:05.189 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE IT A REQUEST FOR

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:06.490 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

00:52:05.189 --> 00:52:09.126 region:rollup2
GO OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.928 region:rollup2
VERY SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. NOT

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:12.863 region:rollup2
ONE INCIDENT AND YOU'RE TALKING

00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:13.964 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOLKS MANY OF THEM FELONS

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:15.699 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:17.835 region:rollup2
POSSESS THESE WEAPONS BUT NOT

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:19.103 region:rollup2
ONE INCIDENT WHERE ANYONE.

00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:19.770 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY NOT ARE SPECIAL AGENTS

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:21.238 region:rollup2
OR OTHERS HAVE BEEN HARMED THIS

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.740 region:rollup2
IS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.907 region:rollup2
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT. THE WITH

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.743 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT THE

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:27.077 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE GAVE US WE'VE WE

00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:28.746 region:rollup2
HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:30.481 region:rollup2
BRING DOWN THE NUMBERS BUT TO

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:31.749 region:rollup2
GET ITDOWN TO ESSENTIALLY

00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:35.686 region:rollup2
OPERATIONALLY ZERO WHERE YOU

00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:36.320 region:rollup2
STILL. HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW OF

00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:36.587 region:rollup2
IT WE WILL NEED SOME ADDITIONAL

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.988 region:rollup2
RESOURCES

00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:39.390 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S HERE'S MY QUESTION TO

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:41.759 region:rollup2
YOU BECAUSE AGAIN THIS I

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:44.762 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROCEED YOU

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:44.962 region:rollup2
BUT. IT'S YOUR BABY NOW SEVERAL

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:46.463 region:rollup2
IT IS.

00:52:44.962 --> 00:52:47.197 region:rollup2
.

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.999 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE THE CHART HERE THE

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:50.668 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL MONEY FOR THE APPS

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.368 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO IF YOU COMBINE THAT

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:52.669 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:54.371 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION THAT

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:55.472 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED IT

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:57.341 region:rollup2
COMES UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:58.809 region:rollup2
MILLION IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS

00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:59.376 region:rollup2
SINCE.

00:52:58.809 --> 00:53:00.244 region:rollup2
BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TIME

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.811 region:rollup2
PRINT

00:53:00.244 --> 00:53:04.515 region:rollup2
SO AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE

00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:05.082 region:rollup2
TOLD.

00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:06.483 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE EXACT WORDS

00:53:05.082 --> 00:53:07.618 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:09.586 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU NEED IF YOU

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:11.522 region:rollup2
COULD GIVE OUT ANY NUMBER WHAT

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:12.656 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE AND WE WERE TOLD

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.424 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THIS

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:14.591 region:rollup2
IS HOW MUCH WE NEED TO GET THE

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:16.226 region:rollup2
JOB DONE?

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:18.629 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOW TWO THOUSAND

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:22.132 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN AND THE JOB ISN'T DONE

00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:23.167 region:rollup2
SO. FOR ME IT'S. WHEN WE GONNA

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.568 region:rollup2
LAND ON THE RIGHT NUMBER AND

00:53:23.167 --> 00:53:26.303 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE'RE

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.538 region:rollup2
GONNA GET THESE WEAPONS SO THAT

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:29.273 region:rollup2
NO ONE GETS HURT.

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:30.941 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS TWENTY FOUR

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:31.542 region:rollup2
MILLION IT'S TURNED INTO SEVENTY

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.277 region:rollup2
MILLION AND THAT'S STILL NOT

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:34.878 region:rollup2
ENOUGH I KNOW BY THE WAY WE NEED

00:53:33.277 --> 00:53:37.081 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE MILLION MORE FOR

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:38.782 region:rollup2
THIS AND NINE MORE DID. YOU KNOW

00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:41.218 region:rollup2
TO POSITIONS FOR THAT I MEAN.

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:42.820 region:rollup2
YOU YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:43.954 region:rollup2
THE DIET IS SO YOU GET WHERE I'M

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.423 region:rollup2
COMING FROM MY HOPE.

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:47.658 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:49.026 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THIS PROCESS SYLMAR

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:50.661 region:rollup2
LET ME AT ASK.

00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:52.029 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTOR MISTER LINDLEY TO

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:53.564 region:rollup2
TRY TO RESPOND BECAUSE THAT IT'S

00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:55.599 region:rollup2
HARD FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:57.101 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WELL

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
AND THOSE MONIES I KNOW WHAT WE

00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:00.003 region:rollup2
HAVE BEFORE US. AND I KNOW THE

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:02.039 region:rollup2
WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR BUT

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:02.706 region:rollup2
LET ME SEE IF MISTER LINDE

00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
CONTRACT CLARIFY ON THE NUMBERS.

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:06.710 region:rollup2
SO.

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:08.612 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.080 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION THAT

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:11.849 region:rollup2
YOU AND OTHERS HAVE HAD WITH THE

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.716 region:rollup2
GAPS PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE A

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:15.085 region:rollup2
COUPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:16.954 region:rollup2
CONTROL. SO ONE IS THERE HAS

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.988 region:rollup2
BEEN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:20.824 region:rollup2
SINCE OUR APPS

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:23.160 region:rollup2
STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:23.660 region:rollup2
THEN IN WHEN WE RECEIVED A GREAT

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.295 region:rollup2
DEAL OF MONEY IN TWENTY

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.497 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:29.867 region:rollup2
FRANCIS LONGER RETENTION STARTED

00:54:26.497 --> 00:54:32.069 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN.

00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:34.271 region:rollup2
APPS PRIOR TO THAT WAS BASED

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:36.373 region:rollup2
ONLY ON HAND IN INFORMATION.

00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:38.308 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY HANDGUN AND LONG

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:39.710 region:rollup2
GUN COM REGISTRATIONS ARE

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2
PRODUCES ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY SO

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.044 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.447 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:45.282 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE THAT

00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:47.017 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROHIBIT

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:52.022 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ON TOP OF THAT WE'VE HAD

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:53.123 region:rollup2
A LARGE INCREASE IN GUN SALES.

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.792 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STARTED TWENTY AROUND

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:57.494 region:rollup2
TWENTY ELEVEN.

00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:59.730 region:rollup2
SO. WIN APPS WAS FIRST STARTED

00:54:57.494 --> 00:55:00.297 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CONSEILS

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.865 region:rollup2
AROUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:04.301 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND.

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:06.170 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUN CELLS

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:08.572 region:rollup2
ARE PEAKED AT ONE POINT THREE

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.506 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

00:55:08.572 --> 00:55:11.575 region:rollup2
A GUN CELLS PETE AT ONE POINT

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:13.210 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION. AND EVEN THOUGH

00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:14.611 region:rollup2
IT WAS REDUCED IN TWENTY

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.613 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN OR SO IT HUNDRED

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:17.414 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND.

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:19.183 region:rollup2
OUR GUNS HEALTHCARE IN

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:21.485 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:23.754 region:rollup2
A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF GUN

00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:24.254 region:rollup2
CELLS AND POTENTIALLY. FOUR MORE

00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:25.055 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE BECOMING

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:27.124 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED.

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.724 region:rollup2
JUST KEEPING UP THE NUMBERS WE

00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:28.759 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH THE STAFFING THAT WE

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.993 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:31.195 region:rollup2
DOES THE BEST WE CAN DO BUT FROM

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:32.796 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO

00:55:31.195 --> 00:55:33.764 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY FOUR

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:37.434 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHT PEOPLE WERE

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:38.302 region:rollup2
REMOVED FROM THAT LIST.

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:40.170 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A VERY HIGH NUMBER.

00:55:38.302 --> 00:55:41.972 region:rollup2
WOW.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.407 region:rollup2
WE DID HAVE THAT YEAR IN TWENTY

00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:45.108 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WITH IT EIGHT THOUSAND

00:55:43.407 --> 00:55:47.945 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:48.579 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:49.146 region:rollup2
PEOPLE REMOVED FROM THE LECTURE

00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:51.114 region:rollup2
TALKING FOR ONE YEAR TO THE

00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:51.915 region:rollup2
NEXT.

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.250 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO HAVE YOU ARE AS WELL

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:55.052 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.519 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE WERE ADDED TO THAT

00:55:55.052 --> 00:55:56.954 region:rollup2
SYSTEM DURING THE SAME

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.522 region:rollup2
TIMEFRAME.

00:55:56.954 --> 00:55:59.189 region:rollup2
SO WITH THE GRAPH THEREOF

00:55:58.522 --> 00:56:01.158 region:rollup2
SHOWING PEOPLE ARE ON THE LIST

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:03.794 region:rollup2
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW MANY

00:56:01.158 --> 00:56:04.628 region:rollup2
GUNS YOU BEEN ABLE TO

00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:05.329 region:rollup2
CONFISCATED TO BAIT THE WHAT.

00:56:04.628 --> 00:56:07.798 region:rollup2
THE RELEVANCY IS HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:09.032 region:rollup2
YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE AND VISITED

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:10.500 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THOSE WEAPONS

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:12.202 region:rollup2
FOR. I'M NOT LIKE I GET IT IT'S

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.203 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS WORK I'M JUST TRYING

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.172 region:rollup2
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY IS

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.740 region:rollup2
THIS TAKING SO LONG AND WHY IS

00:56:15.172 --> 00:56:18.308 region:rollup2
IT WE NEED MORE MONEY WE NEED

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.576 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY WHEN. WE ASKED

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.978 region:rollup2
REACHED FOR THIS YOU KNOW THIS

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:24.848 region:rollup2
GUY WHAT DO YOU WANT HOW MUCH

00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:26.917 region:rollup2
MONEY DO YOU NEED AND WE GAVE IT

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:28.051 region:rollup2
TO THE DOJ AND.

00:56:26.917 --> 00:56:28.418 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL NOT THERE ASSEMBLY

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.586 region:rollup2
MEMBER I THINK.

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:33.223 region:rollup2
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT.

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:33.223 region:rollup2
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH WE

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.726 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE NOT THE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:37.661 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OPERATING

00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.762 region:rollup2
UNDER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:40.797 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE NOW WE'VE

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:42.099 region:rollup2
ADDED THE LONG GUNS TO THE LIST

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:43.400 region:rollup2
VERSUS JUST THE.

00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:44.701 region:rollup2
THE REGULAR FARMS THAT WERE ON

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.003 region:rollup2
THE LIST REGIONALLY OR WHETHER

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:48.171 region:rollup2
IT'S A FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN THE

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:49.306 region:rollup2
GUN PURCHASES GO UP DRAMATICALLY

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:51.108 region:rollup2
IN THAT TIME.

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:53.277 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:56:51.108 --> 00:56:54.177 region:rollup2
SECURE WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE WHO

00:56:53.277 --> 00:56:56.213 region:rollup2
WERE MORE WILLING TO.

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:58.081 region:rollup2
TURN THEM OVER PERHAPS IN THE

00:56:56.213 --> 00:56:59.016 region:rollup2
EARLIER YEARS AND SO NOW YOU

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:00.217 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WITH AND

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:02.719 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOT MORE EFFORT.

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:04.921 region:rollup2
BUT WHATEVER THE FACTOR IT'S IT

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:07.057 region:rollup2
IT'S TAKING OUR VIA THE TIME

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:08.692 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE. AND THE RESOURCES

00:57:07.057 --> 00:57:09.726 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE THE FUNDING THAT WE

00:57:08.692 --> 00:57:10.961 region:rollup2
GOT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IS ABOUT

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:12.229 region:rollup2
TO EXPIRE THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY

00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:14.231 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:15.732 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A REPRIEVE WE'RE GONNA

00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:16.366 region:rollup2
BE IN EVEN WORSE SHAPE WHEN IT

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:18.602 region:rollup2
COMES TO TRYING TO REMOVE THOSE

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:19.770 region:rollup2
WEAPONS. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:21.338 region:rollup2
CAN SEE IS THAT WE ARE

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.173 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY REMOVING.

00:57:21.338 --> 00:57:24.775 region:rollup2
WEAPONS FROM THOSE WHO LOST THE

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:26.677 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO POSSESS THEM

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:28.512 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM I

00:57:26.677 --> 00:57:30.180 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT IF YOU

00:57:28.512 --> 00:57:31.148 region:rollup2

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.487 region:rollup2
BREAKDOWN OF THE NUMBERS I'D

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.121 region:rollup2
MORE THAN WE DO THAT I THINK

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:40.457 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANYTHING TO HIDE IN THIS

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:43.560 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. IT JUST THE TASK IT'S A

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:44.394 region:rollup2
IT'S A. MONUMENTAL TASK BUT THE

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.696 region:rollup2
ONLY STATE THAT DOES IT.

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.630 region:rollup2

I THINK THE REQUEST A

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:17.060 region:rollup2
REASONABLE IF WE EXPECT THINGS

ALWAYS RE EVALUATE THE REQUESTED

MULTI YEAR PLAN.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:55.078 region:rollup2
IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE THE

THINGS LIKE.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:16.566 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:18.168 region:rollup2
PURSUED AND INVESTIGATED AS WELL

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.302 region:rollup2
AS THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:21.304 region:rollup2
GENERATE.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:22.739 region:rollup2
MONETARY RECOVERIES WE ARE

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.074 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING PROVIDING SOME

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.910 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS THE

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:28.478 region:rollup2
SECTION HAS REPORTED TURNING

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.213 region:rollup2
AWAY OUR BACKLOG IN CASES AS

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:31.348 region:rollup2
WELL AS ITS ATTORNEYS WORKING

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.015 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT OVER TIME.

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:33.683 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:35.919 region:rollup2
IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS TOTAL

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.022 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.457 region:rollup2
TO JUSTIFY ALL OF THE REQUESTED

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:41.958 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.426 region:rollup2
ON YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WILL

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.995 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT NEW CASES BE

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.929 region:rollup2
GENERATED AND THEN GENERATE THE

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:47.430 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT REVENUES BECAUSE

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:49.032 region:rollup2
UNLIKE THE EXISTING POSITIONS

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.566 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE POSITIONS WILL BE

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:51.001 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY THAT TYPE OF

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.969 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:54.237 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO SYMBOLIC IS THAT IT'S

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.839 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR WHETHER THE REQUESTED

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.673 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.541 region:rollup2
GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE

01:02:56.673 --> 01:03:00.276 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DOJ REPORTS THAT

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:02.512 region:rollup2
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:04.881 region:rollup2
ITS INVESTIGATED CASES TURN INTO

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:06.149 region:rollup2
LITIGATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.951 region:rollup2
OF GENERATING SETTLEMENT

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:09.252 region:rollup2
REMINISCENCE UNCLEAR WHETHER

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.887 region:rollup2
THIS PERCENTAGE WILL INCREASE

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:12.389 region:rollup2
AND TO WHAT EXTENT TO GENERATE

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:15.025 region:rollup2
THE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THE NEW

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:15.725 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.327 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
YOU COME TO ANY OF YOU WANT TO

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:19.529 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THAT ON THEY'LL USE A

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.664 region:rollup2

GENERAL'S OFFICE.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:27.804 region:rollup2
AYE WITH REGARD TO SELL FUNDING

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.972 region:rollup2
WHICH IS CERTAINLY LEGITIMATELY

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.607 region:rollup2
A CONCERN OF YOURS.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:32.742 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO LACK OF

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:34.744 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF FUNDING

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.278 region:rollup2
OF MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.781 region:rollup2
MATTERS THAT WEEK THAT WE

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:40.383 region:rollup2
PURSUE.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:43.119 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY NOT. MONEY

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:44.688 region:rollup2
GENERATORS FOR THE SECTION A

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:46.756 region:rollup2
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:47.857 region:rollup2
FULLER A CASE THAT DATA. IDEA

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:50.627 region:rollup2
TOURNEY GENERAL MENTIONED IN HIS

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:51.661 region:rollup2
SIGHT AND HIS INITIAL REMARKS.

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:53.763 region:rollup2
MERGERS IN GENERAL.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.999 region:rollup2
CAN BE INORDINATELY IMPORTANT

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:59.169 region:rollup2
TO OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:03:55.999 --> 01:04:00.904 region:rollup2
CAN'T NECESSARILY RELY. ON

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.405 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:04.741 region:rollup2
PROTECT US.

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:06.009 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SPECIAL ISSUES AND

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:09.713 region:rollup2
SPECIAL NEEDS.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:11.848 region:rollup2
IN AREAS LIKE AGRICULTURE A IN

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:13.350 region:rollup2
GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS IS IF IF

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:15.952 region:rollup2
ITS A GOOD CASE THE PARTIES WILL

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.554 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WALK AWAY FROM THE MERGER

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:19.756 region:rollup2
THEY'LL ABANDON THE TRANSACTION.

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:21.991 region:rollup2
BEFORE LAWSUIT IS FILED BY SO

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:23.760 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TRIAL AND THERE'S NO

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:26.262 region:rollup2
WAY TO RECOUP. BY THE

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.696 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE COSTS.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.932 region:rollup2
SO.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
TO TO MOVE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:32.369 region:rollup2
INTO PURSUING.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:34.204 region:rollup2
SO FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES HAS

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:36.139 region:rollup2
NEVER MADE SENSE FOR THE SECTION

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:38.775 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:41.344 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN FULLY SELF FUNDED

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.545 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT IT ISN'T

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.880 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER AREAS.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.381 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO LACK OF

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.283 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT BUT OF

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.651 region:rollup2
COURSE IF WE PURSUE THOSE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:50.487 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IT TAKES RESOURCES

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:53.256 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:55.024 region:rollup2
DOES OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:58.027 region:rollup2
WE THINK UP MATTER.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:05:01.531 region:rollup2
IT AT LEAST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:02.565 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO TO THE ECONOMY BY IT IT

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:06.970 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:08.438 region:rollup2
IT WAIT WE CAN SHIFT THAT MIX.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.672 region:rollup2
IT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:13.076 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND BUT WHAT IT WHAT IT

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:14.611 region:rollup2
WOULD MEAN IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.979 region:rollup2
PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT. AT

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:19.048 region:rollup2
WHATEVER LEVEL.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:21.184 region:rollup2
WE CAN MEET THE SELF FINANCING

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:24.287 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:26.156 region:rollup2
BECOME IT'S A QUESTION FROM

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:27.323 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THIS LACKEY AGAIN JUST

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:29.292 region:rollup2
REAL QUICK.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:31.528 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION PIECE OF IF I COULD

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:32.929 region:rollup2
JUST USE SOME NUMBERS MAYBE.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.563 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SAYING IT STRAIGHT BUT

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.798 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE NUMBERS AND LOOKING

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.499 region:rollup2
AT.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:38.368 region:rollup2
THE AYE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT FOUR

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:39.669 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:41.371 region:rollup2
FROM A SPECIAL FUND INCREASE.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:42.138 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:45.675 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.111 region:rollup2
FROM FOURTEEN TO TWENTY THREE

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:50.213 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.548 region:rollup2
SIXTY FOUR PERCENT INCREASE.

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:52.782 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN INCREASE THE TOTAL

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:53.883 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF MATTERS AND I TRUST

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.718 region:rollup2
SECTION CAN HANDLE BY ONLY EIGHT

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:57.487 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.721 region:rollup2
FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:02.158 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THE

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:02.826 region:rollup2
TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:04.561 region:rollup2
OF WORK.

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:06.763 region:rollup2
WOULD ONLY BE A HUNDRED THIRTY

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:08.198 region:rollup2
WONDER POINT THREE PERCENT.

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:09.666 region:rollup2
FOLKS FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:12.101 region:rollup2
FORTY HOURS TO FORTY THOUSAND

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:14.470 region:rollup2
THREE SEVENTY ONE.

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:16.573 region:rollup2
SO DOING THAT MATTHEW WOULD COST

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.507 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:20.610 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR THIRTY THREE DOLLARS

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:22.745 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY EXTRA HOUR OF WORK.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.014 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY BIG NUMBER.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:27.717 region:rollup2
.

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:28.718 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE KELSO WOULD BE.

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.919 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:31.387 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OR OF TOGETHER SIX

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:33.490 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND OUR.

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:35.058 region:rollup2
SO IN SHORT IT SEEMS LIKE. THE

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:38.127 region:rollup2
RETURN VERSE THE INVESTMENT.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:40.363 region:rollup2
AS A PROBLEM.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:43.032 region:rollup2
.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:44.968 region:rollup2
I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN OF MATH

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:45.535 region:rollup2
BUT I IF I COULD GIVE YOU AN

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:47.570 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:49.906 region:rollup2
OF.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.641 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE MOMENT EVERYONE IS

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:52.442 region:rollup2
VERY VERY MY MATH IS OFF THAT NO

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:54.744 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:57.814 region:rollup2
MATHIS OFF BUT I'M SAYING THAT.

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:59.916 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THAT REFLECTS IS THAT

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:01.718 region:rollup2
WE ARE? OF WHERE.

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:03.019 region:rollup2
.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:05.788 region:rollup2
MY FOLKS ARE TOO THINLY

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2
STRETCHED OVER TOO MANY MATTERS

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:10.593 region:rollup2
RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. BY AND WHAT

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:12.161 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHAT WHAT

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:14.898 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN THE FULLER A CASE WE

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:16.1000 region:rollup2
HAD SOMEONE DEVOTING HALF TIME.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:18.134 region:rollup2
TO THE INVESTIGATION.

01:07:16.1000 --> 01:07:20.203 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:22.539 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND KIND OF RELYING

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.705 region:rollup2
ON THEM TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.207 region:rollup2
IF.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.175 region:rollup2
IF.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:28.278 region:rollup2
THE NEED OCCURRED.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:29.879 region:rollup2
THEY WALKED AWAY SO ALL OF US

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:30.647 region:rollup2
AND SUDDENLY WE HAD TO GO TO

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.916 region:rollup2
COURT.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:34.984 region:rollup2
VERY DRAMATICALLY AND WE HAD TO

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:37.387 region:rollup2
GO FROM A HALF A PERSON TO ABOUT

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:38.788 region:rollup2
TEN PEOPLE. TO PREPARE THE CASE

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:40.256 region:rollup2
WE FOUND SEVERAL OF THEM

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:42.959 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY WE PULL THEM AWAY%

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:44.260 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER. OTHER MATTERS LA BUT

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:47.730 region:rollup2
WE WENT OUTSIDE.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:49.732 region:rollup2
FOR OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND THAT

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.334 region:rollup2
AND THAT RAN US TO ABOUT SIX

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.635 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IT

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:54.771 region:rollup2
WAS A BURN RATE OF ABOUT FIFTY

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.038 region:rollup2
THOUSAND A WEEK. WHILE IT WAS

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.140 region:rollup2
GOING ON.

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:59.242 region:rollup2
.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.310 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE THINGS WILL COME UP

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.013 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL SAY THAT HAD WE BEEN

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:06.916 region:rollup2
ABLE TO STAFF PROPERLY WHICH IS

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:08.051 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY TWO? ATTORNEYS OF FROM

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.718 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:11.287 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:13.022 region:rollup2
.

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:14.791 region:rollup2
WE STILL WOULD HAVE NEEDED MORE

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:16.359 region:rollup2
WHEN THE MOMENT CAME BUT WE

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:17.727 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED AS MUCH

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.762 region:rollup2
MORE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.229 region:rollup2
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO RELY IS

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.765 region:rollup2
HEAVILY ON THE FEDERAL

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.466 region:rollup2
ENFORCERS.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.235 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:28.371 region:rollup2
FOR THE RESPONSE WHEN IT CAME.

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:30.039 region:rollup2
BY AND WE WE JUST GENERALLY

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:31.741 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE HAD MORE A MORE

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:33.176 region:rollup2
VIABLE.

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:37.146 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:37.647 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR. A FOR

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.948 region:rollup2
MEETING THOSE KINDS OF

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:41.284 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND IT'S MORE AND

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:43.419 region:rollup2
MORE CLEAR. AYE IN THE CURRENT

01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:44.854 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:46.656 region:rollup2
NEED TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:49.626 region:rollup2
SO IT'S GONNA BE A HEAVIER

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:51.628 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON THE CASES THAT WILL

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:54.163 region:rollup2
IN A NUMBER OF CASES GIVE US.

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:55.231 region:rollup2
MORE ATTORNEYS FEES.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.899 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WILL APPLY

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:58.134 region:rollup2
FOR ATTORNEYS FEES WHERE WE HAVE

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.603 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.571 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.739 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:05.441 region:rollup2
THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE.

01:09:02.739 --> 01:09:07.610 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD THAT IS

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.811 region:rollup2
NOT SOME KIND OF THE MATCHING

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:11.180 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE TO THE REQUEST FOR.

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:12.115 region:rollup2
THE POSITIONS RIGHT IT DOUBLING

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.449 region:rollup2
YOUR STAFFING.

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:15.151 region:rollup2
GET YOU'RE NOT DOUBLING THE

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:17.120 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:19.555 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.323 region:rollup2
BE ADDRESSED. THAT ELLIOT WAS

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:21.758 region:rollup2
BROUGHT OUT IN A BIG MY MEMBER

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.525 region:rollup2
HERE WAS BRINGING OUT THAT IF

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:24.694 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO.

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:26.696 region:rollup2
THING NAM ASSUMPTION IS THAT IF

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:28.364 region:rollup2
YOU IF YOU W. STAFF MOSTLY

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:30.199 region:rollup2
DOUBLING THE WORKLOAD UNLESS

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:31.501 region:rollup2
YOU'VE WORKED EXTREMELY

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:32.769 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAFFED AT THE BEGINNING.

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.137 region:rollup2
SO ALL THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.471 region:rollup2
THAT WE'D PROBABLY A LOT MORE

01:09:34.137 --> 01:09:36.939 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION ON AND IT YELLOWS

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:38.608 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THAT YOU GET NINE

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.509 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ISSUE AND INTO AN

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.210 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:43.046 region:rollup2
IS A YEAR AFTER SEE IF THAT'S

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.479 region:rollup2
OKAY RATHER AN UPFRONT LOW

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE OF HIS

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.982 region:rollup2
COMPOSITIONS.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:47.884 region:rollup2
FOUGHT IN THE BUDGET THAT

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:49.886 region:rollup2
ATTACHED TO IT AND YET WOULD NOT

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:51.087 region:rollup2
SHOOT THAT REALLY WHAT IS WANTED

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.422 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE WORK CLOTHES THAT

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:55.058 region:rollup2
YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WORKLOAD

01:09:52.422 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO INCREASE. BUT IT

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:59.829 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM AS IF IT'S ON A

01:09:56.125 --> 01:10:01.631 region:rollup2
DOUBLE BUT I'M NOT SURE AS YOU

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:05.068 region:rollup2
POINT OUT WHERE THE NOT THE

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:05.668 region:rollup2
CURRENT WORKLOADS ADEQUATE. OF

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:07.637 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:10.139 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES IF THAT IF YOU'RE

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:12.075 region:rollup2
GETTING ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:13.810 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMING IN THEN WILL FUND

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:16.145 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. BUT IF

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:19.115 region:rollup2
IT HAS NOT BEEN COMPARABLE FROM

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:21.551 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING VENUE NOT ONLY

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:24.087 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:27.056 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE FUNDING THE BACKLOG

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:29.592 region:rollup2
OF WORK THAT WAS NOT DONE. AND I

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:34.130 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THE LOGIC IS

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:37.366 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IT IT IS GIVING IN

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:42.105 region:rollup2
MIND THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE A

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:42.705 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFF SHOP FOR. SO IT'S NOT

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:54.450 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK WORK WE

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:56.052 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD RULE THE WHOLE THAT

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.586 region:rollup2
OPEN

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:57.520 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.955 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.158 region:rollup2
CONCERNING. THE WORKLOAD AND ITS

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:03.960 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP TO THE REQUEST.

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:11.267 region:rollup2
THIRD ITEM IS THE GAP BUREAU OF

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:12.435 region:rollup2
GAMBLING IN CONTROL.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.603 region:rollup2
CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:15.338 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE POINT

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.606 region:rollup2
SIX MILLION FOR SPECIAL FUND.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:18.407 region:rollup2
REQUESTING AN ARMY TATIAN FORGET

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.742 region:rollup2
FROM THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.910 region:rollup2
TO FUND TWELVE EXISTING

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:22.178 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:25.081 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY GRANTED

01:11:22.178 --> 01:11:29.152 region:rollup2
I'M AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN.

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:29.819 region:rollup2
OKAY ANY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:30.787 region:rollup2
FROM STAFF. DELEO.

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:32.922 region:rollup2
WE ARE RECOMMENDING EXTENDING

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:34.924 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FOR ONE ADDITIONAL

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:35.925 region:rollup2
YEAR RATHER THAN ON AN ONGOING

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:38.361 region:rollup2
BASIS IS PROPOSED.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:40.163 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU THIS WILL ALLOW DOJ

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:41.831 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO WORK DOWN THE

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:42.765 region:rollup2
BACKLOG BUT WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:44.801 region:rollup2
THE COLLECTION OF ADDITIONAL

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:45.768 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD DATA IN TWO THOUSAND

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.236 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EAT.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.471 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY THIS ADDITIONAL

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:50.773 region:rollup2
DATA IS NEEDED.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:53.109 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE FULL IMPACT OF

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:54.243 region:rollup2
ALL THIRTY TO LIMITED TERM

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.778 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:57.980 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU TO WORK

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.515 region:rollup2
DOWN THE BACKLOG. IS UNCERTAIN

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.516 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I SEE THIRTY TWO IT'S

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.185 region:rollup2
THE TWELVE THAT ARE BEFORE YOU

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:04.320 region:rollup2
TODAY AS WELL AS TWENTY THAT

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:05.221 region:rollup2
EXPIRE AT THE END OF TWO

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.689 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:08.191 region:rollup2
AND SO THE WORKLOAD IS

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.759 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND

01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:11.761 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS THE FIRST

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:13.129 region:rollup2
YEAR IN WHICH NEARLY ALL OF THE

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:15.198 region:rollup2
LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WILL BE

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.999 region:rollup2
STAFFED I MEAN THAT'S POINT ONE.

01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:18.734 region:rollup2
LEADING THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.002 region:rollup2
ANALYSTS AS THEY HAVE BEEN

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.304 region:rollup2
AROUND A BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.705 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BECOME MORE

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:23.973 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.740 region:rollup2
OVERTIME.

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:26.075 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.643 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT HAVING THIS

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.778 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ROOM MAKES IT REALLY

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.513 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:32.715 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:34.684 region:rollup2
RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE BUREAU

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:36.619 region:rollup2
TO AVOID A PERMANENT LARGE

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:38.554 region:rollup2
BACKLOG IN THE FUTURE. ANSWER

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:40.890 region:rollup2
DOJ IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATING THAT

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:43.025 region:rollup2
EACH OF ITS ANALYSTS ON AVERAGE

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:44.493 region:rollup2
WILL CLOSE OUT APPROXIMATELY ONE

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND ELEVEN CASES. IN

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:48.497 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN HOWEVER

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:50.099 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY IT'S ANALYSTS HAVE

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:51.801 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT A MUCH HIGHER

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:53.569 region:rollup2
RATE OF CASES AND SO THIS

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:54.937 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.173 region:rollup2
OF CASES CLOSED IN SEVENTEEN

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:58.074 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SHOULD BE HIGHER

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:59.208 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BY SEVERAL HUNDRED.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.576 region:rollup2
AND SO PROVIDING THE RESOURCES

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.411 region:rollup2
FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR AS WE

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:03.846 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND MEANS THAT ALL OF THE

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:05.915 region:rollup2

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:40.516 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
OUR KIDS.

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.718 region:rollup2
I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S A WHERE

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:44.320 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION TO HAVE BUT I

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:46.822 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE NOT THE ONLY PARTNER

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.490 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN IN THIS PROCESS. I

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:50.326 region:rollup2
THINK NGUYEN JCPS WAS INITIALLY

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:52.728 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED IT WAS PURELY FOR

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:54.363 region:rollup2
STATISTICAL PURPOSES AND IT

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.531 region:rollup2
REALLY DOESN'T TRACK A JUVENILE

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:57.199 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS TALKING A

01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:58.801 region:rollup2
REFERRAL THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND

01:18:57.199 --> 01:19:00.970 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT REFERRAL.

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:02.438 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE AN

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:04.006 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL IN THERE ARE MULTIPLE

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:06.208 region:rollup2
TIMES IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE

01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:08.143 region:rollup2
REFERRALS AND SO TO BE CHANGING

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:09.912 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE BASIS AND FOUNDATION I

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:12.481 region:rollup2
THINK THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.382 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT WOULD THAT

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.583 region:rollup2
REQUIRES SOME.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.551 region:rollup2
FURTHER DISCUSSION I THINK WITH

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.219 region:rollup2
WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:18.554 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:21.423 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A THRESHOLD QUESTION

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:23.726 region:rollup2
IS HOW INTERESTED IS DOJ AND. IN

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:25.828 region:rollup2
PURSUING THIS IF WE WERE TO

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:28.464 region:rollup2
START TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:29.965 region:rollup2
AND REALLY LOOK AT. THE THAT THE

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:31.200 region:rollup2
DATA COLLECTION AND AND HOW WE

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:34.603 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ROBUST AND

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.972 region:rollup2
ALL THAT UNFUNDED. RIGHT AND

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:40.042 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW IT INDICATE WAS I NOT

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:43.212 region:rollup2
HER DID YOU EARLIER RIGHT YEAH.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:44.246 region:rollup2
YEAH NON UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:45.381 region:rollup2
THE TIME WELL WORTH IT FOR US.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:46.915 region:rollup2
TO INVEST IN IN IN IN A SOLID

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.516 region:rollup2
DATA SYSTEM IF WE CAN GET THERE

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.517 region:rollup2
NOW THE CAT GOT IS WE'VE HAD

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.351 region:rollup2
LOTS OF OTHER DATA SYSTEMS THAT

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.119 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN. EMBARKED ON THAT

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.920 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN COLOSSAL FAILURES AND

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:54.623 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.658 region:rollup2
THROWN DOWN THE DRAIN SO.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.626 region:rollup2
FIRST THING WE NEED TO KNOW IS

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:58.994 region:rollup2
THE WILLINGNESS.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.896 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS OF OF THE PARTNERS

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:02.331 region:rollup2
TO TO GO GET THE STATE I THINK I

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:03.265 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S NEED I THINK

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.366 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:06.835 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:07.403 region:rollup2
AT. THAT HOW WE PUT TOGETHER

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.104 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE THAT WE HAVE

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:10.339 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE DATA SYSTEM THAT'S

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:12.775 region:rollup2
GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:14.476 region:rollup2
FUNDS. THEIR THEIR CREATION OF

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:17.946 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEM BUT. WE WE NEED TO

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:19.181 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE WE HAVE.

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.482 region:rollup2
STAY CLOSE RIGHT EVERYBODY

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:22.017 region:rollup2
REALLY WILLING TO IT DESIGNED TO

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:23.852 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WORKS SO THAT WE

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:24.386 region:rollup2
CAN TRACK.

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:26.288 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THROUGH THAT TO THE

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.723 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:29.058 region:rollup2
SO I AS I INDICATED EARLIER I

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:30.059 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:31.226 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT IT

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:32.594 region:rollup2
YEAH I WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.829 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN COMMIT

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:35.030 region:rollup2
VERSUS HOW MUCH WERE FUNDED TO

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.266 region:rollup2
DO BUT IT'S THAT CONVERSATION

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.900 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE. A WITH

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:38.967 region:rollup2
THE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND IS ILL

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.902 region:rollup2
ALISON INDICATED THERE ARE OTHER

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.470 region:rollup2
PARTIES.

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:42.604 region:rollup2
AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:44.006 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD NEED TO

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:45.474 region:rollup2
BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:47.476 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE DATA RESIDES AT THE

01:20:45.474 --> 01:20:49.244 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT RIGHT. AND SO

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:50.779 region:rollup2
HAVING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM FOR

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:52.448 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THAT CREATES OTHER

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:54.149 region:rollup2
FISCAL ISSUES.

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:55.851 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOCALS AS WELL.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:57.853 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S IT'S STEP BY

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.854 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE CAN HAPPEN AND

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.955 region:rollup2
AS YOU INDICATE SAW EARLIER AT

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:01.423 region:rollup2
THE AGE IS VERY INTERESTED IN

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:03.759 region:rollup2
AND MANY THINGS BUT AGAIN. WE

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:05.194 region:rollup2
CAUTION HOW MUCH. WE CAN COMMIT

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:07.096 region:rollup2
GIVEN YOU KNOW THE FUNDING

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:08.163 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.831 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:09.064 region:rollup2
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M NOT

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:13.102 region:rollup2
ASKING.

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:15.137 region:rollup2
TO.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:16.472 region:rollup2
THEY EXPEND MONEY NOW TO SOLVE A

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2
PROBLEM I WOULD TRY TO DEFINE

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:20.576 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM MAKE SURE LEADING WE

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:21.210 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT'S.

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:22.111 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY WHAT'S NEED BUT HOW

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.778 region:rollup2
WE DESIGN IT AND HAVE A

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:25.347 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT'S KIND OF

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:26.515 region:rollup2
TOP DOWN. DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK I

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.915 region:rollup2
THINK WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:29.218 region:rollup2
WERE WHO THE LOCAL

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:30.119 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.987 region:rollup2
FUNNY WHAT THEY DO HAVE AND CAN

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.021 region:rollup2
DO AND THEN INSURE THAT THAT

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.356 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WAY FOR THAT DATA THEN

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.691 region:rollup2
TO GET COLLECTED UP SO THAT WE

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:37.426 region:rollup2
CAN START TO. ASK THOSE

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:38.727 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:40.229 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS A STATE INTEREST IN

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.630 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE OF THE THERE ARE A

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:43.799 region:rollup2
LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.534 region:rollup2
JUVENILES TEND TO MOVE COUNTY TO

01:21:43.799 --> 01:21:47.836 region:rollup2
COUNTY DIFFER PROGRAM SPECIAL IN

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:49.037 region:rollup2
THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM NOW

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:51.373 region:rollup2
EVEN JUST INVOLVED JUSTICE.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:53.675 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:54.977 region:rollup2
PROBATION OFFICES AND SWITCHING

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:57.179 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES

01:21:54.977 --> 01:22:00.416 region:rollup2
LOOKING IT REGIONAL RESOURCES TO

01:21:57.179 --> 01:22:01.850 region:rollup2
HELP.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:02.985 region:rollup2
HELP THEM SOLVE SOME ISSUES THAT

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.619 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE IS SOMETHING THAT A

01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:04.853 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THEM ARE INTERESTED

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:07.456 region:rollup2
AND. SO IN THIS BROADER

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:10.092 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION HAVING BAD DATA TO

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:11.560 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.862 region:rollup2
WORKING AND AND THAT'S WHAT NEXT

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.997 region:rollup2
ERECTIONS ARE. IT'S IT'S GONNA

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:16.598 region:rollup2
BE ULTIMATELY VERY IMPORTANT.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:17.666 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.467 region:rollup2
CAN IT IN THE COMMENTS OR

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.034 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:23.372 region:rollup2
THIS.

LEGISLATURE BACK IN AND TWENTY

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.796 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN. WE ARE ISSUED.

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.531 region:rollup2
ALIKE TO HEAR SEVENTY PAGES OF

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:51.733 region:rollup2
REPORT. OF LOOKING

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:53.135 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVELY AT A JC PSS THE

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:54.703 region:rollup2
ITEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.704 region:rollup2
AND ALL NEEDS A ACROSS THE

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:57.573 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OUTCOME MEASURES FOR

01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:01.944 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. AND JUST

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:02.311 region:rollup2
FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE DATA

01:23:01.944 --> 01:23:04.279 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ITSELF.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:05.681 region:rollup2
OUR NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:07.216 region:rollup2
WAS TO REPAIR THE BROKEN

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:08.951 region:rollup2
JUVENILE COURT AND I AM

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:10.719 region:rollup2
PREVENTION STATISTICAL SYSTEM.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:11.353 region:rollup2
AND I COULD TAKE UP MORE TIME

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.655 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH A LITANY OF WHAT'S

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:14.523 region:rollup2
WRONG. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.490 region:rollup2
THAT'S MISSING IS WE HAVE NO

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:17.459 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:19.695 region:rollup2

JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:28.370 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY. THE GOLD STANDARD

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:29.137 region:rollup2
IS THE BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:31.507 region:rollup2
VETS BACKED.

THAT.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.650 region:rollup2
IN OTHER YOUTH SERVING ROAMS.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.851 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:45.153 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN UPGRADING THE

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:48.223 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT THE POLICY

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:50.025 region:rollup2

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:27.329 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:29.731 region:rollup2

INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS.

01:28:06.715 --> 01:28:10.285 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:12.187 region:rollup2
HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO SERVICE

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:13.755 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CADETS

01:28:12.187 --> 01:28:14.990 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE?

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM PRODUCES SOME PRETTY

01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:18.760 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIVE RESULTS.

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:19.427 region:rollup2
IF A CHILD OR STUDENT IS

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:36.545 region:rollup2
VERY VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. THE

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:38.513 region:rollup2

THE ONGOING COSTS FOR WHICH WE

FEW OTHERS.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:34.168 region:rollup2
BUT THIRD THERE'S ALSO

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.069 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY OVER THE

01:49:34.168 --> 01:49:36.770 region:rollup2

REQUIRED TO COVER THE REMAINING

01:49:44.912 --> 01:49:48.415 region:rollup2
ONGOING COSTS.

01:49:46.547 --> 01:49:50.884 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:52.453 region:rollup2

01:49:50.884 --> 01:49:54.021 region:rollup2
FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES IT IN

01:49:52.453 --> 01:49:55.255 region:rollup2
THE PAST.

01:49:54.021 --> 01:49:56.590 region:rollup2
AND THAT ARE ONE OF THE GOALS OF

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:58.425 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS PLAN IS TO IDENTIFY

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:59.793 region:rollup2
NOT JOURNAL FUND REVENUE SOURCES

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.794 region:rollup2

01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:02.129 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:03.097 region:rollup2
NOT COMMITTED TO COVER ALL OF

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:08.168 region:rollup2
WITH NIGEL FUND SOURCES.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.503 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE BELIEVE BY THAT

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:11.205 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SHE SHOULD

01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:12.906 region:rollup2
PROVIDE LEGISLATURE WITH A

ONE.

01:52:34.648 --> 01:52:38.085 region:rollup2
OKAY WE REALIZE THAT ON THERE

01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:41.455 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERNS ON.

01:52:38.085 --> 01:52:42.089 region:rollup2
WHERE THE STATUS OF CERTAIN IS

ONE. AND IT'S BEEN CRITICAL.

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.766 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW THIS LAST YEAR.

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:54.234 region:rollup2
WE HAD.

DISASTERS.

01:52:55.736 --> 01:53:00.007 region:rollup2
AND IT HIGHLIGHTED THE

01:52:57.738 --> 01:53:02.309 region:rollup2
NECESSITY OF A.

01:53:00.007 --> 01:53:04.244 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW VERY EFFICIENT AND

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:05.579 region:rollup2
RELIABLE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM FOR

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:53:05.579 --> 01:53:09.182 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:10.784 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY FOR GONNA IMPROVE

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
REDUNDANCY INTO FOR GUN IMPROVE

01:53:10.784 --> 01:53:14.354 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY WE HAVE TO MOVE

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.789 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH THE NEXT GENERATION

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:19.126 region:rollup2
NINE ONE ONE PROGRAM FOR US.

01:53:15.789 --> 01:53:20.027 region:rollup2
.

01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:21.662 region:rollup2
AND OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO

01:53:20.027 --> 01:53:24.498 region:rollup2
LEAD THE NATIONAL.

01:53:21.662 --> 01:53:26.300 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURE ON NINE ONE ONE

01:53:24.498 --> 01:53:27.968 region:rollup2
FOR ME TO BE PART OF THAT DESIGN

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.502 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STANDARDS IN MAKING

01:53:27.968 --> 01:53:29.603 region:rollup2
THAT FOR WE HAVE TO BE OUT

01:53:28.502 --> 01:53:32.105 region:rollup2
FRONT.

01:53:29.603 --> 01:53:33.440 region:rollup2
OF FROM RIGHT NOW WERE ON THE

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:35.609 region:rollup2
CUSP OF MOVING FORWARD WE'VE

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.443 region:rollup2
DONE THE PLANNING WOULD ON THE

01:53:35.609 --> 01:53:39.179 region:rollup2
STAFFING WOULD ON THE PILOTS.

01:53:36.443 --> 01:53:40.480 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED THESE POSITIONS AND

01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:41.281 region:rollup2
THEN ULTIMATELY EVER INDEED THE

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.816 region:rollup2
SPELLING CHRIS SPENDING

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:44.885 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY WITHIN THE SECOND

ACCOUNT. TO MAKE THIS A REALITY

01:53:44.885 --> 01:53:48.655 region:rollup2
OF FOR US.

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:50.290 region:rollup2
.

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:51.858 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PIECE TO THIS IS THAT

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:54.294 region:rollup2
THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:55.228 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO COME DOWN TO ASSIST

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:57.331 region:rollup2
US WITH NEXT GENERATION I WON

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:58.999 region:rollup2
ONE. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:53:57.331 --> 01:54:00.434 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO EXECUTE IT. AND SO

01:53:58.999 --> 01:54:03.070 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING.

01:54:00.434 --> 01:54:04.237 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY AND THE POSITIONS.

01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:06.273 region:rollup2
IF WE GOT THE MONEY WE WOULD

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:07.407 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO TO MOVE

01:54:06.273 --> 01:54:07.841 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:09.810 region:rollup2
WITH THAT FEDERAL.

01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:11.311 region:rollup2
MODEL NOW WE HAVEN'T GOT A

01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:11.978 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE WHEN THAT MONEY'S

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.246 region:rollup2
GOING TO COME OR IF IT'S GOING

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:14.915 region:rollup2
TO COME. BUT WE KNOW THE

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:17.117 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS TAKING PLACE AT THE

01:54:14.915 --> 01:54:19.519 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL NOW AND THERE'S.

01:54:17.117 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2
INCREASED INTEREST ON MOVING

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.655 region:rollup2
MONEY TO THE STATES FOR NEXT

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:24.024 region:rollup2
GENERATION I WON BECAUSE THEY

01:54:21.655 --> 01:54:25.325 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE. HOW IMPORTANT IS AS

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:27.461 region:rollup2
WELL?

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:27.994 region:rollup2
A WE HAD TWENTY MILLION CALLS

01:54:27.461 --> 01:54:29.296 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR IN THE NINE ONE

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:31.264 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:54:29.296 --> 01:54:33.834 region:rollup2
AND AND WE SEE NO REASON FOR

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:35.535 region:rollup2
THAT TO DECREASE AT ALL AND IN

01:54:33.834 --> 01:54:37.471 region:rollup2
FACT WILL LIKELY INCREASE TO IT.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:38.739 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SEEING SOME FASTENING

01:54:37.471 --> 01:54:40.540 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS AS WE'RE MOVING TO

01:54:38.739 --> 01:54:41.942 region:rollup2
TEXAS NINE ONE ONE IN OTHER

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:43.844 region:rollup2
AREAS FOR IT.

01:54:41.942 --> 01:54:45.712 region:rollup2
SO. WELL WITH THAT I HAVE

01:54:43.844 --> 01:54:46.747 region:rollup2
BUDGET CURRIER WHO'S MY NINE ONE

THIS GRAPHIC HERE CONNECTING THE

01:55:05.899 --> 01:55:09.436 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY. WE KNOW THE SPACE

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:10.837 region:rollup2
IS.

01:55:09.436 --> 01:55:13.507 region:rollup2
A CONFUSING AND.

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:14.875 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC AND SO THIS GRAPHIC IS

01:55:13.507 --> 01:55:16.510 region:rollup2
TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THESE

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:18.245 region:rollup2
CONNECT THESE TECHNOLOGIES

01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:20.213 region:rollup2
CONNECT ONE WITH ANOTHER. CC

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:21.381 region:rollup2
NEXT GEN NOT NINE ONE IS ON THIS

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:23.650 region:rollup2
GRAPHIC AND THAT'S REALLY

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:24.718 region:rollup2

DEVICES. NEXT GEN I'M ONE IS HOW

01:55:27.521 --> 01:55:30.957 region:rollup2
YOU GET THAT INFORMATION INVOICE

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:32.626 region:rollup2
INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:34.261 region:rollup2
POINT. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

01:55:32.626 --> 01:55:35.595 region:rollup2
COORDINATE THE RESPONSE TO MAKE

01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:36.329 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE HELP YOU NEED

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.564 region:rollup2
ARRIVES

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:38.899 region:rollup2
SO NEXT GEN I'M ONE IS A

01:55:37.564 --> 01:55:40.801 region:rollup2
CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS

01:55:38.899 --> 01:55:42.035 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. ONCE IT ARRIVES

01:55:40.801 --> 01:55:43.303 region:rollup2
AT THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:45.272 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINT THEY'RE USING

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:47.674 region:rollup2
LAND MOBILE RADIO TO COORDINATE.

01:55:45.272 --> 01:55:48.241 region:rollup2
DISPATCH OPERATIONS WITH THOSE

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:50.544 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS IN THE

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:52.479 region:rollup2
FIELD AND THEN THE FIRST MATTER

01:55:50.544 --> 01:55:54.381 region:rollup2
BROADBAND SERVICES IS HOW THAT

01:55:52.479 --> 01:55:56.783 region:rollup2
DATA IS GETTING FROM THE PUBLIC

01:55:54.381 --> 01:55:57.918 region:rollup2
SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. OUT TO

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:59.286 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS

01:55:57.918 --> 01:56:01.188 region:rollup2
AND THEN ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF

01:55:59.286 --> 01:56:02.756 region:rollup2
THE GRAPHIC WAS SHOWN THIS IS A

01:56:01.188 --> 01:56:04.157 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PATH BECAUSE IT IS.

01:56:02.756 --> 01:56:05.559 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT ALERTS

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:07.627 region:rollup2
AND WARNINGS WOULD WOULD BE

01:56:05.559 --> 01:56:08.995 region:rollup2
UPSET FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:10.864 region:rollup2
ANSWERING POINT OF THE LOCAL

01:56:08.995 --> 01:56:12.799 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY THAT SITE AUTHORIZED

01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:14.801 region:rollup2
TO SEND THAT ALERT WARNING. BACK

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:16.269 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE TO THOSE THAT THAT

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:17.637 region:rollup2
NEED TO RECEIVE THOSE WARNINGS.

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:19.673 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE WITH

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:22.008 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FLOW HERE NEXT

01:56:19.673 --> 01:56:23.677 region:rollup2
JANICE IS CRITICAL TO BRING THIS

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:26.012 region:rollup2
DATA INTO THE NINE ONE.

01:56:23.677 --> 01:56:27.280 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS.

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:28.782 region:rollup2
THE NEXT GRAPHIC JUST REALLY

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.317 region:rollup2
KIND HIGHLIGHTS THAT IMPORTANCE.

01:56:28.782 --> 01:56:31.751 region:rollup2
.

01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:33.720 region:rollup2
NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE IS

UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TRANSITION

TO NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE.

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:58.144 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF WE

ADVANTAGES OVER OUR CURRENT

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:06.419 region:rollup2
NETWORK. PROBABLY THE BEST

01:57:04.918 --> 01:57:08.221 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE IS DURING THE

01:57:06.419 --> 01:57:08.655 region:rollup2

BOTH HAVE TO EVACUATE WHICH IS

01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:26.840 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED IN OR FULL.

NETWORK THAT INTERCONNECTS ALL

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:31.278 region:rollup2

LITERALLY BE ANSWERED ANYWHERE.

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:36.516 region:rollup2
AND HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:38.018 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES AS WELL INCREASED

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:39.319 region:rollup2
DIVE FASTER CALL DELIVERY WERE

01:57:38.018 --> 01:57:41.855 region:rollup2
POSITION BETTER FOR INCREASED

01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:43.490 region:rollup2
THOUGH CASH LOCATION ACCURACY.

01:57:41.855 --> 01:57:45.725 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE DATA RICH

POSITIONS US FOR THAT.

01:57:51.865 --> 01:57:54.501 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE WE FEEL IT'S

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:56.503 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:57:54.501 --> 01:57:57.671 region:rollup2
OMINOUS MITCH SAIDWE WE DO HAVE

01:57:56.503 --> 01:57:59.839 region:rollup2

A REVENUE SOURCE AND AND AND

01:58:05.979 --> 01:58:09.516 region:rollup2
THE SET THE FUND AND HOW IT'S

01:58:07.581 --> 01:58:11.518 region:rollup2
BEEN DECLINING. A REALLY THAT'S

01:58:09.516 --> 01:58:13.553 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY DO SO THAT'S THIS NEXT

01:58:11.518 --> 01:58:14.654 region:rollup2
GRAPH THAT YOU SEE HERE. ON THAT

01:58:13.553 --> 01:58:16.790 region:rollup2
THE CHARTS.

01:58:14.654 --> 01:58:18.158 region:rollup2
AS IT GOES DOWN.

01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:19.926 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW OUR FUNDING MODEL IS

01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:22.128 region:rollup2
BASED ON INTEREST STATE VOICE IT

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:23.563 region:rollup2
WAS A FANTASTIC MODEL BEFORE THE

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:24.831 region:rollup2
INVENTION OF SMARTPHONES.

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:26.499 region:rollup2
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:28.735 region:rollup2
SMARTPHONES A MAJORITY OF OF

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:30.036 region:rollup2
YOUR WIRELESS PHONE BILL GOES

01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:32.439 region:rollup2
TOWARD DATA AND NOT VOICE

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:33.006 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT REVENUE. IT IS NOT

01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:35.041 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'RE COLLECTING

01:58:33.006 --> 01:58:36.710 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE D. DATA REVENUE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:38.345 region:rollup2
PORTION OF YOUR WIRELESS BILL.

01:58:36.710 --> 01:58:39.946 region:rollup2
THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THIS RED

01:58:38.345 --> 01:58:42.248 region:rollup2
LINE GOING DOWN ABOUT SIX

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:43.650 region:rollup2
PERCENT PER YEAR AND WE CONTINUE

01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:44.851 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT TREND IT'S IT'S

01:58:43.650 --> 01:58:46.987 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO DROP ABOUT SIX

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:47.821 region:rollup2
PERCENT PER YEAR. SO WE KNOW WE

01:58:46.987 --> 01:58:50.457 region:rollup2
NEED IT.

01:58:47.821 --> 01:58:51.524 region:rollup2
FUNDING MODEL TO SUPPORT THIS

01:58:50.457 --> 01:58:52.492 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TRAILER BILL

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:54.427 region:rollup2

THAT ONCE WE GET THE

01:58:55.095 --> 01:58:58.298 region:rollup2
