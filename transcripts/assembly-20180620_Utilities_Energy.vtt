00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.802
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.603
SUPPORT THE ROLE THAT ENERGY

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.405
STORAGE CAN PLAY --

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:43.606
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE AND WHERE

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:44.374
IT'S COST EFFECTIVE

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.476

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.145
SOME OF THE CHARACTERIZATIONS

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.880
ABOUT HOW THE STORAGE DEVICES

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.082

A RESULT OF THE AFTER PROGRAM

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.695
WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWN IS THAT IT

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.330
INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:08.832
EMISSIONS NOT DECREASING.

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.333
WE AGREE THAT CHARGING THE

DURING THE SYSTEM PEAK IS A GOOD

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:20.677

WHICH IS THAT.

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:53.856
BECAUSE OF THE CRAZY WAY WE SET

RATES.

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:59.929
NAMELY THAT A COMPANY IS CHARGED

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.065
ON ITS MAXIMUM USE EVEN IF IT'S

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.599
A TIME WHEN THERE'S PLENTY OF

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.401
ENERGY.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.903
COMPANIES ARE DOING THE WRONG

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.972

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.710
CORRECT IT.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:14.978
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT A NUDGE IN

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.646

SOMETHING THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.456
FIXED.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.658
IN THE MEANTIME.

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.859
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.628
WE KEEP FAITH WITH THE PROGRAM

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.597

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.299
TRUE WE DID OUR PART IN SOLAR

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.167
HERE IN THE U. S..

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.202
PEOPLE WERE DOING THEIR PART

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:40.370
AROUND THE WORLD IN GERMANY AND

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.338
CHINA.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.307
WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES DOING

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:45.775
THIS WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.777

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:33.756
RECORD WHERE THE AMENDMENTS.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.958
THESE ARE THE A MENACE THAT ARE

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:36.259
ATTACHED --

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:51.574
PAGE.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.276
SEVEN THE BILL WAS ANALYZE

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.445
BECAUSE PROPOSED TO TO BE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.580
AMENDMENTS. TO IT WITH UNITS

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:59.515
OKAY A AND THEN BUT I GUESS MY

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.017
OTHER COMMENT IS IS A ALONG THE

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.752
LINES OF OF MICHAEL THE DOCTOR

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.119
QUIRK AROUND.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.554
I DO THINK WE NEED SOME KIND OF

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.155
WAY TO DO SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.590
TIME OF USE AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.559
USING THE BATTERY --

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.160
BUT I KNOW ESPECIALLY AS IT

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.695
RELATES TO SOME OF THE THE THE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.563
NEW THINGS ARE DOING WITH TAG

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.899
AND AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT.

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:17.300
THEM.

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.668
HOW WE HOW WE USE OUR OUR

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:21.604
RESOURCES THE MOST EFFECTIVELY --

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:22.905
AND AGAIN WITH EXPANSION THIS

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:24.207
PROGRAM AND IN JUST AT THE

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:25.608
CLARIFICATION I I BELIEVE THIS

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:28.211
WORKS VERY WELL WITH THAT A. B..

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:29.378
SIX AND THREE THAT WE DID LAST

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.780
YEAR AMOUNTS OR FOR LOW INCOME

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.616
AND AT 25% AND BE ABLE TO BE

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.884
USED.

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:35.818
FOR AB DOESN'T IT MULTI FAMILY

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.687
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS USING

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:40.089
SOME THE SORT THEN CAN ALSO.

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.924
HAVE ACCESS TO THE BATTERY.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:42.859
RIGHT.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.026
IT IN AGAIN ALONG WITH LINES

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:44.694
WITH A DOCTOR QUICKLY SAYING IT

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.695
WOULD BE VERY NICE TO HAVE SOME

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:46.963
KIND OF GUARDRAILS AROUND TIMES

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.397
ABUSE AND BEING OF THE USE.

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.665
THE POWER IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:50.967
MANNER TO BE ABLE TO REDUCING

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:55.938
GREENHOUSE GAS AND THANK YOU

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.006
MISTER CHAIR I'VE TWO QUESTIONS

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.708
AND SORT OF A COMET.

01:02:58.774 --> 01:02:59.609
I WAS WONDERING IF SOMEBODY

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.110
COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE RAISED

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:01.844
BY THE OPPOSITION --

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:05.081
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN JUST

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.516
COMMENTED ON WITH RESPECT TO

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:07.450
PEOPLE.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:08.718
THIS CHARGING OUT OF THEIR

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:09.852
STORAGE.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.155
NOT AT NIGHTTIME WHEN IN A

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.789
PRODUCTION OF SELLERS GONE ZERO

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.057
BUT AT OTHER TIMES IN THE DAY

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:15.858
WHETHER.

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.860
THAT'S BEEN STUDIED IS THAT.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:18.794
ACCURATE IS THAT NOT ACCURATE

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:23.900
WHAT SORT OF GOING.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.168
THE OTHER THERE TWO ELEMENTS OF

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.602
THAT THAT ARE DRIVING THAT

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.537
CHARGING AND DISCHARGING

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.205
BEHAVIORS ONE IS.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:30.873
THAT WE HAVE THESE WATER OFTEN

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.008
REFERRED HIS LEGACY TIME OF USE

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.843
PERIODS.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.278
BECAUSE BEFORE WE HAD THOUSAND

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:35.878
MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ON THE GRID

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.146
THE PEAK.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.948
I AM INTERVIEWS OCCURRED

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:39.582
GENERALLY FROM TWELVE PM TO SIX

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.117
PM.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.552
AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT TOOK

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:46.556
YEARS FOR THE P..

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:47.156
AND THE VARIOUS RATE CASES TO

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.925
MOVE FROM THOSE LEGACY PERIODS

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.859
TO THE NEW TIME OF USE PERIODS

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.294
THE PEAKS.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.629
THAT REFLECT A ALL THAT ABUNDANT

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:56.432
SOLAR ON THE GRID MID DAY SO THE

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.700
PAPER IS AN HOUR JOHN TO BE

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.136
MOVED TO THREE TO EIGHT FOUR

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:01.504
NINE SOMEWHERE THAT TIME FRAME.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.171
I THINK THAT WILL START TO SEND

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.105
THE RIGHT PRICE SIGNAL TO

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:03.806
CUSTOMERS.

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.575
AND THE OTHER WHICH IS WHAT

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:06.542
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK WAS

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:07.843
REFERRING TO ARE THESE WHAT ARE

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.178
CALLED NON COINCIDENT DEMAND

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:10.947
CHARGES CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.049
THE HIGHEST USE IT REGARDLESS OF

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:13.449
ONE OF THE CARS.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.717
AND THAT IS.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.185
THAT IS A RATE ELEMENT THAT IS

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.954
ACTIVELY UNDER CONSIDERATION AND

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.655
YOU SEE OF THE SUBJECT OF OUR A

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.357
FORM THAT THEY HAD IN DECEMBER

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:22.792
TO LOOK AT REFORMING NON

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.060
RESIDENTIAL RATE DESIGN MORE

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.995
BROADLY SO I WOULD EXPECT SOME

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.163
MOVEMENT THERE.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.531
TO MOVING AWAY FROM THOSE KINDS

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.366
OF DEMAND CHARGES AND PUSHING

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.368
MORE THE REVENUE COLLECTION AND

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:32.668
THE PERIOD.

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.437
THE NEW PERIOD.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.005
OKAY AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.241
DO YOU HAVE DATA ON WHAT.

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:40.943
PERCENTAGE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.511
OUR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:43.913
STORAGE [inaudible]

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.615
CAPABILITY.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:46.649
PRESENTLY AND THEN WHAT IS A

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.384
PROJECTED TO BE.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:52.655
YOU WITH WITH THIS BILL.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:53.889
WELL CURRENTLY THE THE

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:56.492
PENETRATION OF STORAGE IS STILL

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.793
THAT CREDIBLY SMALL THIS IS A

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.762
VERY NASCENT INDUSTRY --

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.197
AT SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.332
SOLAR THAT'S NOT EVEN COMPLETELY

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:04.734
INSTALLED INSTALLED AND ARE IN

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.768
THE PIPELINE.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.637
VERSUS THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:10.339
SOLAR INSTALLED PRESENTLY --

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.642
SO THE PERCENTAGE OF EXISTING

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.209
SYSTEMS WITH STORAGE IS VERY

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.077
SMALL.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.345
PROBABLY NOT EVEN 1%.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.847
I'M HEARING FROM SOME MEMBER

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:19.448
COMPANIES THAT THERE AT LEAST IN

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.483
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.752
REACHING 20% OF NEW CUSTOMERS.

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.620
WHO WERE INSTALLING STORAGE

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.922
ALONG WITH THEIR SOLAR SYSTEMS

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.257
SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:29.525
MARKET IS BEGINNING TO TAKE OFF

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.394
BUT IT WILL BE QUITE SOMETIME

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.295
BEFORE IT REALLY CATCHES UP TO

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:32.928
THE?

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:34.363
THE SATURATION THAT WE'VE

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.165
ACHIEVED WITH ROOFTOP SOLAR.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.301
IS THAT A FUNCTION OF OF COST OF

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:41.203
THE STORAGE SYSTEM PRIMARILY.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.706
IT'S IT'S COST AND THE FACT THAT.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.207
THE THE ENTIRE STORAGE MARKET IN

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.642
THE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS ABOUT

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.210
A DECADE BEHIND SOLAR.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.579
SO I'M IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.448
WHEN THE CSI.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.049
THE CONFERENCE AWARENESS TO

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.984
PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED FIRST IT

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.585
WAS.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.253
TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS DESIGNED

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.488
TO RUN OR FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.056
SEVEN WHEN IT TOOK OVER THE

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.024
PROGRAM FROM ASCAP --

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:06.262
THAT WAS FROM 200-072-2016.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.797
SO OUR FIRST BEGAN TO TAKE OFF

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.132
AROUND 200-082-0009 IF YOU LOOK

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.500
AT THE ESTA DATA EVEN THOUGH.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:14.036
STORAGE WAS ELIGIBLE GOING BACK

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:17.473
TO AROUND TWENTY AROUND AROUND.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.107
TWO THOUSAND NINE TWENTY TEN IT

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.275
ONLY BEGAN TO BE INSTALLED IN

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.677
ANY MEANINGFUL NUMBERS IN TWENTY

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.278
FOURTEEN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.179
THAT.

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:26.749
THAT RAMP UP TO MARKET MATURITY --

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.185
WE WOULDN'T SEE.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:29.785
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.354
REASONS FOR THIS BILL THAT WE

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.421
NEED THE BILL.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.857
WE NEED TO GET THROUGH TWENTY

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:35.458
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:36.759
SOME IN THAT TIME FRAME. TO

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:37.827
ACHIEVE A REALLY MEANINGFUL

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.729
NUMBERS OF OF CUSTOMER CITED

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.198
STORAGE.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.966
I JUST ADD ON TO THAT --

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.067
THAT SEVEN INJURED MEGAWATTS

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.302
THAT WE HAVE IN THE PIPELINE OR

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.303
INSTALLED --

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.271
ARE PRIMARILY ON A LOT AS A

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.906
NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.742
I'M PARTICULARS WHERE WE'VE SEEN

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:53.776
A LOT OF STRONG DEMAND SO WERE.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.010
A PARENTAL AT A BENEFITS TO OUR

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.812
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE SO

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.814
FAR BUT THEY WERE WERE ABOUT

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.883
WHERE SALUTE WAS CIRCA TWO

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:01.450
THOUSAND SEVEN AND WE HAVE A

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.685
LONG WAY TO GO THAT'S WHY THIS

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:03.986
BILL SO NEEDED.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.121
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.856
DIRECTLY IT IS OUR GOAL TO

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:07.757
BASICALLY STOP EVERY SOLAR

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:08.858
SYSTEM WITH PAIRED WITH A

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.893
BATTERY ONCE WE CAN GET THIS

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.361
MARKET OFF THE GROUND THAT THAT

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.497
IS THE VISION OF WHERE WE WANT

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.765
TO HEAD YEAH IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.501
YEAH I IT'S IT'S GOT FASTENING

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:23.005
POTENTIAL BECAUSE I MEAN YOU.

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.306
FOR THE TWO HOURS AFTER THE SUN

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.008
GOES DOWN I THINK THAT THE DATA

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.877
SOMETHING LIKE 36% OF OUR

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.512
STATEWIDE ENERGY GRIDS IMPORTED

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.380
NASH NATURAL GAS.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.982
OR WHAT IS REFERRED TO SPEAKER

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.884
PLANTS OR WHATEVER ELSE AND IF

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.719
THERE COULD BE SATURATION ON

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.187
STORAGE SO THAT ALL ROOF TOP.

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.722
CUSTOMERS ARE STORING ENERGY

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.257
PRODUCED WHEN THE SUN'S OUT.

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.625
AND DEPLOYING IT DURING THAT TWO

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:43.893
HOUR PERIOD I THOUGHT I SEE

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.261
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.762
THE TRICK TO ME IS THAT HOW DO

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:47.730
YOU.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.064
IF YOU HAVE A SOLAR ARRAY

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.332
WITHOUT A STORAGE SYSTEM AND IT

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.333
COVERS A HUNDRED AND 10% OF YOUR

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.169
HOUSEHOLD NEEDS --

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.804
WHAT INCENTIVE DO YOU HAVE TO

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.472
BUY THAT EXTRA MODULE?

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:57.973
STORAGE BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.242
NEED THE BILL [inaudible]

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.077
THERE FAIRPOINT.

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.946
YEAH IF I COULD JUST.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.014
YEAH I THINK THERE'S INTEREST

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.582
FROM THE CONSUMERS E GOT UP GET

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:07.850
THE MARKET TO MATCH THAT

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.585
INTERESTING DRIVE THAT DEMAND

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.953
AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID FOR

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.487
SOLAR.

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:14.056
LA AGAIN THE IT WE NEED TO

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.791
MOTIVATE CONSUMERS TEND TO OFTEN

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:16.926
OUGHT TO THIS TECHNOLOGY AND

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.561
SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS FOR

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.464
INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES.

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.097
OKAY I MEAN THE ONLY OTHER POINT

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:24.300
IT OUT.

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:25.434
BECAUSE TO NICE JOB IN ADVOCACY

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:26.602
BUT NO ONE I THINK TOUCHED ON

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:29.605
THE THE EMPLOYMENT ASPECT OF THE

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.907
SOLAR INDUSTRY WHICH IS --

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.442
YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT ALONE

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:34.743
THE NUMBERS I THINK THIRTY THREE

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.978
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PEOPLE ARE

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.546
WORKING IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY IN

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.714
SOME CAPACITY OR ANOTHER.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.282
AND THAT'S DIRECTLY IN THE SOLAR

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.917
INDUSTRY NOT TO MENTION.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.552
THE FOLKS AT NAY COMMON SERVICE

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:44.420
SAID OR TO OTHER.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.088
GO ANCILLARY THANKS SO.

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:49.125

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.695
I BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.529
MAYBE WE CAN TALK OFF LINE YOU

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.731
CAN EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE COST

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.432
PIECE IS GOING TO BE ADDRESS

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.667
BECAUSE IF IT'S THIRTY THOUSAND

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.169
DOLLARS OR SOMETHING.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:02.338
STOLEN ARRAY AND THAT COVERS A

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.607
100% YOUR HOUSEHOLD NEEDS AND

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:05.808
THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.976
IMES MAKING NUMBERS UP IS NUMBER

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.878
FIVE THOUSAND TO PUT.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.045
STORAGE UNIT THERE WELL.

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.680
WHY ARE YOU GONNA SPEND THIRTY

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.516
FIVE IF YOU CAN SPEND?

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.817
THIRTY AND IN A SUBSIDY

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:15.384
CERTAINLY CAN PLAY A ROLE I

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:16.752
THINK CAN.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.087
INDUCING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.955
AMONG CUSTOMERS --

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:22.157
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE --

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.659
A BIT OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:24.159
THE GROWTH POTENTIAL THE

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:26.128
INDUSTRY.

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.163
THAT JUST OF A QUICK RESPONSE

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.064
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:29.431
THAT.

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:30.833
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN THE

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.201
PC ISSUED ITS NAME TO POINT OUR

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.903
DECISION.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:34.637
THAT --

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.805
IMPLEMENTING AB THREE TWENTY

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:37.973
SEVEN THE THE NEW NAME TARIFF IF

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.276
REQUIRED.

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.077
CUSTOMERS WANTING DINNER CONNECT

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.412
UNDER THEM TARA TO BE ON A TIME

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.680
OF USE RATE SO WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.749
INCREASINGLY AS THE TIME OF USE

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:47.616
RATES ARE AS THE PEAKS ARE

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.918
SHIFTED BACK.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.085
THOSE MIDDAY PRICES ARE PRETTY

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.186
LOW.

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.821
AND SO IT'S OFTEN A CUSTOMER'S

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.423
BENEFIT TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.325
SOLAR NOT EXPORTED BECAUSE THEY

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.294
ONLY GET CREDITED AT THE RATE IN

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:58.861
EFFECT DURING THAT TWO WEEK

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.162
PERIOD.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:01.864
SO THAT SO IT'S ALSO A QUESTION

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:02.865
OF HOW MUCH IS THE POWER WORTH

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.633
WHEN IT IS EXPORTED TO THE GRID.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.968
SO YOU WANT TO SAVE IT AND THEN

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:06.869
USE IT DURING THOSE [inaudible]

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.871
PEAK HOURS.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:09.638
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:12.875
THE INTEREST IN STORAGE.

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.577
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.979

AND FOR MR CUNNINGHAM --

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.417
SO I BOUGHT BATTERIES AND THE

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.686
OTHER TWO THINGS ONE IS --

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:26.322
WE WON'T HAVE NAM RATES FOR EVER.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:29.024
AND SO I WAS AS USUAL I WANT TO

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:30.259
GET OUT AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.527
A BIT BEYOND THAT BY HAVING

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.796
BATTERIES SHOULD THERE BE A

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.698
POWER FAILURE FOR EARTHQUAKE

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:38.834
WHATEVER REASON YOU'VE GOT POWER --

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.102
FOR A GOOD PERIOD OF TIME A FEW

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.737
DAYS.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:42.638
UNTIL HOPEFULLY POWER IS

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.073
RESTORED TO THE SEVERAL REASONS

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:45.941
TO GET THEM AND I WAS.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.541
AND EVERYONE OF THOSE YEARS BEEN

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:47.576
INVOLVED AND GENERATE CASES

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.244
BEFORE THE COMMISSION.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:50.879
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THOSE

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:54.282
RATE CASES SAFETY RELIABILITY

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:54.849
GETS VERY LITTLE ATTENTION.

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.184
IT'S A BY PRODUCT OF HAGGLING

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:59.454
OVER MONEY IT IS NOT THE FOCUS.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.722
THAT PROCESS HAVE TO CHECK HAS

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.557
TO CHANGE IF WE WANT --

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.893
A SAFER CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.761
WOULD MAKE THAT CHANGE.

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.997
THE BILL HAS A TWO STEP PROCESS.

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.466
FIRST EVERY OTHER YEAR UTILITIES

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:12.567
WOULD FILE SAFETY RELIABILITY

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.869
PLANTS.

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:15.770
WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ALL OF THEIR

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:18.173
PROPOSALS --

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.140
FOR MAINTAINING SAFETY

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.375
RELIABILITY AND ALL OF THE COSTS

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:22.077
FOR DOING THAT.

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.445
YOU'LL BE A PUBLIC PROCESS OF

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.046
NOT BE IT APPEARS SEE INSIDER

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:27.015
GAME WOULD BE A PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.950
WITH FULL COMPLETE HEARINGS

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.452
EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS BRIEFINGS

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:33.321
ARGUMENTS THE WHOLE WORKS.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.322
IF YOU SEE WOULD EVALUATE THE

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.690
PLANS WOULD REVISE THE PLANS IF

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:36.958
NEEDED.

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.127
AND I WOULD CONSIDER THE COSTS --

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:40.562
THAT IT WANTS TO ALLOCATE TO

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.563
THOSE PLANS AND APPROVE THOSE

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.732
COST IT IS NOT A BLANK CHECK.

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:44.733
THE PC HAS TO APPROVE EVERY

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.468
NICKEL.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.003
AND IT WOULD APPROVE THEM ONLY

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.472
OF THOSE COSTS ARE REASONABLE.

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.040
IN PARTICULAR SENATOR DODD NOTED

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.408
IT WOULD PROHIBIT THE UTILITIES

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.377
FROM DIVERTING ANY OF THAT MONEY

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:56.578
TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.047
SAFETY RELIABILITY PLAN.

01:21:59.114 --> 01:21:59.981
THE SECOND STEP IS REALLY

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:00.849
IMPORTANT TO IT'S THE

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:02.350
ACCOUNTABILITY STEP [inaudible]

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.052
EVERY YEAR.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.253
THE COMMISSION WILL REVIEW WITH

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.254
THE UTILITY COMPLIED WITH ITS

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.856
PLAN.

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.224
IF YES IT WAS THAT WOULD FIND

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.759
WAS PRUDENT IF NO THE UTILITY

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:13.428
WILL GET FINED.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:14.529
NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO CLAIM THE

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.164
BILL THE BILL WOULD SOMEHOW

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:17.899
PROTECT THE UTILITY FROM

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.868
DISALLOWANCE IS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.102
ON THE CONTRARY THAT BUILT

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:23.305
SUBJECTS THE UTILITIES TO FIND

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.906
EVERY EAR IF IT FAILS TO FOLLOW

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.508
ITS APPROVED PLANT.

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:27.542
IT'S MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:31.646
THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW --

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.615
MY COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON THE

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:34.516
CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IN THE

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.750
ANALYSIS [inaudible]

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:40.221
ABOUT -- THE

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.724
IMPACTS ON RATE PAYERS.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:43.992
FIRST -- AND

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.293
YOU CAN LOOK ON PAGE FOURTEEN

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.362
LINES FOUR THROUGH.

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.531
SIX THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED.

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:52.167
TO EXAMINE THE FACTUAL.

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.001
AND THAT TO DO A FACTUAL

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:55.870
ANALYSIS OF ANY MAJOR EVENTS.

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:56.471
THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PAST

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:57.706
YEAR.

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.040
SO IS NOT A BLANK CHECK BILL BE

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.275
CLOSE RUBIO.

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.311
AND SECOND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:03.611
[inaudible]

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.146
THE COMMISSION.

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.015

COST IMPOSE AND RATE PAYERS ARE

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.652
JUST AND REASONABLE.

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.153
IN THE SENATE AMENDMENTS WERE

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.657

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.602
SORT OF MASSIVE RATING CREASES

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.037
PROPOSED AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:04.238
BILL.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.373
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE HUGE COST

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:07.975
IMPLICATIONS ON BUSINESSES AND

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.643
RICK RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS IN

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.345
THE STATE AND WE'RE VERY VERY

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.080
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.682
I WANT TO POINT TO WHAT I

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.851
THOUGHT WAS A VERY GOOD ANALYSIS

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:17.451
THAT WAS DONE BY THE COMMITTEE

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:19.620
CONSULTANT ITEM SIX IN THAT

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.622
ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES ONE OF THE

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:23.190
OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE.

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.892
WHICH IS THE END RUN POTENTIALLY

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.294
ON LIABILITY ISSUES WE DISAGREE

01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:28.462
THAT THIS WON'T HAVE SOME

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:30.297
IMPLICATIONS AS IT RELATES TO

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:31.766
WHO PAYS.

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:32.933
WE BELIEVE IT DOES HAVE SOME

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.802
VERY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS THAT

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.337
NEED FURTHER EXAMINATION AND

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.738
THEN FINALLY LET ME JUST MAKE

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:38.539
THE POINT.

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:39.640
THE UTILITIESHAVE A VERY

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.609
PERVERSE INCENTIVE TODAY THE

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.044
MORE THEY INVEST THE MORE MONEY

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:44.712
THEY MAKE.

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:45.846
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GUARANTEED

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.748
RATE OF RETURN AND SO IF THEY

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:48.816
CAN SHIFT ALL THESE COSTS ON TO

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:50.851
CONSUMERS. TO REDUCE THEIR

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.853
LIABILITY THERE'S NO CHECK ON

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.988
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:55.790
SHUT HIS MUCH UNDER RATEPAYERS.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.958
AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE IT

01:34:58.025 --> 01:34:59.727
REDUCES THEIR LIABILITY AND ON

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:00.995
TOP OF THAT TO GET THERE AND A

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.997
BIG FAT RATE OF RETURN ON TOP OF

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.131
EVERY DIME THEY INVEST SO

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:05.633
THERE'S NO INCENTIVE.

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:06.667
AT ALL FOR THEM TO KEEP THESE

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:09.236
COSTA.

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:10.404
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:11.439
BRISBANE JANA BATH OF KLAY CAN

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:12.740
CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.941
CONSUMERS --

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.010
REPRESENTING STEEL CEMENT A

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:17.878
BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES PIPELINE

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:18.846
IN WAR.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:22.316
OUT AGAIN THE ANALYSIS IS IT'S

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.717
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL DONE IN THE

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.453
TIME CONSTRAINTS THE COMPLEXITY.

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:28.022
AND I THINK THE THE GOALS OF

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:30.091
THAT MISTER DODD IS IS TRYING TO

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:30.724
ACHIEVE IT I THINK ARE CERTAINLY

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:31.692
LAUDABLE.

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.861
AND AND WE AGREE SOMETHING NEEDS

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:35.729
TO BE DONE WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.265
THE THE STATEMENT THAT NOTHING'S

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.633
BEING DONE OR SOMETHING NEEDS TO

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.302
BE DONE THAT'S NEW --

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:42.403
THE S. MAP.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.338
AND I AND THE RAMP WHICH TAKE

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.906
PLACE IN GENERAL RATE CASES SO

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.108
THAT'S THE RISK ASSESSMENT

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.976
MITIGATION PHASE IN THE PAST

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.844
SAFETY MODELING ASSESSMENT

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.245
PROCEEDING IT TAKES PLACE IN THE

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:52.313
GENERATORS.

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.180
HOW HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.683
EVIDENCE AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:57.184
PARTICIPATION BY INTERESTED

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.019
STAKEHOLDERS THIS COMPRESSED

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.821
UNREALISTIC EIGHTEEN MONTH TIME

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:01.522
FRAME?

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.124
WILL NOT ALLOW FOR THAT SAME

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.658
LEVEL OF SCRUTINY.

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:05.893
AND WHAT THE UTILITIES BRING

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.394
THEIR RESOURCES COMPARED TO WHAT

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.163
WE CANNOT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.831
THE TABLE WE GET WHEN WE GET RUN

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.066
OVER WE DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:14.168
RESOURCES. TO FIGHT AT THE SAME

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:15.236
LEVEL WITH THE UTILITIES CAN

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.604
BRING TO THIS THIS IS WHAT THEY

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:17.705
DO FOR A LIVING.

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:18.906
RIGHT OR JUST TRYING TO KEEP OUR

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:20.241
RATES DOWN SO WE CAN KEEP JOBS

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.509
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:25.312
SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:27.848
THANK YOU APARTMENT OTHER

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:29.583
UNCERTAIN IF YOU KNOW WHAT BUT

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:30.351
THE MISTER CHAIRMAN --

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:31.185
MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.186
SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.021
TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I AGREE

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:34.855
WITH YOU KNOW ALL THE COMMENTS

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:35.956
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PREVIOUSLY --

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:40.661
IN IN OPPOSITION S. B. TENNEY

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:41.695
WORDS OR ASK EVERYONE TO KNOW.

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:43.597
INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICITY RATES ARE

01:36:43.664 --> 01:36:44.798
86% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:47.434
WERE WILL ALSO WELL ABOVE TWICE

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.436
IN SOME CASES ABOVE THE AVERAGE

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:50.771
OR ABOVE THE RATES.

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.373
IN OUR NEIGHBORING STATES SO AS

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:53.874
FAR AS COMPETITIVENESS GOES.

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:55.409
THE IMPACTS TO INDUSTRIAL

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.178
ELECTRICAL LITERACY RATES AS

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.846
WELL AS RESIDENTS RATES BUT IT

01:36:58.913 --> 01:36:59.647
REALLY DOES RAISE SOME

01:36:59.713 --> 01:37:00.247
PARTICULAR.

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:01.515
YOU KNOW HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.284
IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.451
JOBS MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS A

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:05.619
CALIFORNIA.

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.420
AND THAT'S SHOWING IN THOUGH THE

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:08.856
LAGGING INVESTMENT CREATION

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:11.926
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING SECTOR --

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:12.493
RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.761
COUNTRY.

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:15.396
NOT THE LAST POINT OUT I WANTED

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:16.997
TO NOTE IS IN ADDITION TO THAT.

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:18.532
IS THAT IS THE PROCESS ISSUE I

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.100
THINK MR BOCA DORA MENTION THIS

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:20.834
BRIEFLY.

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.503
BUT THE GENERAL RATE CASE

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.104
PROCEEDING LOOKS AT THAT ALL OF

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.940
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.541
GENERATION.

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.343
A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.744
OF ELECTRICITY LOOKS AT THE

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.746
SAFETY OR RELIABILITY OF THE

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:33.814
SYSTEM OF THE TO THE RESILIENCE

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:35.082
HE'S LOOKING AT DIFFERENT.

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.084
ASPECTS OF AND LOOKING AT ALL

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:37.918
THOSE COSTS TOGETHER.

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:39.787
THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:41.522
SEGMENTING OUT ALL OF THAT --

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:43.090
THAT THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.792
SHE RELATED TO WILDFIRES AND

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.794
OTHER DISASTERS AND AND SAFETY

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.495
OPERATIONS AS WELL.

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.397
NOW IS THE FACT THAT IT TAKES

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:52.166
ALL OF THE FOCUS AND PUTS IT ON

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:53.367
THAT AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:55.035
VERY DIFFICULT FOR A POLITICAL

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.437
APPOINTEE ON THE COMMISSION TO

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:58.005
MAKE A DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT.

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.506
WHATEVER'S BEFORE THEN BECAUSE

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:00.774
IT IS DEEMED TO BE THIS IS WHAT

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:01.875
IS THIS IS WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:03.244
SAFETY.

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:04.812
SUBDIVIDED FICKLE DECISION TO

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.280
MAKE I THINK IT IN IN A PER

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:07.881
INDIVIDUAL IN THAT POSITION.

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.717
I IN ADDITION TO THAT IT BECAUSE

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.352
IT TAKES ALL OF FOLK THE CONTEXT

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:13.554
OFF OF THE REST THAT --

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:14.655
ALL THE OTHER ISSUES RAISED

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.423
REALLY TO THAT BECOMES VERY EASY

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.792
TO SAY WELL THAT SOUNDS THAT

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:19.393
SOUNDS APPROPRIATE THAT SOUNDS

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.028
REASONABLE WILL THOSE COSTS ARE

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:21.962
GOING TO GET FED INTO THE

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.264
GENERAL RATE CASE.

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.498
AND WHAT HISTORICALLY WHAT WE

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.267
HAVE SEEN IS THAT INDUSTRIAL

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:29.069
RATEPAYERS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE --

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.971
DID TAKING YOU KNOW INCREASINGLY.

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.039
NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AS

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.174
RESULT OF THE WAY THE P. YOU SEE

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:36.176
IS HANDLED AS WELL SO WE DO HAVE

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:37.344
CONCERNS YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.612
PROCESS.

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:40.114
THE IMPACTS OF THIS IT CERTAINLY

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.115
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:42.349
IN DESERVES --

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:44.385
DO ATTENTION AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.420
IS IS BEING BROUGHT IN A NUMBER

FIRES FROM LAST YEAR AND

CERTAINLY IN YEARS PAST AND WHAT

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:07.180
THAT.

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:07.881
MEANS AND HOW SAFETY IS

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.984
PARAMOUNT STATION --

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.419
WE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE BILL AND

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.454
FIND A WAY TO CARVE OUT A SAFETY

01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:16.156
BILL --

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:18.125
THERE ARE ELEMENTS TO THIS THAT

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.627
REQUIRED QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.329
DETAILED --

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:24.765
REVIEW OF THE WE DIDN'T GO AS

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:26.500
DEEPLY IN SOME AREAS THAT WE

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.802
PROBABLY COULD HAVE BECAUSE WE

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:29.736
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:30.504
HIGHLIGHT.

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:32.306
AND TO PRESERVE THE SAFETY

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:35.309
ELEMENTS OF THE BILL CLEARLY --

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.910
THE P. YOU SEE THERE MAY BE

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:39.279
ELEMENTS OF YOUR BILL THAT --

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.114
COMPLEMENT THEIR PROCESS BUT IT

01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:42.783
COULD BE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:45.218
THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE PROCESS --

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.187
WE ARE NOT CLEAR JUST YET ON

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.056
WHAT THOSE REPRESENT AND HOW

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:50.390
THEY WOULD BE RECEIVED AND HOW

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:51.758
THEY WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:51.992
THE CPU.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.660
UC'S.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.362
OUR PROCESS AND REVIEW.

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:57.864
THE OTHER PART IF I COULD --

01:43:57.931 --> 01:43:59.600
JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:01.401
ALSO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:03.604
THE GENERAL RATE CASE --

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:05.639
PROCESS AND HOW THIS IS OUTSIDE

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.541
OR DEVIATES FROM THAT EXISTING

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.176
PROCESS AND THAT DOES CAUSE SOME

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:11.044
CONCERNS --

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.546
BUT HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:14.648
THOSE ELEMENTS WE WERE PREPARED

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.984
TO MOVE FORWARD ON BUT THE PART

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:18.619
THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:44:18.685 --> 01:44:19.720
IS THE ELEMENT THAT DEALS WITH

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.188
AN ITEM.

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.689
SIX THE RATE PAYER VULNERABILITY

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:24.324
AND WHAT THAT COULD ULTIMATELY

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:25.926
MEAN AND HOW IT COULD BE

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.561
ULTIMATELY INTERPRETED AND AS

01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:28.428
YOU KNOW --

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.330
AT LEAST IN THIS HOUSE THIS YEAR

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.132
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:33.700
LOOK AT FIRE LIABILITY.

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:36.370
AND HOW TO PROPOSE SOME TYPE OF

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:38.171
A SOLUTION A CERTAINLY IN THE

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:39.406
WORKING GROUP THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:41.041
AFFILIATED WITH.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.176
THERE HAS BEEN NO CONSENSUS ARE

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:44.711
THERE ARE STILL.

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.513
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW YOUR BILL

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.215
COULD BE --

01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:49.383
THAT ISSUE COULD STILL BE

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:51.918
IMPACTED AND FIND ITS WAY INTO

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.353
THIS PROCESS AND WE THANK.

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.589
AT LEAST THE RECOMMENDATION IS

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:57.724
TO STRIKE THE ITEM.

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:58.792
SIX HOW WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE US

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:00.894
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:01.695
REVIEW.

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:05.532
OF THE LARGER ISSUES AROUND --

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:06.900
SPREADING COSTS AMONGST

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:09.603
RATEPAYERS AND HOW THAT MIGHT BE

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:12.039
ADDRESSED AND A AND A

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.974
COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND AND FAIR

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.742
AND EQUITABLE WAY --

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:17.911
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS THE THE

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.546
HEART SOUL OF WHY WE MADE THE

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:21.181
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE DID.

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:22.916
AND SO I'M --

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:23.316
I KNOW THAT IT'S A

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.752
RECOMMENDATION.

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.421
CORD BUT I HAS YOU SHARED IT

WITH ME I'LL GIVE YOU THE

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:29.222
OPPORTUNITY THIS A WHERE THEY'RE

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:30.457
NOT YOU.

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:31.124
YOU --

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.426
CONTINUE TO HOLD ON TO THAT

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:36.930
POSITION BUT IT'S MY HOPE THAT.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:37.864
YOU KNOW.

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.599
AND UPON REFLECTION AND ON WHAT

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.767
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE WITH

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:42.502
YOU TODAY THAT --

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:44.004
YOU WOULD --

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:47.607
EXCEPT THE THE RECOMMENDATION TO

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.543
THE LEAD ITEM SIX TO MOVE

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.878
FORWARD WITH THE BILL AS AS

01:45:51.945 --> 01:45:53.480
STATED IN PRATT --

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.015
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF IMPORTANT

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:57.217
COMPONENTS IN HERE FROM A SAFETY

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:59.086
PERSPECTIVE DE ENERGIZING

01:45:59.152 --> 01:46:00.120
CONCEPTS IN A LOT OF OTHER

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:01.588
THINGS AND STRATEGIES THAT I

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:02.589
THINK.

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:06.059
DESERVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:06.960
AGAIN.

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:09.096
MAKING IT ABOUT SAFETY AND THAT

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:10.731
WAS OUR INTENT TO SORT OF PUT

01:46:10.797 --> 01:46:11.998
THE FOCUS IN THAT AREA.

01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:15.135
AND SO I I LAY THAT BEFORE YOU

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.570
AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE --

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:18.739
THAT THE COMMITTEE IS PREPARED

01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:20.173
MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.909
SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND MOVE YOUR

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:25.045
BILL ALONG WITH THE AMENDMENT

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:27.447

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.705
EASY THING TO DO FOR NOT RIGHT

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:53.340
NOW FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:54.241

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.414
CERTAINLY.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:36.583
THE SAME AMOUNT OF A

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:37.951
CONSTITUENTS IT SENATORS AND

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.586
MAYBE TWICE AS MANY AS ASSEMBLY

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:40.854
MEMBER SO.

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:43.423
I AM NOT LOOKING FOR SITUATION

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.658
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:45.292
THE RATES AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:48.094
GO HOME. TO MY DISTRICT AND WE

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.096
HAVE JUST DONE NOTHING BUT

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:52.032
INCREASED RATES ON MANY FACTORS

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:54.000
INCREASE RATES ON ON HOMER'S

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:55.168
NOTHING.

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.670
COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.505
BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A FEAR OF

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:00.073
THAT.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.341
ALL THE SUDDEN THERE'S A

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.143
DIALOGUE AROUND.

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.812
NOT DOING ANYTHING NOT MOVING

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:07.180
FORWARD.

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:10.116

SOLUTION I ALSO --

01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:23.964
BELIEVE THAT --

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.032
THIS GOES TO THE G. O. COMMITTEE

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:27.400
AND THEN IT GOES TO APPROACH

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.302
AFTER SESSION I BELIEVE WE HAVE

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:30.737

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:32.172

01:49:09.442 --> 01:49:12.245
TOUGH CHOICES SO THAT WE CAN

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:12.846
FIND OUT WHAT IT'S GONNA BE IN

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.080
MAYBE.

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.282
MAYBE IT'S AN OFF RAMP LIKE THE

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.117
GOVERNOR HAD ON THEM HAD STILL

01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:19.686
ON THE MINIMUM WAGE --

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:21.254
MAYBE THERE'S AN OFF RAMP IF

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:22.856
WHEN HE GETS THE CPUC UP I'VE

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.758
GOT SOME IDEAS ON THAT BOBBY

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:25.959
WORKING HAVE TALKED ASSEMBLY

APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR AND

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:38.238
HOW.

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:39.806
SO WITH THAT MY OF MY

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:42.142
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE. TO ARE

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.177
ALLOWED TO CARVE THAT PIECE OUT

01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:46.079
AND ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:48.248
HAPPEN THROUGH OF LEADERSHIP IN

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.916
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PROVIDING

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:50.951
THAT LEADERSHIP AND I DO BELIEVE

01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:51.651
THAT.

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:52.852
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUR ARMS

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.287
AROUND THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE END

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:56.156
OF SESSION BUT IF IT'S LEFT AND

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.624

THIS RIGHT NOW IS.

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:08.335
GIVEN THE TIME I BELIEVE THAT IF

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:10.070
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:50:10.136 --> 01:50:11.438
LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:12.572
THE SENATE.

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:14.407
HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF GOING.

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:15.675
THIS IS GOING TO BE MET A QUICK

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:17.911
DEATH IN APPROPRIATIONS.

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:19.512
ALMOST CERTAINLY IF IT DOESN'T

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:21.281
THERE AND THE GOVERNOR'S GOT ITS

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:22.916
OWN WAY OF DOING IT HE'LL BE

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:25.051
ABLE -- TO

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.820
YOU KNOW REJECT THE BILL.

BUT FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING.

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:39.532
TO TALK TO THE BILL WITHOUT THE

01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:41.568
CHAIRS AMENDMENT.

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.403
I SUPPORT THE BILL WITHOUT THE

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.871
CHAIRS AMENDMENT --

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:45.972
DISOBEY THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR

I HAVEN'T SPORTED THE CHAIR AND

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.808
I HOPE IT'S THE LAST.

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:51.911
BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THAT --

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:53.279
THE PART OF THE BILL THE CHAIR

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:53.980
ONCE TAKEN THAT WAS VERY

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:55.949
IMPORTANT LET ME ADDRESS A FEW

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:56.950
OTHER THINGS FIRST.

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.251
ARM WITH THE CHAIRS OUR

01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:00.253
PERMISSION.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.922
UP WE HEARD FROM TWELVE FORTY

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:03.790
FIVE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTING

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:05.325
THE BILL AS WRITTEN MEANING

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:07.394
WITHOUT YOUR AMENDMENT. FOR THE

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.696
PEOPLE WHO CAME UP IN SUPPORT.

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:11.664
WE DON'T KNOW.

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:13.633
WHETHER THEY WERE SUPPORTING IT

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:17.137
WITH YOUR AMENDMENT OR WITHOUT --

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:18.738
IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN FIND

01:51:18.805 --> 01:51:20.407
OUT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.308
SUPPORT PERHAPS BY A RAISE OF

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:23.977
HANDS WEB THAT WHICH WAY THEY

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:26.346
WERE SUPPORTING THE BILL WITH

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:28.048
THEIR WITHOUT YOUR AMENDMENT

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:28.348
[inaudible]

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:32.552
BECAUSE THE OKAY SO WELL ASSUME

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:34.154
UNLESS PEOPLE SHOUT OUT

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.388
DIFFERENTLY THAT THIS WAS

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:37.524
SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITHOUT THE

01:51:37.590 --> 01:51:39.893
CHAIRS AMENDMENT.

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:40.994
ALL RIGHT --

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.495
FIRST OF ALL A INDUSTRIAL

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:45.231
RATEPAYERS DO PAY TOO MUCH AND

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:46.366
LARGE ENERGY USE USED TO PAY TOO

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:47.734
MUCH.

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:48.968
I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE THING

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.770
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT BUT I DON'T

01:51:50.837 --> 01:51:52.172
THINK THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:53.973
VEHICLE FOR IT.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.009
I WOULD BE GLAD AND WORKING WITH

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.811
OTHERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

01:51:58.078 --> 01:51:59.612
AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:00.880
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.582
THE RIGHT WAY TO ADDRESS IT BUT

01:52:02.649 --> 01:52:04.017
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:06.419
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:08.621
OKAY SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:11.458
AND I'VE BEEN ON BOTH --

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:13.893
AUTUMN BARRACKS --

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.362
BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE I'VE BEEN

01:52:16.429 --> 01:52:17.630
ON THE CHAIRS --

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.666
COMMITTEE AND WE'VE HEARD FROM A

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.634
LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHAT WE KEEP

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.304
ON HEARING.

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:26.806
IS YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:28.108
THINGS AREN'T --

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:30.143
SAFE ENOUGH.

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.812
RPG AND THE THERE CULPABLE THEY

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:34.647
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH THIS IS WHAT

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:36.549
I'M HEARING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:52:36.616 --> 01:52:38.318
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE

01:52:38.384 --> 01:52:39.919
THINK THE MONEY IS COMING FROM

01:52:39.986 --> 01:52:41.254
BUT IN THE END IT COMES FROM

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:43.389
RATE PAYERS WATER P. G.'S IN AS

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.825
IT ASSETS RIGHT NOW WELL.

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.293
LET'S SEE NOW IT CAN'T GET

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.496
INSURANCE ANYMORE WITHOUT PAYING

01:52:49.562 --> 01:52:52.065
SOMETHING LIKE 33% A YEAR FOR

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:54.534
WHAT THEY UPDATE YET --

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:56.336
WELL THEY HAVE A RETAIL BUSINESS

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:57.737
BUT THAT'S ALL GOING TO THE

01:52:57.804 --> 01:52:59.772
CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:52:59.839 --> 01:53:00.807
AGGREGATORS.

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:02.709
ó THEY HAVE LINES BUT IF YOU

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:04.844
BUY THE LINES YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:07.680
SUBJECT TO WELCOME --

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:08.982
V. --

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.717
INVERSE CONDEMNATION YOU

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:12.418
BASICALLY BECOME THE FIRE ENSURE

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:14.020
FOR THE STATE SURE THEY HAVE

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.622
ASSETS NONE OF WHICH YOU WERE

01:53:15.688 --> 01:53:17.157
UNFORTUNATELY WORTH VERY MUCH AT

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.224
THIS POINT.

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:19.425
AND THE BOND RATING IS IN THE

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:21.995
TOILET SO THEY CAN'T TAKE BONDS.

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:22.996
THIS MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:24.764
COME FROM RATEPAYERS THERE IS NO

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.299
OTHER WAY TO GET IT AND THAT

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:28.501
DOES MEAN RATES WILL GO UP --

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.836
ALREADY WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:30.837
AUTHOR THAT HE'S WILLING TO LOOK

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:33.740
AT OFF RAMPS --

01:53:33.806 --> 01:53:36.576
THE SECOND THING I WANT.

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:37.977
TO POINT OUT IS THAT.

01:53:38.044 --> 01:53:39.579
OUR PEOPLE SAY WE SHOULD KEEP

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:41.548
WITH THE OLD PROCESS.

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:43.283
WELL THERE'S A PROVEN CROSS

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:44.584
SECTION.

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:47.153
COST SAVING IT'S IN THE FINDING

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:48.788
CHAIR IN THE BILL.

01:53:48.855 --> 01:53:50.790
I'M THAT YOU GET A LARGE COST

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:52.492
SAVING.

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.827
BY IMPROVING THE SYSTEM AND NOT

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:56.963
ALLOWING FIRES.

01:53:57.030 --> 01:54:01.167
P. YOU SEE HASN'T DONE THAT --

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:03.603
AS SOMEONE ELSE SAID V. --

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.138
ENERGY COMPANIES ASK FOR A LOT

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:06.906
OF MONEY.

01:54:06.973 --> 01:54:08.508
OB THEY WANNA FOR EXAMPLE

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:10.376
APPROVE IMPROVE THE SITUATION

01:54:10.443 --> 01:54:14.080
AROUND THE NATURAL GAS.

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:15.915
OF FACILITIES AND IMPROVE THE

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:18.117
SAFETY SO WE DON'T GET THE

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.852
SMELLY GAS AROUND SOUTHERN

01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:21.588
CALIFORNIA.

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.056
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY FOR THAT

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:25.225
AND UTILITIES DON'T REALLY HAVE

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:27.493
LARGE ASSETS THAT THEY COULD PAY

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.861
FOR IT THEMSELVES IT HAS TO COME

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.530
FROM RATEPAYERS.

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.298
SO YEAH WE'RE GONNA TO COME FROM

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:34.767
RATEPAYERS.

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:35.902
THE FINAL THING I WANT TO

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.704
ADDRESS IS THE AMENDMENT THAT

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:39.572
THE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT.

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:41.107
NO MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:43.042
WRITE THIS BUT RIGHT NOW

01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:46.412
UTILITIES HAVE NO GUIDELINES.

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.314
WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:49.983
OF THE P. YOU SEE?

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:51.851
ABOUT THE PROCEEDINGS WHILE AND

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:53.353
I ASKED HIM I SAID DOES THIS

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:54.621
MEAN IN THE PROCEEDINGS ARE

01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:55.388
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

01:54:55.455 --> 01:54:57.323
HE SAID YES [inaudible]

01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:59.158
ALRIGHT.

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.493
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.461
BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NEVER BE

01:55:01.527 --> 01:55:03.062
FOUND INNOCENT.

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:04.964
ARE IN THE CASE OF THE SOUTHERN

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:06.599
CALIFORNIA GAS OF CHEESE ME

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:07.467
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:55:07.533 --> 01:55:09.769
ELECTRIC.

01:55:09.836 --> 01:55:11.938
THERE WAS AN OPERATOR ON THE

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.072
LINES WITH MANY YEARS OF

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:14.907
EXPERIENCE WHO DECIDED NOT TO DE

01:55:14.974 --> 01:55:16.976
ENERGIZE A LINE.

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:20.013
COMMISSIONERS VOTED FIVE ZERO

01:55:20.079 --> 01:55:21.614
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DE ENERGIZE

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:22.849
THE LINE TO SEE IF THEY KNEW

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:24.417
WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE TALKING

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:26.252
ABOUT AND AGAIN I'VE HEARD FOR

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:26.953
THE COMMISSION IS THAT THEY

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:27.820
DON'T KNOW.

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.289
WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD HAVE DE

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.224
ENERGIZED THE LINE BUT THAT'S

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:32.925
WHAT THE PRECEDING SAID THERE

01:55:32.992 --> 01:55:34.594
ARE NO STANDARDS.

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.596
NOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:38.798
ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.700
EXACT RIGHT STANDARD --

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.602
WE CAN WE CAN FIDDLE WITH SOME

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:43.903
OF THE WORDING BUT THERE HAS TO

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.738
BE A STANDARD.

01:55:45.805 --> 01:55:47.774
I CAN'T JUST SAY O. P. GENIE I

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.375
KNOW YOU TRIM THE MILLION AND A

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:51.110
HALF TREES BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:54.347
TRIMMED A MILLION AND A HALF AND

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:55.581
THREE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:57.183
CHARGE YOU TEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.484
WHICH BY THE WAY.

01:55:58.551 --> 01:56:00.320
P. GENIE DOESN'T HAVE.

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:02.255
THEMOST LIKELY --

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:05.358
SCENARIO IS IF WE GO AHEAD WITH

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:07.293
THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WE

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.562
FIND THE AND THIS BILL HAS BY

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:11.397
THE WAY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:13.833
LAST FIRE THIS IS GOING AHEAD.

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.268
THE MOST LIKELY THING IS P.

01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:16.703
JEANNIE GOES BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:18.671
GOOD FOR PGM EIGHT LOOK AT HOW

01:56:18.738 --> 01:56:19.906
WELL THEY DID THE LAST TIME.

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:21.674
BUT ALSO LOOK LOOK WHAT HAPPENED

01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:22.208
TO THE WORKERS IN THE RATE

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.443
PAYERS.

01:56:23.509 --> 01:56:25.278
LAST TIME WHEN THEY WENT WE ARE

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:27.547
STILL PAYING A LARGE BILL

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:29.882
BECAUSE P. JEANNIE WENT BANKRUPT.

01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:32.185
WE ARE STILL PAYING A LARGE BILL

01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.720
BECAUSE THE STATE TOOK OVER FROM

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:35.388
THE ENERGY COMPANIES WHEN THEY

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:37.023
COULDN'T BUY POWER ANYMORE.

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:40.026
AND THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:41.627
SO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP A

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:45.164
STANDARD --

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:46.833
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:49.769
TO HAVE THAT STANDARD --

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:52.605
SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT POLICY

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.807
WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:57.677
NEED TO DO BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:00.546
IF THERE IS NO STANDARD.

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:02.749
FAT AND THIRD YEARS YES BEING

01:57:02.815 --> 01:57:03.850
WHAT IT IS.

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:05.351
THEY SHOULD DO AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:07.019
HAPPENING NOW SO WHAT'S

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.855
HAPPENING NOW THAT SOME PEOPLE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:09.856
WANT TO CONTINUE HAPPENING WE

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.157
HAVE A PROCEEDING WHERE THE

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:14.494
MONEY DOESN'T GET ASIDE. FOR

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.095
WHERE THE MONEY IS TO PUT ASIDE

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:18.698
FOR SAFETY WE HAVE A WAY THAT

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:20.166
THE UTILITIES HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:22.568
IT IS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

01:57:22.635 --> 01:57:23.569
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:25.204
SYSTEM.

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:27.373
ALRIGHT I AM NOW GOING TO MOVE

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.409
THE BELL AS WRITTEN WITHOUT THE

01:57:29.475 --> 01:57:31.210
CHAIR WITH DUE RESPECT FOR THE

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:32.245
CHAIR OF THE HELP I CAN READ

01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:33.212
SUPPORT OF EVERY OTHER TIME THIS

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:34.480
YEAR.

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.182
BUT WITH THAT WITH DUE RESPECT

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:37.717
FOR THE CHAIR I SEE I MOVE THE

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:38.217
BILL WITHOUT THE CHAIRS

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:46.926
AMENDMENT.

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:49.095
I'LL TAKE TWO DIVERSIONS FROM MA --

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:51.564
MY MY FRIEND MISTER QUIRK I HAVE

01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:52.732
NOT ALWAYS AGREED WITH THE CHAIR

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:53.966
AND I WILL BE BRIEF [inaudible]

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:58.871
OF A BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:01.007
THE BILL TODAY AND IT SOUNDS

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:01.607
LIKE IT'S ALREADY BEEN WORKED

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.543
OUT THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE THE

01:58:03.609 --> 01:58:05.278
VOTES -- BUT

01:58:05.344 --> 01:58:06.612
I JUST WANT TO SAY.

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:07.713
I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.482
TIME I THINK WE NEED A GRANDER

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.116
PLAN.

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:11.350
RIGHT AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:12.819
TRYING TO DO IS A PIECE OF THAT

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.087
GRANDER PLAN BUT IT IS NOT

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:16.189
ENCOMPASSING ASSEMBLY WHO

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:17.890
REPRESENTS AN AREA THAT'S GONNA

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.125
BE HUNDRED EIGHT THIS WEEKEND.

01:58:19.192 --> 01:58:20.460
WE ALREADY HAVE EXTRAORDINARILY

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:24.163
COSTS OF ABOUT OF ENERGY

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:25.465
ASSEMBLY WHO REPRESENTS AN AREA

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:27.166
WHERE WE STILL PROCESS FOOD AND

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.902
WE HAVE A LOT OF BAG AND WE KNOW.

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:33.239
THAT OUR WE HAVE OUR OUR

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:34.941
AGRICULTURE ECONOMY HAS BEEN.

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:37.643
OUT OF HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE FOR

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:38.811
AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE AND

01:58:38.878 --> 01:58:41.714
AND BEFORE AND THIS IS GOING TO

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:44.083
CONTINUE --

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:46.018
DE THEN THE DOWNWARD.

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.154
PORTION ON IT --

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:50.823
AS FAR AS ENERGY RATES AND I

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:52.358
HAVE USED A AND I AND I WILL USE

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:53.693
THE SAME ANALOGY KEEP USING OF

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:55.027
CRAP BUT AS A SOCIAL WORKER.

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:58.030
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS.

01:58:58.097 --> 01:58:58.598
THE SUMMARY IS GONNA COMMIT

01:58:58.664 --> 01:58:58.865
SUICIDE.

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:00.967
I DO A SAFETY PLAN.

01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:02.435
I DISCIPLINE TO KEEP THEIR

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:03.836
PERSONAL LIFE THAT I THINK I

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:04.437
PRAYER WENT UP GOOD GOOD GOOD

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:05.304
GOOD.

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.607
THEY DO EVERYTHING I ASK.

01:59:07.673 --> 01:59:08.374
AND YET THE END THEY STILL END

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:09.475
UP [inaudible]

01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:12.445
FOLLOWING THROUGH.

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:14.247
WHEN WE PUT IN SAFETY PLANS THEY

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:16.649
ARE ONLY I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:59:16.716 --> 01:59:17.283
SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT IN THE

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:18.284
MOMENT?

01:59:18.351 --> 01:59:20.486
BUT AS FAR AS THE GRAND IMPACT

01:59:20.553 --> 01:59:22.488
OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:23.789
THERE'S NO PLANNING WE CAN DO

01:59:23.856 --> 01:59:25.858
ECONOMICALLY ADDRESS ALL OF THAT

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:26.692
WITHOUT.

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:28.761
OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED TO BE

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.897
ABLE TO MITIGATE.

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:33.165
THE PLANS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE.

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:34.267
WE ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE PLANT A

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.335
SEED CBB IT P. UC IS WORKING ON

01:59:36.402 --> 01:59:37.937
RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS PUTS A

IS THAT WE DON'T MOVE VERY

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:44.277

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:19.879
LEGISLATIVE SEASON IS OVER.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:34.460
LOT OF HARD WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:36.696
DOING UP TOGETHER --

02:00:36.762 --> 02:00:43.402
SECONDLY OF SOMETIMES I THINK WE

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.972
WE THINK WE KNOW SO MUCH FOR SO.

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:47.406
CERTAIN.

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:49.842
WHEN WE REALLY DON'T?

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:51.611
AND THAT'S WHY I'M.

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:52.712
A INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:54.580
AS WRITTEN [inaudible]

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:59.151
AND TAKE THE CHAIR PARA.

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:02.989
UP AND TO CHECK TAKE MR DOT UP --

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.824
ON THEIR COMMITMENTS AND

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.959
PROMISES TO WORK THROUGH THIS

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:08.527
WITH AN EYE TOWARD WHAT THIS

02:01:08.594 --> 02:01:10.663
DOES. TO RATE PAYERS

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:10.963
[inaudible]

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:16.469
AND THIRDLY.

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.604
WE ARE ACTUALLY HAVING THE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.640
BEGINNINGS OF THAT BIGGER.

02:01:20.706 --> 02:01:23.042
SURE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.809
AND I AM CONCERNED THAT THE

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:26.112
CLOCK IS TICKING.

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.380
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST DOING

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.448
SOMETHING.

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.984
BUT IT IS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:34.153
THAT WORKS DOING SOMETHING THAT

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.588
IS FAIR AND REASONABLE.

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:36.756
AND OING SOMETHING THAT'S

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:38.691
RESPONSIBLE.

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:40.626
AND I THINK THAT THE THAT MOTHER

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:42.428
NATURE AND THE WILDFIRES IN THE

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:44.230
PLACE WE ARE IN TODAY HAS DEALT

02:01:44.296 --> 02:01:45.965
US A HORRIBLE SET OF PLAYING

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.199
CARDS [inaudible]

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:49.268
AFFECTING EVERYBODY AND THE

02:01:49.335 --> 02:01:51.871
SUREST WAY FOR US. TO GET OUT

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:53.205
FROM UNDERNEATH THIS THERE'S

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:55.808
THIS HORRIBLE --

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:57.510
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS TO TRY

02:01:57.576 --> 02:01:59.578
EVERYTHING WE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE

02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:01.714
THESE RISKS DOWN.

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:03.616
BY MANAGING THE FORCE BETTER BY

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:04.850
SAFETY PLANTS THAT ARE COMING

02:02:04.917 --> 02:02:06.218
FORWARD BY HOLDING THE UTILITIES

02:02:06.285 --> 02:02:07.019
ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:07.319
[inaudible]

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.088
SAFETY PLANTS.

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:11.457
AND SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS --

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:12.058
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVE

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:14.393
FORWARD.

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:15.795
AND I ALSO --

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:17.396
DO WANT TO REITERATE THOUGH AND

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:19.165
AS I'VE MENTIONED TO US.

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:20.366
THE MANUFACTURERS AND TO

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.435
AGRICULTURE --

02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:24.570
RATES AND WHAT RATES ARE DOING

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:25.871
AT THE AGRICULTURE AND AND

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:27.707
MANUFACTURING IS IS --

02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:29.942
IT'S TERRIBLE.

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:31.911
AND YET IT IT IT HAS THE IT I

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:32.812
DON'T THINK IT IS RESIDENT IN

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:34.480
THIS BILL.

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.615
ON I THINK WHAT HAS CAUSED THE

02:02:36.682 --> 02:02:38.050
PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN POLICIES OF

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:39.218
COME OUT OF THIS PLACE ANOTHER

02:02:39.285 --> 02:02:41.153
BILLS AND OTHER --

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.822
EFFORTS THAT HAVE JUST BASICALLY

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.056
SAID YOU GOT THE DEEP POCKETS

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:44.657
WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:45.858
SHIFT THAT TO YOU.

02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:47.460
SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS I THINK

02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:50.396
THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD.

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:52.798
AND I HOPE THAT IT DEMONSTRATES

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:54.600
A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE BEYOND

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.001
JUST THE MEETINGS IN THE

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:57.703
DISCUSSIONS.

02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:59.338
AND TOWARD GETTING THE

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.840
ADMINISTRATION GETTING OUR

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.875
COMMIT WORKING GROUP GETTING

02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:04.443
THAT MEMBER BURKE WORKING GROUP

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:06.178
TOGETHER WORKING THROUGH TO GET

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:07.113
TO THESE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS

02:03:07.179 --> 02:03:07.413
[inaudible]

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.416
WE'D WE DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:10.716
[inaudible]

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:15.054
OF DECIDING ON SOMETHING PERFECT.

02:03:15.121 --> 02:03:16.021
BUT WE DO HAVE THEIR

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.256
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE A

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.691
DECISION ON SOMETHING THAT WILL

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.993
MOVE FORWARD OUR RESPONSIBILITY

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.229
AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. TO

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.530
DEAL WITH THE OVER ARCHING

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:25.664
PROBLEM OF WHAT'S GOING TO

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:26.966
HAPPEN WITH THESE FIRES.

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:29.401
AND I THINK THIS IS A A GOOD

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.369
DECENT STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.303
DIRECTION.

02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.038
BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT RATES

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:34.406
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE.

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:35.741
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MEN AS

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:37.777
THE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD AND AS

02:03:37.843 --> 02:03:39.078
WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN A BIGGER.

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.179
ABOUT PICTURE AND GET TO THAT TO

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:42.581

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:43.883
OF THAT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:45.217
THERE ON BEHALF OF THOSE THAT I

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.085
THINK ARE --

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:48.287
UNFORTUNATELY MISTREATED BY SOME

02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:49.321
OF THE OTHER POLICIES THAT HAVE

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:54.326
COME TO THIS BUILDING.

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:55.594
FIGURES CHAIR.

CONSTITUENTS WHO LOST THEIR

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:14.180

02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:16.148

AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS OVERALL

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:31.797
QUESTION OF WHAT WE DO.

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.299
ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY IN THE

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:34.466

02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:59.652
AND SO I VERY MUCH HE HAS BEEN A

02:05:59.718 --> 02:06:01.153
LOT OF RABBIT TRAILS --

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.655
YOU KNOW IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:04.290
I THINK THE HEART OF YOUR BILL

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.391
IS ABOUT.

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:07.927
RAISING THE BAR --

02:06:07.993 --> 02:06:09.561
FOR SAFETY THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:11.263
THERE'S DEFICIENCIES OUT THERE.

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:13.399
BOB AND IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.401
A DEFINITE STANDARD --

02:06:15.467 --> 02:06:17.169
A SAFETY STANDARD TIME FOR

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:19.138
BEFORE I USE.

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:22.041
AND SO KNOW WE NEED TO DO THAT

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:22.641
THERE IS GOING TO BE A COST TO

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:23.275
DO IT.

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:24.944
THERE'S A COST TO DOING WHAT IT

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:26.211
TAKES TO IMPROVE OUR

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:28.013
INFRASTRUCTURE MAKE IT SAFER.

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.415
AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:31.016
BORNE BY RATE PAYERS ALONE.

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:31.583
AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.018
INTENT.

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:34.887
THAT AND AND AND I DON'T THINK

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.956
THE BILL EVEN SAYS THAT SO --

02:06:37.022 --> 02:06:38.624
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:40.059
TO STILL REMAIN TO BE WORKING

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:42.528
NOT WORKED ON NO GOING FORWARD I

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:44.029
GUESS MY TWO BIG CONCERNS WOULD

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:45.230
BE I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT

02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:46.265
WHAT A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:47.700
WAS THAT MEAN LET'S.

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:50.135
LET'S DEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS OR

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:51.537
MAYBE JUST SAY COMPLIANCE VIA

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.772
COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN --

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:56.108
SHOWS THAT YOU'RE PRUDENT --

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.609
AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER PART

02:06:57.676 --> 02:07:07.052
WOULD BE IN AND AND PERHAPS

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:07.686
SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:07.987
IS -- NEAR

02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:08.620
AYE I HEAR THE COMPLAINTS FROM

02:07:08.687 --> 02:07:09.121
FROM THE OPPOSITION --

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:09.788
THAT THIS MAYBE SETS UP A NEW --

02:07:09.855 --> 02:07:10.389
PROCESS RIGHT THAT COULD BE

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:14.326
MAYBE MAYBE THIS PROCESS COULD

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:14.927
BE PUT INTO THE GENERAL RATE

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:15.527
MAKING PROCESS OR OTHER SAFETY

02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:16.996
PROCESS HE'S THAT --

02:07:17.062 --> 02:07:20.099
ARTIGO THROUGH THE PC. TO AVOID

02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:21.834
TO AVOID SORT OF DUPLICATION OR

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.435
DIEM MAYBE MORE COSTLY --

02:07:23.502 --> 02:07:26.205
PROCESS HE'S TO THE PC.

02:07:26.271 --> 02:07:27.539
ARE NOT UP THAT'S IS IS THAT

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.174

THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.900
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT --

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:57.236
YOUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN ONE OF

02:07:57.302 --> 02:07:59.671
THE HARDEST HIT.

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.607
WITH THAT MANY OF THESE ISSUES --

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:06.211
BUT I AS FOR AS THE BEING THERE

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:08.247
PRESENTED WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:12.117
I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:13.619
I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:16.088
ABOUT HOW WE CANNOT DO.

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:17.189
WE WE WE CANNOT STAND BY AND DO

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:20.092
NOTHING.

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:21.593
BUT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING HERE

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.828
BY [inaudible]

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.930

02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:34.006
THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. TO BE

02:08:34.073 --> 02:08:35.407
UTILITIES AND TO ALL THE

02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:40.179
ELECTRICAL WORKERS.

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:43.715
MY PROBLEM IS WITH THIS.

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:44.950
ALMOST BLANK CHECK THAT WE'RE

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:49.755
PASSING. TO PASS THE COSTS.

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:53.225
ONTO RATE PAYERS.

THE TERM LETTER ON PAGE.

02:08:56.395 --> 02:08:57.229
TWO INDICATES THAT UNDER THE

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:59.231
PROPOSED.

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.766
PC SECTION A UTILITY IN

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:02.234
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THIS

02:09:02.301 --> 02:09:03.168
PLAN.

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:04.403
WOULD BE INSULATED FROM A

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.772
FINDING OF IMPRUDENCE EVEN IF

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:08.774
UTILITY NEGLIGENCE COST A WAD

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:15.147
FAR OF THE DISASTER.

02:09:15.214 --> 02:09:15.681
I THINK AS A MATTER OF

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.416
INTERPRETATION I THINK IT'S A AS

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:18.517
POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:24.756
ANALYSIS.

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:28.060
WHEN THE UTILITY?

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.128
THEN AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:32.030
BUT I'M READING FROM THE

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:33.799
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THE WHEN THE

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:34.800
UTILITIES.

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:36.735
ISN'T SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:37.936
WHAT'S WITH FILED AND IMPROVE

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:39.104
SAFETY RELIABILITY RESILIENCE

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:42.574
PLAN.

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:43.876
THAT THEY WOULD BE OF THE PASS

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:47.146
ON THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:47.446
[inaudible]

02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:51.383
AND SO.

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:52.885
LIKE WITH ANY COMPLICATED

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.286
PROCESS WE NEED TO HAVE DUE

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:55.687
PROCESS WE NEED TO HAVE

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:57.322
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAKEHOLDERS.

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:59.391
TO BE OF THE WAY AND BEFORE THE

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.492
COSTS ARE PASSED ON TO

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:05.430
RATEPAYERS AND SO.

02:10:05.497 --> 02:10:07.933
I'M AFRAID THAT WE ARE MAKING.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.969
A BAD SITUATION EVEN WORSE.

02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:12.504
BY PASSING THIS BILL ALONG.

02:10:12.571 --> 02:10:14.573
AND FOR THAT REASON.

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:19.945
I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:20.245
[inaudible]

02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:22.381
SHOOTING.

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:23.882
I THINK MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:26.318
ECHO NAM MISTER COURSE COMMENTS

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:29.154
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:31.023
THOUGH LE UN I'VE DISCREETLY

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:32.491
COMMITTED I HOPE IT'LL BE THE

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:33.992
LAST TIME AS WELL.

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:37.362
I I DO FEEL ON THAT ONE OF THEIR

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:38.363
COMPLAINTS THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.265
HAD.

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:43.168
HAS BEEN REALLY THE BEHAVIOR ALL

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:44.970
THE REGULATORS AS WELL AS ALL

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:45.537
THE DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATIVE

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:46.205
AGENCIES.

02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:48.307
I OFTENTIMES MANY PEOPLE ON

02:10:48.373 --> 02:10:50.175
DIFFERENT SIDES --

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:52.044
DISCUSS SORT OF FIVE AND TPC

02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:53.745
OVERSTEPPING THAT'S BEEN ONE OF

02:10:53.812 --> 02:10:55.380
MY COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST.

02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:58.150
BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IF WE AS

02:10:58.217 --> 02:11:00.219
A GOVERNMENT DON'T GIVE THE CPUC

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.720
DIRECTION THEN [inaudible]

02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:03.488
THE THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:04.856
WANT.

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:07.359
SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:08.994
TO PROVIDE THEM DIRECTION THIS

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:10.128
IS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE.

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:11.396
DIRECTION HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:13.165
THE COMMISSIONERS.

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:13.665
AND THAT --

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:15.467
THIS IS THE DIRECTION THE

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:16.935
SENATOR --

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:18.303
FROM NAPA HAS PROVIDED AYE BUT I

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.706
BELIEVE IT'S A SENSIBLE PLAN I

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:21.907
THINK IT'S A PRUDENT PLAN I

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.542
DON'T THINK IT OVER STEPS.

02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:25.544
I THINK I THINK HE'S COMPLETELY

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:28.247
CORRECT THAT SHOULD WE HAVE --

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:30.549
A BROADER PLAN IN THE NEXT

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:31.116
COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE END OF

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:32.150
SESSION.

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.752
THAT HIS BILL ARE CAN BE

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:35.487
INCORPORATOR THE IDEAS HERE CAN

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:36.989
BE INCORPORATED IN SOME.

02:11:37.055 --> 02:11:37.823
SORT OF LARGER PROGRAMS I THINK

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:40.025
IT IS.

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:41.360
THAT WE SEE AS A LEGISLATURE

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:44.029
THAT WE WE LEGISLATE AND PROVIDE

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:47.332
THAT DIRECTION TO THE CPUC.

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:48.867
AYE AND THAT THEY DON'T JUST GET

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:51.536
TO DECIDE. TO DO WHATEVER THEY

02:11:51.603 --> 02:11:52.204
WANT HOWEVER THEY WANT WHENEVER

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.705
THEY WANT --

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.641
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CORE

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:58.076
CROCKS OF THE OF THE BILL DOES

02:11:58.143 --> 02:11:59.177
COME IN TWO PARTS WHERE.

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:01.179
WE HAVE A PLAN.

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:02.547
THE PLANS AGREED UPON WITH THE

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:05.784
REGULATE REGULATOR BUT IF.

02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:08.053
THE PLAN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IF

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.588
THE PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT

02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:12.324
THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:14.760
RECOURSE FOR FOR THE DELAY SO I

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.361
THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:17.896
OTHERWISE IF YOU HAVE A PLAN.

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:19.231
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:21.433
AT THE END I THINK THE PLAN IN

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:22.234
OF ITSELF.

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:24.336
ISN'T REALLY USE FOR ANYTHING

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:25.737
DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE ANY

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.606
DIRECTION JUST BECOMES JUST

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:28.273
ANOTHER.

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.442
PIECE OF PAPER TO SIT ON TOP OF

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:31.810
PILES OF PIECE OF PAPER OVER THE

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:33.178
CPUC.

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:34.913
THE SO SO THAT IS WHY TODAY AND

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.548
SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT IS

02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:40.052
A GOOD FIRST STEP INTO WHAT IS --

02:12:40.118 --> 02:12:41.253
WHAT IS OCCURRING --

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.654
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S

02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:44.189
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:12:44.256 --> 02:12:45.590
PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION TO THIS

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:49.661
COMMISSION.

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:50.729
THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS OF I

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:54.132
THINK IT'S SENATOR DODD.

YOU -- HAVE

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:59.738
AS I INDICATED EARLIER ON TAKEN

02:12:59.805 --> 02:13:00.806
ON THE ISSUE AND YOU'VE

02:13:00.872 --> 02:13:04.109

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:17.656
EVALUATE ALL BILLS THAT COME

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:19.291
FORTH ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:21.626

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.589
PILOT PROGRAMS.

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:27.958
OUR MEMBERS NEED DATA ABOUT THIS

02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:29.160
TECHNOLOGY IF THEY'RE GOING TO

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:31.362
CONSIDER IN THEIR IRE P. WITHOUT

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:32.363
THAT DATA THEY HAVE NO WAY OF

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:33.764
KNOWING HOW TO CONSIDER THEIR

02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:34.699
IRE P..

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:35.766
FURTHERMORE WE THINK SOME

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:37.968
LANGUAGE WOULD BE NEEDED AND TO

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:39.103
ENSURE THAT WHEN IT'S CONSIDERED

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:41.772
AN IRP THAT AND COST FEASIBILITY

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:42.473
IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:42.773
[inaudible]

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:44.008
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:46.243
THANK YOU.

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:47.545
ARE THERE ANY OTHERS THAT LIKE

02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:50.681
TO RUIN THEIR OPPOSITION.

02:29:50.748 --> 02:29:52.550
SEEING NONE I WILL TURN BACK TO

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:53.617
THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:55.853
QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR.

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.555
DOCTOR QUIRK --

02:29:57.621 --> 02:29:59.790
I'M I'M IN THERE.

02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:02.360
VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS.

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:03.094
ALRIGHT NOW I'VE HYDROGEN

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.563
VEHICLE [inaudible]

02:30:05.629 --> 02:30:07.131
WITHOUT [inaudible]

02:30:07.198 --> 02:30:08.866
THIS [inaudible]

02:30:08.933 --> 02:30:11.135
PROGRAM WE WILL NEVER HAVE

02:30:11.202 --> 02:30:14.238
HYDROGEN VEHICLES IN THIS STATE.

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:18.042
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HYDROGEN COSTS.

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:18.909
EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT DOLLARS A

02:30:18.976 --> 02:30:21.345
GALLON [inaudible]

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:23.681
OF GAS IT.

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:25.483
WHEN YOU USING THE HYDROGEN?

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:26.817
YOU'RE EITHER IT'S GONNA COST

02:30:26.884 --> 02:30:28.619
YOU WHAT IT WOULD HAVE GAS WAS

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:29.587
EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON TO BE

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:31.389
MORE PRECISE.

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:33.457
AND HOW CAN WE BRING THAT THAT

02:30:33.524 --> 02:30:35.259
WELL FIRST OF ALL.

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:36.794
RIGHT NOW TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:39.263
ELECT OF THE HYDROGEN COUNTRY

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:41.132
NATURAL GAS.

02:30:41.198 --> 02:30:42.700
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK IN THE

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:43.768
LONG RUN IT HAS TO COME FROM

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:45.336
ELECTROLYSIS WHICH IS WHAT YOUR

02:30:45.403 --> 02:30:47.938
BILL IS PILOTING.

02:30:48.005 --> 02:30:50.641
AND FURTHERMORE WE JUST DON'T

02:30:50.708 --> 02:30:53.811
KNOW UNTIL WE SCALE OP.

02:30:53.878 --> 02:30:55.212
HOW WELL THIS WILL WORK NOW I

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:56.814
CAN TALK I HAVE TALKED WITH

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.682
TECHNOLOGISTS?

02:30:58.749 --> 02:31:00.451
TO FAST AND KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS

02:31:00.518 --> 02:31:01.752
AND THEY SAY --

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:03.020
WE'VE REALLY GOTTEN THAT THE

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:04.789
TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT WHERE WE

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:07.124
CAN USE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:09.360
PLATINUM AND IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:31:09.427 --> 02:31:10.895
BE THAT EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.263
HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:14.298
THE END NODES IN THE CAFETERIA

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:16.267
AND TO BE REPLACED IN THE

02:31:16.333 --> 02:31:18.068
CHANNEL TO SCALE UP.

02:31:18.135 --> 02:31:19.570
AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT GIVES

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:21.639
US.

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.340
THE FIRST PART OF THE SCALE.

02:31:23.407 --> 02:31:25.109
IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY SCALE UP

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:27.244
BUT IT'S THE NEXT STEP.

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:29.880
AND WITHOUT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS

02:31:29.947 --> 02:31:31.715
WE WON'T SCALE UP WHAT DOES THAT

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:33.517
MEAN WELL ELECTRIC CARS ARE

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:34.652
GOING TO BE GOOD FOR PEOPLE

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:38.222
COMMUTE SMALLER DISTANCES --

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:39.757
PEOPLE WHO HAVE READILY OF IT

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:41.859
READY AVAILABILITY OF CHARGING

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:43.727
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT EVERYBODY.

02:31:43.794 --> 02:31:45.796
AND SOME PEOPLE WILL NEVER

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.431
ADOPTED AND SO.

02:31:47.498 --> 02:31:48.566
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:50.401
ELECTROLYSIS OF HYDROGEN AND

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:52.970
HYDROGEN VEHICLES IN MY OPINION.

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:54.972
AS A SECOND OPTION FOR PEOPLE

02:31:55.039 --> 02:31:56.774
WHO HAVE RANGE ANXIETY FOR

02:31:56.841 --> 02:31:59.610
PEOPLE WITH HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES.

02:31:59.677 --> 02:32:01.312
BOB THAT'S ONE USE THE OTHER

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:02.446
THAT I HEARD --

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:03.547
TALKED ABOUT BY SUPPORTERS WAS

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:06.750
STORAGE --

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.185
YES BATTERIES YOU'RE GOOD IN

02:32:08.252 --> 02:32:09.687
SOME WAYS BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING

02:32:09.753 --> 02:32:11.889
ABOUT SEASONAL STORAGE.

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:13.357
WHICH AT SOME POINT IF WE HAVE

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:14.658
ENOUGH SOLAR IT'S A DIRECTION WE

02:32:14.725 --> 02:32:16.360
GO IN.

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:17.628
THEN HYDROGEN IS A GOOD WAY TO

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:19.396
GO.

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:22.066
SO FOR THOSE MANY REASONS I

02:32:22.132 --> 02:32:24.034
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK

02:32:24.101 --> 02:32:24.602

02:34:16.447 --> 02:34:18.215
MAKING PROCEEDING THAT ADDRESSES

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:19.650
THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY AS

02:34:19.717 --> 02:34:21.018
A FUEL.

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.786

HE TRANSIT AS TRANSIT AGENCIES

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:32.296
MOVED TO AND SCALE UP THEIR

BUSES.

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:36.033
MANY HAVE FOUND THAT THE COST OF

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.968
ELECTRICITY FAR EXCEEDS

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:39.703
CONVENTIONAL FUEL.

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:41.505
IN FACT SOME TRANSIT AGENCIES

02:34:41.572 --> 02:34:43.140
HAVE FOUND THAT THE COST OF FUEL

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:45.142
PER MILE FOR ELECTRIC BUSES CAN

02:34:45.209 --> 02:34:47.845
BE 40% TO TWO TIMES HIGHER THE

02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:50.347
NATURAL GAS AND DIESEL FUEL.

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:52.282
THIS HIGH COST REMAINS TRUE EVEN

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:54.518
WITH STATE INCENTIVES SUCH AS

02:34:54.585 --> 02:34:58.055
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD.

02:34:58.122 --> 02:34:59.289

TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE STATE

02:35:03.961 --> 02:35:05.362
HAS IDENTIFIED THE COST OF

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:06.897
ELECTRICITY IS ONE OF THE TOP

02:35:06.964 --> 02:35:08.399
THREE BARRIERS. TO TRANSIT

02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:10.134
ELECTRIFICATION THE HIGH COST OF

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:11.568
ELECTRICITY AS A FUEL IS

02:35:11.635 --> 02:35:13.103
PREVENTING AND SLOWING THE

THAT FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE --

03:17:23.031 --> 03:17:25.567

WE HAVE A THOUSAND AREAS.

03:29:37.831 --> 03:29:39.700
THEY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY ONE

03:29:39.767 --> 03:29:42.136
FOURTH OF 1% OF THE POPULATION.

03:29:42.202 --> 03:29:43.404

I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING THAT

03:33:07.541 --> 03:33:09.076
CAN BE DONE UNLESS YOU JUST WANT

03:33:09.143 --> 03:33:10.210
TO GET RID OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY

03:33:10.277 --> 03:33:11.712

03:33:18.285 --> 03:33:18.986
THAT -- ARE

03:33:19.052 --> 03:33:21.255
CRITICAL OF OF THIS BILL DON'T

03:33:21.321 --> 03:33:22.823
REALLY UNDERSTAND KIND OF

03:33:22.890 --> 03:33:24.291
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND BY OF

03:33:24.358 --> 03:33:26.026
METHANE AND HOW.

03:33:26.093 --> 03:33:27.961
IT ACTUALLY HAS A NAY IT OUT BY

03:33:28.028 --> 03:33:29.997
USING GOING TO BUY A MATH THING

03:33:30.063 --> 03:33:31.131
YOU ACTUALLY GO INTO.

03:33:31.198 --> 03:33:33.267
A IN TERMS OF MEASURING THE

03:33:33.333 --> 03:33:34.501
IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT YOU

03:33:34.568 --> 03:33:35.936
COULD INTO NEGATIVE IMPACTS

03:33:36.003 --> 03:33:36.603
WHERE.

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:38.939
IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING TO IMPROVE

03:33:39.006 --> 03:33:40.741
AIR QUALITY IF THE MORE BY A MY

03:33:40.807 --> 03:33:42.843
THING YOU YOU USE YOUR ACTUALLY

03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:44.545
PROVING OR QUALITY SO YOU READ.

03:33:44.611 --> 03:33:46.680
WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE --

03:33:46.747 --> 03:33:47.648
METHANE GOING INTO THE

03:33:47.714 --> 03:33:48.882
ENVIRONMENT NATURALLY YOU'RE

03:33:48.949 --> 03:33:50.651
CAPTURING ALL EUROPE PREVENTING

03:33:50.717 --> 03:33:52.286
THAT FROM GOING INTO SO IF YOU

03:33:52.352 --> 03:33:53.420
LIVE IN AN AREA THAT'S IMPACTED

03:33:53.487 --> 03:33:54.521
BY.

03:33:54.588 --> 03:33:56.023
BY DAIRY INDUSTRY YOU'RE

03:33:56.089 --> 03:33:58.325
ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE.

03:33:58.392 --> 03:34:00.327
THOSE AREAS CLEANER RANK AT AND

03:34:00.394 --> 03:34:02.529
I I MEAN.

03:34:02.596 --> 03:34:04.064
THAT'S NOT JUST GONNA HAPPEN ON

03:34:04.131 --> 03:34:05.899
ITS OWN YOU ACTUALLY NEED A

03:34:05.966 --> 03:34:07.201
PROGRAM TO DO THAT PROGRAMS COST

03:34:07.267 --> 03:34:09.002
MONEY.

03:34:09.069 --> 03:34:10.571
AND YOU GOTTA FIND A WAY TO

03:34:10.637 --> 03:34:12.372
COMFORT THAT ENERGY INTO A

03:34:12.439 --> 03:34:14.241
USABLE FORM.

03:34:14.308 --> 03:34:15.776
BUT YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT

03:34:15.842 --> 03:34:17.110
SAY THAT THEIR RATE PAYERS ARE

03:34:17.177 --> 03:34:19.146
GOING TO BE FUNDING THIS.

03:34:19.213 --> 03:34:20.247
THEY'RE REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE

03:34:20.314 --> 03:34:22.382
ALSO EMPLOYED BY THIS.

03:34:22.449 --> 03:34:24.885
SO IT'S KIND OF A A CIRCLE IN

03:34:24.952 --> 03:34:27.487
THAT YOU'RE RECYCLING.

03:34:27.554 --> 03:34:29.856
A DOLLARS INSIDER STATE INSTEAD

03:34:29.923 --> 03:34:32.159
OF STANDING EVERY TIME.

03:34:32.226 --> 03:34:34.094
I USE NATURAL GAS ON MY STOVE

03:34:34.161 --> 03:34:35.963
I'M ACTUALLY SENDING MY MONEY.

03:34:36.029 --> 03:34:38.365
TO EITHER AUSTRALIA OR CANADA OR

03:34:38.432 --> 03:34:39.466
SOME OTHER PART OF THE WORLD BUT

03:34:39.533 --> 03:34:40.934
NOT CALIFORNIA WE'RE CREATING

03:34:41.001 --> 03:34:42.603
JOBS THERE.

03:34:42.669 --> 03:34:44.838
BUT WE'RE NOT CREATING JOBS HERE.

03:34:44.905 --> 03:34:47.107
AND AND THERE IS A FINANCIAL

03:34:47.174 --> 03:34:48.575
BENEFIT TO THAT THERE'S SUCH A

03:34:48.642 --> 03:34:50.277
MEASURABLE.

03:34:50.344 --> 03:34:52.179
BENEFIT TO OUR ECONOMY THAT WHEN

03:34:52.246 --> 03:34:53.513
YOU LOOKED SIMPLY LOOK AT IT

03:34:53.580 --> 03:34:54.514
SAID THIS IS GOING INCREASED

03:34:54.581 --> 03:34:55.782
COSTS YOU BUT THIS IS ALSO THE

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:56.483
INCREASE JOBS.

03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:58.585
AND IF YOU JUST TOOK THE COST

03:34:58.652 --> 03:34:59.553
PART OF IT OUT.

03:34:59.620 --> 03:35:01.655
I BET WE TOOK IT OUT WHAT THE

03:35:01.722 --> 03:35:04.291
WHAT THE WHAT THE INTENT OF OF

03:35:04.358 --> 03:35:06.093
FURTHER WORKING ON IT TO ENSURE

03:35:06.159 --> 03:35:07.694
A WE WE WE WANNA.

03:35:07.761 --> 03:35:08.562
I THINK THE CHAIRMAN AND I COULD

03:35:08.629 --> 03:35:11.431
AGREE THAT WE WANT.

03:35:11.498 --> 03:35:13.467
BUT THERE IS NO WAY FORWARD ON

03:35:13.533 --> 03:35:14.735
THIS BILL WITHOUT SOME KIND OF

03:35:14.801 --> 03:35:19.806
OF WAY TO A INCENTIVIZE.

03:35:19.873 --> 03:35:21.341
THE CREATION OF THESE JOBS THE

03:35:21.408 --> 03:35:23.043
INCENTIVIZE IT AND IT'S JUST NOT

03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:24.878
GONNA HAPPEN ON ITS OWN IF IT

03:35:24.945 --> 03:35:26.446
DID WE WOULDN'T NEED THIS BUT WE

03:35:26.513 --> 03:35:27.881
WANT TO BE TALK NEAR.

03:35:27.948 --> 03:35:29.683
YEAH WHAT IN OUR STARTED SOLAR

03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:30.250
WE WANNA START IT NGUYEN IN

03:35:30.317 --> 03:35:31.518
CALIFORNIA.

03:35:31.585 --> 03:35:33.086
WITHOUT WITHOUT COMING UP WITH

03:35:33.153 --> 03:35:34.521
MANDATES LIKE THIS ONE WITHOUT

03:35:34.588 --> 03:35:36.723
COMING UP WITH WAYS. TO FUND

03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:38.325
THESE PROJECTS BUT NOW.

03:35:38.392 --> 03:35:40.027
IT'S BECOME THE MOST COMPETITIVE

03:35:40.093 --> 03:35:41.361
ENERGY SOURCE I THINK WE'RE

03:35:41.428 --> 03:35:42.462
HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT WE

03:35:42.529 --> 03:35:44.031
GOT TO GIVE IT A LITTLE NUDGE.

03:35:44.097 --> 03:35:45.932
AND THEN AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY

03:35:45.999 --> 03:35:47.334
TO NOT ONLY CREATE A VERY

03:35:47.401 --> 03:35:48.435
COMPETITIVE.

03:35:48.502 --> 03:35:50.270
INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO

03:35:50.337 --> 03:35:51.371
HELPING TO ADDRESS OUR

03:35:51.438 --> 03:35:53.507
ENVIRONMENT PROBLEMS THERE'S

03:35:53.573 --> 03:35:55.375
ANOTHER PART OF THIS THAT SAYS.

03:35:55.442 --> 03:35:57.611
WE HAVE A PILOT PROGRAM.

03:35:57.678 --> 03:35:58.712
WHY DO YOU FEEL THIS IS AND DID

03:35:58.779 --> 03:36:00.113
NEEDED IN ADDITION TO THE PILOT

03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:02.282
PROGRAM?

03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:04.151
YOU WANNA CHECK INTO CHAIR

03:36:04.217 --> 03:36:05.452
PLEASE SOFAS.

03:36:05.519 --> 03:36:07.354
THERE IS AN ON GOING PILOT --

03:36:07.421 --> 03:36:09.256
AT THIS TPC AT THAT DEAL

03:36:09.323 --> 03:36:11.291
SPECIFICALLY WITH DAIRY PROJECTS

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:14.561
NOW IS DONE UP PURSUANT TO S. B.

03:36:14.628 --> 03:36:15.128
THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHERE

03:36:15.195 --> 03:36:16.797
THERE WAS SOME QUESTION THERE

03:36:16.863 --> 03:36:18.165
HADN'T BEEN ANY DAIRY PROJECTS

03:36:18.231 --> 03:36:19.433
AS OF YET.

03:36:19.499 --> 03:36:20.067
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

03:36:20.133 --> 03:36:22.169
INTERCONNECTED AND THE DAIRY

03:36:22.235 --> 03:36:23.904
INDUSTRY WAS ABLE --

03:36:23.970 --> 03:36:25.038
TO WORK TOGETHER WITH SENATOR

03:36:25.105 --> 03:36:26.540
LARA -- TO

03:36:26.606 --> 03:36:29.810
CREATE A PILOT MECHANISM WHERE

03:36:29.876 --> 03:36:33.380
1100% OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

03:36:33.447 --> 03:36:35.082
THAT'S NOT WHAT SENATOR HUESO IS

03:36:35.148 --> 03:36:35.849
IS --

03:36:35.916 --> 03:36:36.383
PROPOSING FOR THIS BILL IT

03:36:36.450 --> 03:36:39.419
SOUNDS SOMETHING MORE CONSISTENT

03:36:39.486 --> 03:36:41.922
WITH 50% WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO

03:36:41.988 --> 03:36:43.390
OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT IT WAS IT

03:36:43.457 --> 03:36:46.360
WAS A DAIRY SPECIFIC PILOT ON

03:36:46.426 --> 03:36:47.728
THAT BEING SAID SO THERE ARE

03:36:47.794 --> 03:36:49.363
OTHER SECTORS HERE WASTE WATER

03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:51.098
LANDFILL ENDEAVORED ORGANIC

03:36:51.164 --> 03:36:52.432
WASTE THAT ARE ENVISIONED NONE

03:36:52.499 --> 03:36:53.266
OF THOSE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

03:36:53.333 --> 03:36:54.067
PILOT.

03:36:54.134 --> 03:36:55.669
THEY HAD BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED

03:36:55.736 --> 03:36:57.904
THE COSTS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD IN

03:36:57.971 --> 03:36:59.973
CALIFORNIA OF THOSE SECTORS --

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:01.341
AND SO GOES BEYOND DARIAN ALSO

03:37:01.408 --> 03:37:03.210
IN THAT SAME THIRTEEN EIGHTY

03:37:03.276 --> 03:37:04.678
THREE REPORT THAT WAS DONE BY

03:37:04.745 --> 03:37:06.279
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION.

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:07.748
IT ACTUALLY SAYS --

03:37:07.814 --> 03:37:09.249
YES EPC SHOULD CONTINUE WITH

03:37:09.316 --> 03:37:10.751
THEIR PILOTS BUT AT THE SAME

03:37:10.817 --> 03:37:12.185
TIME AIR BE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

03:37:12.252 --> 03:37:13.687
ON PROCUREMENT AND

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:15.188
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND WE

03:37:15.255 --> 03:37:16.990
DID A CLARIFY THAT WITH THE CDC

03:37:17.057 --> 03:37:17.824
TO MAKE SURE.

03:37:17.891 --> 03:37:19.126
THEY DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT WOULD

03:37:19.192 --> 03:37:21.728
BE PREMATURE AND AND THEY DID

03:37:21.795 --> 03:37:24.164
CONFIRM THAT FOR US.

03:37:24.231 --> 03:37:26.500
THAT'S WHY GOING.

03:37:26.566 --> 03:37:27.501
I WASN'T CHAIRMAN A TO ANSWER

03:37:27.567 --> 03:37:29.369
YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY TO

03:37:29.436 --> 03:37:30.036
ONE INDUSTRY.

03:37:30.103 --> 03:37:32.239
THE SOLID WASTE RECYCLING

03:37:32.305 --> 03:37:33.740
INDUSTRY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

03:37:33.807 --> 03:37:36.276
WE HAVE TWENTY MILLION TONS THAT

03:37:36.343 --> 03:37:37.811
ARE REQUIRED TO COME OUT OF THE

03:37:37.878 --> 03:37:40.380
LANDFILL BY.

03:37:40.447 --> 03:37:41.715
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND GROWING.

03:37:41.782 --> 03:37:43.884
SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AVENUES

03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:46.319
THAT'S NOT A PILOT PROGRAM AYE

03:37:46.386 --> 03:37:48.755
IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT

03:37:48.822 --> 03:37:50.323
THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRED.

03:37:50.390 --> 03:37:52.492
US ALL THE MUNICIPALITIES ALL

03:37:52.559 --> 03:37:54.294
THE COUNTIES AND ALL OF THEIR

03:37:54.361 --> 03:37:56.763
PROVIDERS I TO TAKE THIS OUT OF

03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:58.365
THE LANDFILL SO THIS IS A VERY

03:37:58.432 --> 03:38:00.434
CRITICAL PIECE THAT WILL MOVE

03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:01.635
THAT FORWARD.

03:38:01.701 --> 03:38:03.203
WE THINK COST CONTAINMENT IS

03:38:03.270 --> 03:38:05.172
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BUT AS THE

03:38:05.238 --> 03:38:06.873
SENATOR SAID THERE HAS TO BE AN

03:38:06.940 --> 03:38:08.575
INCENTIVE AND THIS IS THAT

03:38:08.642 --> 03:38:10.310
INCENTIVE SO RELEASE HELP US DO

03:38:10.377 --> 03:38:12.913
WHAT THE LAW THAT YOU ALL PASSED --

03:38:12.979 --> 03:38:15.015
WITH SENATOR LARA DID YOU AND TO

03:38:15.081 --> 03:38:17.551
ME IT ACTUALLY IS THE LANDFILL

03:38:17.617 --> 03:38:18.685
PART.

03:38:18.752 --> 03:38:19.886
BECAUSE IT IS UTTERLY

03:38:19.953 --> 03:38:21.555
UNCONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLABLE

03:38:21.621 --> 03:38:23.523
UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING.

03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:24.691
AND RIGHT NOW THE METHANE WE

03:38:24.758 --> 03:38:26.460
HAVE.

03:38:26.526 --> 03:38:27.694
OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS

03:38:27.761 --> 03:38:29.262
COMING OUT.

03:38:29.329 --> 03:38:29.996
IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

03:38:30.063 --> 03:38:31.898
SOURCE.

03:38:31.965 --> 03:38:33.066
AND AGAIN IT'S A MATTER OF

03:38:33.133 --> 03:38:35.101
CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WAY

03:38:35.168 --> 03:38:36.736
SHOWING THAT THIS CAN BE DONE.

03:38:36.803 --> 03:38:38.238
I YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY IN

03:38:38.305 --> 03:38:39.473
THE BEGINNING WITH I AM

03:38:39.539 --> 03:38:41.575
CONCERNED THAT THE MONEY WAS NOW

03:38:41.641 --> 03:38:43.877
TAKEN OUT BUT WELL WE'LL SEE

03:38:43.944 --> 03:38:45.345
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PROCESS

03:38:45.412 --> 03:38:46.847
GOES ALONG --

03:38:46.913 --> 03:38:48.281
ANYWAY I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF

03:38:48.348 --> 03:38:52.619

IS THERE A MOTION TO TO MOVE THE

03:38:55.455 --> 03:38:56.089
BILL.

03:38:56.156 --> 03:38:57.591
ITSELF.

03:38:57.657 --> 03:39:00.026
OKAY NOW IT'S MOVED OUT.

03:39:00.093 --> 03:39:00.427
I WAS [inaudible]

03:39:00.494 --> 03:39:04.431
THE ISSUE AND I HAD TO WHICH IS
