00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:09.054
UNDERSTAND THE MOUNTAIN OF

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.756
THINGS THAT THEY ARE NEVER DEALT

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:11.690
WITH.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:13.225
TRYING TO GET A PERMIT AND

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.261
TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES I

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.195
THINK YOU WOULD.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.730
UNDERSTAND THE BILL FOR THIS

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:18.364
BILL I DO SO.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.933
SO YEAH SO MY POINT IS IS THAT

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.433
LOOK.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.868
IT IS MAY NOT BE A PERFECT BILL

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.470
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:26.272
THE GRID AND ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.740
WE HAD WE WE NEED TO DO I'LL BE

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:28.674
MORE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:29.408
THAT.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.577
WE ALSO IN SOME AREAS WE OVER

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.246
PRODUCE SOLAR IN IN IT WE ARE

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.114
ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE DOT CURVE

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.982
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME PLACES

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.184
WE WE SHOULD MAYBE.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.985
NOT LOOK AT SOLAR LOOK AT OTHER

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.654
ALTERNATIVES -- BECAUSE OF

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.621
PUTTING SOLAR THERE AND WE NEED

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:43.622
TO DO STORAGE IS THE I THINK THE

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:45.791
KEY HERE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.793
ON STORAGE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.327
FOCUS ON THIS THIS BILL IS

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.996
FOCUSED ON PEOPLE WHO JUST LOST.

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:53.399
LOVED ONES AND WHO ARE.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:56.101
AT VERY LOW -- WAGE AND NEED TO

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.436
REBUILD THEIR LIVES AND SO

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:58.237
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FOCUSED AT

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.905
NO I I KNOW THEM.

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.440

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.908
TAKE THEM OUT OF THE MUCK MYSELF

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.877
AND AND MY BIG CONCERN IS THAT

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.145
THEIR PASSIVE IN THE

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.313
HOMEBUILDING PROCESS LIKE WHEN

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.847
YOU OWN A MOBILE HOME.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.683
YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF SAY SO IN

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:11.250
WHAT THAT THING LOOKS LIKE

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.184
COMING BACK.

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.253
AND THAT DEVELOPERS NOT GOING TO

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.120
GIVE YOU A LOT OF OPTIONS SO

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.155
EVEN IF THEY COULD BUILD A

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.823
PACKAGE THAT LOOKED.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.459
IDENTICAL TO LIKE WITH WITH SOME

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.161
BACK UP POWER MAYBE SOME SOLAR

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:28.968
MAYBE A BATTERY MAYBE SOME OTHER

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.603
RESOURCE AND WITHOUT.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:31.237
THEY COULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY GET

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:31.904
YOU THAT HOME FOR THE SAME SAME

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:32.571
COSTS BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.173
THAT THE DEVELOPER DOESN'T SO MY

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.707
CONCERN IS IF WE IF WERE.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:35.674

WITH THAT ISSUE AND I DON'T

THINK SOLAR'S THE PROBLEM I

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:56.829
THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.671
COMMONSENSE MEASURE.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.539
ALL WE TALK ABOUT THE FORD

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:08.874
ABILITY OF HOUSING ON A DAILY

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.377
BASIS IN THIS LEGISLATURE.

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:13.312
AND I'VE TALKED TO REALTORS AS

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:16.215
WELL AS I ATTENDED A HOMEOWNERS --

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:19.251
ASSOCIATION MINUTE MEETING LAST

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:19.685
THURSDAY MY DISTRICT

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:19.985
[inaudible]

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.454
AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.990
SELLING NEW HOMES IS ADDITIONAL

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.525
CUTS AFFORDABILITY.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.394
AND NOW THE DISH NO COST OF

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.429
ADDING SOLAR TO NEW CONSTRUCTION

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.631
ADDS THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.266
DOLLARS TO NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.834

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.835
HOMES.

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:37.770
SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.772
MEASURE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.540
THEIR HOMES WE'VE HEARD TIME AND

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:45.311

THE THEY LEFT BUILDING THE SAME

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.452
STRUCTURE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.053
TO DO IT.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.921
JUST WHAT OUT THE SOLAR AND NOW

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.289
YOU ADD THAT ADDITIONAL COST SO

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.291
THIS IS NOT ABOUT NOT BEING

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.226
ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE IT'S

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.761
NOT ABOUT YOU KNOW.

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.797
NOT CARING ABOUT -- RENEWABLE

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.932
ENERGY THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.667
FOLKS TO GET BACK IN A HOME AT

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.703
AFFORDABLE RATES YOU TALK TO

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:11.704
REALTORS AND THIS IS THE HARDEST

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.941
HOME TO SAIL ON THE MARKET TODAY

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.343
IS HOMES WITH SOLAR.

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:19.044
AND WE NEED TO HAVE GROWN UP

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.447

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:22.614
AND AND LOOK AT WORK WE'RE

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:24.249
CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE NOT BEING

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.484
ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME.

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.852
THIS DOES NOT HELP FOLKS GET

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.454
BACK INTO THEIR HOMES WE SHOULD

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.688
HELP FOLKS WHATEVER MEANS

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.557
POSSIBLE TO GET BACK IN THEIR

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:32.858
HOMES YOU TALK THE BUILDING

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.660
ASSOCIATION.

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.995
THE MANDATORY SOLAR BILL HOUSE

HOME PRICES TO GO UP IN THE

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:40.599

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.078
GENERAL.

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.613

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.315
CASE AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:12.017
TO REBUILD IT'S IN MY VIEW A

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.552
LITTLE BIT NARROWER.

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:14.653
AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.455
MOMENT THAT YOU TOOK I THINK

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:18.056
THAT -- WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

COMPASSION AT THIS POINT WE WE

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.226
WANT TO HELP THESE PEOPLE TO GET

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.728
BACK INTO HOMES AND SO I DON'T

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.795

I THINK WE'LL HAVE VALID.

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.399
POINTS AND I THINK WE ALL CARE

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.234
VERY MCH ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:31.169
AND ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.205
BUT I CAN I THINK THIS IS JUST

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.673
GOING TO HELP THESE FOLKS BACK

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.709

SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AN AGAIN I THINK THIS

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:43.549
BILL IS ABOUT SHOWING COMPASSION

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:44.683
UNDERSTANDING HELPING PEOPLE

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.252
RESERVE -- REBUILD.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.287
AND AND IN THAT REGARD I I I

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:53.025
SUPPORTED -- BUT WHEN YOU TALK

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.427
ABOUT THIS BILL NOT SOLVING THE

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.762
ENTIRE PROBLEM.

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:59.932
I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- WHEN THE

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:01.533
ENERGY COMMISSION CAME OUT WITH

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.435
ITS MANDATE REQUIRING SOLAR AND

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.604
EVERY NEW HOME?

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.639
YOU KNOW I I I STRUGGLED WITH

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.540
THAT DECISION.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:12.277
ON THE BASIS OF THE FACT THAT --

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.513
CURRENTLY OUR NAME RATES.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.082
OUR OUR OUR CAN BE FOUR FIVE

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.984
TIMES HIGHER.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.588
THEN -- PROCURING -- SOLAR.

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.623
FROM A SOLAR FARM.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.625
EN EN WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.093
LIKE THAT REQUIRE AN ALL NEW

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.494
CONSTRUCTION HAVE SOLAR.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.563
WHAT IS THAT GONNA DUE TO RATES

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.864
IN OUR STATE?

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.366
THEY MADE A DECISION.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.201
INDEPENDENT OF THAT WITHOUT

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.470
ADDRESSING THE COST SHIFT IT'S

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:39.805
GOING TO TAKE PLACE.

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.406
AND THE IMBALANCE THAT IT'S

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:41.974
GOING TO CREATE ON THE DEPTH

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.642
CHART.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.910
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.845
THINK NEED TO BE.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.813
ARE DISCUSSED BY THIS

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.615
LEGISLATURE.

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.383
WE NEED A MAN ENSURE THAT THERE

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.453
ISN'T A COST SHIFT TAKING PLACE.

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.587
THAT'S GONNA AND SOLD.

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:56.221
WHAT WITH THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.223
TRYING TO GIVE?

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.759
UP POORER OR LET LOWER INCOME

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.028
HOMEOWNERS A REPRIEVE.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.464
BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- BY NOT

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.099
APPROVING THIS BILL WHAT WERE

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.534
PASSING COST -- TO OF PEOPLE

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.370
THAT ARE.

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.704
THAT ARE ARE ARE POOR IN THE

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.705
COMMUNITY THAT CAN AFFORD SO

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.474
LEARN I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.309
OF SO FAR WE'RE NOT GIVEN AWAY

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.510
SOLAR.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.846
BUT EVEN IF WE DID.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:23.081
IT ADDED IT IT IT RESULTS IN A

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.750
COST SHIFT IN RATES THAT'S A

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.418
THAT'S THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.020
TO SPECIFIC PEOPLE IN OUR

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.788
COMMUNITY.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.357
THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SOLAR.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:35.127
OR OR OR CAN'T GET A FREE SOLAR

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.928
PANEL EVEN IF.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.397
YOU SAY WELL IS THAT DOES IT

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.465
WON'T COST YOU ANYTHING I GUESS

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:42.367
THIS I GUESS PEOPLE THAT SAY IT

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:43.468
DOESN'T COST YOU IN ANYTHING

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:45.604
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:46.905
GOING INTO DEBT.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.740
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:52.177
OF OF OF OF IN SOMETHING.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:54.346
AND I'M HOW MUCH HOW MANY OF

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:55.914
THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.015
BE PUT INTO OUR COMMUNITY.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.918
THEY'RE ALSO GONNA RESULT IN AN

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.388
INCREASE LIABILITY TO THE TWO IF

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:04.823
THE BURNED AGAIN WE HAVE TO NOT

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.191
ONLY REPLACE THE HOME BUT THE

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:08.093
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.095
AND AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE IT

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.663
ADDRESS THE LIABILITY ISSUE IN

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.765
THAT AT A TIME WE HAVE AN

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.167
ADDRESS THE BALANCING ISSUE.

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:16.368
AND A TIME THAT WE HAVE AN

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:19.371
ADDRESS TO COST YOU FIFTY ISSUE.

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:22.107
WE HAVE A A ALL ALL FULL OF

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.142
MANDATE I AM I HAVE.

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.877
ENORMOUS CONCERNS OF THAT I

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:28.413
THINK THIS BILL I DON'T WANT TO

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.248
THROW THIS BILL INTO THAT DEBATE.

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:31.616
BECAUSE I THINK IT SEPARATE THIS

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.719
IS A SEPARATE ISSUE.

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.053
ALL I'M SAYING IS THERE A LOT OF

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.988
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES TO

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.390
CONSIDER IN THIS BALANCE.

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:39.891
AND I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.526
MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S A A

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:42.627
GOOD GESTURE.

ELECTRICITY.

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.552
CHEAPER RATE.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:10.088
THROUGH OF THE LARGER

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.057

UNDOING THIS.

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.266

TAX GUY -- BUT THIS IS AN

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:35.800
EXISTING TAX THAT I HAVE SEEN

ONLY WITH MY CONSTITUENTS BUT

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.642
EVEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY -- WE

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:48.947
HAVE A REMARKABLE INCIDENTS OF

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.982

FOLKS THAT -- ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:56.087
COGNITIVE DISABILITIES THAT ARE

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:57.388
GONNA BE NEEDING THIS TYPE OF A

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.256
SERVICE.

00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:59.624
AND SO THE ONLY QUESTION AND I

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:02.527
REALLY HAVE FOR YOU IS IS WHY

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:03.361
WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:05.196
SUNSET ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.631
PROGRAM THESE.

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:09.400
COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES ARE GOING

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.169
TO CONTINUE ON UNDERSTANDING

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:12.470
THAT WE HOPEFULLY IT WILL HAVE

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.605
SOME MEDICAL ADVANCES THAT WILL

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.406
MITIGATE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.708
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:18.343
ANYTIME IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:20.178
OR SEVEN YEARS IS THERE IS A

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:21.079
REASON WHY WE HAVE A SENSE AT

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.647
ALL A WE WERE JUST REQUEST TO

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.649
HAVE A CENTER THAT WAS NO OTHER

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:28.286
REASON I MEAN I I I WOULD AGREE.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:31.356
SO -- NOT BY ME NO IDEA.

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:33.157
OF WHAT WAS AT A CONDITION OF

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:34.525
ANOTHER COMMITTEE OR YOU KNOW

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:35.593
WHAT LET LET ME DO THIS LET LET

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.031
ME -- LET ME GO BACK AND TALK.

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:40.765
TO PART OF ME TEARS AS HE

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:41.399
THERE'S ANYBODY TO CHANGE THAT

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:42.900
BUT I MEAN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.168
YEAH YOU SHOULD BE AND I DON'T

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:45.403
KNOW IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.138
IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT THE

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:48.740
PC DOES NOT NEED.

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:49.941
TO AND I WANT TO SAY THIS FOR

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:50.575
THE RECORD I SHOULD SAID THIS

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.076
EARLIER THE PC DOES NOT HAVE TO

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:54.746
COLLECT UP TO THAT AMOUNT -- THE

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.414
POINT FIVE DAY COULD ALSO REDUCE

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:57.548
THE AMOUNT SO THERE'S SOME

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.017
FLEXIBILITY THERE AS WELL -- BUT

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.619
I THINK I THINK ALSO SOMETIMES A

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:02.954
THE SUNSETS ARE ARE DONE SO THAT

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:03.621
WE COULD TAKE A LOOK BACK AT A

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:06.391
PROGRAM -- IN IN RE VISIT THOSE

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.526
OF THOSE AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS AS

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.127
WELL THAT'S NOT MY INTENT BUT

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:10.561
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A NUMBER OF

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:11.296
REASONS I FIGURED I WOULD BOTH

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.497

RIGHT I CAN APPRECIATE THAT.

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:16.461
HERE'S ONE THING.

00:33:16.527 --> 00:33:17.395
WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT SOME OF

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:18.062
THE TECHNOLOGY AND I TO THE TIME

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:20.198
TO GO SEE IT REVIEW IT AND YOU

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:21.265
LOOK AT HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:22.767
CHANGED I MEAN WE WOULDN'T WANT

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:25.403
TO LIMIT -- WHAT WE THINK IS THE

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.839
BEST -- THE BEST EQUIPMENT NOW

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.073
WHEN SOMETHING BETTER CAN COME

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.675
DOWN THE FUTURE SO YOU WOULD

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.176
NEED TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT --

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:33.978
THOSE DOLLARS THE THE THE OTHER

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.346
QUOTE THE OTHER ISSUE TOO IS

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:38.082
THAT -- I HOPE IT'S NOT THE CASE

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.317
BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.818
TRADITIONALLY IT HAS BEEN THAT

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:42.820
THE POPULATION WHO NEED THESE

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:45.656
SERVICES GROW GROWS -- AND SO

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:46.791
YOU WOULD WANT TO LIMIT IT

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:47.725
LIMITED BECAUSE FUTURE

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:52.029
GENERATIONS -- MAY NEED A BIGGER

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.399

EQUIPMENT AND SO FORTH -- IT'S

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.035
WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I SAY

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.737
THAT WE ACTUALLY MAY HAVE A MORE

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.172

OF DISABILITIES AND OR NEEDS OR

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:07.645
CONDITIONS -- IT PAINS ME TO SAY

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.980
THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:13.718

DECIDE ONCE THEY SAW THE BILL

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:10.821

NOT DO IT ANYMORE.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.090

CONCERN THANK YOU OKAY --

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:24.987
MEMBERS TO HAVE ANYTHING

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:25.288

YEAH THANKS -- CAN CAN WE GET A

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.159
LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON THAT

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:33.496
PARTICULAR ISSUE WHAT WHAT THE

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:37.667
THE FEED YOUR RECORDED IN FEET

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:38.901
POWER BACK TO THE GREAT IF

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:39.669
YOU'RE SURE TO CALL THE POINTS

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.471
LIKE A DEMAND RESPONSE KIND OF

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.540
FRAMEWORK -- HASN'T EXPLAINED

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.475

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:49.812
PLANNING.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.680
AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.114
INSURE THAT BECAUSE IT IS

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.716
LIMITED FUNDING AND IT'S ONLY

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:54.216
FOR ONE YEAR.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.185
AND THERE ARE MANY OF FACILITIES

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:57.787
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE HERE THAT

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:58.888
WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THOSE

01:05:58.954 --> 01:05:59.955
FACILITIES ARE PRETTY WITHIN THE

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.324
COMMUNITY AND THE BLACK

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.558
COMMUNITY ITSELF SHOULD ALSO.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.260
IF WE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:05.127
TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.028
COORDINATING AND PLANNING ALONG

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.263

AND SEVEN SEVEN FOUR AROUND THE

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:11.567

I THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:19.842
PUZZLE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:20.376
OUT WITH.

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:23.779

OUR COMMITTEES POWERLESS.

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.018

FROM MY CONVERSATION A CALLOW

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.158
YES WE'RE IN THE THOUSANDS AT

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:37.426
LEAST.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.694
GIVE A SENSE DO WE HAVE A SENSE

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.363
OF SCALE HERE LIKE IN TERMS OF

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.031
VULNERABILITY EVEN FOR THIS

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.232
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DO WE

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:47.136
YET KNOW THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM.

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:48.704
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE FUNDING

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.839
INTO THIS PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.207
GOING INTO THE FUTURE I MEAN

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:51.874
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.109
PREVENT SOME OF THE ESTATE MONEY

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.677
FROM BEING USED THIS IS AND THIS

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:57.146
IS A GUARANTEED AT LEAST 10% OF

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.447
IT WILL GO TOWARDS IS CRITICAL

01:06:58.514 --> 01:06:59.615
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S NOTHING.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.816
TO PREVENT MORE OF IT FROM GOING

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.985
TOWARDS THAT BUT I THINK IF THE

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.086
COMMENT IS THAT WE COULD USE

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:05.921
MORE RESOURCES TO GO INTO THESE

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:07.690

TO TAKE THAT ENTIRE POT WHICH

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:17.666

TRY TO SOLVE THIS RESILIENCY

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.338
PROBLEM WRIT LARGE WITH IT SO I

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:22.972
THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.206
GET CREATIVE ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.608
