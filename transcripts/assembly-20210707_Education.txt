A PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SIX NINETY TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION INCLUSION ACT. THE BILL CENTERED AROUND THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUITY IN OUR SCHOOL CLASSROOMS AND- FORMED A PARTNERSHIP IN NUMEROUS PARENTS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS. SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPERTS TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. INCLUSION FOR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OR ENGAGE WITH THEIR PEERS IN GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOMS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATE TO INCREASE ACADEMIC GRADUATION OUTCOMES FOR NOT ONLY SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. BUT ALL STUDENTS. STATES THAT HAVE INCREASED INCLUSION L. R. E. RATES OVER THE LAST DECADE INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA HAVE SEEN PARALLEL INCREASES IN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. CALIFORNIA'S RATE OF INCLUSION IS LOW IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES. IN ALMOST BUT NO PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION FOR STUDENTS IN THE LAST DECADE. ONLY 53% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SPENT A MAJORITY OF THEIR SCHOOL THEN A GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM. THAT'S WELL BELOW OUR NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 63% ABOUT A 10% DIFFERENCE. BY ADDING AN EXISTING FEDERAL INCLUSION OR LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT TARGET HOPE WHICH IS THE ACRONYM IS EARLIER. TO EXISTING STATE ACCOUNTABILITY A TO THE DASHBOARD FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND AWARENESS OF INCLUSION OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HELP TO ALIGN TO FRAGMENTED ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY APPLY TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND DISINCENTIVE EYES DISTRICT FROM INAPPROPRIATELY PLACING THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS INTO SEGREGATED CLASSROOMS THAT BEING SAID. IT SHOULD BE CLARIFIED THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THAT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERY STUDENT MAY NOT BE THE GENERAL EDUCATION SETTINGS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM I E. P. THAT TEAM AND THE FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE. THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT. OF A STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES. THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO OFFER MORE INCLUSIVE OPTIONS TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES INCENTIVIZE DISTRICTS TO USE EXISTING RESOURCES TO PROVIDE GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WITH TRAINING. AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON TEACHING STRATEGIES AND FRAMEWORKS OPTIMIZE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS. WITH INDIVIDUAL LEARNING DIFFERENCES. SB SIX NINETY TWO. WILL THEREBY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE THROUGH INCLUSION TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S VALUES OF INCLUSION UNDERSTANDING AND EQUITY. BEFORE INTRODUCED BY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT AMENDMENTS WERE MADE- IN THE SENATE IN PARTNERSHIP MANY ADVOCATES ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERS FOR TAKING THE DEAF. AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY THE BLIND COMMUNITY AND THE DEAF BLIND COMMUNITY. SUMMER HERE TODAY WILL ALSO BE TESTIFYING. THEY WILL BE PROVIDED TESTIMONY AS I UNDERSTAND IT WITH THE NEUTRAL STANCE THESE PRIOR AMENDMENTS WERE MADE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND SERVED ME CLARIFICATIONS TO ADDRESS OUR INITIAL CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BILL. I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALTER pOF HEARING BLIND OR DEAF BLIND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. NOR WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS OUR SPECIALTY PROGRAMS THAT SERVE LOW INCIDENT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THOSE PRIOR AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE BILL CLARIFY THIS. ALSO ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY THIS COMMITTEE THAT ARE LISTED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. THESE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY HOW THE NEW INDICATOR WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD. TO ENSURE A FULL PICTURE IS BEING PAINTED ON THE STUDENTS BEING SERVED WITH ADEQUATE CONTEXT GIVEN AND I WANT TO JUST EXTEND- A LITTLE OFF SCRIPT MY HEART FULL. OF GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR FOR SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WITH ME PERSONALLY- AS WELL AS- COMMITTEE STAFF. WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF THE TO TRY TO GET THE LANGUAGE EXACTLY RIGHT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT AND I AND I THINK WE'VE DONE THAT HERE. WITH ME TODAY IS DR MERION TO WANT THE SENECA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND KEVIN SCHAEFER DIRECTOR OF THE SUPPORTING INCLUSION PRACTICES PROJECT. OF IT WHICH IS PART OF THE- ARTICLE ELDORADO COUNTY OFFICE EDUCATION. ALSO TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOTH. THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN I GO TO THE PHONES FOR EACH WITNESSES THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES OF WITH TWO MINUTES EACH. YOU MAY PROCEED DR MARIANNE- THE. ONE GOOD MORNING I'M BACK TO MARION TO ONE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. CRAFTED BURNT THERE SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO AND WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP APPRECIATION TO SENATOR CORTES DE FOR BRINGING FORWARD THAT SPARTAN THOUGH THAT PRIORITIZES EQUITY AND INCLUSION WHICH ARE CORD COLORS OF OUR OFFICE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION. I STARTED MY CAREER AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER AND HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THAT INCLUSION CHANGES THAT YOUR DIRECTORY A STUDENT BY. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE INCLUDED AND GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP PACE WITH PEERS GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE A SUCCESSFUL CAREER. OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES EXTERIOR BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCLUSION AND ACADEMIC GRADUATION AND EMPLOYMENT SUCCESS. YET CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION. CALIFORNIA ONLY REGULARLY INCLUDES ABOUT 53% OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES FAR BELOW THE NATIONAL RATE. SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT A 100% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BE INCLUDED A 100% OF THE TIME. IT WOULD ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS OFFER MORE INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS TO STUDENTS WITH EIGHTY. WE BELIEVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND ARE DESERVING OF EQUAL DIGNITY AND INCLUSION WITH THEIR PEERS. WE URGE YOU TO JOIN US BY VOTING YES ON SENATE BILL SIX NINETY TWO. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN SCHAEFER DIRECTOR OF EQUITY AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES FOR THE SUPPORTING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES PROJECT WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I ALONG WITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KRISTEN BROOKS ADMINISTER THE PROJECT THROUGH THE EL DORADO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION RESPECTIVELY. OUR MISSION TO SUPPORT LEADERSHIP IN THEIR INTENTIONAL DESIGN AND REDESIGN INCREASE MEANINGFUL INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION INDICATOR FIVE EGG WHICH IS AT THE CENTER OF THE BILL. ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO I WAS A STUDENT THAT THAT. WHO EXPERIENCE EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES AS WELL AT THE AFTER ABOUT. FIFTY YEARS AGO AND STILL FAR TOO OFTEN WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IT SEGREGATED SETTINGS CANCEL END. EVEN TODAY ROUGHLY HALF OF THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE EDUCATED IN SEPARATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. DEFECTOR IN MOST CASES NEGATIVELY CAN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND LIMITED CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. WE MUST DO BETTER AT DOING BETTER INCLUDE ADDING INDICATOR FIVE EIGHT LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT DATA AT THE REQUIRED AND TRANSPARENT MEASURE ON THE CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTABILITY DASHBOARD. BUT STILL ALLOWS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL I PLEASE MAKE THE DECISIONS MADE BY IDT TEAMS COULD BE FRONT AND CENTER AS OPPOSED TO AN ABLEIST AFTERTHOUGHT WICKS I LOOKED DISTRICT PLANNING CONVERSATION. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THE INCLUSION. EXCEPT MY CAREER TO CREATING AN INCLUSIVE LEARNING SPACE OF ALL STUDENTS THE DARK. REMEMBER THAT SEPARATE IS NOT EQUAL- I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB. SIX NINETY TWO THANK YOU. THANK MMHM I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A WITNESSES IN OFFICE TO THIS WE DO HAVE ONE THAT WANTS TO EXPLAIN THEIR NEUTRAL POSITION TODAY. AND THAT IS- SHERRY FOR HEARING FOLLOW HEARING HER INA I BELIEVE I SAID THAT CORRECTLY- SO YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THROUGH AN INTERPRETER. THE TECHNICIANS. SAN RACE DAY THERE FROM QUESTIONS. THE. TWO I. DON'T THINK. WE CANNOT. OKAY. GOOD MORNING. I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AND AGENCIES SERVING THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING AS WELL AS THE- ORGANIZATION OR TEACHERS OF THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CALLED CAL ED. WE CHANGED OUR POSITION FROM A OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL ONCE THAT THIS BILL WAS AMENDED TO ADD THE EXCEPTION FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATORS TO UNDERSTAND A FEW MAIN REASONS. THIS BILL SITES. A SINGLE FEDERAL INDICATOR FIVE A BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT A COMPLIANCE INDICATOR IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT THERE ARE ALSO NINETEEN OTHER INDICATORS. MY SECOND MAIN REASON IS TOO MANY DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY MAINSTREAM WITHOUT ADEQUATE SUPPORT WITHOUT EDUCATORS AND PEERS. AND REGULAR EDUCATION AND BEING ABLE TO COMPLETELY COMMUNICATE AND THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE. WHETHER IT IS ENGLISH OR AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. EDUCATIONAL PLACEMENTS NEEDS TO BE BASED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT STUDENT NOT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE SYSTEM OR FOR MEETING IN L. R. E. QUOTA. WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF LANGUAGE DEPRIVATION AMONG DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN. AND STUDENTS WERE NOT MEETING THEIR ACADEMIA DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIERS. WHICH IS KEY THE WORLD FEDERATION FOR THE DEAF PRESIDENT RECENT STATEMENT RELATED TO THE EDUCATION OF DEAF STUDENTS. QUOTES INCLUSION IS AN EXPERIENCE IT IS A HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE IT IS NOT A PLACEMENT END QUOTE. EVERY STUDENT IN THE CLASSROOM WHO CAN EXPERIENCE FULLY FREE FLOWING COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THEIR TEACHERS THAT'S INCLUSION. MANY MANY DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING STUDENTS ARE ISOLATED IN REGULAR CLASSROOMS ONLY RECEIVING ONE HOUR A WEEK OF ITINERANT SERVICES THAT IS NOT INCLUSION. LASTLY WE NEED A BILL THAT WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE EDUCATION OF DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN IN THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THE TERMINAL DONNA. GERMAN ARE DONE YES- IF WILL WILL GO TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW. IF SO MISTER BENNETT I COULD JUST MAKE OF A PERSONAL COMMENT. OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH. AND HE WAS MAINSTREAMED AND HE SUFFERED GREATLY SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE THE DEAF ORGANIZATION OF STANDING UP FOR THE UNIQUE REASONS WHY THERE NEED TO BE THIS EXCLUSION THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH ME IN MY OFFICE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WHEN YOU WALKED IN MY OFFICE- BUT I CAME TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM YOU HAVE A GREAT PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE. BUT YOU CARE HE REALLY DO CARE ABOUT THIS WE SEE A LOT OF BILLS WERE MAYBE PEOPLE AREN'T INVESTED BUT YOU'RE REALLY INVESTED IN THIS BILL HE DID A GREAT JOB AND I KNOW WE HAD SOME CONCERNS- REALLY MY MAIN CONCERN COMES AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. ALONG THE LINES OF PROBABLY WHAT I'D LABELED RECIPROCAL ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT BECAUSE JUST JUST JUST PUTTING STUDENTS SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS INTO A CLASSROOM. THAT IS AN INCLUSION RIGHT- THEY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED THE STUDENT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED AND THE TEACHER NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED OR AS AS BEEN ALLUDED TO THAT STUDENTS GOING TO BE ALONE IN THAT CLASSROOM THAT WAS VIEWED ONE WAY THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS AND YOURS TOO WE WERE GREETED WORK ON THAT GOING FORWARD. HOW DO WE BUILD THAT INTO POLICY- I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE I STILL GO BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND SUB- AS A TEACHER AND I WAS IN A CLASSROOM MODE I DID SOME LAST YEAR THE YEAR PRIOR WHERE ONE OF THE PERIOD SAID THAT WHAT THEY CALL INCLUSION. BUT A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THERE WERE SPECIAL NEEDS WELL THAT WAS AROUND THE INCLUSION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE IS NO SUPPORT. FOR THE STUDENTS OR THE TEACHER IN THAT CLASSROOM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT SO THAT WE BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE A AND I CNVERSATIONS. ABOUT GOING FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR THE BILL- WITHOUT ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS. OF COURSE OR- WHEN YOU GET TEACHER. ON THAT THE- A COMMITTEE HERE WE ALL HAVE SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCES BUT- I TO WHO HAVE TAUGHT IN KATIE- SIX FOR. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. HAVE HAD MANY STUDENTS THAT WERE MAINSTREAM DAN- MOSTLY- WHAT AUTISTIC STUDENTS BUT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN- I THINK THE PUBLIC IS AWARE. FOR TEACHERS TO DO THE BEST JOB CAN. UP WITH THIRTY TWO TH THREE FOUR STUDENTS. ARE AN THEN TO HAVE A STUDENTS WITH NEEDS I HAVEN'T A TEACHER THAT. DID LITTLE FOR FEW THINGS OUT OF THE BOX LIKE PLAYED A LOT OF MUSIC AND POETRY AND HAVE THE MOVE AROUND AND SOME OF THE PARENTS TOLD ME THEY THRIVE BUT THERE'S OTHER TIMES WHERE PARTICULARLY WITH TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE SITTING IN A CLASS AND MANY TIMES POWER POINTS AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES- AND IT'S VERY QUIET PLACE AND THEY CAN. VERY EASILY. HEY AND I'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT- TEACHERS DO A GREAT JOB BUT IT IS HARD TO MEET ALL OF THOSE NEEDS IN ONE CLASSROOM BUT THE BIGGEST THING I SAW IS THE SUPPORT STAFF AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD TRY. SOMETIMES YOU WOULD GET THIRTY MINUTES. THAT FOR THAT ONE STUDENT WHO DIDN'T HIRE DAY AND SOMETIMES THEY'D WALK IN AND YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SO I APPRECIATE YOUR REALLY FOCUSING ON THIS BECAUSE- WE WANT TO DO THE BEST FOR KIDS AND WE WANT TO DO. ALL WE CAN BUT WITH ONE TEACHER TYPICALLY AND A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TIME SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS DO IT THE RIGHT WAY SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. GREAT SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE NOW GOING TO GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT- TEN MINUTES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION FROM IN THE ROOM ON THE PHONE AND AT THE STATION IN CAPITOL PARK.

IT'S BEEN. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. THE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL BY DONAL I HIGHLY HIGHLY I'D BENNETT BENNETT I DALLY. DALLY I LEE. MCCARTY CORK SILVA PHOTO BY FIVE OF THOSE FIVE- TODAY'S OUT THANK YOU SENATOR OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN I THINK CENTER LATER THIS YEAR. ALEXANDER LAMONT'S. RIGHT BOETTCHER RIGHT THERE. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS OF WE ARE ON DISNEY AND JOB WE ARE ON A. FILE ITEM SO FILE I SO- A. FIFTY THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AS A WORKING MOTHER WITH AN INFANT I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH HEALTH CARE OPTIONS MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FACE THE SAME STRUGGLES CURRENTLY UR SYSTEM IS ONLY SERVING 10% OF ELIGIBLE INFANTS AND TODDLERS THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR CHILD CARE AND SB FIFTY WILL ADDRESS INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE CHILDREN FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO MAKE ANY CHANGES BUT DOES ALLOW HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PARENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY THIS BILL WILL OPEN UP THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO YOUNGER CHILDREN BY OPENING UP THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO CHILDREN EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS WE CAN SERVE MORE UNDERSERVED TODDLERS ADDITIONALLY SB FIFTY WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO ENROLL AND STEAMROLLED IN CHILD CARE IT EASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PARENTS AND PROVIDERS BY ESTABLISHING TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY AND ALLOWING FOR SOME STREAMLINED ELIGIBILITY. IF A PRENT CAN SIT THERE AND ROLLED IN PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE HEALTH HEALTH FIRST WEEK AND HEAD START THEY WILL BE PRESUMED ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE TODAY- WE HAVE ANDREA FERNANDES FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S ACADEMY AND NINA OF BEAUTY FROM A EVERY TELL CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. TO OUR FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA FERNANDEZ THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S ACADEMY A PRIVATE NONPROFIT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE CENTER BATES I DON'T BUY A DIRECT CONTRACTOR WE SERVE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED INCIDENTS FATHERS SOME PRESCHOOLERS ARE FULL DAY FULL YEAR PROGRAM AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY. THE CHANGES THAT THE FIFTY PROPOSES TO MAKE IT TO THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA STATE CRITICAL SYSTEM WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HELP FAMILIES ACCESS SERVICES IN FAMILIES OF ALREADY BEEN APPROVED FOR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE CALFRESH THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR SERVICES BY PROVIDING PROOF OF THAT AWARD. CURRENTLY OUR FAMILIES IN THE PROVIDE THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH EACH PROGRAM HAVING TO CERTIFY THE FAMILY SEPARATELY THIS CREATES A BARRIER FOR THE FAMILIES WHO MAY HAVE TO GATHER NEW DOCUMENTATION EACH AND EVERY TIME AND THEN WAIT WHILE EACH PROGRAM WORKS TO CONFIRM THAT THE DOCUMENTATION IS VALID. ONCE THIS BILL BECOMES LAW A FAMILY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CERTIFIED ONE TIME AND BE ELIGIBLE. FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING OURS. I'M WITH THE BE ABLE USE THAT THIRD OF THE- AT PROOF OF THE ALLEGED. I EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW HELPFUL THIS WOULD BE TO OUR FAMILIES. ARE LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF COLOR FACE MORE OBSTACLES THAN MANY OF US REALIZE. THE TIME IT TAKES TO GATHER ALL THE DOCUMENTS NEEDED DELAYED SERVICES THAT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN SO DESPERATELY NEED. IN ADDITION THE EXTENSION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD WOULD ALSO GREATLY HELP THE FAMILIES ACCESS AND MAINTAIN THEIR SERVICES. THIS WOULD PROVIDE STABILITY FOR BOTH THE FAMILY AND THE CHILDREN WHO WOULD NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GET CARE OR WORRY ABOUT LOSING THEIR CARE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BOTH OF THESE CHANGES WOULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT PROGRAMS LIKE MINE AS WELL. SAVING HOURS OF CLERICAL WORK IN ADMINISTRATIVE TIME AND DOLEFUL IMPROVING PARENT PROGRAM RELATIONSHIP. FINALLY EXPANDING PPD INCLUDE CHILDREN STARTING AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD IS ANOTHER WAY TO HELP THE FAMILIES ACCESS SERVICES. FAMILIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN PLEASE SUMMARIZING CONTRACT. YES I PLEDGE TO FIND THAT THE COUPLE THE WAY THE SB FIFTY WOULD REMOVE FOR FAMILIES AND PROVIDE WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF YOUNG CHILDREN PASSING SB FIFTY WOULD ULTIMATELY ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN IN QUALITY PRO. YOU STRENGTHENED. THANK GOOD JOB GOOD JOB TO RETORT YOU HAVEN'T YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS I BELIEVE YEAH. THIS MOVIE I BILLION. YES GOOD O'DONNELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS NINA CRISTIAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AVERAGE HOW CALIFORNIA A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SIXTEEN HUNDRED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS WERE ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL SB FIFTY WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SUBSIDIZED IT WITH THEM AND ENABLE PROVIDERS TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY TODDLERS WHICH IS WHERE WE SEE THE GREATEST UNMET NEEDS. WE KNOW THAT QUALITY CHILDCARE DURING THE EARLIEST YEARS OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SUCH A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE LEARNING AND SIX THAT THERE'S A LARGE UNMET NEED WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS ACCORDING TO THE EARLY LEARNING CARE MASTER PLAN ONLY ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND ENROLLED IN THE STATE'S WEBSITE. SURE THE MORE THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING A CARRIAGE OVERLY COMPLEX AND UNCOORDINATED SB FIFTY TRIED TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE BY REMOVING BARRIERS FOR PROGRAMS AND FAMILIES AT THE PREVIOUS WITNESS MAJORITY STATED ADDITIONALLY SB FIFTY WOULD OPEN UP THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO SERVE CHILDREN EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS RATHER THAN ONLY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS- THIS WOULD PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN ONCE THEY SERVE ALL ELIGIBLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. AND I SOMETIMES CONTACT NEEDS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES OF FAMILIES BY PROVIDING THE FLEXIBILITY TO SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN- ABOUT MAINTAINING QUALITY TITLE FIVE STANDARDS IN AGE APPROPRIATE RATIOS IT WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PROGRAMS TO FULLY EXPAND OUR CONTACTS AND SERVE THE CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. SB FIFTY ALSO ALLOWS PROVIDERS TO BE REIMBURSED BASED ON CHILD INVOLVEMENT RATHER THAN ATTENDANCE PROVIDING MORE STABILITY AND ENABLING PROVIDERS TO FULLY UTILIZE THEIR CONTRACT FUNDS TO SERVE CHILDREN RATHER THAN RETURNING FUNDS TO THE STATE ADDITIONALLY SB FIFTY WOULD ALLOW FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO SERVE CHILDREN AND STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH WE THINK IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY COULD PROVIDE MORE CHOICES FOR PARENTS I'M MORE STABILITY FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- ADDITIONALLY AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THERE'S CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY WHICH MAKES IT EASIER. FOR FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS BY REDUCING BURKE IN SOME PAPERWORK BUT HAD. ELIGIBLE AND LYFT BUT NOT LEAST SB FIFTY AFTER A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM WERE MADE INCOME WORKING FOR. CAN TWENTY MONTHS. FOR CHILD CARE. SO THE THEY CONTINUE TO WORK CHILDREN BE IN A STATE HIGH. AND FOR THESE REASONS URGE YOUR- FOR. FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE A THERE'S NO OPPOSITE- WHAT WILL DO NOW IS WILL GO TO THE- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MISTER MCCARTY MISTER MISTER CHILD CARE RIGHT THERE- CHILD- WHAT EARLY AND GUY GO FOR. PRE K. EARLY AT EARLY LEARNING IT'S ALL GOOD IT'S ALL MCCARTY NO I DON'T FEEL EVERYBODY IN THIS IS THIS THAT THE POINT IS THIS IS PART OF A- OF A PACKAGE OF MEASURES. AND BUDGET ALLOCATIONS WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ACCESS FOR NOT JUST PRE K. FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BUT FOR ZERO THREE THREE AND THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. AND I THINK ONE KEY POINT TWO IS TOO OFTEN YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR PARENTS TAKE. THEIR INCOME ELIGIBLE BUT WE MAKE HIM GET THIS FORM AND THAT FORM LAST YEAR TAP TAXES. AND POVERTY IS POVERTY IS VERY- CONFINEMENT AND WE'RE OUT OF WAYS TO SHOW.

ALL RIGHT ARE YOU READY CHAIR EVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU GOODBYE MR CHU GOOD MORNING MEMBER. SB TWO FORTY SIX THE CHAU CARE SO OF THE RIGHT WITH A STEP IS REGIONALI REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES. THE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS IT HAS TWO SEPARATE ADELINE SYSTEM FOR REIMBURSING PROVIDERS THAT MEET TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS. EXISTING BIFURCATED SYSTEM AND IN A QUITE INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO FUND TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THAT MEET THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN BEING SERVED. THE CENTRE LINE TO SYSTEM APPROACH LIMITS ACCESS BILLS TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM QUALITY NEWS FORCING MANY CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. OUT OF BUSINESS AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WE LOST THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CURRENT RATE SYSTEM RESOURCE EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AND EXPANDED IN THE WAY THAT ONE. COMPENSATE TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THREE RECOGNIZE THE COST OF MEETING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS AND FOR INCENTIVIZE HIGH STANDARDS AND PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH BASED. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST ONE IN NINE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE THESE SERVICES. HOWEVER THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED WITH THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND I HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES SPECIFICALLY THAT CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL. TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND FOR WOMEN TO BE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN OUR WORKFORCE. I HAVE OPERATE REFORM FOR THREE YEARS NOW AND MORE THAN EVER IS THE TIME TO RESTRUCTURE HOW WE REIMBURSE PROVIDERS TO ALLOW THEM TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN. WE ALL DEPEND ON THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO LONG AS OVER DO. SO AS LONG OVERDUE THAT WE DO THE RIGHT THING THROUGH THESE REFORMS CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND MAXIMIZE PUBLIC BENEFIT. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INTRODUCE NEED EMPATHY WITH EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA AND MONIQUE RAMOS WITH FIRST FIVE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOUR TO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. MORNING MONEY GRANDMA ABOUT HALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA A CO SPONSOR OF SB TWO FORTY SIXTH. INFORMAL CARE THE PART OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FAMILY SELECTED THEY ARE BALANCING WORK AND WORK AND PARENTING IN CALIFORNIA WE REFER TO THAT LEASES LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS OR FRIEND AND FAMILY NEIGHBOR CARE. MOST PARENTS IF NOT ALL USE THIS CARE FOR THE REGULAR PART OF THEIR LIVES. THESE CARETAKERS ARE OFTEN GRANDMOTHERS AUNTS NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY FRIENDS UNFORTUNATELY THE SUBSIDIZE THE STEM. HAVE THE EMBARRASSINGLY ROAD LOW RATES FOR LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS THESE PROVIDERS HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RATE INCREASE IN THE TEN YEARS PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEN DURING THE GREAT RECESSION FACED A 30% REDUCTION. FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES MANY OF WHOM WORK NONTRADITIONAL HOURS IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES THESE ARE THE ONLY CARE THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS. TO HIGHLIGHT ONE PROBLEM WITH OUR CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATES SYSTEM. WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AN EXAMPLE FROM THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. A FULL TIME RENDON FAMILY NEIGHBOR PROVIDER WHO PROVIDES CARE FOR SCHOOL AGED CHILD IN THE EVENING. IF PAID TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS AN HOUR. WE BELIEVE THESE RATES ARE NOT ONLY UNFAIR BUT UNSUSTAINABLE AND BY NOT INCREASING RATES WE WILL LOSE A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WILLING TO PROVIDE CARE STEPS THAT FAMILIES WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM IMPROVISE IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL PROVIDERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN NO DIALOGUE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS NINA THINKING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SIXTEEN HUNDRED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS ALSO A PROUD CO SPONSOR SB TWO FOUR SIX AS OUTLINED AND THREE TWO FOUR SIX OFFER SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE BIFURCATED RATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM N CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS TO BREAK THIS DOWN FOR SOME SITES EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS THE XR OR THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS ONE STEP RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE AND THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE WHICH ACCOUNTS. FOR SOME GEOGRAPHIC AND REGIONAL CALL. OKAY CAN ACCOUNT SERVICES AS OUR CHILL SIR LITTLE. BIT BY OKAY SISTER COMPLICATES REIMBURSED SYSTEM. I S. R. IS ONE WHERE ADJUSTED FOR. WELL R. MARGARITA RIGHT WITH NO. ADJUSTMENT WE ARE TRYING TO CONFRONT SIMPLE THE POP AND- A- RATE THAT WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES. THIS NEW RATE STRUCTURE WILL INCLUDE ALLSTATE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS THE FOUNDATION OF WHICH IS MODERN FATHER MODERNIZED STRUCTURE IS CALLED THE BASE RATE. WHEN FULLY PHASED IN THE BASEMENT WILL WILL REPLACE BOTH THE EXIST RATE STRUCTURES AND WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL PROGRAM TYPES. THE BASE RATE WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR MARKETS AND BALANCE REFLECT DIFFERENT COST OF LIVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR LIKE THE PROGRAM YEAR FOR PROVIDER TYPE HOURS OF SERVICE AND CHARACTERISTIC OF CHILDREN SERVED. THE BASE RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY EDUCATION AND WILL BE INCREASE ANNUALLY. THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT RATE WILL ALSO INCENTIVIZE QUALITY AND PARTICIPATION IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH A QUALITY FACTOR. THIS WILL ENCOURAGE ALL PROVIDERS REGARDLESS OF PROGRAM TYPE BETWEEN RICH THAT PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS AND PAY FOR THE INCREASED COSTS AND FEES AFTER SIX BLOCKS TO THE FULLEST I WISH I KNEW CRISIS FACTOR WHICH CAN BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE SPONSORED CHILD CARE. EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS SERVING CHILDREN IN THE COUNTY EXPERIENCING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS MECHANISM CAN BE USED ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY OR STATEWIDE BASIS WHEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY AT THE CLARIDGE SAYS THAT SUCH AS WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES EXCEPT TRAP. THIS WOULD BE A SHORT TERM ADJUSTMENT FOR THE DURATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NEW RATE STRUCTURE PLEASE SUMMARIZE OF SIZE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. ALLOWING FOR UNIFIED WHAT LITTLE APPROACH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR LABOR HER FOR HER SUPPORT I URGE. AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WITH THERE ARE OFFICES WENT AS WERE THE CA MEMBERS THE QUESTION REMAIN IN THE MEMBER. I MISSED. THE BILL NEXT AND THEN JUST ADD A FEW COMMENTS. YEAH THIS IS AS SAID THIS IS BEEN A LONG.

SB FOURTEEN PHONE NUMBER TEN MISTER PORTANTINO THANK YOU FOR WAITING HEN. AND BEING HERE IN A TIMELY FASHION WE'VE DONE SOME WAITING TODAY BUT NOT FOR YOURSELF THANK YOU YOU MAY PERCEIVE AN ARRAY I DO THE BEST I CAN THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING US SENATORS DODD HUESO PAN RUBIO NUMBER. AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS LOW POWER QUE HAN CHAO CUNNINGHAM AND LEE MAIENSCHEIN AND CORK SILVA FOR BEING CO AUTHORS OF S. B. FOURTEEN. WHICH I BELIEVE IS A CRITICAL BILL TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. TO DEAL WITH THAT. AFTER EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND CONTINUING MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING OUR YOUTH ARE INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND DISENGAGED WITH DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. AT ALL AT AN ALL TIME HIGH FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT% OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEARLY ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SURVEYED. REPORTED FEELING SAD OR HOPELESS ALMOST EVERY DAY. TWO OR MORE WEEKS IN A ROW NEARLY ONE IN FIVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THIS CRISIS AND SHOULD BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY AND HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE SOONER PEOPLE GET HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CONCERNS. THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME. I SCHOOLS BEGINS TRANSITION INTO TO IN PERSON LEARNING IN A FEW MONTHS TEACHERS ARE BOUND TO BE FACED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES RESULTING FROM. THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THEIR STUDENTS SB FOURTEEN WOULD HELP ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM- EVER AS A READ FIRST. THE WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IN SHORT THAT STUDENTS ABSENCES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONCERNS ARE DEALT WITH ON PAR. WITH THE WAY SCHOOLS EXCUSE ABSENCES FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED THIS BILL WOULD HAVE SPOKEN DIRECTLY TO THE NEED OF MANY SCHOOL PERSONNEL WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM TRAINING. FOR IDENTIFY YOU THROUGHOUT THAT HAVE A BIGGER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MAKE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS SO THEY COULD GET THE HELP THEY NEED. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT WAS PROPOSED PRIOR TO PANDEMIC MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS TO BE TRAINED. SO WHY PUSH FORWARD WITHOUT THAT YOU KNOW FRANKLY. EVERY STEP FORWARD. IS INCREMENTAL TOWARDS DEEPENING THE STIGMATIZING MENTAL HEALTH BUT I ALSO THINK OF THE FATHER WHO CALLED IN TO TESTIFY WHEN I PRESENTED THIS BILL AND SENATE EDUCATION ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER WHO TURNED IN HER JOURNALIST SIMON. GOT A GRADE AND I TOOK HER OWN LIFE. THE FATHER DIDN'T BLAME THE TEACHER FOR NOT SEEING THE SIDES OF SUICIDE. BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE TEACHER WAS NOT TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE THEM. FRANKLY I BELIEVE THAT THAT TRAINING WILL SAVE LIVES MEMBERS WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND THE POLITICS AND FIND SOLUTIONS FOR YOUTH WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS. BY LEGALIZED FIGHT WITH LEGALIZING. MENTAL HEALTH ABSENCES AND REQUIRING CD TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PRACTICES AND TRAINING FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL. WE'RE TAKING A STEP FORWARD. AS I'VE SAID I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY A COALITION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES WHO HAVE TIRELESSLY WORKED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR TEACHER TRAINING. LED BY THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION LADY GAGA'S BORN THIS WAY FOUNDATION. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA NEXT IN CALIFORNIA AND IMPORTANTLY THE VOICES OF STUDENTS INCLUDING CHEN UP CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNCILS. AND CALIFORNIA STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS ASSOCIATION AS YOU CAN SEE. IN YOUR STAFF REPORT THE LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES ADVOCATES NONPROFITS IS VERY LONG AND SIGNIFICANT. WE NEED TO DO BETTER WE NEED TO GET THIS IN PLACE. AND WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND HELP OUR KIDS SO THEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY TODAY I HAVE ZACHARY PATTERSON PRESIDENT OF THE COALITION STUDENT BOARD MEMBER ASSOCIATION AND QUIRKY OVERWORK A TEACHER AT THE GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU MISTER PORTANTINO AND JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS RELUCTANTLY- I FRANKLY I YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU RELUCTANT WE CAN GO TO THE PHONES AND HOW TO MAKE IT CLEAR RELUCTANTLY I UNDERSTAND THAT I'VE HAD TO. ACCEPT MANY RELUCTANT OF IN AND OUT OF MY STUFF NOT AS A CAN DURING MY TENURE NOT AS A CONDITIONS OUT HERE EIGHT BUT NOT CONDITION TO GET A HEARING. JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR NOT AS A CAN I JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU ACCEPT AMOUNTS IT'S A ONE OUT A LITTLE ANSWER TO GET HERE. DO YOU DO ACCEPT THEM I DO ACCEPT THANK YOU SIR. BUT NOT AS BUT JUST SO I UNDERSTAND ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE AMOUNT NOW BUT I AND- THE ALL NEED UNDER. IT WITH THE CAN BE I COULD A HEARING WITH TWO X. THE AMOUNT THAT'S- I'VE HAD SAINTS. MYSELF TIMES IN THIS BILL YOU SHOULD OWN SO WITH THAT. LET'S GO TO THE- YOUR WITNESSES YOUR TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH TO EACH OF THE WITNESSES PLEASE THANK YOU. NO OPPOSITION. OKAY THERE'S. ZACHARY PATTERSON I BELIEVE IS ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT MR PATTERSON YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. ARE YOU THERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M HERE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL UNTIL MEMBERS MY NAME IS ZACHARY PATTERSON AND I SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF EDUCATION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AS A STUDENT A STUDENT WHO FEELS A STUDENT WHO STRUGGLES AND A STUDENT WHO KNOWS THAT MY MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS PHYSICAL HEALTH LIKE BREAKING A BONE OR FEELING SICK WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHY A SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU TODAY I THINK IT'S FIRST STUDENT AT MY SCHOOL JOHN. JOHN WAS MY CLASSMATE FELLOW TRACK RUNNER AND FRIEND I TRULY APPRECIATED JOHN FOR WHO HE WAS A BRAVE BOY WHO BRIGHTENED UP EVERYONE'S DAY DESPITE THIS THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNDERLYING THE INCESSANT JOKES ABOUT SUICIDE THE FREQUENT SADNESS THAT WOULD OVERCOME HIM. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I DID PUT MOST KIDS WOULD DO UNFORTUNATELY. I DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH. HELLO TWENTY TWENTY. MY DEAR FRIEND JOHN TOOK OWN LIFE. WE WERE ALL SHOCKED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE SIGNS. SIGNS THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNISED. I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO SUPPORT JOHN IF I HAD BEEN GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION TO DO SO. AND NOW. I'M HERE BECAUSE SB FOURTEEN IS MY CHANCE. IT'S OUR CHANCE. TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE JOHN'S. ACTUALLY TEACH STUDENTS IN A WARNING SIGNS AND HOW TO REACT TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. ACTUALLY VALUE MENTAL HEALTH WITH LEGITIMATE EXCUSED ABSENCES. AND TO TRAIN TEACHERS ON WHAT THEY NEED TO NOT ONLY HELP STUDENTS. BUT ALSO TO HELP EACH OTHER AS TEACHERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DAHLE SPACE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AS WELL. YOU CAN ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND REMOVING THE STIGMA AT SCHOOL IS THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TURNING THE TIDE IN SUPPORT OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE MADE STRIDES IN SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AND AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO OUR EXCITEMENT THE NEW CD YOU RESOURCES THROUGH THIS BILL THAT ARE FINALLY DEDICATED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT BOARD MEMBER ASSOCIATION I URGE THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. THE SHOW THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS AND VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. TO THE NEXT WITNESS. TO THE NEXT WITNESS CORE HE OVERCAME BELIEVE.

IF THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS THIS PAST FALL I HAD TO STUDENTS WITH DEPRESSION SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL IDEATIONS THEIR STRUGGLE WITH SO DEEP THAT THEY HAD INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES IN JUST COMPLETING ANY DAILY WORK. THEY WERE WITH THEIR PARENTS ALL DAY AND THEY MET WITH A THERAPIST ONCE A WEEK BUT WHO DID THEY CONFIDE IN. ME AND IN THAT MOMENT I NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT. I CLEARLY FELT INADEQUATE IN BEING TRAINED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS THE RIGHT THING. AS TEACHERS WE ARE MANDATED TO DO SEVERAL TRAININGS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SCHOOL YEAR. THE TEACHERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO BELIEVE THAT WE DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NEED MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS TRAINING. JUST THIS MONTH IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATOR MAGAZINE EDWEEK RESEARCH CENTER REPORTS THAT 92% OF EDUCATORS SAID TEACHING IS MORE STRESSFUL NOW. BEENPRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC NINETY TWO PERCENT. HOW DO YOU THINK THE STUDENTS FEEL. IN MAY AS GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM WAS ANNOUNCING A MAY REVISED TO THE BUDGET HE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING WE NEED TO DO MORE TO CARE FOR OUR TEACHERS WE NEED TO HAVE THEIR BACKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUR CHILDREN'S BACK.

AFP SILVA I'D- FLAWS SEVEN VOTES IT IS THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM. NUMBER TWELVE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE IT'S S. B. TWO TWO FOUR. YOU MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY CENTER I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING SENATORS RUBIO CORTESE TODD GLAZER HUESO HER TADO LAYERED NIELSEN- CHAU ABOVE SKINNER AND ON BURKE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BURKE FRAZIER CRISTINA GARCIA LACKEY MAIENSCHEIN WIN RODRIGUEZ AND SAN DIEGO SANTIAGO EXCUSE ME FOR ALL BEING CO AUTHORS OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO EXTEND MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION TO OUR K. TWELVE STUDENTS. HAS BEEN SAID MENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL TO OVER TO FOR THE OVERALL WELLBEING AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS UNRECOGNIZED UNTREATED OR LATE TREATED MENTAL HEALTH ELEVATES THE RISK OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SUCH AS SUICIDE AND SELF INJURY DIMINISHES PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY AND CAN CONTRIBUTE. TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER NEGATIVE COPING BEHAVIORS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING ONE IN FIVE YOU LIVE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. THAT WORKS TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION OF OUR KIDS THAT MAY NEED MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE NUMBERS ARE MORE DIRE FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LGBT Q. PLUS YOU LAST YEAR ONE IN THREE LGBTQ PLUS YOUTH REPORTED SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE. STIGMA IS ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO SEEKING HELP IN AS MANY ASONE HALF TO THREE QUARTERS OF CHILDREN DID NOT RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND EMPOWER STUDENTS TO SEEK HELP. BY REDUCING THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE SETTING FOR PROVIDING THIS EDUCATION TO OUR CHILDREN AS ANYBODY KNOWS WHO'S HAD A TEENAGER THEY CAN BE GREAT ADVOCATES FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE ARMED WITH INFORMATION- SO THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT SB TWO TO FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT PUPILS RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION FROM A QUALIFIED INSTRUCTOR. WILL HELP THEM IDENTIFY SIGNS OF SYMPTOMS OF A MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE HOW TO SEEK HELP TOO OFTEN THE GAP BETWEEN LIVING THROUGH YEARS OF DESPAIR AND SEEKING HELP IS SIMPLY HAVING THAT MAP TO GET THE HELP YOU NEED. SB TWO TO FOUR IS THAT MATT. I'M AMENDMENTS WE'VE BEEN WE DILIGENTLY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY. THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WE KNOW THE TEACHERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT UNDER COVERT. THEREFORE THE AMENDMENTS LIMITING LIMITING MENTAL HEALTH INSTRUCTION TO ONE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS THAT CURRENTLY OFFER HEALTH COURSE. BUT THE AMENDMENTS ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT THIS WILL LIMIT THE REACH OF THE BILL TO ABOUT GET THIS MENTAL HEALTH INSTRUCTION. THE MEMBERS ALSO STATE THAT AFTER THREE YEARS OF THIS PILOT AS IT WERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH INSTRUCTION STATEWIDE. FRANKLY MENTALLY HEALTHY MENTALLY HEALTHY STUDENTS EQUALS A MENTALLY HEALTHY CLASSROOM THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT MENTALLY UNHEALTHY STUDENTS WITH HIGHER DROP OUT AN ATTRITION RATES. MORE CLASSROOM DISCUSSIONS AND MORE KIDS LOST. IS YOUR ANALYSIS POINTED OUT WE LOST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR KIDS TO SUICIDE LAST YEAR LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR KIDS COMMITTED SUICIDE LAST YEAR EACH ONE OF THOSE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR LEAVES BEHIND A GALAXY OF LOVED ONES. STORIES LAUGHS AND POTENTIAL. WE'RE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. WHICH ONES WERE LIMITING THE REACH. TO GET THOSE KIDS WHO NEED OUR HELP. OUR FAMILIES DESERVE BETTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE GRADING JUST CONFIRMING YOU DOACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES RELUCTANTLY IN ORDER TO GET A HEARING. THANK YOU HAS ON FILE WITH THAT- WE CAN GO TO THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- WE HAVE- TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- IF THEY ARE ON THE LINE THEY MAY PROCEED WITH THE TESTIMONY TWO MINUTES.

YEAH SO MANY NEW TRACK WHERE I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT NETWORK WHERE PROGRAM A DENTAL HEALTH AMERICA CALIFORNIA- AND INTEGRATING MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS REALLY IMPAIRED AND- IT WOULD REACH THE MAJORITY BEGIN THANK JUSTIN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH AND TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF CRISIS AND APPEARS. REGARDLESS OF ANY STUDENTS RACE GENDER OR SOCIOECONOMIC LEVEL OR CULTURAL BACKGROUND RECEIVE MEDICALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM- HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE EXPERIENCING TRAUMA IN CALIFORNIA. AYDAN SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IT CAN LITERALLY TAKE YEARS OFF YOUR LIFE. ARE EXPERIENCING ADVERSE CHILD EXPERIENCES WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE- THAT WE'RE GETTING THREE KIDS YOUNG AND HELPING THEM. THE HOBBIT CAPABILITY TO BE HELPED AND IS THERE MENTAL ILLNESS AS THE ONLY PERSONALLY I WAS ONLY FOURTEEN WHEN I ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. I THINK YOU THREE HOURS AWAY TO OUR THREE MARKERS THAT WERE NOT BAD NEWS FOR EXAMPLE- AND I LOOK BACK AT THE TIME AND- WORD WE WERE JUST. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES I'VE RECEIVED THE ADVOCATE FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH. AND IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT. THE YOUTH VOICES SO VALUED BUT THE TRUTH IS I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE. MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES TO COLLECT SO MUCH OF MY CHILDHOOD. AND I'LL NEVER GET THAT TIME BACK WILL BE ABLE TO REPLACE. WHAT WAS LOST. WELL WE COULD GO DID OUR LETTUCE TRAINING- WITH LEGISLATORS. AND IT WAS CAME AFTER TEN AFTER CHAIRED. EACH SHARING THEIR SOME TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT THEY HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH ONE OF THEM HE SAID THAT HE WALKED OUT BECAUSE THE TREND. ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM SUICIDE. WORK YOUNG TO BE GRIEVING THE LOSS. OF OUR FRIEND AND OUR CHILDHOOD- BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT FAIR RIGHT. WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR A WORLD IN WHICH YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE HOW MUCH HER. FIGHT SO HARD TO HAVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BLANK. ON ME WE WILL KEEP PUSHING AND WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS JUST ONE STEP.

LEO COURSE- CLARK BELIEVE. YEAH GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LOW COST OF CLARK AND THE FORMER STUDENT BOARD MEMBER FOR ALL THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A MEMBER OF JENNIFER EXECUTIVE TEAM SB TWO NOW ALLIN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS A DEFENDER PREVIOUSLY SAID LAST YEAR IN CALIFORNIA WE LOST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS TO SUICIDE EACH ONE LEAVING BEHIND A HURTING COMMUNITY AND A GALAXY OF POTENTIAL. MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT EASY TO TALK ABOUT IT IT'S COMMON FOR THE YEAR THAT THE SENSITIVE GENERATION I'LL BE TOLD THAT THE STRESS IS JUST A NORMAL PART OF SCHOOL BUT IT'S COMMENTS LIKE THESE THAT REMIND ME OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS WHO WERE ONCE JUST LIKE ME THE SOURCE OF THE STATE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS BEYOND JUST STRESS SADNESS AND ISOLATION. IS THE RESULT OF COMPLACENCY AT THE STOMACH FILLING UP EVERY STEP THEM UP SUPPORT PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH IT IS A CALL TO ACTION TO DO BETTER WE CAN DO BETTER TODAY WITH SB TWO TO FORCE COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH CURRICULUM I SHOULD KNOW I WAS FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT OFFERS A MENTAL HEALTH CURRICULUM EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE PRESCRIBED THE SPELL. THROUGHOUT MY PEERS AND I BECAME MORE WILLING AND ABLE TO RECOGNIZE OUR OWN SYMPTOMS AND SEEK HELP AND BECAME BETTER EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT OUR FELLOW STUDENTS THAT'S WHY ANY GIVEN SCHOOL YOU'RE IN ALBANY OVER A QUARTER OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT POPULATION VOLUNTARILY SPEAKS OUT HELP FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PUBLIC COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL CURRICULUM GOES BEYOND JUST TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND COPE WITH THEIR SYMPTOS AND PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SUPPORT THAT LEGITIMIZES THEIR STRUGGLES WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND EMPOWERS THE TO SEEK HELP WITHOUT FEAR. REPLICATING THE SUCCESS WITH SB TWO TO FOUR IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT IS JUST THAT THE FIRST THAT WILL LIMIT THE WHOLE CURRICULUM IS PILOTED IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL HEALTH CLASSES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DEVELOP A PLAN TO EXPAND MY TO HELP TEACHING TO ALL SCHOOL LEVELS AND ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS ATTENTION AND SYSTEMIC SUPPORT AND THAT STARTS IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CURRICULUM ON BEHALF OF. CHEN UP AND STUDENTS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA I URGE THIS COMMITTEE VOTE IN. OF SB TWO TO FOUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING GO TO- AND IS OFFICE. AS JOE ALL.
