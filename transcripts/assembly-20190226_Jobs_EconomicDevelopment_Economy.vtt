TAKEN DOWN SO PEOPLE HAD MORE

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:39.103

BUT ALSO FEDERAL SPENDING ON

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.812
DEFENSE --

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:49.514
BUT STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.983
HIRING AND CAP EX IN OTHER FORMS

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:52.917
OF SPENDING IN THE STATE AND

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.486
LOCAL LEVEL ALSO WENT UP --

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:57.388
QUITE STRONGLY IN THE ONE AREA

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:58.189
OF THE ECONOMY THAT LOOKED LIKE

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:00.591
IT WAS ACTUALLY WEEK IN TWENTY

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.360
EIGHTEEN WAS HOUSING.

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.195
AND WE HAD SOME MORE DANGER OUT

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:04.962
TODAY SHOWING THAT HOUSING

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:06.964
STARTS WITH VERY WEAK TOWARD THE

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.199
END OF THE YEAR SO.

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:08.833
HOUSING IS CLEARLY AN AREA OF

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.835
THE ECONOMY THAT HAS SLOWED DOWN.

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:14.739
IN PASTA CANONIC CYCLES THIS A

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.874
CONCERN.

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.776
BUT IN THIS CYCLE WE'VE HAD SUCH

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.611
A SLOW RECOVERY A SLOW AND

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.179
MEASURED RECOVERY IN HOUSING.

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.915
WE HAVEN'T HAD --

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.651
AN EXCESSIVE USE OF MORTGAGE

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:30.021
DEBT FOR HOUSEHOLD EQUITY LINES

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.656
OF CREDIT THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:33.524
PAST CYCLE BUT BECAUSE THE WHOLE

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.092
ECONOMIC EXPANSION BLOW UP.

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.594
WE'VE HAD A MUCH MORE MAY SHOULD

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.162
IMPROVEMENT IN HOUSING A LOT OF

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:39.697
IT IS BEING IN THE MULTI SPACES

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.432
POST A SINGLE FAMILY.

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.134
AND SO --

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.768
THE SLOWDOWN RECENTLY IT'S BEEN

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.469
DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS ONE

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.737
IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.506
BEING SPENDING MORE RAISES

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.974
INTEREST RATES SO KIND OF CROWDS

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.742
OUT SOME OF THE ACTIVITY.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.311
IN HOUSING IS ALSO A BIG

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.645
SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.347
BY HOUSING --

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:58.082
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN JOB ADS IN

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:00.318
HOUSING A VERY STRONG YET THE

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:00.985
NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED HASN'T

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:01.819
GONE UP.

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:03.988
ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AND OTHER

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.623
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.425
GONE UP ABOUT 50% IN THE LAST

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:08.559
YEAR SO.

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:10.027
X. IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.562
HOUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO FIND

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:14.365
WORKERS AND HIGHER INTEREST

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.666
RATES OF COURSE TO SLOW DOWN.

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:19.270
BUT WE DON'T THINK THE SLOWDOWN

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:19.604
IN HOUSING --

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.974
IS THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.475
HOUSING COULD HAVE A BETTER YEAR

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:27.845
IN. TWENTY NINE TO TWENTY

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:28.379
EIGHTEEN AT IMPROVING THE

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:29.213
ECONOMY LAST YEAR.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.781
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATTER

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:31.849
THROUGH INTO FINANCIAL MARKETS

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.884
IN FACT THE STOCK MARKET HEADED

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:35.586
DOWN YEAR WHY IS THAT.

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:37.688
IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE THE

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:40.992
STOCK MARKET TENDS TO BE FORWARD

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.226
LOOKING SO.

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:43.127
WE DID HAVE A VERY GOOD --

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.562
A YEAR FOR THE ECONOMY TWENTY

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.330
SEVENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THE

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:48.766
MARKET SO WORRIED ABOUT TWENTY

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:49.867
NINETEEN BUT THE BOND AND THE

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:50.935
STOCK MARKET WHICH IS WHAT WE

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.937
LOOK. FOR THE RETURNS IN IN

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:55.339
CALPERS PORTFOLIO SO WHAT WHAT

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.008
ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT ONE

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.909
THING THAT AGAIN CHAIRMAN PAL.

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.645
MENTION TODAY IN THE SEMI ANNUAL

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.013
CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY.

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.982
WAS HAVE THE POLICIES AT THE

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:07.118
FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.653
LED TO A QUICK A RAIN TO THE

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.221
EXPANSION BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN THE

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:12.256
ECONOMY A SUGAR HIGH IN.

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:13.557
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR IS THERE A

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.259
SUPPLY SIDE REVOLUTION IT'S A

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.560
LOT OF THIS KIND OF DEBATES WE

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:17.962
WERE HAVING --

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:20.131
IN IN THE REAGAN YEARS IS THIS A

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:22.066
SUPPLY SIDE REFORM OR IS IT

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.934
ADVANCE SIDE.

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.770
AND SO.

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:26.637
A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE TO

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:27.838
LOOK AT IS LABOR FORCE

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.173
PARTICIPATION.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.741
LAST YEAR --

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.910
WE WE GOT A LOT MORE FOLKS

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.311
INTERESTED IN LOOKING FOR JOBS

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:37.114
WAGE RISES STARTED TO IMPROVE.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:39.316
AND SENTIMENT SURVEYS WERE

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:40.518
SHOWING SOME PEOPLE FELT VERY

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.552
COMFORTABLE THERE WERE PLENTY OF

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.421
JOBS OUT THERE FOR THEM.

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:44.555
AND THERE WAS ALSO A LOT MORE --

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:48.059
BECAUSE GOING ON THE ECONOMY AND

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.560
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE STARTED

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.728
TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THE

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.630
STRONG LABOR MARKET FEEDING

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.498
THROUGH INTO LOWER INCOME CO

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:55.166
HOLDS.

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:56.300
THE FEMALE LIFE PORTAL FORCED

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.269
PARTICIPATION WENT UP VERY

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:58.869
SHOPPING --

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.871
STICK WITH THE TWENTY FIVE TO

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:01.806
THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD AND ALSO

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.607
FOR LATINO HISPANIC --

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:04.875
GROUPS IN THE LABOR FORCE SO

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:07.778
THAT WAS VERY ENCOURAGING BUT IT

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.280
HAS TO CONTINUE.

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.448
ANOTHER ONE IS PRODUCTIVITY AND

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.348
ANOTHER ONE IS --

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:12.416
DOES THE FED HAVE THE

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.819
FLEXIBILITY --

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.454
TO ALLOW THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.722
TO KEEP GOING AND THAT'S BEEN A

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.290
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT SINCE

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:22.059
DECEMBER WAY FED CHAIRMAN PAL --

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.395
SAID THAT THE FED COULD AFFORD

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:25.429
TO WHITE.

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.465
AND CALIBRATE ECONOMY A LITTLE

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:29.433
LIST MECHANISTICALLY THAN IT HAD

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.701
BEEN FILLING ON WHEN IT STARTED

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.036
TO RAISE INTEREST RATES.

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.270
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE FED

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.306
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN IN THE MID

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.574
NINETEEN NINETIES TO SO THE

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.042
ECONOMY STARTING TO BACK OFF

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:39.910
WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES.

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:42.046
AND THEY BACKED OFF RAISING

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:45.249
RATES IN FACT I CUT RATES IN

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:46.150
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND NINETY

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:46.684
NINETY EIGHT SAID THAT FIT

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:48.119
FLEXIBILITY.

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:52.556
IS ONE REASON THAT PEOPLE WILL

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.225
BECOME THE FOCAL --

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:55.493
ONE OF THE SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:56.227
MENTION --

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:58.529
IN IN BULLET POINT FORM THREE

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.064
FOR THE CHALLENGES WHY ARE THE

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:04.301
MARKETS KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:05.069
EIGHTEEN ONE OF THE REASONS IS

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.771
THAT THE US ECONOMIC EXPANSION

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.272
IS GETTING VERY LONG BY JUNE IT

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.974
WILL BE A RECORD. TEN YEAR

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.342
ECONOMIC EXPANSION.

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:15.179
JAPAN'S IN FACT NOW SEVENTY FIVE

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.547
MONTHS A POST WORLD WAR TWO

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:19.750
RECORD OF AB SEVENTY FIVE MONTHS

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.452
AND SOME OF THE OTHER ECONOMIC

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.553
EXPANSIONS AROUND THE GLOBE

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.822
LOOKING LONG IN THE TOOTH.

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.157
THAT BELIEVE THAT MEANS THAT

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:28.459
THERE START TO BE HEAD WINS

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.361
AGAINST ECONOMIC GROWTH RATHER

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:31.562
THAN TAIL WIND SO.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:32.663
THE MATURITY OF SOME OF THE

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:36.400
ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS IS A PROBLEM.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.535
ANOTHER ONE IS OF THE LABOR

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:38.836
MARKET IS VERY TIGHT AS I

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.704
MENTIONED BEFORE THE NUMBER OF

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.240
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WORK --

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:46.544
IS IS GETTING VERY VERY LOVE SO.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.046
WE NEED TO THINK A AND THEN FED

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.080
CHAIRMAN PAL ALSO MENTION THIS

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.382
IS MORNING WE START WE NEED TO

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.783
START THINKING ABOUT INNOVATIVE

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.052
WAYS. TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.320
LOOKING FOR JOBS WITH THAT'S

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.788
GOING INTO PRISONS WHETHER IT'S

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.490
GOING --

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:00.791
INTO THE OPIOID --

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.626
PROBLEM PARTICULARLY WITH THE

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:05.095
YOUNG MALES WE WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:07.865
POOL OF LABOR THE DRAWER ON YET --

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.900
THE WE HAVE BEEN FEMALES --

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.603
IN IN IN THE LABOR FORCE SAID.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.572
NOW THAT PROBLEM CLEAR ITSELF UP

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.473
A LITTLE BIT IN TWENTY EIGHT TO

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.376
EIGHT BUT THAT COULD JUST BE

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:20.945
TEDIOUS SOCRATIC.

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:22.246
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS TO THE U. S.

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:25.482
ENGAGED IN A TRADE WAR GLOBALLY

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.917
NOT ANY WITH CHINA BUT WITH YOUR

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:29.053
NOW WE SAY THAT WE CAN BE IN

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.354
THAT WINDOW FROM THAT BUT IF YOU

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:32.022
LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC DATA.

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:33.357
TYPICALLY U. S..

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:34.592
THE US ECONOMY IS HIGHLY

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.961
CORRELATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE.

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:39.196
SO I COOL AND WE START TO SLOW

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:42.466
DOWN GLOBAL YEAR OF THE TURNING

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:44.335
AND SALES AS WELL.

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.804
AND THAT'S A BIG THING WITH THE

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:49.406
LOCAL AT THAT THE US INVESTORS

00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:50.774
HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT --

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.743
THIS YEAR.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.411
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT.

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:55.613
EVEN THOUGH DIRECT TRADE IS ONLY

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.014
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.115
ECONOMY.

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:00.517
S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:02.786
45% OF THE STYLES ARE APPROVED

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.889
SO THEY PRODUCING A BROAD INTO

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.423
FOREIGN MARKETS SO.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.292
THAT THEY START TO SEE A TRADE

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.493
WAR -- THEY

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.365
THEY THE CORPORATE SECOND FLOOR --

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.933
CHINA SLOWDOWN IS ANOTHER BIG

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.500
ISSUE AND AND THE YOU KNOW

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:19.136
CALIFORNIA HAS A PARTICULARLY

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.070
WHEN WE CATCH WITH CHINA.

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:20.871
CHINA'S ECONOMY HAS ACTUALLY

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.306
SLOWED DOWN THE EFFICIENT NUMBER

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:24.775
SAY SIX AND SIX AND CHANGE.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.811
SOME OF THE MORE AGGREGATED

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.280
PARTIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS SAYING

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:33.417
CHINA'S ANY GROWING 32425% --

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.686
CHINA HAS PLENTY OF LEVELS IN

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.187
WHICH TO TRY AND IMPROVE ITS

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:37.988
FARMING.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.523
THE SOMETHING CALLED IMPOSSIBLE

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.158
TRINITY WHICH SAYS THAT CHINA

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.993
CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.962
AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:45.362
THEIR STARTING --

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:48.599
TO BOTTOM OUT THE IS THAT --

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.567
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE.

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:53.737
TO IN TIME TO PREVENT A BIGGER

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.606
SLOWDOWN IN CHINA'S ECONOMY.

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:56.874
THE U. S. FEDERAL DEBT

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.643
TRAJECTORIES BIG ISSUE --

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.412
YOU EXTEND HIS BRIAN --

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:03.747
SHOCKLEY SAN USUAL FOR THIS

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:04.815
STAGE OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE WILL

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:05.783
BE -- FOR

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:08.452
THE US TO BE RUNNING SUCH.

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.387
A LARGE LEVEL OF ANNUAL DEBT.

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:11.021
AND ON MARCH ONE WE HAVE TO

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.157
WORRY ABOUT THE EXTENSION OF THE

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:16.093
DEBT CEILING WHICH IS BEING

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.661
SYSTEM FOR AWHILE.

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.430
AND IN FIVE FINALLY --

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:20.097
ONE MORE I WILL MENTION IS THAT

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:21.565
CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:22.433
SINCE.

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:23.000
TWO THOUSAND NINE HAVE BEEN

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:23.834
ADDING LIQUIDITY TO THE GLOBAL

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.235
SYSTEM THROUGH.

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.271
BUYING PHONES ESSENTIALLY AND

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.505
THAT GETS INTO BANK RESERVES SO

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:30.507
IF HE PROVES YOU BELIEVE BANKS

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.909
TO LEND Là IT ENDS UP IN HOUSE

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:32.343
PRICES.

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:34.979
IT ENDS UP IN STOCK AND BOND

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.013
PRICES.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.181
RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.248
THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS

00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:39.516
STOPPED DOING QUANTITATIVE

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.018
EASING THE FED IS ACTUALLY

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:41.752
REVERSING ITS QUANTITATIVE

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:41.986
EASING.

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:42.686
SO THERE'S A BIG LIQUIDITY

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:43.620
IMPACT ON THE WORLD.

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:46.523
WHICH SAY THE GROWTH WILL NOT

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:49.626
NECESSARILY GOING TO GET --

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.762
A GOOD OUTCOMES --

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:52.963
FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THAT

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.466
LEADS INTO CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:57.668
CORPORATE BEHAVIOR IF FINANCIAL

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:58.702
MARKETS ON STRONG.

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.838
SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY --

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:02.439
YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS A

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.307
GOOD YEAR --

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.342
FOR THE U. S. ECONOMY --

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.311
BUT FINANCIAL MARKETS AND AND IN

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:09.380
GENERAL WHEN YOU WE LOOK FOR WE

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.081
START TO SEE SOME MORE PROBLEMS.

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:12.583
BASED ON THINGS LIKE MATURITY OF

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:13.917
THE CYCLE --

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:16.387
FEDERAL DEBT --

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:17.788
AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE CAUSING

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.857
PROBLEMS --

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:21.492
AGAIN MY MESSAGE WOULD PROBABLY

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:22.826
BE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:23.927
TWENTIES MORE CHALLENGING

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.529
ENVIRONMENT THE WILL BE SO --

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:28.599
UP UNTIL NOW IN THE LAST COUPLE

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:29.099
OF YEARS OF THE ECONOMIC

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:32.770
EXPANSION.

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.138
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.472
QUESTIONS --

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.974
IF MISTER ROTH OF THE THOUGHT IS

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.008
OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF ANY

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:39.610
COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS MOMENT

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:42.212
HAVE ANY YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.114

THANK YOU MISTER I FEEL THAT

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:45.582
WITH WHAT INFORMATION TO FIT IN

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:46.583
IN THE TIME THAT YOU YOU

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.218
MEASURED IT BUT THANK YOU I'M IF

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:49.353
I WAS WONDER IF YOU COULD PLEASE

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.188
SPEAK TO SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA'S

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.556
HISTORY SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:53.724
IMPACTED BY THE GOAL GLOBAL

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:57.361
TRADE WAR --

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:58.662
WE AT AGE IT THAT MIGHT BE

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:00.097
SOMETHING THAT YOU --

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:02.166
CAROLINE MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO

00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:03.801
TALK ABOUT I'D I I WORK IN THE

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.202
AREA OF THE CALPERS WHICH LOOKS

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.603
AT THE BIG MORE MACRO

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.672
ENVIRONMENT SO --

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.007
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A FEEL FOR

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:11.108
WHICH INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MORE

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:13.077
AFFECTED OBVIOUSLY THE TRADING

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.344
GAUGE WENT HAS BEEN.

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.880
MORE ONEROUS FOR THINGS LIKE

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:19.950
TECH.

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:21.952
AS OPPOSED TO THE FOLKS WHO MAKE

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:22.820
SERVICE SECTOR GOODS --

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.721
SO -- IN

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.724
THIS LATEST ROUND OF REPORTING

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.059
BY THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.127
COMPANIES WE ACTUALLY PEOPLE IN

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.396
HEALTHCARE AND LUXURY GOODS

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.531
SILES WAITRESSES ENGAGEMENT WITH

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:35.332
CHINA IS ACTUALLY GOING REALLY

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.133
WELL.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.135
SUCH A REAL BIFURCATION I THINK

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.636
BETWEEN TAKEN INDUSTRY

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.839
MANUFACTURING VERSES SERVICE

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:45.375
SECTOR WHICH OF CHINA'S TRY TO

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:48.245
RE BALANCE OUR ECONOMY MORE --

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.180
MORTARBOARD SCHOOL WOULD --

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.515
SERVICE SECTOR PURCHASES --

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:53.851
THAT ENGAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:57.354
FAIRLY POSITIVE IN.

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:57.921
TWENTY EIGHTEEN EARLIER YOU

00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:58.956
MENTION ABOUT THE SLOWING

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.324
HOUSING MARKET --

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.792
YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.227
SEVERAL FACTORS THAT SO

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.828
BASICALLY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.396
THE TO THAT SITUATION.

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:09.700
DIMENSION RENT CONTROL AND THE

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:10.501
YOU KNOW.

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:10.901
UP -- I

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:12.636
NOTED THERE WAS SOME CONCERTED

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.972
EFFORT AT ALL WORKING ON THE

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:17.708
RENT CONTROL WHAT KIND OF ROLE

00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:19.643
WITH THAT PLAY INTO THE

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.347
OVERRIDING QUESTION IF ANY --

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.716
WELL I I MEAN WE THE WAY WE LOOK

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:27.651
AT IT IS WE ARE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:30.287
WE WE BASICALLY TAKE THE THE

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:31.622
LANDSCAPE THE WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.023
IF YOU HAD --

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.525
SOME KIND OF DILUTION OF RENT

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:35.826
CONTROL --

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.461
THAT COULD SEND OUT MORE OF A

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:40.130
SIGNAL FLOW WARD TO WARD MORE

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.465
BUILDING AT CENTER.

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:42.633
BUT IT IT DOES SEEM TO BE A

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:43.867
NATIONAL PROBLEM THE THE

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.636
BUILDING PROBLEM THE SHORTAGE OF

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:48.305
WORKERS THE THE HIGH COST OF

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.007
BUILDING A HOME THAT'S RIGHT

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.275
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.309
ANY OTHER PROBLEM QUITE FRANKLY

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:53.076
IS THAT --

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:55.345
IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.313
A HOUSING OPPORTUNITY INDEX

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.549
WHICH TAKES A HUNDRED CITIES

00:46:58.615 --> 00:46:59.216
HUNDRED TWENTY CITIES AROUND THE

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:00.217
U. S..

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:00.784
LOOKS AT WHETHER THE MEDIAN

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:03.353
FAMILY CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.055
IN A JURISDICTION WHAT

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:08.926
PERCENTAGE OF MEDIAN FAMILIES --

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:09.560
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF HOUSE OF SOUL

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:12.462
CAN BE FOR AREA AND SOUTHERN

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:14.097
CALIFORNIA LIKE LOS ANGELES AND

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.098
SAN DIEGO THOSE NUMBERS ARE

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.067
INCREDIBLY LOW --

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.769
SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE EXTREMELY

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.270
HIGH PRICES IN THOSE

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:21.738
JURISDICTIONS.

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:22.839
SO -- I'D

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.341
HAVE TO THINK MORE THROUGH THE

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.810
IMPACT OF SOME KIND OF DILUTION

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:29.146
OF RENT CONTROL WHAT IMPACT THAT

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:29.780
MIGHT HAVE ON THE SUPPLY PASSES

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:32.516
BUT AS I SAID --

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.852
CALIFORNIA HOUSE PRICES IT IS --

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:38.222
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WITH

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.656
ALMOST OF THE HISTORICAL.

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.858
NORM AFFORDABILITY --

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:44.828
RIGHT NOW.

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:45.262
THANK YOU.

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.330
MR ROSS GOT A QUICK QUESTION

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:48.432
WHERE ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.467
CALIFORNIA TO ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:54.404
COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVENESS.

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:56.707
WELL I WOULD SAY --

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.709
I'D I'D SAY THAT --

00:47:58.775 --> 00:47:59.643
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE AREAS OF

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:04.248
GROWTH WILL INCLUDE --

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.849
SAID THE THE STATE DEVELOPING

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.918
SERVICE CHECK AROUND THE WORLD

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.386
SO MEXICO TRYING OR ITS ADDRESS.

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.587
THE EMERGING MIDDLE CLASS IN

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:13.223
THOSE COUNTRIES --

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.925
THE SIGNIFICANT áP APPETITE WE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.627
GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPOSED TOWARD

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.729
BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.530
COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:21.999
AND OTHER SERVICES.

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.433
AND SO -- I

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.068
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE AREA

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:27.571
THAT WE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE --

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.905
TO TO ENGAGE BETTER AND THEN OF

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:32.142
COURSE IN THE IT WORLD --

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:34.278
IT REALLY WE REALLY COLLATERAL

00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:37.014
DAMAGE OR WHATEVER OF WATER

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.016
COMES OUT OF THE THE ENGAGEMENT

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.917
BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND THE THE

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.120
CHINESE GOVERNMENT [inaudible]

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:46.223
THANK YOU.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:47.924
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.860
JUST A FEW MADAM CHAIR JUST ON

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:52.329
THE THE 45% --

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.164
INVESTMENT ABROAD THAT THE S.

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.165
AND P. IS DOING.

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.199
AND THAT --

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.434
STARTS TO LOOK AT THE

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.236
PROJECTIONS AS FAR AS THE

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:00.637
DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS THAT WE

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:02.072
SEE.

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.908
HOW -- HOW

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.343
VISUAL IT SHOULD WE BE OF

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.811
KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT IT IS THAT

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:08.178
THE --

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:09.846
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING AS

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:12.182
IS DISCUSSING WORLDWIDE --

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:13.550
DISCUSSIONS WITH DIFFERENT

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.653
NATIONS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS US.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.622
I THINK THERE I THINK IN GENERAL

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:21.091
THERE WAS SOME ISSUES --

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:23.994
THE CHALLENGING ISSUES CHINA --

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:26.029
BUT I THINK WE DON'T WE DON'T

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:28.598
WANT TWO CHASE A STRAW MAN AS

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.701
FAR AS THAT GOES BECAUSE THE

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:32.869
ARRANGEMENT WE HAD WITH CHINA

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:33.470
GOING ON SINCE THEIR ACCESSION

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:38.809
TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:39.443
TWO THOUSAND THREE HAD A LOT OF

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:42.212
MUTUALLY.

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.246
SO -- IF YOU

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:46.883
KNOW THE US SUPPLYING --

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:47.784
AS CHINA SUPPLYING.

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:51.655
CONSUMPTION --

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.690
FOR IMPACTING CORPORATE PROFITS

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:55.692
AND AND THEN ALLOWING --

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:57.227
YOU KNOW THE THE THE BETTER

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.662
PERFORMANCE OF US CORPORATE

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.896
SECTOR.

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.098
BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME DOWN

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.265
SIDES OF THAT YOU KNOW WHICH OR

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.834
HOLLOWING OUT OF MANUFACTURING

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.001
SECTOR IN THE U. S. AND SOME OF

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.636
THE SIX IS THE US BUT THAT'S

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:07.571
REALLY BEEN HAPPENING GLOBALLY

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.906
SO -- THE I

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:12.209
THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS TO GET

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:15.178
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.813
OF THE ENGAGEMENT --

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.150
IF IF US CORPORATIONS ARE --

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.318
GOING TO BE HURT BY.

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:23.453
THIS AND WE AREN'T GOING TO GET

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.621
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.823
COMPANIES COMING BACK ON SHORE

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.625
ESSENTIALLY TAX CUTS ARE BEING

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:32.496
USED. FOR BUY BACKS AND DIVIDEND

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:33.430
NINE SECOND BEING USED TO

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.132
INCREASE NECESSARILY HIRING --

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.401
CAP EX --

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:38.969
THAT'S THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.737
SO IS THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.439
SURE THAT THE OUTCOME BUT WE GET

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:45.475
IS BENEFICIAL I THINK TO THE TWO

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.277
THE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY PUBLIC

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.178
FOR THE CORPORATE SECTOR BUT

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:49.980
ALSO WE WANT TO SEE.

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.982
A GREAT A HIRING AS WELL AS A

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.617
PROBLEM IN THE US ECONOMY IS WE

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.419
WERE VERY TIGHT ON HIRING ANYWAY.

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.120
WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT SUPPLY OF

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.922
LABOR RIGHT NOW SO.

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:00.390
I WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.326
MORE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE OLD.

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.195
IN WOOD MIGRATION --

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.797
PROGRAMS TO BETTER EDUCATE

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.732
AMERICANS --

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.000
IN ORDER THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.168
GET A SHIFTING OF SOME

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.336
PRODUCTION BACK ON SHORE AND

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.671
THAT THAT IS DONE --

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.807
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT --

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.575
WE HAVE SKILLED WORKERS. TO BE

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:19.976
ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:21.912
SO BETTER FOCUS I THINK OF THE

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:24.014
POLICIES WOULD TO IMPROVE.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.416
THE OUTCOMES OF THE ENGAGEMENT

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:27.684
WE DOING CHINA.

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.252
THANK YOU AND RESTORE FINAL

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:30.687
QUESTION MADAM CHAIR --

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.155
THE HOUSING DO YOU THINK THAT

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.857
THERE'S A THE IMPACT AS FAR AS

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.959
THE THE MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNTS

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:36.860
THAT ARE BEING OFFERED THROUGH

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.628
FHA LOAN SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:39.129
THINGS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.063
GOVERNMENT.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.632
ARE IMPACTING THE THE OWNERSHIP

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.334
OF OWNS AND SOME OF THE BUILDING

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.535
OF THOSE PHONES BECAUSE IT'S OUT

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:48.505
PACING SOME TO QUALIFY. FOR THE

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:51.942
AMOUNT OF THOSE HOMES ARE.

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.076
I I I THINK THAT AFTER THE

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:55.212
FINANCIAL CRISIS IN IN --

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:57.280
IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ITEMS ARE

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.182
JUSTIFIABLE --

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.618
CAN'T A REACTION WHICH IS THAT --

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.453
WE GOT INTO A CRAZY LEVERAGE

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.588
CYCLE WHERE --

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:06.890
THEY WERE THE THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.025
LENDING GOING ON NOW --

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:10.594
I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.628
FACTORS WHY HOUSING IS BUDGET

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.396
BEING A MUCH SLOWER.

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.899
AND THEREFORE MORE COMFORTING --

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.435
GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCKS.

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:19.936
IN THE CRAZY SOCCER WILL BE

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:21.805
HEADING IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS.

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:24.040
ONE OF IT IS ACCESSTO LOANS I

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:24.875
THINK --

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.643
KIND OF TALK TO STAND ITS OWN

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.277
WHEN.

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.578
THERE'S ALSO NUMBER A NUMBER OF

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:31.982
OTHER FACTORS AS WELL --

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:33.483
INCLUDING.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.919
THE FACT THAT WE ARE CHANGING AT

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.189
TASTE AWARD MULTI UNIT.

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:39.756
LIVING AS OPPOSED TO SINGLE

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.224
FAMILY --

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.593
THAT THAT KIND OF CHANGE THIS IS

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.429
GOING ON NINE AND ALSO --

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.865
YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMING OUT OF

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.567
THE SUB PRIME PRIME.

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:51.368
BANKRUPTCIES AND THINGS LIKE

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.502
THAT BASICALLY GOING BACK INTO

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.770
RENTAL SPACE.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:54.604
SO I THINK THIS A NUMBER OF

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.805
THINGS ONE OF IT IS PROBABLY

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.641
IMPEDIMENTS TO LANDING --

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.910
BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO AVOID

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:00.944
GOING BACK TO THE KIND OF CYCLE

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.346
WE HAD BACK IN --

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:04.281
I CAN THE ONLY TWO THOUSAND AND

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.883
AND QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW WE

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.319
THE CONSUMER SIDE IS IN MUCH

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:10.720
BETTER SHAPE THAN WAS IN THE TWO

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:11.688
THOUSANDS.

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:13.423
THERE ARE POCKETS OF CONCERN

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.125
LIKE THE OUTSTANDING LEVEL OF

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.626
STUDENT LOANS WHICH I THINK IS

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.427
ABOUT ONE FOUR POINT FIVE

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.128
TRILLION.

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:20.330
SO MAYBE SOME POLICY CHANGES AND

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.231
THEY DID THEIR OF SOME POLICY

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.033
PRESCRIPTIONS --

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.501
WHAT WE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.603
SEE IS --

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.205
HOUSING HAVING A BIT OF OUR IN

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.107
THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.075
WE ARE STARTING TO GET HIGH

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:33.510
HOUSEHOLD FORMATION.

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.312
WE ARE STARTING TO GET LOWER

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.680
INCOME GROUPS BY --

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.415
OWNING HOUSES AS OPPOSED TO

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.749
RENTING SO SOME OF THOSE THINGS

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:40.317
ARE QUIETLY GOING ON IN THE

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.284
BACKGROUND.

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:42.385
THAT I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:43.620
SEE THE ECONOMIC CYCLE GOING A

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:46.590

OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.647
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AN

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.948
ECONOMY THAT IS --

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.984
FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR TYPE

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.453
OF I'LL PUT LIKE AGRICULTURE OR

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.388
OR I. T. WE WE HAVE AN A NUMBER

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:26.856
OF DIFFERENT --

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:29.225
STRINGS.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.727
THIS CHURCH SHOWS YOU THE

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:33.396
PROPORTION OF JOBS IN PARTICULAR

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:35.131
SECTORS THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.067
AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:39.436
COUNTRY SO.

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:40.603
LOOKING AT THIS.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.771
AND SEE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.707
HIGH PROPORTION OF CERTAIN

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.942
SECTOR JOBS SO I'M SURPRISINGLY

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:48.144
CALIFORNIA HAS OVER 50%.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.879
OF THE NATION'S JOBS IN MOTION

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.314
PICTURES SO THAT'S DOWN IN LA

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.283
AND HOLLYWOOD OF A HIGH

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:54.517
PROPORTION OF THE COUNTRY'S

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.886
AGRICULTURAL JOBS IN THE CENTRAL

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.254
VALLEY PREDOMINANTLY --

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.823
AND ALSO A HIGH PROPORTION OF

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.091
THE COUNTRY'S --

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:04.260
ATTACKER I. T. JOBS IN WEB

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.062
SEARCH AND INTERNET PUBLISHING.

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.230
OVERALL THOUGH THE STATE ONLY

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:13.069
HAS ABOUT 11% OF OF JOBS NATION.

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:14.537
SO THIS NEXT CHART --

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.106
SHOWS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.408
FIRST SHOWS THE PROPORTION OF

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.542
JOBS -- BY

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.244
AREA IN THE STATES SO AS YOU CAN

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:23.780
SEE ALMOST HALF THE STATE'S JOBS

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:25.315
ARE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:26.349
REGION.

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:28.718
AND THEN ABOUT A QUARTER OF JOBS

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.720
ARE IN THE BAY AREA.

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:31.788
IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE NEXT

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:33.256
CHART HERE IT SHOWS YOU THE

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:35.225
CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULAR

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.761
SECTORS IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.262
THE STATE SO THIS REALLY BREAKS

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:39.696
OUT.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.397
ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH CERTAIN

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:43.166
REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA REALLY

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:45.001
HAVE KIND OF A REGIONAL SPECIFIC

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.436
ECONOMY THAT HAS A PARTICULAR

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:47.971
FOCUS.

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.405
SO IN THE BAY AREA AND THERE IS

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:52.876
A HIGHER I. T. AND AND

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:54.511
PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL JOBS --

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:55.612
AND THEN IN THE GREATER LOS

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:57.547
ANGELES REGION WHICH IS REALLY A

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.149
GOODS HUB FOR THE STATE THERE'S

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:00.750
A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:01.684
STATE'S TRANSPORTATION

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.386
WAREHOUSING JOBS.

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:05.755
UNSURPRISINGLY SACRAMENTO --

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.557
HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF STATE

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.826
GOVERNMENT JOBS AT ALMOST 25%

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:10.593
AND THEN --

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.061
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS OVER

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:14.097
HALF THE STATE'S AGRICULTURE

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:16.966
JOBS.

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:19.169
SO WITH INCOMES IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.904
OVERALL CALIFORNIA INCOMES ARE

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.338
HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:23.473
UNITED STATES.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.141
THE MEDIAN INCOMES IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.743
IS ABOUT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.078
DOLLARS AT LEAST OF TWO THOUSAND

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:29.679
SIXTEEN PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:30.747
HIGHER NOW.

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.549
I'M IN CALIFORNIA'S --

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:33.650
HIGH INCOME EARNERS ALSO EARN

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:36.419
HIGHER THAN THEIR PEERS ACROSS

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.355
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:40.590
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.358
FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIATION ACROSS

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:43.726
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF INCOME

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.094
THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THE

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:46.996
VARIATION IN INCOME BY REGION

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:49.833
AND THEN ALSO BY INCOME GROUP --

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:51.501
SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE BAY AREA

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.670
HAS THE HIGHEST INCOMES OVERALL

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.772
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS --

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.440
THE LOWEST INCOMES OF THE

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.609
REGIONS LISTED HERE YOU CAN ALSO

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:02.478
SEE THE SORT OF THE SPREAD OUT

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.547
MISS. FOR HALF OF A BETTER TERM

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:09.552
OF INCOMES THE CHURCHES YOU THE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:12.121
GEN AND THE TOP. 10% OF

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:13.790
HOUSEHOLDS SO YOU CAN SEE THE

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.425
VARIATION BETWEEN THE MEDIAN --

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:17.594
AND THE TOP 10% OF HOUSEHOLDS BY

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.297
REGION HERE.

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:22.799
SO MOVING INTO INCOME AND THEN

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.367
HOW IT PLAYS INTO THE STATE'S

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.568
REVENUE IS.

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.936
THE LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME IN

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:28.304
CALIFORNIA ARE WAGES AND

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:29.973
SALARIES ALMOST A TRILLION

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.342
DOLLARS ON THAT'S FOLLOWED BY

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.911
CAPITAL GAINS OUT OF A HUNDRED

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:35.478
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:36.112
THEN --

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:37.981
PENSIONS ANNUITIES AND IRA

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:40.383
DISTRIBUTIONS AND A HUNDRED AND

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.919
TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.454
NOW I'M LOOKING AT HOW THESE

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.723
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INCOME PLAY

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.992
IN NEW ON PEOPLE'S EARNINGS THIS

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:51.527
CHART MIRRORS THE LAST ONE SO

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.962
THE BLUE SHE ANSWERED OUR

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.330
FRIENDLY WAGES AND SALARY AND

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.164
RETIREMENT.

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.666
INCOME AND THEN THE ORANGE

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.534
SHADES ARE CAPITAL GAINS

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.169
PARTNERSHIP INCOME DIVIDENDS

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:01.738
INTEREST AND RENTS WERE YOU CAN

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:02.672
SEE FROM THIS CHART IS THAT YOU

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.474
MOVE AS YOU MOVE UP THE INCOME

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.410
DISTRIBUTION WE STARTED

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.745
004-400-1000 DOLLARS AND THEN

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:09.846
THE LAST HOME IS --

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.447
OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOU

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:12.749
CAN SEE THAT THE PROPORTION OF

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:15.852
INCOME FROM WAGES TO CLIENTS AS

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.253
PEOPLE'S INCOMES INCREASES IN

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.955
THE PROPORTION OF INCOME FROM

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.023
CAPITAL GAINS.

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:23.793
PARTNERSHIP INCOME IN OTHERS

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.297
REALLY STARTS TO INCREASE.

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.097
THEN THIS NEXT CHART SHOWS YOU

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:29.699
THE VARIATION OR THIS SORT OF

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.201
VOLATILITY OF INCOME BY INCOME

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.803
TYPE AND AND WE'LL TALK NEXT

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.971
ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYS INTO

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:36.973
REVENUES --

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.175
IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES BUT WHAT

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.143
YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT WE JUST

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:41.210
AND SALARIES WHICH IS THE

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.379
LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME OVERALL

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:44.981
IS RELATIVELY STABLE AND IT'S

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:46.215
YOUR TO YOUR GROW THIS CHART

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.417
SHOWS YOU THE PERCENT CHANGE

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.018
YEAR OVER YEAR.

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.386
IN CONTRAST CAPITAL GAINS

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.754
PARTNERSHIP INCOME THESE ARE

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.923
VERY VOLATILE AND ANY CHANGE

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.591
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YOUR YOUR

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:59.095
AGAIN LOOKING AT THE TOTAL

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.397
PERCENT CHANGE.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.299
SINCE THE NINETIES --

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.602
THE LARGER SHARE OF INCOME TIME

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.137
TO THE THAT TO HIGH INCOME

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:12.041
EARNERS THOSE IN AND EIGHTY IF.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.643
THOSE EARNING EIGHTY IN THE

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.111
EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE ON ABOVE.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.446
AND AND YOU CAN SEE HERE AGAIN

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:17.113
THE PERCENT CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.448
YOU CAN SEE THE GROWTH

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.316
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE END OF THE

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.417
GREAT RECESSION --

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:24.921
IN THE HIGHEST IN THE HIGHEST

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:27.223
INCOME EARNERS.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.524
SO MOVING TO REVENUES AND WE'LL

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.827
GET INTO HOW ON THE GROWTH IN

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.862
THE HAITIAN EARNERS PLAYS INTO

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:33.997
THE STATE'S OVERALL REVENUE

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.999
SYSTEM IN JUST A SECOND --

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.400
THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THE

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.102
DISTRIBUTION OF THAT

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.137
CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM SO THERE

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.638
ARE THREE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.507
HERE THE FOR THE INNERMOST

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.376
CIRCLE SHOWS YOU THE SPLIT --

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:48.578
IN TOTAL TAX REVENUE BETWEEN THE

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:50.279
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.948
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF STATE.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.816
OF TAX REVENUE GOES THE STATE

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.184
AND ABOUT ONE THIRD GOES TO

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.586
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR THE

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.121
STATE'S REVENUE THE LARGEST

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.188
SOURCE OF REVENUE IS THE

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:00.556
PERSONAL INCOME TAX WHICH YOU

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.592
SEE IN IN THE SECOND CONCENTRIC

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.726
CIRCLE.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.763
AND THEN ON IN THE OUTERMOST

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.698
CIRCLE THOSE --

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:09.832
HI SLICES SHOW YOU THE SOURCES

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.300
OF THOSE --

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.568
OF THOSE REVENUES SO AGAIN

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:14.203
PERSONAL INCOME TAXES YOU CAN

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.839
SEE THE LARGEST OUT ON PORTION

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:17.840
OF THAT HIGH IS WAGES AND

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:18.975
SALARIES --

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:19.909
AND THEN THEY'RE ALL THE OTHER

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.511
COMPONENTS OF INCOMES INCOME AND

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.713
THEN SIMILARLY ON THE

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.281
CORPORATION TAX AND THE SALES

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.050
AND USE TAX YOU CAN SEE HOW.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:28.584
THE SOURCES OF THOSE TAX BREAK

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:31.554
OUT ACROSS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT --

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:35.158
TYPES OF OF SALES OF GOD.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.959
SO SINCE THE NINETIES THE

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.961
PERSONAL INCOME TAX HAS GROWN

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.463
MUCH FASTER --

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.765
THEN THE SALES AND USE TAX AS

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.468
WELL AS THE CORPORATION TAX AND

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.103
IN LARGE PART THIS IS --

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.971
INCOME GROWTH AT THE HIGH INCOME

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.106
AT THE HIGH END OF THE INCOME

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:52.208
DISTRIBUTION IN COMBINATION WITH

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.376
THE STATE'S PROGRESSIVE RATE

THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:37.520
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.589
DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME?

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.357
WHICH IS THE CENTER --

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.525
LATER ORANGE COLUMN THAT FALLS

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.559
MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:45.995
DISTRIBUTION IN THE FIFTY TO TWO

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:47.063

ANTS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.094
SUSTAINABILITY WE'VE GOT A LONG

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.730
WAY TO GO BUT THAT PROGRESS IS

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.131
AN INDICATOR OF WHAT WE CAN DO.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.033
AND WE IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF US

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.134
INVOLVED IN THE SUMMIT BELIEVE

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.136
THE TWENTY NINETEEN IS A VERY

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.037
IMPORTANT YEAR VERY IN.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.473
CORN OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.375
TO INCREASE THE SCALE IN THE

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:06.942
SPEED AT WHICH WERE MAKING

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:07.843
PROGRESS.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.845
NOT JUST AGAINST THE NUMBERS

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.547
WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH NOW IN

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.082
TERMS OF INCOME INEQUALITY AN

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.383
OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.584
BUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE KNOW

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.686
WE FACE IN THE FUTURE AS WHETHER

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.922
IT'S A AYE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:21.423
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.425
ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.427
POLICY THAT THE MENTIONED AND SO

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:26.428
WE WERE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.763
SETTING UP TO SOLVE TODAY'S

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.565
PROBLEMS AND SETTING IT UP SO

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.900
THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.668
FASTER BETTER AND CHEAPER GOING

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:33.502
FORWARD.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.670
I WANNA MAKE THREE MAIN POINTS

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:37.806
FROM GATED SUBJECT THAT WHAT

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:39.308
YOU'RE TAKING ON TODAY THE FIRST

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.276
IS THAT.

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.577
EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.579
PROSPERITY REQUIRES A

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:46.181
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION.

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.583
THAT'S THE SYSTEM SCALE.

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:48.951
LEVEL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.219
SOLVE THIS WITH A PROGRAM WE'RE

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.453
NOT GONNA SOLVE IT WITH A

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.621
FUNDING SHIFT.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.924
IT REALLY TAKES ALL OF THE

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.091
PIECES COMING TOGETHER.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.928
CHANGING FUNDAMENTALLY HOW THESE

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.496
PROGRAMS AND HOW THESE POLICIES

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.097
AND HOW THEY STRATEGIES WORK.

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:03.899
AND THAT MAY SOUND DON TEAM BUT

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.100
AGAIN WE'VE BEEN MAKING US HERE

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:07.803
THAT SHOWS US WE CAN DO THIS.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.505
THE SECOND IS THAT IF WE WANNA

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.340
TAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO SPEED

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.708
AND SCALE.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.943
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORMALIZE

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.077
OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.812
PARTICULARLY HOW IS IT WE MAKE

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.881
THESE DECISIONS NOT JUST HERE IN

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:19.949
THE CAPITAL AND AT THE STATE

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:22.518
LEVEL BUT IN COORDINATION WITH

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:23.819
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RETURN.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.054
THAT'S THE KEY GOVERNANCE

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.488
CHALLENGE WE'VE GOT.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:27.556
AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT IF WE

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:28.691
WANT TO MOVE PAST MARGINAL

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:31.126
CHANGES INCREMENTAL CHANGES.

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.596
AND THIRD TO THE PRECISE FOCUS

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.164
OF THIS CONVERSATION THERE IS AN

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:38.067
URGENCY TO INNOVATE AND TO

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.468
EMIGRATE AND TO ACCELERATE.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:40.836
ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.438
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.739
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:44.640
SOMEONE SPEND JUST A FEW MINUTES

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:47.176
ON EACH OF THOSE.

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.377
THREE FIRST BY WAY BACKGROUND

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:49.144
FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:50.846
CALIFORNIA FORWARD MANAGES BUT

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.214
WE'RE JUST THE MANAGER.

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:54.149
OF THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT ON BEHALF

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:55.517
OF WITH.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.920
THE WHOLE SET OF REGIONAL CIVIC

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.154
ORGANIZATIONS --

01:10:59.221 --> 01:10:59.688
UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:02.224
CALIFORNIA STORES AND YOU'RE

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.659
GONNA HEAR IN A FEW MINUTES FROM

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:04.960
PAGANI OF THE CEO OF THE INLAND

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:05.628
EMPIRE.

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.529
ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ONE OF

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.131
THOSE REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:10.165
AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.767
REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:12.868
EIGHT YEARS THAT THE SUMMIT HAS

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.837
BEEN WORKING WITH ATTRACTED A

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.138
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.107
ASSOCIATIONS AND LOCAL

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.708
GOVERNMENTS AND LEADERS.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.243
THAT HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.012
THEY WANT TO WORK CROSS SECTOR

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.847
PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:25.981
SAID SIX ACTOR.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:26.949
THEY REALIZE WE HAVE DISTINCT

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.384
REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND THEY WANT

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.852
TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE WHAT IS

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.854
HAPPENING AT THE REGIONAL SCALE

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.655
TO REDUCE.

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:33.689
INEQUALITY AND TO GROW

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.491
PROSPERITY AND JOBS AND

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:36.892
CONNECTEDNESS AND THEN TO

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.794
CONNECT THAT ACROSS THE REGION'S

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.429
AND WITH THE STATE.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:41.664
AND THIRD THEY ARE PASSIONATE

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.232
ABOUT TRYING TO FIND TRIPLE

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:44.566
BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.802
SIMULTANEOUSLY ADVANCING

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.504
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WAYS

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.638
THAT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.507
INEQUALITY AND INCREASE OUR

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.008
SUSTAINABILITY RESILIENCY

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.243
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF WE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.978
DON'T GET THERE BY SACRIFICING

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.880
ONE FOR THE OTHER.

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:58.714
WE'RE NOT GONNA START WITH NOT

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.115
ENOUGH TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.417
IF IT HAD IF IT HAPPENS THAT THE

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.651
CONSEQUENCE.

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.687
OF JOBS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND A

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:06.121
STRUGGLE BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.256
AND THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT THESE

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.657
GROUPS TOGETHER OVER THE LAST

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.558
EIGHT YEARS EVERY YEAR THERE IS

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.193
A SUMMIT LAST YEAR WAS IN SANTA

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.327
ROSA.

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:12.928
THIS NOVEMBER IT WILL BE IN

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.296
FRESNO --

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.798
EVERY YEAR PEOPLE COME TOGETHER

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.199
THEY ACTUALLY WORK THROUGH TWO

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.467
AND A HALF DAYS TO FIGURE OUT

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.868
WHAT IT IS THEY WANT.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.336
TO PRIORITIZE IN THE NEXT YEAR

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.438
AND THEY PRODUCE A DOCUMENT

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.472
CALLED THE ROADMAP TO SHARE

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.040
PROSPERITY WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:26.108
YOUR PACKET.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.910
SO EVERY YEAR THERE IS A OF A

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.445
NEW ROADMAP THAT SAYS HERE'S

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.713
WHAT WE'VE MADE PROGRESS HERE'S

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:31.380
WHAT WE WANT TO WORK IN THE NEXT

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.648
YEAR.

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.083
AND THEN THEY WORK ON IT ALL

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.385
YEAR LONG THIS IS A SO THIS

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.953
WHERE EVERYBODY COMES TOGETHER

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:38.487
FIVE HUNDRED OR SO LEADERS

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.355
ACROSS THE STATE IN ONE PLACE AT

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.323
ONE TIME.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.758
BUT ALL YEAR LONG LITERALLY

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.593
HUNDREDS.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.162
OF ADVOCATES EXPERTS AND OTHERS

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.731
ARE WORKING TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.499
THAT ROADMAP TO SHARE PROSPERITY

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:51.533
IN DEEP PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.203
GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS.

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.804
LOOK AT THAT ROAD MAP IT IS ED

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.806
INCLUDED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.508
FOR COURT CHALLENGES.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.744
AND THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MORE

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.312
MINUTE ONE MILLION MORE.

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.980
MIDDLE INCOME JOBS.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.515
THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MILLION

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.951
MORE AT LEAST SKILLED WORKERS.

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.753
THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MILLION

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.521
MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES AND THE

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:13.789
NEED TO CREATE ONE MORE MILLION

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.591
ACRE FEET OF WATER EACH YEAR FOR

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.059
TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO BRING OUR

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.128
WATER SUPPLY TO BALANCE.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.395
WE KNOW THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.064
GONNA MOVE A LITTLE BIT A COUPLE

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.766
YEARS AGO WE DID SOME ANALYSIS

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.268
WITH MACKENZIE WHO CAME OUT WITH

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.402
NEED ONE MILLION MARK AFFORDABLE

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.104
JOBS WE NEED THREE POINT FIVE

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.506
MILLION MORE AFFORDABLE JOBS.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.007
YOU MAY HAVE MADE HERE THAT FROM

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.175
THE GOVERNOR NOW THAT'S WHERE

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.510
THAT NUMBER CAME FROM FROM THE

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.711
GOVERNOR'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.412
ECONOMIC SUMMIT.

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:38.647
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:39.948
THERE'S BEEN SOME OTHER ELEMENTS

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.316
ADDED TO THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:42.618
WERE TRYING TO FOCUS OUR WORK

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.186
AGAIN THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.354
WE NEW THAT EVEN IF WE COULD

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.922
MEET THE METRIC OF THOSE MILLION

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:47.890
CHALLENGES.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:49.525
WE WORK ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.260
PROBLEM BECAUSE IN FACT THAT

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.896
WORKFORCE PIPELINE IF YOU LIKE

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.397
THAT TERM BEGINS AT BIRTH.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.932
RIGHT WE KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:57.766
THREE YEARS THE ECONOMIC

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.535
POTENTIAL OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.170
LARGELY INFLUENCED SCIENCE WILL

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.237
TELL US THAT WE CAN DO THE

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.305
ECONOMICS.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:04.940
SO OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.475
FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH IN

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.110
CALIFORNIA HAVE BECOME INVOLVED

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.344
IN THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT SO THAT

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:10.712
THEY CAN START TALKING TO THEIR

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.147
BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.382
ABOUT THE END OF PORTENTS NOT

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:14.683
ONLY OF THOSE EARLY LEARNING

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.151
INVESTMENTS IN LONG TERM

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:18.320
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY BUT HOW DO

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:19.588
WE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZE THOSE

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.089
SO THAT WE GET BETTER RETURNS ON

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:22.224
THAT INVESTMENT.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.292
SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MORE

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.560
MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM BUT IT'S A

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.828
MORE ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY IN

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.296
A BETTER SYSTEM THAT GETS US THE

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.797
RESULTS THAT WE NEED.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.332
IF WHAT WE NEED IS IS ALL

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.167
CALIFORNIANS TO BE CAPABLE OF

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:34.603
DOING THEIR BEST IN THE FUTURE.

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:35.270
UP.

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.905
AS AS A AS WAS REFERENCED IN THE

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.140
QUESTION AROUND HOUSING THE COST

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.308
OF SO MUCH MORE POVERTY PROBLEM

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:40.976
IN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:41.910
BY THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.379
CALIFORNIA AND SO WE AFFORDABLE

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.881
HOUSING SPACE WITH ENGAGE A LOT

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.216
OF THOSE LEADERS OVER THE YEARS.

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:48.550
ON HOW IS IT WE CAN BRING TO

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:50.319
INCREASE THE SUPPLY AND REDUCE

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:52.221
THE COSTS OF HOUSING AND I CAN

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.789
WE CAN PROVIDE LOTS OF

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:54.456
INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.524
DONE ON THAT --

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.292
THIS LAST YEAR WE ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:58.627
THAT -- ALL

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.529
OF THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.130
TERMS OF LONG COMMUTES AND

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.899
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PUTTING

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.601
TOGETHER TO MINIMUM WAGE JOBS IN

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.002
ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:08.503
ACTUALLY IMPACTS THE HEALTH AND

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.771
WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS AND

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.173
SO THIS YEAR WE'RE DOING AN

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.375
OVERLAY ON HOW THIS IMPACTS THE

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.977
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH --

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.311
IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT A

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.512
TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE WE WANT A

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:18.447
MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF THE

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:19.748
QUALITY IN THE WELL BEING OF

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.617
CALIFORNIANS.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:22.384
AND FINALLY --

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.119
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE I THINK

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.554
THERE IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:26.655
OPPORTUNITY FOR TRIPLE BOTTOM

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.757
LINE IS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:29.925
WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:31.260
WORLD COMMUNITIES WITH IN

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:33.629
CALIFORNIA. TO IDENTIFYWHAT ARE

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:34.529
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.865
SIMULTANEOUSLY RESPOND TO THE

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:38.667
WHAT GREAT INCREASING WILDFIRE

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:41.169
THREATS. TO REDUCE THOSE HAZARDS

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.704
TO BETTER MANAGE THE FOREST BOTH

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.872
FOR THIS FOR THE SAKE OF A

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.240
WILDFIRE IN FOR THE SAKE OF OUR

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:48.310
OF OF WATER SYSTEMS AND AND AND

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:49.711
AND WATERSHEDS BEING MANAGE

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:50.312
BETTER IN A TIME OF CLIMATE

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.446
CHANGE.

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:55.517
BY IN FACT RECREATING WOULD THE

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.119
SUSTAINABLE AND SUPPORT THAT --

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.553
THERE'S A LOTS OF INTEREST

01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.755
INTEREST IN THAT THERE'S LOTS OF

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.123
ACTIVITY CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.758
THE SUMMIT IS INVOLVED IN THAT --

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.393
BUT THAT'S THE THROUGH PUT --

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.395
THAT REALLY COULD BE A REALLY

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:06.929
GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.196
TRYING TO TALK ABOUT.

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.865
SO MY SECOND POINT THAT IF IF WE

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:11.833
WANT TO ACCELERATE THE PROGRESS

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.102
THAT WE'RE MAKING WE NEED.

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:14.670
TO FORMALIZE OUR GOVERNANCE

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.238
STRUCTURE --

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:18.573
IN AND THIS CAN THIS IS A LONGER

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.741
CONVERSATION AND IS THE SUBJECT

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:20.876
OF SOME THE LEGISLATION THAT

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.277
YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED YOU WANT

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.712
TO TAKE ON AND SO --

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:24.880
THE SUMMIT IS --

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.648
HAPPY TO OFFER OURSELVES AS A

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:27.582
RESOURCE AND A PARTNER IN

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:31.253
FIGURING THESE THINGS OUT SO AB --

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:31.853
NINE OH SIX BY THE CHAIR WOMAN

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.690
AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS OUTLINES --

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.258
A PROPOSAL AND PUT PUT FORTH

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.026
PROPOSAL FOR HOW THE STATE COULD

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.329
GO ABOUT INTEGRATING WHAT WE ARE

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:41.563
ALREADY DOING.

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.098
DOING THE EVALUATION OF WHAT

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.233
ELSE WE NEED TO DO AND THEN

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.902
COMING UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.437
PLAN THAT WE CAN PURSUE AN

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:49.705
EMPLOYMENT --

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:50.806
AND IT'S A VERY GOOD STARTING

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.074
POINT IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.508
SUMMIT HAS SUPPORTED PREVIOUS

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.010
VERSIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.645
WERE EAGER TO ENGAGE.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.313
IN THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.414
I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE SUMMIT ON

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.249
ITS OWN HAS INITIATED THIS YEAR

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:03.151
WORK ACROSS ITS REGION'S TO PUT

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.087
TOGETHER --

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:08.256
A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL OF EXISTING

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.524
PLANNING EFFORTS GOOD AGGREGATED

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.792
AND BUILT UP SO THAT WHATEVER

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.728
THE STATE DOES IT'S TRULY IN

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.596
RESPONSE TO REGIONAL NEEDS --

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:15.731
WE'VE ALSO GOT ANOTHER WORK

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:18.100
GROUP THAT SAYS IF IF THIS SOME

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.468
KIND OF STRUCTURE WHERE THE

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:20.936
STATE IS CONSULTING WITH THE

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:22.004
REGION'S THE STATUS AND

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.372
DEVELOPING A PLAN THIS IS ABOUT

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:24.973
COMING UP WITH A PLAN THIS IS

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.475
ABOUT COMING UP WITH ON GOING.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.710
PROCESS PLANTS AND PARTNERSHIPS

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.879
TO BE MOVING THIS FORWARD ON AT

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:31.613
THREE SIXTY FIVE DAY BASIS HOW

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.681
DO YOU ACTUALLY ORGANIZING

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:33.982
STRUCTURE THAT SO.

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.484
WE'RE DOING OUR HOMEWORK ON HOW

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.551
YOU COULD ACTUALLY ORGANIZING

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.320
STRUCTURE THAT ONLY TO OFFER

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.122
THAT IS A RESOURCE FOR YOU AS

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.090
YOU CONSIDER YOUR LEGISLATION --

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.459
WE ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR --

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.460
WHEN WE WHEN WE GET DONE WITH

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:46.094
THE SUMMIT THAT COOK FORMER

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.396
CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:48.563
AND CULTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:51.466
ECONOMIC SUMMIT --

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.101
LEMON DON SAID --

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.970
ACCEPTED A REQUEST BY THE

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.605
GOVERNOR TO BECOME HIS LEAD.

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.573
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR AND

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.742
AND MISTER MADONNA HAS AGREED TO

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.110
TAKE THAT ON FOR A LIMITED TIME

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.179
IN PART BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TAKE

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.414
THE THINKING THAT HAS BEEN

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.314
HAPPENING BY THESE HUNDREDS OF

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.382
LEADERS.

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.483
AND WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.451
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.952
WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE HERE

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.721
TO ACTUALLY FIND A WAY TO

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.456
FORMALIZE THAT AND BRING IT INTO

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.624
PLACE SO THE TICKET SO THAT THE

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:16.491
AGENCIES.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:17.592
THAT NEED TO COOPERATE ARE

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.061
COOPERATING AND WHERE WE FIND

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.462
WHERE THERE'S FRICTION POINTS WE

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.030
HAVE A SYSTEM WITHIN THE STATE

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.465
THAT CAN RESOLVE THOSE.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.132
SO.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:26.768
THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF WHERE

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:30.205
WE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:31.740
ADVANCE THIS GOVERNANCE ELEMENTS

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.542
SO WE'RE GETTING NOT JUST BETTER

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.576
IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS ARE

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.710
STRATEGIES BUT BETTER AND HOW IT

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.279
TURNS WE MANAGE GOVERNMENT

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.648
OVERSEE THIS. TO THAT END ONE

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:41.116
FINAL ELEMENT ON THIS SECOND

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.484
POINT --

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.086
OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.153
THE SUMMIT DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.621
THE CALIFORNIA DREAMIN TAX WE

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:47.756
STARTED WORKING ON THIS ABOUT

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.324
TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE WE SAID WE

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.859
WERE ALL IMPRESSED BY THIS IDEA

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:51.993
THAT A FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.595
PUT OUT A METRIC WE WANT TO

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:54.496
REDUCE CARBON.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.598
EMISSIONS BY AXE AND IT DROVE

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.467
POLICY IT DROVE INNOVATION IT

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.769
DROVE AMBITION AND DROVE IDEAS

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.671
AND IT DROVE INVESTMENT --

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.573
AND WE SAID WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.174
THE SAME EXACT THING FOR INCOME

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.677
INEQUALITY UPWARD MOBILITY

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.745
ECONOMIC SECURITY --

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:11.379
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AROUND WE

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:12.848
REALIZED BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.282
ALL THE DASHBOARDS OF ALL THE

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:15.383
INDICATORS WE ACTUALLY DON'T

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.384
MEASURE THOSE WE DON'T MEASURE

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.619
THOSE IN WAYS THAT ARE

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:18.587
PREDICATED BACK.

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:20.288
ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE ROUTE

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.890
DRIVERS OF THOSE INCLUDING

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.658
HEALTH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH THE

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:24.626
AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:25.961
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:26.962
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.163
AVAILABILITY OF JOBS AND SO

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.865
WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE FOR

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:30.832
HOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY MEASURE

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.234
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.401
IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S NOT YET

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.636
TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE WE NEED TO

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.071
GET IT THERE BUT I WANT I WANT

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:37.939
TO SUGGEST AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.975
OWN IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:40.842
FORMALIZE OUR GOVERNANCE

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:41.276
STRUCTURE.

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.844
PLEASE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY HOW

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.446
ARE WE GONNA MEASURE THIS.

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:46.214
IN A IN AB NINE OH SIX AND

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:47.616
YOU'RE IN THE FIRST DRAFT HERE

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:48.583
THAT WAS SUBMITTED JUST A WEEK

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.118
AGO IT CALLS OUT FOR TRIPLE

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.520
BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS WHICH

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.854
WOULD SUGGEST WHEN YOU TROUBLE

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.456
BOTTOM LINE METRICS.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.624
SO FINDING A THIRD AND I WANT TO

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:56.992
TOUCH JUST UP FOR A COUPLE

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.360
MINUTES ON THIS IDEA THAT.

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.561
THERE HAS TO BE AN URGENCY TO

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.595
INNOVATE AND A GREAT AND

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:04.799
ACCELERATE THE CONNECTION

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:05.400
BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.802
DEVELOPMENT --

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.271
IT DID CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN THE

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:09.938
SUMMIT HAS BEEN GREATLY INVOLVED

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:10.539
IN THIS WORKING WITH MISTER

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:11.640
LANDER AND HIS TEAM WORKING WITH

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.674
THE EDGE COALITION THERE'S LOTS

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.409
OF ENERGY AND GOOD PROGRESS THAT

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.744
IS BEING MADE BOTH ON IMPROVING

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:16.945
THE WORKFORCE.

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.880
PIPELINE CONNECTING THE VARIOUS

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.682
SILOS WITHIN THE WORKFORCE WORLD

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.450
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE A KEY

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:23.919
ELEMENT TO THIS AND I'VE BEEN

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.887
REALLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS --

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:26.521
BUT WHAT WE'VE REALLY DISCOVERED

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:30.058
AS WE IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.360
FIGURE OUT IN REALLY MEANINGFUL

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:33.528
WAYS HOW TO IMPROVE THE

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.764
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.332
AND THIS AND THE STRUCTURE.

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.833
AND IT'S GOT TO BE MUCH DEEPER

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.602
THAN AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE IT'S

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.304
GOT TO BE MUCH THE DEEPER THAN

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.272
OCCASIONAL CONSULTATION --

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:45.340
AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WERE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.742
YOU SEE THE GREATEST GAINS THEY

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.077
ARE WORKING A DEEP PARTNERSHIP

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.312
TO UNDER DANCE UNDERSTAND THE

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:51.913
SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED TO DO

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.816
VERY TARGETED REMEDIAL EDUCATION --

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.151
TO THEN PROVIDE THE TRAINING

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.319
THAT'S NEEDED TO GET PEOPLE INTO

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.921
JOBS THAT PAY WELL WITH BENEFITS

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:00.855
AND THEN MOVE ON UP THE CAREER

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:01.556
LADDER.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.924
AND NOT ONLY IS THAT FIGHT AND

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.826
WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE PIPELINES

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.027
BEGAN WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:07.662
THE DISCONNECTED USE AND THE

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:08.697
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T SHOWING UP A

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:09.898
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOORS THEY'RE

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:10.999
NOT SHOWING UP AT WORKFORCE

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:12.300
INVESTMENT BOARDS.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.568
THE MOST EXCITING PROJECTS ARE

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:14.869
WE'RE GOOD WILL OR SOME OTHER

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:15.804
COMMUNITY --

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.039
ENTITY IS DRIVING IS THAT IS THE

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:19.274
FRONT END OF THAT PIPELINE.

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.209
THIS IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT AGAIN

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.844
TO REMEDY THIS CHALLENGE WE HAVE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.512
AROUND FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:25.947
MAKING A MINIMUM WAGE AND IT

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:29.217
TAKES TO MINIMUM WAGE IN THE

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:29.818
CHEAPEST PARTS OF THE STATE TO

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:30.485
PAY RENT --

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.419
BUT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.488
ALLOW US TO ADAPT THE FIRST

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.089
PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA KNOW THE

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.157
IMPACT OF A I REALLY EMPLOYERS

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.492
THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.227
KNOW THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL TRADE.

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:40.662
IS GOING TO BE THE EMPLOYERS IF

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.696
WARRANTY PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.732
OR ABILITY TO RESPOND IS GOING

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:45.133
TO BE MUCH FASTER MUCH GREATER --

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.468
AND DISK AND THIS GOES MUCH

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:47.936
BEYOND KIND OF MIDDLE SKILLED

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:48.970
WORKERS ARE ADVANCED

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.972
MANUFACTURING THIS APPLIES TO

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:52.407
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING --

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:53.441
ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH OUR

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:55.877
STARTED TO BUILD THE DATA

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.545
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.047
DO THIS AND THE GOVERNOR IS PUT.

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:00.048

THE DATA THAT COMES OUT OF THIS.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:07.856

FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.804

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.042
THIS IS REALLY MET TO TARGETED

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:30.645
FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT THE

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.580
TAXED TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:33.548
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.183
STRIDES OVER THE LAST FIVE TO

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:36.751
TEN YEARS INVESTING IN COMMUNITY

INVESTING IN K. TWELVE INVESTING

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:41.723
IN HIGH A HUGE PART OF OUR

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.758
POPULATION THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:47.495
ATTACHED AND ABLE --

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:48.196
TO TO TO BENEFIT FROM ANY OF

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:50.665
THAT INVESTMENT SO THIS --

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:52.800
THIS IDEA IS REALLY THE BEST OF

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:54.268
BOTH WORLDS IN OUR OPINION IT

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.370
PAIRS COMMUNITY BASED

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.271

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:11.686
THOSE.

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:13.354
THE TRUST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.323
THE IDEA IS THAT THE CBO'S WOULD

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:16.257
BRING THEM INTO THE WORKFORCE

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.092

INTEREST IN THE CRYPT HALFWAY

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.778

CHALLENGE AND THAT'S THE

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.843
PIPELINE TO THE FUTURE FIVE TO

HONOR COLLEGE FOR ALL BUT I

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:40.061
THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE. TO

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.729
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IF YOU GOOGLE

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:42.930
RIGHT NOW AND I JUST DID THIS

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:44.332
THE OTHER NIGHT FOR PRESENTATION

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:45.800
I'M DOING ON THE FUTURE OF WORK.

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:48.402
IF YOU GOOGLE CAREER NIGHT HIGH

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.871
SCHOOL CAREER NIGHT.

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.706
AND YOU LOOK AT THE FLYERS AND

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:54.242
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY ADVERTISE

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:55.643
IT'S ALL ABOUT COLLEGE PREP.

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.144
I JUST RECENTLY ATTENDED A

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:59.046

HAWAII. TO NEW YORK CITY --

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:07.922

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.657
SHIFT THE SCRIPT ON WHAT IT

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:11.392
MEANS ON HOW WE HONOR WORK

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:14.695

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:09.984
IT'S ALL VERY DESPERATE IT'S ALL

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:11.919
VERY ON CONNECTED WE DO NOT HAVE

A SYSTEM.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:13.888

IF WE APPLY HE SWISS MODEL IN

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.164
CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.265
SWITZERLAND --

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.100
WE RUN SOME NUMBERS CALIFORNIA

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:28.035
WOULD HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.270
FIFTY THOUSAND APPRENTICES.

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:31.405
BUSINESSES WOULD INVEST ABOUT

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:32.773
EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.374

STUDENT DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED BY

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:52.827

ADDITIONAL SKILLED TRAINING KNOW

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.257
WHERE TO GO AND WHAT THE OUTCOME

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.859
OF THAT IS.

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:26.660
WE ALSO --

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.261
WILL BE SUPPORTING WE ALSO

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:38.171
THINK -- AND

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:39.840
LEARN STRATEGIES OR OR KIND OF

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:42.075
REALLY THE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:44.711
TO PREPARE AND TO A MOVE PEOPLE

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.847
ALONG A WORKFORCE PIPELINE WITH

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:47.381
THE BEAUTY.

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.882
THE BEAUTY OF EARN AND LEARN

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:50.984
STRATEGIES IS PEOPLE GETTING

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.719
PAID WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING IT'S

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.454
BECAUSE MOST OF THE MOST PEOPLE

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.156
WHO ARE MAKING FORTY DOLLARS AN

01:44:56.223 --> 01:44:57.257
HOUR CAN'T LEAVE.

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.359
LEAVES --

THE VALUE OF WE ALSO THINK THE

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:09.369
VALUE AND THERE'S A GREAT VALUE

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:10.971
AND IN DEVELOPING THESE PRE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.806
APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:15.242
THEY ARE PATHWAYS. FOR HIGH

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.610
SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR WAY

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:18.745
AND THERE'S ANOTHER STRATEGY

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:19.980
THAT CAN.

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:22.082
CAN REALLY DIVERSIFY THE WORK

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.850
FORCE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:24.951
MOVING PEOPLE WHO WHO HAVE NOT

TRADITIONALLY GONE INTO THESE

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:28.055
FIELDS.

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:30.724
INTO INTO IT A RANGE OF FIELDS.

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.859
AND FINALLY OUR THIRD THING THAT

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.728
WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR TODAY IS

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:35.829
THE CREATION OF A STATE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:37.631
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THERE'S

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:39.032
BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:40.767
CREATE FOR YEARS ABOUT CREATING

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:43.503
A STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM.

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:48.008
AND AND OR OR NETWORK.

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:51.311
OF SUPPORTERS REALLY BELIEVE

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:54.214

DOING SO I MEAN YOU KNOW POP IN

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.218
RESEARCHERS WANTED AND AND A LOT

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.786
OF OTHER YOU KNOW I THINK POLICY

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.321
MAKERS WOULD LIKE A LONGITUDINAL

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:02.456
DATA SYSTEM.

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:04.057
SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:05.692
INVESTMENTS THAT THAT --

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:07.794

BUT THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC NEEDS

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:15.836
TO HAVE ACCESS SO THAT THAT IS

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.738
STUDENT WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING TO

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.239

OVER CREATING THIS LONGITUDINAL

01:46:34.821 --> 01:46:36.656
DATA SYSTEM THAT YOU REALLY

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.291

AND ALSO THAT IT IS BROADER THAN

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:47.601
JUST THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.669
SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY.

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.972

WE HAVE TODAY.

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:34.234
WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY DESIGNED

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:35.669
OUR PROGRAMS.

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:37.003
I'D I WOULD YOUR FROM THE

EMPLOYER INPUT.

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:44.377
INTO KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING

AND AND THAT BECAUSE AND AND

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:55.956
SOMETIMES THE WRONG PEOPLE ARE

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:58.191
SITTING AT THE TABLE SO IF IT IS

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:00.927
A HUGE IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.

THEM ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.023
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STRONG WORK

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.157
FORCE OUTCOMES THEY LINED WITH

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:33.960
THE WHEEL OUTCOMES INTENTIONALLY.

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:35.128
AND THEY INCLUDED DID THEY GET A

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:01.721
ARE USING EVERY DIME TO IMPROVE

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:02.956
THEIR RESULTS BECAUSE THEY WANT

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:04.557
THEIR 17%.

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:07.127
AND INTERMEDIARIES ARE IT IS

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:08.828
ASSOCIATIONS THAT --

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.163
THAT LIKE IT'S COALITION AND

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:11.698
LIKE THE WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:13.199
BUT ALSO THE REGIONAL CIVIC

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:15.168
LEADERS EVERYONE OF OUR REGIONAL

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:17.637
PARTNERS IS ENGAGED IN WORKFORCE.

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:18.972
AND AS MISTER NEAL CAN TELL YOU

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:20.440
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:22.008
BRINGING TOGETHER THE SYSTEMS.

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:23.977
AND USING THEIR OWN POLITICAL

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:25.278
CAPITAL AT A SCALE WHERE THIS

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:26.513
MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHICH IS

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:28.181
COMMUNITY AND REGION IN ORDER

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:30.216
SAY LOOK WE'VE GOT THE NEED

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:31.484
WE'VE GOT THE DOLLARS WE'VE GOT

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:32.585
THE INCENTIVES WERE DRIVING

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:33.520
TOWARDS THE OUTCOMES WHAT DOES

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:34.454
IT TAKE.

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:36.089
YOU CAN'T ENGINEER IT FROM HERE

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:37.624
BUT YOU CAN CREATE THE STRUCTURE

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.092
AND WHICH STORE LEADERS AT A

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:40.693
REGIONAL COMMUNITY SCALE CAN

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.195
WORK WITH THESE ASSOCIATIONS TO

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:44.898
MOVE THE NEEDLE BUT YOU'VE GOT

01:51:44.964 --> 01:51:46.399
TO BE DELIBERATE ABOUT IT.

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:47.634
AND I WOULD JUST ADD ONE MORE

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:48.802
THING TO THAT --

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:52.172
I SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS --

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:54.174
LAST WEEK WITH THE KRYCEK

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.675
EDUCATION CONSORTIUM THE STATE'S

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.610
AND WITH MANY SUPERINTENDENTS A

01:51:57.677 --> 01:51:58.545
HIGH SCHOOL'S FROM ACROSS THE

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:00.080
COUNTRY WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT.

01:52:00.146 --> 01:52:02.215
HOW DO WE GET OUR HIGH SCHOOL

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:03.116
STUDENTS WORKPLACE READY?

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:05.785
AND THE MORE I START THINKING

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.487
ABOUT THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:08.988
THE A THREE G. REQUIREMENTS AND

01:52:09.055 --> 01:52:10.056
HOW.

01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:11.925
HOW HIGH WE HOLD THEM UP --

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:13.927
WHEN WHEN MY STUDENTS REGISTER

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.962
FOR CLASSES EVERY YEAR THEY STOP

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:17.864
BY THEIR COUNSELORS DESK AND

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.165
THEY GET HANDED THE A THROUGH G.

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.834
REQUIREMENTS THEY DON'T GET

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.469
HANDED ANYTHING ABOUT C. T. E.

01:52:22.535 --> 01:52:23.403
PROGRAMS?

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.971
PROGRAMS OF STUDY--

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:26.439
AND THE FUTURE THAT WORK AND

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:27.807
BRING TO THEM SO WE NEED TO

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:30.743
INGRAIN WORK IN HIGH SCHOOLS.

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:32.879
LASTLY I THINK WE NEED TO THINK

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:35.315
ABOUT THE THE COUNSELORS AND

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:36.816
HIGH SCHOOLS CALIFORNIA.

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:40.019
IS THE NATION'S LAST RATIO TO

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:41.721
COLLEGE CAREER COUNSELORS TO

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:43.389
STUDENTS NINE HUNDRED AND

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.258
SEVENTY SEVEN STUDENTS TO EVERY

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:46.092
CAREER COUNSELOR.

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:48.561
AND AND THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:50.396
AND SO IF THERE IS A WAY THAT

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:51.564
THESE INTERMEDIARIES THESE

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.399
WORKFORCE BOARDS CAN GET INTO

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.535
THE HIGH SCHOOL AND PROVIDE

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.270
CAREER COUNSELING.

01:52:57.337 --> 01:52:58.905
LIKE THEY DO IN OTHER STATES AND

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:01.107
SOUTH CAROLINA --

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:03.176
I THINK THAT WOULD BE FABULOUS

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:03.710
SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:05.678
THOUGHTS.

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.280
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD A

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:09.048
THOUGHT ABOUT --

01:53:09.115 --> 01:53:11.084
FUNDING AND AND I I THINK THAT

01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:14.020
LOOKING AT OUTCOMES IS HUGE AND

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.788
LATE BUT IT'S COMPLICATED AND IF

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:17.357
WE REALLY WANT TO CLOSE EQUITY

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:18.925
GAPS YOU YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:19.893
CAREFUL.

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:21.394
ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK AT THOSE

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:25.165
OUTCOMES SO THAT YOUR AND YOU SO

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:27.033
YOU'RE NOT DOING THE WRONG THING.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.236
BECAUSE IT FUNDING IS TO TIED TO

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.704
TWO QUARTERS CERTAIN OUTCOMES

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:33.039
THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT REACHING

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:34.774
THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO REACH TO

01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:36.609
BREAK THE CYCLES OF POVERTY WE

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:37.277
HAVE IN THE STATE.

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:38.978
SO IT'S I I AGREE THAT WE HAVE

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.680
TO LOOK AT OUTCOMES WE HAVE TO

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:42.215
HEAD THAT'S WHY WE DO NEED A

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:43.816
DATA SYSTEM WE HAVE BE VERY

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:46.019
CAREFUL BECAUSE WE'RE TRUMP WHAT

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:46.553
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS VERY

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:50.490
COMPLICATED.

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.425
VERY COMPARABLE.

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:53.026
TO THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M AN

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:54.294

RATHER THAN TRYING TO DISPLACE

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.673
THEM AT CERTAIN POINTS BUT AN

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:07.774
EARLY ON THROUGH --

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.675
HIGH SCHOOL --

TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:18.117
FUTURE OF GOING ON TO ATTAIN

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.052
YOUR COLLEGE DEGREES THAT'S

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:19.752

THAT.

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.551
ALSO WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT --

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.620
THE EDUCATION AND MOVING FORWARD

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:55.288
ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS I THINK

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:55.888
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:57.724
TALKING ABOUT IN COLLEGE --

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:59.859
AND AFFORDABILITY THIS THERE IS

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:01.160
LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:02.795
PART TIME STUDENTS THERE ARE

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:03.863
ALSO THERE.

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:05.632
PART TIME STUDENTS THAT NOW MAY

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:07.166
BE ON IN THEIR LIFE FIGURE THEY

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:08.501
NEED TO GET YOU KNOW INTO

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:10.169
EDUCATION SEE THOSE THINGS BUT

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:11.271
NOW THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR A

01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:12.438
FAMILY THEY'RE WORKING THEY'RE

01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:13.539
DOING THOSE THINGS.

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.041
SO LET'S NOT FORGET WHEN WE

01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:16.943
START TO MOVE FORWARD TO BRING

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:17.977
THE TOPIC AROUND HIGHER

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:20.446
EDUCATION LET'S NOT FORGET THE

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:21.414
PART TIME STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.416
THERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:24.951
THEIR LIVES ALSO.

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.286
IN THE BIGGER IT MAKES ITS THERE

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.720
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:30.590
POINTS THAT I WANTED TO TO RAISE

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:33.359
MINIATURE.

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:34.661
YEAH I HAVE SEVERAL FOLLOW UP

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:35.695
QUESTIONS A HOW DO WE BEST

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:39.599
PREPARE OUR WORK FORCE --

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.933
FOR THINGS LIKE ARTIFICIAL

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.335
INTELLIGENCE WHICH A JIM

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:44.871
MENTIONED EARLIER ROBOTICS AND

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.739
AUTOMATION AS A HOLD.

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:48.308
CAN WE INCORPORATE THOSE --

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.343
THINGS INTO YOUR APPRENTICESHIPS --

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:51.844
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS SOME

01:55:51.911 --> 01:55:53.513
OF THE CHANNELS THAT WE CAN DO

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:55.715
THAT WITH.

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.816
SO --

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:59.285
EXCELLENT QUESTION --

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:00.953
SO WOMEN CHILD SO.

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.656
THAT THE THE FOURTEEN WORKFORCE

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:05.591
REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:08.061
THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN --

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:10.063
ORGANIZED THE FORTY FIVE

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:11.531
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S IN

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:12.832
TO FOURTEEN REGIONS --

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.367
SEVERAL YEARS AGO COMMUNITY

01:56:14.434 --> 01:56:15.902
COLLEGES ARE WORKING REGIONALLY

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:18.371
AS WELL ADULT SCHOOLS --

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.939
TO ARE BEGINNING TO PULL

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:21.641
INDUSTRY SECTORS TOGETHER AND I

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:22.942
THINK THE KEY IS YOU NEED TO

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:24.243
HAVE MORE THAN JUST ONE EMPLOYER

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:25.578
BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A GROUP OF

01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:26.946
INDUSTRIES --

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:30.316
WHETHER ITS MANUFACTURING THE OR

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:32.852
EVEN RETAIL GROCERY TO TALK

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.687
ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT THEY ARE

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:37.323
SEEING COMING DOWN THE PIPE --

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:39.559
JIM SAID IT EARLIER BUSINESSES

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:41.127
OF THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:42.995
THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATION THE

01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:44.197
EFFECTS OF A AYE.

01:56:44.263 --> 01:56:45.231
AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SHOULD

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:46.599
BE ABLE TO DICTATE THE

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.401
CURRICULUM THAT'S TAUGHT TO OUR

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:50.770
YOUNG PEOPLE AND ARE ADULTS ON

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.305
WHAT THEY NEED TO GET INTO THOSE

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:53.406
JOBS.

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:55.408
SO WE HAVE TO ENGAGE BUSINESS AT

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:57.377
A AT A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL AND

01:56:57.443 --> 01:56:58.644
IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN AROUND

01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:00.012
SOME OF THE SECTOR INITIATIVES

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:01.147
AND ONE THING THE STATE OF

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.281
CALIFORNIA CAN DO.

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.817
IS TO ADOPT A SECTOR STRATEGY

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:05.918
APPROACH --

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:08.588
AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR DOING

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:10.590
WORKFORCE IN EDUCATION AND

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:11.090
REGION'S DROUGHT STATE.

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:12.859
I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD I THINK

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:15.495
THAT EURO AS WE AS THESE

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:17.063
INDUSTRIES CHANGE.

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.631
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DO JOBS BUT

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:19.799
THEY'LL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.768
OUT OF JOBS AND TO THE EXTENT

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:22.902
THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A

01:57:22.969 --> 01:57:25.271
STRATEGY OF HOW TO BRING.

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:29.308
A WORKFORCE TRAINING TO THE

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.177
EMPLOYER.

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:32.278
EMPLOYMENT SO THAT WE CAN UP

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:35.114
SKILL AND AND AND TRANSITION AS

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:35.748
MANY BETWEEN NOT EVERYONE WILL

01:57:35.815 --> 01:57:36.349
BE.

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:38.284
CAPABLE OF THAT TRANSITION YEAH

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:39.619
WE HAVE I THINK MENTIONED

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:40.720
EARLIER WAS EMPLOYMENT TRAINING

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.088
PANEL PROGRAM.

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:46.359
THAT HAS RESOURCES FOR THAT BUT

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:48.227
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY THEY WE

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:49.595
GET THIS YEAR I THINK OR THIS

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:50.129
YEAR THERE'S ABOUT NINETY

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:51.097
MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES TO

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:52.565
RETRAINING --

01:57:52.632 --> 01:57:54.333
AND ITS PERFORMANCE BASED AND

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.469
IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM BUT REALLY

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:57.737
AS WE'RE THINKING OF THE SCOPE

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:59.839
OF THIS OVER THE YEARS HAT YOUR

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:02.041
TO RETHINK OUR INVESTMENTS AND

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.476
THE WAYS IN WHICH WE TRY TO

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:04.310
LEVERAGE.

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:06.245
NOT JUST GOVERNMENTAL MONEY BUT

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:08.414
LEVERAGE IMPORTANT ASSONANCE IN

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:10.283
IN TANDEM TO RETRAIN THEIR

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.918
CURRENT WORK FORCE BECAUSE

01:58:11.984 --> 01:58:13.586
THAT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:14.921
BE A DO ALLEGE PROBLEM.

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:17.857
LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID A TWENTY

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:20.593
SIX MEETINGS SELECT CREATE AN

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.261
ONLINE COLLEGE WITH EMPLOYERS

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:23.429
AND COMMUNITY LEADERS.

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:25.198
THAN NOT MOST COMMON REFRAIN WAS

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.666
THEY SAW THIS IS VERY VALUABLE

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.301
INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO WHAT BOB

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:29.869
AND RUN IT JUST SAID.

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:31.337
THAT HAVE SOLD SOME OF THIS IS

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:32.972
WHAT CAN WE TEACH THAT THAT IS

01:58:33.039 --> 01:58:34.440
ABOUT ENTREPRENEURIAL AND BILLY

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:36.242
TO LEARN AND ABILITY TO ADAPT.

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:37.276
SOME OF THAT IS CREATING THE

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:38.611
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:39.312
PARTNERSHIP SO WE CAN REACT

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:40.213
QUICKLY.

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:41.147
YEAH IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:42.648
MORE THING --

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:43.816
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:58:43.883 --> 01:58:45.017
THAT RUN A SAID.

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:47.587
HISTORICALLY A LOT OF THAT AND

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:48.287
WE CALLED INCUMBENT WORKER

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:50.089
TRAINING A LOT OF THAT INCOME

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:51.290
BUT WORKER TRAINING IS LOOKED ON

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:54.827
AS CORPORATE WELFARE YOU KNOW

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:55.828
HOW DO WE YOU KNOW.

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:58.164
SUPPORT BUSINESSES UPGRADING

01:58:58.231 --> 01:59:00.366
THEIR OWN TALENT --

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:01.501
AND PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE

01:59:01.567 --> 01:59:02.768
BUSINESSES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

01:59:02.835 --> 01:59:04.437
FOR DOING THAT HOWEVER I THINK

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.506
WE SEE THAT IF IF THAT IF IT'S

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:07.707
NOT A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:09.575
GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS WERE

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:10.743
LEFT WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.144
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A HUGE

01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:15.414
SEGMENT.

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:16.048
OF OUR POPULATION IS BEING LEFT

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:17.817
BEHIND.

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.652
CAN I ADD TO THAT I'D SAY THAT

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:21.254
ALSO HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF THE

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.655
HUGEST INDUSTRIES WHERE WE HAVE

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.323
WORKFORCE THESE ESPECIALLY WELL

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:25.191
PAYING MIDDLE SKILL WORKFORCE

01:59:25.258 --> 01:59:27.927
THESE AND MOST OF HEALTHCARE.

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.462
DOESN'T PAY INTO THE APPOINTMENT

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:31.764
TRAINING FUND AND IS CAN IS NOT

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:35.001
ELIGIBLE FOR RESOURCES TO

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:37.336
UPGRADE THEIR THEIR WORKFORCE.

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:38.070
AND TO TRAIN THEIR WORKFORCE

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:39.405
ABOUT THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:41.774
HAVE IS A WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:44.810

BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:34.900
A CON IS AN ECONOMY OF REGIONS

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.902
AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN CREATE

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:38.237
POLICY --

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:40.039

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:49.081
ECONOMIC --

02:04:49.148 --> 02:04:50.149
MILIEU.

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:53.018
MY MEMBERS ARE THE LARGER

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:54.153
EMPLOYERS OF THE INLAND EMPIRE --

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.889
THE INLAND EMPIRE IS TWENTY

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.691
SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES --

02:04:58.757 --> 02:04:59.892
SABATINO COUNTY THE SIZE OF

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.093
ISRAEL --

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.728
RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE SIZE OF NEW

ACCORDING TO THE U. S.

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.167
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS ON OUR WAY

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:09.268
TO SIX POINT.

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:13.739
FIVE BY --

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:14.373
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY FORTY

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.741
BUT A REGION'S OF OVER MILLION

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:17.042
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE LOWEST

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:18.544
BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT IN THE

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:19.478
COUNTRY.

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:22.348
AND SO THAT IS A LIMITING FACTOR --

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:24.950
ON THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY THAT WE

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.752
CAN WE CAN HALF --

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:27.920
WE ARE --

02:05:27.987 --> 02:05:29.154
THEREFORE VERY --

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:31.857
BLUE COLLAR DEPENDENT REGION --

BLUE COLLAR JOBS AND HEALTH CARE.

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:39.999
ARE REALLY --

02:05:40.065 --> 02:05:42.167
THE FOCUS OF OUR ORGANIZATION.

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:43.869
AND WE DO PUBLIC POLICY IN

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:45.437
WASHINGTON AND HERE FOR OUR

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:46.739
MEMBERS --

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:48.507
BUT WE'RE ALSO HEAVILY INVOLVED

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:50.242
IN THIS ISSUE OF EDUCATION AND

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:52.211
WORK FORCE --

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:55.748
BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO MY MEMBERS

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:58.484
AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN --

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.319
GET THIS RIGHT I THINK --

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:03.722
THE BETTER WE WILL BE --

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:06.358
GROWTH AS OUR REGION --

02:06:06.425 --> 02:06:08.861
I TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.496
PRESSURE OF A LOW BACCALAUREATE

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:11.997
ATTAINMENT --

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:14.233
OF REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.635
THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS THE FOURTH

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:18.203
LARGEST LATINO POPULATION LOS

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:21.173
ANGELES NEW YORK HOUSTON AND THE

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:21.707
INLAND EMPIRE.

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.976
AND YET DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:26.245
LATINOS ARE AFFECTED BY THAT --

02:06:26.312 --> 02:06:27.780
BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT ISSUE

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:28.714
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.716
ABOUT EQUITY ISSUES --

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.718
DISPROPORTIONATELY NOT A LOT OF

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:35.120
FOCUS BEING PUT ON THAT HALF OF

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:36.555
OUR POPULATION TWO POINT TWO

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:37.656
MILLION.

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:40.259
AND ALL OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:41.760
IMPORTANT --

02:06:41.827 --> 02:06:43.028
BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT AS

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.797
CALIFORNIA'S LATINO POPULATION

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:47.199
GROWS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.801
ARE FINDING WAYS THAT --

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:49.435
WE CAN --

02:06:49.501 --> 02:06:50.803
CHANGE --

02:06:50.869 --> 02:06:51.870
THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:54.039

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.442
AND AND MY BUSINESS MEMBERS WILL

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:57.543
TELL YOU WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:58.911
LEADERSHIP BENCH --

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:02.748
THEY KNOW THAT THE THAT --

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:06.919
MINORITIES ARE.

02:07:06.986 --> 02:07:08.654
COUPLE OF THINGS TWO THINGS FROM

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.222
THE SECOND TO PRESENTATION THAT

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.657
YOU SAW --

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:13.158
CALLED OUT --

02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:14.793
THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRIES --

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.428
THE GOODS MOVE IN INDUSTRY AS

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:19.098
GREATER LOS ANGELES --

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:20.899
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS ASSEMBLY

02:07:20.966 --> 02:07:22.234
MEMBER CERVANTES YOU KNOW.

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:23.168
HOW?

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:24.970
THE SUPPLY CHAIN AFFECTS THE

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:26.238
INLAND EMPIRE.

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:27.673
AND SO AS AS MISTER MAYOR IS

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:29.208
TALKING ABOUT THE FOCUS ON

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:30.776
REGIONS --

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.311
JUST IN THAT PRESENTATION AND NO

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:34.279
DISRESPECT OKAY --

02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:36.482
BUT WE HAVE TO DIG DEEPER INTO

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:39.084
GREATER LOS ANGELES IS TWENTY TO

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:40.219
TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.854
DEPENDING HOW YOU YOU --

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.222
LAID OUT --

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:45.591
HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S --

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.860
POPULATION LIVE SOUTH OF THE TWO

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:49.461
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE POLICY WE'RE

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.397
GOING TO TALK ABOUT OF THESE

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:53.632
ISSUES WE HAVE TO GET TO I THINK

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:55.300
A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL --

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:57.069
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:58.670
GOING TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS.

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.439
ON THE ISSUE OF EMPLOYER MEANING

02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:02.074
GAUGE MEANT EVERYTHING THAT THE

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:03.108
LAST PANEL SAID.

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:04.777
EMPLOYERS BEING ASKED TO ATTEND

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:06.712
TOO MANY MEETINGS NOT GETTING

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:08.714
THE OUTCOMES THAT THEY WANT --

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:10.616
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.918
AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO LOOK

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:14.253
AT OTHER MODELS OF HOW WE

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:17.689
REGIONAL LIVES --

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:18.690
AT THAT THE THAT THE SUBREGION

02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:20.059
LEVEL -- BUT

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:21.760
ALSO MAYBE BREAKING THE STATE

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.395
OFTEN TO YOU KNOW ELEVEN

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:24.830
DIFFERENT REGIONS SO THAT WE CAN

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.398
HAVE THESE.

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:28.267
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:30.602
LAST A PIECE AT ALL BRING UP IS --

02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:32.871
OF ALL THOSE PRESSURES ON THE

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:34.573
INLAND EMPIRE THE ONE THAT KEEPS

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.075
ME UP AT NIGHT IS THE RISE OF

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:37.242
THE ROBOTS.

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:38.677
AND IT IS AUTOMATION.

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:39.611
SO --

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.013
ACCORDING TO WORK DONE OUT OF

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.616
UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS --

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.252
65% OF OUR CURRENT JOBS COULD BE

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:51.023
AUTOMATED AWAY BY --

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:51.657
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE BROOKINGS

02:08:51.723 --> 02:08:54.793
INSTITUTE ANOTHER SURVEY THAT

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.628
SAID -- 47%

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.630
OF OUR JOBS DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE

02:08:58.697 --> 02:09:00.232
NOT GOING TO CREATE NEW JOBS WE

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:01.900
ARE GOING TO CREATE NEW JOBS.

02:09:01.967 --> 02:09:05.671
BUT WE NEED TO BE HYPER.

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:06.939
VIGILANT --

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:10.275
WEEK WE CANNOT WAIT --

02:09:10.342 --> 02:09:11.610
THE EXAMPLE I USE YESTERDAY TO

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:13.679
TALK IS WHEN'S THE LAST TIME ANY

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.380

GET MONEY RIGHT. FOR GENERATION

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:20.018
NOW WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE ATM

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.553
THAT WAS THE CUTTING EDGE OF

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:22.321
AUTOMATION.

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:25.157
AND WE SEE IT LITTLE BY LITTLE --

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.758
AND IT'S MEANT TO MAKE OUR LIVES

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.393
EASIER OKAY IT'S MEANT TO MAKE

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.795
OUR LIVES EASIER.

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:31.196
BUT IT DOES HAVE --

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:34.466
CONSEQUENCES FOR EMPLOYMENT --

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:36.702
THIS IS GREAT STATE AND IT'S A

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:38.370
BEAUTIFUL STATE AND WE HAVE SO

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:40.672

A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 50% OF

02:12:48.694 --> 02:12:51.096
THE EMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA WORKS

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.864

02:12:57.903 --> 02:13:01.006
AS AN ORGANIZATION WE FOCUS ON

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:04.843
WHAT I CALL THE GLOBAL ISSUES

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:06.945
THAT AFFECT ALL SMOKERS.

02:13:07.012 --> 02:13:07.813

RETIREMENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:10.515
FIVE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:13.318
THE ISSUES THAT --

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:14.653
ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO SMALL

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:17.422
BUSINESS AND SOME OF WHICH WE

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:18.657
CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON SO WE

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.726
WHICH WE CAN'T.

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:23.128
BUT EVERY YEAR THE NUMBER ONE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:25.430
ISSUE HAS BEEN AFFORDABILITY AND

02:13:25.497 --> 02:13:28.433

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.872
HIS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:35.907
WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING THOUGH

02:13:35.974 --> 02:13:37.843
IS WE LOOKED.

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:41.847
AT A WE GIVE A A LIST OF ISSUES

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.014
AND WHAT I THOUGHT REALLY

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.616
INTERESTING AS FAR AS SMALL

02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:46.885
BUSINESSES STORES ISSUES.

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:49.788

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:54.059
OF THINGS.

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:58.663

02:13:58.730 --> 02:14:00.665
QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AND

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:01.666
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SMALL

02:14:01.733 --> 02:14:02.968
BUSINESS YOU DON'T THINK OF THAT

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:05.270

THAT IS CRITICAL.

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:12.444
THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE THAT

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:14.112

INVOLVED IN HIM BACK --

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:09.234
WE'VE THIS YEAR OR FOCUSING --

FOCUSING ON ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:19.678

MOST OF US AND IT'S TO GET

02:16:16.668 --> 02:16:18.236

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:15.387
ON A STATE BASIS.

02:18:15.453 --> 02:18:16.955
AND THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO EACH

02:18:17.022 --> 02:18:19.257
OTHER SO THAT IS --

02:18:19.324 --> 02:18:20.592
THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THE

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:24.195
OTHER THE OTHER THING IS THAT

02:18:24.262 --> 02:18:25.530
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM.

02:18:25.597 --> 02:18:29.434
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT.

02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:31.069
BE HELPFUL AND I KNOW --

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:31.870
THIS IS BEING DONE TO SOME

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.371
DEGREE -- IN

02:18:33.438 --> 02:18:36.608
IN VARIOUS ENTITIES BUT LOOKING

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:38.510
AT THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE OUT

02:18:38.576 --> 02:18:40.545
OUT THERE IN STREAMLINING THEM

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:42.547
GETTING RID OF THE ONES THAT ARE --

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:44.582
NOT APPLE ICAL DUPLICATIONS

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.450
THOSE KIND OF THINGS

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:45.750
[inaudible]

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:49.954
THANK YOU.

02:18:50.021 --> 02:18:51.056
THANK YOU SO --

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:54.826
MANY MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT 64%

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.561
OF MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA

02:18:56.628 --> 02:18:57.696
ARE ACTUALLY.

02:18:57.762 --> 02:19:00.031
LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:02.300
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:03.435
BUSINESSES.

02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:05.403
IN OUR INDUSTRY AND THEY MAKE UP

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.706
THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND RELY ON OUR

02:19:07.772 --> 02:19:09.441
FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED OR LARGER

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:12.010
MANUFACTURERS --

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:13.878
FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD --

02:19:13.945 --> 02:19:16.915
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS SCOTT

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:18.817
WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT --

02:19:18.883 --> 02:19:20.285
ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT

02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:22.353
REGULATIONS COMING FROM VARIOUS

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.490
GOVERNMENT SOURCES AND SMALL

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.092
COMPANIES HAVING CHALLENGES.

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:28.860
TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THAT LET

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:30.595
ALONE ABOUT COMPLIANCE THEY

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.931
DON'T HAVE BIG H. R. DEPARTMENT

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:34.766
OR MAYBE EVEN AN HR PERSON IT

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:35.967
MIGHT JUST BE THE OWNER

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:37.469
THEMSELVES TRYING.

02:19:37.535 --> 02:19:39.404
TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING FROM

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:41.039
THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY TO

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:41.673
THE STATE AND EVEN THE FEDERAL

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.440
LEVEL.

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:44.142
SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS

02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:46.377
DEFINITELY TRYING TO MAKE SURE

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:48.146
THAT THERE'S COMPLY THAT NOT

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:49.314
COMPLIANCE I'M SORRY BUT THERE

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:50.782
IS COORDINATION.

02:19:50.849 --> 02:19:52.851
BETWEEN THOSE REGULATIONS THAT

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.686
THEY'RE NOT CONFLICTING OR

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:56.488
CREATING SOME CHALLENGES --

02:19:56.554 --> 02:19:59.324
WITH COMPLIANCE FOR THOSE --

02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:00.759
THOSE PRIORITIES AND POLICY

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:03.895
INITIATIVES BUT ALSO MAKING SURE

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.230
THAT BECAUSE THE SMALL

02:20:05.296 --> 02:20:06.598
MANUFACTURERS ARE SMALL

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:09.501
COMPANIES DON'T HAVE THESE H. R.

02:20:09.567 --> 02:20:10.535
PROFESSIONALS ARE DEPARTMENT.

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:12.403
THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:14.973
THEM TO CURE VERY MINOR

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.441
REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT BE PAPER

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:18.476
VIOLATIONS OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING

02:20:18.543 --> 02:20:19.744
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY

02:20:19.811 --> 02:20:21.579
THREATENING THE HATE HEALTH AND

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.281
SAFETY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WAR OR

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:26.484
THE WORK FORCE OR OR THEIR THEIR

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:27.919
CONSUMERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

02:20:27.986 --> 02:20:29.387
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:30.355
PROVIDE.

02:20:30.421 --> 02:20:33.958
YOUR WHERE IT IS REASON

02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:35.493
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.762
HELPFUL IN ADDITION TO THAT

02:20:37.829 --> 02:20:39.497
THERE IS THE STATE HAS --

02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:42.767
ENACTED A REVIEW OF REGULATION

02:20:42.834 --> 02:20:43.968
TO DETERMINE --

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:46.337

SEE THAT REVIEWED SO THAT YOU'RE

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:50.108
LOOKING AT ECONOMIC AND NON

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:52.143
ECONOMIC IMPACTS BECAUSE FOR THE

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:53.344
SMALLER GUYS.

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:56.114
THE WHAT THE REGULATIONS WHAT

02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:58.817
THE PURPOSE IS AND THEIR THEIR

02:20:58.883 --> 02:21:01.486
OUTCOME AND THEIR IMPACT IS VERY

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:03.221
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:05.290
COMPANIES WHO ARE RIGHT THERE ON

02:21:05.356 --> 02:21:06.591

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:12.730
SURE THAT THE REGULATIONS TARGET

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:14.432

VIABILITY OF THE SMALL COMPANIES

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:25.043
IS IMPORTANT TO BY LOOKING AT

02:21:25.109 --> 02:21:27.212

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:23.381
INLAND EMPIRE I THINK WE NEED TO

02:25:23.448 --> 02:25:24.649
SHOW THAT STORY.

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:25.950
A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WHEN WE DO

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:27.051
TALK ABOUT.

02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:29.687
AREAS IN GREATER LOS ANGELES AND

02:25:29.754 --> 02:25:30.288
THOSE ARE ALL GREAT BUT LET'S

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.623
NOT FORGET THAT THERE'S REGION'S

02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:33.591
RIGHT REGIONAL GOALS AND NEED TO

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:35.059
BE DONE.

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:37.528
WE COULD SET UP A STRUCTURE THAT

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:39.597
COULD FIT EACH REGION IN THE

02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:41.399
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HIGHLIGHT

02:25:41.466 --> 02:25:42.867
THOSE GOALS THAT ARE THERE JUST

02:25:42.934 --> 02:25:44.769
WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR

02:25:44.836 --> 02:25:46.471
PRESENTATION FOR YOUR DISCUSSION.

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.305
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK YOU'RE

02:25:47.371 --> 02:25:49.807

YEAR OLD.

02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:53.878
AND THIS ISSUE OF SKILLS

02:25:53.945 --> 02:25:56.180
DEVELOPMENT I KNOW WHAT SHE CAN

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.316
DO AND LEARN ON THE IPAD --

02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:00.184
HER MOTHER HAS A PHD --

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.786
I'VE GOT TO ADVANCED DEGREES IN

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:03.387
THEOLOGY OKAY --

02:26:03.454 --> 02:26:04.555
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE AGAINST

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:06.524
HIGHER ED --

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.426
BUT I HAVE TO TRY AND BE THE

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.261
BEST DAD I CAN'T AND MAKE SURE

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:12.196

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:14.132
SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE AND SO

02:26:14.198 --> 02:26:15.366
THIS ISSUE OF HOW WE BILLET%

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:17.068
SKILLS --

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:19.370
EXPERIENCE BE A ABILITY TO

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:21.639
COMMUNICATE TEAM WORK ALL OF

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:23.374
THAT HAS TO START VERY YOUNG SO --

02:26:23.441 --> 02:26:25.877
AND I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:28.079
ABOUT THE FOCUS ON REGION'S

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:30.081
APPROACH.

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:30.915
AND I DO WANT TO ADD ONS THAT

02:26:30.982 --> 02:26:31.716
THERE THERE HAVE BEEN VERY

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:33.985
SUCCESSFUL REGIONAL INITIATIVES

02:26:34.051 --> 02:26:35.887
THAT WE'VE READ A BALLOTS AND

02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:36.821
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BUILD ON THAT

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:38.523
AND I LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT

02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:40.324
OTHER REGIONS ARE DOING THAT ARE

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.125

SKILLED JOBS IN THE AREAS --

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:48.793
SUCH AS SAMBAR DO NO COUNTY

02:27:48.859 --> 02:27:50.494
RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR AFTER THE

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:51.929
RISE OF THE ROBOTS THIS IS THE

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:52.763
SECOND.

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:54.432
ONE THE KEEPS ME UP AND IT'S THE

02:27:54.498 --> 02:27:56.000
CHICKEN AND THE EGG SO.

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:57.301
MY WIFE WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY

02:27:57.368 --> 02:27:58.803
CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE IN THE

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:00.304
MEDICAL SCHOOL --

02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:02.573
YOU KNOW FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT

ARE GRADUATING AND WANT TO

02:28:03.808 --> 02:28:05.409
WORKING TACK IN THERE'S NO TECH

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:06.477
INDUSTRY.

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:08.179
SO THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE AND

02:28:08.246 --> 02:28:09.347
ARE GOING TO GO TO THE SILICON

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:12.049
VALLEY THEY'RE GOING TO GO --

02:28:12.116 --> 02:28:12.683
TO THE COAST BOSTON AND THEY'LL

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:16.087
GO I THINK.

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:18.055
AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THIS HOUSING

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.790
ISSUE AND AFFORDABILITY IN

02:28:19.857 --> 02:28:21.359
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO REALIZE

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:23.394
THAT THAT'S ALSO --

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:25.263
A CHOICE THAT THEY'RE MAKING --

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:26.564
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:28.065
MAKE THE MOST MONEY EARLY ON IN

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:30.167
THEIR CAREERS HOW AFFORDABLE IS

02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:32.470
CALIFORNIA --

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:33.771
YOU NO MATTER CHAIR YOU KNOW

02:28:33.838 --> 02:28:35.139
THAT -- A

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:37.508
HOUSE IN NORCO IT'S THREE

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:38.509
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

02:28:38.576 --> 02:28:39.977
DOLLARS AND RIGHT ACROSS THE

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:41.445
LINE -- THE

02:28:41.512 --> 02:28:42.680
SAME HOUSE.

02:28:42.747 --> 02:28:45.182
GAINES ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED

02:28:45.249 --> 02:28:46.384
THOUSAND BY JUST BEING AND AND

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:47.852
AN ORANGE COUNTY YOU DIDN'T EVEN

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:49.587
PAINTED IT'S THE SAME HOUSE

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:50.588
RIGHT --

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.523
THAT THAT THAT HAS A LIMITING

02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:54.525
FACTOR SO I THINK IT IS THE

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:56.360
EDUCATION WE'RE PRODUCING VERY

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:57.828
WELL EDUCATED --

02:28:57.895 --> 02:28:59.363
INDIVIDUALS --

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.765
BUT WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE

02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:02.400
BUSINESS TO SAY OKAY WELL THERE

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:04.235
ARE REGIONS WHERE IT'S CHEAPER

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:05.536
TO DO BUSINESS --

02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:06.904
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:29:06.971 --> 02:29:07.672
THEY HAVE THE WORK FORCE THAT

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:08.839
THEY NEED --

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:10.541
BUT IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:12.109
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE.

02:29:12.176 --> 02:29:17.248
OTHER ISSUES OF OF OF ALSO

02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:18.549
AFFECTING --

02:29:18.616 --> 02:29:20.117
THAT THAT THAT GROUP THAT WE'RE

02:29:20.184 --> 02:29:23.721
TALKING ABOUT.

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:25.389
SO IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR SO ONE

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:26.290
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:28.659
PRESENT IT WAS ABOUT RESTORING

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:30.895
AND MANUFACTURING AND HOW TO

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:34.332
REMOVE THESE BARRIERS AND SO --

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:36.067
AS THE FORMER SPEAKER JUST SAID

02:29:36.133 --> 02:29:38.102
YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:41.772
DIFFERENT PAIN POINTS --

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:42.940
TO IT TRACK TEAM BUSINESS

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:44.675
INVESTMENT INTO CALIFORNIA

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:46.210
THAT'S PROBABLY OUTSIDE THE

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:47.345
SCOPE OF THIS COMMITTEE'S

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:48.479
JURISDICTION.

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:49.480
AND PROBABLY CAN TAKE ITS OWN

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:50.781
HEARING --

02:29:50.848 --> 02:29:52.416
BUT GIVEN THE FACT AS OR AS AN

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:54.652
INDUSTRY ARE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE

02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:56.354
TO OUT OF STATE COMPETITION IT'S

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:58.622
HARD TO JUST CHOOSE ONE OR TWO

02:29:58.689 --> 02:30:00.758
PARTICULAR AREAS --

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:02.093
THAT COULD BE LIKE A SILVER

02:30:02.159 --> 02:30:03.461
BULLET TO REMOVING THESE

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:04.695
BARRIERS IT'S THE WHOLE

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:08.766
CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF OF THE END

02:30:08.833 --> 02:30:10.234
OF THE IMPACT THAT WE FEEL AS AS

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:12.436
COMPANIES --

02:30:12.503 --> 02:30:13.537
THAT MAKE IT CHALLENGING.

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:14.572
FOR WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:15.973
HOW TO ATTRACT SOME ADDITIONAL

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:18.109
MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT I ALSO

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:19.744
THINK IT'S NOTEWORTHY TO POINT

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.612
OUT THAT WHILE WE'RE SEEING RE

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:22.947
SHORING AND WE'RE SEEING MORE

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:24.682
MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT I THINK

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:28.252
IT'S UPWARDS OF 12% NATIONWIDE.

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:31.322
CALIFORNIA'S HALF OF THAT SO IT

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:33.824
IS A TIMELY CONVERSATION TO TO

02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:35.493
THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS.

02:30:35.559 --> 02:30:36.827
THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:39.864
INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE --

02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:40.965
SO HAVING SAID THAT

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:43.701
MANUFACTURERS NEED CERTAINTY AND

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:45.536
WE NEED PREDICTABILITY IN ORDER

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:46.704
TO THRIVE --

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:49.740
WE ENCOURAGE POLICYMAKERS TO

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:52.209
LOOK AT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:54.044
RESOLUTIONS AND SOLUTIONS FOR

02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:56.380
THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.149
ATTACK THE NARROW IN ISOLATED

02:30:58.215 --> 02:30:59.683
INCIDENTS IN THESE BROAD

02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:03.154
SWEEPING POLICY AND MISSION S. --

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:06.690
THAT ARE INCOME NATURE OF OUR

02:31:06.757 --> 02:31:08.225
MANUFACTURING --

02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:09.660
OPERATIONS --

02:31:09.727 --> 02:31:11.962
MANUFACTURING IS IN UNIQUE WE'RE

02:31:12.029 --> 02:31:13.330
NOT LIKE THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:14.799
WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU KNOW THE

02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:16.000
PROFESSIONAL --

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:18.936
OFFICE INDUSTRIES THAT YOU SEE --

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:20.838
OUR COMPETITION IS GLOBAL OUR

02:31:20.905 --> 02:31:23.574
JOBS ARE REQUIRE HIGH SKILL OUR

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:25.543
OPERATIONS ARE IT HERE TOO

02:31:25.609 --> 02:31:29.180
STRICT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES --

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:30.714
OR BUT OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS

02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:32.349
SUPPORT TWO POINT FIVE

02:31:32.416 --> 02:31:34.552
ADDITIONAL JOBS IN THE ECONOMY

02:31:34.618 --> 02:31:36.554
FOR EVERYONE MANUFACTURING JOB

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.489
THAT'S TWO POINT FIVE ADDITIONAL

02:31:38.556 --> 02:31:40.191
JOBS THAT WERE CREATING IN OUR

02:31:40.257 --> 02:31:41.325
COMMUNITIES.

02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:43.260
ARE OPERATIONS AS I SAID BEFORE

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:45.830
OUR SMALL THEY'RE NIMBLE.

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:47.198
AND FRANKLY ARE CALIFORNIA

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:50.434
CUSTOMERS CAN BE SERVICED FROM

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:51.435
ANYWHERE.

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:53.471
SO UNDERSTANDING THE UNIQUENESS

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:55.706
OF MANUFACTURING IS ONE OF THE

02:31:55.773 --> 02:31:56.941
THINGS THAT WE WANT TO EXPLORE

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:58.342
WITH THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR

02:31:58.409 --> 02:32:00.711
ARE TWO TOP PRIORITIES THIS YEAR

02:32:00.778 --> 02:32:02.580
OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:04.315
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE'RE

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:06.684
LOOKING AT WAYS TO BRING BACK

02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:08.385
INCENTIVIZE --

02:32:08.452 --> 02:32:09.553
INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:10.688
MANUFACTURING AND WE'RE LOOKING

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:13.224
AT WAYS TO BUILD OUT A SKILLED

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:15.292
WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:32:15.359 --> 02:32:16.760
THE CONCERNS ABOUT INCOME

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:18.496
INEQUALITY AND TO SHOW THE

02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:20.564
LEGISLATURE THAT WHILE WE ARE

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:23.067
BOTH USERS AND MAKERS OF THE

02:32:23.133 --> 02:32:24.468
TECHNOLOGY.

02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:27.304
WE ALSO HAVE A PLAN OF HOW OUR

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:29.340
WORKERS CAN WORK ALONGSIDE WITH

02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:31.308
THAT TECHNOLOGY BUT AGAIN THAT'S

02:32:31.375 --> 02:32:32.776
GOING TO REQUIRE EVEN HIGHER

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.645
SKILL SET WHICH IS GOING TO

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:36.247
CHALLENGE POLICY MAKERS. TO

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:37.915
INVEST EVEN MORE AND WORKFORCE

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:40.084
DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER GOALS SO

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.519
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

02:32:41.585 --> 02:32:42.953
HOPING TO ESTABLISH WITH EITHER.

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.455
YOU KNOW WHAT CONVERSATION WITH

02:32:44.522 --> 02:32:45.623
THE LEGISLATURE OR THE

02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:46.690
ADMINISTRATION IS A

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:48.392
MANUFACTURING COUNCIL BECAUSE WE

02:32:48.459 --> 02:32:50.094
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.630
NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE WE

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.832
FORECAST THESE TRENDS WE KNOW

02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:56.634
THESE --

02:32:56.700 --> 02:33:00.838
THESE PATHWAYS NEW OR SURPRISING

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:01.906
TO US BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

02:33:01.972 --> 02:33:03.974
ANTICIPATING IT BUT WE NEED A

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:06.076
FORM TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:07.511
WITH POLICYMAKERS SO

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:09.647
MANUFACTURING COUNCIL I HEARD

02:33:09.713 --> 02:33:11.015
EARLIER YOU KNOW IT'S BEYOND

02:33:11.081 --> 02:33:13.684
ADVISORY GROUPS WE TOTALLY AGREE.

02:33:13.751 --> 02:33:15.219
BUT WE DO NEED A STATE WIDE

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:17.321
PLACE ONE PLACE SO WE'RE NOT AT

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:18.622
MULTIPLE TABLES WHICH WAS SAID

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:20.925
BEFORE WHERE WE CAN CONVENE AND

02:33:20.991 --> 02:33:23.093
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT IS A

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.295
CORNERSTONE INDUSTRY OF

02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:25.563
CALIFORNIA.

02:33:25.629 --> 02:33:27.464
THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE TO THIS

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:28.799
IS THAT WE OFTEN HEAR

02:33:28.866 --> 02:33:30.134
CALIFORNIANS THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.435
ECONOMY.

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.771
WE NEED TO OF DEVELOP A NATION

02:33:33.837 --> 02:33:36.640
STATE MENTALITY AND IN ORDER TO

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:38.509
HAVE A STRONG AND SUSTAINABLE

02:33:38.576 --> 02:33:41.245
NATION STATE WE HAVE TO HAVE A

02:33:41.312 --> 02:33:43.881
PRODUCTION INDUSTRY A STRONG AND

02:33:43.948 --> 02:33:46.183
SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION INDUSTRY

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.318
THAT'S WHAT MANUFACTORY

02:33:47.384 --> 02:33:48.452
REPRESENTS.

02:33:48.519 --> 02:33:50.487
AND THAT'S WERE WERE EXCITED TO

02:33:50.554 --> 02:33:53.257
COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK WITH

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:53.891
YOU ABOUT THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:33:53.958 --> 02:33:55.993
INSIGHT --

02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:57.061
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.863
WAS TALKING --

02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:01.999
TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THE

02:34:02.066 --> 02:34:03.400
METAL TRADES INDUSTRY.

02:34:03.467 --> 02:34:05.502
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE

02:34:05.569 --> 02:34:08.205
SAID IS THAT.

02:34:08.272 --> 02:34:12.142
A LOT IF NOT MOST OF THE PEOPLE

02:34:12.209 --> 02:34:13.143
THAT ARE MEMBERS BECAUSE

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:14.945
ASSOCIATION HAVE A BACKUP

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.614
STRATEGY --

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.782
FOR MOVING.

02:34:18.849 --> 02:34:20.718
OR FOR EXPANDING WITH ANOTHER

02:34:20.784 --> 02:34:22.453
AREA AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:34:22.519 --> 02:34:25.756
THAT LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:26.056
[inaudible]

02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:26.957
THAT.

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:28.392
IT'S COMPETITION OUT THERE

02:34:28.459 --> 02:34:29.660
PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:31.528
CALIFORNIA THESE PEOPLE WANT TO

02:34:31.595 --> 02:34:33.497
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:34.898
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEIR

02:34:34.965 --> 02:34:37.668
BUSINESSES THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND

02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:40.270
SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A SAID

02:34:40.337 --> 02:34:42.640
IS DEVELOPING BACKUP STRATEGIES

02:34:42.706 --> 02:34:43.774
THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE WORK

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:48.545
AFTER EXPAND WHERE THEY CAN AGO

02:34:48.612 --> 02:34:48.846
[inaudible]

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:49.747
MICHIGAN.

ENTREPRENEURS [inaudible]

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:15.199
GOOD QUESTION.

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:16.600
YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE I'VE HAD TO

02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:19.369

02:36:19.937 --> 02:36:21.305
DRIVE [inaudible]

02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:28.278

02:36:28.345 --> 02:36:29.713
THIS IN WOMEN THAN I WOULD --

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:31.415
KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE --

02:36:31.482 --> 02:36:33.817
I I I HAVE LEARNED TO LISTEN TO

02:36:33.884 --> 02:36:35.686
MY MILLENNIAL STAFF RIGHT AND

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:37.221
IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY --

02:36:37.287 --> 02:36:40.524
BECAUSE I YOU KNOW --

02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:44.428

THAT SHOULDN'T SEPARATE US SO I

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:11.622
THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:13.257
PLACES WHERE WE CAN HAVE THOSE

02:37:13.323 --> 02:37:14.591

02:39:04.201 --> 02:39:05.736
THEM FOR CAPITAL BECAUSE OF THE

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:08.839
INVESTMENT BUT ALSO FOR CREATING

02:39:08.906 --> 02:39:10.941
THIS PIPELINE INTO INDUSTRIAL

02:39:11.008 --> 02:39:12.876
TRADE CAN HELP SUPPORT THE

02:39:12.943 --> 02:39:14.945
INNOVATION THE INNOVATION.

02:39:15.012 --> 02:39:17.180
IS NEEDS TO BE SCALED UP IN ITS

02:39:17.247 --> 02:39:18.916
THE SCALING UP OF THAT THAT

02:39:18.982 --> 02:39:21.618
PRODUCES THIS PRODUCTION THIS

02:39:21.685 --> 02:39:23.353
THIS NATION STATE MENTALITY ALL

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.588
GO BACK TO AGAIN.

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:26.590
THAT IF WE'RE JUST SEATING IDEAS

02:39:26.657 --> 02:39:28.558
IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT DOING

02:39:28.625 --> 02:39:30.294
ANYTHING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS

02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:31.995
INTO THE SCALING UP AND

02:39:32.062 --> 02:39:34.164
PRODUCTION MASS PRODUCTION OF

02:39:34.231 --> 02:39:35.732
THOSE IDEAS WERE GOING TO MISS

02:39:35.799 --> 02:39:37.167
OUT ON OPPORTUNITY.

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:38.101
I'D ALSO --

02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:39.603
SAY ONE LAST THING.

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.305
I NOTICE JUST HEARING FEEDBACK

02:39:41.371 --> 02:39:42.172
FROM MY COMPANIES THAT

02:39:42.239 --> 02:39:45.142
MILLENNIALS DON'T SEE WORK IN

02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:46.543
THE WORLD OF WORK LIKE WE NEED

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:48.345
TO ADD I'M EVEN ON THE EDGE OF

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:50.380
THAT MYSELF FOR I KNOW WHAT IT

02:39:50.447 --> 02:39:51.882
LOOKS LIKE BEFORE AND I'VE SEEN

02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:52.883
THE EVOLUTION.

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:54.685
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR NIMBLE

02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:56.186
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:39:56.253 --> 02:39:57.721
FLEXIBILITY THERE LOOKING FOR

02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:59.990
LOTS OF ON RAMPS AND OFF RAMPS

02:40:00.057 --> 02:40:02.392
BACK AND FORTH INTO CAREER AND

02:40:02.459 --> 02:40:03.760
INTO EDUCATION.

02:40:03.827 --> 02:40:05.796
SO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO

02:40:05.862 --> 02:40:07.931
EVOLVE WITH THE EXPECTATION OF

02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:09.032
THE MILLENNIALS AND THE

02:40:09.099 --> 02:40:10.600
GENERATION TO FOLLOW.

02:40:10.667 --> 02:40:13.570
AS TO WHAT THE GOAL OF A EASY IT

02:40:13.637 --> 02:40:16.940
IS ASSET AND IS NOT [inaudible]

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:21.044
BUT IT'S CREATING PATHWAYS SO

02:40:21.111 --> 02:40:23.146
INDIVIDUALS CAN SEE WELL HOW

02:40:23.213 --> 02:40:25.248
THOSE PATHWAYS CAN LEAD TO

02:40:25.315 --> 02:40:26.717
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES.

02:40:26.783 --> 02:40:27.985
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED

02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:32.155
IN STAYING SOMEWHERE. FOR TWENTY

02:40:32.222 --> 02:40:33.724
FIFTEEN NOT EVEN FIVE YEARS WE

02:40:33.790 --> 02:40:34.424
SEE THAT EVEN OUR OUR OWN

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.660
CAPITAL COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO

02:40:36.727 --> 02:40:38.328
MAKE SURE THAT OUR EDUCATION

02:40:38.395 --> 02:40:39.696
SYSTEM.

02:40:39.763 --> 02:40:41.898
EVOLVES AND AND FOR FEELS THAT

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:43.233
EXPECTATION.

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.768
RECORD JUST ADD SOMETHING TO

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:45.402
THAT.

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:48.305
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGY

02:40:48.372 --> 02:40:49.172
I HEAR A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS

02:40:49.239 --> 02:40:50.007
SAYING.

02:40:50.073 --> 02:40:51.241
INSTEAD OF WE'RE GOING TO GET

02:40:51.308 --> 02:40:53.276
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THEN WE'RE

02:40:53.343 --> 02:40:53.877
GOING TO TRAIN EVERYBODY TO DO

02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:54.644
IT.

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:55.946
THAT THEY'LL JUST GIVE THE TEAM

02:40:56.013 --> 02:40:57.848
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THEY'LL

02:40:57.914 --> 02:41:00.283
LET THE TEAM FIGURE OUT HOW BEST

02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:01.451
TO IMPLEMENT IT --

02:41:01.518 --> 02:41:03.620
THAT'S IT THAT'S A BIG CHANGE

02:41:03.687 --> 02:41:06.757
AND I THINK THE MORE WE CAN.

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:07.324
LEARN FROM THAT I THINK THE

02:41:07.391 --> 02:41:08.725
BETTER OFF WE'LL BE.

02:41:08.792 --> 02:41:10.160
WANTED OPEN UP --

02:41:10.227 --> 02:41:11.395
TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:13.530
LAST QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I I

02:41:13.597 --> 02:41:15.332
DO HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION BEFORE

02:41:15.399 --> 02:41:16.900
WE CLOSE --

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:18.902
WITH THIS SECTION HERE WHAT ARE

02:41:18.969 --> 02:41:20.904
THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THE

02:41:20.971 --> 02:41:23.306
STATE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT.

02:41:23.373 --> 02:41:28.645
UPWARD MOBILITY.

02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:28.812
SO.

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:30.514
I THINK.

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:33.583
THIS ISSUE OF A REGIONAL FOCUS --

02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:35.719
THE NATION STATE IF WE ARE THE

02:41:35.786 --> 02:41:37.921
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY --

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:40.023
IF WE WERE A COUNTRY WE ARE I

02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:41.691
MEAN THE UNITED STATES --

02:41:41.758 --> 02:41:43.727
IN THE DIFFERENT STATES OF THE

02:41:43.794 --> 02:41:45.228
UNITED STATES PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED

02:41:45.295 --> 02:41:46.663
ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE

02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:48.765
FOCUSED ON SECTOR BASS

02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:50.367
STRATEGIES --

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:51.935
WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT US AS

02:41:52.002 --> 02:41:53.970
THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND DO

02:41:54.037 --> 02:41:55.972
THE SAME DO THE SAME IN REGIONS

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.174
AS WE APPROACH.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.177
THESE ISSUES OF GROWTH OF

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:01.912
WORKFORCE TRAINING OF MAKING

02:42:01.978 --> 02:42:03.280
SURE THAT WE HIT OUR CLIMATE

02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:04.948
GOALS -- AND

02:42:05.015 --> 02:42:07.617
YET WE MAKE WE WE ARE PROTECTED

02:42:07.684 --> 02:42:09.953
IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.288
BUT I THINK THAT WOULD.

02:42:11.354 --> 02:42:12.789
RISE TO THE TOP OF MY LIST

02:42:12.856 --> 02:42:13.090
[inaudible]

02:42:13.156 --> 02:42:14.458
THANK YOU.

02:42:14.524 --> 02:42:15.659
A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO

02:42:15.725 --> 02:42:16.793
SAY ABOUT THAT --

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:19.329
FIRST AND FOREMOST --

02:42:19.396 --> 02:42:20.931
A LOT OF THIS IS BEEN FOCUSED ON

02:42:20.997 --> 02:42:22.799
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT TO ME

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:24.801
IS VERY KEY WE CANNOT ACHIEVE

02:42:24.868 --> 02:42:27.838
OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE CAN'T --

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:29.406
TO INNOVATES WE CAN'T --

02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:30.807
EXPAND OUR ECONOMY WITHOUT

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:32.309
MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE WORK

02:42:32.375 --> 02:42:33.977
FORCE THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS

02:42:34.044 --> 02:42:35.378
ARE GOING TO BE IN THE ECONOMY.

02:42:35.445 --> 02:42:38.615
SO TO THAT END MATE REALLY MAIN

02:42:38.682 --> 02:42:41.017
STREAMING CAREER TECHNICAL

02:42:41.084 --> 02:42:41.751
EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:43.920
DEVELOPMENT NOT SO THAT IT'S A

02:42:43.987 --> 02:42:45.522
ONE OFF FOR THAT AFTERTHOUGHT OR

02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:47.924
THE THING THAT WE FIND AFTER.

02:42:47.991 --> 02:42:49.426
IT TO REALLY BE AN INTEGRATED

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:52.496
PART OF AN EDUCATION EXPERIENCE

02:42:52.562 --> 02:42:55.232
WITH TRAINING FOR COLLEGE AND

02:42:55.298 --> 02:42:58.168
CAREER READINESS AGAIN THOSE ON

02:42:58.235 --> 02:42:59.803
RAMPS AND OFF RAMPS CREATING

02:42:59.870 --> 02:43:01.638
OPTIONS AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:04.207
SIMPLY MEMBER. FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:43:04.274 --> 02:43:06.610
SO THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW INFO

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:08.578
AT THAT WILL INFORM THEIR CAREER

02:43:08.645 --> 02:43:09.479
PATH.

02:43:09.546 --> 02:43:11.681
IN THEIR EDUCATION EXPERIENCE

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:14.050
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE --

02:43:14.117 --> 02:43:15.952
THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE YOU KNOW

02:43:16.019 --> 02:43:16.486
KIND OF CHANGING THAT THE

02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:18.488
EDUCATION SYSTEM THE DELIVERY OF

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:20.724
THE SYSTEM AND ALSO THE FUNDING

02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:23.326
MECHANISMS ALSO WE CAN'T HAVE

02:43:23.393 --> 02:43:25.562
INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE TEACHERS.

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:27.497
SO WE NEED TO BUILD OUR WORK

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:29.099
FORCE OF TEACHERS THEY NEED TO

02:43:29.166 --> 02:43:30.200
BE EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY IN

02:43:30.267 --> 02:43:32.302
ACADEMICS BUT ALSO HAVE

02:43:32.369 --> 02:43:34.037
EXPERIENCE IN INDUSTRY IF YOU'RE

02:43:34.104 --> 02:43:35.472
GOING TO GET HIGH QUALITY

02:43:35.539 --> 02:43:36.940
RELEVANT PROGRAMS.

02:43:37.007 --> 02:43:38.074
SO THE PHILS THAT THEY'RE

02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:39.843
CONCENTRATED AND THEY NEED TO

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:41.478
HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AND ALSO

02:43:41.545 --> 02:43:42.946
SOME SUPPORT FROM THEIR

02:43:43.013 --> 02:43:44.514
STATEWIDE PARTNERS AS WELL.

02:43:44.581 --> 02:43:49.886
WE NEED TO DEVELOP IT WAS BUT BE

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:51.087
ON THE TRADITIONAL

02:43:51.154 --> 02:43:52.789
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH IN

02:43:52.856 --> 02:43:55.158
OUR INDUSTRY WORKS BETTER FOR

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:56.860
OUR LARGER MANUFACTURERS NOT SO

02:43:56.927 --> 02:43:58.495
MUCH FOR OUR SMALL ONES FOR WHAT

02:43:58.562 --> 02:44:00.096
I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.

02:44:00.163 --> 02:44:00.897
THEY DON'T HAVE THE WHOLE

02:44:00.964 --> 02:44:03.033
INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOUNDATION TO

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:04.801
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE HOURS

02:44:04.868 --> 02:44:06.736
THAT NEED TO BE RECORDED THAT

02:44:06.803 --> 02:44:08.238
YOU KNOW THAT TRAINING AND

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.839
HAVING SOMEBODY BE GONE OUT OF

02:44:09.906 --> 02:44:11.341
THE OPERATION FOR CERTAIN

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:12.442
AMOUNTS OF TIMES DURING THE

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:13.843
PRODUCTION SCHEDULE.

02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:15.178
SO WE NEED TO HAVE EARNING LEARN

02:44:15.245 --> 02:44:17.080
PROGRAMS THAT CAN WORK FOR ALL

02:44:17.147 --> 02:44:18.882
INDUSTRIES.

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:20.550
AND FINALLY.

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.052
AGAIN I MENTIONED THIS BEFORE IF

02:44:22.118 --> 02:44:24.821
WE WANT PEOPLE TO SUCCEED AND TO

02:44:24.888 --> 02:44:26.456
HAVE SUSTAINABLE CAREERS WITH

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:28.258
LIVABLE WAGES CALIFORNIA MUST

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:30.160
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:32.495
COLLEGE A AND CAREER.

02:44:32.562 --> 02:44:35.098
THE GOAL OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:37.734
SHOULD NOT BE A COLLEGE DEGREE

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:39.736
IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL AND

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:41.304
FULFILLING AND SUSTAINABLE

02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:43.473
CAREER AND NOT WILL ENSURE THAT

02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:45.108
INDIVIDUALS HAVE OPTIONS THEY

02:44:45.175 --> 02:44:47.244
CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATHWAYS.

02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:48.578
AND THEY WILL REALLY FEEL

02:44:48.645 --> 02:44:51.781
EMPOWERED AND BE ABLE --

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:54.084
TO ENGAGE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE

02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:56.019
ECONOMY ECONOMY IN A MEANINGFUL

02:44:56.086 --> 02:45:00.357
WAY -- I'D

02:45:00.423 --> 02:45:02.759
LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE THE ASPECT

02:45:02.826 --> 02:45:04.427
OF EDUCATION.

02:45:04.494 --> 02:45:08.231
AND COLLEGE RUSSES.

02:45:08.298 --> 02:45:09.899
APPRENTICESHIP AND THAT THAT

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:11.067
TAPE WITH ME IT'S REALLY

02:45:11.134 --> 02:45:13.136
IMPORTANT.

02:45:13.203 --> 02:45:15.305
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A INTERNAL

02:45:15.372 --> 02:45:17.407
BATTLE WITHIN THE DIFFERENT

02:45:17.474 --> 02:45:18.908
SECTORS.

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:21.511
OF THE COMMUNITY OF THESE PEOPLE

02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:23.146
I KNOW I WAS INVOLVED.

02:45:23.213 --> 02:45:25.081
IN AND I EVEN FORGET WHAT THE

02:45:25.148 --> 02:45:26.516
ORGANIZATION WAS BUT I HAD THE

02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:29.185
GUY CALLED ME UP AND HE SAID THE

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:29.753
GUY WHO WAS THE HEAD OF THE

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:31.554
COMMUNITY.

02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:32.922
AND HE SAID SO.

02:45:32.989 --> 02:45:34.624
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE THE

02:45:34.691 --> 02:45:36.960
FOCUS OF EDUCATION?

02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:40.630
AND HIS BAND WAS COLLEGE.

02:45:40.697 --> 02:45:42.198
AND DO IS AN INTERNAL BATTLE

02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:45.268
GOING ON THAT'S GOT TO STOP --

02:45:45.335 --> 02:45:47.137
THERE'S A PLACE FOR BOTH.

02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:49.606
MEDICS IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:51.608
EMPHASIZE THAT THERE'S A ROLE

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:53.143
FOR COLLEGE THERE'S A ROLE FOR

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:55.812
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIR

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.047
TO ROSE FOR FRIENDSHIPS.

02:45:57.113 --> 02:46:01.551
AND THOSE THOSE ALL NEED TO BE.
