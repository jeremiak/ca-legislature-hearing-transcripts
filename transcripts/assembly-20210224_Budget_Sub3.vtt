LEADING UP TO THIS- UP TO THIS

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.923

AGREES AS SUCH IS NOT

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.347
APPROPRIATE AND IT'S GOING TO

00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:12.983

BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING AND

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:50.867
IT'S BEEN A TURN OVER THE YEARS

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.802

PROPOSAL. COBIT NINETEEN AND

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.689
OTHER CHALLENGES TOWARD OUR

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:13.323
CHANCE FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.492
LAST YEAR. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:18.061

PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO ANSWER

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:24.100
THREE QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:25.835
WHAT PROGRAM SHOULD DGSE BE

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:28.204

FEES. AND REVENUES SUPPORT

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:33.510
THOSE SERVICES WHILE THEY

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.512
DISSENTED DISINCENTIVE BUYS THE

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.380
USE OF MISMANAGEMENT OF

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:40.917
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. ALSO

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:43.320
THIRDLY WHAT GOVERNANCE

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:45.822
STRUCTURE BEST SUPPORTS THAT

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.792
THE BEST FOSTERS TRANSPARENCY

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:51.828
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROVIDE

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.997
STRONGER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.732
THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.801
TO LAST YEAR'S IT ESTABLISHES A

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:59.202
BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.371
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY FORTY TO

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:03.740
SET FEES BASED ON APPROPRIATION

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:05.542
BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND LIKE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.344
LAST YEAR THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.979
AN OMBUDSPERSON WHO REPORTS TO

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:11.915
THE BOARD. IT HAS BEEN IT HAS A

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.984
SIMPLIFIED IT UP TO BE UPDATED

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.252
FEES FOR BOTH OF THE GSES

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.587
ACCOUNTS WITH THE COMPUTERS.

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:21.791
COACH BUT THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:23.493
HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT ALL

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.161
THAT WE LEARNED LAST YEAR

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.229
PARTICULARLY THROUGH OUR

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:27.831
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:30.000
ON EIGHTY NINE NINE FIVE. WE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:32.836
URGE. WE HEARD CALLS FOR

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:33.903
STRONGER ACCOUNTABILITY

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:36.272
MEASURES A NUMBER FOR. WE HEARD

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.041
CALLS TO HEED THE LESSONS WE

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.676
LEARNED IN THE WAKE OF THE

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:42.145
EXITE BANKRUPTCY. AND WE HEARD

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.247
THAT THE STATUS QUO SERVICE

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.616
LEVELS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO DO

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:49.252
WHAT'S EXPECTED OF US. SO IN

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.787
RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS THIS

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:52.055
YEAR'S PROPOSAL HAS SOME

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:54.057
IMPORTANT CHANGES. THOSE

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.492
DETAILS WERE PROVIDED IN

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.826
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELEASED

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:59.462
JUST YESTERDAY. THE LANGUAGE

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:01.131
UPDATES THE FEE STRUCTURES

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:02.365
WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN MODIFIED

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:04.167
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BUT

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.669
DOES SO WITH AN APPROACH THAT'S

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:08.271
MINDFUL OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.140
TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND BEEN

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:13.076
HIT HARD BY THE PANDEMIC. THE

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.277
BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDES

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:15.512
ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:17.213
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES BY

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.448
SETTING PERMITTING DECISION

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:21.217
TIMELINE TO BE REPORTED ON TO

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:22.218
THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:25.055
SAFETY. IN A HAS STRONGER

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.790
FINANCIAL ASSURANCE PROVISIONS.

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.858
IMPORTANTLY THE PROPOSED FEE

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.627
INCREASES WOULD COVER NOT JUST

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:33.430
THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:33.963
INCREASE CERTAIN LEVELS OF

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:36.499
SERVICE. ADDITIONAL REVENUE

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.600
WOULD ALLOW US TO START

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.569
INVESTIGATING THE ESTIMATED

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:43.473
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.074
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:44.674
CONTAMINATED SITES AROUND THE

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:46.242
STATE. WOULD ALLOW US TO DO

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:48.078
MORE INSPECTIONS AND TAKE

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:50.580
ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST MORE

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.816
HAZARDOUS WASTE VIOLATORS IN

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:55.118
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND IT

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.619
WOULD FUND A MODERNIZED

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.354
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:01.357
FOR THE STATE. HOW ARE

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.892
ESTIMATES FOR THE WE NEED THE

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.527
RESOURCES ARE BASED ON THE

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.062
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WE RELEASED

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:08.198
IN JANUARY. THAT WORKLOAD

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:10.400
ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN IN

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.202
RESPONSE TO LEGISLATIVE AND

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:13.770
STAKEHOLDER REQUESTS FOR MORE

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.905
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING OUR

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.841
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE

00:56:17.907 --> 00:56:18.942
FINDINGS OF THE WORKLOAD

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.211
ANALYSIS SHOW WHAT DGSE CAN

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:23.079
ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE WHEN GIVEN

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.881
THE RIGHT RESOURCES. IT

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.649
PROVIDES THE LONG REQUESTED

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.284
TRANSPARENCY INTO HOW WE'RE

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.086
USING OUR RESOURCES BASED ON A

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.489
SNAPSHOT AT A PARTICULAR POINT

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:35.291
IN TIME. MIND YOU IT DOES NOT

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:37.527
HAVE THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.996
SPECIFIC BUDGETARY REQUESTS NOR

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:42.098
IS IT A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:44.601
OF RESOURCES NEEDED FOR EVERY

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.903
DGSE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. BUT

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.772
THE DEEP BUT THE ANALYSIS DOES

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.340
SHOW THE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:52.342
EACH YES HE'S RESPONSIBILITIES

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.344
AND ITS RESOURCES. THAT MEANS

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.312
WERE UNABLE TO FULFILL CURRENT

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:58.615
MANDATES FOR TAKE ON ANY NEW

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:02.118
ACTIVITIES. YOU KNOW THIS IS

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:04.087
DOCUMENTS EXAMPLES OF SERVICES

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.889
DGSE COULD DELIVER WITH

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:07.957
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WE'VE

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.826
ESTIMATED THE RESOURCES NEEDED

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.628
TO CLOSE GAPS FOR WHAT WE JUDGE

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:12.996
TO BE SOME OF THE HIGHEST

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.632
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES IN ORDER

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:16.866
TO ANSWER THAT FIRST QUESTION

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:19.836
OF THE REFORM WHAT SERVICES

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:22.238
SHOULD DGSE WEBER. WE THINK

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:23.773
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE ON MORE

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.142
ENFORCEMENT IN AREAS KNOWN TO

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:28.278
HAVE A HIGH RATE OF VIOLATION.

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.814
HAZARDOUS WASTE TRANSPORTATION

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.483
JEWELRY CONTAINING METAL HEAVY

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.218
METALS THAT SOLD TO CHILDREN.

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:36.786
WE MUST HAVE RESOURCES TO

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.888
MAINTAIN OUR FEDERAL DELEGATION

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:41.291
OF OUR REQUIRE AFFORD. WE LACK

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.892
RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.828
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL FOUR

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.229
STEPS OF THE SAFER CONSUMER

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.664
PRODUCTS GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.700
REGULATION. AND WE'VE USED OUR

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:52.235
EXPERIENCE FROM THE FIRST TWO

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.636
YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING THE

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:56.005
VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURE TO

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:58.041
ESTIMATE WHAT'S NEEDED FOR BSP

00:57:58.107 --> 00:58:01.477
MOVING FORWARD. THESE ESTIMATES

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:02.979
SUPPORT DECISIONS ABOUT THE

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.247
SECOND OF THE THREE QUESTIONS

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.715
RAISED EARLIER WHAT FEES AND

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.551
REVENUES ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:11.054
THE DESIRED SERVICE LEVELS. THE

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.422
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS MAKES IT

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.390
CLEAR THAT DGSE IS HAS THE

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.292
BALL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:18.528
PERFORMANCE DRIVEN CULTURE WE

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.463
NOW RETOOL ESTABLISH CLEAR

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.498
METRICS ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS SO

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:27.770
THAT WE CAN TRACK PROGRESS. THE

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.439
AVERAGE TIME NEEDED TO ISSUE A

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:30.907
PERMIT DECISION IS NOT TWO

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:33.176
POINT FIVE YEARS THAT'S DOWN

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.346
FROM FOUR POINT FIVE YEARS. IN

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:37.814
TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WE ONLY

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.515
ISSUED ONE PERMIT DECISION. WE

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:40.917
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:43.686
TAKES TO REFER ENFORCEMENT

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:47.790
ACTIONS BY 43% BOTH USEPA JAM

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.092
THE PARCHMENT OF DEFENSE HAVE

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.727
LAUDED ARE IMPROVEMENTS ON

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.695
MANAGING RECORD CLEAN UP SITES

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.097
AND MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.932
INDICATOR TARGETS FOR THOSE

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.533
CLEAN UP. WE'RE DOING WELL WITH

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.835
WHAT WE HAVE AT BUT IT'S NOT

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:02.205
ENOUGH. THE IMPROVE THE DGSE

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:04.140
MUST BE COMPLEMENTED BY THE

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.775
RIGHT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:08.478
THE RIGHT RESOURCES FOR FORMING

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:10.313
THE TNC CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.915
WE KNOW THAT THE FACILITIES

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:15.585
THAT HANDLE TOXIC MATERIALS ARE

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:16.653
LOCATED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:20.189
WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING NOT ONLY.

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.925
EXCESS ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:22.525
BUT HAVE SUFFERED

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.661
DISPROPORTIONATELY DURING THE

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.362
CALL THE PANDEMIC. THE

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.197
CONTAMINATED SITES THAT NEED TO

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.866
BE CLEANED UP ARE LOCATED IN

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:32.368
THE SAME COMMUNITY. IT'S URGENT

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.003
THAT WE BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.139
AND CLEAN UP THE SITES AT THE

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.941
SAME TIME WE HAVE AN

00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:39.976
OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT EACH

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:42.412
YEAR SEES WORK CONTRIBUTES TO

RECOVERY. CREATING JOBS THROUGH

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:53.690
CLEANUPS PUTTING WE BACK INTO

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:55.959
FOR PRODUCTIVE USE AND CREATING

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:58.528
CLIMATE FRIENDLY AFFORDABLE

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.763
HOUSING IN THE PROCESS. LIKE IT

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.665
OR NOT OUR LIFESTYLES REQUIRE

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:05.368
MANY TOXIC CHEMICALS UNTIL THAT

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.703
CHANGES WE MUST TAKE

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.471
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARMFUL

WITH THOSE FOLKS. CAN YOU

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:13.374
ARTICULATE FOR ME WHAT WHAT

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:14.675
SOME OF THOSE UNINTENDED

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.410
CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE THAT THE

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:20.448
OPPONENTS ARE. SUGGESTING HERE-

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.016
I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S IN A

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.918
NOBLE EFFORT- THE QUESTION IS

01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:24.886
YOU KNOW HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:25.920
IN THE REAL WORLD DO WE

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.955
ACTUALLY GET THE- THE NET

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:29.690
RESULT AND THE APPROPRIATE

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:31.759
USAGE OF THE RIGHT KINDS OF

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:34.762
THESE- OF THESE PESTICIDES-

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.130
WHAT WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:39.534
CONVERSATION- RIGHT NOW WITH

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.369
SOME OF THE OPPONENTS. WELL

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:42.270
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISTER

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:43.905
MOLD YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:46.574
THAT NEED ON MY TEAM AND OUR

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:48.576
COLLEAGUES AT CDFA A PATH. THE

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.344
LAST NUMBER OF WEEKS WITH FOLKS

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.380
WHO. HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.515
PROPOSAL ARE YOU KNOW. ABOUT

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:56.617
THE DETAILS AND WHAT THE SIGNAL

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:58.286
WORDS REALLY NEED THEM. YOU

01:30:58.352 --> 01:30:59.987
KNOW WHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:02.557
RAISED IN THE DIFFERENT

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:03.124
CATEGORIES JUST TO PROVIDE A

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:05.059
LITTLE. INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNAL

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:08.162
WORDS THE SIGNAL WORD APPROACH.

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:10.331
WE DEVELOPED WAS USED BECAUSE

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:13.000
WE FELT THAT MOST RATE BUT MOST

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:15.102
REGISTRANTS AND MIL PLAYERS HAD

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:17.338
SOME FAMILIARITY WITH U. S.

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.841
EPA'S METHOD OF DEVELOPING

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.142
SIGNAL WORK SO WE HAVE NONE AND

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:23.311
CAUTION ON THE LESS TOXIC END

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:25.046
OF THE SPECTRUM WARNING IN THE

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:26.714
MIDDLE AND DANGEROUS

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.249
FLASHPOINTS AND ON THE FAR END.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.517
AND WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.786
A GOOD SOLID EASILY UNDERSTOOD

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:34.155
WAY OF DEVELOPING THIS NEW

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:37.191
TIERED MECHANISM ABOUT 63% OF

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:38.860
THE SALES IN CALIFORNIA FALL

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.962
UNDER THAT NON SLASH CAUTION

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.730
AND AGAIN THAT'S WHERE THE

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:44.365
SMALLEST IMPACT WILL BE IN

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.367
TERMS OF- IMPACTS ON

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.135
REGISTRANTS. I WOULD ALSO ADD

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:49.871
THAT FOR NON SLASH CAUTION

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.172
WE'RE DEFERRING THE MILL

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.573
INCREASE FOUR YEAR BECAUSE

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.609
THERE ARE MANY COVERT NINETEEN

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:56.344
RELATED PRODUCTS THAT FALL

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.812
UNDER THAT CATEGORY IN THE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:58.946
DEPARTMENT HAS REALLY BEEN GOOD

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.915
ABOUT EXPEDITING THE

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.717
REGISTRATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.552
AND GETTING THEM TO MARKET FOR

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.520
INSTITUTIONAL GIVES. ABOUT

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:08.789
MIDDLE CATEGORIES ABOUT 14% BY

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:10.458
SALES AND THE DANGER SLASH

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:14.195
POISON IS 23% SO YOU KNOW MY

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.763
CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD-

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:16.931
BEGINNING THE DAY THAT THE

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.799
BUDGET WAS ANNOUNCED AND MANY

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.601
SUBSEQUENT MEETING SINE THEN

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.069
WILL BE TO HEAR OUT THE

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.471
CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.506
OPPOSED TO THE IDEA. TRYING TO

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:27.241
ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE I CAN

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:29.243
SEE IF THEIR SUGGESTIONS FOR

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:30.244
YOU KNOW THINGS THAT MIGHT

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.580
TWEAK OUT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:33.180
THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT A MORE

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:34.448
EFFECTIVE ONE. AND TO

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:38.920
INCORPORATE. THAT INTO OUR

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:40.554
THINKING GOING FORWARD.

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:41.289
BRIGITTE ANSWERED THANK YOU.

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:44.525
WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF.

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:46.694
OVER I CERTAINLY THE

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:49.497
DEPARTMENTS- CONCEPT HERE AND

01:32:49.563 --> 01:32:51.699
THE GOVERNOR'S- SUPPORT FOR

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.935
THIS THE IDEA OF MOVING TO

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:56.270
TIERED STRUCTURES MAKES SIMPLE

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:58.973
COMMONSENSE WHAT I WOULD LIKE

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.643
TO. ADD IS SEE IF WE COULD

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.145
FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:06.180
ON THE ISSUE OF SUSTAINABILITY

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.783
OF THE FEES I THINK NO MATTER

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:11.852
WHERE WE ALL ARE- POLITICALLY

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.454
ALMOST EVERYBODY WOULD SAY IT

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:15.256
MAKES COMMON SENSE NOT TO RUN

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:17.124
DEFICITS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:18.326
THINK SAID GOVERNMENT SHOULD

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:20.461
RUN DEFICITS OVERALL AND IF YOU

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:22.163
SHOULD RUN DEFICITS OVERALL YOU

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.497
SHOULD RUN DEFICITS IN

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:24.932
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE WHEN THE

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.001
DEPARTMENT RUNS A DEFICIT. AND

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.703
THEN HAS TO TRY TO BORROW FROM

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.204
SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT OF MOTHER

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.807
FUND X. CENTER IN THE SECOND

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.508
CONCEPT THAT I THINK ALMOST

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.410
EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IS THAT

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.312
IF YOU ACCURATELY PRICED

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:41.983
SOMETHING FOR ITS OVERALL COST

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.251
YOU USE THAT PRODUCT MORE

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:46.954
EFFICIENTLY SO IF YOU ARE ABLE

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.255
TO JUST DUMP A BUNCH OF

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:50.424
EXTERNAL COST OFFER THE SORT OF

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:51.859
THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS THAT

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.494
WE'VE SEEN SO MANY TIMES.

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:55.096
PEOPLE USE MORE OF SOMETHING

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.297
BUT IF THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.866
PAY THE TRUE COST SO- IF YOU

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.801
COMBINE THAT WITH SOME PEOPLE

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:03.337
BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM THE

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:06.107
USE OF THE PESTICIDES THEY GET

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:08.042
TO GROW MORE CROPS MAKE MORE

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.077
PROFITS NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.479
THAT'S A BAD THING AT ALL AND

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.714
I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT'S BAD FOR

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.782
CONSUMERS CONSUMERS BENEFIT

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:16.784
ALSO BECAUSE THEY GET MORE FOOD

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:20.955
AT EXETER. BUT IF WE ACCURATELY

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:23.924
PRICE. THE TWO COST OF THE

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:26.060
PRODUCTION OF THAT PRODUCT WE

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.195
GET A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION

01:34:28.262 --> 01:34:33.601
OF THAT. AND SO- I'M NOT- THE-

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:35.569
OVERALL REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.638
A FOUR YEAR PHASE IN BECAUSE IT

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:40.007
ALLOWS THE DEFICIT TO RUN UNTIL

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:42.043
THAT FOURTH YEAR. BUT I'M

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:44.612
WILLING TO SUPPORT THE FOUR

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:46.313
YEAR PHASE IN BECAUSE I REALIZE

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.616
POLITICALLY IT IT HELPS PEOPLE

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:50.684
MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. BUT WHAT I

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.586
AM CONCERNED WITH IS WHEN WE

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:55.389
FINISH THAT FOURTH YEAR- WE

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.924
WILL GO BACK TO WHAT

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:57.425
TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:58.893
HAPPENING WITH THIS DEPARTMENT.

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:01.128
THE LAST TIME THIS BILL FEE WAS

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.129
INCREASED WAS TWO THOUSAND AND

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:04.498
FOUR. NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT THE

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:06.901
COST OF RUNNING THE PROGRAMS

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:10.304
THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT. AND

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.606
MONITORING EXETER GRADUALLY

01:35:12.673 --> 01:35:14.175
WENT UP AND UP AND UP AND THE

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.943
DEPARTMENT RAN A BIGGER BIGGER

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.144
DEFICIT IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:19.880
PROGRAM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:21.982
GOOD GOVERNMENT PRINCIPLES AND

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.617
COMMON SENSE WHILE WE MAY SAY

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.586
POLITICALLY WE PHASE IT IN. WE

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:28.222
SHOULDN'T STOP THAT AT THE FOUR

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:32.726
YEAR MARK. I THINK WE SHOULD.

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:33.994
BUILD IN SOME KIND OF. ALL OF

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:36.063
LIVING A JUST. AND I THINK WE

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.364
CAN BE CREATIVE ABOUT THAT IT

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.066
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY THE

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:40.668
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX EVERY YEAR

01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:42.236
WHICH WOULD CAUSE SOME WEIRD

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.538
YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES BUT- MAYBE

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:45.940
YOU DO IT EVERY TWO YEARS MAYBE

01:35:46.006 --> 01:35:48.142
YOU. BUT THAT THAT SHOULD BE A

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:50.411
PRINCIPLE THAT I THINK MOST OF

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:53.447
US COULD AGREE UPON BECAUSE- IT

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.516
IS IT JUST MAKES COMMON SENSE

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:56.750
IT WOULD KEEP THE DEPARTMENT

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.018
FOR RUNNING A DEFICIT MORE

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.354
CLOSELY MATCH REVENUES. TO

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.623
EXPENDITURES AND IT WOULD ALSO

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.825
GIVE US A CHANCE TO MORE

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:08.195
CLOSELY MATCH THE IMPACTS- AND

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.363
THEREFORE THE THAT THE COST OF

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.232
APPLICATION. SO I'VE HEARD THE

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:13.434
ISSUE RAISED. WHAT ARE WE GOING

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.202
TO DO WITH THE REVENUES ARE NOT

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:18.539
ENOUGH- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:21.041
INCREASED. COST WILL CAUSE A

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.576
REDUCTION IN THE USE OF THE

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:24.745
PESTICIDE. AND I WOULD OFFER TO

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.614
YOU. THAT'S A GREAT THING TO

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.150
HAPPEN. BECAUSE IF YOU DECREASE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:31.285
THE AMOUNT OF PESTICIDE USE YOU

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.020
HOPEFULLY HAVE FEWER NEGATIVE

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.555
IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:36.190
YOU SHOULD HAVE LESS

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:37.791
ENFORCEMENT. BEING NEEDED

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:40.461
XCERRA SO I WOULD ASK THE

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:43.364
DEPARTMENT TO- STRONGLY

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.933
CONSIDER SOME KIND OF COST OF

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.269
LIVING INDEX IF WE'RE GOING TO.

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.070
GO THROUGH THE CHALLENGE OF A

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:53.874
TIERED RATE INCREASE FOR- AND

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:55.643
WE'RE GOING TO PHASE IT IN THEN

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:57.144
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THIS IS

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.445
THE PERFECT TIME TO TALK ABOUT

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:01.048
PHASING IN- OR THE FOR THE

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:02.449
PHASE IN CONTINUING WITH SOME

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:03.284
KIND OF COST OF LIVING

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:05.719
INCREASE. THAT WOULD BE OVERALL

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:09.523
GOOD GOVERNMENT FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:10.124
IF WE COULD DO THAT THANK YOU

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:12.259
VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR AND WE

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:13.561
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.696
CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND THE

01:37:15.763 --> 01:37:16.530
LEGISLATURE I WOULD JUST ADD

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:18.465
THAT TO. THE IMBALANCES

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:20.267
ADDRESSED IN YEAR ONE ACCORDING

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.669
TO OUR PROJECTIONS YEARS

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:22.670

UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IS

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.323
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT AT LARGE

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:25.432
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

SHORT TERM COST THE BUYERS AND

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:41.882
SELLERS OF PESTICIDES- IT WOULD

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:43.617
HAVE SOME NOTABLE DRAWBACKS IT

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:45.219
POTENTIALLY CREATES A WEAKER

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.420
MARKET SIGNAL FROM THE START

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:49.456
SINCE THE- EIGHTH IT'LL BE.

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.758
SLOWER AND THEN USING A SLOWER

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.393
AND GENERATES. REVENUES UP

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:54.061
FRONT WHICH REQUIRES GENERAL

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.864

AS SEEN IN A PROPOSAL. AN

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.768
ANALYSIS WE PROVIDE- THE

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.403
LEGISLATURE WITH ALTERNATIVE

PHASE IN A TWO YEAR PHASE AND

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:11.245
WE THINK THAT- THAT ALIGNS.

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:12.813
REVENUES WITH SPENDING AND ALSO

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:17.985
THAT THE LEGISLATURE LINE AND A

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.486
NEW SPENDING WITH THE RATE AT

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:21.288
WHICH REVENUES ARE GENERATED.

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.423
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAVE

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.625
NO REVENUES- TO FULLY FUND

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.293
PROPOSED SPENDING. A MINUTE

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.528
GENERAL FUND COSTS AND

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:30.264
POTENTIALLY PROVIDE MORE

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:30.831
IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE DPR

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.533
FIND- WE ALSO PROVIDE THE

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.835
LEGISLATURE WITH TO- GREATER

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:37.171
POLICY QUESTIONS FIRST IS- THE

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:39.006
NOTION OF SIGNAL WORD- GET

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:40.874
MINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING TO

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:41.975
BASE ITS YOUR TAX ON SIGNAL

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.577
WORD. WHICH INDICATES A

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:46.347
PRODUCTS- ACUTE TOXICITY LEVEL.

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:47.581
AND SPEAKING WITH EXPERTS IN

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.216
THE FIELD ACUTE TOXICITY

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:50.751
DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.886
WITH. CHRONIC TOXICITY OR A

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.888
LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:56.457
SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:58.292
CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES THAT

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:00.961
ADDRESS A BROADER BROADER RANGE

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.329
OF PESTICIDE RELATED CONCERNS.

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:04.732
AND WHETHER- RATE SHOULD

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.367
REFLECT REVENUE TARGETS ARE

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:08.035
MARK NICK PARK MARKET SIGNAL-

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.570
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RATES

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:11.472
WOULD FULLY FUND THE PROPOSED

SPENDING ONCE FULLY

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:13.574
IMPLEMENTED. ON A DRESS THE

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.642
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- HOWEVER

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:17.611
UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:18.812
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGHEST

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.848
AND LOWEST TIER WILL BE ROUGHLY

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.850
2% IN TERMS OF PRICE. AND WE

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.385
FIND THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:26.453
SMALL PRICE DIFFERENCE SO IT

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.855
WOULDN'T HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:29.923
THE- THE MIX OF PESTICIDES USED

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:31.358
IN THE STATE. SO THE

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:33.594
LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER- A

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.194
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE THAN

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:36.029
BEING PROPOSED. I'M HAPPY TO

THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:04.992
ROUTE TO REALLY REFLECT THAT

01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:06.193
THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS IN TERMS

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.695
OF TOXICITY- THE SAME THING

POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE USES. AND

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:31.331
NOT JUST ALSO UNDERSCORES THE

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.366
FACT THAT THERE IS NO STATUS

QUO THESE DAYS AND THAT WE ARE

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:36.836
LOOKING FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES

OF THE SITUATIONS THAT I

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:40.707
ENCOUNTERED. I'M AS I MENTIONED

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.242
BEFORE THE PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE

IS PART OF THAT. THESE ARE ALL

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:53.920
VERY AGING STATE ASSETS AND-

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:55.755
RECENT SURVEYS THAT SHOWN THAT

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:58.191
THERE'S PROBABLY. ALMOST TWO

01:54:58.258 --> 01:54:59.192
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.226
OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:02.095
COULD BE DONE IF THOSE UNDS

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.763
WERE AVAILABLE SO AT TEN

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:05.331
MILLION IS JUST SMALL START

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.633
TOWARDS THAT IN THAT DIRECTION

01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:12.939
TO DO THAT. AND WITHOUT. ALL BE

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:13.573

WHEN I HAVE A FAIR GROUND IS

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:22.782
USED- BY THE STATE- IF FOR

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:25.485
EXAMPLE WHEN- CAL FIVE SETS UP

01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:27.587
A INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER IS

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:32.258

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:35.828
TO THE TO THE FAIR OR IS THAT.

01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:38.564
JUST MADE AVAILABLE AND TO

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:42.502
OTHERS NO TRANSFER OF FUNDS.

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:43.803
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:45.204
ACTUALLY IS A MORE COMPLICATED

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.006
QUESTION THAN YOU PROBABLY

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:49.842
THINK ON THE SURFACE. THERE

01:55:49.909 --> 01:55:51.744
SOME THINGS DEPENDING ON THE

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:54.280
USE THERE IS NOT A COST

01:55:54.347 --> 01:55:56.749
RECOVERY OPPORTUNITY- BUT WHEN

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.251
THE MONEY COMES IN AND OUT

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.019
PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:01.688
HIM AREIMBURSEMENT. AND THEN

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:03.890
ALSO IN CERTAIN INSTANCES OTHER

01:56:03.956 --> 01:56:05.525
MONEY COMES IN FROM NONPROFITS

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:07.427
LIKE THE RED CROSS TO PROVIDE

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:08.828
SHELTER AND SERVICES MY PEOPLE

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:11.064
ARE DISPLACED. AND SO THE

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:12.699
ANSWER IS THAT YES THERE IS

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:15.101
SOME COST RECOVERY- BUT IT'S

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.402
NOT AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS YOU

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:18.338
MIGHT THINK IT IS AND THERE ARE

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.706
WE DO END UP WITH COSTS THAT

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:21.240
ARE NOT ABLE TO BE RECOVERED

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:23.276
DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS I SEE

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:29.349
OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:56:29.415 --> 01:56:30.550

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:40.093
ON THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR

STATE AFFILIATED FARES UNTIL

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:43.830
THE MAY REVISION. I ALWAYS FIND

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:44.797
THAT PROVIDING OPERATIONAL

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.032
SUPPORTERS REASONABLE SINCE

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:47.300
FARES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:49.102
CONDUCT THEIR NORMAL REVENUE

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:51.204
GENERATING ACTIVITIES. OVER THE

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:53.406
ASSUMES THAT PAIRS WILL BE

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:55.108
UNABLE TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:57.076
THE BUDGET YEAR- WE FOUND THAT

01:56:57.143 --> 01:56:57.944
THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.278
REGARDING THIS GIVEN THAT

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:00.847
SOCIAL. DISTANCING GUIDELINES

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:03.015
MIGHT BE UPDATED AS MORE PEOPLE

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.751
ARE VACCINATED. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:57:04.817 --> 01:57:05.918
DELAYING A DECISION ON THIS

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:07.520
ITEM BUT ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:07.587 --> 01:57:08.788

QUARTERLY BASIS. I RECOMMEND

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:27.940
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:29.842

THESE FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO BE.

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.490
ADJUSTED METHODOLOGIES ARE

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:45.558
LIKELY TO BE ADJUSTED AS WELL

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:48.060
AS MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

01:57:48.127 --> 01:57:49.996
IS MADE AVAILABLE ON THE FARES-

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.164

EXPECTED BEING THAT HAPPENED

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.383
BUT WE DO NEED TO ACT QUICKLY.

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:18.918
AND PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE FAIR

01:59:18.985 --> 01:59:20.553
AND SO GIVEN THAT THEY ARE

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.321
WORKING ON ON TIGHT BUDGETS.

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:23.823
ARE THERE THERE IS SOME CONCERN

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.659
THERE ON- CAN REDUCING THAT

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:31.197
FLEXIBILITY. SO WHEN IT COMES

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:35.301
TO THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:36.769
PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:40.673
THOSE- SHOVEL READY TO THE

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.408
EXTENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:44.677
THAT'S REQUESTED. THE QUESTION

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:49.081
MAKE SENSE. MISTER CHAIR I CAN

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:51.250
HANDLE THAT QUESTION AND YET AS

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:52.985
I INDICATED BEFORE WHEN YOU

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:54.186
LOOK AT THE RELATIVE PROPORTION

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:55.988
OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:58.124
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:59:58.190 --> 01:59:59.225
DOLLARS AND IDENTIFY NEEDS OUT

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:01.894
THERE- THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER

02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:04.297
OF SHOVEL READY PROD PROJECTS

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:04.864
THAT WE COULD PUT THE MONEY

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:06.832
TOWARDS VERY QUICKLY- BUT I

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:07.767
DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE ILLUSION

02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:09.602
THAT IT'S EASY TO DO THERE'S

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:10.836
STILL A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:12.204
HURDLES SO THAT WE MAKE SURE

02:00:12.271 --> 02:00:12.872
THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.340
CONTROLS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:15.975
THE MONEY GOES TOWARDS THOSE.

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:17.577
SO IT'S YEAH WE DON'T SNAP OUR

02:00:17.643 --> 02:00:18.644
FINGERS AND DISTRIBUTE THE

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.179
MONEY FOR THE PROJECTS WE HAVE

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.781
A REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE LOOK

02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:23.516
AT THE PROJECT AND WE EVALUATE

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:25.084
AND COMPARED TO A LOT OF OTHER

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.986
FACTORS WE ALSO GET DGS

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:28.521
INVOLVED TOO BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:30.690
EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA WE DON'T

02:00:30.756 --> 02:00:32.892
HAVE- BUT YEAH THE PROJECTS A

02:00:32.959 --> 02:00:34.093
LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN THE

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.261
QUEUE FOR SO LONG THAT I WOULD

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:38.764
CHARACTERIZE THAT SHOVEL READY.

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:41.000
SO WHO- THE THAT THAT PROCESS

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:43.002
THAT YOU REFER TO. IF WE WERE

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:45.037
TO ALLOCATE MONEY NOT THAT WE

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:45.705
CAN DO IT BUT IF WE WERE TO DO

02:00:45.771 --> 02:00:47.873
IT TODAY- THAT PROCESS WOULD

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:51.143
BEGIN. SOON AFTER TODAY. AS

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.280
OPPOSED TO IF IT'S IN THE-

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:56.148
UPCOMING YEAR'S BUDGET. IT

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:57.783
CAN'T- THAT PROCESS WOULDN'T

02:00:57.850 --> 02:00:59.318
BEGIN UNTIL THE FISCAL YEAR

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:01.120
BEGINS WITH IS THAT.

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:03.856
ESSENTIALLY CORRECT. THAT IS

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.291
CORRECT BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:06.726
POINT OUTIS THIS IS NOT THE

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.861
FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:09.795
AND RECEIVED BIRD MAINTENANCE

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:11.697
FUNDING. WE'VE DONE SO IN THE

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:14.367
PAST I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:14.867
ELEVEN TO TWELVE MILLION

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:16.068
DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:18.804
PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. AND SO WE

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:19.905
HAVE BUILT PROGRAMMATIC

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:21.407
EXPERTISE ON GETTING THE

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.376
PROCESS STARTED SO WE ARE WE

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:25.111
KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR THE FERRIS

02:01:25.177 --> 02:01:26.579
OF WORK THROUGH THIS BEFORE SO

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:27.647
THEY KNOW WHAT INFORMATION TO

PREVIOUSLY. SO YOU I DON'T I

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.586
DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:35.388
ALLOCATING THIS AND BUDGET YEAR

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:36.422
MEANS THAT WE START SOMETHING

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:38.090
FROM SCRATCH WHAT WE DO IS WE

02:01:38.157 --> 02:01:41.560
