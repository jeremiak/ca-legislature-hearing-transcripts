IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE A GROUP OF NATIVE AMERICANS MET TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT BODY FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATIVE AMERICAN CEMETERIES AND SECRET PLACES.

THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE AMERICAN. I KNOW THAT THEIR JOB WAS VERY MUCH IMPORTANT HERE WE HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF. YOUR WORK FILLING THE SKILLS THAT ARE THERE ANY IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO DETECTION. BUT THIS TIME LIKE HERE FROM. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF. A LOT OF WORK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO TO REMEDY THE A HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS AND THE STATE BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO. LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE FORWARD AND REALLY DO SOME PROGRESS OF WORK HERE. THAT'S THE ONE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND ME ARE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE. THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION WHAT IT IS TODAY AND HAVE REALLY BEEN HERE FOR SUPPORTING THIS WORK FOR DECADES. AT PRIOR TO MY COMING ON TO THAT NEED AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION WE HAD A STAFF OF ABOUT THREE TO FIVE PEOPLE FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND WE'RE NOW IN A POSITION LIKE ARE EXPLAINED IN A FEW MINUTES WE'RE GONNA. HAVE A STAFF OF AROUND. THREE TWENTY THREE SO I'M I'M HERE I'M AGAIN MY NAME IS CHRISTINA SNYDER I'M THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE DRY CREEK BAND OF POMO INDIANS IN CINEMA COUNTY I ALSO SERVICE THE GOVERNOR TRIBAL ADVISER BUT I'M NOT HERE WITHOUT HAD BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS I AS NEEDED. SO I A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN THIS WAS ACTUALLY ADOPTED IN JANUARY NINETEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH FORMER CHAIRMEN RAMOS AND UNDER. ACTING EXECUTIVE SECRETARY DEBBIE TRIED TRIED HUESO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT FORMATION THEY CAN. ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT REALLY NECESSARY HERE BUT PART OF SO WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED WAS ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I CAME ON AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND THIS HAS BEEN MY ROAD MAP IN DEVELOPING THE LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION. WHEN THE STRATEGIC PLAN WAS ADOPTED WHICH ALL OF YOU HAVE A COPY OF IN YOUR AGENDA PACKET IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A I'M MORE ON IN DEPTH LOOK. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES OF THE COMMISSION THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AND THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION WAS GETTING INCREASINGLY. BIRD AND- LIKE I SAID THAT THE COMMISSION STAFF RANGE FROM ANYWHERE FROM THREE PEOPLE FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS TO FIVE ASH PEOPLE AND THEN. HAS TRICKLED UP TO ABOUT NINE ASH. AND SO THERE WERE AYE BUT- AS OUR TRIBES HAVE INCREASINGLY MADE MORE SPACE FOR THEMSELVES AT THE TABLE IN CALIFORNIA STATE POLITICS. THERE HAS BEEN. A LOT MORE INCORPORATION OF THE LIST THAT WE MAINTAIN IF THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING STREAMS AND OTHER ACCESS TO. A COMMITTEES OTHER LEGISLATIVE ON VEHICLES. AND SO THERE IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON OUR AGENCY HAS. MULTIPLIED BY QUITE A LOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE EARLY. AND OF AGENCY WIDE TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND SO THE THOSE WEAKENED. THAT AREA OF BEING OVER BURDENED FOR THE LAWS THAT THIS COMMISSION ME ARE OVERSEAS WHICH IS ALSO AT THE BACK OF THIS PACKET IT'LL LIST ALL OF THE LAWS THAT WE CURRENTLY OVERSEE AND NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE ADEQUATELY BEING. ADDRESSED AT THIS MOMENT BUT- WITH THAT SAID I'LL GO THROUGH KIND OF WHAT WE ARE WHAT THE LONG TERM VISION AS HOWEVER ADDRESSING AND WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. THIS FIVE YEAR PLAN IS INTENDED TO RUN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO HOPEFULLY BY THEN I CAN COME BACK AND REPORT OR MY- WHOEVER ELSE IS IN THIS POSITION CAN COME BACK AND REPORT THAT WE'VE CHECKED EVERYTHING OFF AND WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT FOR NOW I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU KIND OF A QUICK UPDATE OF WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG THAT COULD BE OVER ON PAGE TWENTY AT OUR PRIORITIES GOALS. AND OBJECTIVES 420-182-2020 TWO. SO THE FIRST PRIORITY IS FISCAL STABILITY. THIS COMMISSION HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN. HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO THE ABS INFLOWS OF AT AT A CYCLICAL ECONOMY WHICH EVERY OTHER AGENCY IN COMMISSION IS AS WELL IN IN ECONOMIC DOWN TIMES AGENCIES SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION ARE SEEN AS MORE EXPENDABLE I THINK BY THE LEGISLATURE AND BY THE ADMINISTRATION SO IT'S NOT ALL ON YOU ALL BUT I'M- I WHEN WE NEED TO BE. WHEN WE NEED TO BE PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE AND KEEPING PEOPLE ALIVE JUST THIS WORK GETS DE PRIORITIZED AND SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS AGENCY HAS BEEN OR THAT THIS COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING TOWARD IS FIGURING OUT OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING STREAMS SO THAT WE'RE LESS RELIANT ON THE GENERAL FUND AND ON THAT FLOWS THE ECONOMY AND SO. THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES IT WOULD BE TO GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE THAT APPROPRIATED TO THE COMMISSION BY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE COST OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS AT COMMISSION SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. ADEQUATELY SPUR OF THE CULTURE RESOURCES BURIALS HUMAN REMAINS AND SACRED SITES THAT WE ARE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING BY THE STATE SO WITH THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING THE COMMISSION TO CHARGE FOR SIX PLANTS INVENTORY SEARCHES AND SB A TRIBAL SB EIGHTEEN TRIBAL CONSULTATION LESS AND SO WE HAVE THAT AUTHORIZATION WE'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING REGULATIONS SO. THAT WE CAN DO IT AND SO WE. OF WHEN I CAME ON AS AS MANY OF YOU UNDERSTAND. TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS CAN ALWAYS BE A LITTLE BIT A LOT OF WORK IN FIGURING OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ORIENT AND KIND OF GETTING EVERYBODY ACCLIMATED AND SO. WHEN I CAME ON WE WERE ALSO IN A PLACE OF HAVING OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY STAFF UP THE AGENCY AND SO WE'VE SHIFTED PRIORITIES AND NOW WE'RE BACK ON OUR REGULAR. REGULATIONS WHAT WE'VE DONE I TO THIS POINT IS EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF MY STAFF HAS GONE TO OUR TRAINING ON REGULATIONS SO EACH OF THEM CAN ACTUALLY HOUSE THEM SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF DO. SEPARATE TRACKS AT THE SAME TIME SO THESE REGULATIONS ARE IN ADDITION TO OTHER REGULATIONS THAT WERE WORKING ON BUT WILL BE DONE KIND OF AT THE ON THE SAME TRACK SO HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU AN ESTIMATE BECAUSE THE STATE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER THAN I THINK IT WILL BUT- WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE WE SHOULD BE ON A GOOD IN A GOOD PLACE TO START WORKING THROUGH THAT REGULATIONS PROCESS BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL. CONCERNS OF BEING INCLUSIVE AND HAVING BROAD BASED CONSULTATION WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. THOSE TIME LINES ARE NECESSARILY MUCH LONGER BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHATEVER WE COME UP WITH ACCURATELY ACCURATELY REFLECTS WHAT THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WANT. AND SO I. THAT'S IN PROCESS. THE SPECIAL INTERESTS LICENSE PLATE CAMPAIGN. IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH READY WE'RE JUST. THE TIMING WISE BIRD WERE HAVING A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT RELEASES BUT THE BIGGER RELEASE WILL BE ON NATIVE AMERICAN DAY. WHICH THIS COMMITTEE AS IT HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND THE CHAIRMAN HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND SO THE BIG RELEASE WHEN YOU CAN SIGN UP AND PURCHASE A SPECIAL. SPECIAL INTERESTS LICENSE PLATE. IS GOING TO BE ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH WHICH IS MADE AMERICAN DAY. YOU CAN KIND OF DO IT BEFORE THEN I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE READY TO TAKE THOSE ORDERS OF THIS WEEK BUT I'M NOT GONNA COMMIT TO ANYTHING JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS. AND THOUGH IT. I THE COMMISSION ITSELF VOTED ON PRIORITY PROGRAMS AND AREAS TO FOR THAT THAT LICENSE PLATE WITH FINE SO IT DOESN'T GO TO JUST RANDOM STUFF THAT GOES TO ACTUAL. WORK ON SITE PROTECTION AS BE EIGHTEEN IT GOES TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS RELATED TO THE CORE LOOK AT THE COMMISSION. ARE THOSE LICENSE PLATES FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. HI THERE AT PROTECT NATIVE CULTURE DOT COM AND IN ORDER THERE AS WELL AND THEY HAVE EIGHTY OKAY. GET WHICH WAS DONATED. IT'S NOT A FORMER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY ISN'T AT GOT AS. ON HIS ON EVERYBODY KIND OF SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY AS A STATE AND AS CONSTITUENTS IN AS MEMBERS OF THIS PLACE BUT WE NOW CALL CALIFORNIA. WE THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY PRIORITIZE IS THIS WORKING KNOWLEDGE IS WHO IS WHO IS HERE PRIOR TO STATEHOOD SO. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO BUY ONE GET GET IT PERSONALIZED. GET WHATEVER. GET WHATEVER NATIVE WORD OR TRIBE YOU WANT TO GET ON THERE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO START GETTING. YOU KNOW BOOKED UP AND YOU MAY HAVE TO BE LIKE. I'M A PRINCESS TEN OR SOMETHING SO. AND THEN FINALLY AT. IN EXPLORING OTHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING STRATEGIES WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THIS PART YET. AND THIS IS CHARGING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR TRAININGS. APPLYING FOR GRANTS AND CHARGING FOR PUBLICATIONS LIKE THE CULTURE RESOURCES HANDBOOK BITES THAT SAID. WE HAVE PULLED UP THE OLD CULTURE RESOURCES HANDBOOK TO THAT BUT WITH THAT LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO DEBBIE YEAH. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ABOUT TWO MORE AT BATS LIKE THIRTY YEARS AGO. SO IT'S LIKE TWENTY TO ME. DEBBIE IS ONE OF OUR OUR BEST RESOURCES BECAUSE OF JUST THE COMMITMENT SHE THOUGHT TO THE AGENCY WORK ON THE COMMISSION FOR THIRTY YEARS. SO SHE WAS THERE WHEN WE HAD OUR LAST CALL FOR RESOURCES HAND BACK OUT AND SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT WE'RE GONNA REFRESH IT AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL ALSO BE ON. CALL SERVE THE PURPOSE OF SUSTAINING THE COMMISSION BUT ALSO. OF HELPING TO BE A RESOURCE TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES ON THE LAWS THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. SO PRIORITY TO SUCCESSION RETENTION PLANNING AND RECRUITMENT. I'M THE ISSUE HERE WAS. PRIOR TO JOINING THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION HAD AGAIN I. KNOW THREE TO FIVE STAFF AT SOMETIMES. LIKE A V. IN THE BLAST YEARS UP TO NINE. HAD A FLAT STRUCTURE AND SO. WAS SEEN AS IF YOU GOT A POSITION WITHIN THE COMMISSION THERE WAS NOT REALLY ANYWHERE TO GO EXCEPT TO PROMOTE IN PLACE IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO STAY AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE COMMITTED TO THIS WORK. WHAT WE'VE DONE NOW AND YOU CAN LOOK ON THE LAST PAGE IS ACTUALLY A PROPOSED ORG CHART. AND WE ACTUALLY MESSED WITH THIS A LITTLE BIT. BASED ON AND- ON AND. ON THE BUDGET PROCESS BASICALLY SO IT LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW BUT AS ADOPTED IT IS BASICALLY LIKE A TOP DOWN STRUCTURE WHERE THERE ARE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO KIND OF JUMP AROUND IF THEY WANT TO BUILD THEIR SKILLS AND STAY WITH THE AGENCY LONG TERM. SO PART OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A LOT OF POSITIONS WHICH TAKES QUITE SOME TIME BY IT. WILL HAVE EIGHTY CHIEF DEPUTY THAT WILL OVERSEE THEM BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S THE EVERY DAY LIKE. IF A STATE AGENCY OR A LEAD AGENCY NEEDS TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO CONTACT WHICH TRIBES TO CONTACT THE CONTACT THAT DEPARTMENT. AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE BULK OF OUR DAY TO DAY WORK WE WILL ALSO BE ESTABLISHING A CHIEF COUNSEL POSITION WHICH WILL OVERSEE ALL OF THE LEGAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING. WE HAVE A NUMBER WHICH I'LL- I'LL TALK ABOUT NOW ACTUALLY OF AT CLINICS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM AHMED AT SEVERAL LAW SCHOOLS. AND BUT ALSO THE LITIGATION ANY SORT OF SETTLEMENTS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY SORT OF ENFORCEMENT THAT THE AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND SO LONG TERM THE IDEA IS TO YOU REALLY CREATE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE ON ALL OF THIS WORK IN A WAY THAT IS THOUGHTFUL AND- BROAD BASED. AND SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING OP AND WE ARE WE HAVE CREATED CAREER PATHS THAT MAKES SENSE TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF THIS. LIKE I MENTIONED WHEN I CAME ON THE PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A SMALL CLINIC AT UCLA LAW I THAT I IT. WAS GOING TO DO A NEEDS ASSESSMENT BASICALLY FOR THE LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREAS. BY ONE OF OUR COMMISSIONERS COMMISSIONER MARANDA AT LIVE DOT INITIATIVE LAST YEAR AND HAS DEVELOPED SOME REALLY GOOD. SOME GOOD CAPACITY BUILDING MATERIALS FOR SOME OF THE TRIBES IN THE AREA. THIS YEAR UCLA LAW WAS BLESSED WITH A SIGNIFICANT. I. BRUNEI GUYS IN CREATING A LONG TERM SYSTEMIC. CLINIC UNDER THE DIRECTION I'M SAN MANUEL SO SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN INDIAN COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST FOCUSED ON TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES IT'S EVERYTHING BUT WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT THAT WE- SEND TO UCLA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CULTURAL RESOURCE. THAT CULTURAL RESOURCE WORK IS STILL DONE SO I SPOKE WITH THAT NEW DIRECTOR LEARNED AND HEALTH CARD SHE'S A FORMER CLASSMATE OF MINE ACTUALLY AND- SHE IS GOING TO BE. LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE I'D AND BUILD UP CAPACITY FOR TRIBES LIKE THE NON FIRE RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THE AREA AND SOME OF THE TRIBES WITH FEWER RESOURCES AND- SO SHE'S GOING TO REACHING OUT TO SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CREATING MATERIALS LIKE PREMEDICATION PLANS. AND LOOKING AT HOW. THOSE STUDENTS CAN ALSO PROVIDE TRAININGS TO OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE AND SO. LONG TERM PLAN IS TO CREATE MORE CAPACITY BUT ALSO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS ON THE THESE BODY OF LAWS SO IN THE EVENT THAT THEY DID WANT TO COME WORK FOR THE COMMISSION OR IN HOUSE FOR TRIBES AND BUILD THOSE THAT CAPACITY THAT WE ARE. INOCULATING THE STUDENTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE WORKING WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ON THIS INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE AREA. I'M SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CLINICS THIS YEAR WE REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH UC BERKELEY. AND THEY WILL BE HIRING A STAFF ATTORNEY TO OVERSEE A PRO BONO PROGRAM THAT WILL BE DOING SIMILAR WORK IN THE BAY AREA AND I'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW TRIBES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HAVING STUDENTS COME IN HOUSE AND HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR CULTURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE UP AND RUNNING BY JANUARY. WITH THE IDEA THAT EVENTUALLY IT'LL TURN INTO A FULL FLEDGED PROGRAM AS WELL UC DAVIS AS WELL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF JUDGE CHRISTINE WILLIAMS FROM IRAQ IS ALSO TAKING ON SOME OF THIS WORK SO WE'RE HOPING TO BOTH ADDRESS CAPACITY FOR TRIBES THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE FULL CULTURE RESOURCE TEAMS AND HOUSE. BUT ALSO TO HELP BUILD UP THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA SO THAT WE CAN. CREATE MORE OF A PIPELINE INTO THIS WORK. WE ARE BRINGING ON A LEGAL FELLOW THIS FALL FOR ME STILL ALLIES WHILE AND THEN I'M I'VE MADE IT. THE OFFER OPEN TO EACH OF THESE CLINICS THAT. IF THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS WORK OR AND SOME OF THE BROADER. BODY OF TRIBAL POLICY WORK ARM. UNDER MY OTHER HAT THAT I'M WILLING TO TAKE ON SHADOWING AND- OTHER OTHER. I CAN USE ALL THE HELP I CAN GET. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT IS TRYING TO CREATE. A BASICALLY. PIPELINE IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD BECAUSE WE YEAH IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THAT IN THIS CASE BUT I FIVE. I'D LIKE TO CREATE A PATH TO BUILD UP THE BODY THIS WORKING AND HAVE MORE PEOPLE HELPING US DO THE HEAVY LIFTING SO THAT'S IN PROCESS. AND I WILL WE HAVE JUST A FEW MORE. PRIORITIES. WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON AND BUILDING UP THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO STAFF IN THE EVENT OF TURNOVER AND TRAINING MATERIALS SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOUSE IS THAT WERE STANDARDISING ALL OF OUR PER PROCEDURES ARE PROCESSES WERE UPDATING FORMS WERE ALSO OPEN TO IF TRIBES FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE NOT WORKING WE WANT TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE- WE WERE NOT THE ONES THAT HAVE TO NAVIGATE THESE LAWS WE JUST TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS THE STICKING POINT AND SO. RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING A LOT OF OUR INTAKE FORMS BUT ALSO ON THE BACK AND CREATING PROCESSES SO THAT NEWER STAFF CAN JUST KIND OF BASICALLY LOOK AT A CHECKLIST OF THE RESOURCES THAT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHEN THEY'RE DETERMINING CERTAIN THINGS LIKE MOST LIKELY JUST DESCENDANTS. OR AREAS OF INTEREST AND THAT WE WERE NOT PEOPLE LIKE DEBBIE CAN ALSO RETIRE EVENTUALLY. AND SO STAND RISING PROCESSES AND THEN ALSO. WHAT WE'RE DOING INTERNALLY IS AT OUR STAFF MEETINGS ARE HAVING INTERNAL TRAININGS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AND WE'RE FILMING THOUGH SO THAT WHEN WE DO ON BOARD PEOPLE. THEY CAN JUST TAKE A LOOK AT NOT A DIFFERENT STAFF TIME FOR THAT AS WELL. SO THE THIRD PRIORITY ON PAGE TWENTY SIX IS INCREASED INTERNAL COMPLIANCE. AND SO. CREATING AN INTERNAL COMPLIANCE CALENDAR AND CHECKLIST AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHECKLIST OF ALL OF THIS STRATEGIC PLAN TO SEE WHERE WE'RE AT AND WHETHER WE'RE HEADING OR BENCHMARKS. ADOPT REGULATIONS AGAIN WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT SIX THAT THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY GOING TO BE. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BY EACH OF THE STAFF AT EACH OF THE REGULATIONS HAS A SENIOR STAFF AND A JUNIOR STAFFER ASSIGNED TO IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GET THROUGH WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THESE NEED TO BE TO GO THROUGH LEGAL I'M- A AT HIGHS AS WELL BUT WE WERE ADVISED BY SOME OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES THAT. IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER TO HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON ALL OF THE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS AND HAVING TO NAVIGATE IT HELP. SHEPHERD THOUGHT SO THAT THEY CAN. MAKE REGULATIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE FOR THE SPECIFIC THING SO THAT'S KIND OF. WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT. WE'RE INCREASING STAFFING TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL COMPLIANCE. AND IMPLEMENTING CAL NOT PRO WE JUST HIRED OR WE JUST CONTRACTED WITH CALIFORNIA ANY LEGAL SERVICES TO HELP US DO THAT CALIFORNIA ANY LEGAL SERVICES FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE AND WHERE IS. A AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM THAT IS DEDICATED TO SERVING TRIBES KIND OF AS A NON PROFIT AND SO THEY HELP A LOT OF THAT THE NEED YOUR TRIBES BUT ALSO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE ARM. MANY OF THE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA WERE TERMINATED DURING THE TERMINATION ERA THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE LITIGATION THAT. BROUGHT THEM BACK SO THEY HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE WORKING ON SOME OF THESE MORE SENSITIVE ISSUES AND WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE THEM ON AND THINK THAT THEY'LL DO A REALLY GOOD JOB AND- IN DEVELOPING. THE COUNT ACT PRESS. BODY I HAVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS KIND OF US ACROSS AYE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCESS WHERE WILL BE PROCESSING CLAIMS IN HOUSE AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHY WE'RE BUILDING UP OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT AS WELL. BUT SO THEY'LL BE KIND OF SHEPHERDING THOUGHT PROCESS AND THEN THE FOURTH PRIORITY INCREASED TRAINING FOR STAFF TRIED AND STAKEHOLDERS. WERE DOING THAT AND KIND OF A LAYERED WAY LIKE I SAID THE UC'S ARE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF THE YEAH. TRAININGS FOR TRIBES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT CAPACITY AND THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THESE LAWS I'M GOING TO BE. I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY THIS ON THE RECORD BUT WHEN I DO HIRED. WHAT I DO HIGHER. WHATEVER IT'S NOT LIKE IT'LL POP UP LATER IN MY CAREER. WHAT I DO HIGHER DEPUTY FOR MY TRIBAL ADVISER POSITION I'VE I TENTATIVELY REACHED OUT TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TUNING DOING THE TRAININGS ON AB FIFTY TWO STATEWIDE INITIALLY. I AM AND I'M HOPING TO HAVE MY DEPUTY SET THEIR PART TIME I'M SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF. HELP THEM REINVIGORATE THAT PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE MORE TRAINING FROM A LOCAL AND STATE LEVELS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A FEW YEARS BEFORE SINCE WE'VE DONE THAT AND SO. EVERYTHING OWLS WERE STILL WORKING ON AND IT IS A FIVE YEAR PLAN I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A YEAR AND A HALF SO PLEASE HAVE SOME PATIENCE WITH ME BUT WE ARE. WE DO HAVE WIFI NOW WHICH IS GREAT. WE'RE EXPANDING INTO THE BUILDING THAT WERE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO LAUNCH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO COMPLETE THIS THIS PLAN AND SO. IT IS THERE SOME GROWING PAINS AND IT'S TAKING SOME TIME BUT I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT. THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. THE GOALS IN THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED IN HERE AND HOPEFULLY BUILD ON THE GOOD WORK OF FORMER CHAIRMAN RAMOS. AND THE REST OF THE COMMISSION THAT HAS BEEN. CHUGGING ALONG FOR SOME TIME WITH A LITTLE HELP IN LITTLE RESOURCES. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE PRESENTATIONS WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT JOINED US LORETTA GONZALEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JIM COOPER. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO. SO THE PANEL THIS DISCUSSION IS ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S THERE THERE'S AN IMPORTANT KEY THAT YOU BROUGHT UP BUT IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SO REMEMBER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS AGAIN HISTORIC HEARING I THANK YOU TO BOTH OF OUR WITNESSES MR WAY FOR THE HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE AND THEN BESIDE A FOR A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING I MEAN I'M I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY WHAT ALL IS GOING ON FIRST QUESTION WHO'S THE CHAIRPERSON NOW THAT MR HOME IS THAT IT. I'D HAVE TO ASK THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WE HAVE AN ACTING CHAIR PERSON WHO IS LARA MARANDA FROM PITANGA WE WILL EVENTUALLY HOLD AN ELECTION PROBABLY AT THE NEXT MEETING BUT WE'RE ALSO BACK FILLING FROM THE VACANCY OKAY IN A SPEECH TO A YOU KNOW HE HE HE MADE MENTION WOULD BEEN DISCUSSING THE LICENSE PLATE IN THE INTERNAL POLITICS OF INDIAN COUNTRY AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT WITH REGARD TO DIVERSITY BOTH OF THE COMMISSION AND IF SOME OF THE COMMITTEES AND INFORM THE COMMISSION OR ADVISE THE COMMISSION. WHAT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN TO TRYING GET GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY I RECOGNIZE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING AND QUALIFIED AND ABLE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT THERE'S ALSO GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES SO WITH IN SAN DIEGO WE ARE BLESSED WITH MANY MANY DIFFERENT TRIBES AND THAT ALSO HAVE SOME OF THOSE INTERNAL DIVISIONS CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT EFFORTS IF ANY ARE BEING MADE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THE COMMISSION ITSELF HAS GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IN TERMS OF THE- OF NATIVE REPRESENTATION. SURE AND SO THE COMMISSION IS THAT ARE A GOVERNOR APPOINTED COMMISSION SO. KIND OF FREE EXECUTIVE ORDER BE TEN ELEVEN EDGE BUT PROBABLY LATER THAN THAT EVEN. I THINK THAT WELL I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE BUT THE- STATES UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF INDIAN COUNTRY WAS PROBABLY THE. AND NOT TO AT AT TO ANYONE'S FAULT I THINK THAT THERE IS JUST YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WAS LESS DEVELOPED AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD THIS GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED TO FINDING. I GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CANDIDATES SIMILAR TO IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FINDS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MEMBER HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. TO I THINK MAYBE I'M SPEAKING ON THE PANELS WELL BUT- I. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT WE WANT TO BE AS INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE AS POSSIBLE SO. MOVING FORWARD WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THIS COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO TRIBES AND WHERE POSSIBLE TRYING TO. ACCOUNT FOR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES WHILE BEING IN LINE WITH THE MANDATES OF THE STATUTE. IN I RECOGNIZE PRECARIOUS SITUATION A LOT OF COMPETING FACTORS I JUST OF THAT BIG BIG JUST FROM WHAT THE CUT THE COUNTY I REPRESENT WE KNOW THIS IS THE THING. IT'S HARD TO DO WITH NINE POSITIONS AND WITHIN THE NIAGARA COMMITTEE IN OTHERS AND YOU JUST IT'S OF IT'S A THREAD THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE STRATEGIC PLANNING SHE MENTION OF REALLY DOING A LOT OF OUT REACH A LOT OF TRAINING. AND ONE ON MY HOPE BUT I HOPE IS AMONG THE MANY THINGS THAT WILL COME FROM THAT IS OPPORTUNITY GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED. AND I YOU MENTION THESE ARE GOING TO TWELVE POINT HE'S AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROVEN HIS UNDERSTANDING CONCERN IN AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S NATIVES. OF THROUGH THE ISSUING OF THE OF THE APOLOGY WHICH IS INCREDIBLE GESTURE AND ONE THAT NOW NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP WITH ACTION WHICH IS THE FIRST TO NOTICE THAT AND I THINK YOUR PRESENCE IN THIS PLAN. INDICATE THAT THAT'S MORE THAN APOLOGY THIS IT'LL ACTION IN THIS ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY SB FOR MY COLLEAGUES AT WORK FOR GAME TO DO OUR PART TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. WRITING PAST WRONGS I'M AN AVID LASTLY JUST SAY IN THIS REGARD THERE'S A LIST OF GROUP POLICIES THAT THE SUBSEQUENT. I DID SPEAK TO THIS BUT TO BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THIS IS FAR BEYOND GAMING RIGHT THIS IS A BALLOT QUALITY OF LIFE WRITING HISTORIC INJUSTICES THE TREMENDOUS POVERTY AND OTHER SOCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO INDIAN COUNTRY. AND BEFORE AGAIN WHY THIS COMMITTEE HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT I WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT OUR CONCERN AND INTEREST IS IN A VERY NARROW BAND I THINK RECENT LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE AS IT TO ADD MENTIONED. IN IN YOUR TESTIMONY IS A TRIED WAY WE'RE TRYING TO WORKING DIRECTIONS. AROUND CULTURAL ADORNMENTS REPATRIATION AND SO ON. SO FOR IT. I THINK THE CALL OUT FROM THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SHOULD BE TO EVERY CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TO GIVE US ADDITIONAL IDEAS OF THE WORK THAT MUST BE DONE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A AGENCY THAT'S WILLING TO DO WORK WE HAVE A EXECUTIVE THAT'S ANIMATED AND LIVE A LEGISLATURE THAT'S WILLING TO DO IT AND FOR TOO LONG A LOT OF THESE ISSUES NOT BEEN ADDRESSED NOW'S THE TIME START WORKING ON THEM SO. THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMENT LAWMAKERS COMES CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MEMBER GLORIA. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISH MAKE ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. I'M. WANT TO JOIN IN AND RECOGNIZING HOW IS A STORY THIS IS AS THE FIRST SELECT COMMITTEE ON ON NATIVE AMERICAN FAIRS AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND VERY PLEASED TO HEAR HOW THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE THAT THE COMMISSION. AND ABILITY TO EXPAND AND EXPAND THE SCOPE AND WORK. AS AS THE CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON AT UC BERKELEY AND THE REMAINS AT UC BERKELEY IS THAT AN ISSUE THAT IS ADDRESSED BY THE COMMISSION. WE ARE ADDRESSING IT. SORT OF THROUGH THE STRATEGIC PLAN PART OF WHY I WE REACHED OUT TO UC BERKELEY ALLOTTED TO CREATE THE FIRST ACT CLINIC THERE IS TO BUILD IN SOME OF THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE SO THAT YOU THEIR SISTER AT UC BERKELEY UNDERGRAD AND THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE A RESOURCE WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING TO THEM AND KIND OF SORTING THROUGH THESE ISSUES SO THAT THEY CAN BE MORE RESPECTFUL OF THE LAWS THAT THERE THEY SHOULD BE COMPLYING WITH. ANOTHER WAY THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IS UNDER ON AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA AT SPONSORED LAST YEAR I WE'RE ASSISTING IN THOSE EFFORTS TO CREATE A SYSTEM WIDE YOU SEEN I POLICY BUT ALSO A SYSTEM WIDE UC. MADE AMERICAN POLICY AND SO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE ALL OF THE REALLY GOOD TRIBAL KNOW HOW ON THOSE COMMITTEES AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED TO TâM AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE SO FAR JUST TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT'S IN LINE WITH THE REALITY OF HOW WE OPERATE ON THE STATE SIDE I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT I HAVE EVERY TRUSTS ALL THE PRESS IN THE WORLD WITH THE COMMITTEES THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF TRIBAL CHAIRMAN. I DIRECTING AND THAT WORK AND THEY ACTUALLY ARE PRODUCING SOME SOME GOOD WORK THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE PUBLICLY I THINK IN THAT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND SO WE ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON THAT AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE THE COMMISSION I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR. CAL MAG PRIOR WHICH REQUIRES REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE OF GUIDES FROM BASICALLY ALL STATE MUSEUMS WHICH INCLUDES THE UC'S ON SOME SENSE AS I THINK THAT PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE USE YOU TO DO IS JUST DO THE RIGHT THING WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW AS WELL AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN YOU KNOW WORK TOGETHER IN COLLABORATION AND GET. THE BIGGER ISSUE I THINK IS MORE OF THE CULTURAL SHIFT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE TO BE HONEST SO THE MORE THAT ALL OF US CAN EMBRACE THE SPIRIT OF RESPECT FOR NATIVE PEOPLES BUT ALSO NATIVE REMAINS. THEN WILL BE GONE IN A GOOD DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA ASSEMBLY WOMAN WENDY CARILLO AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. CAN SOMEONE OR GLORIA COULD WE DO SOMETHING LAST YEAR WITH REGARDS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN LAST YEAR. ON WRITING A LETTER OF SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UC'S WERE GIVING BACK SOME OF THE. SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE STATUS ON MATTER HOW CAN HOW CAN BE MORE SO HOW CAN WE BE MORE SUPPORTIVE. I THINK WE'RE STILL WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE WE'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT'S ATTENTION PRESENT APOLOGY. ACTUALLY CONVENE A PRESIDENT'S YOU SEE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN ISSUES. AND MATT ODD I THINK THE LAST DAY IN JANUARY AND SO THAT. THAT COMMITTEE ITSELF IS MEETING QUARTERLY TO DISCUSS NOT JUST REPATRIATION ISSUES BY THINGS LIKE OUR RETENTION OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE STUDENTS. AND OTHER ISSUES ON LIKE HIRING AND ALL OF THAT THAT CREATE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE IT LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR NATE. TO WANT TO STAY IN THOSE SCHOOLS. SO IT'S WORKING ON KIND OF THE BODY OF WORK AND THEN ALSO EACH YOU SEE IS GOING TO HAVE TO. ADOPT A POLICY AS WELL ON THIS ON BOTH ON THIS AND THAT THANK YOU FOR NOT PAYING CAL NOT PRO WORK WHICH IS THE REPATRIATION WORK. BY THAT COMMITTEE CREATED A SUB COMMITTEE THAT'S CHARGED WITH CREATING WITH THE SYSTEM WIDE POLICY WHICH IS. ALMOST FINAL AT THIS POINT SO THINGS ARE PROGRESSING INTO AN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE WAY THE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED AS- REPRESENTATIVE OF. BOTH AT THE DIVERSITY OF GEOGRAPHY BUT ALSO OF THE RECOGNIZED AND NOT RECOGNIZE TRIES TO HAVE INTEREST IN THIS WORK SO. IT'S MOVING IT'S GOT THE ATTENTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND SHE'S MADE HERSELF AVAILABLE AND. AND HAS REALLY I SUPPORT THIS WORK AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT IN A IN THERE IS A BILL THAT MYSELF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA DID CO AUTHOR TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT SIGNED INTO. LAW BY THE GOVERNOR BEFORE WE WENT ON. SUMMER RECESS TO ADD ANOTHER NATIVE AMERICAN TO THE YOU SEE NOW PRO BOARD SO THAT WE'RE DOING THAT WORK MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE- THAT THE COMMITTEE IS WELL BALANCED WITH NATIVE AMERICANS ON IT. SO THERE IS STILL WORK THAT THAT'S BEING DONE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

MISSED RAVEN COSSUS AND MISS ANNABELLE HERNANDEZ FROM THE SALMON WELL BAND OF MISSION INDIANS SO WE COULD HAVE THEM COME FORWARD. THANK YOU YOU AND THIS IS A VERY. TOPIC THAT REALLY ADDRESSES ON CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ADDRESSES A NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC THAT ALSO NEEDS TO HAVE. ADVOCACY IN ATTENTION TO NAY GOES SOME HAND IN HAND WITH THE GOVERNOR SOME EXECUTIVE ORDER OF APOLOGIES OF ATROCITIES IN GENOCIDE TOWARDS CALIFORNIAN TO PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO BRINGS. TWO FOUR FOUR FRUITION THE IMPORTANCE AND ACADEMIC EPIDEMIC THAT STILL CONTINUES TO PLAGUE INDIAN COUNTRY TODAY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS FIRST MEETING OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND TO BRING THIS TOPIC FORWARD OUR FIRST SPEAKER WILL BE A MISS LORI GONZALEZ FROM THE- RING CONN BAND OF. THE SEND YOU INTO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I WAS GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE BECAUSE EPIDEMIC IS RIGHT. I'M. THIS EPIDEMIC AFFECTS ALL OF INDIAN COUNTRY AS YOU SIDE. AND NOT JUST OUR COUNTRY THIS ENTIRE CONTINENT SOUTH AMERICA CENTRAL AMERICA NORTH AMERICA. WE'RE ALL AFFECTED ARM BUT. AS CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IS RANKED SIXTH IN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES OF MISSING AND MURDERED. WOMEN INDIGENOUS WOMEN THIS IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. THEY BELIEVE IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE CENSUS IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. NATIVE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVERALL IN THE US EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. 84% MANY OF THESE TAX A TAX ULTIMATELY RESULT IN DEATH MAKING MURDER. THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN. WITH FOUR DAUGHTERS. AND SEVEN GRANDDAUGHTERS THIS BRINGS ME. FRIGHTENS ME. IT IS A COUNCIL WOMAN. WHO REPRESENTS MY TRIBE THEIR HEALTH THEIR WELFARE THEIR SECURITY. I FIND THIS UNACCEPTABLE. MOST OF THESE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED BY NON NATIVES. MANY ARE COMMITTED ON INDIAN LAND BUT MORE AND MORE THESE CRIMES ARE HAPPENING IN CITIES WHERE THERE ARE LARGE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS. ON RESERVATIONS INVESTIGATIONS BY TRIBAL POLICE AND SECURITY IT IS OFTEN HAMPERED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE REMOTE AREAS WE ARE IN. LACK OF FUNDING AND SUPPORT BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IF I MAKE A CALL IT MIGHT BE HOURS. BEFORE ANYONE CUTS CAN MAKE IT OUT. THEN OFF RESERVATION SEEKING JUSTICE. LET ALONE ANSWERS IN A LARGER AND I'M FAMILIAR SYSTEM WHICH IS ALREADY OVER TAXED LEADS TO. DEBT AND SOMETIMES FOR PEOPLE AND COLD CASES. I KNOW THIS PERSONALLY I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER WHO RAN AWAY. AND SHE WAS MISSING FOR CLOSE TO A YEAR. I WAS LIVING ON THE RESERVATION I CALLED THE POLICE SHE'S FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEY SAID SHE HADN'T BEEN GONE LONG ENOUGH. FOR THEM TO CONSIDER HER RUNAWAY. THANK GOD I GOT HER BACK AND I GOT HER BACK IN ONE PIECE NOT EMOTIONALLY BUT I GOT HER BACK. SHE HAD BEEN OUT OF STATE FOR MOST OF THAT TIME. WHEN SHE LEFT THE STATE SHE DISAPPEARED I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT. IN SAN DIEGO NORTH COUNTY WHERE MY RESERVATION IS LOCATED ABOVE US IS LAW HOW YOUR RESERVATION THEY HAVE STARTED A GRASS ROOTS. SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR WOMEN CALLED THE OF ALLOCATE PROGRAM. IT ADDRESSES SAFETY FOR NATIVE WOMEN AND THEY HAVE AN ANNUAL WALK TO BRING AWARENESS TO THIS GROWING VIOLENT EPIDEMIC. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN I FIRST WAS ELECTED TO COUNCIL. WE WERE HOSTING THAT WALK I'D NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE. RAISING SIX KIDS I WAS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS BUT I WENT AND BEFORE I WENT I DID SOME RESEARCH. ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN I WAS HORRIFIED THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE WALK. HOPING IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WELL IT'S TEN YEARS LATER. THE PROBLEM IS GROWING. I AM ALMOST SIXTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND I'M STILL WALKING. I AM VERY HOPEFUL. THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL STAND UP FOR OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. ASKING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. IN MAKING THEIR SAFETY A PRIORITY HOW DO WE DO THAT. GIVING A VOICE TO THE MISSING. GIVE JUSTICE TO THE MURDERED. GIVE SOLUTIONS TO STOP VICTIMIZATION. OUR WOMEN NEED TO HEAR. I KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT LESS THAN. A STRESS AGAIN 84% AND I LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN SITTING NEXT TO ME. IF WE MEET AGAIN NEXT YEAR. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THEY'LL STILL BE HERE. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. I KNOW THAT. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE HAS BEEN AMENDED TWICE M. YOU KNOW I LOVE THE IDEA OF A TASK FORCE I REALLY DO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS AND THE MORE PEOPLE THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE IDEAS. BUT FROM WHAT I READ. YOU KNOW THE PROPOSED THERE THE GOAL IS TO GET A REPORT PREPARED BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I THINK THAT REALLY IS. WITH HOW GOVERNMENT RUNS AND ALL THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE TO GO INTO THIS IT IS REALISTIC. BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE CASUALTIES ARE PILING UP THE BODIES. ARE PILING UP. AND FOR PARENTS. GRANDPARENTS AUNTS AND UNCLES WHO GRIEVE WHO WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BECOME PART OF THE INVISIBLE. IT'S TOO LONG. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. BECAUSE EVERY LIFE MATTERS. IN OUR NATIVE CULTURE ALL WOMEN ARE SACRED WE HAVE A LIFE GIVERS. WHERE WERE THE A PROTECTION. SO HELP PROTECT OUR LIFE GIVERS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA I AM SO PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN I'M SO PROUD TO BE CALIFORNIANS. I BRAG ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE PROGRESSIVE STATE AND WE'RE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT OUR POPULATION. I HOPE THIS CONTINUES. WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO MEET I HEARD IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG WHILE SINCE WE'VE HAD THIS AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU CHAIRMAN RAMOSE. FOR RESURRECTING THIS. BUT LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP GOING FORWARD KEEP THE BALL ROLLING. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE A MIS DESTINY DURO. HELLO ONE TO COME TALK TODAY ABOUT EPIDEMIC THAT'S BEEN CLOUDING OUR PEOPLE FOR MANY DECADES. BUT NOW IT'S ONLY COME INTO ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE GIVEN US THIS POP FORM THANKFULLY. GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE GOING MISSING AND MURDERED ALARMING RATES URBAN INDIAN HEALTH INSTITUTION DID A SURVEY OF SEVENTY ONE CITIES DISCOVER DIAL THE CITY'S FIVE HUNDRED SIX CASES FELL UNDER. THE STATUS A MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT WERE CASES FILED UNDER MISSING TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY WERE CASES FILED AS MURDERED. AND NINETY EIGHT CASES HAD UNKNOWN STATUS. THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE WOMAN IN THESE CASES WERE TWENTY NINE. I HATE THAT WE HAVE TO. THAT THESE PEOPLE GOING HOME NAMES THERE JUST NUMBERS IT'S OF SIGNING. CRITICS THE SPEAKER. OKAY THIS RATE AND COST OF. THIS REPORT WAS ONLY DONE FOR SEVENTY ONE TRIBES OF WHICH MEANS THAT THE RATES IN CASES CAN BE TREMENDOUSLY HIGHER THAN MORE AND MORE ISOLATED TRIBES WHICH IT'S MAKING IT HARDER TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF THIS TOPIC. ESPECIALLY WHEN NEITHER THE FBI NOR STATE ARE WILLING TO HELP OUR REPORT THESE CASES. WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO A WOMAN WHOSE BROTHER WAS MISSING SHE RELATE THAT THE FBI OR THE STATE DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE FBI SAID IT WASN'T THERE JURISDICTION IN THE STATES AT THE SAME NEITHER ONE COMMUNICATING WITH ANOTHER. BOTH DEPARTMENTS WERE TELLING HER TO TELL THE OTHER BOTH CLAIMING THEY COULD NOT HELP GRATEFULLY SHE- KNEW HER WAY AROUND THE LAW AND FINALLY GOT THE FBI TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER LEFT ONE WELL IT MIGHT HAVE NOT BEEN A WOMAN THIS IS THE TROUBLES NATIVE FAMILIES FACE WHEN REPORTING A CRIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THERE AND I SPEAK WILL BE AND A BALLOT FOR NOW. THE TROUBLES IN THESE SITUATIONS THAT NAY THE FAMILIES FACE A SHOULD BE HANDLED PROPERLY BY THE FBI. REPORTING LOVED ONES MISSING THEY SHOULD HAVE NOT GOTTEN TO THE POINT THE FBI SHOULD HAVE HANDLED THIS PROPERLY FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE NOT NOT EVERY FAMILY KNOWS WHO TO CALL. AND THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD BE HELPING YOU DON'T. AND NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE STRESS OF THAT THEY'RE ALREADY MOURNING THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONES AND NOW THEY HAVE. TO GO THROUGH MORE PAIN WHILE DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT. GOING TO HELP THEM. THAT THEY MUST. THAT THEY MUST DEAL WITH IT THEMSELVES THIS IS STRAIGHT OUT AND HUMANE TO TELL SOMEONE THIS IS NOT OUR JURISDICTION WE CAN DO ANYTHING ONE ACTUALLY IS THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND THEY SHOULD DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE ARE PEOPLE OF THE US AND OUR RIGHTS AS PEOPLE ARE THE SAME AS ANYONE ELSE'S. WE PLAYED WITH THEIR LISTEN TO US OUR SISTERS ARE BEING TAKEN AND KILLED AND NO ONE IS TURNING IN HI. IF IT WAS HAPPENING IN YOUR COMMUNITY OR TO YOUR RICH RELATIVE. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL WHEN THE COPS SAY THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU. WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN PAIN. FEELING CONFUSED AND BETRAYED THINK ABOUT THAT. NO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ANNABELLA HERNANDEZ RAVEN COST US AND DESTINY DURO. BRING IN THE MESSAGE FULL CIRCLE THAT IT'S A IT'S A TOPIC THAT'S FACING INDIAN COUNTRY OVER THE YEARS BUT IS DEEPLY AFFECTING OUR OUR YOUNGER FEMALE MEMBERS I'M INNER SO THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD I THANK YOU LAURIE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE. UP. TO THE FOREFRONT ADVOCACY THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE DO HAVE SOME. WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE DID MOVE FORWARD A RESOLUTION THAT CAUGHT ON MAY AS MISSING AMER INDIGENOUS WOMEN MONTH WHICH WILL BE REOCCURRING. WE ALSO HAVE A RESOLUTION JOINT RESOLUTION JOINT RESOLUTION SEVENTEEN. THAT CALLS ON THE STATE TO START TO COLLECT DATA. ON THE MISSING HAMMER INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH THROUGH THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER SIX YES ON THE LIST AND THAT IS STILL MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT BRINGING. THESE ADVOCACY IN THE TEST WAS UP FOR LEGISLATORS TO HEAR ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE. IT IS VITAL AND MAKING SURE THAT THE MESSAGE CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD THAT IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND WE FIND THE ARE GETTING. TRACTION ON THE ADVOCACY IN THE VOICE TO GET SOME TYPE OF MOVEMENT CIRCLE AROUND AND BRING IN RESOLVE TO THIS ON JURISDICTIONAL DIVIDES WHO HAS THE INVESTIGATIVE A THORNY ON THEIR- RIGHT THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT NOW WE CAN GO BACK AND START TO. LOOK AT IS THERE ANY. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANNA THANK YOU FOR. A SEVEN IS COMMITTEE AND BRING US STUFF FOR THIS ISSUE. I SUPPORT A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. WHICH WOULD ESTABLISHED OF THE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS. WOMAN TASK FORCE THIS TASK FORCE WITH THIS CLUB LAYERED COLLABORATED. WITH CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN TRIBES TO ENSURE RESOURCES. ARE USED EFFECTIVELY TO INVESTIGATE CASES OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PERSONS IN THE STATE. THIS BILL WAS HELD IN COMMITTEE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. FOR MISS GONZALEZ. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT ABOUT BETTER INTERAGENCY COOPERATION. EVEN IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. I'M I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP PUBLICIZING IT YOU TURN THE HEAT UP ON SOMETHING YOU GET RESULTS IT COMES TO A BOIL. WE KEEP DOING THAT THE GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATIONS NGUYEN WE NEED YOUR HELP AND WILL WORK WITH YOU. IN FACT I DID LEAVE JUST SO YOU KNOW I LEFT COPIES OF THIS REPORT WITH YOUR OFFICE. BUT IT'S BEEN UPDATED IN JULY. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT FOR NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN. OUR MURDER RATE IS TEN TIMES THAT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND THE AGE IS. AVERAGING JUST TWENTY FOUR THEY'RE KIND OF INFORMATION WE KEEP GETTING IT OUT THAT OUT THERE. IT'S GOING TO SPUR SPUR THOSE AGENCIES FORWARD WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER. AND I WOULD SAY WITH OUR OF THE LOCAL WALK THAT WE DO A VALID CAM MEANING BUTTERFLY IN MY LANGUAGE. IT'S GROWING AND I'M SEEING MORE TRIBAL LEADERS THERE. CHAIRMAN BRINGING THEIR FAMILIES THEIR YOUNG DAUGHTERS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM AWARE. COM I'D LOVE TO SEE ALL OF YOU THERE. PUT ON YOUR WALKING SHOES. I'M SIXTY ALMOST SIXTY FOUR. I WANT YOU TO KEEP UP WITH ME ARE YOU DON'T LOOK AT. IT IN A MORE IMPORTANTLY HAS CALIFORNIA PROVIDE TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH BETTER TRAINING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES THAT'S REALLY BIG ISSUE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THINK ABOUT HOMICIDES IT'S THE WAY YOU GET BETTER AT INVESTIGATING HOMICIDES BY GETTING THE REPS AND. YOU KNOW COMING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THE MORE YOU INVESTIGATE. THE MORE DEPTH CHART IT'S SOLVING THESE CASES AND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. MISSING PERSON CASES ARE VERY TOUGH CASES I WAS A SPOKESMAN FOR FOUR YEARS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SO. WE LAW CASES DURING THAT TIME AND TO BE HONEST THERE'S THERE MISSED GIVES A VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE- LESSER EXTINGUISHED CIRCUMSTANCES LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT LUNCH A SEARCH FOR ANYBODY OBVIOUSLY THAT. DRAWS A LOT OF RESOURCES WAS REALLY TOUGH TO DEAL WITH SO HOW CAN WE BETTER. HELP TRAIN OF FOLKS IN INDIAN COUNTRY TO DEAL WITH THESE CASES. AND HAVE A VESTED IN. I THINK THAT THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES NEED TO WORK WITH THE TRIBAL SECURITIES WE ARE A APPEAL TO EIGHTY STATE I KNOW THAT FOR MY TRIBE. WE'RE BLESSED WITH GAMING AND SO WE PAY FOR TWO ADDITIONAL. THE SHERIFF'S FOR OUR AREA BECAUSE WORLD I MEAN LET'S FACE IT MOST RESERVATIONS. AROUND AM IN THE BERNESE RIGHT WHERE I LIVE. IT ARE THE CLOSEST TOWN IS THE UNINCORPORATED TOWN OF VALLEY CENTER THE SHERIFF'S STATION SHUTS DOWN. IN THE IT'S CLOSED IN THE EVENING SO WHEN YOU CALL NINE ONE ONE IN YOUR GETTING AN OFFICE IN SAN DIEGO. WELL THAT'S A LONG WAY OFF. SO I THINK WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT. NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO TO WORK WITH THE TRIBES RIGHT NOW OUR OUR TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS OBSERVING REPORT. BUT WE NEED MORE TRAINING SO WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE OURSELVES. AND THAT MEANS WORKING WITH THE US LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU A SO MEMBER COOPER AS SOMETHING WOMAN COULD YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I JUST WANNA. SAY TO DESTINY RAVEN AND ANNABELLA THAT YOUR VOICES ARE SO CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT TO COME HERE TO THE STATE CAPITOL TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

OUR NEXT. PANEL UNDER THE ISSUES IMPACTING CALIFORNIA AMERICAN TRIBES IS THE STATUS OF TRAVEL YOUTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND WITH US TODAY AND WILL BE SPEAKING TO THIS TOPIC WILL BE DEVON LLAMA ESTABA CHIEF JUDGE OF INTER TRIBAL COURT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND MISS TEMAS ALE NO MY **** FROM THE IT BY NATION OF SANTA IS ABOUT. HOW CAN A GOOD MORNING ASK FOR YOUR INDULGENCE FOR THOSE YOU THAT HER TO SPEAK THIS MORNING WILL BE A LITTLE BIT REPETITIVE BUT WITH ALL THESE WONDERFUL SPEAKERS BEFORE US WE HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD IN AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. GET MY NAME'S IVANA MAIS Và I'M FROM THE NATION OF SANTA ISABEL I AM CURRENTLY THE CHIEF JUDGE OF THE INTER TRIBAL COURT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE SERVE OVER A DOZEN FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER TRIBES AND INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THIS ON SUBJECT MATTER BASIS. ON. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN COUNTRY AND AGAIN WHEN I THINK. ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN. AFFAIRS FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THE LEADERSHIP YOU'RE SHOWING IN SUPPORTING. THE VITAL PROGRAMS FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND THAT ARE STILL NEEDED IN INDIAN COUNTRY. ON THE U. THREE INVESTMENT GRANT TRIBAL YOUTH DIVERSION PROGRAM IS A WONDERFUL ADDITION. TO THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THESE ONGOING ISSUES IN JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WE'RE SO VERY EXCITED AS THE COURT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT AND SUPPORT THE OTHER TRIBAL COURTS IN THE STATE. ON THAT ARE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO. BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPORT THAT THAT WILL BRING TO THE STATE AND TO OUR TRIED. ON THE NEED FOR ACTION IN ADDRESSING THE ENDEMIC ISSUES FACING THE NATIVE YOUTH OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOT NEW AND THEY IN FACT HAVE EXISTED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN IS NOT A KNOWN HOWEVER OFTEN IGNORED IGNORED BY OUR OWN GOVERNMENT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND OUR OWN NATIVE PEOPLE AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT ARE REAL PAIN AND REAL ISSUES AND IF WE DO NOTHING. IF WE STAND BY WE ARE PERPETUAL THE LOSS OF OUR NATIVE YOUTH WHO ARE THE FUTURE LEADERS OF OUR TRIBAL NATIONS ON MANY PEOPLE MAKE THAT STATEMENT BUT FOR US WITH OUR TRIBAL NATIONS IN SUCH LOW NUMBERS IT IT IS IN FACT THE TRUTH THAT YOU THEY ARE OUR FUTURE LEADERS AND THEY ARE THE ONES. THAT WE NEED TO COME BACK AT. IN OUR COMMUNITY TO OFFER EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFER WE NEED ARE USED TO BE EDUCATED WHETHER IT'S IN THE TRADITIONAL WESTERN EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND THEY BECOME PROFESSIONALS OR WHETHER THEY'RE EDUCATION IS IN THE CULTURAL SENSE IN THE MEDICINAL SENSE OF THE WAYS THAT THAT WE'VE LIVED AS NATIVE PEOPLE FOR SO LONG. SO WE NEED THEM TO BE LEADERS AND ALL OF THESE AREAS AND THEY CAN'T DO THAT. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED AND HAVING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO. LIFT UP THE YOUTH THAT ARE AND SO SUCH A POSITION THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON NEEDING THAT HELP AND NOT THE PUNISHMENT. ON GROWING UP I WAS EXPOSED TO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NATIVE YOUTH WERE AND I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY LUCKY I CAME FROM A FAMILY THAT HAD LOTS A LOVE AND CARED FOR US BUT THERE WERE ALSO ALL THOSE THINGS THAT SURROUNDED US THAT WE CAN EITHER YOU CAN EITHER GET OUT YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM JOIN THEM. AND. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LOOKING BACK THERE WERE MANY THINGS I WAS EXPOSED TO AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE JUVENILE DELINQUENCY PREMATURE DEATH AMONG OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER THINGS THAT I GREW UP WITH NOT REALIZING HOW AND HEALTHY THEY WERE. AND MAKING A POINT IN MY OWN FAMILY IN MY OWN COMMUNITIES TO SEE THAT WE DO SOMETHING WE SEE THAT AND WE DON'T IDLY SIT BY. THE THINGS THAT. WE'VE GROWN UP WITH ALSO INCLUDING THE INHERENT RACISM IN OUR SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENTS THAT COME THROUGH SOMETIMES SUBTLY SUCH AS CULTURALLY IN IT IN A SENSITIVE EVENTS THE MAKING MISSIONS OUT OF SUGAR CUBES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT LOWER THE SELF ESTEEM OF OUR NATIVE YOUTH THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS THAT HAVE PICTURES OF CARTOON LIKE NATIVES THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT CONSTANTLY. MAKE OUR NATIVE CHILDREN FEEL LIKE THEIR LESSER THAN THEY ARE AND THAT THEY HAVE A HISTORY THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. COMPLAINING TO THE SCHOOL AND THEN I HAVE TO ADMIT I GO TO THE SCHOOL PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE OFTEN THAN SOME PARENTS IT MAY SEEM TRIVIAL. BUT AS THE AS THE NATIVE YOUTH GOING UP IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS I WENT TO OVER SEVEN SCHOOLS GROWING UP WE MOVED WAY TOO MUCH. THOSE THINGS ADD UP AND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON YOU BEGIN TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT YOUR HISTORY AND YOU BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEM. THOSE TYPES OF. UP PRACTICES AND CURRICULUM. LEAD TO LOW SELF ESTEEM. WHICH LEADS TO PEOPLE BEING ANGRY AND VIOLENT. WHICH LEADS TO DESPERATION AND DEPRESSION. AND THEN DRUG ABUSE AND EVENTUALLY YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEN EVENTUALLY TO PRESENT. ON. AND THAT'S JUST A PATH THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES ALL TOO OFTEN AND THAT THIS IS A WAY TO PREVENT THAT FROM THE BEGINNING TO GET IN THERE THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT KID. GOES AND TAX AT THE TRAVEL OFFICE MAYBE THEY'RE ONLY TEN YEARS OLD SAY THEY'RE JUST KIDS BEING KIDS WELL YEAH SOMETIMES BUT THAT TEN YEAR OLD WAS ALSO MY BROTHER. WHO DECIDED IT WOULD BE FINE AT TEN YEARS OLD TO GO TAG AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. ON AND HE WAS ARRESTED AT TEN YEARS OLD. BACK THEN. IN IN THE MID EIGHTIES. I WAS NO EXPERT ON JUVENILE JUSTICE THEN BUT I DO KNOW THAT. THERE WASN'T A DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT THEY SENT THEM TO THEY ARRESTED THEM AND THE COPS CAME KNOCKED ON THE DOOR BUT THE KID. ON THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO NATIVE DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND SO. AND THAT LED MY BROTHER ON THE PATH THEY JUST PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED. ON AND MY BROTHER AND FORTUNATELY WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT TO ADD DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. AND WHILE DURING HIS LIFETIME HE HE DID A LOT FOR THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT HE WAS HERE HE WAS A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR NATIVE LANGUAGE A VIOLATION REVITALIZATION PROGRAMS HE WAS GREAT YOUNG PLAYER WHICH IS OUR TRADITIONAL NATIVE HAND GAME AND HE TAUGHT MANY MANY OF OUR YOUTH. ON OUR RESERVATION AND BEYOND. ON BUT BUT THOSE THOSE INTERGENERATIONAL SICKNESSES THAT FOLLOW US ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE LOVE AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE CULTURE. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM TO ALSO EMBRACE AND SUPPORT THAT. IN THAT SYSTEM RIPS YOU AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS THAT ARE POSITIVE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ANYWHERE BUT WHERE HE UNFORTUNATELY DID. ON AND I SEE THESE YOUTH EVERY WEEK COME THROUGH MY COURT I STILL AM A PRACTICING INDIAN LAW ATTORNEY AND I DO A LOT OF CHILD ABUSE CASES AND I SEE THESE KIDS COME IN AND I JUST SEE THE FACES OF SO MANY BEFORE THEM AND I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE HEADED. IF WE DON'T SOMETHING. ON UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEMS THAT WE WORK IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AS WELL. AS THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE NOT EQUIPPED. AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT THE TRIBE COULD PROVIDE. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE TRIBAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE TRIBE KNOWS IT'S COMMUNITY. THE TRIBE KNOWS THE CULTURE AND WE HAVE THE TOOLS THAT ARE BEST SUITED FOR ARE YOU. RIGHT NOW THERE'S MANY MANY TRIBAL COURTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE EMBARKING ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN. ON IT'S NOT NEW BUT IT CERTAINLY TAKING OFF MORE AND MORE YOU SEE MANY HIGH SCHOOLS PUTTING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS TOGETHER WHERE KIDS DON'T GET AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED ANYMORE THERE'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE WOULD CALL A TALKING CIRCLE OR A PEACEMAKING GROUP. FOR EVERYBODY SITS IN A CIRCLE IT'S NOT DIFFICULT AND IT'S WAY CHEAPER. COME IN AND JUST TO BRING THE PARENTS AND THE PRINCIPAL EVERYBODY HAS TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND TALK ABOUT WHY THEY DID THIS AND I SAW THIS EXAMPLE OF THESE TWO GIRLS. THAT JUST YOU KNOW. AT LEAST THOUGHT THEY HATED EACH OTHER WALKING BY CURSE WORDS EVEN SHE GOT INTO FIGHTS. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY SIT DOWN THE CIVIL HOW DID YOU GUYS LIKE EACH OTHER WELL I HEARD SHE CALLED ME A NAME. AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL IT WAS. AND BY THE END OF THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW TALKING CIRCLE TYPE PROCESS THE GIRLS WERE LIKE THIS IS THIS IS STUPID WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING. ON AND THEY WERE ABLE TO JUST PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BEST FRIENDS BUT THEY CAN CO EXIST AT SCHOOL WITHOUT THOSE TYPES OF. INTERFERENCES AND THAT'S EXACT TYPE THINGS WE WANT TO DO. ON ONE OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM ONE OF THE TRIBES THAT'S INTERESTED IN THE PILOT THAT THE INTER TRIBAL COURT IS PUTTING TOGETHER. SHARE THIS STORY WITH ME. ON IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE SADLY THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHTING ALSO. INFIGHTING BETWEEN THE NATIVE STUDENTS AND A LOT OF THAT GOES BACK TO THEIR OWN IDENTITY. IT GOES BACK TO HAVING TO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY IS A NATIVE PERSON AND MAYBE NOT LOOKING THAT WAY. ON YOUR TO LIGHT YOUR TOO DARK WELL YOUR PARENTS ARE ARE MEXICAN AMERICAN KNOW YOUR PARENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ARE THINGS THAT WE AS TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TRIBAL LEADERS NEED TO STOP. AND THAT WE NEED TO EMBRACE ALL OF OUR OUR NATIVE YOUTH AND IN ALL OF OUR YOU. SO THESE GIRLS HAD THAT SAME KIND OF A SITUATION. AND THEY GOT IN A REALLY BAD FIGHT AT SCHOOL SAID THEY CALLED IN THE PARENTS. AND WHEN EVERYBODY GOT THEIR THE PARENTS WERE LIKE. WHAT DO YOU GUYS DOING HERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THEY THEIR FAMILY. THE GIRLS HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE FAMILY. ON AND SO WHAT THE TRIBE DID. AS THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN THIS COMES UP WE'RE GONNA MAKE ALL OF OUR YOUTH. ON. SIT DOWN AND LOOK AT THEIR FAMILY TREE AND THEY BRING IN THE ENROLLMENT DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE AND THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY SAY YOU'RE GOING TO FILL OUT YOUR FAMILY TREE AND THEY ALL FIND OUT OH MY GOSH I'M RELATED TO HER AND RELATED TO HIM AND THAT'S A GOOD. THING TO KNOW FOR OTHER REASONS. SO. IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM. IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE VERY VERY SMALL AND I TELL MY OWN CHILDREN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE COUSINS ON PRETTY MUCH EVERY RESERVATION IN SAN DIEGO SO JUST REMEMBER THAT. AND KNOW WHO YOUR FAMILY IS AND SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PRACTICAL THINGS BUT THINGS THAT THAT COME FROM JUST. THAT THE ESSENCE OF BEING WHO WE ARE THEY CAN DO SO MUCH TO PREVENT THE PATH THAT WE SEE SO MANY OF OUR YOUTH. GOING DOWN. RIGHT NOW THE INTER TRIBAL COURT IS EMBARKING ON A HEALING TO WELLNESS PROJECT WHERE WERE DEVELOPING A YOUTH PEER COURT. WE VISITED SEVERAL MODELS FROM LA TO RIVERSIDE TO ONES THAT WE SAW ON OTHER STATES AND WE REALLY LIKE TO THE YOUTH CARE COURT MODEL BECAUSE IT LETS YOU HOLD THEIR FELLOW YOUTH ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES THE YOUTH PARTICIPATING AT THE COULD SAY THE PIER JURY ON TO LEARN ABOUT THE COURT SYSTEM IN A WAY WHERE IT'S NOT ADVERSARIAL WHERE THEY'RE NOT COMING IN WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE BUT THEY'RE THERE TO BE PROACTIVE AND TO DO SOMETHING. TO SUPPORT THEIR THEIR FELLOW YOU. SO WE ARE EMBARKING ON THIS PILOT WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY TWO TRIBES THAT ARE INTERESTED WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE THAT ARE ALREADY DOING DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS WITH WELLNESS PLANS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BRING THIS ALL TOGETHER SO THAT NGUYEN TRIBAL POLICE SITE. THE JUVENILES INTO OUR COURT FOR. BASICALLY STATUS OFFENSES THE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES THAT THE COURT WILL DIVERT THEM INTO THIS YOUTH PEER COURT WHERE WE WILL. ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE THEM TO ADMIT GUILT TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE WHEN I CALL MORE PERSPECTIVE CONSEQUENCES THEN HAVING THAT ON THERE THEIR TRIBAL COURT RECORD ON AND HAVING JUST FACING LARGE FINES THAT ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM SO WE'RE GONNA DO THINGS SUCH AS COMMUNITY SERVICE CULTURAL PROGRAMS. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO COME BACK AND SERVE ON THE PIER JURY AND THAT'S A MODEL THAT RIVERSIDE COUNTY DID THAT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH. AND WHEN WE WERE THERE. ON SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY THE OFFENDERS AND HAD CAME BACK YOU KNOW THEY WERE THE ONES RIGHT UP THERE IN THE FACE OF THE OFFENDERS ASKING QUESTIONS AND SAYING DIDN'T YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY WHEN YOU WERE DOING THIS. AND IT WAS REALLY NEAT TO SEE THE TURN AROUND IN IN THOSE YOUTH AND I'M I'M HOPING WE CAN REPLICATE THAT MODEL WITHIN OUR OWN. ON I COULD TALK ALL DAY ABOUT THE EXCITING THINGS THAT WE ARE WANTING TO DO. I HOPE THAT I'VE PROVIDED YOU. AND SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AND SOME THINGS THAT MANY OF THE OTHER TRIBAL COURTS HAVE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT CONTINUED SUPPORT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE MORAL SUPPORT THE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT AND OF COURSE THE FUNDING. AND THE TRIBES ARE DOING ALL AYE THEY CAN IN IN MY COURT. TO ENSURE THAT THEY LOOK AT EVERY RESOURCE. BECAUSE THIS IS TRULY FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE WE HAVE AND THAT'S OUR CHILDREN. ON A DOWN GOING TO TURN OVER TO MY HOPE PRISONER WHO'S GOING TO PROVIDE A YOUTH PERSPECTIVE. HI I AM TO REALIZE FOR A AND I'M FROM THE SENATE BUT THE SENATE IS ABOUT RESERVATIONS HAVE BEEN SAN DIEGO BUT I'M ALSO FROM THE NUMBER OF THE RESERVATION. AND HOPING. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL OF YOU HAVING ME HERE AND I HAD THIS SPEECH PLANNED OUT BUT AS I WAS READING IT I REALIZED. MUCH MORE ISSUES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SAID AND I NOTICED A LOT OF YOU WERE ASKING HOW TO HELP AND HOW. YOU GUYS CAN TAKE PART. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT NATIVES KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER THAN ANYONE WE CAN HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER THAN. ANY NON NATIVE CAN EVER AND IT'S. THE PROBLEM IS THAT AS I SAID I'M KIND OF AN ODD BALL NATIVE WHERE I LIVE OFF THE RESERVATION BUT- I A GO THERE ARE I GOT IT CULTURAL GATHERINGS ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND AND I'M UP THERE ALL THE TIME. BUT I'VE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A LACK OF MOTIVATION AMONGST ALL MY FRIENDS AND COUSINS. THEY FEEL AND WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR LIFE RIGHT NOW IS TO NORMAL FOR THEM WITH THE LACK OF MONEY. THE LACK OF THE SUPPORT FROM THEIR OWN PARENTS YOU KNOW DRIVING YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE TO DRIVE THEM TO THEIR OWN CULTURAL GATHERING THAT'S MAYBE THREE MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD. AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND MOTIVATION LIVING ON THE RESERVATION. AS THERE'S NOT REALLY THAT MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE NATIVE PEOPLE CAN THINK OF TO HELP EACH OTHER. WE'RE SO DIVIDED AND IT REALLY SHOWS AND THE GATHERINGS YOU KNOW. WHEN WE JUST HAD OUR CULTURAL GATHERING JUST NOT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BUT- I'D SEE KIDS STAYED RATHER YOU KNOW SMOKE SOME WEED AND SAID OF TAKING PART IN THEIR OWN CULTURE AND- TO BE HONEST OUR CULTURE IS WHAT WE HAVE LEFT AND WHAT KEEPS US AS A COMMUNITY TOGETHER. WE OFTEN SEE. JUST THERE'S FIGHTS AYE GATHERINGS THERE'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE DOES ABOUT A HORSESHOE THEY GET MAD AT EACH OTHER AND THEY'D GO START GETTING INTO THIS WHOLE DRAMA ABOUT THEIR FAMILY WE'RE A DIVIDED COMMUNITY AND IT'S THE TRUTH AND- AS MUCH AS I LOVE MY CULTURE AND AS MUCH AS I LEARN FROM IT IT'S NOT GOING TO HOLD US ON TO FROM TOO MUCH LONGER. AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO. HAVE YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT THESE PROBLEMS WE HAD THERE NOT JUST STORIES THAT WERE TELLING YOU THERE ARE REAL LIFE PROBLEMS AND THEY NEED TO BE SOLVED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE. WE'RE NOT NOTHING'S HAPPENING WE'RE JUST GOING DEEPER IN A HOLE THAT'S BEEN DUG FOR US OVER. THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND- IT'S REALLY NOT GETTING ANY BETTER AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS SHE'S. MY CONSIDER HER AS A REALLY CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER. BUT SHE HAS ALL THESE DREAM SHE TALKS ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE YOU KNOW SHE WANTS TO GO TO BEAUTY SCHOOL SHOWS ALL THIS. BUT SHE CAN'T EVEN GET A RIDE TO HER OWN SCHOOL LET ALONE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S GOING TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR AND I'M STARTING SCHOOL TOMORROW. AND IT'S RELEASE SICKENING BECAUSE SHE HAS TO PARENTS LIVING WITHIN MINUTES OF EACH OTHER. ON THE SAME RESERVATION BUT NEITHER THEM HOW THEIR OWN HOUSE THEY DON'T. HAVE A CAR THEY CAN'T DRIVE HER TO SCHOOL SO SHE'S OUT HERE YOU KNOW. TRYING TO FIND RIGHTS TO SCHOOL AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF MY COUSINS THEY WON'T GIVE HER A RIDE TO SCHOOL BECAUSE- THEY DON'T LIKE HER BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED MAYBE IN FIFTH GRADE. AND THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW. AND IT'S REALLY SICKENING BECAUSE- THESE KIDS ARE JUST LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THEY CAN HOLD ON TO. THEY WANT OF. LIKE A LIGHT TO TURN ON AND THEY WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN BUT THE TRUTH IS NOTHING IS HAPPENING. AND AS MUCH AS OUR CULTURE MEANS SO MUCH TO US IN AS MUCH AS IT YOU KNOW. IT'S WHO WE ARE IT'S NOT SOLVING ANYTHING REALLY AND. IT'S THESE GANG MENTALITIES AND THESE YOU KNOW LIFE OF HATRED THAT WERE HOLDING ON TO BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY THERE'S NOT MUCH AND I'M REALLY BLESSED THAT I WAS GROWING UP IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ENCOURAGE COLLEGE IN THE ENCOURAGE HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT IT YOU CAN HAVE. A TRIBE CAN HAVE A CASINO THEY CAN HAVE ALL OF THAT BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THOSE GANG MENTALITY STAY THERE AND THEY INFLUENCE OUR KIDS AND OUR PARENTS WERE INFLUENCE THE EXACT SAME WAY. THEY'RE NOT AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE HAVE. SO I'M KIND OF GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S THE OUR USES OUR FUTURE LEADERS AND OUR USER AS THEIR SO UNMOTIVATED BUT THE TRUTH IS IT'S NOT JUST OUR YOUTH THAT NEEDS HELP IT'S ARE ADULTS THAT NEED HELP AND IT'S OUR ELDERS THAT NEED HELP ALSO WE WERE ALL CONFUSED AND WE'RE ALL DIVIDED AMONGST EACH OTHER AND OUR PARENTS BECAUSE HATE BETWEEN EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES AND WE GET INFLUENCED IF OUR PARENTS SAY THEY DON'T LIKE SOMEONE THE KIDS DON'T LIKE SOMEONE IT'S NOT JUST THE USE THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO ITS EVERYONE AND WE NEED TO. HEAL OUR BROKEN COMMUNITIES AND JUST AS. WE NEED TO CALL ATTENTION AND PUBLICITY IS A- THE REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO GO FOR THIS SITUATION BECAUSE. WE AREN'T SEEN AS YOU KNOW OUR CULTURE IS KIND OF OUR. I DON'T KNOW THIS IS OUR GUESTS SCREENSAVER AND AWAY THEY PEOPLE LOOK AT US YOU WEAR FEATHERS AND YOU DO ALL THIS STUFF BECAUSE I GO TO A SCHOOL WHERE THERE'S ONLY ABOUT SIX NATIVE SECOND OR SCHOOL AND THERE'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND KIDS THAT GO THERE. AND YOU KNOW I REMEMBER I HAD A MATH ASSIGNMENT AND IT WAS OF COURSE ABOUT IT WHAT DID THE NATIVE CEDA SOME GUY OR WHATEVER AND HE HAD A LIKE A BUCKET ON HIS HEAD OR SOMETHING. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY DISGUSTING SCENE YOU KNOW JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS LIKE IT'S OKAY YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST WERE NOT SEEN AS THE BROKEN COMMUNITIES WERE SEEN AS- KIND OF CIRCUITS TO LAUGH OUT OR WERE SEEN AS YOU KNOW JUST FEATHERS AND WE WRITE ON HORSES WHICH. COURSE ISN'T REALLY FROM HERE ANYWAYS SO. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY CONCENTRATE ON OUR YOUTH BUT ONCE WORD FIGURING OUT A WAY TO HELP THEM LET'S HELP THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AND HELP IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE THERE'S STILL AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND I THINK. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. WE SIR ADDRESSING THESE NOW BECAUSE- TO BE HONEST OUT OF ALL MY COUSINS AND FRIENDS I THINK THAT ME AND MY BROTHER ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT. REALLY WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT WILL STICK TO OUR WORD. THANK YOU HE A HEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY. UP IN BRINGING THE SOME MUCH NEEDED DIALOGUE. TO THE FOREFRONT HERE IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND FROM THE LEGISLATORS THAT ARE HERE. IS THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE ONLY WOMAN GONZALEZ. HI MOM MOM AND SO I JUST THOUGHT OF A LOT OF KIDS YOU ARE SO WELL SPOKEN AND YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR SHARING. YOUR STORY WITH US AND REMINDING US I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID AS YOU KNOW TRY CAN HAVE A CASINO DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS RIGHT. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND. HAVING FINANCIAL RESOURCES IS BETTER THAN NOT HAVING THEM BUT THERE ARE SO MANY DEEP ROOTED ISSUES BECAUSE BY GENERATIONS OF. OPPRESSION AND SYSTEMATIC YOU KNOW MIGRATION AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BUT YOU BRING A FRESH PERSPECTIVE TO THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS IN THE PANELS THAT WERE HERE AND TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME IN HERE THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACING CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE.

ULTIMATELY MARCHING ORDERS OF WHAT CAN WE DO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE SONA THANK YOU AT THIS TIME I WANT TO GO TO IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OUT THERE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE POLITICS READ ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE CHIANG GAN COLUSA TRIBES. REAL QUICKLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN RAMOSE FOR GOING TO THE SPEAKER AND ASKING FOR THE COMMITTEE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME AND WAITING. FOR ALL THE MEMBERS WHO WANTED TO JOIN THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF IT. AS YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TRIBES HAVEL A LOT MORE ISSUES THAN JUST GAMING WHICH USUALLY HEAR A LOT OF THE LOBBYISTS ON. I'M I WAS GOING TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AS A COMMITTEE. OF ONE IS THE SUPPORT OF NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION. I REPRESENT A CHUNK OF FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT. ARE THEY HAD AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BUT WE AS A GROUP WENT TO THE THEN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND SAID YOU NEED TO HAVE A TRIBAL ADVISER IN THE HORSESHOE. HE DID THAT AND WE WORKED WITH THE VERY FIRST ADVISER WERE WORKING WITH THE SECOND ONE. THEY HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE AS YOU CAN SEE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION MEDIAN I WENT TO TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO. AND THEY HAD THREE STAFF. AND THAT WAS CONSIDERED A BIG STAFF AND THEY HAD TONS OF THINGS TO DO. SO IS AS THIS COMMITTEE PROGRESSES IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU ALSO HELPED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO MAKE SURE. THEY HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES NOW BUT THEY STILL HAVE A FULL PLATE. AND CRISTINA SNYDER CAN'T DO IT ALL ON HER OWN SHE NEEDS HAVE A LOT OF BACK UP. IN A LOT OF AREAS. COUPLE OF THEM WHEN YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF. IS AB FIFTY TWO WE FOUGHT OVER SITE LEGISLATION A COUPLE OF BILLS WENT THROUGH. INCLUDING SB EIGHTEEN WITH STEINBERG. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF LAWS AREN'T FOLLOW THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS MAYBE FIFTY TWO IS ONE OF THEM. I WOULD CAUTION ALL OF YOU AND I'LL SEND A NOTE OUT TO THE PRESS THE COMMITTEE. HOUSING STREAMLINING. YOU GOT TO KEEP IN MIND WE HAVE A BILL ON THE BOOKS AB FIFTY TWO. IT'S ON SAID SITES. NOTHING GIVES STREAMLINING HOUSING BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T GIVE AWAY THOSE SACRED SITES BY NOT LOOKING INTO EACH OF THOSE BILLS HAVING. AB FIFTY TWO LET WHICH AT THAT. AND WE'RE. WORKING WITH SOME OF THE AUTHORS AND ONE THAT. A NAG. UC IS BEEN ATROCIOUS MY ALMA MATER BERKELEY PHOEBE HEARST HAS THOUSANDS OF BODIES IN BOXES AND BAGS. THEY CRISTINA SNYDER AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION ALONG WITH LOWER MARANDA THE ACTING CHAIR OF VARIETY OF CHAIRS OF TRIBES HAVE MET WITH THE PALATINE IL THEY PUT TOGETHER THIS ADVISORY GROUP IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE STILL GETTING REPATRIATION BACK WERE MOVING THAT WAY. BUT AS AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA KNOWS AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON THOSE BILLS THE UC'S ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP THINGS THEY THINK ARE THERE. AND I GUARANTEE YOU IF IT WAS GRAHAM A GARCIA OR OR GRAMMA RUBIO IN A BOX IN A BAG IN THE BACK ROOM YOU'D HAVE A BACK OF THE TRIBES ARE NO DIFFERENT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THOSE REMAINS REPATRIATED. VERSES. ZERO CURATORS WHO CONSIDERED TO BE THERE AROUND. AND IT IN RELATION TO THE PAULA TANO THE NEW CHAIR OF THE REGENTS A PRESIDENT IS PREZ AND JOHN PRESS IT'S BEEN A HUGE FAN. OF EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING AND THE REPATRIATION. SO JUST A FEW THINGS THAT ARE NON GAMING THAT I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK.
