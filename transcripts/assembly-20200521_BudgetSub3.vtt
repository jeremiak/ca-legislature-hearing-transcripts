00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.052
OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:43.154
ON THESE ISSUES THIS IS

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.156
DEFINITELY NOT AN IDEAL

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:48.493
SITUATION AND SO I WOULD WANT

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.161

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.397
CONTINUE TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:54.399
OUTSIDE OF THE HEARING PROCESS

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.167
BY SENDING EMAILS AND

00:33:56.234 --> 00:34:00.671
CONTACTING US AND- OTHER WAYS-

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:04.475

YOUR CONCERNS AND YOUR OPINIONS.

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.379
NOW I'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.381
AND CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:11.682
BEING PROPOSED FOR RESOURCES IN

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.851
THE MAY REVISION AND I'M SURE

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:16.954
OTHERS TO TWO. OF I UNDERSTAND

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.791
TOUGH SIX RP DID I THINK WE ALL.

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:22.727
AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO. PLUS BUT

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.595
THERE ARE MANY INCONSISTENCIES

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.631
THAT I FIND CONCERNING FOR

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.366
EXAMPLE THERE ARE PROPOSED

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.368
ONGOING BASELINE REDUCTIONS

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:32.170
ALONG PROGRAM ALONGSIDE PROGRAM

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:35.173
EXPANSIONS. I'M ALSO CONCERNED

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.207
WITH THE ROLLBACK OF THE

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.543
HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND WHICH

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:39.644
AIR MARKS THIRTY MILLION

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.380
DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A VARIETY

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.515
OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THE

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.517
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.919
SHIFT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.454
MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.589
BASIS FROM THE WILD CONSERVE IT

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.192
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:55.493
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.663
WILDLIFE. AND WHILE I-

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:02.200
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT- DFW

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.569
NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TAKING

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.904
FROM ANOTHER SISTER AGENCY

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:09.307
CONDUCTING COMPLIMENTARY WORK

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.342
IS IN MY OPINION NOT THE RIGHT

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.644
APPROACH AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:15.112
THE EXT OF THE HABITAT

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.547
CONSERVATION. WHAT'S THE

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:18.950
NEGOTIATED BUDGET DEAL FROM

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:22.286
ONLY A YEAR AGO. THIS PROPOSAL

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.689
WOULD BASICALLY UNDO THAT DEAL

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:29.360
AND THE AT IT JUST SEEMS SO ODD

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.028
TO ME THAT IT THIS IS NOT THE

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:34.165
WAY WE SHOULD BE OPERATING-

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:36.367
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:38.236
THE LEGISLATURE IF WE CUT A

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:41.272
DEAL. AT A MINIMUM IF THE

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:42.740
ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT THERE

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.408
NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE TO A DEAL

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.445
THAT WAS JUST CUT LAST YEAR. I

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:48.946
WOULD THINK THAT THE BETTER

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:49.814
APPROACH WOULD BE TO COME TO

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:51.682
THE LEGISLATURE- THROUGH THE

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:53.651
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. AND

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.187
DISCUSS THAT AND SEE IF THERE

00:35:56.254 --> 00:36:01.058
ISN'T. A BETTER WAY- OTHERWISE

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:05.162
WHY ARE WE MAKING DEALS. SO I

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:07.164
AM ALSO VERY FRUSTRATED WITH-

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:10.301
MANY TRANSFERS- TO OFFSET THE

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:12.103
USE OF THE GENERAL FUND. MOST

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:14.205
NOTABLY- THERE'S A TRANSFER OF

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.540
NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.441
AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. I'M

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.110
CONCERNED THAT THESE FUNCHESS

00:36:19.176 --> 00:36:20.811
WILL HAVE AN OVERALL REGRESSIVE

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:22.446
IMPACT ON ALL OF OUR

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.482
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.751
EFFORTS. HOWEVER TO ENSURE

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:27.852
ADEQUATE TIME FOR PUBLIC

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:31.722
COMMENT- I'M NOT CONNECT- ASK

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.391
THE QUESTIONS AT ALL WITH HOLD

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:36.861
ANY OTHER COMMENTS AND DISCUSS-

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.362
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:41.265
DEPARTMENTS OFFLINE. ON THE

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:42.300
WHOLE I THINK GIVEN THE

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:45.570
CIRCUMSTANCES THE- THE-

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.305

SCENARIO- AND HAVE DONE A

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.679
REASONABLY GOOD JOB IN DOING

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:57.014
SO- GIVEN A VERY VERY SHORT

00:36:57.081 --> 00:37:01.085
PERIOD OF TIME AND THE- REALLY

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:03.054

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.292

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.249
CHOICES TO MAKE AND I JUST HOPE

TO BE THINKING ABOUT EQUITY.

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:47.324
ALONG THAT WAY AND WHAT THAT

WHAT THAT MEANS OUR CLEAN AIR.

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.715

LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT

EXCESSIVELY HOT SUMMER- I HAVE

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:50.107
CONCERNS. ABOUT INCREASE STATS

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:52.476
BECAUSE PEOPLE- FINANCIALLY

MONEY THEY ARE BEING AFFECTED

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:06.323
BY THE PRICE. AND I THINK. STAY

HOME SO I THINK SOME. WE COULD

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.227
BE MAKING FOR DISADVANTAGED

OKAY. THIS IS A HIGH LOW

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.869
OVERVIEW OF THE MAY REVIEW FOR

TO REACHED AGE. RELATIVE TO THE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.808
JANUARY BUDGET PROVIDES FOR THE

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:11.942
THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OVERVIEW

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.844
AND I THINK THAT YOU KEY TAKE

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.679
AWAYS FOR THE COMMITTEE THE

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:16.947
FIRST IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:18.582
YOUR LOCATION SPENDING IT IS

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:20.584
DOWN OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.252
IN THE MAY REVISION RELATIVE TO

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.655
JANUARY. THIS IS LARGER THAN BY

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:27.958
A REDUCTION IN PROJECTED. IN

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:29.693
PROJECTED- TRANSPORTATION

REVENUES FROM DIESEL SALES TAX

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:35.833
AND- EXCISE GASOLINE TAXES THIS

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.868
PRIMARILY AFFECTS TO PROGRAMS

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.736
THAT OUR FORMULA FUNDED FOR

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:42.406
LOCAL AGENCIES. THAT IS THE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.273
STATE TRANSIT ASSISTANCE

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.076
PROGRAM AND THE LOCAL STREETS

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.978
AND ROADS PROGRAM. THE SECOND

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:50.013
MAJOR TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAGE

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.048
IS THAT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:54.017
OTHER AGENCIES THE LEVEL OF

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.453
SPENDING IS NOT DRAMATICALLY

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.422
DIFFERENT ON NET FROM THE

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.623
JANUARY BUDGET HOWEVER

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:02.059
UNDERLYING ALL OF THAT IS A

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.361
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.762
ADJUSTMENTS BOTH MOSTLY

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.531
DOWNWARD BUT ALSO SOME UPWARD

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.966
AS WELL THAT THAT EACH OTHER

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.901
OUT INTO THOSE ARE WHAT ALL

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:13.537
TALK ABOUT. THE NEXT FEW. IT

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.006

BUT IF YOU DO LOOK THROUGH THE

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.090
LIST I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.224
THAT THE MAIN THEME IS THAT

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.893

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.729
CAPITAL COST FOR IMPROVEMENTS

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.631
AS WELL I'M GOING OPERATIONS

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:22.065

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:24.768
SEEMS. AT THIS POINT PRUDENT TO

BILION. IN TOTAL. AND THIS IS

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:42.886
THAT MAKE UP THE BIGGEST.

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:44.755

OF THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE- THE

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:12.376
LARGER ONE MORE THAN FIVE

ARE. COMBINATION CURRENT YEAR

IN SOME CASES NEW COST- BUT

THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE FUNDED

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:32.996
BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.664
REVENUES FROM REDUCE VISITOR

SHIP AND AN ASSOCIATE AND SHE-

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.704
AND THE INABILITY TO HOLD. AS

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:43.206
MANY EVENTS. AS WE CAN BE

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.941
REASONABLE ALTHOUGH EXACT.

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.977
ESTIMATE ARE ARE SUBJECT TO

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:49.946
SOME UNCERTAINTY. THE THIRD

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:50.614
ITEM ON THE LIST THE CALIFORNIA

PROPOSAL- THIS IS A PROPOSAL

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:56.820
FROM JANUARY- IT IS RETAIN FROM

THEN ON ALTHOUGH THE SOME OF

00:50:58.522 --> 00:50:59.990
THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.058
ARE MODIFIED. YEAH IN THIS CASE

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.560
WE SIMPLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.463
IS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THE

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.198
GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.200

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:11.334
ARE RETAINED IN THE MAYOR

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.203
VISION AND WE THINK THIS WILL

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.004
BE A TOUGH DECISION FOR THE

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.105
LEGISLATURE ON THE ONE HAND

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.307
THERE IS- I THINK A REAL

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:20.177
INTEREST IN. CONTINUING TO

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:24.114
SUPPORT WILD FIRE EFFORTS OF

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:26.817
WILDFIRE OF PROTECTION AT THE

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:29.386
SAME TIME THIS IS IT AND IN

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:30.854
ADDITION TO THAT OF COURSE

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.888
THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:32.589
COULD BE A PARTICULARLY BAD

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:35.625
FIRE YEAR HELLO PRECIPITATION

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.127
GOAL THAT'S THIS IS A LARGE

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.396
IMPORTANT. I'M GOING GROWING

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.498
PROPOSE IT RIGHT THE ENGINE

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:44.100
THEIR FIVE. IN OUT HERE IN

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:44.734
THEIR FULL YOU'LL HAVE TO WEIGH

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:51.541
THAT YOUR GENERAL FUND. HE'S

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:53.944
I'M ACTUALLY ABLE TO THE FINAL

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.178
I. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:56.680
WHILE. THIS IS A RELATIVELY SO

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.448
FOR FIRST MILLION DOLLARS IS TO

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:00.650
EMPLOYEE. HOWEVER SOME. ACTIVE

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:03.119
IN THE DEPARTMENT AND WE SIMPLY

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:04.187
NO IN THIS CASE THAT- WELL WE

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.222
DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN WITH THE

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.357
SPECIFIC ACTIVITY PROPOSED. IT

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:08.925
IS A BET ON INCONGRUOUS WITH

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:11.428
THE IDEA OF ALSO CUTTING BASED

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.697
FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AS

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.131
MENTIONED EARLIER. IF YOU TURN

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:17.534
TO PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT A

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.869
COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:19.870
BUT LOOKING AT THE OVERALL

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:22.038
GENERAL FUND ARCHITECTURE OF A

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.940
PROPOSED IN THE NEAR VISION FOR

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.876
THESE AGENCIES. OTHER PERSON

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:28.845
OVERALL WE THINK THE- NATURE OF

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.514
THE PROPOSAL A REASONABLE GIVEN

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.182
THE LOSS IN GENERAL FUND

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.684
REVENUE PROJECTED. BUT WE DO

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:35.585
NOT AGAIN THAT MOST OF THESE

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:36.987
INCLUDING THE SPECIAL FUNDS

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:40.490
LOANS TRANSFERS- AND FINE SHIPS

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:42.759
ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE AND OUR

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:43.994
OFFICE IS PROJECTING THAT THIS

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.662
WILL BE A MULTI YEAR. GENERAL

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.466
FUND- PROBLEM. BUT WITH REGARD

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:50.267
TO THE BASS LINE BECAUSE I

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.701
ALREADY NOTED THE ONE FOR FISH

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.837
AND WILDLIFE THE OTHER ONE TO

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.739
MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF IT IN

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.306
THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:58.575
RECREATION. THIS WOULD BE A

00:52:58.642 --> 00:52:59.509
THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:00.877
FUND REDUCTION BUT NOT IN THE

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.913
BUDGET YEAR PROPOSED FOR. THE

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.815
FOLLOWING YEAR IN BOTH THESE

00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:08.418
CASES WE YOU YOU MIGHT

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.352
ULTIMATELY FIND THAT THEY'RE

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:11.021
NECESSARY TO ENACT IN ORDER TO

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.355
BALANCE THE BUDGET GIVEN

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:14.457
LIMITED GENERAL FUND REVENUES.

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.692
I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN AT

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:18.161
THIS POINT WITH BOTH OF THESE-

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.030
IS THE LACK OF SORT OF SPECIFIC

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.331
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO THE

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:22.566
EMPLOYMENT AND THAT MAY BE

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:23.466
SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE WANTS

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.702
TO. CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:29.506
THE DEPARTMENT ON. ON PAGE SIX-

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:30.707
JUST ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT THE

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.776
GENERAL FUND EIGHT IS THAT WITH

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:33.977
RESPECT TO THE AUGMENTATION

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.512
PROPOSED AGAIN WE THINK THERE

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.846
ARE REASONABLE RATIONALE

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.548
PROPOSED BY THE MINISTRATION-

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:41.651
IN GENERAL FOR THE- HOWEVER.

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.553
THEY DO REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.121
SPENDING PRIORITIES AND SO WE

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.890
SIMPLY ENCOURAGE THE CANADIAN

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.825
THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.126
YOU SHARE THE SAME PRIORITIES-

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.162
GIVEN THE LIMITED GENERAL FUND

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:55.832
REVENUES AVAILABLE THIS COMING

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:57.901
YEAR. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. I

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.202
WANT HIGHLIGHT A FEW ISSUES

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.670
RELATED TO SPECIAL FUNDS AND

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.105
BOND FUNDS- THIS BECAUSE IN

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.607
FACT IN THIS PROGRAM AREA.

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.675
THOSE WHO MAKE UP MOST OF THE

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:08.578
REVENUE SOURCES FOR PROGRAMS.

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:11.581
THE FIRST ISSUE TO HIGHLIGHT IF

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:12.182
THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:15.218
PLAN AS THE COMMITTEE MAY WELL

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:16.453
NOW THE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:18.521
AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:19.723
BUDGET YEAR REVENUES ARE GOING

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.257
TO LOOK LIKE. FROM THE CAP AND

00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:23.460
TRADE OPTIONS GIVEN THE DECLINE

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:25.395
IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND REDUCE

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:28.531
DRIVING- THE MAIN REVISION

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.800
INCLUDES ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:33.069
FUNDING PLAN AS PROPOSED

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:35.138
ANYWHERE AND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.340
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:37.941
FOR THE CALL THE DISCRETIONARY

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.409
PROGRAM- HOWEVER THE NEAR

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:41.411
VISION DOES ALSO INCLUDE.

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.079
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WHICH

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:45.982
UPRIGHT CLEARLY PRIORITIZE IS

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.318
THE- PROGRAM THAT WOULD RECEIVE

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.653
FUNDING FIRST SHOULD REVENUE TO

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:53.156
BE LOWER THAN PROJECTED WE

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.191
THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IS A STEP

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.626
STRATEGY TO SET EXPLICIT

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.862
PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET- WE

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:01.231
SIMPLY NOTE THAT. THE PROGRAMS

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.133
PRIORITIZE ARE THOSE THAT ARE

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:04.367
THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.236
INSTANTLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.038
HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES-

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:10.173
BASED ON AS INTEREST AND- HOW

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.709
IT WANTS TO BALANCE- DIFFERENT-

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:15.645
POLICY GOALS SUCH AS- REDUCING

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:18.048
GHG EMISSIONS- CLIMATE

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:21.151
ADAPTATION AND- IMPROVING AIR

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:24.754

WANT TO ASK FINANCE FOR HOW

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.947
THEY'VE INTERPRETED THIS BUT-

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.983
OUR UNDERSTANDING IN TALKING TO

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.152
THEM IS THAT THE- THOUGHT IS

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.654
THAT THEIR INTEREST EARNED. ON

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:32.488
SOME OF THE FUNDS IN THE STATE

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.057
HIGHWAY ACCOUNT AND THAT THAT

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:39.796
FROM BEING USED FOR NON

TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. NOT

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.432
BEING A I'M NOT ONE TO PROP. TO

OPINE ON WHETHER THIS IS IN

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.601
FACT LEGAL OR NOT WE HAVE OUR

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:46.569
BEST UNDERSTAND IS THIS WOULD

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:47.203
BE THE FIRST TIME THIS

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.838
INTERPRETATION IS IN USE. SO

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:49.939
WE'VE GOT WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.207

WE LEARN TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF.

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.247
SO MAYBE THE QUESTION TO

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.749
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN IS

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.452

THIS OR- IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.493
TO ME THAT. WAY AND THE GAS TAX

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.061
TO BE WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT IT

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.696
WAS PRETTY CLEAR AT LEAST FROM

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.798
THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF IT

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.800
THAT THE- THE DOLLARS WOULD BE

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.836
GOING TO. ROAD PROJECTS AND

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.704
THAT. THIS PROPOSAL BY THE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.973
ADMINISTRATION. BREAKS THAT

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.008
PROMISE MADE TO THE PUBLIC THAT

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.844
HE WOULDN'T DIVERT THE GAS TAX

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.013
DOLLARS SO MAYBE DEPARTMENT.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.614
CAN I HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.283
OF FINANCE. CERTAINLY AND TO BE

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:37.320
CLEAR PROBABLY TWENTY PROTECT

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.388
THE FUEL TAX REVENUES.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:40.456
ATTRACTED A NUMBER OF

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:41.858
TRANSPORTATION RVENUES THE

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.660
ACTION BUT BUT IT'S IT PROTECTS

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.662
ACTUAL REVENUES THAT COME IN-

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.698
AND IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.800
PROTECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.501
THOSE WHILE THEY WERE IN THE

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.736
ACCOUNT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:57.273
WE'RE TRANSFERRING HRE. IT'S

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.341
YOU KNOW IF THE INTEREST STATE

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.742
IN THE- THE PHONE LONG ENOUGH

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:02.044
THAT- THEY WOULD. BE

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.246
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WITH

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.414
THESE THESE FUNDS IN PARTICULAR

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.149
I THINK WE'VE HAD A GENERAL

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.950
UNDERSTANDING INTERNALLY AT

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.953
LEAST THAT- THESE WERE NOT

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.355
SUBJECT ARTICLE NINETEEN

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.489
PROTECTIONS AND SO WHEN WE

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.459
FOUND OURSELVES IN THIS-

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.728
BROADER BUDGETARY DILEMMA-

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:22.231
SWEET. BUT THAT WE DECIDED TO

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.432
USE THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE. OKAY

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:26.102
IT SEEMS TO ME AT LEAST THAT.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.737
YOU YOU'RE VIOLATING THE SPIRIT

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:31.207
OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.209
PROTECTIONS WORD THAT. YOUR

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.677
PROTECTING THE FUNDS BUT THEN

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:35.912
ANY INTEREST EARNED OFF THAT

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.281
FUNDS YOU'RE NOW DIVERTING- IT

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:39.949
SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S NOT

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:43.519
WHAT- CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:47.423
EXPECTED OF- THE PROTECTION OF

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.925
THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT BUT

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.259
DOES THE STATE PLAN ON PAYING

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:52.228
BACK THESE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.996
AT A LATER DATE AND IF SO. WHEN

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:56.933
WOULD THAT BE. SO NOW- THE

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.902
PROPOSAL IS TO- TO TRANSFER

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.238
THESE FUNDS PERMANENTLY- THAT

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.974
FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT-

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.877
AND- IT YES. THE LA MENTIONED

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.011
THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FROM THE

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:10.146
TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF FUND

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.280
WHICH ACTUALLY WAS TRANSFERRED

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.516
FROM THE GENERAL FUND- BACK IN

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.750
THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND. SO BOTH

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:17.653
OF THOSE ARE TRANSFERS- WE DO

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.290
HAVE- ONE PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:21.891
TWO MILLION DOLLAR LOAN FROM

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.260
THE- OF INNER AERONAUTICS

FUNDING. AND THE LOCAL AIRPORT

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.798
ON ACCOUNT. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.866
THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.902
PROPOSED. PAYING BACK ANY OF

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.237
THOSE TRANSFERS FROM THE STATE

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:37.773
HIGHWAY COUNT. THAT ONCE IT'S

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.341

FUND. YES THAT IS CORRECT WE DO

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:45.448
NOT. OKAY IT'S VERY TROUBLING-

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.016
TO HEAR THAT AND I JUST THINK

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.985
THAT- THAT SOMETHING THAT I

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.419
THINK BREAKS THE PROMISE THAT

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:52.221
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE TO

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:53.522
TAKE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.224
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION BATES-

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.660
TO- CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY SAID

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.695
THEY WOULD. WOULDN'T DIVERT I

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:02.498
GUESS SIX DOLLARS- MOVING TO

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.268
THE TO- MAYBE TO RESET CAN

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.603
ANSWER THIS IN REGARDS TO-

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.572
THOUGH THOSE IN TODAY THE WATER

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.807
THE WILL THAT THE STATE WATER

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:16.178
PROJECT- AND- THE WATER BUDGET-

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.147
I KNOW. THAT THERE WAS A I

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:21.684
REQUEST TO. SHE ALLOCATE A

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.619
MILLION DOLLARS FOR COSTS

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:24.787
ASSOCIATED WITH SUING THE

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:25.721
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE

BIOLOGICAL PINIONS- THE

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.692
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUING THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER THAT

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.595

YOU'RE ASKING. FOR ADDITIONAL

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:36.532

THERE'S THE STATE'S ASKING FOR.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.504
IT STATES SUING DEVELOPMENT

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.606

OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT THE

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.534
LITIGATION BUT IT IS FOR BOTH

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.736
OF THE AGENCIES OR ALSO

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.737
COORDINATING ON THIS SO IT IS

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.140
A- COORDINATED EFFORT SURE. I

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:27.076
MEAN. I JUST TO BE CLEAR I MEAN

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.878
I BELIEVE THAT THIS. WHOLE

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.379
LITIGATION ON THE BIOPSY IS

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:34.316
UNNECESSARY THAT. THE THAT THE

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.351
STATE AND THE FEDERAL

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:35.918
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE WORKING

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:39.488
TOGETHER- TO DEVELOP- SOME TYPE

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.489

AN OPERATIONAL. I MEAN SO. IT

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.162
SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.030
WASTEFUL COSTS IF WE CAN HAVE

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:48.731
THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.699
GOVERNMENT WORK TOGETHER. TO

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.034

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.170
ME IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:57.840
WITHDRAWING THE LITIGATION- SO

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:58.441
THAT THE MILLION DOLLARS COULD

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:01.410
BE SAVED. BUT THERE'S NO

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.145
PROPOSAL AS OR THIS DOES NOT

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:04.280
REFLECT ANY PROPOSAL TO

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:06.782
LITIGATION INVOLVES MULTIPLE

STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES- AND

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.554

AND WE WOULD TO BE SOMETHING WE

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:28.197
WOULD BE SAVING A MILLION

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.099

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.107
THAT WORD BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.842
SURE THAT WE'RE ON SINCE AT THE

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:42.211
TIME. I IN TERMS OF THE PARKS-

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.280
BUDGET. I NOTICED THAT. THAT

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.281
WOULD BE. THE STATE OF

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.182
CALIFORNIA AND ITS ANALYSIS

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.517
SAYS THAT THERE IS A BILLION

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:50.219
DOLLARS IN DEFERRED. PARK

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.253

THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE LA

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.423

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.457
DEPARTMENT AS IF THEY WANT TO

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.093
FOLLOW UP. SO IT SEEMS

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.194
