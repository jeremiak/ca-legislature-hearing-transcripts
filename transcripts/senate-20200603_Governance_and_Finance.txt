MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS I AM MERRICK MICKEY CAPITAL LONG POLICY REPRESENTING THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT AND CAREFULLY BALANCED MEASURE TO ADDRESS A TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITY THAT IS TURNED INTO A SHOW FOR USE. UNDER PROP THIRTEEN. PROPERTIES ON BEST UPON THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AND UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW CORPORATIONS HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE LEGAL IDENTITIES FROM THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. TAKEN OWN PROPERTY IN THEIR OWN NAME.

ANY THERE TO THERE IS A RELATED AND THE- AND IF THEY KEPT ALL THE ENTITIES OWNERSHIP INTEREST 50% THAT THEY CAN SIMPLY SELL UP PRETTY.

RICE AND WE'RE GONNA. OVER THE DEAN AND SENATE LAST YEAR. Q. STRUCTURE I'M- JUST MAYBE REAR. TOURIST TO SOME OF THE COMMON THAT HAVE BEEN. MISTER CHAIR. IS IT. SAYS THE- NEEDS. CURRENT FUNDING WHICH- SEEMS LIKE AN- REASON TO OPPOSE OF ONE WE'VE- GET THIS. BILL PAY. IN A MAN. TO STRING. IT BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT. HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED FOR A LONG TIME. SO SOMEONE SAYING THAT IT WAS A DISTRACTION FOR SPLIT ROLE SEEMS. HISTORICALLY INACCURATE- THIS IS BEEN ATTEMPTED BY SENATOR BATES. ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS- ALONG WITH. I BELIEVE SPLIT ROLE WAS INTRODUCED AS A- TECHNIQUE TO RAISE. POST A PROPER TAXES SO- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY RESEARCHER. I'M ALSO CURIOUS IF THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT- IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE ANOTHER CO AUTHOR I'M HAPPY TO DO SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR THE VICE YEARS OFFERING HIMSELF UP AND TO BE A CO AUTHOR VERY VERY GRATEFUL SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORDS ARE NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR NIELSEN. NIELSEN THANK YOU MISSION THEN I TO LOW ECHO MY SUPPORT FOR THE MEASURE. AND I WILL NOTE THAT THE SO CALLED SPLIT ROLE OR TREATING BUSINESS A CALL TO HOMEOWNERS. WAS NOT A FULL IT WAS INTENDED FOR EQUITY PARITY THAT A CRUCIAL TIME. AND EVERY. EVERY YEAR SAID FROM THIRTEEN. THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO SPLIT THE ROLE HERE YET AGAIN. THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE DOES NOT DO HARM TO THAT AT ALL IT'S A KIND OF I DON'T RECALL TO CLEAN UP. BUT THE POINT IS WE CANNOT CHARACTERIZE PROP THIRTEEN IS SOME DISASTER WE'VE DONE VERY WELL SENSE AND THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS. HAVE BENEFITTED AND BUSINESSES AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY BUSINESS SHOULD NOT EQUITABLY BE CONSIDERED THIS IS NOT A LOOPHOLE WAS FULLY ATTENDED. YOU SO MUCH MISTER SENATOR PLEASE GOING TO GO TO CENTER WIENER SAN WIENER THE MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- HIGH- WHAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY- I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- BUT IT IS- TOO NARROW TO ME IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND WHETHER IT WAS A LOOPHOLE OR INTENDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT I WAS NOT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. EIGHT YEARS OLD AT THE TIME- SO I AM NOT SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HERE- BUT I WILL SAY THAT. YOU KNOW MY SENSE IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE VOTING ON PROP THIRTEEN THE FOCUS WAS ON. PEOPLE BEING POTENTIALLY PUSH UP THEIR HOMES BY HAVING THEIR PROPERTY TAXES INCREASE PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF MODEST MEANS ARE ON FIXED INCOMES I DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE NUTS VOTING ON WHETHER THE- TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID IN BANK OF AMERICA- BUILDING. IN SEVENTY WOULD RECEIVE THIS OR FRANKLY MORE PROP THIRTEEN- TREATMENT THAN PEOPLE'S HOMES AND SO HAS REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS INTENDED OR WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A LOOPHOLE- RIGHT THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY INEQUITABLE SYSTEM NOW- AND WE HAVE. THE ABILITY OF- PARTICULARLY LARGER COMMERCIAL. LANDOWNERS TO STRUCTURE TRANSACTIONS IN WAYS THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN'T. WRITE HOMEOWNERS IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO STRUCTURE TRANSACTIONS IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS PROP THIRTEEN RECESS ON- AND THAT'S ABOUT. VERY IT'S NOT A RESULT THEY WERE GIVING NOT JUST. THE SAME BUT EVEN MORE PROTECTION THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES- THE OTHER PIECE OF IT THERE'S A HUGE INEQUITY AMONG. A BUSINESSES AND AGAIN KEEPING IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S WHAT I KNOW BEST THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE SALES FORCE TOWER YOUR BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING- THAT'S- I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS BUT- YOU KNOW ICE THAT'S THAT'S NOT FAIR. JUST IN TERMS OF A MOM BUSINESSES- HAVING TO HAVING THAT KIND OF IN EQUITY AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT EXIST PHILOSOPHICALLY. SHOULD LARGE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS RECEIVE PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTION AGAIN THE ANSWER IS NO- AND I THINK WE SHOULD STRUCTURALLY ALL THAT- THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH- AND SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY WITH ALL RESPECT TO- OF THE AUTHOR WHO I KNOW IS COMING AT THIS FROM A GOOD PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER WINNER WERE VERY GRATEFUL APPRECIATE THOSE WORDS NOT LIKE TO BE A TO SEE I HAVE A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE TURN OVER TO SENATOR BATES BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION.

HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOST TAXED BY SHARES MADE A MOTION THIS IS A DO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS- IT'S JUST A FEW CLOSING WORDS AND- AGAIN WILL TURN IT OVER TO.

IN SUPPORT OR NOT TO BEGIN SUPPORTER NOT THIS NOVEMBER. VOTERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON THE QUESTION. ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. THIS BILL- PRIOR TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT THAT TAKES A PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO THIS COMPLICATED IN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE. A AND THIS IS NO SLIGHT ON THIS AUTHOR- THIS AUTHOR AT SENATOR BATES HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HARD WORKING. SHE'S BEEN COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE AND HAS TAKEN TIME TAKEN TIME TO BE A TO DEVELOP THE POLICY.
