00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.689
THAT GOT PUT IN THE OUT YEAR.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:14.059
END AND SO WHAT I'M DRIVING AT.

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.528
IS I MEAN THERE'S AN INJECTION

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:19.330
WELL AT WATER RECYCLING IN

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.433
MONTEREY WHERE THERE. REALLY

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.635
STUCK IN THE STATE IS ABOUT TO

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.570
ORDER THEM TO CUT MORE. ARE

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.439
THEY COULD GET MORE WATER THEY

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.474
COULD UPGRADE WELLS IN SANTA

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.975
CRUZ THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:39.084
GET MORE WATER. THE BIG. BASIN

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.651
FIRE. DIST DESTROYED THE WAR

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:40.819
ALONG FOR BIG BASS WATER. IN

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.453
THOSE PEOPLE TO REBUILD OR

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.020
THEIR ARE ABOUT OF ONE AND

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.988
THERE'S A PART CAN. THAT NEEDS

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:46.491
TO GO THERE'S THE VALVES IN THE

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:58.303
PROJECTS THAT- IF THE SALINAS

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:58.970
RIVER AND THE RED. ARE WAS JUST

00:28:59.037 --> 00:28:59.637
REFER TO. AND YOU LOOK AT THESE

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:01.005
HEIGHTS. YOU HAVE NO WISH. THE

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.407
DOES COME OF PROUD. APPLY FOR

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:03.141
TWO AND YET THEY'RE GOING TO

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.110
RUN OUT A WALL. AND SO WHAT I'M

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:06.411
LOOKING AT IS NOT THAT THERE'S

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:08.279
A LOT OF MONEY THERE FOR A LOT

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.148
OF DIFFERENT LINE ITEMS TELL ME

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:11.916
HOW IT'S GOING TO BE REDIRECTED

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.318
TO THE DROUGHT AND MEET THE

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:16.788
NEEDS THAT ARE. THAT ARE URGENT

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:19.157
AND GOING ON RIGHT NOW. YEAH

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.558
IT'S ALL JUST GOING TO A FEW

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.460
SPECIFIC POP THE FUNDING THAT

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:23.728
WE DO HAVE A TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.497
TWO. FOR DROUGHT EARLIER THIS

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.365
YEAR WE DID FIVE HUNDRED

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.167
MILLION DOLLARS- PER SMALLER

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.503
SUPPLIERS- AND URBAN WHILE

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:32.871
WATER MAGIC GRANTS.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.773
SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS PURELY ON

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.343
VALUE ISSUES. ON SIGMA WITH THE

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:39.611
MONEY WE'RE ADDING NOW AND THE

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:41.312
JUNE BUDGET THAT'S A HUNDRED

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.148
AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.482
TWENTY ONE TWENTY. FIVE YOU

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.986
COULD LIVE A CORE- SIGMA GRAFT-

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.854
SWEEP IN ANOTHER PROGRAM WHICH

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:52.023
WE KNOW ALSO HELPS- DURING

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.725
DROUGHT ESPECIALLY AND FORMER

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.860
SIDE. SO THAT'S UP FIFTY

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.996
MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE

00:29:58.062 --> 00:30:00.398
TWENTY TWO SO. WE CAN. KIND OF

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:01.699
SHOW YOU A BREAKDOWN OF ALL THE

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.067
TWENTY ONE NO. I GET SOME OF

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.202
THAT BREAK DOWN I MEAN I

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:05.737
HAPPENED TO BE IN THE CABINET

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.338
WHEN SIGNAL WAS ADOPTED CIGNA

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:09.440
IS IT NECESSARILY A DRAFT

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:12.076
PROGRAM. I STRONGLY SUPPORTED

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.279
ONE WHAT'S IN THERE BUT- BUT-

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:21.986
THE RECYCLING IF. IT WERE- AND

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:22.620
THERE WAS ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT.

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:23.188
OUR RISK RAISE CENTER WHITE

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.155
HOUSE IS SPEAKING MY YEAR.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:24.956
WHICH IS THE THING THAT

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:27.325
PROVIDES WATER IN AN EMERGENCY

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:28.760
QUICKER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS A

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:30.562
WATER RECYCLING. AND WHEN THE

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.197
WATER BOND WAS ADOPTED IN

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:35.033
TWENTY FOURTEEN. ARE THERE WAS

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:35.733
EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY I

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.834
BELIEVE MILLION DOLLARS-

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.337
SUBSCRIBE IMMEDIATELY ACROSS

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:40.338
THE STATE. AND IT PROVIDES

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:43.841
WATER. IN IT IN A VERY. A

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.710
DISPERSED MANNER ALL ACROSS THE

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:49.214
STATE IS IN. D. NEGOTIATIONS

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.748
ARE LET GO SHE ASIANS BUT THE

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.483
NUMBER GOT DROPPED AND THEN.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.319
THERE IS ONE THING THAT WOULD

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:55.987
PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.322
WATER AND IT IS NOT THE

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.357
FEATURED IN A MAJOR WAY IN THIS

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:02.427
AND SO- I'M COGNIZANT OF THE

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:06.064
FACT THIS IS A DEAL. IT'S DONE.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.332
HOME OR PASS THE AMENDMENT

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:09.434
DEADLINE BUT THESE ARE NEEDS

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.635
THAT ARE REAL AND ARE GOING

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:14.239
AWAY AND SO- I DON'T THINK ANY

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:15.373
OF THE SIGMA MONEY'S GOING TO

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.209
GO TO DROUGHT RELIEF. BUT SO I

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:19.711
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:21.246
CAN WORK ON THIS AND THAT

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:23.081
THERE'S SOME KIND OF.

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:24.382
COMMITMENT THAT IF ALL THESE

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.450
ARE IN CATEGORIES THAT DON'T

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.485
WORK FOR WATER DISTRICTS ACROSS

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.254
THE STATE. OR CITIES OR

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.255
COUNTIES THAT ARE RUNNING OUT

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:33.358
OF WATER. THERE'S A COMMITMENT

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:34.926
TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:37.128
AND WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS AND

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.663
DO A DEFICIENCY LETTER OR

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.498
WHATEVER IT TAKES. BECAUSE I

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.699
KNOW SOME OF IT THAT WAS MOST

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:43.301
IMPORTANT TO ME GOT PUT ME OUT

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:44.902
OF HERE WHEN THE DROUGHT IS NOW

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:45.803
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.572
TRIGGERED THIS. BUT BUT IT'S

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:50.375
JUST I'M LOOKING FOR. A DESIRE

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:52.377
TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:54.579
IF WHAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.114
NOT GONNA RAIN STORM THAT'S

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.982
REMOTELY SIGNIFICANT TILL

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:00.418
NOVEMBER COULD BE DECEMBER. AND

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:01.486
PEOPLE OR IT'S JUST GOING TO

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:04.489
GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. AND

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:06.424
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NEEDS NOW

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.360
AND IT HITS LOWER INCOME MORE

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.796
REMOTE COMMUNITIES FIRST. AND

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:13.097
THAT IS JUST GOING TO BE AN

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:17.769
ISSUE SO I'VE SAID MY PIECE.

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:18.369
BUT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING. FOR

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:21.339
COOPERATE ON THIS PATH IF WE

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:21.939
MOVE INTO THIS AND PEOPLE NEED

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:29.080

CLARA VALLEY WAS JUST ASKING A

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:49.334
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.336
APPLICABLE AND I DON'T THINK

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.771
WE'VE GOT THOSE ANSWERED THUS

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:56.240
FAR SPECIFICALLY ENOUGH. WHAT

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.276
THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO KNOW

00:32:58.343 --> 00:32:59.577
FOR SURE FROM FINANCE FROM THE

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:03.348
GOVERNOR IS THAT AS WE THEN

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:06.184
AFTER THE BUDGET. THAT DOES

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.554
WONDERS WILL BE TIMELY EXPANDED.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:16.160
A INVESTIGATION DONE BY. PBS A

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.695
LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:19.931
DISCLOSED THAT SUBSTANTIAL

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:22.200
DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:24.268
PUT IN THE BUDGET FOR WILDLAND

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.839
MANAGEMENT. FIRE PREVENTION WAS

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:32.643
NOT SPENT. WITH WITH HEALTH.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.846
AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHO THE

00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:36.147
AUTHORITY WAS THAT MADE THAT

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:38.783
DETERMINATION. BUT THEN WE HAD

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.585
SOME INSIGHT EARLY THIS YEAR AS

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:43.287
THE BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED. SOME

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:45.556
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:48.426
WAS DIRECTED FOR THESE PURPOSES

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:50.428
FOR SOMEONE OF LAND MANAGEMENT

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.996
TO PREVENT THESE CATACLYSMIC

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:56.300
FIRES. HOWEVER THE CABINET IN

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:59.103
THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SAID.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.406
THAT IT HAD TO BE DETERMINED AS

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.141

LANGUAGE. IN THE BUDGET. THAT

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:20.591

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.461
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO THE

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.997
RESOURCES AGENCY TO NOT EXPAND

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:28.132
THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE THEN

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.802

SOME DETAILS. IF THEY'RE

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.286
GENERALLY PART OF FINANCE- SO

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:49.620
YOU'RE PREGNANT EARLIER THIS

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:51.689
YEAR THAT WAS- THE THOUGHT THAT

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.791
WE HAVE OR WE WERE PRETTY SEVEN

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:54.425
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THEN

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:56.661
WE WOULD PROVIDE THE TWENTY

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:57.228
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WITH

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:57.762
AUTHORITY TO ACCELERATE.

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.530
HOWEVER IN THIS BUDGET I WILL

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.665
PRESENT TO YOU NOW WE'RE

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.899
ACTUALLY APPROPRIATING THE

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:03.534
ENTIRE AMOUNT TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.369
TWO. FOUR NINE HUNDRED AND

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.103
EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.039
THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.007
THERE IS NO. ADDITIONAL

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:12.243
AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE TO THE

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.111
MOVE THAT BACK- WITHOUT ANY

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:16.247
KIND OF FUTURE LEGISLATION. AND

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:19.317
SO THAT THAT- KIND OF- KIND OF

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:20.551
THOUGHT THAT WE HAD BACK IN

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:24.489
JUNE. IF. NOT WE'LL MOVE

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.089
FORWARD WITH ITS BUDGET. WELL

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.290
THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS HELPFUL

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:28.926
SIR AND- I KNOW WE ALL WILL

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:33.130
APPRECIATE THAT. SOMEWHAT OF A

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:35.633
CONCERN THEN IS THAT THIS

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.569
BUDGET IS PROVIDING MONEY OVER

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:42.707
SEVERAL YEARS. AND THE LACK OF

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:46.577
SPECIFICITY IS OF CONCERN. SO

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.679
HOW WILL THIS BE MONITORED AND

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.848
REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE I

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:51.682
DON'T WANT I WOULD COME BACK

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:53.651
NEXT YEAR AS THE BUDGET IS

ALTHOUGH THE COUPLE THINGS AS

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.680

DOLLARS- I THINK THAT

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.137
PERSPECTIVE THAT WE HAVE IS. TO

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.205

OVER T SERGIO- FOR FURTHER

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:46.203

THOSE YOU KNOW HI I'M FIRE RISK

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:56.213
AREAS AFTER THAT IS- ONE OF THE

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.549
KEY FOCUSES OF. THE CRITERIA

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.619
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE GRAPH

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.554
OF PROGRAMS WITH MR. I WOULD

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:07.057
THEN ASK. THE MANAGER I'LL-

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:09.393

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:13.130
ABOUT MAYBE HAVING A SCHEDULE

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.699
OF THINGS THAT YOU WERE GOING

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:18.168
TO BE SPENDING MONEY ON. COULD

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:19.703

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.785
BILL THE TRAILER BILL CLEAN UP

00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:57.053
LEGISLATION FOR FIRE. SO OVER

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.055
THE BREAK I ACTUALLY DID SOME

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:01.858
RESEARCH IN BETWEEN WATCHING MY-

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.961
COMMUNITIES BURNED OUT. AND I

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:07.431
FOUND THAT THERE WAS FOUR

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:08.198
HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.900
DOLLARS WITH THE PROJECT AND I

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:10.500
HAVE THE LIST RIGHT HERE IN MY

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:13.069
HAND. AND IT'S NOT PROJECTS IN

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.571
MY DISTRICT IT'S PROJECTS ALL

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.740
OVER CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE IN

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:19.609
EVERYONE IN YOUR DISTRICT. I

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:20.177
MAY HAVE TREES YOU MAY HAVE

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:23.680
CHAPARRAL. BUT OUR COMMUNITIES

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.816
WILBUR IF WE DO NOT DO

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:26.316
SOMETHING WITH EDUCATION

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:29.853
MANAGER THESE ARE. MIND YOU

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.456
SHOVEL READY PROJECTS SO I

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:36.326
SUBMITTED THESE. LESS TO THE

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:39.329
BUDGET CHAIRS I SUBMITTED THEM

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.564
TO. THE SUB TWO MEMBERS I

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.732
SUBMITTED THEM TO THE PEOPLE

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:45.502
WHO MAKE THIS PLACE WORK. AND

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.737
I'M ON. THE WRONG SIDE OF THE

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:48.472
AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:50.574
BECAUSE- EVEN THOUGH I

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.743
SUBMITTED ALL THESE PROJECTS.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.846
IN THE BILITY GET THE MONEY ON

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:57.681
THE GROUND TO GET IT DONE. THIS

00:51:57.747 --> 00:52:00.550
WILL HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE A

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:03.420
PROCESS THAT SET OUT THE WE ARE

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:06.590
IN A BUDGET HEARING TODAY. AND

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:07.324
WE'RE GONNA LISTEN TO THE

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.426
PUBLIC. AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:11.962
THEIR TESTIMONY WHICH- I

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:12.562
BELIEVE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:15.365
BECAUSE- IF I HAVE A LEGISLATOR

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.734
CAN'T GET. THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:20.570
TALK ABOUT. IN A WAY TO AMEND

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.639
BILLS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DO

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:23.607
SOMETHING ON HE GROUND I DON'T

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:25.108
KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC CAN EVER

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:28.311
INFLUENCES PLACE. TODAY I

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:29.880
WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:33.283
ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.486
WANT TO SHARE. WHAT WE FAILED

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:42.225
OUR STATE. WITH POLICY NUMBER.

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:42.859
ONE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TREATING

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:45.195
A HALF A MILLION ACRES. THE CAL

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:47.764
FIRE FOLKS COUNT ACRES THAT'S

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.666
TREATED BETTER TIMBER HARVEST

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:51.468
PLANS WHICH PRIVATE COMPANIES

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:53.370
DO ON THEIR OWN LAND. WE ASKED

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.505
HIM THAT IN SUB TWO AND THEY

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.007
SAID THAT'S TRUE THAT'S

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:58.408
PROPERTIES THAT DIDN'T COST THE

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:00.877
STATE A DIME ACTUALLY WE MADE

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.446
MONEY OFF OF THEM. AND THAT'S

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.014
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.651
ACRES. AS I'VE WATCHED MY CAN

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:09.719
SO WE WHEN WE REALLY TALK ABOUT

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.421
TREATING ACRES AND WHAT MONIES

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:12.255
WERE SPENDING ON IT THEY'RE

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.323
COUNTING ACRES THAT THEY DON'T

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.558
EVEN SPEND A DIME ON IS ARE

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.293
TREATED ACRES TOOK THE NARROW

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:17.294
IT DOWN TO LOOK AT ABOUT A

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.697
MONEY WE'RE SPENDING. ON ACRES

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:24.000
IT'S A LOT HIGHER. COST. SO I'M

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:27.203
ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO. GET

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.205
OBJECTS DONE FIRE SAFETY

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:30.874
PROJECTS DONE AROUND

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:31.408
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.176
STATE. SO WE DON'T BURN OUR

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:35.912
COMMUNITIES DOWN. NOW WE ALL

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.647
KNOW THAT THE EIGHTH WONDER OF

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.915
THE WORLD WAS ALMOST ON PAR

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:41.651
WHICH I CALL TAHOE. I REPRESENT

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:44.187
ALL OF LAKE TAHOE. AND WHEN THE

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.289
FIRE CAME OVER THE RIDGE. AND

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:48.158
INTO THE VALLEY THERE WAS A

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:49.759
FIRE BREAK THERE WE HAVE BEEN

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:50.994
DOING SOME FIRE BREAKS AROUND

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.063
THE LAKE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN

00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:55.398
YEARS SINCE THE ANGORA FIRE. WE

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:56.833
WERE ABLE TO BACK FIRE AT THE

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.268
FIRE BREAKING ACTUALLY TURN THE

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:02.472
FIRE AND SAVE. LAKE TAHOE. CAN

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.541
YOU IMAGINE WHAT GREENVILLE

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:05.108
WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE HAD A

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.110
FIRE SAFETY. AROUND THAT

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.278
COMMUNITY WE WOULD STILL HAVE A

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:11.514
COMMUNITY THERE. SO I HAVE

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:13.650
AMENDMENTS MADAM CHAIR THAT I

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:14.818
WANT TO PROPOSE I DON'T KNOW

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.353
HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS I'VE

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:18.188
NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE BUT I

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.056
HAVE AN IMAGE THAT I WANT. THE

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.925
BUDGET TO REFLECT THAT IF

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.094
THERE'S A PART OF A PROJECT

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.695
THAT IS AVAILABLE WHAT THAT

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.364

IS BUSY FIGHTING FIRE. OR IF IT

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.405
IS THROUGH CAL FIRE THAN THEY

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:37.941
HAVE TO GET THE FUNDS OUT. BY

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.643

I CAME TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.019
TRIED TO EDUCATED THAT THERE'S

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:25.121
ONLY ONE WAY. ONE THING THAT WE

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:26.923
CAN ACTUALLY DO TO STOP FIRE

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.291
THAT'S TAKE THE FUEL WAY AT

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.026
LEAST AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:32.228

TAKE AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT.

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.689
BECAUSE THE WAIVERS WE APPROVED

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.360

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.065
A CONSERVANCY FOR SOUTH LA. SO

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.801
I'M JUST CURIOUS DEPARTMENT OF

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.569
FINANCE ARE WHAT'S THE

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:56.672
REASONING BEHIND LEAVING OUT. A

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.908
CONSERVANCY THAT SERVICES ALL

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:01.110
OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND HOW

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.813
ARE THESE DETERMINATIONS MADE-

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.047
WITH REGARDS TO WHICH

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:07.349
CONSERVANCY'S GOT ALLOCATIONS

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:15.624
AND HOW MUCH THEY GOT. THE HIGH

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.693
TENSION MASTER JAGGER PART OF

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.528
FINANCE I THINK I WOULD KNOW

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.464
THAT YOU'RE GENERALLY WE TRY TO

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.432
LOOK AT THE THAT KIND OF HIGHLY

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.634
HIGHER FIRE RISK AREAS AS ONE

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.436
OF THE CRITERIA BY. WHAT THEY

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.505
HAD TO REALLY POINT IS ALL THE

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:33.275
CAL FIRE MR GRANTS THOSE ALL

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:35.277
COMMUNITY THAT SO JUST BECAUSE

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.879
THEY'RE NOT A SPECIFIC ANSWER

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:37.746
IF HE CALLED OUT IT DOESN'T

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.448
MEAN THAT WE GENERAL AREAS NOT

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:40.916
GETTING FUNDING. THE GRANTS

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.384
ADMINISTERED BY STATES ARE

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.586
ACTUALLY GOING OUT TO THESE

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.321
COMMUNITIES THAT APPLIED TO THE

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:48.390
FUNDING- WHICH- YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.693
DOING AS BEST WE CAN TO TRY TO

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.828
EXPEDITE- THROUGH DIFFERENT

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.697
PROCESS SEE THAT SO I JUST

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.599
GENERALLY YOU KNOW. FOCUSING ON

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.801
HIGH RISK AREAS BUT AGAIN

01:08:58.868 --> 01:08:59.935
THERE'S OTHER FUNDING IN THIS

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:02.137
PACKAGE THAT THAT ALL OF THE

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:07.576
REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.212
THAT HAVE- VIRUS GOODBYE.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.780
SERVICE CENTER FROM ORDER TO

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:12.982
HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NO I

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.183
JUST WANT TO GET CLARITY SO

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.885
THERE ARE SOME CONSERVANCIES

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:16.952
THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A DIRECT

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.320
APPLICATION AND THEN YOU'RE

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.522
SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER POT OF

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:20.823
MONEY THAT PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.526
FIGHT FOR. YEAH AND SO THAT'S

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:25.227
FOR SOUTH LA TO FIGHT FOR. TWO

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:30.099
PACKS. THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PART

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.967
OF FINDING AND YET TYPICALLY

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:34.436
REPLICATION PROCESS FOR LOCAL

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:36.338
COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO APPLY

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.540
BUT ONE OF THE STRATEGY THAT WE

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.208
ARE PLANNING HEREAS WELL IS

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:41.243
WORKING TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.879
THE LOCALS TO DEVELOP PLANS AND

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.481
DEVELOP PROJECTS THAT THEY

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.716
COULD GO THROUGH THE PIPELINE-

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.252
I'LL BE THAT CAL FIRE MR GRANT

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.655
AND THE CONSERVATIVES AND SO-

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.056
IT IS- YOU KNOW AN APPLICATION

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:57.359
PROCESS FOR. THOSE OTHER POTS

01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:02.164
OF FUNDING. THANK YOU I MEAN

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.033
I'M NOT LESS DISAPPOINTED BUT

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:04.767
AT LEAST YOU ANSWERED THE

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:08.771
QUESTION. SENATOR DRAWS- THANK

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.940
YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:13.242
COMMENT ON A B. ONE FIFTY FIVE

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.277
AND A B. ONE SIXTY TWO. IS

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:18.213
THAT. CERTAIN OKAY THANK YOU-

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.149
AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO DO

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:25.387
WITH- ECONOMIC. IMPACTS OF. OF

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:29.458
OUR RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS ON

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:34.296
A. B. ONE FIFTY FIVE. FROM. YOU

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.532
KNOW AS AS WE HAVE THE NEED FOR

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.667
PROJECTS THAT RESPOND TO OUR

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.003
OUR CLIMATE NEEDS AS THOSE- AS

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.073
THAT INCREASES. IT SEEMS TO ME

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:45.741
THAT SO DO THE NUMBER OF

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:48.010
WORKERS NEEDED TO TAKE ON-

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.680
THOSE PROJECTS- WHEN WE ADDRESS

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:55.217
ENVIRONMENTAL. ISSUES AND

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:57.119
ECONOMIC ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:59.788
REQUIRED THAT THE STATE HAS TO

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.790
ALIGN THE CLIMATE AND THE

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.860
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GOALS WE

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.161
NEED TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:09.832
AND THE PROGRAMS. TO ALLEVIATE

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.534
THOSE IMPACTS BUT ALSO IN A

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.337
MORE POSITIVE WAY BENEFIT FROM

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.339
THIS ECONOMY THIS GREEN ECONOMY

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:20.142
THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN- SO WHY

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.778
DO WE NEED. CONSERVATION WORK

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.813
FORCE DEVELOPMENT IN A VERY

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.384
EXPLICIT WAY NOT THAT MAYBE

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.753
IT'LL HAPPEN WHO KNOWS WHICH

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:33.656
ORGANIZATIONS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:34.990
DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:37.192
WORKFORCE PIPELINE TO TRAIN

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:40.729
YOUNG ADULTS. FOR STATE OR

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:43.732
LOCAL PARKS DEPARTMENTS- AND

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.734
OTHER CAREERS IN THE NATURAL

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:49.438
RESOURCES FIELD- AND I THINK

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.939
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:53.642
THE STATES OUR CLIMATE GOALS

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.944
WHICH WERE ALL IN SUPPORT OF-

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.013
THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.848
AN EXPANDED AND A SKILLED

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:03.552
WORKFORCE. READY ARM AND THAT

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:04.086
MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.754
EDUCATION THE TRAINING THE

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:09.158
CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE NEED. TO

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:11.460
BUILD THESE CLIMATE CAREERS.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.262
AND THESE CONSERVATION WORK

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.096
FORCE PROGRAMS ARE AN

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.065
OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN OUR

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.100
ECONOMIC GOALS AND OUR CLIMATE

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.770
GOALS THE WORKING POOR THE USE

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:24.206
OF- COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:25.741
LEFT OUT OF A LOT OF OTHER

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.943
CAREERS. WHAT DO THEY SEE IN

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.745
THEIR FUTURE HOW ARE THEY GOING

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.680
TO GET PREPARED FOR THAT FUTURE

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:33.449
OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT JUST

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.284
TOTALLY OUT OF OUT OF REACH FOR

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.853
THEM SO. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.224
IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC- BUT- IT'S

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.393
NOT A SPECIFIC ASK RIGHT NOW

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.394
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KIND OF

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.130
INFORMATION- ALWAYS GETS LEFT

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.299
OUT AND- I DON'T THINK THAT

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:53.302
WERE- WE'RE REALLY ADDRESSING A

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.337
NEW GREEN ECONOMY AND- ALL THE

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.605
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE FOR CLIMATE

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.707
MITIGATION IF. WE'RE NOT

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:01.810

WE'RE GOING TO HELP US REACH

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:06.048
THOSE CLIMATE GOALS- ON AB ONE

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:09.685
SIXTY TWO. I'M VERY EXCITED.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.553

ALL THE JOB CREATION. ALL OF

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.405
THAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED AND

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:33.542
I'M I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.176
A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BOB

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.645

SPENDING ON THE GROUND PROGRAMS

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.850
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BUILD

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.519
A WORKER CENTERED ON

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.121

LEAVE A COMMENT THOSE ARE JUST

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:39.888
PART OF A COMPROMISE OF

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.390
BALANCING THAT MEETS YOUR

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.392
PRIORITIES OF- BOTH THE

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:49.097
OF THAT- THIS- PACKAGE THAT

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:50.365
BEFORE YOU IS THE COMP RIGHT

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.401
BACK. C. SURGERY I'M CURIOUS

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.036
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:56.171
SAID THE GOVERNOR WANTED ONE

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:59.041
POINT SIX NINE BILLION I MAY

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:00.342

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:03.011
POINT SIX SO WE'VE- ADDED WE'RE

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.414
IN WE ARE NOW AT THREE POINT

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:05.981
SIX SEVEN FIVE BUT AS I GO

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:07.783
THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S MAY

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.918
REQUEST. TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:11.486
FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION GRANTS

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.955
HE GOT IT TWENTY FOR REGIONAL

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:17.793
CLIMATE. CREPITUS

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.828
COLLABORATIVE'S HE GOT IT-

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:23.265
WHERE'S THE OTHER THING. I KNOW

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:30.205
TO MANY FIRE. EXCUSE ME. MY

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.075
CONCERN IS THAT THE SENATE

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.743
PRIORITIES THAT WERE LAID OUT

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:39.514
IN MAY. DIDN'T RECEIVE ANYTHING.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:43.852
SO THAT'S THE ACT PACKAGE WHICH

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:44.352
I THINK THE GOVERNOR GOT

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:46.054
EVERYTHING THAT HE WANTED BUT

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.323

CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.426
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:53.628
THE GREATEST CONCERN THE SENATE

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:55.497

MISTER DOLLIES FAILED-

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.708

CLARIFY. ON THE EXTREME HEAT SO

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.847
PART OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:27.916
LOOK BAD IS LOOKING AT HOW TO

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.150
ADDRESS OUR VARIOUS CLIMATE

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.386
RISKS AND EXTREME BEING EXTREME

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.155
HEAT BEING- THE EMERGING AND

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.390
IMMEDIATE CLIMATE RISK THE

MINISTRATIONS ACTUALLY WORKING

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.994
ON AN EXTREME HEAT FRAMEWORK

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.128
THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:42.397
LATER THIS YEAR SO AS PART OF

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:43.565
THAT THAT THERE BE DIFFERENT

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.500
STRATEGY THAN. PROGRAMS THAT

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:46.968
WOULD BE DEVELOPED WHAT WE

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.336
WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME BACK TO

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:51.006
THE LEGISLATURE- WITH- OUR

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:52.007
PROPOSAL FOR THE VARIOUS

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:54.242
PROGRAMS TO THEN BE PART OF

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:55.143
THAT DISCUSSION DURING THE

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.345
BUDGET PROCESS YEAH BECAUSE IT

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.380
YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.382
HEARINGS ON THAT AND IT SEEMS

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.283
LIKE YOU'RE TREATING THE

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:02.951
CONSEQUENCE YOU KNOW WE KNOW

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.252
WHEN WE HAVE WHEN THE CLIMATE

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.587
WILL CHANGE THERE WILL BE

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.422
CONSEQUENCES WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.257
TO DO HERE. IS ANTICIPATE THE

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.826
CAUSATION THE SAY OKAY THERE'S

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:13.828
TOO MUCH FUEL IN THE FOREST WE

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:22.003
NEED TO REMOVE IT NOT WHEN. THE

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.604
FORCES BURNING UP WHAT WE HAD

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:23.271
TO ADD AFTER WE DO HAVE SOME MY-

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:23.905
FOR TREE PLANTING. LET'S GET TO

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:24.572
THE SEVEN HUNDRED C. EIGHT THAT

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:27.509
IS THE MALL BAND- FLOOD IT

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.577
SEEMS LIKE WE CONFLATED A BUNCH

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:32.514
OF- SEGMENTS AND IN THERE AND

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.481
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.216
THROUGH THE LEGEND OF THE BILL

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.285
BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOTTEN

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.520
TO HELL THAT'S BREAK. BROKEN

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:41.189
OUT BUT DAD. I DON'T YOU'RE

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.957
SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT MONEY

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.926
FOR CONSERVANCY'S OR SOME OF

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.061
THE WORK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.930
DONE FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:51.299
PROJECTS. YOU'RE GOING TO WORK

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:56.137

FUNDING AND THAT THE ALLIES

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.246
WILL USE THAT AND SO-

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.281
ENERGETICALLY DETAILS

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.083

AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SO

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.255
IT JUST LOOK AT THE CONTEXT ON

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.157
ON THAT KIND OF THE CONCEPT OF

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:18.893
THE SATISFIED- WEEKNIGHT IF

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.395
THERE'S YOU KNOW MUTUAL SHARED

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.497
PRIORITIES- WITH A DIFFERENT

RESTORATION IS ACTUALLY GONNA

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:29.170
BE COMING OUT WITH A COUPLE

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:31.005
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OVER THE

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:31.740
COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.775
MONTHS- RELATED TO THIRTY BY

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.910
THIRTY- WHICH- THE EXECUTIVE

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.746
ORDER LAST YEAR ADDED A LOT TO

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.148
A BILL PASSED. THAT CAMPAIGN IF

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.850
I'D BE A VISUAL COMPOSER WITH A

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:44.018
STRATEGY ON HOW TO ADDRESS A

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:45.553
THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS AND THEN

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.254
THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE AN

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:48.189
UPDATED NATIONAL WORKING LAND

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.024
CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY. AS TO

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:51.860
WHAT WE WANT IF WE WANT TO BE

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:54.162
ARE YOUR FUNDING TO BE INFORMED

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:55.764
BY THOSE STRATEGIES WHERE WE

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:56.831
HAVE TO HAVE TO COME BACK TO

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.767
THE LEGISLATURE TO PRESENT.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:23:59.801
HERE'S A STRATEGY THAT HERE'S

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.603
THE PROPOSED PROGRAM THAT WE

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:03.438
WANT TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.507
TYPES OF GOALS AND EFFORTS BUT

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:06.574
AGAIN THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:07.442
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THOSE

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.077
FUTURE YEARS. WELL WE ACCESS

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:10.278

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.746
CONSERVANCIES WITHIN THE

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.581
TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE IT'LL BE

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:14.883
KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A TOP

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:17.152
PRIORITY OF THE SENATE AND AS

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:19.554
LONG AS- AND MANY OTHER

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.990
NUMBERS. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.892
THINK I'M EXPRESSING MYSELF IN

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:27.061
THE RIGHT FORM IT WAS OUR IDEA

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:28.830
TO HAVE THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.331

USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WE

HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:31.706

ALLOCATE THEM AND WE'RE NOT

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.456
ALWAYS GOING TO GET THE MALACHY

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.825
DID THE WAY. THAT WE AND I

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:52.560
DON'T MEAN TO INDICATE THAT

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.829
THIS IS JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:57.198
BUT- IT'S- THE YOU KNOW THESE

01:28:57.265 --> 01:29:00.268
THINGS ARE NEGOTIATED AND- IT

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.470
IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT AS YOU

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.238
POINTED OUT CENTER WACO SKI

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:05.940
THAT WE HAVE THREE POINT SIX

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.408
BILLION DOLLARS HERE FOR

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.277
CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND I'M

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.878
CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.880
BITE AT THE APPLE TO NEGOTIATE

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:15.216
SOME OTHER DETAILS IN IT. AND

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:17.452
THAT AS WE KNOW GIVEN THAT IT

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:22.156
IS ALREADY- MIDDLE AUGUST THAT-

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:23.791
EVEN IF WE HAD APPROPRIATED IN

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.793
VARIOUS OF THE PACKAGES MORE

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.529
FOR SAY THIS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:29.130
ONE TWENTY TWO IT WOULD HAVE

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.766
BEEN HARD. TO EXPENDITURES DUE

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:33.668
TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE THAT WE

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.703
WEREN'T EXPECTING WE DON'T HAVE

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.672
EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO SPEND

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.040
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY SO I

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:42.276
THINK THIS IS A- REALLY GOOD

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.245
TIME FOR US TO BE. BRITAIN

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:45.546
ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.048
GETTING INTO MORE DETAIL SO

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:50.384
THAT WE CAN. REALLY VISIT AND

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.120
ALSO OBVIOUSLY IN OUR

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:52.987
APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:56.824
FOLLOWING YEAR. BUT I AM VERY

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.760
VERY IMPRESSED AND I THINK WE

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.728
SHOULD ALL BE THAT WE ARE

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.663
DIRECTING THIS LEVEL OF

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.732
INVESTMENT TOWARDS WILDFIRE

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.467
TOWARDS DROUGHT. TOWARDS

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:09.704
CLIMATE RESILIENCY SO AGAIN I

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:11.606
HAVE THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.941
FRUSTRATIONS IN. I GOT A

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:15.676
SERVICE MANAGER PLEASE I DO

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.311
WHAT I WANT FOR US BUT I THINK

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.113
WE ALSO DO I DON'T WANT TO AND

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.848
IT IS A FUNNY ANALOGY TO MAKE

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:21.983
EITHER ONE OF THEM IS THE

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.918
FORESIGHT WHICH I DO HAVE. WE

01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:25.853
MADE A BUDGET DEAL THAT SAID WE

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.555
WERE GOING TO SPEND FOUR

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.523
HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.291
THIS BUDGET YEAR ON CLIMATE

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.460
RESILIENCE AND THAT WAS AGAINST

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:33.995
THE SENATE RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.263
WE TAKE THE THREE POINT SIX

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:36.998
CENTS PER ITEM OFF OVER THREE

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:38.432
YEARS. THE MEASURE IN FRONT OF

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.301
US IS ONLY SPENDING THREE

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:44.138
POINT. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:44.906
NINE. MILL SO WHERE DID THE

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.307
OTHER SEVENTY ONE MILLION GO

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.109
THAT DAY WE ALREADY GOT CHOPPED

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:50.645
DOWN BUT NOW WE GOT CHOPPED

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:51.145
DOWN ANOTHER SEVENTY ONE

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:53.347
MILLION WERE. THE FIRE

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:54.882
PREVENTION OR ALL THESE OTHER

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.617
PROGRAMS CLIMATE YOU KNOW SAN

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.051
HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF TANGIBLE

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.452
WORK PODUCT THAT COMES FROM

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:14.522

EXCITING TIME VALUE TO

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:43.117
ASSIGNMENTS YES THOSE WOULD

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.518

STUDY HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:57.798
THAT IS THE MORE TRADITIONAL

01:33:57.865 --> 01:34:03.337
INDEPENDENT STUDY. THERE'S ALSO.

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:03.971

INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT THEY'RE

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:17.184
OFFERING. AND STUDENTS WOULD

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:20.021
JUST GET- THEY WOULD EARN A

01:34:20.087 --> 01:34:21.789
PORTION OR THEY'RE ONLY EIGHT

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:22.990
BASED ON THEIR THE PERCENTAGE

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:24.325
OF COMPLETION OF THE COURSE AND

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:26.327
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.162
THE WORK PRODUCT AND THAT THAT

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.996

THE MOST RECENT- CDC GRANT- THE

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:00.374
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS I

01:38:00.441 --> 01:38:02.176
BELIEVE WAS WHAT IS ALLOCATED

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:05.246
TO LOCAL- HEALTH JURISDICTIONS.

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.313
AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.514
TYPICAL IN TERMS OF A

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:10.584
PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL- MOST OF

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:12.386
THESE GRANTS DO TYPICALLY GET

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:14.355
ALLOCATED TO LOCAL HEALTH

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:15.456
JURISDICTIONS AND THAT'S THE

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:17.558
WAY THAT WE- CONTINUE TO ROLL

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.127
OUT MOST OF THOSE GRANTS- EIGHT

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:22.463
WITH RESPECT TO- INVESTMENTS IN

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:24.765
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THEIR-

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:25.599
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:27.968
THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:30.504
CONCERT WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND-

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:34.174
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING-

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:36.477
WE HAD AGREED TO A BUDGET

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:38.212
CHANGE PROPOSAL AND THAT JULY

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:40.080
BUDGET. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:41.148
PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO AN

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.950
EVALUATION AND A LOOK AT WHERE

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:46.320
THOSE NEEDS ARE. AND THE- THREE

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:47.121
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.188
INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:52.059
BEGINNING NEXT YEAR- THE

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.827
ANALYSIS IS BEING DONE AS PART

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:56.930
OF THAT- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.265
WILL- INFORMANT THE

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:00.834
ALLOCATIONS- FOR THE THREE

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:01.902
HUNDRED NO I APPRECIATE THAT

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:03.304
BUT OF THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:04.538
ALLOCATED IN THIS BUDGET FROM

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:05.606
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE YOU

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:09.243
TELLING ME THAT. NONE OF THAT

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.777
IS GOING TO GO TOWARD THAT

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:11.412
PURPOSE. IT DEPENDS BECAUSE WE

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:13.614
DON'T NECESSARILY CONTROL HOW

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.382
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:16.784
ALLOCATE THEIR RESOURCES SO

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:19.353
THERE'S CERTAINLY- COULD SPEND

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.854
THE SITE YOU KNOW. PART OF THAT

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.189
SIZEABLE YOU KNOW OUTLAY OF

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:24.558
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR-

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.759
INFRASTRUCTURE POTENTIALLY BUT

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:27.328
OKAY AND I THINK THAT ALL OF

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.495
THIS FUNDS IS GOING ON TO THE

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:29.863
LOCALS AND NONE OF ITS BEING

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:33.267
RETAINED BY THE STATE. JUST

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:33.867
REALLY WHICH IS THE PATHS PASS

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:36.337
THROUGH. THE MAJORITY IS GOING

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:37.371
TO LOCAL CULTURE CONTINUES

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.106
VINDICATE THE ROUGH PERCENTAGE

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:42.843
ARE WE TALKING 80% 60% NINETY

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.878
FIVE PERCENT. HISTORICALLY IT'S

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.580
SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY THIRTY

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:47.514
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO COMMIT

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:48.615

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.451

INCREASING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:14.328

WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO I

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:23.336
WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE MY-

01:47:23.403 --> 01:47:25.105
SUPERINTENDENTS WANT TO HAVE

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:27.207
THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO THEY CAN

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.210
MANAGE. THEIR COVERED OUTBREAKS

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:31.912

HAVING A HECK OF  TIME-

01:47:34.414 --> 01:47:35.849

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.662
GETTING GETTING NO SUBSTITUTE

01:47:48.728 --> 01:47:50.096
AND SO THAT'S IT WAS IT WAS THE

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:51.898
NUMBER ONE QUESTION FROM

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:53.934
THROUGHOUT MY NINE COUNTIES

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.901
FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:56.369
SCHOOLS IF THEY HAVE THAT

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.638
FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THEY

01:47:58.705 --> 01:48:10.917
GET THE ADA. THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY

01:48:10.984 --> 01:48:13.653
A POINT OKAY. NO PROBLEM

THERE IS FRUSTRATION AND SO

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:26.466
MANY FOLKS ARE TIRED BASED OFF

CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. WHEN

01:48:36.509 --> 01:48:37.544

WILDFIRES HERE IN THE UNITED

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:41.715
STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.416
JUST THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.051
THIS CLIMATE CRISIS IS ADDING

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:48.521
TO THE CRISIS AT THE STATE

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:50.824
FACES. EACH AND EVERY SUMMER

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:54.794

AND WE HAVE THIS YEAR. BUT IS

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:25.258
ALSO INCREDIBLY CLEAR. COMING

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:27.661
FROM A REGION OF THE STATE THAT

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:31.364
HAS THE FIRST MILLION ACRE FIRE.

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:34.267
WHERE A COUNTY LIKE LAKE HAS

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:34.834
TWO THIRDS OF HIS LAND MASS

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:37.504
BURN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:38.939
THAT WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:40.640
FOR A LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLAN

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:43.443
ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRE

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:45.278
PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. AND I

01:49:45.345 --> 01:49:47.080
KNOW THAT I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:47.981
RECORD EACH AND EVERY BUDGET

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:52.352
CYCLE. BUT CAL FIRE ACTUALLY.

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:57.624
PEAKED WITH STAFFING BACK IN.

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:58.792
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. NINETEEN

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:01.661
SEVENTY FIVE NOW I WILL SAY NO

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:04.698
OTHER GOVERNOR HAS INVESTED

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:08.168
MORE ON CAL FIRE AND WHAT FIRE

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:10.337
PREVENTION THE ONE THAT WE HAVE

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:15.342
HERE TODAY THE GOVERNOR'S. AND.

01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:17.477
OUR RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED THE

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:18.578
MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.513
LINES OF THESE WILDLAND FIRES

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.749
ARE EXHAUSTED AND WE NEED TO

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:25.251
TAKE A LOOK AT A LONG TERM PLAN

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:26.786
WHEN IT COMES OF FULL TIME

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:27.253
EQUIVALENT FIREFIGHTER

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.824
POSITIONS WERE STILL TWO

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:31.424
HUNDRED SIXTY ONE FIREFIGHTER

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:33.927
SHORT FULL TIME OF THAT PLANE

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.862
BEANS HAVE FAILED. AND WE CAN'T

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:37.630
CONTINUE TO RELY ON SEASONAL

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:39.032
FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING TEN

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:40.633
MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR. NOT

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.736
RECEIVING THE SAME PAY WHICH

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:44.771
CAN REALLY ADD CHALLENGES WITH.

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:45.805
IN THE SAME WORKFORCE

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:48.174
PROTECTIONS. SO WHAT I WOULD

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:50.243
HOPE IS THAT. THROUGH THE

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:52.178
LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN CASKEY

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:54.114
WHO'S BEEN ON THIS ISSUE THE

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.349
LEADERSHIP AFTER SKINNER. WHO

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:58.618
I'M GRATEFUL FOR HER DIGGING

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.886
INTO THIS ALONG WITH THE PRO

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:01.755
TEAM THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:51:01.821 --> 01:51:03.456
ABLE TO DEVELOP A LONGER TERM

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:05.492
PLAN TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.960
WILDFIRE PREVENTION LONGER

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:09.029
TERM. WHICH THE SENATE HAS LED

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:11.498
WITH THE BOND- AND HOW WE'RE

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.932
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.234
CAL FIRE RANGE TO WHERE IT

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.569
SHOULD BE- TO MEET THE MODERN

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:17.971
NEEDS AT THE GOLDEN STATE BUT I

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:20.373
JUST WANTED TO SAY MADAM CHAIR.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.408
WELL I KNOW WE'RE IN THE THICK

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.043
OF IT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:25.612
SESSION BUT TENSIONS ARE HIGH

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:27.213
BUT WE ALSO CAN'T FORGET HOW

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.015
FAR WE'VE ALSO COME THIS YEAR.

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.483
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.950
INVESTMENT AMOUNT FOR

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.652
PREVENTION RESPONSE. AND IT'S

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:36.189
CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH AND MORE

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:38.825
WORK TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:41.327
YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE LET ME SEE.

01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:50.670
ANY OTHER MIKES UP OKAY- I- WE

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:52.806
WILL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC AND

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:55.041
AT THE RISK OF THE WRATH OF

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:57.710
SOME OF YOU I THE LOOK WITH

01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:58.912
THIS IS THE LAST WEEK OF

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:01.781
SESSION AND IT DOES GET TESTY.

01:52:01.848 --> 01:52:05.385
AND THERE ARE NO ACTION THAT WE

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:07.487
TAKE WHETHER ITS BUDGETARY OR

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:09.856
LEGISLATIVE SATISFIES EVERYONE

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:11.324
NOR DID IT EVEN THOSE OF US

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:13.359
WHO. WERE MOST INTIMATELY

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:15.762
INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:17.664
WE'RE IT'S GIVE OR TAKE THERE'S

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.631
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:20.567
LEGISLATORS AND THERE'S AN

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.235
ADMINISTRATION BUT I WOULD SAY.

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.704
THAT IF WE TAKE THIS PACKAGE

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:26.106
FOR EXAMPLE OR THE SET OF BILLS

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:36.683
BEFORE. US AS SENATOR WHITE

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:38.051
HOUSE KEY POINTED OUT. B. ADMIN.

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:39.119
ONLY HAD PROPOSED. A BILLION

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:40.019
FOR CRIME REGION. WHAT WE WILL

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:40.887
VOTING ON TODAY THIS POINT FIVE

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:42.188
BILLION. NOW IT IS AND SPEND IT

BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT IN

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:47.193
THE FIRST YEAR. SO I THINK THAT

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.896
WE- IT'S OKAY TO BE FRUSTRATED

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.464
AND EXPRESSES FRUSTRATIONS BUT

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:54.300
I ALSO DO NOT WANT US TO LOSE

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:57.403
SIGHT OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.539
THAT WE ARE DOING. WITH THIS

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:00.907
WITH THE BUDGET WE'VE ALREADY

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.108
ADOPTED THE APPROPRIATIONS YOU

THE CLIMATE CRISIS WERE IN THE

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.924
MIDDLE OF THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:18.458
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ALL YEAR

ROUND FIRES NOW. AND THIS

01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:22.962
ACTION IS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE

01:53:23.029 --> 01:53:25.365
US WOULD GET THAT MONEY TO ST

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:26.633

WANTED BUT IT IS APPROVED IT IS

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:30.370
