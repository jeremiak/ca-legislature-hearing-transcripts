EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS AS THE UC EMPLOYEES. BEYOND PROVIDING WORLD CLASS INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH AT ITS CAMPUSES IN MEDICAL CENTERS THE YOU SEE THE STATE'S THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER AND IT'S AN ANCHOR IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. IN RECENT YEARS THE UC HAS OUTSOURCED AN ESTIMATED SEVEN THOUSAND SUPPORT JOBS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HIGHLY PAID ADMINISTRATORS TO APPROXIMATELY. EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIS RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL MINISTRY PAYROLL COST INCREASE OF SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT NOW. THANK YOU SEE HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED WOULD COST TO OFFER OUTSOURCED WORKERS THE FULL PROTECTIONS AN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS ENJOYED BY THE UC EMPLOYEES. ACA FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE FROM POLICIES THAT PRODUCE ECONOMIC RACIAL AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION. TO BE CLEAR NEITHER THE LEGISLATURE NOR THE GOVERNOR CAN ADDRESS A SYSTEMATIC INEQUALITIES THAT OCCUR TO THE UC'S ECONOMY UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER ARTICLE TO THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLOW VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE. I SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU ALLOW THE VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER LOW INCOME SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE THOSE WHO CLEAN THE TOILETS MOW THE LAWN SERVE OUR FOOD AND CLEAN THE BED PANS SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME STANDARDS. ENJOYED BY UC EMPLOYEES DOING THE SAME WORK.

MR CHAIRED MEMBERS -- JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM YOU SEE HEALTH -- AS AND OTHERS -- IN STRONG OPPOSITE TO IS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SORRY -- I WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TAKES ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO MAINTAIN A STABLE IN HOUSE WORKFORCE VERY SERIOUSLY -- AND TO UTILIZE CONTRACTORS FOR SPECIFIC BUSINESS PURPOSES -- IN A LIMITED AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER -- AS YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS A UNIQUE MISSION -- OF TEACHING RESEARCH AND AND UNIVERSITY SIX TO ADDRESS THIS BALANCE BY ENSURING THROAT CLICK THE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT THERE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES TO ENSURE -- DISPLACEMENT IS NOT A PROBLEM WITHIN HOUSE STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT CONVERSATIONS. A LANGUAGE THAT PREVENTS UNIVERSITY FROM CONTRACTING OUT SOLELY TO SAVE MONEY. OUR AND SO THEREFORE -- THE UNIVERSITY DOES CONTRACT OUT IN SITUATIONSWHERE WE NEED SPECIAL EXPERTISE -- SPECIAL EXPERIENCE -- FOR SITUATIONS WHERE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT IS REQUIRED AND THE LIKE -- AS SUCH WE ADDRESS THE CYCLICAL AND EPISODIC -- WORKLOAD NEEDS FOR CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS CLEAN OUT OF RESIDENTS HALLS AT THE END OF THE TERM -- CLEAN UP AFTER SPORTING EVENTS AND SO FORTH THAT ARE HELD FROM TIME TO TIME AS WELL AS PERFORMING SUCH ACTIVITIES LIKE MAINTENANCE AND OTHER TYPES OF LANDSCAPING NEEDS. THAT REQUIRE -- SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT I'M THINKING OF TREE TRIMMING THINGS LIKE THAT HERE. AGAIN I WANT TO REITERATE. YOU SEE DOES NOT DISPLACE WORKERS AS RESULT OF CONTRACTING OUT IN FACT OF THE RANKS OF THE UNION REPRESENTED WORKFORCE OF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- NINE POINT 9% OF LOOK AT THE ASPEN NUMBERS A PARTICULAR SEVENTEEN POINT 1% IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF GROWTH IN THE NUMBERS OF REPS EMPLOYEES IN THOSE PARTICULAR CATEGORIES. I KNOW THIS ISN'T FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT I WOULD POINT OUT REAL QUICKLY THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS PACKED THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL AT A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AS A RESULT IN SOURCING PREMIUM WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY -- THE UNIVERSITY ALSO ONCE MAKE CLEAR THAT WE UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED BY OUR EMPLOYEES WE DO REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING STEADILY AT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN TABLE TO RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE EXACT ISSUES OF RACE IN THIS BILL WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE APPROPRIATE POINT TO ADDRESS THESE -- CONCERNS AND PUT IN A CA -- INTO A FACT ONLY WOULD TIE THE HANDS OF BOTH OUR UNIVERSITIES INNER LABOR PARTNERS TO SOLVE THESE LABOR ISSUES GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANGELA KELLY ARE. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF STATE HEALTH POLICY FOR YOU SEE HEALTH THE MISSION OF YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEMS IS TO ADVANCE THE HEALTH OF SOCIETY. THROUGH HEALTH RELATED EDUCATION RESEARCH PATIENT CARE SERVICES. YOU SEE IS FIVE NATIONALLY RANKED ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS IN EIGHTEEN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS NEARLY 50% OF MEDICAL STUDENTS. AND MEDICAL RESIDENTS ARE TRAINED IN CALIFORNIA USED. HAMMERS ARE FINANCIALLY SELF SUSTAINING AND THE INCOME GENERATED BY THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO OUR PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. OUR MEDICAL CENTERS ARE PUBLIC SAFETY NET HOSPITALS THAT MUST KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN TO ALL PATIENTS IN SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUSLY ILL. PATIENTS NEEDING HIGHLY COMPLEX CARE EVERY HOSPITAL INCLUDING YOU SEE MUST HAVE MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE FLEXIBLE STAFFING TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN PATIENT SENSES AND ACUITY ON A DAILY. AND EVEN SHIFT BY SHIFT BASIS THAT DEMAND HIGHER LEVELS OF STAFFING. CHANGES IN PATIENT ACUITY AND SENSES REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO NOT ONLY PATIENT CARE STAFF SUCH AS VOCATIONAL NURSES PATIENT LIFT AND PATIENT TRANSPORTATION. TECH TRICK PATIENT TRANSPORT TECHNICIANS BUT ALSO TO CRITICAL OPERATIONS SUPPORT LIKE STAFF. STAFF LIKE JANITORS FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AT CETERA OUTBREAKS OF CONTAGIOUS ILLNESSES SURGES IN TRAUMA CASES AND CONTINUAL CHANGING CONDITIONS IN MIX OF ADMITTED PATIENTS CONSTRAIN EXISTING STAFF. THE RESTRICTIONS ESTABLISHED FOR A CA FOURTEEN WHAT IS WOULD PREVENT YOU SEE HOSPITALS FROM BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN THE STAFF THEY NEED. AND THIS KIND OF POLICY IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE STATE WE THINK ON ANY PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND WOULD FORCE AND AND IN PARTICULAR HOSPITALS WOULD FORCE. US TO DIVERT. AWAY FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOMS TRAUMA CENTERS AND COULD CAUSE US TO CANCEL AND RESCHEDULE IMPORTANT. MEDICAL PROCEDURES. LASTLY USUALLY HOSPITALS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED IN OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT POLICY DECISIONS LIKE ACA FOURTEEN CAN HAVE A LONG TERM EFFECT. ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY AS MEDICAL CENTERS IT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND THEREFORE WE DO OPPOSE. HOW MANY CANCER MANY OF ONE FIFTEEN ALL RIGHT ALL TRYING TO MY BEST? COMING AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T DUPLICATOR OR EVEN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE STATISTICS OF THE UC PROVIDER -- PROVIDERS JUST SAID WE'RE COMING OUT FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WHICH OBVIOUSLY PROVIDES THE CONTRACTS THAT -- THE YOU SEE -- UTILIZES FOR THE SUPPORT SERVICES I WOULD SUGGEST SUGGEST IT'S NOT JUST A LIMITATION THIS IS. POTENTIALLY A BAN ON THE USE OF CONTRACTING -- ONE BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GET STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR ANY CONTRACT INTO ONLY IF YOU DO THAT CAN YOU HAVE TEN DAYS OF EMPLOYMENT RIGHT UNDER THAT CONTRACT. I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT BUSINESSES OR GOING TO WAIT ONE FOR A POTENTIALLY A WHOLE LEGISLATIVE CYCLE TO GET APPROVAL FOR A CONTRACT OR TWO AFTER WAITING THAT LONG -- IN THAT TIME PERIOD TO ONLY WORK FOR THAT CONTRACT FOR TEN DAYS IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY AND AS SENATE FOR THE CON. COMPANY TO DO IT SO ESSENTIALLY I WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS A BAND AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE BILL WOULD EVEN WORK WITH RESPECT TO ONE OF THE PROVISIONS SAYS. THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CONTRACT REFORM SUPPORT SERVICES IT'S IT ON IT ANTICIPATED SPECIAL EVENT TO THE UNIVERSITY WITH THIRTY DAYS LIMITED NOTICE HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH THAN HAVING TO GO BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO GET APPROVAL FOR THAT CONTRACT AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT SITUATION THAT ON ANTICIPATED EVENT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SO I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE. SO WILL POTENTIALLY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR LOSE JOBS BUT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT OUR COMPANIES HAVE IS THE WORK FORCE IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EDUCATED AND DEDICATED WORK FORCE AND TO THE EXTENT YOU RESTRICT THE BUDGET OF THE UC. LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO DEVOTE -- FUNDING TO THE SOURCES OF EDUCATION PROFESSORS US SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION AND EFFICIENT A FISSION AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH HOW THAT WILL IMPACT OF THE GROWING AND I'D TRAINED WORKFORCE -- THAT WE RELY UPON SO FROM THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION I APOLOGIZE ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE NAME FILIATION POSITION. KELLY BROOKS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS AND WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. MAURICE RIDGES AND ON BEHALF. MASON AND DUE TO OUR CONCERNS -- FOR PATIENT SAFETY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY -- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS CONCERNS COMMENTS THOUGHTS EMOTIONS. DO WE MOVE THE BILL TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU IS THERE A SECOND THANK YOU. OF SO. FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO ADD ME ON AS A AS A CO AUTHOR. IF I HADN'T DONE IT ALREADY THANK YOU ARE BUT YEAH OKAY THIS IS FOR JUST MAKE SURE WHAT WILL MATTER. I MAY HAVE BEEN WAITING HE'S NOT YET BUT HE IS NOW YEAH I MAY HAVE BEEN WAITING. UNTIL YOU AT IT THE REAL PROBLEM. WHICH WAS GOING TO THE VOTERS. TO CHANGE THE TENURE OF A THE UC REGENTS WHICH I CONSIDERED A REAL PROBLEM. LOOK THAT THEY CAN OUTLAST THREE GOVERNORS INTO LEGISLATURE'S. ONLY KINGS QUEENS AND DICTATORS HAVE THAT MUCH. TENURE IN THE WORLD. AND SO THEY CAN IGNORE US. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO COME BACK TO US. THE TALK WITH HIS DAVID DONE IT IN THE PAST. THAT PARTY UC REGENTS. I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I WORK FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES I WAS WERE WITH. ONE SEVEN BROUGHT IN. NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN WE DID A MUCH BETTER JOB. THEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN AFTER YOU HIGHER TO MAKE THE LOWER COSTS WITH THE CHANGE ORDERS AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME IN LATER. AFTER FIVE TEN YEARS YOU'RE PAYING MORE THAN YOU DID WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BUT THAT'S NEVER INCORPORATED. AND MY POINT IT SHOULD BE ME BUT THERE'S NEVER INCORPORATED IN THE ANALYSIS IS USUALLY AT THE FRONT END THIS IS HOW MUCH WE SAFE. BUT NO ONE EVER DOES AN ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH THEY ULTIMATELY SPENT ON THE BACK IN. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT WRITING CONTRACTS AND WE HAVE TO DO CHANGE ORDERS ALL THE TIME I I USED TO WRITE CONTRACTS I KNOW I WOULD ALWAYS THAT GOOD. AND SO THE TAXPAYER ENDS UP PAYING MORE WHEN THEY HAD THE BEST GROUP WORKING FOR AT THAT TIME DOING THE WORK. AND EXPERIENCE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK AND SO I I KNOW ONLY COMMEND YOU BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT UP I'M GLAD. ESPECIALLY THE PART ABOUT COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE NO GOVERNMENTAL BODY. SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST. RUN AMOK AND NOT HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT TECHNICALLY THEY HAVE NO OVERSIGHT AT THE BORDER REGIONS AND THEY CAN JUST DO ANYTHING THEY WANT. AND I WISH WE HAD ADDED THAT HIT TO YOUR BILL THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM FOUR YEAR TERMS. SO THEY WOULD LEARN. HOW? TO TO LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE AND TAKING THEIR INPUT AND NOT JUST DO WHATEVER THEY FELT THEY WANTED TO DO AND SO I I WILL BE A YES. YES AND YES. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I AM I THINK IF WE ADDED THAT INTO THIS WE MIGHT VIOLATE THE SINGLE SUBJECT ROLE THAT I'M WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT WITH YOU IN A SEPARATE ACA I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I WHAT I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR -- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S CLEARLY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS. LIKE THAT -- IN SOME CASES CAN GET WORKED OUT AS BILLS GO FORTY SENATORS ON THE DETAILS I'M SURE IT'LL BE APPROPRIATELY BETTER AT THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE -- WHEN THAT TIME COMES -- I I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHCARE COMPETITIVENESS I AGREE WE HAVE TO DO MORE ON COST CONTAINMENT IN GENERAL IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO MAKE. OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS MORE COMPETITIVE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE AREA THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AND IT ALSO AGREED WITH THE SAME NUMBER. JONES SAWYER MY EXPERIENCE ON THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WHEN. WE LOST A LOT OF PUBLIC WORKERS AND WE OUTSOURCE A LOT OF OUR ON THAT NOT ONLY WILL BE PAYING MORE -- BUT WE WERE GETTING LESS OUT OF IT AND THAT WERE THAT DELTA WAS WAS PROFIT TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR. AND SO I THINK THERE IS A REALLY OF AMER PRIMER USING. A PUBLIC DOLLARS WE DO HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT WHERE THEY GO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THREE ONE QUALITY WORK AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT OUR WORKERS AND ABOUT THERE'S ABOUT. COST. FIFTY MEMBERS AND SENATORS -- THAT AS THIS BILL OF IT TO GET THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE I ADDED AS CO AUTHORS I'M HONORED TO BE ADDED AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL AND I'M VERY PLEASED THAT ARE -- VICE CHAIR AS WELL AS SUMMER DIEPPE ARE ALSO BEING ADDED AS CO AUTHORS TO SHOW THAT THIS TRULY IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO INSURING HIS ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND PROTECTION OF WORKERS AND SO -- WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE AND SO MEADOW SECTOR OF CULTURAL PLEASE ACTUALLY SOME OF HIS OFFICE PLEASE CLOSE I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CLOTHES OKAY UNLESS YOU LIKE TO READ THE NAMES OF ALL THE CO AUTHORS. WE'LL BE HERE FOR AWHILE THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE IT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE. QUESTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA I AGREE YOU. WILL I GET. YEP I GONZALEZ I I JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE THREE OF US THREE OF US HI. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SERVICE ALSO [inaudible] SENATOR HERTZBERG [inaudible] SB [inaudible] PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE PLEASE UPON. RUN INTO ANY OF OUR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS PLEASE SENATOR HERTZBERG. I HAVE A VERY ON THAT -- ONE SENATOR ESSENTIAL [inaudible] SB. TWO TWENTY NINE HELLO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. THANK YOU. OUR THIS BILL DEALS WITH WHISTLEBLOWERS I WAS HERE. A FEW YEARS AGO ON A WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTE AND I WANTED TO BRING THIS BECAUSE EVERY OFFICE IN THE STATE I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THAT LONG OF A TALK -- THE ALRIGHT I'M GONNA MAKE IT SHORT AND SWEET DOES YOUR NO THESE ARE JUST THE OUTLINE OF MY TALKING POINTS. BUT YOU KNOW THIS THESE REALLY STATES IN LARGE MEASURE THE CORE THE CORNER STONE PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE ASK EMPLOYERS TO HIM. LOOK AT THIS THERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE THAT'S OUTLINED IN RED THAT SAYS WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE PROTECTED. IT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO IMPLORED. TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES TO NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY BASICALLY TO TELL THE TRUTH. AND I SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOME TANGENTIAL AREA THE AS WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PAGES IN THE LABOR CALLED THIS INFORMS ONE OF THE BASIC ELEMENTS. AND SO A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS HERE SETTING UP A PROCESS AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE FOUND OUT AFTER TALKING SOME OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THE OTHER DAY. AND IT WOULD ONE OF THE PROCESS SEES AS TO ONCE THERE'S A FAULT ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE THAT THE FAULT. AND REDUCE IT TO A JUDGMENT IS WHAT WE'VE DONE IS HEADED WE'VE BASICALLY IN THIS MEASURE ADDED ON WHAT I DID A FEW YEARS AGO HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS TO MAKE THE PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT ONE IS A DEFAULT. IT'S EASIER FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENFORCE MORE QUICKLY. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. IT WASN'T TOO LONG THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AS STATED SO WHAT BY SENATOR HERTZBERG WE WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- WITH SB THREE OF SIX A FEW YEARS AGO OF WHICH WE WERE A CO SPONSOR THE MAIN. THING TO DO WAS MAKE THE PROCESS OF WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION SIMPLER BY GRANTING THEM THAT TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE AUTHORITY. TO INTERVENE BEFORE YEARS NEED TO GO BY IN A VERY LONG VERY EXPENSIVE DRAWN OUT COURT PROCESS TO GET. THEM THEIR JOBS BACK OR TO AND THE DISCRIMINATORY ACTIVITY IN PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS CASES AND WHAT WE FOUND AFTER THE BILL PASSED WAS THAT THERE WERE A FEW AREAS THAT NEEDED TO BE TWEAKED pPROCESS TO WORK. AS ENVISIONED ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMAL AS OPPOSED TO FORMAL HEARINGS COULD BE USED THOSE ARE ONES THAT. EMPLOYEE DEPUTY LABOR COMMISSIONER IS RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES THE DEAL SEIZE TEN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AS ARE THE EMPLOYER SO IT. TENDS TO JUST WORK BETTER FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IT WAS ALSO A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. THE THE FINAL ORDER CITATION IS DEVELOP TO THE BEST GUESS WAS THAT IT NEEDED TO GO BACK INTO THE COURT PROCESS WHICH IS KIND WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID THE FIRST PLACE SO. THIS JUST ALLOWS IN THE ARM THE DIVISION TO BETTER ENFORCE THE CITATIONS THEMSELVES RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO COURT. SO WE ARE DRIVE UP THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINA TREMELLA I'M AN ATTORNEY FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AS WELL AND I'M HERE TO PROVIDE ANY QUESTIONS AS REGARDING TO TECHNICAL FIXES.
