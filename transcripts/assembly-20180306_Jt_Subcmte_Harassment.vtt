SPRINT SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.608 region:rollup2
HOW? THE SUPREME COURT AND WHEN

BUT I HAVE TO SAY HERE AS A AS

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:44.084 region:rollup2
A.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:46.586 region:rollup2
AS A CAUTION I AM I AM NOT A

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:48.722 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED EXPERT. IN THE FIELD

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.790 region:rollup2

LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.893 region:rollup2

THESE ISSUES. YOU KNOW WITH

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:02.302 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE SEVERITY OF OF

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.737 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THAT IS ACTIONABLE.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:07.407 region:rollup2
THE WAY I SEE THIS IT'S REALLY

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:09.876 region:rollup2
ON ON ON A LARGE SPECTRUM.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:12.245 region:rollup2
BEGINNING WITH THE WORDS AND

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:14.481 region:rollup2
GESTURES.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:16.149 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT THAT. MAY

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.617 region:rollup2
OR MAY NOT INVOLVE.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.153 region:rollup2
ANY CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND AND

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:21.888 region:rollup2
MAYBE EVEN THE MAY NOT EVEN RISE

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:24.991 region:rollup2
TO THE LEVEL OF BEING.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:27.827 region:rollup2
ACTIONABLE IN A CIVIL CONTACTS.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:29.896 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY OUR PENAL CODE.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:32.098 region:rollup2
AND I CAN ONLY THINK OF A ONE OR

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:35.035 region:rollup2
TWO. A CRIMINAL STATUTES THAT

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:38.071 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH MAKING CRIMINAL.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:39.105 region:rollup2
OBJECTIONABLE WORDS AND TALK

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:44.444 region:rollup2
INCITING TO RIOT SOMETHING LIKE

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:45.512 region:rollup2
THAT. OF THE CRIMINAL. CODE.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.913 region:rollup2
BASICALLY FOCUS ON.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.115 region:rollup2
HARASSING THE TYPE OF ASSAULT

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:52.185 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. OF A TOUCHING OVER

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:55.922 region:rollup2
CLOSE UNDER CLOTHES. AND MORE

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:58.758 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL SEXUAL. CONDUCT. AND

00:05:55.922 --> 00:06:00.627 region:rollup2
WITH EACH A DEGREE. OF.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:02.562 region:rollup2
.

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:05.131 region:rollup2
HELLO HEIGHTENED OFFENSE OF

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:06.800 region:rollup2
COURSE THE PUNISHMENT. OF IS

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:10.003 region:rollup2
MORE STRINGENT.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.638 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS ALSO LOOK AT.

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.306 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THE AGE DIFFERENCE

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.541 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.276 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE IS A VIOLATION OF

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.277 region:rollup2
TRUST.

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:18.778 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE AN AREA OF

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.579 region:rollup2
SUPERIOR SUBORDINATE

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.081 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP CURRENTLY

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.515 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.050 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:25.485 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A QUID

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.754 region:rollup2
PRO QUO.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:30.523 region:rollup2
MADE. FOR CERTAIN.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:31.558 region:rollup2
CONCEPT. CONDUCT IN ORDER TO

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:34.427 region:rollup2
OBTAIN.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:36.730 region:rollup2
SORT OF A COURSE OF A CONSENT.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:40.267 region:rollup2
AND ONE FACTOR.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.068 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IS THE ALSO.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:44.204 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS THIS WHOLE QUESTION

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:46.106 region:rollup2
OF RETALIATION.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.807 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE MANY TIMES THE. IT'S

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:50.043 region:rollup2
NOT SO MUCH THE ACT IN QUESTION

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:51.678 region:rollup2
THAT GETS THE PERSON IN TROUBLE

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:53.913 region:rollup2
IT'S HOW THE COMPANY WITH

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:57.584 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL. RESPONSE TO THAT SO

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:59.786 region:rollup2
RETALIATION COMPLAINS. CLAIMS

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:02.822 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU GO THROUGH. THE

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:04.391 region:rollup2
LITERATURE IN THE LAW ARE ALSO A

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:07.294 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:09.362 region:rollup2
WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT. THE FACTORS

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:12.065 region:rollup2
IN IT MITIGATION.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:15.368 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE A MISTAKEN CONSENT.

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:17.037 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:19.673 region:rollup2
JUST THE WORDS NOT BEING THERE

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:21.408 region:rollup2
OF THE ACTUAL WHO EXPRESS WHICH

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:23.243 region:rollup2
PERSON WORDS OF CONSENT.

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:25.945 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF AGGRAVATION THE

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:28.548 region:rollup2
COURTS WOULD LOOK TO THE.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:30.717 region:rollup2
OF THE USE OF FORCE OF ANY TYPE

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:32.252 region:rollup2
OR A. TRANSPORTING SOMEONE IN

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:34.988 region:rollup2
THE KIDNAPPING KIND OF SITUATION

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.655 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE ALL. FACTORS THAT

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:37.991 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT WOULD ENHANCE OR

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:39.726 region:rollup2
MITIGATE A SENTENCE AND I THINK.

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:42.162 region:rollup2
WHEN A JUDGE LOOKS AT.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:43.596 region:rollup2
OF.

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:45.131 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF CONDUCT ON A

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:47.734 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM WE TAKE ALL THESE

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:50.603 region:rollup2
THINGS INTO. CONSIDERATION.

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:52.272 region:rollup2
NO SANCTIONS.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:54.774 region:rollup2
OF BOTH IN THE.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:55.442 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND ON THE STATE

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.676 region:rollup2
BAR.

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:59.379 region:rollup2
SCHEMES.

00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:02.449 region:rollup2
OF.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:03.917 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ISSUES OF THE.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.719 region:rollup2
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SANCTION I

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:07.620 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AND HOW DO YOU ARRIVE

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:09.489 region:rollup2
AT THAT? OF.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.925 region:rollup2
THE STAGE.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:13.660 region:rollup2
BOTH BOTH OF THOSE SCHEMES

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:16.563 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE MORE.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.565 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL LEISTON I THINK WHAT WE

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:19.766 region:rollup2
MAY BE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:23.303 region:rollup2
I'VE READ SOME LITERATURE ON HOW

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:25.038 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES HANDLE. OF.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:26.306 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.408 region:rollup2
WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE A

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:29.609 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:31.511 region:rollup2
THE SCHEMES IN BOTH THE

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:32.812 region:rollup2
PUNISHMENT.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.147 region:rollup2
AGAINST LAWYERS AND PROTECT

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.915 region:rollup2
AGAINST JUDGES ALL INVOLVE KIND

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:38.451 region:rollup2
OF.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:40.987 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INVESTIGATIONS. ANNA

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:42.655 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATIVE BODY. A COMMITTEE

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:45.358 region:rollup2
OR THE ENTIRE BODY.

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:45.959 region:rollup2
MAKING. A DETERMINATION OF WHAT

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.361 region:rollup2
AN APPROPRIATE SANCTION WOULD

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.196 region:rollup2
BE.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.831 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.601 region:rollup2
COURT IN WHICH I SERVED WAS

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.269 region:rollup2
REALLY THE SUPERVISING ENTITY.

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:58.972 region:rollup2
OVER ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE. AS

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:00.707 region:rollup2
WELL AS JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:03.176 region:rollup2
AT THE EXTREME THE PUNISHMENT

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:05.111 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DISBARMENT.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:06.446 region:rollup2
AT THE OTHER EXTREME THAT MIGHT

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:08.381 region:rollup2
BE JUST A PRIVATE.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:10.016 region:rollup2
A REPRIMAND.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.317 region:rollup2
UP NEXT WOULD BE A.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:14.154 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:16.689 region:rollup2
WRITTEN CENSURE REPUBLICA

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:19.292 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND OF REPRIMAND.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:22.095 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. TYPE OF SANCTION WOULD

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:24.030 region:rollup2
BE AN ACT. OF PROBATION.

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:24.597 region:rollup2
WITH A STATE SENTENCE OF

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.200 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION SAY THIRTY SIXTY

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:29.636 region:rollup2
DAYS.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.937 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LAWYER COULD NOT?

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:33.373 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:34.707 region:rollup2
ONCE THAT TERM WAS FULFILLED IN

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:36.042 region:rollup2
THE MATTER WOULD BE CLOSE.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:37.944 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO ACTUAL OF

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:40.046 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:41.448 region:rollup2
IN A IN A CONTEXT LIKE WHAT WERE

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:43.183 region:rollup2
YOU MAY BE CONSIDERING HERE A

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:46.286 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION MIGHT BE WITH OR

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:49.522 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PAY. OVER DEPRIVATION OF

ASSIGNMENTS THE BUDGET CUTS.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.962 region:rollup2
OF.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.665 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE THAT THAT THE.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:58.865 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SPEAKER

00:09:58.665 --> 00:09:59.899 region:rollup2
MIGHT.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:02.368 region:rollup2
.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:04.104 region:rollup2
CLOSE. AS I SAID THE ULTIMATE

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.370 region:rollup2
SANCTION IN BOTH OF THOSE GAMES

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.307 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.908 region:rollup2
DISBARMENT OR REMOVAL. FROM

FROM THE BENCH.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:12.679 region:rollup2
ALSO IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.714 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBATION REALLY RUNS THE

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:16.649 region:rollup2
GAMUT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:19.185 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF CONDUCT THAT.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:22.188 region:rollup2
IS BEING CONSIDERED.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:25.525 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE. ETHICAL TRAINING

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:27.260 region:rollup2
WOULD BE. OF SIGNIFICANT.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:29.062 region:rollup2
OF TRAINING WHICH IS MANNED

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.631 region:rollup2
MANDATORY ANYWAY IN THE STATE OF

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:33.833 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ON.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.602 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.470 region:rollup2
BULLRING BULL BULLYING.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:39.038 region:rollup2
ANGER MANAGEMENT. SENSITIVITY

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.274 region:rollup2
TRAINING ROOM THE WHOLE GAMUT

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:43.143 region:rollup2
WHATEVER. AND THIS WOULD APPLY

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:45.178 region:rollup2
IN A CRIMINAL CONTEXT CASES AS

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:47.147 region:rollup2
WELL WERE AN INDIVIDUAL'S PLACED

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:48.081 region:rollup2
ON PROBATION. TYPICAL CASE WOULD

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.048 region:rollup2
BE IN A DRIVING UNDER THE

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:51.751 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE CASE THEY WOULD HAVE

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:52.085 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETE SOME KIND OF OFF THE

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.853 region:rollup2
WHOLE SCHOOL.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:56.256 region:rollup2
MEANING.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.690 region:rollup2
I AM VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:59.659 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.061 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THE WHOLE IDEA OF

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.897 region:rollup2
PREVENTION. IS VERY MUCH AT THE

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.865 region:rollup2
FOUR.

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:06.366 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THE NINTH CIRCUIT

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:09.002 region:rollup2
AND ALSO OF THE DISTRICT

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:10.937 region:rollup2
COURT'S.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.172 region:rollup2
HAVE A PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:15.041 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR NEW

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:17.143 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND ALSO FOR NEW.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:18.611 region:rollup2
NEW JUDGES. I KNOW THE NINTH

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:22.649 region:rollup2
CIRCUIT HAS A DESIGNATED

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:23.550 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN. TO HANDLE. COMPLAINTS

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:27.787 region:rollup2
UNDER CERTAIN.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.987 region:rollup2
THE. REPORTING PROTOCOLS. OF.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.689 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:31.591 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:34.160 region:rollup2
JUST GETTING BACK BRIEFLY TO THE

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:35.995 region:rollup2
SANCTIONS ON SENTENCING SCHEMES.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.764 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY IN A CASE. IN A

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.865 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CASE A JUDGE WOULD NOT

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:40.333 region:rollup2
GET ANY KIND OF IN THE PENDING

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.601 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AS YOU WOULD IN

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:44.070 region:rollup2
THE CORPORATE. OR PUBLIC

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:44.771 region:rollup2
CONTACTS WOULD GET A PROVISIONAL

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.973 region:rollup2
OFFICER'S REPORT THAT WOULD

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:48.308 region:rollup2
DETAIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:49.208 region:rollup2
OFFENSE THE GRAVITY OF THE

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:51.678 region:rollup2
OFFENSE.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:54.380 region:rollup2
OF PRIOR VIOLATIONS WOULD WEIGH

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:56.082 region:rollup2
VERY HEAVILY. AND GENERALLY

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.616 region:rollup2
EVERY SYSTEM I'VE SEEN HAS A

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:59.118 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE. DISCIPLINARY

00:11:56.616 --> 00:12:01.588 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:03.790 region:rollup2
MAYBE FOR THE CONDUCT THAT IS

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:04.624 region:rollup2
NOT SO AGGRAVATED.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.627 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME OFFENSE.

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:09.262 region:rollup2
THE.

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:11.231 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF CENSURE OF THE

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:13.333 region:rollup2
MOVING UNDER SUSPENSION AMOUNT

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:15.201 region:rollup2
TO DISBARMENT SO THAT.

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:17.003 region:rollup2
THAT WEIGHS VERY HEAVILY. WHEN A

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:18.571 region:rollup2
JUDGE LOOKS AT A CASE.

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:20.907 region:rollup2
AND IS TRYING TO FASHION AN

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:22.141 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE REMEDY. OTHERS ALSO

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.977 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF A PERFORMANCE ON

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.979 region:rollup2
PROBATION.

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:27.947 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEONE A BREAK.

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:29.215 region:rollup2
OF THAT I JUST SAW THE SALOONS

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:31.017 region:rollup2
THE COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SOMEONE

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:32.352 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHEN THEY DON'T COMPLY

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:35.188 region:rollup2
WITH THE TERMS OF PROBATION

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:36.122 region:rollup2
THAT'S YET ANOTHER OFFENSE. FOR

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:39.459 region:rollup2
WHICH ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:42.295 region:rollup2
CAN BE IMPOSED. BY THE BIG THE

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:44.063 region:rollup2
ISSUE RIGHT NOW. AS I SEE IT

00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:45.732 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE THAT THE.

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:47.467 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON ON CAMPUSES

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:49.168 region:rollup2
AND REALLY I THINK IT APPLIES TO

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.303 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:53.072 region:rollup2
IS THE WHOLE NOTION OF DUE

00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:54.340 region:rollup2
PROCESS. AND THE HALLMARK OF THE

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.109 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS SINCE TIME

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.112 region:rollup2
IMMEMORIAL IN THIS COUNTRY HAS

00:12:56.109 --> 00:13:00.380 region:rollup2
BEEN NOTICE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:04.717 region:rollup2
TO BE HEARD.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:06.152 region:rollup2
THE. BROAD SORT OF A CATEGORY.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.819 region:rollup2
WHAT PROCESSES DO IN A

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:09.489 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR?

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:11.724 region:rollup2
CASE. CERTAINLY NOTICE WOULD

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:14.494 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE DETAILING THE

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:16.429 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS OF THE ALLEGATION.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:18.197 region:rollup2
IT RAISES SOME SENSITIVITIES AS

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:20.833 region:rollup2
TO CONFIDENTIALITY AND. THE

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:22.835 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS OF A COMPLAINANT.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.604 region:rollup2
TO REALLY THE.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:25.038 region:rollup2
HE'LL COME OUT AND BE PUBLIC

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:27.340 region:rollup2
WITH HER WITH THEIR.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:28.641 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.576 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE DUE

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.845 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS ACCESS TO WITNESS

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:35.081 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS AND DOCUMENTS AFFORD

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:37.183 region:rollup2
THAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:40.687 region:rollup2
TO THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED OF

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:41.988 region:rollup2
A. ANY KIND OF HARASSMENT. TO BE

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:44.724 region:rollup2
ABLE TO EXAMINE.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:46.025 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS AND ANY DOCUMENTS

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:47.427 region:rollup2
AND WHATEVER IS IN. IN THE

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:48.728 region:rollup2
RECORD.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:50.697 region:rollup2
ALSO OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:52.398 region:rollup2
WOULD INCLUDE.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:53.533 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:55.134 region:rollup2
AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDING

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:57.136 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR AND ALSO TO THE

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:59.505 region:rollup2
JUDICATA BODY. WHETHER THAT'S A

00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:01.007 region:rollup2
SPECIAL COMMITTEE THAT'S MAKING

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:03.109 region:rollup2
REPORT TO THE FINAL.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.544 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATIVE A BODY OR SOMETHING

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:06.079 region:rollup2
ELSE BUT.

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.880 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LITERATURE SPEAKS TO

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:09.882 region:rollup2
THE.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.417 region:rollup2
FACT FINDING THE.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:13.152 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP BEING

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:15.254 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM THE JUDICATA FROM

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:17.924 region:rollup2
BODY. ODOR TENDS TO BE THERE

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:19.359 region:rollup2
WOULD TEND TO BE A CONFLICT OF

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.527 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:24.197 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BOTH A FINDER OF FACT.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:25.898 region:rollup2
AND A ANY JUROR IN A SENSE.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.633 region:rollup2
WELL THE OTHER AREA THAT I THINK

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.968 region:rollup2
IS VERY SENSITIVE. IS THE WHOLE

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:30.770 region:rollup2
AREA AND THIS IS IN OUR IN OUR

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:32.772 region:rollup2
SIXTH AMENDMENT. RIGHT TO

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.307 region:rollup2
CONFRONT AND CROSS EXAMINE

00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:37.343 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AT SOME TRYING TO.

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:39.345 region:rollup2
IN OUR US. CONSTITUTION.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:41.481 region:rollup2
OF.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:42.648 region:rollup2
THE COURTS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:44.650 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND VERY

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:46.786 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE CASES I CAN SPEAK TO

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.489 region:rollup2
CHILD MOLESTATION CASES WERE.

00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.989 region:rollup2
THE LAW HAS DEVELOPED TO WHERE

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.424 region:rollup2
THERE CAN BE VIDEOTAPED

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:53.860 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY.

00:14:51.424 --> 00:14:56.395 region:rollup2
A SCREEN BEING USED TO BLOCK.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.797 region:rollup2
BE COMPLAINING FROM SEEING THE

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:59.065 region:rollup2
RESPONDENT.

00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:00.666 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY BEING GIVEN IN

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:03.102 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ROOMS ARE DIFFERENT

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.637 region:rollup2
WAYS OF HANDLING. OF THOSE TYPES

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:07.473 region:rollup2
OF SITUATIONS.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:09.242 region:rollup2
ALSO TO PRESERVE THE THE NOTION

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:11.878 region:rollup2
OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:12.645 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY. AN EDUCATED BODY

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:14.714 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THE OPTION HAVING AN

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:16.048 region:rollup2
OPEN. OR CLOSED HEARING

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:17.750 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN IN IN JUVENILE

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:20.052 region:rollup2
CASES ARE CLOSED HEARINGS UP

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.622 region:rollup2
UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY IF THERE'S

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.822 region:rollup2
CONSENT OPEN UP. OF THE COURT

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:24.791 region:rollup2
ROOM.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:27.193 region:rollup2
OF.

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:29.262 region:rollup2
SO FINALLY I WOULD SAY THE B.

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:31.864 region:rollup2
FINDINGS THAT ARE MADE.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:34.267 region:rollup2
UP BY THE JUDICATA BODY SHOULD

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:36.035 region:rollup2
BE DETAILED. AND SUPPORTED BY

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:37.270 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE AND SHOULD SUPPORT

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:40.006 region:rollup2
THE CONCLUSION.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:42.975 region:rollup2
OF THAT EDUCATED OF THE BODY.

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:44.911 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:46.379 region:rollup2
ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS.

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:47.513 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER SIMILAR KINDS OF

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:49.282 region:rollup2
CASES ON THE PUNISHMENT.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:50.550 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:53.519 region:rollup2
WAS IMPOSED ON THOSE EARLIER

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.721 region:rollup2
CASES IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:59.225 region:rollup2
A BALANCE AND BELIEVE ME.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:16:00.693 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY. TO DO OF

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:03.162 region:rollup2
MAIL AS A JUDGE YOU TRY TO YOU

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:05.198 region:rollup2
TRY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:07.066 region:rollup2
BUT EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT AND THE

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:08.568 region:rollup2
FACTS ARE ALWAYS. VERY DIFFERENT

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:10.036 region:rollup2
BUT IN YOUR OWN MIND YOU TRY TO

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:12.872 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:14.841 region:rollup2
AND ARRIVE AT A AN APPROPRIATE.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:16.375 region:rollup2
SENTENCE.

00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:17.510 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THE FINDINGS ARE YOU

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.978 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT IS THE THE BURDEN OF

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.480 region:rollup2
PROOF.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.048 region:rollup2
GENERALLY IN CIVIL CASES OF

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.282 region:rollup2
COURSE IT'S A BY PREPONDERANCE

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:24.517 region:rollup2
OF THE EVIDENCE IS SLIGHTLY MORE

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:26.185 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:28.054 region:rollup2
ON ONE SIDE AS OPPOSED TO THE

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:29.755 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:31.190 region:rollup2
IN CRIMINAL CASES OF COURSE IT'S

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:32.892 region:rollup2
A PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.827 region:rollup2
DOUBT.

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:35.661 region:rollup2
AND ENTER IN IN BETWEEN. THERE'S

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.797 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED CLEAR AND

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:39.565 region:rollup2
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT DOESN'T

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.966 region:rollup2
APPLY THAT OFTEN BUT IT'S.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:42.335 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:44.971 region:rollup2
THE ADJUDICATIVE FOR THE

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:47.373 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS FIRMLY CONVINCED.

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:49.775 region:rollup2
THAT THE EVIDENCE A.

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:51.410 region:rollup2
WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF SOME KIND OF.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:52.812 region:rollup2
FINDING.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.313 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IN SOME SITUATIONS

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:56.716 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVERITY OF

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:58.117 region:rollup2
THE OFFENSE LIKE DISBARMENT

00:16:56.716 --> 00:17:00.486 region:rollup2
REMOVE HOME OFFICE.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:03.890 region:rollup2
US SOMEBODY'S BY USE THAT MORE.

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:07.360 region:rollup2
STRINGENT. BURDEN OF PROOF.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:10.062 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THAT WOULD BE.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.064 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF UNANIMITY.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:14.867 region:rollup2
AND THAT IN SOME WAY.

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:15.468 region:rollup2
MAY ALL. BERMAIN NULLIFY WITH

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.036 region:rollup2
THE REALLY THE BURDEN OF PROOF

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:19.305 region:rollup2
IS.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:21.574 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A PANEL OF OF THE.

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:23.009 region:rollup2
OF THREE LET'S SAY AS THE FINAL

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:26.312 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATIVE BODY.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:27.580 region:rollup2
YOU MAY WANT. TO CONSIDER.

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:29.849 region:rollup2
EITHER UNANIMITY OR SUPER

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.118 region:rollup2
MAJORITY WHICH I THINK IS IS THE

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.619 region:rollup2
GENERAL RULE. OF. THE FOR THE

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:36.322 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO TWO OUT

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:38.057 region:rollup2
OF THREE. IN CIVIL CASES ON

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:39.025 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES. IT'S

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.293 region:rollup2
NINE OUT OF TWELVE OR THREE

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:40.860 region:rollup2
QUARTERS.

00:17:40.293 --> 00:17:43.896 region:rollup2
SO YOU SEE THAT SINCE THINGS

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.832 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:48.234 region:rollup2
SO VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:50.269 region:rollup2
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OR TO

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.937 region:rollup2
AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY AS SOME

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:53.539 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY.

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:55.775 region:rollup2
OF.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:57.476 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE. AROUND BURDEN OF

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:59.178 region:rollup2
PROOF AROUND A PREPONDERANCE OF

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.580 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE WOULD SEEM TO BE

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:03.449 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL RULE.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:05.017 region:rollup2
AND THE MAJORITY. OR SUPER

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:10.456 region:rollup2
MAJORITY.

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:13.059 region:rollup2
OF CONCLUSION. BY THE GOVERNING

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:14.427 region:rollup2
BODY. WOULD BE. I THINK

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:15.594 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY. IN

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.863 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE TALKING BOUT

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:19.532 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION OR DISBARMENT WITH A

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.833 region:rollup2
SEVERITY DEFENSES ARE MUCH.

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.768 region:rollup2
GREATER.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:24.437 region:rollup2
AGAIN BEARING IN MIND WHAT I

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:26.172 region:rollup2
SAID EARLIER ABOUT HAVING A.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.940 region:rollup2
A COMPARATIVE THE REASONING

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:29.976 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.710 region:rollup2
IMPOSE AN AWESOME MINUS SIMILAR

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:32.178 region:rollup2
CASES.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.280 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:36.215 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.650 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS SINCE.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:40.086 region:rollup2
AND WHEN ONE SENSE I WAS AN

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.686 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIAL ON THE BALLOT

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:41.587 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE TIMES AND SAY THE

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:44.023 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:46.559 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.460 region:rollup2
AS AN INDEPENDENT THE. BRANCH OF

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.295 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT I THINK THE COURTS

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.530 region:rollup2
TEND TO DIFFER.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.965 region:rollup2
BUT I'M I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON ON

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.468 region:rollup2
ELECTION LAW THIS ONE OF A. OF

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:57.169 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:59.972 region:rollup2
BUT OVER TIME I THINK. THE

00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:01.440 region:rollup2
COURTS REALLY FEEL THAT.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:03.409 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SHOULD

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.278 region:rollup2
REALLY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:08.180 region:rollup2
OWN RULES. ANNA SO N. AS LONG AS

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:09.649 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.485 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:14.286 region:rollup2
THAT IS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.721 region:rollup2
I THINK COURTS ARE NOT GOING TO

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.590 region:rollup2
INTERCEDE.

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:19.358 region:rollup2
I THINK A THE SENSES I SEE IT IS

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.528 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:26.332 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:26.866 region:rollup2
THE. CALL. FOR SOMEONE TO BE

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.567 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY REMOVED FROM

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:31.670 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:32.872 region:rollup2
OF THAT MAY BE SOMETHING FOR THE

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.306 region:rollup2
COLLECTORS THE ELECTORATE TO

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:36.342 region:rollup2
DECIDE.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:37.777 region:rollup2
OF.

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:40.946 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS ARE GOING TO I

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:44.550 region:rollup2
THINK IN MOST INSTANCES DIFFER.

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:46.285 region:rollup2
TWO OF. THE DECISIONS.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.254 region:rollup2
OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:50.222 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE ONE OF ITS MEMBERS.

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:53.893 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT LISTEN

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:56.128 region:rollup2
I'M SURE. STAFF COULD FIND.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:57.396 region:rollup2
A CATALOG OF CASES ACROSS THE

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:59.031 region:rollup2
COUNTRY ON HOW YOU DEAL. WITH

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:00.1000 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:02.768 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK AS LONG AS THERE'S A

00:20:00.1000 --> 00:20:05.237 region:rollup2
MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS AND

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:07.907 region:rollup2
FAIRNESS. BUT ONE CASE I THINK I

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:09.575 region:rollup2
SAW. IN THE MEMO THAT WAS

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:10.576 region:rollup2
CIRCULATED TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:12.378 region:rollup2
KNOW DEALT WITH THREE

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:13.713 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS WHEN CALIFORNIA BACK

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:15.281 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN OH FIVE WHO ACCEPTED

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.949 region:rollup2
BRIBES.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:18.784 region:rollup2
AND WITHIN A MATTER A COUPLE

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:21.020 region:rollup2
MONTHS THEY WERE MOVED IN.

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:23.255 region:rollup2
THE THE COURT SAID SOMETHING TO

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.057 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT AS LONG AS THE.

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:27.293 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOLLOWED ITS RULES

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:29.128 region:rollup2
THAT'S ENOUGH TO PROCESS. SO DUE

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:30.930 region:rollup2
PROCESS SYMBOL TO PROCEDURAL

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:32.231 region:rollup2
SENSE.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.667 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS IN A SUBSTANTIVE

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:37.203 region:rollup2
SENSE WHAT'S FAIR.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:39.972 region:rollup2
REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT. IS NOT

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:42.074 region:rollup2
REALLY FIXED. IN THE LOFT IT'S

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.808 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE USE

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.778 region:rollup2
WE'LL YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:47.980 region:rollup2
IT. BUT IT GOES BACK TO YOU KNOW

00:20:45.778 --> 00:20:50.516 region:rollup2
WAS THIS A FAIR PROCESS WAS THE

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.751 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:20:50.516 --> 00:20:53.819 region:rollup2
BE HEARD.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:56.689 region:rollup2
WAS THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:59.425 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT. OF.

00:20:56.689 --> 00:21:03.028 region:rollup2
AND THE WAS THEIR DECISION.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:03.462 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY BASED ON.

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:04.797 region:rollup2
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.331 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED.

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:08.200 region:rollup2
BY SOME LEVEL OF BURDEN OF

00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:10.269 region:rollup2
PROOF.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.104 region:rollup2
I THINK DOING THAT I THINK THAT

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:13.105 region:rollup2
THE.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:15.107 region:rollup2
THE COURT WOULD VERY LIKELY FIND

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:17.309 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROCESS THAT WAS DUE

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:19.211 region:rollup2
WAS INDEED RENDERED.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:21.213 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:23.082 region:rollup2
OVERALL SORT OF GENERAL COMMENTS

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:24.583 region:rollup2

SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU'LL WANT

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:02.588 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER LATER RATHER THAN NOW

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:04.423 region:rollup2
SO I'LL GIVE YOU THAT OPTION.

00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:05.791 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THAT THE MOST OF

00:22:04.423 --> 00:22:08.260 region:rollup2
THE TIME WITH DUE PROCESS

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:09.929 region:rollup2
INCLUDES. THE ACCUSED BEING ABLE

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.430 region:rollup2
TO REVIEW SORT OF THE CASE

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:13.332 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM BY LOOKING AT THE

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.800 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION NOW WE DO NOT

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:16.535 region:rollup2
ALLOW THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY SO

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.172 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE. THE ACCUSES

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:20.606 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWED AND THEY MIGHT BE

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.874 region:rollup2
ASKED ABOUT ABOUT.

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:22.641 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY OF OTHER WITNESSES BUT

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:25.711 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GIVEN THE

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:28.013 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT. THAT

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:31.016 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY I BELIEVE OUT OF.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:32.618 region:rollup2
DESIRE TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.019 region:rollup2
OF WITNESSES AND I'M JUST

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:35.688 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:37.790 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AND AND IF

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:39.391 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A FATAL

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.293 region:rollup2
FLAW OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN.

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:43.195 region:rollup2
SORT OF WORK AROUND BASED ON THE

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:45.164 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTIVE DESIRES YEAH I

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:47.366 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S A FATAL FLAW TO

00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:48.868 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH BUT I THINK SOME KIND

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.768 region:rollup2
OF SUMMARY OF THE TESTIMONY.

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:51.737 region:rollup2
IT COULD EVEN BE ANONYMOUS I

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:52.705 region:rollup2
SUPPOSE.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:54.840 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CYNIC

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:56.275 region:rollup2
QUINTANA OF DUE PROCESS TO

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.178 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:22:56.275 --> 00:23:00.212 region:rollup2
OF REVIEW THE ACTUAL STATEMENTS

00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:01.647 region:rollup2
AND DISCLOSE THE IDENTITY LOTUS

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.083 region:rollup2
SOON THAT MANY TIMES THE

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:06.185 region:rollup2
COMPLAINANTS ARE ANONYMOUS. AND

00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:08.354 region:rollup2
WISH TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:09.955 region:rollup2
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE. UP VERY

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:11.357 region:rollup2
MUCH INTUITION TO FIGURE OUT WHO

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.025 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON MIGHT BE FROM A SET

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:14.827 region:rollup2
OF FACTS.

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:16.629 region:rollup2
SO IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:18.197 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S A FABLE

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:20.432 region:rollup2
FLAW BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT.

00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:21.033 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT. YOU KNOW I'VE

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:23.135 region:rollup2
SEEN THIS DEALT WITH A GRIN

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:25.137 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CASES INVOLVING

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:27.573 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS.

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:29.742 region:rollup2
IS THE THE.

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:33.045 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS ATTORNEY.

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:35.214 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GIVEN ACCESS IN UNDER

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:36.815 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. TO A

00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:38.417 region:rollup2
STATEMENT FOR SUMMARY.

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:40.419 region:rollup2
OF WITHOUT HAVING THE ACTUAL

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.820 region:rollup2
CLIENT.

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:43.389 region:rollup2
SEE THOSE STATEMENTS. SO IT'S

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.725 region:rollup2
REALLY.

00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:48.460 region:rollup2

EXAMPLE YOU GAVE UP BEFORE THE

COURT SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:23.562 region:rollup2
ALL THE EXAMPLES FROM

DISBARMENT.

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:28.267 region:rollup2
ON DOWN BOMB ARE THOSE PRE

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:32.204 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED IS THAT UP TO THE

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:35.808 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATIVE BODY TO FIGURE OUT.

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:36.608 region:rollup2
WHAT FITS WHAT SCENARIO?

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.910 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN TO KIND OF?

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:39.478 region:rollup2
GOOD INTERESTING QUESTION KIND

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.579 region:rollup2
OF A COMBINATION OF BOTH BECAUSE

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:43.515 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:45.017 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE FACTORS IN

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:46.852 region:rollup2
AGGRAVATION.

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:48.487 region:rollup2
OF THAT WOULD PERTAIN TO AN

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:51.123 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING OFFENSE THOSE WOULD

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:52.691 region:rollup2
BE SET OUT IN STATUTE IN MARKS.

00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:54.259 region:rollup2
IN RULES OF COURT AND THIS IS

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:56.662 region:rollup2
BOTH IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IN

00:24:54.259 --> 00:25:01.700 region:rollup2
THE IN THE STATE. OF SYSTEM SO

00:24:56.662 --> 00:25:02.234 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE. SET OUT. I WANTED

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.003 region:rollup2
THEY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:06.205 region:rollup2
THE SPECTRUM CONCERN THE

00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:07.873 region:rollup2
SEVERITY OF THE.

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:09.641 region:rollup2
OF THE CONDUCT.

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:10.676 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE CIVIL LAW IS

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:12.511 region:rollup2
QUITE CLEAR ON THIS I MEAN IF

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:14.747 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:17.149 region:rollup2
NO ONE REALLY AGGRAVATED.

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:18.650 region:rollup2
INSTANCE WITH NO PRIORS THAT'S

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:21.053 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AND I ULTIMATE SANCTION.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.888 region:rollup2
OF THE NOTION OF A PROGRESSIVE

00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:24.857 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE STARTING OUT WITH THE

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.391 region:rollup2
LIGHTEST SENTENCE WOULD APPLY

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.960 region:rollup2
WORDS MERITED WHERE THE NO

00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:29.194 region:rollup2
PRIOR.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.930 region:rollup2
OFFENSES AND THEN.

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:35.434 region:rollup2
IN HIM HARASSMENT WORKPLACE

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.968 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CASES OR SOMETHING

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:36.235 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS STRAIGHT STRAIGHT

00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:38.837 region:rollup2
COMMENT.

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:40.939 region:rollup2
A STRAY COMMENT CLUB MIGHT NOT

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:43.108 region:rollup2
EVEN BE ACTIONABLE.

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:45.110 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT'S SEVERE ENOUGH AND IT

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:46.979 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:50.549 region:rollup2
THEN YOU HAVE AN ACTIONABLE CASE

00:25:46.979 --> 00:25:52.217 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN THE SPECTRUM OF A.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:54.186 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN IN THE

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:55.954 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE MEAN JUST WITH ALL

00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:58.457 region:rollup2
OVER THE PLACE. BUT I JUST WANT

00:25:55.954 --> 00:26:01.126 region:rollup2
TO EMPHASIZE THAT WILL ONE.

00:25:58.457 --> 00:26:03.462 region:rollup2

SOON.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:52.204 region:rollup2
TO GET INTO THAT.

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:54.006 region:rollup2
EVEN AT THE MIDDLE MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:56.642 region:rollup2
LEVEL I WOULD SAY.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:59.111 region:rollup2

YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA AND ON THE OUR

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:10.122 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT. I SINCERELY

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:11.356 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE OUT ALL OF THEM

00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:13.725 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY AS AN ATTORNEY.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:15.527 region:rollup2
IT WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:17.563 region:rollup2
SEVERITY OF CONDUCT MY QUESTION

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:19.631 region:rollup2
HAS TO DO WITH THE THE. THE

00:28:17.563 --> 00:28:23.168 region:rollup2
POSITIONS OF THE PERPETRATOR AND

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:24.570 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM. ARE ONE THING IS TO

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:26.238 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THEM.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.006 region:rollup2
THE HARASSMENT BETWEEN TWO

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:30.108 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS BUT WHEN THE

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:32.945 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR IS IN A POSITION OF

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:36.415 region:rollup2
POWER OVER THE VICTIM.

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:38.250 region:rollup2
HOW IT WORKS?

00:28:36.415 --> 00:28:40.452 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.487 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT THAT SORT OF A CASE

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:43.689 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HANDLED?

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:45.457 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK GO WITH A PERSON IN

00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:46.825 region:rollup2
POWER.

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.326 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT IS REALLY NOT A

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:50.796 region:rollup2
VALID. CONSENT IT'S IT'S

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:52.998 region:rollup2
COERCED.

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:55.267 region:rollup2
IN MOST INSTANCES AND THE FACT

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:56.301 region:rollup2
OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE NEED.

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:57.803 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE NEED IT THE MOST

00:28:56.301 --> 00:29:00.706 region:rollup2
TRAINING OTHER PEOPLE IN POWER

00:28:57.803 --> 00:29:02.608 region:rollup2
WHETHER LEGISLATOR A CHARGER.

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:04.343 region:rollup2
CORPORATE EXECUTIVE SO. YOU KNOW

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:06.678 region:rollup2
TRUE TRUE CONSENT UNDER THOSE

00:29:04.343 --> 00:29:07.946 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES IS VERY SUSPECT IN

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.714 region:rollup2
MY VIEW.

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:11.516 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE A

00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:13.852 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN AGGRAVATION.

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:15.654 region:rollup2
BUT SOMEONE VIOLATED A POSITION

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:19.825 region:rollup2
OF TRUST OVER THAT.

00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:21.560 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM.

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:22.861 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED BY THE

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.596 region:rollup2
CHAIR AND THE COACH HERE

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:26.164 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY HAVING TO DO WITH

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:28.867 region:rollup2
THE ALLEGATIONS OR THE EVIDENCE.

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:31.003 region:rollup2
IF.

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:32.704 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS ONE THING IS DURING

00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:35.340 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATIONS TO HOW MUCH

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:36.208 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS GIVEN. TO TO THE

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.843 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR.

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:40.112 region:rollup2
.

00:29:37.843 --> 00:29:42.914 region:rollup2
IF NOW THERE IS A HEARING A DUE

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:46.184 region:rollup2
PROCESS HEARING. TO EXPEL THEM

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:48.620 region:rollup2
TO SPEND THEM. AT THAT POINT.

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:50.422 region:rollup2
SHOULD EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.357 region:rollup2
FORT TO ALLOW FOR TRUE DUE

00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:53.492 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES CROSS

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:56.528 region:rollup2
EXAMINATION.

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:58.563 region:rollup2
AND EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE

00:29:56.528 --> 00:30:00.399 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD POINT AND

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:02.301 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:05.604 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
V. CONTEMPLATED THE SEVERITY THE

00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:09.508 region:rollup2
WELL THE THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.508 region:rollup2
OFFENSE THE CONTEMPLATED

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
I THINK MORE DUE PROCESS IS DUE.

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:16.348 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT EXTENDS TO

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.150 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE FULL STATEMENTS OF

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:20.118 region:rollup2
THE WITNESSES.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.820 region:rollup2
UP IS ANOTHER QUESTION IT VERY

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.888 region:rollup2
WELL MAY.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.691 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHEN YOU'RE ON THE

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:27.025 region:rollup2
ON THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE. I

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.927 region:rollup2
THINK AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:32.097 region:rollup2
MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS.

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:34.833 region:rollup2
OF. IT'S BEEN PROBABLY NEEDS IT

00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:36.568 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGOR. BUT THE

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:37.903 region:rollup2
MORE HE GET INTO THE.

00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:39.004 region:rollup2
THE HEAVIER SANCTIONS.

00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:41.807 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:42.407 region:rollup2
OF.

00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:43.608 region:rollup2
FIRST WHILE THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.810 region:rollup2
LAWYERS UP TO THE LAWYERS ARE

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:46.244 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE WANTING THAT

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.448 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:50.749 region:rollup2
OF SO THAT THE I THINK I THINK

00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:52.517 region:rollup2
MORE DUE PROCESS WOULD BE DO IT

00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:53.151 region:rollup2
ON A.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.320 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PUNISHMENT IS GONNA BE

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:57.322 region:rollup2
MORE SEVERE?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.291 region:rollup2
IN MY MY. LAST QUESTION.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:31:02.527 region:rollup2
.

00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:04.730 region:rollup2
HAD UNDER DUE PROCESS ALSO IS.

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:06.965 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.067 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM OF DISCIPLINE FOR LACK

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:10.635 region:rollup2
OF A BETTER WORD. BUT IN ONE

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:13.004 region:rollup2
INSTANCE PREPONDERANCE OF THE

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:16.174 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE COULD BE SUFFICIENT.

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:18.310 region:rollup2
BUT. A HIGHER BURDEN WHEN THE

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:20.278 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE IS GOING TO BE MORE

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.713 region:rollup2
SEVERE.

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.781 region:rollup2
COMING UP TO.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:24.116 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT CLEAR

00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:27.753 region:rollup2
CONVINCING AND.

00:31:24.116 --> 00:31:29.388 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THE THE UNANIMITY OR

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:31.289 region:rollup2
SUPER MAJORITY.

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:33.658 region:rollup2
SO DO DO YOU FEEL THAT DEPENDING

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:36.461 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THE DSCIPLINE IS GOING

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:37.996 region:rollup2
TO BE THEN THE PREPONDERANCE OR

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:40.832 region:rollup2
THE THE THE THE.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:42.100 region:rollup2
ROOF IS GOING TO BE.

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:45.971 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO VERY DEPART

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.638 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE THE THE.

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.440 region:rollup2
THE FINAL DISCIPLINE IS GOING TO

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:51.276 region:rollup2
BE. YOU KNOW I I THINK YOU CAN

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.211 region:rollup2
HAVE IT ANY KIND OF SYSTEM. I

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.446 region:rollup2
THINK PREPONDERANCE IS PROBABLY

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:56.448 region:rollup2
GOOD ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:58.383 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE MORE AGGRAVATED THE

00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:59.317 region:rollup2
SANCTION.

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:01.353 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU WANT SOMETHING LIKE

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:03.221 region:rollup2
A SUPER MAJORITY.

00:32:01.353 --> 00:32:05.023 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW CRIMINAL CASES IT'S

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:07.025 region:rollup2
A UNANIMOUS JURY.

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:08.627 region:rollup2
A VERDICT.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:10.796 region:rollup2
IN CIVIL CASES IT'S IT'S NINE

00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:12.597 region:rollup2
OUT OF TWELVE.

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:13.799 region:rollup2
OF WHICH IS LIKE IT IS I GUESS

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.467 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S MORE THAN A SUPER

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:17.135 region:rollup2
MAJORITY AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:18.904 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO RENDER.

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:21.072 region:rollup2
A VERDICT SO IN MY VIEW THIS IS

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:24.843 region:rollup2
JUST MY VIEW.

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:27.012 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:29.181 region:rollup2
AND THE UNANIMITY QUESTION CAN

00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:31.216 region:rollup2
BE PLAYED AROUND WITH.

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:34.019 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU MAY WANT.

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:35.086 region:rollup2
A HIGHER UNANIMITY VOTE. FOR THE

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:36.988 region:rollup2
MORE SERIOUS FOR THIS VERY

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:38.957 region:rollup2
SPECIAL.

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:39.558 region:rollup2
TYPES OF OF CASES.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.092 region:rollup2
THE LITTLE BALL DISBARMENT OR

00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:43.061 region:rollup2
OR.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:44.963 region:rollup2
EXPULSION.

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:45.564 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD SATISFY THE

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.131 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

00:32:45.564 --> 00:32:48.934 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW. I'M THINKING

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:50.902 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:52.771 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABLE TO PERSUADE.

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:55.207 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. OBTAIN AS A SUPER

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:55.807 region:rollup2
MAJORITY.

00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:57.843 region:rollup2
IS THAT BODY REALLY GONNA LOOK

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:59.244 region:rollup2
AT.

00:32:57.843 --> 00:33:00.512 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL THING IN A WAY.

00:32:59.244 --> 00:33:02.214 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:03.081 region:rollup2
VERSUS CLEAR CONVINCING THOSE

00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:05.584 region:rollup2
ARE ALL KIND OF

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:06.852 region:rollup2
FIVE OF.

00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:08.486 region:rollup2
BUT MORE FOR THIS CONCEPT OF A

00:33:06.852 --> 00:33:10.021 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE IS FIFTY PERCENT

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:11.623 region:rollup2
PLUS ONE.

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:13.592 region:rollup2
BUT CLEARLY CONVINCING INSIST

00:33:11.623 --> 00:33:15.026 region:rollup2
WHAT FIRM CONVICTION EVEN YOU

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:17.229 region:rollup2
KNOW PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:19.397 region:rollup2
DOUBT LOT OF LAWYERS KILLERS AND

00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:20.532 region:rollup2
THAT'S NINETY PERCENT. BUT THE

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:22.434 region:rollup2
LAW DOESN'T DEFINE IT THAT WAY

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:25.170 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE. YOU'RE. YOU DON'T

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:26.304 region:rollup2
HAVE A DAY A REASONABLE DOUBT

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.340 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GUILT OF THAT PERSON.

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:29.074 region:rollup2
I THINK A SUPER MAJORITY IS IS

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.276 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ENOUGH.

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:34.446 region:rollup2
OF.

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:35.580 region:rollup2
TO FIND THE ULTIMATE SANCTION.

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:37.282 region:rollup2
AND I DID SAY THAT WAS MY LAST

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.750 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:33:37.282 --> 00:33:39.885 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN TO GET A QUESTION HOW

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.319 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES YOU GET THE QUESTION

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:43.021 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE I WONDER THAT IS THAT

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.656 region:rollup2
IS AND THE BUT ALSO TO THE

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:48.627 region:rollup2
SUPREME GO TO CALIFORNIA SUPREME

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:49.227 region:rollup2
COURT SIDE? THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:50.161 region:rollup2
DO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:52.397 region:rollup2
MAY MADAM CHAIR.

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:54.299 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:56.801 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUENCY YEAH THEY HAVE

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:59.905 region:rollup2
ELECTED A REPRESENTATIVE TO

00:33:56.801 --> 00:34:02.374 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THEM. AS FLAWED AS

00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:04.576 region:rollup2
THAT REPRESENTATIVE MAY BE. AND.

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:06.144 region:rollup2
EIGHT THE WE'RE TALKING PERHAPS

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:08.480 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS WE

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:09.915 region:rollup2
AS A BODY SAYING WE DON'T WANT

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.017 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE YOU IN THE DECISION

00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:14.319 region:rollup2
MAKING. BUT THEN YOU HAVE A

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:16.454 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCY THAT NO LONGER HAS

00:34:14.319 --> 00:34:18.423 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION.

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:20.058 region:rollup2
ON WITH THE BODY. AND HOW DO YOU

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:21.326 region:rollup2
BALANCE THOSE ARE HOW DO YOU

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:23.595 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT WE BALANCE THOSE

00:34:21.326 --> 00:34:24.930 region:rollup2
THOUGH I THINK I THINK THE

00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:27.766 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE VERY FORGIVING RIGHT.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:29.901 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE ELECTORS ARE VERY.

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:32.404 region:rollup2
VERY FORGIVING. OF I DON'T KNOW

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:34.472 region:rollup2
WHAT.

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.473 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS.

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:38.176 region:rollup2
TO THAT.

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:40.111 region:rollup2
OF.

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:42.280 region:rollup2
IT'S IT IS A CONCERN. YOU KNOW

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:43.882 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN JUST YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.018 region:rollup2
THE COMES TO MIND RIGHT NOW.

00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:48.453 region:rollup2
AS I SIT HERE IS.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:51.423 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS ON THE TRIAL BENCH IF

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:52.891 region:rollup2
IF A LAWYER MESSED UP.

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:55.160 region:rollup2
I WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF THE

00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:57.095 region:rollup2
LAWYER AND NOT ON THE CLIENT.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.163 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CLIENT IS INNOCENT.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.531 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT THE LAWYER

00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:01.533 region:rollup2
MESSES UP THE SANCTION THE

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:03.068 region:rollup2
LAWYER BUT NOT THE CLIENT LISTS

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:05.103 region:rollup2
THAN SOME OTHER CLIENT IS DONE.

00:35:03.068 --> 00:35:06.705 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN YOU KNOW ALSO IN

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:08.540 region:rollup2
CAHOOTS WITH THE LORD OF. THE

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:10.976 region:rollup2
DELAY WHATEVER.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.211 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ALWAYS MY MY VIEW YOU

00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:15.613 region:rollup2
KNOW. PUNISH THE ONE WHO DID THE

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:19.084 region:rollup2
WRONGDOING. BUT DON'T PUNISH THE

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:20.552 region:rollup2
CLIENT AND MAYBE IN THE SENSE.

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:23.188 region:rollup2
THE ELECTORATE ARE THE CLIENTS

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:25.156 region:rollup2
OF THE. OF THE LEGISLATOR I MEAN

00:35:23.188 --> 00:35:26.091 region:rollup2
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YES

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:27.659 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WHAT I WOULD IT WOULD

00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:29.327 region:rollup2
BE A BIG CONCERN TO ME YOU WANT

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:30.495 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.597 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISM IS.

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:34.265 region:rollup2
FOR THE.

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:36.101 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT PRO TEM OR THE OR THE

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:39.471 region:rollup2
SPEAKER.

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:41.373 region:rollup2
TO. ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:43.308 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE REPRESENT AND

00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:44.776 region:rollup2
HAVE A VOICE.

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:46.344 region:rollup2
OF CERTAIN THAT'S A TOUGH

00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:48.079 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:49.848 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:52.017 region:rollup2
BALANCE IT WITH.

00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:53.618 region:rollup2
MAKING THE VICTIM HOLE YES

00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:55.086 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE VICTIM IS THE ONE

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.553 region:rollup2
WHO HAS BEEN INJURED THROUGH

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:57.655 region:rollup2
VERY DIRECTLY YES THE

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:59.457 region:rollup2
ELECTORATE.

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:00.825 region:rollup2
VERY DIRECTLY THE VICTIM HAS

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:02.894 region:rollup2
BEEN INJURED AND FINDING A WAY

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:05.163 region:rollup2
FOR THAT VICTIM TO ALSO HAVE

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.864 region:rollup2
JUSTICE RIGHT. AND I THINK THE

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.765 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:09.367 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:10.635 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE LATER ON AND

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:12.270 region:rollup2
THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE MODEL.

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:14.205 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHERE

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.708 region:rollup2
YOU DO CONSIDER THE HARM THAT

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:17.509 region:rollup2
WAS DONE. ASIDE PUTTING ASIDE

00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:19.210 region:rollup2
WHATEVER PUNITIVE ACTIONS ARE

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:20.812 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE. THE HARM THAT WAS

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.881 region:rollup2
DONE HELPING TO FIX THE

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:23.982 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND HOW COULD YOU MOVE

00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:25.750 region:rollup2
ON.

00:36:23.982 --> 00:36:28.186 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE BULK OF CASES NOT

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:30.021 region:rollup2
TO. DIMINISH THE SERVICES OF

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.189 region:rollup2
THESE CASES FILED IN THE BOX BOX

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.190 region:rollup2
OF CASES.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.925 region:rollup2
BUT TALK ABOUT THE AGGRAVATED

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.993 region:rollup2
ASSAULTS.

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:36.761 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PARTIES ARE WILLING TO

00:36:34.993 --> 00:36:38.496 region:rollup2
ENTER THAT FRAMEWORK?

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:39.597 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE THE BOAST THE BEST

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:41.099 region:rollup2
AND MOST JUST WAY OF RESOLVING

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:43.334 region:rollup2
THESE CASES.

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:44.803 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:47.205 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I

00:36:44.803 --> 00:36:49.274 region:rollup2
WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON KIND OF.

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.674 region:rollup2
MYSTERY AS.

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:51.676 region:rollup2
LINE OF THINKING.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:54.245 region:rollup2
.

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:54.979 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN OFFICE IS

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:57.816 region:rollup2
VACANT IS?

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:59.584 region:rollup2
STAFF CONTINUES AND SO A

00:36:57.816 --> 00:37:01.853 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT CAN CONTINUE TO CALL

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:03.221 region:rollup2
A DISTRICT OFFICE AND AND HAVE

00:37:01.853 --> 00:37:05.023 region:rollup2
YOUR CONSTITUENT SERVICES THE

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.958 region:rollup2
LCMS IS OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE THE

00:37:05.023 --> 00:37:07.759 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OFFICES ARE STILL OPEN

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:10.628 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:13.031 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE CONSTITUENTS DON'T

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:14.666 region:rollup2
HAVE A VOTE. ON A BILL ON THE

00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:17.736 region:rollup2
FLOOR ON THE BUDGET AND SO IT

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:19.871 region:rollup2
REALLY IS. A CONUNDRUM ON IN

00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:22.640 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW AND WE'RE IN A

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:23.208 region:rollup2
SITUATION NOW WHERE THERE ARE

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.342 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BUILT

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:26.077 region:rollup2
THEIR SIMPLY MEMBER AND THEIR

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:27.412 region:rollup2
SENATOR.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:29.180 region:rollup2
.

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:32.784 region:rollup2
ON LEAVES ARE HAVING TAKING SO

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:34.419 region:rollup2
THERE IS. NOW NO REPRESENTATION

00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:35.520 region:rollup2
ON TERMS OF ACTUAL VOTES THE

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:36.621 region:rollup2
LAST PIECE I WAS GOING TO ADD

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.323 region:rollup2
THIS IN TERMS OF FIGURE OUT THIS

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:40.058 region:rollup2
BALANCE AND HOW WE DON'T PUNISH

00:37:38.323 --> 00:37:41.726 region:rollup2
THE CONTENT CONSTITUENCY. IS

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:45.597 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS SUCH AN

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:46.464 region:rollup2
INSULAR WORKPLACE. THAT IF YOU

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.031 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE STATE

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:49.400 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:51.369 region:rollup2
AND AND HOW WE CREATE THAT

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.671 region:rollup2
SENSE OF BALANCE AND PROTECTION

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:55.206 region:rollup2
FOR THE EMPLOYEES. IF IT INDEED

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:57.709 region:rollup2
IS AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS THE

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:59.511 region:rollup2
VICTIM THIS WHOLE WORLD IN WHICH

00:37:57.709 --> 00:38:01.679 region:rollup2
WE WORK IS VERY INSULAR FOR BOTH

00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:04.682 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEES MEMBERS OF THE

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:06.651 region:rollup2
THIRD HOUSE. WHO'VE BEEN ENGAGED

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:07.318 region:rollup2
IN THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL AND

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.952 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE THIRD CONSTITUENCY

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:09.254 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:14.058 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE HEAR AND

00:38:09.254 --> 00:38:14.959 region:rollup2
PROTECT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY.

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:16.928 region:rollup2
ARE REPRESENTED.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:19.063 region:rollup2
ALSO THROUGH DUE PROCESS AS WE

00:38:16.928 --> 00:38:22.033 region:rollup2
BUILD THIS OLD SYSTEM FIVE ONE

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:24.135 region:rollup2
TO ADD THAT PEACE BUT IT'S. IT'S

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.937 region:rollup2
SO VERY GRAY.

ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE

CONTACT. CONDUCT THAT WOULD

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:04.542 region:rollup2
CAUSE IMMEDIATE FIRING MY MY

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:06.511 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IS IT WHEN WE'RE

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:10.014 region:rollup2

HAVE IN OUR CONTRACTS WAS? THESE

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:18.256 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THINGS BEHAVIORS

00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:19.991 region:rollup2
COULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:22.060 region:rollup2
TERMINATION AND WE ALWAYS YOU

00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.962 region:rollup2
KNOW IT INCLUDING BUT NOT

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.564 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO DO YOU THINK IT'S

00:39:23.962 --> 00:39:27.699 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO OUTLINE.

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:30.635 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT COULD CAUSE

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:32.003 region:rollup2
TERMINATION OR EXPULSION.

00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:34.372 region:rollup2

00:39:32.003 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2
OKAY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:36.307 region:rollup2
THE THIS IS ME.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.243 region:rollup2
AGAINST MANDATORY MINIMUM

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:40.411 region:rollup2
SENTENCES.

00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:41.679 region:rollup2
OF PARTICULAR THE SPECTER DRUG

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:43.848 region:rollup2
CASES IN OTHER KINDS OF THINGS

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:46.084 region:rollup2
THAT. IT REALLY TIES THE HANDS

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:48.253 region:rollup2
OF THE JUDGE SO. I DON'T THINK A

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:49.654 region:rollup2
RULE THAT WOULD TIE THE HAND

00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:51.022 region:rollup2
THAT SALUTE LEAGUE.

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:52.824 region:rollup2
OF THE JUDICATA BODY WOULD BE A

00:39:51.022 --> 00:39:54.926 region:rollup2
GOOD ONE YOU GOT A.

00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:56.127 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE'RE ALL OF. THIS IS

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:58.162 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SYSTEM OF.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:59.564 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW DEALING WITH

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:01.666 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER AND. THINGS GOING

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:03.935 region:rollup2
AWRY.

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK THAT THE.

00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:07.038 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.840 region:rollup2
NOTICED THAT SOMETHING IS REALLY

00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:09.874 region:rollup2
BAD IS BASED ON PRECEDENT WHAT

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.310 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AND.

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:15.146 region:rollup2
IN PRIOR CASES AND SO FORTH.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:17.315 region:rollup2
BUT A MANDATORY OF JUST LETTING

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:17.882 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THAT IF THEY

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.483 region:rollup2
DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:21.219 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:23.388 region:rollup2
REMOVED BUT REQUIRING IT.

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:25.023 region:rollup2
MANDATORILY.

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:26.157 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK SO FAIR ENOUGH

00:40:25.023 --> 00:40:27.792 region:rollup2
HOWEVER YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:29.761 region:rollup2
AT WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:31.462 region:rollup2
IN IT NOT HANG AND GET NOT ANY

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:33.331 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE. IT'S A LITTLE

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:35.800 region:rollup2
SHOCKING SOMETIMES AND I JUST

00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:37.769 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE I I HEARD WHAT

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.104 region:rollup2
YOU SAID EARLIER. THAT WHEN WE

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:41.706 region:rollup2
ARE. MAKING SURE THAT SOMEONE

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.874 region:rollup2
ELSE HAD DUE PROCESS WE WANT TO

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:44.208 region:rollup2
LOOK AT A PREPONDERANCE OF

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:45.777 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE.

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.378 region:rollup2
THREE QUARTERS OF THE BODY

00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:49.280 region:rollup2
AGREEING ON DISCIPLINE WHAT'S

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:51.716 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS FAIR AND WAS A

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.483 region:rollup2
DECISION BASED ON FACTS. THOSE

00:40:51.716 --> 00:40:53.685 region:rollup2
ARE THE THINGS SHE THE

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.920 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS YOU THINK WE SHOULD

00:40:53.685 --> 00:40:57.655 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. EXCEPT FOR THE THREE

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.257 region:rollup2
QUARTERS I THINK OKAY. YOU KNOW

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:00.992 region:rollup2
THE SUPER MAJORITY DEPENDS ON

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:02.660 region:rollup2
THE BODY HE MIGHT WANT. TO A

00:41:00.992 --> 00:41:04.929 region:rollup2
MAJORITY THINK IS WHAT SIXTY SIX

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.230 region:rollup2
PERCENT TWO OUT OF THREE. OR

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:07.565 region:rollup2
THREE OUT OF FIVE WHATEVER.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.267 region:rollup2
HOWEVER YOU DEFINE WHAT SUPER

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:11.336 region:rollup2
MAJORITY IS A. THREE QUARTERS

00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:13.738 region:rollup2
COMES FROM OUR CIVIL JUSTICE

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:16.174 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN CIVIL CASES. THE SUPER

00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:18.176 region:rollup2
MAJORITY RATHER THAN THREE

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:18.943 region:rollup2
QUARTERS RIGHT CATCH. THANK YOU

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.745 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:22.847 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I'M IT'S WONDERFUL TO

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.183 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL AND I REALLY

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:26.284 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE IT I HAVE A QUESTION

00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:27.719 region:rollup2
FOR YOU THAT'S A VERY UNFAIR

00:41:26.284 --> 00:41:29.854 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.655 region:rollup2
BIGGEST. ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:34.459 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WITH REGARD TO

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:36.794 region:rollup2
THIS. WHICH HAS TO DO WITH ARM.

00:41:34.459 --> 00:41:38.329 region:rollup2
OUR NATURE AS A BODY BEING IN

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE EIGHTY MEMBERS

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.932 region:rollup2
AND IN SORRY IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:42.500 region:rollup2
EIGHTY MEMBERS AND FORTY IN THE

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:43.501 region:rollup2
SENATE.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.836 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR ROLE

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.571 region:rollup2
AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:49.240 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY HAVING TO. DEAL

00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:51.409 region:rollup2
WITH DISCIPLINING OF LAWYERS OR

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.243 region:rollup2
JUDGES UNDERNEATH YOU IT'S VERY

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:52.977 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN ONE IF YOU WERE

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.979 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH.

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:56.414 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE WITH ONE OF YOUR OWN

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:58.883 region:rollup2
SITTING COLLEAGUES ON THE

00:41:56.414 --> 00:42:00.718 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT AND YET THAT'S

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:01.886 region:rollup2
WHAT A LOT OF OUR PROCESS WHEN

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.354 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO CERTAINLY THE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:06.524 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LEVEL OF DEALING WITH

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:07.859 region:rollup2
MEMBERS. ARE COMES DOWN TO AND I

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.360 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WEIRD WERE

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:11.229 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BODY THAN A PRIVATE

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.764 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION BUT ADVICE IF WE

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:14.132 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY

00:42:12.764 --> 00:42:14.966 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH A SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:16.567 region:rollup2
CLAIM BY PUTTING ALL THE

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:17.635 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN ONE ROOM. AND

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:19.070 region:rollup2
HAVING THEM VOTE ON WHAT HAPPENS

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:20.004 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES WE

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.506 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT THAT WAS

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:22.240 region:rollup2
LUDICROUS BUT THAT'S THE

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:25.810 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.911 region:rollup2
DOING. IN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.845 region:rollup2
AND.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:29.614 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE OF

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:31.449 region:rollup2
THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:33.117 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WORK THERE'S ALWAYS A

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:35.420 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION OF BIAS WHEN IT COMES

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:37.055 region:rollup2
TO US. BOATING ON WHAT HAPPENS

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.856 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF OUR MEMBERS.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:40.958 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE VERY TIED TOGETHER IN

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:42.560 region:rollup2
TERMS OF NEEDING EACH OTHER FOR

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.362 region:rollup2
VOTES AND THAT SORT OF THING.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.030 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THE IDEAS THAT

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:48.800 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ON OUR

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:51.302 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR. AN

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.804 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE GROUP OF SOME SORT TO AT

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:54.205 region:rollup2
LEAST MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO

00:42:52.804 --> 00:42:56.641 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:42:54.205 --> 00:42:59.243 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT PERCEPTION OF BIAS

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:01.479 region:rollup2
MAYBE CAN BE DIFFUSED OR.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:02.914 region:rollup2
.

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:04.949 region:rollup2
NOT THAT WE WOULD SHIRK OUR

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:06.984 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO. IMPOSE OUR

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:09.620 region:rollup2
OWN DISCIPLINE BUT THAT HAVING

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:10.221 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF AN OUTSIDE.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.690 region:rollup2
BODY OR PERSON OR WHATEVER IT

00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.925 region:rollup2
IS.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.426 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND I'M JUST

00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:19.530 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS. AS TO THAT.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:20.965 region:rollup2
AND I GO BACK AND FORTH YOU

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.600 region:rollup2
KNOW SOMETIMES I THINK WE NEED

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:24.368 region:rollup2
TO SHOW THAT WE CAN KIND OF

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.803 region:rollup2
POLICE OURSELVES. AND THAT'S MY

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:27.572 region:rollup2
WAS I THINK THAT THAT'S ALWAYS

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:29.240 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SEEN AS THOUGH THERE

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:30.875 region:rollup2
WAS ANY ACCUSATIONS OF OF SOME

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.143 region:rollup2
KIND OF BUYERS ARE IN COURT.

00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:33.444 region:rollup2
IMPROPRIETY I JUST WONDER IF YOU

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:34.679 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IF YOU WANT

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.113 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND COME

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:39.083 region:rollup2
BACK AND TALK ABOUT IT OR

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:39.550 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YEAH. BEFORE I FORGET

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:41.119 region:rollup2
YES PLEASE.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.953 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE INTERESTING CONCEPT

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.654 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.590 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT WHEN YOU ARE JUDGING

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:47.024 region:rollup2
YOUR PEERS.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.660 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE'S THERE COULD BE A

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:51.462 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ABUSES OF POLITICAL.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.131 region:rollup2
FAVORS AND WANTING TO GET RID OF

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:56.567 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY FOR OTHER REASONS

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:59.770 region:rollup2
UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:44:01.973 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IF I I DON'T KNOW IF THE

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:03.941 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:05.743 region:rollup2
IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED AN OUTSIDE

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:08.546 region:rollup2
BODY OR CERTAINLY THE.

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:10.181 region:rollup2
IN THE. FOUR JUDGES THERE IS AN

00:44:08.546 --> 00:44:11.282 region:rollup2

EXPECTATIONS ARE. ONE OF THE

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.846 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE REALIZED AS.

00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:03.247 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:04.448 region:rollup2
CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION THIS IS

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:05.750 region:rollup2
NOT THE SITUATION THAT THE

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:07.618 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FINDS ITSELF AND YOU

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.587 region:rollup2

EMPLOYERS EVEN SURPRISINGLY

00:48:11.322 --> 00:48:14.592 region:rollup2
LARGE EMPLOYERS FOLKS JUST DON'T

00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:16.293 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I'M SO WE PUT

00:48:14.592 --> 00:48:18.696 region:rollup2
TOGETHER A PANEL OF EXPERTS

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:20.164 region:rollup2
INCLUDING AMY OPPENHEIMER AND WE

00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:21.432 region:rollup2
CAME UP WITH THIS WORKPLACE

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:22.833 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION GUIDE IT'S PART OF

00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:23.367 region:rollup2
THE MATERIALS THAT ARE ON THE

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.902 region:rollup2
WEBSITE FOR THIS.

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:27.238 region:rollup2
HEARING.

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:29.106 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:30.374 region:rollup2
EVAN. AND THE FIRST THING THAT I

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:32.143 region:rollup2
JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS THAT

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.778 region:rollup2
EVEN IF SOMEONE CHOOSES TO FILE

00:48:32.143 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
A COMPLAINT WITH THE DIFF DFU

00:48:33.778 --> 00:48:37.982 region:rollup2
AGE OR WITH THE EOC. THAT DOES

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.783 region:rollup2
NOT RELIEVE ANY EMPLOYER OF

00:48:37.982 --> 00:48:40.451 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING THEIR OWN

00:48:38.783 --> 00:48:41.385 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO TRY TO GET TO

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:44.421 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM OF THE ALLEGATIONS

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:45.356 region:rollup2
AND MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT.

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:48.459 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:48:45.356 --> 00:48:50.661 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE OUR SLIDE SLIGHTLY

00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:51.996 region:rollup2
OUT OF ORDER BIZARRE NAMES THIS

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:53.731 region:rollup2
IS OUR.

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:54.865 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR COMPLAINT FLOW CHART

00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:57.234 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS AT THE

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:58.702 region:rollup2
DF DH AND I JUST INCLUDED THIS

00:48:57.234 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
AS A REFERENCE FOR THE PUBLIC.

I'M IT'S ALSO UP ON OUR WEBSITE

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.274 region:rollup2
AND IT SHOWS YOU ALTHOUGH THE

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND

00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.942 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT I WANT TO

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:06.410 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:07.344 region:rollup2
DOES FILE WITH US OR WITH THE

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.513 region:rollup2
EOC.

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:11.081 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RESULT

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:13.918 region:rollup2
IN AN INVESTIGATION PEOPLE HAVE

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.385 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THE SO

00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:16.153 region:rollup2
CALLED RIGHT TO SUE.

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:17.755 region:rollup2
WHICH INVOLVES ABSOLUTELY NO AND

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.256 region:rollup2
NOT LYSIS OR DETERMINATION ON

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:21.792 region:rollup2
OUR PART THAT IS AN AUTOMATIC

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:23.194 region:rollup2
FUNCTION. THEY SAY I DON'T WANT

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.829 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS TO INVESTIGATE I WANT

00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:26.497 region:rollup2
MY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND I'M

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:28.766 region:rollup2
GONNA GET IT. I MEAN THEY CAN

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:29.567 region:rollup2
GET THAT AUTOMATICALLY. VIA THE

00:49:28.766 --> 00:49:32.002 region:rollup2
WEBSITE.

OKAY.

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:36.841 region:rollup2

ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS AND IN

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.794 region:rollup2
FACT DURING THE TIME THAT WE

00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:57.928 region:rollup2
HAVE SAT HERE. THERE ARE

00:49:56.794 --> 00:49:59.263 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE

00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:00.397 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:02.399 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINED AND FIRED WITH NO

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:04.435 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION AT ALL. ABOUT WHY

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:07.071 region:rollup2
THAT IS SO AND I JUST WANT TO.

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:08.138 region:rollup2
RAISE THE CAUTION THAT WE NOT

00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:09.707 region:rollup2
CREATE AN EXPECTATION THAT

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:11.508 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL

00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:13.844 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ARE SOMEHOW ENTITLED.

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:15.246 region:rollup2
TO MORE PROTECTIONS THAN ANY

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:17.915 region:rollup2
OTHER EMPLOYEE THAT IS NOT THE

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:19.283 region:rollup2
CASE WITH THAT SIDE. I DO THINK

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:20.951 region:rollup2
THAT DUE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT

00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:22.553 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR FAIRNESS AND FOR THE

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.587 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION OF FAIRNESS I'M IN

00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:27.191 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE WAYS THAT JUSTICE

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:28.859 region:rollup2
MARINO HAS. DESCRIBED BUT I'M I

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.293 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO CAUTION THE

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:31.595 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT.

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:34.231 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:35.666 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION.

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.800 region:rollup2
.

00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:38.269 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS IS WHAT THE EMPLOYER

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.071 region:rollup2
CREATES THERE'S NO INDEPENDENT

00:50:38.269 --> 00:50:44.808 region:rollup2
LEGAL CONTENTS TO THAT TO THAT

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:46.610 region:rollup2
PHRASE. I'M IN OUR.

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:48.112 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE THE H. GUIDELINES

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.314 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE THE MOST RECENT.

00:50:48.112 --> 00:50:51.448 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE DOCUMENT OF THE SORT

00:50:50.314 --> 00:50:53.183 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW OF.

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:53.751 region:rollup2
.

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:56.720 region:rollup2
WE SAY THAT DUE PROCESS DOES

00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:59.089 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.725 region:rollup2
INVOLVE TELLING A PERSON ACCUSED

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:03.494 region:rollup2
OF MISCONDUCT OR HARASSMENT.

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:05.496 region:rollup2
IN ADVANCE WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.063 region:rollup2
ARE AN IMPACT OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:51:05.496 --> 00:51:07.331 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT NOT HAPPEN THAT

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:10.000 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:11.468 region:rollup2
PROVIDED DETAILED AND COMPLETE.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.137 region:rollup2
LIST OF THE ALLEGATIONS WHEN YOU

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:14.805 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW WITH THE PERSON WHO'S

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:16.540 region:rollup2
BEEN ACCUSED BUT THAT YOU NOT

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:17.608 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT IN ADVANCE ABOUT

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.577 region:rollup2
DIFFERS IN SOME WAYS.

00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:20.644 region:rollup2
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:21.979 region:rollup2
CERTAIN OTHER AREAS OF LAW

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:24.214 region:rollup2
INCLUDING TITLE NINE WHICH I

00:51:21.979 --> 00:51:25.382 region:rollup2
WHERE I THINK IT'S. ON CAMPUSES

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.850 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE COMMON TO PRESENT A

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.184 region:rollup2
KIND OF A LIST OF THE

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:31.221 region:rollup2
ACCUSATIONS.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:33.057 region:rollup2
.

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.958 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:35.025 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT IS IT ONE OF THE

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.861 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE FREQUENTLY GET AS

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.363 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WANT US TO INTERVIEW

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:41.966 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE.

00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:43.367 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS DOES NOT REQUIRE

00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:45.102 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:46.904 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:47.404 region:rollup2
AND ALL KNOWLEDGE OR WHO ARE NOT

00:51:46.904 --> 00:51:49.006 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO HAVE PERSONAL

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:50.908 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF THE OF THE EVENTS

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:52.042 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE

00:51:50.908 --> 00:51:54.445 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:56.180 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS THAT WE EXPECT FOLKS

00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:56.747 region:rollup2
TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.983 region:rollup2
OF COURSE.

00:51:56.747 --> 00:52:00.684 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ELEMENT OF DUE

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:02.119 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT THERE'S A. THERE'S

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.287 region:rollup2
THE PROCEDURE OF WOMEN OF IS

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.755 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS FAIR THERE'S A

00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:06.357 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENT OF WHAT

00:52:04.755 --> 00:52:07.958 region:rollup2
EXACTLY ARE YOU ALLOWING. THE

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:09.360 region:rollup2
PARTIES TO DO AND THEN

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:11.128 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY IT ALSO REQUIRES

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.696 region:rollup2
FOLKS TO COME TO A REASONABLE

00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:14.431 region:rollup2
AND FAIR CONCLUSION. I'M AND

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:16.066 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA AGAIN I DON'T THINK

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:17.501 region:rollup2
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THIS BODY. IN

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:19.103 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BUT IN A VERY

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.604 region:rollup2
SURPRISING NUMBER OF CASES THAT

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:22.406 region:rollup2
WE SEE. ARE THE INVESTIGATION

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:23.707 region:rollup2
LEADS ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE THERE'S

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:24.441 region:rollup2
NO CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR THE

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:26.210 region:rollup2
OTHER AT THE END OF THE

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:27.011 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND I JUST WANT TO

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.712 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT FOR FOLKS WATCHING

00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:31.415 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS NOT. AN EFFECTIVE

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:33.150 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND NOT WHAT WE

00:52:31.415 --> 00:52:34.885 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.487 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:38.756 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO CONFIDENTIALITY

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:40.524 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW I THINK JUSTICE MIGHT

00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:42.092 region:rollup2
NOT TOUCHED ON THIS AS WELL.

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.693 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING YOU TELL

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.927 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS

00:52:42.693 --> 00:52:45.129 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:46.797 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHO HAS A LOT OF THEM

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:48.999 region:rollup2
I'M AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:50.000 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.602 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT TO FOLKS IS THAT.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.970 region:rollup2
.

00:52:51.602 --> 00:52:54.638 region:rollup2
WE WE THROW THE WORD

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:56.640 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:58.409 region:rollup2
AROUND AT THE END OF THE DAY BY

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.710 region:rollup2
AND LARGE AND MOST WORKPLACES

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:01.612 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.880 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. AND IT'S JUST

00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:04.048 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.315 region:rollup2
I'M SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE

00:53:04.048 --> 00:53:08.118 region:rollup2
UNREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS ON THE

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:08.719 region:rollup2
PART OF PEOPLE WHO COME FORWARD

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:09.687 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO PROTECT

00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:12.489 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:14.191 region:rollup2
I'M. SO. WITH THANKS TO AMY FOR

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:16.393 region:rollup2
HELPING ME BRAINSTORM ON THIS

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.628 region:rollup2
ISSUE I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE.

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:19.563 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE

00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:21.865 region:rollup2
SHOULD FOCUS ON EVEN MORE THAN

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:23.200 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY ONE IS HOW DO

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.735 region:rollup2
YOU MANAGE THE FALLOUT WHEN

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.904 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING

00:53:24.735 --> 00:53:29.206 region:rollup2
ON AS THEY DO. I'M IN ALMOST

00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:30.808 region:rollup2
EVERY INVESTIGATION SO WHAT KIND

00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:32.376 region:rollup2
OF MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING TO

00:53:30.808 --> 00:53:34.011 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:36.213 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:39.183 region:rollup2
WRONGDOING THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:43.020 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT UP. ACCUSATION. THEM

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:45.022 region:rollup2
INTO AND CRUCIALLY HOW DO YOU.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.557 region:rollup2
PROTECT AND CONVEY YOUR

00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:48.992 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING

00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:50.994 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AND PARTIES.

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:53.931 region:rollup2
FROM RETALIATION AND.

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:56.333 region:rollup2
SADLY I THINK THAT RETALIATION

00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:58.135 region:rollup2
IS VERY REAL WE FREQUENTLY SEE

00:53:56.333 --> 00:53:59.403 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE THE UNDERLYING

00:53:58.135 --> 00:54:01.205 region:rollup2
CONDUCT MAY NOT IN FACT BE

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:02.206 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED BUT THE PERSON WHO

00:54:01.205 --> 00:54:03.740 region:rollup2
COMPLAINED DID IN FACT

00:54:02.206 --> 00:54:05.476 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE RETALIATION FOR

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.343 region:rollup2
BRINGING IT FORWARD AND THAT IS

00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:08.579 region:rollup2
A COMMON OCCURRENCE.

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:09.646 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD SAY IN BOTH PUBLIC

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:12.950 region:rollup2
AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS.

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:14.952 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ENTIRELY HUMAN.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:16.420 region:rollup2
TO NOT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HAS

00:54:14.952 --> 00:54:17.154 region:rollup2
ACCUSED HER DOING SOMETHING

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.756 region:rollup2
WRONG.

00:54:17.154 --> 00:54:19.923 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT AS

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:21.458 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SOME

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:23.260 region:rollup2
PLAYERS WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:27.464 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO ANTI

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:29.199 region:rollup2
RETALIATION PRINCIPLES.

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:31.201 region:rollup2
I'M TIMELINESS IS IMPORTANT IN

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:33.871 region:rollup2
HERE AND YOU KNOW THIS IS AGAIN

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:36.306 region:rollup2
FOR. MANY EMPLOYERS WATCHING IF

00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:38.809 region:rollup2
YOU FARM THE INVESTIGATION OUT

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:40.310 region:rollup2
JUST BE ALERTS TO DELAY. IN

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:41.979 region:rollup2
GENERAL IF THE ALLEGATION IS

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.614 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS EVENT INVOLVES

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:45.149 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:49.219 region:rollup2
UNWANTED TOUCHING YOU NEED TO

00:54:45.149 --> 00:54:51.488 region:rollup2
TAKE HAS.

COME FORWARD IS PROTECTED.

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:56.593 region:rollup2
GENERALLY WITHIN A FEW DAYS.

00:54:54.892 --> 00:54:57.895 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO. WERE WITHIN A DAY

AND EXPLAINING THAT YOU WILL BE

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.370 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION

00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:08.839 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME FACT WHAT YOU'RE

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.641 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO. I'M AND WE TRY AND

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:11.842 region:rollup2
GET IT DONE WE AT THE DF YES I

00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:13.277 region:rollup2
WOULD LOVE TO GET IT DONE IN A

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:15.646 region:rollup2
FEW WEEKS AND BY AND LARGE THAT

00:55:13.277 --> 00:55:17.181 region:rollup2
IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US. BUT FOR

00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:18.816 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS CONDUCTING INTERNAL

00:55:17.181 --> 00:55:20.884 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN IT IS NOW

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:22.986 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON THINGS

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:26.323 region:rollup2
LIKE IF SOMEBODY OUT ON LEAVE.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:26.690 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ON VACATION OBVIOUSLY

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:27.357 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.225 region:rollup2
.

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.460 region:rollup2
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED THEIR.

00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:33.197 region:rollup2
IMPARTIALITY OBVIOUSLY EVERY

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.531 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION MUST BE. IMPARTIAL

00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:36.567 region:rollup2
I'M AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT THERE

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:38.569 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE A PERCEPTION OF

00:55:36.567 --> 00:55:40.037 region:rollup2
PARTIALITY SO THE PERCEPTION OF

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:42.673 region:rollup2
BIAS I NEVER SOMETHING THAT THIS

00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:45.275 region:rollup2
BODY IS. IS GRAPPLING WITH.

00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:46.510 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:48.512 region:rollup2
TO EITHER DO SOMETHING

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.347 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY OR FARM IT OUT TO AN

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:53.083 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL BODY.

00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:55.052 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL THE HIGHER RANKING

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.053 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF

00:55:55.052 --> 00:55:58.722 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINT.

00:55:56.053 --> 00:55:59.890 region:rollup2
THE MORE CHANCE THAT THERE WILL

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:01.825 region:rollup2
BE A PERCEPTION THAT THE

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:03.260 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION ITSELF IS BIASED IN

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:05.429 region:rollup2
FAVOR OF THAT PERSON. I'M SO

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.030 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FACTOR TO CONSIDER AND

00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:08.999 region:rollup2
DECIDING WHETHER TO GIVE AN

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:12.135 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO AN OUTSIDE BODY

00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:14.438 region:rollup2
OR TAKE CONDUCTED INTERNALLY.

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:15.973 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME THE FACTORS IN THE

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:17.741 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS

00:56:15.973 --> 00:56:20.410 region:rollup2
AND TRAINING.

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:22.546 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. SUGGESTIONS ABOUT

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.681 region:rollup2
TYPES OF QUESTIONING AND

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:27.050 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION.

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:28.452 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE GET TO CREDIBILITY

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.487 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS AND THIS IS VERY.

00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:31.088 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL BECAUSE ONE OF THE

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:32.155 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE MOST FREQUENTLY

00:56:31.088 --> 00:56:34.091 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:35.225 region:rollup2
AND IS THAT PEOPLE FIND IT VERY

00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:37.494 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO MAKE CREDIBILITY

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:39.763 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS THE ABSENCE OF

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:40.297 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OTHER THAN.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.899 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON SAYS SOMETHING

00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:43.867 region:rollup2
HAPPENED. THE OTHER PERSON SAYS

00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:45.002 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T. AND OT SET IN SO WE

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:46.670 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY SEE EVEN VERY

00:56:45.002 --> 00:56:49.106 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.973 region:rollup2
WRITING THINGS LIKE THE ISSUE

00:56:49.106 --> 00:56:51.375 region:rollup2
REMAINS IN DISPUTE.

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:52.175 region:rollup2
NO IT DOESN'T YOU'VE JUST

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:54.077 region:rollup2
DECIDED THE ISSUE.

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:55.545 region:rollup2
ANY DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:57.080 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:59.216 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.817 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON THE EVIDENCE IS NOT

00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:02.319 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH IT. I'M

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:03.954 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:05.422 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON A LOT WITH OUR OWN

00:57:03.954 --> 00:57:08.959 region:rollup2
STUFF THE DFU CHIN AND

00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:09.993 region:rollup2
EMPOWERING TO MAKE THAT CALL

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:12.129 region:rollup2
IT'S A TOUGH CALL TO MAKE.

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:13.664 region:rollup2
WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT

00:57:12.129 --> 00:57:15.265 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE LYING TO US. I'M AND

00:57:13.664 --> 00:57:15.799 region:rollup2
I THINK ON A HUMAN LEVEL THIS IS

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:17.034 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.502 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF AN INVESTIGATION

00:57:17.034 --> 00:57:20.270 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES

00:57:18.502 --> 00:57:22.172 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW WHICH IS

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.640 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE AND A

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:25.409 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.478 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT INVESTIGATION.

00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:29.546 region:rollup2
HERE AND ELSEWHERE.

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:31.748 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT CREDIBILITY

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:33.617 region:rollup2
FACTORS IN OUR GUIDANCE AND WE

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:35.152 region:rollup2
ALSO CAUTION ABOUT THE USE OF

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:36.820 region:rollup2
DEMEANOR BECAUSE ONE OF THE

00:57:35.152 --> 00:57:38.689 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT SOCIAL SCIENCE TELLS

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.924 region:rollup2
US IS THAT THERE IS NO ONE

00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:43.694 region:rollup2
DEMEANOR. THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:45.462 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED HARASSMENT UP TO AND

00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:46.797 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ASSAULT HAS I'M THAT

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:48.165 region:rollup2
PERSON MIGHT NOT MAKE EYE

00:57:46.797 --> 00:57:50.067 region:rollup2
CONTACT THAT PERSON MIGHT BE

00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:52.336 region:rollup2
VERY DIRECT THAT PERSON MIGHT BE

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:54.371 region:rollup2
ANGRY. I'M THAT PERSON MIGHT BE

00:57:52.336 --> 00:57:56.907 region:rollup2
VERY RETIRING. THERE IS NO

00:57:54.371 --> 00:58:00.844 region:rollup2
COMMON THEME TO HELP PEOPLE.

00:57:56.907 --> 00:58:02.546 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:04.081 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF PROOF WE HEARD A LOT

00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:05.949 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS FROM JUSTICE MARINO

00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:07.918 region:rollup2
IN A WORKPLACE. HARASSMENT

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:09.219 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AT THE DF PH WE

00:58:07.918 --> 00:58:10.821 region:rollup2
BELIEVE FINDING SHOULD BE BASED

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:12.389 region:rollup2
ON A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:15.625 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:16.626 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:18.628 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.895 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE CIVIL LEGAL

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:21.965 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:23.467 region:rollup2
.

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:25.268 region:rollup2
NOW WHETHER A PARTICULAR

00:58:23.467 --> 00:58:26.803 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:27.637 region:rollup2
TAKES ACTION AND WHAT ACTION

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.039 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE IS A DIFFERENT

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:30.407 region:rollup2
QUESTION. BUT IN TERMS OF

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:31.708 region:rollup2
REACHING A CONCLUSION

00:58:30.407 --> 00:58:33.210 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IS

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:35.512 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD FOR WORKPLACE

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:38.482 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS WHICH ARE

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:40.417 region:rollup2
CIVIL LAW ALLEGATIONS.

00:58:38.482 --> 00:58:41.618 region:rollup2
I'M IS THIS IS INTERESTING AND

00:58:40.417 --> 00:58:43.286 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FOR YOU GUYS TO DEBATE

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.855 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY BUT.

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:46.323 region:rollup2
THERE IS A DIFFERENT PRACTICES

00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:47.958 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:49.259 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IS SUPPORT KIND OF

00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:51.328 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IT'S SUPPOSED TO

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:52.596 region:rollup2
RESULT IN AND VERY FREQUENTLY

00:58:51.328 --> 00:58:54.698 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS DO NOT WANT LEGAL

00:58:52.596 --> 00:58:56.466 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED LEGAL CONCLUSIONS OR

00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:58.635 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE FORM OF.

00:58:56.466 --> 00:59:00.871 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TOOK PLACE.

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:02.139 region:rollup2
INSTEAD THEY WANT FACTUAL

00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:04.007 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS WHICH SOMETIMES

00:59:02.139 --> 00:59:05.242 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO THE SAME THING IT'S I

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:06.743 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT FRED BY A

00:59:05.242 --> 00:59:08.912 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:11.748 region:rollup2
SAID X. Y. Z. TO SALLY.

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:13.517 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES EMPLOYERS A LITTLE

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:14.851 region:rollup2
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND. I'M

00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:16.987 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHAT STEPS TO TAKE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:22.426 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GET THAT FINAL

00:59:16.987 --> 00:59:24.928 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION REPORT.

00:59:22.426 --> 00:59:26.229 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION ADVICE

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:27.531 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A VERY LONG DOCUMENT

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:30.267 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY IT'S EIGHT AND A HALF

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:32.135 region:rollup2
PAGES BUT. WE TRY TO HIT THAT.

00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:33.570 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO HAVE THE GREATEST HITS

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:35.105 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:37.140 region:rollup2
ON THESE ARE REALLY TOUGH YOU

00:59:35.105 --> 00:59:38.508 region:rollup2
MIGHT SEE THEM. AND THEY SHOULD

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.477 region:rollup2
BE INVESTIGATED THEY SHOULD NOT

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:41.545 region:rollup2
DIE ON THE VINE. BUT THE WAY

00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:44.047 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE INVESTIGATED WILL

00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:44.681 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON THE ALLEGATIONS AND

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.715 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE ALLEGATIONS ARE SO

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:47.084 region:rollup2
VAGUE.

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.185 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN'T CONDUCT AN

00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:49.853 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION SOMETIMES THE

00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:51.321 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS ARE VERY SPECIFIC

00:59:49.853 --> 00:59:52.422 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN.

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.491 region:rollup2
OFTEN WHAT CAN BE DONE IF YOU'RE

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:56.259 region:rollup2
GETTING ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AS

00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:57.761 region:rollup2
SOMETHING'S GOING ON. I'M YOU

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:59.062 region:rollup2
CAN CONDUCT WHAT'S CALLED AN

00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.331 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OR

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.932 region:rollup2
SURVEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:04.134 region:rollup2
ARE THINKING.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.035 region:rollup2
I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.736 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S GOING TO STIR THE

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:08.472 region:rollup2
POT BUT SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH IT

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:10.674 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES IT'S A GOOD. THING

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:12.175 region:rollup2
FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DO BECAUSE

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:14.444 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:16.379 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING SOMETHING.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:19.249 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IF.

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.817 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I THINK THAT. THERE'S

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:23.220 region:rollup2
A TYPO HERE RATHER THAN TARGET

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:24.754 region:rollup2
IT SOULD BE I'M THE PERSON WHO

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.424 region:rollup2
IS THE ACT.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:29.159 region:rollup2
LEVELING THE ACCUSATION.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:30.660 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT IS THAT WRITING ME.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.895 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK OF THE TARGET IS

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.697 region:rollup2
THAT IS A PERSON WHO IS MAKING

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:35.265 region:rollup2
THE ACAPELLA TARGET OF THE

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:37.767 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT BY SEA GOT IT GOT IT

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:39.970 region:rollup2
NOT THE TARGET OF THAT. YES

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:41.204 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS GOT IT I'M SOMETIMES

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:44.508 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ASK YOU NOT TO TAKE ANY

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:45.175 region:rollup2
ACTION. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:46.610 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:48.078 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I TELL PEOPLE IS THAT

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.580 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLY

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:52.749 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT. SITUATION IT INVOLVES

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.584 region:rollup2
A VERY HUMAN CONSIDERATIONS.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:56.319 region:rollup2
.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:59.155 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY IF THE ACCUSATION

01:00:56.319 --> 01:01:01.258 region:rollup2
IS RELATIVELY MINOR THAN. YOU

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:02.792 region:rollup2
KNOW COUNSELING WHATEVER. THERE

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:05.362 region:rollup2
ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT YOU

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:06.796 region:rollup2
CAN DO AS AN EMPLOYER TO KIND OF

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:09.199 region:rollup2
REMEDY A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:11.134 region:rollup2
FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE. I'M WITHOUT

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:12.936 region:rollup2
TAKING FURTHER ACTION IF. IF THE

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:14.738 region:rollup2
ACCUSATION IS VERY SERIOUS AND

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2
WOULD IF TRUE BE A VIOLATION OF

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:17.974 region:rollup2
LAW THAN FAILING TO TAKE ACTION

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:19.509 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU KNOW ABOUT IT CAN

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.478 region:rollup2
EXPOSE THE BODIES TO LIABILITY.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:23.046 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SAID THERE ARE VERY

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:24.281 region:rollup2
HUMAN REASONS WHY PEOPLE DON'T

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:27.184 region:rollup2
WANT ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN VERY

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:27.517 region:rollup2
HUMAN REASONS WHY AN EMPLOYER

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.253 region:rollup2
MIGHT DECIDE.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:32.422 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:35.125 region:rollup2
RETALIATION IS COVERED OBVIOUSLY

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:36.259 region:rollup2
OF MENTIONED IT. AND.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.461 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT I JUST WANNA

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.996 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT ON THIS LAST OF THE

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:41.865 region:rollup2
SLIDES THAT I HAD IS. THE

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:43.867 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE TO MONITOR TO KEEP

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:45.302 region:rollup2
MONITORING. I'M INTO CHECK BACK

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.437 region:rollup2
IN WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEVELED

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.004 region:rollup2
ACCUSATIONS OF. MISCONDUCT TO

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.839 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:52.175 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING RETALIATION BECAUSE

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:53.410 region:rollup2
IF THEY ARE. THEY'RE VERY

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.744 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO COME FORWARD AGAIN

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.312 region:rollup2
AND TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.347 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT YOU

01:01:55.312 --> 01:02:00.016 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:01:57.347 --> 01:02:01.718 region:rollup2
SO REACHING BACK OUT TO SOMEONE

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:03.820 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THEIR ACCUSATIONS

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
WERE SUBSTANTIATED OVER THE

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.855 region:rollup2
COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION TO

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:07.724 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:11.027 region:rollup2
OKAY IS A VERY WISE THING FOR

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:11.595 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO DO.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:13.863 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW SORT OF SEGUEING

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:16.233 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:17.634 region:rollup2
.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:21.304 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE DFG AGE

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:22.606 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES WHICH I. WAS HAD THE

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.774 region:rollup2
PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON.

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:26.176 region:rollup2
MY BACKGROUND IS HAVING BEEN A

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:28.078 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY IN THE

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.879 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES DOING US SEXUAL

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:31.214 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CASES ON BEHALF OF

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:33.049 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFFS.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:34.684 region:rollup2
AND THEN BEING INTERESTED IN

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:36.386 region:rollup2
PREVENTION KIND OF WANTING TO

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:38.188 region:rollup2
REVERSE ENGINEER HOW DID THESE

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:40.190 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS GET HERE AND. HOW

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:41.591 region:rollup2
COULD WE DO BETTER TO PREVENT

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:43.360 region:rollup2
AND RESPOND RATHER THAN

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:45.762 region:rollup2
LITIGATING IN MY EXPERIENCE

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.030 region:rollup2
LITIGATION WAS NOT REALLY A VERY

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.332 region:rollup2
GOOD SOLUTION?

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:51.434 region:rollup2
AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF MY

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:53.169 region:rollup2
CAREER I HAVE.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:54.904 region:rollup2

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:12.389 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS AND I

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:14.057 region:rollup2
GAVE YOU THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES

AND I'VE TESTIFIED AS AN EXPERT

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:20.697 region:rollup2
ON MANY OCCASIONS ABOUT

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.731 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS.

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:23.967 region:rollup2
REALLY WITH THE BELIEF THAT.

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:25.302 region:rollup2
.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.337 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SO MANY WORKPLACE

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:29.272 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:31.775 region:rollup2
WITH INTERNALLY YOU CAN'T

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:33.476 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCE ALL OF THEM. AND THE

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:34.577 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB THAT WE CAN DO WITH

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:36.813 region:rollup2
THEM THE BETTER WE CAN MAKE THE

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:38.214 region:rollup2
WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYBODY

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.649 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF POLY

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:41.885 region:rollup2
ANISH BUT.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
AND FIRST JUST WANTED TO

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:44.788 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WORK IS

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:46.289 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT WORK AND REALLY

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:48.658 region:rollup2
APPRECIATING THAT YOU'RE TAKING

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:50.160 region:rollup2
THE TIME TO LISTEN. TO SO MANY

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.061 region:rollup2
OPINIONS AND MAKE CAREFUL

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.329 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:56.366 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:58.802 region:rollup2
INFORMS MY WORK IS. THAT.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:04:00.804 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T PREVENT BET WRONG DOERS

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:03.173 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:05.108 region:rollup2
STOP THE THE HIGHER OR THE

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:07.010 region:rollup2
ELECTION OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BE

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:10.714 region:rollup2
BULLIES AND AND MAY DO THINGS

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:11.815 region:rollup2
THAT. WE WOULD NEVER CONDONE BUT

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:13.683 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:16.853 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:19.856 region:rollup2
AN INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE MAKES

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:22.592 region:rollup2
A HUGE DIFFERENCE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:24.227 region:rollup2
DO NOT GET A GOOD INSTITUTIONAL

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.795 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ARE FURTHER HARM.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
WHO DO GET A GOOD INSTITUTIONAL

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:29.833 region:rollup2
RESPONSE MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.400 region:rollup2
TO? GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES IN

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.736 region:rollup2
THEIR JOBS IN A POSITIVE WAY

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.770 region:rollup2
AND.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:35.538 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STUDIES ON

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:38.875 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL BETRAYAL AND AND

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:41.478 region:rollup2
HOW IT EXACERBATES TRAUMA. AND

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:43.880 region:rollup2
SO I I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:46.249 region:rollup2
AND AND COME TO IT WITH THAT. IN

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.450 region:rollup2
MIND.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:49.419 region:rollup2
I LISTEN TO THE PAST.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:51.654 region:rollup2
.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:53.323 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AND. PUT TOGETHER SORT

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:55.325 region:rollup2
OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND POINTS

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:58.094 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:59.295 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS NOT

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:00.997 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:02.399 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:04.134 region:rollup2
COME?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:06.403 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:07.604 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE IN MAKING SURE THAT.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:10.473 region:rollup2
THEIR THOUGHT THROUGH.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:12.075 region:rollup2
.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:14.511 region:rollup2
WE I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:16.246 region:rollup2
AT BOTH THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.881 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO WAS THE TARGET AND

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.783 region:rollup2
ALSO THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:20.350 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:22.752 region:rollup2
AND.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:24.487 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICIES

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.722 region:rollup2
AND PROCEDURES THEY HAVE TO BE

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:28.725 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HOLD BOTH OF THOSE

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:29.926 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES. IN MIND.

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:32.462 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU HAVE

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.797 region:rollup2
TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:36.432 region:rollup2
WHILE AN AND I'D LIKE TO.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:38.635 region:rollup2
IS REARED IN SCALE OF SEXUAL

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:40.703 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT AND SO I'M USING THAT

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:42.405 region:rollup2
IN SOME OF THE TERMS THAT. THAT

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:45.542 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SCALED WE ARE TALKING

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:46.843 region:rollup2
ABOUT. REALLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:48.845 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:49.679 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO MYSTERIES CUES AND

01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:51.147 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:52.749 region:rollup2
ELSE WHO'S WHO SEXUALLY

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:55.785 region:rollup2
ASSAULTED SOMEBODY THESE ARE

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:59.789 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:06:01.491 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE SITUATIONS THAT. I

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.359 region:rollup2
GET AS AN INVESTIGATOR.

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:05.895 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ON THAT LEVEL OF

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:07.363 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS MIS I MEAN I AM. I

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:08.965 region:rollup2
HAVE CERTAINLY INVESTIGATED MANY

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:12.402 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:14.237 region:rollup2
BUT NOT FIFTY PERCENT MAY BE TEN

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:16.539 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WHAT I INVESTIGATE IS

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:17.874 region:rollup2
AT THAT LEVEL. MOST OF THE

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.909 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:22.679 region:rollup2
BE CONTENDING WITH. ARE NOT

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:24.814 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE AT THAT AT A SERIOUS

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:26.583 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF EGREGIOUS MIS.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.851 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ALSO TALK

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:30.186 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT FALSE CLAIMS

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:31.387 region:rollup2
THERE ARE VERY FEW FALSE CLAIMS.

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:32.822 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTANDING.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:37.827 region:rollup2
MISINTERPRETATIONS POOR MEMORIES

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATIONS TAKING SOMETHING

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:42.432 region:rollup2
OUT OF CONTEXT SO.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.934 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF TALKING

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:46.603 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL CASE BUT

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:50.473 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MAKING POLICIES.

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:52.575 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF THESE CASES WHICH ARE

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:54.310 region:rollup2
MORE TYPICALLY.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:56.679 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE MORE GARDEN VARIETY

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:58.281 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU'RE INSTITUTING A

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:00.717 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS HEARING DOES THAT

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:02.752 region:rollup2
MEAN EVERY CASE GETS A DUE

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.287 region:rollup2
PROCESS HEARING BY A PANEL. AND

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:06.256 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE FALL OUT OF THAT

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:08.791 region:rollup2
BOTH FINANCIALLY AND IN THE

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:10.894 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. I MEAN REALLY WORK

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:13.396 region:rollup2
COULD GRIND TO A HALT IF THAT

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:15.164 region:rollup2
WAS THE CASE AND.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:16.699 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BECOME THE ONLY THING

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:18.735 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT AND

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:20.570 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT AND AND YET THERE

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:22.405 region:rollup2
ARE CASES THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.939 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAVE. THAT KIND OF

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:27.577 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:29.345 region:rollup2
.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:31.781 region:rollup2
IS THERE A MINIMUM BAR FOR

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:33.283 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.717 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I YOU I TRAIN PEOPLE

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:37.020 region:rollup2
YOU INVESTIGATE SOMETHING THAT

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:39.289 region:rollup2
IF.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.924 region:rollup2
IF TRUE WOULD BE A SERIOUS

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:43.626 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES AND

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:46.296 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:47.430 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE CONTESTED FAX IT

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:48.698 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE THE PEOPLE AGREE ABOUT

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.500 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED THEN YOU DON'T

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:53.002 region:rollup2
HAVE TO INVESTIGATE IT.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.038 region:rollup2
BUT HOW SO HOW SERIOUS VIOLATION

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:57.941 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING HAVE TO BE.

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:58.708 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SCALE.

01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:01.411 region:rollup2
EVEN THE FIRST SCALE OF.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:04.714 region:rollup2
.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:06.716 region:rollup2
OF CONDUCT NON OFFENSIVE.

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:09.252 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:11.621 region:rollup2
MY COWORKER TELLING ME YOU LOOK

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:13.122 region:rollup2
LOVELY IS OFFENSIVE AND THAT I

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.157 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT HARASSMENT I WANT

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:17.260 region:rollup2
TO INVESTIGATE IT.

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:18.795 region:rollup2
AND.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.297 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD COME UNDER THE

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:24.400 region:rollup2
SCALE OF A MINOR.

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:26.069 region:rollup2
ARE NOT OFFENSIVE COMMENT.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.170 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU INVESTIGATED HOW DO

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:29.172 region:rollup2
YOU DETERMINE THAT.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.341 region:rollup2
.

01:08:29.172 --> 01:08:33.142 region:rollup2
WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT'S GOING

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.743 region:rollup2
TO BE INVESTIGATED?

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:36.212 region:rollup2
AND.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:38.114 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF WHAT

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.548 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE HEARINGS ABOUT SCOPE

01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:41.117 region:rollup2
THE SAYING THAT THE

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:42.385 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD ANYTHING

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:46.556 region:rollup2
TO THE SCOPE AND MY PRACTICE

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.858 region:rollup2
THAT'S UP TO MY CLIENT.

01:08:46.556 --> 01:08:50.893 region:rollup2
IF IT'S UP TO ME IS THAT LIKE

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:52.528 region:rollup2
THE FULL IMPLEMENT ACT OF

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.930 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. OF TWO THOUSAND

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:55.598 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN FOR ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:58.568 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS GOING

01:08:55.598 --> 01:09:00.970 region:rollup2
ON. YOU HAVE TO REALLY PUT A LOT

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:02.705 region:rollup2
OF TRUST IN THE INVESTIGATOR IF

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.973 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO DETERMINE IT. I

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:06.809 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE CAN BE

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:08.111 region:rollup2
MISTRUST THAT. THINGS ARE GONNA

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.679 region:rollup2
COME UP THE NEW PLAYER IS NOT

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:11.948 region:rollup2
GOING TO DEAL WITH SO HOW CAN

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:13.983 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE. A PROCESS THAT PEOPLE

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:15.351 region:rollup2
WILL TRUST BUT THAT STILL GIVES

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:17.553 region:rollup2
YOU SOME CONTROL OF THAT.

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:19.489 region:rollup2
AND.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:21.858 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS IS IMPACTING PEOPLE

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:23.559 region:rollup2
AT WORK EVERY DAY. GOING THROUGH

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:25.595 region:rollup2
AN INVESTIGATION FOR THE

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:27.530 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT FOR THE RESPONDENT FOR

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:29.432 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE WITNESSES AND ALL THE

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:32.335 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE CALLED AS WITNESSES.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:33.803 region:rollup2
IS ANXIETY PRODUCING IT'S TIME

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:36.039 region:rollup2
CONSUMING.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:38.074 region:rollup2
IT CAN'T HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS

01:09:36.039 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANT AND SO ALL. ALL OF

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:41.878 region:rollup2
THIS IS DISRUPTIVE AND DIFFICULT

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:43.980 region:rollup2
TO YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES

01:09:41.878 --> 01:09:45.915 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN IS IT WORTH.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.884 region:rollup2
THAT DESTRUCTION AND ARE THERE

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:49.452 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:52.522 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT. THAT WOULD BE A

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:56.726 region:rollup2
CREDIBLE WAY OF HANDLING IT.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:57.794 region:rollup2
.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:00.096 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:09:57.794 --> 01:10:02.632 region:rollup2
ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY WHO GETS

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:04.967 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:07.270 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS ALWAYS

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:08.337 region:rollup2
WITNESSES WHO IN YOU YOU TALK TO

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.440 region:rollup2
WITNESSES WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:11.074 region:rollup2
RETALIATION SOMETIMES THEY'RE

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.742 region:rollup2
WORRIED THAT THE PERSON WHO'S

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:13.810 region:rollup2
ACCUSED IS GOING TO RETALIATE

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.044 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEY'RE WORRIED. THE

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:17.213 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATION

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:18.815 region:rollup2
IS GONNA RETALIATE THESE ARE

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.450 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:23.086 region:rollup2
THEIR CAMPS AT WORK.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:25.121 region:rollup2
AND. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:26.989 region:rollup2
REVEALING THE REPORT.

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:28.624 region:rollup2

WORKING FOR THEM AND SO. THERE'S

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.943 region:rollup2
NOT A HUGE UNIVERSE I MEAN IN

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:23.679 region:rollup2
MOST WORK ENVIRONMENTS THERE'S

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:25.481 region:rollup2
NOT A HUGE UNIVERSE AND SO. YOU

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.082 region:rollup2

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:32.121 region:rollup2
SO WIDE ACCESS TO THIS

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.688 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON THE ONE HAND YOUR

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.924 region:rollup2

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:36.425 region:rollup2
YOU'RE. LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:38.194 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TAKING THESE SERIOUSLY

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:39.862 region:rollup2
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:43.032 region:rollup2
FALL OUT ON PEOPLE AT WORK DAY

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:44.600 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:46.068 region:rollup2
AS YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.204 region:rollup2
IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S A

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:49.572 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:51.908 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE THE

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:53.376 region:rollup2
SITUATION WITH ANY THE ELECTED.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:55.912 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THAT

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:57.146 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I'VE

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:59.749 region:rollup2
DONE INVESTIGATIONS.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:02.318 region:rollup2
INVOLVING ELECTED OFFICIALS.

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:03.252 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.687 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT YOU DON'T

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:09.158 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LIMITS ON.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:11.127 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:12.361 region:rollup2
AND. I.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:14.430 region:rollup2
TREATING THEM DIFFERENTLY WOULD

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:16.232 region:rollup2
MAKE SENSE TO ME IN TERMS OF

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:18.901 region:rollup2
FASHIONING THESE SO THAT YOU

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:20.536 region:rollup2
BOTH HAVE. A DIFFERENT PROCESS

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.638 region:rollup2
ELECTED NON ELECTED AND A

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:25.575 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROCESS DEPENDING ON

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:28.110 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY. OF THE ALLEGATION

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:29.378 region:rollup2
AND AND THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
THAT IT COULD LEAD TO.

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:35.017 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:36.819 region:rollup2
JUST TO SORT OF TALK FOR A

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:38.855 region:rollup2
MINUTE ABOUT THE WHOLE. RIGHT

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:40.389 region:rollup2
AND WRONG IN A WINNER LOSER

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.691 region:rollup2
PARADIGM THAT WE GET INTO WITH

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:43.226 region:rollup2
THIS WHICH.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.228 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE ARE HARVEY

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:47.029 region:rollup2
WEINSTEIN'S AND RIGHT AND WRONG

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:49.165 region:rollup2
IS JUST ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
IS NO QUESTION.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:53.002 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WHEN WE GET INVOLVED

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:55.538 region:rollup2
IN INVESTIGATING THESE

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:58.874 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS. IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:59.675 region:rollup2
CLEAR. SURE THERE ARE SOMETIMES.

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:02.111 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:04.780 region:rollup2
AS THERE ARE ARE SERIOUS

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:07.717 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE SITUATIONS.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.085 region:rollup2
AND YET THE MAJORITY.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.553 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:13.022 region:rollup2
AT ONE TIME AND AREN'T CLOSE

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:14.390 region:rollup2
ANYMORE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:17.660 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:19.629 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE VERY. ONGOING

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.631 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS THAT

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:23.332 region:rollup2
WE WALK INTO THE MIDDLE OF AND

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.334 region:rollup2
THEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:27.136 region:rollup2
AND SO AND I KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:29.038 region:rollup2
GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU'RE GONNA

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:30.606 region:rollup2
HEAR NEXT ABOUT RESTORATIVE

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:31.207 region:rollup2
JUSTICE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.409 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY GETS LOST IN THIS

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:34.977 region:rollup2
IS.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:37.146 region:rollup2
OTHER SOLUTIONS AND FOR THE

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:39.548 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. CAN WE EVER USE

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:41.584 region:rollup2
MEDIATION IN SITUATIONS THAT ARE

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:43.052 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS CAN WE EVER. GET

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:44.921 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TALKING TO EACH OTHER

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:46.822 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. THIS KIND OF

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.124 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:50.226 region:rollup2
IT WAS EITHER FOUNDED OR NOT

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:52.228 region:rollup2
FOUNDED AND THEN PEOPLE MOVE ON

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.696 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THEIR RIGHTS OR THEY

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:55.431 region:rollup2
THEY AREN'T HURT.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:58.501 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE A LOT OF

01:13:55.431 --> 01:14:00.770 region:rollup2
THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:02.405 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU GET A PROCESS FOR

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.906 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS. YOU

01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:05.341 region:rollup2
END UP GETTING COMPLAINTS THEY

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.575 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY BELONG HERE BECAUSE

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:08.277 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL HEARD ANYWHERE

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:10.780 region:rollup2
ELSE.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:13.015 region:rollup2
AND SO THE SAME TIME. IF YOU CAN

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:16.018 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO AIR

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:17.720 region:rollup2
GRIEVANCES. AND HEAR EACH OTHER

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:19.388 region:rollup2
AND TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.357 region:rollup2
OFF OF THIS SYSTEM. THAT WOULD

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:24.160 region:rollup2
BE A GOOD THING.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:25.294 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.629 region:rollup2
I AGREE ENTIRELY WITH THAT I

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.630 region:rollup2
JUST WANNA ADD.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.699 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT WHICH IS

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.199 region:rollup2
FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:31.167 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AN

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.368 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:34.170 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER

01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
THEY DOCTORED REASONABLY ONE OF

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT'S A RED FLAG FOR

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:38.341 region:rollup2
US ISIF THEY HAVEN'T ACTED

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:40.142 region:rollup2
DECISIVELY IN THOSE FEW

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:41.811 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS AS FEW COMPLAINTS

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.878 region:rollup2
WHEN IT IS CLEAR. RIGHT WHEN

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.547 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:47.950 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL ASSAULT FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:51.253 region:rollup2
SO BUNDLING THOSE. TEN PERCENT

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:53.956 region:rollup2
OF THE CASES. TOTALLY UNDERMINES

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:55.925 region:rollup2
FAITH THAT THERE CAN BE A MORE

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:59.128 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE.

01:14:55.925 --> 01:15:00.696 region:rollup2
A MORE NUANCED. APPROACH TO THE

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.931 region:rollup2
LESS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS WHAT'S

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:04.367 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THE

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:05.201 region:rollup2
SERIOUS CASES RIGHT AND IF AN

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:07.136 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER CAN GET THE SERIOUS

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
CASES RIGHT. AND THERE'S A LOT

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:12.174 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH BROUGHT BY ALL

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:13.109 region:rollup2
PARTIES IN RESOLVING GUY

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.044 region:rollup2
COMPLAINS THAT.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:16.278 region:rollup2
MAY OR MAY NOT RISE TO THE

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:19.782 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF A VIOLATION OF THE LAW

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:20.349 region:rollup2
OR THE POLICY BUT NONETHELESS

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:20.649 region:rollup2
ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS IN THE

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.518 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:23.953 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.688 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:27.223 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE IT'S I DON'T. I

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:29.058 region:rollup2
DON'T LIKE WHAT ARE CALLED ZERO

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:31.527 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE POLICIES UNLESS IT'S

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:32.661 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT WHAT IT MEANS IS.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.830 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:36.866 region:rollup2
RESPONDED TO.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:38.968 region:rollup2
IT'S TOO OFTEN UNDERSTOOD TO

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:41.370 region:rollup2
MEAN ANYBODY WHO CROSSES THIS

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:43.439 region:rollup2
LINE WILL BE TERMINATED AND AND.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:45.641 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A PROBLEM.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:47.043 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY POLICY SAYS IT DOES

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.778 region:rollup2
HAVE A STRICTER STANDARD THAN

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.446 region:rollup2
THE LAW.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:52.014 region:rollup2
AND IT USES THE TERM ZERO HOT

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:54.350 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE BUT THEN IT GOES ON TO

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:56.252 region:rollup2
DEFINE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:57.686 region:rollup2
MOST NARROW OF WAYS REPEATING

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.454 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL DEFINITION SO THAT

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:01.223 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN INTERNAL

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:02.024 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTION THERE.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.492 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING WITH TWO

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:05.428 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ONE OF

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:07.830 region:rollup2
THEM. HAS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:09.732 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT YOU HAVE TO IT HAS

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:11.500 region:rollup2
TO BE FOR SEVERE PERVASIVE SO IT

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.668 region:rollup2
EXACTLY MIRRORS THE LAW.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.236 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE HAS A SEXUAL

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.737 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT POLICY THAT DOESN'T

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.105 region:rollup2
EVEN SAY IT HAS TO BE ON

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.273 region:rollup2
WELCOME.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.742 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST ANYTHING THAT'S

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:21.710 region:rollup2
UNPROFESSIONAL.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:23.079 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THE USER.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:25.247 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.316 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.984 region:rollup2
IN THE ON THE ONE HAND. PEOPLE

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:30.119 region:rollup2
MIGHT GET TERMINATED FIRST FOR

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:31.821 region:rollup2
SOMETHING QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:33.155 region:rollup2
UNPROFESSIONAL BECAUSE IT

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
VIOLATES THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:36.258 region:rollup2
POLICY. AND IF OU MAKE A

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:38.961 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT SOMETHING VIOLATES

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.995 region:rollup2
A CIGARETTE POLICY INFERENCES

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.964 region:rollup2
THIS WAS SERIOUS.

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:43.532 region:rollup2
AND YET IT WAS SIMPLY SOMETHING

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:45.201 region:rollup2
QUOTE ON QUOTE AND PROFESSIONAL.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:47.536 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU MAY GET

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.838 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO DOES THINGS THAT

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:51.507 region:rollup2
WOULD CLEARLY VIOLATE YOUR

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:53.676 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:16:51.507 --> 01:16:56.111 region:rollup2
MADE A LEGAL DEFINITION. OF

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:57.413 region:rollup2
SEVERE PERVASIVE AND IT LOOKS

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.048 region:rollup2
LIKE UNDER YOUR POLICY YOU

01:16:57.413 --> 01:17:01.083 region:rollup2
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING AND AND SO

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:04.220 region:rollup2
I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:06.355 region:rollup2
CLARIFY. THOSE POLICIES.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.690 region:rollup2
.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:10.025 region:rollup2
I ALREADY TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:11.894 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THIS THE CONFIDENTIALITY

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:13.662 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:15.397 region:rollup2
IT IS GOING TO IMPACT. EVERYBODY

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:18.033 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:20.202 region:rollup2
IT MAY ALSO IMPACT HOW THE

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.737 region:rollup2
REPORT IS WRITTEN.

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:24.206 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE FULL

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:25.941 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO A REPORT.

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:27.476 region:rollup2
I MIGHT.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:29.879 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:31.514 region:rollup2
REALLY EXPLOSIVE FACT FOR PEOPLE

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:33.516 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE IT MAKES SOMEBODY

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:35.251 region:rollup2
MORE OR LESS CLINICAL GUILTY BUT

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:36.785 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. IT WOULD BE HIGHLY

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:39.054 region:rollup2
EMBARRASSING TO SOMEBODY WHO

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.922 region:rollup2
ISN'T EVEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AND

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:41.323 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NEED TO BE HIGHLY

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:43.425 region:rollup2
EMBARRASSED.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:45.961 region:rollup2
AND SO I.

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:47.696 region:rollup2
THE FEAR IS THAT OF CENSORING.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:49.932 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE SUCH WIDE ACCESS TO

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:52.101 region:rollup2
THE REPORT.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:53.168 region:rollup2
.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:54.503 region:rollup2
I KNOW THERE WAS A THERE'S BEEN

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:57.006 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:58.874 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES AND I

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:01.844 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC POLICY

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:03.579 region:rollup2
ISSUE. I ALSO KNOW AS AN

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:05.147 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY.

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:06.882 region:rollup2
THEN AGAIN YOU GET A LOT OF

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:08.617 region:rollup2
CASES THAT ARE NOT.

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:10.486 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS AND THAT COULD

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:12.721 region:rollup2
SETTLE WITH A CONFIDENTIALITY

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:13.255 region:rollup2
CLAUSE AND EVEN PLAINTIFF'S

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.190 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY WOULD LIKE IT TO

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.157 region:rollup2
SETTLE.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:17.326 region:rollup2
FOR THE PLAINTIFF WOULD LIKE TO

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:19.328 region:rollup2
SETTLE SO IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:21.163 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE. THOSE

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:22.731 region:rollup2
CASES MAY LITIGATE.

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:24.166 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING I

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:25.868 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT'S AGAIN SORT OF THE

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.803 region:rollup2
LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:29.138 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE.

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:30.839 region:rollup2
TARGETS OF HARASSMENT WHO WERE

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:32.775 region:rollup2
TOLD.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:35.678 region:rollup2
YES WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR YOU

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:36.745 region:rollup2
WE CAN RESOLVE YOUR CASE BUT.

01:18:35.678 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
ONLY IF WE DO KEEP IT

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:40.950 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL OTHERWISE THIS IS

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:42.785 region:rollup2
GOING TO TRIAL.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:44.553 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE THE BEST

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:46.789 region:rollup2
OPTION.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:48.123 region:rollup2
RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO ADD A NOTE

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
OF CAUTION THERE THAT END UP IN

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:51.393 region:rollup2
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ANYTHING

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:53.095 region:rollup2
THAT WE SIGN IS DEFINITION ONLY.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:55.130 region:rollup2
NOT CONFIDENTIAL SO ANY STATE

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:55.931 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER. I. STATE DEPARTMENT

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.333 region:rollup2
THAT REACHES A ETTLEMENT THAT

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:58.200 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT UNDER THE PUBLIC

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
RECORDS ACT REQUEST AS

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.273 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENCE YET CONFIDENTIAL.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:04.506 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT EMPIRICAL REALITY

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.808 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:07.977 region:rollup2
.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:10.980 region:rollup2
I HAVE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HOW

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:11.580 region:rollup2
MUCH CONFIDENTIALITY MATTERS. I

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.414 region:rollup2
THINK THE CASE IS SETTLED OR

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.817 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:16.785 region:rollup2
EYES CERTAINLY AGREED THAT IT

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:18.420 region:rollup2
CAN BE EASIER TO SETTLE A CASE

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:20.456 region:rollup2
WITH CONFIDENTIALITY OF ALL THE

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.524 region:rollup2
PARTIES AGREE BUT HAVING THAT

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:24.093 region:rollup2
OPTION OFF THE TABLE. HAS NOT

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:26.996 region:rollup2
BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MATED.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:28.497 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO SETTLE CASES EVEN

01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:31.467 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE MINOR CASES WELL

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:32.034 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW AND I

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:32.935 region:rollup2
DON'T MIND BEING WRONG ABOUT

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:36.405 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:36.605 region:rollup2
THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:39.074 region:rollup2
WHEN.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:41.076 region:rollup2
.

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:42.278 region:rollup2
MOSTLY WHEN THIS IS OUTSOURCES

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:44.747 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCED TO ATTORNEYS AND WITH

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.014 region:rollup2
IT I HAVE A SLIGHT ABOUT THAT

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:46.515 region:rollup2
LATER BUT.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:47.483 region:rollup2
.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:49.485 region:rollup2
MOSTLY IT'S DONE UNDER THE

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:51.420 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE I KNOW

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:53.856 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT THERE ARE THERE'S AN

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.190 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT FOR BUT THAT MEANS YOU

01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.992 region:rollup2
COULD BE HIDING INFORMATION IT

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:58.894 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DONE. AS A NON

01:19:56.992 --> 01:20:01.130 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGED INVESTIGATION. AND IN

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:03.032 region:rollup2
FACT IF IT'S USED AS A DEFENSE

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.333 region:rollup2
THEN THE ENTITY HAS TO WAIVE THE

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:06.068 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:08.937 region:rollup2
THE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:10.773 region:rollup2
THAT. AS AN INVESTIGATOR I WANT

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:12.775 region:rollup2
YOU TO GIVE ME VERY WIDE

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:14.043 region:rollup2
INFORMATION I WANT YOU TO OPEN

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:16.445 region:rollup2
UP EVERYTHING TO ME.

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:18.147 region:rollup2
AND.

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:18.714 region:rollup2
MY CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO DO

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.915 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:22.217 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:23.886 region:rollup2
IT'S A PRIVILEGE.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:25.087 region:rollup2
I MAY FIND SOMETHING OUT THAT

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:26.388 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH CURRENT

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:28.791 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:31.160 region:rollup2
AND MOVE THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:33.595 region:rollup2
THEN THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING WENT

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.564 region:rollup2
TO TRIAL IT COULD BE KEPT AS.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:36.665 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PRIVILEGE.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:38.267 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS A PRIVILEGE

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.935 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IF IT'S NOT DONE

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:41.370 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PRIVILEGE MIGHT IT

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.738 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IS EXPOSING THAT

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.240 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. TO THE PUBLIC

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:48.110 region:rollup2
SCRUTINY.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.545 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT FIND. THAT.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.146 region:rollup2
ENTITIES GENERALLY IF THEY'RE

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:52.915 region:rollup2
NOT DOING THIS UNDER THE

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:55.184 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. MAY

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:57.286 region:rollup2
NOT BE AS GENEROUS WITH THE

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:59.755 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT. WE AS

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:01.323 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEM TO BE.

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:03.392 region:rollup2
AND SO AGAIN THAT MIGHT BE AN

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:05.260 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT.

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:06.929 region:rollup2
.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.131 region:rollup2
COULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO REALLY

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:11.934 region:rollup2
GETTING THE INFORMATION TO MAKE

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:15.237 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT FIND.

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:19.341 region:rollup2
I THINK WE I TALKED ABOUT SCOPE

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:19.341 region:rollup2
ALREADY I DON'T KNOW.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:22.911 region:rollup2
.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:24.413 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:26.915 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE LIMITING.

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:28.684 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINTS TO ONE YEAR WHICH

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:30.352 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH BUT THEN

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:31.720 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:32.521 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.058 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:37.426 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED REGARDLESS OF.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:38.694 region:rollup2
WHEN THE COMPLAINT EMANATED

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:40.729 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:42.398 region:rollup2
AT THE SERIOUSNESS.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.999 region:rollup2
IF IF WE ASSUME THAT YOU'RE

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:46.635 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A SERIOUS SEXUAL

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:48.003 region:rollup2
ASSAULT I. TOTALLY AGREE.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:49.304 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:51.039 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT ARE NOT THAT

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:53.709 region:rollup2
SERIOUS. AND IF YOU'RE GONNA GO

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:55.244 region:rollup2
BACK TEN TWENTY YEARS.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:57.246 region:rollup2
IN A COMPLAINT THAT INVOLVES

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.981 region:rollup2
PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T EVEN

01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:00.082 region:rollup2
HERE OR SOME WITNESSES WHO ARE

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:02.684 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:04.353 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF EVENTS THAT

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:06.722 region:rollup2
ARE AMBIGUOUS IT'S GOING TO BE.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:08.023 region:rollup2
MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE A FINDING

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:09.658 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:11.593 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE WORTH IT

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:12.861 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO DO THAT SO. YOU CAN I

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:15.130 region:rollup2
THINK HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:17.399 region:rollup2
DISCRETION.

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:19.201 region:rollup2
WHEN DETERMINING HOW WHETHER TO

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:20.869 region:rollup2
GO FURTHER BACK IN A PARTICULAR

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:22.404 region:rollup2
CASE CERTAINLY A YEAR IS VERY

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:24.640 region:rollup2
SHORT.

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:26.809 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME THOUGH AND AND

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.410 region:rollup2
TWO SHORT I THINK.

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.978 region:rollup2
THE AND NOT THE ISSUE THE

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:32.714 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS I THINK

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:33.816 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT'S TRICKY HERE IS IS

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:36.452 region:rollup2
WHAT KEVIN WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:37.453 region:rollup2
EARLIER. IT'S NOT THE COMPLAINT.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:39.521 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.789 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING BECAUSE THEN YOU

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:42.257 region:rollup2
JUST GO FORWARD?

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.525 region:rollup2
IT'S THE COMPLAINT WHERE YOU DO

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:45.227 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO'S COMPLAINING BUT THEY

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:46.728 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO KNOW

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:48.297 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GO

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:50.199 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.766 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT YOU NEED THERE

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:54.670 region:rollup2
IS CLARITY IN YOUR POLICIES

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:56.104 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.406 region:rollup2
I KNOW YOU HAVE A WE'VE THAT

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:59.174 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN GO TO AND KEP IT

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:00.943 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF YOU WANT TO

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:02.311 region:rollup2
KEEP THIS CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S

01:23:00.943 --> 01:23:03.679 region:rollup2
YOUR ROUTE.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:06.448 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE WE

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:08.784 region:rollup2
CAN'T KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. AND

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:10.652 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY AND USUALLY THAT

01:23:08.784 --> 01:23:13.655 region:rollup2
PERSON EVENTUALLY WHAT WILL COME

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.857 region:rollup2
AROUND BUT BUT THAT'S REALLY THE

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:18.160 region:rollup2
THE TRICKY ISSUE I THINK.

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:20.329 region:rollup2
.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.831 region:rollup2
I KNOW HE IS ONE OF YOUR BIG

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:23.866 region:rollup2
DECISION POINTS IS WHO IS GOING

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:26.101 region:rollup2
TO DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:27.803 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:30.005 region:rollup2
SHOULD YOU HAVE AN OUTSIDE BODY.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:32.274 region:rollup2
ON.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:34.643 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:36.178 region:rollup2
FOR EVER A HARASSMENT FREE

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:38.046 region:rollup2

HARASSMENT FOR RESPONDING TO

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:41.083 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:43.485 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:45.020 region:rollup2
QUERY WHETHER YOU CAN OUTSOURCE

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:47.256 region:rollup2
THAT AND IF SO WHO YOU WOULD

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:49.625 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCE THAT. TO.

01:23:47.256 --> 01:23:50.726 region:rollup2
.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:52.628 region:rollup2
THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:55.330 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF THIS BUT.

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:57.599 region:rollup2
IN UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:59.201 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:02.070 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS ACT.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:05.107 region:rollup2
MANDATES THAT AN OUTSIDER WHO

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:06.108 region:rollup2
DOES INVESTIGATION HAS TO EITHER

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:08.777 region:rollup2
BE A LICENSED PRIVATE

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:11.446 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR. OR AN ATTORNEY

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:13.982 region:rollup2
ACTING IN HIS OR HER CAPACITY AS

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:15.183 region:rollup2
AN ATTORNEY SO ANYBODY CAN DO IT

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:16.418 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY.

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:17.753 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:19.421 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE WELL TRAINED BECAUSE

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:21.523 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:23.358 region:rollup2
FOR THE INTERNAL FOLKS.

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:25.294 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE GONNA USE AN EXTERNAL

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:27.095 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:28.297 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EITHER USE

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:29.998 region:rollup2
A LICENSED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:31.800 region:rollup2
OF WHOM THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:32.734 region:rollup2
VERY QUALIFIED TO DO THIS THE

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.037 region:rollup2
CURRENT PRESIDENT OF EIGHT OF

INVESTIGATOR NON ATTORNEY.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:40.242 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:41.343 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SMALLER POOL.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:43.312 region:rollup2
OR MOSTLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:44.579 region:rollup2
USING ATTORNEYS WHO SHOULD HAVE

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:46.181 region:rollup2
AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:48.183 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:49.952 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE PRIVILEGED BECAUSE YOU

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:51.386 region:rollup2
CAN WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE. BUT

01:24:49.952 --> 01:24:54.089 region:rollup2
THERE STILL HAS TO BE AN

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:56.491 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CLIENT. RELATIONSHIP.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.893 region:rollup2
NOW. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SETTING

01:24:56.491 --> 01:25:00.562 region:rollup2
UP A COMMISSION I'M NOT AN

EXPERT ON THAT SO YOU KNOW IT'S

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:04.866 region:rollup2
IT'S INTRIGUING.

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:06.668 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN I WOULD.

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:08.637 region:rollup2
IT STILL SEEMS TO ME THAT NINETY

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:11.573 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF YOUR COMPLAINTS ARE

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:13.041 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY.

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:15.944 region:rollup2
EITHER AN INTERNAL PERSON OR AN

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:18.413 region:rollup2

A WHOLE JUDICATA BODY.

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:25.053 region:rollup2
IF YOU SET THAT UP FOR EVERY

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:26.455 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:29.057 region:rollup2
QUITE AN EXPENSIVE AND

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:33.028 region:rollup2
CUMBERSOME PROCESS.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:36.598 region:rollup2
.

RIGHT NOW.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:46.708 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BUYS BECAUSE

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:47.843 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER PAYS AND THAT

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:50.012 region:rollup2

IT'S JUST SORT OF WHAT WE'VE

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:58.720 region:rollup2
GOT.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:26:00.222 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW SOME IDEAS ABOUT

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.491 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND HOW AN INSTITUTION

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:10.832 region:rollup2

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.009 region:rollup2
SO JUST YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE

01:26:20.409 --> 01:26:23.045 region:rollup2
TRY TO TRAIN INVESTIGATORS IN

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:24.613 region:rollup2
IS.

01:26:23.045 --> 01:26:26.481 region:rollup2
THERE AREN'T BAD FACTS THEY'RE

01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:28.283 region:rollup2
JUST FAX AND THAT THAT

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:29.618 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS ARE DOING FACT

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.285 region:rollup2
FINDING.

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:33.088 region:rollup2
AND.

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:34.923 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE WITH A LOT

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:36.725 region:rollup2
OF AUTHORITY.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.893 region:rollup2
OR WHO AND WHO ARE ANSWERING TO

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:39.261 region:rollup2
BE WITH A LOT OF AUTHORITY

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:40.262 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LESS AUTHORITY YOU

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.797 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:42.964 region:rollup2
FEEL BEHOLDEN TO SOMEBODY'S

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:45.467 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW.

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:46.835 region:rollup2
AND BE IMPACTED BY THAT IN WAYS

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:48.036 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE THE INVESTIGATOR

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:50.439 region:rollup2
ISN'T EVEN AWARE.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:52.507 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:54.209 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THAT WAS REALLY REALLY

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:56.645 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY LITTLE A LIMITED IF

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:58.380 region:rollup2
FOR US AND I THINK A LOT OF US

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:59.981 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WONDERING KIND OF. HOW

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.583 region:rollup2
OUR INVESTIGATIONS DYNAMITED THE

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:03.485 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES AND THAT ENTERED

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:05.487 region:rollup2
A LOT AND I I WANT TO CLARIFY

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:06.755 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN I WAS SPEAKING EARLIER

01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:09.357 region:rollup2
ABOUT? YOU KNOW SORT OF AN

01:27:06.755 --> 01:27:11.693 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE BODY I WAS THINKING MORE

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:13.128 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PORTION

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:14.563 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:17.599 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS RETURNED.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:19.468 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT.

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:21.303 region:rollup2
WE CAN AND AND MOST PROBABLY DO

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:22.237 region:rollup2
VERY EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:23.805 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO SERIOUS

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:25.740 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS AT THIS POINT.

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:27.075 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S THE NEXT STEP

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.010 region:rollup2
IN WHEN THAT INVESTIGATION COMES

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.946 region:rollup2
BACK AND WE DO THE FACTUAL TYPE

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.813 region:rollup2
OF. DOMESTICATION WHERE THEY

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:32.948 region:rollup2
DON'T COME BACK AND SAY IT'S

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:34.382 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY COME BACK

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:36.251 region:rollup2
AND THEY SAY WE THINK THIS EVENT

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:37.619 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN THAT ABOUT HAPPENS.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.521 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT NAPS I

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:42.090 region:rollup2
THINK WHEN IT COMES TO MEMBERS

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:44.092 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE?

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.961 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:48.396 region:rollup2
UNDER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WHAT

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:50.732 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AFTER THAT I AND THAT'S

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:52.234 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S A LOT LESS CLEAR TO

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:53.902 region:rollup2
ME ANYWAY AND WHERE I THINK WE

01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:56.071 region:rollup2
REALLY WERE GOING TO NEED TO BE

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:57.906 region:rollup2
DOING QUITE A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:27:56.071 --> 01:28:00.475 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH EMPLOYEES THAT'S. A

01:27:57.906 --> 01:28:03.044 region:rollup2
LOT EASIER BUT WITH ELECTED

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.979 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS SAID IT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:06.948 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE DIFFICULT I HAVE A

01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:08.216 region:rollup2
QUESTION BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.452 region:rollup2
PANEL UP HERE. OUT YOU KNOW WE

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:13.488 region:rollup2
TALKED A LOT ABOUT RETALIATION

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:15.223 region:rollup2
AGAINST WITNESSES RETALIATION

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:17.359 region:rollup2
AGAINST PEOPLE BRINGING CLAIMS

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:20.929 region:rollup2
WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:24.432 region:rollup2
ABOUT RETALIATION TOWARDS PEOPLE

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:26.168 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ACCUSED TOUR THEN. OF

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:29.137 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION COMES BACK AND

01:28:26.168 --> 01:28:35.844 region:rollup2
IT'S EITHER NOT DETERMINATIVE OR

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:37.212 region:rollup2
UNSUBSTANTIATED AND HOW WE. OR

01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:38.480 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT

01:28:37.212 --> 01:28:43.952 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.386 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THE INVESTIGATION

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:45.020 region:rollup2
HAS BECOME PUBLIC.

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:45.687 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU DO I MEAN I THINK

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.188 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY INVOLVED HAS THE SAME

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:49.925 region:rollup2
RIGHTS COMPLAINT IS NOT

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:50.992 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:52.727 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.929 region:rollup2
THAT CONVERSATION. AND TELL

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:55.030 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT TELL THE PEOPLE

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:56.464 region:rollup2
INVOLVED THAT IT'S NOT

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:59.768 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED AND I THINK.

01:28:56.464 --> 01:29:01.736 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF THE. THINGS THAT I'VE

01:28:59.768 --> 01:29:03.071 region:rollup2
SEEN HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE KNOW

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:04.072 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.673 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:06.408 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN THAT LEAVES THIS

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:08.910 region:rollup2
KIND OF CLOUD SUSPICION OVER THE

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:10.011 region:rollup2
ENTIRE THING AND YOU CAN. PLAY A

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:13.014 region:rollup2
ROLE IN REMOVING THAT CLOUD.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:13.982 region:rollup2
BY JUST TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THE

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.952 region:rollup2
RESULT IS.

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:18.887 region:rollup2
I SHOULD MENTION.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.354 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:20.989 region:rollup2
I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.257 region:rollup2
.

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:24.826 region:rollup2
FLY THE TALK REALLY ABOUT THE

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:26.094 region:rollup2
NINETY TEN KIND OF RULE.

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.896 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:30.966 region:rollup2
TO QUOTE YOU SLIDE VERY VERY

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:32.734 region:rollup2
FEW FALSE CLAIMS ALL YOU'LL HEAR

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:34.069 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WE HERE IN THIS

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:38.573 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE NOTION THAT.

01:29:34.069 --> 01:29:40.308 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL DEFAULT TO A CLAIM

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:42.110 region:rollup2
OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT OR

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:43.144 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON BECAUSE

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:45.947 region:rollup2
THEY'RE AND THEY'RE RIGHT A

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:49.885 region:rollup2
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE OR ON A

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:53.355 region:rollup2
MEMBER HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:54.756 region:rollup2
ENGAGING CORRECTIVE ACTION AND

01:29:53.355 --> 01:29:56.758 region:rollup2
MOVE ABOUT AND THEN THAT'S WHEN

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:58.860 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE WILL YOU KNOW SO THAT'S

01:29:56.758 --> 01:30:00.262 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT KIND OF. NOT

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.697 region:rollup2
JUST HERE BUT IN IN THE WORK.

01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:04.065 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER SIDE OF THINGS CAN

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.066 region:rollup2
YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:07.669 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:08.937 region:rollup2
WITH PERCEPTIONS. PERCEPTIONS OF

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:11.773 region:rollup2
VICTIMS PERCEPTIONS OF THE

01:30:08.937 --> 01:30:15.277 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS AND HOW WE DIDN'T.

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:16.711 region:rollup2
GET PAST THOSE PERCEPTIONS TO

01:30:15.277 --> 01:30:18.146 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE THE BRASS TACKS

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:20.882 region:rollup2
THE REALITIES OF WHAT YOU'VE

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:21.850 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED WITH YEARS OF

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:23.251 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND YOUR BELT

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:26.888 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING THESE KINDS OF

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:30.025 region:rollup2
CLAIMS. WELL. I THINK THAT

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:30.558 region:rollup2
WHAT'S RARE IS SOMEBODY MAKING

01:30:30.025 --> 01:30:32.093 region:rollup2
SOMETHING UP. OUT OF WHOLE

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.761 region:rollup2
CLOTH.

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.361 region:rollup2
NO BUT SOMEBODY TAKING SOMETHING

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:33.862 region:rollup2
OUT OF CONTEXT BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:36.097 region:rollup2
ANGRY WITH SOMEBODY. OR

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:37.666 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATING IT OR COMPLAINING

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.900 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THEY.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:40.835 region:rollup2
DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT AT THE

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:42.470 region:rollup2
TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEAN

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:45.674 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF NUANCES TO

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:46.775 region:rollup2
THEM. AND SO IT'S MORE

01:30:45.674 --> 01:30:48.310 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:50.045 region:rollup2
WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY COMPLAIN

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:52.981 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DO IS THERE A MOTIVE

01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:54.182 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THEY WERE OFFENDED?

01:30:52.981 --> 01:30:56.451 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE FACT THAT THERE MAY

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:58.687 region:rollup2
BE A MOTIVE DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:00.121 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT IT MAY COLOR

01:30:58.687 --> 01:31:04.059 region:rollup2
HOW SERIOUS IT WAS OR HOW OR

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:05.961 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INITIAL REACTION WAS.

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:07.062 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE. THE BEST

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:08.296 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SCIENCE THAT I'VE SEEN

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:10.031 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT SERIOUS

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:11.232 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING. FOR

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:15.603 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ASSAULT.

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:17.339 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS TRUE.

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:18.907 region:rollup2
A VANISHINGLY SMALL PERCENTAGE

01:31:17.339 --> 01:31:19.841 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:21.743 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME AND WE HAVE TO

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:22.644 region:rollup2
CATCH THEM BT SOMETHING LIKE

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:25.046 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE ARE

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:27.382 region:rollup2
TRUE. WITH THAT SAID IT DF PH WE

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:29.451 region:rollup2
SEE A HUGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:31.386 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN IF TRUE WOULD NOT

01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:33.955 region:rollup2
VIOLATE. THE LAW AND I THINK

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:36.191 region:rollup2
THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE I'M

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:38.760 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE VERY FEW AVENUES TO

01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:39.661 region:rollup2
EXPRESS. THINGS THAT ARE GOING

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.062 region:rollup2
WRONG.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:43.031 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:44.466 region:rollup2
AVENUE TO DO IT AND THEY KNOW

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:45.967 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY SAY THE WORDS

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:47.402 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:48.436 region:rollup2
THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

01:31:47.402 --> 01:31:50.038 region:rollup2
AND SO IT IS.

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:51.072 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

01:31:50.038 --> 01:31:53.108 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S EMPLOYERS WE ALL HAVE

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:55.443 region:rollup2
TO BE ALERT TO AND SO IT'S NOT

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:56.878 region:rollup2
WRONG THAT PEOPLE BRING ALL

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:58.847 region:rollup2
KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS FORWARD

01:31:56.878 --> 01:32:00.215 region:rollup2
THAT AREN'T ULTIMATELY

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:01.783 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION.

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:03.651 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT WRONG THAT

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:06.287 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE ARE SERIOUS

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:07.956 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS THAT BY AND LARGE

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:09.391 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TRUE.

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:11.226 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT IS MY LAST

01:32:09.391 --> 01:32:12.394 region:rollup2
QUESTION AT THE COMMENT ON MY I

01:32:11.226 --> 01:32:15.830 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE.

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:17.298 region:rollup2
THIS NOTION OF BECAUSE I THINK

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
IT'S TYPICAL FACTION FACTOR

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:21.803 region:rollup2
FASHION SOMETHING HAPPEN GIVEN

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:24.038 region:rollup2
THE JERK AND WE. ALL RUN TO THE

01:32:21.803 --> 01:32:25.673 region:rollup2
THIS SITE KIND OF OF THE ROOM

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:27.308 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO. HAVE

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:29.010 region:rollup2

WHAT WHAT NO ONE HAS REALLY

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:43.625 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT IN ALL THESE

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:43.992 region:rollup2
HEARINGS WHATEVER WE DO. IS AT

THAT ONE OF YOU SAID THAT I

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:11.873 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING WAS

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:13.174 region:rollup2
THAT THE INVESTIGATION THE

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.943 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR SHOULD NEVER BE

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.543 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATE. TO THE PERSON OR

01:35:14.943 --> 01:35:17.712 region:rollup2
THE BODY THAT THEY'RE

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:18.947 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING IS ANOTHER REALLY

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:21.049 region:rollup2
GOOD WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT

01:35:18.947 --> 01:35:22.850 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT A PERCEPTION OF

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:24.586 region:rollup2
BIAS SO THAT'S ANOTHER LANDS

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:27.055 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN. DECIDE TO USE TO

01:35:24.586 --> 01:35:27.689 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHAT WE SENT OUT FROM

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:29.791 region:rollup2
THAT INVESTIGATION AND WHAT WE

01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:32.160 region:rollup2
DO INTERNALLY. AND THIS IS.

01:35:29.791 --> 01:35:33.628 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE FIRST PANEL SO FAR

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.731 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY MADE A VERY STRONG

01:35:33.628 --> 01:35:39.400 region:rollup2
CASE FOR HAVING AN INTERNAL WAY

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.867 region:rollup2

01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:14.389 region:rollup2
PERSON THE COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:17.024 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT. IT TAKES MUCH

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:18.993 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:20.595 region:rollup2
AND YOU NEED TO BE IN TOUCH WITH

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:22.997 region:rollup2
THEM AND LET THEM KNOW YOU KNOW.

01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:23.898 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHERE IT IS HERE'S WHY IT

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:26.467 region:rollup2
TOOK LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:28.503 region:rollup2
IF PEOPLE ARE MOVED THEN THEY

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:30.204 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE UNDERSTANDING WHY THAT

01:38:28.503 --> 01:38:30.872 region:rollup2
IS AND AND THEY CERTAINLY

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:32.507 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T.

01:38:30.872 --> 01:38:34.041 region:rollup2
I'M KIND OF BASIC SEXUAL

01:38:32.507 --> 01:38:36.811 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT LAW THAT YOU

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:37.712 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE MOVING THE. THE

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:40.014 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

01:38:37.712 --> 01:38:41.783 region:rollup2
IT BE IF YOU HAVE TO MOVE

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:43.584 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY I REALIZE SOMETIMES

01:38:41.783 --> 01:38:44.952 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE IF

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.686 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:48.856 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR BUT.

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:50.158 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN YOU

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:52.660 region:rollup2
WANT TO TRY TO PROTECT THEM.

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:54.162 region:rollup2
I'M I WOULD SAY THE.

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.430 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:56.798 region:rollup2
IS WHEN SOMEBODY I I WOULD JUST

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.698 region:rollup2
WANNA START WITH THE MOMENT THAT

01:38:56.798 --> 01:38:58.933 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY COMES FORWARD WITH AN

01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.901 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION ONE OF THE MOST

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:01.135 region:rollup2
COMMON MISTAKES WE SEE IS THAT

01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:02.503 region:rollup2
THE PERSON RECEIVING THAT

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:05.940 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION WHETHER IT'S AN HR

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:07.575 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL. OR A BOSS OR WHOEVER

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.677 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSES OWN NOW.

01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:11.179 region:rollup2
THAT SINCE IMMEDIATELY THE

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:13.114 region:rollup2
WRONG MESSAGE SO IT JUST IN

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:14.148 region:rollup2
TERMS OF TRAINING TO STOP FOR

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:15.683 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING COMPLAINTS THEY THANK

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:18.352 region:rollup2
YOU I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:20.454 region:rollup2
FORWARD. I'M NOW YOU MAY NEED TO

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:22.056 region:rollup2
PAUSE AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:23.991 region:rollup2
IT IS SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:25.359 region:rollup2
EVEN GOING TO INVESTIGATE AND SO

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:27.028 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SAY.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:28.496 region:rollup2
I NEED TO CONSULT WITH WHOEVER

01:39:27.028 --> 01:39:30.298 region:rollup2
IS MAKING THIS DECISION AND WILL

01:39:28.496 --> 01:39:31.566 region:rollup2
BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU TOMORROW OR

01:39:30.298 --> 01:39:32.099 region:rollup2
BY FRIDAY OR WHENEVER IT IS

01:39:31.566 --> 01:39:33.434 region:rollup2
DEPENDING OBVIOUSLY ON THE

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:35.002 region:rollup2
THING.

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:36.737 region:rollup2
IF THE DECISION IS TO MOVE

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:38.439 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH AN INVESTIGATION

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:39.941 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO TELL.

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.741 region:rollup2
THE PERSON COMPLAINING THAT WE

01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:41.742 region:rollup2
ARE MOVING FORWARD IN

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:44.045 region:rollup2
DESICCATION YOU WILL BE

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:45.880 region:rollup2
CONTACTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR.

01:39:44.045 --> 01:39:46.914 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S OUTSIDE OR INSIDE

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.249 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:50.084 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR SHOULD BE

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:51.319 region:rollup2
CONTACTING THAT PERSON. RIGHT

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.687 region:rollup2
AWAY SO THEN THEY KNOW WHAT'S

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:54.622 region:rollup2
GOING ON IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:39:52.687 --> 01:39:55.790 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AS AMY SAID I

01:39:54.622 --> 01:39:56.791 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S FAIR TO TELL THEM.

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:58.326 region:rollup2
.

01:39:56.791 --> 01:39:59.727 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD FOR A

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.228 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF TIME BECAUSE OF

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:02.396 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S SCHEDULES FOR.

01:40:00.228 --> 01:40:04.398 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:05.733 region:rollup2
I'M IF THEY COME IF THE

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:08.202 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS SUBSTANTIATED.

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:09.904 region:rollup2
WHO REALLY IT SHOULD BE GOING

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:11.405 region:rollup2
IN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FILES AND I

01:40:09.904 --> 01:40:14.675 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHAT RULES?

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:16.077 region:rollup2
WHAT SPECIFIC RULES GOVERN THIS

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.211 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BUT ANYWHERE ELSE I

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:18.679 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT THAT IF AN

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:19.981 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION OF THAT KINDA

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:21.516 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED THAT THERE IS A

01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:23.551 region:rollup2
RECORD OF IT? ON THAT SOMEONE

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:25.019 region:rollup2
WHO'S WORKING WITH THEM IN THE

01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:26.854 region:rollup2
FUTURE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:27.788 region:rollup2
NOW THEY'RE ALWAYS SETTLEMENTS

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.756 region:rollup2
WHERE PART OF THE SETTLEMENT IS

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:30.224 region:rollup2
THE AGREEMENT OUGHT TO FIT

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:32.193 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AND THE RECORD AND

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:34.061 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST KIND OF A. CASE BY

01:40:32.193 --> 01:40:34.595 region:rollup2
CASE SCENARIO AND THAT'S NO

01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:36.030 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HERE THAN IN ANY

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:37.832 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:39.333 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT.

01:40:37.832 --> 01:40:41.369 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THE

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:42.336 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF LEAKING DURING AN

01:40:41.369 --> 01:40:44.005 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND THEN OF COURSE

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:44.772 region:rollup2
IN OUR LINE OF WORK. IT'S IN THE

01:40:44.005 --> 01:40:47.375 region:rollup2
PRESS.

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:49.577 region:rollup2
.

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:51.646 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:53.814 region:rollup2
BREACHES OF PRIVACY BUT WHAT

01:40:51.646 --> 01:40:56.450 region:rollup2
STEPS CAN BE TAKEN. TO MAKE SURE

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:57.852 region:rollup2
THAT ANY REPORTED COMPLAINT ON

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:59.353 region:rollup2
HIS HANDLE SECURELY AND

01:40:57.852 --> 01:41:01.422 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY.

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:02.823 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND IF PEOPLE WITNESSES

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:04.625 region:rollup2
ARE BEING QUESTIONED.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:06.661 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:08.162 region:rollup2
ARE THEY BOUND TO NOT TO DISCUSS

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:11.165 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONING.

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:14.902 region:rollup2
DUE TO LEGAL REASONS YOU KNOW

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:16.504 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THIS EVEN BE DON.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:19.273 region:rollup2
WELL IT DEPENDS I EAN THERE IS.

01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:21.075 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME. LAW THAT.

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:22.543 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE NOT TO

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:25.279 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THINGS UNLESS THEY ARE

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:27.114 region:rollup2
EITHER MANAGEMENT. EMPLOYEE OR

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:28.482 region:rollup2
YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:30.618 region:rollup2
DETERMINING THAT IT WOULD OUT

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:33.654 region:rollup2
THERE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THE

01:41:30.618 --> 01:41:34.789 region:rollup2
GENERAL RULE OF. THUMB THAT

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:36.557 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:41:34.789 --> 01:41:40.061 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:41.429 region:rollup2
AND THAT. AN INVESTIGATION AND A

01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:43.998 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT AS PART OF THAT.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:45.032 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN IN SOME CASES AS

01:41:43.998 --> 01:41:46.634 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NOT TO DISCUSS IT

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:49.070 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CAN ASK ANYBODY IN

01:41:46.634 --> 01:41:50.571 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT NOT TO. THE REALITY

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:53.808 region:rollup2
IS THAT PEOPLE DO.

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:54.375 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS IT IMPACTING THEIR

01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:56.310 region:rollup2
LIVES IN A VERY BIG WAY AND

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:59.614 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:41:56.310 --> 01:42:03.150 region:rollup2
IT'S OFTEN JUST TOO DIFFICULT

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:06.087 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TO NOT TALK AND.

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:08.155 region:rollup2
THEN YOU HAVE TO MANAGE IT I I

01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:10.257 region:rollup2
WISH THAT. THERE WAS A WAY TO

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:11.492 region:rollup2
MANAGE IT. THAT HAD MORE

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:13.060 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY BUT THERE ARE

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:14.161 region:rollup2
PRIVACY RIGHTS AND SO THEN

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:16.230 region:rollup2
YOU'RE OFF AND STUFF KNOWING

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:17.732 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAKE THE

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:20.067 region:rollup2
SITUATION BETTER AND YET HAVING

01:42:17.732 --> 01:42:20.901 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT SOMEBODY'S PRIVACY

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:23.137 region:rollup2
AND NOT REVEALING THAT.

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:25.740 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH IS A REALLY

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:28.009 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT SITUATION TO BE IN.

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:30.211 region:rollup2
MY LAST QUESTION.

01:42:28.009 --> 01:42:32.213 region:rollup2
THE.

01:42:30.211 --> 01:42:35.016 region:rollup2
ISN'T INVESTIGATOR. TOM HOW DO

01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:37.051 region:rollup2
THEY ASSESS THEMSELVES FOR BIAS.

01:42:35.016 --> 01:42:38.919 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE

01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:41.789 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:43.924 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THE ASSESSMENTS.

01:42:41.789 --> 01:42:46.060 region:rollup2
WELL THE FIRST PART OF THE

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:47.962 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:49.764 region:rollup2
AN INSTITUTE TO TRAIN PEOPLE AT

01:42:47.962 --> 01:42:51.532 region:rollup2
THE SENSATION WORKPLACE

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:53.701 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS IS BIAS.

01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:55.403 region:rollup2
AND BIAS.

01:42:53.701 --> 01:42:57.038 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IN TERMS OF PEOPLE MAY

01:42:55.403 --> 01:42:58.572 region:rollup2
HAVE A BIAS AGAINST A CERTAIN

01:42:57.038 --> 01:43:00.341 region:rollup2
GROUP I MEAN WE THINK ABOUT THAT

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:01.375 region:rollup2
KIND OF BIAS BUT WERE ALL

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:03.878 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:05.112 region:rollup2
OPINIONS. I ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY

01:43:03.878 --> 01:43:07.148 region:rollup2
WHAT MY CLIENT THINGS BECAUSE

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:09.116 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SUBCONSCIOUSLY TRYING

01:43:07.148 --> 01:43:10.451 region:rollup2
TO BIAS ME FROM THE BEGINNING SO

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:12.353 region:rollup2
THAT I WILL AGREE WITH THEIR

01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:13.821 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW. AND SO WHAT I'VE

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:15.756 region:rollup2
LEARNED TO DO IS TO SAY I

01:43:13.821 --> 01:43:16.991 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU THINK. I

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:19.093 region:rollup2
MIGHT AGREE WITH IT.

01:43:16.991 --> 01:43:20.561 region:rollup2
BUT IF BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:21.829 region:rollup2
BE HAPPY IF I DON'T AGREE THEY

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:23.998 region:rollup2
DON'T HIRE ME BECAUSE I MIGHT

01:43:21.829 --> 01:43:25.633 region:rollup2
NOT AGREE WITH IT. AND SO I TRY

01:43:23.998 --> 01:43:28.002 region:rollup2
TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE.

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:29.970 region:rollup2
AND THAT FREE IT MAKES ME FEEL

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:31.806 region:rollup2
FREER TO JUST MAKE A FINDING

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:33.774 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT MY

01:43:31.806 --> 01:43:35.242 region:rollup2
CLIENT. THINGS WOULD BE THE

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:36.644 region:rollup2
RIGHT FINDING AND.

01:43:36.644 --> 01:43:38.412 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IT YOU HAVE TO

01:43:37.845 --> 01:43:41.282 region:rollup2
HAVE PEOPLE. CHECK YOUR WORK

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:43.284 region:rollup2
AND.

01:43:41.282 --> 01:43:45.219 region:rollup2
NOT JUST DO THINGS IN A VACUUM I

01:43:43.284 --> 01:43:47.955 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE IN MY OFFICE

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:48.823 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ARE

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:49.990 region:rollup2
READING EVERY REPORTS SO THAT.

01:43:48.823 --> 01:43:51.092 region:rollup2

01:43:53.928 --> 01:43:56.931 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WORK AND YOU CAN'T

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:58.399 region:rollup2
JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT YOU'VE GOT

01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:01.001 region:rollup2
A.

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:01.402 region:rollup2
REASON THINGS OUT AND THAT THAT

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:03.671 region:rollup2
MEANS WELL TRAINED

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:05.005 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS.

01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:06.107 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.441 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT THE CLEAREST.

01:44:06.107 --> 01:44:09.443 region:rollup2
.

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:11.512 region:rollup2
WHO THIS SITUATION AT LEAST A

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:12.379 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION OF BIAS IS IF THE

01:44:11.512 --> 01:44:13.814 region:rollup2
PERSON CONDUCTING THE

01:44:12.379 --> 01:44:15.716 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IS KNOWN TO BE

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:16.751 region:rollup2
FRIENDS? WITH THE PEOPLE

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:19.620 region:rollup2
INVOLVED ONE OF THE OTHER.

01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:21.622 region:rollup2
AND IN MOST WORKPLACES MANY

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.524 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW THAT. I AM

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:24.024 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S AN EASY ONE EFFECTS

01:44:23.524 --> 01:44:25.126 region:rollup2
YOU JUST DON'T LET THEM

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:27.328 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE.

01:44:25.126 --> 01:44:29.930 region:rollup2
THE OEO OFFICE OR WHOEVER IT IS

01:44:27.328 --> 01:44:36.137 region:rollup2
IS JUST REMOVED FROM THAT. CASE.

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:37.705 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:39.473 region:rollup2
APOLOGISTS SECTION A QUESTION I

01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:40.808 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:42.243 region:rollup2
ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:44:40.808 --> 01:44:44.245 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING SOME MORE PEOPLE

01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:46.080 region:rollup2
CAN RELIEVE THEIR PRESSURE OR

01:44:44.245 --> 01:44:47.548 region:rollup2
PRESSURE VALVE OR WHAT NOT. I I

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.349 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL MY EXPERIENCE COMES OUT

01:44:47.548 --> 01:44:49.884 region:rollup2
THE LABOR MOVEMENT BUT THAT'S

01:44:48.349 --> 01:44:50.951 region:rollup2
WHAT I DID FOR TWENTY YEARS AND

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:52.720 region:rollup2
I WAS A MEMBER FOR THIRTY YEARS.

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:55.089 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF OUR WORK PLACES THAT

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.657 region:rollup2
HAD STEWARDS AND THAT WAS LIKE

01:44:55.089 --> 01:44:58.826 region:rollup2
THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE THOSE

01:44:56.657 --> 01:45:01.362 region:rollup2
WERE THE WORK PLACES WE HAD THE

01:44:58.826 --> 01:45:03.597 region:rollup2
FEWEST. COMPLAINTS OR GRIEVANCES

01:45:01.362 --> 01:45:05.766 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE WORKER AT THE MEMBER

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:08.435 region:rollup2
HAD SOMEONE THEY CAN GO TO THE

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:10.337 region:rollup2
STEWARD WAS TRAINED TO SAY IS IT

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:12.406 region:rollup2
A GRIPE OR GRIEVANCE BUT THE FOR

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:13.274 region:rollup2
THE PERSON FOR FELT HEARD WHICH

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:14.842 region:rollup2
IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WANT IS THEY

01:45:13.274 --> 01:45:15.776 region:rollup2
WANT TO FEEL HEARD. I DON'T KNOW

01:45:14.842 --> 01:45:17.178 region:rollup2
HOW WE WOULD CREATE SOMETHING

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:19.547 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT IN THE STRUCTURE THAT

01:45:17.178 --> 01:45:20.915 region:rollup2
WE WORK IN BUT WE REALLY DO HAVE

01:45:19.547 --> 01:45:23.551 region:rollup2
TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE

01:45:20.915 --> 01:45:26.987 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN BLOW OFF A LITTLE

01:45:23.551 --> 01:45:29.223 region:rollup2
STEAM. FEEL SAFE ABOUT IT AND I

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:31.892 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD SAVE US A LOT OF

01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:33.027 region:rollup2
TROUBLE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE.

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:35.196 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY HAPPY

01:45:33.027 --> 01:45:36.230 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE NOT BEEN HARASSED OR

01:45:35.196 --> 01:45:37.565 region:rollup2
ASSAULTED WE'LL HAVE

01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:38.666 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATIONS AT WORK AND I THINK

01:45:37.565 --> 01:45:41.335 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO DO THAT

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:43.204 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT REALLY GET TO A BETTER

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:46.240 region:rollup2
PLACE TO WORK. SAYS ONE THAT OUT

01:45:43.204 --> 01:45:48.475 region:rollup2
THERE YEAH I'M SORRY THE POST

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.544 region:rollup2
OFFICE HAS A VERY GOOD MEDIATION

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:52.746 region:rollup2
PROGRAM PER IO COMPLAINTS CALLED

01:45:50.544 --> 01:45:55.449 region:rollup2
REDRESS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:57.351 region:rollup2
AWHILE AND. AND THERE'S A

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:59.820 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION OF

01:45:57.351 --> 01:46:00.354 region:rollup2
MEDIATORS I THINK SENSATION

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.057 region:rollup2
CONFLICT RESOLUTION AC ARE

01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:03.657 region:rollup2
MAYBE.

01:46:03.057 --> 01:46:10.698 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:11.232 region:rollup2
ABOUT INTERNAL PROGRAMS FOR

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:11.799 region:rollup2
MEDIATING DISPUTES THAT.

01:46:11.232 --> 01:46:12.399 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE A PLACE THAT

01:46:11.799 --> 01:46:13.067 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COULD GO THAT DOESN'T

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:13.634 region:rollup2
FEEL A SERIOUS IS GOING TO HUMAN

01:46:13.067 --> 01:46:14.201 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE GOING TO RULE

01:46:13.634 --> 01:46:14.802 region:rollup2
SWEAR IT REALLY FEELS LIKE

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:15.436 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING THERE TO FILE A

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:17.304 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT. TO A PLACE THAT YOU

01:46:15.436 --> 01:46:19.506 region:rollup2
CAN GO LIKE YOU SAID THAT'S A

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:22.776 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE. KIND OF PEER TO

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:24.478 region:rollup2
PEER IN A WAY I RATHER THAN.

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:26.513 region:rollup2
SOUNDING LIKE YOU'RE THERE TO

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:27.548 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FILE SOMETHING FORMAL.

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:29.183 region:rollup2
.

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:30.117 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTIONS BEFORE I MOVE ON

01:46:29.183 --> 01:46:30.684 region:rollup2
TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE BEEN

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:32.887 region:rollup2
WAITING PATIENTLY. ON ONE IS

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:34.421 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:36.290 region:rollup2
YOU SAID SOMETHING REALLY VERY

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:37.324 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:39.426 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD I POINTING AT BOTH

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:40.461 region:rollup2
OF YOU. ABOUT HOW THERE ARE FEW

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:42.429 region:rollup2
FALSE COMPLAINTS MEANING THAT

01:46:40.461 --> 01:46:44.965 region:rollup2
THERE ARE VERY FEW TIMES PEOPLE

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:46.533 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING UP THE FACTS. BUT

01:46:44.965 --> 01:46:48.669 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES HAPPEN IS THE

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:50.905 region:rollup2
MOTIVATIONS MAYBE SOMEONE UP ON

01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
THAT IS PUTTING ON TO AN EVENT

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:53.374 region:rollup2
IS DIFFERENT THE MOTIVATION

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:54.675 region:rollup2
THERE PUTTING ON TO THE

01:46:53.374 --> 01:46:56.810 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:46:54.675 --> 01:46:58.212 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PERPETRATOR. PERCEIVES

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:58.946 region:rollup2
OR THE REASON WHY THEY WERE

01:46:58.212 --> 01:46:59.780 region:rollup2
DEMOTED IS DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:46:58.946 --> 01:47:01.248 region:rollup2
REASON THEY SUSPECT WHICH IS

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.649 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE COMMON ONE THAT WE

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:04.585 region:rollup2
SEE A LOT OF YOUR.

01:47:01.649 --> 01:47:06.120 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:47:04.585 --> 01:47:08.222 region:rollup2
AND I'M WONDERING IF A GOOD

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.957 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION OPINES ON THAT

01:47:08.222 --> 01:47:10.624 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT THEN IF IF MOST OF

01:47:09.957 --> 01:47:12.293 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FACTS THAT YOU'RE

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:14.762 region:rollup2
GATHERING OR NOT THAT IN DISPUTE

01:47:12.293 --> 01:47:15.996 region:rollup2
EVERYONE SAYS WE WERE THERE AT

01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:18.299 region:rollup2
THIS THIS TIME AND. THIS HAPPEN

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:20.167 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST I MEANT THIS I DIDN'T

01:47:18.299 --> 01:47:22.069 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT. SO DOES THE

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:24.038 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION ALSO LOOK INTO

01:47:22.069 --> 01:47:24.471 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IF NOT THEN HOW IS

01:47:24.038 --> 01:47:27.708 region:rollup2
ANYBODY READING THE

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:29.710 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO HAVE ANY IDEA.

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:31.011 region:rollup2
ABOUT REALLY WHETHER SOMEONE WAS

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:32.947 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SEDUCE OR JUST HAVING

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:37.318 region:rollup2
A DRINK FOR INSTANCE WHICH IS

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:37.751 region:rollup2
OFTEN THE CRUX OF A SEXUAL

01:47:37.318 --> 01:47:38.652 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT. ISSUE.

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:40.254 region:rollup2
SURE I MEAN TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:47:38.652 --> 01:47:41.055 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO

01:47:40.254 --> 01:47:44.224 region:rollup2
FAR.

01:47:41.055 --> 01:47:45.826 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:47.361 region:rollup2
YOU JUST GAVE US A SAMPLE OF A

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:49.129 region:rollup2
DEMOTION LET'S SAY IN.

01:47:47.361 --> 01:47:50.431 region:rollup2
THAT THE INVESTIGATOR MIGHT FIND

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:52.933 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S IT'S MORE REASONABLE

01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:55.936 region:rollup2
TO FIND THAT THE DEMOTION HAPPEN

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:57.838 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF X. Y. AND Z. THEN IT

01:47:55.936 --> 01:48:00.708 region:rollup2
WAS BASED ON GENDER. DUE TO TE

01:47:57.838 --> 01:48:02.343 region:rollup2
FACT THAT NEAR THERE WERE THESE

01:48:00.708 --> 01:48:04.812 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES IN ISSUES IN.

01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:06.313 region:rollup2
AND SO SIMILARLY YEAH I MEAN THE

01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:07.381 region:rollup2
MEANING OF ASKING SOMEBODY FOR A

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:09.149 region:rollup2
DRINK.

01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:10.484 region:rollup2
THEN BASED ON THE CREDIBILITY OF

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:12.319 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SAID YOU'D BE MAKING A

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:14.455 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT IT WAS MORE OR LESS

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:16.724 region:rollup2
CREDIBLE THAT THEY DID OR DIDN'T

01:48:14.455 --> 01:48:18.192 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

01:48:16.724 --> 01:48:20.227 region:rollup2
FROM AN INVESTIGATION SOME POINT

01:48:18.192 --> 01:48:22.496 region:rollup2
I WANT TO KNOW. IF THE

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:23.797 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS UNSUBSTANTIATED

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:26.700 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE IS NONE THE LESS A

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:28.702 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH. BELIEF THAT WIPED

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.137 region:rollup2
THE THE PERSON MAKING THE

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:32.306 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT BELIEVE HAPPENED.

01:48:30.137 --> 01:48:34.508 region:rollup2
WAS TRUE EVEN IF I ACTUALLY IT

01:48:32.306 --> 01:48:36.777 region:rollup2
WASN'T TRUE. I'M BECAUSE IF

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:37.277 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A GOOD FAITH REASON

01:48:36.777 --> 01:48:38.512 region:rollup2
WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:40.047 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED ABOUT THAT ALSO

01:48:38.512 --> 01:48:41.715 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:48:40.047 --> 01:48:44.017 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER. TO TAKE CORRECTIVE

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:45.452 region:rollup2
ACTION EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:48:44.017 --> 01:48:48.188 region:rollup2
ANY WRONG DOING YOU CAN SAY HEY

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:49.356 region:rollup2
I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:52.126 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED IT THIS WAY. ARM AND

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:54.762 region:rollup2
YOU CAN KIND OF INTERVENE IN A

01:48:52.126 --> 01:48:55.863 region:rollup2
NON DISCIPLINARY WAY TO CORRECT.

01:48:54.762 --> 01:48:57.297 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIONS.

01:48:55.863 --> 01:48:58.966 region:rollup2
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION ALSO

01:48:57.297 --> 01:49:00.734 region:rollup2
BASED ON SOMETHING YOU SAID WE

01:48:58.966 --> 01:49:02.069 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION KIND OF.

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:04.438 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY ABOUT.

01:49:02.069 --> 01:49:06.907 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:49:04.438 --> 01:49:08.342 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE DIRECT ON SORT OF

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:08.842 region:rollup2
NOT LEGAL TERM OF MANDATORY

01:49:08.342 --> 01:49:10.144 region:rollup2
REPORTER BUT THAT WE'RE

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:11.278 region:rollup2
EXPECTED.

01:49:10.144 --> 01:49:12.746 region:rollup2
AS MEMBERS FOR INSTANCE OF AN

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:13.981 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE TELLS US ABOUT A

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:16.016 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT WE'RE EXPECTED TO

01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:17.484 region:rollup2
GO AND. MAKE A REPORT ABOUT IT

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:18.585 region:rollup2
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:19.620 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE THERIGHT

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:21.155 region:rollup2
KIND OF RESPONSE WHEN THAT

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.689 region:rollup2
PERSON FIRST MAKES EYE CONTACT

01:49:21.155 --> 01:49:24.191 region:rollup2
WITH YOU. SO ARE THEIR BEST

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:26.460 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OUT THERE THAT WE CAN

01:49:24.191 --> 01:49:28.662 region:rollup2
LOOK AT FOR HOW TO TRAIN OUR

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:31.565 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS AND ARE. UNDER OUR

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:33.667 region:rollup2
TERMS MANDATORY REPORTERS OF HOW

01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:34.668 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND. THE BEST WAY TO

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.437 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE SOMEONE TO COME

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:37.871 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

01:49:36.437 --> 01:49:39.273 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE IN TRAUMA OR MIGHT BE

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.807 region:rollup2
FRIGHTENED YOU KNOW WHERE DO WE

01:49:39.273 --> 01:49:42.776 region:rollup2
LOOK TO TO TO TRAIN THOSE

01:49:39.807 --> 01:49:44.678 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.979 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFTEN PART OF THE AB

01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:47.548 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TRAINING.

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:49.450 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE SEEN IN THAT I'VE

01:49:47.548 --> 01:49:51.752 region:rollup2
DONE IS IS SOMETIMES EVEN ROLE

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:53.087 region:rollup2
PLAYING. AS A SUPERVISOR YOU

01:49:51.752 --> 01:49:54.188 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO INVESTIGATE BUT

01:49:53.087 --> 01:49:55.989 region:rollup2
YOU DO HAVE TO ACCEPT A

01:49:54.188 --> 01:49:57.958 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT SO HERE'S WHAT YOU

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:59.460 region:rollup2

HANDLE IT YOURSELF. HERE'S WHO

YOU'D WALK THIS PERSON TOO SO

01:50:02.863 --> 01:50:06.633 region:rollup2
THAT. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE REALLY

01:50:05.132 --> 01:50:08.268 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO DO THIS

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:10.838 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY DON'T THEY SHOULD

01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:11.939 region:rollup2
GET IT RIGHT AWAY TO THE PERSON

01:50:10.838 --> 01:50:13.674 region:rollup2
WHO DOES INSTEAD OF FUMBLING.

01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:14.808 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TRAININGS THE EOC HAS

01:50:13.674 --> 01:50:16.376 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT VERY RECENTLY A

01:50:14.808 --> 01:50:17.678 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL WORKPLACES TRAINING

LONG. SELECTS TASK FORCE ON.

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:25.319 region:rollup2
PRESSMAN AND THE WORKPLACE.

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:26.620 region:rollup2
WORK AND THIS RESPECTFUL

01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:27.788 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE TRAINING FOCUSES ON

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.223 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED

01:50:27.788 --> 01:50:30.390 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:50:29.223 --> 01:50:32.226 region:rollup2
LEGAL STANDARDS.

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:34.928 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY LIKE WHAT ONE OF

01:50:32.226 --> 01:50:35.529 region:rollup2
THE BEST PRACTICES FROM A TO Z.

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:38.999 region:rollup2
IN DEALING WITH A COMPLAINT.

01:50:35.529 --> 01:50:41.635 region:rollup2
SOME MEMORY AS.

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:43.337 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:46.006 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER THE

01:50:43.337 --> 01:50:47.975 region:rollup2
TO GIVE TO AN EMPLOYEE.

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:50.077 region:rollup2
IF THEY SAY WE DON'T NEED YOU TO

01:50:47.975 --> 01:50:51.378 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE JUST GIVE ME MY

01:50:50.077 --> 01:50:52.846 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO SUE LETTER THEY THEN

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:54.615 region:rollup2
HAVE HOW LONG TO FILE THEIR

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:56.116 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT ONE YEAR.

01:50:54.615 --> 01:50:56.984 region:rollup2
AND HOW OFTEN DOES IT HAPPEN

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:58.151 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COME TO YOU AND THEY

01:50:56.984 --> 01:50:59.353 region:rollup2
SAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:01.288 region:rollup2
ANYTHING I JUST WANT YOU TO GIVE

01:50:59.353 --> 01:51:02.823 region:rollup2
ME. THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER AND

01:51:01.288 --> 01:51:06.827 region:rollup2
A MAJORITY OF CASES.

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:09.096 region:rollup2
AND THE THE THE THE THE.

01:51:06.827 --> 01:51:11.532 region:rollup2
BUDGET THE DFG AGE HAS TO

01:51:09.096 --> 01:51:12.799 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE.

01:51:11.532 --> 01:51:14.401 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE SUFFICIENT OF MOST

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:16.169 region:rollup2
OF THOSE PEOPLE SAID WE WANT YOU

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:18.272 region:rollup2
TO INVESTIGATE NO.

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:21.241 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN ISSUE.

01:51:18.272 --> 01:51:23.143 region:rollup2
DTH OFTENTIMES.

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:25.646 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO REALLY

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:27.915 region:rollup2
DO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS.

01:51:25.646 --> 01:51:30.484 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:51:27.915 --> 01:51:32.352 region:rollup2
IT IS. AS I SAID HERE IT IS MY

01:51:30.484 --> 01:51:33.587 region:rollup2
GOAL THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS ARE

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:34.922 region:rollup2
THOROUGH AND COMPLETE AND THEY

01:51:33.587 --> 01:51:36.523 region:rollup2
MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE

01:51:34.922 --> 01:51:37.491 region:rollup2
YEAR UNLIKE OUR FEDERAL

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.259 region:rollup2
COUNTERPART THE EOC.

01:51:37.491 --> 01:51:40.460 region:rollup2
.

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:41.895 region:rollup2
BUT OUR BUDGET IS BASED ON THE

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.297 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:44.431 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:51:43.297 --> 01:51:46.133 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS THAT WE ISSUE THE

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:47.100 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO SUE FOR SO TO THE

01:51:46.133 --> 01:51:49.436 region:rollup2
EXTENT THOSE CO OP.

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:52.439 region:rollup2
THAT DOES CREATE STOPPING AND

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:53.607 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD PROBLEMS FOR US YES.

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:55.742 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU

01:51:53.607 --> 01:51:57.411 region:rollup2
MADE EARLIER.

01:51:55.742 --> 01:52:01.248 region:rollup2
YOU YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DUE

01:51:57.411 --> 01:52:02.616 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND HOW. WE.

01:52:01.248 --> 01:52:03.684 region:rollup2
FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE WE

01:52:02.616 --> 01:52:05.552 region:rollup2
JUMP TO THE GODDESSES.

01:52:03.684 --> 01:52:08.155 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO PROCESS

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:10.357 region:rollup2
AND YOU SAID DUE PROCESS IS NOT

01:52:08.155 --> 01:52:12.726 region:rollup2
A LEGAL REQUIREMENT.

01:52:10.357 --> 01:52:15.562 region:rollup2
LET ME LET ME CLARIFY. ANY

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:17.164 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THE FAMOUS LINE IS

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:18.165 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY.

01:52:17.164 --> 01:52:19.433 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NOT A COLLECTIVE

01:52:18.165 --> 01:52:21.568 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENT RIGHT A

01:52:19.433 --> 01:52:22.903 region:rollup2
UNION CONTRACT. THE FAMOUS LINE

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:24.304 region:rollup2
IS AN EMPLOYER IS ALLOWED TO

01:52:22.903 --> 01:52:25.973 region:rollup2
MAKE A GOOD DECISION A BAD

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:27.074 region:rollup2
DECISION OR IS ALLOWED TO HAVE A

01:52:25.973 --> 01:52:28.709 region:rollup2
GOOD REASON ABOUT REASON OR NO

01:52:27.074 --> 01:52:31.445 region:rollup2
REASON AT ALL FOR TAKING ACTION

01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:31.845 region:rollup2
AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. SO LONG AS

01:52:31.445 --> 01:52:33.080 region:rollup2
THE REASON IS NOT

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:34.448 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.916 region:rollup2
IN PRACTICE I DON'T REALLY THINK

01:52:34.448 --> 01:52:37.317 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT IF YOU

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:38.852 region:rollup2
HAVE LITERALLY NO REASON FOR

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:40.487 region:rollup2
DEMOTING AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:41.822 region:rollup2
GONNA GET A COMPLAINT AND SOME

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:44.224 region:rollup2
FINDER OF FACT IS GOING TO

01:52:41.822 --> 01:52:45.192 region:rollup2
WONDER WHY YOU DID THAT. BUT THE

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:48.395 region:rollup2
REALITY IS.

01:52:45.192 --> 01:52:50.664 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER IS ALLOWED TO TAKE

01:52:48.395 --> 01:52:53.133 region:rollup2
ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYEES WITHOUT

01:52:50.664 --> 01:52:56.536 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF PROCESS. WHETHER OR

01:52:53.133 --> 01:52:57.037 region:rollup2
NOT IT IS WISE TO DO SO. IT IS

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.438 region:rollup2
NOT A COURT PROCEEDING.

01:52:57.037 --> 01:53:00.407 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:02.109 region:rollup2
AN AN ALLEGATION OF WRONGDOING

01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:02.676 region:rollup2
IN A WORKPLACE THERE ARE

01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:03.844 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS OUT THERE WHO ARE

01:53:02.676 --> 01:53:05.479 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:53:03.844 --> 01:53:06.813 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION YOU'RE OUT.

01:53:05.479 --> 01:53:07.714 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WISE I

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:09.516 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD

01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:12.185 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE BUT IT'S NOT

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:14.121 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:17.190 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO BE ALERT TO THE FACT

01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:20.027 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU CREATE A SYSTEM. OF.

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:21.395 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS. WHATEVER THAT

01:53:20.027 --> 01:53:23.363 region:rollup2
MEANS FOR THE INSTITUTION. THAT

01:53:21.395 --> 01:53:25.365 region:rollup2
IS NOT.

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:26.833 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES IT MIGHT

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.734 region:rollup2
BE A BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDED

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:30.337 region:rollup2
PRACTICE?

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:31.571 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SOMEONE CAN

01:53:30.337 --> 01:53:35.475 region:rollup2
THEN COME AND SAY.

01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:38.712 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T GET TO.

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:40.047 region:rollup2
CONFRONTED MY ACCUSER PUBLICLY.

01:53:38.712 --> 01:53:42.416 region:rollup2
WELL YOU DON'T GET TO CONFRONT

01:53:40.047 --> 01:53:43.083 region:rollup2
YOUR CONFUSED ACCUSER PUBLICLY

01:53:42.416 --> 01:53:46.019 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT

01:53:43.083 --> 01:53:49.289 region:rollup2
IT IS. SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR.

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:50.290 region:rollup2
UNLESS THERE IS DISCRIMINATION.

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:52.192 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE ONE

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:54.094 region:rollup2
OF THE ALLEGATIONS THEN YOU ARE

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:56.530 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS OR

01:53:54.094 --> 01:53:58.932 region:rollup2
UNLESS THERE IS RETALIATION.

01:53:56.530 --> 01:54:00.267 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:53:58.932 --> 01:54:02.102 region:rollup2
NO IF YOU'RE ACCUSED OF

01:54:00.267 --> 01:54:04.137 region:rollup2
WRONGDOING THERE IS NOTHING THAT

01:54:02.102 --> 01:54:05.672 region:rollup2
THE LAW SAYS THAT YOU ARE

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:07.341 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO IN A WORKPLACE.

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:08.675 region:rollup2
UNLESS THERE'S A UNION CONTRACT

01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:10.077 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES YOU CERTAIN.

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:11.278 region:rollup2
GRIEVANCE RIGHTS OR WHATEVER BUT

01:54:10.077 --> 01:54:12.446 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING

01:54:11.278 --> 01:54:14.214 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER CAN MAKE A DECISION

01:54:12.446 --> 01:54:15.349 region:rollup2
BASED ON ANYTHING THE EMPLOYER

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:17.884 region:rollup2
WANTS TO DO.

01:54:15.349 --> 01:54:19.119 region:rollup2
NOW YOU MIGHT THEN FILE A

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:20.554 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT AGAINST YOUR EMPLOYER

01:54:19.119 --> 01:54:21.755 region:rollup2
WHO HASN'T GONE THROUGH CERTAIN

01:54:20.554 --> 01:54:24.124 region:rollup2
STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:54:21.755 --> 01:54:24.925 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION IS WELL FOUNDED BUT

01:54:24.124 --> 01:54:27.394 region:rollup2
NO YOU HAVE NO.

01:54:24.925 --> 01:54:30.263 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT RIGHT TO ANY PROCESS.

01:54:27.394 --> 01:54:31.498 region:rollup2
UNLESS THE JOB WAS A RIGHT AS

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:33.066 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO PRIVILEGE IF YOU'RE

01:54:31.498 --> 01:54:34.735 region:rollup2
NOT WILLING CHLOE WHAT YOU'RE

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:35.969 region:rollup2
SAYING IS TRUE DIRECT AND

01:54:34.735 --> 01:54:37.270 region:rollup2
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHEN IT

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.904 region:rollup2
BECOMES A RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:41.041 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE.

01:54:37.904 --> 01:54:42.943 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:44.778 region:rollup2
I'M JOB ITSELF YOU CAN'T TAKE A

01:54:42.943 --> 01:54:45.278 region:rollup2
RIDE AWAY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL

01:54:44.778 --> 01:54:47.247 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU GIVE THEM DUE

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:49.116 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:50.317 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT A JOB LIKE AN OUT WILL

01:54:49.116 --> 01:54:51.251 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT

01:54:50.317 --> 01:54:52.753 region:rollup2
TO THAT SHOP JUST GENERALLY

01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:54.521 region:rollup2
SPEAKING YOU CAN'T TAKE A RIGHT

01:54:52.753 --> 01:54:56.189 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM SOMEONE UNLESS YOU

01:54:54.521 --> 01:54:57.524 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS. SO THE

01:54:56.189 --> 01:55:00.527 region:rollup2
QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHETHER IT

01:54:57.524 --> 01:55:02.329 region:rollup2
WAS A RIGHT TO HAVE A JOB OR

01:55:00.527 --> 01:55:03.864 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THAT JOB.

01:55:02.329 --> 01:55:05.298 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IS ONE WAY OF

01:55:03.864 --> 01:55:07.200 region:rollup2
FRAMING IT YES BUT I'M NOT AWARE

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:09.002 region:rollup2
OF A JOB THAT IS A RIGHT AND

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.604 region:rollup2
THEN I WILL HAVE A CONTRACT.

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:11.938 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY YOU DOUBT BUT WELL A

01:55:10.604 --> 01:55:12.939 region:rollup2
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT YEAH YOU

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:14.241 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW WHATEVER

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ARE IN THE CONTRACT

01:55:14.241 --> 01:55:17.210 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THE COLLECTIVE

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.744 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS RIGHT.

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:20.647 region:rollup2
AFTER. ABSENT AN AGREEMENT

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:21.948 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:22.516 region:rollup2
NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS

01:55:36.463 --> 01:55:40.434 region:rollup2
WELL AN INVESTIGATION IS GOING

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:43.603 region:rollup2

COMPLAINT?

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:47.908 region:rollup2
FOR A DETERMINATION TO BE MADE

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.610 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COMPLAINT NEEDS TO BE

01:55:47.908 --> 01:55:53.280 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED AS I SAID I USUALLY

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:55.415 region:rollup2
ADVISE. IF IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.716 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES AND YOU

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:58.018 region:rollup2

YOU INVESTIGATE.

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:02.956 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMES

01:56:00.821 --> 01:56:05.325 region:rollup2
WITH A NON SERIOUS.

01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:07.327 region:rollup2

SAID I PERCEIVE THAT TO BE

01:56:12.299 --> 01:56:15.802 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:56:13.834 --> 01:56:17.537 region:rollup2
FROM MY EXPERIENCE MORE AND MORE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:20.040 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:22.442 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING THOSE COMPLAINTS.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.077 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE IS A COST THERE'S

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:25.045 region:rollup2
OF AS YOU KNOW IT WAS POINTED

01:56:24.077 --> 01:56:26.379 region:rollup2
OUT THERE'S A COST TO THE

01:56:25.045 --> 01:56:28.648 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER AND THERE'S A COST TO

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:31.084 region:rollup2

OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:33.587 region:rollup2
LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY AT CETERA.

01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.822 region:rollup2
AND.

01:56:33.587 --> 01:56:38.225 region:rollup2
.

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:39.559 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:56:38.225 --> 01:56:41.661 region:rollup2
A POINT WHERE WE'RE

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:43.663 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING EVERYTHING. EVEN

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:44.898 region:rollup2
WHEN IT IS AT SUCH A LOW LEVEL

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:46.933 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A SERIOUS

01:56:44.898 --> 01:56:48.668 region:rollup2
VIOLATION AND ISN'T THERE MIGHT

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:50.370 region:rollup2
THERE NOT BE ANOTHER WAY OF

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:51.771 region:rollup2
HANDLING IT THAT WOULD BE.

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:52.772 region:rollup2
I AM A MORE POSITIVE WAY OF

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:55.075 region:rollup2
HANDLING THAT PARTICULAR

01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:55.642 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A

01:56:55.075 --> 01:56:57.244 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LEVEL YOU HAVE TO DO

01:56:55.642 --> 01:56:58.845 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:56:57.244 --> 01:57:00.947 region:rollup2
AND CLEARLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:03.016 region:rollup2
THAT WAY TO HANDLE THOSE

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:05.886 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

01:57:03.016 --> 01:57:07.754 region:rollup2
THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCE.

01:57:05.886 --> 01:57:09.923 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THEM?

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:11.591 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE LOOKING TO DETERMINE

01:57:09.923 --> 01:57:13.493 region:rollup2
WHICH OF THE CASES ARE

01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:16.563 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:18.398 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE A STANDARD.

01:57:16.563 --> 01:57:20.734 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THAT YOU WOULD LOOK

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:22.969 region:rollup2
TO LET'S SAY THAT IS THE. THE

01:57:20.734 --> 01:57:24.938 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION IS HE SAID I LOOK

01:57:22.969 --> 01:57:26.006 region:rollup2
LOVELY TODAY.

01:57:24.938 --> 01:57:28.208 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A

01:57:26.006 --> 01:57:30.243 region:rollup2
SERIOUS VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES

01:57:28.208 --> 01:57:31.778 region:rollup2
IF THE ANSWER IS NO AND WOULD

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:33.213 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD YOU TAKE DISCIPLINARY

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:34.648 region:rollup2
ACTION AGAINST SOMEBODY FOR

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:35.615 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT.

01:57:34.648 --> 01:57:37.617 region:rollup2
AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DO

01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:39.052 region:rollup2
AN INTAKE WAS DID IT HAPPEN MORE

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:40.387 region:rollup2
THAN ONCE WAS THERE ANY

01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:42.255 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR REASON YOU FOUND THAT

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:43.657 region:rollup2
SO OFFENSIVE BUT. IF THAT'S

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:46.059 region:rollup2
REALLY IT.

01:57:43.657 --> 01:57:47.627 region:rollup2
THEN. THAT CASE MIGHT BE ONE

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:49.262 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU SAY. THAT WOULD

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:51.498 region:rollup2
VIOLATE OUR RULES BUT I CAN TELL

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:53.199 region:rollup2
YOU WERE OFFENDED CAN WE GET YOU

01:57:51.498 --> 01:57:54.801 region:rollup2
TO TALK TO GATHER TALK ABOUT

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:56.369 region:rollup2
THAT CAN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND

01:57:54.801 --> 01:57:57.370 region:rollup2
HOW TO WORK TOGETHER BETTER SO

01:57:56.369 --> 01:57:59.472 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT STEPPING ON EACH

01:57:57.370 --> 01:58:01.141 region:rollup2
OTHER'S TOES BUT. THIS IS NOT

01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:03.176 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WOULD GO INTO THE. WE

01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:05.145 region:rollup2
NEED TO INVESTIGATE AND TAKE

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:06.713 region:rollup2
ACTION BASKET.

01:58:05.145 --> 01:58:08.448 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT BECAUSE. WE'VE

01:58:06.713 --> 01:58:10.617 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE ZERO TOLERANCE

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:13.053 region:rollup2
BEFORE. AND EVEN WITH ZERO

01:58:10.617 --> 01:58:17.324 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE.

01:58:13.053 --> 01:58:19.459 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION NOW.

01:58:17.324 --> 01:58:21.328 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN MADE

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:23.830 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOW NEED THAT WE NEED A

01:58:21.328 --> 01:58:26.399 region:rollup2
CULTURE CHANGE. IT HERE THERE

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:27.033 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WORK

01:58:26.399 --> 01:58:28.535 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT NEEDS A CULTURE

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:30.937 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

01:58:28.535 --> 01:58:32.472 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CULTURE CHANGE NEEDED

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:34.541 region:rollup2
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES.

01:58:32.472 --> 01:58:37.277 region:rollup2
IN THIS CULTURE CHANGE.

01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:38.778 region:rollup2
IS THERE THE THE DANGER OF.

01:58:37.277 --> 01:58:43.316 region:rollup2
LETTING THE PENDULUM SWING TOO

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:45.352 region:rollup2
FAR TO THE OPPOSITE END.

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:46.519 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK THERE'S. I I

01:58:45.352 --> 01:58:48.788 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:49.356 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOUR CONCERN

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:51.358 region:rollup2
IS I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A

01:58:49.356 --> 01:58:52.926 region:rollup2
DANGER AS I SAID IN.

01:58:51.358 --> 01:58:54.661 region:rollup2
.

01:58:52.926 --> 01:58:56.630 region:rollup2
BEING TOO HARSH

01:58:54.661 --> 01:58:57.931 region:rollup2
WITH PEOPLE.

01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:59.165 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK GETTING EVERY

01:58:57.931 --> 01:59:02.602 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT RIGHT BUT I DON'T

01:58:59.165 --> 01:59:05.038 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A DANGER IN.

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:06.940 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A WORKPLACE THAT HAS

01:59:05.038 --> 01:59:09.075 region:rollup2
RESPECT AS IT'S YOU KNOW UP

01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:10.910 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE IN EVERY SITUATION

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:13.580 region:rollup2
AND THAT PEOPLE ARE. ALWAYS

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:16.549 region:rollup2
GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT END AND

01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:17.150 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT IS HOW THEY THINK

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.418 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATING EACH

01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:20.620 region:rollup2
OTHER SO.

01:59:18.418 --> 01:59:23.089 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DISRESPECT.

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:24.024 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND MEANING THAT PEOPLE

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:26.226 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:27.694 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T THINK THAT SWINGING

01:59:26.226 --> 01:59:29.229 region:rollup2
TOO FAR BUT IT'S ZERO TOLERANCE

01:59:27.694 --> 01:59:30.130 region:rollup2
MEANS.

01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:31.831 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID WAS A

01:59:30.130 --> 01:59:33.066 region:rollup2
MICROGRAPHS YOU SHOULD BE FIRED

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:35.969 region:rollup2
FOR IT THEN YEAH THAT WOULD BE

01:59:33.066 --> 01:59:37.837 region:rollup2
SWINGING TOO FAR.

01:59:35.969 --> 01:59:40.340 region:rollup2
IN MY LAST QUESTION IS.

01:59:37.837 --> 01:59:42.542 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HIRE AN OUTSIDE FIRM TO

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:44.911 region:rollup2
DO THE INVESTIGATION WE TALK

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:46.846 region:rollup2

WHATEVER ENTITY IS HIRING THAT

01:59:54.521 --> 01:59:57.123 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE VICTIM WHO'S

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:59.726 region:rollup2
WHO IS.

01:59:57.123 --> 02:00:02.028 region:rollup2

TO DO THAT THEY CAN OPEN THE

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:23.750 region:rollup2
DOORS AND SAY HERE ARE FILES

HAS ANYONE FILED A HARASSMENT.

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:56.149 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT ON A. LEGISLATOR WITH

02:00:53.446 --> 02:01:03.289 region:rollup2
YOUR DEPARTMENT.

02:00:56.149 --> 02:01:08.862 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN OUT WHAT TIME FRAME.

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:10.263 region:rollup2

WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

02:01:10.263 --> 02:01:13.333 region:rollup2
HAPPENED QUITE A BIT TO BY THE

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:14.467 region:rollup2
WAY YOU'RE ANSWERING IT SO IT'S

02:01:13.333 --> 02:01:15.635 region:rollup2
LIKE WAS IT LAST WEEK WHEN I

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:17.203 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GIVE

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:18.538 region:rollup2
THE WRONG IMPRESSION I'M AWARE

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:21.441 region:rollup2
OF ONE RIGHT TO SUE.

02:01:18.538 --> 02:01:22.175 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THAT WAS FILED BUT

02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:23.610 region:rollup2
I'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN

02:01:22.175 --> 02:01:25.578 region:rollup2
REPORTED IN THE PRESS AND I

02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:26.980 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT

REPORTERS HAVE BEEN ASKING AND

02:01:28.314 --> 02:01:32.318 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:34.621 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:36.689 region:rollup2
SLASHING NINE FOR MANY PERIODS.

02:01:34.621 --> 02:01:37.323 region:rollup2
WHICH LET ME JUST CLARIFY I

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:40.093 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD FIND

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:41.494 region:rollup2

02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:10.183 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SAY.

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:11.618 region:rollup2

I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:32.672 region:rollup2
SINCE WE SINCE THE CENTER

02:03:30.837 --> 02:03:34.374 region:rollup2
MAJORITY MENTION THE NINETY TEN

02:03:32.672 --> 02:03:34.941 region:rollup2
RULE I'M KIND OF USED TO THAT

02:03:34.374 --> 02:03:37.043 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWENTY RULE.

02:03:34.941 --> 02:03:39.245 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEM.

02:03:37.043 --> 02:03:41.147 region:rollup2
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:42.849 region:rollup2
THAT ARE. MAYBE BULLIES IN HIGH

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.983 region:rollup2
SCHOOL AND JUST THE OTHER IN THE

02:03:42.849 --> 02:03:45.251 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND.

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:48.421 region:rollup2
CONFRONTED AND THEY JUST KEEP

02:03:46.853 --> 02:03:50.023 region:rollup2
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

02:03:48.421 --> 02:03:51.291 region:rollup2
AND THEN HERE WE ARE ALL OF A

02:03:50.023 --> 02:03:53.026 region:rollup2
SUDDEN SOMEONE FINALLY FILES A

02:03:51.291 --> 02:03:54.661 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT LIKE. ARGUMENTS AND

02:03:53.026 --> 02:03:56.963 region:rollup2
HARVEY WEINSTEIN AT ALL SAID IT

02:03:54.661 --> 02:03:59.032 region:rollup2

TALKING ABOUT.

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:02.969 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH SOMEONE'S MONEY

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:05.204 region:rollup2
STARS KIND OF CURIOUS IS ONE

02:04:02.969 --> 02:04:06.539 region:rollup2
ESERVER.

02:04:05.204 --> 02:04:08.341 region:rollup2
IS IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:08.941 region:rollup2
STARTS AT AN EARLY AGE IN AND

02:04:08.341 --> 02:04:11.010 region:rollup2
DEMAND TO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:12.945 region:rollup2
IT.

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:15.248 region:rollup2
WELL I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO

02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:16.182 region:rollup2
ARE PERPETRATING VERY SERIOUS

02:04:15.248 --> 02:04:19.919 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:22.055 region:rollup2
THAT. IT IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:23.790 region:rollup2
SOME PERSONALITIES THAT YOU KNOW

02:04:22.055 --> 02:04:25.825 region:rollup2
SOME FOR SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS

02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:27.126 region:rollup2
WHO HAS A LOT OF POWER AND THE

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:28.661 region:rollup2
FACT IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:30.997 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF POWER WHO. DO HAVE

02:04:28.661 --> 02:04:32.699 region:rollup2
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS IT'S THEY

02:04:30.997 --> 02:04:34.567 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY. AND THEY'RE

02:04:32.699 --> 02:04:37.370 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE.

02:04:34.567 --> 02:04:38.738 region:rollup2
I MEAN YET I THINK THAT WE ALSO

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:41.674 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:04:38.738 --> 02:04:44.577 region:rollup2
LESS SERIOUS WE TEACH. GENDER

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:45.478 region:rollup2
ROLES. FROM A VERY EARLY AGE IN

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:47.513 region:rollup2
A WAY THAT.

02:04:45.478 --> 02:04:48.047 region:rollup2
OFTEN TEACHES PEOPLE TO CROSS

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:50.650 region:rollup2
LINES AND SO SURE I MEAN I

02:04:48.047 --> 02:04:52.552 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:55.455 region:rollup2
EDUCATION NOT I WOULD TAKE IT

02:04:52.552 --> 02:04:57.490 region:rollup2
EVEN EARLIER. I MEAN I. I

02:04:55.455 --> 02:04:58.424 region:rollup2
REMEMBER BEING AT MY SCHOOLS BY

02:04:57.490 --> 02:04:59.759 region:rollup2
AND KIDS SCHOOLING HEARING

02:04:58.424 --> 02:05:02.161 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PUTTING EACH OTHER DOWN

02:04:59.759 --> 02:05:03.529 region:rollup2
BY SAYING YOU'RE GAY YOU*.

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:04.831 region:rollup2
AND EVERY TIME I WOULD STEP IN

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:07.800 region:rollup2
AND THEY WOULD SAY MOM YOU HAVE

02:05:04.831 --> 02:05:08.735 region:rollup2
TO STEP IN EVERY TIME YOU HEAR

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:12.205 region:rollup2
THIS ON.

02:05:08.735 --> 02:05:14.807 region:rollup2
YEAH SORRY I DO AND I'M.

02:05:12.205 --> 02:05:17.677 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ENDEMIC AND.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:18.811 region:rollup2
I WOULD I'D LOVE TO SEE. THAT

02:05:17.677 --> 02:05:20.079 region:rollup2
CHANGE I THINK THAT COULD MAKE A

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:21.047 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE.

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:22.949 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WHEN YOU DO AN

02:05:21.047 --> 02:05:25.017 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION DO YOU ALSO DO A

02:05:22.949 --> 02:05:26.586 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW NO NOT

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:27.787 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED TO DO THAT I MEAN IT'S

02:05:26.586 --> 02:05:29.856 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER BUT I

02:05:27.787 --> 02:05:32.792 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO

02:05:29.856 --> 02:05:33.426 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSE.

02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:35.795 region:rollup2
WELL THEN WOULD YOU SUBCONTRACT

02:05:33.426 --> 02:05:36.429 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:05:35.795 --> 02:05:38.131 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR

02:05:36.429 --> 02:05:40.033 region:rollup2
PLACE I THINK THAT WE'RE FACT

02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:41.734 region:rollup2
FINDERS AND REGARDLESS OF THE

02:05:40.033 --> 02:05:43.302 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGY OF IT YOU KNOW THAT

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:45.004 region:rollup2
THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS AND.

02:05:43.302 --> 02:05:46.139 region:rollup2
.

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:47.807 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER IN

02:05:46.139 --> 02:05:49.709 region:rollup2
NOTICE BUT I I THINK THAT'S

02:05:47.807 --> 02:05:51.611 region:rollup2
OVERSTEPPING.

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:53.446 region:rollup2
WELL I COME FROM UP THE COUNTING

02:05:51.611 --> 02:05:54.414 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND AND SO.

02:05:53.446 --> 02:05:55.748 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK FOR FRAUD WHEN YOU'RE

DOING AUDITS.

02:05:55.748 --> 02:06:00.753 region:rollup2
AND SO SO OFTEN.

02:05:58.618 --> 02:06:01.521 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WILL BE DISCOVERED AND

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:03.122 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE

02:06:01.521 --> 02:06:06.793 region:rollup2
PERSON AND THEY'LL SAY WELL YOU

QUIET.

02:06:12.065 --> 02:06:14.700 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY GO TO ANOTHER

02:06:12.632 --> 02:06:16.302 region:rollup2
PLAYER AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.937 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SENDING MONEY TO THE OLD

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:20.940 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BUT IT'S COMING OUT OF

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:23.109 region:rollup2
THE POCKET OF. THE NEW EMPLOYER

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:24.277 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION BEFORE AND I'M.

02:06:28.481 --> 02:06:32.952 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:34.954 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF MAYBE WE'RE MISSING

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:36.489 region:rollup2
A COMPONENT IN IN IN OUR

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:38.324 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION SO I I JUST BRING

02:06:36.489 --> 02:06:39.425 region:rollup2
THAT UP SO. THANK YOU MADAM

02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:40.960 region:rollup2
CHAIR.

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:42.161 region:rollup2
BY ME MADAM CHAIR DIDN'T DO THAT

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:43.663 region:rollup2
SENATOR MORE LOCKED AND I AGREE

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:44.897 region:rollup2
WITH YOU I WOULD JUST ADD ONE

02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:46.099 region:rollup2
COMPONENT TO YOUR ARGUMENT THAT

02:06:44.897 --> 02:06:47.600 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE CAN'T START IN HIGH

02:06:46.099 --> 02:06:49.502 region:rollup2
SCHOOL COMING FROM EARLY CARE

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.037 region:rollup2
AND EDUCATION BACKGROUND.

02:06:49.502 --> 02:06:52.472 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THE FAMOUS BESTSELLER

02:06:51.037 --> 02:06:54.273 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW I

02:06:52.472 --> 02:06:55.708 region:rollup2
LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN I THINK

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:56.976 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO START MUCH EARLIER

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:59.178 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THE KIND OF

02:06:56.976 --> 02:07:00.480 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BULLYING BEHAVIOR

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:01.814 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FALLS

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.251 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PARADIGM OF BULLYING

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:05.718 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ALMOND

02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:07.386 region:rollup2
AND.

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:09.021 region:rollup2
AS WE HEARD EARLIER NEEDING TO

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:10.723 region:rollup2
FIND THE BALANCE IN TERMS OF OF

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:12.859 region:rollup2
THE LACK ELECTRIC HAVING THE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:13.059 region:rollup2
POWER TO DECIDE WHO REPRESENTS

02:07:12.859 --> 02:07:13.826 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:07:13.059 --> 02:07:16.529 region:rollup2
.

02:07:13.826 --> 02:07:18.698 region:rollup2
.

02:07:16.529 --> 02:07:20.233 region:rollup2
EIGHT BE THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T

02:07:18.698 --> 02:07:22.635 region:rollup2
LEGISLATE MORALITY.

02:07:20.233 --> 02:07:24.103 region:rollup2
.

02:07:22.635 --> 02:07:26.672 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:29.108 region:rollup2
CREATE A SYSTEM AND A CULTURE

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:31.077 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT EVER. CHARACTERISTIC

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:33.412 region:rollup2
YOU BRING TO THE WORK SPACE

02:07:31.077 --> 02:07:35.615 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THAT MAY BE THEY CAN'T

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:37.383 region:rollup2
DO PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING WE

02:07:35.615 --> 02:07:40.019 region:rollup2
CAN'T REQUIRE PSYCHOLOGICAL

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:40.653 region:rollup2
TESTING OUR ACCU TESTING BEFORE

02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:41.154 region:rollup2
YOU GET A NAME YOUR NAME ON THE

02:07:40.653 --> 02:07:43.022 region:rollup2
BALLOT.

02:07:41.154 --> 02:07:44.690 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO IS CREATE A

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:46.692 region:rollup2
CULTURE IN WHICH?

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:48.160 region:rollup2
WHAT EVER YOU BRING TO THE SPACE

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:48.895 region:rollup2
YOU UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.429 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS THAT WON'T BE

02:07:48.895 --> 02:07:53.099 region:rollup2
TOLERATED? AND I THINK THE

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:54.534 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE IS SOME OF THE

02:07:53.099 --> 02:07:55.501 region:rollup2
BULLYING CHARACTERS BECAUSE

02:07:54.534 --> 02:07:56.969 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:58.704 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO

02:07:56.969 --> 02:08:00.706 region:rollup2
POSITIONS OF POWER SO THEY CAN

02:07:58.704 --> 02:08:02.508 region:rollup2
BULLY.

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:05.545 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:07.680 region:rollup2
SETTING IN WHICH WE ARE IN WHICH

02:08:05.545 --> 02:08:09.882 region:rollup2
IS ALL THE MORE REASON TO CREATE

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.451 region:rollup2
A CULTURE. IN WHICH THE

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:15.087 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION SAYS DON'T CROSS

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:16.956 region:rollup2

BRING TO THEIR DISTRICT HOWEVER

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:25.097 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN BE A PART THIS

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:26.566 region:rollup2

THE PUBLIC AND EMPLOYEES BUT I

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:35.007 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN'T START THE

02:08:32.572 --> 02:08:36.976 region:rollup2
MESSAGING AROUND BULLYING. AND

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:38.444 region:rollup2
GENDER APPROPRIATE INTERACTION

02:08:36.976 --> 02:08:40.913 region:rollup2
TO BEHAVE YOU CAN START EARLY

02:08:38.444 --> 02:08:43.482 region:rollup2
ENOUGH. WE SEE AS THE EARLY CAN

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:45.985 region:rollup2

RADIO SAID THAT REALLY GOT ME

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:46.245 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THE PENDULUM

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:47.513 region:rollup2
SWING TOO FAR AND I'VE HEARD

02:09:46.245 --> 02:09:48.914 region:rollup2
THIS A LOT SORT OF IN THE.

02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:50.650 region:rollup2
POPULAR CULTURE IN THE MEDIA

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:51.284 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THIS YOU KNOW WE

02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:53.419 region:rollup2
DON'T THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO

02:09:51.284 --> 02:09:55.021 region:rollup2
FAR. BUT IT IT'S REALLY A GOOD

02:09:53.419 --> 02:09:56.622 region:rollup2
REMINDER AND WE TALKED ABOUT

02:09:55.021 --> 02:09:59.592 region:rollup2
THIS WHEN WE HAD OUR. CULTURE

02:09:56.622 --> 02:10:00.226 region:rollup2
CHANGE PANEL THAT IF YOU'RE

02:09:59.592 --> 02:10:01.927 region:rollup2
PENDULUM IS A PENDULUM BETWEEN.

02:10:00.226 --> 02:10:03.562 region:rollup2
LOTS OF PUNISHMENT RULES AND A

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:04.897 region:rollup2
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY YOU'RE

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:06.565 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THAT

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:08.301 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT IF YOU'RE PENDULUM

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:09.802 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON. IS ON

02:10:08.301 --> 02:10:11.370 region:rollup2
THE ONE HAND A WORKPLACE WHERE

02:10:09.802 --> 02:10:13.606 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE RESPECTED AND FEEL

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:14.407 region:rollup2
SAFE AND EMPLOYEES FEEL

02:10:13.606 --> 02:10:16.942 region:rollup2
EMPOWERED TO COME FORWARD IF

02:10:14.407 --> 02:10:18.244 region:rollup2
THEY'RE. BEING TREATED BADLY AND

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:19.545 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE PLACE IT

02:10:18.244 --> 02:10:20.913 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DO THAT THEN YOU'RE

02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:21.914 region:rollup2
PENDULUM CANCELING TOO FAR

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:24.050 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:26.085 region:rollup2
PENDULUM TO BE AS FAR AS YOU CAN

02:10:24.050 --> 02:10:28.854 region:rollup2
ON THE SIDE OF. A WORKPLACE THAT

02:10:26.085 --> 02:10:30.589 region:rollup2
RESPECTS EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:33.259 region:rollup2
SO MORE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR.

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:33.893 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE TREATED AS A HUMAN

02:10:33.259 --> 02:10:36.028 region:rollup2
BEING AND SOMEONE WHO'S

02:10:33.893 --> 02:10:38.998 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE SO IF WE THINK ABOUT

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:40.766 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT I THINK THAT HELPS TO

02:10:38.998 --> 02:10:42.768 region:rollup2
KEEP US CLARIFIED ABOUT WHAT OUR

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:45.938 region:rollup2
GOAL REALLY IS HERE IT'S NOT TO

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:47.306 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE PUNISHMENT MORE RULES

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:48.074 region:rollup2
A MORE TOXIC PLACE TO COME TO

02:10:47.306 --> 02:10:48.841 region:rollup2
WORK AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:10:48.074 --> 02:10:50.743 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT NEED SOME OF

02:10:48.841 --> 02:10:52.378 region:rollup2
THAT ALONG THE WAY AND WE NEED.

02:10:50.743 --> 02:10:54.213 region:rollup2
THAT ACCOUNTABILITY OUR GOAL IS

02:10:52.378 --> 02:10:55.281 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A PLEASANT PLACE FOR

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:56.382 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO WORK WHERE THEY ARE

02:10:55.281 --> 02:10:58.884 region:rollup2
RESPECTED AND WHERE THEIR

02:10:56.382 --> 02:11:01.687 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE RESPECTED AND

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:02.254 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE. SO WE CAN

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.122 region:rollup2
NEVER SWING TOO FAR IN THAT

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.956 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

WITH COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. AND

02:13:38.177 --> 02:13:40.746 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN REALLY NO

02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:42.414 region:rollup2

02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:43.883 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH EMPLOYERS ARE ARE

NUMBERS OF CHARGES THAT EOC AND

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:53.759 region:rollup2

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:54.326 region:rollup2
THE COURT CASES HAVE REALLY NOT

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.862 region:rollup2
CHANGED THROUGH THE DECADES

02:13:54.326 --> 02:13:58.864 region:rollup2
BOMB.

02:13:56.862 --> 02:14:01.033 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE.

02:13:58.864 --> 02:14:03.302 region:rollup2
THAT MOST COMMITTED EMPLOYERS

02:14:01.033 --> 02:14:05.504 region:rollup2
CAN DO A BETTER JOB.

02:14:03.302 --> 02:14:07.206 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN DO

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:09.608 region:rollup2
FAR MORE.

02:14:07.206 --> 02:14:11.410 region:rollup2
THEN CHECK THE BOX FAR MORE THAN

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:13.245 region:rollup2
JUST COMPLIANCE AND I I THINK

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.812 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT

02:14:13.245 --> 02:14:15.581 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TAKING.

02:14:13.812 --> 02:14:18.217 region:rollup2
.

02:14:15.581 --> 02:14:20.019 region:rollup2
I AM INFORMED ABOUT THIS

02:14:18.217 --> 02:14:22.021 region:rollup2
APPROACH MORE THAN COMPLIANCE

02:14:20.019 --> 02:14:23.222 region:rollup2
MORE THAN CHECK IN THE BOX AND I

02:14:22.021 --> 02:14:25.090 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN GO

02:14:23.222 --> 02:14:27.393 region:rollup2
FAR BEYOND THAT BASED ON MY WORK

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:29.261 region:rollup2
WITH THE EOC. AND THE SELECT

02:14:27.393 --> 02:14:30.462 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE MOM I KNOW THAT YOU

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:32.331 region:rollup2
READ THE REPORT IS PART OF THE

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:32.765 region:rollup2
MATERIALS FOR THESE HEARINGS.

02:14:32.331 --> 02:14:34.333 region:rollup2
AND.

02:14:32.765 --> 02:14:36.168 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT

02:14:34.333 --> 02:14:37.336 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL BASED

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:39.572 region:rollup2
ON THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF WORK

02:14:37.336 --> 02:14:41.407 region:rollup2
THAT WE DID. IN STUDYING THE

02:14:39.572 --> 02:14:43.542 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF PREVENTION AND

02:14:41.407 --> 02:14:45.277 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF.

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:46.612 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT I BELIEVE

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:49.214 region:rollup2
THESE HEARINGS SHOW THAT YOU'RE

02:14:46.612 --> 02:14:50.616 region:rollup2
ALREADY FAR ALONG IN THE PROCESS

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:52.384 region:rollup2
OF ESTABLISHING THE FIRST

02:14:50.616 --> 02:14:53.986 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT THE TASK FORCE

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:56.388 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS. THE MOST

02:14:53.986 --> 02:14:58.891 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE PROCESS

02:14:56.388 --> 02:15:00.759 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP.

02:14:58.891 --> 02:15:01.994 region:rollup2
AND I'VE HEARD YOU TALK A LOT

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:04.196 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

02:15:01.994 --> 02:15:06.699 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING A

02:15:04.196 --> 02:15:08.601 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC HARASSMENT PREVENTION

02:15:06.699 --> 02:15:10.035 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS LEADERSHIP.

02:15:08.601 --> 02:15:11.670 region:rollup2
THESE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:13.305 region:rollup2
CRITICAL I THINK IN

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:14.640 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATING YOUR COMMITMENT TO

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:16.208 region:rollup2
THAT. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.143 region:rollup2
TALKED A LOT ABOUT CHANGING THE

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:20.679 region:rollup2
CULTURE WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:21.947 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF ESTABLISHING

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:23.749 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND I KNOW YOU'VE

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:24.650 region:rollup2
HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT

02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:26.452 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:15:24.650 --> 02:15:28.187 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT I LIKE TO

02:15:26.452 --> 02:15:30.456 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING

02:15:28.187 --> 02:15:32.925 region:rollup2
CULTURE IS IT A BASIC MANAGEMENT

02:15:30.456 --> 02:15:35.694 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE. AND THAT IS THE

02:15:32.925 --> 02:15:37.062 region:rollup2
SHADOW OF A LEADER. AND I THINK

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:39.498 region:rollup2
THAT YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW THAT

02:15:37.062 --> 02:15:42.434 region:rollup2
YOU CAST A SHADOW AS LEADERS.

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:44.003 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SHARE AN EXAMPLE FROM

02:15:42.434 --> 02:15:46.572 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT STATE.

02:15:44.003 --> 02:15:48.474 region:rollup2
OF HOW A SHADOW WAS CAST IN AN

02:15:46.572 --> 02:15:50.676 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE WAY. AND I THINK IT

02:15:48.474 --> 02:15:52.711 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATES PERFECTLY WHAT ALL

02:15:50.676 --> 02:15:53.579 region:rollup2
OF YOU CAN DO AS LEADERS IN YOUR

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:56.382 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:58.484 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE.

02:15:56.382 --> 02:15:59.651 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF

02:15:58.484 --> 02:16:01.387 region:rollup2
OF.

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:02.955 region:rollup2
A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND THEIR

02:16:01.387 --> 02:16:04.757 region:rollup2
STAFFERS WERE TOGETHER TO

02:16:02.955 --> 02:16:07.960 region:rollup2
CELEBRATE THE RETIREMENT OF A

02:16:04.757 --> 02:16:10.929 region:rollup2
STAFFER. AND TWO MEMBERS MADE

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:11.864 region:rollup2
REMARKS. AT THE RETIREMENT PARTY

02:16:10.929 --> 02:16:13.032 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS A DINNER SEATED

02:16:11.864 --> 02:16:14.600 region:rollup2
DINNER. AND.

02:16:13.032 --> 02:16:16.402 region:rollup2
THOSE REMARKS WERE

02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:18.837 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE. THEY WERE

02:16:16.402 --> 02:16:20.639 region:rollup2
MISOGYNISTIC.AND THEY WERE.

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:23.042 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TARGETED AT INDIVIDUAL

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:24.777 region:rollup2
FEMALE LEGISLATE TOWARDS ONE A

02:16:23.042 --> 02:16:26.612 region:rollup2
SITTING MEMBER OF THE BODY AND

02:16:24.777 --> 02:16:28.480 region:rollup2
ONE ON THE FORMER AND FORMER

02:16:26.612 --> 02:16:29.715 region:rollup2
MEMBER WHO IS NOT PRESENT THE

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:31.884 region:rollup2
THE SITTING MEMBER WAS PRESENT

02:16:29.715 --> 02:16:33.752 region:rollup2
IN THE AUDIENCE. OF THE SPEAKER

02:16:31.884 --> 02:16:33.952 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO PRESENT.

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:35.487 region:rollup2
AND.

02:16:33.952 --> 02:16:37.256 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE VERY INAPPROPRIATE

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:39.958 region:rollup2
REMARKS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS

02:16:37.256 --> 02:16:41.994 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USED THE C. WORD. TO

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:43.328 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE ONE OF THE FEMALE

02:16:41.994 --> 02:16:46.165 region:rollup2
MEMBERS. AND.

02:16:43.328 --> 02:16:47.1000 region:rollup2
NOTHING HAPPENED.

02:16:46.165 --> 02:16:49.902 region:rollup2
THE DINNER WENT ON. AND AFTER

02:16:47.1000 --> 02:16:52.137 region:rollup2
THE DINNER THE SPEAKER SENT A

02:16:49.902 --> 02:16:54.206 region:rollup2
LETTER TO THE TWO. MEMBERS WHO

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:56.075 region:rollup2
HAD SPOKEN. AND SAID THAT THEY

02:16:54.206 --> 02:16:57.609 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. AND

02:16:56.075 --> 02:16:58.877 region:rollup2
THE TWO MEMBERS SENT LETTERS OF

02:16:57.609 --> 02:17:00.879 region:rollup2
APOLOGY.

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:03.549 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S IT THERE WERE

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:05.017 region:rollup2
NO SANCTIONS. AND WHEN I THINK

02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:06.452 region:rollup2
OF THE SHADOW OF A LEADER.

02:17:05.017 --> 02:17:08.954 region:rollup2
I THINK OF WHAT COULD HAVE

02:17:06.452 --> 02:17:11.323 region:rollup2
HAPPENED. AND MESSAGE THAT COULD

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:13.392 region:rollup2
BEEN SENT NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:15.160 region:rollup2
THERE THAT NIGHT BUT TO EVERYONE

02:17:13.392 --> 02:17:18.363 region:rollup2
IN STATE GOVERNMENT IF THE

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:21.366 region:rollup2
SPEAKER HAD STOOD UP. GONE TO

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:22.801 region:rollup2
THE PODIUM AND MADE THOSE THOSE

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:24.803 region:rollup2
MEN SIT DOWN.

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:27.206 region:rollup2
AND SAD TO THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE I

02:17:24.803 --> 02:17:28.640 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE I'M SORRY FOR THOSE

02:17:27.206 --> 02:17:30.743 region:rollup2
REMARKS I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:32.778 region:rollup2
HEAR THAT WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:35.147 region:rollup2
KIND OF LANGUAGE.

02:17:32.778 --> 02:17:37.783 region:rollup2
CAN AND NOT OPPORTUNITY WAS

02:17:35.147 --> 02:17:40.419 region:rollup2
LOST. AND INSTEAD THE VERY CLEAR

02:17:37.783 --> 02:17:41.954 region:rollup2
MESSAGE WAS.

02:17:40.419 --> 02:17:43.422 region:rollup2
WELL WE TOLERATE THAT.

02:17:41.954 --> 02:17:45.357 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE WRITE A LETTER

02:17:43.422 --> 02:17:47.126 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS BUT BASICALLY WE

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:48.627 region:rollup2
TALLER.

02:17:47.126 --> 02:17:51.096 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA OF

02:17:48.627 --> 02:17:53.799 region:rollup2
THE SHADOW OF A LEADER AND AND

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:56.168 region:rollup2
WHAT LEADERS DO. IS SO CRITICAL

02:17:53.799 --> 02:17:56.735 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA OF HARASSMENT IN

02:17:56.168 --> 02:17:57.936 region:rollup2
ANY CHANGE THAT YOU WANT TO

02:17:56.735 --> 02:17:59.772 region:rollup2
MAKE.

02:17:57.936 --> 02:18:01.807 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY

02:17:59.772 --> 02:18:03.509 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE EVEN TO

02:18:01.807 --> 02:18:05.244 region:rollup2
IMPROVE YOUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS

02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:06.645 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I THINK YOU LIKE MOST

02:18:05.244 --> 02:18:08.447 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ARE COMPLIANCE EFFORTS

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:11.083 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD. WE WE'VE BEEN DOING

02:18:08.447 --> 02:18:13.252 region:rollup2
WELL AS EMPLOYERS FOR DECADES.

02:18:11.083 --> 02:18:15.254 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S

02:18:13.252 --> 02:18:17.055 region:rollup2
MORE TO BE DONE THERE BUT THIS

02:18:15.254 --> 02:18:18.657 region:rollup2
IDEA OF OF THE LEADERS IN THE

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:20.859 region:rollup2
SHADOWS THEY CAST IS.

02:18:18.657 --> 02:18:22.294 region:rollup2
IS REALLY SO SIGNIFICANT PALM I

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:24.096 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF THE.

02:18:22.294 --> 02:18:26.999 region:rollup2
THIS IS TESTIMONY THAT I SAW

02:18:24.096 --> 02:18:28.634 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS PREPARING FOR THIS.

02:18:26.999 --> 02:18:30.369 region:rollup2
HEARING TODAY I SAW ON. THE

02:18:28.634 --> 02:18:32.571 region:rollup2
WITNESSES SAID THAT A CULTURE

02:18:30.369 --> 02:18:34.873 region:rollup2
EATS STRATEGY FOR BREAKFAST AND

02:18:32.571 --> 02:18:36.542 region:rollup2
POLICY FOR LUNCH. AND I LIKE

02:18:34.873 --> 02:18:38.210 region:rollup2
THAT AND I THINK IT MAY BE TRUE

02:18:36.542 --> 02:18:38.677 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF IT IS

02:18:38.210 --> 02:18:40.479 region:rollup2
TRUE.

02:18:38.677 --> 02:18:42.648 region:rollup2
CULTURE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY

02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:44.116 region:rollup2
GOOD DIET SO YOU'VE GOT TO PAY

02:18:42.648 --> 02:18:46.985 region:rollup2
ATTENTION AND BE MINDFUL OF THE

02:18:44.116 --> 02:18:49.021 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THE STRATEGY AS WELL.

02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:51.156 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE THE SELECT TASK

02:18:49.021 --> 02:18:52.791 region:rollup2
FORCE THE REPORT FROM THE EOC

02:18:51.156 --> 02:18:55.327 region:rollup2
DOES SUGGEST THAT YOU.

02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:56.929 region:rollup2
IMPROVE WHAT IS AN ALREADY

02:18:55.327 --> 02:18:59.464 region:rollup2
COMPLIANT POLICY.

02:18:56.929 --> 02:19:01.200 region:rollup2
YOU IMPROVE YOUR TRAINING.

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:02.835 region:rollup2
AND WE WE REALLY FOUND THAT

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.737 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT'S BEEN CONDUCTED

02:19:02.835 --> 02:19:07.806 region:rollup2
BY BY EMPLOYERS FOR DECADES IS

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:09.508 region:rollup2
REALLY IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE SO ALL

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:11.176 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS REALLY NEED TO FOCUS

02:19:09.508 --> 02:19:13.145 region:rollup2
ON THAT. AND THAT WE CONSIDER

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:14.913 region:rollup2
ADDING ADDITIONAL TYPES OF

02:19:13.145 --> 02:19:16.849 region:rollup2
TRAINING CIVILITY AND RESPECT

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:19.585 region:rollup2
WAS AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST.

02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:20.085 region:rollup2
WE FOUND.

02:19:19.585 --> 02:19:24.189 region:rollup2
YES AND WE FOUND THAT.

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:25.224 region:rollup2
DISRESPECT IN CIVILITY AND

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:27.025 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE.

02:19:25.224 --> 02:19:27.526 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS IN THE WORKPLACE

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:29.428 region:rollup2
REALLY WERE THOSE WERE A

02:19:27.526 --> 02:19:31.530 region:rollup2
GATEWAY.

02:19:29.428 --> 02:19:33.665 region:rollup2
WE WE. WE DIDN'T JOKE WASN'T

02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:35.300 region:rollup2
FUNNY BUT WE WE KIND OF USE THE

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:36.735 region:rollup2
TERM THEY WERE GATEWAY DRUG FOR

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:38.770 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IF YOU ALLOWED

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:40.038 region:rollup2
DISRESPECT AND INCIVILITY IN THE

02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:42.007 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE YOU COULD EXPECT.

02:19:40.038 --> 02:19:44.409 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TO FOLLOW SO.

02:19:42.007 --> 02:19:45.844 region:rollup2
THE EOC DID AS AS THE LAST

02:19:44.409 --> 02:19:47.279 region:rollup2
PANEL MENTIONED THEY'VE

02:19:45.844 --> 02:19:49.815 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED AN ENTIRE.

02:19:47.279 --> 02:19:52.584 region:rollup2
NEW TRAINING MODULE ON RESPECT

02:19:49.815 --> 02:19:54.786 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE. BOMB BYSTANDER

02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:57.422 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT'S A SOMETHING IT'S

02:19:54.786 --> 02:19:59.324 region:rollup2
A TOOL THAT WE'VE NOT UTILIZE WE

02:19:57.422 --> 02:20:01.159 region:rollup2
STUDIED A LOT OF WHAT COLLEGES

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:02.094 region:rollup2
AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN DOING

02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:03.896 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE DEVELOPED

02:20:02.094 --> 02:20:05.898 region:rollup2
SOME REALLY EFFECTIVE BYSTANDER

02:20:03.896 --> 02:20:06.932 region:rollup2
TECHNIQUES. WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED

02:20:05.898 --> 02:20:08.233 region:rollup2
FOR THE WORK PLACE VERY

02:20:06.932 --> 02:20:11.203 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

02:20:08.233 --> 02:20:12.371 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS AND I THINK

02:20:11.203 --> 02:20:13.739 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU HAVE.

02:20:12.371 --> 02:20:15.207 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS

02:20:13.739 --> 02:20:16.875 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT ON THIS IN THESE

02:20:15.207 --> 02:20:19.244 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AS WELL THAT'S VERY

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:20.746 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE I'M YOUR SUPERVISORS.

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:22.714 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE LAST PANEL TALKED

02:20:20.746 --> 02:20:24.449 region:rollup2
ABOUT SUPERVISORS AND THEY NEED

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:25.417 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND

02:20:24.449 --> 02:20:26.518 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY

02:20:25.417 --> 02:20:28.987 region:rollup2
DON'T THEY DON'T NEED TO BECOME

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:30.923 region:rollup2
EXPERTS ON HARASSMENT. SOME WILL

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:32.958 region:rollup2
SUMMER CAPABLE OF THAT SUMMER

02:20:30.923 --> 02:20:34.159 region:rollup2
NOT THEY JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND

02:20:32.958 --> 02:20:36.461 region:rollup2
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:38.096 region:rollup2
MOVING ISSUES FORWARD KNOWING

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:40.933 region:rollup2
WHERE TO TAKE A PERSON OR WHAT

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:44.169 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS A

02:20:40.933 --> 02:20:46.605 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT. YOUR INVESTIGATORS ON

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:49.875 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT YOU USE INTERNAL

02:20:46.605 --> 02:20:50.575 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS AND I TOO AM VERY

02:20:49.875 --> 02:20:55.781 region:rollup2
MUCH IN FAVOR OF INTERNAL

02:20:50.575 --> 02:20:57.649 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS. UP TO A SITUATION

02:20:55.781 --> 02:21:01.053 region:rollup2
WHERE THE INVESTIGATOR DOESN'T.

02:20:57.649 --> 02:21:04.589 region:rollup2
IT IS REPORTING LITERALLY A

02:21:01.053 --> 02:21:09.528 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATE TO ON EITHER THE THE

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:10.462 region:rollup2
VICTIM THE ALLEGED VICTIM OR ON

02:21:09.528 --> 02:21:12.597 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO'S ACCUSED IF THEY

02:21:10.462 --> 02:21:15.634 region:rollup2
HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:18.770 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

02:21:15.634 --> 02:21:21.306 region:rollup2
NOT A SITUATION THAT CAN WORK

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:23.675 region:rollup2
BUT BUT SHORT OF THAT.

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:29.748 region:rollup2
AND AND THE PEOPLE THEN WHO ARE

02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:32.851 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS THE NEED CONTINUAL

02:21:29.748 --> 02:21:36.088 region:rollup2
TRAINING. ARM AND AND THEY WILL

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:40.659 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THOUGH THE ONE

02:21:36.088 --> 02:21:41.159 region:rollup2
OF THE KEEP IMPROVING. ON

02:21:40.659 --> 02:21:46.531 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SINCE ONE OF

02:21:41.159 --> 02:21:47.833 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL A

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:49.001 region:rollup2
SOLUTION I'VE SEEN IN SOME

02:21:47.833 --> 02:21:50.702 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES AN ARM BUT THIS

02:21:49.001 --> 02:21:52.404 region:rollup2
PERSON.

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:53.772 region:rollup2
AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO

02:21:52.404 --> 02:21:55.207 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHO CAN TAKE THOSE

02:21:53.772 --> 02:21:57.409 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THOSE ISSUES THAT DON'T

02:21:55.207 --> 02:21:59.378 region:rollup2
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF HARASSMENT.

02:21:57.409 --> 02:22:02.014 region:rollup2
ARM AND THEN ANOTHER KEY

02:21:59.378 --> 02:22:03.782 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THAT THE TASK FORCE

02:22:02.014 --> 02:22:05.517 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS IS ELIMINATING FIRST

02:22:03.782 --> 02:22:07.953 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING. AND THEN

02:22:05.517 --> 02:22:10.155 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING RISK FACTORS IN THE

02:22:07.953 --> 02:22:12.524 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND WE IDENTIFIED

02:22:10.155 --> 02:22:14.826 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SOME RISK FACTORS THAT

02:22:12.524 --> 02:22:16.128 region:rollup2
WE SAW AS WE SURVEYED CASES THAT

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:17.662 region:rollup2
HAD DEVELOPED IN THE AREA OF

02:22:16.128 --> 02:22:19.664 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:21.166 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE I'D JUST AS I WENT

02:22:19.664 --> 02:22:22.334 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LIST OF IDENTIFIED

02:22:21.166 --> 02:22:24.369 region:rollup2
RISK FACTORS AND AND YOU HAVE

02:22:22.334 --> 02:22:24.903 region:rollup2
SOME SPECIFIC ONES I'M SURE THAT

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:27.205 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AWARE OF WHICH IS

02:22:24.903 --> 02:22:29.341 region:rollup2
GENERALLY. YOU HAVE A LOT OF

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:31.109 region:rollup2
YOUNGER EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES WHO

02:22:29.341 --> 02:22:33.044 region:rollup2
ARE ON PERHAPS THEIR FIRST OR

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:35.680 region:rollup2
SECOND NON JOB AND I THINK THAT

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:36.048 region:rollup2
TIES IN. WITH WHAT YOU WERE

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:39.151 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

02:22:36.048 --> 02:22:41.119 region:rollup2
MEMBER MORLOCK ABOUT OF HIGH

02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:42.487 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TO ANSWER A

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:44.389 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:47.025 region:rollup2
THE EOC HAS SPECIFIC TRAINING

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:49.628 region:rollup2
FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS I DO

02:22:47.025 --> 02:22:51.930 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT'S TOO LATE BUT. OFTEN

02:22:49.628 --> 02:22:53.865 region:rollup2
HAVE A LEASE TRY TO REACH THEM

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:55.233 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST JOB

02:22:53.865 --> 02:22:56.568 region:rollup2
SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT

02:22:55.233 --> 02:22:59.604 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:22:56.568 --> 02:23:02.007 region:rollup2
YOUNG WORK FORCE. NOT SUGGESTING

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:03.975 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BUT SOME

02:23:02.007 --> 02:23:04.876 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THEY DON'T

02:23:03.975 --> 02:23:07.546 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:08.180 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. OUR WHAT TO EXPECT

02:23:07.546 --> 02:23:08.780 region:rollup2
IN A WORKPLACE THEY'VE BEEN IN A

02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:10.282 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:13.318 region:rollup2
BEEN IN A COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT.

02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:15.720 region:rollup2
SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND KIND

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:17.255 region:rollup2
OF HOW THINGS SHOULD WORK AND IF

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:19.658 region:rollup2
THEY SEE A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:24.062 region:rollup2
WHERE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IS

02:23:19.658 --> 02:23:24.563 region:rollup2
TOLERATED OR INCIVILITY

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:25.263 region:rollup2
DISRESPECT IS THE NORM.

02:23:24.563 --> 02:23:26.465 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THEY KNOW THEN AS A

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:27.232 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE SO ON AND THEY ARE

02:23:26.465 --> 02:23:29.801 region:rollup2
ALSO MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PEOPLE

02:23:27.232 --> 02:23:31.837 region:rollup2
WHO ARE. MAYBE OLDER OR WHO HAVE

02:23:29.801 --> 02:23:35.440 region:rollup2
MORE EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY.

02:23:31.837 --> 02:23:37.275 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HIGHER IN AUTHORITY.

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.410 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE

02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:40.245 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN

02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:41.480 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:23:40.245 --> 02:23:43.181 region:rollup2
HAVE MATURED AND THEY DON'T HAVE

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:44.983 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE SO IF THEY SEE OTHERS

02:23:43.181 --> 02:23:46.017 region:rollup2
ENGAGING IN MISCONDUCT AGAIN

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:48.086 region:rollup2
THEY JUST ASSUME THAT THAT'S

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:50.589 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. THEY ALSO LACK THE

02:23:48.086 --> 02:23:51.857 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE. OF HAVING EXPERIENCE

02:23:50.589 --> 02:23:54.392 region:rollup2
OF A LACK CONFIDENCE TO

02:23:51.857 --> 02:23:55.527 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE BEHAVIORS THAT THAT

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:56.895 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY EVEN THEY DO THINK

02:23:55.527 --> 02:23:58.363 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE INAPPROPRIATE BUT

02:23:56.895 --> 02:23:59.531 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT

02:23:58.363 --> 02:24:02.501 region:rollup2
THOSE BEHAVIORS.

02:23:59.531 --> 02:24:04.402 region:rollup2
AND SO AGAIN FOR THEM TRAINING

02:24:02.501 --> 02:24:06.171 region:rollup2
IS CRITICAL AND I'LL COME BACK

02:24:04.402 --> 02:24:08.406 region:rollup2
TO THAT CONCEPT OF THE SHADOW OF

02:24:06.171 --> 02:24:09.941 region:rollup2
THE LEADER. WHAT ARE THEY SEEING

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:12.110 region:rollup2
THE LEADERS DO WHAT IS THAT THE

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:13.545 region:rollup2
SHADOW THAT'S BEING PASSED ON?

02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:16.214 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO HAVE CLEARLY A

02:24:13.545 --> 02:24:16.815 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WITH HIGH VALUE

02:24:16.214 --> 02:24:18.917 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

02:24:16.815 --> 02:24:19.684 region:rollup2
AND THAT TOO HAS SOME OF THE

02:24:18.917 --> 02:24:24.089 region:rollup2
SAME RISKS.

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:26.091 region:rollup2
THEY MAY BE PERMITTED TO.

02:24:24.089 --> 02:24:27.459 region:rollup2
OPERATE OUTSIDE THE RULES OR

02:24:26.091 --> 02:24:29.394 region:rollup2
THEY MAY PERCEIVE THAT THEY ARE

02:24:27.459 --> 02:24:31.229 region:rollup2
PERMITTED ON THE RULES DON'T

02:24:29.394 --> 02:24:32.998 region:rollup2
APPLY TO THEM IS KIND OF THE.

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:34.533 region:rollup2
THE SUPERSTAR HARASSER IF YOU

02:24:32.998 --> 02:24:36.902 region:rollup2
WILL IS THE TERM THAT WE USED

02:24:34.533 --> 02:24:39.337 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE AGAIN RULES NEED TO BE

02:24:36.902 --> 02:24:40.972 region:rollup2
APPLIED UNIFORMLY HOW YOU KNOW

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:42.541 region:rollup2
HOW IS THE LEADERSHIP HOW ARE

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:45.410 region:rollup2
THEY TREATING THOSE PEOPLE.

02:24:42.541 --> 02:24:47.345 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT POWER DISPARITIES.

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:49.548 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:51.216 region:rollup2
POWER DISPARITIES AMONG PEOPLE

02:24:49.548 --> 02:24:53.318 region:rollup2
WHO ARE INTERACTING IN THIS

02:24:51.216 --> 02:24:55.654 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. BOMB.

02:24:53.318 --> 02:24:57.889 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

02:24:55.654 --> 02:24:58.790 region:rollup2
I AM TOLD THAT I'M AT TIMES

02:24:57.889 --> 02:25:00.392 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE ALCOHOL

02:24:58.790 --> 02:25:02.827 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION DURING AN AROUND

02:25:00.392 --> 02:25:04.396 region:rollup2
WORK HOURS THAT'S A RISK FACTOR

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:06.831 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT. WILL.

02:25:04.396 --> 02:25:09.467 region:rollup2
REDUCE INNOVATIONS IMPAIRED

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:11.603 region:rollup2
JUDGMENT SO AGAIN.

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:13.405 region:rollup2
THOSE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE

02:25:11.603 --> 02:25:15.207 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ARE THE WHAT SHOULD.

02:25:13.405 --> 02:25:16.107 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT IN OUR CULTURE MOVE

02:25:15.207 --> 02:25:17.776 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE DON'T WANNA CHANGE IT

02:25:16.107 --> 02:25:19.411 region:rollup2
AT ALL BUT WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL

02:25:17.776 --> 02:25:21.479 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND THE RISKS THAT THAT

02:25:19.411 --> 02:25:24.349 region:rollup2
COULD? POTENTIALLY CREATE.

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:26.952 region:rollup2
CRUDE OR DEMEANING LANGUAGE.

02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:29.054 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT'S THE NORM IN A

02:25:26.952 --> 02:25:31.056 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND. THERE'S NO RULE

02:25:29.054 --> 02:25:32.557 region:rollup2
AGAINST IT. SOMETIMES A

02:25:31.056 --> 02:25:33.825 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WILL DECIDE WE'RE

02:25:32.557 --> 02:25:35.760 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE NO PROFANITY

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:38.597 region:rollup2
WHATSOEVER AGAIN A CULTURAL

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:41.066 region:rollup2
CHOICE BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

02:25:38.597 --> 02:25:43.368 region:rollup2
KIND OF LANGUAGE MAY DEVALUE.

02:25:41.066 --> 02:25:46.538 region:rollup2
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS.

02:25:43.368 --> 02:25:48.773 region:rollup2
SOME EMPLOYEES IF THEY DO WANT

02:25:46.538 --> 02:25:49.441 region:rollup2
TO OR IF THEY DO EXPRESS AN

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:51.943 region:rollup2
OPINION.

02:25:49.441 --> 02:25:53.945 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:56.147 region:rollup2
THEY MAY BE VIEWED AS A KIND OF

02:25:53.945 --> 02:25:56.948 region:rollup2
OUTCASTS AND MAY BE VIEWED AS A

02:25:56.147 --> 02:26:00.418 region:rollup2
WEAKER.

02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:01.686 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THE CULTURE THE SHADOW

02:26:00.418 --> 02:26:04.055 region:rollup2
OF A LEADER THOSE KINDS OF

02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:05.457 region:rollup2
THINGS SO. PART OF YOUR EFFORTS

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:07.459 region:rollup2
I THINK SHOULD BE.

02:26:05.457 --> 02:26:08.860 region:rollup2
TARGETED AT IDENTIFYING THE

02:26:07.459 --> 02:26:10.095 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS THAT YOU

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:13.298 region:rollup2
SEE AND.

02:26:10.095 --> 02:26:14.966 region:rollup2
AND THEN RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES

02:26:13.298 --> 02:26:16.901 region:rollup2
RESOLVING THOSE RISK FACTORS AND

02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:18.770 region:rollup2
THEN SOMEONE WILL SAY HOW DO WE

02:26:16.901 --> 02:26:20.405 region:rollup2
DO THAT AND I WILL SAY. THAT'S

02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:22.741 region:rollup2
UP TO ALL OF YOU AND BY ALL OF

02:26:20.405 --> 02:26:25.844 region:rollup2
YOU I WOULD SAY ENGAGE YOUR WORK

02:26:22.741 --> 02:26:29.247 region:rollup2
FORCE. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT FOR

02:26:25.844 --> 02:26:31.750 region:rollup2
YOU BUT I WILL I WILL TELL YOU

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:37.956 region:rollup2
YOUR STAFF THEY KNOW PROBABLY A

02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:43.662 region:rollup2
LOT MORE. ABOUT THIS THIS. WORK

02:26:37.956 --> 02:26:46.531 region:rollup2
SPACE. THEN ALL OF YOU DO AND SO

02:26:43.662 --> 02:26:49.534 region:rollup2
I WOULD ENGAGE THEM DO A CLIMATE

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:50.869 region:rollup2
SURVEY DO FOCUS GROUPS GET THEIR

02:26:49.534 --> 02:26:54.606 region:rollup2
INPUT.

02:26:50.869 --> 02:26:58.176 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU

02:26:54.606 --> 02:27:00.378 region:rollup2
WANT TO DRESS ASK THEM. WATER

02:26:58.176 --> 02:27:01.513 region:rollup2
IDEAS THAT THEY HAVE FOR SOLVING

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:05.216 region:rollup2
THAT AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS

02:27:01.513 --> 02:27:09.854 region:rollup2
THOSE RISK FACTORS SO THOSE ARE

02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:11.623 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS ON. THAT I

02:27:09.854 --> 02:27:17.162 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST FOR ABOUT IN TERMS

02:27:11.623 --> 02:27:17.796 region:rollup2
OF LEADERSHIP. THIS HAS TO BE

02:27:17.162 --> 02:27:22.067 region:rollup2
THAT LEADERS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE

02:27:17.796 --> 02:27:24.235 region:rollup2
WHO

02:27:22.067 --> 02:27:26.171 region:rollup2
ARE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD

02:27:24.235 --> 02:27:28.540 region:rollup2
POPULAR WHO CAN LEAD A CULTURE

02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:30.809 region:rollup2
CHANGE WHO PEOPLE LOOK UP TO

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:33.645 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THOSE PEOPLE AS WELL.

02:27:30.809 --> 02:27:34.612 region:rollup2
AND ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES AND

02:27:33.645 --> 02:27:37.849 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT

02:27:34.612 --> 02:27:40.318 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN DOLLARS. BUT

02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:41.986 region:rollup2
THE DOLLARS THAT ARE ALLOCATED

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:43.521 region:rollup2
USE THOSE EFFECTIVELY AND THAT'S

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:44.622 region:rollup2
ANOTHER REASON AGAIN THAT I

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:47.926 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY SUPPORT.

02:27:44.622 --> 02:27:50.061 region:rollup2
INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS UP TO

02:27:47.926 --> 02:27:51.529 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT LEVEL OF AND I THINK

02:27:50.061 --> 02:27:53.465 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE

02:27:51.529 --> 02:27:55.266 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOT I'VE MET SOME OF

02:27:53.465 --> 02:27:56.968 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE. A LOT OF

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:57.635 region:rollup2
TOWN INTERNALLY BUT YOU KNOW YOU

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:59.204 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:27:57.635 --> 02:28:01.106 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN INVESTIGATORS THEY KNOW

02:27:59.204 --> 02:28:02.741 region:rollup2
YOUR CULTURE.

02:28:01.106 --> 02:28:04.509 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THEY KNOW A PERSON'S

02:28:02.741 --> 02:28:06.010 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT HISTORY THE PERSON

02:28:04.509 --> 02:28:06.544 region:rollup2
WHO YOU KNOW PEOPLE AND ALL THE

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:08.546 region:rollup2
WITNESSES THEY KNOW THOSE

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:09.914 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:11.783 region:rollup2
FAR MORE THAN WHAT THEY WOULD

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:13.685 region:rollup2
FIND IN A PERSONNEL FILE RIGHT

02:28:11.783 --> 02:28:15.286 region:rollup2
SO YOU GIVE UP A LOT OF THAT

02:28:13.685 --> 02:28:16.621 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. WHEN

02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:19.057 region:rollup2
YOU GO OUTSIDE AND OBVIOUSLY

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:20.191 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOT MORE COST EFFECTIVE

02:28:19.057 --> 02:28:21.726 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT AS WELL.

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:23.495 region:rollup2
.

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:25.330 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REPORTING

02:28:23.495 --> 02:28:26.998 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS WORKING. I WOULD

02:28:25.330 --> 02:28:27.899 region:rollup2
SUGGEST YOU SHOULD TEST THE

02:28:26.998 --> 02:28:29.701 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:28:27.899 --> 02:28:33.071 region:rollup2
KLAY.

02:28:29.701 --> 02:28:35.607 region:rollup2
CREATE A CLAIM AND SEE IF WHAT

02:28:33.071 --> 02:28:37.308 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TO IT. WHERE DOES IT GO

02:28:35.607 --> 02:28:38.710 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING?

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:40.845 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE OF COURSE SHOULD BE

02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:42.313 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONATE I THINK THAT YOU

02:28:40.845 --> 02:28:44.783 region:rollup2
ALL HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT.

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:46.918 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT

02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:48.620 region:rollup2
INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS CAN HELP

02:28:46.918 --> 02:28:49.921 region:rollup2
WITH THEY CAN REMEMBER THE LAST

02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:52.023 region:rollup2
TIME SOMEONE WAS ACCUSED OF

02:28:49.921 --> 02:28:53.691 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SIMILAR. AND HOW THAT

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:56.027 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT TO HAVE KIND OF THAT

02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:57.362 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND AN

02:28:56.027 --> 02:29:01.132 region:rollup2
CAN RECORD THAT AS WELL.

02:28:57.362 --> 02:29:02.467 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MANAGERS ON

02:29:01.132 --> 02:29:04.803 region:rollup2
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LEADERS

02:29:02.467 --> 02:29:06.671 region:rollup2
SHOULD SHOULD FIND WAYS TO HOLD

02:29:04.803 --> 02:29:07.505 region:rollup2
MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS

02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:10.008 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:12.410 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS MEASURED MATTERS

02:29:10.008 --> 02:29:14.112 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT AGAIN THE

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:16.815 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAINING?

02:29:14.112 --> 02:29:18.249 region:rollup2
AND CLIMATE SURVEYS FOCUS

02:29:16.815 --> 02:29:21.386 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

02:29:18.249 --> 02:29:22.987 region:rollup2
AND I'D I THINK THERE'S THERE

02:29:21.386 --> 02:29:24.489 region:rollup2
AGAIN THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD THAT

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:25.990 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE ON SEVERAL FRONTS

02:29:24.489 --> 02:29:28.226 region:rollup2
BUT IMPROVING ALL OF THE

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:31.262 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE PIECES. THAT ARE

02:29:28.226 --> 02:29:35.133 region:rollup2
ALREADY DONE WELL AND MAKING

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:37.669 region:rollup2
THOSE BETTER AND THEN AGAIN THE

02:29:35.133 --> 02:29:38.837 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP IS JUST IT'S REALLY

02:29:37.669 --> 02:29:43.441 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO COME BACK

02:29:38.837 --> 02:29:46.878 region:rollup2
TO THE LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S IT'S

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:47.645 region:rollup2
JUST VERY EXCITING TO SEE. ALL

02:29:46.878 --> 02:29:49.514 region:rollup2

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:35.533 region:rollup2
THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS.

02:39:33.064 --> 02:39:37.301 region:rollup2
LASTED FIVE MONTHS VERY BY NOT

02:39:35.533 --> 02:39:39.537 region:rollup2
SIMPLE YOU KNOW THEY TAKE A LONG

02:39:37.301 --> 02:39:42.807 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:39:39.537 --> 02:39:45.109 region:rollup2
ARE THERE NOT QUICK FIXES.

02:39:42.807 --> 02:39:46.777 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE FIXES USUALLY.

02:39:45.109 --> 02:39:48.379 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS WERE HANDLE TO THE

02:39:46.777 --> 02:39:49.880 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION OF THE PARTICIPANTS

02:39:48.379 --> 02:39:51.315 region:rollup2

THEIR RULES COMMITTEE OR THE

02:39:52.483 --> 02:39:55.352 region:rollup2
STUDENT CONDUCT COMMITTEE.

02:39:53.751 --> 02:39:56.854 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG MEN

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:59.123 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY REMEDIATED THEIR

02:39:56.854 --> 02:40:00.324 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR ALL THROUGH COMPLETION

02:39:59.123 --> 02:40:01.826 region:rollup2
OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

02:40:00.324 --> 02:40:03.828 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD

02:40:01.826 --> 02:40:05.396 region:rollup2
NOT BE EXPELLED. THEY HAD TO

02:40:03.828 --> 02:40:06.997 region:rollup2
FURTHER DECISION ADULT TO

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:09.633 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:40:08.165 --> 02:40:11.502 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WERE ENORMOUS

02:40:09.633 --> 02:40:13.304 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY EXCEPTIONAL LEVEL OF

02:40:11.502 --> 02:40:15.105 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND MEDIA ATTENTION. MUCH

02:40:13.304 --> 02:40:16.740 region:rollup2
BASED ON LOUD OUTCRIES FOR

02:40:15.105 --> 02:40:18.609 region:rollup2
PUNISHMENT.

02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:20.644 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I ALSO BELIEVE THIS WAS

02:40:18.609 --> 02:40:22.613 region:rollup2
A GAME CHANGER IN MODELER

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:25.015 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE INTERVENTION TO

CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:41:11.929 --> 02:41:16.367 region:rollup2
I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING

02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:17.635 region:rollup2
AN AMOUNT OF SCOTIA HALIFAX AND

02:41:16.367 --> 02:41:18.936 region:rollup2

02:41:34.952 --> 02:41:38.722 region:rollup2
AND I QUOTE.

02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:40.357 region:rollup2
FOR US. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WAS

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:42.426 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION TO A COMPLICATED

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:44.194 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE'RE SMALL CLASS FROM A

02:41:42.426 --> 02:41:46.130 region:rollup2
SMALL SCHOOL AND WE'RE TIGHT

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:47.765 region:rollup2
KNIT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT WE

02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:49.333 region:rollup2
HAD COME TO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT

02:41:47.765 --> 02:41:50.434 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER AS CLASSMATES AND HIS

02:41:49.333 --> 02:41:52.202 region:rollup2
FRIENDS.

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:53.571 region:rollup2
IT WAS THIS CARING THAT MADE THE

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:55.339 region:rollup2
REALIZATION OF THE FACEBOOK

02:41:53.571 --> 02:41:57.274 region:rollup2

RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROVIDED US

02:41:58.742 --> 02:42:01.245 region:rollup2
WITH A DIFFERENT SORT OF

JUSTICE.

02:42:01.245 --> 02:42:04.982 region:rollup2
THEN THE PUTATIVE TYPE MOST OF

02:42:03.347 --> 02:42:07.218 region:rollup2
THE LOUDEST PUBLIC VOICES SEEM

02:42:04.982 --> 02:42:08.352 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE WERE CLEAR FROM THE

THIRTEEN ANGRY MEN WANT US TO

KNOW MORE THAN THEY DID THE DAY

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:19.697 region:rollup2
THE POSTS WERE UNCOVERED.

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:21.332 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ACOUNTABILITY. NOR

02:42:19.697 --> 02:42:23.067 region:rollup2
DO WE WANT SIMPLY TO FORGIVE AND

02:42:21.332 --> 02:42:24.168 region:rollup2
FORGET.

02:42:23.067 --> 02:42:25.803 region:rollup2
RATHER WE WERE LOOKING FOR A

02:42:24.168 --> 02:42:27.838 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

02:42:25.803 --> 02:42:30.107 region:rollup2

BUILDING CIRCLES WHERE THEY

02:48:36.873 --> 02:48:40.644 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY DEEP DISCUSIONS.

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:42.913 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THE THE POWER OF

02:48:40.644 --> 02:48:47.217 region:rollup2
THESE CIRCLES IS SOMETHING THAT

02:48:42.913 --> 02:48:50.387 region:rollup2

OF HOW POWERFUL THESE CIRCLES

02:49:03.734 --> 02:49:09.906 region:rollup2
ARE IN TERMS OF CREATING A SPACE

02:49:06.570 --> 02:49:14.177 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE TO SPEAK

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:17.381 region:rollup2
THEIR TRUTH. ARM AND IN WAYS

AND THESE ARE THE KIND OF

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:00.691 region:rollup2
CIRCLES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY

SCENARIOS OF HOW WE COULD DO

02:50:07.597 --> 02:50:10.834 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S. YOU

02:50:09.132 --> 02:50:12.369 region:rollup2
KNOW WE SHOULDN'T BE. PROBABLY

02:50:10.834 --> 02:50:13.136 region:rollup2

ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE

02:50:13.136 --> 02:50:15.205 region:rollup2

02:50:13.904 --> 02:50:16.506 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT I'M

02:50:15.205 --> 02:50:18.608 region:rollup2

AFTER THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT.

02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:26.750 region:rollup2
IS A TYPICAL THAT THEY WILL BE

02:50:25.415 --> 02:50:27.751 region:rollup2
UP TO THE VICTIM TO DECIDE IF

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:29.352 region:rollup2

ABOUT USING THE RESTORATIVE

02:50:47.504 --> 02:50:51.408 region:rollup2
JUSTICE FOR THE LESS SERIOUS

CASES THAT CROSS THE LINE TO

02:50:54.578 --> 02:50:57.914 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T WANT THE

02:50:55.612 --> 02:50:58.715 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPTION WHERE

FIRED OR DO YOU THINK THAT THIS

02:51:01.885 --> 02:51:05.088 region:rollup2

I DON'T I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY

02:51:13.530 --> 02:51:17.033 region:rollup2
REALLY HARMFUL TO EXPEL. IF IT'S

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:19.369 region:rollup2

SAYING WE WANT TO CHANGE IT TO

OUR YOUTH BECAUSE WE I WAS GOING

02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:30.367 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT. I THINK THAT IT'S A

02:53:28.465 --> 02:53:33.703 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT I THINK IF IF IT'S

02:53:30.367 --> 02:53:35.472 region:rollup2
OUR YOUTH THEN IT COULD BE USED

02:53:33.703 --> 02:53:37.741 region:rollup2

FOR ALL OF US NEED IT. IT'S

02:53:39.843 --> 02:53:43.580 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:44.948 region:rollup2
THE TWO. THINGS. THAT YOU TALKED

02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:46.916 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SHADOW OF THE LEADER

02:53:44.948 --> 02:53:49.019 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN MY

02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:50.954 region:rollup2
NOTES I HAD NOTED THAT OFTEN

02:53:49.019 --> 02:53:52.122 region:rollup2
TIMES TO TALK ABOUT MANAGERS AND

02:53:50.954 --> 02:53:54.858 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO MANAGES THE

02:53:52.122 --> 02:53:55.558 region:rollup2
SITUATION SOMEONE WHO MANAGES

02:53:54.858 --> 02:53:56.960 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE.

02:53:55.558 --> 02:53:58.662 region:rollup2
BUT WE REALLY NEED LEADERS. WE

02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:00.297 region:rollup2
NEED LEADERS WHO IN THE SHADOW

02:53:58.662 --> 02:54:02.332 region:rollup2
OF THAT LEADER THAT SETS THE

02:54:00.297 --> 02:54:04.401 region:rollup2
TONE FOR THE REST OF THE STAFF

02:54:02.332 --> 02:54:06.803 region:rollup2
THE SETS A TONE. FOR THE REST OF

02:54:04.401 --> 02:54:08.571 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEES OF COULD YOU TALK

02:54:06.803 --> 02:54:09.906 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:13.877 region:rollup2
THE NEED OR THE DIFFERENCE

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:15.545 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A LEADER AND A MANAGER.

02:54:13.877 --> 02:54:17.781 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT LEADERS IS A MUCH

02:54:15.545 --> 02:54:19.482 region:rollup2
BROADER CONCEPT. OF I THINK

02:54:17.781 --> 02:54:22.852 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS ARE ALL

02:54:19.482 --> 02:54:24.688 region:rollup2
LEADERS I'M MANAGERS I HOPE. OUR

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:26.389 region:rollup2
LEADERS YOUR BEST MANAGERS

02:54:24.688 --> 02:54:27.390 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OUR LEADERS AND THEN I

02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:29.826 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:30.860 region:rollup2
HAVE TITLES NECESSARILY BECAUSE

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:32.462 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OFFICIAL

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:34.297 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY BUT THEY

02:54:32.462 --> 02:54:36.866 region:rollup2
TOO ARE LEADERS. TO THINK

02:54:34.297 --> 02:54:39.102 region:rollup2
LEADERS IS A VERY BROAD CONCEPT

02:54:36.866 --> 02:54:40.270 region:rollup2
I TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO.

02:54:39.102 --> 02:54:42.172 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:54:40.270 --> 02:54:44.808 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FOLLOW THEM PEOPLE LOOK

02:54:42.172 --> 02:54:47.944 region:rollup2
UP TO THEM. MAYBE MENTORS.

02:54:44.808 --> 02:54:49.212 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE LEADERS SO I THINK

02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:52.582 region:rollup2
LEADER IS A VERY.

02:54:49.212 --> 02:54:53.683 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE CATEGORY TO THEIR THE

02:54:52.582 --> 02:54:55.085 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL LEADERS IN THE

02:54:53.683 --> 02:54:56.386 region:rollup2
UNOFFICIAL LEADERS AND NOT SO

02:54:55.085 --> 02:54:59.389 region:rollup2
I'M REFERRING TO AND THEY ALL

02:54:56.386 --> 02:55:01.257 region:rollup2
CAST A SHADOW. AND HOPEFULLY OF

02:54:59.389 --> 02:55:03.026 region:rollup2
THE SHADOWS A POSITIVE ONE AND

02:55:01.257 --> 02:55:05.128 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THEY'RE ALL IN THE

02:55:03.026 --> 02:55:07.297 region:rollup2
SAME DIRECTION. AND YOU ALL HAVE

02:55:05.128 --> 02:55:08.965 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT ABOUT THE CULTURE YOU

02:55:07.297 --> 02:55:10.633 region:rollup2
WANT TO CREATE.

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:11.901 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL IT WAS INTERESTING.

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:14.237 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING I WAS IN A BIBLE

02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:16.139 region:rollup2

LIGHT ONE WICKED THINGS ARE DONE

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:21.611 region:rollup2
IN DARKNESS THEY REMAIN IN

02:55:20.410 --> 02:55:25.048 region:rollup2
DARKNESS AND WHEN YOU PUT SHED

02:55:21.611 --> 02:55:27.650 region:rollup2
LIGHT ON IT I THINK THE CIRCLE.

02:55:25.048 --> 02:55:30.553 region:rollup2
OF SHEDS LIGHT ON. THE THE BAD

02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:32.489 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO RESTORING IT

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:34.124 region:rollup2
TO THE HARM THAT DOES HAPPEN TO

02:55:32.489 --> 02:55:37.060 region:rollup2

SHAKING MY HEAD.

02:55:54.043 --> 02:55:57.714 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RECOGNIZING THAT. AS

02:55:55.712 --> 02:55:59.215 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED KIND OF AN ABSTRACT

02:55:57.714 --> 02:56:00.450 region:rollup2
ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE SOME PEOPLE

02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:02.352 region:rollup2
OF STRUGGLE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE

WITH WITH IS IT WOULD IT LOOK

02:56:03.553 --> 02:56:08.158 region:rollup2
LIKE HOW I KNOW ONE AND IT'S

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:10.260 region:rollup2
CHANGED. AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

02:56:08.158 --> 02:56:12.595 region:rollup2
IS THIS IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A

02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:13.930 region:rollup2
TRUE CULTURE SHIFT AND SO WE

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:15.832 region:rollup2
COULDN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE

02:56:13.930 --> 02:56:17.801 region:rollup2
WE WOULD MANDATE IT ADMIT IT

02:56:15.832 --> 02:56:18.701 region:rollup2
REQUIRES BY IAN. YOU KNOW FOR IT

02:56:17.801 --> 02:56:21.571 region:rollup2
TO WORK.

02:56:18.701 --> 02:56:24.040 region:rollup2
I'M INTRIGUED BY HAD GIVEN THE

02:56:21.571 --> 02:56:26.576 region:rollup2
CULTURE OF THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN

02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.911 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. ROOMS IN SITUATIONS IN

02:56:26.576 --> 02:56:29.345 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN A AND I

02:56:27.911 --> 02:56:31.848 region:rollup2
WAS SITTING HERE AND THINKING

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:33.516 region:rollup2
BACK ABOUT. I WONDER IF WE WOULD

02:56:31.848 --> 02:56:35.151 region:rollup2
HAVE A BODY AND IN THIS SPACE IN

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:36.820 region:rollup2
PLACE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

02:56:35.151 --> 02:56:39.823 region:rollup2
THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS

02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:45.128 region:rollup2
HEARING AND WE BEGIN TO AIR IT.

02:56:39.823 --> 02:56:47.797 region:rollup2
AS AN OPTION FOR US. WHEN I WAS

02:56:45.128 --> 02:56:51.301 region:rollup2
IN THE ASSEMBLY SIX SEVEN YEARS

02:56:47.797 --> 02:56:55.371 region:rollup2
AGO ASSEMBLYWOMAN WILMER CARTER

02:56:51.301 --> 02:56:57.574 region:rollup2
FROM. THE INLAND EMPIRE ALMOST

02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:59.342 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AS I RECALL IN THIS

02:56:57.574 --> 02:57:02.245 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ARENA TO TALK ABOUT

02:56:59.342 --> 02:57:04.414 region:rollup2
IT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING FOR

02:57:02.245 --> 02:57:06.883 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:57:04.414 --> 02:57:10.854 region:rollup2
BUT TO THINK ABOUT AS THE

02:57:06.883 --> 02:57:14.591 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF SELF GOVERNANCE I WAS

02:57:10.854 --> 02:57:19.896 region:rollup2
FASCINATED BY AND HOPE. THAT WE

02:57:14.591 --> 02:57:20.396 region:rollup2
CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT AS

02:57:19.896 --> 02:57:20.997 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS.

02:57:20.396 --> 02:57:21.831 region:rollup2
AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:22.899 region:rollup2
NEED FOR US AS. A CAPITAL

02:57:21.831 --> 02:57:23.333 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TO BE AWARE OF OUR OWN

02:57:22.899 --> 02:57:24.133 region:rollup2
BIASES.

02:57:23.333 --> 02:57:24.734 region:rollup2
IN THIS CONTEXT OF THIS

02:57:24.133 --> 02:57:25.835 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WE'VE TALKED WE'VE

02:57:24.734 --> 02:57:26.870 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD LINEAR CONVERSATIONS.

02:57:25.835 --> 02:57:27.070 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE POWER OVER

02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:31.074 region:rollup2
STAFF.

02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:32.609 region:rollup2
SUPERSTAR HARASSER WHO CAN BE

02:57:31.074 --> 02:57:35.712 region:rollup2
STAFF YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A TERM

02:57:32.609 --> 02:57:37.780 region:rollup2
LIMIT ENVIRONMENT AND STAFF WHO

02:57:35.712 --> 02:57:40.783 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT LONGER TEN YEARS

02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:43.753 region:rollup2
DIDN'T MEMBERS WHO.

02:57:40.783 --> 02:57:45.655 region:rollup2
CAN BEHAVE IN A DISRESPECTFUL

02:57:43.753 --> 02:57:47.991 region:rollup2
WAY THE OTHER WAY AND SO IT'S

02:57:45.655 --> 02:57:49.726 region:rollup2
NOT LINEAR IT GOES UP AND DOWN

02:57:47.991 --> 02:57:51.160 region:rollup2
IN IT AND CROSSWAYS. ANSEL

02:57:49.726 --> 02:57:53.796 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT HOW WE DEVELOP A

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:56.065 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE

02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:59.469 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF POWER I THINK IS

02:57:56.065 --> 02:58:00.036 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT. THE EXAMPLE

02:57:59.469 --> 02:58:01.070 region:rollup2
YOU GAVE FOR THE SHADOW OF A

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:01.738 region:rollup2
LEADER.

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:04.440 region:rollup2
AND.

02:58:01.738 --> 02:58:08.044 region:rollup2
AS I HAD A SIDE BAR WITH MY

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:10.213 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ON THAT ONLY DID.

02:58:08.044 --> 02:58:12.916 region:rollup2
THE LEADER OR NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:58:10.213 --> 02:58:13.983 region:rollup2
OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND. AND

02:58:12.916 --> 02:58:16.286 region:rollup2
CHECKED THE BEHAVIOR IN REAL

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:18.054 region:rollup2
TIME AS YOU WE AS PARENTS

02:58:16.286 --> 02:58:19.856 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WAIT TO GET

02:58:18.054 --> 02:58:22.058 region:rollup2
HOME FROM TARGET WHEN THE BIG

02:58:19.856 --> 02:58:23.359 region:rollup2
HATE WHEN YOU FILL OUT BY ALL.

02:58:22.058 --> 02:58:24.761 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A TEMPER TANTRUM TARGET

02:58:23.359 --> 02:58:26.896 region:rollup2
WHY DON'T WAIT TILL I GET HOME

02:58:24.761 --> 02:58:29.065 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION I LEVEL

02:58:26.896 --> 02:58:29.599 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE ON THE ISLAND TARGET

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:32.001 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHY YOUR BEHAVIOR IS

02:58:29.599 --> 02:58:33.236 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE. THAT DOESN'T IN

02:58:32.001 --> 02:58:35.004 region:rollup2
THE MOMENT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE.

02:58:33.236 --> 02:58:36.973 region:rollup2
AS WE GET OLDER.

02:58:35.004 --> 02:58:39.909 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WONDER

02:58:36.973 --> 02:58:41.344 region:rollup2
IF HE IS REPRIMAND OF OF THE

02:58:39.909 --> 02:58:43.146 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IF

02:58:41.344 --> 02:58:46.449 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED THE

02:58:43.146 --> 02:58:48.218 region:rollup2
CONCERN AT ALL. ALL RIGHT I MEAN

RIGHT ANY ONE IN THAT ROOM COULD

02:59:19.182 --> 02:59:24.954 region:rollup2
HAVE STOOD UP WALKED OUT. WALKED

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:26.823 region:rollup2
OVER TO THE THE PERSON WHO WAS

THE RECIPIENT OF THE HARM AND SO

02:59:26.823 --> 02:59:30.260 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP

02:59:28.257 --> 02:59:31.427 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE TITLE.

02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:33.463 region:rollup2

02:59:33.997 --> 02:59:36.799 region:rollup2
THING.

02:59:35.264 --> 02:59:39.202 region:rollup2
THAT ANYBODY IN THAT ROOM COULD

02:59:36.799 --> 02:59:41.604 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN OF ACTION. THAT COULD

02:59:39.202 --> 02:59:45.842 region:rollup2

PREPARED FROM IS WISE BUT IT'S

02:59:54.283 --> 02:59:57.920 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S

02:59:55.284 --> 02:59:59.589 region:rollup2
ALMOST HARD TO ASK THEM GIVEN.

02:59:57.920 --> 03:00:00.857 region:rollup2
THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE.

02:59:59.589 --> 03:00:03.192 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS IS SO

03:00:00.857 --> 03:00:05.395 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH THAT

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:08.398 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. OF SORT OF

03:00:05.395 --> 03:00:10.667 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING AND THEN YOU KNOW

03:00:08.398 --> 03:00:12.301 region:rollup2
DETERMINING SOME KIND OF PENALTY

03:00:10.667 --> 03:00:13.202 region:rollup2
OR COUNSELING OR WHATEVER IT IS

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:14.737 region:rollup2
SO.

03:00:13.202 --> 03:00:17.040 region:rollup2
AFTER HEARING.

03:00:14.737 --> 03:00:18.374 region:rollup2
HEARING ABOUT RESTORATIVE

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.076 region:rollup2

03:00:22.712 --> 03:00:25.081 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY YOU WOULD EACH

ANSWER THEM SO I'LL ASK THEM AND

03:00:25.081 --> 03:00:27.817 region:rollup2
BOTH OF YOU CAN CERTAINLY.

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:30.753 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

03:00:27.817 --> 03:00:32.555 region:rollup2
FIRST IS WHETHER IT IS

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:34.257 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE TO GIVE A COMPLAINT

03:00:32.555 --> 03:00:35.325 region:rollup2
IN THE OPTION IN THE COMPLAINT

03:00:34.257 --> 03:00:37.460 region:rollup2
AND THE OPTION OF CONFRONTING

03:00:35.325 --> 03:00:38.394 region:rollup2
THE HARASSER. WHAT DO YOU THINK

03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:39.762 region:rollup2
IN THE TRADITIONAL MODEL AND I

03:00:38.394 --> 03:00:40.630 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR

03:00:39.762 --> 03:00:42.332 region:rollup2
AGAIN THEY WERE SORT OF JUSTICE

03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:43.933 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT?

03:00:42.332 --> 03:00:46.436 region:rollup2
IS TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION BUT

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:48.438 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW GIVEN MORE

03:00:46.436 --> 03:00:49.939 region:rollup2
TYPICAL PROCESS WHAT WOULD YOU

03:00:48.438 --> 03:00:51.407 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

03:00:49.939 --> 03:00:53.309 region:rollup2
RIGHT ACTUALLY IN THAT THAT'S

03:00:51.407 --> 03:00:56.546 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED AS AN ASSESSMENT

03:00:53.309 --> 03:01:00.016 region:rollup2
TOOL AS WELL BY A GOOD.

03:00:56.546 --> 03:01:03.219 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR YOU MIGHT ASK IS

03:01:00.016 --> 03:01:06.022 region:rollup2
PART OF KIND OF THE INTAKE

03:01:03.219 --> 03:01:09.258 region:rollup2
PROCESS. YOU MIGHT ASK IF THE

03:01:06.022 --> 03:01:12.395 region:rollup2
PERSON HAS CONFRONTED THE PERSON

03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:14.097 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ACCUSING WHICH GIVES YOU

03:01:12.395 --> 03:01:17.200 region:rollup2
KIND OF A SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE

03:01:14.097 --> 03:01:17.667 region:rollup2
FEELING ABOUT IT HOW THEY'RE

03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:22.805 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

03:01:17.667 --> 03:01:24.373 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING THE SITUATION.

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:28.277 region:rollup2
THEY COULD THERE THEY CAN HAVE

03:01:24.373 --> 03:01:33.082 region:rollup2
EXTREME REACTIONS THEY CAN SAY

03:01:28.277 --> 03:01:33.649 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND NO I I

03:01:33.082 --> 03:01:34.283 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT.

03:01:33.649 --> 03:01:35.151 region:rollup2
OR FIRED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING.

03:01:34.283 --> 03:01:35.785 region:rollup2
THEY COULD SAY WELL YES I HAVE

03:01:35.151 --> 03:01:36.386 region:rollup2
I'VE DONE THAT OVER AND OVER

03:01:35.785 --> 03:01:36.986 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND I'M GETTING TO WORK

03:01:36.386 --> 03:01:37.854 region:rollup2
KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE OF

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:38.421 region:rollup2
PLACE. FOR WHERE THEY ARE.

03:01:37.854 --> 03:01:39.055 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

03:01:38.421 --> 03:01:39.722 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

03:01:39.055 --> 03:01:40.289 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THIS IS OFTEN BASED ON

03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:43.860 region:rollup2
THIS UNDERSTANDING RIGHT SO

03:01:40.289 --> 03:01:45.928 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE

03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:48.464 region:rollup2
A FULL BLOWN INVESTIGATION WHERE

03:01:45.928 --> 03:01:50.299 region:rollup2
IF THE PARTIES ARE AMENABLE ON.

03:01:48.464 --> 03:01:52.235 region:rollup2
WHAT YOUHAVE TO MAKE CLEAR FROM

03:01:50.299 --> 03:01:54.637 region:rollup2
A LEGAL STANDPOINT IS THAT IS

03:01:52.235 --> 03:01:58.174 region:rollup2
NEVER EVER THE COMPLAINING PARTY

03:01:54.637 --> 03:01:59.942 region:rollup2
IS RESPONSIBILITY TO IN ANY WAY

03:01:58.174 --> 03:02:01.344 region:rollup2
CONFRONT THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE

03:01:59.942 --> 03:02:02.845 region:rollup2
ACCUSING? SO WHETHER IT'S

03:02:01.344 --> 03:02:04.614 region:rollup2
THROUGH RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

03:02:02.845 --> 03:02:06.382 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT HAVE SOME APPEAL

03:02:04.614 --> 03:02:07.917 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU CAN BE VERY EMPOWERING

03:02:06.382 --> 03:02:09.719 region:rollup2
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSING.

03:02:07.917 --> 03:02:13.156 region:rollup2
FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT WE CAN

03:02:09.719 --> 03:02:15.525 region:rollup2
NEVER EVER REQUIRE THE PERSON TO

03:02:13.156 --> 03:02:17.627 region:rollup2
CONFRONT THEM BOMB DIRECTLY SO

03:02:15.525 --> 03:02:19.762 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO BE MADE VERY VERY

03:02:17.627 --> 03:02:21.364 region:rollup2
CLEAR AND THEN ONCE THAT'S VERY

03:02:19.762 --> 03:02:23.065 region:rollup2
CLEAR TO THEM IT'S HELPFUL TO

03:02:21.364 --> 03:02:24.867 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT

03:02:23.065 --> 03:02:26.202 region:rollup2
THAT WHETHER THEY'VE DONE THAT

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:28.671 region:rollup2
AT ALL. I'M I'M CERTAINLY MORE

03:02:26.202 --> 03:02:30.440 region:rollup2
CONCERNED IF THEY HAVE TOLD THE

03:02:28.671 --> 03:02:33.142 region:rollup2
PERSON SEVERAL TIMES THE

03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:34.277 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IS OFFENSIVE TO ME

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:36.612 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THE PERSON HAS

03:02:34.277 --> 03:02:38.448 region:rollup2
DISREGARDED THAT I'M ALREADY

03:02:36.612 --> 03:02:41.317 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY.

03:02:38.448 --> 03:02:43.820 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE UNWILLING TO DO THAT

03:02:41.317 --> 03:02:44.720 region:rollup2
I WANT TO KNOW THAT TOO.

03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:44.987 region:rollup2
I'M A MAN SO IT'S IT'S JUST

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:46.355 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:47.924 region:rollup2
IN STARTING WHATEVER THE

03:02:46.355 --> 03:02:49.625 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS GOING TO BE AND THEN

03:02:47.924 --> 03:02:51.694 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE OPEN TO IT AND IF

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:53.362 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED

03:02:51.694 --> 03:02:54.831 region:rollup2
IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THAT'S.

03:02:53.362 --> 03:02:56.365 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE CAN

03:02:54.831 --> 03:02:58.034 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SO I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:02:56.365 --> 03:02:59.235 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DIE I CERTAINLY

03:02:58.034 --> 03:03:00.937 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK YOU WOULD EVER

03:02:59.235 --> 03:03:02.605 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO GO ALL ONE WAY OR

03:03:00.937 --> 03:03:03.606 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL I

03:03:02.605 --> 03:03:05.341 region:rollup2
THINK TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:03:03.606 --> 03:03:06.576 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

03:03:05.341 --> 03:03:08.344 region:rollup2
AND THAT. THAT COULD BE AN

03:03:06.576 --> 03:03:09.745 region:rollup2
OPTION FOR PEOPLE IN THAT

03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:11.380 region:rollup2
SITUATION BUT YOU CAN NEVER

03:03:09.745 --> 03:03:12.782 region:rollup2
FORCE THAT AND AND YOU WOULDN'T

03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:14.283 region:rollup2
WANT TO ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT'S

03:03:12.782 --> 03:03:15.718 region:rollup2
NOT PART OF THE PROCESS. WHAT

03:03:14.283 --> 03:03:17.220 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE A WONDERFUL OPTION

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:19.088 region:rollup2
TO HAVE I PERSONALLY AM THE

03:03:17.220 --> 03:03:20.690 region:rollup2
MENTION VERY EXCITED TO THINK

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:23.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AS AN

03:03:20.690 --> 03:03:24.794 region:rollup2
OPTION? MOM BUT YOU COULD NEVER

03:03:23.759 --> 03:03:27.230 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THAT.

03:03:24.794 --> 03:03:28.497 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:30.099 region:rollup2
POLICY PERMITS EITHER THE

03:03:28.497 --> 03:03:32.001 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT NOR THE RESPONDENT TO

03:03:30.099 --> 03:03:34.003 region:rollup2
APPEAL THE DECISION DO YOU THINK

03:03:32.001 --> 03:03:37.173 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE NO NO

03:03:34.003 --> 03:03:39.709 region:rollup2
NO.

03:03:37.173 --> 03:03:39.876 region:rollup2
I KNOW I DON'T I FEEL THAT THAT

03:03:39.709 --> 03:03:41.577 region:rollup2
IS.

03:03:39.876 --> 03:03:44.213 region:rollup2
.

03:03:41.577 --> 03:03:45.281 region:rollup2
I BACKING UP. WHEN YOU HAVE AN

03:03:44.213 --> 03:03:46.616 region:rollup2
AGAIN I AM THE INTERNAL

03:03:45.281 --> 03:03:49.118 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR LET'S SAY WHO IS

03:03:46.616 --> 03:03:51.420 region:rollup2
WELL TRAINED. WHO'S GETTING

03:03:49.118 --> 03:03:53.456 region:rollup2
TRAINING ONTINUALLY THEY NEED

03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:55.858 region:rollup2
TO THEY MUST THEIR DUTY YOUR

03:03:53.456 --> 03:03:59.428 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONDUCT

03:03:55.858 --> 03:04:01.497 region:rollup2
THAT PROMPT IMPARTIAL THOROUGH.

03:03:59.428 --> 03:04:03.532 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:05.768 region:rollup2
THE LAST PANEL I I'M JUST SAYING

03:04:03.532 --> 03:04:07.770 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SAID RIGHT THAT'S THEY

03:04:05.768 --> 03:04:09.038 region:rollup2
THEY. THEY WILL OUTLINED IT

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:11.274 region:rollup2
OTHERS NO REASON TO REPEAT WHAT

03:04:09.038 --> 03:04:12.575 region:rollup2
THEY SAID WAS EXCELLENT SO YOU

03:04:11.274 --> 03:04:14.510 region:rollup2
YOU WANT THE INVESTIGATION TO

03:04:12.575 --> 03:04:17.547 region:rollup2
PROCEED THAT WAY IF THEY'VE DONE

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:18.781 region:rollup2
THAT ONCE THEY FINISHED. THAT'S

03:04:17.547 --> 03:04:20.917 region:rollup2
THE RESULT.

03:04:18.781 --> 03:04:22.251 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IT WOULD TAKE AWAY

03:04:20.917 --> 03:04:25.521 region:rollup2
ANY AUTHORITY ANY.

03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:26.923 region:rollup2
YOU'D BE QUESTIONING THEIR

03:04:25.521 --> 03:04:27.957 region:rollup2
PROCESS THEIR PROCEDURE THEIR

03:04:26.923 --> 03:04:29.992 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CONDUCT

03:04:27.957 --> 03:04:31.694 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS TO ALLOW SOMEONE

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:33.396 region:rollup2
TO SAY I APPEAL BECAUSE WHAT

03:04:31.694 --> 03:04:34.597 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SAYING IS I DON'T AGREE

03:04:33.396 --> 03:04:36.732 region:rollup2
WITH THE RESULT.

03:04:34.597 --> 03:04:38.434 region:rollup2
SO YOU'VE JUST SAID THAT ENTIRE

03:04:36.732 --> 03:04:41.237 region:rollup2
PROCESS ALL THE EFFORT THAT YOU

03:04:38.434 --> 03:04:42.538 region:rollup2
PUT INTO THAT ALL THE RESOURCES.

03:04:41.237 --> 03:04:43.406 region:rollup2
YOU WE JUST WANT TO DISREGARD

03:04:42.538 --> 03:04:44.373 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE

03:04:43.406 --> 03:04:45.808 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT'S ALL THAT'S

03:04:44.373 --> 03:04:47.343 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

03:04:45.808 --> 03:04:49.211 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THERE'S NO THEY HAVE

03:04:47.343 --> 03:04:51.380 region:rollup2
NO RIGHT OF APPEAL UNLESS YOU

03:04:49.211 --> 03:04:52.014 region:rollup2
GIVE THAT TO THEM.

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:54.383 region:rollup2
AND I I JUST THINK THAT WOULD

03:04:52.014 --> 03:04:55.484 region:rollup2
BE A. MIS USE OF RESOURCES AND

03:04:54.383 --> 03:04:56.819 region:rollup2
IT REALLY JUST CALLS INTO

03:04:55.484 --> 03:04:57.386 region:rollup2
QUESTION EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE

03:04:56.819 --> 03:04:59.221 region:rollup2
DONE RIGHT AND WE DO DO THAT

03:04:57.386 --> 03:05:04.060 region:rollup2
NOW.

03:04:59.221 --> 03:05:05.962 region:rollup2
.

03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:07.596 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IS A

03:05:05.962 --> 03:05:09.532 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP ON THAT THOSE WHO.

03:05:07.596 --> 03:05:10.766 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY THOSE

03:05:09.532 --> 03:05:12.001 region:rollup2
TO DO THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:13.569 region:rollup2
PAID BY THE STATE AND SO IF YOU

03:05:12.001 --> 03:05:15.071 region:rollup2
HAVE.

03:05:13.569 --> 03:05:17.773 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION THAT COMES OUT

03:05:15.071 --> 03:05:19.709 region:rollup2
IN A IN A MANNER THAT TOM.

03:05:17.773 --> 03:05:21.844 region:rollup2
IS IT SATISFACTORY TO WHO'S

03:05:19.709 --> 03:05:23.179 region:rollup2
BEING ACCUSED AND THEY THEY SAY

03:05:21.844 --> 03:05:24.747 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE A BIAS THERE HOW

03:05:23.179 --> 03:05:28.517 region:rollup2
DO YOU KEEP THAT FROM BEING A

03:05:24.747 --> 03:05:30.219 region:rollup2
BIAS WHEN YOU HAVE. THE THE.

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:32.955 region:rollup2
PARTY THIS BEING EMPLOYED. IS

03:05:30.219 --> 03:05:34.724 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED BY THE STATE WILL

03:05:32.955 --> 03:05:36.392 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S EMPLOYED RATE THE

03:05:34.724 --> 03:05:38.694 region:rollup2
PERSON WHOSE ACCUSING IS IT

03:05:36.392 --> 03:05:41.030 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED BY THE STATE AS WELL.

03:05:38.694 --> 03:05:42.365 region:rollup2
AND THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED.

03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:43.399 region:rollup2
IS EMPLOYED BY THE STATE SO

03:05:42.365 --> 03:05:46.335 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS WITH AN INTERNAL

03:05:43.399 --> 03:05:47.970 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR AND THAT'S PART OF.

03:05:46.335 --> 03:05:49.805 region:rollup2
THE GOOD INVESTIGATION I MEAN

03:05:47.970 --> 03:05:52.908 region:rollup2
THEY THEY HAVE TO BE MINDFUL AND

03:05:49.805 --> 03:05:52.908 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK AS THE PANEL

03:05:52.975 --> 03:05:56.612 region:rollup2
FRIENDSHIP OR RELATIONSHIP. THAN

03:05:54.977 --> 03:05:58.581 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON THEY CAN'T DO THE

03:05:56.612 --> 03:05:59.915 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION SO DEPENDING ON

03:05:58.581 --> 03:06:02.385 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE WHO ARE

03:05:59.915 --> 03:06:03.653 region:rollup2
WELL TRAINED IN INVESTIGATION.

03:06:02.385 --> 03:06:05.087 region:rollup2
IT'S EITHER SIGN TO ANOTHER

03:06:03.653 --> 03:06:05.621 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR OR YOU YOU WOULD

03:06:05.087 --> 03:06:06.255 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE IF YOU

03:06:05.621 --> 03:06:08.758 region:rollup2
DON'T-HAVE OTHERS INTERNALLY BUT

03:06:06.255 --> 03:06:11.360 region:rollup2
THAT

03:06:08.758 --> 03:06:13.095 region:rollup2
MEANS RECOGNIZING THAT BIAS.

03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:14.263 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE GOT SAY WILL ONLY ONE

03:06:13.095 --> 03:06:16.465 region:rollup2
PERSON AND THEN THEY HAVE A

03:06:14.263 --> 03:06:17.099 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE

03:06:16.465 --> 03:06:19.769 region:rollup2
PARTIES.

03:06:17.099 --> 03:06:21.137 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO REPORT THAT AND

03:06:19.769 --> 03:06:22.571 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T DO THE INVESTIGATION

03:06:21.137 --> 03:06:24.006 region:rollup2
AND AND THE BIAS MIGHT BE IN THE

03:06:22.571 --> 03:06:25.841 region:rollup2
VICTIM MAY BE UNHAPPY WITH THE

03:06:24.006 --> 03:06:27.309 region:rollup2
RESULT. MEAN THEY COULD WELL BE

03:06:25.841 --> 03:06:29.245 region:rollup2
THE ONE SAYING NO I WANT TO FEEL

03:06:27.309 --> 03:06:31.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE RESULTS

03:06:29.245 --> 03:06:33.849 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PERSON

03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:36.786 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOT. IT GOES EITHER WAY

03:06:33.849 --> 03:06:38.688 region:rollup2
RIGHT RIGHT BUT NO I'M SAYING

03:06:36.786 --> 03:06:40.456 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE SAYING I

03:06:38.688 --> 03:06:42.692 region:rollup2
DON'T LIKE YOU KNOW ACROSS

03:06:40.456 --> 03:06:45.327 region:rollup2
PROCESS BY EITHER SIDE. RIGHT

03:06:42.692 --> 03:06:48.531 region:rollup2
NOT IF YOU'VE GOT WELL TRAINED

03:06:45.327 --> 03:06:51.133 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS THAT COULD THAT'S

03:06:48.531 --> 03:06:55.738 region:rollup2
JUST DOING IT AGAIN. AND THEN

03:06:51.133 --> 03:06:56.372 region:rollup2
AND THEN. AND THEN WHY WOULDN'T

03:06:55.738 --> 03:06:57.239 region:rollup2
YOU JUST ALLOW ANOTHER APPEAL.

03:06:56.372 --> 03:06:58.074 region:rollup2
IF IT COMES OUT THE OTHER WAY.

03:06:57.239 --> 03:06:59.208 region:rollup2
SO I. DISAGREE WITH YOU WE ARE

03:06:58.074 --> 03:06:59.809 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE NOT IN LINE WITH

03:06:59.208 --> 03:07:00.443 region:rollup2
THAT THOUGHT PROCESS RIGHT AND

03:06:59.809 --> 03:07:01.243 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND I I WOULD ECHO WHAT

03:07:00.443 --> 03:07:01.811 region:rollup2
THE PANEL SAID AS WELL I DON'T

03:07:01.243 --> 03:07:02.445 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE. WHAT I JUST

03:07:01.811 --> 03:07:02.978 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE ONE MORE POINT ABOUT

03:07:02.445 --> 03:07:04.580 region:rollup2
THE ZERO TOLERANCE AND I'M

03:07:02.978 --> 03:07:05.614 region:rollup2
SPEAKING OUT OF TURN I KNOW

03:07:04.580 --> 03:07:07.349 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NO ONE ASKED?

03:07:05.614 --> 03:07:08.918 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION SO

03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:10.686 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PERFECTLY UNDER ON TOPIC

03:07:08.918 --> 03:07:12.121 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU I AM DIED THE

03:07:10.686 --> 03:07:15.391 region:rollup2
OTHER PANEL I AGREE ALSO THE

03:07:12.121 --> 03:07:16.992 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE. IS CONFUSING TO

03:07:15.391 --> 03:07:18.260 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BECAUSE. IT'S

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:19.361 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTOOD THE OTHER THING

03:07:18.260 --> 03:07:22.531 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH A ZERO

03:07:19.361 --> 03:07:24.700 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE POLICY IS IT TENDS TO.

03:07:22.531 --> 03:07:26.102 region:rollup2
ALSO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM

03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:28.204 region:rollup2
REPORTING HARASSMENT BECAUSE OF

03:07:26.102 --> 03:07:30.039 region:rollup2
DAMOS UNDERSTAND IT TOO AND SO

03:07:28.204 --> 03:07:30.606 region:rollup2
OFTEN SOMEONE WHO FEELS THAT

03:07:30.039 --> 03:07:33.509 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

03:07:30.606 --> 03:07:34.844 region:rollup2
BEEN THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT.

03:07:33.509 --> 03:07:37.179 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT

03:07:34.844 --> 03:07:40.216 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR JOB. THEY

03:07:37.179 --> 03:07:41.016 region:rollup2
WANT THE BEHAVIOR TO STOP. THEY

03:07:40.216 --> 03:07:42.651 region:rollup2
WANT TO PRESERVE THE

03:07:41.016 --> 03:07:44.653 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND

03:07:42.651 --> 03:07:46.922 region:rollup2
THEY JUST WANT THE BEHAVIOR TO

03:07:44.653 --> 03:07:48.491 region:rollup2
STOP SO IF THERE MISINTERPRETING

03:07:46.922 --> 03:07:50.493 region:rollup2
THE POLICY AS WELL AND BEGIN A

03:07:48.491 --> 03:07:52.461 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE MEANS THIS PERSON

03:07:50.493 --> 03:07:53.896 region:rollup2
WILL POTENTIALLY LOSE THEIR JOB.

03:07:52.461 --> 03:07:55.531 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NOT REPORT AND WE

03:07:53.896 --> 03:07:58.400 region:rollup2
ALREADY KNOW THAT HARASSMENT IS

03:07:55.531 --> 03:08:00.169 region:rollup2
SO GROSSLY UNDER REPORTED THAT

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:03.139 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING WE NEED IS THE

03:08:00.169 --> 03:08:05.174 region:rollup2
POLICY ITSELF. ON MAKING IT MORE

03:08:03.139 --> 03:08:06.108 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT

03:08:05.174 --> 03:08:09.879 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY TO THAT.

03:08:06.108 --> 03:08:12.648 region:rollup2
YOUR POLICY YOU KNOW I SAID THE

03:08:09.879 --> 03:08:14.316 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE SUGGESTED EVERYONE'S

03:08:12.648 --> 03:08:17.219 region:rollup2
POLICY WHICH IS PERFECTLY

03:08:14.316 --> 03:08:18.621 region:rollup2
LEGALLY COMPLIANT CAN BE BETTER

03:08:17.219 --> 03:08:22.992 region:rollup2
YOUR POLICY SHOULD BE VERY

03:08:18.621 --> 03:08:25.928 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO YOUR WORK PLACE. SO

03:08:22.992 --> 03:08:28.364 region:rollup2
I CAN READ THIRTY I I'VE BEEN IN

03:08:25.928 --> 03:08:30.466 region:rollup2
PRACTICE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I

03:08:28.364 --> 03:08:33.435 region:rollup2
CAN PUT THIRTY EMPLOYERS

03:08:30.466 --> 03:08:40.342 region:rollup2
POLICIES TOGETHER AND THEY'RE SO

03:08:33.435 --> 03:08:40.676 region:rollup2
SIMILAR. ARM AND THEY SHOULDN'T

03:08:40.342 --> 03:08:41.343 region:rollup2
BE THAT WAY.

03:08:40.676 --> 03:08:41.944 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY THEY SHOULD SHARE

03:08:41.343 --> 03:08:42.611 region:rollup2
SOME CHARACTERISTICS BUT THEY

03:08:41.944 --> 03:08:43.179 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE VERY SPECIFIC TO YOUR

03:08:42.611 --> 03:08:43.746 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THEY SHOULD HAVE

03:08:43.179 --> 03:08:44.380 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THE PEOPLE IN YOUR

03:08:43.746 --> 03:08:45.214 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CAN PICK UP AND SAY.

03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:46.048 region:rollup2
YUP. YUP THAT COULD HAPPEN I

03:08:45.214 --> 03:08:47.616 region:rollup2
COULD SEE I COULD SEE THOSE THAT

03:08:46.048 --> 03:08:48.651 region:rollup2
SITUATION IN IN MY WORKPLACE SO.

03:08:47.616 --> 03:08:49.785 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF

03:08:48.651 --> 03:08:51.620 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT THAT EVERY EMPLOYER

03:08:49.785 --> 03:08:53.823 region:rollup2
COULD MAKE.

03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:54.490 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE AN

03:08:53.823 --> 03:08:57.760 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS.

03:08:54.490 --> 03:08:58.327 region:rollup2
THE WAY NOW THAT PEOPLE CAN

03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:00.529 region:rollup2
GIVE US SUGGESTIONS TO THIS

03:08:58.327 --> 03:09:02.164 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. AND SUGGEST THINGS

03:09:00.529 --> 03:09:02.832 region:rollup2
FOR US TO THINK ABOUT AND LOOK

03:09:02.164 --> 03:09:04.567 region:rollup2
AT.

03:09:02.832 --> 03:09:06.168 region:rollup2
FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ARE YOU

03:09:04.567 --> 03:09:06.869 region:rollup2
KNOW RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD

03:09:06.168 --> 03:09:08.337 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GONNA HAVE

03:09:06.869 --> 03:09:09.805 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENTARY HERE IN A FEW

03:09:08.337 --> 03:09:10.472 region:rollup2
MINUTES AND PEOPLE CAN GET UP

03:09:09.805 --> 03:09:12.208 region:rollup2
AND SPEAK TO SOME PEOPLE RATHER

03:09:10.472 --> 03:09:13.676 region:rollup2
DO IT ANONYMOUSLY. AND ONE OF

03:09:12.208 --> 03:09:15.411 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GOT ONE OF

03:09:13.676 --> 03:09:17.379 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS WE GOT WAS ABOUT

03:09:15.411 --> 03:09:18.480 region:rollup2
THE THE USE OF ALCOHOL. BOTH

03:09:17.379 --> 03:09:20.015 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IN THE BUILDING AFTER

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:21.483 region:rollup2
HOURS AND SOMETIMES OUTSIDE I'M

03:09:20.015 --> 03:09:22.818 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOU EITHER YOU HAVE

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:24.720 region:rollup2
A SENSE OF HOW ALCOHOL

03:09:22.818 --> 03:09:26.288 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTES TO ANY OF THIS OR IS

03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:28.190 region:rollup2
THAT A RED HERRING WHERE IF WE

03:09:26.288 --> 03:09:29.959 region:rollup2
HAD A BETTER CULTURE. THAN

03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:30.659 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL WOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW.

03:09:29.959 --> 03:09:32.528 region:rollup2
THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:34.863 region:rollup2
POINTING AT YEAH IT'S AS I SAID

03:09:32.528 --> 03:09:36.465 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A DEFINITE RISK FACTOR

03:09:34.863 --> 03:09:37.066 region:rollup2
AT ABSOLUTELY IT'S A RISK FACTOR

03:09:36.465 --> 03:09:39.168 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT HAS TO BE PART

03:09:37.066 --> 03:09:40.669 region:rollup2
OF.

03:09:39.168 --> 03:09:43.038 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT DO WE

03:09:40.669 --> 03:09:45.241 region:rollup2
WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE.

03:09:43.038 --> 03:09:46.609 region:rollup2
SO YOU COULD CHOOSE TO KEEP IT

03:09:45.241 --> 03:09:48.043 region:rollup2
JUST AS IT IS AND I DON'T KNOW

03:09:46.609 --> 03:09:50.346 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT OBVIOUSLY

03:09:48.043 --> 03:09:52.281 region:rollup2
THERE IS. ALCOHOL AVAILABLE AT

03:09:50.346 --> 03:09:53.816 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TIMES AND EVENTS AND YOU

03:09:52.281 --> 03:09:56.051 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP IT THAT WAY.

03:09:53.816 --> 03:09:59.321 region:rollup2
AND THEN I GUESS OVERLAY A

03:09:56.051 --> 03:10:01.190 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY RESPECTFUL OF.

03:09:59.321 --> 03:10:02.691 region:rollup2
CIVIL CULTURE I THINK WHAT YOU

03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:04.493 region:rollup2
SAID AT THE END OF THE LAST

03:10:02.691 --> 03:10:06.462 region:rollup2
PANEL WAS SO I THINK WE SHOULD

03:10:04.493 --> 03:10:08.163 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL JUST SAID.

03:10:06.462 --> 03:10:09.665 region:rollup2
A MAN AND WALKED OUT BECAUSE.

03:10:08.163 --> 03:10:11.233 region:rollup2
YOU SAID IF YOU'VE GOT A YOU

03:10:09.665 --> 03:10:13.002 region:rollup2
KNOW A CULTURE OF CIVILITY AND

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:14.870 region:rollup2
RESPECT YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH

03:10:13.002 --> 03:10:16.372 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND I THINK THAT TRULY

03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:18.107 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD ANY EMPLOYER COULD

03:10:16.372 --> 03:10:18.907 region:rollup2
DO THAT THEY'VE SOLVED THE

03:10:18.107 --> 03:10:20.809 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

03:10:18.907 --> 03:10:22.278 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE FURTHER YOU GO

03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:23.913 region:rollup2
IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW

03:10:22.278 --> 03:10:25.748 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT TEMPERS A PROBLEM

03:10:23.913 --> 03:10:28.450 region:rollup2
WITH ALCOHOL BUT ALCOHOL DOES

03:10:25.748 --> 03:10:29.084 region:rollup2
IMPAIR JUDGMENT. AND SO AND

03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:31.854 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH THE YOUNG WORK

03:10:29.084 --> 03:10:35.024 region:rollup2
FORCE. MEAN THAT'S JUST THAT'S.

03:10:31.854 --> 03:10:36.692 region:rollup2
IT'S RISKY.

03:10:35.024 --> 03:10:37.993 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WOULD ADD THAT OF.

03:10:36.692 --> 03:10:40.362 region:rollup2
IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS WE SAY WE

03:10:37.993 --> 03:10:41.964 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THINGS TO PEOPLE WE DO

03:10:40.362 --> 03:10:43.299 region:rollup2
THINGS WITH PEOPLE.

03:10:41.964 --> 03:10:44.900 region:rollup2
SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT

03:10:43.299 --> 03:10:46.935 region:rollup2
DO WE WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE

03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:48.304 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

03:10:46.935 --> 03:10:50.272 region:rollup2
BE DECIDED BY SOMEONE ON TOP.

03:10:48.304 --> 03:10:52.141 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN IMPOSED ON EVERYBODY

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:54.810 region:rollup2
ELSE IF YOU WANT AN EFFECTIVE

03:10:52.141 --> 03:10:56.345 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'VE BEEN.

03:10:54.810 --> 03:10:58.914 region:rollup2
ASKED TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO

03:10:56.345 --> 03:11:01.183 region:rollup2
ASKED THE STAFF MEMBERS US. YOU

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:01.717 region:rollup2
KNOW AT THE JANITORS EVEN YOU

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:03.385 region:rollup2
KNOW.

03:11:01.717 --> 03:11:05.321 region:rollup2
AS THE FOOD SERVERS YOU HAVE

03:11:03.385 --> 03:11:07.723 region:rollup2
THEM SIT DOWN WITH THE LAWMAKERS

03:11:05.321 --> 03:11:08.557 region:rollup2
AND STAFF IN A CIRCLE WHAT DO WE

03:11:07.723 --> 03:11:10.326 region:rollup2
WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE YOU CAN

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:11.994 region:rollup2
HAVE A WONDERFUL CIRCLE

03:11:10.326 --> 03:11:13.228 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AROUND THAT. YOU CAN

03:11:11.994 --> 03:11:15.397 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A PLAN SOME

03:11:13.228 --> 03:11:17.533 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT GETTING IT

03:11:15.397 --> 03:11:19.668 region:rollup2
FROM THE PEOPLE OF YOU KNOW ON

03:11:17.533 --> 03:11:21.704 region:rollup2
THE GROUND IS IS REALLY REALLY I

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:22.304 region:rollup2
THINK IMPORTANT.

03:11:21.704 --> 03:11:24.039 region:rollup2
.

03:11:22.304 --> 03:11:25.040 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT TRANSFORMATIONAL

03:11:24.039 --> 03:11:26.742 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT WE REALLY WANT

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:27.876 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

03:11:26.742 --> 03:11:30.346 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE.

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:31.814 region:rollup2

WORKPLACE AND SOMETHING THAT'S

03:11:36.385 --> 03:11:40.122 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE. TO EVERYBODY BUT

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:42.458 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT A WORKPLACE

03:11:40.122 --> 03:11:43.826 region:rollup2
WHERE MEMBERS NEVER AND INTERACT

03:11:42.458 --> 03:11:45.894 region:rollup2
WITH STAFF SOCIALLY OR WHERE

03:11:43.826 --> 03:11:47.730 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T JUST

03:11:45.894 --> 03:11:49.064 region:rollup2
RELAX AND YOU KNOW YOU HEAR IT'S

03:11:47.730 --> 03:11:51.600 region:rollup2
KIND OF THAT LONG THAT PENDULUM

SHIFTING LINE. WE WANT THINGS TO

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:54.169 region:rollup2
BE BETTER BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT

03:11:53.035 --> 03:11:56.805 region:rollup2

DOWN THOSE BARRIERS BASED ON OUR

03:12:05.214 --> 03:12:08.684 region:rollup2
STATUS. A WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE

03:12:07.449 --> 03:12:10.452 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SITTING IN

03:12:13.489 --> 03:12:16.825 region:rollup2
CIRCLE DURING THE APPRECIATION

03:12:28.137 --> 03:12:38.447 region:rollup2
CIRCLE OF SO CREATING THOSE

03:12:32.074 --> 03:12:42.584 region:rollup2
SPACES WHERE OF. AUTHENTIC

03:12:38.447 --> 03:12:46.622 region:rollup2

.

03:12:58.267 --> 03:12:59.968 region:rollup2
SURE WE WE SAW A LETTER FROM A

03:12:59.101 --> 03:13:00.669 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY WOMEN.

03:12:59.968 --> 03:13:01.336 region:rollup2
ARE WE SAID ENOUGH AND I'M JUST

03:13:00.669 --> 03:13:01.837 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOUR PROCESS WOULD

03:13:01.336 --> 03:13:03.172 region:rollup2
BE HELPFUL.

03:13:01.837 --> 03:13:05.240 region:rollup2
.

03:13:03.172 --> 03:13:07.609 region:rollup2
YES I BELIEVE SO.

03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:09.678 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THOSE WOMEN ARE

03:13:07.609 --> 03:13:11.613 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVES TO

03:13:09.678 --> 03:13:13.282 region:rollup2
PUNITIVE APPROACH IN SO MANY

03:13:11.613 --> 03:13:15.050 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE FOR THE REASONS THAT

03:13:13.282 --> 03:13:17.352 region:rollup2
WERE STATED JUST EARLIER. ABOUT

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:18.821 region:rollup2
MY CO PANELISTS. ON.

03:13:17.352 --> 03:13:21.156 region:rollup2
AND LIKE THE WOMEN THE DOLL

03:13:18.821 --> 03:13:21.690 region:rollup2
HOUSE THE THEY WERE SAYING YOU

03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:22.324 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS IS A VERY SMALL

03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:24.426 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

03:13:22.324 --> 03:13:27.062 region:rollup2
I KNOW THESE GUYS YOU KNOW WHO

03:13:24.426 --> 03:13:28.564 region:rollup2
SAID THESE HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT

03:13:27.062 --> 03:13:29.164 region:rollup2
ME ON FACEBOOK. THEY'RE MY

03:13:28.564 --> 03:13:31.400 region:rollup2
FRIENDS YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT

03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:32.868 region:rollup2
TO.

03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:35.137 region:rollup2
THEM OUT OF DENTAL SCHOOL IN

03:13:32.868 --> 03:13:36.939 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREERS WILL BE. DESTROYED

03:13:35.137 --> 03:13:39.041 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT THAT FOR THEM YOU

03:13:36.939 --> 03:13:40.509 region:rollup2
KNOW I WANNA A RESTORATIVE

03:13:39.041 --> 03:13:42.678 region:rollup2

CAN REALLY LEARN.

03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:48.650 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IF THEY IF IF THE

03:13:46.482 --> 03:13:50.252 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHO SIGNED THAT LETTER ARE

03:13:48.650 --> 03:13:51.653 region:rollup2

03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:58.060 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF PROCESS COULD BE

03:13:57.493 --> 03:13:59.761 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU WHO

VICE CHAIRMAN JOHN.

03:14:01.930 --> 03:14:04.399 region:rollup2
I THINK TO YOUR EARLIER POINT

03:14:03.265 --> 03:14:07.236 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST UP TO THE WOMAN

03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:09.605 region:rollup2
WHO SIGNED THE LETTER BUT THOSE

03:14:07.236 --> 03:14:11.573 region:rollup2
WHO CAUSE THEM HARM. HAVING TO

03:14:09.605 --> 03:14:13.275 region:rollup2
BE WILLING TO STEP UP AND TAKE

03:14:11.573 --> 03:14:14.276 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND BE HELD

03:14:13.275 --> 03:14:16.712 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE TO ENGAGE WITH IS

03:14:14.276 --> 03:14:18.013 region:rollup2
NOT A ONE DIRECTIONL LINEAR

03:14:16.712 --> 03:14:20.382 region:rollup2
KIND OF PROCESS.

03:14:18.013 --> 03:14:21.850 region:rollup2
EVEN LISTENING TO YOU TALK

03:14:20.382 --> 03:14:23.552 region:rollup2
ABOUT NOT WHEN THE PENDULUM TO

SWING YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S

03:14:23.552 --> 03:14:26.989 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE HAVE A FRANK

03:14:25.254 --> 03:14:29.892 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT APPROPRIATE

03:14:26.989 --> 03:14:31.393 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF A WORKPLACE. WE

03:14:29.892 --> 03:14:33.228 region:rollup2

EMPLOYEES AND AND AND THEY'RE

03:14:33.228 --> 03:14:36.965 region:rollup2
PERHAPS NAIVELY TAY ABOUT WHAT

03:14:35.197 --> 03:14:38.500 region:rollup2
TO EXPECT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:40.702 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION I'M SITTING

A NEW BREED IT IN WORK RELATED

03:14:43.305 --> 03:14:46.508 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS IT I'M NOT COMPLAIN

03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:49.044 region:rollup2
THAT YOUNGER EMPLOYEES IT'S ON

03:14:46.508 --> 03:14:50.412 region:rollup2
UP THE SPECTRUM AGE SPECTRUM. OF

03:14:49.044 --> 03:14:52.214 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CAN SUPPORT AS WE TALK

03:14:50.412 --> 03:14:53.248 region:rollup2
ABOUT CULTURE SHIFT WE TALK

03:14:52.214 --> 03:14:54.983 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:14:53.248 --> 03:14:56.351 region:rollup2
AND A PERFECT EXPECTATION TO

03:14:54.983 --> 03:14:57.953 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE WORKPLACE I THINK IT

03:14:56.351 --> 03:14:59.955 region:rollup2
VARIES FROM MEMBERS OFFICE TO

03:14:57.953 --> 03:15:00.722 region:rollup2

OUTSIDE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT.

03:15:04.693 --> 03:15:10.699 region:rollup2
AND THERE WON'T BE ONE STRICT

03:15:07.796 --> 03:15:11.700 region:rollup2
KIND OF WAY IN WHICH.

03:15:10.699 --> 03:15:13.235 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAPPENS IT

03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:15.137 region:rollup2
VARIES BUT MEMBER TO MEMBER BUT

03:15:13.235 --> 03:15:17.239 region:rollup2

TALK ABOUT CULTURE* SHIFT TO

03:15:17.239 --> 03:15:20.142 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS IS A HIGH

03:15:17.773 --> 03:15:23.412 region:rollup2
STRESS.

03:15:20.142 --> 03:15:25.847 region:rollup2
DEADLINE DRIVEN.

DIFFERENT WAY. AND AFTER THAT

WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN

03:20:15.737 --> 03:20:20.609 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING ABOUT RESTORATIVE

03:20:17.239 --> 03:20:22.844 region:rollup2

WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED CENTERED.

03:20:33.989 --> 03:20:37.025 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD REALLY

03:20:35.257 --> 03:20:38.894 region:rollup2
ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE

03:20:37.025 --> 03:20:40.562 region:rollup2
BUILDING ABOUT THIS IF THEY WERE

IT.

03:20:46.334 --> 03:20:50.939 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT WHEN COMPLAINTS

ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE

SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DOES NOT RISE

03:20:57.579 --> 03:21:02.784 region:rollup2
TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A GREGIS.

03:21:00.582 --> 03:21:05.086 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT.

03:21:02.784 --> 03:21:06.354 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THAT BEHAVIOR IS

03:21:05.086 --> 03:21:09.858 region:rollup2
NEVER THE LESS.

03:21:06.354 --> 03:21:12.327 region:rollup2
OFFENSIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE AND

03:21:09.858 --> 03:21:14.529 region:rollup2

03:21:14.529 --> 03:21:18.700 region:rollup2
ENTERED THAT BEHAVIOR AT THAT.

03:21:16.531 --> 03:21:20.669 region:rollup2
WELL IF IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE

03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:21.569 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CRIMINAL SORRY THERE'S

03:21:20.669 --> 03:21:24.706 region:rollup2
REALLY NOTHING.

03:21:21.569 --> 03:21:26.942 region:rollup2

FIXING. THE BEHAVIOR.

03:21:36.251 --> 03:21:39.955 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT A RESTORATIVE

03:21:37.953 --> 03:21:41.556 region:rollup2
JUSTICE OPTION.

03:21:39.955 --> 03:21:45.393 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY.

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:47.295 region:rollup2
BE A WAY TO DEAL WITH SO MUCH

03:21:45.393 --> 03:21:49.164 region:rollup2
OF THIS BEHAVIOR THAT IS

03:21:47.295 --> 03:21:51.032 region:rollup2
OFFENSIVE AND APPROPRIATE SHOULD

03:21:49.164 --> 03:21:52.834 region:rollup2
NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT DOESN'T

03:21:51.032 --> 03:21:54.269 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF

03:21:52.834 --> 03:21:56.471 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

03:21:54.269 --> 03:21:58.173 region:rollup2
OUR BEHAVIOR AND WE REALLY THINK

03:21:56.471 --> 03:22:00.609 region:rollup2
IT IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION. I

03:21:58.173 --> 03:22:02.143 region:rollup2
CAN'T HELP BUT THINKING THAT.

03:22:00.609 --> 03:22:03.078 region:rollup2

ABOUT.

03:22:03.078 --> 03:22:08.283 region:rollup2

IF IT HAD BEEN CONFRONTED EARLY

03:22:08.283 --> 03:22:12.687 region:rollup2
ON UP.

03:22:10.518 --> 03:22:16.024 region:rollup2
THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE REACHED

03:22:12.687 --> 03:22:17.859 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL. OF OF BEING PERVASIVE

03:22:16.024 --> 03:22:19.361 region:rollup2
TO WEAR IT THEN BECOMES A A

03:22:17.859 --> 03:22:20.895 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

03:22:19.361 --> 03:22:22.397 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND.
