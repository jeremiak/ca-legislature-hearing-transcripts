ENOUGH FEBRUARY WAS CHOSEN VERY

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.833

THERE'S STILL NOT STILL BUT JUST

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:16.501
ARE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN

HARDER IN TERMS OF MORTALITY

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:36.722
THAN- THAN THEIR WHITE

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:39.825
COUNTERPARTS. AND THERE THE

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:51.236
LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:53.305
INCREASED FUNDING. TO LOOK

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.741
