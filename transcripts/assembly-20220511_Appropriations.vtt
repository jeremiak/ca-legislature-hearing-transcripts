ARE FINANCED LOOKED AT OUR

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.645
STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.247
TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM WERE

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.349
IDENTIFIED AS HAVING ZERO GROWTH

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.950
ARE ACTUALLY SHRINKING. YOU TEND

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.819
TO BE OUR MORE RURAL COUNTY. AND

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.021
WE IN THE STATE ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:55.190
LONG HISTORY. OF THE STATE LEVEL

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.159
CREATING TOOLS TO SUPPORT LOCAL

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.361
INITIATIVES IDENTIFY ISSUES YOU

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:02.264
WANT TO WORK ON THE NEED TO WORK

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.998
ON. THIS IS A INFRASTRUCTURE

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.666
BANK WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:07.569
AUTHORED BY MARIAN BERGESON AND

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.105
STEVE PEACE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.907
WORKING TOGETHER CREATED A

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.775
FUNDING MECHANISM. THIS BILL

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.477
TAKING NOTE OF THE FACT THAT WE

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.279
HAVE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FLOOD

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:20.148
OF REVENUE. PROPOSES THAT WE

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.750
SHOULD SET ASIDE EIGHT BILLION

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:25.987
DOLLARS. FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.989
THE COULD BE ACCESSED IN

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.524
COUNTIES UNDER MY SPECIAL

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:30.926
DISTRICTS INDEPENDENT FAR

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:33.528
DIFFERENT. A LIKE A VOLUNTEER

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.230
FIRE DEPARTMENT I HAVE WILTED

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:38.333
AND ERROL. AND ARE COUNTIES

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.402
UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. TO

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.604
FOCUS PRIMARILY ON PRIMARILY ON

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.407
DISASTROUS. BUT THAT COULD BE

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:47.242
FACILITIES THAT COULD BE

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.544
UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IT WILL

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.813
BE A SHELTER IN PLACE A VENN

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.082
FIRES LIKE THE AMADOR COUNTY

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:58.420
FAIRGROUNDS- AND ALSO ROAD

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.621
PROJECTS WHICH WOULD BE

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.689
IMPORTANT KIND OF EGRESS FOR.

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:04.326
VIRGIN IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.894
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THIS

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.697
PROGRAM IN THE AYE BANK. WOULD

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.365
BE PAID BY UP FRONT FEES OF

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:12.100
PETITIONS THOSE LOAN PROGRAM

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.202
WOULD HAVE TO PAY FEED I. BAKED

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:15.537
WOULD COVER THE DISTRICT COURT.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.205
THIS PROGRAM. BUT IT WOULD

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.607
ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:21.843
COMPETITIVE GRANTS. TO FUND

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.212
THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND IN

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.815
THAT SENSE I THINK IT IS IT IS

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:29.351
AN AIR OF SO MUCH WHAT WE'VE

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.785
DONE WHERE YOU KNOW. THE LOCAL

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:33.255
GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE PEOPLE

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.422
DEVOTED TO THE WELL BEING OF

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:35.824
THEIR COMMUNITIES. A FUNDING

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.392
STREAM IS REALLY A WAY TO

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.560
RELEASE LOCAL ENERGY ON THESE

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:42.297
TYPES OF PROJECTS. IT REQUIRES

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.699
THAT ANY PROJECT LOCALLY THESE

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.835
FUNDS COULD ONLY GO 250% OF THE

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.703
PROJECT COST WHAT DOES REQUIRE

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.405
DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS TO

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.941
MOVE THIS FORWARD. I ACTUALLY

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.443
THINK THIS IS A- IT IS AN

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.612
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.514
CHALLENGES OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.550
THE UNUSUAL. REVENUES ARE

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.186
PRESENT AVAILABLE AND YOU KINDA

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.755
LOOK ACROSS THE STATE TO SAY

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.823
ACTUALLY THIS IS A TIME TO FILL

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.692
ORDER STEP UP AS A STATE TO

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.527
SUPPORT OUR MORE RURAL COUNTIES

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.063
WHO ARE CHALLENGED BY THINGS AND

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.666
OF. TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDED THEM

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.801
GET BUSY CONTACTED LOCAL FIRE.

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:23.905
ARM IT IS A BILL SUPPORTED BY OR

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:26.775
C. SACK ALLEN'S OF CALIFORNIA.

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.610
THE FIRE DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.712
THE FIRE CHIEFS OF CALIFORNIA

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.281
AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND AS I

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.483
SAY I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IDEA

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.519
IS DESIGNED TO KIND OF BUILD

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.354
UPON THIS ACTED VERY AND

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.590
BURZYNSKI POTTER SO LONG AGO.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.826
WHO REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO KIND

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.027
OF COVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.562
OVERHEAD. BUT BEYOND THAT

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.630
PROVIDE FUNDING THAT COULD

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.632
SUPPORT THE SORTS OF THINGS I

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:51.700
THINK LARGER COUNTIES WILL FIND

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.535
WAYS TO PIECE TOGETHER VITAL

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:56.071
PROJECTS THIS IS REALLY TAKING

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.339
NOTE OF THE CHALLENGING TIMES OF

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.341
A RURAL COUNTIES. I THINK IT

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.676
WOULD BE A- GREAT THING FOR ALL

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.646
OF US I DO NOTE THAT WHEN I WAS

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.281
AN OFFICER OF THE LEAGUE. OF

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.082
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BROUGHT

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.084
MEASURE B. THE STATEWIDE BALLOT

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:12.187
WHICH IS FUNDING FOR. ROADWAYS

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.022
AND A GUARANTEED EVERY CITY AND

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.890
COUNTY AND STATE HAD FUNDS.

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.625
SOBRE WHEN WE DID PROP TWENTY

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.861
ONE WE TOOK CARE OF FUNDING. FOR

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.496
THE ENTIRE STATE. AND EVERY

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.865
JURISDICTION. THIS IS AN IDEA

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.867
THAT DEMONSTRABLY IS POPULAR

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:29.237
WITH CALIFORNIA. AND OKAY THIS

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.406
IS SORT OF. A FIX FOR SAYS THERE

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.074
IS A TIE THE FIRST ABANDONED

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:35.143
HERE CAPTION OF RIDES ON VICTORY

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.845
WE HAVE A LOT OF REVENUE. I

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.546
THINK ALLOWS US THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:41.316
TO TAKE SOME STEPS THAT ARE

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.118
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. A BILLION

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.086
DOLLARS IS A BIG NUMBER BUT I

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:47.222
