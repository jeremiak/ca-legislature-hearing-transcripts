01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.029
THAN THE STATE HAD AVAILABLE SO

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.031
THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE JUST

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:04.632
BEEN MAKING UP THAT GAP. OF IT

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.935
SLOWLY I'D CREEPING CLOSER TO

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:09.337
THAT STATUTORY TARGET THE

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:10.805
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED FULLY

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.507
IMPLEMENTING LCF F. STARTING IN

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:13.708
NINETEEN NINETEEN AND IN FACT

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.977
ALL THREE PACKAGES BEFORE YOU.

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:17.745
THINK GO A STEP FURTHER NOT ONLY

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:19.481
FULLY IMPLEMENTING THOSE OF

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.216
REGIONAL STATUTORY TARGETS PUT

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.351
INCREASING THEM ACROSS THE BOARD

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.653
BY SOME AMOUNT. NOW THIS ACROSS

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.955
THE BOARD INCREASE IS NOT THE

01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:28.490
ONLY OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.892
HAS AVAILABLE FOR AUGMENTING OR

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.760
ADJUSTING THE LC FF BUT IT IS A

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.462
REASONABLE APPROACH. AND IT HAS

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:37.532
TO A BIG BENEFITS FIRST IT HELPS

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.501
ALL SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATE SOME

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.769
ACROSS THE BOARD COST PRESSURES.

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:45.139
INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY PENSION A

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:46.574
CONTRIBUTION INCREASES WHICH I'M

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.109
SURE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT.

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:50.144
AND SECOND FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:53.715
PUT INTO INCREASING THE LC FF

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:54.549
ABOUT SIXTEEN SENSE

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:55.783
GO SPECIFICALLY DEFINED

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.552
INCREASED OR IMPROVE SERVICES

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:59.087
FOR STUDENTS AND DISADVANTAGED

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.289
GROUPS. CURRENTLY THAT WOULD BE

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.390
LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ENGLISH

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.626
LEARNER STUDENTS.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.294
NOW THE ASSEMBLY GOES A STEP

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.129
FURTHER AND MAKES AN ADJUSTMENT

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.765
TO THE LC FF AND SPECIFICALLY TO

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.300
ITS DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.269
STUDENTS ADDING TO IT AND NEW

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.603
GROUP. OF THAT WOULD BE THE

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.438
GROUP THAT IS THE LOWEST

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:18.907
PERFORMING ON STATEWIDE

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:21.109
ASSESSMENTS OF READING AND MATH

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.143
CURRENTLY THAT GROUP IS AFRICAN

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.445
AMERICAN STUDENTS.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.280
THEY ASSEMBLY ESTIMATES IT WOULD

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.514
COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:27.715
MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD THOSE

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.284
STUDENTS.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.984
AND TO THE COUNT OF

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.486
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND AND

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.621
JUST TO BE CLEAR THE WAY EL CFF

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.490
WORKS IS IT'S AN UN DUPLICATED

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.458
COUNT. A DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:40.428
SO CURRENTLY IF AS SOON AS BOTH

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.429
LOW INCOME AND ENGLISH LEARNER

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:42.864
THEY RECEIVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:44.966
RATE BUT THEY'D JUST RECEIVE THE

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.768
SAME RATE AS A STUDENT WHO

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:48.369
BELONGS TO ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER.

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:49.737
I CURRENTLY MOST AFRICAN

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.906
AMERICAN STUDENTS FALL INTO ONE

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.141
OF THESE CATEGORIES SO THIS

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:54.709
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.544
WOULD EXCLUSIVELY GO TOWARDS

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:58.479
PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

01:26:58.546 --> 01:26:59.814
TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.215
ARE NOT LOW INCOME AND NOT

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:03.785
ENGLISH LIKE.

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:05.486
THAT SENATE HAS A PROPOSAL THAT

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.121
IN SOME WAYS SOUND SIMILAR BUT

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.089
IT ACTUALLY WORKS VERY

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.691
DIFFERENTLY THEY IT THEY SET

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.259
ASIDE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.661
MILLION TO CREATE A ONE TIME

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.096
COMPETITIVE GRANT.

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:16.831
FOR THE SCHOOLS SERVING AN

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.167
UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.068
STUDENTS WHO DON'T MEET

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.437
STATEWIDE STANDARDS.

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.339
NOW WE WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:24.872
BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.441
.

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.842
WHO ARE HAPPY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:28.943
THEM IF YOU'D LIKE TO DIG INTO

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.011
THEM EARLY JUST LIKE TO KNOW

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.045
THAT THAT AND THE STATE DOES

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:34.315
HAVE MANY OTHER OPTIONS FOR? A

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:35.850
ADDRESSING ITS PERSISTENT

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.552
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THIS IS AN

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:38.620
ISSUE THAT.

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:40.655
OBVIOUSLY WILL NOT BE RESOLVED

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:42.490
IN THIS THIS BUDGET DELIBERATION

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:43.157
WILL BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL BE

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.759
CONSIDERING. OF FOR MANY YEARS

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.494
TO COME.

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.763
OF THE FINAL ISSUE IN THIS

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:49.664
PACKAGE IS THE ASSEMBLY

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.366
APPROPRIATES TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.334
DOLLARS TO PARTIALLY EQUALIZE

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:54.836
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.871
IN MANY WAYS THIS IS PART AND

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:59.007
PARCEL OF THE AUSSIE FF EFFORT

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.775
WANTED THE OBJECTIVES OF LC FF

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.744
WAS TO REMOVE. HISTORICAL

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.911
FUNDING INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.680
FINANCE IN THE STATE AND WITH

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.714
FULL IMPLEMENTATION WE HAVE

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.916
LARGELY DONE THAT THE LARGEST

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.918
EXCEPTION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:28:10.985 --> 01:28:12.854
WHERE RATES VARY FROM AS LITTLE

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.389
AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.057
STUDENT TO AS MUCH AS FIVE NINE

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:16.591
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:19.627
STUDENT. IS REALLY HAS NO

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.429
LOGICAL BASIS IN THE USER RATES

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.097
THAT HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN PLACE

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:24.365
FOR DECADES.

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.300
AND OUR OFFICE DOES RECOMMEND

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:28.102
TO THE EXTENT OF THE

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.871
LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.406
COMMITTING SIN BICU ON GOING.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.409
EXPENDITURES THAT IT MAKES THIS

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.545
OF ONE OF ITS HIGHEST PRIORITIES.

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:40.415
I THINK YOU TO PART OF FINANCE.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.116
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M FOR

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.251
THE FIRST OUT IN THE LOCAL

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:45.253
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:46.621
AGAIN THIS IS REALLY.

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:47.922
ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.023
NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE AND SO THE

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.059
ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD PREFER

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:52.994
THAT AND BASS FUNDING OUR ON

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:54.429
GOING FUNDING IS REALLY BALLOTS

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:55.630
WITH THE ONE TIME FUNDING TO GET

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:56.998
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE PACKAGE

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.733
ITSELF.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.835
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.070
IN THE ASSEMBLIES VERSION THEY

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.271
USED FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.273
MILLION ONE TIME RESOURCE SAYS.

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.075
THAT WOULD BE USED TO FUND

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.210
ONGOING PROBLEM PROGRAMS EXCUSE

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:10.511
ME SUCH AS THE HEALTHY ABOUT SO

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:11.846
WE WORRY ABOUT USING A ONE TIME

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:12.880
FUNDING SOURCE FOR SOMETHING

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:15.383
THAT'S REALLY ONGOING IN NATURE.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.185
SECONDLY ON THE.

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.253
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.621
WOULD INCREASE THE LC FF A

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.857
TARGET BASE RATES IN NINETEEN

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:24.826
TWENTY. WE WOULD KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.661
I ANY NEW TARGETS WILL CREATE

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:27.595
COST PRESSURES WITHIN THE

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.030
GUARANTEE WE ASK MADE IT WOULD

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.832
AYE. OUT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:33.534
BILLION AND LTFS COST PRESSURES

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:34.802
WITHIN THE GUARANTEE.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.337
SECONDLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.805
WAGE STRUCTURE THE PER PEOPLE

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:38.873
DATA USED IS BASED ON

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.309
EXPENDITURES NOT APPROPRIATIONS

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:42.643
SO THEORETICALLY IF THE DISTRICT

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.011
HAD MONEY THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.780
SPENDS FOR EXAMPLE THEY KEPT

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:47.415
THEIR RESERVES. IT WOULDN'T BE

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.250
CALCULATED UNDER THE STRUCTURE

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:49.817
AND SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.052
WITH THAT.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:54.388
MOVING ONTO A BOTH HOUSES

01:29:54.455 --> 01:29:54.989
INCLUDING.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.991
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPOSALS

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.425
FOR.

01:29:57.492 --> 01:30:00.094
LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS.

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.362
WE WOULD KNOW AGAIN.

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:03.297
THAT IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:04.832
ONE TIME VERSES ON GOING FOR

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.567
THIS PROGRAM WHAT'S APPROPRIATE

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.202
ONTO REALLY FUN THIS PROGRAM

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:09.437
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.139
WE HAVE SOME LEGAL CONCERNS WITH

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:11.939
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.207
ASSEMBLIES PROPOSAL AND

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:14.542
SPECIFICALLY AROUND PROP TWO ON

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.010
NINE.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.678
LASTLY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION THE

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.213
ADMINISTRATION HAS SPENT A LOT

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.915
OF TIME ON SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.216
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:24.252
CYCLES AND WE HAVE PUT FORWARD

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:25.586
SEVERAL DIFFERENCE.

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.288
GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS ON SPECIAL

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.957
EDUCATION TO FURTHER FORTIFY THE

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.626
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF WAS

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:33.094
AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:33.928
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.563
GOVERNANCE CHANGES TAKE PLACE

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:38.132
BEFORE WE HAD BEGIN ENTERTAINING

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:38.699
ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTO THIS

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:39.867
PROGRAM.

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:40.401
WITH THAT HAPPY ANSWER ANY

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.937
QUESTIONS.

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:43.938
WE THINK YOU BACK TO THE

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:44.906
COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:49.510
SENATOR NELSON.

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.680
ON THE LOCAL FUNDING FORMULA

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.182
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE.

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:56.384
TO FOCUS.

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:59.654
IN HELPING THE LOW PERFORMING.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.222
HOW ARE YOU DEFINING THAT

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.358
UNIVERSE?

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:07.195
I'D CURRENTLY THE LCF HAVE.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:09.597
PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING.

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.566
THE STUDENTS WHO FALL IN ONE OF

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.100
THREE CATEGORIES.

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:14.836
LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT'S

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.637
BASED ON ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.139
FEDERAL.

THAT'S CHRONIC DOUBLE TESTING OR

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.381
AN ANECDOTE STATEMENT THERE'S A

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:02.350
THERE'S A TWO STEP PROCESS TO

THE FINAL CATEGORY OUR CHILDREN

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:26.073
IN FOSTER.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.642
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT HOW IT IS

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.911
EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS I WAS A

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.445
MEMBER MANY YEARS AGO OF

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:32.613
SOMETHING CALLED THE FIRST

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.882
BILINGUAL BICULTURAL.

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.517
STUDENT THE.

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:40.154
OR PARENT ADVISORY COUNCIL AND

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.189
SO WE BY FOUGHT OVER THE YEARS.

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:45.359
ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS OF AND

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.495
CONSIDERATIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.864
THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER.

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:51.198
THE THE FUNDING.

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:52.733
MAKES SENSE.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.169
BUT.

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.838
TO INCORPORATE IN OUR BUDGET IN

01:32:57.905 --> 01:33:00.408
THIS WOULD BE IN MANY AREAS.

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:02.643
HOW DO WE?

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:06.814
TEST HOW DO WE ASCERTAIN SUCCESS.

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.816
DEFINING SUCCESS AND THEN HAVING

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:09.984
IT CHECKED SO NEXT YEAR'S

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:11.919
COMMITTEE.

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:13.988
TO LOOK AT THE MONEY EXPENDED.

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.222
AND SEE HOW MANY YOUTH WERE

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.924
SERVING.

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:18.492
THEN WHAT PROGRESS

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:19.827
THEY'RE MAKING YOU HAVE ANY

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:23.831
IDEAS HOW WE MIGHT ACHIEVE THAT.

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:26.200
YEAH I THINK THE.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.802
A CERTAIN BASIC CHALLENGE THAT

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:28.803
THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.204
STRUGGLING WITH FOR MANY YEARS

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.672
IS. WHETHER.

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:33.708
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:35.643
EDUCATIONAL INPUTS ARE ON STERN

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:38.612
OUTCOMES AT THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:40.548
WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON. THESE

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:42.283
ARE PARTICULAR TYPES OF

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.318
EXPENDITURES ARE PROGRAMS THAT.

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:45.920
WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.288
SCHOOLS TO RUN AND WE WILL HOLD

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.556
THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR RUNNING

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.624
THOSE PROGRAMS WITH WITH LC FF

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:52.626
WE'VE TRIED TO SWITCH. TOWARDS A

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:54.562
SYSTEM THAT'S MORE BASED ON

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:55.963
STERN OUTCOMES AND.

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:58.532
AND MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR

01:33:58.599 --> 01:33:59.800
SCHOOLS TO SPEND ON WHATEVER

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:00.968
PROGRAMS THEY THINK ARE

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:04.772
NECESSARY WITH THE PROMISE THAT.

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:07.308
THAT WOULD RESULT IN A IMPROVE

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:09.076
SOON OUTCOMES I I WILL SAY AT

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.512
THIS POINT THE RESULTS DO APPEAR

01:34:11.579 --> 01:34:12.813
SOMEWHAT MIXED ON THAT THE

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.016
ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN FOR

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.851
EXAMPLE LOW INCOME AND NON LOW

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.519
INCOME STUDENTS. HAS NOT

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:20.521
NOTICEABLY BUDGETS IN THE FIRST

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.957
FEW YEARS OF LCF FAT. SO I I DO

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:25.126
THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE.

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:25.993
.

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.728
CONTINUED OVERSIGHT ON THE

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:29.296
LEGISLATURE'S PART AND AND

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:31.165
CONTINUE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.867
ADDITIONAL WORK CAN BE DONE.

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.502
FINE WELL I WOULD LIKE TO

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:37.471
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT. TO

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:38.205
SOME DEGREE HERE I THINK IT'S

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:39.440
IMPORTANT TO.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.809
LAY DOWN A MARKER.

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.277
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.413
ROUTE THERE ARE RESULTS.

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:46.881
FOR THE INVESTMENT OF THE PEOPLE

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.449
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.617
TOO OFTEN WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:50.251
DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ON THAT.

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.953
PLEASE.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.554
GOOD MORNING ONLY SUMMERS AND

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.822
GIVE IT A PART IN A PLANE AND SO

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.490
I RECENTLY IN THE FALL WE'VE

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:57.725
STARTED WE RELEASED THE FIRST.

01:34:57.792 --> 01:35:00.027

ADDITIONAL AND SO YOU WE USED TO

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.034
BE LIKE A REAL HIGH TEST

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:08.803
EVERYTHING WAS BASED ON THE TEST

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:09.670
SCORES NEED THE DASHBOARD NOW

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:14.508

LITTLE.

AS WE PROCEED IN THE.

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.436

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:17.371

MISS COSTA DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHT

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:24.378
ON THAT.

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:25.980
I'M JUST THAT I THINK THIS IS

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:28.282
BEEN AN ISSUE THAT POLICYMAKERS

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:29.717
HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR DECADES

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:32.520
IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT LCF FAST

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.889
AND THE EL CAP REALLY REPRESENT

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:36.524
A PRETTY SEISMIC SHIFT IN HOW WE

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.758
THOUGHT ABOUT EDUCATION

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:39.560
FINANCING. AND HOW WE THINK

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.629
ABOUT OVERALL STUDENT

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:42.663
ACHIEVEMENT AND HOW WE DEFINE

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.533
THAT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED.

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:46.800
WE MOVED FROM A SYSTEM IN WHICH

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:47.635
WE HAD MANY DIFFERENT

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.436
CATEGORICAL AS FOR SEVERAL

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:50.738
DIFFERENT STUDENT SUBGROUPS

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:53.207
ALLOWANCE AT EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS.

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.575
WE HAD THE CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:55.709
SCHOOL EXIT EXAM AND MANY OTHER

01:36:55.776 --> 01:36:57.344
TASKS.

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.746
WE'VE NOW MOVED TO.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.782
A STRUCTURE IN WHICH INSTEAD OF

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.317
IT BEING COMPLIANCE DRIVEN ON

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:05.085
THE STATE SIDE IT'S REALLY

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.687
EMANATING MORE FROM THE LOCALS.

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:09.523
ON AND THEY USE THE EL CAP AS

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.058
WELL AS THE DASHBOARD.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:12.693
AND TO YOUR POINTS TO MEASURE

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.495
PROGRESS.

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:15.863
ON THE HOUSE BROUGHT UP THE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.398
ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND I WOULD KNOW

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:18.265
AGAIN AND THAT'S BEEN A

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:20.401
PERNICIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE STATE

01:37:20.467 --> 01:37:22.136
FOR MANY YEARS.

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:24.672
EONS THAT EXISTED WHEN WE HAVE

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:25.806
THE CATEGORICAL.

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.209
SYSTEM OF A EDUCATION FINANCE

01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:30.044
IN A CONTINUOUS AND IT'S

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.512
CERTAINLY SOMETHING NOT.

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:32.746
ALL OF US NEED TO BE AWARE OF

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:35.416
THE MONITOR ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.951
BY POINT IN ALL THIS TO THE

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.552
COLLEAGUES ON THE CONFERENCE

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.387
COMMITTEE IT IT REQUIRES OUR

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:41.855
ATTENTION THAT HAS BEEN LONG

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:42.456
STANDING.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.692
FOR DECADES.

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:47.661
BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY FOCUS

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:48.696
ON IT AND TRY TO MAKE PROGRESS

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:50.664
IN THIS.

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:52.366
DELIBERATION AT LEAST LIKE TO

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:53.867
BRING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION. AND

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.820
SAVE MONEY.

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.788
TO BE MORE PRUDENT.

01:38:14.855 --> 01:38:15.723
WITH THE DOLLARS THAT THEY

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.693

ATTENTION.

01:38:41.982 --> 01:38:43.617

EDUCATION EQUALIZATION.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.243
THIS TUNER MILLION DOLLARS WOULD

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.277
ADDRESS FUNDING.

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:11.745
RATES WHICH HAVE BEEN UNEQUAL

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:13.314
FOR DECADES.

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:15.716
I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT A DISTRICT

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:16.350
WHERE WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:17.918
RATES.

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:20.120
PER STUDENTS IN OUR STATE AND I

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:21.455
CAN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:22.790
STUDENTS AND FRESNO WITH

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:24.525
DISABILITIES. SHOULD RECEIVE ANY

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.360
LESS FUNDING THAN A STUDENT IN

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:27.828
ANOTHER DISTRICT.

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:29.063
AND WANTS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.698
OF FINANCE IF I CAN UNDERSTAND

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.333
WHAT'S TAKEN US.

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.967
SO LONG WHY IS IT TAKING US

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.035
DECADES TO RESOLVE THIS

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:41.508
INEQUITIES.

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:42.910
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE

01:39:42.976 --> 01:39:45.412
FOCUS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:46.413
REALLY BEEN THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.248
FUNDING FORMULA SO SPECIAL

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.918
EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE GENERAL

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.886
ED STUDENTS FIRST SO ANY MONEY

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:53.921
THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED BY THE

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.089
STATE FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:56.724
FUNDING FORMULA AT ONE TIME

01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:58.392
DISCRETIONARY. GRANTS WHICH ARE

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:00.361
YOU KNOW NEARING. EIGHT BILLION

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.395
DOLLARS IN ANOTHER TWENTY

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.796
BILLION AND I'LL SEE IF AFTER IS

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:05.532
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.234
AS WELL SO.

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:08.569
PUTTING IT IN A UPS POP FOR

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:09.870
SPECIAL EDUCATION WHILE IT'S

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:12.139
IMPORTANT. THAT FUNDING IS

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:13.807
AVAILABLE AND THE LCF UP IT'S

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:15.609
NOT A IF WE PROVIDED MORE

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:17.544
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING IT

01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:19.146
WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT LAST.

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:20.280
OKAY FF MONEY WOULD BE FUNDING

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:21.715
THOSE STUDENTS.

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.784
I'M.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.686
STRUGGLING TO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.254
IS A BUREAUCRATIC WAY OF SAYING

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:28.322
WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.124
THOUGH FOR DECADES.

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:33.293
AND WANTS TO UNDERSTAND.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.061
WE HEARD A DIFFERENCE OF A

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:36.697
DOUBLING BETWEEN ONE COUNTY AND

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:38.198
ANOTHER COUNTY IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:39.800
OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION RATES ARE.

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.002
AND THE EXPENSES ARE THE SAME.

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.737
AND SO I'M JUST REALLY TRYING TO

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.572
PUSH US A LITTLE BIT TO ADDRESS

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.473
A PROBLEM I KNOW WE FOCUSED ON

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.175
LC FF.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:50.577
BUT WANTED JUST TO PUT MY MARKER

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.012
AND TO SAY I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:53.680
ASSEMBLY VERSION.

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:55.582
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REALLY

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:56.917
HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:57.751
FIND A WAY. TO BE SUPPORTIVE AS

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.420
WELL.

01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:02.956
IF I MAY UM TO JUST DOT TELL MY

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:04.925
COLLEAGUES COMMENTS A THINK.

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:06.627
ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS HAS

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:08.162
BEEN TO FULLY FUND LCF PFAFF

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.863
WHICH THANKFULLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:11.231
TO DO BOTH HOUSES OF ADOPTED

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.933
THAT AS WELL AND THAT'S BEEN A

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.835
PRIMARY GOAL. THE ISSUE OF

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:16.537
SPECIAL EDUCATION EQUALIZATION

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.705
IS NOT A NEW ONE EITHER ON IT'S

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:20.374
ONE THAT HAS BEEN DEBATED IN THE

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:20.941
BUDGET.

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:22.643
SEVERAL TIMES AT LEAST DURING

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:23.777
MY CAREER.

01:41:23.844 --> 01:41:27.881
AND SO I THINK IT'S NOT THAT WE

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:29.750
HAVEN'T SOUGHT TO ADDRESS IT BUT

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:31.485
WE WANTED TO REALLY GET TO FULL

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:33.086
FUNDING OF THE BASE AMOUNT FOR

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.888
DISTRICTS FIRST.

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.557
ADDITIONALLY AS I TESTIFIED

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.825
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GOVERNANCE

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:39.226
ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:41.361
ADDRESSED WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.430
IN THIS NEW WORLD OF ALTHEA FAST

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:45.065
AND THE AL CAPP. WE REALLY

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:46.900
WANTED TO ALIGN ITSELF AS BETTER

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.502
WITH THAT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:51.271
AND DEVELOPING THEIR EL CAP. ON

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:52.873
ESPECIALLY BASED ON SOME OF THE

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.107
RESULTS WE SAW FOR SPECIAL

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:55.409
EDUCATION STUDENTS THIS PAST

01:41:55.476 --> 01:42:00.280
FALL.

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:03.183
SENATE MITCHELL.

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:05.185
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A GOOD

THE ASSEMBLIES ON INITIATIVE

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:13.527
AROUND ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:15.028
APPRECIATE.

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.097
ARE BOTH THE AGENDA AND IN THE

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:18.732
LA ELSE DESCRIPTION THEY. REFER

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.200
TO AFTER AMERICAN STUDENTS AND I

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:21.668
THINK THAT'S WHAT GETS US INTO

01:42:21.735 --> 01:42:22.970
DANGEROUS WATERS ONLY TALK ABOUT

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:24.905
PROP TO A NINE BECAUSE I AS AS I

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.140
UNDERSTAND IT. FROM MY COLLEAGUE

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:28.542
ó IN THE ASSEMBLY IN OF THE

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:31.211
FOCUS IS CREATING A SUBGROUP TO

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.113
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE LOWEST

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.381
PERFORMING STUDENTS.

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:36.350
WHO TODAY AND FOR MANY YEARS

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:36.917
HAPPEN TO BE AFTER AMERICAN

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.252
STUDENTS

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:39.920
SO IF WE'RE FOCUSING ON LOWEST

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.588
PERFORMING STUDENTS THAT GROUP

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.724
I'M NOT SURE HOW TOOL NINE?

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.359
TECHNICALLY COMES INTO PLAY FOR

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:45.926
SOMEONE TO ADDRESS THAT I'D

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:47.361
APPRECIATE IT.

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:48.962
THANK YOU SENATOR I'M JUST COMES

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:51.298
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:53.500
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS AROUND

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:56.036
AND THE HEAD SO MAYBE START

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:57.971
AGAIN SOME CONTEXT. SO FAR

01:42:58.038 --> 01:42:59.606
SUBGROUPS STATEWIDE WE HAVE

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.375
SUBGROUPS BASED ON ETHNICITY WE

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:03.176
HAVE SUB GROUP AND BASED ON

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.711
SUSAN DISABILITIES WE HAVE A SUB

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.079
GROUP FOR FOSTER YOUTH LOW

01:43:06.146 --> 01:43:07.781
INCOME CHILDREN.

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.516
AND.

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.552
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:13.253
OTHER LANGUAGE IN THE AS WE

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.155
UNDERSTAND IT AND. TO BE FAIR WE

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:17.457
HAVEN'T SEEN ON THE AYE TRAILER

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:18.625
BILLING WHICH WAS PROPOSAL YET

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.427
BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:22.629
VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT'S

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:23.997
THAT'S AND EXISTENCE RIGHT NOW.

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:27.301
AND THAT BILL BASICALLY AND. AT

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.769
SAYS THAT YOU KNOW THIS THE

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:31.238
SUBGROUP IS DEFINED BY.

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:32.673
BOTH BEING ONE OF THOSE SUB

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:34.741
GROUPS AND AT ELIMINATING ALL

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:36.176
THE SUBGROUPS THAT RECEIVE

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:37.911
FUNDING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES.

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:39.479
SO WHAT THAT DOES ESSENTIALLY IS

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:40.380
THAT ELIMINATES TUNES

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:41.348
DISABILITIES BECAUSE THEY

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:42.516
RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:45.218
IDA. I'M ELIMINATES AND THOSE

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:46.787
SUBGROUPS THAT RECEIVES UP

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:47.621
MIDDLE CONCENTRATION GRANT

01:43:47.688 --> 01:43:49.890
FUNDING. SO. OUR CONCERN IS RUN

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.658
THE FACT THAT WITH THAT LEAVES

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.727
HIS STUDENTS UP. SUBGROUPS ARE

01:43:53.794 --> 01:43:55.395
ONLY BASED ON ETHNICITY. TO THE

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:56.730
LAWYER THOSE PERFORMING WOULD BE

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:58.765
ONLY BASED ON ETHNICITY SATS

01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:01.068
WERE CONCERNED THROUGH POP TUNIC

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:02.202
GOT IT GOT IT.

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:04.171
AND THEN IS THERE A WAY.

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:05.939
TECHNICALLY.

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:06.607
TO AVOID.

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.875
.

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.243
THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.511
COUNSELING NOW THE SUPPORT TO

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.914
THOSE OTHER GROUPS.

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:15.682
WHILE ADDRESSING

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.517
RESOURCES TO THE LOWEST

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:19.853
PERFORMING STUDENTS BASED ON

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.222
THEIR PERFORMANCE ON CASTING IN

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:23.824
YOUR DEVELOP DASHBOARD IS THERE

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.792
A WAY TO DO IT.

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:26.927
SO I UNDERSTANDING IS AND AND

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:27.928
AGAIN WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:28.862
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON IT BUT

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:29.830
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.899
SENATE PROPOSAL. ON DOES.

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:34.368
GET AROUND THIS ISSUE BY

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:35.669
ESTABLISHING ANOTHER SUBGROUP

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.504
THAT'S BASED ON AND TASK

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.072
PERFORMANCE AND I NOTICED THAT

01:44:39.139 --> 01:44:40.807
HE GOT IT GOT IT. TO THE ALLEY

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:43.176
OFF I MAY YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:44.578
IT AND I WOULD AGREE BOTH TO THE

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.079
I'D MINISTRATION AND LA I'LL

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.547
TALK WITH THIS IS A NEW ISSUE

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:48.415
AND THAT'S TRUE.

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.617
I I WOULD HOPE THAT WE MOVE

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:52.419
BEYOND A NOTION OF MONITORING TO

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:54.187
REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THE

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:54.855
REALITY.

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:58.058
AND WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THE

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.227
CURRENT. LAW IS PERFORMING

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:01.862
SUBGROUP IS YOUR RIGHT FOR AFTER

01:45:01.928 --> 01:45:04.031
AMERICAN STUDENTS IT SPANS

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:06.867
SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS WHICH IS

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:07.634
ALL THE MORE TROUBLING.

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:10.203
IN TERMS OF WHY THAT CONTINUES

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:11.905
TO BE WHAT IS IT IN OUR. ON

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.774
SYSTEM THAT IS NOT MEETING THE

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.609
NEEDS OF THIS GROUP OF CHILDREN.

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:17.077
YOU TALK ABOUT THEIR OTHER

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.812
THINGS THE STATE CAN DO TO

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:20.480
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF LOWEST

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.683
PERFORMING STUDENTS THAT YOU

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:23.183
DON'T SUPPORT.

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:25.485
EVEN ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE.

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:27.220
.

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:28.689
PROPOSAL LOTIONS WHAT MIGHT

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.657
THOSE BE.

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.592
AND SO TO BE A LITTLE MORE

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:34.127
SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CONCERNS WE

01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:36.029
WE HAVE A AT THE LEGAL

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.030
CHALLENGES WITH THE ASSEMBLY

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:40.367
pEXPLICATED BUT TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:41.635
THE SENATE APPROACH.

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:44.071
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT.

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:46.139
THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING TO

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.641
ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN A

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:49.376
PERSISTENT AN ON GOING. UP

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:52.012
PROBLEM IS UNLIKELY SAID MAKE

01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:53.580
THIS SORT OF IMPACT THAT WE WE

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:55.716
DESIRE. BUT SO WE DO THINK THAT

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:56.383
ANY.

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.652
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS SHOULD

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.787
JUST AS THE PROBLEM BE ON

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:02.522
ONGOING COMMITMENT.

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:05.125
THE FIRST OPTIONS THAT THAT

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.526
SUGGESTS WOULD BE MODIFICATIONS

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:08.395
TELL CFF SIMILAR TO WHAT THE

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:09.996
ASSEMBLY PROPOSED. I'D AND WE

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:12.065
HAVE MANY OPTIONS BESIDES ADDING

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:13.266
ADDITIONAL GROUPS TO THE ON

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:15.902
DUPLICATED COUNT FOR EXAMPLE. OF

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:18.004
THE LC FF INCLUDES CONCENTRATION

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:19.473
FUNDING WHICH IS.

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:21.274
DESIGNED TO BE TARGETED TOWARDS

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.776
THE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.211
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:26.213
PARTICULARLY WELL TARGETED

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:27.280
ATTRACT ABOUT SIX

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:28.415
PERCENT OF DISTRICTS RECEIVED

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:29.816
THIS FUNDING. IF YOU WERE TO

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:32.686
TARGETED MORE SPECIFICALLY TO.

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.387
JUST THE HIGHEST POVERTY

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:35.822
DISTRICTS FOR THE SAME DOLLAR

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:36.890
AMOUNT YOU CAN.

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:39.292
PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO THEM.

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.561
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE YOU

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:43.797
COULD GO TO AND I DUPLICATED

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.665
COUNT OF STUDENTS WEAR UNDER

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:48.235
WHICH STUDENTS TO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:50.871
ARE BOTH IN FOSTER CARE AND LOW

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:52.572
INCOME WOULD RECEIVE TWICE AS

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.508
MUCH FUNDING AS A A STUDENT WHO

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:55.075
BELONGS TO JUST ONE OF THOSE

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:56.943
CREW.

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:59.012
AND THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES.

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:01.214
I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:03.016
MANY OPTIONS BEFORE IT ON IT BUT

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:05.018
OUR GENERAL ADVICE WOULD BE

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.586
BECAUSE THIS IS A PERSISTENT

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:08.188
PROBLEM. YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:09.623
AT SOME ONGOING SOLUTION

01:47:09.689 --> 01:47:12.692
THANK YOU.

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:13.226
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:14.561
OBERNOLTE.

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:16.129
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:18.031
BRIEFLY I SHARE THE CONCERNS THE

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.399
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THE

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.168
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE.

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:23.036
THE ASSEMBLY IS.

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:24.638
BOB PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THAT

01:47:24.704 --> 01:47:26.873
THIS IS A A PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:27.741
REALLY IT IS.

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:30.076
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND.

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:31.344
THE SENATE PROPOSAL I THINK.

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.612
.

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.281
AND DOES IT IN A WAY THAT IS

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:36.416
APPROPRIATE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:37.684
THAT IT'S OUTSIDE OF LCF F. AND

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:39.486
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE. BECAUSE

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:41.054
AS THE LOW POINTS OUT.

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.455
THIS IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM AND

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:43.623
IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.292
OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:47.327
A LOT OF KNOW HOW. ON I HAVE

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:49.095
HELPING TO SOLVE AND I I'D LIKE

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:49.729
TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.531
DO THAT SO. IT WOULD BE NICE TO

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:52.799
SEE THE SENATE PROPOSAL ADOPTED

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.568
BUT BUT WITH THE PROVISION OF

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:58.338
PUTS IT UNDER LC FF.

01:47:58.405 --> 01:48:04.044
THANK YOU SIMILAR METROPOLIS.

01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.378
LIKE JUST DISCUSSION I'VE BEEN

01:48:05.445 --> 01:48:06.913
ON THE.

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.481
SUB TO FOR SIX YEARS DOWN THE

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:09.950
ASSEMBLY.

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.184
AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SEE

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:14.221
THE. DEVELOPMENT AND.

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:15.722
OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING HAS HAD

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:17.490
ON THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:19.893
WITHIN THE STATE.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:22.362
I THINK OF A COUPLE ITEMS HAVE

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:24.431
NOT BEEN DISCUSSION THAT.

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:25.332
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:28.034
UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN USE MONEY

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.202
TO INFLUENCE HAD AN EDUCATIONAL

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.104
ENVIRONMENT.

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:31.404
ONE OF THE.

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.106
LOW.

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.140
ISSUES THAT OFTEN COMES WHEN YOU

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:35.809
VISIT.

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:37.777
SCHOOLS AND TALK TO PARENTS IN

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.112
THE IN PROFESSIONALS ARE YOU'LL

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.981
FIND OUT. THE GREATEST IMPACT

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:42.549
UPON THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILD

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:44.451
AS A PARENT.

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.986
THE* SECONDARILY BE TO TEACH

01:48:46.052 --> 01:48:47.888
THE TEACHER.

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.489
SO WHAT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.324
ONLY STARTED THIS IT WAS STE.

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:52.726
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FONT OF

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:53.860
KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT OUT OF

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:55.462
SACRAMENTO DO YOU CATEGORICAL

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:56.630
BUT TO PUT IT DOWN WITH IN THE

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:58.164
DISTRICTS.

01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:59.666
AND UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:01.635
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. AND

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.303
FRESNO OR BAKERSFIELD ARE

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.839
CARLSBAD WHICH I REPRESENT.

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:07.474
SO WE PUSHED OF MONEY DOWN THERE

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.075
BUT WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THERE

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.477
WAS SOME CONSTERNATION FUNDING

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:11.378
FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:13.013
LEARNERS. AND ECONOMIC ISSUES

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.814
AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS A GOOD

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.283
IDEA BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:17.918
PAST.

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:19.920
THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR YEARS

01:49:19.986 --> 01:49:21.554
JUST CHANGE

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:22.389
ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:24.291
OF EL CAPS.

01:49:24.357 --> 01:49:27.894
A LOT OF PARENTS WERE INVOLVED.

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:28.795
I HAVE A BILL GOING THROUGH

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:30.397
REQUIRING THAT THE PARENTS

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:31.431
ACTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN THE

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.333
DEVELOPMENT AL CAPS OFF MY FIRST

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.367
STATEMENT MOST PORN EDUCATION IS

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:35.068
APPARENT.

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.836
SO.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.571
THE YEAH DEL CAPS FROM OF ALL

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:40.607
MEANING GOING WE HAVE CARVED OUT

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:42.309
SOME MONEY BEFORE. OFF FOR

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:44.077
FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE SPECIAL

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.713
NEEDS I'VE HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.247
ATTEND THE NUMBER OF THE

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:49.182
SEMINARS. A SPECIAL NEED TO

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.618
UNDERSTAND THAT IS VARIED ACROSS

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:53.954
THE STATE BECAUSE SOME SCHOOL

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.388
AND OTHERS. HAVE THESE

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:56.656
CONSORTIUM SAY LOOK THEY'RE

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.625
LOOKING AT REGIONAL SOLUTIONS

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:00.460
FOR BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.896
AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:04.631
TO ALLOW LOCAL.

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:05.231
AGENCIES FIGURED TO DEAL WITH

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:06.533
THE BEST WAY TO DO IS SPECIAL

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:07.834
NEEDS.

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:10.103
AND SO.

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:12.205
I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF A

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:13.473
CONTINUING THIS PROCESS LOCAL

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.742
PATROL FUNDING.

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:18.044
I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:20.313
DEVELOP THE ALL CAPS.

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.082
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN JUST

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:23.750
LISTEN TO PEOPLE TALK THAT.

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:25.251
A DASHBOARD IS SOMETHING YOU CAN

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:26.753
PULL UP ON YOUR COMPUTER RIGHT

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.620
NOW AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:29.622
YOUR DISTRICTS.

01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:31.491
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT.

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:32.993
I TO BE ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IT

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:34.461
SENATORS USE WHEN THEY VISIT

01:50:34.527 --> 01:50:35.795
AREAS SAYING HERE'S YOUR

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:38.064
DASHBOARD IS JUST WHAT YOU WANT

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:39.632
TO BE SAYING AND THERE. IT'S A

01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:41.968
BEGINNING PROJECT WE'VE ADDED CT

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:43.236
IN IT AND SOME OTHER ITEMS THAT

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:44.371
WE'RE LOOKING AT AND SPECIAL

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:45.672
NEEDS.

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:48.074
SO THE DASHBOARD IS REALLY THE

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.943
METRIC OF SUCCESS THAT WE CAN

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:51.745
GET THE PARENTS INVOLVED SIDE

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:54.047
ASK YOUR WE LOOK AT THAT.

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:56.249
MY FINAL POINT IS THIS.

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:58.184
BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE

01:50:58.251 --> 01:50:59.652
WHO WOULD QUESTION CREASE

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:00.186
FUNDING FOR LOCAL CONTROL

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:01.554
FUNDING.

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.256
FORMULA BUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.191
I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT.

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:06.292
I THINK WE NEED TO DOIT BECAUSE

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:07.560
HAVE I SAID IN THE LAST SAID TO

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:08.828
MEETING.

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.296
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE ECONOMY

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:11.865
GOES UP OR DOWN.

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:14.934
A WE HAVE LEARNED THAT IF YOU.

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:15.935
SHORT CHANGE EDUCATION IS JUST

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:18.071
NOT.

01:51:18.138 --> 01:51:19.773
LAS CHILDREN AND.

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.307
IN A PARTICULAR GRADE PERIOD

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:22.108
ACTUALLY HAS A HUGE ECONOMIC

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:24.010
IMPACT.

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.745
AND SO I WOULD MUCH RATHER

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:26.913
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:27.714
INFORMED WORKING.

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.449
PUBLIC

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.451
I CAN GET A GOOD JOB.

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.887
THEN DO PUT IN A PROGRAM.

01:51:33.953 --> 01:51:36.956
BECAUSE SOMEBODY CAN'T GET A JOB.

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:38.324
SO I.

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.560
CAN TREAT A STRONGLY RECOMMEND

01:51:40.627 --> 01:51:42.429
THAT WE CONTINUE TO. INCREASE

01:51:42.495 --> 01:51:43.730
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN LOCAL

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.165
TWELVE FUNDING.

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.533
INVESTMENT AND PARENTS INVOLVED

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.034
THE EL CAP.

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:50.103
AND PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING REALLY

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.638
THE METRICS OF THE DASHBOARD IS

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:52.872
SEEN WITH THE SUCCESS IS GOING

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.774
ON HERE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.276
WE SHOULD GO BACK TO WHERE WE

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:58.278
WERE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.412
AND THANK THE FONT OF KNOWLEDGE

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.281
IN SACRAMENTO. TO CARVE OUT

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.782
MONEY FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.517
I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:05.852
GOVERNOR IN IS PLANNED TO GO

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:11.157
FORWARD JUST MORE MONEY IN IT.

01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:13.059
I THINK IT'S CHAVEZ.

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.394
IF I'M I MEAN JUST ONE FINAL

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:16.563
COMMENT AS A POINT OF CONTACTS

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.531
BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR IN

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.100
THEIR BUDGET PLANS HAVE SIXTY

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:21.601
EIGHT MILLION TO CREATE A NEW

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:23.570
STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FROM

01:52:23.636 --> 01:52:25.472
LOW PERFORMING DISTRICTS.

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:27.107
THIS MONEY IS INTENDED TO

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:29.175
IDENTIFY DISTRICTS WE KNOW THAT

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:30.410
THE FIRST GROUP OF DISTRICTS

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:31.478
HAVE ISSUES WITH THEIR SPECIAL

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.146
ED PERFORMANCE.

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.747
THERE'S LOTS OF DISTRICTS THAT

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:36.983
HAVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ISSUES AND

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.952
THE SYSTEM CAN IDEALLY BE USED

01:52:39.018 --> 01:52:40.587
TO ADDRESS THIS PANOPLY OF

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:42.388
PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND AS LONG

01:52:42.455 --> 01:52:43.623
AS THE LEGISLATURE REMAINS

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.492
FOCUSED ON PERFORMANCE ISSUES

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:47.260
INCLUDING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. IT

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:49.896
HAS WAY IS TO I THINK DIRECT

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.297
MONEY IT'S CITIES PERFORMANCE.

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:54.367
I'M PROBLEMS.

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:55.969
IF I MAY JUST THAT TELL ON THAT

01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.237
POINT I THINK THE POLICY

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:58.972
QUESTION FOR EACH OF US TO

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:01.040
GRAPPLE WITH IS IN THE SYSTEM OF

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:03.143
SUPPORT. WE'RE REALLY FUNDING

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:04.477
CAPACITY BUILDING AT THE LOCAL

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.112
LEVEL.

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.514
ON THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU AND

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:08.882
CONFERENCE ARE REALLY MONEY

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:10.950
DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS DISTRICTS

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:12.185
SPECIFICALLY ANYTHING THE

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.353
ADMINISTRATION HAS LONG BEEN

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:14.921
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BUILD

01:53:14.988 --> 01:53:16.823
CAPACITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:17.957
CANDIDLY MANY DISTRICTS ARE

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.826
EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE VERY

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.227
SAME ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.362
SO WE'D LIKE TO BUILD UP OUR

01:53:22.428 --> 01:53:23.963
KNOWLEDGE BASE STATEWIDE TO MAKE

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:25.365
SURE THE ALL DISTRICTS CAN AND

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:26.733
TO LEARN FROM THAT TO DEAL WITH

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:27.467
SOME OF THESE.

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:29.435
SUBGROUP ISSUES THAT THEY'RE

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:32.438
EXPERIENCING LOCALLY.

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:33.173
WELL THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW

01:53:33.239 --> 01:53:34.541
WHERE ALL STILL TRYING TO

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:36.609
GRAPPLE WITH HOW BEST TO.

01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:39.612
SHRINK THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP I

01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:40.647
KNOW IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:41.948
I KNOW EVERYBODY UP HERE AND

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:43.249
WENT DOWN THERE IS AS QUITE

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:44.350
CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:46.753
ON ONE OF THE ISSUES I THINK

01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:47.320
WE'VE ALL BEEN.

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:49.722
STRUGGLING WITH THIS YES THE

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:50.657
MONEY IS GETTING TO TO DISTRICTS

01:53:50.723 --> 01:53:51.658
HOW DO WE ASSURE THE MONEY IS

01:53:51.724 --> 01:53:53.426
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE SCHOOLS.

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:56.162
SO IN FACT IF I COULD HEAR FROM

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:58.298
AYE WELL FINANCED TO IN WHICH OF

01:53:58.364 --> 01:53:58.898
YOUR FEEDBACK AND MAKING SURE

01:53:58.965 --> 01:53:59.632
THAT.

01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:01.267
I HOW HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:02.735
ENSURING THAT THE MONEY IS

01:54:02.802 --> 01:54:03.670
GETTING INTO THE CLASSROOM NOT

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:05.572
JUST TO THE DISTRICT THAT

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:09.209
NEITHER.

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:10.543
.

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:12.612
SO.

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:13.613
THERE A LOT OF.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.515
ISSUES I'VE BEEN RAISED WITH

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:17.083
THIS GENERAL QUESTION OF

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.184
TRANSPARENCY OVER LC FF

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.752
EXPENDITURES.

01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:22.422
I THINK THAT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:23.556
THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING OUR

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.692
SCHOOL LEVEL EXPENDITURES.

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:28.127
SO THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.896
HEAR A LOT FROM THE FIELD JUST

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:30.263
TO EXPLAIN THAT.

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.265
.

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:33.833
AND THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW THE

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:34.500
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.269
.

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:39.105
METHODS THAT WE HAVE FOR ALL

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.406
SEAFOODS EXPENDITURES ARE

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:42.709
EXCLUSIVE TO ARE FOCUSED ON THE

01:54:42.775 --> 01:54:45.044
DISTRICT LEVEL. I DISTRICTS

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:47.013
SUBMIT EL CAPS THAT SAY

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.982
GENERALLY WHAT ARE THEIR THEIR

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.617
PLANS FOR EXPANDING THESE FUNDS.

01:54:50.683 --> 01:54:52.018
FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS OF

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:54.487
MANY ADVOCATES IS CLAIMED THAT

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:55.822
THERE WOULD BE MORE RELEVANT TO

01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:56.756
REPORT THIS.

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:59.092
AT A SCHOOL LEVEL.

01:54:59.158 --> 01:55:01.828
THAT'S BEEN AN AREA OF

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:03.496
CONTROVERSY I I I BELIEVE THE

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:05.064
ADMINISTRATION.

01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:05.798
IS OPPOSED TO IT.

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:07.533
.

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.303
LEGISLATING OF THE FIELD.

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:11.204
THANK YOU.

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:15.408
FINANCE.

01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:18.111
SO A I HESITATE TO ANSWER THIS

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:19.812
QUESTION OR SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:21.714
IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES BECAUSE

01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:23.016
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THAT THEY'RE

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:24.584
A OF SIMPLE ISSUE.

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:26.019
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO NOTE A

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.754
COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.656
FIRST THE TRANSITION TO LOCAL

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:31.424
CONTROL HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT

01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:33.026
SIMPLE.

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:34.727
IT'S A VERY BIG LEFT

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:36.629
IT'S A HUGE CULTURE SHIFT.

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.865
ON YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IN SOME

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:40.433
WAYS FOR FOR LOCALS IT IT COULD

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.702
BE EASIER TO SAY WELL WE HAVE TO

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:43.303
DO THIS BECAUSE THE STATE SAYS

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:44.704
SO.

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:45.905
BUT NOW THEY HAVE TO SAY WELL

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:47.206
WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE ALL

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:48.708
AGREE IT CELL AND THAT'S A VERY

01:55:48.775 --> 01:56:05.258
DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:06.392
CONVERSATION I

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:07.126
HAD WITH YOUR COMMUNITY.

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:08.027
I WOULD PIGGYBACK ON SOME OF THE

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:08.528
THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD.

01:56:08.594 --> 01:56:09.362
ALL OF YOU SAY REGARDING AND

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:09.896
ENGAGING WITH PARENTS AND

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:10.229
COMMUNITIES.

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:10.930
I THINK SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:11.597
AN EXCELLENT JOB OF REACHING OUT

01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:12.999
WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

01:56:13.066 --> 01:56:14.400
UNDERSTANDING. ON WHAT THEY NEED

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:15.034
TO SAY AND HOW THEY NEED TO SAY

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:16.936
IT

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:18.838
WE'VE PROPOSED AND BOTH HOUSES

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:22.208
HAVE ADOPTED AND FUNDS TO HELP

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.343
AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:25.745
COMMUNITIES BECOME A BETTER

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:26.346
ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:26.979
THEY'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS

01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:28.781
THAT WE THINK THAT. THAT'S AN

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:30.616
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS.

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:33.319
AND WE HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:35.288
SCHOOL SITE LEVEL EXPENDITURE

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.123
REPORTING ON IN THE WAY THAT

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:38.858
IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US.

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.159
THE WAY THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:42.061
HAS.

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:44.430
REALLY FOCUSED ON TRACKING

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.732
INDIVIDUAL DOLLARS TO INDIVIDUAL

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:46.666
KIDS.

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:47.867
AND WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:50.570
SEVERAL LEVELS ONE THAT'S A HUGE

01:56:50.636 --> 01:56:52.405
A WORKLOAD THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:53.673
RATHER SEE THOSE FUNDS IN THAT

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.908
WORKLOAD GO INTO THE CLASSROOM.

01:56:55.975 --> 01:56:57.377
I THINK ALSO THERE CAN BE

01:56:57.443 --> 01:56:59.612
PROBLEMS.

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:00.947
THOUGH SOPHOCLES WITH THE IDEA

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:01.581
THAT YOU WANT TO TRACK KIDS TO

01:57:01.647 --> 01:57:03.916
TWO DOLLARS.

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:04.884
SO I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.252
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BUT WE

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:07.320
THINK THAT THERE'S SORT OF A

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:08.654
MIDDLE GROUND.

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.189
BETWEEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:12.024
PROVIDED ON AND WHETHER NOT IT'S

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:13.793
HELPFUL.

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.128
I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:19.132
ALL AGREED THAT THE EL CAP WAS

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:19.665
GOING TO BE THIS AMAZING

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:21.434
DOCUMENT THAT WAS GONNA. YOU

01:57:21.501 --> 01:57:22.835
KNOW TELL PARENTS EXACTLY WHAT

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:23.503
THEY NEED TO KNOW AND HELP THEM

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:24.170
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. BUT

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:25.238
WE'VE HEARD THAT IT'S KIND OF A

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:27.373
MIXED BAG.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.274
AHMED SO WE KNOW THAT THAT NEEDS

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.809
TO WORK AS WELL. AND SO I THINK

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:30.743
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:34.313
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS I THINK WE

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:34.881
JUST DON'T WANNA GO DOWN THE

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:37.417
ROAD OF PUTTING A TON OF WORK

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:39.285
INTO SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT HAVE.

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:40.553
IT MAY NOT PROVIDE THE VALUE

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.454
THAT WE THINK IT WELL.

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:42.422
AND REALLY FOCUSING MORE ON

01:57:42.488 --> 01:57:44.056
ENSURING THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:45.625
THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FESTER

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:47.226
LOCALLY FOR DECADES. THAT WERE

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.261
MAKING SOME INROADS IN

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:50.029
ADDRESSING THOSE.

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:51.164
BECAUSE WE CAN PUT ALL THE MONEY

01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:52.598
IN THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:54.500
INTO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:57:54.567 --> 01:57:56.769
BUT IF IF THERE COMMUNITIES ARE

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.205
NOT WORKING ON IT IN PARTNERSHIP

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:00.506
WITH THEM IN THEIR COUNTIES ARE

01:58:00.573 --> 01:58:01.707
WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM.

01:58:01.774 --> 01:58:02.942
TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THAT

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.444
REALLY ARE ARE DEEPER THAN JUST

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.078
MONEY. I'M WE'RE REALLY

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:07.980
CONCERNED WE WON'T MAKE ANY ANY

01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:10.583
MOVEMENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.784
GREAT THANK YOU NOW THAT TO

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:13.085
CHALLENGES.

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:13.286
THAT.

01:58:13.352 --> 01:58:15.288
.

01:58:15.354 --> 01:58:17.590
WHAT WE GAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:20.092
DO SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN DOING

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:21.727
THEM FOR YEARS AND DECADES AND

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.996
OTHERS?

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:25.898
THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT

01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:27.366
SO I THINK THAT IS HOW I THINK

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:28.701
THE CHALLENGE OF OUTLINED WHICH

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.837
IS A.

01:58:30.903 --> 01:58:32.305
TO SOME EXTENT A STRUGGLE RIGHT

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:33.372
BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING TOM THE

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:35.441
INTO. THE WHOLE MODEL THE WHOLE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:37.043
TWENTY FOR ME THAT WAS SET UP

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:39.278
BASED ON THE. ASSUMPTION THAT

01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:40.980
DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.515
FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS AND

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:43.749
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:44.250
TO.

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:48.488
.

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:50.156
FUNDING AND HOW. THAT FUNDING

01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:51.858
FORMULA BOX THEY CAN GET GENUINE

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.626
FEEDBACK PROCESS JUST TALKING TO

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:55.194
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE OR EVEN JUST

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:56.662
TALKING TO THE SCHOOL BOARD

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:58.264
MEMBERS I THINK. ON THE.

01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.966
IF THERE'S SOME WAY FOR US TO

01:59:00.032 --> 01:59:02.168
BETTER UNDERSTAND OUT.

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:04.237
WITHOUT CREATING.

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:05.838
LOT MORE BUREAUCRACY I THINK

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:07.807
THAT WOULD BE BE HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:09.175
I.

01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:11.611
IDEOLOGY SAUSAGE FOR FOR MY

01:59:11.677 --> 01:59:12.311
DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO I

01:59:12.378 --> 01:59:14.280
THINK. THERE'S THEIR THEIR OWN

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:15.781
FEELING IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:18.217
DOING THIS FOR DECADES AND THEY

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:20.286
HAVE A SET WAY OF DOING IT. BUT

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:21.254
THERE'S NO WAY TO REALLY

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.055
EVALUATE IS IT ISN'T REALLY THE

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:24.657
RIGHT WAY TO DO IT IS IT REALLY

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:25.992
THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

01:59:26.058 --> 01:59:27.693
WAY TO DO IT I KNOW AS A PARENT

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:30.129
MYSELF HOME I. HAVE NEVER HEARD

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:31.464
THE WORDS LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:34.767
FORMULA OR AL CAPP OR. YOU KNOW.

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:37.837
FUNDING OR EXETER IMAGES JUST

01:59:37.904 --> 01:59:40.206
IT'S DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FLOW

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.274
HASN'T FLOWED BACK TO ME AS A

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:43.175
PARENT.

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:44.677
SO THAT THAT TO ME IS VERY

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:45.945
CONCERNING BECAUSE IF I'M A

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.113
PARENT AND ONE OF THE MOST

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:50.883
ENGAGED CITIES IN OUR STATE. ON

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.219
HOW I CAN JUST IMAGINE IS A CITY

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.754
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LAST ENGAGE

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.622
IN MIND. AYE WHERE PEOPLE TEND

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:58.157
TO SORT OF TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

01:59:58.224 --> 02:00:00.760
THAT I THINK THAT ON WE WE FACE

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:01.894
A VERY DAUNTING CHALLENGE THAT

02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:03.596
IT'S IT'S THE ABSOLUTE LYNCH PIN

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:04.630
OF THE.

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:06.232
PROMISE OF OUR FUNDING FORMULA

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:08.134
SO I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. THINK

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.202
ABOUT THAT AND I AGREE THAT

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:11.370
NECESSARY MONEY IS NOT

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:14.240
NECESSARILY ALWAYS THE ISSUE BUT.

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:15.575
I THINK WHEN WE DID THIS FORMULA

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:16.976
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.744
WE WILL TRY TO MAKE UP FOR LOST

02:00:18.811 --> 02:00:20.313
TIME MAKE UP FOR LOST GROUND AND

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:21.948
I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T

02:00:22.014 --> 02:00:23.549
WAIT FOR ANOTHER TEN YEAR SO

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:25.384
THAT SOME PHD IS FROM SOME

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:27.420
UNIVERSITY CAN STUDY THIS. AT

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:28.788
THAT POINT MY KIDS WILL HAVE

02:00:28.854 --> 02:00:30.623
FORTY GRADUATE.

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:31.257
SO.

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:32.758
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME ITS

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.794
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO AS POLICY

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.929
MAKERS MAKE THE BEST DECISION

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:37.530
WITH THE BEST INFORMATION THAT

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:38.531
WE HAVE.

02:00:38.598 --> 02:00:40.266
HERE TODAY AND I THINK WHAT WE

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:41.801
ARE AT KNOWLEDGE IN AND I THINK

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:42.435
WITH ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE AROUND

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.770
THE TABLE ON BOTH SIDES OUT THAT

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:45.371
WE DO HAVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:47.473
THAT. SEVEN YEARS OR SIX YEARS

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.908
INTO THIS.

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.843
YOU KNOW MISTER CHAVEZ AND I

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.011
WERE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:54.347
PASSED LCS HALF. ON.

02:00:54.413 --> 02:00:55.548
SIX YEARS GOING INTO IT WE

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:56.882
HAVEN'T SEEN THE KIND OF

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.451
PROGRESS THAT WE. HAVE HOPE I

02:00:58.517 --> 02:00:59.218
DON'T THINK WE WERE EXPECTING

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:00.820
MIRACLES BUT THE SAME TIME I

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:01.754
THINK WE HAD WE WERE HOPING TO

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.823
SEE. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROGRESS

02:01:03.889 --> 02:01:05.791
GIVEN THE HUGE INVESTMENT WE'VE

02:01:05.858 --> 02:01:07.360
MADE.

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:09.795
SO ARM AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:11.397
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OURSELVES TO

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:12.565
MAYOR IN BE IT YOU KNOW IT'S

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:13.399
IT'S IT'S REALLY.

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:15.468
IS IS YOU KNOW REALLY THE RIGHT

02:01:15.534 --> 02:01:16.802
DIRECTION TO CONTINUE DOWN OR DO

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:18.004
WE NEED TO DO SOME MODIFICATION

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:20.139
I THINK BOTH HOUSES. HAVE COME

02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:21.974
UP WITH PROPOSALS TO.

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:23.743
AUGMENTED I THINK WE TAKE A

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.412
SERIOUS LOOK AT THE ACTORS. ON

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:26.979
IT YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THE

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:27.847
DEFINITION OF INSANITY WHICH IS

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:29.181
DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:30.783
OVER AGAIN EXPECTING A DIFFERENT

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.118
RESULT SOUTH. ON I KNOW THAT

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.319
FUNDING FORMULA WAS TING

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:34.387
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT WE WERE

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:35.755
PURSUING GAP I THINK WE DO HAVE

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:37.056
TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THIS

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:38.958
FUNDING FORMULA STILL IS IN THE

02:01:39.025 --> 02:01:40.793
INITIAL STAGES WE STILL NEED TO

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:44.430
PROVIDE THE FEEDBACK AND WE'RE

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:45.031
HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:45.798
THAT.

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:46.499
THEY THEY HAVEN'T FELT.

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:48.334
SO I THINK THAT IS

02:01:48.401 --> 02:01:50.536
THE FEEDBACK THAT I BEEN GETTING

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.038
WHICH IS THAT THEY THEY HAVE A

02:01:52.104 --> 02:01:53.739
SENIOR SO AGAIN. ON THIS IS

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:54.840
SOMETHING THAT IS TOUCHING ALL

02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:55.975
OF OUR COMMUNITIES ALL OF OUR

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.810
NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK IT'S VERY

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:58.544
IMPORTANT TO.

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:00.579
LISTENED TO THAT NOT JUST NOT

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:01.881
JUST.

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:04.417
BE DEFENSIVE ABOUT THEM NOT

02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:05.651
JUST DEFEND WHAT WE HAVE DONE

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:07.920
THE TO SAY HEY WE TOOK A BIG

02:02:07.987 --> 02:02:09.989
STEP. NOW WE HAVE TO KEEP.

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.424
IMPROVING AND I THINK THAT'S

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:13.125
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WERE I

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:14.827
THINK AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY SINK

02:02:14.894 --> 02:02:16.328
LIKE WE WE TOOK A BIG STEP WE

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:17.163
THINK THIS IS STILL THE RIGHT

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.064
DIRECTION BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:19.532
DOZEN DEPARTMENT.

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:22.401
SENATE MITCHELL.

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:24.970
INTERESTING AND AND LISTEN TO

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:40.252
WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:42.054
CLASSROOM PROBABLY BY TEACHERS

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:43.189
AND NOT ALWAYS IN A POSITIVE

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:44.657
LIGHT WHICH BIG WHICH KIND OF

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.759

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:55.434
PERSPECTIVE ABOUT A REGULAR

BASIS ANYWAY I HOPE HOPE FROM.

02:02:58.237 --> 02:03:00.906
WHO EXACTLY IN THE HE HE AUGUST

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:06.746
?

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:08.481
I HEAR YOU WINNING WHEN YOU SAY

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:10.349
IT'S NOT JUST MONEY I GET THAT.

02:03:10.416 --> 02:03:13.219
AND YET IN IN ALL AS AS BUDGET

02:03:13.285 --> 02:03:14.920
COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN ALL

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:16.822
DISCUSSIONS AROUND INVESTMENT OF

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.691
OF.

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.726
VERY.

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:22.228
HARD FOUGHT FOR DELICATE PUBLIC

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:23.996
DOLLARS

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:26.198
THE THE PUBLIC AS WE ALL ARE

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:27.466
LOOKING FOR A RETURN ON THE

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:29.869
INVESTMENT ARE LOOKING FOR.

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:31.971
TRANSPARENCIES WE CAN TRACK THE

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:32.838
DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:35.407
THERE'S NO WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:37.076
SOULS YOU KNOW THE FAMOUS QUOTE.

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:38.711
AND SO IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:40.146
SAY IT'S NOT JUST MONEY WHEN YOU

02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:41.680
THERE'S A GROUP OF ADVOCATES WHO

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:42.715
CURRENTLY ARE ARGUING FOR YOU

02:03:42.782 --> 02:03:45.151
KNOW TWENTY K. BY TWENTY TWENTY.

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:47.052
AND YOU WE ALL WILL CAUCUSES TO

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:49.488
SIX UP ABOUT OUR PER PUPIL

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:50.623
INVESTMENT COMPARED TO OTHER

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:52.258
STATES IN CALIFORNIA'S NOW THE

02:03:52.324 --> 02:03:53.592
FORTY NINTH AT THE. EIGHTY

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:55.060
EIGHTH OUT OF FIFTY STATES

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:56.729
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SALT

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:59.231
WHILE WE SAY IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT.

02:03:59.298 --> 02:04:01.133
THE DOLLARS AND THEN YET.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.434
IT SEEMS TO ALSO BE

02:04:02.501 --> 02:04:04.336
AND SO IT'S IT'S

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:07.072
IT'S CHALLENGING WHEN WE DON'T

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:08.808
HAVE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL. ON

02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:11.310
TRANSPARENCY FOR US AS POLICY

02:04:11.377 --> 02:04:13.479
MAKERS WHO WHO FOLLOWED THE

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.980
GOVERNOR'S VISION AROUND LOCAL

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:17.216
CONTROL FUNDING DOWN THIS PATH.

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:19.185
BASED ON SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:21.720
HOW DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE I

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:23.355
APPRECIATE IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:25.658
BUT I GET I THINK MY CONCERN IS

02:04:25.724 --> 02:04:28.027
KIDS DON'T GET DO ALL VERSE.

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.995
AND SO WHILE THIS GROUP OF THE

02:04:30.062 --> 02:04:31.897
BIG KIDS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

02:04:31.964 --> 02:04:33.732
OUT THIS CULTURE SHIFT LITTLE

02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:37.336
HEADS ARE CONTINUING TO SUFFER.

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:39.205
WHILE WE.

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.172
ART.

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:43.142
SEEM SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:45.144
FROM THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:46.779
HELP AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:48.314
INVESTMENT.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.049
AND SO I YOU KNOW THERE IS A

02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:51.116
CONCERN AROUND THE LACK OF

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:54.220
TRANSPARENCY AND HOW WE CANNOT.

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:56.021
COMFORTABLY SAY AS POLICY MAKERS

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:57.823
AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THIS NEW

02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:59.758
LOVE CONTROL EMPHASIS THAT THE

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.260
DOLLARS ARE.

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:02.862
FOLLOWING THE STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:05:02.928 --> 02:05:04.797
IN GREATEST NEED I THINKAS A

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:06.365
RESULT OF THAT YOU DO GET

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:08.734
POLICIES FROM BOTH HOUSES TRYING

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.536
TO. CREATE.

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:12.838
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO SUPPORT

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:15.207
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:18.277
EVERYDAY IN CALIFORNIA PUBLICLY

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:20.145
FUNDED SCHOOLS.

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.413
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME.

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.182
.

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:26.151
YOU KNOW WE WE CAN DISAGREE ON

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.953
THE TECHNICALITY WHETHER IT'S

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:28.921
LEGAL UNDER PROP TWO ONE NINE OR

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:31.090
NOT OR HOW WE DO IT BUT I THINK

02:05:31.156 --> 02:05:32.458
THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE A

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:35.327
RESPONSE. FROM THIS BODY ABOUT

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:38.130
HOW WE FIX IT IN REAL TIME

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:39.465
BECAUSE KIDS DON'T GET TO

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:41.033
OVERSEE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.868
WAIT. FOR A SLOW CULTURE SHIFT

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:43.402
TO HAPPEN.

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:45.271
AND.

02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:48.007
TOO MANY KIDS NOT BENEFIT.

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:50.776
TO THE TUNE THEY CAN IF WE WERE

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:52.311
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:53.779
FORMULA.

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:54.613
TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR

GOVERNOR'S SUGGESTION OF TWO

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:04.817
HUNDRED FOURTEEN SAID WHICH I

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:07.252
WITH FURTHER IF YOU ARE. SO FOR

02:07:07.319 --> 02:07:07.853
THAT ITEM THAT IS ISSUE NUMBER

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:08.821
THREE.

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:10.723

BROADER QUESTION FEEL FREE TO

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:21.467
OUR HOUSE THAT NOW IF NOT A NEW

02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:22.768
IDEA THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.303
HAVE IS JUST THE. AVERAGE DAILY

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:26.105
ATTENDANCE.

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.039
PLEASE OUT HOW THE HELL DOES

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:29.675
THAT FACTOR INTO. OF THE THE.

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:30.376
L. CFF.

02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:31.744
.

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.278
HOUSE AWAITED.

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:35.080
A.

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:39.151
I AM GOING TO.

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:40.953
ANSWER I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.355
BUT PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M A

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:45.791
IF I'M NOT GETTING QUITE IT

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:48.260
LATER ASKING. A SO L. CFF IS

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.362
FIRST BASED ON A SERIES OF

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:51.330
WEIGHTS.

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:52.865
BY GRADE SPAN

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:54.133
SO THEREFORE GRADE SPANS THAT

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:56.101
EACH.

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:58.070
GENERATE UNIQUE BASE RATES

02:07:58.137 --> 02:08:00.806
GENERALLY THE HIGHER GRADES.

02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:02.007
EARNERS.

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:04.109
LARGER WAIT IN THE LOWER GRADES

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:05.711
AND THIS.

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:08.047
BASE RATE IS GENERATED PER UNIT

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:10.816
OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SO.

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:12.484
THAT IS TO SAY.

02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:14.219
NOT ONLY HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE

02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:15.754
SHOWING UP BUT HOW FREQUENTLY

02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:17.923
ARE THEY ATTENDING SCHOOL SO WE

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:20.125
WE TAKE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:21.326
TIMES THOSE BASE RATES AND

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:23.729
THAT'S HOW WE. WE CALCULATE

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:25.197
BASICALLY ALSO. IN AND ARE WE

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:29.034
SEEING IN ATTENDANCE LEVELING.

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:30.169
I AND I THINK THE ISSUE MIGHT

02:08:30.235 --> 02:08:32.071
BEGINNING AT TOTAL ATA AND HOW

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:33.839
THE GUARANTEE IS AFFECTED BY

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:34.973
EIGHT YES SO WE KNOW THAT I'LL

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.041
SEE IF I FOR THE PER STUDENT

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:37.309
FORMULA.

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:38.210
ABA.

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:39.912
AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAVE

02:08:39.978 --> 02:08:41.146
SOME PRELIMINARY DATA K. TWELVE

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:42.581
EIGHTY HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR A

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:44.516
NUMBER OF YEARS OUR OFFICE IT

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:45.818
EXPECTS THAT TO CONTINUE

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:47.453
DECLINING.

02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:49.054
FINANCE HAS A SLIGHT PICKUP IN

02:08:49.121 --> 02:08:50.122
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT'S AN

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.124
ASSUMPTION IF IT WILL BE WHAT IT

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:54.460
WILL BE AND IF IT COMES ON LOWER.

02:08:54.526 --> 02:08:55.494
THAT THE THING IS ONCE YOU

02:08:55.561 --> 02:08:57.796
ESTABLISH YOUR SPENDING LEVEL.

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.231
WHICH IS TYPICALLY LINKED TO

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:01.500
YOUR ABA ASSUMPTION YOU EITHER

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:03.435
OVER OR UNDER SHOT.

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:05.204
SO OUR CONCERN FOR OLD A FEW

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:06.638
WEEKS NOW HAS BEEN THAT YOU'RE

02:09:06.705 --> 02:09:08.240
LIKELY OVER SHOOTING A LITTLE

02:09:08.307 --> 02:09:10.008
BIT BECAUSE OUR ETA LAST MONTH

02:09:10.075 --> 02:09:10.943
AS LOWER.

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:13.345
SO IF EIGHTY A ARM.

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:15.414
IT COMES IN HIGHER.

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:17.182
YOU BUILD OUT YOU HAVE A TWO

02:09:17.249 --> 02:09:18.383
YEAR HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION SO

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.751
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT YOU WILL

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.653
NOT SEE ANY NEED TO CLIMB IN THE

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:24.056
GUARANTEE AND NINETEEN TWENTY.

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:26.125
AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EVEN IF

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:28.327
ABA IN FACT GOES DOWN

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:29.194
BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION HAS US

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:30.562
HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. THE

02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:31.763
COST OF THAT AND EIGHTEEN

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.065
NINETEEN IS MORE THAN FOUR

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:34.666
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:09:34.733 --> 02:09:36.835
THIS IS ALREADY IN YOUR PLANS

02:09:36.902 --> 02:09:37.970
BECAUSE YOU ASSUME THE SLIGHT

03:04:37.299 --> 03:04:39.568
I'D YES IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE

03:04:39.635 --> 03:04:41.603
CITY INCENTIVE GRANT WAS FUNDED

03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:44.573
ON A ONE TIME BASIS WITH A

03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:46.175
MATCHING GRANT REQUIREMENT THAT.

03:04:46.241 --> 03:04:47.910
MATCHING.

03:04:47.976 --> 03:04:49.812
REQUIREMENT.

03:04:49.878 --> 03:04:52.581
CHANGED INTO YEARS IT IT.

03:04:52.648 --> 03:04:54.116
STARTED OUT I BELIEVE IT FIFTY

03:04:54.183 --> 03:04:55.050
FIFTY IN AND DID.

03:04:55.117 --> 03:04:56.452
AT TWO.

03:04:56.518 --> 03:04:57.986
LOOK AT WHAT.

03:04:58.053 --> 03:05:00.389
TWO ONE IS THAT.

03:05:00.456 --> 03:05:01.757
THE PAY A YAWN I THINK WE WOULD

03:05:01.824 --> 03:05:03.725
SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO

03:05:03.792 --> 03:05:05.294
DO SOMETHING BEYOND ALL CFF WITH

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:06.595
CTE AGAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

03:05:06.662 --> 03:05:08.263
DISPOSED TO DO CTE WITHIN HIGH

03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:09.832
SCHOOLS ARE THE HOT DASHBOARD

03:05:09.898 --> 03:05:10.933
MEASURE TO KEEP TRACK OF

03:05:10.999 --> 03:05:12.501
PERFORMANCE IN THAT AREA. IF

03:05:12.568 --> 03:05:13.435
YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:15.270
SPECIAL WITH CTE THAT LOCAL

03:05:15.337 --> 03:05:17.072
COMMITMENT WE THINK WOULD BE

03:05:17.139 --> 03:05:18.740
IMPORTANT SO THAT YOU CONTINUE

03:05:18.807 --> 03:05:19.875
TO BUILD OFF OF THESE THINGS

03:05:19.942 --> 03:05:21.109
AGAIN THAT HAPPENED HAPPENED IN

03:05:21.176 --> 03:05:22.511
THE LAST FEW YEARS. BUT THE

03:05:22.578 --> 03:05:24.546
FINAL POINT HAS OVER THE LAST

03:05:24.613 --> 03:05:25.814
LIKE EIGHT YEARS THE STATE'S

03:05:25.881 --> 03:05:27.649
MAIN NOTABLE INVESTMENTS TO TRY

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:28.917
TO GET COLLEGES AND SCHOOL

03:05:28.984 --> 03:05:32.454
DISTRICTS TO ARTICULATE THEIR

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:34.456
THE STATE HAS. CREATED SEVERAL

03:05:34.523 --> 03:05:35.891
PROGRAMS THAT TRY TO GET

03:05:35.958 --> 03:05:37.493
COLLEGES TO SIT DOWN WITH HIGH

03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:39.294
SCHOOLS TO SAY. LET'S RUN

03:05:39.361 --> 03:05:41.797
PROGRAMS IN THESE AREAS AND

03:05:41.864 --> 03:05:42.698
LET'S COME TO HIGH SCHOOLS RUN

03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:43.665
THE FIRST TWO LEVELS AND

03:05:43.732 --> 03:05:45.467
COLLEGES THE NEXT THREE LEVELS

03:05:45.534 --> 03:05:46.568
BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE

03:05:46.635 --> 03:05:49.137
ARTICULATED AND LEAD TO. AN

03:05:49.204 --> 03:05:49.605
INDUSTRY VALUED SIR TO

03:05:49.671 --> 03:05:50.539
THE CAT.

03:05:50.606 --> 03:05:52.674
SO. I THINK THERE'S A WAY AGAIN

03:05:52.741 --> 03:05:54.376
FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE ALL OF

03:05:54.443 --> 03:05:55.344
THESE EFFORTS THAT IT'S MADE

03:05:55.410 --> 03:05:57.646
OVER THE LAST. ALMOST DECADE TO

03:05:57.713 --> 03:05:59.915
IMPROVE CITY IN THE STATE.

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:01.383
AND THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S WHY

03:06:01.450 --> 03:06:03.151
AM I WANTED YOU TO DISCUSS THAT

03:06:03.218 --> 03:06:04.820
BECAUSE AND. HAVING BEEN A

03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:06.588
NUMBER DISCUSSIONS WITH.

03:06:06.655 --> 03:06:08.323
WHERE WE GOT THE NUMBER FOR?

03:06:08.390 --> 03:06:09.424
FOR THIS PROGRAM.

03:06:09.491 --> 03:06:11.593
.

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:14.196
PARTNERING WITH.

WHEN YOU'RE BACK TO OPEN DRAW

03:06:15.063 --> 03:06:16.431
FUNNY WHEN YOU PARTNER WITH.

03:06:16.498 --> 03:06:18.867

03:06:19.735 --> 03:06:21.803
EDUCATION.

03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:23.705
IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT WE KNOW

03:06:23.772 --> 03:06:24.873
NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE GOING TO GO

03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:26.508
TO BERKELEY.

03:06:26.575 --> 03:06:27.543
THAT SOME CHILDREN ARE GOING TO

03:06:27.609 --> 03:06:29.211
BE GOING INTO CAREERS IN THE

03:06:29.278 --> 03:06:30.812
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEM.

03:06:30.879 --> 03:06:33.181
EARLY ENGAGE IN A CAREER PATH.

03:06:33.248 --> 03:06:34.716
JUNIORS

03:06:34.783 --> 03:06:37.085
SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS.

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:39.154
OUR AND PARTNERING WITH A LOT OF

03:06:39.221 --> 03:06:40.789
THE DIFFERENT TRADES I VISITED

03:06:40.856 --> 03:06:42.624
NUMBER THE TRADE UNIONS WHEN YOU

03:06:42.691 --> 03:06:44.359
TALK TO THE CARPENTERS

03:06:44.426 --> 03:06:46.962
ELECTRICIANS. PIPETTERS THE

03:06:47.029 --> 03:06:49.131
SHEET METAL WORKERS ONE OF THE

03:06:49.197 --> 03:06:50.832
BIGGEST THINGS THEY NEED. AS A

03:06:50.899 --> 03:06:53.135
YOUNGER WORKFORCE THE DEPEND ON

03:06:53.201 --> 03:06:54.336
THE AGENTS ARE LOOKING AT.

03:06:54.403 --> 03:06:56.138
TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY SIX YEAR

03:06:56.204 --> 03:06:57.706
OLD INDIVIDUALS GOING INTO THESE

03:06:57.773 --> 03:06:59.508

JOURNEYMAN BY THE AGE OF.

03:07:09.818 --> 03:07:11.186
TWENTY TO YOU COULD HAVE YOUNG

03:07:11.253 --> 03:07:12.187
PEOPLE MAY BE IN THE MIDDLE

03:07:12.254 --> 03:07:13.622
CLASS.

03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:15.357
AND SO.

03:07:15.424 --> 03:07:16.925
I THINK THIS IS JUST A.

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:19.428
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE

03:07:19.494 --> 03:07:20.762
LOCAL CONTROL FUNNIES DOING

03:07:20.829 --> 03:07:22.230
RELEVANCY.

03:07:22.297 --> 03:07:23.498
OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE

03:07:23.565 --> 03:07:24.700
COMMUNITY.

03:07:24.766 --> 03:07:26.401
ALIGNING WITH OUR CORE

03:07:26.468 --> 03:07:28.103
CURRICULUM.

03:07:28.170 --> 03:07:30.372
WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING IN THE

03:07:30.439 --> 03:07:32.307
DASHBOARD TO ADD THIS AS ELEMENT

03:07:32.374 --> 03:07:33.742
SO IMPACTS LOOK AT IT BECAUSE

03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:35.544
RIGHT NOW YOU SEE WHAT PERCENT

03:07:35.611 --> 03:07:36.578

ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO INTO

03:07:43.952 --> 03:07:45.587
CAREER WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:47.289
MEASUREMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:07:47.356 --> 03:07:48.590
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND INCOME

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:51.927
EQUITY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SO.

03:07:51.994 --> 03:07:53.729

THAT THE RIGHT NUMBER. WE

03:07:58.433 --> 03:08:00.002
ORIGINALLY HAD A PLAN TO HAVE

03:08:00.068 --> 03:08:01.637
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:08:01.703 --> 03:08:04.239

DOLLARS INTO A PROGRAM OVER

03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:19.688
THREE YEARS WHICH WOULD THEN

03:08:19.755 --> 03:08:21.390
HAVE LEGS AND LAST. THING BICU

LOOK AT.

03:08:28.363 --> 03:08:30.465
GOING WITH THIS WE UNDERSTAND

03:08:30.532 --> 03:08:31.900
THAT NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE GOING

03:08:31.967 --> 03:08:33.835
TO BE.

03:08:33.902 --> 03:08:34.603
YOU KNOW FRENCH LITERATURE

03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:37.072

03:08:47.616 --> 03:08:49.718
CLASS JOBS SO.

03:08:49.785 --> 03:08:50.419
IN THE DISCUSSION HAIRLIKE IS AT

03:08:50.485 --> 03:08:52.087
STAKE WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED THAT

03:08:52.154 --> 03:08:54.156
SHOULD BE THE FLOOR WE

03:08:54.222 --> 03:08:54.690
ORIGINALLY REQUESTED FIVE

03:08:54.756 --> 03:08:57.726
HUNDRED.

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:59.027
IF I MAY ON THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:00.295
OUT MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST

03:09:00.362 --> 03:09:01.630
NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED

03:09:01.697 --> 03:09:02.931
FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.766
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ON THEIR

03:09:04.833 --> 03:09:06.535
REGIONAL MODEL THEY ALSO HAD A

03:09:06.601 --> 03:09:07.803
MORE TRADITIONAL MODEL THEY'VE

03:09:07.869 --> 03:09:09.705
MOVED TO THIS REGIONAL MODEL

03:09:09.771 --> 03:09:11.807
BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS.

03:09:11.873 --> 03:09:13.575
MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM

03:09:13.642 --> 03:09:15.777
OFFERINGS ARE LINES TO THE

03:09:15.844 --> 03:09:17.079
WORKFORCE NEEDS OF ANY

03:09:17.145 --> 03:09:19.014
PARTICULAR REGION WE DON'T THINK

03:09:19.081 --> 03:09:20.048
THAT K. TWELVE SHOULD BE OUTSIDE

03:09:20.115 --> 03:09:21.717
OF THAT PROCESS AND WE DON'T

03:09:21.783 --> 03:09:22.818
THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN OUR

03:09:22.884 --> 03:09:24.386
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE

03:09:24.453 --> 03:09:25.887
CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT THAT THE

03:09:25.954 --> 03:09:29.725
ANALYST HAS SUGGESTED.

03:09:29.791 --> 03:09:31.126
I'M GONNA SIR NIELSEN EXPLICIT A

03:09:31.193 --> 03:09:32.327
FOLLOW UP ONE QUICK QUESTION ON

03:09:32.394 --> 03:09:33.695
THAT POINT.

03:09:33.762 --> 03:09:35.097
SO I I DID WANT TO NOTE.

03:09:35.163 --> 03:09:36.732
THE A DISTANT WE HAD SOME

03:09:36.798 --> 03:09:39.534
CONCERNS. REGARDING THE OUR

03:09:39.601 --> 03:09:41.036
REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THIS SEVENTY

03:09:41.103 --> 03:09:43.538
TWO REGIONAL CONSORTIA CREATE A

03:09:43.605 --> 03:09:44.773
K. TWELVE SELECTION COMMITTEE.

03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:46.608
TO DISBURSE FUNDS SO COULD YOU

03:09:46.675 --> 03:09:48.443
ARMY GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON

03:09:48.510 --> 03:09:49.845
THE I THINK THE CONCERN WAS THAT

03:09:49.911 --> 03:09:51.580
IT WAS ANOTHER. LAYER OF

03:09:51.646 --> 03:09:53.482
BUREAUCRACY IN A LOT OF MONEY

03:09:53.548 --> 03:09:56.551
JUST TO. MOVE MONEY.

03:09:56.618 --> 03:09:58.620
AMBER ALEXANDER WHAT DEPARTMENT

03:09:58.687 --> 03:09:59.988
CLARIFICATION ON THAT POINT

03:10:00.055 --> 03:10:01.256
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT REGIONAL

03:10:01.323 --> 03:10:03.225
CONSORTIA SO THERETHIS WOULD BE

03:10:03.291 --> 03:10:04.126
HAPPENING I MEAN EIGHT REGIONS

03:10:04.192 --> 03:10:05.527
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE

03:10:05.594 --> 03:10:07.062
SEVENTY TWO FIGURE THAT I

03:10:07.129 --> 03:10:08.130
BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERENCING IS

03:10:08.196 --> 03:10:09.397
THE SEVENTY TWO WORKFORCE

03:10:09.464 --> 03:10:10.632
PATHWAY COORDINATORS WHICH WOULD

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:12.300
BE KIND OF THE REGIONAL

03:10:12.367 --> 03:10:13.635
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS

03:10:13.702 --> 03:10:15.137
WITH IN THOSE REGIONS.

03:10:15.203 --> 03:10:17.005
SO BE EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:19.040
WOULD EACH THE SET UP EIGHT KATE

03:10:19.107 --> 03:10:20.242
FOR SELECTION COMMITTEE SO THERE

03:10:20.308 --> 03:10:20.909
WOULD BE EIGHT SELECTION

03:10:20.976 --> 03:10:21.743
COMMITTEES.

03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:23.545
SO YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN

03:10:23.612 --> 03:10:23.779
THEIR.

03:10:23.845 --> 03:10:25.614
FICKLE THOUGH REALLY IS TO MAKE

03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:27.349
SURE THAT THESE ARE LOCALLY

03:10:27.415 --> 03:10:29.284
DRIVEN DECISIONS AND THAT IS WHY

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:30.652
THEY ARE STRUCTURED THAT WAY

03:10:30.719 --> 03:10:32.420
WITHIN THE EIGHT REGIONS. ON THE

03:10:32.487 --> 03:10:33.855
SELECTION COMMITTEE PURPOSE IS

03:10:33.922 --> 03:10:35.357
TO MAKE SURE THAT KEY TWELVE IS

03:10:35.423 --> 03:10:36.858
REALLY HAVING CONTROL OVER THOSE

03:10:36.925 --> 03:10:38.627
DECISIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS A

03:10:38.693 --> 03:10:40.328
CONCERN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:10:40.395 --> 03:10:42.631
WOULD BE GUIDING AND THE

03:10:42.697 --> 03:10:43.198
DECISIONS BY MOVING TO THIS

GREAT THANK YOU AND ANOTHER

ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS ABOUT

03:11:43.258 --> 03:11:44.159

A REQUIREMENTS THAT BY VIRTUE OF

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:54.269
GETTING EITHER OF THESE POTS OF

03:11:54.336 --> 03:11:55.904
MONEY HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

03:11:55.971 --> 03:11:57.072
YOU NEED TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER

03:11:58.573 --> 03:12:01.276
ARE LINED.

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:02.611
IF I JUST RESPOND TO THAT POINT

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:03.879
AND THERE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN

03:12:03.945 --> 03:12:05.046
THOSE TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS AND

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:06.381
PASSED PROGRAMS IN BOTH CAREER

03:12:06.448 --> 03:12:07.983
PATHWAYS TRUST AND A CT

03:12:08.049 --> 03:12:08.884
INCENTIVE GRANT.

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:10.452
THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:12:10.518 --> 03:12:11.720
ADDRESS THOSE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

03:12:11.786 --> 03:12:13.121
SEEN ANY OUTCOMES FROM THOSE

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:14.990
PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T KNOW IF

03:12:15.056 --> 03:12:15.590
THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN

03:12:15.657 --> 03:12:17.659
SUCCESSFUL AND SO BY BRINGING IT

03:12:17.726 --> 03:12:19.427
TO A REGIONAL LEVEL WE WILL.

03:12:19.494 --> 03:12:21.229
MEAN SEXUALLY FORCE THAT

03:12:21.296 --> 03:12:21.796
CONVERSATION TO BE HAPPENING

03:12:21.863 --> 03:12:22.797
LOCALLY.

03:12:22.864 --> 03:12:23.298
GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:23.832
CLARIFICATION

03:12:23.899 --> 03:12:27.903
SENATOR NIELSEN.

03:12:27.969 --> 03:12:28.837
ON THAT POINT I WOULD ARGUE THAT

03:12:28.904 --> 03:12:29.337
THE.

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:31.306
THE.

03:12:31.373 --> 03:12:33.508
SELECTION COMMITTEE COULD BE AND

03:12:33.575 --> 03:12:35.744
SHOULD BE SCRUTINIZED AS.

03:12:35.810 --> 03:12:36.878
WHETHER IT WORKS VERY WELL OR

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:38.713
NOT. AYE I'M NOT READY TO BUY IN

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:40.615
A FULL TIME.

03:12:40.682 --> 03:12:42.384
BUT I. COULD ACCEPT WERE SET

03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:44.286
RIGHT NOW

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:46.955
I I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT.

03:12:47.022 --> 03:12:48.723
THAT.

03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:51.192
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD NOT.

03:12:51.259 --> 03:12:53.128
THE WE DIRECT MONEY AT THAT THAT

03:12:53.194 --> 03:12:54.529
WHOLE RESTRUCTURING. GAVE ME

03:12:54.596 --> 03:12:56.464
SOME CONCERN.

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:57.499
AND THE MORE LOCAL.

03:12:57.565 --> 03:13:00.702
THE BETTER.

03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:01.903
CAREER TECHS HAD A. KIND OF A

03:13:01.970 --> 03:13:04.339
TORTURED HISTORY.

03:13:04.406 --> 03:13:05.373
SEEMS LIKE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR

03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:07.442
YEARS AGO.

03:13:07.509 --> 03:13:10.278
CRITICS WAS VERY VULNERABLE.

03:13:10.345 --> 03:13:12.914
AND FIVE THOUSAND.

03:13:12.981 --> 03:13:14.482
BLUE AND GOLD JACKET FUTURE

03:13:14.549 --> 03:13:15.050
FARMERS MARCHED HERE ON THE

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:16.851
CAPITOL.

03:13:16.918 --> 03:13:19.120
IT MADE A DIFFERENCE.

03:13:19.187 --> 03:13:21.489
VENDORS CREDIT.

03:13:21.556 --> 03:13:23.358
THE NEXT YEAR THE GOVERNOR.

03:13:23.425 --> 03:13:26.594
STRONGLY SUPPORTED CRITIC AT.

03:13:26.661 --> 03:13:28.129
AND IN FACT HE EXPANDED THE

03:13:28.196 --> 03:13:29.864
INCENTIVE GRANTS.

03:13:29.931 --> 03:13:31.366
TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS.

03:13:31.433 --> 03:13:33.668
IN.

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:36.104
NOT JUST TO PROVOKE AG.

03:13:36.171 --> 03:13:37.906
CAREER TECH MATCH BUT ALSO TO

03:13:37.973 --> 03:13:40.442
THE REST OF CRITICAL.

03:13:40.508 --> 03:13:42.210
IS THERE ANY.

03:13:42.277 --> 03:13:43.845
INCENTIVE GRANT MONEY AS A PART

03:13:43.912 --> 03:13:47.248
OF THIS PARTICULAR PLAN.

03:13:47.315 --> 03:13:47.849
I DON'T THINK THERE IS IS THAT

03:13:47.916 --> 03:13:50.085
RIGHT.

03:13:50.151 --> 03:13:51.519
THIS PROGRAM IS IF SEPARATE FROM

03:13:51.586 --> 03:13:52.520
THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT

03:13:52.587 --> 03:13:53.621
PROGRAM SO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:13:53.688 --> 03:13:54.889
PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE

03:13:54.956 --> 03:13:56.524
EXISTING CITY I THINK GRANT

03:13:56.591 --> 03:13:58.026
PROGRAM TO SUNSET AND. AND

03:13:58.093 --> 03:14:00.028
ESTABLISH THIS NEW PROGRAM

03:14:00.095 --> 03:14:00.895
WITHIN THE STRONG WORKFORCE

03:14:00.962 --> 03:14:02.731
PROGRAM. AND THERE IS I KNOW YOU

03:14:02.797 --> 03:14:03.999
MENTIONED THE AG INCENTIVE

03:14:04.065 --> 03:14:05.300
GRANTS THAT'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM

03:14:05.367 --> 03:14:06.368
SEPARATE AND APART FROM CT

03:14:06.434 --> 03:14:07.602
INCENTIVE GRANT AND WE DO

03:14:07.669 --> 03:14:09.037
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ONGOING

03:14:09.104 --> 03:14:10.605
FUNDING FOR THAT. THAT'S THAT'S

03:14:10.672 --> 03:14:13.842
A SHEPHERD THE. PROVISION IN THE

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:15.643
ANTICOAGULANT TIRE.

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.512
WE GOT A SONG CYCLE.

03:14:17.579 --> 03:14:19.514
SO YOUR CONCEPT THEN IS WITH

03:14:19.581 --> 03:14:21.216
THE MONEY STE.

03:14:21.282 --> 03:14:23.084
DIRECTED HERE MAN.

03:14:23.151 --> 03:14:24.019
THE LOCALS WILL HAVE ENOUGH

03:14:24.085 --> 03:14:25.120
ABILITY.

03:14:25.186 --> 03:14:27.322
THE P. FLEXIBLE.

03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:28.757
AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT NEED THE

03:14:28.823 --> 03:14:29.891
INCENTIVE GRANT IS AT THE THE

03:14:29.958 --> 03:14:32.827
LOGIC.

03:14:32.894 --> 03:14:33.862
I MEAN THAT'S A SEPARATE DEAL

03:14:33.928 --> 03:14:35.130
BUT ITS ALSO PART OF THEIR

03:14:35.196 --> 03:14:37.132
FUNDING STREAM.

03:14:37.198 --> 03:14:39.200
SO BE AND CTS CENTER OF GRANT.

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:40.869
FROM ITS INCEPTION IT WAS IT WAS

03:14:40.935 --> 03:14:42.270
MESSAGED OUT A SHORT TERM

03:14:42.337 --> 03:14:44.439
PROGRAM TRIP TO TRANSITION TELLS

03:14:44.506 --> 03:14:45.540
THE A FAP. AND THE

03:14:45.607 --> 03:14:46.541
ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY CLEAR IN

03:14:46.608 --> 03:14:48.009
THAT WE STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY

03:14:48.076 --> 03:14:48.443
WITH THE.

03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:50.645
DECREASING STATE COMMITMENT AND

03:14:50.712 --> 03:14:52.247
THE INCREASING LOCAL MATCH

03:14:52.313 --> 03:14:52.580
REQUIREMENT.

03:14:52.647 --> 03:14:54.282
SO.

03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:56.184
FROM THE GET GO IT WAS ALWAYS

03:14:56.251 --> 03:14:56.985
ENVISIONED TO BE A THREE YEAR

03:14:57.052 --> 03:14:58.853
PROGRAM. AT THIS PROGRAM WHILE

03:14:58.920 --> 03:14:59.821
IT DOES HAVE SOME OF THE SAME

03:14:59.888 --> 03:15:01.656
ELEMENTS BECAUSE WE DID HERE IN

03:15:01.723 --> 03:15:03.191
THE FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY CTE

03:15:03.258 --> 03:15:04.192
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY

03:15:04.259 --> 03:15:05.860
VALUED IN THE FIELD. WE PULLED A

03:15:05.927 --> 03:15:07.562
LOT OF THOSE ELEMENTS IN THE

03:15:07.629 --> 03:15:08.763
DIFFERENCE REALLY IS THAT OUR

03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:10.732
PROGRAM IS FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY

03:15:10.799 --> 03:15:13.001
ON CTV PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED

03:15:13.068 --> 03:15:15.703
TO REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS AND

03:15:15.770 --> 03:15:16.805
FEEDING INDUSTRY DEMAND AN AREA.

03:15:16.871 --> 03:15:19.240
WELL. I CAN SEE SOME MERIT WITH

03:15:19.307 --> 03:15:21.009
THAT IN THE PART THE REGIONAL

03:15:21.076 --> 03:15:23.545
PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE THE LOCAL

03:15:23.611 --> 03:15:25.080
APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAMS WHICH

03:15:25.146 --> 03:15:27.182
WE COULD DIRECT.

03:15:27.248 --> 03:15:29.084
INDIVIDUALS AND TO. THAT I THINK

03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:30.718
THAT FIT.

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:32.387
I I WOULD ARGUE WHO ALONG WITH

03:15:32.454 --> 03:15:34.055
CENTER MORE LACK FOR EVEN A

03:15:34.122 --> 03:15:35.857
HIGHER COMMITMENT TO PROTECT AT

03:15:35.924 --> 03:15:37.425
I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN.

03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:38.793
CALIFORNIA MORE SO NOW THAN

03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:40.728
BEFORE.

03:15:40.795 --> 03:15:42.297
AND I BRING ANOTHER ASPECT.

03:15:42.363 --> 03:15:43.364
CAREER TECH IT.

03:15:43.431 --> 03:15:46.468
PEOPLE'S ATTENTION.

03:15:46.534 --> 03:15:47.302
CAREER TECH ED.

03:15:47.368 --> 03:15:49.971
STUDENTS.

03:15:50.038 --> 03:15:51.272
DIRECT THEMSELVES AND.

03:15:51.339 --> 03:15:52.874
TRAINED.

03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:54.142
CERTIFIED.

03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:56.811
INTO CAREERS.

03:15:56.878 --> 03:15:58.780
MANY THAT'S A CAREER TOPPER.

03:15:58.847 --> 03:16:01.249
IN THE GREAT CAREERS.

03:16:01.316 --> 03:16:03.151
BUT OTHERS MIGHT WANT TO ASPIRE

03:16:03.218 --> 03:16:04.486
TO DO MORE WITHIN THAT

03:16:04.552 --> 03:16:07.355
PARTICULAR CAREER.

03:16:07.422 --> 03:16:09.691
OR. GO ANOTHER DIRECTION TO

03:16:09.757 --> 03:16:11.426
IMPROVE THEM SELVES AND THEIR

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:14.429
OWN. FUTURE.

03:16:14.496 --> 03:16:15.897
AT AND NOT YOU MENTIONED A BIT

03:16:15.964 --> 03:16:17.599
AGO.

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:18.666
METRIC ARTICULATE AND

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:21.903
MATRICULATE.

03:16:21.970 --> 03:16:24.806
I HAVE LONG. ADVOCATED.

03:16:24.873 --> 03:16:26.975
FOR C. S. YOU AND YOU SEE TO

03:16:27.041 --> 03:16:28.476
EMBRACE.

03:16:28.543 --> 03:16:30.912
CAREER TECH STUDENTS.

03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:32.847
TO ENCOURAGE THAT.

03:16:32.914 --> 03:16:35.283
TO BE AVAILABLE.

03:16:35.350 --> 03:16:37.018
PROGRAMS THAT CSU YOU SEE WOULD

03:16:37.085 --> 03:16:37.685
HOLD.

03:16:37.752 --> 03:16:39.921
FOURTH.

03:16:39.988 --> 03:16:42.190
TO THE CAREER TECH INDIVIDUAL.

03:16:42.257 --> 03:16:43.124
WHO HAS GONE TO THEIR CAREER IN

03:16:43.191 --> 03:16:44.592
THEIR ESTABLISH BUT NOW THEY

03:16:44.659 --> 03:16:46.694
WANT TO DO MORE?

03:16:46.761 --> 03:16:48.096
I THINK SHE ISSUE IS A LITTLE

03:16:48.163 --> 03:16:48.696
BIT INTERESTED IN THAT I DON'T

03:16:48.763 --> 03:16:49.597
THINK.

03:16:49.664 --> 03:16:52.066
YOU SEE AS YET.

03:16:52.133 --> 03:16:53.968
BUT MY POINT IN ALL OF THIS AND

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:04.332
BASED ON PAST RFP PROCESSES TO

03:24:04.398 --> 03:24:06.067
PUT THESE THOUGHTS OUT. ON THEIR

03:24:06.133 --> 03:24:07.902
VARIETY OF FACTORS ONE OF THE

03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:10.304
FACTORS AND THAT WE ARE ARM IS

03:24:10.371 --> 03:24:11.505
MOST CONCERNING TO US IS THAT

03:24:11.572 --> 03:24:13.007
THERE ARE SOME. AREAS OF THE

03:24:13.074 --> 03:24:14.041
STATE THAT WOULD LIKE TO DRAW

03:24:14.108 --> 03:24:15.309
DOWN THESE FUNDS BUT THEY HAVE

03:24:15.376 --> 03:24:16.644
NOT HISTORICALLY HAD THE

03:24:16.711 --> 03:24:17.545
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THE

03:24:17.612 --> 03:24:18.713
INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN NOT JUST

03:24:18.779 --> 03:24:20.348

03:24:25.786 --> 03:24:27.288
REGULATED PROGRAM.

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:28.856
SO EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED TO

03:24:28.923 --> 03:24:30.758
DEVELOP.

03:24:30.825 --> 03:24:32.526
CORRECT IF IT'S FIVE IS NOT YES

03:24:32.593 --> 03:24:34.395
IS COMPLEX APPROPRIATELY FELL

03:24:34.462 --> 03:24:36.030

SEVEN MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE

03:24:40.668 --> 03:24:41.902
REALLY EDUCATION EXPANSION

03:24:41.969 --> 03:24:43.270
PROGRAM WE HAVE PRIORITIZED

03:24:43.337 --> 03:24:44.905
PRIORITIZE LOW ACCESS AREAS OF

03:24:44.972 --> 03:24:46.340
THE STATE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING

03:24:46.407 --> 03:24:47.208
CONVERSATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT

03:24:47.274 --> 03:24:48.542
OF EDUCATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN

03:24:48.609 --> 03:24:50.544
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS GO TO

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:52.246
WHAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD FOR LACK

03:24:52.313 --> 03:24:53.114
OF A BETTER TERM CALL PRESCHOOL

03:24:53.180 --> 03:24:54.615
DESERT'S. UP AND WE KNOW THAT

03:24:54.682 --> 03:24:55.383
THOSE EXIST.

03:24:55.449 --> 03:24:56.717
SPECIFICALLY IN PLACES LIKE

03:24:56.784 --> 03:24:57.852
INLAND EMPIRE.

03:24:57.918 --> 03:25:00.054
IT TO ENSURE THAT YOU WERE

03:25:00.121 --> 03:25:01.756
BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THERE.

03:25:01.822 --> 03:25:03.858
SO THAT THE FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW

03:25:03.924 --> 03:25:04.659
HAVE

03:25:04.725 --> 03:25:05.793
HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO DRAW

03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:07.662
DOWN AT THESE FUNDS.

03:25:07.728 --> 03:25:08.596
AND NO LONGER HAVE A NEED FOR

03:25:08.663 --> 03:25:10.264
THEM AND THAT THEY'RE NOT THE

03:25:10.331 --> 03:25:11.165
ONLY ONES THAT ACTUALLY CAN

03:25:11.232 --> 03:25:12.299
COMPETE FOR THOSE FUNDS SO

03:25:12.366 --> 03:25:14.001
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL TARGET YOUR

03:25:14.068 --> 03:25:16.237
THREE THOUSAND THAT YOU PROVIDE

03:25:16.303 --> 03:25:17.938
FOR IN THE BUDGET.

03:25:18.005 --> 03:25:19.407
SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT

03:25:19.473 --> 03:25:21.075
PART OF EDUCATION ON HOW WE'RE

03:25:21.142 --> 03:25:22.910
GONNA PUT OUT THE ONE TIME FUNDS

03:25:22.977 --> 03:25:24.945
AND. THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT

03:25:25.012 --> 03:25:26.514
THEY HAVE NOT ONLY.

03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:27.982
TEEP PRESCHOOL SLOT THAT THEY

03:25:28.049 --> 03:25:29.483
CAN PROVIDE TO FOLKS WHO ARE NOW

03:25:29.550 --> 03:25:31.652
OPENING UP AND NEWS NEW

03:25:31.719 --> 03:25:33.387
OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS BUT ALSO

03:25:33.454 --> 03:25:34.922
SOME GENERAL CHILDCARE AS WELL.

03:25:34.989 --> 03:25:36.757
SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU WORK

03:25:36.824 --> 03:25:37.958
WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

03:25:38.025 --> 03:25:39.794
WERE NOT ONLY. YOU KNOW BUILDING

03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:41.062
WE'VE THAT ONE TIME FUNDS THE

03:25:41.128 --> 03:25:42.463
CAPACITY TO SERVE KIDS BUT THEY

03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:43.898
WERE SAYING AND BY THE WAY WE'RE

03:25:43.964 --> 03:25:45.066
GONNA PARA WITH SOME ON GOING

03:25:45.132 --> 03:25:46.834
FUNDS FOR SLOTS SO THAT YOU CAN

03:25:46.901 --> 03:25:47.234
UTILIZE.

03:25:47.301 --> 03:25:50.538
THAT INTEREST.

03:25:50.604 --> 03:25:51.272
I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE AN

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:52.606
ADDITIONAL ONE THING THAT WE

03:25:52.673 --> 03:25:54.675
HAVE RAISES THAT THESE NEW SLOTS

03:25:54.742 --> 03:25:56.577
HAVE BEEN GOING TO ELEAZAR

03:25:56.644 --> 03:25:57.745
BECAUSE IT'S A FULL DAY SLOT

03:25:57.812 --> 03:25:59.046
THAT IS USED ENTIRELY WITH

03:25:59.113 --> 03:26:00.514
PROPOSITION NINETY MONEY.

03:26:00.581 --> 03:26:02.283
BUT THERE'S ALSO ELEAZAR AT

03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:03.884
ALSO OFFERS THE PRESCHOOL BUT

03:26:03.951 --> 03:26:05.419
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE

03:26:05.486 --> 03:26:06.087
THE FULL DAY SLOT BECAUSE A FULL

03:26:06.153 --> 03:26:08.456
DAY SLOT FOR A NON ELEAZAR USE

03:26:08.522 --> 03:26:09.590
WITH THE COMBINATION OF

03:26:09.657 --> 03:26:10.691
PROPOSITION NINETY AND ON

03:26:10.758 --> 03:26:12.226
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT.

03:26:12.293 --> 03:26:14.061
SO ONE THING THAT WE SAY IS

03:26:14.128 --> 03:26:15.930
THAT.

03:26:15.996 --> 03:26:17.431
MAYBE ALL OF STATE PRESCHOOL

03:26:17.498 --> 03:26:18.466
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD

03:26:18.532 --> 03:26:20.234
HELP NINE ELLIE IS ALSO ACCESS

03:26:20.301 --> 03:26:22.269
SOME OF THE SPENDING.

03:26:22.336 --> 03:26:24.004
I WOULD SUPPORT THAT.

03:26:24.071 --> 03:26:26.407
FARM IT WILL MORE QUESTION WITH

03:26:26.474 --> 03:26:26.674
REGARD TO.

03:26:26.741 --> 03:26:28.409
.

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:29.810
THIS BECAUSE HE MADE A COMMENT

03:26:29.877 --> 03:26:31.479
WITH REGARD TO A SYSTEM IT IT'S

03:26:31.545 --> 03:26:34.749
NOT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT IT.

03:26:34.815 --> 03:26:35.983
I DON'T MISQUOTE YOU THAT IF THE

03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:39.720
FULLY FUNDED BY GENERAL FUND.

03:26:39.787 --> 03:26:40.721
COULD YOU ELABORATE AND THEN

03:26:40.788 --> 03:26:43.390
TELL ME WHAT.

03:26:43.457 --> 03:26:45.159
WHAT OPTIONS YOU THINK THEY HAVE?

03:26:45.226 --> 03:26:46.460
QUITE SIMPLY CURRENT LAW

03:26:46.527 --> 03:26:48.195

AND THAT WOULD.

03:27:01.175 --> 03:27:02.109
REQUIRE THAT.

03:27:02.176 --> 03:27:03.911
THE LOCALS.

03:27:03.978 --> 03:27:05.146

FIRE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THAT ARE

03:28:35.703 --> 03:28:37.004
NOT.

03:28:37.071 --> 03:28:38.472
FULLY BEING UTILIZED I THINK.

03:28:38.539 --> 03:28:40.841
IT'S BROADLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY

03:28:40.908 --> 03:28:42.009
OUR BUDGETING AND A POLICY

03:28:42.076 --> 03:28:43.410
MAKING.

03:28:43.477 --> 03:28:45.145
JUST HOW IMPORTANT.

03:28:45.212 --> 03:28:48.349
OF A PRESCHOOL IS.

03:28:48.415 --> 03:28:52.319
AND NOT A CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND.

03:28:52.386 --> 03:28:54.722
IT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE DON'T.

03:28:54.788 --> 03:28:57.291
FULLY HAVE A GRASP ON WHAT THE

HAVE SO I AM WONDERING WHY WE'RE

03:29:05.900 --> 03:29:07.902
NOT TARGETING SOME MONEY AT IT?

03:29:07.968 --> 03:29:10.337
LOOKING DEEPER INTO THAT AND

03:29:10.404 --> 03:29:12.539
DEVELOPING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:18.178
PLAN THAT WE CAN PUT INTO EFFECT.

03:29:18.245 --> 03:29:22.683

03:29:28.522 --> 03:29:30.257
PRESCHOOL.

03:29:30.324 --> 03:29:31.859
SLOTS AND IF IF WE WERE AT THE

03:29:31.926 --> 03:29:34.762
POINT THAT WE COULD FULLY FUND.

03:29:34.828 --> 03:29:37.798
THE STATE PRESCHOOL.

03:29:37.865 --> 03:29:39.900
PLACEMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE

03:29:39.967 --> 03:29:42.036
STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE

03:29:42.102 --> 03:29:45.372
HOURS THAT FAMILIES NEED.

03:29:45.439 --> 03:29:47.241
THEN I THINK THIS WOULD BE THE

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:48.842
RIGHT DIRECTION FOR US TO GO IN

03:29:48.909 --> 03:29:51.745
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT YEAR.

03:29:51.812 --> 03:29:52.579
SCHEMES ME SENATE BUDGET YOUR

03:29:52.646 --> 03:29:54.982
NOTED.

03:29:55.049 --> 03:29:57.184
IS THAT THAT WHILE. WELL I THINK

03:29:57.251 --> 03:29:59.320
ALL OF US VALUE.

03:29:59.386 --> 03:30:01.956
THE THAT NOT ONLY THE ROLE OF

03:30:02.022 --> 03:30:02.423
STATE PRESCHOOL BUT.

03:30:02.489 --> 03:30:03.791
.

03:30:03.857 --> 03:30:07.528
ITS OFFERINGS.

03:30:07.594 --> 03:30:09.730
IT'S NOW NOT.

03:30:09.797 --> 03:30:11.932
IT'S NOT EVERYWHERE.

03:30:11.999 --> 03:30:13.767
IT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE HOURS.

03:30:13.834 --> 03:30:15.402
AND SO FAMILIES ARE NOT

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:18.072
UTILIZING IT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

03:30:18.138 --> 03:30:19.573
PROVIDED IT ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:21.842
SO.

03:30:21.909 --> 03:30:23.143
IN THIS INTERIM I THINK WE NEED

03:30:23.210 --> 03:30:25.746
TO.

03:30:25.813 --> 03:30:28.115
STEP BACK FROM THAT PERHAPS GET

03:30:28.182 --> 03:30:29.283

BLOOM IS REQUESTED.

03:30:31.285 --> 03:30:33.654
BRITTANY BUT IN THIS INTERIM

03:30:33.721 --> 03:30:35.289
RATHER THAN TRYING TO DIRECT

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:37.458
MORE MONEY TO STAY PRESCHOOL

03:30:37.524 --> 03:30:39.393
BEFORE WE FULLY FIGURED OUT. HOW

03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:41.362
TO ADEQUATELY

03:30:41.428 --> 03:30:41.862
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S?

03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:43.297
?

03:30:43.364 --> 03:30:45.032
THE SLOTS ARE GETTING TAKEN UP

03:30:45.099 --> 03:30:46.900
IN PROVIDING FOR ENOUGH KIDS.

03:30:46.967 --> 03:30:48.635
WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THE KIDS

03:30:48.702 --> 03:30:50.637
IN THE WAYS THAT WE KNOW.

03:30:50.704 --> 03:30:52.206
THERE UTILIZING WHICH IS

03:30:52.272 --> 03:30:53.941
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WHAT WILL

03:30:54.008 --> 03:30:55.876
DISCUSS IN ITEM FIVE.

03:30:55.943 --> 03:30:56.643
SO.

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:58.278
THAT'S WHERE I AM MORE

03:30:58.345 --> 03:30:59.213
COMFORTABLE WITH THIS SENATE'S

03:30:59.279 --> 03:31:01.081
APPROACH.

03:31:01.148 --> 03:31:03.884
ON THE STATE PRESCHOOL SIDE.

03:31:03.951 --> 03:31:05.652
NOW I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER

03:31:05.719 --> 03:31:06.487
QUESTIONS THOUGH THAT ARE ON

03:31:06.553 --> 03:31:08.455
OTHER ITEMS OF THIS FIRST.

03:31:08.522 --> 03:31:10.791
IT'S REFLECTED IN OUR MATERIALS

03:31:10.858 --> 03:31:13.360
THAT.

03:31:13.427 --> 03:31:15.796
A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR SCHOOL

03:31:15.863 --> 03:31:17.097
DISTRICTS ARE NOW OFFERING FULL

03:31:17.164 --> 03:31:19.033
TIME.

03:31:19.099 --> 03:31:20.667
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT IT

03:31:20.734 --> 03:31:21.769
ALSO INDICATES THAT THERE'S

03:31:21.835 --> 03:31:23.203
ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR

03:31:23.270 --> 03:31:25.239
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. MIGHT NOT

03:31:25.305 --> 03:31:27.374
BUT THE.

03:31:27.441 --> 03:31:28.809
THE THE WAY THE MATERIALS ARE

03:31:28.876 --> 03:31:30.444
PRESENTED IS THAT WE DON'T NEED

03:31:30.511 --> 03:31:32.246

03:31:45.993 --> 03:31:46.794
THE DATA ON WHAT SCHOOL

03:31:46.860 --> 03:31:48.295
DISTRICTS AREN'T

03:31:48.362 --> 03:31:49.263
BECAUSE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

03:31:49.329 --> 03:31:50.664
IS THAT IT'S

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:52.166
TENCH LEAVE THOSE SCHOOL

IN SO THAT'S.

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:09.283
BEFORE I CAN ACCEPT THAT WE

03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:11.452
DON'T NEED TO EXTEND THIS JUST

03:32:11.518 --> 03:32:12.886
BECAUSE TWENTY PERCENT OF

03:32:12.953 --> 03:32:14.555
DISTRICTS MAY NOT. BE ARE THE

03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:17.124

03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:32.506
RECEIVING IT MIGHT THIS IN MY

03:32:32.573 --> 03:32:34.308
OFFICE IS THAT.

03:32:34.374 --> 03:32:37.144
BETWEEN COST OF LIVING INCREASES

03:32:37.211 --> 03:32:39.012
AND OF COURSE THE LEGITIMATE

03:32:39.079 --> 03:32:40.881
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES NOT ONLY

03:32:40.948 --> 03:32:42.749
THAT THE STATE HAS APPROVED BUT

03:32:42.816 --> 03:32:44.384
SOME OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

03:32:44.451 --> 03:32:45.619

WHERE THEY CAN'T KEEP UP.

03:32:54.128 --> 03:32:55.863
AND

03:32:55.929 --> 03:32:57.831
WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THERE'S

03:32:57.898 --> 03:33:00.200
POTENTIALLY UP TO A THIRD OF THE

03:33:00.267 --> 03:33:01.602
OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN

03:33:01.668 --> 03:33:03.170
THE STATE. THAT WOULD NOT BE

03:33:03.237 --> 03:33:05.272
ABLE TO CONTINUE.

03:33:05.339 --> 03:33:07.708

03:35:37.024 --> 03:35:38.225
ROCKY TERMS ON A STRIP.

I'VE MADE THIS STATEMENT BEFORE

03:36:00.647 --> 03:36:03.450
IN THE MILITARY.

PARENTS ARE PROBABLY WORKING

03:36:09.056 --> 03:36:10.991
PARENTS ARE DEPLOYED.

03:36:11.058 --> 03:36:12.459

ALL THE THINGS THAT KIDS GO

03:36:16.063 --> 03:36:16.697
THROUGH.

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:19.232

03:36:19.299 --> 03:36:20.167
BUT DOES CHILDREN ARE THE

03:36:20.233 --> 03:36:21.601
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE SCHOOL DIST

OLD AND SEEING THE LIGHT SWITCH

03:38:09.042 --> 03:38:10.310
THAT TURNS ON INSIDE OF HIM THAT

03:38:10.377 --> 03:38:11.311
HAPPENS WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:12.779

03:38:55.455 --> 03:38:56.656
ARE ZERO THREE FIVE.

03:38:56.723 --> 03:38:59.125
SMALLER THE EDUCATION WE THINK

03:38:59.192 --> 03:39:00.160
THAT'S A GOOD START.

03:39:00.227 --> 03:39:02.128
AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE

03:39:02.195 --> 03:39:03.196
CAN DO IN TERMS OF INCREASING

03:39:03.263 --> 03:39:03.964
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THOSE

03:39:04.030 --> 03:39:05.765
FUNDS.

03:39:07.801 --> 03:39:08.869
VARIATIONS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

03:39:08.935 --> 03:39:10.570
AMONGST THE.

03:39:10.637 --> 03:39:12.706
INLAND EMPIRE I'M SURE WE HAVE

03:39:12.772 --> 03:39:14.307
SOME OF THOSE DESERT'S WITHIN

03:39:14.374 --> 03:39:16.042
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AND

03:39:16.109 --> 03:39:17.143
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE FUNDS

03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:18.044
ARE BEING DIRECTED WHERE WE HAVE

03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:19.980
THE GREATEST.

03:39:20.046 --> 03:39:21.948
THE PRIORITY AND THAT'S PROVIDED

03:39:22.015 --> 03:39:23.016
IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR

03:39:23.083 --> 03:39:24.885
THAT PROGRAM DOES PRIORITIZE

03:39:24.951 --> 03:39:26.586
WHAT WE WOULD CALL LOW ACCESS

03:39:26.653 --> 03:39:27.521
AREAS.

03:39:27.587 --> 03:39:29.422
AND DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT

03:39:29.489 --> 03:39:31.091
EDUCATION TO LOOK AT DATA THAT'S

03:39:31.157 --> 03:39:32.492
COLLECTED BY LOCAL CONTROL A

03:39:32.559 --> 03:39:33.894
SITE LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS.

03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:35.362
WHICH

03:39:35.428 --> 03:39:37.097
THAT HAVE THIS DATA I'M TO

03:39:37.163 --> 03:39:38.598
ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE

03:39:38.665 --> 03:39:39.232
PRIORITIZED TOWARDS THOSE LORAX

03:39:39.299 --> 03:39:41.434
LISTENERS.

03:39:41.501 --> 03:39:42.435
I'M AT MY LAST TWO CENTS HERE

03:39:42.502 --> 03:39:44.204
BUT RURAL CALIFORNIA TENDS TO

03:39:44.271 --> 03:39:45.372
GET FORGOTTEN IN THESE

03:39:45.438 --> 03:39:47.040
DISCUSSIONS AND.

03:39:47.107 --> 03:39:47.574
MY HOPE.

03:39:47.674 --> 03:39:48.942
WE CAN MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES

03:39:49.009 --> 03:39:49.376
ARE HEARD HERE TO.

03:39:49.442 --> 03:39:54.514
THINK.

03:39:54.581 --> 03:39:57.417
THANK YOU ON I I DID WANT TO

03:39:57.484 --> 03:39:58.685
FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR SCARES

03:39:58.752 --> 03:39:59.619
POINT AROUND A FULL DAY

03:39:59.686 --> 03:40:02.022
KINDERGARTEN. WHO ARE CURRENTLY

03:40:02.088 --> 03:40:04.157
AND WE FUND FULL DAY

03:40:04.224 --> 03:40:06.760
KINDERGARTEN IS NOT CORRECT?

03:40:06.826 --> 03:40:07.694
I MEAN I I'M SORRY.

03:40:07.761 --> 03:40:09.029
.

03:40:09.095 --> 03:40:11.097
I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS HOW

03:40:11.164 --> 03:40:11.431
DO WE FUNDED.

03:40:11.498 --> 03:40:13.600
.

03:40:13.667 --> 03:40:15.835
I. DON'T NO MY QUESTION IS IS.

03:40:15.902 --> 03:40:19.205
.

03:40:19.272 --> 03:40:21.841
DOES EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT.

03:40:21.908 --> 03:40:23.476
WHETHER THEY OFFER FULL DAY OR

03:40:23.543 --> 03:40:24.844
HALF DAY KINDERGARTEN GET THE

03:40:24.911 --> 03:40:26.379
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY PER STUDENT

03:40:26.446 --> 03:40:28.682
THAT'S.

03:40:28.748 --> 03:40:30.617
SO EVERY DISTRICT REGARDLESS OF

03:40:30.684 --> 03:40:31.484
HOW MANY HOURS THEY'RE BEING

03:40:31.551 --> 03:40:33.486
OFFERED IS BEING PAID THE SAME.

03:40:33.553 --> 03:40:35.822
THAT'S CORRECT. ON SO FOR TWENTY

03:40:35.889 --> 03:40:38.091
FIVE PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS.

03:40:38.158 --> 03:40:40.460
THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE THE

03:40:40.527 --> 03:40:41.995
MONEY FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

03:40:42.062 --> 03:40:43.229
BUT NOT OFFER FULL TO CAN CARD

03:40:43.296 --> 03:40:45.065
IS THAT CORRECT.

03:40:45.131 --> 03:40:46.600
IF THAT'S SO I GUESS MIKE MY

03:40:46.666 --> 03:40:48.301
QUESTION IS IS ON.

03:40:48.368 --> 03:40:51.137
GIVEN THE SITUATION THE HOUSES

03:40:51.204 --> 03:40:53.173
BOTH DELEO AND FINANCIAL BE.

03:40:53.239 --> 03:40:54.341
CUT THOSE DISTRICTS THE TWENTY

03:40:54.407 --> 03:40:55.775
FIVE PERCENT THAT OFFER AREN'T

03:40:55.842 --> 03:40:57.210
OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN.

03:40:57.277 --> 03:41:00.380
OR DO WE NEED TO DO SOME

03:41:00.447 --> 03:41:01.214
AUGMENTATION SO THAT THEY CAN

03:41:01.281 --> 03:41:02.949
OFFER FOLLICULAR.

03:41:03.016 --> 03:41:03.750
AND SO WE DID.

03:41:03.817 --> 03:41:05.819
.

03:41:05.885 --> 03:41:06.453
RIGHT.

03:41:06.519 --> 03:41:08.822
SMALL REPORT ON THIS ISSUE.

03:41:08.888 --> 03:41:11.458
IN FEBRUARY THEY QUESTION BEING

03:41:11.524 --> 03:41:13.526
WHAT ARE THE COST DIFFERENCES

03:41:13.593 --> 03:41:14.861
BETWEEN FULL THEN PARTY PROGRAMS

03:41:14.928 --> 03:41:16.663
WE FOUND. ACTUALLY RATHER

03:41:16.730 --> 03:41:18.164
SURPRISINGLY THAT THERE AREN'T

03:41:18.231 --> 03:41:19.099
THAT SIGNIFICANT COST

03:41:19.165 --> 03:41:20.166
DIFFERENCES THIS

03:41:20.233 --> 03:41:22.035
MIGHT BE A LITTLE SURPRISING BUT

03:41:22.102 --> 03:41:23.903
IF YOU'D BREAK DOWN WHATARE THE

03:41:23.970 --> 03:41:25.639
COST ELEMENTS IN A KINDERGARTEN

03:41:25.705 --> 03:41:26.673
PROGRAM.

03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:28.074
A LOT OF THEM ARE THINGS LIKE.

03:41:28.141 --> 03:41:29.809
.

03:41:29.876 --> 03:41:31.578
CLASSROOM SPACE MATERIALS

03:41:31.645 --> 03:41:33.480
ADMINISTRATION WHICH ARE ARE

03:41:33.546 --> 03:41:35.448
ALREADY SPREAD ACROSS A NUMBER

03:41:35.515 --> 03:41:36.383
OF CHILDREN.

03:41:36.449 --> 03:41:38.218
OFTENTIMES OVER A NUMBER OF

03:41:38.284 --> 03:41:40.820
YEARS ON A PER CHILD BASIS.

03:41:40.887 --> 03:41:42.288
THEY'RE NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT

03:41:42.355 --> 03:41:44.190
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COST IS THE

03:41:44.257 --> 03:41:44.891
COST OF THE TEAM

03:41:44.958 --> 03:41:46.826
SALARY.

03:41:46.893 --> 03:41:49.362
SO YOU'D SAY THEORETICALLY.

03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:50.864
PART DAY PROGRAM COULD BE

03:41:50.930 --> 03:41:53.333
SAVING A LOT OF MONEY IF IT WERE

03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:54.834
I'M PAYING ITS PARTY TEACHERS

03:41:54.901 --> 03:41:57.070
LESS IF IT WAS EMPLOYING THEM.

03:41:57.137 --> 03:41:59.139
ON A PART TIME BASIS OR IF THEIR

03:41:59.205 --> 03:42:01.007
PARTY TEACHERS WERE TEACHING TWO

03:42:01.074 --> 03:42:02.942
CLASSES PER DAY HOWEVER WE FIND

03:42:03.009 --> 03:42:04.611
THAT THE FIRST TWO OPTIONS ARE

03:42:04.678 --> 03:42:06.446
EXCEEDINGLY RARE IT IT'S RARE

03:42:06.513 --> 03:42:07.981
FOR TEACHERS TO BE EMPLOYED ON A

03:42:08.048 --> 03:42:09.282
PART TIME BASIS OR TO BE PAID

03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:10.517
BLESSED.

03:42:10.583 --> 03:42:12.385
IF THE INSTRUCTOR PARTLY BECAUSE

03:42:12.452 --> 03:42:13.253
FROM AND IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST

03:42:13.319 --> 03:42:15.555
STATE LAW TERRIERS FINE HAVING

03:42:15.622 --> 03:42:17.123
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. SO CD WAS

03:42:17.190 --> 03:42:18.658
CONTRACTED TO DO A STUDY OF

03:42:18.725 --> 03:42:20.193
EXACTLY THAT QUESTION IN THEIR

03:42:20.260 --> 03:42:21.027
SURVEY.

03:42:21.094 --> 03:42:24.097
RESPONSES INDICATED THAT AMONG.

03:42:24.164 --> 03:42:26.566
DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY

03:42:26.633 --> 03:42:28.601
OFFERING PARTY PROGRAM MOST OF

03:42:28.668 --> 03:42:30.136
THEM ARE INTERESTED IN OFFERING

03:42:30.203 --> 03:42:32.472
A FULL DAY PROGRAM. OF BUT MOST

03:42:32.539 --> 03:42:35.208
CITE A LACK OF FACILITY SPACES

03:42:35.275 --> 03:42:37.177
THEIR PRIMARY BARRIER.

03:42:37.243 --> 03:42:39.045
SO BASED ON THAT CD STUDY THEY

03:42:39.112 --> 03:42:39.979
FOUND THAT.

03:42:40.046 --> 03:42:42.282
THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR SO

03:42:42.348 --> 03:42:44.084
ROUGH PREFER PERCENT OF.

03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:45.151
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT.

03:42:45.218 --> 03:42:47.320
DON'T OFFER FULLY CONCURRENT

03:42:47.387 --> 03:42:47.954
THEY WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IF

03:42:48.021 --> 03:42:50.190
THEY HAD. SOME SUPPORTING TO

03:42:50.256 --> 03:42:51.391
BUILD OUT FACILITIES SO HE WAS A

03:42:51.458 --> 03:42:51.758
LACK OF CROSS.

03:42:51.825 --> 03:42:53.426
THAT'S CORRECT.

03:42:53.493 --> 03:42:55.829
FINANCE.

03:42:55.895 --> 03:42:58.565
AND WE BELIEVE THE ANALYST HAS.

03:42:58.631 --> 03:43:00.633
ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED AND SOME

03:43:00.700 --> 03:43:03.937
ISSUES AROUND FULL DAY.

03:43:04.003 --> 03:43:07.674
OKAY SO. WOULD YOU. DO THINK WE

03:43:07.741 --> 03:43:09.275
BETTER OFF OFFERING MONEY FOR

03:43:09.342 --> 03:43:10.744
FACILITIES TO GET THE FULL DAY

03:43:10.810 --> 03:43:12.879
OR SHOULD WE.

03:43:12.946 --> 03:43:13.780
CUT THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DOES

03:43:13.847 --> 03:43:14.981
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR THAT WE'RE

03:43:15.048 --> 03:43:17.917
GIVING. DISTRICTS MONEY.

03:43:17.984 --> 03:43:19.385
AND THAT THEY'RE NOT OFFERING

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:21.488
THAT SERVICE.

03:43:21.554 --> 03:43:22.689
I THINK THE ELSES RAISED A GOOD

03:43:22.756 --> 03:43:23.490
POINT WITCHES.

03:43:23.556 --> 03:43:26.126
AND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS

03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:27.861
PEOPLE ARE THE COST

03:43:27.927 --> 03:43:29.195
AND EVEN FOR THE SCHOOL

03:43:29.262 --> 03:43:30.964
DISTRICTS WHO ARE NOT OFFERING A

03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:32.799
FULL DAY THEIR COST STRUCTURE IS

03:43:32.866 --> 03:43:34.768
REALLY NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.

03:43:34.834 --> 03:43:36.536
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE

03:43:36.603 --> 03:43:38.505
A SIMILAR APPROACH TO BOTH

03:43:38.571 --> 03:43:40.940
PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN WHICH.

03:43:41.007 --> 03:43:42.408
THESE AREAS THAT THE STATE WORD

03:43:42.475 --> 03:43:44.077
THESE ARE BEING OFFERED THERE

03:43:44.144 --> 03:43:45.745
ARE.

03:43:45.812 --> 03:43:47.480
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES SOMETIMES

03:43:47.547 --> 03:43:48.615
REAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES LIKE

03:43:48.681 --> 03:43:49.315
FACILITIES OTHER TIMES IT

03:43:49.382 --> 03:43:50.784
STAFFING.

03:43:50.850 --> 03:43:52.986
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE

03:43:53.052 --> 03:43:54.954
REDUCING THE THE FUNDING AMOUNT

03:43:55.021 --> 03:43:58.892
WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT.

03:43:58.958 --> 03:43:59.526
THE DISTANCE LIKE THIS THERE'S

03:43:59.592 --> 03:44:00.727
UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT THAT

03:44:00.794 --> 03:44:02.695
ACTUALLY. PROVIDING

03:44:02.762 --> 03:44:04.397
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT MIGHT.

03:44:04.464 --> 03:44:04.964
BAGHDAD AND THAT TWENTY FIVE

03:44:05.031 --> 03:44:09.903
PERCENT.

03:44:09.969 --> 03:44:12.839
YES.

03:44:12.906 --> 03:44:15.775
THANK YOU. SERVICE CLERK.

03:44:15.842 --> 03:44:16.075
THANK YOU.

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:21.247
CONFERENCE

03:44:21.314 --> 03:44:23.116
CHAIR FOR TAG FURTHER ASKING

03:44:23.183 --> 03:44:24.884
THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WAS.

03:44:24.951 --> 03:44:27.287
LESS.

03:44:27.353 --> 03:44:28.922
SPECIFIC IN MY COMMENTS ENACT

03:44:28.988 --> 03:44:30.824
ITS IT.

03:44:30.890 --> 03:44:32.759
DOZEN OUR MATERIALS POINT OUT

03:44:32.826 --> 03:44:33.026
THAT THE.

03:44:33.092 --> 03:44:34.928
.

03:44:34.994 --> 03:44:37.497
BELIAU IS REYES THAT.

03:44:37.564 --> 03:44:37.864
THE.

03:44:37.931 --> 03:44:40.066
THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE RATE

03:44:40.133 --> 03:44:41.868
DIFFERENTIAL.

03:44:41.935 --> 03:44:43.536
THE LACK OF A RATE DIFFERENTIAL

03:44:43.603 --> 03:44:45.104
WAS NOT INCENTIVIZING SCHOOL

03:44:45.171 --> 03:44:47.106
DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE PARDEE OVER

03:44:47.173 --> 03:44:49.542
FULL DAY. AND THAT'S THE ADDING

03:44:49.609 --> 03:44:51.578
A HIGHER RATE ACROSS THE BOARD

03:44:51.644 --> 03:44:53.479
WOULD SIMPLY JUST PROVIDED VOTE

03:44:53.546 --> 03:44:56.549

NECESSARILY ADDRESS WIRED TWENTY

03:45:04.591 --> 03:45:06.626
PERCENT ART BUT I THINK THAT'S

03:45:06.693 --> 03:45:08.261
REALLY THE ISSUE IS WISER TWENTY

03:45:08.328 --> 03:45:09.762
PERCENT NOT.

03:45:09.829 --> 03:45:12.632

03:48:42.108 --> 03:48:43.276
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRE

03:48:43.342 --> 03:48:45.111
KINDERGARTEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL

03:48:45.178 --> 03:48:46.679
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT SERVE

03:48:46.746 --> 03:48:48.514
CHILDREN PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN

03:48:48.581 --> 03:48:48.981
ONE THIS TRANSITIONAL

03:48:49.048 --> 03:48:51.117
KINDERGARTEN I BELIEVE ARE THE

03:48:51.184 --> 03:48:53.186
MOST RECENT ESTIMATES SHOW THAT

03:48:53.252 --> 03:48:55.054
AT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN.

03:48:55.121 --> 03:48:56.656
ETA IS SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY

03:48:56.722 --> 03:48:57.690
THOUSAND.

03:48:57.757 --> 03:49:00.560
WE ALSO HAVE STATE PRESCHOOL.

03:49:00.626 --> 03:49:01.794

LEVER ON HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:49:03.096 --> 03:49:04.797
THOUSAND CHILDREN ON I BELIEVE

03:49:04.864 --> 03:49:07.300
ACTUAL ATTENDANCE IS A LITTLE

03:49:07.366 --> 03:49:09.202
BIT CLOSER TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND.

03:49:09.268 --> 03:49:10.970
THERE'S ALSO HEAD START AS A

03:49:11.037 --> 03:49:12.438
FEDERAL PROGRAM.

03:49:12.505 --> 03:49:14.173
AND THEY'RE NOT GREAT RECENT

03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:15.408
NUMBERS ON THE NUMBER OF

03:49:15.475 --> 03:49:17.143
CHILDREN THAT ARE SERVED AT OUR

03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:19.078
OF PRESCHOOL AGE IN HEAD START.

03:49:19.145 --> 03:49:21.047
BUT IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN

03:49:21.114 --> 03:49:22.315
THE REALM OF ABOUT A HUNDRED

03:49:22.381 --> 03:49:24.083
THOUSAND.

03:49:24.150 --> 03:49:25.151
AND THE ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T

03:49:25.218 --> 03:49:27.120
TELL IS TO WHAT EXTENT THERE IS

03:49:27.186 --> 03:49:28.754
OVERLAP.

03:49:28.821 --> 03:49:30.223
BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO BENEFIT

03:49:30.289 --> 03:49:31.891
FROM MULTIPLE PROGRAMS WE KNOW

03:49:31.958 --> 03:49:35.428
THAT I'M A CHILD WHO'S AT THAT

03:49:35.495 --> 03:49:36.963
IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN.

03:49:37.029 --> 03:49:39.031
CAN'T GENERATE FUNDING FOR

03:49:39.098 --> 03:49:40.466
ANOTHER PROGRAM HOWEVER WE DO

03:49:40.533 --> 03:49:42.835
KNOW THAT I MANY PROVIDERS WILL

03:49:42.902 --> 03:49:44.036
BLEND TOGETHER HEAD START AND

03:49:44.103 --> 03:49:45.638
STATE PRESCHOOL FUNDS. TO

03:49:45.705 --> 03:49:47.039
PROVIDE A FULL DAY OF CARE FOR A

03:49:47.106 --> 03:49:48.040
CHILD.

03:49:48.107 --> 03:49:50.276
AS WELL AS STATE PRESCHOOL WITH

03:49:50.343 --> 03:49:51.811
OTHER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS.

03:49:51.878 --> 03:49:53.379
SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US NORTH

03:49:53.446 --> 03:49:55.548
THE OVERLAP IS BUT AT THOSE ARE

03:49:55.615 --> 03:49:56.582
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE NUMBERS

03:49:56.649 --> 03:49:58.417
THAT I I KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY

03:49:58.484 --> 03:49:59.018
HEAD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT LEO

03:49:59.085 --> 03:50:02.955
HAS ANYMORE. AND SPECIFICS.

03:50:03.022 --> 03:50:05.992
A A YOU DON'T COME IT DELEO.

03:50:06.058 --> 03:50:07.393
NO NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY THAT'S

03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:09.028
ALMOST JIM.

03:50:09.095 --> 03:50:10.796
THANK YOU.

03:50:10.863 --> 03:50:12.565
SEE NO.

03:50:12.632 --> 03:50:14.066
FURTHER COMMENTS WILL MOVE ON TO

03:50:14.133 --> 03:50:16.502
ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. CHILDCARE.

03:50:16.569 --> 03:50:18.804
YEAH.

03:50:18.871 --> 03:50:22.508
ISSUE FIVE.

03:50:22.575 --> 03:50:24.010
AIRPORT HAS WITH LA O. SO I'M

03:50:24.076 --> 03:50:25.678
ISSUE FIVE START ON PAGE THIRTY

03:50:25.745 --> 03:50:27.013
EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA AND IT

03:50:27.079 --> 03:50:28.581
BEGINS A DISCUSSION ON BOTH

03:50:28.648 --> 03:50:29.916
HOUSES PLANS FOR CHILD CARE

03:50:29.982 --> 03:50:32.251
SPENDING. NOW BOTH HOUSES PLANS

03:50:32.318 --> 03:50:33.586
INCLUDE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

03:50:33.653 --> 03:50:35.688
AUGMENTATIONS I'M IN THIS AREA

03:50:35.755 --> 03:50:37.223
BUT ALSO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT

03:50:37.290 --> 03:50:38.724
AUGMENTATIONS IN BOTH GENERAL

03:50:38.791 --> 03:50:40.560
AND FEDERAL FUNDS. THE PRIMARY

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:41.527
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

03:50:41.594 --> 03:50:43.529
HOUSES IS THE SENATE INCLUDES IN

03:50:43.596 --> 03:50:44.630
THEIR PLAN TWO HUNDRED AND

03:50:44.697 --> 03:50:45.898
THIRTY TWO MILLION OF RECENTLY

03:50:45.965 --> 03:50:48.234
ALLOCATED OR NEW FEDERAL FUNDS.

03:50:48.301 --> 03:50:54.407
IN THE ASSEMBLY'S OR WE JUMP INTO THE DIFFERENCES

03:50:54.473 --> 03:50:55.942
OF EACH HOUSES PLAN FOR THE

03:50:56.008 --> 03:50:57.109
FEDERAL FUNDS.

03:50:57.176 --> 03:50:58.411
I WOULD NOTE YOU KNOW TWO

03:50:58.477 --> 03:50:59.845
THINGS IN THE FIRST IS THAT THE

03:50:59.912 --> 03:51:01.781
STATE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH

03:51:01.847 --> 03:51:03.249
FEDERAL LAW GOVERNING CHILDCARE.

03:51:03.316 --> 03:51:05.451
WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A PLAN

03:51:05.518 --> 03:51:07.520
ON OR A COST ESTIMATE ABOUT WHAT

03:51:07.587 --> 03:51:08.054
IT WOULD TAKE TO GET IN

03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:10.056
COMPLIANCE. AND THE SECOND IS

03:51:10.122 --> 03:51:11.257
THERE'S NOT CLARITY OF THESE NEW

03:51:11.324 --> 03:51:12.758
FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONE TIME OR

03:51:12.825 --> 03:51:14.527
ONGOING WE LIKELY WON'T HAVE

03:51:14.594 --> 03:51:15.895
CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE FOR

03:51:15.962 --> 03:51:17.363
SEVERAL YEARS.

03:51:17.430 --> 03:51:19.131
OF THE NEW FEDERAL FUNDS BOTH

03:51:19.198 --> 03:51:20.800
HOUSES SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT ON

03:51:20.866 --> 03:51:22.602
CHILDCARE SLOTS.

03:51:22.668 --> 03:51:24.370
THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BEFORE YOU

03:51:24.437 --> 03:51:25.938
IS AT THE SENATE ALLOCATES A

03:51:26.005 --> 03:51:28.107
HUNDRED MORE MILLION TO CD

03:51:28.174 --> 03:51:29.508
SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD GET

03:51:29.575 --> 03:51:30.276
IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL

03:51:30.343 --> 03:51:31.811
REQUIREMENTS ADDED IN TWENTY

03:51:31.877 --> 03:51:33.879
FOURTEEN. THE STATE CURRENTLY

03:51:33.946 --> 03:51:34.914
HAS WAIVERS FOR SOME OF THE

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:36.215
REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE SET TO

03:51:36.282 --> 03:51:37.617
EXPIRE OCTOBER OF TWENTY

03:51:37.683 --> 03:51:38.451
EIGHTEEN.

03:51:38.517 --> 03:51:40.353
THE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION

03:51:40.419 --> 03:51:41.887
IN THE SENATE PLAN CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; WILL&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:51:41.954 --> 03:51:43.356
SUBMIT A PLAN ON HOW THEY WILL

03:51:43.422 --> 03:51:44.690
SPEND THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO

03:51:44.757 --> 03:51:46.425
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND

03:51:46.492 --> 03:51:47.660
THEN WITH SUBMITTED TO THE JOINT

03:51:47.727 --> 03:51:49.462
LEGISLATIVE BY BUDGET COMMITTEE.

03:51:49.528 --> 03:51:51.163
THE REMAINING FUNDS OF THIS ONE

03:51:51.230 --> 03:51:52.632
HUNDRED MILLION NOT USE FOR

03:51:52.698 --> 03:51:53.733
COMPLIANCE WOULD BE USED FOR NEW

03:51:53.799 --> 03:51:55.301
SLOTS.

03:51:55.368 --> 03:51:57.003
SO THE SENATE ALSO USES NEW

03:51:57.069 --> 03:51:58.137
FEDERAL FUNDS TO MEET THE

03:51:58.204 --> 03:51:59.505
REQUIRED MINIMUM QUALITY

03:51:59.572 --> 03:52:01.641
SPENDING LEVEL. AND WITH REGARDS

03:52:01.707 --> 03:52:03.342
TO THE ASSEMBLY PLAN THEIR PLAN

03:52:03.409 --> 03:52:04.610
ALLOCATES FEDERAL FUNDS FOR

03:52:04.677 --> 03:52:05.978
SLOTS THE SAME LEVEL AS THE

03:52:06.045 --> 03:52:07.113
SENATE PLAN.

03:52:07.179 --> 03:52:08.948
AND THEY ALSO SPEND ON THESE

03:52:09.015 --> 03:52:10.182
FEDERAL FUNDS ON A VARIETY OF

03:52:10.249 --> 03:52:12.051
ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS TARGETED

03:52:12.118 --> 03:52:14.820
AT IMPROVING QUALITY OF PROGRAMS.

03:52:14.887 --> 03:52:16.222
IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN LEAVES A

03:52:16.289 --> 03:52:17.657
HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION OF

03:52:17.723 --> 03:52:19.859
THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND SPENT.

03:52:19.925 --> 03:52:20.826
WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE

03:52:20.893 --> 03:52:22.194
SENATE'S PLAN BECAUSE WE THINK

03:52:22.261 --> 03:52:23.529
IT MAKES SENSE TO SET ASIDE

03:52:23.596 --> 03:52:25.264
FUNDING FOR COMPLIANCE.

03:52:25.331 --> 03:52:26.432
WE WOULD RECOMMEND A MOCK A

03:52:26.499 --> 03:52:28.301
MODIFICATION TO THE SENATE PLAN

03:52:28.367 --> 03:52:29.669
INSTEAD OF THE RIVER REMAINDER

03:52:29.735 --> 03:52:30.903
OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION SET

03:52:30.970 --> 03:52:32.805
ASIDE FOR COMPLIANCE AND NOT

03:52:32.872 --> 03:52:34.473
AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO SLOTS IF

03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:35.841
CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; TO SET A DATE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:52:35.908 --> 03:52:37.176
DESIGNATES THAT THEY DON'T NEED

03:52:37.243 --> 03:52:39.345
THIS HUNDRED MILLION. ON THAT IS

03:52:39.412 --> 03:52:40.680
THAT THE FUNDS THEY DON'T

03:52:40.746 --> 03:52:41.647
DESIGNATE THAT THEY NEED FOR

03:52:41.714 --> 03:52:43.182
COMPLIANCE WOULD BE CARRIED OVER

03:52:43.249 --> 03:52:44.784
THROUGH THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR.

03:52:44.850 --> 03:52:45.818
AND WE THINK HEARING THESE FUND

03:52:45.885 --> 03:52:47.053
OVER WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE

03:52:47.119 --> 03:52:49.255
REST OF WHETHER THIS IS ONETIME

03:52:49.322 --> 03:52:50.389
ONGOING FUNDING.

03:52:50.456 --> 03:52:51.023
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

03:52:51.090 --> 03:52:53.592
AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.

03:52:53.659 --> 03:52:54.760
THANK YOU DISCUSSED. THANK YOU I

03:52:54.827 --> 03:52:55.828
JUST KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:52:55.895 --> 03:52:57.196
AREAS OF THE BUDGET WHICH WE'VE

03:52:57.263 --> 03:52:58.497
MADE A RATHER SIGNIFICANT

03:52:58.564 --> 03:52:59.632
INVESTMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH

03:52:59.699 --> 03:53:01.734
THE LEGISLATURE SINCE TWO

03:53:01.801 --> 03:53:02.368
THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE'VE

03:53:02.435 --> 03:53:04.070
INCREASED FUNDING FOR EARLY

03:53:04.136 --> 03:53:05.971
EDUCATION CHILDCARE PROGRAMS BY

03:53:06.038 --> 03:53:07.306
MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO BILLION

03:53:07.373 --> 03:53:08.674
DOLLARS.

03:53:08.741 --> 03:53:10.142
IN THE MAY REVISION WE INCLUDED

03:53:10.209 --> 03:53:11.544
A TOTAL INCREASE OF A HUNDRED

03:53:11.610 --> 03:53:12.812
AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR

03:53:12.878 --> 03:53:14.113
MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR STATE

03:53:14.180 --> 03:53:15.881
SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. FULLY

03:53:15.948 --> 03:53:17.416
FUNDING PRIOR YOUR POLICY

03:53:17.483 --> 03:53:18.951
CHANGES AND RELATED CASELOAD

03:53:19.018 --> 03:53:19.985
INCREASES AGREED TO WITH THE

03:53:20.052 --> 03:53:22.154
LEGISLATURE. WE WOULD KNOW IN

03:53:22.221 --> 03:53:23.389
THE ANNALS HAS TALKED ABOUT THE

03:53:23.456 --> 03:53:24.757
FEDERAL CHILD CARE AND

03:53:24.824 --> 03:53:26.025
DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDS.

03:53:26.092 --> 03:53:27.827
THE TIMING OF THE NOTIFICATION

03:53:27.893 --> 03:53:29.628
OF THE GRANT FUNDS DIDN'T ALIGN

03:53:29.695 --> 03:53:30.596
WITH OUR RELEASE OF THE MAY

03:53:30.663 --> 03:53:32.231
REVISE SO THERE'S A SLIGHT

03:53:32.298 --> 03:53:33.766
DIFFERENCE THERE WE WOULD NOTE

03:53:33.833 --> 03:53:34.800
THAT SUBSEQUENT.

03:53:34.867 --> 03:53:37.002
IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS

03:53:37.069 --> 03:53:37.870
WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE

03:53:37.937 --> 03:53:39.004
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS

03:53:39.071 --> 03:53:40.072
RECEIVED GUIDANCE FROM THE

03:53:40.139 --> 03:53:41.807
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT TO EXPECT

03:53:41.874 --> 03:53:43.809
THESE FUNDS BE ON FEDERAL FISCAL

03:53:43.876 --> 03:53:45.611
YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. SO WE

03:53:45.678 --> 03:53:47.613
WOULD CHEST I KNOW CAUTION IN

03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:49.415
USING THESE FUNDS IN PARTICULAR

03:53:49.482 --> 03:53:51.117
FOR ANY ON GOING PURPOSES BASED

03:53:51.183 --> 03:53:53.819
ON THAT GUIDANCE.

03:53:53.886 --> 03:53:54.320
THANK YOU COMBAT TO THE

03:53:54.387 --> 03:53:54.887
COMMITTEE.

03:53:54.954 --> 03:53:59.258
SOURCE COULD.

03:53:59.325 --> 03:54:01.360
THANK YOU I'M.

03:54:01.427 --> 03:54:02.762
I MEAN THE FEDS ARE JUST LIKE US

03:54:02.828 --> 03:54:04.497
THEY PROVE BUDGET FOR A YEAR BUT

03:54:04.563 --> 03:54:04.697
THERE.

03:54:04.764 --> 03:54:08.901
.

03:54:08.968 --> 03:54:10.669
THAT EXPANSION.

03:54:10.736 --> 03:54:13.773
THE FEDERAL CBGB SPAN XIN.

03:54:13.839 --> 03:54:16.409
IN THAT BASE FUNDING.

03:54:16.475 --> 03:54:17.376
THIS WASN'T THE FIRST YEAR OF IT

03:54:17.443 --> 03:54:20.579
CORRECT.

03:54:20.646 --> 03:54:22.515
SO. I GUESS I'M.

03:54:22.581 --> 03:54:26.952
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:54:27.019 --> 03:54:28.387
ANY FEDERAL MONEY WE HAVE

03:54:28.454 --> 03:54:30.022
WHETHER THEY WARN US OR NOT

03:54:30.089 --> 03:54:31.824
MIGHT TURN INTO ONE TIME.

03:54:31.891 --> 03:54:35.361
BUT GIVEN THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN.

03:54:35.428 --> 03:54:37.463
I'M NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT IT

03:54:37.530 --> 03:54:41.267
BEING PERCEIVED AS ONE TIME ONLY.

03:54:41.333 --> 03:54:43.002
AND I THINK THAT.

03:54:43.068 --> 03:54:46.038
WHATEVER WE CAN USE TO EXPAND

03:54:46.105 --> 03:54:49.375
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE.

03:54:49.442 --> 03:54:52.611
ABLE TO HAVE JOKE HERE WE SHOULD.

03:54:52.678 --> 03:54:54.613
KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW WE FACE A

03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:55.448
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE FOR MANY

03:54:55.514 --> 03:54:57.883
MANY REASONS.

03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:59.285
WHAT I WANTED?

03:54:59.351 --> 03:55:02.721
UNDERSTAND ABOUT.

03:55:02.788 --> 03:55:05.424
THE SENATE'S ACTION ON USING IT

03:55:05.491 --> 03:55:07.426
FOR CD USE.

03:55:07.493 --> 03:55:09.695
HELPING THEM GET INTO COMPLIANCE.

03:55:09.762 --> 03:55:12.031
I DO WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATE FROM

03:55:12.097 --> 03:55:13.299
THEM AS TO WHAT IT'S GOING TO

03:55:13.365 --> 03:55:14.600
TAKE.

03:55:14.667 --> 03:55:16.435
TERM.

03:55:16.502 --> 03:55:18.804
THIS SEEMS LIKE.

03:55:18.871 --> 03:55:20.439
I APPRECIATE WHAT AT RUNNING TO

03:55:20.506 --> 03:55:21.440
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN

03:55:21.507 --> 03:55:23.476
COMPLIANCE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

03:55:23.542 --> 03:55:25.311
THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY

03:55:25.377 --> 03:55:27.379
THAT WE MIGHT. THAT IF WE COULD

03:55:27.446 --> 03:55:29.482
USE.

03:55:29.548 --> 03:55:30.850
MORE OF IT FOR.

03:55:30.916 --> 03:55:32.351
ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE TO

03:55:32.418 --> 03:55:34.520
CHILDREN.

03:55:34.587 --> 03:55:37.723
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SO.

03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:38.357
STRAIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A

03:55:38.424 --> 03:55:43.462
LITTLE BETTER.

WITH CCD BJ.

03:56:09.421 --> 03:56:10.589
BUT THAT IS THE INTENTION OF

03:56:10.656 --> 03:56:12.358
THE SENATE PLAN THAT THEY WOULD

03:56:12.424 --> 03:56:14.360
GO AND MAKE A PLAN FOR WHAT THEY

03:56:14.426 --> 03:56:15.861

LEGISLATURE.

03:56:20.766 --> 03:56:23.736
I'M.

03:56:23.802 --> 03:56:25.905

EVERYBODY ELSE ASK YOU. EARLIER

03:56:33.946 --> 03:56:34.914
GROWTH AWAY I WOULD JUST POINT

03:56:34.980 --> 03:56:35.814
OUT THE PART OF THE THE

03:56:35.881 --> 03:56:36.916
CHALLENGE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT

03:56:36.982 --> 03:56:38.551
THE COSTS ARE IS. IS TRYING TO

03:56:38.617 --> 03:56:40.786
IDENTIFY WHETHER THE WEAVERS

03:56:40.853 --> 03:56:41.854
THAT WE HAVE WILL REMAIN IN

03:56:41.921 --> 03:56:43.455
PLACE MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT

03:56:43.522 --> 03:56:45.024
THE PLAN OR THE EXPECTATIONS ARE

03:56:45.090 --> 03:56:47.126
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR.

03:56:47.192 --> 03:56:49.962
MEET AT BEING A COMPLAINT SO

03:56:50.029 --> 03:56:50.963
WHAT.

03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:52.064
SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE IT WHERE

03:56:52.131 --> 03:56:53.332
THERE'S BEEN THE MOST CONCERNS

03:56:53.399 --> 03:56:54.466
ARE REGARDING. I'M A STAR

03:56:54.533 --> 03:56:56.035
REQUIRING THAT THERE BE ANNUAL.

03:56:56.101 --> 03:56:58.037
EXPERT INSPECTIONS OF LICENSED

03:56:58.103 --> 03:56:59.838
FACILITIES OF THE STATE CURRENT

03:56:59.905 --> 03:57:01.173
DOES SOMETHING MORE LIKE EVERY

03:57:01.240 --> 03:57:03.075
THREE YEARS. AND THEN THERE'S

03:57:03.142 --> 03:57:03.275
ALSO.

03:57:03.342 --> 03:57:04.610
SOME EXPECTATION THAT THERE BE

03:57:04.677 --> 03:57:06.879
SOME VISITING OF LICENSE EXEMPT.

03:57:06.946 --> 03:57:08.314
PROVIDER SO.

03:57:08.380 --> 03:57:09.381
PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING CARE IN

03:57:09.448 --> 03:57:10.616
THEIR HOMES WHO ARE WHO ARE NOT

03:57:10.683 --> 03:57:12.351
LICENSED IN TRYING TO DO SOME

03:57:12.418 --> 03:57:14.086
KIND OF VISIT EVERY YEAR. THAT

03:57:14.153 --> 03:57:16.121
BUT THOSE COSTS COULD BE VERY.

03:57:16.188 --> 03:57:17.489
EXPENSIVE AND WE HAVE A LOT NO

03:57:17.556 --> 03:57:19.224
WEAVER FROM SOMOS REQUIREMENTS

03:57:19.291 --> 03:57:19.925
SO.

03:57:19.992 --> 03:57:20.492
PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF

03:57:20.559 --> 03:57:22.561
FIGURING OUT WHAT THE FEDERAL

03:57:22.628 --> 03:57:23.796
GOVERNMENT WITH THE COULD BE AND.

03:57:23.862 --> 03:57:25.965
INAPPROPRIATE PLAN FOR THE

03:57:26.031 --> 03:57:27.499
STATE AND THEN AFTER THAT WE WE

03:57:27.566 --> 03:57:28.133
COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST

03:57:28.200 --> 03:57:30.135
WOULD BE BUT WITHOUT KNOWING

03:57:30.202 --> 03:57:30.669
EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL

03:57:30.736 --> 03:57:32.037
GOVERNMENT AS A KID WITH A NOT

03:57:32.104 --> 03:57:33.906
IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH

03:57:33.973 --> 03:57:34.940
AN EXACT NUMBERS.

03:57:35.007 --> 03:57:36.442
SEEMS LIKE A VERY IT'S A

03:57:36.508 --> 03:57:38.611
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

03:57:38.677 --> 03:57:38.777
AND.

03:57:38.844 --> 03:57:41.680
.

03:57:41.747 --> 03:57:43.015
I JUST THINK IT'S WE FURTHER

03:57:43.082 --> 03:57:44.984
DELIVERY.

03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:48.821
MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR US TO. TRY

03:57:48.887 --> 03:57:51.857
TO GET THEM TO BE A LITTLE MORE.

03:57:51.924 --> 03:57:53.525
HE WAS A LITTLE FIRMER NUMBERS

03:57:53.592 --> 03:57:56.428
AND IF NOT THEN.

03:57:56.495 --> 03:57:58.497
PROVIDE.

03:57:58.564 --> 03:58:01.934
APPROVED A LOWER AMOUNT.

03:58:02.001 --> 03:58:04.637
IN DIRECT MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE

03:58:04.703 --> 03:58:06.405
TO ACTUALLY HAVE MORE CHILDCARE

03:58:06.472 --> 03:58:08.807
SLOTS IN THEN IF WE NEED TO

03:58:08.874 --> 03:58:13.212
AUGMENTED.

03:58:13.278 --> 03:58:15.381
THAT'S MY. IF I MAY OUT ON TO

03:58:15.447 --> 03:58:18.183
THE ALEJO'S I RESPONSE.

03:58:18.250 --> 03:58:19.585
THAT WE WOULD AGREE THAT THE

03:58:19.652 --> 03:58:21.253
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEN

03:58:21.320 --> 03:58:23.889
AND VERY EXPLICIT AND THERE HAS

03:58:23.956 --> 03:58:25.190
HOW THE INTERPRETING THE

03:58:25.257 --> 03:58:26.925
REQUIREMENTS OF CCTV CHIEF

03:58:26.992 --> 03:58:28.494
FEDERAL REAUTHORIZATION ARE THE

03:58:28.560 --> 03:58:29.662
REAUTHORIZATION OF THE CITY BG.

03:58:29.728 --> 03:58:30.763
NAM WHEN WE'VE DONE COST

03:58:30.829 --> 03:58:32.798
ESTIMATES FOR OURSELVES TO CAN

03:58:32.865 --> 03:58:34.466
LOOK AT THESE COST WE USUALLY

03:58:34.533 --> 03:58:36.035
COME UP WITH A NUMBER AROUND

03:58:36.101 --> 03:58:37.569
THIRTY MILLION FOR.

03:58:37.636 --> 03:58:40.272
ANNUAL LICENSE INSPECTIONS.

03:58:40.339 --> 03:58:41.707
AND WE USUALLY COME UP WITH

03:58:41.774 --> 03:58:43.075
ESTIMATES IN THE LOW TENS OF

03:58:43.142 --> 03:58:44.777
MILLIONS FOR LICENSE EXEMPT

03:58:44.843 --> 03:58:45.878
INSPECTIONS. THAT'S VERY

03:58:45.944 --> 03:58:47.813
DIFFICULT TO KNOW FOR SURE

03:58:47.880 --> 03:58:48.580
HOWEVER.

03:58:48.647 --> 03:58:50.516
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

03:58:50.582 --> 03:58:52.818
ALRIGHT I CAN IMAGINE IT BUT

03:58:52.885 --> 03:58:53.619
YEAH DIFFERENCE

03:58:53.686 --> 03:58:55.320
IN IN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS

03:58:55.387 --> 03:58:57.322
IN THE MAGNITUDE OF FORTY TO

03:58:57.389 --> 03:58:59.792
FIFTY MILLION IN WERE. WE ARE

03:58:59.858 --> 03:59:00.893
HAVE A NIGHT OF THE FORCES

03:59:00.959 --> 03:59:02.394
UPWARDS TO HUNDRED MILLION AND

03:59:02.461 --> 03:59:05.664
SO. WHILE YES IT MAY BE THAT IT

03:59:05.731 --> 03:59:07.399
COSTS MORE THAN THE FORTY TO

03:59:07.466 --> 03:59:10.536
FIFTY YOU'RE DESCRIBING. IF WE.

03:59:10.602 --> 03:59:12.938
IF IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT THEN

03:59:13.005 --> 03:59:14.673
WE EVEN AFFECT TIED UP FIFTY

03:59:14.740 --> 03:59:17.342
MILLION. FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG

03:59:17.409 --> 03:59:19.178
THAT COULD INSTEAD BE USED RIGHT

03:59:19.244 --> 03:59:21.080
AWAY TO HELP FAMILIES AND

03:59:21.146 --> 03:59:22.848
CHILDREN IMMEDIATELY I THINK WE

03:59:22.915 --> 03:59:24.483
WOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH

03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:26.351
USING ANY OF THE MONEY FOR SLICE.

03:59:26.418 --> 03:59:29.455
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR THE NON

03:59:29.521 --> 03:59:31.356
CONTINUANCE OF THE FUNDS IN THE

03:59:31.423 --> 03:59:31.890
GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL

03:59:31.957 --> 03:59:34.026
GOVERNMENT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

03:59:34.093 --> 03:59:34.359
TO.

03:59:34.426 --> 03:59:36.295
YOU KNOW SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE TO

03:59:36.361 --> 03:59:37.730
FAMILIES AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN

03:59:37.796 --> 03:59:40.065
ELIGIBLE FOR THEM. SO WE WOULD

03:59:40.132 --> 03:59:40.933
BASICALLY BE SOMEBODY LAST FOR

03:59:40.999 --> 03:59:42.901
ONE YEAR AND THEN I I I

03:59:42.968 --> 03:59:47.005
APPRECIATE THAT DO CAUTION TO

03:59:47.072 --> 03:59:47.473
AND YET WE KNOW THAT.

03:59:47.539 --> 03:59:47.940
.

03:59:48.006 --> 03:59:49.775
SO WHEN THAT IF THE CHILD'S

03:59:49.842 --> 03:59:51.043
THREE YEARS OLD THREE WE GIVE

03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:52.177
MUST FIGHT FOR YOUR THEN THEY

03:59:52.244 --> 03:59:53.545
GET TO BE FOUR YEARS OLD MAYBE

03:59:53.612 --> 03:59:54.613
THEN THEY GO TO TRANSITIONAL

03:59:54.680 --> 03:59:55.647
KINDERGARTEN THAT THEY DON'T

03:59:55.714 --> 03:59:57.382
NEED THAT SLOT SO I'M. A LITTLE

03:59:57.449 --> 03:59:59.418
BIT LESS CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:59:59.485 --> 04:00:01.186
IT.

04:00:01.253 --> 04:00:02.988
WEATHER YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE

04:00:03.055 --> 04:00:03.822
TO MODIFY THE FUNDING LATER

04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:06.525
RIGHT.

04:00:06.592 --> 04:00:11.730
THAT'S MY THING.

04:00:11.797 --> 04:00:14.833
THANK YOU CENTER.

04:00:14.900 --> 04:00:17.302
BLOOM.

04:00:17.369 --> 04:00:18.036
THANK YOU.

04:00:18.103 --> 04:00:19.938
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK

04:00:20.005 --> 04:00:21.573
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:00:21.640 --> 04:00:23.408
PRIORITIZE INCREASING THE NUMBER

04:00:23.475 --> 04:00:26.245
OF SLOTS AND AND AND THAT. I IS

04:00:26.311 --> 04:00:27.713
WHAT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE

04:00:27.780 --> 04:00:28.614
PLAN DO.

04:00:28.680 --> 04:00:31.483
.

04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:33.385
BUT I I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING

04:00:33.452 --> 04:00:34.453
ABOUT THE A BLOCK GRANT TO A

04:00:34.520 --> 04:00:36.822
DOLLARS.

04:00:36.889 --> 04:00:38.290
WHERE WE HAVE DISCRETION WE

04:00:38.357 --> 04:00:40.793
OUGHT TO BE USING THAT TO ALSO

04:00:40.859 --> 04:00:42.461
PRIORITIZE MORE SLOT I DID SLOTS

04:00:42.528 --> 04:00:45.364
AND? I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION UP

04:00:45.430 --> 04:00:48.167
PERHAPS OF LA NO REGARDING. THE

04:00:48.233 --> 04:00:51.403
PROPOSAL TO REMOVE TITLED TWENTY

04:00:51.470 --> 04:00:53.038
TWO.

04:00:53.138 --> 04:00:54.840
FROM.

04:00:54.907 --> 04:00:57.276
I THINK IT'S OVER AT A NUMBER OF

04:00:57.342 --> 04:00:59.478
YEARS BUT AND IN PARTICULAR

04:00:59.545 --> 04:01:01.380
WHETHER IT IS SET A.

04:01:01.446 --> 04:01:02.981
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

04:01:03.048 --> 04:01:05.484
CONSIDERING.

04:01:05.551 --> 04:01:06.285
FOR.

04:01:06.385 --> 04:01:08.487
A FOR THIS YOUNGER POPULATION

04:01:08.554 --> 04:01:09.855
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

04:01:09.922 --> 04:01:10.522
IS NO TO.

04:01:10.589 --> 04:01:12.157
TITLED TWENTY TWO OVERSIGHT

04:01:12.224 --> 04:01:13.559
THERE'S UP THAT THERE ARE A

AT THESE FACILITIES AND THAT

04:01:20.332 --> 04:01:20.899

THAT'S.

04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:07.566
QUALITIES MOST A PURPORTED ISSUE.

04:04:07.632 --> 04:04:09.501
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THE FACT WE

04:04:09.568 --> 04:04:11.403

THANK YOU.

04:04:28.954 --> 04:04:30.922
OKAY SINGLE OTHER QUESTIONS WE

WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX.

04:04:36.828 --> 04:04:40.399
ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

04:04:40.465 --> 04:04:43.001

04:04:47.939 --> 04:04:49.107
COLLEGE SO THAT THE ME REVISED

04:04:49.174 --> 04:04:50.442
PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

04:04:50.509 --> 04:04:51.943
WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:53.979
ONE TIME. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

04:04:54.046 --> 04:04:55.580
ONGOING FOR THE CREATION OF A

04:04:55.647 --> 04:04:56.848
NEW ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:04:56.915 --> 04:04:59.418
THAT WOULD BE ARE RUN BY THE US

04:04:59.484 --> 04:05:00.919
BORDER GOVERNORS OF THE

04:05:00.986 --> 04:05:02.421
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:05:02.487 --> 04:05:04.956
I'M. THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WAS TO

04:05:05.023 --> 04:05:05.657
REJECT.

04:05:05.724 --> 04:05:07.092
THE CREATION OF THE NEW ONLINE

04:05:07.159 --> 04:05:08.026
COLLEGE.

04:05:08.093 --> 04:05:09.828
I'M THE SENATE ACTION WITH TO

04:05:09.895 --> 04:05:10.495
MODIFY.

04:05:10.562 --> 04:05:12.831
TIM TO MODIFY TO ADOPT ONLINE

04:05:12.898 --> 04:05:13.865
COLLEGE BUT ADDED SOME

04:05:13.932 --> 04:05:15.500
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS.

04:05:15.567 --> 04:05:16.168
TWO OF THE MORE NOTABLE

04:05:16.234 --> 04:05:17.702
RESTRICTIONS DOT POINT OUT ONE

04:05:17.769 --> 04:05:18.570
IS THAT THERE'S A TEN YEAR

04:05:18.637 --> 04:05:19.871
SUNSETON.

04:05:19.938 --> 04:05:21.640
ON THE COLLEGE AND THAT IT

04:05:21.706 --> 04:05:22.641
WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE NEW

04:05:22.707 --> 04:05:24.009
COLLEGE WOULD DEVELOP.

04:05:24.076 --> 04:05:25.377
SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT LEAD

04:05:25.444 --> 04:05:26.478
INTO PATHWAYS THAT EXISTING

04:05:26.545 --> 04:05:28.480
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:05:28.547 --> 04:05:29.881
I'M SO WE'VE RAISED SOME

04:05:29.948 --> 04:05:30.849
CONCERNS.

04:05:30.916 --> 04:05:32.417
IN THE PAST BUT THAT THE

04:05:32.484 --> 04:05:34.219
PROPOSAL FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE

04:05:34.286 --> 04:05:34.853
IN PARTICULAR I THINK FIRST WE

04:05:34.920 --> 04:05:36.721
CAN SEE CLEAR INDICATION FROM

04:05:36.788 --> 04:05:38.190
ADMINISTRATION OF WHAT EXISTING

04:05:38.256 --> 04:05:39.558
BARRIERS EXIST AT THE COMMUNITY

04:05:39.624 --> 04:05:41.159
COLLEGES THAT THIS ONLINE

04:05:41.226 --> 04:05:42.394
COLLEGES ADDRESSING.

04:05:42.461 --> 04:05:44.629
AND WE ALSO HAD CONCERNS WITH

04:05:44.696 --> 04:05:46.765
THE ABILITY OF AN ONLINE COLLEGE

04:05:46.832 --> 04:05:47.332
TO.

04:05:47.399 --> 04:05:50.168
HOW STATEWIDE ACCESS TO THE

04:05:50.235 --> 04:05:51.369
SORT OF HANDS ON EXPERIENCES

04:05:51.436 --> 04:05:52.471
THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR MOST OF

04:05:52.537 --> 04:05:53.872
THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO

04:05:53.939 --> 04:05:54.773
ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE

04:05:54.840 --> 04:05:56.541
ENROLLED IN THOSE PROGRAMS GET

04:05:56.608 --> 04:05:57.709
GET ACCESS TO THOSE?

04:05:57.776 --> 04:05:59.678
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES SOBRE SO WE

04:05:59.744 --> 04:06:01.012
CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND REJECTING

04:06:01.079 --> 04:06:01.980
THAT PIECE.

04:06:02.047 --> 04:06:04.149
THAT THERE'S ALSO AN AND

04:06:04.216 --> 04:06:05.750
ACTIONS THAT BOTH HOUSES TOOK

04:06:05.817 --> 04:06:06.384
THAT ARE.

04:06:06.451 --> 04:06:08.386
PROVIDING ONE TIME GRANTS TO

04:06:08.453 --> 04:06:10.422
EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR

04:06:10.489 --> 04:06:10.956
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE

04:06:11.022 --> 04:06:11.957
PROGRAMS.

04:06:12.023 --> 04:06:13.091
AND SO ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE

04:06:13.158 --> 04:06:14.693
THERE'S SIXTY MILLION I'M TO

04:06:14.759 --> 04:06:16.628
CREATE A NEW INSTITUTE. THAT

04:06:16.695 --> 04:06:18.063
WOULD DEVELOP ONLINE PROGRAMS.

04:06:18.130 --> 04:06:20.198
AND AND THE THE TARGET GROUP

04:06:20.265 --> 04:06:21.633
WOULD BE THE SAME TARGETED GROUP

04:06:21.700 --> 04:06:22.634
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EVER

04:06:22.701 --> 04:06:24.035
POSE FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE

04:06:24.102 --> 04:06:24.870
WHICH SHOULD BE.

04:06:24.936 --> 04:06:27.639
WORKING ADULTS WITH NO POST

04:06:27.706 --> 04:06:29.341
SECONDARY EDUCATION CREDENTIALS

04:06:29.407 --> 04:06:30.876
ARE MORE MOST LIKELY WORKING IN

04:06:30.942 --> 04:06:32.244
LOW WAGE JOBS OF IDEAS THAT YOU

04:06:32.310 --> 04:06:33.678
WOULD DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOR THAT

04:06:33.745 --> 04:06:34.846
PARTICULAR GROUP.

04:06:34.913 --> 04:06:36.148
AND THE IDEA FOR THIS.

04:06:36.214 --> 04:06:38.283
FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT

04:06:38.350 --> 04:06:39.784
THE THE PROGRAMS WOULD BE

04:06:39.851 --> 04:06:41.386
COMPETENCY BASED THAT THERE IS

04:06:41.453 --> 04:06:43.588
SOME. AND TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE

04:06:43.655 --> 04:06:44.456
USED OVERCOME AT THE BASIC

04:06:44.523 --> 04:06:45.790
FIGURE THAT PEOPLE CAN MOVE

04:06:45.857 --> 04:06:47.392
THROUGH THE PROGRAM'S QUICKER AS

04:06:47.459 --> 04:06:48.827
THEIR MASTERING CONTENT OR THEY

04:06:48.894 --> 04:06:50.896
CAN GO AT A SLOWER PACE OF ANY A

04:06:50.962 --> 04:06:52.497
LOT MORE TIME.

04:06:52.564 --> 04:06:54.866
AND THAT AND THE THE PROGRAM IT

04:06:54.933 --> 04:06:56.568
WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO NOT

04:06:56.635 --> 04:06:57.202
DUPLICATE OTHER.

04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:59.604
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THAT.

04:06:59.671 --> 04:07:01.373
ARE ALREADY BEING OFFERED.

04:07:01.439 --> 04:07:03.008
I'M ON THE SENATE SIDE THERE'S

04:07:03.074 --> 04:07:04.409
FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND

04:07:04.476 --> 04:07:06.011
THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED AS GRANTS

04:07:06.077 --> 04:07:06.444
TO.

04:07:06.511 --> 04:07:08.180
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS

04:07:08.246 --> 04:07:09.714
TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN ONLINE

04:07:09.781 --> 04:07:11.917
CONTENT AND FOR THAT CONTENT TO

04:07:11.983 --> 04:07:13.585
BE TIED TO EXISTING PATHWAYS.

04:07:13.652 --> 04:07:15.554
IN IT IN PROGRAMS OFFERED A

04:07:15.620 --> 04:07:17.355
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:07:17.422 --> 04:07:18.490
I'M IN ADDITION THE SENATE OFF.

04:07:18.557 --> 04:07:20.659
REQUIRES THE CHANCES OFFICE TO

04:07:20.725 --> 04:07:21.793
READ A REPORT THAT WOULD MAKE

04:07:21.860 --> 04:07:23.695
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW YOU COULD

04:07:23.762 --> 04:07:25.063
CHANGE NON CREDIT FUNDING RATES

04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.230
TO.

04:07:25.297 --> 04:07:27.299
TO IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OR

04:07:27.365 --> 04:07:28.266
ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

04:07:28.333 --> 04:07:30.235
COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS NOT

04:07:30.302 --> 04:07:31.670
JUST IN THE ONLINE PROGRAM BUT

04:07:31.736 --> 04:07:33.238
MORE BROADLY AND THAT THE

04:07:33.305 --> 04:07:35.340
FINDINGS ARE RATE AND THE METHOD

04:07:35.407 --> 04:07:36.541
OF FUNDING IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY

04:07:36.608 --> 04:07:37.475
VERY. CONCERNED ONE OF THE

04:07:37.542 --> 04:07:39.377
PRIMARY BARRIERS FOR MORE

04:07:39.444 --> 04:07:41.279
COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS.

04:07:41.346 --> 04:07:43.248
SO ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF THESE

04:07:43.315 --> 04:07:44.516
ONE TIME GRANTS WE DO THINK THE

04:07:44.583 --> 04:07:45.817
PROVIDING SOME FUNDING COULD BE

04:07:45.884 --> 04:07:47.185
HELPFUL TO HELP OUR IMPROVE THE

04:07:47.252 --> 04:07:48.753
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ARE PROGRAM

04:07:48.820 --> 04:07:50.822
STATEWIDE. WE DO THINK AT COUPLE

04:07:50.889 --> 04:07:52.390
THINGS WE WOULD RECOMMEND IN IN

04:07:52.457 --> 04:07:53.959
DEVELOPING THEM IS THAT.

04:07:54.025 --> 04:07:55.927
YOU PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS THAT.

04:07:55.994 --> 04:07:57.929
IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO

04:07:57.996 --> 04:07:59.464
ONLINE CONTENT CURRENTLY AND

04:07:59.531 --> 04:08:00.498
ALSO IN AREAS THAT HAVE

04:08:00.565 --> 04:08:02.901
RECOGNIZED INDUSTRY DEMANDS THAT

04:08:02.968 --> 04:08:03.535
YOU ARE CUTTING PROGRAMS THAT.

04:08:03.602 --> 04:08:05.937
BETTER PROVIDING AND ACCESS TO

04:08:06.004 --> 04:08:06.705
A NEW PROGRAM THAT'S NOT

04:08:06.771 --> 04:08:09.040
AVAILABLE AND THAT'S GONNA LEAD

04:08:09.107 --> 04:08:09.641
TO SOMEONE GOING OUT TO GET A

04:08:09.708 --> 04:08:10.475
GOOD JOB.

04:08:10.542 --> 04:08:11.643
I'M WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND

REQUIRING ALIGNMENT.

04:08:12.344 --> 04:08:14.079
AS THE THE SENATE DOES IN THEIR.

04:08:14.145 --> 04:08:15.513
PEACE WITH WITH EXISTING

04:08:15.580 --> 04:08:16.681
BECAUSE PATHWAYS TO SOMEONE CAN

04:08:16.748 --> 04:08:18.183
TAKE A SHORT TERM PROGRAM AND

04:08:18.250 --> 04:08:20.018
THEN BE ABLE TO AYE IF THEY WANT

04:08:20.085 --> 04:08:21.253

04:08:21.319 --> 04:08:22.854
CAN DO THAT SEAMLESSLY WITHOUT

04:08:22.921 --> 04:08:24.656
HAVING TO START FROM SCRATCH.

04:08:24.723 --> 04:08:26.758
ARM AND AND THEN FINALLY I'M WE

04:08:26.825 --> 04:08:27.559
WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE

04:08:27.626 --> 04:08:28.493

04:08:31.863 --> 04:08:32.597
REPORTING REQUIREMENT WHICH

04:08:32.664 --> 04:08:33.565

PROGRAMS TO ALSO BE COMPETENCY

04:08:41.740 --> 04:08:43.174

04:14:00.291 --> 04:14:01.826
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER COST

04:14:01.893 --> 04:14:03.928
FACTORS THAT AND OTHER LOCAL

04:14:03.995 --> 04:14:05.530
COMMUNICATES DISTRICTS ARE FACED

04:14:05.597 --> 04:14:07.065
WITH. SECONDARILY THE

04:14:07.131 --> 04:14:08.232
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY

04:14:08.299 --> 04:14:09.934
CONCERN WITH THE SENATE PROPOSAL

04:14:10.001 --> 04:14:11.336
THAT WE WOULD KEEP THE FEES THIS

IS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND AS

04:14:13.204 --> 04:14:14.439
SUCH IT WOULD FALL IN LINE WITH

04:14:14.505 --> 04:14:16.074
CAN YOU COLLEGES SEE ISSUE IN

04:14:16.140 --> 04:14:18.209
YOU SEE TO KEEP FEES AFFORDABLE

KEEPING OUR FEES THAT THAT SORT

04:14:23.948 --> 04:14:26.851
OF A LEVEL.

I SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU AS

04:14:30.555 --> 04:14:31.055
CHAIR.

04:14:31.122 --> 04:14:33.257
FIRST I WANT TO SAY ONE TO

04:14:33.324 --> 04:14:34.892
COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION.

04:14:34.959 --> 04:14:36.260
FOR THIS ONLINE EFFORT I'VE

04:14:36.327 --> 04:14:37.595
THINK I'VE BEEN SAYING I THINK

04:14:37.662 --> 04:14:39.364
CONSISTENTLY SINCE I'VE BEEN UP

04:14:39.430 --> 04:14:41.332
HERE. BOTH TO OUR FRIENDS IN K.

04:14:41.399 --> 04:14:42.934
THROUGH TWELVE AND.

04:14:43.001 --> 04:14:44.302
OUR FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY

04:14:44.369 --> 04:14:46.537
COLLEGE SYSTEM IN AND OF SEE

04:14:46.604 --> 04:14:48.206
ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE THAT. GIVEN

04:14:48.272 --> 04:14:49.974
THE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE

04:14:50.041 --> 04:14:50.408
STATE.

04:14:50.475 --> 04:14:53.344
HAS MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE TIME

04:14:53.411 --> 04:14:54.679
TO TALK TO SOME EXTENT TO

04:14:54.746 --> 04:14:56.314
ANOTHER.

04:14:56.381 --> 04:14:57.682
AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO

04:14:57.749 --> 04:14:59.851
BUSINESS IN EDUCATION TODAY JUST

04:14:59.917 --> 04:15:01.252
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR

04:15:01.319 --> 04:15:03.287
THE PAST SIXTY YEARS THAT WAY.

04:15:03.354 --> 04:15:04.656
AND SO THIS ONLINE EFFORT IN

04:15:04.722 --> 04:15:06.024
THIS EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO

04:15:06.090 --> 04:15:07.592
FIGURE OUT THE PATH.

04:15:07.659 --> 04:15:09.527
FOR ONLINE EDUCATION I THINK IS

04:15:09.594 --> 04:15:10.928
A VALUABLE ONE IN ONE WORST

04:15:10.995 --> 04:15:12.897
COMMENDING.

04:15:12.964 --> 04:15:14.632
HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW I'M

04:15:14.699 --> 04:15:16.134
ALWAYS CONCERNED IN THE MILITARY

04:15:16.200 --> 04:15:17.168
WE CALL IT THE TWO'S TO TAIL

04:15:17.235 --> 04:15:18.569
RATIO.

04:15:18.636 --> 04:15:20.071
YOU CERTAINLY WANT MORE TEETH

04:15:20.138 --> 04:15:21.773
THAN YOU HAVE TALE BECAUSE THEY

04:15:21.839 --> 04:15:23.174
OF COURSE THE TEETH OR WHAT.

04:15:23.241 --> 04:15:25.410
GIVE YOUR.

04:15:25.476 --> 04:15:26.411
GIVE YOU THE IMPETUS RIGHT MAKE

04:15:26.477 --> 04:15:28.312
THINGS HAPPEN.

04:15:28.379 --> 04:15:30.048
AND SO ARE WHEN CONSIDERING A

04:15:30.114 --> 04:15:31.182
TUESDAY TO TAIL RATIO.

04:15:31.249 --> 04:15:34.285
.

04:15:34.352 --> 04:15:36.788
ONE OF THE ISSUES IT SEEMS TO ME

04:15:36.854 --> 04:15:38.756
IN SETTING UP A NEW ONLINE

04:15:38.823 --> 04:15:41.659
COLLEGE IS A SEPARATE ENTITY.

04:15:41.726 --> 04:15:43.161
IS ALL THAT COMES WITH SETTING

04:15:43.227 --> 04:15:45.029
UP A NEW COLLEGE.

04:15:45.096 --> 04:15:46.464
IT'S TAKING A BOARD OF GOVERNORS

04:15:46.531 --> 04:15:48.499
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A.

04:15:48.566 --> 04:15:49.867
ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH THE

04:15:49.934 --> 04:15:51.335
DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF A

04:15:51.402 --> 04:15:54.172
COLLEGE IT'S HIRING A NEW.

04:15:54.238 --> 04:15:56.507
COLLEGE PRESIDENT IT'S HIRING

04:15:56.574 --> 04:15:58.509
THE VICE PRESIDENT'S IT NORMALLY

04:15:58.576 --> 04:16:00.111
HAVE TO FOLLOW A PRESIDENT IT'S

04:16:00.178 --> 04:16:02.046
HIRING CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS AND

04:16:02.113 --> 04:16:03.748
ALL THE REST OF THE THINGS THAT

04:16:03.815 --> 04:16:05.416
I ASSUME WE WILL BE DEALING WITH.

04:16:05.483 --> 04:16:07.418
WITH A NEW ONLINE.

04:16:07.485 --> 04:16:09.687
A COLLEGE AND I GUESS THEY'RE

04:16:09.754 --> 04:16:11.522
HAVING SAID ALL THAT. AND GIVEN

04:16:11.589 --> 04:16:13.291
THE FACT THAT MONEY IS NOT

04:16:13.357 --> 04:16:14.859
UNLIMITED EVEN THIS YEAR.

04:16:14.926 --> 04:16:17.061
WHY WOULD E NOT FOCUS FOR

04:16:17.128 --> 04:16:19.731
EXAMPLE ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE?

04:16:19.797 --> 04:16:21.032
ASSEMBLY IS COME UP WITH WERE

04:16:21.099 --> 04:16:23.768
YOU TAKEN EXISTING COLLEGE OR.

04:16:23.835 --> 04:16:26.137
THE CHANCELLOR DESIGNATES OF.

04:16:26.204 --> 04:16:28.773
THE CONSORTIUM OF COLLEGES TO.

04:16:28.840 --> 04:16:30.908
WITHIN THEIR EXISTING FRAMEWORK

04:16:30.975 --> 04:16:33.244
SET UP AN INSTITUTE THAT IS AN

04:16:33.311 --> 04:16:35.113
ONLINE INSTITUTE.

04:16:35.179 --> 04:16:36.614
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE A

04:16:36.681 --> 04:16:38.483
NEW PRESIDENT TO WHERE WE DON'T

04:16:38.549 --> 04:16:39.984
HAVE TO HIRE TEN VICE PRESIDENTS

04:16:40.051 --> 04:16:41.753
WERE WE HAVE?

04:16:41.819 --> 04:16:44.789
A BOARD OF TRUSTEES OR US. MAYBE

04:16:44.856 --> 04:16:46.858
A COMBINED BOARD THAT'S CUSTOM

04:16:46.924 --> 04:16:48.726
TO DEALING WITH THE DAY TO DAY

04:16:48.793 --> 04:16:49.794
FUNCTIONING OF AN ACADEMIC

04:16:49.861 --> 04:16:50.962
INSTITUTION.

04:16:51.028 --> 04:16:52.730
AND ALLOW THESE

04:16:52.797 --> 04:16:54.198
HOPEFULLY INNOVATIVE ONLINE

04:16:54.265 --> 04:16:55.700
PROGRAMMES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

04:16:55.767 --> 04:16:57.101
TALKING ABOUT.

04:16:57.168 --> 04:16:59.370
ONLINE PROGRAMS TO SPEED

04:16:59.437 --> 04:17:01.539
FRESHMAN ENGLISH YOUR BASIC MATH

04:17:01.606 --> 04:17:02.807
OR WHATEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:17:02.874 --> 04:17:04.909
PUTTING ONLINE PROGRAMS INTO.

04:17:04.976 --> 04:17:06.344
PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT AS I

04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:08.713
UNDERSTAND IT.

04:17:08.780 --> 04:17:10.715
TO TAKE FOLKS WHO ARE. OR OLDER

04:17:10.782 --> 04:17:11.949
BUT CERTAINLY MUCH YOUNGER THAN

04:17:12.016 --> 04:17:13.651
I AM AND TAKE THEM INTO THE

04:17:13.718 --> 04:17:14.952
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WITH

04:17:15.019 --> 04:17:16.621
RESPECT TO THEIR SKILLS SO WE

04:17:16.687 --> 04:17:18.189
WOULD TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE

04:17:18.256 --> 04:17:19.724
HAVE AVAILABLE NOT SPEND IT ON

04:17:19.791 --> 04:17:21.092
STRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE

04:17:21.159 --> 04:17:23.261
BUREAUCRACY. AND PUSH IT DOWN

04:17:23.327 --> 04:17:24.328
TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE

04:17:24.395 --> 04:17:25.963
COURSES.

04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:27.431
THE SETTING OF GOALS OBJECTIVES

04:17:27.498 --> 04:17:29.000
METRICS AND MEASUREMENT TO MAKE

04:17:29.066 --> 04:17:31.469
SURE AT LEAST INITIALLY.

04:17:31.536 --> 04:17:33.171
THAT THE ONLINE PROGRAM IS

04:17:33.237 --> 04:17:35.173
SUCCESSFUL AND THEN CONSIDER

04:17:35.239 --> 04:17:36.941
WHETHER WE WANT TO PUT.

04:17:37.008 --> 04:17:38.142
ANOTHER COLLEGE ON THE

04:17:38.209 --> 04:17:39.811
CHALKBOARD OF THE CHANCELLOR OF

04:17:39.877 --> 04:17:40.444
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:17:40.511 --> 04:17:42.446
SYSTEM.

04:17:42.513 --> 04:17:44.315
THAT'S A LONG QUESTION MY

04:17:44.382 --> 04:17:45.983
QUESTION TO BOIL IT DOWN AS WHY

04:17:46.050 --> 04:17:48.553
NOT FOCUS ON THE ASSEMBLIES

04:17:48.619 --> 04:17:50.321
COLLEGE YOUR CONSORTIUM. AN

04:17:50.388 --> 04:17:51.923
INSTITUTE PROPOSAL.

04:17:51.989 --> 04:17:52.690
SENATOR I THINK I WOULD

04:17:52.757 --> 04:17:54.292
REFERENCE YOUR FIRST COMMENT ON

04:17:54.358 --> 04:17:55.593
THIS MATTER WHICH IS THE

04:17:55.660 --> 04:17:57.361
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO

04:17:57.428 --> 04:17:59.363
LOOK AT DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

04:17:59.430 --> 04:18:01.465
AND WE FEEL COMMUNICATIVE HAVE

04:18:01.532 --> 04:18:02.633
MANY DIFFERENT MISSIONS

04:18:02.700 --> 04:18:05.369
IMPORTANT MISSIONS ON INCLUDING.

04:18:05.436 --> 04:18:08.105
CERTIFICATES DEGREES THIS IS A

04:18:08.172 --> 04:18:09.941
VERY TARGETED APPROACH REALLY

04:18:10.007 --> 04:18:11.275
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

04:18:11.342 --> 04:18:13.077
RESEARCH ABOUT ONLINE OBVIOUSLY

04:18:13.144 --> 04:18:14.579
WE'VE TALKED IS ADMINISTRATION

04:18:14.645 --> 04:18:16.280
FREQUENTLY ABOUT ONLINE AND

04:18:16.347 --> 04:18:18.482
WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN. UTILIZE

04:18:18.549 --> 04:18:19.584
IT MORE EFFECTIVELY WITHIN

04:18:19.650 --> 04:18:21.252
HIGHER EDUCATION.

04:18:21.319 --> 04:18:23.054
ADULTS GENERALLY DO YOU BETTER

04:18:23.120 --> 04:18:25.089
THAN HANGING AYE TRADITIONAL

04:18:25.156 --> 04:18:26.457
COLLEGE STUDENT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR

04:18:26.524 --> 04:18:29.060
OLD AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT ON

04:18:29.126 --> 04:18:31.128
THE WE FELT THAT CREATING A NEW

04:18:31.195 --> 04:18:33.130
ENTITY. ON THAT DOESN'T HAVE

04:18:33.197 --> 04:18:34.432
SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS

04:18:34.498 --> 04:18:36.300
AN ACADEMIC CALENDAR WHERE THEY

04:18:36.367 --> 04:18:37.501
CAN OFFER CURRICULUM ON A

04:18:37.568 --> 04:18:39.003
ROLLING BASIS FOR PEOPLE CAN

04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:40.638
FIND OUT ON GOING TO TAKE THESE

04:18:40.705 --> 04:18:42.807
COURSES. IS THE MORE PREFERRED

04:18:42.874 --> 04:18:44.475
APPROACH

04:18:44.542 --> 04:18:45.142
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

04:18:45.209 --> 04:18:47.345
THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT FIRST YEAR

04:18:47.411 --> 04:18:49.480
COST IS MORE SIGNIFICANT TO YOUR

04:18:49.547 --> 04:18:50.882
POINT OF BUILDING OUT THE

04:18:50.948 --> 04:18:52.149
INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:18:52.216 --> 04:18:53.918
BUT WE FEEL TEN TWENTY MILLION

04:18:53.985 --> 04:18:55.419
DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE EFFORT

04:18:55.486 --> 04:18:57.421
WHICH. I THINK IS A REALLY.

04:18:57.488 --> 04:18:59.423
REASONABLE COST.

04:18:59.490 --> 04:19:01.359
GIVEN THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

04:19:01.425 --> 04:19:02.927
WE EXPECT TO SEE FOR WORKING

04:19:02.994 --> 04:19:05.162
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WHO WILL

04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:06.297
EARN A MORE.

04:19:06.364 --> 04:19:08.900
AND BETTER LIVING WAGE GIVEN

04:19:08.966 --> 04:19:10.201
HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND SOME OF

04:19:10.268 --> 04:19:12.003
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WORKING

04:19:12.069 --> 04:19:13.137
CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING.

04:19:13.204 --> 04:19:14.472
WELL I CERTAINLY THINK THE

04:19:14.538 --> 04:19:15.706
EFFORTS NOTABLE ON I THINK

04:19:15.773 --> 04:19:17.041
WHETHER WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN

04:19:17.108 --> 04:19:18.309
APPROACH AS TO WHETHER WE DO IT

04:19:18.376 --> 04:19:19.677
WITH AN INSTITUTE WOULD DO WITH

04:19:19.744 --> 04:19:21.679
A SEPARATE. ONLINE COLLEGE I

04:19:21.746 --> 04:19:22.713
THINK WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

04:19:22.780 --> 04:19:24.348
WITH IT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS

04:19:24.415 --> 04:19:25.917
THAT THAT IMPORTANT.

04:19:25.983 --> 04:19:27.418
TO THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE

04:19:27.485 --> 04:19:28.853
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN

04:19:28.920 --> 04:19:30.121
I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS IN THANK

04:19:30.187 --> 04:19:32.857
YOU UP MISTER.

04:19:32.924 --> 04:19:41.098
THANK YOU MISTER ABRUPT.

04:19:41.165 --> 04:19:44.635
IT'S GOING TO SAVE.

04:19:44.702 --> 04:19:46.537
HE SAID BLOOM HE LOOKED AT ME.

04:19:46.604 --> 04:19:48.539
YOU CAN MAKE THAT.

04:19:48.606 --> 04:19:53.177
THAT'S RIGHT WILL.

04:19:53.244 --> 04:19:54.512
I DO THE QUESTIONS DEPARTMENT OF

04:19:54.578 --> 04:19:55.746
FINANCE SO I WIN THE

04:19:55.813 --> 04:19:56.714
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR

04:19:56.781 --> 04:19:58.582
YOUR THIS CAME OUT IN JANUARY I

04:19:58.649 --> 04:20:00.351
WAS EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC

04:20:00.418 --> 04:20:01.919
BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT. THIS

04:20:01.986 --> 04:20:03.688
COULD REALLY BE THE CATALYST FOR

04:20:03.754 --> 04:20:06.123
AS YOU SAY POVERTY REDUCTION AND

04:20:06.190 --> 04:20:06.724
REACHING A WHOLE NEW

04:20:06.791 --> 04:20:08.659
STRATOFORTRESSES AT A REDUCED

04:20:08.726 --> 04:20:11.095
COST SO. I WAS A AND TUESDAY

04:20:11.162 --> 04:20:12.897
AFTER SUPPORTER AND WAS REALLY

04:20:12.964 --> 04:20:14.665
DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE MAY REVISE

04:20:14.732 --> 04:20:15.366
CAME OUT.

04:20:15.433 --> 04:20:17.034
AND PUT SOME SUBSTANTIAL

04:20:17.101 --> 04:20:18.736
RESTRICTIONS ON THAT MEAN FOR

04:20:18.803 --> 04:20:20.938
EXAMPLE THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE

04:20:21.005 --> 04:20:22.640
TYPE OF ONLINE OFFERINGS THAT

04:20:22.707 --> 04:20:23.708
COULD BE OFFERED. OTHER

04:20:23.774 --> 04:20:25.009
REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTIVE

04:20:25.076 --> 04:20:26.544
BARGAINING FOR FACULTY THE

04:20:26.610 --> 04:20:28.346
RESTRICTIONS TO ONLINE EDUCATION

04:20:28.412 --> 04:20:30.047
ONLY SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT

04:20:30.114 --> 04:20:31.849
CAPITALIZE KIND OF MY THINKING

04:20:31.916 --> 04:20:32.483
THAT MAYBE THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT

04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:33.684
WAY

04:20:33.751 --> 04:20:34.285
I GO. AND I WONDERED IF YOU

04:20:34.352 --> 04:20:36.754
COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT SOME OF

04:20:36.821 --> 04:20:38.756
THE DECISION FACTORS WERE IN THE

04:20:38.823 --> 04:20:39.857
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPOSAL

04:20:39.924 --> 04:20:45.363
IN JANUARY AND MAY.

04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:46.197

ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS OUR MANY

04:20:53.204 --> 04:20:54.171
CONCERNS THAT.

04:20:54.238 --> 04:20:55.473
WE BIT WE HEARD ABOUT THE ONLY

04:20:55.539 --> 04:20:57.575

TO ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE FOR

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SO WE I

04:21:01.479 --> 04:21:03.848
TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW

04:21:03.914 --> 04:21:04.915
AT THE COLLEGE TO PARTNER WITH

04:21:04.982 --> 04:21:06.317

04:21:06.384 --> 04:21:07.018
PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE

THERE'S A STRUCTURE IN. PLACE.

04:21:10.087 --> 04:21:11.756
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ONCE THE

04:21:11.822 --> 04:21:14.158
COLLEGE IS ESTABLISHED I WOULD

04:21:14.225 --> 04:21:15.893
NOTE THAT THE OTHER AMENDMENTS

DISABILITY.

04:21:33.310 --> 04:21:34.979
PROVISIONS WE ADOPTED

STUDENTS AND ENSURING THAT THESE

04:21:44.355 --> 04:21:45.790
PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORKING FOR

04:21:45.856 --> 04:21:46.690
THAT INTENDED.

04:21:46.757 --> 04:21:49.193
A POPULATION THERE WERE SOME

04:21:49.260 --> 04:21:49.860
AREAS AT.

04:21:49.927 --> 04:21:51.462
AMENDMENTS IN SOME AREAS

REGARDING CURRICULUM AND THOSE

04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:54.565
WHO REALLY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

04:21:54.632 --> 04:21:56.500
THAT THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY

04:21:56.567 --> 04:21:57.668
THE COLLEGE AND ITS FACULTY

04:21:57.735 --> 04:21:59.804
WOULD HAVE TO SEE PROTECTIONS.

04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.970
AS.

04:22:00.037 --> 04:22:03.140
OTHER CURRICULUM I DEVELOP A

04:22:03.207 --> 04:22:05.709
FACULTY AT OTHER COLLEGES AND A

04:22:05.776 --> 04:22:05.943
REALLY.

04:22:06.010 --> 04:22:08.946
CLARIFY THE INTENT TO DEVELOP

04:22:09.013 --> 04:22:10.581
UNIQUE CONTENT TO THAT ISN'T

04:22:10.648 --> 04:22:11.415
DEPLETED OF.

04:22:11.482 --> 04:22:13.851
OF ON CONTENT IT UP OTHER

04:22:13.918 --> 04:22:15.553
COLLEGES SO THOSE WERE THE SEVEN

04:22:15.619 --> 04:22:16.754
SEVEN MEN MEN'S THAT REALLY

04:22:16.821 --> 04:22:18.055
TRIED TO STRENGTH AND.

04:22:18.122 --> 04:22:20.391
THE REPORTING AND THE TYPE OF

04:22:20.458 --> 04:22:24.328
INSTRUCTION AND THE TYPE OF ON

04:22:24.395 --> 04:22:24.862
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT THE

04:22:24.929 --> 04:22:26.063
COLLEGE.

04:22:26.130 --> 04:22:26.664
WELL IN RETROSPECT I I WASN'T

04:22:26.730 --> 04:22:27.998
SURPRISED WHEN THAT HAPPENED

04:22:28.065 --> 04:22:28.799
OF MY INTERPRETATION OF IT WAS A

04:22:28.866 --> 04:22:30.301
BIT DIFFERENT. I THINK THAT THE

04:22:30.367 --> 04:22:32.736
EXISTING SYSTEM GOT ITS CLAWS IN.

04:22:32.803 --> 04:22:33.804
RIGHT AND.

04:22:33.871 --> 04:22:35.506
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE

04:22:35.573 --> 04:22:37.041
ONLINE OFFERING LOOK MORE LIKE A

04:22:37.108 --> 04:22:38.776
TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:22:38.843 --> 04:22:39.743
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A DIRE

04:22:39.810 --> 04:22:42.346
MISTAKE BECAUSE. THE WHOLE. OF

04:22:42.413 --> 04:22:44.081
THE WHOLE REASON FOR TRANSITION

04:22:44.148 --> 04:22:45.683
AND ONLINE OFFERINGS.

04:22:45.749 --> 04:22:47.084
IS TO AVOID BEING LOCKED INTO AN

04:22:47.151 --> 04:22:48.519
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT'S BASED

04:22:48.586 --> 04:22:50.121
ON.

04:22:50.187 --> 04:22:53.023
A PARADIGM HUNDRED YEARS OLD.

04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:54.625
RIGHT WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY AND AND

04:22:54.692 --> 04:22:56.594
INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER AN

04:22:56.660 --> 04:22:58.262
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT'S

04:22:58.329 --> 04:22:59.196
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAT WE

04:22:59.263 --> 04:23:01.599
DID. NOT EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO

04:23:01.665 --> 04:23:03.300
AND I THINK THAT THAT A SHIFT TO

04:23:03.367 --> 04:23:05.603
THAT KIND OF. EDUCATIONAL MODEL

04:23:05.669 --> 04:23:06.837
ALSO REQUIRES SHIFT IN OUR

04:23:06.904 --> 04:23:08.105
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE

04:23:08.172 --> 04:23:09.673
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT KIND OF

04:23:09.740 --> 04:23:11.108
OFFERING LOOKS LIKE.

04:23:11.175 --> 04:23:12.443
AND I THINK IT'S A A DIRE

04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:14.245
MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT IT LOOKS

04:23:14.311 --> 04:23:16.647
JUST LIKE WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND SO.

04:23:16.714 --> 04:23:18.382
THAT'S WHY I WAS DISAPPOINTED

04:23:18.449 --> 04:23:19.350
THAT THE IT LOOKED LIKE THE

04:23:19.416 --> 04:23:20.918
EXISTING SYSTEM WAS TRYING TO

04:23:20.985 --> 04:23:21.785
MAKE IT LOOK JUST LIKE ANOTHER

04:23:21.852 --> 04:23:23.087
BRANCH OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:23:23.154 --> 04:23:24.355
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT KINDA

04:23:24.421 --> 04:23:25.523
CATALYZE THE SANDWICH THINKING

04:23:25.589 --> 04:23:26.557
ABOUT. GOING TO DIFFERENT

04:23:26.624 --> 04:23:27.591
DIRECTION AND AND THAT'S WHY I'M

04:23:27.658 --> 04:23:29.393
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

04:23:29.460 --> 04:23:30.661
AND IF I MAY ADD TO HAVE THE

04:23:30.728 --> 04:23:32.496
FLEXIBILITY IS IN THE PROPOSAL

04:23:32.563 --> 04:23:34.064
IS AT THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD BE

04:23:34.131 --> 04:23:35.966
TIED TO THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR

04:23:36.033 --> 04:23:38.836
AND. I WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TO

04:23:38.903 --> 04:23:39.770
EXPLORE DEVELOPING COMPETENCY

04:23:39.837 --> 04:23:41.438
BASED EDUCATIONS AND THOSE ARE

04:23:41.505 --> 04:23:43.174
TWO CORE COMPONENTS THAT ARE A

04:23:43.240 --> 04:23:44.375
PART OF THE PROPOSAL CHURCH AND

04:23:44.441 --> 04:23:45.676
THOSE ARE UNLIKE. TRADITIONAL

04:23:45.743 --> 04:23:47.411
OFFERINGS BUT EVERYTHING ELSE

04:23:47.478 --> 04:23:48.612
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES

04:23:48.679 --> 04:23:50.181
TO BE MADE. ARTWORK IT SEEMED

04:23:50.247 --> 04:23:51.282
LIKE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT LOOK

04:23:51.348 --> 04:23:53.384
MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL OFFERING

04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.951
AND I JUST I THINK THAT'S A

04:23:54.018 --> 04:23:56.353
MISTAKE.

04:23:56.420 --> 04:23:57.888
IF FOR GOODS THAT I THINK THIS

04:23:57.955 --> 04:23:59.790
IS A A MYSTERY AUTHOR MEMORABLE

04:23:59.857 --> 04:24:00.824
ROLE TO GOT TO ADD SOME COMMENTS

04:24:00.891 --> 04:24:01.892
ON JUST. THE ISSUE OF AS YOU

04:24:01.959 --> 04:24:03.427
DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO HAVE

04:24:03.494 --> 04:24:05.029
PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR IT FOR

04:24:05.095 --> 04:24:07.231
ONLINE. PROGRAMS DECIDING WHAT

04:24:07.298 --> 04:24:09.233
YOU WHAT THE INTENT OF THAT THAT

04:24:09.300 --> 04:24:10.601
FUNDING IS FOR. IF.

04:24:10.668 --> 04:24:13.137
IF YOU WANT THERE TO BE.

04:24:13.204 --> 04:24:15.072
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ENTIRE

04:24:15.139 --> 04:24:16.340
SYSTEM.

04:24:16.407 --> 04:24:17.741
THEN I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THE

04:24:17.808 --> 04:24:19.710
THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE

04:24:19.777 --> 04:24:20.377
PORTION OF THE.

04:24:20.444 --> 04:24:22.079
A ONE TIME PORTION OF THE

04:24:22.146 --> 04:24:23.047
SENATE VERSION WHERE YOU'RE

04:24:23.113 --> 04:24:24.682
PROVIDING FUNDING TO COLLEGES

04:24:24.748 --> 04:24:25.549
WILL HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE

04:24:25.616 --> 04:24:26.884
EXISTING RULES OF THE SYSTEM TO

04:24:26.951 --> 04:24:29.486
MAKE THE PROGRAMS WORK. THAT

04:24:29.553 --> 04:24:30.521
FIFTH

04:24:30.588 --> 04:24:32.556
IF IF YOU WANT THE SYSTEM AS A

04:24:32.623 --> 04:24:33.157
WHOLE TO IMPROVING YOUR NOT

04:24:33.224 --> 04:24:34.625
GONNA CHANGE THE RULES THEN THE

04:24:34.692 --> 04:24:35.459
FOLKS HERE GIVING THE MONEY TO

04:24:35.526 --> 04:24:36.660
TO EXPERIMENT COME UP IN THE

04:24:36.727 --> 04:24:38.028
PROGRAMS.

04:24:38.095 --> 04:24:39.530
HAVE TO USE THOSE SAME RULES IF

04:24:39.597 --> 04:24:40.431
YOU'RE DEFINING AN ONLINE

04:24:40.497 --> 04:24:41.365
COLLEGE AND YOU WANT TO BE

04:24:41.432 --> 04:24:42.866
DEFERRED YOU DO NEED TO HAVE A

04:24:42.933 --> 04:24:43.968
COMPLETE DIFFERENT MISSION

04:24:44.034 --> 04:24:45.035
ATTACK. THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD

04:24:45.102 --> 04:24:46.637
BE. DEFERRED AND YOU NEED TO GET

04:24:46.704 --> 04:24:48.038
TO DO INNOVATIVE THINGS BUT IF

04:24:48.105 --> 04:24:49.473
YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU'RE ALSO

04:24:49.540 --> 04:24:50.808
THOSE BATS ALSO MAKING IT MORE

04:24:50.874 --> 04:24:52.409
DIFFICULT FOR THE AND THE REST

04:24:52.476 --> 04:24:53.444
OF THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO

04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:55.045
ADOPT THESE CHANGES. BECAUSE

04:24:55.112 --> 04:24:56.647
THEY DON'T HAVE TO THEY'LL GET

04:24:56.714 --> 04:24:57.248
THE PLAY BY THE FEDERAL SITE

04:24:57.314 --> 04:24:58.349
JUST THAT. ARE AT IT IF YOU

04:24:58.415 --> 04:24:59.516
THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

04:24:59.583 --> 04:25:01.752
MISSION OF THE TH DUH INSTITUTE

04:25:01.819 --> 04:25:03.787
OR THE NEW COLLEGE AND I'M WHAT

04:25:03.854 --> 04:25:05.389
IS THE WHAT IS YOUR HOPE FOR.

04:25:05.456 --> 04:25:07.524
WENT WHEN THAT PROGRAM IS IS

04:25:07.591 --> 04:25:08.325
ROLLED OUT.

04:25:08.392 --> 04:25:10.160
HOW THAT CHANGES THE SYSTEM

04:25:10.227 --> 04:25:11.295
MOVING FORWARD IS THAT SOMETHING

04:25:11.362 --> 04:25:12.896
THAT A SPECIAL INNOVATIVE THING

04:25:12.963 --> 04:25:14.565
OR THE THING THAT'S INTENDED TO?

04:25:14.632 --> 04:25:16.200
HELP COLLEGES TO HAVE THEIR OWN

04:25:16.267 --> 04:25:17.468
SPECIFIC RULES HOW TO HAVE A

04:25:17.534 --> 04:25:19.236
BETTER OPERATE. AND I WOULD ALSO

04:25:19.303 --> 04:25:20.237
POINT OUT THAT FROM THIS YOU CAN

04:25:20.304 --> 04:25:21.639
MOVE ON TERMS OF THE FUNDING AT

04:25:21.705 --> 04:25:22.473
THE CLOUD CENTER MORE OCCUPANTS

04:25:22.539 --> 04:25:24.808
IN AS WELL. ACTUALLY IT IT IN

04:25:24.875 --> 04:25:26.577
THE THIS PROPOSAL WOULDN'T BE OF

04:25:26.644 --> 04:25:27.778
CONCERN WITH THE FINANCIAL

04:25:27.845 --> 04:25:29.346
VIABILITY OF THE ONCOLOGY PART

04:25:29.413 --> 04:25:30.981
BECAUSE THE. COLLEGES GETTING

04:25:31.048 --> 04:25:32.149
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING

04:25:32.216 --> 04:25:35.953
RIGHT NOW JUST IN PERPETUITY.

04:25:36.020 --> 04:25:36.954
AND THEN IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE

04:25:37.021 --> 04:25:37.421
GETTING.

04:25:37.488 --> 04:25:39.456
PER AFTER YOU FUNDING AS IT HAS

04:25:39.523 --> 04:25:40.758
ENROLLMENT SO IT ACTUALLY GETS

04:25:40.824 --> 04:25:41.859
AND WOULD GET MORE AMOUNT

04:25:41.925 --> 04:25:42.293
PRESSED YOU BASIS.

04:25:42.359 --> 04:25:44.361
THEN.

04:25:44.428 --> 04:25:46.130
CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO SO

04:25:46.196 --> 04:25:47.665
THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING FOR YOU

04:25:47.731 --> 04:25:48.532
THINK ABOUT AS YOU IF YOU ARE

04:25:48.599 --> 04:25:49.867
GOING TO DEVELOP IT ONLY BECAUSE

04:25:49.933 --> 04:25:50.701
YOU WANT THIS TO BE A CASE RIGHT

04:25:50.768 --> 04:25:52.403
NOW. I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND

04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:53.937
WHY IN INITIALLY AS THE PROGRAM

04:25:54.004 --> 04:25:55.973
RAMPS UP YOU HAVE THEM ONGOING

04:25:56.040 --> 04:25:57.107
MONEY BUT IF YOU HAVE BOTH OF

04:25:57.174 --> 04:25:59.109
THESE IN PLACE WHERE YOU GET THE

04:25:59.176 --> 04:26:00.711
SAME AMOUNT OF PRESS T. FUNDING.

04:26:00.778 --> 04:26:01.945
AND TWENTY BILLION ONGOING AND

04:26:02.012 --> 04:26:03.480
POTENTIALLY A LOWER COST MODEL

04:26:03.547 --> 04:26:04.982
THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY

04:26:05.049 --> 04:26:05.616
THEN MAYBE IT TAKES OPERATE THE

04:26:05.683 --> 04:26:06.317
PROGRAM

04:26:06.383 --> 04:26:06.950
OKAY BUT I THINK WERE INFERIORS

04:26:07.017 --> 04:26:08.118
AGREEMENT.

04:26:08.185 --> 04:26:09.586
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE MORE YOU

04:26:09.653 --> 04:26:10.621
IF YOU'RE GONNA START READ

04:26:10.688 --> 04:26:11.822
SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY HAS TO

04:26:11.889 --> 04:26:13.457
BE REVOLUTIONARY AND THE MORE

04:26:13.524 --> 04:26:14.591
YOU TRY AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

04:26:14.658 --> 04:26:16.393
WHAT WE'VE GOT. THE MORE YEAR

04:26:16.460 --> 04:26:18.095
DUPLICATIVE OF THE EFFORTS THAT

04:26:18.162 --> 04:26:20.431
ARE BEING DONE IN THAT BY THE.

04:26:20.497 --> 04:26:22.333
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT EXIST

04:26:22.399 --> 04:26:24.101
SO NOW THAT THAT'S WHY I'M

04:26:24.168 --> 04:26:25.569
SUPPORTIVE OF THE ASSEMBLY MODEL

04:26:25.636 --> 04:26:26.203
WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE AS

04:26:26.270 --> 04:26:29.473
WELL.

04:26:29.540 --> 04:26:31.075
I THINK IN THIS BOOK I'M NOT

04:26:31.141 --> 04:26:31.875
SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF.

04:26:31.942 --> 04:26:34.445
MIGHT A GOOD FRIEND FROM BIG

04:26:34.511 --> 04:26:35.813
BEARS TALK ABOUT REVOLUTION.

04:26:35.879 --> 04:26:35.946
.

04:26:36.013 --> 04:26:39.416
THE.

04:26:39.483 --> 04:26:39.683
I I AM A.

04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:43.854
.

04:26:43.921 --> 04:26:45.656
A BIG CONCERN.

04:26:45.723 --> 04:26:48.025
THAT BOTH THE SENATE AND THE

04:26:48.092 --> 04:26:49.426
ASSEMBLY ARE.

04:26:49.493 --> 04:26:50.928
IN AGREEMENT THAT THE

04:26:50.994 --> 04:26:52.596
ADMINISTRATION'S PROGRAM IS NOT

04:26:52.663 --> 04:26:54.164
THE WAY TO GO BECAUSE.

04:26:54.231 --> 04:26:55.733
I MAKE AND UP SELLING LIKE A

04:26:55.799 --> 04:26:57.034
HERETIC HERE MAYBE A

04:26:57.101 --> 04:26:58.736
REVOLUTIONARY HERETIC BUT I I

04:26:58.802 --> 04:26:59.503
ACTUALLY.

04:26:59.570 --> 04:27:01.905
AND I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH THE

04:27:01.972 --> 04:27:02.773
DIRECTION THAT THE

04:27:02.840 --> 04:27:04.708
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO TAKE ON

04:27:04.775 --> 04:27:07.578
THIS ISSUE. AND. OUTLOOK.

04:27:07.644 --> 04:27:09.380
WERE NOT A REVOLUTIONARY

04:27:09.446 --> 04:27:11.548
ORGANIZATION THAT MOST CASES

04:27:11.615 --> 04:27:11.749
WERE.

04:27:11.815 --> 04:27:14.184
A DELIBERATIVE BODY THAT

04:27:14.251 --> 04:27:16.253
COMPROMISES TO GET THINGS DONE

04:27:16.320 --> 04:27:17.087
AND SO THERE ARE SOME

04:27:17.154 --> 04:27:19.223
COMPROMISES I THINK MOST OF THEM

04:27:19.289 --> 04:27:20.090
ARE ARE.

04:27:20.157 --> 04:27:21.291
A WEALTH.

04:27:21.358 --> 04:27:22.960
WELL THOUGHT OUT AND WELL

04:27:23.026 --> 04:27:25.562
INTENTIONED. A IN IN OTHER MAY

04:27:25.629 --> 04:27:27.698
REVISE PROPOSAL BUT I THINK

04:27:27.765 --> 04:27:29.366
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS

04:27:29.433 --> 04:27:32.202
ISSUE ABOUT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL

04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:33.303
IT IS.

04:27:33.370 --> 04:27:35.973
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

04:27:36.039 --> 04:27:38.675
PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO

04:27:38.742 --> 04:27:40.511
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF INCOME

04:27:40.577 --> 04:27:43.247
INEQUALITY. OF WERE REALLY

04:27:43.313 --> 04:27:45.916
FOCUSED IN WITH THIS PROPOSAL IN

04:27:45.983 --> 04:27:47.017
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOCUSED

04:27:47.084 --> 04:27:48.318
IN. ON.

04:27:48.385 --> 04:27:50.354
A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN

04:27:50.421 --> 04:27:51.955
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE NOT BEING

04:27:52.022 --> 04:27:54.158
SERVED BY THE CURRENT COMMUNITY

04:27:54.224 --> 04:27:55.159
COLLEGE SYSTEM.

04:27:55.225 --> 04:27:57.227
FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT THE

04:27:57.294 --> 04:27:58.662
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DOES.

04:27:58.729 --> 04:28:01.331
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO CAN

04:28:01.398 --> 04:28:02.866
BENEFIT FROM AN ALTERNATIVE

04:28:02.933 --> 04:28:04.401
SYSTEM.

04:28:04.468 --> 04:28:08.672
AND SO I I THINK THIS IS

04:28:08.739 --> 04:28:11.408
SOMETHING THAT REALLY BEARS ARE

04:28:11.475 --> 04:28:12.743
VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL

04:28:12.810 --> 04:28:16.079
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE. THE.

04:28:16.146 --> 04:28:18.415
INEQUALITY THAT WE SEE

04:28:18.482 --> 04:28:20.884
CURRENTLY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS

04:28:20.951 --> 04:28:22.920
IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE WITH

04:28:22.986 --> 04:28:24.188
MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL

04:28:24.254 --> 04:28:25.689
CHANGES THAT WERE SAYING AND WE

04:28:25.756 --> 04:28:27.925
HAVE TO BE. PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S

04:28:27.991 --> 04:28:29.927
IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN KEEP

04:28:29.993 --> 04:28:32.129
UP WITH THAT CHANGE AND WHERE

04:28:32.196 --> 04:28:34.431
MANY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND CAN'T

04:28:34.498 --> 04:28:36.200
CATCH UP AND I THINK THAT THE.

04:28:36.266 --> 04:28:37.434
OTHER THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSAL

04:28:37.501 --> 04:28:43.540
SEEKS TO DO.

04:28:43.607 --> 04:28:47.344
THANK YOU.

04:28:47.411 --> 04:28:52.149
GIPSON NO OTHER COMMENTS.

04:28:52.216 --> 04:28:55.419
WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUES SEVEN.

04:28:55.486 --> 04:29:00.090
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PORTION.

04:29:00.157 --> 04:29:01.725
AND SO THAT'S ON THE ISSUE HERE

04:29:01.792 --> 04:29:03.794
THOUGH THAT MAY REVISE OUR FOR

04:29:03.861 --> 04:29:05.762
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M.

04:29:05.829 --> 04:29:06.230
WAS.

04:29:06.296 --> 04:29:07.865
TO CHANGE THAT THE EXISTING ARE

04:29:07.931 --> 04:29:08.398
COMMITTEE BECAUSE FUNDING

04:29:08.465 --> 04:29:10.033
APPORTIONMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS

04:29:10.100 --> 04:29:12.369
ALMOST ENTIRELY BASED ON A DISC

04:29:12.436 --> 04:29:13.837
FULL TIME EQUIVALENT ENROLLMENT.

04:29:13.904 --> 04:29:15.439
AND AND SHIFT TO A SYSTEM THAT

04:29:15.506 --> 04:29:16.874
WAS SIXTY PERCENT BASED ON

04:29:16.940 --> 04:29:18.642
ENROLLMENT TWENTY PERCENT BASED

04:29:18.709 --> 04:29:19.710
ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME

04:29:19.776 --> 04:29:21.278
STUDENTS AMERICAN ME BECAUSE

04:29:21.345 --> 04:29:23.247
DISTRICT. AND TWENTY PERCENT

04:29:23.313 --> 04:29:24.515
BASED ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

04:29:24.581 --> 04:29:26.450
I MEAN AND THAT INCLUDED A TOTAL

04:29:26.517 --> 04:29:27.985
I'M IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A

04:29:28.051 --> 04:29:30.254
TOTAL OF OUR TWO HUNDRED AND

04:29:30.320 --> 04:29:31.154
SEVENTY NINE MILLION.

04:29:31.221 --> 04:29:33.457
TO ALSO INCLUDE HOLD HARMLESS

04:29:33.524 --> 04:29:34.291
PROVISION SO THAT EVERY

04:29:34.358 --> 04:29:35.859
COMMUNICATIVE DISTRICT WOULD GET

04:29:35.926 --> 04:29:37.227
AT LEAST WHAT THEY GOT IN

04:29:37.294 --> 04:29:39.129
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN GROW BY COST

04:29:39.196 --> 04:29:40.564
OF LIVING. ANSELMO'S HOLD

04:29:40.631 --> 04:29:41.665
HARMLESS PRISONS WOULD PHASE OUT

04:29:41.732 --> 04:29:43.867
OVER TIME BUT THAT WAS THAT THE

04:29:43.934 --> 04:29:45.068
PROPOSAL FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

04:29:45.135 --> 04:29:47.070
THEY ASSEMBLY REJECTS.

04:29:47.137 --> 04:29:48.572
THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA.

04:29:48.639 --> 04:29:50.240
AND THEN DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT

04:29:50.307 --> 04:29:51.942
TO SEVENTY NINE ABOUT THAT'S

04:29:52.009 --> 04:29:52.543

SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

04:29:55.112 --> 04:29:56.513
A BASE INCREASE.

04:29:56.580 --> 04:29:57.981
AND THE FIRST CALL ON THOSE

04:29:58.048 --> 04:29:59.449
FUNDS WOULD BE TO PROVIDE TO

04:29:59.516 --> 04:30:00.350
COLLEGES.

04:30:00.417 --> 04:30:01.985
OR COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS

04:30:02.052 --> 04:30:02.553
WHO WOULD.

04:30:02.619 --> 04:30:03.854
ARE POTENTIALLY DECLINING

04:30:03.921 --> 04:30:05.389
ENROLLMENT AND MY FEET REDUCTION

04:30:05.455 --> 04:30:06.156
IN FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT

04:30:06.223 --> 04:30:07.524
THEY'RE GETTING.

AT LEAST A COLA I'M IN EIGHTEEN

04:30:09.893 --> 04:30:11.495
NINETEEN. ARE AND THEN THE THE

REMAINDER OF THE FUNDING WOULD

04:30:12.863 --> 04:30:14.731
BE AVAILABLE FOR BASS

04:30:14.798 --> 04:30:15.365
APPORTIONMENT INCREASES FOR THE

04:30:15.432 --> 04:30:16.800
COLLEGES.

04:30:16.867 --> 04:30:18.569
I'M THE THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ALSO

04:30:18.635 --> 04:30:19.903
REQUIRES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

04:30:19.970 --> 04:30:22.105
AND TO CREATE A TASK FORCE AND

04:30:22.172 --> 04:30:23.407
REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

04:30:23.473 --> 04:30:24.841
BY MARCH FIRST TO TWENTY

04:30:24.908 --> 04:30:26.443
NINETEEN. ON A NEW FUNDING

04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:28.512
FORMULA. I'M IT AND.

04:30:28.579 --> 04:30:30.480
DUH TASK FORCE WOULD BE

04:30:30.547 --> 04:30:32.249
REQUIRED TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR

04:30:32.316 --> 04:30:33.550
PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

04:30:33.617 --> 04:30:35.185
FOR STUDENTS CERTAIN STUDENT

04:30:35.252 --> 04:30:36.787
POPULATIONS. I'M TO LOOK AT WAYS

04:30:36.853 --> 04:30:38.322
TO MINIMIZE THE VOLATILITY IN

04:30:38.388 --> 04:30:40.090
FUNDING BECAUSE OF.

04:30:40.157 --> 04:30:41.458
UPS AND DOWNS IN ENROLLMENT.

04:30:41.525 --> 04:30:42.659
AND THEN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

04:30:42.726 --> 04:30:44.294
THERE'S NO THAT FUNDING IN

04:30:44.361 --> 04:30:45.128
AGGREGATE IS NO LESS THAN

04:30:45.195 --> 04:30:47.364
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS.

04:30:47.431 --> 04:30:48.899
I'M MOST NOTABLY I WOULD POINT

04:30:48.966 --> 04:30:50.968
OUT THE TASK FORCE IS NOT. TO

04:30:51.034 --> 04:30:52.402
LOOK AT PERFORMANCE BASED ARE A

04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:53.604
PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT IN

04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:55.839
THE FUNDING FROM YOUR.

04:30:55.906 --> 04:30:57.541
I'M THE SENATE REJECTED THE

04:30:57.608 --> 04:30:58.809
FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL AND THEY

04:30:58.875 --> 04:31:00.210
PROVIDE HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION

04:31:00.277 --> 04:31:01.445
DOLLARS IN A BASIC PORTION

04:31:01.511 --> 04:31:03.113
INCREASES.

04:31:03.180 --> 04:31:05.515
I'M YOU KNOW KNOW OUR TASK FORCE

04:31:05.582 --> 04:31:06.283
REQUIREMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE

04:31:06.350 --> 04:31:08.251
THAT SO ISSUE BEFORE. YOU HERE

04:31:08.318 --> 04:31:09.486
IS REALLY DE UM BOTH BOTH HOUSES

04:31:09.553 --> 04:31:11.421
ARE REJECTING THE PROPOSAL BOTH

04:31:11.488 --> 04:31:11.955
A PROVIDING FROM A PORTION

04:31:12.022 --> 04:31:12.990
INCREASES.

04:31:13.056 --> 04:31:14.391
SOME SMALL DIFFERENCES I THINK

04:31:14.458 --> 04:31:16.126
THAT THE BIG. DIFFERENCE IS

04:31:16.193 --> 04:31:17.594
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO LOOK

04:31:17.661 --> 04:31:18.762
INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF IN

04:31:18.829 --> 04:31:19.796
FUTURE YEARS CREATING AND A

04:31:19.863 --> 04:31:21.164
FUNDING FORMULA.

04:31:21.231 --> 04:31:22.633
I'M STARTING A FEW COMMENTS FOR

04:31:22.699 --> 04:31:24.401
US INTO IF YOU DO WANT TO KIND

04:31:24.468 --> 04:31:26.069
OF GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE DO

04:31:26.136 --> 04:31:27.504
THINK THE TASK FORCE APPROACH.

04:31:27.904 --> 04:31:29.272
IT MAKES SENSE THAT WOULD ALLOW

04:31:29.339 --> 04:31:30.407
FOR MORE TIME.

04:31:30.474 --> 04:31:32.275
TO REVIEW THE FORMULAIC

04:31:32.342 --> 04:31:33.744
CONSIDER WHAT WHAT COMPONENTS

04:31:33.810 --> 04:31:35.145
YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED WE KNOW

04:31:35.212 --> 04:31:36.313
THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY

04:31:36.380 --> 04:31:37.514
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS

04:31:37.581 --> 04:31:38.682
THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN

04:31:38.749 --> 04:31:39.850
OUT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

04:31:39.916 --> 04:31:41.518
HOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS TO

04:31:41.585 --> 04:31:43.587
REALLY GET HOOKED A SENSE OF

04:31:43.654 --> 04:31:44.855
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FORMULA?

04:31:44.921 --> 04:31:45.956
TO GO TO GIVEN THAT THE CHANGES

04:31:46.023 --> 04:31:47.290
THAT MAY REVISE ARTISTS PRETTY

04:31:47.357 --> 04:31:48.458
SUBSTANTIAL COMPARED TO THE

04:31:48.525 --> 04:31:49.926
JANUARY PROPOSAL SO YOU DON'T

04:31:49.993 --> 04:31:50.861
REALLY ONLY HAD A FEW WEEKS TOOK

04:31:50.927 --> 04:31:51.294
A LOOK AT THE SPA.

04:31:51.361 --> 04:31:52.329
PROPOSAL.

04:31:52.396 --> 04:31:54.164
I'M.

04:31:54.231 --> 04:31:55.632
THAT THE OTHER ISSUE REPORT OUT

04:31:55.699 --> 04:31:57.401
IS IF THE A IN IN TERMS OF.

04:31:58.301 --> 04:31:59.236
HOLDING DISTRICTS HARM WITH

04:31:59.302 --> 04:32:00.637
ANOTHER'S CONCERNS ABOUT

04:32:00.704 --> 04:32:02.239
PROVIDING SOME CHRISTIAN SOME

04:32:02.305 --> 04:32:03.206
STABILITY A* ABILITY IN THE

04:32:03.273 --> 04:32:04.508
TRANSIT

04:32:04.574 --> 04:32:06.476
TWO AND A FORMULA. ARM WE ARE

04:32:06.543 --> 04:32:08.345
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO

04:32:08.412 --> 04:32:09.012
PROVIDE SOME OF THAT.

04:32:09.079 --> 04:32:11.214
UNPREDICTABILITY IN THE FIRST

04:32:11.281 --> 04:32:12.783
YEARS BUT WE WERE JUST ARE

04:32:12.849 --> 04:32:13.650
RECOMMEND THAT ANY OF THESE

04:32:13.717 --> 04:32:15.152
KINDS HOLE HARNESS PRISON TO BE

04:32:15.218 --> 04:32:16.987
TEMPORARY. ARE AND EVENTUALLY

04:32:17.054 --> 04:32:18.722
FADE OUT ON THE GOAL OF CHANGING

04:32:18.789 --> 04:32:20.123
FUNDING FORMULA IS TO ALIGN WITH

04:32:20.190 --> 04:32:21.692
A POLICY GOAL THAT YOU MIGHT

04:32:21.758 --> 04:32:23.093
HAVE WITH THERE MIGHT BE

04:32:23.160 --> 04:32:23.827
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL.

04:32:23.894 --> 04:32:25.629
FUNDING TO BE BASED ON NEED FOR

04:32:25.696 --> 04:32:26.463
EXAMPLE FOR CERTAIN STERN

04:32:26.530 --> 04:32:28.331
POPULATIONS OR TO PROVIDE

04:32:28.398 --> 04:32:29.399
INCENTIVES FOR.

04:32:29.466 --> 04:32:31.134
IMPROVING PERFORMANCE.

04:32:31.201 --> 04:32:33.637
DOT THAT THE DUMB THE LEAD THE

04:32:33.704 --> 04:32:34.838
LESS YOU LEAVE FOR A HOLD

04:32:34.905 --> 04:32:36.039
HARMLESS THE MORE YOU AVAILABLE

04:32:36.106 --> 04:32:37.774
TO FUND THOSE GOALS I'M SO WE

04:32:37.841 --> 04:32:38.875
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THAT THE

04:32:38.942 --> 04:32:40.644
BILL BE TEMPORARY.

04:32:40.711 --> 04:32:41.678
AND THEN I THINK WE WOULD JUST

04:32:41.745 --> 04:32:42.746
POINT OUT AND IF YOU ARE.

04:32:42.813 --> 04:32:44.281
.

04:32:44.347 --> 04:32:45.115
FOCUSED IF YOU'RE GOING TO

04:32:45.182 --> 04:32:46.783
CONSIDER AYE MAKING CHANGES IN

04:32:46.850 --> 04:32:48.051
LOOKING AT THE BOTTLE SERVICES

04:32:48.118 --> 04:32:49.686
FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS.

04:32:49.753 --> 04:32:51.555
WE DIDN'T WE WROTE A REPORT IN

04:32:51.621 --> 04:32:53.824
DECEMBER ARE OF LAST YEAR AT THE

04:32:53.890 --> 04:32:54.391
REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE

FOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST

04:32:58.395 --> 04:33:00.130
GENERATION STUDENTS ARE IN IN

04:33:00.197 --> 04:33:01.031
THE ENTIRE HARITH SYSTEM BUT WE

04:33:01.098 --> 04:33:03.166
HAD. SUCH A COMMUNITY COLLEGES

04:33:03.233 --> 04:33:04.835
AND THERE WE TALKED ABOUT THE

04:33:04.901 --> 04:33:06.470
THE POTENTIAL FOR A STREAMLINING

04:33:06.536 --> 04:33:07.938
EXISTING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS

04:33:08.004 --> 04:33:09.806
THAT THAT EXIST AND POTENTIALLY

04:33:09.873 --> 04:33:11.308
LOOKING AT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

04:33:11.375 --> 04:33:12.909
THAT COLLAPSES THE. ATOM SOMOS

04:33:12.976 --> 04:33:14.611
PROGRAMS WOULD PROVIDE SOME

04:33:14.678 --> 04:33:16.146
FLEXIBILITY WITH STREAMLINED

04:33:16.213 --> 04:33:17.447
PLANNING FOR COLLEGES WOULD

04:33:17.514 --> 04:33:18.782
REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

04:33:18.849 --> 04:33:20.517
AND IMPROVE COORDINATION AT THE

04:33:20.584 --> 04:33:22.786

.

04:35:56.539 --> 04:35:58.708
IT INSTILLS.

AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

04:36:05.482 --> 04:36:06.716
AND I WOULD CONCUR THAT. MY

04:36:06.783 --> 04:36:08.118
OPINION WOULD BE THAT THE MAY

04:36:08.184 --> 04:36:11.521
REVISE SOMEWHAT UNDERMINES AT.

04:36:11.588 --> 04:36:13.089
MAYBE NOT ENOUGH TO SAY NO TO

SO WOULD YOU KIND OF CALL OF THE

04:36:22.165 --> 04:36:22.766
MIXED PERFORMANCE.

04:36:22.832 --> 04:36:25.135
.

04:36:25.201 --> 04:36:28.405
MISS COST IT NOW.

04:36:28.471 --> 04:36:30.507
THE.

04:36:30.573 --> 04:36:32.142
PART WILL STILL BE FULL TIME

04:36:32.208 --> 04:36:33.743
EQUIVALENT.

04:36:33.810 --> 04:36:35.645
BASED.

04:36:35.712 --> 04:36:37.614
AND THEN IT THE OTHER THAN YOU.

04:36:37.681 --> 04:36:39.916
PROGRAM OUT.

04:36:39.983 --> 04:36:41.584
THE TENANTS FIFTY PERCENT.

04:36:41.651 --> 04:36:43.553
AND THEN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE

04:36:43.620 --> 04:36:45.588
IS THAT THE BALLOT OUR PROPOSAL

04:36:45.655 --> 04:36:46.790
IS SIXTY PERCENT WOULD BE

04:36:46.856 --> 04:36:48.525
DISTRIBUTED BASED ON ENROLLMENT

04:36:48.591 --> 04:36:50.160
SO SOMEWHERE TO HAVE TEA WHICH

04:36:50.226 --> 04:36:51.461
IS KIND OF THE BASE DOLLAR

04:36:51.528 --> 04:36:52.796
AMOUNTS THAT WE PROVIDE TO

04:36:52.862 --> 04:36:53.897
COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

04:36:53.964 --> 04:36:55.031
TWENTY PERCENT WOULD BE BASED ON

04:36:55.098 --> 04:36:55.899
ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME

04:36:55.966 --> 04:36:57.434
STUDENTS

04:36:57.500 --> 04:36:58.635
AND THE FINAL TWENTY PERCENT

04:36:58.702 --> 04:37:00.603
WOULD BE BASED ON PERFORMANCE OR

04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:02.505
STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS WHAT'S A

04:37:02.572 --> 04:37:04.741
BLENDED MODEL.

04:37:04.808 --> 04:37:06.409
ONE OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO

04:37:06.476 --> 04:37:07.978
COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR A LONG

04:37:08.044 --> 04:37:09.546
TIME HAS BEEN.

04:37:09.612 --> 04:37:10.180
THAT.

04:37:10.246 --> 04:37:11.481
FULL TIME EQUIVALENT.

04:37:11.548 --> 04:37:13.483
AND.

04:37:13.550 --> 04:37:16.753
SCHOOLS.

04:37:16.820 --> 04:37:17.754
PUTTING TOGETHER CLASS IS SIMPLY

04:37:17.821 --> 04:37:18.822
THE.

04:37:18.888 --> 04:37:22.592
HELP PEOPLE ENROLLED.

04:37:22.659 --> 04:37:24.027
FOR LONG TIME I'VE OBJECTED TO

04:37:24.094 --> 04:37:25.128
THAT.

04:37:25.195 --> 04:37:27.797
CONCEPT.

04:37:27.864 --> 04:37:29.733
AND IT SEEMED LIKE TO ME THAT

04:37:29.799 --> 04:37:31.301
THIS ONLINE.

04:37:31.368 --> 04:37:33.937
IT'S A PLACE TO START.

04:37:34.004 --> 04:37:36.106
NOT JUST FOR THOSE PURPOSES BUT

04:37:36.172 --> 04:37:39.876
TO BROADEN. THE POPULATION.

04:37:39.943 --> 04:37:41.211
ANYWAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE

04:37:41.277 --> 04:37:43.113
MORE. BENEFICIAL THAN JUST

04:37:43.179 --> 04:37:44.280
INVENTING.

04:37:44.347 --> 04:37:46.716
SCHOOL BY SCHOOL.

04:37:46.783 --> 04:37:47.617
CLASSES TO GAIN FULL TIME

04:37:47.684 --> 04:37:50.253
EQUIVALENT.

04:37:50.320 --> 04:37:53.123
WHAT DROVE THE GOVERNOR'S?

04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.590
PASSION FOR THIS.

04:37:54.257 --> 04:37:58.161
THIS NEW APPROACH.

04:37:58.228 --> 04:37:59.596
WELL THERE'S WE'VE YOU THESE

04:37:59.662 --> 04:38:00.430
PROPOSALS IS REALLY

04:38:00.497 --> 04:38:02.098
COMPLIMENTARY TO ONE ANOTHER SO

04:38:02.165 --> 04:38:03.400
THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:38:03.466 --> 04:38:05.135
PROPOSAL REALLY TARGETS A GROUP

04:38:05.201 --> 04:38:06.870
OF STUDENTS THAT TRADITIONALLY

04:38:06.936 --> 04:38:08.104
HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED.

04:38:08.171 --> 04:38:09.672
SOME OF THE INITIAL FEEDBACK WE

04:38:09.739 --> 04:38:11.408
HEARD IS THAT SOME DISTRICTS

04:38:11.474 --> 04:38:13.143
WORRIED AND IN EMPLOYMENT BASED

04:38:13.209 --> 04:38:15.512
FUNDING MODEL WE WERE

04:38:15.578 --> 04:38:17.914
POTENTIALLY DECREASING THEIR

04:38:17.981 --> 04:38:19.649
FUNDING BY SERVING THE STUDENTS

04:38:19.716 --> 04:38:21.751
IN AN ONLINE MANNER.

04:38:21.818 --> 04:38:23.186
BY HAVING A PERFORMANCE BASED

04:38:23.253 --> 04:38:24.320
MODEL YOU DON'T HAVE DISTRICTS

04:38:24.387 --> 04:38:25.622
HAVING THOSE DISAGREEMENTS

04:38:25.688 --> 04:38:27.090
INSTEAD YOU'RE FOCUSING

04:38:27.157 --> 04:38:28.725
DISTRICTS ON ACTUALLY AND

04:38:28.792 --> 04:38:30.860
MEETING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS

04:38:30.927 --> 04:38:32.529
OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS.

04:38:32.595 --> 04:38:33.863
AND SO WE REALLY DO YOU VIEW THE

04:38:33.930 --> 04:38:35.765
ON LINE AND THE ENROLLMENTS.

04:38:35.832 --> 04:38:37.400
OR THE MOVE FROM A PURELY

04:38:37.467 --> 04:38:38.668
ENROLLMENT BASE MODEL AS

04:38:38.735 --> 04:38:40.236
COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES ON

04:38:40.303 --> 04:38:42.138
ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE ONLINE

04:38:42.205 --> 04:38:43.740
COLLEGE WOULD BE HELD TO THE

04:38:43.807 --> 04:38:45.642
SAME PERFORMANCE METRICS.

04:38:45.708 --> 04:38:47.777
WHERE WERE REALLY IT'S A SEISMIC

04:38:47.844 --> 04:38:49.079
SHIFT IN LOOKING AT?

04:38:49.145 --> 04:38:50.513
WITHIN THE COMMUNICABLE JUST

04:38:50.580 --> 04:38:51.714
THE MANY DIFFERENT MISSIONS THEY

04:38:51.781 --> 04:38:54.517
SERVE AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE

04:38:54.584 --> 04:38:56.419
FUNDING THEM. UP FOR MEETING

04:38:56.486 --> 04:38:58.354
THOSE GOALS OF THE STUDENTS BOTH

04:38:58.421 --> 04:39:00.023
IN THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AND

04:39:00.090 --> 04:39:00.557
AND THE BRICKS AND MORTAR

04:39:00.623 --> 04:39:06.663
SCHOOLS.

04:39:06.729 --> 04:39:09.165
SELECT.

04:39:09.232 --> 04:39:11.935
SIR MORE.

04:39:12.001 --> 04:39:13.036
COMMISSION CHAIR I JUST.

04:39:13.103 --> 04:39:14.204
IT WAS FOR THE SAKE OF MISS

04:39:14.270 --> 04:39:15.839
COSTED WANNA SAY THAT I DO

04:39:15.905 --> 04:39:18.708
SUPPORT THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA.

04:39:18.775 --> 04:39:21.044
AND VOTED. FOR THAT'S I THINK

04:39:21.111 --> 04:39:23.513
MISTER CHAIR OUT WE NEED TO

04:39:23.580 --> 04:39:24.214
MAYBE.

04:39:24.280 --> 04:39:27.350
LOOK AT WHAT OUR STRATEGY WILL

04:39:27.417 --> 04:39:29.419
BE FOR STRUGGLING DISTRICTS AND

04:39:29.486 --> 04:39:30.353
I'M JUST WONDERING.

04:39:30.420 --> 04:39:31.821
IF FIVE MISS COSTA WOULD LIKE TO

04:39:31.888 --> 04:39:35.825
COMMENT ON THAT.

04:39:35.892 --> 04:39:37.861
WHAT I THINK SIMILAR TO?

04:39:37.927 --> 04:39:39.662
ARE APPROACH ON THE K. TWELVE

04:39:39.729 --> 04:39:40.230
SIDE WE'VE.

04:39:40.296 --> 04:39:43.032
UTILIZE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING

04:39:43.099 --> 04:39:44.300
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL

04:39:44.367 --> 04:39:45.802
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR UNIQUE

04:39:45.869 --> 04:39:47.270
CHALLENGES.

04:39:47.337 --> 04:39:48.571
IN A THINK THIS DOES GET INTO

04:39:48.638 --> 04:39:50.273
THE ISSUE OF WITH AND THE NINETY

04:39:50.340 --> 04:39:51.741
EIGHT PACKAGE.

04:39:51.808 --> 04:39:54.077
WHAT'S ON GOING WHAT'S ONE TIME

04:39:54.144 --> 04:39:55.612
IN NATURE AND WHAT'S PROVIDE

04:39:55.678 --> 04:39:56.679
WHAT PROVIDES MAXIMUM

04:39:56.746 --> 04:39:59.149
FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL DISTRICTS.

04:39:59.215 --> 04:40:01.351
WE PUT ADEQUATE A SIGNIFICANT

04:40:01.417 --> 04:40:03.520
AMOUNT IN OUR PROPOSAL HIGH IN

04:40:03.586 --> 04:40:05.054
DISCRETIONARY.

04:40:05.121 --> 04:40:07.357
RESOURCES I'M ASSOCIATED WITH

04:40:07.423 --> 04:40:08.591
OUR FUNDING FORMULA THIS IS

04:40:08.658 --> 04:40:10.160
REALLY FLEXIBLE DOLLARS BY

04:40:10.226 --> 04:40:12.128
HOLDING THEM HARMLESS IT GIVES

04:40:12.195 --> 04:40:15.198
THEM GREAT DISCRETION ON HOW TO

04:40:15.265 --> 04:40:16.966
FEND HOW TO SPEND THESE FUNDS.

04:40:17.033 --> 04:40:18.134
AND I THINK YOUR CHANCES ARE

04:40:18.201 --> 04:40:19.402
VERY SUPPORTIVE AS WELL SO I'M

04:40:19.469 --> 04:40:21.137
SURE HE'LL BE BACK.

04:40:21.204 --> 04:40:22.472
NEXT YEAR WITH THE SAME.

04:40:22.539 --> 04:40:23.773
RECOMMENDATION.

04:40:23.840 --> 04:40:29.746
THAT CORRECT.

04:40:29.812 --> 04:40:30.813
I'M NOT SURE I'M FOLLOWING YOUR

04:40:30.880 --> 04:40:32.482
QUESTION WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO

04:40:32.549 --> 04:40:34.517
THE ONLINE FUNDING PROPOSAL AND

04:40:34.584 --> 04:40:35.585
HOPE FOR ITS INCLUSION AND I

04:40:35.652 --> 04:40:36.186
THOUGHT I'D DROP ONLINE AND

04:40:36.252 --> 04:40:39.155
TALKING ABOUT YOUR AND FUNDING

04:40:39.222 --> 04:40:40.223
FORMULA YOUR FUNDING FORMULA.

04:40:40.290 --> 04:40:40.723
SO.

04:40:40.790 --> 04:40:42.659
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

04:40:42.725 --> 04:40:43.593
YOU'RE FOCUSED ON STUDENT

04:40:43.660 --> 04:40:45.728
OUTCOMES AND I CONCUR WITH MY.

04:40:45.795 --> 04:40:46.829
COLLEAGUE FROM PAYMENT THANK YOU

04:40:46.896 --> 04:40:54.871
MISTER CHAIR.

04:40:54.938 --> 04:40:56.839
I'M GONNA TAKE DECIDE PROVIDENT

04:40:56.906 --> 04:40:58.541
AND DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

04:40:58.608 --> 04:41:01.644
THE.

04:41:01.711 --> 04:41:03.379
HAVE YOU SHOULD IN ALL THE

04:41:03.446 --> 04:41:05.848
DISCUSSIONS ON IT AND.

04:41:05.915 --> 04:41:07.483
ON HIGHER ED TO RELATIONSHIP.

04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:10.620
BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY AND

04:41:10.687 --> 04:41:11.888
THE IN ON THIS NUMBER OUT THERE

04:41:11.955 --> 04:41:13.022
AND HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE NEED TO

04:41:13.089 --> 04:41:14.724
HAVE DEGREES.

04:41:14.791 --> 04:41:16.893
DO YOU HAVE A.

04:41:16.960 --> 04:41:18.628
DID YOU WITH INCOME INEQUALITY.

04:41:18.695 --> 04:41:20.463
WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT

04:41:20.530 --> 04:41:21.831
HOW CAN WE HELP PEOPLE GET JOBS

04:41:21.898 --> 04:41:22.999
HOW CAN YOU GET. DEVELOP THE

04:41:23.066 --> 04:41:25.034
MIDDLE CLASS.

04:41:25.101 --> 04:41:27.604
HOW DO WE GET THE SKILLS WE NEED?

04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:29.806
AND THE WORLD ECONOMY.

04:41:29.872 --> 04:41:30.873
SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE CHANGING

04:41:30.940 --> 04:41:32.208
RAPIDLY.

04:41:32.275 --> 04:41:34.177
AND I THINK OUR.

04:41:34.244 --> 04:41:36.212
CONCEPT OF.

04:41:36.279 --> 04:41:37.947
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BE IN A

04:41:38.014 --> 04:41:39.882
PLACE TO GET IN A A.

04:41:39.949 --> 04:41:41.751
AND TRANSFERRING TO WAS CE AS

04:41:41.818 --> 04:41:45.388
YOU'D BEGIN TO BE A OR B. S..

04:41:45.455 --> 04:41:46.522
BECAUSE WHEN I ATTENDED A

04:41:46.589 --> 04:41:48.291
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE MAJORITY

04:41:48.358 --> 04:41:51.261
OF US DID THAT.

04:41:51.327 --> 04:41:52.895
BUT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT IT WHAT'S.

04:41:52.962 --> 04:41:55.531
ILLEGAL BY WHAT'S PERCENT OF.

04:41:55.598 --> 04:41:57.500
GRADUATES.

04:41:57.567 --> 04:41:59.102
OR ATTENDEES OF THE COMMUNITY

04:41:59.168 --> 04:42:01.070
COLLEGES ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO

04:42:01.137 --> 04:42:03.573
ISSUES YOU ARE YOU SAY.

04:42:03.640 --> 04:42:04.874
TO GET HIRED TO GET A BACHELORS

04:42:04.941 --> 04:42:07.877
DEGREE.

04:42:07.944 --> 04:42:09.912
WHEN RUNNING RATHER.

04:42:09.979 --> 04:42:10.980
I DON'T THINK THAT NUMBER BUT

04:42:11.047 --> 04:42:12.081
IT'S LESS THAN HALF OF STUDENT I

04:42:12.148 --> 04:42:12.682
WAS GONNA SAY IS LESSEN TWENTY

04:42:12.749 --> 04:42:14.217
PERCENT.

04:42:14.284 --> 04:42:16.753
AND SO IT'S NOT A BIG GROUP.

04:42:16.819 --> 04:42:18.388
WHICH WAS IT THE SAME ONE I

04:42:18.454 --> 04:42:19.722
TENDED OF COMMUNICABLE JUNE

04:42:19.789 --> 04:42:21.658
NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. SO SO THIS

04:42:21.724 --> 04:42:24.093
CHANGED.

04:42:24.160 --> 04:42:24.694
AS I WAS TOLD THE STORY SEVEN

04:42:24.761 --> 04:42:24.961
PERCENT.

04:42:25.028 --> 04:42:26.763
OKAY.

04:42:26.829 --> 04:42:28.097
SO THE.

04:42:28.164 --> 04:42:29.699
SO THERE'S A.

04:42:29.766 --> 04:42:31.968
AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

04:42:32.035 --> 04:42:33.236
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT NEEDS

04:42:33.303 --> 04:42:34.037
WITHIN SOCIETY WHAT WE'RE TRYING

04:42:34.103 --> 04:42:35.972
TO DO SO I THINK WHAT THE

04:42:36.039 --> 04:42:36.873
CHANCES TRYING TO DO AT THE

04:42:36.939 --> 04:42:38.675
COMMUNITY COLLEGES NEW VISION IS

04:42:38.741 --> 04:42:40.677
FIGURING OUT. WHAT IS THE ROLE

04:42:40.743 --> 04:42:43.346
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES?

04:42:43.413 --> 04:42:44.514
WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF

04:42:44.580 --> 04:42:45.948
EXPERIMENTS AROUND THE STATE IN

04:42:46.015 --> 04:42:47.083
MY OWN DISTRICT AMERICA'S TO

04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:48.751
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

04:42:48.818 --> 04:42:50.953
IS GIVING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE TO

04:42:51.020 --> 04:42:52.422
WORK IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

04:42:52.488 --> 04:42:54.223
INDUSTRY BECAUSE. THE COMMUNITY

04:42:54.290 --> 04:42:55.525
COLLEGES PARTYING WITH THE

04:42:55.591 --> 04:42:58.428
INDUSTRY TO GIVE THE NEEDS.

04:42:58.494 --> 04:42:59.729
TO THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW

04:42:59.796 --> 04:43:00.363
TECHNICIANS WORK IN

04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:02.231
PHARMACEUTICALS.

04:43:02.298 --> 04:43:03.700
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO UC SAN

04:43:03.766 --> 04:43:07.570
DIEGO TO WORK IN THE

04:43:07.637 --> 04:43:08.104
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

04:43:08.171 --> 04:43:08.705
SO THAT YOU MANY COLLEGE FILL

04:43:08.771 --> 04:43:10.707
THAT ROLE NOW I KNOW WE HAVE THE

04:43:10.773 --> 04:43:12.342
NUMBERS YOU MANY COLLEGES DOING

04:43:12.408 --> 04:43:14.077
IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

04:43:14.143 --> 04:43:15.812
SOME ARE GOOD AND SOME SOME OF

04:43:15.878 --> 04:43:17.480
MARK DOING SO WELL THIS VERY

04:43:17.547 --> 04:43:19.048
SMALL NUMBERS STUDENTS TAKING

04:43:19.115 --> 04:43:20.917
ADVANTAGE IN THE MODERN MONEY WE

04:43:20.983 --> 04:43:22.618
PUT INTO IT PROBABLY ISN'T GIVEN

04:43:22.685 --> 04:43:24.721
AS THE RATE OF RETURN WE WANT.

04:43:24.787 --> 04:43:25.888
BUT I THINK THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE

04:43:25.955 --> 04:43:27.056
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO REDESIGN

04:43:27.123 --> 04:43:28.558
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:43:28.624 --> 04:43:29.892
SO.

04:43:29.959 --> 04:43:31.894
I.

04:43:31.961 --> 04:43:34.330
CHANGES REALLY TOUGH.

04:43:34.397 --> 04:43:36.299
AND SO IN THE DISCUSSION WE HAD

04:43:36.366 --> 04:43:38.501
AND IN EDUCATION.

04:43:38.568 --> 04:43:40.703
IT WAS ALWAYS A DISCUSSION ABOUT.

04:43:40.770 --> 04:43:42.705
AND I HAD A NUMBER OF THE.

04:43:42.772 --> 04:43:44.240
.

04:43:44.307 --> 04:43:45.975
OF THE FACULTY.

04:43:46.042 --> 04:43:47.877
MEMBERS ATTEND COME TO MY OFFICE

04:43:47.944 --> 04:43:49.212
AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

04:43:49.278 --> 04:43:50.546
BEING MEASURED FOR SUCCESS BEING

04:43:50.613 --> 04:43:51.848
EVALUATED.

04:43:51.914 --> 04:43:53.249
AND THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ARE YOU

04:43:53.316 --> 04:43:54.484
GONNA VALUE IT MEANS HOUSING

04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:56.352
TEACH CLASSES BECAUSE I'M

04:43:56.419 --> 04:43:58.521
TEACHING STUDENTS TO.

04:43:58.588 --> 04:43:59.889
PROBABLY WON'T A SUCCESSFUL IN

04:43:59.956 --> 04:44:01.891
HIGH SCHOOL SO THEY DIDN'T GO TO

04:44:01.958 --> 04:44:03.559
SEE ISSUE WOULD HOLD ME DIRE

04:44:03.626 --> 04:44:05.294
STAND SO THERE.

04:44:05.361 --> 04:44:06.829
TEACHERS ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE

04:44:06.896 --> 04:44:07.363
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE

04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:08.631
EVALUATED

04:44:08.698 --> 04:44:10.433
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT. ABOUT WHAT

04:44:10.500 --> 04:44:12.602
THEY ARE. SO.

04:44:12.668 --> 04:44:14.404
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:15.605
GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE.

04:44:15.671 --> 04:44:17.707
.

04:44:17.774 --> 04:44:19.609
TO THE. TO THE FACULTY BECAUSE

04:44:19.675 --> 04:44:20.977
ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

04:44:21.043 --> 04:44:23.079
I THINK WE INDICATE MANY

04:44:23.146 --> 04:44:24.480
COLLEGES WE REALLY UNDER FUNDED

04:44:24.547 --> 04:44:25.848
IT. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT

04:44:25.915 --> 04:44:28.985
VERY MANY FULL TIME FACULTY.

04:44:29.051 --> 04:44:30.553
HOW MANY FULL TIME FACULTY HAVE

04:44:30.620 --> 04:44:31.587
INCOMMUNICADO EDGES AVERAGE AND

04:44:31.654 --> 04:44:34.791
WE KNOW THAT ONE?

04:44:34.857 --> 04:44:36.125
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC TOTAL

04:44:36.192 --> 04:44:37.593
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTY

04:44:37.660 --> 04:44:39.429
SIX PERCENT OF THE FACULTY OR

04:44:39.495 --> 04:44:41.531
FULL TIME FACULTY WHEN WHEN DONE

04:44:41.597 --> 04:44:44.200
BY FDA OUT SO QUICKLY.

04:44:44.267 --> 04:44:44.834
ABOUT ANYTHING IS THAT I EITHER

04:44:44.901 --> 04:44:46.969
BUT OKAY BUT.

04:44:47.036 --> 04:44:49.105
MY POINT IS YOU USED TO BE WHAT

04:44:49.172 --> 04:44:50.406
I WOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

04:44:50.473 --> 04:44:52.141
IN A JUNIOR COLLEGE CALL THEN A

04:44:52.208 --> 04:44:53.676
LOT OF THE FACULTY OR FULL TIME

04:44:53.743 --> 04:44:54.844
AND THEY HAD OFFICE HOURS YOU

04:44:54.911 --> 04:44:56.279
COULD. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE

04:44:56.345 --> 04:44:57.847
IT WAS A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT

04:44:57.914 --> 04:44:59.849
THAN IT IS TODAY.

04:44:59.916 --> 04:45:00.850
AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS

04:45:00.917 --> 04:45:02.585
WOMAN IS BAD THIS IS A DIFFERENT

04:45:02.652 --> 04:45:04.620
ROLE THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES

04:45:04.687 --> 04:45:05.221
ARE PLAYING WITH IN SOCIETY.

04:45:05.288 --> 04:45:06.989
SO I THINK.

04:45:07.056 --> 04:45:09.292
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF GOING BACK IN

04:45:09.358 --> 04:45:11.294
LOOKING AT.

04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:12.762
HOLDEN THIS WEEK HOLDEN THIS.

DISCUSSION IN MEETING TO FIGURE

04:45:14.597 --> 04:45:15.998
OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AND

04:45:16.065 --> 04:45:17.800
IF IN THE FUTURE.

04:45:17.867 --> 04:45:18.668
BECAUSE THE.

04:45:18.734 --> 04:45:20.403
NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO

04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:22.371
TRANSFER TO BERKELEY TO GET THE

04:45:22.438 --> 04:45:24.106
FRENCH LITERATURE DEGREE SO WE

CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ARE

04:45:34.884 --> 04:45:35.418
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEM. BUT

04:45:35.485 --> 04:45:37.053
THE.

04:45:37.119 --> 04:45:39.422
SO I THINK THE WE NEED TO ALLOW

04:45:39.489 --> 04:45:41.424
THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO

04:45:41.491 --> 04:45:43.292

TIME TO GO BACK AND RE. READ

04:45:44.327 --> 04:45:46.162
LOOK AT IT.

04:45:46.229 --> 04:45:48.698
WE DO KNOW. BACK OFF.

04:45:48.764 --> 04:45:50.399
THAT EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION

04:45:50.466 --> 04:45:52.401
IS A KEY COMPONENT FOR GOOD JOBS

04:45:52.468 --> 04:45:54.403
FOR CALIFORNIANS.

04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:56.606
AND WE HAVE SOME REAL.

04:45:56.672 --> 04:45:58.374
INEQUALITIES IN THE STATE.

04:45:58.441 --> 04:46:00.009
AND WE GOTTA GET IT RIGHT AND I

04:46:00.076 --> 04:46:01.677

YOU GOTTA GO BACK WORK ON A BIT

04:46:02.411 --> 04:46:04.814
MORE. I THINK BECAUSE THE

04:46:04.881 --> 04:46:06.215
CHANCES RIGHT GOT TO DO THIS.

04:46:06.282 --> 04:46:07.617
ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD IN AND

04:46:07.683 --> 04:46:09.619
FIGURE IT OUT.

04:46:09.685 --> 04:46:10.653
IN THIS CHANGE IS HARD.

04:46:10.720 --> 04:46:12.455
HELLO.

04:46:12.522 --> 04:46:13.189
I WOULD JUST NOT ON THE

04:46:13.256 --> 04:46:14.824
PERFORMANCE SIDE OF THE FUNDING

04:46:14.891 --> 04:46:16.826
FORMULA WE DO YOU TRY TO

04:46:16.893 --> 04:46:18.794
INCORPORATE THE MULTITUDE OF

04:46:18.861 --> 04:46:20.363
MISSIONS THAT THE COMMUNICATIVE

04:46:20.429 --> 04:46:23.032
SERVES THERE ARE. MEASURES FOR

04:46:23.099 --> 04:46:24.600
ADT ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR

04:46:24.667 --> 04:46:26.502
TRANSFER BUT CERTIFICATES AS

04:46:26.569 --> 04:46:29.138
WELL AND WE REALLY TRIED TO WAY

04:46:29.205 --> 04:46:29.605
THAT.

04:46:29.672 --> 04:46:32.041
TO YOUR EARLIER POINT KIMMY

04:46:32.108 --> 04:46:33.342
COLLEGES DO YOU SERVE AS A

04:46:33.409 --> 04:46:34.911
TRANSFER PATHWAY FOR SOME

04:46:34.977 --> 04:46:36.579
STUDENTS BUT FOR OTHER STUDENTS

04:46:36.646 --> 04:46:38.848
IT'S THE AND. AN AREA TO GET A

04:46:38.915 --> 04:46:40.116
CERTIFICATE WERE TO REACH OTHER

04:46:40.182 --> 04:46:42.251
EDUCATIONAL GOALS SO WE DID TRY

04:46:42.318 --> 04:46:44.387
TO INCORPORATE THAT IN THE AND

04:46:44.453 --> 04:46:46.589
STUDENT PERFORMANCE SECTION OF

04:46:46.656 --> 04:46:48.391
THE FUNDING FORMULA.

04:46:48.457 --> 04:46:48.991
AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE

04:46:49.058 --> 04:46:50.326
AYE ALLY TH HOPEFULLY THIS

04:46:50.393 --> 04:46:51.928
DISCUSSION OF THE TRANSPARENT.

04:46:51.994 --> 04:46:53.596
YOU KNOW THE KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM

04:46:53.663 --> 04:46:54.964
COULD DEVELOP A DASHBOARD WITH

04:46:55.031 --> 04:46:56.465
THERE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE I'D

04:46:56.532 --> 04:46:58.234
IMAGINE SOMETIME TO COMMUNITY

04:46:58.301 --> 04:46:59.335
COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE.

04:46:59.402 --> 04:47:00.703
THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY SO

04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:02.405
PEOPLE LOOK AT SAY.

04:47:02.471 --> 04:47:03.706
YOU GET DEGREES OUT THE SCHOOL

04:47:03.773 --> 04:47:05.074
OR YOU GO TO AMERICA BECAUSE

04:47:05.141 --> 04:47:06.008
THEY NEED TO BE WORKED IN THE

04:47:06.075 --> 04:47:07.610
PHARMACEUTICAL SO. PEOPLE WILL

04:47:07.677 --> 04:47:09.045
HAVE.

04:47:09.111 --> 04:47:11.213
AN EXPECTATION OF WHAT'S GOING

04:47:11.280 --> 04:47:13.716
ON AT THAT. TOO MANY COLLEGES IN

04:47:13.783 --> 04:47:15.551
YUBA CITY COLLEGE MAY BE TOTALLY

04:47:15.618 --> 04:47:16.319
DIFFERENT THAN AMERICA'S

04:47:16.385 --> 04:47:17.820
DOMINICAL.

04:47:17.887 --> 04:47:19.355
AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I THINK

04:47:19.422 --> 04:47:20.756
IT'S RELATION BETWEEN THE

04:47:20.823 --> 04:47:23.092
COLLEGES EXACTLY THAT.

04:47:23.159 --> 04:47:25.895
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

04:47:25.962 --> 04:47:28.664
USED TO BE A JUNIOR COLLEGE THAT

04:47:28.731 --> 04:47:29.231
WHEN I TENDED NOW WE'LL CALL

04:47:29.298 --> 04:47:30.600
THAT.

04:47:30.666 --> 04:47:33.002
IT'S IS MUNITY COLLEGE I THINK

04:47:33.069 --> 04:47:33.636
THERE'S A REASON WE CHANGED THE

04:47:33.703 --> 04:47:37.807
NAME.

04:47:37.873 --> 04:47:39.742
ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

04:47:40.943 --> 04:47:43.079
FORMULAIC APPROACHES TO FUNDING

04:47:43.145 --> 04:47:45.081
IN FOR EXAMPLE K. THROUGH TWELVE

04:47:45.147 --> 04:47:46.449
WE REQUIRE.

04:47:46.515 --> 04:47:47.984
DISTRICTS TO HAVE A PLAN AND IN

04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:49.285
THE PLAN HAS CERTAIN REVIEW

04:47:49.352 --> 04:47:51.621
ELEMENTS IN.

04:47:51.687 --> 04:47:53.255
IN OF SUBJECT TO

04:47:53.322 --> 04:47:54.824
EVALUATING HAD DISTRICTS USED

04:47:54.890 --> 04:47:56.292
THE MONEY GIVEN THE.

04:47:56.359 --> 04:47:58.060
ATTENUATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

04:47:58.127 --> 04:47:59.662
OUR STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN

04:47:59.729 --> 04:48:01.097
THESE VERY CAN BREEZE COMMUNITY

04:48:01.163 --> 04:48:03.566
COLLEGE DISTRICTS THEM.

04:48:03.633 --> 04:48:04.400
IN THE STATE MAYBE I MISSED THIS

04:48:04.467 --> 04:48:06.369
BUT WHO DECIDES HOW THIS OF

04:48:06.435 --> 04:48:07.603
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT MONEY IS

04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:08.604

AND WHO.

04:48:10.640 --> 04:48:13.242
AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR.

04:48:13.309 --> 04:48:14.577
ADJUSTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF

04:48:14.644 --> 04:48:16.278
THE MONEY IF

04:48:16.345 --> 04:48:18.914
SOMEONE WHO EVER THAT IS OR SOME

04:48:18.981 --> 04:48:20.483
GROUP DECIDES THAT IT ISN'T

04:48:20.549 --> 04:48:21.884
SPENT APPROPRIATELY. IS THAT A

04:48:21.951 --> 04:48:25.154
FAIR QUESTION.

04:48:25.221 --> 04:48:26.155

I STUDENT SUCCESS AT METRICS

04:48:48.377 --> 04:48:48.611
SO.

04:48:48.678 --> 04:48:52.114
AT THE PROPOSAL REQUIRES. LOCAL

04:48:52.181 --> 04:48:54.083
DISTRICTS TO INCORPORATE THOSE

IN THEIR MASTER PLANS AND TO

04:48:55.685 --> 04:48:57.553
ALIGN THEIR BUDGETS WAITED AT

04:48:59.021 --> 04:49:00.122
SCHOOLS AND SPECIFY HOW THEY'RE

04:49:00.189 --> 04:49:01.924
MAKING PROGRESS ON. ON THE

04:49:01.991 --> 04:49:04.326
SPECIFIC METRICS I'D ON HOW TO

04:49:04.393 --> 04:49:05.828
SPEND THE FUNDS THAT STILL A

04:49:05.895 --> 04:49:07.496
LOCAL FLEXIBILITY BUT WE'RE

04:49:07.563 --> 04:49:09.398
TRYING TO DO HERE IS HAVE LOCALS

04:49:09.465 --> 04:49:10.666
REALLY A LINE.

04:49:10.733 --> 04:49:13.602
THEIR THEIR LOCAL GOALS WITH AT

04:49:13.669 --> 04:49:15.838
THE STATE WHITE HOUSE AND AT

04:49:15.905 --> 04:49:18.207
VARIOUS SUCCESS AREAS. WHERE AS

04:49:18.274 --> 04:49:19.909
YOU MAY KNOW I WASN'T I DIDN'T?

04:49:19.975 --> 04:49:21.010
DO NOT SIT ON A BUDGET

04:49:21.077 --> 04:49:22.845
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HEARD ANY OF

04:49:22.912 --> 04:49:24.046
THESE

04:49:24.113 --> 04:49:25.614
CARE ISSUES AND SO. I'M SOMEWHAT

04:49:25.681 --> 04:49:27.016
UNFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE

04:49:27.083 --> 04:49:28.851
DETAIL BUT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS

04:49:28.918 --> 04:49:30.653
PART OF THIS PROCESS AND AS PART

04:49:30.720 --> 04:49:32.388
OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IS

04:49:32.455 --> 04:49:34.156
THERE SOME PLAN TO ACCUMULATE

04:49:34.223 --> 04:49:36.392
DATA TO TRY TO MATCH UP THE.

04:49:36.459 --> 04:49:37.727
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL

04:49:37.793 --> 04:49:39.295
GRANT MONEY WITH EDUCATIONAL

04:49:39.361 --> 04:49:40.763
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS THAT WHAT THE

04:49:40.830 --> 04:49:42.565
STUDENT SUCCESS DOZEN IS THE

04:49:42.631 --> 04:49:44.366
DATA AGGREGATED IN IS THE DATA

04:49:44.433 --> 04:49:45.735
THEN MADE AVAILABLE TO OF THE

04:49:45.801 --> 04:49:47.737
STATE'S CHANCES OFFICER TO US OR

04:49:47.803 --> 04:49:50.539
TO BOTH. TO EVALUATE WHETHER.

04:49:50.606 --> 04:49:52.441
THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT IS

04:49:52.508 --> 04:49:53.809
EFFECTIVE OR NOT AGE AS I THINK

04:49:53.876 --> 04:49:55.444
I AM.

04:49:55.511 --> 04:49:57.513
CLEAR THIS IS CURRENTLY A DEBATE

04:49:57.580 --> 04:49:58.581
THAT'S GOING ON IN THE K.

04:49:58.647 --> 04:49:59.982
THROUGH TWELVE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT

04:50:00.049 --> 04:50:02.184
NOW AS TO WHETHER. SUPPLEMENTAL

04:50:02.251 --> 04:50:03.986
CONCENTRATION GRANTS OR THE

04:50:04.053 --> 04:50:05.154
APPROPRIATE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE

04:50:05.221 --> 04:50:07.256
MONEY AS OPPOSED TO THE BASE

04:50:07.323 --> 04:50:09.258
GRANT ITSELF IS THAT.

04:50:09.325 --> 04:50:11.160
THAT'S A QUESTION I THINK

04:50:11.227 --> 04:50:12.394
SOMEWHAT ONE DISTINCTION I WANT

04:50:12.461 --> 04:50:13.863
TO MAKE IT SEEM THE TWO SYSTEMS

04:50:13.929 --> 04:50:14.563
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

04:50:14.630 --> 04:50:15.798
ALISON I TALKED ABOUT.

04:50:15.865 --> 04:50:18.434
REALLY EARLY ON IS THE K.

04:50:18.501 --> 04:50:19.502
TWELVE THAT COMPULSORY.

04:50:19.568 --> 04:50:21.103
SYSTEM AND THIS OBVIOUSLY IS

04:50:21.170 --> 04:50:21.904
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF

04:50:21.971 --> 04:50:23.572
HIGHER EDUCATION.

04:50:23.639 --> 04:50:26.208
MECHANICALLY APPORTIONMENT GO

04:50:26.275 --> 04:50:27.610
THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

04:50:27.676 --> 04:50:28.544
AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO

04:50:28.611 --> 04:50:30.312
CALCULATE THE PERFORMANCE

04:50:30.379 --> 04:50:31.947
METRICS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE

04:50:32.014 --> 04:50:33.449
ENROLLMENT FACTORS THAT WE'VE

04:50:33.516 --> 04:50:35.384
BUILT INTO THE FUNDING FORMULA.

04:50:35.451 --> 04:50:37.453
AND SADAT HOW THE COLLEGES BUT

04:50:37.520 --> 04:50:39.121
ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE FUNDS THAT

04:50:39.188 --> 04:50:40.623
GOES THROUGH THE SAME

04:50:40.689 --> 04:50:42.091
MECHANIZATION IT DOES NOW JUST

04:50:42.158 --> 04:50:42.892
THE FACTORS THAT THE

04:50:42.958 --> 04:50:43.793
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD

04:50:43.859 --> 04:50:45.895
DETERMINE ARE DIFFERENT. THAN

04:50:45.961 --> 04:50:46.762
JUST PURELY ENROLLMENTS

04:50:46.829 --> 04:50:49.932
OKAY.

04:50:49.999 --> 04:50:51.400
BECAUSE I MY ADDED IN TERMS OF

04:50:51.467 --> 04:50:52.201
COMPARING THE THINGS I THINK

04:50:52.268 --> 04:50:53.169
THIS IN THE THIS PROPOSAL HAS A

04:50:53.235 --> 04:50:54.537
LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY AT THE

04:50:54.603 --> 04:50:55.171
COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL BECAUSE

04:50:55.237 --> 04:50:56.505
THAT. THERE ISN'T THE SAME

04:50:56.572 --> 04:50:57.940
REQUIREMENT THERE BE A CERTAIN

04:50:58.007 --> 04:50:59.975
PERCENT INCREASE IN SERVICES

04:51:00.042 --> 04:51:01.610
PROVIDED TO STUDENTS.

04:51:01.677 --> 04:51:03.412
THAT ARE PROUD THAT OUR SERVER

04:51:03.479 --> 04:51:05.347
LOW INCOME BUT I THINK THAT THEY

04:51:05.414 --> 04:51:06.348
DIEM PART WITH THE FORMULA IS%

04:51:06.415 --> 04:51:07.783
THAT THEY'RE. THEY'RE USING THAT

04:51:07.850 --> 04:51:09.418
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IT INSURERS

04:51:09.485 --> 04:51:11.620
THAT AS A RESPONSE TO HAVING A

04:51:11.687 --> 04:51:13.923
PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT YOU

04:51:13.989 --> 04:51:15.491
DON'T HAVE COLLEGES THAT ARE SAY.

04:51:15.558 --> 04:51:17.326
TRYING NOT TO SERVE LOW INCOME

04:51:17.393 --> 04:51:18.327
STUDENTS TO GET THEIR

04:51:18.394 --> 04:51:19.428
PERFORMANCE NUMBERS UP RIGHT WE

04:51:19.495 --> 04:51:21.397
WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

WHEN THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR.

04:52:44.313 --> 04:52:46.415
HOW DO WE MEASURE WHETHER A

HAS THERE BEEN THAT'S QUESTION

04:52:56.825 --> 04:52:58.093
ONE AND THAT SORT OF A COMPOUND

04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.995
WHEN IS THERE SOME MECHANISM NOW

THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED TO TIE AND.

04:53:02.598 --> 04:53:04.033
THE A DENTED T. OF A PARTICULAR

RECEIVING.

04:53:19.949 --> 04:53:22.084
IS THAT.

04:53:22.151 --> 04:53:24.219
FAIR QUESTION OVER CHRIS

04:53:24.286 --> 04:53:25.454
FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK

04:53:25.521 --> 04:53:27.256
THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION UP WHAT

04:53:27.323 --> 04:53:29.058
IT THEY ARE DOING TODAY TO

04:53:29.124 --> 04:53:30.392

04:53:30.459 --> 04:53:32.294
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WORKS WITH.

04:53:42.371 --> 04:53:44.106
A SOFT MATCH BETWEEN THE

04:53:47.743 --> 04:53:48.911
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE

04:53:50.479 --> 04:53:51.613
OBTAINING.

04:53:51.680 --> 04:53:53.182
THE OTHER ASPECT OF THAT THAT I

04:53:53.248 --> 04:53:54.249
WOULD ADD IS THE COMMUNITY

04:53:54.316 --> 04:53:55.884
COLLEGE SYSTEM DOES HAVE WHAT

TO LOOK AT A PARTICULAR PROGRAM

04:54:07.463 --> 04:54:08.931
AND HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING

04:54:08.998 --> 04:54:10.799
FROM THE START OF WHAT TYPE OF

04:54:10.866 --> 04:54:12.301
WAGE YOU COULD EXPECT FROM

04:54:12.368 --> 04:54:15.137
COMPLETING THAT PROGRAM.

04:54:15.204 --> 04:54:17.072
I UNDERSTAND I I HOPE THAT WE'RE

04:54:17.139 --> 04:54:18.640
ABLE TO.

04:54:18.707 --> 04:54:19.775
FINE TUNE THIS.

04:54:19.842 --> 04:54:21.910
PERFORMANCE METRICS SO WE ARE

04:54:21.977 --> 04:54:23.912
FRANKLY ABLE TO OBTAIN A VERY

04:54:23.979 --> 04:54:25.214
ACCURATE FAIRLY ACCURATE REPORT

04:54:25.280 --> 04:54:26.548
ON.

WHETHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:54:27.850 --> 04:54:28.050
GRADUATES.

.

04:54:29.785 --> 04:54:31.587
RECEIVE A REGIONAL LIVING WAGE

04:54:31.653 --> 04:54:32.921
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

04:54:32.988 --> 04:54:34.923
EXPANDED BOTH TO THE C. ISSUE IN

04:54:34.990 --> 04:54:37.059
THE UC BECAUSE I THINK THE FOLKS

04:54:37.126 --> 04:54:38.627
THAT RUN THOSE INSTITUTIONS.

04:54:38.694 --> 04:54:40.362
HAVE ARE AN OBLIGATION TO THE

TAXPAYERS BUT CERTAINLY AN

04:54:41.697 --> 04:54:42.998
OBLIGATION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS

04:54:43.065 --> 04:54:45.000
WHO WERE STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE

04:54:45.067 --> 04:54:47.169
THE VALUE ADDED. OF THE COLLEGE

04:54:47.236 --> 04:54:49.204
EXPERIENCE AND AND THE WAY I

04:54:49.271 --> 04:54:50.672
UNDERSTAND THEY ARE CURRENTLY

04:54:50.739 --> 04:54:52.274
DOING THIS FOR THE MOST PART. IS

04:54:52.341 --> 04:54:53.776
ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THROUGH

04:54:53.842 --> 04:54:56.245
ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS WHICH.

04:54:56.311 --> 04:54:58.447
GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS

04:55:00.282 --> 04:55:02.418
ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN A.

04:55:02.484 --> 04:55:03.719
SIZEABLE GENERAL FUND BUDGET WE

04:55:03.786 --> 04:55:05.154
GOTTA FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO

04:55:05.220 --> 04:55:07.389
SKIN THAT CAT SO GOOD LUCK TO

MASTER PLAN HAS BEEN MENTIONED

04:55:25.207 --> 04:55:27.109
HERE.

04:55:27.176 --> 04:55:28.243
I THINK IT WAS A MORE NARROW.

04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:29.878
.

04:55:29.945 --> 04:55:31.947
TAILORED AFTER THE AT THAT

04:55:32.014 --> 04:55:33.248
MASTER PLAN I THINK FINANCE WAS

04:55:33.315 --> 04:55:34.950
SUGGESTING THAT WHAT I'M GOING

04:55:35.017 --> 04:55:36.518
TO THE REFER TO.

04:55:36.585 --> 04:55:37.653
AND THAT IS A MASTER PLAN FOR

04:55:37.719 --> 04:55:38.253
HIGHER EDUCATION.

04:55:38.320 --> 04:55:38.921
THAT.

04:55:38.987 --> 04:55:41.256
WAS

04:55:41.323 --> 04:55:43.525
FIRST IMPLEMENTED UNDER GOVERNOR

04:55:43.592 --> 04:55:45.527
BROWN. PAT BROWN.

04:55:45.594 --> 04:55:46.328
AND REVISED IN THE NINETEEN

04:55:46.395 --> 04:55:48.197
EIGHTIES.

04:55:48.263 --> 04:55:49.965
AND THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN I WOULD

04:55:50.032 --> 04:55:51.400
ARGUE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT

04:55:51.467 --> 04:55:53.869
MASTER PLAN.

04:55:53.936 --> 04:55:55.370
SOME THINGS AREN'T THOUGH AND

04:55:55.437 --> 04:55:57.639
THAT WOULD BE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

04:55:57.706 --> 04:55:59.408
BECOMING FOUR YEAR DEGREE

04:55:59.475 --> 04:56:01.844
OFFERING COLLEGES.

04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:03.378
I AM VERY RESISTANT TO THAT.

04:56:03.445 --> 04:56:05.814
BUT WE'VE THE.

04:56:05.881 --> 04:56:07.216
WE'D WE'VE HAD THAT THE WHOLE

04:56:07.282 --> 04:56:08.417
REASON FOR THE REVIEW OF ASPEN

04:56:08.484 --> 04:56:10.285
WAS IN EIGHTY THREE WAS BECAUSE

04:56:10.352 --> 04:56:12.554
OF. THE CREEPING.

04:56:12.621 --> 04:56:15.591
THE.

04:56:15.657 --> 04:56:17.893
SO I GUESS THE OTHER DIFFERENT.

04:56:17.960 --> 04:56:19.261
THE INSTITUTIONS THE.

04:56:19.328 --> 04:56:21.230
CS YOU.

04:56:21.296 --> 04:56:22.164
WAS WANTING TO GET INTO DR ED

04:56:22.231 --> 04:56:25.167
EDUCATION.

04:56:25.234 --> 04:56:26.935
AND YOU SEE INTO.

04:56:27.002 --> 04:56:29.238
TEACHING TEACHERS LET'S PUT VERY

04:56:29.304 --> 04:56:31.573
SIMPLY ORIGINALLY THE CSU SYSTEM

04:56:31.640 --> 04:56:34.009
WAS CALLED TEACHERS COLLEGE.

04:56:34.076 --> 04:56:37.312
WELL THAT WAS THAT CONFUSION.

04:56:37.379 --> 04:56:39.148
I FELT IF WE LEFT TO GO IT WOULD

04:56:39.214 --> 04:56:40.082
RAIN.

04:56:40.149 --> 04:56:41.183
STRONG AND.

04:56:41.250 --> 04:56:43.218
REALLY

04:56:43.285 --> 04:56:45.087
HEART HURT HIGHER EDUCATION O

04:56:45.154 --> 04:56:46.021
THE MASTER PLAN HAS BEEN A GOOD.

04:56:46.088 --> 04:56:48.123
TAYLOR.

04:56:48.190 --> 04:56:49.992
AND THE DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE

04:56:50.058 --> 04:56:50.792
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD

04:56:50.859 --> 04:56:52.427
ALWAYS KEEP THE MASTER PLAN.

04:56:52.494 --> 04:56:54.196
IN MY.

04:56:54.263 --> 04:56:56.598
THE ASSEMBLY OF VERSION OFFERS A

04:56:56.665 --> 04:57:01.036
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION NOW.

04:57:01.103 --> 04:57:02.471
THAT'S BASED ON WHAT THE

04:57:02.538 --> 04:57:04.473
APPORTIONMENT THE HUNDRED AND

04:57:04.540 --> 04:57:07.042
SEVENTY FIVE IS THAT SIMPLY.

04:57:07.109 --> 04:57:09.111
GIVEN THAT IT IS A POOR AMOUNT

04:57:09.178 --> 04:57:12.014
OR IS BASED ON SOME CALCULATION.

04:57:12.080 --> 04:57:13.515
IS THERE SOME FULL TIME

04:57:13.582 --> 04:57:15.384
EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR THE HUNDRED

04:57:15.450 --> 04:57:16.185
SEVENTY FIVE.

04:57:16.251 --> 04:57:18.854
MILLION.

04:57:18.921 --> 04:57:20.322
SO THE ASSEMBLY AMOUNT BUT I

04:57:20.389 --> 04:57:22.057
THINK I'M TO THAT THE FIRST CALL

04:57:22.124 --> 04:57:23.759
WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT. SINCE

04:57:23.825 --> 04:57:24.226
IT TO CREATE ANOTHER.

04:57:24.293 --> 04:57:25.060
.

04:57:25.127 --> 04:57:25.527
TO.

THOMAS BUT TO PROVIDE FIRST.

04:57:35.037 --> 04:57:36.138
FURTHER IT'S LIKE THEM FROM

04:57:36.205 --> 04:57:37.706
REDUCTION VAN WHATEVER WOULD BE

04:57:37.773 --> 04:57:40.209
LEFT OVER WOULD BE UTILIZED TO

04:57:40.275 --> 04:57:41.843
PROVIDE AN ACROSS THE BOARD.

04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:43.478
PRESS T. INCREASE FOR

THE THAT BASS INCREASE WOULD

04:57:46.515 --> 04:57:47.816
DEPEND ON HOW SERVE WHATTHE

05:04:17.739 --> 05:04:18.807
SPECIFYING THE MIX OF

05:04:18.873 --> 05:04:19.341
UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE

05:04:19.407 --> 05:04:20.575
STUDENTS.

05:04:20.642 --> 05:04:22.510
EVERYTHING HERE AS FOLLOWS.

05:04:22.577 --> 05:04:24.713
IT LOOKING OUT OVER FOR BEEN

05:04:24.779 --> 05:04:25.614
PROJECTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOL

05:04:25.680 --> 05:04:27.148
GRADUATES UP PERSONAL GRADUATES

05:04:27.215 --> 05:04:28.683
ARE PROJECTED TO GROW VERY MUCH

05:04:28.750 --> 05:04:30.552
IN FACT THEIR SPECTRA DECLINE IN

05:04:30.619 --> 05:04:32.554
THAT YEAR VERY SLIGHTLY.

05:04:32.621 --> 05:04:33.521
I'M BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK

05:04:33.588 --> 05:04:33.722
THAT.

05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:35.323
SOME LOWER GROWTH JUST AS IT IS

05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:36.858
JUSTIFIED.

05:04:36.925 --> 05:04:38.159
NO THAT'S SAID ON ASSEMBLY

05:04:38.226 --> 05:04:39.961
MEMBER SCHABAS AND.

05:04:40.028 --> 05:04:41.396
SEVERAL OTHER VIEW HAVE HAVE

05:04:41.463 --> 05:04:42.731
POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S THIS

05:04:42.797 --> 05:04:44.132
MASTER PLAN AND PART OF THE

05:04:44.199 --> 05:04:45.734
MASTER PLAN.

05:04:45.800 --> 05:04:47.335
IS EXHORT OF CONSIDERS A MOMENT

05:04:47.402 --> 05:04:49.137
ALL THREE SEGMENTS AND RELIES

05:04:49.204 --> 05:04:50.105
VERY HEAVILY ON THE TRANSFER

05:04:50.171 --> 05:04:51.740
FUNCTION AND HISTORICALLY

05:04:51.806 --> 05:04:53.975
STUDENTS TO OF A DON'T DON'T

05:04:54.042 --> 05:04:55.043
MAKE IT TO YOU SINCE YOUR ISSUE

05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:56.478
AS FRESHMEN. SO HAVE THE

05:04:56.544 --> 05:04:57.912
OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND COMMUNITY

05:04:57.979 --> 05:04:59.280
COLLEGE AND WORK THEIR WAY

05:04:59.347 --> 05:05:00.715
THROUGH THE TRANSFER PROCESS.

05:05:00.782 --> 05:05:02.517
WE THINK THAT STILL THERE STILL

05:05:02.584 --> 05:05:04.419
RATIONALE THERE ON. COSTS ARE

05:05:04.486 --> 05:05:06.087
STILL A LOWER AT COMMUNITY

05:05:06.154 --> 05:05:07.889
COLLEGES AND SO PROVIDE STUDENTS

05:05:07.956 --> 05:05:09.524
THE OPPORTUNITY TRANSFER TO UC

05:05:09.591 --> 05:05:11.126
AND CSU.

05:05:11.192 --> 05:05:12.560
AND FURTHERMORE IN RECENT YEARS

05:05:12.627 --> 05:05:14.229
AND MOMENT COMMUTER COLLEGES AS

05:05:14.295 --> 05:05:15.630
BELOW SORT OF ITS PEAK YEARS SO

05:05:15.697 --> 05:05:16.931
WE THINK THERE'S SOME.

05:05:16.998 --> 05:05:18.633
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY A COMMUNITY

05:05:18.700 --> 05:05:19.234
COLLEGES TO OBSERVE ENROLLMENT

05:05:19.300 --> 05:05:20.301
GROWTH.

05:05:20.368 --> 05:05:21.336
BUT THAT'S A THAT IS A KEY

05:05:21.403 --> 05:05:22.170
CONSIDERATION FOR U. S.

05:05:22.237 --> 05:05:23.838
REFACTORING YOUR HOME DECISIONS

05:05:23.905 --> 05:05:25.306
HOW THAT WILL IMPACT TO TAKE IT

05:05:25.373 --> 05:05:26.174
ROAMING ACROSS ALL THREE

05:05:26.241 --> 05:05:27.676
SEGMENTS. AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU

05:05:27.742 --> 05:05:28.777
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE

05:05:28.843 --> 05:05:30.211
TO RELY HEAVILY ON THE TRANSFER

05:05:30.278 --> 05:05:32.247

SLOTS FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS.

05:05:35.316 --> 05:05:36.284
OUR THINKING IT ON A NOT

SPECIFYING THE MIX OF

05:05:37.185 --> 05:05:38.453
UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE STUDENTS

05:05:38.520 --> 05:05:39.654
IS JUST THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE

05:05:39.721 --> 05:05:41.122
THE UNIVERSITY SOME FLEXIBILITY

05:05:41.189 --> 05:05:43.425

05:05:46.895 --> 05:05:50.598
INSTRUCTION OF THE OF THE GROSS.

05:05:50.665 --> 05:05:52.067
THE THIRD ISSUE IS FUNDING FOR

05:05:52.133 --> 05:05:54.169
OVER BUDGET ENROLLMENT THIS IS

05:05:54.235 --> 05:05:55.437
FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO ADD A

05:05:55.503 --> 05:05:55.670
ADDRESS.

05:05:55.737 --> 05:05:57.105
.

05:05:57.172 --> 05:05:57.872
AND WOMAN LEVELS THAT HAVE

05:05:57.939 --> 05:05:59.874
EXCEEDED A FUNDED TARGETS IN THE

05:05:59.941 --> 05:06:01.176
STATE BUDGET IN RECENT YEARS

05:06:01.242 --> 05:06:01.676
SPOT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

05:06:01.743 --> 05:06:03.111

05:06:04.746 --> 05:06:04.879
FIVE.

05:06:04.946 --> 05:06:06.848
I'M SORRY THE CENTER PROVIDES

05:06:06.915 --> 05:06:08.116
TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THAT

05:06:08.183 --> 05:06:10.185
PURPOSE THE SIMPLY PROVIDES HALF

05:06:10.251 --> 05:06:10.785
THAT AMOUNT TWELVE AND A HALF

05:06:10.852 --> 05:06:12.353
MILLION.

05:06:12.420 --> 05:06:13.922
WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY AMOUNT

05:06:13.988 --> 05:06:14.923
ON THIS CASE A TWELVE AND A HALF

05:06:14.989 --> 05:06:17.492
MILLION OUR OUR THINKING IS THAT.

05:06:17.559 --> 05:06:18.693
ALL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOUSES

05:06:18.760 --> 05:06:20.128

INCREASES IN THE GOVERNOR AND

05:06:23.531 --> 05:06:25.266
THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALSO.

05:06:25.333 --> 05:06:26.701
IDENTIFIED OTHER SAVINGS I CAN

05:06:26.768 --> 05:06:28.136
REDIRECT TOWARDS BUDGET AND IS

05:06:28.203 --> 05:06:29.437
ADOPTING NON RESIDENT TUITION

05:06:29.504 --> 05:06:31.005
INCREASES AND THESE FUNDS ARE

05:06:31.072 --> 05:06:31.873
AVAILABLE TO COVER A VARIETY OF

05:06:31.940 --> 05:06:33.241
COSTS.

05:06:33.308 --> 05:06:35.009
AT THE UNIVERSITY INCLUDING

05:06:35.076 --> 05:06:36.444
COMPENSATION CRITICISM ROMAN

05:06:36.511 --> 05:06:37.412
GROWTH FOR THE UNIVERSITY ALSO

05:06:37.479 --> 05:06:38.613
HAS PLANS TO USE SOME OF THIS

05:06:38.680 --> 05:06:40.081
FUNDING AS WELL TO REDUCE

05:06:40.148 --> 05:06:40.982
STUDENT THE STUDENT FACULTY

05:06:41.049 --> 05:06:42.684
RATIO. WHICH WE UNDERSTAND TO BE

05:06:42.751 --> 05:06:45.420
A KICK REASON FOR THIS. ISSUE AS

05:06:45.487 --> 05:06:47.055
WELL SO WE THINK GIVEN ALL THOSE

05:06:47.122 --> 05:06:48.623
NOTABLE AUGMENTATIONS WHO EITHER

05:06:48.690 --> 05:06:49.958
THE LOWER AMOUNT IS JUSTIFIED IN

05:06:50.024 --> 05:06:51.626
THIS CASE.

05:06:51.693 --> 05:06:53.094
AND FINALLY ON NON RESIDENT ROLE

05:06:53.161 --> 05:06:55.497
MEANT THE SENATE ADOPTS A PLAYER

05:06:55.563 --> 05:06:56.064

05:06:56.131 --> 05:06:57.398
LANGUAGE.

05:06:57.465 --> 05:06:59.300
TO DIRECT YOU SEE TO DEVELOP A

05:06:59.367 --> 05:07:01.269
PLAN TO REDUCE. A NONRESIDENT

ROMAN OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

05:07:03.438 --> 05:07:03.872
AS PART OF THE PLAN THE

05:07:03.938 --> 05:07:04.405
UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO

05:07:04.472 --> 05:07:06.307
IDENTIFY FUND SOURCES TO COVER

05:07:06.374 --> 05:07:07.776
THE. A FOREGONE REVENUES

05:07:07.842 --> 05:07:08.810
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DECLINE

05:07:08.877 --> 05:07:10.812
ENROLLMENT.

05:07:10.879 --> 05:07:12.447
THE COLONEL YOU SEE DOES HAVE A

05:07:12.514 --> 05:07:13.715
POLICY THAT LIMITS NON RESIDENT

05:07:13.782 --> 05:07:15.683
ROLL MEANT. A FOR A SEVERAL

05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:16.951
CAMPUSES WERE NON RESIDENT

05:07:17.018 --> 05:07:18.086
MOMENTS NOTABLY HYATT KINDA

05:07:18.153 --> 05:07:19.220
LOCKS THE PROPORTIONS IN IN

05:07:19.287 --> 05:07:20.922
PLACE AND FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

05:07:20.989 --> 05:07:22.323
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE MUCH LOWER

05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:23.591
LEVELS OF NON RESIDENT MOMENT.

05:07:23.658 --> 05:07:25.727
PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM

05:07:25.794 --> 05:07:27.295
TO INCREASE THEIR PROPORTIONS.

05:07:27.362 --> 05:07:28.763
BUT THE SENATE A ROCK REPORT

05:07:28.830 --> 05:07:30.465
WOULD WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO DO IS

05:07:30.532 --> 05:07:31.299
DEVELOP A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY

05:07:31.366 --> 05:07:32.500
REQUIRES REDUCTIONS IN NON

05:07:32.567 --> 05:07:33.635
RESIDENT WOMAN FROM MOST OF

05:07:33.701 --> 05:07:35.870
THOSE CAMPUSES.

05:07:35.937 --> 05:07:36.805
SO THE KEY ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS

05:07:36.871 --> 05:07:37.739
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE SATISFIED

05:07:37.806 --> 05:07:39.440

PREDICATED ON WHAT I REVENUES

05:08:15.977 --> 05:08:17.078

05:08:28.323 --> 05:08:29.824
ONGOING COST PRESSURES WITHIN

05:08:29.891 --> 05:08:31.526

LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIR WAS EVEN

05:09:54.509 --> 05:09:54.809
MENTIONED TODAY.

05:09:54.876 --> 05:09:56.044
.

05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:59.147
AND ONE OF MY EMAIL.

05:09:59.213 --> 05:10:00.581
THAT I BUT I GET FROM MY CAL

05:10:00.648 --> 05:10:03.818
MATTERS FROM A DAMN MARINE BUT.

05:10:03.885 --> 05:10:05.787
AT THIS IS WORK ON.

05:10:05.853 --> 05:10:06.988
BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE UC

05:10:07.055 --> 05:10:08.356
SYSTEM.

05:10:08.423 --> 05:10:08.823
AND.

05:10:08.890 --> 05:10:10.325
HAVE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

05:10:10.391 --> 05:10:11.859
PLAN WAS ADOPTED AND IT'S BEEN

05:10:11.926 --> 05:10:14.195
PART OF THEIR. A REGULAR

05:10:14.262 --> 05:10:15.063
NEGOTIATIONS.

05:10:15.129 --> 05:10:17.932
MEET AND CONFER IT CETERA.

05:10:17.999 --> 05:10:20.702
SOME WILL CONCERNED BY TRYING TO.

05:10:20.768 --> 05:10:22.236
MODIFY THIS.

05:10:22.303 --> 05:10:23.071
THROUGH A BUDGET.

05:10:23.137 --> 05:10:24.872
ACT.

05:10:24.939 --> 05:10:26.641
WE KNOW THAT.

05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:29.410
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE.

05:10:29.477 --> 05:10:31.079
PORTABLE IT HELPFUL WE

05:10:31.145 --> 05:10:32.847
CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF.

05:10:32.914 --> 05:10:35.817
MOVEMENT AND EMPLOYMENT SO THAT

05:10:35.883 --> 05:10:37.552
FEATURES REALLY HELPFUL. HOW WE

05:10:37.618 --> 05:10:39.487
DO KNOW FROM HISTORY NOW THAT

05:10:39.554 --> 05:10:40.922
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE

05:10:40.989 --> 05:10:42.490
UNSUSTAINABLE?

05:10:42.557 --> 05:10:44.492
IT WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR

05:10:44.559 --> 05:10:45.660
OLD SCHOOL DISTRICT SCISSOR.

05:10:45.727 --> 05:10:46.961
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MEETING

05:10:47.028 --> 05:10:48.629
THESE INCREASED.

05:10:48.696 --> 05:10:49.964
PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS.

05:10:50.031 --> 05:10:51.966
RIGHT NOW.

05:10:52.033 --> 05:10:54.235
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF UC

05:10:54.302 --> 05:10:55.837
EMPLOYEES I BELIEVE ARE

05:10:55.903 --> 05:10:58.539
UTILIZING THAT DC OPPORTUNITY I.

05:10:58.606 --> 05:11:00.308
I THINK THAT'S THE FUTURE WE

05:11:00.375 --> 05:11:01.676
SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY STRINGING.

05:11:01.743 --> 05:11:04.679
OUR INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION.

05:11:04.746 --> 05:11:06.581
BY FORCING MORE EXPENSIVE

05:11:06.647 --> 05:11:08.282
SOLUTIONS

05:11:08.349 --> 05:11:09.817
AND OPPORTUNITIES ON THEM I

05:11:09.884 --> 05:11:11.719
THINK THAT SKINNER ONLY BACKFIRE

05:11:11.786 --> 05:11:13.254
ON US. AND WILL COME BACK TO

05:11:13.321 --> 05:11:14.622
HAUNT THIS.

05:11:14.689 --> 05:11:16.024
STATE BECAUSE ARE GONNA COME

05:11:16.090 --> 05:11:17.125
BACK AND SAY OKAY YOU'VE YOU

05:11:17.191 --> 05:11:18.526
MADE US DO THIS NOW YOU PAY FOR

05:11:18.593 --> 05:11:19.861
IT BECAUSE.

05:11:19.927 --> 05:11:22.096
WE MADE OUR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS

05:11:22.163 --> 05:11:23.664
AND NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE CHANGING

05:11:23.731 --> 05:11:25.600
THEM SO I SEE IT AS A. AS MAY BE

05:11:25.666 --> 05:11:27.435
UP FISCAL TRAIN WRECK ON THE ON

05:11:27.502 --> 05:11:28.469
THE HORIZON AND MAYBE EVEN AN

05:11:28.536 --> 05:11:30.505
INSULT TO. GOVERNOR BROWN FOR

05:11:30.571 --> 05:11:32.607
ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT HE'S

05:11:32.673 --> 05:11:34.308
READY INVESTED. IN FACT.

05:11:34.375 --> 05:11:36.144
.

05:11:36.210 --> 05:11:37.512
THE LAST TIME I WAS WITH THE

05:11:37.578 --> 05:11:39.614
GOVERNOR AT AND AT A DINNER HE

05:11:39.680 --> 05:11:41.215
HAD TWO MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE

05:11:41.282 --> 05:11:42.750
FUTURE ONE BEING.

05:11:42.817 --> 05:11:44.419
CLIMATE CHANGE THE OTHER BEING

05:11:44.485 --> 05:11:45.853
THE PENSION PLAN.

05:11:45.920 --> 05:11:47.889
CONCERNS IN THE UNFUNDED.

05:11:47.955 --> 05:11:50.224
LIABILITIES SO I SEE THIS

05:11:50.291 --> 05:11:51.959
RECOMMENDATION IS IS GOING IN

05:11:52.026 --> 05:11:53.061
THE WRONG DIRECTION AND. AND

05:11:53.127 --> 05:11:54.996
MISTER CHAIR.

05:11:55.063 --> 05:11:56.330
AND YOU KNOW AGAIN REVIEWING THE

05:11:56.397 --> 05:11:57.899
COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

05:11:57.965 --> 05:12:00.001
REPORTS OF THE. UC SYSTEM THE

05:12:00.068 --> 05:12:02.170
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

05:12:02.236 --> 05:12:03.871
KAFFIR HAS AN UNRESTRICTED NET

05:12:03.938 --> 05:12:06.707
DEFICIT. OF ELEVEN BILLION WE

05:12:06.774 --> 05:12:09.343
JUST GOT THERE. JONES SEVENTEEN

05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:11.946
KAFFIR RECENTLY IT'S NOW DOWN TO

05:12:12.013 --> 05:12:14.382
A AT NINETEEN BILLION DEFICIT IN

05:12:14.449 --> 05:12:15.950
ITS GROWING.

05:12:16.017 --> 05:12:19.487
AND THE BUDGET.

05:12:19.554 --> 05:12:20.888
SUMMARY OR EXECUTIVE REPORT EVEN

05:12:20.955 --> 05:12:22.557
MENTIONED THAT.

05:12:22.623 --> 05:12:25.159
THE UC SYSTEM HAS NINETEEN

05:12:25.226 --> 05:12:27.328
BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFUNDED

05:12:27.395 --> 05:12:28.529
RETIREE MEDICAL THAT HAS NOT

05:12:28.596 --> 05:12:30.064
REPORTED.

05:12:30.131 --> 05:12:31.532
AS OF YET ON THE BALLOT SHEET

05:12:31.599 --> 05:12:32.633
THAT WILL BE COMING ON THIS NEXT

05:12:32.700 --> 05:12:34.435
MONTH.

05:12:34.502 --> 05:12:36.304
SO WHEN WE GET THE JUNE.

05:12:36.370 --> 05:12:38.639
THIRTY EIGHT TEAM KAFFIR FROM

05:12:38.706 --> 05:12:40.007
THE UC SYSTEM MIDDLE BE UPSIDE

05:12:40.074 --> 05:12:41.342
DOWN THIRTY EIGHT. BILLION

05:12:41.409 --> 05:12:43.144
DOLLARS.

05:12:43.211 --> 05:12:45.480
SO I I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

05:12:45.546 --> 05:12:47.181
THAT WE CAN BE CAREFUL ABOUT

05:12:47.248 --> 05:12:49.016
WHAT WE DO THE UC SYSTEM WE HAD

05:12:49.083 --> 05:12:50.785
A BILL LAST YEAR. FORCING THEM

05:12:50.852 --> 05:12:52.453
TO HIRE CERTAIN.

05:12:52.520 --> 05:12:54.288
OUTSIDE VENDORS BUT AT THE SAME

05:12:54.355 --> 05:12:56.090
RATES THAT WE WOULD CHARGE IT IF

05:12:56.157 --> 05:12:57.625
THE IF YOU HAD.

05:12:57.692 --> 05:12:58.626
THE EMPLOYEES YOURSELVES WITH

05:12:58.693 --> 05:13:00.161
THAT'S NOT HELPING MANAGEMENT AT

05:13:00.228 --> 05:13:01.662
ALL SO I I THINK WE JUST NEED TO

05:13:01.729 --> 05:13:02.930
BE A LITTLE CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW

05:13:02.997 --> 05:13:04.565
WE TREAT.

05:13:04.632 --> 05:13:05.366
THIS SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY'RE

05:13:05.433 --> 05:13:06.701
GONNA COME BACK TO US START

05:13:06.767 --> 05:13:08.169
DEMANDING A LOT OF MONEY.

05:13:08.236 --> 05:13:08.803
AND.

05:13:08.870 --> 05:13:10.671
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO

05:13:10.738 --> 05:13:14.108
SHARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

05:13:14.175 --> 05:13:17.578
THANK YOU CENTER CENTER SKINNER.

05:13:17.645 --> 05:13:19.747
THANK YOU.

05:13:19.814 --> 05:13:22.350
SO OUR MATERIALS

05:13:22.416 --> 05:13:26.087
DON'T.

05:13:26.154 --> 05:13:28.189
THE LA TWO MATERIALS IN THE.

05:13:28.256 --> 05:13:29.891
.

05:13:29.957 --> 05:13:31.893
THEIR OVERVIEW.

05:13:31.959 --> 05:13:34.061
DR FIFTH DIFFERENCE FIRST THAT

05:13:34.128 --> 05:13:35.997
THE ASSEMBLY RETIREMENT PLAN

05:13:36.063 --> 05:13:36.931
FUNDING.

05:13:36.998 --> 05:13:38.833
DO YOU SEE.

05:13:38.900 --> 05:13:40.868
BUT THE TIME.

05:13:40.935 --> 05:13:43.337
.

05:13:43.404 --> 05:13:45.540
MATERIALS ON. THE ISSUE EIGHT IN

05:13:45.606 --> 05:13:48.142
OUR BINDER DON'T REFERENCE IT.

05:13:48.209 --> 05:13:50.511
SO THE MIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT THE

05:13:50.578 --> 05:13:53.447
SENATE DID NOT TAKE ACTION.

05:13:53.514 --> 05:13:53.681
ON THE.

05:13:53.748 --> 05:13:55.216
.

05:13:55.283 --> 05:13:55.449
BUT IT.

05:13:55.516 --> 05:13:58.486
.

05:13:58.553 --> 05:13:59.587
ANY FUNDING TOWARDS THEIR

05:13:59.654 --> 05:14:04.692
RETIREMENT.

05:14:04.759 --> 05:14:05.526
SO WE DIDN'T OKAY.

05:14:05.593 --> 05:14:09.697
.

05:14:09.764 --> 05:14:10.965
YOU KNOW I GUESS THAT I SHOULD

05:14:11.032 --> 05:14:12.300
UNDERSTAND THEN THAT THE

05:14:12.366 --> 05:14:13.401
GOVERNOR WAS NOT. HEARD THE

05:14:13.467 --> 05:14:15.503
ADMINISTRATION RATHER WAS NOT.

05:14:15.570 --> 05:14:18.005
RECOMMENDING ANY.

05:14:18.072 --> 05:14:19.340
PROP TWO FUNDING AROUND

05:14:19.407 --> 05:14:21.943
UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY.

05:14:22.009 --> 05:14:23.311
WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THAT

05:14:23.377 --> 05:14:24.879
I THAT WE HAVE A WILL SEE IN THE

05:14:24.946 --> 05:14:27.348
PAST UTILIZED PROP TWO FUNDING

05:14:27.415 --> 05:14:29.116
OF FOR YOU SEE RETIREMENT. AT

05:14:29.183 --> 05:14:30.251
ALSO KNOWN THIS IS KIND OF

05:14:30.318 --> 05:14:32.153
TECHNICAL ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S

05:14:32.220 --> 05:14:34.322
UTILIZING PROP TWO FUNDS IT'LL

05:14:34.388 --> 05:14:36.290
REALLY BE A CONFORMING ACTION

05:14:36.357 --> 05:14:38.092
DRIVEN OFF OF THE FINAL BUDGET

05:14:38.159 --> 05:14:39.994
PACKAGE IN THE REVENUES. THIS IS

05:14:40.061 --> 05:14:42.830
ON THE DEBT SIDE OF PROP TWO AND

05:14:42.897 --> 05:14:44.332
THERE WILL BE A TOTAL DERIVED

05:14:44.398 --> 05:14:45.933
FROM THAT THE REVENUE PACKAGE

05:14:46.000 --> 05:14:47.134
THAT'S ADOPTED.

05:14:47.201 --> 05:14:48.736
SO THERE THERE COULD BE SOME

05:14:48.803 --> 05:14:55.509
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE.

05:14:55.576 --> 05:14:57.011
THAT WOULD JUST DEPEND ON WHAT

05:14:57.078 --> 05:14:58.579
THAT FINAL PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE I

05:14:58.646 --> 05:14:59.847
THINK YOU KNOW IT AS MY

05:14:59.914 --> 05:15:01.649
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED.

05:15:01.716 --> 05:15:02.817
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN OUR

05:15:02.883 --> 05:15:04.452
PROPOSAL WE DID NOT INCLUDE

05:15:04.518 --> 05:15:05.786
FUNDING FOR THAT SO BUT

05:15:05.853 --> 05:15:06.654
CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE

05:15:06.721 --> 05:15:07.955
INCONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN THAT

05:15:08.022 --> 05:15:10.458
WE PUT FORWARD.

05:15:10.524 --> 05:15:11.726
WELL.

05:15:11.792 --> 05:15:15.696
.

05:15:15.763 --> 05:15:17.865
I THE.

05:15:17.932 --> 05:15:21.836
MY MAIN CONCERN IS.

05:15:21.902 --> 05:15:23.070
I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO

05:15:23.137 --> 05:15:24.739
DISCUSS WHETHER WE SHOULD DIRECT

05:15:24.805 --> 05:15:26.440
SOME PROP TWO FUNDING TOWARDS

05:15:26.507 --> 05:15:27.808
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BUT WHAT

05:15:27.875 --> 05:15:29.110
I.

05:15:29.176 --> 05:15:30.845
WOULD I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED

05:15:30.911 --> 05:15:34.582
ABOUT IS UC'S PROPOSAL. TO HAVE

05:15:34.649 --> 05:15:37.051
SOME.

05:15:37.118 --> 05:15:39.053
TO EITHER HAVE A AND NEW POLICY

05:15:39.120 --> 05:15:42.957
YOUR NEW STAFF BEING ABLE TO.

05:15:43.024 --> 05:15:44.492
OPT OUT IN BE IN A FOR A WIND

05:15:44.558 --> 05:15:46.894
CAVE VERSUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

05:15:46.961 --> 05:15:48.729
DEFINED SYSTEM PENSION. AND THE

05:15:48.796 --> 05:15:50.498
REASON I RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE

05:15:50.564 --> 05:15:51.799
AS WE KNOW.

05:15:51.866 --> 05:15:54.235
ALL OF OUR PENSION SYSTEMS.

05:15:54.302 --> 05:15:56.070
OUR BASED ON. THE.

05:15:56.137 --> 05:15:58.406
IT.

05:15:58.472 --> 05:16:01.709
THE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN.

05:16:01.776 --> 05:16:03.978
THAT ARE GONNA THEN PROVIDE OUT

05:16:04.045 --> 05:16:05.646
LONG TERM SECURITY AND AS SOON

05:16:05.713 --> 05:16:08.716
AS WE CREATE A PATHWAY FOR.

05:16:08.783 --> 05:16:11.252
EMPLOYEES NOT TO CONTRIBUTE.

05:16:11.319 --> 05:16:13.321
TOWARDS THAT DEFINED BENEFIT

05:16:13.387 --> 05:16:15.956
SYSTEM. THEN WE CREATE FURTHER

05:16:16.023 --> 05:16:18.426
INSTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM.

05:16:18.492 --> 05:16:20.261
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

05:16:20.328 --> 05:16:23.698
SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO SO.

05:16:23.764 --> 05:16:25.966
THEN I AM NOT SURE WHY I MEAN I

05:16:26.033 --> 05:16:27.535
CAN IMAGINE YOU SEE WANTS TO

05:16:27.601 --> 05:16:29.437
LESSEN THEIR. PENSION

05:16:29.503 --> 05:16:31.872
LIABILITIES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT

05:16:31.939 --> 05:16:33.441
COULD INCREASE IT.

05:16:33.507 --> 05:16:34.442
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE FOLKS

05:16:34.508 --> 05:16:35.343
THAT ARE NOT FINDING INTO THE

05:16:35.409 --> 05:16:37.111
SYSTEM.

05:16:37.178 --> 05:16:37.678
SO I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT

05:16:37.745 --> 05:16:40.414
THAT.

05:16:40.481 --> 05:16:42.750
THANK YOU.

05:16:42.817 --> 05:16:45.619
WE QUICKLY.

05:16:45.686 --> 05:16:49.290
SEN CENTER MITCHELL THE THIRD A

05:16:49.357 --> 05:16:50.191
MORE.

05:16:50.257 --> 05:16:50.791
OKAY I WOULD JUST TO MAKE A

05:16:50.858 --> 05:16:51.359

05:23:32.993 --> 05:23:34.161
YOU KNOW WE HAD WE DO HAVE THREE

05:23:34.228 --> 05:23:35.729
PROPOSALS THAT ARE FAIRLY CLOSE

05:23:35.796 --> 05:23:37.965
TO EACH OTHER. BUT THEY DO HAVE

05:23:38.031 --> 05:23:39.433
SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES AND THAT

05:23:39.500 --> 05:23:40.267
WAS JUST ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES

05:23:40.334 --> 05:23:43.403
THRUST.

05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:45.105
I GUESS I'LL WAIT THEN FURTHER

05:23:45.172 --> 05:23:46.640
HEALTH AGENDA TO GET IT THANK

05:23:46.707 --> 05:23:53.046
YOU VERY MUCH FOR.

05:23:53.113 --> 05:23:54.248
CENTER SKINNER.

05:23:54.314 --> 05:23:56.550
BOB.

05:23:56.617 --> 05:23:57.117
THANK YOU.

05:23:57.184 --> 05:23:59.286
NOW I WANTED TO JUST GET A

05:23:59.353 --> 05:24:01.722
LITTLE MORE INTO THE.

05:24:01.789 --> 05:24:03.257
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO

05:24:03.323 --> 05:24:05.292
ACTIONS ARE HOUSES TO ACTIONS

05:24:05.359 --> 05:24:08.095
REGARDING BOTH OVER IN ROMANCE.

05:24:08.162 --> 05:24:08.262
AND.

05:24:08.328 --> 05:24:12.533
.

05:24:12.599 --> 05:24:15.402
THERE ARE BASE THEY SLOW

05:24:15.469 --> 05:24:16.236
FINDINGS THE SAME.

05:24:16.303 --> 05:24:18.839
.

05:24:18.906 --> 05:24:21.441
ID LIKE THE SENATE'S.

05:24:21.508 --> 05:24:26.814
STRUCTURED IT TRIED. TO MOVE.

05:24:26.880 --> 05:24:29.416
YOU SEE AN TO INCREASING THE

05:24:29.483 --> 05:24:31.618
NUMBER OF IN STATE STUDENTS AND

05:24:31.685 --> 05:24:32.920
I LIKE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED

05:24:32.986 --> 05:24:36.490
BECAUSE IT GIVES TIME SO THAT.

05:24:36.557 --> 05:24:40.327
WE CAN INTERACT AS TO WHAT THE.

05:24:40.394 --> 05:24:42.462
GREEN PARTLY YOU HAS INCREASED

05:24:42.529 --> 05:24:44.398
ITS RELIANCE ON THE OUT OF STATE

05:24:44.464 --> 05:24:45.933
STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY PAY A

05:24:45.999 --> 05:24:49.002
HIGHER. FEE AND AS STATE FUNDING

05:24:49.069 --> 05:24:50.604
WAS CUT BACK.

05:24:50.671 --> 05:24:51.438
IT WAS.

05:24:51.505 --> 05:24:54.274
PARTIALLY A MAKEUP OF THE CUT

05:24:54.341 --> 05:24:56.510
BACK IN STATE FUNDING. WE ARE

05:24:56.577 --> 05:24:58.645
DOING BETTER IN TERMS OF WHAT

05:24:58.712 --> 05:25:00.480
WE'RE PROVIDING BUT I LIKE THE

05:25:00.547 --> 05:25:02.783
APPROACH OF THE SENATE'S BECAUSE

05:25:02.850 --> 05:25:04.418
IT. GIVES THE ABILITY.

05:25:04.484 --> 05:25:07.287
OVER TIME TO FIGURE OUT VERY.

05:25:07.354 --> 05:25:08.622
HOW WE BOTH SHARE THAT

05:25:08.689 --> 05:25:10.123
RESPONSIBILITY TO INCREASE THE

05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:11.458
NUMBER OF?

05:25:11.525 --> 05:25:14.494
IN STATE STUDENTS.

05:25:14.561 --> 05:25:18.198
BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT. OUR.

05:25:18.265 --> 05:25:19.733
WE'RE PROVIDING THE SENATE

05:25:19.800 --> 05:25:21.335
ACTION IS PROVIDING.

05:25:21.401 --> 05:25:23.170
TWENTY FIVE MILLION.

05:25:23.237 --> 05:25:24.504
TO DEAL WITH THE OVER ENROLLMENT

05:25:24.571 --> 05:25:26.206
RIGHT NOW.

05:25:26.273 --> 05:25:29.176
AND THE ASSEMBLY WENT TO HAVE

05:25:29.243 --> 05:25:31.044
LESS THAN THAT.

05:25:31.111 --> 05:25:33.213
BUT THEN THE ASSEMBLY WENT FOUR.

05:25:33.280 --> 05:25:35.249
TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR NEXT

05:25:35.315 --> 05:25:37.618
YEAR. WHICH MIGHT BE OVER

05:25:37.684 --> 05:25:38.986
ENROLLMENT AND WE WENT.

05:25:39.052 --> 05:25:41.255
FOR WHAT IT SIMPLY SAID TWENTY

05:25:41.321 --> 05:25:43.290
FIVE MILLION ARE NOT QUITE SURE

05:25:43.357 --> 05:25:45.425
HOW AT THESE THINGS UP. I'M NOT

05:25:45.492 --> 05:25:46.793
CRITICIZING ASSEMBLY LOOK ONLY

05:25:46.860 --> 05:25:48.762
BUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR

05:25:48.829 --> 05:25:49.529
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE

05:25:49.596 --> 05:25:51.398
STUDENTS AND THEN SENATE ACTION

05:25:51.465 --> 05:25:53.967
IS FIVE MILLION FOR FIVE HUNDRED.

05:25:54.034 --> 05:25:56.336
MORE STUDENTS WHICH.

05:25:56.403 --> 05:26:00.440
ISN'T A.

05:26:00.507 --> 05:26:02.409
RIGHT NOW I GET IT THEY JUST DID

05:26:02.476 --> 05:26:04.745
IT ON OKAY BUT ANYWAY SO WERE

05:26:04.811 --> 05:26:06.380
WERE SUPPORTING FEWER IN THE

05:26:06.446 --> 05:26:08.115
ASSEMBLY WOULD RECOMMEND MORE

05:26:08.181 --> 05:26:10.017
BUT WE'RE GIVING MORE.

05:26:10.083 --> 05:26:12.152
IN IN THIS YEAR SO.

05:26:12.219 --> 05:26:14.121
SOMEBODY JUST

05:26:14.187 --> 05:26:15.856
SCRIBE WHAT THE NOT THE

05:26:15.923 --> 05:26:17.190
DIFFERENCE THAT'S OBVIOUS BUT

05:26:17.257 --> 05:26:18.091
WHAT THE.

05:26:18.158 --> 05:26:19.393
MOTIVATION OF THE DIFFERENT

05:26:19.459 --> 05:26:23.497
APPROACHES.

05:26:23.563 --> 05:26:24.131
WHAT IF I COULD TALK ABOUT THE

05:26:24.197 --> 05:26:25.365
MOTIVATION OF OUR OF OUR

05:26:25.432 --> 05:26:26.300
APPROACH AND AND WE?

05:26:26.366 --> 05:26:28.035
?

05:26:28.101 --> 05:26:28.368
WERE ABLE TO.

05:26:28.435 --> 05:26:30.437
.

05:26:30.504 --> 05:26:33.507
TALK TO YOU SEE AND.

05:26:33.573 --> 05:26:36.376
THEY WERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT OUR

05:26:36.443 --> 05:26:37.678
PUT NOTHING THAT THEY WERE

05:26:37.744 --> 05:26:38.578
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR APPROACH BUT

05:26:38.645 --> 05:26:39.713
THEY. WERE OKAY WITH OUR

05:26:39.780 --> 05:26:40.314
APPROACH.

05:26:40.380 --> 05:26:42.316
.

05:26:42.382 --> 05:26:43.317
BAY.

05:26:43.383 --> 05:26:45.585
OR ABLE TO WE HAVE TO COME TO

05:26:45.652 --> 05:26:46.920
AGREEMENT REGARDING THE TWELVE

05:26:46.987 --> 05:26:48.655
AND A HALF. MILLION FOR THE OLD

05:26:48.722 --> 05:26:50.190
FIRM ROLE MEANT IN THIS CURRENT

05:26:50.257 --> 05:26:53.493
YEAR WHERE WE WOULD PAY HAD TOLD

05:26:53.560 --> 05:26:55.195
AND HALF MILLION IT AND THEY

05:26:55.262 --> 05:26:56.163
WOULD COME UP WITH THE TOP HALF

05:26:56.229 --> 05:26:59.132
MILLION THROUGH. THROUGH THEIR

05:26:59.199 --> 05:27:00.734
UNIVERSITY EFFICIENCIES.

05:27:00.801 --> 05:27:02.235
SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

05:27:02.302 --> 05:27:03.437
OUR ACTION OF TWENTY FIVE TO

05:27:03.503 --> 05:27:05.739
TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS THE NEED.

05:27:05.806 --> 05:27:08.241
BUT THE ASSEMBLY.

05:27:08.308 --> 05:27:09.643
I TOOK THE PRAYER THEY PREFERRED

05:27:09.710 --> 05:27:11.511
TO GO WITH.

05:27:11.578 --> 05:27:12.512
THEY WOULD OFFER TWELVE POINT

05:27:12.579 --> 05:27:13.680
FIVE IF YOU SEE WOULD HAVE

05:27:13.747 --> 05:27:15.415
BECOME OF THE OTHER CRACK WE WE

05:27:15.482 --> 05:27:16.883
AND YOURS YEARS PAST THAT HAS

05:27:16.950 --> 05:27:18.418
BEEN AN APPROACH THAT WE'VE

05:27:18.485 --> 05:27:19.953
ADOPTED IN BUDGET WHERE.

05:27:20.020 --> 05:27:21.521
WE'VE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND

05:27:21.588 --> 05:27:22.923
THEN WE ENDED UP PAYING FOR FIVE

05:27:22.990 --> 05:27:24.358
THOUSAND STUDENTS UNDER

05:27:24.424 --> 05:27:25.459
OBVIOUSLY.

05:27:25.525 --> 05:27:27.194
OUR APPROACH WAS DIFFERENT GOING

05:27:27.260 --> 05:27:28.962
INTO OUT YEARS.

05:27:29.029 --> 05:27:30.964
WHERE IT WAS WHERE WE BOTH?

05:27:31.031 --> 05:27:32.666
BOTH HOUSES.

05:27:32.733 --> 05:27:35.335
USE THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

05:27:35.402 --> 05:27:37.070
STUDENT NUMBER WHICH IS

05:27:37.137 --> 05:27:37.938
HOW DO YOU GET THE FIVE MILLION

05:27:38.005 --> 05:27:39.072
FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND THE TWENTY

05:27:39.139 --> 05:27:47.881
FIVE MILLION FOR.

05:27:47.948 --> 05:27:48.348
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED.

05:27:48.415 --> 05:27:48.548
OKAY.

05:27:48.615 --> 05:27:48.815
BUT THEN.

05:27:48.882 --> 05:27:50.317
.

05:27:50.384 --> 05:27:53.353
SENATE OPTED TO GO WITH LESS.

05:27:53.420 --> 05:27:55.055
STUDENTS

05:27:55.122 --> 05:27:56.623
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BURNED

05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:57.524
NINETEEN TWENTY.

05:27:57.591 --> 05:27:58.859
.

05:27:58.925 --> 05:28:00.927
YEAH.

05:28:00.994 --> 05:28:02.829
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT

05:28:02.896 --> 05:28:04.765
CLOSING THIS TODAY. BUT.

05:28:04.831 --> 05:28:06.366
THERE MIGHT BE.

05:28:06.433 --> 05:28:07.834
SOME KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND HERE

05:28:07.901 --> 05:28:08.035
WHERE.

05:28:08.101 --> 05:28:12.773
.

05:28:12.839 --> 05:28:13.273
IF.

05:28:13.340 --> 05:28:16.476
IF IN FACT YOU SEE CAN COVER.

05:28:16.543 --> 05:28:18.745
PORTION OF THE OVER ENROLLMENT

05:28:18.812 --> 05:28:19.980
FROM THIS YEAR.

05:28:20.047 --> 05:28:22.849
THEN.

05:28:22.916 --> 05:28:24.084
AND I KNOW AND. THE

05:28:24.151 --> 05:28:25.986
ADMINISTRATION WILL LOOK AT THIS

05:28:26.053 --> 05:28:27.054
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT

05:28:27.120 --> 05:28:28.755
THAT THEY WERE OFFERING UP ANY

05:28:28.822 --> 05:28:30.824
OF THIS GENERAL FUND TO BUT AT

05:28:30.891 --> 05:28:32.492
LEAST FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. WE

05:28:32.559 --> 05:28:34.027
WOULD GET CLOSER TO THE SAME

05:28:34.094 --> 05:28:36.897
TYPE OF GENERAL FUND IF WE.

05:28:36.963 --> 05:28:38.665
IF WE WENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY

05:28:38.732 --> 05:28:40.500
SURPRISED JOHN THE CURRENT YEAR

05:28:40.567 --> 05:28:42.436
OVER ENROLLMENT AND.

05:28:42.502 --> 05:28:44.838
THEN THE ASSEMBLY SUPERCHUNK THE

05:28:44.905 --> 05:28:46.840
FOLLOWING YEAR IT GETS IT CLOSER

05:28:46.907 --> 05:28:48.809
TO THE SAME. ALEXANDER MITCHELL

05:28:48.875 --> 05:28:50.077
HI I WAS JUST GONNA PROVIDE

05:28:50.143 --> 05:28:51.445
CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE SENATE IT

05:28:51.511 --> 05:28:53.847
WILL YOU KNOW YOU YOU SEE ASK

05:28:53.914 --> 05:28:55.048
FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION

05:28:55.115 --> 05:28:56.149
GENERAL FUND YET ONLY LONG. SO

05:28:56.216 --> 05:28:58.518
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE

05:28:58.585 --> 05:28:59.019
THEIR NEED RIGHT RIGHT.

05:28:59.086 --> 05:28:59.219
RIGHT

05:28:59.286 --> 05:29:00.854
EXACTLY

05:29:00.921 --> 05:29:02.389
SO THAT IT WILL IT WILL DISTANCE

05:29:02.456 --> 05:29:03.757
AT THIS POINT MY PERSPECTIVE OF

05:29:03.824 --> 05:29:04.825
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN

05:29:04.891 --> 05:29:06.326
TERMS OF.

05:29:06.393 --> 05:29:08.028
.

05:29:08.095 --> 05:29:09.763
A AFFORDABILITY IN WHETHER IT'S

05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:11.231
REASONABLE TO EXPECT.

05:29:11.298 --> 05:29:13.033
THAT THEY COME UP WITH THE

05:29:13.100 --> 05:29:15.235
TWELVE POINT FIVE IN. AS MY

05:29:15.302 --> 05:29:23.310
COLLEAGUE SAYS EFFICIENCY.

05:29:23.376 --> 05:29:23.910
WELL I THINK I'VE MENTIONED WE

05:29:23.977 --> 05:29:24.544
WE HAD TO

05:29:24.611 --> 05:29:26.213
BEFORE IT CLOSED WE HAD HAD DONE.

05:29:26.279 --> 05:29:27.781
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU SEE IN

05:29:27.848 --> 05:29:29.716
THERE THEY HAD AGREED TO IT SO

05:29:29.783 --> 05:29:33.520
IT WASN'T IT WASN'T DONE.

05:29:33.587 --> 05:29:35.055
FORM KNOW SOMEONE SAY THAT. BUT

05:29:35.122 --> 05:29:37.090

PROPOSAL ARE VERY CLOSE NOW

05:29:46.466 --> 05:29:49.402
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AND WE HAVE YOU

05:29:49.469 --> 05:29:51.571
KNOW. FAIRLY FAR PARTRELATIVE

05:29:51.638 --> 05:29:53.573
TO THIS PROPOSAL NOT IN TERMS OF

05:29:53.640 --> 05:29:55.642
THE BUDGET OVERALL BUDGET BUT.

05:29:55.709 --> 05:29:56.176
NO TO THIS PUZZLE BUT THE

05:29:56.243 --> 05:30:00.147
ADMINISTRATION SO WE WE. WE HAD

05:30:00.213 --> 05:30:02.682
IS IS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. ALMOST

05:30:02.749 --> 05:30:03.250
IDENTICAL IN TERMS OF THEIR

05:30:03.316 --> 05:30:04.551
PROPOSAL.

05:30:04.618 --> 05:30:05.719
WHAT TIME?

05:30:05.785 --> 05:30:07.320
TO CLARIFY. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

05:30:07.387 --> 05:30:08.321
SURE THAT THE OVER ENROLLMENT

05:30:08.388 --> 05:30:10.023
COSTS ARE COVERED.

05:30:10.090 --> 05:30:11.458
HOWEVER WE DO IT AND I WOULD

05:30:11.525 --> 05:30:12.592
ALSO LIKE TO HAVE MORE

05:30:12.659 --> 05:30:15.362
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS NEXT YEAR.

05:30:16.730 --> 05:30:19.032
.

05:30:19.099 --> 05:30:22.602
BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR MOST FROM

05:30:22.669 --> 05:30:24.437
FOLKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE.

05:30:24.504 --> 05:30:26.940
IS THE FEELING THAT
