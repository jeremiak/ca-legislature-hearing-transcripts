THE COMMISSION CAME UP WITH.

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:16.581 region:rollup2
THREE CAUSES FOR THOSE RIGHTS.

00:45:14.245 --> 00:45:19.116 region:rollup2
ONE WAS RAMPANT RACISM THE OTHER

00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:20.985 region:rollup2
ONE WAS HOUSING OF SEGREGATION

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:21.819 region:rollup2

FACT.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.344 region:rollup2
THE WEALTH GAP IN THIS COUNTRY

00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:04.428 region:rollup2
CLASS THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:07.231 region:rollup2
SEEN.

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:09.734 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:11.802 region:rollup2
AND MORTGAGES FOR QUITE FAMILIES

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:15.206 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IT LEFT MINORITY

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:16.240 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BEHIND ON IT.

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:19.143 region:rollup2
MINORITY COMMUNITIES NINETEEN

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:21.412 region:rollup2
SEVENTY STARTED CATCHING UP.

BECAUSE OF THE FAIR.

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:22.880 region:rollup2
LET.

.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.051 region:rollup2
FAIR LAWS AROUND NOW EQUAL ON

00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:29.287 region:rollup2
THEM PREDICT ACT ON AND AS WE

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:31.088 region:rollup2
STARTED CLOSING THAT GAP MONEY.

00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:34.558 region:rollup2
THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP.

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:36.193 region:rollup2
ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE GREAT HOOK.

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:38.329 region:rollup2
THE CALL NOW THE RECESSION CAME

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:40.131 region:rollup2

BLACK AND LATINOS LOST.

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:45.469 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS OF WEALTH AND JUST

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.171 region:rollup2
THREE.

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:50.007 region:rollup2
WE WERE BACK TO WHERE WE WHERE.

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:52.343 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER THE ALL OF THE RED

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:54.679 region:rollup2
LINE UNIT TAKEN PLACE WHEN.

00:46:52.343 --> 00:46:56.947 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY.

00:46:54.679 --> 00:46:59.650 region:rollup2
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THE MAJOR

00:46:56.947 --> 00:47:01.852 region:rollup2
EDITORIAL CAME OUT AND STATED.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.888 region:rollup2

00:47:11.062 --> 00:47:15.666 region:rollup2
THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:17.702 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE STATE IS.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.402 region:rollup2
THE MISUSE OF SEQUEL SEQUEL IS

00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:20.271 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE GREATEST.

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:23.341 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT WERE PASSED IN

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:24.108 region:rollup2
THE STATE BUT IT'S BEEN MISUSED

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.943 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S TWO LOOPHOLES.

00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:26.911 region:rollup2
ONE IS YOU CAN FILE ANONYMOUSLY

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:28.946 region:rollup2

THE SECOND IS YOU CAN FILE A

LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT DELAY

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:38.322 region:rollup2

DEVELOPMENTS HONEY.

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:42.059 region:rollup2

RECOGNIZED AND HOMEOWNERSHIP IS

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.617 region:rollup2
THE BEST WAY TO BUILD UP

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.085 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THEM

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:09.887 region:rollup2

TO THIS BILL TODAY OUT WE AGREE

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:28.866 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS

00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.601 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT THAT SEEK

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:32.303 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE STANDALONE BECAUSE

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:34.305 region:rollup2
OF THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE NOW.

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:36.073 region:rollup2
.

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:38.209 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T SEEN DATA OUT THERE

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:39.710 region:rollup2
TO POINT DEFINITIVELY THAT IT IS

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:41.612 region:rollup2
JUST SEQUENCE EQUAL LOAN THAT IS

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.180 region:rollup2
CAUSING. THE PRICES OF HOUSING

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:44.448 region:rollup2
TO SOAR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.783 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS FACTORS IN THAT AND

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:47.518 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE DATA

00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:50.688 region:rollup2
ON LITIGATION RATES.

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:52.957 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON THE

00:49:50.688 --> 00:49:54.291 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF THE. TOTAL CASES FILED

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:56.327 region:rollup2
OR OR HOW THOSE RESULT SO

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:58.395 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT DATA IS IT'S REALLY

00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:58.696 region:rollup2
HARD TO JUST SAY THAT THIS IS

00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:59.630 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM.

00:49:58.696 --> 00:50:00.297 region:rollup2
.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.098 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.800 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH.

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:05.202 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSALS IN THIS BILL.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.404 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION ARE

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:09.340 region:rollup2
BY LIMITING INJUNCTIONS ON CASES

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:11.242 region:rollup2
ARE YOU THERE CAN BE SOMEWHAT

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:13.344 region:rollup2
PERVERSE OUTCOMES. UP FOR

00:50:11.242 --> 00:50:14.211 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN THAT WERE

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.614 region:rollup2
INJUNCTIONS WERE NOT SOCCER

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:17.648 region:rollup2
GRANTED IN PROJECTS THAT. THE

00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:19.116 region:rollup2
COURTS CAN ACTUALLY ORDER

00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:20.217 region:rollup2
DEMOLITION IF THEY DON'T COMPLY

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.086 region:rollup2
WITH THE LAW.

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:23.721 region:rollup2
IF SUBSEQUENTLY I OURS ARE

00:50:22.086 --> 00:50:25.222 region:rollup2
REQUIRED I'M I THINK IT DOES PUT

00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:27.658 region:rollup2
A LOT OF UNDUE PRESSURE ON LEAD

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:29.326 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ANALYZING THESE CASES.

00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:32.229 region:rollup2
TO BUT NOT GO AHEAD WITH WITH

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:33.697 region:rollup2
ANY ANY CHANGES TO THE PROJECT

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.465 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY BUILT

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:50:34.465 --> 00:50:38.235 region:rollup2
AND THIS COULD LEAD TO

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.869 region:rollup2
UNINTENTIONAL IMPACTS IN

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.036 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT GO ON MEDICAID

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:39.737 region:rollup2
IT.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.537 region:rollup2
.

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:42.339 region:rollup2
I'LL THERE ARE ALREADY

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:43.607 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO MEET

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:44.375 region:rollup2
INJUNCTIONS AND WE THINK IT WAS

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:46.043 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT UP FOR SEQUEL

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:48.245 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:50.281 region:rollup2
AND SO WE JUST DON'T THINK THIS

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:51.148 region:rollup2
OUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL WILL

00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:53.217 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THAN

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:57.788 region:rollup2
WHAT SIX TO SOFTEN SO WHAT WE

00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:59.089 region:rollup2
ARE CHEN ABOUT.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:01.125 region:rollup2
TURN MEMBERS TAMPON FOR THE

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:02.626 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE JEWISH

00:51:01.125 --> 00:51:05.396 region:rollup2
COUNCIL IS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:07.097 region:rollup2
FOR REASONS A SIMILAR TO THAT

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:08.399 region:rollup2
THIRTY. OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:10.601 region:rollup2
BEEN PENDING OVER.

00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:11.702 region:rollup2
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:12.970 region:rollup2
A BIT OF GOOD BEEN DESIGNED TO

EITHER EXPEDITE.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:16.173 region:rollup2
SEVERELY EXPEDITE THE JUDICIAL

REVIEW TIME LINES ARE PROVIDE

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:18.609 region:rollup2
THE SAME KIND THE LIMITS ON

00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:20.344 region:rollup2
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:22.580 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR OUR OPPOSITION IS

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:23.914 region:rollup2
NOT BASED ON ANY POSITIONS ON

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.683 region:rollup2
SEQUEL OR THE MERITS OF THE

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:26.183 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR HOUSING PROJECTS THAT

00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:28.319 region:rollup2
WOULD BE COVERED BY THIS

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:29.920 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION. THOSE ARE POLICY

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:32.489 region:rollup2
ISSUES OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW OUR

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.591 region:rollup2
SOLE FOCUS OR IS ON WHAT THE

IMPACTS LEGISLATION LIKE THIS.

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:38.629 region:rollup2
NOT RESULT IN

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:40.064 region:rollup2
THE COURTS HAVE BROAD EQUITABLE

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:41.465 region:rollup2
POWERS IN EVERY CASE INCLUDING

00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:43.467 region:rollup2
SECRET MATTERS.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:44.868 region:rollup2
A FASHION AN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:46.437 region:rollup2
WHEN VIOLATIONS OF BEEN FOUND

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:48.672 region:rollup2

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.276 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.844 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS WE THINK ARE

NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR FOLKS TO

A HIGHER. BURDEN.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:37.233 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THINK THAT INSURANCE

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.868 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED CURRENTLY

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:41.404 region:rollup2

.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:50.880 region:rollup2

ONLY THE AMOUNT NEEDED TOWER

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:52.942 region:rollup2

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.880 region:rollup2

FEE AND FOR FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.952 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:04.653 region:rollup2
THAT OUR CURRENT TIRE RECYCLING

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:06.122 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS NOT GENERATING THE

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:07.289 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT WE NEED.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:09.291 region:rollup2

RECYCLING INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.827 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:14.029 region:rollup2
POLLUTION AND ILLEGAL DUMPING

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:15.698 region:rollup2
WHILE ALSO CREATING NEW JOBS AND

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.099 region:rollup2
STIMULATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:18.734 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. AND I

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:20.136 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE

GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:34.517 region:rollup2
WASTE.

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:36.485 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:37.219 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.721 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE IS SEEN IN

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:40.122 region:rollup2
ADVANCE TO THE SAME PROPOSAL

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME ON THIS

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.591 region:rollup2
BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE AND WE

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:42.791 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT IN THE

THE.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:47.062 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE LAST YEAR THE

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE IN THE RECOVERY

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:50.232 region:rollup2
RATE FOR TIRES CONTINUES TO MOVE

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.467 region:rollup2
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:53.569 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING A

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:55.437 region:rollup2
GREAT DEAL OF MONEY MOVING TIRES

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:58.107 region:rollup2
AROUND BUT THOSE TIRES ARE NOT

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:59.575 region:rollup2
GETTING RECYCLED. THIS IS THIS

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.943 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.812 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THE PARADIGM WITH

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.414 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE TIRE RECYCLING

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.782 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO THAT INSTEAD OF

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:09.084 region:rollup2
FOCUSING THE DOLLARS ALL AT THE

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:09.952 region:rollup2
BACKEND WHERE CONSUMERS ARE

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.320 region:rollup2
CHARGE FOR THE DISPOSAL THE

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:13.522 region:rollup2
TIRES. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THE

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.157 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES AT THE END USE THAT

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.825 region:rollup2
WE DESIRE AT THE NINETY PERCENT

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:18.027 region:rollup2
RECYCLING AND USE THAT IS IN THE

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:19.395 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:21.397 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:22.998 region:rollup2
EXISTING RECYCLING INCENTIVES

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:24.667 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE HAVE FOR ELECTRONIC

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:26.502 region:rollup2
WASTE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.703 region:rollup2
AND OTHER MATERIALS WE KNOW HOW

01:18:26.502 --> 01:18:30.272 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS WE KNOW HOW TO GET

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:33.576 region:rollup2
THESE TIRES RECYCLED AND TO.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:34.810 region:rollup2
THE THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE.

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:36.645 region:rollup2
AND THAT HIGHEST AND BEST USE

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:38.581 region:rollup2
ISN'T JUST UP APPROPRIATE IN

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:39.648 region:rollup2
TERMS OF RECOVERING THOSE TIRES

01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:41.450 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:43.018 region:rollup2
HAVE ILLEGALLY DUMPED TIRES WE

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.652 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TIRES GOING TO LAND

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:45.154 region:rollup2
FULLER WE DON'T HAVE TIRES BEING

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:46.055 region:rollup2
BURNED.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:47.489 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE UTILIZE

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:50.092 region:rollup2
THOSE TIRES AS RIVER PAVING

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:51.994 region:rollup2
MATERIALS IT MAKES FOR BETTER.

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:53.295 region:rollup2
LONGER LASTING ROADS THAT ARE

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:54.330 region:rollup2
QUIETER ON AND THAT ULTIMATELY

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.598 region:rollup2
SAVE.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.932 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MONEY

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:58.968 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A THIS IS ONE OF

01:18:56.932 --> 01:19:00.803 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.238 region:rollup2
HAVE AN IN USE WE JUST GOT TO

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:03.038 region:rollup2
CONNECT THE DOTS LIKE PUTTING

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.374 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVES IN THE RIGHT

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:06.308 region:rollup2
PLACE. RATHER THAN HAVING ALL

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:08.077 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVE AT THE BACK AND TO

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:10.212 region:rollup2
JUST GO TO THE CHEAPEST DISPOSAL

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:14.183 region:rollup2
WERE BURNED FOR EXPORT. THE

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:14.850 region:rollup2
URGENT AYE VOTE.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:15.684 region:rollup2
JEFF SERIES ON HALF OF THE U. S.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.685 region:rollup2
TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.387 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT.

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.655 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORK ON THIS ISSUE

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.856 region:rollup2
AND HAD DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.424 region:rollup2
THE PAST SEVERAL VERSIONS BUT TO

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:24.827 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH CAO

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.928 region:rollup2
RECYCLE.

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:28.197 region:rollup2
JESSICA AND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:29.265 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT OF THEM I THINK

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.065 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY WAS A LOT OF CONCERNS

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS PARASITE ALREADY

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:32.635 region:rollup2
HAD AN ENORMOUS SURPLUS AND THAT

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.070 region:rollup2
WAS ONE OF THINGS WE ASK FOR WAS

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:35.904 region:rollup2
LET'S SPEND DOWN. ALL THE MONEY

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.872 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU ALLOWED CHARGING A

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.673 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE AGREED TO THAT. WE

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.240 region:rollup2
ALSO AGREE WITH WHAT THE MARK

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:39.508 region:rollup2
MURRAY JUST SAID WHICH IS

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.643 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE HIGHEST AND BEST

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:42.177 region:rollup2
USE IS PUTTING THIS ON OUR ROADS

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:42.878 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY THERE'S LANGUAGE IN

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:46.081 region:rollup2
THERE THAT CAO RECYCLED SEPASANG

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:47.816 region:rollup2
BUT AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT HAS

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:49.151 region:rollup2
TO GO TO THE ROOTS. NOW WE HAVE

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:52.121 region:rollup2
S. B. ONE FUNDING HOPEFULLY WILL

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:53.188 region:rollup2
START BUILDING MORE ROADS IN

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM.

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:54.757 region:rollup2
SO YEAH WE APPRECIATE WORKING

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.958 region:rollup2
WITH THEM.

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:57.993 region:rollup2
THE BILL MAY OR MAY NOT BE

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.228 region:rollup2
PERFECT BUT IT'S UNCERTAIN MOST

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:03.098 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:03.732 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE OUR SPORT.

IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE OF THE

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:22.350 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT THIS WILL TAKE

.

01:35:23.585 --> 01:35:25.987 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE OF THE VERACITY OF

01:35:24.519 --> 01:35:28.723 region:rollup2

IN MOST BUILDINGS.

02:00:19.546 --> 02:00:21.481 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A RANGE

02:00:42.502 --> 02:00:44.838 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE IS THAT THESE EMISSIONS

02:00:43.703 --> 02:00:45.839 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS.

02:00:44.838 --> 02:00:46.539 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CONSIDER EVERYTHING

02:00:45.839 --> 02:00:47.307 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:50.176 region:rollup2
WOULD BENEFIT THE BUILDING

02:00:47.307 --> 02:00:52.345 region:rollup2
SECTOR FROM EFFICIENCY CAN

02:00:50.176 --> 02:00:52.912 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY STORY FOR NOBLE GAS.

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:54.314 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION BY

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:56.616 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTIES VERY REASONABLE

02:00:54.314 --> 02:00:57.183 region:rollup2
THE MEN GAP IS THE EMISSIONS

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.917 region:rollup2
FROM SPACE HEATING AND WATER

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:59.452 region:rollup2
HEATING.

02:00:57.917 --> 02:01:00.420 region:rollup2
GOAL SETTING HAS A PROVEN TRACK

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:02.589 region:rollup2
RECORD FOR CUNANAN JIM

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:03.957 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHEN THE STATE SET

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:04.757 region:rollup2
IT'S FIFTY PERCENT RENEWABLE

02:01:03.957 --> 02:01:05.859 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY GOAL IS SEEMED

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:07.360 region:rollup2
AMBITIOUS.

02:01:05.859 --> 02:01:09.262 region:rollup2
BUT JUST A FEW YEARS LATER WE ON

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.864 region:rollup2
TRACK TO ACHIEVING IT TEN YEARS

02:01:09.262 --> 02:01:12.065 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

02:01:10.864 --> 02:01:13.466 region:rollup2
SO INDUSTRY NOW PROVIDES MORE

02:01:12.065 --> 02:01:15.201 region:rollup2
THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOB IN

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:17.537 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO THE COSTS HAVE

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:19.172 region:rollup2
COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY THIS IS

02:01:17.537 --> 02:01:20.540 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE OPTIONS YOU WHEN YOU

02:01:19.172 --> 02:01:21.241 region:rollup2
CHEN LOCK FOR CLEAN HEATING AND

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:21.808 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS.

02:01:21.241 --> 02:01:23.910 region:rollup2
LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR

02:01:21.808 --> 02:01:24.978 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ARGUMENTS.

02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:26.312 region:rollup2
FIRST OF THIS IN THE NEXT

02:01:24.978 --> 02:01:27.981 region:rollup2
RESTRICT EQUIVOCATION MANDATE.

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:29.082 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY FACTS

02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:30.383 region:rollup2
AND BY THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

02:01:29.082 --> 02:01:32.118 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:33.553 region:rollup2
FAVORS ELECTRIFICATION. THE

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:35.155 region:rollup2
BILL'S TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND

02:01:33.553 --> 02:01:36.389 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE BASED

02:01:35.155 --> 02:01:38.291 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE GAS CAN COMPETE WITH

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:39.726 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION ON ITS MERITS

02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:41.461 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOESN'T PICK A WINNER

02:01:39.726 --> 02:01:43.196 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE WILL NEED AND ALL OF

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:44.964 region:rollup2
THE ABOVE STRATEGY.

02:01:43.196 --> 02:01:45.965 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CLAIM IS THAT THIS BILL

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:48.802 region:rollup2
WOULD REDUCE QUICK CUSTOMER

02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:49.869 region:rollup2
CHOICE THIS IS IRONIC.

02:01:48.802 --> 02:01:51.471 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS DON'T COME WE HAVE A

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:53.339 region:rollup2
REAL CHOICE WILL CLEANER AND

02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:55.241 region:rollup2
MORE AFFORDABLE HEATING OPTIONS.

02:01:53.339 --> 02:01:56.743 region:rollup2
GAS IS USING EIGHTY PERCENT OF

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:59.879 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUILDINGS IT'S A DE

02:01:56.743 --> 02:02:00.513 region:rollup2
FACTO MONOPOLY SITUATION.

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.848 region:rollup2
AND THE MARKET FOR KEY NO TURN

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:03.816 region:rollup2
DAVIS IS UNDER DEVELOPED.

02:02:01.848 --> 02:02:05.585 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD SPUR INVESTMENT

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:06.486 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND MAKE IT

02:02:05.585 --> 02:02:08.454 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE.

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:10.056 region:rollup2
LAST

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:11.391 region:rollup2
WE HEAR CLAIMS THAT CLEAN

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:14.627 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC HEATING WOULD INCREASED

02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:16.196 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER BILLS.

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:18.665 region:rollup2
BIG DATA OUTDATED PERCEPTION

02:02:16.196 --> 02:02:20.033 region:rollup2
THAT ELECTRIC HEATING IS MORE

02:02:18.665 --> 02:02:21.401 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAN GAS HEATING.

02:02:20.033 --> 02:02:22.502 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE

02:02:21.401 --> 02:02:25.271 region:rollup2
THIS WHAT THE CASE ONE VICTORY

02:02:22.502 --> 02:02:26.706 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE HEATING WAS USED NOW

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.174 region:rollup2
WITH MODERN ELECTRIC HEATING

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:30.109 region:rollup2
BASE AND HE PUMP TECHNOLOGY.

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:31.211 region:rollup2
WHICH IS FIVE TO SIX TIMES AS

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:33.379 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AT BEST COMPRESSION

02:02:31.211 --> 02:02:34.981 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:36.049 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC HEATING IS ACTUALLY AN

02:02:34.981 --> 02:02:37.383 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE CUSTOM

02:02:36.049 --> 02:02:38.518 region:rollup2
BILLS

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:39.886 region:rollup2
THAT IS CURRENTLY ONLY

02:02:38.518 --> 02:02:41.120 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE TO WESTERN

02:02:39.886 --> 02:02:42.021 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND THIS BILL WOULD

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.556 region:rollup2
MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:46.125 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:47.193 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING TO WRAP.

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:48.661 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY FIFTH THIRTY TO THIRTY

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:50.163 region:rollup2
TWO WOULD CUT CALIFORNIA WOULD

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:51.264 region:rollup2
PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO

02:02:50.163 --> 02:02:53.032 region:rollup2
CLEANER HEALTHIER AND MORE

02:02:51.264 --> 02:02:53.399 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE BUILDINGS. WE

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:57.937 region:rollup2
HONESTLY I FELT

AT ACHIEVING MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN

02:03:21.661 --> 02:03:24.631 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS THAT

02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:26.1000 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GLOBAL

02:03:24.631 --> 02:03:29.469 region:rollup2

CONTINUED USE OF SUCH ENERGY

02:03:33.907 --> 02:03:36.409 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:38.144 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE BUILDING SECTOR

02:03:36.409 --> 02:03:40.280 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTES ABOUT A QUARTER OF

02:03:38.144 --> 02:03:41.414 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S CLIMATE EMISSIONS.

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.149 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE VOTING A

02:03:41.414 --> 02:03:44.884 region:rollup2
CONCRETE PLAN TO THE CARBON EYES

02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:46.252 region:rollup2
ARE BUILDING SECTORS AS

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:48.755 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED BY A. B. THIRTY TO

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:50.590 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO. IS VERY SOUND PUBLIC

02:03:48.755 --> 02:03:52.158 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THROUGH SUCH A PLAN

02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:53.593 region:rollup2
WE COULD ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT

02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:55.228 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS OF

02:03:53.593 --> 02:03:56.462 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS THAT CONTRIBUTES

02:03:55.228 --> 02:03:57.430 region:rollup2
BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:59.232 region:rollup2

IMPACT PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.504 region:rollup2
MOST CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES

02:04:03.336 --> 02:04:05.805 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT MODERN

02:04:04.504 --> 02:04:07.707 region:rollup2
ELECTROCUTING COULD POTENTIALLY

02:04:05.805 --> 02:04:08.608 region:rollup2
CUT CO TWO EMISSIONS AND HALF

02:04:07.707 --> 02:04:10.376 region:rollup2
COMPARE WITH THE BEST GAS

02:04:08.608 --> 02:04:12.045 region:rollup2
COMBUSTION. HEATING SYSTEMS AND

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:13.680 region:rollup2
IT EMISSIONS CAN DROP EVEN

02:04:12.045 --> 02:04:14.180 region:rollup2
FURTHER AS OUR GRID CONTINUE

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.049 region:rollup2
SICK.

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.684 region:rollup2
GET CLEANER WE BELIEVE THAT A

02:04:16.049 --> 02:04:19.452 region:rollup2
CONCERTED EFFORT TO LECTURE FIRE

02:04:17.684 --> 02:04:21.187 region:rollup2

REDUCE THE EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:39.038 region:rollup2
FUELS.

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:41.007 region:rollup2
WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT IS A VERY

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:42.642 region:rollup2

WE'RE DOING THAT BY ELIMINATING

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:32.558 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND BUILDINGS?

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:35.228 region:rollup2
OUR BUILDINGS USE.

ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY SO

02:05:55.348 --> 02:05:59.252 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO

02:05:57.417 --> 02:06:01.587 region:rollup2
DO THESE BUILDINGS NOW IF YOU

02:05:59.252 --> 02:06:04.490 region:rollup2
START OUT WITH THAT DESIGN IN

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:05.358 region:rollup2

PATHWAYS TO BUILDING DE

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:56.188 region:rollup2
CARBONIZATION. THOSE THREE

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:57.023 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS ARE RENEWABLE GAS

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:58.491 region:rollup2
SOLAR THERMAL AND

02:09:57.023 --> 02:10:00.926 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE THREE IS

02:09:58.491 --> 02:10:02.728 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ONE THAT CARD CAUTIONS.

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:03.229 region:rollup2
THAT COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE AN

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:04.096 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN EMISSIONS IS

02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:06.365 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION.

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:07.366 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE THIS STRATEGY HAS A

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:08.634 region:rollup2
HIGH PURCHASE COST WITH HIGH

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:10.102 region:rollup2
INSTALLATION COSTS HIGHER LONG

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:10.936 region:rollup2
TERM OPERATING COSTS AND ALSO

02:10:10.102 --> 02:10:13.306 region:rollup2
CREATES MASSIVE NEW ELECTRICAL

02:10:13.306 --> 02:10:15.508 region:rollup2
THE FORTHCOMING STUDY THAT WILL

02:10:14.607 --> 02:10:16.409 region:rollup2
BE CIRCULATED YOUR OFFICES FINDS

02:10:15.508 --> 02:10:17.109 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO

02:10:16.409 --> 02:10:17.743 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFY THE BUILDING SECTOR IN

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:19.478 region:rollup2
ORDER TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:10:17.743 --> 02:10:20.980 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS. AND THAT REPLACING A

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:23.315 region:rollup2
MERE SIXTEEN PERCENT OF GAS

02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:24.116 region:rollup2
SUPPLY WITH RENEWABLE GAS FROM

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:25.084 region:rollup2
WAY STRINGS BY TWENTY THIRTY

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:26.852 region:rollup2
WOULD ACHIEVE THE SAME OUTCOME

02:10:25.084 --> 02:10:28.487 region:rollup2
AT LESS COST THAN ELECTRIFYING

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:30.423 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE BUILDING SECTOR IN

02:10:28.487 --> 02:10:31.691 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:10:30.423 --> 02:10:33.959 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THIS WOULD

PLAN WHICH IS A CRITICAL NEW

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:38.698 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE

02:10:37.563 --> 02:10:39.665 region:rollup2
STRATEGY. THE PLAN REQUIRES US

02:10:38.698 --> 02:10:41.233 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE FORTY PERCENT OF

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:43.102 region:rollup2

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:44.136 region:rollup2
STREAMS FROM SEWAGE TREATMENT

02:10:43.102 --> 02:10:45.538 region:rollup2
LANDFILLS AND AREAS. THE CAPTURE

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:46.939 region:rollup2
OF THESE POLLUTANTS REPRESENT

02:10:45.538 --> 02:10:48.607 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL THE

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:50.443 region:rollup2
EMISSION REDUCTIONS REQUIRED IN

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:51.110 region:rollup2
THE SCOPING PLAN TO REACH OUR

02:10:50.443 --> 02:10:53.846 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY GOALS.

02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:55.247 region:rollup2

OPTION OF USING OUR NOBLE GAS.

02:10:58.918 --> 02:11:02.221 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER ELECTRIFICATION IS A

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:03.589 region:rollup2
WELL THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY AT A

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:04.657 region:rollup2

SIR.

02:13:30.302 --> 02:13:34.139 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THE CDC

TO BASICALLY LOOK INTO THE GRID

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:38.310 region:rollup2

ITEM OF THE

02:19:26.592 --> 02:19:30.395 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A MANDATE WAS NO

02:19:28.794 --> 02:19:30.996 region:rollup2
MANDATE NO MEANT NOTHING TO THIS

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:31.630 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT THIS TO BE THE

02:19:30.996 --> 02:19:32.231 region:rollup2
FIRST WELL THINGS TO BE CLEAR

02:19:31.630 --> 02:19:33.999 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS

02:19:32.231 --> 02:19:35.534 region:rollup2
THE PLAN. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE.

02:19:33.999 --> 02:19:36.468 region:rollup2
WILL BE DEVELOPING PLANS

02:19:35.534 --> 02:19:37.502 region:rollup2
CORRECT SO THAT OVER TIME WE

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:39.571 region:rollup2
COULD MEET THOSE GOALS CORRECT

02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:40.572 region:rollup2
BUT AS I READ THERE'S. IT'S IT

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:43.275 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ALSO PLAN

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:43.909 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE AS PLAN

02:19:43.275 --> 02:19:47.212 region:rollup2
AND THEN DIRECTION BASED ON PLAN

02:19:43.909 --> 02:19:48.947 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:50.449 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN ULTIMATELY THEY

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:52.050 region:rollup2
WOULD IMPLEMENT THE PLANS.

02:19:50.449 --> 02:19:53.151 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE NOT IMPLEMENTING ANY

02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:56.154 region:rollup2
PLANS IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:57.422 region:rollup2
OF LEGISLATION.

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:58.357 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A STANDARDS OPTED FOR

02:19:57.422 --> 02:20:02.461 region:rollup2
ELECT WILL LOAD MANAGEMENT

02:19:58.357 --> 02:20:03.428 region:rollup2
FREEZE UTILITY AND TO ENSURE SO

02:20:02.461 --> 02:20:04.363 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT I'D SAY THEY WOULD

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:05.530 region:rollup2
LIKE WE WILL.

02:20:04.363 --> 02:20:07.299 region:rollup2
YEAH EVENTUALLY LIKE YOU WELL

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:08.133 region:rollup2
OKAY WHAT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

02:20:07.299 --> 02:20:09.001 region:rollup2
ALL PART OF THE SAME BILL.

02:20:08.133 --> 02:20:10.235 region:rollup2
WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY WHAT

02:20:09.001 --> 02:20:11.203 region:rollup2
THE PLAN IS

02:20:10.235 --> 02:20:11.703 region:rollup2
NO I JUST HAS WHATEVER PLAN THAT

02:20:11.203 --> 02:20:12.771 region:rollup2
YOU COME UP WITH WILL BE

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.772 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:14.072 region:rollup2
RIGHT A PLAN WILL EVENTUALLY BE

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:16.975 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED

02:20:14.072 --> 02:20:19.044 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:20.545 region:rollup2
BASED BASED ON THIS RIGHT TO

02:20:19.044 --> 02:20:21.046 region:rollup2
DISEASE NOT ACTIVITIES DOESN'T

02:20:20.545 --> 02:20:23.181 region:rollup2
COME BACK TO US AGAIN.

02:20:21.046 --> 02:20:24.182 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION.

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:24.983 region:rollup2
RIGHT OKAY RIGHT WE JUST FELT

02:20:24.182 --> 02:20:26.184 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY DEVELOP THE PLAN AND

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:28.086 region:rollup2
THEN THE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT

02:20:26.184 --> 02:20:28.854 region:rollup2
COMING BACK TO THE BODY.

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.788 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE

02:20:28.854 --> 02:20:32.357 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:33.358 region:rollup2
ON.

02:20:32.357 --> 02:20:34.393 region:rollup2
SO CAN I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS I

02:20:33.358 --> 02:20:36.862 region:rollup2
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT.

02:20:34.393 --> 02:20:38.664 region:rollup2
AND.

02:20:36.862 --> 02:20:40.399 region:rollup2
AND I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHO HAS.

02:20:38.664 --> 02:20:42.267 region:rollup2
A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT USE

02:20:40.399 --> 02:20:44.336 region:rollup2
PROPANE BUT WE ARE WAY OFF THE

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:45.237 region:rollup2
GRID WE HAVE SOLAR THAT WORKS

02:20:44.336 --> 02:20:47.773 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S AND CHENEY AND AT THE

02:20:45.237 --> 02:20:49.341 region:rollup2
TIME SO IT DOESN'T. A AND AND WE

02:20:47.773 --> 02:20:52.144 region:rollup2
USE PROPANE FOR FOR HEATING AND

02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:53.578 region:rollup2
COOKING. AND SO THAT IS A

02:20:52.144 --> 02:20:56.148 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT.

02:20:53.578 --> 02:20:56.782 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN JUST AS I AM AND

02:20:56.148 --> 02:20:58.216 region:rollup2
WHY I HAVE MULTIPLE CONCERNED

02:20:56.782 --> 02:20:59.217 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ANOTHER ONE IS.

02:20:58.216 --> 02:21:00.986 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON WHERE

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:01.586 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS

02:21:00.986 --> 02:21:03.322 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:04.623 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS. AND WE HAVE A

02:21:03.322 --> 02:21:06.124 region:rollup2
BEGIN BUILDING HOUSING STOCK

02:21:04.623 --> 02:21:06.758 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTING IT AGAIN RIGHT SO

02:21:06.124 --> 02:21:27.479 region:rollup2
WHILE. AND WE THERE WE THERE'S A

02:21:06.758 --> 02:21:30.983 region:rollup2
PENCIL OUT AT THIS

02:21:27.479 --> 02:21:42.327 region:rollup2
TIME AND SO WHEN WE CONTINUE TO

02:21:30.983 --> 02:21:46.698 region:rollup2
ADD MORE ONEROUS AND. STANDARDS

02:21:42.327 --> 02:22:03.382 region:rollup2
MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS THAT IT

02:21:46.698 --> 02:22:03.382 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE HOUSING

02:23:00.272 --> 02:23:16.388 region:rollup2
TYPE OF

02:23:16.755 --> 02:23:33.004 region:rollup2
REPEATING WOULD BE

02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:42.814 region:rollup2
YES AGAIN THIS IS NOT A BILL

02:23:39.111 --> 02:23:46.685 region:rollup2
ABOUT PURE ELECTRIFICATION. WE

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:50.922 region:rollup2
FULLY EXPECT THAT RENEWABLE

02:23:46.685 --> 02:23:52.190 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS WILL BE RESPECTED IN

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:54.326 region:rollup2
THESE PLANS AND WE UNDERSTAND IT

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:56.995 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IMPORTANT PART OF

02:23:54.326 --> 02:23:59.498 region:rollup2
COMBATING GREENHOUSE GAS

02:23:56.995 --> 02:24:03.468 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:23:59.498 --> 02:24:04.703 region:rollup2
AND GREAT MANAGEMENT WAS ALSO

02:24:03.468 --> 02:24:07.205 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP AND THAT'S

02:24:04.703 --> 02:24:13.245 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ALSO CALLED OUT A

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:14.746 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL THAT WE WILL. I'M

02:24:13.245 --> 02:24:15.814 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTED GRID MANAGEMENT BE

02:24:14.746 --> 02:24:16.414 region:rollup2
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE

02:24:15.814 --> 02:24:25.423 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PARTOF

02:24:16.414 --> 02:24:27.826 region:rollup2
IT'S EMISSIONS IT DOESN'T

02:24:25.423 --> 02:24:29.995 region:rollup2
INCLUDE EMISSIONS FROM THE

02:24:27.826 --> 02:24:33.298 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY USE FOR HEATING

02:24:29.995 --> 02:24:34.533 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO. PART OF THE MIX

02:24:33.298 --> 02:24:38.603 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA SO THE TOTAL

02:24:34.533 --> 02:24:40.839 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FROM. JUST HEATING HOT

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:43.708 region:rollup2
WATER AND SPACE ARE AT LEAST A

02:24:40.839 --> 02:24:54.386 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OFF A HIGHER.

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:57.289 region:rollup2
AND FOLLOW THE STATE NATURAL GAS

02:24:54.386 --> 02:25:00.959 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER TO BUILD A

02:24:57.289 --> 02:25:06.198 region:rollup2
SINGLE FUEL HOME THAT A DOUBLE

02:25:00.959 --> 02:25:08.133 region:rollup2
KNIT YOU'LL SHOW HOME YOU SAVE

02:25:06.198 --> 02:25:10.202 region:rollup2
MONEY AND APPLIANCES YOU SAVE

02:25:08.133 --> 02:25:14.906 region:rollup2
MONEY OF PLUMBING UP CONNECTION

02:25:10.202 --> 02:25:17.742 region:rollup2
COST. DOESN'T MEAN THAT HAS TO

02:25:14.906 --> 02:25:20.378 region:rollup2
BE THAT WAY BUT UNLOCKING THE

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:26.384 region:rollup2
SIZE OF ONE OPTION IS ACTUALLY

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:27.319 region:rollup2
GONNA HELP MAKE BUILDING NEW

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:31.723 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS MORE AFFORDABLE.

02:25:27.319 --> 02:25:32.624 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST POINT I WOULD LIKE

02:25:31.723 --> 02:25:34.960 region:rollup2
TO COMMENT ON SOME GREATER

02:25:32.624 --> 02:25:36.161 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY WE APPRECIATE THE

02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:49.541 region:rollup2
COMMENTS OF THE BE AYE A ON

02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:52.210 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY FAIRLY MINOR.

02:25:49.541 --> 02:25:55.380 region:rollup2
AND NEW LOAD COMPARED TO

02:25:52.210 --> 02:26:00.518 region:rollup2
ATTRITIONAL VEHICLES AND AND

02:25:55.380 --> 02:26:03.755 region:rollup2
SORA SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I WE

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:08.260 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THERE'S AND MAJOR

02:26:03.755 --> 02:26:10.929 region:rollup2
ISSUE HERE THINGS SORTED BEEN

02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:32.684 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT AND THE AGENCIES WOULD

02:26:10.929 --> 02:26:32.684 region:rollup2
HAVE PROCESSES. LIKE OF THE

02:26:36.588 --> 02:26:43.728 region:rollup2
FIFTY%

02:26:39.858 --> 02:26:46.531 region:rollup2
THREE WHICH WOULD.

02:26:43.728 --> 02:26:49.434 region:rollup2
I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO SHOW ME A

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:54.239 region:rollup2
CURRENT ELECTRIC STOVE WITH FULL

02:26:49.434 --> 02:26:57.542 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC COMPONENTS THAT IS

02:26:54.239 --> 02:27:00.378 region:rollup2
GOING TO LAST ME THAT LONG.

02:26:57.542 --> 02:27:07.619 region:rollup2
THE WASTE THAT WE GENERATE FROM

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:09.020 region:rollup2
NEW TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO COME

02:27:07.619 --> 02:27:11.723 region:rollup2
MAN AND THAT WE GET A NEW ONE

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:15.160 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE NEW MANDATES. IS

02:27:11.723 --> 02:27:18.596 region:rollup2
GOING TO OVERWHELM THIS PLANET

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:22.067 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY FASTER THAN SOME OF

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:28.073 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WE WORK ON.

02:27:22.067 --> 02:27:30.375 region:rollup2
AGREED FOCUSED ON PROVIDING

02:27:28.073 --> 02:27:31.309 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE NATURAL GAS RELIABLY

02:27:30.375 --> 02:27:33.078 region:rollup2
TO THEIR SCHOOLS HOSPITALS

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:34.713 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

02:27:33.078 --> 02:27:36.881 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS CALIFORNIA IS

02:27:34.713 --> 02:27:38.717 region:rollup2
DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS ON A FULL

02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:39.551 region:rollup2
FUEL CYCLE BASIS WITH THREE

02:27:38.717 --> 02:27:40.318 region:rollup2
TIMES THE EFFICIENCY OF

02:27:39.551 --> 02:27:41.820 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY AND ONE THIRD THE

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:43.488 region:rollup2
COST.

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:44.956 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE ALL ELECTRIC HOME

02:27:43.488 --> 02:27:47.158 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:48.193 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR MORE THAN AT HOME

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:49.828 region:rollup2
WITH NATURAL GAS APPLIANCES IN

02:27:48.193 --> 02:27:52.964 region:rollup2
IT. SO OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED

02:27:49.828 --> 02:27:55.800 region:rollup2
ABOUT A MOVE FOR ELECTRIFICATION

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:58.269 region:rollup2
A KNOW. IT BECOMES AT THIS IS

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.671 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT THAT ONE WITNESS

02:27:58.269 --> 02:28:02.140 region:rollup2
SAID IT WAS. MOVED WAS

02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:04.042 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION AND IMPACT IS

02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:08.012 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE A LOW INCOME

02:28:04.042 --> 02:28:08.580 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:08.813 region:rollup2
THAT'S SO THAT CLEARS IT UP.

02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:11.049 region:rollup2
.

02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:11.683 region:rollup2
SO I.

02:28:11.049 --> 02:28:12.383 region:rollup2
I WERE I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE

02:28:11.683 --> 02:28:13.284 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO.

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:13.952 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:15.720 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY BECAUSE PARTICULARLY

02:28:13.952 --> 02:28:17.822 region:rollup2
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HOW

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:18.690 region:rollup2
HIGH THEY ARE NOW AND IN FACT I

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:20.992 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT

02:28:18.690 --> 02:28:22.193 region:rollup2
PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL

02:28:20.992 --> 02:28:23.161 region:rollup2
AVERAGE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:25.130 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

02:28:23.161 --> 02:28:26.197 region:rollup2
COMMENTS MADE BY.

02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:28.867 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM

02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:30.535 region:rollup2
STOCKTON WITH A PREFERENCE TO.

02:28:28.867 --> 02:28:32.103 region:rollup2
ON WHAT TYPE OF THE PLANTS ONE

02:28:30.535 --> 02:28:34.806 region:rollup2
WOULD COOK ON IN THEIR HOME AND

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:35.006 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT OPTION BEING TAKEN

02:28:34.806 --> 02:28:36.241 region:rollup2
AWAY.

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:38.076 region:rollup2
.

02:28:36.241 --> 02:28:39.711 region:rollup2
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:28:38.076 --> 02:28:41.679 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER DAY OF SOLAR COMPANY

02:28:39.711 --> 02:28:43.314 region:rollup2
IS CALLING MY HOME TELLING ME

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:44.749 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GREAT DEALS THAT ARE

02:28:43.314 --> 02:28:47.018 region:rollup2
GOING ON THERE STATE SANCTIONED

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:49.187 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:51.589 region:rollup2
THE THE.

02:28:49.187 --> 02:28:53.124 region:rollup2
FURTHER PROLIFERATION OF SOLAR

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:54.893 region:rollup2
USE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS.

02:28:53.124 --> 02:28:55.693 region:rollup2
MORE WIDESPREAD CERTAINLY MORE

02:28:54.893 --> 02:28:57.962 region:rollup2
SO THAN OTHER STATES.

02:28:55.693 --> 02:29:00.532 region:rollup2
.

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:03.001 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST SEE THE COST RISING

02:29:00.532 --> 02:29:04.235 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE FOR HOMEOWNERS OR

02:29:03.001 --> 02:29:06.204 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL HOMEOWNERS IN

02:29:04.235 --> 02:29:07.472 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND WERE ALREADY HAD

02:29:06.204 --> 02:29:09.374 region:rollup2
A CRISIS.

02:29:07.472 --> 02:29:10.175 region:rollup2
CRISIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN

02:29:09.374 --> 02:29:12.777 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND

02:29:10.175 --> 02:29:13.778 region:rollup2
WHAT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS.

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:16.915 region:rollup2
WE ARE THERE.

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:17.215 region:rollup2
I I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOUR

02:29:16.915 --> 02:29:19.117 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD.

02:29:17.215 --> 02:29:21.119 region:rollup2
.

02:29:19.117 --> 02:29:23.555 region:rollup2
BE THEY THE SOLE REASON WHY THE

02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:25.156 region:rollup2
WHOLE HOUSE COMES FALLING DOWN

02:29:23.555 --> 02:29:27.892 region:rollup2
PARDON THE PUN.

02:29:25.156 --> 02:29:29.594 region:rollup2
BUT I AM SUGGESTING THAT THIS

02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:31.329 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO HELP

02:29:29.594 --> 02:29:33.231 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE CONTINUE TO PUT

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:34.199 region:rollup2
MANDATES ON THAT HOMEBUILDING

02:29:33.231 --> 02:29:36.634 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:29:34.199 --> 02:29:38.436 region:rollup2
AND.

02:29:36.634 --> 02:29:41.272 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO.

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:43.508 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COST TO RISE FEWER

02:29:41.272 --> 02:29:46.077 region:rollup2
AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO

02:29:43.508 --> 02:29:47.278 region:rollup2
AFFORD A HOME IN CALIFORNIA.

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:48.079 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:49.113 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING

02:29:48.079 --> 02:29:51.516 region:rollup2
THEY DO AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:53.084 region:rollup2
WAY WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM WENT

02:29:51.516 --> 02:29:54.619 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:56.421 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IN THE AND THE AND THE

02:29:54.619 --> 02:29:57.689 region:rollup2
HOUSING ISSUE THE AVERAGE HOME

02:29:56.421 --> 02:29:59.157 region:rollup2
PRICES IN THE BAY AREA'S IT

02:29:57.689 --> 02:30:01.092 region:rollup2
UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:29:59.157 --> 02:30:02.193 region:rollup2
WHO CAN AFFORD THAT?

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:03.061 region:rollup2
THAT PRICE IS GOING TO CONTINUE

02:30:02.193 --> 02:30:04.295 region:rollup2
TO GO UP.

02:30:03.061 --> 02:30:05.697 region:rollup2
SO I

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:07.999 region:rollup2
I WOULD.

02:30:05.697 --> 02:30:09.434 region:rollup2
BE HAPPY

02:30:07.999 --> 02:30:10.969 region:rollup2
TO SIT AND TALK MORE.

02:30:09.434 --> 02:30:13.471 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:14.739 region:rollup2
AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY WE

02:30:13.471 --> 02:30:18.276 region:rollup2
COULD I'M SURE THERE'S SOME.

02:30:14.739 --> 02:30:19.978 region:rollup2
IDEAS THAT WE WOULD AGREE ON.

02:30:18.276 --> 02:30:21.513 region:rollup2
BUT THIS ONE LIKE I JUST CAN'T A

02:30:19.978 --> 02:30:23.181 region:rollup2
GRAND GIVEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:30:21.513 --> 02:30:24.215 region:rollup2
WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY HOME IN

02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:26.918 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA GIVEN NUMBER OF

02:30:24.215 --> 02:30:28.486 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. WHO CAN AFFORD TO BUY

02:30:26.918 --> 02:30:29.020 region:rollup2
HOME TO KEEP FIND WHAT TO BUY

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:30.622 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY JUST AREN'T

02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:31.890 region:rollup2
BUILDING THEM FAST ENOUGH SO AM

02:30:30.622 --> 02:30:33.057 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE BILL

02:30:31.890 --> 02:30:35.994 region:rollup2
FOR THE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:39.531 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SUPPORT A TODAY?

02:30:35.994 --> 02:30:41.866 region:rollup2
MR ACOSTA THAN MR MCCARTY.

02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:43.101 region:rollup2
UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:45.203 region:rollup2
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR

02:30:43.101 --> 02:30:46.871 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I I

02:30:45.203 --> 02:30:48.406 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL.

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:50.375 region:rollup2
I ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:51.609 region:rollup2
THAT THAT HAVE BEEN.

02:30:50.375 --> 02:30:53.211 region:rollup2
SHARED AYE I HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:54.846 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I MEAN I.

02:30:53.211 --> 02:30:57.248 region:rollup2
I KEEP HEARING THAT THIS IS

02:30:54.846 --> 02:30:58.783 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WHICH IT

02:30:57.248 --> 02:30:59.651 region:rollup2
APPEARS TO BE I'M FOR OWES VERY

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:00.952 region:rollup2
CONCERNED BY SOME OF THE BACK

02:30:59.651 --> 02:31:04.322 region:rollup2
AND FORTH THOUGH ABOUT THE

02:31:00.952 --> 02:31:05.123 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION VERSES A STUDY.

02:31:04.322 --> 02:31:07.225 region:rollup2
CELEBRITY A STUDY BUT I'M GONNA

02:31:05.123 --> 02:31:07.825 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT SAID STUDY WITHOUT IT

02:31:07.225 --> 02:31:09.527 region:rollup2
CAME BACK TO THIS THIS SAGA.

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:11.596 region:rollup2
.

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:13.498 region:rollup2
THIS BODY HAS COMMITTEE.

02:31:11.596 --> 02:31:16.134 region:rollup2
.

02:31:13.498 --> 02:31:18.202 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH SO.

02:31:16.134 --> 02:31:20.038 region:rollup2
DO YOU DO YOU ENVISION WITH THIS

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:21.272 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IN THIS BILL. THAT

02:31:20.038 --> 02:31:22.607 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:24.676 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE IF I GO TO SELL

02:31:22.607 --> 02:31:28.079 region:rollup2
MY HOME I HAVE TO CHANGE OUT

02:31:24.676 --> 02:31:29.414 region:rollup2
APPLIANCES. OR RETRO FIT OR OR

02:31:28.079 --> 02:31:31.015 region:rollup2
OR ANY OF THAT IS THAT KIND OF

02:31:29.414 --> 02:31:31.349 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE IT SEEMS

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:33.685 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT'S.

02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:37.255 region:rollup2
THE GOAL HERE.

02:31:33.685 --> 02:31:38.957 region:rollup2
FOR EXISTING EXISTING HOMES.

02:31:37.255 --> 02:31:40.258 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE

02:31:38.957 --> 02:31:42.260 region:rollup2
GOAL I DON'T I MEAN I DON'T KNOW

02:31:40.258 --> 02:31:44.195 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD END

02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:45.797 region:rollup2
UP BEING PART OF ANY PLAN. I

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:47.932 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE THAT.

02:31:45.797 --> 02:31:49.367 region:rollup2
WE DON'T PREMATURELY KIND OF TRY

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:51.102 region:rollup2
TO SECOND GUESS WHAT'S GOING TO

02:31:49.367 --> 02:31:53.004 region:rollup2
BE IN THAT PLAN AFTER LENGTHY

02:31:51.102 --> 02:31:54.839 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEARINGS AFTER OR. PEOPLE

02:31:53.004 --> 02:31:57.308 region:rollup2
WAY ON THE BEST AND MOST COST

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:58.910 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY. OF REACHING OUR

02:31:57.308 --> 02:32:00.612 region:rollup2
GOALS YOU KNOW AGAIN WE THINK

02:31:58.910 --> 02:32:01.713 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BEGIN

02:32:00.612 --> 02:32:03.114 region:rollup2
THE GOAL SETTING PROCESS AND TO

02:32:01.713 --> 02:32:05.183 region:rollup2
HAVE A TARGET.

02:32:03.114 --> 02:32:07.018 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE SO AFRAID OF

02:32:05.183 --> 02:32:08.252 region:rollup2
WHAT MIGHT COME ALONG THE WAY

02:32:07.018 --> 02:32:10.021 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN WILLING.

02:32:08.252 --> 02:32:11.789 region:rollup2
I TRIED TO HAVE A GOAL OR TRY TO

02:32:10.021 --> 02:32:13.124 region:rollup2
HAVE A TARGET TO REDUCE WHAT'S

02:32:11.789 --> 02:32:15.059 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR LARGEST SOURCES OF

02:32:13.124 --> 02:32:17.061 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:18.229 region:rollup2
SO UMBER.

02:32:17.061 --> 02:32:20.298 region:rollup2
IT I COULDN'T TELL YOU RIGHT

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:21.699 region:rollup2
THIS MOMENT HOW THAT GOAL IS

02:32:20.298 --> 02:32:23.101 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE MET BUT WE HEARD

02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:25.370 region:rollup2
SOME IDEAS TODAY WE HEARD ABOUT

02:32:23.101 --> 02:32:26.838 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE NATURAL

02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:28.840 region:rollup2
GAS WHICH CAN ALSO POWER. THOSE

02:32:26.838 --> 02:32:29.807 region:rollup2
GAS STOVES EVERYBODY LOVES YOU

02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:30.541 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:32.343 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE GOAL

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:35.146 region:rollup2
PERHAPS BRINGING IN OTHER TYPES

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:36.681 region:rollup2
OF FUEL SOURCES A GEOTHERMAL. OF

02:32:35.146 --> 02:32:38.249 region:rollup2
USING MORE SOLAR THERE'S A LOT

02:32:36.681 --> 02:32:39.250 region:rollup2
OF WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE DONE

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:41.452 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:42.987 region:rollup2
OVER TIME A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:44.522 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO PUT MORE AFFECTION

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:45.890 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INTO THEIR

02:32:44.522 --> 02:32:47.125 region:rollup2
HOMES THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:49.694 region:rollup2
GET REBATES SOMETIMES EMPOWER

02:32:47.125 --> 02:32:50.795 region:rollup2
UTILITIES BECAUSE THE OLD ONES.

02:32:49.694 --> 02:32:52.263 region:rollup2
WEAR OUT AND THEY DECIDE TO

02:32:50.795 --> 02:32:53.531 region:rollup2
REPLACE HIM AND BECAUSE NOW

02:32:52.263 --> 02:32:56.434 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT

02:32:53.531 --> 02:32:57.068 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. AND PART

02:32:56.434 --> 02:32:57.802 region:rollup2
OF THE IDEA OF SETTING THE GOAL

02:32:57.068 --> 02:32:59.704 region:rollup2
IS TO.

02:32:57.802 --> 02:33:01.272 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THAT MARKET SIGNAL TO

02:32:59.704 --> 02:33:02.940 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:04.609 region:rollup2
WHO DEVELOP APPLIES TO SAY THIS

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:06.544 region:rollup2
IS OUR GOAL.

02:33:04.609 --> 02:33:08.079 region:rollup2
KENMORE SEARS WE WANT YOU TO

02:33:06.544 --> 02:33:09.514 region:rollup2
START GOING OUT AND COMING UP

02:33:08.079 --> 02:33:10.748 region:rollup2
WITH REALLY GREAT APPLIANCES

02:33:09.514 --> 02:33:12.684 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THAT ARE.

02:33:10.748 --> 02:33:14.652 region:rollup2
ZERO EMISSIONS WITHOUT DOING

02:33:12.684 --> 02:33:15.286 region:rollup2
THAT WITHOUT HAVING THAT GOAL

02:33:14.652 --> 02:33:17.422 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO SEND THAT MARKETS

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:19.023 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO HOW TO IT'S HARD TO

02:33:17.422 --> 02:33:20.358 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE CHOICES MAN. COME ON

02:33:19.023 --> 02:33:22.026 region:rollup2
THE SHELVES THE SAME WAY THAT

02:33:20.358 --> 02:33:23.261 region:rollup2
NOW WATER EFFICIENCY CHOICES OF

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:26.030 region:rollup2
COME ON THE SHELVES.

02:33:23.261 --> 02:33:26.798 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WOULD ASK ME TEN YEARS

02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:28.332 region:rollup2
AGO ABOUT THE DROUGHT NOT GONNA

02:33:26.798 --> 02:33:30.268 region:rollup2
WE ARE WIENER REQUIRE HOMEOWNERS

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:31.369 region:rollup2
TO GO OUT AND. RETROFIT ALL OF

02:33:30.268 --> 02:33:33.237 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSES WITH WATER SEEPING

02:33:31.369 --> 02:33:34.238 region:rollup2
WELL WE ENDED UP NOT GOING THERE

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:35.940 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE MARKET ITSELF ONCE

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:37.408 region:rollup2
WE KEEP THAT SIGNAL PROVIDED

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:38.910 region:rollup2
THOSE APPLIANCES AND MADE THOSE

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:40.244 region:rollup2
CHOICES ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS.

02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:42.046 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IS A LOT BETTER WAY

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:43.581 region:rollup2
OF GOING ABOUT GETTING TO

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:45.083 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY.

02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:47.585 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE MARKET

02:33:45.083 --> 02:33:49.687 region:rollup2
WILL START DOING THAT ON THEIR

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:53.024 region:rollup2
OWN ON ITS OWN ONCE WE SEND

02:33:49.687 --> 02:33:56.928 region:rollup2
THOSE SIGNALS DIFFERENT THINGS

02:33:53.024 --> 02:33:58.096 region:rollup2
TO ADD. BUT JUST OUT OF THAT YOU

02:33:56.928 --> 02:34:00.098 region:rollup2
KNOW BY PROVIDING THIS MONTH

02:33:58.096 --> 02:34:02.700 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY SIGNAL WILL DRIVE

02:34:00.098 --> 02:34:03.735 region:rollup2
INNOVATION INVESTMENTS AND JUST

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:05.837 region:rollup2
LIKE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE

02:34:03.735 --> 02:34:07.605 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE OPTION OF

02:34:05.837 --> 02:34:10.641 region:rollup2
HAVING. CARS POWERED BY

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:15.246 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY HYBRIDS HYDROGEN

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:17.748 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS THAT HAS REPLACED

02:34:15.246 --> 02:34:20.518 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE CHOI HAD TO HAVE WITH

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:23.287 region:rollup2
A DIFFICULT BUT NO A GASOLINE

02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:25.356 region:rollup2
COMBUSTION ENGINE BEFORE THIS OF

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:28.159 region:rollup2
SAMETIME BILLS HOW DO WE MAKE

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:33.865 region:rollup2
THESE OPTIONS. WHICH ARE CHEAPER

02:34:28.159 --> 02:34:39.570 region:rollup2
HEALTHIER CLEANER VENABLE TO THE

02:34:33.865 --> 02:34:40.104 region:rollup2
PLOT OF POPULATIONS HAVE JUST

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:41.172 region:rollup2
THE WEALTHIER CALIFORNIA'S

02:34:40.104 --> 02:34:41.906 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:34:41.172 --> 02:34:42.240 region:rollup2
HOW TO SAY AS WE JUST HEARD FROM

02:34:41.906 --> 02:34:42.840 region:rollup2
THE ARCHITECTS

02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:50.515 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT GREENLEE THESE ARE

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:52.550 region:rollup2
HOUSES GO

02:34:50.515 --> 02:34:53.684 region:rollup2
BACK THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT

02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:54.652 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT KIND OF MONEY IT'S

02:34:53.684 --> 02:34:56.888 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A LOT OF OTHER

02:34:54.652 --> 02:34:57.488 region:rollup2
FACTORS LIKE THE PRICE OF LAND?

02:34:56.888 --> 02:34:58.856 region:rollup2
AND OUT AND POPULATION GROWTH

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:59.857 region:rollup2
SO.

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:01.993 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT THE

02:34:59.857 --> 02:35:04.095 region:rollup2
CONNECTION IS YOU KNOW. QUITE

02:35:01.993 --> 02:35:04.862 region:rollup2
THAT CLEAR OBVIOUS.

02:35:04.095 --> 02:35:07.565 region:rollup2
WELL I I DO APPRECIATE

02:35:04.862 --> 02:35:08.499 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT WAS.

02:35:07.565 --> 02:35:09.700 region:rollup2
JUST STATED AS A LOT OF

02:35:08.499 --> 02:35:10.735 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HERE.

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:12.403 region:rollup2
I.

02:35:10.735 --> 02:35:13.004 region:rollup2
FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WE JUST

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:14.405 region:rollup2
HAD A BILL EARLIER REGARDING

02:35:13.004 --> 02:35:16.174 region:rollup2
SEQUEL.

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:17.408 region:rollup2
I AM ONE OF MY COMMENTS ABOUT

02:35:16.174 --> 02:35:18.709 region:rollup2
SEQUEL WAS THAT OR ABOUT THAT

02:35:17.408 --> 02:35:20.811 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL WAS THAT.

02:35:18.709 --> 02:35:21.412 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S ONLY IF IT THAT'S NOT

02:35:20.811 --> 02:35:21.646 region:rollup2
ALL OF THAT THAT'S ONLY A PART

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:25.349 region:rollup2
OF IT.

02:35:21.646 --> 02:35:26.317 region:rollup2
AND THEN HERE WE ARE.

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:27.485 region:rollup2
EVEN SO SO GO AHEAD AND DON'T DO

02:35:26.317 --> 02:35:28.920 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ABOUT SEQUEL AND THEN

02:35:27.485 --> 02:35:31.789 region:rollup2

DISAGREEING WITH THE FOLKS THAT

02:35:46.971 --> 02:35:47.939 region:rollup2

.

02:36:20.004 --> 02:36:24.008 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THESE ISSUES GOING ON

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:24.609 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WERE CALLING A

02:36:24.008 --> 02:36:32.550 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS A CRISIS IF YOU

02:36:24.609 --> 02:36:34.619 region:rollup2
CRISIS THAT OUR COUNTRY

FACED.

02:36:36.354 --> 02:36:40.925 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY DOING

02:36:37.021 --> 02:36:44.262 region:rollup2
ANYTHING?

02:36:40.925 --> 02:36:45.463 region:rollup2
EXCEPT EXACERBATE SAID CRISIS.

02:36:44.262 --> 02:36:47.865 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON SECA WE

02:36:45.463 --> 02:36:50.134 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON ON.

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:52.770 region:rollup2
I'M KEEPING THE COST AND COST

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:53.537 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT DOWN

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:55.072 region:rollup2
WERE IT WE HAVE.

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:58.376 region:rollup2
.

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:59.377 region:rollup2
SOME TESTIMONY THAT SAYS THIS

02:36:58.376 --> 02:37:01.045 region:rollup2
WILL INCREASE COSTS WE WILL

02:36:59.377 --> 02:37:03.447 region:rollup2
ATTEST MY SAYS IT WON'T WE'RE

02:37:01.045 --> 02:37:05.583 region:rollup2
GONNA DO A PLAN WHICH I AM ALL

02:37:03.447 --> 02:37:06.984 region:rollup2
FOR STUDY BILL.

02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:07.551 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO

02:37:06.984 --> 02:37:08.786 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN WITHOUT

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:10.855 region:rollup2
COMING BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR.

02:37:08.786 --> 02:37:11.522 region:rollup2
CHAMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE SO I

02:37:10.855 --> 02:37:12.957 region:rollup2

WITHOUT MORE FACTS.

02:37:16.761 --> 02:37:18.629 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THE LOT OF

02:37:17.662 --> 02:37:19.730 region:rollup2
SUPPOSITION.

02:37:18.629 --> 02:37:21.632 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET.

02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:23.200 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE WITHOUT ADDING A HUGE

02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:25.603 region:rollup2
COST IN A BURDEN TO NEW

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:26.437 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS AS I MENTIONED PRIOR

02:37:25.603 --> 02:37:28.339 region:rollup2
OUR CHILDREN CANNOT AFFORD TO

02:37:26.437 --> 02:37:29.907 region:rollup2
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:37:28.339 --> 02:37:32.076 region:rollup2
FIFTH PERIOD UNLESS THEY'RE VERY

02:37:29.907 --> 02:37:36.147 region:rollup2

BLUE COLLAR WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE

02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:43.454 region:rollup2
ARE BEING DRIVEN OUT AND THEIR

02:37:41.786 --> 02:37:44.989 region:rollup2
CURRENT BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THE

02:37:43.454 --> 02:37:46.457 region:rollup2
SUBURBS AND THEY WERE NOT

02:37:44.989 --> 02:37:47.725 region:rollup2
LETTING THE SUBURBS BUILT HOUSES

02:37:46.457 --> 02:37:49.293 region:rollup2
EITHER.

02:37:47.725 --> 02:37:50.661 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BILLS LIKE THIS THAT R.

02:37:49.293 --> 02:37:51.295 region:rollup2
STUNTING THAT GROWTH I'M I

02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:52.296 region:rollup2

THAT DOESN'T IN MY HUMBLE

02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:57.368 region:rollup2
OPINION. BOB HARM WHAT WORKED

02:37:56.734 --> 02:37:58.970 region:rollup2
THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF TRYING TO

02:37:57.368 --> 02:37:59.637 region:rollup2
PRODUCE MORE HOUSING WHILE WE'RE

02:37:58.970 --> 02:38:01.739 region:rollup2
BEING CLEANER AND I THINK WE CAN

02:37:59.637 --> 02:38:03.708 region:rollup2
DO BOTH I DON'T THINK THIS IS

02:38:01.739 --> 02:38:05.509 region:rollup2
THE VEHICLE FOR IT I LOVE TO SEE

02:38:03.708 --> 02:38:08.579 region:rollup2
IT AS A STUDY BILL.

02:38:05.509 --> 02:38:11.048 region:rollup2
BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW I AM A VERY

02:38:08.579 --> 02:38:13.684 region:rollup2
FIRM NO ON THIS PARTICULAR

SECOND OKAY AND THEN JUST JUST

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:32.703 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS AND SO I I

02:38:30.835 --> 02:38:34.038 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS MEASURE RIGHT I

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:35.039 region:rollup2
NOTICE IT'S JUST THREE WORDS A

02:38:34.038 --> 02:38:36.540 region:rollup2
CAT TEMPERATE THE PLAN.

02:38:35.039 --> 02:38:37.375 region:rollup2
IT'S FIFTY PERCENT TWENTY THIRTY

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.242 region:rollup2
IS A LOT OF VARIABLES TO

02:38:37.375 --> 02:38:39.744 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THIS.

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:41.145 region:rollup2
I WILL KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

02:38:39.744 --> 02:38:42.880 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING STOCK EVEN NOT HOT

02:38:41.145 --> 02:38:44.315 region:rollup2
AREA LIKE SACRAMENTO.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.483 region:rollup2

SAVE A CAN MAKE THESE RIGHT AT

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:54.592 region:rollup2

03:09:57.519 --> 03:10:02.691 region:rollup2
NAM. AS THEY BOTH REPUBLIC IN

03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:04.126 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED. OF

03:10:02.691 --> 03:10:05.494 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION IS IMPROVING

03:10:04.126 --> 03:10:07.997 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD THING WE'VE SEEN

03:10:05.494 --> 03:10:09.565 region:rollup2
PROGRESS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT I

03:10:07.997 --> 03:10:12.234 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST OF OPERATIONAL.

03:10:09.565 --> 03:10:14.570 region:rollup2
.

03:10:12.234 --> 03:10:16.639 region:rollup2
STEPS THAT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT

03:10:14.570 --> 03:10:17.840 region:rollup2
SOURCES HAVE TAKEN STEPS THAT.

03:10:16.639 --> 03:10:20.342 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST HAVE LARGELY

03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:22.011 region:rollup2
BEEN DRIVEN BY THE REGULATOR IN

03:10:20.342 --> 03:10:23.379 region:rollup2
THIS CASE MY AGENCY.

03:10:22.011 --> 03:10:25.681 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE WORKED WITH THE ODOR

03:10:23.379 --> 03:10:27.116 region:rollup2
SOURCES TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR

03:10:25.681 --> 03:10:29.251 region:rollup2
IS TO CUT ODORS

03:10:27.116 --> 03:10:30.986 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM HOUSING GONE AWAY.

03:10:29.251 --> 03:10:34.023 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT HOUSING.

03:10:30.986 --> 03:10:35.291 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NOW.

03:10:34.023 --> 03:10:36.825 region:rollup2
TO A LANDFILL THAT HAS BEEN

03:10:35.291 --> 03:10:37.726 region:rollup2
THERE FOR NOT A HUNDRED YEARS

03:10:36.825 --> 03:10:39.662 region:rollup2
BUT GETTING CLOSE.

03:10:37.726 --> 03:10:41.030 region:rollup2
HOWEVER

03:10:39.662 --> 03:10:42.831 region:rollup2
LIKE TO GET TO THIS MONTH SAYS

03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:44.433 region:rollup2
YOU DO REPRESENT THAT. THE

03:10:42.831 --> 03:10:45.434 region:rollup2
ELEAZER IN THIS THE CENTER THE

03:10:44.433 --> 03:10:47.136 region:rollup2
REGULATORS.

03:10:45.434 --> 03:10:48.804 region:rollup2
I TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

03:10:47.136 --> 03:10:51.507 region:rollup2
RIGHT PATH IS I DON'T SEE

03:10:48.804 --> 03:10:54.476 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TEETH IN THIS.

03:10:51.507 --> 03:10:56.211 region:rollup2
IF THIS GETS MOVE FORWARD.

03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:57.913 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE.

03:10:56.211 --> 03:10:58.847 region:rollup2
THE SADDEST CHO DOESN'T REALLY

03:10:57.913 --> 03:11:01.417 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

03:10:58.847 --> 03:11:03.218 region:rollup2
SO.

03:11:01.417 --> 03:11:04.987 region:rollup2
WHO'S IN CHARGE LISTA CHAIR

03:11:03.218 --> 03:11:07.056 region:rollup2
THROUGH YOU TO TO TRY TO RESPOND

03:11:04.987 --> 03:11:08.357 region:rollup2
TO IT. IT'S PROBABLY EIGHTEEN

03:11:07.056 --> 03:11:10.159 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THAT.

03:11:08.357 --> 03:11:12.928 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COSTA PASTA

03:11:10.159 --> 03:11:15.631 region:rollup2
BILL AND THAT ACTUALLY CLARIFIED

03:11:12.928 --> 03:11:17.800 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRIMACY AGENCY IS THE

03:11:15.631 --> 03:11:19.068 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THE

03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:20.469 region:rollup2
SOLID IN THE SOLID WASTE.

03:11:19.068 --> 03:11:21.670 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AGENCY THE AMBER THE

03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:22.971 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT HEALTH FOLKS.

03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:24.073 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON THAT WAS DONE IS

03:11:22.971 --> 03:11:26.175 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY ISSUE THE

03:11:24.073 --> 03:11:28.177 region:rollup2
PERMIT.

03:11:26.175 --> 03:11:29.211 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS CLEARLY

03:11:28.177 --> 03:11:30.913 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN OVER OTA

03:11:29.211 --> 03:11:32.614 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS.

03:11:30.913 --> 03:11:34.550 region:rollup2
AS WITH ANYTHING AS WITH WASTE

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:36.318 region:rollup2
WATER TREATMENT OR. ABATTOIR

03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:37.853 region:rollup2
UNITED SLAUGHTERHOUSES SOMETHING

03:11:36.318 --> 03:11:39.922 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OD ISSUES.

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:41.757 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE WITH THE MOLE WAS THAT

03:11:39.922 --> 03:11:42.891 region:rollup2
THE ED DISTRICTS HAVE EXPLICIT

03:11:41.757 --> 03:11:44.560 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

03:11:42.891 --> 03:11:45.561 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS ODORS

03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:47.363 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE FINES AND

03:11:45.561 --> 03:11:48.864 region:rollup2
PENALTIES AUTHORITY.

03:11:47.363 --> 03:11:50.165 region:rollup2
ALL CONCERN WAS THE LOCAL

03:11:48.864 --> 03:11:51.667 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACTUALLY

03:11:50.165 --> 03:11:53.836 region:rollup2
ISSUE THE PERMITS

03:11:51.667 --> 03:11:56.271 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT TIME WE CREATED THIS

03:11:53.836 --> 03:11:57.873 region:rollup2
PROCESS SCHOOL O. TO IMPACT MATT

03:11:56.271 --> 03:11:59.808 region:rollup2
AND MITIGATION PROGRAM.

03:11:57.873 --> 03:12:01.410 region:rollup2
AND THAT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO

03:11:59.808 --> 03:12:03.245 region:rollup2
MITIGATE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

03:12:01.410 --> 03:12:05.247 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THOSE OTIS WE CANNOT

03:12:03.245 --> 03:12:06.615 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THEM.

03:12:05.247 --> 03:12:07.950 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE AS PRIMARILY ONE OF

03:12:06.615 --> 03:12:10.452 region:rollup2
LAND USE

03:12:07.950 --> 03:12:13.022 region:rollup2
NOT OF IN ADEQUATE REGULATION BY

03:12:10.452 --> 03:12:15.023 region:rollup2
THE NE A OR CALORIE CYCLE OR

03:12:13.022 --> 03:12:16.658 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ELSE YOU GO PEOPLE

03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:18.627 region:rollup2
MOVING INTO A NUISANCE.

03:12:16.658 --> 03:12:20.696 region:rollup2
AS YOU DO ALL THE TIME.

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:22.798 region:rollup2
AS YOU SQUEEZE HOUSES RIGHT UP

03:12:20.696 --> 03:12:24.733 region:rollup2
TO THE AGE SO YOU HAD A PRE

03:12:22.798 --> 03:12:25.467 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAND FULL. NOW YOU

03:12:24.733 --> 03:12:27.269 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE SOME.

03:12:25.467 --> 03:12:28.771 region:rollup2
DOES IN THE LANDFILL BUT WE

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:30.139 region:rollup2
HAVE THE PLAN IN PLACE.

03:12:28.771 --> 03:12:31.940 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN AS OTHERS HAVE

03:12:30.139 --> 03:12:34.777 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED AS YOU TRY TO

03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:36.812 region:rollup2
ADDRESS RECYCLING IN THE STATE.

03:12:34.777 --> 03:12:38.013 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IS

03:12:36.812 --> 03:12:38.414 region:rollup2
GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

03:12:38.013 --> 03:12:40.616 region:rollup2
AND IT OBFUSCATE.

03:12:38.414 --> 03:12:41.884 region:rollup2
IN PROCESS.

03:12:40.616 --> 03:12:42.684 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION AND

03:12:41.884 --> 03:12:44.253 region:rollup2
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A FURTHER

03:12:42.684 --> 03:12:45.187 region:rollup2
RESPONSE

03:12:44.253 --> 03:12:46.655 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO

03:12:45.187 --> 03:12:48.190 region:rollup2
DO.

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:49.658 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE I

03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:51.226 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT IT CHANGES

03:12:49.658 --> 03:12:52.494 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ON THE GROUNDS AND

03:12:51.226 --> 03:12:53.662 region:rollup2
MISCHA I'M I'M PREPARED TO GIVE

03:12:52.494 --> 03:12:55.397 region:rollup2

WITH THIS ON THE FLOOR.

03:12:55.898 --> 03:13:00.969 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:12:58.367 --> 03:13:03.238 region:rollup2
IT'S ITS A SOLUTION THAT MAY

03:13:00.969 --> 03:13:05.140 region:rollup2
SATISFY SOME FOLKS BUT. IT'S

03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:07.476 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THIS

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:09.545 region:rollup2
IS JUST.

03:13:07.476 --> 03:13:12.781 region:rollup2
CUT A SPINNING O. WE'LL AND AND

03:13:09.545 --> 03:13:14.249 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY NOT REALLY. GOING TO.

03:13:12.781 --> 03:13:16.118 region:rollup2
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S

03:13:14.249 --> 03:13:17.152 region:rollup2
UP TO LOCAL REGULATORS I DON'T

OF THE COW RECYCLE THIS THE

03:13:17.152 --> 03:13:21.423 region:rollup2
RIGHT. PARTY TO BE DOING THIS

03:13:18.754 --> 03:13:22.925 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY. AND.

03:13:21.423 --> 03:13:24.059 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING

03:13:22.925 --> 03:13:25.594 region:rollup2
TO GET PAID FOR ULTIMATELY

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:28.564 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE CREATING.

03:13:25.594 --> 03:13:29.998 region:rollup2
A PROCESS AND AND HANDING IT TO.

03:13:28.564 --> 03:13:31.033 region:rollup2
THE STATE AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S

03:13:29.998 --> 03:13:32.901 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE EXPECTED TO

03:13:31.033 --> 03:13:35.204 region:rollup2
SPEND MONEY TO TO GO SOLVE THE

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:36.805 region:rollup2
PROBLEM SO IT'S.

03:13:35.204 --> 03:13:39.241 region:rollup2
IT IT'S A BIT OF A PICKLE THAT

03:13:36.805 --> 03:13:40.776 region:rollup2

03:13:43.412 --> 03:13:45.747 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION OR

03:13:45.147 --> 03:13:50.185 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE

03:13:45.747 --> 03:13:50.752 region:rollup2

WHICH MICROPOLITAN POLLUTION

03:29:31.059 --> 03:29:34.996 region:rollup2
MIGHT AFFECT HUMANS WE DO

03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:36.898 region:rollup2
HOWEVER KNOW THAT MANY ANIMALS

FOUND IN FISH SAMPLES.

03:30:17.038 --> 03:30:20.408 region:rollup2
WE'RE MICROFIBER.

03:30:18.806 --> 03:30:21.809 region:rollup2
WELL ALL PLASTIC DEBRIS FOUND IN

THE SHELLFISH

03:30:21.809 --> 03:30:27.381 region:rollup2
SAMPLED WERE WITH MICROFIBER SO.

03:30:25.379 --> 03:30:29.517 region:rollup2
WERE MICROFIBER.

03:30:27.381 --> 03:30:31.252 region:rollup2

AND MICROPOLITAN FIBERS WERE

03:30:37.158 --> 03:30:41.429 region:rollup2
FOUND IN NEARLY EVERY SAMPLE.

03:30:39.393 --> 03:30:43.464 region:rollup2
THE SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT

03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:45.166 region:rollup2
NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE

CONTAIN PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS.

03:30:47.869 --> 03:30:51.939 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE ARE STARTING TO

03:30:49.971 --> 03:30:54.575 region:rollup2
FIND EVEN BOTTLED WATER

03:30:51.939 --> 03:30:57.111 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED WITH MICROFIBER IS.

03:30:54.575 --> 03:30:59.280 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE STUDIES THAT ARE.

03:30:57.111 --> 03:31:01.415 region:rollup2
.

03:30:59.280 --> 03:31:03.184 region:rollup2
OF BEING RELEASED ON A REGULAR

03:31:01.415 --> 03:31:05.052 region:rollup2
BASIS NOW THEY'RE SHOWING EVEN

BROADER RELEASES A PLASTIC MICRO

03:31:05.052 --> 03:31:08.556 region:rollup2
FIBERS BECAUSE WERE REALLY JUST

03:31:06.888 --> 03:31:10.057 region:rollup2
STARTING TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS

03:31:08.556 --> 03:31:16.497 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

03:31:10.057 --> 03:31:18.432 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE

03:31:16.497 --> 03:31:20.601 region:rollup2

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:21.869 region:rollup2
REAL SHOULD BEAR TWO LABELS ONE

03:31:20.601 --> 03:31:27.475 region:rollup2
THAT ADDS INFORMATION ON THE

03:31:21.869 --> 03:31:29.810 region:rollup2
EXISTING CARE LABEL AND A CAN.

03:31:27.475 --> 03:31:31.846 region:rollup2
BANK ACCOUNT OR ANOTHER LABEL

03:31:29.810 --> 03:31:32.680 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES INFORMATION

03:31:31.846 --> 03:31:34.615 region:rollup2
REGARDING.

03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:36.484 region:rollup2
HOW TO WASH AND HAVE CARE FOR

03:31:34.615 --> 03:31:38.352 region:rollup2
THESE PRODUCTS?

03:31:36.484 --> 03:31:40.021 region:rollup2
THE LABEL WILL NOT REQUIRE A

03:31:38.352 --> 03:31:42.089 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER TO INCLUDE ANY

03:31:40.021 --> 03:31:44.025 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE IN

03:31:42.089 --> 03:31:45.293 region:rollup2
CONFLICT WITH WHAT IS REQUIRED

03:31:44.025 --> 03:31:47.228 region:rollup2
BY FEDERAL LAW.

03:31:45.293 --> 03:31:50.198 region:rollup2
AND AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE

03:31:47.228 --> 03:31:52.633 region:rollup2
I SHOULD POINT OUT IS NOT A BAN.

03:31:50.198 --> 03:31:54.402 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMPLY AN IMPORTANT FIRST

03:31:52.633 --> 03:31:56.571 region:rollup2
STEP THAT HOLDS COUNTIES THE

03:31:54.402 --> 03:31:57.104 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

03:31:56.571 --> 03:31:58.573 region:rollup2
WASTE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS

03:31:57.104 --> 03:32:00.107 region:rollup2
CREATE.

03:31:58.573 --> 03:32:01.542 region:rollup2
THAT EDUCATES THE PUBLIC AND

03:32:00.107 --> 03:32:04.445 region:rollup2
THAT KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON

03:32:01.542 --> 03:32:06.180 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO FIND WHAT WE

03:32:04.445 --> 03:32:07.748 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE AND THAT IS A

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:09.684 region:rollup2
LASTING SOLUTION.

03:32:07.748 --> 03:32:12.019 region:rollup2
SO. THIS IS A PRAGMATIC APPROACH

03:32:09.684 --> 03:32:13.821 region:rollup2
TO TACKLING A COMPLICATED ISSUE.

03:32:12.019 --> 03:32:15.556 region:rollup2
AND I LEAVE YOU WITH THIS.

03:32:13.821 --> 03:32:16.090 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL

WORLD'S OCEANS.

03:32:23.497 --> 03:32:27.101 region:rollup2
ARE DUE TO THE WASHING OF

03:32:24.999 --> 03:32:29.337 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC TEXTILES.

03:32:27.101 --> 03:32:31.138 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WAIT TO BEGIN TO

03:32:29.337 --> 03:32:32.573 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT WILL ONLY

03:32:31.138 --> 03:32:34.208 region:rollup2
GET WORSE.

03:32:32.573 --> 03:32:35.643 region:rollup2
WE THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE WHERE

03:32:34.208 --> 03:32:37.645 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE POLLUTION

03:32:35.643 --> 03:32:39.180 region:rollup2
AT THE SOURCE.

03:32:37.645 --> 03:32:41.215 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE

03:32:39.180 --> 03:32:44.018 region:rollup2
EMPOWERS CONSUMER WITH THE

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:46.153 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO

03:32:44.018 --> 03:32:48.289 region:rollup2
HELP THEM TAKE RESPONSIBLE

03:32:46.153 --> 03:32:50.057 region:rollup2
ACTION AS INDIVIDUALS I HAVE

03:32:48.289 --> 03:32:52.360 region:rollup2
THREE WITNESSES WITH ME HERE. IN

03:32:50.057 --> 03:32:53.227 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL OF THEM

03:32:52.360 --> 03:32:54.295 region:rollup2
TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES.

03:32:53.227 --> 03:32:58.432 region:rollup2
AND I THANK YOU FOR

03:32:54.295 --> 03:32:59.567 region:rollup2
AND I VOTE.

03:32:58.432 --> 03:33:01.135 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MARTUCCI

EXTRACTION TO DISPOSAL.

03:33:14.582 --> 03:33:17.718 region:rollup2
THE MOVEMENT IS INCREASINGLY

03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:19.587 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF

03:33:17.718 --> 03:33:21.289 region:rollup2
MICRO PLASTIC POLLUTION

03:33:19.587 --> 03:33:23.024 region:rollup2
MICROFIBER IS ARE KNOWN TO BE

03:33:21.289 --> 03:33:23.524 region:rollup2
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

03:33:23.024 --> 03:33:24.892 region:rollup2
PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR

WATERWAYS.

03:33:24.892 --> 03:33:27.695 region:rollup2
THEY ARE IN THE FOOD WE EAT THE

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:29.563 region:rollup2
AIR WE BREATHE. AND ACROSS THE

03:33:27.695 --> 03:33:31.165 region:rollup2
GLOBE.

03:33:29.563 --> 03:33:32.933 region:rollup2
WE KNOW FROM STUDIES CONDUCTED

03:33:31.165 --> 03:33:35.002 region:rollup2
BY THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY ITSELF

03:33:32.933 --> 03:33:36.937 region:rollup2
THAT SYNTHETIC FIBERS SHAD

03:33:35.002 --> 03:33:37.738 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT MATERIALS INTO OUR

03:33:37.738 --> 03:33:41.876 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

03:33:40.174 --> 03:33:42.410 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROBLEM. THE MOVEMENT

03:33:41.876 --> 03:33:44.478 region:rollup2
FEELS VERY SIR UP STRONGLY

03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:46.113 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:33:44.478 --> 03:33:47.381 region:rollup2
CITIZENS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT

03:33:46.113 --> 03:33:48.683 region:rollup2
THE CLOTHING THEY BUY HAS THE

03:33:50.484 --> 03:33:54.155 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP IS KNOWLEDGE AB

03:33:52.620 --> 03:33:55.323 region:rollup2
TWO THREE SEVEN NINE DOES JUST

03:33:54.155 --> 03:33:57.224 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:33:55.323 --> 03:33:58.893 region:rollup2
SOME OF PROPOSED THAT WE FILTER

WASHING MACHINE AFFLUENT. THERE

03:33:58.893 --> 03:34:02.363 region:rollup2
ARE A HUNDRED IN THREE MILLION

03:34:00.861 --> 03:34:04.465 region:rollup2
WASHING MACHINES IN THE U. S.

03:34:02.363 --> 03:34:05.800 region:rollup2
THE SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.

03:34:04.465 --> 03:34:07.501 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION SHOULD NOT BE HOW

03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:09.804 region:rollup2
MUCH OR HOW LITTLE A GIVEN

03:34:07.501 --> 03:34:12.006 region:rollup2
FABRIC FLUTES IT SHOULD BE ABOUT

03:34:09.804 --> 03:34:14.041 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT.

03:34:12.006 --> 03:34:15.576 region:rollup2

MAJOR WASTE WATER TREATMENT

03:34:27.688 --> 03:34:30.825 region:rollup2
AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA HERE

03:34:29.290 --> 03:34:32.426 region:rollup2
TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY

THREE SEVENTY NINE.

03:34:32.426 --> 03:34:35.396 region:rollup2
A MICROFIBER AND MAKE A PLASTIC

03:34:33.728 --> 03:34:36.630 region:rollup2
POLLUTION IS A SUBJECT THAT'S

03:34:35.396 --> 03:34:38.032 region:rollup2
BEEN GENERATING.

03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:40.501 region:rollup2
SOME SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

03:34:38.032 --> 03:34:42.470 region:rollup2
INTEREST LATELY AND OUR MEMBERS

03:34:40.501 --> 03:34:43.804 region:rollup2
ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. AND

03:34:42.470 --> 03:34:45.372 region:rollup2
VARIOUS RESEARCH EFFORTS

03:34:43.804 --> 03:34:47.675 region:rollup2
RELATING TO MICRO PLASTICS HAVE

03:34:45.372 --> 03:34:48.542 region:rollup2
BEEN INDUCED INITIATED IN RECENT

03:34:47.675 --> 03:34:50.511 region:rollup2
YEARS INCLUDING.

03:34:48.542 --> 03:34:51.779 region:rollup2
SOME BEING DONE IN CONJUNCTION

03:34:50.511 --> 03:34:53.247 region:rollup2
WITH THE WASTE WATER COMMUNITY

03:34:51.779 --> 03:34:54.882 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

03:34:53.247 --> 03:34:56.250 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS FOR MICRO FIBERS TO

03:34:54.882 --> 03:34:57.952 region:rollup2
ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

03:34:56.250 --> 03:35:00.755 region:rollup2
WASHING MACHINE AFFLUENT IS.

03:34:57.952 --> 03:35:02.690 region:rollup2
A CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE SOURCE.

03:35:00.755 --> 03:35:04.425 region:rollup2
OF TREATMENT PLANTS ARE JUST NOT

03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:07.495 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ABLE TO FILTER OUT MICRO

03:35:04.425 --> 03:35:09.563 region:rollup2
FIBERS AND IN CASES WHERE. THEY

03:35:07.495 --> 03:35:11.465 region:rollup2
CAN FILTER FOR MICRO FIBERS AND

03:35:09.563 --> 03:35:12.900 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY ARE JUST BEING

03:35:11.465 --> 03:35:13.534 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED TO ADDRESS A

03:35:12.900 --> 03:35:15.069 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WASTE STREAM THOUGH

03:35:13.534 --> 03:35:16.670 region:rollup2
THEY STILL TIMIDLY AND UP IN THE

03:35:15.069 --> 03:35:18.606 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. SO FOR THESE

03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:19.206 region:rollup2
REASONS AND WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY

03:35:18.606 --> 03:35:20.341 region:rollup2
ADVOCATING FOR SOURCE CONTROL

03:35:19.206 --> 03:35:21.642 region:rollup2
AS.

03:35:20.341 --> 03:35:21.842 region:rollup2
THE BEST SOLUTION FOR DEALING

03:35:21.642 --> 03:35:23.644 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:35:21.842 --> 03:35:25.212 region:rollup2
MAKER PLASTIC POLLUTION AND WE

03:35:23.644 --> 03:35:27.314 region:rollup2
THINK AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY

03:35:25.212 --> 03:35:29.150 region:rollup2
NINE PROMOTE SOURCE CONTROL AND

03:35:27.314 --> 03:35:30.985 region:rollup2
CONSUMER AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE.

03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:35.289 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD

03:35:30.985 --> 03:35:36.490 region:rollup2
URGE YOUR ABOUT.

EXTREMELY CONCERNED WITH PLASTIC

03:35:50.871 --> 03:35:55.242 region:rollup2
CENTER IN ARENA OUR ENVIRONMENT

03:35:52.606 --> 03:35:57.178 region:rollup2
AND WE. THINK THE CORRECT

03:35:55.242 --> 03:35:58.479 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS IS TO CONTROL

03:35:57.178 --> 03:35:59.046 region:rollup2
IT AT THAT SOURCE.

03:35:58.479 --> 03:36:01.849 region:rollup2

OVER THAT SEE IN THE LENT

03:36:12.193 --> 03:36:16.230 region:rollup2
TRAPPED IN YOUR DRYER. SO THAT'S

03:36:14.161 --> 03:36:17.698 region:rollup2
AN INDICATION OF THE AMOUNT OF.

03:36:16.230 --> 03:36:19.934 region:rollup2
FIBERS THAT ARE GETTING OUT INTO

03:36:17.698 --> 03:36:21.969 region:rollup2

THIS ISSUE MANY. FOLKS ARE NOT

03:36:28.075 --> 03:36:31.679 region:rollup2
AWARE OF THE ISSUE OF LE MICRO

03:36:29.276 --> 03:36:33.647 region:rollup2
FIBERS AND THAT IT'S GETTING

03:36:31.679 --> 03:36:35.983 region:rollup2
INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S

03:36:33.647 --> 03:36:38.586 region:rollup2

IDENTIFIED BASICALLY JUST

03:36:45.860 --> 03:36:51.599 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE SO WE WOULD

APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONCERN.

03:38:56.657 --> 03:39:00.060 region:rollup2
AND THE ATTENTION HE'S

03:38:57.858 --> 03:39:02.763 region:rollup2
PROPOSITIONS. WE DON'T SEE

03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:05.099 region:rollup2
MANDATORY HANDWASHING LABELS AS

03:39:02.763 --> 03:39:06.700 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FIRST

03:39:05.099 --> 03:39:09.436 region:rollup2
AND FOREMOST WE THINK THAT

03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:09.770 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WILL LARGELY IGNORED

03:39:09.436 --> 03:39:11.438 region:rollup2
THIS ADVICE.

03:39:09.770 --> 03:39:13.173 region:rollup2
BUSY WORKING FAMILIES ARE NOT

03:39:11.438 --> 03:39:14.875 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE THE TIME TO HAND

03:39:17.244 --> 03:39:20.948 region:rollup2
THEIR UNIFORMS THAT THEY NEED

03:39:19.246 --> 03:39:22.516 region:rollup2

MEDICAL ENVIRONMENT OR SOME

03:39:22.516 --> 03:39:26.587 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACE WE JUST DON'T THINK

03:39:24.418 --> 03:39:27.421 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REALISTIC SOLUTION. OF

03:39:26.587 --> 03:39:28.822 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE JUST SPENT A FEW

03:39:27.421 --> 03:39:29.823 region:rollup2
MINUTES DISCUSSING AN ODOR

03:39:28.822 --> 03:39:31.959 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE THINK THIS MIGHT

03:39:29.823 --> 03:39:32.526 region:rollup2
CREATE ANOTHER ODOR PROBLEM IF

03:39:31.959 --> 03:39:34.094 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WERE ACTUALLY HAND

03:39:32.526 --> 03:39:35.596 region:rollup2
WASHING.

03:39:34.094 --> 03:39:36.964 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT.

03:39:35.596 --> 03:39:38.532 region:rollup2
FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL

03:39:36.964 --> 03:39:40.300 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE HE AND WASHING

03:39:38.532 --> 03:39:41.869 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY UTILIZES MORE WATER AND

03:39:40.300 --> 03:39:43.370 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS COMMITTEE SPENDS

03:39:41.869 --> 03:39:45.639 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIME ENERGY AND EFFORT

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:47.341 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THE NEED TO PRESERVE

03:39:45.639 --> 03:39:49.510 region:rollup2
WATER AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

03:39:47.341 --> 03:39:51.445 region:rollup2
ISSUE TO. MANY PARTS OF THE

03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:52.680 region:rollup2
STATE SO WE DON'T THINK IT'S

03:39:51.445 --> 03:39:53.881 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FOR THAT

03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:55.349 region:rollup2
REASON ALSO.

03:39:53.881 --> 03:39:56.784 region:rollup2
I CALIFORNIA OVER ONLY LABEL

03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:58.318 region:rollup2
WILL DEFINITELY INCREASE COSTS

03:39:56.784 --> 03:40:00.587 region:rollup2
FOR MANUFACTURING.

03:39:58.318 --> 03:40:02.723 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE TO DO A

03:40:00.587 --> 03:40:04.324 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC LABEL ON

03:40:02.723 --> 03:40:06.527 region:rollup2
THAT IN TURN WILL INCREASE THE

03:40:04.324 --> 03:40:07.795 region:rollup2
COST FOR FOR RETAILERS AND FOR

03:40:06.527 --> 03:40:09.430 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WHO OFTEN CHOOSE

03:40:07.795 --> 03:40:11.865 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY

03:40:09.430 --> 03:40:13.834 region:rollup2
ARE LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN WOOL

03:40:11.865 --> 03:40:15.602 region:rollup2
SILK OR COTTON AND THE CARE IS

03:40:13.834 --> 03:40:16.703 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EASIER TO RETHINK

03:40:15.602 --> 03:40:18.972 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER BURDEN ON

03:40:16.703 --> 03:40:20.541 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS THAT THIS BILL PLACES.

03:40:18.972 --> 03:40:22.242 region:rollup2
FINALLY WE THINK THIS BILL IS

03:40:20.541 --> 03:40:24.311 region:rollup2
PREMATURE THE AUTHOR DID STATE

03:40:22.242 --> 03:40:26.313 region:rollup2
ONE STUDY FROM THE BURNS SCHOOL

03:40:24.311 --> 03:40:29.583 region:rollup2
OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AT YOU

03:40:26.313 --> 03:40:31.752 region:rollup2
SEE S. B. BUT WE ALSO KNOW OF

03:40:29.583 --> 03:40:33.554 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND THE. DAY THAT BROWN

03:40:33.554 --> 03:40:37.791 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED A MICROFIBER

03:40:34.888 --> 03:40:39.493 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP SUMMIT LAST OCTOBER

03:40:37.791 --> 03:40:42.529 region:rollup2
THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE

03:40:39.493 --> 03:40:43.864 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF. KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN

03:40:42.529 --> 03:40:45.132 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

03:40:43.864 --> 03:40:46.834 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REAL SOURCES OF

03:40:45.132 --> 03:40:48.702 region:rollup2
MICROFIBER POLLUTION ARE THEY

03:40:46.834 --> 03:40:50.738 region:rollup2
POINTED TO TOILETRIES WHICH IS

03:40:48.702 --> 03:40:51.638 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS. ADDRESSED TO SOME

03:40:50.738 --> 03:40:53.674 region:rollup2
EXTENT.

03:40:51.638 --> 03:40:55.242 region:rollup2
UPHOLSTERY CARPETING AND OTHER

03:40:53.674 --> 03:40:57.211 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTORS AS PART OF THE

03:40:55.242 --> 03:40:59.713 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND THEY ALSO IDENTIFIED

03:40:57.211 --> 03:41:00.814 region:rollup2
THAT THE SOLUTION. IS NOT KNOWN

03:40:59.713 --> 03:41:03.083 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME BUT THEY'RE WORKING

03:41:00.814 --> 03:41:04.952 region:rollup2
ON IDENTIFYING THE SOLUTION AND

03:41:03.083 --> 03:41:06.720 region:rollup2
MAKING SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:41:04.952 --> 03:41:08.088 region:rollup2
SO WE CURRENTLY DON'T THINK THAT

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:09.256 region:rollup2
HAND WASHING IS THE APPROPRIATE

03:41:08.088 --> 03:41:11.592 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AND.

03:41:09.256 --> 03:41:12.259 region:rollup2
THE LABELING PUTS A GREAT DEAL

03:41:11.592 --> 03:41:13.894 region:rollup2
OF BURDEN.

03:41:12.259 --> 03:41:15.262 region:rollup2
AND LIABILITY ON CALIFORNIA

03:41:13.894 --> 03:41:19.366 region:rollup2
RETAILER SO FOR THAT REASON WE

03:41:15.262 --> 03:41:20.267 region:rollup2
MUST OPPOSE.

03:41:19.366 --> 03:41:22.336 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING US

03:41:20.267 --> 03:41:24.271 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON

03:41:22.336 --> 03:41:25.339 region:rollup2

WE'RE A TRADE ASSOCIATION

03:41:30.210 --> 03:41:32.913 region:rollup2

03:41:34.248 --> 03:41:37.050 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS

03:41:35.582 --> 03:41:38.552 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS AND I JUST WANNA ADD

03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:40.354 region:rollup2
ON LABELING AS A SOLUTION.

03:41:38.552 --> 03:41:41.789 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES CURRENTLY ENGAGING

03:41:40.354 --> 03:41:42.890 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE AND.

03:41:41.789 --> 03:41:44.291 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT

03:41:42.890 --> 03:41:46.827 region:rollup2
MICROFIBER POLLUTION.

03:41:44.291 --> 03:41:48.595 region:rollup2
DOES EXIST AND IS AN ISSUE IN

03:41:46.827 --> 03:41:50.864 region:rollup2
THIS COMMUNITY BUT WE. WANT TO

03:41:48.595 --> 03:41:52.199 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO LABELING. IS NOT THE

03:41:50.864 --> 03:41:53.934 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IN THIS CASE.

03:41:52.199 --> 03:41:55.402 region:rollup2
GARMENTS CONVEY AN EXTENSIVE

03:41:53.934 --> 03:41:56.803 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ALREADY

03:41:55.402 --> 03:41:58.872 region:rollup2
PER FEDERAL LAW.

03:41:56.803 --> 03:42:00.574 region:rollup2
ON FIBER CONTENT CARE

AND NUMBER OF OTHER PIECES OF

03:42:02.176 --> 03:42:05.679 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO. FURTHER LABELING

03:42:03.977 --> 03:42:06.313 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE IS IT'S JUST

03:42:05.679 --> 03:42:07.781 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT.

03:42:06.313 --> 03:42:08.816 region:rollup2
AND REALLY WOULD BE LOST IN THE

03:42:07.781 --> 03:42:10.951 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT IT'S ALREADY

03:42:08.816 --> 03:42:12.319 region:rollup2
MANDATED ON THOSE LABELS SO AT

03:42:10.951 --> 03:42:13.654 region:rollup2
BEST CONSUMERS WOULD SIMPLY

03:42:12.319 --> 03:42:15.222 region:rollup2
IGNORE THE INFORMATION ON THE

03:42:13.654 --> 03:42:16.757 region:rollup2
LABEL AND AT WORST IT WOULD

03:42:15.222 --> 03:42:18.358 region:rollup2
CAUSE CONFUSION OR HARM IF

03:42:16.757 --> 03:42:20.360 region:rollup2

03:42:20.360 --> 03:42:22.996 region:rollup2
DAMAGED THEIR. CLOTHING.

03:42:21.094 --> 03:42:24.598 region:rollup2
MOREOVER BECAUSE FEDERAL CARE

03:42:22.996 --> 03:42:26.667 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIONS EXPLICITLY REQUIRE

03:42:24.598 --> 03:42:27.568 region:rollup2
THE PROVISION OF THE BEST METHOD

03:42:26.667 --> 03:42:29.369 region:rollup2
OF REFERS BANISHMENT OF A

THE GOVERNMENT A STATE BASED

03:42:30.804 --> 03:42:34.107 region:rollup2
CARE INSTRUCTION THAT LED TO

03:42:31.905 --> 03:42:36.009 region:rollup2
THIS OUTCOME. WOULD CONFLICT

03:42:34.107 --> 03:42:36.844 region:rollup2
WITH FEDERAL LAW AND FILL ON

03:42:36.009 --> 03:42:38.078 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PREEMPTION GROUNDS

03:42:36.844 --> 03:42:39.213 region:rollup2
SO ADDITIONALLY WITHOUT

03:42:38.078 --> 03:42:40.647 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

SIMILAR REGULATORY OUTCOME.

03:42:46.019 --> 03:42:49.556 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND

03:42:47.955 --> 03:42:50.991 region:rollup2
AN ABSENCE OF THIS DATA THE

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:56.196 region:rollup2
MANDATED LABELING ALMOST SURELY

03:42:50.991 --> 03:42:57.431 region:rollup2
FAILS THEM COMPELLED SPEECH.

03:42:56.196 --> 03:42:58.398 region:rollup2

03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:06.306 region:rollup2
REGRETFULLY OPPOSITION TO AB

03:43:04.705 --> 03:43:08.909 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE.

03:43:06.306 --> 03:43:09.476 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY I SEEM CA REALLY

03:43:08.909 --> 03:43:11.378 region:rollup2
CLEARLY.

03:43:09.476 --> 03:43:13.480 region:rollup2
NOTES THAT THE REAL QUESTION IS

03:43:11.378 --> 03:43:15.215 region:rollup2
WHETHER REQUIRING A LABEL ON THE

03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:17.451 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC FABRICS I AM

03:43:15.215 --> 03:43:18.919 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY IS A REASONABLE AND

03:43:17.451 --> 03:43:20.721 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING

03:43:18.919 --> 03:43:22.256 region:rollup2
MICROFIBER IS ENTERING. INTO

03:43:20.721 --> 03:43:23.991 region:rollup2
AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT AND WHETHER

03:43:22.256 --> 03:43:26.093 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WILL OF ACTUALLY ABIDE

03:43:23.991 --> 03:43:27.828 region:rollup2
BY LABELS TO THAT AND.

03:43:26.093 --> 03:43:29.363 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THE CONVENIENCE

03:43:27.828 --> 03:43:32.432 region:rollup2
FACTOR THAT MANY CONSUMERS ARE

03:43:29.363 --> 03:43:32.733 region:rollup2
REALLY FAST FOCUSED ON FOR THEIR

03:43:32.432 --> 03:43:34.968 region:rollup2
BUSY LIVES.

03:43:32.733 --> 03:43:36.103 region:rollup2

SYNTHETIC OR NATIONAL TO SHED IN

03:43:36.103 --> 03:43:39.239 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL AND THE APPROACH

03:43:38.105 --> 03:43:41.008 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING MICRO FIBERS IN

03:43:39.239 --> 03:43:42.843 region:rollup2

03:43:42.843 --> 03:43:47.047 region:rollup2
IS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRADE OFFS AS

03:43:44.945 --> 03:43:48.048 region:rollup2
WAS MENTIONED BY MY PRIOR I'D HA

03:43:47.047 --> 03:43:50.250 region:rollup2
OPPONENT COLLEAGUES RELATIVE TO

HAND WASHING. NOT SPECIFICALLY

03:43:50.250 --> 03:43:54.321 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING MICRO FIBERS IN LAW

03:43:53.086 --> 03:43:56.089 region:rollup2
THE WATERWAYS NOT TO MENTION

03:43:54.321 --> 03:43:58.525 region:rollup2
ABOUT TIED THE ISSUES AROUND

03:43:56.089 --> 03:43:59.559 region:rollup2
WATER EFFICIENCY AND THE FACT

03:43:58.525 --> 03:44:00.861 region:rollup2
THAT MACHINE WASHING IS ACTUALLY

03:43:59.559 --> 03:44:03.397 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WHEN IT

03:44:00.861 --> 03:44:05.232 region:rollup2
COMES TO. A WASHINGTON ARTICLES

03:44:03.397 --> 03:44:07.501 region:rollup2
OF CLOTHING FOR WATER I HAD

03:44:07.501 --> 03:44:11.204 region:rollup2
WAS NOTED BRIEFLY AYE RELATIVE

03:44:09.436 --> 03:44:12.306 region:rollup2
TO CONCERNS ABOUT. A

ARE MADE A VERY DURABLE

03:44:17.778 --> 03:44:21.348 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THE

03:44:19.913 --> 03:44:24.751 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER HAND

03:44:24.751 --> 03:44:34.227 region:rollup2
THOSE AYE SOILED AYE INCOME AND

03:44:30.757 --> 03:44:37.597 region:rollup2
ARE PIECES OF FABRIC FURTHER FOR

MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHETHER

03:44:37.597 --> 03:44:42.769 region:rollup2
THAT SUFFICIENT IN HAND WASHING

ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AS WELL IN

03:44:45.605 --> 03:44:47.507 region:rollup2
THOSE ENVIRONMENTS.

03:44:46.673 --> 03:44:48.175 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IN IN THE INTEREST

03:44:47.507 --> 03:44:49.977 region:rollup2
OF SUSTAINABILITY AND CRADLE TO

03:44:48.175 --> 03:44:50.477 region:rollup2
CRADLE PRACTICES MANY CLOTHING

UTILIZING MORE AND MORE RECYCLED

CLOSING CLOTHING MANUFACTURING.

03:44:53.313 --> 03:44:54.548 region:rollup2
SUCH EFFORTS FROM C. MTA'S

03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:55.515 region:rollup2

MANUFACTURES THAT WE BELIEVE

03:45:00.487 --> 03:45:02.889 region:rollup2
WILL NOT SERVE THE INTENDED AND

AND.

03:45:02.889 --> 03:45:06.093 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THE BILL SO FOR

THESE REASONS UNFORTUNATELY WE

03:45:06.093 --> 03:45:09.196 region:rollup2
DO OPPOSE AB TWENTY THREE

SEVENTY NINE I REALLY WOULD

03:45:09.196 --> 03:45:11.732 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE US SO I TO TAKE

03:45:10.397 --> 03:45:13.500 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEW

03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:17.170 region:rollup2
OTHER WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE

03:45:14.835 --> 03:45:18.372 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND AND HELP US GET US

03:45:17.170 --> 03:45:19.206 region:rollup2
FURTHER ALONG IN TERMS OF

SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO GOT

03:46:12.526 --> 03:46:14.795 region:rollup2
HERE IN THIS THIS NEW CLASS OF

03:46:13.593 --> 03:46:15.829 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND IF

03:46:14.795 --> 03:46:18.365 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONE THING WE'VE SEEN A

03:46:15.829 --> 03:46:18.965 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIMES IT'S THINGS ON

03:46:18.365 --> 03:46:20.667 region:rollup2
SCOPE. AND THINGS ON LABELING

03:46:18.965 --> 03:46:22.803 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY.

03:46:20.667 --> 03:46:23.904 region:rollup2
I THINK ARTIE SHAW I WON'T BE

03:46:22.803 --> 03:46:25.272 region:rollup2
ABLE SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY FOR

03:46:23.904 --> 03:46:26.573 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THOSE VERY RECENT

03:46:25.272 --> 03:46:28.375 region:rollup2
ONE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT

03:46:26.573 --> 03:46:28.942 region:rollup2
THE DATA YET. I THINK IS A LOT

03:46:28.375 --> 03:46:29.976 region:rollup2
OF THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

03:46:28.942 --> 03:46:31.845 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:46:29.976 --> 03:46:33.246 region:rollup2
I REPRESENT WITH A VERY POOR

03:46:31.845 --> 03:46:36.316 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN

03:46:33.246 --> 03:46:36.983 region:rollup2
AFFORD. PURE SILK PURE COTTON OR

03:46:36.316 --> 03:46:38.285 region:rollup2
PURE.

03:46:36.983 --> 03:46:39.986 region:rollup2
WALL ME SO THAT'S AN ISSUE. SO

03:46:38.285 --> 03:46:41.621 region:rollup2
THEM WERE ALSO TELLING PEOPLE IS

03:46:39.986 --> 03:46:42.956 region:rollup2
WHAT WE PUT ON THE LABELS

03:46:41.621 --> 03:46:45.992 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE

03:46:42.956 --> 03:46:47.394 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WE VERY. VERY CAREFUL

03:46:45.992 --> 03:46:49.095 region:rollup2
BUT WE PUT ON LABELS AND WHEN WE

03:46:47.394 --> 03:46:50.063 region:rollup2
PUT SOMETHING ON LABELS. WE'RE

03:46:49.095 --> 03:46:51.164 region:rollup2
BASICALLY TELLING PEOPLE TO HAND

03:46:50.063 --> 03:46:52.699 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING AND WE KNOW THEY'RE

03:46:51.164 --> 03:46:54.534 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE

03:46:52.699 --> 03:46:55.502 region:rollup2
SOMEDAY WITH BY PIDS. IS NED

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:57.871 region:rollup2
POTTER DOESN'T HAVE THE SPACE TO

03:46:55.502 --> 03:46:58.138 region:rollup2
BUILD A HAND WASH EVERYBODY'S

03:46:57.871 --> 03:46:59.005 region:rollup2
CLOTHES.

03:46:58.138 --> 03:46:59.539 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T KNOW IF

03:46:59.005 --> 03:47:00.707 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE

03:46:59.539 --> 03:47:02.375 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE.

03:47:00.707 --> 03:47:03.944 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY ASSEMBLY WHO

03:47:02.375 --> 03:47:05.745 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS THE DELTA AREA AND AS

03:47:03.944 --> 03:47:07.080 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH NOT

03:47:05.745 --> 03:47:08.548 region:rollup2
HAVING ENOUGH WATER.

03:47:07.080 --> 03:47:10.183 region:rollup2
AND UC SANTA BARBARA STUDY

03:47:08.548 --> 03:47:11.985 region:rollup2
CLEARLY SAYS WASHING THINGS BY

03:47:10.183 --> 03:47:14.187 region:rollup2
HAND TAKES A LOT MORE WATER THAN

03:47:11.985 --> 03:47:14.788 region:rollup2
THE WASHING MACHINES SO I THINK

03:47:14.187 --> 03:47:15.956 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING REALLY

03:47:14.788 --> 03:47:17.324 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

03:47:15.956 --> 03:47:18.558 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT

03:47:17.324 --> 03:47:20.794 region:rollup2
WHITE BOY I DON'T THINK I KNOW

03:47:18.558 --> 03:47:21.761 region:rollup2
I'M NOT THERE YET. TOM KNOWS WE

03:47:20.794 --> 03:47:23.530 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO

03:47:21.761 --> 03:47:25.699 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU

03:47:23.530 --> 03:47:28.034 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH THANK YOU.

03:47:25.699 --> 03:47:29.703 region:rollup2
NEAR THERE A.

03:47:28.034 --> 03:47:30.971 region:rollup2
COMMENTS MUSLIM THANK YOU. I

03:47:29.703 --> 03:47:33.540 region:rollup2
THINK YOU I THINK THIS IS AN

03:47:30.971 --> 03:47:35.041 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I TOO

03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:35.609 region:rollup2
AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BRAND

03:47:35.041 --> 03:47:36.243 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ON THE WORK THAT THE

03:47:35.609 --> 03:47:38.245 region:rollup2
DEAL.

03:47:36.243 --> 03:47:40.547 region:rollup2
AND AND A LITTLE SLIGHTLY TRUST

03:47:38.245 --> 03:47:41.815 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WASH A LOT OF THINGS

03:47:40.547 --> 03:47:43.517 region:rollup2
AND HAND WASH.

03:47:41.815 --> 03:47:45.218 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LABEL SAYS TO AND

03:47:43.517 --> 03:47:47.420 region:rollup2
SO I PAY ATTENTION TO THE LABEL.

03:47:45.218 --> 03:47:49.055 region:rollup2
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND

03:47:47.420 --> 03:47:51.958 region:rollup2
I THINK MY CONCERN IS THE IS THE

03:47:49.055 --> 03:47:53.793 region:rollup2
LONG TERM. AND THE A OF AND

03:47:51.958 --> 03:47:56.963 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT AS WATER

03:47:53.793 --> 03:47:58.365 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT THAT TOO. AT WASH

03:47:56.963 --> 03:47:59.232 region:rollup2
THINGS BY HAND BUT I DO THINK

03:47:58.365 --> 03:48:00.967 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

03:47:59.232 --> 03:48:01.167 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT

03:48:00.967 --> 03:48:02.936 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:48:01.167 --> 03:48:04.704 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

03:48:02.936 --> 03:48:07.040 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS

03:48:04.704 --> 03:48:09.576 region:rollup2
MEANS FOR OUR WATER SOURCES.

03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:10.143 region:rollup2
AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO S.

03:48:09.576 --> 03:48:11.545 region:rollup2
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

03:48:10.143 --> 03:48:12.212 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:48:11.545 --> 03:48:13.847 region:rollup2
I AGES.

THE BRANDS REPORT AND STUDY IS

03:48:16.082 --> 03:48:20.086 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I IS. INTERESTING

03:48:19.219 --> 03:48:21.354 region:rollup2

03:48:20.086 --> 03:48:23.356 region:rollup2
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU AND I'M

03:48:21.354 --> 03:48:23.957 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GRAPPLE BETWEEN THE

03:48:23.356 --> 03:48:24.858 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION OF DOING WHAT'S

03:48:23.957 --> 03:48:25.926 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

03:48:24.858 --> 03:48:28.461 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ONE

03:48:37.003 --> 03:48:41.741 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE THAT WE SEE RIGHT

03:48:40.807 --> 03:48:43.143 region:rollup2
NOW. IS NOT.

03:48:41.741 --> 03:48:44.744 region:rollup2
IT HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF I'M.

03:48:43.143 --> 03:48:46.079 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE NEED LIKE TO SEE

03:48:46.079 --> 03:48:46.846 region:rollup2

VERY LOW WATER USAGE

03:49:59.085 --> 03:50:02.222 region:rollup2
WHAT TOP LOADING WASHING MACHINE

03:50:00.854 --> 03:50:03.556 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT USES LIKE THIS MUCH

03:50:02.222 --> 03:50:04.791 region:rollup2

I WONDER FREELY CONFUSE A LOT OF

03:50:17.003 --> 03:50:19.239 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH NO HAND WASH ONLY

03:50:18.238 --> 03:50:20.440 region:rollup2

IT THE BEING THAT PRACTICAL

03:50:23.777 --> 03:50:27.447 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS.

03:50:26.613 --> 03:50:29.082 region:rollup2
THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF THINGS IS

03:50:27.447 --> 03:50:30.984 region:rollup2
IS IT GONNA RUN AFOUL OF FEDERAL

03:50:29.082 --> 03:50:32.585 region:rollup2
LAW AND I AND I REALLY AM

03:50:30.984 --> 03:50:33.620 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH IT LIVING IN AN

03:50:32.585 --> 03:50:34.254 region:rollup2
AREA AS WE DO IT SOUTHERN

03:50:33.620 --> 03:50:44.130 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. THE WATER EVEN IF WE

03:50:34.254 --> 03:50:46.766 region:rollup2
DID IT.

03:50:44.130 --> 03:50:49.669 region:rollup2
I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED

03:50:46.766 --> 03:50:54.674 region:rollup2

ON.

04:14:43.468 --> 04:14:47.339 region:rollup2
THE WHETHER IT'S A CARBONATED

04:14:45.337 --> 04:14:49.107 region:rollup2
BOTTLED HOT SO CALLED FILL OUR

04:14:47.339 --> 04:14:50.809 region:rollup2
WATER THERE ARE DIFFERENT.

04:14:49.107 --> 04:14:52.043 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE

04:14:50.809 --> 04:14:53.345 region:rollup2
IN FACT MOST THE BY THE

04:14:52.043 --> 04:14:55.147 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WE'VE TALKED TO

04:14:53.345 --> 04:14:56.748 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THEY AREN'T MOVING

04:14:55.147 --> 04:14:58.216 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS

04:14:56.748 --> 04:14:59.651 region:rollup2
AND IN LOOKING AT. THE VARIOUS

04:14:58.216 --> 04:15:01.219 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT

04:14:59.651 --> 04:15:03.088 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES WHERE THESE BOTTLES ARE

04:15:01.219 --> 04:15:03.622 region:rollup2
ALREADY OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE.

04:15:03.088 --> 04:15:05.290 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A

04:15:03.622 --> 04:15:06.925 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH THE BOTTLING

04:15:05.290 --> 04:15:09.761 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY. AND SEE IF THERE ARE

04:15:06.925 --> 04:15:11.963 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP FACILITATE

04:15:09.761 --> 04:15:13.832 region:rollup2
AND PUSH THEM. TO.

04:15:11.963 --> 04:15:16.468 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE CAPS COME BACK

04:15:13.832 --> 04:15:17.903 region:rollup2
WITH THE BOTTLES THEMSELVES AND

04:15:16.468 --> 04:15:20.205 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH.

04:15:17.903 --> 04:15:22.040 region:rollup2
PULL TABS ON ALUMINUM CANS THAT

04:15:20.205 --> 04:15:24.976 region:rollup2
WAS LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT THAT

04:15:22.040 --> 04:15:26.278 region:rollup2
PUSHED THAT CHANGE SO THAT THERE

04:15:24.976 --> 04:15:28.113 region:rollup2
WASN'T THAT LITTLE BIT OF.

04:15:26.278 --> 04:15:28.780 region:rollup2
ALUMINUM THAT WAS PRETTY PRETTY

04:15:28.113 --> 04:15:31.149 region:rollup2
PERVASIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THE

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:32.317 region:rollup2
TIME NOW THEY MOSTLY COME BACK

04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:34.786 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

04:15:32.317 --> 04:15:36.855 region:rollup2
FOR AND I HAVEN'T.

04:15:34.786 --> 04:15:37.556 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO.

04:15:36.855 --> 04:15:40.225 region:rollup2
NOW YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN

04:15:37.556 --> 04:15:41.193 region:rollup2
SUPPORT COMMITTEES.

04:15:40.225 --> 04:15:43.028 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHAIR MERITS TO CARRY

04:15:41.193 --> 04:15:43.962 region:rollup2
ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY

04:15:43.028 --> 04:15:45.764 region:rollup2
NAME IS CRAIG CADWALLADER AND

04:15:43.962 --> 04:15:47.666 region:rollup2
I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

04:15:45.764 --> 04:15:48.600 region:rollup2
SURFRIDER IN APPROXIMATELY

04:15:47.666 --> 04:15:50.202 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF MARINE

04:15:48.600 --> 04:15:51.770 region:rollup2
PLASTICS COME FROM TRASH IN

04:15:50.202 --> 04:15:53.672 region:rollup2
URBAN RUNOFF AND IF WE DON'T

04:15:51.770 --> 04:15:55.574 region:rollup2
REDUCE PLASTICS ENTERING THE

04:15:53.672 --> 04:15:58.009 region:rollup2
OCEAN. THEY'LL BE MORE PLASTIC

04:15:55.574 --> 04:15:59.211 region:rollup2
THAN TISH IN THE OCEAN BY TWENTY

04:15:58.009 --> 04:16:00.512 region:rollup2
FIFTY.

04:15:59.211 --> 04:16:02.147 region:rollup2
BOTTLE CAPS ARE THE THIRD MOST

04:16:00.512 --> 04:16:04.082 region:rollup2
COMMON ITEM FOUND ON THE BEACH

04:16:02.147 --> 04:16:05.483 region:rollup2
IS WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE

04:16:04.082 --> 04:16:06.985 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL COASTAL CLEANUP

04:16:05.483 --> 04:16:08.787 region:rollup2
DATE DATA.

04:16:06.985 --> 04:16:10.922 region:rollup2
THEY ARE A COMMON FORM OF ST

04:16:08.787 --> 04:16:12.190 region:rollup2
LITTER POLLUTING OUR COMMUNITIES

04:16:10.922 --> 04:16:14.893 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN

04:16:12.190 --> 04:16:16.728 region:rollup2
HEALTH IMPACTS ARE WIDE RANGING.

04:16:14.893 --> 04:16:19.397 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF SEA BIRDS HAVE

04:16:16.728 --> 04:16:20.665 region:rollup2
INGESTED PLASTICS MANY DIE OF

04:16:19.397 --> 04:16:23.134 region:rollup2
STARVATION WAS STOMACHS FULL OF

04:16:20.665 --> 04:16:24.402 region:rollup2
PLASTIC CAPS AND OTHER PLASTICS

04:16:23.134 --> 04:16:25.904 region:rollup2
MISTAKE PER FOOD.

04:16:24.402 --> 04:16:28.173 region:rollup2
NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED MARINE

04:16:25.904 --> 04:16:29.474 region:rollup2
SPECIES ARE IMPACTED.

04:16:28.173 --> 04:16:31.042 region:rollup2
YEAH PLASTICS BREAKDOWN INTO

04:16:29.474 --> 04:16:33.278 region:rollup2
MICRO PLASTICS IN THE MARINE

04:16:31.042 --> 04:16:35.046 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO ACCUMULATE

04:16:33.278 --> 04:16:36.581 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS FROM SEA WATER.

04:16:35.046 --> 04:16:38.783 region:rollup2
MICRO PLASTICS ARE PRESENT IN

04:16:36.581 --> 04:16:40.819 region:rollup2
OUR SEAFOOD SALT HONEY BEAR AND

04:16:38.783 --> 04:16:42.053 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER RECENT RESEARCH

04:16:40.819 --> 04:16:43.521 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO EAT

04:16:42.053 --> 04:16:45.023 region:rollup2
SHELLFISH RATE REALLY CAN BE

04:16:43.521 --> 04:16:47.092 region:rollup2
EATING UP TO ELEVEN THOUSAND

04:16:45.023 --> 04:16:48.093 region:rollup2
PIECES. OF MICRO PLASTIC PER

04:16:47.092 --> 04:16:49.594 region:rollup2
YEAR.

04:16:48.093 --> 04:16:51.129 region:rollup2
CONNECTING THE CAPS IS ONE

04:16:49.594 --> 04:16:53.098 region:rollup2
SIMPLE WAY TO DECREASE PLASTIC

04:16:51.129 --> 04:16:54.833 region:rollup2
POLLUTION RECENT RESEARCH FOUND

04:16:53.098 --> 04:16:56.501 region:rollup2
THAT U. S. ON AUSTRALIAN STATES

04:16:54.833 --> 04:16:58.136 region:rollup2
WITH BOTTLE DEPOSITS.

04:16:56.501 --> 04:16:59.938 region:rollup2
THIS CHARGE SIXTY PERCENT FEWER

04:16:58.136 --> 04:17:01.706 region:rollup2
PLASTIC BOTTLES TO COASTAL

04:16:59.938 --> 04:17:03.408 region:rollup2
WATERS THAN NON BOTTLE DEPOSIT

04:17:01.706 --> 04:17:04.843 region:rollup2
STATES YET THE CAPS WERE

04:17:03.408 --> 04:17:06.912 region:rollup2
CONNECTED THERE WOULD BE LESS

04:17:04.843 --> 04:17:08.680 region:rollup2
CAP POLLUTION. COMING FROM

04:17:06.912 --> 04:17:10.916 region:rollup2
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA IN THE

04:17:08.680 --> 04:17:11.783 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE BEVERAGE

04:17:10.916 --> 04:17:13.785 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ADDRESSED LETTER FROM

04:17:11.783 --> 04:17:16.087 region:rollup2
ALUMINUM CAN PULL TABS IS

04:17:13.785 --> 04:17:17.322 region:rollup2
CREATED AS. WAS PREVIOUSLY

04:17:16.087 --> 04:17:18.823 region:rollup2
STATED.

04:17:17.322 --> 04:17:20.392 region:rollup2
YEAH THE LEGISLATION IS OVERLY

04:17:18.823 --> 04:17:22.260 region:rollup2
ALREADY CONSIDERED THE BILL BUT

04:17:20.392 --> 04:17:24.362 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENTISTS

04:17:22.260 --> 04:17:25.830 region:rollup2
IT'S TIME TO FORCE.

04:17:24.362 --> 04:17:27.299 region:rollup2
A DECISION TO FIGURE THIS OUT

04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:29.401 region:rollup2
SURFRIDER IS FIVE HUNDRED

04:17:27.299 --> 04:17:30.902 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OR SO MEMBERS

04:17:29.401 --> 04:17:32.570 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS AND ACTIVISTS

04:17:30.902 --> 04:17:34.506 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTER BOTTLE CAPS AND OTHER

04:17:32.570 --> 04:17:36.174 region:rollup2
PLASTIC POLLUTION. WITH

04:17:34.506 --> 04:17:37.842 region:rollup2
INCREASING FREQUENCIES AS A

04:17:36.174 --> 04:17:39.944 region:rollup2
MATTER OF FACT JUST YESTERDAY I

04:17:37.842 --> 04:17:42.414 region:rollup2
WAS DOING WATER SAMPLES IN THE

04:17:39.944 --> 04:17:44.549 region:rollup2
BIO WETLANDS. WHICH WAS A TEAM

04:17:42.414 --> 04:17:46.785 region:rollup2
WITH WILDLIFE AND I PICKED UP A

04:17:44.549 --> 04:17:48.186 region:rollup2
BOTTLE CAPS REGULARLY THERE AND

04:17:46.785 --> 04:17:50.388 region:rollup2
THEY WERE EVERYWHERE SO WE THAT

04:17:48.186 --> 04:17:53.391 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

04:17:50.388 --> 04:17:54.759 region:rollup2
VOTE ON THIS MISSION.

04:17:53.391 --> 04:17:55.360 region:rollup2
GOOD EVENING SHARON MEMBERS

04:17:54.759 --> 04:17:56.761 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED

04:17:55.360 --> 04:17:57.829 region:rollup2
ATTENTION. KELLY MIGHT BE WITH

04:17:56.761 --> 04:17:59.297 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP

04:17:57.829 --> 04:18:00.432 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE HERE

04:17:59.297 --> 04:18:02.267 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN

04:18:00.432 --> 04:18:02.834 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE I'VE ALSO BEEN

04:18:02.267 --> 04:18:04.369 region:rollup2
ASKED TO REALLY SUPPORT FOR

04:18:02.834 --> 04:18:05.904 region:rollup2
UPSTREAM.

04:18:04.369 --> 04:18:07.372 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CONSUME

04:18:05.904 --> 04:18:07.939 region:rollup2
ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION

04:18:07.372 --> 04:18:09.975 region:rollup2
PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES EVERY

04:18:07.939 --> 04:18:11.876 region:rollup2
YEAR.

04:18:09.975 --> 04:18:12.377 region:rollup2
NO DESPITE OUR HIGH RECYCLING

04:18:11.876 --> 04:18:14.612 region:rollup2
RATE FOR THESE BEVERAGE

04:18:12.377 --> 04:18:16.247 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST

04:18:14.612 --> 04:18:18.116 region:rollup2
FIVE BILLION AND UP TO TEN

04:18:16.247 --> 04:18:19.651 region:rollup2
BILLION OF THE CAPS THAT BELONG

04:18:18.116 --> 04:18:21.619 region:rollup2
TO THOSE. BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

04:18:19.651 --> 04:18:23.021 region:rollup2
ARE NOT RECYCLED AND IN FACT AND

04:18:21.619 --> 04:18:24.189 region:rollup2
UP IN OUR LANDFILLS AND OUR

04:18:23.021 --> 04:18:25.457 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

04:18:24.189 --> 04:18:27.058 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF

04:18:25.457 --> 04:18:28.093 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIX

04:18:27.058 --> 04:18:29.661 region:rollup2
MILLION OF THESE PLASTIC BOTTLE

04:18:28.093 --> 04:18:32.130 region:rollup2
CAPS.

04:18:29.661 --> 04:18:33.365 region:rollup2
BEING DISCARDED EVERYDAY.

04:18:32.130 --> 04:18:35.100 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE

04:18:33.365 --> 04:18:36.501 region:rollup2
TOP THREE ITEMS FOUND DURING

04:18:35.100 --> 04:18:37.669 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BEACH CLEANUPS.

04:18:36.501 --> 04:18:39.404 region:rollup2
THESE PLASTIC BOTTLE CAPS

04:18:37.669 --> 04:18:40.839 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY IT POLLUTES OUR

04:18:39.404 --> 04:18:42.607 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTE

04:18:40.839 --> 04:18:44.008 region:rollup2
TO BLIGHT AS MENTIONED IN THE

04:18:42.607 --> 04:18:45.810 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS. AT TWO THOUSAND

04:18:44.008 --> 04:18:47.212 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN AN RTC STUDY FOUND THAT

04:18:45.810 --> 04:18:49.647 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES ARE

04:18:47.212 --> 04:18:51.149 region:rollup2
SPENDING CLOSE TO HALF A BILLION

04:18:49.647 --> 04:18:52.684 region:rollup2
DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.

04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:54.319 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT TRASH FROM ENTERING

04:18:52.684 --> 04:18:55.620 region:rollup2
THEIR STREETS PARKS AND STORM

04:18:54.319 --> 04:18:57.355 region:rollup2
DRAINS AND WE KNOW THAT THESE

04:18:55.620 --> 04:18:59.024 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE ONLY GOING TO RISE AS

04:18:57.355 --> 04:19:00.992 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RECENTLY ENACTED

04:18:59.024 --> 04:19:02.594 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS. REQUIRING LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS IVAN.

04:19:02.594 --> 04:19:05.630 region:rollup2
AND TO FURTHER REDUCE THE TRASH

04:19:03.762 --> 04:19:07.465 region:rollup2
LOW TO THE STORM DRAINS.

04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:08.700 region:rollup2
NAVY TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY NINE

04:19:07.465 --> 04:19:10.335 region:rollup2
DOES NOT MANDATE A PARTICULAR

TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE CONNECTED

04:19:10.335 --> 04:19:13.505 region:rollup2
CAPS BUT RATHER IT PROVIDES

04:19:12.203 --> 04:19:14.906 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO BEVERAGE

04:19:13.505 --> 04:19:16.841 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO DETERMINE THE

04:19:14.906 --> 04:19:18.143 region:rollup2
DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS

04:19:16.841 --> 04:19:21.012 region:rollup2
BEST FOR THEIR PRODUCT. AND

04:19:18.143 --> 04:19:21.613 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER BASE AND WE KNOW THAT

04:19:21.012 --> 04:19:22.714 region:rollup2
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE READILY

04:19:21.613 --> 04:19:23.982 region:rollup2

04:19:24.883 --> 04:19:27.886 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY TETHERING

04:19:26.751 --> 04:19:29.487 region:rollup2
CAPS ON ONE OF THEIR. WATER

04:19:27.886 --> 04:19:30.855 region:rollup2

04:19:29.487 --> 04:19:32.257 region:rollup2
I NOT ONLY PROTECTING OUR

04:19:30.855 --> 04:19:33.792 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT BUT REDUCING THE

04:19:32.257 --> 04:19:35.827 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OVERALL PLASTIC THEY

04:19:33.792 --> 04:19:36.694 region:rollup2
USE AND EVEN SAVING MONEY ON

04:19:35.827 --> 04:19:38.296 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCTION OF THIS LINE IN

04:19:36.694 --> 04:19:39.798 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

04:19:38.296 --> 04:19:41.933 region:rollup2
SEVERAL EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE

04:19:39.798 --> 04:19:43.468 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

04:19:41.933 --> 04:19:45.403 region:rollup2
FOR JUICE AND SPORTS DRINKS

04:19:43.468 --> 04:19:46.538 region:rollup2

AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET RIGHT

04:19:46.538 --> 04:19:49.474 region:rollup2
NOW. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR

EFFECTIVENESS IN USE FOR HOT

04:19:49.474 --> 04:19:53.945 region:rollup2
FILL AND CARBONATED BEVERAGES.

04:19:51.976 --> 04:19:55.680 region:rollup2
IN A FINAL POINT RECYCLERS WANT

04:19:53.945 --> 04:19:58.049 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE THE PLASTIC FROM

04:19:55.680 --> 04:19:59.918 region:rollup2
THESE CAPS RECYCLING EQUIPMENT

04:19:58.049 --> 04:20:01.152 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY DESIGNED TO HANDLE.

04:19:59.918 --> 04:20:02.654 region:rollup2
AYE THESE CAPS AND TO ATTACK

04:20:01.152 --> 04:20:03.822 region:rollup2
THEIR TOP WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW

04:20:02.654 --> 04:20:05.623 region:rollup2
RECYCLERS.

04:20:03.822 --> 04:20:07.325 region:rollup2
CAPTURE MORE OF THIS MATERIAL.

04:20:05.623 --> 04:20:08.827 region:rollup2

BUT WE FEEL THAT THIS.

04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:56.327 region:rollup2
BEING LED TO. A BUT.

04:22:54.058 --> 04:22:57.862 region:rollup2
ENCLOSURE FOR A BOTTLE. THAT

04:22:56.327 --> 04:22:58.663 region:rollup2
WILL STAY TETHERED

04:22:57.862 --> 04:22:59.597 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD FOR US

04:22:58.663 --> 04:23:01.599 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE.

04:22:59.597 --> 04:23:03.468 region:rollup2
.

04:23:01.599 --> 04:23:05.770 region:rollup2
I SPOKE WITH A FEW OF OUR

04:23:03.468 --> 04:23:07.205 region:rollup2
MACHINERY COMPANIES THAT WE DO

04:23:05.770 --> 04:23:08.940 region:rollup2
THAT WE USE FOR OUR

04:23:07.205 --> 04:23:09.941 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO PUT THE

04:23:08.940 --> 04:23:12.143 region:rollup2
CAP ON TWO BOTTLES.

04:23:09.941 --> 04:23:13.711 region:rollup2
THEY.

04:23:12.143 --> 04:23:15.613 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

04:23:13.711 --> 04:23:17.749 region:rollup2
CARBONATED SOFT DRINKS WITH THE

04:23:15.613 --> 04:23:18.950 region:rollup2
A FLIP TOP CAP.

04:23:17.749 --> 04:23:20.818 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BOTTLE WATER IS LOT LOT

04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:22.320 region:rollup2
EASIER TO PUT A CAP ON THAT ARE

04:23:20.818 --> 04:23:24.055 region:rollup2
TWO OTHER IT AND PUT SUPPORT CAP

04:23:22.320 --> 04:23:26.424 region:rollup2
ON. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A

04:23:24.055 --> 04:23:27.592 region:rollup2
CARBONATED SOFT DRINK WITH HIGH

04:23:26.424 --> 04:23:29.794 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ITEM AND WHEN YOU GO ON

04:23:27.592 --> 04:23:30.995 region:rollup2
A HOT FEEL. THERE ARE SOME

04:23:29.794 --> 04:23:32.830 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THAT.

04:23:30.995 --> 04:23:34.332 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THE SPORT CAP.

04:23:32.830 --> 04:23:37.268 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SPORT CAP

04:23:34.332 --> 04:23:38.469 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS WHEN I HEAR. IS A KIND

04:23:37.268 --> 04:23:40.538 region:rollup2
OF LIKE THE HIGH END THIS

04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:42.473 region:rollup2
WORKOUT THERE'S ALSO THERE'S ALL

04:23:40.538 --> 04:23:44.442 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GOING TO BEA. BILL FOR

04:23:42.473 --> 04:23:45.777 region:rollup2
BRING ON THE SAME.

04:23:44.442 --> 04:23:46.811 region:rollup2
TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM OPENING A

04:23:45.777 --> 04:23:48.513 region:rollup2
MINUTE STORES TAMPERING WITH

04:23:46.811 --> 04:23:50.181 region:rollup2
THEM.

04:23:48.513 --> 04:23:51.516 region:rollup2
AND THAT PILFERING ONCE PULLED

04:23:50.181 --> 04:23:53.484 region:rollup2
OFF.

04:23:51.516 --> 04:23:55.219 region:rollup2
GETS DISCARDED.

04:23:53.484 --> 04:23:56.921 region:rollup2
USUALLY AT HIGHER HIGHER RATE

04:23:55.219 --> 04:23:59.057 region:rollup2
THAN WITH THE CAP.

04:23:56.921 --> 04:23:59.691 region:rollup2
SO THIS RING COMES OFF AND YOU

04:23:59.057 --> 04:24:01.526 region:rollup2
DO HAVE THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC.

04:23:59.691 --> 04:24:03.161 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:24:01.526 --> 04:24:03.327 region:rollup2
MAJORITY TIMES. TOSSED BECAUSE

04:24:03.161 --> 04:24:05.496 region:rollup2
IT'S

04:24:03.327 --> 04:24:06.998 region:rollup2
LEFT OVER.

04:24:05.496 --> 04:24:08.900 region:rollup2
A SECOND THING THAT PEOPLE DO

04:24:06.998 --> 04:24:09.801 region:rollup2
WITH WORKSHOPS IS THEY'VE.

04:24:08.900 --> 04:24:12.003 region:rollup2
TAKE OFF LIKE THIS

04:24:09.801 --> 04:24:13.604 region:rollup2
AND DRINK FROM IT.

04:24:12.003 --> 04:24:16.040 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE A CAP THAT IS NOW

04:24:13.604 --> 04:24:18.776 region:rollup2
REMOVED FROM THE BOTTLE.

04:24:16.040 --> 04:24:19.410 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I PUT MY CAPS BACK ON.

04:24:18.776 --> 04:24:20.545 region:rollup2

DON'T.

04:24:20.545 --> 04:24:23.381 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THERE.

04:24:21.412 --> 04:24:26.551 region:rollup2
.

04:24:23.381 --> 04:24:27.585 region:rollup2

04:24:30.955 --> 04:24:33.858 region:rollup2
EDUCATE PEOPLE ON TRYING TO KEEP

04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:35.059 region:rollup2

CONTAINERS.

04:24:35.059 --> 04:24:38.730 region:rollup2
BUT WE FEEL THAT.

04:24:36.928 --> 04:24:41.032 region:rollup2
HAVING BE MANDATED TO HAVE A

04:24:38.730 --> 04:24:42.900 region:rollup2

04:24:49.707 --> 04:24:52.377 region:rollup2
SPEND.

04:24:50.675 --> 04:24:53.578 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SOME

04:24:52.377 --> 04:24:56.080 region:rollup2
MACHINERY IT'S IT'S GONNA HIT

04:24:53.578 --> 04:24:57.048 region:rollup2
OUR BOTTOM LINE PRETTY HARD.

04:24:56.080 --> 04:25:00.051 region:rollup2

04:30:06.457 --> 04:30:09.260 region:rollup2
THAT MANDATING CAPS ON ALL

04:30:07.792 --> 04:30:10.461 region:rollup2

PROMOTE ANY ONE PARTICULAR

04:33:32.096 --> 04:33:35.766 region:rollup2
SOLUTION NOT JUST ASK THE

INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE WHAT. WITH

04:33:35.766 --> 04:33:39.203 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE SMALL BOTTLERS

04:33:36.634 --> 04:33:40.437 region:rollup2

THE SITUATION IS MORE BOTTLER

04:33:40.437 --> 04:33:43.507 region:rollup2
HAS FOUND THEM THEMSELVES IN THE

04:33:42.506 --> 04:33:45.476 region:rollup2
EASY SOLUTION FOR THEM TO

04:33:43.507 --> 04:33:47.177 region:rollup2
SUCCUMB ASK WOULD WE BE WILLING

TO PUT. A.

04:33:47.177 --> 04:33:52.016 region:rollup2
A CAP ON THIS OR SAY ONLY FOR

04:33:50.214 --> 04:33:54.218 region:rollup2
LARGE BOTTLERS NOT FOR SMALL

04:33:52.016 --> 04:33:55.719 region:rollup2
BOTTLERS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT

04:33:54.218 --> 04:33:57.221 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A REAL

04:33:55.719 --> 04:33:59.123 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

04:33:57.221 --> 04:34:02.526 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BILL FOR OVER A YEAR

04:33:59.123 --> 04:34:04.128 region:rollup2
NOW. AND PARTLY. THAT THE REASON

04:34:02.526 --> 04:34:05.596 region:rollup2
WHY I THINK THIS IS I'M HOPING

04:34:04.128 --> 04:34:06.430 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN PASS THIS THROUGH.

04:34:05.596 --> 04:34:08.299 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN SHOW THAT WE'RE GONNA

04:34:06.430 --> 04:34:09.133 region:rollup2
MOVE THIS AND THIS IS ONE THE

04:34:08.299 --> 04:34:10.167 region:rollup2
REASONS MISTER CALDERON CAME ON

04:34:09.133 --> 04:34:11.502 region:rollup2
BOARD BECAUSE HE'S VERY

04:34:10.167 --> 04:34:12.936 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTIC

04:34:11.502 --> 04:34:14.371 region:rollup2
POLLUTION THE AMOUNT OF CLASSICS

04:34:12.936 --> 04:34:16.206 region:rollup2
THAT WE FIND IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.

04:34:14.371 --> 04:34:18.075 region:rollup2
BOTTLE CAPS IS ONE NAY V. MOST

04:34:16.206 --> 04:34:19.443 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IN UBIQUITOUS PIECES

04:34:18.075 --> 04:34:20.344 region:rollup2
OF TRASH THAT'S OUT THERE.

04:34:19.443 --> 04:34:22.112 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALWAYS SAY WELL THE

04:34:20.344 --> 04:34:24.248 region:rollup2
LETTERING ISSUE LET'S JUST DO A

04:34:22.112 --> 04:34:25.382 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT

04:34:24.248 --> 04:34:27.418 region:rollup2
HAS.

04:34:25.382 --> 04:34:28.952 region:rollup2
NEVER WORKED IN THE PAST I DON'T

04:34:27.418 --> 04:34:30.187 region:rollup2
KNOW WHY IT WOULD WORK NOW.

04:34:28.952 --> 04:34:31.889 region:rollup2
SO CREATING A REALISTIC

04:34:30.187 --> 04:34:33.857 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE FOR DATES A REALISTIC

04:34:31.889 --> 04:34:35.459 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE FOR THE KINDS OF

04:34:33.857 --> 04:34:37.194 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES A WHICH BOTTLES

04:34:35.459 --> 04:34:38.128 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING ABOUT. BROKE INTO

04:34:37.194 --> 04:34:40.564 region:rollup2
THAT THEM SPEAKING ABOUT BEHALF

04:34:38.128 --> 04:34:41.131 region:rollup2
OF MYSELF AND MISTER CALDERON

04:34:40.564 --> 04:34:42.766 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

04:34:41.131 --> 04:34:43.534 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:34:42.766 --> 04:34:44.768 region:rollup2
BUT HE WAS LIKE OUTSIDE THE

04:34:43.534 --> 04:34:45.936 region:rollup2
COMPANY SIDE THE BOTTLERS. WE'RE

04:34:44.768 --> 04:34:47.137 region:rollup2
OPEN TO THAT.

04:34:45.936 --> 04:34:48.972 region:rollup2
MAKE IS ENOUGH.

04:34:47.137 --> 04:34:50.074 region:rollup2
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT

04:34:48.972 --> 04:34:51.442 region:rollup2
A SIMPLE NO WE'RE DONE WITH THE

04:34:50.074 --> 04:34:52.142 region:rollup2
NOW.

04:34:51.442 --> 04:34:53.777 region:rollup2
AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS

04:34:52.142 --> 04:34:54.812 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF OUR

04:34:53.777 --> 04:34:55.779 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS TO DEAL IN OUR

04:34:54.812 --> 04:34:57.948 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS TO TALK THROUGH THE

04:34:55.779 --> 04:34:59.216 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

04:34:57.948 --> 04:35:00.984 region:rollup2
AND REALLY LOOK FOR A SOLUTION

04:34:59.216 --> 04:35:01.785 region:rollup2
SET UP A REALISTIC TIME LINE

04:35:00.984 --> 04:35:03.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO BE

04:35:01.785 --> 04:35:05.789 region:rollup2
AFRAID OF HERE.

04:35:03.987 --> 04:35:07.224 region:rollup2
WE CAN SAY NO WE'RE GOOD THAT WE

04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:08.392 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TO SHUT THINGS DOWN.

04:35:07.224 --> 04:35:09.660 region:rollup2
SINGLE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I GET

04:35:08.392 --> 04:35:11.495 region:rollup2
BUT ABOUT THIS BILL IN MY

04:35:09.660 --> 04:35:12.029 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS WHY DON'T I JUST

04:35:11.495 --> 04:35:13.597 region:rollup2
BANNED SINGLE USE PLASTIC

04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:14.198 region:rollup2
BOTTLES.

04:35:13.597 --> 04:35:15.366 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF

04:35:14.198 --> 04:35:16.200 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ARE TALK ABOUT

04:35:15.366 --> 04:35:17.701 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING

04:35:16.200 --> 04:35:19.002 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE BECAUSE I'D RATHER.

04:35:17.701 --> 04:35:19.903 region:rollup2
TAKE THE STEP TO TRY AND WORK

04:35:19.002 --> 04:35:21.638 region:rollup2
WITH THE INDUSTRY.

04:35:19.903 --> 04:35:23.173 region:rollup2
TO MODIFY THE PRODUCTS

04:35:21.638 --> 04:35:24.775 region:rollup2
MAKE THE PRODUCT LESS HARMFUL

04:35:23.173 --> 04:35:26.243 region:rollup2
FOR THE VERY SPECIFIC REASONS

04:35:24.775 --> 04:35:26.744 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:35:26.243 --> 04:35:28.345 region:rollup2
AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY

04:35:26.744 --> 04:35:29.546 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

04:35:28.345 --> 04:35:31.515 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING AT THIS

04:35:29.546 --> 04:35:32.649 region:rollup2

BE THE FLOOR WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

04:35:37.654 --> 04:35:42.993 region:rollup2

LOOK AT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

04:35:43.560 --> 04:35:45.529 region:rollup2
DONE.

04:35:44.528 --> 04:35:47.564 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE GOOD FAITH WE'VE

04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:48.932 region:rollup2
ENTERED INTO AND LOOK AT THE

04:35:47.564 --> 04:35:49.133 region:rollup2
ABSENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND

04:35:48.932 --> 04:35:50.934 region:rollup2

ISSUE SOME LIKE WITH THIS BOTTLE

04:38:09.573 --> 04:38:12.176 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE

04:38:10.774 --> 04:38:14.144 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT WITH THE WATER BOTTLES

04:38:12.176 --> 04:38:15.279 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS EASIER. AND I DID

04:38:14.144 --> 04:38:16.914 region:rollup2
SEE THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE

04:38:15.279 --> 04:38:18.849 region:rollup2
BROUGHT BY THE OFFICES.

04:38:18.849 --> 04:38:23.120 region:rollup2
NOT A SIMPLE AND I JUST I'M

04:38:21.218 --> 04:38:26.857 region:rollup2

WAY AROUND.

04:38:34.364 --> 04:38:36.567 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND

04:38:34.932 --> 04:38:38.535 region:rollup2
THIS PLACE.

04:38:36.567 --> 04:38:40.370 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WANNA DO IS REDUCE

04:38:38.535 --> 04:38:42.339 region:rollup2
PLASTIC POLLUTION AND REDUCE THE

04:38:40.370 --> 04:38:42.973 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF. BOTTLE CAPS THAT WE

04:38:42.339 --> 04:38:44.875 region:rollup2
FIND OUT.

04:38:42.973 --> 04:38:46.877 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY.

04:38:44.875 --> 04:38:48.312 region:rollup2

BILL ANY POINT IN TIME SO IT'S

04:39:07.564 --> 04:39:09.1000 region:rollup2
NOT WORTH THEIR TIME. TO COME

THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE WERE

04:41:39.583 --> 04:41:43.854 region:rollup2

LEGISLATING IN MY OPINION.

04:42:27.831 --> 04:42:30.700 region:rollup2

04:42:33.937 --> 04:42:37.874 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN

04:42:35.605 --> 04:42:38.909 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AMEND YOU CAN AGREE. YOU

04:42:37.874 --> 04:42:40.076 region:rollup2

OFFERING IS TO.

04:42:41.945 --> 04:42:46.850 region:rollup2
TAKE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL.

04:42:44.147 --> 04:42:48.151 region:rollup2

THROUGH THIS.

04:42:53.723 --> 04:42:55.826 region:rollup2
THE PART THAT'S NOT COOKED IS

04:42:54.324 --> 04:42:57.594 region:rollup2
THE DAY.

04:42:55.826 --> 04:43:00.530 region:rollup2
WE LEFT THAT OPEN ON THIS ONE

04:42:57.594 --> 04:43:00.997 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT I DID THAT WAS

04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:02.632 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT POINT OF

04:43:00.997 --> 04:43:04.134 region:rollup2
CONTENTION.

04:43:02.632 --> 04:43:05.468 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THERE'S A TIMELINE WE

04:43:04.134 --> 04:43:06.303 region:rollup2
CAN TALK ABOUT THE PREVIOUS BILL

04:43:05.468 --> 04:43:08.338 region:rollup2
TIMELINE WAS TWENTY TWENTY.

04:43:06.303 --> 04:43:10.106 region:rollup2

AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE DATE IS

04:43:12.776 --> 04:43:15.912 region:rollup2
THE DATE A VERY EASY THING TO TO

04:43:14.678 --> 04:43:17.147 region:rollup2
TO PUT IN THERE. AND THIS

04:43:15.912 --> 04:43:18.482 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD MOVE THIS BILL

04:43:17.147 --> 04:43:19.716 region:rollup2
AS IT IS.

04:43:18.482 --> 04:43:21.751 region:rollup2
WE COULD PUT THE DATE IN THERE

04:43:19.716 --> 04:43:23.420 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRE ALL BOTTLES TO HAVE

04:43:21.751 --> 04:43:25.088 region:rollup2

04:43:23.420 --> 04:43:26.690 region:rollup2

04:43:25.088 --> 04:43:28.325 region:rollup2
THE PART THAT'S.

04:43:26.690 --> 04:43:29.893 region:rollup2
THE PURVIEW OF THIS LEGISLATURE

04:43:28.325 --> 04:43:30.760 region:rollup2

04:43:37.901 --> 04:43:42.339 region:rollup2

PRODUCTION IN OUR STATE.

04:56:48.290 --> 04:56:51.293 region:rollup2
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL.

04:56:50.159 --> 04:56:52.928 region:rollup2
THEN DEMAND WILL STILL BE IN OUR

04:56:51.293 --> 04:56:54.897 region:rollup2
STATE.

04:56:52.928 --> 04:56:57.333 region:rollup2

ANOTHER MOLD TO TRANSPORTATION

04:56:58.301 --> 04:57:02.004 region:rollup2
IT WILL NOT CEASE.

04:57:00.636 --> 04:57:03.973 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCTION VERSES USE

04:57:02.004 --> 04:57:05.708 region:rollup2
DEFICIT WILL INCREASE NOW AND IN

THE FUTURE IF THIS BILL PASSES

04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:08.544 region:rollup2
IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

04:57:07.643 --> 04:57:10.279 region:rollup2
HOWEVER TRANSPORTATION FUEL FROM

TRANSPORTATION FROM TANKERS

04:57:11.847 --> 04:57:15.017 region:rollup2
WILL INCREASE

04:57:13.549 --> 04:57:16.252 region:rollup2
SPEWING THE EMISSIONS THAT

S. B. THIRTY TWO AND OTHERS

04:57:23.192 --> 04:57:26.162 region:rollup2

ALSO IMPACT MORE THAN THREE

04:57:26.162 --> 04:57:29.498 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN

THIS INDUSTRY.

04:57:29.498 --> 04:57:32.101 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

04:57:30.433 --> 04:57:34.470 region:rollup2
THAT'S AS MUCH.

04:57:32.101 --> 04:57:35.838 region:rollup2
S. AS MANY AS MANY EMPLOYEES AT

04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:36.305 region:rollup2

04:57:39.208 --> 04:57:42.011 region:rollup2
I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT

04:57:52.521 --> 04:57:55.858 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

04:57:53.956 --> 04:57:57.693 region:rollup2

AS I CLOSE MEMBERS IT'S

04:58:05.234 --> 04:58:08.838 region:rollup2
TROUBLING IN A BIT DISTURBING

04:58:06.369 --> 04:58:10.306 region:rollup2

AND OIL.

04:58:21.383 --> 04:58:24.220 region:rollup2
IF THE BILL NEEDS MENDING LET'S

UNPREPARED TO GO TO THE POLICY

04:58:32.394 --> 04:58:35.464 region:rollup2

NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD

05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:45.054 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR INCREASED

THAT WANT US TO AS A COUNTRY NOT

05:01:53.095 --> 05:01:56.131 region:rollup2
AS BEING HONEST RELEASED A STATE

05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:56.465 region:rollup2

WHICH.

05:01:57.666 --> 05:02:00.469 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER HAPPEN

COMPLETELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT

05:02:00.469 --> 05:02:03.772 region:rollup2

05:02:01.837 --> 05:02:05.574 region:rollup2
DO THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MORE

05:02:03.772 --> 05:02:07.977 region:rollup2
STRIDES TOWARD BECOMING MORE

05:02:05.574 --> 05:02:09.745 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT BECAUSE.

05:02:07.977 --> 05:02:12.147 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE THE

05:02:12.147 --> 05:02:16.652 region:rollup2
INTO AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THOSE

05:02:14.216 --> 05:02:18.354 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FROM COUNTRIES THAT

05:02:16.652 --> 05:02:20.489 region:rollup2
DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES CERTAINLY

05:02:18.354 --> 05:02:22.191 region:rollup2
DON'T SHARE CALIFORNIA'S VALUES

05:02:20.489 --> 05:02:23.325 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LGBT

05:02:22.191 --> 05:02:24.827 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO HOW

05:02:23.325 --> 05:02:26.228 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE TREATED WHEN IT COMES

05:02:24.827 --> 05:02:27.096 region:rollup2
TO. HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.

05:02:26.228 --> 05:02:28.931 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT THEY ARE THE EXACT

05:02:27.096 --> 05:02:30.632 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE.

05:02:28.931 --> 05:02:33.535 region:rollup2
HOW CALIFORNIA FEELS IN AMERICA

05:02:30.632 --> 05:02:35.771 region:rollup2
FEELS SO WHEN I SEE BILLS LIKE

05:02:33.535 --> 05:02:37.973 region:rollup2
THIS AYE I THINK WHAT GOSH THESE

05:02:35.771 --> 05:02:40.342 region:rollup2
ARE MY CHOICES HE NOW GO WITH

05:02:37.973 --> 05:02:42.111 region:rollup2
THIS BILL OR OR YOU?

05:02:40.342 --> 05:02:43.912 region:rollup2
OR ARE GO WITH.

05:02:42.111 --> 05:02:45.280 region:rollup2
TAKING FUEL FROM COUNTRIES THAT

05:02:43.912 --> 05:02:47.649 region:rollup2
DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO FELLOW

05:02:45.280 --> 05:02:49.885 region:rollup2
HUMAN BEINGS.

05:02:47.649 --> 05:02:51.553 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHICH ARE OWNED FITNESS.

05:02:49.885 --> 05:02:53.288 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S JUST NOT A CHOICE

05:02:51.553 --> 05:02:55.791 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IS FAIR TO ASK US

05:02:53.288 --> 05:02:57.693 region:rollup2
TO MAKE I'M.

05:02:55.791 --> 05:03:00.195 region:rollup2
I WISH THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS

05:02:57.693 --> 05:03:02.364 region:rollup2
MORE OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU

05:03:00.195 --> 05:03:03.999 region:rollup2
AND THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT

05:03:02.364 --> 05:03:05.434 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW YOU COULD SOME HOW

05:03:03.999 --> 05:03:06.935 region:rollup2
MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND EAST COME

05:03:05.434 --> 05:03:09.538 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

05:03:06.935 --> 05:03:10.939 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD BET THAT IF I ASKED

05:03:09.538 --> 05:03:13.942 region:rollup2
THE TWO OPPONENTS TO COME UP

05:03:10.939 --> 05:03:15.844 region:rollup2
HERE AND RESPOND TO YOU SAYING

05:03:13.942 --> 05:03:17.179 region:rollup2
THAT NO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

05:03:15.844 --> 05:03:19.181 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THEM.

05:03:17.179 --> 05:03:20.416 region:rollup2
AT A IF THEIR EXISTING WHILE IS

05:03:19.181 --> 05:03:21.850 region:rollup2
THAT IT WON'T TOUCH THEM AT ALL

05:03:20.416 --> 05:03:23.218 region:rollup2
I JUST I FEEL LIKE THEY WOULD

05:03:21.850 --> 05:03:25.320 region:rollup2
HAVE.

05:03:23.218 --> 05:03:26.188 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT ANSWER THEY HIM YOU

05:03:25.320 --> 05:03:28.057 region:rollup2
WOULD.

05:03:26.188 --> 05:03:29.024 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT AGAIN IS NOT

05:03:28.057 --> 05:03:30.059 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE A DEBATES ARE NOT

05:03:29.024 --> 05:03:31.860 region:rollup2
GOING TO PUT YOU IN THAT

05:03:30.059 --> 05:03:33.162 region:rollup2
POSITION I WOULDN'T ASK OUT OF.

05:03:31.860 --> 05:03:34.863 region:rollup2
RESPECT FOR YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP

05:03:33.162 --> 05:03:37.066 region:rollup2
AND THE LATE HOUR THAT IT IS.

05:03:34.863 --> 05:03:38.634 region:rollup2

VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT AS ARE

05:03:45.274 --> 05:03:48.210 region:rollup2
MOST CALIFORNIANS I THINK WITH

05:03:46.842 --> 05:03:49.378 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO OUR COASTLINE. BUT I

05:03:48.210 --> 05:03:50.679 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

05:03:49.378 --> 05:03:52.681 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO

05:03:50.679 --> 05:03:54.383 region:rollup2
DO THIS WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUR

05:03:52.681 --> 05:03:56.685 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VALUES AND PRINCIPLES

05:03:54.383 --> 05:03:58.454 region:rollup2
AND MORALS IN EXCHANGE FOR.

05:03:56.685 --> 05:03:59.822 region:rollup2

THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THE PASSION

05:04:02.257 --> 05:04:04.827 region:rollup2
COMES FROM A VERY LIVED

05:04:03.258 --> 05:04:06.395 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN THE PASSION ALSO

05:04:04.827 --> 05:04:08.397 region:rollup2
COMES? FROM REPRESENTING A

05:04:06.395 --> 05:04:09.765 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN REALLY

05:04:08.397 --> 05:04:11.967 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY THIS.

05:04:09.765 --> 05:04:13.702 region:rollup2
AND IN A THINK TO YOUR POINT.

05:04:11.967 --> 05:04:15.437 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING COMPELLING

05:04:13.702 --> 05:04:17.806 region:rollup2
INTERESTS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR

05:04:15.437 --> 05:04:19.108 region:rollup2

05:04:17.806 --> 05:04:20.676 region:rollup2

05:04:19.108 --> 05:04:22.878 region:rollup2

ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT

05:04:25.013 --> 05:04:28.717 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE ANGLE TO LOOK AT THIS

05:04:27.015 --> 05:04:31.220 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ANGLE IS WHAT DO WE DO

05:04:28.717 --> 05:04:32.988 region:rollup2
S. CALIFORNIANS. TO ENSURE THAT

05:04:31.220 --> 05:04:34.423 region:rollup2
WERE MORE MOVING MORE TOWARDS

05:04:32.988 --> 05:04:36.458 region:rollup2
THE GREEN ECONOMY RIGHT TO A

05:04:34.423 --> 05:04:38.327 region:rollup2
GREEN MOVEMENT A MOVEMENT THAT

05:04:36.458 --> 05:04:40.295 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A LINES TO OTHER

05:04:38.327 --> 05:04:42.064 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VALUES OF WANTING TO

05:04:40.295 --> 05:04:43.332 region:rollup2
PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT OF

05:04:42.064 --> 05:04:44.666 region:rollup2
WANTING TO HAVE CLEAN WATER AND

05:04:43.332 --> 05:04:46.268 region:rollup2
CLEAN AIR AND I THINK THAT

05:04:44.666 --> 05:04:48.137 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM.

CONFLICTING COMPELLING INTEREST

05:04:50.072 --> 05:04:54.243 region:rollup2
ON BUT I THINK THAT UP FOR ME

05:04:52.574 --> 05:04:56.345 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MY

05:04:54.243 --> 05:04:58.680 region:rollup2
FELLOW CO AUTHOR AND OR AUTHOR

05:04:56.345 --> 05:05:00.916 region:rollup2
AND THE JOINT. AND IT'S IT IS

05:04:58.680 --> 05:05:03.018 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR

05:05:00.916 --> 05:05:06.121 region:rollup2
SPACE TO A SPACE THAT IS ALIGNED

05:05:03.018 --> 05:05:06.755 region:rollup2
WITH CALIFORNIA VALUES AND I

05:05:06.121 --> 05:05:08.157 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WHEN I BROUGHT THAT.

05:05:06.755 --> 05:05:09.992 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION FORWARD I AM I

05:05:08.157 --> 05:05:11.160 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IT FORWARD KNOWING THAT

05:05:09.992 --> 05:05:12.694 region:rollup2
MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF

05:05:11.160 --> 05:05:14.329 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FEELS THAT THIS AND

05:05:12.694 --> 05:05:15.964 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT LETTER

05:05:14.329 --> 05:05:17.633 region:rollup2
IS NEXT TO THEIR VOTING RECORD.

05:05:15.964 --> 05:05:18.467 region:rollup2
AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I

05:05:17.633 --> 05:05:20.502 region:rollup2
THINK IS REFLECTIVE OF FOR

05:05:18.467 --> 05:05:22.171 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS A STATE WANTS TO

05:05:20.502 --> 05:05:24.306 region:rollup2
SEE US GO ANSWER FOR THOSE

05:05:22.171 --> 05:05:24.940 region:rollup2
REASONS WE FIGHT FOR IT.

05:05:24.306 --> 05:05:26.074 region:rollup2
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT.

05:05:24.940 --> 05:05:27.376 region:rollup2
.

05:05:26.074 --> 05:05:29.044 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I MEAN MY DISTRICT IS A

05:05:27.376 --> 05:05:30.212 region:rollup2
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE YOU HEARD THE

05:05:29.044 --> 05:05:32.614 region:rollup2
GENTLEMAN FROM THE SURFRIDER

05:05:30.212 --> 05:05:33.182 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION TO TESTIFY ABOUT HOW

IN HERMOSA BEACH THERE THERE

05:05:33.182 --> 05:05:36.318 region:rollup2
WAS.

05:05:34.650 --> 05:05:38.921 region:rollup2
OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE

05:05:36.318 --> 05:05:40.589 region:rollup2
OPPOSE NEW OIL DRILLING IN

05:05:38.921 --> 05:05:42.424 region:rollup2
HERMOSA BEACH AND THAT'S WHEN

05:05:40.589 --> 05:05:43.959 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET TO THOSE KIND OF

05:05:42.424 --> 05:05:46.428 region:rollup2
NUMBERS WITHOUT HAVING.

05:05:43.959 --> 05:05:46.695 region:rollup2

OPPOSING OIL DRILLING THAT THAT

05:05:50.165 --> 05:05:52.534 region:rollup2
THREATENS OUR OUR OUR COAST IN

05:05:51.667 --> 05:05:54.036 region:rollup2
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

05:05:52.534 --> 05:05:55.637 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE SEE THAT

05:05:54.036 --> 05:05:55.838 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COAST WHICH IS

05:05:55.637 --> 05:05:57.673 region:rollup2
WHY.

05:05:55.838 --> 05:05:59.608 region:rollup2

DRILLING

05:06:04.279 --> 05:06:07.182 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE MADE THE CHOICE THAT

05:06:05.647 --> 05:06:08.750 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD RATHER. PUT THEIR.

05:06:07.182 --> 05:06:10.619 region:rollup2
