SO IF- THERE'S NO FURTHER. COMMENT AT THIS TIME WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT- UNDER OUR ITEMS TO BE HEARD- ISSUES NUMBER ONE THROUGH FOUR. THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. YES GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WILL SHOPS ONE AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AT STATE PARKS GREAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE THANK YOU THIS ITEM SIX PROVIDE SHORT TERM SUSTAINABILITY TO THE HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT. THIS FUND PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR BOATING RELATED PROGRAMS AT THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS STATE PARK UNITS. AND SEVERAL OTHER DEPARTMENTS FOR AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR REFLECTS A BALANCED APPROACH THAT REDUCES APPROPRIATIONS SUSPENSE CERTAIN TRANSFERS AND INCREASES THE VESSEL REGISTRATION. TWENTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS ON A BIANNUAL BASIS OR TEN TO THIRTY FIVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO REFLECTS INPUT RECEIVED FROM BOATING AND WATERWAYS COMMISSION AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT OCCURRED DURING COMMISSION MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS OR THE- PREVIOUS YEAR. THIS IS A FIRM APPROACH INTENDED TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM SOLVENCY TO THE FARM WELL LONGER TERM SUSTAINABLE MEASURES ARE EXPLORED. SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER MOVING TO MAKE YOUR VESSEL REGISTRATION. THAT WOULD BE BASED ON BUSTLING. THIS WILL PROMOTE MORE AFFABLE APPROACHED A FEW RAISING. DISCUSSIONS ALSO INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME OF THE COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITIES YOUNG BEING W. TRIGGERS COST. AND HAVE FLEXIBILITY STRUCTURING EXPLORING NON MOTORIZED VESSELS IS EXPANDING THE QUALITY OF OUR PROGRAM MORE BROADLY COVER COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH THE A. I. S. PROGRAM. SO HOW DO GET HERE. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS INSPECTORS HAVE RISEN YOU PROGRAM SOMETHING FUNDED FROM SOME REVENUES HAVE DECLINED. SPECIFICALLY IN OUR QUALITY THIS IS SPECIES PROGRAM WHICH TREATS WATER HYACINTH DONS A EXPENDITURES HAVE GROWN FROM SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR TRANSFERS TO THE PUMP BEACH RESTORATION FUND TO SUPPORT GRANTS FOR BEACH NOURISHMENT ISSUE ALSO WERE INITIATED. INTRODUCTION OF THESE FOR RECURRING OBLIGATIONS HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT PRESSURES ON THE SPOT. IN THE BUDGET ACT INITIATED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL TRANSFER TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. TO REPAIR FACILITY DEBT AND FUND PROGRAMS RELATED TO RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES ITS STATE WATER PROJECT WRESTLERS. ADDITIONALLY THE DIVISION OF BLOOD IN THE WATER IS LIKE ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS HAS EXPERIENCED RISING WAY COMPENSATION COSTS FOR WAGES. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS HEALTHCARE COSTS. YES US QUESTIONS HAVE NOT HAD A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REVENUE RESOURCES ADDITIONAL WHAT. FONT FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CLARIFICATION TO THE WAY THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TRANSFERS FUEL TAXES. REDUCE THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY THE HEART OF WATER PROPER BONE FUND BY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS PROPOSAL THE FUND IS FACING A FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL DEFICIT I WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE SERVICES AT CURRENT LEVELS. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS A BALANCED APPROACH TO SOLVING THAT DEFICIT BY RAISING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS WALLACE FORTY NINE. SEEKING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND SUSPENDING TRANSFERS TOTHE PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A PRACTICAL MEASURE TO TAKE IN THE SHORT TERM THAT PRIORITIZES KEEPING ALSO REGISTRATION FEES WHILE. MAINTAINING SERVICE LEVELS AND LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND REQUEST. WE ARE PROPOSING APPROPRIATION REDUCTIONS IN OUR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. PRIORITIZE OPERATIONS THE HIGHEST NEED RECOGNIZE THE STORE CLOSED ITS MANAGER CAPTURE SCENES IN ORDER. THIS INCLUDES DECREASE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TO STAY OPERATIONS FOCUSED PRIMARILY PRIMARILY ON THE QUALICUM SPECIES. THIS PROGRAM WILL HOLD CERTAIN POSITIONS BAKER I'M PRIORITIZE ST MERRY'S AND MAY REDUCE OVERALL ACREAGE AND TREATMENTS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. HOWEVER WE DON'T EXPECT TRAIL CHANGES TO THE SERVICE OF THE RIVER BY THE DIVISION AND MAILING ON GREATER REIMBURSEMENTS FROM. THE FORMER WATER RESOURCES TO OFFSET THIS REDUCTION. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A DECREASE OF ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION WHO WILL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING. FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARINE A LOAN PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN UNDER PRESCRIBE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH DEMAND EXISTS FOR THIS PROGRAM. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL THESE INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS GENERATE RUNNING FROM OURS WATER PREFERABLE THAN WE ARE PROPOSING PARSONS PROGRAM. UNTIL WE CAN ASSESS WHETHER DEMAND CAN SUPPORT FUTURE CRIME RATES. ARE THIS IS ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF INTEREST RATES. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING A FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION BOAT LAUNCH FACILITY GRANTS. THESE GRANTS ARE MADE TO QUALIFYING PUBLIC AGENCIES TO FOCUSSOLELY SUCH AS RAMPS OR INCLUDES ASSOCIATED PARKING AREAS RESTROOMS LIGHTING. THIS REDUCTION REPRESENTS THE TRUE AVERAGE SPEND OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE PAST FIVE YEARS IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON BY A PARENTS ARE PROVIDED. FINALLY WE ARE PROPOSING A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REDUCTION OGDENSBURG MUSSEL INFESTATION GRANTS PROGRAM. IS BROWN SUPPORT PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WORSE FOR MUSLIMS STATION. AGAIN THIS PRODUCTION REPRESENTS THE TRUE AVERAGE SPEND OF THESE PROGRAMS OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATIONS ANOTHER MARINE PATROL OPERATIONS. HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL DOES CONSIDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CAP THE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM AT ITS CURRENT LEVEL SO THAT THE FEE INCREASES NOT CORRODED BY NEW OBLIGATIONS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM. CURRENTLY EXCEEDS THE STATUTORY MINIMUM BY ABOUT SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE ARE PROPOSING SUSPENDED FOR TWO TRANSFERS FROM H. W. R. L. DAVIS DOLLAR TRANSFER AND THE POPE EACH RESTORATION TRANSFER. IT IS DAHLE TRANSFERS WILL BE SUPPLANTED BY GENERAL FUND FOR TWO YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO KEEP THE BUS OF THE REGISTRATION INCREASES LOS POSSIBLE A LONGER TERM SOLUTION IS EXPLORE. WE ALSO PROPOSES MANY PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION BACKGROUNDS RISEN TO ALTERNATE SOURCES WOULD BE IDENTIFIED. WELL WE BELIEVE THIS EXPENSE IS PROGRAM FOR THE H. W. R. L. IN OUR VIEW IT DOES NOT CONFER IT'S PAST DIRECT BENEFIT ON VOTERS TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. BOTH RETENTION. FINALLY WE ARE PROPOSING A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PER YEAR OR FIFTY DOLLAR BI ANNUAL RENEWAL AND EXPRESS OUR INSPIRATION. IF YOU'LL CHANGE FROM TEN DOLLARS TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. FOR ANNUAL REGISTRATION PAID IN AN EVEN YEAR OR TWENTY THE SEVENTY DOLLAR FINANCIAL ALL YOUR- REGISTRATION. THE LAST INCREASE FOR THIS THE WAS DONE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. WHEN IT WAS RAISED FROM TEN DOLLARS TO TWENTY DOLLARS BY. WE HAVE INCLUDED THREE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR DMV SYSTEM CHANGES TO FACILITATE THE SPEAKERS THE PROPOSAL. THE FUEL JERRY TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HARVEST WATER BRADFORD BONTA ON IS. WHAT WE REALIZE THIS IS A LARGE INCREASE ON PERCENTAGE BASIS I WOULD NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RUSSELL REGISTRATION FEE IS CURRENTLY THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. AND WOULD REMAIN ONE OF THE LOW SPECIAL REGISTRATION FEES IN THE NATION AT THIS PROPOSALS FOR. WITH THAT I WILL UP HER. ANY QUESTIONS MAY. WRESTLES. THANK YOU FOR THE APRESENTOU ASIAN AND- I HAVE ONE UP A QUICK QUESTION WHAT IS THE RANGE OF FEES AND- OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WELL I DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION I DON'T HAVE THAT MEMORIZED OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT YOU KNOW I THINK. ON THE ON THE LOWEST CALIFORNIA WE'RE YOU KNOW TEN DOLLARS IN IN. OR TWENTY DOLLARS BIANNUALLY I THINK THEY RANGE ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR UP ON THE HIGH END A LOT OF OTHER STATES DO X. YOUR VESSEL REGISTRATION YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE THEIR- THE REVENUE CORPORATE. WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION I'M I'M BEING I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. YOU GREAT THANK YOU- UNLESS THIRDS OF WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION QUESTIONS HERE. THE BIGGEST ONE IS IT'S SUCH A BIG INCREASE THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR WHY HAVEN'T YOU ASKED FOR AN INCREASE OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND NOW ALL OF US WERE ASKING FOR I THINK IT'S LIKE POINT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- THIS IS REALLY THE RESULT OF A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE- RUN EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS ONE AIS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. INCREASES HAVE REALLY- EXACERBATED THE FUNDING BOUNCER LAST FEW YEARS. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAD A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU ARE GAS TAX REVENUE. SO LONG- CERTAINLY AT THE MORE. TRUE MEASURE WOULD BE TO INCREASE THAT HE SLOWLY OVER TIME I THINK- WE'VE HAD A COUPLE SIGNIFICANT FIND. CHANGES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE REALLY EXACERBATED THE SHORTFALL AND SHORTEN THE TIME LINE WHICH IS INCREASING. AND THEN- DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THE FUEL TAX DOLLARS IN A REGISTRATION FEES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE OF H. W. R. F. ACCOUNT. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT DATA. CERTAINLY WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE FUEL TAX REVENUE DATA ON. THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT ACTUALLY DO TRANSFERS THOSE ARE A PERSON TO STAY COOL COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND WE WORK WITH FINANCE VERY CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TRANSFERS ARE MADE APPROPRIATELY IN CONSISTENT WITH. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- YEAH ALL BUDGET ACT REQUIREMENTS. ONE LAST QUESTION IF YOU HAVE A DETAILED LIST OF ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH THE FUNDS. AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A COPY OF THOSE. SURE WE PROVIDE A HARBORS WATERCRAFT BONDS ON REPORT THAT DETAILS ALL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE MADE FROM OUR STATE PARK AND RECREATION FUND THOSE TRANSFERS- WE ALSO HAVE A REPORT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR. OUR PROJECTS FUNDED BY REASON WATER PERFECT BALLING THANK YOU'LL TAX REVENUES- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SB ONE FUEL TAX REVENUES DEPOSITED IN THE SPRING I BELIEVE THERE WAS A BUDGET ACT REQUIREMENTS- COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT SPECIFIED THAT WE WERE TO REPORT ON PROJECTS DONE- PURSUANT TO SB ONE. TO A COUNTRY SO WE. WE CAN. WHY YOU. MISTER BENNETT THANK YOU- AT THE LIGHTS DOWN THE NAM ON. OKAY GREAT THANK BOB. WHAT WE TRIED TO RESEARCH THIS AT AND I COULDN'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER ON IT. BUT A LONG SAME LINES AS- BUT MY COLLEAGUE- IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE- AND YOU MENTIONED YOURSELF THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER TO HAVE STEADY. FEE INCREASES- I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO BE A POLICY- WITH THESE TYPES OF FEES IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH- ONGOING EXPENSES THAT ARE INCREASING YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH- SALARIES BENEFITS XCERRA. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE INCREASING TO GO FIFTEEN YEARS EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT SAY HEY WE HAD THIS HEALTHY RESERVE OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FALL OFF A CLIFF AT SOME POINT TIME FAR BETTER A LONG TERM POLICY TO DO THAT. IS IT POSSIBLE DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SORT TO. REQUEST NEVER LEGISLATURE APPROVED- EFIA INCREASED IT HAS A BUILT IN INFLATION FACTOR IN IT OF SOME SORT. SURE AND I AND I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT IN SOME OF THE OTHER FUEL EXCISE TAX- STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS A LOT OF THOSE ARE TIED TO CPI SO THOSE ACTUALLY PLAYED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. I DON'T THINK CITY I WOULD HAVE- KEPT UP WITH THE RATE OF OUR PROGRAM EXPENDITURE INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF TIME I DID THAT ANALYSIS IT LOOKS LIKE WE WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM ABOUT TEN TO. FIFTEEN DOLLARS WHICH WOULD HAVE CRIED QUITE MAD WHERE WERE UP TO DATE WITH THIS YOU LEVEL INCREASE BUT CERTAINLY SEE GUYS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK TO I TIRE SPECTRUM CREASES TO I THINK THE L. L. IS ALSO SUGGESTED A TRIGGER MECHANISM THAT WOULD- AUTOMATE A FEE INCREASE. DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS- WE ACTUALLY REPORT PROPOSED A SHORT TERM SOLUTION HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH THE BOATING COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS THAT THE DPW COMMISSION AND TRY TO FIND A FEW STRUCTURE THAT WORKS- FOR THOSE FOLKS- AND EXPORTS. OF THE OTHER OPTION WE'VE TALKED. YOUR VESSEL REGISTRY FEES NORMALLY. THE BROADER A AYE S. B. AB THEBODY MAY HAS AS PROPOSED. EXPLAINED BENEFICIARY PAID SMALL FOR QUITE RACES SPECIES WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO. EXPECTORANT RACES ON THIS FUN- AND I THINK THE OTHER FACTOR THAT WOULD BE SOMEONE RUNNING FOR US TO- THE TITLE REGISTRATION FEES NOW. WITHOUT A LONGER TERM SIX DISCUSSION IS WHETHER WE CAN DO THIS THE INCREASES WITH THE N. B. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM HOW HOSTAGE THE SPEAKERS. SO HIS ARE ALL THINGS BETTER- FOR DISCUSSION I THINK AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL BUZZES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO FUND SUSTAINABILITY. DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT SUPPORT GOING TO THAT KIND OF FEE. STRUCTURE IN GENERAL. I DO IT. STRUCTURE OR AND FOR. ADJUSTED FLEECED. STRUCK MAY NOT BE A PLACE ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A- YOU KNOW A- DOLLAR FORTY TO INCREASE BUT YOU. YOU YOU KNOW MAYBE EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS YOU ADJUSTED AND ROUNDED OFF TO THE NEAREST FIVE DOLLARS OR OR WHATEVER. D. GET GET YOUR- SAID THINK CPI MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO OFFSET EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND THE COST OF GETTING CREASES- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WORKING WITH THE BOATING COMMUNITY ON A LONGER TERM INCREASE SO I THINK- THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL REALLY INFORM WORKMAN'S STANCE ON THE CPI. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE L. A. O. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS RACHEL EHLERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AND WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE FEATURES ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU WITH A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. IT'S BALANCED IN THAT IT LOOKS AT BOTH EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AND REVENUE INCREASES WE THINK THAT LOOKING AT INCREASING FEES IS REASONABLE GIVEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN INCREASED AND SO LONG. AND WE THINK THAT THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED ARE WELL TARGETED TO TRY AND MINIMISE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS. THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION IT'LL BE RIGHT BACK BEFORE YOU IN A FEW YEARS AND WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME DIFFICULTIES BOTH FOR YOU AND FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN LOOKING AT. HE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE NOW AND THEN LOOKING AT INCREASING FEES AGAIN IN A FEW YEARS. SO YOU KNOW WEEK WE'VE SUGGEST YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADOPTING A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION NOW AND THERE'S REALLY TWO WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT. THEY CLEANEST WOULD BE TO ADOPT A FULL I'M GOING SOLUTION NOW WITH I'M GOING- THE INCREASES THAT AND EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS THAT COVER THE WHOLE THE WHOLE THING YOU'RE FACING- BUT THAT COULD BE COMPLICATED TO TRY AND PUT TOGETHER IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS PARTICULARLY IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RESTRUCTURING THE FEE. AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED MAYBE LOOKING AT A TIERED SYSTEM OR HAVE BEEN EXPANDING THE FEATURE THOSE WHO ARE PAYING RIGHT NOW LIKE NON MOTORIZED BOAT USERS. ABOUT OWNERS- SO ANOTHER OPTION YOU COULD CONSIDER IS ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SHORT TERM BUT ALSO ADOPTING A SET OF TRIGGER. THE INCREASES AND POTENTIALLY EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AS WELL THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN A FEW YEARS SO DO YOU HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE THAT BACKSTOP. THEY'VE GOT AN ONGOING SOLUTION IN PLACE. BUT IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW TIME FOR THE BOATING COMMUNITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND POTENTIALLY COME FORTH WITH ANOTHER. COMPROMISE ALTERNATIVE TO PRESENT TO YOU THAT YOU COULD PUT IN PLACE- SURE THAT DEVELOPMENT BUT IT GIVES YOU SOME CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'VE GOT A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION IN PLACE IN THE BACKGROUND SHOULD THAT NOT. BE ABLE TO MATERIALIZE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT WE THINK THINKING ABOUT A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION. MIGHT MAKE SENSE IN THIS CASE. FOR YOU A THAT MA'AM OF THE WHO ARE. GOING TO GIVE UP PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING MAY WANT TO. WEIGH IN ON SOME OF THOSE OPTIONS I KNOW THERE'S- A GOOD DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE- BOATING COMMUNITY ON- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MIKE MCGINNIS FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE APPRECIATE THE- ALEJO'S REMARKS ON THE- THE SUBJECT THE AT THE WORK THAT ON THIS BUT THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL AS SUBMITTED RATHER THAN BUILDING IN NAY AT TRIGGER MECHANISM ARE A LONG TERM SOLUTION AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO ALLOW TIME TO WORK WITH THE BOATING COMMUNITY AS- DISCUSSED BY THE- SHE- THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND- FLIP SIDE OF IT THERE'S NO UP ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. THE A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RELEVANCY IN HISTORY PROGRAM.

OFTEN WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE PARTICULAR ISSUE AND- PENDING THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. THE CATCH ALL CATEGORY FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS.

AND YES WE ARE HERE WHAT ARE PROPOSAL HERE FOR THE EMBER RESISTANT SOUND WEIRD- WITH- OBVIOUSLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN IN RECENT YEARS THE- THE IMPORTANCE OF STRUCTURAL HARDING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE. HAS BECOME EVER MORE. OBVIOUS AND URGENT AND SO THIS PROGRAM WOULD GIVE US GIVE STATE PARKS A DEDICATED RESOURCE TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND AN ONGOING BASIS. UP WE BELIEVE UNDER THIS PROVISION WE'D BE ABLE TO TREAT BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED STRUCTURES PER YEAR. OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THAT ARE IN THE VERY HIGH END HIGH FIRE RISK IS OWN CATEGORIES. THANK YOU LMAO COMMENTS. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL I THINK WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO DO WITH THESE FUNDS REALLY GOES BEYOND JUST IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB THIRTY EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF THAT ZONE AROUND THE PROPERTIES BUT DEFENSIBLE SPACE MORE GENERALLY BUT WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE AND IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERTAKE. THANK YOU THE PART IN THE FINANCE. NO COMMENTS. THANK YOU- UNDERSCORING THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM IT'S WORTH OBSERVING- THAT- THERE ARE MANY MANY STATE PARKS THAT FALL WITHIN HIGH FIRE ZONE AREAS AND TO- SO LET THIS ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PROTECTION THAT- WILL BE FORWARDED TO A TO THE PARKS AND MANY OF THE BUILDINGS IN THE PARK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MISTER BENNETT DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT YES THANK YOU. AS THE L. A. O- POINTED OUT- THIS ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING TO GO BEYOND JUST A DEFENSIBLE SPACE BUT ALSO TO SORT OF ASSESS THE NEEDS OUT THERE WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE COMING BACK TO US- WELL AND HOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIZE WHAT THE NEXT SET OF NEEDS ARE IN TERMS OF- DEFENDING OR AN IMPROVING FIRE. PROJECT PREVENTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE PROBLEM IS EXTENSIVE AND WE AND OUR IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS TO BE ITERATIVE. I THINK WITH THE- WITH THE NESTED PROPOSALS OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BOTH. IMPLEMENTATION AND SIMULTANEOUS MONITORING OF THE EFFICACY OF THAT WORK AND I DO BELIEVE WE HAD TO SEPARATE BEING ABLE TO RETURN- IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY. THANK YOU. SMITH FRIEDMAN. HAPPY TO SEE THIS ITEM- IN FRONT OF THIS BODY IN THE BUDGET. I JUST HAVE A QUICK COMMENT WHICH IS THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE THREE AGENCIES HERE CAL FIRE. A STATE PARKS THE ON THE BOARD OF FORESTRY ALL WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE GUIDELINES FOR THE ZONE HAVEN'T BEEN. DESIGNED YET COMPLETELY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER WORK IS DONE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE GOING TO BE IN SO THAT THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE IN COMMUNICATION ABOUT. WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL LOOK LIKE AND ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIRECTING HOMEOWNERS. AND PROPERTY OWNERS AT TO DO. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT. THANK YOU. GREAT TO. THANK YOU AND THE- THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE WILL. MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTATION WHICH IS- ISSUE FIVE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. ALL. THANK YOU TERRIBLE. I AM WEARING GOLD AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CDC AND SHOULD MODERN TECHNOLOGY FAIL US MY BACK UP FOR THE HEARING STEVE GOLD BACK PART. SIMPLY PUT I URGE YOU TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE CONTINUES FOR THREE YEARS BC DC'S AUTHORIZE USE OF THE BAY FEEL CLEAN UP AND ABATEMENT FUND. TO PAY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT MANAGER AND ENFORCEMENT TURKEY'S. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNDING OF THESE TWO POSITIONS THROUGH THE BAY FILL FOUGHT. AND THAT AUTHORIZATION NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED EVERY THREE YEARS DUE TO THE VARIABILITY OF THE FUNDS REVENUE STREAM. THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL FOR THE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE TO FULFILL ITS STATUTORY ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER ADDRESSING FINDINGS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR ON THE COMMISSION'S ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. AND TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT ACTIONS IDENTIFIED IN AB TWENTY EIGHT OH NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN. ABSENT USING THE BAY FEEL CLEAN UP AN ABATEMENT FUND TO FUND ENFORCEMENT STAFF THE CDC WOULD HAVE TO RE DIRECT CRITICAL PERMITTING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. AND WITHOUT THESE TWO LEADERS THE CDC NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIX AND ANY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AND CREATE OUR NEW IMPROVED ONE. THE CDC'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS WERE SCATTERSHOT. INDIVIDUALS AND THE AUDIT THAT WAS PUBLISHED JUST AS WE WERE HIRING THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS CORRECTLY NOTED THAT THE CDC'S EFFORTS DID NOT MEASURE UP TO THE NEEDS OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY. THE COMMISSION AND OUR STAFF SAID PUBLICLY AT THAT TIME THAT WE APPRECIATED THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE AUDITOR DIRECTED TOWARD THE CDC. FOUR MONTHS AGO THE CDC PROVIDED YOU WITH AN UPDATE ON THE COMMISSION'S TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WHICH IS DUE IN GREAT PART TO THE LEADERSHIP PROVIDED BY THE ENFORCEMENT MANAGER AND DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY. WHO ARE PAID BY THE BAY FEEL MONTHS DAY IN OUR COMMISSIONS ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED A SERIES OF REGULATORY POLICY AND PRACTICE CHANGES THAT PROMOTE DETERRENCE. AND ENSURE TRANSPARENT CONSISTENT AND FAIR APPROACH TO ALL ENFORCEMENT CASES THESE CHANGES INCLUDE WHOLESALE OR PARTIAL ADOPTION OF ALMOST ALL OF THE AUDIT'S RECOMMENDATIONS DIRECTED TO DC DC. THE ENFORCEMENT TEAM IS ADOPTED SPECIFIC WRITTEN PROCEDURES EFFECTIVELY TRACKS CASES RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS REPORTED IN A TIMELY WAY AND HAS DEVELOPED CASE RESOLUTION MILESTONES ALL OF WHICH WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH PUBLIC PROCESSES. THE COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE SCHOOL PILOT PENALTY POLICY OUR OLDEST CASES ARE BEING RESOLVED IN OUR CASE PRIORITY SYSTEM HAS BEEN MADE LESS COMPLEX THE COMMISSION IS RECEIVING QUARTERLY UPDATES ON PROGRAMS PROGRESS. REGARDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS AB TWENTY EIGHT OH NINE. OUR ENFORCEMENT TEAM HAS IMPLEMENTED WRITTEN CASE REVIEW PROCEDURES THAT DEFINE WHO HOW AND WHEN MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ENFORCEMENT STAFF DECISIONS IN ADDITION WRITTEN CASE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES SPECIFY TIME FRAMES WITHIN WHICH ENFORCEMENT CASES NEED TO BE RESOLVED FURTHER THE CDC'S NEW ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTY POLICY INCLUDES A MATRIX TO CALCULATE CIVIL PENALTIES IT INCORPORATES HOW BC DC WILL ASSESS MULTIPLE VIOLATION PENALTIES BY TYPE OF VIOLATION. BOTH THE BILL CONSISTENT SCENE ENABLE TRANSPARENCY SO LET ME PROVIDE YOU WITH JUST A FEW STATISTICS DURING THE PAST CALENDAR YEAR THE NUMBER OF PENDING ENFORCEMENT CASES HAS DROPPED FROM. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR TO TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN. THE NUMBER OF OUR OLDEST CASES HAS DROPPED BY HALF. THREE TIMES MORE CASES WERE CLOSED IN TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN. MOST IMPORTANT ONE THIRD OF ALL PENDING CASES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED OR IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RESOLVED. I WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVE OCCURRED WHILE THE ENFORCEMENT STAFF AND COMMISSIONS ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE EXTENDED AMEND THIS EFFORT TO CREATE VIRTUALLY A NEW PROGRAM. NOW THAT MOST OF THE NECESSARY PROCESS CHANGES HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WE FORECAST THAT MORE ENFORCEMENT CASES WILL BE TAKEN UP AND RESOLVED WHICH WE HOPE WILL DETER FUTURE VIOLATIONS. BUT WE COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THESE SUCCESSES WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT MANAGER AND ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO APPROVED WITHOUT THEIR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PERMITTING T. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO ADOPT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR- NOTING THAT THE OUR STAFF. FIVE COMMENTS THAT THE PROPOSAL. AND TRAILER BILL DIRECTLY UNDER CUT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS EFFORTS AND THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION- I BELIEVE FOR A- MISTER MARLAND IS AVAILABLE REMOTELY AND WISHES TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS MR MILLER ARE YOU THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU'RE ON MUTE I'M TOLD. AREA AT THE VERY HIGH ENERGY TELL SOMEBODY ELSE MUTED ME JUST FOR THE RECORD. I DO NOT KNOW HAS. OKAY AND CAN GRANT MISTER CHAIR TO ROUTE FORTY TWO OH TWO AGAIN I WISH I COULD BE WITH ALL OF YOU IN PERSON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE JUST A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS AND THANK YOU TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GOLD BANDS WHO HAS MADE A EXCELLENT PROGRESS YET I AM CONCERNED THAT ONCE AGAIN THAT B. C. B. C. BUDGET PRESENTED TODAY ALLOWS THE CONTINUED USE OF THE BAY FELL CLEAN UP IN A BAY EVEN FIND TO FIND. ENFORCEMENT STAFF SALARIES FOR MEMBERS- BENEFIT THIS IS THE FUN WERE FINES AND PENALTIES COLLECTED THROUGH B. C. B. S.'S ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY ARE DEPOSITED. AS BACKGROUND I CALL THIS ISSUE OUT OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROCESS. D. O. F. PROPOSED THEN AS IT HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THE SAME APPROACH I'M TROUBLED THAT WERE BEING ASKED ONCE AGAIN TO APPROVE ENFORCEMENT STAFF FUNDING BY AND- BY USING ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDS. ESSENTIALLY STAFF WOULD BE TASKED WITH GENERATING THEIR OWN SALARIES. THIS IS A CANNED HIRING MORE POLICE OFFICERS BY ISSUE A WARRANT CITATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORY HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE STEPS YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT LEGISLATION I AUTHORED WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF A BIPARTISAN. STATE AUDIT IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF ISSUES AROUND THE CDC'S ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY AND YOU HEARD THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AND I APPLAUD THE COMMISSION. I APPLAUD THE EXECUTIVE YET I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PERVERSE INCENTIVES ON HOW THIS FUND IS BEING YOU IS ONE OF THE AUDITORS KEY RECOMMENDATIONS. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CLARIFY THE INTENDED USE OF THE BAY FEEL CLEAN UP IN A BAY EVEN FINANCE FOR THE PHYSICAL CLEAN UP OF THE BAY. RATHER THAN ENFORCEMENT STAFF SALARIES I'M TROUBLED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FULLY AWARE OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS IS MOVING. IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WE PROPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT CODIFIES THAT EXISTING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE ELIGIBLE USED TO THE BAY FELT CLEAN UP AN ABATEMENT FUND. IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS SERIOUS ABOUT TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE. THEN OUR RESOURCE TO AGENCIES NEED TO BE PROPERLY FUNDED AND STAFFED. AND I SAY THIS WITH THE NIGHT OF THE FUTURE WE NEED B. C. D. C. AS A TRUSTED. AND RESPECTED REGULATORY PARTNER THE ISSUE FOR OUR GENERATION IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOR B. C. B. C.'S PURPOSES SEALEVEL RISE. AS ONE OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE TO ADDRESS THE LEVEL RISE B. CDC NEEDS TO BE ON SOLID FOOTING MOVING FORWARD I AM PLEASED. WITH THE WORK THE CDC HAS UNDERTAKEN TO BRACE THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS OF BELIEVE THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS STABILITY IN ITS RESOURCES. AND TO THAT END I PLAN ON ADVOCATING FOR THESE ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS- THAT THEY BE FUNDED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE I BELIEVE WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RAP- AVAILABLE. AND REALLY IT'S JUST- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT PROCESS. AROUND THE USE OF THIS FIGHT AND- TO FUNDS- STAFF SALARIES AND ARE THERE OTHER STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES. THAT HAVE THIS MODEL BILL TEN USING PENALTIES TO FIND STAFF. DO WE HAVE- EXAMPLES OF THAT IN IN STATE GOVERNMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS MARION KAPLAN WITH FINANCE. I. SO TO ADDRESS YOUR TWO PART QUESTION. AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF DEPARTMENTS USING SPECIAL FUNDS TO FIND ENFORCEMENT I WILL POINT YOU TO. FILMATION'S I USED OF THE VIOLATIONS THAT'S HOW. AT OF THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY FIND AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE ISSUES AT THAT POSITION GAME PRESERVATION PATENT. I COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT THE OTHER PIECE OF YOUR- WELL WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALLOWING THE USE OF THE ENGAGEMENT FIND FOR ENFORCEMENT STAFF. STOP ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT USE OF THE BAY FELT CLEAN AND ABATEMENT FIND FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IS- OUR INTERPRETATION OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIX SIX SIX FOUR ONE POINT NINE THAT- IDENTIFIES. COSTS SHOULD BE RECOUPED- WITHIN THAT I THAN MEANT. OF THAT FINES AND FEES. OKAY I'M GOING TO REITERATE MY OPPOSITION TO THIS TYPE OF FINANCING FOR REGULATORY AGENCIES AND WOULD SUGGEST THAT FORMER FINANCE HE- THE AUDITORS. APARTMENT THE RESULTS OF THE- AUDITORS RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S NOT GOOD GOVERNMENT IT FURTHER ERODES TRUST AND- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CDC HAS FULL PUBLIC TRUST MOVING FORWARD JUST A FINAL COMMENT- MISTER CHAIR AND THEN I'LL LET THIS ISSUE GO AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE L. F. AND- OUR PARTNERS ON THE SENATE SIDE AS WELL ON THIS- RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FRANKLY. OFFER THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT IS BEING DONE- BUT LAST YEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE WHEN ALL STATE AGENCY BUDGETS EITHER WORST THINK FLATTER REDUCE THE CDC'S BUDGET- ACTUALLY WENT UP BY SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE. THOUSAND DOLLARS I LATER LEARNED THAT AMOUNT WAS SETTLED- FOR A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT LAWSUIT THAT B. C. B. C. LOST APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND OF THAT. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR THEIR COSTS AT APPROXIMATELY 300-402-0002 PAY FOR THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY. THE STATE AUDITS ESTIMATED COST WAS JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDING THAT THE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE PIER A LOSS HE BRINGS US CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDS HAD BEEN SPENT SO FAR AS A RESULT OF THIS ABATEMENT FIND ISSUE. ADD TO THAT THE NUMBER OF THE CDC STAFF HOURS AT LEGISLATIVE STAFF OUR SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO TRYING TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE A CASE OF BEING PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH I'LL BE ADVOCATING. FUNDING THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. FOR MUCH FOR. YOUR YOUR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL I DON'T THINK WE HEARD FROM ALEJO LET'S MAKE SURE WE HEAR FROM LA- AND TO. THANK YOU WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER BENNETT JUST WANTED THEM I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLINS COMMENTED- IT. RAISES THE ISSUE OF TRUST- HI I THINK IF WE'VE SEEN REPEATEDLY WHEN PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THE FINE IS GOING TO FUND THE POSITION THERE'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST- IN TERMS OF ANALYZING WHETHER THERE IS A VIOLATION OR NOT AND WHAT THE FINE SHOULD BE SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A WISE- INVESTMENT ON OUR PART TO TRY TO BUILD THAT KIND OF TRUST- BY ELIMINATING THAT KIND OF CONFLICT. THANK YOU. SANTA WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WE ARE WITH. THE ENTIRE AGENDA TODAY AND I HOPE WHEN THIS COMES BACK. APSE WILL OF- BE ABLE TO HEAR OF A MORE DEFINITIVE PLAN FOR HOW THE- A B. C. D. C. CAN MOVE FORWARD- IN A WAY. THAT- ADDRESSES THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN HAS RAISED. STAFF THERE SAID NOTHING FURTHER WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT COME FIRST CONSERVATION CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE IF.

INITIALLY APPROVED IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN FOR UNLIMITED TERM. IF YOU'RE A PC PC TO MAKE DECISIONS IRMA. NO POSITION ACCORDING REQUEST AS THAT GRANT BACK IN YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT MAY HAVE HELPED HOW JAM CONTINUE TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S AND LEGISLATURE'S OBJECTIVES FOR MAINTAINING PROGRESS TOWARD IMPROVED OVERSIGHT OIL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. REJECTED PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST REGULATORY STANDARDS IN THE COUNTRY. THE CAPACITY ADDED THREE THESE POSITIONS HELPS CAL JAM IN PAIN STRONG FIELD PRESENTS FOR INCREASED INSPECTION ENFORCEMENT.

MAKING IT PETITIONS PERMANENTLY WILL HELP COUNTY I'M SUSTAIN THIS PROGRESS. GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. MISTER SMITH HAS A QUESTION THANK YOU- IN REGARDS TO THE EMPLOYEES OF- BCP CLAIMS pOF A TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS OR AUTHORIZED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT YOU'VE ONLY HIRED FOR. AND THEY'RE STILL TWENTY ONE VACANCIES BUT NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR I THINK ANOTHER TWENTY ONE POSITIONS IS THAT THE SAME TWENTY ONE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HIRED FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

I THE REQUESTED FOUR MILLION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS FOR THE SAME SCOPE OF WORK OUTLINED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IT'S JAMES. OF THE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS APPROVED. LAST YEAR ONLY FOUR HAVE BEEN HIRED. SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE FREE MONEY FOR THOSE POSITIONS AND WHY DO THEY WHY DO YOU NEED TWENTY. SIX MORE WHEN YOU'VE ONLY. HEARD FOR IN OTHER WORDS. THAT THAT THOSE WHO ARE PAYING FOR YOUR OPERATION. WITH THEIR FEET. HAVE PUT UP SUBSTANTIAL NEW. RESOURCES. AND YET YOU ONLY HIRED FOR. I GUESS. BACK IN THE MONEY SOMEWHERE MR PATTERSON- AND THAT ISSUE IS ISSUE SEVEN- WORK CURRENTLY ON ISSUE SIX I THINK WE'LL BE MOVING UP PRETTY QUICKLY IT IS ONEROUS YOU SEVEN SO IF YOU COULD HOLD TO YOUR QUESTION- AND A BAND FOR JUST A MOMENT. TO I'M DO THAT BUT I WAS GIVEN A CONTEXT TO THE- YOU SEE ARE YOU I SEE PERMITS BUT I'LL I'LL I'LL DO THAT OKAY WELL WE CAN YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL MS FRIEDMAN- YOU'LL LET ME KNOW IF- YOU ONE INTERJECT QUESTION NOW BUT MAYBE WE CAN MOVE THROUGH ALL.

IT ON TO ISSUE SEVEN AND EIGHT. AND OKAY GREAT. CERTAINLY YES ALL MOVE ON ISSUE SEVEN. I'M SO ISSUE SEVEN IS THE PROPOSAL ALSO FOR GALGIANI. I REQUEST TEAM TWENTY SIX POSITIONS ON THE BASELINE INCREASE OF JUST OVER FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS. AND IT WILL BE PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS. THE LIKE THE FIRST PROPOSAL THIS ONE ALSO HELPS CAL JAM CONTINUE TRANSFORMING ITS MISSION TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS UNDER THE- DIRECTION OF SUPERVISOR TOOK HOW YOUNG HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THIS TRANSFORMATION. HOWEVER THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. THE PROPOSAL WELL AS CISCO GERMAN CONTINUING ON THAT PATH. PLEASE THIS PROPOSAL WELL INCREASED STAFF PRESENCE IN THE FIELD TO PERFORM INSPECTIONS. AND CONTINUE THE QUEST TO WITNESS ALL OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE TAKING PLACE AT CRITICAL WELL SITES. AND NEAR SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. THIS INCLUDES ALSO COLLECTING INFORMATION AND GIS DATA. FOR RELATED FACILITIES AND PIPELINES. THE WOULD ALL ALLOW TO CONTAIN IMPLEMENTATION OF AT FIVE FIFTY ONE. AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN AND ENSURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IS IN PLACE SO THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE TO ASSUME LIABILITY FOR ORPHANED OR ABANDONED WELL RELATED FACILITY. THE PROPOSAL HELPS ENSURE IDYLLWILD MANAGEMENT PLANS. ARE SUBMITTED IN A TIMELY AND ACCURATE MANNER STRAIGHT HELLO JIM HORSEMEN PROGRAM INCLUDING ISSUE ONCE OF ENFORCEMENT ORDERS FROM THE SUPERVISOR OR THE PROPOSAL HELPS DEVELOP PRIORITIES TO PLUG AND ABANDON WELLSITE INDEPENDENT. WRESTLING DEREK. SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. THE PROPOSAL ALSO TRêN THROUGH INCREASED DATA INTEGRITY AND SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RULE MAKING PROCESS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AS WELL AS FUEL FUTURE RULEMAKING. AND FINALLY THIS PROPOSAL HELPED IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO DECARBONISE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS IS A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION THAT CONSISTS OF TWELVE POSITIONS IN YOUR ONE. TEN PHYSICIANS IN YEAR TWO AND FOUR POSITIONS IN THE FINAL YEAR. WE DECIDED TO TAKE A MORE MEASURED APPROACH WITH THIS PROPOSAL DUE TO THE CONTINUING ECONOMIC STRUGGLES RESULTING FROM THE COPE WITH PANDEMIC. ANOTHER THEATER CRITICAL POSITIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF CAL JAM. I WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT. ISSUE RELATED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OR CDS. THIS IS PERFECT FOR POSITION AND A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM INCREASE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE STRONG MOTION INSTRUMENTATION AND SEISMIC HAZARDS MAPPING FONG. THE REQUESTED FOR A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM WITHIN CGS TO DEVELOP THREE DIMENSIONAL SUBSURFACE GEOLOGIC MAPPING WHICH WILL HELP THE STATE WITH SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROJECTS. THE FIRST IS SEISMIC MAPPING OF FAULTS AND FAULT CONDITIONS THIS WILL HELP YOU EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR GROUND MOTION WHICH IS THE FORMATION LANDSLIDES AND LIQUEFACTION. AND HOW THAT MANIFESTS POTENTIALLY IN RISKS TO BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES. WELL ALSO FROM GROUND WATER RECHARGE MAPPING ENHANCEMENTS TO SUPPORT SICK MY IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT AQUIFER CONDITIONS AND THEIR CAPACITY AND QUALITY IN THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR RECHARGE. THE MAPPING EFFORT WOULD PROVIDE MINERAL RESOURCE EVALUATIONS LOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM AGGREGATE WHICH IS LITERALLY THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES JUST REPEATED MINERALS NEEDED FOR HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES ENERGY RESOURCE EVALUATIONS TO GENERATE MAPS OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS TO HELP GET THE STATE ON PAR WITH THE IDEA THAT THE INDUSTRY USE THAT. AND HELP BUT BETTER EVALUATE PROJECT PROPOSALS LOOKING AT KEY FACTORS SUCH AS SEISMIC RISK OR- IMPACT THE AQUIFER'S. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS WE SEE MORE PLUGGING AND ABANDONING OF WELLS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT IS DONE THE STATE MATTER. THE OTHER COMPONENT TO THE ENERGY PORTFOLIO IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO LOOK AT I'M WAY TO ENHANCE THE EVALUATIONS OF THAT. OF THE GEO THERMAL OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY THIS TYPE OF MAPPING CAN ALSO BE USED TO ASSESS CARBON STORAGE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR DEEP STORAGE OF CAPTURED CARBON IN CALIFORNIA. AND HELPING US MEET THE RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY RIGHT TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THESE MAPS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENCE WE DON'T HAVE TODAY IN CAN BE UTILIZED BY MANY STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. CALTRANS HELLFIRE AND HELLO YES. THESE MAPS GIVE ALL OF THE AGENCIES A COMMON PLATFORM TO COLLABORATE ON IMPORTANT STATE ISSUES. HI THIS BECAUSE MY PRESENTATIONS AND I'M I'M GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY OF YOUR SHOTS. THANK YOU SO WELL LET'S RETURN TO OUR MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU THANK WAS CHAIR OF. AND LET ME SET THIS UP IN THE AGAIN. YOUR YOU'RE REQUESTING FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION PHASE IN OVER THREE YEARS FOR TWENTY SIX NEW POSITIONS THE REQUESTED FOUR MILLION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY FIVE NEW POSITIONS A CENTURY THE SAME SCOPE OF WORK OUTLINED THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THE TWENTY FIVE POSITION APPROVED LAST YEAR ONLY FOUR HAVE BEEN HIGHER. SO I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU COMING. WITH ADDITIONAL REQUEST THESE. OPERATIONS IN THESE PERMIT HOLDERS. FOR THESE ADDITIONAL. THE POSITIONS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THIS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. CALTRANS BUDGET HAS NEARLY TRIPLED. YEP PERMIT DELAYS ARE WORSE THAN ANYONE. SINCE TWENTY NINE. ONLY ONE UNDERGROUND INJECTION PERMIT HAS BEEN. UNDERSTAND YOU WERE SITTING ON SIXTEEN YOU ICE. SO FIRST OF ALL WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH RESOURCES. IF YOU DID NOT HIGHER ON THOSE TWENTY FIVE YOU WANT TO KIND. AND SECONDLY WHAT IS TAKING. TO I SEE PERMITS. ALL OF THIS BY THE WAY FOR BY THOSE WHO ARE IN. THAT THE BUSINESS OF PURPA PROVIDING ENERGY AND SO WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS PAYING EVER INCREASING FEES FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE SLOW OR NON EXISTENT PROCESSING WHAT'S TAKEN SO LONG. WELL FIRST OF ALL ON YOUR QUESTION REGARDING THE HIRING AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- WE HAVE BASICALLY TAKEN AND- APPLICATIONS FOR ALL OF THE POSITIONS BECAUSE TEENS HAVE CLOSED- AND AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE HIRED FOR BUT WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF SCORING THOSE THOSE APPLICATIONS. FROM THOSE CANDIDATES AND WE WILL BEGIN INTERVIEWING INTERVIEWING FOR THOSE POSITIONS YEAH SO YES WE WILL ADMIT THAT WE WERE A LITTLE SLOW OUT OF THE GATE- HIRING THOSE POSITIONS- YOU KNOW WE HAD TO PAUSE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT YEAH IN IN THE COBIT ENVIRONMENT IN THE IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. I PARTICULARLY ONBOARDING STAFF THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF TRAINING- WHEN WE SAW THAT THAT- THAT. ACTUATION WAS NOT FOR TO GET ANY SO. WE NEED TO DO FORWARD AND SO WE GET- AND SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. ARE IN THOSE POSITIONS- AND HOPE TO HAVE THOSE BUILT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- REGARDING THAT THEY YOU'RE RIGHT FOR MATT- I CAN SAY IT AT A HIGH LEVEL AND I MEAN I'LL ET YOU PROVIDER. OKAY AT ANY DETAILS- NEED AT- HAVE BEEN GOING. THROUGH A PROCESS OF TRYING TO A- HOW WE CAN WE CAN GET BETTER THAT. I SEVENTEEN. NEXT TO ME SURE THAT THEY MEET REGULATORY- WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS- TO EVALUATE- HOW ARE OUR- OUR FUNCTIONS ARE WORKING AND THROUGH THAT THROUGH THAT EVALUATION WE HAVE COME OUT THE BACK AND STARTING TO ISSUE PERMITS AGAIN- WITH A LOT A HIGHER LEVEL OF SCRUTINY. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ARE. WE ARE ISSUING THOSE PERMITS AT THE HIGHEST HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTEGRITY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. WELL CREATE THE ANSWER- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE ITEM FOR ME AND FOR THOSE IN OUR ARMED AREA OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE IN- THE WORK OF ENERGY- THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PAYING. YOUR YOUR YOUR BUDGET. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT REASONABLE AND TIMELY PERMITTING AS A PROCEDURAL RIGHT- AND IT APPEARS. THAT THEY CONTINUE TO PAY HIGHER FEES. AND CONTINUE TO SEE A SLOWING. OF THE ACTUAL DUE PROCESS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO I DON'T THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY- NOBLE TO ESSENTIALLY USE THE BUREAUCRATIC OPERATION TAKE FROM THOSE THAT ARE SEEKING THE PERMIT. AND ESSENTIALLY SAYING NO. YOU'RE SITTING ON SIXTY YOU I SEE PERMITS. THAT TO ME A LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE USING THE OPERATION. TO SAY NO FOUR WAIT OR MAYBE INSTEAD OF GETTING TO A YES IT IS TOO SLOW AND IT IS CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE I THINK TO THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE ITS OWN ENERGY. THANK MISTER. MS FRIEDMAN AND THEN- ALL RIGHT MISS REAVIS. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE A TARGET DATE ON WHEN YOU EXPECT THESE POSITIONS TO BE FILLED THIS YEAR- AND HAS ISSUED A RECRUITMENT ISSUE AS FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT OR YOU KNOW WHY WHY WAS THERE A DELAY WITH FILLING THESE POSITIONS. I THINK PROVIDING A TARGET DATE IS A LITTLE TREACHEROUS- IT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON- HOW THE ACTUAL INTERVIEW PROCESS GOES THE EVALUATION OF THE OF THE APPLICATIONS- AND YOU KNOW WHETHER SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS WILL NEED TO BE- REPOSTED- SO. WHAT I CAN SAY THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO PROCESS THOSE APPLICATIONS AND DO OUR INTERVIEWS AND SCORING- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- AND WE WILL FILL THOSE POSITIONS- OVER YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT NUMBER OF MONTHS-BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHEN WE WILL BE DONE FILLING THOSE POSITIONS- IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT- WEEK WE ARE RECEIVING- APPLICATIONS- AND WE ARE TRYING TO CAST A WIDE NET TO WHERE WE POST THESE POSITIONS. AND SO YOU KNOW RECRUITMENT I THINK IS I WOULDN'T CALL IT A CHALLENGES JUST AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR RECRUITMENT TO TRY TO REACH TO OTHER COMMUNITIES- AND TRY TO DIVERSIFY OUR WORKFORCE- AND SO WE CONTINUE TO MOVE UP THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL. I IN THAT PROCESS OF TRYING TO FILL THESE POSITIONS. AND THEN POSITIONS GOING FORWARD. AND I AM ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU GIVE THAT. YOU WORK IS VERY SPECIALIZED YOU KNOW OR THESE POSITIONS. OF I IMAGINE YOU EXPECT TO RETAIN ONCE YOU HIRE- YOU EXPECT. A RETURN A GOOD RETENTION RATE OR IS THERE ANYTHING. OUT THERE THAT WOULD LEAD YOU NOT TO EXPECT TO RETAIN. AND YOU KNOW THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE INDUSTRY. I THINK THAT'S CORRECT I WE TEND TO KEEP A GOOD RETENTION OF OUR EMPLOYEES- AND CERTAINLY YOU YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT THAT- YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COMPETITOR FOR SOME OF THESE POSITIONS- I'M DONE THE LETTER STATED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE HIRE ARE MAKING A COMMITMENT TO. THE STATE SERVICE- TO IMPLEMENTING THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE LEGISLATURE- AND- THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE MISSION OF CAL JAM- THAT THEY'RE MAKING THAT COMMITMENT AND THEY THEY THEY DO TEND TO STAY ON BOARD FOR A LONG. TIME THANK YOU. MS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU- I WOULD. WHO'S GOING TO JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE HAVING TO DO WITH MR PATTERSON'S QUESTION I'M SORRY THAT HE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WANT TO STICK AROUND TO HEAR THE DISCUSSION. BUT HE MENTIONED THAT- THESE OPERATORS ARE PAYING FOR PERMITS AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET TO A YES ARE THEY ALWAYS GUARANTEED TO GET A YES FOR EVERY SINGLE PERMIT THAT THEY APPLIED FOR IS THAT IS THAT THE GUARANTEE THEY PAY THIS MONEY YOU DO THE REVIEW AND THEY ALWAYS GET THEIR PERMIT. IF THE REVIEW FINDS FALLS. IN IN THEIR- APPLICATION THEN THEY DO NOT GET A PERMIT- SO I WOULD SAY THAT IF THEY DO CONTINUE TO COME BACK WITH IT. THAT'S CORRECT THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO PROCESS THE PERMIT. EVENTUALLY THEY MAY GET THE PERMIT. BUT IT'S NOT GUARANTEED IF THEY CANNOT. PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO TAKE ISSUE THE FROM THAT. SO HIS HIS ARGUMENT THAT. SOME OF THESE OPERATORS ARE IMMEDIATELY GETTING A YES- DOESN'T REALLY. SOUND LIKE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN RIGHT THEY'RE PAYING YOU TO DO A RIGOROUS. REVIEW OF THEIR PERMIT. AND THEN IF THERE. IS CORRECT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. AND IT. CAN BE A- APPROVED UNDER REGULATORY GUIDELINES THEN THEY CAN GET A PERMIT BUT THEY'RE NOT GUARANTEED TO ALWAYS GET A PERMIT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT- THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU- SO I WANTED TO SWITCH TO ASK ABOUT AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WHICH IS ALSO UNDER. YOUR JURISDICTION HOW MANY OPERATOR RISK EVALUATIONS THAT THAT BILL REQUIRED HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS POINT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'LL OUT SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTED TO ANSWER. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY WOMAN- WE CURRENTLY HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE- AND EVALUATION YET THESE ARE THE POSITIONS WERE HIRING- THE TWENTY ONE TO THIS IS THAT OUR- NEAR COMPLETE- WE ALSO- HAVE BEGUN- EVALUATION OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CORPORATION IS THE% FIRST. ENTITY TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT THIS IS A VERY A COMPLEX AND- HELLO PROCESS GO THROUGH THE EVALUATION THAT. BUT WE HAVE NOT COMPLETED ONE YET. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWED FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY OF UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- A TO B. THIS TO BE- PUT UP BY THE OPERATORS ARE HOW MANY OF THE OPERATORS HAVE. HAVE SECURED THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ANY OPERATORS OF SECURED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND BONDING. SB SEVEN TWENTY FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GAVE THE DIVISION THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO PLUG AND ABANDON ORPHAN WELLS FOR THREE YEARS. HAVE HAS A DIVISION BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE THE FULL AMOUNT EACH YEAR AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE TO IDENTIFYING MORE AND MORE OF THESE ABANDONED WELLS AND PLUGGING THEM UP FOR THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. HOW MANY ARE YOU DOING AND OTHER BARRIERS TO DOING MORE OF THEM. YEAH I CAN DO THAT QUESTIONS OF WOMAN- WE CURRENTLY SPEND UP TO THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP TO GET THE EXACT NUMBER WAS OF AN ABANDONED BUT I KNOW THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN- THERE'S A RIGOROUS PROCESS TO CLEAR- WELL ORPHAN- TO ALLOW US TO USE IT. ARE YOU DO YOU STATE FUNDING. THERE ALSO ARE OTHER LIMITATIONS SOMETIMES ON ACCESS TO SITES THAT- THAT MAKE IT CHALLENGING I KNOW- THERE'S A SIDE NORTH L. A. COUNTY THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCESS ROAD AND WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY IT TO REDO THE ROAD BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET A BREAK THEIR TO. ABANDON THE WELLS- SO THERE'S THOSE TYPE OF CHALLENGES BUT WILL HAVE TO GO BACK ON THE SPECIFIC VERSE. OKAY SO HAVE YOU BEEN USING THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE% THREE MILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR OR IS SOME OF THAT MONEY BEING PUT ASIDE FOR COMPLETION. OF THE FUTURE OF THESE X. I BELIEVE. YEAR WE DID SPEND THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR- AND IT DOES ACCUMULATE THERE IN THE IN THE FUND- I BELIEVE WE'RE AT APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIT WAFFEN BUT YOU ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO THAT WHEN YOU STAFF UP AND- ARE YOU ANTICIPATING BEING ABLE TO SORT OF USE MORE OF THAT MONEY MORE QUICKLY NOW AND- COULD. THE PROCESS. OF THIS IMPORTANT WORK. WHAT DO YOU EXPECTMONEY THAT IS CIRCULATING. NO WE DO WE A ANTICIPATE SPENDING THAT MONEY- THAT'S A FOCUS OF OURS IS ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS IN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS LAST SEPTEMBER. WE WANT TO ACCELERATE AN ABANDONED MOR WELLS. OKAY LET'S MOVE OUT TO THE UNDER TO UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROLS- HELLO YOU'VE IMPROVE REGULATIONS IN RECENT YEARS- TO BETTER. REGULATE THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND STIMULATION ACTIVITY. BUT EXISTING PROJECTS DON'T HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER THOSE STRONGER REGULATIONS IT'S ONLY WHEN THEY UNDERGO THEIR ANNUAL REVIEW THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SO I'M WONDERING HOW MANY AT THE U. I SEE PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY HAD THAT IN YOUR REVIEW AND HOW QUICKLY YOU'D EXPECT TO START CYCLING THROUGH THOSE PROJECTS TO ENACT THE STRONGER REGULATIONS. I MEAN A WEEK DOZENS OF YEARS AWAY AFTER YEARS AWAY WHEN DID THEY START GETTING KIND OF LOSING THEIR- GRANDFATHER DENNIS FOR THE WEAKER REGULATIONS AND START TRANSITIONING. YES IT NEW YOU I SEE REGULATIONS WHEN DEFECTIVE APRIL TWENTY NINETEEN- AND ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PROJECTS GOING FORWARD SO NEW PROJECTS MUST MEET THE NEW REQUIREMENTS- AND THEN. THEY WERE DOING MANUAL PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEW- TO MAKE IT TO MAKE SURE- THAT THEY APPLIED SOME OF THESE. OLDER PROJECTS FROM SAY THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES OR NINETEEN NINETIES ARE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. AND TAKE- QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO GET IN GET IT UP TO THE CURRENT STANDARD SO- WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT I KNOW IN OUR PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEW- THIS PAST YEAR WE COMPLETED EIGHTY. AS FAR AS BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL- SORRY EIGHTY REVIEWS OF ALL PROJECTS OR THE ABUSE NEW OPERATIONS CORRECT. OKAY ALL PROJECTS- BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED AYE AYE I WANT TO IN THE BALLPARK- OF. ABOUT NINE HUNDRED- PROJECTS- SO IT YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT IT JUST ESTIMATING AT THE CURRENT PACE YES WOULD BE SEVERAL YEARS. TO GET THROUGH TO OF ALL THE PROJECTS. THESE NEW POSITIONS- PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE ADDED- THESE DISHES FEEL PRESENCE WILL HELP WITH YOU I SEE PERMITTING REVIEWS- PLUS THE NEW POSITIONS WERE ALSO HIRING FOR RIGHT NOW. WE DID. GO AHEAD SORRY. WE WILL LITTLE LACK I WAS A WEE. NO PROBLEM- WE DID AS WORKLOAD NOW TO YEARS AGO. IT THE ORIGINAL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS- WAS BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL DEFICIT WE HAD AND WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO. AND OUR STAFFING AND SEWER. WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH THE STAFF WE HAVE AND IN THIS IS WHY WE'RE COMING BACK FOR. ADDITIONAL STAFF POSITIONS SO THOSE EIGHTY PROJECTS THAT YOU REVIEWED OUT OF THE NINE HUNDRED PLUS NOW THOSE ONES ARE THOSE PROJECTS ARE SORT OF MOVED UP INTO THAT HIGHER LEVEL OF REVIEW AND REGULATION. SO THEY WERE. THE TERM RATED THEY'VE THEY'VE V. FOR THE CORRECT STAND ONE OF. APRIL OF TWENTY NINE. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION- IS ABOUT CYCLIC STEAM INJECTION SO AFTER THE CIMAREX. OIL SPILL- WE HAVE- YOU'RE REVIEWING SOME OF THE CYCLIC STEAM PROJECTS TO JUST MAKE SURETHAT WE DON'T HAVE A REPEAT OF THAT OIL SPILL. HOW IS MY IS THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND I'M WONDERING HOW MANY OF THOSE REVIEWS OF CURRENT CYCLIC STEAMING. UP PROJECTS HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO UNDERGO HOW MANY OF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A MORATORIUM ON HIGH PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAMING. THAT WAS THE TYPE OF OPERATION THAT WAS OCCURRING IN SOME REC FOR NUMBER NEW NEW OPERATIONS RIGHT WHAT ABOUT I'M ASKING ABOUT REVIEWING- ONGOING OPERATIONS ARE YOU DOING REVIEWS OF ANY OF THOSE. SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON LARGELY MORE NATIONAL LAB ON REVIEWING. CURRENT OPERATIONS- THERE'S- FORTHCOMING REPORT THAT- WILL ASSESS THAT AND THAT THAT REVIEWED ALL ALL OPERATIONS IN STATE. AS I REVIEW A SORT OF A HYPOTHETICAL REVIEW OR IS THAT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SPECIFIC- WELLS. IT'S LOOKING AT SPECIFIC- OPERATORS WELLS GEOLOGY- OF CURRENT OPERATIONS IN THE STATE IS NOT A THEORETICAL RIGHT SO IT'LL COME OUT AND REVIEW THE RISK FOR ALL OF THE CURRENT- WELLS THAT ARE USING CYCLIC STEAMING. SEVEN KIND CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU YEAH WE MET WITH- OKAY I APPRECIATE YOUR- QUESTION A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT REPORT WILL BE.

TO CONSIDER TO MAKE THIS PROPOSAL REASONABLE AND FAIR THE MAIN ISSUES THAT WE ADDRESS OUR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A PERCENT INCREASE THAT'S MUCH LARGER THAN ACOSTA LEVY INCREASE. AND THE EXPLANATION THAT IS GIVEN IS THAT THAT THE STAFF INCREASES ARE FOR PROGRAM SAID BARELY IF AT ALL BENEFIT BORDERS PRIMARILY SO. THE BEACH EROSION PROGRAM WAS EMPHASIZED AS A REASON FOR THE CALL FOR THE STAFF INCREASED THE INVASIVE SPECIES PROGRAM THAT HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY AND- BENEFITS MUCH MORE THAN JUST VOTERS AUTHOR ON THE WATERWAYS AND ON OUR WATERWAYS SECOND IS. THE CONTEXT THE FREE INCREASE IS LOOKED AT AS JUST A FREE INCREASE AND IT IGNORES THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND VOTER FUEL TAX DOLLARS. MUCH MORE WHICH USED TO BE DEPOSITED THERE WILL POPPING FUN INSTEAD. IT'S BEING DIRECTED OVER TO STATE PARKS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE STATE PARKS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SOME OF WHICH HAVE TENDED TO SOMEBODY TO BOATERS. SO ONLY PAID AT THE STATE.

A GOOD TASTE IN OUR MOUTHS A STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF BEING LISTENED TO AND BEING ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS. YOU ASKED FOR OUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR ON WHAT THE L. A. O.

WE HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AT THEIR RATE OF ONBOARDING THAT THEY WILL GET THE ENTIRE BEFORE THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR I'D LIKE TO KNOW TO THE CAL JIM HAS HAD A CHRONIC VACANCY RATE OVER THE LAST SIX BUDGET CYCLE OF ABOUT 17% CURRENTLY CAL CHEN HAS ABOUT SIXTY VACANCIES. WHICH IS OVER 18% AS BY WAY OF A VACANCY RATE THEY DO NOT NEED MORE STAFF AT THIS TIME- WHEN THEY ARE OPERATIONALLY DEFICIENT AT 20% THE RETENTION AS IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY A MEMBER EARLIER IS NOT GOOD. ALSO CONCERNING TO US IS THE CALCIUM HAS LOANED OUT THIRTEEN FULL TIME STAFF POSITIONS YOU CODED CONTACT TRACING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS AT A COST TO OUR OIL PRODUCERS OF OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE SINCE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OIL AND GAS OVERSIGHT.

PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC ACCESS AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO HELPS THE STATE AND LOCALS DRAWDOWN AGAINST FEDERAL DOLLARS. IN ENCINITAS SOLANA BEACH FOR EXAMPLE THE PROJECT THERE THE STATE HAS ALREADY INVESTED TWO POINT SEVEN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PROJECT THAT'S SUPPOSE TO BEGIN IN A YEAR. THAT IS DRAWN DOWN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS- LOCAL DOLLARS.

W. I. TO GET. INFORMATION ON WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING AND WHAT THE STATUS WAS AND WE DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE- BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR THE SENATE- SUBCOMMITTEE- THAT IS AN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE PAY IN FUEL TAXES AND WE ONLY GET FIFTEEN MILLION BACK. THIS INFORMATION IS ALARMING AND CONFIRMS OUR SUSPICION THAT BOATERS FUEL TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING STEADILY AND INCREASINGLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM H. W. R. F. INTO STATE GENERAL FUND. AND FUNDS IN THE STATE PARKS- THE TIMING OF THIS- TO A 50% INCREASE COULD NOT BE WORSE DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED. UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE FINDING OUTDOOR ON THE WATER RECREATION BE SAFE AND ENJOYABLE ACTIVITY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS IN TWENTY TWENTY. THERE WAS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BOTH PURCHASED AND REGISTRATION FEES SALES TAXES PROPERTY TAXES AND NONE OF THAT REFLECTED IN THEIR REQUEST. WE COULD ENTERTAIN A COLA- BASED THE JUDGMENT TO REGISTRATION FEES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT'S BEEN A WHILE AND OTHER THAN MEMBERS ARE MENTIONED AS- POSSIBLY TURN AROUND. SACRAMENTO GREAT. YEP IT'LL ADD SO- ABSOLUTELY AND FROM TWO DOLLARS EVERY TWO YEARS TO SOMETHING AROUND TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS EVERY TWO YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT DEADLINE FOURTEEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I'M PETER PHILLIPS THE SAN DIEGO BORDER AND MEMBER OF THE R. BOC BOARD AND PROVIDING COMMENTS ON THE DB W. H. OF YOUR APP DEFICIENCY ISSUE I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AS YOU'VE HEARD THAT BOATERS PAY MORE THAN REGISTRATION FEES TO CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT BOATERS PAY A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN FUEL TAX DOLLARS TO THE STATE WE ALSO KNOW THAT BOATERS PAY SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAXES TO THE COUNTIES. IN WHICH WE RESIDE EIGHT LAW RECOGNIZES THESE PROPERTY TAXES HARBORS AND NAVIGATION CODE SECTION SIX SIX THREE POINT SEVEN PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR CALORIES COUNTIES THAT EXPAND A 100% THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY THE COUNTY FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES ON VESSELS FOR BOATING SAFETY PROGRAMS TO RECEIVE H. W. R. F. MONEY WE THEREFORE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO RECONSIDER THE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED AND 50% REGISTRATION INCREASE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANDATORY TAXES BOATERS CONTRIBUTE EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT DEADLINE. NINETEEN GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA LIQUOR AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HARBOR MASTERS IMPORT CAPTAINS WE ARE AN ASSOCIATION THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR SEVENTY THREE YEARS ALSO THE HARBOR MANAGER FOR PORT SAN LUIS HARBOR DISTRICT TO COMMERCIAL FISHING AND RECREATIONAL PORT ON THE SUBTITLE. PARTICIPATION SAID A CORRESPONDENCE TO YOU THIS MORE AND THIS MORNING I JUST WANTED TO HIT SOME HIGH POINTS IN REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT TO THE HARBOR CRAP HARBORING WATERCRAFT REVOLVING FUND YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE THAT A NUMBER OF BOATING MARINE AND FISHING STAKEHOLDER GROUPS HAVE VOICED AND WRITTEN CONCERNS- WRITTEN CONCERNING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN VESSEL REGISTRATION FEES WHILE OUR ASSOCIATION OF HARBORMASTER AND PORT CAPTAINS IS NOT SIGNED ON TO THAT GROUP OPPOSITION LETTER. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASE. AS YOU KNOW AND HAVE HEARD THIS MORNING WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM D. B. W. A FEW DAYS AGO IN. RESPONSE TO OUR GROUP CORRESPONDENCE THAT WAS SENT LAST MAY. AND THAT CORRESPONDENT CONCOURSE BOND AND TO RAISE THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND CONTAIN REQUEST FOR DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION. CENTER SEATING THAT DB W. RESPONSE AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT OUR ASSOCIATION HAS NOT HAD TIME TO FULLY DIGEST THE TOTALITY AND FROM INFORMATION PRESENTED. AND WE DO EXPECT A LETTER RECEIVED TO ALLOW US TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DOLLARS GO AND HOW THE PROGRAMS WORK. AND CERTAINLY IF THERE'S A NEED TO INCREASE THE IS A REAL REALLOCATE FUNDS. IN CLOSING- PLEASE KNOW THAT MANY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF GRANTS AND LOANS FROM CRITICAL INTEREST FOR CRITICAL. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND EQUIPMENT FROM DB W. AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS DERIVED FROM THE BOATING COMMUNITY ARE REASONABLY BENEFITING BOATING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY HAVE A GOOD REST OF YOUR MEETING. THANK YOU. NEXT DEADLINE. THIRTEEN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOMING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME'S CLEAVE HARDAKER I'M A SAILOR IN SAN DIEGO AND I OWN A THIRTY FOOT SAILBOAT THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE SALES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE I'VE BEEN ON THE RECREATIONAL BOARD A RECREATIONAL BOATERS BOARD. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. WE RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES MISUSE OF THE H. W. R. F. FOR SEVERAL PROGRAMS OF THE MANY YEARS AND PROPOSES TO CURTAIL THEM. HOWEVER WHILE THE PROPOSAL WITH KNOWLEDGE IS THAT EXPENDITURES FROM FUND OF GONE TO PROGRAMS ARE OF LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT TO BOATERS. THE REMEDY PROPOSED IS TO RECONSTITUTE THE FUND BY IMPOSING A TWO HUNDRED AND 50% SEE AN INCREASE ON VOTERS. THE VOTERS OF THE SAME MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THE MISALLOCATION OF FUNDS. THIS PROPOSAL AMOUNTS TO ADDING INSULT TO INJURY. THE FUNDS IN QUESTION. PUBLIC BEACH RESTORATION AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES. QUABBIN GEBO MUSSEL INFESTATION WHICH IS ALREADY A SURCHARGE ON BOTH REGISTRATION FEES. ARE ALL OF LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT TO VOTERS. SO THESE PARTICULAR LONG TERM PROBLEMS AROSE ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE OF THE LEDGER. SO THAT IS WHEN SOLUTIONS MUST COME FROM AND THOSE SOLUTIONS COULD BE PERMANENT. THE OVERALL SOLUTION SHOULD NOT BE A 210050% FEE INCREASE IMPOSED UPON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTERS IN THE STATE. THE DEPARTMENT MUST IDENTIFY AND SECURE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FROM OTHER BENEFICIARIES OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND MUST SEEK TO REDIRECT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF THE VOTERS FUEL TAX. TWO HARBORS A WATERCRAFT REVOLVING FUND. THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FOR DEVELOPING FOR SOLVING THE IMBALANCE. IN ADDITION CONCERN THAT WE HAVE A SEPARATE LETTER WHICH IS THE PROPOSED CORPORATE OFFICE. YEP OUT COMMUNITIES REQUEST FOR MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WOULD OCCUR AFTER THE INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND 50% REGISTRATION FEE INCREASE AND THIS IS PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT DEADLINE TWENTY FIVE. MY NAME IS REALLY SHORT I AM THE IMMEDIATE PAST CHAIRMAN OF THE BOATING AND WATERWAYS COMMISSION.

FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS SO THE SOLUTIONS PROPOSED TODAY. COULD HAVE BEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED INVENTED WITH BOATERS IN THE MARINE INDUSTRY PARTNERS THE PARTNERS HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED. THE VESSEL REGISTRATION INCREASE IS COMPLICATED AND HAS PROPOSAL IMPACT A LITTLE DOES THE MOST THE WEALTHIEST BOATERS WILL CONTRIBUTE LITERALLY NOTHING HI THIS ITEM NEEDS FURTHER CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE SET UP TO. THE SECOND GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THAT THE FUNDING OF THE LOAN PROGRAM WHICH WILL CREATE FURTHER FINANCIAL NEGATIVES FOR BOATING AND WATERWAYS. BECAUSE BOATING AND WATERWAYS USES THESE LOAN REPAID BACK OF THESE LOAN FUNDS FOR OPERATIONS AND SO THIS WILL CREATE A- IN IMMEDIATE.
