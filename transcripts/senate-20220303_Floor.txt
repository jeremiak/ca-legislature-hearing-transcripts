WHO HAD WORKED FOR THE SENATE FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES. SEVERAL SENATORS RAISE THEIR MICROPHONE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO RICHARD AS BOTH AN AMAZING EMPLOYEE BUT ALSO A WONDERFUL MAN WITH A GENEROUS HEART. AND A KIND LOVING SOUL. UNFORTUNATELY RICHARD WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THE CEREMONY IN PERSON AS HE WAS AT HOME IN THE FINAL STAGES OF BATTLING THE CANCER THAT HAD PLAGUED HIM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. I KNOW RICHARD WHAT'S THE CEREMONY ON HIS COMPUTER AND HE WAS EXTREMELY MOVED- BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT HIM BY ALL OF YOU. THAT VERY DAY THAT WE WERE HONORING HIM ON THE FLOOR THE DOCTORS CAME IN AND TOLD HIM THAT HE ONLY HAD TWO DAYS TO LIVE.

DESPITE ALL OF RICHARD'S CHALLENGES AND EVERYTHING THAT HE FACED. HE NEVER LET THE DISEASE DEFINE HIM OR HIS SPIRIT. RICHARD FOR ALL O THE STEPS SUFFERING THAT HE'D GONE THROUGH WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE UNPARALLELED THREE REMARKABLE RESILIENCY AN ABSOLUTE GRACE AND EVEN HUMOR. HE WAS BEING RELEASED TO GO BACK HOME WHEN HE WAS IN A REHABILITATION CENTER AND I OFTEN CALLED TO CHECK ON HIM AND PRAYED WITH HIM. AND I SAID HEY HOW'S IT GOING WHEN I CALLED HIM AND HE GOES IT'S GOING OKAY I SAID WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND HE GOES WELL MISS GROUP HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GET DRESSED WITHOUT LEGS. I SAID NO I HAVEN'T HE GOES WELL TODAY WAS MY FIRST TIME AND I DID IT IN A RECORD FORTY SEVEN MINUTES. AND EVEN AT THAT MOMENT HE CHUCKLED I'M CRYING ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. AND HE'S HE'S LIKE I DID IT AND HE'S GOT A CHUCKLE IN HIS VOICE. I KNOW THAT RICHARD FACE THIS CHALLENGE IN HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD A SOUL FULL OF HOPE THEY CARRIED HIM THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFICULT YEARS AND HIS STRENGTH INSPIRED MANY INCLUDING MYSELF. I KNOW THAT RICHARD IS IN HEAVEN WITH HIS LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST. AND I KNOW THAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT JESUS WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR. FROM YOUR EYES THERE WILL BE NO MORE DEATH OR SORROW. OR CRYING OR PAIN. AND THAT THESE THINGS WILL BE FOR EVER GONE.
