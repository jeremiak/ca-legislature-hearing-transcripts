FEW FOLKS ON IT WITH THAT BEING

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:17.141

THEM AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.814

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.341
A WAY TO DRAW A DISTINCTION

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.410
BETWEEN PROJECTS THAT WERE

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.679
HIGH RISK FOR DISTURBING

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.714
SOIL FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.149
KNOW POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:01.984
FROM PROJECTS THAT ARE MINOR

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.285
I DIDN'T EVEN IF THE SOIL

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:04.653
WERE CONTAMINATED WOULDN'T

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.389
BECAUSE -- YOU KNOW AND --

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:09.491
IN EXASPERATION OF A OF A

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.627
EXISTING SITUATION THERE WAS A

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.362
WAY TO PARSE THAT OUT IT WOULD

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.730
BE HELPFUL AND IN ADDITION

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.498
IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.566
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AN EXPERT

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.201
IN THE CORTESE LIST CERTAINLY

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:20.869
THAT ONCE A PROJECT IS ON THAT

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.137
LIST IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OFF

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.139
EVEN IF IT'S BEEN REMEDIATED

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:26.709
AND SO -- GIVEN THAT SEE WHAT

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.243
YOU KNOW IS USE QUITE A BIT

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.879
FOR ADDRESSING CONCERNS THAT

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:31.980
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.148
UNDERLYING CONCERN THAT THE

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.583
SEQUEL REVIEW IS LOOKING AT

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.818
YOU KNOW CONCERNS JUST ABOUT

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.821
DEVELOPMENT -- ALL KINDS OF

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.089
REASONS WHY PEOPLE SOMETIMES

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.156
WANT TO DELAY OR STOP THE

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:43.492
PROJECT I HAVE A WORRY THAT

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.461
THIS COULD BE USED -- EVEN FOR

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.562
SITES WHERE THERE REALLY IS

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.464
NOT GOING TO BE AN IMPACT --

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.798
THE SITES WHERE THE CHANGES

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.501
ARE MINOR SITES WHERE --

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.670
-- THE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.538
REMEDIATION THAT WAS ADEQUATE

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.707
-- AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.409
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO YOU HAVE

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.778
THE ABILITY TO ALSO TO STILL

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:04.480
ASK FOR REMEDIATION ASKED FOR

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.415
AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW I'M

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:09.885
JUST -- NOT SURE THAT -- --

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.487
THEY'RE SORT OF ENOUGH TIMES

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.689
WERE LOCALS DON'T ASK FOR THAT

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:14.990
AT TIMES WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.426
TO JUSTIFY WHAT COULD HAPPEN

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:18.594
TO THE PROJECTS THAT DON'T

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.728
REALLY NEED THIS LEVEL OF

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.196
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS YOU KNOW

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:22.731
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE REALLY

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:23.732
TRYING TO GET MORE HOUSING

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.101
BUILT -- AND WHERE PEOPLE

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.603
ARE FIGHTING NEW DEVELOPMENTS

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:28.804
YOU KNOW TO THE NOW ALL OVER

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.140
THE STATE SO I'M ALSO GONNA

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.574
-- LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.609
AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU CAN

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:34.977
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT MAYBE TO

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:38.046

BACK IN WEEKS WITH AMENDMENTS

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.118
BUT IN DAYS BECAUSE WE FEEL

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:51.153
LIKE WE'RE ABOUT THE SENTENCE

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.522

HARD AND REALLY PARSING THINGS

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:03.432
OUT WITH US -- THAT SAID --

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:06.535
I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY BEING

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:07.769
VERY VERY CLEAR AS TO WHAT

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.271
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.672
THERE ON THE STREET THAT IS

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.308
SO DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW THE

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.011
COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS NOT

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:18.247
ALTHOUGH IT MAY SOUND LIKE IT

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.281
AND AND AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.315
A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.084
THE LANGUAGE BUT IT ISN'T IT'S

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.519
A LITTLE BIT OF A A MISLEADING

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:25.888
TITLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.589
MEAN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.158
LIKE A TEMPORARY FENCE WHICH

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.860
MONEY TO SAY PARENTHETICALLY

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.462
IS ORDINARILY NOT A SEQUEL

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:34.630
PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.633
SO WE QUESTION SIGNIFICANTLY

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.501
HOW SOME FOLKS ARE WORRIED

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:40.636
ABOUT PUTTING A TEMPORARY

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.004
FENCE UP WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.038
NEED ACROSS THE COUNTER TO

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.007
GET A PERMIT LET ALONE A SEEK

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.942
REVIEW BUT THAT SAID WITH THE

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.744
COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION ACTUALLY

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:52.681
SAYS IS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.684
POSSIBILITY NO POSSIBILITY WITH

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:58.954
CERTAINTY BASED ON EVIDENCE

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.523
THAT THE PROJECT IN THIS CAN

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.092
ONLY BE APPLIED TO A PROJECT

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.193
THAT IS LISTED IN THE SEQUEL

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.829
GOT EYES AS A PROJECT YOU KNOW

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.231
NOT TO FIXING THE SHINGLES ON A

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:12.234
ROOF WHICH IS A REPAIR A SINGLE

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.570
PROJECT -- IF YOU CAN MEET ALL

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.873
THOSE STANDARDS THEN YOU CAN

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.943
SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:27.015
IS EXEMPT FROM ANY TRIGGERING

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:29.117
BY THE CORTES THE LIST OF SEEK

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.219
REVIEW NOW THE PROJECT THAT

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.255
COMES NEXT MAY STILL TRIGGER

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.791
SEQUEL REVIEW BECAUSE IT'S A

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.426
STRUCTURE A HOUSE HAS TRAFFIC

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.994
IMPACTED HAS WATER RUNOFF

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:42.230
IMPACT WHATEVER BUT FOLKS HAVE

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:45.300
BEEN USING THE WITH CERTAINTY

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.135
AND WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:50.839
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BASED ON

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:54.409
EVIDENCE -- REALLY IN VIOLATION

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:55.978
OF OF IN SOME CASES ALL THREE

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.847
OF THOSE TERMS WE WE REVIEWED

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.816
AS PART OF ALL THIS WORK THE

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:01.984
APPLICATION AND I DON'T KNOW

STONE AND A COUPLE OTHERS KNOW

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:07.189
THIS SITE BUT -- THE HUNTERS

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:09.191
POINT SITE IN THE BAY AREA

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.592
WHICH PUT IN AN APPLICATION

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.561
FOR EXEMPTION APPLICATION FOR

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.463
EXEMPTION IN PART BASED ON THE

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:18.400
CORTES THE LIST TO DO WORK ON

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.269
THAT SITE REMEDIATION WORK WHAT

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:22.604
WE CALL FACE TO REMEDIATION

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.506
WORK WHICH IS A SEQUEL PROJECT

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.575
BY DEFINITION THAT INCLUDES

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.311
TRENCHING TAKING OIL OFF THE

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.480
TOP OF THE BAY OFF THE TOP

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:34.583
OF THE BAY REALLY THIS IS A

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:37.119
KNOWN CONTAMINATED SITES OKAY

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.389
AND THEIR ARGUMENT WAS WITH

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.024
CERTAINTY WITHOUT GOING ANY

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.392
FURTHER WITH CERTAINTY THERE

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:47.662
IS NO POSSIBILITY OF OF --

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.798
SIGNIFICAN ENVIRONMENT IMPACT

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.533
TO GO FORWARD BASED ON THE

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.834
EVIDENCE AND THEY WROTE EIGHT

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.436
PAGES THEY GAVE THE EVIDENCE

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.771
THEY SAID HERE'S WHAT'S ALL

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.571
OUT THERE AND HERE'S WHAT WE

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:59.107
HAVE TO DO BUT THEY WANTED TO

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.510
BE ABLE TO DECLARE UNILATERALLY

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:02.577
THAT IT WAS OKAY TO PROCEED

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.446
FORWARD WITHOUT EVEN AN INITIAL

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.515
STUDY NO ONE WAS ASKING FOR

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.250
IT BERMAN WHAT IMPACT REPORT

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.819
NOT EVEN AN INITIAL STUDY

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.789
COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION SO

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.690
THAT'S ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:17.559
WAS LITIGATION PENDING IN THE

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.461
STATE AND SO FORTH SO WE KNOW

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:23.031
WE NEED TO -- DEAL WITH THIS

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.433
NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS ON THE

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:28.203
CLOSE SITE ISSUE -- THIS BILL

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:32.207
IS THIS BILL IS NOW DESIGNED TO

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:33.475
ALLOW PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.078
CERTIFICATED AS CLOSED BUT TO

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.846
PROCEED FORWARD UNDER ORDINARY

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.614
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS RIGHT

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.451
PROJECTS THAT WOULD ORDINARILY

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:43.752
BE EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL ANYWAY

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.220
CAN PROCEED IRRESPECTIVE OF

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.455
THE FACT THAT THE THEY'RE

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.256
STILL LISTED ON ON THE SITE

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.558
AS ONE OF THE FORTY THOUSAND

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:51.726
THAT'S A CLOSE SITE WHAT WE

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.128
NEED TO DO AND I WANT AGAIN

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:54.863
COMMIT TO THE CHAIR IS COME

ARE ENUMERATED IN THE BILL WE

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:07.642
WE THOUGHT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:08.743
IT'S CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WOULD

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.146
LIKE US TO YOU KNOW ENUMERATE

TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:44.305
WELLS AND -- THE CURRENT CAP

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:45.573
IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS IF I'M

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:46.974
NOT MISTAKEN IS THAT CORRECT

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.075
THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT HAVE

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.043
THEY USE THE THREE MILLION

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.478
DOLLARS YET TO DO ANY OF THIS

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.813
WORK SO THERE IS STATUTORY

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.048
LAW THAT THEY CANNOT GO OVER

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:55.216
THREE MILLION THEY'VE CERTAINLY

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:56.550
USED UNDER THREE MILLION BUT

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.119
THEY CANNOT GO ONE DOLLAR OVER

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.720
THREE MILLION SO THAT IS WHAT

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.155
WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE TO FIVE

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.389
MILLION RIGHT BUT THEY HAVEN'T

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.591
EVEN GOT TO THE THREE MILLION

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.893
YET THEY'VE STILL AT THEY THEY

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.962
TH ANNUAL PRO THEY DO GET TO

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:09.396
A CERTAIN AMOUNT EACH YEAR IT

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:10.898
HAS TO BE UNDER AND THE WAY

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:11.999
THAT IT WORKS IT'S BASED ON

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:13.400
THE PROJECT SO THEY'RE LOOKING

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:14.401
AT PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:16.270
THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.038
TO DO THEM SAID IF APPROVED

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.273
THE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LIST

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.441
OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS SO THE

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:22.276
IDEA IS TO GET TO AS MANY AND

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:23.344
CERTAINLY THERE'S PROJECTS THAT

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:24.411
RANGE BETWEEN SEVERAL HUNDRED

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:26.413
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU KNOW

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.915
THREE MILLION SO YES EVERY

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.416
YEAR THEY USE THE MONEY DO THEY

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:30.684
USE IT UP TO THREE MILLION NO

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:32.019
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT START A

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.687
SECOND PROJECT WITHOUT THAT SO

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:35.556
IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA BE A GIVEN

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:36.590
THAT THEY WILL NEVER ACTUALLY

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.225
GET TO THE EXACT AMOUNT GIVEN

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:40.661
THE STATUTORY OKAY AND THEN

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.930
THEY COLLECT THIS FROM THE

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.465
PRODUCERS INDUSTRY CORRECT

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:47.535
INDUSTRY SO THEY PAY AND AND

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:50.337
THEY RECOVER THAT BY RAISING

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.506
PRICES ON THE BARREL OF OIL

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.009
THE INDUSTRY HAS HAD OUR WE'RE

WITH THAT I THINK THAT THE

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:01.949
