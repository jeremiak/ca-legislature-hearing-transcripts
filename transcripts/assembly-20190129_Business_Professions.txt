SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- NOW TIME FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COULD YOU MEMBERS. DR. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU -- FOR EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER TRY TO GET TO CLEAN THIS UP -- SO MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THIS NOW WAS GOING TO DO IT AND WHAT WE WON'T BE BACK UNTIL WE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN -- THAT THIS IS GOING TO FIX THE ISSUE THAT WAS LAST BILL. THERE HAS BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- OF THE PHARMACIES PRESCRIBERS DISPENSERS AND THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ASSURES THAT -- WHATEVER IS PUT TOGETHER IS GOING TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SO WE THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. WILL SSURE MOVING FORWARD THAT WE WILL HAVE COMPLAINT FORMS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO BE UTILIZED BOTH BY DISPENSERS AND PRESCRIBERS. OKAY AND JUST TO THE AUTHOR -- I THINK YOU FOR THE YOUR WORK ON THIS AND I'M SURE YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT. TO TREAT THE OPIOID CRISIS WE NEED EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AVAILABLE TO US ABSOLUTELY AND AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT -- PROBLEMS REASONING EXPONENTIALLY IN THE DURING THIS TIME SO IT'S IT'S IT'S MUCH NEED TO START CORRECT YEP AND TEN NOW ONLY BY RE INTRODUCE HOPE -- OVERDOSE PREVENTION I'M HOPING YOU'LL BE THERE WITH ME. ABSOLUTELY THANKS. THANK ARAMBULA. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW OUR LAST GOVERNOR HAD A FUNNY WAY OF SAYING THAT HE SAID IF YOU'VE BEEN IN OFFICE LONG ENOUGH YOU ACTUALLY AROUND SOMETIMES TO HELP FIX SOME OF YOUR MISTAKES. OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS THEIR DISCUSSED. THIS IS A VERY WELL MEANING PRIOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS AN EASY FIX THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY -- I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF IT ACTUALLY TO HELP MAKE SURE WE REACH THE URGENCY THAT THIS BILL NEEDS. THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE TODAY NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE ON OPIOID TO ARE UNABLE TO FILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS. AS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE ON THE STATE'S WHO'S WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS BEFORE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE FIGURE OUT HOW WE START TRACKING AND SERIALIZABLE WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WERE IN THE PRIOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE MY STAFFERS SISTER WHOSE UNABLE TO FILL THE PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SERIAL NUMBER THAT'S ON IT. THIS DELAY OF TWO YEARS WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENTATION CORRECT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. AS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. AS IT GOES FORWARD TO HELP CONVINCE ALL OF US ON THE DÃ­AS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MATTER SO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR INTO THE CHAIR. FOR CREATING THIS MUCH NEEDED FIX AND FOR ALLOWING US PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR PATIENTS AND CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CONSUMERS AT THIS TIME SEEING NONE. SORRY COOPER DO WISH TO CLOSE. WE HAVE THREE RIVAL GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OF FROM LAST YEAR THIS A BILL PREVIOUSLY WAS TO PROVIDE A SERIAL NUMBER SOME PRESCRIPTION PADS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ABLE TO TRACK -- THESE LOST OR STOLEN PRESCRIPTION MARKET AND THE RATE -- CAUSING THE PROBLEM -- WITH THE ABUSE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS AND SO WITH THIS AND ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HELP FURTHER TRACK THAT AND GIVEN A SUMMER COOPER IS BACK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT'S OF APPROVING THAT YET YOU'VE CARRIED THIS AND PRESENT IN THIS BEFORE SO.
