01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.059
CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT ENFORCE

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.827

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:07.456
PERPETRATORS EVADE JUSTICE.

SO THAT THEY CAN NOT THOSE THAT

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.565
RASTER ATTACK THEM CAN DECIDE

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:18.600
WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM.

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:23.038
I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I'VE.

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:28.276
MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:29.878
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER --

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:31.546
AYE THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS WITH

01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:34.716
THIS BILL I THINK WE ALL AGREE.

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:36.218
THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.252
WITH RESPECT TO SEXUAL

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.587
HARASSMENT WHETHER IT'S IN THIS

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:39.955
BUILDING OR WHETHER IT'S IN THE

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.490
PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.125
BUT THERE'S ONE THING TO

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:47.863
CONSIDER WITH THIS BILL INDICTS --

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.699
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WANT

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:50.999
[inaudible]

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.435
THAT CONFIDENTIALITY.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.670
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT WHAT

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.538
HAS HAPPENED TO THEM TO BE

01:17:56.605 --> 01:17:58.940
PUBLIC AND THEY WANT TO SETTLE.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:02.044
WITH THEIR EMPLOYER --

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.612
YOU KNOW WHAT WITHOUT HAVING IT

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.680
PERHAPS MADE PUBLIC ARE SPLASHED

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:06.715
ACROSS THE PAPERS AND I THINK

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:07.849
THAT'S SOMETHING WE TO BE VERY

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:08.984
CAREFUL.

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:19.561
ABOUT TAKING AWAY FROM THEM I'M

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:20.295
I AGREE THAT IT IS --

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:26.001
NOT APPROPRIATE WHEN SOMEONE IS

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:26.635
BULLIED INTO IT HOWEVER THERE

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:27.269
ARE TIMES WHEN THAT IS EXACTLY

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:27.769
WHAT AN EMPLOYEE WANTS.

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:28.370
THE SECOND POINT THAT I WILL

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.071
BRING UP WITH THIS BILL IS THAT

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:29.237
IT.

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:30.739
DOES NOT AND APPLY TO GOVERNMENT

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.241
AGENCIES.

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.810
SO I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.846
APPLY THESE TYPES OF ROLES.

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.148
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT NOT TO

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.316
OURSELVES AND TO GOVERNMENT

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.318
AGENCIES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:43.985
ARE.

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.387
TRYING TO WHAT KIND OF ATTACK

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.622
THIS PROBLEM AT ALL FRIENDS WE

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:48.790
CAN'T DO EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:49.091
[inaudible]

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:52.928
BUT IT'S HYPOCRITICAL FOR US TO

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.529
PASS A BILL LIKE THIS AND SAY

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.898
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU BUT NOT FOR US

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:57.833
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I COULD

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.267
HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED VERY EASILY

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:01.236
IN THIS BILL BUT I WASN'T SO.

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.038
FOR THOSE REASONS --

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:09.277
I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.779
THANK YOU MS MELENDEZ SEEING NO

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:14.382
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.517
MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAKE

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.419
LOVE THINK ILL AND THIS BILL IS

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.554
RECENTLY AMENDED WOULD ALLOW THE

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:20.956
VICTIM TO REQUEST TO KEEP

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:21.957
CONFIDENTIAL ANY PERSONAL

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.425
INFORMATION THAT COULD REVEAL

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:24.559
THE VICTIMS IDENTITIES.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:25.994
SO I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.829
AMENDMENTS TAKEN --

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:29.698
FIRST OF ALL DO YOU DO ADDRESS

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:30.365

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.834
PROBLEM THE SECOND PROVISION HAS

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.870
BEEN AMENDED TO ENSURE.

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.037
THAT EVEN THAT'S MORE LIMITED

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.639
CONFIDENTIALLY PROVISION WOULD

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.274
NOT APPLY WHERE ONE PARTY TO THE

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.775
AGREEMENT IS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:41.910

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:43.145
THIS AMENDMENT RESPONSE TO

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.146
CONCERNS FROM THE NEWSPAPER

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:45.885
BUILDINGS.

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:49.856
WHO MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES?

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.124
WHO DID SOME VERY NEGATIVE

01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:52.492
THINGS LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.160
JAPANESE INTERMENT AND WHO

01:53:54.227 --> 01:53:55.828
PLAYED A VERY BIG ROLE IN THAT?

01:53:55.895 --> 01:53:57.297
THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE STATE

01:53:57.363 --> 01:53:59.232
OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:00.633
MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ON THE

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.734
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:04.604
CELEBRATE.

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.272
BUT WHO WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.041
PUTTING THE JAPANESE AMERICANS

01:54:08.107 --> 01:54:10.076
IN INTERNMENT CAMPS.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:13.379
SHOULD WE REMOVE HIS NAME.

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:15.248
HEY ASHBURY AND SAN FRANCISCO IS

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:18.251
NAMED AFTER GOVERNOR HATE.

01:54:18.318 --> 01:54:21.087
LOT OF LOT OF RACIST.

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:22.755
COMMENTS COMING OUT OF HIM IF

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:24.023
YOU LOOK BACK ON THE HISTORY OF

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:24.624
THAT SHOULD WE CHANGE THE NAME

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:27.627
OF PAID ASH VERY.

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:28.528
I MEAN HOW FAR DO YOU WANT TO

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.630
TAKE THIS.

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:31.598
IT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY THINK

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.932
ABOUT DO YOU WANT TO CENSOR

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:35.468
HISTORY BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.636
BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT YOU

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:40.173
WANT TO DISAGREE WITH THAT --

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:40.773
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:42.408
THAT.

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:43.443
ART ARE DANGEROUS TO FIRST

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:44.777
AMENDMENT [inaudible]

01:54:44.844 --> 01:54:48.748
I THINK --

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:50.650
AND SO LOOK I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:51.818
LOOK AT FIGURES IN HISTORY

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:54.287
[inaudible] FOR THE FOR THE

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:55.188
COMPLICATED FIGURES THAT THEY

01:54:55.255 --> 01:54:56.956
ARE.

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:58.358
RIGHT AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:00.226
AND TALK ABOUT.

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:01.427
YOU CAN'T PUT PEOPLE INTO A

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:03.329
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:04.998
VIEWPOINT WHEN THEY LIVED IN A

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:07.200
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIME THEN

01:55:07.267 --> 01:55:09.602
YOU AT ALL YOU AND I'LL DO IT.

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:11.304
RIGHT AND I THINK TROOP TO

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.439
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUE TRULY --

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:14.707
INTERESTED IN HISTORY AN INSTANT

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:16.409
TALKING ABOUT HISTORY AND

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.011
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE GET BETTER.

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.145
AND HOW WE IMPROVE UPON OUR

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:20.446
DEMOCRACY.

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:22.448
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:23.950
SO I WOULD URGES BODY TO BE VERY

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:25.385
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS I WOULD

01:55:25.451 --> 01:55:26.986
REJECT THIS THIS POLICY OF

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.322
CENSORSHIP.

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.957
AND LET'S HAVE THE RICH DIALOGUE

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:32.392

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:39.165
HAVE ABOUT OUR HISTORY THANK YOU.

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.900

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:45.305
I'M SORRY.

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:47.607
SHE'S THE AUTHOR.

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:48.574
I'M LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL

01:55:48.641 --> 01:55:50.343
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THANK YOU

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.545

RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.084
RESOLUTION.

01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:00.653
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT.

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.588
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT HISTORY NOT

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:03.723
JUST U. S. ISSUE BUT HISTORY IN

01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:05.758
GENERAL?

01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:07.060
YOU GENERALLY DON'T CELEBRATE

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.061
THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:10.596
TRAITORS.

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:12.432
AND IT'S NO POINT US PRETENDING

01:56:12.498 --> 01:56:15.068
THAT THE CIVIL WAR WAS SOME

01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:17.036
LITTLE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED.

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:18.805
IT WAS A DIRECT ATTACK UPON THIS

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.973
NATION AND WHAT THE NATION STOOD

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.342
FOR WEATHER WAS PRO AGAINST

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:23.910
SLAVERY THIS WAS A DIVISION IN

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:24.944
THE NATION.

01:56:25.011 --> 01:56:25.778
AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:28.748
GOVERNMENT SO LESS NOT PRETENDED

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:29.315
TO SOME WILL PARTY THAT TOOK

01:56:29.382 --> 01:56:31.217
PLACE BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:32.785
PEOPLE WITH A FEW IDEAS AND A

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.354
COUPLE OTHER THINGS THIS WAS A

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.456
MAJOR EVENT IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:38.257
THAT CHALLENGE THE DEMOCRACY WE

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:40.059
DON'T HAVE STATUES THAT I KNOW

01:56:40.126 --> 01:56:42.028
OF TO BENEDICT ARNOLD.

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:43.429
AND PROBABLY IF WE PUT ONE UP

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.997
FOLKS WOULD BE UPSET.

01:56:45.064 --> 01:56:46.499
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.434
I'M LOOKING OVER LOOKING ALL OF

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:49.836
THE RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND

01:56:49.902 --> 01:56:51.838
ALL OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.606
RACES ACTIVITIES AS WE TALK

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:55.174
ABOUT THE SIXTIES ALL WE TALK

01:56:55.241 --> 01:56:55.541
ABOUT.

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:56.976
THE CIVIL WAR ITSELF WHAT WE

01:56:57.043 --> 01:56:58.745
TALK ABOUT THE SLAVE TRADE.

01:56:58.811 --> 01:56:59.612
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.114
ALWAYS SOME ISSUES AND SOME

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.648
CONFLICTS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:04.484
HAVE PHILOSOPHIES AND IDEAS THAT

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:06.085
WOULD DIFFERENT THAN OURS.

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:07.487
BUT THIS IS A MAJOR EVENT IN

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:09.188
THIS COUNTRY.

01:57:09.255 --> 01:57:10.590
AND WE SHOULD NOT THINK OF IT

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.058
ANY DIFFERENT THAN NORTH AND

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:13.760
SOUTH KOREA.

01:57:13.826 --> 01:57:15.294
WHILE THE OTHER VIETNAM IN THE

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:17.530
DIVISION THAT WAS THEIR THIS WAS

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:19.232
THEY'D ATTACK UPON THE DEMOCRACY

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:21.701
IN WHICH IT EXISTED AT THAT TIME.

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.503
AND IT CREATED A WAR THAT WAS A

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:26.205
WAR BETWEEN THE STATES AND IT IS

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:27.640
NOT JUST A MINOR INCIDENT.

01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:28.908
NOT SHOULD WE TEACH ABOUT THIS

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.676
MOST DEFINITELY.

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:32.145
WE SHOULD TEACH ABOUT IT IN OUR

01:57:32.211 --> 01:57:33.646
MUSEUMS IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS AND

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:34.747
WE SHOULD NEVER TAKE THIS OUT OF

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:36.115
OUR HISTORY BOOKS.

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:37.083
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO WASH

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:38.684
HISTORY AWAY SO THE PEOPLE NEVER

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.186
LEARN FROM THE PAST.

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:42.388
BUT WHEN I SEE A MONUMENT WHEN I

01:57:42.455 --> 01:57:44.924
GET ON A HIGHWAY OR FREEWAY I

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:46.426
BELIEVE AT SOME POINT THAT I AM

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:47.860
CELEBRATING THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.695
WHOSE NAME IS ON AND THAT'S WHY

01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:51.197
WE NAME THINGS AFTER PEOPLE.

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.365
AND SOMETIMES WE FIGHT ABOUT THE

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:53.633
NAMES IN SOME COMMUNITIES IS

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.168
WHOSE NAME SHOULD BE THERE THAT

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:56.602
SHOULD NOT BE THERE NOT BECAUSE

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:58.237
IT'S AN INSIGNIFICANT EVENT BUT

01:57:58.304 --> 01:57:59.672
BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:01.007
ELEMENT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.608
TEACH OUR CHILDREN EVEN WITHOUT

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:03.509
A STILL LESSEN.

01:58:03.576 --> 01:58:05.344
WOULD THEY SHOULD BECOME WHAT

01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:07.713
THEY SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE AND

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:08.281
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GREAT

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:09.248
AMERICAN.

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.750
AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:12.618
LET'S NOT WASH IT DOWN THAT IS

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:14.687
JUST AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:16.923
QUESTION OF THE CONFEDERACY AND

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.624
THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE CIVIL

01:58:18.691 --> 01:58:19.859
WAR IN THIS COUNTRY WAS A MAJOR

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:21.327
EVENT.

01:58:21.394 --> 01:58:22.595
THAT NOT ONLY DETERMINE WHAT

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:23.729
WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO WERE

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.598
ENSLAVED BUT DETERMINE WHAT

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:28.201
WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS DEMOCRACY.

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:28.801
AND WE SHOULD FIGHT FOR THAT

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:30.536
EVERY DAY AND THOSE WHO ARE

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:31.737
OPPOSED TO IT WE SHOULD

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:33.005
BASICALLY DEAL WITH THEM

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:34.373
AGGRESSIVELY AND NOT.

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.242
SOMETIME OTHER MAKE IT SOUND SO

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:37.944
ROMANTIC OF WHAT HAPPENED AT

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.912
THAT PARTICULAR TIME I STRONGLY

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.681
SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION I

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:43.282
SUPPOSE I STRONGLY SUPPORT US

01:58:43.349 --> 01:58:45.251
HAVING CONVERSATIONS ALWAYS

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:46.219
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

01:58:46.285 --> 01:58:47.487
THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS NAME

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:49.121
SHOULD BE THERE IN TERMS OF

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:50.756
TOTAL CONTRIBUTION BUT THEIR

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.758
EFFORTS TO DESTROY THIS NATION

01:58:52.825 --> 01:58:54.393
SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AND

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:55.895
SHOULD NEVER BE WASHED AWAY.

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:57.396
I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE

01:58:57.463 --> 01:59:00.066
FOR THIS RESOLUTION.

01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:00.900
THE DECK WEBER MISTER MATHIS YOU

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:02.935
ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:07.406
THEY WITH FEAR MEMBERS.

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:08.841
IN OTHER THERE'S A LOT OF SCENES

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:09.542
OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:11.310
QUOTES OUT THERE ABOUT

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:14.380
REMEMBERING IN OUR HISTORY.

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:15.548
AND IN THE MILITARY WE SAY LET'S

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:17.783
NEVER FORGET.

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:18.885
LET'S NEVER FORGET THOSE WILL

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.620
PASSED Y. THEY PASSED IN WHAT IT

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:23.122
WAS ABOUT.

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:24.857
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:28.528
WE TALK ABOUT LET'S NEVER FORGET?

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:30.096
BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT REMOVING

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:34.267
ALL OF THEIR HISTORY AND THROWN

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.068
INTO A MUSEUM [inaudible]

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:37.637
IS IMPORTANT.

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:40.139
THAT WE REMEMBER.

01:59:40.206 --> 01:59:41.674
THE IS A GENERATION THAT FORGETS

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:43.409
IT'S PAST.

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:45.578
GETS ITS HISTORY.

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:49.615
IS DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:52.018
AND THAT'S A FACT OF HISTORY.

01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:54.287
SO LET'S NOT TRY TO SHUFFLE AWAY

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:55.755
THE THINGS WE WANNA KICK UNDER

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:56.956
THE CARPET UNDER THE RUG AND

01:59:57.023 --> 02:00:00.092
DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT SO WE CAN

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:02.295
FORGET ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE.

02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:04.430
IT'S REMEMBER IT.

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:05.665
LET'S HAVE IT THERE THAT WE CAN

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:08.467
HAVE IT IN CONTEXT.

02:00:08.534 --> 02:00:09.302
AND LET'S REMEMBER AND LEARN

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:30.703
JUST ASK IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.071

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:50.689
MEMBERS HERE.

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:54.026
I JUST HAVE A SUGGESTION.

02:03:54.093 --> 02:03:56.395
KEN BURNS HAS CREATED A

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.631
REMARKABLE FILM.

02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:01.534
ON THE CIVIL WAR FOR PBS.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.171
IT IS THOROUGH AND COMPLETE AND

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:07.039
VERY VERY FAIR.

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:08.541
AND IT DOES PRESENT THE

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:10.643
COMPLEXITIES.

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:13.612
OF ALL OF THIS ARE AND ALSO OF

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:15.781
THE AFTERMATH IN A LIKE.

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.149
SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:18.784
VOTE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THIS

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:20.186
IS A DISCUSSION THAT.

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:21.787
PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO AND THAT

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:22.688
IT IS GOING TO BE A POLITICAL

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:24.590
MATTER.

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:25.724
BUT JUST AS A POINT OF

02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:27.393
INFORMATION AND IT IS A POINT OF

02:04:27.459 --> 02:04:31.363
A FIRST CLASS BIT OF HISTORY --

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.799
GET A COPY OWN IT I VIEW IT MORE

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:35.801

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:39.205
I'LL BE COMPLEXITY THAT'S AT

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.907
STAKE IT MAY STRENGTHEN YOUR

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:44.109
RESOLVE IN THIS ONE WAY OR THE

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.678
OTHER IT MAY.

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:48.981

REALLY REALLY GOOD [inaudible]

02:04:53.118 --> 02:04:56.021
IN A UNBIASED.

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:57.990
THOROUGH AND COMPLETE HISTORY.

02:04:58.057 --> 02:04:59.525
THAT IS A REMARKABLE PIECE OF

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:02.795
WORK THAT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:03.095
[inaudible]

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.431
WHAT TRANSPIRED --

02:05:05.497 --> 02:05:09.201
I THINK THE REMARKABLE THING IN

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:11.303
ALL OF BUT KEN BURNS DID WAS TO

02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:13.172
ABLE TO MAKE THIS IS COMPLEXES.

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:14.473
THAT IT AND AND AND AND

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.209
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THERE IS A OF

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:19.979
WELL KNOWN A HISTORIAN AND IT --

02:05:20.045 --> 02:05:20.913
WHO SAYS BASICALLY THAT THE

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:23.015
CIVIL WAR TURNED THE UNITED

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:23.382

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:26.151
FROM OUR TO INDIA'S.

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.319
THE PRIDE OF THE CIVIL WAR WAS

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:28.754
PERFECTLY [inaudible]

02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:33.626
A GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT. TO CALL

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE.

02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:37.663
PLURAL TODAY WE SAY THE UNITED

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:39.565
STATES OF AMERICA.

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:41.867
IS AND ALL THROUGH THE PAINT OFF

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:42.501
TO THE BLOODSHED IN ALL THROUGH

02:05:42.568 --> 02:05:45.537
THE CIVIL WAR THERE HAS BEEN AN

02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:48.007
ARC IN THEIR OF HISTORY.

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.575
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:52.711
CELEBRATING AN UNDERSTANDING.

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:54.780

CASE IN THE FILM.

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.155
THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:04.857
AMERICAN THE TWENTIETH AND

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:05.891
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY UNLESS YOU

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.228
AMERICA IN THE MIDDLE A OF THE

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:11.096
EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.364

WAY OR ANOTHER HERE.

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.701
WHAT I AM SUGGESTING IS THERE

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:16.869
ARE THERE IS A GREAT PIECE OF

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:19.004

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:23.409
A LOT OF THE COMPLEXITIES HERE

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:25.911
BOTH ON THE NORTHERN AND THE AND

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:27.546
THE SOUTHERN SIDE.

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:29.315
OUR ON I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

02:06:29.381 --> 02:06:30.516
VERY HELPFUL.

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:33.185
INSTEAD OF I THINK OF MAKING

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:34.720
PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT YOUR POINT

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:35.955
OF VIEW OVER.

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:37.389
OVER HISTORICAL SITUATIONS AND

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:41.460

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.436
REFERENCE AND I THINK THAT IT

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:52.237
WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL.

02:06:52.304 --> 02:06:54.239
AND QUITE INSPIRATIONAL FRANKLY

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:55.774

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:22.735
PEOPLE ARE STILL RAISING THEIR

WHO ARE MEMORIALIZED IN STATE --

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:33.645
I'M NOT STANDING UP TO SPEAK IN

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:36.281

FOLKS IN FACT I'M I'M SUPPORTING

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:41.086
THIS RESOLUTION AND I THINK.

02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:42.988
THE COMMENT FROM MY FRIEND FROM

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:44.790
SOUTH SAN RAFAEL ILLUSTRATES

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:46.625
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE.

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:49.461
MORE OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT --

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.296
OUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND

02:07:51.363 --> 02:07:53.132
I THINK IT'S I MEAN THAT'S

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.433
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE HAVE AN

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.001
UNDERSTANDING IN THAT EVERYONE

02:07:56.068 --> 02:07:58.370
IN HERE GETS THAT WE ARE UNITED

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:00.139
IN --

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:01.540
WANTING TO WORK FOR A BETTER

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:03.275
SOCIETY IN TREATING ONE ANOTHER

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:04.410
BETTER SO IT'S GOING TO

02:08:04.476 --> 02:08:05.711
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE MY PLEDGE

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:06.645
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:08.180
WE FOR THAT CONVERSATION BUT

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:11.984
WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION.

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:13.819
I DON'T THINK IT'S SEEKS TO

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:15.821
ERASE HISTORY ON I THINK IF

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:17.689
SOMEONE WERE SAYING GET RID OF

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:19.091
EVERY STATUE EVERY MONUMENT

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:20.659
EVERY NAME EVERY PLAQUE.

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:23.162
AND PUT IT IN THE DUMPSTER THAT

02:08:23.228 --> 02:08:24.630
CERTAINLY IS AN EFFORT TO ERASE

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:26.598
HISTORY I THINK PUTTING IN ANY

02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:28.834
MUSEUM MAKES SENSE --

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.803
YOU CAN.

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:32.805
PUT IT IN A CONTEXT WHERE THERE

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.940
SOME EXPLANATION INTO BACKGROUND

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.443
BEHIND WHO THESE FIGURES REALLY

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:39.378
WERE WHAT THEY DID WHAT THEY

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:40.479
STOOD FOR THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:43.315
IN HISTORY FOR THAT --

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:45.551
THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN IT'S

02:08:45.617 --> 02:08:47.886
A STATUE THAT JUST HAS A PLAQUE

02:08:47.953 --> 02:08:50.789
ON IT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN.

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:52.124
EVERYTHING IN THAT PERSON'S

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:53.792

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:01.133
DEEPER CONVERSATION RELEASED

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.968
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THEY

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:04.603

COMPLICATED AND THAT WAS A

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:14.947
DIFFERENT TIME IN OUR HISTORY

02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:16.415
THAT DOESN'T MAKE WHAT HAPPENED

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:17.983

YOU SEE THESE DEPICTION OF HOW

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:38.724
THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO

LIVE IN THESE THINGS THEY CALLED

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:41.693
THE DOG HOUSES WHICH WERE MUCH

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.928
BIGGER IN THESE.

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:45.230
TWO DESPERATE TOGETHER AND SIX

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:47.099
MEN WERE LIVING THERE.

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.200
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE IN

02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:49.401
THE WINTERTIME AND THEY ALL GOT

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:52.738
SICK AND MANY OF THEM DIED THERE.

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:55.007
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT.

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:57.776
THE DOT OF THE CONFEDERACY FROM

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:59.378

THEIR BATTALIONS WERE SET.

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:10.155
AND THE YOUNG MAN DIED THERE.

02:12:10.222 --> 02:12:12.357
THAT'S IN VIRGINIA.

02:12:12.424 --> 02:12:14.226

I'M NOT SUPPORTED SLAVERY

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.961
SLAVERY WOULD IN MY OPINION WAS

02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:51.930
A SENATE THE BIRTH OF PRICE.

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.298

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:14.953
BUT THE CIVIL WAR ALLOWED US TO

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.455
UNDERSTAND THE FIND THE ISSUE OF

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:19.257
STATE'S RIGHTS.

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:39.711
BE A UNION.

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:42.147
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:43.081

WHO DIED IN THIS WAR SHOULD BE

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.495
REMOVED BECAUSE WE IN CALIFORNIA

OR THAT GENERAL LEE'S HOUSE

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:02.334

WITHOUT OBJECTION.

02:15:03.128 --> 02:15:05.230
SO LET'S START WITH THE FACTS

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:07.065
THE HISTORIC RECORD IS CLEAR.

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.800
THE ROBERT E. LEE JEFFERSON

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.402
DAVIS AND P. G. T. BEAUREGARD

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.704
STATUTES WE'RE NOT ATTRACTED

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:14.506
JUST TO HONOR THESE MEN.

02:15:14.573 --> 02:15:15.574
BUT AS PART OF THE MOVEMENT

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:16.908
WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE CULT

02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:18.944
OF THE LOST CAUSE.

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:20.645
THIS COLT HAD ONE GOAL.

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:21.680
THROUGH MONUMENTS IN THROUGH

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:23.181
OTHER MEANS TO REWRITE HISTORY

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:25.083
TO HIDE THE TRUTH.

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:26.718
IS THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS ON

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:28.854
THE WRONG SIDE OF HUMANITY.

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.222
THE STATUTES ARE NOT JUST STONE

02:15:30.288 --> 02:15:31.690
AND METAL.

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:32.824
THEY ARE NOT JUST INNOCENT

02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:35.660
REMEMBRANCES OF A BENIGN HISTORY.

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:37.429
THESE MONUMENTS PURPOSEFULLY

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.331
CELEBRATE A FICTIONAL SANITIZE

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.999
CONSIDERED CITY.

02:15:41.066 --> 02:15:42.934
IGNORING THE DEATH IGNORING THE

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:45.170
ENSLAVEMENT AND THE TERROR THAT

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:47.038
IT ACTUALLY STOOD.

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:48.340
FOR AFTER THE CIVIL WAR THE

02:15:48.406 --> 02:15:49.875
STATUTES WERE PART OF IT THAT

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:52.077
TERRORISM AS MUCH AS BURNING A

02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:53.879
CROSS ON SOMEONE'S LAWN.

02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:55.647
THEY WERE ERECTED PURPOSELY TO

02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:57.415
SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO ALL WHO

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:58.717
WALKED IN THEIR SHADOW.

02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.818
ABOUT WHO IS STILL IN CHARGE OF

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:01.620
THE CITY.

02:16:01.686 --> 02:16:02.854
SHOULD YOU HAVE FURTHER DOUBT

02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:03.989
ABOUT THE TRUE GOALS OF THE

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:06.091
CONFEDERACY IN THE VERY WEEKS

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:08.026
BEFORE THE WAR BROKE OUT.

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:08.894
THE VICE PRESIDENT THE

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.996
CONFEDERACY ALEXANDER STEPHENS

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:11.997
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE

02:16:12.063 --> 02:16:13.598
CONFEDERATE CAUSE WAS ABOUT

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:15.200
MAINTAINING SLAVERY AND WHITE

02:16:15.267 --> 02:16:16.768
SUPREMACY.

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:17.969
HE SAID IN HIS NOW FAMOUS

02:16:18.036 --> 02:16:19.804
CORNERSTONE SPEECH THAT THE

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:21.673
CONFEDERACY CORNERSTONE RESTS

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.174
UPON THE GREAT TRUTH.

02:16:23.241 --> 02:16:24.509
THAT THE NEGRO IS NOT EQUAL TO

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.011
THE WHITE MAN.

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:28.446
THAT SLAVERY SUBORDINATION TO

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:30.348
THE SUPERIOR RACE IS HIS NATURAL

02:16:30.415 --> 02:16:32.384
AND NORMAL CONDITION.

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.319
THIS OUR NEW GOVERNMENT IS THE

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:35.787
FIRST IN THE HISTORY OF THE

02:16:35.854 --> 02:16:36.555
WORLD.

02:16:36.621 --> 02:16:38.490
BASED UPON THIS GREAT PHYSICAL

02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:41.192
PHILOSOPHICAL AND MORAL TRUTH.

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:42.227
IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:43.795
IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:45.564
CONTACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:47.232
CULT OF THE LOST CAUSE AND THE

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:49.534
REASON THAT FOLKS MADE AN EFFORT.

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:51.269
TO NAME OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:52.871
BRIDGES AND OUR ROADS AFTER

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:54.205

02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:58.810
THATCONTEXT.

02:16:58.877 --> 02:16:59.911
WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT HOW TO

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:00.912

RIGHT AFTER I GOT ELECTED WITH

02:17:51.796 --> 02:17:53.331

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:55.667
ACTUALLY ROBERT E. LEE

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.068
ELEMENTARY.

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:57.902
A SCHOOL THAT HAD BEEN

02:17:57.969 --> 02:18:00.105
ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE FIFTIES

02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:02.307
A SCHOOL THAT NOW HAS 97% PEOPLE

02:18:02.374 --> 02:18:04.376
OF COLOR.

02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:06.378

HERE ON THE FLOOR.

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:12.717
WAS SAID TO ME.

02:18:12.784 --> 02:18:13.885
BY FOLKS WHO DON'T EVEN LIVE IN

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:15.687
THE COMMUNITY [inaudible]

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:18.056
COMPLEX.

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:20.158
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY LET'S NOT

02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:21.192
GET RID OF OUR HISTORY BUT LET'S

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:23.328
TALK ABOUT THIS.

02:18:23.395 --> 02:18:24.429
MOST SCHOOLS IN A NUMBER OF

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:28.066
THESE THESE ARE TRIBUTES.

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:29.334
WE'RE PLEASED UP IN THE FIFTIES

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:31.436
AND SIXTIES AS A WAY TO THREATEN

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:32.203
AFRICAN AMERICAN [inaudible]

02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:34.172
FOLKS [inaudible]

02:18:34.239 --> 02:18:36.241
A REMINDER.

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:38.176
A REMINDER OF WHO WAS IN CHARGE

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:40.845
A REWRITING OF HISTORY.

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:43.014
SANITIZING OF THE CONFEDERACY

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:43.314
[inaudible]

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:45.784
THAT'S NOT.

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:47.619
GIVING OURSELVES SOME HISTORICAL

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:50.288
CONTEXT.

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:53.124
THAT'S TRYING TO REESTABLISH.

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.526
WHAT SOME PEOPLE STILL ARE

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:57.128
TRYING TO JUSTIFY?

02:18:57.195 --> 02:18:59.064
I ALMOST WALKED AWAY FROM THE

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.498
FIGHT OF RENAMING THE SCHOOL MY

02:19:00.565 --> 02:19:02.834
DISTRICT BECAUSE IT WAS TAKING

02:19:02.901 --> 02:19:05.704
UP SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY.

02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:08.640
IT WAS BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER.

02:19:08.707 --> 02:19:10.341
WHO IMPLORED ME EMPLOYED WITH

02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:10.642

02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:12.077
GOING.

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:14.312
MY DAUGHTER IS HALF BLACK.

02:19:14.379 --> 02:19:16.915
PER FAMILY COMES FROM ALABAMA.

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:19.350
AND SHE REMINDED ME THAT S..

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:22.020
DON'T EVER LET SOMEBODY SAY.

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:25.290
OUR HISTORY IS COMPLEX.

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:26.257
PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:28.593
CONFEDERACY.

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.428
THE PEOPLE WHO ENSLAVED MY

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:33.231
DAUGHTERS ANCESTORS WHO RAPED

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.266
THEM AND KILLED THEM.

02:19:35.333 --> 02:19:38.069
WHO SOLD THEM AND OWNS ABOUT?

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:40.305
IT'S NOT COMPLEX.

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:41.339
THERE WERE NO BUT NOT MINE

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:43.408
SLAVEOWNERS.

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:44.776
IF WE WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:46.878
OUR HISTORY.

02:19:46.945 --> 02:19:47.979
AND WATCHING KEN BURNS

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.848
DOCUMENTARIES WE HAVE TO BE

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.416
SERIOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.485
HAVE ALL UNFORTUNATELY.

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:55.220
BEEN PRODUCTS OF AN EDUCATION

02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:56.387
SYSTEM THAT TELLS US THIS

02:19:56.454 --> 02:19:58.089
HISTORY IS JUST.

02:19:58.156 --> 02:20:00.492
OKAY THERE WERE GOOD PEOPLE

02:20:00.558 --> 02:20:02.961

HE WAS COMPLEX NO HE WAS

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:07.766
FIGHTING TO HAVE A WHOLE.

02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:10.935
BUNCH OF FOLKS CONTINUE TO BE IN

02:20:11.002 --> 02:20:12.704
AN INSTITUTION.

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:14.239
WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO BE RAPED

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:15.406

02:20:15.473 --> 02:20:17.675
AND OWNED.

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.878
I'M SORRY I FIND NOTHING COMPLEX

02:20:19.944 --> 02:20:21.746
ABOUT SAYING THAT'S WRONG.

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:22.614
IN THAT WE SHOULD NEVER HONOR

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.983
FOLKS.

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:27.085
WHO ALLOW THAT TO GO FOR IT?

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.553
IN THAT OUR HISTORY SHOULD BE

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.922
HONEST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS.

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:31.523
THERE WERE NO BUT NINE

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:34.392
SLAVEHOLDERS THERE WERE NO BUT

02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:36.194
NINE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS.

03:01:25.708 --> 03:01:28.110
AN INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM MAKES

03:01:28.177 --> 03:01:31.547
EVEN MORE SENSE BUT THIS TYPE OF

03:01:31.614 --> 03:01:32.648
PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE BEING

03:01:32.715 --> 03:01:34.083
PUNISHED WITH JUST IT DOESN'T

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT SECOND HAVE

03:03:43.912 --> 03:03:44.847
THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN WE MAKE

03:03:44.913 --> 03:03:46.448
THESE CHANGES AND SO BY DOING AN

03:03:46.515 --> 03:03:47.816
INCREMENTAL STEP THAT'S THE

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:48.751
RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

03:03:48.817 --> 03:03:51.086
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE

GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY AND

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.263
THE TIME. TO FIND A DIFFERENT

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:03.132
SOLUTION.
