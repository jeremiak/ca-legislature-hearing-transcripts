Insuring that are taking care of orange county's better and is one of my top priorities and address scene V. I. homelessness in our population in Orange County has been a real area of focus as many you know right now are at three hundred and two. Most veterans living on the streets Orange County. One who has sacrificed so much for our country who has been so much for many of us. Find themselves without roof over their heads and that's why it's part of the twenty nineteen twenty twenty state budget I was proud to be able to secure two point nine million dollars in funding. In partnership with the Orange County United Way. And veteran homelessness here in Orange County today will be getting an update on. Program and a number of other initiatives underway here in Orange County. Our conversation we are going to dive into a couple of issues first the scope and scale of homelessness in Orange County second best practices and lessons learned in addressing this issue- and another communities and lastly the plan to end veteran homelessness in our county by twenty twenty. I said thank you all again for joining us today and thank you terror when ask for holding this hearing. With us today would you like to make an opening statement. Thank you Lara thank you very much assemblymember. Ours for biting need to participate- this the in trying hearing and good morning everybody. As chair of the- committee on veteran affairs I'm familiar with the state level. Birds are you a veteran homelessness and with major programs at the state operates aimed at ending. Veterans into shelter or housing. And in fact I have a bill that. Would ensure continued funding of the state's major veteran homeless prevention initiative which I hope to pass early next year. Although I know my own community well. And it's experience informs my understanding of the homeless I says I can't pretend to know what's going on in all fifty eight other counties- the opportunity doesn't come often to dedicate so much time interests to hearing in on the gala ground perspective. Of other communities and from people who are working directly. In these community to shelter veterans indeed and so I am very grateful to the chair for conceding- this the idea of this hearing. And her staff for putting it together and drawings of buried and compelling. Selection of speakers for the panels today. Thank you. I will go ahead and welcome our panelists hello one. I welcome Shannon là share hi Brian all of the air. Is a Lima Lindy. Ray said the rare. And Christopher. And car. Thank you so much for joining us. This morning I will go ahead and start I Shannon. I yeah. She lost her voice so that would work for today's hearing- but thank you so much of bring us so I'm here provide I'm an overview of the scope and scale of an Orange County- as assembly women Petrie-Norris men can and in the two thousand nineteen point in time how we found and hundred and eleven homeless veterans in our community and that includes sheltered and I'm sheltered I'm the twenty nineteen point in time count was really a key moment for Orange County in order to be able to understand current homelessness but we did with an actual account and implemented new methodology. That included the use of our gas technologies everyone to three so we can locate where veterans aren't I'm and return to those three pots and out reach to them we also incorporated half sheet in which we collect that thirteen person identifying data points for the better and that would help us understand and follow up with them future outreach efforts. That their name the veteran status branch of service character of this charge and any other additional like contact details that they were willing to share. We were really excited that. Of those. Two hundred and twelve out reach during the sheltered count- approximately half of them provided that information for us. That was often opportunity to reconcile our veteran registry. And the veteran registry list is the by name list of all the veterans in Orange County I and eight is populated by all the street outreach workers nonprofit fifties- that conduct our region our community and that encounter veterans and that way we are able to follow up with them and see their progress towards helping make sure that we connect those veteran to a case manager- healthy navigation services the- able to transition out of homes that. An active support. Resource. I'm going back live it to the point in time cap and as you mentioned it was three. In the lab and veterans. This represents roughly 3% of the homeless population in all of Orange County I'm which the nineteen point in time cannot. Found. Six thousand eight hundred sixty individuals experiencing homelessness in Orange County. I am and we have the opportunity to also do a deeper dive on that. The populations and demographics of the veterans- so we found that. Of the veterans bring think almost of the majority of them- near over a quarter of them our seniors their sixty two years of age and older after we have an aging population of that. Marking unity. At the majority of the homeless veterans are male approximately 90% of the veterans I'm county during when in time county. I'm in nearly half of them are experiencing chronic homelessness meaning that they have been. On the streets for a year longer and have a disabling condition. I'm that also makes them eligible for the high fashion. Which is showing that we have the adequate resources to help. Veteran homelessness- and then others the populations are characters is of our veterans and we noticed that. Nearly one in five veterans reported a mental health issue. And one third of our press reported a physical disability. And one quarter. Veterans reported having substance use issues. After having this detail information of the populations than other demographics allows an opportunity to tailor services to the veterans and stand and the connections that we need to make to with them to other support services. To ensure that they- are able to receive the care that they need. Over time I'm Orange County has had focus in addressing veteran homelessness and like other communities in the nation I have been successful in decreasing veteran home last I'm so proud of two thousand nineteen to do that then I mean sorry from two thousand fifteen to two thousand nineteen there was. A 34% decrease in veteran homelessness. And sent the point in time county now which is approximately. Like ten months I have we have seen a homelessness I'm just by really targeting are offered and- care for the veterans. The going forward we will continue- to manage the veteran registry the veteran registry the mention of the by name of all right to experiencing homelessness an Orange County- and these folks are. At the mention are entered by a street outreach teams and community organizations after the number of the veteran registry will fluctuate over time as we are reach to more friends and as veterans get house- but we have a downward trend which means that. Meeting our efforts I'm is definitely helping. I and this veteran registry is maintained weekly so we have weekly meetings to be able to contact the follow up and make sure that we don't. Have any veterans fall through the cracks. Or that were able to our reach to them properly. I'm out of the yesterday there were two hundred and sixty veteran health hold on the veteran registry. Thank you for the work that you're doing thanks for being here- are there any questions for the panelists or- need to our next. The forty five I'd like to introduce a member Sharon quirk Silva. By next year would you like to make a- comment before we move on. Good morning I want to thank us the chair of this committee or both chair should say of the Veterans Committee and accountability. Ability committee for hosting this here in Orange County- as- I look out there I see some familiar faces that have been working on veterans issues for quite a long time and on housing issues the two issues. Are coincide and have been part of the work that I've been doing I. Always is an exile yeah opportunity to learn more myself about these two issues but also went on I have Gaines information to share it's all just take one up point to privilege here I was had the opportunity yesterday to- go to the campus of cal poly. Which is out of my district but ana was invited for tour there and was able to go to the veteran center there resource center- which is ca. Well rounded place very active. And spoke to a few of the veterans firsthand and of the things again that I've heard cents my days as being chair of Veterans Committee. It is where are we not making the connection for veterans once they leave- we've talked about the taps program their program when they leave and it was a very stained remarks that I've heard really for the last almost six years that. When they are ready to leave and they're going to their orientation program that they just want to get home. SO some of the last things they're thinking about is all the paperwork and how to make the connections. It isn't sometimes until. A handful of months later. At the connections have been lost so even through that very short dialogue one of the things that we try to get back to is how can we- if you want to say. Figure out a way to get that connection so that when they are ready for it because you can't make them- just if you want to say go directly to a benefits officer if they're not ready for that but- of the same kind of advice was given the you know reconnecting so forth but one is to use some of the social media and- information and our phone. Which is perhaps get veterans that have been there already and then maybe it six months after they returned home more a year and all of a sudden now they're ready but they're not sure how to navigate and for them to actually do a little testimony so that that could be pushed out there too veterans so that they can actually see firsthand. That maybe within the first two months four months six months are not ready for that information. But a year later and so they can get first hand testimony which is. A live video something like that that's pushed out to them somehow- through an email or a text message so they can see that okay now I'm ready this is what I need to do. Because sometimes we talk about big programs that cost a lot of money. But this could be a very simple testimonies from somebody who's working with the navigation officer or with the county veteran officer so that they can say I was finally ready these are the steps I took but its first hand. So that's just from yesterday that Kalpoe E. but anyhow I look forward thank you. Thank you are will now hear from a couple of local veterans who are thanks for being here with that Hey you're saying your purse seven terms of transition particularly in terms of. Our housing challenges that you face. Our our with a broken often. A good morning members of the committee- good morning everyone thank you for having me here to get- my name's Brian all. Of those in the United States Marine Corps for about four and a half years I was eighteen twelve tanker. Twice once the Middle East these- Asia. And I got out in two thousand seventeen. When I got out I had thought that I planned everything out I had a job lined up. I had a seven thousand dollar savings- I just I had everything lined up and one of the reasons why. I think that I you know went through these challenges was because of circumstances that I couldn't quite control- they were out of my hands. One of the biggest reasons for me was is something that they don't tell you about the GI is that it's not considered stable income so what I mean by that say. You can't use it as proof of income you can't use that as- safer like pay stubs to qualify for an apartment for a car or anything- yet when and you try to apply for financial aid from school or try to apply for something like how fresh they say that you make too much money. So it kind of just cut at the knees. I got out with a one year old daughter I had a family- a lot of veterans to come out you know by themselves but then there's also veterans that you'll come out with the family. I have people that I a- and responsible for so- I was lucky enough to find an apartment a four hundred square foot studio. For fourteen fifty. An Orange County in Tustin. It was. A time of my life that I'd- made me a better person- made me stronger but it's a time period that don't like to go back to because it was very hard. Partly due to some of the restrictions of the GI bill so. One of the rules that they don't explain to you is how the GI works for instance I got out my E. A. S. for end of active service will temas sixteen two thousand seventeen. I got out two months ahead of time because I had a job I had you know a family out of an apartment I to get situated so I can have everything lined up perfectly and the rules stipulate with the GI bill is a you have to be out completely for an entire month. And yet you have to be. For an entire month. So I didn't actually get any type of income until December and I got out in August fourth- at seven thousand dollars. In Orange County does not last long especially when you're you know. You're monthly rent is fourteen fifty that shows. You you don't just come out. Three you still have. To store up responsibilities. And so ultimately I was living paycheck to paycheck. I had a job lined up as you know you don't just get paid right away. I you know. It was a very tough situation for me- and also had a kid out of one year old daughter it was just something that. Eight it got really scary for me I thought for one minute thousand be living in my car. You know my family you know something that. You know contemplating you think how did I get in the situation Iraq planned everything out so perfectly. How did that get in the situation your circumstances that I just couldn't control I just had to. Make do with what I had you know. Part of the biggest reason why I think I've made it so far as obviously because my daughter the love my dog but- the family that I found Irvine valley college- namely Nancy Montgomery who's been a- guarding angel from and she- has. You know a lot of resources for me. That allowed me to you know survive for the past- you know markets. But yeah I just- you know part of these parties problems are you know things that they don't quite explain and there's a lot of yellow tape around these things and- how. How are you supposed to you know make do with the cost of living you know this is. My client so. Part of what I think would help out is- finding a place where you know veterans coming out of the service have somewhere to go somewhere where they can be for like temporary housing somewhere they they can use for time short period where they can at least get on their knees you know not a okay back on their feet I should say. Yeah I think looking back that would have helped a lot- I think. About. The suicide the rates of suicide for veterans I don't want to sit here and say that the plate suicide but suicide was a definitely options but you know there's certain things you can't control you don't you know what are you supposed to do. And I've had a lot of friends a commit suicide at. Outside of the service you know and it's just. Can I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I had a good support system around me a friend you know. Being from- far away from my family Georgetown Kentucky coming to Orange County all by myself. It was it was pretty hard but I'm here and I hope that my testimony can help bring light to the situation. Thank you. Christopher Abbott as Christopher can we hear your perspective as well absolutely. Absolutely thank you for mere gratitude of my take your Brian thank you for sharing a compelling story as your personal experiences my take is really a little bit about my personal experience and the data. And at. So average household income this is a at a master's degree level to run AT que roughly I'm estimated and their their positions where like for example I have three kids I have a family of three we were in housing and there was a time when I was going to school full time and working was invested in my occupation which is a banking entry level bachelor's degree position and I was barely able to pay and for like at a one bedroom apartment. As a comparison. I just imagine of the you know from personal experience. How much the Martine that gap has has shifted income is very consistent however the markets for. Has changed dramatically right that there's a huge gap meaning I was very fortunate. I have to be very grateful because my wife's a veteran as well I was the United States Marine Corps she was as well so I did have a little bit more foundation I'm of I have a family when I transition out of service. However I felt the blow of the housing market the disparity between the income verses- you know the credibility factor is that and what it takes to survive in Orange County. So I do at the perspective like I said I have I have a ball for my wife was on the GI bill as well I know it's just extremely. Hard and might might take away is. The pain points I want to say you know. For contesting for veterans and a providing services a call to action would be to. Present some kind of resource where but veterans that our tradition transitioning are getting suitable. Housing situations situation maybe a partnership amongst different communities to housing these veterans going to this transition process because the fact is it is extremely hard out there to have a family for example and to pay your rants. On such a low standard of income when housing market just keeps increasing in income this relatively stays the same I apologize a little bit from my scattered- scattered speech are the. Burns was there and it was very hard for my family. And movie for I think there is you better solutions provide for veterans such as Brian transitioning out of service trying to ascend himself in society get to a much higher degree level and cutting through the noise of. Pain for housing taking care of a family going to school battling all the depression and all the personal experiences and all the battles that they have you know internally and also keeping like moving that ball that Neil for in their life so that's thank you for your time thank you for. Hearing me out and that's my speech. Thank you. That race the Carrera. Good morning to all for someone to say are take a second at the two thank you for your time for allow me to be in front of you guys a little trouble myself my name's residents- I served in the United States Navy I was eighty which is a- mechanic- I'm attending IBC right now looking for to transfer to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering- I'm I'm currently using my GI benefits and currently also do work city at school at school in about center- I was born and raised in Savannah. And that is actually were aye when move back right now to help my mom into their brothers to aye financially. Support them as much as I can right now on my way back home. After returning back from the service- today- I just want to bring up three of the biggest issues that have been calendar. Since you leaving and it's affordability. Accessibility and discrimination. Affordability there's no rent control in Orange County. And with that being said- as you've been hearing but these my to Bob. Veterans the little- are they they've experienced a an increase or rent. So there's really no control and the landlords have pretty much most of the power. And the deciding how much rent you know they could raise up. And I understand that if it's more than 10% they do have to do a sixty day notice but there's really no control over how much money they could raise it up- recently I experience of flooding in August nineteen. And with that you know I've been. Momentarily this place where we're kind of just look in the little room us all four together. And with that being said he the landlord already kinda hit to us that he will raise or by more than twenty percent- because of the renovations and he's doing- concert with me with that is that. That is a- a lot of like a maintenance in the area where I live in the apartment complex and I live in the- live close to send out a high school so it's nine two seven zero one. It's going to be one of the lower income on a as an Orange County. And of some of the concerns that I have is that on. He actually has an apartment upstairs that he reserves like Airbnb. I don't know that is legal I have done a couple of you research and I have yet to follow and like find the code that says that that is okay to do- that also brings me down to the says ability- second concern that I have been with that is that- I. Have been seen a an increase. And auto but short term rentals in the area. And I understand that a certain cities it are clear it is very clear fight in the states that it is legal. But in Santa Ana itself but I haven't done the will and research to. To find it- so with that we live next I live next to touching like the fences and a high school- with that with the Airbnb I don't know. Who is going in and out. It could be a pet a file a sexual you know harasser. There's really no control through those. Those apps- who's going in and out of. That apartment so that is my concern. With that and also others a lot of renovations but I don't see inspectors out there. I don't know their building without permit and I and I understand that since it's a lower income area a lot of people are free to speak up and actually bring up certain situations like that. And that is why. You know a lot- you know people in my area they get they speak up and they just as were in a month to month lease. That's very common also an Orange County- we just. We get elected. So I am afraid I am afraid that if I actually say something go to the city. You know. I'm gonna get evicted and where am I gonna go with my family my mom in the cooler weather. Another another point with the sensibility is the VA loan. I actually attempted to purchase a small condo under three hundred thousand because I know that's something that I could possibly afford. And the- the issue with that was that the VA loan dozen- they don't count your GI income. They don't count it as income. Seoul this is not stable so that that idea was off the- my list. The other thing that I attempted to do especially with the frustration with the flooding. Was you know research research for a low income housing. They say I make too much money because they count the GI bill as income. So for federal programs they count. GI bill as income but- for a VA loan I can buy a home because they don't count as income so I'm kind of stuck in the middle. I decided to what to do. The last thing that I want to talk about this discrimination. I've actually experience I know that a there's a certain image that some people have veterans or disabled veterans. And what that you know over up personal experience that I've experience was- my landlord- I asked if he could. Keep it down in the construction after a certain amount of time- due to- you know so you know certain mental you know. Issues that I experience and I cannot tolerate like really loud noise. Especially late at night. And he actually couple questions. And I quote. But I didn't think you. Want to combat. So being a woman being in the navy. You know people have their own pictures or even just as a veteran to have their pictures. Of what issues they actually have because I might seem normal you know we might seem okay you know physically right up front of you. But the you know. A lot of people don't know what goes on in our head when we're alone. And I just. In conclusion I just you know I just want you guys to my experiences with you know with housing as a veteran of the three issues that I encounter are portability USCIS ability in discrimination I might not be homeless now what of these issues remain me and- veterans responding up in the streets. Thank you for your time. Well thank you and to all three of you thank you for your service and thank you for being here. With us today to share your important perspective as we have this conversation. It's absolute heartbreaking I need to hear. Your story feeling like you've been discriminated against for your service when you come out of the military. We need to ensure that at. We don't. We don't just talk about honoring our veterans on veterans day at that we honor you in our actions and our deeds and as the work that we do as policy makers and- that is why we are here. Today. Any questions or comments and seven number. Thank you it to the three of you for sure answers I had one quick question Brian is the best to. Answer that. We are always cause concern transitions and how do we make sure that. When you leave the service that you receive all the information you need to know all the back. Your title to did you visit a CVS so or did you get your information on your- college. Or did did you participate in the cal cap program any of those resource- so in the last year that was in the marine corps I tended to summon are called to TRS seminar which all marines are supposed to take- it's- transition readiness. Me I don't remember the last the last name of it- but yes I attended it was a week long and what it is that you go through- possible job so you can get- that according to your- job in the marine corps- the other. Part it was your benefits package- what you qualify for what you can qualify for incoming now- and- you're supposed to get. Eight months before you get out of the marine corps and then your push back in two years the person you know go pick up drive will stand guard whatever. It is it's kind of just ridiculous it's kind of a check in the box if- I have learned more about- the things that qualify from veterans from word of mouth. That have from these TRS programs I've heard the same thing from you know other service members such as and not you know being in the army and the navy of all said the same thing I've- learned more. About some of these- programs through friends people who- you know who are far the VSO or something like that have told me about it so. Thank you. Again thank you for your testimony but- another way to say testimony is you stories and there they are child and real and- everything that you mentioned about how seen an Orange County is absolutely true and I think made harder. By as your story that you get- repeat to come back- from the appointment and now have to access everything from banking two two jobs all at the same time so my take away on this is going to be. To work with my partners up here too I don't believe that we do have transitional housing at all and even the short term. Could be a possible a pilot program here in Orange County. That you know like you said even if it's a three month and then another type of housing after that but I think that three months on ticket to. If you haven't already worked with the CVS so or if you still have questions but even to clarify what led you said about your benefits what you can use them for because it does look like it's a double edged sword where on the one hand it helps you. Two but on the other hand- they don't take it into account as far as a bank loan so those are certainly things that. You know some of it federal government but some of it at the state. We certainly can look into and that's exactly why these hearings are so important is for us to gain information but as I opened with where I'm Y. remarks is. Even us and I know we have it because it's being recorded but even a snapshot of your testimony I think could be very valuable- to the young military personnel that are exiting because your saying what's happened to you from experience. And some of those that type of testimony I think is very valuable because as I noted when you're exiting you're thinking of everything about. You know how you're going to set up a home for your young daughter or where you're going to locate to sell all the intricacies. An orientation to you're not probably paying attention to but if there's a first hand testimony from another officer like you said a word of mouth that may have much more impact. For you for those exiting than a binder full of- information and both combined I think could be very valuable. Thank you again. Thank you so much for joining us I will go ahead and transition. Thank you. Right I would. But now lives to call up our second panel the first we have a steep pack who is the president of US backs. And then we have to keep Portland who's the deputy secretary of veteran's services for Calvet. And Nancy Montgomery who is the assistant dean health wellness and better service is Irvine valley college. And finally hiding Marshall managing director. Riverside county. Riverside county something I'm sure. Allen thank you all for joining us today we go ahead and start with Mister. Much. A good morning of my name is Steven pack on the. I should president and CEO of your steps I'm also a Vietnam veteran. And I've been working with homeless veterans assistance in nineteen ninety one. I bit down Orange County several times in the past years that you have as- Orange County of struggle as many counties have without their homeless veteran issue. I within the US has been serving up veterans since nineteen ninety three- we started in Los Angeles that are in the website. And now have expanded to eleven different communities across country the house. About fifty five hundred dead better ends and everything. They have a variety of programs response to the homeless crisis that we all face. I'm also the president of the California search veterans service agencies seven agencies. And are California- providing housing and services from Eureka to San Diego. Level two of benefit to veterans. Right now are Orange County like of most county are- offering from a shortage of affordable housing you're always more or of veterans and other homeless people becoming homeless and- then there's nothing available so it is obvious to us that housing own is not the answer when you need a variety of solutions- with your three hundred or so almost veterans- you can multiply that by two and a half so. And comes out to about a thousand veterans are experiencing homeless homelessness- every year- so we have to attack. This problem from a variety of different angles. US vets has a transitional housing program both both transitional and bridge programs. Of we have almost prevention programs- and a permanent support of housing programs- and between the three of those we hope that we will get ahead of this problem. Of the trend transitional housing programs. Are largely funded by the a grant and per diem program that the program has been flat line. Across the country but the transitional housing gives us the funding to hire more staff so we can provide more intensive services those are rehabilitation programs. For a while I think transition hasn't got a bad name it was you know ninety days route ten people were getting into permanent housing but- of the way a- we have redesigned as he a as redesigned program is that. Instead of the behavior health assessments we are doing housing tests how do we get them- into housing. Of veterans have a variety of issues. Before they become homeless you could be of- lack of a job the could subsidies could be mental illness. Of opportunity lack of employment of a whole variety of things that we have to deal with those issues- really before stabilizer the veterans that's why. We feel- and we also advocate that transitional housing programs are are a key part of this continuing. To get veterans from the street into a program house. But we also need to look up stream. To homes prevention. Of because of veterans are becoming homeless every day Los Angeles three or four day are becoming homeless are dropping and homelessness so we obviously have to get ahead of that and provide the services that we provide a rocket mental health and employment services. Knowing that those are two of the key factors- that are resulting in a homelessness- US vets provides health counseling at a through or outside the wire program at seven our community colleges in order county- and another seven in- Los Angeles county. And there we are providing mental health counseling to veterans who have just come back from department of our community colleges their first step. But there's no way that they really don't know what happens beyond that in a lot of them are are suffering from come back home and we want to make sure that they deal with that early on- we're providing case management. To help them navigate- the. There post service career. Knowing that- some of them are dropped into a community and really don't know what's what steps to take next in order to. Move forward and we're providing counseling to the families. Families are dealing with- some with commentator ends who have. Are greatly disturbed by their I'm in combat and we want to help the family address that. There's a very high suicide rate among both men but a particularly. Women the veteran of suicide rate is six to twelve times higher than their sickly under parts of so it is really important that we provide discounts going on in a Broadway are are outside the program was has been privately funded for the five years that we run it just past year Orange County department mental health is picked up that funding I think it is critical that all counties look at their prevention early intervention so that they can provide this counseling to both male and a female veterans. Along with the shortage of mental health services there's a shortage of employment dollars always- as though there's the VP program our problem the state is moved around from- agency to agency there ever enough to go around and so it's a very stable program- and getting a job. Is one of the key. Issues that we can handle to make sure that veterans dog Fala to homelessness. And fine is a primitive supporting half supporter housing- in California now there is a lot of money available for. A homeless to for the construction of homeless veterans housing- and are we really have to take advantage of that- locating these are permits for the projects in the county of provides a number of nodes of- intensive services. And really stabilizes the entire homeless veteran that situation by locating the so- because this money at them we're I think we're and- round five. Around five we're gonna try to get it we're gonna try to get some more fun after that but- we have a couple more rounds before this this run this my expires we have all have to be aggressive to go out and get this money and build a housing that's going to stabilize. The homeless veterans in our community- I mention Kassar our state- advocacy agency- we have been advocating for a number of years now our initially- about appointment we are one of the key advocacy groups behind. The H. H. P. program and we are now moving into battle health knowing that another critical issue. We did a state of the veteran community report. Of this past year this year's our second. Report. To get a clear sense of. It which counties are providing veterans services and which are not. Most are not most are not coordinating count of veterans services with county services and I think that's a critical. Of people here that we want to fix. Aside from the issues that I've already mentioned- there's been a notable absence of partnerships between parents specific agencies and counties. There's a lot generally Oct of access to better treatment courts. And we are now focusing on aging veterans aging veterans are becoming a larger part of the homeless population I think we have to look ahead to or what services are we need our take care of that population so that. They don't they don't remain on the street- so I would encourage everyone to look at our website the California veterans dot org that- stated the veteran- report is on there. As I mentioned that to nearly every day of. Our everyday several veterans are falling into homeless is- nearly every day veterans are dying street I think it's critical that we address this problem in an aggressive way- both are. All the better and- this specific parts of funding county funding state funding we all have to advocate together to. Bring the services difference to prevent them from remaining in homelessness thank you. Thank you for the opportunity here today- let this one up I want to thank the veterans who were. By their- their testing isn't. The only woman cursed said their their store. See you can conversation of how it doesn't immediately leading though many other things Steve just mentioned which is you know employment education physical mental health- just it there's a there's a holistic process here that. Way we at the department of Veterans Affairs are very aware of and- worked very closely with our nonprofit providers in our county system our community college system and various others and if there's any encouragement here today it seems that some of that process did work- some of the folks family and see they found Steve shop. And that makes a big difference that that means they're tied into us that means they're tied and the rest of their community resources so. That is encouraging on obviously a lot of this is. You know has it has historically been a challenge with the department of defense. On some of the transition process people wonder why why why is it so difficult for service members and- everyone looks at the type of services their experiences within the service but it's just it's really fundamental. It's your leaving an organization at your part of your basically moving perhaps in in relocating to a new area. Or coming back to an area where you've been. Detached from for some period of time- with unemployment. Or within like made like the- German said today that with employment in place but once again that's new appointments you don't know if that's always going to work out it's just a very. Unstable transitional period of time. And you know. It's no surprise that the department fences is underperforming terms of getting their- their service members ready for that transition when they- when they get out. So here in state we've obviously taken that our responsibility for that very seriously with the support of the legislature and the governor- we've been able to put some great programs in place and one of which- assembly member when you mentioned was cal top program. A program we're very proud of and now we're on all military installations within the state and providing. On transitional services to those members who desire that- it's not mandatory we can't make them go- we ask all of those that have any intentions on standing California please take part because a lot of a- lot of information for them and they level that is very. Locally specific- connect them with their local CVS so connects them with my out reached out. There and all the other community resources available. Our representatives from the community college system common talk about the- local educational opportunities- I have staff come and educate them on. Their educational benefits department consumers affairs comes in and provide some information on how to avoid predatory practices. Veterans benefits- but this is all it's all one big thing- as Steve mentioned we recently Steve does a wonderful job with. With Nancy and work with outside the wire program to get that on community colleges here Orange County which is a model that we took in with our prop sixty three fund- recently worked with with Steve's organization and LA to get that same program on to the- the twenty three community college systems. US campuses within the LA area. So. Can't stress enough the prop sixty three money that each county. Housing is available- and better it's not veterans specific but better answer one of the populations and not. That fall under the usage of that funding so- it's very important for every county tap into that in. And work with the base providers to make the most of that money within their county which is obviously supporting many of these housing programs- California. We do have the veterans housing homes prevention program. We we've we've kind of re look at the way we look at housing within our department and- want to provide a continuum of care. We've just we've- we've always had a farm and home loan program is- offers purchasing opportunities for folks- wonderful program incredibly successful for decades and decades. However the only folks that were ready for that. Take that step towards their California Dreamin own their own home could apply on an obviously as we know a better answer. Over represented in the homes population so clearly we have some work to do on that end- and then we always had our eight homes as well. So we had some housing options but obviously a lot of gaps so with the re purposing of some of the bond money we had six hundred million at the time. We were able to really bridge a lot of those gaps anywhere from a merchant housing through transitional to permit supportive to affordable on then ideally have the option for ownership there are farming home all program and then obviously later on in life on being able to reside in one of our veterans home to try to create that continuum of housing for. The provided by the department. Many credibly successful thus far- sixty two projects have been awarded the first four rounds about three hundred and nine million of that six hundred million have gone out- interestingly enough the first project the came online was right here in Orange County was potter's leading. It was a program that was- created a put on very rapidly because they you- shipping containers to reform and to build the units- so very very good. Program it's been often running for a couple years now. So that that's moving along well as I said much of that is it's a long. Some of it's got 25% of those units are affordable at the twenty four units. Online to the sixty two programs are without 25% being affordable- another 25% Being permits supportive- I don't remember the exact numbers on some of the others but those are two of the big the big areas only one thing to note on Steve mentions a bit too is only 15% of those units as far have been for. Families on. When you look at better ends in the units available particularly females with children- our numbers are. It's hard to grasp of this but our number Chau there's less than five hundred units statewide available at the moment or- for women with children men with children for that matter. There's a lot lot of challenges around serving a population- là security issues that I think were mentioned here today- in a for a variety other issues around some of the- some the additional barriers that folks might have. On the take a little more cultural competency in order to serve that population and make it a little tougher which I think maybe. Why they are under represented in what's of available to them. But moving forward that certainly a target of ours the- funds had been distributed I think early on LA- as as kind of expected to the lion's share of a lot of the money- but it is balanced out. Quite nicely- Orange County. We I don't think there's two projects going on an Orange County right now neither have. The H. H. P. funding available to them the Santa Ana veterans village program in the Placentia veterans- village. And mercy housing jamboree housing to doing those- one one part of our program we really love it and I know the Santa Ana veterans village I'm not sure I want to speak for. The forty but be here to pull century. But one thing about the PhD program is really unique. But I think it's can change the way the state is looking at housing overall. Is that it require this element of words or with- on. Working with groups like caps so which caps. So was. Was at the front of five. Redirecting that six hundred million towards this purpose- they advocated very hard initially to have that would support services would be required as part of the agreement for the development. Developer gets the grant until they have a supportive services- package approved by my shop- which were very excited about because clearly as we mentioned that as I started off today there's a there's a variety of other issues that go along with. With being almost any pre addressed to. Citizens so once again thanks for the opportunity to be here today and I'm interested to hear what everyone else has to say and we're certainly here to assist anyway we can thank you. Thank you Mister Boyle ms Montgomery. Thank. Okay hi I just want to interrupt just really briefly you've come up in the lobby I can the last two years and that the program you have it really still as well for the state and if we could get something that every community college we would really be serving our veterans idents thank you so much and you've been wonderful to aye you were first assembly member we came to her that finding it you open your door and your arms and greed everything from there so I have to thank you for that too along with John bang who was with you on that part too so. I appreciate everything you've done I do you explain that program just what that is exactly so yeah sure so we have at Irvine valley college we have the veteran resource center there and we consider it kind of a best practice resource center because we're an overall complete stop so every type of service that we have in this state or any institution we offer right there we have certified Fishel's be able perhaps in there we have disability certification we have and everything's on site it's not like there we have to resource them out we have- through U. S. about bats outside where we have four days a week of mental health- provisions for. Our veterans specific so they're actually train from the be a when they come in and work with our veterans so they're used to working with combat- military sexual assault the main issue suicide ideation those type of things- we offer all types of emergency finds we aye right consistent grant so that we can provide a lot more services we anything. To do with them we provide. Money. One stop and that's what kind of makes this a little bit different than most of the other veterans throughout the state which is nice- my background is. Military it's nursing so I look at it more of a holistic view that kind of brings a little bit more medical and mental health to it. Which I think promotes that wellness part of it too so I think that helps- and I'm a date a nerd too so just real briefly I want to give you some of the data. In Orange County we have over twelve thousand veterans that attend the nine community colleges. Throughout the state we have over ninety thousand that attend the hundred and fourteen community college. A recently we have an innovation grant that we went out and did a study. And we look at what's going on in these hundred fourteen community colleges out of that we were able to access a hundred and six because- the other eight did not really have services on their campus for veterans. When we went out there we hired our P. group to come out big evaluation for they did focus groups they did. A small groups of veterans they talked with we did tons of surveys we did over fifteen hundred surveys with veterans so we got a pretty good. Glimpse of what we're looking at. We do specifically talk about housing because there's so many application- issue we had a look at. But in the snapshot. They did. Talk about living arrangements living arrangements with other. 79% of our veterans live with others- alone with nineteen percent. And then homeless was 3% and that's what we got out of only those fifteen hundred. There are those still sleeping in their cars commuting back and forth and going from there that we don't usually find out about. Until somebody speaks up and says that which then we can. Enact our services and go from there. I think that we have a lot of. Resources recently through this innovation grant we held. A conference at Irvine valley college and we had a- two hundred attendees from community colleges. Some for four years what we did was put together had my step put together a binder. And I think this binder something that we've got to get out a lot more because people need the resources they need the templates they need the information. I used Calvet to put together some information. L. A. homeless. Indeed our groups that provide housing there. So throughout here we have all this hopefully we keep adding to this. We have intake forms with certified official information counselors. But inside the- other part is information about how to access food. There Calvet brash how to get on food pantries. Because a lot of people don't look at those things they don't know how to get to a- it. Also through a complete list of housing. At any other Calvet office in LA put this together and then I have- been dials put it together for us in the Orange County office of these are. Available housing for veterans that they can apply to and hopefully get into. Some are a little bit difficult because they do require vast vouchers the bash doctor system I think needs a little over hall here- I think we need. A lot more easier access to those vouchers but also we need a lot more outside apartment owners willing to accept those vouchers and- follow up with that- it. This goes over a lot of great resources. I talked about what we need their- part of the emergency. Grants that we hand out our to put down their first month payment. It's to pay for utilities that they can't pay for that they can afford we offer on any type of clothing that type of things and it comes out of all these grants that we actually bright. Eyed and provide for them. You would be surprised at you were Christopher talk he has three children and his wife. His bills every month there were six thousand dollars him as wife together bring in six thousand dollars he was working in the evenings. And on. To trying to. Get some more funds their history three little babies which baby sitting alone in orange. If you've ever looked up that cost it ranges anywhere from twelve hundred to eighteen hundred dollars. And that's only for one child. So we put all of these type of- beer years that they're trying to. Navigate through any. Makes it very difficult to school could be. Done. I'm a calling Danny that's on his real name but it we're gonna calling the need for today. He's come on and off to our- college he takes music classes he takes different classes he's in his early sixties he's- probably the most sweetest manual ever meet he was a boxer in the army. So we actually went to the Olympic Olympics and box. So needless to say when he he never saw combat but when he got out he still had that type of- problem with mental stability. Because of the boxing because of his background there so he has a lot of trauma to the brain there- pretty much similar to a ninety D. when you look at that. The concussions and all the things that happened with boxers he's been very unstable with his living. He was housed with a church an Orange County and they let him live in this back room for years well. Last year they sold the church. So they displace but the pastor bought him a ban. And he's and he's obsessed with computers he always says he owns six companies in he's doing all these computer things will counter intelligence and he's just. A kick to listen to but a great man but he- became just place but these pastor bottom advance we've been living in his band we had not seen him since last June. He walked into our center. Just the last few weeks and- it will be unbearable. How he had not changed his clothes he had this huge long beard. But it was still anyways the happiest man in the world and he said he starting all these wonderful companies again and he's doing all these things that. Not once have my veterans ever ever degraded him and Brough to him. At any point they offering free food the offering everything that they can that's one of our veterans. Are resource center offers is we have a refrigerator with food that we partner with Orange County. Rescue mission we Starbucks. Tax and sandwiches in there so they would give him sandwiches more and make sure he could eat into all. These things. Well one day I went in there and I said. What is going on here does not smell clean in here. And they said well you know we have this problem he's coming in he's not beating and I said then we got. Take care about. So I said my new director maillot and I said. All of the guys said go to target you buy anything he needs I want new clothes and you know I'm sure sucks whatever he needs to get it for my in getting. All these things and get him done well. Malik took a step further so. He asked me of any when's the last time he had baited and- he said not for awhile. So we took him to the gym he watched what clothes he had. And gave them all these new clothes. And in the shower. This is kind of a tear jerker in the shower he ask Danny. When's the last time you Bates and he said three months ago. And he had the scrubber thing maillot did any scrap demi said Nancy there was brown water coming down the shower and he said it just broke my heart. So they shave them and got him all cleaned up and they brought him back and- he's there now every Monday to get a shower with mall any good to the GM and make sure it is clean and we washes clothes in the gym. He still lives in his van I can't get him house so we got him social security about a year ago because he doesn't qualify or any type of be a money he is a hundred dollars a month that's not enough to really house himself. We've got to do better than that. This man deserves better he's the nicest man in the world but I can't find in housing I can't get him anywhere so along those lines I want you to keep thinking of Mel but I've got to ask for you. So my number one ask is that we do find transitional housing for veterans you heard our veterans up you're speaking about that. They don't get their funds for the first few months when they come to us in the application they they apply for the education benefits they have to wait out its it again you were Brian state it came to December he started classes in August. That's too long to wait and most of them they don't keep their finances really well to where he was lucky. At seven thousand dollars in the bank most don't have that. We need to be able to career test. Our veterans before they even leave the base and find out where they want to go. I had a young man the other day. That has been he signed up for all these computer classes. And he called me in and actually he was an attending class. And I called him and I said so what's going on because he's teacher sent me an email and said that. He Robert in email said he had suicidal thoughts opinion at all. So I called them personally and I said what's going on I said I need to talk to you now and I asked him those important questions in. And got his information. But he said to me I don't want to be in those classes and I said. What do you want to do and he said. I I've I've tried to look into barber school. Will lo and behold the GI bill will cover barbers. So he in boulder barber school we transferred over is benefits he's now in those classes becoming a barber. But we've got a career test that could have been easily settled when he came out. We've also got to have a lot more. In turn programs- maybe even to find out what they want. And increase our certificated programs. Because they are coming out and I say this all the time. With experience. Plumbing electrical activity. Diesel mechanics they need to be able to get into these union programs get their certificate of completion maybe knock off a couple years because of their experience and get important. Maybe some are not going to come to college we hope they do but they may not want to but we gotta get amend ploy that's really vital. And the last thing that I want really really focus on and I think I don't care across the board we have to treat for mental health regardless if they ask for it. When they are coming out of the military when they're entering the colleges every student should go through a mental health not only assessment but you know what we're just going to treat you anyways we're gonna give you tools and skills on everyday life situations that we can get you through. And I will tell you right now there's not one person on this planet that could not benefit from a program like that because life is hard and it doesn't matter if you're in the military not you at that on top of it. It makes it even more difficult so why not just treat we've got to take a more holistic approach on how we help our veterans that's what we are doing it Irvine valley ninety we're making great strides in again meeting in that date a nerd our persistence rates have improved. Immensely we have an Xin rate are are depressed rates have decreased immensely we've started out when I first started in this five years ago and testing in getting our surveys and data collection in. And I do it through research department so it's pretty. Solid we started out in the high like sixty seven to eighty percent. In an exciting we're down 212214% now that makes a difference because we treat them regardless if they say it. And I think that's a by. Our hope providers coming out and they sit in there and just help focus groups and talking Kobe goals. And the right in the- center and I. Ask that's what I'd like you to do and try and see what you can do. You guys already made great strides- so I appreciate an anthem thank you very much for your time. Thank you and the news Marshall. Hi being thank you so much for calling in your committee to talk about ending better at home my name is Marshall I manage director of the river county. Development agency- in the nineteen years that I've been in county government work I can tell you that the highlight in nineteen years was getting a phone call. In twenty sixteen from then hud secretary young Castiel to let us know that our site county was the first letter county in the United States to reach a functional zero in ending veteran homelessness so I'm so thrilled to be able to share that. Story with you it's been a few years. We get to relive it is just a treat for me thank you. I'm in twenty. In twenty thirteen was when the riverside County Board of supervisors- initiated a an initiative called valor and what they did was. Tell all of the department heads that they wanted to and we must and the veteran homelessness. During that time and as part of valor we established a sub committee to address homelessness one to address unemployment and another one to address. Poverty in general. Back in twenty thirteen the point in time count for homeless veterans riverside county showed that there are two hundred and eighty five homeless veterans living in riverside county at the time. Little did we know. By a few months later we would of our the house about a thousand of. During the five year period from. Twenty thirteen to twenty seventeen apartments community agencies and the woman the health system work lab Ridley to build a coordinated system one that. Really had of a culture that prioritize rapid registration our armed housing of all homeless veterans. In June of twenty thirteen we held our first veteran to boot camp and that was convene to buy a an organization called community solutions I do recall on that you were there for that- Mister. It was just such a pleasure to work with you then and it is a pleasure to be part of the thing the that you find yourself in a few years later. Now I reflecting back on the work that we did I think there's a few factors are critical to our success one of them was leadership. The router initiative was created and champion by our board of supervisors that was critical in getting the community support and the by and that we- be required they also directed all of the county departments to make ending veteran homelessness the top priority of the work that they were establishing. Number two was disability the Valar initiative with highly visible it was a community campaign which included the park from. Local churches and community residents this week. Number three we had very strong community partnerships staff from multiple agencies work very closely Allen at on a daily basis. To house veterans at that time we were holding weekly. Calls and we literally went down the list of every single veteran that we need in the pipeline. To find out where they were in the process so that there was a an urgency to the matter on a daily basis. Number four one we have a vicious cycle. The bachelor valor housing team set out and we didn't think we could do this to reestablish this goal set out to house one hundred veterans in the first one Hundred Days of the initiative and at the end of that one hundred days they quickly and successfully house the hundred and forty of them. I can tell you at the time I in my county career I was working at the Housing Authority is. Actor and I do recall the passion. The drive and the excitement in the office a each and every time. One homeless person was house there was just a celebration around the office and it just made the work. On believable and it was something I'll never forget. If we hadn't set that large bowl in the first place I don't think we move we would have moved as quickly. Number five is housing resources. We the housing authority at that time had secured over six hundred Vash marchers a hundred and fifty two section eight project based vouchers and develop two hundred and seventy five affordable housing units. All of which were earmarked for homeless veterans you really cannot and homeless. Homeless veterans. Issues without housing resources. And then the last thing I think is a developing a by name lest we developed a community wide list all homeless veterans and sought to house each and everyone of them since then since the inception of that initiative we've house one thousand seven hundred and nine voucher homeless veterans taxes yesterday morning and I can tell you that I couldn't be part of our team. For having accomplished a great feat. Thank you. Q. tall for review and I know that we have a few questions here so we'll start with the spelling are you north. Martel and miss Montgomery thank you both for being here both have. Done something across the state that I think is recognized as a best practices as a family member or Nguyen side it as something that we hold out as a model for other communities. And I guess my question is I'm probably I think I have for you Mister Boylan is how can we as a state do a more effective job at identifying best practices and then rolling them out across the state I think that's nay we struggle with and just when it comes to veterans issues but I think more broadly by. How can we do better can we take a pro they're working so well riverside working so well at. IBC and roll those out of the state. Thank you. It's it was interesting I think early on. Veterans issue really I mean obviously we're so I I've I working or not. Cisco for many years. There was this period of this law all I'd say eight ninety Gulf War was over- Vietnam veterans are still primary population of veterans being served any any supportive services. Environments goal for veterans that were seen very is antiseptic in some ways and in there aside from the hundreds of thousands of veterans who it shop a BA with various illnesses related their goal for service that along to be a side of it is the that part but- in terms of the community the homelessness issue that. All these things really hadn't come to the- or for it yet- after the post nine eleven veterans started coming back in an educational benefits in in in and I think the whole system itself was shocked on non profits the hippest nonprofits I mean one to really have their fingers on the polls really needed to shift the way they serve veterans the population shifted on them almost overnight. On the needs of veteran shifted rapidly everything moved- and the population of those in need increased dramatically so at the time governor brown with through executive order- put in place was called the governor's entering city council on veterans what this did was said com one. All from all over the state anyone who's doing anything related to veterans- better specific or not- comes Sacramento we we're going to convene and figure. Out who's doing what where and we're gonna make sure Reno's charter. It's quite an undertaking- in it was. It was a little hard to get our arms around I was on the nonprofit side of the world at that time. On this take place was really. Really excited to see. What what it did was it introduced me to Nancy and introduced me that why new Steve from before but it there just be a lot of people and everybody started looking around and knowing. You know basically when with when that mapping of sorts was done. We knew who was doing what where and to what level and what they're in in when we realized we needed to start. Drilling down into the gap identify the gaps in then the service there provided you know first of all is establishing the needs than establishing. The services available and establishing the gaps. So we really work through this in a very systematic way- when I cannot state was a priority that- then secretary gravity in doctor Abbas Yanni when he came in has just hit the ground running on this and we really focused on. Organizing the state in a way in breaking it down regionally and identifying those Lee partners within the state and making sure they're connected to the team originally. And then the all the service providers within our cohesive within that community as well so you have a community based system of care state is aware of an educated to within every communities throughout the state. And that's something that we're very proud of and we've done very systematically that led right into what cal top is which is our own California transition assistance program. We identified very early on. That that was the challenged. He was center folks off without a lot of state without a lot of support they were coming to the state- and then suddenly find themselves in need of something- and Austin and we where they're at and them not knowing who to turn to. So that's where Calvet really tell tap really sprung from in using all of those resources and all those community partners is starting to develop these relationships. It allowed us to understand what funding challenges there were what funding was available that was being used how could we partner. For funding how can we really utilize what we Pat. I mean to see what happened in LA is outstanding San Diego was kind of a give me it it's up is already kind of. Not giving it was it's a hard work. But you have a very culturally competent area you have everybody who's involved in knowledgeable about veterans issues to some because they're touched in some way. In that community it's a very military rich environment LA LA a completely different type of place on. So it took a lot more work in it still takes a lot of work. But in California rural areas for the biggest challenge is trying to develop some system of caring community based system of care in rural areas were very limited. Access to on any kind services. Are around. So to answer your question what that's kind of process our department went through to understand in identified in through this process like I said. We identified Nancy how to best practice of working with Steve. To get his outside the wire program on to the community college campuses group. Prop sixty three grant that she got to the Orange County. Well I have my own prop sixty three money that our department gets in in the legislature they missed. That last year so I had more to offer. So hearing one Nancy done I work with Steve. And department of Veterans and- in general long who's in charge. She I guess it you call the CVS so. Little different LA the called the military department of Los Angeles- who had that up we work with her so now we have a program. That we've actually added to it so we have a mental health treatment but also now. General long have staff goes to they actually do claims as well so now we have folks going to the community colleges throughout LA. Will do claims assistance and mental health. So it's those kind of things as we see them as they go along. We just work on the fly but now we can is the state agency be that nimble. Because we set up the structure throughout the state the we understand who all the players are and what roles they play. Down to the community level system of support so. That's that's the biggest thing is I mean this. My challenge. I think being in the nonprofit world I. Can see this pretty. Easily the state has a hard time in in in many different apart. Getting the money from the legislature to the street. I mean that that's that is the biggest challenge that you can develop amazing programs but how do you get that money onto the street in used effectively- and I think that something is department we're very proud of and I think we've managed to- figure out ways to do that quite effectively. Quick question. What is the what's the budget for the program that we have at IBC right now. So there's no. There are users so there's no better resource center in the state has an actual general fund budget their college so we my budget there is probably one of the biggest budgets because we were grant so I have a two million dollar that's an innovation grant that we can at a utilized for. Different events about it's included in mental health- we're doing a lot of experimental private type of thing so we're taking veterans off campus and we're seeking how mentally they handle these things if it if it actually improves their mental health status and improve that isolation factor of being isolated maybe they have no support at home or what have you so we're doing those pre and post surveys and we're finding out what's working. On the other money that we have coming in I have an Orange County community foundation grant I also a minute I'll service grants from prop sixty three- and so when he finds that we have coming in that makes up my- budget the other part we have is- assembly woman Irwin I advocated for with our our actual on. Going funding so we are now in the state it. And I'm going finding and how they base that is the number of veterans that you certify per year so we have to send in a certification from. From be a once in Chau what we're doing. The problem with that is that colleges with a large amount of veterans that they certify say San Diego. They get like a hundred sixty thousand dollars my college I certify a smaller amount even though I care for eight hundred veterans I don't certify that me I sort of a little bit over three hundred. And then during that time they give us a time for I only get forty eight to fifty thousand dollars so it's not enough to sustain positions. So for our budgets are not. Stable across the state in any better resource center so. There isn't any really. Okay and one more question to a suggestion that we heard from. Our veterans. And also for me. With concepts as- transitional housing with your- definition and we usually years. Where you actually have. A. Housing while you are making that transition from military to civilian life for a period of a month or six weeks whatever what do you think about that idea. I as polls I think it's a great idea I don't control that money and so I don't want to spend it for them. But I can certainly could I I'll certainly have ideas- but I think there's that there's something there that there's something there there. Because it's a need it's across the board in your you know it it's- the housing crisis is isn't not. Veteran thing has a center proportionally represented but it's students students better in a non throughout the state at the same challenge- so that there's probably a bigger solution hand as well but at as a deals with veterans in the use of the money. That I think fifteen million dollars on going is just incredible I mean there was a time when there was actually no support for the community college so that was a- that was and I mean. And a significant. List left to say the least so that there's probably some things that can be done there- and we'd certainly be be happy part of that conversation in. In in. Throw in our two cents in our ideas for certain. Assembly member quirk Silva. Again thank you to all the panelists and I know that I've met some of you as I worked in that area a tiny bit I believe were you doing the pensions religion Long Beach a handful of years ago and I went out with John Spangler. At that point and I was very intrigued by the village this is but six years ago. I believe. Because it had many of the attributes that we're talking about from. A women in family unit to a guardian which I've always been struck by gardens as that's how I ended up becoming political twenty years ago at the school I taught at where we started a community garden and that was where. Literally the seeds were planted- and I'm not being obnoxious there but but guardians and people and wellness there's a huge amount of research on that. But it was not only the transitional house but that it was the permanent supportive in if you haven't been out there right- Chen site tour because- that has always kind of stayed in the forefront but one of the things that I do want to ask about is. Because the potters. Elige was mention and I also went out to tour that. Is that housing not just for the veterans community but every community seniors millennials all of us. Is becoming out of reach and I know that we get very. Excited by new approaches and that was containers but- Los Angeles and even here were finding that some of the affordable housing models are becoming more and more- out of reach even if they're affordable so for example I've heard in Los Angeles and I could be wrong that the four WD could cost well over six hundred. Thousand dollars to build but there are models out there that we've seen in other places where there the prefab ideas that matter talked to a gentleman who works in Los Angeles he just went out to Panama last week to help set up for their government I thousand units in its a pre fab where it's all folds and believe it or not if you see the model it opens it up it opens up into a two bedroom with showers. A small kitchen the cost to create that's about twenty three thousand dollars now of course you have to have the infrastructure and all that to go but- is there any type of modeling being done and again this is housing and not only veterans housing that we could look at it that could be much more economical. They can be built Shasta- any cheaper not because I want people to live in cheap homes but because we want to get the most mileage out of the dollar we. AB are there any of those things you're looking out. Of. Are there are there is a lot of experiments out- tiny homes is one- homes on wheels this is another- so we're just getting everything up there that. Cost. Are you aspects long what are our partners century housing and Thomas opera searches are looking housing at the west LA via campus. Will be developing two hundred units of housing. Over the next five or six years. Residents struggle district we have to renovate what is their of so the that the- less expensive. Housing options are not available at that point but we are also working with architects who have done a lot of- experiment là research on this and they are looking at modular buildings. These are to be containers day design a building such that they can replicate each apartment. A single factory and stack them up and they put a. They they put a- a front on and it doesn't look like a much of the building they're beautiful. So there's all kinds of things- being experimented. Is it getting it's a matter of getting land. Counties and cities have a lot of land metro has of land- so matter of the city's coming up with that lapses that. Agencies like ours on the development agencies can could put out. And then without stepping into murky waters here. And this I also when I was Ana veterans chair myself in at that time it will on the consultant for the Veterans Committee John Spangler will also took a delegation out to- the veterans campus on in Los Angeles. Is that where they had built a housing. The hospital remember the veterans hospital. The west of the S. western idea yes yeah and there was a big issue at that time where they had built a housing but the kitchen and all these issues around the- government the state working together. But there was a huge amount of land there and- then we drove on to this site it was striking he not only how much land. But a lot of the land was being leased out to other vectors whether it be a theater. Now and again the murky water plan not trying to. Say let's just all uses but on the trail and transitional type of housing and again I know we have homeless advocates out there. But they could we do something as simple as and again not Holden pizza but even getting some of our- car dealers to maybe donate motor homes and if they say you had a fifty of those. And that became a transitional living chest not- I mean you have to separate but if you had. Some of the military the military returning but not homeless. But they need to navigate and that you can have them be on a site like that for say one month two months three months and then. Access other services because I think get the pyramid sometimes we do the reverse which is. We treat something once it's huge problems over there. As homeless now of all of these layers do but if we. For that same thing in the school system. But. G. into people were incarcerated verses the preventive Chinese after school programs at the age of it so we could have a model on land whether it's veterans lander other surplus California land that we could work with the private sector. To do I mean a donation of motor homes that are nice I'm not talking fifty thousand dollar motor homes but moderate they could say here's a place you have all this kind of a wood stick- hub here. And there's a time line I. Think those are some creative approaches that. Could in the short term help but in the long term- keep some of the veterans getting to the cycle. He like many because in the end we're going to have it have some type of intervention anyhow- for those that don't put that intervention were seen them dying on our streets. So we're doing things in Los Angeles- as I said we're developing at that west of the land. It's a long term project- we don't break ground. On the first billing and all next year. But demi while. The a is working with the city and the county to our create bridge housing on the line I want to create a hundred beds a bridge housing using one of those from instructors- that's one that there's a new director up their doctor Stephen Braverman- and he is suggesting that the put modular homes are. On the land. On the V. a site on the VA site. There's a there's plenty of land there okay I'm gonna have to do is that correct because if you've been. To it it is up to the campus is a very large hand campus right on the- edges. Of. Is it Westwood. Yes my press one to one is so you had this beautiful campus in on the edges you have that trends that are dying on the streets all this grassy rolling hills on the VA and to me it's a crime so. Thank you. I'd might have answered most of my questions just kind of quickly. It is sometimes a disconnect with timing and Alan so- yeah I think it's kind of intriguing when you talk about doing career counseling ahead of time before they get into the community college because the information you're- the opportunities and community college by the time. Veterans here about him off their off in another direction and specifically a job with of the trades we have our carpenters inventor county are very active in trying to. Recruit veterans but- what we're not going telling community college students to apply for that because they are allegedly going into debt different direction and yet it might be exactly the thing that's right for them so I so- introducing them earlier to the opportunities- before they're- at a community college I think. An official and maybe that through cal tap or or being- you know that's on the- the bases and then at the same time I've also heard from veterans. Hey Nancy veterans that have come that has. Talk about how they have this transition program the military and yet they're not ready to absorb most of the information and so being able to hear all the second I maybe that's on the campuses would be beneficial and so I hope that cal is looking now after based place the programs on the bases that they- move into. Unity colleges also. We are in and that's the one of the biggest challenges because even. Unfortunate that the governor's military council the post commanders throughout the state we have been incredibly receptive in any known and I. Hill this used to be a sore spot for me when I was in the nonprofit world Sir if I said the department of. Is doing what they can and they've gotten so much better trying to you know there's some salsa please post they're they're doing everything they can it's hard. To hard deal there folks leaving going back to all every nook and cranny country. But then like I said we try to identify those books that have some interest or have no or or think they may stay in California. But I think. Even in what they give us is a separate day so they have to week that the gentleman earlier talked about. Of which is that DLL. Labor federal funded- kind of employment crash course resume writing how to prepare for interview type stuff with a very small bit from the for the federal be a on back. To just kind of drinking from a fire hose and- you know it's- the- cover everything that they- support of that flies to. Cheat depending on whether your what your age is how long you been and what your- kids all these different tack so it's just a lot a- lot of stuff to take in. What we do is they've they've afforded us a separate day. Where we bring universal art is just our date cal. Day I'm- now not to bring it. On folks and they have this opportunity the best part of the whole day at the end of everything. Is the media. Like for your area they meet then for Orange County they meet our local interest in network quirk. Who is the outrage person for that community they meet their actual county veterans service officer for that community. So it is forget let's pretend they don't listen to and hold other thing and just say you know I want to pay attention this once I get out. They will have. The contact information for the link who. Links are we require. Them to know. Everything about the community and in. Every entry point in that system to be connected to that system so that. That better and regardless of what entry point they pick based on their own personal demographics. We will be able to communicate with them. And then also they have that county veterans service officer's name phone number. Contact information. And at that point the one thing that I can't get federally from all that. The twenty five thousand letters a come back to the state every year. From the DOD but what I get through this process is their personal email. So we can connect with them directly which is. Just everything and that is the biggest challenge with Pat- and been able to so yes we do have that. Connection so. Even if whatever we don't give them at that point we can continue to connect to the but I agree. In into your point apprenticeships to so when you work with the trades the GI bill covers apprenticeship programs as well which is an amazing way to use your GI- and it goes a lot further in employers love it and- their statements still is. In use wall in paid so it's just a win for everybody. Yeah and at that it didn't have to be Nancy. Tell them- used to qualify you could have qualified to go directly to you see. Sense and it could not be Nancy saying maybe you don't. To go the- the four year degree route you really. Love to work with your hands in the carpenters have these apprenticeship programs there so it's- it's really. It's a timing issue that that people the information at. The time that they- that they most need at night I. It's a difficult. It's difficult to get that correct. But those are the two issues that I've. Get out community college they can get the vets can get all their information but I have had a number of people say if somebody would have just told me I could have gone straight to. You see a or cal state at that that I had the credentials to do that. We've been trying to get with the military commanders as much as we can and go in and kind of go back as far as we can before they get out of it. Is the gentleman mentioned today that they gave him this course eight months prior. The reason behind that is they're trying to give a year prior actually. In the reason behind that is. In theory. It's call transition jeep. Goals and- G. P. S. strategies. So what the military does not wither tap program is a year out there's they're supposed to take an individual. And identified the path with. That individual wants to go down. Whether that. Cellphone business whether that's going to school or if it's going into a trade the military ideal to their new track to chat jeep. Transition GPS program is supposed to identify those three passed. A year before they even get out then that last year in theory they're supposed to work towards that passive that's when they would go through this process they would figure out if they're ready for associates for. Communications the issuer UC system they would figure out what trade if they wanted to put on trade because back to the career testing that's ideally when they're supposed to be doing that. On whether that's done how it's done it's not mandatory that part of the course is not mandatory so we have very little. Affect on that process- but through our relationships with our military posture in the state we're trying to at least in California as much as we can- reach back. In get involved as far as we can- is far as dole le let us. Assembly and just how many non not. The process is that were talking about are not only important for our military also our young the Dahle milk multi also. An example on the rear testing. Ran a bill through the Education. Committee exactly on going back. Sometime in their senior year preferably their. Last semester to go through the career type of processing and it didn't have to be Acosta could be going online to one. And we did not get that through the education community. A which you would think like why would that be it's not because we see all too often the same thing is that we have the students are on track to go to the four year maybe even they're going to two year but they don't know that down the street in my district. Particularly with the apprentice ironworkers program apama nobody Orange County knows that but it's a four year apprentice program many of the- those that complete that program are making well over twenty five dollars an hour working on. At Disneyland at the Star Wars build buildings are where is basically- we have the carpenters union and one of park- four year apprentice program and so just even working with the high schools let alone our military to try to get that information you would think that. Shouldn't be as complicated but believe me I almost feel like- just making the flyer to show on the pathways these are all the- type of professions that are right here within your county and I think we've talked about that before so maybe to between this hearing. At us up here and all the good ideas we can come out with that type of. The you know like these are right here if you don't have to pay eighty thousand dollars for a certificate when you can get paid to be an apprentice. And that not only good for a vet. But it's good for our young adults. Thank you so much thank you and I up on this last I just have to did you have the one comment I wanted to say on that that. Is in line with what cancers the state chances are guide guided. Pathways and you're supposed to be doing that. The guiding them. What type of assessment that completed and where they're going there. And one last thing I did want to comment you brought up the topic that. She forgot to mention. Mention seniors. A lot of our veterans are coming back and finding temporary housing by renting a room in seniors homes. And that is something that is viable in we should start looking at too because it helps. Fifty pulled on that one. They can do repairs around the house the senior feel safe. They can they the room it helps them financially. And I have one senior woman in Irvine area she's rents to three veterans it charges them six hundred dollars a month. That helps her because she lives on a very small amount of money per month their social security is extremely small. And she has no income but she owns the house and she does one lose it. So that's another Avenue that we can actually look at that the Bible throughout the state because we have such a large senior population coming on- we're gonna be 40% seniors pretty soon here everybody's going over sixty. But we can actually offer that type of housing by betting those individuals out. Making sure that there is some type of education prior to going into that housing for the for the veteran student and for the senior that is doing that. And I believe we could start excellent program by doing that too so that's another great thought we should think up. And you are all out of the box always. I okay I do real quick questions because we do have one more panel- for miss Marshall. You house I think he said close to fifteen hundred vets what type of housing that they go to did they go to grandma's house or did they- go to the HHT. A developments. Where did you send them all and how's the mall they pretty much all of them use start ash not yours and they use them to rent- privately owned apartments and single family homes. That was the majority of them yes. All right and then I'm not sure who can answer this in a really quickly to- but is there room for improvement of VH eighty. Are always. Of I'd have to get it again. A little while. Change that we have requested and I think there's regulations X. that is to get some of that money we now the VGH P. money- is- replenishes a bridge loan that we get we pay interest on that bridge loan so save us several hundred thousand dollars if we can get that of the change be money up front rather than it taking out the appraisal that we get okay what we may perhaps we can talk about the rest the changes after. Thank you very much this was a accident panel. Thank you so much for joining us and we'll go ahead and call of our panelists for panel three I would like to welcome. Backs he had who is with a aye Orange County ninety a- dilemma Wendy from at the Orange County Housing homeless services department. And George Sir see who's here from jamboree housing corporation being here now text you have a presentation that you're going to walk there. What we need to do to get that happened. We'll go ahead and start with you. Thank you a pleasure and a privilege to be able to be here and to talk about the work that United Way has got currently under way on our plans for- scaling this up pretty dramatically over the coming months and over the next year. As we already. Number of community the cross country have been able to reach personal zero for veterans. Check. Now three state in seventy a communities and as we heard earlier riverside is the only community and California in able to reach functions zero data. Quirk to hop I wanted to talk and share about our welcome home O. C. program- which is the program that we were fortunate enough to receive funding from the state budget and so I'm going to give you a roof over but the from talk. Specifically about our work the bat population. Home see based feedback. On the three how are three four happened a thirties he. But the difference is that people had when they were. What's this about the actual fine on board that would be willing to and- that so we are back from participation Orange County the corner apartment thirty ation from members. Housing authorities designed a ramp to help were caught. In the middle. But we make sure we keep those opened. We actually cover cost of application fee double your house. Building fees and bacon payment a lot does lose any ripping you off for the unit you are not Burke- then we also guarantee that will be appropriate levels support services provide page every. I'm sure there have been can be stabilized. We have some additional benefits to that- so we have our staff on hand to address any issues that may occur also dated damage rent cation. But some may a rock. One would not her caught out of pocket- are there any sure maybe he also a record Xin you are. Owners because of the of an in home. Insure that the rep and provide both based furniture. Per unit to be home. The hot. Make sure that those items out of storage and in turn you on. Since we launched our our program or initiative- we did a small pilot for a number of months and we scaled up in March this year and we have to date eighty three people from fifty four household. Yeah I would use a lot about you from the Orange County and the- RT the date. With that five. We're tired housing restructure me jurors and first from the county Housing Authority we also have thirty four owners in our network so have thirty four property owners who offer us units to be able to be used for this program at the moment we have an average of five point seven leases being signed a months almost six households. Every month that are moving in with their vouchers. Your program it's kind of this unique combination of bringing many different clip to the will to ensure that we can. Who have of your in hand be able to get up street and almost as quickly as possible. So the Cooper bring many players together to enter the over hurdles. Thanks for make sure that homeless. We as possible we began our veteran pilot program earlier in the summer and to date we have had thirteen. To be able to help include chilled. And this is in our account housing. Our roles hi là came to be a. The responsible for finding property owners securing unit. Work through any people that the housing expertise hired. Please units and system. Veterans responsible for complete. The better. The responsible provide a case manager hello veterans view your partner. Appointments to ensure that turned fully. In our next stage of welcome home O. C. as we are scaling up our veterans initiative we will be able to work all hard ouch is that a- issued here and Orange County. Chip Anna. I am not a high housing already are already in our. Connected veteran. County oranges March. Bill Broyles county orange cord blood and pieces from there I am. It will be so on track with nonprofit service for the part. With the fall. Of our- ending. Veteran. Going for the present case com but the. The service provider part is will there be ensuring that our partner welcome home OC program requirements currently I wanted to let you know that are least separate from when we receive an application packet until a veteran is housed. Is thirty five point eight days until they move in. And we currently have nine veterans that we're working with right now to place into housing. Our next steps for us the United Way hiring dish stop for awhile. So we can skate the only. That number caption needs sure get many trans post with the. Possible also at work the sub contracting process process. There's no simple Sir this is crucial sure. And how. We're all or work with. Just one process for referrals welcome hosted. Pretty up for awhile network met met or property in our county. Rents and are you requesting that they can assist with this endeavor. I will calls there- and there are just a couple of things as I was listening to comments earlier that I wanted to be sure to address and to just kind of bring up to the forefront- one of the focus areas for questions was just around any challenges that there may be. So I just wanted to share a couple of the challenges that we- think we may be facing or are currently facing one is around veterans with zero income and when that comes to housing sustainability and the collective work a case managers and the VA to ensure that veterans are getting access to any benefits- income is crucial for housing stability. As this is an area of our system that it would be great to have some more attention on. Another area of challenge- that we seem may come in the future is when rent increases. Are higher than what the voucher will allow for payment. And so we are looking at potentially once those twelve month leases- are kind of through- through the first year and we're looking at potential rent increase. We are anxious to make sure or to look at how there might be possible ways to supplement. Perhaps the state might be able to provide some additional funding to supplement that balance. That we're not constantly having to mayor veterans from one unit to another to meet those rent requirements. Another challenge that we are concerned about is what happens when somebody is placed into scattered site housing. Whose acuity level is actually too high for the scattered site model who needs to be at a project based permanent supportive housing units. So this is something that we are concerned about- it will require coordination between the VA the housing authorities the county the continuum of care and permanent supportive housing providers- and just something that we want to be mindful of where we can collaborate together to ensure that veterans receive the level of care. That is appropriate to their needs to keep them stabilized. And another fought just to throw out here- around national best practices so many of those communities that have successfully addressed homelessness did so because they adopted. The mers challenge instances where mers declare that they are dedicated to ending veterans homelessness and it's a way to bring publicity to the goal and the calls of ending veterans homelessness and it becomes a rally cry for the community- this is also a great way to brief. Mares locally about what is happening around the issue of Veterans homelessness and so just wanted to bring that. Xin in your consideration. Thank you. Well thank you and thank you for all the as the work in your vision and leadership on this issue I really do think it's such a smart strategy it's really exciting to get an update on. The way that you're getting early traction here I think what we'll do is we'll and we'll hear from our other panelists and then add to questions with the group so- ms Lundy. Thank you for joining us again. Hi good morning thank you for having me again. I think back to the phenomenal job at highlighting the work that has been going in our community about some veteran- efforts and quickly housing veterans- I'll provide a little bit of the background context on. What led to all of this great momentum and work that is being done. At thirty in the summer in November and December of two thousand eighteen. Of the county started having conversations the nonprofit and volunteers of America and the VA locally. And to transition the veteran registry. And to the county for oversight. I'm we found that this was a in line with our- larger role as the leader of the pre made entry system and the lead- for the continuum of care. I'm just kind of being able to be a competing body for all the different veteran and nonprofit providers to focus. On veteran specifically. I'm step from there we have the January point intend cam at a loss to. I'm we can file the veteran registry and really have a good grasp of what that number look within our community- and- ever since then- when we released the point in time town. At there was the director from the board of supervisors to come up with a strategy to and veteran homelessness. And not let to marching home to and better homes Orange County. What we did is we can be in a body of Veterans stakeholders thing he leaders in our community- nonprofit service providers United Way veterans service providers and although that engage with veterans. And to come up with a strategy that over. That open a dress some of the barriers to helping. Them immediate actions that we could do to connect veterans to restart the- heart right and if I am and we also think goals and reducing. The length of time it takes for veterans to find healthy. At the- exact back share with you about being able to least up and thirty five days that's the main thing and even some. That we have. Greater success stories low we have health. Peak of better with the same day. At. Early work. I would be very strategic in chipping away at the number and making sure that. The structure that we built in help veterans and their homelessness. This is the level and will be able to be re created for new veterans that and her homelessness. Along with the marching home strategy and the veteran the board of supervisors also. Providing additional dollars to help with healthy navigation I am well there are some programs that provide housing like welcome home most seeing their still that component of navigating the veteran to the VA appointment to complete their application. To than help them with the viewing and all the steps in between that with the gap in our community after the board of supervisors under the contract for in and- Asian and the awful supporting some of those veterans that have zero income and to help them connect to the V. F. so office and make sure that they're able to- veteran benefits. And also finding creative ways to pay for rack has some veterans are able to manage to pay their portion of the rent or managed to pay their utility even when the half zero in half of the we wanted. To provide additional avenues for those veterans and not. Additional files or barriers to their housing. I have. The we continue to manage veteran registering and we're starting to do focused events. And to make sure that we connect the veterans in our veteran registry to vouchers. So yesterday an honor veterans day. We created a connection event where we are going to the veterans on a registry and bottom into the Housing Authority office. We have the VA we had on the hand housing authorities that man a housing authority. United Way with the welcome home and a couple other partners. So that people could connect to a one stop shop. Complete your have Mashable Haitian complete your intake your briefing packet for the hard facts about her with the helping authority. And then connect to one of the service providers to do some additional healthy navigation the support yeah or complete the application for a welcome home. And does really. Making sure that veterans are able to access the resources as easily as possible I'm- so from yesterday's event alone we had ten veterans of the voucher. These were ten veterans that had been on the registry the longest and high. Very complex situations. That need a lot of you know. Working three up I'm and then at the mention previously we have I'm five veterans that were house. I would say the strategy and plan to end veteran homelessness is really going to require all of our collective effort. In all of our collective Ashford. Is already making progress right would have 15% decrease and veteran homeless lessons we have that started to arrange herself to be a lot more intentional in our delivery of services and coordinating those services at. And we are very lucky to have a lot of the key partners at the table with- the housing authority the veterans service office. The health care agency with their- see for vets program that really target the needs of the veterans on the VA has been. Very helpful in making themselves available and events locally we don't have a hospitals a lot of that kind that the veterans have to travel to Long Beach. And to be able to get their services. But they are acceptable for us in a way that. Is really hurting reducing the barriers- and then we're offering very I'm happy to have a couple partners that are helping us with the employment component. I am of helping veterans it's reached first ability including good well- and Bonta America US. Bats were off the partner table. And I would also note. That. The Santa Ana veteran village in the placenta veterans village with George will speak about- in more detail are gonna be opening in twenty twenty and this will provide an additional hundred and twenty five units- it creates a community for these veterans to be able to succeed and be able to have the support that they need I'm it also creates an opportunity for those very for those that are that have been unable to search for her to look at helping. In the private market. And so it creates. An Avenue for them to be house I'm if they have been searching and they haven't been able to overcome those barriers. I would also note am. Now there's other I'm going progress and building additional affordable housing in permanent supportive housing through the Orange County finance trust with the goal of building those twenty seven hundred units. As we look at the resources that we have available and we do look at all the resources are available and by extension the scattered five model verses the- village model is something that will take into consideration to make sure that we match the back to the most appropriate resource. And when it's available or trying to support them in their transition. To whatever works for them past. We are very excited to continue our work in and then veteran homelessness we feel that we have the adequate resources- in terms of vast vouchers at this point we have more vouchers than veterans. But that's not to say that more veterans- cannot use them the VA has also been working with us aye reducing the criteria for how to bash words sometimes very stringent to mean. I'm chronic homelessness they have opened it to all homelessness. Level for that is a huge. Resource for our community to make sure that we are able to connect more people to the- after some not like them when you. Well I think one thing that's that's been really exciting for me to see just says. I'm here this is such a powerful partnership between. Our local government and the private sector in our non profits coming together to solve this issue so it's really- it's exciting. On with that of two here. Mister Circe from you thank you. Well to be here assembly woman Petrie-Norris and when thank you very much for the invitation and to. The joint oversight committee- I is George Sears in the chief operating officer jamboree. My responsibilities encompassed designing and delivering supportive services at all of our- affordable housing developments is a nonprofit organization. Our fundamental responsibility to ensure that our communities are sustainable and delivering best practice services across our entire portfolio- said and the better your which will be our first- homeless veterans project. And so we're very excited although it's not our first permits sport of housing projects so we're- applying the lessons we have learned and also I'll talk a little bit about how we're partnering with- veteran services. Organizations and in terms of designing our service delivery for almost that's an Orange County. Were very pleased to be here today- end I should mention in already six communities where we do our annual surveys of our residents. We know that we're serving between eight hundred and one thousand. Veterans in our affordable housing communities. As well already so I think that's a an invisible part of the veterans programs that people take advantage of. And I just to make a point about- what is needed to end homelessness in general which includes I would say veterans hopelessness is a subset of that. Although has a different- supportive services dimension to it. It is fundamentally built on the same principle that I we have a housing shortage crisis. And so. Housing. Action in the creation of new units is essential serve the entire problem. And to meet the challenge and so we are very grateful to be- really selected by the city of Santa Ana- help with funding from the county of orange- to- to deliver these units so. Santa Ana veterans village with the largest homeless veterans single purpose housing project in Orange County- mercy housing in Placentia has the Placentia veterans village under development. We will complete that project and began lease up in on February first of next year so we're we're coming right up on it and we're very excited about that opportunity. In addition in Orange County we have another one hundred and nine. Veteran housing units scattered throughout a variety of housing opportunities in Orange County so- that's a hundred and eighty four units of our own including the- the fifty from Placentia veterans allege and mercy housing- there's a good number of housing units coming on to target. What we have identified in the point in time can all echoed the flexibility that the VA is providing in terms of being flexible on the exact definition of homeless- that's that are able to be served by bash vouchers I think that's that's a central. Another. Invisible population that we see not being attended to and a growing challenge- which you may have heard of is the- errands who are homeless. And have a less than honorable discharge that challenge of serving that population in I think for the best that were here earlier the very eloquently documented the challenges of. That you face coming out of combat work service did you Asians- being that. Process out of military service with a less than honorable discharge and then not being able to be service can at all with the VA creates enormous challenges in terms of being able to use- high housing benefits. Are targeted at better it so I think that's an invisible population. We are aware of and we're struggling I think going to struggle to address in the future so hopefully that will become a priority. In terms of a senator veterans village. Which is only the first seventy five units of another hundred nine as I mentioned that we will be bringing online in the next two years- what we have learned is that what we don't know we can be taught by people who have experience so steep pack is of course one of the renowned experts in maybe in the country. On on housing homeless vets am providing supportive services and so where we learned a lot from Steve- one of his ex colleagues on our team the jamboree advising us on how we design these program. We're hiring bats with bringing and- the good will tear any center veterans legal institute strength and support which provides- veterans. Psychiatric services and psychological services. In two of our communities so it's senator better is village which I. Hope will get invitations to your and that you'll be able to attend the grand opening and in the spring. But one of the essential features that we realize is that these communities do become centers of service delivery to the veterans community in the surrounding neighborhood. So the state federal local governments are investing millions of dollars in the creation of these physical platforms. And what we know is that there are veterans need the same services that many of almost Besser seeking. Who live in these communities so what we did at Santana is we designed five thousand square feet a community services space we're good will Terni center. The L. Y. strength and support the VA case management team can all have an office. And a public service footprint there so that they face outward along First Street near harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana- there is the opportunity for people to come in and- who need to access services from these. Highly valuable organizations right there in the Santa Ana community as opposed to having to travel to another neighborhood another community. So there's a walk in opportunity that we find extremely valuable and also makes it possible for these great service for others to partner with us. By having a physical presence in these housing developments so it makes it a service rich environment not only for the residents who live there. But office also for the surrounding community so we're really pleased with our partnerships and- and hope to- replicate that in our. Next single purpose debtors housing development. I without I'll conclude my remarks and just say that- we're very proud to be an Orange County founded based organization that has a nonprofit corporation who seeks to develop additional housing for all sorts of vulnerable populations were honored to be able to begin to participate in this and our partnership with the county and the city of Santa Ana in particular is. We feel very grateful and honored and a great deal of responsibility to- to do the right thing by our debts who have come home deserve to be careful. Thank you. Thank you. To add as that is banks mentioned there are there when the challenges with the scattered site model is that there are that's where the ag cuties too great for that model to work are the services that are twenty provided that entrants villages. Going to be able to serve the needs of that population. Yes we're we're finding I appreciate. Deputy secretary boilers comments about the PhD program the demand- to insure you know using that one mechanism which we're not having to use mercy housing using a Placentia but the standard that was embedded in the policy language about having a high capacity services plan embedded within the development strategy and the application is essential so yes we have clinicians- we find about two hundred thousand dollars out of our operating budget to provide support services- with train staff. As well as the manage the collaborative that deliver all the services so we'd be a lot. We are both directly delivering. To the deaths through our own staff as well as collaborating with the VA and other organizations to serve the most high acuity debts that you can find on the streets- we're we're anticipating that we are taking of the people who are most challenging to serve in our work in what are the funding streams that were able to tap into. For the for the service side. Well what we did was we identified what we thought was a necessary standard based on at vice and experiences that both we've had an all of our advisors AT so we essentially bill the budget- before we went looking for- underwriting for the entire project. So we kept designing the underwriting strategy over and over again until we were able to find the operations of the property and we treated the services- funds as simply a part of the operating costs so what did that mean we had to do probably about another two to three million dollars worth of capital had to be acquired. So that they could we could under right. Not quite a quarter million dollars of funds for support of services every year right into the operating budget so that included- bonds that eight state bonds that included pro project based vouchers the bash vouchers from the city of Savannah- which with which we were able to secure additional data. So that we could find those services so it was usually using our traditional again we didn't go after the H. H. B. which would have been another option. But we were able to fund those supportive services using the traditional mechanisms that affordable housing projects across the state have used for years- it's just that we took us special care to. Outline the requirement for the funds up front. I just have one more question about- Epona hi to the full panel which is. So as you have been through this journey now are there opportunities where. I as as a local assembly member are the roadblocks nay. That we can help clear are you know ways that we can make it easier. To do the work you're doing an easier for us to get veterans the services that they need. Number. That is the fantastic question and thank you as always for your passion for- working to address at veterans homeless. I think looking at that kind of what I referenced earlier around rent increases- and as were being coming towards the end of those initial twelve month leases for people who can house. I think that is an area that we could look into further together. My initial thought and then- one of the areas that we're looking at as well as is the ongoing funding stream for support services. And so- as George mentioned they've been able to build it into their funding strategy for building I'm project based housing but for this guy right side and to be able to provide additional support services to what the VA can offer- the funding for that- were incredibly grateful for the funding that we receive. We know that there will be at a time frame for that will and- and so potentially in our help for ongoing funding streams. For their support services in the scattered site model. Thank you. I would say the opportunity to look at that veterans that towards managed the ones that are other than honorable just in making sure that there is some level of service to resources for them is outside the traditional model from the VA and we are seeing that being an increase in our community I'm and locally we're fortunate that we have to and- continuum of care dollars that targets a specific project for that community but I don't think it's going to be enough. I am at the population grows. I would also just add that- I think there are hidden pockets of. Senior veterans which I believe steep back addressing his comments- what we're finding of those. You know I'm roughly. With Chris last surveyed last year's side I'm saying eight hundred one thousand seniors. I'm sorry that is a good section of those are seniors and a good number of those are living a month to month- because of their inability to manage their own care and services and- finances and so we find ourselves at those properties I don't have any. Veterans services but print at all using our case management team to try to help those that's of find their soup long term sustainable housing options even though they may be living in. A unit that- they were eligible for fifteen years ago that was fifty or 60% average median income unit. We're seeing a growing population of senior veterans who are not sustainable in the current living situation. Well thank you all again for joining us today really appreciate your perspective on all of your work leadership on this issue. Armed with that will go ahead and this panel and I will open it up for public comment there's- anyone who would like to make a statement. Yes. I'm Jeff storeroom retired colonel in the United States Army and have face these issues. Going to tap. With a everyone else plus happen to deal with some other things related to transition out. The comments today and please correct me if I'm wrong but I. This is a systemic wide problem it seems like it's not only dealing with armed California issues- but also at the federal level. And also with the department of defense and the military. It seems to me the re the weekly today was our consultation or liaison with the department of defense not. A senior- but with our local you scraps in. All those liaisons and me. But if we don't are. My sense is it not commanders perhaps don't know about a lot of things that we have discussed today terms of all the problems are being. Despite our doubts when they get out. So I went out of the service com PTSD- and- I also out of the service in a state of. Shock being in the service for thirty years going back to the suit in world. And in just like wow what what is office. He now is very different culture of very different unity. About this is not only do we seems like would really doing some really cool things here once got that. And then transitional state in town. Someone before that seems to me like if we're not doing this we need to get together commanders. To tell about the state of affairs of what had. Happened into their military that's when they leave. And how is it that they can better assess there are military members water still in the service getting out. Not just tap program but maybe at the end of July but level. And I was thinking that- it may not in terms of our area maybe something might be it National Guard or reserves. Our local communities and perhaps a Los Alameda this might be a good place. To think about doing something like this I just thought about this today as we were talking I don't have a concept for you of operations about how to do it. But I think this is a weak blank. And just a- brief story when I was leaving. Bar tab. The dial the- often decided at the last minute. To pay. Me up bus. Are normally you're paid in the military or two weeks they decided we're not going to pay your mid March. So you're gonna have to get out and then you will get your- another month or so. Our I was livid. And so when I got when I got out I went home I wrote an email to fenced financial accounting agency. Yeah when this is what's going on- and I didn't quite to in this manner the weather in forty five minutes of surprise the call from the CEO bass wondering what. I'm in my Ste and so I told them what was going on and she said we will handle this. And then the five minutes I got a call from my own posts and they said we are going to take care of this problem and we are going. To give me math Hey to all these people who are get out. One is going to happen in the military is was senior ship there for our senior leadership gets upset enough and create. Climb in in a situation immediate action so what else that may be helpful to understand about the military. Miss Parker bureaucracy but when. Senior leaders decide to take action. I guess colonels or so. Thanks very quickly which means also they can make impediments. To rock things taking place like tap. Now in terms of out to help it's called on the rise strength of the unit and then science. And often times the size of this very well so people who must be going to tapped on Kobe as any to do other things with the unit. And so these math the things that management to be more aware of two. So anyway are. Very much well. Thank you for your service and thank you also for being part of our seventy fourth assembly district veterans Advisory Council. Good afternoon my name is Khan the city of Costa mesa. Mayor Foley are was- present that she had another and that she had to attend she asked me to make some notes on her behalf today. Firstly she's extremely grateful to these only members for holding this hearing here in the city of Costa mesa and for the special attention being paid to this concern. Since twenty four Costa mesa's network for homeless shins assisted one hundred and seventy two almost turns in the city. In April of this year the city almost assisted. Twelve turns and house two of them. So far Costa mesa Sir is being funded from existing source. All fund so additional funding for six the step up to for to provide these services directly great prove their ability to serve our state. Mayor Philip also wanted to share a little personal insight based on her brother's experience who recently medically retired twenty three years serving in the United States are. Merrilees call to action include first allow cities who are serving homeless and direct access to funds that having through an agency. Second close the gap for veterans receive a letter health insurance but you cannot have prescriptions filled if they're not the debate or the VA. For example her brother was recently visiting. Desperately needed his medication he was able to fulfill the prescription from the are at the or at the local yes because it would cost him six hundred dollars when he normally would have paid thirty dollars six. Thirty continue to inventory all appropriate state county and federal. Expedite the building a veteran work for housing because it is law legal and values that prevent us from hopping hopping affordable rates. Like the veterans who spoke today heard many stories of veterans in the community spending nearly fifty percent. Their income on renting a smaller more. That is unsustainable. Thank you again for your. You for bringing this hearing Sacramento in into the city of Khost the- mayor fully looks for working with our assembly representative. Between and each of you. Collaboratively in any way she can thank you again. To make a payment. Thank you again to all of our panelists for joining us today and for your leadership and focus on this issue I think my two big takeaways number one I think there's a lot as our incredible progress being made here in Orange County to address the crisis of veteran homelessness and to achieve the goal of any veteran homelessness in twenty twenty and I think my other. Major take away is that clearly a lot has to go wrong and there's gonna be a lot of cracks that someone slips through in order for veteran to wind up homeless and it does feel like so often we do not take action until it's a crisis and so I would love to. Be part of a continued recession on how can we do our job before it for people- speed through the cracks how can we invest more in prevention and more in early stage intervention. So with that thank you all for joining us and we are to
