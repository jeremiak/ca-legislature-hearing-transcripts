YEARS WHERE MANY MEMBERS OF THE

MEMBERS AND VETERANS AND

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.854
DISCRIMINATION AND USER TYPE

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.890
ACTIONS AND UNDERSTAND THE

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:40.491

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:41.459
FACE.

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:43.260
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.528
THIS CREATES A PREJUDICIAL

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.664
DISTINCTION BETWEEN VARIOUS

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:48.466

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:52.603
AND WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND LGBT

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.438

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:00.077
A BILL LIKE THIS IS NECESSARY

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.312
WHY WE NEED STATUTORY

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.713
AUTHORIZATION IS BECAUSE THERE

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.515
IS THIS PRESUMPTION NOT SUCH A

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:06.317
VETERANS PREFERENCE POLICY IS

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:07.652
DISCRIMINATORY.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.420
BECAUSE IT HAS AN ADVERSE IMPACT

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.589
ON WOMEN IN LGBT INDIVIDUALS.

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:14.191
SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:16.927

THEY HAD TO HIDE.

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.483

DISCHARGED FOR BEING GAY.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.526
IN THE MILITARY THAT THEY WOULD

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:26.464
STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:26.764
[inaudible]

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:29.500

I AM SOMEWHAT EXPERT IS AREA THE

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.639
IN A VETERAN.

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:38.509
THIS BILL WAS AMENDED TWO YEARS

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:43.380
AGO -- TO GIVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:46.484
TO THE WHOLE LGBT Q. COMMUNITY.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.619
THE WAY THE MILITARY WORKS IS IN

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:49.687
ORDER TO GET A DISHONORABLE

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.455

OKAY AND CONVICTED.

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.761

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:57.361
MILITARY.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:40:01.699
SO. 99% OF GAYS AND I DON'T KNOW

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:04.201

DISCHARGE LIKE ANY OTHER VETERAN.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:14.612
COMMITTED CRIMINAL ACTS EXCEPT.

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:17.348
NOW THIS BILL AND IT'S A LITTLE

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:19.817
TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT MILITARY

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:20.117

I INCLUDED.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.455
ANYONE THAT WAS DISCHARGE UNDER

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.624
HONORABLE CONDITIONS A GENERAL

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:29.527
DISCHARGE NO A GENERAL DISCHARGE

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:31.362
WAS USED BY THE MILITARY FOR

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:35.065
MANY YEARS THE BASICALLY GET RID

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:36.600
OF DON'T ASK DON'T TELL PEOPLE.

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.502
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:42.506
RESTORES EQUALITY AND HONOR. TO

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:44.375
THOSE VETERANS AND THEY WILL

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.210
HAVE THE SAME PREFERENCES ANYONE

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:52.082

POINTED OUT.

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:04.328
THAT THIS BILL CORRECTS -- SO --

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.830
THE OPPOSITION.

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:08.299
I'M ALWAYS CONFUSED I DON'T

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:10.935
THINK THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:13.437
POSITIVE IMPACT OF THIS BILL.

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:16.040

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.908
FOR TRANS GENDER FROM THE

MILITARY EVERY YEAR.

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.598
SO IT'S NOT A LARGE POPULATION

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:41.198
HAS A SMALL POPULATION

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:41.498

EDUCATION MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.482

SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:51.701

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.034
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.468
ADDITIONALLY THE STATUTORY

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.270
MANDATE WITH REGARD TO PAY AND

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:37.105
THEN THAT THE LIST OF ENTITIES

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.640
THAT COULD PROVIDE THIS TRAINING

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.142
CONTROL THE MARKET PLACE.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:41.176
AND SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.245
THEY WOULD ADD ONS UNNECESSARILY

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.613
DRIVE UP THE COST FOR THIS TYPE

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.315
OF TRAINING AND CONTROL WHO CAN

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:47.649
PROVIDE THE TRAINING CURRENTLY

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:48.784
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE AS

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:56.892
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRAIN

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.058
AND I THINK THE COURAGE HAS BEEN

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.761
DEMONSTRATED -- UP BY THE THE

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:07.062

THROUGHOUT THIS NATION.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.534
AND RAISING ATTENTION BEFORE IT

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:14.636
WAS COOL BEFORE IT WAS HOLLYWOOD

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:17.039
BEFORE IT WAS POPULAR -- BUT I I

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:21.843

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.288
BEEN HARASSED FOR RAISING

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:34.856

ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.666
IT DOES -- IT DOES HAVE AN AYE

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.168
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.336

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.804
THAT WE CAN GET THIS TO THE

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.238
GOVERNOR'S THAT ARE NEW

GOVERNOR'S DESK AND AND FINALLY

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:53.508

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.377
SENSE TO HAVE THOSE DOING THE

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.112
TRAINING THAT UNDERSTAND.

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:58.947
HOW TO TRAIN THOSE THAT ARE PUT

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.916
IN SITUATIONS THAT CAN BE VERY

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:02.517
DANGEROUS I THINK IT MAY IT WILL

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.319
MAKE FOR A SAFER AND HAPPIER

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.921
WORKPLACE WHICH I THINK WILL

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:06.488
MAKE FOR A?

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.789
BETTER EMPLOYEES FOR THE

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.725

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:12.427
REALLY IS A WIN WIN SITUATION

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.529
AND WITH THAT.

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:15.230
SOME OF HIS OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.698
CLOSE I WOULD AND JUST IN IN

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.333
TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMS

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.134
FROM THE COMMENTS YOU DON'T

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.569
TRULY UNDERSTAND THE IMPETUS

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.770
BEHIND THIS BILL.

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.171
AND THAT THE TRAINERS THEMSELVES

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.507
HAVE TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:29.344
WORKPLACE THE CULTURE -- THE THE

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.813
EVEN COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.516
FOLKS WHO -- THEY'RE TALKING TO

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.685
IT IS VERY EASY FROM A LEGAL

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:37.786
STANDPOINT I GUESS FROM A

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.354
QUALIFIED TRAINER TO COME IN AND

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.690
SAY DON'T LET SOMEBODY TO THIS

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.057
TO YOU.

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.392
THAT'S AN EASY THING WE'VE ALL

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.459
BEEN THROUGH SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:46.395
TRAINING AND WE'VE SCOFFED AT

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.062
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE TOLD

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:47.896
TO US.

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.231
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.566
LARGELY A FEMALE POPULATION WHO

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.468
IS WORKING BY THEMSELVES AT

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:56.405

AND DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.240
WHAT -- IS APPROPRIATE IS NOT

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.842
APPROPRIATE IN FROM THE ROLE OF

THE JANITOR TO BE ABLE TO ASK

IN THIS CRITICAL SAFETY NET

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:46.808
STOPPING WORKING FAMILIES IN A

POSITION WHERE THEY MUST CHOOSE

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.677
BETWEEN SACRIFICING THEIR PAY IN

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.212
COMING TO WORK SICK.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.780
IN ANTICIPATION OF A THE

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.081
OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS I WILL

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.550
REMIND FOLKS OF FIVE YEARS AGO

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.784
THEY WARNED US THAT THIS WOULD

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:57.985
BE A JOB KILLER THE JOBS WOULD

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.420
OF COURSE FLEE FROM CALIFORNIA

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:00.288
AS A RESULT.

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:01.656
OF PROVIDING JUST THREE PAID

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:02.890
SICK DAYS AND I'M SURE WE WILL

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.992
HEAR THAT AGAIN TODAY PERHAPS

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.727
NOT WITH A JOB KILLER TITLE BUT

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:07.662
THE SAME THING.

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.597
I WOULD VENTURE TO ASK THEM HOW

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.732
MANY JOBS AND IMPACT -- HAVE

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.401
HAVE BEEN LOST IN CALIFORNIA AS

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:15.136
A RESULT OF PROVIDING PAID SICK

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:17.905
DAYS IN FACT WE KNOW THAT --

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.707
THERE THERE HASN'T BEEN AT TO

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:20.775
OUR KNOWLEDGE RECORDED LOSS OF A

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.077
JOB AS A RESULT OF LIEU OF

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.779
PROVIDING PAID SICK DAYS AND IN

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.714
FACT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:32.920
ALONG IN PROVIDED EVEN MORE.

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:33.988
WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY.

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:34.589
FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES IF YOU

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.089
WELL WHO DON'T RECOGNIZE

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.190
INDIVIDUALS NEED TO TAKE TIME

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:37.525
OFF WHEN THEY'RE SICK -- AND AS

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:38.326
WE MOVE FORWARD THIS IS

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.961
SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD BE A

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:42.730
STANDARD -- FOR THE ENTIRE STATE

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:43.631
THAT MAKES SENSE I WANT TO

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.132
REMIND PEOPLE THAT IF YOU LIVE

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.535
IN WORK IN A CITY LIKE SAN DIEGO

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.337
YOU COULD LITERALLY -- WORK AT

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:51.806
THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT PART TIME

01:31:51.873 --> 01:31:54.242
ACROSS CITY LINES HAVE A

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.077
DIFFERENTIATION OF ANYWHERE

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:58.145
BETWEEN -- TWO AND SEVEN DAYS OF

01:31:58.212 --> 01:32:00.014
OF SICK TIME SO THIS IT DOESN'T

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:01.549
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE -- YOU COULD

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.050
BE WORKING FOR THE SAME COMPANY

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:04.352
AND HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:06.287
BENEFITS AND IT'S TIME TO

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.588
STANDARDIZE THOSE AND PUSH THEM

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:10.091
UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE I

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:10.491

THE PAID SICK DAYS IS REALLY A

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.349

ALTHOUGH THE US IS QUITE ALONE

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:07.915

MOST PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:51.605
PART OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.274
REQUESTING IS THAT IT BE ACROSS

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.742
THE BOARD PREEMPTION -- I DO

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:55.843
UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.111
OF ALLOWING ADDITIONAL DAYS OF

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:59.313
SICK LEAVE HOWEVER FOR EMPLOYERS --

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.548
OVER THERE ALREADY TRYING TO

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:01.549
STRUGGLE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:03.784
LOCAL ORDINANCES DIFFERENT WAGE

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.019
RATES FOR DIFFERENT ORDINANCES

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:06.320
AND ACROSS THE BOARD PREEMPTION

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:07.321
IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WOULD

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:09.256
ESPECIALLY HELP -- EMPLOYERS IN

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.225
THE SITUATION ADDITIONALLY WE

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:14.094
ARE ASKING THAT -- THE RATE OF

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:15.596
PAY BE BASED ON THE BASE RATE

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:16.964
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IS

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.632
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ANECDOTAL

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:20.568
EVIDENCE WITH REGARD TO A

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:22.102
EMPLOYEES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PAID

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:22.670
SICK LEAVE.

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:24.405
ON HOLIDAYS SO WHEN THEY'RE

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:26.273
GETTING THEIR HIGHER RATE OF PAY

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.242
AND ADDITIONALLY AT THE WHEN

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:29.843
THEY'RE AT THE END OF HARVEST

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.811
AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.112
ARE AT A HIGHER RATE OF PAY

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:33.214
BECAUSE THEY ALL CALL IN SICK AT

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.181
THE SAME TIME.

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:35.182
BECAUSE THEY'LL MAKE MORE MONEY

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.417
ON THOSE DAYS THAN IF THEY

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:37.785
CALLED IN SICK HONORED ON A

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:39.186
REGULAR WORK DAY ADDITIONALLY

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:40.254

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:42.122
IMPLEMENTATION IN THE BILL FOR

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.224
I. H. S. S. WORKERS.

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:44.825
ARE OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE FEEL

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:45.326
THAT IF THERE'S DELAYED

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.827
IMPLEMENTATION FOR ONE INDUSTRY

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:48.095
AGAIN IT SHOULD BE APPLICABLE

01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:49.063
ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:51.265
AND LASTLY -- VERIFICATION AGAIN

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:53.000
THIS IS TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.902

REALLY THAT SICK -- SHOULD WE AT

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:45.332
LEAST.

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:46.600
GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE.

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.235
SO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:50.137
DISPUTE ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.605
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS MOST

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:52.840
PEOPLE DON'T USE FIVE

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:54.074
CONSECUTIVE DAYS I MEAN THERE

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.210
MIGHT BE A THEY THEY TEND TO USE

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.812
A DAY -- AND SO IF IT WAS ON THE

FIFTH DAY I GUESS IF YOU'RE SICK

01:42:01.715 --> 01:42:02.249
FOR A DAY THEN IT'S THE FIFTH

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:02.983
DAY.

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.685
SECOND WITH THAT IS THE REALITY

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.854
THAT -- A LOT OF WORKERS DON'T

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.323
HAVE ACCESS TO A DOCTOR.

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:11.792
AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.494
TRUTH AND WE STILL SUFFER FROM

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.296
THAT IN THIS STATE AND SO -- OR

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:18.031
THE COST OF OF GOING TO THE

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:19.466
DOCTORS SO HIGH ESPECIALLY FOR

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:22.402
LOW WAGE WORKERS -- WHO DON'T

01:42:22.469 --> 01:42:23.337
HAVE THAT ACCESS?

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.038
WE STILL HAVE IN THIS IN THIS

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:26.974
STATE UNINSURABLE FOLKS AND SO

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.642
WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO ADD AN

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:30.777
ADDITIONAL COST ON TO SOMETHING

01:42:30.844 --> 01:42:32.846
THAT LET'S BE HONEST IT'S EARNED

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:35.048
SICK TIME IT'S NOT GIVEN TO AN

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.817
EMPLOYEE IT'S EARNED THROUGHOUT

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:39.853
THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE -- AND SO

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.089
YOU KNOW IT IN AND RECOGNIZING

01:42:42.155 --> 01:42:44.558
ALL OF THAT -- WE DON'T FEEL

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:47.828
THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE -- TO TO

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:49.897
BE ASKING WORKERS WHO CAN BE ALL

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:51.298
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS FOR YOUR

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:52.266
EYE ON THE FIFTH DAY IT'S

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:54.034
PROBABLY EVER BEFORE OUT FIVE

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:54.868
DAYS WOULD PROBABLY.

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.436
SPEND THE FIFTY DOLLAR COPAY TO

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.405
GO TO THE DOCTOR AND AND WE

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.474
COULD GET AN OUT -- BUT WE'RE IN

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:02.009
A MUCH BETTER SITUATION AND AND

01:43:02.075 --> 01:43:03.443
AND THE TRUTH IS WE WOULD NEVER

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.545
BE EXPECTED.

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:05.712
TO THERE'S ALSO SOME PRIVACY

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.681
CONCERNS WITH THAT -- IN IN THE

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:11.018
FACT THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY --

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:14.221
WANT TO FORCE WORKERS TO TELL

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:15.789
THEIR EMPLOYER WHAT EXACT

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.491
SICKNESS THEY HAVE OR WHAT

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:18.859
DOCTOR THEIR SCENE.

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.060
I'M AND FINALLY I'D SAY THE

01:43:20.127 --> 01:43:21.328
IMPETUS FOR ME WRITING THIS BILL

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:22.563
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S KIND OF

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:24.064
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE TALK A

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:24.898
LOT ABOUT SICK DAYS NOW IN THE

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:27.234
FLU -- REALLY IN THAT OUR OUR

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:28.902
WORKERS THAT WE HAD HERE BEFORE

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:31.371
WERE THE REASON I I A BROKE THE

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:34.374
SPELL WHEN I WAS A UNION LEADER

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.877
AND ORGANIZER -- TALKING TO TWO

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:38.545
NEW WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:40.180
UNIONIZE WOULD ASK THEM LIKE HOW

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:41.648
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE GREATEST

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:42.749
THING ABOUT HAVING A UNION AND

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:44.051
YOU THINK IT BE LIKE THEY'RE

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.419
GETTING A PAY INCREASE OR

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:46.587
THEY'RETHEY'RE GETTING --

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:48.789
HEALTH CARE WAGES AND TIME AND

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.424
TIME AGAIN WE HEAR STORIES

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.192
ESPECIALLY FROM SINGLE MOMS LIKE.

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:54.261
IF MY SON'S SCHOOL CALLS IN HE

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:58.465
SAID I CAN GO PICK HIM UP AND

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.800
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE MY JOB.

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:00.801
YOU KNOW I A IF I'M STATE I CAN

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.102
STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS WHEN

01:44:02.169 --> 01:44:02.436
THEY'RE SICK.

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:03.070
SO THE IMPETUS ME WRITING THIS

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:04.638
BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD TO

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:05.505
DO.

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:08.375
MUCH MORE SO -- YOU KNOW I I'D

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:08.976
NEVER TAKEN A SICK DAY IN MY

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:09.710
LIFE.

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.645
BUT I HAD TAKEN OFF WORK TO GO

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:15.015
GET MY KIDS BECAUSE I WAS.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:15.682
AND JULIE SENDING THEM TO SCHOOL

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.818
WITH A FEVER -- AND YOU GET

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:19.419
CAUGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT CAN'T

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:21.088
WORKING PARENTS TEND TO DO -- OR

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:22.422
THEY THROW UP AT SCHOOL YOU HAVE

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.524
TO GET THEM RIGHT AND SO IT'S

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.960
NOT A SITUATION BY WHICH YOU

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.862
COULD HAVE MULTIPLE KIDS AND AND

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.631
THEY COULD HAVE A COMMON COLD.

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:33.300
AND SO ONE KID SEC ONE DAY TWO

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:34.701
DAYS THREE DAYS AND THEN THE

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.303
NEXT KID GET SECOND YOUR HOME

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:37.938
FIVE DAYS AND YOU'VE NEVER GONE

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:38.505
TO THE DOCTOR AND IT'S NOT

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:39.539
UNREASONABLE.

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:41.008
AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THOSE

01:44:41.074 --> 01:44:41.441
ALL THOS EXTENUATING

01:44:41.508 --> 01:44:43.343
CIRCUMSTANCES I FIND IT

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:45.278
UNFORTUNATE -- THAT WE DON'T

01:44:45.345 --> 01:44:47.981
TRUST OUR OWN WORK FORCE TO TELL

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.082
US THE TRUTH.

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.217
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.284
THE MOST DISTURBING THINGS ABOUT

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:52.786
THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:54.554
IS THAT WE DON'T PUT THAT TRUST

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:55.389
IN OUR WORKERS THESE ARE PEOPLE

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:56.456
WHO MAKE.

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.291
OUR OUR WHATEVER WORK WE DO IF

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:00.160
IT AS BOSSES IF YOU WILL -- WERE

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.862
SUPERVISORS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

01:45:01.928 --> 01:45:04.264
ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE WORK

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:04.998
TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL AND

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.134
PROFITABLE AND YET WE DON'T.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.469
TRUST IF THEY SAY THEY'RE SICK

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.304
OR THEIR LOVED ONE TO STICK OR

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:12.539
THEY NEED TO STAY HOME --

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:15.542
THERE'S ALSO A A AN OPPORTUNITY

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.210
FOR FOR ON MENTAL HEALTH REASONS

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.079
TO STAY HOME THAT'S ALSO YOU CAN

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.747
BE SICK ON STRESS.

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:21.882
AND SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:23.617
ASPECTS TO IT TO WHITE PEOPLE

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.686
NEED SOMETIMES A DAY OFF OR TWO

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:27.387
DAYS OFF AND WE THINK UP TO FIVE

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.456
DAYS OFF IS REASONABLE -- THAT

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.024
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:32.993
HAVE THEM EXPLAIN THAT WE ARE

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.728
PRESENT AB PANTENE THE SAN DIEGO

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:39.332
ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES A FOURTH

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.034
AND FIFTH DAY TO HAVE.

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:42.235
A NO WE TRIED VERY HARD TO WORK

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:44.137
WITH OUR WITH COMPANIES -- THAT

01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:44.604
THAT OPERATE MULTIPLE

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.039
JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE ONE SET OF

IS I MEAN IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.716
WORKER IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE

THAT THAT READ DIFFERENTLY --

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:00.320

SICK DAYS IS GOOD NOT JUST FOR

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.939
THE WORKERS BEFORE THE EMPLOYERS.

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:21.074
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT YOUR

AS A STATE IN THE RIGHT

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.721
DIRECTION EVEN THOUGH I THINK

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:36.323
THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO TO

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:38.125
PROTECT WORKERS AND WITH THAT --

01:46:38.191 --> 01:46:39.659
WE DO HAVE A MOTION I WAS AT

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.228
CLOSING COMMENTS JUST A COUPLE

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:42.529
OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.131
A PORN ASKED ABOUT -- HOLIDAY

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:46.233
PAY I I THINK MOST OF US NOW

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.334
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT BILL

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.202
MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAD DEFEATED --

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.237
THAT HOLIDAY BEHAVE IN

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:52.773
CALIFORNIA IS NOT A RIGHT AND IN

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:54.674
FACT MOST PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:55.776
BENEFIT FROM HOLIDAY PAY OUR

01:46:55.842 --> 01:46:57.577
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO I WOULD LOVE

01:46:57.644 --> 01:46:58.545
TO TALK TO THE BUSINESSES THAT

01:46:58.612 --> 01:46:59.613
SUGGESTS THAT THEIR NUMBER OF

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:00.914
PEOPLE TAKING HOLIDAYS OFF

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.550
BECAUSE THEY GET PAID MORE -- IN

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:04.651
THOSE SITUATIONS I WOULD SUGGEST.

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:05.752
I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.754
RETAILERS THE PAY ON TIME AND A

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:08.822
HALF OR GIVE AN EXTRA TURKEY ON

THANKSGIVING -- AND THAT PERHAPS

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:12.926
THEY CAN NOT SCHEDULE THEIR

01:47:12.993 --> 01:47:14.461
WORKERS ON THANKSGIVING AND THAT

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:15.796
WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND THE

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:17.964
OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HEARD IS

01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:18.632

I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:05.409
EXPERIENCE IN MISSION BEACH CAFE

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:09.379

EMPLOYMENT I WAS OFTEN PAID LATE

02:38:13.083 --> 02:38:14.618
AND WHEN I WAS PAID MY CHECKS

02:38:14.685 --> 02:38:16.453
WOULD OFTEN BOUNCE I NEVER KNEW

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:17.688
THE NEXT TIME I WAS GETTING PAID

02:38:17.754 --> 02:38:18.689
OR WHEN THERE WOULD BE.

02:38:18.755 --> 02:38:20.858
SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:21.859
FOR ME TO COLLECT.

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:23.627
I OFTEN HAD TO DIP INTO MY

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.362
SAVINGS TO PAY FOR RENT AND

02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:27.598
OTHER BILLS I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH

02:38:27.664 --> 02:38:29.600
TO HAVE A SAVINGS TO RELY ON

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:30.701
WHERE SOME OF MY OTHER COWORKERS

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:30.901
WERE.

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:33.537
NOT AS LUCKY -- I'M PARTICULAR

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:34.504
ONE OF MY COWORKERS WAS

02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:36.440
THREATENED WITH EVICTION BECAUSE

02:38:36.506 --> 02:38:37.741
OF THE EMPLOYER NOT PAYING HIM

02:38:37.808 --> 02:38:38.642
ON TIME.

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:40.110
AND ANOTHER ONE OF MY CO WORKERS

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:42.112
STRESSED BECAUSE HE CAN A FEW

02:38:42.179 --> 02:38:43.714
THIS FAMILY BECAUSE HE HAD

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:44.248
RECEIVED A PAYCHECK YET.

02:38:44.314 --> 02:38:45.482
I'M ON TOP OF IT BEING VERY

02:38:45.549 --> 02:38:47.684
STRESSFUL IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT

02:38:47.751 --> 02:38:49.753
BECAUSE OF BEING PAID LATE --

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:51.021
EMPLOYEES OFTEN THINK YOU'RE

02:38:51.088 --> 02:38:53.357
LATE FEES FOR MISSED PAYMENTS

02:38:53.423 --> 02:38:54.224
AND HOW TO PAY A HIGHER INTEREST

02:38:54.291 --> 02:38:56.727
RATES ON BILLS AND LOANS -- THIS

02:38:56.793 --> 02:38:58.428
BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:38:58.495 --> 02:38:59.963
THERE'S NO EASY WAY FOR AN

02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:01.531
EMPLOYER TO FORCE YOUR PLAYER TO

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:03.333
PAY ON TIME -- IN MY OPINION

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:04.201
THIS BILL SHOULD DEFINITELY

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:06.270
ALREADY EXIST WE'VE BEEN IN TWO

02:39:06.336 --> 02:39:08.205

02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:10.073

IS DANIELLE URBAN AND THE

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:23.520
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER

02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:24.187
FOR WORKERS RIGHTS I SACRAMENTO

02:39:24.254 --> 02:39:25.255

ORGANIZATION.

02:39:26.456 --> 02:39:28.058
SERVING LOW WAGE WORKERS.

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:31.028
WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORED AB SIX

02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:31.561
SEVEN THREE BECAUSE UNDER

02:39:31.628 --> 02:39:33.263
CURRENT LAW THERE'S NO PRACTICAL

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:34.965
REMEDY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT

02:39:35.032 --> 02:39:35.966

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:37.200
AS YOU HAVE JUST HEARD THIS CAN

02:39:37.267 --> 02:39:39.369
CAUSE EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:40.871
FOR THE MANY EMPLOYEES WHO LIVE

THEY CAN PAY FOR FOOD RENT AND

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:47.911
OTHER DAILY NECESSITIES.

02:39:47.978 --> 02:39:49.579
THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT LAW

02:39:49.646 --> 02:39:50.914
IS THAT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PAID

02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:53.083
THEY HAVE NO CLEAR OR EFFECTIVE

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:55.185
RECOURSE THE CURRENT LABOR CODE

02:40:00.958 --> 02:40:01.892
NAME.

02:40:01.959 --> 02:40:03.160
EVEN IF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:04.895
WAS EXERCISING THIS AUTHORITY

02:40:04.962 --> 02:40:06.897
WHICH THEY ARE NOT.

02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:08.732
THEY THE WERE UP PENALTIES WOULD

02:40:08.799 --> 02:40:10.667
BE PAID TO THE STATE AND NOT TO

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.235
THE WORKER.

02:40:12.302 --> 02:40:14.838
THESE EFFORTS TO RECOVER -- FOR

02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:17.007
LATE PAYCHECKS ARE NOT REALISTIC

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:18.108
FOR EMPLOYEES WHO SIMPLY WANT TO

02:40:18.175 --> 02:40:19.509
BE PAID ON TIME AND BE

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:21.244
COMPENSATED FOR THE LOSSES

02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:22.846
CAUSED BY THE LATE PAYMENTS.

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:24.414

TWO TEN SO THAT CAN BE A

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:28.919
PRACTICAL TOOL FOR WORKERS TO

02:40:28.986 --> 02:40:31.321
RECOVER WAGES THAT ARE OVERDUE.

02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:32.556
FIRST THE PENALTY ALREADY

02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:35.292
PROVIDED IN LABOR CODE SECTION

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:37.160
TWO TEN WILL GO TO THE AGGRIEVED

HUNDRED DOLLAR PENALTY.

02:40:44.568 --> 02:40:46.036
ON SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS OR FOR

02:40:46.103 --> 02:40:47.537
A WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:48.872
VIOLATION.

02:40:48.939 --> 02:40:50.707
THE PENALTY WOULD INCREASE TO

TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PLUS THE 25%

02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:54.845
OF THE AMOUNT UNLAWFULLY WITHOUT.

02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:56.279
SECOND THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE

AMENDMENTS HOWEVER THEY

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:39.249
ESSENTIALLY CREATE THE SAME

02:42:39.316 --> 02:42:41.017

PRETTY BORING FOR MANY BUT I AM

02:42:54.731 --> 02:42:55.832
THE REASON BEING THAT THE

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:57.100
LANGUAGE CHANGES THE PENALTY

02:42:57.167 --> 02:42:58.635
FROM A CIVIL PENALTY TO A

02:42:58.702 --> 02:42:59.636
STATUTORY PENALTY.

02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:01.171
A STATUTORY PENALTY HAS TO GO TO

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:02.873
THE EMPLOYEE IN THIS SITUATION

02:43:02.939 --> 02:43:04.174
WE ARE OKAY WITH THE PENALTY

02:43:04.241 --> 02:43:05.675
GOING TO THE EMPLOYEE WHAT WE'RE

02:43:05.742 --> 02:43:07.110
NOT OKAY WITH HIS EMPLOYER BEING

PENALIZED TWICE.

02:43:08.278 --> 02:43:09.913
SO NOW IF THIS INDIVIDUAL BRINGS

A CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE

02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:12.449
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT THAT'S

02:43:12.516 --> 02:43:13.750
WHERE CREATE THIS IS BACKING A

02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:15.318
PENALTIES BECAUSE THEY CAN COVER

02:43:15.385 --> 02:43:16.720

ALLOWED TO RECOVERTHE CIVIL

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:24.661
PENALTY UNDER THE POCK ACTION SO

02:43:24.728 --> 02:43:26.062
