DON AND BE HERE WITH OUR OUR BOARD PRESIDENT TO PRESS. ON IN LARGE QUANTITIES STAFF. SOME ARE ON BOARD MEMBERS. AND OUR CLIENTS -- I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH MY WHOLE PRESENTATION MORNING IN THE INTEREST OF TIME -- BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO MAKE A FEW POINTS TODAY THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT IN THE MAIL GEN POINTS YOU'VE HEARD AND PLACES IN THE STATE SOME. OTHER FOLKS ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ON THE REALLY GOOD THINGS. HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. YOUR CHALLENGE -- AND WHAT IS IN THE AREA OF RISK COORDINATION. PROBABLY NO YOUR RECORD. IN THIS SURVEY. ON ARE JUST. IN. THIS EXCERPT OF TO PROVIDE RESPONSES. THIS IS A SUSTAINABLE. REDWOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO FUNDED. MANDATED. RATE GOES. UP. WE DON'T. REAL MONSTERS SERVICE NATION. FUNDED FOR ABOUT 65%. OF THE COST [INAUDIBLE] AN ENTERTAINING. PART OF THE PROBLEM [INAUDIBLE] FORMULA [INAUDIBLE] UNDER. FOUR IF YOU HAVE [INAUDIBLE] THE WORKING. ANOTHER WHICH IF YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE SERVING IN YOUR REGIONAL CENTER YOU GET SO MANY SERVICE COORDINATORS. WITH THAT AND CAPTURE THE REALITY OF PROVIDING SERVICES IN OUR FOR RURAL COUNTIES. AND LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IF A FAMILY WANTS TO BRING THEIR CHILD. TO A SPECIALIZED META SERVICE SAY SOMETHING LIKE NOR A TREE. WELL. WE DON'T HAVE THAT. SO WE HAVE TO ARRANGE TO TRANSPORT ON THAT FAMILY. ON TO SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO. SO WE HAVE. TO TRAVEL WE HAVE TO ARRANGE. FOR HOTEL ACCOMMODATE. WE MAY HAVE TO ARRANGE. THE PANEL FUELS [INAUDIBLE] YEAH [INAUDIBLE] A GROUP [INAUDIBLE] YEAH BUT YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. IF WE WILL. DO THE TEST [INAUDIBLE] IT'S TRUE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO -- AS LONG AS WE USE THIS. IS A PER CAPITA FUNDING FOR ANA WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SERVICE COORDINATORS TO BE A TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN. OUR WORLD FOR THESE -- YOU TRAVELED UP HERE -- IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE -- BUT IT TAKES TIME TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING WAS THE NEEDS OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER COMMUNITY -- BECAUSE OF SOME -- AND WE'RE WORKING MALTA NO WHICH WORKS REALLY WELL OUR SERVICE. APPLE BUT I'LL GIVE YOU. AN ASTUTE DURING THE REDWOOD THANKS FOR THIS. LONG DAYS SEVEN DAYS WE WITH OUR TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. I NEEDED. TO OKAY. LOCATED TO ANOTHER AREA WAITING [INAUDIBLE] THAT. TO DO WELL THEY WERE REAL. TRY TO KEEP THE LEVEL OF MOTHER. AND THEN THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AS YOU KNOW FOR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE JUST NOT COMPETITIVE. ON THEY'RE NOT COMPETITIVE WITH FAST FOOD THEY'RE NOT COMPETITIVE WAS WAS RETAIL. AND THE SKILL SET THAT OUR PROVIDERS -- IS IS LARGE ON THEY'RE DOING IMPORTANT WORK. ON SOMETIMES A DEALING WITH PEOPLE WAS VERY COMPLEX NEEDS. ON THE LEVEL OF TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED IS HIGH AND WE AND WE WANT TO BE HIGHER -- SO -- WE NEED. TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE RATES AND WE NEED TO DO IT SOON. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE RATES THAT WERE ABLE TO PAY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OUR AREA -- AND WE NEED WE NEED MORE SERVICES TO BE A WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE FOLKS THAT WE SERVE [INAUDIBLE] FOR THE IN THE LAST POINT DR PHONE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN UNKNOWN THEN I'LL SHUT UP. ON IS. THE I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE. MUCH MORE -- BUT ENTER ENTER. TOM WE LEARN FROM OUR RICHER THAN ON A DRUG. THAT IF JENNER HI [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT. NO. TO THOSE THAT WE KNOW. RATES OF DUAL DIAGNOSED THIS. THE I. D. D. POPULATION. SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE KIDS EARLY WE KNOW THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO AND IF WE IF WE CAN INVEST IN THIS EARLY INTERVENTION WE CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES. WE CAN KEEP FAMILY STRONG WE CAN KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. ON END. THE BOTTOM LINE -- IN TERMS OF OUR TAX DOLLARS IN OUR RESOURCES IS THAT THIS EARLY INTERVENTION IS. MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN WAITING TO LATER ON WHEN WE HAVE. TO DEVELOP -- LOCKED FACILITIES ON ME AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE EXPENSIVE AND AND HARMFUL FRANKLY TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. SOON THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY ON THAT. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO US DEPRESS OUR PORT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A LISTENING TO US IT'S DEEPLY DEEPLY APPRECIATED. THE PRESENCE OF SENATE WHICH HAS BROUGHT TAKES ME BACK TO THE NUMBER OF YEARS TWENTY YEARS AGO. MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS BORN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. IT WAS. AS A RESULT OF THAT EVENT THAT I BECAME INVOLVED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER BECAME PRESIDENT DONALD [INAUDIBLE] INCLUDED. I'M OFF BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT NEW IDEAS IN. A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. FROM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY NEEDED COME FORWARD. AND BEGIN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE REINS AND GUIDE AND DIRECT ACCORDING TO THE VALUES OF EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH IS THE QUORUM. REGIONAL CENTER WARTS. I I RETURNED ON THE BASIS TO SERVE AGAIN. AND I WAS STRUCK BY. THE REPEAT OF INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY. AND I SAY THIS AND I WANT EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THIS. MEMBERS SENATOR WEST HAS BRO AN ASSEMBLY PERSON PATTY BURKE. OUR SYSTEM WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY BACK IN THOSE YEARS WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH A HUGE BUDGET CUTS. WAY BACK THEN TO THAT. BUSINESS MANAGER PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON AND WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE 10% REDUCTION PLANS THAT BECAME REALITIES. WITHIN TWO OR THREE MONTHS AFTER SUBMITTING THEM SO I UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITHIN THE STATE AND AT THE SAME TIME HOW THAT WAS OF THE? OUR ABILITY TO SERVE. CONSUMERS CLIENTS BACK IN THOSE DAYS AND AGAIN AFTER. THIS TIME OFF. WE FIND OURSELVES. BACK IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE OF TRYING TO CATCH UP. IN AN APPRECIATE THAT. WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THOUGH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF I THINK FUTURE PLANNING? THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE COLLABORATION. VERY UNIQUE I'M NOT SURE THAT. THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN THE CLIENTS AND CONSUMERS THAT ARE SERVED. BY THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND THE INVESTMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE STATE LEGISLATURES MAKING. ITS UNIQUE MY CONCERN WHEN I SEE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ARE WE GOING TO FACE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US HERE TO THINK ABOUT. THAT SYSTEM IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE I WOULD DARE SAY EVEN TO INVEST. IN FUTURE US. TO STUDY. THE BEST MINDS IN A POSSIBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND MAYBE THROUGH IN THE COUNTRY AS WELL. AS WELL IS THE DIRECTION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GOING TO LOOK LIKE. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES WHAT'S OUT THERE IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF MEDICINE AND? MOST IMPORTANT IS TO BRING A MESSAGE BACK TO THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE TRUSTING US TO DO THE BEST THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. FOR THE CLIENTS. I FEAR EXHAUSTION. I FEAR EXHAUSTION OF THE GOOD WILL OF THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. WE MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE A VISION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO WHAT IS IMMEDIATELY PRESENT. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD? WHAT IS IT US? WHAT IS IT? GOING TO BE TO FAMILIES TO CLIENTS. I SHARE THIS WITH PASSION BECAUSE AFTER TWENTY YEARS. I STILL SEE. THE STRUGGLE [INAUDIBLE] SUSTAIN. WE STRUGGLE TO SUSTAIN WE FIND OURSELVES SATISFIED WITH. QUINCY. ONE ADVOCACY. I WANT COMPETENCE. THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. BY PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN. THE SUPPORT OF OF THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA. REALIZING THAT THERE IS A VISION THAT WE HAVE FOR TOMORROW. IT'S WORTH THEIR INVESTMENT THROUGH THEIR TAX DOLLARS. PLEASE I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER. IN ALL OF THESE DISCUSSIONS I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY'S BROUGHT TO ABOUT TO YOU THE NEED. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EQUAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ON THE PART OF REGIONAL CENTERS. ON THE PART OF ARCA ON THE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE LEGISLATURE FOR US TO SIT DOWN WITH SOME THE BEST MINDS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS A SYSTEM GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN TWENTY YEARS WHAT'S GOING TO COST US. MY GRANDDAUGHTER KAITLYN WILL BE FORTY YEARS OLD. WHAT WILL BE THERE FOR HER? AGAIN I JUST WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK ALL OF YOU ESPECIALLY CENTER CHESBRO. YOU WERE THE LIGHT FOR US SIR. YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN WELL SAID. AND HE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. SO NO WILL MOVE ON TO KIM NASH DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY SERVICE THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING HERE TO OUR AREA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU. CAN SEE WITH DENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT NEEDS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THAT AFFECTS THE WELLNESS OF EVERYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITY. ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER THANK YOU FOR ARE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND TO BE HERE TO HEAR WHAT WE SEE OUR NEEDS AS WELL AS WHAT'S WORKING SO WE CAN SHARE THOSE HIGHLIGHTS AS WELL. AND OF COURSE SENATOR CHARLES BRO IT IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AND SEE YOU CONTINUING TO BE A CHAMPION NOT ONLY FOR OUR AREA. BUT AS WELL FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND JENNIFER THANK YOU FOR PUTTING US ALL TOGETHER FOR US. WORK QUITE A BIT TO ORGANIZE. SOMEONE HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR EFFORTS GOING FORWARD WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AS WE KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE HOUSING PRICES ARE PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. CURRENTLY MOST INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM PEOPLE OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE. DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR WORK THROUGH OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST INITIATIVE AND THEY'LL BE SOME FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT IN ADDITION THAT THEY HAVE SAFE. UNIVERSALLY DESIGNED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOST OF THEIR INCOME IS FROM SUPPLEMENTAL SOCIAL SECURITY SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH. THE FAIR MARKET RENTS IN OUR AREA ARE VERY RURAL AREA. A RUNNY ONE BEDROOM SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT LEAVES MANY PEOPLE OF MANY ADULTS WITH ONLY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS LEFT OVER EACH MONTH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION. MEDICAL BENEFITS. AND VARIOUS OTHER FOOD AND RELATED EXPENSES. WE HAVE STARTED OUR INITIATIVES IN WORKING WITH THE WORLD COMMUNITY HOUSING IN A LOCAL. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. WE THANK YOU FOR OUR SUPPORTING AND APPROVING VARIOUS -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THAT CONTINUE. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN EVERY COUNTY FOR THAT WHICH WE WORK WITH. CURRENTLY WE ARE WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONE PARTICULAR AREA FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING MULTI FAMILY. IN WHICH WE WOULD HAVE BE ABLE TO SUPPORT UP TO TEN PEOPLE IN. HOUSING THAT MEETS ONLY 30% OF THEIR INCOME. WHICH QUALIFIES FOR TO BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IT'S CLOSE TO TRANSPORTATION AND THAT IT IS FULLY ACCESSIBLE REGARDLESS OF SOMEBODY'S PHYSICAL ABILITIES TO ACCESS THEIR DWELLING. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT WORK IN ORDER TO PARTNER WITH MANY OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND REPRESENTATIONS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THAT'S EXPENSE UP. TO DEVELOP MULTI HOUSE A MULTI UNIT DWELLING IS EXPENSIVE AND WE ARE. LUCKY TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH. WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL VETERANS SO THAT WE CAN POOL OUR MONEY TOGETHER AND POOL DEVELOPMENT MONEY TOGETHER TO APPLY FOR TAX CREDITS TO GET THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN. IN PLACE. THAT BEING SAID. WE WANTED TO CONTINUE TO URGE THAT THE SUPPORT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ADDITIONAL BILLS A DIFF TIONAL TAX CREDITS WHERE THEY MAY BE. TO CONTINUE OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE DO HAVE SOME BROCHURES ARE REGARDING SOME OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING EFFORTS WITH OUR DEVELOPER WHO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT -- TO EXPAND THAT WE WOULD LEAVE WITH YOU FOR YOU TO LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD WE WANTED TO BE ABLE -- TO SHARE THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPLOYMENT AND HOW THAT. CONNECTS WITH HOUSING WHEN WE HAVE SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE CAN HELP EXPAND. INTEGRATIVE COMPACT COMPLAINANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH C&LT;C.CYAN&GT; I SO I JUST ALSO WANT&LT;/C&GT; TO AND I PRIMARY MISTER I'M NOT VERY GOOD BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE AND AND THANKS. FOR BEING HERE SUPERVISOR -- REX BONE. AND SUPERVISOR VIRGIN BASS FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE LISTENING WITH US THIS MORNING. DID I MISS ANYBODY ELSE. GOOD I'M GLAD THAT'S A THAT'S A FIRST SO. IT'S REALLY WEIRD TO BE ON THE PODIUM IN WHICH I CAN SEEK OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO STEP ON A STOOL SO. THAT SUPER THRILLING -- SO MY NAME IS CHRIS MILLER AND I AM THE CLIENT ADVOCATE AT REDWOOD COAST REGIONAL CENTER. I'VE HELD THAT POSITION FOR THIRTEEN YEARS NOW. AND HAVE MET. UP WESLEY CHESBRO SEVERAL SEVERAL TIMES. AND ALWAYS ENJOY THAT OPPORTUNITY -- IT'S IT'S INTERESTING TO STAND UP HERE BECAUSE I AM ALSO A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY WHO RECEIVE SERVICES. TO I HAVE CEREBRAL PALSY AND DOT JUST A REALLY FUN LIFE EXPERIENCE IN CASE ANY OF YOU WHERE WONDERING -- AND MY GLASSES ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL TODAY SAID THAT SUPER. BUT PART OF THE REASON WHY I GOT INTO A WORKING REDWOOD COAST REGIONAL CENTER. IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK WITH IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH I'M ALSO A PART OF BECAUSE I FELT THAT IF I CAN. DO WITH THAT IF I GET INTO THIS WORK AND CAN YOU KNOW. DO SOMETHING THAT MATTERS THAT I WOULD BE HELPING EVERYBODY KIND OF SUCCEED AND WHEN WE ALL SUCCEED THAT'S A REALLY GREAT THING RIGHT. SO PART OF MY ROLE IT REDWOOD COAST IS TO GO IN TO SCHOOLS AND TALKED TO STUDENTS WHO ARE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. DO YOU KNOW WHAT NOT AND TALK THEM ABOUT. FURTHERING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FURTHERING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. BUT IN ALL MY YEARS AND DOING THAT I'VE NOTICED SOME BARRIERS. SO. YOU ALL GO TO SCHOOL AND PEOPLE ASK YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIVES AND YOU WANTED TO DO WHEN YOU GREW UP AND I'M SURE WESLEY CHESBRO SAID I WANT TO BE A STATE ASSEMBLY MAN AND THEN A SET. A SENATOR I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. SO. WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH WON'T YOU GUYS GET THAT EXPERIENCE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DON'T OFTEN? PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DON'T GET TO HAVE THE LAKE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES SO I'D GO INTO SCHOOLS AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE STARTED TO HAPPEN. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER YES. THEY HAVE NO Y. DE I AM THAT IS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE I THINK THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE STARTING PLANNING EARLIER WE SHOULD BE GIVING PEOPLE MORE SUPPORT. EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT THEY BETTER THEY ARE LIFE EXPERIENCE AND I THINK THAT LIKE EVERYBODY DESERVES THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT REGARDLESS OF DISABILITY OR NOT -- THE THINGS THAT I ALSO. TEND TO DO IS GO IN -- TO IS GO. SORRY I SKIPPED AHEAD OF MYSELF ANOTHER BARRIER THAT I SEE IS THAT WE HAVE WHEN LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A EMPLOYER BIAS. THEY ASSUME THAT BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS A DISABILITY THAT THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF DOING SOME JOB OR BECAUSE SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AND CAPABLE OF DOING SOME TO ARM I STAND UP HERE BEING ABLE TO TALK TO ALL OF YOU. BUT I HAVE. I KNOW THAT THE THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE IN VARIOUS STAGES THEY'VE HAPPENED TO ME YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY OF MY FRIENDS PEOPLE MISTAKE FOR MY YOU KNOW SUPPORT PERSON. AND SPEAK TO THEM INSTEAD OF ME THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I FIND THAT ENTERTAINING -- BUT IT'S IT'S A REALLY IT'S A REALLY KIND OF WEIRD EXPERIENCE BECOME THERE IS AN EMPLOYER BIAS BUT WHAT EMPLOYERS. DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW HIRING SOMEBODY WITH A DISABILITY NOT ONLY ADDS TO JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE VERY NICE PEOPLE AND GOOD FOR THEM BUT IT ADDS TO THE DIVERSITY. THE CULTURE AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THAT BUSINESS AND THAT CREATES REVENUE. AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT BUSINESS TO GROW. YOU KNOW SO I I SEE THAT AS BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM -- UNDER THAT THE ACT I DO A COUPLE THINGS BOTH LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE -- AS WELL AS GOING INTO SCHOOLS AND TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSITIONING FOR WORK OR EDUCATION I TALKED TO YOUNGER STUDENTS AND PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT DISABILITY AWARENESS. AND DISABILITY VISIBILITY WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK LIKE I UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO WE TEST. AND WE TAKE. YOU KNOW A PART IN THE GREATER WHOLE OF THE WORLD -- HEY AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I DEALS -- BUT I DO IT I TALK ABOUT DISABILITY WEARING MASKS AM I ALSO HAVE -- GO AND HAVE BEEN DOING STATE AND LOCAL ADVOCACY ON EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION AND DEVELOPING YOU KNOW EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND I THINK THAT THE VERY IMPORTANT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO PLEASE HELP ME IN THAT TASK WHEREVER YOU CAN. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO SIERRA BROWN'S TO TALK ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT FAKED INITIATIVE ARE YOU SEE I SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANNA SAY YOU'RE AMAZING. TO LOOK AT ACTUALLY. GOOD MORNING. I'M SIERRA BRAGS I AM THE CMS WAIVER AND EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST MANAGER IT RIGHT BECAUSE REGIONAL CENTER FOR HUMBLE AND DOWN COUNTIES. AND I AM REALLY EXCITED TO TALK WITH YOU GUYS ABOUT OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST INITIATIVE THIS MORNING -- BUT FIRST I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE -- THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THAT IN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HOW WE GOT HERE -- YOU KNOW OUR THIS CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER OUR STATE INSTITUTION CLOSED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND I THINK. YOU KNOW THAT IS. AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY THE WORK THAT OUR LEGISLATURE HAS DONE FOR THAT BUT THAT SELF ADVOCATES LIKE CHRIS MILLER AND MANY OTHERS IN THIS ROOM. I'M SAYING YOU KNOW WE DESERVE WE DESERVE A LIFE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE AND SO -- I THINK THAT'S JUST. ME ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS -- AND SO IT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE AS WE ARE LOOKING AT SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO HAVE MEANINGFUL LIVES YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MOST WORKING AGE ADULTS STILL IS. WE WORK AND SO GOING ALONG WITH WHAT CHRIS WAS SAYING ABOUT HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDDOS EARLY ABOUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GROW UP JUST LIKE WE TALKED WITH MANY OTHER TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILD -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PROMOTING AS PART OF OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY AND EMPLOYMENT FIRST IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW THE VERY FIRST OPTION THAT WE SHOULD GIVE WORKING AGE ADULTS. ON WHEN WE DO OUR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN IS. DO YOU WANT TO WORK IF YOU DO WANT TO WORK WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU WANT TO DO AND HOW CAN REGIONAL CENTER SUPPORT YOU TO DO THAT WORK AND TO DO IT WELL. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHIFT FOR US AND SO THAT'S A PART OF OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY IS TALKING WITH THOSE KIDDOS EARLY AND THEN AS THEY REACH ADULTHOOD. PUTTING THE SUPPORTS IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. I'M ANOTHER CENTRAL COMPONENT OF OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY IS COLLABORATION BECAUSE THERE IS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO EMPLOYMENT ALONE AND WE HAVE TO BE PARTNERING WITH OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY LIKE CHRIS SIDE SO THAT WE CAN -- REALLY DO SOME AWARENESS WITH THEM AROUND AND STATEMENT THAT THEY MAY HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS THAT THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEY MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE IT -- WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF REHAB THEY ARE THE EXPERTS IN -- EMPLOYMENT -- FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE ARE PARTNERING WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND AND OUR WORK ABILITY IN TRANSITION PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS AND OF COURSE WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SO WORKING TOGETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW IS OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZED AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY OR BETTER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE WELL SEQUENCE FUNDING TO SUPPORT PEOPLE TO WORK -- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THROUGH OUR LOCAL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WHICH FOR YOU KNOW PART OF THE CALIFORNIA BLUEPRINT FOR INTEGRATED COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN IN MENDOCINO COUNTY LAST YEAR WE SIGNED OUR FIRST LOCAL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTER MENDOCINO CELL BY AND DEPARTMENT OF REHAB AND SO THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTING. WHAT WERE CAUGHT YOU KNOW WE CALDWELL SEQUENCE FUNDING YOU KNOW HERE IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE LEAVING THERE'S NO CLIFF IT'S JUST A SEAMLESS TRANSITION FOR THE PERSON? IT ALL GOES WELL. AND WE ARE ROLLING OUT OUR LOCAL PARTNERSHIP HERE IN HUMBOLDT WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT SIGNED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED IN DOWN THERE WE SORT OF HAD OUR FIRST MEETING GREAT GET TO KNOW YOU LAST WEEK AND THEN I'M IN LATE CLOUT COUNTY THEY'VE HAD SEVERAL. GET TO KNOW USING THEY'VE DONE SEVERAL THINGS TOGETHER AND SO THEY'RE GETTING WORK GETTING WORKING THEIR LOCAL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TAIL. ON THANKS AS WE ARE GROWING RIGHT WE CONTINUE TO SERVE MORE MORE PEOPLE AT REBEL BECAUSE WE NOW SERVE OVER. FOUR THOUSAND INCREASE IN THE LAST [INAUDIBLE] AS WE PEOPLE IN THE SHOW ME THE MONEY DEFINING NINETY THREE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SAYING CAN I HAVE A AN ART IN SO WE DO HAVE A WONDERFUL SERVICE PROVIDERS MANY OF THEM IN THIS ROOM. WHO ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS RIGHT IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY WANT TO DEAL -- BUT THE CAPACITY WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY I AM CONSTANTLY HEARING FROM YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK AND THEN I'M LOOKING I'M CALLING OUR PROVIDERS AND SEEING IS THERE A PLACE FOR PEOPLE -- TO CERTAIN THEM AND SO IN THERE THERE'S JUST WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AND THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE IT'S ANY IT'S A UNIQUE SKILL SET TO DO WHAT WE CALL JOB DEVELOPMENT FINDING A PLACE. TO WORK AND TEACHING THAT EMPLOYER ABOUT. YOU KNOW STIGMA CAM AND ACCOMMODATIONS AND THEN ALSO -- PROVIDING ON THE JOB COACHING FOR THAT PERSON WHO WANTS TO WORK AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BRING TRAININGS HERE -- TO DO MORE -- RATING FOR THE WORK FORCE TO LEARN HOW TO DO JOB DEVELOPMENT AND JOB COACHING -- BUT TO SUSTAIN NETWORK FIRST WE ALSO NEED TO SINGLE RATES WE NEED PEOPLE ONCE THEY'RE TRAINED TO DO THAT THAT THIS THAT'S THEIR CAREER THEY WANT TO KEEP DOING ITS REALLY REWARDING WORK I MEAN. HELPING SOMEBODY GET A JOB AND KEEP THAT JOB IS ONE OF THE MOST FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO -- SO ANYWAYS THAT'S A THAT'S OUR EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY AND FIRST INITIATIVE AND I GIVE YOU GUYS A COPY OF THAT ARE -- PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE FUNDED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD EXPERIENCE WORKING TO REALLY GET THAT PAID WORK EXPERIENCE. BUILD THEIR RESUME AND FILL REALLY RECOGNIZED FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND WE HAVE SEEN IT TURN INTO JOBS FOR PEOPLE SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WELL. AND I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU GUYS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. WORKING AND AND THAT LOOKS LIKE SO I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER -- TO DOES HE HAVE A WEEK. HELLO IT'S AFTER RECONCILING. NOT ON THE RECORD YOU HAVE. THE MOVEMENT OF THE DIVERSITY OF REACH A COMPONENT OF THIS PANEL BACK. OUR DE CITY ON THE TRIP GRAHAM IS ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS. THANK THINGS HAPPEN. HI AT A REGIONAL CENTER AND I I GUESS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM ON THE PART OF OUR STAFF -- THAT -- REALLY ARE ENERGIZED BY THESE PROGRAMS AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THEM -- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR ARE OUT REACHED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- I'M SPEAKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSITY OUT REACH SPECIALIST -- MY ROAD SHOW OF SHOWS GEN HER. DEPENDS ON GRADUATION HE'S RECEIVING HIS MASTER'S DEGREE TODAY AND FOR SOME REASON SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO. SO ON THE THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE DATA THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US A SUGGESTS THAT THERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. IN THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT ARE PURCHASED. FOR ON OUR HEADS HISPANIC PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC AND PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS NATIVE. CAN IN OUR COMMUNITIES VERSUS WHITE [INAUDIBLE] WHITE. AMONG THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. ON IT'S IT'S TRIPLE -- FOR WHITES IT IS FOR HISPANICS IN THEIR SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES I IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- SO WE REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE A B. X. FUNDING THAT ENABLED US TO TO BE ABLE TO START A AN INITIATIVE THAT WE'RE ON WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WERE REALLY ENERGY. ENERGIZED ABOUT. SO OUR FIRST QUESTION AND LOOKING AT THESE DIFFERENCES AND SERVICES BEING PURCHASED BY PEOPLE PEOPLE ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS. IS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING. ON HOW DO WE EXPLAIN IT. SO -- WE'VE HELD PUBLIC MEETINGS. WE'VE HELD FOCUS GROUPS ON WE'VE GONE AND SPOKEN TO TRIBAL LEADERS. ON TO TRY -- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW IT IS WELL TO IT HI EDUCATE THEM ABOUT WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO? BUT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SERVICES THEY THINK THEY NEED. ARMY AND HOW THEY'D LIKE THEM PROVIDED -- MORE LEARNING -- AND BASED ON WHAT WE'RE LEARNING THESE ARE SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN. ON THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY A. B. X. FUNDING ONE IS THAT WE WE HAVE SOME REMOTE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED BOTH BECAUSE OF GEOGRAPHY. ON AND ALSO FOR CULTURAL REASONS. SO WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH FOLKS THAT WE CALL PARENT MENTORS. ANA I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THE PROM A TORAH APPROACH WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT -- THESE ARE. PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. ON THEY COME FROM THE SAME CULTURAL BACKGROUND. ON THEY MAY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. ON ME AND THEY ACT AS AMBASSADORS FOR OUR SYSTEM.

MENTALLY PHYSICALLY FINANCIALLY. REALLY HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON MY LIFE AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT ARE WILLING TO HELP ME AND WATCH ME SUCCEED. AND I REALLY JUST COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT WE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY AS SMALL AS THIS ONE THAT HAS SO MANY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. INCLUDING DOLERITE.

TRY MY BEST -- SO I GET TO GO TO TRAJECTORY AND I'VE BEEN GOING FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I GET -- TO WORK ON MY ART THERE AND I WENT TO SEE OUR FOR A COUPLE SEMESTERS AFTER I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND I TOOK A CERAMICS CLASS. I WANTED TO DO CERAMICS MORE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT AT HOME I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A KILN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

THERE. OKAY. I DO OWN I HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF JOB SECURITY AND I'M AFRAID TO LOSE MY JOB BY. I HAVE HAD A COUPLE JOBS IN THE PAST NINE TO GET FIRED AT ONE POINT SO. NOW I GET TO GO TO MY I'M IN I DO MY JOB AND I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. MAYBE NOT BEING ABLE TO COME IN THE NEXT DAY AND I LIVE IN MCKINLEY BILL AND I CAN'T DRIVE IN SO THE REGIONALS CENTER GIVE ME BUS PASSES. SO I CAN TAKE THE BUS TO WORK. SOME OF MY MOM DOESN'T HAVE TO DRIVE ME. IN THE OWN. I AM THE I GET TO FEEL PRODUCTIVE AT MY JOB AND I HELP MAKE A SHELF IN IN THE TABLE AND I AM I GUESS AND DO THINGS MY HANDS. I LIKE THAT AND MAKES ME FEEL ACCOMPLISHED AND I REALLY APPRECIATE MY JOB AND I GET TO DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED AND HAVING A JOB IN THE ARTS AND I WILL GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. NOT ALL THAT I WROTE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL -- WITH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY OFFICE CATION. BUDGET. MACY'S. IF I BUTCHERED YOUR NAME I APOLOGIZE RIGHT THANK YOU AND I WROTE A COLLEAGUE SHALL BE PETERSON. AND I KNOW -- TODAY WHEN I WAS ASKED TO COME I DIDN'T REALLY PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION. THAN ANYTHING AND SO MY JOB AT THE COUNTY OFFICES I'M A PRINCIPAL AND I'M A PROGRAMS BIRTH. TO FIVE FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND IT'S BASICALLY EARLY INTERVENTION AND THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS WITHIN THAT CERTIFIED. I'M THE ONE I'M GONNA TALK A BIT ABOUT MORE TO DATE IS A COLLABORATIVE WITH REGIONAL CENTER AND WE DO RUN -- TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- AND ONE IS VENDOR RICE REGIONAL CENTER AND THAT'S AN EIGHTEEN MONTH A THREE YEAR OLD CLASSROOM. AND WE HAVE THREE CLASSROOMS HERE AND THIS AND THAT SERVE CHILDREN. SO I KNOW EARLIER -- ONE OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT -- THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY INTERVENTION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT SHELBY BECAUSE WE ARE -- WE'RE VERY CLAPPING TOGETHER INTO ONE FORGET ANYTHING -- SO WHAT'S WORKING WELL HERE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY ONE IS THAT COLLABORATION AND I THINK IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING AWAY TODAY. IT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AGENCIES AND ALSO PRIVATE BUSINESS BE ABLE TO BE INCENTIVIZE TO WORK. AND CREATE RELATIONSHIPS AND SO -- THE ONE WITH THE I. REGIONAL CENTER STARTED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO I'VE BEEN WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. AND WE HAD A NEED WE HAD -- CHILDREN OUGHT TO THAT WERE. SINCE SOME OF YOU WE AND EARLY INTERVENTION BECAUSE WE KNOW REALLY GOOD INTER INTER EARLY INTERVENTION -- AT MAKES LAST SEEN OUTCOMES RIGHT SO AND THE EARLIER YOU GET CHILDREN THE BETTER THE OUTCOME SO -- FROM FOUR TO ONE HUGE DIFFERENCE IF YOU GET CHILDREN. SO -- THIS PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP WITH REGIONAL CENTER -- WAS BECAUSE WE HAD A GOOD WORKING DIALOGUE AND WHICH IS NOT COMMON IN THE STATE I'M WELL MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER PARTS OFTEN TALK ABOUT. UNDER CHALLENGES WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTER FROM THE SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE AND I'M SURE THE REVERSE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE -- BUT YOU'RE WERE SMALL COMMUNITY AND WE SEE EACH OTHER AT THE GROCERY STORE AND WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS SO -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AT TO HAVE THIS -- MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT. AND SO -- DOT THAT CLASSROOM WHICH USED TO BE ONE CHILD EARLY -- IS NOW THREE CHILDREN -- THREES GIVE ME THREE CLASSROOMS FOR CHILDREN EIGHT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. TO THREE AND WE SERVE CHILDREN WITH AUTISM BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT DISABILITY NECESSARILY THEY CAN HAVE SOME ARE LIKE CHARACTERISTICS SO THEY CAN HAVE DEFICITS IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR. AND BE SERVED BY THAT CLASSROOM -- AND THE REASON WE HAVE THREE IS -- FAMILIES LOVE THEM. AND THEY REALLY HAVE GREAT OUTCOMES AND SO -- THEY'RE VERY NOW. IN DEVELOPMENTAL SO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHEN THEY WALK IN. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM AND IT FEELS LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO THE FAMILY AS WELL AS A CHILD BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIRTH TO FIVE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST SERVING THE CHILDREN. BUT THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WORKED REALLY WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CLASSROOM ITSELF BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOUR BACKGROUND. AND EARLY INTERVENTION WHAT YOU KNOW OR YOU DON'T KNOW -- AND SO I THINK IF YOU COULD HAVE A PICTURE OF WHAT THAT IT. AND I THINK D. M. BIGGEST BENEFIT FOR FAMILIES IS THERE NOT HAVING TO GO THROUGH SEPARATIST CESSNA PROCESSES. AND THEN BECAUSE WE HAVE FAMILIES I HAVE FAMILY THAT DROVE FROM RED WAY THIS WAY WEEK THREE TIMES FOR ASSESSMENTS. THEY HAD TO DO THAT TWICE FOR EACH AGENCY WHEN THEY TURNED THREE THAT CREATES A BEAR FOR ACCESSING SERVICES. AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING A CLASSROOM THAT SET UP LIKE A TODDLER CENTER IS THAT CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES -- WHERE MAYBE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH ABA PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S THAT AND SPACE ACTORS FOR CHILDREN IN A SERIES OF THE TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER? BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED THOSE SAYS BECAUSE FOR OUTCOMES LATER IN LIFE. IF WE CAN CHANGE OUR TRAJECTORY THEY'RE GONNA NEED LESS SERVICES AS THEY GET OLDER. I'M IN ADDITION A THINK WHAT'S UNIQUE IN A BARRIER RIGHT NOW THAT WAS SPOKEN TO EARLIER. IS THAT OUR COUNTY HAS THE HIGHEST ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE NUMBERS IN THE STATE. WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A LITTLE TWO YEAR OLD? MAYBE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA OR THEY HAVE -- OTHER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GOING ON IN THE HOME THAT CHILD CAN LOOK LIKE A CHILD AUTISM. AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ARE YOU GOING TO DENY THEM SERVICES BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH ACES SCORES BECAUSE WE THINK IT MIGHT BE THAT WELL WE DON'T DO THAT IN THIS COUNTY. THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE THINK IT MIGHT BE AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IS THE STATE AS WE LOOK AT WHAT NEEDS ARE FOR SERVICES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT. IN ADDITION THE COUNTY OFFICE HAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ZERO EIGHT MENTAL HEALTH COOPERATIVE THAT MAKE WALKLEY INVEST HEAVILY IN HAVE BEEN A PART OF IN REALLY TRYING TO EDUCATE. INDIVIDUALS THAT -- TO BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE NEEDS HOW DO THEY GET INTO THOSE. AND SO HAVING FUNDING FOR OTHER QUALITY INTERVENTION I THINK IS CRITICAL. OR THAT PACIFIC DIAGNOSIS REALLY THAT'S WHAT THE TICKET IS SET TO GET INTO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THE OTHER PART OF HIM AGAIN AS THEY WERE RULES SO OUR FAMILIES ARE TRAVELING REALLY FAR TO GET TO THESE SERVICES. AND THE OTHER BIG THING WHICH I KNOW IT M. YOU KNOW PART THE COUNTY OFFICE IS PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF LIKE RANTS RIGHT NOW WE'RE PART OF THE CITY IT'S A SUPPORT INCLUSIVE PRACTICES GRANT AND WE'VE APPLIED FOR TWO OTHER GRANTS. TO CREATE MORE INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES IS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO GENERAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOLS. AND CHILDCARE FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES IF YOU. HAVE A CHILD WITH A DISABILITY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME FINDING CARE. AND A GOOD CARE AND SO -- IS SPECIFICALLY THIS COUNT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS FOR THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS ARE TALKING PROVIDERS CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH KIDS THEY WANT. AND SO I HAVE A NUMBER OF KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF PRESCHOOLS NUMBERS OF TIMES I THINK THAT'S AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S ALSO BEEN NOTED ABOUT THE THE HIGH RATE. THAT HIGH RATE HAPPENING -- SO HAVING -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE INCLUSIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH -- NO PRIVATE PRESCHOOLS OR A NOTE AND STATE PRESCHOOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER GREAT THING FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT I KNOW STATE PRESCHOOLS AND HAVE STARTS ARE SUPPOSED TO SERVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF KIDS WELL I'M WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS. BUT WOULDN'T FRANKLY IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE MORE MILD NEEDS AT END OF ACCESSING THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS THE CHILDREN WHO ARE MORE UNIQUE NEEDS LIKE KIDS WITH AUTISM OR OTHER TYPES OF DISABILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME -- THOSE AGENCIES JUST DON'T HAVE THE SKILL SET OR THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW MEET THOSE KIDS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND SO -- I KNOW THAT -- WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE IS MORE PARTNERSHIPS IS I'M WILLING TO PARTNER WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE? TO RUN CLASSROOMS -- SO WE HAVE THAT AND FOR INCLUSION REAL INCLUSION YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE EQUITY WE HAVE TO HAVE BE ABLE TO MEET KIDS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THAT DOES MEAN THINKING DIFFERENTLY THAT MEAN LOOKING AT YOUR RESOURCES DIFFERENTLY. AND THEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MANDATED TO PROVIDE IT IS SOME TYPE OF INCENTIVE TO DO IT -- SO UP HERE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES AS YOU GUYS GO BACK TO THAT ARE. THERE REALLY STRUCK. COOL IN CHILDCARE. WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET KIDS I NEED. IN PRESCHOOL THAT JUST GOES ALONG WITH YOU I MEAN YOU GROW UP WITH THAT EXPECTATION. THE KIDS YOU GO TO PRESCHOOL WITH GREW UP WITH THAT EXPECTATION AS WELL THAT THAT JUST WITH NORMAL LOOKS LIKE IS RANGE OF PEOPLE. AND THEIR FAMILIES EXPECTED AS WELL AND SO -- UP HERE THAT'S THAT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING I KNOW THAT'S CHALLENGING ACROSS THE STATE -- I I TRAVEL AROUND FOR THIS POSITION AND I GET TO SEE OTHER PROGRAMS. LAST WEEK WE WERE AN LA LOOKING AT THEIR INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS. THEY'RE VERY RICH DISTRICTS THAT ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT -- AND THEIR CLOSE TOGETHER SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES THAT WE DO -- BUT SO YOU KNOW -- WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU AND IN SOME WAYS IS THAT WHAT THE THINGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL AS THAT COLLABORATION AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND I THINK THAT'S CHALLENGING WHEN YOU HAVE? YOU KNOW CASE MANAGERS WHO HAVE HIGH CASELOADS THAT THEY CAN'T -- THIS IS OUR ENGAGE IN THE SAME WAY THEY WANT -- TO AND WE HAVE LIMITED SERVICE PROVIDERS SO YOU OR MAYBE THE HAVE CERTAIN PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY BUT YOU CAN'T FIND OTHER PEOPLE TO WORK WITH -- BUT THEN AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THAT. AT THIS LOCAL LEVEL WERE REALLY TRYING TO MAXIMIZE AND EFFECTIVELY USE ALL OUR RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S IT THE THING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU CAN DO A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. YOU HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE TO UTILIZED EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES -- SO I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I CAN I CAN TALK A LOT. ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND I BUT I WANT TO STAY ON POINT. THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT [INAUDIBLE] WILTON. IT CAME FROM THE HEART. WE'RE GOING TO CONNECT LATER ON TO TO TALK ABOUT. ADVANCING WHICH WERE DISCUSSED SO THANK YOU. DOES HERE. THIS IS A WARM MOMENT CAPTAIN YEAH ZERO BREAKS IS BACK UP. I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TURN IT OVER TO DR SMALLEY -- SO BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT WAR BLAME BRIEFLY THEY ARE ONE OF OUR PARTNERS THEY'RE BASED IN SACRAMENTO BUT THEY'RE THAT PARENT TRAINING AND INFORMATION CENTER. AND SO THE NEW HEARD WHEN I WAS TALKING BEFORE ABOUT COLLABORATION IS SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART SO PART OF WHAT -- I'VE DONE IN MY PREVIOUS ROLE OF REGIONAL CENTER IS COLLABORATE WITH MORE MIND -- TO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE IN OUR FOR COUNTIES TO ACCESS THAT RESOURCE BECAUSE THEY DO COVER ARE FOR COUNTIES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BASED IN SACRAMENTO SO WE PARTNER WITH THEM. AND THEY COME UP HERE IN THE OFFER TRAININGS TO FAMILIES I'M AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE THAT AN ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CHILD TO GET THEIR NEEDS MET IN THE SCHOOL SETTING -- AND THAT WE MET THEM THROUGH OUR THE CAPTAIN THE CALIFORNIA ON SOME SPECIAL TRAINING AND INFORMATION NETWORK AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR SMALLEY WHOSE ARE AUTISM CLINICAL SPECIALIST AND CAN MUCH BETTER SPEAK TO THAT I THINK YOUR CONDUCTOR. THANK YOU -- I HAVE -- WELL LIKE ALL CLINICIANS OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AND ALL CONDITIONS IN OUR WORLD COMMUNITY. I WEAR MULTIPLE HATS. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF US. IN THE REGION CENTER OR IN OUR TOWN TO GO AROUND RIGHT. SO I AM THE AUTISM CLINICAL SPECIALIST. I AM ALSO THE BEHAVIOR ANALYST FOR ALL FOR COUNTIES. AND I AM ALSO THE PERSON WHO REGIONAL CENTER HAS WHO WORKS WITH A KNOWS A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT SPECIAL ED LAW. FULL INCLUSION INTEGRATION -- PARENT EDUCATION PARA RIGHTS ETCETERA -- I'M ALSO THE PERSON WHO TRAINS ARE LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS ON WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY'RE IN SOMEBODY WITH AUTISM. I'M ALSO THE PERSON WHO TRAINS ARE LOCAL OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS AND FIREMAN ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE ON THE SCENE. SO THAT TAKE AWAY POINT THERE IS YOU IN ANY OF THE PEOPLE COME UP AND SPOKE TO YOU. WE ARE ONE HUMAN WITH. THREE FIVE SEVEN ROLES -- WE ARE WORKING TREMENDOUSLY HARD AND DOING FABULOUS THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THE NEED OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY IN EVERY AREA -- WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL PEOPLE TO GET JOB TRAINING AND TO WORK WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGENCIES OR WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLINICIANS OR SERVICE COORDINATORS. NEED OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY OKAY. ON THE CALIFORNIA AUTISM PART IN TRAINING INFORMATION NETWORK ACTUALLY. HE HE LEFT THAT CAME OUT OF THE ORIGINAL BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. AND IT WAS THE IDEA THAT WE WE HAVE AN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF OF INDIVIDUALS LABELED AUTISM STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE HIGHEST -- WATCH WORKS LET'S STOP FINDING THINGS THAT DON'T WORK LET'S ACTUALLY MAKE SOME SOME DIFFERENCE AND LET'S DO IT AS SOON AS WE CAN. AND CAPTAIN IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS THE SELF AS THE REGIONAL CENTER -- THE UNIVERSITY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THE FEDERALLY MANDATED PARENT TO PARENT ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT IS A ONE LINE IS OUR VERSION OF THAT HERE -- BUT IN THESE FOUR COUNTIES WE DON'T HAVE A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE. I DON'T HAVE A UNIVERSITY CENTER YOU SAID HERE. AND OUR PARENTS PARENT NETWORK IS HOUSE OUT OF SACRAMENTO DO WONDERFUL THINGS THEY COME IN THEY TELL HEALTHY DO TRAININGS. THEY ARE ONE LINE IS FABULOUS. BUT I DON'T HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ME ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS IN THE SAME WAY THAT OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO OR LA DOES. WE DO KNOW WHAT WORKS WE DO KNOW WHAT BEST PRACTICES ARE WE WE THE RIGHT AWAY WE DO KNOW WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT AND IMPLEMENTED WITH CONFIDENCE THANK YOU STEVE AND NOT ADEQUACY -- IS A EVERY DAY PERPETUAL STRUGGLE -- I GOT HERE. AT TWELVE YEARS AGO AND WE HAD. ONE AB A PROVIDER. ONE FOR ALL FOR COUNTIES. WE NOW HAVE. SIX THAT'S FABULOUS WE HAVE FORTY BOARD CERTIFIED BE AROUND UNLESS IF YOU SPEAK TO ANY OTHER REGIONAL CENTER. ANY OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THE NUMBER FORTY IS RIDICULOUS. WE SIMPLY NOT HAVE NOT PROVIDERS TO AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER AT AT THE SAME [INAUDIBLE] PROVIDE ALL. OUR SERVER WHOSE NEEDS -- EXCEED THE WHAT THE SYSTEM IS DO STATEWIDE -- WE HAVE THAT SAME ME JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER REGIONAL CENTER DOES. THE LACK THE RESOURCES LACK THE ACTUAL PEOPLE LACK ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GO AROUND TO SERVE THOSE CHALLENGING FOLKS -- THE GOOD NEWS IS EVERYONE SAID AS WE ARE SMALL COMMUNITY WE DO WORK TOGETHER WE DO FIGURE IT OUT KID BY KID ADULT BY ADULT HUMAN BY HUMAN. AND SO I THINK IN MANY WAYS WERE LEADING THE STATE ON SOME OF THE CREATIVE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO ENSURE PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN THEIR HOME. IN SUPPORTED LIVING AND DON'T END UP IN A LARGE CONGREGATE CARE OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY -- BUT WE NEED HELP. YOU KNOW. THERE'S ONLY ONE ME. AND THERE'S ONLY SIX AGENCIES. THEY ARE THE SAME VENDORS SERVE THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THAT SERVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE SPUR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. THE ALL OF THE CONTRACTING FUNDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. BY SERVICES FROM THE SAME SIX COMPANIES THAT'S ALL THERE IS. AND AND THEY ARE A HUGE INCREASE FROM JUST TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE ONLY HAD. ONE SO -- CAPTAIN IS IMPERATIVE PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORTING CAPTAIN -- I THINK WHEN IT YOUR OTHER MEETINGS YOU PROBABLY HEARD. ABOUT ON CAPTAIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CAPTAIN WITH FOR THE SELF A SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE DID START IN THE SCHOOLS WE DID START WITH EARLY INTERVENTION WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN ARE HAVING INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS. AND REALLY LEARNING AND LEAVING SCHOOL WITH ACTUAL SKILLS UNDER THEIR BELT. BUT NOW IS SOME THERE'S SOME TIME UNDER IT NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE EXITING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH AUTISM HAVE COME UP ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OR AGING OUT. AND THE ADULTS SERVICE MODEL MAY OR MAY NOT BE PREPARED TO SERVE THEM IN THE MANNER THAT THEY EXPECT A MANNER THAT THEY DESERVE. OR SPECIFIC NEEDS BEING MET BECAUSE OF AUTISM. AND SO NOW I THINK YOU'LL HEAR REGIONAL CENTER PLAYING A BIGGER AND BIGGER ROLE. IN -- CAPTAIN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU DOCTOR I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION NINE INNING I'VE RECOGNIZES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF LACK OF PROVIDERS. FOR ALL OF THE STATE. AND THE DOT DOCTOR WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT HOW WE CREATE A MODEL FOR CAREER. AND CERTIFICATION FOR BETTER WAGES AND AND WHAT NOT AND WE'RE GONNA BE. WORKING ON THAT TOGETHER. WHAT'S YOUR WAIT LIST. SO THE REASON IT DOESN'T HAVE A WAIT LIST WE DON'T. WOULD ALLOW IT WE DON'T BELIEVE IN IT FIGURED OUT PERSON BY PERSON -- WITHIN THE INSURANCE MANDATE COMING IN THAT VERY DESPERATE COMPLICATED THINGS I I WORKED IN NINE OTHER STATES BEFORE I CAME HERE AND I ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THAT IS A GODSEND. EVERYWHERE -- BUT MUCH LIKE GENEVIEVE EXPLANATION OF DAY CARES BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW TAKE THE EASIER CHILD. WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE FUNDED INSURANCE COMPANY -- OR THE REGIONAL CENTER THAN PEOPLE WITH SEVERE NEEDS PEOPLE WITH SEVERE CHALLENGES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE SIR. BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER ENDING REFERRALS FOR LITTLE PEOPLE WHO NEED SERVICES RIGHT NOW SO UNFORTUNATELY OUR POPULATIONS ARE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER. FOR SERVICES I DON'T HAVE A WAIT LIST BUT I DEFINITELY HAVE PEOPLE WHO SERVED. TO HAVE -- HOURS AND HOURS WRAP THEM IN NEED FOR COMPETENCY TO GO WITH THAT ADEQUACY. I DON'T HAVE ANYONE WHO IS GOING WITHOUT. BUT I AM MAKING SHIFT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO I WOULD LOVE TO TO YOUR LIST OF UNDERSERVED. SO WE DON'T CALL IT AWAY. AND ANOTHER WAS I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS. HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW. DESPAIRED OF CARE. WE CAN BE MORE HELPFUL THAT'S WHEN THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR. AGAIN WE NEED TO KNOW. AND WITH THE CHILD CARE SITUATION AND ALSO -- ABA OR ANY OTHER SERVICES THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE HAVING. LESS THAN YOU WOULD DESIRE. AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THAT. WE WOULDN'T WE NEED TO KNOW IS HOW WE CAN DO THAT BUT ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS AND WE FOUND WITH MAY REVISE. WAS THAT THE GOVERNOR IGNORE AND THE BRIDGE FUNDING. ABSOLUTELY BILLION DOLLARS. GOING FORWARD -- AND SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN. USE AS AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THROUGH THE DDS OUT TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS. AS NOT ONE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A KIND OF ONE OUT OF THE BOX YEAH YOU KNOW KIND OF THINKING SO. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS RIGHT BECAUSE REGIONAL STRENGTH. OUT OF THE BOX -- WE ARE CONSTANTLY CREATING THINGS AT THE PERSON LEVEL FOR THE PERSON SO THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET -- BUT NO WE NEED MORE SPANISH SPEAKING STAFF WE NEED A CAREER PATH FROM THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE B. C. B. A OR THE EDUCATION OR CLINICAL PROGRAM -- WITH WORLD WE HAVE -- DIFFERENT NEEDS -- BUT NO LESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE PRESERVATION I LOVE YOUR PASSION THANK. GOD. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU TALKED ABOUT -- THE STRENGTH WHEN THE STRINGS OF OF BEING -- THE AREA IS THAT OUT OF THE BOX DO YOU FEEL IN ANY WAY THAT -- YOU'RE CONSTRAINED BY SOME OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS I MEAN. DO YOU DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO DO WHAT IT IS TODAY BUT YOU WANT TO DO I NEED ON A PERSON BY PERSON BASIS OR IS THERE A ARE THE CHALLENGES OF FLEXIBILITY WE OFTEN FIND GOVERNMENT THAT. THEIR STRINGS ATTACHED TO EVERYTHING AND I MEAN ANSWER THAT CAREFULLY I I'VE WORKED WITH OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS -- AND I DID EXPERIENCE THAT IN OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS I DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT HERE. THE THIS COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT -- WE DO SIT DOWN AND GO HOW DO WE FIX THIS WHERE WE FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN -- THE CLINICIAN IN HOUSE TEACH THAT. OF WHO CAN ADJUST AND RISE TO THE OCCASION AND THANKFULLY ARE MANY ALWAYS DOES -- WE ALSO HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEM RIGHT WE WE DON'T PUT PEOPLE INSTITUTIONS WE SERVE PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME IN THEIR FAMILY THAT IS. THAT IS OUR VISION AND THAT IS OUR BELIEF AND BECAUSE THAT IS SHARED WITH OUR PARTNERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND AND WE ALL YOU KNOW KIND OF LOT OLD HIPPIES MOVED UP HERE WAY BACK WHEN -- WE DO SERVE PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES. AND MY EXPERIENCE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WERE LIKE WELL NO WE DON'T DO THAT -- THERE'S A CALF OR THERE'S A SPECIAL PLACE FOR THAT. DON'T DO IT HERE IT IS PERSON CENTERED IT IS PERSON BY PERSON -- AND WE'RE LUCKY IN THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PULL IT OFF SO FAR. BUT AS THE THE BUBBLE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD -- COMES UP THROUGH THE SYSTEM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE AND CHALLENGING NEEDS -- PEOPLE DON'T COMMUNICATE LIKE YOU AND I DO ARE ALL STILL IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW -- THEY'RE THEY'RE COMING UP THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE WAVE BEHIND THEM IS JUST HIGHER IT'S IT'S NOT LESSER. AND WE YES THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IN THE ADULT SERVICE PROVIDER SYSTEM HALF TO GEAR UP. TO SERVE YOU KNOW IN EXPONENTIALLY LARGER AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOLS. WHO NEED HOUSING MANY JOBS IN IN OUR MAKE INTERNAL TURNED OF COMMUTE XIN? ANY PLACE TO GO AND PEOPLE TO DO AND SUPPORT STAFF TO DO IT AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND. WELL I JUST WANT. WE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE ALLOW YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO TO DO THE JOB IN THE WAY THAT OUR REGION ABSOLUTELY NEEDS THIS. SURE RICK CAN GIVE YOU A LIST I JUST. REAL QUICK. ONE RISK. THAT HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC IN HELPING HER ACHIEVE WHAT SHE'S LOOKING AT IS TO PROVIDE ROUND THE CLOCK SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND WISH TO LIVE WITH. FAMILIES ARE LIVE AT HOME AND NOT GO TO A GROUP HOME. OUR ABILITY TO USE SOMETHING SUCH AS A SUPPORTER LIVING SERVICE IS RESTRICTED FOR ONLY EIGHTEEN AND ABOVE. AND SO THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO TRY TO ACCESS THE NUMBER OF CLINICIANS TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT PACKED SUPERVISION SKILLS TRAINING AND SUPPORT. I WAS VERY STRETCH WHEN KIM'S REFERENCING THE SIX AGENCIES THAT TO WE HAVE TO PULL FROM TO DO AROUND THE CLOCK SO THAT IS ONE AREA IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT WE SIT TOGETHER WE STRING APART. THAT IS ONE REGULATION. I THINK AND OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS -- OTHER SYSTEMS I THINK IT OTHER SYSTEMS -- THERE ARE CHOICES THAT THOSE -- OFFICIALS HAVE THAT WE WOULDN'T SHE IS BUT WE ALSO DON'T HAVE RIGHTS WE DON'T SEND PEOPLE OUT OF THE AREA WE DON'T SEND PEOPLE TO LOCK FACILITIES WE DON'T HAVE NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE ONLY HAVE SIX NON PUBLIC AGENCIES -- I THINK THERE ARE FIFTY IN THE IN THE BAY AREA I USED TO WORK FOR YOU SEVERAL OF THEM AND WITH MANY OF THEM. NONE OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS IN OUR FOR COUNTIES. AND I WOULDN'T CHOOSE TO PUT SOMEBODY IN A LOCKED FACILITY AND WITH THAT IS NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM HERE. BUT KNOW THAT ANOTHER REGIONAL CENTER COULD MAKE THAT CHOICE AND MIGHT OF THAT -- SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND WE DON'T WE JUST SIMPLY HAVE TO SOLVE IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN TIME IN OR GENDER THAT WE'RE PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND THIS IS WHERE WE HEAR FROM YOU. SO LOVE YOU TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR STORY. TELL US YOUR NAME AND PLEASE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK. LET ME ACOSTA A COUPLE MINUTES EACH AND IF WE DO HAVE MORE TIME -- GOING FORWARD. AND WE ADDRESS THAT WE CAN HAVE YOU COME BACK UP IN AND ADDED. TO IN ADDITION. SO THANK YOU AND PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND SHARE WITH US YOUR CHALLENGES OR YOUR HAPPINESS SEWER. HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN YOUR LIFE? THANK YOU SO PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME IN THE SENATE -- MY NAME IS ANDREA Q.. ONE AM -- COMMUNITY NUMBER THAT -- PROVIDE SUPPORT. TO THE COMMUNITY. AND SPANISH SPEAKING BILINGUAL BICULTURAL. N.. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- WHAT'S. BEING WORKING WHAT -- IN REACHING OUT THE THOSE WHO -- ONE ON THE FAR END OF THE NEED THOSE WHO ARE THE MINORITY -- REGIONAL CENTER HAS PROVIDED -- WITH THEIR OUTREACH -- DIVERSE YEAH RICH FUNDING HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. SERVICES TO THOSE WHO ARE SPANISH SPEAKING -- DOING THE PARENT SUPPORT GROUP. FACILITATING THOSE -- IN THE SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY. AND BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT AND EDUCATE AND ENCOURAGE AND GIVE HOPE. TO THOSE WERE -- MOSTLY AFRAID. AND ARE. FEARFUL OF COMING OUT. INVITED FAMILIES AND ENCOURAGE THEM. TO COME HERE AND SPEAK. AND I TOLD THEM I ONCE STAND WITH THEM. TOO TRANSLATION NEEDED -- BUT FEAR IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE ENCOUNTER. IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF A SOMEHOW IT OKAY PROFESSIONAL COMES IN AND TRIES TO GIVE THEM HOPE -- IT'S IT'S NOT ENOUGH -- REGIONAL CENTER HAS DONE A FANTASTIC. JOB AND AND IN TRYING TO PROMOTE -- AND HOW -- TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE THROUGH THE RADIO AT GOING TO COLLEGE AND GIVING AWARENESS TO THE COMMUNITY YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT -- BUILDING AN EDUCATIONAL PATH -- WE'RE DOING IT FROM THE FROM THE BASELINE BRINGING AWARENESS -- SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME AND WE REPRESENT INCLUDE. JEFF POCKET ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR REACHING FOR INDEPENDENCE. I WE ARE AN ADULT DAY PROGRAM -- CURRENTLY REGION FOR INDEPENDENCE OPERATES -- THREE COMMUNITY DO YOU CARE LICENSED FACILITIES AND HUMBLE AND DONOR COUNTY. I'M I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S COME OUT IN TODAY'S MEETING IS THAT THERE IS REALLY NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR ANY SERVICES OFFERED UP -- THERE'S A NEED FOR EVERYTHING THERE'S A NEED FOR DAYZ SUPPORT THERE'S A NEED FOR DAY PROGRAM THERE'S A NEED FOR SUPPORTED LIVING -- I THINK AS THE VENDOR OR A AS A SERVICE PROVIDERS PERSPECTIVE WHICH I'VE YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU BALLS AND TO SHARE THAT -- IT CAN'T BE ONE SIZE ALL WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING THAT YOU THERE -- FOR ME AS AS A AS A BUSINESS PERSON IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT A REGIONAL CENTER HAS THE OPTION TO HAVE THE NEGOTIATED RATE TO PROVIDE. A FUNDING LEVELS IT CAN SUPPORT -- THE BUSINESS AT HAND. THE RATE STUDY MODELED IT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD TO LEGISLATURE I THINK HAS SOME -- GEN AND IT'S IT'S BEEN FROM. AT A RATE OF SIX HUNDRED SUSTAINABLE -- DOT WOULD PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AS A CARE LESSONS PROVIDER. I THINK HAVING A NEGOTIATED RATE. GIVES RESOURCE CENTER THE OPTION OR THE AVAILABILITY -- TO PAY FOR A SERVICE THAT SHOWS OUTCOMES. AND IF IT'S ONE FLAT RATE. YOU'RE GONNA GET THE SAME OUTCOME EVERY SINGLE TIME THANK YOU -- FOR THAT REMINDER AND I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG TIME IN IN AND I HAVE SURE THAT WAS YOU BUT I DO THINK THAT -- BY LIMITING NOT A BILL. THE LEADER FUND PROGRAMS PUTS OUR CLIENTS AT RISK I'M IMPRISONMENT YOU KNOW IN ADEQUATE SITUATIONS. UNDERFUNDED THE STATE HAS UNDER FUNDED HUMAN SERVICES FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF SAVED MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO GO BACKWARDS ISN'T THE TIME TO MOVE FORWARD.

QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT HERE AND AND MUSTAFA YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO BE. REALLY SERIOUSLY LOOKED AT AND PROVIDING YOU KNOW DOING WHAT YOU CAN DOES BEST TO PROVIDE US A LIVING WAGE FOR LESS SUPPORT PROVIDERS -- FROM A DAY TO DAY BASIS FROM CERTAIN THINGS YOU'RE SETTING UP OF DOING OF SEVEN POINT MENTAL SCHEDULE SCHEDULING MEDICATIONS OVERSEEING A CLIENT'S MEDICATIONS FILLING MEDICATIONS.

MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS COUNSELING IN ABOVE THESE YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF SITUATIONS WITH IT WITH A MEDICAL EMERGENCY COMES UP BUT I HAVE A CLIENT -- ABOUT A YEAR AGO HAVE LITTLE IN THE FALL -- WILL HE'S PADDED PAST NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE TO HIS MEANS HE NEEDS THE IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUSTICE CRITICAL FALL HE'S GOING DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO. WITHIN YOU KNOW MOVIES GET. VERY MUCH WHEN HE FALLS YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE SETTING HIM UP HERE YOU HAVE TO FIND STAFF IN YOUR FOR VETTING YOU FUNDING HERE OF GETTING A HOLD OF THE SERVICE COORDINATORS HERE TO GET HIM DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO -- THAT'S TOUGH STUFF YOU GOT TO PUT STUFF ON THE LINE IF YOU HAVE OTHER CLIENTS THAT YOU'RE SERVING THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEED YOU NEED TO FIVE STAFFING FOR THAT -- FOR THE CLAIM FOR YOU YOU ALREADY SERVE A ROUNDER STAFFED -- YOU KNOW THIS IT'S NOT A FAKE INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE.

OF THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR A LOT OF WORKERS YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORKERS HERE -- WHO ARE WORKING FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT AGENCIES OF SOME WORKING OFTEN YOU HAVE A? WORKERS WHO WERE WORKING IN DAY PROGRAMS AND THEN THEY SPEND OUR EVENINGS WORKING DOING. SO LESS WORK TO MAKE ENDS MEET SO [INAUDIBLE] YES. SO YES -- IF YOU YOUTH YEAH PLEASE DO DO WHAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE OTHER ROOM. THREE ELIZABETH RATES HEARING OF THE CHILD WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SHE WAS REGIONAL SINGLE CLIENT INITIALLY -- WHEN SHE WAS AN ABOUT A YEAR OLD AND THEN SHE LEFT THE SYSTEM WHEN SHE WAS THREE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T QUALIFY SHE RE QUALIFIED AGAIN WHEN SHE WAS? FIVE ON WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE SAME SERVICE COORDINATOR. FOR I DON'T KNOW UNTIL SHE TURNED SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS BEING SWAYED. FOR MAN WHO. DIED A COUPLE YEARS BACK ON ONE OF THE THINGS -- THAT PIECE -- ABOUT THE SERVICE COORDINATION THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR US IS THAT LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE WE TRUST. SO KEEPING PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS AND KEEPING THIS THAT THE RATIOS DOWN IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- I HAVE WORKED IN A COUPLE AGENCIES MYSELF AS YOU KNOW I KIND OF REINVENTED MYSELF THROUGH THE YEARS AS A PARENT -- OF CHILD WITH DISABILITIES WHATEVER KIND OF WHAT NEEDS WERE HERS AT THAT TIME I KIND OF REINVENTED MYSELF. I'VE WORKED WITH AGENCIES AND I ALSO -- SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT PAY. AND BENEFITS -- THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- THE OTHER PIECE THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I FOUND I'M IN WORKING WITH SEVERAL AGENCIES IS -- THERE'S REALLY NOT A IN AN OVERALL QUALITY ASSURANCE -- FOR AGENCIES IN THE DIDN'T ARISE SYSTEM THERE'S THE SERVER THE THE ESSAY ARE A SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTS THAT GO THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER AND UP THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. BUT THERE'S NO OVERALL QUALITY CONTROL -- THE YOU DO HAVE THE STATE COUNCIL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO IS DOING SOME WORK IN THAT NOW -- BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK QUALITY CONTROL AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WITH AND SELF DETERMINATION COMING IN. TO PLAY IS THAT WE'RE EVEN GOING TO HAVE LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SOME OF THOSE SERVICES SO I WANT DOT COM. TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT -- SO ANYWAY THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT I FELT REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THANK YOU SHE SHARING THAT WITH US. GREETINGS AGAIN I'M KIM NASH I DID WANT TO BRING UP ONE MORE I'M VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES AROUND SUSPECTED ABUSE. WHETHER IT'S FINANCIAL NEGLECT SEXUAL OR PHYSICAL. AND ASK -- FOR THE NEW SOLUTIONS OR SOME WAY THAT WE CAN SEE GREATER RESPONSE FROM PROTECTIVE SERVICES FROM OUR POLICE AGENCIES TO DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN THERE ARE OUR FINDINGS TO TO PROSECUTE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE FREQUENTLY DO YOU SEE AND MAKE REFERRALS FOR PROTECTIVE SERVICES -- AND SOMETIMES THOSE CASES ARE QUITE OVER. OF THE ABUSE WE'VE SEEN. HOWEVER THERE IS A PROSECUTION THERE IS A FOLLOW UP AND THEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO BACK INTO THE SERVICE SYSTEM. WELL WE CAN WATCH FOR OUR SERVICES. WE CAN'T WATCH FOR ALL DEPENDENT SERVICES. AND IT CONCERNS ME BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT DO GET REFERRALS FOR SUSPECTED ABUSE. THAT AREN'T GETTING THE FOLLOW UP AND ARE GETTING THE INTERVIEWS AND THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ARE OFTEN SEEN AS POOR REPORTERS WHEN IN FACT THEY'RE NOT POOR REPORTERS THEY JUST MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY THEY VERBALIZE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I WANTED TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. THAT CONCERNS ALL OF US WHO ARE HERE IN THE SYSTEM. EVERY DAY SOME THANK YOU JUST MEASURE WITH THE LEGISLATION JUST ON THAT TOPIC THANK YOU I'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MERRY BLOCK ON BOTH THE RESIDENTS OF HUMBLE COUNTY. AND I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF CLIENT SERVICES WITH RED BRICK COAST REGIONAL CENTER.

ABOUT OVERSIGHT WE HEARD ABOUT COLLABORATION IN THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR OUR PARTNERS. BUT I WANT -- TO ADVOCATE FOR TWO IS THE OPERATIONAL FUNDING FOR REGIONAL CENTERS IT'S BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN THE FUNDING. THAT WE'RE OF RESTRICTED IN TERMS OF HIRING -- ADDITIONAL STAFF WE'VE HEARD SOME. INDIVIDUALS TALK ABOUT. THE THE YOUNG BEING IN THE MAIN PERSON CARING SEVEN TYPES OF EXPERTISE FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER. I ADVOCATE FOR SERVICE COORDINATION -- AND I ADVOCATE FOR OUR SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. BUT FOR SERVICE COORDINATION I'VE BEEN WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS WE BENT OVER OUR CASELOAD RATIOS. AND CURRENTLY -- WE'RE WELL WE'RE STILL UNDER THAT PLAN OF CORRECTION WE HAVEN'T FAILED TO MEET THAT AND WITHOUT HAVING REASONABLE HE SLOWLY -- WE CAN'T -- DO THE ADEQUATE JOB THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS TO BE PRESENT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO BE ASSESSABLE -- TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE HERE TO SERVE -- WE KNOW OUR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS REALLY LARGE WE HAVE A LOT OF WIND CHILL TIME -- FOR SERVICE COORDINATION THEY AT ALL TAKES AN IMPASSE -- RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A HIRING FREEZE SO WE HAVE POSITIONS WE HAVE SERVICE COORDINATORS WHO ARE CARING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CASES. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ALL TOUGH FEEL -- BACK FEEL POSITIONS BECAUSE OF OUR OPERATIONS BUDGET.

LIFETIME HUMBLE COUNTY RESIDENT AND IN HERE REALLY AS AN INTERESTED CITIZEN [INAUDIBLE] BECAUSE I I HAVE BEEN ATTACHED TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS AND IN DIFFERENT ROLES THAT I'VE HAD. I JUST FOUND. IT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGENCIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES AND ARE PROVIDING WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ALL DAY. SOME WONDERFUL SERVICES. HOWEVER TENUOUS THEY ARE. AND MANY ARE NEEDING MORE MONEY. FOR CONTINUING THEIR SERVICES. I'M AN BEFORE US WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE MONEY GOING AWAY. AND THAT MEANS THAT THESE CITIZENS WHO ARE SO WELL DESERVED. TO HAVE. THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE THE LIFE THAT THEY WANT TO LEAVE. COULD BE. ALL THAT COULD BE DISAPPEARING FOR THEM. IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK WE'LL SERIOUSLY ABOUT. HOW WE ARE AS COMMUNITY HAS? I THINK WAS DOCTOR SMALLEY SAID THAT FIGURES OUT WHAT HAS TO BE DONE -- THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL DOESN'T FIT INTO THAT MODEL THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] CLOSE. WITH YOUR PERMISSION.

WHEN ONCE TRUSTED CARE GIVER TRIED TO SEDUCE MY EXTREMELY NAIVE SON [INAUDIBLE] HE WITH FOUR DIFFERENT VISUAL AND VERBAL SEXUAL SKILLS DURING THE OVERNIGHT SHIFT IN MY SON'S ON HOME. THEN HE TOLD MY SON IF YOU TOLD ANYONE ABOUT IT I WILL HURT YOU.

BACKED UP THE CRIMINAL IN TERMINATED SERVICE TO MY SON WELL BY A LADY NUMEROUS REGIONAL CENTER REGULATIONS. THEN OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FELL DOWN ON THE JOB GIVING US THE SAME ROUTINE EXCUSES THEY TYPICALLY GIVE RAPE VICTIMS AND PROJECTS THANK YOU SEC WORRY I SOON LEARNED.

US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE STATISTICS SHOW THE ASSAULT RATE ON THE DISABLED IS OVER THREE TIMES THAT. OF THOSE ON THE NON DISABLED. DOCTOR BLOOMBERG SAYS IT'S ROUGHLY SEVEN TO TEN TIMES HIGHER. IN A TRAINER FOR CALIFORNIA MENTORS BUT STATISTICS THAT DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABUSE. THIS COMMITTEE IS IN PART CASPER'S REACHING OUT TO CALIFORNIA'S ID DE COMMUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THE DISABILITIES FACE. AND WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO BETTER SERVE THEM. THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS TO DO THIS OUR TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOUGH NEARLY ALL CARE GIVERS ARE DEDICATED CARING COMPETENT WILL. CHANGE THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF DEVELOPMENT ONLY AN INTELLECTUAL DISABLED CITIZENS IS NONETHELESS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM. ENSURE THAT ALL REGIONAL SOME PERSONNEL VENDORS AND VENDORS EMPLOYEES ARE THOROUGHLY TRAINED IN PREVENTING RECOGNIZING AND REPORTING NEGLECT ASSAULT AND ABUSE.

SOON THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE AND PARTICIPATING THIS HEARING TODAY. I LOVE MEETING ALL OF YOU. LIKE TO SAY GOODBYE TO ALL BY JUST SAYING THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TODAY. THE SYSTEM HAS INJURED FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF SUPPORT FROM THE STE THE PAST DECADE NASA OKAY WITH ME. GET THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ADD CONTINUES TO RISE. SO WE CONTINUE TO SERVICE PEOPLE MORE PEOPLE WITH LESS. AGAIN THAT'S NOT OKAY. OVER THE LAST DECADE AT AN AVERAGE INCREASE RATE OF OVER THREE POINT 7% ANNUALLY WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED NEW HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW CONSUMERS ENTERING INTO THE SYSTEM. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND ARE NOW BEING SERVICED AS WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE COMING IN. AND I LIKED. THE BOARD PRESIDENT'S COMMENT ABOUT WHAT WE DO BUT EACH YEAR. WE LIVE IN THE PAST. AND I TOOK THAT TO HEART SIR. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS? LIMITED AS THEY ARE TO THE SYSTEM TO MEET NEEDS. THIS IS THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY FIX [INAUDIBLE] TO OUR LONG. WE ALL THE SYSTEM [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. IN THIS MAY REVISE [INAUDIBLE] NOT DONE. WE STILL WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. ON A CONTINUAL BASIS AND THIS IS IT WAS ABOUT TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP. I'D LIKE TO I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SURVEY OF FAMILIES BEING SERVICED BY THE SYSTEM. FIND A LINK IN THIS TO THE SURVEY. ON THE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON A LENT INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. WEBSITE AND LOOK FOR THE LINK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AGENDA. WITH YOUR INPUT WE WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT YOU AND YOUR NEEDS. AND WE ARE ONLY STRONGER. TOGETHER. I AM PROUD OF YOUR COMMUNITY. OF HOW YOU BAND TOGETHER IT'S NOT. BEEN DONE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE A SAFE TRIP HOME TODAY. BUT I ALSO WANT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WHO I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE HIS. COLLEGIAL NATURE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HIS PASSION FOR HIS COMMUNITY. TO SAY A FEW WORDS IN THIS CLOSING. BUT WITH HIM WE WILL SUCCEED. WAS WAS WAS A THANK YOU TO EVERYTHING I I I WANTED JUST TAKE THROUGH SOME THINGS THAT I HEARD TODAY THAT -- SOME SURPRISE ME AND SOME DON'T BECAUSE I KNOW THE NATURE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. YEAH WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HIGH RATES OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS AND AND AND IT MAY BE MORE THAN TO ABIDE OF SOME MAYBE THREE OR FOUR DIAGNOSIS WITH SOME OF OUR CLIENTS AND AND THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THAT THAT FACES. WE ALSO HEARD THAT EARLY INTERVENTION WORKS AND WE ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT EARLY INTERVENTION -- IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AS WE HEAR OF PEOPLE COMING FOR TO TALK ABOUT THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE GET. THE RESOURCES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE I'M A DENNIS BY TRAINING THAT'S WHAT I DID FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AND I KNOW THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY CARE MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE. AND ONE OF MY CONTINUAL FRUSTRATIONS AT THE STATE IS WE DON'T INVEST IN PROGRAMS. LIKE WE SHOULD SO MANY TH SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR LINE ITEMS IN A BUDGET AND THAT EVERY YEAR. IF WE COULD INVEST IN AND ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD ON PROGRAMMING WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S DIABETES PREVENTION OR THE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND PEOPLE'S. OVERALL HEALTH -- THEIR OUTLOOK ON ON THE FUTURE WOULD BE MUCH MUCH DIFFERENT AND AND IS IT IS A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION TO ME THAT WE DON'T WORK THAT WAY. AND THAT WHY IT IS PARTICULARLY -- REWARDING TO BE WORKING WITH -- SOMEONE WHO SHARES THAT PASSION -- THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A HAVE A HAVE A PARTNER IN IN SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE -- ENDEAVORS AS WE GO FORWARD. WELL WHEN I I'M REALLY GRATIFIED FOR WAS IT HE GOT TO SEE THE AMAZING STRENGTH IN UNITY OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT IN A LOT OF AREAS AND AND IT IS -- PARTICULAR HEARTENING TO ME WHEN I COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THIS THIS MASSIVE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. THAT IT IS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF RURAL CALIFORNIA IS IT WE STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE. TO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE OUTSIDE RESOURCES BUT BY STICKING TOGETHER WE PROVIDE A QUALITY OF CARE FOR PEOPLE THAT IS DIFFERENT. AND BETTER I THINK THAN THAN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES SO -- WE HEARD ABOUT ASUS -- SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT HUMBLE COUNTY HAS A IT HAS THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE STATE IS NOT JUST THE HIGHEST RATE IT'S TWICE THE AVERAGE. WE NOW HAVE A SURGEON GENERAL APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME THAT WILL ADDRESS. SOME OF THAT SHE'S AN EXPERT IN ACES AND MICHAEL WAS TO GET HER UP. AND TO MEET WITH. FINALLY -- AND THE REASON I ASKED ABOUT AUTONOMY IN THE ABILITY FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE WAY THAT OUR BEST. IS THAT. ANOTHER FRUSTRATION IS THAT AT THE STATE WE DO A LOT OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL THINGS. AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK RURAL ALWAYS RULE IT IT'S COST LESS TO LIVE OUT THERE ARE ITS WHATEVER IT DOESN'T. THE DISTANCES THAT WE HAVE TO TRAVEL FOR SERVICES ARE MUCH GREATER IT'S NOT AS NOT ONLY IS A MUCH GREATER DISTANCE TAKES LONGER SOMETIMES -- HEALTH CARE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS 30% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT IS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND SO WITH HEIGHT WITH GREATER DISTANCES MORE FUEL CONSUMPTION ALSO PAY MORE FOR GASOLINE ME PAY MORE FOR A LOT OF THINGS. THAT CONCEPT THAT SOMEHOW WELL THERE RURAL COMMUNITY THEY DON'T NEED AS MUCH IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE WE ACTUALLY OFTEN NEED MORE. AND SO AS LONG AS I'M IN THIS IN THIS ROLE -- I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE HARD FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA -- BIG SHOES TO FILL WITH THE SENATOR CHESBRO AND PATTY BERG WHO'VE BEEN STAUNCH ADVOCATES HERE BUT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT AND AND AS WELL AND I WAS IS AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM THERE SO. I PARTICULARLY AM THRILLED TO SEE THE COP THE COLLABORATION AND THE AND AND A LOT FEWER SILOS HERE THAN WE SEE AND IN OTHER AREAS AND AND A FOCUS ON A WHOLE PERSON CARE. SIZE WAS A THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT TODAY AND SHARED WITH US -- YOUR STORIES YOUR CONCERNS AND AND AND SHARED WITH US WHAT'S GOING WELL AND IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR FOR ME AND AND AND THIS KIND OF COMMITTEE GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TAKE BACK WHAT'S WORKING WELL. LEARN FROM WHAT ISN'T WORKING WELL AND TRY TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR ALL OF US AS WELL THANK GOD ONCE AGAIN. A MISTER FRAZIER HIS STAFF ON THE CITY EVERYONE WHO HELPED US PUT THIS TOGETHER TODAY HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU TO DISAPPEAR. TODAY. WITH YOU WE'RE NOT EXPERTS. NOW YOU WHICH YES. CAN SHARE THE INFORMATION. THE TIME WITH US THAT WE CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU. AND MAKE. PEOPLE THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT THEIR LIVES BETTER
