00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.860
AND ONE. WERE ABOUT US QUICKER

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:51.429
NOW THAT'S ONE HUNDRED ONE TOO

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.296
MANY ADMITTED. THAT COLLECTORS

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:55.366
AT SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:58.002
COMPLAINTS. SEVEN THOUSAND SIX

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.236
HUNDRED. OVER THE LAST THREE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.438

COMPLAINTS ABOUT US EIGHTY FIVE

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.110
. MORE THAN 50% OF THOSE WE

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:09.180
REIMBURSED. SO EVERY TIME I HEAR

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.082
ABOUT ALL THESE COMPLAINTS BUT I

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.616
DON'T SEE THEM IT'S CONCERNING

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.719
TO ME. SECONDLY THIS IS

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.587
SUPPOSEDLY CONSUMER BILL. YES

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:17.888
BROUGHT BY DEBT COLLECTORS TO

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.824
MAKE AN ENTIRE LIVING. TAKING

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.226
PEOPLE TO COURT SEEKING DEFAULT

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.294
JUDGMENTS AND BLOWING UP THE

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.895
FUNDS TO COLLECT MONEY. NOT ONE

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.630
CONSUMER GROUP IF YOU'RE IN

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.599
FAVOR OF THIS BILL. AND WHEN

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.167
THEY SAY THE CONSUMER

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.303
FEDERATION. OF THAT SETTLEMENT

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:33.838
FOLKS THERE GIVEN THAT

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:35.606
SETTLEMENT AND THAT NONPROFIT IS

00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:37.341
USUALLY FUNDED BY CREDITORS. SO

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:39.844
THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.312
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.814
DO ASK THE MEMBERS OF THIS

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:44.348
COMMITTEE IF THE THIS BILL

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.617
PASSED. WITH THE FIGURES THAT I

CALIFORNIA'S BENEFIT FROM CREDIT

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:53.090
REPAIR SERVICES WOULD BE WORSE

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.258
MANY OF YOU ARE CHAMPIONS OF

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.493
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.828
OF CALIFORNIA IT'S A HUGE

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.764
PROBLEM IN THE STATE. CREDIT IS

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.265
A MAJOR PLAYER IN AFFORDABLE

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.000
HOUSING IN THE STATE. IF YOU

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.568
HAVE POOR CREDIT. YOU'RE LESS

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.770
LIKELY TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.872
WELL IF THERE'S NOBODY HERE TO

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.073

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.580
ELDERLY SHE BARELY SPEAKS

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.348
ENGLISH SHE WOULD EVEN KNOW

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.916
WHERE TO START THE FEDERAL

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.451

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.293
STAND BETWEEN THAT COLLECTIVE TO

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.428
CONSUMERS WITH THE LAST LINE OF

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.130
DEFENSE. AND THEY WANT TO HAVE I

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.132

THAT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WILL

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:41.818

ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT I

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.988
THINK THE HEART OF WHAT THERE IS

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.923
I MEAN IF I THOUGHT THERE WERE

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.592
TWO ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:49.159
WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ONE

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:50.294
COMMITTEE IS ADDRESSED IN THEIR

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.161
AMENDMENTS FOCUSED ON THE BURDEN

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:53.664
OF PROOF AND THE SECOND REMAINS

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.331
THIS QUESTIONABLE LETTERS RIGHT.

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.433
AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.768
WAS LEFT WITH IS. THE PEOPLE

00:48:57.834 --> 00:48:58.902
THAT I THINK EVERYONE SITTING

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.604
HERE ON THIS DIRE S. INCLUDING

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.105
YOU CARES ABOUT OTHER CONSUMERS.

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.140
RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.374
CONSUMERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:07.177
FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND YOU KNOW

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.679
WE'RE WE'RE STUCK BETWEEN TWO

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.047
INDUSTRIES BOTH OF WHICH HAVE

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.348
BAD ACTORS AND- RIGHT AND SO I

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.550
THINK. I JUST WANT TO CENTER

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:14.184
CONVERSATIONS ON THE CONSUMERS

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.986
AND DOING WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM.

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:17.854
AND AS I LOOKED AT THIS QUESTION

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.022
OF YOU KNOW TAKING AWAY THE

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.924
ABILITY OF THESE SERVICERS TO

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.826
SEND COMMUNICATIONS. ON BEHALF

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.895
OF THEIR CLIENTS IS AN ATTORNEY.

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:25.829
WHEN WE CLEAR ATTORNEYS AS YOU

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:26.997
SAW THE CONSUMER JOURNEYS WILL.

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:29.733
DO IT ALL THE TIME I MEAN THAT

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.901
IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:31.601
REPRESENTS ONE OF THEIR BEHALF

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.470
RIGHT AND I INDICATED THAT I WAS

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:34.838
THE ATTORNEYS IN THOSE LETTERS

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.173
BUT- WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.474
SOMEONE YOU HAVE THAT POWER OF

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:39.076
ATTORNEY TO DO IT YOU CAN WRITE.

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:41.445
ON THEIR BEHALF AS THEY DO AND

00:49:41.511 --> 00:49:42.713
WE'RE TAKING THAT ABILITY AWAY

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:43.280
AS- THE- ANALYSIS CLEARLY

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.015
INDICATED UNDER FEDERAL LAW IT

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:45.549
WOULD THEN STOP THE DEBT

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:46.917
COLLECTORS FROM HAVING TO

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:48.085
RESPOND. IN THE SAME WAY AS IF

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:50.420
IT'S WRITTEN FROM THE CONSUMER.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.621
SO THAT PEACE DOES NOT FEEL

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:53.490
LIKE. THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THE

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.225
CONSUMER AND I GUESS I WOULD

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.426
LIKE THE SPONSORS TO EXPLAIN

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:59.029
WHAT THEY SEE THE BENEFIT TO

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.063
CONSUMERS MAX THAT'S NOT A

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.365
TRANSPARENCY ISSUE. STILL

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:02.332
PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.134
WHEN I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.502
ABOUT HERE IS. IN ULTIMATELY

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:09.139
THIS- WHETHER OR NOT THE DEBT

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:10.474
COLLECTORS ARE OBLIGATED UNDER

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.943
CURRENT FEDERAL LAW TO RESPOND

00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:14.711
TO IT A CONSUMER DISPUTE AND

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.947
VALIDATE THAT DEBT- THIS ISSUE

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:19.282
CAME UP WE ACTUALLY DID ENTER AN

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.351
AMENDMENT INTO OUR BILL THAT

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:23.019
REQUIRES ALL DEBT COLLECTORS.

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:24.654
I'M NOT REGARDLESS OF THE SENDER

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:27.491
WE HAVE TO NOW RESPONDS TO EACH

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:29.226
AND EVERYONE OF THOSE DISPUTES.

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:30.994
OKAY SO- WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.163
LAW OR STATE LAW THE STATE LAW

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.132
NOW IS ENTERED INTO TWO FOUR TWO

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.801
FOUR- WHICH REQUIRES ALL OF US

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.269
TO RESPOND WHETHER IT'S

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.104
DISCLOSES THAT ITS PROMISE YES

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.139
SO OR WHETHER IT'S FROM AN

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.908
ATTORNEY OR WHETHER IT'S FROM

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:45.976
THE DEBTOR THEMSELVES. AND I

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:48.412
DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:49.045
NO BECAUSE I ASKED WITH A

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:50.914
BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER AS OF

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:52.149
THEM IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AND

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.417
I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:54.184
OKAY. SO THE OTHER BENEFIT TO

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:56.453
THAT IS IF RIGHT NOW THE- IF THE

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.755
LETTER IS COMING DIRECTLY FROM

00:50:58.822 --> 00:50:59.556
THE CONSUMER OR- THE CONTRACT

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:01.992
WITH THIS YES SO. WE DO NOT KNOW

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:04.361
THAT THE- THE CSO IS THAT

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:05.762
DISPUTE VALIDATION IS GOING

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.731
DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER THE CSO

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:11.435
HAS NO IDEA THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.736
VALIDATED AND PROVIDED PROOF. TO

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.838
THE CONSUMER. VALIDATING THAT

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.740
ACCOUNT. SO THEN THEY CONTINUE

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.742
TO GET CHARGE FROM THE CSM. IT'S

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.644
LIKE THIS PERPETUAL LOOP. THAT

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.346
IS NOT CLOSED AND SO THEY

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:25.348
CONTINUE TO GET CHARGED BY THE

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:27.050
CSO. SO OKAY SO WHAT I'M HEARING

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.385
FROM THE COLLECTORS IS THAT THE

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.253
BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD SAVE

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.154
THE CONSUMER MONEY BECAUSE OF

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.089
THE LETTER WENT DIRECTLY TO THE

00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.491
SERVICING ORGANIZATION. THEN

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.593
THAT CHARGES WOULD STOCK IT

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.628
CLOSES THAT LOOP IF THE DATA IS

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:40.697
VALID AND WE PROVIDE THE PROOF

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.265

DISPUTED COUNTING YOUR CREDIT

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.272
OKAY THAT CLOSES THE LOOP IT'S

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:51.975
NOT IT'S A VALID ACCOUNT CANNOT

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.510
BE REMOVED- IF IT'S PAID THEN

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.479
IT'S SHOWING AS PAID BUT

THAT FEDERAL LAW TRUMPS. STATE

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:22.138
LAW ON THIS ISSUE EVEN THE

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:23.273
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.143
THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE

ANNOUNCES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:30.947
WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:33.049
CSOS TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. TO

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:34.518
DENY THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH TRUMP

HERE IS JUST A MISAPPLICATION

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:38.555
AND MISINTERPRETATION OF THE

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.290
LAW. IF WE HAVE TO MARK OUR

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.025
LETTERS. THEY CAN SIMPLY IGNORE

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.693
THE LETTERS. THERE'S BEEN TWO

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.161
FEDERAL LAWSUITS WITHIN THE LAST

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:46.296
YEAR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TENTH

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:47.597
CIRCUIT WOULD AFFECT ELECTORS

CASES. SO THIS IS FOR- SHOPPING

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:55.405
THIS IS FINDING A STATE THEY'LL

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:57.207
DO WHAT THE COURT WILL DO.

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.108
THEY'RE ASKING THIS LEGISLATIVE

OKAY SO YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.085
QUESTION HERE SO. THAT WOULD BE

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:10.220
EVEN MORE I'M HAPPY TO THE WHY

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:12.088
QUESTION WAS IF THE LETTER WERE

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:14.391
TO GO TO YOU INSTEAD OF THE

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:15.258
CONSUMER AS THE SPONSORS HAVE

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.826
INDICATED WITH THAT CLOSE THE

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.528
LOOP AND THE CHARGES FOR THE

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.863
CONSUMER THAT'S THE BENEFIT

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.064
THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME BY

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:23.533
THE SPONSORS ONCE. ONCE THE DATA

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.467
HAS BEEN VALIDATED ON SOMEONE'S

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.202
CREDIT REPORT THAT THE CONSUMER

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.604
THAN THE RELATIONSHIP CEASES

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.406
WITH US IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:31.575
SEMANTICS FOR THE LETTER GOES TO

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:33.143
THEM THEY TELL US OR WE GET THE

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:34.644
LETTER IT'S- SO HOW OFTEN DO

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.212
CONSUMERS AND I YOU MAY NOT KNOW

TO GIVE. A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.118
HERE BUT I GUESS SO I'M AS THE

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.787
AUTHOR SAID YOU KNOW I AM A-

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.022
BUSY PERSON WHO CHECKED MY MAIL

IN THE MAIL BY MY DOOR MAY PILE

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.293
UP EDUCATION. I THINK MANY OF US

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.595
IN THIS ROOM EXPERIENCE WHEN

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:54.230

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:56.333
LETTERS BACK. VALIDATED IT AND

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.801
NOW THE RELATIONSHIP ISN'T

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:58.935
CEASING TO EXIST BECAUSE IT'S

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.337
SITTING IN MY PILE BY THE DOOR

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.138
AND YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:04.207
SO I THAT I THINK SHE HAS

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:05.709
ACTUALLY INDICATED A SITUATION

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:06.977

TO PAY MORE I MEAN YOU HAVE. A

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.213
RESPONSE TO THAT SO THE SCENARIO

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.215
WOULD BE THAT THE LETTER WOULD

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.050
COME TO US AND THEN WE WOULD

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:17.287
KNOW IT'S VALIDATED SO WE WOULD

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.055
BE ABLE TO STOP THE RELEASE YES.

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:21.191

SUBSCRIPTION PAID TO BEGIN WITH.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.096
I MEAN I THINK WITH THE ONE THE

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:27.998
BABY OUT WITH THE WATER- WE- WE

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:30.033
DON'T DO THAT. I MEAN SUPPORT AS

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.368
A NONPROFIT- IF THEY GET THE

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.636
LETTER THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.671
A CHARGE THE NEXT MONTH SO. I

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:35.305
MEAN. IT HURTS IT HURTS

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:37.140
EVERYBODY SOLD IN A PERSON HURTS

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.308
THE MOST IS GOING TO BE

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.276
CONSUMER. GOT IT I MEAN IS THERE

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:42.479
A WAY I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIND

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:43.947
A HAPPY MEDIUM BECAUSE I SEE THE

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.949
BENEFIT THE CONSUMER. IS CLEARED

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.784
TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THE PASTOR

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:48.418
SENDING THESE LETTERS ON THEIR

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:49.119
BEHALF THIS IS A MORASS AS

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:51.054
ACTUALLY. BEING ALICE'S

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:51.721
INDICATED. THIS IS COMPLICATED.

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:52.522
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CANNOT DO

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.691
THIS ON THEIR OWN AND SO THE

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.292
IDEA THAT. WE'RE SAYING THAT YOU

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.527
CAN'T DO THIS ON THEIR BEHALF-

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.162
IF YOU DO IT ON THEIR BEHALF

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:01.264
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET THE SAME

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:01.898
LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS DOESN'T

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.433
FEEL RIGHT TO ME. BUT I DO

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.334
UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THAT WE

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.302
WANT YOU TO HAVE THE INFORMATION

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.303
THAT'S BEEN VALIDATED IF THAT.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.472
ENDS THE CYCLE OF PAYING FOR THE

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.041
CONSUMER. SO IS THERE A WAY TO

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.942
DO BOTH IS THERE A WAY TO ENSURE

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:15.612
IT. I MEAN I GUESS IF YOU'RE NOT

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:16.246
LISTED THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE-

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:18.815
COLLECTORS TO KNOW TO SEND IT TO

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:19.516
YOU. RIGHT WHICH WAS THE

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.851
ARGUMENT MADE BY THE SPONSORS-

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:23.186
SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:23.753
SOLUTION HERE IS BUT I THINK

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.221
THAT- THIS PIECE OF THE BILL

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:30.927
FEELS LIKE ADS WRITTEN. NEED IT

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.195
TO BE RIGHT WE'RE SEIZING ALL

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:33.363
COMMUNICATIONS THAT WOULD

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.931
ADEQUATELY GET A RESPONSE WHICH

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.167
I DON'T THINK IS IN THE BEST

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.835
INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER AS THE

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:39.936
PASTOR IS SAYING- BUT WE ALSO

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.171
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:42.672
ONCE IT'S VALIDATED THEY'RE NO

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:43.306
LONGER PAYING BECAUSE THE

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.875
SERVICE IS. DONE SO I THINK YOU

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.644
KNOW I TRUST THE AUTHOR AND I

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.179
THINK WE CAN GET TO A PLACE

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:51.314
WHERE WE'RE DOING BOTH OF THOSE

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.482
THINGS AND PROTECTING AND REALLY

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:53.683
AGAIN CENTRING THE CONSUMER AND

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.552
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:56.653
WE CARE MOST ABOUT. BUT IT IS

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.021
CRITICAL TO ME THAT THOSE

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.656
LETTERS CONTINUE TO BE RESPONDED

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.458
TO AND SENT BY THE PEOPLE WHO

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.826
UNDERSTAND THIS SYSTEM. BECAUSE

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.427
IT'S NOT THE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.895
THE DEBT. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.731
SO- YOU KNOW I'LL BE SUPPORTING

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.199
IT TODAY BUT I REALLY HOPE WE

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.834
CAN WORK TO GET THAT PASSED.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.202
ABSOLUTELY AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:14.270
THE TO THE YOU KNOW TO YOUR

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:15.905
POINT IS OUR GOAL IS TO- PROTECT

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.575
THE CONSUMER AND IT YOU KNOW TO

00:56:18.641 --> 00:56:20.210
THE PASTOR'S POINT THERE'S SO

WANT TO STOP THEM FROM BEING

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:28.051
ABLE TO BE HELPED BY THE SAME

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.252

DOLLARS AND THAT THIS FEE WILL

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.125

RICK. FOR THE CSOS GOOD REGISTER

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.885
PROCESS AND THAT FEE TO REGISTER

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.220
IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT'S

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.889
CURRENTLY THE OVERSIGHT FOR THAT

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:40.657
CURRENTLY LIES WITH THE ATTORNEY

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:43.626
GENERAL- AND SO REALLY WHAT THIS

00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:45.361
IS LOOKING TO DO NOW IS SHIFT

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.597
THAT OVER. INTO THE DEPARTMENT

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:49.566

THAT IS THE DEPARTMENT NOW THAT

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:54.370
IS THE WATCHDOG FOR CONSUMERS SO

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.406
THE BILL AS PROPOSED THERE IS NO

AS WHICH IS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:04.080
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO THERE

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:07.350
IS NO INCREASE THE DF PI AS THEY

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:08.151

LICENSING IF THEY DEEM IT DOWN

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.122
THE ROAD THEY MAY RESERVE THE

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:14.023
RIGHT. TO INCREASE THEIR

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.959
REGISTRATION FEES DOWN THE ROAD

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:18.161

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:20.029
THE BILL AS DRAFTED I'M SORRY

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:24.067

CHOOSE WHAT SORT. DOES THE POINT

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:38.214
UP PERIODICALLY KNOW PERIODICAL

NOT A LICENSING- IT SO THERE IS

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.160

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WE HAVE

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.788
A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.123
INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS THE

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.457

HASN'T BEEN ANY ISSUES WITH THE

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.707
REMOTE ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:14.043
FIVE YEAR EXTENSION IS TO SEE IF

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.178

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.279

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:18.981
DIFFERENCE AND GREATER

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.649

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.517
OUR NON INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:25.287
ARE SENIORS THEY INVEST FOR THE

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.957
DIVIDENDS- AND DON'T PARTICIPATE

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.558
ALL THAT FREQUENTLY IN THE YEAH

CONTACT IS AT THE FRONT

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.364
ENVIRONMENT THE HOWEVER. IN A

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.665
SERIES OF BUSINESSES-

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.968
INTERRUPTIONS QUESTIONS CAN BE

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.470
RAISED EVEN PHONE WAS ON MEETING

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:44.607

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.146
GOVERNMENT HAS TO. GET INTO THE

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.482
IS AND THE GULF ON. HOW THE

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.350
GOING TO THE MEAT SHOULD BE

CONSULTANT COMPARTE CORRECTLY

01:10:58.787 --> 01:10:59.888

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.591
THE MID SEVENTIES FOR IN PERSON.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.693

BACKGROUND. INDUCTOR COMING OUT

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.102

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.571
GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OF THE

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:16.171

NEEDED FIRST STEP WHILE COVERED

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.866
NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.268
CAUSE- THE BECAUSE A LOT OF

UNCERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES RIGHT

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:22.805
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I DO

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:25.307

SOMETHING- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.715
VALUE BY HAVING THESE MEETINGS

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.017
BE FULLY REMOTE ON A ON A

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.219
PERMANENT BASIS AND AFTER ALL-

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.821
COMMUNICATION DEBATE WORKS

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:41.824
DIFFERENTLY IN PERSON- THE BATES

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.125
YOUR- THEY SAY THAT

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.693
COMMUNICATION 70% OF ALL

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.528
COMMUNICATION IS NONVERBAL. AND

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.698
SO- I APPRECIATE THE ALL THE

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.100
DIFFERENT PLATFORMS WE HAVE OUT

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.569
THERE TO GO VIRTUAL BUT I ALSO

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.937
UNDERSTAND I BELIEVE- THE

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.072
SIGNIFICANT VALUE OF IN PERSON

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.274

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.442

SHAREHOLDERS AND THE

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.446
CORPORATIONS WELL I DO THINK

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.881
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW THE
