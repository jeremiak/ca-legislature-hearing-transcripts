SEE IT THREE ISSUES FIRST.

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:06.416
PUTTING GUARDRAILS AROUND

GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES THAT

ARE TOO OFTEN USED TO SHED BAD

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:13.490
ACTORS FROM LIABILITY SECOND.

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:14.691
CREATES A PROCESS FOR

AUTHOR MENTIONED TO HAVE BROKEN

THE LAW LIMITS DEMONSTRATED

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.232
THAT UNFIT FOR SERVICE NOT ONLY

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:22.766
IN THEIR OWN CURRENT

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.467

I'VE HAD WITH MEMBERS THIS IS

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.274
AN AREA IS BOTH THE AUTHOR AND

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:33.743
THE PRO TEM MENTION STILL NEEDS

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.712
WORK. AND CERTAINLY YOU HEARD

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.881
THE AUTHOR A COMMIT TO THAT AS

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:39.082
HE DID WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.750
HUNDREDS OF HOURS HE PUT INTO

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:43.820
THIS MAJOR HERE THAT'S BEFORE

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.088
US ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. THIRD

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.190
AND FINALLY. WHICH IS REALLY

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.192
THE CORE OF THE SUBJECT OF THE

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.094
DISCUSSION- JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.763
ON THE CHANGES BEING BEING MADE

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.865
TO THE BANE ACT NAMED AFTER MY

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.634
DEAR FRIEND TOM BAIN WHO SERVE

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.369
THE COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:00.971
VALLEY THAT I CURRENTLY SERVE.

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.472
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:03.773
BAND ACT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.042
DESIGNED FOR HATE CRIMES. IT'S

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.577
BEEN EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.946
AND THE AUTHOR. AMENDS THIS IS

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:12.916
A RESULT OF- THE DISCUSSONS

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.818
THAT WE'VE HAD TO REALLY FOCUS

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.453
ON WHERE OFFICERS ARE REALLY

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.954
BAD ACTORS WHERE THERE'S BARELY

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.956
BEEN A STANDARD WHERE THEY'VE

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:21.524
BEEN PROVEN TO BE BAD ACTORS

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:22.592
AND NOT TO HAVE A CHILLING

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:25.629
EFFECT. ON GOOD POLICE OFFICERS

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.963
ARE NOT TO HAVE A HORRIBLE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.765
IMPACT ON THE CITIES AND

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.266
COUNTIES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.768
THEIR TREASURIES TO BE IMPACTED

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.603
THAT REGARDS. BY SETTING A

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.839
STANDARD THAT ONLY ISN'T OVER

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.574
BROAD AND THAT ONLY DEALS WITH

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.743
THOSE THAT REALLY DESERVE TO BE

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:42.245
SUBJECT TO. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:44.214
VIOLATIONS OF COURSE THIS

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.182
EXTENDS IN WRONGFUL DEATH CASES

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:48.151
EXTENDS THESE ACTIONS TO STATE

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.452
COURTS WAS DRAMATICALLY

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.655
IMPORTANT TO THE LEGAL BAR. AND

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.323

WHICH ARE TREMENDOUS INCENTIVES

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.562
BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:03.166
ENGAGE IN APPROPRIATE CONDUCT.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:07.604

COLLECTION BUT DOES NOT GO AS

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.899
FAR AS TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.567
AS THIS MEASURE DOES AND DOES

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.335

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:54.010
OFFICERS ARE QUALIFIED- AND

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:54.577
THAT'S IT AND IF THEY HAVE

00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:57.313
CONFIDENCE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.283
ARE POLICING ON OUR- DON'T HAVE

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.851
A TRACK RECORD OF ABUSING

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:04.788
PEOPLE IT SEEMS SO BASIC RIGHT

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.589
WE EXPECTED OF EVERY OTHER

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:07.423
PROFESSION THAT IF YOU GO AND

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.492
HIRE A LAWYER. OR YOU GO TO SEE

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.828
A DOCTOR- OR AS THE AUTHORS

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:14.397
STATED YOU GO TO GET A HAIR CUT

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:16.566
THAT THAT PERSON IS IN GOOD

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:20.069
STANDING AND HAS NOT ENGAGED

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.205
AND AGREED JUST BEHAVIOR THAT

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.374
WOULD MAKE YOU NOT WANT TO GO

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.875
TO THAT PERSON. I KNOW

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.610
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.812
STATES IN THIS COUNTRY IT'S

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.547
ACTUALLY EMBARRASSING THAT WE

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:32.649
HAVE CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:34.417
STATES THAT HAVE THE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.519
CERTIFICATION PROCESS SEES FOR

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:37.954
POLICE OFFICERS WHO SHOULD NOT

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:42.492
BE POLICE OFFICERS. I KNOW HERE

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:43.026
IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T. AN

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:43.827
OFFICE CAN REACH IN THE MIDDLE

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.295
OF AN INVESTIGATION AND GO GET

00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:47.764
HIRED SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT IS

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.366
EXACTLY HOW YOU UNDERMINE

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:52.702
CONFIDENCE IN POLICING. THAT'S

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.003
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED TO

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.538
BE DOING SO THIS IS LONG

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:57.707
OVERDUE. AN INCREDIBLY

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.776
IMPORTANT FORWARD LOOKING

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:03.012
REFORMS. TO IMPROVE POLICING.

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.781
AND TO INCREASE COMMUNITY TRUST

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.649
IN POLICING IN THE STATE OF

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.518
CALIFORNIA. I ALSO JUST WANT TO

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:09.586
KNOW WHAT I TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.654
COMMITTEE I AM. ONE OF THE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:12.722
MEMBERS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.624
MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE-

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:15.592
THERE ARE A FEW OF US WHO

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:17.460
ACTUALLY LITIGATED- HAS

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.596
LITIGATED THE BAN ACT. AND AS I

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:21.497
SAID IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:23.399
THE BAN ACT- I THINK I USE THE

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:25.635
PHRASE IS A HOT MESS AND THANK

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.303

THIS IS A MASS OF A STATUTE- IT

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:36.646
DOESN'T SERVE ANYONE WELL- AND

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:39.315
SO THE CHANGES. THAT ARE WITH

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.683
THAT WE HOPEFULLY WILL BE

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:44.187
PASSING TODAY WELL NOT PERFECT.

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:45.688

RECOVER DAMAGES WHEN THEY HAVE

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.328
BEEN. TERRIBLY WRONG SO

ATTORNEYS IN THIS ROOM. IF YOU

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.640
SAW A JURY MADE UP WITH THREE

NOW IS WHAT NO I I'VE STAYED UP

AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.691
PARTICULARLY. GIVEN THAT IT

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.560

SIGNIFICANT AND WRONG. I TOO

WE'VE ALL HEARD. WHEN OUR

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.474
COLLEAGUES FROM GARDENA STOOD

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:21.277
UP AND PRESENTED THIS BILL WE

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.878
ALL HEARD THE PASSION. AND THE

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:27.583
FEAR. IN HIS VOICE. AND THAT

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.286
PASSION AND FEAR IS ROOTED IN

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.355
HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:34.857
THAT EXPERIENCE WHILE SOME OF

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.992
US AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.628
WHO WERE BORN WHITE. HAVE NOT

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:42.665
HAD TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT NOT

HAD TO GO THROUGH OUR DAILY

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.936
BUSINESS WITHOUT FEAR. IT IS

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:51.107
NOT ONE THAT WE CAN OR SHOULD

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.142
DISCOUNT IN ANY WAY. AND SO

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.845
WHILE SOME OF US MAY FEEL THAT

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:58.347
WELL YOU KNOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.549
EXTREMES ARE WE TRYING TO

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:01.584
CORRECT FOR SOMETHING THAT MAY

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.954
NOT BE. SO SIGNIFICANT.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.423
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS SIGNIFICANT

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.792
AND IS A SIGNIFICANT ON ONLY A

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.661
SMALL PERCENT WERE NOT A SMALL

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:15.664
BUT RATHER A SEGMENT. OF OUR

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.633
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. MY

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.635
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND MYSELF

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.471
WE DO NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:25.207
THAT FEAR YES WE MAY ENCOUNTER

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:28.010
A DIFFICULT. EXPERIENCE WITH A

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.379
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BUT IN

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.982
THAT DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE WE

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.084
ARE NOT WORRYING ABOUT. BEING

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:39.388
KILLED. SO THAT BUT THE OTHER

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.957
REALITY THE OTHER REALITY IS

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.893
THAT IT IS A SMALL PERCENT OF

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:49.365
OFFICERS WHO. VIOLATE TEACHERS

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.467
BREAK THE LAW OR EVEN PULL

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.636
THEIR WEAPONS ARE SOMETIMES AN

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.271
OFFICER HAS TO PULL A WEAPON

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:58.307
FOR VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.109
IT IS STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:03.112
AND WHAT THIS BILL. IS REALLY

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.448
GIVING US THE TOOLS TO DO. IS

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:07.249
TO BE ABLE AS OTHER COLLEAGUES

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:10.786
HAVE TALKED ABOUT. TO BE ABLE

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:14.623
TO ROOT OUT. THOSE OFFICERS

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.993
THAT HAVE A PROVEN. HISTORY OF

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.630
VIOLATING THE LAW. VIOLATING

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:25.835
PROCEDURES. FOR TAKING PEOPLE'S

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:29.839
LIVES AND VERY UNFORTUNATELY AS

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.106
CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.175
COMMITTEE FOR THE PREVIOUS FOUR

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.110
YEARS AND WHILE WE HAD MANY

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.812
BILLS AROUND THESE TYPES OF

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.782
SUBJECT AREAS. I HEARD HOURS OF

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.918
TESTIMONY FROM FAMILIES WHO

01:08:42.985 --> 01:08:44.987
LOST LOVED ONES TO OFFICERS AND

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.956
ONCE THEY FINALLY WERE ABLE TO

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:49.158
GET RECORDS WHICH WE AS YOU

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.494
RECALL CALIFORNIA HAD A FORTY

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.462
YEAR BAN ON ANY PUBLIC RECORDS

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.498
SO WE COULD NOT FIND OUT.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.867
WHETHER AN OFFICER HAD A PAST

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.837
HISTORY. OF HAVING- PULL THE

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.473
WEAPON OR READ VIOLENCE

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.442
AGAINST- A NUMBER OF

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.043
INDIVIDUALS BUT ONCE THOSE

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:09.144
FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO GET THE

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:11.046
RECORDS THEY FOUND IN MANY

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.616
CASES NOT ALL THAT THE OFFICER

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:16.085
HAD A HISTORY OF THAT CONDUCT

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:18.287
THAT IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.122
DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THAT

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.425

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.737
DECERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.674
BE USED WIDELY AND IT WILL NOT

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.175
BE USED WIDELY BECAUSE THERE IS

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:43.579

GETTING INTO THIS PLACE SO FAR.

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.666
AND I DO JUST WANT TO. SAY THAT

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.034
I AM STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.402
MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.738
ORANGE COUNTY CENTER- WHO WHO

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:17.673
SPOKE ABOUT. THE MAKEUP OF THE

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.841
BOARD I DO THINK IN THE END OF

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.809
THE DAY ON THIS WE NEED TO

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.845

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.980
GIVING THIS BOARD. A QUASI

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.515
JUDICIAL POWERS I UNDERSTAND

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.416
THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.351
TRY TO DIMINISH. THE POWERS BUT

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.453
IF YOU GO INTO THE- LANGUAGE OF

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.555
THE BILL AT THE- THE DECISIONS

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.891
OF THIS BOARD- REALLY ARE.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.526
GOING TO BE VERY INFLUENTIAL AS

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:38.627
TO THE FINAL DECISION MAKING

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:41.263

THAT WE HAVE IT WRITTEN RIGHT

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.337
NOW. IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.506
SKEW. TOWARD FOLKS ARE GONNA BE

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:53.242
PRETTY SKEPTICAL OF- A POLICE

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:55.210
AND I KNOW THAT THE DEBATE.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.612
THERE IS A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.646
REPRESENT THE POLICE WANTED TO

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:58.947
BE HALF POLICE AND HALF NOT

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.249
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M INTERESTED

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:01.850

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:04.453
AKIN TO. THE SORTS OF BOARDS

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.054

TO TREAT THESE ISSUES FAIRLY-

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.002
AND I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.137
BALANCE TO STRIKE. AND I FEEL

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.406

WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A CLEAR

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.354
DECISIONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.956
RESULT IN GETTING BAD COPS OFF

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.591
THE STREET. AND MAKING LIFE

DEPARTMENTS WHERE- WHERE. I

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.103
HAVE SOME ERRANT OFFICERS

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:55.370
BASICALLY IT PASSED ON TO

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:56.271

IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WAS

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.356
DISCUSSED IN THESE ARE TOO

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:22.991
DISPARATE ISSUES ONE WAS THE

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.693
BANE ACT AND WHAT THE TRIGGERS

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.295
WOULD BE FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.130
OFFICIAL TO BE PERSONALLY

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.531

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.371
TO THE TRIGGER AS SOME OF YOU

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:37.339
KNOW WHY I DIDN'T VOTE ON THE

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:39.208
BILL BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.376
IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE SHOULD

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:42.277
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WE

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:45.080
SHOULD. IT IS THAT WE SHOULD

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.316
ADDRESS IT IN A WAY. THAT FIXES

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.284
THE ISSUE AND DOESN'T SIMPLY

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.886
TURN OVER THE COURTS WAS THERE

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.154
IMPROVEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.755
BANE ACT ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.257
IMPROVEMENT. IS THERE STILL

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.992
AMBIGUITY THERE STILL AMBIGUITY

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.594
AS TO THE TERM CONSTITUTES A

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.530
CRIME OF VIOLENCE. SHOULD WE

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.398
FIX THAT WE SHOULD FIX THAT. IS

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.033
THERE AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.502
THE ADVISORY PANEL. THE PANEL

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.605
IS NOT JUST AN ADVISORY PANEL

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.939
IT SIMPLY GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.875
THIS IS A REAL PANEL THAT HAS

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:16.278
AUTHORITY. THIS IS A REAL PANEL

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:20.549
THAT CAN. MAKE DECISIONS THAT

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:23.619
IMPACT MANY FOLKS LIVES. HAVE

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.187
THERE BEEN JURIES HAVE THERE

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:27.522
BEEN FACT FINDERS HISTORICALLY

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:28.123
THAT IT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.093
THOSE. PERSONS OF COLOR

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.795
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. IS THE

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:36.298
WAY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM TO SAY

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.966
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:38.533
GOING TO SKEW IT IN ANOTHER

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.602
DIRECTION WE'RE GOING TO CREATE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.804
THE PERCEPTION. IF NOT THE

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:45.774
REALITY. THAT THIS PANEL. IS

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.509
SKEWED TO CORRECT THE

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.044
INJUSTICES OF THE PAST. I THINK

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:52.948
NOT. I THINK THAT THE WORK THAT

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.917
NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT IS

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:57.953

IT THROUGH HIS EYES- SOMETHING

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:16.198
THAT I CANNOT FEEL- WHAT IT IS

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.833

AND THE YOUNG NOBLE FEAR. THAT

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.678
IS ASSOCIATE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:32.080
THAT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.950
SYSTEMIC RACISM BUT BECAUSE OF.

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.718

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.540
CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN THE

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.275
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I SHOULD

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.881
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREE. I

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:06.415
HAVEN'T TALKED TO A SINGLE

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:09.284
PERSON. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

DOESN'T AGREE THAT THERE OUGHT

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:11.453

HAD THEIR KIDS MURDERED. AND

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.898

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:01.103
UNDERLYING RULE OF THUMB THAT

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.771
SEEMS TO HAVE EMERGED IN THE

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:05.340
CONTEXT OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.676
THAT SOMEHOW IT IS RACIST TO

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:09.811
ASK QUESTIONS. ESPECIALLY IF

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:13.982
YOU ARE WHITE. BUT SOMEHOW

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.617
DIGGING INTO DETAILS HERE AND

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.753
DOING THE WORK AS A SENATOR.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:22.324
WAS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. SOMEHOW

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.960
NOT OUR PURVIEW. NO WE SHOULD

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:28.797
FEEL ASHAMED. ARE GUILTY OF

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:33.301
DIGGING IN. DETAILS MATTER.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:35.737
GETTING THIS RIGHT MATTERS WE

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:36.438
WILL SET THE PACE FOR THIS

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:39.107
COUNTRY I HOPE THIS CONGRESS IS

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:41.443
WATCHING I HOPE THEY PASS THE

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:44.012
GEORGE FLOYD JUST POLICING ACT

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:47.048
AND I HOPE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:49.484
BUT IT IS UNFAIR AND IT IS.

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:52.554
UNBECOMING OF HIS BODY. TO

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:55.991
CASTIGATE OR DEMONISE

01:19:56.057 --> 01:20:02.330
COLLEAGUES. BASED ON THEIR RACE.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:02.964
WE'RE ALL ACTIVE HERE REPRESENT

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.667
OUR PEOPLE. AND I THINK THE

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:06.635
CRITICAL NATURE OF THE DEBATE

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:09.771
TODAY HERE AND GOING FORWARD.

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:10.505
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:14.976
MUST FIGHT FIERCELY TO PROTECT.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.244
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPACE ON

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:19.948
THIS LEGISLATION OR OTHER BILLS.

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:21.316
IF I DON'T HAVE EQUAL STANDING

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.118
TO ASK A QUESTION JUST LIKE

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:24.786
ANYBODY ELSE HERE. SOMETHING'S

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:30.592
WRONG. SO IN THAT SPIRIT I.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.862
THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:34.429
AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.598
MEASURE TODAY. BUT THERE ARE

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.234
BIG REASON THE FCTORS THAT THE

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:41.770
COMMISSION WILL BE LOOKING TO.

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.104
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES APPOINTED

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:46.041
SOME OF THESE OUT. WHAT IS

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:49.077
CONDUCT THAT DOESN'T RESPECT

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:51.112
THE RIGHTS OF THE PUBLIC. WHAT

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:54.616
IS THE NOT A VIOLATION OF LAW

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:58.753
BUT SOME OTHER VIOLATION QUOTE

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:03.024
SOME OTHER VIOLATION. THAT

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:03.491
MIGHT LEAD TO SERIOUS

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:06.528
MISCONDUCT. THE UNAUTHORIZED

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.730
USE OF FORCE INCLUDE NOT JUST

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:12.000
LEGAL FORCE OR ABUSIVE FORCE OR

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:14.803
PHYSICAL MISCONDUCT PUT. BUT A

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.571
MISTAKE FROM A DISPATCH

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:17.505
OPERATOR WHERE THERE'S A

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:19.040
MISTAKEN ARREST IN SOMEONE'S

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.976
HAND CUFF IS THAT IN ON

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:24.412
AUTHORIZE USE OF FORCE. WE NEED

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:25.714
TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.385
AFTER. THE WORST THE PEOPLE WHO

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.521
DISHONOR THIS PROFESSION. THERE

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:36.091
WERE NOT ALSO DETERRING YOUNG

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.392
PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT TO BE

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.660
GOOD OFFICERS BECAUSE WE STILL

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.595
NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.564
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WHO

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.899
HAVE OWNERS WHO WANT TO SERVE.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.836
I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT. THIS

01:21:47.902 --> 01:21:49.971
TREND IN OUR POLITICS RIGHT NOW.

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.474
WHERE WE BROAD BRUSH. AND

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.877
OSTRACIZING DEMONIZES TOXIC I

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.479
THINK IT'S GONNA ROAD THE

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:58.680
FABRIC OF OUR DEMOCRACY IF

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:02.050
WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. SO I LOVE

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:04.219
THIS SENATE FOR ITS WORK. I

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:05.353
SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.656
OF A MAJORITY LEADER JUDICIARY

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.596
I HOPEWE COMMIT OURSELVES TO A

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.031
DEBATE IS GOING TO BE

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:19.934
RESPECTFUL. AND SUBSTANTIVE.

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.670
ALCIDE FORCES WILL DO IT THEY

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:23.405
MAKE COLLEAGUES BUT- WE OWE IT

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:26.841
TO EACH OTHER TO RESERVE SPACE.

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.677
TO BE THE CENTER IS THAT WE ARE.

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:30.779
SO WITH THAT OUT HI I WILL.

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:33.448
URGE THE AUTHOR GOING FORWARD.

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.917
TO HOLD ON TO THAT SPACE IN THE

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:36.551
COURAGE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:39.788
TO DO THAT. TO GET THIS RIGHT.

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:43.058
IT'S PASSED THIS LAW THIS YEAR.

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.726

THINK I'VE BEEN FAIRLY

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:54.369
SUPPORTIVE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.537
LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING MY

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.072
TENURE HERE AND SO WHEN THIS

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.907
BILL CAME FORWARD TO MY DESK I

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:01.076
TOOK A LOOK AT IT. AND I TOO

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.444
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.112
COMPOSITION OF THE ADVISORY

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.347
BOARD AND THE ROLE OF THE

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.882
ADVISORY BOARD AND IF IN FACT

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.085
THE ADVISORY BOARD HAD THE

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:12.053
ACTUAL AUTHORITY TO- MAKE

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.723
DETERMINATIONS- AND IN FACT

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.691
MAKE A INITIAL DETERMINATION ON

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.426
THE DECERTIFICATION OF. A

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.894
PULLEY UP A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.330
OFFICER I WONDERED WHY. THE

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.965
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD WAS

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:26.668
THE- WHICH MADE UP THE WAY IT

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.470
WAS WITH. A COUPLE PEACE

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:31.339
OFFICERS AND CAN ADVOCATES ON

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:32.540
THE OTHER SIDE THAT- SEEM TO

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:34.876
BE- NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR TO

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.544
THOSE OF THE PEACE OFFICERS ON

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:37.779
THE BOARD IN ANY EVENT IT CAUSE

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:41.116
ME SOME. SOME CONCERN AND THEN

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.550
I USED TO BE A LAWYER MANY

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.085
YEARS AGO I DON'T CLAIM TO BE

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.755
SO ANYMORE BUT I DID LOOK AT

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:48.790
THE DEFINITION OF- SERIOUS

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.892
MISCONDUCT AND I WAS I WAS

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.094
BOTHERED BY THE- THE USE OF

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:54.562
TERMS SUCH AS VIOLATION OF THE

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:57.098
LAW AND I SAID WELL WHAT WAS IT

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.633
A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR. AN

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.835
INFRACTION- SOMETHING ELSE THAT

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:03.138
WASN'T DEFINED AND I WAS ALSO

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.540
BOTHERED BY. THE FOLLOW ON TO

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.109
THAT PHRASE IN ONE OR MORE OF

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.911
THE DEFINITIONAL SECTIONS OF

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.212
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:13.014
INCLUDED WORDS LIKE OR OTHER

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.116
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF A

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:17.252
PEACE OFFICER WORDS LIKE THAT.

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.253
AND SO I WAS BOTHERED BY THOSE

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:21.022
THINGS AND I TOOK A LOOK AT- AT

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:23.558
THE BILL. ITSELF AND PERHAPS

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.026
I'VE MISSED SOMETHING BUT WHAT

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.261
I FOUND WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:27.662
ADVISORY BOARD IN THE

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.531

COMMISSION TO MAKE

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.042
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN I

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.111
LOOKED. AT HOW THAT PROCESS

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:46.014
PLAYS OUT AND IT PLAYS OUT BYE.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.715

ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER SIDE

MAYBE THOSE SHOULD BE LIMITED

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.286
TO TWO. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.755
WHY YOU WOULD MAKE A LAWYER.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.490

NECESSARILY DETERMINATIVE AND I

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.034
THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

CERTAINLY. THE PROCESS NEEDS TO

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:24.105
MOVE FORWARD AND IN APPROPRIATE

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:34.782

THERE ARE NOT BEING A

JUDGING THE OFFICERS HAVE

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.906

FOR MANY OF YOU THIS BILL WILL

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.341
LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL

LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.430
MUST BE MET. THE BILL ALSO

01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:31.631
PROTECTS NEIGHBORHOODS FROM

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:34.434
SPECULATION AND GENTRIFICATION.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.436
LET ME FOCUS FOR A MINUTE ON

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.805
EXACTLY HOW IT DOES THAT. S. B.

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:39.939
NINE LIMITS INDIVIDUALS FROM

01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:41.207

INVESTORS. FROM CHANGING THE

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.115
LOOK AND FEEL OF NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:50.817
IT ALSO SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:52.518
PROFITEERS FROM ADDICTING ARE

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:54.854
DISPLACING TENANTS BY EXCLUDING

YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.327
HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE

SENATE HOUSING LEAD GROUP TO

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.430
IMPROVE THIS BILL. ONE

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:06.132
MODIFICATION IS THAT THE BILL

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:07.567
NOW PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:11.204
THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:13.273
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. ANOTHER

MINUTE MAKE CLEAR THE NUMBER OF

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:16.709
UNITS ALLOWED AND AT THE RISK

01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:18.378
OF SOUNDING LIKE A VERY BROKEN

01:55:18.444 --> 01:55:20.980
RECORD I'LL SAY IT AGAIN UP TO

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:23.383
FOUR UNITS ONLY. THERE ARE SO

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:24.651
MANY VARIABLES THAT MAKE A

01:55:24.717 --> 01:55:26.252
NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT IT IS THE

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.620
SIZE OF LIGHTS LOCAL

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:29.088
REQUIREMENTS THE DESIRE OF

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:30.723
HOMEOWNERS TO EVEN USE THIS

01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:32.492
OPTION. NOT EVERYONE WILL

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.160
CHOOSE TO DO A LOT SPLIT OR

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:36.162
TURN THEIR HOME INTO A DUPLEX

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:38.431
AND THAT IS OKAY. THIS MERELY

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:40.266
OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:42.935
WHO DO. AND I'D SAY TO THOSE

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:43.936
WHO ARGUE THAT THIS COULD

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.071
JEOPARDIZE THE LOOK OF THEIR

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:47.006
NEIGHBORHOOD LOOK AROUND YOU

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:48.141
THEY'RE ALREADY BEAUTIFUL

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.043
DUPLEXES AND ACCESSORY DWELLING

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.377
UNITS NEXT DOOR TO TRADITIONAL

01:55:51.444 --> 01:55:53.279
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND SOME

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:54.347

INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.282
CURRENCY WE KNOW IS CRUCIAL TO

ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS

01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:35.822
WERE OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE

01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.457
CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:39.425
HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND IT LED TO

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:41.561
OVERCROWDING. THIS BILL

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:42.528
PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS WITH

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:43.896
OPTIONS TO PROVIDE RENTAL

01:56:43.963 --> 01:56:46.199

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:49.068
TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:51.037

BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME IN THE

01:56:58.878 --> 01:57:00.646

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:04.684
pDOOR. THIS BILL IS AN EXPANSION

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:06.919

ALIKE. THE BILL CREATES AN

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:12.125
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. REAL

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:15.094
PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE CHANGE

INCLUSIVITY AND AFFORDABILITY.

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:21.534
AND WITH THAT I WOULD

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:23.636
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.738
VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

01:57:25.805 --> 01:57:29.575
ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON.

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:30.810
MISPRISION LATER IN JAIL IN THE

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:33.179
SENATE I VOTED FOR THIS BILL IN

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:35.882
COMMITTEE. AND I BOUGHT IT. IN

01:57:35.948 --> 01:57:37.383
GOOD CONSCIENCE USUALLY I'M

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:38.818
VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT ANYTHING

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:41.387
THAT CONSTRAINS LOCAL CONTROL

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:44.157
OR LOCAL AUTHORITY. READING THE

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:45.391
BILL AND LISTENING TO THE

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:47.226
DISCUSSION I DID NOT FIND THIS

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:49.195
BILL TO BE ONEROUS AT ALL IN

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:52.899
THAT DIRECTION. THAT I BELIEVE

01:57:52.965 --> 01:57:56.536
IT DOES MAKE GOOD SENSE. ONE

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:57.470
CONCERN I DO HAVE IS THE

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.839
SUCCESSOR LEGISLATORS WILL TRY

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:01.808
TO GET EXEMPTED FROM THIS AS

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:04.877
SOME HAVE A VERY LOW INCOME

01:58:04.944 --> 01:58:07.013
HOUSING ALLOWANCES. WE CANNOT

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:08.714
LET THAT HAPPEN THIS IS REALLY

01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:10.650
A BOTTOM LINE BILL BUT IT IS IT

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:12.685
IS A POSITIVE BILL. IT DOES

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:15.354
MOVE US AHEAD. AND I THINK IN

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:17.356
MANY AREAS IT WILL HELP

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:18.658
OVERCOME THE NEED IN THE

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:21.961
COMPLEX. I WOULD LOOK AT MAYBE

01:58:22.028 --> 01:58:24.197
IS A BIT OF A BALANCE. I DON'T

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:25.431
WANT TO CALL THE COMPROMISE

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.366
WITH THE BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.969
INTERESTS. THAT DON'T WANT TO

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:33.239
HAVE SUCH DENSITY IN THEIR

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:35.341
NEIGHBORHOODS. IT ISN'T THAT

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:38.110
RELATED TO DUPLEXES. THAT IS

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:39.312
NOT THE MOST ONEROUS I'VE LIVED

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:42.415
IN DUPLEXES. AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:46.118
THE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES HERE.

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:49.388
IS THE SOLUTION. AND THE

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:51.157
REPUTATION OF THE PRO TEM

01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:54.227
MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. THAT

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:55.995
MEANS THE ITEM AND THE ISSUE IS

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:59.031

UP ON EVERY. ONE OF THE HOUSING

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:03.883
BILLS BECAUSE PARKING IS A

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:06.585
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN SUBURBIA

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.020

GOVERNMENT TO REULATE. PARKING

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.536
WHEN IT IS A PUBLIC SAFETY

CONCERNS TO THE TABLE WE

02:03:24.296 --> 02:03:26.365
DISCUSSED THINGS AND WE WERE

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:28.200
ABLE TO INVITE OTHERS LIKE THE

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:29.969

AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES.

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.359

UNFAIR MONEY BAIL BUT LET ME BE

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:42.474
CLEAR IT IS NEVER ASKED THE

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:43.074
VOTERS TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT

02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:45.744
SYSTEM. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:46.912
WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:50.148
BOARD TO SHARPEN OUR PENCILS

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.784
AND REFINERY APPROACH. AND LOOK

02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:54.119
FOR A DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:55.320
WHAT REMAINED A SYSTEMICALLY

02:14:55.387 --> 02:14:58.123
UNFAIR AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL

02:14:58.190 --> 02:15:00.192
SYSTEM OF BAIL. WESUCH A

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:02.828
REFORM RATHER THAN REPLACE TO

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:04.463
CREATE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:05.664
WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE

02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:07.599
OF BAIL WITHOUT RELYING ON

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:09.201
ALGORITHMS A RISK ASSESSMENT

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:12.003
TOOLS WHICH WERE THEFOCUS OF

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:13.238
THE CAMPAIGN ON PROP TWENTY

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:15.607
FIVE. WE WANTED TO BE A 100%

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:17.309
SURE THAT OUR FRAMEWORK IN NO

02:15:17.375 --> 02:15:20.479
WAY RESEMBLED S. B. TEN. FOR

02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:22.514
GARDENS WE AGAIN LOOK TO THE

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.115
COURTS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:25.884
TO ENSURE THAT OUR NEW APPROACH

02:15:25.951 --> 02:15:27.219
HAS BEEN VETTED BY THE COURTS

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:28.520
THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTED THAT IT

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:30.622
WORKED IT WAS PRACTICAL. AND WE

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:32.724
ADOPTED A ZERO BAIL POLICY

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:34.593
ENACTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:37.529
LAST SPRING. WE KNOW THIS

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:39.531
APPROACH CAN WORK. OVER THE

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:41.366
COURSE OF THE FIVE MONTHS THAT

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.301
THE POLICY WAS IN PLACE JAIL

02:15:43.368 --> 02:15:44.903
POPULATIONS MEMBERS JAIL

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.205
POPULATION STATEWIDE. DECLINED

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:49.908
BY 30% WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT.

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.643
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON CRIME RATES

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:53.745
IN MAJOR CALIFORNIA CITIES IN

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:56.715
FACT. THIRTY ONE COUNTIES HAVE

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:58.850
RETAINED THE ZERO BAIL POLICY

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:03.355
IN SOME FORM. SINCE THEN THE

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:04.523
SENATOR FROM BERKELEY AND I

02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:06.591
INTRODUCED THIS BILL SEVERAL

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:08.827
MONTHS AGO SOME TREMENDOUS

02:16:08.894 --> 02:16:10.428
THINGS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OF

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:12.964
BAIL REFORM IN LATE MARCH OUR

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:14.733
CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:16.535
RULED IN THE CASE OF KENNETH

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.503
HUMPHRIES A SIXTY SIX YEAR OLD

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:20.138
MAN WHO STOLE SEVEN DOLLARS AND

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:22.340
A BOTTLE OF COLOGNE WAS HELD IN

02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:24.709
CUSTODY WITH BAIL SET AT AUST

02:16:24.776 --> 02:16:26.845
ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNT THAT WAS

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.647
IMPOSSIBLE TO AFFORD. IN ITS

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:30.649
DECISION THE SUPREME COURT

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:32.817
CONCLUDED QUOTE THE COMMON

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:34.152
PRACTICE OF CONDITIONING

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:35.954
FREEDOM SOLELY ON WHETHER AN

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:38.290
ARRESTEE CAN AFFORD. BAIL IS

02:16:38.356 --> 02:16:40.992
UNCONSTITUTIONAL I REPEAT THE

02:16:41.059 --> 02:16:43.495
SUPREME COURT SAID THE COMMON

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:44.729
PRACTICE OF CONDITIONING

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.565
FREEDOM SOLELY ON WHETHER AN

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:49.000
ARREST YOU COULD AFFORD BAIL IS

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:52.837
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE RULE THIS

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:54.139
THAT THEY MUST CONSIDER THE

02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:56.207
ABILITIES OF THE ARRESTEES

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:58.610
ABILITY TO PAY IN SETTING BAIL.

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:00.812
SO THE BOTTOM LINE MEMBERS IS

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:02.380
DESPITE ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:04.182
WE'VE SEEN ON THIS FLOOR IN THE

02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:04.716
OTHER CHAMBER AND HAS BEEN

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.952
DISCUSSED. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN

02:17:07.018 --> 02:17:08.954
LITIGATED AND ADJUDICATED THE

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:11.156
FIGHT OVER THE LEGALITY OF THE

02:17:11.222 --> 02:17:12.123
CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:15.527
OVER. IT IS OVER. AND I WANT TO

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:16.761
SPECIFICALLY SHARE WITH THE

02:17:16.828 --> 02:17:18.463
MEMBERS OF THIS CHAMBER. A

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:19.664
COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT THE

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:20.865
COURT MADE BECAUSE THOSE THE

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:22.400
PRECISE TO THE POINT THAT ME

02:17:22.467 --> 02:17:23.935
AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:25.403
SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE MADE

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:26.771
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOW

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.139
THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:30.342
SUPREME COURT DECISION. THE

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:31.576
CONSEQUENCES OF PRE TRIAL

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:34.112
DETENTION ARE ON ARRESTEES THEY

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:36.615
SAID ON THEIR LIVES OR MENTION

02:17:36.681 --> 02:17:38.583
PROFOUND BECAUSE IT HEIGHTENS

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.352
THE RISK OF LOSING A JOB. A

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:43.421
HOME IN CUSTODY OF A CHILD. THE

02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:45.056
CURRENT SYSTEM THEY SAID FORCES

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:46.958
THE STATE TO BEAR COSTS OF

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.293
FEEDING AND HOUSING ARRESTEES

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.828
THE COULD BE PROPERLY RELEASED

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.696
THEY SAID. PART OF THE

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:53.865
DISPARITY BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S

02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:56.434
HYPE A PRE DETENTION. RATE AND

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.769
OTHER STATES MAY ARISE FROM THE

02:17:57.836 --> 02:17:59.738
FACT THAT EVEN WHEN THE BAYLESS

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.539
TECHNICALLY ALLOWED THE AMOUNT

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:02.574
THAT MUST BE POSTED IS

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:04.643
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER. IN

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:05.744
CALIFORNIA ON AVERAGE THAN

02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:07.612
ELSEWHERE THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:10.982
MADE. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:13.118
IS THE LAW THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:15.320
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:16.454
HUMPHREY'S DECISION WAS OUR

02:18:16.521 --> 02:18:17.689
SUPREME COURT STATEMENT OF

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:19.157
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ON

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:21.259
PRE TRIAL JUSTICE. AND THIS

02:18:21.326 --> 02:18:23.695
MEASURE S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO

02:18:23.762 --> 02:18:25.096
PROVIDES A CLEAR AND EFFECTIVE

02:18:25.163 --> 02:18:27.065
BLUEPRINT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:28.767
THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:30.568
THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ALLEY OF

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:31.369
THE CURRENT MONEY BAIL

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:33.938
STRUCTURE. WE NEED A BLUEPRINT

02:18:34.005 --> 02:18:36.775
AND S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO IS THAT

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.243
BLUEPRINT. IT IS A

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:39.678
STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:41.079
MAKES CRITICAL REFORMS TO THE

02:18:41.146 --> 02:18:42.914
EXISTING BILL FRAMEWORK USING

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.549
STATED PRINCIPLES INVENTED

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.418
POLICIES OF THE SUPREME COURT.

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.386
AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HERE'S

02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:50.922
WHAT IT DOES IN ESSENCE FIRST

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:52.590
IT LEVELS THE PRE TRIAL PLAYING

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:54.726
FIELD BY SETTING BAIL AT ZERO

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:55.960
DOLLARS FOR MISDEMEANORS AND

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:57.829
LOW LEVEL FELONIES. WITHOUT

02:18:57.896 --> 02:19:00.165
ALLOWING REPEAT OFFENDERS TO

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:02.033
GAME THE SYSTEM SECOND. IT

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.835
ENSURES THAT THE ACCUSED DO NOT

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:07.138
ASSUME ANY COSTS OF COURT

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:09.641
IMPOSED REACH. CONDITION REALLY.

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:10.942
THREE REQUIRES BELL COMPANIES

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:12.343
TO REFUND THE PREMIUMS THEY

02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:13.878
RECEIVE FOR PEOPLE. WERE

02:19:13.945 --> 02:19:15.880
ARRESTED BUT ARE CHARGED BUT

02:19:15.947 --> 02:19:17.148
WHO HAVE THEIR CASES DISMISSED

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.083
REMAKE ALL OF THEIR COURT

02:19:18.149 --> 02:19:20.018
APPEARANCES. THE CURRENT BAIL

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:21.986
SYSTEM BASICALLY THEY CHARGE UP

02:19:22.053 --> 02:19:23.955
FRONT YOU DON'T GET CHARGED A

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:25.323
YEAR THEY THEY GET YOU OUT OF

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.858
JAIL THEY DON'T GET CHARGED.

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:27.959
YOU STILL LOSE YOUR MONEY

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.861
COMPLETELY UNFAIR SOMETHING YOU

02:19:29.928 --> 02:19:30.962
DON'T SEE IN ANY OTHER PART OF

02:19:31.029 --> 02:19:32.997
THE LAW. AND BY CODIFYING THE

02:19:33.064 --> 02:19:34.399
OPERATIVE LANGUAGE HUMPHRIES

02:19:34.466 --> 02:19:36.501
MUCH OF WHICH I JUST QUOTED. IT

02:19:36.568 --> 02:19:39.237
FROM THE SUPREME COURT S. P.

02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:40.004
TWO SIXTEEN TO INSURERS THAT

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.840
WHERE BAIL IS APPROPRIATE.

02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:44.242
COURTS DON'T SEE IT. HIGHER

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:45.810
SAID IT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:47.645
ACCUSED CAN REASONABLY AFFORD.

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:50.648
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. S. B.

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:51.382
TWO SIXTY TWO IMPLEMENTS THE

02:19:51.449 --> 02:19:53.084
HOPPER DECISION IMPLEMENTS

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:54.552
ADDITIONAL COUNCIL ZERO BILL

02:19:54.619 --> 02:19:56.354
POLICY WHICH HAS A PROVEN TRACK

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:57.822
RECORD. AND PROHIBITS THE

02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.158
UNFAIR USER YES AND PREDATORY

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:01.893
PRACTICES THE BILL IS FOR HIS

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.329
ENGAGING FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:05.663
THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:06.598
TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS WITH

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:08.933
RESPECT TO CERTAIN ISSUES ON

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.336
THE HUMAN TRACK I'M ON ON THE-

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:13.304
ZERO BAIL HATE CRIMES HUMAN

02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:14.305
TRAFFICKING CHILD ABUSE ELDER

ABUSE. ASSAULT WITH FORCE TO

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.375
CALL GREAT BODILY INJURIES

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:19.244
BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:19.811
THERE'S A FEW OTHER ONES AND

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.646
DOMESTIC TERRORISM. AND

02:20:21.713 --> 02:20:23.648
POSSESSING A GUN NEAR SCHOOL.

02:20:23.715 --> 02:20:25.583
WE CLEARLY WILL DEAL WITH THOSE

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.452
EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE DEALT WITH

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:28.853
THE REVOLVING DOOR ISSUE WITH

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:30.688
RESPECT TO THIS THING. AND I'VE

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:32.624
GOTTA SAY IN JUST THE BOTTOM

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:34.092
LINE IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.860
OF MONEY BAIL IS OBSOLETE. IT'S

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:37.362
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:38.830
FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN IT COST US

DOLLARS WITHOUT KEEPING US ANY

SAFER. AND WE HAVE DATA FROM

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:45.103
JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:47.372
QUEST THE STATE. INCLUDING

02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:48.339

TO PUT THE BLUEPRINT TOGETHER

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:50.201
OF WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

02:21:50.268 --> 02:21:51.970
COURT SAID WHEN THEY SAID THAT

02:21:52.036 --> 02:21:52.971
THE CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:55.607
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL I ASK THE

02:21:55.673 --> 02:21:57.308
ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR.

02:21:57.375 --> 02:22:00.745

WATER PRISON TERMS I GOT TO SEE

02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:12.523
THE MERITS OF THE BAIL SYSTEM

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:15.159
IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOES ENSURE

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:18.096
JUSTICE IT DOES ENSURE JUSTICE

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:20.164
FOR SOCIETY LET'S THINK ABOUT

02:22:20.231 --> 02:22:24.335
THAT JUST A BIT. BAIL SCHEDULES

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:27.505
ARE SET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:30.475
THAT'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR.

02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:34.045
MOST ASSUREDLY DALE ENSURES

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:36.414
THAT THE CONVICTED. OR THE

CONVICTED WITHIN YOUR CUES WILL

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:43.588
THEN DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE YOU

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.790
SHOW UP IN COURT. I DON'T AGREE

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:47.225
THAT EVERYBODY WILL JUST SHOW

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:50.395
UP. THE RECORD DOESN'T REALLY

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:55.366
SUPPORT THAT. MANY SKIPPED BAIL.

02:22:55.433 --> 02:23:01.406
BAIL IS A VERY USEFUL TOOL. AND

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:05.076

02:23:10.348 --> 02:23:12.317
VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO LAW

ENFORCEMENT WHAT DO I NEED.

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:19.557
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW. DOES

02:23:19.624 --> 02:23:22.126
NOT HAVE THE REACH TO DO NOT

02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:24.963
HAVE THE RESOURCES. THE CHANGE

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:30.735
BAIL JUMPERS. BONDSMEN ARE THEN

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:33.071
AN EXTRA ARM FOR LAW

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.973
ENFORCEMENT FOR THE CITIZENS

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:38.209
PROTECTION FOR THE INSURANCE AT

02:23:38.276 --> 02:23:41.145
THE INS SERVICE RIGHT THE

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:43.381
JUSTICE OF THE SYSTEM OF THE

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:48.820
SYSTEM. WHEN A CRIMINAL HAS A

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:52.123
GREEN SUN CITIZEN BE THAT A

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:55.560
RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY. OUR

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:59.130
MURDER RATE YOUR NAME. THIS IS

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.466
A DISCIPLINE TO ENSURE THAT

02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:04.068
THE- ACCUSED IS GOING TO SHOW

02:24:04.135 --> 02:24:08.106
UP FOR JUST THE SEARCH. AND

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:10.108
THAT'S NOT ABOUT ENRICHING ANY

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:11.909
PARTICULAR INDUSTRY THAT IS

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:14.579
ABOUT INSURING. THE COMFORT IN

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:18.716
THE PEACE. OF JUSTICE.

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:22.186
CORRECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA. NOW

02:24:22.253 --> 02:24:23.855
IF LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS SO

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:27.859
PERFECT. THEN WHY DID WE HAVE

02:24:27.925 --> 02:24:31.329
TO THEN. WAIT FOR A SUPREME

02:24:31.396 --> 02:24:33.965
COURT DECISION TO CORRECT THE

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:35.666
COURSEAS THIS BILL PURPORTS TO

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:40.471
DO. I WOULD SUBMIT IT PROBABLY

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:41.005
MAKES IT BETTER LADIES AND

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:45.610
GENTLEMAN. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:49.213
THAT WE SHOULD THROW OUT. DALE

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.681
THIS IS MAYBE A BIT OF A

02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:54.752
COMPROMISE BY THE PROPONENTS

02:24:54.819 --> 02:24:56.988
HOLD THE WORST CRIMES. FOLKS

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:59.123
WERE LEFT IN THE LEFT WORST

02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:02.760
CRIMINALS OUT OF PRISON TODAY.

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:03.928
AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE'LL

02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:05.663
GET TO THAT ANOTHER MATTER

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:10.034
ANOTHER DEBATE. I BELIEVE THAT

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:12.770
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR US

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:16.207
TO RETAIN THE DISH ONE OF BAIL

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:17.975
THAT HAS WORKED WELL FOR MANY

02:25:18.042 --> 02:25:21.479
DECADES. WHO DID IT NOT WORK

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:25.016

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:25.516
WORK OUT TOO HOT FOR THE

ACCUSED. WHO WANTED TO RUN.

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:30.788
LET'S GET BAIL AND NOT FACE

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:36.160
JUSTICE. KEEP IN MIND THAT IT

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:40.598
IS NOT JUST THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:42.834
IT IS ALSO AN ASPECT A PUBLIC

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.671
SAFETY IN A CHURCH THAT THE

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:49.073
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:52.376
HOLD THEIR JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS.

02:25:52.443 --> 02:25:55.513
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS SHOW UP IN

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:59.417
COURT. AND IN NO SMALL MEASURE

02:25:59.484 --> 02:26:04.188
BECAUSE- THE BAIL BONDS. PUT

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:08.426

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:09.560

AUTHOR BEST B. TWO SIXTY TWO

02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:28.646
I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I HAVE TO

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:30.882
EXPLAIN THINGS SIMPLY BUT NOT

02:26:30.948 --> 02:26:33.050
INACCURATELY AND MY YEARS ON

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:34.619
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.721
HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PARSE. THE

02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:39.857
LAW. TWO IN A WAY BECAUSE WHEN

02:26:39.924 --> 02:26:42.460
I WOULD HEAR VARIOUS TESTIMONY

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:44.262
AND NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:46.697
IT I HAD TO SPEND HOURS. REALLY

02:26:46.764 --> 02:26:48.132
TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS TO

02:26:48.199 --> 02:26:50.134
HELP ME BREAK IT DOWN AND

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:52.970
UNDERSTANDING SO LET ME TELL

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:55.640
YOU IN MY SIMPLE WORDS. THAT WE

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:57.875

AND YOU HAVE TO STAY THERE. AND

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:08.586
THAT WILL TEST FOR FREEDOM.

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:10.188
MEANS THAT THOSE WHO ARE FORCED

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:12.156
TO WAIT IN JAIL FACE A

02:27:12.223 --> 02:27:13.925
SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHILDREN.

02:27:13.991 --> 02:27:15.459

02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:19.897
pTHEIR JOBS. THEY CAN LOSE THAT

02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:21.399
WHERE THEY LIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:27:21.465 --> 02:27:22.967
SITTING IN JAIL MAYBE THEY

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:25.136
DIDN'T PAY RENT. I REMEMBER

TESTIMONY ONCE IN A PUBLIC

02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:28.039

YOU'RE REMOVING YOUR HOME FOR

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:44.322
SIX YEARS. NOW THE THING ABOUT
