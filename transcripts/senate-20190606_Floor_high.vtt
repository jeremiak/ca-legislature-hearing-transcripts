00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.553
BUT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.655
MISTER PRESIDENT.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.423
THAT I AM IN SUPPORT.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:46.491
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ALL OF

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:47.859
US KNOW THAT.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.128
THE INVASION AND EUROPE -- KNOWN

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:51.763
AS THE DAY.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.199
WAS SO DETRIMENTAL. TO OUR

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.234
SUCCESS IN EUROPE.

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:59.371
BUT THE HEROISM THAT THESE MEN.

00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:01.573
WHO -- IN THIS CASE I'VE GOT A

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.175
HIGHLIGHT THESE PARATROOPERS

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:04.810
BECAUSE OF A DEBT OF GRATITUDE

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.578
IS OWED TO THEM.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:08.113
THE BAND OF BROTHERS WE'VE HEARD

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.281
ABOUT.

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:12.384
THE RANGERS WHO SCALE THE THE

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:12.984
MOUNTAINSIDE TO GET UP TO THE

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:14.553
TOP.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.521
BUT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU.

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:19.624
SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THIRTEEN

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:20.892
THOUSAND PARATROOPERS JUMPED.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:24.563
INTO FRANCE BEHIND ENEMY LINES.

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.364
BUT I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:27.632
TO TALK ABOUT THE AIRMEN IN

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:28.900
THOSE AIRPLANES.

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.836
THE ARMY AIR CORPS.

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:33.438
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT.

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:36.041
OVER.

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:36.641
SIX THOUSAND THE EIGHTY SECOND

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:37.209
AIRBORNE.

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:39.411
PARTICIPATED MANY MANY WERE

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.746
WOUNDED AND KILLED.

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.648
BUT LISTEN TO THIS A FLEET.

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.517
OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.118
AIRCRAFT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.653
NINE C..

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.421
FORTY SEVEN DROP THESE

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:52.023
PARATROOPERS BEHIND THE LINES --

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.693
THAT ONE OH FIVE I'M SORRY AT

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:55.260
ONE FIFTY ONE IN THE MORNING

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.061
THAT STATE MERRY PLEASED WITH

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.829
THE EIGHTY SECOND.

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.798
BUT THE FACT IS THAT SO MANY OF

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:04.069
THESE PLANES WERE SHOT DOWN.

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:06.338
FORTY TWO AIRCRAFT WERE LOST.

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:08.506
IMAGINE LADIES IN GERMAN FORTY

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:09.407
TWO AIRCRAFT FILLED WITH

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:10.709
PARATROOPERS.

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:14.079
AND ARMY AIR CORPSMAN. FORTY TWO

00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:15.881
THESE WERE WERE SHOT DOWN EVEN

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:18.583
BEFORE THE JUMP HAPPEN.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.185
AND IT IS AMAZING WHAT THEY HAD

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:21.386
TO DO EVEN BEFORE THE JUMP

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.188
ITSELF.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:24.689
THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE ALONG

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:25.223
WITH THE HUNDRED AND FIRST

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.324
AIRBORNE.

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:27.626
AS I SAID JUMP BEHIND ENEMY

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:30.695
LINES PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE

00:25:30.762 --> 00:25:31.263
DURING THOSE EARLY DAYS OF

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:32.464
FIGHTING.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.433
AND STOP THE RESERVES FROM

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.502
COMING ACROSS IN STOPPING THE

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.204
INVASION.

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.205
THEN I STAND HERE'S A FELLOW

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:43.108

00:25:43.174 --> 00:25:44.776
THE SAY THANK YOU TO THE MEN WHO

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.011

WE HAVE TODAY.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.792
THAT IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT WE

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.069
THAT ALL OF US CAME TOGETHER AT

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.437
A TIME.

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.772
WHEN THEY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:15.507

STEPFATHER AFTER HE PASSED AWAY

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.929

TYPE THING THAT THE G. EYES

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.268
WOULD BE USED TO WRITE TO THE

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.070
FAMILIES OR THEIR LOVED ONES

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:54.005
HOME.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.241
AND HE WROTE TO HIS MOTHER AND

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.475
ACTUALLY EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.677
THE SERVER.

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:01.279
AS I'M RAMBLING THREE THESE

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.748
THINGS AND THEY WERE GENERALLY

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.850
VERY INNOCUOUS BECAUSE THEY WERE.

00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:08.219
HEAVILY CENSORED.

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:09.921

AT THE DATE.

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:34.145
THAT WAS THE DAY.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.647
HE WAS IN THE HANDS ARMY AIR

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:38.149
CORPS.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.218
WHAT WOULD BE CALLED TODAY?

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:42.053
AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.987
WATCHING.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:45.623
THOSE PLANES.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:46.825
MAYBE EVEN SOME THAT CARRIED

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.726

HE WAS WATCHING THOSE PLANES AND

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.370
THEN HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:00.772
WHO.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:04.342
DID NOT COME BACK.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.945
BUT THE UNDERSTATED WAY.

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.613
THAT HE PLACE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.482
HIS MOTHER.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:11.850

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:14.886
GENERATION.

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.855
THEY WERE HEROES WHO.

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.958
TRIED TO AVOID.

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.159
THE GLORY IN THE BURDEN OF HAIR

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.428
WAS.

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:26.698
THEY WERE HUMBLE MEN AND WOMEN.

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.266
WHO DIDN'T GO ABOUT TELLING

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.234
