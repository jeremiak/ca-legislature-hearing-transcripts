00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:20.952
DATE SO THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:25.924
LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.760

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:34.265
THAT AGAIN IS A FURTHER HAIR

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.267
CUT AND ALSO WITH THE STUDENT

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.735
AID DATA THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.837
FIND BASED ON A REMAINING

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.272
STUDENT LOAN PRINCIPLE AFTER

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.473
THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WE WERE

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.075
LOOKING AT ONLY SIX MILLION

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:46.411
DOLLARS SO ONLY A THREE MILLION

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:49.447
DOLLAR. OVERALL RIGHT AND THEN

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.984
YOU HAVE THAT 250% AND YOU GET

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.421
THREE MILLION. RIGHT AND BUT

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:57.956
THEN WE ARE ALSO EXCLUDING FROM

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:59.791
INCOME AS OPPOSED TO EVER

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:00.858
INCLUDING IN INCOME SO THIS IS

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.961
SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT. THIS

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.797
IS AN INCOME EXCLUSION. SO DOES

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:09.400
NOT ON THE TAX RETURN DIRECTLY.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.001
OKAY BUT IT'S STILL GONNA COST

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.670
IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:15.840
I'M NO AT A 6% TAX RATE- AND

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:18.743
BAY- IT'S- I'M SORRY IT'S NOT

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.311
CLOSE THROUGH THE TAX RETURN

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:21.646
RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST A STRAIGHT

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:24.349
THREE MILLION. OKAY IT'S ONLY

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:26.484
6% OF THAT OF WHATEVER THE

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.453
TAXES DO SO EVEN THE THREE

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.321
MILLION MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:33.424
BEEN ALL TAXABLE IF IT WERE

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.193
OTHERWISE INCLUDED IN INCOME

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.862
BECAUSE OF OTHER DEDUCTIONS ARE

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:40.732
OFFSETS THAT A STUDENT MAY HAVE.

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:41.266
YOU'RE GRANTING THEM THREE

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:43.868
MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. WE

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.537
BELIEVE SO WHY ISN'T THE COST

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.106
THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THE

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:51.075
COST ON THE TAXES SO IT'S THREE

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.411
MILLION OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.212
AND THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:56.381
INCLUDE IT. NO IT'S THE THREE

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.850
MILLION IS APPLIED THERE'S A AN

00:31:58.916 --> 00:31:59.350
AVERAGE TAX RATE THAT IS

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:02.920
APPLIED. AND THAT IS WHAT THE

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:03.521
DIFFERENCE TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:10.495
WOULD BE. 6% OF THREE MILLION.

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:13.398
OKAY HEY OKAY AYE AYE AYE ALL

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:15.500
RIGHT LOOSES AGAIN AS IT RUNS

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:16.668
THROUGH THE TAX RETURN AND

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:17.935
THERE'S OTHER DEDUCTIONS OR

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:20.505
EXEMPTIONS EXCLUSIONS THAT

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:23.341
SOMEONE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:23.908
THAT ALSO COMES INTO PLAY IN

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:24.709
THE FINAL NUMBER. I'M SO GLAD

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:28.713
SHE'S HERE. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:36.187
QUITE HEAR YOU. ALL RIGHT.

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:36.788
YOU'RE REWARDING THREE MILLION

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:39.824
DOLLARS WE BELIEVE SO. AT

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.894
THIRTY GETTING AWAY CORRECT WE

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.228
HAVE ASSUME YES IT'LL BE FULLY

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.897
FUNDED AND THAT WOULD BE THE

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.432
FUNDED HOWSAM ON THAT COULD BE

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:49.367
GRANTED OKAY BUT HOW IS IT

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:53.104
FULLY FUNDED. THAT IS A

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.672
FUNCTION OF THE BILL. OR STAND

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.307
IT WOULD NEED APPROPRIATIONS

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.909
HELP IT'S NOT FUNDED THROUGH

00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:59.043
THE BUDGET IT DOES THE BILL

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.712
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:04.048
CORRECT I SEE ALL RIGHT. THAT'S

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:05.717
WHY THE NUMBERS SO LOW. DOES

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.251
COME INTO PLAY YEAH IT IT IT

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.053
HAS TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.054
BUDGET ALL RIGHT NOW I

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.423
UNDERSTAND. SO IT'S THREE

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.126
MILLION DOLLARS IF IT'S FUNDED

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:17.195
THROUGH THE BUDGET AND IT'S

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.062
NEXT TO NOTHING OTHERWISE. OKAY

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:26.537
NOW I UNDERSTAND OF. SO I JUST

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.106
TO BRING AND THEN ONE OTHER

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.841
POINT THAT'S BROUGHT UP IN THE

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:34.112
ANALYSIS IS. V. E. ARE

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:37.548
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:40.752
IT'LL BE FEDERALLY TAXED. I

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.120
SINCE IT'S A GRANT IT'S INCOME.

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:45.957
AND SO THAT. PERSON WHO GOT

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.091
THIS MONEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:48.993
WHATEVER THEIR FEDERAL TAX

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.629
AMOUNT IS ON THAT AMOUNT

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.363
BECAUSE RATHER THE LOAN

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.965
FORGIVENESS IT TO GRANT SO IT'S

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:59.337
INCOME. ARM AND- THEIR WAYS TO

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:01.806
GET AROUND THAT BUT- I CAN SEE

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.641
WHY YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY PUT

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.509
IN THE BILL DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.477
COMMENT ON THAT DOOR FOR

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.112
WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:08.646
COMPLEXITIES BUT WE THINK

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:11.749
THEY'RE ALL WORKABLE. OKAY.

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:15.820
THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS. YOU

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:16.387
KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:19.190
BURN OUT. BUT IF WHAT YOU'RE

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:24.295
TRYING TO DO. IS PROMOTE PEOPLE

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.397
TO STAY WHY IS IT THREE YEARS.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:31.202
THAT'S THE AVERAGE. TIME THE

00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:33.037
MOST THE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AS

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.740
YEAH I'D SO WHY NOT MAKE IT

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:36.474
FIVE YEARS TO AT LEAST KEEP

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.609
THEM AROUND A COUPLE MORE YEARS

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.545
THE POINT IS YOU'RE NOT GIVING

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.146
IT YOUR SPENDING THREE MILLION

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:43.481
DOLLARS BUT YOU'RE NOT

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.216
NECESSARILY GETTING ANYTHING

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:47.418
FOR IT. IF PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.221
SPENDING THREE YEARS ALREADY

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:53.024
WHY NOT THEN YOU KNOW DO

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:53.624
SOMETHING SO THOSE STAY A BIT

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:56.794
LONGER. SO THE POINT IS YOU

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.963
NEED MORE SOCIAL WORKERS THERE

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.998
TYPICALLY LEAVING AFTER THREE

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:04.302
YEARS. IF YOU KEEP THIS. TIME

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:06.270
PERIOD IS THREE YEARS THEN HOW

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.039
ARE YOU GOING TO ENCOURAGE

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:09.106
PEOPLE TO STAY A LONGER PERIOD

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:11.642
OF TIME. WHY NOT MAKE IT FIVE

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.344
YEARS AND THEN YOU AT LEAST GET

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:15.446
A COUPLE EXTRA YEARS OUT OF IT

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:17.148
THAT'S CLEARLY AN ALTERNATE

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:18.182
PERSPECTIVE BUT I WOULD SAY

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:20.051
THAT WE WANT TO GET ON WITH

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:20.618
THEIR MOST VULNERABLE PERIOD

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.185
WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE THREE

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:22.286
YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:26.624
BECAUSE YEAH PLEASE IF I COULD

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:27.592
ADD SOMETHING THAT GO WITH THE

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:28.993
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.495
WORKERS THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.263
PROGRAM THAT HELPS PEOPLE WHILE

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.199
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL IF THEY-

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:35.833
AGREE IT'S CALLED THE TITLE FOR

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.101
YOU PROGRAM IF THEY DOES IF

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:39.504
THEY PROMISE TO MAKE A TWO YEAR

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.838
COMMITMENT IN THE CHILD WELFARE

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:43.174
SYSTEM WHEN THEY GRADUATE SO WE

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.209
DO FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:47.478
LEAVING AFTER TWO YEARS I THINK

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:48.913
THREE YEAR IS A MARK BUT THAT

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.182
TWO YEARS IS A HUGE MARK ALSO

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:53.184
SO. I THINK THAT- ASSEMBLY

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.852
MEMBER CHOOSING THE THREE YEAR

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.088
TIME FRAME MAKES SENSE OKAY.

PROFESSION RIGHT IN AND MY

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:02.566
CONCERN IS THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:34.698
FOR PEOPLE WHO A TAX CREDIT.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.299
