YOU WOULD APPEAR TO BE THAT REGULATIONS ARE BAD. ASSEMBLY ABOUT THE REGULATIONS ARE PROTECTION WHICH SAFEGUARDS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA DEPENDS ON THE PROTECTIONS LIKE REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE STATE WORKPLACES ARE PAID AND TREATED FAIRLY ACTIVE TO CLEAN AIR AND WATER AND ARE PROTECTED FROM SERIOUS HARM BY INCOMPETENT OR NEGLIGENT PRACTITIONERS.

MANY REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT CHINA THAT THE GENTLEMAN ARTICULATED. HOWEVER I THINK AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF AGENCIES TURNING WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN SOME CASES DUPLICATIVE.

SO AB TWO AT ITS CORE- IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT UNDULY IMPACTED AND BURDENED BY CUMBERSOME REGULATIONS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE INDIVIDUATION SEATS REVIEW AND UPDATE REGULATIONS WHICH CAN WORSEN ECONOMIC EFFECTS FELT BY THE COBIT NINETEEN PENDEK HE SAID AS YOU SAID- MADAM CHAIR REGULATIONS TO BE ACCURATE AND CONSISTENT.

THE MOTION FOR A B. TWO IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PETRIE-NORRIS HI PETRIE-NORRIS HI PATTERSON. BURKE BURKE I GRADE LACKEY MEDINA MEDINA HI RODRIGUEZ. OKAY THREE OH THAT BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU HAVE ALLOW OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WHEN THEY TRAIN US. MAYBE ON TO FILE ITEMS SIX AB FOUR SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER MEMBERS. TROPICAL AND BOREAL FORESTS ARE AMONG THE MOST CARBON DENSE FORESTS ON EARTH AND THEY PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN STORING CARBON AND PROVIDE HABITAT FOR COUNTLESS ANIMAL AND PLANT SPECIES. THE DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF THESE PORES DUE TO INDUSTRIAL SCALE EXPLOITATION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE. AS WELL AS A WIDE RANGING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS PROTECTING INDIGENOUS WAS STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE OF THESE LANDS. AB FOUR SIXTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION FREE PROCUREMENT ACT WOULD REQUIRE ANY ENTITIES CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CERTIFY THEY'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL OR BURIAL FOREST LOSS DIRECTLY. OR THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. RIVAS VERSION OF THIS BILL IS PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AB FOUR SIXTEEN IS MODELED AFTER AN EXISTING SWEAT FREE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STATE CONTRACTS A PROCUREMENT BAN AGAINST CHILD LABOR. SO THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO PROCUREMENT POLICIES THE STATE IS IMPLEMENTED IN PAST YEARS TO HELP ENSURE THE CONTRACTORS WERE WORKING WITH ARE NOT ENGAGING IN HARMFUL PRACTICES. ALSO IN ORDER TO PROMOTE BEST PRACTICES SB FOUR SIXTEEN REQUIRES OUR DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO DEVELOP THE DEFORESTATION FREE CODE OF CONDUCT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO CONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY FOREST RISK COMMODITIES IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD CALIFORNIA'S PURCHASING POWER HAS SIGNIFICANT MARKET FORCE AND THIS BILL EXTENDS OUR STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. THE PROTECTION OF TROPICAL AND BOREAL FORESTS. BY ADOPTING THE PROCUREMENT POLICY. WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE STATE IS NOT AN INADVERTENT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF TROPICAL AND BOREAL FORESTS. AND WE'RE SENDING A CRUCIAL SIGNAL TO GLOBAL MARKETS BUT ILLEGAL AND DESTRUCTIVE COMMODITY DRIVEN DEFORESTATION AND PRIMARY FOREST DEGRADATION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT BY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THROUGH SUPPLY CHAIN ACCOUNTABILITY. WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP TO DRIVE BETTER PRACTICES IN THE LONG TERM AS PART OF THE STATE'S BROAD COMMITMENT TO LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH SOME CONCERNS BEEN RAISED. BY THE BUILDING INDUSTRY MONICA VERY CLEAR THIS BILL SPECIFIC TO ONLY STATE PROCUREMENT. AB FOUR SIXTEEN ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM INDIGENOUS LEADERS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY EXPERTS WILDLIFE ADVOCATES THANK MURSCHEL BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. UP WITH ME TODAY ON THE PHONE IS JEFF CONANT ABOUT THE SENIOR INTERNATIONAL FORCE PROGRAM MANAGER WITH FRIENDS OF THE EARTH U. S. AND JENNIFER SCHEME THE NATIONAL NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS POLICY MANAGEMENT THE CANADA PROJECT. OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AT MODERATOR YOU PLEASE CONNECT US WITH JEFF CONANT. I NEVER OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANKS CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN I PICKED UP OKAY YES OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA MY NAME IS JEFF CONTENT THAT I REPRESENT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB FOUR SIXTEEN. EVERY THREE DAYS THE WORLD LOSES AN AREA OF FOREST THE SIZE OF LOS ANGELES WHAT WE LOSE WHEN WE LOSE OUR FORESTS WE LOSE COUNTLESS SPECIES TAMARKIN RHINO THE BORNEAN ORANGUTANS GREAT APES CARIBOU NUMBERLESS MIGRATORY BIRDS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LOSE THEIR CULTURES LANGUAGES AND LYFT WEIGHTS AND WE LOSE OUR LAST BEST CHANCE TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE RUNAWAY CLIMATE CHAOS BECAUSE ABOUT A QUARTER OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. RESULT FROM DEFORESTATION AND THE DEGRADATION OF INTACT PRIMARY FOREST AT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN U. N. CLIMATE SUMMIT GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRY AND CIVIL SOCIETY CAME TOGETHER INSIDE THE NEW YORK DECLARATION ON FORESTS A COMMITMENT TO REDUCE GLOBAL DEFORESTATION BY HALF BY TWENTY TWENTY AND ENDED BY TWENTY THIRTY CALIFORNIA AS A CLIMATE LEADER WAS A SIGNATORY TO THIS DECLARATION. WHEN THE U. N. ACEST PROGRESS IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT DID IT FIND NOT ONLY HAVE THE WORLD MISSED THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET GLOBAL DEFORESTATION HAD INCREASED BY OVER 40% AND WHY IS DEFORESTATION INCREASING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ECONOMIC OR REGULATORY INCENTIVE TO STOP IT. AB. FOUR SIXTEEN CAN CHANGE THAT. I WITH EFFORTS UNDERWAY IN EUROPE COUPLED WITH THE- BILL IN THE THAT IS NEARLY A CARBON COPY OF AB FOUR SIXTEEN. THIS BILL CAN INITIATE A GROUNDBREAKING APPROACH TO USING THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC PURSE TO REFER. TO REVERSE ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF HUMAN AND CORPORATE ACTIVITY. A DRAFT STUDY REVEALED THAT ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC PURCHASING INFLICTED DEFORESTATION RISK. THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC PURCHASING THE COULD BE LEVERAGED TO SAVE THE WORLD'S FORESTS BUT INSTEAD IS PAYING FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION. VIRTUALLY EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY WANT TO SEE THIS BILL BECOME LAW NOT ONLY THAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY IS BEHIND THE BILL A COALITION OF RESPONSIBLE INVESTORS WHO COLLECTIVELY MANAGE ONE POINT FIVE. TRILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS WILL SHORTLY SUBMIT A LETTER MAKING THE CASE THAT AB FOUR SIXTEEN GOOD FOR BUSINESS. WHY BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR INDUSTRY. IT WILL CREATE MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS THAT WILL HOLD CORPORATION TO A STANDARD OF ENVIRONENTAL STEWARDSHIP OF THE MARKETPLACE INCREASINGLY DEMAND. AND THAT WILL HELP PRESERVE OUR WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. SO I HEARD YOU RESPECTFULLY TO PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB FOUR SIXTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO INTACT FORESTS WHAT THAT MEANS IS FOR EXAMPLE IN CANADA THE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE FOREST IS COMMERCIALLY MANAGED THIS WOULDN'T APPLY. TO THOSE PORTIONS OF THE FOREST IS INTACT FORESTS WAS THE FOURTH IT HAS NOT EVER BEEN DEVELOPED OR LOG OR IN OTHER WAYS COMMERCIALLY USED IN SELF I COMMEND- CANADA THAN AND COMPANIES THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY MANAGING FORESTS IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE AND- AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS WHAT HAVE YOU THAT SUBSTANTIATE THAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC AND SO THIS BILL DOESN'T IMPACT THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE THERE IN FACT CANNOT BE CELEBRATE RESPONSIBLE UP VOTE FOR THE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT THIS BILL IS MOST PACIFIC LEE- JUST TARGETING INTACT FORESTS WHICH IS THE ONE THAT THE SUN. OF FORESTS AND ALSO REALLY MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT ESPECIALLY YOU LOOK AT THE TROPICAL FOREST IN THE DEGREE OF DEGRADATION THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THE SOME COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BOTH IN TROPICAL AS WELL AS IN BOREAL ENVIRONMENTS I HAVE STARTED TO PICK UP THE PACE IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT.

TO DETERMINE THE FORM AND CONTENT REQUIRED FOR COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS ALTHOUGH THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE BELIEVE FURTHER CLARITY IS STILL NEEDED IN THE BILL ON THE LEVEL OF AN OF DETAIL REQUIRED IN THESE PLANS. AS WELL AS YOU BUT POTENTIALLY PUT A POTENTIAL DISAGREEMENT COULD STILL OCCUR BETWEEN CONTENT OF A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OF THE STATE AGENCY AND THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AND HOW THAT WOULD BE RESULT IN CLOSING WE APPRECIATE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF. IN HOPES THAT OUR CONCERNS TO BE FULLY ADDRESSED UNTIL SUCH TIME WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB EIGHT ONLINE UNLESS FURTHER AMENDED THANK YOU. I THINK YOU MISSED MARTINEZ.

NINE THIRTY ONE IN THE HARING ROOM PUSHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION SCENE NINE ALTERNATE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT I'M I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FIRST I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE TO ADD SOME CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS TO THE BALLOT JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT YOU'LL BE ACCEPTING. THOSE AMENDMENTS GREAT AND THEN. I JUST WANNA PICK UP ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED- THEY- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISCLOSURE OF. SENSITIVE VULNERABILITY INFORMATION- HOW HAVE WE NAVIGATED. THIS CHALLENGE WHICH MUST BE THE SAME. CHALLENGE AS-WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THESE STRENGTHENED CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOLS ACROSS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT AND- OBVIOUSLY ANY OTHER. POINTS THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION CERTAINLY SO- THERE'S A LONG HISTORY WITH THIS BILL AND INITIALLY WE HAD ASKED THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. WHICH IS WHERE ALL THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES A REPORT TO SO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY% FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS REALLY DOING. MOST OF THE OVERSIGHT. BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD WHEN I GO A QUARTERLY. TO A SECURE ROOM AND LOOK AT THE REPORTS TO SEE HOW THE- HOW THE VULNERABILITIES ARE IMPROVING THE NUMBER OF CLICKS ARE IMPROVING AND- THE DIFFERENT METHOD METRICS TO SHOW WHAT HOW MATURE THE- CYBERSECURITY STANCES OF. THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND THAT WAY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS ARE. BY THE WAY THAT THIS IS NOTHING THAT IS TOP SECRET THIS IS. YOU DO NOT HAVE GOOD PASSWORD PROTOCOLS OR YOU ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH EMPLOYEE TRAINING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DON'T CLICK ON LINKS HELP. FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL AND- SO NOT NOT THE TYPE OF VULNERABILITIES THAT ARE IF THEY WERE EVEN OUT IN THE PUBLIC WHICH THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T BE THE- ASSEMBLY HAS- THE COMPLETE ABILITY TO KEEP EVERYTHING. CONFIDENTIAL AND YOU KNOW WE ARE PROTECTED BY CHP THERE ARE LOCKS THEY'RE LOCKED- HERE AT SAFE HERE THERE IS THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS THAT. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE- THE HEAD OF PRIVACY LOOK AT THESE CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS. THE AT THE AMENDMENT THAT THEY ASKED FOR THAT THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH WAS. FOR THE HEAD OF PRIVACY TO GO TO EVERY TO BERMAN SEPARATELY- THERE ARE TWO TWO A THEM AND THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN. SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS. AND- TO TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BUT WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR AS I SAID THIS HAS BEEN A FOUR YEAR EFFORT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN- RESISTANT OR CONCERNED ABOUT. AND AT THIS POINT THE AUDITOR IS HAS HAS DEFINITELY POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO COME TO A RESOLUTION SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVE A COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH ALL THE GROUPS BUT WITH A DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE. THANK YOU FOR DRESSING NOT THANK YU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO A SEPARATE SECURITY AND ENSURING PRIVACY- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE A- PERFECTLY AFTER I BROKE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OUT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND A SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. MADAM SECRETARY WOULD YOU IT'S AT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PHIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. YOU PETRIE-NORRIS HI THREE NORTH SIDE PATTERSON.

ARE MOVING ON TO AB AT. NINE TWENTY THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM US WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT MOTION SECOND ON THEIR OWN OR DO STAVING NINETY THREE AFTER TWO YEARS OF WORK- WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AFTER SEVERAL HEARINGS THAT IN THAT COMMITTEE THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED WAS OVERWHELMING IN THIS INDICATION OF A BROKEN CONSULTATION SYSTEM IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AND THIS BILL IS A BIG STEP TOWARD SOLVING THOSE ISSUES BUT ALSO SHOULD BE SEEN AS A FIRST STEP. MANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE LEVEL AGENCY STAFF HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE IN EDUCATION IN THEIR ISSUE AREAS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY LITTLE TO NONE IN THE AREA OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS TRIBAL CULTURE OR GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION. THIS BILL WILL CREATE ADEQUATE TRAINING FOR OUR STATE AGENCY STAFF. BUILT UPON THE DIRECT INPUT OF TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA TRIBES. SO THAT THEY CAN APPROPRIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY INTERACT WITH OUR STATE'S TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THIS ISSUE BECOMES PARTICULARLY APPARENT IN RECENT YEARS AS WILDFIRES AND COVERT NINETEEN HAVE INCREASED THE NEED FOR FAST AND EFFECTIVE CONSULTATION BETWEEN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS UNFORTUNATELY. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THAT HAVE OCCURRED HAVE HAD HUMAN AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THIS REASON WE MUST TAKE ACTION TO BOLSTER OUR STATE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION AT ADEQUATELY PREPARE OUR AGENCY THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT AND IN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE MORONGO BAND OF MISSION INDIANS THE SALMON WELL BAND OF MISSION INDIANS THE YUROK TRIBE. JUDGE A DAY HE BOROUGH NOT AND MANY OTHERS. WE SEE THIS AS A FIRST STEP IN MOVING FORWARD JOINING ME TODAY ARE CAROLINE BEALE HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE YOSHI DAY HE WENT TO NATION AND KATHY CLAMMY OF THE VERONA BAND OF MISSION INDIANS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE CONNECT US WITH KATHY. IS TWENTY NINTH ON BEHALF OF BROWN. YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO I AM KATHY CLEANING GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE BOROUGH IN THE BAND OF MISSION INDIANS AND ENROLLED MEMBER UPSET BLACKFEET NATION. CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES HAVE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OVER THEIR MEMBERS IN MY HAND AND THE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TODAY GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION IS ENCOURAGED UNDER STATE LAW WELL GOVERNOR NEWSOM REAFFIRMS THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO CONSULTATION IT'S A SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITH EACH NEW ADMINISTRATION. THIS BILL CODIFIES THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF COMMITMENT TO GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION ESTABLISHES A PROCESS AND DEDICATES THE OFFICIALS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPRESENTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER PROMISES LEADERSHIP TO CLARIFY THIS POLICY AND SECURE THIS COMMITMENT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ANY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER A I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE THE WRONG AT NAME WRITTEN DOWN WHO IS YOUR SECOND WITNESS CAROLINE BILL HUNTER RIGHT I'M FROM MIGRATED TO HE GREAT I'M MODERATE IF YOU CAN PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FROM ITS BILL HUNTER. THANK YOU. NEARLINE SHOULD BE OPEN. FOUNDED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNORS TO APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ALL CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS FOR THE MISTREATMENT OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S HISTORY. NINE YEARS PRIOR IN TWO THOUSAND TEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A SIMILAR RESOLUTION. THERE IS VALUE IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE WRONG DOING THE PAST THE WORDS FALL SHORT WHEN THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWED UP WITH INTENTIONAL ACTION TO REBUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND AB NINE TWENTY THREE DOES JUST THAT AND WILL REQUIRE HEADS OF STATE AGENCIES TO BE PROPERLY TRAINED AND GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE TRIBES IN ANY OTHER STATE AND STATE AGENCIES TO BENEFIT FROM BASIC CONSTRUCTION ON TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND TRIBAL CONSULTATION REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EXERCISE OF THE STATE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TRIED THEY MUST BE CONSULTED BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW EVEN THE MOST WELL MEANING POLICIES CAN CREATE FUTURE UNFORESEEN IMPACTS. THIS PAST YEARS WE PAID CRISIS AFTER CRISIS IT BECAME EVEN MORE OBVIOUS THE TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT EARLY ON BENEFITS ALL THE CALIFORNIA. FIRE SEASON YOU KNOW TODAY HE ITSELF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE L. AND YOU FIRE AND SUFFERED LOSSES. DUE TO THE CHAOS OF CRISIS TRIBES HAVE TO PROACTIVELY SEEK OUT INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AND IN MOST CASES HAVE TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. THIS WAS AVOIDABLE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES OF STATE AGENCIES ARE LED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED ON CONDUCTING MEANINGFUL TRIBAL CONSULTATION AND CONSIDER NATIVE AMERICANS WHEN THEY CREATE POLICIES. WE THANK ASSEMBLYMAN RONALDFOR AUTHORING EIGHTY NINE TO THREE AND ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS MOVE TOWARDS PROGRESS WE ARE YOU'RE ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSPELL HUNTER MODERATOR IF YOU COULD NOT PLEASE OPEN UP THAT LINE FOR ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AND EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

TOPICS BOBCAT. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DERAILMENTS THIS YEAR BUT AFTER UNITED AUBURN INDIAN COMMUNITY IN OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE- NOT OFFERING ANY TROUBLE CALIFORNIA STANDING PORTENTS OF RESPECTFUL AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION AND THE PROCESS. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL RISKS BUT INTENTIONALLY UNDERMINING THAT PROCESS- UNITED AUBURN IS ALSO VERY STRONGLY OPPOSED GIVING ANY AUTHORITY FOR CONSULTATION IN STATUTE. TO THE GOVERNOR'S-TRAVEL ADVISOR. AND WE HAVE HAD RECENT AT ABOUT HIGH. THOSE CONCERNS. I'M ESTATE IN THE BILL GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ALREADY ESTABLISHED A TRAVEL ADVISOR TO OVERSEE IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DEMONSTRATION AND TRIBES.

I ANYONE INTHE HEARING ROOM QUESTION TO TESTIFY IN EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION SEEN NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST ADDRESS IT AT THE- WAS THE CONCERN RAISED. BY A THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION THAT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS. COULD POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE SOME OF THE THINGS THE BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I DIDN'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THOSE ISSUES WERE BUT WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ACCEPT PRESS THERE WAS CONCERN HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU KNOW YOU SEE WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE FROM IN THE COUNTRY THIS IS VERY MUCH NEEDED AS A CONSULTATION. AND GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT I BELIEVE THE- SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION REALLY DIRECTED HIS CONCERNS TO AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE TRIBAL ADVISOR- FOR THE GOVERNOR HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT. THIS BILL BUILDS ON CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS TRAINING THE ADMINISTRATION ON THOSE THAT WORK WITH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF WHAT- CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE TO MAKE SURE THEY TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS OF IT. THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD THIS BILL AND WE HAVE AN OPEN POLICY THAT THOSE THAT ARE WILLING TO COME AND WORK WITH US ON SOME LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT BE AMENABLE WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT- HOWEVER I THINK THIS BILL FOCUSES ON. BUILDING ON GOVERNOR BROWN'S- EXECUTIVE ORDER AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO NOW TRAINED ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE KEY EMPLOYEES THAT THEN WOULD THAT WORK WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN THEIR FIELD AND KNOWLEDGE OF CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS BUT LACK THE KNOWLEDGE OF UNDERSTANDING TRUE. CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AND POLICIES THAT ARE THERE AND AS A FORMER- CHAIRMAN WE COULD ATTEST THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SO MANY YEARS AND YOU SEE THE SUPPORT OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES COMING FORWARD. THERE IS A FEW THERE'S- THE ONE THE SPEAKER THAT TALKED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES BUT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AND YOU'VE SEEN THE DIFFERENT BILLS AND THE TOPICS THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE FOR OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS THESE TOPICS HAVE GONE ABSENT. JUST LIKE IN THE ROOM THAT WE'RE IN TODAY THE SPANISH MISSIONARY PERIOD WAS JUST DESTRUCTIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN THE PEOPLE YET WE HAVE A ROOM DEDICATED TO THE MISSION SYSTEM. WHEN IS THE ISSUE GONNA COME FORWARD TO DEDICATE A ROOM TO THE CALIFORNIA DID PEOPLE.

UNLESS YOU EDUCATE PEOPLE ON OUR PERSPECTIVE AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE LIVED IN OUR PERSPECTIVE PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE BLACK OR UNDER SERVED AND YOU CAN'T TRULY UNDERSTAND IF YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AND PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND IT ONCE THEY HAVE TIME TO SPEND WITH PEOPLE AND HAVE TO TIME TO CONSULT WITH PEOPLE ON WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE SO I VERY MUCH SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE DOING I FEEL VERY STUPID THAT I NEVER NOTICE WHAT THIS.

THANK YOU WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE GOT A MOTION FOR MISTER MEDINA AND A SECOND FOR MR RODRIGUEZ MOTION IS TO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. YES I'M TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS PETRIE-NORRIS HI PETRIE-NORRIS I PATTERSON. BURKE BURKE I GREAT. LACKEY LACKEY I MEDINA MEDINA I RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I FIVE ZERO THAT PHYLLIS OUT AND LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON. MOVING ON THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST THAT MOVIE NINE TO FILE ITEM NINE AB SIX SIXTY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT GOOD TO SEE YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE STATE AGENCY BY RECYCLED CAMPAIGN- HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND CERTAINLY THE WORLD OF RECYCLING HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL AND QUITE FRANKLY IS STRUGGLING- A GREAT DEAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME. SO THIS BILL AB SIX SIXTY ONE WOULD UPDATE THE STATE'S RECYCLE. CONTENT STANDARDS WHENEVER THE STATE ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. AND I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT- WE- ARE USUALLY PRETTY GOOD ABOUT TRYING TO PUSH FOR THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO DO THAT- THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THE STATE GOVERNMENT DOES IT SHARE ALSO. VOWED TO MATCH WITH THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY SO THE BILL MAKES THAT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUY BACK PROGRAMME. OR THE STATED SHE BY RECYCLED CAMPAIGN- IT WILL CLARIFY THAT- SERVICE CONTRACTS ALSO SHOULD BE INCLUDED WHERE THE CONTRACTOR PURCHASES REPORTABLE. ARE RECYCLED ITEMS BOB IT IS ONE STEP WE CERTAINLY HAVE A URGENT CLIMATE CRISIS OUT THERE AND- MAKING SURE WE'RE ALL DOING OUR OUR SHARED TURN TO TRYING TO. IMPROVE OUR PURCHASE OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS IT MAKES SENSE THE STATE HAS AN ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER AND CAN HELP PUSH THE INDUSTRY TRIP FOR MORE RECYCLING- AND JOIN THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT WE SEEM TO PUSH REGULARLY TO DO THIS. OP NOW MATT HAPPY TO HAVE A HEIDI SANBORN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP. ACTION COUNCIL AND- NICK LAPIS THE- DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY FOR CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE ON THE LINE- TO BE WITNESSES TODAY. AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT MODERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE CONNECT. US WITH MS SANBORN. HELLO GARY YES. THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS I'M HEIDI SANBORN REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL CHURCH OF ACTION COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY. ARKET AUGMENTED BY PATCHING TOGETHER IS THAT IT IS THE CARROT NOT THE STICK TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL TO CLOSE THE LOOP. I WORK IN MATERIALS MANAGEMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS NOW SURE THE STATE WIDE COMMISSION ON RECYCLING MARKETS AND CURBSIDE RECYCLING AND EVEN PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT CAL RECYCLE IN THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT SECTION. DURING MY TIME IN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE LEARNED ONE SIMPLE TRUTH THIS MATERIAL FIVE MARKETS WE DO NOT HAVE A WEIGHT PROBLEM. THIS IS WHY THE RECYCLING COMMISSION ALSO ASKED THE LEGISLATURE IN A REPORT SUBMITTED IN DECEMBER TO PASS A BILL LIKE EIGHTY SIX SIX ONE. IMPROVE OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM AND REDUCE COSTS WE MUST STRIVE MARKETS AND SUPPORT. REMANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK RECYCLED AS OF. IT'S VOTING WITH YOUR DOLLARS. IT'S A STRONGER SIGNAL WE CAN SEND THE COMPANIES TO REWARD THEM FOR USING RECYCLED CONTENT IN THEIR PRODUCTS. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ARE VOTING WITH PUBLIC MONEY. AND WE SHOULD BE ALIGNING OUR MONEY WITH OUR MISSION. OUR STATED MISSION IS TO ACHIEVE A 75% DIVERSION RATE BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE CURRENTLY AT 37% CALIFORNIA BY THE LOT OF STUFF FROM PAPER PRODUCTS TO ELECTRONICS. IF WE USE TAXPAYERS MONEY WISELY TO VOTE WE WILL DRIVE MARKETS. CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH THE STATE AGENCY BY RECYCLE CAMPAIGN THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT IT IS WILDLY OUTDATED AND NEEDS. AN UPDATE SO THE BILL WILL DO THAT BY EXPANDING AND UPDATING THE LIST OF PRODUCTS COVERED ENSURING THAT RECYCLE CONTENT OF PRODUCTS IS UPDATED EVERY THREE YEARS. AND REQUIRING THE UPDATED LIST OF PRODUCTS TO BE ADDED TO THE STATE CONTRACTING MANUAL AND MORE. YOU CAN CLEAR I'VE WORKED WITH PAINT RECYCLERS IN CALIFORNIA. WERE PROMISED THAT THE STATE WOULD BUY RECYCLED PAINT. AND THEY NEVER RECEIVED THE PURCHASES THAT THEY PREDICT THAT. MY PARENTS USED TO TELL ME I WON'T ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I'M NOT WILLING TO DO MYSELF. ASK THE CALIFORNIA ADOPT THE SAME MANTRA. SHOULD NOT ASK OTHERS TO BUY RECYCLED WHEN WE'RE NOT WILLING TO DO IT OURSELVES. BUT IF YOU THE CARROT INSTEAD OF THE SIX I THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS LEADERSHIP AND- YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. SIX SIX ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SANBORN. MODERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE CONNECT US NOW WITH NICK LAPIS WHO'S JOINING US FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. CAPTION ENSURING COMMITTEE MEMBERS NECROPOLIS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- THE SO CALLED FAB RACK LAW WAS GROUNDBREAKING WHEN IT WAS FIRST PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. BY IDENTIFYING NUMBER DIANE EASTON. THE LAW WAS PASSED AT THE SAME TIME AS CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK WHICH PRODUCTION MANDATE ON LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS. IN ORDER TO HELP CREATE MARKETS FOR THE NEWLY RECYCLED MATERIAL- IT'S ALSO DESIGNED AS MENTIONED IN ANOTHER BILL A FEW BILLS BACK TO AVOID DEFORESTATION AND CONSERVE OTHER RESOURCES- THE BILL HAS BEEN A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES. AND HAS BEEN REFERENCED IN MULTIPLE LOCAL PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES THAT ARE TIED TO THE SOUNDTRACK PROGRAM- HOWEVER OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS SEVERAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE PROGRAM HAVE COME TO THE SURFACE. AND THIS BILL UPDATES FABRIC TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP. ONE IS THAT THE LIST OF PRODUCTS IS OUT OF DATE- CARPET FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE CONTEMPLATED IN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION BUT IT'S AN AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA RECYCLERS ARE READY AND WILLING TO STEP UP TO SUPPLY THE MATERIAL. SOME PRODUCT CATEGORIES ARE INCORRECTLY DESCRIBED IN THE LEGISLATION. ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND OF COMPOST COMPOST IS BY DEFINITION A RECYCLED CONTENT PRODUCT SO INCLUDING A MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENT FOR COMPOST NEVER REALLY MADE SENSE IT IS INCREASING THE USE OF RECYCLED COMPOST AND MULCH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- RANGING FROM S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO THE STATE DIVERSION LAWS. SO THIS BILL UPDATES THE METRIC TO THE MORE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT OF RECYCLED CONTENT PRODUCTS USED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SOIL AMENDMENTS OR EROSION CONTROL PRODUCTS. WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPOST USED IS THE APPROPRIATE METRIC. AND FINALLY THERE'S BEE A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT- IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM IT REALLY IS NO PROCESS IN PLACE TO HAVE A STRONG FEEDBACK LOOP FOR- AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE TO COME UP. TO THEIR APARTMENTS AND COME UP AND COMPLIANCE. AND THIS BILL UPDATE SETTING CREATES A MECHANISM FOR BOTH DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND COUNTERCYCLICAL. TO HELP GET STATE AGENCIES ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AS HEIDI MENTIONED- THESE CHANGES OF IDENTIFIED BY THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION ON RECYCLING MARKETS AND CURBSIDE DEVELOPMENT. KERBSIDE RECYCLING I APOLOGIZE- BECAUSE THEY AE REALLY LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA RECYCLING AND CREATING AND STATE JOBS. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE DRIVE VOTE AND WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER LAPIS AND WE TO HAVE ONE- PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. MODERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE CONNECT US WITH MARK PETS WHO IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FOREST AND PAPER ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MARKETS AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE AMERICAN PART THE PAPERS EDUCATION SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF AB SIX SIX ONE. HEY CAN BE A REPRESENTS MANUFACTURERS OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF EIGHTY SIX SIX ONE. WE SUPPORT PROCUREMENT POLICIES ADVANCED PRODUCT AVAILABILITY BUT OUR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT WE MAKE. BUT EIGHTY SIX SIX ONE WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE ENVIRONMENTAL ATTACKS THAN INTENDED. THE COMMON PERCEPTION THAT INCREASING THE USE OF RECOVERED PAPER TRANSLATES INTO BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES IS FLAWED. THERE'S NO DEBATE THAT DIVERTING PAPER FROM LANDFILL AND RECOVERING IT COULD RE USE AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS HOWEVER THE BENEFITS OF REPLACING BURKE CHEN PARTNER WITH RECYCLED FIBER IN PAPER PRODUCTS CAN VARY WIDELY DEPENDING ON THE MANUFACTURING METHODS. IN THE PRODUCTS PRODUCED. TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE MINIMUM POST CONSUMER CONTENT. AND PUTTING PAPER INCREASE WOULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAPER QUALITY AND HOW FICKLE. WORKS ALONG THE GROUND. PUTTING PAPER FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY HIGH ON THE QUALITY PYRAMID OF PAPER IT'S BRIGHT WHITE AND CLEAN AND REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY INPUTS. THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN PARTS RECOVERED FIBRE STREAM THAT COULD BE USED CONNECT PUTTING PAPER FOR EXAMPLE FULL CORRUGATED CONTAINERS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR MAKING PUTTING PAPERS BUT THEY ALSO REPRESENT OVER 70% OF RECOVERED BY THE NEXT. AT LEAST TALK TO MAKE HIGH QUALITY PRINTING PAPERS POST CONSUMER RECOVERED FIBER IS THE MOST CONTAMINATED AND REQUIRES THE MOST PROCESS INTENSITY OF ALL THE COVERAGE BY WITH BAILABLE TRIBUTES- ALSO QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE TRADEOFFS THAT OCCUR WHEN BERGEN FIVE ALREADY PLAGUED BY RESTOCKING WATER. RECYCLED FIBERS OF SHORTER WE CARE LESS ABSORBENT AND NOT AS TO THE VIRGIN BIRTH FRESH FIBER. THE RESULT OF EIGHTY SIX SIX ONE WOULD BE TO FORCE POST CONSUMER RECOVERED FIBRE IN PRETTY PAPER WHEN THAT VERY FIBER COULD BE USED MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVELY AND WITH THE LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT. OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE PACKAGES THAT DON'T REQUIRE SUCH HIGH QUALITY INPUTS. THE POST CONSUMER DISTINCTION IS ALSO A LEGACY TERM THAT SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. SINGLING OUT POST CONSUMER FIBER IS PRESUMABLY BETTER PARDON ARE MAINLY SUPERIOR TO OTHER RECOVERED FIBER IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN CREATED DISTORTED VIEW OF THE ADVANTAGES OF USING RECYCLED FIBER. TODAY'S COLLECTION OF RECOVERED PAPER MIXES BOTH PRE AND POST CONSUMER MATERIAL TOGETHER MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF POST CONSUMER CONTENT IN RECOVERED PAPER THAT ARRIVES AT PAPER MILLS. THAT'S A KEY REASON WHY BOTH MAJOR THIRD PARTY- CHAIN OF CUSTODY CERTIFICATION STANDARDS OF PAPER PRODUCTS THAT THAT THAT'S THE PATH THAT BY ELIMINATED THE POST CONSUMER AT THE DESIGNATION IN FAVOR OF RECYCLED CONTENT. FURTHERMORE THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND MOST EFFICIENT PART OF THE RECOVERED FIBRE MIXED USE THE BIG COMPLAINING PAPER BASED ON CREDITS CRAP THAT WE CALL HOPE SUBSTITUTES. THIS IS PAPER THAT NEED NO SORTING HARDEST PROCESSING CAN BE DIRECTLY FED INTO A PAPER MACHINE SB SIX SIX ONE WITH ELIMINATE THIS RAW MATERIAL INPUT BECAUSE. IT IS NOT CONSIDERED CLOSE CONSUMER. SACRAMENTO FAX ALSO NEED CONSISTENT TO MAKE PAPER INSPECTION BUT- I THOUGHT PEOPLE FOR PAPER MANUFACTURERS TO DESIGN PRODUCTS COMMITTEE BALTIMORE RECYCLE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON STATE. FEDERAL PROCUREMENT FOR TISSUE AND POWER PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE ALIGNED WITH THE GREEN SEAL CERTIFICATION STANDARDS WHICH INCLUDES A MULTI STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THAT CONSIDERS BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS WELL AS PRODUCT PERFORMANCE WAITED A RECYCLED MINIMUM CONTENT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EFFECTS ON STRENGTHENING ABSORBENCY OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCTS. ALIGNING WITH THE GREENVILLE STANDARDS FOR SANITARY PRODUCTS WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. IN SUMMARY WHILE WELL INTENDED SB SIX SIX ONE IS CHECKING YESTERDAY'S ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AND NOT RECOGNIZING TODAY'S RECYCLING THE ELEPHANT'S. POLICIES THAT MANDATE RECYCLE CONTENT MAY BE HELPFUL TO JUMP START RECYCLING FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE LOW IN RECOVERY RATES BUT NOT APPROPRIATE FOR PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER RATES AND ROBUST MARKETS THAT IS THE CASE. FOR PAPER PRODUCTS. BUT ARBITRARILY RAISING THE MINIMUM POST CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT IN CERTAIN PAPER PRODUCTS EIGHTY SIX SIXTY ONE BUT ACTUALLY INCREASE WAIST. CRAZY ENERGY CONSUMPTION MUCH OF WHICH COMES FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND INCREASE MANUFACTURING COST. RECYCLING MATERIAL THAT COULD BE PUT TO GREATER AND MORE EFFICIENT USE THAT OTHER PAPER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PAPER BOXES AND CONTAINERBOARD BECAUSE OF THE VOCAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER PETS A MODERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WISHING TO SPEAK CAN EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

HIS DETAILED DIVE INTO THAT THE WORLD OF PAPER AND QUALITY AND HOW THAT. HOW THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR A PROPOSAL SUCH AS THIS. NOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THIS BILL IS UPDATING PRODUCTS AND MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT PERCENTAGES AS DETERMINED TO BE APPROPRIATE WHICH WOULD BEGIN ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THERE WILL BE A PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THEIR STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS CORRECT. YES YES END DATE THE ISSUES THAT HE BROUGHT UP WERE FAIRLY TECHNICAL AND FAIRLY NARROW ABOUT YOU KNOW PERFECTLY RECYCLED AND- WE CERTAINLY ARE ARE PRETENDING THAT WE CAN WITH THIS BILL IDENTIFY ALL OF THE SPECIFICS IN THE COMPLICATED WORLD OF RECYCLING AND ETCETERA NOR CAN WE ANTICIPATE ALL THE CHANGES SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL SETS UP EVERY THREE YEAR UPDATING SO THAT WE DON'T GET OURSELVES IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW- AND- CERTAINLY IT WE ARE CERTAINLY WILLING TO ENTERTAIN AMENDMENTS IF- THERE AMENDMENTS SO FAR WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY- ANY AMENDMENT SUGGESTIONS. TO ADDRESS ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT HELLO THIS BILL DOES THE STANDARDS THAT ARE ADOPTED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE FEDERAL EPA STANDARDS OF BECAUSE IT SEEMS BEST FOR US TO STAY CONSISTENT IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR EVERYBODY IN THE RECYCLING MARKET- TO WORK IF WE HAVE A COMMON STANDARD- NATIONALLY- THAT IS OUT THERE SO AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE TO AGENCIES THAT WILL BE DIRECTED TO SORT OF COORDINATE ALL THE RULE MAKING. ON THIS AND THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT RULEMAKING THAT WILL WILL HAVE TO HAVE TO TAKE PLACE AND THAT'LL TAKE PLACE OFCOURSE WITH ALL OF THE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC COMMENT X. CENTER THAT GOES FOR WITH OTHER RULEMAKINGS HI THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO SORT OF START THAT WHOLE PROCESS- AND SORT OF BRING IT BACK UP TO SPEED WITH THE EPA STANDARDS AS WE KNOW THEM NOW BUT RECOGNIZING THEIR STILL QUITE A BIT OF- SUCH SPECIFIC WORK THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND ALSO THAT YOU DID MENTION SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO PUT I THINK IN OUR INITIAL COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE HAD MENTIONED THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT BOB WE'D NO LONGER THINK THE BILL NEEDS TO BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS ALREADY A PART OF THAT THE PROCESSOR I WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT AND THAT AND THANK YOU FOR IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE COMMITMENT FOR CONTINUING CHANGE ENGAGE WITH.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M DELIGHTED TO BRING AB NINE THIRTY FOR YOU AND THIS ACTUALLY RELATES TO IN A BACK DOOR SOARED AWAY WITH THE ANNEX PROJECT THE PIECE OF THEIR NEXT PROJECT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD AT THIS POINT AND IT'S A SECURITY CONVERSATION. I STARTED THE SECURITY CONVERSATION VERY VERY EARLY BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IF WE WAITED THE LAST MINUTE TO DO WHAT'S ISSUES OF SECURITY. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE IN HAVE A LOT OF CHANGE ORDERS AND THEY WERE JUST SAID THE COST OF THE ROOF. THIS BILL BENEFITS THAT SAME PATTERN THIS DEALS WITH SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT NOT A SHELTER IN PLACE IN A BUILDING. EDIT ASK TEACHERS TO DO A STUDY AND BRING FORTH GUIDELINES ON HOW WE SHOULD DEAL WITH SHELTER IN PLACE. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ISN'T THERE FOR ANOTHER STUDY BILL. BUT THE ROLE OF THIS STUDY BILL IS TO GET ON EVERYONE'S RADAR SCREEN WHAT ARE GOOD PRACTICES ON CHILDREN PLACE. SO AS WE ARE DEVELOPING PLANS FOR BUILDINGS REFERRED INTEGRATED IN EARLY. AND THAT MAKES US LESS EXPENSIVE SHORT IN A PLACE IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT THERE ARE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF IT. THE RESULT IN PLACE IN NEW CONSTRUCTION. WHICH CAN DEAL WITH SUCH THINGS AS- THE IDEA IS IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS. WHERE CAN YOU GET TO. SO THIS IS NOT A NEW CONVERSATION SINCE JANUARY SIX ON JANUARY SIX IT MAKES US ALL THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY. R. BUT IT'S WHAT IS THE WHAT MAKES FOR A SHELTER IN PLACE WHAT SORT OF RESILIENCE TO THAT PART OF THE BUILDING NEED TO HAVE. TO DEAL WITH RESISTANCE ARE THERE SYSTEMS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. ALARM SYSTEMS. IS THERE SOME NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF. BATHROOMS OR WATER OR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THESE ARE ALL ELEMENTS TO KIND OF FIT INTO. A NEW CONSTRUCTION. IT'S ALSO RELEVANT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A PROJECT AROUND. OLDER MORE VULNERABLE CONSTRUCTION. HOW CAN PEOPLE GET FROM A FOLDER STRUCTURE INTO A- SAFE AND SECURE PLACE. WHERE PEOPLE THE NOTED GO LOOK. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. SO THIS IS- IT IS A SMALL TOPIC BUT I THINK IT'S ONE THAT'S PER MUCH AFFECT WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. AS WE ARRIVED HERE IS MEMBERS CENTERS ARE STAFFERS YOUNG PEOPLE IT IS SORT OF THE PUZZLE PALACE FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THIS BUILDING IS CONFUSING. BUT PITY THE POOR PUBLIC CREWS HERE. YOU KNOW CAN'T SEE A WINDOW CAN'T ORIENT THEMSELVES POLITE.

THAT IS THE ISSUE I'M DELIGHTED TO BRING IT FORWARD I THANK YOU FOR THE- MOTION AND THE SECOND HOMES AND IS DESIGNED NOT TO JUST ASK DID YOU HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL BUT TO TAKE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY OF WHAT FEMA HAS DONE. THERE IS OUTSTANDING WORK BUT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING AND- BEEN IN THE WEEDS ON FOR SOME YEARS. FEMA US DEPARTMENT STATE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HOME SECURITY THEY'VE ALL DONE SORT OF WORK. SOLVE THE PUZZLE OF HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE IS NOT AS MURKY. AS IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST A- A GOOD TIME FOR CALIFORNIA WEATHER APARTMENT.

FIVE ZERO THAT FELL OUT AND LEAVE THE WORLD EVENTS THANK YOU AND THAT WE'VE GOT MORE MOVING NOW ON TO FILE ITEM THIRTEEN A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX- REINTRODUCTION OF AB THIRTY TO FIFTEEN FROM LAST YEAR THAT WAS PARKED DUE TO. OUR A BILL LIMITS. OF THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH A PERMANENT STATE COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE. AND IS INSPIRED BY THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE STATE OF HATE THAT I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF CHAIRING SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW. WHEN I SAY THAT HATE CRIMES ARE INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TRAGICALLY THESE HATE CRIMES ARE BECOMING MORE VIOLENT AND MORE DEADLY WITH RECORDED INCREASES IN HATE RELATED HOMICIDES AND VIOLENT ASSAULTS. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM IS TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TO THE NATION. HATE CRIME TOTALS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN HIT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER A DECADE WITH SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN HATE CRIME INCIDENTS REPORTED. FBI DATA REVEALS THAT TWENTY NINETEEN WAS ALSO THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR HATE CRIMES WITH FIFTY ONE MURDERS A MORE THAN EIGHTEEN. TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO MARKED THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR THAT HATE CRIME. OTHER THE HATE CRIME METRIC SURPASSED SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED INCIDENTS AND IT WAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE THE FBI REPORTED. SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE INCIDENTS AND TWENTY AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. ANTI SEMITIC HATE CRIMES ROSE 14% FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. IN THE SAME TIME FRAME ANTI LATINO HATE CRIMES ROSE EIGHT POINT 7% AND ANTI ARAB HATE CRIMES ROSE SIXTEEN PERCENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY ANTI AGING ASIAN. HATE CRIMES SURGED BY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PERCENT. AND HATE CRIMES AGAINST GAY MEN JUMPED NEARLY TRANSGENDER HATE CRIMES ROSE ABOUT 26% BLACK PEOPLE REMAIN THE NUMBER ONE TARGET FOR HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA AT TWICE THE LEVEL THEY REPRESENT IN THE POPULATION. WELL WE HAVE SOME DATA ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF HATE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING PERPETRATED EXPERTS SAY THAT THE FBI DATA LIKELY UNDERCOUNTS THE NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA. BOTH BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS FAILED TO REPORT INCIDENTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT HATE CRIME DATA TO THE FBI. THE FBI IT RELIES ON THE VOLUNTARY REPORTING OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND. PARTICIPATING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS TE COUNTRY LAST YEAR 86% OF THEM DID NOT REPORT A SINGLE HATE CRIME. INCLUDING AT LEAST SEVENTY ONE CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCORDING TO THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE THE SIKH COALITION AND OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS. DUE TO THE STAGGERING STATISTICS AND CHALLENGES OF MONITORING COLLECTING AND ANALYZING THIS DATA IT'S CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS BETTER TOOLS AND DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS TO HELP US TRACK AND REPORT THIS INFORMATION. THE COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE WILL MONITOR AND ASSESS CURRENT TRENDS RELATIVE TO HATE CRIMES PRODUCE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THESE TRENDS AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. IN ORDER TO HELP THE STATE BE AWARE OF ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY REDUCE INSTANCES OF THESE CRIMES. THE COMMISSION WILL ALSO HOST COMMUNITY FORMS IN ORDER TO ENGAGE AND INFORM THE PUBLIC ON CURRENT TRENDS AND RECEIVE COMMUNITY FEEDBACK. THE COMMISSION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHO IS PERPETRATING THESE CRIMES WHO IS BEING TARGETED AND HOW WE CAN DEVELOP MOST IMPORTANTLY I WOULD SAY. HOW WE CAN DEVELOP POLICY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THE INSTANCES OF THESE CRIMES. AND PLEASED TO HAVE PROFESSOR BRIAN LEVIN DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM AT CSU SAMBAR TO DINO AND MA HA ALGONA ID.

OCT TWO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND IN THE SAME ORGANIZATION OVER SIXTY ONE HUNDRED CASES. WERE REPORTED THAT INCLUDED HATE CRIMES DISCRIMINATION BULLYING IN SCHOOLS.

REACHED NINE ELEVEN OUT LEVELS. AND YOU WERE FROM HATE CRIMES ALSO FOLLOW INTERNATIONAL NEWS ABOUT WARS- THAT YOU THAT THE US IS INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERROR ATTACKS OR ATTACKS. ON MOSQUES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WILL BE TO HATE CRIMES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN LIGHT OF EMERGING TRENDS. IN IN THE IN THE RISE IN WHITE ETHNO NATIONALISM HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD AND HATE SPEECH BY THE RIGHT. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE CRIED WILL BE UPDATED SOON ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE PHENOMENAL CALLED ISLAMOPHOBIA WHICH IS ANTI MUSLIM RACISM. ISLAMOPHOBIA IS A WIDE ACROSS MANY AND SOCIETY THAT IN SCHOOL HIGHER EDUCATION MEDIA HOLYWOOD VIDEO GAMES SOCIAL MEDIA. ESPECIALLY INTERNET WEBSITE AND OF COURSE IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGNWE ALSO HAVE THE ISLAMOPHOBIA INDUSTRY THAT IS FUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
