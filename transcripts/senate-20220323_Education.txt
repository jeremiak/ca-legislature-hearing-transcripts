I WANT TO THANK HIM- SO I'M PRESENTING SP NINE FOUR ONE WHICH ADDRESSES- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN- EXACERBATED THROUGH THE- THROUGH COVERT. WITH A SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS I IN PARTICULAR IN STEM CLASSES AND DUAL LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS- SOME SCHOOLS. STRUGGLE TO FIND- TEACHERS AND HAD TO CANCEL CLASSES WHICH DISRUPTED THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT OF THE PARENTS OF TWO KILLER. I IN THE DUAL LANGUAGE CLASSES SO. STUDENTS HAVE FACED UNPRECEDENTED TIMES IN THIS RUCTIONS AS WE KNOW SO WHEN THE NOT COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC STARTED. CALIFORNIA WAS ALREADY EXPERIENCING A DECLINING NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN SCHOOL YEAR. 80% OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS REPORTED SHORTAGES. OF QUALIFIED CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. SHORTAGES ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN RURAL AREAS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW SO KIDS SOCIOECONOMIC. FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUB STANDARD LEARNING OUTCOMES ARE LIKELY TO REVERBERATE. THROUGH FUTURE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. A RECENT REPORT BY THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE FOUND THAT. THE MOST PRONOUNCED SHORTAGES INCLUDED. TEACHERS FOR MATHS SCIENCE AND BILINGUAL EDUCATION. THIS IS FORCING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CANCEL CLASSES OR SEEK EMERGENCY EMERGENCY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS WHICH FRANKLY NO ONE. WANTS TO SEE. ON ALTERNATIVE. THE CLASS CANCELLATIONS ARE EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS IS TO ALLOW INTERDISTRICT COLLABORATIONS. WHERE STUDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN ANOTHER DISTRICTS CLASS. WITHOUT HAVING TO UNROLL THEM. FROM THAT CURRENT DISTRICT. THE PRONOUNCE YOUR TO OF STEMMING A LANGUAGE AND TEACHERS. MAY SICKNESS TO FIND TO. AND ALLOWING DISTRICTS TO COLLABORATE- SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL STEP. SOME FOLKS HAVE SAID WEISS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IN ORDER FIRST STUDENTS TO BE RELEASED FROM SCHOOL SIR SOMETIMES CAN BE A BURDENSOME PROCESS HAVING TO GO THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION HAVING TO DO. A FULL TIME RELEASED THIS LET'S DISTRICTS COLLABORATE SO TODAY I HAVE WITH ME- DIANA BOO FROM THE ACCESS WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY AND J'MON MOORE WHO IS A PARENT IN THE PASADENA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE.

CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN DO YOU KNOW THE STRUGGLES THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING ON PREPARE THEM AGAIN AND- THAT THE PANDEMIC. HIGHLIGHTED STUDY STUDENTS SPEND ALMOST ONE THIRD OF THEIR LIVES AT SCHOOL. AND IN MANY CASES SCHOOL FOR THEIR ONLY ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE. FORTY JACKSON A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVE RECEIVING THE CARE THEY NEED. AND MANY STUDENTS MAY NOT HAVE OTHER AVENUES OF CARE. TWO THIRDS OF TEACHERS SAY THEY WERE UNEQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THEIR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH. TWENTY TWENTY REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION FOUND THAT ONE IN THREE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED FEELING CHRONICALLY. SAD AND HOPELESS ONE IN THREE. FRANKLY SAD AND HOPELESS WITH THE NUMBER RISING MORE THAN HALF FOR LGBT STUDENTS. ONE IN SIX HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED HAVING CONSIDERED SUICIDE IN THE PAST YEAR AND ONE IN THREE LGBT STUDENTS. HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PRESSING FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO'VE ALREADY FACE DISPARITIES IN CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION. EXPANDING WELLNESS CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MEET THE GROWING NEEDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE MONTH OUR STUDENTS. PRIORITIZING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS AT A CRUCIAL TIME IS KEY FOR LONG TERM WELL BEING AN ACADEMIC SUCCESS. UNADDRESSED ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND TRAUMA CAN IMPACT FUTURE WELL BEING AN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AS WELL AS INCREASING DEMANDS ON SOCIAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. TODAY I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL TO EXPAND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON OUR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. I HAVE- MICHELLE NEW ONE- PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY BASED IN LA. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ONE FOR FREE THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO A MEMBERS I'M JUST GOING TO ASK TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOM YOUR MIKE IS ON AND YOU SPEAK DIRECTLY INTO IT- FOLKS LISTENING TO HIM A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME HEARING.

OKAY WE ARE GOING TO GO TO YOUR LEAD WITNESS- DOCTOR NEW LAN BUTTON THE ONLY IF YOU'RE READY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS DR MICHELLE KNEELAND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES I'M A RESIDENT. OF PASADENA CALIFORNIA. OVER EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES OF LIVING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THERE. THERE HAS BEEN A 24% INCREASE. IN MENTAL HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS FOR FIVE TO ELEVEN YEAR OLD. AND A 31% INCREASE FOR TWELVE TO SEVEN YEAR OLD SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. FOR PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TEN AND TWENTY FOUR. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN A 50% JUMP IN SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AMONG YOUNG GIRL. AND A 4% JUMP FOR BOYS. I AM HERE TO VOICE OUR SUPPORT OF SENATOR PORTANTINO'S SB THIRTY TO THIRTEEN OH TWO. TO FUND WELLNESS CENTERS AND OTHER VITAL LIFESAVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOL. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS RECOMMENDS A RATIO OF ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. FOR FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. CURRENT DAY AFTER AND NATIONAL. OF ONE TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN. OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS FAILING OUR CHILDREN. NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION AND FUNDING IS BEING GIVEN TO DIE RECHTE SERVICES IN SCHOOL AS WELL AS TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THREE YEARS AGO I PERSONALLY TRIED TO HELP THE PRINCIPAL AND STUDENTS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MIDDLE SCHOOL WHO ARE FACING AN ALARMING INCREASE IN LOSS OF LIFE TO SUICIDE FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. BUT AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WE WERE PREVENTED FROM HELPING THE STUDENTS BECAUSE OF LEGAL AND BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES THE OUTCOME LOSS OF LIFE. IN THE END THE PRINCIPAL AND STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL DID NOT RECEIVE THE URGENT SUPPORT THAT THEY REQUIRE. THE CHICAGO SCHOOL IS CURRENTLY TRAINING ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF OUR STUDENTS WORKING IN COMMUNITY BASED CLINICS AND SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING FREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS PART OF THEIR TRAINING. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO IT IS NOT ENOUGH I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT TO THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF OUR MOST PRECIOUS COMMODITY WHICH IS OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE WILL NOW COME TO TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND IT ANYBODY IN HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF S. B. THIRTEEN OH TWO. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. NINE SIXTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MORNING MY NAME IS JEFF WEINER I'M CALLING IN FROM JEWISH FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES IN THAT AREA- WE DO CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH WORK WITH CHILDREN AND WE ALSO WORK WITH THEIR PARENTS AND TEACHERS TO SUPPORT THEM AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME. AND THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD AND YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE- WE'VE SEEN A HUGE GROWTH IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND PARENTS ARE COMING TO US WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE ISOLATION FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR SOCIAL SUPPORT IS AFFECTING STUDENTS ACROSS THE BOARD ALL STUDENTS. NOT JUST THE ONES WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE RETURNING TO IN PERSON OR NAY. ALMOST ALL OF THEM WILL HAVE FACE SOME LEVEL OF ADVERSITY. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF EVERY STUDENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO MIGHT NEED. TO BE REFERRED TO MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT. COOL WELLNESS CENTER MEET THAT. BECAUSE THEY ARE STATE PLACE WHERE STUDENT GO TO DECOMPRESS AND IF THEY WISH. TO TALK TO A COUNSELOR OR ANOTHER TRAINED PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH. AND IF THE LOW STAKES ASPECT OF WELLNESS CENTERS THE ACCESSIBILITY THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WELCOMING. PLACES FOR ANY STUDENTS TO COMMENT THAT MAKES THEM ATTRACTIVE FOR THE WIDEST RANGE OF KIDS. AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING AND REACHING THIS LARGE GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE ON RECOGNIZE TRAUMA FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS. AS I SAID WELL THIS CENTERS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL HERE ONE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS THAT HELP KIDS BE RESILIENT. AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE REFERRALS AND LINKAGES TO MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES- AND AT PRESENT A LOT OF USER I'M ARTICULATED WRAP UP YOU WERE REALLY ONLY SUPPOSED TO STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR SUPPORT BY LETTING YOU GO ON BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A SECOND LEAD SUPPORT. NO SAW JUST WRAP UP BY SAYING THIS BUILDING MINUTES GO WELL CENTERS WITH THE SAN. AND FOR THAT REASON I URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

A SENATOR PAM. BUT THANK YOU SIR I'M- AND I DON'T KNOW I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR- YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING HEALTH WANT ONE THINGS I DID WANT TO MAKE NOTE IS THAT- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT ACTUALLY NEAR TIMES ACTUALLY REPORTED. RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY IN CHILDREN WERE RISING BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND I KNOW THAT- THERE PORTANTINO YOU AND WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON ACTUALLY DRESSING MEDICAL ISSUES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF THIS. SO YOU CERTAINLY VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS- YOU KNOW- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE PANDEMIC- WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH HELPING SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR- CHILDREN OF OUR STUDENTS AND SCHOOL AND SO FORTH. I GUESS JUST ONE BRIEF QUESTION AND THEN OF COURSE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MOVE IT TO STOP THE PROTAGONIST AT. THIS ONE TIME MONEY OR DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU SEE BECAUSE WILL YOU STAND UP THE WELLNESS CENTER- HOW DO I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TO SUSTAIN THEM. IT'S ACTUALLY MY HOPE IT'S ACTUALLY MY HOPE. THAT IT WOULD BE AN ON GOING. EXCELLENT WELL AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL TO PUT THE TIME AND THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PANAMINT GO TO CENTRO CHAU BOGAN AND CENTERPLATE. BUT THE MORE AND THANK YOU CENTER PROJECT FOR- BRING THIS BILL FOURTH. YOU% KNOW AS A NEW MEMBER TO THE LEGISLATURE- AS OF LAST YEAR MEANING WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE IT IS. MIND BOGGLING THE AMOUNT OF CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE HUMOR HEALTH AND MANY MANY SPACES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND I AM JUST I'M- VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS HOPEFULLY WILL GO FORTH AND MOVE FORWARD AND ADDRESS EACH OF THEIR CHILDREN- I MYSELF HAVE KNOWN. JUST ONE FAMILY MEMBER WHO- YOU KNOW WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS ATTEMPTED SUICIDE- IN A IT WAS HEARTBREAKING HEARTBREAKING SO AND IT'S IT. IT'S PERSONAL FOR ME AND- I THINK FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ONE THING I DID WANT TO MENTION REALLY QUICK IS THE- MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE PROBLEMS. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE BUT NOT JUST THAT THAT AS ELECTED. WE WORK ON POLICY THAT HELPS SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE HEALTHY BEGINNING WITH THE PARENTS- AND THE CARE GIVERS BECAUSE WE ARE. CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S REALLY IN MY OPINION MY PERSONAL HUMBLE OPINION BASED ON MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE TO ROUTE MY DISTRICT. THAT'S VERY HOSTILE TO FAMILIES AND EXPECTING PARENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA- IN PROVIDING THAT QUALITY OF LIFE IT'S BECOMING VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO I'M HOPING THAT AS ELECTED. AS LEADERS IN WHICHEVER SPACE WERE WORKING WHETHER IT'S LOCAL OR AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE WORK TOWARDS- POLICY THAT BRINGS HOW MANY WITHIN OUR FAMILIES. AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WITHIN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION BECAUSE- GOODNESS GRACIOUS WE'RE IN TROUBLE AND MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT WEIGHT- WITHIN THEIR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND IT AFFECTS THEIR- PHYSICAL WELL BEING THEIR EMOTIONAL AND EVEN THEIR SPIRITUAL. SO ON THAT FRONT I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT HIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTRO CHOI BOGUE. CENTER GLAZER PORTANTINO I THROUGH THE ONE TO ADD MY VOICE AT STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE LEGISLATION. IT'LL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAT. THE NUMBER THAT WE TAKE ACTION IN THE SPACE- THIS YESTERDAY PROVIDE NUMBER BY STAFF WHO. HAD A FAMILY FOR THAT PERSON SCHOOL. BY AND WE KNOW THAT IS JUST THAT WERE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER LAST YEAR ON BY. EIGHT TO FOURTEEN BOND MEASURE TO ADD I HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS IN FOR. THIS TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS WE DON'T KNOW THAT WITH THAT BILL IS GOING TO GO WITH THEM ASSEMBLY AND WHAT KIND OF ISSUE SHOULD. RESULTS IN ITS- OF PASSAGE OR NOT. BUT I CERTAINLY SEE THIS AS ANOTHER. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT TIME THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS SENATE ALL. TO GIVE YOU AN OFFER TO THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE ALL THERE'S LOT OF MY AND I'M- WE SPOKE EARLIER- BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN I WHEN YOU'VE GOT. YOU KNOW WE PUT MONEY IN CALIFORNIA TO A LOT OF THINGS A LOT OF MONEY. SO CAN YOU L. NIGHT EXPERIENCE IN MY DISTRICT- THE LACK OF EVEN THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE WORKERS EVEN IF WE HAVE THE MONEY SO THIS IS VERY BROAD AND- AND WHEN HE CAN YOU JUST SHARE YOUR VISION ON HOW YOU. SEE THIS ROLLING OUT AND WHAT AND WHAT AREAS ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO FILL THOSE SLOTS AND WITH WHAT KIND OF- PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FILL THOSE ACTUAL SLOTS TO GET THE JOB DONE- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE LEFT. THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS I RECOGNIZE. PERSONAL I WANT TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUES- FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND FOR THE CONVERSATION I MEAN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT SUBJECT. WE LEFT IT BROAD BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. COUNTY TO COUNTY WITH THE SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY AND NEEDED- ONE SCHOOL MAY NEED A PHYSICAL SPACE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE. SUFFICIENT COUNSELORS AND OTHER SCHOOL MAY. NEED ONE TYPE OF ACUTE. HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SO WE SORT OF CREATED A MENU. OF OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS AND- WE THINK IN ORDER. TO MAKE. THE H. STRONG DIFFERENCE ON A CAMPUS. WE NEEDED TO HAVE. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. HIGH SCHOOL BY HIGH SCHOOL SO THAT'S WHY. IN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS WE THINK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CAMPUS. WILL WILL DO. THE JOB- WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY- VARIOUS DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSED IN THE FISCAL COMMITTEE- BUT YOU ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. IN THIS THE CHICAGO SCHOOL MENTIONED. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MANY STUDENTS THROUGH. THE PIPELINE AS POSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS TO TRY TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. BECAUSE THERE IS A RECOGNITION IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH THE SYSTEM- WITH THEIR CERTIFICATES WITH THE TRAINING. SOONER QUICKER FASTER BECAUSE THE NEED IS SO GREAT- THE BILL IS NOT ADDRESSING THAT PIECE BECAUSE OTHER LEGISLATION IS. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BE BROAD ENOUGH AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO GIVE DISTRICTS THE ABILITY TO MEET THE DEMANDS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I AND YOU KNOW. WE WORKED ON THAT LAST YEAR GIVING THE- ACTUAL TRAINING FOR TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY. WHERE THERE IS GOING TO- WHEN THEY- THE ACTUAL TRANSFERRED SO THEY CAN SEE IT BEFORE IT HAPPENS AND SO AND I KNOW THAT BILL GOT HUNG UP IN THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR AND DIDN'T GET OUT AND SO. I'M HOPING THIS IS KIND OF ALONG THOSE LINES WERE WEAK WE CAN EDUCATE. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY THE TEACHER BUT THE BUS DRIVERS IN THE IN THE FOLKS ALONG THE WAY THIS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHEN THEY SEE A STUDENT THAT IS- ISOLATING THEMSELVES OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND GET IT GOING TOWARDS THAT PATH OF- YOU NEEDING SOME COUNSELING YEAH. EARLIER THAN LATER SOONER THAN LATER SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY A BIG GONNA BE REALLY WATCHING FOR THE DETAIL OF HOW IT COMES OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE IMPORTANT PART. OF HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED IN NOT JUST THE MONEY PART OF IT BUT ACTUALLY HOW IT WORKS ON THE GROUND SO I APPRECIATE YOU STAYING ON THE FOCUS OF THIS AND I THINK THERE IS IT A TRUE NEED FOR. AND MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY- THE FISCAL QUESTION AND THE STABILITY OF THE PROGRAM MATTERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE BEST THING IS TO HAVE WELL TRAINED. COUNSELLORS SOCIAL WORKERS ON CAMPUS YEAR IN YEAR OUT YOU KNOW IT WHO WORK FOR THE DISTRICT OF AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR. IS TO HAVE THAT STABILITY IN THE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T EVEN THOUGH THE STUDENTS CHANGE EVERY YEAR THEIR DEMANDS DON'T GO AWAY THEY NEED THAT TABILITY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL. ARE YOU ALSO REFERENCED THE TRAINING THE OTHER FOLKS ON CAMPUS THAT'S VERY COMPANION TO THIS IS IF THE TEACHER THE BUS DRIVER THE CAFETERIA WORKER IS TRAINED TO SEE THE WARNING SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THEN THEY CAN% DIRECT THAT STUDENT. TO THAT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL WHO WOULD ALSO BE ON THAT CAMPUS SO THEY WORKING COMPLEMENT TO EACH OTHER THE KEY IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT STABLE. WHICH REQUIRES THE FUNDINGAND THEN TO HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT'S ABLE TO DO THE JOB ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND SO THAT'S THE OVERALL GOAL SO THANK YOU. WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES MAY TAKE THAT AS MICHAEL THANK YOU SIR THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN MADAM. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I NUMBER THREE S. B. THIRTEEN.

INSTRUCTION I EACH OF THESE FOUR CAMPUSES TYPICALLY HOSTS TWO HUNDRED MOE STUDENTS EACH SUMMER WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS STUDENT INTEREST. AND AWARENESS OF EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE FIELDS- IS SOMEONE WHO IS THE CHILD OF- STEM PEOPLE MYSELF MY DAD WAS AN- AEROSPACE ENGINEER WHOSE- GOT A PHD IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. MY MOM WAS A CHEMISTRY PHD WHO ENDED UP WORKING AND- FROM SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS. I'M NOT A LAWYER SO WHAT FAR FROM THAT FIELD BUT I HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND TWO SONS WHO I HOPE WILL END UP IN SPAM. I AND ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS 52% OF THE PEOPLE IN IT ARE YOUNG GIRLS I WHICH IS AMAZING IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. HAVING MORE GENDER EQUITY IN STEM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY GET THAT DONE. I TOLD NINETY NINE TO INSURE THAT THE COSMOS PROGRAM CURRENTLY SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR CAN CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE LIVES OF YOUNG STUDENTS- SEE SO THIS IS- I JUST WANNA CLARIFY AND ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH FIX A TECHNICAL ERROR MADE IN DRAFTING THAT REGIONAL LANGUAGE I WOULD KNOW TO SB TWELVE NINETY NINE IS SUPPORTED AND SPONSORED BY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM AND ALSO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT HAS ON CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS TERRIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ONE OF THEM CHAR EARN. SENATORS FOR. TAKING TIME TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE MOST. PRECEDED SO I'VE BEEN INTO THE EXECUTIVE TO. SINCE THOUSAND FOURTEEN UP BECAUSE OF PROGRAM. AND THE- OF MAKE. AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING AS WELL AS- ARE TAUGHT IN. A COST MOTIONS THOUSAND AND FOUR SO I KNOW THE PROGRAM VERY WELL AS AN INSTRUCTOR- AND I'VE MY OWN SON HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM- SO I'M HERE TO. TO ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. SO APART FROM WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID THE PROGRAM IS- THIS OBVIOUSLY FOR EXCELLENCE IN IN HIGH SCHOOL. TRANSITION INTO COLLEGE AND WE'RE TRYING TO INSPIRED THESE YOUNG BRILLIANT MINDS. TO REALLY BECOME A PART OF THE PIPELINE OF EXCELLENCE INTO THE CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY- WE HAVE SOME. VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THAT HAPPENING THE PROGRAM HAVING EXISTED NOW FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ALL HIGH- AS CENTER MAN WAS SAYING WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS ON EACH CAMPUS NOW THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN. CONSISTENTLY OVER THE YEARS AT LEAST I HAVE BEEN- THE DIRECTOR FROM ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WE SERVED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN UNTIL NOW. NINE HUNDRED AND ALMOST FIFTY- LAST YEAR. WE HAD ONE OFF YOUR TWENTY TWENTY OF COURSE WHERE WE HAVE TO CANCEL. OF SO WE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE SERVICE TO- THE STATE AND TO THE STUDENTS. WE HAVE. FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED APPLICANTS THIS YEAR- MOST OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HIGHLY QUALIFIED STUDENTS FOR THOSE A GREAT DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO. TURN AWAY MANY QUALIFIED STUDENTS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF. THE LIMITATIONS TO SPACE AND RESOURCES FOR ONE TWO FOUR- THE PROGRAM IS BROKEN DOWN INTO CLUSTERS OF MANY DIFFERENT TOPICS SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE DIVERSE CITY COMES IN AND IN FACT THAT'S WHERE WE- I THINK HAVE SUCCESS IN GENDER EQUITY OF IT IN THE PROGRAM. WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM MECHANICAL ENGINEERING TO MATHEMATICS BIOLOGY TO. ALL SORTS OF THINGS GOING ON AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S A WIDE SPECTRUM OF THINGS GOING ON. WE ALSO HAVE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS IN FINANCIAL NEED- VERY MUCH SO AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO IF STUDENTS HAVE FINANCIAL NEED WE CAN SUPPORT THEM THE ADMISSIONS IS NEED BLIND SO WE SIMPLY GO IN AND WE SUPPORT THE STUDENTS BASED ON THE PHONE- THE FAMILY- FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. I AM IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE K. OF FAMILY INCOME YOU'VE GOT A FULL FELLOWSHIP IF YOU ARE BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. THEN THE RESORT OF ILLINOIS RAMPANT ABOVE A HUNDRED FIFTY SO ONE AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT PORTABLE BUT WE FOLLOW THAT. VERY CLOSELY WE RAISE THOSE FUNDS. FROM PRIVATE. FOR VERY GOOD THANK YOU MUCH MR ACTION WE HAVE YOUR- AND- IT MEMBER MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE QUESTIONS SO WE KNOW YOU'LL BE READY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANYBODY HERE IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WHO WISH TO. GIVE THEIR SUPPORT COME ON FORWARD. MARK EPSTEIN CALIFORNIAN FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK SUPPORT ON THIS HOWEVER WOULD ADD THAT WE NEED TO GO FURTHER. THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM WE NEED TO EXPAND IT ALSO FROM THE UC'S TO THE CSU SYSTEM. AND BEYOND JUST THE SUMMER PROGRAM TO SOMETHING YEAR ROUND. COMPARED TO SEVERAL OTHER STATES BOTH OUR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS LAG BEHIND. IN TECHNOLOGY IN DIGITAL SKILL SETS GRANT YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO ONE ELSE IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED MADAME MODERATOR TO HAVE ANYBODY ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWELVE NINETY NINE IF SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT SB. TWELVE NINETY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TWELVE NINETY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN THERE. WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM. BUT THE MINIMUM MODERATOR RIGHT WE HAVE NO ONE LISTED AS LEAD OPPOSITION. I DON'T SEE ANYONE HERE IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION MADAME MODERATOR WE WILL GO BACK TO YOU AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN A POSITION OF S. B. TWELVE. NINE NINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE NINETY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE. AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE NINETY NINE. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN THERE. WE HAVE NO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE NINETY NINE THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY I KNOW THAT SENATOR GLAZER HAS SOME COMMENTS THAT WILL GO TO SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU- THIS IS A FANTASTIC PROGRAM AND- I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EXTENDING ITS LIFE AND THAT THE GOOD WORK THAT IT DOES BUT THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ON THIS BILL IS THE- IS THE INCREASE IN TUITION AND FEES- AND SO I I'D BE IN CITY HEARING FROM THE AUTHOR ABOUT THAT THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME- I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW TO. THE REGION'S GET TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO WE ARE ADVISORY SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT THIS BILL WAS THE- PRODUCT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN WITH- WHEN I THINK EVERYONE WOULD SAY IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM. DOING REALLY GOOD WORK AND CREATING THAT PIPELINE SO IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO ASK. TO THE CHAIR. IF WE COULD HEAR ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE FEE AND TUITION INCREASES AND WHY WE SHOULD DO THAT VERSUS THE REGION SENATOR- SO. THAT THE FETUS TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT REQUIRE OR CREATE A TUITION INCREASE OR FEE INCEASE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALLOWS. THE PROGRAM TO GO UP TO A 5% INCREASE IN THE TUITION AND FEES- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TUITION WAS FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS- AND THE- THIS IS A MODEST POTENTIAL INCREASE THAT- WOULD ALLOW. THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE. DEALING WITH THE RISING EXPENSES THAT I THINK- PROFESSOR- ONDECK JENSEN- MENTIONED EARLIER DUE TO BOTH INCREASING ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS THAT JUST RISING INFLATION THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING- YEAH YOU KNOW AS FAR AS FEES NOT CREATE ONE THING IT'S JUST ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW IS THAT IT. IS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IT'S NOT HI READ ITSELF IS NOT SOMETHING TO IMPEACH ANY PATHWAYS NOTIFICATION- IN THERE ARE AS I UNDERSTAND IT SIGNIFICANT SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED TO CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT SO. APART IS THE CROSS SUBSIDIES THAT ACCRUE TO YOU KNOW STUDENTS THAT ARE. LOWER INCOME AND SO I THINK THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW- WORTHWHILE- THE MODEST POTENTIAL FEE AND TUITION INCREASES HERE ARE MEANT TO BE CONTENT WITH THOSE GOALS. BUT I WOULD ALSO ALLOW. A TYLER OR- DOCTORS. AND A KANSEN IF YOU LIKE TO COME IN THIS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SO THE FEE INCREASE IS SIMPLY A PART OF THE NORMAL PROGRESSION OF HOW THINGS ARE AT. ON CAMPUS WILL TO EXPANDING THE PROGRAM V. THE LIMIT THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED HERE 25% LIMIT INCREASED FOR FROM HERE TO HERE. IS REALLY ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE THE STATE FUNDS THAT GO IN AND SUPPORT THE PROGRAM A CONSTANT FROM YEAR TO YEAR IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO OUR REVENUE INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WITH THIS FIVE PERCENT. MAXIMUM IT ACTUALLY TRANSLATE TO A 3% MAXIMUM WHICH IS THE STANDARD. AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR GRANTS THAT WE COULD CALCULATE INTO MULTI YEAR GRANTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR INCREASE IN IN THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT- THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE SPENT ON THE PROGRAM. I HAD SO- I DON'T DISPUTE ANY ISSUE THAT THE COST TO GO UP I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY- WE WOULD WANT TO SPEAK INTO THE SPACE OF ABOUT HOW MUCH WHEN THIS IS A REGION CHOICE. AND THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY CHOICE AND THEIR BUDGET REQUESTS COME TO US EACH YEAR. TO FIND A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THIS ONE. HAZARD WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT WHY WHY WHY IS IT BEING PULLED OUT IN THIS WAY. AND GIVEN OUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE STATE IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE ISSUE FOR ME TO WANT TO RAISE TUITION AND FEES WE WERE EVEN A WORTHY PROGRAM LIKE THIS. WHEN THIS REALLY IS A CHOICE THE REGION'S CONNECTS SO AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE. WHY SHOULD WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE SETTING AYE AYE AND AMOUNTS IN THIS BILL THIS WHERE. THE BILL THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. DO YOU WANT YOUR LIKE YES IF I MAY SAY MEDIA NO SENT GLAZER AYE APPRECIATE THAT CON- YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT. IS NOT BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE UC AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE REGION'S ASK- BUT I THINK IN GENERAL YOU KNOW WE BE OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE- THIS IS LARGELY JUST. A PRIORITY OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF COST TO INCREASE AND WHEN THEY DO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF SAVINGS FROM COVE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT AND CAN BE. PUT TOWARDS MORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CAN. HELP ME OUT HERE. BUT THE SAME TIME- THE ABILITY TO INCREASE IT 25% EACH YEAR- THAT'S THE THIRTY WERE LOOKING FOR BUT I THINK EVERYONE HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE FUNDING PRIORITIES I'D BE HAPPY TO. TO TALK ABOUT IF I COULD JUST INTERJECT YET THEN AND I WANT TO INTERJECT TO SAY THAT THE TUITION AMOUNT IS ALREADY IN STATUTE. SO THIS ISN'T CHANGING WHAT'S IN STATUTE IF THAT HELPS YOU AT ALL. RIGHT BUT YOU'RE LEYVA WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS BILL WAS SILENT ON TUITION. OTHER REGIONS WITHOUT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT HOW THEY FUND THE PROGRAM WITH THEIR REQUIRES FEE INCREASES ARE TUITION INCREASES. AS IS. THE CASE FOR. ALL UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE EDUCATION IN THE SYSTEM SO WHY DO WE AS THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED. TO EVEN PUT THESE PARAMETERS NOT WHY IS THAT PART OF THIS BILL WHY IS IT NECESSARY I GUESS IF IT DIFFERENTLY. I WANT TO SUPPORT EXPANDING AND IN THIS PROGRAM BUT- BUT WHYDO WE HAVE TO SPEAK PLAZA TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE OF TUITION AND FEES. OKAY AND I'M GONNA LET CENTER MEN ANSWER AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO YOU SENATOR DOLLY AND PERHAPS TYLER CAN EXPAND ON THIS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAM. IS THAT THIS IS. THIS PARTICULAR. METHOD OF- PROVIDING AUTHORIZATION RIKSBANK TUITION. IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED AND PASS AND- AS I THINK EITHER ALLUDED TO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY. LISTED IS NOT A PRIORITY FOR THE UC REGENTS- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS I DON'T KNOW. SO THIS IF WE WANT TO DO THIS OURSELVES- YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. CAN MATCH UP WITH EXPECTED INCREASES OR POTENTIAL INCREASES IN COSTS AND INFLATION- THIS THIS IS GOING TO NOW WE COULD HAVE SCOTIAN. POSE HOC ABOUT WITH WE WANT TO CHANGE THE FUNDING- AND TAKE MORE CAN. AND I BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT KIND. WE YOU AND YOUR STAFF- BUT BUT AT THIS POINT TIME THIS IS. I GUESS THIS IS THE STATUS QUO STAYING THE COURSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT BUT TYLER IS THAT. CORRECT ARTICULATION. YEAH I MEAN SO YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION. EIGHTY SIX ONE SIX THAT WENT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH ESSENTIALLY JUST ASK FOR THE SAME. ALLOWABLE 5% IN THE SAME FIVE YEAR. REAUTHORIZATION ARE FOCUSED. WORST IS ON THE SUNSET EXTENSION GIVEN THAT BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE PROGRAM. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO YOU AND- HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SO WE APPRECIATE THAT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE JUST LEAVE IT AT FIVE YEAR EXTENSION. SO IT'S UPDATING. THE LANGUAGE RATHER THAN RE WRITING THE LANGUAGE. SO IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BEFORE THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAM- I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I THINK THAT I LOOK AT I WAS IN AROUND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR WHATEVER WAS ESTABLISHED BUT- MY GUESS IS THAT. THROUGH LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE DESIRE TO ADVANCE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. THAT WE- PASSED A LOT OF DUE TO. THE TO THE REGIONS THIS MAY NOT BE A PRIORITY TO YOU BUT IT'S A PRIORITY TO US. SO IT IS A LITTLE CURIOUS AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT'S THAT YOU CAN CREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. WHY WE HAVE TO DO THAT ANYMORE I MEAN I. YOU TALK ABOUT A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION I RATHER ELIMINATE- THE AND THE US SUNSET ON IT THE PROGRAM STAYS IN EFFECT FOREVER. BUT I WHAT'S BAFFLING TO ME IS THAT THIS IS A REALLY A WORKAROUND OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS I'M INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR- OF OUR UC EDUCATION I THINK W OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A LOT MORE MONEY THAN THEY'VE BEEN GETTING. AND THEY GET TO SET THE PRIORITIES IF THIS IS A SELF SUSTAINING PROGRAM WHICH I THINK THE CLAIM IS THAT IT IS. WHY WOULD THE REGION'S EVER OBJECT. TO THAT- TO CONTINUING THAT IN THIS FORM OR WHATEVER FORM OF THEIR WISDOM AND IT'S AGAIN. WHY SB AS A LEGISLATOR VOTING FOR A TUITION INCREASE AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS THE UNCOMFORTABLE PART OF WHAT IT. WHAT IT IS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO TRY TO CLARIFY. THANK YOU CENTER CLOSER INTENDED DOLLAR FORGET YOUR DID HAVE A CENTER PAM BEFORE YOU SORRY. GO AHEAD CENTER PAM. THANK YOU SO FIRST OF ALL OF THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM AND OF THE BILL. I GUESS- FROM HEARING FROM SAN GLAZER IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN PASSED THE RATIONS OF THE BILL WHY EVEN BOTHER PUTTING IT TUITION. AMOUNT IN THERE RIGHT IT IS IT'S- LOOK AT THE REGIONS DO THAT AND MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT- IS IT'S- PRESENTED BY THE- WITNESSES SUPPORT AND THAT- THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID SO THAT. FINANCIAL YELTSIN THAT SO THAT- NEEDS A DATE SO THAT IT'S- NOT A NATION ISN'T. BASED ON- ISN'T AFFECTED% BY NEED RIGHT SO THAT ALL ALL. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE PROGRAM AND JUST NOT GET INTO THE HOW MUCH. YOU'RE CHARGING IT SAID AROUND LESS L. AS LONG AS THERE'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. TO INSURE THAT AT. ALL STUDENTS REGARD. OF OTHER. INCOME HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR A- TO. PRODUCE AND BE SUPPORTED. SO THE PERHAPS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO THAT THIS BUT I DIGITAL TO SAY THAT I'M REALLY SUPPORT- APPRECIATE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY- AEROSPACE ENGINEERS- MECHANICAL ENGINEERS INVOLVED BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS ALSO A MECHANICAL ENGINEER HER SPACE ENGINEER. SO SO WITH THAT- ACTUALLY I WOULD TO THE MOVE THE BILL AND ACTUALLY ASK THE COULD BE A CO AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PANTS CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU I LOOK. WE ALL SUPPORTED BUT I THINK THIS IS- THE PRESIDENT SETTING THIS KIND F A WORK AROUND OUR BUDGET PROCESS THAT'S WHAT I. HEAR THE SENATOR BRING UP AND I THINK THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT- THIS COULD THIS COULD HAPPEN IN OTHER BILLS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY. GOING TO BE RAISING TUITION AT A TIME WHEN WE SHOULD JUST BE PAYING FOR IT. OUT OF OUR BUDGET SO I THINK THAT- YOU MIGHT WANNA DRESSES I THINK THIS IS I THINK WE COULD DO THIS WE CAN TAKEA MINUTE TO THIS BILL IT WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL I THINK TO JUST SEND IT TO THE REGULAR PROCESS AND THAT WAY WE WOULD BE RAISING TUITION. JUST PAY FOR IT OUT OF THE- REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I WILL LET YOU- AND THE AUTHOR DISCUSS FUTURE AMENDMENTS- WE HAVE THE BILL BEFORE US NOW WHICH WE WILL VOTING ON. BUT BEFORE THAT THERE'S NO CHOI BOGUE AND CENTER CORTESE GO HEAD CENTER CHOI BOGUE. I JUST I WITHOUT BEING REDUNDANT I JUST WANNA. SAY THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORT- THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE SARAH CENTER GLAZERS THAT ARE DOLLY. I ALSO BELIEVE IN THE PROGRAM AND I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM AND IT SHOULD BE. CONTINUING WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE SUNSET PERIOD JUST BE REMOVED I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S THERE- BEING THAT. IT IT. HAS INCREDIBLE MERIT AND IS SO MUCH NEEDED TODAY'S TIME SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT COULD ALSO BE AN AMENDMENT ON THAT END. IF THAT COULD JUST BE. COMPLETELY REMOVED BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO WHAT IT IS. RIGHT AND AT THIS TIME. THE HARDEST PART FOR ME FOR THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IS THAT IT. IS TALKS ABOUT INCREASING FEES AND AT THE TIME OF WERE HAVING A SURPLUS THAT WE DO HAVE. AN UNDERSTANDING OF FINANCIAL- IMITATIONS OUR FAMILIES- IN OUR STUDENTS HAVE. I AM I'M KIND OF GREATLY CONCERNED WITH THAT AND ALSO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. IT SAYS HERE THAT- IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN ELIGIBLE IN STATE STUDENTS PAID THIRTY NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO FOR THE SUMMER PROGRAM WITH ONLY ELEVEN PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING ANY FINANCIAL AID. THIS IS A REDUCTION FROM THE TWO SUMMER TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WERE NEARLY 22% OF PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED FINANCIAL AID IS THERE. PLEASE SO IF YOU IT'S 11% BUT NOT JUST ELEVEN TO ELEVEN I'M SORRY THAT'S WHAT I'M AT 11% I APOLOGIZE YES WITH IT ONLY 11% OF PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID- A REDUCTION FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH NEARLY RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID WHY SUCH A REDUCTION. WOULD COME FROM THE APPLICANT POOL OF WE HAVE AGREAT EFFORT IN OUTREACH AND TRYING TO GET AS MANY A STUDENT FROM CALIFORNIA TO COME INTO THE PROGRAM AS I SAID THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS IS NEED BLIND AND THE FINANCIAL AID AWARDS ARE BASED ONLY AND SOLELY UPON FINANCIAL NEED SO THIS IS WHAT WE WHAT COMES TO MY OFFICE FROM THE CAMPUSES WERE ADMITTING TO STUDENTS. WHO DO NOT KNOW WHICH STUDENT IS IN FINANCIAL NEED- IT'S SIMPLY BASED ON HOW THEY FIT INTO THE CLUSTERS FOR THIS THESE ARE NOT MEMBERS THAT WE TRY TO DESIGN BEFORE THE NUMBERS TO COME OUT OF IT SO IT'S SIMPLY THE AMOUNT OF ADMITTED. STUDENTS INTO THE PROGRAM. THE HAS THAT STATISTICS SO WE AWARD FINANCIAL NEED A FINANCIAL AID. RICK REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY IT IS- WE SIMPLY USE THAT WILL BREAK SO IT TURNED OUT THAT THAT THE YEAR THAT WAS A LOW NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO NEEDED FOR NEED A PROFESSIONAL OKAY THE STATE WE DON'T FIND ACTUALLY TRIED TO HAVE A TARGET AMOUNT DURING THE- FIFTH PERFECT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU SENATOR CHOI BOGUE. CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE A GOOD EIGHT EIGHT DO HAVE JUST COME OF A TECH QUESTION BUT I WANT TO. AGREE WITH THE GENERAL SUNSET I THINK THIS IS AN OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION. NON GOVERNMENTAL RBC. THERE BE SOME DESIRE TO DO THAT- IN IT WE HAVE WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE STOOD UP BY NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES- IN SILICON VALLEY BUT- BUT THAT'S SAID- THE TECHNICAL QUESTION I HAVE IS IN IN. THE SECOND PART OF- THE DISCUSSION HERE IN MY PACKET IT TALKS ABOUT SITTING FEE UP TO. FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS PER SESSION- THAT CORRESPONDS TO ACTUAL PROGRAM COSTS WHICH- TO ME SOUNDS LIKE JUST COST RECOVERY IN MY TECHNICAL QUESTION IS. THIS THIS IS UC- BROWN BY COST RECOVERY- PRINCIPLES ON FEES- LIKE. A GOVERNMENT. AGENCIES ARE WE NEED YOU CAN'T EXCEED COST RECOVERY BUT WITHOUT THAT BECOMING A ATTACKS BASICALLY ALLOWED ALLOWED TAYLOR TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS WE CAN I THINK I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO QUESTION NO IT'S COMING BEFORE I'M HAPPY TO GET THE ANSWER AND THEN GIVE IT BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ONCE I GET IT- BUT I DON'T HAVE ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD. YEAH IF YOU COULD BE IMPORTANT I MEAN I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IT ANYWAY THE PROBABLY. WOULD APPLY TO. USER LEGISLATION THAT LOOKING AT IT AT SOME LEVEL- BUT ALSO. IT'S IF IT'S- IF ALREADY HAVE COST RECOVERY. YOU KNOW LIMITS AND CAPABILITIES ON OUR OWN- THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS WHY WHY EVEN BOTHER PRESCRIBING TO THE BILL OTHER THAN TO JUST SAY THAT- IF ANYTHING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD MAKE SEEK COST RECOVERY BUT I HINK THAT'S REDUNDANT. I JUST I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT IT. IT MAY JUST IN THE ENTIRE NEED FOR ANY OF THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE THANK YOU AND I DO INTEND. B. AND I BOTH OF THE BILL SAID I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING REPORT. THANK YOU CENTER CORTE CENTER BEFORE I GET YOU FOR YOUR- YOUR CLOTHES. I WOULD JUST SAY- THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION MEMBERS AND THE I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL FULLY. THIS IS A SUNSET EXTENSION IT HAS BEEN DONE FOUR TIMES BEFORE SO THIS IS NOT NEW- MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HARM. A CLEARLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. I WOULD ASK FOLKS THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. AND IF THERE ARE CONCERNS AND AMENDMENTS THAT FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE GET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND THEN YOU WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. TO MAKE SURE ANY OF THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCERNED YOU HAVE A WORK OUT WITH HIM. CENTERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I THANK YOU MANAGER AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I WOULD AGREE WITH THEM AND JUST POINT OUT YOU KNOW WE ARE HAPPY TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW. THE ENDING IS A SENSE THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONSIDER MAKING THIS PROGRAM PERMANENT- I THINK RIGHT NOW THE GOAL IS TO. AND EXTENDING THIS BUT- SHOULD THERE BE THE APPETITE WITHIN THE BODY HERE TO DO SOMETHING MORE AMBITIOUS- WE RECENTLY OPENED THAT I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE SENTIMENT HERE THAT- THIS IS A PROGRAM WORTH DOING- IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND IT HAS PROMOTED NOT ONLY GENDER EQUITY BYA LOT OF RACIAL EQUITY WHICH I DIDN'T MENTION AS WELL AND THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TIME AND I ASKED RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTERMAN. CENTER PANDERED TO MOVE THE BILL VERY GOOD MENTAL CONSULTANT THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I AM NUMBER FIVE S. B. TWELVE NINETY NINE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE AMENDED. LEYVA AYE. LEYVA AYE OTOBO. AYE WHICH OBADIAH COURTESY I. CORTES THE AYE DALY.

THANKS JOHN YES IT WAS ON ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS- I AM PLEASED PERCENT SB NINE NINE SEVEN THE BILL THAT WILL AMPLIFY STUDENT VOICES AND NINE SEVEN STRENGTHENS STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE- LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. AND IS KNOWN AS EL CAP AND- PROVIDES LIAISE WITH TWO OPTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THE FIRST WOULD ADD TO STUDENT NUMBERS TO ANY PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWS THE L. CAP. OR THE SECOND OPTION WOULD ALLOW THE CREATION OF A STUDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE L. CAP. YOU'LL CAP IS A POWERFUL PLANNING TOOL THAT HELPS DISTRICTS VALLEY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OUTLINED GOALS ACTION SERVICES AND EXPENDITURES. IN CURRENT LAW REQUIRES EACH LOCATELLI A TO HAVE A PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE PROVIDES INPUT TO THE AQAP. L. STILL INPUT IS TYPICALLY SOLICITED THROUGH MEANS OF GENERAL CONSOLATION THEY JUST SURVEYS AND FORMS. THE WAKE OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC MOST OF THE PRESSING IT AT THE MOST PRESSING EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS LEARNING LOS COLLAPSES IN THE DIVISION CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND MORE. BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS. BUT THERE'S A LACK OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON BEST EL CAPIT BY THREE COMMITTEES HOW CAN WE MOST THAT THE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING CHALLENGES THEIR STUDENTS FACE. IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT% ELLIE AS ALLOW STUDENTS DIRECTLY IN THE L. CAP PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ADAPT PRIORITIES AND ENSURE THAT BUDGETS REFLECT IMMEDIATE CONCERNS OF STUDENTS THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR STUDENT VOICES IN EDUCATION POLICY OR GIVE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. A SEAT AT THE TABLE. SB NINE SEVEN JOYCE FROM GENERATION UP THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT BOARD THAT NUMBER ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIANS FOR JUSTICE THERE'S NO. FORMAL REGISTERED OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL AND I'M PLEASED TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES AND PORT- LAYO CORDEAUX CLARK FROM CHEN UP AND FORMER L.

HELLO YOU'LL HEAR ME WE SURE CAN. EXCELLENT MORNING CHAIRWOMAN LEYBURN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEVEL COURSE OF CLARK AND I'M THE FORMER STUDENT BOARD MEMBER OF ALBANY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE EAST BAY A STUDENT ADVOCATE WITH JENNA I WAS ALSO THE FIRST EVER STUDENT NUMBER OF ALBANY UNIFIED HEALTH HAVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE BUT I HELD FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL I GRADUATED WHEN I ATTENDED MY FIRST OKAY MEETING I'LL ADMIT I FELT A BIT OUT OF PLACE. I WAS DAUNTED BY UNFAMILIAR TERMS LIKE UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AND I AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED MY INPUT TO BE LESS VALUABLE THE EXPERTISE OF SOME OF THE MORE EXPERIENCE THE BILL FROM THE COMMITTEE HOWEVER WHEN IT WAS MY FIRST TURN TO GIVE INPUT ON ALBANY'S DISTRICT GOALS AND PRIORITIES I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE AMAZEMENT OF THE ADULT COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE SURE THE MOST BASIC OF STUDENT CONCERNS PARENTS TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS NONE HAD ANY LEVEL OF FAMILIARITY WITH ISSUES THAT WERE UNIVERSALLY KNOWN TO THE STUDENT BODY. IT WAS THEN THAT I REALIZED THAT EVEN WITH NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE AT ALL MY VOICE AND INPUT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A HELICOPTER I BELIEVE THAT STUDENT INPUT IS THE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES IN EDUCATION IF YOU'RE DROPPING CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ASK STUDENTS THE REASON BEING IS CLASS YOU'RE COMBATING THE RACIAL ACHIEVEMENT GAP AFLAC IN HISPANIC STUDENTS WHAT RESOURCES WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO SUCCEED THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE IS MORE THAN JUST ONE MORE VOICE IN THE ROOM IT INSIGHT ON EVERY ASPECT OF THE SCHOOL EXPERIENCE BEYOND TEST SCORES AND ATTENDANCE RATE. I THINK I CAN NOT BE MEASURED WITH NUMBERS AND CANNOT BE SUBSTITUTED BY INPUT FROM ADULTS WHO ARE TOO FAR REMOVED FROM THE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE AT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US THE ISSUES THAT SCHOOL DIDN'T SPACE ARE CONSTANTLY AND RAPIDLY CHANGING IN ORDER FOR ELLIE IS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PRIORITIES TRULY REFLECTED IN NEED SIMPLICES MUST BE CENTERED IN THESE CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS AND THAT STARTS WITH MEANINGFUL ST REPRESENTATION IN THE L. CAP PROFIT.
