00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:50.896
EIGHTY- I KNOW THAT- THERE ARE

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.831
MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT-

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:55.834
TOOK PPP LOANS AND- USE THOSE

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:59.070
FUNDS TO HELP KEEP THE PAYROLL

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:00.472
GOING EVEN WHEN THEY'RE

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:01.740
TECHNICALLY WASN'T ACTUALLY

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.875
ENOUGH WORK- FOR THOSE

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.411
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF- THE

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:07.612
PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS THAT WE HAD

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.514
TO- TRY TO LIMIT THE SPREAD THE

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.516
CORONA VIRUS SO MANY BUSINESSES

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.386
REQUIRED TO- CUT BACK THEIR

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:15.654
OPERATIONS OR SHUT DOWN

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.789
ALTOGETHER AND- THE PURPOSE OF

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.457
THE PDP LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:21.393
GOVERNMENT WERE TO THE SMALL

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.461
BUSINESS CREATION WORK TO TRY

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.864
TO HELP BUSINESSES. CONTINUE TO

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:26.731
PAYROLLS IN FACT YOU HAD TO

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:30.268
SPEND AT LEAST 60% OF THE MONEY

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.437
ON PAYROLL ITSELF- NOT A ANY

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:33.872
OTHER EXPENSES AND OTHE

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.240
EXPENSES ARE LIMITED TO THINGS

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.708
LIKE RENT UTILITIES SO IT'S

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.777
VERY NARROWLY CONSTRAIN AND I

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:41.780
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT-

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:43.648
THAT WE DON'T SENSATIONALIZE

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:46.251
BUSINESSES TO ACTUALLY TOOK WHO

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:49.154
WHO GOT THESE LOANS AND EVEN

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.689
TOOK THE STEP TO PERHAPS

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.023
CONTINUE THEIR EMPLOYEES ON

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.859
THEIR PAYROLL WHEN THE

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:54.759
ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.328
JUST A HALF HOUR LATER MAS AND

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.495
HAVE THEM- PLANET BECAUSE THERE

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.164
WAS NO REVENUE BEING GENERATED.

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.566
AND MIGHT HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN-

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.869
SUFFICIENT WORK- THAT AND THAT

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:05.904
MADE SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THIS

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.640
IF THEY HAD NO SUPPORT SO I

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:09.641
THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.776
STEP IS MY ONE QUESTION FOR

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:15.247
