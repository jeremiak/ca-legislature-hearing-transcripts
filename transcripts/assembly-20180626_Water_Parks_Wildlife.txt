NINE NINETEEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO DEPLOY A NETWORK OF STREAM GAUGES. INCLUDING A DETERMINATION OF OF FUNDING NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REACTIVATING [inaudible] EXISTING GAUGES. THIS GOT MY ATTENTION THE CALIFORNIA'S LOST THE ABILITY TO MEASURE STREAM FLOW WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT TYPE OF DATA. FOR OUR WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. 86% OF THE STATE'S SIGNIFICANT STREAMS ARE POORLY GAUGED STREAM FLOW DATA SUPPORTS DAVID A WATER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. UNDERLYING OPERATION OF STATE IN REGIONAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AMONG OTHER USES. CALIFORNIA USED TO HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED STREAM GAUGES NEARLY HALF OF THOSE GAUGES HAVE BECOME INACTIVE. EVEN FEWER GAUGES PROVIDE RICH REAL TIME REPORTING. RESTORING STREAM GAGES IN THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE STATEWIDE IN REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO S.. B. NINE ONE NINE AND I ASK YOU RIGHT. WITNESSES AND SUPPORT GREAT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF HIS FACTS ABOUT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY OR STRONG SUPPORT OF SB NINE NINETEEN ONE THING CENTER DODD.

THAT COMPREHENSIVE DOWNTOWN STREAMFLOW CONDITIONS PROVIDED FROM THE STRAIN GAUGES DOES NOT EXIST IN CALIFORNIA AND THE STATUS NEEDED TO MANAGE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR PEOPLE. FARM FOR FARMS AND WILDLIFE AS WELL AS WE NINE NINETEEN WOULD CREATE A PLAN TO DETERMINE WHERE WE SHOULD TO REACTIVATE EXISTING GAUGES AND PLAY NEW GAUGES AND PARTY LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS BILL RECOGNIZE AN ONGOING. TWENTY FIVE ENGAGES IN THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO FILL THE VOID TO VOTE TO PROVIDE MORE OPEN DATA INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY PENS TRANSPARENCY EXCUSE ME.

AND THE REAL TIME DATA AYE INSURES THAT FLOW RATES ARE THERE TO PROTECT ENDANGERED FISH FISH SPECIES. COMING OFF OF THE TUBS FIRE LAST YEAR ONE OF OUR GREAT CONCERN XIN WATER AGENCY WAS FLOODING EVENTS AND MORE SEDIMENT LOADING FROM RUNOFF. WE ACTIVELY SOUGHT. FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING ASSISTANCE BUT MORTGAGES IN PLACE OUR SEARCH CAME UP EMPTY SUPPORT REALLY I ENCOURAGED BY THIS BILL TO UP FACILITATE MORE FUNDING FOR GAUGES GOING FORWARD. RESTAURANT ABOUT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE BILL WE DO HAVE TWO RELATIVELY MODEST REQUESTED AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY EMPHASIZE THE VALUE THAT A ROBUST AND RELIABLE STRING GAUGE NETWORK CAN HAVE TO THE STATE. WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. BURKE BROUGH REPRESENTING SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE OF BRING IT BACK MISTER SOMEONE [inaudible] RIVER. OKAY SO SAY NO ONE WILL BRING BACK A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WHAT? DOES THAT HAVE YOU FEE OF A HOW MUCH OF THIS WILL COST AND THE WHAT THE FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE. WELL. THAT'S PART OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WHAT THE COST WILL BE. THIS BILL -- DOES NOT HAVE A FUNDING -- ESSENTIALLY WHAT -- WE BE LOOKING FOR BUDGET ALLOCATION OR TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THE A WATER BOND OR SUB I GOT FOR FOR FUNDS. TO FUND THIS WE GO FORWARD BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS FIRST. IN ORDER TO I TAKE THAT VERY IMPORTANT STEP. THANK YOU YOU KNOW WITHOUT HIS MANAGER WHAT IS SO CURRENT PROBLEM HOW DOES THIS BILL IMPROVED HEALTH PROBLEM. I THINK THAT THAT BY A BOOK. AND THERE'S NUMBER OF ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRSTLY AT THAT WE KNOW THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE COMPLETE A SURVEY THIS YEAR DETERMINE HOW MANY. OF YOU KNOW OF SEARCHING GAUGES IN CALIFORNIA ACTIVE REVERSES NOT AND SO THERE'S OVER THIRTY SIX HUNDRED LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE STRING GAUGES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AT SOME POINT BUT CURRENTLY ONLY 54% ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE. AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A HARD TIME MONITORING AT IN A REAL TIME DATA RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE FLOWS ARE IN STATE FOR SO FOR HABITAT FOR VIEW OF PURPOSES OF FISH AND OTHER PURPOSES. AS IF YOU DON'T HAVE AND THAT I KNOW SORT OF AN ACCURATE MONITORING OF WITH THE WATER FLOWS. OUT YOU CAN HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THAT BETWEEN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. BY KNOWING THE ONLINE OUTLAW WATER FLOWING HOW DOES IT RELATE TO US. FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW PROTECTING FISH -- COMES NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. BY LOWERING THE BY MEASURING. THE AMOUNT OF LOVE I' ON IT WHAT YOU. YET KNOWING THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE WATER FLOWING. WHAT DOES US MORE ONE KNOWLEDGE? A MINNESOTA ALREADY AFFECTED. NO FISH LIVE SO IF THERE'S A I MEAN THERE'S ISSUES I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW MONITORING -- SWORDFISH NO QUESTION BUT ALSO ADDITIONALLY AB SOME OF THE OTHER WEEK USES FOR STRING GAUGES ARE TO ALSO FOR ISSUES OF FLICK FLOOD. CONTROL AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AS WELL TO SUBMIT TROLL -- CONDITIONS BUT ALSO -- FOR MONITORING FOR PURPOSES OF FOR FOR ADAM. FLOOD CONTROL PURPOSES AS WELL. YEAH I JUST THINK THAT DID THE IDEAS YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW THIS BRINGS THE INFORMATION -- TWO THE DECISION MAKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN SOME CASES IT WAS. YAWN DOT THE OF FLOW -- YOU'RE SOMEWHERE BELOW IT DAM THEY COULD LET RELEASE MORE WATER SO. I HAD YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IT'S IT IT'S IT IT'S ALL PART OF THAT SYSTEM OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONCE HAD. THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A LOT OF IT AND THAT FUNDING IS GOT AWAY AND THIS IS WHY. THAT WE NEED TO WORK MOVE ON THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE THIS DATA THESE DATA SETS HERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OURSELVES. I GUESS I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- WITHOUT THE STATE IT'S DIFFICULT ALSO COMMIT TO AND TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHERE THERE MAY BE DIVERSIONS TAKING PLACE -- FROM SRI BUT THAT CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND AND THE NORTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT WHERE DIVERSIONS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME -- FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS WITHOUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE STREAMS ARE GOING DRY AND WHERE THE WATER'S GOING AND SO THIS IS PART OF THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF THIS ISSUE. ANYONE OF US. WE HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] A SECOND. BOB MR DOT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER DODD THE BAD THE THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED -- APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH YOU BRING IN THIS BEFORE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR NOT JUST THE DISTRICT BUT I THINK FOR CALIFORNIA THE WHOLE.

BUT APPARENTLY NOT [inaudible] FELT. WELL THANK YOU -- MISTER. TEMPORARY CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WANNA FIRST START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS MEASURE THIS IS S. B.. TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD START WITH THAT. HOW I'M VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE SUGGEST AMENDMENT DISCUSSED? AND THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. HOW ON THIS ISSUE TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THE MEASURE AND CREATE THE BEST? A POSSIBLE PROGRAM. SO THIS SAY THIS BILL -- ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROGRAM AND FIND WITHIN THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD -- TO BE FUNDED BY OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FROM THE JEEP CHEROKEE. TO FIND PROVEN PROJECTS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL THAT WILL BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND INCREASE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MITIGATE. AND ADAPT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE ALSO. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THOSE TO COMPLY WITH A LOT OF OUR AMBITIOUS STATE GOALS. SO THE STATE CAN COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ALREADY HAS AN ADAPTATION PROGRAM. DESIGNED TO CAPTURE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND HOPE LOCAL COMMUNITIES NATURAL RESOURCES ADAPT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I BUILDING ON THIS SUCCESSFUL MODEL THIS BILL SEEKS TO SCALE UP OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE BUILD A COORDINATED AND COHESIVE. STATEWIDE PROGRAM TO GUIDE EFFORTS TO ENSURE ARE NOT TO RESOURCES ARE RESILIENT. IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA ARE HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FUNDING -- FOR THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE NATURAL WORKING LANDS AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT THIS BILL TAKES A ASSEMBLY DIFFERENT PROTRUDE THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS BY ALLOWING GRANTING AGENCIES TO TAILOR FINDING A PROJECTS. THAT CAN ADDRESS THE RESILIENCY IN ADAPTATION NEEDS OF A GIVEN COMMUNITY YOUR REGION AND NOT JUST FOCUS FUNDING ON REDUCING EMISSIONS. SO IN URBAN COMMUNITIES FUNDING COULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS HEAT ISLAND CONCERNS PROVIDE TREE CANOPY AND PART ACCESS IMPROVE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY IN OUR CITIES. AYE NEWMAN COMMUNITIES THEY MAY BENEFIT THROUGH PROTECTION RESTORATION OF OUR GREEN BELTS AND BUFFER AREAS SUCH AS WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT HAVE. REDUCE THE FLOODING EXPERIENCE IN SAN JOSE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I PROTECTING AGRICULTURAL WORKING LANDS IT SERVICE WILDLIFE HABITAT AND CENTRAL VALLEY. FORCED REGIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS ALONG WITH REDUCING FIRE RISK IN RESTORING FORCE TOUGH. THESE REGIONS WILL I NEED TO CAREFULLY MANAGE VULNERABLE WATERSHEDS TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER SOURCES AN ARTICULATION. APPLIES TO THE IDEA THAT WE NEED AT A REGIONAL FOCUS AND AS YOU KNOW THE OAK IN CINEMA THAT BURNED MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CHAPARRAL. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALWAYS A FIRE RISK THE BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES OFFERING THIS BILL ENSURES THAT EACH REGION OF OUR STATE EACH COMMUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR FUNDS EITHER THROUGH THEIR LOCAL CONSERVANCY. OR IF THEY DON'T HAVE ONE THROUGH THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION OR THE WICB. ARE CONSERVANCY IS DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE BOTH ADDRESSING ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY AND IMPORTANTLY. WORKING EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO FIND EMPLOYMENT LOCAL PRIORITIES. AND INOTES WE'VE SEEN FIRES MUDSLIDES DROUGHTS. FLOODS EXTREME HEAT EVENTS IT'S IT'S ARE STRONG SENSE THAT WE NEED TO SET UP A STATEWIDE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON NATURAL RESOURCES ADAPTATION. AND RESILIENCY IN THE IN THE FACE OF SOME OF THE CHANGING. NOT CLIMATE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AND WITH THAT I RESPECT YES WHEN I VOTE AND TURNER WITH. THANKS A LOT I THINK THANKS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT LUCAS BURKE SOME HAVE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. US HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TEN FIFTEEN THINK SENATOR ALLEN FOR CARRYING THIS MEASURE. A YOU KNOW IT'S AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT INVESTMENTS NEED TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND MITIGATE THE WORST OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S ALSO NEED FIRST THE STATE INVESTING CLIMBERS ALLIANCE. AS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALREADY HELPING AS EVIDENCED BY HIGHER TEMPERATURES LONGER FIRE SEASON SENSIBLY YEAR ROUND AT THIS POINT. WITH OF COURSE THE MOST THE MOST INTENSE AND DESTRUCTIVE FIRES -- IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. A ALSO LESS FREQUENT MORE INTENSE STORMS THIS PAST DECADE AT THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE WILL FUND PROJECTS AT THAT HELP CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS. WITHSTAND THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS MORE AND MORE ARE NATURAL RESOURCE. NOT NOT RESOURCES LACK OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE HAVING DEVASTATING AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITIES. THE GOAL OF S. B. TEN FIFTEEN IS TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL THAT THEY IN TURN CAN PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. A TO REACH THIS GOAL SB TEN FIFTEEN BUILDS OFF THE KIND IT READY PROGRAM OF THE STATE AND COSTA CONSERVANCY. AT CLIMB ADAPTATION PROGRAM FOR NASA RESOURCES THE CURRENTLY EXISTING STATUTE -- IN ITS EXPANSION OF THIS -- ANY BUILDS ON THIS EXISTING PROGRAM AT THESE PROGRAMS INVESTMENTS ARE GREAT START BUT MORE MUCH MORE IS NEEDED AND NOW WITH RESPECT ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] FOR MUCH. YOU KNOW JUST YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE TO SUPPORT AND OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE.

VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING ELEANOR TEAS ON BEHALF OF BIG STAR LAND TRUST BOLSA CHICA LAND TRUST CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCIES CINEMA COUNTY AG OPEN SPACE DISTRICT AND THE WILD THINGS CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT THINK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN SEVEN WITH THAT CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK. WE ARE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. BECAUSE AS THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS IT HAD DUPLICATES AND THREATENS TO UNDERMINE OUR EXISTING CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROGRAMS FOR NATURAL WORKINGMAN'S -- WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT DESIRE TO ADVANCE CLIMATE RESILIENCY POLICY -- A AND SHARE THAT INTEREST BUT WOULD PREFER TO BUILD ON EXISTING PROGRAMS RATHER THAN CREATE A NEW PROGRAM -- AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AT THE TIME THE AUTHOR STAFF IS SPENT IN DISCUSSING POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- AS RECENTLY SPEAK BUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW CAN'T SPUR ANYONE ELSE. YOU KNOW BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I I HAVE A QUESTION GOTTA AND THAT IS ALONG THE SAME LINES AS THE OPPOSITION WITNESSED THIS IS A KIND OF THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR ME -- BEEN A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF WORKING LANCE -- THE VALUE OF WORKING LANSING CLIMATE RESILIENCY -- YOU'VE MENTIONED YOUR BILL TALKS ABOUT PROVEN -- PROJECTS -- I BELIEVE THAT -- THERE IS NOW SCIENCE TO SUPPORT -- THAT WORKING LANDS ACTUALLY DO THAT YET THEY'RE YET WE STILL ARE WERE STILL PART ON THIS HOW TO HOW HOW CAN WE RESOLVE THIS. YEAH ARE YOU KNOW I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THIS -- SET OF CONCERNS AND I I YOU KNOW THAT THE FACT IS THAT WE DO HAVE A WHOLE SET OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO AGRICULTURE SECTOR. ARE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING IT'S BEEN SAID I JUST. THIS IS A DIFFERENT BILL ON IT ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC AND I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SUPPORT BUILDING ON THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE EXISTING AND WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER AND TRYING. TO TRY TO DO THAT -- WE YOU KNOW BUT IT AYE I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE WE IF THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE DIFFERENT ISSUES I MEAN JUST IN LET ME I DON'T AGREE THE IDEA THAT UNLESS WE TACKLE. THE PROBLEM THEIR ADDRESSING THAT WE SHOULDN'T DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE AT THE HEART OF THIS BILL. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR SAFE I THINK WHAT MY INTERPRETATION IS THAT THEY FEEL THAT THAT THIS FAVORS OTHER PROJECTS OVER THESE AND I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED. FOR FOR EQUAL FOOTING I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR THIS IS ACTUALLY PROVEN -- THAT WORKING LANCE CANCER QUESTOR CARBON CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. SO. I THINK THE FEELING IS THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING PUSHED ASIDE IN FAVOR OF OTHER PROGRAMS SO HOW DO WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN WE GET A COMMITMENT TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO ALLAY SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. I THINK THE REAL BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY THIS PROGRAMS AWAY NOW WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IT IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING SOMETHING IN. YOUR FAVORING SOMETHING ELSE AND AND AND PUTTING THEM ASIDE THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GET LUCK THAT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT THE INTENT AYE AYE. AYE BUT WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND HAVE A CONVERSATION BE THAT'S NOT AT ALL THE INTENT ALRIGHT WERE. VERY IMPRESSED WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND AND I THINK I THINK THE WE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO GET TO MARRY A ME IT'S ADDITIVE RIGHT IF WE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW BETTER MARY WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING I'D BE VERY INTERESTED DOING THAT YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT THAT THINK THE STRUGGLE HAS BEEN IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS SCIENCE TO SUPPORT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY HAD THE THE ABILITY TO GET FUNDING TO BE INCLUDED AND PARTS OF THESE HAS BEEN HAS BEEN REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK THE FEELING IS THAT. THAT THIS BILLIS ANOTHER BILL THAT KINDA SETS THEM ASIDE AND MAKE AND AND AND GETS THEM YET IN OTHER WORDS. I BELIEVE WHEN YOU SAY PROVEN I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE IS VERY BEEN BUT I DON'T THINK THE BILL REALLY REFLECTS THAT AT THIS POINT. SO SO WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER. TO TO TRY TO GET FUNDING FOR FOR BOTH FIVE THAT WOULD BE GREAT THAT WOULD BE MY YEAH. YEAH LOOKING AT JUST ADD A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS I THINK THANK YOU FOR SOME OF THEM ARE FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT IS THAT IF WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A SECOND AGO I THINK ALSO THERE'S AN ISSUE OF THAT THERE ARE. ABOUT IT'S A CINCH AND OTHER TOOL THE TOOL KIT RIGHT THERE MA'AM NUMEROUS TOOLS OUT THERE AT THE THE PROOF THE ACTS OF CRIME THE AG SMART CLIMATE PROGRAMS THERE THAT EXIST ARE VERY IMPORTANT NO QUICK NO DOUBT. I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR ME BEEN WORKING I THINK AS ADVOCATES I IN THAT SORT NAPA WORKING LANDS WORLD. TO THIS EVEN QUICKLY IN PASSED SEVERAL YEARS WILL PICK THIS YEAR TOO WHO I'D SORT OF CULTIVATE CHAMPIONS MEMBERS WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE PROGRAMS BOTH IN OF THE WHAT THE CURRENTLY EXISTING THAT ALSO ONES THAT MAYBE PUT IN A PLACE. I AND THERE HAS BEEN A REAL EFFORT AND TO DO PORTER AND WE ALSO HEARD OF MY MISSION ABSOLUTELY ETHNO APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE APPRECIATE CENTER ALLEN'S EFFORTS ON THE SENATE SIDE. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HEARTENING TO SEE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY MEMBERS PARTICULAR THIS YEAR. OUT WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THESE ISSUES AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO BE HAD FROM THE NATIONAL WORKING LAND SECTOR A TO HELPING SWORDFIGHTING ARE CLIMATE CHECK CHECK. CHECK CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES CHALLENGES. BUT I GUESS WHAT I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS AND YOU KNOW A COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH FOLKS ON THIS. TO MAKE THIS ADDITIVE SO THAT SO THAT. SHOULD WIN THIS BILL COMES. TO THE FLOOR OR AND THAT AND THAT THAT THAT I CAN COMFORTABLY SAY YES THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SUPPORTING. OUR OUR OUR IRAQI NETWORKING LANCE AND AND ARE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE I GUESS WHAT I HAD SAID THE THE CHALLENGE EXPOSE HIS IT IS JUST IT IT'S A A DIFFERENT BILL IT'S IT BUT THE BILL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AND I'D LOVE. TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON A IT'S I IT'S I DON'T SEE WHY THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUSIVE. AT DE MAYBE EUROPE NOW I'M CURIOUS HOW YOUR WITNESS THINKS. I DON'T SEE WHY THESE ARE EXCLUSIVE AT ALL WHEN YOU THINK THESE ARE PROVEN PROGRAMS. TO YEAH WISE IS IT WISE THIS EXCLUSIVE. YEAH I I MEAN IT DON'T HAVE I GUESS THAT YOU KNOW X. MAYBE EXACT RIGHT ANSWER FOR YOU. AT SOME OF THE REBELS ONE ADDITIONAL POINT MARK. ONE ADDITIONAL POINT I WILL THAT IS IN THIS GREAT GRAYSON THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH IS THEIRS THERE ARE NUMEROUS IT'S LEGISLATION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THIS YEAR. ONE AND ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I WANTED ITEMS THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED IS THAT SORT OF NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR RANCHERS AND FARMERS. TO AYE AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A BILL THAT IS BEING -- SPONSORED RIGHT NOW AT SOME OF THE WINS BILL THAT YOU WERE SORT OF WAYS TO TRY AND GET TO THIS ISSUE RECENTLY ISSUED THE FACT IS THE PROGRAMS EXIST AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF ALLOCATING MONEY TO THEM. WITHIN THE GINGER UP I MEAN THAT THAT AND THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE LET'S LET'S WORK ON THE ALLOCATION ACT THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU HELP ON THAT. COUNTY AND SERIOUSLY ICE UNLESS THERE'S A IT'S IT'S BEEN PUSHED ASIDE I MEAN THESE ARE THESE ARE VALUABLE PROGRAMS AND AND AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE COUNTY PARTICULAR. HAS BEEN AN INCUBATOR FOR PROGRAMS AND MENDOCINO COUNTY FOR THE IRA AND YET AND YET IT FEELS LIKE -- CERTAINLY FROM MY DISTRICT THAT THAT WE WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON YOU AND YOU DON GOAT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. AND A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON OUR WORKING SOILS THAT WE GET PUSHED ASIDE IN FAVOR OF OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND SO WHAT I'M JUST LOOKING FOR IS I'M LOOKING FOR PARTNERS. IN OTHER AREAS TO WORK WITH ME TO HELP TO ENSURE THAT THAT RURAL WORKING LANCE DON'T GET LEFT OUT. AND THAT'S WHAT'S AND THAT'S AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM COUNT ME IN ON THAT EFFORT AND I I KNOW. YOU DID YOU AYE I DON'T WANT THAT DISRUPT THEIR COOPERATION THAT STARTED TO TAKE PLACE IN HER HEART -- I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS REALLY MODELED AFTER AFTER A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE ALREADY ONE BEING THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY PROGRAM THAT DOES CLIMATE READY PROJECT. I BELIEVE UP INTO YOUR DISTRICT AND MISTER CHAIR AS WELL AS THE IN THE NEWLY CREATED FROM FUNDING LAST YEAR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD PROJECT. IT'S IT'S LOOKING TO EXPAND THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES OTHER PARTS THE STATE AND DOES ENVISIONED THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE PROGRAMS. THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS JUST VOICING BUT ALSO WILL NOT TRY TO CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF OUR DIFFERENT CONSERVANCY IS THE W. CB AND THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THEY DO SO -- WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO ADD MY THE NEXT BY PUTTING THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE [inaudible] AND THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR YEAH NAM AND AND AND IT BECAUSE BUT BUT IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T FEEL IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT CERTAINLY THE WAY IT WAS COMING THROUGH AND CERTAINLY NOT WITH THE OP. THE FROM THE OPPOSITION'S PERSPECTIVE. SO SO SO RIGHT I THINK OUR OUR THOUGHT IS THIS [inaudible] ON FROM A FROM A A STATUTORY PERSPECTIVE. THE THAT THEY'RE THE IN ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT LOOKING. FOR ANOTHER BILL REALLY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR FOR BETTER FUNDING RIGHT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A FAIR SHAKE RIGHT FRANKLY SO IT SO LET WHY DON'T OUR OFFICES CIRCLE OF TOGETHER AND TALK SHOP ABOUT HOW WE CAN ASSIST -- YOU KNOW EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A DECENT. I'M NOT A FUNDING ACTING CHAIR NOT TRYING TO HIJACK YOUR BILL YEAH I KNOW BUT I I DID YOU HAVE THE GAVEL IT'S ANYTHING THING THAT -- ANYTHING OWSLEY WORTHWHILE POINT YOU'RE BRINGING UP AND I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE FUN THAT YOU'RE OFTEN AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO HELP GET SOME FUNDING FOR THEM. APPRECIATE THAT OUT I LOOK AT WHAT THEY WERE DE EGGMAN CHAIR CAN I ADD OR SO MY IMPRESSION OF THIS. SURE ABSOLUTELY YEAH -- LISTENING TO YOUR QUESTIONS SO I FEEL LIKE I THIS IS TAUGHT AND NOT THOUGH. BUREAUCRACY ADDING ON NECESSARILY AND I THINK WE HAVE A ENOUGH ARE REGULATORY. A AGENCIES ARE AND THE PROGRAM SO IN FACT I AND AT THIS TIME I DIDN'T SEE ANY BENEFITS SELVA DESPAIR I WOULD HAVE TO POSE. THE BEAUTY OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY IF IT USES EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE SO USER CONSERVANCY'S. ARE ALIVE CONSEVATION BOARD AND EXIST. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT. OPPOSITE THE ADDITIVE TO THE BUREAUCRACY BUT I I CERTAINLY RESPECT YOUR POSITION. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MEG SO PUBLIC FOR WILL TO LOOK FORGOTTEN UPSET EARLIER STAFF WERE NOT WITH US ON THIS YES PLEASE I'M SORRY WHO. BIGELOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. HAVING FUN ACTING AS THE CHAIRMAN TODAY ARE YOU IT'S IT'S GREAT HOW IT IT'S A WONDERFUL THING. LEVEL. I THINK THE REAL CONCERN HERE AND I THINK THE CHAIRMAN WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON IT. YOU'RE REALLY ASKING FOR A NEW BILL. TO GIVE FUNDING TO EXISTING PROGRAMS. THAT DON'T HAVE IT OR FIND THEMSELVES SHORTER OF AND THE REAL OBJECTIVE OF EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE OUTLINED IN PRESENTED HERE TODAY. IS TO BUY MORE LAND. AND OUT OF THE HUNDRED ONE MILLION ACRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FARTHER CLOSER 252% OF THE STATE IS ALREADY PUBLICLY ON AND WHEN YOU START RATCHETING THAT DOWN. THERE'S LESS AND LESS FOR EVERYBODY TO ENJOY IN THIS STATE BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS. THAT'S A FACT BY THE PUBLICLY OWNED MEANS THAT WE ALL ARE ABLE TO ENJOY. THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT PUBLICLY REALLY LAND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED ON THOSE LANDS. THERE'S REGULATIONS AT BAND PEOPLE NOT OUT LOUD ON HIGHLAND THAT THERE. PRIVATE LANDS ARE PRIVATE LANDS OWNED BY THE INDIVIDUALS THEY HAVE RIGHTS. THAT MUST BE RESPECTED. AS WE CONTINUE GOING DOWN THIS PROCESS WE'RE SEEING MORE MORE THE FARMLAND. CONSUMED BY THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES. TAKE HIM OFF THE BOOKS AND NO LONGER SEQUESTERING AND DOING THE POSITIVE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. CREATING PROBLEMS FORCE. MUCH LIKE THE FIRE THAT'S BURNING RIGHT NOW AT ELEVEN THOUSAND PLUS ACRES. THAT HASN'T BEEN WELL MANAGED BY THE PUBLIC AGENCIES. WE'RE GETTING MORE POLLUTION IN THE AIR. NO NOT SEQUESTERING. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A WHILE ONE IS RIGHT HERE. AND AND REALLY TAKE THE STAND BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT MISTER WOOD WAS CITING. AND SEE HOW WE CAN BETTER DO IT WITHIN THE CAN FIND MUCH OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY'VE BEEN. JUST SOME THOUGHTS RHETORICAL NOT REQUIRING AN ANSWER ANYONE ELSE. WOULD YOU LIKE. THE MOTION MISTER SO I CAN FIND THIS RUBIO MISSED MISTER ALLEN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE.

GLORIA AYE HARPER. HARPER NO KALRA. LEVINE. MATHIS KNOW ABOUT THE SNOW RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SALAS WOULD I WOULD I FOR THE FOR COULD YOU NEVER SPENT A WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS HERE THOUGH I DON'T WORK. AND GOING THAT'S ANNOUNCED ALRIGHT THIS IS EXCITING. SO MEMBERS I THINK YOU AND NEXT WE'RE GONNA. TALK ABOUT S. B.. TEN SEVENTEEN WHICH SEEKS. TO INCENTIVIZE CONFERENCE SWORDFISH FISHING INDUSTRY. I THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM HARMFUL DRIFT GILL NETS TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE GEAR TYPES SUCH AS DEEP THAT BILLY GREER SYSTEMS. I WHICH IS STILL BY ESTABLISHING A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO BUY BACK STATE. DRIFT ON THAT PERMITS IN LARGE MASTER IF GILLNETS. USING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS. THE FISHERMEN WHO CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BUY BACK PROGRAM WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO USE DRIFT ON THAT GEAR FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. BUT AFTER THAT THESE NOTS WILL BE PHASED OUT. I THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- SOME OF THE MEMBERS WILL BE AWARE OF THIS BUT THAT BASICALLY THESE. THESE GNATS THAT THAT TRIAL THE OCEAN CAPTURING KILL DOLPHINS WHALES SEA TURTLE SO MANY MORE THREATEN ENDANGERED SPECIES AND I WANNA BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THIS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE. BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE BEST DATA WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA. BASED SWORDFISH DRIFT GILL NET FISH WE CAUGHT SEVEN FIFTY THREE DOLPHINS FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN SEALS AND SEA LIONS UNDER TWELVE SEA BIRDS FIFTY THREE WELLS. THIRTY FIVE SEA TURTLES -- ACCORDING TO THEIR DATA. IS THE NATIONAL MARINE FISH SEASON FISHERIES SERVICE ALL OF THE DATA DOLPHINS WERE KILLED. AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE LARGE WHALES TURTLES AND SEE LINE'S ESCAPE WITHOUT SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IN ADDITION. OVER HUNTER FIFTY THOUSAND FISH INCLUDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SHARKS. WERE THROWN OVERBOARD AND THERE OFTENTIMES THROWN OVERBOARD VERY DAMAGED. NOW OPPONENTS POINT TO A SINGLE YEAR'S DATA WHERE THE DRIFT ON OFFICIALLY CAPTOR RELEASED A LIVE. 94% OF THEIR CATCH THAT SAME YEAR 90% OF THE FISHERY WAS UNOBSERVED. BY NOAH AND THE NATIONAL. OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC MINISTRATION FISHERIES AND THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW THE RELEASED ANIMALS FARED AFTER EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA INJURY. OF CAPTURE AND DRIFT GILL NETS. LET'S BE CLEAR EVEN A 10% THAT'S HUNDREDS OF DEAD ANIMALS DISCARDED OVERBOARD INCLUDING DOLPHINS BLUE SHARKS VALUABLE SPORT FISH. LIKE MARLINS AND TUNA CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY ALLOW THIS GEAR STILL EVEN THE UNITED NATIONS IS BAN ON INTERNATIONAL WATERS. A WERE USUALLY THE LEADER ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES THIS IS -- THIS TIME MORE ACTION ONE OF THE LAST USING THIS OUTDATED YEAR AND IT'S TIME THAT WE CHANGE THIS. I S. B. TEN SEVENTEEN AS A BALANCE REGIONAL APPROACH TO ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY TO TRANSITION TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE GEAR WE JUST RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THE FISHING GAME. I COMMISSION AND WE ALSO HAVE VERY STRONG SUPPORT FROM -- A LARGE NUMBER OF SPORTS FISHERMEN AND OTHER -- RECREATIONAL FISHER. AND FISHING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ANGLERS ASSOCIATION. SO I WANNA ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY ENCOURAGED AND I THINK MY STAFFER TINA FOR WORKING REALLY HARD OVER THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE'VE BEEN HAVING. SOME INTENSE I MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE FLEET. ABSENT SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE -- OVER [inaudible] CAPTAIN -- YOU KNOW -- BUT THEY'VE BEEN MEETING TO DISCUSS THE BILL AND SEE YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME COMMON GROUND THAT CAN BE FOUND. OUT TO HELP TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE INCENTIVES THAT THEY NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE TRANSITIONING THEIR FLEET Y. I CERTAINLY AM HOPEFUL THAT THESE TALKS WILL BE PRODUCTIVE SO. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY FELLOW COAUTHORS ON THIS COMMITTEE MUST NOT MISS KOREA MISTER CHIU MISS FRIEDMAN. MISTER GLORIA MISTER LEVINE. I'M I'VE GOT WITH ME HERE ATTIRE BROCA'S FROM THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUST HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG LONG TIME. A BILL SHOT WITH THE COASTAL CAN CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA THEIR NIPPLES SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PLEASE GO AHEAD. MOTION A SECOND PLEASE REQUIRE HAD [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHAT ABOUT YOU CHAIRMAN AND? COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BILL SHED ON THE A FOUNDING BOARD CHAIRMAN OF THE COASTAL CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION. A FOR THIRTY YEARS I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN SPORTFISHING ASSOCIATIONS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE -- CURRENTLY EMIT A BOARD MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL GAME FISH ASSOCIATION IN A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF THE WILD OCEANS. SO SPECIFICALLY I'M REPRESENTING THOSE FOUR GROUPS BUT MORE BROADLY I'M REPRESENTING THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SALTWATER ANGLERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE MANY BUSINESSES THAT. THE WORKING TO PROTECT THE THE MARINE RESOURCE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ANGLERS. SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR STEPPING UP AND AND AND PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER TO BITS. LONG OVERDUE A HIS LEADERSHIP IS GOING TO HELP TO NOT ONLY PROTECT THE COAST. BUT ALSO PROTECT BUSINESSES AND NOT OFTEN DEFINE BILLS IT THAT THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE RESOURCE IN THE COAST AND ALSO BUSINESS THIS ONE DOES. I AM WAY TOO FAMILIAR. WITH JEFF GILLNETS. AND I'LL CONVEY THAT IN A BRIEF STORY [inaudible] NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE LONGTIME GILLNET CAPTAIN. CAME TO ME WITH VIDEO THAT HE TOOK ON HIS BOAT THE LAST FOUR MONTHS CITY FINISHED. AND WHAT WAS ON THAT VIDEO IS WHAT THE CENTER JUST DESCRIBED. A DEAD ONE DID WELL NUMEROUS DOLPHINS [inaudible] SHARKS MARLON TURTLES IN A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER FISH. CAUGHT IN FOUR MONTHS. THE REASON HE DID THIS. HE SAYS BILL I DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE. I'M GETTING OUT OF THIS BUSINESS. AND IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS THIS TO SHOW THE DAMAGE. AND WHAT THE REST THE WORLD TO KNOW WHAT I'M TURN THIS FOOTAGE OVER YOU. AND I JUST ASK THAT YOU MAKE IT AVAILABLE SO THAT OTHERS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WITH WITH THE USE OF GILLNETS. NOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER WE FINALLY. WE FINALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND TO REMOVE THIS GEAR. FROM THE COAST [inaudible] THE PACIFIC. FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL SPENT MANY MANY MANY YEARS TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND TRUST ME I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS STUFF FOR A LIFETIME. IT'S A PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS A SOLUTION. THEY CAME UP WITH UP BE PROVED A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE FORCED TO FLEE TO THE FISH CLEAN. OR GO AWAY. WELL. THAT WAS A THAT WAS A GREAT EFFORT BUT LAST SUMMER NO FISHERIES PULL THAT OFF THE TABLE. SO HERE WE ARE TODAY WERE FORCED BACK TO SQUARE. ONE AND THIS BILL WILL HELP TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. SO S. B. TEN SEVENTEEN IT'S FAIR IT'S REASONABLE. IT ADDRESSES THE OVERRIDING ISSUE OF REDUCING BYCATCH AND THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE HERE THERE'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH BYCATCH. THE COMPENSATES FISHERMEN FOR SURRENDERING THE GILL NETS IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY WITH DEEP SET BUOY YEAR TO A NEW MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE TYPE OF FISHING GEAR -- AND TRY TO STAFF YOU ALL TO JOIN. NOT ONLY ME BUT THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN THE STATE MANY BUSINESSES LIKE MY OWN. THE REALLY NEED THIS TO TAKE PLACE SO THANK YOU. INVESTMENT THINK IT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TARA BROCK WITH THAT FEW TERRIBLE TRUSTS. FIRST WE ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WOULD TRANSITION CALIFORNIA SWORDFISH FISHERY. AWAY FROM THE USE OF DRIFT ALL THAT GEAR WHICH ACCORDING TO A PEW COMMISSION PAUL IS SUPPORTED BY 87% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THE GOOD NEWS AS YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVE COMMENTS DEVELOPED BY THE PFLEGER INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH IN OCEANSIDE WITH FUNDING FROM THE STATE'S OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. AND FROM PEW AMONG OTHERS. PIERRE BEGAN DEVELOPING DEEP SEPARATE YOUR TO TARGET START FISH OFF THE WEST COAST AND TWENTY TEN THE RESULTS ARE OUTSTANDING WITH 98%. OF THEM OF THE CATCH BEING MARKETABLE AND A VAST MAJORITY OF THE CATCH BEING SORT FETCH. ESSENTIALLY PIERRE FIGURED OUT HOW TO TARGET SWORDFISH DURING THE DAY WHEN THEY'RE FEEDING BY THEMSELVES AND COLD DEEP WATER AWAY FROM THE OTHER SPECIES AT THE SURFACE THAT OFTEN -- AND UP AND JUST GO NUTS. DEEP SEPARATE HERE HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN WATERS OFF CALIFORNIA FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS THIS IS PROVIDED OVER A THOUSAND FISHING DAYS WORTH OF DATA WHICH EQUATES TO OVER. EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS OF ON THE WATER TRIALS. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO PROFITABLY CUT SWORDFISH AT COMMERCIAL RATES WITH MINIMAL BI CATCH WHILE ACTIVE TENDING OF THE GEAR HAS LED TO A 100% OF THE BY CATCH RELEASED ALIVE WITHIN MINUTES. FURTHER BOYCOTT SWORDFISH CAN GET NEARLY DOUBLE THE PRICE OF SORT FISH CAUGHT WOULD TRIP DOWN THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT PRODUCT AND THE ABILITY TO FISH AT TIMES AND IN AREAS WHERE DRAFT ON THAT FISHING IS RESTRICTED DUE TO CONSERVATION CONCERNS. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CAN BE MEMBERS OF THE DRAFT ON THAT FLEET AND THE NGO COMMUNITY WITH THE INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A PILE OF STATE DRIFT ON THAT PERMITS. Q. PARTICIPATED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS CONVERSATIONS AND WE WERE HOPEFUL THAT A RESOLUTION COULD BE FOUND BUT A PACKAGE WAS NEVER FINALIZED. AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING A PATH FORWARD THAT TRANSITIONS CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM THE YOU SUBJECT GóMEZ WHILE OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FISHERMEN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR ALLEN. THE INDUSTRY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB TEN SEVENTEEN TODAY AND AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME'S LEO SEARCHES WITH SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION FROM LOS ANGELES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TEN SEVENTEEN WERE ALSO WORKING TO HELP PRODUCE WELL AND SEALED TURTLE ENTANGLEMENTS.

HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEN WILL ON THE RESIDENT FREMONT CALIFORNIA AND A VOLUNTEER WITH VARIOUS CONSERVATION GROUPS AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE DOES ANYONE IN OPPOSITION SORRY SORRY FOR THE DELAY. BROUGHT ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND SEAFOOD INSTITUTE A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL FISHING ORGANIZATIONS. A NUMBER OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE FROM COASTAL AREAS. IT'S IT'S ALMOST AMAZING HOW THIS ISSUE HAS BALLOONED INTO SUCH A IT'S A BIG ISSUE. THE FISHERMEN ARE REGULATEDBY THE NATIONAL IN FISHERIES SERVICE AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS. OF THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. WE SPEND AN HOUR ON A BILL THEY SPEND FOUR DAYS. A EVERY OTHER MONTH ON THESE ISSUES. I'VE HANDED OUT A FACT SHEET. THAT ACTUALLY EXPLAINS WHAT WE ARE DOING. AND ON THE SECOND PAGE YOU'LL SEE. THE IMPACTS ON MARINE MAMMALS. THE NATIONAL IN FISHERIES SERVICE PREPARED TO DOCUMENT. AND MANY DOCUMENTS. AND THE NATIONALLY FISHERIES SERVICE IS THE PLATINUM STANDARD. A FISHERY MANAGEMENT IN THE WORLD. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME IN FACT SEATED. THE AUTHORITY TO THEM. IT'S A HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES. AND THAT IS ALL TAKING PLACE IN FEDERAL WATERS. THE NAZARIAN FISHERIES SERVICE. HAS HAS -- RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S BECOME UNUSUAL. FOR TURTLES LARGE WHALES AND OTHER MARINE MAMMALS TO BE INJURED OR KILLED IN A DRIFT GILL NET FISHERY. DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE OF THE SECOND PAGE OF I GAVE YOU. AND YOU'LL SEE THE IMPACTS ON ALL BEAKED WHALES. BY THE CALIFORNIA DRIFT GILL NET FISHERY FROM. NINETEEN NINETY TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND YOU'LL NOTICE IT'S GONE FROM A HIGH OF SOME. FIFTY ANIMALS TO VIRTUALLY NOTHING. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE IMPACTS ON SHORT BE COMMON DOLPHINS. HAS GONE FROM AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED TO AS LITTLE AS TEN WHY DID THIS HAPPEN. BECAUSE OF THE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE NATURAL FISHERIES SERVICE. THROUGH THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. THEY DETERMINED THAT TO AVOID TAKING SEA TURTLES AND I'LL MENTION THAT WOULD ONE SEA TURTLE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. BY OBSERVERS FROM THE NATIONALLY FISHERIES SERVICE HAS BEEN TAKEN SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY NINE ONE AND THE THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE TURTLE CONSERVATION AREA. WHICH IS A HUGE AREA OF THE OCEAN. WAS MADE OFF LIMITS AND WITH A FISHERMAN SUPPORT. TO USING DRIFT GILL NETS IN THAT AREA WHEN THE TURTLES ARE COMING OR GOING [inaudible] THE FISHERMEN AND THE MANAGERS DEVELOPED MESH SIZE MANAGEMENT SO THAT ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF ANIMALS ARE TAKEN THOSE ARE SWORDFISH [inaudible] NOT MARLON [inaudible] SHARK. OPALA LIEU OF OUR TUNERS. WE CALL THE MARKET NETS THEY BRING IN FRESH FISH. TO SOME THIRTY NINE MILLION CONSUMERS WHO MIGHT ENJOY SEAFOOD. WE HAVE AREA CLOSURES WE HAVE TIME CLOSURES WE HAVE THE THE NUMBER OF CONSERVATION MEASURES IN PLACE [inaudible] THAT HAVE. SO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE TAKE OF INCIDENTAL. CATCH OR OR A MARINE MAMMALS CETACEANS. PINNIPEDS AND THE TURTLES A TURTLE TAKE A COURSE IS VIRTUALLY NOTHING HOW DO WE DO THAT IN ADDITION. THE NETS ARE NO LONGER ON THE SURFACE. WE'VE DROPPED THEM THIRTY SIX BELOW THE SURFACE. WHERE THE FISH ARE AND THE MARINE MAMMALS ARE NOT? THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE SAID WE HAVE A GREAT IDEA WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION YOU WERE GOING TO BUY YOU OFFER BY YOU OUT. NEVER GONNA TRANSITION YOU TO TYPESET WEEK HERE. IT'S NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S NOT EVEN AUTHORIZED BY THE NATIONAL RATE FISHERIES SERVICE THEY HAVE SOME EXPERIMENTAL. WORK THAT IS BEING DONE. BUT HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN USE DEEP SET BUT WE CARE. YOU DON'T CATCH THE SHARK THE LOOP ARE THE OPA THE TUNERS. SO IN ESSENCE YOU MAKE FIVE TIMES LESS MONEY. USING THE DEEP SEPARATE HERE AS YOU DO YOU SING THE NETS WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S CATCH FISH. AND THAT IS WHAT THESE THAT'S TO THE WAY EVERY OTHER NET US. IT WAS TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE THE TAKE OF OF MARINE MAMMALS AND OTHER THINGS. AND THEN LASTLY. SENATOR I BELIEVE SAID. THAT THAT WE ARE TRAWLING THE OCEAN WITH THESE NETS THESE NETS ARE STATIONARY THEY'RE HOOKED OF THE BOAT AND THE DRAFT RIGHT BEHIND THE VOTE. WE ARE NOT TRAWLING THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF NET. THE DIFFERENT FISHERY THE CATCHES DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH. AND LASTLY THE THEY SAY THEY HAVE MONIES. TWO TRANSITION THE FISHERMEN. SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVE A FISHERMAN WHOSE FISH FOR FORTY YEARS. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS GO WAY GOOD LUCK ON GETTING THESE EXPERIMENTAL PERMITS. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. MONEY THERE'S NO MONEY. THERE IS NO MONEY IN THIS BILL THERE'S NO FUNDING IN THIS BILL. FOR THE FISHERMEN. NOR TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SELL TO PROCESSOR. AND THE PLANT WORKERS. THEY WON'T HAVE SEAFOOD IF THIS BILL GOES THROUGH. SO THEY'D TAKE US DOWN OF A ROAD. WITH THE NOTHING AT THE END OF THE ROAD. AND WE ASK YOU KNOW VOTE. OTHER OTHER WITNESSES I COULD YEAH -- THE MORNING HAVE TO BEAR WITH NO NAMES AUSTIN BROWN OF THE FISHERMEN BEAR WITH ME IT'S MY FIRST TIME SO I DIDN'T GREAT NO PROBLEM. THIS IS A CATEGORY TWO FISHERY. WHICH IS IT'S IS SUBSTANTIALLY CLEAN ITSELF AND WE'VE BEEN -- A GENTLEMAN EARLIER SAID THAT AND IN -- NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAT THE IT WAS A VIDEO AND THIS GUY SAID HE HAD A CONSCIENCE WHILE AND IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN FINGERS AND EXTENDERS WERE. WERE -- APPLIED IMPLEMENTED INTO THE NETS AND THE NETS WERE A BASICALLY THEY THEY EXTENDED THEM AND THEY PUT TEN YEARS THAT THAT -- PUSHED MARINE MAMMALS AWAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE ATTRACTED TO IT. NOT THERE ANYWAY BUT NO MY MY FAMILY OWNS. A COMPANY AND IN SAN DIEGO OR I'M FOURTH GENERATION FISHING AND WE'VE. COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THAT FISHERY. AND I'M THIRTY YEARS OLD I PLAN ON DOING THIS FOR THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS AT LEAST -- SO THIS IF THIS BILL PASSES ON UNSCREWED BASICALLY -- BUT I WANTED I WANTED YOU KNOW. THE YOU NOT A TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE THINGS -- OR ONE ONE MAJOR THING -- THE SENATOR IN THE SUPPORTERS -- HAVE EXTRA AT HAVE BULLIED THE FLEET. AND TO THE POINT WHERE GUYS WON'T SHOW UP -- THREE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE GOTTEN DEATH THREATS. UP FROM THE SUPPORT AND THEIR WIVES -- THERE'S SOMETHING THAT -- IS ATTACHED TWO DID YOU GIVE THIS YEAH -- IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D I'D LIKE TO READ IT THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU -- THIS ACTUALLY I WAS AT THE PACIFIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL -- UP IN IN SPOKANE RECENTLY AND A WHEAT WE SHARE THIS WITH THE COUNCIL -- ON MAY TWENTY FOURTH AN ARTICLE IN THE MARIN INDEPENDENT JOURNAL. WHICH PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE FISHERMEN AND THE VESSEL LOCATIONS -- ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH ONE OF OUR MEMBERS GARY BURKE I RECEIVED A DEATH THREAT SHORTLY AFTER THIS APPEARANCE HIS APPEARANCE. ON THE ON THE NBC -- NBC NEWS RELATED TO S. B. TENS TEN SEVENTEEN WITH THE SENATOR. OF THE FISHING VESSEL BOTCH IT ONE OF THE VESSELS MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE ARTICLE -- AND USE THE NEGATIVE PROPAGANDA VIDEO SANK AT THE DOCK. ON JUNE SECOND UNDER CSUS A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S BEING INVESTED BY INVESTED ABOUT THE COAST GUARD AND HOMELAND SECURITY -- ACTUALLY WAS SABOTAGED THE BOAT WAS SUNK WITH BY A THROUGH HOLE. ARMED THE CAMERAMEN ON THE ABOVE ARE TRUE AND OTHER VESSELS UTILIZING THE ATTACK ON THE FISH WE GAINED ACCESS TO THE VESSEL. UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AND IS ANOTHER PERMIT HOLDER. WE AWARE OF THESE INCIDENTS AND DON'T ASSUME THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES. AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. AT A DIRECT RESULT OF THE REPEATED ATTACKS ON CERTAIN GROUPS -- VILIFYING THE DRIFT GILL NET FISHERY AND THE FISHERMEN. WE BELIEVE THIS MAY HAVE AMPLE THE ECO TERRORIST FOR SEEKING VIGILANTE JUSTICE AND I'D BUY BIG PLEASE DON'T. FEES NO VOTE ON THIS BILL SO THANK YOU. OTHERS THAT YOU WANTED. DUMP ON DEMOCRATS ON FISH AND SWORDFISH FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS. I'M ALSO A DEEP SET BURGER FISHERMEN DEL. AND ON THAT EXPERIMENTAL FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS NOW [inaudible] A IT'S HAS SOME POTENTIAL BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GET NEGATIVES IT'S NOT GOING TO SUPPORT A BIG BOAT. AT ALL IT'S JUST THERE THEY'RE NOT. YOU CAN'T AND YOU GOTTA DRIVE UP ON THESE VERGE THEY CAN BACK UP WHAT WE DO. SO THEY NEED ANOTHER ANOTHER AVENUE [inaudible] AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. A ALSO WITH THE DEEP SEPARATE YOUR RIGHT NOW IT'S A THE EFP. THE FDA'S ARE HANDED OUT TO ANYBODY. YOU GUYS CAN GET. AND WERE TOTALLY AGAINST THAT THE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY ADDRESSED -- THAT FOR THE GILL NET FISHERMEN. THEY WANT TO TRANSITION OF THAT. BECAUSE LEFT THEM OUT OF IT BUT THE THE FDA'S OTHER STUDENTS TO DENNIS. WITH SANTA BARBARA. THERE'S TO RUSSIANS THAT AREN'T EVEN US CITIZENS THAT DEBT RECEIVE THESE YUPPIES. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT. SIXTY OF PEAS ARE GONNA DO WHEN WE HAVE A LIMITED IT WE WERE A NOW LIVE IN A TREE WERE LIMITED ENTRY ON THE YOUNG THAT FISHERY. AND THEN WE WANT TO HAVE AN OPEN ACCESS. TO THREE IT'S JUST IT'S IT DOESN'T DOESN'T WORK WHEN ANYTHING'S HANDED OUT FOR FREE. PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY. TAKE IT TOO WELL IT IS DO WHAT THEY WANT WITH IT. SO WHAT I DO THINK IT WOULD THAT COULD BE PUT IN THE BILL AND STRESSED THAT -- IS FOR THE SORT FISHERMEN THAT ARE THAT ARE GONNA. PROTECT OUR FISHERY TRY TO GET A GOOD MARKET PRICE FOR IT. AND NOT USES AS A TAX WRITE OFF LIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD. I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT. ALSO IS THAT -- AS THE BILL STANDS NOW. BUT ON THE BUY OUT I DON'T THINK OF MANY. ACTIVE SORT VETERANS WILL GO FOR IT. A A DISTANT KEEPOD FISHING. AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS THANK YOU. AND IT AND I SAID FAIRNESS TO THE PROPONENTS AYE AYE. THE NEXT ONE IS JUST YOUR NAME AND FOR THAT I'M SORRY IDEA. WE HAD WE HAD TWO WITNESSES APPEAR AND I'VE GIVEN AN OPTION TO SPEAK SO THAT'S FINE TIMOLOL QUE IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION YOU KNOW. SEEN KNOWN WILL BRING IT BACK -- TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER HARPER. IF YOU CAN HELP ME OUT. SOME ISSUES CYCLE AND RECYCLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN [inaudible] AND WHEN I SAW THIS BILL I WAS THINKING I REMEMBER THIS ISSUE BEFORE. THIS WAS ISSUED BY ADDRESSED BY THE VOTERS BACK IN. NINETEEN NINETY SO JUST DESSERT FOR LOGISTICS DO WE HAVE FOR OPPOSITION INDEPENDENT DEFENSE GRAFTON. WITNESSES BUT SO BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ON THE CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION. ONE THIRTY TWO THERE WAS ON THE BALLOT. A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO PROHIBIT -- GILL NETS. BOB PROPOSITION ONE THIRTY TO BAN THE USE A GILL NETS AND TRAVEL THAT'S BEGINNING IN JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY FOUR COASTAL. WATERS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I IMPOSE ADDITIONAL FEES EXCEPT FOR SO IF YOU CAN HELP EXPLAIN. WHY IS THIS BILL DIFFERENT? THEN EXISTING LAW -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT MOST VOTERS MAY PERCEIVE HAY HAVEN'T WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ALREADY WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS ABOUT. YEAH BUT I'D LOVE TO TAKE THAT BECAUSE I'M. THE AND IN -- NINETEEN NINETY THERE IS AN EFFORT BY DORIS ALLEN TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE A BAN ON SET NET SO THAT THE INSHORE GILLNET STILL THE SAME BASIC PICKING TYPE TO GILL NET. AND UP THERE WE HAD A COMMITTEE OF SEVEN PEOPLE. I WAS ONE OF THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE THAT DROVE THAT EFFORT WE ULTIMATELY WENT -- TO TO THE PROPOSITION BECAUSE WE CAN GET IT DONE THROUGH THE STATE. AND SITTING HERE TODAY LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE TALK. IT BRINGS ME BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN NINETY ONE WE DID IT WITH THE INSHORE GONE THAT'S SO MUCH SMOKE IN MIRRORS SO MUCH MORE. FAULT INFORMATION ABOUT THE HORRORS OF KNOW HOW HORRIBLE WILL BE IF WE GET RID OF THESE ENSURE GILLNETS WHICH WE DID WITH PROPOSITION. ONE THIRTY TWO THAT THAT THAT KEEPS THE GILL NETS OUT OF THE YEAR CALIFORNIA WATERS OUT TO THREE MILES. IT'S THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN BUT IT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S A SIMILAR DEAR BOTH IGGY ARNETT OF BOTH THE GILL NET. THE TYPE OF UNITS WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW OR THAT DRIFT GILL NETS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOAT. THAT ARE TARGETED TO CATCH LARGER -- NEAR SHORE GILL NETS WERE TO CATCH SMALLER FISH INSHORE -- BOTH HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE. KNOWN TO BE HIGH DESTRUCTIVE IN IN DAMAGING TO THE RESOURCE THAT'S WHY EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION HAS BANNED THE USE OF DRIFT GILL NETS. EVERYONE. SO IF I CAN CLARIFY SO. THAT BALLOT INITIATIVE CARE OF GILL NETS WITHIN THREE MILES WITH IN STATE WATERS. IS THIS TRYING TO IMPOSE A CALIFORNIA STANDARD ON FEDERAL WATERS COMPLETE PLEASE HELP CLARIFY NO IT'S REALLY PUT IS POSING A A STANDARD ON A SIMILAR GEAR TYPE USED IN A DIFFERENT WAY. A DRIFT NET AS OPPOSED TO A SET NET. SO THIS BILL IS SUPPOSED TO ONLY. THE OTHER THIS BILL DOES NOT IT WATERS OR HAD FOR FEDERAL WATERS. IN FEDERAL WATERS. OUT AT TWO HUNDRED MILES WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE TO IN MILES WE CAN'T -- WE CAN'T CONTROL HERE WE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER FEDERAL WATERS FOR A FOR A FOR A BILL. YES UNDER UNDER THE THE CONSORTIUM THAT [inaudible] DATE ADDED. THAT THE FISH BUSIED THIS FISHERIES CONSORTIUM WE DO HAVE WE GET POWER. TO DO THIS ENTERTAINING. I THAT HAD. HOW CONSULTANT FEDERAL SOURCES ON? BIGGEST HARPER OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISH TO ASK QUESTIONS OF DUCK CHOI. THANK YOU ARE LISTENING TO A BOOK SIZE SO I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FISHERIES INDUSTRY AND UP PARTICULARLY -- KID AT THE IN FACT SO. BUT THEY ARE LISTENING TO YOU. IDEA. HAVE A QUESTION NOT REGARDING THE THE DROP WELL OF WAY THOSE ARE AND ARE NOW DOLPHIN. CAUGHT BY IDEAS ARE. ARE GETTING AT THE FISHING. IT HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY -- Y. THE NUMBER. OUR IS GOING DOWN -- THAT WOULD BE MY OF FIRST QUESTION NOT TWO OPPONENTS ARE AND THEN NOT IF FOR THIS IS TRUE. DATA INCORRECT DATA THEN NOT WHY WOULD THIS BE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY OUT KNOCKED ASK -- ON SENATOR I'M NOT OUT. CAN YOU ANSWER FIRST THOUGHT WHY HE THANK YOU HOWARD LISTA TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION -- I'D ADD THAT THE MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS HAVE EXPLODED. IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT WE HAVE GONE DOWN TO VIRTUALLY NO TAKE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE P. AREA RESTRICTIONS THE SENT OF THE NET FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. BY SOME FORTY FEET BY MESH SIZE MANAGEMENT. BY AREA CLOSURE BY PINNERS WHICH MAKE NOISES. THAT LED THE WHALES IN THE OTHER CETACEANS KNOW. THERE'S SOMETHING. HERE THAT YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO AND THEY AVOID IT. SO IT'S WORKING WITH THE MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE WITH THE BIOLOGISTS IN THE MANAGERS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS DRAMATIC REDUCTION. THAT THAT ALL SOUNDS VERY GOOD. BUT THE THE REASON THAT THE METAL TAKE IS DOWN [inaudible] IS. LOOK AT THE NUMBER SOARED FISH WERE CAUGHT IN IN AT THE HEIGHT. OVER TWO THOUSAND METRIC TONS TODAY. SEVENTY EIGHT METRIC TONS. SO THE THE THE THE ACTIVITY. IT'S GONE WAY DOWN. AND SO YOU ABOUT LESS FISH CAUGHT AND YOU'VE GOT LESS MAMMALS CUTS NOT NOT THAT THE KITCHEN NECESSARY THE KITCHEN SO ME LESS MAMMALS PER SET. THERE'S JUST A LOT LESS SETS OUT THERE BECAUSE AS IT SHOULD BE THAT WHOLE EFFORT HAS BEEN SQUEEZED DOWN AS IT SHOULD BE. I KNOW THE FOLKS COMPUTER BEEN STUDYING THIS AND HAVE SOME DATA. SURE YEAH THEN I MEAN WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE FLEET HAS -- MADE EFFORTS TO REDUCE BI CATCH AND PINNERS WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT REDUCING BEAKED WHALE CATCH. I'M NOT ONLY HAS THE EFFORT ON DOWN BUT WE ARE STILL SEEN HUNDREDS OF DOLPHINS AND OTHER MAMMALS CAUGHT IN THIS FISHERY I THINK US UNDER ALAN GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS IN THE BEGINNING -- THE FLEET HAS MADE EFFORTS BUT WE'RE STILL SEEING THESE REALLY HIGH UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL THE BY CATCH FURTHER ONLY LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE SETS IN THIS FISHERY. HAVE BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS ON AVERAGE SO WE ARE NOT. CERTAIN ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE OTHER FOUR SETS THAT ARE NOT CARING I'M BORN OBSERVERS ALL WE KNOW IS WHAT WE SEE THROUGH OBSERVER COVERAGE AND CAN EXTRAPOLATE OR DO OUR BEST GAS AT ESTIMATING. WHAT THE BY CATCH IS IN THIS FISHERY SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE STILL LINGERING GOOD. SO WHICH STARTED CHOI IDEA HOW WOULD ADDRESS DATA IS THAT CORRECT THAT ONCE I SAYS HAVE VERY LITTLE. NOW YOU SAY THE US ARE STILL A LOT. I THINK THAT'S UP TO US TO DECIDE [inaudible] RIGHT. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT TAKES ON THAT ON THOSE ON THOSE ISSUES. VISIT DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER HOUSE YEAH ASYLUM THERE QUESTION OFFICE AND OTHER GOT SAVED LAST THEY'RE GONNA YEAH IT'S NOT ARE RIGHT. I REALLY IN THE ANALYSIS THAT -- OF THIS IS SO ON THE UP MAKING OUR U. S. OUT OF FISHING INDUSTRY UP MORE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE SOUGHT. HOW WELL THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE USING THE SAME GILET NOT TECHNIQUES AND THAT THEY ARE SENDING [inaudible] FISH. BACK TO US. OF COURSE BY THE SAME INDUSTRY. SO ARE WE ARE. UP MAKING OUR US. OF FISHING INDUSTRY AND DISADVANTAGES TO FOR ENOUGH. FISHERIES WELL I MEAN THE THE HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WILL PROVIDE A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY OF ALLOWING THE FISHERY TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE. THAT'S BEEN THE WORK THAT PEWS MORE CONFRONTATION ALSO SAY THAT WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OF THE OF LOTS OF FISHERMEN WHO ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. YEAH ZONES OUT A LOT OF OTHER OF FISHERMEN SO. FAR YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE KNOW WE BY THE WAY THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN. ADRIFT ON THAT'S GLOBALLY -- ON INTERNATIONAL WATERS NOW WHAT WE KNOW OBVIOUSLY NOT AT THAT. APPLY WITH EVERYWHERE -- SO THERE IT BUT BUT IT IS IT IS IT IS OUR WILL THAT THE THE WHOLE PLAN HERE IS TO HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION TO THIS OTHER TYPE. HERE WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE. THEIR WORK NOW ON I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS RAISED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHO WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE DOES USE. THE DEEP SIBUK AREAS THAT WE NEED TO POWER I THINK PART OF THE DEAL THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STRIKE HERE ULTIMATELY BOTH IN TERMS OF A BOOK AND IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY AND IN FIGURING OUT ABOUT A GOOD SWEET SPOT TO HELP. PUT PEOPLE ON A SPINSTER ON PLACE TO BE ABLE TRANSITION OFF WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS PERMITS ISSUE -- SO THAT WE DON'T AND THAT IS THAT WE REALLY GIVE -- THE FISHERMEN WHO ARE TRANSITIONING PRIORITY AND WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW GIVING THESE OTHER FOLKS [inaudible] I YEAH THE RIGHT TO COME IN AND I AND AND AND AND AND YOU USE OUR FISHERIES IRRESPONSIBLY SO ON THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IN THE IN THE COURSE THE NEGOTIATION. BUT I'D LIKE I ENJOYED YOU HAVE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ON THIS A DOCTOR TRADE YET ANOTHER QUESTIONER US IT OKAY THANK [inaudible] AB [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN.

IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE DEPARTMENT -- OVER A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS PURCHASE THIS ALAMEDA TOUGH LOVE PROPERTY. ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT HAS BEEN MIRED IN CONTROVERSY EVER SINCE. THIS BILL THAT'S OF INFO BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES NOT MANDATE ANYTHING. DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE ACTIVITY OF OFF ROAD RIDING. AND IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE CURRENT OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARK. EVERYTHING REMAINS THE SAME. IT SIMPLY GIVES THE PARKS DEPARTMENT THE OPTION. TO SELL THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION AREA IF THEY DECIDE IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. AND THE AND BY DOING SO RETURNING MONEY TO THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE FUND. FROM WHICH IT ORIGINATED. THE ONLY CONDITION IS THAT THIS LAND BE PERMANENTLY PRESERVE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES IF THEY CHOSE THAT OPTION. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY TWENTY FIVE LOCAL.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TECH HOUSTON REPRESENTING THE AFOREMENTIONED EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WE TOURED SUPPORT -- ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. YES PLEASE COME FORWARD PROCEED I'M NOT SURE WHO'S GOING FIRST YOU ALTHOUGH FIRST MR MCHALE IF YOU'D LIKE TO CO ANCHOR YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN REGAN ASSOCIATES. REPRESENTING THE COALITION OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATIONAL STE. ALL THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. BUT IS THAT [inaudible] GREAT. QUOTE COMES THIS IS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE BILL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ESSENTIALLY TAKE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE? OF FOR DECADES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. AND DOES MORE THAN JUST SAY THAT THE PARKS CONSOLIDATE AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IF STATE PARKS DETERMINES. THAT THEY CONSULT. BUT LIKE TO REMIND THIS COMMITTEE WE SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR LAST YEAR. THE ENTIRE YEAR GOING THROUGH THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT MET THE NEEDS OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS IT MET THE NEEDS OF LOCAL ENTITIES IT MET THE NEEDS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THE TESLA DISCUSSION WAS IN THE EARLY PART OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND IT WAS REJECTED. THAT IT NEEDED TO STAY WITHIN THAT HE'D AEGIS OF THE STATE PARKS. WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR IS THAT'S DIVISION WITHOUT THE FOLLOWING DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES? THE PLANNING ACQUISITION DEVELOPMENT CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF THE LANDS IN THE STATE VEHICULAR RECREATIONAL AREA. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS COMPLIANCE. CALIFORNIAN FIRE MENTAL QUALITY ACTS. WHAT WE HAVE HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? HERE'S A SITUATION IN WHICH THE STATE PARKS AND WHAT WE LEARNED LAST YEARS THAT THERE ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST AND MORE CULTURAL SCIENTISTS. ASSOCIATED WITH THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION PROGRAM THAN ANY OTHER PART OF PARKS ANY OTHER PART OF PARKS. AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE SOLD. BUT WE JUST PUT ASIDE THE NOTES FOR JUST A SECOND JUST SAY THIS. OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PARTS. THE PARKS PROGRAM. AND TOO OFTEN THIS BREAKS DOWN AND REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. WELL WE HAVE FOUND OUT IS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE RIDING JUST AS MUCH AS REPUBLICANS. IT IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT A RICH WHITE DAMMIT REPUBLICAN PROGRAM. DOES THE PROGRAM WORK. THE PROGRAM WORKS IT STRAORDINARIO EARLY WELL REMEMBER THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STATE PARKS IN CALIFORNIA. ONLY EIGHT OF THEM. OR OFF AYE WAY VEHICLE RECREATION. ONLY EIGHT OF THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY OR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. AND I WOULD ASK THIS QUESTION BEFORE I CLOSE. ANY STATE. I THINK A BETTER IDEA BEEN THE GLAZER BILL IN WHICH WE IGNORE. ALL OF THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THE OHP PROGRAM INTO TESLIN PARTICULAR. THAT INSTEAD OF AUTHORIZING ANYONE. STEAL THIS PARK CAN GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO A HEARING. ON TESLA ITSELF. BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO DISCOVER. THAT WHEN THIS PARK WAS SET ASIDE IN. NINETEEN BUT THEY WENT TO THE LOCAL ENTITIES. AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING IT PUBLICLY NOW SIGNED OFF. ON THIS PARK AND NOW WE'RE DOING NOT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS. BEYOND THE FACT. STEALING THE PARK. OR TRYING TO STEAL THE PARK OR SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF STEALING THE PARK WHEREVER WE WANT TO SAY. SENATOR GLAZER MENTIONED THAT THE OHP PROGRAM WILL GET MONEY BACK. WITH THE SAIL OF THIS PARK IS PART OF THE PARK. PERHAPS THAT'S THE MOST INSULTING PART OF THIS ENTIRE BILL. I CAN NOT THINK OF ANYWAY. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE MORE DISRESPECTFUL TO AN OHP PROGRAM. THAT HAS DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THE RULES. THEN TO SAY THAT THE PARK ITSELF CAN BE SOLD FOR LESS. THEN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE. WES THEN THE SPARE MARKET VALUE IN A REAL ESTATE MARKET THAT IS BOOMING IN AN AREA OF THE STATE IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. THAT WE WANT TO INSULT THE PROGRAM AND SAY LET'S SELL. AT LESS THAN MARKET VALUE NO THIS IS A BAD BILL AND I WOULD ASK DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO BOTH REJECT IT LET'S DO A HEARING ON THIS PARK. LET'S GET TO THE TRUTH OF THE PARK LET'S NOT TURN THIS PARK OVER TO PEOPLE. SOLD WHO ARE WILLING TO SIGN OFF ON IT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ACTING CHAIRMAN. I AM DIOMEDE I'M A CONSTITUENT OF SENATOR GLAZER. THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. I AM ALSO PAST PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA OFF ROAD VEHICLE ASSOCIATION. AN OFF ROAD VEHICLE ENTHUSIAST. A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. A MOTHER A GRANDMOTHER A DEFENDER OF ACCESS [inaudible] MOST IMPORTANTLY. I AM HERE IS A STAKEHOLDER FOR THE EXPANSION OF CARNEGIE STATE VEHICLE RECREATION AREA. IT'S INCUMBENT ON EACH OF US TO PRIORITIZE ISSUES AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY WHERE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS THE LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO MITIGATE LEGAL ACTIONS. AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR EXPANDING CARNEGIE S. B. ARE A I REPEAT. S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN WAS INTRODUCED. IS IN PROCESS. AND MAY SET PRECEDENT. STOP THE USE OF H. VIS ON A PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH OHP FUNDS WHOSE STATED PURPOSE WAS TO EXPAND AN EXISTING OHB FACILITY. A SINGLE FACILITY OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PLUS STATE PARKS IS ADDRESSED. IN THIS BILL. OUR STATE PARKS ARE HELD THE TO A HIGH STANDARD. THE H. M. V. R. DIVISION IS HELD TO AN EVEN HIGHER STANDARD. ESPECIALLY AFTER SB TWO FORTY NINE THE BIPARTISAN BILL. WHICH MISTER MIKHAIL HAS ALREADY REFERRED. TO WAS SIGNED INTO LAW LAST FALL. THANK YOU TO THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK ON THAT AGREEMENT. THAT BILL GRANTED THE CITIZENS pOF CALIFORNIA A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SUSTAINABLE OHB PROGRAM. STATE PARKS MISSION IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE HEALTH INSPIRATION AN EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BY HELPING TO PRESERVE THE STATE'S. EXTRAORDINARY BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY PROTECTING ITS MOST VALUE. NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH QUALITY OUTDOOR RECREATION. STATE PARKS HAS DEMONSTRATED. THAT THEY CAN DELIVER ON THEIR MISSION. AND PROVIDE FOR HIGHWAY MOTORIZED OFF HIGHWAY MOTORIZED RECREATION. DP ARE HAS THE CREDIBILITY THE ABILITY. AND THE COMMITMENT TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE EXPANSION PROPERTY BY PRIOR TENANTS. DAMAGE DONE BY PRIOR TENANTS. FULFILL ITS MISSION AND GIVE US THE OHP OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE LEARNED. APPROVAL OF THE GENERAL PLAN. HAS BEEN A YEARS ALONG INVESTMENT. WITH PUBLIC INPUT FOR EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS. S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD NOT ONLY ENABLE THE SALE OF THIS PROPERTY IT WOULD PERMIT A SALE. PRICE BELOW MARKET VALUE. TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD DO EVERYTHING STATE PARKS WOULD DO. BUT WOULD ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF OHP. HOW IS THIS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE? I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME TODAY PACKETS THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. IN YOUR PACKET YOU WILL FIND PHOTOGRAPHS OF CARNEGIE S. B. ARE A THE EXPANSION AREA AND HOLLISTER HILLS AS WE ARE A POOR STATE PARKS IS ESTABLISH THE KIND OF PARK THE EXPANSION COULD OFFER US. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A COPY OF A LETTER DRAFTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ACKNOWLEDGING THE PURCHASE PURPOSE OF THE TEST THE PROPERTY BY ADJACENT LANDOWNERS. S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN IS AN END RUN AROUND THE PROCESS. USING LEGISLATION TO SUPERSEDE THE WILL OF CITIZENS AND TAXPAYERS. IT FURTHER UNDERMINES THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS TO CARRY OUT THEIR MANDATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE CAPPING LIGHTS REPRESENTING A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE POLITICIAN IN OPPOSITION.

REGARD ALL THIS DISCUSSION WELCOME TO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE THAT BUT THIS PFIZER HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR VERY VERY LONG TIME -- WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BY ALL SIDES. ON THIS ISSUE AND IT'S IT'S WHY THIS BILL REALLY IS HERE TO PROVIDE AN OPTION THAT DOESN'T EXIST TODAY -- BUT THAT SO. BUT DOCTOR CHOI THE THIS IS THE EXISTING OFFER. VEHICLE. PARKED IN MY DISTRICT OKAY [inaudible] THE PICTURE -- IT IS MATCHING THERE'S EIGHT OF THESE IN THE STATE YES ONE OF THEM'S RIGHT HERE AND IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY AND AND HERE'S THE HILLS OF LIVERMORE -- WITH THE CURRENT -- CARNEGIE PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE SO. LOT IMPACTS LOT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BUT CERTAINLY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT GET TAKE GO TO OFF HIGHWAY. PARK THAT SIT NEARBY WHICH IS NICE -- TO AND HERE IS THE ADJACENT LAND. NEXT TO IT -- AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IT KINDA LOOKS THE SAME. EXCEPT FOR IT DOESN'T. AND AND THE VIEW IS THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE. FIVE ADJACENCY ISSUE HERE THAT WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND JUST ADD SOME MORE HILLS AND AND LET THOSE FOLKS HAVE A LITTLE BIT GREATER SPACE IN WHICH DIRECTORY. OBVIOUSLY TESTIMONY TODAY IT'S BEEN ABOUT THAT -- UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS AREA THIS THIS AREA THAT THAT'S IT THE EXPANSION AREA. AND WHY THEY'RE SET A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT DEGRADATION THAT WOULD RESULT -- IN THAT ACQUISITION AND THAT COMBINATION AND THIS IS NOW THE DISPUTE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. I AND MY DISTRICT. OUT WELL INTENTIONED BY PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THIS ACTIVITY IN THOSE WHO'D LIKE TO PRESERVE IT. JUST TO CLARIFY REAL QUICK SENATOR.

AND UP BEFORE AND AFTER -- THEN WILL YOU LIKEN THIS IS A LOT MORE YOU SEEN THERE IS THAT THAT THAT THAT I I THINK I UNDERSTAND I SEE I THINK I SEE THE PICTURE LET ME EXPLAIN IT -- THOSE WHO WERE AT CURRENTLY RUNNING THE CARNEGIE PROPERTY OF REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE NOT MANAGED IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE WAY. AND THEY ARE TRYING TO THEY TAKEN A SMALL SECTION I'VE GONE OUT THERE PERSONALLY TO SEE THIS THEY TAKEN IT SMALL AREA OF THE PROPERTY IN SAID IT WE CAN REDIRECT THAT ACTIVITY. YEAH YEAH ON TRAILS MAYBE WE CAN STOP THE MASSIVE DEGRADATION THAT'S OCCURRED OVER MANY DECADES AND SO THEY ARE. TRYING OUT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PARK AN EFFORT TO TRY TO STOP THAT WIDESPREAD DEGRADATION WHICH DOES EXIST TODAY. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE EFFORTS THAT THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO AYE. AYE DIRECTED AYE AS BEST THEY CAN TO SEE IF THEY CAN MINIMIZE SOME OF THAT MASSIVE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THAT EXISTING PARCEL AND AYE AYE AYE. I PRAISE THEM FOR THAT AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AT THE STEWARDSHIP HAS NOT BEEN GOOD AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BEFORE AND AFTER OF A PART OF PORTION OF THE CARNEGIE PROPERTY. OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AFTER CHOI. RIGHT. YEAH AND I JUST SAY IS JUST AS A MATTER OF A CONTEXT THAT YOU HAVE DRIVEN THROUGH THE AREA MANY TIMES. THERE'S ALSO THE SUMMER VERSES THE MORE SPRING TIME RIGHT IN THE SUMMER EVERYTHING LOOKS DEAD YOU KNOW [inaudible] BUT LOOKS VERY LUSH YOU KNOW IN THIS IN THE SPRING WRITING ALSO RIGHT. SO I KNOW THERE'S THOSE DIFFERENT TIMES AND IT'S BUT I'D REVENUE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES SAID. SO REMEMBER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. AS I'VE INTERACTED WITH FOLKS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ONE THING THAT SEVEN VERY CLEAR TO ME IS THAT -- OFFER A OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARE VERY POPULAR AMONG CALIFORNIANS -- THEY'RE POPULAR AMONG TOURISTS THAT ARE VISITING CALIFORNIA. I AND THE TREMENDOUS USE THAT WE SEE -- WITH OUR A STATE VEHICLE RECREATION AREA SHOWS ME. I THAT THERE IS INDEED NOT ENOUGH SPACE NOT TOO MUCH SPACE IN OUR STATE PARKS. I YOU KNOW I'M SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS IN THE NATIONAL PARKS BEING ABLE TO SKI. AND YEAH. YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE A SKI RUNS THAT ARE -- CARVED INTO. A MOUNTAINOUS AREAS UNDERSTATEMENT LIKE TAHOE IN THE SIERRAS AND DOWN NINE THE SAMPRADAYA MOUNTAINS WHERE I LIVE. UP BUT THAT'S A PART OF THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOOD OPEN SPACE I IS THAT -- PEOPLE [inaudible] CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE WHO VISIT CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO TO ENJOY THAT THE SPLENDOUR OF OUR OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE -- AND SO THAT'S WHY I'LL BE VOTING IN OPPOSITION THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE NEED MORE THIS SPACE NOT LESS. I THINK -- SO MEMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU SIR OF COURSE FOR THE AUTHOR AND OF THE THIRTY ONE HUNDRED ACRES THAT WERE ACQUIRED ARE YOUR BILL COMES OFF THIRTY ONE HUNDRED ACRES POTENTIAL SALE. IT DOES IT AS AN OPTION ONLY BUT YES I'M IN AND JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I HEARD THE COMMENTS ABOUT. FAR BELOW MARKET BUT THAT'S ONLY IN THE SITUATION WHERE THAT THE LAND REMAIN PUBLIC INFORMED -- PARK USES CRACK. BUT THERE THERE IS EXISTING LAW ON THEY A DISPOSITION OF LAND. AND IT PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WOULD DETERMINE. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE. JUST AS IT DOES WITH THE SALE OF ANY PROPERTY. DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WOULD FOLLOW THEIR STANDARD PROCEDURE WHICH PRESUMABLY INCLUDES CREEK OBTAINING A CURRENT APPRAISAL -- THE ASSERTION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BELOW THIS AND THAT BELOW MARKET THIS AND THAT. EYES JUST DAY A SPECULATION ON THEIR PART -- OBVIOUSLY -- MONEY WAS SET ASIDE PICKED OVER NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE THE LAND MANY. MANY YEARS AGO WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS. YEAH ONE CAN COME TO ANY CONCLUSION THEY WISH ABOUT THE VALUE IT MIGHT PROVIDE A UPON A SALE BUT ONCE AGAIN. THE DECISION TO SELL IS IT REMAINS IN AND THEY AYE AYE AND TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKING RACK AND THE OFF HIGHWAY. VEHICLE CONDITION WHO ARE THERE TO PROMOTE THE SPORT. IT REMAINS IN THEIR IN THEIR JURISDICTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD EVEN CONTEMPLATE A SALE. I UNDERSTAND IT THE SIMPLY AS I THINK YOU SAID EARLIER ADDING ADDITIONAL OPTION OR A PUTTING A ANOTHER OPTION ON THE TABLE BUT AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR IF I VOTE FOR THIS TODAY WHAT I'M. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF IT TO THE IF IT IS EVER SOLD FOR LESS THAN FAIR MARKET THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE RETAINED AS OPEN SPACE BY ANOTHER PUBLIC AGENCY? I WOULD BE BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WOULD AS THEY DID WITH ALL. OUR STATE PROPERTY MAKE AN ASSESSMENT ABOUT -- WITH WHAT THE SALE WOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE -- ARE THIS BILL A A THAT REQUIRES THAT IF THERE IS A SALE IT WOULD BE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES ONLY. THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY AT RA ALLOWED USE IF THERE WAS A SALE TO TAKE PLACE. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS THAT IN A NEIGHBORING I'D -- BUT FIND THAT IS INDICATED THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE MONEY SET ASIDE IT THAT'S THIS DOES BECOME AVAILABLE FOR SALE THEY'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN PURCHASING IT SO THERE'S A IT'S ACTUALLY WILLING BUYER ON THE SIDELINES NOW. ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKING RACK AND THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE COMMISSION DECIDE WHAT THEY THINK IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST YOU CAN. SIT IN COURT AND LITIGATE THIS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AS IT HAS BEEN. OR YOU CAN DECIDE THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER OPTION AT THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT MISTER CHAIR POINT INFORMATION YET THE ON AND SOME ARE NOT YOU -- PROPERTY -- PAGE TWO LINES NINETEEN TWENTIES SPECIFY IN THE BILL -- MAY TRANSFER THE LAND TO LOCAL AGENCY OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOR LESS THAN FAIR MARKET -- WAS NOT PUBLIC AGENCY AND THE YEAH. BUT RIGHT WILL KNOW THAT THE BILL SAYS WHAT IT SAYS DOWN. BUT I THINK YOU'RE. RIGHT. I THINK THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. IS IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF THIRTY ONE HUNDRED ACRES FOR RESIDENTIAL COME COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION. AND THAT DOES HAVE A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND LET'S LET LEAD TO MISSED WELL BUT YOU GLORIFIED NURSES ARE GOING PROFIT ORGANIZATION I MEAN I HAVE PLENTY OF NONPROFIT CONSERVANCY THAT OPERATE PUBLIC LANDS AND IN MY DISTRICT I MEAN THAT'S IF YOU HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE OVERALL. A NATURE OF WHAT NONPROFIT IMAGE HARPER WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU'RE CHOOSING TO TAKE MY TIME TO TO CASTIGATE ME OVER A BILL THAT'S NOT MINE BUT I'M SIMPLY TRYING INQUIRE ABOUT INFORMATION SO PLEASE. KEEP YOUR COLLEAGUE THAT COURTESY WHEN I'M SO TO CREATE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY YOU MENTION A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT IS FUNDED. THAT IS DOING WORK ADJACENT ALREADY YES WHAT KIND OF WORK THEY DO IN THAT CASE ACTUALLY OF A FUND THAT WAS CREATED THAT WITH THE CITING OF A LANDFILL. WHERE -- PEOPLE AGREED SAID THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEES WOULD GO INTO THIS FUND FOR LAND PRESERVATION OF THE AREA SO. THIS SITE LANDFILL AND CITY -- HAS BEEN -- HAS QUITE A BANK ACCOUNT NOW THAT IF THEY SO CHOOSE COULD BUY THIS LAND THAT'S VERY NEAR THERE. ERA AND THAT'S IN THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR OF WHAT'S BEEN REQUIRED. TO TO LET THE TO PRESERVE LAND MISS CHAIR I KNOW HE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME SAYS MISTER HARPER -- BUT I I WOULD WOULD JUST KNOW FROM YOU MISTER GLAZER THIS IS NOT YOU DOING THE SOLO -- THERE WAS NUMBER SPEAKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE SUPPORTED THIS -- ADDITIONAL YOU HAVE CO AUTHORS OF SENATOR GALGIANI HILL BY KOWSKI WIENER ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BERMAN BONTA CHIU GRAYSON LIVING AND TING I POINT THAT OUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A DISTRICT BILL. AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND FOR PROPERTY I'VE NOT BEEN TO BEFORE THE COMPLEXITIES ARE HERE BUT WHAT I AM PICKING UP IS THAT THERE'S BEEN. A LOT A WHOLE LOT NOTHING DONE FOR QUITE A USED ON THE PERHAPS THIS COULD SHAKE LOOSE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED ON THE SITE RATHER THAN THE ONGOING CONTROVERSY THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON HERE IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT MISS YOU THAT THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT -- IS THAT. OVERLAPS THIS PROPERTY IS ASSEMBLY WOMAN CATHARINE BAKER AND SHE IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS IS DISTINCTLY A DISTRICT ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE STAYED ON THE SIDELINES AND WATCH THE FIGHT GO ON FOR YEARS. AND IT'S OUR OF MUTUAL EFFORT WITHOUT TAKING SIDES ON IT FOR ANY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. JUST CREATE AN OPTION THAT IF THE POWERS THAT BE DECIDED THAT THIS LITIGATION IS GOING NOWHERE AND WE LOVE TO USE THAT MONEY TO ACQUIRE. OFF HIGHWAY SPACE ELSEWHERE THEY WOULD HAVE A TOOL IN WHICH TO ENGAGE IN THAT. THE NETWORK LIVE THE BILL'S CHIN. AND THERE IS A MOTION. ON HIS SECOND A BIAS IN THE RIVER LEVINE. YES SUMMER MATHIS THANK YOU. TOM FOR FIRST I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF RUNNING DISTRICT BILL CHATTER UNDISTURBED BILLS -- QUITE OFTEN MYSELF -- TO WITH THE PICTURES A ENDING THERE'S SOME GREAT POINTS THAT IS FIRE SEASONAL IN IN YEAH WE CAN SAY A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS BUT THAT THE REALITY IS IS IT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT WHEN THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN AND ALL OF THAT -- YOU KNOW. THEY ARE. OHB GUYS ARE OFF ROADERS ARE OUR GREAT STEWARDS OF THE LAND. NOW FOR ME IT'S VERY TRAGIC THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR AS I SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS -- I'VE SEEN THE STATE I'VE SEEN MEMBERS TRY TO TAKE AWAY LAND USE FOR OUR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES IN. IT'S VERY DISCOURAGING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF THAT SPACE AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW I CONSIDER NOT TO LOOK AT THESE PICTURES I CAN YOU KNOW AS AS AN AGRICULTURE GUY CAN GO. NO THAT'S THAT'S GREAT SPACE FOR FOR CATTLE GRAZING DO OTHER THINGS AS WELL. BLIGHT. I'M NOT SITTING HERE ADVOCATING THAT WE SELL THAT PROPERTY THE YOU KNOW THE CATTLEMEN'S. WE NEED TO KEEP THE SPACE THERE IT'S THERE FOR A REASON AND IT'S THERE FOR PEOPLE DIRECTORY. I CAN UNDERSTAND GROUPS WANTING TO SAY HEY LOOK WE CAN. YES SELL IT TO US WILL CLEAN UP WILL DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT. THAT THAT'S NICE BOY. SPACE EXISTS AS AN OFF ROAD SPACE. FOR PEOPLE OF RECREATION WE ONLY HAVE VERY FEW OF THOSE SPACES LEFT IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO HOLD ON TO THOSE. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IN AND I'LL TELL YOU HAVE BEEN A GUY FROM A RURAL DISTRICT. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE THAT SPACE? THEN YOU HAVE TRESPASSING ISSUES THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE TAKING THEIR OFFER OF VEHICLES ROF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARIANNA COLUMN. ON TO OTHER PEOPLE'S LANDS A STRONG AGRICULTURAL CROPS. STRAINED RANGE LANDS AND OTHER THINGS IS IMPORTANT. TO THE COMMERCE IN IN. TO ENSURE THAT THERE SOMEWHERE FOR THESE PEOPLE TO GO SEE THE SAME REASON WHY WE STARTED BUILDING SKATEPARKS IN THE NINETIES. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS TIRED EVERYTHING AND TORE UP SO LEGAL SKATEPARKS WE HAVE OFF ROAD VEHICLE PARKS FOR THE SAME REASON. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPENING ON PRIVATE LANDS. THAT ARE OWNED THAT ARE USED FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR ANYTHING ELSE. WE WE HAVE THESE PARKS THERE TO PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE. FOR OFF ROADERS TO GOV RECREATION. AND I'M SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT TAKING THAT AWAY FROM THEM. MISTER CHAIRMAN CANCER JUST A QUEST WAS UNDERNEATH OF THE YES OF MISTER MCKAY I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST. REBUT ANY THINGS THAT HAD COME UP DURING THE DISCUSSIONS HOUR HOLTER REAL QUICK IN TERMS OF THE USE OF THE LAND. IT IS INACCURATE TO SUGGEST. BED SUDDENLY BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDER PRESSURE. THE OFF HIGHWAY ROAD DIVISION DECIDED TO MITIGATE A CERTAIN PROPERTY IN ORDER TO APPEASE THIS LEGISLATURE OR ANYONE ELSE. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS RUN LAST YEAR. IT IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. THEY HAVE TO MITIGATE THE SLANT SOLDIERS PASSED THESE PICTURES AROUND TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THEM. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. IF THEY DO NOT MITIGATE THEN IT IS CLOSED. IT IS CLOSED. AND ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD LAST YEAR WAS THE IDEA TO WOULD MITIGATE IT AND CLOSE IT FOREVER WHICH OF COURSE MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE I'M A VERY SHORT TIME. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THESE PARKS ANYMORE BUT THE MITIGATION IS NOT DISCRETIONARY THEY HAVE TO MITIGATE IT THEY DO IT AN EXTRAORDINARY PART OF THEIR EXPENSES DOWN ON THAT. THE SECOND THING. PROBABLY THE MOST DISTURBING THING I'VE HEARD TODAY. IS THAT SENATOR GLAZERS SUGGESTION. THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPTION AND NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT [inaudible] AND YET. IF LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES HE WOULD ALREADY SELL THE LAND TO SOMEBODY WHO'S IN LINE TO BUY IT. THE LAND CAN BE PURCHASED BY A NONPUBLIC ENTITY FETCHED THAT'S TRUE. IT WILL BE OPEN LAND AND THAT IS OF VALUE TO SOME FOLKS. BUT THE TRUTH IS IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR ANY OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION FOR WHICH IT WAS INITIALLY INTENDED. MY SUGGESTION AGAIN IS THAT WE DO A HEARING ON THIS. AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL ALONE. IS INACCURATE IT IS A STATE PARK ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT NOW TO DECIDE HOW STATE PROPERTIES ARE GOING TO BE USED. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS SOMEONE MUCH SMARTER THAN E WHO HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. HAS MADE A SUGGESTION THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE. TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER IN A HEARING IN A DISCUSSION AND TALK THAT PERHAPS THERE'S MULTI USE THAT CAN BE DONE ON THIS PROPERTY. LET'S START FINDING RESOLUTION LET'S STOP THE IDEA OF THE FIGHTING BUT LET'S DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS NOT PUNITIVE TO THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE DIVISION ONLY EIGHT PARKS FOLKS ONLY EIGHT PARKS. AND IF YOU ALLOW EACH SENATOR EACH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SELL STATE PROPERTY. BEFORE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA SIDE THAT SHERIFF'S INTO A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN FIRST. THE YOU KNOW FOR GONNA LOSE THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE THESE DISTINCTIONS IN THE BEGINNING. I THANK YOU MR MCHALE -- AND NOT SEE ANY OTHER -- COMMENTS -- I WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW IT IS THE SECOND YEAR THAT I KNOW WE'VE HAD THE SAME ISSUE MAYBE A DIFFERENT BILL THAT SAME ISSUE -- IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE VERY STRONG. YOU KNOW STRONGLY HELD VIEWS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY WERE. YOU KNOW MOST OF US DON'T LIVE IN THAT DISTRICT RIGHT DOWN AND YOU ARE ARE KIND OF BEING ASKED TO MAYBE. ASCERTAIN OR MAKE A DECISION THAT'S YOU KNOW. SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN THAT AREA VERY -- PASSIONATE ABOUT RIGHT AND SO THAT DOES MAKE KIND OF TOUGH MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A HEARING IN THE FUTURE MIGHT HELP PROVIDE SOME MORE. CLARITY AND AND PROVIDE A LOT MORE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS ASSOCIATE HERE ONE THING I WOULD JUST SAY AS SENATORS. BECAUSE IT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT. YOU WANT TO GIVE THIS OPTION -- AT NIGHT I THINK I HEARD THAT PRETTY CLEARLY FROM YOUR FROM YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT I THINK THE CONCERN FROM THE O. H. V. SIDE IS WHAT THIS IS SOLD FOR LESS THAN FAIR MARKET VALUE WE DON'T RECOUP. THE MONEY TO OH HV WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING NO WAY TO BE IS TO PROVIDE THE SPACES AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. AND THIS PLACE FOR THE OFF A YOU OFF OFF ROAD VEHICLES -- THEN WE CAN'T REALLY GET THAT REPLACEMENT OR FIND SOME OTHER AREAS SO WHY NOT JUST TAKE OUT OF THEIR THAT LANGUAGES YOU COULD SELL IT FOR LESS -- THEM FAIR MARKET VALUE. AB WELL AND I WOULD SAY THAT WERE FOLLOWING CURRENT STATE LAW. AND I THINK YOU MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT I THINK IS A FAULTY ONE THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THIS CHOICE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT. I YOU LIKENED -- OTHERS AT THIS PANEL LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE TO BE -- HIV IS THAT IS THAT THE KEY TO THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE COMMISSION THAT THEY'RE THERE TO SUPPORT THE SPORTS. AND THEY'RE DIRECTLY ON THE FRONT LAWN OF THESE CHOICES OF WHAT. TO DAG WHAT THEY DO TOMORROW. AND THAT IT THAT IT DID NOT TRUST THEIR JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OFF ROAD I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE VALUE THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN THEY WERE GONNA TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CHOICE THAT THEY MAKE RIGHT IF YOU'RE ON THAT COMMISSION. USAGI WE COULD SELL IT BUT WE CAN ONLY GET ACTS WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD HOLD ON TO IT AND CONTINUE THE LITIGATION AND THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT TO FIGHT THIS THING. FOR THE YEARS PASSED IN THE YEARS IN THE FUTURE THEY COULD MAKE THAT CHOICE. BUT IT'S THEIR CHOICE TO MAKE. AND I'M SAYING THAT IF YOU LOVE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE. ACTIVITY THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS THEIR IT. THAT. A CASE CAN BE MADE. THAT HEY MAN GOOD WE WOULD WE WANTED TO EXPAND ITS NOT WORK AND WE'RE IN LITIGATION FOR EVER LET'SFIND A BETTER USE OF THAT MONEY LET'S GET THAT ACTIVITY AT A PLACE THAT. CAN BE WELCOMED AND EMBRACED AND AND CREATED. AND RATHER THAN BEING IN THIS QUAGMIRE IN THE MUD WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER AND I'VE GOTTEN IN THIS SPACE IS THAT. THEY'VE BEEN THE MUD WRESTLING FOR A LONG TIME AND NOTHING'S COME OUT OF IT AND SHE'S NOT OP AGAINST OFF ROAD USE SONORA LIFE IT'S DONE AND MANAGE CORRECTLY BUT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE OPTION IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING NOWHERE THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL THAT DISTRACTING CHAIR IN. A FAIR POINT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION -- YEAH I THINK THAT THEY ARE THERE. YA YOU WILL BE WILL WHO'S ON THAT WHAT WHO SERVES ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S ARE IT'S A GOVERNMENT APPOINTED BOARD COULD CHANGE OVER TIME. AND THEN I THINK THE BIGGER THE BIGGER POINT MADE BY SOME OR HARPER IS WE ARE THIS IS PUBLIC LAND I MEAN CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GONNA GET AT LEAST FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR EVER GOING. TO SELL PUBLIC PROPERTY YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS BUT I KNOW WE'VE. IT'S PROBABLY GOOD I THINK WE'VE NAILED ALL THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL TODAY SO -- WITH THAT I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND -- BY AS A MEMBER LEVINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- I THINK UNDER THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION I KNOW THERE'S PASSIONS ON ALL SIDES AS I SAY WELCOME TO MY DISTRICT. AND THAT I REALLY WASN'T TRYING TO TAKE A SIDE I KNOW THERE'S AN ASSERTION HERE. I WHICH I THINK IS THAT NOT PROPERLY MADE I I WANT TO GIVE THE DECISION MAKERS WHICH ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THIS RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY SOME CHOICES AND OPTIONS. I CERTAINLY GOVERNOR* I THINK WE PUT GOOD APPOINTEES ON THEIR END. OF THE GIVEN TO WORRY ABOUT -- BUT I I DO THINK THAT -- IT'S IT'S A WORD THE BILL IT'S A DISTRICT BILL BUT I'D ASK YOU TO CONSIDER IT FAVORABLY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I AGREE I THINK HE WOULD MAKE SOME GOOD APPOINTMENTS AND OKAY WITH THAT MADAM CLERK WOULD YOU PLEASE. IT IT THIS IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR -- TO THE ASSEMBLY ACCOUNTABILITY ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE. EDUARDO GARCIA. GALLAGHER NO GALLAGHER NO BIGELOW [inaudible] CARILLO.

NOW THAT IS A VERY LIKE BOARD SUBJECT AS YOU KNOW RIGHT -- SENATOR BILL PLEASE PROCEED YEAH THANK YOU -- MEMBERS -- THIS BILL -- S. B. -- THIRTEEN NO -- ONE IS A BILL THAT WOULD HELP EXPEDITE FLOOD. AND DAM SAFETY PROJECTS -- BY PERMITTING PROVIDING PERMIT APPLICANTS WITH A MECHANISM. FOR US UP SUPPLE. CONSTRUCTS WILL TUITION NOW OVER A YEAR AGO -- IN SAN JOSE -- WE HAD -- FOURTEEN THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT WERE DISPLACED BY THE KILEY CREEK FLOOD. IN A BECAUSE LE AS OF NOW WE DON'T KNOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT BUT SEVENTY THREE MILLION. AND DAMAGES DEVASTATED -- MANY PEOPLE'S HOMES. AND WE'VE HAD OTHER DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA OF THEN A PAINFULLY DEMONSTRATED. THE THREAT THAT THEY POSE TO HUMAN LIFE THE FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS -- INTENSE SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS CAN REDUCE. THE RISKS OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND SAVE LIVES. SO THIS BILL [inaudible] WILL PROVIDE PERMIT APPLICANTS TO APPLY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL CONSULTATION. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE EARLY ENGAGEMENT. WITH PERMIT AGENCIES. OF THROUGH THIS KIND OF CONSULTATION. AGENCIES CAN IDENTIFY ACTIONS TO HELP EXPEDITE THE REQUIRED PERMITS CLARIFY AND DISCUSS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MEDICATIONS. AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON PROMOTE DOCUMENTS. POTENTIALLY SAVE -- AND RESOLVE ANY CONFLICTS. THE PROJECT APPLICANTS WILL PAY FEES. COVER THE COST OF IT INTER AGENCY TEAM COMPRISED OF THE RELEVANT AGENCIES. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANY PROJECT WILL STILL BE SUBJECT. TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. I THOUGHT TODAY HAVE WITNESSES FROM THE SANTA CLARAVALLEY WATER DISTRICT -- WE'VE HAD NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. URGENT AYE VOTE ON IT AND ALL TURN OUT MY WITNESSES PLEASE OKAY WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RACHEL GETS AND THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER WITH THE SENECA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT WERE SPONSORING SB THIRTY NO ONE BECAUSE DELIVERING FLOOD PROTECTION. WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP PROJECTS IN A TIMELY FASHION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT THIS BILL SIX A SOLUTION THAT BOTH BOLSTER STATE PERMITTING AGENCIES WITH MORE RESOURCES. AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW AND PRINT PROCESS HE THREW ENHANCE CONSULTATION WITH STATE PERMITTING AGENCIES. I WHERE HERE WITH ME TODAY IS KURT LEUENBERGER FROM OUR WATERSHED STORAGE BIN PLENTY DIVISION TALK MORE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. WE FACE AND HOW S. B. THIRTY NO ONE WILL HELP DELIVER THESE FLOOD RISK REDUCTION AND DAM SAFETY PROJECTS FASTER WITHOUT COMPROMISING ON ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KURT LEUENBERGER AND A SENIOR WATER RESOURCE SPECIALIST WORKING FOR THE WATERSHED STEWARDSHIP AND PLANNING DIVISION. OF THE SENATOR VALLEY WATER DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY. A GETTING A MAJOR FLOOD RISK REDUCTION AGAIN SAFETY PROJECT THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT RUBIO PERMIT APPROVAL TAKES YEARS AND AT TIMELINE HAS GOTTEN LONGER AS THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT LOCATIONS HAVE INCREASED. STAFF RESOURCES IN STATE BERMAN AGENCIES HAVE NOT. THESE AGENCIES ARE OPERATING IN TRIAGE MODE. MEANING THEY ONLY HAVE THE FULL TIME TO FULLY ENGAGE ON THE PERMIT APPLICATION BEFORE THEN AND VERY LITTLE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE EARLY CONSULTATION PROJECT DESIGN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. UNFORTUNATELY THE LACK OF FULL ENGAGEMENT. BY STATE PERMITTING AGENCIES EARLY IN THE PROCESS IS A SIGNIFICANT TRIBUTE DELAYS ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT ISSUANCE. THE RESULT IS COSTLY PROJECT REDESIGNS UNPLANNED MITIGATION COSTS AND MOST CONCERNING SIGNIFICANT DELAY OF THE LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS SUCH AS FLOOD PROTECTION IN DAM SAFETY. S. B. THIRTEEN A ONE WILL HELP REMEDY THESE ISSUES PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL CONSULTATION WITH STATE AGENCIES EARLY IN THE DESIGN OF FLATTENED AND SAFETY PROJECTS AND STAY ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND PERMITTING PROCESS. THIS MECHANISM IS MODELED AFTER SIMILAR FRAMEWORK RECENTLY DEVELOPED SEVERAL FEDERAL ANDSTATE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REDUCE PERMITTING TIME FOR A MULTI BENEFIT RESTORATION PROJECTS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO BAY. EARLY ENGAGEMENT THROUGH SUBLIMINAL CONSULTATION WILL MAKE THE SECRET PROCESS BETTER BY GETTING IT SIGNIFICANT VIOLENT TAX IDENTIFIED BY STATE AGENCIES AND ANY PROPOSED LITIGATIONS INTO THE DRAFT THE I. R. FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW AND COMMENT. OUR GOAL IS MORE COLLABORATION ON THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF VITAL FLOOD RISK REDUCTION DANCE SAFETY PROJECTS MORE RESOURCES FOR STATE PERMITTING AGENCIES IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY THROUGH A SEQUEL. AND MORE COMPLETE PERMIT APPLICATIONS S. B. THIRTY NO ONE WILL DELIVER FLED INDIAN SAFETY PROJECT PERMITTING FASTER SMARTER WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT COMPROMISING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

WELL I THINK YOU -- FIRST OF ALL MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU PUT IN THE BILL -- AND YEAH THIS IS. IT'S IMPORTANT MEASURE WERE FACING HERE TODAY NOT OFTEN IN CALIFORNIA DO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPACT. THE ENTIRE WORLD -- WITH ONE STROKE OF A PEN BUT I I THINK THIS BILL COULD ACTUALLY BE WHAT TURNS THE TIDE IN THE FIGHT TO PRESERVE THE THE LAST REMAINING ICONIC ENDANGERED AFRICAN SPECIES S. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DOES THAT BY PROHIBITING THE POSSESSION OF BODY PARTS. ELEVEN ICONIC AVERAGE ENDANGERED SPECIES AND EARLIER THIS YEAR AS YOU KNOW WE LAWSUIT AND AYE THE LAST MALE NORTHERN WHITE RHINO. AND THE STRANGEST KEEP CONTINUING -- ELEPHANTS ARE DOWN 30% IN IN POPULATION OVER THE LAST -- SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN LINES ARE DOWN 43% FROM NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THE BLACK RHINO IS DOES DECLINE 97% SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY I THINK THE ESSENCE OF HIS BILL. IS THAT [inaudible] CONSERVATION STRATEGY NEED NOT ADOPT A POLICY. OF POACHING AND OF KILLING TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ITS ENDS. THAT WE DON'T NEED TO KILL TO CONSERVE AND THAT IN FACT -- THAT WHATEVER PROWESS -- SOME TOUGH GUY MAY FEEL BY PUTTING -- MOUNTING ON ABOVE HIS MANTEL UM. THE AN AFRICAN. I'LL A FENCE OR A BLACK RHINO -- THAT THAT THAT THAT CELEBRATION OF OF MASCULINITY IS -- IS DEAD IT'S IT'S OUTDATED AND THAT HAS TO AND AND THIS YEAR OF TROPHY HUNTING -- HAST AND AND I THINK IT STARTS WITH US SO -- I HAVE FOLKS YOU KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I HERE WITH ME TODAY SO WITH THAT I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- AND ALLOW -- WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST? IF YOU DON'T MIND OKAY SO NICK SACKETS WITH SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION WE ARE HONORED TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT STEP IN REDUCING UNNECESSARY AND UNSUSTAINABLE KILLING OF ELEPHANTS LIONS RHINOS AND OTHER SPECIES THAT ARE. UNDER -- THREAT DUE TO HABITAT LOSS POACHING AS WELL IS LAWFUL KILLING BY INTERNATIONAL TROPHY HUNTERS. WE CAN'T STOP THE DECLINE TO EXTINCTION OF THESE ANIMALS WITHOUT ADDRESSING EACH ASPECT DE UNITED STATES IS THE LARGEST IMPORTER OF WILDLIFE TROPHIES IN THE WORLD WITH HUNDREDS OF ELEPHANTS IN THOUSANDS OF LINES KILLED AN IMPORTED OVER THE PAST DECADE. SADLY MANY OF THESE ANIMALS ARE KILLED BY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND BROUGHT INTO THE STATE. WHILE HUNTERS REGULARLY CITE THE SUSTAINABLE NATURE OF THEIR TAKE AND THE SO CALLED CONSERVATION BENEFIT THAT FLOW FROM SUCH KILLING. NO STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THIS TO BE THE CASE. THROUGHOUT AFRICA THE PURPORTED ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF TROPHY HUNTING GO TO WEALTHY HUNTING OUTFITTERS AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS BUT THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT LESS THAN 3% OF TROPHY HUNTING REVENUES ACTUALLY ARE SHARED WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. A RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THESE ANIMALS MEANWHILE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM ECO TOURISM DWARF ALL THOSE FORMS OF DWARF OTHER FORMS OF REVENUE FOR THESE COUNTRIES WHILE NOT DECIMATING ENDANGERED SPECIES. TROPHY HUNTING RESULTS NOT JUST IN THE NEEDLESS DEATH OF INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS BUDDY CREATES IS A SCENARIO WHERE. A GOOD GENES ARE BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE GENE POOL ON THESE ANIMALS ARE GENETIC POOL OR DECLINING. A I ONE EVEN EXAMPLE A LINE UP POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED ALMOST THE TROPHY HUNTING. IN THE SAME PERIOD OVER TWENTY THOUSAND AFRICAN LINE PARTS WERE TRADED REPRESENTING OVER SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL ALLIANCE AND SHAMEFULLY. THE U. S. IMPORTER OVER HALF OF THESE FORM OF TROPHIES. SO DESPITE THE SHOCKING POPULATION DECLINE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVERSED THE MORATORIUM ON IMPORTING THESE IMPORTANT DANGER SPECIES MAKING WAY. FOR EVEN MORE RAPID DECLINE WE FACE WE ARE FACED WITH SOME PREEMPTION ROADBLOCKS AND THAT IS WHY I S. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS NARROWLY TAILORED. TO THREAD THE NEEDLE AND BE ABLE TO DO WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABLE TO DO WHICH IS BANNED THE POSSESSION AND STATE. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY I AFTER I BOW AND INTRODUCE A SAM JOE HOA. MY MY NAME IS SAM HALL. I'M RETIRED THE PRETTY RESIDENT AGENT CHARGE FOR THE SECOND LARGEST PORT IN THE COUNTRY AND HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

THE DEPUTIES WERE PLAYING THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE THE NORTH AMERICAN LIFE MODEL BASED UPON THE USE OF PACE SYSTEM. NOW IN PARTICULAR. LET ME SAY THAT THEM. HUNTING PROVIDES THREE THINGS AT A CRITICAL. THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE THREATS TO WILDLIFE. AND SOUTHERN ASIA AFRICA WHERE WHAT MOST WOULD STILL EXIST HABITAT LOSS THE FIRST THREAT. THE SECOND IS COACHING SPECIAL I PARTICULARLY VALUABLE ITEMS LIKE IVORY RHINO HORN THE SO FORTH. THIRD IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONSERVATION INFRASTRUCTURE JUST LIKE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO IN THE WORLD PAYS FOR THAT. SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS MORE HABITAT. THE HUNTING HABITAT THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL THESE THE GOOD FAITH PEOPLE. IN SOME COUNTRIES LIKE TANZANIA THE HUNTING AREAS A SIX TIMES LARGER. STUNT LARGER THAN THE NATIONAL PARKS THE SERENGETI GORE GO CRATER SO FORTH. TO THE OPPOSITE EN IN THE SOME BOB WAY OF MOZAMBIQUE IT'S THE HUNTING AREA TWICE THE SIZE OF THE NATIONAL PARKS.

CONFIDENT JOHN DINGELL INTRODUCED AND FOR THE IN A DANGER SPACE ACTING HAS BUT PROVISIONS. PERMITS ONLY GRANTED FOR THESE SPECIES -- IF THE HANDSOME IS PROVEN. I THINK YOU'RE A MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CAPITAL WINTER PRESENTING SPIKELET INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS MEANS COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY A NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION. I RESPECT YOUR TWO MINUTES AND BE BRIEF I JUST WANT TO COVER SOME REALLY BASIC THINGS ARE ABOUT THE BILL -- FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL WAS -- ONE OF THAT GOTTEN AMENDS AFTER THE SPOT BELT OUTLINED ON APRIL SECOND FOR THE RECORD. AND THIS BILL IS NOT GERMANE THIS WAS A PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE BILL WHICH DELTON TRANSPORTATION XIN GAME CODE -- THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE CALIFORNIA SOME LEGAL GAME HUNTING IN AFRICA -- I KNOW THE SUPPORTERS MENTIONED THEY HAD SOME BARRIERS WILL A FEW OF THOSE BARRIERS ARE THIS BILL IS CONTRARY TO THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR MANY SPECIES. THUS INVALIDATING IT AND PREEMPTED FRANKLY. ON THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY ENACTED SUCH A LOT OF HAVE TOSSED OUT IN THE COURTS AFTER NEW JERSEY REALIZED IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND IT ENTERED A CONSENT DECREE. CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CONTRARY TO FEDERAL LAW EXPOSING CALIFORNIA TOO EXPENSIVE LITIGATION AND IT WOULD LIKELY LOSE. THE BILL IGNORES THE CONSERVATION BENEFITS OF HUNTING AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- AND WE'RE NOT IN A BETTER POSITION TO JUDGE A SCIENCE OF THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE SOCIETIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE. THE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY HURT AFRICAN COMMUNITIES AND SOUND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. IT ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RESOURCES IN ANOTHER CONTINENT IN A HEARING WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPERTS. AND THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS FRANKLY FOR EXAMPLE THE REFERENCE TO BOTSWANA -- STOPPING HUNTING IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS THE SUCCESS OF IS MISLEADING AT BEST. THIS WAS DONE ON STATE AND COMMUNAL LANDS HUNTING WAS STILL ALLOWED ON PRIVATE LANDS ADDITIONALLY SINCE THAT TIME RESEARCH THAT'S APPROACHING IN HUMAN WILDLIFE CON. FLICKS HAVE INCREASED NOT DECREASED SINCE THE SUSPENSION AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE PETITIONING THE GOVERNMENT TO REOPEN HUNTING. THE LAS REFERENCE THAT ADDRESS WILDLIFE OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA OR FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. AND PERSONAL POSSESSION WHICH IS THIS BILL GOES WAY BEYOND THAT. FOR NON ASA SPECIES THERE'S NO SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THE BANNING OF IMPORTATION IN POSSESSION AND FOR THE LISTED SPECIES THE UNITED FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S HAS JURISDICTION OVER THOSE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON SCIENCE. THE PENALTIES ARE STAGGERING. AND ESTABLISH A BOUNTY HUNTING ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS A TAKING AND WILL DRAIN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FROM THE DUTY OF MANAGING OUR OWN RESOURCE. AND I WOULD JUST IMPLORE UN CLOSE TO THINK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS. YOU'RE SITTING IN JUDGMENT OF A LEGAL RECREATIONAL PURSUIT OF YOUR CITIZENRY. OUT OF THIS STATE AND YOU'RE TELLING THEM THAT THEY CAN LEGALLY BRING IT AND THEY CAN LEGALLY POSSESS IT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO COME GET YOU ONE DAY THIRTY AND MAKE YOU A CRIMINAL. AND I WERE CLOSE TO STANDARD STERN WHO LAST TIME I TESTIFIED CALLED HUNTERS POACHERS IN THIS TIME SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN DON'T COUNT THEY DO. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] PLEASE -- STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION WHICH RIGHT NOW IS I AM DANCERS HIM A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WILL SOAR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR. AND HAD TWO MINUTES A PIECE% RIGHT TO THINK EIGHT THE REASONS WHY THANK YOU. SEARCH YOUR BILL GAINES MEDINA ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION THE CONGRESSIONAL SPORTSMAN'S FOUNDATION THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE WILD SHEEP FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION AND SIX OTHER WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. YOU'RE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RIGHT GRIPPED SPEAK ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE PROPOSED THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN JIM WATER SUB MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE MISSOURI WILDLIFE IN THE MISSOURI -- SAFARI CLUB AND THAT'S MISSOURI SPELLED M. Z. YOU ARE I WHICH IS A SWAHILI WORD. VIRTUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. VOTE ON IT BECAUSE OF SCIENCE AND THE FACTS NOT A MOTION. DAN READ WITH NATIONAL RIGHTFUL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. SAMPRAS REPRESENT GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA. OVER THIRTY THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN. IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. MY NAME IS WHITE CHEN AND I ALSO OPPOSE THIS BILL. ROBERT DTS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE RIVER CONSERVATION CAMPING VISITOR AFRICA FIVE TIMES THAT'S REMOVED SNARES MANY TIMES I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER OPPOSITION WILL TO GET BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FOR ON THE BILL YES US A MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU -- I AM GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION SLASH CONCERN -- AS SOMEBODY WHO ALSO AS AN ANTIQUE DEALER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE. THESE ITEMS THAT ARE OLDER -- I'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE IVORY BAN WHICH I ALSO SUPPORT BUT QUITE HONESTLY WHEN IT COMES. TO VINTAGE JEWELRY DEALERS I'M JUST AN AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S TRYING TO MAYBE SELL A PIECE OF GEORGIA TO BE FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. IT'S REALLY BEEN -- A BAD SITUATION ON THE GROUND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF ITEMS BEING SEIZE FROM PEOPLE AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TYPE OF BONE OR IVORY IS IN. IN THIS AND I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN WITH THIS BILL DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT NO MATTER WHEN THESE ITEMS WORKERS. WERE PROCURED OR THEN THEY'RE ALL FAIR GAME WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON THAT THANK YOU ACTUALLY FOR THAT QUESTION SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH. A BOTH COMMITTEE STAFF HERE AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY IS BILLS DOUBLE REFERRED. SO -- THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN CONTEMPLATING IT NAY NAY CAN COMMENT ON THEM BUT THERE'S A PROCESS FOR DEMONSTRATING THE DATE OF POSSESSION. DESERTED DISTINGUISH BETWEEN -- ITEMS THAT ARE ALREADY HERE AND ITEMS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN. IT SHOULD THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AFTER THE BAND SO JUSTTO BE CLEAR SO YOU CAN STILL SELL AN ITEM IF IT'S AN OLDER ITEM OR NO OF THE WITH THIS BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH SELLING AT ALL SO IF IF IF THE SELLING OF THE ITEM IS LEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THEN YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO SELL IT KNOWLEDGE AGAIN. IF UNLESS NOW FEDERAL LAW DOESN'T -- PREEMPT POSSESSIONS SO WE'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T POSSESS IT NOW. IF THAT IT IT THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T SAY YOU CAN'T SELL IT BEN YOU BEND YOUR BILL TO SELL IT BUT THERE'S A GRANDFATHER DATES IF YOU'VE HAD THE THE ITEM ALREADY. AND FEDERALLAW SAYS YOU CAN SELL IT THEN YOU CAN SELL IT. BUT THE CAN YOU PURCHASE THAT AND AN ITEM THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD HIS LAST PREVIOUSLY BEFORE THE BAN. NO YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A CAN'T BE SOLD. TO ME THAT'S THAT'S AN ISSUE I MEAN SOME OF THESE ITEMS ARE QUITE OLD THEY WOULD FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF ANTIQUES. AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TRY TO ADD AN AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SALE. OF THOSE ITEMS THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME DIFFICULTY BUT YOU KNOW. I DO YOU REALLY WANT TO CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE GRANDMA'S SHAWL SHOWERS A LEOPARD SHAWL TO AND MAYBE YOU DO. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SUMMARIZE THAT POSITION. TO THIS BILL'S ENACTMENT SO SO THEY THAT AMENDMENT SAYS YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE POSSESSION OF THE ARTICLE FOR JENNIFER TWENTY NINETEEN BY FURNISHINGS AND DOCUMENTATION. SO BALLOT PERMITS A BILL OF LADING -- ABOUT APPRAISAL PHOTOGRAPHIC BUT AREN'T YOUR POINT ABOUT SALES. IT'S OUT OF OUR PURVIEW -- TO GET INTO SALES THE REASON THE BILL FOCUSES ON POSSESSION IS STRICTLY TO STAY WITH IT WITH WITHIN OUR LANE AND NOT BE PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW SO I TO WHAT THEN YOU CAN'T. PURCHASE ONE OF THESE OLDER ITEMS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE OWNED IT BEFORE. NO MATTER WHEN IT WAS PROCURED YOU WOULD NOT HAVE OWNED IT FOR A YEAR BASICALLY DE FACTO BANNING THE SALE OF ANY ANTIQUE ITEMS. SO DISRUPTING FREE TO THINK ABOUT MOVING OKAY FORWARD WITH IF. BECAUSE THEN EVEN IF SOMEBODY GOES TO AN ANTIQUE STORE A FLEA MARKET AND BUY SOMETHING THAT'S CLEARLY OLD. MAYBE IT'S A PIECE OF SOMETHING THAT'S AN OLD PIECE OF JEWELRY FOR INSTANCE WHICH WE SEE COMMONLY AND IN THIS BUSINESS. ON YOUR THAN SAYING THAT THAT ITEM THAT THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW TO POSSESS IT AT THAT POINT. I I WILL POINT OUT THAT ARE. UNDER SOCIETY'S APPENDIX ONE ALL THOSE SPECIES LISTED ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD UNDER THE ESA INSIDE HE'S. SO BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE COMMERCIAL SALES OF OF ENDANGERED SPECIES ON APPENDIX. ONE THANK YOU THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SIGN OR MATHIS. YES THEN YOU MUST HAVE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS TOM IN AND KIND OF FOR FOR BOTH SIDES -- WHAT ARE THE CONSERVATION BENEFITS THE? OF OF REGULATING HAUNTING UNDER YOUR BILL SENATOR AND ENOUGH I CAN GET. THE ANSWERS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO DISCOURAGE THAT -- ALSO HOW DOES THE BILL OBSTRUCT THE CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES UNDER FEDERAL. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT -- HOW IMPORTANT IS THE CONSERVATION OF HONEY INTO THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PROGRAMS AND I KNOW SOME OF THAT WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER -- IF YOU. FULLY ANSWER THAT -- WHAT THE FACT WITH THE BILL HAVE ON THE CAPACITY OF THESE RANGE STATES TO PROTECT THE SPECIES -- AND THEN WE'LL ONE BY. ONE YEAH ABSOLUTELY ARMY I GOT GREAT QUESTIONS FOR YOU OKAY LET'S START AT THE TOP CENTER YOU YOU KNOW I'VE TRAVELED INTERNATIONALLY AND I'VE SEEN SOME OF THESE THINGS SO YEAH SO GIMME GIMME GIMME THE FIRST ONE TO GET OUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE CONSERVATION BENEFITS. OF THE REGULATED HUNTING UNDER YOUR BILL AND WHAT OF THE AND TO DISCOURAGE SO THE GOAL THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS ENHANCE CONSERVATION AND AND THAT THE THESIS OF THE BILL IS THAT. HUNTING IS OF MUCH LESS SUSTAINABLE WAY TO PROMOTE CONSERVATION OF THESE AFRICAN ENDANGERED SPECIES THEN THROUGH OTHER. TECHNIQUES SO WE THINK MORE DOLLARS GET BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY TO DO THE KIND OF POPE -- POACHING ENFORCEMENT AND THE OTHER SORT OF IMPORTANT MEASURES THAT -- THAT THE OPPONENTS WERE DISCUSSING THROUGH SAFARIS ECO TOURISM WITHOUT AN ACTUAL HUNTING OBJECTIVE BUT THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO TO THAT COTTON AND ENJOY THESE ANIMALS THAT ACTUALLY. WILL BRING MORE REVENUE BACK THIS COMMUNITIES AND KEEP A YOU KNOW A FEW A FEW APPROACHES AND IF THAT WAS WAS THE CASE THAT ARE GOING TO THINK THE COUNTRIES WOULD BE PUSHING FOR THAT. WELL THE COUNTRIES ARE JUST HUNGRY FROM. I'D LIKE TO HEAR. THAT'S LIKE SAYING. WITHOUT WINGS A BIRD WILL FLY RIGHT WINGS IN THIS CASE OR THE LAW OF THE REVENUE FROM THE HUNTING. THE HABITAT FOR THE HONEY. THE OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. AND MAJOR NGOS NOT THE ONES THE SPONSORS WOULD MAKE NGOS AT W. W. OF THE LARGEST THAT THE WORLDWIDE WORLDWIDE OF OF FOUNDATION THE CONSERVATION ASIA I UCN. THE ARM OF ALL THE RANGE NATION'S THE SPECIALIST GROUPS. ALL ACTION PLANS ALL DEPENDING ON HONEY JUST LIKE A WHILE I'VE NOT AMERICA I MEAN IT'S IT'S A FACT. AND I WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT A HABITAT WHEN I TALK ABOUT A LARGE PART OF IT WOULD FALL DOWN MOST OF THE HABITAT MOST OF THE HALF APPROACHING REVENUE. THESE ARE FACTS THAT NOT DISPUTED FACTS I HAVE NO I'VE COMMITTED OF SENT BY FAX. A COPY OF THESE OF THE ALL THESE FACTS. TO EVERY COMMITTEE MEMBER. BUT THIRTY PAGES. WHILE REFERENCE AUTHORITY PAGES AND I'M ON A ARE YOU SEE AND I WANNA SLEEP DESPAIR WILL USE LIVE WITH A SPECIAL GROUP I'M ON AFRICA LINE WORKING GROUP I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND I PROMISE YOU THAT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS ALONG FOURTH OFFICES PAY PARA HUNTERS IN AFRICA. IT DOES NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE NO ALTERNATIVE IN THIS BILL CERTAINLY THAT PROVIDE. IT'S IT'S YOU SHOT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY THE BIRDS GOING TO FLY WITHOUT WINGS. BEST ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION. NO WE JUST WANT THE BIRDS TO ENABLE THE FLY NOT BE OFF YEAH YEAH. OF THE VOTE. OKAY I JUST WANNA WATCHES HAVE A LITTLE BIT AT A QUORUM SO SIR I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME IS ASKING QUESTIONS BEHIND YOU BUT DIRECTOR ANSWERS TO THE CHAIR OF OUTPUT ON THEM AND THAT IS HOW YOU DIRECTOR ANSWERS TO THE COMMITTEE. AND WE ALSO WANT TO STOP A BACK AND FORTH CONVERSATION I KNOW YOU GUYS. ARE ENJOYING THAT CONVERSATION I I THINK I'D ENJOY THAT CONVERSATION BUT THAT'S NOT THE PLACE RIGHT HERE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION SO IF. MR MATHIS HAS SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I DO MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. IF SOMEONE HAS IT PERTINENT ANSWER GO AHEAD AND ANSWER IT BUT LET'S TRY TO LIMIT SOME SIDEBAR. OR SOME QUIPS SO THAT WE CAN JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET AND VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT DON'T GET. MY APOLOGIES FOR EQUIPMENT BACK BY AT YES -- IN IN IN IN THE EARLIER COMMENTS. AND PLEASE DIRECTOR. YOUR REMARKS IN INTO THE MICROPHONE SO THEY'RE RECORDED -- HOW HOW DOES THE BILL OBSTRUCT THE CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT? AND AND SERVE YOU DIRECT INTO THE MICROPHONE. YEAH BUT THAT WAS TO THE YEAH UP A VOTE HARD LOOK THAT THE IN ENGINE SPECIES ACT. OUR HAS SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO USE HUNTING AS A TOOL FOR CONSERVATION. AND TODAY WAS LISTED SPECIES IS THE FOREMOST TO IT ALSO IMPLEMENT SITE THESE. SITE IS HAS BETTER RESOLUTIONS. ALLOWING QUOTAS FOR THE SPECIES FOR EXAMPLE BLACK RHINO -- FIVE EN THE OF THE BE HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS MONEY EXPENSE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND RONALD WAS STRAIGHT INTO THE CONSERVATION SPECIES ON ON ON ON ON ON ON IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY FROM INCEPTION [inaudible] JOHN DINGELL WAS THE AUTHOR AND A JUST PEACE ACT ALL THREE OF THEM. EXCUSE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IS PACIFIC WOULD PROVIDE FOR AND SECRETARY IN ISSUE PERMITS FOR IMPORTATION HUNTING TROPHIES WHEN ENHANCES SURVIVAL SPECIES FILL LABORATORY GRAHAM. THAT THE USERS LEVERAGE. THE SOUTHERN EAST AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT THEY CAN IMPORTANT TROPHIES ONLY IF THEY MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS. HIS SOME REAL BURDEN IT TAKES SOMETIMES YEARS TEN TWENTY YEARS TO IMPORT BUT THAT THE IT STEPS THOSE PROGRAMS UP IN AFRICA THERE THE FOREMOST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD AS REASON WHAT POPULATIONS OR A STABLE SECURE OR AND OR GROWING. AND SUDDENLY SAID AFRICA THE ONLY ONES BOTH THE LINE'S MOSTLY ELEPHANTS MOST A RHINO. A IF NOT ALL OF THEM ALMOST. AND THAT THE DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THAT IS THERE SUSTAINABLE USE BASE PROGRAM. OF THAT'S HOW IT AFFECTS THERE IS COMPOSED IN CONFLICT WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES. OKAY AND THEN FOLLOW UP ON THAT WELL HOW IMPORTANT IS THE CONSERVATION HUNTING TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE PROGRAMS WHERE IT WITH I MEAN I KNOW -- W. ASK CAMPFIRE LIFE PRESS PROJECT I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING IN CLOSE TO YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A MILLION FAMILIES IN SOME OF THESE CASES. IN THESE COUNTRIES SO IF YOU CAN EXPAND ON THAT SIR. FORGIVE MY BACK AGAIN ALL TAUGHT IN THE HOPE THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS [inaudible] PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THESE ARE RULE PEOPLE THEY ULTIMATELY WILL ULTIMATELY WOULD TERM IT WILL DETERMINE THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES. THAT ALSO IN THE SHORT TERM DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THESE BEACHES HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE OUTSIDE OF PROTECTED AREAS WHICH ARE. BUT NOT AS NUMEROUS AS THEIR HOMELANDS. MOST WILDLIFE IN SOUTHERN EASTERN AFRICA EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY AREAS. NOW OF THAT WITH ELABORATE PROGRAMS. SUPPORTED BY OFFICIAL WHILE OUR SERVICE. BY KAT US CONGRESS BY STUDIES BY WERE WHILE I PHONE AND OTHERS. THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN'T FIRE PROGRAM IS ABOUT WAY. HIS SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES MOSTLY CHILDREN. THEY EARN 70% OF THE REVENUE FROM TOURISTS FOR HUNTING. A MOST OF THESE ARE. SPEECH IS THAT IT WAS SPEAKING OUT HERE TODAY FACTO SPEECHES ARE SO IMPORTANT THE SYSTEM WOULD COLLAPSE. WITHOUT THE IMPORTER OF TROPHIES THE UNITED STATES. BUT ALSO THE SPECIES WOULD DISAPPEAR BECAUSE A SERVICE HAVE SHOWN THAT HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR LA HINTS AND ELEPHANTS IN THEIR BACKYARD. THAT THIS IS -- THAT THESE PROVISIONS ACTUALLY BENEFIT TO SPEECHES AND ALL GROWING THOSE POPULATIONS. THE SAME THING AS IN THE LIBYA THE MEDIA -- HAS A LIFE WERE WHILE I FUND HAS THAT WERE ALL OF LIFE PLUS PROGRAM THIRTY YEARS OLD. FOR NOW PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD DEPEND ON THIS -- THE HUNTING OF THE SPECIES IS GENERATING THE COR REVENUE -- THIS IS TRUE IN TANZANIA THROUGH US ALL OF SOUTHERN EAST AFRICA THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT DAY OR DEPENDENT ON HUNTING FOREVER IN TO THIS IS THIS IS A BLACK AND WHITE OPEN UNCLE UNCONTESTED. WHAT YOU'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT THE FACTS YOU HEARING ABOUT -- AT SOME -- THESE ARTIFACTS AND I YOU SEE UNDERSTAND BONTA WWF STAND BEHIND OF THE US GOVERNMENT FISH WHILE OUR SERVICE STANDS BEHIND IT. ENFORCEMENT OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT INSIGHT IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THEY SHOULD STAND BEHIND IT -- ARE I WILL I WAS THE CHAIRMAN THE CITY CHAIR I SHOW MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS. ALRIGHT SO A POINT HAS BEEN MADE SENATOR STERN WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND ON THAT POINT AND I WILL I'LL ASK YOU TO DO THAT SO PRESELIO YEAH THANK YOU -- BE COMPLETE I WOULD I WOULD CONTEST A THE ALLEGED FACTS. OH BY SIMPLY STATING THAT. OF THE FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS IS IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BUT OF THE DIRECT ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION INTO AFRICA IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING JOBS IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES TO SOMEHOW SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE HUNTING TO SURVIVE. IS NOT ACCURATE -- TOURISM ALONE IS CONTRIBUTE OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SUPPORTED OVER SIX MILLION JOBS IN AFRICA. AND VERY OFTEN THE THE HUNTING AND ECO TOURISM ARE DIRECTLY IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER NOT ALWAYS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS BUT THE WAY THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED. WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEHOW THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A GONNA MAKE THOSE CERTIFICATIONS FAIRLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE. AVID HUNTERS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE SO I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN THEM TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE WHATEVER -- GOALS MISTER DINGELL MAY HAVE -- BUT MORE SO AND NICK CAN PROBABLY FILL YOU IN BUT THERE IS MORE MONEY COMING IN ON THE ECO TOURISM SIDE. THAN ON THE HUNTING SIDE TO SUPPORT THESE THREE SENATE ACTUALLY OF NUMBERS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES STATING THAT YET SO THE BECAUSE TERRORISM IS TERRORISM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE FOR YOU GET WATER FROM HUNTING BUT LET'S MILLION WITH A COUPLE YEAH ACCORDING TO ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOME [inaudible] SURE. TRIPCASE UGH ACCORDING TO HUMANE SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL -- TROPHY HUNTING REVENUE UP PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL TOURISM DOLLARS IS LESS THAN ONE WHERE SENATE THAT'S OCCURRING THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF AN INTERNATIONAL MEANS THE IDEA. AND GET US NOT ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE OF THESE COUNTRIES WELL THE PROBLEM WITH GETTING INFORMATION FROM THESE COUNTRIES IS THAT YOU CAN'T AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THAT I'M I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HIGHEST AT AYE MR SAID IN THE COUNTRIES THAT AS IN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SIR. RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE IT TO US BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A ROBUST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH THEY DON'T. ALRIGHT SO I DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THAT I LIKE THAT TAX MONEY WE WANNA QUESTION THINK. OKAY GO FOR IT ALRIGHT. SO I MEAN IT'S YOU YOU GUYS WILL ACTUALLY HOUSE ALL THE NUMBERS -- YOU KNOW THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE USE HERE -- WHAT WHAT ARE HONEY TAX THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS? THAT THE WHOLE DOT SYSTEMS OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HER. MUCH BETTER PUT TOGETHER QUITE FRANKLY THAN EVEN SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE HAVE HERE. IN THOSE REVENUES GO DIRECTLY. TOWARDS THAT END IN TOWARDS BENEFITING THOSE COMMUNITIES IT GOES IN THEIR SCHOOLS ARE GOES IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO HELP PROTECT. THESE ANIMALS IN IN AND FOR ALL THE REASONS FOR OF OF ALL YOU. LADIES WITH YOUR PHONE SHAKING YOUR HEADS NO AT ME AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET THE FACTS -- BE BECAUSE OF YOU TRULY WANT TO PROTAGONISTS. THESE ENVIRONMENTS YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO FUND IT THAT MR MATHIS WOULD YOU DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE NOT TO THE CROWD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GARCIA -- I IDEAS I HAVE GREAT CONCERN OVER THIS BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES HIT HERE WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE GONNA DICTATE. THAT A POSSIBLE FUNDING FORMULA FOR EIGHTH ANOTHER COUNTRY TO SURVIVE IN AND WE HAVE NO BUSINESS. DOING THAT IF THEY WANTED OUR HELP THEY REACH OUT JUST IN GOOD HEALTH. AND THEY'VE GOT. WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS GOING ON THERE ARE CONTRIBUTING THAT ARE FUNDING THIS [inaudible] AND THE THERE'S SO MANY DOCUMENT. MEMORIES ON THIS AND THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS. IN TO TO OUTLINEDIN INDIGO EVEN WITH -- SOMEONE FREEMAN'S COMMENTS. I MEAN SOME OF THE THE PIECES OF THE BILL. GET INTO THAT THE CELL THE OWNERSHIP IN IN THESE PIECES RUNNING FULLY PUT TOGETHER. ARAMBULA LOT OF CONCERNS WITH YOUR BILL -- I I KNOW YOU WORK HARD ON YOUR LEGISLATION SENATOR -- WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU MORE ON IT -- IT TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] AND SOONER XIN DID YOU WANNA REQUIRE CAN WE HAVE SOME OTHER MEMBERS YEAH THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- I I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER PER. ONE OF THE THE LAW [inaudible] FORGET [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YES IT [inaudible] AGAINST [inaudible] THERE ARE. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NOBODY'S -- TO COMPARE THAT. OF WITH THIS THIRTY DAY. GET OUT OF THE STATE MISSION. I FIND THAT THIS BILL. IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE NEW JERSEY LAW. I THAT WAS CITED. THAT WITH THE FACT THAT COME OUT OF BY THE BOARD SO THAT REASON. I THINK THAT THE I'LL BE VOTING. IN OPPOSITION. IT'S JUST A HARPER SCAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LIBYAN. OF MY END OF THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- YOU KNOW. THREE MONTHS AGO THE LAST MALE NORTHERN WHITE RHINO DIED -- AND IN JUST LOOKING AT EVEN WHAT'S IN THE US STAFF ANALYSIS FOR THE STAFF TO WE COMMEND THE STOP DOING A GOOD JOB IN THE NOW SAYS -- UNITED NATIONS WORLD TOURISM ORGANIZATION OF THE FIFTY SIX MILLION CHIPS AFTER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WILDLIFE WATCHING. FIRMS IN 80% OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL SALES [inaudible] ARM. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SUBSAHARAN AFRICA OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS POURED OVER SIX POINT ONE MILLION JOBS THOSE ARE FACTS. SAYING THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DOCUMENTARIES IS NOT BACKED -- THOUGH THE REALITY IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PUT IN REAL THOUGHTFUL CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. YOU SEE ABOUT THEIR* ONE ANOTHER ONE THIRTY THE ELEPHANT'S TODAY I'M REALLY WENT AFTER POACHERS AND THE BAND HUNTING -- A BOOK THE DAY THEY MAY MAKE HUNTING ILLEGAL. SO YES AND I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN STATED BECAUSE THAT'S THE STORY CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. BECAUSE THERE ISN'T OTHER ALTERNATIVES. AND THERE ISN'T A MARKET DEMAND TO CREATE THOSE OTHER ALTERNATIVES WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD LEAD TO HAVE INFLUENCE OVER WHAT. OTHER NATIONS DO AND WE HAVE TO LIVE BY OUR VALUES NOT BY OTHERS VALUES [inaudible] AND CURRENTLY SOME OF THE NATION'S OF ACTION PLANS DEPENDENT ON HUNTING. WE CAN HELP TRANSFER A FORM OF THOSE ECONOMIES JUST LIKE IN SOME OTHER AFRICAN COLONIES TO ECO TOURISM BY. SLOWING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THEY GET FROM THAT ASPECT OF THE INDUSTRY AND GROWING DEMAND REVENUE THEY GET FROM ECO TOURISM AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ANIMAL FRIENDLY. POLICIES SO WE DICTATE AS A PLANET AND CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA'S THE PRIVILEGED ECONOMY PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN THAT WEATHER IS THROUGH A CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH CONSUMER CLUB OF CONSUMER PROTECTION YOU NAME IT THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THIS ISN'T ACCEPTABLE FOR US IS CALIFORNIANS PRINT. AND AND WE CAN THEREBY HELPED PROMOTE THE HEALTHIER ASPECTS OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IN THOSE NATIONS THAT ACTUALLY CREATE FAR MORE JOBS. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER Q.. AND SECULAR MCROBBIE SUPPORTING HIS BILL BUT I WANNA ALSO. A GIPSON COMMITMENT AND WOULD LOVE BUT POINT OUT OF BROUGHT UP BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FREEMAN. YOU WILL WILL HAPPEN IF I HAVE SOMETHING. AGO WAS PASSED ON BY MY GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD WHAT DO I NEED TO DO. I THINK YOU KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND WE HAD THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. I HOPE TO GET A VERY VERY CLEAR DIRECTION YOU KNOW YOU THROUGH ASKED ME TO GO TO SOMEBODY -- BUT A TO TO VERIFY THAT THAT THEY NEED NOBLES OF PECULIAR. IT WILL BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR FOR THOSE PEOPLE PAGES BRETT GOT SOMETHING. ON THERE YOU KNOW GRAHAM GRANDMA MAY JUST. THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE IS NOT. TO GO AFTER HAND ME DOWNS OR THE ITEMS THAT ARE WITHIN FAMILIES POSSESSION IT'S ABOUT THE BIG DOLLAR TRADE. WE DON'T WANT TO GO AFTER GRANDMOTHERS HERE UNLESS THOSE GRANDMOTHERS ARE PART OF A LARGE SCALE -- ENDANGERED SPECIES TRAIT SO BUT I I APPRECIATE THE POINT I DON'T MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO BE FLIP WITH YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I'M. I I I WILL LOOK AT THE THE PROVISIONS THAT THAT WE WE SORT OF PUT IN HERE TO POLKA THAT. THAT DETERMINATION AND WE DON'T WANT THAT -- THAT PAUL CAST OVER EVERY FAMILY TO HAVE TO GO THEN BACK AND LOOK THROUGH KNICKKNACKS IN THEIR DRAWERS OR YOU KNOW AND IN A SIMILAR FRIEDMAN'S CASE YOU KNOW THROUGH AN ANTIQUE SHOP. BUT THIS IS ABOUT A THEM THE MARKET IN THESE PARTS AT ITS AT AT A MUCH LARGER SCALE SO BUT I I DO APPRECIATE THE SENSE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHESTER GALLAGHER. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR AND AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR NOT GONNA GO AFTER GRANDMOTHERS YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD THING -- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK ONE THING IN AT SOME THAT I THAT I TRY TO EMPHASIZE EVEN WITH WITH HUNTING HERE DOMESTICALLY RIGHT IS AND AND I THINK THIS POISON MAY BUT I I THINK IT'S DESERVES EMPHASISES THAT. THE HUNTERS ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIONISTS. THERE THE SOURCE OF THE REVENUE FOR ALLOW THE CONSERVATION EFFORTS I MEAN AS I THINK WAS MENTIONED DUCKS UNLIMITED SO IN MY IN MY DISTRICT IS YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE THE MIGRATORY BIRDS WATERFOWL A POPULATION THAT COMES ON THE PACIFIC FLYWAY. WE'VE WE HAVE CREATED HUGE AMOUNTS OF HABITAT. AND THAT AREA A LOT OF IT IS DONE BY HUNTERS [inaudible] AND RANCHERS -- SO YOU KNOW I HAVE SO MILD LEGISLATION IS TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THAT PRACTICE MORE COVER CROPS. THINGS THAT SUPPORT THAT BUT AND AND IT SEEMS TO ME FROM LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION -- SURROUNDING THE ISSUE I'VE BY TOLD UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT THESE. WE ARE HUNTERS THAT ARE GOING BACK -- ARE ACTUALLY GENERATE A LOT OF REVENUE TO HELP SUPPORT CONSERVATION AT THE WAS POINTED OUT -- NOW THERE ARE DISPARITIES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF OF AFRICA -- WHERE? WHERE THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT AND THERE HAVE AND AND WE NEED TO HAVE STRONGER? ANTI POACHING -- EFFORTS TO STOP THIS UNITS TRACKS HER [inaudible] BUT ON YOU KNOW BUT NO TO KIND OF PUT THIS KIND OF JUST A BLANKET. PROHIBITION GOING FORWARD -- SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET OUT THE ISSUE OF THE OF THE PROTEIN. AND IT MAY HAVE THE THE UNINTENDED IMPACT OF OF CUTTING DOWN ON THE REVENUE THAT HELP SUPPORT. CONSERVATION PROGRAMS BACK IN AFRICA AND HELPING TO SUPPORT THE SPECIES THAT I THINK EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE AGREES -- WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM IN THE HISTORY BOOKS WE DON'T WE WANT YOU KNOW WE WANT THE WE WANT THE SPECIES PRESERVE A PART OF THAT THE PART OF GOOD CONSERVATION PRACTICES IS HUNTING TO BECAUSE THERE ARE CASES -- WHERE WHERE THERE IS OVERPOPULATION? AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANIMAL STARVING BECAUSE OF THE OVER POPULATION. THEN YOU SHOULD SUPPORT. RESPONSIBLE HUNTING CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND SO. WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS AN UNATTENDED CONSEQUENCES GOING TO HURT THE VERY THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE? AND SO I MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST KIND RESPOND YOU KNOW TO THAT. YEAH A PART OF YOUR WE WANT THOSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS TO CONTINUE IT ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT WORKING. RIGHT LIKE THEY'RE THERE MAKE IT THEY'RE MAKING A GO AT IT BUT AND THERE IS SIT THERE ARE SOME WINS OUT THERE BUT ON THE WHOLE. THE CONTINENT IS IN DECLINE I MEAN THESE ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES ON THESE WATCHLISTS WITH STUDIES AND THE I. U. C. N. FOR A REASON RIGHT. THERE THEY MAY NOT SURVIVE THIS GENERATION SO SOMETHING HAS GOT TO CHANGE HOW WE'RE APPROACHING THIS PROBLEM ISN'T WORKING AND I THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT ABOUT DUCKS ARE CALIFORNIA HABITAT. IN THIS REALLY UNIQUE I I APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLE THE SO A VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. A VERY LIMITED LIST OF ICONIC SPECIES THAT -- ARE CLEARLY ENDANGERED -- ARE CLEARLY IN DECLINE THE FACTS ARE NOT IN DISPUTE ON THAT ARE ON THE WHOLE IN THAT CONTINENT. THESE SPECIES ARE ARE ARE YOU KNOW COLLAPSE -- AND AGAIN THAT THE SYSTEM WE CAN WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON WHAT THE BEST WAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM IS. OUR PREMISE IS THAT ECO TOURISM AND THESE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF OF TOURISM ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE ABOUT GETTING DOLLARS BACK LOCALLY THEN HUNTING INDUSTRY AND I'M AND I'M NOT SAYING ALL HUNTING IS POACHING BY THE WAY AYE AYE THAT'S THINK THAT'S NOT THE YEAH I I SHOULD STATE THAT. FOR THE RECORD AND I YOU KNOW THAT. AND WOMEN ARE HUNTERS TO AYE AYE AYE ALSO WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT I DON'T I DON'T ACTUALLY. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE WOMAN OR MAN IF YOU'RE HUNTING AND ENDANGERED SPECIES -- IT'S A PROBLEM -- FOR FOR AT LEAST FOR ME IS A CALIFORNIA'S THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT IN TERMS OF MONITORING OR SOME WAY TO SORT OF ACTUALLY. IMPROVE OUR DATA SETS I THINK WE'VE GOT ABOUT AS GOOD AS WE CAN GET OUT OF THE CURRENT STATE OF GOVERNMENT DATA COMING FROM AFRICA RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S BEEN. AS YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY CHALLENGING GOVERNMENTS TO INTERACT WITH AND I YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW TO BEEN BROKER THOSE DEALS AND REALLY PUSH THE CONSERVATION AGENDA. WHICH IS WHY I THINK CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO STEP IN SO I I DO APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM ON IT AND YET THIS IS. THIS IS OUR EFFORT TO SORT OF RE ORIENT ECOMMERCE GLOBALLY TO SAY THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO SAFETY. HAVE I JUST IF OPPOSITION MAYBE CAN RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL CHAIRS DESCRIPTION. WELL YES SIR -- FIRST THINK THERE'S I MENTION BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS TO FLY. WOULD TALK ABOUT DOWN. THE ECO TOURISM IT WITH A LIVE MANY HUNTING IS REALLY ELIMINATING THE WINGS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE CONSERVATION SYSTEM FLY AS MY ANALOGY BUT THE WELL LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT THE LODGES IN TANZANIA. AND ELSEWHERE OR HALF EMPTY. OKAY. AS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ECO TOURISM THE COVER THIS AND ECO TOURISTS DON'T PAY. THE FEAST OF THE GOVERNMENT. ARE THEY ARE LIKE LIKE THE HUNTING GOES IT'S OF IS THAT THE CATAPULT CONSERVATION PARADIGM IN SOUTHERN THESE IN AFRICA IS BASED UPON SAFARI HONEY TOURISTS A FOR HONEY. ITSELF IT WORKS IT'S ALWAYS POPULATIONS IN A STABLE OR INCREASING AND THE DEATHLY OR SECURE. SERVICES PUT ON ABOUT DON'T CUT THE WINGS OFF THE BIRDS. OKAY WE WE ARE JUST SAY THAT BY. NO ONE BECAUSE MORE CONCLUSION. ONE NO ONE CARES MORE ABOUT -- BUT THESE ANIMALS HUNTERS THEY NEED US AS MUCH AS WE NEED THEM CAN'T HOA WE CAN'T SHOOT DUCKS WE CAN HELP THIRTEEN MILLION ACRES OF A WETLAND HABITAT WITHOUT BOOKS ONLINE OKAY EMITTED THANK YOU. A IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENT YES MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD I KNOW IN THE CONVERSATION IS NOT EASY IT'S VERY CHALLENGING. BUT AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE INABILITY TO HUNTS. DUCKS OR GEESE OR DEAR THIS IS ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES AND I'M I'M SAD TO SAY THAT. YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE WHITE RHINOCEROS NO LONGER EXISTS. AND IT'S INCLUDED IN AND THE BILL AND I THINK THAT'S THE A TRAVESTY TO OUR PLANET. AND DOES REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD IN A VERY HAPPY. THANKS MISS CARILLO. WE GOT TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I HER. WORK. THEN I HEARD A MOTION FROM A NEWS RUBIO AND SECONDED BY -- MISS KOREA. AND MR GLORIA [inaudible] AND A LOT OF OTHERS MISTER CHAIRMAN COULD YOU INDULGE ME FOR TEN SECONDS NO WE WE TOOK OTHERS IT THERE'S AN EXTREMELY JIMMY. I IT SO WE'LL WE'LL KEEP THIS HERE AT THE DAIS IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- SEEN NONE APPEAR I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ALL AND A LOT A COMMENTARY ABOUT -- ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN ABOUT THE CONSERVATION FUNDS I DO WANT -- TO DRAW PEOPLE TO THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS WRITTEN BY COMMITTEE STAFF THAT DOES I'D DOCUMENT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. SO WE HAVE ABOUT A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT TO SUB SAHARAN AFRICA A ANNUALLY -- THIS WAS BASED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY THE WILL TRAVEL AND TOURISM COUNCIL AND WE HAVE DATA ON THE THE HUNTING. IMPACT -- WHICH IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YEAR OF REVENUE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NUMBERS WERE PRETTY CLEAR -- AYE -- I MYSELF HAVE BEEN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA TWICE INTO MY SOME ARE I'VE BEEN TO THE SERENGETI BEAUTIFUL PLACES I DIDN'T BRING HOME ANY TROPHIES THANK GOODNESS I THINK. THERE MUST BE A SOLIS SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT THAT WOULD DRIVE ANYONE TO WANT. TO KILL AND MURDER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND AND SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE AT THE SERVICE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING US SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. AND A PROTECT THE SPECIES ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSERVATION -- FOR A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC STORY DOCUMENTS DOCUMENTARIES WERE WERE MENTIONED A A STORY -- REPORT WAS. WRITTEN ABOUT HOW IT WAS NOTORIOUSLY HARD TO PIN DOWN. I'M I'M REALLY JUST LIFTING A STRAIGHT FROM THE ANALYSIS IT SO GOOD OUT WHETHER CONSERVATION FUNDS WERE PROPERLY USED. AND THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN KLEPTOCRACY. TRACK WHETHER FOR CONSERVATION FUNDS ACTUALLY CONSERVED THESE THREATEN ANIMALS. AND THAT TRUCK TROPHY HUNTING MAY ACTUALLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE.
