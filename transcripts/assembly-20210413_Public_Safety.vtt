01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.792
ATTACHED TO MONIQUE AND TO.

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.427
THERE WAS CORROBORATED FALSE

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:27.962
TESTIMONY OF AN IN CUSTODY

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.098

INNOCENT PERSON BEING

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.834
CONVICTED. THE CONVICTION OF A

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.836
SINGLE PERSON FOR A CRIME HERE

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:36.571
SHE DIDN'T COMMIT IS TOO MANY.

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:37.872
BUT IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.173
SCALE OF THE ALLEGED PROBLEM

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.908
THIS BILL PURPORTS TO ADDRESS

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.110
THE SPONSORS WOULD NEED TO

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.311
PROVIDE DATA THAT SHOWS HOW

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.513

TESTIMONY AND HELPED CONVICT A

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.285
GUILTY PERSON. WE WOULD IMAGINE

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.453
THAT THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.988
HAVE EXAMPLES OF I WOULD

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.156
DISCUSS THE MONEY IN SERIOUS

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.725
CASES. IN WHICH DNA OR LATER

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.293

EXCLUDE EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY.

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.800
SIMILARLY WE WOULD EXPECT THAT

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.034
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF FALSE

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:08.336
CONFESSIONS THAT WERE NOT

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:09.737
COERCED THAT HAVE LED TO

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:11.472
INNOCENT PEOPLE BEING CONVICTED

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.074
AND INCARCERATED. ARE WE NEXT

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.609
GOING TO EXCLUDE CONFESSIONS

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:15.676
FROM BEING ENTERED INTO

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.311
EVIDENCE. AS I USED TO TELL

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:18.946
JURIES WHEN TRYING CASES THE

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.581
JURY SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:22.316
BECAUSE NO SYSTEM DEVISED BY

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.418
MORTALS COULD BE. HOWEVER IS

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.853
THE BEST SYSTEM HUMANITY HAS

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.488
EVER KNOWN AND IT IS BASED ON

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.123
RESPECT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.925
JURORS. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:32.827
PROPERLY ASSESS ALL EVIDENCE

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.262
INCLUDING EVIDENCE THAT COMES

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.164
FROM LAY WITNESSES EXPERT

WITNESSES AND YES IN CUSTODY

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:39.467
INFORMANTS. THAT COLLECTIVE

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.235
INTELLIGENCE IS REINFORCED BY

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.770
JUDGES WHO GUIDE THEM AND

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:45.606
EVALUATING SUCH TESTIMONY. THE

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:46.774
REPEAL OF THE TRUTH AND

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:47.708

HAVING CONCERN FOR THE

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.524
SEVENTEEN THAT ARE WRONGFULLY

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:18.492
CONVICTED. AND I SHARE THOSE

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:21.862
CONCERNS AND I THINK WE NEED TO

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.465
WORK ON WAYS TO ENSURE. JUST AS

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:26.567
THE ONE OF THE WITNESSES STATED

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:27.501
THAT LESS AND LESS OF THAT

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:30.304
HAPPENS. BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT ON

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:31.872
OUR LITTLE AUDIENCE THAT

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.874
DOESN'T EXIST HERE TODAY. IF

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.209
YOU TAKE EVERYONE OF THOSE

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:36.711
CHAIRS EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ROW

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.312
THAT GENTLEMAN AND PUT PEOPLE

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.815
IN THERE AND THEN FILL THIS

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:43.684
UNDER SECTION THAT'S HERE. WITH

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.987
ONE ROW PLUS FOUR SEATS. THAT'S

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.755
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:49.657
THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED BY

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.959
THIS PROCESS. AND PEOPLE THAT

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:54.095
YOU SAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED BY

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:55.830
THE PROCESS AND THE PEOPLE THAT

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:56.797
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED BY THAT

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:59.734
PROCESS REPRESENT RAPISTS

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.970
pMURDERERS. ROBBERS VIOLENT

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:07.241
FELONS- IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:10.177
THOSE PEOPLE. THEIR FAMILIES

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:12.213
WANT JUSTICE. AND THEIR

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.415
FAMILIES DESERVE JUSTICE AND TO

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:17.084
SAY BECAUSE THE SEVENTEEN WE

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.285
NEED TO WORK ON THEIR PROBLEMS

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.854
A LITTLE BIT MORE MAKE SURE

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.523
THEY'RE NOT UNJUSTLY. CONVICTED

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.258
AND WE'RE GOING TO SACRIFICE

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.327
THE OTHERS IT'S A LITTLE TOO

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.230
MUCH FOR ME. SO I WILL NOT BE

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:31.966
SUPPORTING THIS BILL- I THINK

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.134
THERE ARE WAYS AND TEY'RE

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.835
BECOMING BETTER WAYS OF

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:36.337
ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:41.008
FALSE TESTIMONY. AND THAT THOSE-

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:44.945
WAYS THAT THAT ARE ARE BEING.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.981
AND YET THE- HOW HOW WOULD I

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:49.150
WANT TO SAY THAT THE FACTORS

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:50.718
THAT ARE IN COMMON THEY'RE

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:51.919
CONVICTING PEOPLE THAT

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:54.088
SHOULDN'T BE CONVICTED ARE

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:55.923
BEING FLESHED OUT WHAT

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:59.326
TECHNOLOGY AND- AND FRANKLY

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:02.930
WITH COMMON SENSE- WE WILL

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.765
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THAT.

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:05.933
BUT WE CAN'T SACRIFICE THE

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.002
OTHER 83% OF SUCCESSFUL

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.837
CONVICTIONS BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.973
THANK YOU. CAN I GET YOUR

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.175
CORRECT CAN I JUST CLARIFY

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.543
SOMETHING RUDE I THINK IT'S

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:17.912
IMPORTANT. THE SADISTIC WAS NOT

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.780
THAT OUT OF ALL OF THE TECH THE

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.282
CONVICTIONS THAT WERE OBTAINED

01:35:21.348 --> 01:35:24.018
WITH JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS 17%

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.353
OF THOSE ARE INACCURATE. IT'S

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.722
OUT OF ALL THE CONVICTIONS MOST

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:30.024
OF WHICH DON'T USE JAILHOUSE

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:31.525
CONFORMANCE OF ALL THE WRONGFUL

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:35.629
CONVICTIONS 17% OF THAT TOTAL.

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:36.831
EXCLUDING THE ONES THAT DIDN'T

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:38.866
USED JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS 70%

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:39.700
OF PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW WERE

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:42.937
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED SINCE

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:43.504
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. HAD TO

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:46.674
YOU HAD. THE USE OF ITACCURATE

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.375
OF LYING JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS I

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:49.677
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO THAT WE

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:51.679
ALL UNDERSTAND THIS INTERESTED

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:54.148
LACKEY THREE PERCENT. IS ALSO

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:56.584
THE SAME CATEGORY. OKAY MR

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:59.854
LACKEY. YEAH I THINK YOU YOU DO

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.923
BRING UP A- A CONCERN AND I DO

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.624
BELIEVE THE NET CUSSED

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.392
INFORMANT'S TESTIMONY. SHOULD

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:06.760
BE USED WITH CAUTION AND

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:08.395
CLEARLY INCENTIVIZE TESTIMONY

01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:10.531
NOT USED. HOWEVER I THINK THE

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:14.068
BAND IS TOO STRONG. AND I THINK.

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.703
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT- FLAT

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:19.106
BAND. OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:20.608
WILL MAKE INVESTIGATION IN

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:23.511
PRISON CRIMES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.246
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S- THAT'S

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:27.615
MY CONCERN AND I DO THINK YOU

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.283
HAVE A STRONG ISSUE HERE THE

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:31.685
DESERVES. SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:33.354
I JUST DON'T THINK THIS QUITE I

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.955
THINK THIS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY.

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.157
AND SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:37.458
SUPPORT IT BUT I DO SUPPORT

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:39.126
YOUR EFFORTS AND THE

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:41.362
PERSPECTIVE OF TAKING A LOOK AT

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:43.097
IT BECAUSE OF THE TESTIMONY.

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.366
THANK YOU SPARKING. THANK YOU

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:47.968
MISTER CHAIR AND- I WANT TO

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.170
START BY THINKING THE AUTHOR

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.638
FOR THIS WORK I LIKE YOUR

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:51.906
WITNESSES REPRESENTED A MAN ON

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.874
DEATH ROW WHO WAS PUT THERE FOR

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.177
TEN YEARS- WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:58.179
USING A JAILHOUSE INFORMANT.

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.480
AND HE LOST TEN YEARS OF HIS

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.215
LIFE HE WASN'T OUT OF JAIL WHEN

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:03.150
HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WAS BORN HE

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:05.219
WAS IN ISOLATION ON DEATH ROW

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:06.453
FOR THOSE YEARS WHICH YOU CAN

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.087
ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED HIS

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:10.691
MENTAL STATE. AND HE WAS LUCKY

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.393
ENOUGH TO END UP WITH. A

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:14.128
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WHO IS

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:15.196
WILLING TO TAKE ON HIS CASE PRO

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.198
BONO. AND AS A RESULT HE ENDED

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:19.233
UP WITH LAWYERS THE COULD TAKE

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.335
ON HIS CASE MYSELF AND MY TEAM.

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.604
AND WE GOT HIM OUT. THAT WAS

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.305
TEN YEARS LATER YOU HEARD

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:26.373
ABOUT. THE GENTLEMAN THIS

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.508
LAWYER REPRESENTED THIRTY SEVEN

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.310
YEARS LATER. SO I ALSO WANT TO

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.545
MAKE CLEAR THAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:32.146
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.614
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. THE

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.082
NUMBER IS THAT MISS FRIEDMAN IS

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:36.317
DISCUSSING ARE THE ONES THAT WE

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:38.319
HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO GET

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:39.920
RELEASED TO THERE ARE MANY MORE

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:41.455
OF THEM I BELIEVE IN JAIL THAN

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:43.123
THOSE THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:47.995
KNOW ABOUT. AND. TO HAVE. LIVED

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.096
AND WORKED IN THE CRIMINAL

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:51.031
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SEE THE

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.234
FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEM. AND YES

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.102
SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND WHEN IT

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.770
WORKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.372
PEOPLE DESERVE JUSTICE AND

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.474
SOMETIMES IT FAILS PEOPLE AND

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.709
IT FAILED THE VICTIMS IN THE

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:03.510
CASE THAT I WORKED ON AS WELL.

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.712
BECAUSE YEARS LATER WE WERE

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.480
LETTING A MAN WHO DIDN'T COMMIT

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:07.481
THAT CRIME AND THEY DIDN'T GET

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.650
JUSTICE BECAUSE THE PERSON

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:10.284
ACTUALLY DID KILL THOSE FAMILY

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.353
MEMBERS. HAD WALKED THE STREETS

01:38:12.419 --> 01:38:14.388
ALL THOSE YEARS AND SO WE'RE

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.756
THEIR WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS I

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:16.724
BELIEVE THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:17.925
FILLED AS WELL I DON'T BELIEVE

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.226
IT IS JUST THE PERSON WHO IS IN

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:21.795
JAIL EVERYBODY HAS BEEN FELT IN

01:38:21.862 --> 01:38:22.363
THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I CRIME

01:38:22.429 --> 01:38:25.199
HAPPENED. AND SO WHAT WE NEED

01:38:25.266 --> 01:38:26.200
TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.735
JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. AND IT

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.169
WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. THAT WE

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.971
ARE NOT INCARCERATING SOMEONE

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.006
FOR ONE DAY FOR A CRIME THEY

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.574
DIDN'T COMMIT. WE HAVE TAKEN

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:34.675
THEIR FREEDOM AWAY AND WE NEED

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:35.909
TO TAKE THAT INCREDIBLY

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:38.345
INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY. WHICH IS

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:38.912
WHY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:40.648
SYSTEM WE GIVE EXTRA PROTECTION

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:41.849
THAT'S WHY WE PROVIDE COUNSEL

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.450
PRO BONO. RIGHT THROUGH PUBLIC

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.318
DEFENDERS ARE COMING JUSTICE

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.986
SYSTEM. SOMETHING WE DON'T DO

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:47.121
IN CIVIL SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:47.988
BELIEVE TAKING SOMEONE'S

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:49.723
FREEDOM AWAY IS SO IMPORTANT

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:50.524
THAT THEY DESERVE EVERY

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.760
POSSIBLE PROTECTION. AND THIS

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:53.727
IS GETTING A PROBLEM THAT IS

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.095
VERY REAL AND I'VE SEEN

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.031
FIRSTHAND. AND I THINK THAT I

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:57.998
REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.166
AUTHOR AND THOSE THAT ARE

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:00.000
BRINGING THIS WORD FOR THIS

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:01.068
VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.369
I WANT TO ADDRESSING US

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:03.370
INCENTIVES ACTUALLY NOT

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:06.106
ACCURATE. SO THE BILL. DEFINES

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.042
IN CUSTODY IN FORMAT AS SOMEONE

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.843
OTHER THAN A CODEFENDANT AND

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.845
ACCOMPLICE A CO CONSPIRATOR OR

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:15.049
PERCIPIENT WITNESS. SO FOR JAIL

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:16.917
FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN JAIL.

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.319
SOMEBODY WAS IN CUSTODY WOULD

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:19.953
BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS. MAYBE

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.088
THEY WITNESSED IT. MAYBE

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.489
THEY'RE A CO CONSPIRATOR AND

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:23.023
THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.692
TESTIFY UNDER THIS BILL. SO

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:26.160
THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT I JUST

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:27.861
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT INACCURACY

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:28.696
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.064
BILL DOES AND I WAS ACTUALLY

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:33.600
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:34.234
BILL. SOMETHING I LOOKED INTO.

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:35.002
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A- EVEN

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:36.103
IF. THAT'S A CRIME WAS

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:36.837
COMMITTED ONE OF THE CO

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:38.739
CONSPIRATORS GOES TO JAIL. AND

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.207
IS NOW IN CUSTODY THAT PERSON

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.409
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TESTIFY. AND

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:43.410
YOUR BILL ALLOWS THAT AND I

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.378
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:45.946
AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION SO.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.481
DESPITE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:48.082
SAID THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE

01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:50.284
BAN. IT IS A BAN ON THOSE THAT

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:51.885
ARE USING THIS IN CUSTODY

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.587
INFORMANT TO. GET THE

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:54.688
PRIVILEGES THAT THEY GET BY

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:56.924
DOING IT AND THAT IS. I ALSO

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.791
WANT TO POINT OUT IMPORTANT

01:39:57.858 --> 01:39:59.460
THING ABOUT THIS BILL. WHICH IS

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:01.495
NOTHING STOPS IN IN CUSTODY

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:03.797
INDIVIDUAL FROM COMING FORWARD.

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:05.232
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TO

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:06.567
ANYBODY AND SAYING. I HEARD

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:07.568
THIS GUY SAY HE COMMITTED THIS

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:09.837
CRIME. AND HELPING SOLVE THAT

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:11.505
CRIME. AND THEN HAVING LAW

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:12.873
ENFORCEMENT GO OUT SOLVE THAT

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:13.974
CRIME GET THE CORROBORATING

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.876
EVIDENCE. AND PUT ON A CASE AND

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:17.678
PUT THAT PERSON IN JAIL. THANK

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.012
HAS TO BE INFORMED IS IMPORTANT

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:20.481
THEY NO LONGER ARE ADMISSIBLE

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:22.216
IN A COURT OF LAW. BUT THEY

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:23.283
SERVED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.351
SOLVING THAT CRIME THAT IS

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.686
STILL ABSOLUTELY ALLOWABLE

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.755
UNDER THIS IS. ABOUT THE

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.089
ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:30.858
WHICH IS DIFFERENT. THAN THEIR

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.192
ROLE IN SOLVING THE CRIME AND I

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.560
THINK BOTH OF THOSE POINTS ARE

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:34.928
REALLY CRITICAL AND WHY THIS

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:36.363
BILL IS WELL CRAFTED IN WHITE

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.164
GETS IT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.166
ASKING WHICH IS. WHAT WE ARE

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:40.300
PUTTING FORWARD IN A COURT OF

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:42.002
LAW TO PUT SOMEONE IN JAIL.

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:44.004
SHOULD BE RELIABLE TESTIMONY.

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:45.239
AND THEY'RE SUCH SERIOUS

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:45.806
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:46.940
RELIABILITY THIS TESTIMONY DO

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:47.941
WE NEED TO LOOK HARD AT

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:48.709
OURSELVES AND SAY IS THIS

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.310
APPROPRIATE. I THINK THAT'S THE

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:51.578
QUESTION BEING ASKED AND I LOOK

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:52.546
FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT THANK

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:54.114
YOU. THANK YOU. I JUST WANNA

01:40:54.181 --> 01:41:01.188
MAKE A ONE CLARIFYING. ISSUES

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.089
STATED THAT. THESE PRISON. OF

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:04.425
THAT HAPPENED. CLEARLY IN THE

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:06.226
PRESENCE OF OTHER- IT BECAUSE

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:08.695
THE PEOPLE. THEY COULD TESTIFY

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:10.764
WHAT THEY SEE BUT NOT WHAT THEY

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:17.204
HEAR. THAT'S MY CLARITY. I

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:19.106
GUESS WE SHOULD ASK FOR ONE OF

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:19.907
THE ATTORNEYS TO CLARIFY

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:21.308
BECAUSE I THINK IF THEY HEAR IT

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.043
AS A WITNESS IF I SEE A CRIME

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:26.046

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:36.924

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:45.619
OPPOSITION COMPARED THIS

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:47.321
WITNESS TO I. TO I. WITNESS

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:48.789
TESTIMONY BEING AN ACCURATE NOW

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.123
WILL BE LEARNING MORE MORE

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:51.758
ABOUT HOW I WITNESS TESTIMONY

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:53.393
CAN BE INACCURATE BUT I THINK

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.127
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:55.095
DIFFERENCE OF SOMEBODY WHO

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:56.563
MAKES A MISTAKE. FOR A VARIETY

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.432
OF REASONS AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.767
A BUILT IN A BIAS ARE AN

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:02.936
INCENTIVE TO LIE OR TO PRETEND

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:04.137
THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.472
DON'T AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.174
REMEMBER THAT WITH THIS AND

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.942
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE KNOWN

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:10.143
ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS FOR MANY

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.812
MANY YEARS WE KEEP SEEING THESE

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:13.313
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OVER AND

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:16.583
OVER AGAIN AND AS- MY-

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:20.854
COLLEAGUES- FROM SANTA CLARA.

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:24.057
OF SOMEWHERE IN SOMEONE-

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.692
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR QUE HAN

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.594

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.697
SPOKE SO POWERFULLY IN SO WELL

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.299
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.668
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG I AND I

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:35.636
REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAD A

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:37.304

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.272

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:41.808
17% ACCURACY WE WOULD JUST NOT

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:01.895
PROBLEM WOULD LIKE BETTER

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:03.730
PARAMETERS IF THEY COME TO US

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:05.599
AND GIVE US TWO EXAMPLES WHERE

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:06.667
THEY REALLY NEED SOMETHING AS A

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:08.301
TOOL AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:11.104
CAN REALLY SHOW THAT- THEY CAN

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.706
HAVE SAFEGUARDS WE ARE OPEN TO

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:13.874

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.242
THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.743
VOTE ON THE FLOOR WE WANT TO

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:18.612
MAKE THIS PROTECTIVE BUT ALSO

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:20.147
TO NOT TAKE AWAY TOOLS. THAT

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:31.291
CONCERN THAT IT TO A BIGGER AS

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:33.293
WE CAN I'M SURE ADD LANGUAGE

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.895
ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO THIS IS

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:35.896

01:49:09.542 --> 01:49:10.677
SINCE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE

TODAY'S BILL DEALS WITH- AN

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.085
ELEMENT OF GUN VIOLENCE

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:19.586
PREVENTION CALLED MICRO

01:49:19.653 --> 01:49:21.755

A LICENSE PLATE FOR A BONE. MY

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:34.200
CRISTINA THING IS BEEN THE LAW

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:35.235
IN CALIFORNIA SINCE TWO

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:36.770
THOUSAND SEVEN. UNSAFE HANDGUN

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:39.172
ACT REQUIRES NEW SEMI AUTOMATIC

MICROCHIPPING TECHNOLOGY.

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:44.010
SUPPORTING THE GUN INDUSTRY HAS

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:45.812
EFFECTIVELY BOYCOTTED THE LAW.

01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:48.281
BY BY REFUSING TO DEVELOP NEW

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:48.949
HANDGUN MODELS FOR SALE

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.583
CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS BILL

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.385
SEEKS TO CHANGE THE EQUATION BY

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:54.020
REQUIRING FIREARMS USED BY LAW

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:55.422

WITH MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY NOW

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.291
ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO LEAD WITH

01:49:58.358 --> 01:50:00.093
OUR VALUES IN A WAY. THAT HAS

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.195
BROUGHT PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND AS

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.196
I SEE THERE ARE THREE BENEFITS

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.664
TO THIS APPROACH. THE FIRST IS

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:05.565
THAT WE'RE GONNA CREATE NEW

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:34.620
CRIMES IS THAT THE IDEOLOGY OR

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:36.155
WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW I DON'T

02:06:36.221 --> 02:06:37.823
KNOW YOU YOU'D HAVE TO. YOU'D

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.358
YOU'D YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE TO

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:40.392
ASK THEM DIRECTLY I DON'T WANT

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:41.493
TO SPEAK FOR THEM I THINK OKAY

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.661
HAVE HAVE THE MANUFACTURERS

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.129
HAVE GENERALLY BEEN BEEN

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:46.398
RESISTANT TO- TO ANY TYPE OF

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.067
REGULATION. AND SO I THINK IT

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.234
HAS MORE TO DO WITH THAT THAN

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:50.369
ANYTHING ELSE BUT AGAIN I DON'T

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:51.670
WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM. OUR GUN

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:55.507
USERS I KNOW IN SOME CASES-

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:59.178
THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT WANT- THIS

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:00.245
TECHNOLOGY OUT OF HAVE GUN

02:07:00.312 --> 02:07:03.015
USERS YOUR GUN USER GROUPS EVER

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:05.718
TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS. SO

02:07:05.784 --> 02:07:07.019
FAR AS AS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:18.664
NO NOT. NO NOT NONE OF THOSE

02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:20.232
GROUPS HAVE WEIGHED IN ON OUR

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:21.200
FOR NINE- AGAIN THIS IS REALLY

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.401
TARGETING LONG FOR RIGHT NOW- I

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:23.035
WOULD HAVE TO FOR THAT YOU KNOW

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:23.535
CHRIS CERTAIN WANT WANT

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:24.970
CRISTINA PROTECT- BUT I'M NOT

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:25.871
WHY ALLOW GONNA WOULD BE

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.540
CONCERNED IT. OKAY SO WHAT

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:31.343
HAPPENED IF. JULY ONE TWENTY

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.411
TWENTY THREE COMES BALLOT AND

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:36.315
NOBODY HAS- PUT OUT SOMETHING.

02:07:36.382 --> 02:07:38.584
WHAT'S THE FALL BACK WITH SO

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:39.418
THE FALL BACK THERE IS THAT

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:41.253
THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THE

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.422
WEAPONS THAT THEY HAVE AND GO

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:45.224
GET THE FIRING PIN ENGRAVED FOR

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:48.260
pFIRING TEN THAT HAS BEEN AT

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.595
LEAST ARE GREAT SO IT'S NOT

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.929
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ONLY HAVE

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:51.630
THE OPTION TO GO OUT THERE BY

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:53.065
THERE AND THAT'S WHY. I THINK

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:53.999
THE ARGUMENT WE HEARD FROM THE

02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:54.900
OPPOSITION THAT IT WOULD LIMIT

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.802
THE CHOICES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:57.436
FOR WHICH TYPE OF WEAPONS THEY

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.271
CAN USE I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.839
HOW THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:02.274
REALITY BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:03.542
CAN PURCHASE ANY TYPE OF WEAPON

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:04.710
THAT IT WANTS AND THEN GET THE

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.111
FIRING PENDING GREAT AFTER THE

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:07.246
FACT RIGHT AND THEN THEY'RE

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:09.515
OFF. ANY WEAPON THEY CARRY OFF

02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:12.885
DUTY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CORRECT

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:14.319
CORRECT THIS IS ABOUT WEAPONS

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.487
PURCHASED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR

02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:16.655
ANY WEAPON THAT THEY CARRY ON

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:19.525
TV OKAY HAS THE BILL BEEN MOVED

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:25.397
YET. YES OKAY THANK YOU FOR IT

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:26.865
YES. WICKS THANK YOU CHAIR I

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:28.634
JUST WANNA- THANK THE AUTHOR

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:29.535
FOR THE BILL I THINK IT'S

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:30.402
IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S SMART

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.137
TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE GRAPPLING

02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:34.606
WITH HOW TO- NAVIGATE THE GUN

02:08:34.673 --> 02:08:35.607
VIOLENCE OR SING IN OUR

02:08:35.674 --> 02:08:36.975
COMMUNITIES I THINK THIS IS.

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.911
ONE WAY THAT- WE CAN HOPEFULLY.

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.746
MITIGATE SOME OF THAT AND I.

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:41.947
ALSO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:43.082
TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:44.516
BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS.

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:46.318
HOPEFULLY BUT- I'M PROUD TO

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:46.919
SUPPORT THE BILL LOOKING OR

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:48.420
DEVOTING FOR. YEAH THINKING OF

02:08:48.487 --> 02:08:49.721
IF I MIGHT AS MEDICARE WE HAVE

02:08:49.788 --> 02:08:50.522
THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:51.857
ASSOCIATION NOTIFIED ME TODAY

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:52.991
AS I BELIEVE THEY DID THE

02:08:53.058 --> 02:08:53.625
COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAVE MOVED

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:55.461
FROM OPPOSED TO NEUTRAL- SO

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:56.895
WE'RE REALLY. LOOKING FORWARD

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:57.863
TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW

02:08:57.930 --> 02:08:59.131
ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS

02:08:59.198 --> 02:08:59.798
SUPPORTED PREVIOUS

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:01.533
MICROCHIPPING EFFORTS. YOU KNOW

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:02.901
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE GET A

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:03.802
LITTLE NERVOUS WHENEVER THERE'S

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:05.404
ANY TYPE OF NEW REQUIREMENT.

02:09:05.471 --> 02:09:06.472
BUT IS REALLY MY INTENTION TO

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:07.673
WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT GET

02:09:07.739 --> 02:09:08.474
TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:09.808
ACCOMMODATE. AS MANY OTHER

02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:11.009
CONCERNS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:12.611
THINK THEY- MORE THAN ANYONE

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:13.712
WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:14.646
TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT WILL HELP

02:09:14.713 --> 02:09:15.848
THEM IN SOLVING CRIMES WE KNOW

02:09:15.914 --> 02:09:17.983
FROM THE FBI. FOR MY TEN YEAR

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:20.986
STUDY THAT 70% OF NON FATAL-

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.321
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT INVOLVING

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:23.822
FIREARMS AREN'T SOLVED SO THIS

02:09:23.889 --> 02:09:24.823
IS ACTUALLY TOOL THAT'S GOING

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:28.994
TO HELP THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND

02:09:29.061 --> 02:09:29.561
HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR SOME AS

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:30.929
WELL. IT IS THAT YOU'RE CLOSE.

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:37.769
LIFE THAT AND- IN TERMS. SO BUT

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.905
I'M KIND OF STRONG WITH THE BAD

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:40.772
GUYS OUT THERE BECAUSE THAT IS

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:43.809
A GOOD WE DON'T. DO YOU KNOW

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:45.811
MOST OF THE LAW BY CITIZEN

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:46.445
WOULD NOT EVER HAVE TO WORRY OF

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:48.280
SOMEBODY IDENTIFIABLE THEY WENT

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:50.983
THROUGH SOMEBODY CAME FROM THEM-

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.651
IT'S THE BAD GUYS IS THEY DON'T

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:53.652
NECESSARILY BUY THEIR GUNS

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:55.954
FROM. FROM HERE NOW BUYING FROM

02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:59.191
DEALERS. AND THEY BUY AM FROM-

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:01.860
OTHER COUNTRIES. AND MAYBE EVEN

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:03.795
OTHER STATES- WHAT'S TO PREVENT

02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:05.297
BAD GUYS FROM CONTINUING THAT

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:07.399
PRACTICE WHILE WE IMPOSE MORE

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:11.103
COSTS ON. OUR LOCAL LAW

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:13.705
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I. E. R.

02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:24.683
R. CITIES- TO DO SOME WHERE WE

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:25.651
ARE KNOW THERE BUT ARE GOING IN

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:26.985
WHERE THEY CAME YOU KNOW WHO

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:27.953
SHOT THEM. WELL SO I GUESS A CO

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:28.887
OF A COUPLE OF RESPOND TO THIS

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:29.454
IN TERMS OF THE ANY I KNOW

02:10:29.521 --> 02:10:31.657
WE'RE NOT IN COULD BY- IF YOU

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:32.291
LOOK AT THE CAR THE ESTá COST

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:33.992
STATE. HERE AND THEN YOU THINK

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:35.260
ABOUT COST OF GUN OF MEDICARE

02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:36.528
AND OTHER THING TO THE STATE.

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:37.329
IF WE PRESENT IF WE PREVENT ONE

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.630
OR TWO SHOOTING HERE WE ARE

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:39.865
PROBABLY THIS IS PROBABLY

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:41.166
REVENUE POSITIVE FOR THE STATE

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:42.334
OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:44.269
SAVING TAXPAYER MONEY. NOW ON

02:10:44.336 --> 02:10:45.871
THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF YOUR

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.372
EITHER THE FIRST PART OF THE

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:49.208
QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:53.045
CRIMINALS OFTEN ACQUIRE LAW-

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:53.645
FIREARMS THROUGH A VARIETY OF

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:54.179
MEANS. IN ANY EVENT WHERE

02:10:54.246 --> 02:10:55.214
THERE'S MY CRISTINA CAN

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.982
ACTUALLY HELP TRACE WHERE THE

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.617
FIRING CAME FROM AND SO THAT'S

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:00.185
WHY. THERE'S AN ELEMENT CARE

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:01.420
PREVENTING GUN TRAFFICKING WITH

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:03.121
RIGHT NOW PEOPLE BUY WEAPONS WE

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:04.223
HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TRACE THEM

02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:06.725
BACK. IF THEY'RE MY CHRISTOPHER

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:09.328
HELPED US TRACE THAT BACK. IF

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:09.861
THEY'RE BUYING THEM FROM A

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.296
FOREIGN COUNTRY. THAT'S NOT

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:12.164
SOMETHING THAT THIS BILL CAN

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.165
ADDRESS THIS BILL ISN'T GONNA

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:14.933
SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM IN IN THE

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.301
ENTIRE WORLD ALL ALL ADMIT THAT

02:11:16.368 --> 02:11:16.969
THERE ARE THINGS THAT THIS BILL

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:19.338
CAN'T DEAL- BUT I THINK IT IT

02:11:19.404 --> 02:11:20.639
WILL ROLL THE BALL FORWARD. ON

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:21.707
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:23.175
PART TO THE STATE THAT WILL

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:23.875
BENEFIT BOTH LAW ABIDING

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:27.279
CITIZENS. AND DAM ON FORSMAN.

02:11:27.346 --> 02:11:28.981
I'M NOT SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:30.716
HOW IT PREVENTS A SHOOTING FROM

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.718
HAPPENING. I UNDERSTAND HOW IT

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:35.153
MAY PREVENT. SOMEBODY WHO HAD

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:36.788
NO INTENTION OF GOING AND BEING

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:38.857
A SHOOTER OF SORTS WHO HAD

02:11:38.924 --> 02:11:42.728
THEIR GUN MAKERS. MICRO

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:44.429
MICROCHIPPED WHATEVER. AND THEN

02:11:44.496 --> 02:11:46.498
GONE OUT AND- AND GET A

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:48.700
SHOOTING. HOW THAT MIGHT HELP

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.602
HEM CATCH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:53.038
SO SERVICE HOW IT PREVENTS

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:53.772
THANK YOU THE IDEA HERE IN

02:11:53.839 --> 02:11:55.073
TERMS IT IS A GREAT QUESTION

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:56.308
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION DID YOU

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:56.842
HEARD FROM THE PREVENTING

02:11:56.908 --> 02:11:59.344
SHOOTING. IS A LOT OF THE GUN

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:00.178
VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.080
STATE IS RETALIATORY VIOLENCE

02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:03.315
WE SEE THIS IN CERTAIN IN

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:04.883
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RIGHT AND

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:06.218
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IN

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:07.452
PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE INVESTED

02:12:07.519 --> 02:12:08.887
HUGE AMOUNT AMOUNTS OF MONEY

02:12:08.954 --> 02:12:09.655
AND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:11.256
PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:12.624
DATA THAT WE CAN BREAK THAT

02:12:12.691 --> 02:12:14.359
CYCLE OF RETALIATORY VIOLENCE

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.494
WE CAN BRING THE OVERALL NUMBER

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.229
OF SHOOTINGS WAY DOWN. AND SO

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:18.830
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT GIVES

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:20.732
LAW ENFORCEMENT A BETTER LEAD

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:22.100
ON WHO COMMITTED A SHOOTING AND

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.635
THEY CAN GET THAT PERSON THEY

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:24.870
CAN BREAK THAT CHAIN OF

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:29.007
RETALIATORY VIOLENCE AND

02:12:29.074 --> 02:12:29.574
HOPEFULLY BRING THE LEVEL OF

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:30.475
GUN VIOLENCE DOWN. THANK YOU

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:34.513
FOR ANSWERS. ARE THANK YOU UP

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:36.048
MR LACKEY A QUESTION YEAH I

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:38.650
JUST A COUPLE POINTS OF CLARITY

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.585
IS IT TRUE THAT- MICROSCOPIC

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.154
TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:43.822
BY ANY HANDGUN MANUFACTURED TO

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:46.558
THIS POINT. THAT THAT'S THAT

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:47.959
THAT'S CORRECT AND THIS IS ONE

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.294
OF THESE AREAS WERE HOPING THAT

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:50.495
THAT TECH THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.830
LEAD I THINK THAT THEY'VE-

02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:53.065
SOUGHT TO EVADE THAT

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.466
REQUIREMENT BUT AS I AS I

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:56.935
MENTIONED I DON'T RECALL- YEAH.

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:57.636
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'RE IN

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:59.371
THE ROOM OR NOT DAVID NEEDED IN

02:12:59.438 --> 02:13:01.340
COURT FILINGS THAT THEY ARE

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:02.607
TECHNICALLY ABLE TO DO THIS BUT

02:13:02.674 --> 02:13:04.242
IT'S NOT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:04.710
FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:06.578
MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY. AND OUR

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:08.914
ATTORNEY GENERAL CERTIFIED IN

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.382
200-010-2000 THIRTEEN THAT

02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:11.249
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IT SO WE

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:12.117
HAVE FROM BOTH THE LAW

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.151
ENFORCEMENT SIDE AND THE

02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:14.686
MANUFACTURER SIDE. THE

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:17.255
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THEY'RE

02:13:17.322 --> 02:13:17.723
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE

02:13:17.789 --> 02:13:20.058
TECHNOLOGY. IT'S MY-

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:23.061
FRUSTRATION THAT- THE WAY THE

02:13:23.128 --> 02:13:23.628
BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:25.697
WRITTEN TO. WILL LIMIT THE

02:13:25.764 --> 02:13:28.667
ABILITY FOR PURCHASING- A LAW

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:30.535
ENFORCEMENT FOR CERTAIN KIND OF

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:32.170
WEAPONS ARE SURE KIND OF

02:13:32.237 --> 02:13:35.474
WEAPONS. THAT MAY NOT BE.

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.142
MANUFACTURED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:39.778
THERE'S NONE. AND WHEN YOU TALK

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:41.313
ABOUT SAVING MONEY WHO WERE YOU

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.414
SAVING MONEY FOR BECAUSE IT'S

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:45.784
MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS

02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:47.219
BILL HAS NO FUNDING MECHANISM.

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:50.188
SO IT'S JUST GOING TO COST LAW

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:52.591
ENFORCEMENT PART OF THE BUDGET.

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.659
YEAH AND I AGAIN I THINK- AND

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:55.794
I'LL JUST ADDRESSED THE DOCTOR

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:57.162
KIRK REYES THE SAME POINT READY

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.263
TO GO TO WE DON'T WANT TO LIMIT

02:13:58.330 --> 02:13:59.097
THE RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT LAW

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:00.999
ENFORCEMENT HAS- WHICH THEY

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.033
NEED THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.836
THEIR JOB. SO IF THERE IS NOT A

02:14:04.903 --> 02:14:06.772
MODEL OF GUN THAT IS SOLD WITH

02:14:06.838 --> 02:14:07.906
MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.174
THEY NEED THEY CAN GO OUT THERE

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:11.143
AND BY THAT CATEGORY OF WEAPON

02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:13.412
AND THEN ENGRAVE THE FIRING TEN

02:14:13.478 --> 02:14:15.313
WITH MY CRISTINA OR REPLACE THE

02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:17.315
FIRING PIN WITH A FIRING PIN

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:18.450
THAT HAS BEEN MICRO STAMP AT A

02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:20.318
COST OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN.

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:22.120
FIFTY CENTS AND SIX FIFTY TO

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:23.755
REPLACE THAT THAT FIRING HIM SO

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:25.157
WE'RE NOT ANYWAY GOING TO LIMIT

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:26.558
ANY TYPE OF CATEGORY OF WEAPON

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:27.959
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD USE

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:28.860
TO DO THEIR JOB THEY NEED THE

02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:30.796
TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND THEN

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:32.264
IN TERMS OF THE COST AYE I

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:33.131
MENTION THIS I THINK WHEN

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:34.633
YOU'RE OUT OF THE ROOM. THE

02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:37.569
LOWEST ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:38.170
THIS TECHNOLOGY PER WEAPON IS

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:40.939
FIFTY CENTS. THE HIGHEST

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:41.506
ESTIMATE IS SIX DOLLARS AND

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:42.674
FIFTY CENTS WHEN YOU TAKE INTO

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:44.476
CONSIDERATION WE HAVE EIGHTY

02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:44.976
SIX THOUSAND ACTIVE LAW

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:45.677
ENFORCEMENT THE STATE OF

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:48.680
CALIFORNIA TOTAL COST STATEWIDE

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:50.048
EVERY OFFICER IS SOMEWHERE

02:14:50.115 --> 02:14:53.185
BETWEEN I GOT TO CHECK MY MATH

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:54.953
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FIVE

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:55.587
HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND FOR THE

02:14:55.654 --> 02:14:56.855
WHOLE STATE EVERY AGENCY EVERY

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:59.057
OFFICER SO. IN MY MIND IF

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:00.225
YOU'RE HALF A MILLION BUCKS IS

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:01.827
YOUR HIGHER ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:03.929
REALLY IMPOSING A HUGE BURDEN

02:15:03.995 --> 02:15:05.096
ON OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:15:05.163 --> 02:15:06.164
AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:06.731
ADDRESS TO THE BUDGET FOR A

02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:08.900
PROBLEMS I WAS HOPING TO SPEAK

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:10.402
TO A POLICY IN THIS COMMITTEE.

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.070
BUT I THINK THIS IDEA OF COST

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.138
AND BURDEN HERE WHEN YOU

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:17.609
ACTUALLY DO THE MATH. IT'S DE

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:18.610
MINIMUS. IN MY OPINION THERE'S

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:21.413
TOO MUCH- FOR SOME THE SOAP. IN

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.081
THE DEFENSE OF- LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:25.016
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:29.020
THE STUDENTS ARE. MR LEE. I

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:30.121

THOROUGHNESS IN THIS ISSUE AREA

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:35.360
ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HOW

02:15:35.427 --> 02:15:36.361
FORWARD THINKING IT IS

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:37.896
OBVIOUSLY THEY JUST RECENTLY TO

02:15:37.963 --> 02:15:38.964
CATCH UP TO THIS BUT IT COULD

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.599
BRING GREAT TRANSPARENCY IN

02:15:40.665 --> 02:15:42.567
ESPECIALLY THE ISSUE OF POLICE

02:15:42.634 --> 02:15:45.003
INVOLVED SHOOTINGS BECAUSE UP

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.304
UNTIL NOW WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:47.606
SHOT WHICH BILL UNTIL THIS

02:15:47.672 --> 02:15:49.374
BALLISTIC TESTS BUT MICROGAMING

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:51.376
WHO CAN TELL CONFIDENCE WHO

FIRED WHAT SHOT AND THAT GIVES

02:15:52.777 --> 02:15:53.578
A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY KNOWS THE

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:54.880
PUBLIC BUT TO THE POLICE FAR

02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:56.281

JUST THIS WEEKEND- IN IN A

SUBURB NORTH OF MINNEAPOLIS AND

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:05.624
IT WOULD BE REALLY BORED TO

ELEVEN NINETY SIX. AND I'M

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:21.699
GONNA MAKE THIS REALLY SHORT

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:33.878
TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:38.349
THIS AMENDMENT- PRETTY MUCH-

02:27:38.416 --> 02:27:39.817
PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:41.919
AGENCIES FROM AUTHORIZING

OF POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. SO THE

02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:51.395
KEY WORD IS SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT-

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:54.198
THE RISK MUST BE SUBSTANTIAL

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:57.134
ABOUT TWO MORE POINTS- AS FAR

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:59.337

02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:00.805
WEIGHT INVOLVED WHEN IT COMES

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:03.074
TO RESTRAINING A SUSPECT. AND

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:05.376
THAT THAT PRESSURE OR THAT BODY

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:06.444
WEIGHT ON THE PERSON WHO'S

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:09.280
RESTRAINT MUST BE ON REASONABLE

02:28:09.347 --> 02:28:11.148
THE KEY WORD IS ON REASONABLE.

02:28:11.215 --> 02:28:13.517

SO I HEAR YOU I JUST WANNA MAKE

02:38:41.111 --> 02:38:44.548

TO CHIME IN THAT THIS QUESTION

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:47.985
OF WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN BE

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:50.954
USED WHERE THERE IS A RISK OF

02:38:51.021 --> 02:38:54.458
DEATH TO THE OFFICER- RIGHT

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:55.259
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

02:38:55.325 --> 02:38:56.660
SHOULD BE USED BUT I GUESS THE

02:38:56.727 --> 02:38:59.496
QUESTION IS- DOES THAT ALLOW

02:38:59.563 --> 02:39:00.764
FOR IT TO BE USED WHEN THERE

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:03.233
IS. WHEN AN OFFICER IS LOST HIS

02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:05.202
OR HER WEAPON RIGHT AND THERE

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:06.403
IS A RISK OF DEATH TO THE

02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:07.871
OFFICER AND THE OFFICER HAS A

02:39:07.938 --> 02:39:09.106
RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES I

02:39:09.172 --> 02:39:11.408
MEAN THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:13.210
THE OFFICER HAS A RIGHT TO

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:15.779
DEFEND HIM OR HERSELF IN THE

02:39:15.846 --> 02:39:17.514
OMISSION OF RESTRAINING AN

02:39:17.581 --> 02:39:19.316
INDIVIDUAL WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:21.518
IN THE ACT EVEN WHEN YOU COME

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:24.288
DOWN TO GEORGE FLOYD- AND HE

02:39:24.354 --> 02:39:24.855
WAS ON THE NECK WHICH

02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:27.457
RESTRICTED HIS. OXYGEN FLOW

02:39:27.524 --> 02:39:28.592
WHICH CAUSING CONSCIOUSNESS

02:39:28.659 --> 02:39:30.427
WITHIN SAID BUT THEN IT COST

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:32.629
HIM TO DIE THE SAME AN ISSUE OF

02:39:32.696 --> 02:39:35.032
MR CAME TO. THE SAME METHOD WAS

02:39:35.098 --> 02:39:36.733
APPLIED THAT CALLS AND

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.368
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN HE LATER

02:39:38.435 --> 02:39:40.771
DIED AS A RESULT OF IT SO THIS

02:39:40.837 --> 02:39:43.206
BILL DOES NOT A LOT DOES NOT

02:39:43.273 --> 02:39:46.043
HINDER A POLICE OFFICER. FROM

02:39:46.109 --> 02:39:49.513
DOING HIS OR HER JOB OR STOP

02:39:49.579 --> 02:39:52.516
THE PERSON FROM DOING BODILY

02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:54.518
HARM TO THE POLICE OFFICER AND

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:57.487
OR TO SOMEONE ELSE. GOT IT OKAY

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:58.889
SO I MEAN I THINK OBVIOUSLY.

02:39:58.956 --> 02:40:01.258
GEORGE ANGELO KANTO ARE

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:02.059
EXAMPLES WHERE THIS WAS

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:04.328
ABSOLUTELY MISUSED AND I THINK

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.329
WE ARE TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS

02:40:05.395 --> 02:40:07.364
TO ENSURE IT ISN'T USED- I

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:09.733
THINK THAT WE JUST NEED TO MAKE

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:10.367
SURE THAT WE DO ALLOW OFFICERS

02:40:10.434 --> 02:40:12.169
WHO. I NEED TO DEFEND

02:40:12.235 --> 02:40:14.071
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE IS-

02:40:14.137 --> 02:40:15.272
TRIED TO THEIR LIFE THE RIGHT

02:40:15.339 --> 02:40:16.306
TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY PUT

02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:17.441
THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY NOT

02:40:17.507 --> 02:40:19.109
THAT WAS NOT THE SITUATION WITH

02:40:19.176 --> 02:40:20.410
EITHER ANGELO PINTO WHO IS

02:40:20.477 --> 02:40:21.411
HANDCUFFED TO THE GROUND AND

02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:23.013
COMPLETELY NOT A FRAT FOR

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:24.414
CHARTER FLIGHTS RIGHT. I'M MORE

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.016
MANY OTHERS AND SO I THINK THAT

02:40:26.083 --> 02:40:27.684
THAT'S WHERE I JUST WANNA MAKE

02:40:27.751 --> 02:40:29.286
SURE THE CHANGES MADE- BUT I

02:40:29.353 --> 02:40:30.354
APPRECIATE THIS AND I LOOK

02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:31.688
FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT AND WE

02:40:31.755 --> 02:40:33.290

OF OFFICERS I DON'T KNOW ONE

02:42:54.231 --> 02:42:56.500
PERSON. I'VE LEAST I'VE NEVER

02:42:56.566 --> 02:42:58.935
SPOKEN TO ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:00.170
THE ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST

02:43:00.237 --> 02:43:01.538
GEORGE WILL AND THAT WAS AN

02:43:01.605 --> 02:43:03.773
OUTRAGE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:08.044
TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT NOW- AND

02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:10.847
THE CATO SITUATION I'D- I CAN'T.

02:43:10.914 --> 02:43:12.249
DO ANYTHING BUT FEEL VERY

02:43:12.315 --> 02:43:13.717
SADDENED THAT IT HAD THE

02:43:13.783 --> 02:43:16.286
OUTCOME IT DID NO ONE WANTS A

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:18.054
DEADLY OUTCOME NO ONE THE PEACE

02:43:18.121 --> 02:43:20.223
OFFICER DOESN'T WANT THAT AND I

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:21.458
KNOW THE VICTIM DOESN'T WANT

02:43:21.525 --> 02:43:26.897
THAT- AND SO. WHAT WHAT SEEMS

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:29.966
TO BE. THE COMMON OCCURRENCE AT

02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:31.868
LEAST IN THE SENTIMENT OF THOSE

02:43:31.935 --> 02:43:34.271
ON THE OUTSIDE IS THAT OFFICERS

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.072
ARE THE AGGRESSORS. AND I WILL

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:39.176
TELL YOU. MAYBE IN SOME

02:43:39.242 --> 02:43:40.577
INSTANCES THEY ARE IF THEY ARE

02:43:40.644 --> 02:43:42.078
THAT'S REGRETTABLE IT'S NOT

02:43:42.145 --> 02:43:44.347
APPROPRIATE. BUT WHAT IS

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:46.550
APPROPRIATE IS THE ABILITY TO

02:43:46.616 --> 02:43:50.020
TRY TO BRING ORDER AND CALL TO

02:43:50.086 --> 02:43:52.389
A VERY VIOLENT SITUATION. AND

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.523
WHEN YOU USE THE TERM

02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:55.959
POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA THE SIX

02:43:56.026 --> 02:43:59.696
YEAR IT GOES WAY BEYOND CHOKING-

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:01.331
I CAN TELL YOU THAT- WHEN YOU

02:44:01.398 --> 02:44:03.066
START WHEN YOU PLAY WITH A

02:44:03.133 --> 02:44:06.236
COMMON- TACTIC THAT HAS TO BE

02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:07.771
USED WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

02:44:07.837 --> 02:44:09.372
THAT'S EXTREMELY VIOLENT. OF

02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:11.007
ANIL THIS HAPPENED TO ME SO

02:44:11.074 --> 02:44:12.876
MANY TIMES WHERE YOU HAVE A

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:15.845
SUSPECT YOU HANDCUFF YOU PLACED

02:44:15.912 --> 02:44:18.148
IN A PATROL CAR AND THEIR SOUL.

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:19.549
ACT UP FOR LACK OF A BETTER

02:44:19.616 --> 02:44:21.184
WORD THE KICK OUT THE WINDOWS

02:44:21.251 --> 02:44:23.253
IN THE PATROL CAR. YOU HAVE TO

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:24.955
TAKE ACTION AND SO WHAT YOU

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.256
HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO PLAY

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:28.258
A LEG RESTRAINT. ALONG WITH THE

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:30.293
HAND RESTRAINT. AND WHAT

02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.362
HAPPENS IN MANY INSTANCES YOU

02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:33.663
HAVE THE SUSPECT NOW THAT

02:44:33.730 --> 02:44:36.032
YOU'RE RESTRAINED. WHAT I

02:44:36.099 --> 02:44:36.833
BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:38.468
RESTRAINT AND YOU PLACE THEM

02:44:38.535 --> 02:44:40.070
BACK IN THE VEHICLE THEY

02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:42.105
CONTINUE TO MOVE ABOUT THEY

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:46.176
CONTINUE TO. TRY TO SHOW THEIR-

02:44:46.243 --> 02:44:46.676
DISAGREEMENT WITH WHAT'S

02:44:46.743 --> 02:44:49.713
HAPPENING AND IN DOING SO

02:44:49.779 --> 02:44:52.148
THEY'LL PUT THEMSELVES IN.

02:44:52.215 --> 02:44:53.516
CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHEN

02:44:53.583 --> 02:44:55.485
THE RESTRAINT THAT WAY THAT

02:44:55.552 --> 02:44:58.088
LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO BREATHE.

02:44:58.154 --> 02:45:00.924
AND YOU HAVE THIS VERY PROBLEM

02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:03.693
IT'S POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA AND

02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:06.563
THAT IS NOT A TACTIC. THAT WAS

02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:09.699
MISUSED BY THE OFFICER- AND I

02:45:09.766 --> 02:45:12.769
DON'T KNOW. WHAT YOUR

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:15.038
SUGGESTION IS FOR AN

02:45:15.105 --> 02:45:16.840
ALTERNATIVE COURSE OF ACTION

02:45:16.906 --> 02:45:19.242

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:21.077
ABLE TO STOP THIS BILL. BUT I

02:45:21.144 --> 02:45:22.212

SITUATIONS- BUT HAVE ALSO BEEN

02:47:20.063 --> 02:47:21.398

WHO ARE RESISTING. AND THAT'S

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:32.742
WHEN WE THAT'S WHEN THESE TYPE

WHATEVER'S IN A LOT OF TIMES IN

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:46.723
IN THE CASES THAT I WERE ON I'M

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:48.858
GOING ON- I MEAN I'VE HAD

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:49.993
PEOPLE THAT WERE HANDCUFFED IN

02:47:50.059 --> 02:47:52.362
THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR. AND

02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:54.063
THEY PULL UP TO THE POLICE

02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:54.664
STATION THEY OPEN THE DOOR AND

02:47:54.731 --> 02:47:56.366
THE GUY'S DEAD. AND THE REASON

02:47:56.433 --> 02:47:58.835
THE GUY'S DAD IS BECAUSE HE'S

02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:01.371

HEROIN- MACINNES HEROIN AND

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:13.483
COCAINE AT THE SAME TIME-

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:15.418
FENTON ALL WASN'T AROUND YET

02:48:15.485 --> 02:48:15.919

02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:20.657
NOWADAYS- D. C. P. A VERY

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:21.991
UNPREDICTABLE DRUG. AND NOT

YOU'VE BEEN ON A GUY WHO HAS

02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:26.496
PC. PC PIANE- I'LL TELL YOU

02:48:26.563 --> 02:48:29.599
PEOPLE WHO ARE FIVE FOOT SIX

02:48:29.666 --> 02:48:30.233
AND WEIGHS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:33.203
POUNDS- WILL TAKE SIX OFFICERS

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:34.771
TO HOLD SOMEBODY DOWN LIKE THAT

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:35.605
AND BY THE TIME THEY'RE DONE

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:37.640
HOLDING THEM DOWN. GUESS WHAT

02:48:37.707 --> 02:48:41.044
THIS POSITIONAL. ASPHYXIA MAY

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:42.879
HAVE OCCURRED- SO IT'S LIKE

02:48:42.946 --> 02:48:44.080
WHAT DO YOU DO I'VE SEEN PEOPLE

02:48:44.147 --> 02:48:45.715
BREAK THEIR ARMS FROM THOSE

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:47.984
THINGS. SO FOR ME YOU KNOW

02:48:48.051 --> 02:48:49.652
WE'RE TAKING AWAY A LOT OF

02:48:49.719 --> 02:48:51.821
TOOLS THE POLICE OFFICERS WIND

02:48:51.888 --> 02:48:52.922
UP USING NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT

02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:54.757
TO. IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:56.659
THEY HAVE TO DO IT TO DEFEND

02:48:56.726 --> 02:48:58.194
THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE AROUND

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:00.463
THEM OR OTHERS AND THAT'S MY

02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:02.065
CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE REALLY

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:04.601
GETTING AWAY FROM- ALLOWING

02:49:04.667 --> 02:49:06.503
POLICE OFFICERS TO TRY TO USE

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:08.938
LESS THAN THAN LETHAL FORCES.

02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:10.640
ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES THE

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:12.542
COMBINATION DOESN'T ALLOW THAT

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:17.347
TO HAPPEN. AND OF DRUG USE AND-

02:49:17.413 --> 02:49:20.083
A RESTRAINT- AND SO YOU KNOW

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:21.551
THAT IT'S THOSE TYPE INCIDENT

02:49:21.618 --> 02:49:23.686
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL

02:49:23.753 --> 02:49:25.889
WITH IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US-

02:49:25.955 --> 02:49:26.823
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:29.192
OFFICERS. AND YOU KNOW IT JUST

02:49:29.259 --> 02:49:30.994
VERY LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:33.463
DIFFICULT FOR. FOR US TO GET A

02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:34.764
GRASP ON WHERE THAT LITTLE

02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:36.065
MIDDLE GROUND IS THAT DOESN'T

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:40.403
TAKE AWAY- THEIR ABILITY TO

02:49:40.470 --> 02:49:41.738
DEFEND THEMSELVES AND DEFEND

02:49:41.804 --> 02:49:43.940
OTHER PEOPLE. AND AT THE SAME

02:49:44.007 --> 02:49:46.676
TIME TRYING TO PROTECT THE

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:48.711
PERSON THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL.

02:49:48.778 --> 02:49:50.747

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:51.981

02:50:06.262 --> 02:50:07.630
OTHER PEOPLE WHO HEAR ABOUT IT

02:50:07.697 --> 02:50:09.465
BUT- HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT.

COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO AS LONG

03:20:59.113 --> 03:21:01.382
AS THEY HAD THE DRIVING-

03:21:01.449 --> 03:21:03.518
MECHANISM UNDERTAKEN WHERE THEY

03:21:03.584 --> 03:21:04.719
ACTUALLY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT

03:21:04.786 --> 03:21:08.089
THEY HAVE DRIVING ABILITY- THIS

03:21:08.156 --> 03:21:09.924
IS JUST A VERY CONFUSING.

03:21:09.991 --> 03:21:11.526
CIRCUMSTANCE AND HOW WOULD AND

03:21:11.592 --> 03:21:13.928
HOW IT ADDRESSES UNDOCUMENTED

03:21:13.995 --> 03:21:15.963
PEOPLE. THAT THAT'S MY THE

03:21:16.030 --> 03:21:17.198
OTHERS ARE VERY CLEAR AND I

03:21:17.265 --> 03:21:19.033
THINK IT'S EVEN NOBLE. BUT THE

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:21.536
REST OF IT THIS LACK OF CARITY

03:21:21.602 --> 03:21:22.470
ON THIS ISSUE MAKES ME VERY

03:21:22.537 --> 03:21:25.406
UNEASY- OKAY I ACTUALLY THINK

03:21:25.473 --> 03:21:26.607
IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD

03:21:26.674 --> 03:21:28.042
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL. WHAT

03:21:28.109 --> 03:21:30.678
SOMEBODY CAN APPLY FOR INSTANCE

03:21:30.745 --> 03:21:32.079
WE'VE EXEMPTED DRIVING TESTS IF

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:34.649
SOMEONE DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE A

03:21:34.715 --> 03:21:36.250
DRIVER'S LICENSE. I DON'T SEE

03:21:36.317 --> 03:21:39.220
DMV IS TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE

03:21:39.287 --> 03:21:39.821
WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE DRIVING

03:21:39.887 --> 03:21:42.690
TEST. WELL SO THERE'S SORT OF

03:21:42.757 --> 03:21:45.693
AN A PRIORITY ISSUE. DO YOU

03:21:45.760 --> 03:21:46.894
HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM

03:21:46.961 --> 03:21:49.263
ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE YES.

03:21:49.330 --> 03:21:50.798
THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT HERE I

03:21:50.865 --> 03:21:52.733
JUST WANT TO THANK MR STONE-

03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:54.202
FOR BRINGING THIS AND YOU KNOW

03:21:54.268 --> 03:21:55.169
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

03:21:55.236 --> 03:21:56.437
THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE STRIVE

03:21:56.504 --> 03:21:57.805
TO DO ALL THE TIME AND WE AS A

03:21:57.872 --> 03:21:58.940
LEGISLATURE IS TO REDUCE

03:21:59.006 --> 03:22:00.341
RECIDIVISM OUR RECIDIVISM RATES

03:22:00.408 --> 03:22:02.043
IN THE STATE ARE WAY TOO HIGH.

03:22:02.109 --> 03:22:04.111
WHICH MEANS YOU KNOW WORSE

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:05.780
OUTCOMES HIGHER COSTS IN OUR

03:22:05.847 --> 03:22:07.582
PRISONS AND MORE CRIME IN OUR

03:22:07.648 --> 03:22:08.950
COMMUNITIES AND I IS SIMPLE

03:22:09.016 --> 03:22:10.117
THINGS LIKE THIS THAT ALLOW

03:22:10.184 --> 03:22:11.152
SOMEONE TO GET BACK ON THEIR

03:22:11.219 --> 03:22:12.687
FEET WHEN THEY LEAVE PRISON.

03:22:12.753 --> 03:22:14.055
AND REENTER THEIR COMMUNITIES

03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:15.189
SUCCESSFULLY AND I THINK THIS

03:22:15.256 --> 03:22:16.290
IS A SMALL MEASURE THAT MAY

03:22:16.357 --> 03:22:18.259
HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE LIVES

03:22:18.326 --> 03:22:18.826
OF THOSE LEAVING OUR SYSTEM

03:22:18.893 --> 03:22:21.095
STUFF TOGETHER SAID AS PART OF

03:22:21.162 --> 03:22:25.333
A NUMBER JUST. CLOSE WITH THIS

03:22:25.399 --> 03:22:26.968

EXCESSIVE REALIGNMENT SURPLUSES

03:39:05.031 --> 03:39:06.132
WHICH THEY COULD SPEND TO

03:39:14.541 --> 03:39:16.176
DECISIONS. THE AUDIT SKI THE

03:39:16.243 --> 03:39:17.978
REPORT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE

03:39:18.044 --> 03:39:19.145
HEART OF THIS BILL IT IS

03:39:19.212 --> 03:39:20.447
INCUMBENT UPON US IS THE

03:39:20.514 --> 03:39:21.815
LEGISLATURE TO BRING FULL

03:39:21.882 --> 03:39:23.750
TRANSPARENCY TO THESE PROGRAMS.

03:39:23.817 --> 03:39:26.186
AND OUR SPENDING WE HAVE SPENT

03:39:26.253 --> 03:39:28.388
OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN

03:39:28.455 --> 03:39:30.023
STATE FUNDS AND WE HAVE VERY

03:39:30.090 --> 03:39:32.058
LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW THAT

03:39:32.125 --> 03:39:34.194
INVESTMENT IS WORKING. THIS

03:39:34.261 --> 03:39:35.562
BILL WILL REQUIRE STANDARDIZED

03:39:35.629 --> 03:39:37.097
LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS AND FIND

03:39:37.163 --> 03:39:39.032
OUT WHERE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL

03:39:39.099 --> 03:39:40.367
WE TALK A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE

03:39:40.433 --> 03:39:41.501
ABOUT MAKING DATA DRIVEN

03:39:41.568 --> 03:39:43.937
DECISIONS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM.

03:39:44.004 --> 03:39:45.171

03:39:45.238 --> 03:39:47.040
DATA NECESSARY TO DO THAT WORK

03:39:47.107 --> 03:39:48.208
SO I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO

03:39:48.275 --> 03:39:49.342
PASS THIS BILL AND GET

03:39:49.409 --> 03:39:50.443

03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:51.645
THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING WHAT'S

03:39:51.711 --> 03:39:53.179
WORKING WHAT ISN'T. SO WE CAN

03:39:53.246 --> 03:39:54.581
EXPAND ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT

03:39:54.648 --> 03:39:56.149
ARE WORKING BECAUSE REDUCING

03:39:56.216 --> 03:39:57.484
RECIDIVISM MEANS BETTER

03:39:57.551 --> 03:39:59.553
OUTCOMES. IT MEANS LESS

03:39:59.619 --> 03:40:00.921
SPENDING IN PRISON DOLLARS AND

03:40:00.987 --> 03:40:02.355
IT ALSO MEANS INCREASED SAFETY

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:04.324

SOMETIMES USING ADVANCES IN

TECHNOLOGY TO DO SO. PROTESTERS

03:55:36.689 --> 03:55:38.157

03:55:38.224 --> 03:55:39.792
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WEARING

03:55:39.859 --> 03:55:40.926

03:55:40.993 --> 03:55:42.895

OF PATIENTS LIVES OUR CURRENT

03:55:56.041 --> 03:55:56.976
LAW DOES NOT REFLECT THE

03:55:57.042 --> 03:55:58.010
SEVERITY OF THIS THREAT BECAUSE

03:55:58.077 --> 03:55:59.845
IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. THE

03:55:59.912 --> 03:56:01.347

MAKING ARRESTS POLICE ARE

03:56:04.683 --> 03:56:05.718
FRUSTRATED BY THE

RELENTLESSNESS OF THESE GROUPS

03:56:07.553 --> 03:56:08.754

MOMENTS THEY'RE BEING ROBBED OF

03:56:23.202 --> 03:56:24.303
THAT RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE AND

03:56:24.370 --> 03:56:25.938
OUR LAWS ARE FAILING TO PROTECT

03:56:26.005 --> 03:56:28.374

TO SAY A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS

04:08:47.045 --> 04:08:49.547
FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT OFTEN

04:08:49.614 --> 04:08:51.549
THAT WE AS A CONSERVATIVE

04:08:51.616 --> 04:08:53.251
LEANING CONSTITUTIONAL GROUP

04:08:53.318 --> 04:08:54.853

WITH THE- ACLU ON A BILL LIKE

04:08:57.188 --> 04:08:58.156
THIS BUT I THINK THAT JUST

04:08:58.223 --> 04:09:00.692
DEMONSTRATES. THE BREADTH AND

04:09:00.759 --> 04:09:02.894
THE DEPTH OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

04:09:02.961 --> 04:09:06.798
THE LEGISLATION- THE- BILL

04:09:06.865 --> 04:09:09.834
LEGISLATION AS NOTED BY THE

04:09:13.772 --> 04:09:15.140

ARGUE ACROSS THE LINE IN A

04:09:17.375 --> 04:09:19.144
NUMBER OF AREAS ONE BEING THE

04:09:19.210 --> 04:09:21.112
PROPER SET UP. AND THAT

04:09:21.179 --> 04:09:22.681
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS

04:09:22.747 --> 04:09:25.150
ATTEMPTED TO DISTINGUISH THAT

04:09:25.216 --> 04:09:27.385
FROM DECISION SUCH AS MCCARTY

04:09:27.452 --> 04:09:30.488
COAKLEY- I THINK THAT ANYBODY

04:09:30.555 --> 04:09:32.457
WHO LOOKS AT THE CURRENT

04:09:32.524 --> 04:09:33.491
MEMBERSHIP OF THE U. S. SUPREME

04:09:33.558 --> 04:09:36.661

04:09:36.728 --> 04:09:37.462
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

04:09:37.529 --> 04:09:40.765
INCLINED TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF

04:09:40.832 --> 04:09:42.734
A SUPER FINE DISTINCTIONS BUT

04:09:42.801 --> 04:09:46.971
AT A MORE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL.

04:09:47.038 --> 04:09:47.972
WHAT THE BILL DIES IS.

04:09:48.039 --> 04:09:50.508
WRESTLING THAT ALL OF THE

04:09:50.575 --> 04:09:52.711
THREATS THE INTIMIDATION THE

04:09:52.777 --> 04:09:54.346
VIOLIN OR A ONE DIRECTIONAL

04:09:54.412 --> 04:09:56.948
THAT THEY'RE ALL DIRECTED. AT

04:09:57.015 --> 04:09:58.783
THE CLINIC STAFF WORKERS

04:09:58.850 --> 04:10:01.486
PATIENTS AND NEVER AT THOSE

04:10:01.553 --> 04:10:05.323
WHO- PRAY AND PLEAD ANNA TIMES

04:10:05.390 --> 04:10:07.792
PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF CLINICS WE

04:10:07.859 --> 04:10:09.294
REPRESENT MANY SUCH

04:10:09.361 --> 04:10:11.396
INDIVIDUALS. THEY CONDEMN

04:10:11.463 --> 04:10:12.831
VIOLENCE THREATS AND

04:10:12.897 --> 04:10:15.867
INTIMIDATION BUT THIS BILL DOES

04:10:15.934 --> 04:10:18.203
NOTHING FOR THEM. I ACTUALLY

04:10:18.269 --> 04:10:19.971
THINK IT MAKES IT BLATANTLY

04:10:20.038 --> 04:10:21.306
VIEWPOINT DISCRIMINATORY AND

04:10:21.373 --> 04:10:24.809
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND LASTLY I

04:10:24.876 --> 04:10:27.479
DO SAY THAT WE OFTEN ADVISE OUR

04:10:27.545 --> 04:10:30.081

04:10:30.148 --> 04:10:32.484
FAIRNESS AND ENSURE THEIR OWN

04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:34.052

04:10:41.893 --> 04:10:44.028
HAASSMENT OR INTIMIDATION BUT

04:10:44.095 --> 04:10:46.064
AND SO THAT- THEY CAN PREVENT

04:10:46.131 --> 04:10:48.166
FALSE ACCUSATIONS. THIS BILL

04:10:48.233 --> 04:10:49.567
WOULD BRING IN THAT KIND OF

04:10:49.634 --> 04:10:52.804
CONDUCT CHANGER IS SOLELY IN TO

THIS PARTICULAR. ASPECT I

BELIEVE THAT THESE PROVISIONS

04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:14.879
EQUATION I FIND IT TO BE

04:13:14.946 --> 04:13:16.247
UNSUPPORTABLE AT THIS POINT

04:13:16.314 --> 04:13:18.049

TO PROTECT EVERYBODY WHO'S

04:13:34.132 --> 04:13:34.899
GOING ABOUT THEIR LAWFUL

04:13:34.966 --> 04:13:36.634
BUSINESS IN SAFETY AND

04:13:36.701 --> 04:13:38.803
SECURITY- WHETHER WE AGREE WITH

04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:41.239
WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR NOT- I

04:13:41.306 --> 04:13:42.774
APOLOGIZE TO THE MAN WHO

04:13:42.840 --> 04:13:43.942
TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION I CAN'T

04:13:44.008 --> 04:13:45.710
REMEMBER I'M YOUR NAME BUT THE

04:13:45.777 --> 04:13:46.844
SECOND GENTLEMAN WHO I THINK

04:13:46.911 --> 04:13:47.645
SPOKE TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

04:13:47.712 --> 04:13:50.915
ABOUT. AND THE LACK OF IT BEING

04:13:50.982 --> 04:13:51.716
YOU POINT NEUTRAL I WOULD ARGUE

04:13:51.783 --> 04:13:54.886
THAT I MEAN JUST IN OUR BODY

04:13:54.953 --> 04:13:56.487
ALONE THERE ARE. DEFINITELY

04:13:56.554 --> 04:13:57.922
WOMEN WHO ARE REPRODUCTIVE

04:13:57.989 --> 04:13:59.023
HEALTH PATIENTS WHO DON'T SHARE

04:13:59.090 --> 04:14:01.326
MY POSITION ON CHOICE. AND THEY

04:14:01.392 --> 04:14:02.360
WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THIS AS

04:14:02.427 --> 04:14:03.928
WELL. AND THERE ARE

04:14:03.995 --> 04:14:05.697
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WORKERS

04:14:05.763 --> 04:14:08.533
WHO. WORK TO PROVIDE

04:14:08.600 --> 04:14:09.834
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES TO

04:14:09.901 --> 04:14:11.202
I BELIEVE DON'T PROVIDE

04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:12.604
ABORTIONS THAT ARE PROTECTED BY

04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:14.305
THIS. SO IN THAT WAY I BELIEVE

04:14:14.372 --> 04:14:15.406
IT IS YOU POINT NEUTRAL WE'RE

04:14:15.473 --> 04:14:16.674
PROTECTING A CERTAIN CLASS OF

04:14:16.741 --> 04:14:18.910
PEOPLE BUT IT IS NOT. FOR US OR

04:14:18.977 --> 04:14:20.478
FOR THE LAW TO SAY WHETHER

04:14:20.545 --> 04:14:22.447
THOSE PEOPLE ARE. ABORTION

04:14:22.513 --> 04:14:23.815
PROVIDERS OR NOT OR WHETHER

04:14:23.881 --> 04:14:25.350
THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE SEEKING

04:14:25.416 --> 04:14:26.684
CARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE

04:14:26.751 --> 04:14:28.786
ARC SEEKING ABORTIONS OR NOT OR

04:14:28.853 --> 04:14:31.222
WHETHER THEY EVER WOULD- AND SO

04:14:31.289 --> 04:14:32.557
I THINK THIS BILL FOCUSES ON A

04:14:32.624 --> 04:14:33.858
CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE

04:14:33.925 --> 04:14:35.293
CURRENTLY BEING THREATENED BUT

04:14:35.360 --> 04:14:37.729
IT BY NO MEANS SPEAKS TO THE

04:14:37.795 --> 04:14:39.297
VIEW POINT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

04:14:39.364 --> 04:14:40.698
AND I WANT THAT TO BE REALLY

04:14:40.765 --> 04:14:42.166
REALLY CLEAR AND I DO BELIEVE.

04:14:42.233 --> 04:14:43.835
AND IT IS YOU POINT NEUTRAL AND

04:14:43.901 --> 04:14:45.136
THAT WAY ALTHOUGH NARROW IN

04:14:45.203 --> 04:14:46.838
SCOPE I DO BELIEVE THAT IT

04:14:46.904 --> 04:14:48.673
FOCUSES. JUST ON WHAT IS

04:14:48.740 --> 04:14:49.874
HAPPENING IN OUR REPRODUCTIVE

04:14:49.941 --> 04:14:53.945
HEALTH SPACE AND THE- COMPLETE-

04:14:54.012 --> 04:14:55.380
DIVISION AND WHERE WE HAVE

04:14:55.446 --> 04:14:57.215
GOTTEN WHO IS A SOCIETY THAT.

04:14:57.281 --> 04:14:59.350
IN THIS BODY I HAVE PEOPLE WHO

04:14:59.417 --> 04:15:00.151
DON'T AGREE WITH ME ON CHOICE

04:15:00.218 --> 04:15:01.953
AND WE HAVE. DIALOGUE ABOUT

04:15:02.020 --> 04:15:03.388
THAT AND I WANT TO ADDRESS WITH

04:15:03.454 --> 04:15:05.156
THE ACLU SAID AS WELL WHICH IS

04:15:05.223 --> 04:15:06.758

04:15:06.824 --> 04:15:08.192
ENSURE THAT CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE

04:15:08.259 --> 04:15:09.193
PROTECTED I BELIEVE IN THE

04:15:09.260 --> 04:15:10.495
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT I BELIEVE

04:15:10.561 --> 04:15:11.295
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO

04:15:11.362 --> 04:15:12.563
EXPRESS THEIR FIRST MEMBER

04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:14.699
RIGHT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY

04:15:14.766 --> 04:15:16.267
HAVE A RIGHT TO CROSS THE LINE

04:15:16.334 --> 04:15:18.770

VIEWPOINT YOU CANNOT CROSS THAT

04:15:25.576 --> 04:15:26.511
LINE IN A MATTER OF YOU POINT

04:15:26.577 --> 04:15:28.112
OF THOSE WERE BEING SUBJECT OF

THREATEN INTIMIDATE AND

04:16:06.117 --> 04:16:07.085
POTENTIALLY CAUSE VIOLENCE

OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING TO

OF TIME ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE

04:16:14.759 --> 04:16:15.960
TRYING TO MAKE THIS VERY TOUGH

04:16:16.027 --> 04:16:17.929
DECISION AS I HAVE MADE IN MY

04:16:17.995 --> 04:16:19.864
LIFE. WHEN YOU ESPECIALLY

04:16:19.931 --> 04:16:21.432
SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO THAT

04:16:21.499 --> 04:16:22.200
TYPE OF INTIMIDATION OR THREAT

04:16:22.266 --> 04:16:24.769

04:16:27.872 --> 04:16:29.340
THEY I BELIEVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL

04:16:29.407 --> 04:16:32.643
HUMAN RIGHT. IN A SAFE PLACE.

04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:34.112
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

04:16:34.178 --> 04:16:36.280
OF THAT DECISION AND FOR THEIR

04:16:36.347 --> 04:16:37.915
IMAGES NOT TO BE. PUBLISHED ON

04:16:37.982 --> 04:16:39.250
THE INTERNET WHEN THEY'RE

04:16:39.317 --> 04:16:41.052
MAKING A VERY PRIVATE DECISION-

04:16:41.119 --> 04:16:42.153
AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE

04:16:42.220 --> 04:16:43.521
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

04:16:43.588 --> 04:16:44.322
THINK THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED

04:16:44.388 --> 04:16:46.390
VERY HARD. TO ADDRESS SOME OF

04:16:46.457 --> 04:16:48.025
THE CONCERNS. THAT THE

04:16:48.092 --> 04:16:49.327
OPPOSITION IS RACE AND I WILL

04:16:49.393 --> 04:16:51.062
TELL YOU I OFTEN VOTE WITH THE

04:16:51.129 --> 04:16:52.864
OPPOSITION. IF YOU LOOK AT MY

04:16:52.930 --> 04:16:54.932
VOTING RECORD I'VE RARELY VOTE

04:16:54.999 --> 04:16:56.667
TO INCREASE PENALTIES BUT I

04:16:56.734 --> 04:16:57.935
THINK WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT

04:16:58.002 --> 04:16:59.370
MODERNIZES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN

04:16:59.437 --> 04:17:01.172
REAL LIFE. IN OUR REPRODUCTIVE

04:17:01.239 --> 04:17:04.809
HEALTH- CARE FACILITIES- AND SO

04:17:04.876 --> 04:17:06.544
AND I AND I ALSO TRUST THE

04:17:06.611 --> 04:17:07.879
AUTHOR TO CONTINUE THOSE

04:17:07.945 --> 04:17:08.913
CONVERSATIONS I KNOW THAT SHE

04:17:08.980 --> 04:17:12.216
WILL- AND SO IS WITH THAT

04:17:12.283 --> 04:17:12.784
REASON I WILL BE VOTING FOR

04:17:12.850 --> 04:17:15.019
THIS BILL TODAY. I I'M OF THE

04:17:15.086 --> 04:17:18.156

THE WHOLE COMMITTEES ENGAGEMENT

04:17:26.097 --> 04:17:27.598
ON THIS SUBJECT I KNOW THE

04:17:27.665 --> 04:17:28.833
RAISING PENALTIES ISN'T AN EASY

04:17:28.900 --> 04:17:30.368
THING FOR MANY PEOPLE ON THIS

04:17:30.434 --> 04:17:32.270
COMMITTEE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT

04:17:32.336 --> 04:17:33.604
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH

04:17:33.671 --> 04:17:34.739
ME ALWAYS ON CHOICE OF WORKS

04:17:34.806 --> 04:17:36.274
HARD TO CONSIDER WHETHER THIS

04:17:36.340 --> 04:17:36.908
IS SOMETHING THAT'S A PART OF

04:17:36.974 --> 04:17:38.476
AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT.

04:17:38.543 --> 04:17:41.112
YOU KNOW I TRULY APPRECIATE THE

04:17:41.179 --> 04:17:42.346
OPEN DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE THE

04:17:42.413 --> 04:17:44.282
COMMITTEE ON WHERE WE CAN FIND

04:17:44.348 --> 04:17:45.216
COMMON GROUND WHETHER BE

04:17:45.283 --> 04:17:46.617
SOMEONE WHO RARELY SUPPORTS

04:17:46.684 --> 04:17:47.885
REYES PENALTIES OR SOMEONE WHO

04:17:47.952 --> 04:17:50.421
REALLY SUPPORTS ANTIQUES THE

04:17:50.488 --> 04:17:51.556
PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO

04:17:51.622 --> 04:17:54.325
CHOOSE- AND BUT I JUST REALLY

04:17:54.392 --> 04:17:56.260
WANT TO FOCUS ON THESE WOMEN.

04:17:56.327 --> 04:17:57.895
AND WORKERS WHETHER THEY BE MEN

04:17:57.962 --> 04:17:58.763
OR WOMEN ALTHOUGH THE VAST

04:17:58.830 --> 04:18:00.498
MAJORITY ARE PROBABLY WOMEN WHO

04:18:00.565 --> 04:18:03.201
WALK INTO THESE CLINICS- TO GET

04:18:03.267 --> 04:18:05.102
HEALTH CARE AND SOMETIMES IT'S

04:18:05.169 --> 04:18:06.070
FOR ABORTION AND SOMETIMES IT'S

04:18:06.137 --> 04:18:07.305
FOR CANCER SCREENINGS OR OTHER

04:18:07.371 --> 04:18:08.306
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THAT

04:18:08.372 --> 04:18:10.408
WE ALL AGREE IS NECESSARY AND

04:18:10.474 --> 04:18:12.076
IN SO DOING THEY ARE THREATENS

04:18:12.143 --> 04:18:13.811
WE HAVE LAWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

04:18:13.878 --> 04:18:14.679
AND NATIONALLY TO PROTECT OUR

04:18:14.745 --> 04:18:16.314
PRIVACY RUN HEALTHCARE THE DAY

04:18:16.380 --> 04:18:17.515
WHEN I GO INTO THE DOCTOR

04:18:17.582 --> 04:18:18.449
NOBODY GETS TO KNOW WHAT

04:18:18.516 --> 04:18:19.584
HAPPENS IN THAT ROOM AND YET

04:18:19.650 --> 04:18:21.319
PEOPLE ARE FILMING. THESE WOMEN

04:18:21.385 --> 04:18:22.753
IN PUTTING THAT ON THE INTERNET

04:18:22.820 --> 04:18:23.955
AND VIOLATING THOSE LAWS THAT

04:18:24.021 --> 04:18:25.890
WE HAVE ALL SUPPORTED I BELIEVE

04:18:25.957 --> 04:18:26.891

04:18:26.958 --> 04:18:29.026
PATIENTS- AND THAT IS WHAT

04:18:29.093 --> 04:18:30.428
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS

04:18:30.494 --> 04:18:31.562
PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:18:31.629 --> 04:18:33.164
GETTING HEALTH CARE AND

04:18:33.231 --> 04:18:34.465
PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

04:18:34.532 --> 04:18:36.334
ABOUT LAW ABIDING ACTIVITIES

04:18:36.400 --> 04:18:37.702
ENSURING THEY CAN DO SO IN

04:18:37.768 --> 04:18:39.804
SAFETY AND SECURITY AND I

04:18:39.871 --> 04:18:43.007

04:18:47.178 --> 04:18:48.112
SPACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE

04:18:48.179 --> 04:18:50.147
PROTESTERS WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO

04:18:50.214 --> 04:18:52.116
PROTEST IN THE WAY THAT OUR

04:18:52.183 --> 04:18:53.551

DESERVE IN THE WAY THEY DESERVE

04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.956
AND I THINK BOTH CAN HAPPEN

04:18:59.023 --> 04:19:01.092
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT THE

04:19:01.158 --> 04:19:01.626

WE INCREASE THE PENALTIES ON

04:20:04.689 --> 04:20:06.557
THE EVE REPRODUCTIVE AGENCIES

04:20:06.624 --> 04:20:07.825

HAD YOUR BUFFER ZONES THAT YOU

04:20:09.593 --> 04:20:11.429
KEEP YOUR PEOPLE SAFE AND MOST

04:20:11.495 --> 04:20:13.631

CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY IS THE

04:20:20.705 --> 04:20:22.306
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT. AND

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT. IT IS

04:20:40.791 --> 04:20:42.827
NOT UP. IT REALLY IS NOT UP TO

04:20:42.893 --> 04:20:44.195

04:21:39.417 --> 04:21:42.353
HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT DEALS WITH.

04:21:42.420 --> 04:21:45.623

04:41:41.618 --> 04:41:45.555
TREATMENT AS A INEFFECTIVE AND

04:41:45.622 --> 04:41:47.624
MY OBSERVATIONS OF MY LIFE

04:41:47.690 --> 04:41:49.592
EXPERIENCE SAY JUST THE

04:41:49.659 --> 04:41:51.427
OPPOSITE THAT- I KNOW VERY FEW

04:41:51.494 --> 04:41:53.930
PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

04:41:53.997 --> 04:41:54.697
BEATEN ADDICTION THE WORK

04:41:54.764 --> 04:41:58.001
PUSHED AND PUSHED VERY HARD. TO

04:41:58.067 --> 04:42:01.604
THE POINT OF DISCOMFORT. AND I

04:42:01.671 --> 04:42:03.906
KNOW THAT THOUGH WHEN. A LOT OF

04:42:03.973 --> 04:42:06.442
THIS THE PROVISIONS. THAT THE

04:42:06.509 --> 04:42:08.745
DIVERSION OFFERED. AND MANY

04:42:08.811 --> 04:42:10.580
OTHER ARREST SITUATIONS THAT I

04:42:10.647 --> 04:42:14.083
OBSERVED- THEY TOOK AWAY. THE

04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:17.086
MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT AND

04:42:17.153 --> 04:42:18.588
WHEN THEY DID THAT THE

04:42:18.655 --> 04:42:20.623
DIVERSION PARTICIPATION FELL

04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:22.625
OFF PRECIPITOUSLY. AND

04:42:22.692 --> 04:42:24.260
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT LED

04:42:24.327 --> 04:42:27.964
TO- TREATMENT. THAT NEVER TOOK

04:42:28.031 --> 04:42:30.533
PLACE SO I- I HAVE SOME

04:42:30.600 --> 04:42:32.702
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I

04:42:32.769 --> 04:42:34.404
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE

04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:37.340
I BELIEVE THAT. IT FILLS A GAP

04:42:37.407 --> 04:42:40.677
THAT IS VERY VERY CLEAR. THE WE

04:42:40.743 --> 04:42:43.279
NEED A REMEDY AND WHEN YOU

04:42:43.346 --> 04:42:46.249

BE STUDIED TO BE OBSERVED LET'S

04:42:48.217 --> 04:42:50.453
SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK

04:42:50.520 --> 04:42:52.955
THAT IT'S GONNA PROVE IF IT'S

04:42:53.022 --> 04:42:54.290
CARRIED OUT. OF THE WAY I

04:42:54.357 --> 04:42:56.759
UNDERSTAND IT. SOME LIVES ARE

04:42:56.826 --> 04:42:58.928
GOING TO BE FIXED. AND I THINK

04:42:58.995 --> 04:43:01.331
THAT THE- THAT'S POWERFULLY

04:43:01.397 --> 04:43:02.999
IMPORTANT I THINK YOU WILL BE

04:43:03.066 --> 04:43:03.800
ABLE TO LEARN FROM THIS

04:43:03.866 --> 04:43:05.368
PROVISION AND- I'M HAPPY TO

THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW MR MCCARTY.

04:43:19.382 --> 04:43:20.883
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT'S WHY

04:43:20.950 --> 04:43:21.918
WE'RE ATTEMPTING HERE

04:43:21.984 --> 04:43:23.386
CALIFORNIA'S A PILOT AS OPPOSED

04:43:23.453 --> 04:43:25.121
TO A STATEWIDE AFTER I DID

04:43:25.188 --> 04:43:26.889
ATTEMPT TO COME UP WITH A BILL

04:43:26.956 --> 04:43:28.725
TWO YEARS AGO LOOKING THE SAME

04:43:28.791 --> 04:43:31.094
IDEA. STATEWIDE REVIEW THE

04:43:31.160 --> 04:43:32.695
BETTER OFF TO START SMALLER

04:43:32.762 --> 04:43:35.832
SMALL COUNTY LIKE YOLO WITH-

04:43:35.898 --> 04:43:37.767
STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE LOCAL

04:43:37.834 --> 04:43:38.701
GOVERNMENT THE DA WHO WANT TO

04:43:38.768 --> 04:43:42.839
PURSUE IT. OKAY AND I'M TO THE

04:43:42.905 --> 04:43:45.308
OPPOSITION- IS IT YOUR VIEW

04:43:45.375 --> 04:43:47.043
THAT GOING INTO FORCED

04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:48.778
TREATMENT I KNOW YOU FALL IT

04:43:48.845 --> 04:43:49.812
WOULD BE VOLUNTARILY MAKING

04:43:49.879 --> 04:43:50.913
THAT CHOICE BUT IT WOULD BE

04:43:50.980 --> 04:43:53.182
SORT OF. I GUESS ENTER THE

04:43:53.249 --> 04:43:54.150
TERMS YOU ALL USE LOCKS

04:43:54.217 --> 04:43:56.953
TREATMENT. IS THAT WORSE THAN

04:43:57.019 --> 04:43:58.654
NO TREATMENT AND- AN

04:43:58.721 --> 04:44:09.399
INSTITUTION. ANYONE OPPOSITION

04:44:09.465 --> 04:44:14.470
WANNA AND. HAPPY TO- ACTUALLY

04:44:14.537 --> 04:44:16.272
ARE AT CAN CANCER AT THAT THE

04:44:16.339 --> 04:44:18.941
QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT-

04:44:19.008 --> 04:44:21.544
FORCE TREATMENT MAY HAPPEN

04:44:21.611 --> 04:44:23.746
THERE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF

04:44:23.813 --> 04:44:26.749
THE UNINTENDED- OUTCOME OF THE

04:44:26.816 --> 04:44:28.418
RAISING THE RISK OF OVERDOSE

04:44:28.484 --> 04:44:30.253
AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN OUR

04:44:30.319 --> 04:44:34.557
PERSPECTIVE- GOTTEN RID OF FOR

04:44:34.624 --> 04:44:35.992
THE INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE AN

04:44:36.058 --> 04:44:37.427
OVERDOSE AND PASSED AWAY FROM

04:44:37.493 --> 04:44:40.329
AN OVERDOSE IT'S A GREATER.

04:44:40.396 --> 04:44:42.064
THAN HAVING NO TREATMENT AT ALL

04:44:42.131 --> 04:44:44.233
IT BY WILL BE EFFORT SHOULD BE

04:44:44.300 --> 04:44:46.702
MADE TO ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE IN

04:44:46.769 --> 04:44:48.404
COMBAT A PERSON AS MANY TIMES

04:44:48.471 --> 04:44:50.306
AS POSSIBLE TO BRING THEM INTO

04:44:50.373 --> 04:44:51.941
VOLUNTARY SERVICE THAT IF

04:44:52.008 --> 04:44:53.142
THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED TO BE

04:44:53.209 --> 04:44:55.144
INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICE THAT AND

04:44:55.211 --> 04:44:56.179
THE TREATMENT IS NOT GOING TO

04:44:56.245 --> 04:44:57.513
BE AFFECTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL

04:44:57.580 --> 04:45:00.216
BUT WHEN THEY STILL BE AT RISK

04:45:00.283 --> 04:45:07.156
COMING OUT OF JAIL OR PRISON.

04:45:07.223 --> 04:45:12.829
OF THE SAME OVERDOSE RISK. NOW

04:45:12.895 --> 04:45:15.798
TO THE OPPOSITION I SORRY

04:45:15.865 --> 04:45:18.501
RESTRUCTURING ANSWERED THEY DID

04:45:18.568 --> 04:45:21.871
IT THE OPPOSITION DID YOU

04:45:21.938 --> 04:45:22.405
EITHER ONE OF YOU WANT TO

04:45:22.472 --> 04:45:27.910
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. MMHM

04:45:27.977 --> 04:45:32.315
OKAY- OKAY. AND THEN I. CAN GOT

04:45:32.381 --> 04:45:33.449
SOME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION

04:45:33.516 --> 04:45:34.884
THIS IS JOHN RIFLING FROM HUMAN

04:45:34.951 --> 04:45:37.753
RIGHTS WATCH ON NO I'M NOT A

04:45:37.820 --> 04:45:39.322
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS BUT I

04:45:39.388 --> 04:45:41.524
HAVE. OTHER GREAT UNDERSTANDING

04:45:41.591 --> 04:45:44.060
OF THE- THE SYSTEM IN JAIL SO

04:45:44.126 --> 04:45:47.597
THAT CERTAINLY PEOPLE. COMING

04:45:47.663 --> 04:45:50.333
OUT OF ON. YEAH OF. MAYBE AT

04:45:50.399 --> 04:45:52.001
RISK AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY

04:45:52.068 --> 04:45:53.603
BOLSTER UP BOTH TREATMENT

04:45:53.669 --> 04:45:55.204
PROGRAMS WITHIN THE JAILS AND

04:45:55.271 --> 04:45:56.772
PRISONS BUT ALSO TREATMENT

04:45:56.839 --> 04:45:58.908
OPTIONS. THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF

04:45:58.975 --> 04:46:00.309
AND NOT CONNECTED TO THE

04:46:00.376 --> 04:46:02.712
CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM- IT

04:46:02.778 --> 04:46:05.348
FORCING PEOPLE INTO- INTO

04:46:05.414 --> 04:46:07.149
TREATMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE

04:46:07.216 --> 04:46:07.984
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S

04:46:08.050 --> 04:46:10.186
CRIMINALIZING THE TREATMENT

04:46:10.253 --> 04:46:13.289
SYSTEM. SO I MEAN I AGREE WE

04:46:13.356 --> 04:46:15.358
NEED TO BOLSTER UP TREATMENT

04:46:15.424 --> 04:46:16.359
FOR THE FOLKS ARE COMING UP BUT

04:46:16.425 --> 04:46:17.760
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS

04:46:17.827 --> 04:46:19.896
BILL IS AIMING TO DO AND- IT IS

04:46:19.962 --> 04:46:21.797
A STRANGE DAY WHEN I'M- VOTING

04:46:21.864 --> 04:46:22.932
AGAINST THE OPPOSITION ON THIS

04:46:22.999 --> 04:46:24.267
BILL BUT I DO THINK I'M IN A

04:46:24.333 --> 04:46:25.735
VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND SEE IT

04:46:25.801 --> 04:46:27.436
MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I ALSO.

04:46:27.503 --> 04:46:29.071
THINK THE STATUS QUO ISN'T

04:46:29.138 --> 04:46:30.339
WORKING I THINK THE BILL HAS

04:46:30.406 --> 04:46:32.942
ISSUES I DO SHARE SOME OF THE

04:46:33.009 --> 04:46:34.744
CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION. BUT I

04:46:34.810 --> 04:46:37.613
ALSO TRUST THAT THIS AUTHOR AND

04:46:37.680 --> 04:46:38.781
I'VE SEEN HIS WORK OVER THE

04:46:38.848 --> 04:46:39.882
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IS

04:46:39.949 --> 04:46:40.883
GOING AND WITH REALLY GOOD

04:46:40.950 --> 04:46:42.718
INTENT. AND WE'LL WORK THROUGH

04:46:42.785 --> 04:46:45.087
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- AND I DO

04:46:45.154 --> 04:46:46.923
BELIEVE HIS VALUES ARE SIMILAR

04:46:46.989 --> 04:46:48.391
TO THOSE OF. OF THE OPPOSITION

04:46:48.457 --> 04:46:49.525
TRYING TO HELP AND FIND

04:46:49.592 --> 04:46:50.092
ALTERNATIVES AND FIGURE OUT

04:46:50.159 --> 04:46:52.061
OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN- SOLVE

04:46:52.128 --> 04:46:53.896
SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS SO- MR

04:46:53.963 --> 04:46:55.231
MCCARTY I WILL BE SUPPORTING

04:46:55.298 --> 04:46:57.133
YOUR BILL TODAY. I HOPE TO SEE

04:46:57.199 --> 04:46:58.301
IT GET FIXED THERE ARE SOME

04:46:58.367 --> 04:47:00.536
THINGS I THINK ARE HAVE ISSUES-

04:47:00.603 --> 04:47:02.104
BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD

04:47:02.171 --> 04:47:02.638
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

04:47:02.705 --> 04:47:04.941
MOVING FORWARD. MISTER CORK

04:47:05.007 --> 04:47:07.410
CAP. SO WE'VE TALKED A BIT

04:47:07.476 --> 04:47:09.312
ABOUT THIS. BUT YOU DID NOT

04:47:09.378 --> 04:47:10.780
MENTION OR PERHAPS I JUST

04:47:10.846 --> 04:47:12.081
DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING IN YOUR

04:47:12.148 --> 04:47:14.417
OPENING ABOUT CHANGES THAT YOU

04:47:14.483 --> 04:47:15.451
WERE WILLING TO MAKE IN THE

04:47:15.518 --> 04:47:17.587
BILL. AND WHERE YOU WOULD BE

04:47:17.653 --> 04:47:19.188
GOING WITH THEM DO YOU WANT TO

04:47:19.255 --> 04:47:22.024
ADDRESS THAT. YEAH AT THAT

04:47:22.091 --> 04:47:22.758
FIRST OF ALL I REALLY

04:47:22.825 --> 04:47:24.927
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION

04:47:24.994 --> 04:47:25.962
SOMETIMES IT TAKES AN

04:47:26.028 --> 04:47:27.763
UNCOMFORTABLE SOLUTION TO DEAL

04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:29.432
WITH THOSE. SERIOUS PROBLEMS WE

04:47:29.498 --> 04:47:30.933
HAVE AND SO THIS IS ONE WHERE.

04:47:31.000 --> 04:47:33.402
YOU THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX- I'M

04:47:33.469 --> 04:47:34.370
VERY MINDFUL ABOUT THE

04:47:34.437 --> 04:47:36.572
VOLUNTARY VERSUS COERCION. I

04:47:36.639 --> 04:47:38.908
THINK THIS IS VOLUNTARY SELECT

04:47:38.975 --> 04:47:40.876
SOMEONE'S CHOOSING TO GO HERE-

04:47:40.943 --> 04:47:42.778
HANG OUT IN THEIR LIVING ROOM.

04:47:42.845 --> 04:47:44.113
IF THERE DON'T GO HERE TO THIS

04:47:44.180 --> 04:47:45.848
TREATMENT FACILITY THEY GO TO

04:47:45.915 --> 04:47:47.617
JAIL OR PRISON SO IT'S NOT

04:47:47.683 --> 04:47:48.918
LIKE. THERE'S NO THIRD CHOICE

04:47:48.985 --> 04:47:51.287
HERE. BUT ONE THING THAT. I

04:47:51.354 --> 04:47:52.655
WITH MINDFUL OF AFTER TALKING

THE DRUG MOTIVATED CRIME AND

04:48:02.798 --> 04:48:03.833
GIVING THE THAT THE

04:48:03.899 --> 04:48:05.401
PARTICIPANTS THE OPTION OF

04:48:05.468 --> 04:48:07.336
INCARCERATION OR TREATMENT.

04:48:07.403 --> 04:48:09.005
THEY SAY OKAY FINE I'LL DO THIS

04:48:09.071 --> 04:48:10.373
TREATMENT MAYBE IT WAS A

04:48:10.439 --> 04:48:12.208
CONTROLLED OR I'M NOT YOU KNOW

04:48:12.274 --> 04:48:14.210
MAYBE THEY WERE. ENTICED TO DO

04:48:14.276 --> 04:48:15.845

WHATEVER HAVE YOU. SO. ONE

04:48:21.217 --> 04:48:21.717
THING I TALK TO THAT TO OUR

04:48:21.784 --> 04:48:22.585
LOCAL DA ABOUT TO. IN THE PIE.

04:48:22.652 --> 04:48:23.185
AS WE WOULD GIVE THE PARTIES.

04:48:23.252 --> 04:48:24.720
ENOUGH CHANCE AN OPT. IN THE

04:48:24.787 --> 04:48:25.588
FIRST FEW DAYS OF THEIR

04:48:25.655 --> 04:48:27.490
TREATMENT. IF THEY SAY YOU KNOW

04:48:27.556 --> 04:48:29.659
WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS. FIND

04:48:29.725 --> 04:48:31.360
THE EXIT WE'RE NOT FORCING THEM

04:48:31.427 --> 04:48:32.728
AGAIN BUT AGAIN THEY'RE NOT

04:48:32.795 --> 04:48:34.196
GOING HOMES IT'S HANGING OUT.

04:48:34.263 --> 04:48:35.965
WATCHING THEIR- TV WITH THE

04:48:36.032 --> 04:48:37.099
ANKLE BRACELET. THEY'RE GOING

04:48:37.166 --> 04:48:38.467

04:48:38.534 --> 04:48:39.969
THERE'S A CHOICE TO MAKE BUT WE

04:48:40.036 --> 04:48:41.570
WILL. GIVE THE PERSON ANOTHER

04:48:41.637 --> 04:48:43.539
CHOICE THAT I THINK. IS ANOTHER

04:48:43.606 --> 04:48:45.708
FAIROFFRAMP FOR INDIVIDUALS

04:48:45.775 --> 04:48:47.877
WHO WERE MAYBE. IN THE HEAT OF

04:48:47.943 --> 04:48:49.478
THE PASSING OF COURSE IN THE IN

04:48:49.545 --> 04:48:50.046
THE COURT SYSTEM TO CHOOSE

04:48:50.112 --> 04:48:51.714
THIS. BILL AB ONE MORE CHOICE

04:48:51.781 --> 04:48:53.616
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH

04:48:53.683 --> 04:48:55.518
AND THAT DOESN'T I THINK ANSWER

04:48:55.584 --> 04:48:57.386
THE OBJECTIONS OF THE

04:48:57.453 --> 04:49:03.459
OPPOSITION. FOR MY OWN- AND-

04:49:03.526 --> 04:49:06.028
AGAIN IT'S- FIVE I JUST DON'T

04:49:06.095 --> 04:49:07.663
THINK THIS WILL WORK. AND

AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THIS

04:52:08.244 --> 04:52:10.379
CLEARLY AND I AGREED SOME OF.

04:52:10.446 --> 04:52:11.113
OUR COLLEAGUES HEAR THE STATUS

04:52:11.180 --> 04:52:13.115
QUO IS NOT WORKING OF COURSE

04:52:13.182 --> 04:52:16.385
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IS THE

04:52:16.452 --> 04:52:18.354
INVOLUNTARILY GO AND SEE CREATE

04:52:18.420 --> 04:52:19.922
REAL BILL TO REBUILDING

04:52:19.989 --> 04:52:20.689
SERVICES FOR THE DRUG

04:52:20.756 --> 04:52:23.259
ADDICTION. BUT THAT IS IN THE

04:52:23.325 --> 04:52:24.193
PERFECT CHOICE SETTING IN THIS

04:52:24.260 --> 04:52:26.428
SETTING THEY WERE CHOOSING

04:52:26.495 --> 04:52:27.463
ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN GOING TO

04:52:27.529 --> 04:52:30.099
PRISON OR PERHAPS THIS PROGRAM

04:52:30.165 --> 04:52:31.634
WHICH OF COURSE ITSELF IN IT IF

04:52:31.700 --> 04:52:33.102
ITSELF IS NOT A PERFECT CHOICE

04:52:33.168 --> 04:52:34.770
BUT IT IS A CHOICE IN A WAY.

04:52:34.837 --> 04:52:37.139
AND I DO BELIEVE- HAVING THAT

04:52:37.206 --> 04:52:38.007
CHOICE IS IMPORTANT AND SEE HOW

04:52:38.073 --> 04:52:39.808
IT PLAYS OUT- I ALSO DO LIKE

04:52:39.875 --> 04:52:41.243
THAT IN THE BILL YOU YOU DO

04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:43.212
INCLUDE RIGHT NOW HAVING THE-

04:52:43.279 --> 04:52:44.213
DEALT THE YELLOW COUNTY HEALTH

04:52:44.280 --> 04:52:45.214
AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY

04:52:45.281 --> 04:52:46.615
PERFORMING RISK ASSESSMENTS AND

04:52:46.682 --> 04:52:47.816
WORKING CLASS RELEASE I HOPE

04:52:47.883 --> 04:52:49.718
THERE WILL BE MORE. EMPHASIS ON

04:52:49.785 --> 04:52:51.253
THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD

04:52:51.320 --> 04:52:52.488
OBVIOUS WE DEFINITELY DON'T

04:52:52.554 --> 04:52:54.223
WANT AS MANY OF OPPOSITION I

04:52:54.290 --> 04:52:57.826
STRUGGLE THIS IS TO WRITE WE

04:52:57.893 --> 04:52:59.528
DON'T WANT- WE DON'T WANT TO.

04:52:59.595 --> 04:53:01.063
TRY TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE TO

04:53:01.130 --> 04:53:02.798
INCARCERATION AND PUTTING IT IN

04:53:02.865 --> 04:53:04.333
THE SAME SYSTEM JUST. GIVING IT

04:53:04.400 --> 04:53:05.501
A NEW NAME I THINK THAT'S WHAT

04:53:05.567 --> 04:53:07.102
SOME CONSTERNATION COMES FROM.

04:53:07.169 --> 04:53:08.070
AND I UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY

04:53:08.137 --> 04:53:10.139
HAVING THE FACILITY. IS IT

04:53:10.205 --> 04:53:11.273
CONVENIENT BUT I KNOW THAT SOME

04:53:11.340 --> 04:53:12.308
PEOPLE COULD BE ALARMING TO

04:53:12.374 --> 04:53:13.375
JUST BE REUSING YOUR

04:53:13.442 --> 04:53:15.511
FACILITIES. BUT I THINK IN OUR

04:53:15.577 --> 04:53:16.145
UNCOMFORTABLE PERHAPS

04:53:16.211 --> 04:53:17.680
CONVERSATION ABOUT REIMAGINING

04:53:17.746 --> 04:53:19.515
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY INSTITUTIONS.

04:53:19.581 --> 04:53:20.716
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A PLUS THAT

04:53:20.783 --> 04:53:21.884
WAS A REPURPOSE THESE BUILDINGS

04:53:21.951 --> 04:53:23.652
ARE REPURPOSED THINGS. AND I

04:53:23.719 --> 04:53:25.287
THINK SAID- AS A LEVER CORKS

04:53:25.354 --> 04:53:26.221
POINT IS TO MAKE SURE THE

04:53:26.288 --> 04:53:28.290
STAFFING ISN'T WITH. JUST RE

04:53:28.357 --> 04:53:30.092
PURPOSING- THE SAME OLD SYSTEM

04:53:30.159 --> 04:53:32.428
OF A PRISON AND JAIL- SO I'LL

04:53:32.494 --> 04:53:33.429
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

04:53:33.495 --> 04:53:36.365
TODAY BY DO HO GOING FORWARD IT

04:53:36.432 --> 04:53:38.367
IS MUCH MUCH MORE- GROUNDED IN

04:53:38.434 --> 04:53:39.568
EVERY THOUGHT OF SENSE AND

04:53:39.635 --> 04:53:40.769
SPIRIT OF DIVERSION AND ALSO

04:53:40.836 --> 04:53:42.705
MORE- FOCUS ON ON THE MEDICAL

04:53:42.771 --> 04:53:44.340
TREATMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU

04:53:44.406 --> 04:53:46.675
THANK YOU MISTER SINISTER. IT

04:53:46.742 --> 04:53:48.477
APPEARS TO ME THAT THE CURRENT

04:53:48.544 --> 04:53:50.946
SYSTEM IS. SOMEBODY WHO COMMITS

04:53:51.013 --> 04:53:52.014
THEIR PETTY CRIME TO GO TO

04:53:52.081 --> 04:53:54.917
JAIL- THEY SERVE FOR A- COUPLE

04:53:54.984 --> 04:53:56.585
WEEKS THEY GET OUT THEY TAKE

04:53:56.652 --> 04:53:57.987
THEIR DRUGS THEY COMMIT ANOTHER

04:53:58.053 --> 04:53:59.688
CRIME TO SUPPORT THAT HABITS.

04:53:59.755 --> 04:54:00.789
AND THEY KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL

04:54:00.856 --> 04:54:02.491
THEY WIND UP DEAD ON THE GUTTER

04:54:02.558 --> 04:54:04.226
DEAD IN THE GUTTER. AND THEN

04:54:04.293 --> 04:54:07.062
EVERYBODY LAMENTS ABOUT OH MY

04:54:07.129 --> 04:54:08.030
GOD WHY CAN WE DO ANYTHING

04:54:08.097 --> 04:54:09.865
ABOUT THIS. AND IT SEEMS THAT

04:54:09.932 --> 04:54:10.966
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO

04:54:11.033 --> 04:54:12.434
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BY

04:54:12.501 --> 04:54:14.003
ALLOWING. SOMEBODY WHO GETS

04:54:14.069 --> 04:54:16.105
ARRESTED. AND IS GOING TO BE

04:54:16.171 --> 04:54:18.707

THEY'RE SERVING TIME. WHICH IN

04:54:21.610 --> 04:54:22.711
THIS CASE IS TAKING CARE OF THE

04:54:22.778 --> 04:54:23.879
PROBLEM THE PUT HIM THERE IN

04:54:23.946 --> 04:54:26.248

CAN EITHER DO NOTHING OR TAKE

04:54:28.884 --> 04:54:29.418

TO PRISON AND SITTING THERE IS

04:54:55.778 --> 04:54:57.279
NOT PRODUCTIVE IT'S NOT

04:54:57.346 --> 04:54:58.881
REHABILITATION AND IT DOES THE

04:54:58.947 --> 04:55:00.115

WE'RE DOING THAT A LOT AND WE

04:55:20.302 --> 04:55:20.736
