THE YOU YOU SEE REPRESENTATIVE THE CSU -- TO CSU REPRESENTATIVES AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CALL CHANCES OFFICE. OKAY END UP BEFORE WE BEFORE WE GET GOING I JUST WANT TO SAY FROM THE OUT OUT SAID THAT THIS IS. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR FOR JET DECADES AND GENERATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN -- MORE CUTE -- IN RECENT YEARS THE THE THE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH SUCCESS AND COLLEGE SUCCESS. AND WE JUST HAD AT A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION TWO DAYS AGO AT CSU SACRAMENTO. WHERE HER FROM STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THEIR FACE SAYING NOWADAYS SPECIALLY THE THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES AND? ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND HOW THAT IMPACTS THEIR STUDIES IN GETTING THEIR THEIR THEIR COURSES COMPLETED IN AND GETTING -- A AT THAT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO GET OUT OF IT OF HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT ALSO THE STUDENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE UNFORTUNATELY. GOING THROUGH SOME EPISODES IN TRYING TO GET HELP. THEY GO SIGN UP IN THE WELLNESS OFFICE. WHICH I THINK A GOOD THING IS NOW IN IN IN INCORPORATED WITH -- THE HOW THE HELL SERVICES WAS ON OUT LIAR THING SO HOPEFULLY CAN REDUCE THE STIGMAS BUT EVEN IF THEY DO GOOD IN THERE AND FIND SOMEBODY THAT CAN HELP. NOW IT'S COME BACK IN SEVEN WEEKS WELL THE CRISIS TODAY THE FINALS NEXT WEEK -- TUITION RENT SO FOR SO THESE ARE -- EACH ISSUES WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS FAR AS THE OVERALL SERVICES AND THE TIMELINESS OF IT SO WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO STEP UP IN THIS -- SPACE ESPECIALLY WITH OUR A UC AND CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- THE PARTNER SO WITH THAT -- PLEASE BEGIN WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE REPRESENTED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CARTY -- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS BRAD BUCKMAN I AM THE THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF US TO HEALTH AND COUNSELING AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC WITH YOU TODAY -- I'M JUST GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF SERVICES WE PROVIDE -- QUICKLY REVIEWED SOME OBSERVE UTILIZATION TRENDS WE'VE SEEN WITHIN YOU SEE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WHAT UC'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN AND WHY ARE WE ARE REQUESTING YOUR ASSISTANCE AND TO MAINTAIN AND AND EVEN GROW OUR CAPACITY IN A IN A IN A BACKDROP OF REALLY. ESCALATING DEMAND FROM OUR STUDENTS AND SO THE WORSENING SEVERITY OF ILLNESS -- GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ON GAPS WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE IF -- CURRENT FUNDING RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE NOW DO NOT CONTINUE AND THEN -- AT THE END JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT FURTHER -- STABILIZATION OF OUR CAPACITY FOR SERVICES AS WELL AS EXPANSION OF SERVICES IF NEW MONIES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED. SO WE GO TO SLIDE ONE JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF OUR CORE SERVICES -- THE FIRST CATEGORY OF THOSE HIS DIRECT SERVICES SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH DIRECT FACE TO FACE COUNSELING VISITS -- WHICH IS -- A VERY -- SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE SERVICES OUR COUNSELORS PROVIDE -- BUT AS YOU'LL SEE THERE'S MANY OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE COUNSELORS ARE INVOLVED WITH SO GROUP COUNSELING VISITS. URGENT CARE ARE CRISIS VISITS AND THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN A STUDENT IS ACTUALLY SEEN IN OUR MEDICAL CLINICS. AND IS VERY DISTRESSED AND THE MEDICAL STAFF MAY ASK FOR A URGENT CONSOLE FROM A FROM A COUNSELOR OR THERAPIST TO COME OVER AND VISIT WITH THEIR STUDENTS. THEY PROVIDE BACK UP FOR OUR AFTER HOURS CALL SERVICES. WE HAVE -- PSYCHIATRY CONSULTATIONS AVAILABLE A REFERRAL FOR LONG TERM CARE FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE MORE CHRONICALLY ILL OR OR VERY SEVERE INSIGNIFICANT ILLNESSES THAT REQUIRE. WEEKLY IF NOT MULTIPLE VISITS PER WEEK TO MANAGE -- AS WELL AS CASE MANAGEMENT AND A GOOD EXAMPLE THERE'S EATING DISORDER PATIENTS WHO MAY NEED -- COORDINATION OF THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CARE PROVIDERS -- TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE THOSE PATIENTS FROM AN OUT REACH STANDPOINT OUR COUNSELORS ARE INVOLVED IN -- LOTS OF PREVENTION ND EARLY INTERVENTION CAMPAIGNS -- OUR STUDENT LEADERS AND PEER ADVOCATES ARE ALSO A HUGE RESOURCE THAT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND EXTEND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES BY USING PEERS TO GET OUT AND GET THE WORD OUT. AND DE STIGMATIZE OUR SERVICES A BIT AND TRY TO GET STUDENTS AND WHEN THEIR PERHAPS NOT AS ILL AS IF THEY LET THEIR SYMPTOMS CONTINUE AND AND PROGRESS -- WE'RE ALSO VERY INTEGRATED WITH WELLNESS WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS. WE ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE SATELLITE CLINICS -- TO AREAS AND DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT THESE ARE -- DEPARTMENTS THAT TYPICALLY OUR STUDENTS ARE HIGHER UTILIZE RISK -- SOME GRAD DEPARTMENTS ARE IN THAT CATEGORY INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS -- SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF AND ANY NUMBER OF UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS THAT REPRESENT VULNERABLE GROUPS THEY ALSO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THE LAST CATEGORY OF CAMPUS CONSULTATION -- SO IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS ARE COUNSELORS ARE ACTIVELY -- INTEGRATING WITH OUR FACULTY AND STAFF PROVIDING TRAINING PROVIDING CONSULTATION TO CAMPUS ADMINISTRATION -- MAINTAINING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OF THESE HIGHER RISK DEPARTMENTS -- AND THEN A VERY KEY COMPONENT IS THEY PROVIDE CRISIS RESPONSE AND WE HAVE A TERRIBLE EVENTS HAPPEN ON OUR CAMPUS OR WE HAVE AN UNEXPECTED DEATH OF A STUDENT OR AN OVERDOSE. MANY STUDENTS ARE IMPACTED FACULTY STAFF AS WELL -- BUT OUR OUR COUNSELING CENTERS ARE VERY GOOD AT MOBILIZING SERVICES -- TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF MANY STUDENTS DURING A TRAGEDY I THE NEXT FLIGHT IS -- IS JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF OUR OBSERVED -- INCREASE IN UTILIZATION OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AND ON THIS GRAPH YOU CAN SEE THAT OVER THAT PERIOD WE'VE HAD ABOUT A 78% INCREASE. IN THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE CLIENT SEEN EACH YEAR SO THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT AN 8% INCREASE PER YEAR IN UNIQUE STUDENTS COMING TO OUR COUNSELING CENTERS. AT THE SAME PERIOD -- THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT YOU SEE INCREASED ONLY ABOUT 27% SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS DRIVING DEMAND -- AND THE LAST QUICK EXAMPLE -- IT THE NUMERICAL EXAMPLE IS THE PERCENT OF A STUDENT SEEN AS A PERCENT OF ENROLLMENT UNIQUE CLIENTS -- TEN YEARS AGO WAS ABOUT 9% OF OUR ENROLLMENT AND NOW IT'S ABOUT THE OTHER THING OUR COUNSELORS REALLY HARP ON IS JUST THE THE REALLY INCREASE IN SEVERITY OF ILLNESS THEY'RE SEEING MANY STUDENTS ARE ARRIVING AT UC ALREADY ON MEDICATIONS. OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING TO ACCESS COUNSELING SERVICES MORE THAN 50% OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN COUNSELING WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL -- THERE'S INCREASING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS WELL AS INCREASE IN SUICIDAL IDEATION WITH ABOUT TEN ALMOST 10% OF OUR STUDENTS. REPORTING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THIRD SLIDE -- TALKS ABOUT WHAT HAS YOU SEE DONE TO TRY AND RESPOND TO THIS ESCALATION IN DEMAND. YEARS AGO -- THE REGENTS APPROVED A STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDINGINITIATIVE WHICH A PLAN TO INCREASE OUR STUDENT SERVICES FEE BY 5% FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. AND THAT WAS APPROVED IN LATE TWENTY FOURTEEN AND IMPLEMENTED -- THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- AND THIS IS A FIVE YEAR PLAN -- WITH ABOUT 50% OF THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THAT INITIATIVE -- BEING EARMARKED FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. LAST YEAR OR THIS CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR THAT WERE ENDING IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS -- YOU SEE DID RECEIVE A QUITE GRATEFULLY A FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS -- IN LIEU OF THE STUDENT SERVICES FEE SO LAST YEAR WE DID NOT HAVE TO TAX OUR STUDENTS AN ADDITIONAL 5% IN THEIR STUDENT SERVICES FEE -- KEEP COMPONENT OF THAT THOUGH IS THAT IT'S ONE TIME MONEY AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH. SO TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE OUR REQUEST WE'RE ASKING TO MAKE A PERMANENT A ONE TIME FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS THAT YOU SEE RECEIVED -- LAST YEAR -- IN LIEU OF OUR STUDENT SERVICES FEE INCREASE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO ASSESS OUR STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY YOU WERE REQUESTING THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER APPROVING A FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR NEXT YEAR. ON THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS SLIDE -- FIVE I WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THROUGH THIS FUNDING INITIATIVE THAT STARTED IN. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE'VE HIRED ALMOST SEVENTY F. T. OF COUNSELORS. A WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECREASE THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME FOR OUR STUDENTS -- COMING IN FOR A ROUTINE INTAKE FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE FUNDING ARRIVING -- WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO WE GOT IT DOWN TO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT NINE DAYS AND THAT'S DRIFTED BACK UP TO ABOUT ELEVEN DAYS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ANOTHER A MARKER THAT WE USE TO MEASURE HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IS THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE SEEN IN A AND FOURTEEN CALENDAR DAYS. ADDITIONALLY AFTER WE STARTED THIS -- FUNDING INITIATIVE WE FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR WERE ABLE TO GET 80% OF OUR STUDENTS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. THAT HAS GRADUALLY DRIFTED DOWN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND 278% AND 74% -- BECAUSE OUR ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS CONTINUING -- TO INCREASE AND AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE VERY MUCH DRIVING DEMAND FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE'VE ACHIEVED VERY MUCH IMPROVE STUDENT SATISFACTION -- SCORES WITH OUR ACCESS -- WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME INNOVATIVE THINGS -- WHICH INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING CASE MANAGERS FOR COMPLICATED ILLNESSES THAT INVOLVE COORDINATED CARE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS. MANY OF OUR CENTERS HAVE MOVED COUNSELORS INTO THE URGENT CARE OR INTO THE MEDICAL CLINICS TO TRYING BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE WHEN A DISTRESSED STUDENT ARRIVES -- FOR ANOTHER REASON IN A MEDICAL CLINIC OR DECIDES TO GO THERE FIRST -- WE'VE ALSO FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS BEEN ABLE TO HOLD CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND IN IN YEARS PAST THAT HAS BEEN IN COLLABORATION WITH CSU IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK. ON TRAINING OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- TO BE CULTURALLY AWARE AND PROVIDE CONFIDENCE SERVICES LASTLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE THE PILOT -- DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES WEB BASED -- TECHNOLOGIES TO ASSIST STUDENTS AND AS AN ADJUNCT TO CARE TO COUNSELING CARE AS WELL AS FELLOW BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS SLIDE -- SIX TALKS ABOUT -- CONSEQUENCES FOR ARE YOU SEE STUDENTS IF OUR CURRENT FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR DOES EXPIRE ONJUNE THIRTIETH -- UNFORTUNATELY WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE F. T. E. OF COUNSELORS THAT WE HIRED -- JUST PRIOR TO THIS YEAR -- THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR US BOTH IN -- THE PERCENTAGE OF NEW HIRES IN THE PAST THREE YEARS -- ALMOST A THIRD OF THOSE ARE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A THIRD IN ABOUT 10% OF OUR COUNSELING STAFF IN ITS ENTIRETY. WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT THIS WOULD WORSEN ACCESSIBILITY AND CREATE DELAYS FOR STUDENTS IT WOULD DEFINITELY DECREASE PROVIDER DIVERSITY THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST -- PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN AND A MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN HIRED RECENTLY AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD AFFECT SAFETY AS WELL AS STUDENT SATISFACTION. IF -- WE WERE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL OF FUNDS IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING OUR OUR CURRENT ONE TIME FUNDS WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT -- YOU SEE IS PREPARED TO HIRE THE REMAINING -- THIRTEEN F. T. EVER COUNSELORS THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN THIS FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO STABILIZE FUNDING FOR SOME OF OUR EXISTING HIRES AND STAFF WERE ON TEMPORARY FUNDS. AND REALLY ALLOW US TO START WORKING ON TARGETED PREVENTION WORK -- OVERALL NET EFFECT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AT THE VERY LEAST IF NOT IMPROVE OUR CAPACITY -- CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR PROVIDER DIVERSITY. AND TRIED. TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE THAT OUR ACCESSIBILITY IS GOING TO GO DOWN WE WANT TO MAINTAIN STUDENT SAFETY. AND THEN FINALLY REALLY WORK ON A CAMPUS WIDE AND THEN VERY TARGETED AND FOCUSED PREVENTION WORK ON ARE VULNERABLE STUDENT POPULATIONS. WHICH I'LL JUST NOTE INCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TRANSFER STUDENTS ALWAYS TYPICALLY HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT TIME FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. VETERANS STUDENTS AND ANY NUMBER OF UNDERSERVED VULNERABLE RISK GROUPS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. BAHASA QUESTIONS WILL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE DAHLE THREE PANELS THAT CSU. YES SAID THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME IS DENISE PROBABLY OVERSEE -- STUDENT WELLNESS IN THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE FOR THE CSU AND I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FRAMERATE MARIA WHO OVERSEES -- STUDENT DIRECTOR OF STUDENT PROGRAMS FOR THE CSU. OUR CAMPUSES HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDE A MERRY OUT OF SERVICES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS FOCUSING ON THE EFFORTS ON EDUCATION OUTREACH TRAINING AND A Q. CRISIS CARE. ADDITIONALLY THIS YES YOU ACTIVELY DEVELOPS AND STRENGTHENS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO STUDENTS. IN CASES WHERE STUDENTS NEEDS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND CAMPUS CAPABILITIES ALL CAMPUSES PROVIDE IT'S THAT BASELINE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS AS OUTLINED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER TEN FIFTY THREE ON A POLICY ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH WHICH INCLUDES COUNSELING. SUICIDE AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SERVICES EMERGENCY CRISIS INTERVENTIONS OUT REACH CONSULTATION AND REFERRAL RESOURCES. OUR CAMPUS IS A SOUND THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH AND A VARIETY OF INNOVATIVE WAYS WHICH BREAKS DOWN THE STIGMA OF SEEKING HELP AND ADDRESSES PROBLEMS IN A HOLISTIC MANNER. FOR INSTANCE THE REAL PROGRAM BEGAN ON ONE CAMPUS THAT HAS NOW EXPANDED TO SEVERAL OTHER CAMPUSES. THE REAL PROBLEM PROGRAM IS A SERIES OF EMOTIONAL WELL BEING WORKSHOPS WHERE STUDENTS ARE INVITED TO ATTEND SMALL FOCUS SESSIONS THAT ADDRESS TOPICS. THAT MAY BE LEADING TO ANXIETY SUCH AS MANAGING THEIR FINANCES WITHOUT EVEN NECESSARILY SAYING THE WORDS MENTAL HEALTH THIS PROGRAM CONNECTS STUDENTS WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADDRESS ANXIETIES. AND FEEL MORE CONFIDENT. AND THE LET'S TALK PROGRAM CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED ON SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES COUNTERS MEET WITH STUDENTS AND HONEST ANONYMOUSLY FOR TWENTY MINUTE SESSIONS IN LOCATIONS AROUND CAMPUS. DURING WHICH THE COUNCIL RECESSES THE STUDENTS NEED IT MAY BE THAT THE STUDENT NEEDS TO TALK THROUGH AN ISSUE OR THE COUNTER MAY RECOMMEND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO MEET AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO MEET WITH THE COUNSELORS AND FAMILIAR SPACES. SUCH AS THE ENGINEERING BUILDING OR AT THE RESIDENCE HALL. OUR PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL SUCH AS ACTIVE MINES WHICH PROVIDES EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR STUDENTS TO HELP OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE DEALING WITH A MENTAL pHEALTH CHALLENGE. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF PART OF THIS MODEL OF POLITICALLY TREATING STUDENTS WELL BEING THROUGH EARLY INTERVENTION. AND INTERVENTION SERVICES AND NEEDS WAYS WE ARE TRYING TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND GETTING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNSELING CENTER BY ENGAGING WITH THEM AT EVERY STAGE OF THE SPECTRUM. BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE IS NOT ONLY NEEDED FOR THOSE IN CRISIS BUT SHOULD BE PROVIDED ENCOURAGED LONG BEFORE AN INDIVIDUAL REACHES THAT POINT. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CSU USE THE NATIONAL COLLEGE HEALTH ASSESSMENT SURVEY TO ASSESS STUDENT WELLNESS HEY HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE NCHA RESULTS PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE C. ISSUES HEALTH AND STUDENT WELL BEING. FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH DATA WE COULD SEE THAT CSU STUDENT DEMAND FOR SERVICES HAS INCREASED AND WE'RE STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS INCREASING SERVICES AND RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND. CAMPUSES HAVE INVESTED IN ADDITIONAL COUNSELOR POSITIONS AT A RATES ARE PASSING THE GROWTH OF STUDENT HEAD COUNT. BETWEEN FALL TWENTY TEN AND THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS YEAR'S TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT COUNSELOR POSITIONS BY 37%. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MANY OTHER CAMPUS PERSONNEL WHO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADDRESSING STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH. SUCH A POST DOCTORAL INTERNS TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES DOCTORS PSYCHIATRISTS AND LICENSE SOCIAL WORKER TO SERVE AT CASE MANAGERS. THE PROCESS FOR STUDENTS SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES VARIES FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS AND MOST CASES STUDENTS MAY ARRIVE AT THE COUNTING CENTER AS A RESULT OF A CAMPUS OUTREACH PROGRAM AS A WALK IN FROM A PHONE CALL. OR BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPERIENCING A CRISIS. IN MANY CASES IT IS THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE OF A FACULTY MEMBER WHO HAS RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS THAT THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH TO STRESS OR THROUGH PEER TO PEER HEALTH EDUCATION. WHEN A STUDENT ARRIVES IN SEVERE CRISIS MOST CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE STUDENTS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES OR HOURS WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN INITIAL CONSULTATION APPOINTMENT WITH A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL? STUDENTS ARE THEN SCHEDULE FOR THEIR FIRST VISIT WHEN THE TREATMENT PLAN IS DETERMINED. IF A STUDENT IN CRISIS THE TREATMENT PLAN IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY. THE TREATMENT PLAN IS PERSONALIZED FOR EACH STUDENT INCLUDES SOME COMBINATION OF COUNSELING OR A COMMUNITY REFERRAL IF THE STUDENTS NEEDS ARE BEYOND CAMPUS CAPABILITIES. AFTER THE TREATMENT PLANT HAS BEEN UNDER WAY THE STUDENTS THE MEETS BACK WITH THE LIGHTS AND PROFESSIONAL ON CAMPUS TO REVIEW AND RE WRITE THE TREATMENT PLAN AS NEEDED. THIS CYCLE CONTINUES UNTIL BOTH THE STUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL FEEL THE STUDENTS READY TO IN THE PROCESS. WE ARE CONTINUALLY WORKING TO AS A SYSTEM TO STRENGTHEN THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ARE FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME BUDGET REQUEST FOR BASIC NEEDS WOULD BE UTILIZED TO BUILDING STRENGTH IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO CREATE COMPREHENSIVE CARE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES. INCLUDING THOSE -- TO THEIR BASE TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTHY'S BILL THE CARD IS BILL I'M AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH ALLOCATES FIVE MILLION PROP SIXTY THREE DOLLARS TO THE CSU PER YEAR TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO IMPROVE STUDENTS ACCESS TO MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES. AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO CAMPUS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION OUTREACH TRAINING IN A QUEUE CRISIS CARE THERE ARE NUMBER OF SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES UNDER WAY. THE CHANCES OFFICE HOST ANNUAL I CAN HELP SUICIDE PREVENTION AND WELL BEING IN BATH OR TRAINING. BOTH BRING TOGETHER FACULTY AND STAFF SYSTEM WIDE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TOOLS AND INFORMATION TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS. AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS THROUGH APPROPRIATE REFERRALS. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO EXPAND THIS TRAINING TO REACH ADDITIONAL FACULTY AND STAFF. AS A RESULT OF A SYSTEM WIDE GRANT FROM THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE ALREADY ALL CAMPUSES HAVE AT LEAST ONE STAFF MEMBER THAT'S BEEN TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR STATE. Q. P. R. OR THE ASSIST TRAIN THE TRAINER PROGRAM WHICH TEACHES PARTICIPANTS TO RECOGNIZE AND HELP WHEN SOMEONE MAY HAVE THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. AND JUST WEEKS AGO APRIL TENTH THE SEATS YOU ACTED AS THE CONVENER TO SUPPORT CAMPUS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS BY HOSTING THE FIRST EVER STATEWIDE CONVENING ON COLLEGE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND FIFTEEN COUNTIES. OUT OF THE EIGHTEEN THAT OVERLAP WITH OUR CAMPUSES ATTENDED. AS WELL AS HEADS OF STATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL MESA THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING WHAT TO CONNECT LOCAL COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WITH CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. TO STAFF AND STAFF TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS GAPS TO RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS DEALING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. WE ANTICIPATE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL IDENTIFY WAYS THAT CAMPUSES AND COUNTIES CAN WORK ON PRIORITIZING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COLLEGE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND SERVICES TO ALIGN WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB. ONE THOUSAND FOUR WE CAME AWAY FROM THIS MEETING WITH THREE MAIN GOALS ONE TO CREATE A CONTACT LIST STATEWIDE OF CAMPUS AND COUNTY. DIRECTORS AND STAFF SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE SECOND IS TO HAVE A IN PERSON MEETING BETWEEN CAMPUS AND COUNTY OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT GAPS IN AREAS AND WE'RE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. AND THE THIRD IS TO CREATE AN ONGOING REGIONAL MEETING SO THAT CAMPUS ISN'T COUNTIES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY CAN SHARE BEST PRACTICES CHALLENGES. AND WAYS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CONTEXT OF THESE SPECIFIC REGIONS. AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR OVER WHILE WELL BEING. I INVESTMENTS IN STUDENT SUCCESS AND TIMELY GRADUATION WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AND NEXT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE REPRESENTATIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHARLIE MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. HI MY NAME IS COLLEEN GANLEY AND I'M A PROGRAM SPECIALIST WITH THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND I'VE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF WORKING WITH OUR HUNDREDS OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM FOR CLOSE TO A DECADE -- WE'VE WORKED VERY VERY CLOSELY ON MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PREVIOUS FUND FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH PROP SIXTY THREE OR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACARIDAE GRANT MAKING TO THIRTY OF THE COLLEGES AND DID. MANY STATEWIDE INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. I'M A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF THE UC AND THE CSU SYSTEMS -- WE ARE A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN SCHOOLS WE HAVE SEVENTY BRICK AND MORTAR HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES MANY OF WHOM PROVIDE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- WE HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ACROSS OUR SYSTEM AND HAVE IDENTIFIED NINETY OF THE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THEIR STUDENTS HOWEVER. THOSE THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE OF SERVICES AVAILABLE ARE VERY LIMITED -- MOST MOST OFTEN ONE TO THREE MENTAL HEALTH SESSIONS PER SEMESTER IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM THAT STUDENTS CAN ACCESS -- GENERALLY SPEAKING WE HAVE ONE TWO FOUR PROVIDERS AT A GIVEN COLLEGE MANY OF WHOM ARE PART TIME REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE STUDENT BODY SO THAT COULD BE ONE TO FOUR PART TIME MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. FOR A STUDENT BODY OF THE SIZE OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WERE NOT VERY CLOSE TO MEETING -- STATE RECOGNIZED RATIOS OF STUDENT TO COUNSELOR -- WHAT THERE ARE ABLE TO OFFER IS QUITE LIMITED ALL THE COLLEGES HAVE PROTOCOL REGARDING CRISIS INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS PRESENTING IMMEDIATE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS? AND THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TEAMS THAT HELP ADDRESS STUDENTS THAT ARE IN DISTRESS -- WE COLLECT VERY LIMITED CENTRALIZED DATA AROUND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THOUGH BASED ON AN INFORMAL SURVEY ACROSS OUR HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION PROFESSIONALS EXCUSE ME -- WE ESTIMATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS HAVE AT LEAST A ONE TO THREE WEEK WAIT FOR AN APPOINTMENT THOUGH THESE WAIT TIMES DUE VERY ACROSS THE SYSTEM. MOST OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHARGE A HEALTH SERVICE FEE WHICH FUNDS MUCH OF THIS WORK IT'S TWENTY ONE DOLLARS PER SEMESTER PER STUDENT. SO YOU CAN GET A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS A SEMESTER PER STUDENT -- THE LARGER CAMPUSES HAVE LARGER HEALTH CENTER BUDGETS BUT THEY'RE STILL LIMITED BECAUSE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO COVER THE FULL SCOPE OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS. WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET WE GOT -- PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS OF FOR A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE TO THE COLLEGES WE DID GRANT OF COMPETITIVE GRANT MAKING PROCESS AND SELECTED FIFTEEN DISTRICTS WHICH ENCOMPASS TWENTY SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY RECEIVED GRANTS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE OF WHAT WAS IN THEIR APPLICATION. I'M WE DID HAVE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE DELAYS HOWEVER THOSE GRANT DOLLARS ARE OUT TO THE COLLEGE AND BEING OPERATIONALIZED THERE TO BE PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO STUDENTS TO PROVIDE FACULTY AND STAFF AND STUDENTS TRAINING AROUND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND TO INCREASE RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- WE DO HAVE A FULL DIRECTORY THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE COLLEGES THAT TELLS THEM WHO IS THERE AN HSA COUNTERPART IN THEIR COUNTY -- WE HAVE STARTED CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM TO BRIDGE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS I THINK SOMETIMES HOWEVER -- THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AREN'T ALWAYS AS STUDENT ORIENTED -- AS ONE MIGHT HOPE -- A LOT OF TIMES THE STUDENTS THAT ARE -- HAVE LESS A LESSER DEGREE OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR UNLESS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY THEY DON'T NECESSARILY MEET THE CRITERIA. OF WHAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REQUIRES IN TERMS OF GETTING SERVICE SO THEY DON'T HAVE A SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT -- MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS -- SO THEY DON'T MEET THE ELIGIBILITY FOR COUNTY SERVICES IN EVERY INSTANCE INSIDE I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING -- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT THE PROP SIXTY THREE THAT A PRETTY FUNDS IS SUPPOSED TO BE DIRECTED TO FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IT WOULD BE. HELPFUL TO KNOW IF THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE WERE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL AT OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDING THAT CAME TO ALL THREE SYSTEMS IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE SAW AN INCREDIBLE -- GROUND SWELL OF WORK AND STIGMA REDUCTION AND AWARENESS ABOUT THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS SO WE ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT -- WE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE ALSO DID GET A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME ALLOCATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM WE APPROPRIATED THAT TO ALL HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES BASED ON F. T. E. S. -- WE HAVE A REPORT THAT WILL BE PROVIDING TO YOU ON THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE DOLLARS ON JULY. ONE WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DATA THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WE HAD A CONSORTIUM OF TEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT PARTICIPATED IN. THE NATIONAL COLLEGE HEALTH ASSESSMENT -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE COLLECTED SURVEYS FROM US SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS AND OF THOSE STUDENTS TO THIS NATIONAL COLLEGE HEALTH ASSESSMENT -- TWENTY FOUR POINT 8% OF STUDENTS REPORTED ANXIETY LEVELS THAT WAS IMPACTING AND IMPEDING THEM ACADEMICALLY -- SEVENTEEN POINT PUT LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAT WERE IMPACTING THEM ACADEMICALLY -- FIFTY EIGHT POINT 9% WERE FEELING HOPELESS. A 55% FILLED OVERWHELMING ANXIETY THIRTY EIGHT POINT 8% FELT SO DEPRESSED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FUNCTION. 11% CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED SUICIDE AND 2% ATTEMPTED SUICIDE -- AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE TWO POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS IF YOU EXTRAPOLATED THOSE FIGURES ACROSS OUR ENTIRE STUDENT BODY -- THERE WOULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT NEED REFLECTED AND SO -- I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE WE LOOK FORWARD. TO THE ON GOING DISCUSSION ABOUT SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN AND PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME ASK A QUESTION FOR ALL OF THE SEGMENTS SO. OF COURSE WE KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A BIG. I NEED HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT GOT RIGHT NOW AND ONGOING MONEY WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE TIME MONEY OF COURSE SPECIALLY WITH PERSONNEL AND STAFFING. SO WE DID GIVE THE COMMITTEE CALLS AS ONE ONE TIME MONEY LAST YEAR THAN YOU SEE YOU MENTION YOUR YOUR ONE TIME. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA TEND TO TO LOOK AT ONGOING AND WE'RE OF AS YOU MENTIONED LOOKING AT THE PROP SIXTY THREE STATE ADMIN -- A POT OF MONEY WHICH GOES FOR STATE WHY PRIORITIES AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A DESIRE TO HELP YOUNGER PEOPLE AND WE THINK DECIDED BE AT STATEWIDE PRIORITY -- SO BUT BUT IF IF THERE IS ONLY A CHANCE TO GET ONE TIME MONEY. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE THAT THE CAMPUS? TO HIRED LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IS IT. IS IT YOU DO LIKE A CONTRACT TO WEAR WITH WITH YOUR PROFESSIONALS THESE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT HOW LOGISTICALLY DE DO THAT I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE QUESTION FOR YOU OR YOUR FOR YOUR BUDGET PEOPLE BUT WELL NO I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT -- THESE FOR US -- SO I'M WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU RECRUIT TO TRY TO RETAIN OR HIRE SOMEBODY -- FOR A LIMITED CONTRACT POSITION THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION YOU GET A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POOL OF CANDIDATES YOU YOU'RE NOT DEALING NECESSARILY WITH THE SAME KINDS OF OF PROVIDERS OR OR QUALITY. AND IF IF WE WERE UNABLE TO GET AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET ONE TIME MONEY THAN THAT COULD SUSTAIN SOME OF OUR CURRENT PROVIDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY AT RISK. IF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS SUFFICIENT TO ALSO DO SOME TARGETED PREVENTION WORK THAT PROBABLY BE OUR NEXT PRIORITY IF NO MONEY COMES IN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- WE WOULD HAVE TO LET GO PROVIDERS THAT WE THAT WE PART AND HOW ABOUT FOR THE OTHER. OTHERS I WOULD SAY IT'S A SIMILAR SITUATION THE THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS HAVE REALLY ALLOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO RAMP UP. THE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS IT THESE DOLLARS HAVE ALSO ALLOWED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS WHERE OUR COUNTERPART TO THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGES BRING THEIR MSW STUDENTS -- ONTO OUR CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE SERVICES SO A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE CREATED SOME INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND LEVERAGING THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGES AND THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS --IF THE MONEY. I'M GONNA SAY THAT ONE TIME MONEY IS IS GOOD BETTER THAN NO TIME MONEY YEAH -- I LIKE THAT NO TIME. I DON'T MEAN TO BE SO CASUAL -- ONGOING MONEY WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS PEOPLE WILL BE LAID OFF YEAH WHAT ABOUT HIRING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE PROFESSION. WE DON'T TO LAY THEM OFF IN OTHER WORDS YOU WANT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON CAMPUS. AND THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE MAYBE A PRACTICE. AND YOU COULD CONSULT WITH THEM TO COME OVER AND SPEND TEN HOURS A WEEK AT YOUR COMMITTEE COLLEGE CAMPUS AS OPPOSED TO BEING AT THEIR AT THEIR OFFICE WHEREVER THEY'RE AT AND SO YOU'RE NOT. NECESSARILY -- HIRING PEOPLE LAYING PEOPLE OFF BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOUR STUDENT. YOU DON'T CARE IF THE PERSON TO HELP YOU THAT DAY OR THE NEXT WEEK. AS AN EMPLOYEE LEADERS CALIFORNIA OR IS -- YOU KNOW JAMES MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I THINK MANY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO HAVE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AREN'T CARRYING THE FULL OVERHEAD. OF A 100% OF THE COST OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AT EACH OF THE CAMPUS IS SPECIALLY FOR SMALLER CAMPUSES SO I THINK THAT IS ACTUALLY THE PRACTICE THAT HAPPENS. IN MANY OF THE SMALLER COLLEGES WHERE THEY CONTRACT FOR CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS WITH PROFESSIONAL OKAY DID THAT CSU FOLKS WHEN THE SAME THING HERE. WELL I THINK FOR US WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIP AS BEING KIND OF THE CRUX OF ARM MIDDLE HOLE SUPPORT -- BECAUSE OUR CAMPUSES AS WELL OR NOT NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE WITH HIRING -- MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT IT BEING ON GOING SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR MODELS -- AT CSU SAN BERNARDINO AS THEY WORK WITH THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY PROVIDES AND A PERSON A COUNSELOR CASE MANAGER TO THAT ACTUALLY SEES STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE MODELS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED WITH THE POTENTIAL OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND THEN ALSO -- THE SB ONE THOUSAND FOUR DOLLARS SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS UNDERSTANDING THAT -- ALLY THE NEED TO DO GO BEYOND THE CAMPUS SCOPE AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE -- LEVERAGE THAT WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. SO I ACTUALLY DO AN AD REMEDIAL FROM THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR AS WELL ON THE IDEA OF THE CONTRACTED A WORKERS WE ACTUALLY DO THAT WITH PSYCHIATRY. PSYCHIATRY'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST HIGHEST NEED THAT WE'RE FINDING IN OUR SYSTEM BUT IT STILL COMES WITH CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT'S A CHI TREES IN HIGH DEMAND ON CAMPUS AS WELL AS OFF CAMPUS OF THEIR TIME IS LIMITED. AS WELL AS THE COST IS VERY VERY HIGH YEAH -- SO THE MENTAL HEALTH CERTAINLY WE HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT DO HAVE SOME PROVIDERS THAT COULD IN FACT BE AVAILABLE ON A RETAINER TO HELP OUT PERIODICALLY ON OUR CAMPUSES. THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES LIKE HUMBOLDT THAT THEY'RE JUST DON'T EXIST SO THEY'RE GONNA BE STRAPPED JUST BECAUSE IT AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS BUT ALSO IT WOULD ANTICIPATE AND HAVING CONTRACTED WORK. WE WOULD MOST LIKELY PROBABLY RUN INTO SOME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES ON THAT OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NEXT -- BRING OUT FOR SEASON QUESTIONS FOR THE FOLKS. SACRAMENTO BEE AT OF FRONT PAGE STORY I BELIEVE YESTERDAY ON THE BERKELEY STUDY ON A MENTAL HEALTH. IN -- IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND I I I I THINK THE THE BERKELEY STUDY -- WAS VERY -- VERY MUCH -- SHOWING THE SAME KIND OF DATA THAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE ON THE ESCALATING DEMAND. OF FROM FROM UC -- WHEN WE WERE ON AT ON THE UCLA CAMPUS WE HEARD A LOT FROM STUDENTS ABOUT THE NEED FOR OF PRACTITIONERS WHO REFLECTED THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR CULTURES THEIR LANGUAGES -- SO WONDERED IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO THINGS SURE I'LL JUST MENTION IN OUR IN OUR FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE THAT WE HAD -- UNDERTAKEN IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN 50% OF THOSE PROVIDERS WERE -- WE ATTEMPTED TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS WITH -- A PROVIDERS WITH BACKGROUNDS ETHNICITIES WILL -- THE KINDS OF COUNSELORS -- THAT REFLECTED OUR STATE BETTER REFLECTED OUR STUDENT POPULATION -- AND SO THAT'S AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE PROVIDERS ARE ALWAYS HARDER TO FIND HARDER TO RECRUIT AND HARDER TO RETAIN. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO HIRE -- I THINK OUT OF THE SEVENTY THAT I MENTIONED US. IT'S CLOSE TO FIFTY OF THOSE PROVIDERS WERE WERE TARGETED BY THEIR CAMPUSES BASED ON THE CAMPUS THE CIVIC POPULATIONS. STRATEGY THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE FOR COMING IN LATE AND SO -- THE PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME IF IF YOU COVER THIS BUT TO WE WE WE'VE BEEN HAVING TO SEVERAL. HEARINGS -- IN THE AT ADDRESSING GO -- IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER -- THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH -- NEEDS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS. THIS ESCALATING DEMAND AND INCREASING SEVERITY OF ILLNESS BUT YOU KNOW I I I THINK IT'S MULTI FACTORIAL AND EVERYBODY HERE COULD PROBABLY COMMENT I I THINK THAT -- A NUMBER OF THINGS LOWERING THE STIGMA SO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ACTUALLY MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT STUDENTS WILL COME IN WHO HAVE LOWER LEVEL SYMPTOMATOLOGY THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO COME IN IT'S NOT A SCARY IF THEY START. TO THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE -- AN ISSUE WITH THAT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW WORKED OUT THROUGH THROUGH COUNSELING SO SO THAT'S THAT'S A VERY BIG FACTOR I THINK. YOU KNOW THIS THIS -- GENERATIONAL COHORT AND AND THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE GROWN UP IN I THINK AGAIN WE HAVE MANY MORE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THE POLITICAL SITUATION CERTAINLY IS PUTTING A LOT OF STRESS ON ON MANY MANY STUDENTS -- FINANCIAL PRESSURES -- CONCERNED -- ABOUT THEIR WELL BEING ON CAMPUS OR IF THEY ENGAGE WITH STUDENT HEALTH AND COUNSELLING OR WHAT HOW WITH THOSE RECORDS POTENTIALLY BE USED AGAINST THEM -- WE HAVE MORE TRANSFER STUDENTS AND THEY I THINK HAVE A UNIQUE CHALLENGES COMPARED TO SOMEONE -- WHO WHO WHO COMES ON SO I THINK YOU KNOW GREAT COMPETITION -- THEY'RE USED TO BEING OF THE BRIGHTEST -- OF THEIR CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY ARRIVE AT UNIVERSITIES AND NOW EVERYBODY'S AT THAT LEVEL OF THOUGHT HIGHER AND SUDDENLY SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN A STRAIGHT A STUDENT IS GETTING A LOT OF BEES IN THE FIRST. QUARTER OR SEMESTER AND AND AND IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADAPTION THEY HAVE TO MAKE SO I I DON'T KNOW IF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE OTHER. THOUGHTS ABOUT THE STRONGEST FACTORS BUT IT'S REALLY A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING. SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU KNOW ONE THING I THINK THAT THAT YOU ALLUDED TO AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THE SIGNIFICANT WORK BACK STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AT WITH AN HSA PROP SIXTY THREE DOLLARS. I THINK ACROSS ALL THREE SYSTEMS -- THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK AND WORK CONTINUES AROUND REDUCING STIGMA. AND AROUND TO CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND ADDRESSING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT STUDENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING THAT INCLUDING LATINO STUDENTS INCLUDING. STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO WHERE FROM THEIR CULTURES THERE MAY BE TOO MUCH STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ACCESSING CARE AND THEN THEY FIND SOME INDEPENDENCE WHEN THEY COME TO COLLEGE IN WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON REDUCING STIGMA. AND YOU'RE MAKING IT OKAY TO GET HELP -- I THINK IT'S NOT A BAD THING FOR PEOPLE TO GET HELP I THINK -- THAT SOME OF THE INCREASE IN ACCESSING SERVICES HAS TO DO WITH THAT REDUCTION AND STIGMA. AND REALLY HELPS -- TO REDUCE MORE CATASTROPHIC MENTAL ILLNESS IF IF LEFT UNADDRESSED AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO TO REDUCE STIGMA. AND TO BRING GREATER AWARENESS AND TO MAKE IT OKAY TO ACCESS HELP. ON THAT INCREASES SERVICES THAT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON THE INSTITUTIONS TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT HELP -- BUT I THINK IN THE BIGGER PICTURE IT HELPS TO REDUCE. ONGOING LIFETIME CATASTROPHIC MENTAL ILLNESS AND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES HAVE PROVEN. THAT THAT HELPS CURTAIL THAT LIFETIME OF MENTAL ILLNESS IF LEFT UNTREATED. OKAY THANK YOU LET'S THAT BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL ON THE SAME TOPIC. IF YOU HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT STEINBERG INSTITUTE WORK ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ADRIN SHELTON. AS WELL AS A STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ADRIAN SHELTON AND I'M FROM THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WAS FOUNDED BY SACRAMENTO'S MAYOR AND FORMER PRO TEM OF THE SENATE DARRELL STEINBERG. AND OUR MISSION IS TO ADVANCE PUBLIC POLICY INSPIRED LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US TODAY -- ENJOYING THIS REALLY WONDERFUL PANEL DISCUSSION TO ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR STATE. IT'S SO CLEAR TO US THAT WE HAVE DEDICATED PARTNERS FROM THE COLLEGES WHO BELIEVE LIKE US THE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. WE HAVE THE STEINBERG AS A TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT. WITH REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF IN YOUR LEADERSHIP. TO REALLY BRING ATTENTION TO WHAT WHAT WE THINK IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME. STUDENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GOES HAND IN HAND WITH SUCCESS. IN COLLEGE. BUT WE KNOW THAT OFTEN STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDED AND LIFESAVING. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WHEN THEY NEED THEM THE MOST. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE SPONSORING ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH IS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. WHICH WOULD SET UP A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OUR STATE. FUNDED BY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT STATE ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS. TO INVEST SPECIFICALLY AND STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. WE SET A FRAMEWORK IN THE BILL SO IT DOES NOT DICTATE THE LOCAL SOLUTION. PRIORITIES AROUND PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY EITHER THE COUNTIES ARE COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES. AND ALSO PROGRAMS THAT TARGET UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS LGBT OR VETERANS OR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE RACIAL -- INEQUITIES. WE KNOW THAT PUBLIC COLLEGES IN MANY CASES DO NOT MEET THE NATIONAL STOPPING STANDARDS FOR PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND THAT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON PUBLIC COLLEGE CAMPUSES VERY IS AS AS WE HAVE HEARD TODAY AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE SPONSORING AB. SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND WHY WE WORK ON YEAR AFTER YEAR ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE WE REALLY OUR VISION IS THAT EVERY CALL EVERY PUBLIC COLLEGE CAMPUS IN CALIFORNIA HAS. A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS. IDENTIFY STUDENTS AT RISK AND PROVIDE THOSE NEEDED SUPPORTS AND PROVIDE THOSE LINKAGES TO OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE COLLEGES UNDERSTAND THIS NEED AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE ALSO HEARD TODAY UPDATES FROM THE SEGMENTS ON THE CSU MENTIONED THAT. WE LOVE THIS THAT THEY HAD -- RECENTLY CONVENED -- HEALTH CAMPUS DIRECTORS WITH THE COUNTIES TO TALK ABOUT BEST PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH -- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN THE UC REGENTS EARMARKED FUNDING TO HIRE ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FIVE CLINICIANS ACROSS THEIR SYSTEM. AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DESPITE THEIR FUNDING CONSTRAINTS ARE STEPPING UP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS THIS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IS THAT. THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- MUST BE A STATEWIDE PRIORITY BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES. OF STUDENTS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS DESIGNED TO DEAL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE FURTHERS THIS INTENT. ADDRESSES THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR YOUTH. AND CALLS OUT MEANT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH IS A STATE WIDE PRIORITY THAT IT MUST BE. AND SO I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY WITH MARY ELIZABETH ALEXANDER WHO IS A STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE TO SHARE. SOME OF HER EXPERIENCE. HEY -- MY NAME IS MARY ELIZABETH ALEXANDER AND LIKE SHE SAID I'M A STUDENT AT SAC CITY COLLEGE AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MY OWN MENTAL HEALTH EXPERIENCES WHILE I'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE. AND I'VE STRUGGLED WITH BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SINCE CHILDHOOD AND HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY IN PTSD. IN COLLEGE I FELT THE CRUSHING DREAD OF THE FUTURE AND OF POTENTIAL FAILURE AND THE HIGH PRESSURE OF MY CLASSES. THEN THERE IS THE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY OF MY CLASSMATES FEEDING INTO MY OWN AN EASE. I WOULD SET EVERY DAY IN CLASSES ON ALLOWED. BUSTLING CAMPUS AS MY SOCIAL ANXIETY MADE ME WANT TO HIDE. I STARTED MISSING CLASSES BECAUSE I WAS TOO SCARED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE. THE TIPPING POINT FOR ME WAS AND A SOCIOLOGY CLASS. ONE OF THE LAST TWO CLASSES OF THAT SEMESTER THAT I HADN'T DROPPED DUE TO MY INCREASING ANXIETY. AND THE THE BIGGEST MOMENT OF THE SEMESTER WAS A SOCIAL NORM REACH EXPERIMENT -- THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO BEHAVE STRANGELY IN PUBLIC TO GET REACTIONS OUT OF PEOPE. AND I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T EVEN GO OUTSIDE. I TRIED TO WORK UP THE COURAGE BUT I STRUGGLED WITH THAT AIM OF CALLING ATTENTION TO MYSELF AND PUBLIC. THE ASSIGNMENT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CLASS AND TO MESSAGE MEANT FAILURE. COULD ADDED TO MY LIST OF THAT FAILED AND DROPPED CLASS. I WAS SO PARALYZED WITH FEAR I ENDED UP JUST HIDING AT HOME FOR MONTHS BARELY ABLE TO LEAVE -- EVERYTHING IN COLLEGE AND MY PERSONAL LIFE CULMINATED AND ENDED WITH ME FEELING BROKEN. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HELP. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD EVEN GET HELP -- I DROPPED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FOURTH SEMESTER OF COLLEGE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THE STORY BUT MENTAL HEALTH IS RARELY DISCUSSED IF THIS WERE. PART OF THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION IF THERE WERE RESOURCES TO HELP ME OR EVEN INFORMATION ABOUT RESOURCES. THEN I MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY ON TRACK. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE COMMON. BUT SUPPORT WITHIN THE SYSTEM IS NOT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO COME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IT TO US TODAY'S MAY FIRST JUST BY COINCIDENCE. THIS IS -- THE FIRST DAY MAINTENANCE MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH AND SO -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- REDUCE THE STIGMA. AS WE HEARD THE OUR DAY AT SAC STATE. IF YOU'RE HAVING. A BRIEF PROBLEM BREATHING. GOT FOR BIDS FALLEN. DINO SPRAIN YOUR ANKLE ON CAMPUS HAVING SOME OTHER ISSUE YOU CAN GO TO THE HEALTH CENTER AND IT'S LIKE OKAY COME ON AND SAY TO HELP THEM AND BUT WHEN IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH AILMENT -- TOO OFTEN PEOPLE THINK OF THAT AS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PUT TO THE SIDE BUT IT'S STILL PART OF OUR HEALTH ITSELF -- THANKS FOR FOR TESTIFYING AND AND YEAH IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT JUST FOR OUR OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO NOW WE DO HAVE VERY LIMITED. GENERAL FUND WE HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES AND ROMANCE FUNDING PROPERLY FUNDING THE UC AND CSU. OPS ONE THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THIS IS THAT PROP SIXTY THREE FUN THERE IS A AS OF COURSE MAJORITY MONIES GO OUT TO THE COUNTIES FOR THEIR PRIORITIES BUT THERE'S SOME. MONEY HELD BACK IN THIS SO CALLED STATE ADMIN ACCOUNTS -- TO FOCUS ON STATE PRIORITIES AND SO WE THINK THIS AUDIT B.. ESTATE PRIORITY SO THAT'S ARE LOOKING AT DOING IS IS FURTHER HELPING THE UCC ISSUED KAMALA COMMUNICABLE SYSTEM -- BUT WITH. ANOTHER -- POT OF MONEY SO WE CAN USE OUR SCARCE RESOURCES TO FRANKLY AND ROLL MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MARTUCCI THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I WANTED THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND YOU KNOW. I IS SPOKE RECENTLY AT A SIT IN MENTAL HEALTH -- EVENT WHERE THEY THEY TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A OF A ROLE MODEL SPEAKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. ABOUT THEIR OWN STRUGGLED IN ORDER TO HELP REMOVE THE STIGMA AND I I CAN SAY THAT I STRUGGLE DURING MY COLLEGE YEARS AND YOU KNOW AND I AND I SAW SOME -- SOME COUNSELINGAND AND AND SO I KNOW THE THE THE THE NEED FOR THE SUCH SERVICES -- YEAH I I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE THAT THAT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IN MAINE -- IT WAS. LOOKING AT MISTER MCCARTY IS A BILL HERE AND AND AND AND IT'S THE TARGET IN THE UC CSU AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES BUT I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT THATYOU KNOW. EARLIER INTERVENTION LIKE YOU KNOW HAVING THE STATE ADMIN FUNDS ACCESS YOU KNOW K. R. K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THAT WE IF IF IF THERE IS ANY -- YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE THAT THERE MIGHT BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE TO INTERVENE EARLIER ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS IS THAT 50% MANIFEST BY THE AGE OF BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR SO ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO BE DOING MUCH MORE EARLIER -- ONE OF THE ITEMS WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER WAS SB -- TEN FOR A BILL THAT WE HAD SPONSORED AND WAS SIGNED LAST YEAR INTO LAW AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID AT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WAS MANDATE A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE PREVENTION DOLLARS THE COUNTY SCAT -- TO FOCUS MORE STRATEGICALLY ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO ONE OF THOSE AREAS IS ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ENCOURAGING PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS -- SO THIS IS PART OF SORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE THAT WERE WORKING ON NOT TO SAY THAT THIS SHOULD -- YOU'LL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED HERE BUT IT'S IN A WEEK WE ALSO THINK THAT MORNING TO BE DONE WITH IT WITH THE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND AND WORK ON A MYRIAD OF ISSUES BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS IS THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO BE DOING MUCH MORE EARLIER -- FOR FOR KIDS AND ENCOURAGING THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH WHAT K. TWELVE AS WELL MR MEDINA. HI I WANNA THANK -- THE STUDENT -- FOR SCHERING -- STORY -- YOU KNOW TOO MANY TIMES COLLEGE STUDENTS -- OUR AFRAID OR OR OR CAN'T WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ASK FOR HELP. AND I HEAR THE STORIES -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN. OF US STUDENTS SOMETIMES EVEN FOREIGN STUDENTS OR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM FAR AWAY. AND JUST PARALYZED OF WITH WHAT'S GOING N WITH THEM IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND MAY BE FAR AWAY. FROM HOME AND ARE ARE KIND OF STUCK ON CAMPUS. AND DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHERE TO REACH OUT AND AND HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME -- REACHING OUT SO I APPRECIATE THANK THE STUDENT FOR BRINGING THIS UP AND I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THE CAMPUSES. YOU KNOW CAN CAN START -- DOING MORE AND MORE TO MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS CAN BE AWARE TO THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT DON'T HAPPEN YOU KNOW THE STORY OF A STUDENT WHO WILL STAY. A MAYBE A WHOLE SEMESTER WITHOUT GETTING HELP. IN IN IN A IN A DORM ROOM. BUT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN AND AND I HOPE THEY WILL HAPPEN LESS AND LESS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THIS LIMóN. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ECHO -- MY COLLEAGUES THINGS TO BOTH OF YOU BUT PARTICULARLY YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY I THINK IT'S A STORY THAT. REGRETTABLY. IS ALL TOO COMMON AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT SOME TIME WORKING IN HIGHER ED -- I MYSELF HAD TO WALK OF THE STUDENTS TO OUR EQUIVALENT OF LIKE CAPS AT UC SANTA BARBARA -- MULTIPLE TIMES AND I KNOW THAT AT THE TIME -- THERE WAS. THE ABILITY TO SEE SOMEONE ON THE SPOT UNDER VERY DIRE. SITUATION WHICH IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO SEE STUDENTS EVER GET -- BUT THE WAIT LIST WAS I MEAN THE WAIT WAS AT LEAST TWO THREE WEEKS I HEAR THAT THAT'S GONE UP SINCE I LEFT THE CAMPUS IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIX AT THE WEIGHTS ARE LONGER -- BUT I ALSO HEAR FROM FOLKS IN K. TWELVE SO I I'M TRYING TO THINK OF YOU KNOW IN OUR EDUCATION COMMUNITY. WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH BECAUSE -- THIS IS BIGGER I'VE NEVER HEARD AS MUCH FROM THE K. TO TWELVE COMMUNITY -- THAT TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH I KNOW THAT WHEN SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS CAME UP HERE THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR TOP ISSUES I THINK ABOUT THE CONNECTION IT HAS TO THE STUDENTS IN HIGHER ED -- THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THESE ARE CONNECTED AND SO I JUST WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE IMPACT THE SYSTEM -- MAKE WE CLEARLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I JUST DON'T. NO WHERE OR HOW -- AND IT'S NO DOUBT THATINVESTMENT OF FUNDS IS ONE APPROACH BUT I THINK. MORE BROADLY -- THINKING ABOUT% THE FACT THAT K. TWELVE IS ASKING US FOR THIS HIGHER AT IS ASKING US FOR THIS -- AND THE NEED IN THE GAP IS -- BECOMING MUCH GREATER [inaudible] THANK YOU. YEAH. THANK YOU AND AND I KNOW THAT THE OTHER GUARD SISTER SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT NEXT DOOR HERE SOMEONE. IS IS TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND THEY HAVE A LIST OF PROPOSALS AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPETE BUT I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE. FOCUSING ON ON BOTH POPULATIONS AND I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS. THAT THAT PROP SIXTY THREE THE SO CALLED MILLIONAIRE'S TAX WHEN IT WAS APPROVED. WAS GONNA BE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR NOW IT'S THREE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION FOR YEAH. SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY IN IT AND A LOT IS GOING OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN WE KNOW SOME COUNTIES ARMS SPENDING IT. AND TAKE IT YOU KNOW COULD SEE WITH THE SHOULD BE THEY COULD BE FOCUSING ON AS YOU SAID MISS SIMONE STUDENT ISSUES IN COLLEGE ISSUES AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON HERE IS THERE SOME MONEY THAT COMES TO THE STATE. WE NEED TO FOCUS HOW WE THINK OUR STATE PRIORITY SEND. THIS -- CERTAINLY -- IN MY VIEW SHOULD BE ONE BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WILL WILL ALSO LOOK AT THE OTHER PROPOSALS. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEST WHEN THERE'S NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM -- WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE -- OPEN AND TALK ABOUT IT AFTER THE MAY REVISE LESTAT FOLK REAL QUICK SORRY I KNOW WE HAVE SOME STUDENTS HERE WHO WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. ABOUT THIS SO THIS IS THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION -- FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO -- INCOME ON UP LINE UP OVER HERE. WESLEY SEXTET STUDENT IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE HI THERE MY NAME IS LONG BEEN SEALED I'M A STUDENT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL -- TO REMEMBER HOW THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE SUPPORT YOUR BILL TERM MCCARTY IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR LAND ASK STUDENTS. WHO FACE CERTAIN CHALLENGES JUST REMINDER ANYONE IS A STATE CORPORATIONS COMMITTEE BUT WE SUPPORT IDEA? AND CONCEPTS SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU BUT AGAIN -- THE BILL IS NOT RELEVANT IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION. I CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF MANY I'M DOCTOR IN WALTHAM COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MARITIME ACADEMY AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT BETTER MENTAL SERVICES ARE NEEDED. AND APPROPRIATIONS IN BILL -- SIX SIXTY WILL HELP CAL MERIT TIME I AM THE ONLY FULL TIME MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR IN MY PART TIME CALLING AND I SERVER THOUSAND CADETS IN OUR SCHEDULES ARE FULL. IRIVER LEAN STAYING LATE MOST DAYS YET THE MAJORITY OF MY CSU COLLEAGUES ARE EX CENTERS WITH AN AVERAGE OF ONE COUNSEL PER TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS SOME MORE. AND IT THIS TURNS COUNSELING CENTERS INTO CRISIS CENTERS. ME SAID AGAIN COUNSELING CENTERS ARE BECOMING CRISIS CENTERS. AND HIGH RISK STUDENTS ARE PRIORITIZE IT LEAVES OTHERS HANGING ON WAIT LISTS OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT OFTEN INACCESSIBLE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED TODAY -- AND I CAN SPEAK ALSO FROM DIFFERENT SPIRITS AS HAVING WORKED IN THE UC SYSTEM UC BERKELEY AS A COUNSELOR THERE AND IT FRESNO CITY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT -- I HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES LASTLY LET ME SAY THAT BASED ON DANIEL EISENBERG'S WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PURSUE MICHIGAN PROVIDING MENTAL SERVICES PAYS FOR ITSELF AND RETENTION INTUITION YOU CAN GO TO HIS WEBSITE AND USE THE CALCULATOR. EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTION CAN INPUT THEIR DATA AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH MONEY SPECIFICALLY THEY CAN SAVE WITH MORE COUNSELORS AND THAT'S WHAT -- IN THE CSU WE NEED AND THAT TWENTY MILLION AND MORE CAN GIVE CSU STUDENTS THE EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY A MICHAEL RITTER AND I'VE RETIRED TWO YEARS AGO FROM SAM'S CISCO STATE UNIVERSITY AFTER THIRTY YEARS AND COUNTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. SO DURING THAT TIME I SAW. THE THE MOUNTING PRESSURE THAT THE CENTER WAS UNDER IN AS HE SAID MY COLLEAGUE SAID. BECOMING MORE OF A CRISIS CENTER TRYING TO PUT OUT FIRES BUT THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DID NOT INCREASE DURING THAT TIME. IS SAN FRANCISCO STATE CURRENTLY. OF THE COUNSELING CENTER HAS LESS THAN HALF OF THE RECOMMENDED. NUMBER OF CANCER SO THERE'S BASICALLY TEN COUNSELORS FOR TWENTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS THE UNIVERSITY OF THE TIME. WAIT TIMES CAN BE TWO TO THREE WEEKS -- THE MOST VULNERABLE OF OUR STUDENTS FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TURNED AWAY WHEN WHEN SOMEONE SAYS. OUR NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT IS TWENTY DAYS OUT. FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR THE CHALLENGES. ARE EVEN MORE ACUTE AS A FACE ALL THE DISTAL STRESSORS SUCH AS DISCRIMINATION. IMMIGRATION STATUS FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS. STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO ATTEND THE NEEDED SERVICES AND THAT'S WHY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT FULL TIME MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS BE HIRED. THE REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE I ALSO LIKE TO ADD TO IT -- COLLEGE COUNSELING IS A UNIQUE SET OF SKILLS IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INTERCHANGEABLE -- SET OF SKILLS THAT DID THE PEOPLE WHO GO INTO THAT. VESTER FOCUS. THIS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS FOR THE DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. WHO KNOW THE COUNSELING CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STUDENT DROPPING OUT OFSCHOOL? GRADUATING. THESE DEDICATED PROFESSIONAL SKIP LUNCH SO THAT THEY CAN SEE A STUDENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A WAITING LIST THEY THEY PUT OFF PAPERWORK INTO IT AFTER HOURS SO THEY CAN SEE A STUDENT -- DURING THAT TIME KNOWING THAT THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE EQUALLY PRESSURED THANK YOU. OKAY. SO JUST WANT TO SAY I WANT TO SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FACT ASSOCIATIONS.

A BIG NON ACADEMIC BARRIER THAT STUDENTS DO FACE IS THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH A LOT OF STUDENTS ESPECIALLY I SAW ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE DROPPING OUT. DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THEY HAVE MENTALLY WITHIN THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT I KNOW THIS IS SENATE BILL SB SIX SIXTY WHICH WOULD BRING IN ONE MENTAL HEALTH COUNCIL FOR EVERY. FIFTEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS IN COLLEGES I THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING MENTAL HEALTH -- THESE TOWARDS OUR STUDENT BODY.

MODERATE TRAINING IN DEALING WITH A CRISIS -- THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU WANT TO LEAVE A STUDENT AT THE DOOR OF A COUNSELING CENTER. WHO IN CRISIS WITH SOMEONE WHO'S MODERATELY TRAINED IN CRISIS COUNSELING IT'S A VERY VERY REAL NEED -- SO I HOPE WE CAN SEE THAT -- MANIFEST IN THE IN THE COLLEGES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NEIL I'M A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY I JUST WANT TO STAND ON WITH THE NEED TO REALLY INVEST AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND MENTAL HEALTH. SO I'M ASKING THAT WE MAKE THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS AT THE WRIST YOU SEE RECEIVED. IN LIEU OF A STUDENT SERVICES FEE INCREASE PER MINUTE AND TO ALSO APPROVE A FIVE POINT THREE MILLION IN ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND THAT'S PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR SPECIFICALLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EXPANSION. AT THE UC FOR CONTACTS IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH THE ADVOCACY OF STUDENTS AND THE HIGHLIGHTING OF SIGNIFICAN INSTITUTIONAL LIKE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THE UC BEGAN A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO FUNDS FOR FUNDS TO HIRE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FIVE CLINICIANS. ACROSS THE SYSTEM TO EXPAND ITS COUNSELING SERVICES AND REDUCE THE STUDENT A COUNSELOR RATIO. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS EXPANSION THE UC RECEIVED A ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO THE STATE TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. HOWEVER THE ONE TIME FUNDING FELL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ONGOING COST OF ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS NOR DID ACCOUNT FOR THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO CONTINUE AND FINISH THE EXPANSION. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE NEWLY HIRED COUNSELORS AND AVOID RAISING TUITION FOR AT THE STATE MUST MAKE A PERMANENT MUST MAKE PERMANENT THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION AND ALSO INCLUDE A FIVE POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING FUNDING. WITH OVER ONE IN FOUR STUDENTS DEALING WITH SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS ANXIETY RECENTLY BEING CLAIMED AS AN EPIDEMIC ACROSS COLLEGE CAMPUSES. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE IN A TRIPLING OF ANXIETY IN THE LEVEL AMONG YOU SEE STUDENTS OVER THE PAST DECADE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT. ON THAT THIS HAS HONOR STUDENTS IN THEIR LIVELIHOOD THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S LOCAL NOW NEWMAN ALSO STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY OF A SECOND HERE -- AND PURSUING PUBLIC HEALTH AND BIO EASY AND I FEEL AS IF LIKE I WANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE WIPING MENTAL HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT WHY WE SHOULD SUSTAIN IT HERE AT THE UC'S. AND OTHER SCHOOLS AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'M OUT OF STATE STUDENT AND I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO CAL ON OTHER REGIONS AND CHANCE OR SCHOLARSHIP. SO LIKE I WAS PROMISED THAT I WOULD COME HERE AND I'D BE UPLIFTED AS LIKE A TOP RECRUITED STUDENT. BY FALL AS IF LIKE JUST FOR THE RESOURCES LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN SUPPORTED NECESSARILY LIKE. IN MY FIRST YEAR HERE UNDER WHAT LIKE TO MATIC EXPERIENCES AND I FELT LIKE IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO GET THAT CARE. AND ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO LIKE BRING TO THE FOREFRONT IS THE FACT THAT LIKE A LOT OF UC BERKELEY STUDENTS IF THEY WANT TO RECEIVE CARE IT TAKES UP TO LIKE. TWO TO TWO WEEKS TO A MONTH TO GET LAKE SCENE AND THEN ALSO WE'RE STRUGGLING ON CAMPUS WITH. ACCESS TO A DIVERSE BY COUNSELORS AND THAT INCLUDES LIKE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE -- SOCIO ECONOMICALLY INTERFAITH -- AND ALSO BY SEXUAL ORIENTATION HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MANIFEST IN A LOT OF STUDENTS FEELING AS IF THEY CANNOT. PROCEED WITH THE SCHOOLING AT THE SCHOOL AND ALSO DROPPING OUT -- I BELIEVE LIKE IT'S ALSO INTERESTING BECAUSELIKE A KEY WORD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE BRING UP NOW IT'S LIKE THIS IDEA OF LIKE INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE BUT THE WAY IN WHICH WE DO THAT IS TO LIKE ACADEMIC EQUITY RIGHT. BUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT STUDENTS BASED ON OUR CAMPUS OR LIKE NOT LIKE -- EXCLUSIVE LIKE WE HAVE WHAT TO STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS WE HAVE LOTS OF STUDENTS WHO LACK BASIC ACCESS TO LIKE FOOD AND NUTRITION. AND THOSE THINGS ALL CULMINATE IN THE FACT THAT LIKE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS BEING IMPACTED AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS BIGGER QUESTION OF LIKE. HOW CAN STUDENTS GO ABOUT LIKE GETTING ACCESS TO LIKE THIS TOP NOTCH EDUCATION IF THEY'RE WORRYING ABOUT LIKE SMALLER ISSUES -- I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT LIKE AT UC BERKELEY THE BLACK POPULATION IS ONE POINT 9%. AND WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF STUDENTS DROP OUT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GO AND BE SEEN FOR LIKE OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES THAT THEY MAY HAVE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT MY TWO EYES IDENTITIES TO CALM WITH LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TRAUMAS IN LIKE THEY NEED TO BE A DRASTIC LIKE IF THEY'RE NOT HELPED THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO DROP OUT OUR RETENTION RATES ARE VERY LOW. AND A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS THE NECESSARY STOP BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT TAKEN A WE SEE OUR OUR RATES GOING DOWN TO LIKE. ZERO NUMBERS -- ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY. I'M ASSET WRAP IT UP WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ONE MINUTES OUR STUDENTS ON BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE GENEROUS BUT OF COURSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGIE CHEN ON THE SENIOR AT UC BERKELEY -- WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ONE IN EVERY EIGHT YOU SEE STUDENTS USE AND COUNSELING SERVICES BUT YOU KNOW AT THE TING CENTER ON CAMPUS AT UC BERKELEY WAIT TIMES GETTING LONGER LONGER THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM -- AND I WORK A LOT ON BASIC NEEDS PARTICULARLY HOUSING AND SECURITY I WORK WITH LIKE -- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT YEAH YOU SEE BURKE AT THE CITY OF BERKELEY TO ADDRESS YOU DON'T RISING HOUSING COSTS AND YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF RISING HOUSING COSTS BECAUSE OF HIGH TUITION WAS A COMPETITIVE ACADEMICS. AND THESE ARE ALL FACTORS THAT WILL IMPACT OUR MENTAL HEALTH BY INCREASING OUR STRESS AND ANXIETY AND SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS BY YOU KNOW FUNDING SERVICES THAT HELP STUDENTS NAVIGATE. THIS AND ACHIEVE THE SUCCESS IN THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS SO WE NEED TO MAKE PERMANENT THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT WAS USED TO HIRE CANCERS AND NOW WE NEED TO USE THAT TO MAINTAIN THE COUNTERS THERE. AND WE NEED TO APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST OF FOUR FIVE POINT THREE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT IMPACTS EVERY SINGLE STUDENT ON EVERY SINGLE YOU SEE CAMPUS THANK THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SAID IN A TELEPHONE THEN I GO TO UC BERKELEY'S WHILE I'M A SOPHOMORE -- AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIORITIZING MENTALHEALTH -- ESPECIALLY AT UC BERKELEY THE CLIMB IT AND LIKE LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY REALLY DO. A PLAY A TOLL ON A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY AND MYSELF SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN -- GET A SMALLER RATIO OF COUNSELORS TO STUDENTS BECAUSE IT'S RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO WAIT MORE THAN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK IN AND pYOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ISSUES -- I ALSO WANT TO SEE MENTION HOW ONE IN FOR OVER ONE IN FOUR STUDENTS ARE DEALING WITH SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS SPECIFICALLY I CAN SPEAK ON LIKE BEING A LOT THE KNOCK. IN HIGHER ED LIKE FROM BACK HOME LIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESSES AND IT'S SO STIGMATIZED AND IF I'M GOING TO UNIVERSITY LIKE I WANT TO HAVE ACCESS. TO DIVERSE -- COUNSELORS I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE SERVICES PROVIDED TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS BEFORE -- SO THAT'S WHY I MERGING THE UC TO MAKE THE ONE TIME FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS THAT THE UC RECEIVED IN LIEU OF A STUDENT SERVICES FEE INCREASE IN.

HI MY NAME IS JACKIE MY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME SPEAK -- I AM ALSO A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY I'M A SECOND YEAR AND I STUDY PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUT ON PUBLIC POLICY -- MOST IMPORTANTLY I'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD SINCE THE START OF MY COLLEGE CAREER WORKING ON TO WORKING ON IMPROVING STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE IN THAT SO SHE GETS INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OUR SENIOR GOVERNMENT. BUT ALSO I'M A RESIDENT ASSISTANT IN IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO COLLEGE AND YOU REMEMBER LIKE. LIVING IN THE RESIDENCE HALLS YOU REMEMBER YOUR ARE A BEING ABOUT ONE PERSON THAT WOULD HELP STUDENTS -- HELP GIVE STUDENTS ADVICE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I REALIZE THAT MY ROLE AS AN ARE A THIS YEAR WAS REALLY TRYING TO MEDIATE A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THE THAT OUR UNIVERSITY HAS SINCE BE OUTPACING THIS YEAR. AND IT'S JUST COINCIDENTAL THAT I'M SPEAKING TODAY BECAUSE JUST LAST WEEK I HOW TO DEAL WITH THE CASE -- REGARDING SUICIDE IDEATION AND I'M STILL TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF AFTER DEALING WITH THAT AND JUST THIS PAST MONTH FIVE OF MY RESIDENTS ON MY FLOOR SIXTY SIX STUDENTS HAVE ALL ASKED ME HOW TO ACCESS. COUNTING RESOURCES OUT OUR LOCAL UNIVERSITY HEALTH SERVICES TAKE CENTER AND CONSISTENTLY ONE AFTER THE OTHER FIVE OF THE FIVE STUDENTS HAVE ALL MENTIONED THAT IT TOOK THEM TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO REACH A COUNSELOR. THERE'S CLEARLY AN OVERSATURATION OF STUDENTS TRYING TO ACCESS THESE COUNSELING RESOURCES AND WE CAN WE NEED FUNDING -- TO TO CONTINUE THE SERVICE SAYS -- I'D REALLY LIKE TO ADD THAT -- I COULD HAVE A KINGS IDEAS THE X. AS IT'S AN INCREASING EPIDEMIC ON OUR CAMPUS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OUR COLLEGES SO RIGOROUS AND FOR THAT. THOSE WHO NEED THOUGHT -- ARE -- YEAH IT'S REALLY POINT THAT WE DO INCREASE FUNDING BECAUSE THESE RESOURCES ARE REALLY NECESSARY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON -- GENRE THE UC TION ASSOCIATION -- WE HAVE OUR EYES AND I SEE A LOT OF THE FORCE OF SHARES -- THE SAME ASKS THAT WE NEED -- THE CONTINUED FUNDING TO FIVE POINT THREE MILLION HOW TO EXPAND THE SERVICES AND ALSO THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME TO TURN INTO ONGOING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR THE TRAJECTORY THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I DO WANT TO KIND OF SHARE FOR A MOMENT I THINK WE QUITE OFTEN THINK ABOUT THESE AS NUMBERS AND AS YOU KNOW STILL LIKE LITERAL. BUT NOT NOT REALLY AS HUMAN BEINGS AND AND HE WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO AT A DAY LIKE THIS ONE AS A FIRST YEAR STUDENT I WAS WALKING AND I SAW. THE BREAK HIS NUMBER AROUND -- ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE AT UC IRVINE. AND AND I REMEMBER THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME. THAT THAT AFFECTS SO MANY THAT I SAW HAPPEN IN MY TIME AND EVERY TIME TO DAYTHAT I YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT THIS AND I I START TO SHAKE BECAUSE I THINK -- FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT THAT -- SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM WHEN THEY COMMIT SUICIDE OR GOD FORBID -- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ON US YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T FIND THESE FALSE IF WE CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS OFTENTIMES WE THINK ABOUT EFFICIENCY WE THINK ABOUT. WHAT MAKES SENSE WITHIN LIMITED RESOURCES THESE ARE LIVES AND WE CAN'T THINK OF THEM AS? WHAT MAKES SENSE WE ONLY CAN DO WHAT KEEPS THEM ALIVE SITE I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO GIVE US THIS FUNDING BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY? AND SORRY FOR THE SAKE THAT IT SHOULD WAS TRIGGERING TO FOLKS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY ON THIS ISSUE AGAIN WE'RE GONNA TRY TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY. WITH OUR FINAL BUDGET ACTION LET'S GO NOW TO THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA AGENDA ITEMS THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE CAN ADDRESS A FEW WEEKS AGO READ -- TIME. SO ISSUE NUMBER. TWO PERATIONAL COSTS. UNDER NINETEEN MILLION ONGOING FUNDING TO ADDRESS YOU SEE OPERATIONAL COSTS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON JACK'S WALTER AND FINANCE -- AS WE DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING. FULL YOU SEE PACKAGE FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS WINTER NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. TO ORDER MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION -- THE WHICH IS ON GOING. OF THIS TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION IS FOR CONTRACTUALLY CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED COMPENSATION. NON SELLER PRICE INCREASES ANOTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS -- THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL OPERATIONAL DEMANDS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH OTHER RESOURCES TO MEET STATE GOALS -- AND YEAH A LOT OF THIS INVESTMENT THE ADMINISTRATION SIGNALED ITS INTENTION THAT YOU SEE KEEP ITS TUITIONFLAT IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE ARE -- GLAD TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENT PAUL TANA THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE ON SHORT AND LONG TERM INITIATIVES TO PROVIDE FISCAL STIR CERTAIN. STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES INCREASED ACCESS IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS GREAT MORE COST EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IMPROVE THE LINK BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE SKILLS IF THE ECONOMY BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LA -- DECENT CONCENTRATE SOLELY -- REGARDING THIS SPECIFIC ITEM IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA IT HAS A TABLE THAT BREAKS OUT HOW YOU SEE WOULD SPEND THE PROPOSED A HUNDRD TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT LIST YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS ROUGHLY INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE FIRST YOU CAN THINK OF IS. WHAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER BASIC COST INCREASES THAT THE UNIVERSITY ENCOURAGE EACH YEAR? THINGS LIKE PENSION COST INCREASES BENEFIT COST INCREASES EQUIPMENT COST INCREASES. WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THESE. ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES HERE. THE SECOND AREA -- IN THIS LIST IS WHAT YOU COULD CALL COMPENSATION AND THIS IS -- SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES EVERY YEAR. HOW MUCH IN SALARIES INCREASE FOR EMPLOYEES FACULTY AND STAFF EACH YEAR? AND USUALLY LEGISLATURE WOULD CONSIDER THINGS LIKE RICK -- RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ISSUES HOW WELL THE UNIVERSITY IS. WORKING IN EACH OF THE FOR EACH OF ITS EMPLOYEES GROUPS. WELL ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE HERE THAT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN SAY THE WAY THE GOVERNOR'S TREATING CSU. IS THE GOVERNOR'S EXPLICITLY FUNDING. SALARY INCREASES. FOR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF COURSE FUNDED EMPLOYEES THAT YOU SEE THERE MEANING TWO THIRDS OF A OF YOU SEE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT ARE NOT. A NON REPRESENTED. AND A FOR SOME CONTACTS THAT INCLUDES ALL TEN YEAR TENURE TRACK FACULTY. AND ALSO INCLUDES A MOST ADMINISTRATIVE COURT FUNDED MINISTRY TO STAFF THAT YOU SEE YOU. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS IDENTIFIED -- VARIOUS NON STATE RESOURCES IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING THAT IT ALSO INCLUDED IN ITS -- BUDGET% PLANS AND COULD BE AVAILABLE TO COVER ONGOING COSTS IT'S REASONABLE THAT YOU WOULD. FACTOR THOSE INTO YOUR BUDGET DECISIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERM MCCARTY A MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M SAY EVER TENANT AND I'LL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ON SLIDE TWO OF MY PRESENTATION THAT THE SERGEANT JUST HANDED OUT. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET REQUEST IS CENTERED AROUND THE REGION'S MULTI YEAR PLAN WHICH AIMS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF YOU SEE DEGREES AWARDED BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BY. TWENTY THIRTY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S MULTI YEAR PLAN FUNDING MODEL HAS THREE AREAS OF FOCUS SUSTAINING OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS FUNDING GROWTH AND FACULTY STUDENTS AND PROGRAMS. AND ADDRESSING CAPITAL NEEDS AND THIS NEXT ITEM WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE SUSTAINING OF CURRENT OPERATIONS. AS A BRIEF REMINDER ON SLIDE THREE YOU'LL SHEET YOU'LL SEE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE WHICH WE ARE REQUESTING THAT YOU SUPPORT FOR US -- THAT INCLUDES THE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH THAT YOU JUST HEARD EXTENSIVELY UP REGARDING -- ON SLIDE FOR IS THE ONE TIME FUNDS PROPOSED FOR THE UNIVERSITY BY THE GOVERNOR AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT HE RECOGNIZES THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THE UNIVERSITY'S ROLE IN IT A NEW DEGREE COMPLETION EFFORTS AND WILL DISCUSS BOTH OF THOSE LATER IN THIS HEARING -- THE UNIVERSITY IS REQUESTED THIS COMMITTEE IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED TO US AS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THREE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT IS STEVE FIRST ITEM ON THAT SLIDE -- IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED ONE TIME FUNDS FOR TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BE BUYOUT. AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES THAT WE OVER AND ROLLED BY AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS FUNDING IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE PROVIDED THESE DOES NINETY FIVE MILLION TO US AS PERMITTED FUNDING BECAUSE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THE ROLE OF A TUITION BY OUT. AS AN ON GOING SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY -- ALSO THIS NINETY FIVE MILLION -- INCLUDED THE STUDENT SERVICES BE BY OUT OF THE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT WE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING EARLIER -- UNFORTUNATELY IN THE LATE STAGES OF THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS THE NINETY FIVE MILLION WAS MADE ONE TIME FUNDING. AND WE'RE HERE NOW REQUESTING THAT IT BE MADE PERMANENT -- SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ALL THE SERVICES THAT HOW START BEEN STARTED FORTY STUDENTS WITH THE SPENDING. ON SLIDE SIX YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THOSE -- SERVICES THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- HAD THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH THIS NINETY FIVE MILLION THIS INCLUDES HIRING FOURTEEN LETTERING FACULTY. AT UC RIVERSIDE AND SEVENTEEN NEW LOT AROUND FACULTY AT UCLA WE SPENT OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION ON NEW LECTURES A NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS INSTRUCTORS. EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF COURSES ON CAMPUSES SO THAT STUDENTS CAN. STUDENTS CAN GET THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MATTER. SOME OF THE FUNDS WERE SPENT ON LIBRARY SERVICES -- ON STUDENT ADVISORS -- TITLE NINE SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL VIOLENCE COORDINATORS -- ON MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE UNIVERSITY'S OPERATIONS AND WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU CONTINUE THIS FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY SO WE CAN SUSTAIN THOSE OPERATIONS. THEN SLIDE SEVEN CONTINUES THE DISCUSSION OF COSTS FOR OUR CURRENT COME CAMPUS OPERATIONS THESE WERE TOUCHED ON ALREADY BY THE LA -- AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT FIRST HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT HE RECOGNIZES. THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS MANDATORY COST INCREASES IN LABOR RETIREMENT AND HEALTH THAT MUST BE MET -- THESE MANDATORY COST MAY SEEM LIKE A VERY LARGE INCREASE -- WHEN COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF OTHER STATE AGENCIES BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS IN REGARDS TO UNIVERSITIES THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET? THIS ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A 3% INCREASE IN COSTS WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY IN LINE WITH INFLATION. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE ITEMS -- I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NOT RECEIVING THE TWO HUNDRED UP TO NINETY FIVE MILLION FROM THE CURRENT YEAR WILL. IF WE DON'T RECEIVE THAT PERMANENTLY IT WILL EAT INTO THE UNIVERSITY'S ABILITY TO COVER THESE COSTS. TO THE POINT THAT ALTHOUGH WE'RE RECEIVING TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION ONCE THE MANDATORY COST SHOWN HERE AND THE PROP FIFTY SIX OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBTRACTED. THE NINETY FIVE MILLION THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT SOME OPERATIONAL REDUCTIONS IN ORDER -- TO UP AHEAD INTO NINETEEN TWENTY IF WE DON'T RECEIVE THAT NINETY FIVE PERMANENTLY. OTHER HIGH PRIORITY COST YOU SEE INCLUDED ON THIS PAGE INCLUDE FACULTY COMPENSATION STAFF COMPENSATION AND CAPITAL OF LATE DEBT SERVICE AND ALL DISCUSS THE CAPITAL OUTLAY LATER. IN THIS HEARING ISSUES. SIX THE STAFF COMPENSATION PROPOSAL IS FOR FORTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- AND REPRESENTS A 3% SALARY INCREASE FOR UC'S NON REPRESENTED STAFF. I IN FOUR OF THE PAST TEN YEARS YOU SEE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE STAFF SALARY INCREASE PROGRAM FOR THE ON REPRESENTS STAFF. AND OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE AVERAGE ANNUAL BUDGET INCREASE FOR STAFF SALARIES WITH ABOUT ONE POINT 8%. ANNUALLY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM -- OTHER STATE AGENCIES DURING THIS TIME HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE A 225% SALARY INCREASES ANNUALLY -- AND NEXT SLIDE I WILL DISCUSS THE COMPONENTS OF THE FACULTY SALARY INCREASE OF WE'RE PROPOSING ON SLIDE EIGHT YOU'LL SEE SOME FACTS. ABOUT WHY WE WANT TO INCREASE OUR FACULTY SALARIES. THE FACULTY SALARY COMPENSATION TO NINETY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION INCLUDES THREE PARTS. THERE'S THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FACULTY MERIT INCREASES. THAT REFERS OF FACULTY PERFORMANCE REVIEW WHERE FACULTY ARE PROMOTED EITHER FROM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR TO AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OR FROM AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR TO A FULL PROFESSOR OR THEY MOVE UP IN -- SALARY STEPS WITH IN THOSE RANKS AND THERE ARE RANKED BASED ON PERFORMANCE OF HOW MUCH THEY PUBLISH HOW MANY COURSES THEY TEACH AND SO FORTH THAT THEY IF THEY MEET THOSE CRITERIA THEY CAN MOVE UP IN THEIR STEPS OF PAY. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THAT WILL COST APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS COMING YEAR. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE FACULTY MERITS ANNUALLY BECAUSE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE WE LOST THE CASE IN SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT -- DUE TO TRYING -- TO IT AND THE FACULTY MERIT PROGRAM ONE YEAR DUE TO BUDGET CONCERNS AND THE COURT FOUND THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE. TO DENY FACULTY THEIR REVIEWS DUE TO BUDGETARY CONCERNS. OF THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE FACULTY COMPENSATION PIECES OF FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND AN AVERAGE FACULTY SALARY INCREASE OF 3% FOR ALL. A LOT OF RANK FACULTY IN THE UNIVERSITY. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING ANOTHER THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION FOUR SEPARATE SALARY PROGRAM IS PART OF A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO CLOSE TO UNIVERSITIES LOT OF RANK FACULTY SALARY GAP. WITH OUR COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS OVER TIME AND ON SLIDE EIGHT YOU'LL SEE THAT -- WHERE THE UNIVERSITY SALARIES ARE ARE BELOW -- WHERE ARE COMPARISON INSTITUTES CURRENTLY ARE WHERE ABOUT SIX POINT 7% BELOW ON SLIDE? EIGHT YOU WILL SEE A CHART THAT SHOWS THAT -- WHERE SIX POINT SEVEN BELOW ARE COMPARISON INSTITUTES -- WHEN FACULTY LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN OUT OF TWENTY LEE FOR PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES WHICH IS WHY WE DO THINK THAT COMPARING OURSELVES TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS CONTINUES TO BE A RELEVANT METRIC -- UC'S COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS WERE SELECTED AFTER AN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION WITH THE LA -- AND THE NOW DEFUNCT C. PACK THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS THERE MAY BE -- SOME -- REASON MAYBE TO GO BACK AND RE EXAMINE THOSE AT SOME POINT BUT THERE CURRENTLY ARE THE BEST THAT -- METRIC THAT WE DO HAVE. THERE WAS A NINETY TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT AMONG OUR FACULTY MEMBERS WHO LEFT YOU SEE FOR ANOTHER INSTITUTION. SALARY WAS THE MOST OFTEN CITED REASON. SALARY WAS ALL THIS IS ALSO THE SECOND MOST CITED REASON AMONG THOSE WHO DECIDED TO REMAIN AT UC. 91% OF WHOM RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL SALARY IN THE RETENTION OFFER. SO WE DO FIND THAT OUT TO SALARY OFFERS MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE FACULTY I THE REMAINING WITH US OR LEAVING US FOR ANOTHER INSTITUTION. AND THAT CONCLUDE MY OPERATIONAL COMPONENT OPERATIONS COST -- PRESENTATION -- A ANY QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU. I'D LIKE. TO KNOW FIRST GAS THE LA -- AND THEN -- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. TO TO RESPOND BUT I I SEE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON THE ISSUE OF OF FACULTY. SALARIES AND COMPETITIVENESS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE LA -- DOES KNOW THAT SOME DATA SUGGESTS. YOU SEE IS COMPETITIVE IN RECRUITING FACULTY AND THAT SEEMS TO BE. CONTRADICTED BY THE UC'S REPRESENTED COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. SURE SO I'M. YOU SEE USED TO COMPREHENSIVELY GATHER DATA ON RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF FACULTY -- THEY INDICATE THA THAT SYSTEM Y. DATA OR IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE BUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE DATA THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND WE FOUND THAT THE UNIVERSITY WAS SUCCESSFULLY -- RECRUITING AND RETAINING FACULTY WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES BECAUSE THAT DOES THE SEVERAL YEARS OLD -- YOU KNOW THINGS CAN CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND SO WE DON'T HAVE. ANY UPDATED DATA TO REALLY PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE'S TECH TO GUIDE YOU ON THE ON THOSE DATA. THE ONE EVIDENCE WE DO HAVE HIS. SALARY COMPARISONS. NUMBER COMES A SALARY COMPARISONS THE THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS -- WHO DOES THE LEGISLATURE WANT YOU SEE TO COMPETE AGAINST? THE ORIGINAL COMPARISON EAT INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU SEE -- COMPARES ITSELF TO ON PAGE AIDS AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S A SELECT GROUP OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. THAT INCLUDES -- A FEW OF KEY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT EACH STATE -- AND ALSO INCLUDES A FEW VERY SELECTIVE -- AN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. ALTERNATIVELY IN THE IN THE PAST WE'VE COMPARED UC FACULTY SALARIES TO A BROADER GROUP OF PUBLIC HI RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. ABOUT SEVENTY OF THOSE ACROSS THE NATION. WE FIND THAT YOU SEE FACULTY ARE ARE PAID A ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF THOSE OTHER INSTITUTIONS OTHERS ARE MOSTLY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND PART OF WHAT DRIVES UP THE COMPARISON EIGHT COMPARISON OR THESE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS LIKE HARVARD MIT. AND SO THAT'S SORT OF THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S I DOESN'T WANT YOU SEE TO COMPETE AS A AS AN ENTIRE SYSTEM AGAINST -- THESE SELECT NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS AS A WANT TO LOOK AT A BROADER NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS BUT TO KEEP. ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES EACH YEAR -- I DON'T HAVE THE MOST RECENT DATA ON OUR RECRUITMENT OF FACULTY -- I WOULD POINT TO SOME OF THE RETENTION DATA IN THIS WE RECRUIT A LOT OF VERY YOUNG TALENTED FACULTY AND WE OFFER IN ADDITION TO THEIR SALARY WELL FOR THEM WHAT'S CALLED START UP. WHICH IS -- SOMETIMES LABORATORY RENOVATIONS SOMETIMES ITS INITIAL RESEARCH FUNDING AND SO FORTH -- THOSE CAN BE VERY ENTICING TO A YOUNG FACULTY HARKENING STARTED IN THEIR CAREERS -- BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WERE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEM ONCE THEY'RE PAST THAT INITIAL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR LEVEL -- THAT WE HAVE YOUNG EXPRESSION WE FACULTY FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY BACKGROUNDS. TEND TO GET OFF ONCE THEY SHOW HOW GREAT THEY ARE AND THEY'RE DOING ALL THEIR PUBLISHING -- OTHER UNIVERSITIES BEGIN TO RECRUIT THEM QUITE AGGRESSIVELY AND WE ARE FINDING THAT WHEN WE OFFERED THEM HIGHER PAY. THAT GETS MANY OF THEM TO STAY WITH US THEY WANT TO BE AT YOU SEE BECAUSE OF OUR PUBLIC MISSION. BECAUSE OF OUR HIGHLY TALENTED WE OFFERED THEM HIGHLY TALENTED COLLEAGUES -- AND ALSO CALIFORNIA IS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO BE SO -- THEY WANT TO BE HERE BUT WE ARE FINDING THAT -- RETENTION IS AN ISSUE I DON BUT I DON'T HAVE THE DATA ON HOW MANY OFFERS WE INITIALLY MAKE THEM ARE REJECTED -- WE DO FIND THAT -- A LOT OF OUR FACULTY LEAVE FOR OTHER HIGH PAYING INSTITUTIONS WE DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE COMPARED --TO JUST ANY RESEARCH INSTITUTION OR JUST ANY PUBLIC INSTITUTION BECAUSE OF OUR FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE PUBLIC -- PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE FACULTY HAVE. ME -- TOO PAYMENT MISTER CHAIRMAN I I I WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT -- YOU KNOW IT -- THE COMMISSION ALSO SEND AND TO CREATE A INDICATES A LEE SAID. THAT THE THAT THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT THAT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSESSMENT THAT NON REPRESENTED FACULTY INCREASES CAN CAN BE CONSIDER OPTIONAL BUT BUT BUT AND AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SEEMS TO BE. FOCUSING ON THE REPRESENTED. EMPLOYEES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AND I I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO CAL. THE THE THE THE REPUTATION OF THE UNIVERSITY WAS NOT. BASED ON THE UNDERGRADUATE WAS BASED ON THE FACULTY AND AND AND THE ABILITY -- TO TO RECRUIT INTO INTO -- KEEP I AM MEMBER THERE WAS ALWAYS THERE. THE YOU KNOW THE THE WHEN THE MOST -- THE PROUDEST THINGS THAT THAT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD ALWAYS TELL WAS A NUMBER OF NOBEL PRIZE -- WINNERS IT WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND I I WOULD THINK THAT IN ORDER. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP. AND AND AND PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BRAND THAT THAT WE NEED. TO YOU KNOW PRIORITIZE -- SPECIALLY FACULTY SALARIES -- NOW HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW I I I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN COMPETE WITH INSTITUTIONS LIKE HARVARD STANFORD AND YELL AND IN TERMS OF THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR MASSIVE AND TALENTS I MEAN A YOU KNOW LIKE -- IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S AN EASY WAY -- TO TO SKEW -- GOD -- COMPENSATION -- GUY COMPARISON -- BUT YEAH HI I JUST WANTED. TO HIGHLIGHT OR OUR FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF OF COMPETITIVE FACULTY SALARIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. IN A WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE THE COUNTRY'S BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. YEAH I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS ONE IT'S I THINK WITH THE UNIVERSITY IT'S A LARGE INSTITUTION SO IT'S YOU KNOW EQUITY SISTER FACULTY BUT ALSO. THE RANK AND FILE INDIVIDUALS. TO HELP KEEP THE UNIVERSITY -- RUNNING I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL WE TAKE CARE OF THEIR SALARY NEEDS BECAUSE YEAH COST TO RENT BECAUSE THE FOOD IS THE SAME PER FOR IT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR WAY LOWER ON THE ON THE PAY SCALE THAT BEING SAID YEAH WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. WE DON'T. LOSE -- FACULTY TO OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND AND PIRATES OF COURSE IT'S ALL YOU KNOW BALANCING ACTS SO WE'RE TRYING. TO BALANCE OUR PRIORITIES -- THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER GALLAGHER. YES SO I THOUGHT I JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH A FEW THINGS HERE -- YOU KNOW WE START WITH YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT PROVIDES -- TWO OR FORTY MILLION OF ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND -- MAN ON TOP OF THAT A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION ONE TIME -- PLEASE FIFTEEN MILLION OF THAT IS FOR DEGREE COMPLETION EFFORTS IT AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT USING THE UC EXTENSION IS IS. REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GET OUT THERE AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THAT TWO MORE ISSUES RIGHT AND AND SO YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'LL GET TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW SO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I THINK WE CAN DO. SOME RE WORKING THERE I THINK THERE WAS ALSO WAS IT FIFTY MILLION. FOR COMPLETING A FOUR YEARS WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WITH THAT IS REALLY IN THE CSU AND I WONDER IF MONEY IS ACTUALLY. BETTER SPENT THERE BUT GETTING TO SO YOU SEE REQUEST. ON TOP OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY PROPOSED WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT SUM. A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS -- YOU KNOW. SOME OF WHICH AS I SEE THE NEED -- FOR YEAH BUT I BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW PORT A PORTION OF THIS FORTY POINT THREE TWO AND ROLLED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE UNDERGRADUATES IN A THOUSAND MORE GRADUATE STUDENTS. AGAIN ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD AS WE DON'T YOU GUYS DON'T TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'RE IN ROLLING. WE GET THOSE NUMBERS AFTER THE FACT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW MUCH THAT NUMBER'S GOING TO CHANGE. AND THEN AGAIN I I I SEE THAT THE CSU ACTUALLY PROVIDES. HAS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL PROVIDE MORE MOMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATES -- AND WITHOUT HAVING REALLY DEFINED NUMBERS -- FROM YOU GUYS AND NOT GET IN AFTER THE FACT I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE ADDING ANOTHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO THEIR BUDGET JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY SAY RIGHT -- YOU KNOW FUNDS TO SUPPORT FACULTY NOW LOOK -- I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO KEEP A RETAIN -- FACULTY -- I THINK UNFORTUNATELY AS MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM THE FROM THE SOUTH BAY HAS -- HAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD I THINK A REALLY HIGH LEVEL. FACULTY -- QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE STANDARDS HAVE CHANGED -- AND RIGHT NOW I KNOW YOU EMPLOY PROFESSOR UC BERKELEY THE CALLS FOR THE UC DAVIS SORRY I DON'T WANT TO BE SMART BERKELEY -- BUT UC DAVIS WHO CALLS FOR THE KILLING OF COPS. AND WHOSE SPECIALTY IS IN CRISIS THEORY AND THE END OF CAPITALISM -- HIS LATEST BOOK IS RYAN STRIKE RYAN. I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT OUR STANDARDS OF FACULTY HAS. GROSSLY DEPLETED AT THE UC SYSTEM -- AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW I'M SURE THERE'S MANY GREAT FACULTY. AT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BUT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT VERY -- DISCERNING IN WHO THEY HIRE AND AND THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE. FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIANS IN THIS STATE SO NO I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE SIGN A BLANK CHECK OR WILL IN THIS CASE NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FACULTY INCREASES UNTIL I SEE. A MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION AT UC. YOU KNOW AND AGAIN IT IT JUST GOES ON ON AS MORE HEY. MOST OF THESE CONTRACTS MOST OF THESE COSTS YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES ARE IN THE PLACE TO NEGOTIATE. NOT THE PEOPLE UP HERE YOU NEGOTIATE WITH WITH YOUR FACULTY AND STAFF OVER PENSION BENEFITS OVER HEALTH BENEFITS OF ALL THOSE PREMIUMS. SO YOU NEGOTIATED AND THEN YOU COME TO US AND SAY PAY THE BILL. I MEAN TO ME THAT'S TOTALLY BACKWARDS YEAH -- AND YOU KNOW LOOK. WHEN YOU MAKE THESE PLANS IN ADVANCE I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY ALWAYS KNOW THAT THE MONEY WILL BE HERE BECAUSE WE KEEP GIVING THEM THE MONEY? AND LET ME GET TO MY FINAL POINT WHICH IS THEY STILL ARE NOT MEETING THE OBJECTIVES FOR FOR ENROLLING IN STATE STUDENTS WHICH THIS IS A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS THAT BERKELEY AT UCLA THERE'S STILL NOT MEETING. THEIR STANDARDS AND THEY'RE BRINGING IN OUT OF STATE STUDENTS WHY BECAUSETHERE'S ANOTHER BANKROLL OF MONEY THAT THEY CAN RELY ON YOU KNOW. FOR WHATEVER THEY CAN'T GET FROM US THEY'RE GETTING FROM OUT OF STATE STUDENT MOMENTS AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO THIS SO. SO NO I'M NOT REALLY INCLINED TO DISCO OKAY HERE'S ANOTHER HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THERE WE'VE ALREADY PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- DEFINITELY WANT TO LOOK AT HEY HOW DO WE SHOULD SOME OF THESE MONIES AROUND SO WE GET THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK. AND BY THE WAY WE JUST HEARD FROM ALL THE STUDENTS. WHO ARE SAYING YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED? AND NOW YOU WANT US TO PROVIDE YOU MORE MONEY TO TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT YOU HAVE THERE AND YOU'RE ALREADY NOT PROVIDING. FOR THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE IN IN MANY DIFFERENT INSTANCES HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH. EXCEPT FOR A YOU KNOW AND YOU KEEP AND YOU ALSO. BY THE WAY THE THIRD PART OF MONEY THAT YOU LIKE TO GO -- TO TUITION RIGHT WHICH CONTINUES A SPIKE AND THAT WE BOARDED OFF ONLY BY GIVING YOU BY THE THREAT OF YOU GUYS SAYING IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY. WE'RE GONNA RAISE TUITION ON THESE POOR STUDENTS WHO ALREADY PAYING THE HIGHEST. TUITION COSTS AROUND -- NOT TO MENTION THEN WE COMPARED OTHER UNIVERSITIES RAY AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE ACTUALLY WERE REALLY IN LINE WITH FACULTY SALARIES -- BUT YOU LIKE TO COMPARE YOU LIKE. TO USE THE COMPARISON THAT YOU WANT TO USE. FOR YOUR PURPOSES SO THAT YOU CAN GET MORE MONEY -- SO THAT YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THESE REAL HIGH LEVEL FACULTY THAT WE NEED TO RETAIN. WELL I'VE SENIOR FACULTY OKAY. AYE AYE WE'VE WE'VE ALL SEEN IT VERY PUBLICLY HERE RECENTLY -- AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE RESPONSE WHICH IS ONCE AGAIN IT'S THE SAME RESPONSE FROM THE UC YOU RAISE AN ISSUE THEY DO NOTHING. THEY DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BUT THEY KEEP COMING BACK TO US FOR MONEY. KEEP PAN FOR OPERATIONAL COSTS KEEP PAYING FOR MORE THE SAME I I I I QUITE FRANKLY AM TIRED OF IT. AND I'M NOT GOING TO I'M NOT GOING TO ENABLE THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY -- I DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE MONEY THAT WAS SQUIRRELED AWAY IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. READ THAT WE HAD TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOU KNOW. AND I THINK WE TOOK CARE OF THAT PROBLEM HOPEFULLY I MEAN I HOPE WE DON'T FIND SOMETHING ELSE. ISSUE NUMBER SO PLEASE STICK AROUND BUT I THINK YOU I MEAN I I KNOW I AGREE COMPLETION SO WE'RE GONNA GET TO TO BOTH HIS EYES. BUT LOOK I I KNOW YOU YOU INSURE MY FRUSTRATION I KNOW YEAH I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR CONCERNS ON THAT. FACULTY MEMBER IN QUESTION AND THAT'S ONLY ONE OF MY AYE BUT I I WOULDN'T MENTION THAT TOO BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY A ON OUR AGENDA THIS IS THE BUDGET OVERSIGHT TODAY BUT I WITH YOU WE DON'T HAVE THE THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL HERE BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE PEOPLE I'M ON THE DAY EXAM I KNOW PEOPLE SAY ON THEIR OWN TIME. IS THAT PROTECTED SPEECH AND IT WOULD CREATE -- MUCH MORE HEADACHE ILLEGAL A DILEMMA FOR THE UNIVERSITY IF IF WE IF WE MADE A DECISION BUT YOU'RE OVER OUR ARCHING ISSUES I THINK ARE RIGHT IN LINE AND WE'RE LOOKING -- TO HEAVILY SCRUTINIZED -- THAN THE THAN ISSUES COMING UP TO DEGREE COMPLETION BECAUSE RIGHT I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THE MAJORITY ISSUES IN THE CSU. HANDS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOES NOT HAVE ONE PENNY TO ENROLL NEW STUDENTS FROM EAST NICHOLAS. FROM TORRANCE HIGH SCHOOL FROM MCCLATCHY HIGH SCHOOL FROM RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL. AND FOR MUST BE A SANTA BARBARA HIGH SCHOOL. OXNARD HIGH SCHOOL SO THAT IS A DISGRACE AND WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON ON CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE SO WE'LL GET TO THAT SO -- WITH THAT -- MISTER MEDINA OF WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO I DO WANNA RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS -- AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM A THE JOB. UNIT RIGHT CLOSE THE RIGHT SOUTH THERE -- FAR AS FACULTY. ANNA AND I WANT TO DISAGREE I WANT TO DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO -- WHO WHO WHO? WHO WITH MAY HAVE HAD? SOME CONVERSATION. ON THE ISSUE THAT HE RAISES -- UC RIVERSIDEHEADS TO NEW. NOBEL PRIZE -- LAUREATES PROFESSORS COMING TO UC RIVERSIDE I BELIEVE ONE IN PHYSICS AND ONE CHEMISTRY. WHO I GOT TO MEET AT UCLA? RECENTLY AND WHO ARE GONNA HAVE A RECEPTION FOR AT UC ARE AND IN THIS MONTH. SO I I VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO ON THE COMPETENCY. OF THE UC PROFESSORS AND AND AND I AND I REALLY THINK THAT. TO CAST A SHADOW. ON THE PROFESSOR'S. OF USE OF YOU SEE BECAUSE OF ONE PROFESSOR -- ISN'T RIGHT. WE WOULDN'T ALLOW OR WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THAT DONE TO US. AS LEGISLATORS AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO DO IT -- ON UC PROFESSORS EITHER. AND AND AND AS WE SIT AROUND THIS TABLE ALL OF US MANY OF US HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF AND THE BENEFIT OF THE EDUCATION FROM I BELIEVE. OUTSTANDING. UC AND CSU PROFESSORS AND I STILL HOLD THE PROFESSORS OF UC AND CSU IN THAT SAME PLACE THAT I HAD RESPECT FOR THEM. AS AN UNDERGRADUATE WAY BACK IS A STUDENT AT UC ARE AND I DO NOT BELIEVE. AND I DON'T WANT TO ALLOW TO GO BY TO TO SAY THAT THE STATUS OR EVEN A BAD WORD STATUE. OF OF THE PROFESSORS OR THE ABILITY OF THOSE PROFESSORS I DO NOT THINK HAS DECLINED AT ALL. AND SO I I DON'T WANNA LET THAT GO BY -- WITHOUT COMMENT -- AND I WANT TO VERY STRONGLY OF ARGUE FOR THE REQUEST OF YOU SEE FOR THE ON GOING NINETY FIVE MILLION. OF WHICH WHICH UC'S ASKING FOR AS ONGOING MANY I THINK THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS. OF UC AND THE THE THE THE NINETY FIVE MILLION ON GOING TO REPLACE ONE TIME FUNDS. I I I THINK IS A ASCENTIAL AND VERY MUCH WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION IS INCLUDED. IN THE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. MISTER CHAIRMAN SURE WE'LL COME BACK OUT I I ACTUALLY. HADN'T QUITE FINISHED YOU KNOW WHEN AND I AND I AND I DID THE FOR BECAUSE I'VE IKNOW YOU WANTED TO WRAP THAT UP. BUT LOOK AGAIN. MY POINT HERE WAS TO USE AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE. IS A FACULTY ACROSS THE BOARD FACULTY INCREASES IN SALARIES RIGHT -- AND I'M IT YOU KNOW SENT IN THE STATEMENT IS BEING MADE THE L. WE HAVE THIS WORLD CLASS. FACULTY ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO THEREFORE WE MUST. GIVE THIS NINETY FOUR MILLION MORE DOLLARS AND I'M JUST USING THIS AS ONE EXAMPLE -- ONE IS VERY HIGH PROFILE BEEN OUT THERE IN THE NEWS AND JUST AS TWO NOBEL LAUREATES AT RIVERSIDE. DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY ACROSS THE BOARD. IS A NOBEL LAUREATE. RIGHT. ONE PERSON AT UC DAVIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL OF THEM ARE NOT. BUT IT PASSED THE VERY BIG QUESTION. OF DO WE TRULY HAVE. THIS STELLAR FACULTY IN THE UC SYSTEM BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PAINT A BROAD BRUNCH BRUSH LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M BEING ASKED TO DO. BYE BYE BYE APPROVING NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASES. IN SALARIES BECAUSE IT'S IT'S OUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE BEST. WELL I JUST GAVE YOU A VERY HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLE OF WHY I HAD I QUESTION VERY HIGHLY THAT THAT'S THE CASE. AND I DO THINK IT'S A MAJOR ORDEAL. WHEN WE HAVE A PROFESSOR CALLING FOR THE DEATHS OF ANY GROUP PEOPLE GROUP -- I DON'T THINK WE WOULD TOLERATE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES AND IT SHOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES TO COPS. WHO PROTECT US EACH AND EVERY DAY -- AND YEAH I THINK THAT IS BUT THAT WAS ONE OF MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT I HAVE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SALARIES BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT MANY OTHER ISSUES WHICH I THINK MANY OF US WOULD AGREE THERE'S MAJOR PROBLEMS HERE AND SO. WE DON'T NEED TO I THINK WE CAN AGREE. JUST RUBBER STAMP WHAT THIS YOU SEE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING US TO DO WHEN THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS -- SOME AREAS WE MAY AGREE. BUT SOME AREAS WE MAY DISAGREE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. THEN WE ALWAYS HAVE A RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE -- BUT I THINK THERE'S MANY AREAS WHERE WE ARE AT BERRY MUCH IN AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO SEE IMPROVEMENT AND WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO CONTINUE% TO ENABLE. THAT KIND OFATTITUDE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION APPROVED THEIR COSTS THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU. AND I THINK THAT IT'S YEAH I REFLECT TO THE MANY EXAMPLES THAT I HAVE -- OVER THE ELEVEN YEARS THAT I WORKED ON THE CAN'T AT UC SANTA BARBARA CAMPUS -- AND ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW THE ROLE OF A PROFESSOR AND EVERY OTHER EMPLOYEE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED -- NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- THAT WE HAVE AT THE UC -- WE JUST HAD A PANEL THAT TALKED ABOUT -- THE NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO REQUIRE -- A DIFFERENT KIND OF ASSISTANCE -- YOU KNOW. I A THINK OF ALL THE FACULTY THE GRADUATE STUDENTS -- THAT OUR LECTURERS OR THAT ARE YEAH. D. A.'S AND HOW MUCH EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY HAS HAD TO STEP UP TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS -- TO DO DIFFERENT TYPE OF WORK BY -- FOR THE NINE YEARS THAT I WORKED ON THE CAMPUS I WORKED WITH FACULTY WHO WERE NOT PAID TO MENTOR STUDENTS WHO MENTORED STUDENTS -- BY ADVISING THEM WELL ABOVE AND BEYOND TO BECOME SOME DAY PHD STUDENTS -- I A THINK THAT FOR ME. I I REALLY REFLECT ON REALLY THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES -- OVER ELEVEN YEARS OF WATCHING PEOPLE AT THE UC WORKERS AT THE UC GO ABOVE AND BEYOND -- I MEAN WE THINK OF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AS PLACES WHERE STUDENTS GO THEY HAVE STUDENT ACTIVITIES BAY DO EXTRA CURRICULAR SO ALL OF THAT TAKES STAFF. TO BE INVOLVED ALL OF THAT TAKES -- FACULTY TO TRY TO SUPPORT US STUDENTS IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND ALSO IN THE CLASSROOM. I DON'T THINK ANY INSTITUTION ANY INDUSTRY ANY PROFESSIONAL PLACE -- IS ABSENT OF BOTH AMAZING EXAMPLES AND ALSO SOME THAT FALL SHORT SO. AT A THINK FOR ME I SEE THAT. IF WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT. THE METHOD TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IS NOT TO DISINVEST IT'S TO INVEST IN A STRATEGIC WAY -- BECAUSE I THINK DISINVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER ED SYSTEM IN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE CAMPUS IS ALSO A DISINVESTMENT IN THE STUDENTS -- IT IS TRICKLE DOWN I HAVE SAID THIS OVER AND OVER IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS -- THAT WHENEVER ANY CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS THAT YOU KNOW OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IT TRICKLES DOWN TO STUDENTS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THOSE BUDGETS LOOK LIKE. I HAD TO DEAL WITH BUDGET THAT WOULD BE SCALED BACK OR THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK I WAS ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD TO DO THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF REPORTING -- TO EXPLAIN THE SUCCESS OF MY WORK TO SHOW THE NEW METRICS THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS ASKING. FOR IT ALL IT I MEAN IN ALSO MEANT I WAS DOING MORE REPORTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FOLKS WANTED US TO DO WE WE DID IT BUT IT CERTAINLY MEANT I WAS DOING LAST ADVISING I WAS DESK DOING LESS -- PROGRAMMATIC WORK FOR THE STUDENTS THERE ARE REAL TRICKLE DOWN A FAX AND I HOPE -- THAT ARE ARE COMMITTEE CAN THINK ABOUT IF THERE ARE IMPERFECTIONS HOW DO WE ADDRESS THEM AND HAD WE ALSO FOCUS ON REPLICATING THE SUCCESS. EVERY SINGLE SPACE THAT WE DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE POLICY OR BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS FLAWS AND IF ALL WE FOCUS ON ARE THE FLAWS. AND NOT A WAY TO FIX THOSE A THINK THAT WE ARE IN TROUBLE -- WE HAVE A HISTORY OF THIS INVESTING IN HIGHER AT THE MASTERS IT. WE USED TO FIND THE UC. AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL THAN WE DO NOW -- AND I THINK THAT WE ALSO CAN SEE TRENDS OF THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY HELP TO THE STUDENTS ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE OR TAXPAYERS. SO I THINK I WANT TO OFFER THAT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT GETS. VERY LOST IN ONLY TALKING ABOUT OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -- AND NOT SEEN HOW ALL OF OUR DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING TRICKLE DOWN TO EVERY DAY STUDENTS AND THE WORKERS THERE. OKAY WELL THIS WAS OUR FIRST ENGINE ITEM SO WE HAVE A FEW OTHERS -- TO TO TO GET THROUGH THEY TO THE UC I I THINK THE CONCLUSION HERE. IS -- WE ALL LOVE THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA FOR PERSONAL INTEREST OR FOR CONSTITUENTS -- OFF FOR MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- STATE AT THE UC DID YOU MISTER TO MEDINA. YOU DID AS WELL. HI -- I DID NOT -- CERTAINLY MY FATHER DID MY WIFE DIDN'T PROUD OF THAT. YOU SEE -- LEGACY IN OUR FAMILY AND I THINK IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE A GREAT UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS GENERATION THE NEXT. BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID. WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED MONEY AND WE NEED TO BE SMARTER WITH THE SCARCE RESOURCES WE DO THAT FOR HIGHER AT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ARE TRYING TO TO TO FOCUS ON EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET PROCESS NOW -- GOVERNOR. BROWN WAS ABOUT THAT IS FOR THE PARTNERSHIP AND I ASSUME GOVERNOR SOME SO FAR HIS IS THE SAME AND SO THIS IS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE. VERY MINDFUL THAT AS THAT AS WELL -- PRUDENT OVERSIGHT AND I'M NOT AWARE ABOUT THE METRICS THAT WE MADE YOU DO THAT YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF REPORTING. THE MANY THAT GOES TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GO TO A CAMPUS WITHOUT SOME REPORTING THAT'S INVOLVED -- SO WHETHER IT'S TRACKING OF STUDENTS IN TERMS OF MEETING LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM OBJECTIVES WHETHER IT'S THE PROFILE OF THE STUDENT I MEAN I JUST. EIGHTY IT DOESN'T YOU DON'T JUST GIVE MONEY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -- OUT REACH WITHOUT SOMEONE ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN RETURN SO THAT DATA DOES EXIST GOSH I I WASN'T AWARE THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASKING -- WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. ISSUE NUMBER -- TO THIS IS THE STUDENT -- SUCCESS. IT IS YOU THREE I'M SORRY ISSUE THROUGH. YES STUDENT SUCCESS -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY NINE POINT NINE ONGOING AT FORTY EIGHT FORTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR DEGREE ATTAINMENT INSTANCE X.% CERTAIN SERVICES PROGRAMS. THIS WILL ALLOW YOU SEE THE HIGHER NEED TO FACULTY AND OFFER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ENABLE BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES AND IMPROVE TIME TO DEGREE. THE CITY HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO USE THESE FUNDS TO ACHIEVE -- THESE PURPOSES THANK YOU OKAY. THIS COMMITTEE A DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL SOMEWHAT DURING THE HIGHER IT OVERVIEW A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND IT'S PART OF THAT DISCUSSION ASKED THREE QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY THE CORE ISSUES HERE IS REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL I'LL GO THROUGH EACH CORE ISSUE ONE AT A TIME. THE FIRST QUESTION THAT THE COMMITTEE ****. OUT WAS. IS THERE A CONCERN REGARDING STUDENT SUCCESS THAT YOU SEE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA. OF THAT TABLE ON THE ON THE PAGE THEIR DISPLAYS THAT USE THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES FOR ITS GRADUATION RATES FOR ITS FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE. LOOKING BACK FOR YEARS THANKS FOR FRESHMEN IT'S OVER SIXTY SIX OVER 60% -- LOOKING OUT SIX YEARS THAT GRADUATION GOES IT RATE GOES UP TO OVER 80%. I'M LOOKING FOR YOURSELF FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS -- IT'S ALSO -- OVER -- CLOSE 290%. THESE RATES ARE AMONG THE HIGH OR THE OR OR THE HIGHEST AMONG THE STATE'S THREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS ARE THERE ARE HIGHER THAN CSU AND HIGHER THAN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE STATE'S RECOGNIZE THAT HISTORICALLY AND IN PAST YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED FUNDING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. AT THE CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS AND FOCUSED ITS ATTENTION THAT YOU SEE ON OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES THAT THE UNIVERSITY FACES THINGS LIKE ENSURING ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS STUDENTS AND REDUCING OVERALL COSTS ARE YOU SEE. THIS APPROACH IS REASONABLE. THAT'S SAID ONE ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AS IT'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DIFFERENT GAPS IN GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN AT THE TABLE ON PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. NON TELL STUDENTS THOUGH THOSE DIFFERENCES OF LARGELY GO AWAY WHEN SHE LOOKS SIX AND FOUR YEARS OUT FOR FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. BUT IF YOU TURN THE PAGE TO PAGE. NINE YOU WILL SEE DIFFERENCES IN GRADUATION RATES ACROSS THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES NOT JUST TO A LARGE EXTENT REFLECTS THE DIFFERENT ADMISSION. RATES AND SELECTIVITY OF THOSE CAMPUSES. YOU CAN ALSO SEE. DIFFERENT GRADUATION RATES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM GRAPH ON PAGE. NINE AND AS YOU CAN SEE THOSE GAPS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY PERSISTENT OVER TIME. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S ALSO PRESENT AT THE OTHER TWO SEGMENTS IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO YOU SEE BUT THE LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- THIS PERSISTENT GRADUATION AT A GAP BETWEEN THE BY BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. THE SECOND QUESTION THE COMMITTEE ASKED WAS WELL HOW WERE YOU SEE SPEND THESE FUNDS IF IT IF IT WERE APPROPRIATED TO UNIVERSITY. WHEN WE REVIEWS REVIEW THIS PROPOSAL THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL PROVIDED A HIGH LEVEL NARRATIVE HOW WOULD SPEND THE FUNDS BUT WHAT OF MORE DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLANS LACKING? NOW I HAVE TO SAY I LOOK THROUGH THE HANDOUT THAT YOU SEE A RELEASE AND IF YOU GO TO PAGE. TEN I I DO SEE AN EXPENDITURE PLAN I'M LOOKING AT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME SO OUR OFFICE WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY. TO A DRILL DOWN THESE NUMBERS A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTAND THEM AND AND PROVIDE A FULLER ASSESSMENT OF THEM SO I FORTUNATELY I CAN'T COMMENT AT THIS TIME ON THE EXPENDITURE PLAN BUT I I DO SEE IT HERE ON ON THIS PAGE. THE FINAL QUESTION THE LEGISLATURE ASKED WAS WELL. HOW WILL WHAT WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS IN PLACE HOW WE TRACK WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDING MEETS OUR OBJECTIVES? THEN WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT -- ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE MEETING OBJECTIVES. AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT WITH THESE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES BE WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS DEVELOPED -- A LONG TERM TERM PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FUNDS. THAT -- SAID SCHOOLS TO ELIMINATE GRADUATION GAPS THAT EACH CAMPUS AN INCREASE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES -- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS [inaudible] FIFTEEN YEARS. I'M WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE PLACE TO TO START IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE ALREADY REPORTS ON GRADUATION RATES. EACH YEAR BROKEN UP BY STATE CERTAIN STUDENT GROUPS BUT THAT IS THAT -- ANNUAL REPORTING DOESN'T INCLUDE GRADUATION RATES BROKEN OUT BY RACE ETHNICITY. I MEAN DOESN'T -- SO THAT'S AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD -- CHANGE SOME OF ITS EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO TO MATCH WHATEVER BUDGET -- DECISIONS ARE MADE REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU SEE. THANK YOU -- WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZE STUDENT SUCCESS AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN HIS BUDGET INTRODUCTION. OF WE ARE ASKING THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO INCREASE THE STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING FROM FORTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION TO SIXTY MILLION WELL WE'RE GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION. BUT CONTINUE. WE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO INCREASE THAT THAT'S OUR REQUEST -- THE OVERALL GOALS OF OUR STUDENT SUCCESS -- PROGRAM INCLUDE TO ACHIEVING 90% OVERALL SIX YOUR FRESHMAN AND FOR YOUR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATES. TO CLOSE THE GRADUATION GAPS FOR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. AND TO CLOSE THE OVERALL GRADUATE AND DOCTORAL DEGREE ATTAINMENT CAPS FOR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND WOMEN. AS PART OF THESE GOALS CAMPUSES IDENTIFIED A NETWORK OF OVER ARCHING CAMPUS STRATEGY SOME PROGRAMS TO HELP WITH THE UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE ATTAINMENT STRATEGIES. INCLUDING PRE MATRICULATION PROGRAMS TEACHING AND LEARNING CENTERS STUDENT ADVISING HOLISTIC APPROACHES TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND INTEGRATING CORACLE CO CURRICULAR SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. WHAT YOU SEE HER ON SLIDE NINE IS OUR LATEST FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES THIS IS FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO STARTED AS A FRESHMAN IN? TWENTY FOURTEEN ONTHE LEFT YOU SEE A COMPARISON OF THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES BY STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE PELL GRANTS. WHICH IS OFTEN VIEWED AS THE METRIC FOR BEING LOW INCOME. AND THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO NOT FORESEE PELL GRANTS AND THERE IS A GAP OF ELEVEN POINT 7% AND THAT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AND WE WANT TO WORK ON CLOSING DOT. ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE FRESHMEN COHORT TWENTY THIRD AND FALL TWENTY FOURTEEN BROKEN DOWN BY ETHNICITY. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE'S ME THERE REMAIN GAPS AND GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS WITHIN THE UC. AGENTS WANT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT ALL OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE ASSISTANCE TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND GRADUATED IN A TIMELY MANNER. GRADUATING FASTER USUALLY MEANS LESS DEBT THAN THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON THE STUDENT SUCCESS GOAL IS INTENDED TO REMOVE THE INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS THE TIMELY GRADUATION. BEEN ON SLIGHT TENNIS DELAY -- MENTIONED AND I APOLOGIZE OF THE LA -- AND THEY'LL ANALYST AND SEE THIS PRIOR TO THE HEARING -- YOU SEE IT OUR PLAN FOR HOW WE INTEND TO SPEND THESE FUNDS AND DIVIDE THEM BETWEEN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CATEGORIES TO THE CAMPUSES -- AND ON SLIDE ELEVEN MOVING ON YOU'LL AT THOSE LAST LINE OF THE SLIDE CONTAINS OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS POST A HIGHER WITH THESE FUNDS -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH ON SLIDE TEN YOU'LL SEE THAT WAS THE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ITEM -- THESE ADDITIONAL LETTERING FACULTY WOULD HELP US ACHIEVE THESE GOALS PARTICULAR TO FIRST YEAR PROGRAMMING THE CURRICULUM INNOVATION AND INTEGRATING CO CURRICULAR SUPPORT INTO THE CLASSROOM. THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT ON CAMPUS STRATEGIES -- TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STUDENT SERVICES AND ENSURE THAT ACADEMICALLY THE STUDENTS STAY ON TRACK. ON SLIDE TWELVE I SHOWS SOME SAMPLING OF PROGRAMS THAT WE WOULD UNDERTAKE WITH THE SIXTY MILLION -- AND YOU'LL I INCLUDED A PROGRAM FOR MOST OF THE CAMPUS AS YOU CAN SEE WHAT KIND OF THINGS THE CAMPUSES ARE PLANNING ON WORKING ON THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL CAMPUS SPECIFIC. INTENDED TO FILL ALL OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS FOR GUIDING THEIR STUDENTS TO A FASTER GRADUATION. AND THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE ACADEMIC ADVISORS WITH BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN STUDENTS ARE REST AT RISK OF DROPPING OUT. AND NOT MAKING PROGRESS ON THEIR MAJORS PROVIDING THE STUDENTS WITH A NETWORK OF SUPPORT AND THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRESS BY FORMING SMALLER COHORTS WHO TAKE CLASSES TOGETHER AND PROVIDE PEER TO PEER SUPPORT AND HIRING ADDITIONAL ADVISORS. AND THE SPINAL PLANTS ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT NOW. ON PAGE -- THIRTEEN YOU SEE INFORMATION AS TO WHY OF WE THINK. IT'S NECESSARY TO ADDRESS STUDENT. SUCCESS AND FACULTY HIRING. OF THIS DATA COMES FROM OUR UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURVEY WHICH IS CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS. ON THE LEFT YOU SEE A BAR CHART OF STUDENT RESPONSES ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD STILL AND ROLE IN THE UC AFTER THEIR EXPERIENCE ON THE CAMPUS. WE HAVE SEEN A DROP FROM 33% OF STUDENTS STRONGLY AGREEING AND AGREEING A DECADE LATER IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WHAT'S BEHIND THESE NUMBERS WE BELIEVE ARE THE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES THAT STUDENTS HAVE AN OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS THE WAIT TIMES TO SPEAK TO AN ADVISOR. AND BUILDING CONDITIONS AS MAINTENANCE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SCALED BACK. AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE YOU SEE A MORE TROUBLING TRENDS -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HAD 3% OF STUDENTS REPORTING THAT THEY COULD NOT GET INTO THE MAJOR OFF THEIR FIRST CHOICE AND THAT NUMBER HAD GROWN 213% OF STUDENTS BY. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WHAT'S BEHIND THAT IS LACK OF FACULTY TO TEACH COURSES IN THOSE MAJORS -- AND STUDENTS CAN'T CAN'T GET INTO THE COURSES. OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ARE ALSO FEELING LESS CONNECTED TO THEIR FACULTY WITH A PORT 14% DROP OVER TEN YEARS AND STUDENTS WHO FEEL THEY KNOW A FACULTY MEMBER WELL ENOUGH TO ASK FOR A LOT OF WRECKED RECOMMENDATION. THOSE LETTER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO GO INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND AS WE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PHD IS WHO COME FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY BACKGROUNDS AND WHO ARE WOMEN. IT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE TIMES SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE TRENDS AND WANT. TO LEVEL THEM OFTEN -- BEGIN TO REVERSE THEM. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON STUDENT SUCCESS THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU -- IN EIGHTY AS YOU NOTED -- DAILY -- WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS AT OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND IT IN ESSENCE WE THIS IS AN ISSUE AS I SAID EARLIER A BIG ISSUE AT THE CSU SYSTEM AND IN LARGE PART MOST STUDENTS TO GET INTO THE UC. ARE EXTREMELY WELL QUALIFIED. THEY DO WELL. THEY GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IF NOT. THE FORTY SIX UNDERSTAND THAT SIX MAY NOT BE SIX YEARS BUT BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX COULD BE THEY GRADUATED FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. SO -- WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES THAT SOME OF THE CAMPUSES AND YOU SEE HERE AT AT MERCED DIDN'T -- TO SOME EXTENT RIVERSIDE -- WHAT THE AND THE OTHER ISSUES OF COURSE WITH? UNDER REPRESENT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS BUT HOW DO YOU TARGET THAT FOR EXAMPLE AT BERKELEY WITH THIS FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND WE HEARD FROM MR EARLIER. THE BLACK POPULATION SHE'S. IN THE BACKS ONE POINT 6% -- AND SO HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW HAVE YOU GO AND TARGET THAT IF THAT'S WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH. WHEREAS IT'S EASIER AND MASS TO DO IT FOR EXAMPLE AT MAYBE IT CAL STATE LA. WERE YOU YEAR STUDENT POPULATION IS. AB 60% UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY SO I THINK THOSE ARE -- SOME LOGISTICS ISSUES TOO I KNOW WE JUST GOT THE PLAN TODAY I THINK THESE THESE OUTREACH EFFORTS AND HE STARTED EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT -- I THINK IT JUST COMES DOWN FOR US AND ANOTHER REQUEST WAS HIGHER. BUT IF THERE IS NO MORE MONEY COMES ON A REQUEST IT COMES DOWN TO US -- BALANCING THIS PERSISTED ENROLLMENT I MET WITH ONE OF YOUR CHANCELLOR'S AT THE NINE UC CAMPUSES. I ASKED ABOUT THIS HE ASKED HIM OR HER. HOLD SAID KIND OF SLIPPED RIGHT THERE -- ABOUT -- THIS PROPOSAL THEY DID NOT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY SAID THEIR GRADUATIONRATE IS GREAT. IN SEEN ISSUES AND THEY MENTIONED THEY'D RATHER HAVE RESOURCES FOR ENROLLMENT. WHICH I THOUGHT HA. THAT'S OUR PRIORITY. SELL -- I THINK THAT THIS. IF WE HAD UNLIMITED RESOURCES. WOULD BE WOULD BE GREAT BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE -- PRIORITY SO. HE WILL WILL BE EVALUATING THIS BASED UPON -- THE PLAN YOU PRESENTED AND WHAT'S IN THE FINAL MERRY REVISED AS FAR AS REVENUES AND AREN'T OUTSTANDING ISSUES LIKE STUDENT ENROLLMENT FOR THE QUESTIONS MISTER MARTZ WHICH YES I TOTALLY WANT -- TO ECHO -- MISTER SHARE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENROLLMENT YOU KNOW IT AND AND I WANTED TO FOLLOW ON MR GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS EARLIER BUT YOU KNOW WE WE JUST GOT THROUGH THE THE LATEST CYCLE OF A ADMISSIONS -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY ARE CONSTITUENTS THOSE WHO GOT IN THE UC'S THOSE THAT DON'T AND I JUST CONTINUE TO HEAR LIKE YOU KNOW HOW ARE TOP STUDENTS ARE NOT GETTING INTO. IN AND TO OUR UC'S IN MAINE. I GUY I ASKED. I I WAS JUST CONTACTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PALACE EASY. A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND AND YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE BERKELEY IS IN THE U. C. L. A.'S BUT IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW ALSO -- YOU KNOW -- YOU SEE MERCED AND YOU KNOW I SO I ASKED HIM TO DO TO PROVIDE THAT DATA BUT NOW I I KNOW THAT -- OVER THE YEARS I'VE I'VE BEEN HEARING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SAYING THAT. THAT IT'S EASIER TO GET INTO THE ARIZONA UNIVERSITIES INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON OREGON -- IT BIT BUT YOU KNOW AND SO I I JUST WANT. TO CONTINUE TO HAMMER CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS YOU KNOW. AND MAY WE JUST. WE JUST NEED TO GET -- THE WE WE JUST NEED TO KEEP ON HAMMERING FOR FOR MORE ENROLLMENT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA. QUESTION ON THE SLIDE. NINE ON THE GRADUATE FIGURE. TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN THE GRADUATION RATES WHEN ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT THIS GRAPH DOESN'T SHOW IS THE DIFFERENCES ON CAMPUSES AND ON HOW THEY DO -- AND GRADUATION RATES OF FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR RIGHT OR THE DEGREE OF DIFFERENCE. THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES HAVE SUCCESS THEY HAVE RIGHT THIS THESE GRAPHS DON'T SHOW THAT THESE YES THESE GRAPHS -- LEAD GROUP ALL THE UC'S TOGETHER SO THEY DON'T SHOW THE CAMPUS DWELL OR OR OR THAT FIGURE TWENTY SIX WERE CHOSE GRADUATION RATES FOR AND SIX YEAR RATES. IT DOESN'T HAVE AN BROKE BROKEN DOWN -- IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT SHOWING IN THESE GRAPHS WHICH CAMPUSES DO BETTER. OF WITH A GRADUATION RATES HELLO ON A MINORITY STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR. UP SHOWN BY CAMPUS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE FOR SOME FROM SOME CAMPUSES TO OTHER CAMPUSES. ON GRADUATION RATES ON STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THE HOW SOME CAMPUSES DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. IN CLOSING THAT GAP THAT I THINK THAT YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO CLOSE YES THAT'S CORRECT SIR RIGHT WITH THESE THESE GRAPHS DON'T SHOW THAT I THINK THOSE. THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE VERY GOOD TO HAVE FOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO SEE WHAT CAMPUSES. DO A BETTER JOB. ON THE GRADUATION RATES -- AMONG STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WHAT CAMPUSES HAVE CLOSE THAT GAP OF BETWEEN -- A STUDENTS TO COLORS AND AND AND OTHER STUDENTS. ARE I THINK THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE GOOD FOR THIS COMMITTEE YES I WILL I WILL GET THAT TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I AND I SAY THAT ALSO BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT VARIES VERY MUCH FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS OKAY. THANK YOU WELL YES THIS MESSAGE QUESTION -- SO UGH -- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA YOU YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW -- CREATIVELY WORKED INTO THE STUDENT SUCCESS A REQUEST MORE FACULTY HERE AND AND AND AND I PLOW YOUR YOUR CREATIVITY HERE BUT HOW HOW ARE YOU -- PROPOSING TO INCREASE FACULTY AT HOW HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE. INCREASE FACULTY DIVERSITY -- IT GIVEN THAT WE OPERATE UNDER PROPOSITION TWO ONE NINE RESTRICTIONS -- WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM OUR THREE PILOT PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE VERY GENEROUSLY GIVE US TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. TO LOOK AT HOW WE COULD RECRUIT FROM A MORE DIVERSE POOL OF CANDIDATES -- WE LEARNED A LOT -- INCLUDING WHERE TO ADVERTISE -- THE GRADUATE STUDENTS -- TO LET THEM KNOW. IS BEING ADVERTISED -- BUT ALSO TO MAKE THE CAMPUS CLIMATE MORE FRIENDLY WHEN CANDIDATES CAME TO TO CAMPUS THEY MAKE WITH THE DEAN AND SOMETIMES THE FINAL CAN IT'S WITH WITH WITH THE CHANCELLOR. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY WERE VALUED OF WE FOUND THAT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE WE ALSO -- REQUESTED ALL THE CANDIDATES TO INCLUDE A DIVERSITY STATEMENT SO DIVERSITY DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT DIVERSITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES IT TO HIRE GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS INTO THEIR LAB AND WORK WITH -- THEIR COLLEAGUES FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS -- ARE THEY LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR FIELD AND WORK -- IN OUR IN ACROSS -- IT IS IN A WORK WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES IN THEIR RESEARCH AS WELL -- ARE THEY WILLING TO MENTOR STUDENTS FROM. AREAS DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKGROUNDS AND FOSTERED THEM INTO THAT FIELD. SO WE KNOW REQUEST OF THE FACULTY CANDIDATES TO FILL OUT THESE DIVERSITY STATEMENTS -- TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY REALLY -- EMBRACE AN INCLUSIVE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT. SO THAT WOULD THAT WE HAVE FOUND IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU ALL THIS ISSUE OPEN. NEXT ISSUE DEGREE COMPLETION. LATE TWO YEAR YOU SEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS. YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES THE UC WITH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND AND PILOT DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS AND EXPAND CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS THAT EXTENSION CENTERS. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL. IS TO CONNECT WITH THE STUDENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION SO THEY CAN RECEIVE A DEGREE CERTIFICATE OR OTHER CREDENTIAL TO THRIVE ACCESS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ACHIEVE GREATER SUCCESS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU LA A ALWAYS THREE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST ALL THIS PROPOSAL LACKS A LOT OF BASIC INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROPOSAL'S MEETING ITS OBJECTIVES AND ALSO TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY PROPOSE LEVEL OF FUNDING IS JUSTIFIED. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS THAT FOR POSSIBILITIES THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT. THE KEY FOCUS SEEMS TO BE DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS THOUGH THE GOVERNOR ALSO WITH OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS MORE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS. AND ALSO STUDENT OUTREACH AND EACH OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES N MIND. AND AGAIN WITHOUT A MORE DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLAN IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIFTEEN MILLION IS IS ALIGNED WITH THE COST OF WHAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE. AND I I CHECKED THROUGH THE POWER POINT AT YOU SEE I DON'T SEE ANY -- UNDER YOUR PLAN SO I DID SEE. THANK YOU -- SO ON THE SO THE SECOND CONCERN WE HAVE IS EVEN EVEN WHERE THE LEDGE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS WOULD GET SPENT -- THAT ALIGNS IT WITH ITS OBJECTIVES. WE DON'T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S MADE A CASE YET THAT'S STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH ITS OBJECTIVE -- YOU SEE EXTENSION CENTERS ARE SELF SUPPORTING ENTERPRISES AND AND PART OF THEIR MISSION. IS [inaudible] TO OF OF MAINTAIN RESERVES THAT IT THAT THE USE TO FIND THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- HAVE A POTENTIAL OF A MARKETABILITY AND AND CAN ATTRACT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO COVER COSTS. THIRD AS STAFF IN YOUR GENDER NOTED -- CSU ALREADY HAS ABOUT YOUR DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS% AND THIS RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WELL THE UC A PROGRAM BE SOMEWHAT DUPLICATIVE WITH THE CSU PROGRAM WOULD -- COVER AN ADDITIONAL NEED THAT CSU WASN'T COVERING. AND WHAT WITH THE ADVANTAGE BE OF SAY EXPANDING THE EXISTING CSU PROGRAMS VERSES YOU SEE VERSUS CREATING NEW PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE. GIVEN THESE QUESTIONS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR. AND ALLOW THE MINISTRATIONS COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH A MORE DEVELOPED PLAN. OKAY THANK YOU YOU SEE. THANK YOU -- WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OF ROLAND DEGREE COMPLETION FOR STUDENTS WHO LEFT WITHOUT DEGREES. WE REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME TO ADDRESS THE UC DEGREE COMPLETION EFFORTS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE OVER. SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE LEFT THE UC WITHOUT A DEGREE. ONLY ABOUT A FOURTH OF THE STUDENTS GO TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION TO COMPLETE A DEGREE THAT MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS OUT THERE WHO NEVER COMPLETED A DEGREE. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR TO HELP THESE FORMER STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES AND BEGIN EARNING HIGHER SALARIES. ON SLIDE -- FIFTEEN I DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO ARE THE STUDENTS WHO LEAVE WITHOUT DEGREES -- AND IS PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY YOU SEE THAT ARE ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM. LEAVE WITH HAVING COMPLETED ONE HUNDRED UNITS OR MORE. OF THE STUDENTS REPRESENTS A VERY LOW HANGING FRUIT TO BRING BACK TO A FOR DEGREE COMPLETION BECAUSE MOST AGREES ARE ABOUT HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITS. SO WE COULD BRING THEM BACK AND THEY COULD COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES RELATIVELY QUICKLY -- THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR OUTREACH TO FORMER UC STUDENTS HAVE NOT WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED A DEGREE -- FOR HIGH TOUCH STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT AND ADVISING TO ENSURE COMPLETION FINANCIAL AID TO NEEDY STUDENTS TO PAY FOR YOU SEE EXTENSION COURSES. AND OTHER PROGRAMS SUPPORT AT THE CAMPUS AS A MORE DETAILED OF PLAN IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE LATER. THANK YOU. I WAS THE IS THINKING ABOUT THIS -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE NEED MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH COLLEGE DEGREES [inaudible] AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKFORCE MAY HAVE A GREAT JOB AND LEFT CALLS. FOR A REASON THAT THEY NEED TO GRAY THEY ALREADY HAD A JOB YOUR AT SPEAKER THIS ASSEMBLY. JOHN A PET S. MONEY REGIONS NEVER GOT HIS DEGREE. HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT A GOOD JOB LABOR ORGANIZER HE BECAME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND BECOME A SPEAKER AND I WAS I THINK KINDA. THE BOSS OF YOUR BUS. AND HE DIDN'T SEE A NEED TO GO BACK. TO GET HIS DEGREE. SO HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT ARE OUT THERE WHO. HAVE THEIR I GUESS THIS BEGS THE QUESTION IS IS IT IS IT A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR PROBLEMER HOW HE'S INDIVIDUALS. IF THEY GOT THEIR DEGREE ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BE. HUGE BENEFIT TO OUR ECONOMY THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE NEED TO GET YOUNGER PEOPLE INTO. THE PIPELINE TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE SO HOW MUCH. ANALYSIS DO WE HAVE ON ON ON ON THAT HYPOTHETICAL THEY GAVE YOU I I DO NOT HAVE -- AN ANALYSIS OF HOME WHAT THE INCOME LEVEL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS WHO HAVE LEFT IN INCOME LEVEL BUT ARE THEY GAINFULLY EMPLOYED ARE THEY IS NOT HAVING A DEGREE. LIMITING THEIR CAREER OPTIONS. FOR FOR MOST INDIVIDUALS IT WOULD LIMIT THEIR CAREER OPTIONS NOT EVERYBODY IS A JOHN PARIAHS OR A STEVE JOBS -- MOST INDIVIDUALS DO NEED -- HIGHER EDUCATION IN ORDER TO HAVE IN A CAREER TRACK. THAT WOULD -- PAY THEM BETTER THAN NOT HAVING A HIGHER DEGREE OF SOME KIND. SO -- BUT I DON'T HAVE THE ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS -- ARE WHAT LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OKAY. AND LIKE THIS REQUEST IS FOR FOR ONE TIME. ONE TIME MENTOR AVENUE AND THEN BY GOING. BY GOING BACK TO THE EXTENSION YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GET YOUR DEGREE PER SE RIGHT. YOU CAN TAKE THE COURSES THROUGH THE EXTENSION THAN THE THAN THOSE COURSES WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE CAMPUS STUFF WOULD BANG PRINTED A GREAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HANDING OFF PROCESS THAT WOULD OCCUR. OKAY. OKAY. STRATEGY I AND I WOULD AGREE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM I I KNOW SO MANY KIDS THAT WOULD. DIE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THEM FIRST CALIFORNIA KIDS. THANK YOU OR PROVIDE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO HELP THE STUDENTS GET THEIR DEGREE. OKAY HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. MISTER CHAIR. FOR THIS NEXT ITEM CAN I INVITE MY COLLEAGUES GROUP IN KANETO CO DIRECTOR OF THE BASIC NEEDS INITIAL AT THE TABLE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GROWING GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS STUDENT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS -- ALTHOUGH UC'S PROPOSAL CALL FOR FINANCIAL AID THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS BROADER -- THE BUDGET ALLOWS THE USE OF THESE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOOD PANTRIES -- CAL FRESH ENROLLMENT SUPPORT MEAL SHARING PROGRAMS AND OTHER SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED THROUGH THE ON HUNGER FREE CAMPUS INITIATIVE -- AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO A HOUSE HOMELESS STUDENTS AND HOUSING SECURE STUDENTS. WITH FINANCIAL AID AS AS A POSSIBILITY BUT NOT THE THE ONLY PIECE OF THIS OF THIS MUCH LARGER PLAN THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE HAVE THREE ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN OUT SOMEWHAT -- TO DECIDE WHETHER FUNDING FIND MORE FINANCIAL AID FOR FOOD AND HOUSING INITIATIVES -- WOULD THAT SOLVE THE ISSUE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE REGENTS HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH. OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT. UNDERSTOOD THE UNDERLYING CAUSES -- BEHIND WHY STUDENTS. DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES -- TO PURCHASING OF FOOD OR FACING FOOD AND SECURITY -- ARE NOT ENTIRELY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE UNIVERSITY HAS A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT. CONSIDERS THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND MAKING FINANCIALLY DECISIONS AND SO THERE'S SOME QUESTION HERE ABOUT WHAT ISN'T WORKING IN TERMS OF THAT FINANCIALLY PROGRAM. ARE WE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT -- HOW MUCH STUDENTS WORK AND BORROW AND HOW MUCH FAMILIES CONTRIBUTE TO COSTS? ARE WE MISS MEASURING WHAT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS A REASONS QUESTIONS LIKE THAT. AND PRESUMABLY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES BEHIND -- FOOD AND SECURITY WOULD DETERMINE WHICH APPROACH WOULD BE MOST TARGETED AND MOST EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT STUDENTS JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO TO COVER FOOD COSTS. LIKELY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS MORE MONEY. TYPICALLY WE DO THAT THROUGH FINANCIAL AID -- SOMETIMES WE ALSO DO THAT THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN THE CASE OF A COLLEGE STUDENT. ALTERNATIVELY A STUDENTS FACED A FINANCIAL EMERGENCY IN THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR SAY OFF A FAMILY MEMBER LOSES A JOB OR THERE'S SOME SORT OF A HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT COMES UP THAT INCREASES THEIR COSTS. WILL FINANCIALLY PROGRAM MIGHT NOT BE RESPONSIVE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHERE SOMETHING MAYBE LIKE A FOOD BANK FOR EXAMPLE COULD. ADDRESS OUR MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS WHAT A FURTHER UNDERSTANDING. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER INCREASING FINANCIAL AID INCREASING -- ON CAMPUS FOOD INITIATIVES WHICH OF THOSE WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. THE SECOND ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE STILL UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS WAYS THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INTERACT WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS -- IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY AS A LARGE NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE WHO COULD QUALIFY FOR FOOD BENEFITS. YOU SEE REPORTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT AND WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ROLLED OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ON THE CAL FRESH THAT SUGGESTS THERE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A LARGE POOL OF STUDENTS THAT WE WERE THAT -- QUALIFIED FOR CALIFORNIA MEAN ON AVERAGE BEEN RECEIVING THEM FOR WE DON'T HAVE GOOD COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON HOW MANY STUDENTS MIGHT QUALIFY FOR CAL FRESH BENEFITS. THE THIRD ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. IS ONE OF A KIND OF AN EQUITY ISSUE BETWEEN THE THREE SEGMENTS AND I THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED THE SOMEONE IN THE PAST -- CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES THE MOST AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR LIVING COSTS TO YOU SEE STUDENTS PROVIDES LESS FUNDING FOR LIVING COSTS TO STUDENTS AT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A ONGOING FUNDING AT YOU SEE ONLY SO THAT TO SOME EXTENT THIS PROPOSAL FURTHER EXACERBATES THAT IN EQUITY. GIVEN THESE ISSUES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON OF THE LEGISLATURE TO FURTHER STUDY THESE ISSUES FURTHER STUDY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES FURTHER STUDY HOW PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WORK AND GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. NOW OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS TO DECIDE HOW TO APPROPRIATE FUNDING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND FURTHER STUDYING THE ISSUE KIND OF DELAYS OF THE SOME ANSWERS THERE THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO IN THE INTERIM ONE APPROACH LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE IS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A ONE TIME FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THESE PROGRAMS -- FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE PROVIDED A ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TWO FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR HOW MUCH FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN PREVIOUS YEARS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SEE YOU -- WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENT BASIC NEEDS ISSUES IN PRIOR YEARS SOME PROVIDED YOU SEE WITH ONE TIME FUNDS TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. AND YOU'LL SEE ON SLIDE SIXTEEN LISTED SOME OF THE FUNDS YOU PROVIDED TO US IN THE PAST WE'RE ALSO VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. GOES BEYOND THE CLASSROOM AND STUDENTS DESERVE SAFE PLACES TO LIVE AND FREEDOM FROM HUNGER. WE'RE ASKS THAT YOU APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING FOR YOU SEE TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT BASIC NEEDS ISSUES. OF RUBEN WILL NOW DISCUSS SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALREADY TAKEN AND BOTH WERE PROPOSING TO DO WITH THESE FUNDS THANK YOU FOR OPEN ASSAM. OUR GUYS SAY THANK YOU ALL IT'S MADE DAYS MENTAL HEALTH DAY IT'S NATIONAL NICE AND NATIONAL COLLEGE SIGNING DAY I JUST CAME FROM THE BIG GIVEN THAT WE HOSTED AT BERKELEY I WAS THE MC THERE AND THEN I JUST BOOKED IT OVER HERE. AND WE'RE STILL HERE WITH YOU ALSO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK BUT IT WAS UCLA THEY GOT MACHEL ABIDES YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT INTERNAL CONVERSATION WE GOT GOING ON THEY GOT MICHELLE OBAMA THEY GOT JOHN LEGEND THEY GOT LIKE NBA STARS IN A FELLOW STARS. AND THEN OUR POOR BERKELEY YOU'VE GOT ME AS THE M. C. SO. THAT'S NEVER REALLY AND NOT AT ALL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IN AN EQUITABLE EXPERIENCE THAT'S DIFFERENT SO THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT THERE -- BUT IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL TO BE THERE WITH THEM -- STUDENTS THAT WERE GOT THAT ARE GOING TO TECHNICAL SCHOOL COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU YOU SEE ALL IN ONE SPACE AND ALL BEING CELEBRATED BECAUSE THEY'RE FURTHERING THEIR EDUCATION INTO COLLEGE AND IT WAS REALLY POWERFUL TO BE THERE WITH THEM. SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR STILL BEING HERE WITH US SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ALL I'M OFFERINGS. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE WITH YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS AND LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL ASK THAT YOU WANTED US TO DELIVER TODAY. AND IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AS YOU PREPARE TO APPROVE THE BUDGETS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BRING THOSE TO YOU ALL. SO YOU ASK FOR YOU SEE TO IMPROVE ITS DATA ON STUDENT FOOD SECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS. AS OF TODAY THE UC HAVE THE LARGEST DATA SAID ON COLLEGE STUDENT FOOD SECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS ARE UC SYSTEM MY UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURREY NOW INCLUDES OUR BASIC NEEDS INSTRUMENT AND IT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. ARE YOU SEE COST OF ATTENDANCE STUDY HAS AN UPDATED INSTRUMENT TO BETTER CAPTURE THE COST OF BASIC NEEDS TO INFORM SYSTEM MIGHT IN CAMPUS SPECIFIC STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING ALSO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. OUR STUDIES AND RECENT PUBLICATION SHOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE MENTAL HEALTH AND TIME TO DEGREE ONE OF THIS YEAR'S MAJOR MILESTONES FOR YOU SEE BASIC NEEDS RESEARCH AND EVALUATION EFFORTS WAS A CONFIRMATION OF DOCTORS TO SIGN A MARTINEZ AS APPOINTMENT. AT UC SAN FRANCISCO AND HER ACCEPTANCE AS THE UC SYSTEM MY BASIC NEEDS RESEARCH AND EVALUATION LEAD. SHE'S OFF TO A STRONG START WITH TWO MAJOR PROJECTS LEADING THE CREATION OF A VALIDATED INSTRUMENT TO IDENTIFY HOUSING AND SECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS RATES. AND THE SECOND LEADING THE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IRB APPROVED EVALUATION INSTRUMENT FOR A BASIC NEEDS INTERVENTIONS. THIS WAS THE A COMP THIS WAS ALL ACCOMPLISHED THANKS TO THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED THAT YOU ARE PUSH FOR IT LAST YEAR -- THE SECOND IS LAST YEAR YOU ARE REQUESTED THAT WE GENERATE AND ON DUPLICATED COUNT OF STUDENTS THAT EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY AND OR HOMELESSNESS SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU SEE A PIECE AS ADDITIONAL RESEARCH. AND ACADEMIC PLANNING TEAM WERE HAPPY TO CONFIRM THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED THIS REQUEST THE DATA SAID FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEENS UC FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITY STUDY WHICH IS AGAIN THE STUDY REFERENCE AS THE LARGEST TO DATE. WE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE ON DUPLICATED STUDENTS WHEN I KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES AND THE PERCENTAGE. OF TOTAL CAMPUS POPULATION I KNOW THAT MAY -- SOME MEMBER MEDINA YOU ASKED EARLIER WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF WHO'S HAVING A BETTER EXPERIENCE SUPPORTING STUDENTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I OFFERED THAT DATA FOR YOU IN TERMS OF BASIC NEEDS. NOW WE KNOW THAT 35% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION I YOU SEE BERKELEY IS EXPERIENCING A BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGE 40% OF UC DAVIS OF MERCED. 45% OF RIVERSIDE -- FRANCISCO 44% OF SANTA BARBARA AND 43% OF SANTA CRUZ SO WHEN YOU ARE ASKED US HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING ON EACH ONE OF THOSE CAMPUSES THOSE ARE THE RATES AND IT'S EXCITED. TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU ALL. NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN ABOUT ARE WE JUST GIVING STUDENTS -- FOOD ARE WE JUST GIVING THE MONEY TO PAY FOR RENT AND ACTUALLY A LOT MORE ROBUST OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE SAME FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN. FROM STATE LEADERSHIP FROM FACULTY FROM DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND FROM THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES THAT ASKED THIS IS HOW WE WANT TO BE SERVE AND WE TRY TO CREATE A MODEL ON THAT. SO WE ESTABLISH THAT TEN CAMPUSES HAVE ACTING BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEES THAT INCLUDE UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE STUDENTS STAFF FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND COMMUNITY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND OR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS AT THE TABLE. THE CULTURES OF THESE COMMITTEES FORMED THE SYSTEM WIDE BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEE THAT IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH SYSTEM MIGHT CONVERSATIONS SEGMENTS SOME OF YOU ALL SAW -- COLLEEN AND DENISE EARLIER TODAY WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND SEE IS YOU TO STRATEGIZE HOW DO WE DO COUNTY STRATEGIES AND STATE STRATEGIES TOGETHER. AN ARMADA INCLUDES RESEARCH AND EVALUATION CAMPUS PREVENTION STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGIES AND ADVOCACY STRATEGIES THIS MODEL ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THE MICRO WHICH IS THE STUDENT NEED TO THE MACRO WHICH IS THE POLICIES AND SYSTEMS AREAS. TO MOVE US TOWARD STUDENT ECONOMIC FOOD AND HOUSING JUSTICE. THE THIRD AREA THAT YOU WANTED US TO DISCUSS WAS A RESPONSE TO THE ON GOING FUNDING. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF OPERATION LIES IN ARE YOU SEE BASIC NEEDS MODEL CAMPUSES IN OUR SYSTEM MIGHT COMMITTEES ARE READY FOR ON GOING FINDING. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FUNDING FOR OUR YOU SEE BASIC NEEDS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ONE YEAR ALLOCATIONS ONE YEAR ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL TO LEARN BILL DOT INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT ALLOWED US TO IMPLEMENT MADE AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO MOVE TOWARDS LOWER AND BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES FROM THE FIRST DAY THAT THE STUDENT STARTS IN THE UNIVERSITY TO THE POINT OF GRADUATION. WE ARE AS YOU ALL HAVE SEEN YOU SEEN THE REPORT HOMELESSNESS ACTUALLY INCREASES AS YOU STAY IN THE UNIVERSITY FIRST YEAR HOMELESSNESS RATES IS ABOUT 3%. AND LAST YEAR RATES ARE ABOUT STRATEGIES TO FLIP THAT ALL THE ART SO THAT IT STARTS AT A HIGHER RATE THAT WE DON'T GET WE DON'T CONTROL STUDENTS COME IN ALREADY EXPERIENCING HOUSES THAT'S HOMELESSNESS. AND WE WANT INTERVENE THAT ON THE WAY DOWN. SO WITH THAT SAID ON A PROPOSAL DEVELOPED BY OUR COMMITTEE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AT EACH CAMPUS WOULD RECEIVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. FOR A TOTAL OF HALF OF THE FUNDING WHICH IS SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION AS A BASELINE ALLOCATION. THE REMAINING SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THROUGH AN ALLOCATION OF EQUITY BASED ON ITS ON DUPLICATED POPULATION THAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT. THIS METHOD IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU SEE HAS USE PASS ALLOCATIONS AND IT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THE GREATEST NEEDS ON SOME CAMPUSES THE GREATEST NEED IS HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO. AND BERKLEY -- ON OTHERS THE GREATEST THING MAY BE AMONG THE SUBSET OF POPULATION LIKE STUDENT PARENTS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WITHOUT ANY JOB WITHOUT ANY CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT OR OFF CAMPUS CLIMATE. THE MODEL WILL ALLOW THE CAMPUS IS TO TARGET RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY WE ARE ENCOURAGING OUR CAMPUSES TO UTILIZE OUR EQUITABLE FUNDING TO ADDRESS EQUITY GAPS GENERATED BY FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES. AN EXAMPLE OF AN EQUITY GAP INTERVENTION IS TO CREATE A GROCERY SUPPORT AWARD THAT WOULD MATCH SNAP CAL FOR ASH FINDS FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE INELIGIBLE FOR THEM. WHEREAS SNAPPING CAFES PROVIDES UP TO ONE NINETY TWO PER MONTH WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENTS WE WILL CREATE A COMPARABLE AWARD FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE SUPPORT. KEEP POPULATIONS TO NAME HERE ON DOCUMENTS STUDENTS GRADUATE STUDENTS STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENTS AND STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CUT OFF BY THEIR FAMILIES WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE SOME OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM WEALTHY BACKGROUNDS BUT THEY GET CUT OFF BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITIES A ROMANTIC PARTNER SOMETHING ELSE. GOING ON IN THE FAMILY AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND THERE'S NOTHING TO SUPPORT THEM. TO THE SUCCESS THAT YOU SEE HAS A G. WITH THE PASS ONE TIME APPROPRIATINS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE IS EQUAL AND EQUITABLE APPROACH WILL WORK AND LASTLY. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS ARE YOU SEE BASIC NEEDS EFFORTS HAVE THRIVED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BOTH. OF CAL YES PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IS THIS GONNA GENERATED IN EQUITY ACROSS THE SEGMENTS WHERE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE SEGMENTS. FROM DAY ONE IN THIS CONVERSATION. WE'RE WORKING ALSO WITH THE FOUNDATION OFCALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECTS TO GUESS AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AS WELL AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT COME INTO PLAY AND SERVING THE STUDENTS WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR VILLAGE APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOU SEE EFFORTS BENEFIT AND IMPROVE. THE BASIC NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS WHERE ONE HIGHER EDUCATION VILLAGE AND THE BETTER THAT WE CARE FOR STUDENTS TODAY THE BETTER THAT WILL BE AND TAKING CARE OF THE STATE TOMORROW. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THANK YOU. UGH THANK YOU GUYS CHAIR I STILL WANTED TO ADD THAT WE'RE NOT JUST ASKING FOR IMMEDIATE HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUNDS THE UNIVERSITY DOES HAVE A LONG TERM PLAN TO CONSTRUCT MORE HOUSING FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WANT TO ADD ANOTHER FIFTEEN THOUSAND DORMITORY BEDS TO OUR CAMPUSES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS. TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY. NOWADAYS -- DID THE EMERGENCY ISSUES EMERGENCY RE HOUSING AND TO GET PEOPLE A BRIDGE TO GET. SOMEWHERE ELSE I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED BY MEETING WITH -- THE CHANCELLOR. THEY'RE ALL APPEAR RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS CHANCELLOR BECAUSE OF COURSE CLOSELY. AND HE WAS SAYING THAT A FEW YEARS I'LL HAVE ENOUGH SPACE. THE END OF BEDS ON THE CAMPUS TO HOUSE. 80% OTHER STUDENTS FOR ALL FOUR YEARS MAKE THAT. WHICH IS AMAZING AND UC SAN DIEGO. AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SPACE ISSUES AT BERKELEY -- LOS ANGELES -- SANTA CRUZ SANTA BARBARA SO WE HAVE -- LIMITATIONS THERE THINK OF A LOT OF ROOM AT RIVERSIDE MY UNDERSTANDING FOR I'VE BEEN BEFORE HOUSING. WE HAVE LAND THERE -- YOU KNOW THIS IS FOR YOU AND FOR SAY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. THAT WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT MIND BOGGLING TO KNOW THAT SOME OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT. WE WENT TO A OF THAT TOWN HALL FEW DAYS AGO COUPLE SANDERS MYSELF HERE AT SAC STATE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND THEY HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL FOOD PANTRY THAT CAN HAVE THIRTY SIX AT A TIME AND THEY'RE PICKING UP FOOD AND JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE IS ROOM FOR FIVE STUDENTS. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS FACILITY -- JUST MAKES YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH SO. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM -- WANT TO ADDRESS AND WE HAVE HAD ONE TIME MY LAST FEW YEARS AND SO. CERTAINLY AT I'M I'M I'M PLEASE THEY WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING ONGOING -- MONEY HERE -- INTO THESE BASIC NEEDS ALSO TIES WITH THE ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR STUDENTS AS AS YOU LIVE TO ONE ISSUE THAT I THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW COULD REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR SO MANY OF US. AND AND FOR ONCE AND I CAN. NOT PUSH TO GET THE YOU SEE HERE BUT IT'S IS A HIGHER ISSUE AS A WHOLE -- IS. SOME YOUR STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME BY DEFINITION THEIR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AND THEIR INCOME IS EXTREMELY LOW. AND IT'S SUCH A HOP. SO DIFFICULT SO HARD TO ENROLL AND CAL FOR ASH YEP ALL THE PAPERWORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND THIS AND THAT SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP TO TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND WE WELCOME ANY SUGGESTIONS OR IDEAS. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE EXACT STUDENTS THAT WHO WANT TO GET HELP AND ONE THEY'RE HUNGRY. I'M TO WE'RE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH OUR CAL FRESH PROGRAM SO. WE REALLY OUGHT TO BE -- STEPPING IT UP TO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR STUDENTS TO TO PARTICIPATE NOW WE HAVE A YOU HAVE A YES THEY HAVE THAT MAGIC SOLUTION FOR US TONIGHT SO SOMETHING'S NOT A SUMMONS SHARE WITH YOUR EYES THAT SO ACTUALLY -- SENATOR -- PATTY MURRAY WAS ABLE TO MOVE -- A BILL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT HAS UPDATED THE NATIONAL. FINANCIAL AID DATA SHARING TREE AND WHAT THAT DOES NOW IS IT ALLOWS US TO USE FINANCIAL AID DATA. AND WE CAN TAP INTO THAT DATA FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANT. REASONS WHEREAS BEFORE WE COULD NOT USE FINANCIAL AID DATA SO WE WANTED TO ASK FINANCIAL AID OFFICES HEY GIVE ME THE LIST OR THE ROSTER. OF PELL GRANTS STUDENTS AND WORK STUDY STUDENTS AND STUDENTS RECEIVING A CAL GRANT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH NASA FAR WE'RE GONNA GO. TO THE NASA NATIONAL CONFERENCE WE'RE GONNA BE STRATEGIZING AND AS SOON AS NEXT THIS UPCOMING ACADEMIC YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CREATE COHORT MODELS OF INTERVENTION SO THESE THIS FUNDING THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW. THEN GETS OPERATIONALIZE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE STAFFING STUDENTS STAFFING THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO SAY EVERY STUDENT IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SUBSET OF THOSE ROSTERS. SO THEN YOU HAVE BLACK STUDENTS SERVING BLACK STUDENTS LGBT PLUS STUDENTS SERVING LGBT PLUS STUDENTS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND REACHING OUT TO THEM TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT NOT JUST CAO FRESH. BUT ALSO ABOUT THE HOLISTIC SUPPORT SERVICES ON BASIC NEEDS ON THOSE CAMPUSES WHICH WE NEVER BEEN NEVER TO DO BEFORE SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THOSE EFFORTS BUT I DO WANT TO POINT THAT. IN THE REPORT THAT WE SUBMITTED TO YOU ALL BACK IN FEB. AND YOU SEE THE CAL FRESH NUMBERS YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT A CAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE SANTA BARBARA -- TWENTY SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS BERKELEY THIRTEEN HUNDRED DAVIS THIRTEEN HUNDRED THE CAMPUS IS THAT HAVE COUNTY RELATIONSHIPS ARE STARTING TO SEE THEIR NUMBERS GO UP SO THE POWER HERE IN THE NEW WORK WORK THAT WE DEVELOP FOR SOCIAL SERVICES IS. HOW TO WE ENHANCE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND FOR THE CAMPUS IS FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT HAVE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS HOW DO WE MAKE THAT CENTER FOR THE COMMUNITY? SO THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING CAL FRESH EFFORTS THE STAFF AND THE STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO SERVE EVERYBODY SO FOR EXAMPLE AT UC BERKELEY WE KNOW THAT BERKELEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS DOWN THE STREET FROM UC BERKELEY. HOW DO WE GET BERKELEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO COME ONTO CAMPUS AND ALSO GET SUPPORT WITH THEIR CAL FIRST APPLICATIONS SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT? HOW DO WE DO CROSS SEGMENT STRATEGIES IN SUPPORT OF THE STUDENTS AT LARGE? OKAY MISTER RIGHT CITY THANK YOU SO I I AM -- NOT -- UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING WHY. I MEAN YUBA MUST CHAIR YOU MENTION A LOT OF PAPERWORK BUT WHY WHY IF IF THE STUDENTS CAN GET FOOD. WHY WHY ARE THEY APPLYING FOR CALPERS? YEAH SO A COUPLE THINGS SO ONE IS -- DAIS THE THE CHALLENGE THAT COMES UP FOR STUDENTS IS THAT. SOME STUDENTS APPLY ON THEIR OWN AND THEY HAVE REALLY CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES ON THEIR OWN SO THEN THEY TELL OTHER STUDENTS THAT IS NOT WORTH IT TO APPLY. BECAUSE THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY NOW THAT FACILITIES THAT PROCESS AND SENSE OF THE NEW FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM YACHT NOW THEIR STAFFING ON CAMPUS. TO GUIDE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY THROUGH IT SO NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THE NUMBERS INCREASE THERE'S ALSO THE HUGE CONVERSATION OF STUDENTS KNOWING THAT THEY NEED TO COME IN TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. A LOT OF STUDENTS UNFORTUNATELY THE COUNTY STILL LEARNING HOW TO WORK WITH STUDENTS. SO IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET CAO FRESH YOU DON'T JUST APPLY YOU ALSO HAVE TO COMPLETE AN INTERVIEW. AND THAT PHONE INTERVIEW SOMETIMES THEY GET PHONE CALLS FROM THE COUNTY AND THEY'RE IN CLASS OR THERE AND WORK AND THEY MISS THAT PHONE CALL AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO MAKE UP THAT PHONE CALL. SO THEY HEAR ABOUT THOSE HORROR STORIES VERY SIMILAR TO STUDENT LOANS WHEN MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE THEY HEAR ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A LOAN DEBT. AND THAT KEEPS THEM FROM ACCEPTING THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS LOAN THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IT'S GOING TO ESCALATE TO THAT LEVEL THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THAT WERE CLEANING UP. THE GOOD THING NOW IS THAT OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICES ARE STARTING TO SEND OUT TEXT MESSAGES TO STUDENTS AND SAYING HEY YOU ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR CALIBRATION THERE'S A TEAM ON CAMPUS THAT CAN HELP YOU. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE SEEING THEIR NUMBER STARTING TO GO UP. I MADE IT IT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT WE IN A HOME WE WOULD WOULD WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED -- TO I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS THAT AT SOME POINT HEALTHY WE CAN'T LIKE HAND HOLD THEM THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU KNOW I MEAN IF THEY'RE HUNGRY. AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS THAN THEY SHOULD. YOU KNOW DO WHAT IT TAKES TO APPLYING I THINK THERE'S MORE THAT THERE'S THESE WORK REQUIREMENTS. TWENTY HOUR. WORK REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE COUNTY OFFICIALS THAT THEIR STUDENT AND IN OUR TRAINING. HAVE STUDENTS GO MORE FULL TIME -- AND I I I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS LOOK WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE FREE LUNCH IF YOU'RE FREE LUNCH YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY ALSO FOR OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT SO. WE IT SEEMS THAT WE SHOULD SIMPLIFY THINGS I DON'T THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ARE LAZY AND ON DO IT. THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING IN IN THERE TO GET -- FOOD IN HERE AT THAT WILL TO WANT SEX. EIGHT TWO DAYS AGO AND AND TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE THE OLD BIBLICAL REFERENCE GIVE SOMEBODY A FISH FOR A DAY OR TWO TO THE FISH FOR LIFE GRANTED FOOD STAMPS IS NOT FISH FOR LIFE BUT WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE STARVING STUDENT. AND THEY THEY SAY IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT A LOT OF THESE ARE THESE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SO. THESE IS NOT OUR PURVIEW TO CHANGE THAT BUT I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT SO IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN OUR POWER TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS SAID. TO DO THIS PLEASE LIST NOW -- SO WITH THAT THIS IS AGAIN A PRIORITY OF OURS WILL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS THE BASIC NEEDS WITH UC I'M SORRY CSU AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND COME OUT WITH THAT. MAYBE A REFINED PROPOSAL IN AND IN MAY. ALL THIS ISSUE OPEN THE NEXT ISSUE CAPITAL OUTLAY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CHAIR. RAINY CATS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YOU SEEM A USE OF SUPPORT APPROPRIATION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS ADDRESSING THE NEED TO FACILITIES THAT SERVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. AT IN ADDITION THIS AUTHORITY ALLOWS YOU SEE TO FINANCE THE COST OF THE FIRST MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE HOWEVER SUPPORT APPROPRIATION NOTED THAT SERVICE CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY YOU SEE SUBMIT ONE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SIX CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST. ALL ARE QUALIFYING PROJECTS AND ONCE FUNDED WILL RAISE THE PROJECT IN MASS AND PERCENTAGE TO SIX POINT 8% WELL BELOW THE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- SO WE DO NOTE THEN THE COMMENTS THAT THERE'S SOME PROPOSED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. ADMINISTRATION IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING -- UC'S PROPOSED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING ASSOCIATED PROJECTS TO ENSURE THE FUNDING DOES THE US USES THAT OUTCOMES. HOWEVER WE KNOW CONCERNS WITH THE BREADTH OF THE ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU. SO THERE ARE TWO ISSUES BEFORE YOU IN THIS ITEM THE FIRST IS CAPITAL OUTLAY IN THE SECOND IS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WILL TOUCH ON EACH ISSUE. REGARDING CAPITAL OUTLAY IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINETEEN OF YOUR AGENDA THE LIST OF THE ONE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND AND SIX A CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED. ON WE REVIEW THESE PROJECTS -- BACK IN FEBRUARY AND WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH SOME -- THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROVIDE FINAL APPROVAL FOR THESE PROJECTS IN APRIL SO THE PROJECTS ARE APPROVED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE'RE HAPPY IN THE QUEUE NAY IF INTERESTED FOR THE COMMITTEE TO SHARE OUR FULLER ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS OF EACH OF THE PROJECTS. REGARDING THE SECOND ISSUE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OTHER REALLY ARE TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS THE FIRST IS A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND THE SECOND IS THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUNDING THAT YOU SEE IN FIGURE TWENTY EIGHT ON PAGE. NINETEEN SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING BEING PROPOSED THIS YEAR. IS A HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE UNIVERSITY SUBMITTED TO OUR OFFICE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE USED FOR THE FUNDING OF THAT LIST TOTAL A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SO IT WAS A SUCH A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PROPOSED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING. WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO SEE FORGET A MORE -- A COMPREHENSIVE LIST WE HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS ON REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT COULD HELP IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THESE FUNDS ON AND ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND WHICH PROJECTS ARE BEING FUNDED RAPID WORK WITH STAFF ON THAT LANGUAGE. ONE ISSUE THAT A WE DID REYES SPECIFICALLY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS PROPOSING TO FIND -- WHAT'S -- WHAT'S KNOWN AS A FAT INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION ASSESSMENT REPORT -- AND THAT ASSESSMENT BASICALLY LOOKS AT THE CONDITION OF THE CAMPUS IS ROADS UTILITIES ALL OTHER SORT OF ASSOCIATE ENVISIONED FOR STRUCTURE THAT ISN'T RELATED TO FACILITIES. AND THEY'RE PROPOSING SPEND FIVE MILLION OF THAT. FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY CURRENTLY DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR THEIR FACILITIES. ONE OF OUR CHIEF CONCERNS IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY WAS GOING TO USE BOND FUNDING FOR THIS -- REPORT WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A POOR USE OF ON FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY HAS SINCE STATED THAT THEY'LL USE THEIR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THAT AND THAT DOES. ADDRESS A SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN WE HAD WE STILL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS IT'S STILL UNCLEAR TO US WHY EXISTING STAFF. ARE AND WHERE IT CAN'T TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF THEIR IF THE EXISTING CONDITION OF ON CAMPUSES AND OF THE OVERALL EXPENSE OF THE REPORT BUT UNIVERSITY HAS AT LEAST ADDRESSED ONE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN THAT WE HAD. THEN FINALLY -- WE RECOMMEND AND YOU'VE IN THIS COMMITTEE SERVICE RECOMMEND THIS BEFORE SO GO OVER QUICKLY BUT WE RECOMMEND THAT AND AS PART OF FUNDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE UNIVERSITY. TO COME BACK TO IT WITH A LONG TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS MAINTENANCE THE PLAN WOULD. IDENTIFY THE TOTAL COST OF UC'S MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND ALSO PROPOSED A MOVING FORWARD AWAY. TO ENSURE THAT THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG A DOZEN GROWING IT WOULD PROVIDE -- ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH WOULD HAVE TO SPEND EACH YEAR TO PAY DOWN THE BACKLOG AND KEEP IT FROM GROWING. I'M IN THAT WOULD HELP GUIDE FUTURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET DECISIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE APPROPRIATING ONE TIME FUNDING BUT THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ON OF COURSE ARE WHAT THE OVER ARCHING GOAL IS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BACKLOG KEEPS GROWING AND WHETHER OR NOT WORK. WE'LL BE ABLE TO FULLY ADDRESS THE BACKLOG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL DRESSED -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CONCERNS FIRST -- WE HAVE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT -- IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY SMALLER -- AND IT MIGHT EVEN GROW UP MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS -- APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE CAMPUS BUILDINGS ARE OVER THIRTY YEARS IN AGE AND WE'RE REACHING THAT POINT WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILING THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY -- THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IS GROWING SO RAPIDLY ALSO -- WE USED TO HAVE A STATE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE WAY BACK BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WAS A STEADY APPROPRIATION ANNUALLY OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DO MAINTENANCE ON THE CAMPUSES. DUE TO SOME BUDGETARY PRESSURES THAT WAS ENDED -- AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WAS SHIFTED ON THAT THE CAMPUS US NOW -- THE LEGISLATURE HAS AGAIN TURN THIS AROUND -- SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN YOU BEEN PROVIDING US -- WITH ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG BUT DURING THAT TIME. WHEN THE CAMPUSES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR RE DIRECTING SOME OF THEIR OPERATIONAL FUNDING TO IT? TOO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THOSE -- PROJECTS STARTED TO PILE UP AND THEY SER RE TO CRITICAL POINT WHERE -- SYSTEMS NEED TO BE REPLACED ON SOME OF THESE OLDER BUILDINGS WE ARE REQUESTING THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE US WITH HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TOWARD OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WE CAN. EASILY FIND -- THE PROJECTS ON CAMPUSES AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE WELL THE CABINET MEMBERS A LIST OF THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE -- DONE WE'RE ALSO HAPPY TO PROVIDE REPORTING -- TO THE JAIL BC OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE COMPLETE IF THAT WOULD MAKE THE COMMITTEE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE PROGRESS STUFF WE'RE DOING. TOWARDS THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS -- IN REGARDS TO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS -- I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT ON PAGE TWENTY ONE WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING SOME NEW CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. THAT WOULD -- PROVIDE US WITH -- WITH NEW CLASSROOM FACILITIES AND ALSO RESEARCH SPACE FOR OUR CAMPUSES STUFF WE WILL USE OUR INTERNAL BOND AUTHORITY FOR WE ARE REQUESTING ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THE LEGISLATURE TOWARD OUR A. B. -- NINETY FOUR BONDED INDEBTEDNESS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED OF THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THAT -- ARE NOW COMING DUE ON THE BOND AT CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS -- SURE YOU KNOW ONE QUESTION I I JUST. I JUST FOUND INCREDIBLES IS TALKING TO MR MURATSUCHI WHO'S THE ALUMNI. OF UC BERKELEY AS AS IS MY MY FATHER [inaudible] IS THAT. CRAZY AMOUNT -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AT BERKELEY VERSES THE WHOLE UC SYSTEM MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S OF YOUR FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG BERKELEY REPRESENTS ONE OF YOUR TEN CAMPUSES. WILL NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES IT'S SOMETHING LIKE WELL OVER HALF 50% MAYBE TWO THIRDS OF ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION YES YEAH [inaudible] YEAH SO. HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE WHAT IS A HUNDRED YEAH HUNDRED AND SOME MILLION A YEAR. ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT. AND THE CITY BUILDINGS ARE REALLY OLD HI MISSY BURKE WAS AN OLD CAMPUS NOT JUST BERKELEY PER SE BUT WHAT'S OUR OVERALL. PLAN TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE SURE OUR CAMPUSES ARE NUMBER ONE SAFE FOR STUDENTS. IN THOSE OLD BUILDINGS. FOR EXAMPLE ON A FAULT LINE IN BERKELEY. BUT BASICALLY AT HERE TO THE EDUCATION STANDARDS WE NEED FOR STUDENTS. ARE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A SEISMIC -- SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF OUR BUILDINGS WHICH WILL REVEAL MORE ABOUT WHICH BUILDINGS ARE HIGH PRIORITY PARTLY BECAUSE CODES HAVE CHANGED AND SOME OF THE BUILDINGS HAVE GOTTEN OLDER SO THEY ARE NO LONGER -- POTENTIALLY ABLE TO WITHSTAND SOME -- MORE INTENSE EARTHQUAKE SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT THAT SHOULD TELL US MORE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT BUILDINGS NEED TO BE REINFORCED OR TORN DOWN -- BUT IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO TREAT OUR CAMPUSES EQUALLY AND PROVIDE THEM WITH -- WHICH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY THAT REFLECTS THE AGE OF THEIR BUILDINGS BUT THAT PROVIDES EVERY CAMPUS WITH SOME FUNDS SO THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS. WHEN WHEN CERTAIN PROJECTS LIKE ROOF REPLACEMENTS AREN'T ADDRESSED? AND THE WATER STARTS GETTING INTO THE WALLS TO PROJECTS THEN BECOME FAR MORE EXPENSIVE. SO IT IT IS CHEAPER TO TAKE CARE OF SOME PROJECTS ON THE ON THE FRONT END YOU KNOW DO SOME. DO SOME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO THAT DOESN'T GET WORSE LATER ON ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUNDS THAT THE CAMERAS ARE LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IT. THE ISSUE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS PART ON AND OFF COMING OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR FROM THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS A SERIES OF FUNDS THAT WE USE -- TO MANAGE OUR CORE BUDGET OPERATIONS OBVIOUSLY NON RESIDENT TUITION IS ONE OF THEM. AND IF CAMPUSES WERE ABLE TO GROW NON RESIDENTS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE DOC WAY BUT I KNOW. WE HAVE RECEIVED. NO NO NO. BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED DIRECTION FROM THIS COMMITTEE THAT IS NOT YOUR PREFERRED FULL ROUTE SO WE WILL. NOT GO THERE YEAH BUT ALL SERIOUSNESS IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE. YOU KNOW. GOD FORBID THERE'S SOME TRAGEDY WE'VE TO WAKE UP TO LIKE WE SEE WITH. FLOODS AND AND EARTHQUAKES.% NATURAL DISASTERS WITH ON THAT TO HAPPEN -- BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY OLD CAMPUS BUT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE NATION THERE THERE THIS I'M SURE THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE TO ALL OF OUR OLDER UNIVERSITIES ON THE EAST COAST HOW ARE THEY DEALING WITH THEIR DIFFERENT MEANS ISSUES THAT THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ARE DEALING WITH THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES I'M NOT -- CERTAIN. ANOTHER -- POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE WE HAVE IS OUR DONORS ALUMNI EX SPECIALLY BUT SOME WEALTHIER DONORS -- BUT THEY USUALLY WANT TO TEAR DOWN A BUILDING A BUILDING NEW ONE WITH THEIR NAME ON IT SO. WE MADE WE GOT A SEXY DONATION GIVING TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS HER WHO I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOTTEN ANYONE NEW SCIENCE BUILDING A NEW ROOF FOR THE WELL MAYBE IF THE OF THE YOU KNOW NOW I DON'T SAY THAT. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS TWENTY MEMBERS. SEEING NONE -- ISSUE NUMBER. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN OFFICE THE PRESIDENT JUST AND JUST TO RELIEVE THE THE UC PATH INDIVIDUAL HERE. WE ARE WITH THAT'S INFORMATIONAL. NO ACTION IN THE BUDGET AND THAT WE RECEIVE THE INFORMATION FROM THE UC SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT SO. THIS NG OUT -- A PRESENTATION THAT I WILL BE SPEAKING -- TO AS ON REGARDING TO YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET SO I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY REVIEW THE UC OP BUDGET THIS A CONTEXT FOR OUR DISCUSSION ON THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ORGANIZATIONAL OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS. AT THE HEART OF THESE OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS IS ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHAT VALUE DOES YOU C. O. P. ADD TO THE UC SYSTEM BASED ON THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT IT PROVIDES. YOU SEE A PIECE POSITION TODAY AS A SYSTEM WIDE OFFICE IS STRONGER BECAUSE OF OURS ASSESSMENTS AND EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE ORGANIZATIONS FUNCTIONING EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. A PROCESS THAT PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO BEGAN EARLY IN HER TENURE AT U. C. O. P.. THE TOTAL UC OP BUDGET IS EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION AND REPRESENTS TWO POINT BILLION SYSTEM WIDE BUDGET. THE USE UPS SYSTEM WIDE OFFICE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THE MAJORITY OF U. C. O. P. FUND USES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES. PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES AND CENTRAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE% SERVICES THE UC OP BUDGET PRESENTATION TO THE RETURNS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AND TRANSPARENCY. AND INCLUDES THE SUMMARY LEVEL INFORMATION AS WELL AS DETAILED INFORMATION OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR EACH PROGRAM. INITIATIVE AND YOU CO OP DIVISION. ON SITE THREE YOU'LL SEE THAT TOTAL PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION OR 45% OF THE TOTAL YOU SEE -- BE BUDGET A LOT OF THIS BUDGET FLOWS THROUGH YOU COPD CAMPUSES AND OTHER ENTITIES. THE FOUR PROGRAMS NOTED ON THE SLIDE ARE EXAMPLES OF PASSED THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN ON BEHALF OF THE STATE I MAKE UP NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES BUDGET. ON SLIDE. FOR YOU'LL SEE THAT CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ARE ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION OR 43% OF THE UC OP BUDGET. AND THEY SUPPORT SYSTEM WIDE SERVICES ADMINISTERED CENTRALLY -- AND THE UC OP INTERNAL OPERATIONS MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE SUPPORTED BY A FEE FOR SERVICE REVENUES WERE USED TO BE PROVIDES THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. TO ELIMINATE REDUNDANCIES SUCH SUCH AS GENERAL COUNSEL OR TO RETIRE RETIREMENT CENTER. ON SLIDE FIVE YOU'LL SEE THE UC OP BUDGET IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION WHICH IS A DECREASE OF 2%. FROM. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SINCE THE STATE AUDIT WAS RELEASED IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN U. C. O. P. HAS LAUNCH SEVERAL EFFORTS TO CHANGE ITS BUDGET IN PRACTICES. AND THE REVIEW YOU SEE -- P.

ATTACKS THAT HAVE A GOLF COURSE THAT'S OKAY YOU YOU YOU -- CERTAINLY -- YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST OKAY. PLEASE CONTINUE ALRIGHT WHERE WAS I YES I WAS TALKING ABOUT ON SLIDE -- FIVE ACTUALLY -- SO I FIVE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE UC O. P. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED INCLUDED. THAT THE UC OP TOTAL BUDGET WAS REDUCED BY THIRTY THREE MILLION -- IF YOU EXCLUDE YOU SEE PASS AND IF WE INCLUDE THE INCREASE THE UC PASSED CENTER THE BUDGET WAS DECREASED BY ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION -- THIS WAS PART OF A THIRD THE THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION REPRESENTED ELIMINATING ONE TIME TEMPORARY BUDGET THAT YOU SEE -- P. USED TO HAVE AND CREATING A VERY SPECIFIC ACCOUNT FOR THESE PURPOSES TO TRACK THAT -- THE TOTAL ONE TIME BUDGET-- FOR THESE PROJECTS HAS BEEN CUT BY AND LASTLY USE YOUR P. ALLOCATED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CAMPUSES. OF FROM OUR RESERVES OF TO FUND STUDENT HOUSING PRIORITIES ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THOSE WERE THAT WAS A ONE TIME TRANSFERRED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO. ON SLIDE -- SIX YOU'LL SEE THAT AS PART OF THE FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REDUCTION JUST MENTIONED. FUNDS WERE REDIRECTED FOR ENROLLMENT AB NINETY SEVEN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN REQUIRED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE LA -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ASSESS YOU SEE OKAY ELATED PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES TO DETERMINE IF FUNDS COULD BE REDIRECTED FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AFTER REVIEWING SIXTY THREE PROGRAMS WITH MULTIPLE ROUNDS INTERNAL CONSULTATION AMONG UNIVERSITY STAKEHOLDERS. MANY MEETINGS AMONG YOU SEE SACRAMENTO'S STAFF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ASSEMBLY SENATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND THE SUBMISSION OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DOCUMENTS IT WAS AGREED THAT YOU SEE -- P. WOULD PERMANENTLY REDUCE ITS BUDGET BY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND RE DIRECT FIFTEEN MILLION TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT THE CAMPUSES FOR THE SAME FISCAL YEAR. ON SLIDE SEVEN YOU'LL SEE MULTIPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF YOU SEE -- P. THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED THROUGHOUT THE REGION TO RECENT EVALUATIONS ASSESSMENTS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE -- THINGS LIKE OUR FUNCTIONS I FEW COPD PLICATA THAT THE CAMPUS SAYS. ARE YOU STILL BE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S OVERALL MISSION OF PUBLIC INTEREST ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH MISSIONS. IS USE YOUR P. APPROPRIATELY STAFFED WHAT OUTREACH EFFORTS HAS USED CO OP MADE SOLICIT STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AND HAS THE OPTIMIZATION EFFORT HAD AN IMPACT ON TO USE YOU'LL BE BUDGET. OVER THEPAST FEW YEARS U. C. O. P. HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWS. FOR OUT OF THE FIVE REVIEWS YOU SEE LISTED ON SLIDE -- EIGHT WERE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THE STATE AUDIT. THE WHO RUN REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT SO WE DON'T INCLUDE THAT AT THAT -- AS PART OF THAT AUDITS REQUIREMENT A IN GENERAL THE FINDINGS FROM THE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AFFIRMED THAT YOU SEE -- PEAS EXERCISING BEST PRACTICES MEETING INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PERFORMING SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT IS VALUED BY THE CAMPUSES. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED REVIEWS INCLUDED THE PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS AUDIT. WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE REGION'S BY THE STATE AUDITOR TO REVIEW YOU CO. STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES THE PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPER AFFIRMS THE DATA WAS REPRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE AUDITOR FELT THAT THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF THE PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS AUDIT WAS INSUFFICIENT AND ASKED TO RETURNS TO IN PARK ON A REVIEW THAT INCLUDED BUDGETING PROCESS AND RESERVE CONTROLS. AT WHICH POINT TO LLOYD WAS RETAINED. DELOITTE FOUND THAT UC OPIES CONTROLS WERE IN FACT EFFECTIVE. THAN CHAU BURKE AND NEVER SHANK UNDERSTOOD UNDERTOOK A TEN CAMPUS SURVEY AT THE REQUEST OF THE REGION'S TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE CAMPUS PERSPECTIVES. ON THE VALUE LEVEL OF SERVICES PLACEMENT OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS UNDER THE UC ABUSE ROLE AS A SYSTEM WIDE OFFICE. THE REPORT WAS SHARED WITH THE REGION'S AND A WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF THE PRESIDENT CHAIR AND THREE CHANCELLOR'S REVIEWED THE OUTCOMES OF THE REPORT. LITTLE REDUNDANCY WAS FOUND AND CAMPUSES GENERALLY SUPPORTED YOU SEE -- P. AS ADDING VALUE AND SERVICE AND TO THE CAMPUSES AND THE OVERALL MISSION. SULLIVAN CUTTER WAS RETAINED TO LOOK AT THE STAFF COMPENSATION METHODOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ALIGN WITH THE BEST PRACTICES. THEIR FIRM THAT YOU SEE -- PIECE APPROACH THE SALARY RANGE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES MESSED WITH THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE BOARD OF REGENTS ENDORSED THEIR FINDINGS. AND YOU SEE PRESIDENT REQUESTED A REVIEW OF WHO ROBBED MOVE DOWN BY FOUR ON WHO RUN WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT TO LOOK AT THE OPTIMIZATION. AND EFFICIENCY AND PRIMARILY TO ASSESS WHERE CERTAIN UC OP FUNCTIONS MAY BE MOST EFFECTIVELY PERFORMED AT OPG A CAMPUS OR AN INDEPENDENT LOCATION. THE KORAN OPTIONS PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ANALYZE THIS PART OF THE UC OP RESTRUCTURING EFFORT. IN FEW CASES SUCH AS YOU SEE HEALTH IN A ON OUR AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENTAND CHARGED WITH DETERMINING A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH DIVISION. BUT THE EXECUTOR BUDGET COMMITTEE STONE ON THE NEXT SLIDE WAS RECONVENED AS PART OF THE CSA RECOMMENDATIONS THIS BODY INCLUDES CAMPUS REPRESENTATION U. C. O. P. LEADERSHIP AND ACADEMIC SENATE. THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS THE PRESIDENT ON THE U. C. O. P. ANNUAL BUDGET. THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS CONVENED ON FIFTEEN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT OCCASIONS TO DATE. ON THREE OF THESE OCCASIONS THEY HOLD ALL DAY MEETINGS TO DO DEEP DIVES TO EACH OF THE U. C. O. P. DIVISIONS. THIS FORMED A SOLID BASIS OF UNDERSTANDING OF OF THE OVERALL YOU SEE HOPE YOU'RE GONNA STATION WHICH WAS HELPFUL IN GUIDING THEIR DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGH THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROCESS. YOU SEE -- PIAS UNDERGONE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAVE YOU WRAP IT UP WE'RE WAITING FOR THE HONOR. TO PROCEED TO ALL RIGHT -- I THINK WHAT I JUST WANT TO SAY -- IN CONCLUSION IS THAT -- WE HAVE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT -- TO INCREASE OUR TRANSPARENCY AT THIS POINT WE DO FEEL THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE UC OP BUDGET AND WE ARE DOING FAR MORE CONSULTING WITH OUR CAMPUSES WITH SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND RECEIVING MORE INPUT ON WHAT THE UC OP BUDGETS TO THANK YOU LINE ALLOW OUR STATE. AUDITOR THANK YOU I'M COME BACK AND VISIT WITH US. WE STARTED THIS DISCUSSION TWO YEARS AGO AND APPRECIATE -- YOUR WORK THEN IT IT HELPED -- GUY THIS LAST TWO YEARS WITH OUR BUDGET ACTIONS AND FRANKLY. OKAY WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN REDIRECTING SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES TO STUDENTS AND ROLLING MORE CALIFORNIANS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO -- WITH THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU AND THEY SAID HONOR TEAM TO GIVE US AN UPDATE ON PERSPECTIVE ON THE BUDGETING AND PRACTICES OF THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS KATIE CARTING AS AND I AM A SENIOR AUDITOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I WAS A SUPERVISOR ON THE ORIGINAL APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON IT AND HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK ON OUR FOLLOW UP EFFORTS. I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE THE STATUS IF YOU SEE A PEACE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE DUE APRIL. TWENTY NINETEEN SO YOU SEE A P. JUST SUBMITTED THEIR RESPONSES TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO US LAST THURSDAY SO WE'RE CURRENTLY AND WORKING ON ASSESSING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AS OF TODAY. SORANA FOR FOUND MANY ISSUES THAT YOU SEE -- P. INCLUDING A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN UNDISCLOSED RESTRICTING DISCRETIONARY RESERVES. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU SEE -- PETER REALIZE SAVINGS BY ADJUSTING COMPENSATION PAID IT STAFF AND THE ABSENCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ARE ON IT INCLUDED A THREE YEAR PLAN MADE UP OF THIRTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU SEE -- PETE OVER ALL ITS OPERATIONS. THE FIRST YEAR WE WANTED YOU SEE -- P. TO FOCUS ON EVALUATING ITS CURRENT PRIORITIES AND DECISIONS THE SECOND YEAR WE ASKED YOU SEE -- POLICIES AND THE THIRTY YEAR WHICH WOULD BE APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WE WANT YOU SEE -- P. TO MEET THOSE TARGETS AND EVALUATE ITS NEW POLICIES. FOR THE YEAR ONE RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATIONS YOU SEE OPS FULLY IMPLEMENTED EIGHT OF THE TEN THE FULLY IMPLEMENTED RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED YOU SEE OKAY REVIEWING RESTRICTIONS IN COMMITMENTS ON ITS FUNDS. DEVELOPING A METHOD FOR WEIGHING COMPARABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PAY DATA WHEN IT SETTING IT SALARIES. AND DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES. HOWEVER AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN TWO OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS REMAIN PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED THAT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT CAN REALLOCATE TWO CAMPUSES YOU C. O. P. NEEDED TO DEVELOPERS ARE POLICIES THAT GOVERN HOW LARGE IT'S RESERVE SHOULD BE. AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY CAN BE USED. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT FOLLOW UP PUBLISHED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN WE DETERMINED YOU SEE IF YOU COULD NOT PROVIDE POLICIES FOR PROGRAM SPECIFIC RESERVES TOTALING A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO CONCLUDED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT RESERVE POLICIES -- THAT IDENTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO HANDLE EXCESS FUND BALANCES YOU SEE STAKEHOLDERS WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT PORTION OF FUND BALANCES COULD POTENTIALLY BE REALLOCATED THE CAMPUSES. LAST WEEK YOU SEE A PIECE AMENDED GUIDELINES RELATED TO ITS RESERVES THAT WERE CURRENTLY ASSESSING. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION DUE IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRED YOU SEE -- PETE IMPLEMENTOR RECOMMENDED ONE PAGE BUDGET PRESENTATION BUT WE HAVE RATED THIS RECOMMENDATION IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THE BUDGET PRESENTATION CONTINUES TO LACKS SUFFICIENT TRANSPARENCY. ESPECIALLY AROUND YOU SEE -- PEAS OR SERVICE. TO ME THE INTENT OF OUR RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THE CLEARLY DISPLAY THE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS FUNDS IT HAS AT THE END OF EACH YEAR IF WE BELIEVE THE FUND BALANCES IN RESERVES NEED TO BE PRESENTED ON THE SAME SCHEDULE AS REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE TIMING OF YOU SEE A PIECE BUDGET WHICH THE REGION'S WILL PROVE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS HINDERS THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS. FOR YOUR TWO RECOMMENDATIONS YOU SEE OF HE IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THREE OF THE ELEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE. THIS IMPLEMENTED BEST PRACTICES FOR BUDGETING BY DEVELOPING A ROBUST INTERNAL BUDGET MANUAL. IT'S PUBLISHED ITS REVIEW OF THUNDERSTRUCK SHINS AND COMMITMENTS AND IS ALSO PUBLISHES RESULTS OF ITS REVIEW OF SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES. THERE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SEE A P. RESPONDED TO TO US LAST WEEK INCLUDE BUDGETING RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO PRESENTING A COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET TO THE REGION'S THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. STAFFING RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO ADJUSTING IT SALARIES ACCORDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMPARISON RESULTS NEARING ITS SALARY RANGES AND DEVELOPING A WORK FORCE PLAN. FINALLY WE HAVE ALSO ASKED YOU SEE A P. TO ESTABLISH SPENDING TARGETS FOR SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS WELL AS TO CREATE A PLAN FOR REALLOCATING FUNDS THAT IT SAVES. TWO CAMPUSES AS IT REDUCES ITS COSTS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL DELVE INTO THE FINAL YEAR OF OUR THREE YEAR PLAN WHICH WILL REQUIRE YOU SEE YOU SEE A P. TO EVALUATE ITS PRACTICES. REALLOCATE FUNDS TO CAMPUSES AND PUBLICLY REPORT ON ITS PROGRESS. WE RECOGNIZE YOU SEE -- PEAS RESOURCE INVESTMENT IN PROGRESS THUS FAR IN IMPLEMENTING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS BY IMPROVING ITS FISCAL STAFFING AND SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVE PROCESS SEES. HOWEVER YOU SEE A P. STILL NEEDS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT SEVERAL KEY RECOMMENDATIONS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR REPORT. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I I GUESS THE THE MAIN QUESTION I ASK IS THAT CAN YOU GO OVER AGAIN THE NUMBER YOU THROUGHOUT HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION SO. OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND INSIGHT FROM THE AUDIT TWO YEARS AGO BUT ONE LARGEST TAKEAWAYS FROM OUR COMMITTEE WAS. THEIR RESOURCES AT THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT WHILE THEY YOU KNOW MAY LOOK GOOD ON PAPER. THEY COULD BE BETTER UTILIZED ON CAMPUS AS WE HEARD EARLIER THAT STUDENTS HAVE ENOUGH FOOD. HOMELESS SLEEPING IN CARS SO THOSE ARE PRIOR IS IT AS WELL AS ALWAYS OUR TOP ONE ROLLING MORE CALIFORNIANS SO -- WHAT WHAT IS YOUR CONCLUSION THERE AGAIN AS FAR AS WHAT WE THINK IS -- DISCRETIONARY AND AVAILABLE AT THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT THAT ONE TWENTY TWO MILLION NUMBER. SEVEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION IS RESERVES THAT YOU SEE A P. DIDN'T HAVE POLICIES FOR AS OF FEBRUARY -- TWENTY NINETEEN THE AMOUNT THAT WE NEED AND WE DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU SEE OKAY EXTENSIVELY AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THE AMOUNT THAT THEY SAW AS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR REALLOCATION WAS NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION. AND THAT'S DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT YOU SEE -- HE WAS HOLDING FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES. THAT WAS FOR THEIR INITIATIVE AND ONE TWENTY TWO WAS. AN OVERALL. CORRECT MOST OF THOSE ARE PROGRAM SPECIFIC RESERVES SO -- THEY'RE NOT RESTRICTED LEGALLY UNDER ANY TYPE OF STATE LAW YOUR ACCOUNTING STANDARD BUT THEY'RE RESTRICTED FOR PURPOSES USUALLY DESIGNATED BY THE REGENTS AND AGAIN THERE'S ONGOING MONEY EVERY YEAR FOR THESE INITIATIVES BUT THIS IS KIND. OF SPARE CHANGE EVERY YEAR ADDED UP. CORRECT AND THE EIGHT DAYS SO FAR IT'S BEEN INTERESTING AT AT THE TIME OF THE ON A WE SAW A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUND BALANCES IN RESERVES -- AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THAT NUMBER WAS UP AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION AND PART OF THAT IS THAT YOU CO OP HAS GONE THROUGH CLEAN UP ITS ACCOUNTS IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL MONEY AND FUND BALANCES. SO IT'S NOT A COMPLETE APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON TO LOOK AT THOSE TWO NUMBERS BUT OUR OUR CONCERN THAT WE EXPRESS IN FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THAT YOU SEE -- P. NEED AND BETTER POLICIES AROUND ENSURING THAT ITS RESERVES OR APPROPRIATE. YES THE BEG THE QUESTION YOU KNOW WHY CAN'T WE USE THOSE MONIES FOR OTHER UC PRIORITIES. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT UC BERKELEY -- ONE TIME MONEY FOR STUDENT NEEDS AND AND HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS EMERGENCY GRANTS AND SO -- YOU SEE. SOME OF THE RESERVES ARE NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY SUPPORT YOU HAVE TO HAVE -- IT'S COMMON TO HAVE OF EXPRESSLY FOR REVOLVING FUNDS THAT -- IT'S COMMON TO HAVE. RESERVES THAT CAN BE UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IF REVENUES ARE NOT COMING IN AT THE PACE STUFF WAS ANTICIPATED -- I'M NOT OF FAMILIAR WITH THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED BY THE AUDITOR AND I WILL HAVE TO GET MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT. YEAH. WELL IT JUST SEEMS THAT -- WE HAD THIS ISSUE TWO YEARS AGO. AND THE ARGUMENT WAS -- NO THOSE ARE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR THOSE ARE ALL NEEDED WORK WE REALLY NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE RESERVES AND TWO YEARS LATER WE COME BACK AND WE STILL HAVE. THAT AND YOU KNOW. THE NOTION THAT WE NEEDED IN CASE MONIES DON'T COME THROUGH A CERTAIN TIME KIND OF FAR THAT FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE THE PRESIDENT BUDGET IS. CLOSE TO BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. TWO HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED SOMETHING MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TOTAL TWENTY SIX BILLION OUR ENTERPRISE AND SO. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE RUNNING A CASH FREE TIME -- SO JUST BEGS THE QUESTION AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT THESE PRIORITIES ARE NUMBER ONE THE RIGHT PRIORITIES. FOR OTHER NEEDS THROUGHOUT. THE UC SYSTEM. AND NUMBER TWO EVEN IF THEY ARE THE RIGHT PRIORITIES. THESE RESERVES ARE STILL IN PLACE. WE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE RESERVES AND WE DID IDENTIFY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE THOUGHT. COULD REASONABLY BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING PROGRAMS -- AND THOSE TRANSFERS ALREADY TOOK PLACE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME MONEY HERE I DO ONE GRAMS A SO YESDOT -- SO IN TERMS OF USING THAT FOR ENROLLMENT THE DIFFICULTY THERE ABOUT INSANE I SAID. STUDENT NEEDS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE NINE MILLION SORRY. DON'T HAVE THERE ARE THERE ARE ONGOING PROGRAMS IN THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT MISTER TIPS WHICH WE'VE ALWAYS -- INQUIRE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ONGOING PROGRAMS ARE WORTHY WHEN YOU. LOOK AT THE TRADE OFFS FOR ENROLLMENT IF YOU ASK MARKETS MY CONSTITUENTS. YOU KNOW THIS WEEK IN THE LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD HEY THIS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT IS DOING X. Y. Z.. AND AND I GUESS -- BUT NONE OF THE KIDS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD CUT IN THE UC THIS YEAR AND GETTING EXPAND ROMAN BYE. BYE ONE ADDITIONAL SLOT SO. THOSE ARE TRADE OFFS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. MR MESSAGING YES I I WANTED TO LITTLE. CLARIFICATION THE ARMS OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. OR SO THAT YOU IDENTIFIED THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE THE POLICIES FOR THE RESERVES IT WAS AT YOUR THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN MY POLICIES. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT YOU SEE A P. ESTABLISH POLICIES GUIDING WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE RESERVE LOOKING AT AND WHAT SOME ACCEPTABLE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM FOR THOSE RESERVES ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CASE THAT THERE'S ACCESS -- RESERVES SO SO THERE WASN'T EVEN. A AND IDENTIFIED PURPOSE FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES. NOT NOW WITHIN A POLICIES SO SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE A PURPOSE FOR THE PROGRAM BUT NOT IN TERMS OF THE RESERVE WHAT WHAT OKAY SO THAT SAYS RESERVE IT BE A PURPOSE IDENTIFIED PURPOSE FOR THE PROGRAM. BUT NOT FOR THE RESERVE CORRECT Là BUT PRESUMABLY IT WAS A RESERVE FOR THE PROGRAM. AND SO THE IT WAS IT WAS A RESERVE TO BE INTENDED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM CORRECT AND I THINK WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR FROM YOU SEE -- P. WAS MORE SPECIFICITY AROUND WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT FOR THIS RESERVE OKAY AND IF YOUR IF YOU'RE KEEPING A RESERVE -- WHEN WOULD YOU IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY IN THAT RESERVE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REALLOCATED TO A DIFFERENT PROGRAM SORRY SO SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? THEIR THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SOME MORE CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE THE THE THE THE ACCOUNTING OF OF THE OF THE FUNDS THAT'S BUT IN TERMS OF THE IT THERE IN EACH. THE DOLLAR OF THOSE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN RESERVES HAD A IDENTIFIED PURPOSE FOR PROGRAM. THEY WERE TIED DIRECTLY TO THE PROGRAM YES. SO IT'S NOT. LIKE IT WAS A ON IDENTIFIED SLUSH FUND. BUT HOW IT WORKS WE'RE NOT CALLING IT THAT BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS IT'S RESERVE IT POTENTIALLY COULD STAY THERE OR BE UTILIZED FOR OTHER SURE YOU SEE NEEDS ON A ONE TIME. ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- SIR CAN I POINT OUT THAT OUR REGION STOOD ADOPT A POLICY ON JANUARY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON OUR RESERVES -- THAT REQUIRES -- THAT THE RESERVES NOT EXCEED THREE POINT 5% OF THE TOTAL FUNDS THAT IN THE PROGRAMS WITHOUT COMING BACK TO THE REGION'S THEM. WHEN WHAT'S THE? PERCENTAGE HERE WITH THE ONE TWENTY TWO NINE I'M NOT CERTAIN. I SEEMS PROBABLY MORE THAN. THREE POINT 5% RIGHT -- I'M POSSIBLY NOT I DON'T KNOW. THE WHOLE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGETS EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SIR YOUR INITIATIVES. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT YEAH MATH DOESN'T ADD UP. OKAY MIXTURE THIS MESSAGE YEP THANK YOU -- DIE I WANTED -- TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF THE THE CENTRAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PIE CHART THAT YOU PROVIDE. LIKE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY. IN YOUR ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE SECRETARY THE REGION'S. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT? I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION. ON THE PIE CHART FOR TO SIGN ON YOUR CHARTER SERVICES ON YOUR CHART THERE IS A LINE ITEM THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SECRETARY OF THE REGION'S. YES THAT'S THE OFFICE THAT MANAGES THE REGENTS THAT GETS THEM THEIR INFORMATION BOOKSTORE TRAVEL -- MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE PUBLICATIONS FOLLOW ALL THE PROPER GUIDELINES THAT'S WHERE OUR AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION ALSO. A LOT OF OUR SYSTEM WIDE -- AUDIT COMPLIANCE IS RUN OUT OF IN ORDER TO BE INDEPENDENT FROM THE REST OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. HOW MANY HOW MANY EMPLOYEES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SECRETARY THE REASONS? I DO NOT KNOW I I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME HOW MANY EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE REGIONS. THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE HAS A FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE OF FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET. THAT'S CORRECT AND AND AND WHAT WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT -- TO THAT IS T. ANALYSTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT WHO ARE HELPING TO RUN THE WHO. WORK ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THE SYSTEM WIDE OFFICES UNDERTAKING THAT WILL THEN HAND OFF -- TO CAMPUSES USUALLY -- THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FOR EXAMPLE -- WAS THE ONE THAT GENERATED ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS CENTERS. AND THEY DID A LOT OF THAT ANALYSIS AND GOT WORKED WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO GET THEM STARTED -- SO THERE SEVERAL ANALYSTS THERE WHO WORK ON HIGH PRIORITY SYSTEM WIDE ISSUES THAT ARE GETTING LAUNCHED -- AND THEY SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. AND THEN SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE. BUT WHAT IS THAT. I WILL GET YOU INFORMATION ON THE MISSION STATEMENT SOME PURPOSES OF EACH OF THESE OFFICES. I DON'T HAVE THE MISSION STATEMENTS AND EXACT -- TASKS OF EACH OFFICE IN FRONT OF ME. THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS IS THAT FOR THE PENSION -- YES THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S TO RUN THE UC PENSION AND ALSO -- ARE YOU SEEN DOWN MEANT. AND THEN FIFTY ONE POINT FIVE FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS WITH THE YOU KNOW THE GENERAL NATURE OF THAT. OUR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS IS WHERE WE DO THE IT'S WHERE WE HAVE OUR APPLICATIONS STUDENT APPLICATIONS THAT THEY DO ACADEMIC POLICY FOR THE UNIVERSITY THE ACADEMIC SENATE THIS LOCATED THERE ARE SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC SENATE -- AND THEY THEY WORK ON A MULTITUDE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ACADEMIC MISSION -- OKAY I YEAH I I I WOULD I WOULD LIKE MORE. DETAILED. INFORMATION ON I I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT WELL VERSED IN THIS THE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO USUALLY WORK ON THIS BUDGET ARE -- WHAT FOR NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TODAY OKAY? NUMBER I WILL BRING EXPERTS BY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE FOLLOW UP FROM YOU AFTER YOU DO THE AS FAR AS THE THAT. THEIR TRADITIONAL. A FOLLOW UP FROM THE AUDIT PROCESS FOR IS IT. A FEW YEARS I THINK WE ALERTED DISARRAY YEAH THAT'S CORRECT SO THE APRIL TWENTY NINETEEN ASSESSMENT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW -- I CAN LET. THE THE COMMITTEE KNOW WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THAT IS THAT THE FINAL ASSESSMENT -- WE'RE ANTICIPATING AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT TO LOOK INTO THE APRIL TWENTY TWENTY RECOMMENDATIONS NEXT YEAR. FINAL OKAY ONE MORE FROM YOU AND SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS WHEN YOU DO THIS REVIEW HE SENT A REPORT OUT TO LEGISLATURE WITH THE FINDINGS IN -- SO WE PUBLISH IT ONLINE AND THERE'S ANOTHER REPORT THAT COMES ON JANUARY OF EVERY YEAR THAT. SUMMARIZES ARE ALL OF THE ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL THE ON IT SO WE DO. BUT IT'LL BE PUBLISHED ONLINE MUCH SOONER THAN THAT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION AND WE WILL CONSIDER THIS AS WE FINALIZE OUR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET FOR THE UC. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSSING THE UC. PATH PROJECT YEAH. IS ONE OF THE OKAY. GOOD EVENING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET THE TRAFFIC THAN OUT EVEN FURTHER -- THIS EVENING UP TODAY'S UPDATE IS VERY SHORT AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO UP BRING YOU UP TO SPEED BASED ON THE BRIEFING WE PROVIDED LAST YEAR. SLIDE TO THIS DECK IS JUST A IT'S A KIND OF A CENTERING POINT FOR WHAT YOU SEE PATH IS. THE NAME ITSELF CONTAINS AN ACRONYM OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS SO IT'S A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES FOR PAYROLL. ACADEMIC PERSONNEL TIME KEEPING AN HR. THROUGH A SHARED SERVICES CENTER IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA -- PROVIDING ULTIMATELY. PAYROLL H. R. BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR ALL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND YOU SEE EMPLOYEES -- IF YOU LOOK AT SLIDE THREE IN THE DECK -- THIS REALLY SHOWS OUR PROGRESS LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS HERE WE HAD JUST OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WHO HAD TRANSITION TO UC PATH -- AS OF MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE ADDED -- PROXIMATE LEE SEVENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL POINTS ARE EIGHTY THOUSAND DIGITAL BOYS WERE NOW JUST OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES SERVE BY YOU SEE PATH. ULTIMATELY THE TARGET IS ALL TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. THAT SECOND SLIDE ALSO THEN DEMONSTRATES THE REMAINING DEPLOYMENTS -- BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME WE FINISH THE DEPLOYMENT PART OF THIS INITIATIVE -- IN IN THOSE WE HAVE FOUR REMAINING DEPLOYMENTS WILL BRING DAVIS IN THE AG AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM LIVE THIS FALL -- WITH AN OCTOBER FIRST PAYCHECK. AND THEN THE REMAINING LOCATIONS ARE INTENT IS TO HAVE ALL OF THEM READY. TO TO MOVE TO YOU SEE PASSED BY DECEMBER. BUT TO SPREAD OUT THE DEPLOYMENTS -- IN AN EFFORT TO SMOOTH THE TRANSITION FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WORKING WITH THE UC PATH CENTER. WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN QUITE A BIT AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROJECT -- AND ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT ADDS THE HIGHEST VALUE AND QUALITY. OF FOR CAMPUS MOVING TO YOU SEE PATH IS -- DIMINISHING THE SIZE OF THE DEPLOYMENT POPULATION SO YOU SEE FOR REMAINING DEPLOYMENTS. THOSE ARE ALL AT SMALLER POPULATIONS THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY PROJECTED OF THE FINAL DEPLOYMENT BEING IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY CELESTIN YOU'RE FROM NOW ARE ARE PROJECT -- ARE PROJECTED IN DATE -- WILL HAVE OCCURRED -- ALONG THE WAY -- WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES AND SPECIFICALLY. YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES WITH STUDENT PAY AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THIS NEXT SLIDE -- TALKING TO WHAT -- THOSE ISSUES INVOLVED. AS WE'VE DEPLOYED IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE EARLY DEPLOYMENTS WE PICKED SMALLER CAMPUSES WITH RELATIVELY LESS COMPLEX PAYROLL POPULATIONS -- BECAUSE WE WERE ROLLING OUT NEW SOFTWARE -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH SMALLER CAMPUSES TO WORK OUT ISSUES. THE MERCED IN RIVERSIDE DEPLOYMENT IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY ALL ACCOUNTS WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT OVER TIME WE DISCOVERED WE HAD A NUMBER OF SMALL. I DEFECTS THAT IMPACTED GRADUATE STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR -- AS IT RELATED TO THEIR FIKE ELIGIBILITY AND PER YEAR EARLIER CONVERSATIONS THIS EVENING -- GRADUATE STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE AMONG THE MOST COMPLEX -- EMPLOYEE PAY SITUATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MANAGING THE UNIVERSITY. GRAD STUDENTS HAVE UP MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS THAT THE KERRY SIMULTANEOUSLY THOSE APPOINTMENTS CAN BE A COMBINATION OF BI WEEKLY AND MONTHLY JOBS -- THOSE KINDS OF PACE CYCLES GENERATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEDUCTION REQUIREMENTS. AND THEY CHANGE JOBS MORE OFTEN THAN ANY YOU SEE EMPLOY THEY CAN CHANGE JOBS MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE TERM. UP SO THEY ALL OF THOSE CHANGES -- TEND TO COMBINE TO CREATE -- A PROCEDURAL -- CHALLENGES FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO MANAGE -- AT A DID DISCOVER SYSTEM DEFECTS EARLY ON THOSE WERE ALL FIXED BY AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONG THE WAY WE BEGAN TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE GRADUATE STUDENT. POPULATIONS -- BECAUSE WE FOUND THE CAMPUSES WERE TREATING THEM AS REGULAR STAFF EMPLOYEES IN GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE VERY UNIQUE. CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY'VE HAD TYPICALLY NON -- ADMINISTRATIVE PATHWAYS TO RESOLVE PAY PROBLEMS WHEN THEY ARISE SO A GRAD STUDENT FOR EXAMPLE THE CENTER OF THEIR UNIVERSE IS THERE DEPARTMENT. BUT A TYPICAL EMPLOY WOULD GO TO PAYROLL DEPARTMENT IF THEY HAD A PAY PROBLEM GRADUATE STUDENTS GO TO THEIR HOME DEPARTMENT SO WE'VE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT SERVICES AND BETTER COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS SO THAT IF AND WHEN A STUDENT HAS A PAY PROBLEM. WE CAN GET IT RESOLVED MORE QUICKLY -- AND THEY'RE PUT UNDER LESS FINANCIAL STRESS -- WE HAD ANOTHER DEPLOYMENT TO LOS ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA LAST SEPTEMBER -- WE DIDN'T HAVE SYSTEM PROBLEMS AT THAT POINT BUT THE SCALE OF THAT DEPLOYMENT. OF RESOLVE SOME PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT WE SINCE -- RESULT I WOULD OBSERVE THAT WE'VE ALSO NOW DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO REALLY HELP ANYONE WHO IS A PAY PRBLEM YOU SEE. FIRST THING WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE BEGUN. ISSUING WHAT WE CALL PAY CARDS THESE ARE PRE LOADED DEBIT CARDS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO EMPLOY IF WE FIND OUT THERE'S A PAY PROBLEM WE CAN GET THEM PAID THE NEXT DAY WITH A PAY CARD THAT THEY CAN PICK UP ON CAMPUS. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CHECK -- WE HAVE ALSO -- BEGUN -- OTHER PROCEDURES WORKING WITH CAMPUSES IF IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS. AN AMOUNT OF THEIR PAY BUT NOT THE FULL PAY TO GET TO THE NEXT PAY PERIOD WE'VE WORKED OUT THOSE PROCEDURES AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD OBSERVE THAT -- WE ARE WE HAVE NOW A SMALL UNIT WITHIN THE PAST CENTER. THAT IS COMPLETELY DEDICATED TO RESOLVING ANY KIND OF STUDENT PAY ISSUE ONCE WERE AWARE OF IT WE HAVE A TIGER TEAM -- THEY CAN RESOLVE IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR THAT STUDENT -- THE OTHER OF THE PROGRESS THAT I WOULD OBSERVE IN OUR PAY IN OUR DEPLOYMENTS. WE DEPLOYED BERKELEY IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR SO WE ADDED ANOTHER ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES TO YOU SEE PATH -- THAT HAS BEEN OUR MOST EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT TO DATE -- WHEREAS WITH THE OTHER CAMPUSES WE HAD A BIG SPIKE IN CALLS TO THE UC PASSED CENTER -- WITH SPECIFIC ISSUES OUR INITIAL TWO MONTHS WORKING WITH BERKELEY -- WHO ARE NOW ROUGHLY 2425% OF THE PERIL POPULATION? THEY'RE GENERATING LESS THAN 19% OF THE CASES THAT COME INTO THE UC PATH CENTER. SO PROPORTIONATELY WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH BERKELEY AND WE'VE HAD WITH PREVIOUS DEPLOYMENTS SO WE'RE APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED FROM EACH OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS -- IN PARTICULAR THE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN TO WORK WITH STUDENT GROUPS DIRECTLY TO COMMUNICATE THE CHANGES TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET SUPPORT IF THEY HAVE ISSUES. AND TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE DOING TRANSACTION DATA ENTRY TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING. ALL OF THOSE COMBINED -- HAVE WORKS TO IMPROVE -- OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER STUDENT PAY ACCURATELY AND ON TIME. AND I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT WITHIN THAT ACCURATELY ON TIME -- OUT OF THE GATE WERE ROUGHLY 98299% -- AND SO WE'RE DEALING WITH A ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WHERE WE FIND. SOME ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED ROUGHLY 42405% OF THOSE CASES ARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CAMPUS HAS NOT SUBMITTED TIME CORRECTLY. THE THE TIME FILES FOR THEFOR THE EMPLOYEES ON TIME OR ACCURATELY WE HAVE TO GO BACK RESULT THE TIME FILES ONCE WE DO THAT -- THE PAY IS FINE. BOB AS A FINAL STEP I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE STUDENT PAY ISSUES WE HAD -- HAD VISIBILITY WITH THE PRESIDENT SHE HAS CONVENED A STUDENT PAY WORKING GROUP. THAT HAS -- AN OBLIGATION TO DELIVER A REPORT TO HER BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. WITH RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY AROUND IMPROVING PAY FOR STUDENTS IN THE SHORT TERM AND BY THAT SHE MEANS. ANY IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE IN TIME FOR THE DAVIS AN A AND R. DEPLOYMENT THIS FALL. AND THEN LONGER TERM ARE THERE POLICY ISSUES THAT THE UNIVERSITY USES. THAT MAKES STUDENT PAY MORE COMPLEX THAN IT NEEDS TO BE. AND OTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN PURSUE A TO SIMPLIFY OR OR REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF STUDENT PAY. IN EXAMPLE I WOULD GIVE THERE IS AROUND PAY PERIODS AND AGAIN WITH THE GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPETING MONTHLY. AND BI WEEKLY PAY PERIODS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. DOES IT CONTINUE TO MAKE SENSE TO HAVE STUDENT POSITIONS. THAT LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT PAY CYCLES SHOULD WE CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE ALL STUDENT PLAYS HAVE IN COMMON PAY CYCLE WHICH WOULD REDUCE THAT COMPLEXITY. SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT THIS STUDENT PAY WORKING GROUP IS LOOKING AT AND WILL DELIVER IN THEIR REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT IN JUNE. OKAY. UP IN THE NEXT SLIDE A ONE OF A JUST QUICKLY REVIEW OUR CURRENT YEAR -- FORECAST -- AND COMPARED TO OUR BUDGET. INITIALLY THE BUDGET THAT. WAS APPROVED FOR THIS YEAR WAS SIXTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AND IN THE ALLOCATION THAT -- WHILE WE WERE PROVIDED THERE WAS A A BASE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUNDS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. US AID A CHARGE BACK TO THE CAMPUSES -- THROUGH A CAMPUS ASSESSMENT FOR ANY REMAINING EXPENSE. OUR CURRENT FORECAST FOR THE YEAR IS UP TO SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- SO WE SUBMITTED A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO DO F. R. D. O. F. APPROVED THAT A CHANGE. AND SO WE ARE NOW COMMUNICATING WITH THE CAMPUS IS -- WHO WILL BEAR THAT ADDITIONAL -- COMPONENT IN THEIR ASSESSMENT THIS YEAR. THAT A POINT TWO MILLION REALLY -- CENTERED AROUND THE DEBT SERVICE AMOUNT THAT YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE -- TABLE ON SLIDE -- FIVE WE HAD PROJECTED SOME SAVINGS FORM ARE HOSTING COSTS FOR THE TECHNICAL SOLUTION FOR YOU SEE PATH. THAT DID NOT -- A MATERIALIZE THIS YEAR. AND THEN WITH THE LA IN SANTA BARBARA DEPLOYMENT WE HAD SOME ADDITIONAL STABILIZATION COSTS WHICH ARE REALLY LABOR COSTS -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT DROVE -- THE CHANGE FROM THE BUDGET INTO THE FORECAST THIS YEAR -- OF AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- WERE REALLY LOOKING AT THE SAME -- OPERATING BUDGET THE OPERATING BUDGET FOR YOU SEE PATH IS -- PART OF WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -- BUDGET -- THAT'S BEEN SUBMITTED -- SO THE INFORMATION THAT'S HERE IS REALLY -- A DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT'S IN THE UC O. P. PRESENTATION -- BUT IT'S HERE JUST AS A AS A WAY OF SIGNALING UP SMALL CHANGES IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS LINE ITEMS HERE BUT ROUGHLY LANDING IN THE SAME SPOT AT THIS POINT -- THE DEBT SERVICE -- IS SOMETHING THAT SELL A HOLD OVER FROM OUR PROJECT THE PROJECT WAS FUNDED INITIALLY WITH A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR BOND IT'S A TWENTY YEAR BOND. THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THAT OR DEBT I'M SORRY ARE -- INTEREST ONLY PAYMENTS. AND IN YOUR FIVE WHICH WILL BE FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO UP THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL KICK IN. FINALLY ON THIS LAST SLIDE -- IS ACTUALLY A VIEW OF THE PROJECT EXPENSES WHAT IT'S COST THE UNIVERSITY. TO BRING YOU SEE PATH INTO PRODUCTION -- OUR OVERALL FORECAST FROM BEGINNING TO END FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU SEE PATH. WITH CENTRAL EXPENSES IS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO DATE AS OF CLOSE OF OF MONTH FOR MARCH WHICH SPENT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION OF THAT WE HAVE SIXTY FOUR POINT TWO REMAINING. BETWEEN NOW IN THE THE END OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NOTE THESE COSTS ARE FUNDED DIRECTLY THROUGH A CAMPUS ASSESSMENT -- THIS IS NOT AN OPERATING EXPENSE THESE ARE CAPITALIZED EXPENSES -- SO -- IT'S HANDLED DIRECTLY THROUGH THAT ASSESSMENT -- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN COLLECTING THE CAMPUS COMPONENT OF EXPENSE. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXERT DIRECT MANAGEMENT OVERTHOSE EXPENSES SO WE EVERY SIX MONTHS WE ASK THE CAMPUSES TO UPDATE US ON THEIR FORECAST EXPENDITURES IN SUPPORTING THE LOCAL COMPONENT OF YOU SEE PATH DEPLOYMENT -- THEY'VE REPORTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SPENT TO DATE -- AND BURKE A FOR CASTING AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY SIX POINT EIGHT TO CLOSE OUT THE CAMPUS COMPONENT OF THIS DEPLOYMENT. FOR TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN SO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT'S THE UPDATE ON YOU SEE PATH BE DELIGHTED TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. AT MY REQUEST I'M GLAD YOU CAUGHT ME YEAH. OF AND I THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE THAT I GOT -- IN RIVERSIDE ON THE PAST -- I THINK BACK IN DECEMBER JANUARY OF THIS YEAR -- AND AND FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE. I I WANT TO POINT OUT THE UC PATH IS LOCATED -- IN RIVERSIDE. A FEW MILES FROM THE UC OUR CAMPUS BUT NOT ON THE CAMPUS. AND SO IT IT IT OPERATES. INDEPENDENTLY REALLY OF THE CAMPUS OF UC ARE CORRECT. BUT I DID GET TO GO TO THE RIBBON CUTTING. CEREMONY -- FOR FOR FIVE YEARS AGO. SIX I THINK YEAH SIX YOUR HONOR -- YES SIX YEARS AGO. AND THERE'S AN IRONY ABOUT THIS THIS PROJECT. AND IT'S IT'S NOT A GOOD IRONY -- IF YOU LOOK HERE AT AT OUR BACKGROUND MATERIAL ADDITION ON ISSUE. EIGHT THE UC PATH WAS ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT CAME OUT OF COST SAVINGS. SO THAT YOU SEE PATH AND THE IDEA OF CENTRALIZING. OF PAYROLL FOR YOU SEE WAS SEEN AND PROPOSED TO US AS A COST SAVER. A WAY OF CENTRALIZING AND SAVING MONEY. IN HERE ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN IT SAYS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS -- AS IT WAS PRESENTED TO US. SIX YEARS AGO. OF CENTRALIZING PAYROLL OF BUT BUT IN AN ALSO HERE IT SAYS THE PROJECT IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COSTLIER THAN THE FIRST ESTIMATE. WHICH WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST ESTIMATE. OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION. AND THE AND THE TOTAL CLASS. TODAY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION. SO THE DIFFERENCE. BASICALLY -- A CLOSE I DO THE MATH IN MY HEAD. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE. ROUGHLY ROUGHLY. AND NO COST SAVINGS [inaudible] AT ALL. RIGHT NO NO NO COST SAVINGS AT ALL MOVING FORWARD -- IT IS THE THE THE IRONY TO ME IS YOU KNOW THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A COST SAVER. IS SO MUCH MORE OVER BUDGET -- WHEN IT IS OVER? WHEN IT'S OVER AND ALL THE THE CAMPUSES ARE BROUGHT? ONLINE. WILL IT SAVE ANY MONEY TO YOU SEE. SO THAT CAN I OFFER AN ANSWER THAT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS TO WORK THROUGH. THE ANSWER IS OVER TIME THE POTENTIAL EXISTS SO WHAT WE STARTED WITH. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF A PAYROLL SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN IN PRODUCTION FOR FORTY YEARS. SO ALL ELEVEN OF THOSE HAVE A COMMON CORE OF OF DOING PAYROLL BUT ALL ELEVEN HAVE BEEN HEAVILY CUSTOMIZED BY THE CAMPUS IS OVER TIME. AND THE UNIVERSITY INCREASINGLY. FINALLY HAD TROUBLE ACTUALLY DELIVERING PAYROLL SO THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH STAYING WHERE WE WERE -- BUT WE ALSO HAD -- INCREASING COMPLIANCE ISSUES IN MEETING IN PARTICULAR FEDERAL -- REGULATORY OF COMPLIANCE -- YOU SEE. OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON FEDERAL RESEARCH DOLLARS FOR PORTION OF ITS BUSINESS. THOSE RESEARCH DOLLARS COME WITH VERY HIGH COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS INCREASINGLY YOU SEE WAS NOT ABLE TO MEET THOSE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING. I CONCUR THAT THE PROJECT WAS OVERSOLD AT THE BEGINNING. THAT WAS A BUSINESS DECISION BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNIVERSITY -- PROBABLY HELPED OUT BY A VERY AMBITIOUS A CONSULTING FIRM THAT -- WAS QUICKLY REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT -- BUT TO GET TO EFFICIENT TO GET TO EFFICIENCIES WHICH IS WHERE WE GET THE SAVINGS. WE HAD TO SPEND. A COUPLE OF YEARS WORKING WITH THE LOCATIONS THE CAMPUSES ON STANDARDIZING THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS. EVERY CAMPUS HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF HIRING PEOPLE EVERY CAMPUS HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF EXTENDING. BY ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENTS. FOR FOR NOTE TAKERS IN CLASSROOMS IN SO STANDARDIZING. THE CLASSIFICATIONS WE WERE USING STANDARDIZING HOW WE DO HIRES AND TERMINATIONS AND PROMOTIONS AND MERITS. SO THAT FROM ONE LOCATION TO THE NEXT IT WAS A REPEATABLE PREDICTABLE EXPERIENCE. WAS A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THIS PROJECT. TO GET TO EFFICIENCY YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET YOUR STANDARDIZATION AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGER ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE. EVERY CAMPUS NOW DOES HIRING THE SAME WAY ONCE THERE AND YOU SEE PATH. THEY MANAGE -- EMPLOYEES IN POSITIONS AND VACANCIES THE SAME WAY AND YOU SEE PATH. AND SO WE NOW HAVE A STANDARDIZED WAY OF DOING BUSINESS ONCE EVERYONE IS ON I AM HIGHLY CONFIDENT WE WILL BE UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE FROM. THE CAMPUSES WHO IS SENT ESSENTIALLY OUR OUR ONGOING FUNDERS THROUGH A FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL. TO REDUCE THE COST OF PATH AND TO REDUCE THE COST OF PATH IT'S GONNA REQUIRE. THAT WE FIND EFFICIENCIES IN WITH THE WAY WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES THE CAMPUS IS WILL NOT WANT TO GIVE UP QUALITY OF SERVICE. BUT THEY WILL WANT TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF THE SERVICE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELIVER WHAT WE'RE DOING. FOR LESS OR TO ACCOMMODATE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE UNIVERSITY WITHOUT GROWTH IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD OF YOU SEE PATH. AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO DRIVE THE EFFICIENCY BENEFITS OF YOU SEE PATH ONCE WE HAVE EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM. IT IS THE ANSWER HELP. SOMEONE OKAY AND AND I I I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW LATE IN THE EVENING IT HAS BECOME -- BUT AGAIN. I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE OTHER -- THINGS THAT YOU SEE BROUGHT FORWARD AND I WISH I DID -- THAT WERE COST SAVINGS -- BECAUSE THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THEM ONE AND I FORGET WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE WORK. THAT THEIR WORK IS ALREADY WORKING SMARTER AND THERE WERE THERE WERE OTHERS THERE WERE OTHERS BUT THIS ONE CERTAINLY. DIDN'T DIDN'T MAKE IT I DON'T THINK -- AND THEN YOU SAID YOU KNOW 1% OF ALL THE ALL THE THE PAYCHECKS ONE STUDENT ONE ONE ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT AND BUT THAT. PAYCHECKS. REPRESENTS WHAT NUMBER OF PAYCHECKS. BECAUSE IT'S A BIG NUMBER IT IS A BIG NUMBER AND WHAT NUMBER IS THAT SO ON AN AVERAGE SO WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY -- THAT WOULD MEAN WE'RE DOING ONE MONTHLY PAY CYCLE AND TO BI WEEKLY PAY CYCLES ROUGHLY PER MONTH. SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHECKS A MONTH. SO 11% OF 300-100-03000. THREE THOUSAND SO THAT'S HOW THAT 1% THAT'S THREE THOUSAND AND AND AND AND JUST FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THAT'S THREE THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. WHOSE PAYCHECKS WERE WRONG. FOR RICH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IF I COULD OFFER JUST A SLIGHT CORRECTION -- IT'S PAYCHECKS THE REQUIRE SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION. RIGHT SO WE RUN. I'M I'M GONNA GET THE WEEDS AND MAYBE THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE. BUT THERE'S A THREE DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WE ACTUALLY RUN A PAYROLL CALCULATION. AND THE TIME WE ACTUALLY DELIVER PAY. AND THAT THAT ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. DURING THAT THREE DAY PERIOD WE RUN REPORTS FOR THE CAMPUSES SUCH AS ZERO PAY REPORT THAT SAYS. HERE'S ALL THE EMPLOYEES THAT IT SHOULD BE GETTING PAID THAT WERE SHOWING ZERO VALUE FOR DID YOU NOT SUBMIT TIME FOR THEM. YOU KNOW WAS THERE OF A FILE THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO US THAT WOULD ALLOW US SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WAY OF RECAPTURING. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THAT NUMBER IN TIME TO DELIVER PAY ACCURATELY IN ON TIME BUT FROM THE INITIAL PAY CAL THAT'S THAT'S THE ERROR RATE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT THEN HAS TO BE MANUALLY. FIXED AND FOR WE CAN ALL I I GUESS THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT MAY BE A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S REFLECTS BUT BUT THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS. WHO ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND IF YOU'RE WITH THE ONE STUDENT WHOSE PAYCHECK? IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IT'S A BIG DEAL. TO YOU. AND AND WE'RE TALKING IT SEEMS LIKE HERE -- SEVERAL. THOUSAND STUDENTS AND I AND I APPRECIATE AND I WOULD ALSO YOU KNOW THANK YOU. AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED FOR ALL THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE. IS IT IS YOUR PRESENTED HERE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT -- GRADUATE STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND I KNOW THAT THEY APPRECIATED -- TO BUT I I AM JUST -- YOU KNOW I I AM. THE IRONY OF THIS WHOLE PROJECT AND AS MUCH AS I AM HAPPY TO HAVE IT IN RIVERSIDE -- IT IT'S JUST -- CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY pCURRENTLY HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EMPLOYEES FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY AND IT WILL GO UP TO TARGET IS. FOUR FORTY OR FORTY SO WE'RE ALMOST THERE. YEAH. BUT IT ALMOST TO ME IS IN -- AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- UNDER TAKES BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. ONE IT HASN'T BEEN. IN A WITH THE AS MUCH MONEY AS WITH ITS COST OVER. THE ESTIMATES AND WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COST SAVING. IT CERTAINLY HASN'T -- DONE WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA AND I THINK YOU YOU HIT IT DOES ADD -- INSULT TO INJURY IS THAT. LIKE MANY THESE I. T. PROJECT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PROMISED -- THE MOON AND IS NOWHERE NEAR THERE. AND THEY FEEL THEY'RE KIND OF DEALT A LITTLE BIT. AND NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT -- ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS THAT WERE PROMISED BUT SOME OF THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS. ARE GETTING PAID AND THAT'S VERY DISTURBING RIGHT AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM. PEOPLE WHO APPEAR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ACROSS THE THE STATE AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH YOUR SALARY. PRESENT PAUL THOMAS SALARY. BUDGET DIRECTOR SALARIES ARE PEOPLE HAVE A TOUGH TIME PAYING THE BILLS. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND ARE COUNTING ON THE SEATED TO DO RIGHT BY THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THE TEXAS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU SOME INFORMATIONAL ITEM [inaudible] THANK YOU -- WITH THAT WE WILL PROCEED NOW WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. A GOOD EVENING NOW A MISTER CHAIR AND HONORED MEMBERS I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING OUR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS LATE HOUR.

THIS BODY SAW FIT TO MOVE FOR WITH HER BUDGET REQUEST LAST YEAR IT DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE FINAL POINT -- IN THE BUDGET AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT SAME BUDGET REQUEST AGAIN THE STATE SHOULD FIND THE STATE PORTION OF THE UC OUR P. UP TO A MAXIMUM CAP OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS FOR A TOTAL MAXIMUM CAP OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION. THE STATE SHOULD TAKE THIS MONEY FROM THE PROP TO FIND JUST AS THEY DID THE PREVIOUS INJECTION OF FUNDS INTO THE UC RP. AND AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THE STATE FUNDS THE UC SHOULD AGREE TO WITHDRAW THEIR BARGAINING DEMAND THAT THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES OF UP THE CW A LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN AND ASKED ME LOCAL.

GOOD EVENING ERICA REMAIN ON BEHALF OF THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE WANT TO LOG THE UC FOR TAKING A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- THERE ARE NOW SIX OF THE NINE UC'S ARE HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS LIST THERE AT THE BOTTOM. OF THE GRADUATION RATES AND WHILE WE AGREE THAT PROVIDING ACCESS IS IMPORTANT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS PROVIDING THEM WITH SUCCESS THE NEED TO GET OUT THE DOOR HOLDING A DIPLOMA. AND WE NEED TO DO IN FOUR YEARS BECAUSE OUR AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME IS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND WHICH MEANS IF THEY GO OVER FOR YOUR STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. WHICH MEANS ARE TAKING OUT LOANS OR POSSIBLY NOT GRADUATING WHICH MAY HELP EXPLAIN PART OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT STUDENT SUCCESS AS WELL AS THE US THANK YOU.
