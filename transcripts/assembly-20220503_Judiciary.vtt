CHOICE BUT TO FILE A LAWSUIT.

FACT- IT WAS SO OVERWHELMED I

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:03.085
MEAN THEY CAME BACK AND LEFT

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.486
WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF AND

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:09.224
AWARD ME- AND- NOT ONLY- MY

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.526
PROMOTION BUT THEY ALSO AWARDED

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:14.696
ME SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.598
I HAD NATURAL DYE. IN THIS

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:18.333
SITUATION IN FACT THE JURY

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.003
FOREMAN HAD TOLD- TOLD A FRIEND

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.704

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.439
SHE HAD HAD HER WAY THEY WERE

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:27.109
GIVEN THE A MILLION DOLLARS IT

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:30.078
WAS THAT CLEAR CUT- IT SEEMED

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.580
LIKE THEY HAD A STATE DEMEAN

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:32.748
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD A CLEAR SENSE

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.516
OF MY EMPLOYER'S ACTIONS. AND

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.418
WHAT WAS WRONG AND AFFECT THEM.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.554
THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT SUCKS

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.723
VERY SHORT TIME TO COME TO MY

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.526
CONCLUSION- THERE'S NO-

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:47.462
UNFORTUNATELY THE CITY APPEALED-

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:50.232
MY BURKE. AND THE COURT APPEAL

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.900
STATED THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.468
THIS RECORD CONTAINS SUFFICIENT

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.003
EVIDENCE FROM WHICH THE JURY

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.072
COULD CONFIRM OR IMPORT PRICING

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:58.573
OR WAS PASSED OVER BECAUSE OF

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.042
HIS CHAIR- CHILD CARE

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:02.878
RESPONSIBILITIES. HOWEVER THERE

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.679
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.081
PASSED OVER BECAUSE HE WAS

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:07.382
SINGLE AND THE AT THE IN THE

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:11.219
BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS NO LAW

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.621
AT THAT TIME TO PROTECT. BUT

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:13.822
LOST SOMETHING NOT PUT ME FROM

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:18.260
THE- THAT I DID EXPERIENCE. BUT

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.462

REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL STILL

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:21.683
REQUIRES A BUSINESS TO

ACCOMMODATE A WORKER ANYTIME

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.519
THEY HAVE AN UNFORESEEN FAMILY

UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN

ACTUALITY THE EMPLOYER REALLY

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.160
HAS NO MEANS OF CHALLENGING

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.962
THAT. AND IF THEY TRIED THEY

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:35.763

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:51.779
CAUSE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP HOWEVER

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:52.780

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:55.149
HIGH BAR TO SATISFY. MY PERSONAL

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:57.051
EXPERIENCE IT IS THE CAUSE OF A

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.486
LOT OF LITIGATION AND IT IS

01:25:58.553 --> 01:25:59.721
SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED ON

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.556

THROUGH A SERIES OF A LOT OF

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.692
DIFFERENT FACTORS SO THERE'S

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:05.994
REALLY NO WAY FOR BUSINESS TO

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.629
KNOW. IF THEY CLAIM THAT THEY

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:08.696
REALLY DO A NEW HARDSHIP WHETHER

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.498
THAT WOULD HOLD UP IN COURT OR

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.634
WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS IS WHY OTHER

GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT THEM AS

THE LENGTH OF A STATUTE OF

DECIDED BASED ON SYMPATHY FOR

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:54.828
FIRST. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:57.531
BILL. EXEMPTS CASES THAT HAVE

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:58.498
ALREADY BEEN SETTLED OR

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:15.716

WITNESSES TO ASK THIS QUESTION

01:44:18.518 --> 01:44:20.988
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:22.856
DEFINES SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:24.658
CHANGES SUCH INDICATIONS WITH

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:26.593
REFERENCE TO THE PENAL CODE

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.161
SECTIONS THAT REFER TO LEWD ACTS

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:31.064
ON MINORS FORCIBLE RAPE. SODOMY

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:34.034
ANSWERS EITHER- AND I BELIEVE

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.403
THIS LEGISLATURE ALREADY CHANGE

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.537
THE CRIMINAL STATUTES ON

PATIENTS FOR MOST MAYBE NOT ALL

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.474
BUT MOST OF THOSE CRIMINAL

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.542
SECTIONS THAT FORM THE BASIS OF

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:43.777
THE DEFINITION FOR SEXUAL

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:46.113
ASSAULT FOR THIS BILL TO ATTEND

A TEN YEAR SESSION LIMITATIONS

01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:49.416
SO IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:51.418
BILLS ATTEMPTING TO DO CORRECTLY

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.719
IT WOULD BE ALIGNING THE CIVIL

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:55.155
STATUTE INDICATIONS WITH THE

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.089
EXISTING CRIMINAL STATUTE

01:44:56.156 --> 01:45:00.127
LIMITATIONS AM I WRONG ABOUT

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:02.429

UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL AND

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:06.099
THE BILL AND I BELIEVE IT'S GONE

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:07.801
THROUGH SEVERAL. FORMS DIFFERENT

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:08.902

GOING TO BE A SURVIVOR OF CLAIMS

01:45:29.756 --> 01:45:31.925
BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:32.859
NINETEEN LAW THAT SAID A TEN

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:35.462

SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIMS AND THAT

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:40.434
PART OF THE BILL- CROSS

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.503

CLAIMS RETROACTIVE TEN YEARS

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:57.150
GOING BACKWARD. THERE'S A

01:45:57.217 --> 01:45:59.119
SEPARATE PROVISION IN THE BILL

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:02.022
THAT- IS THE COVER A PROVISION

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:02.789
THE PROVISION FOR THIS THIS

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:04.858
OTHER REVIVER AND THAT'S A BIT

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.460
DIFFERENT IT DOES THAT PROVISION

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:07.928
OF THE BILL DOESN'T REFERENCE.

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.529
ANY OF THE CRIMINAL FELONY

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:11.798
PROVISIONS AND IT HAS THIS MUCH

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:14.968
BROADER- TACK ON OF OTHER

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:16.002

CONTACT CENTER- THERE'S NO

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:19.573
REFERENCE THERE TO THE BILL IT'S

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:21.575
MUCH BROADER AND IT GOES BACK

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:22.909
AND DEFINITELY NOT NOT TEN TEN

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:24.411
YEARS FROM THE- ESSENTIAL

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:26.379
QUESTION YEAH BUT I'VE GOT A

01:46:26.446 --> 01:46:29.015
COUPLE FOLLOW US. SO THE NATURE

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.817
OF COVER UPS IS IF THEY'RE

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:32.486
SUCCESSFUL THEIR ON DISCOVERED

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:35.789
RIGHT SO. IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:37.924
TO ME I EAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:38.658
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:40.360
DEFINITION OF COVER UP SHOULD BE

01:46:40.427 --> 01:46:42.462
AND HOW BROAD THAT SHOULD BE AND

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:43.630
HOPEFULLY WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.665
ON TRYING TO NARROW THAT SO IT'S

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:49.035
APPROPRIATE BUT- YOU. I MEAN YOU

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.771
DON'T WANT A SITUATION I THINK

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:52.272
SOCIETALLY WHERE SOMEBODY

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:54.508
SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING UP A

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:58.078
PATTERN OF SEXUAL ABUSE LIKE.

01:46:58.145 --> 01:46:58.779
THESE HORRIBLE CASES THAT CAME

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.647
WITH THE OUT OF I THINK WAS

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:01.848
PENNSYLVANIA WITH THE GYMNASTS

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:03.583

FORTH. AS ALWAYS ARE GOOD AT

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:06.753
COVERING IT UP FOR FOUR YEARS

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.789
THERE FOR SCOT FREE RIGHT SO

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.724
THAT I MEAN THAT'S MORE OF A

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:13.827
COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT THEN

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:15.095
ON THE ALIGNMENT WITH CRIMINAL.

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:17.130
I GET I AM NOT THAT. I'M NOT

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.332
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY I HEAR

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.600
YOUR GENERAL TALKING POINTS

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:21.968
ABOUT STATURE LIMITATIONS I DO

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:23.136
BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT DUE

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:24.805
PROCESS SAFEGUARDS. IMPORTANT

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:26.907
HAVE IN THE SYSTEM BUT IF WE'VE

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.141
ALREADY CHANGED IT FOR THE

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.876
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THAT'S-

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.311
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT PROOF

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:32.813
STANDARD AND SOMEBODY COULD GO

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:34.748
TO PRISON FOR LIFE FOR SOME OF

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:37.184
THE TAX. THEN WHY IS IT SO BAD

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.785
THAT WE'RE CHANGING IT TO A LINE

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:40.487
FOR THE CIVIL YEAH OUR OKAY I. I

01:47:40.554 --> 01:47:42.556
MISS BABY I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.390
QUESTION I THINK IT'S A- GOOD

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:45.091
POINT YOU'RE RAISING WE- WE LOOK

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.960
AT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY-

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:48.028
YEAH THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:49.896
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CRIMINAL

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.698
CLAIMS AND CIVIL CLAIMS AND

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:53.934
CRIMINAL CLAIMS HAVE BUILT IN

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.435
TWO AND A NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:56.469
THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE IN THE

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:58.905
CIVIL SYSTEM. MEAN ONE THAT YOU

01:47:58.972 --> 01:48:00.106
MENTIONED IS THAT THE PROOF

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:01.908
BURDEN OF PROOF IS MUCH HIGHER

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:02.976
THE PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.678
DOUBT. WORDS AND SEVERAL SYSTEM

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:05.412
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:07.013
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.448
WHICH IS A MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.617
STANDARD WHEN YOU'RE- LOOKING AT

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.552
CLAIMS GOING BACK DECADES- AND

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.254
YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW. A PERSON

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.189
WHO FEELS AND LIKELY WAS

01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:18.258
VICTIMIZED VERSUS MAYBE AN

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:19.893
ORGANIZATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.794
THEIR RECORDS ARE EMPLOYEES

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.362
AROUND ANYWHERE. YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:23.430
GONNA BE A STANDARD THAT'S NOT

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:25.432
ALL TOO DIFFICULT TO MEET WHEN A

01:48:25.498 --> 01:48:27.567
JURY HAS TO. FIGURE OUT. WHO YOU

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:29.703
GONNA BELIEVE THE PERSON WHO WAS

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:30.670
VICTIMIZED OF THE PERSONAL

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.539
EVIDENCE THERE- SO THAT'S ONE

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:34.274
DIFFERENCE OF COURSE CRIMINAL

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:36.076
JUSTICE SYSTEM ALSO HAS A GRAND

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.978
JURY. PROSECUTION PROSECUTORIAL

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:39.579
DISCRETION THEY'RE NOT GONNA

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:41.314
TYPICALLY BRING CLAIMS WHERE

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:43.049
THERE ISN'T SOME. EVIDENCE THAT

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.017
THEY'VE AMOUNTED BEFOREHAND

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.552
WHERE IS IN THE CIVIL SYSTEM.

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:46.953
YOU KNOW ANY PLAINTIFFS LAWYER

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.255
COULD FOLLOW A COMPLAINT AND

01:48:48.321 --> 01:48:49.656
THAT'LL YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:51.892
CASES LIKE THIS WILL PLACE A LOT

01:48:51.958 --> 01:48:53.693
OF PRESSURE ON THE DEFENDANT TO

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.562
SETTLE THAT CASE. ON WHETHER OR

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.564
NOT YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:58.899
EVIDENCE THAT EMERGES THAT

01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:04.271
SUPPORTS. IT OKAY. THE PROJECT.

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:06.473
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS RIGHT

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.608

OPPOSITION- YOU MAKE IT SOUND

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:21.821
LIKE THERE ARE NO CIRCUMSTANCES

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:24.524
HISTORICALLY BEFORE TWO THOUSAND

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:26.826
TWO UNDER WHICH A STATUTE OF

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.662
LIMITATIONS CAN BE TOLD- BUT

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:30.363
THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO FOR

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:36.336
EXAMPLE IN A MEDICAL. THE

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:40.006
STATURE LIMITATIONS CAN BE TOLD-

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:44.377
IF- AN INJURED PERSON CANNOT

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:46.980
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO HAVE

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:50.550
DISCOVERED THEIR INJURY- GIVEN

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:53.420

COURT CASE THAT CAME DOWN.

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:03.329
RECENTLY WE NOW KNOW THAT

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:04.631
CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.299

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.300
DESIGNING THEIR PRODUCTS TO

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:09.802
THEIR CHILDREN. IN FACT THIS IS

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.938
THEIR VERY BUSINESS MODEL- THE

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.206
REVENUE DEPENDS ON USER

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:14.707

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:21.781
MONEY. SO IT SHOULDN'T BE

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:23.650
SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE.

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:25.285
EMPLOYED NEUROSCIENTISTS TO HELP

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:27.754
DESIGN ALGORITHMS THAT CREATE

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.756
MORE MORE EXCESSIVE USE. AND

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:31.457
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:33.459
RESULTS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR

01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:34.494

SOCIAL MEDIA APP THAT'S NOT THE

01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:50.843

STRUCTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:56:42.995 --> 01:56:45.465

TO USE. YOU SHOULD AND MUST

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:51.971
DESIGN IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T

TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT- AND WHILE

THIS DEALS WITH AN INCREDIBLY

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.474
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:44.376
ISSUE- WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:46.311
DEEPLY FLAWED- AND OF TO HAVE

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:48.981
NUMEROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIAL

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:50.149
MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT ALSO FOR

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:52.451
CHILDREN ONLINE. WE TAKE THIS

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:54.153
ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY OUR

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:56.054
PLATFORMS HAVE STUDIED-

02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:58.690
ARTIFACTS ON ADOLESCENTS IN

02:09:58.757 --> 02:09:59.825
ORDER TO TRY TO LIMIT THOSE

02:09:59.892 --> 02:10:02.628
NEGATIVE IMPACTS- WE'RE ALSO

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:04.329
WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.597
SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT ADDRESS

02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:07.432
THIS ISSUE- WE THINK MORE

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.601
PRODUCTIVELY THAN THIS BILL-

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.737
FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:12.571
BILL RAISES SERIOUS

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:14.806
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS- I CAN

02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:16.341
ONLY BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:18.644
THOSE BUT TO THE- WEEK WE

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:19.411
BELIEVE IT INFRINGES ON

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:21.780
PLATFORMS EDITORIAL DISCRETION-

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.649
WHICH IS PROTECTED SPEECH- AND

02:10:23.715 --> 02:10:25.184
ALSO WOULD IMPOSE A SUBSTANTIAL

02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:26.919
CHILLING EFFECT ON LAWFUL

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:30.756
pAMENDMENT CASE LAW ON THIS TOPIC

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:32.524
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD BE-

02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:34.193
AND EXPENSIVE TAXPAYER FUNDED

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:35.394
CASE THAT ULTIMATELY THE STATE

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:38.363
OF CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE- TURNING

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.065
TO THE SUBSTANCE THOUGH. I

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:41.500
THINK- THE BILL MIS

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.802
CHARACTERIZES I THINK THE STATE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:44.803
OF THE BODY OF RESEARCH ABOUT

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:48.807
THIS BILL- NOTABLY THAT- THERE

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:51.076
IS A DIRECT CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:52.711
SOCIAL MEDIA AND DEPRESSION

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:55.013
ADOLESCENCE UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.415
TRUE THAT THERE IS A LINK

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:57.783
BETWEEN SOME POPULATION OF OUR

02:10:57.849 --> 02:10:58.750
USERS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:01.453
IMPACT- FROM USING SOCIAL MEDIA

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.721
IT IS ALSO UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE THAT

02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:04.489
THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE A

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:05.991
POSITIVE IMPACT HOWEVER THIS

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:10.262
BILLS LIABILITY- A- BURDENS. ALL

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.830
OF THAT LEGAL LIABILITY ON

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.532
SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE CAUSATION

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.467
OF THOSE HARMS- AND BECAUSE THE

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:16.735
BAR TO SHOW ADDICTION TO THIS

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:18.637
BILL SO LOW. APPOINTED SIMPLY

02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:20.539
HAS TO SHOW THAT A CHILD USE

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.373
SOCIAL SOCIAL MEDIA WAS

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.408
ADDICTED. AND SOME HARM BEFELL

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:24.576
THEM IN ORDER TO SHIFT THE

02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:25.677
BURDEN OF PROOF TO OUR

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:27.846
PLATFORMS. WE MUST THEN PROVE

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:29.147
NOT ONLY THAT WE DID NOT CAUSE

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:30.649
THE HARM- BUT THAT WE DIDN'T

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:32.818
EXACERBATED AND ANYWAY- I THINK

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.386
PROVEN THAT NEGATIVE WILL BE

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:35.354
EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ANY

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.122
DEFENDANT- THE PENALTIES IN

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:38.323
LIABILITY THIS BOAT BILL

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:40.726
IMPOSES- ARE EXCESSIVE IT WILL

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:41.893
LEAD TO FEWER SOCIAL MEDIA

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.495
PLATFORMS ONLINE SPACE FOR

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.597
ADOLESCENTS AND FULL STOP. NO

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:46.732
COMPANY CAN SHOULDER THIS LEVEL

02:11:46.798 --> 02:11:48.700
OF LEGAL RISK AND LIABILITY I

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.636
THINK I MADE A CONSERVATIVE BACK

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:51.870
THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATE. I THINK

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:54.573
ONE CLASS ACTION CASE- COULD.

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.241
SEE PENALTIES IN THE REALM OF

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:57.776
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I DON'T

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:58.910
THINK THERE'S ANY PLATFORM THAT

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.579
CAN STOMACH THAT TYPE OF

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.047
LIABILITY. I THINK- IT'S NOT

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:03.849
HYPERBOLE TO SAY SOCIAL MEDIA

02:12:03.915 --> 02:12:06.051
WON'T EXIST FOR KIDS UNDER

02:12:06.118 --> 02:12:07.352
EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:09.888
PASSES- FINALLY SHIPPED INTO THE

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:11.657
AMENDMENTS YOU KNOW I THINK

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:13.425
BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN SHIFTING

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:15.193
I'D- NEED TO REVIEW THE

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.428
AMENDMENTS IN CONTEXT- BUT- IF

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:17.929
THE BURDEN SHIFTING PROVISION IN

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.331
THE BILL. IS STILL IN THERE I

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:21.166
THINK THE PRACTICAL. PRACTICAL

02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:23.368
EFFECT MEANS THAT. OF THE

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.670
PLAINTIFFS STILL JUST HAS TO

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:28.006
SHOW- ADDICTION IN ORDER TO-

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.574
MOVE THE CASE FORWARD THEY DON'T

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:31.176
HAVE TO SHOW CAUSATION AS YOU

02:12:31.243 --> 02:12:33.178
NORMALLY WOULD AND A NEGLIGENCE

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:34.313
CASE- ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE

02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:36.648
RETROACTIVITY PIECE IS STILL- IN

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:38.550
PLACE. MEANING THAT PARENTS CAN

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.585
SUE FOR HARMS FROM WELL BEFORE

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.721
THIS THIS BILL IS ENACTED WHICH

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:45.324
I THINK NOT ONLY IS A PENS-

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.992
TRADITIONS OF FAIRNESS IN

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:48.694
AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE BUT- ALSO

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.562
CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO DELAY.

02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.004
BILLS THAT WOULD HOLD SOCIAL

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.139
MEDIA CAP COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE-

02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:02.507
WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A

02:13:02.574 --> 02:13:03.709
NARROWLY TERREL. TAILORED

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:05.410
SOLUTION TO IT WHAT BEGAN IS

THIS BOOK CONSTITUTIONAL- AND

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:03.808
THE REASON I THINK THAT IS THERE

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:05.477
HAS ALREADY BEEN A TEST CASE%

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:06.945
BROUGHT IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT ARE

02:18:07.012 --> 02:18:08.880

I'LL JUST READ THE KEY PART OF

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:19.724
THE HOLDING THE COURT ULTIMATELY

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:20.925
RULED AGAINST SNAP AND WHAT

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:22.861
HAPPENED IS THEY INSTALLED THE

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:23.461
SPEEDOMETER FEATURE IN THEIR

02:18:23.528 --> 02:18:25.263
APPLICATION. SO KIDS WERE

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:26.598
DRIVING AROUND AT HIGH RATES OF

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:28.233
SPEED AND CHALLENGING EACH OTHER

02:18:28.299 --> 02:18:29.901
IN SPEED CONTEST USING THE

SPEEDOMETER THING AND SOME SOME

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:34.239
KIDS TRAGICALLY DIED. THE

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:36.274
PARENTS BROUGHT A LAWSUIT- SNAP

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:39.144
ARGUED THAT TWO THING- MAINLY

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:42.213
THAT SECTION TWO THIRTY- WHICH

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.516
PROVIDES FEDERAL PREEMPTION FOR.

02:18:44.582 --> 02:18:45.583
PROTECTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:48.153
SITES THAT- SO THEY CAN'T BE

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:49.354
SUED FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT THE

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:51.389
GETS POSTED. THE COURT FOUND

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:52.791
SECTION TWO THIRTY DIDN'T APPLY

02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:54.926
HERE- AND THE RULING SAID IN

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.461
SHORT SNAP WAS SUED FOR THE

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:57.595
PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES OF

02:18:57.662 --> 02:18:58.997
DESIGNING SNAPCHAT IN SUCH A

02:18:59.064 --> 02:19:01.066
WAY. THAT IT ALLEGEDLY

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.667
ENCOURAGED DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR.

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:04.102
ORDAINING ACCORDINGLY THE PANEL

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.403
CONCLUDES THAT SNAP DID NOT

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.439
ENJOY IMMUNITY FROM THE SUIT

02:19:07.505 --> 02:19:08.807
UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY. AS TO

02:19:08.873 --> 02:19:10.141
THE OTHER POTENTIAL COST TO

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:11.443
CHECK THE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.976
CHALLENGE UNDER THE FIRST

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:13.745
AMENDMENT. OUT WE'RE NOT

02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:15.613
REGULATING CONTENT AT ALL.

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.315
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

02:19:17.382 --> 02:19:20.385
THAT SAYS THE- X. Y. Z. SOCIAL

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:22.353

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.122
ALLOW THIS TO BE POSTED OR MUST

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.057
ALLOW THAT TO BE POSTED IT. IT

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:28.126
SIMPLY BUILDS ON THE EXISTING

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:29.661
NEGLIGENCE FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS

02:19:29.728 --> 02:19:31.696
IN CALIFORNIA LAW HAS FOR

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:33.531
HUNDRED A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS.

02:19:33.598 --> 02:19:35.066
THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T BE NEGLIGENT

02:19:35.133 --> 02:19:37.102
IN THE PRODUCT DESIGN IN THE

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:38.970
FUTURE YOU IN BED IN THE PRODUCT

02:19:40.772 --> 02:19:42.540
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE

02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:45.276
IS. PROVEN HARM SO I

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:47.479
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE-

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.180
WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THIS IS

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:50.415
AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL BILL OR

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:52.650
SOME. TEST CASE FOR THAT'S GONNA

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:54.419
GET STRUCK OUT DOWN BY THE

02:19:54.486 --> 02:19:55.820

TELLING SOMEBODY THEY CAN OR

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:00.725
CAN'T SPEAKER WITH THE CANDOR

02:20:00.792 --> 02:20:02.060
CAN'T SAY THE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:20:02.127 --> 02:20:03.328
ISN'T A PROBLEM AND THIS BILL

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:05.330
DOESN'T DO THOSE THINGS. AND WE

02:20:05.396 --> 02:20:07.432
ALREADY HAVE A NIGHT CIRCUIT

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:10.368
FEDERAL CASE- THAT THIS BILL IS

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:11.603
MODELED AFTER- WHERE WE ARE. ON

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:13.505
SOLID GROUND SAYING. FEDERAL

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:14.906
SECTION TWO THIRTY DOES NOT

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.741
PREEMPT. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:20.278
TRY TO DO. THANK YOU FOR ME WHEN

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:21.112
ONE OTHER QUESTION- THE

02:20:21.179 --> 02:20:22.881
OPPOSITION IF THIS BILL PASSES

02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:24.315
THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN COULD

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:26.117
BE THAT POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA'S

02:20:26.184 --> 02:20:28.386
TO BE KICKED UP THE PLATFORM-

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:30.522
CAN YOU ADDRESS THIS AGAIN IS

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:33.091
THAT IT THE BILL. THE BILL JUST

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:35.026
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHO

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:37.829
CAN BE LED ON OR NOT BE LED ON A

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:38.429
PLATFORM I MEAN THEY CAN STILL

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:40.331
ALLOW MINORS TO USE OUR PLATFORM

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:42.233
UNDER THIS BILL IT JUST SAYS YOU

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:43.868
IF THE BILL BECOMES LAW YOU'VE

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.336
GOT THREE MONTHS TO DISABLE

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:47.572
ADDICTIVE FEATURES- THAT BECAUSE

02:20:47.639 --> 02:20:49.707
KIDS ARE. AT ABBOTT AND THAT

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.476
GOES TO YOU KNOW GO AHEAD

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:53.111
ADDRESS THE SAFE HARBOR

02:20:53.178 --> 02:20:54.646
RETROACTIVITY PIECE TO BECAUSE

02:20:54.712 --> 02:20:57.348
YOUR QUESTION OF TOUCHES ON THAT

02:20:57.415 --> 02:20:59.918
AS WELL- THE GENERAL NEGLIGENCE

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.719
STATUTE IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:04.222
YEARS SO ANY RETROACTIVITY THAT

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:05.957
WOULD APPLY UNDER THE BILL IS

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:10.061
LIMITED TO GOING TWO YEARS BACK

02:21:10.128 --> 02:21:11.396
ONE. TWO THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:13.364
TYPES OF SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:14.699
AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL-

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:15.533
THEY'VE GOT THREE MONTHS FROM

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.268
DATE OF ENACTMENT AND ANY NEW

02:21:17.335 --> 02:21:18.469
THING COMES UP THAT THEY

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:20.104
SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERS THE

02:21:20.171 --> 02:21:22.307
DESIGN SOME SUPER COOL SCROLL

02:21:22.373 --> 02:21:24.409
FEATURES ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:26.744
AND IT HAS LIKE A SLOT MACHINE

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:27.245
TYPE EFFECT THAT WASN'T

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:30.415
ANTICIPATED ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT

02:21:30.481 --> 02:21:31.883
THAT THAT IS CAUSING ADDICTIVE

02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:33.751
BEHAVIOR AND HARM BOTH PRONGS

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:36.487
MUST BE MET THEN THEY HAVE

02:21:36.554 --> 02:21:37.722
THIRTY DAYS TO DISABLE THE

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:38.957
FEATURE AND AVOID ANY LIABILITY

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:40.391
AT ALL. SO I THINK THE

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:42.260
RETROACTIVITY TO THE EXTENT

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:44.162
EXISTS ONLY GOES BACK TWO YEARS-

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:46.130
WE'VE GOT A WELL DOCUMENTED

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:48.266
RECORD FROM THE FACEBOOK WAS

02:21:48.333 --> 02:21:49.834
BLOOD TEST MONEY THAT. BECAUSE

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:50.702
SOME OF THE STUFF WAS DONE

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:53.771
KNOWINGLY OF TO SLEEP THAT AT

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:54.639
THAT AND THEY'VE GOT A SAFE

02:21:54.706 --> 02:21:56.307
HARBOR- ON THE ADDICTION

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.409
DEFINITION PIECE IF I CAN TOUCH

02:21:58.476 --> 02:21:59.811
ON THAT BRIEFLY BECAUSE IT WAS

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:00.678
RAISED AND WE'RE TAKING THE

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:01.846
DEFINITION OF ADDICTION ISSUES

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:04.549
AND MEDICINE AND MEDICAL SCIENCE

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.850
MINUTES PATTERNED AFTER THE

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:08.186
DEFINITION IN THE- PSYCHIATRIC

02:22:08.253 --> 02:22:12.123
MANUAL THE DSM- IT I THINK IT'S

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.757
A GOOD DEFINITION. F THERE WERE

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:14.459
PERFECT DEFINITION I WOULD USE A

02:22:14.525 --> 02:22:19.297
PERFECT DEFINITION BUT. I THINK

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:21.032
THIS IS CLOSE TO PERFECT AS WE

DEEPLY FLAWED. AND WE MAKE THEM

02:24:55.119 --> 02:24:57.355
BETTER BECAUSE IN THE END WE

FOR THE RECORD MORE GENERALLY.

02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:44.415
IS TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:46.684
AND TO PUT BEING SURE THAT WE

AREA THAT REALLY HAS NOT BEEN.

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:04.035
THOROUGHLY LITIGATED AND THERE

02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:05.970
IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONTENTS

02:29:06.037 --> 02:29:07.505
AND ALGORITHMS IN THE OPPOSITION

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:09.106
KEEPS TALKING ABOUT CONTENT AND

THE CONTENT ITSELF IN THIS BILL

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:19.817
I DON'T SEE IS AS- REGULATING

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:22.019
THE CONTENT BUT THE MECHANISMS

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:23.921
THE ALGORITHMS IN THE FEATURES

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:27.124
BEHIND THAT. THAT ARE SERVING UP

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:30.227
THE AIR AND TAKING DATA AND

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:31.662
INFORMATION FROM THE USERS AND

UP WHAT THEN THAT INDIVIDUAL IS

02:29:36.867 --> 02:29:39.704
SEEING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:40.905
YOUTH AND INDIVIDUALS IS A

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:42.306
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:43.674
SUBJECT HERE MEAN IT CAN BE. AND

02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:46.377

UP IN. THAT IN THE MEDIA AT AND

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.948

THIS BILLS REALLY GOING AFTER IS

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:53.684
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:55.586
PLATFORMS AND THAT IS. THE

02:29:55.653 --> 02:29:57.321
INTENTIONAL TARGETING AND THE

02:29:57.388 --> 02:29:59.156
INTENTIONAL CREATION OF

02:29:59.223 --> 02:30:03.160

02:30:03.227 --> 02:30:04.729

DRUGS AND THAT'S WHAT MOST

02:30:12.603 --> 02:30:13.571
PEOPLE THINK OF CERTAINLY

02:30:13.637 --> 02:30:16.240
GAMBLING AND OTHERS BUT THESE

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:17.942
PLATFORMS ARE INCREDIBLY

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:19.543
ADDICTIVE AND INCREDIBLY

02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:23.147
POWERFUL AND UNFORTUNATELY. IN

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:26.250
OUR SOCIETY THE WAY WE TEACH

02:30:26.317 --> 02:30:29.653
BOYS AND GIRLS AND IT. IS

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:33.891
FEEDING INTO A LOT OF THE

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:35.960
ANXIETIES THAT THAT THERE.

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:37.928
EXPERIENCING WHEN THEY GET ONTO

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:39.663
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT WHEN

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:42.099
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE DOING

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:43.934
THE RESEARCH IN ORDER TO FIGURE

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:45.870
OUT HOW TO KEEP KIDS ADDICTED

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:49.673
AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:52.476
THAT PLATFORMS BUSINESS MODEL IS

02:30:52.543 --> 02:30:55.179
SUCCESSFUL BY TYING PEOPLE TO

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:56.547
THEM IN WAYS THAT THEY CAN'T

02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:57.882
SEPARATE FROM AND ESPECIALLY

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.650
WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS THAT IS

02:30:59.717 --> 02:31:01.519
VERY MUCH ALARMING. AND THE TECH

02:31:01.585 --> 02:31:03.087
INDUSTRY HAS ALL OFTEN COME TO

02:31:03.154 --> 02:31:04.989
THIS LEGISLATURE SAYING NO WE'RE

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:06.991
DIFFERENCE NO WE'RE SPECIAL

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:08.759
DON'T REGULATORS DON'T TOUCH US

02:31:08.826 --> 02:31:11.328
BECAUSE WE'RE INNOVATIVE AND

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:13.631
WE'D WHATEVER APPROPRIATE BUZZ

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:15.433
WORDS THAT THEY WANT TO THROW

02:31:15.499 --> 02:31:17.368
OUT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:18.602
IS. THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT

02:31:18.669 --> 02:31:19.970
ALTERNATELY THAN ANY OTHER

02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:21.439
INDUSTRY AND THE COURTS IN THE

02:31:21.505 --> 02:31:23.974
LARGE STARTING TO COME TO THAT

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:25.376
CONCLUSION WHETHER IT'S AN

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:27.711
ONLINE MARKETPLACE OR FUNCTIONS

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:29.914
THAT THAT DRIVE INTENTIONALLY

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:32.616
DRIVE ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR FOR THE

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:34.819
PURPOSE THEN OF THE VIABILITY OF

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:36.053
THAT PLATFORM THAT IS

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.888
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE VERY

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:40.658
CAUTIOUS OF FOR US TO WEIGH IN

02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:41.725
AND TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE IN

02:31:41.792 --> 02:31:43.794
THIS CUNNINGHAM UNITE THAT THESE

02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:45.296
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. THE ROLE

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.031
THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF

02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:49.033
GOVERNMENT IN LEVELING PLAYING

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:52.269
FIELD AND IN LOOKING OUT FOR THE

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:54.872
WHOLE BASIS FOR CONSUMER

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:56.574
PROTECTION LAWS ARE. LOOKING OUT

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:57.808
FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ENSURING

02:31:57.875 --> 02:31:59.810
THAT THAT THINGS ARE SAFE. SO

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:01.312
THERE ARE QUESTIONS RAISED AND

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:03.514
THINK THE ANALYSIS. REALLY TALKS

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.282
ABOUT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:06.617
DEFINITIONAL LEE WERE STEPPING

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:08.586
INTO AREAS THAT THAT STILL NEED

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:10.254
TO NEED TO BE SORTED OUT WE

02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:11.989
CAN'T SORT THOSE OUT WITHOUT

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.958
PUTTING A BILL LIKE THIS FORWARD

02:32:14.024 --> 02:32:14.825
. HAVING THE DEBATE IN THE

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:17.428
LEGISLATURE AND ENSURING THAT WE

02:32:17.495 --> 02:32:20.197
ARE. BEING AS RESPONSIVE AS WE

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:23.400
CAN TO. CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:25.736
ALLOW THOSE TO MOVE FORWARD BY

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:27.071
BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES

02:32:27.137 --> 02:32:29.440
ABOUT THE DANGERS THAT ARE. OUT

02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:31.542
THERE AND ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS

02:32:31.609 --> 02:32:34.078
AND IT'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:35.412
BEEN THE WILD WEST FOR A LONG

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:37.414
TIME IT'S NOT THE WILD WEST

02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:38.749
ANYMORE IT NEEDS A LITTLE

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:40.584
APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. AND TO BE

02:32:40.651 --> 02:32:42.486
A LITTLE BIT MORE CIVILIZED AND

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:44.622
JUST SAY TO COME TO LEGISLATURE

02:32:44.688 --> 02:32:45.756
THEY DON'T TOUCH US BECAUSE

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.291
WE'RE SPECIAL DOES NOT HOLD

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:49.727

IT'S A PRODUCT DESIGNED BILL

02:34:58.522 --> 02:34:59.990
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS.

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:01.625
AND IT'S PROTECTING KIDS IN THIS

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.661

I DID I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO

02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:46.603
DISABLE IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T

02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:48.605
DESIGN THE FEATURE IN THE FIRST

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:50.174
PLACE AND AGAIN I'M NOT A

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:50.841
SOFTWARE ENGINEER SO THAT REALLY

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:53.043
THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:55.979
ARGUMENT HAS COME UP BEFORE WILL

AND THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. TO

02:36:14.631 --> 02:36:15.933
DESIGN ALGORITHMS AND THEY'RE

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:17.701
THE ONES THAT THIS BILL WOULD

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:19.636
PUT THE ONUS ON. TO DISABLE

02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:22.072

A WAY THAT THEY ARE. BENEFICIAL

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:25.843
TO CHILDREN. AND NOT.

02:36:25.909 --> 02:36:27.678
POTENTIALLY OR ACTUALLY IN FACT

02:36:27.745 --> 02:36:29.980
HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. AND UNLESS

ISN'T TAKING ACTION ON THIS.

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:35.085
THERE'S BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:38.055
THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

02:36:38.122 --> 02:36:39.189
BUT GUESS WHAT'S COME OUT OF

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:40.023

CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY HERE

02:36:42.025 --> 02:36:44.228
I MEAN WE CAN AND- THEY ARE NOT

02:36:44.294 --> 02:36:45.829
GONNA KICK KIDS OFF THE PLATFORM

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.564
I DON'T BUY IT FOR A SECOND. I

02:36:47.631 --> 02:36:49.299

IF THIS BECOMES LAW. IT'S FIX

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:55.806
THE FEATURES THAT ARE CAUSING

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:57.875
HARM THROUGH ADDICTION TO KIDS

02:36:57.941 --> 02:36:59.276
AND THEY CAN DO IT THEY HAVE THE

WORLD'S SMARTEST ENGINEERS

02:37:00.811 --> 02:37:02.846
WORKING FOR THEM MAKING TONS OF

MONEY. TWO GENERATIONS AGO THESE

02:37:04.214 --> 02:37:04.948
ENGINEERS WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:06.283
PUTTING MAN ON THE MOON. AND
