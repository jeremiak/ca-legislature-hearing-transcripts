GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT S. B. THREE TWO THREE WHICH WOULD CREATE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE SETTINGS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL AND START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. WATER AND SEWER UTILITY BUDGETS ARE FUNDED AS YOU KNOW BY REVENUE COLLECTED THROUGH SERVICE RATES THESE RATES PROVIDE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPLY SAFE DRINKING WATER UPGRADE AND IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATE EFFECTIVELY EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LAWSUITS THAT SEEK REFUNDS OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE EXISTING RATE STRUCTURES YEARS AFTER RE TO BEEN ADOPTED IN COLLECTED. THESE DELAYED LAWSUITS CAN THREATEN AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT GUARANTEED BY REVENUE FROM THE RATES DERAIL ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND GENERALLY UNDERMINE AGENCIES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABLE BUDGETS NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. LATELY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES FILED AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES RATE STRUCTURE STRUCTURES FOR SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT- HAVE BEEN SUED THE ED THE CHALLENGE RATES WERE ADOPTED FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THE LAWSUIT AND NOW WITH AN ADDITIONAL STRAIN OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITING WATER SHUT OFFS REGARDLESS OF A CUSTOMER'S ABILITY TO PAY. WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE UNDER CONSTANT FINANCIAL STRAIN AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE AT RISK THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND. IN THIS BOOK ELECTRIC RATES CHECK RATES OR CHARGE. SB THREE TWENTY THREE ADDS CONSISTENCY TO EXISTING LAW BY AUTHORIZING A LOCAL AGENCY OR INTERESTED PERSON TO BRING A VALIDATION ACTION IN SPIRIT COURT. TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF A FEAT FOR A CHARTER CHARGE FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE VALIDATION ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. PARTIES WOULD BE BETTER BARRED FROM CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE FEAR THE CHARGE. BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO BRING CHALLENGES WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BALANCE THE INTEREST OF THE RATE PAYERS WITH THOSE OF THE PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES. AND THE CURRENT PRACTICE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHRIS ANDERSON WITH AQUA. AND PAUL COOK WHO IS A GENERAL MANNER MANAGER OF IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TO SUPPORT LIST WITNESSES LISTED CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON.

FIRST JUST WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER THE KIND THEY DEVOTED TO WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR CABALLERO AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK AS WELL STE. SB THREE TWO THREE PASSED THE SENATE LAST MONTH AND MOST RECENTLY ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- IN PART BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES NOT PRESENT A NEW REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. ALIGNS WITH LONGSTANDING PRECEDENT EXISTING LAW HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS STATURE LIMITATIONS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR ME ALEXX BREAKS XP'S ACTUALLY CHARGES. ANOTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES AND CHARGES THE LEGISLATURE CREATED STATURE LIMITATIONS FROM IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY WE'VE- RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO REDUCE FISCAL UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. SB THREE TWO THREE SIX TO PROVIDE SIMILAR PROTECTIONS TO WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. AND SIMPLY CLOSE THIS GAP IN EXISTING LAW. AND NEVER TO ADDRESS OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. CENTER MENTIONED WE'RE TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO INFORM CUSTOMERS OF THIS NEW LEGAL PROTECTION PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL MAINTAINED DISCONTENT CUSTOMER PROTECTION ALREADY AFFORDED AND PROPOSITION TO ANYTHING. OF NOTE THAT WHILE MANY OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVEN CHARGES HAVE THE PROTECTION OF A HUNDRED TWENTY DAY SCHEDULE IMITATIONS NONE ARE SUBJECT PROP TO EIGHTEEN. AND NONE REQUIRE AGENCIES TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE STATUE LIMITATIONS CUSTOMERS. THIS MEANS THAT THIS THAT THERE WILL BE AN UNMATCHED LEVEL TRANSPARENCY AROUND WATER AND SEWER RATES. IF SB THREE TWO THREE BECOMES LAW. SIMPLY PUT STILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF REPAIRS ON PUBLIC EIGHTY PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES TO AVOID UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY. THREE CENTS REQUEST PRIVATE.

THAT IS WHY I TO THEM IN AGENCIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BRING ITS OWN VALIDATION ACTION WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PROTECTION. AND GIVE TAXPAYERS PROPER NOTICE SHOULD ACTION BE NECESSARY THE AGENCY WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS COST PROHIBITIVE. BUT IS FAR MORE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER TO BRING SUCH AN ACTION AND EVEN MORE SO FOR TAX. FOR RATEPAYERS TO PAY POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL P. INSULATED FROM CHALLENGES BY THE ABSENCE OF ANY REVIEW BY A COURT. WHY THE CANCER CASE AGAINST EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE WATER DISTRICT BEING USED TO JUSTIFY THIS BILL.

SENATE BILL THREE NINETY TWO WILL IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS AND REDUCE DELIVERY COSTS BY REQUIRING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TO COMMUNICATE WITH HOMEOWNERS VIA EMAIL UNLESS OF RESIDENT CHOOSES TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATION VIA ANOTHER METHOD. SUCH AS TRADITIONAL MALE CALIFORNIA COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL BYLAWS AND UNDER THE STATE'S DAVIS STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT. UNDER THE DAVIS STARTING ACT ASSOCIATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MEMBERS WITH NECESSARY DOCUMENTS INCLUDING ANNUAL BUDGETS POLICY STATEMENTS OR NOTICES VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL UNLESS ELECTRONIC DELIVERY IS OTHERWISE REQUESTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL. PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT SOUGHT TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION MEMBERS FROM EXORBITANT FEES RELATED TO DOCUMENT DELIVERY BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF ASSOCIATIONS CAN CHARGE FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSING PREPARING AND DELIVERING THESE DOCUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY TO FURTHER INCREASE INFORMATION ACCESSIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE TO THREE AND TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH REQUIRED HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO DELIVER MEMBERSHIP BOARD ELECTION RULES BY INDIVIDUAL DELIVERY OR BY POSTING ON A WEBSITE. IN A POST COLD AT NINETEEN WORLD INTERNET WEBSITE AND EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND VITAL IN KEEPING THE PUBLIC INFORMED AND IN TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEFAULT DOCUMENT DELIVERY METHOD IS TRADITIONAL MAIL. SB THREE NINETY TWO MANDATES HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO ELECTRONICALLY DELIVER NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS TO ITS MEMBERS BEGINNING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE IF A RESIDENT POPS IN TO RECEIVE EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS IT FOR RESIDENT CHOOSES NOT TO OPT IN THE ASSOCIATION WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER THEIR DOCUMENTS BY MAIL. THIS BILL IS PIVOTAL. TO ENSURING THE DOCUMENT DELIVERIES AT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE KEPT UP AND KEPT UP TO DATE WITH IN OUR EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF INFORMATION SHARING AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

EXISTING LAW REQUIRES PROPERTY OWNERS TO ANNUALLY PROVIDE. AN H. AWAY UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO HOMEOWNERS VIA EMAIL EVEN IF THAT IS THE HOMEOWNERS PREFERRED DELIVERY METHOD. SB THREE NINETY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BY PERMITTING PROPERTY OWNERS TO FIND EMAIL AS ONE OF THEIR TO PREFERRED COMMUNICATION METHODS WELCOME TELLING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH HOMEOWNERS VIA EMAIL. IF THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. UNDER THE MEASURE PER OWNERS CHOOSE PROVIDING EMAIL TO THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BUT MAY ALSO REVOKE THEIR CONSENT TO RECEIVING COMMUNICATION. BY EMAIL AT ANY TIME. WHICH OF THE GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC PANDEMIC WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR PHYSICAL MAIL DELIVERY SYSTEM. EMAIL DELIVERY MUST BE AN OPTION DRIVEN BY HOMEOWNERS NOT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS PREFERENCE.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS MARKET VERY YES GO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HI GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MARJORIE MURRAY FROM THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE NINE TWO- THIS BILL. TRIES TO LAY OUT LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE METHODS. FOR A HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION TO DELIVER DOCUMENTS TO WITH. SO THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL. THE BILL IDENTIFIES ONE METHOD OF DELIVERY WHICH IS EMAIL HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT METHOD THE FRAME BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS GOVERNING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AMENDING THE BILL TO DATE SO THAT IT AT LEAST REQUIRED BASIC KIND OF PLANTS BY THE HOMEOWNER. THE FOUR DOCUMENTS CAN BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY HOWEVER ONE STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS HAVE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. GOVERNING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION WHICH ARE NOT. AND WHICH WILL SEND WHICH STILL CONCERNED THAT. THE FIRST OF THESE IS DISCLOSURE AS WE KNOW FROM GETTING HANDLED. FROM OUR BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE TO GET A NOTICE ANNUALLY ON HOW OUR EMAIL ADDRESS IS GOING TO BE USED BY THE PERSON OR ENTITY IN POSSESSION OF IT. IN THE CASE OF THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW TO WHAT THIRD PARTY THE ASSOCIATION MIGHT DISSEMINATE. OUR PERSONAL PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT IS OUR EMAIL ADDRESS. AS I SAID THERE'S NOTHING FAKE AND FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THAT THERE BE AN ANNUAL PRIVACY NOTICE DISSEMINATED BY ANY BUSINESS ENTITY THAT COLLECT THIS INFORMATION AND SB THREE NINE TWO SO FAR HAVE NOT DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE. OUR CORE IN OPPOSITION WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA FOR RETIRED AMERICANS BECAUSE THE FACTUALLY CONCERNED. THAT THE EMAIL ADDRESSES OF SENIORS BE PROTECTED BECAUSE EMAIL ADDRESS. AS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY ALL KINDS OF RESEARCH ON SENIOR FRAUD. SENIORS EMAIL ADDRESS IS A SURE ROUTE TO DESCRIBING SENIORS OF IDENTITY PROTECTION AND SO ON. AND FINALLY SB THREE NINE TWO DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE OTHER LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRE CERTAIN KINDS OF DELIVERY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF DOCUMENTS SPECIFICALLY FOR ILLEGAL DOCUMENTS. AFTER ALREADY IF THE REQUIREMENT THAT LEGAL NOTICES LIKE I NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT BLAME HE SAID IN A PERFECT METHOD AND THAT METHOD IS NOT EMAIL DELIVER. IT HAD TO BE BY CERTIFIED MAIL SO ANY LEGAL DOT. THE WITH A STEP COLOR FOR COAL NOTE- NOTICE OF AND ON NO ARE ALREADY LAID OUT INSTEAD. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT THREE NINE TWO OF TO. THAT NO LEGAL DOCUMENTS HAVE THEIR OWN. AND STATUTORILY REQUIRED MODES OF DELIVERY- UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE CAN GET THE BILL FURTHER AMENDED THREE AND A CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED AMERICANS REMAIN IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SB THREE THREE TO ESTABLISH AS A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD TO PROTECT PRESCRIBED FIRE BURN BOSSES FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS RESULTING FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF A PRESCRIBED FIRE LET ME BEGIN BY OFFERING THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR HELP AND FINE TUNING OF THE LANGUAGE THE GORGING MORE USE OF THE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT CURRENTLY OCCURS THIS STATE IS THE GOAL OF SB THREE THREE TWO. PRESCRIBED FIRES TYPICALLY DONE OR SUPERVISED BY A BIRD BOSS WHO IS QUALIFIED TO PLAN ORGANIZE AND EXECUTE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS PRESCRIBED OR CONTROLLED BURNS. DESCRIBE BURNING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COST EFFECTIVE TOOLS USED TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. WITH CALIFORNIA HAVING SUFFERED MORE THAN A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WILDFIRE LOSSES OVER THE LAST DECADE. IT IS PARAMOUNT THAT WE EMPLOY EVERY EFFECTIVE TOOL TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY INTENSITY IN THE SCALE OF FUTURE WILDFIRES. EXPERTS TELL US THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TREATING A MINIMUM OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF WILDLAND WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE EACH YEAR. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO TREAT A FRACTION OF THAT WHAT OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA WHICH IS A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD THREE AS MUCH AS TWO MILLION ACRES ANNUALLY. ONE MIGHT ASK WHY IS CALIFORNIA LIKE WELL ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONCERNS WERE PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS IS THAT THEY WILL BE BILLED OF CAL FIRE OTHER AGENCIES PROVIDE SUPPRESSION SUPPORT ON A BURKE. THE CONCERNS OVER HIGH FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS ENCOURAGES THE PRACTITIONER AND LANDOWNER TO AVOID USING PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THIS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO GETTING MORE LAND TREATED. SB THREE THREE TWO WOULD SPECIFY THE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED BURKE BOSSES- PERSONS THEY SUPERISE PROPERTY OWNERS TO HIRE BIRD BOSSES AND DATE OF AMERICAN CULTURAL BURNERS ARE SHIELDED FROM FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS UNLESS THEY CONDUCT A BURN IN A GROSSLY NEGLIGENT MANNER. A BIRD BOSS WOULD STILL BE LIABLE FOR SUPPRESSION COSTS AT THE ACTED RECKLESSLY BUT IF THE BIRD BOSSES CONDUCTED WORK FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT USING THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INC CONSISTENT WITH A BURN PERMIT THEY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THESE RARE. BUT COSTLY SUPPRESSION CUT EXPENSES SB THREE THREE TWO HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THE TIMBER INDUSTRY PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS FIRE AGENCIES AND MORE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I HAVE.

PRESCRIBED FIRE PROVIDES LARGE AND GROWING BENEFIT CITY CALIFORNIA GET THE LIABILITY REGIME WE HAVE TREATED PRIMARILY AS AN ACTIVITY WITH PRIVATE BENEFITS. THIS BILL TAKE A MODEST STEP TOWARDS CHANGING BY ALLOWING FOR BURNS THEIR PLAN BY CERTIFIED BROWN BOSSES AND RECEIVE ALL REQUIRED PERMITS TO BENEFIT FROM CAL FIRE SUPPRESSION. UNLESS THEY ARE CONDUCTING A RECKLESS MANNER. IT'S IMPORTANT EMPHASIZED THE BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS TO PREVENT TO BROAD APPLICATION OF THIS LIABILITY REALLY. I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO SET FIRE TO A PILOT BRUSH IN MY BACKYARD CLEAN RELIEF UNDER THIS LEGISLATION ONLY BURNS PLAN BY EXPERTS AND CONDUCTED BY EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE PERMITS REQUIRED TO CARRY. IN A LOCAL AIR DISTRICT COVERED UNDER THIS RELAXATION SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY WHICH DISTRICTS AND APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN SOCIETAL GOOD BEING PROVIDED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS OFTEN FOR LITTLE PAY OR ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS. AND A MODEST RISKS TO THE PUBLIC POST. SORRY PUBLIC BUDGET BOTH BY CAL FIRE RESPONDING TO AND LENDING ASSISTANCE ON A PRESCRIBED FIRE THIS KEEPS CONTAINMENT. ASSEMBLY THE BILL WOULD SOCIALIZE THE COSTS OF FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES CALLED TO THE SCENE OF A PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT MEETS THE STRICT CRITERIA LAID OUT NEW LANGUAGE I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT.

SO WE SEE THAT ONLY THE MOST PASSIONATE AND COMMITTED AMONG AFTER LEADING THESE EFFORTS BECAUSE WE RISK EVERYTHING IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THAT'S REALLY NOT THE WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENABLE MORE OF THIS WORK THAT WE ALL RELY ON IN THE PROVIDE SO MUCH PUBLIC BENEFIT. WE ROLL OUT THIS NEW STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS PROGRAM AND ALLOCATE MORE STATE FUNDS FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE EFFORT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL LIABILITY CONCERNS IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM THE BILL ADDRESS CIVIL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES FROM PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT IN ITS REVISED CURRENT FORM AND TALK OF COST RECOVERY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION THESE ARE TWO OF THE MOST CRITICAL FACETS OF LIABILITY FOR PRACTITIONERS LIKE ME AND I WISH WE COULD ADDRESS BOTH I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WILL BE HUGELY IMPACTFUL.

THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU RIGHT OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB SIXTY TWO SENATORS ARE ALSO. MY NAME IS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SB SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID WAGES TO THE SKILLED WORKERS WHO MAKE THOSE GARMENTS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERS OF CONTRACTING THAT COMPANY MAY USE. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS THE ORIGINAL GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT WAS PASSED THERE ARE TWO UNDERLYING CAUSES OF WAGE THEFT TODAY. THE CAUSE CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY FALL BEHIND AND IS BECAUSE WORKERS TO RELY ON THE GARMENT RESTITUTION FUND FOR THEIR WAGES WHICH LEAVES TAXPAYERS TO SUBSIDIZE WAGE THEFT. RIGHT NOW THE FUND HAS A BALANCE OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS TRANSFERRED INTO THAT FUND TO PAY FOR WAGE THEFT FIRST FASHION BRANDS CREATE POVERTY WAGES THROUGH UNREALISTIC PRICING OF GARMENT ORDERS. AND YET THEY HAVE NO LEGAL LIABILITY SECOND. THE ARCHAIC SYSTEM OF PAIN BY PIECE RATE THAT IS THAT KEEPS MINIMUM WAGE ALWAYS OUT OF THE REACH FOR WORKERS. YOUR COULD THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED FOR EUROPEAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN ALL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I'M PROUD TO RECOGNIZE. THAT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FASHION INDUSTRY BUSINESSES MOSTLY WOMEN LED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LEADING THE CHARGE FOR ETHICAL WORKPLACE AND SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. THEY ENDORSE THIS BILL TO PROTECT HIGHLY SKILLED GARMENT WORKERS FROM LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE MADE THE INDUSTRY HOSTILE TO ETHICAL GARMENT COMPANIES. TRUMP WHO ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE SWEATSHOPS. THESE BUSINESSES ARE TRYING HARD TO ENSURE THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE MADE IN THE USA REPRESENTS QUALITY AND WORK STANDARDS ALL COMPANIES SHOULD WANT TO PROTECT THEIR IMAGE BRANDS HAVE THE POWER TO END. THIS PROBLEM AND FIX THEIR INDUSTRY THIS IS NOT ABOUT A FEW BAD ACTORS ESCAPING LIABILITY. THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR UNCOVERED WAGE VIOLATIONS THAT 85% OF SEVENTY SEVEN LOS ANGELES GARMENT SHOPS DURING RANDOMLY- MADE INSPECTIONS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AT THE SAME TIME SOME BRANDS HAVE REALIZED THE ADVANTAGE OF A STRONG DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN REDUCING RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY SHIPPING OVERSIGHT. WHICH WERE ALL EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN DISRUPTIONS TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THIS PANDEMIC HAVE MOTIVATED COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOPIN LOS ANGELES FOR THE BENEFIT OF SKILLED LABOR. 65% OF RETAILERS DECIDED THE ANSWER THE ANSWER TO THOSE RISK WAS TO ESTABLISH DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING. AS THE LARGEST INDUSTRY OF ITS KIND IN THE US THE APPAREL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN L. A. COUNTY PRODUCES FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ANNUAL OUTPUT. OUR GARMENT WORKERS ARE TRULY THE ENGINE THE KEEPS OF FASHION INDUSTRY MOVING WE'VE HEARD FROM THESE WOMEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO MADE THE COUNTRY'S MASKS FOR AS LITTLE AS TWO CENTS APIECE WORKING SIXTY AND SIXTY HOURS A WEEK DURING COVERT. SB SIXTY TWO IS THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY. WILL HELP REGAIN MILLIONS A WEEK AND WAGES STOLEN FROM WORKING WOMEN THEIR FAMILIES AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY TODAY WE HAVE TO EXPERTS- MISTER CHAIRMAN TO EXPERTS ON THE WITNESS LINE. NUMBER WORKER IS SOMEBODY CASTRO. AND BUSINESS OWNER KRISTIN FUND ARRAKIS FOUNDER AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR FOR SINCE THE TEMPLE THEY WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT AND WE HAVE ON THE LINE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS MONEY AVAILABLE SHARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. RIGHT WE I DO HAVE THOSE WITNESSES WITNESSES LISTED KRISTIN FREDERICK IS AND ISABEL CASTRO WHO HAS A TRANSLATOR WITH HER SO WE'LL START WITH KRISTEN FEDERAL OFFICE. HI THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHARACTER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN CENTER I CAN'T THE FOUNDER AND DESIGNER OF THE TENSILE A CLASSICALLY INSPIRED LUXURY LINE MADE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. I'M ONE OF THE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE AND GROWING FASHION INDUSTRY BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I SPENT OVER A DECADE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING N WALL STREET AND THEN LATER AND FINANCIAL POLICY IN WASHINGTON DC AN AREA WHERE I REMAIN ACTIVE SENSING NOW ON ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES. I LOST MY BUSINESS TO ADDRESS WHAT I FALL WITH A LACK OF QUALITY CLOTHING AND WHAT I DISCOVERED IS INDUSTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT DEPEND ON LOW PRICES AND VOLUME AND WHEN THE LARGE COMPANIES MAKE THEIR CLOTHING IN CALIFORNIA THEY DEPEND ON PAYING BY THE MINIMUM WAGE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS FOR SHAREHOLDERS. WAGE THEFT IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT IS BUILT INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL OF LARGE FASHION CORPORATION. IT'S NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT ALLOWING IT TO CONTINUE TO TRADE CONSUMER CONSUMER TRUST IN THE MADE IN CALIFORNIA LABOR LATE LABEL. AND IT FEELS FROM CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. PASSING SB SIXTY TWO YOU WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON A BUSINESS THAT IS ALREADY FOLLOWING THE LAW BY PAYING A MINIMUM WAGE. AND ASSIGNING JOINT LIABILITY WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON A COMPANY THAT HAS DONE THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ON THEIR FACTORY SOMETHING THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES. ARE CLAIMING THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE. COMPANIES TRY TO BREAK THE LAW THAT BACK AND THEN THE WAGE AND ORDERED OFFER. ARTIFICIALLY LOW PRICED CAR YOU CAN HER COMPANY LIKE AND AGAINST THE- WHO BELIEVE IN. OF THE MANY DIFFERENT IF. AS WELL AS THE ACT. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE MEETING HELD LATE HAS ECONOMIC VALUE OTHERWISE THE COMPANY IS WHAT BE TRYING TO CONVERT THE LAW. AND OR THEY WOULD HAVE A MOVE THEIR BUSINESSES- OVERSEAS. ALLOWING THIS BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE HURT COMPANY IF YOU BELIEVE IT AND ALL THAT COULD BE MADE IN CALIFORNIA LABEL MEANS. AND WHAT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TO THRIVE. AT THE LARGEST APPAREL MANUFACTURING HUB IN THE U. S. FOR THE STATE TO TRULY BE THE PROGRESSIVE LEADER AND CLAIMS TO BE ON ON FIFTEEN ABILITY.

WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WE ARE THE ONLY CERTIFIED ORGANIC AND- SOCIALLY COMPLIANCE T. EIGHT THOUSAND MANUFACTURE IN IN- NORTH AMERICA. IN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY THIRTY YEARS IN BUSINESS MADE USA ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING TO BRANDS AND CONSUMERS. THE LAST LAST YEAR'S GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CHAIN DISRUPTION CREATE A POSITIVE SHIFT TO DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING ESPECIALLY HERE IN LOS ANGELES. SINCE JANUARY THERE'S BEEN A STARTING OR EXPANDING THEIR DOMESTIC APPAREL PRODUCTION BY PEERS AND I HAVE ISSUES WITH THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THAT THESE BRANDS IN THEIR RETAIL PARTNERS WILL BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN. APPEARS IN CUSTOMERS MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THIS WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION COSTS THE MISTAKE MAKE BOTH THE ALREADY PAYS THIRTY TO FORTY DOMESTIC NAY CLOTHING BRANDS ALREADY PAID COMPARED TO THEIR CHINA OR INDIA. MAKE COUNTERPARTS. AS BRENDA ENTERTAINING SHIFTING THE DOMESTIC PER FROM CHINA TO THE U. S. ANY DECLINE IN ALREADY LOW MARGIN WILL HURT OR STOP THE CHANCE TO BE THE CONTINUED MADE USA WE SHORING APTRIX. THERE IS A MUCH EASIER SOLUTION ONE SIX TO WHAT YOU WANT CONCENTRATE YOUR CURRENT OUTWARDS ON THE CONTRACTORS TO MAKE THE CLOTHING FOR THE NATION'S TOP THREE. RETAIL DISCOUNTERS ANNUAL FINDER INDUSTRY VIOLATORS. THERE IS NO NEED TO PENALIZE THE WHOLE INDUSTRY FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW. IN A TIME OF HOPE THE LAST THING THE INDUSTRY NEEDS IS MORE UNLESS YOU'RE VERY COSTLY LAWS OR REGULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. RIGHT ACTUALLY OFTEN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION SB SIXTY TWO IS A JOB KILLER ON THE START BY SAYING THAT WE IN THE MANUFACTURERS AND BRANDS THAT DO JUSTICE HEALTH FOR NOW SHARE THE SAME GOAL IF SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL TO ELIMINATE THE ENTITIES THAT ARE CIRCUMVENTING THE LAW AND ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE LAWFULLY PAID BUT I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS TODAY. FIRST THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL SAY THAT THE EXPANSION OF JOINT LIABILITY IS NECESSARY BECAUSE BRANDS LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE- OTHER FAST FASHION BRANDS THAT PAY LOW PRICES FOR GARMENTS CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THE LAW THAT IS NOT TRUE UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT TEN THAT LAW SAYS THAT ANY ENTITY THAT ENTERS INTO A CONTRACT FOR GARMENT MANUFACTURING WHO KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW THAT THE PRICE IS INSUFFICIENT TO PAY WORKERS OR TREAT THEM LAWFULLY IS. IS THERE A LIABLE UNDER THE LAW FOR WAGES PENALTIES IN ATTORNEY'S FEES SECOND I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD OVER THE PAST YEAR WITH MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY WHO ARE AT THE TABLE FOR DISCUSSIONS ON EIGHTY SIX THIRTY THREE THEY SUPPORTED AB SIX THIRTY THREE AND THEY STILL DO THEY AGREE THAT BRANDS WHO DO NOT PAY ENOUGH MONEY FOR CLOTHING SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE WAY THAT THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS BUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT ON SIXTY TWO ON THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE CLOTHING HERE. THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM AN LA BASED BRAND IT WAS A SUPPORTER OF SIX THIRTY THREE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS ON SIX THIRTY THREE WHO'S UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY HE SAYS THE BIGGEST ISSUE I SEE WITH THIS BILL IS A REQUIREMENT THE RETAILERS TO GET PURCHASE ORDERS TO MANUFACTURERS PEOPLE LIKE ME NOT SO IN CONTRACTORS WE HIGHLY LIABLE FOR WAGES NOT PAID BY THE SEWING CONTRACTOR THAT I CHOOSE I ACCEPT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY SEWING CONTRACTORS ACTIONS I ALREADY AM UNDER SIX THIRTY THREE. BUT OF A COMPANY NOW BECOMES LIABLE BY GIVING ME A PURCHASE ORDER THEY JUST WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH ME ON ANY GOODS I MAKING CALIFORNIA SINCE I MAKE 65% OF MY GOODS IN CALIFORNIA I CANNOT JUST MOVE ALL OF THAT OFF SHORE BUT IT WILL MEAN THAT I HAVE TO GO FROM A PREDOMINANTLY DOMESTIC CLOTHING MAKER TO ALL IMPORTS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL NO PUBLIC COMPANIES GOING TO TAKE ON THAT BURDEN THEY SIMPLY WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH A COMPANY THAT MAKES IN CALIFORNIA IF THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE MANUFACTURERS AND STEAKS. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT. FROM HOW FASHION OF THE WORKS THERE AND EAT CONVERSE RETAILER WHO CONTRA. OUT FOR THE PRODUCT THEY HAVE ON THE- AND THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE BILL GOES THROUGH INTRIGUED ALL RETAILERS LIKE FASHION OVER I WILL LOSE MY MAJOR BUSINESS AND THEY WILL NOT TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY NOR SHOULD THEY- MAJOR STORES WILL NOT BY MEETING CALIFORNIA GOODS AT THEIR- IF THEY HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE THEY JUST DO NOT NEED US FIRST THAT LIABILITY RISK. SO WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INSTEAD FOCUS ON TARGET REPORTS MINT. POLICING OF THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS THAT MANY OF THESE PROBLEMATIC ENTITIES AVOID- RESTRUCTURING OF THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS. AND ELIMINATION OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT FAIL TO PAY THEIR WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO SB SIXTY TWO.

THEY ARE A FAMILY THAT COMMUNITIES OUR STATE AND WE NEED TO CREATE A POSITIVE INCLUSIVE INTEGRATION EXPERIENCE AND WHY IS THAT YEARS BECAUSE AN OFFICE WILL HELP SHINE A LIGHT ON THE LANDSCAPE OF IMMIGRANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE KNOW WHO ARE THE DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AN OFFICE ACCORDING TO STATE SERVICES NOT TAKE AWAY SERVICES FROM DEPARTMENTS BUT MAKE SURE THE DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT- THIS COULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL MOST RECENTLY TO CLEANING EFFORTS TO RESTRICT THE CO THERE. BUT ALSO OVER THE YEARS AND LIKELY IN THE FUTURE AND RESPONSE TO NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE FIRES AND FLOODS- AN OFFICE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO CREATE THEIR OWN OFFICES SO I THINK THAT'S PRACTICES. AND MOST OF ALL WE IN THE OFFICE BECAUSE WE ARE AN IMMIGRANT STATE MORE THAN 25% OF FOREIGN BORN ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR KIDS HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS MINE INCLUDED. OUR UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION ARE EXTREMELY LONG PEDDLED A GREAT MAJORITY ABOUT TEN YEARS AND OF THOSE LIKE 25% OF THE HUMAN IN TWENTY YEARS- NEVER AGAIN NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN NYC STATUS FAMILY ABOUT 20% OF ALL PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND GOOD MORNING- CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES- I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL FOUR FOUR SEVEN WHICH EXTENDS OF VICTIMS RIGHTS TO THE RIGHT OF THEIR LOVED ONES TO PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN SUFFERING- EVEN AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY DIE PRIOR TO A CASE RESOLUTIONS- CALIFORNIA IS JUST ONE OF FIVE STATES- THAT ALLOWS VICTIM RIGHTS FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING REDRESSED TO DIE WITH THE VICTIM- SO THIS IS- AN ISSUE OF JUSTICE IN. ANY TIME BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY EXACERBATED BY THE COVERT PANDEMIC. AND ALL TOO OFTEN DEFENDANTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING LAW OF PROLONGING COURT PROCEEDINGS IN HOPES THOSE DELAYS WILL OUTLIVE THE VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE- THIS IS WRONG AND THEY SHOULD BE NOT REWARDED WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH. TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT EVEN WITH THOSE WHO WERE GRANTED A PREFERENCE TRIAL- I HAVE BEEN WORKING ARE WITH OPPONENTS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDMENTS. ONE SET OF OPPOSING AMENDMENTS WANT TO THE BILL NARROWED TO ONLY APPLY TO CASES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WAS GRANTED PREFERENCE. FOR THEIR CASE AND THE TRIAL WAS DELAYED DUE TO COVERED. A NINETEEN HOWEVER- ONE OF THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT THAT AMENDMENT WOULD CAPTURE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR PREFERENCE WERE FILED A MOTION FOR PREFERENCE. BUT DID NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO ATTAIN IT SINCE THE COURTS WERE CLOSED DUE TO COVERED. I CONCERNS HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPRESSED AT THIS BILL CREATES A DOUBLE DIP. BUT AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS ACTION BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE DECEDENT. VERSUS A WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF A SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON WHOSE DEATH WAS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANOTHER. THEIR NON THE LESS ACTION THAT SEEKS VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF- DAMAGES IN FOR INFLICTED ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I AM ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH OPPOSITION HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND COMMON GROUND UNTIL THEN ARE THE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN REFLECTS THE FACT THAT VICTIM SHOULD NOT SUFFER DUE TO THE SYSTEM FOR WHATEVER REASON. THE SYSTEM THAT CANNOT ADJUDICATE THEIR CRIMES PRIOR TO DEATH. VICTIMS AND THEIR LOVED ONES DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND JUSTICE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT VIA THE TELEPHONE LINE. IS LAUREL HOW BERNIE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. ANTENA SCHWEIKERT ABOUT A SPECIFIC CASE I THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU I HAVE. THREE NAMES LISTED LAURA HOW MANY. AS A PRIMARY WITNESS CRISTINA SWEAR OCCURRED AS A PRIMARY WITNESS AND THEN ALSO POTENTIALLY MARK BRAT WHO IS ON STANDBY SO WILL TAKE TO WITNESSES. OR A HOBBY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAUREL HALL BENEATH AND A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS CO SPONSORING THE BILL ALONG WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND ASKING YOU TO PASS SB FOUR FORTY SEVEN AND ELIMINATE THE DEATH DISCOUNT FOR HUMAN SUFFERING DAMAGES. EXAMPLES OF HUMAN SUFFERING DAMAGES ARE DESTRUCTION OF THE ABILITY TO WALK SEVERE AND DISFIGURING BURNS MAYBE IT IS BEST JUST CANCERS THAT SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY CRUSHES THE INTERNAL ORGANS OF THE VICTIM. SENATOR LAYERED NOTED WE ARE ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES THAT WHITE THAT THESE DAMAGES OF THE VICTIM DOES NOT PUT SIMPLY UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A PERSON OR COMPANIES BAD PONDERED BECAUSE OF INJURY. THEY GET A WINDFALL IF THEIR INJURIES KILL THEIR VICTIMS. THE DEATH DISCOUNT FALL HARDEST ON PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE LOST INCOME SUCH AS ELDERS AND STAY AT HOME PARENTS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR DAMAGES ARE AT THE HUMAN SUFFERING THAT THEY HAVE RESULTS FROM THEIR INJURIES. AND AS SENATOR LETTER ALSO NOTED THERE IS A STRONG FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE LAWYER TO REPRESENT THOSE BAD ACTORS TO DELAY AND OBSTRUCT COURT CASES IN THE HOPES THAT THE VICTIM WILL DIE BEFORE TRIAL. AND THAT THE DAMAGES WILL DIE WITH THEM. SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN DOES NOT CHANGE DAMAGES CAPS IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE RULES OF EVIDENCE. IT'S SIMPLY ALLOW HUMAN SUFFERING DAMAGES TO BE TREATED LIKE OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES WHEN AN INJURED PERSON DOLLARS. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THEN CRISTINA SWECKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTINA SCORECARD I WAS MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND GEORGE WHITE PARTS OF FORTY EIGHT YEARS.

AND THEN ALICIA WAGON WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ON THE PHONE. MIKE BELOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM LIKE BELOW SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL. YOU KNOW I HAVE THE HIGHEST PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL REGARD FOR SENATOR LAYERED AND WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WHICH IDEA WAS PRODUCTIVE. WAS ALSO GREAT NALYSIS LAYING OUT THE POLICY ISSUES. WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BOTH THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF THE BILL. THE PRESENT BILL APPLY TO ESSENTIALLY EVERY TORT CLAIM WHERE THE PLAINTIFF DIES PRIOR TO JUDGMENT EVEN IF THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING TORT. AND THE DEATH OF PLANO. YOU COULD HAVE A WRONGFUL TERMINATION CLAIM FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN FOLLOWED BY A CAR ACCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN THE PLAINTIFFS DEATH. OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WAS ATTEMPTING TO DELAY ANYTHING HOPING THAT THE PLAINTIFF DIED IT WAS A RANDOM EVENT. BUT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SKULL. AT THIS POINT WITH THE- THE SO CALLED SUNSET CLAUSES OF BASED ON A CRUISE ACTIONS BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY SIX IT WILL APPLY TO EVERY EXISTING CLAIM. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOSE OF APPROVED BY NOW WILL ALSO APPLY TO EVERYTHING THAT ARISES DURING THE FOUR YEAR PERIOD. PLUS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS APPLE COUPLED WITH THAT UNDERLYING TORT. WAS THE TIME TO GET TO STYLE SO IT'S NOT A FOUR YEAR. PERIOD IT'S A VERY LONG PERIOD COULD BE TEN TWELVE FOURTEEN YEARS. EFFECTIVE THIS WILL DRIVE UP- DAMAGE AWARDS DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS WELL RESPECTED PUBLIC CLAIMS FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY BUT THE SIZE OF THE AWARDS HAS GROWN GREATLY. PRIMARILY IN THE NON ECONOMIC AREA THIS IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THE LAW AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO SENATOR LAYERED. BUT. AT THIS POINT WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. I YOU. THEN ONLY SHOW WHITEMAN THE PHONE PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR JERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S ALICIA WAGNER ON AND I AM THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND I AM ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF TWENTY SIX HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FACILITY IN KERRY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED. AT A TIME OF PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES CARRYING FOR KOBE NINETEEN PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO NEED ACCESS TO VITAL SERVICES. THIS BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN WOULD PLACE YET ANOTHER FINANCIAL BURDEN ON PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND HEALTH FACILITIES ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. THE BILL WILL RESULT IN A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN DAMAGE OF ON CALIFORNIA AND A LOT AND I'VE NORTE UNDERLYING RATIONALE UPON WHICH DAMAGE AWARDS ARE BASED. AND WHILE THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE MICRO STATUTES EXPRESSLY THE AFFECTED WILL HAVE A MEDICAL CASES THAT THE POTENTIAL. POTENTIALLY DOUBLING AWARD AMOUNTS TO CLEAN UP. WHICH CARDS PROVIDER LIABILITY INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE. CREATING AN IMPACT ON OUR MEMBERS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CARE TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S PATIENTS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WILL GIVE RISE TO INCREASE THE COST TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS MORE LITIGATION CLOGGING OUR COURTS SYSTEM. AND UPENDING THE LONGSTANDING POLICY IN CALIFORNIA THAT PORT DAMAGES ARE INTENDED TO COMPENSATE THE PERSON WHO SUFFERED THE INJURIES DIRECTLY. CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO FAIRLY ESTABLISH EVIDENCE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING WOULD BE THROUGH TESTIMONY OF THE INJURED PERSON AFTER PERSON DOES THAT EVIDENCE OF WHAT AMOUNT TO HEARSAY TESTIMONY WHICH IS SECONDHAND INFORMATION. THAT COULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIATED. UNDER A LONGSTANDING LONG CALIFORNIA PLAINTIFFS AND THEIR HEIRS HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS AND AVENUES TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR LOSSES IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THE PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST. OF PRESERVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHILE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION TO THOSE WHO WERE INJURED. EXISTING LAW IN CALIFORNIA ALSO PROVIDES FOR TRIAL PREFERENCE FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT EXPECTED TO SURVIVE. THROUGH TRIAL AND LITIGATION. THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY RECOGNIZING THE BACKLOG THAT COATED NINETEEN HAS CREATED IN THE COURT SYSTEM. AS OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY ACTION FILED IN IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF REQUEST TRIAL PREFERENCE. AND THE CONSIDERATION OF THAT REQUEST WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. TO ALLOW THE SURVIVORS TO RECOVER INTERCEPT THE LEGAL RATE ON ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED CALCULATED FROM THE TIME OF FILING THE REQUEST THE TRIAL PREFERENCE. IF IT PROCEEDS ALL AGES THE ISSUE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HANNAH PROVIDE THE PLAINTIFFS FAMILY WITH ADDITIONAL RELIEF AND AWARDS AND AT THE SAME TIME KEEPS THE PAIN AND SUFFERING AND NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES PRESIDENT INTACT FOR PURPOSES OF THESE LAWSUITS. WITHOUT AMENDMENTS THAT LIMIT THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS BILL. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WILL BE A LOT MORE TO EXPANSION OF DAMAGES FOR INJURIES GOT TO FIX THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED NOT IN KERR. AS WELL AS ANOTHER VAGUE SUBJECTIVE AN UNLIMITED SOURCE FOR LARGER WORKING TENEMENTS PERSONAL. INJURY CASES IN CALIFORNIA. ENABLING PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS WHO TYPICALLY OF COURSE OF THE SETTLEMENT TO COLLECT MORE FEES. THE RESULTING SETTLEMENTS IN PERSONAL INJURY CASES WILL BE BORNE BY CONSUMERS HAVING TO PAY HIGHER PRICES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AND RISK PATIENT SOUTH AFRICA CARE. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS OUR COALITION OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FACILITIES IN CARRIERS MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN AT THIS TIME AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO DECADE OPPOSITION DOES BEFORE. FORTY SEVEN. SEEING NONE THE REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE.

GOOD MORNING ZACHARY CORBEAU WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION LIKE TO ALIGN OUR POSITION WITH SEJAK IN CMA WE ARE ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES THEN FOR US BEFORE FOR SEVEN I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS KALRA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SURE AND THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD I THINK- THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS COMMONLY OKAY IT'S A COMMON TRIAL PRACTICE- FOR- SILVA DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TO PLAY THE LONG GAME PLAY OUT FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE. OF- THE ROLE OF WAITING IT WAITING OUT SOMEONE THAT IS TERMINAL- AND- IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A MORAL ASPECT OF WHAT WE SEE SOMETIMES MAY NOT BE ILLEGAL BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT- THEY REALLY CALLS INTO QUESTION- OUR SYSTEM WELL IN THAT KIND OF PRACTICES CONTINUE TO ALLOW TO HAPPEN WITHOUT- TRUE COMPENSATION- FOR THE PAIN AND SUFFERING. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FOR YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AN EASY PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO BRING FORWARD TO- GETTING KNOW GIVEN- YOU KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION MAY FACE BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY THE LEAST ATTEMPTS TO FIND JUSTICE. FOR THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE OF VICTIMS I THINK IT DOES GO A LONG WAY IN THAT REGARD AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SUCH GREAT CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED INSURANCE RATES. I HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE- I'D MISS REYES I WASN'T SURE THAT MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU DID BRING AND I THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS AS A PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY. WAS HAVING PLAINTIFF DIED AND THEN TELLING THE FAMILY THAT. BASICALLY THE CLAIM FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEIR CLAIM TO VALUE THE CLAIM DIED WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU PUT A- A SUNSET ON IT I THINK SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE TO- TRY THIS OUT FOR A WHILE HI. THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONLY ONE OF FIVE STATES. THAT DO NOT ALLOW THAT IS A GREAT CONCERN SOMETHING THAT. FOR MANY YEARS NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED I APPRECIAE YOUR WORK ON IT AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THIS IS. GOOD LEGISLATION POSSIBLE NOBODY'S GOING TO BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WE ALL KNOW THAT BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE. INTRODUCED THIS AND ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT. I THINK IS. A WONDERFUL THING FOR MANY OF THOSE. AS I SAID WHO WILL LOSE THEIR LIFE DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE CLAIM. I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE MOVE TO GET THE BILL THANK YOU WE DO AS A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER AND THE MISTAKES- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE GOOD INTENTIONS BEHIND THIS BILL SENATOR- AND HOW KNOWING YOU AS I DO- I KNOW THAT- YOU'RE TRYING TO. ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT THE TO EITHER SOMEONE ELSE BROUGHT HERE THAT YOU'RE SEEN IN THE SYSTEM- I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS LEGAL. DISTINCTION WHERE. YOU KNOW IF A PERSON PASSES AWAY THE PROPER CLAIM IS. A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM. THE PAIN AND SUFFERING BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW FOR THE VICTIM IT IS IT IS STILL LIVING IT'S NOT THAT THERE AREN'T REMEDIES BECAUSE THERE ACTUALLY ARE- IN WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS THERE'S INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES- AND MANY OTHER DIFFERENT REMEDIES THAT. DO RESULT IN COMPENSATION. FOR THE AGREED FAMILY THAT'S LOST- THE FAMILY MEMBER- IN TERMS OF ABUSES IN ANOTHER UNETHICAL PRACTICES WE SEE THEM ON ALL SIDES OF. THE LITIGATION SYSTEM AND WE ALSO HAVE TOOLS ALREADY IN OUR- LEGAL SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH EITHER FRIVOLOUS MOTIONS OR DELAY TACTICS- WE HAVE THOSE IN OUR CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE TO PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE DOING UNETHICAL THINGS TO KEEP PEOPLE. FROM DELAYED FROM DELAYING JUSTICE- SO. YOU KNOW I CAN'T SEE A REAL STRONG REASON FOR CHANGING THAT LEGAL DISTINCTION WHICH AGAIN STILL GIVES EITHER THE AGGRIEVED PARTY THE VICTIM WHO- IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH PAIN AND SUFFERING THE CHANCE TO PROVE THEIR DAMAGES- IN COURT OR IF YOU HAVE A PLAN OF WHO HAS PASSED AWAY FOR THE FAMILY STILL TO PROCEED WITH. A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION AND GET- COVERAGE- THE COUPLE QUESTIONS I JUST HAVE FOR YOU IS- THIS TO ME THIS WHERE TO GO FOR HOW DOES ONE PROVE DAMAGES- OF PAIN AND SUFFERING IF THE IF THE PERSON HAS NOW PASSED AWAY- WHO HOW IS EVIDENCE GOING TO BE INTRODUCED. TO PROVE THAT PAIN AND SUFFERING AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE- YEAH THE ABILITY TO CHECK THE ACCURACY OR TO CROSS EXAMINE- THAT EVIDENCE N THE COURT OF LAW AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WHAT ROW AS A PRACTICAL MATTER YOU'VE GOT TO A HEART OF THE CONUNDRUM. WHICH IS THAT. ARE THERE IS A DELAY IN HEARING THE PEOPLE THAT COULD PREVENT THE EVIDENCE ARE NOT ABLE PRESENTED ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IT. AND THEN IT MOVES IT INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT DELAY. AND THE REAL GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE THAT SO THAT IN FACT YOU CAN HAVE THE EVIDENCE AS BEST YOU CAN IN PERSON WITHOUT HAVING TO SHIFT. TO THE NEXT STEP OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD USE WHATEVER MEANS YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE THE EVIDENCE AND GET TO THE FACTS. TO READ THEM TO YOU CAN RUN INTO ISSUES LIKE HERE SAVE FOR INSTANCE- AND. YEAH I GUESS IF YOU'RE HAVING MAYBE A DOCTOR. TESTIFY AS TO WHAT THEY YOU KNOW HAD SEEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE ABILITY TO. AND AGAIN LIKE THERE ISN'T A REMEDY TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE AGAIN NOW THE CASE IF SOMEONE PASSES AWAY AND THAT IT FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DOES HAPPEN. TRADITIONALLY THAT BECOMES A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM. AND NOW THE FAMILY IS BRINGING THE CLAIM AND THERE AND INCLUDED IN THAT IS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE LOST AS A RESULT- BUT THE PAIN AND SUFFERING IS REAL AND IT IS DISTINCT AND WHAT HAPPENED IS. I MEAN IN NINETEEN WHATEVER THE YEAR WAS- SIXTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE SET THIS UP AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW A COMMISSION ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED THREE DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING THIS IN THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE. TO LEAVE THIS OUT AND IT'S THE REASON THAT WERE ONE OF JUST FIVE STATES- THAT DOES IT THIS WAY IT IN THE FOR THE ANALYSIS RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- THIS IS ABOUT ON UNDERLYING IN JUST A CERTAIN UNDERLYING THING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR ABOUT COVERED AND IT IS ACTUALLY ABOUT BOTH BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL. IT WAS MAGNIFIED BY COVE IT IT WAS IN EVIDENCE BY THE FACT THAT THE COURT SHUT DOWN. THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT APPLY EVEN IN A TIMELY WAY FOR PREFERENCES THE PREFERENCES WERE LIMITED IN CERTAIN WAYS WHETHER IT WAS AGE SEVENTY OVER OTHER THINGS AND IF SOMEBODY HAD A PAIN AND SUFFERING ISSUE- THEY WERE NOT AFFORDED THE ABILITY TO FULLY HAVE REDRESS. IT IN THE TIME OF OUR FORTUNES HAVE. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW MANY CASES WERE DELAYED DURING THE CODE EMERGENCY AND DIDN'T GET A PREFERENTIAL- TRIAL DATE OR HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THEIR TRIAL- I CAN SEE IF THERE IS DATA FROM THE COURTS THERE IS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I MEAN WE HAD SOMEBODY TESTIFY. ONE PERSON JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THAT IN FACT HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ACCUMULATED IN A DATA. AMANDA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT BUT WE'LL CHECK WE'LL SEE IF ANYTHING EXISTS WILL PROVIDE WELL I THINK I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE SITTING HERE TRYING TO MAKE POLICY THAT WE THINK IS. THE BEST WAY BETTER TO HAVE LIKE THE- YOU KNOW THE- THE NUMBERS WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HAPPENED. WE KNOW FOR A FACT IT HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT THE WITNESS TESTIFIED TO WE CAN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE. OF HOW IT HAPPENED BUT WE KNOW IN FACT IT HAPPENED RIGHT BUT WE'VE KNOWN FOR. YEARS THAT THIS HAPPENS IT WE DO HAVE PLAINTIFF TO PASS AWAY DURING THE PENDENCY OF LITIGATION. AND WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT IS WHAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A PANDEMIC IN WHICH THE COURTS ESSENTIALLY IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SHUT DOWN. OR DELAYED IN SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL MORE AND THAT'S MY POINT IS IF THIS IS A CODE THAT ISSUE THEN WE SHOULD HAVE SOME DATA. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO HAVE SOME DATE ON HOW HOW MANY CASES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OR IS THIS. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE CASES WHERE THIS DOES OCCUR- WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO CSS- AND THEN I MEAN THE INSURANCE WANTED INSURANCE ISSUE IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S MINDS IT INCLUDES. AT THE PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ARE TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. YOUR DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT. THE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS MIGHT BE SEEN IF THIS WAS NOW. CHANGE IN THIS WAY AND TERMS HOW'S THAT GOING TO AFFECT. NO COVERAGE NO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THERE. HAVE BEEN ACTUARIAL SORE THINGS RUN BASED ON ON WHAT IT IS BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR THAT I WAS GONNA DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES THAT CAME UP IS THAT THIS DOES NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER MICRO THE CAP EXISTS TO CAP IS NOT ALTERED. AND SO TO READ ANYTHING INTO THAT IN REGARD TO INSURANCE RATE IS NOT CORRECT. OKAY WELL I'VE I APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS AND AGAIN I KNOW THIS IS COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE AND WELL INTENTIONED AND- CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SITUATIONS. WHERE THIS HAPPENS I GUESS JUST WHERE I FALL AS I THINK WE CURRENT HAVE CURRENT REMEDIES TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION. I DON'T THINK IT IS TRUE THAT YOU LOSE YOUR ENTIRE CLAIM YOU ACTUALLY JUST NOW HAVE A DIFFERENT CLAIM IN OR NOT REPRESENTING YOU LOSE YOUR ENTIRE CLIENT MORE REPRESENTING THAT YOU LOSE THE PEACE THAT IS PAIN AND SUFFERING. RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL THOSE ARE AND FOR ABUSES IT WHICH I CERTAINLY. I THINK WE ALL OF WAR IF THERE ARE ABUSES WE ALSO HAVE REMEDIES. YOU KNOW FOR THAT IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AND I JUST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE DATA ON. THOSE TWO ITEMS- BUT- THANK YOU CENTER I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISS DAVIS. THANK YOU SENATOR AB REALLY JUST KIND OF THEM TO- FROM MY COLLEAGUE MY CONCERNS ARE JUST HAVING DATA AND KNOWING YOU KNOW HOW MANY CASES- YOU KNOW WHERE FAILED DURING CULTIVATED I THINK WAS MARCH TWENTY TWENTY A NOT TO BE HEARD OR RESOLVED BEFORE THEN JUST TO SEE IF I WAS LATE THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW IS IT FIVE IS A FIVE HUNDRED I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION LIKE THIS I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CASES WERE DENIED DURING THAT TIME. AND THEN AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO BECAUSE- WHEN IT COMES TO COST ESPECIALLY WITH INSURANCE MY CONCERN IS IT USUALLY ENDS UP GOING DOWN TO THE CUSTOMER ONE WHERE THE OTHER STARTS HERE AND THEN THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO AND IS YOU KNOW THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE A COST EFFECTIVE SO I THINK JUST DATA WOULD BE- WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TO MY STAFF AND MY OFFICE. A. N. I THINK JUST TO REPEAT TO AND MAYBE EVEN EXPAND IN SOME CASES THIS DATA WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IF SOMEBODY WAS NOT ALLOWED TO FILE FOR PREFERENCE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY'RE NOT IN THE SYSTEM FOR NOT HAVING FILED PREFERENCE IT'S LIKE WE COULD SEE IF PEOPLE COULD COME FORWARD AND SAY I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT BUT- BUT IT IT WOULDN'T EXIST IN A STANDARD WAY OF COURT STATISTICS TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM. HAVING SAID THAT WE WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I AGREE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT TO CONFLATE IS YOU APPROPRIATELY STATED THIS IS A CODE ISSUE THE APPLE FIBER CODE BUT THERE IS AN UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT EXIST REGARDLESS. AND SOME OF THE SPECULATION ON INSURANCE RATES IS JUST THAT IT'S SPECULATIVE AND IN A NOTE REALLY WHAT THAT IMPACT WAS GOING TO BE BUT BECAUSE THESE ARE UNDERLYING EXISTING. LIABILITIES THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE CALCULATION REALLY HOW LONG IT WOULD BE. AND FOR THOSE ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO PARTICIPATED HEARINGS THAT WE HAD JOINTLY WITH THE SENATE. EARLIER IN THIS YEAR YOU KNOW THAT THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING FROM THE COURTS HAS BEEN. A BIT SPARSE AND TRYING TO COLLECT EXACTLY THESE KINDS OF DATA IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR TO UNDERSTAND IMPACT SOUGHT. THE TWO LADIES AND- WHAT HAPPENED WITHIN THE COURT SYSTEM AND ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES. THE COUNTER DIFFERENT IMPACTS AND THERE THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF CROSS CALIFORNIA BUT THAT SHOULD NOT DISTRACT US FROM THE NEED. TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING POLICY OF WHETHER OR NOT. THESE KINDS OF REMEDIES DIE WITH THE PLAINTIFFS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT AND I THINK THIS IS VERY APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION AT THIS POINT AND A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OF POLICY. FOR THE BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN. GRIEVOUSLY INJURED OR- IN THIS CASE DIED BECAUSE OF INJURIES SUSTAINED. OKAY SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE YOUR COMMENTS THAT THE- FUNDAMENTALLY HAS TO CLOSE IT JUST SAID PRITCHARD EVERYBODY ELSE'S COMMENTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IT'S AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS I SAT IN THIS ROOM WITH YOU IN THE JOINT HEARING OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ON THE BACKLOG IN THE COURTS AND LOTS OF THE THINGS YOU SAID WERE THE EVIDENCE OF THAT HERE SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. DO MOST THE SECOND MOTION TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NOTE CHAU. TWO FIVE TWO BY DAVIES. DAVEY SNOW GONZALEZ RIGHT GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES. RAYSIDE. THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU SENATOR. GREAT SENATOR MITCHELL WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER NINE SB. THREE NINETY ONE. THANK YOU TEARS DOWN THANK YOU TWO NUMBERS COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. SB THREE NINETY ONE IS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE NARROWLY TAILORED THAT AUTHORIZED IS- COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT BOARDS INCLUDING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO SAFELY MEET VIA TELECONFERENCE DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS AND ENSURES THAT FAIR PARTICIPATION IN THESE MEETINGS IS ACCESSIBLE MEMBERS. IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING PANDEMIC THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN IO LAST YEAR ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AGENCIES TO MEET AND VOTE REMOTELY. YET NO SIMILAR ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR HOAS LEAVING THEM WITH NO GUIDANCE OR PROCEDURES DURING THIS UNUSUAL TIME. THE DAVIS STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT REQUIRES HOAS TO PROVIDE A PHYSICAL MEETING LOCATION FOR ALL TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS. WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HAS POSED A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISK IN THE MIDST OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. IN THE PAST YEAR MANY HOAS HAVE FOUND THAT ORGANIZING IN PERSON MEETINGS AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LAWS. HAS BEEN IMPRACTICAL UNSAFE OR EVEN ILLEGAL. IN RESPONSE TO THIS THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION WORK LAST FALL TO CRAFT A VERY NARROW POLICY RECOMMENDATION THAT SETS BEFORE US TODAY. SB THREE NINETY ONE SIMPLY WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AN IN PERSON MEETING LOCATION FOR TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY OR DISASTER. TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL NUMBER SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THIS BILL REQUIRES HOAS TO FULFILL CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THEY MUST PROVIDE CLEAR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE. THE MEETING NOTICE MUST INCLUDE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL THE PERSON WHO CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE TELECONFERENCE PROCESS BOTH BEFORE. AND DURING THE MEETING. THEY MUST ENSURE THAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND MEMBER HAS THE ABILITY TO PROCESS IT PURCHASE WITH THE SAME ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING THAT WOULD EXIST IF THE MEETING WERE HELD IN PERSON. ANY VOTER THE DIRECTOR SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY ROLL CALL VOTE AND LASTLY PARTICIPANT SHALL BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF PARTICIPATING BY PHONE. FROM OFFERS TO GLOBAL PANDEMICS RECENT EMERGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA HAS SHOWN THAT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE OR SAFE. FOR ASSOCIATIONS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON MEETING LOCATIONS. THAT IS WHY SB THREE NINETY ONE A PERMISSIVE BILL THAT SIMPLY GIVES HOAS ANOTHER OPTION TO MEET SAFELY DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCIES. THE SAME OPTION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES IS SO URGENTLY NEEDED. TODAY WE HAVE WITH US TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY BRIAN HEY BEAR. OF THE CALIFORNIA CLAREVIEW COMMISSION PAPER I'M SORRY YOU BURKE- INTERTEXTUAL A COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION ATTORNEY FROM ORANGE COUNTY. WHOSE FIRM PROVIDES LEGAL COUNSEL FOR HUNDREDS OF ASSOCIATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU SO I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED BRIAN HUBERT AND DIRK PATCHELL BRIAN HUBERT. YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I AM BRINGING A BIRD ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION AND WE ARE IN A STATE AGENCY THAT CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AN OPEN PUBLIC MEETINGS SO. THE PANDEMIC STAY AT HOME. POSED A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS FOR US BOB THAT'S BECAUSE THE BACK LOOKING- ACT APPLIES TO STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES REQUIRES THAT TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS INCLUDED IN PERSON COMPONENTS- THAT PROBLEM WAS SOLVED BY IT FOR US BY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THE DURATION OF THIS EMERGENCY. BUT WE KNEW THAT THE SAME PROBLEM EXISTED FOR COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT THAT HAD NOT BEEN SOLVED- SO THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO ACT QUICKLY TO PREPARE A NARAL RECOMMENDATION. THAT WOULD SIMPLY WAVES THE IN PERSON REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS. DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY IF THE H. AWAY FOLLOWS A CERTAIN BASIC PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT MEMBERS HAD. THE SAME RIGHTS TO OBSERVE AND PARTICIPATE THAT THEY WHAT HAPPENS TO MEETING WERE HELD IN PERSON WHICH- I AM HERE TODAY MOSTLY JUST TO- PROVIDE- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY- I THANK YOU. THANK YOU THERE WE ALSO TOOK PARTIAL. ARE YOU WITH US. I AM WITH YOU- CHAIRPERSON STONE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DARK PATCHELL- I AM A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND YOU ARE CURRENTLY AT A TEAM OF ATTORNEYS THAT REPRESENT MANY HUNDREDS OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE C. ID'S IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE. ABOUT SIXTEEN MONTHS AGO WITH THE ONSET OF OUR COVERT EMERGENCY WITH OUR OUR COMMUNITIES FACED WITH REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. CID COMMITTEE AS WE KNOW ARE GOVERNED BY OUR VOLUNTEER HOMEOWNER BOARDS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO ACT IN PART THROUGH OPEN MEETINGS OF THE BOARD. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT OPEN MEETINGS PROVIDE FOR A PHYSICAL LOCATION FOR ASSOCIATION MEMBERS TO ATTEND HOWEVER AS WE KNOW STATE AND LOCAL MANDATES PROVIDED PREVENTED- GATHERING AND EVEN IF THEY TECHNICALLY WERE NOT PROHIBITED VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS RESIDENTS AND PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOLDING PHYSICAL LOCATION OPEN FOR MEETINGS. AS SUCH AT A REALLY CRITICAL AN EXTREMELY BUSY TIME IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR VOLUNTEER BOARDS TO DO THEIR JOBS. AND SO. AS WE ALL KNOW BY NECESSITY THE BROWN ACT IN THE OTHER STATE LAWS WERE QUICKLY MODIFIED OR SUSPENDED HOWEVER THE C. ID'S DID NOT SEE THAT RELIEF NONETHELESS EVEN WITHOUT THAT CHANGE THE OPEN MEETING ACT AT THE TIME THE CáC ID'S DRIVEN BY THE SAME NECESSITIES AS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. AND WITH SOME PROTECTION FROM OUR GOVERNOR'S ORDER STARTED CONDUCTING THOSE MEETINGS BY VIDEO CONFERENCE WITHOUT PHYSICAL LOCATION AND THAT ENABLED US TO FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WELL WE PROTECT. ALL INVOLVED FROM THE COVETED ISSUES. THEN WE GOT REALLY INTERESTING HAPPENED. A THE BOARD WE TALKED. AT AND INVOLVEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN AGE RESTRICTED COMMUNITY- FIFTY FIVE PLUS COMMUNITY AS MANY KNOW THEM. ABOUT A THOUSAND DOORS THAT'S REPORTING A MORE THAN A 100% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THE PARTICIPATION AT THAT MEETING BUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. WITH ANOTHER AGE RESTRICTED COMMUNITY OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOORS THAT SAYING THAT INCREASE WAS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. SO SB THREE NINETY ONE IS VERY SIMPLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY. AND ALLOW THEIR COMMUNITIES TO CONDUCT THEIR BOARD MEETINGS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL LOCATION IN A MANNER JUST LIKE THIS CALL. ALL WHILE INCORPORATING ENHANCED NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ENHANCED TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS AND ALL WHILE FULLY MAINTAINING ALL PRE EXISTING COMMUNITY RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS SO. BASED ON ALL OF THAT I PERSONALLY URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE NINETY ONE WITH YOUR VOTE TODAY. I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I'LL REMAIN ON THE LINE TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OTHERS WHO WANT TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D IKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR SB THREE NINETY ONE. SEEING NONE IN THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM SIR LINE ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT COMMISSIONER AND I'M ALSO A RESIDENT OF A THREE THOUSAND UNIT- RETIREMENT COMMUNITY GOVERNED BY NATURE HEY.

A MORE COHERENT AND DETAILED STATEMENT TO THE COMMITTEE I'M SORRY THAT IS SEVEN WE DO DOES NOT ALLOWED YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. THREE MINUTES OKAY WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND CONTINUE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE HELP FOR AMENDMENTS TO SP THREE NINETY ONE. HOWEVER ONE TROUBLING ISSUE REMAINS. AND THAT IS THE PRINT VERSION THAT LITERALLY BELIEVES TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN ASSOCIATION LECTIONS. WHETHER THE ELECTIONS ARE FOR BOARD DIRECTORS ORDER SET SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS THE ONE REMAINING OBJECTIONABLE PROVISION CREATES A NEW OPPORTUNITY. FOR ABUSE OF THE ELECTION PROCEDURE BY INCUMBENT BOARDS BY PERMITTING CANCELLATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE IN PERSON NEEDING TO WITNESS THE OPENING AND TABULATION OF BALLOTS. OFTEN WANT TO BUILD BEFORE A COMMITTEE WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON ITS FUTURE IMPACT BUT NOT SO WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE ASSOCIATIONS ARE ALREADY BEHAVING AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO NINETY ONE THE LAW AND HOMEOWNERS ARE REPORTING TO US THE ABUSES THAT DIDN'T GENERATE. WE OFFER DO. LEETON EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF ABUSES THAT OCCUR. WHEN IN PERSON WITNESSING IS ELIMINATED. A BOARD ELECTION IN VENTURA COUNTY ASSOCIATION WHERE MEMBERS SHOULD MEETING WAS HELD LIKE TRONIC MEDIAN SPECTER OF ELECTIONS PAID A BRIEF APPEARANCE THEN THE- CAMERA SWITCHED AWAY FROM THE INSPECTOR WHILE THE ACTUAL OPENING AND COUNTING OF BALLOTS TOOK PLACE TO COUNTY THE WAY SHE- AND THEN CAME BACK ONLY TO ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. JACKET ABOARD ALEXION IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THE BOARD PRESIDENT WAS HOSTING IT NEEDED ONLY FIVE MEMBERS THAT REVIEWS THAT THAT THE OTHER HOMEOWNERS AND THE CAMERA SHOWED ONLY THE TOP OF THE INSPECTORS HAD TO THAT POINT NO ONE COULD SEE WAS ACTUALLY BEING. DONE AND THE WORST EXAMPLE HAVE HEARD OF. THAT OCCURRED LAST MONTH WHEN A LOS ANGELES CA TO WAKE COUNTY VOTE. ON THE PHONE WITH NO VIDEO AT ALL. AND THE DECLARED RESULT OF THIS SUPPOSED THE BOOK WAS APPROVAL OF A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER OWNER. WE OFFER THE THREE EXAMPLES BUT SURMISED THAT THE PRACTICE. OF SHUTTING HOMEOWNERS OUT OF NEEDING JOHNNY DOT WIDESPREAD. AND DIFFICULT ONLY RIGID MIGHT BE CUTTING DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE. AN EARLIER DRAFT TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATED THAT THIS STANDARD OPPOSED THREE NINETY ONE QUOTE BECAUSE IT ISN'T UNDIMMED ANTI DEMOCRATIC POWER GRAB DESIGNED TO UTILIZE THE GUYS OF EMERGENCY TO TRAMPLE THE RIGHTS OF HOMEOWNERS. IT'S NOT HERPES. BUT RATHER THESE ARE THE WORDS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND IN FACT THE- AND NOW TO HAVE BEEN RE WRITTEN AND THAT DIDN'T- EXERCISE HOWEVER GIVEN THE REPORTED WE HEAR. THE ANALYSIS MAY INDEED BE ARTICULATING IMPACT OBSERVATION. SOME PROPONENT THAT SB THREE NINE ONE KNOWINGLY PROMOTE MISCONDUCT. ABAI H.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES ON SB THREE NINETY ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE STATE SENATOR MAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS WOULD REALLY JUST BE IF THERE WAS A STATE OF EMERGENCY CORRECT SO THE BILL YES SO FIRST- IT ALLOWS FOR VIDEO CONFERENCING OR TELECONFERENCING IF THERE IS A CLEAR ITS EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTIONS THAT IS EVEN NARROWER SO WE TOOK AMENDMENTS WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT ELECTIONS. AND WE AMENDED THE BILL TO SAY THAT VIRTUAL ACTIONS CAN TAKE PLACE ONLY WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET FIRST THE PROCLAIMED- DISASTER EMERGENCY MAKES IT UNSAFE OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER IN PERSON THAT IS A NARROWER SUBSET FURTHERMORE THE MEETINGS AT WHICH BALLOTS ARE RECOUNTED IN TABULATING TABULATED MUST BE DONE BY VERY VIDEO CONFERENCE AND A CAMERA MUST BE PLACED IN A LOCATION SUCH THAT MEMBERS CAN WITNESS THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS COUNTING IN TABULATING EACH VOTE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION WITNESS THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THESE ELECTIONS DID NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF OUR BILL IT TOOK PLACE BEFORE WE EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS BILL BEFORE THIS BILL WAS PROPOSED ALL OF THIS WAS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE HOAS ANOTHER C. ID'S DID NOT HAVE ANY PROCEDURES TO ME THEY CHOSE TO MEET VIRTUALLY AND ALL OF THE PURPORTED ELECTION MISCONDUCT TOOK PLACE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT OF A WILD WEST WITH NO PROCEDURES. ARE BILL WOULD CREATE PROCEDURES TO- TO LOOK AT THESE VOTES TO TABULATE THE VOTES AND HAVE THEM VISUALLY INSPECTED IF THESE PROCEDURES WERE NOT FOLLOWED IT GIVES THE RESIDENTS OF ANY C. AIDID RECOURSE THE SAME LAWS AND PROCEDURES THAT EXIST FOR ANY VIOLATION OF H. SHOW A PROCEDURE SO WE PROVIDE SOME PROCEDURES AND RECORDS THAT DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW AND THE CONDUCT IT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE OPPOSITION WITNESS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A LEGAL UNDER BILL. GREAT I CAN TLL YOU THAT I SERVED ON MY BOARD FOR TEN YEARS AND WAS PRESIDENT- DURING CALVET AND IT WAS- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ATTEND THESE MEETINGS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE OLDER OR THEIR WORK SCHEDULE WASN'T WORKING BUT THAT SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WOULD BE- UNDER TO BE A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WILL LOOK TO ADD YOU TO PROBE TIME COMMENTS. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AND I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BILL CALDWELL PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAU. TO DAVIES FIFTY SECOND SALAS GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES RESIDE. THE BILL IS OUT OF NUMBER TEN SB SIX FIFTY FOUR. ALL RIGHT YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SORRY AND I PRESENTING SIX IF YOU WANNA GO HEAD THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN CHAIR STONE THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF AGAIN SB SIX FIFTY FOUR CREATES NEW PROTECTIONS AND EXAMS EXTENDS EXISTING SAFEGUARDS FOR CHILDREN IN FAMILY COURT SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE LONG OVERDUE FIRST SB SIX FIFTY FOUR PREVENTS A CHILD'S TESTIMONY- FROM BEING GIVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PARTY SEEKING CUSTODY SUCH AS A CHILD'S PARENTS UNLESS IT IS SEEN AS NECESSARY. THAT WOULD REVERSE THE ORDER OF THE PRIORITIZATION RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEFAULT IS OFTEN- THE IDEA THAT THE CHILD WILL GIVE TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF PARENTS SOMETHING THEY CAN BE VERY TRAUMATIZING- SECOND- AND I THINK IT IS. YOU KNOW CLEARLY USEFUL AND NECESSARY FOR CHILDREN TO TESTIFY. SOMETIMES IT IS NECESSARY TO FOR THOSE THESE CHILDREN TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS. BUT ATTORNEYS AND CHILD ADVOCATES HAVE REPORTED ACROSS THE BOARD THAT. I'M GENERALLY SPEAKING TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF ONE'S PARENTS AT THIS AGE IN IN THESE CONTENTIOUS. CUSTODY BATTLES CAN CAUSE LONG TERM EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND HARM. CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND SO AS SUCH THE FIRST COMPONENT THIS BILL ENSURES THAT CHILDREN. ARE ONLY PLACED IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE FORCED TO TESTIFY FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN IT'S DEEMED NECESSARY. AND ALSO CLARIFIES THAT CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT HOW THEY WISH TO PROVIDE INPUT. SECONDLY SB SIX FIFTY FOUR TAKES EXISTING SAFETY MEASURES. USED RELATED TO CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATION. AND EXTENDS THEM TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATION. CURRENTLY JUDGES MUST CONSIDER A HISTORY OF ABUSE OR DRUG ADDICTION WHEN PLACING CHILDREN IN THE CUSTODY OF. INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE BACKGROUNDS. AND IF A JUDGE PLACES A CHILD IN THE CUSTODY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AN ABUSIVE. BACKGROUND THEY MUST STATE THEIR REASONS ON THE RECORD- THIS STATUS QUO INSURES THAT DOCUMENTATION OF THESE DETERMINATIONS ARE CAPPED. A DECISION IS MADE IN THIS HELPS TO SAVE LIVES. BUT THE SAME REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS WHICH CAN BE EQUALLY PROBLEMATIC AND EVEN DEADLY. A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN STUDY BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE. FOUND THAT 47% OF CUSTODY EVALUATORS CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND. AND SUPERVISED VISITATION WITH THE PARENTS. EVEN WHEN THERE ARE REPORTS OF VIOLENCE IN AT HOME. UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS CAN LAST DAYS AND OFTEN PUT CHILDREN IN DANGER. A TWELVE YEAR NATIONAL STUDY SHOWS THAT MANY CHILD HOMICIDE VICTIMS. WERE MURDERED BY DIVORCING OR SEPARATED PARENTS. DURING COURT ORDERED UNSUPERVISED VISITATION WITH THE MURDER. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE COURTS WERE NOTIFIED AWARE OF A HISTORY OF ABUSE. AND EVIDENCE OF THREATS TO HARM THE CHILDREN. SB SIX FIFTY FOUR EXTENDS THE SAME SAFETY REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY APPLY TO CHILD CUSTODY TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATION. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING PRACTICES. AND WHAT MAY SEEM LIKE A MINOR CHANGE THIS IS A CHANGE WE BELIEVE WILL SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY CHILDREN. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME DOES TESTIFYING SUPPORT KIM ROBINSON A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY. AND TRACY FELL OVER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR YOLO COUNTY C. A. S. A. THANK YOU WE DO A MOTION AND A SECOND SO I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED KEN ROBINSON AND TRACY FARMER. JIM ROBINSON PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THANK YOU BUT AS THE SENATORS STATED- I IN FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY WITH OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE- MANY OF MY CASES ARE HIGH CONFLICT BECAUSE THEY ARE INVOLVED. ISSUES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE- THIS BILL DOES TOO- TWO IMPORTANT THINGS ONE IS THAT IT REQUIRES ANY COURT THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW. UNSUPERVISED VISITATION BETWEEN A CHILD AND A PARENT WITH A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE OR ABUSE THAT THAT THE COURT MUST ISSUE WRITTEN FINDINGS AS TO HOW SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT SUCH VISITATION WOULD BE IN THAT CHILD'S BEST INTEREST. AND THAT IT WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE THE CHILD'S SAFETY EXISTING LAW DOES NOT PUT THAT REQUIREMENT UPON THE COURT- SECONDLY THIS BILL- AMEND FAMILY CODE SECTION THREE ZERO FOUR TWO WHICH IS A STATUTE THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO GIVE TESTIMONY TO THE COURT REGARDING. THEIR CUSTOM ORDEAL PREFERENCES MOST CHILDREN IN MOST CUSTODY CASES DO NOT WISH TO TESTIFY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED BUT IN THOSE FEW CASES WHERE THEY DO THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THE COURTS TO. ESSENTIALLY SET UP ACE FOR CHILD FRIENDLY SETTING IN WHICH THE CHILDREN CAN SPEAK OPENLY AND HONESTLY ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER DEAL- PREFERENCES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES- GOING ON IN THEIR LIFE THAT THE COURT MAY. TAKE INPUT. AND MAKE BETTER ORDERS. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE ANY. THANK YOU WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR A RECORD PLEASE. I YES I DIDN'T KIM RBINSON I AM A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY IN OAKLAND YES THANK YOU. AND THEN TRACY FARMER. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRACY FATHER I AM A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YOLO COUNTY CASA. AN ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE VIEWS THAT THEY COLLECTED CHILDREN. TODAY WE UNDERSTAND THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAINS AND BODIES OF CHILDREN BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE WE NOW KNOW THAT TRAUMATIC STRESS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES. HAS A PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN CHILDHOOD. AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE LIFE COURSE. A GROUNDBREAKING ACES STUDY PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY DOCTORS SINCE IT'S ALREADY OF KAISER PERMANENTE A AND ROBERT ON THE OF THE CDC. AND SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH AROUND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN CHILDREN HAS DRAMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THE EXPOSURE AND DOSE OF TRAUMATIC STRESS CHILDREN EXPERIENCE. SB SIX FIFTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THE COURTS TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF TRAUMATIC STRESS OF CHILDREN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN TAKING THEIR TESTIMONY IN FAMILY COURT. ORDERED WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT UNSUPERVISED VISITATION IN CASES WHERE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE BECAUSE THIS. ENSURING THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT JUST PHYSICALLY BUT ALSO EMOTIONALLY SAFE DURING COURT PROCEEDINGS AND THE SEPARATION OF THEIR PARENTS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM WELL BEING. CASA VOLUNTEERS WHO ACCOMPANY CHILDREN TO COURT HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THE TOXIC STRESS THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCE WHEN APPEARING IN COURT EVEN WHEN SPEAKING UP FOR THEIR NEEDS. IF IT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS AGAINST THE WISHES OR DESIRES SOME PARENTS. YES CHILDREN ARE FREQUENTLY VERY WILLING TO BE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL WHEN THEY FEEL SAFE. IT IS TIME FOR THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM TO CREATE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR THE CHILD RATHER THAN EXPECTING THE CHILD TO ADAPT TO THE CONDITIONS SET BY THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM. LET US ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED PROTECTED FROM ABUSE NEGLECT AND CONTINUED PAKCIK STRESS WHENEVER WE ARE ABLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT THANK YOU.

DAVIES DAVIES I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HI HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES RESIDE BECAUSE OF THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU RIGHT I REMEMBER ELEVEN SB SIX SIX ZERO CENTER NEWMAN. AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M HERE BEFORE TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SB SIX SIXTY. IT'S PROVISIONS WILL PROHIBIT COMMON PRACTICES IN THE GATHERING OF SIGNATURES FOR BALLOT MEASURES WHICH INCENTIVIZE THE WILLFUL DECEPTION VOTERS IN DOING SO SB SIX SIXTY WILL TAKE NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIANS. INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESSES AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES A RECENT ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROLE IN PROSECUTING PROSPECTIVE VIOLATION UNDER THE BILL'S PROVISIONS WHEN ENACTED- AND OUT OF THE BILL IN CHIEF. AS YOU MAY BE AWARENESS TO COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF A NUMBER OF STATES WHOSE CONSTITUTIONS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED CITIZENS WITH TOOLS TO DIRECTLY REDRESS ABUSES OF GOVERNMENT OR MALFEASANCE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN OUR CASE IN THE FORM OF THE INITIATIVE. THE REFERENDUM AND THE RECALL FIRST SOME HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT THESE ADMIRABLE AND USEFUL CONSTITUTION DIRECT DEMOCRACY PROVISIONS DATE BACK MORE THAN A CENTURY AND ARE THE LEGACY OF A GROUP OF PROGRESSIVE REFORMERS LED BY THEN GOVERNOR HIRAM JOHNSON. WHO THEN WENT ON TO BECOME CALIFORNIA'S LONGEST SERVING REPRESENTATIVE UNITED STATES SENATE UNTIL HIS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE RECENTLY ECLIPSED BY OUR OWN STANDARD DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FEINSTEIN. AS A RESULT&lt;/c&gt; OF THE EFFORTS OF GOVERNOR JOHNSON AND HIS SUPPORTERS CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION THROUGH THE INITIAL REFERENDUM AND RECALL MAKES EXPLICIT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR THE CITY'S REACH SURGERY TO TAKE ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL ELECTION. AND LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES IN ORDER TO ENACT OR REPEAL LEGISLATION OR TO REMOVE A CORRUPT OR MALFEASANCE ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM OFFICE- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT RIGHT NOW- THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON THE CURRENT EFFORT. TO RECALL GOVERNOR NEWSOM- IF ENACTED IT WILL BE WELL AFTER THAT ALL TAKES PLACE. TO THE ORIGINAL FRAMERS WAY OF THINKING THE INITIAL REFERENDUM AND RECALL REPRESENTED A MEANS FOR THE LITTLE GUY TO ACHIEVE DIRECT CURATIVE AND REFORMIST ACTIONS THAT ELECTED INVESTED INTEREST MIGHT OTHERWISE FORT BECAUSE THE FRAMERS OF THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL REGARD. THESE PROCESSES AS POP LIST. OF LESS RESORT THE- PROVIDE THAT ORDER TO. FOR THE BALLOT THE PROPONENTS OF ANY OF THESE DIRECT TO THE VOTERS PLEASE BESIDES. WOULD FIRST BE REQUIRED TO GATHER A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF VOTER SIGNATURES TO VALIDATE THE LEGITIMACY AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR SUCH AN ACTION. OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY IN IN RECENT DECADES HOWEVER SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE FRAMERS INTENDED HAS TRANSPIRED. THESE TOOLS OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY HAVE IN FACT BEEN EFFECTIVELY CO OPTED BY THE VERY MONEYED INTERESTS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED. TO OFFSET. AS WELL FUNDED GROUPS WITH INCREASINGLY EXPLICIT SELF INTERESTED MOTIVATIONS HAVE BECOME EVER MORE ADEPT AT USING INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS IS TO THEIR BENEFIT. SOMETHING OF AN ARMS RACE AROUND THESE PROCESSES HAS ENSUED ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO SIGNATURE GATHERING. AT THE CENTER OF THESE EFFORTS A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIALIZED FIRMS WITH EXPERTISE IN SEIZURE GATHERING. HAVE RISEN TO THE FORE OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO PROPONENTS SEEKING TO PLACE A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL TACTICS USED BY THE SPECIALIZING TOGETHER INFERENCE IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF WELL TRAINED PROFESSIONAL SIGNATURE GATHERERS TYPICALLY IS USED THE SIGNATURE GATHERS. ARE PAID ON A PER SIGNATURE OR COMMISSION BASIS ALSO KNOWN AS A BOUNTY. AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET AS IT IS ASSESSED AT THE TIME. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ISSUE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISTRICT. THE TIME OF YEAR OR COMPETITION WITH OTHER NATIONS AT A GIVEN TIME TO COST PROCEDURE CAN VARY WIDELY FROM AS LOW AS TWO DOLLARS PER STRING TOGETHER TO AS HIGH AS TWENTY DOLLARS. AND BECAUSE BOUNTY PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO OPTIMIZE THEIR YIELD BASED ON OW RAPIDLY THEY CAN SECURE SIGNATURES FROM VOTERS. THEY FRANKLY TRAFFIC MISDIRECTION MISLEADING INFORMATION AND OUTRIGHT FALSEHOODS IN ORDER TO INDUCE AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE TO SIGN IN THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THE DETERMINING FACTOR GETTING A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT TOO OFTEN HAS LESS TO DO WITH ITS POLICY MERITS. THEN WITH THE DEPTH OF HIS PROPONENTS POCKETS OF COURSE THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE FRAMERS HAD IN MIND. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE PERVERSE INCENTIVES THE PAPER SIGNATURE SYSTEM HAS SUBVERTED THE ORIGINAL IDEALISTIC CONTENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUNDERS WHO ENVISIONED A PEOPLE POWER IT'S JUST OF REF. AND VALIDATED BY DEMONSTRATED PUBLIC SUPPORT AND WHICH WOULD SUCCEED OR FAIL ON THEIR MERITS NOT ON HOW WILL THE SYSTEM. MIGHT BE GAME. THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS HE SHOULD AND- CAN AND SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT VALUED ROLE IN CALIFORNIA POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR HOWEVER THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE BOUNTIES THERE ARE SCANT PROSPECTS. FOR DETERRING BAD ACTORS WHO WILLFULLY MISLEAD VOTERS AT THE EXPENSE. OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS SB SIX SIXTY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE. BY PROHIBITING THE PRACTICE OF PAYING SIX TOGETHERS ON A PERSONAL BASIS WHEN COLLECTING SIGNATURES TO PLACE A STATE. OR LOCAL INITIATIVE REFERENDUM A RECALL ON THE BALLOT. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY NOTES THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT PROHIBIT IS PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING. IN OTHER WAYS TOGETHER STILL COULD BE PAID AN HOURLY WAGE RATE SALARY OR OFFER BONUSES BASED ON THEIR PERFORMANCE. THIS GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASUREMENT WILL SERVE. TO STRENGTHEN A RECALL REFERENDUM ISSUE PROCESS BY ENSURING THAT VOTERS ARE AWARE OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING AND NOT BEING DECEIVED I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OUTLOOK TODAY. THANK YOU I DO NOT HAVE ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES LISTED SO IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF SB. SIX SIXTY. SEEING NONE REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE.

GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU AUDIBLE YOUR MEMBERS- MINUS WHAT MUHAMMAD WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SIX SIXTY SB SIX SIXTY PROHIBITS SIGNATURE COLLECTION ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS FOR STATE OR LOCAL INITIATIVES- BUT BY BANNING SIGNATURE GATHERING ON PAYPOINT PER SIGNATURE BASIS THIS BILL DOES COMPEL PEOPLE TO BEAR THE COST OF HIRING HOURLY EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS WITH HOURLY EMPLOYEES TO COLLECT THOSE SIGNATURES. AND DISINCENTIVE EYES OF THOSE WORKERS IN COLLECTING SIGNATURES BY DOING THIS THE BILL NOT ONLY SLOWS DOWN THE SIGNATURE GATHERING PROCESS BUT DOES MAKE IT PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO CIRCULATE IN ADDITION IF RECALL FOR NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO PROPOSE A REFERENDUM. SB SIX SIXTY ALSOMIXES CALIFORNIA BALLOT PROP MEASURES WITH THE RISK OF PRIVILEGE WITH PRIVILEGE LITIGATION BY CREATING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE ITS PROVISIONS THIS WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT PROCESS FINALLY THE BILL ONCE FOR DEMONSTRABLE PROOF OF FRAUD STEMMING FROM SPECIFICALLY FROM THE PAYMENT PER SIGNATURE METHOD OF COLLECTION INFORMATION FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE INDICATES THAT. IN THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ONLY FIFTY FIVE CASES FOR POTENTIAL PETITION FRAUD WERE REFERRED FOR PROSECUTION- CONSIDERING THESE ISSUES- WE MUST- RESPECTFULLY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- AS YOU KNOW FOR MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS REAL PROPERTY IS THE ONLY ASSET THAT. THEY CAN PASS TO THEIR ERRORS ONE WAY TO CONVEY PROPERTY TO AN ERROR ISRAEL WILL OR TRUST BOTH OF WHICH- FREQUENTLY REQUIRE PROBATE OR ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEY CONSULTATION AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE. ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WITHOUT RESOURCES. IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED. IRREVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED PROVIDES A MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE MECHANISM OTHER THAN PROBATE. IT'S JUST ANOTHER TOOL FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED ASSETS UNCOMPLICATED HOLDINGS. AND SIMPLY A HOME. THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED WAS CREATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AB ONE THIRTY NINE. TO ALLOW OWNERS OF REAL PROPERTY TO TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY UPON DEATH OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL PROBATE PROCEDURE. THIS PILOT PROGRAM PROGRAM HAS A CURRENT SUNSET DATE AS YOU KNOW OF JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. THIS BILL SENATE BILL THREE ONE FIVE IS SPECIFICALLY BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. CONTAINED IN A REPORT COMPLETED BY THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION. AND IF ADOPTED WILL EXTEND THE SUNSET DATE UNTIL JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND THIRTY TWO. ALLOW THE USE OF A REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED TO TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY TO A PUBLIC ENTITY IF THEY CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT. I WOULD NONPROFIT ENTITY OR TRUST STRENGTHENED TRANSFER OR AND BENEFICIARY PROTECTIONS SUCH AS REQUIRING THE DEED BE SIGNED BY TWO WITNESSES REQUIRING THE BENEFICIARY GIVE NOTICE TO THE TRANS FORCED ERRORS WHEN THE TRANSFER DOES AND ALLOW COURTS THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFERS INTENT. IF THERE'S AMBIGUITY AN ISSUE ARISES SIMILAR TO THE WAY THOSE ISSUES ARE DEALT WITH TODAY WITH RESPECT TO WILLS AND TRUSTS RESTRUCTURE THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE BENEFICIARIES LIABILITY FOR THE DECEASED TRANSFERS AND SECURE DEBTS. AND GIVE THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION ADDITIONAL TIME TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THESE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS TO EVALUATE WHETHER NEW REFORMS OR OR ADDITIONAL REFORMS ARE REQUIRED AND MAKE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CONTINUATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS PARTICULAR TOOL. ON THE LINETODAY I HAVE WITH ME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION MISTER BROWN HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU OR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED BRIAN HE BURKE FROM THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION.

BUT THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZED THAT FOR YEARS IT IS A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO EVALUATE AN INSTRUMENT THAT ONLY OPERATES ON GAS SO THAT'S WHY THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED- DESPITE NOT HAVING IT- DISCOVERED ANY SERIOUS PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME RECOMMENDED EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE- BY ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND- REQUIRING A FOLLOW UP STUDY OF THE COMMISSION PRIOR TO THE- THE DATE THAT THAT WOULD OPERATE- GROUND AS SENATOR RAWSON THE ANALYSIS- BOTH- EXPLAINS.

THE ACTUAL COMMITTEE- ANALYSIS POINTS OUT- THAT THE AMENDMENTS- TAKING THIS COMMITTEE ARE MINOR AND I HATE- EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE REPORT THANK YOU ALTHOUGH I THINK AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN PRIOR. RIGHT BUT- THANK YOU ANYWAY. OKAY I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED CAN PLACEMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND JULIAN BURNS KING OF KING AND SIEGEL. CAN WEARING ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEN WEIGHING IN ON THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY ASSOCIATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION HE LED THE PROUD SPONSOR SB SEVEN SIXTY TWO WHICH WOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND EXPEDIENCY AND CONSUMER EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB SEVEN OH SEVEN WHICH GAVE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS PROCEDURAL OPTIONS IN THE EVENT THAT A COMPANY FAILED TO PAY THEIR SHARE OF ARBITRATION FEES. BUT THAT LAW LEFT IN AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHEN ARBITRATION P. PAYMENTS ARE DUE. MEANING THAT CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYEES ARE LEFT IN THE DARK WHEN A COMPANY PREACHER THIRTY OBLIGATION. THE CLOUD COMPANIES TO PRIVATELY OBTAIN AN EXTENSION OF PAYMENT FROM THE ARBITRATION PROVIDER IN SOME CASES EVEN AFTER DUE DATE AND PASSED. WITH DELAYED PROCEEDINGS AT LEAST CLAIMANTS TO WONDER WHETHER THEIR CLAIMS WILL BE MOVING FORWARD AT ALL. ASSEMBLY CUTIE FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF ARBITRATION AS AN EXPEDIENT FORM TO RESOLVE DISPUTE. THIS IS WHY SB SEVENTY TWO IS SO IMPORTANT THIS BILL WOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING ARBITRATION PROVIDERS TO DISCLOSE TO ALL PARTIES THAT MOUNT A FEW DO AND THEIR DUE DATE. THE BILL WOULD FURTHER CLARIFY THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES TO OBTAIN EXTENSIONS TO BE PAYMENT. FINALLY THE BILL WOULD APPLY DEFAULT TERM FOR PAYING OUR CREATION FEES WHAT THE ORIGINAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS SILENT ABOUT THE TIMING OF PAYMENT. IF NECESSARY CLASSIFICATION PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY IN THE FORM AND GIVE CLAIMING THE CHANCE TO BE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TO DESCRIBE HOW THIS LOOPHOLE HAS HURT WORKERS AND CONSUMERS JULIAN BROWN CAME TO JOIN AS A PARTNER AT KING AND SEGAL LLP WHICH REPRESENTS WORKERS FACING DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT AT WORK. HENRY MORNING SHARON MEMBERS MORNING. MY NAME IS JULIAN BARNES KING AND I AM A LOS ANGELES BASED ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES IN DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CASES IN COURT AND ARBITRATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF SB SEVEN OH SEVEN TWENTY NINETEEN MANY OF OUR CLIENTS EXPERIENCED FRUSTRATION AND DELAY IN RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION BECAUSE COMPANIES WERE INTENTIONALLY DELAYING PAYMENT OF ARBITRATION FEES. SB SEVEN OH SEVEN HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT AN UNNECESSARY AMBIGUITY AND NOT LIVE TO WIN AN INVOICES DEAL HAD LEFT OPEN A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO DELAY PROCEEDINGS BY PRIVATELY OBTAINING EXTENSIONS TO BE PAYMENT. THIS PRACTICE HAS SERIOUSLY HARMED OUR CLIENTS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE A SINGLE MOTHER WHO WAS FIRED AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT ILLEGAL PRACTICES AT A REVERSE MORTGAGE LENDER IN HER CASE EVEN THOUGH THE ARBITRATION PROVIDER SPECIFIED ON THE INVOICE PER PIECE THAT PAYMENTS WERE DUE UPON RECEIPT THE RESPONDENT FAILED TO PAY FEES FOR NEARLY SIXTY DAYS AFTER IT WAS DUE RESULTING AN ARBITRATOR CLOSING THE CASE AND THEY KIDDING HER PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED HEARING DATE. WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFICATION MY CLIENT'S CASE WAS ON HOLD FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND WE TRIED TO ASSERT HER RIGHTS ADDRESS THE SEVEN OH SEVEN IN COURT ONLY TO LOSE BECAUSE OF AN AMBIGUITY AS TO WHEN AN INVOICE IS DUE SB SEVEN SIXTY TWO WOULD END THE CONFUSION BY REQUIRING ARBITRATION PROVIDERS DESPITE ALL PARTIES WITH THE INVOICE CONTAINING THE DUE DATE AND THE AMOUNT DUE AND PREVENTING. THE CRITICS ACTION IN MY CLIENT CASE THIS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HER TO AFFECT THE PROCEDURAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO HER UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN THE COMPANY. FAILED TO PAY THEIR SHARE OF THE FEES. THAT'S WHY WE NEED AT SEVEN SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU. WAS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. THANK YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN SIXTY TWO. SEEING NONE THE REMOTE WITNESS THE REMOTE SITE.

AND THE SECOND THANK YOU PLEASE WELL THAT WAS. THANK YOU I WILL BE TRY TO BE BRIEF- MEMBERS TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING THIS BILL I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS SEEKING. OUR PROTECTION FROM THEIR ABUSERS SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WILL ALLOW VICTIMS TO FILE ELECTRONICALLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS TO PROVIDE GREATER SAFETY FOR VICTIMS AS THEY TRY TO LEAVE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT JUDGES WILL ALWAYS HAVE DISCRETION AT ALL TIMES. IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO ENSURE THAT IF HERE SHE DEEMS IT'S AN APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE THEY CAN THEY SHOULD THEY WILL NOT ALLOW REMOTE TESTIMONY. AND I AS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN THE RISE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES IN MY OWN COMMUNITY ONE CITY REPORTED OUT WHICH IS INCREDIBLE. IT'S CRITICAL TO ALLOW REMOTE TESTIMONY BECAUSE THE VICTIM IS ALREADY DEALING WITH A LOT OF TRAUMA AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FACE OUR PEACE OR IS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK FREELY. AND TRUTHFULLY AND WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. AT LEAST WE CAN DO ISTRY TO MAKE THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR THEM TO FEEL CONFIDENT AND BE ABLE TO TESTIFY. WE WANT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. ONCE AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO BE PROTECTED. WHAT I DO NOT PERSONALLY IS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRIGGERS ARE VERY UNPREDICTABLE. AND YOU NEVER KNOW IF THAT MOMENT IN FRONT OF THAT ABUSE OR MAYBE THE LAST FOR A VICTIM. I WOULD LIKE IF I MAY TO INTRODUCED OUT TO MY WITNESSES. I HAVE HERE TIßN TORII- WHO IS THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE SAN DIEGO FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. AND MY SECOND WITNESSES. A SURVIVOR LIST BET. AND IF. THEY MAY. CAN THEY BEGIN. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU THOSE ARE WHO WE HAD LISTED I HAD MORE ROOFTOP PRINCE DISENTANGLE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND JULIA WEBER FROM GIFFORDS LAW CENTER SO THOSE ARE NOT. THEY WERE SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY BUT THEY WERE ON HOLD FOR SO LONG AND THEY ENDED UP HAVING TO SEND US SOMEONE TO REPLACE HIMSELF I HOPE THAT'S OKAY THAT'S FINE JUST. TRY TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A RECORD OKAY SO THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR RUBIO'S LEADERSHIP ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES AGAIN I'M DIANE TO ALREADY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN HAS PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING AS WELL. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH SURVIVORS ON A DAILY BASIS I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING RE VICTIMIZED BY THEIR ABUSERS. STEADY SHOW THAT THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMENT WHEN A VICTIM DECIDES TO LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP AND LAND SEEKING A RESTRAINING ORDER. COMMITTEE MEMBERS NEED ADVANCED ANGER THEIR ABUSERS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO RETALIATE. BY TESTIFYING REMOTELY VICTIMS ARE ABLE TO TELL THIS STORY IN COURT WITHOUT FEAR OF PHYSICAL RETALIATION. INTIMIDATION THREATS AND COERCION BY THE DEFENDANT AND THE DEFENDANT FAMILY BEFORE DURING AND AFTER COURT HEARINGS. AT THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER WE'VE CREATED A SPACE WHERE CLIENTS CAN STATE PLEASE SPEAK TO THE COURT. IN A CALM ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FREE OF STRESS AND INTIMIDATION BY THEIR ABUSER AS WELL AS THE CONFUSION OF THE COURTHOUSE. GOOD SPACE KEEPS ARE VICTIMS STATE AND FREE FROM FURTHER DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES SO THEY CAN. THAT THEY CAN ENCOUNTER A COURT. CALIFORNIA HAS NOW HAD MONTHS OF VALUABLE X. WITH REMOTE TEST. ABOUT TESTIMONY ASSISTANT FROM THE MINOR BY THEM FROM THE FEAR OF THE COURT. AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT BENEFITS THE ORDER AND CAR OF THE ROOM. ON BEHALF UNDERSTANDING THE CITY ATTORNEY MARA ELLIOTT I URGE YOU TO PUT VICTIMS FIRST. AND KEEP THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES STATE BY VOTING IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT.

CIGNA SENATOR YOU MAKE MISTAKES SENATE I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU SAY ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOESN'T END AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THIS GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY SAFE- THANKS FOR THIS AND- I'D BE HONORED TO CO AUTHOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. REDUCE YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR- ON. I I'VE I THINK EVERYBODY IS IN A VERY MUCH AGREE UPON THIS AS FOR THE SPECIALLY THE FILING FILING- ONE CONCERN THAT DOES COME UP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST DOING WAS WITH TV IN THIS BILL ALSO DEALING WITH GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. IS HAVING REMOTE TESTIMONY AND- WITH ALL THESE RESTRAINING ORDERS ON. THAT WAS ALL WITH RESTRAINT ORDERS THERE'S ALWAYS A ONE OF THE CONCERNS IT'S RESTRAINED ORDERS IS THERE YOU CAN THEY CAN BE GIVEN EVEN ON A LACK OF NO NOTICE AT ALL. AND WOOD PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE AT YOU KNOW AT ISSUE IN ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDING WHICH IS WHAT THESE ARE- YOU KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE DUE PROCESS AND THAT THERE WOULD BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW. HEAR FROM THOSE WHO ARE TESTIFYING AGAINST THEM. REMOTE I THINK AS WE ARE AS WE KNOW WHAT THESE HEARINGS LIKE REMOTE. TESTIMONY IS NOT ALWAYS. MOST ADEQUATE WAY OF- PROVIDING THAT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD JUST SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT THEY'LL BE LIKE THE ONLY CONCERN THAT. THAT I HAVE HERE IS. GEN CHEVY ISSUE TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY BEING- CONFRONTED WITH ALLEGATIONS OF. A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE WHERE THEY ARE- AT THE END OF THIS THING THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER FILED AGAINST THEM- AND BEING ABLE TO. ACTUALLY HAD TO PROCESS TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW THOSE ALLEGATIONS RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THAT NO AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER ANY DUE PROCESS IT REMAINS THE SAME IT ONLY EXPANDS AXES WHEN YOU GO FILE RESTRAINING ORDER YOU FILED THE RESTRAINING ORDER USED TO HAVE TO APPEAR IN COURT TO PROVE YOUR CASE AND SHOW EVIDENCE AND- TO YOUR POINT MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS IN THIS CASE STILL. AGAIN THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE DUE PROCESS IS JUST- ABOUT IT NOT BEING ABLE TO OFFER E. FILING AND STILL HAVE TO SHOW UP REMOTE TESTIMONY AND PROVE YOUR CASE AND AT ALL TIMES THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION OF THE FEEL THAT. YOU KNOW BY CASE BY CASE BASIS IF THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW THEY'RE ABLE TO SENSE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE THEY STILL HAVE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO IT TO CATCH SOME OF THOSE CASES THAT YOU MAY BE CONCERNED WITH. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENIOR CENTER DO YOU MAKE OF. YES THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS- I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AND YOU KNOW THAT. THE PANDEMIC REALLY HOUSE CASA PANDEMIC WITHIN A PANDEMIC AND AS I NOTED THAT NUMBERS ARE SKY HIGH AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SAFE AT HOME ORDERS DIDN'T QUITE MEAN THE SAME THING ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S VIOLENCE IN THE HOME AND FILL. THIS IS JUST ONE STEP TO HELP BRING VICTIMS OUT OF THE SHUTTLE AND FEEL SAFE THAT THEY CAN AGAIN BE TRUTHFUL AND DA.
