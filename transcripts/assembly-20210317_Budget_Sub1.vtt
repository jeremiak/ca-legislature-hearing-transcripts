CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO MAKE

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.955
FOUR POINTS TODAY BASED ON MY

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:38.490
EXPERIENCE AS A RESEARCHER

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.091

CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:43.294
POVERTY IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.797
NET. FIRST THE DEFINING FEATURE

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.499
OF THIS RECESSION IS A

00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:49.534
BIFURCATION AND DISPARITIES IN

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.169
OPPORTUNITY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.371
RATE CURRENTLY STANDS AT 9% BUT

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:54.973
IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.808
LATINO AND BLACK WORKERS FOR

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:57.475
THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.277
EDUCATION. AND AMONG LOWER

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.046
INCOME FAMILIES. THESE

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:03.715
DISPARITIES PREDATE COVERT

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.150
NINETEEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:06.351
EVEN WITH THE STRONGEST

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:07.886
IMPROVEMENTS FOR LOW INCOME

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.220
FAMILIES WE'VE SEEN ABOUT FORTY

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.122
YEARS ONE FIFTH OF CALIFORNIA

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.425
FAMILIES FOR RELYING ON FORTY

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:14.292
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.095
PER YEAR. WORSE STILL BLACK AND

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.763
LATINO FAMILIES WERE ESPECIALLY

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.131
LIKELY TO BE AND THAT'S LOWER

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.100
INCOME GROUP. WHERE WE ARE

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:23.635
TODAY IS THE RESULT OF A FOUR

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.336
DECADE TREND TOWARDS GREATER

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:28.139
INCOME INEQUALITY AND STAGNANT

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:29.808
PROPERTY. SECOND EVERY

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.376
RECESSION IN THE PAST FOUR

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.744
DECADES HAS EXACERBATED

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.746
ECONOMIC DISPARITIES THE ONE

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:36.414
EXCEPTION IS THE DOT COM BUST.

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.982
MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.184
TOOK TEN TO TWELVE YEARS TO

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.018
RECOVER FROM THE GREAT

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.719
RECESSION AND A BIT LONGER AND

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:43.988
SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SO MANY

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.990
FAMILIES BARELY CAUGHT THEIR

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:47.058
BREATH BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.260
HIT. WE DO EXPECT THAT THIS

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:50.829
RECOVERY MAY BE FASTER

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.197
HOPEFULLY WILL BE FASTER BUT

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:54.899
ALL RECESSION HAVE A LAG. AND

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.434
SO AND THAT LIKE IT'S FELT MORE

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:57.902
SEVERELY FOR LOWER INCOME

00:28:57.969 --> 00:29:00.038
FAMILIES. SO WE REALLY MUST

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.673
BEAR IN MIND THAT EVEN WHEN THE

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.174
ECONOMY WIDE METRIC START TO

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.075
LOOK BETTER LIKE THE

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.443
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. THE

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.378
RECESSION WILL STILL LIKELY BE

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.681
FELT VERY STRONGLY FOR MANY

00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:12.717
CALIFORNIA. THIRD WE NOW KNOW A

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.619
LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKS TO SUPPORT

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:16.421
FAMILIES AND EAT. AND TYPICAL

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.189
TIMES WE KNOW FROM THE PP I

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.724
SEIZE DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.159
POVERTY MEASURE THAT MAJOR

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:22.794
STATE AND FEDERAL SAFETY NET

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.295
PROGRAMS KEEP NEARLY THREE

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:25.663
MILLION CALIFORNIANS OUT OF

POVERTY EVERY YEAR. INCLUDING

00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:30.001
ONE MILLION CHILDREN. CALFRESH

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:31.536
IN TAX CREDITS ARE THE BIGGEST

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:32.470
POVERTY REDUCERS FOR

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.239
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FOLLOWED

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:36.441
BY CAL WORKS. THESE PROGRAMS

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:38.409
ACTUALLY SUPPORT MANY MANY MORE

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.811
CALIFORNIANS IF WE LOOK BEYOND

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.046
THE POVERTY SNAPSHOT AND THINK

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:43.915
ABOUT WELL BEING OVER TIME. AND

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:46.184
RECENT RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.286
50% OF CHILDREN BENEFIT FROM

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.722
CALFRESH CAL WORKS OR BOTH. AT

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:53.358
SOME POINT DURING THEIR FIRST

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.260
FIVE YEARS OF LIFE. WE ALSO

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:55.727
FOUND THAT IN THE LAST

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.762
RECESSION. THE ONLY WITH

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:59.898
CHILDREN FELL DEEPER IN NEED SO

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:01.633
THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO RELY

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.735
ON BOTH CALFRESH AND CAL WORK

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:04.869
WHEN IN REGULAR TIMES THEY MAY

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:07.005
HAVE JUST BEEN- SUPPORTED BY

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:09.674
CALFRESH SO CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.409
POWERS PROGRAM RELATIVE TO

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.278
OTHER STATES REALLY PROVIDED

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.313
VITAL SUPPORT IN THE LAST

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.382
RECESSION. ONE FACTOR THAT

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.349
MIGHT MAKE THE NEED DIFFERENT

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.051
THIS TIME IS THE SCALE OF THE

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.253
FEDERAL STIMULUS THERE IS SOME

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.655
CONSENSUS I BELIEVE AMONG

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:24.789
RESEARCH THAT THE INITIAL

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.758
STIMULUS IN TWENTY TWENTY THE

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.660
CARES ACT- MAY HAVE PREVENTED

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.161
POVERTY FROM IMMEDIATELY

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.330
INCREASING. THE DIRECT STIMULUS

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:33.064
PAYMENTS WERE THE MOST

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.532
CONSEQUENTIAL TO THAT AND

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.401
FOLLOWED BY UNEMPLOYMENT

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.736
INSURANCE EXPANSIONS. HOWEVER

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:40.705
WITH IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.840
LAPSES IN SUPPORT AND GAPS IN

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.676
ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAMS AND

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.444
OTHERS I WOULD EXPECT THAT

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.012
WE'LL SEE AN INCREASE IN

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.981
POVERTY WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:50.982
TWENTY TWENTY OVERALL.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.317
ESPECIALLY WITHIN CERTAIN

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:53.518
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:56.154
COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED.

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:58.423
FOURTH AND FINALLY POLICY

00:30:58.489 --> 00:30:59.724
DECISIONS THIS YEAR WILL HAVE

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:01.292
MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR NEAR

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.261
TERM WELL BEING AND I HOPE ALSO

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.896
FOR LONG TERM WELL BEING. THE

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:06.831
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT SIGNED

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.233
BY PRESIDENT BY THEN EXTENDS

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.101
MANY PROVISIONS THEIR RESEARCH

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:12.103
BELIEVES WERE EFFECTIVE DURING

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.937
THE PAST YEAR AS I MENTIONED

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:15.006
EARLIER. IT ALSO EXPANDS

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:16.174
SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WITH

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.575
CHILDREN ON AND ON A GREAT NEW

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.711
SCALE THROUGH FULLY REFUNDABLE

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:21.579
TAX CREDITS. NATIONWIDE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:22.680
ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THIS

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.649
PACKAGE TOGETHER COULD CUT

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.951
CHILD POVERTY AND HALF. AN ARE

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.353
ROUGH ESTIMATES FROM THE

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:29.520
CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:31.689
SUGGESTS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER BUT

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.158
SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON IN THE

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:35.526
STATE FOR THOSE CHILD TAX

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:37.362
CREDITS ALONE. AND IF THEY'RE

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.197
EXTENDED BEYOND THIS YEAR IT

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.365
COULD REALLY BE A GAME CHANGER

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.567
FOR CHILD POVERTY. THERE IS

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:43.601
STRONG CONSENSUS IN THE

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.136
RESEARCH LITERATURE ABOUT LARGE

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.537
SCALE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.973
CASH AND CASH LIKE BENEFITS CAN

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.075
EFFECTIVELY REVERSE DETRIMENTAL

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.111
HEALTH EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:55.146
IMPACT OF MATERIAL NEED THAT

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.315
MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE. TWO

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.384
OBSERVATIONS MAY HELP I THINK

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.419
PUT THIS CHILD TAX CREDIT IN

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:02.987
PERSPECTIVE CONSIDERING THAT

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.555
YOU'RE HEARING IS TALKING ABOUT

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:05.890
OTHER PROGRAMS RELATED TO THAT

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:07.325
TODAY AND I'LL AND ON THIS

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:09.193
POINT. FIRST AS CURRENTLY

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.062
DESIGNED THESE TRACK CREDITS

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:12.530
ARE UNLIKELY TO DISCOURAGE

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.998
FAMILIES FROM WORKING A

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:17.702
COMMONLY. RAISED CONCERNS OR IN

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.437
MY VIEW NOT IN IN AGGREGATE OUT

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:21.139
WITH BENEFITS. SECOND TACK

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.107
CHILD TAX CREDITS ALONE WOULD

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:24.475
NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO KEEP CHILD

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:26.177
POVERTY AT BAY OR TO CUT IT IN

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:28.179
HALF AS ASTON THAT SUGGESTS. IT

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.614
MUST WORK TOGETHER WITH

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.982
CALFRESH CAL WORKS IN OTHER

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:33.117
EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ALL

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:35.019
TOGETHER AS A PACKAGE AT THE

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:35.553
SCALE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.689
TALKING ABOUT AND EFFECTIVELY

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.424
AND EQUITABLY REACH

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.792
CALIFORNIANS IN NEED. THANK YOU

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:07.752
INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY.

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.120
FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:10.855
WHILE CALIFORNIA IS A WEALTHY

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:13.324
ST HOME TO MANY HIGH INCOME

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:15.193
HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES THAT

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.527
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GREATLY

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:18.429
EXPANDS OUR WEALTH IN THE LAST

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:20.698
SEVERAL DECADES. BECAUSE OF

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.567
POLICY BARRIERS AND GENDER AND

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.669
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION MILLIONS

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.771
OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY MANY

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.073
CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR WOMEN AND

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.609
IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN BLOCKED

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.711
FROM ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.713
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THESE

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.548
CALIFORNIANS FACE ECONOMIC

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:39.851
HARDSHIP EARNING LOW WAGES THAT

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.652
SIMPLY DID NOT MEET THEIR BASIC

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:44.989
NEEDS. SECOND COBIT NINETEEN

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:46.991
TOOK THIS BAD SITUATION AND IT

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.926
MADE IT EVEN WORSE WIDENING

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:52.096
RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUITIES.

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.598
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.700
THE JOBS STILL GONE ARE IN

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:58.703
INDUSTRIES SUCH AS THE

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.605
PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN AND

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:01.906
IMMIGRANTS WERE

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.574
DISPROPORTIONATELY EMPLOYED.

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:06.310
LEADING THEM TO SEEK NOTABLY

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.312
HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS.

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.814
BECAUSE THESE INDUSTRIES WERE

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.749
MOSTLY LOW PAYING. THIS

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:14.185
RECESSION ALSO MEANS THAT MOST

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:14.986
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL OUT OF

00:34:15.052 --> 00:34:17.288
WORK WEREN'T EARNING MUCH

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:19.590
BEFORE THIS CRISIS AND ARE

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.325
UNLIKELY TO HAVE SAVINGS TO

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.594
FALL BACK ON IF THEY DON'T GET

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:26.030
ENOUGH PUBLIC SUPPORT BEFORE

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.099
THEY CAN FIND WORK AGAIN. THIS

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.168
WILL LIKELY BE A LONG TERM

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:32.470
CONCERN BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. AS

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.705
IT WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME TO

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.741
RECOVER ALL OF THE JOBS LOST.

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:38.476
LOST JOBS AND EARNINGS HAVE

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:40.044
STRETCHED CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:43.648
BUDGETS. INOUR STATE ALMOST

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:44.715
TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WITH

DURING A FOUR WEEK PERIOD I IN

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:55.593
LATE JUNE AND JULY. THIS

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.728
INCLUDES MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.030
WITH YOU NEXT HOUSEHOLDS AND

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.932
BLACK HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.433
ALSO REPORTING SOMETIMES OR

ESTARá BONE HAS ALREADY

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.513
HIGHLIGHTED WE STILL REQUIRE A

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.882
SAFETY NET THAT IS ACCESSIBLE

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.851
ROBUST AND THAT PROVIDE ON

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.519
GOING SUPPORT BEYOND THE

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:24.522
PANDEMIC. EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:26.224
BENEFITS IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.292
PLAN WILL EXPIRE IN EARLY

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:30.261
SEPTEMBER AND IT'S VERY

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.029
UNLIKELY THAT EVERYONE WHO'S

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:35.132
LOST JOBS WE'LL FIND WILL HAVE

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:38.402
FOUND EMPLOYMENT BY THEN. SO

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.137
SIMPLIFYING ACCESS TO THE

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:42.173
SAFETY NET NOW. BECAUSE FEDERAL

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.376
RELIEF COULD RUN OUT AT A TIME

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:45.943
WHEN MANY PEOPLE STILL NEED

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.646
HELP. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.348
PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:51.916
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE EXCLUDED

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.751
FROM FEDERAL SUPPORT DUE TO

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.820
THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. SUCH

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:57.321
AS THROUGH EXPANDING THE

PERHAPS ANOTHER GOLDEN STATE

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:07.398
STIMULUS. FINALLY AFTER THE

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.634
PANDEMIC WE SHOULD LOOK BEYOND

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.936
JUST RECOVERY TO CONSIDERING

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.571
HOW OUR SAFETY NET CAN BE

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:14.805
RESTRUCTURED TO MEET THE REAL

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:18.442

ALSO RECEIVE THE FULL CALFRESH

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:28.619
ALLOWANCE WOULD STILL LIVE

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:29.253
BELOW THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.522
PROPERTY. THIS IS CONSPICUOUSLY

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:33.424
CONCERNING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.793
THE FEDERAL DEFINITION DOES NOT

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.361
ACCOUNT FOR IT WILL REFLECT

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.696
CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER HOUSING

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:22.493
FOR QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TO

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.827
ADDRESS IS THIS ISSUE THAT

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.429
WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF DECLINE

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:29.733
IN THE- BURKE TOLD CASE- ALONG

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.636
WITH. TO REASON- FOR WHY WE'RE

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:34.438
SEEING OTHER NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:35.639
EXETER OUR PROGRAM AND WE

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.708
NORMALLY EXPERIENCE- IN TERMS

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:41.812
THE K. DECLINE DO US OF HONE IN

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:44.615
ON A FEW KEY EXAM- FOR INSTANCE

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:48.552
NEW OP. EYES DRY JOHN MEN- THE

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:51.588

ESSENTIALLY MADE MANY FAMILIES

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.091
AN ELIGIBLE FOR OUR PROGRAM

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:56.760
RIGHT AND SO THAT WAS A KEY

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:57.961
FACTOR POTENTIALLY IN MY NEW

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.763
APPLICANTS WERE UNABLE TO

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.999
ACCESS OUR PROGRAM IN ADDITION

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:02.933
TO THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.369
COMPENSATION. THE OTHER PIECE

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:08.806
IS THAT- IN SORT OF HEARING AND

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:09.339
CHECKING IN WITH OUR OTHER

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.841
STATE PARTNERS WE HAVE HEARD

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:14.144
AND LEARNED THAT- OTHERS. HAVE

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:16.413
EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SITUATIONS-

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.614
NOT ONLY ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.383
BUT ALSO ON THE TRIBAL TENNIS

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.085
SIDE- WHERE THEY'VE SEEN

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:23.487
SIMILAR DECLINES- IN COLORADO

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.622
AND MASSACHUSETTS THE RECENTLY

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.924
SHARED WITH US- THAT THEY SAW A

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.592
SIGNIFICANT DECLINE SIMILAR TO

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:29.660
WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.361
CALIFORNIA- BUT ON THE FLIP

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:32.996
SIDE WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:34.698
STATES SUCH AS NEVADA. THAT

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.067
HAVE GONE. THE OTHER DIRECTION

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.703
RIGHT- WHERE IN ABOUT IT THEY

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.973
HAVE EXCLUDED ALL- UNEMPLOYMENT

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.643
INCOME- FROM FROM ELIGIBILITY-

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.313
I WILL FLAG. THE AND INCOME IS

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:52.716
A FEDERAL INCOME. FOR TNF AND-

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:54.485
BUT THAT IS AT THE DISCRETION

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.520
OF STATES IN TERMS OF THE

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.822
TREATMENT- ANOTHER FACTOR THAT

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:01.291
WE HAVE LOOKED AT IS IN TERMS

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.926
OF THE ISSUE OF DISCONTINUING

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:06.463
SAYS- AS YOU MAY RECALL IN IN

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.831
THE AT THE ONSET OF THE

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:17.074
PANDEMIC. WE DID WAIVE- THE

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:19.209
PROCESSING OF WORKS DETERMINE-

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:19.776
DURING THE SPRING RIGHT AND

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.212
WHAT THAT CENTRAL DID A KICK

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.414
THE CAMP FOR- SERVERS. IN AN-

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.316
IN DISK. SAYS IN THE FALL OF

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:27.818
LAST YEAR AND SO- WHAT WE THE

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:30.154
DAY THOUGH IS THAT. THAT THREE

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.990
MY PEAK OF DE. IS THAT WE SAW

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.758
IN THE FALL. OUR DECEMBER DAY

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.094
SHOW THAT DISK. IS HAD ACTUALLY

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.128
DROPPED BY TO WHAT WE WERE.

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:41.498
SEEN ON WITH OUR CASE- SO.

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.100
THAT'S A TRYING TO SEE- IT

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:45.636
COULD BE SHOWING- THAT THERE IS

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:48.138
A NATURAL DECLINE IN PLACE LOAD

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:48.939
THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED-

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:51.375
PRETEND SOONER. WHAT THAT THREE

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.777
MONTHS OF DISCONTINUING IS- AND

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:56.246
POSITING THAT THIS R. SEVEN-

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:57.314
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.149
IMPORTANT PIECES THAT FAMILIES

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:00.517
WERE POTENTIALLY ABLE TO STAY

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.587
ON LONGER- AND THAT THE POLICY-

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.489
PUSHING OUT THAT DISCONTINUANCE

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.624
OF THE FALL WAS- RESULTED IN

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:08.759
AND NOT BENEFIT. AND SO THAT'S

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:12.930
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:15.566
HIGHLIGHT- ANOTHER PIECE THAT I

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.801
SAY THAT- DO CAN TO- WE OUR

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:20.137
TOWN WELFARE. WITH SOME. TO

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.172
REALLY LOOK AT LOOK AT THE DAY.

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.174
IN GREEDY. TO I DON'T ANY OTHER

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.743
P. CALL- ANY PREVENTATIVE

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.245
MEASURES THAT WE MAY TAKE TO

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:29.746
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.014
ELIGIBLE ARE CONTINUING T

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.050
RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS- WE

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:35.452
HAVE- AS YOU MAY RECALL IT IN

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.454
ANOTHER CONVERSATION. OUTLINED

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.456
A SERIES OF WEAVERS EVERY

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.258
IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.559
THE CLIENTS WERE ABLE TO KEEP

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.394
THEIR BENEFITS AND THAT. THEY

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:45.696
WERE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.130
HAVING TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.399
IN THE OFFICES- AND SO THAT WAS

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.802
CERTAINLY AYE AYE KEY FACTOR-

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.403
ANOTHER FLAG THAT I WOULD POINT

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.471
OUT THERE DIRECTOR JOHNSON

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.173
ALLUDED TO. IS THAT MOST

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.010
RECENTLY- WE HAVE AGAIN-

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.045
DISCONTINUE COUNTY INTO THE

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:02.879

COMPENSATION- FOR NEW

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:06.450
APPLICANTS AND THAT. IT'S TOO

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.418
EARLY TO TELL THE IMPACT- BUT

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:09.920
KNOWING THE IMPACT UNEMPLOYMENT

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.155
INCOME HAS HAD ON FOLKS- IT WE

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:13.690
SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.359
POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM THAT. ON

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.693
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.196
SAY IS WE HAVE STARTED TO WORK

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:22.399
ON IMPLEMENTATION. OF THAT THE

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.934
GOLDEN STATE GRANT AND SO OF

AGAIN HELP FAMILIES- DURING

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:33.543
THESE THESE CHALLENGING TIMES.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:34.144
MOVING ON TO OTHER PART THAT

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.513
WERE IN AGENDA- ANOTHER P. OF

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.814
ADVICE TO ADDRESS SORT OF HOW

BUILD OFF OF WHAT'S ALREADY

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:49.912
BEEN SAID INTERESTING QUESTION.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:54.350
UNDER WOULD LIKE TO. IT'S NOT

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.986
THE BIG PICTURE GENERALLY WHEN

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.355
WE SEE AN INCREASE IN

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.790
UNEMPLOYMENT AS WE DID LAST

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.726
SPRING WE SEE A NOTABLE AND

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.129
CONTINUED INCREASE IN CASE LOAD

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.296
FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.998
INCLUDING HEALTH QUESTION

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.500
CALPERS. THIS LAST YEAR HAS

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:18.574
BEEN IN THE- TO. BECAUSE OF HOW

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.743
IT WORKS IT'S BEEN MOVED SINCE

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:25.248
OUR SERVICE A FAMILY OF TWO

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:25.815
HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW INCOME

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.717
CHILDREN THAT IS BOTH THE

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.719
LOWEST CASELOAD NUMBER AND THE

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.387
HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM AND

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.856
REPRESENTS THE FASTEST DECLINE

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.258
IN CASE THOUGH THAT WE HAVE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.092
SEEN THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.528
PROGRAM IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.562
THOUSAND FEWER CHILDREN THAN WE

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:42.532
SERVED. A YEAR PRIOR TO THE

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:45.968
PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE NOW THE

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.904
QUESTION IS OF COURSE WHY ARE

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.073
WE SAYING KISSEL AND DECREASES

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:52.041
WHY IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT THAN

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.143
PREVIOUS RECESSIONS AND

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.711
GENERALLY WE THINK THAT THERE

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.848
ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF FACTORS

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.049
THAT GO INTO THAT. PRESS

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.852
FACTORS INTO THREE THE POCKETS.

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:03.886
ONE OF OUR THAT THE ECONOMIC

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.322
CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ARE

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.357
DIFFERENT OR MAYBE DIFFERENT.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:09.992
IN THIS CURRENT RECESSION FOR

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.395
EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT- IN THE

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.098
DATA. THAT WAY ELSE IN THIS

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.566
RECESSION OF DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.401
AFFECTED WORKERS WITHOUT

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:21.337
CHILDREN OR DIGITAL AND ARE NOT

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:21.804
ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.607
ASSISTANCE. ANOTHER BUCKET OF

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.442
REASONS IS THE ECONOMIC RELIEF

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.611
THAT HAS BEEN ALL. FOR IT BY

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.213
STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.582
THIS IS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED-

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.749
ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.485
INSURANCE IS HELP THEIR DIRECT

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:37.453
STIMULUS CHECKS ALSO EFFORTS

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.455
SUCH AS- THE INFECTION

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.090
MORATORIUM ALL OF THESE EFFORTS

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.693
MAY HAVE REDUCED DEMAND. FOR

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.328
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. ABOUT

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:48.064
FINAL REASON IS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.365
MEASURES AND CONCERNS

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.900
THEMSELVES I'M GONNA SPEND A

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.635
LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON THIS NOT

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.437
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.172
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR BUT

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:57.540
BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.442
IS A FACTOR SUGGEST SOME

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:03.579
POTENTIAL. POLICY OPTIONS FOR

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:04.180
THE LEGISLATURE. SO ONE THING

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.815
KNOW ABOUT PROGRAM SUCH AS CAL

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.750
WORKS IS THAT THEY TEND TO-

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.019
POSE A LARGE PAPERWORK BURDEN

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.421
ON APPLICANTS AND- EXISTING

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:15.091
RECIPIENTS- APPLICATIONS CAN BE

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:18.394
DIFFICULT. ONCE ENROLLED A

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:19.529
FAMILY HAS TO SAY

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.230
RECERTIFICATION PAPERWORK AT

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.533
LEAST EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND WE

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.500
KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:25.401
FRICTION OF BOTH OF THOSE

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.704
POINTS- SINCE THE PANDEMIC

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.640
WE'VE SEEN THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.441
DENIALS ON APPLICATIONS OF

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.477
INCREASED WITH THE MOST COMMON.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.013
REASON FOR DENIALS AND IT COULD

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.715
WORK ERRORS. WE HAVE SEEN AT

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:42.018
LEAST A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.819
CASES EXITING WITH THE MOST

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:47.623
COMMON REASON BEING CONNECTED

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.859
TO. RESEARCH PAVE IT BEING

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.827
EITHER INCOMPLETELY OR

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:54.297
INCORRECTLY FILLED OUT. WE ARE

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.432
ALSO SEE RYAN WE'RE HAVING SOME

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.401
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- WITH

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.670
YOUR FEET I MAY ASK YOU TO TURN

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.705
YOUR VIDEO OFF IF THAT'S OKAY

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.741
JUST SO THAT WE CAN- GET THE

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:09.679
INTEGRITY OF YOUR COMMENTS. OF

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.248
COURSE LET ME TRY THIS AUDIO

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:16.085
ONLY SEE IF THAT WORKS BETTER-

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:20.389
SO- SO- AS AS BEEN MENTIONED BY

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:22.858
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WHILE WE DID

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.961
SEE A TEMPORARY INCREASE AND

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:28.531
I'D CASES ACCIDENT- IN THE MOST

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.032
RECENT DATA IN DECEMBER WE DID

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:31.601
SEE THAT EXIT RATE COME DOWN

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.169
SOMEWHAT BUT ANOTHER THING THAT

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.204
WE SAW IN DECEMBER WAS THAT THE

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.939
NUMBER OF. GENES FOR

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:39.542
RESTORATION THESE ARE CASES OF

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.110
FAMILIES WHO WERE DISCONTINUED

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.279
IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.147
WERE ASKING TO BE REINSTATED

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.949
HAS ALSO INCREASED AND THAT'S

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.684
NOT AT HISTORIC HIGH THE

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:49.952
SUGGESTS THAT MANY OF THOSE

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.821
CASES THAT WERE DISCONTINUED IN

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:53.656
THE MONTHS WHEN THE CASE PHONE

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.791
WAS CASELOAD EXIT RATE WAS

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:59.128
HISTORICALLY HIGH WE'RE STILL

01:04:59.195 --> 01:04:59.962
FOLKS THAT. REQUIRED WILL. A

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.365
DESIRE ASSISTANCE IN SOME WAYS.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.100
WELL ALL OF THIS TO US SUGGEST

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:07.203
THAT THERE MAYBE- SOME FRICTION

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.638
IN TERMS OF COMPLETING

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.239
PAPERWORK AND ESPECIALLY IN

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:12.341
THIS CONDITION WHERE-

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.344
APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS. ARE

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.980
EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.482
COME TO A PHYSICAL COUNTY

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:21.617
OFFICE WHERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:24.387
TO RECEIVE STAFF ASSISTANCE IN

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.889
COMPLETING THESE PAPERWORK-

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.125
AGAIN WE EMPHASIZE THIS NOT

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.460
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS THE MAJOR

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.663
OR EVEN A MAJOR CONCERN BUT

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.464
BECAUSE AND SUGGEST SOME POLICY

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.233
OPTIONS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.868
PREVIOUSLY IN THE SPRING WE

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.236
TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED RE

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.504
DETERMINATIONS FOR THE COW

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.572
WORKS PROGRAM AND THIS RESULTED

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.574
IN A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN CASE

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.776
LOAD CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.111
WOULD EXPECT GIVEN THE STATE OF

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:51.247
THE ECONOMY AT THAT TIME. WELL

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.848
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN MADE

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:53.849
AWARE OF SOME TECHNICAL

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.518
DIFFICULTIES AND REINSTATING

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.853
THAT SUSPENSION WHAT WE THINK

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.854
THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE SOME

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:01.457
OPTIONS TO. AGAIN SUSPEND RE

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:05.161
DETERMINATIONS THROUGH THE LIFE

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:06.896
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:09.198
THE QUESTIONS. ASK ABOUT THE

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.433
AFFECT OF UNEMPLOYMENT

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:13.235
INSURANCE BENEFITS THIS HAS

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.036
BEEN ADDRESSED TO SOME EXTENT

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:17.973
BY. PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- WE WILL

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.711
NOT THAT- EVEN IN EIGHT

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.279
TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.613
INSURANCE BENEFIT WILL

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.582
TYPICALLY RENTER FAMILIES

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.451
INCOME AND ELIGIBLE FOR CAL

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.453
WORK SO THIS IS BEFORE ANY ADD

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.488
ONS THAT WERE INCLUDED. IN

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.124
RECENT FEDERAL MEASURES. ALSO

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.727
MANY CAL WORKS FAMILIESHAVE. A

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.128
TENUOUS CONNECTIONS TO LABOR

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.696
MARKET MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.164
UNEMPLOYED FOR A VERY LONG TIME

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:44.767
AND THOSE. ARE PROBABLY

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.469
UNLIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:47.970
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.071
THERE'S SOME REASON TO BELIEVE

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:52.441
THAT THIS WAS A FACTOR. YES LEE

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:54.176
AND SOME APPLICANTS BEING

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:57.213
DENIED AND- THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.048
RECENTLY AND IT'S EARLY ACTION

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.649
PACKAGE AND COVERT EXEMPTED

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:03.119
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THE

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.153
ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.921
INSURANCE FROM COUNTING AGAINST

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.524
INCOME ELIGIBILITY SO WE THINK

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.425
THAT WILL ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.761
THERE. FINALLY THE QUESTIONS

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:14.230
ASK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CASH-

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.365
I'LL SAY THAT SOME OF. MY

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.800
PREVIOUS COMMENTS APPLY TO THE

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.101
CONFERENCE CASELOAD WE HAVE

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.704
SEEN A DECLINE SINCE AS THE

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.740
DIRECTOR NOTED WE DID SEE. I.

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:27.877
P. N. CALFRESH CASELOAD- EARLY

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:31.414
LAST SUMMER. WE'VE SINCE SEEN A

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.782
DECLINE. THE CASE HOWEVER ABOVE

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:35.785
ITS PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL AND- AS

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:36.886
HAS BEEN NOTED THERE'S BEEN

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.421
SOME CHANGES ON THE FEDERAL

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.990
SIDE WHICH WE REASONABLY EXPECT

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:44.026
WILL RESULT IN. A CASELOAD

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.995
INCREASES DOWN THE LINE. AND

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.029
THE OTHER THING ABOUT HOW FRESH

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:49.265
IS THAT MOST OF THE RELEVANT

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.499
POLICY SET AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.568
SO LEGISLATORS DISCRETION THERE

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.171
IS A LOT MORE DETAILED THAN IT

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.973
IS FOR OUR X. I BELIEVE THAT

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.941
ADDRESSES THE QUESTIONS OVER

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:01.043
PERFORMANCE. THANK YOU. THANK

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.646
YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:06.015
JACKIE BOTTLE SO YOU'LL-

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:10.686
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.555
HI JACKIE BUT ON ZERO FROM THE

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:15.458
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE-

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.725
STARTING OFF WITH THE FIRST

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.594
QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA-

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:21.130
BETWEENFEDERAL FISCAL YEAR

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:21.697
TWENTY NINETEEN AND FEDERAL

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.299
FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.234
TRANSPORT CASELOAD HAS DECLINED

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.571
STATEWIDE BY 4% FROM ONE POINT

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.739
ONE THREE MILLION TO ONE POINT

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:32.174
ZERO NINE MILLION AND THIS IS

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.843
LIKELY DUE TO DECLINING

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.144
CASELOAD IN CAL WORKS WHICH

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.679
SERVES AS THE PRIMARY CASELOAD

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.781
PIPELINE INTO THE CHILD SUPPORT

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.883
PROGRAM. DESPITE THE DECLINING

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.184
CASELOAD COLLECTIONS OF

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.653
ACTUALLY SPIKED FROM TWO POINT

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.988
FIVE BILLION TO TWO POINT EIGHT

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.923
MILLION OVER THE SAME TIME

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:49.458
PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS A 12%

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.160
INCREASE. IT IS OUR

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.995
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SPIKE IS

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:55.097
LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:56.765
INTERCEPTIONS OF KERR'S ACT

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.634
FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.269
THE INTERCEPTION UP BASE

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.638
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. DIES WE

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:03.973
WOULD NOTE THAT THIS COLLECTION

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:07.076
SPIKE IS LIKELY NOT INDICATIVE

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.944
OF BASELINE PROGRAM TRENDS.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:09.778
MOVING ON TO THE SECOND

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.580
QUESTION REGARDING OUR

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.381
ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSED

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.017
STUDIES. ON THE COMPROMISE OF A

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.785
RICH PROGRAM AND THE K. FACTOR

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.187
WHICH IS THE SHARE OF INCOME

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:20.523
FAMILY SPENT ON CHILDREN- WE

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.091
FOUND THAT THERE ALREADY ARE

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.926
EXISTING STUDIES BUT THE STATE

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.128
COULD PULL FROM. TO INFORM

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.030
POSSIBLE PROGRAM CHANGES FOR

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.698
EXAMPLE A NUMBER OF STUDIES

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.966
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OVER THE

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:33.302
PAST TEN YEARS SOME AT THE

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.638
REQUEST OF THE STATE AN EFFORT

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.740
TO UPDATE THE K. FACTOR. THE

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:40.075
MOST- RECENT STATE REPORT ON

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.544
THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINE

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.479
NOTED THAT THE REASON WHY THE

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.447
STUDIES MAY NOT HAVE RESULTED

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.583
IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IS

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.418
BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:50.152
COMPARE THE STRENGTHS AND

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.121
WEAKNESSES OF EACH STUDY IT MAY

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.822
BE DIFFICULT TO SELECT ONE

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.959
STUDY OVER THE OTHER. BUT ALSO-

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:57.893
THERE THERE ARE PROCEEDS

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.628
CHALLENGES OF KEEPING POLITICS

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.764
OUT OF THE ULTIMATE DECISION

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.766
WITH THAT SAID WE SUGGEST THAT

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:04.833
THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.669
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON.

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.337
THESE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:10.039
STRUCTURES OF THE STUDIES TO

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.607
ENSURE THAT ONE THEY'RE NOT

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:13.876
DUPLICATIVE OF PAST RESEARCH

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.611
AND TO THEY ACTUALLY WILL HELP

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:19.982
OVERCOME THE BARRIERS. THAT

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.016
HAVE PREVENTED CHANGES THUS FAR.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.918
WHAT THAT SAID- WE ALSO

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.553
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.689
CONSIDER WAYS TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:28.857
INFORMATION- THAT CAN COME FROM

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.893
THE STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.528
LEGISLATURE COULD REACH REQUEST

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.530
THAT THE COLLECTABILITY STE-

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.031
STUDY ASSESSED AND EQUITABLE

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.499
EFFECTIVE DATE ON CERTAIN

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.401
SUBGROUPS LIKE RACIAL

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.503
MINORITIES. AND BE PERSON

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.539
CENTERED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.007
ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.775
MAY REQUEST THAT THE STUDY

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:47.876
ASSESS THE BENEFITS AND TRADE

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:50.846
OFFS- I'M SPECIFIC POLICY

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.448
INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS NOT

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:53.515
COLLECTING INTEREST ON

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:56.652
GOVERNMENT OWED ARREARS- OR

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.287
ENDING ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.089
CASES DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:01.624
WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN PAST

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:05.294
LEGISLATIVE BILLS. THAT WERE

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:05.794
ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.496
GOVERNOR. I'M IN THE

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.764
LEGISLATURE JUST MAY WANT TO

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.333
KEEP IN MIND- HOW ANY ADDITIONS

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.568
OR CHANGES TO THESE STUDIES

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.203
JUST MAY IMPACT THE TIMING OF

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:17.406
THE STUDIES AS WELL- BUT IF THE

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.942
RESEARCH PROPOSAL I'M- AS THE

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.343
DEPARTMENT MENTIONED CANNOT BE

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.812
PROVIDED UNTIL THE END OF THE

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.881
SOLICITATION PROCESS. THEN THE

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.883
LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT HOW

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.352
CURRENT PROGRAM UPDATES- THAT

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.522
ARE BEING PROVIDED- AS A RESULT

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:35.891
OF SRL PASSED LAST YEAR COULD

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.060
SERVE AS A VEHICLE FOR CHECK

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.796
INS- WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.364
BOTH GO OVER THE RESEARCH

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:45.167
DESIGN AND SOLICIT LEGISLATIVE

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.802
AND PART FOR THOSE STUDIES.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:47.803
MOVING ON TO THE THIRD

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.140
QUESTION- I WOULD FLAG THAT AS

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.307
WRITTEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.542
FINAL FINAL RULE THE STATE WAS

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:54.576
ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET AN

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.378
EXTENSION FOR COMPLYING WITH

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.012
THE FINAL FINAL RULE

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.914
REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CHILD

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.149
SUPPORT GUIDELINES AND THE

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:01.417
ESTABLISHMENT OF SUPPORT

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:04.053
OBLIGATIONS- AND THAT EXTENSION

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.689
IS. TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.389
FOUR SO THIS MEANS THAT THE

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:08.991
STATE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.559
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.162
WITH MAJOR REMAINING COMPONENTS

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.563
OF THE FEDERAL FINAL ROLES SUCH

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.331
AS- CONSIDERING BASIC

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.400
SUBSISTENCE NEEDS OF THE PAYING

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.536
PARENT WHEN ESTABLISHING. CHILD

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:23.238
SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS OR COMING

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.673
UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:25.808
CURRENT PRESUMED INCOME

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.610
PRACTICE AND POSSIBLY EXPANDING

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.913
CASE CLOSURE CRITERIA. AGAIN

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.815
THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.850
HOW TO LEVERAGE THE CURRENTLY

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:39.121
SCHEDULED SRL MEETINGS I'M TO

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.422
AT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.924
KEEP THE LEGISLATURE UP TO DATE

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.759
ON PROGRESS MADE SO FAR BUT

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.594
THEN ALSO OPPORTUNITIES IN

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.996
WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.131
COMPLETE CAN PROVIDE IMPACT.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.766
AND WE WOULD ALSO FLAG THAT

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.167
WHEN THE STATE IS IN THE

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:54.069
POSITION TO ADOPT CHANGES

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.537
RELATED TO THE FINAL FINAL RULE

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:56.805
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:57.906
CONSIDER THE BENEFITS AND

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:59.475
TRADEOFFS. OF MAKING

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:02.611
SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM CHANGES I'M

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:03.145
THROUGH REGULATIONS VERSUS

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.647
STATUTE. AS FOR THE LAST

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.850
QUESTION BESIDES WHAT WE HAVE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.018
ALREADY FLAGGED- RELATED TO THE

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.487
STUDIES AND THE FINAL FINAL

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:03.939
FIRST QUESTION ON THE AGENDA IS

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:06.241
RELATED TO- KELLY'S PERSPECTIVE

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.010
ON THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE AND

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:08.977

IN THE PROGRAM. AS YOU HEARD-

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.186

THE DECLINE SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.523
ALIGNED WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:22.925
HOWEVER WE'VE SEEN AND EVEN

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.526
MORE RAPID DECLINE IN THE PAST

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.295
NINE MONTHS. THEY CAN'T FUNDING

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.530
INCREASES GENERALLY COINCIDED

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:29.431
WITH THE REDETERMINATION

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.233
PROCESS THESE THAT WERE

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.601
INITIALLY POSTPONED FOR SIX

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.336
MONTHS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:35.571
REDETERMINATION TYPICALLY

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:36.839
HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME EVERY

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.707
YEAR SO AS WE TALK WITH

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.475
COUNTIES ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THE

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.777
FACT THAT THESE READERS

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.812
TERMINATIONS WERE DELAYED BY

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:44.479
SIX MONTHS. RATHER THAN AN

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.148
ENTIRE YEAR LIKELY CAUSE

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.649
CONFUSION FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:49.384

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.019
WORK AND REQUIREMENTS TO OCCUR

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:53.455
WHEN THEY GET. AS A RESULT MANY

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.022
PEOPLE DID NOT COMPLETE THE

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:56.158
REDETERMINATION. AND AS YOU

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.693
HEARD THE BIGGEST REASON FOR

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:58.894
DENIALS IS ALSO DUE TO

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.128
PAPERWORK WHICH SPEAKS OF THE

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:04.199

GOING THESE PROCESSES AND

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:09.471
ALREADY OVERWHELMING TIME.

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:10.172
IMPORTANTLY YOU WHEN SOMEONE

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:17.980
WITH THE NECESSARY PAPERWORK.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.348
THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO REAPPLY

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.416
ALL OVER AGAIN. UNLIKE WITH

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:22.951
MEDI CAL WHERE SOMEONE CAN COME

THEY BRING THE INFORMATION BACK

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:32.327

PERIOD AND THE CALYX PROGRAM.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.499
AND THE APPLICANT RULES ARE

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.434
MORE STRICT THAN THE RECIPIENT

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.036
ROLES. IN PARTICULAR ARE A

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.771

AT A VERY LOW LEVEL THAT HAS

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.586
NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:01.123

CALLER KERR GRAHAM WAS AN ACT

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.824
THAT. WE HAVE LONG SEEN A TURN

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.326
OF THE CASELOADS COST MEDIC CAL

THEY CAN BE SIMPLIFIED TO MAKE

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.743
IT LESS ONEROUS FOR CLIENTS.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:22.878
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT COULD

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:23.445
BE DONE TO HELP ADDRESS THE

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:25.681
SITUATION. WE RECOMMEND

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.449
POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.116

BE WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS.

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.496
YOU CAN ALSO POTENTIALLY DO

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:42.397
THIS VIA CAL FRESH WITH

POTENTIALLY ON SOME TECHNICAL

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.442
ISSUES TO WORK OUT BUT WE FEEL

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:54.743
IT'S WORTH DISCUSSING GIVEN HOW

OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.757
GIVEN THE CASE LAW DECLINES

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.125
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.393

RULES WHICH ARE CONFUSING. AND

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:05.600
DO NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR

YEAR- WHAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.468
THE COMMITTEE'S FOCUS TODAY ON

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.336
HOW THE STATE CAN MAKE OUR

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.338
PROGRAMS MORE RESPONSIVE-

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.440
DURING BAD ECONOMIC TIMES I

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:52.974
THINK ALL OF US HAVE BEEN

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.576
REALLY CONCERNED WITH- THE

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.977
DECLINES IN THE CASELOADS THAT

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.646
WE'VE BEEN SEEN. I WOULD NOTE

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.514
CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN FOR HAVING

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:00.415
ONE OF THE STRONGEST HANNAH

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.550
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY WE

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.252
PROVIDE YOU KNOW RELATIVELY

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.154
HIGH BENEFIT AMOUNTS NOT ENOUGH

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.856
BUT WE ALSO HAVE RELATIVELY

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.224
HIGH LEVEL OF THOSE WILL

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.259
FAMILIES PARTICIPATING AND WE

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.761
PROVIDE A PRETTY WIDE VARIETY

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.296
OF WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:16.064
IN OPTIONS AND WE PROVIDE

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.432
SUPPORT OF SERVICES LIKE

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:19.000
CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.403
DIAPERS AND OTHER ANCILLARY

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.171
BENEFITS THAT FAMILIES NEED IN

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:25.874
ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE- BUT

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.176
HAVING SAID THAT. OURS IS ALSO

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.178
A LEGACY OF THE PAST THIS

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.413
PROGRAM OF ALL FROM THE

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.148
PREVIOUS AID TO FAMILIES WITH

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:34.649
DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM M.

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.819
AND CAL WORKS WAS ADOPTED IN

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:38.320
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:40.388
UTILIZING MANY OF THE OLD FTC

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.324
ELIGIBILITY RULES LIKE THE IN

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.626
IN THE SACK INCOME TEST THE

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:49.864
HUNDRED OUR RULE AND. THE

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:50.465
DEPRIVATION REQUIREMENTS. FOR

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.200
OF MANY WE- TO USE QUARTERLY

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:55.203
REPORT IN OF NUMBERS. RESULTED

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.439
IN HIGH LEVELS OF CHURN FOR THE

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.040
PROGRAM AND WE WERE MAINTAIN

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.543
HARSH OVER PAYMENT RULES. BUT

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.978
ON TOP OF ALL THAT. WE DID

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.413
MANAGE CANNOT MANDATED

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.148
REQUIREMENTS LIKE WORK

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:11.519
REQUIREMENTS SANCTIONS AND TIME

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:12.420
LIMITS ON EIGHT FOR ADULTS.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.156
MOST PROBLEMATIC WAS THE PUBLIC

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:15.623
MESSAGING ABOUT CASH

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.592
ASSISTANCE. IN WHICH THE

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.928
PRESIDENT DECLARED THE END OF

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:22.630
WELFARE AS WE KNOW IT. SO WE

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.199
WERE SENDING OUT A LOT OF

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.301
MESSAGES ABOUT THIS PROGRAM TO

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.370
THE PUBLIC IN ABOUT ITS-

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.405
WORTHINESS AND ALL OF THIS I

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:32.741
THINK HAD UNPACKED ON CASELOADS

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.609
EVEN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.111
POWER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.279
EIGHT. WE HAD SEEN LARGE DROPS

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.849
IN THE CASELOAD AND EXCEPT FOR

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:42.917
ONE BRIEF SPIKE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:45.387
NINE AND TEN. THE STORY OF

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:48.289
POWER HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.959
DECLINING CASELOADS. SOME SEE

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:53.128
THIS IS A SIGN OF SUCCESS BUT

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.829
ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.698
THAT WE HAVE BUILT A PROGRAM

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.266
THAT'S MORE FOCUSED ON DENYING

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:01.403
ELIGIBILITY AND ONE INTENDED TO

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.638
HELP PEOPLE LEAVE POVERTY. ONE

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.006
ONLY NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.574
DESPITE AN INCREASE IN THE

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.810
NUMBER OF POOR FAMILIES IN

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.012
CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.180
NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE THE LOWEST

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.416
CASELOAD EVER. THAT'S NOT AN

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:16.551
ACCIDENT BUT PERHAPS AN

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:18.386
INTENTIONAL OUTCOME WE

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:19.921
ATTRIBUTE MUCH OF THIS TO THE

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:22.557
SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WE ERECTED

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.926
TO GETTING ON AND STAYING ON

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:27.128
ASSISTANCE. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.830
THAT HANNAH THE PROGRAM ITSELF

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.699
THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. IS PARTLY

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:33.735
TO BLAME IT'S BORN OUT OF A OUT

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:36.371
OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND INCLUDES

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.440
A HARSH COMPLAINTS NATURE TO

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:39.841
THE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK IS

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:40.975
REALLY DRIVEN MANY FAMILIES

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.544
AWAY. I DON'T SEE IT AS

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.412
SOMETHING AFFECTED FOR THEM TO

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:46.414
BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF POVERTY

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.284
QUICKLY. SO YOU DON'T HAVE

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.685
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LATER ON

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.187
THE AGENDA TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:53.221
I DID WANT OUTLINED A FEW

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:55.056
THINGS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND.

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.458
THAT THE LEGISLATURE LOOK AT

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:59.260
AND CONSIDER- GIVEN THESE.

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.695
RATHER ALARMING DROPS IN THE

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:04.299
CASELOAD. ONE IS REALLY SURE-

01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:05.633
WE AGREE WITH THE COUNTY

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.001
WELFARE DIRECTORS WE THINK WE

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:10.338
SHOULD. MAKE THE INCOME. EXCUSE

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:12.440
ME THE APPLICANT INCOME TEST TO

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:15.643
BE THE SAME AS THE CURRENT-

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.279
PARTICIPANT INCOME TEST. ON WE

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:19.380
ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S AN

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:20.748
ARGUMENT THAT IT OUGHT TO GO

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.517
EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT. WE ALSO

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.585
THINK WE NEED TO EXAMINE SOME

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.119
OF THESE ARCHAIC RULES LIKE THE

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.387
ON THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:29.591
ENROLLMENT APPROBATION RULE-

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.526
THERE REALLY ONLY DESIGNED TO

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:35.063
REDUCE CASELOADS. AND NOT

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:35.563
REALLY THEY DON'T REALLY

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:39.567
PROVIDE. A POLICY BENEFIT. WE

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.436
ALSO WOULD. AGREE THIRTY WELL

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:43.137
FOR DIRECTORS THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.873
REALLY MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM.

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.641
AND REDUCE THE DOCUMENTATION

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.610
THE VERIFICATIONS IN THE OFFICE

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.278
VISITS NEEDED TO BECOME

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:52.580
ELIGIBLE. AS WE SEEM DURING THE

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.581
PANDEMIC WHEN THE GOVERNOR

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:54.949
SUSPENDED MANY OF THESE

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:57.352
REQUIREMENTS THE INTEGRITY OF

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.320
THE PROGRAM DID NOT SUFFER. IN

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.389
FACT DOING SO- WE THINK

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:03.157
ACTUALLY IS THE WAVE OF THE

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:05.693
FUTURE. IT ALSO HAS THE EFFECT

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.896
OF FREEING UP COUNTY STAFF TIME

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:09.597
TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS MORE ON

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.867
HELPING FAMILIES SUCCEED. AND

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:16.271
FOCUS LESS ON COMPLIANCE WITH

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.540
THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. ONE

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:19.941
WE ALSO REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.142
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.211
RAISING THE INCOME EXACT

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.013
THRESHOLD. AND LOSE OUR

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:26.347
ATTACHMENT TO THE FEDERAL

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:27.815
POVERTY LINE. NOW THE

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:29.884
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.319
AND THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:32.554
BEEN MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.722
IN RECENT YEARS BY INCREASING

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.090
GRANTS IN THE EARNED INCOME

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.359
DISREGARD. BUT EVEN WITH THOSE

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:41.229
CHANGES A FAMILY EXIT HOURS

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:43.464
WHEN THEIR INCOME IS JUST TWO

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:44.165
THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOVE THE

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:45.767
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FEDERAL

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:50.805
POVERTY. LEVEL AND THEY NOT

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.574
ONLY YOU LOSE THEIR POWER AT

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.775
THAT POINT BUT EVENTUALLY

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.242
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:55.043
POTENTIALLY CHILD CARE AND ALSO

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:56.744
SOME OF SIR. THEY COULD GO WITH.

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:58.780
SO WE REALLY THINK THAT WE

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.515
SHOULD WE SHOULD EXTEND THE

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:02.483
EXIT POINT FOR POWER AND

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:03.952
PERHAPS LOOK TO DEVELOP A

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.320
BETTER MEASURE THAT WOULD

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:07.155
ACTUALLY MEASURE. WHEN A FAMILY

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.723
IS ABLE TO GO OFF PUBLIC

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.225
ASSISTANCE- WE HAVE THINGS LIKE

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.027
THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.796
OR PERHAPS WE NEED TO EVEN

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.264
THINK ABOUT DEVELOPING A METRIC

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.732
LIKE ELDER ECONOMIC SECURITY

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:21.769
INDEX. WHICH REALLY I THINK.

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.705
DOES A FAR BETTER JOB IN

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.373
ESTIMATING THE TRUE COST OF

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.708
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.543
FAMILIES AND SINCE WE KNOW THAT

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.244
WE HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THESE

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.647
HOUSEHOLDS. WHOSE DEVELOPMENT

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.749
REALLY DEPENDS ON US BEING ABLE

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.317
TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:38.186
STRESS THAT THEY LIVE WITH. WE

01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:39.587
THINK TRYING TO RAISE THESE

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.322
LEVELS UP WOULD BE A REALLY

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.257
CRUCIAL STEP TOWARD COMING AND

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.592
IT WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:45.994
TO COME INTO THE PROGRAM AND

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.162
STAY ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

MANY OF YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.352
EYES BUT- THANKS TO WORK BY THE

01:30:58.419 --> 01:30:59.554
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.622

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:02.557
ACTUALLY HAVE MORE DATA THAN

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:03.925

SO HELPFUL TO STATE

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.060
POLICYMAKERS. SO IF YOU CAN

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.462
BELIEVE IT- THE BEST ESTIMATE

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.031
WAS THAT- FOOD BANKS WERE

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:12.767
SERVING. APPROXIMATELY ONE

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.635
MILLION PER WEEK BECAUSE OF IT-

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:15.703
IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:16.938
THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE NUMBER OF

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.506
PEOPLE SEARCH PER WEEK AND SO

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:19.841
IT'S A HOUSEHOLD WENT TWICE TO

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.042
GET COUNTED TWICE IN THIS IS

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.176
THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.845
PEOPLE. OR THE DUPLICATED COUNT

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.847
INCLUDING SPEAK- SO WE WENT

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.448
FROM ONE MILLION PRIOR TO

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.616
BECAUSE OF IT INST ALMOST

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.318
INSTANTLY TO THREE MILLION AND

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:32.420
THE NEARLY FIVE MILLION- BUT WE

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.354
SAW IT AT THE END OF YEARS

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.456
ACTUALLY STABILIZED AT ABOUT

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.724
TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. I'M IN

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.025
FACT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:39.694
UNDER REPRESENTATION HERE

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.928
BECAUSE AS WE BANKS GOT INTO

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.096
THE BUSY HOLIDAY SEASON THERE

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.231
WERE SOME REPORTING SO WE

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.599
ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN THE NUMBER

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:45.399
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.968
NOVEMBER. IMAGINE THE SAME

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.503
THING FOR DECEMBER- ACT DURING

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.038
THAT TIME IT'S NOT REALLY

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.707
SPEAKS TO AS AS TRUCKING

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:53.908
JOHNSON SPOKE TO EARLIER JUST A

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.777
MOMENT OF NEED FOR FOOD ON

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.479
WHICH- AS YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.815
SUPPORTS. THANKFULLY ROSE

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:06.020
SUBSTANTIALLY. THROUGH THE

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:07.855
SUMMER. I THE TO GO AND SEE

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.323
COMING EARLY. AND THAT. THE

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.725
MAJOR BY. IN THE- WEST PLAN ARE

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.059
STILL LOOKING AT A FIVE. FOOD

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.127
OF NASH MORE THAN A BILLION.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.796
DOWN FROM THREE TWENTY TWENTY-

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:18.132
AND SO THAT DOES WE CONTINUE TO

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.567
ASK FROM CONGRESS OBVIOUSLY BUT

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:22.436
THAT IS THE CASE- FOR- BUT

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:24.038
WE'RE SEEING. THE SAME DEMAND

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:24.906
AT THE TO OUR PERCENT LEVEL BUT

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.407
WE'RE SEEING A POTENTIAL DROP

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.376
OFF AND FEDERAL FOOD- PUTS THE

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:30.177
FOCUS ON AS WAS SAID EARLIER OF

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:31.245
THE STATE'S ABILITY TO CLOSE

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:32.947
GAPS IN THE FOOD SAFETY NET.

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.549
OTHER PROGRAMS. I JUST HOPE

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.518
THAT- YOU KNOW ALL STAKEHOLDERS

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.953
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS TO THE

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.354
LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR. I

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.256
FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:43.791
THIS PROGRAM IS AND I REALLY

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:45.026
THINK DIRECTOR JOHNSON FOR HER

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.394
COMMENTS. WE'RE SEEING SOME

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.496
PICTURES ACTUALLY OF THE FOOD-

THAT IS SUPPORTING AT THE AT

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:17.257
BILLETE KIND OF BEHIND THE

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:18.491
SCENES IN THE BACKGROUND USING

OBTAIN THAT THE INCOME UPDATES

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:31.905
OTHER OTHER VERIFICATIONS ARE

01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:33.306
IN THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM KINGS

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.308
OUT OF THAT BUT THE BURDEN IS

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:36.810
LESSENED ON BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL

THE NILES AGAIN IT'S SOME OF

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.322
THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THAT

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.657
THEN MADE. MAKE THEM TO BE

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:52.592
JEWEL'S INELIGIBLE BUT I DEFER

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:53.526
TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE DEPUTY

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:58.732
DIRECTOR. AT HERNANDEZ THAT

01:48:58.798 --> 01:48:59.766
SHE'D LIKE TO ADD MORE. THE

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:00.934
ONLY OTHER ADDITION I WOULD

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.769
MAKE IS WHAT JENNIFER CRAPPIE

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:05.372
ALLUDED TO EARLIER- AROUND THIS

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:06.006
THE MESSAGING

01:49:06.072 --> 01:49:08.241
COMMUNICATION- WE HAVE BEEN

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.043
WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.845
ENSURE THAT. IF FOR SOME REASON

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.179
FOLKS WERE DENIED THAT THEY

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:14.214
KNOW THAT THEY COULD

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:15.682
POTENTIALLY APPLY AT A LATER

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:17.384
DATE RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.718
OF CONFUSION WITH A LOT OF THE

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:20.086
OTHER. PANDEMIC RELATED

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:21.655
ASSISTANCE- THAT MAY HAVE

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:23.523
DEEMED FOLKS INELIGIBLE AND SO

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:24.491
BEING ABLE TO ADD TO

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:25.792
PROACTIVELY ENGAGE THEM THROUGH

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:26.927
THAT COMMUNICATION IS GONNA BE

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.795
REALLY CRITICAL MOVING FORWARD.

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:31.865
SO ALONG THOSE LINES- WE SPEND

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.099
A LOT OF OUR TIME IN THIS

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.000
COMMITTEE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:36.469
MEDIKAL I'M- WONDERING WHETHER

01:49:36.536 --> 01:49:37.704
OR NOT WE CAN SUSPEND RE

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.239
DETERMINATIONS THROUGH THE

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.974
DURATION OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.743
EMERGENCY AS- WE HAVE DONE WITH

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:51.551
THE MEDICAL. YES I BEGIN WE ARE

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:54.054
LOOKING TO PROVIDE AS MUCH

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.422
PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY AS WE

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:56.690
CANNOT CROSS ALL OF OUR

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.858
PROGRAMS HERE SO. OUT FOR THE%

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:00.794
PURPOSES OF WHAT WE'VE

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.662
IMPLEMENTED TO DATE WE ARE.

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:05.432
PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:06.766
AFTER THAT TO THE EMERGENCY.

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.168
NEXT QUESTION IF I COULD IS

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:10.236
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT C. W. D.

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:12.339
A. HAD COMMENTED ON REGARDING

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:16.076
THE GRACE PERIOD- I WAS HOPING

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:18.178
YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT TEND

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:27.921
TO THE COMPARISONS WITH MEDICAL.

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:29.823
DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND AN INDUSTRY

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:32.959
WANT TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION.

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:34.694
I APOLOGIZE COULD YOU REPEAT

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:35.228
THE QUESTION I WAS HAVING

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:37.897
TROUBLE HEARING C. W. D. A. HAD

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:40.767
COMMENTED THAT THERE WAS A

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:42.035
GRACE PERIOD FOR A RE

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:43.536
DETERMINATIONS THAT HAD NOT

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:44.804
SUBMITTED THE APPROPRIATE

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:47.173
PAPERWORK AND THAT. ON MEDICARE

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.342
ALL WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN BACK

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:50.710
TO BEING BACK ON MEDIC CAL

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:52.445
WHILE ON CAL WORKS WE HAD TO

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:54.481
REAPPLY AND WAS WONDERING WHY

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.483
THERE WAS NOT A GRACE PERIOD

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:59.953
WITH AND CAL WORKS. SO THIS IS

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:03.757
A CHALLENGING ONE- SO- THE

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.625
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.293
FEDERALLY MANDATED AND THEY ARE

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.628
CLOSELY ALIGNED BETWEEN CAL

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.330
WORKS AND CALFRESH AND SO IT'S

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:12.165
REALLY PROBLEMATIC TO BE ABLE

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:14.334
TO APPLY FLEXIBILITIES TO ONE

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:16.202
PROGRAM AND NOT THE OTHER AND

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.504
SO WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:20.573
IMPLEMENT- THE REDETERMINATION-

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.509
PERIOD HERE FOR KICKING THE CAN

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:24.511
FORWARD IF YOU WILL- WE DID IT

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:26.279
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.781
FOR BOTH PROGRAMS. I'M SO

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.049
SEPARATING THAT OUT IS

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:32.352
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE- GIVEN HOW

01:51:32.419 --> 01:51:36.189
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT-OUR AUTOMATION SYSTEM- TO

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.657
CLOSELY ALIGN INTERCONVERT

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:38.858
THOSE THOSE POLICY ALIGNMENT

01:51:38.925 --> 01:51:41.628
AND AGAIN A LOT OF THAT IS

01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:44.330
FEDERALLY DRIVEN- I. THOUGHT

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:46.299
YOUR COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT HOW

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.867
THE REGION TERMINATIONS ALLOWED

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:49.436
US TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:51.471
ROAD BUT THAT THE BENEFIT IS

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.506
FAMILIES CAN STAY ON LONGER.

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.774
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:57.077
FAMILY STAY ON LONGER IF WE

01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:59.012
CANNOT END THUS THE REASONING

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.413
WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT RE

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.148
DETERMINATIONS. THROUGHOUT THE

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:03.349
REMAINDER OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:05.185
EMERGENCY I. FEEL LIKE I'VE

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.553
MADE MY POINT THE ONES WHO

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.988
WOULD LIKE TO- NOW MOVE ON TO A

01:52:09.055 --> 01:52:11.091
QUESTION IF I CAN REGARDING THE

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:13.493
ONE POINT 5% THAT SOME COUNTIES

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.596
ARE RECEIVING- WITHIN CAL WORKS

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:18.832
AND- WHETHER OR NOT THAT.

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:20.700
EQUITABLE IS THAT. AN

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:23.269
APPROPRIATE WAY FOR US TO BE

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:34.380
DISTRIBUTING THESE RESOURCES.

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:36.416
AGAIN DEFERRED TO. DEPUTY

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:38.184
DIRECTOR HAND ANDERSON ON THAT

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:48.761
QUESTION THANK YOU. I'M NOT

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:49.929
SURE THAT I AND I CLEARLY

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.164
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:54.434
APOLOGIES- I'M- ON PAGE

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:59.506
NINETEEN OF THE AGENDA IS A-

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:01.040
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.942
ONE POINT 5% INCREASE TO CAL

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.410
ARTS GRANTS FOR CERTAIN

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:06.312
COUNTIES THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:09.315
ON THE COAST. AND I'M WONDERING

01:53:09.382 --> 01:53:10.450
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.919
EQUITABLE WAY AND CONSISTENT

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:16.089
WAY THAT WE HAVE- APPLIED-

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:18.691
INCREASES TILL CAL WORKS GRANTS

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:25.265
OR OTHER PROGRAMS. OKAY NOW I

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:26.599
AM TRACKING APOLOGIES FOR THAT

01:53:26.666 --> 01:53:30.336
THANK YOU- SO PART OF WHAT THIS

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.505
DOES IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:34.507
LOWER COST COUNTIES AND THE

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:36.476
COASTAL COUNTIES. AND SO REALLY

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.978
IT IS LOOKING AT THOSE AREAS

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:41.948
THAT HAVE A- UNFORTUNATELY-

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:43.950
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER-

01:53:44.017 --> 01:53:45.752
HIGHER COST OF LIVING RIGHT AND

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:48.254
SO- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.355
LOOKING AT THE CHART THAT IT'S

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:51.624
ON PAGE NINETEEN I BELIEVE THAT

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:54.260
THAT IS WHAT IT'S REFERENCING.

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:56.930
I AM HAPPY TO HELP US FOLLOW UP

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.531
IN A CONVERSATION I THINK WHAT

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.400
I'M REALLY TRYING TO DIG INTO

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:03.136
HIS THIS IS NOT- CONSISTENT

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:04.971
WITH WHAT WE DO WITH ANOTHER

01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:06.039
PROGRAMS. AND SO I'M REALLY

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:08.174
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:11.044
STILL PRESENT WITHIN- TODAY'S

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:14.347
PROGRAM AND WHAT REASONS- WE

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:17.283
HAVE BECAUSE I. DO WANT TO MAKE

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:20.553
SURE WE ARE- WORKING TO PROVIDE

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.121
THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS OUR

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:23.456
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:25.458
REPRESENTING. PORTION OF THE

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:27.126
MAP THAT IS NOT SEEING THOSE

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:29.829
INCREASES. MANY OF US ARE

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:31.130
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:33.132
RECEIVING OUR FAIR SHARE. AND I

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.934
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.902
TRYING TO TAKEN TO WITHOUT

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.870
QUESTION. WITH THAT I WILL

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:43.810
TRANSITION TO CALFRESH IF I CAN.

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:44.344
AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF I

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:53.486
COULD. NOT CURRENTLY. EXCUSE

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:55.288

WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:07.367
EXPAND UPON THAT FURTHER. GLAD

SUSPENDING LICENCES TO RECOVER

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:06.505
DEBT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.274
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOSE JOBS AND

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.343

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.512
YET OUR CHILD SUPPORT. PROGRAMS

CONTINUE TO USE LICENSE

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:17.483
SUSPENSION AS A WAY TO COLLECT

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:19.285

OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. SO

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:30.129

VEHICLES- WHAT THEY ACTUALLY

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:38.137
SUSPEND WHETHER THEY SUSPENDED

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:38.771
BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:40.606
BECAUSE OF OTHER MATTERS. IS

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:42.408

THAT. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:54.119
SUSPENSION IS MORE ABOUT

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:55.588
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHILD CARE

02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:57.022

SO I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

02:08:43.982 --> 02:08:45.818
IT MAY BE ON THINGS THAT ARE

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:47.486

IF THERE'S THINGS BEYOND THAT

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:52.958

THIS INCREDIBLE PANEL ON

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:01.827
ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY. IN A

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:03.195
RECENT REPORT CONFRONTING

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:05.931
RACISM OVERCOMING COBIT

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:06.865
NINETEEN AND ADVANCING HEALTH

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.867
EQUITY WE PRESENTED AGE

ADJUSTED COVERT NINETEEN CASE

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:11.670
AND DEATH RATES BY RACE

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:13.205
ETHNICITY. AND FOUND THAT

02:10:13.272 --> 02:10:14.706
NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND OTHER

02:10:14.773 --> 02:10:16.575
PACIFIC ISLANDER CALIFORNIANS

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:17.476
AS WELL AS A LOT NEXT

02:10:17.543 --> 02:10:19.044
CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE HIGHEST

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:20.479
RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:22.381
INFECTION AND DEATH. WE

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:24.016
ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY UPDATED

02:10:24.082 --> 02:10:25.517
THE CHARTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

02:10:25.584 --> 02:10:27.286
TODAY'S AGENDA AND THIS REMAINS

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:29.755
UNCHANGED. THESE DISPARITIES

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:31.423
ARE ALARMING ESPECIALLY

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.125
CONSIDERING THAT SOME RACIAL

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:34.760
ETHNIC GROUPS SUCH AS LIVE NEXT

02:10:34.826 --> 02:10:35.928
CALIFORNIANS ARE GENERALLY

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:38.530
YOUNGER. THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.465
GROUPS. AS YOU ALL KNOW AGE IS

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:42.067
RELEVANT BECAUSE THE RISK FOR

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.368
SEVERE ILLNESS AND EVEN DEATH

02:10:43.435 --> 02:10:45.304
FROM COVERT NINETEEN INCREASES

02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:47.439
AS A PERSON. GETS OLDER OF

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:48.941
COURSETHE OTHER MAJOR RISK

02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:50.475
FACTOR IS HAVING AN UNDERLYING

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:51.810
HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:54.580
CONDITION. ASTHMA OR A WEAKENED

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:56.882
IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WE KNOW THAT

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.350
IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.585
NATION RACIAL HEALTH

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.420
DISPARITIES PERSIST IN CHRONIC

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:03.055
HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND EVEN

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:04.890
MORTALITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:06.992
TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK WHY DO

02:11:07.059 --> 02:11:08.327
WE SEE RACIAL HEALTH

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:10.262
DISPARITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.797
THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.532
POINTS TO THE PURPOSE FULL

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.534
INTEGRATION OF RACIST POLICIES

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:17.936
AND PRACTICES FROM HOUSING TO

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.838
THE ENVIRONMENT EMPLOYMENT TO

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:21.907
HEALTH CARE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:24.343
TO EDUCATION. ALL OF THOSE

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:26.578
CONDITIONS IMPACT HEALTH. AND

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:27.512
SO THE RACIAL HEALTH

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:29.381
DISPARITIES IN COVERT NINETEEN

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:31.016
CASES AND THAT'S CONFIRM WHAT

02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:33.185
MANY HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED.

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:34.953
THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:37.522
ISSUE. LONG STANDING ISSUES OF

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:39.157
RACISM EMBEDDED IN EVERY

02:11:39.224 --> 02:11:41.059
INSTITUTION HAVE PLACED PEOPLE

02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:42.394
OF COLOR AT A HIGHER RISK OF

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:45.130
HARM. FROM COVERT NINETEEN. OUR

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.298
REPORT INCLUDE SPECIFIC

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:48.200
EXAMPLES WHERE FROM THE MOMENT

02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:50.402
THE POLICY WAS CONCEIVED THE

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:53.171
INTENT WAS TO BLOCK BLACK LATIN

02:11:53.238 --> 02:11:54.940
NEXT AMERICAN INDIAN AND OTHER

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:56.708
FAMILIES OF COLOR. FROM HIGH

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:58.944
QUALITY HOUSING HEALTHCARE

02:11:59.011 --> 02:12:01.480
EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND THE

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.248
ABILITY TO BUILD GENERATIONAL

02:12:03.315 --> 02:12:05.951
WEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:06.985
SUPPORTED HOUSING

02:12:07.052 --> 02:12:08.920
DISCRIMINATION AND DISPLACEMENT

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:10.922
ON THE BASIS OF RACE IS DEEPLY

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:12.658
INGRAINED IN THE UNITED STATES

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:14.526
THAN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:15.794
INCLUDES THE OFFICIAL

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:18.196
GOVERNMENT POLICY OF REDLINING

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:19.798
PREDOMINATELY PREDOMINATELY

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:21.066
BLACK AND LATIN NEXT

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:23.302
NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH LED TO THE

02:12:23.368 --> 02:12:25.304
DENIAL OF MORTGAGES FOR HOMES

02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:27.239
IN THESE AREAS PREVENTING BOTH

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:28.674
INDIVIDUAL ACCESS TO

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.542
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND NEIGHBORHOOD

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:32.544
CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR BLACK

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:34.413
AND LATIN NEXT FAMILIES.

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:36.448
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE RACIST

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.250
FEDERAL POLICY THAT BLOCK

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:39.918
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:42.154
ACCESSING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.056
COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID I'LL

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:45.924
ORDER FOR PURCHASING FEDERALLY

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:47.826
SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE THROUGH

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:50.262
HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACES

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:52.130
SUCH AS COVERED CALIFORNIA.%

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:54.032
THIS EXCLUSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:55.867
HARMFUL BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:58.303
PROBLEMATIC DURING A PANDEMIC

02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.905
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT LET NEXT

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:01.973
CALIFORNIANS REMAIN MORE LIKELY

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.008
TO BE UNINSURED AND

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.843
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS MAKE

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:06.878
UP THE LARGEST SHARE OF PEOPLE

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.447
WHO LACK HEALTH COVERAGE IN THE

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:10.582
STATE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.250
EXAMPLES AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF

02:13:12.317 --> 02:13:13.685
RESEARCH THAT DOCUMENTS HOW

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:15.420
RACISM PERSISTS IN VARIOUS

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:17.422
INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THAT

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:20.258
IMPACTS HEALTH AS WELL AS THE

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:21.393
EFFECTIVE EVERYDAY RACIAL

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.629
DISCRIMINATION OR INTERPERSONAL

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:26.198
RACISM ON HEALTH. ALL IN ALL

02:13:26.264 --> 02:13:29.501
RACIAL USING RACIAL HEALTH

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:31.036
INEQUITIES ARE THE RESULT OF

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:32.504
POLICYMAKERS AND OTHER

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:34.072
INDIVIDUALS WITH POWER

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:35.640
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.609
POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:39.244
HAVE CREATED ADVANTAGES FOR

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:41.179
WHITE PEOPLE AND HAVE A PRESS

02:13:41.246 --> 02:13:43.815
TO PEOPLE OF COLOR. BOLD POLICY

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.450
ACTION IS NEEDED TO CORRECT

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:47.619
THESE AFFECTS DECLARING RACISM

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:48.954
AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.589
CALIFORNIA IS AN IMPORTANT

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:52.224
FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION

02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.492
BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR POLICY

02:13:53.558 --> 02:13:55.293
MAKERS AND OTHER LEADERS TO

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.262
SOLVE A PROBLEM WE NEED TO

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:58.797
DEFINE IT AND CALIFORNIA HAS

02:13:58.864 --> 02:14:00.599
YET TO DO THAT ALSO

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:02.067
DECLARATIONS ARE OFTEN THE

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:03.935
FIRST STEP IN PROMPTING POLICY

02:14:04.002 --> 02:14:06.371
ACTION. AND THE ALLOCATION OF

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:08.840
RESOURCES. ON A FINAL NOTE WE

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.609
CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SAME

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:13.011
CALIFORNIA OR NORMAL BECAUSE

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.146
THAT WAY OF LIFE WAS NOT

02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:15.714
WORKING FOR SO MANY

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.849
CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. STATE

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:19.985

CREATE A CALIFORNIA WITH ANTI

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.256
RACIST POLICIES THAT VALUE THE

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:26.124

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:29.733
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

TO ENSURE THAT SPECIFIC EQUITY

02:38:32.069 --> 02:38:34.271
FOCUSED PROJECTS WITHIN

ANOTHER RATHER THAN BEING

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.082
DUPLICATIVE OF ONE ANOTHER. SO

02:38:45.148 --> 02:38:47.184
TO THAT END- AND ALSO GIVEN THE

02:38:47.251 --> 02:38:49.119

RESEARCH IS A CONSISTENT.

02:48:53.957 --> 02:48:56.326
PATTERN OF USING THE LAW TO

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:59.128
FORCED BLACK PEOPLE TO WORK ON

02:48:59.195 --> 02:49:02.465
AGAINST OFTEN AGAINST THEIR OWN

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:04.367
BEST INTERESTS. SO WE NEED TO

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:06.536
BE YOU LAWS THAT CURRENTLY IN

02:49:06.603 --> 02:49:08.037
FORCE WORKING GROUP WORK

IN MY GREAT AUNT FORTY YEARS

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:15.712
LIKE. OF ANTI POVERTY WORK I'VE

02:49:15.778 --> 02:49:18.181
STILL YET TO NEED. THE SO

THEY WANT TO GET THEY WANT TO

HAVE MORE INCOME THEY WANT TO

TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN TO

02:49:30.193 --> 02:49:33.229
THE BEST YOU GREET IT WE CAN.

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:35.198
NONETHELESS WE CONTINUE TO SEE

02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:36.366
PROPOSALS IMPOSING WORK

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:38.167
REQUIREMENTS ON RECEIPT OF

02:49:38.234 --> 02:49:40.270
PUBLIC BENEFITS WITH THE MOST

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:42.138
RECENT ATTEMPTS TO DENY HEALTH

02:49:42.205 --> 02:49:44.173
CARE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT MEET

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:46.309
WORK REQUIREMENTS- THANKFULLY

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.244
THE BY DEMONSTRATIONS ROLLING

02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:51.047
BACK THOSE PROPOSALS. ON AND WE

02:49:51.114 --> 02:49:52.248
SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF OUR

02:49:52.315 --> 02:49:54.317
OWN HISTORY OF RACIST POLICIES

02:49:54.384 --> 02:49:56.052
LIKE THE SENATE ONLY JUST MEANT

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:57.587
SETTLING JUST MENTION. LIKE THE

02:49:57.654 --> 02:50:00.490
MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT. OR ARE

02:50:00.557 --> 02:50:05.728
LONG- ENFORCEMENT OF. THE DRUG

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:08.965
OKAY- AN EXCLUSION FOR BOTH

02:50:09.032 --> 02:50:11.501
FRESH AND HOW WORKS APPLIQUE.

02:50:11.568 --> 02:50:13.102
THANKFULLY ALL OF THESE HITTING

02:50:13.169 --> 02:50:16.039
PAUL HAVE BEEN REPEAT IN RECENT

02:50:16.105 --> 02:50:18.908
YEARS BY LUNCH. BUT THEY STOOD

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:21.578
FOR DE. ARMIN VAN PARTICULARLY.

02:50:21.644 --> 02:50:25.915
AFRICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES. ON

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:27.250
SO WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.652
ABOUT THINGS THAT WE COULD DO-

02:50:29.719 --> 02:50:32.288
THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE

02:50:32.355 --> 02:50:34.824
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE WITH OUR

02:50:34.891 --> 02:50:38.695
HOURS PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR-

02:50:38.761 --> 02:50:40.964
ONE IS. WE REALLY WOULD ARGUE

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:42.365
THAT SUPPORT THE NOTION TO

02:50:42.432 --> 02:50:44.300
ABANDON THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:45.868
OF TAMPA. YOU'VE HEARD THIS

02:50:45.935 --> 02:50:46.936
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES BY

02:50:47.003 --> 02:50:49.105
DIFFERENT SPEAKERS TODAY YOUR I

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:50.940
THINK HEARING WHAT IS A GROWING

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:53.009
CONSENSUS ABOUT THE NEED TO DO

02:50:53.076 --> 02:50:54.811
THIS BUT- WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:50:54.877 --> 02:50:57.347
ARGUING THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD

02:50:57.413 --> 02:50:59.649
ELIMINATE THE ARBITRARY FIVE

02:50:59.716 --> 02:51:01.451
YEAR TIME LIMIT. BECAUSE THESE

02:51:01.517 --> 02:51:03.886
TIME LIMITS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE

02:51:03.953 --> 02:51:05.088
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE

02:51:05.154 --> 02:51:06.322
ECONOMY THAT ENDED THAT

02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:08.791
INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO CONTROL

02:51:08.858 --> 02:51:10.860
OVER SO IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:12.929
TO WELL NOT GREAT BUT IT A FIVE

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:13.930
YEAR TIME LIMIT JUST DOESN'T

02:51:13.997 --> 02:51:16.933
WORK. IN AN ECONOMY BURKE JUST

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.068
IN THE PAST DECADE WE HAVE THE

02:51:19.135 --> 02:51:21.638
EXPERIENCE TO DEEPER SESSIONS

02:51:21.704 --> 02:51:23.439
AND SEEM THOUSAND MILLIONS OF

02:51:23.506 --> 02:51:26.209
JOBS GO AWAY SOME OF THESE JOBS

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:28.111
WILL NEVER COME BACK. AND

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:29.545
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT

02:51:29.612 --> 02:51:30.546
THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN

02:51:30.613 --> 02:51:32.682
AGAIN SO I THINK THE STATE

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:33.950
NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT

02:51:34.017 --> 02:51:36.252
CAN DO TO ELIMINATE TIME LIMITS

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:37.854
ON EIGHT ALTOGETHER BY

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.023
EXTENDING OUT STATE PAYMENTS TO

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:41.824
FAMILIES WHO EXCEED THE FEDERAL

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:43.760
GOVERNMENT'S ON CURRENT LAW

02:51:43.826 --> 02:51:45.895
PROHIBITING PAYMENTS BEYOND

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:48.965
SIXTY MONTHS TWO ADULTS. ON YOU

02:51:49.032 --> 02:51:51.234
KNOW SANCTIONS WERE BARBARIC

02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:53.336
TOOL IN ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND

02:51:53.403 --> 02:51:55.104
SOME OF THE PRACTICES I CAN'T

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:59.575
EVEN. REPEAT FOR THIS AUDIENCE

02:51:59.642 --> 02:52:02.412
THEY WERE SO. S. ON AND WHILE

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:04.414
OUR PRACTICE DON'T. INCLUDE

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.983
THOSE SAME THINGS TODAY I'M

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:10.920
DIEM. ARE OFF DAMAGE ON.

02:52:10.987 --> 02:52:11.788
COMPELLING PEOPLE DO WHAT WE

02:52:11.854 --> 02:52:13.690
THINK THEY SHOULD DO WILL NEVER

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:16.359
BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY- WE

02:52:16.426 --> 02:52:19.095
MUST RECOGNIZE THAT SANCTIONS.

02:52:19.162 --> 02:52:22.632
PRINCIPALLY RESULT IN ADVERSE

02:52:22.699 --> 02:52:25.835
CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND THAT THAT

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:28.104
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IS

02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:31.774
BEING MANDATED BY US BY OUR OWN

02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:35.244
LAWS AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING

02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:36.312
WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE AWAY

02:52:36.379 --> 02:52:38.748
FROM- YES THE FEDERAL LAW

02:52:38.815 --> 02:52:40.316
REQUIRES US TO HAVE A SANCTION

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:42.452
POLICY BUT IT DOESN'T TELL US

02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:45.488
HOW THAT HAS TO BE ENFORCED. IT

02:52:45.555 --> 02:52:47.757
MIGHT BE WELL PAST TIME WITH

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.459
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:51.461
TAKE A REAL HARD LOOK AT

02:52:51.527 --> 02:52:55.398
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING IF NOT

02:52:55.465 --> 02:52:55.865
ELIMINATING THE USE OF

02:52:55.932 --> 02:52:57.366
SANCTIONS. AS I MENTIONED

02:52:57.433 --> 02:52:59.569
EARLIER. NO OE SIZE FITS ALL

02:52:59.635 --> 02:53:00.970
WORK REQUIREMENTS NEED TO BE

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:02.772
REPLACED BY HUMAN CENTERED AND

02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:05.007
FAMILY FRIENDLY FRIENDLY PLANTS

02:53:05.074 --> 02:53:06.309
THAT CENTER THE NEEDS OF THE

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:07.977
FAMILY AND NOT THE NEEDS OF THE

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:10.847
STATE OR SOMEBODY WHO THINKS.

02:53:10.913 --> 02:53:12.682
THEY KNOW BETTER FOR FAMILIES

02:53:12.749 --> 02:53:16.219
WHAT THEIR THEIR NEEDS ARE- WE

02:53:16.285 --> 02:53:17.687
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING MORE

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:19.756
EDUCATION AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT

02:53:19.822 --> 02:53:22.091
BY FIVE FAMILIES. THE DATA

02:53:22.158 --> 02:53:24.594
POINTS TO THIS CONCLUSIVELY AS

02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:26.629
THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:27.497
FOR FOLKS TO GET OUT OF

02:53:27.563 --> 02:53:29.198
POVERTY. AGAIN WE SHOULDN'T

02:53:29.265 --> 02:53:31.501
MANDATE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE IT

02:53:31.567 --> 02:53:33.469
EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GO IN THAT

02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:35.805
DIRECTION IF THEY NEED TO- WE

02:53:35.872 --> 02:53:37.974
WOULD STRONGLY. RECOMMEND THAT

02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.041
THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A GOOD

02:53:39.108 --> 02:53:40.943
LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:53:41.010 --> 02:53:42.979
FROM THE CDSS WORKGROUP THAT

02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:43.880
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR

02:53:43.946 --> 02:53:45.915
JOHNSON BY MISS CENTRELINK AND

02:53:45.982 --> 02:53:47.583
OTHERS HERE TODAY I THINK THE

02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:50.887
pTOO. WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT

02:53:50.953 --> 02:53:52.955
OF REALLY GOOD IDEAS THERE WAS

02:53:53.022 --> 02:53:54.724
A GOOD DEAL OF CONSENSUS AMONG

02:53:54.791 --> 02:53:56.392
THE GOALS IN OUT THAT WERE

02:53:56.459 --> 02:53:58.795
OUTLINED IN THE REPORTS. AND WE

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:00.463
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:01.931
TO TRY TO ADOPT MANY OF THOSE

02:54:01.998 --> 02:54:07.870
DURING THIS I'M- COMING BUDGET-

02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:10.106
LASTLY ARE I SHOULD ALSO SAY

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:11.941
WELL WE THE THAT'S OUT POWER

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:12.942
AND WILL BE GETTING THAT THE WE

02:54:13.009 --> 02:54:14.911
FORWARD IN IN FEW YEARS WE

02:54:14.977 --> 02:54:16.479
REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:18.214
NEEDS TO GO FURTHER AND FUND AN

02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:20.149
EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF CAL WORKS

02:54:20.216 --> 02:54:23.352
AND ITS IMPACT THE IMPACT IT'S

02:54:23.419 --> 02:54:23.953
HAD ON POOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.655
OF COLOR. WE BELIEVE A THOROUGH

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:27.924
REVIEW WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT

02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:30.193
MOSTLY THAT HANNAH PROGRAM.

02:54:30.259 --> 02:54:32.395
WILL BY DESIGN RESULT IN

02:54:32.461 --> 02:54:34.564
DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.732
IMPACTS FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. ON

02:54:36.799 --> 02:54:38.234
WE THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:40.002
DATA THAT WE CAN'T KEEP

02:54:40.069 --> 02:54:40.736
STICKING OUR HEAD IN THE

02:54:40.803 --> 02:54:42.271
GROUND. AND ACTING LIKE WE

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.840
DON'T KNOW THAT MORE FAMILIES

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:46.676
WHO ARE. AFRICAN AMERICAN OR

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:48.477
LATINO OR BEING SANCTIONED THE

02:54:48.544 --> 02:54:51.247
WHITE FAMILIES- WE THINK OF AN

02:54:51.314 --> 02:54:52.748
EXAMINATION OF KEY PROGRAM

02:54:52.815 --> 02:54:54.851
TENANTS IS NEEDED TO EXPOSE THE

02:54:54.917 --> 02:54:56.285
FUNDAMENTALLY NEGATIVE OUTCOMES

02:54:56.352 --> 02:54:59.288
THIS PROGRAM. HAS HAD AND

02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:01.724
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE. I'M AND

02:55:01.791 --> 02:55:04.160
THEN FINALLY. UNTIL AND IT CAN

02:55:04.227 --> 02:55:06.229
BE CHANGED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:07.897
COUNTY SHOULD BE IMMUNIZED FROM

02:55:07.964 --> 02:55:09.699
ANY TOWN A FAMILIES IF THE

02:55:09.765 --> 02:55:11.968
STATE FAILS FAILS TO MEET WORK

02:55:12.034 --> 02:55:15.471
PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. ARM

02:55:15.538 --> 02:55:17.039
WITHOUT THAT BUT WE'LL SEE IS

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:18.074
THAT COUNTY BOARD OF

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:20.409
SUPERVISORS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:21.911
FEEL FISCALLY VULNERABLE AND

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:23.846
WILL PUT PRESSURE ON THEIR

02:55:23.913 --> 02:55:26.482
LOCAL PROGRAMS TO GET PEOPLE

02:55:26.549 --> 02:55:28.251
INTO WORK PRESERVATION MEETING

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:29.318
THE WORK THE FEDERAL WORK

02:55:29.385 --> 02:55:30.987
REQUIREMENTS. SO WE THINK IT'S

02:55:31.053 --> 02:55:32.388
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE

02:55:32.455 --> 02:55:34.290
TO STEP UP AND TAKE ON THE

02:55:34.357 --> 02:55:36.058
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE BURDEN

02:55:36.125 --> 02:55:38.327
OF MANAGING ANY CAMERA FAMILIES

02:55:38.394 --> 02:55:40.463
AND TAKING THEM OFF THE BACK OF

02:55:40.529 --> 02:55:42.298
COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

02:55:42.365 --> 02:55:43.966
THE ACTION IS REALLY HAPPENING

02:55:44.033 --> 02:55:45.701
IT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN CLIENTS

02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:47.069
AND COUNTIES THAT THE LOCAL

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:50.373
LEVEL. AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

02:55:50.439 --> 02:55:51.674
THAT NOTHING'S REALLY GOING TO

02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:53.342
CHANGE IN THE CURRENT CHANNEL

02:55:53.409 --> 02:55:55.378
PROGRAM SO LONG AS THE COUNTY'S

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:57.246
FEEL THE BURDEN OF. THOSE

02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:58.881
POTENTIAL PENALTIES COMING ON

02:55:58.948 --> 02:56:00.917
THEM SO THANK YOU FOR THIS

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:06.489
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND.

02:56:06.555 --> 02:56:07.056
REALLY APPRECIATE THIS GREAT

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:07.690
CONVERSATION. THANK YOU NEXT WE

FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

02:56:18.067 --> 02:56:19.702
INSIGHT ON SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:56:19.769 --> 02:56:20.503

WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC.

03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:03.852
PARTICULARLY FOR CALIFORNIANS

03:11:03.919 --> 03:11:05.654

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.158
HOUSING NEEDS LOOK LIKE BEFORE

CO THEN WHY THAT MATTERS AND

03:11:12.027 --> 03:11:14.362

ANTICIPATE AFTER THE PANDEMIC

03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:16.665
IS UNDER CONTROL. FIRST OF

03:11:16.731 --> 03:11:17.866
SPEAK TO HOUSING NEEDS DURING

03:11:17.933 --> 03:11:19.801

DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU

THESE ARE CURRENT AS OF MARCH

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:23.972
FIRST CLEARLY SHOW THAT MANY

03:11:24.039 --> 03:11:25.674
CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:26.441
KEEP UP WITH HOUSING COSTS

03:11:26.508 --> 03:11:28.610
RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ESPECIALLY

03:11:28.677 --> 03:11:29.244
TRUE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW

03:11:29.311 --> 03:11:31.246
INCOMES AMONG RENTERS WITH

03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:32.681
INCOMES UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND

03:11:32.747 --> 03:11:34.749
DOLLARS ONE IN FIVE RECORDED

03:11:34.816 --> 03:11:36.384
BEING BEHIND ON RENT PAYMENTS

03:11:36.451 --> 03:11:37.319
AMONG RENTERS AND HOUSEHOLDS

03:11:37.385 --> 03:11:39.120
WITH CHILDREN ONE IN FOUR

03:11:39.187 --> 03:11:41.156
RECORDED BEING BEHIND ON RENT.

03:11:41.223 --> 03:11:42.357
AND STRUGGLES KEEPING UP WITH

03:11:42.424 --> 03:11:43.625
RENT WERE MOST COMMON AMONG

03:11:43.692 --> 03:11:46.962
CALIFORNIA. RENTERS WHO ARE

03:11:47.028 --> 03:11:47.562
BLACK OR LATIN ACTS. NONE OF

03:11:47.629 --> 03:11:48.763
THIS IS A- BECAUSE LOSSES

03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:50.031
DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVE HIT

03:11:50.098 --> 03:11:51.867
LOW WAGE WORKERS THE HARDEST.

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:53.635
AND HIT HIT BLACK AND NOT NEXT

03:11:53.702 --> 03:11:55.604
WORKERS ESPECIALLY HARD AS THE

03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:57.639
BUDGET CENTER HAS DOCUMENTED. A

03:11:57.706 --> 03:11:59.274
NUMBER OF ACTIONS BY POLICY

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:00.442
MAKERS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL

03:12:00.508 --> 03:12:01.676
LEVELS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:03.178
HELPING CALIFORNIANS MAINTAIN

03:12:03.245 --> 03:12:03.912
STABLE HOUSING DURING THE

03:12:03.979 --> 03:12:05.647
PANDEMIC. THE STATE'S ADDICTION

03:12:05.714 --> 03:12:07.482
MORATORIUM HAS BEEN CRITICAL

03:12:07.549 --> 03:12:09.084
BUT IT CURRENTLY EXPIRES AT THE

03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:10.252
END OF JUNE WHEN IT IS VERY

03:12:10.318 --> 03:12:11.720
UNLIKELY THAT THE JOB MARKET

03:12:11.786 --> 03:12:13.355
WILL HAVE FULLY RECOVERED. ALSO

03:12:13.421 --> 03:12:14.823
SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FEDERAL

03:12:14.890 --> 03:12:16.291
FUNDS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO

03:12:16.358 --> 03:12:17.092
HELP INDIVIDUALS WHO-

03:12:17.158 --> 03:12:18.526
BACKGROUND OR WHO ARE

03:12:18.593 --> 03:12:19.261
STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH

03:12:19.327 --> 03:12:21.162
RENTS. AND THERE BEEN A RANGE

03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:22.364
OF ESTIMATES FROM CREDIBLE

03:12:22.430 --> 03:12:23.765
SOURCES OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

03:12:23.832 --> 03:12:25.000
RENT THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THE

03:12:25.066 --> 03:12:26.735
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE KNOW

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:28.169
THAT A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE

03:12:28.236 --> 03:12:28.803
CALIFORNIA RENTERS ARE

03:12:28.870 --> 03:12:30.472
STRUGGLING NOW. AND WE CAN BE

03:12:30.538 --> 03:12:31.740
SURE THAT MANY WILL STILL BE

03:12:31.806 --> 03:12:32.974
STRUGGLING AT THE END OF JUNE

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:34.009
WHEN THE STATE EVICTION

03:12:34.075 --> 03:12:36.444
MORATORIUM ENDS- AND IN THE

03:12:36.511 --> 03:12:39.414
FALL WHEN ENHANCE UNEMPLOYMENT

03:12:39.481 --> 03:12:40.448
BENEFITS ARE SUCH AND- ONE.

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:42.584
LAST COMMENT ABOUT NEED DURING.

03:12:42.651 --> 03:12:43.985
WHEN THINKING ABOUT URGENT

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:45.687
NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE

03:12:45.754 --> 03:12:46.988
BUDGET CENTER HAS HIGHLIGHTED

03:12:47.055 --> 03:12:47.722
THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING

03:12:47.789 --> 03:12:48.790
ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF

03:12:48.857 --> 03:12:49.524
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

03:12:49.591 --> 03:12:51.026
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND

03:12:51.092 --> 03:12:52.994
THERE'S A MIX THAT I FAMILIES.

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:53.962
THESE INDIVIDUALS CONTRIBUTE

03:12:54.029 --> 03:12:55.430
JUST AS MUCH TO CALIFORNIA'S

03:12:55.497 --> 03:12:57.265
COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMY. IN

03:12:57.332 --> 03:12:58.633
FACT MANY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS

03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:00.502
DURING KOPET. BUT THEY HAVE

03:13:00.568 --> 03:13:01.770
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM MUCH OF THE

03:13:01.836 --> 03:13:02.971
FEDERAL COVET ASSISTANCE AND

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:04.439
ARE BLOCKED FROM MANY OF THE ON

03:13:04.506 --> 03:13:06.241
GOING SO THE SOURCES OF SUPPORT

03:13:06.308 --> 03:13:07.542
WHEN IN CRISIS. SO THEY FACE

03:13:07.609 --> 03:13:11.413
THE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER GAP

03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:11.980
WHEN STRUGGLING TO MAKE MEET

03:13:12.047 --> 03:13:12.914
THEIR BASIC NEEDS. SO THAT'S

03:13:12.981 --> 03:13:14.783
THE HOUSING SITUATION RIGHT NOW

03:13:14.849 --> 03:13:16.318
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO

03:13:16.384 --> 03:13:17.452
LOOK BACKWARD TO THE TIME

03:13:17.519 --> 03:13:19.454
BEFORE KOBE WHICH IS THE SECOND

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:21.122
POINT I WILL BRIEFLY ADDRESS.

03:13:21.189 --> 03:13:22.123
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:23.491
CALIFORNIA FACED A HOUSING

03:13:23.558 --> 03:13:24.926
AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS

03:13:24.993 --> 03:13:27.095
CRISIS BEFORE COVE IT BACK WHEN

03:13:27.162 --> 03:13:28.763
THE ECONOMY WAS FULLY OPEN AND

03:13:28.830 --> 03:13:30.065
BOOMING MORE THAN HALF OF

03:13:30.131 --> 03:13:31.733
CALIFORNIA'S RENTERS AND ABOUT

03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:32.734
EIGHT IN TEN HOUSEHOLDS WITH

03:13:32.801 --> 03:13:34.469
INCOMES UNDER 2100% OF THE

03:13:34.536 --> 03:13:35.937
FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. WE'RE

03:13:36.004 --> 03:13:37.672
ALREADY PAYING AND AFFORDABLE

03:13:37.739 --> 03:13:39.407
AMOUNT TOWARD HOUSING. AND THE

03:13:39.474 --> 03:13:40.542
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST

03:13:40.608 --> 03:13:41.843
LIKELY TO HAVE ON AFFORDABLE

03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:43.044
HOUSING COSTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE

03:13:43.111 --> 03:13:44.879
BLACK LAB MIX THE CIVIC

03:13:44.946 --> 03:13:47.015
ISLANDER AND AMERICAN INDIAN.

03:13:47.082 --> 03:13:47.816
AS WELL AS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

03:13:47.882 --> 03:13:49.884
UNDOCUMENTED. IN TERMS OF

03:13:49.951 --> 03:13:51.052
HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THE

03:13:51.119 --> 03:13:51.920
BLACK CALIFORNIANS IN

03:13:51.987 --> 03:13:53.555
PARTICULAR WERE CARRYING A

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:55.824
STARTLINGLY INEQUITABLE BURDEN

03:13:55.890 --> 03:13:57.592
OF HOMELESSNESS BEFORE COBIT.

03:13:57.659 --> 03:13:59.060
THESE RACIAL INEQUITIES REFLECT

03:13:59.127 --> 03:14:00.662
THE FACT THE BLACK LAB MIX AND

03:14:00.729 --> 03:14:01.763
MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS OF

03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:03.231
COLOR I'M MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

03:14:03.298 --> 03:14:04.599
LOW INCOMES AS A RESULT OF

03:14:04.666 --> 03:14:06.267
STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO

03:14:06.334 --> 03:14:06.768
EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT

03:14:06.835 --> 03:14:08.536
OPPORTUNITIES. AND I'VE ALSO

03:14:08.603 --> 03:14:09.671
BEEN BLOCKED FROM HOUSING

03:14:09.738 --> 03:14:11.172
OPPORTUNITIES IN PART DUE TO A

03:14:11.239 --> 03:14:14.409
LEGACY OF EXPLICITLY RACIST

03:14:14.476 --> 03:14:15.577
HOUSING POLICIES. SO THERE TO

03:14:15.643 --> 03:14:16.578
TAKE TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT WE

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:17.912
KNOW ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS BEFORE

03:14:17.979 --> 03:14:19.314
BECAUSE OF IT. FIRST OF THE

03:14:19.381 --> 03:14:20.648
MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE URGENT

03:14:20.715 --> 03:14:21.783
HOUSING NEEDS EVEN BEFORE THE

03:14:21.850 --> 03:14:23.118
PANDEMIC BECAUSE MILLIONS OF

03:14:23.184 --> 03:14:24.986
PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. AND

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:26.788
SECONDLY EVEN BEFORE KOBE THERE

03:14:26.855 --> 03:14:29.591
WERE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN WHO

03:14:29.657 --> 03:14:30.125
FACE THE GREATEST HOUSING

03:14:30.191 --> 03:14:32.027
CHALLENGES. FINALLY SPEAK ABOUT

03:14:32.093 --> 03:14:32.961
THE HOUSING NEEDS WE MIGHT

03:14:33.028 --> 03:14:34.596
EXPECT TO SEE AFTER WE EMERGE

03:14:34.662 --> 03:14:36.598
FROM THE PENTOMIC. AT THE

03:14:36.664 --> 03:14:37.599
BUDGET CENTER WE WORRY ABOUT

03:14:37.665 --> 03:14:38.767
THE FACT THAT COULD BE JOB

03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:40.235
LOSSES HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED

03:14:40.301 --> 03:14:42.370
AMONG LOW WAGE WORKERS. SO THE

03:14:42.437 --> 03:14:43.571
JOB RECOVERY MAY TAKE THE

03:14:43.638 --> 03:14:45.440
LONGEST TIME FOR THESE WORKERS

03:14:45.507 --> 03:14:46.841
AND SOME OF THE JOBS THESE TO

03:14:46.908 --> 03:14:48.510
HAVE MAYBE PERMANENTLY GONE.

03:14:48.576 --> 03:14:50.011
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THERE

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:51.413
IS SHORT TERM SUPPORT TO HELP

03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:52.547
PEOPLE COPE WITH UNEMPLOYMENT

03:14:52.614 --> 03:14:54.315
AND POVERTY RAT. BUT WE NEED TO

03:14:54.382 --> 03:14:55.450
THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO

03:14:55.517 --> 03:14:56.651
THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STILL

03:14:56.718 --> 03:14:57.986
OUT OF WORK. AND STILL

03:14:58.053 --> 03:14:59.754
STRUGGLING TO COVER HOUSING

03:14:59.821 --> 03:15:00.288
COSTS WHEN THIS EMERGENCY

03:15:00.355 --> 03:15:02.657
SUPPORT ENDS. THESE ARE LIKELY

03:15:02.724 --> 03:15:03.491
TO BE THE CALIFORNIANS WHO

03:15:03.558 --> 03:15:04.893
RESTRICT RECALLING THE MOST OF

03:15:04.959 --> 03:15:05.927
HOUSING NEEDS BEFORE BECAUSE OF

03:15:05.994 --> 03:15:07.595
IT INCLUDING RENTERS. THOSE

03:15:07.662 --> 03:15:09.097
WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES AND

03:15:09.164 --> 03:15:10.732
MANY CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. AS

03:15:10.799 --> 03:15:12.200
WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HIT

03:15:12.267 --> 03:15:13.601
HARDEST BY JOB LOSSES DURING

03:15:13.668 --> 03:15:15.203
THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING BLACK

03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:17.105
AND LET NEXT WORKERS. AND THOSE

03:15:17.172 --> 03:15:18.073
HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM SUPPORT

03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:21.076
DURING HOPE IT INCLUDING

03:15:21.142 --> 03:15:21.676
UNDOCUMENTED AND MIXED STATUS

03:15:21.743 --> 03:15:23.344
FAMILIES. SO I'LL CONCLUDE WHY

03:15:23.411 --> 03:15:25.046
THIS MATTERS. THAT HOUSING IS

03:15:25.113 --> 03:15:26.214
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT

03:15:26.281 --> 03:15:27.682
REPRESENTS SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL

03:15:27.749 --> 03:15:29.884
SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH.

03:15:29.951 --> 03:15:31.186
AND A GATEWAY TO EDUCATIONAL

03:15:31.252 --> 03:15:32.821
AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

03:15:32.887 --> 03:15:34.122
SO THAT EXPERIENCING HOUSING

03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:35.390
INSTABILITY OR WORSE FALLING

03:15:35.457 --> 03:15:37.125
INTO HOMELESSNESS AND SEVERE

03:15:37.192 --> 03:15:39.627
CONSEQUENCES. IT'S ESPECIALLY

03:15:39.694 --> 03:15:40.595
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE HOUSING

03:15:40.662 --> 03:15:41.863
NEEDS ARE MET RIGHT NOW DURING

03:15:41.930 --> 03:15:43.698
THE PATHETIC BUT IT IS ALSO

03:15:43.765 --> 03:15:44.566
IMPORTANT TO THINK BEYOND THE

FUNDS WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE

03:33:48.215 --> 03:33:49.249
TOOL TO ADDRESS THEM. M. IF WE

03:33:49.316 --> 03:33:50.484
KNEW WHETHER FACILITIES WERE

03:33:50.551 --> 03:33:51.952
CLOSING DUE TO DEFERRED

03:33:52.019 --> 03:33:54.121
MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT WOULD

03:33:54.188 --> 03:33:55.155
HELP US UNDERSTAND IF THE

03:34:10.871 --> 03:34:12.539
WHETHER A MORE EFFECTIVE

03:34:12.606 --> 03:34:13.040
INTERVENTION TO PREVENT

03:34:13.106 --> 03:34:16.143

03:38:39.873 --> 03:38:42.042
PANDEMIC CAN BOTH UNCERTAINTY

03:38:42.108 --> 03:38:43.810
AND CONSTANT CHANGE. COUNTING

03:38:43.877 --> 03:38:45.045
THE NUMEROUS TIMES TO TAKE

ARE VERY VERY WELCOME THEY ALSO

03:38:50.317 --> 03:38:51.251
CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PLAN

03:38:51.318 --> 03:38:52.285
OUR BEST FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:38:52.352 --> 03:38:55.822
BLEND TOGETHER SERVICES. ACROSS

03:38:55.889 --> 03:38:57.123
THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS WE OPERATE.

03:38:57.190 --> 03:38:58.158
WHILE WE APPLAUD THE EVICTION

03:38:58.225 --> 03:38:59.993
MORATORIUM BE UNINTENDED THE

03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:01.127
FACT IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN

03:39:01.194 --> 03:39:02.896
MORE DIFFICULT TO HELP OUR

03:39:02.963 --> 03:39:03.763
CLIENTS FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:05.699
OPTIONS. THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO

03:39:05.765 --> 03:39:07.100
THE UNDERLYING LACK OF HOUSING

03:39:07.167 --> 03:39:08.768
STOCK ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE

03:39:08.835 --> 03:39:10.704
RENTAL STOCK THAT WE HAVE

03:39:10.770 --> 03:39:12.239
ACROSS OUR STATE. I'M MORE

03:39:12.305 --> 03:39:13.540
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESPERATE

03:39:13.607 --> 03:39:15.642
IMPACTS OF ONGOING HOUSING

03:39:15.709 --> 03:39:16.243
DIFFICULTIES DURING THE

03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:18.612
PANDEMIC. I'M EXAMPLES INCLUDE

03:39:18.678 --> 03:39:20.413
THOSE LIVING AND NONTRADITIONAL

03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:21.915
ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT A FORMAL

03:39:21.982 --> 03:39:24.017
LEASE LIKE IN A FAMILY MEMBERS

03:39:24.084 --> 03:39:25.252
CONVERTED GARAGE OR SHARING A

03:39:25.318 --> 03:39:26.720
HOME. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:39:26.786 --> 03:39:29.022
PROTECTIONS THAT SOMEONE WITH A

03:39:29.089 --> 03:39:30.390
FORMALLY SOMEWHERE WHERE DO.

03:39:30.457 --> 03:39:31.791
THOSE CAN STILL BE AFFECTED FOR

03:39:31.858 --> 03:39:34.761
NON PANDEMIC RELATED CAUSES ARE

03:39:34.828 --> 03:39:37.030
ALSO OFTEN THOSE THAT WE SERVE.

03:39:37.097 --> 03:39:38.865
ONE EXAMPLE A WOMAN HAS ESCAPED

03:39:38.932 --> 03:39:40.500
A VIOLENT BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND

03:39:40.567 --> 03:39:41.701
I MAKE A CHANGE TO COME AROUND

03:39:41.768 --> 03:39:43.103
HER APARTMENT AND THREATENED

03:39:43.169 --> 03:39:44.371
HER HOUSING HER TO CALL THE

03:39:44.437 --> 03:39:46.206
POLICE. SHE MAY NOT HAVE ANY

03:39:46.273 --> 03:39:47.507
RENTAL PAYMENT PROBLEMS DUE TO

03:39:47.574 --> 03:39:49.376
CO BID AND AS A RESULT THE LAN

03:39:49.442 --> 03:39:50.944
OR CONFLICT OR EVEN NOW FOR

03:39:51.011 --> 03:39:52.679
BEING A DISTURBANCE OR NUISANCE

03:39:52.746 --> 03:39:54.014
TO THE NEIGHBORS. THIS TYPE OF

03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:55.549
THE VICTIM IS ALREADY A PROBLEM

03:39:55.615 --> 03:39:56.850
WITH OUTLOOK ADDED LAYER OF A

03:39:56.917 --> 03:39:58.518
PANDEMIC ON TOP CREATING THE

03:39:58.585 --> 03:39:59.653
POTENTIAL FOR ANY LOSS OF

03:39:59.719 --> 03:40:01.321
HOUSING BECAUSE OF FURTHER

03:40:01.388 --> 03:40:05.191
DOWNWARD. SPIRAL FOR SOMEONE

03:40:05.258 --> 03:40:05.725
WHO EXPERIENCES THAT. IT'S

03:40:05.792 --> 03:40:06.426
REALLY IN. TO UNDERSTAND THE

03:40:06.493 --> 03:40:07.827
CRISIS THAT ADDICTION CREATES

03:40:07.894 --> 03:40:09.262
FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND

03:40:09.329 --> 03:40:11.331
FAMILIES OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO

03:40:11.398 --> 03:40:12.132
THE EVICTION LAB AT PRINCETON

03:40:12.198 --> 03:40:14.167
UNIVERSITY. LOW INCOME WOMEN

03:40:14.234 --> 03:40:16.436
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR.

03:40:16.503 --> 03:40:18.471
ABOUT HIGH RISK OF THE- READERS

03:40:18.538 --> 03:40:19.906
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN DOMESTIC

03:40:19.973 --> 03:40:21.107
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND FAMILIES

03:40:21.174 --> 03:40:22.309
WITH CHILDREN ARE AT

03:40:22.375 --> 03:40:24.344
PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK. THE

03:40:24.411 --> 03:40:25.812
VESSEL HAVE ALSO NOTES OF

03:40:25.879 --> 03:40:27.314
EVIDENCE STRONGLY INDICATES

03:40:27.380 --> 03:40:28.515
THAT THE VICTIM IS NOT JUST A

03:40:28.582 --> 03:40:30.050
CONDITION OF POVERTY AND IS A

03:40:30.116 --> 03:40:32.085
CAUSE OF POVERTY. A BIGGER

03:40:32.152 --> 03:40:33.987
FAMILIES OFTEN WAS CONFESSIONS

03:40:34.054 --> 03:40:35.088
THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THEIR

03:40:35.155 --> 03:40:36.056
COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CHILDREN

03:40:36.122 --> 03:40:36.957
HAVE TO START OVER IN A NEW

03:40:37.023 --> 03:40:38.959
SCHOOL. LANDLORDS SCREEN OUT

03:40:39.025 --> 03:40:40.393
PEOPLE ACQUIRE AND EXPENSE OF

03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:41.428
THESE FAMILIES HAVE AN EVEN

03:40:41.494 --> 03:40:42.829
GREATER DIFFICULTY GETTING BACK

03:40:42.896 --> 03:40:44.731
IN THE QUALITY HOUSING. I ONLY

03:40:44.798 --> 03:40:46.433
KNOW THAT EVICTION CAUSES JOB

03:40:46.499 --> 03:40:48.134
LOSS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY AND

03:40:48.201 --> 03:40:49.502
IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO NEGATIVELY

03:40:49.569 --> 03:40:54.107
AFFECT PEOPLE'S MENTAL. HEALTH

03:40:54.174 --> 03:40:54.741
SOMETIMES FOR YEARS AFTERWARD.

03:40:54.808 --> 03:40:55.508
SO HOW THAT COMPARE. FOR

03:40:55.575 --> 03:40:57.010
CHALLENGES THE FAMILIES FACING

03:40:57.077 --> 03:40:58.044
HOUSING RESTS ON THE RIGHT AS

03:40:58.111 --> 03:41:00.246
THE RED MORATORIUM'S LEFT. AND

03:41:00.313 --> 03:41:01.848
IT IS THE CONTINUING EFFORTS TO

03:41:01.915 --> 03:41:03.083
INCREASE HOUSING STOCK AND MAKE

03:41:03.149 --> 03:41:05.752
IT MORE AFFORDABLE WE ALSO NEED

03:41:05.819 --> 03:41:06.319
TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR

03:41:06.386 --> 03:41:07.721
HOMES AND AVOID EVICTION. WE

03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:08.688
SHOULD BE PLANNING AHEAD TO

03:41:08.755 --> 03:41:10.190
COVER A RARE CHANCE AT LEAST TO

03:41:10.256 --> 03:41:11.958
THE MINIMUM 25% IN THE STATE OF

03:41:12.025 --> 03:41:13.994
EXTEND FAR. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:16.396
BE AFFECTED AS FAR MORE COSTLY

03:41:16.463 --> 03:41:17.897
THAN HELPING THEM STAY HOUSE.

03:41:17.964 --> 03:41:19.366
CEDAR BDA HAS ALSO PUT FORTH A

03:41:19.432 --> 03:41:20.567

NOTED ABOVE THE PREVENTION OF

03:42:08.148 --> 03:42:09.949
EVICTION IS CRITICAL BUT IT'S

03:42:10.016 --> 03:42:11.384
NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL OF THE

03:42:11.451 --> 03:42:13.453
PROGRAMS THEY OPERATE. IN THE

03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:14.921

SERVED WITH AN ACTUAL EVICTION

03:42:25.632 --> 03:42:27.901
NOTICE. THAT'S PRETTY FAR ALONG

03:42:27.967 --> 03:42:29.135
IN THE PROCESS AND AT THAT

03:42:29.202 --> 03:42:30.537
POINT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

03:42:30.603 --> 03:42:32.672
AND OFTEN SIMPLY TOO LATE TO

03:42:32.739 --> 03:42:34.741
INTERVENE SUCCESSFULLY. PUTS US

03:42:34.808 --> 03:42:36.543
IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO HELP

THAT FAMILY FIND A NEW PLACE TO

03:42:37.677 --> 03:42:39.412
LIVE WHICH AS WE TALKED ABOUT

03:42:39.479 --> 03:42:40.580
TAKES MORE TIME IF WE CAN EVEN

03:42:40.647 --> 03:42:41.648
FIND A PLACE THAT THEY CAN

03:42:41.715 --> 03:42:43.583
AFFORD ANOTHER REQUIREMENT

03:42:43.650 --> 03:42:45.385
UNDER THE STATUTE. AND THIS

03:49:07.834 --> 03:49:09.335
BETTER AND SO I WOULD REALLY

03:49:09.402 --> 03:49:11.037
ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO

03:49:11.104 --> 03:49:11.637
REALLY GIVE SERIOUS

03:49:11.704 --> 03:49:13.139
CONSIDERATION TO THOSE

03:49:13.206 --> 03:49:16.776
PROPOSALS. ON MY NAME TESTIMONY

03:49:16.843 --> 03:49:18.778
THOUGH ON THIS PANEL IS THAT. I

03:49:18.845 --> 03:49:20.646
THINK THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN

03:49:20.713 --> 03:49:22.682
THE MOST CHALLENGING THAT OUR

03:49:22.748 --> 03:49:25.118
CLIENTS HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED-

03:49:25.184 --> 03:49:26.586
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS

03:49:26.652 --> 03:49:27.854
PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN

03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:30.189
COMMUNITIES. HAVE SUFFERED BOTH

03:49:30.256 --> 03:49:32.225
THE BULK OF THE JOB LOSSES AND

03:49:32.291 --> 03:49:33.793
HAD THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE KOBE

03:49:33.860 --> 03:49:36.696
CASES AND DEATHS. ON MANY LOW

03:49:36.762 --> 03:49:39.365
INCOME WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS.

03:49:39.432 --> 03:49:40.766
AND MANY OF THESE JOBS MAY

03:49:40.833 --> 03:49:42.835
NEVER COME BACK. AND OTHERS

03:49:42.902 --> 03:49:44.871
LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY

03:49:44.937 --> 03:49:47.807
LOST THEIR CHILD CARE- SO IT'S

03:49:47.874 --> 03:49:49.675
BEEN A REALLY DEVASTATING TIME

03:49:49.742 --> 03:49:51.110
OTHER WORKERS HAVE HAD TO KEEP

03:49:51.177 --> 03:49:53.479
WORKING AS A CENTRAL WORKERS.

03:49:53.546 --> 03:49:55.181
EVEN AT THE RISK OF EXPOSING

03:49:55.248 --> 03:49:56.916
THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIESTO

03:49:56.983 --> 03:49:59.418
COPE. SO I JUST WANT TO REMIND

03:49:59.485 --> 03:50:01.220
THE COMMITTEE JUST ABOUT THE

03:50:01.287 --> 03:50:04.757
EXTRAORDINARILY. STRESSFUL TIME

03:50:04.824 --> 03:50:06.225
THAT. ON LOAN FAMILIES HAVE

03:50:06.292 --> 03:50:08.528
BEEN THE- TWELVE MONTHS AND

03:50:08.594 --> 03:50:09.929
PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO

03:50:09.996 --> 03:50:13.366
EXPERIENCE GOING FORWARD- AS WE

03:50:13.432 --> 03:50:14.901
KNOW MILLIONS OF FAMILIES LOST

03:50:14.967 --> 03:50:16.235
INCOME FROM WORK AND FELL

03:50:16.302 --> 03:50:18.437
BEHIND IN THEIR RENT AND FELL

03:50:18.504 --> 03:50:21.274
BEHIND ANOTHER BILLS ALSO. ON

03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:22.708
THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW WHAT I

03:50:22.775 --> 03:50:25.478
HEAR FROM CLIENTS IS THAT THEY

03:50:25.545 --> 03:50:27.113
HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR SAVINGS

03:50:27.180 --> 03:50:29.048
THEY BORROWED FROM THEIR FAMILY

03:50:29.115 --> 03:50:31.217
IF THEY COULD. MAYBE EVEN SOLD

03:50:31.284 --> 03:50:33.219
THEIR BELONGINGS THANK YOU SIR

03:50:33.286 --> 03:50:34.987
THERE'S BEEN A MAXED OUT THEIR

03:50:35.054 --> 03:50:37.290
CREDIT CARDS. ALL WANTED HIM TO

03:50:37.356 --> 03:50:39.258
MAKE ENDS MEET AND PAY SOME OF

03:50:39.325 --> 03:50:40.960
THE RENT SO THE CAMPER ROF

03:50:41.027 --> 03:50:42.929
OVER THEIR HEADS FOR THEIR

03:50:42.995 --> 03:50:45.698
FAMILIES DURING THIS TIME.

03:50:45.765 --> 03:50:49.302
CUMULATIVELY THE IMPACT OF CODE

03:50:49.368 --> 03:50:52.071
HAS BEEN FINANCIAL DEVASTATION.

03:50:52.138 --> 03:50:54.140
AND WE HAVE SEEN A PERIOD OF

03:50:54.207 --> 03:50:55.875
WEALTH STRIPPING FROM POOR

03:50:55.942 --> 03:50:58.678
CALIFORNIANS UNLIKE ANYTHING IN

03:50:58.744 --> 03:51:01.814
RECENT MEMORY- AND I DON'T NEED

03:51:01.881 --> 03:51:03.583
TO REMIND MOST OF YOU THAT. FOR

03:51:03.649 --> 03:51:05.484
FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE MUCH WILL

03:51:05.551 --> 03:51:06.419
TO STRIP TO BEGIN WITH THEY

03:51:06.485 --> 03:51:09.288
WERE ALREADY ASSET FOR. BUT THE

03:51:09.355 --> 03:51:10.923
LITTLE THAT THEY HAVE IN MANY

03:51:10.990 --> 03:51:14.860
CASES. IS NOW GONE. AND ALL OF

03:51:14.927 --> 03:51:18.164
THIS LARGELY THROUGH NO FAULT

03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:21.834
OF THEIR OWN- AND WHILE INCOMES

03:51:21.901 --> 03:51:24.570
DROP FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS COST

03:51:24.637 --> 03:51:26.339
OFTEN WERE NOT. THERE WERE

03:51:26.405 --> 03:51:28.174
SHORTAGES OF ITEMS THAT CAUSE

03:51:28.241 --> 03:51:31.744
PRICES TO SPIKE THEY- THE STATE

03:51:31.811 --> 03:51:33.312
HOME ORDER MEANT THAT FAMILIES

03:51:33.379 --> 03:51:35.214
HAD TO RELY ON DELIVERY

03:51:35.281 --> 03:51:39.018
SERVICES TO GET CENTRAL ITEMS

03:51:39.085 --> 03:51:42.121
ON SUCH AS FOOD CLOTHES AND

03:51:42.188 --> 03:51:44.590
OTHER NECESSITIES- THIS MONTH

03:51:44.657 --> 03:51:46.993
THE MONEY THAT FAMILIES HAVE.

03:51:47.059 --> 03:51:48.928
IT'S NOT STRETCH AS FAR AS IT

03:51:48.995 --> 03:51:50.997
USED TO AND MANY FAMILIES WERE

03:51:51.063 --> 03:51:53.399
SO MANY CHILDREN ARE SUBJECT TO

03:51:53.466 --> 03:51:55.134
SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL

03:51:55.201 --> 03:51:58.271
DEPRIVATION AND TOXIC STRESS

03:51:58.337 --> 03:52:03.976
DURING THIS TIME. SO. WE I

03:52:04.043 --> 03:52:05.745
REALLY WOULD I THINK THIS IS

03:52:05.811 --> 03:52:09.448
REALLY AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE

03:52:09.515 --> 03:52:11.651
COM WE REALLY NEED TO USE THIS

03:52:11.717 --> 03:52:14.020
MOMENT NOT JUST NOT TO JUST

03:52:14.086 --> 03:52:15.054
HELP FAMILIES OUT OF THEIR

03:52:15.121 --> 03:52:17.323
CURRENT TROUBLES AND GOD KNOWS

03:52:17.390 --> 03:52:20.926
WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE NEED

03:52:20.993 --> 03:52:23.062
TO. IMPORTANT PROPOSALS WHERE

03:52:23.129 --> 03:52:25.064
WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:52:25.131 --> 03:52:28.000
WITH EVEN LESS POVERTY AND BAM

03:52:28.067 --> 03:52:30.069
WE WENT INTO IT WITH. WE NEED

03:52:30.136 --> 03:52:31.604
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR

03:52:31.671 --> 03:52:35.808
TEMPORARY FEDERAL MONEY AND ARE

03:52:35.875 --> 03:52:37.610
FORTUNATE ROBUST STATE

03:52:37.677 --> 03:52:41.447
RESOURCES- AND REALLY TRY TO

03:52:41.514 --> 03:52:43.316
GET MONEY INTO FAMILIES POCKETS

03:52:43.382 --> 03:52:44.950
SO THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR OWN

03:52:45.017 --> 03:52:47.753
NEEDS. LITERALLY THE SINGLE

03:52:47.820 --> 03:52:49.922
MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO

03:52:49.989 --> 03:52:52.058
IS TO GET MONEY TO FAMILIES SO

03:52:52.124 --> 03:52:54.393
THEY SO THEY CAN REBUILD THEIR

03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:57.096
LIVES REBUILD THEIR CREDIT AND

03:52:57.163 --> 03:52:58.898
ALLOW THEM TO ESTABLISH A LEAST

03:52:58.964 --> 03:53:00.666
SOME SAVINGS SO THEY CAN

03:53:00.733 --> 03:53:02.635
WITHSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT

03:53:02.702 --> 03:53:06.172
WHITE DELIVERS- SO HERE'S A FEW

03:53:06.238 --> 03:53:07.440
THINGS SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD

03:53:07.506 --> 03:53:11.944
RECOMMEND. ON THE LEGISLATURE

03:53:12.011 --> 03:53:14.080
I'M SHOULD INCREASE COWART'S

03:53:14.146 --> 03:53:16.949
UNNECESSARY GRANTS ON THE STATE

03:53:17.016 --> 03:53:18.784
COMMITTED TO ENDING CHILDHOOD

03:53:18.851 --> 03:53:21.387
DEEP POVERTY THREE YEARS AGO

03:53:21.454 --> 03:53:23.322
BUT WE NEVER FINISHED THE JOB

03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:25.257
WE SHOULD DO THAT IN TWENTY

03:53:25.324 --> 03:53:27.259
TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE ONE MORE

03:53:27.326 --> 03:53:29.428
STEP TO GO TO GET EVERY CHILD

03:53:29.495 --> 03:53:33.099
IN THE STATE ABOVE 50% OF THE

03:53:33.165 --> 03:53:34.734
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:36.736
EXPLAINED EARLIER THAT'S NOT A

03:53:36.802 --> 03:53:37.570
STANDARD THAT WE'RE

03:53:37.636 --> 03:53:39.638
PARTICULARLY WHILE LOVE BUT IT

03:53:39.705 --> 03:53:41.674
WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT

03:53:41.741 --> 03:53:44.844
STEP FOR. ON AS A SIGN WE NEED

03:53:44.910 --> 03:53:46.145
TO RESTORE THE GRANT CUTS FROM

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:48.881
THE LAST RECESSION. JUST LET ME

03:53:48.948 --> 03:53:50.516
SAY THAT AGAIN FROM THE LAST

03:53:50.583 --> 03:53:51.984
RECESSION NOT THE CURRENT

03:53:52.051 --> 03:53:53.586
RECESSION FOR MOBILE LAB MANY

03:53:53.652 --> 03:53:55.888
YEARS AGO TWELVE YEARS AGO AND

03:53:55.955 --> 03:53:57.723
HAVE STILL NOT BEEN RESTORED.

03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:59.125
AND WHILE IT'S GREAT THAT WE

03:53:59.191 --> 03:54:01.093
GOT SNAP BENEFITS TO RECIPIENTS

03:54:01.160 --> 03:54:03.863
THEY CAN'T SPEND NOW ON PAYING

03:54:03.929 --> 03:54:05.164
FOR THEIR HOUSING COSTS OR

03:54:05.231 --> 03:54:07.333
OTHER UTILITIES. SO WE NEED TO

03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:09.568
GET THOSE GRANTS BACK UP TO

03:54:09.635 --> 03:54:11.303
WHERE THEY WERE AND BEYOND SO

03:54:11.370 --> 03:54:15.341
THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO PAY

03:54:15.408 --> 03:54:17.576
THEIR BILLS. ON THERE TO CLEAN

03:54:17.643 --> 03:54:18.811
OF ANY DIRECTOR JOB SITE I WAS

03:54:18.878 --> 03:54:20.479
HAPPY TO HEAR HER REFERENCE THE

03:54:20.546 --> 03:54:21.947
ISSUES ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE

03:54:22.014 --> 03:54:25.551
S. S. I. CASELOAD. BECAUSE WE

03:54:25.618 --> 03:54:26.252
REALLY THINK THAT'S AN

03:54:26.318 --> 03:54:28.187
IMPORTANT ISSUE ARE WE NEED TO

03:54:28.254 --> 03:54:29.255
DO A BETTER JOB OF GETTING

03:54:29.321 --> 03:54:30.923
PEOPLE INTO THE S. S. I.

03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:32.625
CASELOAD. WE CAN DRAW DOWN

03:54:32.691 --> 03:54:35.861
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AND MOST

03:54:35.928 --> 03:54:37.129
OF THIS IS BEING FRANKLY DRIVEN

03:54:37.196 --> 03:54:39.298
BY A VERY HIGH FEDERAL DENIAL

03:54:39.365 --> 03:54:41.434
RATE. THAT WE STILL SAW START

03:54:41.500 --> 03:54:43.936
TO HAPPEN IN THE PREVIOUS

03:54:44.003 --> 03:54:45.037
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE

03:54:45.104 --> 03:54:46.572
BEST THING WE CAN DO HERE

03:54:46.639 --> 03:54:48.007
INSTANCE SIGNIFICANTLY

03:54:48.073 --> 03:54:49.875
INCREASED LEGAL ADVOCACY AT THE

03:54:49.942 --> 03:54:51.310
BEGINNING OF THE APPLICATION

03:54:51.377 --> 03:54:53.012
PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:54:53.078 --> 03:54:54.880
HAVE LEGAL ADVOCACY AVAILABLE

03:54:54.947 --> 03:54:56.081
FOR RECIPIENTS ARE FOR

03:54:56.148 --> 03:54:57.783
APPLICANTS EXCUSE ME. ALL

03:54:57.850 --> 03:54:59.485
THROUGH THE PROCESS RIGHT

03:54:59.552 --> 03:55:01.520
THROUGH AN APPEAL. WE CAN PUT

03:55:01.587 --> 03:55:03.589
TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF ONE TIME

03:55:03.656 --> 03:55:05.224
FUNDING FOR THIS FIRST PURPOSE

03:55:05.291 --> 03:55:07.059
THAT WOULD BE A VERY EFFECTIVE

03:55:07.126 --> 03:55:09.962
STRATEGY AND- INCREASING SSI.

03:55:10.029 --> 03:55:13.766
ON CASE LOADS. ON WE APPLAUD

03:55:13.833 --> 03:55:14.366
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

03:55:14.433 --> 03:55:15.734
LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING THE

03:55:15.801 --> 03:55:17.269
GOLDEN STATE STATEMENTS IN THE

03:55:17.336 --> 03:55:19.104
GOLDEN STATE GRANT- IT WAS

03:55:19.171 --> 03:55:21.373
REALLY SIGNIFICANT THAT WE

03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:23.609
EXTENDED THESE PAYMENTS TO- TO

03:55:23.676 --> 03:55:25.377
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ON. A

03:55:25.444 --> 03:55:27.646
PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS BECAUSE

03:55:27.713 --> 03:55:30.216
UNFORTUNATELY IS AS MUCH AS WE

03:55:30.282 --> 03:55:32.084
SUPPORT THE APC. YOUR FAMILIES

03:55:32.151 --> 03:55:33.819
DON'T WORK DON'T HAVE INCOME

03:55:33.886 --> 03:55:35.988
FROM WORK AND DON'T BENEFIT IF

03:55:36.055 --> 03:55:37.590
WE ONLY PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE

03:55:37.656 --> 03:55:39.792
I. T. C. SO WE THINK THAT WAS A

03:55:39.859 --> 03:55:41.827
REALLY GREAT STEP WE WOULD ALSO

03:55:41.894 --> 03:55:44.063
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE- IF

03:55:44.129 --> 03:55:45.231
WE DO ANOTHER GOLDEN STATE

03:55:45.297 --> 03:55:48.434
STEMNESS WHICH MEANS. WHAT YOU

03:55:48.501 --> 03:55:50.669
KNOW STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT-

03:55:50.736 --> 03:55:52.137
THAT BE EXTENDED TO PERSONS ON

03:55:52.204 --> 03:56:04.250
GENERAL SYSTEMS WHO ARE NOT.

03:56:04.316 --> 03:56:04.783
INCLUDED IN THIS LOOP MOST

03:56:04.850 --> 03:56:05.584
PREVIOUS FAME. IN THAT WE IN IN.

03:56:05.651 --> 03:56:08.320
WHO DO HAVE TEN. NUMBER

03:56:08.387 --> 03:56:09.622
PAYMENTS TO FOLKS DO ABOUT SEND

03:56:09.688 --> 03:56:11.056
ARE FILE FEDERAL STATE BUT TO

03:56:11.123 --> 03:56:12.658
THOSE WHO DON'T- BUT WE REALLY

03:56:12.725 --> 03:56:13.859
THINK PROVIDE. THESE PAYMENTS

03:56:13.926 --> 03:56:15.427
THESE GOLD SIX SEVEN PAYMENT

03:56:15.494 --> 03:56:16.729
PERIODICALLY- WOULD REALLY GO A

03:56:16.795 --> 03:56:17.830
LONG WAY TO HELPING THESE

03:56:17.897 --> 03:56:19.565
FAMILIES RECOVER. AND WILL HELP

03:56:19.632 --> 03:56:21.667
BOLSTER THE STATE'S ECONOMY SO

03:56:21.734 --> 03:56:23.636
WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO

03:56:23.702 --> 03:56:25.504
CONSIDER APPROVING SEVERAL

03:56:25.571 --> 03:56:27.239
ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF SIX

03:56:27.306 --> 03:56:30.342
HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE IN THE

03:56:30.409 --> 03:56:31.977
COMING BUDGET YEAR- AND AS WE

03:56:32.044 --> 03:56:33.846
KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

03:56:33.913 --> 03:56:34.914
MANY FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO

03:56:34.980 --> 03:56:36.348
PAY THE RENT. AND WE WILL

03:56:36.415 --> 03:56:37.483
STRUGGLE AGAIN AFTER THE

03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:38.517
ECONOMY IMPROVED YOU'VE HEARD

03:56:38.584 --> 03:56:39.985
THE SAME FROM SEVERAL OF THE

03:56:40.052 --> 03:56:42.721
OTHER SPEAKERS AND IT'S A FACT-

03:56:42.788 --> 03:56:44.089
AND GIVEN THE RECENT FEDERAL

03:56:44.156 --> 03:56:45.658
PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE OF THE

03:56:45.724 --> 03:56:48.193
ROBUST STATE REVENUES AGAIN. WE

03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:50.262
SHOULD FUND R A STATE FUNDED

03:56:50.329 --> 03:56:52.031
RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

03:56:52.097 --> 03:56:53.165
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ON

03:56:53.232 --> 03:56:54.934
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE THE

03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:56.769
FIRST PRIORITY FOR THIS RENTAL

03:56:56.835 --> 03:56:59.438
SYSTEMS. WE CAN EASILY IDENTIFY

03:56:59.505 --> 03:57:00.639
THE HOUSEHOLDS WITH HIGH

03:57:00.706 --> 03:57:02.107
HOUSING COSTS FOR EXISTING

03:57:02.174 --> 03:57:03.909
PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS. AND

03:57:03.976 --> 03:57:05.411
PROVIDE THEM WITH ENOUGH CASH

03:57:05.477 --> 03:57:06.779
AID EACH MONTH TO MAKE SURE

03:57:06.845 --> 03:57:08.414
THAT THE RENTS ARE AFFORDABLE

03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:09.648
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO

03:57:09.715 --> 03:57:12.418
CONTINUALLY- PROVIDE EMERGENCY

03:57:12.484 --> 03:57:14.286
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS

03:57:14.353 --> 03:57:17.923
THAT ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:20.025
US TO DO. AND THEN FINALLY I'LL

03:57:20.092 --> 03:57:23.262
CLOSE WITH THIS. SB NINETY ONE

03:57:23.329 --> 03:57:25.831
IT WAS A MILESTONE BILL- WE

03:57:25.898 --> 03:57:27.132
APPLAUD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

03:57:27.199 --> 03:57:29.668
GOVERNOR FOR PASSING IT AND-

03:57:29.735 --> 03:57:30.836
IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW

03:57:30.903 --> 03:57:32.671
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE

03:57:32.738 --> 03:57:35.407
OUTCOMES- AND IT'S GONNA SINCE

03:57:35.474 --> 03:57:37.343
MANY FAMILIES AVOID EVICTION.

03:57:37.409 --> 03:57:38.811
BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP

03:57:38.877 --> 03:57:41.480
RENTERS. IN PARTICULAR WE NEED

03:57:41.547 --> 03:57:42.848
TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS

03:57:42.915 --> 03:57:44.083
DON'T FACE INFECTIONS IF THEY

03:57:44.149 --> 03:57:47.152
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY 25% OF THE

03:57:47.219 --> 03:57:50.189
RENT. BY JUNE FIRST. NOW BAR

PROVISIONS TO IT THAT CAN BE

03:57:53.459 --> 03:57:55.828
EXTREMELY USEFUL HERE. ONE IS

03:57:55.894 --> 03:57:57.563
CAO WORKS THE VERSION WHICH IS

03:57:57.630 --> 03:58:00.065
A VALUABLE SOURCE TO HELP

03:58:00.132 --> 03:58:02.201
WRITERS WHO ARE NOT ON CAL

03:58:02.267 --> 03:58:04.903
WORKS BUT WHO NEED- ONE TIME

03:58:04.970 --> 03:58:07.339
ASSISTANCE. TO BE ABLE TO PAY

03:58:07.406 --> 03:58:10.776
THE RENT THAT THEY- BUT THE

03:58:10.843 --> 03:58:12.244
PROGRAM CURRENTLY HAS SOME

03:58:12.311 --> 03:58:13.979
LIMITATIONS TO PARTICULARLY A

03:58:14.046 --> 03:58:15.314
CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE

03:58:15.381 --> 03:58:18.717
PROVIDED. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:58:18.784 --> 03:58:19.251
SEE THAT RAISED. WE ALSO

03:58:19.318 --> 03:58:21.353
PROVIDE FUNDING TO FAMILIES OF

GOVERNMENT. WOULD WOULD BE

03:58:29.361 --> 03:58:31.130
USEFUL FOR THAT PURPOSE SO YOU

03:58:31.196 --> 03:58:31.930
KNOW WE ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE

03:58:31.997 --> 03:58:33.999
VERY USEFUL TO USE THOSE FUNDS

03:58:34.066 --> 03:58:35.067
TO MAKE ONE TIME PAYMENTS TO

03:58:35.134 --> 03:58:37.536
FAMILIES. BUT IN ANY CASE WE

03:58:37.603 --> 03:58:38.771
NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE

03:58:38.837 --> 03:58:40.305
FAMILIES AWARE THAT THIS IS AN

03:58:40.372 --> 03:58:42.741
OPTION. AND THAT WE- INCREASE

03:58:42.808 --> 03:58:44.309
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPLYING

03:58:44.376 --> 03:58:46.612
FOR THESE FUNDS NOW SO THAT

03:58:46.679 --> 03:58:48.213
WHEN JUNE COMES JUNE FIRST

03:58:48.280 --> 03:58:49.948
ROLLS AROUND WE DON'T HAVE

03:58:50.015 --> 03:58:50.983
FAMILIES GETTING EVICTED

03:58:51.050 --> 03:58:52.184
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE

03:58:52.251 --> 03:58:54.420
TO GO TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT

03:58:54.486 --> 03:58:55.287
25% THAT THEY NEED TO PAY FOR

03:58:55.354 --> 03:58:57.623
THE RENT. SO WITH THAT WILL

03:58:57.690 --> 03:58:59.191

THESE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE

04:00:02.988 --> 04:00:04.123

WILL JUST START BY SAYING THAT-

04:00:40.092 --> 04:00:42.060
IN ANY IN ANY PROGRAM AND AS WE

04:00:42.127 --> 04:00:43.962
THINK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE HERE

04:00:44.029 --> 04:00:45.931
TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE-

04:00:45.998 --> 04:00:48.433
THE BROADER AT THE RATE THE

04:00:48.500 --> 04:00:50.235
BRIGHTER THE ELIGIBILITY ARE AT

04:00:50.302 --> 04:00:51.770
WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF

04:00:51.837 --> 04:00:53.305
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE GREATER

04:00:53.372 --> 04:00:53.939
NEEDS THE TO THE COMMENTS THAT

04:00:54.006 --> 04:00:57.876
WERE MADE. RELATED TO WHERE AN

04:00:57.943 --> 04:01:01.146
INDIVIDUAL IS EXPERIENCING- A

04:01:01.213 --> 04:01:02.748
FICTION EXCEPT AROUND ITS BELT

04:01:02.815 --> 04:01:04.216
THOSE TRADE OFFS ARE GOING TO

04:01:04.283 --> 04:01:06.018
BE THAN RELATED TO THEIR

04:01:06.084 --> 04:01:07.920
RESOURCES THAT WE CURRENTLY

04:01:07.986 --> 04:01:10.055
HAVE. GRAMS ARE YEAH DETENTION

04:01:10.122 --> 04:01:11.223
THERE WOULD BE THEN HOW MANY

04:01:11.290 --> 04:01:12.958
PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED FOR A

04:01:13.025 --> 04:01:14.359
LONGER DURATION SHOULD KNOW

04:01:14.426 --> 04:01:17.196
WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING- BE

04:01:17.262 --> 04:01:18.230
INCLUDED SO THOSE ARE THE

04:01:18.297 --> 04:01:20.299
TENSION POINTS ARE RT. THE WHAT

04:01:20.365 --> 04:01:21.667
WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IF WE

04:01:21.733 --> 04:01:23.936

04:01:24.002 --> 04:01:27.039
OR- A CHANGE BROAD KNOWLEDGE

04:01:27.105 --> 04:01:29.374
ABILITY REQUIREMENTS- FINALLY I

04:01:29.441 --> 04:01:30.909
WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON

C. W. D. A.'S- RECOMMENDATIONS

04:01:33.779 --> 04:01:35.614
REGARDING IMPROVEMENTS OF THE

04:01:35.681 --> 04:01:38.517
H. S. P. PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY

04:01:38.584 --> 04:01:40.118
THEY NEED TO HAVE AN ACTUAL

04:01:40.185 --> 04:01:42.554
OBJECTION NOTICE OR AGAIN THE

04:01:42.621 --> 04:01:44.356
LONGER TERM SUBSIDIES JUST

04:01:44.423 --> 04:01:44.923
HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON

04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:47.726
THAT. SURE SUMMER LOOKS

04:01:47.793 --> 04:01:48.894
SIMILARLY I WOULD SAY MY

04:01:48.961 --> 04:01:50.262
RESPONSE IS THE SAME THAT AGAIN

04:01:50.329 --> 04:01:52.264
IF WE WANT TO BROADEN RIGHT NOW

04:01:52.331 --> 04:01:55.400
WE ARE AGAIN REALLY FOCUSED ON

04:01:55.467 --> 04:01:58.103
ENSURING THAT- WE CAN PREVENT

04:01:58.170 --> 04:01:59.738
THAT THAT ELECTION FOR THE

04:01:59.805 --> 04:02:00.973
PERSON WHO'S IMMEDIATELY FACING

04:02:01.039 --> 04:02:03.041
IT. IF WE WERE TO BROADEN

04:02:03.108 --> 04:02:04.776
ELIGIBILITY AND NOT HAVE THAT

04:02:04.843 --> 04:02:07.079
KIND OF REQUIREMENTS- THAT WE

04:02:07.145 --> 04:02:09.114
WOULD LIKELY SEE ADDITIONAL

04:02:09.181 --> 04:02:11.550
NEEDS- IN SUPPORT AND SO AGAIN

04:02:11.617 --> 04:02:14.019
EITHER WE'RE GOING TO I ASKED

04:02:14.086 --> 04:02:15.721
SERVE FEWER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE

04:02:15.787 --> 04:02:18.924
LONGER- OR AT SERVE A DIFFERENT

04:02:18.991 --> 04:02:20.225
POPULATION IT NEEDS THE RIGHT

04:02:20.292 --> 04:02:21.393
NOW WE ARE PRIORITIZING THOSE

04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:23.962
SECOND IMMINENT RISK ABDUCTION.

04:02:24.029 --> 04:02:25.898
I THINK WE WITHIN THE

04:02:25.964 --> 04:02:29.234
LEGISLATURE- WOULD NEED TO

04:02:29.301 --> 04:02:32.170
UNDERSTAND THE DATA AND- FOR

04:02:32.237 --> 04:02:33.872
GAP ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS

04:02:33.939 --> 04:02:35.908
AS IF YOU'RE OPERATING UNDER

04:02:35.974 --> 04:02:38.143
THE SAME RESOURCES AND- IT

04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:39.411
WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO

04:02:39.478 --> 04:02:41.113
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH NEED THERE

04:02:41.179 --> 04:02:42.681
IS OUT THERE AND WHETHER OR NOT

04:02:42.748 --> 04:02:43.949
OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE BEING

04:02:44.016 --> 04:02:45.884
RESOURCE APPROPRIATELY AND SO.

04:02:45.951 --> 04:02:47.286
I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR US

04:02:47.352 --> 04:02:49.354
ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS- I

04:02:49.421 --> 04:02:52.424

YOUTH AS THEY ARE PARTICULARLY

04:03:01.566 --> 04:03:03.435
SUSCEPTIBLE TO HOMELESSNESS.

IT'S ON PAGE FIFTY EIGHT OF THE

04:03:16.882 --> 04:03:19.618
AGENDA. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

04:03:19.685 --> 04:03:20.953
FIFTY EIGHT AND HAD STATED THAT

04:03:21.019 --> 04:03:22.521

DOLLARS AND PUBLIC RESOURCES.

04:03:35.701 --> 04:03:38.036
IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO HELP

04:03:38.103 --> 04:03:40.138
THESE FACILITIES TO INCENTIVIZE

04:03:40.205 --> 04:03:41.673
THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

04:03:41.740 --> 04:03:43.141
TAKEN CARE OF OUR MOST

04:03:43.208 --> 04:03:46.244
VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AS WELL.

OF THE- INVESTMENTS IN THESE

ABSOLUTELY HOW WE INTEND FOR

04:03:59.224 --> 04:04:01.026
THE PROGRAM TO WORK OUT. I

THAT AT THE CENTER LANE WITH

05:17:24.492 --> 05:17:27.661
THE WPA. SO OPPOSITION THIRTY

05:17:27.728 --> 05:17:30.431

CONSTITUTIONAL RELATES TO THAT

05:17:40.007 --> 05:17:41.542
HAS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF

05:17:41.609 --> 05:17:42.977
INCREASING COSTS AND REALIGN

05:17:43.043 --> 05:17:44.879
PROGRAM NEED ONLY BE

05:17:44.945 --> 05:17:46.580

ENSURE THAT PROPOSITION THIRTY

05:17:51.786 --> 05:17:53.053
REQUIREMENTS WERE MET WITH THE

05:17:53.120 --> 05:17:54.321
CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR

05:17:54.388 --> 05:17:56.924
LEGISLATION THAT LEGISLATION

05:17:59.059 --> 05:18:01.028
ENSURE THAT NEW COSTS THAT ARE

05:18:01.095 --> 05:18:02.196
COUNTY WOULDN'T HER ON THE

05:18:02.263 --> 05:18:03.864
MARGIN WE'RE GOING TO BE

05:18:03.931 --> 05:18:05.299
COVERED BY THE GENERAL FUND.

05:18:05.366 --> 05:18:07.701
AND SO- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

05:18:07.768 --> 05:18:11.071
ORIGINAL CONTINUING CARE BILL

05:18:11.138 --> 05:18:12.339
EIGHTY FOUR OH THREE IT CREATED

05:18:12.406 --> 05:18:14.341
REQUIREMENTS ALL OVER THE PLACE

05:18:14.408 --> 05:18:16.010
THAT WERE EXPANDED BUT THEY'RE

05:18:16.076 --> 05:18:19.079
OFTEN BUILT ON THE TYPES OF.

05:18:19.146 --> 05:18:20.848
ACTIVITIES ARE WORKERS ALREADY

05:18:20.915 --> 05:18:24.251
DEAD SO- IN MOST COUNTIES THAT

05:18:24.318 --> 05:18:26.220
FOR EXAMPLE WE DID ALREADY

05:18:26.287 --> 05:18:28.422
APPROVED RELATIVE CAREGIVERS

05:18:28.489 --> 05:18:30.724
AND DID SOME LICENSING OF NON

05:18:30.791 --> 05:18:32.560
RELATIVE FOSTER PARENTS AS WELL

05:18:32.626 --> 05:18:34.261
AND SO THE ADDITIONAL

05:18:34.328 --> 05:18:35.996
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IF THEY

05:18:36.063 --> 05:18:38.365
REQUIRED WOULD BE THAT MARGINAL

05:18:38.432 --> 05:18:39.900
COST INCREASE FOR THAT

05:18:39.967 --> 05:18:41.969
PARTICULAR COMPONENT. OF LOS

05:18:42.036 --> 05:18:43.838
ANGELES COUNTY IS A COUNTY%

05:18:43.904 --> 05:18:45.806
TITLE BODIES OF THEIR LARGEST

05:18:45.873 --> 05:18:47.074
COUNTY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

05:18:47.141 --> 05:18:47.908
KNOW THAT THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T

05:18:47.975 --> 05:18:49.109
DO ANY OF THEIR OWN LICENSING

05:18:49.176 --> 05:18:51.312
PRIOR TO THE C. R. SO TAKING ON

05:18:51.378 --> 05:18:57.518
THAT ROLE WOULD. BE ENTIRELY

05:18:57.585 --> 05:18:58.352
NEW FOR THEM FOR EXAMPLE. SO-

05:18:58.419 --> 05:19:00.387
I'M THE PROPERTY THIRTY ALSO.

05:19:00.454 --> 05:19:02.056
NOT DOES JUST APPLY TO STATURE

05:19:02.122 --> 05:19:03.757
CHAIN. IT ALL APPLIES.

05:19:03.824 --> 05:19:05.759
INSTRUCTIONS THE STATE ISSUES

05:19:05.826 --> 05:19:07.495
SO ALL COUNTY LETTERS ALL

05:19:07.561 --> 05:19:09.330
COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTOR LETTERS

05:19:09.396 --> 05:19:12.066
WHICH ARE TO. KEY WAYS THAT

05:19:12.132 --> 05:19:13.701
THAT STATE COMMUNICATES WITH

05:19:13.767 --> 05:19:15.336
OUR COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES

05:19:15.402 --> 05:19:17.238
DIRECTORS ALSO HAVE THE FORCE

05:19:17.304 --> 05:19:19.473
OF LAW AND THEREFORE THEY ARE

05:19:19.540 --> 05:19:20.741
ALSO COVERED BY PROPOSITION

05:19:20.808 --> 05:19:22.510
THIRTY. SO THE QUESTION A LOOK

05:19:22.576 --> 05:19:25.713
AT IN DECIDING HOW PROPOSITION

05:19:25.779 --> 05:19:27.448
THIRTY APPLIES TO SOMETHING

05:19:27.515 --> 05:19:31.218
LIKE THE RFA IS TO SEE. WHAT

05:19:31.285 --> 05:19:34.288
WAS- EXPANDED REQUIRED AS A

05:19:34.355 --> 05:19:36.257
RESULT OF THE LEGISLATION AND

05:19:36.323 --> 05:19:38.792
THEN IT ALSO ANY SUBSEQUENT

05:19:38.859 --> 05:19:39.593
INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE PUT

05:19:39.660 --> 05:19:41.929
TOGETHER. SO IRATE REFERRED

05:19:41.996 --> 05:19:43.063
BRIEFLY TO THAT'S IN MY

05:19:43.130 --> 05:19:45.099
TESTIMONY THE ORIGINAL

05:19:45.165 --> 05:19:46.901
LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE

05:19:46.967 --> 05:19:49.870
IDEA OF MERGING TOGETHER THESE

05:19:49.937 --> 05:19:52.640
PROPHECIES OF ARMS WIFE

05:19:52.706 --> 05:19:54.341
SOMETHING OR APPROVING A FOSTER

05:19:54.408 --> 05:19:57.278
PARENT. ALSO DOING PROPHECIES

05:19:57.344 --> 05:19:58.979
RELATED TO HOME STUDIES THAT.

05:19:59.046 --> 05:20:00.781
FORUM ADOPTION OR OTHER

05:20:00.848 --> 05:20:02.883
PERMANENT THE THAT USED TO BE

05:20:02.950 --> 05:20:04.285
DONE WAY DOWN THE LINE- WHAT WE

05:20:04.351 --> 05:20:06.554
DECIDED- YES THIS CHILD IS NOT

05:20:06.620 --> 05:20:07.855
GOING TO BE REUNIFIED

05:20:07.922 --> 05:20:09.356
UNFORTUNATELY SO WE'RE GOING TO

05:20:09.423 --> 05:20:10.658
MOVE INTO A PERMANENCY PLANNING

05:20:10.724 --> 05:20:12.059
PROCESS. THOSE THINGS ARE

05:20:12.126 --> 05:20:14.395
PRETTY SEPARATE IT SO THE IDEA

05:20:14.461 --> 05:20:15.963
OF RFA WAS TO MERGE ALL THAT

05:20:16.030 --> 05:20:17.698
TOGETHER. THAT LEGISLATION

05:20:17.765 --> 05:20:19.099
WHICH WAS CARRIED BY WANTING

05:20:19.166 --> 05:20:21.969
HIM LOCKED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

05:20:22.036 --> 05:20:24.638
AND SPONSORED BY CWPA CREATED

05:20:24.705 --> 05:20:26.307
FIVE PILOT PROJECTS IT HAD

05:20:26.373 --> 05:20:27.508
NOTHING TO DO WITH A STATEWIDE

05:20:27.575 --> 05:20:30.277
MANDATE OF. THE SYSTEM BECAUSE

05:20:30.344 --> 05:20:31.812
WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW AT THAT

05:20:31.879 --> 05:20:33.280
POINT IN TIME EXACTLY WHAT WAS

05:20:33.347 --> 05:20:35.416
REQUIRED- BUT ASPECTS WOULD BE

05:20:35.482 --> 05:20:38.319
NEEDED. AND SO THEN TWENTY

05:20:38.385 --> 05:20:39.320
ELEVEN REALIGNMENT HAPPENED A

05:20:39.386 --> 05:20:41.121
PROPOSITION THIRTY WITH ENACTED

05:20:41.188 --> 05:20:44.892
AND THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AB

05:20:44.959 --> 05:20:45.359
FOUR THREE CREATED THE

05:20:45.426 --> 05:20:47.161
CONTINUOUS CARE FORM AND IT IS

05:20:47.227 --> 05:20:49.296
THAT BILL PLUS THE SUBSEQUENT

05:20:49.363 --> 05:20:50.698
INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE SENT OUT

05:20:50.764 --> 05:20:52.466
BY THE STATE THAT CREATED THE

05:20:52.533 --> 05:20:58.405
STATEWIDE. MANDATE AND PUT MUCH

05:20:58.472 --> 05:21:00.874
MORE STE AFTER A- THE OR PA AND

05:21:00.941 --> 05:21:03.877
LAW SO WHEN THE ADMIN. SAYS NO

05:21:03.944 --> 05:21:04.511
WE DO NOT NEED TO FOR YOU FOR

05:21:04.578 --> 05:21:06.246
THE IN ACT RELATED TO OUR FAITH

05:21:06.313 --> 05:21:08.582
BECAUSE IT EXISTED BEFORE THE

05:21:08.649 --> 05:21:09.583
TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT IT'S

05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:11.418
JUST AN ACCURATE AND IT'S ALSO

05:21:11.485 --> 05:21:12.753
INCONSISTENT I HAVE TO SAY WITH

05:21:12.820 --> 05:21:14.254
ITS OWN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

05:21:14.321 --> 05:21:15.990
INSTRUCTIONS. THAT STARTED

05:21:16.056 --> 05:21:18.692
BEING ISSUED IN TWENTY

05:21:18.759 --> 05:21:19.560
SEVENTEEN THAT EVEN THEMSELVES

05:21:19.627 --> 05:21:20.494
CLEARLY LIKE THE STATEWIDE

05:21:20.561 --> 05:21:23.097
MANDATE WITH AB FOR A THREE NOT

05:21:23.163 --> 05:21:24.498
WITH THAT EARLIER LEGISLATION

05:21:24.565 --> 05:21:26.400
AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT

05:21:26.467 --> 05:21:29.870

05:28:55.048 --> 05:28:56.483
REPRESENTATIO BASED ON THE

05:28:56.550 --> 05:28:58.618
STATE'S POPULATION IN TERMS OF

05:29:02.556 --> 05:29:03.890
SEVENTEEN ARE 8% OF THOSE

05:29:03.957 --> 05:29:06.726

LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT'S

05:30:28.408 --> 05:30:30.777
MAINLY DUE TO THE FACTORS.

05:30:30.844 --> 05:30:32.546
AROUND ELIGIBILITY REMAINING IN

05:30:32.612 --> 05:30:36.183

TWENTY. ON NEARLY 60% INCREASE

05:36:30.303 --> 05:36:31.804
AND THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF

05:36:31.871 --> 05:36:32.972
FACTORS THAT WAS PEOPLE WE

05:36:33.039 --> 05:36:34.107

AND SO THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS

05:37:34.133 --> 05:37:35.134
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR

05:37:35.201 --> 05:37:36.469
US GOING FORWARD IN THE POST

05:37:36.536 --> 05:37:38.938
CODE LANDSCAPE. AND THEN

05:37:39.005 --> 05:37:39.472
CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR

05:37:39.539 --> 05:37:40.773
NETWORK. WITH BETTER DATA

05:37:40.840 --> 05:37:44.577
SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO

05:37:44.644 --> 05:37:45.178
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO MEET THE

05:37:45.244 --> 05:37:46.546
NEEDS. THE LAST QUESTION YOU

05:37:46.613 --> 05:37:48.648
ASKED. ABOUT BOTH- MYSELF AND

05:37:48.715 --> 05:37:49.816
MY COLLEAGUE LONG TERM CARE-

05:37:49.882 --> 05:37:51.551
BUT CERTAIN HIGHEST PRIORITY

05:37:51.618 --> 05:37:53.419
CHALLENGES. AND HERE'S THE

05:37:53.486 --> 05:37:55.154
THREE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON.

05:37:55.221 --> 05:37:57.256
RECOVERING FROM KOBE NINETEEN

05:37:57.323 --> 05:37:58.691
THE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OLDER

05:37:58.758 --> 05:38:00.393
CALIFORNIANS THAT OUR FAMILIES.

05:38:00.460 --> 05:38:02.695
OUT RENDERING INEQUITIES BY

05:38:02.762 --> 05:38:05.632
RACE AND AGE AND GENDER THAT

05:38:05.698 --> 05:38:08.768
ARE OUT. REALLY MAKING AGING

05:38:08.835 --> 05:38:10.103
EXPERIENCE VERY DIFFERENT AND

05:38:10.169 --> 05:38:12.839
VERY LIKABLE IN CALIFORNIA. IN

05:38:12.905 --> 05:38:14.107
THREE REBUILDING BETTER WE'RE

05:38:14.173 --> 05:38:15.575
NOT GOING BACK TO THE WAY WE

05:38:15.642 --> 05:38:16.776
DID THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED TOO

05:38:16.843 --> 05:38:18.378
MUCH INCOME TO FAR SO HOW DO WE

05:38:18.444 --> 05:38:20.046
REBUILD BETTER SO WE'RE GONNA

05:38:20.113 --> 05:38:21.280
BE LASER FOCUSED ON HOME AND

05:38:21.347 --> 05:38:22.482
COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT ALLOW

05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:24.517
PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME. AND

05:38:24.584 --> 05:38:25.585
AVOID UNNECESSARY

05:38:25.652 --> 05:38:27.387
INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE

05:38:27.453 --> 05:38:28.755
DIGITAL DIVIDE PROGRAMS THE

05:38:28.821 --> 05:38:30.690
FOOD PROGRAMS THE BEHAVIORAL

05:38:30.757 --> 05:38:31.958
HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT HELP

05:38:32.025 --> 05:38:34.093
PEOPLE THRIVE AT HOME AND THEN

05:38:34.160 --> 05:38:35.094
AS I HANDED OVER TO MY

05:38:35.161 --> 05:38:36.262
COLLEAGUE TO THE STATE LONG

05:38:36.329 --> 05:38:38.798
TERM CARE ON BUT- ALSO THE

05:38:38.865 --> 05:38:41.401
SECOND PRIORITY IS- WHAT CAN WE

05:38:41.467 --> 05:38:42.602
DO TO INTEGRATE IN A

05:38:42.669 --> 05:38:44.070
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES BASED

05:38:44.137 --> 05:38:45.905
NURSING HOME SPACE. WHERE OF

05:38:45.972 --> 05:38:47.907
FAR TOO MANY NEARLY A THIRD

05:38:47.974 --> 05:38:49.075
240% OF DEATHS THAT HAPPEN

05:38:49.142 --> 05:38:50.843
DESPITE BEING LESS THAN 1% OF

05:38:50.910 --> 05:38:52.845
THE POPULATION. SO THERE'S SO

05:38:52.912 --> 05:38:54.447
MANY LESSONS TO LEARN TO GO

05:38:54.514 --> 05:38:55.782
FORWARD IN OUR NURSING HOME AND

05:38:55.848 --> 05:38:57.684
RESIDENTIAL SPACE- AND THEN

05:38:57.750 --> 05:39:00.019
LASTLY. WE TAKE OUR ROLE VERY

05:39:00.086 --> 05:39:02.789
SERIOUSLY AS UP ENGAGING AROUND

05:39:02.855 --> 05:39:04.590
AGING COMMUNICATING AROUND AGE

05:39:04.657 --> 05:39:05.491
AND THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN

05:39:05.558 --> 05:39:07.393
INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES AND

05:39:07.460 --> 05:39:08.428
ASSISTANCE IT ALSO MEANS

05:39:08.494 --> 05:39:09.962
COMMUNICATING ABOUT AGEISM AND

05:39:10.029 --> 05:39:11.831
RACISM AND OF COURSE AT THIS

05:39:11.898 --> 05:39:13.399
MOMENT THE PARTICULAR TAX ON. A

05:39:13.466 --> 05:39:15.268
OLDER API'S IN IN OUR STATE AND

05:39:15.334 --> 05:39:17.170
OUR NATION AND SO THAT THAT'S

05:39:17.236 --> 05:39:18.604
WHERE WE'RE FOCUSED IS

05:39:18.671 --> 05:39:21.374
ADDRESSING AGEISM- INNOVATING

05:39:21.441 --> 05:39:23.643
IN NURSING HOMES AND EXPANDING

05:39:23.710 --> 05:39:24.143

SERVICES SO WE CAN ALL THRIVE

05:39:25.645 --> 05:39:27.146
IN THE HOMES WE CHOOSE. SO WITH

05:39:27.213 --> 05:39:29.749
THAT- I WILL SAY ALL OF THAT

05:39:29.816 --> 05:39:31.851

NINE VOLUNTEERS WERE RESIGNED

05:43:13.039 --> 05:43:15.875
MOSTLY BECAUSE OF A RELUCTANCE

05:43:15.942 --> 05:43:19.045
TO GOING TO FACILITIES. LOCAL

05:43:52.645 --> 05:43:55.081
RAISED BY THIS PRACTICE. IT MAY

05:43:55.147 --> 05:43:56.382
BE ALSO DIFFICULT FOR SOME

THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTING AND

05:45:48.727 --> 05:45:50.796
PAST FALL OUR OFFICE LOOKED

05:45:50.863 --> 05:45:53.165
INTO LTSS PROGRAM CAPACITY IN

05:45:53.232 --> 05:45:55.234
THE STATE IN WHICH WE FOUND

05:45:55.301 --> 05:45:56.669
THAT THE AVAILABILITY AND

05:45:56.735 --> 05:45:59.638
UTILIZATION OF LTSS PROGRAMS IS

05:45:59.705 --> 05:46:01.907
UNEVEN ACROSS THE STATE I'M AS

05:46:01.974 --> 05:46:03.809
IT RELATES TO AVAILABILITY SOME

05:46:03.876 --> 05:46:06.412
LTSS PROGRAMS- ARE NOT

05:46:06.479 --> 05:46:08.447
AVAILABLE IN ALL COUNTIES AND

05:46:08.514 --> 05:46:10.149
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN

05:46:10.216 --> 05:46:11.283
BE SERVED IN SOME PROGRAMS IS

05:46:11.350 --> 05:46:13.986
CAPPED. IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION

05:46:14.053 --> 05:46:15.955
WE LOOKED AT WHAT SHARE OF

05:46:16.021 --> 05:46:17.356
MEDICAL SENIORS AND PERSONS

05:46:17.423 --> 05:46:20.192

EVERY COUNTY AND IN COMPARING

05:46:24.763 --> 05:46:26.165
THOSE UTILIZATION RATES ACROSS

05:46:26.232 --> 05:46:28.501
COUNTIES WE FOUND THAT LTSS

05:46:28.567 --> 05:46:31.670
UTILIZATION TENDS TO BE LOWER

05:46:31.737 --> 05:46:33.572
AND EASTERN SIERRA COUNTIES.

05:46:33.639 --> 05:46:35.541
AND UTILIZATION RATES TEND TO

05:46:35.608 --> 05:46:37.710
BE HIGHER AND I'M THREE

05:46:37.776 --> 05:46:38.878

05:46:47.119 --> 05:46:49.355
INDICATIVE AB ACCESS ISSUES

05:46:49.421 --> 05:46:51.257
EITHER BECAUSE PROGRAMS ARE NOT

05:46:51.323 --> 05:46:53.792
AVAILABLE IN SOME COUNTIES OR

05:46:53.859 --> 05:46:55.961
THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL BARRIERS

05:46:56.028 --> 05:46:57.396
AND PROVIDING SERVICES TO ALL

05:46:57.463 --> 05:47:00.833
ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN CERTAIN

05:47:00.900 --> 05:47:04.036
AREAS. AS FAR. OF FUTURE DEMAND

05:47:04.103 --> 05:47:06.272
WE IDENTIFIED- CERTAIN ELEMENTS

05:47:06.338 --> 05:47:08.507
THAT MAY IMPACT DEMAND TRENDS

05:47:08.574 --> 05:47:10.609
SUCH AS- THE FACT THAT THE

05:47:10.676 --> 05:47:13.345
SENIOR POPULATION IS PROJECTED

05:47:13.412 --> 05:47:15.114
TO INCREASE AT A FASTER RATE

05:47:15.181 --> 05:47:16.215
THAN THE STATE'S POPULATION AS

05:47:16.282 --> 05:47:18.417
A WHOLE. ALSO THE FACT THAT THE

05:47:18.484 --> 05:47:20.085
SENIOR POPULATION IS BECOMING

05:47:20.152 --> 05:47:21.887
MORE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY

05:47:21.954 --> 05:47:23.622
DIVERSE AND SENIORS ARE

05:47:23.689 --> 05:47:25.391
PROJECTED TO LIVE LONGER AND

05:47:25.457 --> 05:47:26.892
THAT MATTERS BECAUSE FOR THOSE

05:47:26.959 --> 05:47:29.161
PARTICULAR SUBGROUPS. I'M THEY

05:47:29.228 --> 05:47:31.130
TEND TO HAVE HIGHER DISABILITY

05:47:31.197 --> 05:47:33.032

05:47:33.098 --> 05:47:33.999
SENIORS OR THE NUMBER OF

05:47:34.066 --> 05:47:35.801
SENIORS I'M IN PERSONS WITH

05:47:35.868 --> 05:47:37.970
DISABILITIES THAT MAY REQUIRE

05:47:38.037 --> 05:47:41.707
LTSS SERVICES- MAY BE GREATER

05:47:41.774 --> 05:47:43.442
IN THE FUTURE. IN DETERMINING

05:47:43.509 --> 05:47:46.078
THE OF THE ABILITY OF THE STATE

05:47:46.145 --> 05:47:48.013
OF STATE LTSS PROGRAMS TO THEN

05:47:48.080 --> 05:47:50.015
RESPONDS TO POTENTIAL RISING

05:47:50.082 --> 05:47:51.717

05:47:51.784 --> 05:47:54.553
FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF

05:47:54.620 --> 05:47:55.654
CURRENT PROGRAM DESIGN AND

05:47:55.721 --> 05:47:58.057
RULES. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE I

05:47:58.123 --> 05:47:59.258
MENTIONED BEFORE SOME PROGRAMS

05:47:59.325 --> 05:48:01.794
ARE CONSTRAINED- IN THE NUMBER

05:48:01.860 --> 05:48:04.330
OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN STARVE-

05:48:04.396 --> 05:48:05.764
ADDITIONALLY SOME PROGRAMS ARE

05:48:05.831 --> 05:48:08.267
CONSTRAINED- IN PROVIDING

05:48:08.334 --> 05:48:10.069

05:48:14.373 --> 05:48:16.175
CERTAIN MEDIC CAL ELIGIBILITY

05:48:16.242 --> 05:48:18.577

DISABILITIES THEY CAN START.

05:48:22.047 --> 05:48:23.215
WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM PROGRAM

05:48:23.282 --> 05:48:25.217
ADMINISTRATORS THAT START UP

05:48:25.284 --> 05:48:27.186
COSTS ARE A BARRIER TO

05:48:27.253 --> 05:48:28.587
EXPANDING SERVICES IN NEW

05:48:28.654 --> 05:48:30.256

05:48:30.322 --> 05:48:32.124
REGIONAL VARIATION IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS- ALSO

05:48:34.660 --> 05:48:36.495
PRESENTS A CHALLENGE I'M IN

05:48:36.562 --> 05:48:37.763
MEETINGS NOT ONLY CURRENT

05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:41.133
POSSIBLY FUTURE PROGRAM DEMAND.

05:48:41.200 --> 05:48:41.934
MOVING ON TO THE SECOND

05:48:42.001 --> 05:48:44.403
QUESTION- WHEN IT COMES TO

05:48:44.470 --> 05:48:46.705
ACCESSIBILITY WITHIN THE I JUST

05:48:46.772 --> 05:48:48.340
AS ENORMOUS AS P. PROGRAM AND I

05:48:48.407 --> 05:48:49.942
JUST SAYS WE HAVE HEARD

05:48:50.009 --> 05:48:51.143
ANECDOTALLY THAT THE

05:48:51.210 --> 05:48:53.312
AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS I'M

RECIPIENTS THAT LIVE IN

05:48:58.651 --> 05:49:00.686
ISOLATED AREAS OR HAVE COMPLEX

05:49:00.753 --> 05:49:03.555
CARE NEEDS- MAYBE- LIMIT.

05:49:03.622 --> 05:49:05.457
ACCESSIBILITY LEVELS AND IN THE

05:49:05.524 --> 05:49:07.326
CASE OF M. S. S. P. THE FACT

05:49:07.393 --> 05:49:08.093
THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT

05:49:08.160 --> 05:49:10.162
AVAILABLE IN ALL COUNTIES BUT

05:49:10.229 --> 05:49:13.332
ALSO- PARTICIPATION IS CAPPED

05:49:13.399 --> 05:49:15.768
ALSO PRESENT ACCESSIBILITY

05:49:15.834 --> 05:49:18.137
ISSUES. WHEN IT COMES TO

05:49:18.203 --> 05:49:19.204
FRAGMENTATION BEYOND THE

05:49:19.271 --> 05:49:20.572
LIMITED AVAILABILITY AND

05:49:20.639 --> 05:49:22.441
ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES I'VE

05:49:22.508 --> 05:49:23.742
ALREADY DISCUSSED ANOTHER

05:49:23.809 --> 05:49:25.311
FORMER FRAGMENTATION THAT OUR

05:49:25.377 --> 05:49:26.845
OFFICE HAS EXPLORED THAT

05:49:26.912 --> 05:49:29.448
APPLIES TO ALL LTSS PROGRAMS

05:49:29.515 --> 05:49:30.783
INCLUDES FRAGMENTATION IN THE

AND TAKE AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

05:49:33.052 --> 05:49:35.354
SO WHILE LTSS PROGRAMS MAY HAVE

05:49:35.421 --> 05:49:36.322
SIMILAR ELIGIBILITY

05:49:36.388 --> 05:49:38.324
REQUIREMENTS AN INDIVIDUAL

05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:40.159

SEPARATE INTAKE ASSESSMENT

PROCESS SEES FOR EACH PROGRAM.

05:49:44.396 --> 05:49:46.298
SO NOT ONLY DOES THAT PRESENT-

05:49:46.365 --> 05:49:48.133
DUPLICATIVE ADMINISTRATIVELY

05:49:48.200 --> 05:49:50.302
INEFFICIENT PRACTICE SAYS BUT

05:49:50.369 --> 05:49:52.004
FOR THE RECIPIENT AND MAY ALSO

05:49:52.071 --> 05:49:53.572

05:49:53.639 --> 05:49:55.140
ISSUES IF THE INFORMATION

05:49:55.207 --> 05:49:56.742
COLLECTED IN ONE PROGRAM IS IT

05:49:56.809 --> 05:49:58.177

05:50:06.285 --> 05:50:08.354
TO BETTER ASSESS ANY POTENTIAL

05:50:08.420 --> 05:50:09.988
SERVICE GAPS FOR THAT RESPOND

05:50:10.055 --> 05:50:11.824

THAT EFFECTIVELY THEN

05:54:03.088 --> 05:54:04.990

05:55:48.694 --> 05:55:49.661
UNDERSTANDING THAT SINCE

05:55:49.728 --> 05:55:50.829
CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL

PACKETS. AND IT'S UNDERSTAND

05:56:16.588 --> 05:56:17.989
THAT THAT'S LARGELY DUE TO THE

OFF OF RECENT FEDERAL GUIDANCE

05:56:44.316 --> 05:56:46.151
THE STATE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

FOR CARE IS GROWING. THE DELAYS

05:57:55.687 --> 05:57:56.922
IN APPROVAL AND PROVISION OF

05:57:56.988 --> 05:57:58.957

05:57:59.024 --> 05:58:01.359
OF WORKERS MAKE- AT OR NEAR

05:58:01.426 --> 05:58:03.195
MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS FAIRLY

05:58:03.261 --> 05:58:04.563
FAR OFF FROM A LIVING WAGE IN

05:58:04.629 --> 05:58:08.366
CALIFORNIA- THE WRONG THINGS

05:58:08.433 --> 05:58:08.967
THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT

05:58:09.034 --> 05:58:10.468
BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN TWENTY

05:58:10.535 --> 05:58:13.438
NINETEEN. ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND.

05:58:13.505 --> 05:58:15.273
RECIPIENTS ON AVERAGE EACH

05:58:15.340 --> 05:58:17.309
MONTH DID NOT RECEIVE CARE.

05:58:17.375 --> 05:58:19.845
THIS NUMBER IS UP FROM TWENTY

05:58:19.911 --> 05:58:20.378
FIFTEEN WHEN IT WAS ABOUT

05:58:20.445 --> 05:58:22.314
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. A PERSON

05:58:22.380 --> 05:58:23.782
PERSPECTIVE OVER THE FIVE YEAR

05:58:23.849 --> 05:58:26.384
PERIOD THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT A

05:58:26.451 --> 05:58:27.018
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION

05:58:27.085 --> 05:58:28.653
HOURS OF CARE. THAT WERE

05:58:28.720 --> 05:58:30.789
APPROVED. BUT HAD NOT BEEN

05:58:30.856 --> 05:58:32.891
PROVIDED. ARE THESE GAPS IN

05:58:32.958 --> 05:58:34.059
CARE CAN OCCUR FOR A LOT OF

05:58:34.125 --> 05:58:35.861
REASONS. INCLUDING ANY

05:58:35.927 --> 05:58:37.629
INABILITY TO HIRE A CARE GIVER

05:58:37.696 --> 05:58:39.598
OR- AN INSTANCE WHERE A

05:58:39.664 --> 05:58:42.767
RECIPIENT HAS MOVED. AND

05:58:42.834 --> 05:58:43.368
THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING

05:58:43.435 --> 05:58:45.337
A NEW CARE GIVER. STATE LAW

05:58:45.403 --> 05:58:47.939
REQUIRES COUNTIES TO ENSURE THE

05:58:48.006 --> 05:58:50.442
CARE IS PROVIDED. THROUGH IHS

05:58:50.508 --> 05:58:53.378
TO ALL RECIPIENTS- AND THIRTY

05:58:53.445 --> 05:58:54.913
TWO OF FIFTY ONE COUNTIES THAT

05:58:54.980 --> 05:58:56.314
WE SURVEYED ABOUT THIS

05:58:56.381 --> 05:58:58.250
RESPONDED THAT THEY LACKED A

05:58:58.316 --> 05:58:59.284
SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CARE

05:58:59.351 --> 05:59:01.253
GIVERS TO PROVIDE ALL

05:59:01.319 --> 05:59:01.753
RECIPIENTS WITH APPROVED

05:59:01.820 --> 05:59:04.322
SERVICES. THIS IS BECOMING MORE

05:59:04.389 --> 05:59:06.658
IMPORTANT AS ABOTH LOCAL

05:59:06.725 --> 05:59:07.559
SERVICES IN THE LEGISLATIVE

05:59:07.626 --> 05:59:09.527
ANALYST'S OFFICE POINTED OUT

05:59:09.594 --> 05:59:11.596
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE

05:59:11.663 --> 05:59:13.031
INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY FIVE IS

05:59:13.098 --> 05:59:15.600
GROWING. AND THEY ALSO

05:59:15.667 --> 05:59:17.369
REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF IT

05:59:17.435 --> 05:59:20.372
JUSTICE RECIPIENT- WE ESTIMATE

05:59:20.438 --> 05:59:22.240
THAT BY THE END OF THE DECADE

05:59:22.307 --> 05:59:23.775
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED

05:59:23.842 --> 05:59:25.076
THROUGH I. HFS COULD GROW FROM

05:59:25.143 --> 05:59:27.012
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. TO

05:59:27.078 --> 05:59:28.747
ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

05:59:28.813 --> 05:59:29.614
THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

05:59:29.681 --> 05:59:32.050
JUMP- AND IT WILL REQUIRE MORE

05:59:32.117 --> 05:59:37.289
CARE GIVERS. B. WE FOUND IN OUR

05:59:37.355 --> 05:59:39.624
AUDIT THAT- COUNTIES ARE TAKING

05:59:39.691 --> 05:59:41.326
AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY TWO

05:59:41.393 --> 05:59:44.596
DAYS. TO APPROVED APPLICANTS

05:59:44.663 --> 05:59:46.231
FOR I. H. AT THE THIRD OF THE-

05:59:46.298 --> 05:59:48.233
SO PER THE REQUIRED COUNTY TO

05:59:48.300 --> 05:59:49.801
DO THIS IN ABOUT THIRTY DAYS

05:59:49.868 --> 05:59:50.435
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

05:59:50.502 --> 05:59:52.003
EXCEPTIONS. WITH LOCAL

05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:54.172
GOVERNMENTDOESN'T TRACK THOSE

05:59:54.239 --> 05:59:57.309
EXCEPTIONS- MORE SPECIFICALLY

05:59:57.375 --> 05:59:58.877
MOST RECIPIENTS COMING TO THE

05:59:58.944 --> 06:00:00.812
PROGRAM RECEIVE SERVICES FROM A

06:00:00.879 --> 06:00:02.347
FAMILY MEMBER OR FOR SOMEONE

06:00:02.414 --> 06:00:03.648
CLOSE TO THEM BASICALLY THEY

06:00:03.715 --> 06:00:05.216
COME TO THE PROGRAM WITH A

06:00:05.283 --> 06:00:09.087
RECIPIENT. HOWEVER A LARGE

06:00:09.154 --> 06:00:10.689
NUMBER OF ABOUT 15% OF THE

06:00:10.755 --> 06:00:15.527
RECALL DON'T. AND THAT NUMBER

06:00:15.593 --> 06:00:17.329
IS LIKELY TO GROW OVER THE NEXT

06:00:17.395 --> 06:00:18.596
TEN YEARS OF THE PUBLIC POLICY

06:00:18.663 --> 06:00:19.698
INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA

06:00:19.764 --> 06:00:22.300
REPORTED THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE

06:00:22.367 --> 06:00:23.435
ARE JUST GETTING OLDER BUT

06:00:23.501 --> 06:00:24.469
THEY'RE CHANGING YOU HAVE

06:00:24.536 --> 06:00:26.471
FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE LESS

06:00:26.538 --> 06:00:27.772
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED OR

06:00:27.839 --> 06:00:29.708
LOOK LIKELY TO HAVE CHILDREN

06:00:29.774 --> 06:00:31.743
WHO WOULD BE WATCHING THEM THIS

06:00:31.810 --> 06:00:33.244
IS GOING TO REQUIRE AN EVEN

06:00:33.311 --> 06:00:35.613
GREATER FOCUS ON NON FAMILY

06:00:35.680 --> 06:00:38.183
CAREGIVERS ON GETTING

06:00:38.249 --> 06:00:38.917
RECIPIENTS MATCHED WITH CARE

06:00:38.984 --> 06:00:42.487
GIVERS. THEY DON'T ALREADY KNOW

06:00:42.554 --> 06:00:43.021
THAT THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY

06:00:43.088 --> 06:00:45.256
ARRANGED FOR- ONE OF OUR

06:00:45.323 --> 06:00:46.825
RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT

06:00:46.891 --> 06:00:49.394
COUNTIES BEGIN TO CONDUCT

06:00:49.461 --> 06:00:51.496
PLANNING AROUND. THE PROVISION

06:00:51.563 --> 06:00:53.164
OF CARE. THIS IS ACTUALLY

06:00:53.231 --> 06:00:54.866
REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW AND

06:00:54.933 --> 06:00:55.400
IT'S BEEN IN STATE LAW FOR

06:00:55.467 --> 06:00:58.636
QUITE SOME TIME. BUT COUNTY IS

06:00:58.703 --> 06:00:59.871
NOT A COUNTIES NORTH OF FOCAL

06:00:59.938 --> 06:01:01.339
BERMAN COULD PROVIDE US WITH AN

06:01:01.406 --> 06:01:03.375
EXAMPLE OF ANY ANY ANNUAL

06:01:03.441 --> 06:01:05.810
REPORT THAT ANY COUNTY HAD DONE

06:01:05.877 --> 06:01:07.545
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE THEY

06:01:07.612 --> 06:01:10.048
DONE DAYS- SO WE'RE

06:01:10.115 --> 06:01:11.082
RECOMMENDING THE COUNTIES BEGIN

06:01:11.149 --> 06:01:12.884
DOING SO IMMEDIATELY AND THAT

06:01:12.951 --> 06:01:14.586
THEY INCLUDE IN. THESE ANNUAL

06:01:14.652 --> 06:01:17.922
REPORTS- AN EXAMINATION OF.

06:01:17.989 --> 06:01:21.526
WHAT FUTURE NEEDS MIGHT BE- IN

06:01:21.593 --> 06:01:23.261
OUR SURVEY ONLY TWO COUNTIES

06:01:23.328 --> 06:01:24.462
REPORTED CONDUCTING ANY KIND OF

06:01:24.529 --> 06:01:25.830
PLANNING FOR CURRENT OR FUTURE

06:01:25.897 --> 06:01:28.266
CARE GIVER NEEDS BUT AGAIN NO

06:01:28.333 --> 06:01:30.201
ONE HAD SUBMITTED THESE PLANS

06:01:30.268 --> 06:01:32.704
OFFICIALLY TO SOCIAL SERVICE.

06:01:32.771 --> 06:01:36.875
BOB DE FINAL ELEMENT WE LOOKED

06:01:36.941 --> 06:01:39.344
AT WAGES CAREGIVER WAGES

06:01:39.411 --> 06:01:41.579
COMPARE THEM TO THE LIVING WAGE

06:01:41.646 --> 06:01:42.981
AS CALCULATED BY THE

06:01:43.048 --> 06:01:43.515
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF

06:01:43.581 --> 06:01:46.785
TECHNOLOGY- ON AVERAGE ACROSS

06:01:46.851 --> 06:01:48.853
THE STATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN

06:01:48.920 --> 06:01:50.455
CARE GIVERS EARNED A LITTLE

06:01:50.522 --> 06:01:52.657
OVER TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR.

06:01:52.724 --> 06:01:54.559
THE LIVING WAGE AT THAT TIME

06:01:54.626 --> 06:01:55.226
WAS ABOUT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN

06:01:55.293 --> 06:01:57.128
HOUR THAT'S A PRETTY

06:01:57.195 --> 06:02:01.066
SIGNIFICANT GAP- IN THE FOUR

06:02:01.132 --> 06:02:02.033
COUNTIES THAT WE LOOKED AT IN

06:02:02.100 --> 06:02:03.701
DETAIL THEY ALL HAD SIMILAR

06:02:03.768 --> 06:02:08.039
GAPS. THE RESULT OF THIS IS

06:02:08.106 --> 06:02:09.874
THAT AS COUNTIES NEED TO

06:02:09.941 --> 06:02:11.643
RECRUIT CAREGIVERS IN THE

06:02:11.709 --> 06:02:14.112
FUTURE THESE LOWER WAGES MAY

06:02:14.179 --> 06:02:15.947
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM

06:02:16.014 --> 06:02:17.849
TO FIND CARE GIVERS ONE OF THE

06:02:17.916 --> 06:02:20.218
ISSUES THAT WE BROUGHT UP WAS

06:02:20.285 --> 06:02:20.819
THAT- SOME ELEMENTS OF STATE

06:02:20.885 --> 06:02:24.155
LAW PENALIZE COUNTY THAT GET

06:02:24.222 --> 06:02:25.156
AHEAD OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND

06:02:25.223 --> 06:02:27.559
TRY TO RAISE CAREGIVER WAGES A

06:02:27.625 --> 06:02:29.561
LITTLE BIT IN ADVANCE OF WHEN

06:02:29.627 --> 06:02:32.197
THE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP. AND

06:02:32.263 --> 06:02:33.364
BECAUSE OF THAT A LOT OF

06:02:33.431 --> 06:02:36.167
COUNTIES HAD BACKTRACKED YOU.

06:02:36.234 --> 06:02:39.270
JUST PROVIDING MINIMUM WAGE- I

06:02:39.337 --> 06:02:41.039
JUST THE CARE GIVERS ALTHOUGH A

06:02:41.106 --> 06:02:43.041
RECENT CHANGE IN LAW HAS HAVE

06:02:43.108 --> 06:02:44.742
RELAXED THAT SOMEONE IN THERE

06:02:44.809 --> 06:02:45.910
ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTIES NOW

06:02:45.977 --> 06:02:48.179
THAT HAVE PAID TO THEIR- AGES

06:02:48.246 --> 06:02:50.615
AS WE DO. TO THE MINIMUM WAGE.

06:02:50.682 --> 06:02:52.984
AND THEY'RE A TO ALLOW HIM TO

06:02:53.051 --> 06:02:54.786
RAISE THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOVE.

06:02:54.853 --> 06:02:57.789
THE MINIMUM WAGE. BUT WHEN

06:02:57.856 --> 06:03:00.692
THESE WAGES STAY THAT LOW. THEY

06:03:00.758 --> 06:03:02.494
ARE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER LOW

06:03:02.560 --> 06:03:06.931
WAGE JOBS AND SO FINDING THESE

06:03:06.998 --> 06:03:07.565
CARE GIVERS CAN BECOME A

06:03:07.632 --> 06:03:11.069
CHALLENGE- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

06:03:11.136 --> 06:03:13.371
IN THIS AREA INCLUDED- AGAIN

06:03:13.438 --> 06:03:15.006
GETTING RID OF THIS PENALTY

06:03:15.073 --> 06:03:19.244
THAT- COUNTIES HAVE TO PAY

06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.878
EXTRA IF THEY GET AHEAD OF THE

06:03:19.944 --> 06:03:23.014
MINIMUM WAGE. AND ALSO- THE

06:03:23.081 --> 06:03:24.215
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER

06:03:24.282 --> 06:03:26.551
SOME BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR

06:03:26.618 --> 06:03:28.920
COUNTIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH

06:03:28.987 --> 06:03:31.489
A WIDE GAP BETWEEN. THE

06:03:31.556 --> 06:03:32.323
CAREGIVER WAGES IN THE LIVING

06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:35.126

OF PREPARATION AND LOW WAGES

THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING

06:30:17.293 --> 06:30:18.995
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AS WE

06:30:19.062 --> 06:30:21.498
BEGIN THAT PROCESS IN TWENTY

06:30:21.564 --> 06:30:22.432
NINETEEN WE KNEW HOW IMPORTANT

06:30:22.499 --> 06:30:24.567
IT WAS TO LIFT UP THE ISSUES

06:30:24.634 --> 06:30:26.369
FACED BY OLDER CALIFORNIANS.

06:30:26.436 --> 06:30:28.071
AND THAT STATE DEMOGRAPHIC

06:30:28.138 --> 06:30:29.239
CHANGES ALONE WE'RE GOING TO

06:30:29.305 --> 06:30:32.275
REQUIRE EQUITABLE THOUGHTFUL

06:30:32.342 --> 06:30:34.110
EXPANSIVE AND HOLISTIC PLANNING.

06:30:34.177 --> 06:30:35.845
WHAT WE COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED

06:30:35.912 --> 06:30:37.180
OR PREDICTED WITH A GLOBAL

06:30:37.247 --> 06:30:38.081
PANDEMIC THAT WOULD

06:30:38.148 --> 06:30:40.250
DISPROPORTIONATELY INFECTED AND

06:30:40.316 --> 06:30:41.985
KILLED OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE

06:30:42.051 --> 06:30:43.653
WITH DISABILITIES. ESPECIALLY

06:30:43.720 --> 06:30:45.688
THOSE IN THE BLACK WHAT NEXT

06:30:45.755 --> 06:30:47.724
INDIGENOUS AN API COMMUNITIES

06:30:47.791 --> 06:30:49.492
WOULD RIP TO THE STATE NATION

06:30:49.559 --> 06:30:53.630
AND WORLD. IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY

06:30:53.696 --> 06:30:56.599
74% OF KOBE GAS. IN ADULTS

06:30:56.666 --> 06:30:58.001
SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER EVEN

06:30:58.067 --> 06:30:59.035
THOUGH THEY CONSTITUTE LESS

06:30:59.102 --> 06:31:02.438
THAN 11% OF CONFIRMED CASES.

06:31:02.505 --> 06:31:03.907
KOBE NINETEEN CRISIS HAS

06:31:03.973 --> 06:31:05.742
REVEALED AND EXACERBATED THE

06:31:05.809 --> 06:31:07.310
SHORTCOMINGS IN CALIFORNIA'S

06:31:07.377 --> 06:31:09.145
SAFETY NET SYSTEMS FOR ALL

06:31:09.212 --> 06:31:11.681
POPULATIONS. BUT ESPECIALLY FOR

06:31:11.748 --> 06:31:14.918
OLDER ADULTS. BUT IT HAS ALSO

06:31:14.984 --> 06:31:16.986
SHOWN HOW MUCH WE CAN DO AND

06:31:17.053 --> 06:31:18.555
HOW QUICKLY WE CAN DO IT WHEN

06:31:18.621 --> 06:31:20.557
WE ACT WITH RESOLVE.

06:31:20.623 --> 06:31:22.058
CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN SERVICES

06:31:22.125 --> 06:31:23.293
PROGRAMS THAT SERVE OLDER

06:31:23.359 --> 06:31:27.397
ADULTS INCLUDING HSS MSSP APS.

06:31:27.463 --> 06:31:28.965
AS A SCIENCE IS P. AND SENIOR

06:31:29.032 --> 06:31:31.067
NUTRITION PROVED HOW VITAL THEY

06:31:31.134 --> 06:31:33.269
WERE AND ARE TO INSURE IN OLDER

06:31:33.336 --> 06:31:34.304
ADULTS CAN LIVE SAFELY IN THE

06:31:34.370 --> 06:31:35.672
COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY DURING A

06:31:35.738 --> 06:31:37.874
PANDEMIC. ON THE INVESTMENT

06:31:37.941 --> 06:31:39.642
SIDE IS REQUIRED THE

06:31:39.709 --> 06:31:41.244
LEGISLATURE TO HOLD THE LINE

06:31:41.311 --> 06:31:42.579
AGAINST CUTS TO THESE PROGRAMS

06:31:42.645 --> 06:31:44.280
LAST YEAR EVEN WHEN

06:31:44.347 --> 06:31:46.883
CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET SITUATION

06:31:46.950 --> 06:31:48.518
SEEM DIRE. FINDING THAT POINT

06:31:48.585 --> 06:31:50.186
AND WINNING WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO

06:31:50.253 --> 06:31:52.255
ENSURING THAT WE WERE NOT.

06:31:52.322 --> 06:31:54.023
THERE WERE NOT EVEN MORE DIRE

06:31:54.090 --> 06:31:56.960
EFFECTS FROM KOGAN. NOW THE

06:31:57.026 --> 06:31:58.261
LEGISLATURE HAS THE CHANCE TO

06:31:58.328 --> 06:31:59.696
EXPAND ITS COMMITMENT TO THESE

06:31:59.762 --> 06:32:01.397
PROGRAMS. AND TO THE

06:32:01.464 --> 06:32:03.700
COMMUNITIES THEY SUPPORT. BY

06:32:03.766 --> 06:32:06.736
FIRST PERMANENTLY RESTORING THE

06:32:06.803 --> 06:32:08.705
7% I JUST LAST CAUGHT. THAT WAS

06:32:08.771 --> 06:32:10.340
ENACTED SOLELY FOR BUDGETARY

06:32:10.406 --> 06:32:13.276
REASONS ACROSS THE CLIPBOARD

06:32:13.343 --> 06:32:15.078
CUTS LIKE THIS ARE BAD POLICY.

06:32:15.144 --> 06:32:16.446
THE PANDEMIC SHOWED US IN

06:32:16.512 --> 06:32:18.181
UNMISTAKABLE TERMS THAT PEOPLE

06:32:18.248 --> 06:32:19.883
NEED ROBUST ACCESS TO HOME AND

06:32:19.949 --> 06:32:21.851
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. I

06:32:21.918 --> 06:32:23.653
JUST AS IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR

06:32:23.720 --> 06:32:25.488
EACH CBS SYSTEM AND IT SERVES

06:32:25.555 --> 06:32:27.657
MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY

06:32:27.724 --> 06:32:30.827
THOUSAND PEOPLE ALMOST 70% OF

06:32:30.894 --> 06:32:32.395
WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE

06:32:32.462 --> 06:32:33.329
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ITS

06:32:33.396 --> 06:32:35.565
COMMITMENT HEDIS CRYSTAL CLEAR

06:32:35.632 --> 06:32:36.532
BY REPEALING THE TOP

06:32:36.599 --> 06:32:38.034
PERMANENTLY SO DOES NOT

06:32:38.101 --> 06:32:40.803
CONTINUE TO HANG OVER I JUST AS

06:32:40.870 --> 06:32:42.438
RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS HEADS.

06:32:42.505 --> 06:32:44.674
SECOND WE SHOULD EXPAND ACCESS

06:32:44.741 --> 06:32:46.109
TO ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES

06:32:46.175 --> 06:32:48.778
AND HOME STATE PROGRAM. APS HAS

06:32:48.845 --> 06:32:50.580
BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED

06:32:50.647 --> 06:32:52.282
BUT WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

06:32:52.348 --> 06:32:53.816
TO RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEX AND

06:32:53.883 --> 06:32:54.884
UNIQUE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS

06:32:54.951 --> 06:32:56.986
AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

06:32:57.053 --> 06:32:57.520
AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

06:32:57.587 --> 06:32:59.689
MEETING THOSENEEDS. INCREASING

06:32:59.756 --> 06:33:00.890
FUNDING FOR IT YES IN HOME

06:33:00.957 --> 06:33:02.959
STATE ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO LOWER

06:33:03.026 --> 06:33:03.927
HOMELESSNESS IN THE OLDER ADULT

06:33:03.993 --> 06:33:05.028
COMMUNITY WHICH

06:33:05.094 --> 06:33:06.596
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

06:33:06.663 --> 06:33:08.698
BLACK CALIFORNIANS TO WORK TO

06:33:08.765 --> 06:33:10.633

06:33:10.700 --> 06:33:12.468
EFFECTS OF RACISM AND SEXISM.

06:33:12.535 --> 06:33:15.772
AND EXPANSIVE CORPORATE PEOPLE

06:33:15.838 --> 06:33:16.239
LIVING WITH COGNITIVE

06:33:16.306 --> 06:33:18.174
IMPAIRMENTS. THIRD WE SHOULD

06:33:18.241 --> 06:33:20.476
INCREASE THE SS I SS P. GRANT

06:33:20.543 --> 06:33:21.945

WOMEN BLACK LATIN ACCENT

06:33:26.749 --> 06:33:28.051
IMMIGRANT OLDER ADULTS ARE MORE

06:33:28.117 --> 06:33:30.019
LIKELY TO AGE INTO POVERTY THAN

06:33:30.086 --> 06:33:32.021
WHITE MEN. CALIFORNIANS WHO

IN THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS.

06:33:46.602 --> 06:33:47.937
BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO RAISE

06:33:48.004 --> 06:33:50.006

ENOUGH. IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS

06:34:05.822 --> 06:34:07.323
ONE OF THE LOWEST UPTAKE RATES

06:34:07.390 --> 06:34:08.024

06:37:11.908 --> 06:37:14.010
IT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AS

06:37:14.076 --> 06:37:15.144
WE HEARD EARLIER OFTENTIMES

06:37:15.211 --> 06:37:17.380
CALIBRATION IS NOT ENOUGH- AND

06:37:17.446 --> 06:37:19.048
IT STILL HASN'T REACHED OUT ALL

PROGRAM I APPRECIATE THE

06:37:27.924 --> 06:37:29.258
EARLIER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CHURN

THIS PROGRAM THERE IS NO WAY TO

COME BACK DUE TO THE

06:37:34.664 --> 06:37:36.532
UNFORTUNATE STRUCTURE OF THE

06:37:39.335 --> 06:37:41.504
CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS OFTEN HAVE

06:37:41.571 --> 06:37:42.438

LIFETIME BAR IF THOSE

06:37:52.748 --> 06:37:54.483
CONDITIONS ARE MET AND I THINK

06:37:54.550 --> 06:37:55.718
WE'VE ALL DISCUSSED TODAY THAT

06:37:55.785 --> 06:37:57.353
EVEN SIMPLE PAPERWORK CAN BE A

06:37:57.420 --> 06:37:59.288
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER INCLUDING

06:37:59.355 --> 06:38:01.157

WITH A FEW COMMENTS- A

06:38:58.080 --> 06:38:59.048
NECESSARY CAN SITUATE FROM THE

DISK. BECAUSE REPORTS THE HER

06:39:00.483 --> 06:39:01.884
EX. LIVING ON US. IS VERY TO. I

06:39:01.951 --> 06:39:03.386

SURVIVING EVERY DAY. FOR A LOT

06:39:07.556 --> 06:39:08.691
OF US JUST THE THOUGHT OF

06:39:08.758 --> 06:39:10.459
HAVING TO GO ON A SITE RAISES A

06:39:10.526 --> 06:39:12.028
LOT OF ANXIETY BECAUSE YOU

06:39:12.094 --> 06:39:13.062

PEOPLE SAY RENTS THE MOST

06:39:22.138 --> 06:39:23.506
IMPORTANT THING. BUT IF YOU

06:39:23.572 --> 06:39:24.473

06:42:06.535 --> 06:42:08.370
FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS

06:42:08.437 --> 06:42:11.474

06:42:57.553 --> 06:42:59.188
PART OF RESPONDING TO THE NEXT

06:42:59.255 --> 06:43:01.023
PANDEMIC OR JUST TO THE GROWTH

06:43:01.090 --> 06:43:02.591
OF THE POPULATION IS GOING TO

06:43:02.658 --> 06:43:04.293
REQUIRE SOME OF THESE. CORE

06:43:04.360 --> 06:43:05.895
SERVICES TO BE INTERESTED IN

06:43:05.961 --> 06:43:08.464
BOOK THAT I'M MORE SERIOUSLY

06:43:08.531 --> 06:43:10.099
AND SPEAKING COURSE SERVICES

06:43:10.165 --> 06:43:11.066
YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE OUR

06:43:11.133 --> 06:43:17.206
FAVORITES YOU KNOW. I MENTION-

06:43:17.273 --> 06:43:17.806
AGENCIES ON A SO WE COULD GO

06:43:17.873 --> 06:43:19.475
THROUGH THE BUT REALLY MASS.

06:43:19.542 --> 06:43:21.176
AND I THINK WHAT MASTER PLAN

06:43:21.243 --> 06:43:23.212
FOR AGING- COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF

06:43:23.279 --> 06:43:25.414
WHICH I WAS ONE I RECOGNIZE IS

06:43:25.481 --> 06:43:28.217
THAT. PROBABLY THE MOST

06:43:28.284 --> 06:43:29.718
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE

06:43:29.785 --> 06:43:31.520
PROVIDE THE BASIC NECESSITIES

06:43:31.587 --> 06:43:34.123
OF LIFE THAT WE LOOK AT WAYS TO

06:43:34.189 --> 06:43:36.191
MAKE SURE SENIORS HAVE SHELTER.

06:43:36.258 --> 06:43:38.360
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE FOOD AND

06:43:38.427 --> 06:43:39.795
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS

06:43:39.862 --> 06:43:42.264
TO SERVICES AND ACCESS CAN BE

06:43:42.331 --> 06:43:44.066
INTERPRETED A NUMBER OF WAYS.

06:43:44.133 --> 06:43:45.434
INCLUDES ESSENTIAL

06:43:45.501 --> 06:43:47.369
TRANSPORTATION THAT ALSO

06:43:47.436 --> 06:43:49.305
INCLUDES METHODS BY WHICH TO

06:43:49.371 --> 06:43:51.373
GET INFORMATION OR TO BECOME

06:43:51.440 --> 06:43:53.375
ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES BECAUSE

06:43:53.442 --> 06:43:56.045
THAT'S OUR PART OF. LIFE

06:43:56.111 --> 06:43:58.213
SUSTAINING PROGRAMS WITHOUT

06:43:58.280 --> 06:44:00.482
GOALS ANY OTHER INTERVENTION

06:44:00.549 --> 06:44:02.017
THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

06:44:02.084 --> 06:44:04.887
ATTEMPT IS GOING TO FAIL IT'S

06:44:04.954 --> 06:44:07.389
DOOMED TO FAIL. NAVIGATION OF

06:44:07.456 --> 06:44:09.992
OUR COMPLEX SYSTEM IN MULTIPLE

06:44:10.059 --> 06:44:12.261
FUNDERS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE

06:44:12.328 --> 06:44:15.164
THAT OLDER ADULTS FACE ARM ON

06:44:15.230 --> 06:44:16.065
ONE HAND HOWEVER IT'S

06:44:16.131 --> 06:44:18.300
IMPORTANT. THAT THERE CONTINUE

06:44:18.367 --> 06:44:20.202
TO BE MULTIPLE FOUNDERS WE WANT

06:44:20.269 --> 06:44:22.037
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS TO BE

06:44:22.104 --> 06:44:24.206
INVESTED IN OLDER ADULTS WE

06:44:24.273 --> 06:44:25.908
WANT VETERANS SERVICES TO MAKE

06:44:25.975 --> 06:44:27.443
SURE THE OLDER VETERANS GET

06:44:27.509 --> 06:44:29.178
SIR. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

06:44:29.244 --> 06:44:30.579
THERE'S ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE

06:44:30.646 --> 06:44:32.548
FOR OLDER ADULTS ADEQUATE FOOD

06:44:32.615 --> 06:44:35.384
PROGRAMS THAT THAT AT SANDRA SO

06:44:35.451 --> 06:44:37.519
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LENGTHY

06:44:37.586 --> 06:44:39.254
AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF THESE

06:44:39.321 --> 06:44:42.291
UNFORTUNATELY SILO PROGRAMS

06:44:42.358 --> 06:44:44.760
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO. THE

06:44:44.827 --> 06:44:46.295
PROGRESS WE CAN REALLY MAKE

06:44:46.362 --> 06:44:47.029
THAT I THINK WOULD BE

06:44:47.096 --> 06:44:48.998
SIGNIFICANT IS ADDING AS MUCH

06:44:49.064 --> 06:44:51.467
FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN

06:44:51.533 --> 06:44:53.936
EACH OF THOSE SILOS SO WE DON'T

06:44:54.003 --> 06:44:55.771
CREATE THESE FALSE BARRIERS TO

06:44:55.838 --> 06:44:56.972
SERVICE BECAUSE OF SOME

06:44:57.039 --> 06:44:59.742
REGULATIONS. AND THE WAY WE'RE

06:44:59.808 --> 06:45:02.044
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS IS

06:45:02.111 --> 06:45:03.612
ANOTHER PART OF THE BUDGET

06:45:03.679 --> 06:45:06.649
PROPOSALS THAT I'VE SEEN FOR A

06:45:06.715 --> 06:45:09.652
IS PROMOTING- DIRECTOR WADE

06:45:09.718 --> 06:45:11.120
WERE REFERENCED ONE OF THIS AND

06:45:11.186 --> 06:45:12.554
IT'S HIGHLIGHTED IN MASTER

06:45:12.621 --> 06:45:14.356
PLAN. AND THAT IS THE CREATION

06:45:14.423 --> 06:45:16.859
OF A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM AGING

06:45:16.925 --> 06:45:18.260
AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CAN

06:45:18.327 --> 06:45:19.828
ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

06:45:19.895 --> 06:45:22.965
HAVE PERSON CENTERED SYSTEMS OF

06:45:23.032 --> 06:45:24.700
NAVIGATION THAT WE HAVE

06:45:24.767 --> 06:45:26.702
SOMEBODY TO HELP A PERSON WHO

06:45:26.769 --> 06:45:29.605
NEEDS HELP GET THAT HELP. AND

06:45:29.672 --> 06:45:31.006
FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE

06:45:31.073 --> 06:45:33.108
PERSON RATHER THAN THE NEEDS

06:45:33.175 --> 06:45:34.476
ARE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY

06:45:34.543 --> 06:45:36.945
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM. SO HAVING

06:45:37.012 --> 06:45:38.547
THAT SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY I

06:45:38.614 --> 06:45:39.148
THINK IT'S PART OF OUR

06:45:39.214 --> 06:45:41.283
RECOMMENDATION AND SOMETHING WE

06:45:41.350 --> 06:45:44.953
REALLY WANT. I'M GONNA SKIP TO

06:45:45.020 --> 06:45:46.588
MY LAST QUESTION AND THEN COME

06:45:46.655 --> 06:45:48.757
BACK BRIEFLY TO THE THIRD ONE

06:45:48.824 --> 06:45:50.759
WHICH IS SHOULD WE FIND

06:45:50.826 --> 06:45:53.028
TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SHOULD

06:45:53.095 --> 06:45:57.232
BE FINED- INNOVATIONS. AND THE

06:45:57.299 --> 06:45:58.567
ANSWER IS KIND OF OBVIOUS WE

06:45:58.634 --> 06:46:00.703
WANT TO DO BOTH WE WANT TO FUND

06:46:00.769 --> 06:46:02.371
PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND MAKE

06:46:02.438 --> 06:46:07.810
SURE THEY'RE FOUNDED AND NOW SO.

06:46:07.876 --> 06:46:08.544
THAT THEY CAN WORK BUT ALL ALSO

06:46:08.610 --> 06:46:09.611
LOOK AT. KIND OF SIMPLE THAT WE

06:46:09.678 --> 06:46:11.513
CAN PUT INTO. LONG FRUIT THE

06:46:11.580 --> 06:46:13.882
WERE PART IS FALSE PREVENT. A

06:46:13.949 --> 06:46:15.884
SINGLE FALL ON WITH A BROKEN

06:46:15.951 --> 06:46:18.620
HIP WILL TYPICALLY COST A

06:46:18.687 --> 06:46:20.723
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR

06:46:20.789 --> 06:46:22.191
MEDICAL COSTS AND PERSONAL

06:46:22.257 --> 06:46:24.927
CLASS NOT TO MENTION THE LOSS

06:46:24.993 --> 06:46:25.994
OF RESOURCES FROM FAMILY

06:46:26.061 --> 06:46:27.763
MEMBERS. HAVE TO STEP UP AS

06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:29.765
CARE GIVERS OR THE EMOTIONAL

06:46:29.832 --> 06:46:31.600
LOSS FLOOR ON THE INDIVIDUALS

06:46:31.667 --> 06:46:32.768
AND FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING

06:46:32.835 --> 06:46:33.836
THROUGH THIS EMOTIONAL

06:46:33.902 --> 06:46:35.637
SUFFERING. SO THAT'S ONE

06:46:35.704 --> 06:46:36.638
PROPOSAL WE WANT TO LOOK

06:46:36.705 --> 06:46:38.474
FORWARD RIGHT NOW WE THINK THAT

06:46:38.540 --> 06:46:40.275
IT IS WELL WITH MASTER PLAN FOR

06:46:40.342 --> 06:46:44.012
REACHING. ARM IN REVISITING

06:46:44.079 --> 06:46:45.547
HEALTHCARE. AND THEN LET HOW DO

06:46:45.614 --> 06:46:48.050
WE AFFORD ALL THIS BECAUSE NONE

06:46:48.117 --> 06:46:50.085
OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE FREE. HOW

06:46:50.152 --> 06:46:52.087
MAY MAY BE CHEAP BUT THEY'RE

06:46:52.154 --> 06:46:54.490
NOT FREE SO I THINK THERE'S TWO

06:46:54.556 --> 06:46:56.458
PIECES ABOUT THE FIRST ONE IS

06:46:56.525 --> 06:46:58.327
THAT WE LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT

06:46:58.393 --> 06:47:01.663
WILL COST US. TO CONTINUE THE

06:47:01.730 --> 06:47:03.499
SERVICES THAT ARE ARE MANDATED

06:47:03.565 --> 06:47:05.901
TO BE PROVIDED. AS THE

06:47:05.968 --> 06:47:07.636
POPULATION AGES AND WE COULD

06:47:07.703 --> 06:47:09.304
JUST DO SOME SIMPLE MATH AROUND

06:47:09.371 --> 06:47:11.306
THAT AND CALCULATE HOW MANY

06:47:11.373 --> 06:47:13.408
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE GOING TO

06:47:13.475 --> 06:47:15.244
BE NEEDED AS THE POPULATION.

06:47:15.310 --> 06:47:17.412
DOUBLES ON AND THEN LOOK AT

06:47:17.479 --> 06:47:19.148
WHAT THAT NUMBER IS AND REALLY

06:47:19.214 --> 06:47:21.917
PLAN AROUND WHAT'S THE BEST USE

06:47:21.984 --> 06:47:23.786
OF THOSE DOLLARS IT IS A TO

06:47:23.852 --> 06:47:26.388
CONTINUE AS WE'RE DOING NOW. OR

06:47:26.455 --> 06:47:28.390
THERE'S SOME INNOVATIONS OUT

06:47:28.457 --> 06:47:28.957
THERE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT

06:47:29.024 --> 06:47:30.893
WHICH WOULD IMPROVE BOTH

06:47:30.959 --> 06:47:34.329
QUALITY OF LIFE AND- DECREASE

06:47:34.396 --> 06:47:36.565
THE COSTS. IN THAT CAN LEADS TO

06:47:36.632 --> 06:47:38.200
MY FINAL COMMENT THAT WE SHOULD

06:47:38.267 --> 06:47:40.669
ALWAYS BE ASKING IS NOT JUST

06:47:40.736 --> 06:47:42.437
WHAT'S THE COST OF PROVIDING

06:47:42.504 --> 06:47:44.773
SERVICE. BUT WHAT'S THE COST OF

06:47:44.840 --> 06:47:46.909
NOT PROVIDING SERVICE WHAT

06:47:46.975 --> 06:47:50.879
HAPPENS IF WE DON'T DO

06:47:50.946 --> 06:47:52.514
ANYTHING. AND HI. FAR WILL

06:47:52.581 --> 06:47:55.184
CLASS ESCALATES ON BOTH THE

06:47:55.250 --> 06:47:56.585
FINANCIAL SIDE OF THINGS BUT

06:47:56.652 --> 06:48:00.722
ALSO THE HUMAN. ASPECTS SO THAT

06:48:00.789 --> 06:48:03.492

FOURTEEN COUNTIES WE CURRENTLY

06:53:45.200 --> 06:53:48.403
DO NOT SERVE. MSSP IS A PROVEN

COST EFFECTIVE MODEL OF CARE

06:53:49.771 --> 06:53:50.839

06:55:45.120 --> 06:55:46.588
PART OF A SEAMLESS CONTINUUM OF

STREAMLINED INTEGRATED SYSTEM

EQUITABLE CHARGE FORWARD RELIES

06:56:34.402 --> 06:56:36.071
ON BETTER DATA SYSTEMS THAT

BETTER PICTURE OF THE NEED

06:56:56.124 --> 06:56:58.059
ACROSS THE SYSTEM IT WILL BE

06:56:58.126 --> 06:57:01.363
HARD TO TARGET RESOURCES IN AN

WHAT THE AUDITOR STATED AND-

07:02:17.111 --> 07:02:19.614
THE LACK OF INFORMATION WE HAVE

07:02:19.681 --> 07:02:23.017

PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE

LAST YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THERE

07:02:37.098 --> 07:02:39.200

ASSISTANCE WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING

07:02:52.880 --> 07:02:54.015
FROM THE STATE HAS BEEN A KEY

07:02:54.082 --> 07:02:55.249
COMPONENT OF FACT THAT

RECIPIENTS AS THEY BECOME

07:03:32.920 --> 07:03:38.025
ELIGIBLE I THINK THAT IT WAS-

07:03:38.092 --> 07:03:41.028
SOME MIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

07:03:41.095 --> 07:03:44.265
THE- PARTICULAR. LAND THAT'S

07:03:44.332 --> 07:03:45.266
BEING REFERRED TO BY THE

07:03:45.333 --> 07:03:50.404
AUDITOR IS REALLY AN OLD ARM.

07:03:50.471 --> 07:03:53.541
AN OLD PLANNING TOOL THAT WAS

07:03:53.608 --> 07:03:55.710
UTILIZED WHEN THEY COUNTIES

07:03:55.777 --> 07:03:57.945
WERE ACTUALLY USING HOMEMAKERS

07:03:58.012 --> 07:04:01.048
AND COUNTY STAFF WERE- THE

07:04:01.115 --> 07:04:03.117
PROVIDERS OF SERVICE THE WAY

07:04:03.184 --> 07:04:04.919
THAT WE DO PLANNING NOW AND THE

07:04:04.986 --> 07:04:06.420
WAY THAT WE WORK WITH THE

07:04:06.487 --> 07:04:08.322
COUNTIES AND ENSURING THAT

07:04:08.389 --> 07:04:11.325
RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS ARE.

07:04:11.392 --> 07:04:13.161
CONNECTED AND THAT SERVICES ARE

07:04:13.227 --> 07:04:15.797
BEING PROVIDED IS A DIFFERENT

07:04:15.863 --> 07:04:17.265
PROCESS NOT THAT ONE DOESN'T

07:04:17.331 --> 07:04:19.700
EXIST AT ALL AND SO THAT IS A

07:04:19.767 --> 07:04:21.369
CRITICAL THING THAT COUNTIES

07:04:21.435 --> 07:04:23.471
WORK ON REGULARLY AND THAT WE

07:04:23.538 --> 07:04:27.608
WORK WITH THEM ON ENSURING IT

07:04:27.675 --> 07:04:29.343
IS HAPPENING. SO HOPE THAT

07:04:29.410 --> 07:04:31.712
HELPS I'M I'M MAY MOVE US ON

07:04:31.779 --> 07:04:34.715
AND- ASK NOW IF I CAN ABOUT THE

07:04:34.782 --> 07:04:36.317
AUTOMATED TERMINATIONS THAT ARE

07:04:36.384 --> 07:04:39.086
OCCURRING FOR HIGH HSS WANNA.

07:04:39.153 --> 07:04:40.521
REDETERMINATION IS NOT

07:04:40.588 --> 07:04:46.661

07:04:46.727 --> 07:04:48.095
FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE HAD AN

07:04:48.162 --> 07:04:49.997
AUTOMATIC TERMINATION WHEN SHE

07:04:50.064 --> 07:04:52.200
WAS IN AN I SEE YOU GOING

07:04:52.266 --> 07:04:54.669
THROUGH- CRITICAL MOMENT BEFORE

07:04:54.735 --> 07:04:56.971
SHE PASSED. AND IT WAS HARD FOR

07:04:57.038 --> 07:04:58.472
US AS A FAMILY TO RECEIVE THE

07:04:58.539 --> 07:05:00.141
AUTOMATIC TERMINATION FOR HER

07:05:00.208 --> 07:05:02.109
NOT COMPLETING THE PAPERWORK

07:05:02.176 --> 07:05:04.412
WHILE SHE WAS- GOING THROUGH

07:05:04.478 --> 07:05:05.813
THAT AND SO I'M TRYING TO

07:05:05.880 --> 07:05:08.516
UNDERSTAND PREVALENT THIS IS

07:05:08.583 --> 07:05:11.853
THIS SOMETHING THAT WE. CAN YOU

07:05:11.919 --> 07:05:13.487
SPEAK TO WHY WE HAVE THE

07:05:13.554 --> 07:05:14.922
NECESSITY FOR THE AUTOMATIC

07:05:14.989 --> 07:05:18.192
TERMINATION. SO CURRENTLY

07:05:18.259 --> 07:05:19.126
ACTUALLY THE AUTOMATED

07:05:19.193 --> 07:05:22.063
TERMINATION IS NOT IN PLACE. IT

07:05:22.129 --> 07:05:24.532
IS NOT IN POLICY AND DOES

07:05:24.599 --> 07:05:28.369
HAPPEN TO COUNTY- PROCESSES

07:05:28.436 --> 07:05:30.271
ALREADY SO IT'S NOT A NEW

07:05:30.338 --> 07:05:32.506
POLICY AND WHAT IT REALLY IS

07:05:32.573 --> 07:05:35.142
DRIVEN BY IS MEDIKAL

07:05:35.209 --> 07:05:37.678
ELIGIBILITY AND IT REALLY HAS

07:05:37.745 --> 07:05:41.849
TO DO WITH- EIGHT. ALIGNING IT

07:05:41.916 --> 07:05:44.585
TO SILENCE AND MEDIKAL SO THAT

07:05:44.652 --> 07:05:47.488
WHEN MEDICARE WAS TERMINATED AS

07:05:47.555 --> 07:05:49.457
EVERY OTHER I AM MEDICAL

07:05:49.523 --> 07:05:51.893
BENEFIT IT OCCURS THAT THAT

07:05:51.959 --> 07:05:55.630
BENEFIT IS ALSO I'M NOT

07:05:55.696 --> 07:06:00.134
AVAILABLE WHAT WE REALLY ARM

07:06:00.201 --> 07:06:02.737
HAVE FOUND AND I'VE- WORKED IN

07:06:02.803 --> 07:06:03.871
THIS PROGRAM IN THE COUNTY FOR

07:06:03.938 --> 07:06:07.608
MANY MANY YEARS ALSO. AND WHAT

07:06:07.675 --> 07:06:10.578
WHAT HAPPENS IS OFTENTIMES THE

07:06:10.645 --> 07:06:15.983
LOSE MEDIC HOW AND NOT- AND NOT

07:06:16.050 --> 07:06:17.952
BE AWARE OF IT WHEREAS A

07:06:18.019 --> 07:06:19.720
OFTENTIMES WHEN THEY GET I HSS

07:06:19.787 --> 07:06:21.989
NOTICES THEY BECOME AWARE THAT

07:06:22.056 --> 07:06:22.924
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED WITH

07:06:22.990 --> 07:06:24.492
PARAMEDIC HOUSE AND THAT

07:06:24.558 --> 07:06:26.627
ACTUALLY PROVIDES AN

07:06:26.694 --> 07:06:29.730
OPPORTUNITY- TO RECONNECT THEM

07:06:29.797 --> 07:06:31.532
WITH MEDIC COW BECAUSE WITH I

07:06:31.599 --> 07:06:32.733
JUST AS THERE IS A SOCIAL

07:06:32.800 --> 07:06:35.002
WORKER THERE IS COUNTY STAFF

07:06:36.504 --> 07:06:39.173
FACILITATE THAT PROCESS THE

07:06:39.240 --> 07:06:41.275
INTENT IS TO GET PEOPLE BACK ON

07:06:41.342 --> 07:06:42.944

THEIR MEDIC HOW RATHER THAN

07:06:52.553 --> 07:06:55.089
REQUIRE- THE CURRENT PROCESS

07:06:55.156 --> 07:06:56.590
WHICH IS MANUAL THAT WHEN THEY

07:06:56.657 --> 07:06:59.160
RE ESTABLISH. THE IT REQUIRES

07:06:59.226 --> 07:07:00.695
THE COUNTY TO TAKE AN ACTION TO

07:07:00.761 --> 07:07:02.196
REESTABLISH THEIR AYE IT JUST

07:07:02.263 --> 07:07:04.498
SUCKS SO WE HOPE THAT THAT ON

07:07:04.565 --> 07:07:07.001
MATT NATION WILL ALSO SUPPORT

07:07:07.068 --> 07:07:11.605

THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER BUT I

07:07:14.408 --> 07:07:16.110
STILL BELIEVE THERE IS A BIT OF

07:07:16.177 --> 07:07:18.145
CONFUSION AND SO I MAY ASK FOR

OF- ANALYSIS. TO DETERMINE THE

07:09:29.276 --> 07:09:31.712
BEST APPROACH TO INCLUDING

07:09:31.779 --> 07:09:34.014
DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH C. STARK

07:09:34.081 --> 07:09:37.451

MANY MANY YEARS IT WAS A

07:09:45.793 --> 07:09:48.229
STRAIGHT SPLIT UP THE PROGRAM

07:09:48.295 --> 07:09:51.332
COSTS BETWEEN. THAT THE FEDS

07:09:51.398 --> 07:09:52.967
AND THEN THE REMAINING SHARE

07:09:53.033 --> 07:09:55.336
BEING SPLIT SIXTY FIVE THIRTY

07:09:55.402 --> 07:09:56.704
FIVE BETWEEN THAT STATE AND THE

07:09:56.770 --> 07:09:59.673
COUNTIES- IN TWO THOUSAND

07:09:59.740 --> 07:10:00.174
TWELVE WE BEGAN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND BACK

07:10:02.877 --> 07:10:07.681
THEN WAS REPEAT RE BASED IN TWO

07:10:07.748 --> 07:10:08.449
THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THEN.

07:10:08.516 --> 07:10:11.285
REVIEWED AGAIN- AS A PART OF

07:10:11.352 --> 07:10:12.386
THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

07:10:12.453 --> 07:10:14.088
PROCESS THERE WAS THE AND OUT

07:10:14.155 --> 07:10:16.290
THE- REQUIREMENT TO DO AN

07:10:16.357 --> 07:10:19.760
ANALYSIS FOR THAT- REALIGNMENTS

07:10:19.827 --> 07:10:22.062
FUNDING AND TO LOOK AT THAT.

07:10:22.129 --> 07:10:24.765
AND THAT THEN THE NEW ARE

07:10:24.832 --> 07:10:25.799
NINETEEN TWENTY WAS IMPLEMENTED

07:10:25.866 --> 07:10:28.802
THE MOST RECENT MLB- THAT

07:10:28.869 --> 07:10:31.172

DATA OUR SWITCH- TO A SIXTY

07:10:44.652 --> 07:10:47.288
FIVE COUNTY THIRTY FIVE STATE-

07:10:47.354 --> 07:10:50.391
AND IT ALSO REMOVED THE

07:10:50.457 --> 07:10:53.027
PARTICIPATION CAP. SO THAT THE

STATE WILL PARTICIPATE IN

07:10:55.996 --> 07:10:57.131
ANYTHING THAT'S BARGAINED BY

THERE ARE A LOT OF CROSS OVER A

07:11:30.965 --> 07:11:31.966
CROSS CUTTING ISSUES THEY HAD

07:11:32.032 --> 07:11:33.567
DIFFERENT AREAS AND THIS

07:11:33.634 --> 07:11:34.802

07:12:09.370 --> 07:12:10.571
REGARDING A FEW OF THE THINGS

07:12:10.638 --> 07:12:11.905
WE JUST SPOKE WITH THE

07:12:11.972 --> 07:12:13.741

COMMENTS ON THAT ON THAT

07:12:24.918 --> 07:12:26.987
PROPOSAL. WE THINK THIS

07:12:27.054 --> 07:12:28.522
PROPOSAL NEEDS SIGNIFICANT WORK

07:12:28.589 --> 07:12:30.491
IF IT'S CONSIDERED AN ALL IN

07:12:30.557 --> 07:12:31.425
PARTICULAR THE IDEA THAT A

07:12:31.492 --> 07:12:32.926
PERSON LOSING THAT ACCOUNTS AND

07:12:32.993 --> 07:12:34.862
ALSO AUTOMATICALLY LOSE AYE TO

07:12:36.964 --> 07:12:40.167
AFTER THEY ARE PUT BACK ON TO

07:12:40.234 --> 07:12:41.869
THE SYSTEM OF MEDIC HEALTH IS

07:12:41.935 --> 07:12:42.770
HIGHLY INEQUITABLE TERM

07:12:42.836 --> 07:12:45.472
RECIPIENTS AND WOULD RESULT IN

07:12:45.539 --> 07:12:46.607
A LOSS OF SERVICES. OUR

BEING IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY.

07:12:49.677 --> 07:12:51.345
REMEMBER OUR RECIPIENTS MUST

07:12:51.412 --> 07:12:53.514
MEET AND INCOME TAX TO QUALIFY

07:12:53.580 --> 07:12:54.515
FOR THE SERVICES THEY ARE NOT

07:12:54.581 --> 07:12:56.450
WELL OFF. THE IDEA THAT THEY

07:12:56.517 --> 07:12:57.718
COULD SOMEHOW COME UP WITH

07:12:57.785 --> 07:12:59.086
FUNDS TO PAY PROVIDERS IN THE

07:12:59.153 --> 07:13:02.456
TIME BETWEEN A MEDICAL

THINKING AND SO THAT SOME OF

07:13:06.293 --> 07:13:07.928
THE IDEA THAT A PROVIDER. CAN

07:13:07.995 --> 07:13:09.563
CONTINUE WORKING FOR FREE IN

07:13:09.630 --> 07:13:11.065
THE HOPE THAT THE RECIPIENT

HAVE TO GO FIND ANOTHER

BEFORE THAT PERSON IS

07:13:25.746 --> 07:13:27.247
REINSTATED. AT A MINIMUM WE

07:13:27.314 --> 07:13:28.849
COULD SAY IF THIS IS

07:13:28.916 --> 07:13:30.517
CONSIDERED. RECIPIENTS SHOULD

SERVICES FOR A MUCH LONGER

07:13:33.354 --> 07:13:35.022
GRACE PERIOD. THE NAVY

07:13:35.089 --> 07:13:37.224
CONTEMPLATED. FOR OUR WE'VE

07:13:37.291 --> 07:13:38.826
BEEN TALKING EARLIER RIGHT THAT

07:13:38.892 --> 07:13:40.561

REINSTATED AFTER DISCONTINUING

07:13:44.264 --> 07:13:46.667
SO THEY MAY BE DISCONTINUED AND

07:13:46.734 --> 07:13:47.768
THREE MONTHS LATER THEY COME

07:13:47.835 --> 07:13:49.503
BACK IN. WITH THE INFORMATION

07:13:49.570 --> 07:13:51.038
THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE-

07:13:51.105 --> 07:13:53.540
MOST OFTEN IT IS THAT. FAILURE

07:13:53.607 --> 07:13:55.609
TO PROVIDE A DOCUMENT OR SOME

07:13:55.676 --> 07:13:57.177

COUNTIES ARE THEN HELP THEM GET

PERIOD OF TIME FOR THEM TO BE

07:14:09.757 --> 07:14:12.693
REINSTATED AGAIN IF WE EVEN IF

07:14:12.760 --> 07:14:14.094

GOING FORTH WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

07:14:16.063 --> 07:14:21.668
I THINK THE L. A. O. DOES. I

07:14:21.735 --> 07:14:24.138
WAS. PRETTY NEW STAFFER AT

07:14:24.204 --> 07:14:27.141
CEDAR BDA WHEN WE BEGAN TO

07:14:27.207 --> 07:14:28.876
REFINANCE THE ITEMS THAT'S

07:14:28.942 --> 07:14:30.577
PROGRAM WHICH AT THAT TIME. WAS

07:14:30.644 --> 07:14:31.945
STILL RELATIVELY SMALL BUT HAD

07:14:32.012 --> 07:14:34.081
STARTED TO GROW ESPECIALLY AS A

07:14:34.148 --> 07:14:35.983
RESULT OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR

07:14:36.049 --> 07:14:37.951
COUNTIES TO DO THE COLLECTIVE

07:14:38.018 --> 07:14:39.920
BARGAINING WITH OUR- ITEMS

07:14:39.987 --> 07:14:43.056
THAT'S PROVIDERS. AND SO- AS A

07:14:43.123 --> 07:14:44.825
STATE EVERYONE BE KIND OF YOU

07:14:44.892 --> 07:14:46.460
KNOW KIND OF BEGAN LOOKING

07:14:46.527 --> 07:14:48.429
AROUND. AND SO WAS OVER TIME IN

07:14:48.495 --> 07:14:49.997
A NUMBER OF CHUNKS THAT WE RE

07:14:50.063 --> 07:14:52.166
AND YOU KNOW WE FINANCED THE

07:14:52.232 --> 07:14:53.167
PROGRAM TO THE FEDERAL

07:14:53.233 --> 07:14:54.868
GOVERNMENT. AND THE RESIDUAL

07:14:54.935 --> 07:14:57.404
PROGRAM WAS WHAT WAS LEFT- UP

07:14:57.471 --> 07:14:59.506
UNTIL THIS POINT. I'VE NEVER

07:14:59.573 --> 07:15:01.408
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEING-

07:15:01.475 --> 07:15:02.810
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T JUST

07:15:02.876 --> 07:15:04.378
MOVE PEOPLE INTO IF THEY WERE

07:15:04.445 --> 07:15:05.612
FASTER MEDICARE I'LL- AND THEN

07:15:05.679 --> 07:15:07.114

07:15:07.181 --> 07:15:08.315
MOVE THEM BACK INTO THE REGULAR

07:15:08.382 --> 07:15:09.983

07:15:12.152 --> 07:15:13.487

07:15:14.555 --> 07:15:15.622

07:15:31.238 --> 07:15:31.939

THE TIME. TO CUT PEOPLE OFF

07:15:34.041 --> 07:15:35.375

NINETY EIGHT. COSTS WERE FUNDED

07:17:34.094 --> 07:17:35.062
AT TWO. THREE THOUSAND AND ONE

07:17:35.128 --> 07:17:36.763
STAFF CLASS LEVELS. MORE THAN

07:17:36.830 --> 07:17:38.298
FIFTEEN YEARS BEHIND THE ACTUAL
