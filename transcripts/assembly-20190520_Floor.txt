UCLA A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ACTUALLY CAME INTO EXISTENCE. UNDER INCREDIBLE ODDS. AND IT WAS A RISKY ENDEAVOR FOR IT TO COME INTO EXISTENCE IT WAS FIGHTING A LOT OF OPPOSITION. FROM BOTH THE UC REGENTS. AND IT'S NORTHERN CAL RIVAL. THE SCHOOL WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED TO BERKELEY. AND YET IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY -- DECIDED THAT UCLA COULD BECOME ONE OF OUR UC SCHOOLS. IT WAS A TWO YEAR COLLEGE AND IT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GRANT DEGREES. AND NOW A HUNDRED YEARS LATER. US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT RANKS IT NUMBER ONE AS A TOP UNIVERSITY IN THE NATION. IT RECEIVES OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND YEAH. IT RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS EACH YEAR. FROM ALL OF THE FIFTY STATES AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE COUNTRIES.

SEES THE NATIONAL CHAMPION IN FOOTBALL YOU SALES NATIONAL CHAMPION BASKETBALL AND EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY'S GONNA HATE IS ALL. MR THIS AREA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- I JUST WANT I HAD VERY FEW WORDS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE BUT I COULDN'T HELP. NOTICING THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM A DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES MADE.

BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT FUNDING CONTINUOUSLY COMES TO THE TO CALIFORNIA AND TO THE SOUTH LAND. NOW THAT SAID I JUST WANTED TO NOT SURE IF -- THE WONDERFUL GENTLE LADY FROM. OF LOS ANGELES WHO INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION SPOKE ABOUT THE ELEVEN BILLION ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION THAT ALL THE UC'S CONTRIBUTE. AND NOW FOR BILLION OF IT COMES FROM UCLA BUT JUST AS ECONOMIC ENGINE HUBS IT'S VERY CRITICAL FOR US TO LOOK AT THE UC'S AS WELL AS ARE OTHERS. ARE ARE CSU STATE SCHOOLS BUT ESPECIALLY THE UC'S GIVEN THEIR RESEARCH CAPABILITY THAT THEY NOT ONLY PROVIDE JOBS NOT ONLY ARE THEY INVESTMENTS FOR THE FUTURE BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE DRIVERS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CONTRIBUTE. GREATLY TO NOT ONLY MEETING OUR NEEDS IN THE STATE IN HEALTHCARE EDUCATION WHEREVER CUT WHEREVER THEY'RE A RESEARCH LEADS BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THE DRY THEY ARE THE ECONOMIC ENGINES. AND DRIVERS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT THEN GETS USED WORLDWIDE AND BRINGS ATTENTION AND ACCOLADES TO THE STATE SO FOR THAT.

AND THAT WITHOUT QUESTION IT IS THE BEST PUBLIC SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND AND THE SECOND BEST SCHOOL IN THE PAC TWELVE NEXT TO STANFORD GO BRUINS [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT UCLA HAS SEVEN GRADUATES WHO HAVE WON NOBEL PRIZES. AND USC HAS. NINE THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I I TO RISE A DAY IN SUPPORT OF HR THIRTY SEVEN RECOGNIZING MAY TWENTY THIRD. TWENTY NINETEEN AS A HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF UCLA'S FOUNDING. AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM LOS ANGELES AND FROM S. C.. OF FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FOR AND I'M PROUD CO AUTHOR OF IT. UNLIKE SOME OF YOU -- I DON'T SIT AROUND AND TALK ABOUT THE BRUINS AND THE ESEE FOLKS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M A I'M A HIGH I'M IN A HIGHER IT EDUCATOR. AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE EXCELLENT AND ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF EDUCATION EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF YOU BECAUSE I'M A TRIPLE BREWING. I HAVE A BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S AND A PHD FROM UCLA. AND RECEIVE THEM. RECEIVE THEM BOTH BY THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND I SAY THAT PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I WAS SOME PRODIGY CHILD. BUT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF UCLA. NOT THE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AND ALL THOSE THINGS WE GET CAUGHT UP IN. BUT THE FACT THAT THIS STATE DECIDED TO DEVELOP THE UNIVERSITY IS A CALIFORNIA. TO BE A COUNTER TO THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN COULDN'T AFFORD. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE S. SEASON WE HAVE THE STAMFORD TO WE HAVE THOSE PLACES BUT THEY WERE ALL DESIGNED FOR THE ELITE. AND SO CALIFORNIA DECIDED IN ITS WISDOM TO DEVELOP A UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THAT WOULD BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. TO PROVIDE AN EDUCATION FOR THE EVERY CHILD AND WHEN YOU READ THE PREAMBLE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YOU SEE THAT THAT THAT IT'S IT'S MISSION. AND I TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT BEING A POOR KID FROM SOUTH CENTRAL LA. THAT I COULD GO TO ONE OF THE FINEST INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD. GET DEGREES FROM THAT INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OPEN DOORS FOR ME THAT I HAD NEVER IMAGINED MYSELF. AND THAT IS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE LA IS ABOUT THAT IT REALLY GIVES EVERY CALIFORNIANS EVERY CHILD OPPORTUNITY TO BE EXCELLENT. THAT IS TRULY THE AMERICAN EQUALIZER. AND CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. AND THE FACT THAT ONE OF ITS INSTITUTIONS UCLA ALONG OBVIOUSLY WOULD BERKELEY AS WELL AS REALLY DISTINGUISH ITSELF NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA. BUT AROUND THE WORLD WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD. AND WE SHOULD BE VERY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING OUR INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR THE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. I TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT I HAVE THREE DEGREES WHEN YOU SEE A WAY. AND I GRADUATED OWING A DEBT OF TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT'S UCLA. THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR SO THAT WE DON'T END UP IN IN DEBT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A LIFE AND IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO WORK. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT WE SEE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING TODAY. MOST OF US PROBABLY SAW THE WHAT HAPPENED AND MORE HOUSES WEEKEND. WHEN ONE OF OUR BLACK BILLIONAIRES DECIDED TO CANCEL THE DEBT OF EVERY STUDENT WHO IS A GRADUATE OF MOREHOUSE OVER FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS? WHAT A GIFT WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO BASICALLY BEGIN TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? SO I CELEBRATE THE HUNDRED YEARS OF UCLA AS A GREAT INSTITUTION AND YOU CAN READ ABOUT ALL OF ITS NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS YOU CAN READ ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT IS DONE ALL OF ITS RESEARCH GRANTS ALL OF ITS IN DOWN MIX. ALL THAT STUFF IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. BUT IN THE END IT BOILS DOWN TO BE. A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE PUEBLOS OF LOS ANGELES WHO LIVED IN THE PROJECTS. WHO WENT TO SCHOOL DADDY TOLD HE WOULD DRINK MUDDY WATER AND SLEEP IN A HOLLOW LOG IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL? MAKING A COMMITMENT TO HER TO BE EXCELLENT. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BEFORE THERE WAS ANY PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT ADMITTED ME TO THE INSTITUTION. WITH A BIT WITH THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS THAT BEEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO GO TO SCHOOL FROM ONE DEGREE TO THE NEXT. AND END UP AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR ONE OF THE WOODROW WILSON FELLOWS AT THE TIME. AND TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR FORTY YEARS AND BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK TO CALIFORNIA WHAT IT IS GIVEN TO ME. THAT IS UCLA THAT IS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT IS WHAT WE DREAM ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT WE CELEBRATE TODAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THAT THE WEBER. I WOULD JUST REQUEST THAT WE REFRAIN FROM. APERTURE APPLAUSE DURING DEBATE ON AN ITEM BEFORE THIS HOUSE MR SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU WANT. TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION UP AND CHALLENGE SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF IT MADE BECAUSE THE BEST THING ABOUT THE RIVALRY RIVALRY AND LOS ANGELES IS THAT UCLA'S A BETTER SCHOOL. HANDS DOWN NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND WHAT ONE SCHOOL ACHIEVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS WE'VE WAITED SIR PASSED AND LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SO ON BEHALF OF THE SEVEN NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNERS. WE HAVE ALL THE ALONE NICE ALL THE ALUMS HERE ON THE ON THE FLOOR WE WANT TO REQUEST THE STRONG BY THIS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE RESOLUTION MS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES -- FOR RISING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF UCLA THOSE WHO ARE ALARM OF UCLA MY FELLOW TROJANS AND THOSE WHO'VE GONE TO OTHER SCHOOLS -- I STARTED BY SAYING. UCLA CAME INTO EXISTENCE. AGAINST A NUMBER OF ODDS AND IT TOOK RISKS TO PUSH BEYOND THE RESISTANCE TO BE CALM THE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL. THAT IT IS TODAY AND IT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE RISKS TO STAY NUMBER ONE AS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. IT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ENROLL MORE. IT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO GRADUATE MORE. ALL WHILE FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE COSTS WITH OUT SACRIFICING ITS EXCELLENCE AND I KNOW THAT THAT CAN BE DONE AND BASED ON THE DEBATE ON THE FLOOR FOR THIS RESOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL WILL HELP UCLA CONTINUE TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. HR THIRTY SEVEN IS CERTAINLY ABOUT CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF UCLA BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT RE COMMITTING OURSELVES TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE MASTER PLAN OF EDUCATION. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE PUBLIC EDUCATION HIGH QUALITY. ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE. THROUGH K. THROUGH TWELVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE. WE WERE THE GOLDEN STATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. MOST OF WHICH WE WERE SUPPORTING WERE PUBLIC. WE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO MOVE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM OUR COMMITMENT TO THE MASTER PLAN. AND ONCE AGAIN I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS AS A TROJAN TURN BRO GIN BUT I AM URGING ALL. TO VOTE I ON HR THIRTY SEVEN AND TO WORK WITH ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING OUR PUBLIC. INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING A PRIORITY THANK YOU.

MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR FARES WE THINK ABOUT THE RIDES THE GAME SO HORSE RACING AND THE DELICIOUS FOOD. HOWEVER. AND I DO MEAN HOWEVER ARE SEVENTY EIGHT FAIRS MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAN FRIED OREOS AND ROLLER COASTERS. FAIR GROUNDS PROVIDE A CRUCIAL OPEN SPACE FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SITUATIONS. THEY ARE VITAL STAGING AREAS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS DURING EMERGENCIES. THEY ARE UTILIZED AS SAFE HAVEN DURING A CATASTROPHIC DISASTER SUCH AS A WILDFIRE AND EARTHQUAKES. OUR LOCAL FAIRS ARE WHERE WE IN OUR YOUTH PREPARE TO BECOMETHE NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS RANCHERS. AND EVEN CREATIVE ARTISTS MY FRIENDS. OUTSIDE OF OUR SUMMER FARES THESE FAIRGROUNDS HOST CHARITY EVENTS CONCERTS COMPETITIVE EXHIBITS AND CULTURAL EVENTS ALONG WITH MANY WEDDINGS. HELD OVER A SEVENTEEN DAY PERIOD THE DAILY ATTENDANCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR LAST YEAR RANGE FROM 200-002-60000 PEOPLE PER DAY. OUR FAIRGROUNDS BENEFIT THE LOCAL ECONOMIES CREATE A RIPPLE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OPPORTUNITY FOR TOURISM DOLLARS FOR THE STATE. LAST YEAR FAIR GORE SPENT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON FOOD AND DRINKS ALONE. FAIRS ALSO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR OUR MILITARY AND THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN. LAST YEAR THE NAVY WAS HONORED THAT FOR THE FIRST FULL WEEK OF LAST YEAR STATE FAIR. MEMBERS THESE FACILITIES ARE WHERE WE MAKE CHERISHED MEMORIES. WE MUST ENSURE OUR FAIRGROUNDS RECEIVE THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. I STRONGLY URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO ATTEND THEIR LOCAL FAIRS THIS SEASON AND ENJOY ALL THAT THE FAIR GROUNDS HAVE TO OFFER. MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU.

BY THE AMOUNT OF TAX BASE THAT FAIRS ACTUALLY GENERATE TO AS SALES TAX TO THE STATE FUNDS IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE ACTUALLY SPENT ON FAIRS -- SO -- I WOULD LIKE THAT KEEP THAT MINE IS LEGISLATORS LOOK AT THE BUDGET.
