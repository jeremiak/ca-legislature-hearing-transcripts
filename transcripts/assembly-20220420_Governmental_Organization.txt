WHEN IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT PRES PLUS ONE THEN ZERO OF ME YOURSELVES IN ORDER TO SPEAK BE BRIEF LIMITING YOUR COMMENTS TO YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. WITH THAT- WE WILL BEGIN- IN THE- SUB. AND ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY WOULD BE THAT MR CHOI WILL BE SUBSTITUTING FOR MR BIGELOW AS VICE CHAIR TODAY. AND I WOULD WE HAVE ONE OTHER HERE MISTER CORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN THANK YES THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I ACCEPT TE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHAT THE AMENDMENTS DO IS SIMPLY MAKE SURE. THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE ALCOHOL AND- CANNABIS AT THE SAME EVENT THAT IS. STILL CONTINUES TO BE THE STATE LAW. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GRANT A TEMPORARY LICENSE FOR THE SALE OF CANNABIS AB DE PERMITTED MENUS. UP SOME OF THOSE MENUS A BIT VENUES HAVE BEEN DENIED CANNABIS RETAIL LICENSES BECAUSE THE- OUR VENUE HAS AN ABC LICENSE. AND THEREFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD IT WHAT THIS BILL DOES ALLOW US TO DO IS TO SUSPEND THAT THE- THE LOCATION COULD SUSPEND THAT ABC LICENSE ARE FOR THE PURITY OF THE EVENT UP UNTIL SIX IN THE AM OF THE NEXT DAY. IN THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW THAT VENUE TO HAVE THE OF THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THEY WOULD BE SELLING ALCOHOL SO THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN. DOT CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IT ALSO CLARIFIES PROVISIONS FOR SPECIAL EVENT LOCATIONS. ARE THAT WISH TO OBTAIN LICENSES TO SELL CANNABIS TEMPORARILY. OUR THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW CANNABIS LICENSES TO. ALL LICENSEES SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU BRING CANNABIS TO ADVANCE. YOU HAVE TO THROW AWAY WHAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DON'T USE. OF WHAT WE WOULD SAY HERE IS PROVIDING YOU COULD GET IN THE STATE'S TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. SO IT'S TRACKED AND TRACED UNTIL IT COMES TO THAT LOCATION. IF YOU CAN GET IT IN THE STATE SYSTEM TRACK AND TRACE AS YOU BRING IT BACK HOME. THEN EVERYTHING'S FINE YOU CAN SELL IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO- DESTROY UNUSED INVENTORY- REDUCES IMPORTANT. THE LET'S COLLEGES SUPER RECYCLING. I WITH ME TODAY IS MY GOOD FRIEND AMY JENKINS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK FOR AT FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL- I WAS VERY PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AB ON AB TWENTY TWENTY WHICH PERMITTED THE ISSUANCE OF TEMPORARY EVENT LICENSES- TO ALLOW FOR THE SALE AND CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS EDIT AND EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY A LOCAL JURISDICTION THIS HARD FOUGHT LEGISLATION WITH CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND TO THAT END WE INCORPORATED NUMEROUS PROVISIONS INTENDED TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS AND TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL ON THE SAME PREMISES AS WELL AS OTHER IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOL. I'M AROUND TO THESE TEMPORARY CANNABIS EVENTS WHAT WE DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE AT THAT TIME WAS HOW THE ABC WOULD INTERPRET STATUTE AND SO WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS AND TRADITIONAL VENUES WHERE WE WOULD LIKE AS AN INDUSTRY TO HOST A TEMPORARY EVENT IF THAT VENUE HAS AN ALCOHOL LICENSE IT IS TYPICALLY DISALLOWED. SO WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HOST SUCH EVENTS- YOU KNOW IN THOSE PARTICULAR LOCATION SO IT'S REALLY REALLY NARROWED OUR OPTIONS AND SO THIS IN IN MY MIND REALLY CLARIFIES WHAT THE ULTIMATE INTENT WAS ORIGINALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY TWENTY- BY EXPRESSLY SAYING YOU CAN IN FACT. HOST A TEMPORARY EVENT WITH LOCAL APPROVAL WITH THE STATE LICENSE FOLLOWING ALL THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS- ON EVENT AT A VENUE THAT ALSO HAS AN ABC LICENSE SO I KNOW THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEN TOOK THE AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE- ONTO TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY WE ALSO SECI A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PER INSTEAD IN THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE PRODUCT THAT IS NOT SOLD TO BE RETURNED ADD TO THAT CANNABIS RETAILER VIA A LICENSED DISTRIBUTOR A MICRO BUSINESS.

AN ISSUE OF PUBLIC SAFETY IF YOU WERE TO ASK MOST CONSTITUENTS DO WE WANT TO SET OUR ALARM CLOCKS AN HOUR EARLY IN THE WINTER AND WAKE AND GO TO WORK AND SCHOOL IN THE DARK THEY WOULD SAY NO. BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD FORCE THEM TO DO THE LAST TIME THIS WAS TRIED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR IT RESULTED IN SEVERAL DEATHS OF CHILDREN. HERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF CHILDREN WAITING FOR THE SCHOOL BUS IN THE DARK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING HOW. SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WOULD LOOK- UNDER PERMANENT DAYLIGHT TIME IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DARK. WOULD BE EVEN WORSE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS POLICY IS OPPOSED BY THE NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL.

MEET THE VOTERS SAID DEMAND TO AND CLOCK CHANGE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS BY PERMANENT STANDARD TIME. AS ARIZONA HAWAII AND ALL FIVE TERRITORIES HAVE DONE THAT IS WHAT IS FEDERALLY PRE APPROVED THAT IS THE QUICKEST SAFEST AND HEALTHIEST AND TO CLOCK CHANGE. I WOULD NOT SAVE ENERGY EITHER BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE WAKING PEOPLE UP EARLIER IN THE MORNING THEY'RE RUNNING THEIR HEAT WHICH CONSUMES MORE ENERGY.

WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ITS AND ITS STAFF FOR THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON THE BILL- IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND FOR ALL ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION. COUNTIES WERE ALLOWED BY YOUR LEGISLATURE TO TEMPER THE TEMPORARY ABILITY TO USE VENUES LIKE COMMUNITY CENTERS. VETERANS CALLED BANQUET ROOMS AND LOUNGES. LOCATIONS WE HAVE AVOIDED APPROACHING IN THE PAST. BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ARE ALSO PLACES. AVERAGES ARE STILL. AB TWENTY SEVEN WOULD MAKE THIS TEMPORARY CHANGE PERMANENT ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CONTINUE USING THESE LOCATIONS GOING FORWARD. FOR COUNTIES THAT WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE TEMPORARY LIFTING OF THE RESTRICTION THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WERE BETTER ABLE TO HELP THE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOUR POINT PLAY FACILITY OPTIONS ARE OFTEN LIMITED. IT'S SURPRISING TO THINK IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BECOMING HARDER NOT EASIER FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS TO FIND SUITABLE POLLING PLACES OR VOTE CENTERS FOR THEIR VOTERS. HOWEVER BADLY IT IS COLDER LESS INCLINED TO SERVE AS POLLING PLACES BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS. CHURCHES ARE REFUSING TO OPEN AS BOTH CENTERS AND RECORD NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLARIZING POLITICAL CLIMATE. SENIOR CENTERS ARE SAID THAT- BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF INDIAN ENDANGERINGTHEIR HEALTH THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. BUT PROP BOTH LOCATIONS AS PARTICULAR DIFFICULT FOR VOTE VOTERS CHOICE ACT COUNTY. YOU MUST HAVE DISABILITIES OPEN FOR FOUR OR ELEVEN DAYS IN A ROW. HAVING THESE HOLDEN WATCHES AVAILABLE AS BOTH CENTER SITE HAS BEEN A PERFECT ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE FACILITIES WHO ARE NOW TELLING US NO WE ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE YEAH. HOW THANK CHECK WITH THE PARKING PARKS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION EIGHTY COMPLIANCE AND MORE IN ORDER TO PICK THE RIGHT FACILITY FOR COMMUNITY AS A POLLING PLACE ARE VOTE CENTER AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO USE SOME FACILITIES THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAVE ENJOYED USING FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS NOW. I'M FINDING WILLING TO FACILITIES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT. WE ARE AWARE OF THE CONCERNS BROUGHT FORTH BY ALCOHOL JUSTICE IN THEIR OPPOSITION. REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HAD A PRODUCTIVE AND MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATION TO FIND MORE COMMON GROUND AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES.

A BILL A COUPLE COULD PASS WILL LEAVE THE GOT WE APPRECIATE. WHERE A PERSON HAS TO GET THE SECOND FOR MR BERMAN AND MR SALAS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES IS THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS ILLEGAL ONE SEVEN FOUR TWO I SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE RECEIVES ALL MONEY IT IS OWED BY TOBACCO COMPANIES AND PREVENT NON FIRE SAFE CIGARETTES FROM ENTERING THE MARKET. THE TOBACCO MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL PAYMENTS FROM TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS TO CALIFORNIA IN PERPETUITY WHICH HAVE EXCEEDED A HUNDRED MILLION IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER THESE PAYMENTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE DILIGENT ENFORCEMENT OF AN ESCROW STATUTE THAT IMPOSES FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ON TOBACCO COMPANIES. THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT STATE FROM LOSING OUT ON ANY PAYMENTS THIS BILL STRENGTHENS EXISTING LAW TO AID. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- AND THEREFORE SPENT OF THAT ESCROW STATUTE AND OTHER MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OBLIGATIONS BY TARGETING NON COMPLIANT BAD ACTORS. MEANWHILE THE FIRE SAFETY ACT PROHIBITS CIGARETTES FROM BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA UNLESS THEY MEET FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL REVIEW CIGARETTES TO VERIFY FIRE SAFETY. HOWEVER DUE TO CERTAIN RESTRAINTS MANY CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN AUTOMAT. PROVED WHICH- IS WHEN THE FIRE MARSHAL TAKES NO ACTION ON CIGARETTE APPLICATIONS AFTER TEN DAYS. SO THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF POTENTIAL WILDFIRE. ABOUT TRANSFER YOU FORCE MEANT. ACT GOES OFF WHICH FORCES OTHER PARTS OF THE PARK SAFETY ACT AND EXTENDS THE FIRE SAFETY REVIEW PERIOD FROM TEN DAYS TO THIRTY. A TO PROVIDE INTERCHANGEABLE AND WHAT TIME TO THAT FIRE SAFETY WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY ARE JANA STANFORD AND JAMES HART ON BEHALF OF THE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TOBACCO MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AND DILIGENTLY ENFORCE THE STATE ACOLYTES. DETERMINATION THE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT SATISFIED ARE ENFORCEMENT OBLIGATIONS COULD RISK THE LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ANNUAL SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVED. WHICH AS A FAMILY MEMBER RIVAS MENTION HAVE RECENTLY EXCEEDED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE THAT BUSINESS NOT ONLY THE SAME OVER TIME AB SEVENTY FORTY TWO WHAT AT THAT CALIFORNIA'S TOBACCO DIRECTORY STATUTE TO ADDRESS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY. INDEED IMPORTANT EFFORT. THE GOOD GOVERNANCE MEASURE THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND MAINTAIN THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR COMPLIANCE A GREAT MANUFACTURERS.
