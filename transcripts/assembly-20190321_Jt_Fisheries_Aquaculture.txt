YOU TAKING TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ALL OF THE VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK AT THE ANNUAL RECEPTION LAST NIGHT. IT WAS AN AMAZING SHOWCASE OF THE GOLDEN STATE'S SEAFOOD BOUNTY AND WE'RE GONNA STEP OUT OF WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO AND GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE. WE WANT TO WELCOME A ALL FISHERMEN WHO TRAVELED FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE TO THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION. FOR FORTY SIX YEARS EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES SPECIFIC COMMITTEES ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATIONS COUNCILS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR FISHERMEN PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN ANNUAL REPORT ON THEIR NEDS GOALS YEARLY ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. THE JOINT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN QUITE BUSY THE LAST SINCE THE LAST TIME WE ALL MET. WE HEARD FROM ALL OF YOU ABOUT THE NEED FOR DISASTER RELIEF IN SUCCESSFULLY SECURED DECORATIONS FOR CRAB SALMON AND SARDINES. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE STATUS OF THESE FUNDS WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON SECURING A FEDERAL DECLARATION FOR THE RED SEA URCHIN. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOME SWIFT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE NOT DONE UNTIL THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS START FLOWING INTO THE GOLDEN STATE. WE'VE ALSO BEEN MOVING I FISHERY RELATED LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION FOR WELDING COMMENCING CRAPPER TRIPLE THE CRAB FISHERY SALMON STEEL. ANCHOVIES HALIBUT. AQUA CULTURE IN MORE WE'VE BEEN ACTIVE ENGAGE WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU ALL THROUGHOUT THESE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN TODAY WITH AN OVER THE NEXT YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON STREAMLINING PERMANENT FOR THE OPERA CULTURE INDUSTRY AND MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF OFFSHORE WIND HAS ON OUR OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS. IN FISHERIES YOU WERE GOING TO BE SEEN A HEARING COMING UP IN MAY WHICH WILL BE HOSTING IN THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTY OF HUMBLE WILL ALSO BE ADVANCING FOR THE SECOND TIME A FISHERIES ON THIS BILL LATER THIS YEAR. THIS SEASON WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF WATER BUT WE ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE IMPACTS OF CALIFORNIA'S EXTENDED DROUGHT. POUR WATER MANAGEMENT THAT KILLED MORE THAN 95% OF BABY SALMON ALONG WITH LOUSY OCEAN CONDITIONS CREATED A PERFECT STORM OF SOUND SALMON KILLING EVENTS. THESE LIMITATIONS DRAMATICALLY IMPACT OUR ECONOMY ALONG THE ENTIRE WEST COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO CANADA. BUT SOME GOOD NEWS WE'RE TURNING THAT SHIP AROUND BUT WE ARE STILL FAR FROM A FULL PRODUCTIVE SEASON FOR COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL INTRACTABLE SALMON FISHERMEN. IN WHILE WE SEEN IMPROVEMENT WE STILL NEED ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO OF GOOD CONDITIONS TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD OUR STUFF. OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL HERE TODAY IS TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THE ISSUES INTO WAYS RAISE AWARENESS. THE PRECARIOUS STATE OF OUR FISHERIES AND EDUCATE THE LEGISLATURE RESIDENTS ABOUT THEIR STATUS THREATS IN SUCCESS WE HAVE AN ALL STAR LINE OF OUR PANELISTS TODAY BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO IT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER.

I KNOW FOR MOST OF THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM YOU WOULD MUCH RATHER BE ON THE WATER. THEN IN SACRAMENTO AND ESPECIALLY IN A LEGISLATIVE HEARING. BUT IF I LOOK AT AND SPECIALLY OUT OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH UNDER CHERUB MCGUIRE. THE STRIDES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE TO BRIDGE SOME OF THE GAPS AND BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT. SUPPORT THE FISHERY SUPPORT THE GOALS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE LEGISLATURE AND REALLY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT SOMETHING TO TAKE PRIDE IN. IT'S NOT BEEN A PERFECT JOURNEY BY IT'S A JOURNEY THAT I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TAKEN AS MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO WE'LL ALL LOOK FOR TO A TO A GOOD HEARING TODAY. AND WITH THE GOOD INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AND THE FACT THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS NOW REACHED OUT AND BEEN WILLING TO HOLD HEARINGS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR SO THAT WE CAN TIMELY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT COME UP WITH THE FISHING INDUSTRY SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICAL ABSOLUTELY TO CALIFORNIA. SO LOOK FOR TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TODAY AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH BY SHEER. WE'RE ALSO REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SIMILAR DOLLY HERE WE'RE HOPING THAT HE'S GONNA BE JOINING US IN THE SENATE HERE -- IN A FEW WEEKS IN AND TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO YOU MISTER DALI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP TODAY I JUST WANTED. TO KIND OF MAYBE USE A SPRING BOARD OF OUR NEW SECRETARY TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT -- AS YOU KNOW NONE OF MY DISTRICT TOUCHES THE OCEAN -- DIRECTLY BUT INDIRECTLY IT DOES -- BY REPRESENT -- CLASS INCLUDE THIS YEAR A BEAUT PLASTER NEVADA -- IT AND BUT WE HAVE THE ORVILLE WE HAVE SHASTA DAM AND WE HAVE THE BIGGEST -- WATERSHED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH A IS THE HABITAT AND RIGHT. AREAS -- FOR FISH IN WATER AND CLEAN SOURCE WATER BUT I WANT TO JUST SHARE A THAT MAYBE AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD -- TALK ABOUT. THE STATE OF YOU KNOW CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE LAST YEAR WE BURNED ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES. AND THAT'S THE WATERSHED -- THAT FEEDS THE STREAMS AND AND RIVERS THAT ALLOW -- YOU HABITAT FOR THE FISH THAT EVENTUALLY ENDS UP IN THE OCEAN AND AND CRATES OCEAN HABITAT AS WELL. SO JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT AND IT'S NOT AN ORIGIN I KNOW BUT HOPEFULLY WE TALK ABOUT THAT I KNOW THAT. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FIRE AND AND IT'S OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS FAMILY AND WE'VE SEEN. OF THE LARGEST FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY AND WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE HABITAT AND WILDLIFE IT'S OUT THERE ACTUALLY THE BILL THIS YEAR IS ONE OF THE LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT I'M RUNNING A BILL TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME. TO QUANTIFY THE HABITAT AND WILDLIFE -- THAT WE'VE LOST -- IN DUE TO FIRE AND SO WE CAN ACTUALLY CAN START GAUGING THAT AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THE THE PUBLIC COST IS TO THAT SO -- THE FOUR DOOR HEARING IN -- APPRECIATE BEING ON THE COMMITTEE AS A MEMBER WHO DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE -- DEPARTMENT ISSUE THAT TOUCHES THE OCEAN BUT I DO INDIRECTLY AND LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH TO SEND WOMEN AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK -- IN YOUR AFFIX HIM WE HAVE HAD TO RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE. THERE'S GENERALLY NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE HEARING AND AGAIN WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I IT IT IS BEEN A TRADITION THAT THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES KICKS OFF FOR HEARING ALONG WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WE'RE GONNA WELCOME BOTH GENTLEMEN TO BE A COME UP TO THE DICE AT THIS TIME. WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM MR WADE CROWFOOT SECRETARY THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY. THE SECRETARY -- EASE IS GOING TO BE FOCUSING THESE FISHERIES PRIORITIES FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR FISHERIES AQUACULTURE AND AN OVERALL FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO FISHERIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT MISTER CHUCK BONHAM IS HERE TODAY HE'S A DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE. THE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO BE DOING A BIT OF A DEEP DIVE ON HIS PRIORITIES IN HE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIES FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOCUSING ON DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING. WHALE TANGLED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORKING GROUP HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE GIVEN AS A SNEAK PREVIEW ON THE SALMON SEASON. AS WELL AS A BIT OF A GAUGE OF WHAT IT'S LOOKING LIKE ON THE KLAMATH RIVER IN THE SPRING TION OF LISTING. WE'RE GRATEFUL BOTH THE GENTLEMAN TO BE HERE TODAY SECRETARY AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON BEHALF THE JOINT COMMITTEE WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROMPT AND THEN WE'LL THEN TURNED OVER TO THE DIRECTOR IT WILL HOLD ON QUESTIONS UNTIL BOTH. AT THE GENTLEMAN A COMPLETE THEIR COMMENTS FORESHORES GREAT THANKS SO MUCH CHAIR FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY MY FIRST. APPEARANCE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE BUT TRADITION THAT I HOPE TO MAINTAIN AS SECRETARY OF THE NATURIST ARSES AGENCY -- REALLY AND AND HAVE AN ATTENDANCE RECORD THAT IS A 100% SO. HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE HI TO THAT OR NEAR THAT -- THE OPPORTUNITY LAST NIGHT FOR MANY OF US TO ACTUALLY MEET -- WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FISHERIES INDUSTRY FISHING INDUSTRY WAS REALLY VALUABLE. AND IT DROVE HOME. A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT TWO REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS TO ME THE FIRST IS THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTUALLY THOSE WHO MAKE THEIR LIVING -- ON THE WATER ACTUALLY COMING UP HERE IN TALKING TO POLICY MAKERS -- THAT'S CRITICAL SO I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME FOR ACTUALLY TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR WORK LIVES -- IN GIVING YOU KNOW REVENUE IT ACTUALLY BE UP HERE AND TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD WHICH RELATES TO MY SECOND POINT WHICH IS. YEAH THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THIS DAY TODAY NO THIS RESOURCE BETTER THAN MOST OF US. AND ARE IMPACTED BY THIS RESOURCE BETTER THAN MOST OF US. NOT HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO SOME FOLKS -- LAST NIGHT THEY SAID LOOK. IF YOU CUT A SEASON OFF YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS -- YOU CUT TWO MONTHS AFTER SEASON THAT IMPACTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ANNUAL SALARY OUR TAKE HOME. SO YOU KNOW THESE DISCUSSIONS AROUND REGULATIONS AND RULES YOU KNOW I HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF OF OF OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT I THINK WE JUST ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP FIRST AND FOREMOST IN OUR MIND. ARE SO IT'S A REALLY HELPFUL REMINDER -- AND THEN JUST -- YOU KNOW INVOKE BILL GREIDER WHO YOU KNOW I THINK IT HELPED INITIATE THIS -- JOINT COMMITTEE IN OVER FORTY YEARS AGO AND THEN A SON ZEKE IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING AND PROUD TRADITION OF NOT ONLY IN. OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES BUT THEY'RE ABBA SO LET ME JUST AT THE VERY HIGH LEVEL. YOU KNOW SHARE WITH YOU WHY I THINK -- THE FISHERIES ARE VALUABLE TO OUR STATE -- AS I START THIS WORK I MEAN CLEARLY I THEIR ECONOMIC LIFEBLOOD FOR MANY COMMUNITIES FROM SAN DIEGO OPERA CRESCENT CITY. I AND SO KEEPING THIS RESOURCE VIABLE AND KEEPING THIS INDUSTRY VIABLE IS CRITICAL TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. SECONDLY I YOU KNOW KEEPING THIS RESOURCE VIABLE AND KEEPING OUR FISHERIES HEALTHY IS CRITICAL FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. TO CALIFORNIA IS BLAST BY SO MUCH IN TERMS OF ITS ITS NATURAL SYSTEMS NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FISHERIES ARE NO EXCEPTION. WE ARE REMARKABLE BIO DIVERSITY I AND WE HAVE A CHARACTER OF OUR FISHERIES SORT OF WRIT LARGE THAT IS ALMOST UNIQUE IN THE WORLD -- SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL AND IN THE CULTURAL ASPECT OF OUR FISHERIES NOT ONLY TO THOSE -- SOVEREIGN NATIONS YOU KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN HARVESTING THE RESOURCE. FOR MILLENNIA BUT FOR OUR IDENTITY AS CALIFORNIANS. I MEAN WE YOU KNOW WILL PRESIDE OVER REGULATIONS THAT KEEPS SPECIES HEALTHY THAT I'VE BEEN RETURNING TO CERTAIN TRIBUTARIES OF THE SACRAMENTO FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS. AND THAT AS CALIFORNIANS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL PLACE TO LIVE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THE THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY AND THE OCEAN AND OUR WATER WAYS SO IT'S ESSENTIAL TO ALL THAT WE DO. CLEARLY HUGE CHALLENGES THAT WERE CONTENDING WITH -- ONE OF WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CLIMATE CHANGE. I AM AS I UNDERSTAND IT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE OCEANS -- WHICH IS HAVING IMPACT ON THE FISHERIES IN ACIDIFICATION. IS WREAKING HAVOC HI IF YOU'RE SHELLFISH FARMER IT MEANS IT IMPACTS ON YOUR YIELDS -- IF YOUR CRAB FISHERMEN IT MEANS YOU'RE SEES AND MAY HAVE BEEN CLOSED -- BY IT WAS CLOSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AS A RESULT OF DEMONIC ACID WHICH HAS A CONNECTION. TO OUR CLIMATE CHANGE. HI AND THEN IMPACTING MIGRATION PATTERNS OF MARINE MAMMALS I AND CHALLENGING THAT KIND OF THE USUAL -- HARVEST OF OF CRAP ANOTHER FISHERIES. BUT THEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- DOLLIES POINT -- LET'S NOT ONLY FORGET OUR LET'S NOT FORGET I SHOULD SAY THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE OCEANS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WATERWAYS AND OUR HEADWATERS. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- FISHERIES IN THE FUTURE I WANT TO INTEGRATE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. CAL FIRE WHICH YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY N. C. IMPACTING FISHERIES BUT YOU CAN BAT -- THAT OUR FORESTS ARE IN CRISIS AND THEY HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON OUR WATERSHEDS NOT ONLY THE SUPPLY OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES. BUT NOT THE SUPPLY WATER THAT PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT FOR THE FISHERIES. SO I'M REALLY X. EXCITED AND COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE WE CONNECT THESE DOTS IN TERMS OF OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND WE DON'T TREAT OCEANS AND FRESH WATER AND FORESTS SEPARATELY IN SEPARATE SILOS BUT WE INTEGRATE -- AND IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL -- MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW I'M I'M COMMITTED TO SPENDING TIME ARE REQUIRED TO ROLL UP SLEEVES AND ADDRESS CHALLENGES -- THAT WE'RE FACING WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING -- EMERGENCY. DISASTER FUNDING FOR THE CLOSURE OF CRAB SEASON THREE FROM THREE YEARS AGO STILL WORKING ON THAT -- OR IF IT'S AGAIN ROLLING UP SLEEVES WITH YOU KNOW ON ON REGULATORY QUESTIONS ARE CHALLENGES AS THEY ARISE -- I WANT TO BE THE KIND OF LEADER AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY THAT SUPPORTS MY DEPARTMENTS TO DO GOOD WORK AND THE PROBLEM SOLVE WITH LEGISLATORS. AND STAKEHOLDERS LIKE LIKE FISHING INDUSTRY AS PROBLEMS ARISE -- ALAS WE SAY I WANT TO THANK OUR DIRECTOR BONG WITH -- CHUCK FOR FIVE YEARS IN THE ADMINISTRATION -- WHEN I WASN'T WORKING ON NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES WHEN I WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND I CAN TELL YOU -- HE WAS THE VOICE FOR FISHERIES OVER THAT FIVE YEARS IN SOME DIFFICULT TIMES WITH THE CRAB CLOSURE AND ETCETERA AND IN MOST OF WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN CALIFORNIA FISHERIES I'VE LEARNED FROM SHOCK SO. LOOKING FOR DINNER TO WORKING WITH HIM AND BEGAN INTEGRATING THESE OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH MY WITHIN MY AGENCY INTO THIS DISCUSSION ON FISHERIES -- AND THEN LASTLY I'LL I'LL REPEAT A POINT THAT WAS MADE LAST NIGHT WHICH IS. YOU KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR FISHING INDUSTRIES HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THEY HAVE TO BE AT THE CENTER OF THE DISCUSSIONS -- ABOUT -- HOW WE STEWARD THIS RESOURCE BECAUSE THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN SACRAMENTO I HAVE REAL IMPACT ON THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND ON THEIR COMMUNITIES? YOU ALL KNOW THIS WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE ON THE JOINT COMMITTEE BUT I DO THINK IT'S IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO GIVE -- YOU KNOW THIS INDUSTRY AND ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING IT A MEANINGFUL HOW TO IDENTIFY SOLUTION THROUGH THESE CHALLENGES -- SO I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE I'M EXCITED -- TO SYMBOLIZE OR AT LEAST I AM. VERBALIZE -- MY COMMITMENT AND THENI'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT DEMONSTRATING AND PROVING THAT COMMITMENT OVER TIME INTO THIS JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SECTOR WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU HERE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME YOU BUSY SCHEDULE AND WILL HOLD COMMENTS UNTIL -- DIRECTOR BOTTOM -- IT COMPLETES HIS COMIC STRIP BAR ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOUR TEN MINUTES AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO ACER'S COULD YOU SEE THAT THANK YOU TO OUR CULTURE. MEMBERS HAD THESE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS ARE PERSONAL TO ME. I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE PROFESSIONAL LIFE FOCUSED ON THEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THEIR PERSONAL TO YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. SO MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WHICH I STILL THINK IS THE GREATEST JOB IN THE WORLD. MY FIRST SHOT OUT GOES TO THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT YOUR LEFT I CONSIDER WAIT A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE AND I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER SECRETARY FOR OUR AGENCY SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THAT REGARD. YOUR MARCH TENTH LETTER TO ME ASKED ME TO COVER A LOT OF DETAILS SO LET ME GET GOING. UNLIKE PRIOR YEARS HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE TAKE AWAY I WANT FOR YOU TO HEAR AND EVERYONE LISTENING. GOOD NEWS. THERE'S WAY MORE GOOD NEWS THIS YEAR THAN ANY ONE OF MY PRIOR UPDATES TO YOU IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. YOU ASKED ABOUT MY PARTIES FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LET ME START IN AN ODD PLACE. SUSTAINABLE FUNDING [inaudible] WHY? FINDING IT WAS TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE TRUST TRUST BECAUSE CAPACITY CAPACITY BECAUSE OUTCOMES. IF WE CAN PRODUCE OUTCOMES WE CAN KEEP FISHING FOR EVER. SO YOU'LL REMEMBER IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED NEW FUNDING. N. POSITIONS WE TOOK ELEVEN OF THOSE POSITIONS WHICH ARE NEW. AND WE DEPLOY THEM ON TO THESE TOPICS AND HEAR SOME THE OUTCOMES. WE'VE IMPROVED OUR DATA STREAM LYING AND ELECTRONIC REPORTING WE HEARD A NEW DATA MANAGER. AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO COMPLETING AN ENTIRE TRANSITION OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD DATABASE. TO A NEW STATE OF THE ART DATABASE FOR COMMERCIAL FISH LANDINGS IN THE STATE THAT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S WAY PAST DUE. WE'VE DEVELOPED AND DISTRIBUTED ALL WHOLE USER GUIDE FOR FISH BUSINESS YOU TICKETS THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE. AND WE'VE PRETTY MUCH SWAPPED OVER SOME OF OUR KEY SECTORS FROM PAPER [inaudible] THE DIGITAL. BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE NEW CAPACITY INPUTTED TO FISHER'S WORK. WE HIRED TWO NEW POSITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE AND INNOVATIVE FISHERY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. ONE OF WHICH IS FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON THINKING THROUGH THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THE FISHERIES. AND DEALING WITH EXPERIMENTAL PILOT PROJECTS -- OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON OUT IN OUR OCEANS. WE TOOK TO THOSE POSITIONS AND WE HARD NEWS STAFF DEDICATED TO WHALE SAVE FISHERIES. THEN USING THAT STAFF IN NEW CAPACITY WE'VE IMPLEMENTED NEW REGULATIONS TO RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF SURFACE GEAR WHICH CAN BE USED IN DUNGEONS CRAB TRAPS. WE'VE DEVELOPED OUR ABANDONED AND LOST COMMERCIAL CROWD CHAT PROGRAM WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE. AND WE'VE KIND OF UNDER WRITTEN THE CONVENING OF THE DODGES CRAB. GEAR WORKING GROUP AND THE TASK FORCE WHICH BY THE WAY GOOD NEWS ALERT MMHM MMHM MMHM. I WAS TALKING WITH THE OCEAN AND OUR DEPARTMENT STAFF WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SO THERE'S NO BREAK. THERE'S A SEAMLESS -- PROGRESSION OF THE MEETING OF THE TASK FORCE AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. SO AS WE COME OUT OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING YOU MAY REMEMBER WE WERE ALSO SIGNED SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AS AN ASSIGNMENT WHAT IS THAT. WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH OUR FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF OUTLINING ALL THE INDIVIDUAL TASKS THE DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE. FOR WITH HARDEN INTERNATIONAL FORM TO LLOYD CONSULTING. AND ALIGNING THOSE TASKS WITH OUR MISSIONS IN OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR PURPOSES. WE'VE POSTED ALL THIS ON A DEDICATED PUBLIC WEB PAGE WHICH IS FOUND ON OUR HOME PAGE AT THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH YOUR BUDGET STAFF TO A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH HOSTED SEVERAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PUBLIC MEETING APRIL EIGHTH. TO LAY OUT ALL THE PHASE ONE WORK AROUND OUR BUDGET OUR PROGRAM AND OUR TASKS RELATIVE TO THE DEPARTMENT'S CAPACITY. I MENTIONED THE TECH IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE HAVE LAUNCHED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION ETEC. WHICH WILL BE USED FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL FISHING LANDINGS EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF THIS YEAR. SO JULY ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THE HOME OF TECHNOLOGY WE WILL FINALLY HAVE ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL FISHERIES. THE LANDING THEIR INFORMATION USING AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE SYSTEM -- I HAVE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO OUR COMMITMENT TO SEND OF SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. LET ME MOVE ON TO OTHER GOOD NEWS. GROUNDFISH STOCKS IN CALIFORNIA ARE REBUILDING. AND WE ONLY HAVE TWO GROUNDFISH STOCKS. OFF OF OUR COAST REMAINING THAT ARE CONSIDERED OVERFISHED. THIS IS TRANSLATING INTO MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL ANGLERS AND IT'S A BIG DEAL. IF YOU GO BACK FIVE TEN YEARS MOST OF THESE STOCKS WERE DEEMED OVERFISHED. AND WE'VE REBUILT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT. FOR TWO THAT MEANS THE FOLKS BEHIND ME IN THIS ROOM HAVE MORE RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL FISHING OPPORTUNITY. LET'S TURN TO THE KLAMATH. I THINK THIS IS GOOD NEWS AS WELL. MOST RECENTLY WE HAD A DISRUPTION IN THE FORCE AROUND THE PROSPECT OF LISTING A CERTAIN RUN OF SALMON THAT EXIST IN THE KLAMATH RIVER. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. OUR FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TOOK THIS UP AT HIS LAST PUBLIC MEETING. AND I OFFERED TO THE COMMISSION AND THE STAKE HOLDERS INVOLVED. TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION AROUND WHETHER THERE WAS A WAY TO HAVE THE LISTING PROCESS CONTINUE.-AT THE SAME TIME WE PROVIDE SOME FISHING OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS ALLOWABLE UNDER LAW WE'VE LOOKED INTO IT WE'VE HELD THREE MEETINGS WITH NORTH COAST COUNTY. IN NORTH COAST FISHING INTERESTS TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR RE OPENING A FISHERY FOR THE SPRING CHINOOK SALMON ON THE KLAMATH RIVER WHILE WE'RE CONTINUING OUR STATUS REVIEW. SUBJECT TO THE THE ESA PETITION -- LISTING PROCESS. SO WE'VE ALREADY HAD MEETINGS IN CRESCENT CITY. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A MEETING IN READING SCHEDULE FOR NEXT WEEK ON THAT TOPIC. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE OCEAN SALMON FISHING SEASON ALTERNATIVES WERE DEVELOPED ALREADY IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO MINIMIZE THE RISK. OF SPRING RUN IN THE KLAMATH BECAUSE THEY MAY EVENTUALLY BE LISTED. AND UNDER LAW IN THE STATE SIDE WHILE WE'RE CONSIDERING LISTING FOR THE YEAR PERIOD. THEY GET LEGAL PROTECTION SO WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER TO THE FEDERAL FRONT AND TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL. OPTIONS IN THE OCEAN BEING SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTIVE OF THE SPRING RUN AS THEY'RE OUT IN THE OCEAN. IF YOU TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT THE OCEAN OVERALL I ALSO THINK THIS IS GOOD NEWS. THE SPORT AND COMMERCIAL OCEAN SALMON FISHERIES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S MOSTLY DO A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE OCEAN ABUNDANCE CONDITIONS AND FORECAST. SO THOSE SEASON DATES WILL BE FINALIZED UNTIL APRIL. BUT IF I LOOK AT ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AT THE FEDERAL COUNCIL LEVEL ALL OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES. ALLOW FOR SIGNIFICANT FISHING TIME IN THE OCEAN OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WHICH IS GOOD NEWS COMPARED TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN. YEARS BEFORE. IF YOU TURN AND LOOK FRESH WATER INLAND I THINK THAT'S MORE GOOD NEWS AS WELL. THE OUTLOOK FOR THE RECREATIONAL FISHING ON FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON IS ALSO POSITIVE. FOR BOTH THE KLAMATH TRIGGER TRINITY RIVERS AND THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WE ANTICIPATE A GOOD SEASON -- WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A REDUCE SEASON THE SACRAMENTO AS WAS THE CASE LAST YEAR -- AND THE COMMISSION -- IS ALSO GOING TO BE CONSIDERING EXTENDING SEASONS IN BOTH THE FEATHER AND THEM CALLING ME RIVERS. SO IF YOU LOOK TO THE OCEAN AND YOU LOOK IN RIVER WE'RE SEEING GOOD NEWS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE THAT. LET ME TURN TO DENTURES GRAB. SO WE'RE STILL COLLECTING ALL THE LANDING INFORMATION. BUT BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY LANDINGS AND THE OBSERVATIONS WE'RE AWARE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEASON. IS ANTICIPATED TO YIELD LESS THAN WAS LANDED DURING THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEASON. SO JUST FOR REFERENCE POINT THE TOTAL SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVENUE WAS ABOUT SIXTY NINE IT'S NOT ABOUT IT WAS PRECISELY. SIXTY NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND I THINK IT'LL BE A LITTLE OFF OF THAT ONCE WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEASON -- INFORMATION [inaudible] DEMO CASSIDY. IS A BAD NEWS STORY BUT IN SOME SENSE THIS YEAR IT WAS GOOD NEWS COMPARED TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN MOST RECENTLY. IT DID CONTINUE TO CAUSE FISHERY DELAYS IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE BUT IT JUST WAS NOT AS NEARLY SEVERE OR AS WIDESPREAD AS PRIOR SEASONS. SOME OF OUR NORTHERN AREAS WERE DELAYED UP TO THREE WEEKS WHILE OTHER AREAS EXPERIENCED NO DELAYS AT ALL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS A LITTLE IMPROVED ABILITY TO FINE TUNE. HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHICH PARTS OF THE STATE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CLOSURE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO KEEP? OTHER PARTS OPEN RATHER THAN. A BROADER CLOSURE APPROACH LOOKING AT IT MORE SURGICALLY BASED ON OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES. AND THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. DISASTER FUNDING. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE CRAB DISASTER FUNDING. AND I MADE A PROMISE TO NO ONE OPPENHEIM YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD GO CHECK INTO THIS. AND WE CAN REPORT. THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME VERY RECENT LAST MAYBE TWO DAYS QUESTIONS FROM THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT BUDGET -- AND BE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE THINK THEIR FINAL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. WE SPOKE WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND WE THINK WE CAN. SEE THESE FUNDS COMING TO US BY MAY. ONE BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE HERE TOMORROW. SO I WILL MAKE MY COMMITMENT IS DIRECTOR AND I THINK THE SECRETARY WILL CONCUR WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO GET THOSE FUNDS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BEFORE MAY [inaudible] ONE WELL ENTITLEMENTS STUFFED UP. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL COURT -- AROUND LITIGATION OVER THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN OUR DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY. AND ENTANGLEMENTS OF THESE MAJESTIC MARINE MAMMALS. WHAT I WILL SAY ON THAT FRONT IS IT'S A COMPLICATED -- PIECE OF FEDERAL [inaudible] LITIGATION. I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND THE INTERESTS OF THE PLAINTIFF THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. AND THE INTERVENOR THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. AND I THINK ALL THREE PARTIES THOSE TWO IN THE DEPARTMENT. UNDERSTAND WHAT AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE MIGHT LOOK LIKE. AND I'M HOPEFUL WE CAN GET A RESOLUTION AND I CAN COME BACK TO YOU PRETTY SOON. AND LAY OUT THE THE POSSIBLE RESOLUTION TO THIS RISK MEANWHILE -- WE HAVE A RULE MAKING PACKAGE IMPLEMENTING YOUR GEAR RETRIEVAL PROGRAM -- IT'S CURRENTLY OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND IT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THANK YOU FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THAT LEGISLATION. EFFECTIVELY AS YOU KNOW IT MEANS WE CAN GET PEOPLE OUT THERE MORE SMARTLY PICKING UP A BANDED CRAB GEAR AND BRINGING IT BACK YOU'RE MARKING. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS TO STANDARDIZE THE MARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANYBODY WHO IS FISHING FIXED GEAR IN THE OCEAN. AND WE ANTICIPATE RELEASING THOSE REGULATIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THIS SUMMER. THEY'RE GOING TO PRESCRIBE THE DIMENSION SHAPE COLOR FOR BOOBY TAGS. TO YOUR TRAPS OR ANY STRING OF TRAPS AND THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT. AND A A MOVEMENT IN THE DIRECTION OF WILL SAY FISHERIES. AND AS MOST OF YOU KNOW BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. A PUBLICLY STATED OUR DEPARTMENT WILL BE. ON FILING A NOTICE OF INTENT TO APPLY FOR AN INSTANT ALL TAKE PERMIT UNDER THE FEDERAL ESA. HERE'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO END UP. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA END UP THERE PRETTY SOON. A RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE OF THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN WELLS IN OUR FISHERIES. WERE WE CAN CREDIBLY STAND UP AND SAY. WE'RE SAVING WHALES. AND WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE WELL SAVE [inaudible] GRAB. WE CAN DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE ONE IN THE NATION. AND FOLKS CAN FEEL CONFIDENT EATING THE CRAB AND ENJOYING IT. AND KNOWING WE'RE SAVING WELLS AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WITH THAT CLOSE TO THAT CANAL COME THE AQUACULTURE. E. D. I. R. WHICH IS A MOUTHFUL LET ME JUST GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG. IT'S BEEN LURKING IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT FOR TOO MANY YEARS. AND I THINK RIGHT NOW HAVING DONE AN ASSESSMENT YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT IN A MINUTE. WE'RE GONNA GET THIS THING OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BY THE END OF THIS MAY. THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION YOU ASKED ABOUT. WE ARE NEXT WEEK PUTTING OUT A RULE MAKING PACKAGE TO IMPLEMENT THE DRIFT GILL NET BUYOUT PROGRAM. SO THE PUBLIC WILL SEE THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A FUNDING MECHANISM TO PHASE OUT THE REMAINING TWENTY OR SO FOLKS USING THAT FISHING TYPE WE ARE. ABOUT TO PUT OUT AN APPROACH FOR CREATING A PATHWAY FOR EXPERIMENTAL FISHING PERMITS WITH THE BILL'S SPONSOR -- THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING. AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY SOME OF THE TOPICS I'VE GOT MY MY MIND ON IN MY EYE ON FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY OFF SHORE OGLE CULTURE ARTIFICIAL REEFS AND MARINE SPECIAL PLANNING. LET ME STOP THERE I HOPE I WAS CLOSE TO TEN MINUTES AND WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TRIGGER VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH PRESENTATION. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- BUT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR FIRST TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE DIRECTOR IN YOUR AT THE SECTOR -- YOU MENTIONED THE THE SETTLEMENT AROUND THE ENTANGLEMENTS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSE COULD YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU LET US KNOW WELL TO FIGURE OUT A FORM TO MAKE SURE WE WHATEVER INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE WE CAN. I UNDERSTAND AND THEN AND THEN GET BACK OUT YES. AT THE MOMENT I BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT IT IN PUBLIC I WOULD WELCOME THE CHANCE TO COMMON. A SPEAK WITH YOUR OFFICES AND I THINK ALSO DO THIS IN A PUBLIC FORUM I THINK THERE'S A CREDIBLE ENDEAVOR. BY ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE SOLUTION. THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. AND THEN THE THE EXPERIMENTATION PERMIT THE EXPERIMENT PER THE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED. TO FIGURE PATHWAYS FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY AS THE AS WE TRY AND EXPERIMENT WITH GEAR. WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY WORKING WITH THE FLEET AND MOVING FORWARD. FINDING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO EXPERIMENTAL WORK AND RESEARCH WORK. IN CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT IT'S IN OUR WATERS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO MORE BROADLY IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS. IS AN ENDEAVOR THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH YOUR AGENCY A KIND OF ACROSS AGENCIES. SECRETARY ON IT IN UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN BETTER. IMPLEMENT THOSE PERMITS SO THAT WE GET AND BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THIS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO THAT'S JUST A SUBJECT THAT I THINK I'M HOPING THAT THIS COMMITTEE. WE'LL KEEP ON OUR RADAR SAID THAT WE WORK THROUGH IT IN THAT THAT WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT AS WE NEED TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES. ON BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING I'M VERY INTERESTED AT THIS POINT. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP YOU BET AND WE WERE ACTUALLY PRETTY RECENTLY ABLE TO DO ONE OF OUR FIRST AND ONLY EXPERIMENTAL GEAR PERMITS FOR A BOX CRAB FISHERY -- IT TOOK ABOUT TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS TO WORK OUT A BILL AND TO BE HONEST OUR DEPARTMENT HELLO HISTORICAL RESISTANCE. INTERNALLY TO THE IDEA OF EXPERIMENTING. AND I ACTUALLY THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE IN PLACE YOU'LL SEE A RULE MAKING FROM US. WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING ON WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THAT A LAY OUT THE EXPEDITED PATHWAY. FOR DOING MORE EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES OFFSHORE. GOOD BECAUSE AS WE SORT THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE NEED TO BE DOING THESE THINGS HERE. IN WAYS THAT THAT WE FIND ACCEPTABLE WITH REALLY ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SO I I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT THANKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESSURE. SYSTEM [inaudible] RIGHT. DOESN'T COME INTO QUESTIONS ON A FEW ITEMS AND IS GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF SHOCK ON APPROACH WORKS WE ALL ON THIS -- TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TOP ISSUE SAID. THE EJECTOR TOUCHED ON AS WELL AS ITEMS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD. LEANING FEES -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO REPEAT BUT WE HAD A TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AGO PLAYING THE FEES. NO CERTAINLY NOT HAVE THAT FISHERMEN DON'T AND I ALSO KNOW -- THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T -- AS HE CONTINUES SO -- LONG STORY SHORT -- WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN INCREMENTALLY. LOOK AT AN ANNUAL INCREASE. I EVERY OTHER YEAR INCREASE THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEES CAN BE FOCUSING ON THIS YEAR BECAUSE IF WE JUST LOOK AT FREEZE WE'RE GONNA END UP IN THE SAME PLACE. AND JUST -- YOUR EARLY THOUGHT ON THAT. AS A MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO YOU LIVE THROUGH THE FEE INCREASE EXPERIENCE LIKE I DID. DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN YEAH I'M AWARE OF LEGISLATION THAT SUGGESTS THERE'S A WAY TO INCREMENTALLY INCREASE FROM THE BASELINE OF TODAY. HERE TO SOME INDEX IT EXACTLY -- I THINK THAT'S WORTH CONSIDERING AND OF COURSE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE A SYSTEM TO THINK THROUGH ALL PROPOSED LEGISLATION. YEAH I. N. M. LOOK NOT TRYING TO ADVOCATE FOR AT THE MOMENT I JUST THINK THAT -- THE PASS IS ALWAYS A PRETTY GOOD PREDICTOR OF WHAT THE FUTURE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THIS LEARN FROM THOSE LESSONS SO THAT WE DON'T END UP -- IN THAT SAME SEAT AGREE AND ONE OF THE COMPOUNDING FACTORS LAST DISCUSSION AROUND WAS IT HAD BEEN SO LONG SINCE EXACTLY AND I THINK THE IDEA IS RESPONSIVE TO THAT. DR. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I'M LIKE YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE IN THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN A FISHERY BY FISHERY. I SO IF YOU CAN JUST -- TALK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY WHAT I AM ABOUT THE FISHERY BY FISHERY -- BUDGET MANAGEMENT THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO I THINK THAT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO THAT WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION OVER DURING MEANING FEES THE DISCUSSION CERTAINLY ANY FEES IS. EACH FISHERIES KIND OF LUMPED INTO ONE POT I'M BEING UP. WAIT GENERAL THE MOMENT. THIS SERVICE FACE BHAJAN IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO FOCUSON INDIVIDUAL FISHERIES I BELIEVE IF YOU CAN JUST TOUCH BASE ON THAT. SO IT'S A IT'S A MOUTHFUL TO SAY SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND WHEN I SAY IT MOST PEOPLE'S EYES GLOSS OVER. BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S AN ACTUAL BUSINESS DISCIPLINE. THE LLOYD IS PROBABLY THE PRIMERA DITTY THAT'S DOING IT IN THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR. THE BUDGET ACT INSTRUCTS ME TO HER HIRE A CONSULTANT WE'VE HEARD THEM. AND AS I SEE THE PRODUCT. THE OUTCOME IS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF TASKS. THAT OCCUR WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. CONNECTED TO PROGRAM AND PURPOSE WHICH IN MY MIND IN THIS CASE. WILL ALLOW US TO SEE THE FISHERY SPECIFIC YOU KNOW ORGANIZATION. AND THEN YOU COMPARE THOSE TWO LEVELS OF INFORMATION TO WHAT YOUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND WHAT'S KIND OF YOUR OPTIMAL LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND LOOKING AT THE PARKS DEPARTMENT WHICH USE SOMETHING SIMILAR YOU GET A PUBLIC FACING DASHBOARD. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLORE THAT INFORMATION REAL TIME. AND SEE HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS ANALYZING TASKS REVENUE. FISHERIES SECTOR IF YOU WILL YEAH. CURRENT AN OPTIMAL. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED -- WE HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK LEFT IS A LONG WAY TO GO LET'S BE HONEST TO ME JUST SO I CAN IN THE IN. THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO AND IT PROVIDES. LOOK BOTTOM LINE IT HELPS THE DEPARTMENT ON WHERE THEY'RE SPENDING THE TIME. AND WHAT WE ALL NOW IS TIME IS MONEY -- AND IT ALSO PROVIDES THE PUBLIC AND THE FISHING COMMUNITY TRANSPARENCY YESTERDAY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON WHAT TIME YOU SPEND A NIGHT ON ANCHOVIES VERSUS CRAP FOR EXAMPLE MMHM AND THIS IS RISKY THINK ABOUT IT FROM OUR SIDE. I HAVE FOUND -- COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THIS PUBLIC SECTOR POSITION THAT. YOU KNOW IT THERE'S A A LEVEL OF NERVOUSNESS WHEN YOU'RE LAYING OUT ALL YOUR EXPENDITURES RIGHT SURE. AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING TO BE EMBRACED AND THIS PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT AFFIRMATIVELY. IN A SMART MANNER THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WE HAVE A CONFUSING BUDGET. AND WE HAVE ALREADY PUT A LOT OF THE INFORMATION WE GENERATED ON A PUBLICFACING WEBPAGE WILDLIFE DOT CA DOT GOV. BACKSLASH BUDGET BACKSLASH SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. AND WE'RE WELCOMING THE INPUT AND THAT WEB LINK. AS I MENTIONED WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SCHEDULED I LOVE A CHANCE TO TALK AND SUB TO INSULT THREE ABOUT IT. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT ENGAGEMENT STILL TO BE HAD. THREE THANK YOU. THAT COULD BE TO SWITCH GEARS HERE TO CRAB INTO TESTING. REALLY HAVE A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE BY YOUR DEPARTMENT MISTER DIRECTORS OUT THERE -- WORKING WITH FISHERMEN WHO GENEROUSLY GIVE THEIR TIME TO BE ABLE TO GO CATCH THE SPECIMEN. WORKING WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AND ULTIMATELY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- OVERSEEN THE TESTING. ON I THINK THAT THERE'S STILL SOME GAP OF WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. TO BE IN REGARDS TO THEIR FINDING UNDERSTAND THE DFW WAS -- PROVIDED TO ENHANCE FUNNY BUT I THINK. AGAIN NO THIS IS SEPARATE FROM YOU BUT ALSO YOU'RE ATTACHED TO HIP WITH THE PH I THINK THAT'S THE ONE AREA THAT WE STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IS. HOW TO BE A GIVE THEM ADEQUATE% RESOURCES BID TO COMPLETE THE TESTING ESPECIALLY IN A TIMELY MANNER -- IN AS WITH THE SECTORS TALK ABOUT DEMO CASTED. MY OPINION I THINK THAT WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM. I'M -- THE CRABBERS IS THAT SOME CHALLENGES THERE IN REGARDS THE TIME MIGHT. ANY COMMENTS ON THAT YES THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES THERE. YES THE OUTCOME DEPENDS ON GETTING INFORMATION AND PROCESSING IT QUICKLY. AND OFTEN THAT'S A FUNCTION OF PEOPLE AVAILABLE IN LABS. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY IT'S A CONTINUING AREA OF CONCERN I'D LOVE A CHANCE TO GO OFF LINE TALK TO THE SECRETARY AND OUR COLLEAGUES ELSEWHERE PERFECT. AND KEEP WORKING ON THE TOPIC IT'S GREAT I'M GONNA I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A PARKING LOT JUST SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON IT THANK YOU [inaudible] WHEN ENERGY? I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ANYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE -- FOR MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON RENEWAL AFFORDABLE RENEWABLE -- SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR CALIFORNIANS. IN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT RIGHT -- MAKING NEW SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE TURBINES -- INSENSITIVE OCEAN AREAS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD FOR THE GREATER. GOOD FOR A G. SHE IMPACT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALSO WORKING FOR VERY SENSITIVE HABITATS OFF OF OUR COAST IN HIS SON IMPACTING COMMERCIAL FISHING GROUNDS -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS AND WE WILL BE HAVING THAT HEARING COMING UP ON THE THIRD UP IN EUREKA -- BUT I JUST LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY EITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BOUNCE RIGHT AT A BROAD LEVEL I THINK THE DIRECTOR INDICATED A PRIORITY IN HIS DEPARTMENT. FOR BEING CENTRELINK GAUGE IN THIS MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING. ANDWE HAVE. TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OR ENTITY WITHIN THE RESOURCE AGENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THEIR APPROACH TO THIS THEY'VE DONE SOME LARGE SCALE ENERGY PLANNING ON LAND. AND THEY'RE FOCUSED IN PARTNERING WATER. IS OBVIOUSLY A FEDERAL DIMENSION ON THIS AS WELL -- SO I WELCOME YOUR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THIS AND JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY WITHIN OUR AGENCY. THE ONLY ADDITIONAL THING I'D SAY IS FROM EXPERIENCE. HAVING LIVE THROUGH. MOST OF THE EFFORT TO PERMIT THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ON THE LAND SIDE YEAH. WITH THE RIGHT MAPPING IN PLANNING AND THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE WE'RE TALKING ACROSS OUR OUR BAND WITH. I FOUND THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT KIND DISCUSSION IS IS THE FOOTPRINT QUESTION WHERE DO YOU WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE ASSET. AND IF YOU CAN ENSURE YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT THOUGHTFULLY. YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CAN ACHIEVE BOTH OBJECTIVES. SENSITIVITY TO SPECIES AND HABITAT AND GREENING OUR GRID. AND A LOT OF THAT RESTS ON THE QUESTION AROUND CITING INFOPRINT. ABSOLUTELY AND I WOULD ONLY MENTION ONE OTHER IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS THE FEDERAL MILITARY. AND WE'LL CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERAL FEDERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE DOING TESTING IN TRAINING. I AND WIND ENERGY. ARE PLACED IN THE WRONG -- LOCATION CAN BE REALLY PROBLEMATIC -- TO FLYING THE MILITARY PLANE SO WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THAT AND WE'RE ENGAGING THOSE FOLKS AS WELL. GREAT FOR I THINK THAT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT. WERE ALSO CAN WE FOCUS ON ARE THOSE LINES THAT NEED TO BE BUILT OUT SO FOR LOOKING AT THE NORTH COAST FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE MOST. SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS ON EARTH -- AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THERE TO BE ABLE TO GET WHATEVER ENERGY IS GOING TO BE. DEVELOPED OFF SHORE -- INPUT INTO THE GENERAL GRADE IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY COSTLY BY THE WAY RIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDING THESE TRANSMISSION LINES THROUGH SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE WATERSHEDS -- WHICH ARE -- SALMON BEARING HABITAT. AND SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE -- FORCEFULLY AND WITH ENDANGERED SPECIES I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER AREA THAT WE WE NEED TO BE A FOCUS THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE DIRECTOR'S. OFFICE AS WELL [inaudible] I'M. SETTLEMENT KNOW THAT I YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY -- ON THE SETTLEMENT. HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE -- AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A GREAT COMMUNICATOR WHEN YOU CAN BE ON AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND IN ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HOST IS I CAN MEAN AND MEDIAN WITH -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT ALONG -- WORKING WITH MR OPPENHEIM HE BETTER COME IN AND SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE  AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK. THAT MAY MEAN SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SEASON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN TO BE ABLE TO GET FOLKS OUT IN THE WATER. AND WHAT WE CAN DO IF -- THAT SEASON IS INTERRUPTED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE RUNWAY IF WE LOOK AT A DIFFERENT ARE SHORTER SEASON FOR EXAMPLE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO BE. BUT THERE IS SOME GREAT CONCERN. FOR THE LIVELIHOOD IT'S OUR TOP TIER FISHERY WE HAVE AND THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY OUT THERE AS YOU ALL KNOW AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROACTIVE ON CONVENING A MEETING. OBVIOUSLY WITH A DEPARTMENT AND THOSE WHO WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE SHORTENED SEASON AND OFF. EITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE -- HAVE THAT. NOT WANTING TO BE A TO GET INTO THE DETAIL ON THE SETTLEMENT -- ALL I KNOW HE CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT BUT I THINK TO SOME PROCESS POST YES. I SPENT QUALITY TIME WITH THE BOARD OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION THOSE A LITTLE BIT OF CUSSING INVOLVED YEAH. A DIRECTED SOME AT ME I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I THINK THERE'S A VERY LEGITIMATE. ANXIETY IN THE FLEET. I HAVE BENEFITED FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR INTEREST IN KEEPING THAT IN MIND AS I'M TRYING TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I WOULD ARGUE THE FEDERAL LITIGATION POTENTIALLY IS AN EVEN GREATER RISKS TO CERTAIN INSTABILITY IN THE FLEET. THAT SAID I HAVE COMMITTED TO GO TO THE CRAB WORKING GROUP ON TUESDAY IN PERSON. AND HERE THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS YOU KNOW FIRST HAND. AND I WILL MAKE THE COMMITMENT TO YOU THAT WHATEVER STRUCTURE WORKS BEST FOR YOUR STAKE HOLDERS ALEX REPLIED INFORMATION WHEN I CAN. THAT'S GREAT THINKS MISSIONS DIRECTORTHE LAST ITEM -- I MENTIONED -- INVOLVES A DIFFERENT AGENCY -- BUT NOW THAT S. P. -- ONE HAS FOR MANY MANY YEARS ON FISH PASSAGE IN STATE HIGHWAY PROJECTS -- IN US BUILDING RESILIENT -- RESILIENT LEE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE ARE GOING THROUGH SOME VERY SENSITIVE WATERSHEDS THAT WE ARE NOT **** UP THOSE SENSITIVE STREAMS AND THAT'S ANOTHER PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE CONTROLLING THE DESTINY BUT THOSE PROJECTS LOOK LIKE. MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE HIGHWAY PROJECTS ARE FISH FRIENDLY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE SEE FISH PASSAGE -- INSPECTION SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE MR DOLLAR REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY -- IN OUR ENTIRE WATER SYSTEM THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE EXPLORING. IT WILL TOUCH OBVIOUSLY THE SHOP OF THE DIRECTOR BY -- THIS WILL ALSO INVOLVE CALTRANS AS WELL -- IN BUILDING THAT INTO THEIR PLANS -- WITH THESE SP ONE DOLLAR CERTAINLY MOVING FORWARD AS WELL. PLEASE OTHERS SAY BROADLY ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS TO INSURE -- CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN NATURI SOURCE AGENCY IN THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THAT FUNDING THAT WE'RE GENERATING TO IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IS DONE THOUGHTFULLY -- AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW ALL THOSE MITIGATION DOLLARS GET SPENT ON ACTUALLY PROTECTING THE RESOURCE. WHETHER IT'S A FORESTER THE WILDLIFE ASH I AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE'S SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE WHAT WE'RE DOING -- I'M REALLY PASSIONATE I KNOW DIRECTOR BOTTOMS REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WILDLIFE MIGRATION AND WILDLIFE MIGRATION CORRIDORS -- AND SO YOU BRING UP ONE EXAMPLE OF OF THAT MIGRATION CORRIDOR BUT BOY YOU KNOW ONE PRIORITY I HAVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING THIS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. IMPROVING -- ARE REESE ARE NATURI SOURCES AND HABITAT VERSES IMPACTING THEM NEGATIVELY. THIS USUALLY SECTOR AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT BECAUSE LOOK -- OVER THE DECADES WE HAVE SOME REALLY OLD CRAPPY CULVERTS THAT HAVE GREATLY IMPACTED NEGATIVELY -- THE WATER FLOW IN A SPAWNING ABILITY OF SALMON -- IN -- EIGHTEEN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE A BIG PRIORITY BEEN FOCUSING ON SPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE pRESOURCES AND WE CAN CONTROL THAT DESTINY SO THAT'S REALLY WONERFUL FOR YOU TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE LOVE TO BE A FOLLOW UP WITH. YOUR NEXT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPACT -- THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE NAKED IN THE FUTURE. MR DIRECTOR AND OTHERS IN AND YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THAT WHAT HE SAW TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY FOLLOW UP UP FROM THE COMMITTEE MR SOON. JUST A ONE ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO REACH OUT TO THAT WHEN WE HAD THE CAR FIRE UP IN -- SHASTA COUNTY WE HAD -- SECRETARY -- PURDUE AND THEN WAS RYAN ZEKI ALONG WITH JOHN LAYERED AND THE CAL FIRE. JUST WANT -- TO COURAGE YOU DO YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST LANDOWNER IN THE STATE OF OUR HABITAT AREAS IS THE FOR SERVICE AND AND OUR ABILITY BILL TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME OUT WITH A COMMON GOAL IS GOING. TO REQUIRE YOU YOUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THA AND I WANNA BE PARTNER WITH YOU ON THAT. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING THEM AT THE TABLE AND WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITIES THAT THE SECRETARY LAIRD WORKED ON SO. WE COULD EXPAND ON THAT -- TOO DO GOOD FOREST HEALTH TO IMPROVE OUR WATERSHEDS. YEAH I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND I TOOK NOTE OF YOUR COMMENTS I IN ANOTHER FORM REGARDING LONG TERM STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS ON NATIONAL FOREST LANDS -- WE NEED THE NASH -- AND USDA HAS TO BE A PARTNER ON THE GOOD FOLKS WORKING THERE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS US I MEAN WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE COORDINATION. WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT WHILE FIRE SAFETY AND THEN AS YOU'VE CONNECTED THE DOTS ALSO HELPFUL -- FOR HEADWATERS IN RIVER HABITATS FOR THAT MIGRATING SALMON. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER ANSWER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR TELLING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR UP YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY. I THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WE'RE TRANSITIONING BETWEEN OUR PANELISTS WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT I HIS NAME IS TOM WEST LOW HE'S THE CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR THE JOINT COMMITTEE -- NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING WITHOUT HIS INCREDIBLE WORK AND I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FULLY SELF THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER WESTOVER. RD WORK SIR. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GIVE YOU A STATE OF THE STATE ON ALL ISSUES ON ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE SALMON FISHERY WE HAVE FOUR OF THE BEST EXPERTS IN THE GOLDEN STATE HERE WITH US TODAY. WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WALK IN THEM AND HAVE THEM COME FORWARD PLEASE FORGIVE ME WELCOMING NO OPPENHEIM IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION. JOHN MCMANUS AND CHECK THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOLDEN STATE SAM ASSOCIATION WE'RE GONNA WELCOME JIM ANDERSON HE IS A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN FISHERMAN AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA SALMON STAMP COMMITTEE. AND WHO WE WOULD NOT HAVE A PEN WITHOUT MISTER RICK IT'S MIKE RICKETS WHO IS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA SALMON STAMP COMMITTEE WE WELCOME THE GENTLEMAN HERE TO THE COMMITTEE WE WILL GO BE GOING IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER NO. ONE JOHN JIM AND MIKE EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS FIVE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT. I'M SORRY BUT I AM AND THEY HAVE TO GO AND VOTE BACK IMMEDIATELY THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. FIGURES WAS MISCHIEF MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIR. AND ANOTHER DELI IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING THE CIVIC RECEPTION LAST NIGHT -- THAT WAS -- TREMENDOUS EVENT THANKS TO OUR VOLUNTEERS AND AND ARE EXCELLENT STAFF. AND TO TOM AS WELL SO THANK YOU -- MY NAME'S NO OFTEN I'M I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. AND AS AS WE'VE HEARD. EARLIER IN THIS PROCEEDING THERE ARE THERE'S BAD NEWS AND GOOD NEWS TO SHARE -- IN IN OUR IN OUR DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS IN STORE FOR US IN BOTH THE SALMON FISHERY THIS YEAR AND IN SAM AND RELATEDISSUES THAT WE ARE. DEALING WITH IN THIS YEAR IN THE YEARS AHEAD -- IT'S A COMPLEX PICTURE IT'S ONE WHERE WE ARE EMPOWERED TO CARVE A PATH FOR OURSELVES TO PROSPERITY AND TO THE RENEWAL REJUVENATION OF OUR MOST ICONIC FISHERY THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA. KING SALMON FISHERY -- THEY'VE THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING TIMES IN COMMERCIAL FISHERIES LATELY AS WE KNOW -- BUT BUT THIS THREE FOOT FISH IS RESILIENT IT'S BEEN HERE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. BUT RECENT EVENTS -- INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED IMPACTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY -- HUMAN MISMANAGEMENT AND AND FOLLY AND GREED FRANKLY HAVE BEEN -- DEVASTATING OUR FISHERIES THE HIJACKING OF THE FEDERAL POLICY APPARATUS -- IN PARTICULAR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR DELIVERING MORE WATER AWAY FROM FISH AND TWO OTHER USER GROUPS. IT HAS BEEN WREAKING HAVOC IN RECENT PAST DESTROYING OUR OUR CENTER VALLEY SALMON RUNS OUT AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO TAKE BACK OUR PROCESS. WE COULD LOSE IT ALL -- AND AND THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION MANY OF US HAVE ALSO LEARNED. RECENTLY WITH REVULSION THAT ANOTHER FEDERAL FOLLY THE AT THE FEDERAL THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION -- IS GOING TO RESULT POTENTIALLY IN THE THE PERMITTING IMPORTING OF GMO SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME A PRODUCT GENETICALLY ENGINEERED -- FOR EXCESSIVE GROWTH A IS GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY IN OUR MARKETS ARE IT WILL IF WE DON'T. EITHER FEDERALLY OR IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE LABELING IN ORDER TO LET CONSUMERS KNOW THAT THIS PRODUCT. IT IS WHAT IT IS. THE A. FRANKEN FISH AND NOT THE WILD -- THE FISH THAT THEY HAVE COME TO LOVE AND CHERISH -- THEN WE COULD BE DOING OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR FISHERIES A DISSERVICE -- I FOR ONE AM WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS -- FOR ALL OF US -- IT CAN'T JUST BE A Q. R. CODE IT NEEDS TO SAY LOUD AND CLEAR GMO FISH. FARMED. AND AND IT NEEDS THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY. THERE IS A BRIGHT SPOT THIS YEAR. THE THE COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHERY IS GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FISHING OPPORTUNITY THAN ANY YEAR IN RECENT MEMORY -- AND THE THE REASON WHY MAY SURPRISE. SOME OF THOSE IN DC OR DOWN HIGHWAY NINETY NINE BUT FOR THOSE OF US IN HE ROOM THE REASON IS CLEAR. FISH NEED WATER. AND THE WINNER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN FISH GOT THAT WATER AND WE'RE GOING TO BE. REVELING IN THAT BOUNTY THIS YEAR THE SEASON ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'VE CRAFTED FOR THE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN THE OCEAN HAVEN'T BEEN FINALIZED YET. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL'S WEBSITE -- THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR THE FISHERIES IF THAT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE COUNTING MONTHS ON THE WATER INSTEAD OF WEEKS. WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY REALLY EXTRAORDINARY RELEASE NATURE'S BOUNTY WILL BE SHARED WITH THE PEOPLE THIS YEAR AND THAT'S A REASON TO CELEBRATE. THERE IS THE OTHER REASONS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT SEVEN THIS YEAR INCLUDING A COUPLE KEY PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT I AND OTHERS WILL SPEAK TO A LITTLE LATER. I THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ONCE AGAIN -- YOUR TRUE FRIEND TO SALMON AND TO SALMON FISHERMEN -- HOWEVER OUR OUR CELEBRATION WILL BE SHORT LIVED IF WE DON'T LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE RECENT PAST -- BOTH GOOD LESSONS IN BAD TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT OUR RIVERS WE NEED TO APPLY THOSE LESSONS IN A COUPLE KEY ISSUES. WE NEED TO KEEP THE DELTA TUNNELS. OUT OF ANY PORTFOLIO APPROACH THIS IS THE POSITION OF OUR ORGANIZATION IT'S BEEN FOR YEARS YOU CANNOT CARVE UP THE DELTA. IN ORDER TO SECURE WATER FUTURE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THOUGH THE THE REGIONS IN THE SOUTH AGRICULTURAL MUNICIPAL WATER USERS MUST FIND ALTERNATIVES THEY CAN IT'S BEEN PROVEN. IT'S GONNA BE COSTLY BUT IT CAN'T COME AT OUR EXPENSE WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY LOST ENOUGH. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND IT'S DELTA PLAN UPDATE. THE PHASE ONE PROCESS WAS A NIGHTMARE. IT'S BEEN POLITICALLY COMPROMISE AND YET DESPITE THAT FACT THE WATER BOARD. CAME OUT WITH THE FIRST STRONG -- PROTECTIVE. WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN FOR THE DELTA. IN THIRTY YEARS PERHAPS EVER SOME OF SAID THIS IS THE BEST THING THE WATER BOARD EVER DONE IN ITS HISTORY. AND NOW THAT'S COMROMISED -- AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SIGNS THAT IF IF IF IF THINGS PROCEED AS THEY'RE GOING AND WE WILL LOSE TRANSPARENCY WILL LOSE THE PUBLIC NATURE OF THIS PROCESS. VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CAN WORK. IF THEIR PUBLIC. AND IF THEY ARE. IF THEY VERIFIABLY IT HERE TO APPROPRIATE. MINIMUM FLOW STANDARDS. SO WE CAN GET THERE -- BUT IT'S A IT'S A CRITICAL MOMENT THERE IN THE FISH NEED THIS WATER WE GRILL WATERS ON THE TABLE. IT'S TIME TO KEEP IT THERE SO. WE WON'T WE WON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT ON BEHALF OF THESE FISH AND THE MEN WOMEN WHO. FIVE THE OCEANS IN ORDER TO CAPTURE IT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENJOY -- AND AN ORGANIZATION STANDS READY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH YOU SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING FISHING. WITH AS MANY OF YOU AS I CAN ON THE OCEAN THIS YEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH STUFF I'M VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WILL HOLD. UNTIL WE WENT TO THE ENTIRE SET OF PANELISTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MINISTER FOR YOURS YOUR FIVE MINUTES FROM THE ONE IN A PROMPT WE WELCOME YOU SIR THANKS THANKS. EXCUSE ME. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME SETTLEMENT DOLLARS SOME WOMEN STONE SENATOR MAGUIRE. TOM I'M JOHN MCMANUS PRESS ASSOCIATION I'M ACTUALLY -- JUST CUED UP -- TO ECHO A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE THEMES THAT -- NO IT JUST SPOKE ABOUT ALTHOUGH WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS FOR THE MOMENT WITH GOOD WATER YEARS -- WE WERE. BADLY SCARRED DURING THE LAST DROUGHT AND WE WANT TO TAKE STEPS NOW TO AVOID THAT IN THE FUTURE -- SACRAMENTO BEE HEADLINE FROM JANUARY NEWSOME INHERITS A WHOLE BUNCH OF HEADACHES DESPITE. LAST MINUTE WATER DEALS BY BROWN SOME HAVE SAID BECAUSE OF LAST MINUTE WATER DEALS BY BROWN -- TOPIC OF DEBATE THIS GOES TO THE BSA IS THAT WHERE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE GOLDEN GATE SALMON ASSOCIATION AND ALLIES PREPARED AN ANALYSIS OF THE V. ESSAYS WHICH WERE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU. AND BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE CONDITIONS WORSE FOR THE BAY DELTA RIVERS SALMON AND WILDLIFE -- WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES THERE WERE OTHER -- CONSERVATION GROUPS. CLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS INCLUDING TROUT UNLIMITED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE BAY INSTITUTE. ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN AMERICAN RIVERS THEY BASICALLY FOUND SIMILAR THINGS TO WHAT WE DID THE TOP FINDINGS OR THE AMOUNT OF WATER. ALLEGED TO BE SHIFTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN THESE NEW VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. SHE DOESN'T MEET THE LEGAL AND SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE BOARD IT DOESN'T MEAN THESE -- VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CAN'T YET BE NEGOTIATED AND MODIFIED HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE BUT AS THEY STAND TODAY THEY'RE NOT THERE YET. THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OVER WHAT CONSTITUTES BASELINE CONDITIONS THAT'S IMPORTANT. IN THE PROPOSALS ARE UNCLEAR ON HOW TO PROTECT ANY ADDITIONAL WATER FROM BEING DIVERTED IN THE DELTA SO ONE OF THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE COULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL WATER PUT INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY ONLY LOOK TO LOSE IT IN THE DAY -- RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS DOWN THERE MEANWHILE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING TO INCREASE DELTA PUMPING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. MODELING BY THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION SHOWS THAT THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT FLOWS. COMBINED WITH WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOW PROPOSING WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER FLOWING THROUGH THE DELTA WE MAY GET MORE OF THESE BLUE GREEN ALGAE OUTBREAKS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS PICTURE HERE. THAT'S SHUT UP -- NEAR OAKLEY IN THE DELTA BLUE GREEN ALGAE -- FOR LACK OF FRESH WATER LACK OF FLUSHING FLOWS THAT WAS DURING THE DROUGHT WE COULD BE BACK IN THERE VERY SOON. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS ARE ALL REALLY JUST SO THEY CAN SEND MORE WATER SOUTH TO THE VERY ARID WESTERN SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY. I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO THE NUMBERS I JUST WANT TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT THE RED. THIS IS FROM THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION THIS IS THEIR ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH LESS WATER WOULD SEE. IN THE DELTA UNDER PROPOSALS CURRENTLY UNDER THE TABLE OR ON THE TABLES WHEN I MEANT TO SAY. YEAH THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF WATER THAT WE COULD STAND TO LOSE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. SO ONE SOLUTION -- THE WE'D LIKE TO HELP YOUR ADS FOR YOUR HELP ON IS TO SUPPORT SP ONE OF OURS SENATOR TONI ATKINS BILL. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT WORKERS AND CONSUMERS FROM THE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES OF RECKLESS DEREGULATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS BILL IS FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING US. I WOULD TURN MY ATTENTION TO WELL THE SITE'S RESERVOIR PROPOSAL JUST FOR A QUICK SECOND -- AND JUST POINT OUT WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAIL THAT -- YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF ROSIE THINGS ABOUT SITES OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS LETTER SENT BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. BACK IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN KLAY SAID -- HIGHER BYPASS FLOWS WOULD BE NEEDED BEFORE SITES COULD DIVERT -- WHAT CDF W. IS CALLING ON IS ABOUT TWICE THE BY PASS FLOWS ENVISIONED BY THE? SITES PROJECT AUTHORITY. A AND DOES SO FOR THE SITE'S FOLKS HAVE NOT TAKEN THESE PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO HEART AND THEY NEED TO GOING FORWARD -- FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE OF OUR FAVORIT TOPICS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ME ADDRESS EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN HERE. AND THAT IS -- THE FEATHER RIVER BELOW THE ORVILLE DAM AND THE HOT WATER THAT'S POURING INTO THE RIVER OUT OF THE THERMAL LIDO AFTER BAY -- RIGHT NOW -- ALL PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO FIX THIS BUT IT'S NOT BEEN FIXED. SO I JUST WANT. TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR SCOTT WEINER AND HE'S BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE SOME LANGUAGE NSP. SIXTY NINE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY -- PROMPT AN ACCELERATION IN THE FIX ON THAT PROBLEM IF D. W. R. ISN'T GONNA MOVE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE. GIVE IT A LITTLE NUDGE AND THAT'S WHAT S. B. SIXTY NINE WE HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT THAT. AND NONE OF MY PRESENTATIONS WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A A FEW SHOT SO THERE'S A FISH SHOP. IS MY GREATEST THANK YOU SO MUCH ALWAYS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND BRINGING THE POWER POINT AS WELL GREAT REALLY REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. NOW TO TURN OVER TO MISTRANSLATED SO MUCH COMING. I IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CONFERENCE HIM SAME COMMITTEE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AT THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO STEP OUT AND VOTE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU HEADS UP AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MY NAME IS JIM ANDERSON ON ON CALIFORNIA'S SAM SAM COMMITTEE. THE OTHER THING THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF HIS THE CAL BARGING PROGRAM AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THAT. THE MOST INTERESTING THING THAT EVERY YEAR THAT WE DID BARGING DOWN RIVER WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO IN THE SYSTEM HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE FISH OUT A RELEASE THE FISH WERE RELEASED EFFICIENT -- LEARNING WHAT TIME IS TIDES OR WHATEVER WOULD BE THE BEST FOR THE FASHION. BY DOING THAT EVERY YEAR WE ARE ABLE TO LIVE THAT. I'VE HEARD THAT -- THURS -- SOME OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE HERE TO TRY TO INFLUENCE WHERE WE DO RELEASE FISH OUT OF THE TRUCKS THIS YEAR IN CASE ---WE'RE DUMPING DRUNK FISH INTO A BAD SPOT. PLACE WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF STRIPERS BE NICE TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO DUMP THE FISH. RATHER THAN RIGHT IN THIS SPOT. IF WE DUMP A TRUCKLOAD OF FISH RIGHT ON TOP OF THE STRIKERS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST SUMMER -- YOU KNOW. WE AS FISHERMEN DON'T CARE OF THE BIRDS CRAWFISH STRIPERS SEALS ARE WHALES EAT THE BABY FISH WE DON'T CARE OF THE SEA LIONS ARE THE KILLER WHALE THE THE BIG FISH COMING BACK IN THE RIVER ALL WE REALLY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PUT N A FISH IN THE RIVER. SO -- FISH IN THE OCEAN SO THAT WE HAVE A RETURNING FISH IN THE RIVER WE HAVE A GOOD OCEAN FISHERIES FOR BOTH SPORT AND COMMERCIAL. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SEASON STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR THE OCEAN ABUNDANCE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS YEAR -- THE OCEAN ABUNDANCES ISN'T A HUNDRED AND IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'VE DONE THROUGH THE DROUGHT -- WE HOPE TO GET TO THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS RATHER THAN WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- THIS YEAR WITH THE AMOUNT OF SNOW IN THE MOUNT A RAIN WE'RE HOPING FOR GOOD THINGS FOR FOR THE YEARS TO COME. BUT WE STILL LOOK AT THE FISHERIES IS BACK N NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WE HAD FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETEEN VOTES FIVE HUNDRED AND TWO VESSELS CAUGHT 50% OF THE FISH TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR VESSELS CUT 90% OF THE FISH. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX VESSELS THAT LANDED A FISH THERE'S FIFTY SIX BEZEL THAT LANDED 50%. THERE'S TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN VESSELS THAT LANDED 90% OF THE FISH. THAT'S A 90% REDUCTION IN THE FISHERIES SINCE THEN -- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH SALMON STAMP IS PUT FISH IN THE OCEAN SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OCEAN FISHERIES AND AND TRY TO DO THAT? THIS 90% REDUCTION THE REAL PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THAT IS IT'S NOT ONLY THE 90% REDUCTION IN THE FISHERIES. BUT IT'S A 90% REDUCTION ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE ICE MACHINES FEEL MECHANICS HERE STORES HOLLOW FACILITIES ALL THOSE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE OCEAN FISHERIES. AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED REAL PROBLEM WITH US -- LAST THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS IS. WE SEE THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE DANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY IS COMMON. SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO WITH SALMON STAMP AT LEAST BE AT THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO TALK WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE SCENARIOS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING OUT TO SEA. OUR WHAT THE RATINGS OR SNOW RATES AND THE FLOW RATES WOULD BE AND WHAT KIND OF SEDIMENT DEPOSIT THOSE KIND OF THINGS WOULD HAPPEN DURING THE SYSTEM -- WITH THE DM REMOVALS -- WE WE TO TRY TO HELP MOVE FISHER DO SOMETHING IN THE HATCHERIES OR WHATEVER -- TO TO HAVE AN OCEAN FISHERIES WALL THAT PROJECT IS GOING ON WE DON'T WANT TO SEE REMOVAL OF THE DAMS AND AND LOSE A COUPLE YEARS OF OF STOCKS OUT OF CLAMS SYSTEM AND HAVE NO OCEAN FISHERIES SO WE WANT TO BE. PROACTIVE AND TRY TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT NOW SO WE CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF SCENARIOS AND UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHERE THAT FISHERIES -- MIGHT END UP WITH THE REMOVAL OF OF THAT. TOO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION WITH THAT WE WANT TO MAKE RECORDS WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN THE CAL CALIFORNIA. SEVEN STAFF COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR HAVING US HERE AND I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PREVIOUS TALK. TO THEM THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE AND WE APPRECIATE THE RENEWAL OF THE SALMON STAMP. PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH. OUR FRIENDS AND AND THAT THE FUNDS THAT WERE AVAILABLE -- MAKE THIS SALMON -- ADVENTURE. WORK IS THIS IS JUST A LOT OF WORK. AND A LOT OF THE DEMAND FOR MAN POWER TO MAKE IT WORK WITH -- THROUGH YUR HELP IN THE LAND BASE OPENED OVER A WORK WITH THE CALCULATION WILDLIFE SO. WE APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP THAT YOU'RE DOING FORCE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ONE THING IN PARTICULAR IS. THE OF THE COATED WIRE TAG RESULTS HIS MESSAGES FOR FIVE YEARS AND IF WE COULD HAVE THOSE MORE UP TO DATE SO WE HAVE. TO ON TIME. WE CAN WORK WITH WATER FLOWS IN THEY COULD WEAR TAGS AND PROBABLY PRODUCE. BETTER RESULTS WITH THE FISH THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE THE HATCHES I THINK YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT WITH THE SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE DOING WITH TIME RELEASES. NIGHT RELEASES THINGS IT SO THAT WE KEEP THE PREDATION DOWN. AND THOSE THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT TAKES A COORDINATION WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE WITH THE TRUCKING AND THE BARGING IN. WITH THE REAL SO THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT OVERALL I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY A WITH **** WATER AND AND THIS YEAR'S WATER. MAYBE TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF GOOD FISHING SO. MAYBE THAT WILL WEAKEN A KEEP THE SALMON COME ON WHY WOULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. TO KEEP MORE PROJECTS GOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ROLE WITH YOU GUYS ARE DOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR FOR BEING HERE GIVING THAT UPDATE. IS LITTLE MORE POSITIVE AND SOMETIMES WE'VE SEEN AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AND IT AND IT'S INTERESTING AS WE NARROW DOWN ON SOME OF THE ISSUES. IT'S GOOD THAT WERE ABLE TO GET. BE ON SOME OF THE CATASTROPHIC THINGS WE'VE BEEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH AND IN DWN SOME OF THE DETAILS ALTHOUGH I SHARE. YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH THE HOT WATER DUMP THE THERMAL LIDO AND WHY THAT. THAT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO TO CHANGE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CERTAINLY. NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND I AGREE HAVING THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE FISHER THE SAM SAM PROGRAMMING FISHMAN AT THE TABLE AS WE DEAL WITH THE IMPACTS OF CLOSING THE DAMS UP ON THE KLAMATH AND THOSE ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS. AS THEY'RE THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE DELTA. THOSE ARE. KIND OF ITS AT AT THEN FLOWED IF YOU WILL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE THE DELTA AND CONVERSATION. AROUND WATER OFTEN LEAVES OUT THE IMPACT ON THE FISHERIES INDUSTRY UNFORTUNATELY. AND PAYING ATTENTION TO HYDROLOGY HOW FISH MOVE WHAT WHAT THAT ASPECT IS THE DELTA IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT NURSERY. FOR THE OFFSHORE FISHING INDUSTRY AND WE WE OFTEN LOSE THAT IMPACT OR LOSE THAT DOUCETTE UNDERSTANDING -- THE GMO ISSUE IS AN INTERESTING ONE WHAT WHAT IS THE FEDERAL ACTION THAT IS. PENDING OR HAPPENING THAT WOULD START TO OPEN THAT UP. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTIONS SO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY APPROVED THE IMPORTATION OF OF OF PRODUCT CALLED. LOCKWOOD VANTAGE. WHICH IS PRODUCED BY AQUA BOUNTY. INCORPORATED BELIEVE STILL BASED IN MASSACHUSETTS -- AND THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS A IS AN AMALGAM OF OF OF ATLANTIC SALMON. CHINOOK SALMON AN ARCTIC CHAR -- IT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF OF SCRUTINY LITIGATION ETCETERA THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THAT THE THE THE CERTIFICATION OF THIS PRODUCT IS. SAFE FOR ORDINARY RECOGNIZES SAFE GRASS -- IS IS RESULTING IN THIS THIS IMPORTATION -- LOOPHOLE IF YOU WILL. WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR LABELING AND THAT THAT PRESENTS THE HEALTH QUESTION BUT I THINK IT ALSO PRESENTS. AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER THE THE QUESTION OF MARKETING AND INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT STATES MAY NEED. TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IF THE FEDS DON'T STEP UP BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME OF OUR OUR FRIENDS IN CONGRESS ARE. MAKING THIS -- KNOWN AMONG THEIR COLLEAGUES AND SOLUTIONS MAY BECOME. OKAY THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED AT SOME LABELING ISSUES AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS USUALLY END UP KIND OF LEAVING IT BECAUSE OF SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IF THAT'S NOT HAPPENING I I I KNOW -- LABELING IS A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT BUT WHAT'S AT STAKE IS. NOT JUST INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS BUT POTENTIALLY THE HEALTH OF OUR OWN INDUSTRIES HERE IN IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A VERY THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND APROPOS OF OTHER PARTS OF THE CONVERSATION IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING THINGS THAT [inaudible] OUR ANTITHETICAL DESTRUCTIVE TO WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT WE HAVE TO BE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO STEP IN AND BOTH THE REGULATIONS OR HAVE THE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO HEAD OFF SOME THINGS THAT WE KNOW WILL BE HARMFUL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. ABSOLUTELY AND AND AND CERTAINLY WILL WILL LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING CAR TO LOOK INTO THIS DEEPLY WITH YOU YOUR STAFF AND AND WILL -- WILL BE IN TOUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT MR BUT THE PRESSURE PLEASE DON'T. THANK YOU UP. TO GOD THAT IS ONE OF MAKE A STATEMENT FIRST AND THEN FOLLOW THE QUESTION SO YOU KNOW AS LEGISLATORS. YES ON THIS COMMITTEE SAID ON WATER PARKS WILDLIFE MOM SEVERAL DIFFERENT SELECT COMMITTEES IN. AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE I MEAN IT'S A BALANCING OUT FOR A LEGISLATOR I MEAN MOST OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME TO US ARE. FOCUSED ON THEIR ISSUE. SO YOU OBVIOUSLY THIS GROUP IS FOCUSED ON THE FISHERY. AND AS JOHN MENTIONED ANY TOLD ME WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT SITES AS WORKERS HE KNOWS I SUPPORT IT AND I THINK IT'S HEALTHY HEALTHY CONVERSATION TO HAVE. SO WE'VE INCREASED THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA DOUBLED IT SINCE THE LAST TIME WE INCREASED THE WATER. AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. SO AS A LEGISLATOR NOT ONLY ME BUT OTHER LEGISLATORS REPRESENT IN THE VALLEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY THAT THEY REPRESENT I AM ALWAYS SEEKING YOUR BE TALK ABOUT FIRE BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MY WATERSHED IN MY COMMUNITIES AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS. THAT I FOCUS ON BECAUSE THAT'S MOST PRESSING THING. FOR FOR MY CONSTITUENCY WELL ALL OF US OTHERS SIMPLY ALL EIGHTY OF US HAVE SOME ISSUE THAT'S IN OUR BACKYARD THAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR WERE TRYING TO CORRECT. BUT AS A LEGISLATOR AS A HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE WHOLE CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE DECISIONS THAT ARE REALLY TOUGH TO MAKE WHETHER WE'RE GONNA. ADD STORAGE ARE WE GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THERMAL LEGAL ARE WE GONNA THIN ARE FORCED. ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFECATING ALONG OUR RIVERS AND LEAVING SYRINGES AND ALL KINDS OF HEALTH ISSUES HONOR EMITTERS OF MILLION THINGS WE WORK ON SO I AND I TRY TO TIME COME UP WITH AS A LEGISLATOR AS OF APPROACH OF WHERE CAN I MOVE. THE NEEDLE IN THE FURTHEST CORRECTION TO AND TRY TO KEEP AS MANY PARTIES HAPPY AS I CAN WHILE STILL. MAKING A LOGICAL GOOD DECISION THAT AND IMPACTS AND HELPS OUR ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME SO I JUST STAGE THAT THIS QUESTION WITH. WHAT IS THE BALANCE? AN INMATE AT PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES AND SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE THAT BALANCE DECISION. NOT ONLY FOR MY DISTRICT BUT FOR THE WHOLE OF CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND AND SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE SOLUTION TO DO WE BUILD WHAT WAS STORAGE WITH THE THERMAL LEGAL ISSUES WITH. SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA WHAT YOU'RE WHAT IF YOU WERE MY POSITION HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE FACED. NOT JUST FOCUSED ON ONE ISSUE. I'LL TAKE A STAB AT THAT WITH ANY MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THERE'S ALWAYS THE DRAFTY I ARE YEAH YES IF IT'S A BIG ENOUGH PROJECT AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE. AND CITY OF W. WHO HAS SALMON EXPERTS HAVE OPINED. ABOUT SITES AND IT SEEMS THAT THE SITES JOINT PROJECT AUTHORITY. BASICALLY JUST NEEDS TO TAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO HEART GO BACK AND REWORK THE THE I. YES AND LET'S SEE WHERE THE CARDS FALL THEY'RE NOT SAYING DON'T BUILD IT THEY'RE JUST. PUTTING SOME SIDE BOARDS ON SOME SUGGESTED MITIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT DOESN'T HARM SALMON ANYMORE THAN THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN HARMED AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF SO IT'S NOT A BLACK OR WHITE EITHER WAR. IT'S A PROBABLY YES WITH SIDE BOARDS IS HOW I UNDERSTAND CITY OF W'S POSITION HERE. ANYONE ELSE ON THE PANEL PLEASE MISS ROBIN AND CERTAINLY IT JUST JUST WITH RESPECT -- SOME OF OUR DAILY TO THE TO THE NOTION OF BALANCE. WITHOUT QUESTION POPULATIONS ARE INCREASING AND WITHOUT QUESTION THE POPULATION OF OF SALMON FISHERMEN AS AS JIM ANDERSON -- ATTESTED TO HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY I WOULD SUBMIT THAT. THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A RESTORATION OF BALANCE. IN IN THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDING FISH FOR FISHING COMMUNITIES AND pIMPORTANT RESOURCE AS YOU POINTED OUT INYOUR OPENING COMMENTS. IT'S CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND INLAND IN UPLAND AREAS THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE. THE LARGEST TRANSFER OF BIOMASS TWO IN THE WATER IT WEIGHS ANYWHERE. IN THE WORLD IS A HEALTHY SALMON RUNS. LIENS OF POUNDS OF OCEAN NUTRIENTS BINGLE DEPOSITED. INTO FORESTS AND AND AND AND VALLEYS AND PLAINS. ARMED WITH NEW ON ON THE THE NOTION OF CONSTRUCTING SITES I THINK WE WE NEED TO SEE A NEW D. E. R. -- WE NEED TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL. SCRUTINY ON WHAT THE IMPACTS TO OTHER RIVERS WOULD BE -- TRINITY RIVER IMPACTS -- THAT ARTS ELUCIDATED IN IN THE P. E. I. R. IT'S IS IT ADMITTED. MISTAKES MADE IN THE MODELING -- THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IT WE NEED TO THROTTLE BACK THERE'S NO RUSH. PROP ONE FUNDS WILL BE THERE. SO GET IT RIGHT WE NEED TO GET THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT -- UP TO THE STANDARD THAT THAT WE WILL DEMAND -- IN ORDER FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT. NOTHING'S OFF THE TABLE BUT TERMS OF BALANCE THE SCIENCE NEEDS TO BE. AT THE FOREFRONT [inaudible] RETURNS. IN TERMS OF BALANCE WE NEED TO GET FOR SALMON STAMP WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THE FOUR MILLION ENHANCEMENT FISH TO WE USED TO HAVE -- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DUMP THEM IN THE OCEAN AND ALLOW THEM TO RETURN AND BE IN THE OCEAN FISHERIES DAN AND RIVER FISHERIES. AND AS AS THE SYSTEM REBUILDS AS WE GET BETTER SEASONS THAN THAN WE CAN DEVELOP OTHER THINGS BUT THESE ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE DROP IN THERE SHOWING GOOD RESULTS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GET BACK TO OUR FOUR MILLION ENHANCEMENT FISH SO WE COULD. PUT HIM SOMEWHERE WHERE WE THINK IS THE BEST PLACE TO PUT IT. PLEASE YEAH DOES ONE MAKE A FOLLOW UP CALL I BASICALLY STAYED THE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS THIS FOR A DIFFICULT POSITION AS A AS A LEGISLATOR WHO CARES ABOUT ALL THOSE ISSUES. AND I I KNOW I WANNA HEALTHY. FISHERY AND I ALSO WANT FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE FOOD THAT I CAN EAT. AND I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT BALANCE OUT AS A LEGISLATOR IN THOSE ARE DIFFICULT THINGS. AND AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE AND I LOVE WORKING WITH YOU ALL. AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT DO WHAT THEY DO I ALSO LOVE FARMERS TO PRODUCE FOOD I CAN EAT AND SO THERE'S A THERE'S A BALANCE TRY TO STRIKE AND THAT'S WHY THE FORCE THAT. PLACE WHERE. WE HAVE THE BILL THE BILL AND I'VE BEEN VERY FROM ANY OF THESE IS WITH THE FOR SERVICE AND AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD FIRE SUPPRESSION FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. IT'S NOT RIGHT WASN'T THE LIGHTNING WOULD STRIKE IN OUR FORCE WOULD BURN. EVERY TWELVE YEARS HISTORY WILL SHOW US. AND WE'VE MESSED THAT PROCESS UP AND NOW WE NEED TO GET BACK IN THERE AND CORRECT THAT PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT IF WE DO GOOD MANAGEMENT OF OUR OF OUR FOREST WE WILL INCREASE THE YIELD OF WATER. AT THE TIME WE WANTED. AND AND HAVE GOOD CLEAN WATER AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON BUT I JUST SHARE WITH YOU MY FRUSTRATIONS OF TRYING TO BE A LEGISLATOR THAT ACTUALLY CAN HOLISTICALLY BALANCE THIS AWESOME GREAT STATE THAT GOD GAVE US WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE ALL FACED WITH AND TRY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL THE INTERESTED PARTY SO I JUST BROUGHT THAT OUT NOT FORM TO JUST. KIND OF GIVE YOU SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION AND AND I ALWAYS CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO HEY DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE JUST YOUR PROBLEM HELPME FIX THE HOLISTIC PROBLEMS THAT I THAT I'M FACED WITH. AND NOT ONLY JUST ME BUT EVERY IN THEIR DISTRICT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO WAR BASICALLY SOMETIMES YOU WIN AND SOMETIMES YOU LOSE. AND A BETTER OFF IT'S BETTER IF WE ALL GIVE A LITTLE BIT AND FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL STAY HERE AND THRIVE SO. SHAKE YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SOMEONE VERY GRATEFUL. BUT I DID ASK -- THE THE PANEL ABOUT -- ONE TUNNEL VERSUS TWO TUNNELS -- AND THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF TALK AT SINCE THERE'S GONNA BE A FOCUS OF GOING DOWN TO ONE TUNNEL. THOUGHT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT -- WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET A READ FROM THE EXPERTS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TODAY ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL. PLEASE MISS ROBIN. ALTON DO YOU BRIEF THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX ISSUE BUT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR BRING ATTENTION TO THE TO THIS -- EMERGING CONCEPT OF OF ONE TUNNEL. WITH WITHOUT QUESTION AND WITHOUT HESITATION. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT CARVING UP THE DELTA THE THE CONSTRUCTION ALONE COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO THIS CRITICAL AREA FOR FOR JUVENILE SALMON -- IN ADDITION THE LOCATION OF THE INTAKES THERE'S A PROBLEM IF WE'RE FOR DESIGNING. WATER MANAGEMENT SOLUTION. TO BE RESILIENT TO SEA LEVEL RISE THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES OR SWORD IS SEISMICALLY -- RIZ ROBUST. WE DON'T HAVE THAT. PROJECT AS IT'S CURRENTLY OUTLINED WITH THE W. R. -- THE INTAKES MAYBE TOO FAR DOWNSTREAM TO WITHSTAND LONG TERM SEA LEVEL RISE -- THE SEISMIC QUESTIONS OF THE OF THE ENGINEERING CONCEPT ARE ARE ARE. NOT ANSWERED WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE THE VOLUME OF WATER. THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED BY THIS MONTH THESE TUNNELS WOULD BE -- AND CERTAINLY IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- THOSE THOSE DESIGN CHALLENGES NEED TO TAKE FIRST AND FOREMOST. THE OTHER WATER ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- LIKE PROVIDING MORE NOTCHING AT THE A BY PASS -- MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE AS MUCH VOLUME AND THAT THE DELTA THE THE WEST COAST'S MOST IMPORTANT AND LARGEST ESTUARY -- MAXIMIZED SO -- A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE I BELIEVE THAT -- THE WE NEED TO GO BACK THAT THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE WATER BOARD NEED TO BE REVAMPED -- START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. NONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES IN ON THE PERMITTING -- DUMPING THE LEGAL SIDE FOR ME FOR A SECOND -- IN MY OPINION ARE ANSWERED SO -- A LOT MORE WORK. TO BE DONE. BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DISTRICT MENACE. I CHUCKLE BECAUSE WE HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS AND IT'S RARE -- G. GSA'S OFFICIAL VIEW IS THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD NEEDS TO COMPLETE ITS PHASE TWO OF THE DELTA WATER QUALITY UPDATE PLAN FIRST THAT WILL TELL US HOW MUCH WATER. IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR EXPORT THROUGH THE DELTA AND IT SEEMS THAT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO DESIGN A PROJECT TO WE KNOW HOW MUCH WATER WE ACTUALLY REALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO TO QUOTE STAFFORD LAYER OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME WATER MOVED FROM NORTHERN ALIFORNIA TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ACCEPT THAT AS AN ARTICLE OF FAITH. THE EXISTING SYSTEM. THAT. MOVES THIS WATER AROUND THE DELTA KILL SALMON RIGHT NOW. IT KILLS SALMON COULD WE DEVELOP A BETTER SYSTEM THAT COULD STILL MOVE SOME WATER AND BE BORE MORE BENIGN TO THE WILDLIFE. THEORETICALLY WE COULD -- HAVE WE SEEN IT YET NOT AS FAR AS WE KNOW AND THIS GOES TO NOTICE POINT ABOUT. A NEAT NEED TO TAKE A WHOLE NEW LOOK AT IT I WOULD ALSO COMMENT. ON THE LAST GO AROUND WITH THE TWIN TUNNELS. I THINK IT WAS G. C. ID WHO RESPONDED TO THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND THEY HAD SOME REALLY GOOD COMMENTS ABOUT -- THE INTAKE SCREENS NEAR FREEPORT IN SACRAMENTO HERE AND THEY POINTED OUT THE BASICALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN TAKES IN A RIVER YOU NEED TO PUT IT IN A CURVE IN THE BAND BECAUSE IT FORCES THE WATER SPEED UP. AND SKEW YOUR BABY SALMON PAST THE END YOU PUT THE INTAKES IN A STRAIGHT AWAY YOU'RE GONNA KILL MORE SALMON RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN STRAIGHT AWAY. SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CONSIDERATIONS BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST THE STATE WATER BOARD NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE. ITS PROJECT. TO REBALANCE WATER ALLOCATION SO THE DELTA IS NOT DYING. HE WAS RE MENACE RICKETS MISTER ANDERSON. IN THE END WE WE I WAS GONNA BE A MINUTE AT THE FLOWS. MANAGEMENT OF THE PHONE MORE THAN. OUR WEATHER'S ONE OR TWO BECAUSE ONE CAN BE JUST AS BAD AS TO BUT I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A BALANCE THERE THAT WE CAN ALL WORK WITH. BUT LIKE HE SAYS WHERE'S POSITIONS HOW IT IS AND IT'S JUST LIKE THE PUMPS AREN'T BAD. EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE PUMPING MORE BABY FIRST ROOM THEN THERE WAS WATER PRACTICALLY YOU KOW. THERE'S THE MANAGEMENT OF IT IS IF WE CAN HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THERE IS OVERSIGHT. THAT CAN IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE DESIGN. THAT WOULD KEEP THE FISH FROM THE IT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A DIVERSION LIKE THAT. WILL CHANGE THE WHOLE MIGRATORY FLOWS. FOR THE SYSTEM BE DIVERTED SOMEPLACE [inaudible] WERE RESTRICTED. WITH THE HATCHERY FISH ON ON STRAYING IN WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE MAJOR STRAYING INDUSTRY AND THE FIRST RETURNING. TO THEIR STREAMS THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE. WE DON'T WANT TO SHARE THE WATER IS THIS HOPEFULLY THAT WE CAN ALL WORK WITH IT. NOTHING SUBMISSIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION. I'M WORKING WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT. BELIEVE THAT OUR GOAL IS. TO PETITIONER'S SHOULDN'T RESTORE THE FISHERY FISHERIES AND AVENUE AND RIVER FISHERIES AND STAY OUT OF THE WATER WARS. AND SO WE TRY TO WORK ON WHAT WE COULD DO TO INFLUENCE THAT AND LIKE I SAY ARE. MOST COMMON GOAL NOW IS TO GET BACK TO THE FOUR MILLION ENHANCEMENT FISH SO WE CAN PUT HIM IN THE OCEAN [inaudible] IT CONCERNS. DISSEMINATED SHOW OF QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. TWENTY SAY THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR THE GENERAL NOW GONNA BE MOVING ON TO THE STATE OF THE STATE OF THE COMPANY CRAB SEASON AND WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING AN UPDATE FROM THE WHALE ENTANGLEMENT WORKING GROUP. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE FOR FANTASTIC PRESENTERS -- ON OUR PANEL HERE TODAY. FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE LORI FRIEND SHE'S A PRESENT AT CENTRAL COAST WOMEN FOR FISHERIES. WE'RE GONNA WELCOME DEAR GOD TO THE PANEL HE'S A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN OUT OF THE DAY GOODBYE. KELLY SPACES HERE SHE'S IN MINISTRY OF THE CABINET AND SCRAP FISHING YOU'RE WORKING GROUP. OF COURSE THANK YOU MASTER IT'S A PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE MARINE REGION OF THE COFFIN DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE WE WELCOME EACH OF THE FOUR HI HERE. TO THE FORUM TICKETS OFF THEY WERE GONNA CHANGE OVER TO DICK THEY WERE GONNA GO TO KELLY THEY'RE GONNA GO TO SAKE. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS FRENCH FOR ALL OVER WORK LAST NIGHT. AS USUAL SHE WAS WORKING AT AND CUSSING THE KITCHEN THE ENTIRE TIME -- AND JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE FOR YOUR ORGANIZING -- AND IT MEANS A LOT THAT YOU WERE HERE EVERY YEAR -- IN MY RIGHT -- I WAS CUSSING IN THE KITCHEN OKAY. HEY THERE YOU GO WITH HIS FRIEND SHE WE IT YOU ARE JUST A JAM AS I WAS TELLING YOU LAST NIGHT -- AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. ESPECIALLY DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE'VE BEEN COMING THROUGH IT HAS BEEN VERY PERSONAL FOR HER AND HER FAMILY AND YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO FOR OVER TO YOU. SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR NICE COMPLIMENTS AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE CANDY IN THE BOX IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THIS YEAR HEY I KNOW SOUR PATCH KIDS. NOW NOW IS IT IS WE HAVE NO CHOCOLATE AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS MORNING. BUT I DOUBT THEY WERE SLUMMING IT WITH THIS OUR PACKAGE. I APOLOGIZE -- THAT BEING SAID. IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS I'VE HAD TO RE WRITE MY TESTIMONY. MY ORIGINAL TOPIC WAS THE CURRENT -- CRAB SEASON IN THE STATUS OF OUR DISASTER MONEY -- NET KIND AND GOT TOSSED OUT THE WINDOW. YESTERDAY YEAH FOUR YEARS OF WORK BY THE CRABBERS ON THE WELL INTEGUMENT ENTANGLEMENT -- WORKING GROUP WERE PUT ASIDE AND SEVERE RAMP IMPACTS ARE COMING TO US. WORK THAT WAS ON PAID AN EXHAUSTIVE. THIS WAS TIME THAT WAS SPENT AWAY FROM. BOATS AND FAMILIES. TIME THAT WAS SPENT IN GOOD FAITH. FOR US ONLY TO BE CUT OFF ATTORNEYS. WE'VE COME TO A TIME WHEN NGOS. ARE MAKING THE POLICIES OF THE STATE BY BULLYING AND LAWSUITS. THIS THIS IS THE TRUTH AS I SEE IT. THESE CRISIS IS ARE BEING FABRICATED AND SOLVED. BY THESE BIG. ENVIRONMENTAL. BIG BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTALISTS. DOWN THE LIVELIHOODS OF FAMILIES. ARE BEING DESTROYED WHILE THESE NGOS MOVE ON TO THEIR NECKS FABRICATED CRISIS. IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE REGULATIONS WHY YOU'RE RECEIVING YOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PAYCHECK. NEVER MIND THAT YOU'RE TAKING FOOD OUT OF FISHING FAMILIES MOUTHS. I AM. TRULY TRULY DISGUSTED COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN ARE BEING ASKED TO CUT OFF EITHER THEIR RIGHT HAND OR THE LEFT HAND AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM [inaudible] CLOSURES. WILL BANKRUPT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER FISHERMEN WHO HAVE NO WHETHER FISHERIES TO BACK THEM UP. LOSING PARTS OF OUR SEASON WILL HURT NEEDLESSLY AND CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT FISHERMEN HAVE BENT OVER. BACKWARDS FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS DID YOU EVER AVOID WHALEN TANGLING. THIS AGAIN IS JUST ON ACCEPTABLE. WE'VE DONE IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN GOOD FAITH. THE FACT IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE HAVE BEEN NO ENTANGLEMENTS IN THREE STATES. ZERO THE FACT IS SHIP STRIKES DO MORE DAMAGE. TO THE WELL POPULATIONS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT THAT WHY SHOULD THEY WIN THE FISHMAN CAN BE MADE OUT TO BE THE BAD GUYS LET'S JUST REMOVE THE FISHERMEN QUESTION. FOR EVERYBODY IS WHY IS THE COMMERCIAL FLEET TAKING THE BRUNT OF THIS. PROPOSED CLOSURE WHILE RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE FISHING DO WELLS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WRECK LINE AND A COMMERCIAL LINE. FACT THE WELL POPULATION IS-GROWING BY 8% A YEAR. I ASKED YOU WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE. ANOTHER FACT. THE CRAB FISHERY USED. IN THIS STATE IS ONE OF THE STATE'S OLDEST COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IT'S BEEN HELD TO HIGH STANDARDS AND REMAINED STRONG. DUE TO MANY INDUSTRY INNOVATIONS OVER THE YEARS SUCH AS X. SCAPE RINGS AND COTTONS WE PUT THESE DAYS THESE THINGS IN NOT THE STATE WE DID IT FOR OURSELVES TO KEEP OUR FISHERY [inaudible] SOLID. THIS CONTINUES TODAY WITH THE INNOVATIONS THAT FISHMAN SUCH AS DECALOGUE HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY ON FACT. WE NEED THE CROSS TO OTHER CRAP TASK FORCE RE UPPED NOW NOT IN THE FALL. WE COULD SEE ADDED PRESSURE ON THE SALMON SEASON OVER THE YEARS THE MANAGEMENT STYLE. HAS GOING TO CLOSING FISHERIES RIGHT LEFT AND FORCING IS INTO THE SAME POT ALL. GUNS ANY LATERAL FISHING THAT'S NOT MANAGEMENT. BEING FORCED TO BRING YOUR CRAB GEAR IN EARLY THIS YEAR. PROPOSED. BRING IT IN. WILL ADD AN EXTRA DANGER THIS YEAR -- COMMERCIAL CRABBERS PLAN OUR STOCK OUT. IN A MANAGED. MANAGE WAY OVER PERIODS OF TIME SPRINGTIME CONDITIONS SUCH AS AND TESTIFY INTENSIFIED NORTHWEST WINDS AND OCEAN CURRENT WILL PLAY HELP GEAR FOR THE RETRIEVAL FOR SMALLER BOATS. AND I'M REALLY REALLY CONCERNED BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNGER FISHERMEN THEY HAVE SMALLER BOATS [inaudible] AND IF ONE OF THEM DIES IT IS ON THE STATE'S HEAD. THE DEPARTMENT IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO TAKE SAFETY INTO ACCOUNT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FAMILIES BE SMART. ARM AS FOR THE CRAB SEASON THIS YEAR. IT'S BEEN PRETTY SLOW BUT WE WERE MAKING A LIVING AND AS FOR THE ROWD DISASTER MONEY ADAM IS BECOMING INDUSTRY JOKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA COME BACK -- TO FOR SOME QUESTIONS HERE IN JUST A BIT BUT WE'LL GET THROUGH OUR PANEL THAT WORKS -- FOR EACH ONE OF THE FOUR WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MR AUG -- COMING INTO US FROM THE DATABASE THANK YOU AGAIN SIR FOR YOUR WORK WE WELCOME YOU TO FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF COMMENT ON SOME OF OUR GEAR INVASION OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW -- AND SOY I CAN YOU KNOW FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THE THE ROPE WAS SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO US -- RECENTLY -- ARE JUST REALLY PRACTICAL FOR THE FISHERY OF THEIRS THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO JUST WON'T FUNCTION WITH THE WAY WE WORK OUR GEAR. PHIL WHAT I'VE SEEN HAPPEN IS THAT THE GEAR INNOVATORS HAVE TURNED OF MEN TO ITEMS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY. TO TO FISH AND REDUCE THE IMPACT IT. THEY'RE THEY'RE REDUCING THE IMPACT ON THE ENTANGLED ANIMALS. SO THE IDEA IS TO REMOVE THE WEIGHT OF THE CRAB TRAP. QUICKLY. AND KEEP THE LINES FROM HITCHING ON THE THE THE ANIMAL ITSELF. THE DEVICE IS A SEPARATE THE LINES IN THERE BASICALLY COLD LINE CODERS -- THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT CAN BE OF SET OF RETENTION DEPP'S SPEEDS AND A TIME TIME SPECIFICALLY IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE LONGER. NEAR ME IF IT TAKES JUST A FEW SECONDS TO BRING UP THE GEAR. IF THE PART IS PULLED FOR A LONG DRUG FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME LINE COULD POTENTIALLY CUT THE CUT THE ROPE. AND ALLOW THE POT TO FALL OFF AND MINIMIZE THE THE IMPACT TO THE ANIMAL. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN PUT THIS -- TRY THESE LINE CODERS IN THE FIRST TEN FATHOMS OF THE OF THE GEARED TO BE ABLE TO GROUP THAT'S LEFT. AND POSSIBLY ALLOW THE ANIMAL TO FREE FREE ITSELF AND POTENTIALLY. YOU KNOW INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DISENTANGLE THE ANIMAL QUICKER. OR EASIER EASIER THE OTHER THING WE'RE WORKING ON IS -- GPS BOOTIES -- AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE TESTING THOSE AGAIN HERE VERY SHORTLY -- I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LOST POTS AND HELP US TRACK THE ANIMALS IF THEY DO GET ENTANGLED YOU'RE GONNA. BUT THE LINE CUTTER CENTIMETER UP THIS WILL TAKE YOUR TIME SO JUST EXPLAIN HOW THE BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE -- TO SEE. THE WAILING TANGLES EXACTLY AS I JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT REAL QUICK OKAY -- YOU KNOW MY MY MY THOUGHT WAS THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN'T REALLY LOSE THE GEAR WE DON'T WANT TO BE YOU KNOW HAVING THE LINE CUT. IN SAY YOU KNOW ALL I WORKED YOU KNOW SO IDEALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS BE ABLE TO PUT IT ONLINE. AND POTENTIALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND A TRUCK OR SOMETHING TO SEE HOW LONG YOU KNOW GIVE GIVE IT TIME. TO PULL ON THE LINE AND POTENTIALLY COATED IN RELEASE YOU KNOW A OB CHIC. ON LAND SO WE KNOW KIND OF WHAT. AMONG THE TIME DAY INTO QUESTION YEAH A OKAY OKAY OKAY AS IS. YEAH I KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S KIND OF A HOW HOW THEY WORK BUT THERE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THEY I FEEL LIKE IF WE CAN IF WE CAN GET THE LINE OFF THE ANIMAL QUICKLY OR GET THE WEIGHT OFF THOUGH AND THE LINE QUICKLY. THAT THE DAMAGE IS LESS NO I I I REALLY HOPE THAT THAT'S STILL THE WAY IT'S GOING TO WORK ON IN THE SHOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE WE WE'VE WE'VE ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LINE PROFILE TESTING WITH SENSORS ON THE LINE SO THAT WE CAN KND OF GET AN IDEA. HOW THESE LINES? LATE IN THE WATER UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS SEE CONDITIONS -- TYPICALLY THAT ENDS UP BEING A TWO DIMENSIONAL. OF GRAFT YOU CAN SEE OPEN DOWN BUT YOU CAN'T SEE FORWARD AND BACKWARDS AND YOU ALSO CAN'T SEE IF IT MAKES A LOOP. SO I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK -- OR AM GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE BIG MARINE LAB WITH UTILIZING OUR VIS. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE -- DIFFERENT LINE PROFILES VISUALLY AND SEE IF WE CAN SEE. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. WITH A LONG LINE MAKES LOOPS WITH THE ROUTE LADIES STRAIGHT OVER THERE IT IS OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW FOR ENTANGLEMENTS TO OCCUR. MORE READILY. SO. THESE ALL ARE GOING TO BE BE TESTING THESE THINGS VERY SHORTLY I SAY WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND THE ONE THING I WANT TO SAY IS YOU KNOW -- HONESTLY DON'T GIVE UP ON US WE'RE TRYING. WE'RE TRYING EVERYTHING WE CAN AND YOU KNOW I'M WILLING TO TEST ANYTHING WE CAN TO TO TRYING. TO TO REDUCE THE IMPACT SO THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I NEVER WILL GIVE A PROMISE YOU THAT -- INDISCREET FOR YOU HERE THIS TURNED OVER TO THE STATES WE WELCOME YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN CONGRATULATIONS MY GOODNESS ON THE HONOR AND IT HAS BEEN OUT OF THE WHOLE GROUP -- IN JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE -- THROUGH WORKING THROUGH THIS IN SOME REALLY CHALLENGING TIMES FOR RESOURCE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES THANKS FOR JOINING US AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME AND MY FELLOW. COLLEAGUES HERE MY NAME IS KELLY SEES ONLINE THE PRINCIPAL AND COFOUNDER OF STRATEGIC GROWTH CONSULTING AND TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUE FOR SHELL FISHER I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING. AS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND FACILITATOR THE COMMITTEE SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TO BE ABLE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE WORKING GROUP'S RECENT AT BIRTH RECENT EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES -- AS YOU ARE LIKELY AWARE THE WORKING GROUP IS CHARGED WITH ADVISING THE STATE ON STRATEGIES AND SOLUTIONS THAT HELP SUPPORT THRIVING WE'LL POPULATIONS WHILE ALSO A THRIVING AND PROFITABLE DUNGEONS CRAB FISHERY. AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL THE WORKING GROUP CONTINUES TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON ALL ASPECTS OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE WILL ENTANGLEMENTS FROM GEAR INNOVATIONS LIKE DICK WAS JUST SPEAKING TO TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM OR RAMP. THE RAMP WHICH WAS PILOTED DURING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISHING SEASON AND BECAME FULLY OPERATIONAL AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN UTILIZES INFORMATION ON FOUR FACTORS. TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS ELEVATED LEVELS OF ENTANGLEMENT RISK AND DETERMINE THE NEED FOR VOLUNTARY OR MANDATORY MEASUREMENT MEASURE MANAGEMENT MEASURES TO REDUCE RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT. THOSE FOUR FACTORS INCLUDE AT THE RATE OF ENTANGLEMENTS THE CONCENTRATION OF WALES THE FISHING DYNAMICS AND OCEANOGRAPHIC OR FORAGE INCLUDING PRECONDITIONS. WHEN AY OF THESE FACTORS INDICATE AN ELEVATION IN ENTANGLEMENT RISK A GROUP OF EXPERTS INCLUDING AGENCIES FISHERMEN ARE NGOS SCIENTISTS RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS CONVENE AND EVALUATION TEAM? TO REVIEW AND REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO HELP ASSESS THE SITUATION AND INVESTIGATE HOW ONE FACTOR MAY BE INFORMED OR INFLUENCING OTHERS TO FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEASON DELAYS. SEASONAL WILL MIGRATION PATTERNS AND PRE DISTRIBUTION AND HOW THOSE INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND AS NEEDED TO DEVELOP MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR SMALL PLACE CONSIDERATION. RAPPER LIES ON A VARIETY OF DTA INPUTS AND RESEARCH TOOLS INCLUDING AERIAL SURVEYS LANDINGS DATA WILL WATCH DATA OCEANOGRAPHIC SURVEY INFORMATION ENTANGLEMENT REPORTS AND ON THE WATER OBSERVATIONS. BY FISHERMEN. PER THE WORKING GROUPS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY THEY HAVE REQUESTED I SUPPORT TO IMPROVE AVAILABLE RAMP DATA STREAMS AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCILS TAKEN STEPS TO BEGIN BEING RESPONSIVE TO THESE REQUESTS. AN ACTIVE FISHERMAN'S TAX THREAD HAS BEEN PROVIDING A DIRECT CHANNEL TO DEPARTMENT MANAGERS TO SHARE REAL TIME INFORMATION ON WHAT FISHERMEN ARE SEEING ON THE WATER. I IN RESPECT TO BOTH CURE CONCENTRATIONS WHEELED DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS PREY AND FORAGE -- CONDITIONS THIS IS ALSO FOR THE FACILITATION TEAM AND THE AGENCIES UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE RISK IS BEING AS A CONCERN OF ENTANGLEMENTS WE CHECK IN WITH THE FISHERMEN TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE OBSERVING ON THE WATER. THE EVALUATION TEAM PROCESS STEP TWO OUTCOMES ARE SURE BROADLY VIA THE WORKING GROUPS EMAIL LIST THAT UNDESCRIBED TASK FORCE EMAIL LIST AND POSTED ON BOTH THE WORKING GROUPS WEBPAGE VIA THE PC'S WEBSITE. AND ALSO OTHER CHANNELS. AS THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE AND CERTAINLY HELP TO MAKE POSSIBLE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE I GAVE THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT THE ABILITY TO RESPOND IN CASES OF INCREASED ENTANGLEMENTS RISK. AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED EARLIER THE DEPARTMENT IS DEVELOPING A REGULATORY PACKAGE TO FORMALIZE THE RAMP IN CONSULTATION WITH THE WORKING GROUP AND HAS A STATUTORY DEADLINE TO DO SO BY NOVEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY THE WORKING GROUP MOST RECENTLY MET IN ON MARCH NINETEENTH WHICH BELIEVE OR NOT THAT WAS TUESDAY -- I PER THE AGENCY'S REQUEST AND THIS CONVENING OF THE EVALUATION TEAM WAS AS A RESULT OF SOME REPORTS THAT WERE COMING IN THAT WAY -- CONCENTRATIONS WERE STARTING TO INCREASE WHEN THIS TRANSITION TIME WERE PARTICULARLY HUMPBACKS AND BLUES ARE STARTING TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO THEIR MOST HUMPBACKS ADD TO THEIR TRADITIONAL FEEDING GROUNDS. AND SO THE AGENCIES MOBILIZED TO AERIAL SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED ON MARCH FIFTEENTH AND MARCH SIXTEENTH. THE EVALUATION TEAM CAME TOGETHER -- ON MARCH NINETEENTH AND ULTIMATELY ARRIVED AT THAT THE WHEELS HAVE NOT FULLY ARRIVED THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO COME ONLINE. THAT CURRENTLY LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A GOOD KRILL IN ANCHOVY YOUR HEAD -- IN THAT THEY'RE ALSO SEEMS TO BE SOME SHIFTING THAT'S HAPPENING RELATED TO EL NINO CONDITIONS LOOKING AT A MILD EL NINO - ON THE NEW YORK IN THE SUMMER. AND SO THIS INFORMATION -- WAS COMPILED A RECOMMENDATION WILL BE GOING TO THE DIRECTOR EARLY NEXT WEEK AND AS PART OF THAT RECOMMENDATION AN ADVISORY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE FLEET REGARDING THESE FACTORS AND LOOKING AHEAD -- INTO THE SPRING OR THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS TO BE MORE HONEST OR MORE ACCURATE -- AND THAT A MEETING WILL BE HELD AS THE SET AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED ARE JUST IN HIS IN HIS TESTIMONY MEETING WILL BE HELD NEXT WEEK. WHERE THE EVALUATION TEAM THE WORKING GROUP WILL COME BACK TOGETHER CONTINUE TO ASSESS THESE RISK ASSESSMENT FACTORS AND POTENTIALLY COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL? RECOMMENDATIONS AND POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES. THE WORKING GROUP CONTINUES TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE TO THE WORK AND EXCUSE ME THE WORKING GROUP CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE. NASH MEAN FISHERY SERVICE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND THE DENTURES CRIME TASK FORCE TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE SWELLING HANG WITH RISK AND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE STATE'S NEEDS. PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANY MORE INFORMATION AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY THANKS CHUCK THINK SO MUCH CAN BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK I HAVE A FOLLOW UP IN WHAT WAY. TO GET THROUGH THE REMAINDER THE PAIN ONLY WELCOME SEMESTER TO THE COMMITTEE HE'S A PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE MARINE REGION CUFF AND PART AND FISH AND WILDLIFE WE WELCOME YOU SIR YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SO GIVE ME ONE MINUTE PROMPT FOR RESOURCE. THANK YOU -- CENTER MCGUIRE COMMITTEE CHAIR. MY NAME'S SAKE MASTERMAN THE INVERTEBRATE PROGRAM MANAGER. I WAS ASKED TO KIND OF DO A RECAP ON THE CRAB SEASON AND THE WORKING GOUP MUCH OF IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID TO MY PRESENTATION WILL BE THANKFULLY SHORT -- AS YOU'VE HEARD -- THE CRAB SEASON THIS YEAR WAS DELAYED BOTH DUE TO DEMO CAN QUALITY ISSUES -- WE WERE A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE EXTENT OF THING POOR QUALITY CRAB TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE TALKING OF PROCESSORS. ASKING US TO DELAY THE SEASON EVEN BEYOND THE STATUTORY GUIDELINES CURRENTLY SO THAT WAS AN INTERESTING PROBLEM ALL THE WAY UP IN OREGON. DISTRICT TEN IN SOUTH SEEM TO HAVE A SIMILAR YEAR IN TERMS OF YIELD -- AS PREVIOUS HERE. THE NORTHERN DISTRICTS APPEAR TO BE COMING AND QUITE A BIT LESS THAN LAST YEARS WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT IN CRAB ABUNDANCE -- IN THE NORTH PARTICULARLY -- OF SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT IS DURING THE DEMO EVENT WE DISCOVERED AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE TRISTATE MEMBER. HEALTH AGENCIES INTERPRETATION OF FDA GUIDELINES WHICH CREATED QUITE A KERR FALAFEL -- AND WE ARE WORKING TO RESOLVE THAT THIS SPRING AT TRI STATE MEETING DEVOTED SOLELY TO RESOLVING THIS DISPUTE AND WHAT THAT WAS. IS THE F. TAG FDA GUIDELINES HAS AN INCONSISTENCY IN ITS WORDING. OREGON AND WASHINGTON INTERPRETED THAT IF A CRAB COMES IN AT THIRTY PARTS PER MILLION IT IS ADULTERATED AND NOT FIT FOR CONSUMPTION I EAT CAN'T PUT ON THE MARKET. CALIFORNIA HEALTH HIS THIRTIES OKAY. AND SO IT WAS NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE NEVER. NOTICED THIS DIFFERENCE. INTERESTINGLY THIS YEAR THREE OF OUR LAST TEST ON OUR NORTHERN COAST. THE AMOUNT MEASURED WAS THIRTY EXACTLY. SO WE SAID GO. OREGON WASHINGTON SAID DON'T YOU DARE BRING THOSE CRAB INTO OUR STATE PERSON MARKETING OR PROCESSING BECAUSE ADULTERATED. IT WAS A MASS -- ARE CRAPPER BOYCOTTED -- IN THOSE STATES WASHINGTON FINALLY CAME AROUND. BUT WE ALL AGREED ALL THREE STATES AGREE THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOR THE MARKET NOT GOOD THE FISHERMEN SO. WE'RE PLANNING A MEETING IN MAY OR JUNE TO GET ALL THE HEALTHY TO AGENCIES OF THE THREE STATES. TO GET US ALL ON THE SAME PAGE -- AS FAR AS A WILL AND HANG A WORKING GROUP YOU ALREADY GOT A GREAT RECAP ON THE BASIC WORK BUT GOING FORWARD THIS GROUP IS GOT MORE WORK AND MORE IMPORTANT WORK TO DO -- PARTICULARLY YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE GEAR RETRIEVAL -- REGULATIONS THEY WOULD HELP US DESIGN THOSE THOSE ARE LIKE -- UNDER PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD NOW. OF COURSE THE RAMP HAS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO ON REFINING -- RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES BEYOND JUST ROPE WHISKEY OR BECAUSE PERSONALLY I SEE ROPER'S GEARS KIND OF A UNICORN RIGHT NOW -- AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER TOOLS LINES CUT AWAY THINGS OTHER PRACTICAL TOOLS SECOND HELP MINIMIZE OUR IMPACTS TO WEALTH -- AND THEN WE ALSO IN PARTICULAR AS YOU HEARD THAT DIRECTOR COMMITTED IS TO APPLY FOR AN INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. THE CORE WORK OF THAT TO ACQUIRE THAT IS A HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN WE ARE GOING TO DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE WORKING GROUP TO HELP US. DRAFT IN -- FILL OUT ALL THE RETRACTED REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE ACTUAL MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES. THAT ESSENTIALLY ARE THE RAMP RULE SO WE GOT A GOOD HEAD START. WE HAVE A CALL WITH THE FEDS FRIDAY PROTECTED MARINE SERVICES FOLKS TO KIND OF GET INTO THE DETAILS OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTING THE HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN. WE'RE GONNA BE DOING A LOT OF WORK BETWEEN NOW AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I CERTAINLY WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. THRESHER ANY ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE REMOVED VANCE I'M. TO TALK ABOUT -- THE REAL TIME. TEXTING AND FISHMAN BEING OUT HOW IS AT WORK THE PATIENT KNOW THAT THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT BUT IS THAT A TOOL THAT IS THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND CERTAINLY WILL WELCOME SIX THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL SO MAYBE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT DETECTS GROUP AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS ARE THE FISHERMEN BOTH RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL WHO ARE ON THE WORKING GROUP. ON THE MANAGERS THE DEPARTMENT MANAGERS WHO ARE PART OF THE WORKING GROUP AND THEN THE FACILITATION TEAM -- AND SO WE TRY AND HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION BECAUSE THE WORKING GROUP -- FISHERMEN ARE FROM OUT OF STATE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO AVALON. AND WE HAVE ALSO. REACHED OUT TO VARIOUS AREAS WHEN THERE IS A FOCUSED A PLACE WHERE SOME WEATHER SINCE FOCUSED ATTENTION IS NEEDED. REACH OUT AND BRING OTHER FISHERMEN INTO THE CONVERSATION -- DETECTS GROUP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE SERRATION. THANK YOU TO TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE HAS ALLOWED THERE T BE THAT DIRECT LINE BETWEEN FISHERMEN AND MANAGERS WHICH IS I THINK A VERY POSITIVE THING. AND HAS ALLOWED TO FILL OUT THE WHEN -- WHEN LOOKING AT THE FISHING DYNAMICS FACTOR AS PART OF THE RAMP TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE FISHERMEN ARE IN SPACE AND TIME IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE READILY AVAILABLE AND QUANTITATIVELY GIVE SOME CHANGEABLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAS? SEEN IN DISCOVERED OUT IN THE WATER SO AN EXAMPLE THAT COMES UP IS WHEN AND THIS WAS LAST DECEMBER SO. DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THERE WAS OUT REPORTS THAT WERE COMING IN FROM FISHERMEN THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT CLEAR WATERS NO WHEELS WHAT'S A GOOD FISHING. A BIT YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE START OF THE SEASON LOTS OF LOTS OF GEAR OUT AND WE WERE GETTING INPUT IN FROM WHALE WATCHING OPERATIONS. THAT THERE WERE HUGE CONCENTRATIONS OF WALES. AND WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE A DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FISHERMEN TO ASK WHAT THEY WERE SEEING AND THERE WAS A DISCONNECT AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED ON THE WATER. THAT THEN LED TO THE ABILITY TO DO AN AERIAL SURVEY WHICH IS WEATHER DEPENDENT SO NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE BUT RELIABLE TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND THE AERIAL SURVEY WAS ABLE TO SHOW THAT THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF WHALES AND THERE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF FISHING HAPPENING BECAUSE IT WAS DECEMBER. BUT THERE WASN'T VERY LITTLE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT WAS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT DIRECT LINE OF CONVERSATION WITH THE FISHERMEN TO LET US KNOW THAT IF WE HAD JUST RECEIVED THE INFORMATION FROM THE WHALE OPERATORS WHICH AGAIN WERE OBSERVING WHAT THEY WERE OBSERVING ON THE WATER. THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE OF I NEED TO HAVE TO ACT IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT MEASURES QUICKER -- THIS ALLOWED THERE TO BE MORE OF A BALANCED CONVERSATION AROUND IT AND THEN THE AERIAL SURVEY BEING THE OBJECTIVE DATA TO HELP INFORM. I'M SUCKING IN AND TAKE ANYTHING TO OTHER ARE I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT IN YOU TOUCHED ON IT REALLY HELPS US INTERPRET WHAT'S BEING SEEN BY VARIOUS -- DATA STREAMS INDIVIDUALS. SO TUESDAY NIGHT UNTIL TEN THIRTY AT NIGHT I WAS. TEXTING FISHERMEN ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE OF OUR AERIAL SURVEYS ON THE WATER. THE SIGN IN USUAL MY LARGE AMOUNT OF GEAR MORE THAN WE WERE EXPECTING AND WEIRD. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THE DATA WAS JUNK -- SOMETHING'S WRONG AND REALLY WHAT IT WAS MORE ABOUT IS YOU HAVE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE WE KNOW WHAT WE SAW BUT WHY WHAT IS THAT AND SO. IT REALLY HELPS US. WHO DON'T HAVE A PRESENCE ON THE WATER DO IT KIND OF HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING SEEN OUT THERE IT'S INCREDIBLY HELPFUL? THANK YOU. MY COMMENT ON THIS WOULD BE THAT IT'S REAL TIME DATA. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE SPREAD. ALL UP AND DOWN THE COAST. AND IT GIVES GIVES THE MANAGEMENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HEAR. WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE WATER ON A DAILY BASIS? MINUTE BY MINUTE AND AND I I REALLY FEEL LIKEIT'S A VERY VERY USEFUL TOOL. NO IT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO THIS COMING WEEK IN REGARDS TO COME IN BEGINNING NEVER -- ALL THREE STATES IN THE SAME PAGE. SO WALK US THROUGH WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT YOU HOPE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED HERE THIS WEEK YOU HAD SAID YOU CAN GET ON TUESDAY. TUESDAY'S A WELL WORKING GROUP MEETING ON SAYS HE DID YOU SAY THE THOUGH YOU'RE GONNA BEGIN AGAIN THIS WEEK WITH THE OTHER STATES I'M SORRY THAT'S MAY MAY OR JUNE MAY OR JUNE I PASAR. OKAY NO NO IT'S MY BAD SO WE JUST WALK US THROUGH A LINE -- AND BECAUSE YOU'RE NEEDING TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE CORRECT. AND OBVIOUSLY THE TIME LINE IS GOING TO BE BACKING IN TWO OF THE KICKOFF OF THE SEAS CORRECT SO OUR HOPE OUR EXPECTATION IS. WE HAVE ASKED THE FDA FOR CLARIFICATION BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED. THERE DOCUMENTS OUR GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS HAVE AN INCONSISTENCY IN THEM -- THE ALL THREE STATES ONE OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE FDA. WE'RE GONNA BE PULLING HIM IN THERE AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION ONCE WE HEAR QUOTE. THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION BY -- EACH STATE'S HEALTH AGENCY HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PROCESS AND HOW IT IMPLEMENTS FEDERAL FDA RULES. SO OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE EVERY STATE ONCE WE FIND OUT THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION. MAKING SURE HOW EACH STATE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY -- IMPLEMENT IN SOME CASES RULES SOME CASES POLICY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT SEASON WE HAVE A CONSISTENT. UNDERSTOOD STANDARD ON WHAT'S ADULTERATED OR NOT [inaudible] IN ADDITION. FOR YOUR INFORMATION. OREGON HAS A EVISCERATION PROCESS. WE ARE NOW GETTING WORD BECAUSE OF THIS THE MORE IT WASN'T A ONE SHOT PROBLEM IT SEEMS TO BE HERE TO STAY. THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT WITH THE HEALTH AGENCY HOW WE WOULD SET UP AN EVISCERATION OPTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TOO SO WE WILL BE CONSULTING WITH OREGON AND WASHINGTON. HOW THEY WENT THROUGH ND DID THERE? IN MY IGNORANCE THE TISSUES -- ONE OF THOSE TWO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IT COST THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT KICKSTARTED. WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT I'M NOT SURE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IT'S UNCLEAR YET WHETHER THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA APARTMENT A HEALTH. WHETHER IT'S A RULE MAKING OR IT'S A POLICY APPROACH OR IS IT THROUGH A BEST -- HAS A PLAN AT THE FACILITY WHERE WE THAT'S PART OF OUR EXPORT EXPLORATION GOING FORWARD. IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS. SO THE MARINE LAB IT'S GONNA BE WORKING WITH YOU -- PROTOTYPES. ACTUALLY THE MARINE LAB HAS AN R. O. V. E. IT'S GOING TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO LOOK AT THE LINES VISUAL. GOT IT THAT'S OKAY. AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE AND PROBABLY DO THAT ALL THE TESTING KIND OF ON A ONE SHOT. AND THEN UTILIZE EUROBEAT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE LINE PROFILES GOT A KIND OF THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. WHEN LAURIE TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT MAY FIRST?

EIGHT EVEN SEEN COMING IN AT YOUR OWN BUDGETS I AND IF WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT I DECREASE ABUNDANCE ON THE NORTH SIDE THIS YEAR. DECREASED FASHION THE SOUTH.

THIRTEEN OH NINE IS IT LOOMING LARGE IN OUR MINDS RIGHT NOW AS YOU HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL -- THE WELL ENTITLEMENT WORKING GROUPS. THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR OCAL POINT. IN A MAJOR ISSUE OF OF REALLY NATIONAL. IMPORTANCE -- AND IT'S A VISIONARY PROCESS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN IN IN IMPLEMENTING SECTION -- SIX AS WELL AS THE OTHER PROVISIONS WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE. TESTING THE TOOL AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THIS PROCESS TO MANAGE COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERIES -- TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE RISK OF WELL ENTITLEMENTS -- FOR THE FIRST TIME [inaudible] AND THOSE IMPACTS AS WE'VE HEARD ARE GOING TO BE SEVERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE. SIGNIFICANT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DONE COLLABORATIVELY. WE'RE GOING TO BE DONE WITH FISHERMEN AT THE TABLE. WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT. THOSE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WE HEARD EARLIER THAT THE BENEFITS THAT WE ACHIEVE IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WHEN. THE USER GROUPS ARE AT THE TABLE -- IT AND AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE MANAGERS WITH WITH LEGISLATURES LIKE YOURSELVES. TO DESIGN SOLUTIONS AND AND SO WE WE THANK YOU. FOR CHAMPIONING A PROCESS LIKE THIS. IN ORDER TO REALLY CREATE A VISIONARY PROCESS -- THAT THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP THE INDUSTRY AT THE TABLE AND NOT ON IT -- AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SPEAKING OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR WE HAVE A FEW EXCELLENT BILLS -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY TWO THE THE FISHERIES OMNIBUS BILL TWENTY NINETEEN I'LL TALK ABOUT A COUPLE PROVISIONS THERE IN -- THE AS YOU SPOKE TO EARLIER CENTER WHERE THE THE NEED TO AVOID THE LANDINGS TAX CRISIS. OF OF A COUPLE YEARS AGO IS CRITICAL WE NEED TO PEG LANDINGS TAXES LENNIX FEES. TO CPI OR SOME OTHER INDEX -- SO THAT WE CAN. ITERATIVELY AND COMFORTABLY AND PRODUCE -- STAND WITH THOSE FEES ARE GOING TO BE THAT WE DON'T GET INTO SOME SORT OF HUNG UP SITUATION -- PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM TO THE TUNE OF THOUSAND OR MORE PERCENT INCREASE IN TAXES -- IT IT IS DESTRUCTIVE AND DEVASTATING WE NEED TO AVOID THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THERE AND OF COURSE MAKING SURE THAT THE SEA CUCUMBER FISHERY -- CONTINUES TO BE A PART OF THE PORTFOLIO FOR FISHERMEN LARGE AND SMALL IN CALIFORNIA -- IS IS CRITICAL AND N. AS WE'VE HEARD WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING PERMITS AN ACCESS AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS THAT. WE'RE ALSO REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SENATE BILL. SIXTY NINE WHICH IS CALLED THE OCEAN RESILIENCY ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE SHELF IS GROWING INDUSTRY -- I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT A COUPLE KEY PROVISIONS IN THAT BILL -- THE BILL WOULD ENHANCE. THE STATE'S USE OF BEST PRACTICES FOR OFF SITE RELEASES OF HATCHERY FISH WHEN DROUGHT STRIKE WHEN WE KNOW THAT ONSITE RELEASES WILL BE HARMFUL. OR WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN BEST PRACTICES. FOR OCCUR ALREADY SCHEDULED OFF SITE RELEASES COULD BE USED THIS WILL CREATE A POLICY OF THE STATE. SO THAT WE WILL USE IT WE WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT YOU WON'T HAVE TO BEG. FOR INVESTMENT IN THOSE KINDS OF RELEASES THAT'S GOING TO PUT FISH ON THE BACK DECK -- IT'S GONNA BRING MORE FISH BACK TO THE RIVER WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON SOME KEY WATER QUALITY PROVISIONS THAT HAS TO DO WITH TIMBER HARVEST -- AS YOUR COLLEAGUE MISTER DALI ALREADY SPOKE -- TO THE CAL FIRE. IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT AGENCY FOR THE PURPOSES OF MANAGING OUR WATERWAYS. AND THEY HAVE ONE MAJOR - THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS TO TRANSMIT TIMBER HARVEST PLANS TO REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN BOARDS FOR REVIEW BUT THOSE REGIONAL BOARDS ARE ARE DEEPLY UNDERSTAFFED AS YOU KNOW -- AND OFTEN THOSE REVIEWS DON'T OCCUR. AND SOMETIMES TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO SENATE POLLUTION CAN MAKE IT THROUGH -- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT REVIEW TO OCCUR AND IT WOULD REQUIRE REGION BOARD TO RECOMMEND HOW A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN THAT WOULD. BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE CAN GET BACK INTO COMPLIANCE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE. TIMBER HARVEST -- THAT OCCURS IT'S PROFITABLE -- AND PROSPEROUS AND DOESN'T IMPACT ARE CRITICAL SANITARY WATERWAYS -- OF COURSE ALL OF THIS BRIEFLY ECHO THE SENTIMENT THAT A SENATE BILL ONE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SALMON FLEEING ORGANIZATION AND WE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE SUPPORT. AND JUST BRIEFLY WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT FISHERY DISASTER ASSISTANCE I WANT TO EXTEND A HEARTFELT THANK YOU TO SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND DIRECTOR BONHAM FOR PROMISING TO LEVERAGE THERESOURCES OF THE STATE. TO SHAKE THESE FUNDS OUT OF THE FEDERAL POSSIBLE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS THE TIME IS NOW WE ALL KNOW WHY IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS HAPPEN VERY SOON -- AND SO I'M CONFIDENT IN THE STATE -- AND AND THEIR EFFORTS TO TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER THESE FUNDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY FOR YOUR HERE. WHEN I MENTION THE FLOOR OVER TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN ALL -- ACCESS UPDATE ON AQUACULTURE -- THIS TURN IT OVER TO MR ROBERT HASS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I ADVISE THE CALIFORNIA AQUACULTURE ASSOCIATION. AFTER MY LONG ASSOCIATION WITH EVERYBODY THAT PRODUCES FISH. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND SEAFOOD INSTITUTE. CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND SEE FOR INSTANCE BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR IT'S LARGELY THE GROUP OF ON SHORE SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY -- THEY PROCESS. ROUND FISH INTO PRODUCT FORMS THAT ARE LITTLE MORE ADAPTABLE TO THE TO THE HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR IN OUR STATE. INTO THE CHEFS AND PRODUCT FORMS THAT THEY WANT AND FRANKLY DEMAND -- LET LET ME TALK ABOUT AQUACULTURE BECAUSE STARTS WITH A AND AND YOU MENTIONED IT FIRST -- I HAVE SOME A LITTLE HAND OUT HERE FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND OTHERS OF THE END OF A SORRY JUST THANK YOU. PUT TOGETHER SOME FACTS AND AND FIGURES -- WHAT IS AWFUL CULTURE WHAT IS AQUAPONICS WHAT IS AQUA FINA WHAT IS? IT THE FISH FARMERS THEY FARM FISH. THEY FARMED OYSTERS ONE DAY WE MAY FARM -- OCEAN -- FINFISH -- CALIFORNIA FISH FARMERS DO SOME OTHER THINGS SO THEY STOCK A STOCKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BASS BLUEGILL CATFISH AND ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE TROUT THAT STOCK. THAT LEADS TO LICENSE SALES AT LEAST A FUN FOR FAMILIES AND VETERANS AND AND PEOPLE WITH -- ACCESS -- RESTRICTIONS AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN. THEY ALSO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF FISH AND SHELLFISH INCLUDING ALGAE AN ABALONE. BASS BLUEGILL CARP CATFISH CAVIAR MUSSELS OYSTERS PERCH. SEE WE'D STURGEON TILAPIA TROUT AND MORE -- THEY ARE ACTIVE AQUACULTURE FISH FARMING IS ACTIVE IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE -- IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR FUTURE SEAFOOD DEMAND. I THINK OUR FISHERIES AND IN MANY CASES. OUR FULLY -- DEVELOPED. WE KNOW WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OUR TAKE A FISH HERE IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO OUR EXPERT. AND IN OUTSTANDING FISHERY MANAGEMENT -- BUT OVERALL ON OUR PLANET WE NEED TO PRODUCE MORE PROTEIN IT'S GONNA COME FROM AQUACULTURE. THE OTHER COUPLE OF FACTOIDS. IT HAS A LOW CONVERSION. RATE FOR RACING PROTEIN. AS OPPOSED TO OTHER PROTEINS THAT WE CAN RAISE LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THEY'RE IN WATER AND THERE'S NO GRAVITY. THE CONVERSION RATES ARE OUTSTANDING. IN ITS NON CONSUMPTIVE -- IT AS FAR AS FRESH WATER THAT IS THE WATER THAT LEAVES FISH FARMS IS OF THE SAME OR HIGHER QUALITY THAN WATER ENTERING THE FISH FARMS. ESPECIALLY WITH AGRICULTURAL NEIGHBORS ENJOYING THE WASTE WATER THAT WE SHARE WITH THEM. AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU FARM MARINE SPECIES THERE'S NO NEED FOR FRESH WATER. TO PRODUCE THE FOOD. AND THEN LASTLY. CALIFORNIA OCEANS RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT HATCHERY PROGRAM. HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. IT'S SOUTH OF POINT CONCEPTION. IT INCLUDES ONLY THE DEDICATED MARIE IT IS THE ONLY DEDICATED GREEN FINFISH. HATCHERY ON THE WEST COAST SO WE HAVE BEEN -- FARMING -- FINFISH IN CALIFORNIA FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS -- WITH -- EXCELLENT RECORD OF PRODUCTION SOME TWO MILLION FISH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. TO AUGMENT THE TAKE OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY AND THE AND THE RECREATIONAL FISHING INDUSTRY. LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT -- PROCESSORS ARE AN EQUAL PART. OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY WE EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE ON SHORE IN THE TO SUPPORT THE FISHERMEN. THEN THAN THE FISHERMEN THEMSELVES HAVE -- THE PRODUCT FORMS I TALKED ABOUT -- PUTTING OF FISH TO THE MARKET PLACE IN THE MARKET FOR A MINUTE SEPTA WILL TO THEM. AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN IN A FISH PROCESSING PLANT. WE HAVE THE MAN IN THE VICE CHAIRS DISTRICT IN IN YOUR DISTRICT. WE INVITE YOU TO COME TAKE A LOOK AND WALK AROUND AND SEE THE INVESTMENTS THAT'S BEEN MADE. IN ORDER TO PROCESS AND MARKET THE FISSION KEEP IT IN SAFE STANDARDS AND SEE THE INSPECTION STANDARDS. HAZARD ANALYSIS CRITICAL CONTROL POINT THE MILITARY AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HEALTH STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. WE WANT TO TELL YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO YOU. FOR YOUR AUTHORSHIP OF SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY NINE LAST YEAR ON LANDING RECEIPTS AND UP UNTIL THIS POINT. LANDING RECEIPTS FOR DO. EVERY TWO WEEKS BY SNAIL MAIL.

THEY SAID IT'S A DEBATE BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND OMB. AND WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANYTHING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. SINCE WERE MANY MONTHS BEHIND THE CRAB INDUSTRY -- THAT'S GONNA BE A WHILE BUT IT'LL BE WELCOME TO HAVE BECAUSE IN THE CASE OF THE STARTING INDUSTRY THEY'RE GONNA USE. MOST OF THE IT IS KIND OF BUZZARDS LUCK THAT WHEN THEY GO LOOKING FOR SARDINE POPULATION TO SET A QUOTA. THEY DON'T LOOK WHERE THE SARDINES ARE SO IF WE GIVE THEM. ANOTHER AIRPLANE OR TWO AND SOME OTHER VOTES THEY CAN THEY CAN FIND THAT. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IN ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THE WISE MANAGEMENT CITY CALIFORNIA I AGREE WITH IT. REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT -- COURSE SUSTAINABILITY IS IS INVOLVES ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY IS FOR THE FISHERMEN. AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THIS BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE ALL FORGET THAT. FISHERY RESOURCES ARE RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THEY COME BACK IF THEY'RE OVER FISH THEY COME BACK WITH THEIR STRESSED -- WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE OVER FISH WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE STRESSED.

HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY NOT BEEN MUCH OF A MARKET PAROLE. URCHIN -- WORKING ON WAYS TO TO DO THAT NOW A MY SONS ARE ALL INVOLVED IN THAT IN THERE. WORKING HARD AT IT -- TO GIVE GIVE THIS EXAM SO WHAT WHAT IT WHAT WOULD THAT POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE WELL. WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LEANING TOWARDS AS WERE READY CREATING THESE ARE TUNES PICKING UP THE LARGER ONES IN TRYING TO FEED THEM? AND SEE IF WE CAN BRING THEM INTO A MARKET VALUE. AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE GOT SOME REALLY GOOD IDEAS BUT THEY ALL NEED TO BE TESTED WITH US YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO SET UP FACILITIES. AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS FOR IF WE DO GET THESE THINGS UP AND RUNNING. IS WE'RE GONNA NEED HELP GETTING PERMITTED. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE WITH THEIR PART IN FISHING GAME OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND WITH YOU GUYS. AND SO AS WE WORK INTO THIS WE WILL NEED HELP. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THIS THE SCREENING BECAUSE IN TO READ WRITE. BOMB YEAH COUSIN. THERE THERE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THE TWO DIFFERENCE HERE THE SPECIES OF THE PURPOSE OF SMALLER TO MAJORITY LINES ON IT. ARE USUALLY IN THE SHOWER WATERS THE REDS ARE IN SHALLOW AND DEEP BOTH AND THEY GOT ALONG RESPONDS IN THEIR BIGGER -- JIM THEY'RE MORE REMARKABLE VALUE TO SO. IN AT MY LAST QUESTION I MEAN PLAY TWENTY QUESTIONS WITH YOU. THE BIGGEST HAVE YOU SEEN SIZE OF WHAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY HARVESTS AS A RED. I KNOW THEY DON'T GROW THAT BACK THERE -- THREE INCHES OR THE LARGEST ONE GENE OF MARBLE COMES ABOUT -- ONE AND THREE QUARTERS TO TWO INCHES WERE THEY'LL START BECOMING A MARKETABLE THNG BUT LIKE THE PROBLEM IS. 99% OF THEM ARE JUST LITTLE TEENY TEENY THINGS AND THEY'RE NOT GROWING YES YOU'RE JUST TOO MANY OF THEM. KELP IS STARTING TO COME BACK. BUT WHEN IT DOES THERE IS JUST ATTACKED BY ALL THESE LITTLE BITTY PURPLE SO THEY HAVE MOTHER FOOD. AND SO THEY'RE EATING IT BEFORE REALLY GETS A CHANCE TO TAKE OFF. AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING SOME KELP COMING BACK WHICH IS REALLY A LOT OF HOPE FOR US. BUT IT'S STILL. A BIG PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE REST AREA QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND TALK TO US ABOUT MARKET -- WHAT YOU'RE SEEING OUT THERE -- WITH. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE NEWS RIGHT WITH TOMORROW CASTED WOULD HAVE YEAH. WOULD YOU HEARING ABOUT MARKET ON AQUACULTURE [inaudible] ANY CHALLENGES [inaudible] MR. WE'LL SHOW FISHER ARE THE MARKET IS STRONG DEMAND IS STRONG -- IN FACT NONE OF US CAN CAN MEET THE DEMAND OF THE MARKET WELL I'M CURRENTLY [inaudible] THE THE OCEAN HAS BEEN KIND TO US TO KEEP UP. BUT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MUCH INTEREST IN IN INCREASING PRODUCTION. YEAH. WELL BUT THE MARKET'S GOOD. IT'S GREAT. FOR US. IN THE IN THE TERRESTRIAL FINFISH PRODUCTION. MUCH OF IT TO THAT WHICH HAS AGO FOR STOCKING OF RECREATIONAL LAKES AND STREAMS -- GOES FOR LIVE MARKETS -- SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ENJOY -- THE FRESHEST FISH AVAILBLE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN. TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. WHERE LIFE ISSUES OF THE PREMIUM? AND SO THEY'RE STILL GREAT DEMAND. FOR THE EVERYTHING THAT IS PRODUCED BY AQUACULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S FORTUNATE. HISTORY. IS IT ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM OUR PANEL. PLEASE NOW IF I MAY IS THANK YOU CENTER WHO ARE AT THE THE LEADERSHIP YOU SHOWN. IN. CLEARING A PATH FOR FISHERMEN THEIR REPRESENTATIVE. ORGANIZATIONS AND THE THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO MANAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE SEVEN STEP COMMITTEE DONE INSTRUMENT CRAP TASK FORCE THE THE GEAR IN TIME A WORKING GROUP. ALL OF THESE SHARE ONE COMMON THREAD WHICH IS THAT FISHERMEN ARE PART. OF DETERMINING SOLUTIONS AND WE WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT THOSE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES SO WILL WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU TO STRENGTHEN. WE AUTHORIZE WHEN APPROPRIATE -- AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF POWER -- WE'VE ALREADY SEE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THAT WE HAVE A A RECEPTIVE AND THOUGHTFUL AUDIENCE AND AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN HIS ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION -- AND HIS APPOINTEES -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE NOT GETTING GOOD WORKS NO I THINK HE'S EMOTIONAL AND AN ANALYSIS OF CRAB OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE. TO WHATEVER THAT IS GONNA BE IT WHENEVER THE RIGHT TIME IS WORKING TO CONVENE A MEETING I DEBATED TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS AS WE HEAD INTO THE SEASON SO THANK YOU SO MUCH PLEASE SIR MISTER CHAIR I I I THINK NO SET. WADE WILL CREATE A MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I COULD OF BUT I SHARES FEELINGS NOT THANK YOU SO MUCH. EIGHT TWENTY IS A ALSO THANK YOU -- TO AND DEALING WITH A LOT OF FIRES AND JUST VERY VERY GRATEFUL ACTIVISTS WAS SO IT'S A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH HIM ALONG WITH VICE CHAIR. WHO'S JUST BEEN SUCH A CHAMPION AS WELL AND SO HAPPY TO BE PARTNER WITH YOU AGAIN SIR AND TO ALL OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY HERE.-ON ANY MISTER BRIAN WANNA FOLLOW PATEA IS WELL TALK MORE ABOUT PROPORTION SO -- YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM US HERE NEXT WEEK SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK MISTER. THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. PLAYS GERMAN HERE WE GO. WE'RE NOW MOVING TOWARDS OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY AND WE'RE SO HAPPY THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN HANGING WITH US. DURING HIS FORTY SIXTH ANNUAL ZEKE GRADER FISHERIES FORM. WE'RE GOING TO BE WELCOMING EVER SHOW FISHER. HE'S WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM OF THE JUDGES CRAP TASK FORCE HE'S GOING TO PROVIDE AND UPDATE THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES CRAB TASK FORCE. AND WHAT THE HECK THEY'RE GONNA BE UP TO HERE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'RE GRATEFUL TO DARREN IS HERE HE'S THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA VISOR COMEDIAN SALMON AND STEELHEAD TROUT. HE'S GONNA BE UPDATING THE COMMITTEE ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE. I AS WELL AS THE GRAND LEGISLATION. IN HE'S GOING TO BRIEF THE COMEDIAN TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS IN NEED OF MORE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. AND THEN WERE GRATEFUL THAT LEASES HERE LIZ WHITE MEAN SHE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN SIGN STRESSED. BUT SHE'S NEW AND WE'RE EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH HER SO HOT DANG WATCH OUT. DONE AND SHE'S GONNA BE PRESENTING -- ON THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SHE'S GOING TO BE SHARING THEIR UPDATED STRATEGIC VISION AND SOME OF THOSE HIGHLIGHTS AS WELL. DELAYS IN GERMAN -- WITHOUT FURTHER DO THAT SHIRT OVER TO OUR PANEL WE'RE GONNA START WITH HER SHALL THEY WERE GONNA TURN OF A DARING RAN TURNOVER LACE. SHELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WELCOME YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF YOU WHEN IT PROMPTS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- AND YES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE THIS ANNUAL UPDATE ON BEHALF OF THE TASK FORCE -- THE TASK FORCE LAST NIGHT JUNE FIFTH AND SIX OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHERE THEY APPROVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. POST RAFT LOST FISHING GEAR RECOVERY PROGRAMS TITLE FOURTEEN REGULATIONS. FOR AT THE MOUTH FULL EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE AND THIRTEEN TEN AND THEY PROVIDED RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED. SERVICE GEAR SET UP REGULATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THE TWENTY SECOND. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TRI STATE DUNGENESS CRAB COMMITTEE MEETING. THEIR SUBCOMMITTEE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MET IN AUGUST AND DISCUSSED OTHER -- PRIORITY TOPIC THAT THE TASK FORCE'S INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING. X. ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO GEAR SERVICING REQUIREMENT. AND DIE IN OCTOBER MY SELF AND MY COLLEAGUE KELLY FACE THE FACILITATION TEAM ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM AND YES -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE. HIDE THE PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OF VISITING PORTS BETWEEN ADELINE CRESCENT CITY TO TALK TO COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND WHOEVER WOULD WANNA SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. AND WE LEARNED ABOUT INTEREST SPECIFIC TO THE TENSIONS CRAB INDUSTRY SHARED UPDATES ON THE TASK FORCE AND PRIORITY ISSUES INCLUDING WHALEN TELEMANN'S AND DEMOC ACID. AS YOU KNOW SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TEN REQUIRES AN UPDATE TO MAKE ABOUT THE TASK FORCE BASED ON SOME TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THAT URGENCY BILL LAST YEAR THE TASK FORCE OR SEES ME THE DEPARTMENT AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL BEGAN THE PROCESS OF TASK FORCE ELECTIONS. WHICH HAD NOT BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE SOME NEW ELECTIONS. AND SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TEN REQUIRE FASHION SO THE ELECTIONS THE AUCTIONS MATERIALS WENT OUT. YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE SO FOLKS SHOULD START GETTING MAILED BY FRIDAY WITH THE ELECTIONS MATERIALS ALL. DENTURES CRAB COMMERCIAL PRINT. COMMERCIAL DENCH'S CRAB PERMIT HOLDERS. AND ON THE ELECTIONS THIS YEAR WILL BE HELD IN THE PORT COMPLEXES A CRESCENT CITY TRINIDAD FORT BRAGG. SAN FRANCISCO AND THE PORT SOUTH OF HALF MOON BAY AND NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY BE ELECTIONS WILL BE FOR THE NON RESIDENT PERMIT HOLDERS YOUR RICA. BODEGA AND HAPPEN BAY. AND ON TOP OF THE LECTURE INS CURRENTLY AS AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY THE DEPARTMENT -- PC ARE WORKING THROUGH STATE BUDGETING AND CONTRACTING PROCESS IS TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR TASK FORCE ADMINISTRATION FACILITATION BEYOND APRIL FIRST WHICH IS WHEN STRATEGIC EARTH CONTRACT -- COMES TO AN END. THROUGH SB THIRTEEN TEN FUNDS FROM THE DENTURES CRAB ACCOUNT WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT THE TASK FORCE AS THEY ARE AVAILABLE. AND THE INTENTION IS TO CONFIRM TASK FORCE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THE TASK FORCE CAN RECONVENE AS SOON AS THE ELECTIONS ARE COMPLETED. THE MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE FISHERMEN AND OTHERS CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY TOPICS FOR THE TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THIS UPCOMING YEAR AND BEYOND SHORT AND LONG TERM. AND INCLUDES TOPICS RELATED TO REDUCING THE RISK OF WOMEN TANGLE MEANT IN THE DENTURES CRAB INDUSTRY THE EFFORTS OF THE DENTURES CRAWFISH AND YOU'RE WORKING GROUP WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP THERE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. I DEMO CASTED INVESTIGATION ORDERS AND SEASON OPENERS. ETCETERA AND SO THESE TOPICS ARE BEING TRACKED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM AND BY THE AGENCIES FOR CONSIDERATION AND DISCUSSION FOR FUTURE DENTURES CONTEST FOURTH MEETING AGENDAS. THE TASK FORCE IS GRATEFUL TO SENATOR REQUIRE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ESPECIALLY THROUGH SB THIRTEEN TEN AND THIRTEEN OH NINE IN THE TASK FORCE ALSO THANK THE DEPARTMENT -- PC FOR THE FISCAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. ON BEHALF THE TASK FORCE ME ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM I JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE AUDIENCE AND I THINK. HE'S STILL HERE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS RELATED TO TALK. MISS FISHER THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THROUGH THE YEAR THAT THE GLUE THAT MAKES IT ALL WORK SO AND KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD SO VERY VERY GRATEFUL. FOR ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS WERE HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH. IS NOW ART PLEASURE TO BE TURNED OVER TO MR MARROU HE'S THE CAT CHAIR OF THE COMPANY BUYS RE I'VE COMEDIAN SALMON STEELHEAD TROUT. WELCOME THANK YOU IT WAS GREAT TO SEE LAST NIGHT MY GOODNESS IN SOME GOOD GRAB I GOTTA TELL YA THAT WAS GREAT -- AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROMPT OKAY WELL THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE AND MEMBER STONE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TOM THINKS INVITING ME -- BEFORE I GET MY PREPARED NOTES I JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. FOR YOUR EFFORT LAST YEAR TO CREATE THE GREAT RED WOULD TRAIL IN THE EEL RIVER THIS IS A TREMENDOUS THING YOU KNOW THAT MY WORK IN THE REVERSE FOCUSED ON BRING BACK SEVEN IS STILL HAD BUT THAT TRAVELED VIA AN INCREDIBLE -- VALUABLE RESOURCE IN THAT WATERSHED FOR MAKING GREAT PROGRESS HE JUST -- THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY MILLION THAT WHICH IS FUNDED LAST THURSDAY VERY SEGMENTS IT'S GONNA ONE THOUGH YEAH I KNOCK ON WOOD. IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT PARTY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. RCA SEES BEEN VERY BUSY THIS YEAR WE HAD -- THREE MEETING QUARTERLY MEETINGS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING IN TWENTY NINETEEN YESTERDAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- AMONG THE MANY AGENDA TOPICS WE HAD -- WE FOCUSED ON STREAMLINING OF REGULATORY PERMITS TO HELP ENABLE BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE SALMON RECOVERY -- WE'VE FOCUSED ON THE CALIFORNIA BAR MIDDLE FLOWS FRAMEWORK UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY THE STATE WATER BOARD AND YOU SEE SCIENTISTS. AND YESTERDAY THE MENTION WE HAD A MEETING ON CENTRALLY HATCHERIES THAT WAS VERY ROBUST AND WELL ATTENDED BY -- MANY FISHERMEN AND OTHER AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES -- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR APPOINTING FOR MEMBERS TO OUR PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE AS WELL -- TO THOSE WERE NEW MEMBERS TO WERE -- REAPPOINTED IN ADDITION TO THOSE APPOINTMENTS WE ALSO -- SELECTED A NEW PAIR C. CHAIR MISTER -- MATT CLIFFORD FROM TRY TO LIMITED AND LAST YEAR WE ALSO WROTE A CHARTER. TO THE DEPARTMENT TO REDEFINE THE GOING FORWARD IN OUR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE OF THE FISHERY RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT -- WE WERE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT -- OUR SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION YESTERDAY BUT WE HAD TO TO ROBUST MEETING THAT WE DIDN'T GET TO IT SO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE CONSENSUS FROM THE CDC ON BILLS THAT WE SUPPORTS ALL I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THOSE THINGS. I DID WANT TO MENTION HOWEVER SP NINETEEN WOULD HAVE THE W. ARE IN THE WATER BOARD DEVELOPED THE PLANTED A PLACE STREAMFLOW GAUGES. THROUGHOUT THE WATERSHEDS AND THE NORTH COAST AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THIS WOULD HELP CLOSE THE GAP ON CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY SIDE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT. BUT AGAIN I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT IT'S A TREMENDOUS. MISLI IMPORTANT THING TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR STREAM FLOWS ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEMANDS FOR WATER -- I'M REALLY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN HE WE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH A GROUP OF RESTORATION SCIENTISTS. AND MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE GRANT PROGRAM STAFF -- OUR GOAL IS TO BRING FORTH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RESTORATION COMMUNITY TO THE GRANT PROGRAM STAFF ON WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAMS. WE CAME FOR THE SET OF EIGHTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE DELIVERED AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO DOCTOR BONHAM. AND THEY WERE VERY WELL RECEIVED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STAFF NOW IS WORKING TOWARD FORMULATING STRATEGIES FOR ADOPTING MANY IF NOT ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS -- THERE WAS ONE UNRESOLVED RECOMMENDATION WHICH WAS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO UTILIZE FEDERAL ACCOUNTING RULES. AN INDIRECT COST RECOVERY RATES -- THESE ARE KANIKA AGREEMENTS SO THAT OUR RESTORATION PRACTITIONERS CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR FOR THEIR INDIRECT COSTS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CONDUCT SOME OF THE RESTORATION PROJECTS -- WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHY THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY IS EXPRESSING THEIR INABILITY -- TO SUPPORT THE USE OF THOSE -- INDIRECT RATES IN THE IN THE GRANT PROGRAMS. I THINK THEY'RE WORKING ON IT BUT WE JUST WANT SOME SOME ASSISTANCE ON UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TO FUNDING RELATED PROBLEMS THAT ARE SALMON IS STILL A RECOVERY EFFORTS KIND OF REFERRING TO WHAT DOCTOR BONHAM REFERRED TO AS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING THAT ARE NEEDED -- FIRST AS YOU ARE AWARE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL AND STATE TAX MONIES ARE SPENT ANNUALLY. FOR HABITAT RESTORATION TO BRING BACK NATIVE SALMON AND STEEL HEAD. HOWEVER THESE PROGRAMS LACK A STABLE LONG TERM SOURCE OF FUNDING TO MONITOR ADULT AND JUVENILE FISH POPULATIONS. TO DETERMINE IF OUR ACTIONS ARE BEING EFFECTIVE. CITY OF W. AND THE NATIONAL MEAN FISHERY SERVICE HAVE A COASTAL MONITORING PROGRAM THE CMP. THIS IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM AND IT NEEDS FUNDING IT NEEDS AT LEAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE MONITOR TEN ESA FEDERAL YES A LISTED SPECIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THESE FUNDS ARE ESSENTIAL TO VALIDATE WHETHER OR NOT OUR CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTIVE IN REBUILDING THESE POPULATIONS -- OUR COMMITTEE THE CC IS COMMITTED TO WORKING TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THIS BASIC PROBLEM AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE FUNDING SOURCES THAT'LL BE SUSTAINABLE FOR THE LONG TERM. AND THE SECOND ITEM I LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS -- THE RECENT PLIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST SALMON. COLD WAR ON STATE AND FEDERALLY LISTEDAS ENDANGERED AND THESE POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. ARE CURRENTLY AT HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION. I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS WITH THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE. ALONG WITH STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL I STAFF ABOUT THE CURRENT PLIGHT -- AND THE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THE COAST SOUTH OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE ARE BEING SUSTAINED PRIMARILY BY THE KING FISHER FLAT. BROODSTOCK PROGRAM -- WHICH IS A JOINT FACILITY OPERATED BY THE MONTEREY BAY SALMON AND TROUT PROJECT NURTURING FISHERY SERVICE. AND SEE IF W. SO MEMBERS STONE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IN YOUR REGION AS WELL AND VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FOLKS DOWN THERE -- THIS FACILITY THIS KING FISHER FLAT FACILITY CURRENTLY LACKS DEDICATED FUNDING IN NEEDS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO SUSTAIN THEIR OPERATIONS -- THE EXISTING FUNNIES FINDING IT IS SET TO EXPIRE IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY IN ADDITION THE MONITORING PROGRAM IT'S FOCUSED ON SCOTT CREEK THAT KIND OF MONITORS THE SUCCESS OF THE THE BRIDGE DOT PROGRAM IS ALSO IN DANGER OF LOSING ITS FUNDING IT'LL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS. YEAR -- SORT WERE AT HIGH RISK OF LOSING THESE FISH. AND THE PROGRAMS DEDICATED TO THEIR PREFERRED TO PREVENTING THEIR EXTINCTION ARE SET TO EXPIRE IN THE NEXT YEAR. SO WE NEED TO ESTABLISH THIS BROODSTOCK PROGRAM IS A PRIORITY AND IT'S ESSENTIAL TO SAVE THE COLE ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST SO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. BROUGHT ALONG SOME -- INFORMATION FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT CAN LEAD TO GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT WE CREATE LIKE. THANK YOU SO MUCH WHAT THE SURGEON YOUR MIND IS PASSING OUT THE INFORMATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND WITHOUT A CLOSE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND I SHOP SIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS HOUSEHOLD TO WE'RE DONE HERE THAT WORKS OKAY. WITH YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH GREAT JOB WERE GRATEFUL THAT LIZ IS HERE SHE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WE WALK ME TO COMMITTEE IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPTED YOU SO MUCH FOR ATTENDING. THIRTY MCGUIRE CHAIR AND SET THEM. AND THE MEMBER STERN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS LIZ WHITE MEN I AM PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN SIGN STRESSED. A UNIQUE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BUT ESTABLISHED BY CALIFORNIA STATUTES AND WHICH ALSO SERVES AS SCIENCE ADVISER TO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. I'M WE ARE A TEAM OF TEN A SMALL POWERFUL TEAM OF TEN SCIENCE TO POLICY EXPERTS BASED JOINTLY IN SACRAMENTO IN OAKLAND. THAT BELIEVES THAT SCIENCE CAN ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE STATE'S GOALS OF A HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE OCEAN COAST. WE'RE REQUIRED BY OUR FOUNDING LEDGES THE FORMULATION RESOURCES TO CHIP ACT TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON OUR ACTIVITIES TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO TODAY I AM MY PURPOSE HERE IS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORTS IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THAT REQUIREMENT. AND WITH FORMAL -- TRANSMISSION TO TO FOLLOW TODAY ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE IT IN THE BACKGROUND RESOURCES -- I'D LIKE TO JUST VERY BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT TWO AREAS OF WORK FROM THAT -- SHARING WITH YOU HOW WORK THAT WAS LAUNCHED DURING THAT TIME PERIOD HAS HAD SUBSEQUENT IMPACT AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. THE FIRST IS THAT A BIG SORT OF HIGH LEVEL GENERAL -- LAST YEAR WOKING WITH THE EXPERT PANEL FROM THIS OPEN OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM WE PRODUCED THE FIRST EVER COAST IN OCEAN SYNTHESIS -- AS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SHIFT FROM. I WOULD SAY MERELY BUT IT IT -- COMMENCE -- PROJECTING CHANGE AND IMPACTS TO ALSO BEGINNING THAT DIALOGUE ON SOLUTIONS AND ADAPTATION OPTIONS. SO AS A SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM WE CAN NOW LOOK TO FIND WAYS TO LIFT AND LEVERAGE AND ENGAGE MORE BROADLY TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THOSE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION SOLUTIONS AND AND RECOMMENDATIONS. INCLUDING ADDRESSING QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT ROLE DOES ON NETWORK OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS PLAY HOW DO WE YOU SEE CROSSES AND HELP FORESTS. HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN THE OBSERVATION OF THE STATE AND THE WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT IS HOUSE NOT JUST IN ACADEMIA BUT ALSO IN IN FISHING AND FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES? THE DRILLING DOWN THAN THE SECOND PROJECT THAT I JUST QUICKLY WANTED TO TO HIGHLIGHTS. IS M. REFERENCED WITHIN THAT BROAD SYNTHESIS BUT IS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT MORE AT ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES AND FISHING COMMUNITIES. THIS WORK WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AGAIN WITH AN EXPERT PANEL FROM THE SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM. WHO DISTILLED WHAT YOU WHAT YOU ALL KNOW IS JUST AN AMAZING COMPLEXITY OF SCIENTIFIC? RESEARCH AND DATA INTO FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS -- FOR CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN ENVIRONMENT AND USE THAT AS A WAY TO LAUNCH A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEX OF PRAGMATIC MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AND CHANGES THAT COULD SUPPORT. ADAPTING FISHERIES IN FISHING COMMUNITIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. TODAY BUILDING ON THAT FOUNDATIONAL WORK AND WITH ADDITIONAL PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. WE'RE ABLE TO CONVENE A A BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS MANAGES -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO EXPLORE WHAT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS THE LEAVE AS THE MANAGEMENT LEAVE US AN OPTIONS ARE. THEY CAN HELP -- TO SORT OF BUFFET BUILDERS THIS GAIL AND HOW THOSE MIGHT LOOK MEANT AND TWEAK AND MODIFIED THE THE BROADER FISHERY MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS THAT A STATE WIDE SCALE. AND SO BECAUSE I'M LOST I'M GONNA MAKE THIS VERY BRIEF -- TURNING THEN -- TO OUR OCEAN SCIENCE TRYST -- STRATEGIC VISION RECENTLY UPDATED -- WITHOUT BOARD OF TRUSTEES THEM AND SUPPORT FROM UP HOTNESS. I WANTED TO JUST EXPRESS TO YOU THAT -- WE TAKE PRIDE IN AS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION NIMBLE RESPONSE TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCIENCE TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON POLICY. OUR UPDATED STRATEGIC VISION IS ORIENTED TO THE TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FOUNDING LEGISLATION -- WHICH CORSO WAS PASSED IN IN THE YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND AND HI HUMBLY BELIEVE AND I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT WHILE I'M NEW TO THIS ROLE I HAVE BEEN WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR TEN YEARS -- AND I FEEL VERY PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THROUGH TO THE THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OCEAN SCIENCE STRESSED. THAT TO AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BOLD EXPERIMENT LAID OUT IN THAT LEGISLATION OFTEN NONPROFIT PARTNER TO THE STATE IS WORKING AS A MODEL FOR EFFECTIVE SCIENCE INFORMED POLICY. WHAT I WOULD LOVE? TO DEEPEN AND STRENGTHEN INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE DO. AND THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THE STATE AGENCIES IS ALSO MORE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF YOUR PRIORITIES AND AND INTERESTS AND I WOULD WELCOME A VENUE FOR THAT CONVERSATION. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD JUST CLOSE IN SAYING NO WE BELIEVE IN PUTTING SCIENCE TO WORK -- TO CREATE SOLUTIONS TO CHALLENGING PROBLEMS. WE HAVE IN FOR YOU IN FRONT OF US AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND LOVE THAT YOU WERE STANDIN BY DATA IN SCIENCE AND WISH EVERYONE. AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT WHAT SO BUT WE WILL GET INTO THAT TODAY SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH IN NICE JOB. I WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER WITH DARREN FOR SO DEAR AND TALK WITH US ABOUT YOU KNOW WE WE HEARD.% EARLIER -- FROM THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY AND ARE THERE A FISHERMAN. BUT COLD WATER -- AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD YEAR CAN YOU GIVE US OUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND AS WELL. WELL THE FISHING'S BEEN TERRIBLE WHICH IS A GOOD THING FOR THE FISH. THE RIVERS HAVE BEEN SO HIGH -- THE WORK WE'RE HAVING REALLY GOOD WINTER FLOWS -- I THINK PERSONALLY THAT THE MOST CRITICAL PERIOD OF THE YEAR IS THE SPRING TIME WHEN THE SMELTER HEADING OUT TO SEA. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE COLD WEATHER PATTERNS THE RAINFALL THAT WE'RE HAVING -- IT OUGHT TO BEAR A GOOD. YOU KNOW THREE YEARS FROM NOW RETURN. TO THE RIVERS -- YEAH [inaudible] THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHOW. GIVE US A MINUTE DOES BUT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING -- FROM FISHERMEN -- IN CHALLENGES -- THAT Y'ALL COME THROUGH SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHAT DO YOU HEAR. THIS YEAR OR IS COMMITTED NOW RIGHT THANK WE WE'VE HEARD -- THAT IT STARTS TO ADD UP AND ON TOP OF IT WERE NOT SEEN IT IS BEEN A SLOW MOVING TRAIN. BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE DISASTER RELIEF COMING IN. ARE. ARE YOU SEEN FOLKS ARE COMING BACK -- WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK AND WOULD YOU HEARING FROM THOSE WHO YOU'RE WORKING WITH. I THE TASK FORCE IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH MAKING SURE THAT THE FISHERY OPERATES IN A FASHION THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS REALLY AND SO. I THINK THE TASK FORCE WAS ESTABLISHED I MEAN WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE DON'T HAVE TO MOW GAS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAYLAND TANGLE MINUTES. SO THESE ISSUES ARE VERY NEW TO THE A LOT OF ENERGY FOR THEM TO DISCUSS THEY ARE DISCUSSING IN THE SERRATION ORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND YEAH I THINK THEY'RE THE TASK FORCE'S MAIN GOAL IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY. AND SOME OF THAT IS LOOKING AT THESE BIG ISSUES AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE EXISTING REGULATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT. THAT DOES WORK FOR THE INDUSTRY. ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WE WERE ASKING -- STRICTER BOTTOM LINE IS  LACK OF RESOURCES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE ON THE TESTING SITE -- IN IN OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PICK IT QUICKLY I HAD TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST. ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE TASK FORCE IS ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT UP THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE FASTER PROCESSING OF THE SAMPLES FROM DENMARK ACID AND HAD. MADE REQUESTS TO THAT EFFECT IS IT BEN WITH THAT THE LABS OR IS IT NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES WHAT'S YOUR BUT I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T. IT'S NOT MY PLACE I DON'T WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE JUST KNOW WHAT THEY'VE TOLD US THAT. IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF SAMPLES COMING IN THIS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MUCH BIGGER THAN OREGON AND WASHINGTON SO WE HAVE. MUCH HIGHER VOLUME OF SAMPLES COMING INTO THEIR SO. I IMAGINE IT IS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THERE CAUSING A DELAY. IN AN ITEM THAT SAKE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH WERE VERY GRATEFUL FORMALLY HEARD IN APRIL OR MAY IBM TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THE WEST COAST HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S CAN IMPACT THE FISHERY. I THINK THAT WILL BE OF A POSITIVE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK TALK AND IT DOESN'T JUST STOP AT THE STATE LINE SO HAVING THAT THAT TRI STATE DISCUSSION I THINK IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE ENTIRE FLEET. THANK YOU WHICH OF PLEASE TURN YOUR CHAIRMAN AND I DON'T KNOW. LIZ -- TALK WITH US ABOUT OCEAN INSTEAD OF AND WE LOVE THE BEAUTY HERE ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS GOING FORWARD -- WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT WERE SEEN NOW IN WHAT YOU EXPECT HERE -- IN THE COMING YEARS TO COME -- OCEAN ACIDIFICATION SIR THEM IT. IN CRUDE TERMS THE REDUCING PH OF OCEAN WATERS BUT THEY ACTUALLY ISSUES A FORMAL COMPLICATED THOUGHTS AND REALLY -- INTERTWINED WITH THEM BROUGHT TO CHANGES IN OCEAN CHEMISTRY AND OCEAN TEMPERATURE -- I THINK WE ARE -- WE ARE POISED TO BE SORT OF HAVE FRONT LINE IMPACTS ON THE WEST COAST AS A RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE UP WELLING OF COLD NUTRIENT RICH WATERS. AND IT WAS IN RECOGNITION OF THAT SO THAT -- I THE STATE I THINK IS ON THE FRONT LINE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS -- OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WE CONVENED A SCIENCE PANEL THAT LOOKED AT THE ISSUE. AND PROVIDED A SATYR OF PRAGMATIC POLICY SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN. SUBSEQUENT TO ADAM TO THAT AS SUCH THE LET THE DEVELOPMENTS -- IN COLLABORATION WITH US AND MANY OTHERS OF AN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ACTION PLAN THAT REALLY LAYS OUT A ROAD MAP OF ACTIONS ALONG THE WEST COAST AND AND FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA. TO DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ISSUE IT IS AN ISSUE OF RAPIDLY EVOLVING ANTI PAINTING SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING BUT ALSO BEGINNING TO PRO ACTIVELY ACT -- AND PILOTS NEW APPROACHES THAT LOOK AT THINGS LIKE SEA GRASSES -- AS M.. AREAS WHERE YOU MIGHT FIND LOCAL AMELIORATION POTENTIAL -- AND PILOTS AND KNEW IT NEW PARTNERSHIPS NEW COLLABORATIONS WITH FISHING COMMUNITIES TO BEGIN. TO LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT SUPPORT ADAPTATION STEPS INTO THE FUTURE THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE OUR WAY AFTER THE VISIT IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM -- SO I THINK FINDING THOSE WAYS THAT WE CAN -- SO TO MITIGATE IMPACTS -- IT IS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. CANDIDLY HOW FAR BEHIND. THE EIGHT BALL DO YOU BELIEVE CALIFORNIA IS AT THIS POINT. OF BEING ABLE TO REACT TO WHAT THAT NEW REALITY IS. I CANDIDLY -- I'VE I FEEL VERY PLEASED TO BE IN CALIFORNIA -- WORKING ON THIS ISSUE ISSUE WE ARE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO PRODUCE AN ACTION PLAN AND TO HAVE PRIORITY TO INVEST IN THAT ACTION PLAN -- SO I THINK WE ARE POISED TO TACKLE IT IN THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN. IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR WORKING WITH HER PEERS -- THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON IT -- PEERS THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST AND ALSO INTERNATIONALLY I MEAN FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS A GLOBAL COP AN ISSUE AS WELL -- AND  THINK IT CARS BOTH THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL DIALOG EXTRA THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS RESTAURANT. I GUESS JUST A FEW COMMENTS AND IF WE START. BROADLY AS TALKING TO SCIENTISTS ABOUT THE NORTH EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN THE THING I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND. THEY TALK ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY ONES THAT ARE. TRACKING RIGHT ORGANISMS. LARGE SCALE. PROJECT READ ORGANISMS THERE'S MORE AS MUCH OR MORE VARIETY AND AND CAPACITY IS THEY TALK ABOUT IS THEIR DADDY WE WE THINK WE HAVE IMAGES OF THE SERENGETI DESERT AND THAT. THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS AND HOW EXCITING THAT IS WE HAVE THAT OFF OF OUR SHORES. AND WE SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THIS. IN OUR INSHORE WATERS WE TALK ABOUT THE FISHERY FISHING INDUSTRY BUT THIS IS WHAT'S WITH ULTIMATELY AT STAKE. AND WITH THE OCEAN BEING THE THE BUFFER FOR A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CLIMATE THE MORE WE KNOW IN THE MORE WE WORK WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND ESPECIALLY UP AND DOWN. THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN NORTH EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN THAT THE MORE INROADS I THINK WE CAN MAKE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROTECTING AND THAT'S WHAT'S WORTH LOOKING AT KEEPING THAT VIBRANT. OCEAN ENVIRONMENTS AND THE FISHERIES INVOLVED IN IT WITH ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL AND AND ALL OF ITS HUMAN POTENTIAL THAT THAT REPRESENTS. AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS. ALWAYS PRETTY WELL BECAUSE OF WHAT WILL BE DONE AND WHAT. THE OCEANSIDE STRESS DOES THAN WHAT THE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS. BRINGING REAL SCIENCE INTO THE CONVERSATION AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT LISTENING TO THE FISHERMEN TALK HERE AND THIS CONVERSATION THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING ON SHORE WOULD WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WILDFIRES HERE. IN THE FISHERIES COUNCIL. AND WHAT HAPPENS N SHORE WITH WHAT HAPPENS OFF SHORE SOMETHING THAT IS JUST IN THE EIGHT TO THE FLEET AND TO THOSE INTERACTIONS. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW CALIFORNIA'S BEEN STRUCTURED. AGENCY BY AGENCY OR DIFFERENT GROUPS THEY TEND TO BE FRESH WATER FOCUSED OR SO. AND THIS IS THE A VERY INTERESTING PLACE WHERE THAT ALL COMES TOGETHER. BECAUSE IT COMES TOGETHER NATURALLY HERE FISHERMEN UNDERSTAND THAT PLEASE. SO WAS AS WE RAZORS YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF TESTING AND THE FUNDS THAT ARE NECESSARY I ALSO KNOW THAT. THAT WITH THE WAY WE'VE DONE FISH COUNTING WONDERING OTHER MONITORING THEIR FEDERAL FUNDED STATE FUNDS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY WE'RE REALLY AT RISK OF LOSING THIS LONG TERM. SCIENTIFIC BASIS IF WE STOP OR IF WE ALLOW TO STOP THE KINDS OF MONITORING THAT HAS HAPPENED. AND WATER QUALITY MONITORING WHETHER IT'S ON OR OFFSHORE. THAT OCEAN CONDITIONS THAT CHEMISTRY THE OCEAN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE COLLECTING IN INVESTING IN. THAT BROADER SCIENTIFIC DATA SO THAT WE CAN BRING THEM TO THESE KINDS OF FOR AND SOCIAL PROTECTION COUNCIL AT OCEANSIDE STRESSED. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE DATA TO START TO KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WITH THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE THESE ARE VERY LARGE INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS. AND WE'RE SEEING A WEATHER WITH TIMO CASTED CHANGING TEMPERATURES THAT ARE DRIVING SPECIES CHANGES THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE ON A REAL TIME BASIS. AND HOW WE MANAGE THIS BIG QUESTION BECOMES. VERY DIFFICULT THREE TWO BUT WE ARE STARTING WITH THOSE THE PIECES TOGETHER AND THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. AND THROUGH OTHERS. MAKING SURE WE'RE BRINGING THAT THE SCIENCE IN THE LEGISLATIVE CONTACTS SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. IS IS A KEY FOR US COLLECTIVELY TO FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT AWARENESS AND THAT'S WHY. I HAD LUNCH IN THE SUMMERTIME. TO THIS COMMITTEE THIS JOINT COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIR WITH UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THE FACT THAT WE ARE HAVING MORE HEARINGS THAT ARE HEARING OUR IN DEPTH THAT WE'RE NOT STARTING. WE'RE NOT JUST HEARING THIS AND WORKING WITH THE FISHERMEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS YES THE FOOD LAST NIGHT WAS LOVELY AND WE DO THAT BUT THE ONGOING CONVERSATION AND BRING SCIENCE INTO. THE CONVERSATION ON A REGULAR BASIS IS IS REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. AND THAT'S WHY I AGREE WITH DOCTOR WHITE AND THAT I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE CALIFORNIA NOW AND VERY HOPEFUL THAT EVEN AS WE TACKLE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. AND HAVE HAD LONG STANDING DEBATES IN CONVERSATIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT SECTORS INVOLVED HERE. THAT WE ARE STARTING TO MAKE PROGRESS. ON INDIVIDUAL LEVELS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE SIT ON THE SHORES OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PIECES OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY IN THE WORLD AND AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN AND TO TO HELP US MANAGE THIS WILL REALLY DOING HOPING WE IN THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SHORTFALLS IN TESTING. AND PROVIDE SOME OF THAT CONTINUITY AND BRING IN. THAT DOES NUTS AND BOLTS PIECES UPDATED THEY WORK SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED. SO THIS IS THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES. AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THAT AND AND LOOKING AT WHERE WE HAVE RELIED ON FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THAT ANYMORE OR WHERE THE STATE HAS BEEN FUN THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS PICTURE WE'RE TYING THOSE TOGETHER. AND FINDING THOSE IN A IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER BECAUSE THE SCIENTISTS IN THE FASHION THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED. THAT DATA AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TRY AND SORT OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT IN THE LONG RUN SO I APPRECIATE THE REPORTS. THE HOPEFULNESS BUT ALSO THE THE SORT OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EACH OF THE PIECES. OF THE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE AND THE PROGRESS THAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO MAKE OVER THE YEARS BUT SO. WELL SIR THANK YOU I THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A QUESTION. BUT JUST LISTENING TO YOU TALK IN THOSE AREAS THEY JUST STRIKES ME THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE AND THE GAPS IN WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING AND WHETHER IT'S PERMITTING FOR GETTING DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO TALK TO EACH OTHER THAT HADN'T AND LOOK. MORE HOLISTICALLY AT WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE IN THE VARIOUS ECOSYSTEMS. THAT HAVE ON ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S OFTEN BEEN LACKING IN -- POLICY MAKING FRAMEWORK AND THAT'S WHAT. THIS COMMITTEE REALLY AND START TO DO OR HAS BEEN DOING AND CONTINUES TO DO. THANK YOU SO MUCH PLEASE I JUST WANT TO ADD TO THAT YES AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHALES AND WHALE INTEGUMENT WERE THE DENTURES CAPTION YOU'RE WORKING GROUP AND THE CRUX OF THE RAMP IS. FIND A DATA INPUT SO GOES RIGHT BACK TO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH IT'S SO SO HEARING WHERE THE SHORTFALLS ARE IN UNDERSTANDING THOSE UP. FOR TALKING ALOUD TO OURSELVES HERE TOO WE NEED TO INTERNALIZE THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THOSE AND THOSE MECHANISMS IN PLACE HERE THROUGH OUR BUDGETARY PROCESS. AND ENSURE THAT THAT THAT WERE WHERE TO GO FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS NOW IF THESE DATA STREAMS STOP. THE THAT'S TOTALLY VERY CRITICAL FOR US NO THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS RESCUE PLEASE I COULD ADD A COMMENT TO THAT -- WE'RE IN IN THE RESTORATION INDUSTRY WERE WERE VERY GOOD AT THE TRACTOR PART OF THE RESTORATION WE KNOW HOW TO TAKE OUT CULBERTSON PUTTING BRIDGES WE NOT A PUT. LOGS AND STRUCTURES IN STRINGS TO CREATE HABITAT WELL WE'RE NOT REAL GOOD AT AND WE DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR IS THE PLANNING. THE UP FRONT STRATEGIC PLANNING AND AND BUILDING IN THE SCIENCE INTO OUR RESTORATION AND THEN THE FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE MONITORING AND WE NEED THAT DATA WE NEED THAT SCIENTIFIC STRUCTURE AND THE DATA TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND. ITS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR NOW ARE BEING EFFECTIVE WE REALLY NEED THAT THAT SCIENTIFIC STRUCTURE IN IT AND IT DOESN'T COME FROM THE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT DOESN'T COME FROM TE BOND FUNDS. WE NEED A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO DO THOSE THINGS. IT WAS JUST TALKING WITH THE SECRETARIES OF ABOUT THIS AS WE CREATE BONDS IN IN SOME OF THE OTHERS. BECAUSE WE WE FIND SOME OF THE SEXY STUFF SO INTERESTING OFF THE BUS BUT NOT THE PLANNING YOUR RIGHT AND NOT THE MONITORING. THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO EVEN APPLY FOR SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TO BE ABLE TO APPLY TO DO THE PLANNING. AND WERE WERE FAMOUS FOR MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE SHOVEL READY BECAUSE THAT SUFFICIENT THAT'S EFFECTIVE BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE POINT OF BEING SHOVEL READY. WITHOUT THE PLANNING. AND HOW DO WE EVEN UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE IF WE COULD HAVE THAT LONGER TERM LINES FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PUT THE RIGHT PROGRAMS IN PLACE WITHOUT THAT PLANNING AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT WITHOUT THE MONITORING PIECES. IT'S ALMOST THAT. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE PROJECTS? BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BENEFIT THE PROJECTS IT. WITHOUT. THE WITHOUT THE MONITORING AND WAR WITH THE NEXT PROJECT SHOULD BE WITHOUT THE MODERATE SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE VERY EARLY AND FOR THE BACK INTO THE PROJECT SOMETHING IN THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD BE. AND WE HEAR THIS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS FROM THE AGENCIES THAT ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT IT TRY TO FIND WAYS TO DRAW DOWN THE MONEY. SO THE YEAH THANK YOU POINT WELL TAKEN. THANK YOU.

THE CRAP INDUSTRIES TALK ABOUT GAY RETRIEVAL -- NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT ALL THE GEAR OF THEIRS THAT I RETRIEVE OFF THE BEACH AND THAT'S THE ROPES THE TRAPS THE BIG JARS THE BULLIES. AND ALL OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED STUFF THAT BACKGROUND INTO TINY BITS -- I'VE REACHED OUT TO DECALOGUE. HE REACHED OUT TO THE OTHER FISHERMEN IN TODAY TO PAY.

THERE'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A A TECHNICIAN MUCH LAST GAME WARDEN OVERSIGHT. AND YOU KNOW REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT THERE KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE GUYS -- THE THE GEAR THAT I PICK UP. OUR WELL I TALKED I TALKED ABOUT THAT -- YEAH I GUESS I DON'T WANT.

WE DEVELOP THE GOOD SUSTAINABLE RENEWABLE FISHERY FOR THE RED SEA CUCUMBER. ALL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE FISHERMEN IT'S JUST A FEW FISHERMEN IN THIS GROUP GOT ALL BALSAM DIED THE GOLD SOMEONE BROKE IN. THE STRONG ONES LIKE MYSELF WERE STILL HERE BUT ALL THE PROCESSOR IS IMPORTANT TO THEM TOO BECAUSE AS A NEW UNIQUE PROCESSING -- THING THAT HAPPENS TO PROCESS THE SEA CUCUMBER THEY'RE ACTUALLY COOKED AND DRIED. AND THEY'RE SOLD DRIED AND THEN THEY'RE RECONSTITUTED -- INTO OF ACTUALLY OF PROTEIN PRODUCT. AND VERY GOOD FOR MALES THAT IS GOOD FOR MALES IT'S GOOD DEED FOR THE PREPARED CORRECTLY AND ALL. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED PROBABLY. DIFFERENT KINDS OF CUCUMBERS IN THE WORLD ON THIS I SEE ON THE DRIED MARKET IS A BALL NUMBER THREE IN VALUE. SO IT HAS A GOOD VALUE TO A AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE OUR FISHERY. IT'S A LIMITED ENTRY FISHERY THERE'S NOT VERY MANY PERMITS LEFT NOW.

GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS DAVID GOLDENBERG I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF A DETERRENT BUT THE MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA SEVEN COUNSELING CALIFORNIA SEA URCHIN COMMISSION. THAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THE SALMON BUT AS THE SALMON COUNCIL WE ARE THE MARKETING ENTITY THAT HELPED MARKETING. AND THAT PROMOTE THE THE FISH SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIS YEAR WITH A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME FISH TO MARKET LAST THREE YEARS IT'S BEEN KIND OF LEAN. BUT LIGHT -- ATTACK ON TO WHAT JIM ANDERSON SAID EARLIER AND ALSO LAURIE FRENCH THAT FEWER AND FEWER FISHERMEN HAS BEEN OUT THERE BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN MUCH OPPORTUNITY. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IS STILL AMOUNT TO ITS FEWER FACE THEN WE'VE NORMALLY AT THE MARKET AND SO -- AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT FOR A PROFIT AND SO WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE SPENDING AROUND TRYING TO FIND FISH -- WITH MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE HAVEA PROFITABLE TIME AND AND KAY AND AND HAVE SOMEPLACE TO MARKET DIVISION BASICALLY WE'RE STARTING OUT FROM SCRATCH. AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT THAT OFTEN HE SEVENTEEN I KNOW THAT IT'S NOW UP TO CONGRESS AS HANDS TO SUPPLY THE PROCREATION BUT ANYTHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN DO. TO HELP GET US TO THE FINISH LINE TO BRING THOSE PHONES ON WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. ON ZERO TEN YOU'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MR TRUMP WERE AND HOW DIRE THE SITUATION IS AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND ALSO THE GOVERNOR AND THEY ALSO DEPARTMENT. FOR HELPING US GET THE SECOND ROUND OF APPROPRIATION REQUEST WAS OVER DISASTER REQUEST. FOR THE C. H. INDUSTRY BUT IN TALKING TO MY CHAIRMAN -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SITUATION IS GETTING WORSE SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A DISASTER IN 201-620-1720 EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN ARE NOT WELL AT ALL. AND SO -- I KNOW WITH THE PURPLE SITUATION IN THE FORT BRAG AREA IN YOUR DISTRICT. THAT A LOT OF FISHERMEN ARE GOING OUT AND WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO REMOVE SO THE PURPLES. TO MAKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AND CLEARING A PATH FOR THEIR HELP TO COME BACK. BUT THEY'RE CALLING THE PHONE TOGETHER GOOD DEALS TWENTY STABILITY AND AND AND SECURE FUNDING WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP REGARDING LANDING TAXES BECAUSE WE WERE HERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND DECLARING HOW HEART HOPEFULLY WERE. AND WE'LL PREVIEW YOUR LEADERSHIP WITH LOOKING AT A MORE PREDICTABLE A FUTURE FOR A LANDING TAXES EVEN THOUGH -- IT'S HARD. TO PAY THOSE BUT HAVING PREDICTABLE FEATURES. FOR IN THEM GO THROUGH THEIR EXERCISE WITH THE BUDGETING PROCESS AS WELL BECAUSE THAT WILL. SHOW THE NEED FOR WHAT FISHERIES ARE COSTING AND TO MANAGE THEM SO. ALL TOGETHER WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU YEAH DAVID THANK YOU SO MUCH MAKE YOUR COMMENTS BEEN TAKING NOTES AS YOU'VE BEEN. TALKING AS WELL IN WERE GREAT FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN YOUR ADVOCACY AND SO HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY THANK YOU A CANADIAN WORK LIKE WORKING WITH THE GERMAN TLF HECK YES.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT HEARING YOUR ANNUAL -- JOINT COMMITTEE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO COMING UP TO SACRAMENTO TO SEE YOU GUYS AND HE WAS GOING ON I LEARNED SO MUCH. I'M JUST FOCUSING TODAY A LITTLE BIT ON SOMETHING I THINK CENTER KIND OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT MIGHT HELP ON THE DEMO GAS IT SITUATION. I'VE SEEN LITTLE BABY SEA LIONS STARVING AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN'T UNSEE. AND I KNOW IT IF THE LG IS AFFECTING THE CRABS AND SO I THOUGHT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT MY FEET THAT WE FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT SOMEONE [inaudible] THE PHOSPHORUS AMMONIA AS AND THE WHAT'S THE OTHER. ONE US HERE IS -- MANANA AND NITROGEN -- AND THAT IS JUST FLOWING DOWN OUR CREEKS INTO RIVERS AND IT'S GOING IN THE OCEAN AND THAT CREATES ALGAE BLOOMS IS SOMETHING. WE CAN CONTROL WE CAN THIS REALLY CONTROL CLIMATE CHANGE TOMORROW BUT WE CAN CONTROL WHAT GOES INTO OUR STREAMS. WHICH IS HARMING OUR FISHERIES. AND OF COURSE IT'S CREATING YOU KNOW HYPOXIC AREAS THAT CREATE WHICH THE OXYGEN OUT OF THE WATER AND THEN YOU HAVE -- HE FISH GOING FURTHER OUT TO SEA TO GET OXYGEN AND FOOD AND THAT RESULTS IN SOME BABY SEA LIONS STARVING. SO IT'S ALL CONNECTED SO I MY SOLUTION WOULD BE YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE REGIONAL BOARDS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STOP SOME OF THE SEDIMENTATION -- THAT SEEMS TO BE A IS SOMETHING THAT THIS IS OUR DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY ALREADY SO IT'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THE I. CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER ON OUR RUN OFF ISSUES -- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY -- INDUSTRIES AND FISH AND W SHOULD MARKET IT AT A HIGHER PRICE WE WOULD HAVE TO HARVEST AS MUCH. FISHERMEN COULD MAKE A LIVING AND WE COULD LEAVE MORE FISH IN THE OCEAN I THINK THAT'S IT AND THE SUPERBOWL GOAL IS TO SAY WE HAVE THE BEST FISH AND THAT WAY. EVERYBODY CAN SURVIVE AND MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING MARKETING APPROACH -- I DON'T REALLY I'M NOT TOO EXCITED ABOUT HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING FOR INSULATED INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. TO TAKE WHALES BECAUSE OF ENTANGLEMENTS -- INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT MEANS IT'S OKAY TAKE. SPECIES AND I WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE A STATE TO PURSUE THAT. MYSELF I THINK THAT WE CANCEL THIS ANOTHER WAY -- IN I THINK THIRTY PARTS PER MILLION I JUST LEARNING SO MUCH TODAY -- FOR OUR DEMO GAS LEVELS I THINK WE SHOULD. GO FOR THAT AND WE SHOULD GO LOWER I MEAN WE SHOULD WEAR CALIFORNIA WE CAN GO BETTER WE CAN HAVE THE CLEANEST CRABS AND NOT. THE SECOND FIDDLE TO WASHINGTON OREGON SO I'D SAY LET'S. WORK ON THE RUN OFFICE ISSUES AND THAT COULD THAT COULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. REALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. IN IN.

THE RECENT EXPERIENCE ON THE WORKING GROUP DID REVEAL THAT WE WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF KNOWING WHERE THE GEAR IS -- AND SO WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT SOLAR LOGGERS SHOULD BE EXPANDED OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FLEET. AND AND AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPC AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO RUN THE RAP PROGRAM -- WE ASIDE FROM WELL TEN MINUTES WE SUPPORT ADDITIONAL EXPANDED C. D. F. W. FUNDING IN PARTICULAR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR FISHERIES AT THE COMMISSION JUST COMPLETED -- IS IT IS A HUGELY VALUABLE -- PIECES THAT THEY CAN BE I THINK VERY.

VERY EXCITING TO SEE THAT COLLABORATION ACROSS THE NGOS -- INDUSTRY AND AND THE AGENCY -- AND JUST LASTLY -- WE DO REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF CONSERVATION REPRESENTATION ON THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL -- ON THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION IN PARTICULAR BUT WE DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH FEDERAL MANAGEMENT OF ANCHOVY WHICH IS CURRENTLY IGNORING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED BY RENEWED EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND REINTRODUCED HARMFUL PELAGIC LONG LINES OFF THE WEST COAST THEY'VE BEEN BANNED HERE FOR FORTY YEARS DO TECHNIQUES -- HIGH LEVELS OF BI CATCH UP SO WE WE DO -- CONTINUE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH FISHERMEN AND AND AND AND REALLY SEE THAT THAT IS THE ANSWER TO SOLVING MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS THANK YOU.

NO OP NOT COMMENTS TODAY FOR ORGANIZATION. ONE AD THE I WAS A SPECIFIC ESPECIALLY. IN FAVOR OF WHAT. ASSEMBLYMAN DOLLY WAS SAYING ABOUT FOREST PRODUCING CLEAN WATER [inaudible] AND ABOUT HAVING A BALANCED BETWEEN THE USES OF WATER. NO THERE'S MORE DEMAND FOR WATER THAN THERE IS SUPPLY. THE SUPPLY IS BEING DIVIDED UP POLITICALLY AND NOT. AS EQUITABLY AS WE WOULD LIKE THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET. THAT CONGRESS DESIGNATED FOR US. FROM THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WE HAVEN'T SEEN A DROP OF THAT. IN THE MANY YEARS [inaudible] SO -- WE WILL NOT LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA VICE RE COMMITTEE THAT WERE THE REASON ORIGINAL REASON FOR THIS HEARING. EVERY YEAR WITH OUR REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN ON THAT COMMITTEE FOR MANY YEARS LOOKING BACK [inaudible] WE FIND [inaudible] THAT. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EARLIER ON ARE STILL APPROPRIATE TODAY AND SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT. BUT WOULD IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO LOOK BACK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CHC AND TOM HAS. POSTED THEM ON THE WEBSITE SO THERE REALLY SHOULD FIND IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE NEW. HABITAT COMMITTEE OF THE PACIFIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. HAD A POLICY HAS A NEW POLICY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NET LOSS. IN THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF ANY MARINE ASTRAEA REMAIN OR FRESHWATER HABITATS THIS THIS DAN. RESERVE EXAMINED. THE CITY COUNCIL REASSURED CO EQUAL TREATMENT WITH OTHER PURPOSES OF WATER AND LAND RESOURCE. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THERE'S THE BALANCE THAT WE'RE SEEKING AGAIN. DID ANY OF THAT ON ONE MINUTE WHICH OF WE HAD A HATCHERY. MANAGERS COME TO THE CSE MEETING YESTERDAY. AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. LEGALLY HOT WATER IN THE RIVERS BLOW THEIR HATCHERIES FOR THE NATURALLY SPAWNING. SALMON. THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT REPORT SAID A REASONABLE GOAL WOULD BE TO DOUBLE STATEWIDE SALMON PRODUCTION BY. TWENTY TEN THIS DOUBLE LANGUAGE DURING THIS THE STATE'S ECONOMY BY GENERATING A FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS AND INCREASING REVENUES. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND BE WORTH SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES. AND THAT WOULD BE DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT IN TODAY'S DOLLARS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD VERY LOW INFLATION FORTUNATELY. I WANTED TO REMIND ASSEMBLYMAN DOLLY THAT FISHERMEN ALSO PRODUCE FOOD FOR PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE AGRICULTURE FOLKS. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND I WANT TO PRESENT YOU.
