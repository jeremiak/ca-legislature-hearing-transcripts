CALIFORNIA LAW CONTINUE TO PERPETRATE CENTURY OLD INHUMANE INEQUITABLE PRACTICES THAT REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT IT FELT IT SEXUAL PROPERTY. ACTUAL PROPERTY AND PROVIDE EVERY VOCAL CONSENT THIS IS WRONG AND WE MUST CORRECT IT AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE PROVIDE PARITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE STANDARDS FOR SPOUSAL RAPE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PENAL CODE.

THANK YOU WE NEED TO PROMOTE RAPE CULTURE CRIMES INVOLVING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE HAVE A UNIQUE IMPACT ON SURVIVORS OFFERING LAYERED WITH EXTENSIVE TRAUMA RESPONSE TO IS A LONG LASTING IMPACT OF TRAUMA OCCURRED REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT AT THE MINUTE TALENT WITH THE SURVIVOR. OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. MOREOVER A PERSON WHO COMMITS RAPE SHOULD NOT BE SHIELDED FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MARRIED TO THE VICTIM. A CERTIFICATE OF MERIT SHOULD NOT PROVIDE MORE LENIENT LEGAL OUTCOME. REGARDLESS OF THE RATE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BREAKAGE RATE.

AT THIS TIME WE MUST REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE TAKES DISCRETION FROM JUDGES DISMISSES THE DESIRES AND NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND STRIPPED DEVELOPMENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED CALIFORNIANS FROM THE CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH THEIR SPOUSES. ON A PERSONAL NOTE AS A RAPE SURVIVOR AND A PUBLIC DEFENDER. WE ALL WANT TO END RIGHT THAT TOOK COMPANY LOS WILL NOT CHANGE RAPE CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY. I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE HISTORY OF GREAT LOSS AND THE FUTILITY OF HARSH PUNISHMENT FOR RAPE AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN OF FORTY EIGHT STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COSTA BRYCE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR RAPE OF AN ADULT WOMAN. I NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ON THE EVE OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S BERMAN DECISION FINDING THAT THE DEATH PENALTY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS SUPPORTING THE DEATH PENALTY FOR RAPE OF AN ADULT WOMAN HAD DECLINED TO SIXTEEN STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I GREW UP IN JIM CROW GEORGIA WHERE CONVICTION FOR RAPE COULD BRING THE DEATH PENALTY. THAT DID NOT THEN WAIT IT ONLY MEANT THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CHARGED CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR BLACK MEN ACCUSED OF RAPING WHITE WOMEN. IN FACT IN GEORGIA THE GREAT HAD INITIALLY BEEN DEFINED AS ONLY THE RATE OF EIGHT WHITE FEMALE BY A BLACK MAN. IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR HENSON HOWARD A BLACK MAN WAS THE FIRST PERSON. ALECTRA Q. DID BY THE STATE OF GEORGIA WEDNESDAY. ENTRY FOR RIGHT AND BARBARI WHEN THEY FIRST USED ELECTRIC CHAIR. TODAY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN TO THE RAVAGES OF MASS INCARCERATION WE'RE TRYING TO RECLAIM OUR BUDGET FROM CDC ARE AND STANDARD INSTEAD FOR COMMUNITY PROGRAMS WHICH MAKE PEOPLE SAFER AND HE'LL PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT HARM OTHERS OR THEMSELVES. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE IS A THROWBACK TO AN EARLIER FAILED PUBLIC POLICY WHERE WE START TO SOLVE OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY SENDING ALL OFFENDERS TO STATE PRISON. AND ADDING ALL SEX OFFENDERS TO SEX OFFENDER REGISTRIES. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WILL TAKE DISCRETION AWAY FROM OUR JUDGES AND REQUIRE THEM TO SENATE ALMOST THE WHOLE TOWN RATE THIS TO STATE PRISON AND LIFETIME SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION. REGARDLESS OF THE VICTIM'S WISHES OUR ECONOMIC NEEDS. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE MORE CRIMINALIZED THE SEXUAL LIVES OF THE SPOUSES OF DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUALS SINCE UNDER THE RAPE LAWS THE INDIVIDUAL MODE THAT THE DISABILITY WILL BE DEALING TO HAVE NO CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO SEX. I BELIEVE THAT TO END RAPE CULTURE WE MUST EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN ABOUT WOMEN'S HISTORY AND SPEAK OUT. NOT SEND MORE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESENT AND MAKE THEM UNEMPLOYABLE WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED BECAUSE THEY'RE ON AN INTERNET SEX REGISTRY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM.

TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH POWER CAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANTTO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK ON THIS MATTER I THINK THAT THE FIRST WITNESS SAID IT BEST THAT RAPE IS RAPE FULL STOP I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY DISCUSSION BEYOND THAT AND I JUST HAD TO ADDRESS ONE THING THAT WAS SAID BY THE OPPOSITION WHICH I'VE HEARD IN THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE WHICH IS CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS ON WOMEN'S WHICH MAKES ME AS A WOMAN. LIKE I AM BEING TAKEN BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THAT I SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT RAPE FROM MY SPOUSE BECAUSE IT IS IN THE BEST ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF ME AND PERHAPS MY CHILDREN WHICH IS FRANKLY APPALLING TO ME I JUST THINK IT IS WE ARE DONE WITH THE DAYS OF PATERNALISM WHERE WE DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR WOMEN. AND WHAT IS BEST FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE IS FOR RAPE TO BE TREATED LIKE RAPE I DON'T CARE WHO THE PERSON WHO VICTIMIZES YOU IS WHETHER THEY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR A STRANGER OR SOMEONE IN BETWEEN IT IS RAPE AND SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE SAME AND THAT IS WHAT THE AUTHOR IS DOING HERE TODAY AND I THINK THIS IS COMMENDABLE WORK I THINK OUR LAW IS OUTDATED AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE UP RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU TO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS. OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE UPDATED. I AGREE THAT RAPE IS RAPE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT WE'RE NOT. TRYING TO DO WHAT WE THINK IS RIGHT. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT A BILL DOESN'T HARM. EVEN THOUGH IS TRYING TO HELP. AND THAT. AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT SOMEONE HAS COME FROM A CIVIL RIGHTS BACKGROUND. AS A FATHER. WHO HAS A DAUGHTER WHO'S MARRIED. WHO DOESN'T WANT HIS SON IN LAW RAPING. HIS DAUGHTER. BUT MOST IMPORTANT. AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM AND SURVIVOR OF A PET A FILE. AND A FAMILY MEMBER. THEY TRY TO RAPE ME. I KNOW MORE ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE FAX THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS THAT COULD HAVE ON AN INDIVIDUAL. AND I FIND IT. PROBLEMATIC. THAT WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS. AND I WILL READ TO YOU TO LET ME OF THINGS THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT NOT ONLY DO WE CLOSE THE GAP SAID NO ONE GETS AWAY WITH RAPE. I REPEAT I AGREE THAT RAPE IS RAPE I'M A **** ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY TIME. AT THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID TO ME AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THIS. I'M JUST GOING TO LAY IT OUT. SO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. AND THAT I WAS NOT TRYING TO STALL THIS AS THE CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY. I'M JUST LISTENING TO ONE SIDE. AT THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL WOMEN. THAT ARE IN MARITAL SITUATIONS. AS SOMEONE THAT GREW UP AND THAT'S- IN A FAMILY WHERE THERE WAS ABUSE GOING ON. I KNOW HOW DEVASTATING THAT IS BUT I ALSO FIND IT APPALLING THAT I HAD DE ACE. COME TO ME AND TELL ME THAT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AFFECT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DON'T GET MARRIED IT IS MOSTLY GOING TO GO AFTER. WHITE MEN. THAT TO ME THAT'S RACES PERIOD SIMPLE LAST RACE. THAT'S WHAT BOTHERED ME. NOBODY EVER ASKED ME AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM NOBODY S. B. FOR A BLACK MAN TO ADMIT THAT WAS ALMOST STOPPED SODOMIZED BY HIS. FAMILY MEMBER. IT'S PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING THAT ANYONE CAN DO. AND SO WHEN I HAVE SOMEONE LOOK BEFORE YOU BERMAN ON THE CROSS OF THE OF THE LAWN OF MY OPINIONS. YOU NEED TO GET TO KNOW ME. YOU NEED TO GET TO KNOW MY PAIN. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. ABOUT WHY I WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT A PARTICULAR BILL ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M DEALING WITH. D. A.'S THAT ARE TELLING ME THAT THEY CAN WEAPONIZE THIS. AGAINST WHITE MEN. VICTIMS RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE A WOULD IGNORE IT ABSOLUTELY NEVER NEVER NEVER BUT YOU SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS ANY VICTIM SHOULD NOT BE A WAR IGNORED. I HAVE A STATEMENT. THAT WAS WRITTEN FOR ME. BY MY NEW CHIEF CONSULTANT FEMALE LATINA BECAUSE EVIDENTLY YEP I BRING IT UP IS VIEWED. AS A MALE NOT BEING CONCERNED ABOUT A WOMAN. AND THEIR THEIR THEIR RIGHTS IN THEIR ABILITY. TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT THEY WANT. I AGREE THAT RAPE IS RAPE. THAT IS WHY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA IS BILL AB SEVENTY WHICH DECLARES THAT ALL. FORMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE CONSIDERED RATE. BUT EVEN THOUGH RAPE IS RAPE NOT ALL VICTIMS ARE THE SAME SOME VICTIMS MAY NOT WANT THE PERPETRATOR SPOUSE TO GO TO PRISON THIS IS FROM MY MAIL. CHIEF OF STAFF DOES NOT MEET TALK. SOME VICTIMS THIS IS THIS CAN BE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME RESIDENTS STATED FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RECONCILE AND YES SOME OF IT FOR FINANCIAL REASONS BUT THE OTHER IS WHAT IF A WOMAN DOESN'T WANT. BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS THEY DON'T REPORT RAPE. WHAT IF THEY DON'T REPORT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR HUSBAND TO GO TO PRISON OR HAVE A SEXUAL OFFENSE. ON THEIR RECORD. NOW YOU VICTIMS CHANGE THAT PERSON. TO STAY IN A MARRIAGE OR TO STAY IN A SITUATION THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT. SOME VICTIMS MAY HAVE GIVEN UP A CAREER OR NOT BUT YOU NEED TO GOTO SCHOOL AND CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE A SECOND OR POSSIBLY THE ONLY FAMILY INCOME WHICH IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE COURT MUST SENTENCE A PERPETRATOR SPOUSE TO PRISON. FOR PEOPLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING. IN ADDITION REQUIRING MANDATORY SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WE'LL HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE LASTING CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AND STIGMA TO THE FAMILY. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE COURT TO TAKE THE VICTIM'S WISHES INTO CONSIDERATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY IN A MANY WAYS THIS BILL WILL PREVENT THAT. AND SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH THE HAVE MORE DISCUSSION WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS WHEN I ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT. HOW INEFFECTIVE THIS LAW THAT WE HAVE NOW IS AND HOW WE CAN CLOSE THE GAPS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE SAID NO ONE. THE FIRST ONE THAT'S ONE TOO MANY. BAD NO WOMEN HAVE TO SUFFER THAT. IN ADDITION IF SOMETHING HAPPENS WHERE AND I'VE BEEN A DIFFICULT DIVORCE. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH. AND THAT PERSON SAYS. TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DID THAT SOMEONE RAPED THEM. AND THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT OR LOOKED AT LIKE WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT WOMEN. BECAUSE THERE ISN'T. AN INDIVIDUAL NAMED EMMETT TILL THAT BECAUSE OF A LACK. YES BY WHITE WOMEN. HE WAS BRUTALLY KILLED. SOMEONE LIFE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DIDN'T GO AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU NEED TO GO TO EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE BRYAN STEVENSON THE ALABAMA TO SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE LYNCHED. AFTER AMERICAN BEEN LYNCHED. I'VE HAD WOMEN CAUCUS MEMBERS AND MARRIED WOMEN TELL ME ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS AND MY SUPPOSED TO IGNORE THEM. DO YOU WANT ME TO IGNORE WHAT THEY SAID WHAT DO WE NEED TO BRING THOSE COMMENTS IN HERE LISTEN TO THEM. A FIGURE OUT A WAY WE CAN HELP EVERYBODY. RAPE IS RAPE. RAPE IS RAPE. THE REASON I BROUGHT THIS HERE THE REASON I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BETTER GET MOVED OUT. IT'S BECAUSE I AM HOPING. THAT WE JUST DON'T. RUSH TO JUDGMENT JUST BECAUSE- IS THE THING TO DO OR WHERE FRAYED. TO TRY TO ACTIVELY MAKE THIS DONE CORRECTLY AND I HOPE. AT THE- THAT THE SUPPORTERS. AND OF THIS ANY AUTHOR. WILL WORK WITH ME AND THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE THE REASON I'M MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS COULD THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE SAID THAT THEY WOULD WORK WITH ME. IT THERE IS A PROBLEM. IF IT ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY ON BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS. BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES IF HIS DETERIORATION OF THAT. THAT WE WOULD COME BACK. AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR IF WE HAD TO. I MAKE THOSE CHANGES BECAUSE- WE CAN WE CAN START A LAW IN IN JANUARY FEBRUARY AND DO AN URGENCY CLAUSE AND MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS THAT'S WHAT I OFFERED. THAT WE WOULD DO THAT WE WOULD TAKE THIS TIME TO DO THIS. AND SO I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ONLY VERY IMPORTANT. TWO TWO WOMEN TO MARRIED WOMEN AND YES TWO MEN. MEN WHO ARE AND NOT WHO WERE IN GAY MARRIAGES THAT COULD HAPPEN TO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE VICTIMS THAT ARE PART OF THAT ALSO. AND SO IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE TAKE THIS VERY VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE- HAS THE RIGHT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. TURN THIS LAW INTO SOMETHING THEY BECOME SOMETHING DAMAGING THAT WE HAVE TO FIX LATER. AND WITH THAT CALL FOR THE. ON AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE BY SOME MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI CONSIDER IRAQI LACKEY ADDED BARRICADE HAND BACKHAND HI COURT.
