00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.612
WE FOUND OUT A FIVE PM ON FRIDAY

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:22.779
THAT WE ARE DOING THIS BILL SO

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:23.313
NOW.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.515
OKAY IS THERE WITNESSES IN

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:27.117
OPPOSITION.

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:28.318
WE HAVE ONE NO.

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.454
OPPOSITION.

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.889
SORT OF I HAVEN'T BEEN STAFFING

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:34.124
THIS BILL SO -- I JUST TOOK OVER

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.792
FOR THE PERSON WHO'S ON LEAVE --

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:38.195
I UNDERSTAND WE HAD SOME

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:40.264
CONCERNS WE TALKED ABOUT IT OF

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.532
THE ADVISORY BOARD AS FAR AS I

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.267
KNOW WE DON'T HAVE DECISION

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.269
MAKING POWERS WERE AFRAID THAT

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:46.436
THIS MIGHT RESULT IN GOVERNMENT

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:48.472
WASTE -- BY HAVING TO HAVE OPEN

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:49.673
MEETINGS AND SCHEDULED MEETINGS

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.909
JUST TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:52.576
THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE DECISIONS

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.678
ON SO I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:56.713
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE -- SOME

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.015
MEMBERS ON OUR BOARD LIKE THE

00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.250
IDEA OF MAKING MORE TRANSPARENCY --

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.752
SO THE REASON WE'RE STILL IN

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.353
OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE WE

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.489
ACTUALLY SUPPORTED A PRIOR

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.123
VERSION WHICH HAD MORE EXPLICIT

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.057
LANGUAGE.

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.592
WERE FREE THAT THE CURRENT

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:13.664
VERSION MIGHT RESULT IN -- MIGHT

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.431
BE TOO VAGUE AND SO WE ACTUALLY

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.632
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EXPLICIT

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:16.967
LANGUAGE ADDED BACK IN FROM

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:19.570
PRIOR BILLS -- SO FOR THAT

00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:22.706

ARE BARRED FROM ENTERING IT.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.735
