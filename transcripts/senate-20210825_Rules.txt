IN ENJOYED MEETING WITH YOU BOTH IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND I THINK A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS WERE. ANSWERED IN THE MEETING BUT I THINK I'D LIKE TO ASK. A COUPLE OF THEM TO PUT THEM JUST TALK ABOUT THEM IN PUBLIC END. OF FOR MS BARRETTO I WOULD START WITH YOU AND YOU SAID IN YOUR PENING STATEMENT. THAT YOU WERE THERE DURING MAJOR CUTS IN DIFFICULT TIMES AND WE TALKED ABOUT A TIME THAT I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE BUDGET ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO WERE THE PRISON SYSTEM DIDN'T EVEN SET UP THE BOOKS OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED UNTIL. SIX MONTHS INTO THE FISCAL YEAR AND IT CAUSED A PROBLEM AND- YOU GAVE ME A GREAT ANSWER ABOUT WHY THAT IS JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN NOW. AND SO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT CURRENT SYSTEMS AND WHAT YOU HAVE ON PUT IN. IN PLACE TO MANAGE THE BUDGET CERTAINLY THANK YOU SENATOR WELL I I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE BUDGET. PROCESS AND WHAT IT LOOKED TO BE IN OUR HISTORY AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND I AM PLEASED TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE NEED CONSIDERABLE STRIDES FROM THOSE TIMES LONG AGO WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TECHNOLOGY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. WE HAVE AN AUTOMATED CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR OUR BUDGET OUT FUNCTIONS. FOR ALL OUR FISCAL FORECASTING PROJECTING- ACCOUNTABILITY OF EXPENDITURES. IT IS COORDINATED FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS OPERATION. EACH INSTITUTION HAS A TRAINED BUDGET ANALYST THEY HAVE A BUSINESS MANAGER. AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THOSE PROJECTS BUT IT COMES WITH A GREAT DEAL OF OVERSIGHT AND REAL TIME AVAILABLE DATA TO US ON EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL SPENDING WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED AVAILABILITY CONTROL IN OUR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS. WHERE WE CAN TURN OFF AND ON LINE ITEMS ESSENTIALLY- AS WE WATCH- EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO HAVE ROUTINE MEETINGS- WE NEED MONTHLY LOOKING AT THOSE EXPENDITURES LOOKING AT ANYTHING THAT'S OF CONCERN. AND WE HAVE- ANNUAL FISCAL REVIEWS AS WELL. SO THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT I'VE BEEN AFFORDED. TO US BY USING TECHNOLOGY GREAT THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE. OF THAT ANSWER AND- AND HEARING FROM IT FROM YOU DIRECTLY IN THE HEARING. AND THEN I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR MISTER MCCUMBER TO FOLLOW UP THE FIRST IS NOW YOU'RE TAKING OVER OPERATIONS AND BEFORE YOU THE WE'RE SORT OF FORMALLY ALL THE WAY IN THIS POSITION THERE WERE MAJOR ISSUES WITH REGARD TO CODE AND THE PRISON SYSTEM COULD YOU SPEAK TO SORT OF HOW YOU HAVE- WORKED WITH THOSE BECAUSE YOU WALK IN AND THEY HAD ALREADY HAPPENED TO SOME OF THE MAJOR ONES HOW'VE YOU ADDRESS THAT HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE SYSTEM IS ADDRESSING IT GOING FOR. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION EARLY ON AND WE DID NOT KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE VIRUSES WE DO NOW WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT ROBUST TESTING PROTOCOLS WE HAVE ROBUST- PP EQUIPMENT- RANGING FROM BASS TO TWO OTHER ITEMS WE'VE ALSO BEEN VERY FORTUNATE WITH VACCINATIONS WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT- OVER A CURSORY POPULATION THAT HAS RECEIVED A CALL BACK SOON ABOUT FIFTY THREE. PERCENT OF OUR STAFF WE'RE WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION RIGHT NOW TO DEAL WITH COLDER THAN WE WERE ORIGINALLY WE'VE ALSO OF COURSE REDUCED OUR POPULATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY TODAY WE STAND JUST OVER NINETY NINE THOUSAND AND BATES- WORD DOWN- WELL OVER TWENTY THOUSAND- INCARCERATED FOLKS FROM WHERE WE STARTED SO I THINK THOSE THOSE ITEMS SPECIFICALLY HELPED US WE'VE ALSO. LEARNED WHICH AREAS OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE- FOR- COOLEY TRANSMISSION WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO MOVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE A HIGHER RISK FOR COLD AND- JUST SAFER HOUSING WAS TYPICALLY MEANS BEHIND US ALL IT'S ALL FRONTS I THINK WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS- AND WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT. WE'VE RECEIVED FROM- EXTERNAL SUCH AS- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE LEGISLATURE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OTHERS- IN GETTING US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND I HAVE TO ASK AN EDGY FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT 53% OF THE STAFF HAD BEEN VACCINATED. WHY ISN'T THAT NUMBER HIGHER WELL WE SAW ENCOURAGE OUR STAFF TO GET BACKSTAGE I MYSELF GOT BACKS IT EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT. AS DO OUR ARE PARTNERS IN HEALTH CARE- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW OF IMPLEMENTING THE LATEST- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER- WHICH DOES REQUIRE VACCINATIONS FOR OUR STAFF TO THEIR WORK IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. ARE INVOLVED AND I TRANSPORTATION OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATIONS THE THINGS LIKE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. AS WELL AS TO OUR FACILITIES THAT HAVE A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE MISSION NOT BEING THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY AND THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WITHIN OUR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY IN CHOWCHILLA. SO WE ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THOSE NUMBERS OF UNVACCINATED STAFF. AND OF COURSE WE'RE CLOSELY. FOLLOWING- THE ANY ANY ADDITIONAL PH KIND SUCCUMBS TO- THE FIZER MAXION OTHER VACCINES ARE GAINING FDA APPROVAL OKAY THANK YOU BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER GO UP AND THEN THE OTHER A QUESTION LAST QUESTION I HAD- HAS TO DO WITH. OF S. B. R. ONE THIRTY TWO AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT SELF IDENTIFY AS- TRANS GENDER NON BINARY OR INTERSEX AND HE YOU KNOW IN IN THE PROCESS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR STAFF ARE WE WENT BACK AND FORTH THERE WERE. ABOUT EIGHT ASSERTIONS MADE THAT WERE NOT TRUE AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE LIFE TO ALL THE SOLUTIONS BY REPEATING THEM BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD IF MAYBE YOU GAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ABOUT THE STATUS OF THIS SAID AND WHERE IT STANDS IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT YES WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING SP ONE THIRTY TWO. WE HAVE FACED. CRITICISMS FROM ADVOCATES ON ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE SOME FILL THAT WE ARE- MOVING TOO SLOWLY AND OTHERS FEEL THAT WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST- WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT HAVE ELECTED. TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT- AN ARTICLE DAIS OF SP ONE THIRTY TWO WERE WERE LOOKING TO CONTRACT WITH- NATIONWIDE EXPERTS ON THIS ISSUE TO HELP US NAVIGATE A COMPLEX ISSUE. I WAS VERYFORTUNATE THIS PAST MONDAY- TO SPEND SOME TIME AT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY WHERE. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN THE TRANSGENDER WOMEN TRANSGENDER MEN- AS WELL AS A CISGENDER POPULATION- TO TALK ABOUT THEIR- CONCERNED WITH SP ONE THIRTY TWO. AND IT WAS REALLY- IT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR ME TO HEAR IT A STRAIGHT FROM THE FROM THE FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY LIVING THIS- DAY TODAY- AND SO AS A DEPARTMENT AS I SAID WE'RE SLOWING DOWN LITTLE BIT WE WANT TO MAKE WE GET THIS RIGHT WE WANTED SURE WERE PROVIDING SAFE HOUSING FOR A POPULATION- IT WE GET WE GET THIS RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MMHM IN A RESERVE THE RIGHT TO COME BACK TO IT IF THERE'S AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT COMPLETES MY QUEST THE SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR. WELL LET ME I CONGRATULATE YOU MR O'CONNOR AND MR AT SHOW- FOR. YOUR NOMINATION OUGHT TO THESE VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS AND I WAS NOTICING FROM YOUR- BIOS THAT FOR COMBINED SERVICE YOU PROVIDED TO. THE- DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION I THINK IF I ADDED IT UP RIGHT CRISIS ABOUT FIFTY TWO YEARS IN IN PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT. YET SHOULD BE REWARDING A FINE MESS WHEN PEOPLE ENTER THE PRISON SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT THEY CAN RE ENTER SOCIETY SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT SERVICE AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO IT HE WOULD HAVE SERVED OUT LONG IF YOU DON'T HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT AND PASSION ABOUT IT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS ON MY GOOD COLLEAGUE ON MENTIONED THOSE REGARDING THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE ON COVERED IN NEWS ARTICLES ACTUALLY REGARDING ON THE TRANSFER OF MANSFIELD FEMALE INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THAT IS GOING AND I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION A MAYBE ON MY ONLY QUESTION ON THE F. WOULD BE ON COULD WE AVOID SOME OF THE OF INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE OR INACCURATE BY ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO ARE TRANSFERRED OF FOR THE NEED- TO BE HAVE THE TRANSFORMATION SURGERY BE HELD IN A SEPARATE AREA SO WE DIDN'T HAVE CONCERNS THAT ARE ACTUAL OR PERHAPS- NOT SO ACCURATE THAT FOMENTED BY FROM WOULD APPEAR TO BE FROM PREVIOUS- YOU KNOW INFORMATION PERHAPS FROM STAFF- TO HEIGHTEN FEAR ABOUT IT AMONGST THE WOMEN POPULATION. SO MY QUESTION IS LAW IT SHOULD BE B. AND SEPARATE. OF FACILITY UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATION SURGERY OTHER ANY CONSIDERATION TO DO THAT ALL TAKE UP FOR A SHOT AT THIS ONE. SO WE EVALUATE HOUSING FOR ALL OF OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION AND EVENTUALLY AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE- FOR SOME HOUSING AND THAT COULD BE SINGLE SO WE'RE DOUBLE SALT- OTHER OF OUR FACILITIES- IT SUCH A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY HAS ROOMS THAT HOLD- YOU KNOW FOUR TO SIX INDIVIDUALS AND WE WERE VIEW OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL CASE FACTORS IN THE CASE FACTORS OF THOSE- INDIVIDUALS THEY MIGHT BE LIVING WEST SO WE DO A CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS ON THAT- AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT. OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS CAN YOU AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE ACT YES BECAUSE I THINK FOR THOSE OF US ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING OUT WHAT SEEM TO BE A VERY GOOD. PROGRAM GIVEN UPDATE THE ISSUES THAT HAD ARISEN AMOUNT OF SEVERAL OF THE INMATES I THINK THEY'RE WHAT TO ENTER SIXTY ONE WHO REQUESTED. OF THEM WHO ARE TRANSGENDER AND REQUESTED TO BE MOVED AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT. SORT OF PROBLEMS THEY WERE YOU KNOW FACING BEING- CONSIDERING THEMSELVES FEMALE AND BEING IN THE MAIL INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD BE N FARRAND OF- AS WE'RE HEARING REPORTS WITH- MAN. COMING INTO THE WOMEN WHO ARE STILL AT ATOMICALLY MAN COMING INTO THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTIONS AND BEING IN THE YOU KNOW THE SHOWERS TOGETHER AND ALL OF THAT SO- IT WILL BE IMPORTANT I THINK GOING FORWARD THAT THAT IS ADDRESSED YEAH AND IT'S ADDRESSED VERY UP FRONT. SO THAT WE AREN'T IN THE POSITION OF LEGISLATORS TO CONTINUALLY DEAL WITH WHAT MAY BE ACCURATE OR INACCURATE INFORMATION- BECAUSE I THINK OUR JOB ESPECIALLY WITH OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IS TO ENSURE THAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THAT WE ARE ALL VERY STRONGLY BEHIND. IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IN OUR FACILITIES BOB YEAH I DID THAT IS THE UP COMMITMENT I THINK MOST OF US WHO ARE HERE AND HAVE BEEN HERE. COMING UP TO THIS POINT IN TIME WANT THAT TO BE. THE MESSAGE- AMMUNITION IN THE MESSAGE ANOTHER. QUESTION I HAVE ON IT NO DETAILS ON THE CLOSE ABOUT IN OUR THAT DURING TIME YOU ARE NOT TO. IN PERSON PROGRAMS GOING ON- AND THAT WAS QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER WE'RE REALLY GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT INDIVIDUAL. WHO ARE INCARCERATED REALLY NEED SO THEY CAN GET ON THE PATH OF RECOVERY AND GET BACK. INTO SOCIETY AND OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO YOU KNOW HAVE A REAL LIFE. SO HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO REINSTITUTE WITH THE VACCINATION PROGRAM REINSTITUTE THE REHABILITATION ALL PROGRAMS IN PERSON TO PERSON AND BEING ABLE TO A FAST. ANALYZE STUFF WHAT PARTICULAR AREA A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE BEST SUITED FOR I'M THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE IN BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE COULD. I USE ABUSE AND WHAT PATH THAT PUT THEM ON UNFORTUNATELY OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT LEVEL FROM ABUSE IN THEIR LIFE AT EVERY LEVEL ON WHO. YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A NURTURING ENVIRONMENT. SO I EIGHT ONE THAT PROVIDES THE EDUCATION THAT THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED BUT CERTAINLY WE FAILED THEM ON THAT FRONT ALSO. WILLGIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE ABLE TO BEGIN THAT PROGRAM AND WHAT IS GOING ON- IN TERMS OF. SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE RESULTS FROM AND. WE HAVE MEASURABLE RESULTS FROM MY QUESTION YES WE ARE- FALL IN WHAT WE CALL A ROADMAP TO REALTY WHICH IS A PHASED APPROACH AS- COLLUDED- CASES INVOLVING ARE INCARCERATED POPULATION GO DOWN- WE INCREASE OUR PROGRAMMING LEVEL SO THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE FACILITIES TAT ARE IN PHASE THREE- ARE ABLE TO RESUME. FULL PROGRAMMING WITH THE CABBIE OUT THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS EDUCATION CLASSROOMS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. AND SO IN THOSE AREAS WE WILL WE WILL ADDRESS THAT BY- HAVING. CLASSES ON DIFFERENT DAYS OF THE WEEK WOULD ALSO- SUBSTITUTE- IN CLASS WORK FOR WHAT WE CALL PACKET PROGRAMMING. I KNOW YOU ALSO REFERENCED. A SUBSTANCE ABUSE- WE DO HAVE A JUST OVER TEN THOUSAND OF OUR POPULATION THAT ARE NOW NOT MEDICATED ASSISTED THERAPY. WE HAVE JUST OVER SIX THOUSAND. ATTENDING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY- TIED TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WE'RE REALLY HOPING TO RESUME- FULL IN PERSON PROGRAMMING TOOL IN PERSON. VISITING IS SOON AS THE GUIDANCE FROM CDPH AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. ALLOW US TO GO BACK TO OUR FULL CAPACITY LEVELS BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS- UNDER TRAINER POPULATION- WINNER WHEN THEY LEAVE OUR FACILITIES ARE PREPARED WITH. THE RIGHT EDUCATION THE RIGHT JOB SKILLS AND- SUBSTANCE. FREE THANK YOU AND I CAN OF FOR THOSE OF US ON THE LEGISLATURE YOU BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME THOSE NO WHEN THEY TO. WELL GOOD NEWS STORIES ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND WHAT WILL REPLACE THOSE RESOURCES ESPECIALLY AND NOT. YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSE- THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT HAS TO BE ON I THINK OF RECTIFIED. IN TERMS OF THE MESSAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE SO. I APPLAUD YOU. HARDLY FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO. THIS PARTICULAR AGENCY AND ITS MISSION- I WILL BE OBTAINING TODAY UNTIL WE HAVE SOME MORE SUBSTANTIVE- REPORTS ON. ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS ESPECIALLY WITH THE SAFETY OF WOMEN AND HOW THEY WERE FEELING HOSPITALS SOME OF THOSE ARE PRETTY GRAPHIC IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. THAT TOO AGAIN KNOW THAT ARE YOU FEEL AFTER READING YOUR RESUME AND SEEING ALL THE YEARS OF SERVICE- VERY VERY IMPRESSED- YEAH DON'T. WILL JUST RESERVE FILED. MY BUILDING MY JUDGMENT OF FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. I'D LIKE TO GO TO MISS BRANDON ALLENTOWN JOB WHAT I NOTICED ON THE ORG CHART HERE MISS BRANDO AND- AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ON AGAIN YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT. WHAT THE TWO OF YOU HAVE DONE. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MISSION. I APPLAUD YOU- BUT I NOTICED THAT UNDER- YOUR ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS BOX MY GOODNESS YOU HAVE. A LOT OF THINGS TO OVERSEE. ABOUT ONE THAT CAUGHT MY EYE WAS HUMAN RESOURCES DEPUTY DIRECTOR IS VACANT UNITS THAT ACCURATE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME BECAUSE- THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME OUT. OF A REALLY ABOUT HUMAN RESOURCES AND WHETHER THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM WITH INMATES AND STAFF AND SOME OF THE WHAT WE CALL THE TOXIC. OF WORK AND LIVING ENVIRONMENT THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT SO IS THAT ACCURATE IN IS THAT FALLING ON YOUR SHOULDERS OR DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE. THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH AT THE MOMENT. TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE THANK YOU SENATE WE DO HAVE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR HUMAN RESOURCE BECAUSE AND IS NOT FILLED AND IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN RESOURCES AND OUR OFFICE OF TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. OUR OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS WE HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE THAT'S BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS TRAINING AND NATIONALS TO ADDRESS B. THE STRESS ENVIRONMENT THAT OR OR PEACE OFFICERS ENCOUNTER IS MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- AS WELL AS ADDRESSING DIVERSITYEQUITY INCLUSION. FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAM THAT HAS A NUMBER OF BUILDING BLOCKS THAT ADDRESSES. WELLNESS IT ADDRESSES UPWARD MOBILITY- THINGS SUCH AS OUR DESERT WATERS THAT PROVIDES- TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF ON THE STRESSORS THAT OCCUR IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT. AND HOW BEST TO COPE AND ADDRESS THOSE WELL AS STRESS RESILIENCY REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE MOVING pCHIP FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A AT A TRAINING THAT WILL REALLY HELP OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WITH- DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES HOW TO DEFUSE POTENTIALLY UNWARRANTED ENCOUNTERS. AND OVERALL WELLNESS FOR THE STAFF ALL OVERSTAFFED IN CORRECTIONS RECEIVE TRAINING ON DIVERSITY. WE'VE ALSO BEEN DOING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT AVENUES BETWEEN HUMAN RESOURCES WELLNESS TRAINING CIVIL RIGHTS TO HAVE A WILL REALLY WELL DEVELOPED WRAPAROUND TRAINING APPROACH FOR STAFF VERY GOOD WILL IF I IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE NEXT QUESTION THE WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TIME WITH THE PRISON BECAUSE PRISON THE CLOSURES THAT JOB PERHAPS THE JOBS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE WILL BE CHALLENGED AND CERTAINLY RECEIVING NEW FOLKS FIVE TO THAT WILL BE BE AN ISSUE I KNOW THE PRISON PRISON CLOSURE ISSUE WILL MOST LIKELY BE ADDRESSED BY ANOTHER ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT TO WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE JOBS THAT ARE THERE ON THE POTENTIAL CLOSURES- ARE AND HOW DO YOU RECRUIT NEW FOLKS WE ON IT YOU ARE BASICALLY LAYING OFF ON EXISTING STAFF BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR REHABILITATION AND THEN ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES BETWEEN. ON. INMATES AND STAFF FIRST OFF THE PRISON CLOSURES WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STAFF AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE LOCATIONS OUR GOAL IS TO HELP ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES FIND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT WITH US. AND AND FORTUNATELY AND IN MANY SITUATIONS THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH OF THE SAME JOB CLASSIFICATION FOR ALL OF THOSE EMPLOYEES IN THE SAME COUNTY. BUT WE DO KNOW HOW THE VACANCY FOR ALL STAFF- OUTSIDE EITHER COUNTIES- UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WOULD THEN MEAN THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS MOVING FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT IT IS OUR GOAL TO HELP THEM WITH- FINDING EMPLOYMENT. WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT WORKING WITH OUR OUR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH THE STAFF. AND I WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE CONSTANTLY RECRUITING FOR VARIOUS POSITIONS OUR DEPARTMENT EXPANDS THE ENTIRE STATE. WE HAVE NEARLY EVERY BARGAINING UNIT WE HAVE NEARLY EVERY TRADING CLASSIFICATION- AND WE ARE OFTEN FACED WITH AT RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES FOR- CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN CERTAIN JOBS. THE WAY WE MITIGATE THAT AS WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST RECRUITMENT TEAM HE TRANSPORTATION HAS TRAINED RECRUITERS WE HAVE RECRUITMENT AS HER HEADQUARTERS AS WELL- WE NEED TO FOCUS RECRUITMENT FOR BOTH PEACE OFFICER AND ON PEACE OFFICER CLASSIFICATIONS. WERE USING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'VE UPDATED ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES WITH HER OR INTERNET WEB PAGES. AND WE ALSO DO A LOT OF FOCUS ON DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT. WE ARE DOING FOCUSED RECRUITMENT FOR VETERANS OR WOMEN. FOR LGBTQ I COMMUNITIES AND REALLY PARTNERING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT DIVERSITY THAT OUR STATE REPRESENTS AND I'M DOING OUR BEST TO RECRUIT FOR ALL OF THOSE VARIOUS CLASSIFICATIONS. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS SHARING THAT- WE ARE. A DEPARTMENT THAT IS ONE THAT SOME POORBEST IS SUPER OF TO AND MOVE AND- REALLY GETTING THAT CONTINUED WORD OUT AS WE HAVE WELL I THINK A- A BOTTOM LINE ON ALL OF THIS IS THE COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON THE PRISONS BEING AN ECONOMIC RESOURCE TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH IN A VERY SENSITIVE. A MANNER- TO UNDERMINE AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF- ECONOMIC WELL BEING IS OF GREAT CONCERN WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE NOTICE AND PLANNING ON A FULL BEAR THAT IN MIND THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY CAREFULLY AND PROBABLY WERE QUITE DISAPPOINTED- ARE BY NOW WITH THE LAST JOB CLOSURE WHICH I GUESS HAS BEEN INTERCEPTED BY. THE LEGAL SYSTEM SO WITH THAT AGAIN THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART FOR ALL YOUR COMMITMENT TO THEIR PHONES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE STARTED WHEN YOU WERE HERE IF YOU ARE SO- BEAUTIFUL FRANKLY SO AND ZERO DOESN'T KNOW DO THE BILL FOR FOLKS WHO ARE UNDER THE PRESSURE OF ONE OF THE SUB.

AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER ANYMORE IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- A DO YOU FIND THE DO YOU FIND A FEWER APPLICANTS THAN YOU DID IN SAY TWENTY NINE NINETEEN AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS WE DID EVERYTHING LAST WEEK- WHEN WE'RE OFF FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ARRIVE THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE WERE AVERAGING ABOUT AND JUST GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE TURN EIGHTY FIVE APPLICATIONS A WEEK. TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE TO TWELVE APPLICANTS A WEEK AND NOW IT'S FORTY APPLICANTS A WEEK FORTY SIX APPLICANTS A WEEK AND MMHM AND OUT OF THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE REQUIREMENTS I THINK THAT YOU WOULD HAVE YOU WOULD LOSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT PERCENTAGE RATE BECAUSE YOU KNOW DRUG TESTING VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE- CRIMINAL HISTORY JUST ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT YOU DO TO BE A CITIES HERE OFFICER. DO YOU- DO YOU FIND YOUR APPLICATION BASE IS LOWER THAN HAS PREVIOUSLY BANNED WELL OUR APPLICATION BASED OUT OVERALL WE'RE IT DEPENDS ON THE CLASSIFICATION- BUT AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO PEACE OFFICER CLASSIFICATIONS- WE DID SEE A SLIGHT DECLINE THIS PAST YEAR- SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN REPORTING- BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT BY DOING ADDITIONAL RECRUITMENT SWEAR PARTNERING WITH DMV AND AB DE. UM AND DOING ADDITIONAL RECRUITMENT WITH THEM- WE'VE GOT SOME BILLBOARD MARKETING MARKETING WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH WE NEED TO ROUTE AND WHAT THE BEST APPROACH IS FOR THE PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION- FOR OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS- WE DO SEE SOME AREAS WHERE WE ARE HAVING AN% INCREASE IN APPLICANTS AND OTHER AREAS THAT WERE HAVING- A DECREASE SIMILAR TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AND- IN THE WORK FORCE OVERALL THANK YOU IN ONCE IS APPLICATION IS APPROVED APPLIES AND WHAT'S THE PROCESS I MEAN I KNOW THAT. AND IS THE CDC ARE HAVE A SIMILAR PROCESS LIKE AND REGULAR OF POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD THEY GO THROUGH SOME TYPE OF ACADEMY CENTIPEDE TRAINING PROGRAMS. LIKE IS THERE A PROCESS AND WHAT'S THE LENGTH OF THAT PROCESS YES WE DO HAVE A PROCESS FOR A LONG% FORCE MAN- POSITIONS- THERE'S A WRITTEN EXAMINATION AND THERE'S A PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST THERE IS SEE. A THOROUGH BACKGROUND A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THOSE COMPONENTS THEN THERE IS ARE AT BASIC CORRECTIONAL OFFICER ACADEMY. FOLLOWED BY- ON SITE- MENTOR SHIP THAT WERE REALLY EXCITED IS STARTING OFF THIS YEAR I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT REGARD- WERE YOU OFFICERS ARRIVED AT THE INSTITUTION AND THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO EIGHT MENTOR THAT CONTINUES WITH THAT TRAINING. TO ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS SO AM. I I'D LIKE TO SWITCH IF I COULD TO MISTER MARK HOMER AT. THE PRONOUNCE THE B. SIR I APOLOGIZE. KAMBER MCCUMBER SORRY I APOLOGIZE AND THANK YOU MISS PERU FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I JUST GOT FROM INSPIRADO HI AYE MY CURIOSITY PIQUED ME THESE WERE NOT IN MY LINE OF QUESTIONS I WAS NOT GOING TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND TELL. AND THE FORMER SECRETARY OF TO SPECIFIC QUESTION WHICH MADE ME THINK ABOUT THIS PROCESS- ONLY BECAUSE IN THE PRIVATE WORLD IT'S KIND LIKE RIGHT UP MY ALLEY IF THAT MAKES SENSE. SO BASED ON ALL THAT IN YOUR RECRUITMENT TIME- SPECIALLY FOR THE PEACE OFFICER PORTION WHICH I'M ASSUMING OR THIS THE- THE GUARDS THIS FOR LAYMAN'S TERM GUARDS. AND PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY DO THAT THE PROTECTION OR THE GUARDS IN THE SYSTEM. AS IT. YOU HAVE SAID EARLIER THAT 53% OF THE STAFF INCLUDING THE GUARDS ARE- VACCINATED OR NOT- VACCINATED THE FORMER SECRETARY. OF WOULD LIKE THAT NUMBER TO BE HIGHER. MY QUESTION IS THAT- AS I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST I GOT PEOPLE CALLING ME LEFT AND RIGHT AND- SEVERAL OF THEM ARE FIREFIGHTERS TEACHERS NURSES AND A LOT OF THEM ARE CDC ARE. THE GUARDS WHAT HAPPENS IF I MEAN. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH BACKUP THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE TRAINING ACADEMY SKILLED TRAINED PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE THAT COULD TAKE THESE POSITIONS IF MANDATES ARE REQUIRED IN YOUR- YOU LOSE STAFF AT FIDELITY SESSION I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU CENTER OKAY TOTALLY FINE I SHOULDN'T SPOKE OVER YOU I APOLOGIZE ON JAN SHOULD THE QUESTION IF OR FACED WITH THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE- INSUFFICIENT STAFF WE HAVE STAFFING PLANS FOR EACH INSTITUTION TO RUN AT REDUCED LEVELS. OF STANDARDS CALLED YOU KNOW FIRST LUNCH PLANS- SO WERE ABLE TO STILL RUN ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO THE POPULATION MEETING THINGS LIKE FEEDING AND HEALTH CARE- SHOWERS AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW VACCINES ARE NOT MANDATORY- THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM- AND SO THERE IS THE ABILITY RIGHT NOW FOR US TO WORK WITHIN THAT- CURRENT- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ORDER BUT WE DO MAINTAIN PLANS ARE PREPARED. SHOULD WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS THE YOU THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW M. I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT A DIGITAL PRISON CLOSERS BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND INDIVIDUALS TO WORK IN THE PRESENTS THAT. AND CHOOSE NOT TO GET VACCINATED SO THAT'S A SEPARATE QUESTION I WAS BEING ASKED THAT QUESTION AND TO LIVE IT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER. DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRISON CLOSURES AND I'M NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT WHO ANSWERS IT EITHER ONE OF YOU CAN TAKE A SHOT AT IT OR BOTH OF YOU- F. M. BASED ON COUNT FROM CAL FIRE TODAY THERE ARE EIGHTEEN FIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THEM HAS AND- CONSUMED OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THE DIXIE FIRE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW MANY FIRE CAMPS AND THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CDCR FIRE TRAINING FACILITIES FIRE CAMPFIRE. WHATEVER IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIRD THE- LEGAL TERM IS CALLED HOW WE START THEIR WHAT'S THE LEGAL TERM FOR FIRE TRAINING FACILITIES FOR YOUTH CONSERVATION CAMPS- ARE IN MAY FIRING CAPS ARE ARE SOME OF THE TERMS WE UTILIZE OKAY SO HOW MANY OF THOSE CONSERVATION CAMPS AND- HAVE CLOSE CENTER OR A FOR CLOSURE SO PROXIMATE LI I THINK A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WE CLOSED I BELIEVE IT WAS A FIVE- FIREFIGHTING CAMPS- DUE TO THE DECLINING ELIGIBLE ON A CAR CITY POPULATION WE WERE STRUGGLING TO GET THE NUMBERS WE ONCE DEAD AND SO WE'RE RUNNING A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF VACANCIES. AS A RESULT OF THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER- THE CAMPS THAT ARE TIED TO THAT FACILITY WILL ALL BE TRANSFERRED TO SIERRA CONSERVATION CENTER SO WE DO NOT PLAN TO CLOSING ANY CABS AS A RESULT OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER CLOSURE IF THAT MAKES SENSE. OKAY M. I. ASSET FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE THERE SO MANY FIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT TIME YOU KNOW OUR FAMILY ALSO HAS RANCH PROPERTY AND I GOT A TEXT FROM MY HUSBAND ONE DAY HE WAS THERE'S A FIRE AT THE RANCH. ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES LATER HE SAID THE RANCHES ON FIRE. AND I LIVE SACRAMENTO AND I WENT THERE WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS REALLY AMAZING TO ME HOW- AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW THE LEGAL TERM FORM AT THE END MAKERS OF THE CREWS THAT CAME FROM CDC ARE WHICH YOU KNOW WHERE THE SHOVEL THE PICK THAT. YOU KNOW THE BREAKING LINE AT NIGHT AND- HOW THEY WORKED SO WELL WITH CAL FIRE IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THERE- AS A COHESIVE TEAM TO ELIMINATE. AND THE FIRE I SAW FIRST HAND HAVE BEEN THERE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE PROPERTY- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE PROPERTY BUT- M. AND THEN I TALKED TO SOME OF THEM OF COURSE I WENT AND START TALKING TO A LOT OF THEM CAN I TALK TO SOME OF THEM AND I ASKED HIM. IF THEY HAD HEARD YOU KNOW WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS CLASS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE HERE THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S BENEFICIAL IN REDUCTION OF SENTENCE TIME AND THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE SKILL SET THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WHEN THEY- LEAVE SO THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY. HAVE SKILLS AND TO HELP THEM STAY OUT OF PRISON AND TO HELP TEM HAVE A JOB TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE IN REALITY THAT'S ALL THEY REALLY WANT TO DO WHEN THEY GET OUT A LOT OF THEM. AND SO THAT WHAT IS WHAT ARE YOU DOING OR WHAT'S THE FACILITIES OR CDC ARE DOING IF THESE TRAINING A CONSERVATION CAMPS. WHICH WOULD GET THESE INDIVIDUALS THE TRAINING- OBVIOUS IT'S HARD WORK BUT TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. AND YOU TO BE ABLE PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO WHAT'S THE SUBSTITUTE IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRAINING TO FIGHT FIRES WHEN WE NEED FIREFIGHTERS OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY'S- ON THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT RESOURCES AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DOES NOT OF FIREFIGHTERS NOT OF ANYTHING THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T PUT IT. YOU KNOW THIS AT THE CONTAINMENT ON THESE FIRES IS STILL LOW WHAT'S THE SUBSTITUTE TRAINING SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T TRYING TO FLIP BURGERS THEY CAN'T RAISE PLAN TO GET RESERVE FAMILY ON THAT. SO WHAT'S THE SUBSTITUTE TRAINING THAT YOU'RE OFFERING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM THEM IF THAT'S A THAT'S A LONG. QUESTION BUT- I WILL BE TO GET THE BEST NOT A GREAT BECAUSE WE WILL I HAVE THE KIND WE ALWAYS WANT TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS ARE REALLY SICK BACK TO THE COMMUNITY YOUR ECLIPSE. WITH THE RESOURCES TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND- YOU KNOW USUALLY THAT MEANS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A GED- WE DO HAVE. A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION NOW ENROLLED AND- COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME PILOT PROGRAMS WERE. WE RECENTLY SAW- ABOUT TEN OF OUR- POPULATION GOD. BA DEGREES FROM CAL STATE LOS ANGELES WHICH WERE VERY PLEASED ABOUT SO WE LOOK TO DO. NOT ONLY EDUCATION BUT WE HAVE- CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. COURSES THAT THEY RUN THE WHOLE GAMBIT COULD BE- AUTO BODY REPAIR OR IT COULD BE AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS- IT COULD BE- THE SUITE OF MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND LEARNING THAT COMPUTER PROCESS. AND SO WE LOOK AT. THE JOBS THAT- GOOD THE PEOPLE IN THE REAL WORLD ARE GOING TO NEED WE TRY TO TARGET- OUR EDUCATION CLASSES. TO LINE UP WITH THOSE DATES OF WHEN THEY WERE LEASE- THEY ACTUALLY HOW RELEASING WITH THE SKILL. I MEAN I KNOW YOU ALSO BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW NOT TRAINING- IS MANY FIREFIGHTERS WHICH ARE OUR CAMP FIVE POLLUTION IS DOWN BUT I DO WANT TO. RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WHICH ACTUALLY ALLOWS- SOME OF OUR OTHER CAR CERTIFIED PLACES. TO ALLOW THEM TO APPLY FOR FIREFIGHTING JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY- SO WE THINK THAT'S A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT'S A VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I AM BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST SAID- WHEN I GO BACK TO THAT THE VACCINE- QUESTION YOU SAID SEVENTY EIGHT. WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING MISTER MCOMMERCE SEVENTY WHAT PERCENT OF THE INMATES ARE VACCINATED. I BELIEVE 74% 74% ALSO- BUT I JUST GET THAT QUESTION I'LL SKIP THAT QUESTION SORRY I'LL SKIP THAT QUESTION M. WELL I REALLY AM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE A AND AN ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW HELP PEOPLE SUCCEED OUTSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT TIME. I THINK THE BEST SOLUTION TO POVERTY IS A JOB AT THE BEST SOLUTION OF PROPERTY BEST SOLUTION TO SELF RESPECT DIGNITY PROVIDING FOR YOUR FAMILY. IS A JOB IN AND MY HUGE CONCERN IS- IS THAT- WITHOUT THIS TRAINING. AS THEY'LL BE MINIMAL JOBS AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WOULD BE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR- EXPLAINED TO ME THAT YOU DO HAVE ADDITIONAL AND TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BOTH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. AND AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE ON THIS- POSITION ESPECIALLY. IN A COPA SITUATION WE HAVE LIMITED YOU KNOW I MEAN BASICALLY YOU JUST HAVE LIMITED FACILITY SPACE. AND YOU KNOW WHEN ROLES GOING TO PLACE ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCE SCENE AND- AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH YOU KNOW ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE- I THINK THAT MIGHT BE VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR US HERE IN THE SENATE. I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED SPACE WE HAD TO. YOU KNOW PUT THINGS IN PLACE SO IT IS- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I THINK YOU GUYS FOR BEING WILLING TO PURSUE. THIS POSITION IN THIS CAREER- IN THESE TROUBLING TIMES ARE TRYING TIMES THAT WE HAVE SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WISH YOU BOTH THE VERY BEST THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW- SENATOR KAMAKA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU I DO LIKE GOING LAUGHED BECAUSE FOLKS ASK FOR MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE LISTED- I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR- SPENDING TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY YESTERDAY TO TALK WITH ME- AND WHAT I THOUGHT WE HAD SOME VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS VERY HONEST WHICH I ALWAYS APPRECIATE AND I HAVE TO SAY TO ECHO- THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR VICE CHAIR. I HAVE INCREDIBLE RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT THAT KIND OF TIME IN YEARS THAT YOU HAVE BOTH COMMITTED- TO THIS PROFESSION AND TO THE SYSTEM- IT HAS YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN HERKY JERKY NESS- OF ALL SORTS AND SO THE FACT THAT YOU ALL HAVE- THEY THE COURSE I THINK SPEAKS VOLUMES- TELL TO THE CHANGE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE- HAPPEN. I ALSO BELIEVE- THAT. BOTH WORK AND THE PUNISHMENT ON THAT NEITHER SHOULD BE- BEREFT OF HUMANITY. OR DIGNITY- AND I THINK OFTENTIMES WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK- IN RULES ARE RELATED TO CDC ARE- POSITIONS IT'S YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND AND HOW TO GET ASSURANCES THAT FOLKS ARE THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO RUN AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED. AND LARGE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE- INSERTING- HUMANITY AND DIGNITY AND BOTH HOUSING PERSUADED FOLKS WHO TREATED BUT THEN ALSO HOW FOLKS ARE TREATED WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING THERE EVERY DAY TO DO THE WORK SO- I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF YOU I'M GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION I THINK BOTH OF YOU ALL CAN ANSWER IT AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER IT BASED ON. YOUR JURISDICTION- AND THE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND I KNOW FOR MISTER MCCUMBER BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM ADMIN TO ADMINISTRATION YOU PROBABLY FROM ADMIN OPERATIONS YOU PROBABLY HAVE- ALL SORTS OF PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU COULD SHARE BUT- I THINK YOU- IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW A AND B. MY FINAL THING. I'M SO THE MISSION STATEMENT FOR CDC ARE WOULD YOU KIND OF NEVER REALLY READ THE MISSION STATEMENT- FOR THESE- DEPARTMENTS BUT I DID- AND I HAD TO COME BACK TO IT BECAUSE EACH OF YOU AND YOUR RESPONSES KIND OF TALKED ABOUT- HOW CULTURE CHANGE. IS HARD AND HOW THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT. REALLY DON'T BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION IN THE REHABILITATION AND CDCR YOU BOTH ALSO MENTIONED THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD COMMITTED PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING AND DOING THEIR BEST IN THE SYSTEM. BUT OF COURSE THAT NUMBER IS NOT A 100% TO BE FAIR THAT NUMBER'S NOT A 100% ANYWHERE- BUT JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU- BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT TRAINING DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT BRIAN RIGHT WITHOUT MODELING- AND YOU BOTH DID TALK ABOUT TRAINING SO JUST WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AGAIN ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DOES THE MISSION CHANGE GET ACTIVATED- WHEN THERE ARE DISSENTERS- THAT ARE IN THEIR RANKS- THAT ARE ON THE GROUND. GIVEN THE REALLY COMPLICATED- AND DANGEROUS TASKS IN SOME INSTANCES THAT YOU ALL- ARE FORCED TO MANAGE- IT'S A SLOW PROCESS I'VE BEEN TOLD- I CAN BE A PAINFUL PROCESS I'M TOLD BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S STILL REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT THE FEDS TELL US WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE. LEGISLATORS TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE AND PROBABLY WITHIN YOUR OWN- YOU KNOW INTERNAL SESSIONS YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CHANGE YOU NEED TO SEE TO KEEP YOUR EMPLOYEES SAFE AND HAPPY- TO RETAIN THEM. TO RECRUIT NEW FOLKS INTO THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HELP TO MAKE THE SYSTEM ACTIVE AND ULTIMATELY- TO DO RIGHT BY WHAT THE CHARGES SO CAN YOU BOTH SORT OF TALK ABOUT IT FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE- HOW YOU. ACTIVATE THE MISSION GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN IT YOU CERTAINLY I CAN START THIS ONE- JEFF BUT- SENATOR YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EACH TIME WE MAKE A CHANGE EACH TIME THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD- THERE ARE THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME STAFF BETTER OR NOT ON ON BOARD. AND THERE WILL ALSO BE STAFF THAT ARE EARLY ADOPTERS AND WHO HELPED US TO MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN RATHER SWIFTLY- WE SEE NOT IN OUR HISTORY WE SEEN THAT IN RECENT HISTORY. I MYSELF HAVE SEEN IT PERSONALLY- I WAS IN THE APARTMENT I'VE BEEN HRE FOR SOME TIME. BUT WAS HERE WHEN WE MADE THE- SWITCH FROM CDC TWO CDC ARE. AND AT THAT TIME- THERE WERE STAFF THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY ON BOARD AND EAGER TO SEE OUR TRANSFORMATION HAPPENED. AND THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE QUITE FRANKLY NOT ON BOARD- WE HAVE STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR MANY YEARS- WE HAVE STAFF THAT SOMETIMES- HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH CHANGE. BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THE MAJORITY OF OUR STAFF ARE EAGER FOR THE ADDITIONAL CHANGES THEY SEE GREAT VALUE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING. IT GIVES THEM A GREAT HOPE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING BY A REHABILITATING THE POPULATION AND HELPING THEM TO SUCCEED. I THINK STAFF ARE REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ALL THE TRAINING AND WELLNESS INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE DOING AND WE CAN SEE THAT BY THEIR SUPPORT BY JOINING S AS AMBASSADORS. FOR OUR GABBERT GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE OF RECENT EQUITY TEAMS THAT ARE EACH INSTITUTION WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED STAFF THAT ARE VOLUNTEERED. TO HELP US IN MUNICH HE WITH THEIR PEERS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH ADVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION. WE CAN SEE IT BY THE AMBASSADOR PROGRAM FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT- MEDICATED ASSISTED THERAPY PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE STAFF. OF OVER A THOUSAND OF THEM NOW. YOUR OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO THE BEST. WAY FOR US TO MAKE A CULTURE SHOCK IS LEADER AND THAT HAPPENING WITH VARIOUS LEADERSHIP TRAININGS WE HAVE A LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED OUT WITH EXPERTS. OUR USING OUR AT UC SYSTEMS AND OUR- COLLEGE SYSTEMS TO HELP US WITH SELECTING VARIOUS TRAININGS AND NOT SPACE. AND ALSO USING THE STAFF THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THAT DAY TO DAY WORK- HAVING THEM ON BOARD WITH WHERE WE'RE HEADED AND COMMUNICATING THAT TO THEIR PEERS. AS LONG AS AS WELL AS HAVING A MESSAGE FROM FROM CENTRAL OFFICE. ANDRIY FACILITY AND I KNEW THE ANSWER OF COURSE WE HAD DONE IN THE LAST YEAR. WHERE AS THE FOLKS THAT MAY HAVE NOT HAD THEIR TURN COME UP TO BE IN EDUCATION SLOT WHO WERE YOU KNOW SPENT THE DAY ARE THE ARE WE WERE HAVING INSTANCE EVERY DAY. SO I LIKE WE HAVE PROGRAMS NUMBER ONE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE POPULATION OF SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE TO DO- WE WANT FOLKS TO WHOM IN THE PAST MAJORITY OF OUR POPULATION RELEASES AT SOME POINT WE WANT THEM TO RELEASE WITH THE TOOLS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE DO NOT WANT FOLKS COMING BACK- WITH THE HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE- YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND CYCLING IN AND OUT OF PRISON OUR JOB SHOULD BE TO FIX THOSE INDIVIDUALS I THINK YOU YOU HAVING A GOOD POINT ABOUT HOW DO YOU GET STAFF TO BUY AND I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. GO TO VALLEY STATE PRISON- THIS PAST MONDAY. AND I TALKED TO SOME INDIVIDUALS IN IN ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS OF ONE OF THE COUNSELORS THAT CORDING SUMMER YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAM AND WERE KIND OF TARGETING- OUR PRIMARY NORWAY MODEL ADDITIONALLY IS AT THAT FACILITY AND I ASKED HIM I SAID. YOU KNOW DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PASSION FOR THIS TO PUSH HOUSTON TO BETTER THEMSELVES AND- UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS TO YOU AND OTHERS ARE THE PROGRAM HE SAID NO I DIDN'T HE SAID I HAD TO GO TO A CLASS AND I SAW WHAT WAS POSSIBLE AND I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SUBSTITUTION I STARTED IMPLEMENTING IT AND IS IT RESULTED IN NOT ONLY. THE INMATE POPULATION DE STRESSING BUT IT ALSO RESULTED IN THE STAFF STRESS LEVEL COMING DOWN WHICH IS PART OF THE KEY COMPONENT OF THE NORWAY MODEL IS NOT JUST ABOUT- THE INCARCERATED POPULATION BUT IT'S HOW THAT'S THE STAFF INTERACT AND- CAN'T CAN DO SO IN A LESS STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT. AND MAYBE MORE FRIENDLY BUT NOT OVER FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE STAFF UNDERSTANDS- THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AS WELL AND WE NEED TO DO A GOOD JOB OF GETTING THAT MESSAGE DOWN TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT WATER DOWN AS IT COMES DOWN FOR MYSELF FOR MISS BROWN. UNTIL IT GETS DOWN TO THAT THE LION CORRECTIONAL OFFICER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MESSAGE- I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T WATER DOWN IS A STRONG MESSAGE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT- STAFF AND WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR- BECAUSE MY NEXT QUESTION KIND OF RELATES TO THAT AND IT'S ABOUT AIMS- THE AIMS PROCESS AND YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING- THE FOLKS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE- IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF A CLUSTER- BUT- THAT'S A PROBLEM. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD- FOR YOU TO HAVE- STALL OUR ALLIES WHEN PEOPLE READ IN THE NEWS ABOUT- YOU KNOW STAFF COMMITTING SUICIDE AROUND SORT OF BULLYING AND INTIMIDATION- BY STAFF- TO OTHER STAFF- IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT ARE HAPPENING- YOU KNOW I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT ONLY OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE INCARCERATED IN THE SAFETY OF THEM- BUT ALSO THE STAFF- AND FOLKS WHO ARE HETEROSEXUAL THERE'S AN UPTICK IN MALE RAPE THAT'S HAPPENING NOT JUST IN OUR PRISONS BUT ALSO IN OUR JAILS AND IT IS REALLY HARD- WHEN STAFF AND FOLKS WERE INCARCERATED FEEL LIKE- A COMPLAINT PROCESS IS NOT REALLY DESIGNED. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TO DE ESCALATE- THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE SO LOTS OF CHALLENGES LOTS OF SHORTFALLS IN YOUR OPINION- FROM EACH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE IMPROVE UPON THE SYSTEM OR I DON'T WANNA SAY SCRAP IT AND DEVELOP A NEW ONE BUT HOW IS THERE. THAT WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ENGENDERS SOME TRUST AND CONFIDENCE FROM ALL OF ITS USERS BECAUSE IF PEOPLE DON'T USE IT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK AND IF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE IT'S SWISS CHEESE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK- AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP IN FRONT OF US AGAIN. AND PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET SALTIER AND SALTIER ABOUT WHY THINGS AREN'T WORKING SO BUT YOU'LL HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME SO I HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS WELL SENATOR- THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR THIS QUESTION YOU BRING UP SOME VALID POINTS- WITH OUR OUR STAFF. FIRST HIT TO TALK ABOUT OUR STAFF. WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. OR ANY DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION OR BOWLING. AND WE HAVE A WELL DEVELOPED SYSTEM OF INFORMING STAFF OF THAT REQUIREMENT THEY'RE TRAINED ON IT ANNUALLY AND SUPERVISORS ARE TRAINED ON THEIR OBLIGATION TO REPORT. AND WE HAVE TRAINED AT ITO COUNSELORS AND COORDINATORS. THROUGHOUT EVERY INSTITUTION. STAFF KNOW WHO THEY ARE THERE'S PICTURE BOARDS AVAILABLE TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE WE CAN GO TO IF YOU'RE ENCOUNTERING ANY OF THE I STAFF MADE AWARE OF HOW THEY CAN FILE WITH THAT APART OR OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING- SO WE DO A LOT A LOT IN THAT AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- STAFF FOR STATE. AS IT RELATES TO AIMS- IT WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS WE ARE FINDING OUT. THERE IS A NUMBER OF AREAS THAT REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT IN THAT SYSTEM WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING SO- WE TOOK AT TOOK AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT WE TOOK AND ALL OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND- INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE AND- AND PLAINTIFFS WITH SOME OF OUR CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. AND I WE'VE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT THAT AND WE STARTED MAKING SOME IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENTS- DOES INCLUDE AT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. IMPLEMENTING ALL ALLEGATIONS MADE BY THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. THAT ARE RELATED TO ANY TYPE OF USE OF FORCE OR PRIA. THEY WILL LEAVE THE INSTITUTION ND GO TO OUR OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS ALLOCATION AND CREAM MANAGEMENT SECTION. THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPORTED- IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT. AND WE ARE GEARING UP TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE- THIS FALL. WE ARE ALSO- IMPLEMENTING A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM. WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR IT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW EACH GRIEVANCE THAT SUBMITTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE INSTITUTION. THAT IT NEEDS TO LEAVE THE INSTITUTION CURFEW AND GO TO A CENTRALIZED INDEPENDENT OFFICE TO EVALUATOR FOR ANY ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. SO THAT IT CAN BE PROPERLY ASSIGNED SO THAT WE CAN TRACK IT SO WE CAN HAVE DATA AND METRICS TO IDENTIFY ANY HOT SPOTS. ARE AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE GOAL OF HAVING THAT EMPLOYMENT AND. BEGINNING AS SOON AS JANUARY OF THIS YEAR D. ARE OUR SOME OF OUR STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING- WE ARE ALSO IMPLEMENTING ANY ALLEGATION OF STAFF ALLEGATION TRACKING SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE BEEN AT A- TECHNOLOGY BASED SOLUTION FIRST HAVE AN AUTOMATED TRACKING SYSTEM. SO START TO FINISH WITH A STAFF MISCONDUCT COMPLAINT WE CAN TRACK- ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO IT. AGAIN FOR US TO HELP US TO BETTER EVALUATE- ANY HOT SPOTS TO EVALUATE ANY TRENDS AND WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF KEEPING THE POPULATION STATE SAFE AND THAT THE STAFF ACCOUNTABLE- NOT ALL OF OUR STAFF MAKE. BAD DECISIONS. BUT WHEN STAFF DO YOU MAKE A BAD DECISION OR VIOLATE A POLICY IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUR REQUIREMENT. AND OUR EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT I DON'T WANT AS WELL I THINK THIS BRIDAL GIVING A GREAT COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER SO I WON'T REPEAT WHAT SHE'S ALREADY SAID BUT- IS FAR AS I WILL ADD A LITTLE CREATE COMPONENTS- WE DO HAVE A ROBUST- STAFF TRAINING PLAN- RELATIVE TO PRE- IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS. ALSO VERY ENCOURAGED ABOUT RECENT FUNDING WE RECEIVED- TO PUT IN NOT ONLY FIX CAMERAS- BUT ALSO A LIVE BODY WORN CAMERAS IT'S SIX INSTITUTIONS WHICH I THINK. WILL DEFINITELY HELP IN THIS ARENA- WE ALSO HAVE A ROBUST AUDITING PROCESS WERE ACTUALLY. OTHER STATES COME CALIFORNIA HONOR ARE PRETTY SO I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS IN PLACE I THINK- WE WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR WAR- CAMERAS THANK THAT IS A BIG PIECE WE DID SEE. DECREASES AND PREA COMPLAINTS WAIT DID- INSTALL CAMERAS AT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY AND SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU BOTH FOR THAT AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU MISTER MCCUMBER BECAUSE IF YOU MENTION THE BODY CAMERAS. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TURNED OFF DURING KEY EXCHANGES I MEAN HOW DOES THAT WORK. D. YEAH BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE IS COMPLAINT DRIVEN THAT'S CORRECT SO. LIKE I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE A JUMP OFF ON MY TURN THE CAMERA OFF YOU KNOW SOUL SOUL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ONE STOP TURN THE CAMERA OFF THEY SHOULD BE STATING THE REASON WHY AND THE STAFF. AT THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED BY WARRING CAMPS OF ALL. RECEIVE TRAINING ON WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TURN A CAMERA OBVIOUSLY THINGS LIKE- USING A RESTROOM- WHILE THEY'RE DOING A HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS. S. KOREA HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS FOR A MEMBER OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION- IF THEY'RE DOING AN UNCLE BODY SEARCH- OVER THE COURSE FOR INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A TIME WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF- IN THE CAR SHOULD POPULATION DOES- WHEN THOSE CAMERAS ARE ON A ROSTER THERE'S A LIGHT THAT SHOWS WHETHER IT'S ON OR NOT AND IT WOULD BE A RED FLAG CLEARLY IF THERE WAS AN INCIDENT. AND THE OFFICER DID NOT HAVE THEIR BODY WORN CAMERA ACTIVATED WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. NOT ONLY WE HAVE THE BODY WORN CAMERAS WE HAVE THE SIX CAMERAS AS WELL. AS HELP GIVE US THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND I- MISTER ADAMANT AND DID WE WANT TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM MAKING BAD DECISIONS. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT BAD DECISIONS HAVE BEEN ALL THE TIME. IT'S JUST A PART OF LIFE- IT TO HOW WE LEARN FROM THEM IS THE THING WHICH I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE ALSO SORT OF THAT SUGGESTING. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BAD DECISIONS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN IT SOME OF THE PREDATORY DECISIONS AND THE REASON WHY I STAY FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE WAS BECAUSE- A FRIEND OF MINE- HIS SON. WAS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER- AND- YOU KNOW IT'S DEEPER THAN HIM NOT FEELING SAFE BECAUSE HE'S NOT WITH US ANYMORE- AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE HE WAS. A YOUNG MAN WITH A FAMILY AND A BRIGHT FUTURE- AND THEN I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS INCARCERATED- WHO WAS RECENTLY SODOMIZED MULTIPLE TIMES JUST IN ONE DAY. AND SO WHILE HE IS- INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF A CRIME HE COMMITTED- HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T NEED TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT AND SO I THINK ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE- WHEN I'M- BEFORE YOU OR ANYONE ELSE ASKING QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO CDCR MY LAST QUESTION IS REALLY FOR MISTER MCCUMBER WE BROUGHT THIS WE CHATTED ABOUT THIS- IN THE CLOSURE OF DJJ I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON- HOW THAT IS GOING- AND ALSO HOW WE CAN BE PARTNERS WITH YOU AND CDCR AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS- IN A WAY THAT IS PRODUCTIVE CONSTRUCTIVE AND ALTERNATELY SUCCESSFUL- BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE ENDEAVOR RIGHT THERE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- YOU DID SHARE THAT THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE. BUT YOU KNOW PLANS ON PAPER ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REAL WORLD AND WE CERTAINLY- WE ALL WANT THIS TO COME OUT OKAY- CAN YOU IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US ABOUT SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND- AND HOW WE CAN BE PARTNERS WITH THIS OF COURSE- WE ARE- ACTIVELY- WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S AND ANSTY PARK AS WELL ON THIS TRANSITION. AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S WE HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT MAY HAVE A FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT IDEAS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT- SKEWS ME THIS TRANSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE- TO HALL WE'RE GOING TO SAFELY AND YOU KNOW FAIRLY GO THROUGH THIS TRANSITION I BELIEVE THE DEADLINE FOR THAT IS JANUARY- THAT WAS REPORT IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH. OF STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW- YOU HAVE NOT ONLY STAFF BUT YOU HAVE THE USE THAT ARE AWARE OF THAT FACILITY IS CLOSING SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THOSE FOLKS AND OUT START WITH STAFF- KNOWING THAT THAT DJJ IS SLATED TO OFFICIALLY CLOSE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. A LOT OF STAFF FOR RIGHT NOW LOOKING FOR THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY- THEY DON'T WANT TO FACE LAYOFFS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AT- THE END OF THE LINE WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING A NEW JOB AND SO. WE'RE SEEING FOLKS BE PROACTIVE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING- SOME CREATIVE OPTIONS TO DO- SOME- EARLY- TRANSFER PROCESSES WERE WILL GUARANTEE A SPOT IN ADULT PRISON- FOUR OF THOSE. CORRECTIONAL OF PEACE OFFICERS WERE LOOKING AT US SOME MORE ON PROCESS FOR OTHER STAFF AT THE DJJ I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY- IS THE YOUTH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. STILL ABLE- THROUGH THE CLOSURE DATE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR THOSE SHOES- THAT WE'RE NOT LOSING. TEACHERS AND- YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE WORK AND I CORRECTIONAL THAT THAT WON'T ALLOW DJJ TO CONTINUE ITS MISSION AND TELL IT CLOSES WE WILL WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO SLOWLY. START LARA NOW POPULATION DOWN- YOU MENTIONED- A CALLING ON THE PLAN YOU MADE I THOUGHT I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD ONE AND THAT PLAN IS GOING TO BE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WE MAY LOSE STAFF AT A RATE THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE OR WE MAY NOT AND SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST. AS WE GO- WE HAVE A RIGHT NOW FOR A DJJ SITES AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO PRODUCING A PLAN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND- OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE- FROM KERN HAD A QUESTION AND SHE SAID SHE WASN'T GOING TO ASK A QUESTION. ABOUT THE COVERT I'M NOT ALSO I'M I SAID THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION THAT WILL BE MY LAST QUESTION BUT I DO JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU- SINCE I KNOW THIS WAS AT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AROUND COVE IT AND VACCINATIONS WERE ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE- AND UP IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK AND THE HEADLINE READS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE DRIVING THE PANDEMIC IN PRISON. SO I HOPE THAT YOU ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO BE SAFE TO GET VACCINATED IF THEY CAN- BECAUSE- YOU ARE IN FACILITIES WHERE THE VENTILATION IS NOT SO HOT WHERE THERE STILL IS CONGREGATE CARE- AND WHERE STAFF ARE AT RISK- AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT- WE'RE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET IN FRONT OF THESE KINDS. OF ARTICLES THAT ARE COMING OUT IN THE NEWS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH OTHER IMPORTANT STUFF TO DO. WE DON'T WANT THAT PROGRESS TO BE DERALED BY ADDITIONAL OUTBREAKS- SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR% TIME AND YOUR SERVICE AND- TODAY AND RULES I WILL BE SUPPORTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR AND- TO ECHO YOU GO IN LAST LAST- IS- REALLY ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS- THAT HAVE BEEN ASK I APPRECIATE SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY.
