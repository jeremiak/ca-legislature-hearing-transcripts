FOR REQUEST IN THIS AUDIT ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE AUDIT RESULTS AS WELL AS THE STATUS OF CHANGES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. BY THE COMMITTEE CHILD CARE COUNCIL OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE STATE HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO HELP PROVIDE QUALITY CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING UP ON THAT COMMITMENT AND ENSURING. THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT HAS INTENDED. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CONTRACTS OF LOCAL ENTITIES. SUCH AS BEFORE SEIZE THE COMMITTEE CHILD CARE COUNCIL. TO PROVIDE CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ALSO PROVIDES OVERSIGHT. IT FORESEES AND SIMILAR ENTITIES THROUGHOUT STATE AND REGARD. TO THESE CONTRACTS. DURING THE AUDIT PERIOD THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAD SEVEN CONTRACTS WITH THE POOR SEIZE THAT COVERED APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CHILDREN. THE AUDIT REPORT WE ARE FOCUSED ON TODAY. LOOKED AT FORESEES EXPENDITURES ITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND ITS ADMINISTRATION OF THE SEVEN CONTRACTS. THE AUDIT REPORT ALSO EXAMINE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S OVERSIGHT OF FORESEES CONTRACTS. THE AUDIT CONCLUDED. THE FORESEES UNFAIRLY DISRUPTIVE CHILD CARE SERVICES FOR SOME FAMILIES. PROVIDED UNREASONABLE DEADLINES FOR FAMILIES TO RESPOND TO IMPORTANT NOTIFICATIONS. THESE INCLUDED NOTIFICATIONS TO TERMINATE THE SERVICES THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE AUDIT ALSO FOUND THAT FORESEES MADE. ON ALLOWABLE. PURCHASES TOTALING OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS. AND IT DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CONTRACTS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN SOME KEY AREAS. NUMBER ONE DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY AND NEED. TO STAFF DEVELOPMENT. THREE PROGRAM SELF EVALUATION. THE FORCE HE'S ALSO ENGAGED IN QUESTION A PRACTICES AND ADMINISTERING AND STATE FUNDED SUPPLEMENT A RETIREMENT PLAN. HE ALSO THE AUDIT ALSO FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DID NOT DETECT SOME OF THE NON COMPLIANCE AT THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND AT THE POOR SEIZE. THE AUDITOR ALSO FOUND A LACK OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S REFUSE. JUST PROCEDURALLY TODAY -- FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS -- ASK THE PANELISTS TODAY KEEP THE PRESENTATIONS TO THE TIMES ALLOCATED THAT'S UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. WILL THEN HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM FORESEES TO MAKE THEIR PRESENTATION. AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PRESENT. THE FOLLOWING EACH PANEL MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WILL THEN -- PRESENT TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT WILL BE [inaudible] THE HOUSE ROSE FOR TODAY. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS A SERVER OUT BELL AS THE I REQUEST HER OF THIS AUDIT WHICH LIKE -- TO MAKING OPENING STATEMENT YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SIR ROTH APPRECIATE DAHLE THE OUR COMMITTEE DOING THIS AUDIT IT WAS SO. QUITE A CONCERN FOR THE COMMUNITY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- THE COMMUNITY CHILDCARE COUNCIL SANTA CLARA COUNTY COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS FORESEES. OF WHICH IS A NONPROFIT COMMITTEE BASED AGENCY. WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND CHILDREN -- IN MY DISTRICT -- TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION IN -- THEY'D MANNER MINISTER TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. CLING APPROXIMATELY FORTY MILLION ANNUALLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I SUBMITTED THIS AUDIT REQUEST. AFTER YEARS OF ALLEGATION REGARDING THE FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT -- ALLEGATIONS ENCLOSURES OF FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTERS RAISE CONCERNS. THE AUDITS FINDING -- SUBSTANTIATES SEVERAL OF THE COMMUNITIES CONCERNED. AND THAT WILL BE WHAT YOU WILL HERE SHORTLY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE AGENCY'S MISMANAGEMENT RESULTED IN FEWER TROLL CHILDCARE SLOTS AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AFTER REVIEWING THE AUDIT FINDINGS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DID A NOTIFICATION TO FORESEES THAT IS CONTRACT WOULD BE NOT RENEWED. BUT THIS DECISION WAS OVERTURNED AFTER APPEAL TO REVIEW PANEL. IT I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S CONTRACTING POLICIES. SPECIFICALLY I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S PRACTICE. OF TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW CONTRACTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PERFORMING POORLY. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZES DEPARTMENT TO RE BID CONTRACTS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE. CHILDREN RECEIVE QUALITY CARE. THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO LOOK FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO IMPROVE THEIR PROCESS AND MOVE. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR SERA WHICH I LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING A RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THERE WE WOULD THEN LIKE TO INVITE THE STATE AUDITOR EARNERS STAFF TO THE TABLE TO OPEN THE THE TESTIMONY. BEFORE YOU START THAT OUGHT -- MADAM CHAIR I DO NEED TO EXCUSE MYSELF I HAVE THREE BILLS THAT AND YOUR PRESENT THIS MORNING AND SO VICE CHAIR ROTH CENTER ROTH WILL BE [inaudible] PRESIDING OVER [inaudible] HEARING [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANKYOU MISTER MURCH HG AND MEMBERS NOW FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL I WILL QUICKLY TURN IT OVER TO STAFF ON MY RIGHT IS LYING ASLEEP LINUS WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. ON MY LEFT IS JOSHUA HOOPER THOUGHT HE WAS THE TEAM LEADER ON THIS PROJECT LEADING THE AUDIT STAFF AND CONDUCTING THE AUDIT. AND THEY WILL GO OVER THREE KEY ISSUES MISTER MURATSUCHI DID A NICE JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE FINDINGS WE HAD IN THE AUDIT REPORT BUT CLEARLY THERE WERE THREE KEY AREAS. THAT WILL GO OVER TODAY ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO DISRUPTED SERVICES FOR FAMILIES -- BECAUSE OF TERMINATION NOTICES WILL GET INTO SPECIFICS MISTER LEE WILL DISCUSS THAT AREA -- ISSUES RELATED TO LATE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS WHICH REALLY CAUSED HARDSHIP AND THEN A DECISION TO END A PRESCHOOL CONTRACT TO AVOID SCRUTINY OF OTHER CONTRACTS. ALSO THAT'S ONE KEY AREA THE NEXT AREA IS CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S OVERSIGHT -- IN FACT NOT DETECTING MANY OF THE MISTER HOOPER WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE TESTING WE DID WITH RESPECT TO EXPENDITURES IN OUR DETERMINATION THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE. NOT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE CONTRACTS -- THE FACT THAT FORESEES WAS NOT COMPLYING WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTING TERMS SUCH AS ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. PROVIDING STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING. AND SELF EVALUATION -- TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION COMMENTS FROM THE BOARD STAFF AND OTHERS IN ACTUALLY FROM PARENTS AS WELL. AND ASSESSING THEIR PROGRAMS SO THAT'S A SECOND AREA THE THIRD AREA MISTER HOOPER AGAIN WILL DISCUSS IS RELATED TO THEIR RETIREMENT PLANS. AND SOME IN OUR VIEW VERY QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT OF THE RETIREMENT PLANS INVESTING FUNDS IN VERY RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES WHICH WAS REALLY NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT. AND THOSE PARTICULAR PLANS THE CREATION OF A SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN -- ONE LOGISTICAL SO WHEN WE ISSUED A REPORT IN APRIL I WAS APRIL FIFTH OF THIS YEAR -- ANY AGENCY THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDER RESPONSE WE PUBLISH THAT IN THE AUDIT REPORT. A BUT WE ALSO FOLLOW UP AT SIXTY DAY SIX MONTHS IN ONE YEAR WE HAVE RECEIVED THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSE -- EARLIER THIS MONTH STAFF HAVE REVIEWED [inaudible] ARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT RESPONSE BOTH FROM FOR SEIZE AND THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE WHEN I'M MISTER LEE AND MR COOPER DISCUSS THE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO EACH OF THE THREE ISSUES THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU. BASICALLY WHAT OUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON THE SIXTY DAY STATUS REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM EACH OF THE TWO ENTITIES. SO WITHOUT MEMBERS ALTERNATE OVER TO MISTER LEE AND HELD DISCUSS THE FIRST ISSUE. RELATED TO DISRUPTED SERVICES FOR FAMILIES. A GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MIGHT IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY I SERVED AS THE PROJECT MANAGER -- NOT A PRINCIPLE ON THE OUT OF THE FOUR SEASONS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- AS BUSINESS HOW MANY KID THE FIRST SET OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN A REPORT ADDRESS FORESEES DISRUPTION OF CHILDCARE SERVICES TO SOME FAMILIES -- SPECIFICALLY A WE FOUND THAT FORESEES GAVE -- THE UNREASONABLE DEADLINES TO FAMILIES FOR RESPONDING TO TERMINATION NOTICES -- THE THE THE TERMINATION NOTICES REFER TO AS THE NOTICE OF ACTION IT'S IT'S A COMMUNICATION METHOD BY WHICH FORESEES COMMUNICATES WITH IT'S FAMILIES REGARDING CHANGES IN SERVICES -- SOME OF THOSE NOTIFICATIONS CAN BE IN THE FORM OF TERMINATION OF SERVICES A REDUCTION IN SERVICES DEPENDING UPON. THE FAMILY'S. INCOME ELIGIBILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. WE FOUND THAT -- FORESEE STAFF HAD INCORRECTLY RECORDED NOTIFICATION DATES WITHIN ITS CHILD CARE DATABASE SYSTEM -- WHICH IS USED TO GENERATE THESE NOTICES -- FOR ABOUT 15% OF THOSE NOTIFIED NOTICES DURING THAT FISCAL YEARS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE PERIOD THAT WE LOOKED OUT. WE FOUND THAT FIFTY BUT OVER 15% HAD BEEN -- ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE REFER TO THE REPORT IS BEING BACKDATED -- THE DATES THAT WERE LISTED AS NOTIFICATION DATES WERE CHANGED TO EARLIER DATES AND THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF CREATING A DEADLINE DATE FOR FAMILIES TO RESPOND TO BE MUCH EARLIER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AS RESULT OF THAT FAMILIES WERE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE NOTICES -- IN A TIMELY MANNER IN SOME CASES FAMILIES WERE ONLY GIVEN A FEW DAYS TO RESPOND INSTEAD OF THE REQUISITE FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN DAYS NINETEEN DAYS BEING FORESEES POLICY IN FOURTEEN DAYS BEING THE STATE'S OF STATE REGULATION FOR NUMBER OF DAYS TO RESPOND. I IN FACT IN SOME CASES WE HAD IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RESEARCH OF THE DATABASE OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED INSTANCES DURING THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH FAMILIES WORSE RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS WITH -- DUE DATES T COLLAPSED AND SO THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY GIVEN A NOTIFICATION THAT THEY COULD RESPOND TO BECAUSE THE TIME THAT ALREADY EXPIRED -- IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE EFFECT WE LOOKED AT CASE FILES FOR A SELECTION OF TEN NOTICES FOR WHICH THE US SERVICES WERE -- SUGGEST TO BE TERMINATED AND WE FOUND IN SOME CASES -- THE SERVICES ENDED UP NOT BEING TERMINATED. CASES IN WHICH SERVICES WERE ACTUALLY TERMINATED -- THUS LEAVING FAMILY WITHOUT SERVICES. WE INQUIRED OF FORESEES AS TO THE REASON WHY THE THE SPECTATING IT OCCURRED IN THE COULD NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THEY'RE STAFF BACKDATED -- THOSE NOTICES NOR COULD THEY PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION AS TO ANY TYPE OF RATIONALE AS TO WHY A DATE WOULD NEED TO BE BACK DATED. OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR FOR SEIZE. TO ESSENTIALLY I ESTABLISH CONTROL WITHIN ITS DATABASE SYSTEM TO PREVENT THE SPECTATING FROM OCCURRING -- FORESEES AGREED WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT AND HAS SINCE IMPLEMENTED THAT CONTROL IN ITS SYSTEM. OUR RECOMMENDATION ALSO -- I DIRECTED. FIVE TO A MONITOR THAT CONTROL -- AND ENSURE THAT THE SPECTATING DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE -- IT AS IT IS IT IS STOCK RESPONDED THAT IT'S GOING TO DO SO AND WE WILL BE UP FOLLOWING UP AT OUR NEXT TURN OVER WILL BE. WHICH WILL BE FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW AT THE SIX MONTH FOLLOW UP RESPONSE PERIOD. ANOTHER A RELATED AYE ISSUE REGARDING -- THE BACKDATING IN THE NOTIFICATIONS IS. ALSO NOTED THAT. THAT -- GIVEN THE HIGH NUMBER OF NOTICES THAT HAD UNREASONABLE RESPONSE PERIODS WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE SEEN FAMILIES APPEAL THE THAT THE PROCESS IN QUESTION THE AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN TO THEM TO RESPOND. WHAT WE ENDED UP FIGHTING AND INCREASE WITH BOTH FOR SEIZE AND EDUCATION BOTH OF WHOM ARE INVOLVED IN THE APPEAL PROCESS? FORESEES FIRST IN EDUCATION. AYE IN BOTH CASES FOR FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THEY REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE ANY -- APPEALS RELATED TO THE ON REASONABLE TIME FRAME SWITCHED WHICH SURPRISED US. WE WE THEN -- LOOKED INTO THE PROCESS SEASON INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING SHARED WITH THE FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- FROM FORESEES PERSPECTIVE WE'VE WE FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THEY DESCRIBE THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS WE DETERMINED THAT. THE DOCUMENTATIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE FAMILIES AYE LACKS DESCRIPTIONS OF INFORMATION SUCH AS THE BALLOT GROUNDS FOR HOW YOU WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TYPE OF APPEAL. WHO YOU WOULD CONTACT THE PROCESS FOR GOING THROUGH THAT -- FROM EDUCATION'S PERSPECTIVE -- WE FOUND THAT EDUCATIONAL THOUGH IT REQUIRED. FOR SEASON OTHER CONTRACTORS -- TO ESTABLISHED APPEAL PROCESS DID NOT SPECIFIC DIRECTION OR PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS AS TO HOW THOSE -- CONTRACTORS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO ABOUT THAT. A SORE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOTH FORESEES AN EDUCATION RELATED TO DEVELOPING THOSE PROPHECIES -- THE COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES AND ENSURING THAT THERE WERE REGULATORY OR A REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH CONTRACTORS NOT ONLY HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY CONTRACTUALLY BUT ALSO FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. BUT FOR SEIZE AGREED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION PERTAIN TO IT DIET IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF OF DEVELOPING -- COMMUNICATION AT THAT HOUSE -- DEVELOPED AT SIXTY DAY RESPONSE AND INFORMED US THAT IT. UNPREPARED AND APPEAL POLICY -- WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT TO BE INCORPORATED WITHIN ITS PROVIDER AND PARENT HANDBOOK. BUT EDUCATION ON THE OTHER HAND DID NOT AGREE WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION -- DATE A EDUCATION BELIEVES THAT IT'S PROCESS -- IN PLACE FOR DIRECTING. CONTRACTORS ABOUT ESTABLISHMENT BILL PROCESSES IS IS OUTLINED IN SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT AND OTHER PROCEDURES THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE OR SUFFICIENT. WE FEEL THAT -- EDUCATION NEEDS TO SPEND A ADDITIONAL ATTENTION IN TERMS OF DEL ABOUT DEVELOPING PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO APPEALS -- RELATED TO THIS VERY SENSITIVE MATTER. AS FAR AS OTHER AREAS RELATED TO A DISRUPTION OF SERVICES WE ALSO NOTED THAT FORESEES PAID SOME CHILDCARE PROVIDERS LATE IN SOME INSTANCES. OF THE CAUSE FOR THAT HAD TO DO WITH A LACK OF A COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION -- WITHIN DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE FORCES ORGANIZATION SO IT A RECOMMENDATION FOR FORESEES -- TO DEVELOP FORMAL POLICIES FOR INTO CHOIR DOCUMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO TO PAY PROVIDERS -- WE WE DETERMINE THIS WAS A SENSITIVE AREA FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT OF PROVIDERS ARE NOT PAID PROMPTLY THERE IS CERTAINLY A RISK THAT OF OF THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES OR INTERMITTENT SERVICES. THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT PARENTS AS WELL BECAUSE OF THEIR NEEDS OF TO SEEK OTHER CHILD CARE. FINALLY WE IDENTIFIED THAT -- FORSEE SAID AND IT'S PRESCHOOL CONTRACT TO AVOID SCRUTINY OF IT -- BY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A RELATED SORTS OTHER CONTRACTS -- EDUCATION AS PART OF ITS MONITORING PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIED CONCERNS HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS OUT SOME OF THE PRESCHOOLS -- AB FORESEES. AND HAD MADE A DECISION TO PLACE THE FORESEES PRESCHOOL CONTRACT UNDER CONDITIONAL STATUS. BY THAT CONDITIONAL STATUS WOULD THEN REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY BY EDUCATION OF FORESEES CONTRACT. STATE LAW ALSO DICTATES THAT -- IF A CONTRACT DISPLACEMENT CONDITIONAL STATUS THAN ALL OTHER CONTRACTS OF THAT CONTRACTOR ALSO TO BE PLACED ON A CONDITIONAL STATUS -- THERE BY -- ESTABLISHING THIS SCRUTINY ACROSS THE BOARD -- IN WRITTEN RESPONSE FORESEES IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND FORM TO EDUCATION THAT IT WAS. GOING TO TERMINATE ITS PRESCHOOL CONTRACT -- IT DID SO TO ESSENTIALLY -- THE ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY FROM THE CONDITIONAL STATUS OF ITS OTHER SIX CONTRACTS -- BUT AS A RESULT OF DOING THAT AGAIN IT IT YET. TERMINATED SERVICES FOR US A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT WERE RELYING ON THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM -- NEVERTHELESS OR EDUCATION -- DESPITE -- THOSE OTHER SIX CONTRACTS NOT BEGUN CONDITIONAL STATUS -- EDUCATION DID INITIATE A PERFORMANCE AUDIT -- OF THOSE SIX CONTRACTS WHICH IS CURRENTLY ONGOING AND AS WAS INFORMED TO US IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. ALSO WITH ADULT TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER HOOPER WILL WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER TWO MAJOR AREAS THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JOSH UBER ON THE TEAM LEAD FOR THIS AUDIT. THOUGHT THE SECOND SET OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT INVOLVE FORESEES FAILURE TO COMPLY. WITH SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF ITS CONTRACTS WITH EDUCATION. FIRST WE FOUND THAT FOR SEIZE YOU STATE GRANT FUNDS FOR ON ALLOWABLE AND QUESTIONABLE PURCHASES. WE LOOKED AT SIXTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOCUSING ON COSTS THAT APPEARED TO BE LESS TYPICAL OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. AND FOUND THAT TWENTY TWO OF THOUGH SIXTY NINE WERE NOT ALLOWABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACTS. THESE COSTS INCLUDED ATTORNEY FEES FOR PRIVATE PRESCHOOL. FOOD FOR BOARD MEETINGS AND PERSONAL AMENITIES. IN ADDITION WE FOUND THE FORCES DO NOT HAVE PROPER DOCUMENTATION. FOR FIFTY SIX STEVE NINE COSTS WE REVIEW. TO ADDRESS THESE FINDINGS WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES SHOULD STRENGTHEN ITS CONTROLS OVER PURCHASING. INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY TO RETAIN SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION FOR IS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION SHOULD RECOVER ANY FUNDS FROM ON ALLOWABLE COSTS FORESEES SHOULD REPAY. IN LOOKING AT OAK EDUCATIONS OVERSIGHT WE FOUND THAT EDUCATION CONDUCTS ANNUAL CONTRACTOR AUDITS BUT EDUCATIONS AUDITS FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE YEARS DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ON ALLOWABLE COSTS. FOR THIS REASON WE RECOMMENDED THAT AFTER EDUCATION. PLEASE THE AUDIT THAT MISTER LEE MENTIONED. THAT IT SHOULD DETERMINE WHETHER IT NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS OVERSIGHT OVER PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING THESE ON ALLOWABLE COSTS. ANOTHER WAY WE FOUND THAT FORESEES WAS NOT COMPLYING WITH THE TERMS OF ITS EDUCATION CONTRACTS IS IN ITS DETERMINATIONS OF ELIGIBILITY. ELEVEN OF THE TWENTY FOUR CASE FILES WE REVIEWED LACKED SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO JUSTIFY FORESEES DETERMINATIONS OF ELIGIBILITY. TO ADDRESS THIS WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES SHOULD DEVELOP FORMAL PROCEDURES FOR ITS ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING A POLICY TO RETAIN THE DOCUMENTATION IT USES TO MAKE ITS ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES SHOULD COMPLY WITH ITS CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS TO IDENTIFY IT STAFF TRAINING NEEDS. AND TO CREATE ORIENTATION AND TRAINING PLANS FOR IT STAFF TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. THIRD WE FOUND THAT FORESEES WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH SOME OF ITS EDUCATION CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ITS SELF EVALUATIONS OF ITS CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THE FORCE HE'S WAS NOT DESCRIBING THE PROCEDURES THAT TOOK DURING THE SELF EVALUATION PROCESS SEPARATELY FOR EACH PROGRAM. AND IT WAS NOT CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTING THAT IT USED FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE BOARD [inaudible] PARENTS STAFF. IN TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS PROGRAMS. AFTER DISCOVERING FORESEES NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ITS EDUCATION CONTRACTS. WE EVALUATED EDUCATIONS DETERMINATIONS OF COMPLIANCE. AND FOUND THAT EDUCATION FOUND COMPLIANCE. IN CONTRAST TO WHAT WE FOUND IN TWO AREAS. FORESEES WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT DOCUMENT JASON. EDUCATION WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SORT PORT DOCUMENTATION THAT USED TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS OF COMPLIANCE SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION SHOULD BEGIN MAINTAINING A RECORD OF THE EVIDENCE IT USES. SPORT IT'S DETERMINATIONS. DURING THIS REVIEW WE ALSO FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THE CONTRACTS REQUIRE FORESEES TO INCLUDE PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS BY ITS BOARD MEMBERS FORESEES DID NOT DO SO. TO ADDRESS THIS WE RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION SHOULD ADOPT MEASURES TO ENSURE ITS CONTRACTORS DEMONSTRATE THE BOARD MEMBERS CONDUCT APPRAISALS OF EACH EDUCATION. AS EDUCATIONS CONTRACTS REQUIRE. IN ITS SIXTY DAY RESPONSE EDUCATION INDICATED THAT IT WOULD NOT IMPLEMENT THIS RECOMMENDATION. IN CONTRAST TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ITS CONTRACTS. EDUCATION CONSIDER DOCUMENTATION THAT FORESEES MADE ITS BOARD AWARE OF THE STATUS OF FORCES CONTRACTS I SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT FORESEES MET THIS REQUIREMENT. HOWEVER THE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED NO INDICATION THAT FORESEES PORT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM'S THE CONTRACTS REQUIRE. EDUCATION AGREES WITH THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO IT IN THE SECTION. AND FOUR SEASONS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IT. THE THIRD SECTION OF OUR REPORT ADDRESSES OUR FINDINGS WITH REGARD FOR SEIZE ADMINISTRATION OF ITS RETIREMENT PLANS. WE FOUND THE FORESEES FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMMITTED FORESEES TO FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF ITS FINANCIAL ADVISER TO PLACE THE FUNDS. FOR ITS PRIMARY AND ITS SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS INTO RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES WITH HIGH WITHDRAWAL CHARGES. THIS RESULTED AND HARDSHIPS FOR ITS EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES. WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES SHOULD MOVE THE FUNDS FOR ITS RETIREMENT PLANS OUT OF THE RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN DO SO WITHOUT INCURRING. ADDITIONAL CHARGES PER FOR BENEFICIARIES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT FORESEES WAS DEFICIENT AND MEETING SEVERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS RETIREMENT PLANS INCLUDING. DISCLOSING THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING FOR ITS PLANTS AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS BENEFICIARIES ACCRUED. WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES SHOULD PROVIDE THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN ITS RETIREMENT BENEFITS STATEMENTS IT'S SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTIONS AND IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT. AND BUT IT SHOULD SUBMIT THESE REPORTS ON TIME WHILE RETAINING DOCUMENTATION BUT IT DID SO. LASTLY WE FOUND THAT FORCES MAY HAVE IMPROPERLY YOU STATE FUNDING TO FIND AT SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN. WE FOUND THAT FORESEES DID NOT CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THIS PLAN FUNDING IT SPORADICALLY AND IN VARYING AMOUNTS. WE FOUND THAT IF THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OPTED INTO THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN. IT WOULD DEFEAT DEPLETE THE FUNDS IN THE PLANNED LEAVING NOTHING FOR OTHER POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES. FOR THIS WE RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION SHOULD REQUIRE FORESEES. TO REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR IMPROPER PAYMENTS OF STATE FUNDS IT MADE TO ITS SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN. FOR SEASON EDUCATION OF BOTH INDICATED THAT THEY AGREE WITH THE RETIREMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SEX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'RE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT -- EXCELLENT REPORT. I RECEIVED COVERED SEVERAL AREAS ME JUST MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR DURING THE STATE AUDIT YOU FOUND THAT THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BACKDATED NOTICES. YES THAT'S THAT'S SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BACKDATED NOTICES. SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SENATOR DIANNE DYSLEXIC SIX SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BACKDATED NOTICES AND FORESEES PROVIDED NO EXPLANATION FOR THE BACKDATING. THAT THAT'S CORRECT WE INQUIRED ABOUT THE THE RATIONAL FOR WHY ONE WOULD GET BACK DAYS -- AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT DID FORESEES IDENTIFY THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE BACKDATING AND INDICATE WHETHER THEY WERE SUPERVISOR ORIEL EMPLOYEES OR SUBORDINATE EMPLOYEES ARE BOTH -- THAT THEY INFORMED US THAT A WHILE DEPARTMENT THE THE THE ORGANIZATION WAS UNDER A DIFFERENT MINISTRATION DURING THAT PERIOD -- WHAT WE WERE INFORMED OF ITS THAT THE THE CURRENT SUPERVISOR OVERSEEING THAT PROCESS INFORMED US THAT THAT PRACTICE WOULD DISCONTINUE BUT DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY CONTEXT AS TO WHO WAS INVOLVED PRIOR TO THAT? DID FORESEES BRIEF YOU IS. TO WHAT INTERNAL CORRECTIVE ACTION SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING DISCIPLINE THAT THE ORGANIZATION EITHER HAD TAKEN OR INTENDED TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED BY YOUR AUDIT ASSUMING. SOMEBODY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE US ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ANY DISCIPLINE ACTION REGARDING EMPLOYEES THEY BASED AND IT'S ACTUALLY INFORMED US THAT MOVING FORWARD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO IT INSTILL THOSE CONTROLS AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WAS OF INFORMED OF WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. WE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOUR ACTIONS BECAUSE THE TERMINATION OF SERVICES OR WHEN YOUR ACTIONS INTERFERE WITH SOMEONE'S APPEAL RIGHTS YOU WHEN YOUR ACTIONS. FAILED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT. TO INFORMATION ABOUT A VARIETY OF THINGS INCLUDING AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES OR THOSE APPEAL RIGHTS THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY SERIOUS. MATTERS AS ARE THE OTHER MATTERS SUCH [inaudible] THAT -- COOPER YOU -- DISCLOSED DURING YOUR PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING HERE AND THE MOST FRANKLY OF RAGES. PIECE OF THIS [inaudible] AUDIT. I HAS TO DO WITH -- AND IT WAS VERY SERIOUS INTEGRITY PROBLEM. AND WHEN YOU BACK DATE THINGS. OR IN THE MILITARY RELEASED CAUGHT PENCIL WHIPPING -- REQUIREMENTS -- TRANSLATED THAT TRANSLATES INTO LINE. IT'S UNINTENTIONAL ACTION THAT IS NOT NEGLIGENCE -- AND CERTAINLY NOT INADVERTENT. YOU KNOW -- OUR CORE VALUES IN THE AIR FORCE WERE INTEGRITY FIRST -- SERVICE BEFORE SELF AND EXCELLENCE IN ALL WE DO -- SOMEBODY YEAR FORGET THE INTEGRITY PEAS. AND SO -- I WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR A DURING THE NEXT PRESENTATION -- AND THE ONE FOLLOWING FROM THE DEPRIVED OF EDUCATION. WHAT ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN? WITH RESPECT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ENGAGED AND AN INTENTIONAL ACT THAT IN LEAST IN SOME CASES AS YOU'VE INDICATED -- RESULT IN A LOSS OF SERVICE. SO I THOUGHT I WILL. TURN THE QUESTIONING OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO UNDOUBTEDLY KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS SUBJECT AND I DO SO COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS SENATE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I I HAD QUESTIONS ON THOSE LINES SO ABOUT THE BACKDATING AND CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN -- MORE FULLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF BACKDATING WHAT WHAT KIND OF REASON WHAT SOMEBODY BACKDATE -- THOSE DOCUMENTS. SIR CERTAINLY -- AT AS WE MENTION IN THE REPORT -- WHILE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH DIRECT EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY FORESEES DID THAT WE WE DID NOTE THAT -- ONE POTENTIAL REASON FOR DOING THAT WAS TO MAKE FOUR SEES AS A CONTRACTOR LOOK MORE COMPLIANT AND MAYBE IT ACTUALLY WAS IF IT WAS BEHIND ON PROCESSING THE NOTICES BY -- USING EARLIER DATES IT MAY -- PRESENT THE IMAGE THAT IT IS -- MORE UP TO DATE THAT IT THAT IT WAS IN TERMS -- RESPONSES FROM FAMILIES THAT THAT IS ONE THING WE MENTION IN THE REPORT -- ASIDE FROM THAT -- THERE MAY BE OTHER MOTIVATIONS THAT WE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET ANY TYPE OF CLARIFICATION ON FORESEES AS TO WHY THEY DID IT. THEY'RE THE FOLKS THAT WE SPOKE WITH WERE FOCUSED MORE ON WHAT TRIP SHORT CORRECTIVE ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD AND SO THEIR FOCUS WAS PRIMARILY ON ADDRESSING THE THE CONTROL WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND ALSO IDENTIFYING THE IMPACT OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAMILIES WERE AFFECTED THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF RESEARCHING THAT TOWARDS THE END OF OUR AUDIT. CAN YOU CAN YOU CALM. IN TERMS OF THE BACKDATING CAN YOU -- TELL US -- HOW THOUSANDS OF BACKDATING DOCUMENTS? WHAT'S THE PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION USED. IN REVIEWING IT DOES -- PROGRAM. AND HOW THEY MISSED THOSE -- BACKDATING. THAT OCCURRED AND THE CORRECTION ACTION YOU'RE RECOMMENDING TO THEM. IT WE WE WE MENTION THE REPORT THAT -- EDUCATIONS OVERSIGHT OF OF FORESEES A IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA BACK DATING WOULD BE VERY LIMITED OF WE HAD THE ABILITY THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR IT AUDITS UNIT TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE ACTUAL DATA IN THE DATA SYSTEM AND AND ESSENTIALLY EXTRACT THIS INFORMATION AND IN PRESENTED AT A AT A HIGH. LEVEL I AS WELL AS BREAKING CORD. I EDUCATION AS PART OF ITS -- COMPLIANCE REVIEWS -- OUR ON SITE AND FOCUS IN ON A NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT AREAS REALLY TO THE PROGRAM BUT WE INQUIRED ABOUT. THE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH -- FINISHES SUCH AS THIS THEY INFORMED US THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE -- IT DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE REVIEW TO BE GOING AT THAT LEVEL OF DEATH THAT WE DID ON OUR ON OUR AUDIT -- AND THEY WOULD THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE FOR WHICH THE CONSULTANT AND STAFF ASSIGNED TO THAT -- ARE OR MORE PROGRAM FOCUSES OPPOSED TO TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED SOON TURNS OF THEIR INTERNAL -- OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS. UM THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE A DEFICIENCY THAT. NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED IS THAT TRUE. I THINK WE WE WE WE LOOKED AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CERTAINLY IF THIS THAT THIS OCCURRED -- HERE AT FOUR SEIZE IT COULD POTENTIALLY OCCUR -- ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE STATE WITH OTHER CONTRACT. TO INFORM THEM OF OUR AS THEY WERE AWARE OF OF THE ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED -- INFORMS US THAT THEY THAT THERE AS PART OF THEIR REVIEW THAT THAT ISN'T PART OF THEIR STANDARD REVIEW ALTHOUGH I WOULD DEFER TO THEM IN TERMS OF YES GUESSING HOW THEY MIGHT. APPROACH THAT [inaudible] WHEN -- THERE WAS TWO OTHER AUDITS OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS CALIFORNIA PART EDUCATION. BEFORE THIS -- ONE RICK WHAT A RELATED TO THIS SUBJECT -- IN THOSE AUDITS THERE WAS -- AGAIN. A CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS AN AD HOC GROUPS -- OR INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. THE IN THOSE ON IT SO -- IN TERMS OF THIS AUDIT. ARE THEY FULLY COMPLYING. WITH THIS AUDIT. OR YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU'RE NOT. FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AREAS THAT THEY'RE NOT. FULLY COMPLYING WITH THIS AUDIT. SO I UNDERSTAND THEM -- A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY -- FORESEES IS INDICATED THAT THEY AGREE WITH EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT AND THEY'RE WORKING ON IT EDUCATION -- GREECE WITH FOUR OUT OF THE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS IN A REPORT -- THE DISAGREE WITH US ARM -- ARE THE ISSUE OF THEY DISAGREE WITH US ON THE ISSUE OF A HAVING BOARD. REVIEW OF ITS SELF EVALUATION PROCESSES AND ON EDUCATION BELIEVES THAT ITS INTERPRETATION OF ITS OWN CONTRACTS IS SUFFICIENT -- AND ABOUT MISTER LEE SPOKE ABOUT THE OTHER. AREA WHERE EDUCATION DISAGREES WITH A RECOMMENDATION CAN YOU. YEAH -- WILL WE WERE WE WERE REFERRING TO THE APPEAL PROCESS I THINK SENATOR BILL THOUGH YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE REFERRING -- TO AREAS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFIED NONCOMPLIANCE ASSOCIATED WITH FORESEES CONTRACT THAT BRADFORD FROM -- WHERE EDUCATIONS REVIEW WAS AND AND THOSE TWO AREAS WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED AROUND ABOUT STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAM SELF EVALUATION BEYONCE WAS MISTER COOPER DESCRIBED THE PROGRAM SELF EVALUATION? THE STAFF DEVELOPMENT WAS THE OTHER AREA FOR WHICH WE DETERRENT WE IDENTIFIED ISSUES RURAL REGARDING STAFF DEVELOPMENT THAT THE APPROPRIATE OUT REGION. LEVEL OF DETAIL -- EDUCATIONS REVIEW TEAM -- REVIEW THAT AREA AND SHERMAN THAT THEY WERE LANCE. NO -- PRACTICALLY EVERY DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE [inaudible] OF CALIFORNIA. THEN MINISTERS CONTRACTS AND THEY HAVE THEY ALL HAVE LIKE SOME. DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT -- TO PROCESS IN PLACE. AND THE CONCERN I HAVE ON THIS IS. BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN REVIEWING OTHER. DEPARTMENTS. HOW DOES THE -- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION OVERSIGHT PROCESS. CONTRACTORS COMPARED TO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] IS -- SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHERE THEY CAN DO IT MORE RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THAT WOULD IMPROVE THEIR OVERSIGHT COME YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO OTHER. DEPARTMENTS -- INTERESTS OF CONTRACTS SO. THEN I HAD ANOTHER AREA WAS THE SUBCONTRACTS. OF THE FOUR CITIES HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE SUBCOMMITTEE OTHER THE VARIOUS CONTRACTORS THAT CONTRACT WITH FORESEES. YEAH WE DID NOT -- WE DO NOT GO DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND I IN OUR REVIEW -- WE FOCUSED ON AS MISTER COOPER DESCRIBED CERTAINLY -- EXPENDITURES THAT WERE PART OF OUR SCOPE -- ADMINISTRATOR EXPENDITURES BUT NOT TO THE CONTRACTORS -- AS FAR AS AS FAR AS COMPARABILITY -- AMONGST OTHER OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS I THINK THAT -- IT CERTAINLY DOES VARY THROUGHOUT THE STATE DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF OF OF OF FOCUS AND EFFORT BY AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY THERE ARE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY STATE AGENCIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE -- TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHEN IT COMES -- TO OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACTS -- FORESEE A EDUCATIONS APPROACH IS. TO IS THAT IS TO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED CONSULTANT THAT OVERSEES THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACTOR GROUP OF CONTRACTORS TYPICALLY REGIONAL -- CONDUCTS A OUR ON SITE VISITS AND IS IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN ITS AND CONSTITUTED XIN WITH THE CONTRACTOR THROUGHOUT. THE DURATION OF THE CONTRACT -- CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE. SITUATIONS WHERE. THE CONSULTANT OR WHOEVER COULD BE OUT THERE MORE FREQUENTLY OR OR A TAKE ON A GREATER LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT -- WE'RE ALSO INFORMED THOUGH THAT THOSE THAT THOSE CONSULTANTS AT EDUCATION ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES ELSEWHERE WITH OTHER CONTRACTS SO. ADMIT SOME OF IT MAY BE A WORKLOAD ISSUE AND IT DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF ETHICISTS TO FOCUS ON OKAY SO. THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT WAS OVERSIGHT. BY SOMEBODY WHO ALSO RECITES OTHER CONTRACTS THAT'S CORRECT -- HOW MANY OTHER CONTRACTS IN THE OVERSEAS HAVE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR I'D I'M NOT AWARE THAT SPECIFICALLY I THINK THE PARTNERS KITCHEN COULD PROVIDE THAT IT'S YOUR THAT INFORMATION. UGH GIVE IT GIVEN THE LIMITED SCOPE OF THE AUDIT -- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE DO YOU DO THE FINDING SUGGESTS THAT -- OR INDICATE THE AGENCY HAS DEFICIENCIES IN OTHER AREAS. OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED. AND DOES THAT EXHIBIT A LONG STANDING. PATTERN OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. A I WOULD SAY THAT -- ALTHOUGH OR OR ON IT WAS FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC AREAS WE CERTAINLY AS PART OF OUR PROCESS -- WE WERE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL CULTURE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION -- IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION AND AND ALL OF THAT -- AS AS YOU MAY BE AWARE IF DIRECTOR OF THAT ORGANIZATION HAD BEEN IN THAT POSITION -- FOR CLOSE TO FORTY YEARS OR MORE HAD -- HAD RETIRED DURING OUR AUDIT FIELDWORK AND SO -- HE WAS REPLACED BY AN INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE RECTOR IS TAKING -- IS IS DEVELOPING -- APPROACHES IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT REPORT OTHER THINGS THAT THAT ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ALSO COVER OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN WITHIN FORESEES A I WOULD DEFER TO THE INTERMIX AFTER ACTOR TO SPEAK OF WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION. CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD -- BE SUMMED IT UP TO CONSIDER WITH HAD OUR SCOPE IN LARGER WE PROBABLY -- WOULD -- LOOK INTO OTHER AREAS RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE EXPENDITURES WHERE WERE WE ARE ASKED LOOKING AT ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES THAT WAS ALL AS A COMPONENT AS WE INDICATED THAT WE LOOKED AT 1% -- BUT CERTAINLY THAT WAS AN AREA WHERE WERE GIVEN WHAT WE FOUND WE THOUGHT WE WE WE COULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT THERE MAY BE CONCERNS ELSEWHERE RELATED TO THAT BUT WITHIN. OUR SCOPE AND TIME FRAME WE FOCUSED ON THE ONES THAT WE REPORTED THE MOST LOW ONE OF THE MOST ALARMING FINDINGS OF WAS AT THE FOR SEEDS IN GAUGING QUESTION ALL MANAGEMENT. OF ITS RETIREMENT PLANS. AND LOOK LIKE THEY WERE UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OKAY. ARM OR PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THE RETIREMENT PLANS. SO HOW HOW -- CONCERNING THIS IS SITUATION HOW MUCH PUBLIC FUNDS. ARE CURRENTLY HELD IN THESE RETIREMENT PLANS CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA. OF THE SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE YEAH. THE WE WE THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD ON THE SIDE IT WAS DETERMINING THE THAT THE PORTION OF FUNDS THAT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC FUNDS WHETHER IT BE STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING OR OTHER -- PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDING -- A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH THE LIMITATION ON RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH -- THE HISTORY OF THE PLANTS WHICH HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO WE CAN'T WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC NUMBER -- PER SE HOWEVER. A WE DO INCLUDE WE MAKE REFERENCE TO BOTH THE PRIMARY PLAN WHICH IS THE A RETIREMENT PLAN THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL EMPLOYEES AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN WHICH MISTER COOPER DESCRIBED AS BEING A A CREATED PLAN THAT BENEFITTED A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- WE DO HAVE I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN AS AS MISTER COOPER INDICATED -- AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE -- IT'S ONLY A FACTOR TO BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF HOW FORESEES MOVES AHEAD. OF THE AUDIT FOUND THAT THE IS THAT IF THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SUCCESSFULLY ENROLLED. IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN. AND HE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND QUESTION I HAVE IS. BASED ON THE HOUSE REVIEW OF OTHER -- STATE FUNDED NON PROFITS OR PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION -- ARE THESE TYPES OF PLANTS CARMEN. AND THOSE THOSE -- PLANS THIS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- ALLOW THOSE PLANS AND OTHER -- OTHER NON PROFITS SAID THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH -- AND DO WE KNOW TO DO TO DATE IF -- FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAS SUCCESSFULLY ENROLLED IN ANY OF THESE PENSION PLANS -- I I WOULD DEFER TO THE CARNAGE CATION REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THIS TYPE OF OF PLAN -- AS FAR AS THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AYE AS OF AS OF THE ISSUANCE OF OUR AUDIT WE DID NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAD AND ROLLED UP THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN. ESSENTIALLY ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS WHO RETIRES TO ENROLL IN THE PLAN -- WITHIN SIX MONTHS -- AS AS YOU SAW BUT WE CLEARLY SAW EVIDENCE OF SO WHERE WE CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS OR WILL THAT ROLE IN THE FUTURE. THE DEPARTMENT OF OUR EDUCATIONS PROCESS -- FOR LOOKING AT CONTRACTS IN RENEWING CONTRACTS. SEEMS RATHER STRANGE PROCESS TO ME -- DO YOU HAVE ANY -- RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THEIR PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND RENEWING. CONTRACTS -- THAT WOULD -- INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND PROCESS -- FOR RENEWING A REVEALING AND RENEWING CONTRACTS -- WITH THE THESE THESE PROGRAMS. ABOUT ME I WOULD SAY THAT -- GIVEN THE THE AREAS THAT WE REPORTED NO REPORT CERTAINLY AS IT PERTAINS TO FORESEES -- THAT THAT EDUCATION FOCUSING ON THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS AS WELL AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF ITS AUDIT ITS ONGOING AUDIT THAT THAT -- WILL BE ISSUED SOON -- IN TERMS OF FOCUSING IN ON THOSE AREAS WHAT WE WHAT WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR REPORT AS IT RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF WAS. TO LOOK AT THE TYPES OF ISSUES IDENTIFIED. IN THOSE AND CONSIDER FACTOR IN THOSE IN AS YOU LOOK AT OTHER CONTRACTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE. SO I THINK THAT THE THAT THOSE TYPES OF FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN -- WHEN IT DOES NOT COME TIME TO LOOK AT A PARTICULAR CONTRACT FOR RENEWAL LOOKING AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THE PROGRAMMATIC AN OPERATIONAL SIDES I THINK A REPORT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF? I DIFFERENT AREAS START TO CALL TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION AS WELL AS EDUCATIONS ATTENTION AND EDUCATION HAS INDICATED THAT IT'S PERFORMANCE AUDIT. IS ALSO COVERING SIMILAR AREAS SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT INFORMATION COULD BE UTILIZED IN TERMS OF THE DECISION PROCESS FOR RENEWAL. WHEN THEY COMPLETE THAT PERFORMANCE OUGHT -- TO WILL -- YOU IN YOUR UPDATING YOUR AUDIT REPORT BACKED -- ANY OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT -- ARE ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION OF YOU AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WILL DO THAT YET YES TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS OVERLAP IN FACT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT. FOR WHICH EDUCATION IS DIRECTLY RESPONDED THAT AS A RESULT OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ON IT. THEY WILL THEN CONSIDER -- WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE BASED ON A RECOMMENDATION SO WE WILL WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT TYPE OF CHANGE? CERTAINLY OF THEIR PERFORMANCE AUDIT ADDRESSED ANYTHING ELSE THE REPORT FOR WHICH FORESEES IS RESPONDING WE WOULD WANT TO FACTOR THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL IN TERMS OF ANY ACTION FOUR SEASONS TAKING AS A RESULT OF THAT ON IT [inaudible] I THINK. SENATOR OF IF I MIGHT ADD. UP COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF COMMENTS RELATED TO THEIR CONTRACT EDUCATIONS OVERSIGHT OF CONTRACTS -- WE DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT THEY DO RELY ON THAT ON INDEPENDENT AUDITS THAT ARE DONE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO LOOKING AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THAT OR I PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE AND BASED ON WHAT WE SAY IN THE REPORT IS A LOT OF TIMES AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR THAT'S HIRED BY. A NONPROFIT IS DOING A VERY HIGH LEVEL REVIEW. OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY DRILL DOWN TO THE SMALLER AMOUNTS LIKE WE IDENTIFY WHAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE DOING. IS LOOKING AT THOSE INDEPENDENT AUDITS AND THEN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO DRILL DOWN DEEPER PART OF A A DETERMINATION WOULD BE. A RISK ASSESSMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE AS MISTER LEE INDICATED THERE WAS A PRESCHOOL CONTRACT THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION INTENDED PUT ON CONDITIONAL STATUS. FORESEES DECIDED TO JUST TERMINATE THEIR CONTRACT TO AVOID THE SCRUTINY THAT THAT MEANT ALL OF THEIR CONTRACT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON CONDITIONAL STATUS WHICH MEANT MORE OVERSIGHT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OR I THINK ANY REASONABLE PERSON THAT RAISES A RED FLAG THERE SOMETHING THAT FORESEES IS CONCERNED ABOUT SO IF I WERE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IF IT WERE OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE'D SAY WE NEED TO GET INTO THIS ENTITY AND REALLY DRILL DOWN AND LOOK DEEPER. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAD. RELATED TO SOME OF THEIR CONTRACT MONITORING AS THEY GO OUT AND THEY LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS AND DETERMINE THEIR RISK THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN TERMINOLOGY. BUT WHEN MY STAFF SAID SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU USED TO REACH THAT DETERMINATION THEY DON'T CAPTURE THAT EVIDENCE NOW THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO IT FOR EVERY SINGLE. ELEMENT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT BUT AT LEAST A SAMPLE OR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTATION SO THAT. AND ID SOMEONE SEPARATE FROM THE REVIEWER CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SAY YES WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE FOR SEIZE OR ANY OTHER NONPROFIT. THAT HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO THOSE TWO THINGS THE THIRD THING THAT -- IS I THINK OF CONCERN IS A PART OF EDUCATION IS AWARE THERE ARE ISSUES WITH FOUR SEATS THEY STARTED THIS AUDIT IN MARCH OF SEVENTEEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA FINISH THIS AUDIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT I WOULD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH PROFILE. VERY CONCERNING ISSUE THAT THEY WOULD GET IN THERE. REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THEIR SCOPE SHOULD BE WHICH THEY HAVE DETERMINE THEIR SCOPE BUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS A LONG TIME -- TO COMPLETE AN AUDIT OUGHT TO GET THE RESULTS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO RENEW WHETHER YOU WANT TO PUT THIS SPENT AND IT THIS CONTRACT ON CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS SO SORT OF THING SO. YEAH IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT DEPARTMENT EDUCATION NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN ITS MONITORING -- IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS TIMELINESS THE DUE DILIGENCE OF DOCUMENTING WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN CERTAINLY DOING MORE RISK ASSESSMENT AND AND DETERMINING WHAT WE WE INTENDED TO PLACE THEM ON CONDITIONAL STATUS FOR THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT THEY DECIDED TO TERMINATE. THAT'S A RED FLAG SO THIS JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FOR YOU SENATOR -- BUT CAN MISTER CHAIRMAN WITHOUT DISTANCE BONTA REQUEST YOUR COMMENTS -- DOES THE DEPARTMENT TIME THERE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. WITH THE CONTRACT RENEWAL PROCESS SO THERE -- LINKED TOGETHER IN SOME WAY. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE CONTRACT AND THEN. MAKE A DECISION ON THE CONTRACT OR IS IT -- OUT OF SYNC YOU SAID IT TOOK EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OR WERE GOT IT WHERE WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO REPORT YET SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT COULD TAKE LONGER -- POSSIBLY THEY MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE SOME OTHER AREAS SO. I WOULD SUGGEST THEY GO PRETTY DEEP INTO THIS [inaudible] ISSUE. BUT THEY'VE ALREADY MADE SOME DECISIONS [inaudible] ABOUT. RENEWING -- GIVING US ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE CONTRACTOR [inaudible] YEAH. THEY HAVEN'T FINISHED THEIR AUDIT. IT'S BEHIND TIME RIGHT. SO WHAT'S A NORMAL TIMELINE FOR THESE KINDS OF STUDIES I MEAN IS IT. USUALLY TAKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS THAT. IS THAT UNUSUAL. YEAH I MEAN AGAIN WE CAN DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT TO TO TO ANSWER THAT THE THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS -- ORDER STANDING WAS THE AUDIT THAT WHAT THAT -- WE REFER TO AS IT IS A STE IT'S A SPECIALLY AS A SPECIAL I REQUEST THAT INTERNALLY REQUESTED ON IT WITH IN EDUCATION AS A RESULT OF CONCERNS. REGARDING THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND SO THAT AUDIT WHO IS IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY RECURRING EVENT EVERY YEAR -- CONTRAST THAT WITH SOME OF THE COMPUTER COMPLIANCE REVIEW WORK THAT IS DONE BY THE PROGRAM STAFF AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS MORE PERIODIC AND OR THE CONTRACT ISSUES WHICH IS WHAT WE REFER TO THAT WE COMPARE TO GUEST. IN OUR REVIEW SO THERE ARE THERE ARE MULTIPLE METHODS IN WHICH A REVIEW TAKES PLACE THE DEPARTMENT AND CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THAT -- BUT YET AS MICHELLE SAID THE THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR NOW IT DOES SEEM LIKE A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR PURPOSES OF OF THE TIMING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH FORCES POINT. APOLOGIZE AND THEN I PROMISE I WILL STOP. SO WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS CONTRACT -- WITH FORESEES THAT WAS AND WHEN WE ISSUED A REPORT IN APRIL DEPARTMENT CATION GAVE NOTICE TO FORESEES THAT THEY WOULD BE. TERMINATING THE CONTRACT AND THEN OF COURSE FORESEES APPEALED WE RECEIVED SOME COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OCCASION -- THAT IT HAD WITH FORESEES BACK IN MAY. SAYING WHERE OFFERING CONDITIONAL STATUS. NOW FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR CONTRACT JULY FIRST EIGHTEEN MOVING FORWARD BUT THERE WOULD BE AN ADDENDUM THAT WOULD CITE THE CONDITIONS WHAT SPECIFICALLY LAY OUT THOSE CONDITIONS. A STAFF JUST GAVE THIS TO ME THIS MORNING TO RECEIVE IT FROM EDUCATION LAST NIGHT. THAT ADDENDUM HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET AND THAT ADDENDUM IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALL OF THE CONDITIONS THAT FORESEES IS SUPPOSED TO MEET TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO CONTRACT WITH. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JULY FIRST IS NEXT WEEK. SO AGAIN ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WE WOULD HAVE IS THERE THERE WAS A DECISION MADE IN MAY MAY FOURTH IS THE DATE OF THIS LETTER. THAT THEY WOULD GO AHEAD AND OFFER CONDITIONAL STATUS WERE PREPARING AN ADDENDUM THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN THE ADDENDUM WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET I ASKED MY STAFF THIS MORNING. EDUCATION HAS INFORMED US AND AGAIN WILL DEFER TO THEM WHEN THEY PRESENT. WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THIS BECAUSE AS I SAID THE END OF THE FISCAL YEARS THE END OF THIS WEEKASO THIS CONTRACT I WOULD ASSUME IS GOING TO GO FORWARD AND CONDITIONAL STATUS? WITHOUT AN ADDENDUM HAVING BEEN COMPLETED AND PRESENTED TO FORESEES WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT. CERTAINLY BECAUSE AS WE CONDUCT OUR FOLLOW UP IN LOOKING AT THE SIX MONTHS WE WOULD WANT TO SEE THIS AND DETERMINE. OKAY WE'LL KIND OF OVERSIGHT ARE YOU INTENDING TO PROVIDE. ON BEHALF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT FORESEES IS MEETING ALL THESE CONDITIONS. FINAL COMMENTS THANK YOU SOME OF THANK YOU SENATOR UP AND FRANKLY WAS HOW I DON'T MIND IF YOU KEEP GOING ON BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- AND BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- TO RESOLVE THIS AUDIT AND I THANK ALL OF YOU -- FOR PREPARING AND PRESENTING IT CONFIRM CONCERNS I KNOW THAT SENATOR BELL AND I AND NUMBER THE COLLEAGUES HAD. A PARENTS BEING UNJUSTLY TERMINATED FROM PROGRAM STATE FUNDS BEING ISSUES PROVIDERS BEING PAID LATE. AND UP A PATTERN OF EITHER NOT. ANSWERING -- QUESTIONS OR NOT SUBMITTING FORMS ON TIME AND THIS IS A TROUBLING TO SAY THE LEAST. AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE SUSPECT CHILDREN BUT THE FAMILIES FAMILIES ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE IN. A ONE OF THOSE EXPENSIVE PLACES TO LIVE AYE IN THE NATION. SO I'M I'M THANKFUL -- THAT THE THE AUDIT OF THE AUDITOR'S OF LETTER OF JOB. IS SHOULDN'T TAKE A STATE OUGHT TO DO THIS BUT THAT'S WHY THIS CAN EXIST BECAUSE SOMETIMES ARE SITUATIONS WHERE. I YOU NEED. TO LOOK. AT LEAST GET SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED [inaudible] I WITH YOUR LAST COMMENTS YOU KNOW -- WITH FOUR SEASONS NEW RECEIVING FOR FUNDING AGAIN AND AS SOUNDS LIKE THIS ADDENDUM -- THAT WAS JEWS LIVE PERSISTS. NOT BEEN SUBMITTED AND CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE S. WHAT THE DENIM SHOULD INCLUDE -- IF. CONSIDERING A CONDITIONAL STATUS. I HAVE STAFF MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME BUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY INTEND TO PUT IN. THE THEY CONDITIONAL Y. AND THEN DOES AUDITOR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE. SEE WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU CAN WATER TO BE. APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE HOT IN THE WORLD BUT I THINK I THANKS HOPEFULLY MUCH OF WHAT WE SUGGESTED IN OUR AUDIT REPORT AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT FORESEES HAS PROPER CONTROLS THAT THERE ISN'T BACKDATING OCCURRING. THAT THEY DO HAVE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE PROVIDERS ARE PAID ON TIME IN SOME CASES PROVIDERS ARE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT REALLY HAS. CAUSED HARDSHIP -- SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO MAKING SURE THAT THEIR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS ARE PROPERLY DOCUMENTED THAT THEY ARE. PROVIDING TRAINING TO THEIR STAFF ORIENTATION WE DIDN'T SEE ORIENTATION PLANS FOR NEW STAFF WHO ARE BEGIN WORKING AT FORESEES. WE WOULD WANT TO SEE -- BOARD MEMBER INPUT FAMILY MEMBER INPUT REALLY BEING CONSIDERED NOW THEY'RE ASSERTING ITS BEING CONSIDERED BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE AND AUDITOR'S SHOW ME I NEED TO SEE THE EVIDENCE. SO A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REPORT I WOULD THINK WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THIS CONDITIONAL -- THIS ADDENDUM THAT THAT LAYS OUT THE CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUING TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDING. AND OTHER THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WAS. TERMINATED I AND I AGREE I I I THINK THAT IT IS ABOUT FLAG THAT -- TO AVOID FURTHER SCRUTINY. I'M YOU KNOW [inaudible] EIGHT DAYS. CERTAINLY HAVE A RIGHT NOT TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES BUT INFERENCES. YOU MADE AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A WELCOMED HIM I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE ANSWERS SOON -- HOW MANY? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FAMILIES -- MORE AFFECTED BY TERMINATION THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM -- SO WE CAN GET YOU THAT NUMBER YEAH GREAT THANK YOU -- AS THE SENDER INDICATED THE MISUSE OF FUNDS AND SOME OF THAT PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON RETIREMENT BOARD IN CITIES SALAS A EXTREMELY TROUBLING -- BUT THAT THE CLIP FIDUCIARY DUTY -- THAT BE HOLD DEAR IN AND THOSE -- POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY -- ANOTHER TIE IN THE THESE ARE RETIREMENT FUNDS THAT HARD WORKING PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY DID THAT ARE ARE ALWAYS DEBATES ON THEM. FOR NGHE PENSIONS AND ALL THAT AND THEN THE QUESTION HOW WE CAN STATE. CAN SURVIVE IN RETIREMENT AND AND LIVE OFF OF IT AND SO TO BE TO MISUSE RETIREMENT FUNDS IN THAT NATURE -- IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING AND THERE THERE WAS INDICATION I THINK I I SOUGHT I THINK BY OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE A LOT OF OF A RECOMMENDATION THE MONEY BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE RESTRICTED FUNDS. INTO A MORE. BEARABLE FUND FOR THOUGH THE WORKERS TERMS SECURITY NINE TO BE THERE FIFTEEN YEARS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT WITHOUT BE IS ALL THAT. HAS NOT BEEN DONE OR DO YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE HAVE YOU HAD ANY WORD ON THAT. GOTTA IN IN -- FORESEES RESPONSE INDICATED THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO ONCE THEY DETERMINE HOW THE PLAN IS GOING TO EVOLVE. OKAY LED THAT WHEN THE DOW WAS IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN WITNESSES SO SOMETIME FOR THEM DIRECT COMPLY WITH THAT -- AND YOU KNOW THE THE BACTERIA TERMINATION NOTICES THOUSANDS OF THEM -- IF WAS. A FEW DOZEN THAT BE ATTRIBUTED TO A CERTAIN EMPLOYEE JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO COVER THEIR PERSONAL TRAXXAS ONE THING. BUT I THINK THIS CLEARLY INDICATES A PATTERN -- AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PATTERN THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT OTHER THERE'S A POLICY. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT EXPLAINING IT I'M IT WOULD BE INTERESTING AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANY OF THE WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING THE DATA ENTRY SPOKEN TO ORIGINS. WELL AS AUDIT. COMMUNICATIONS STRICTLY WITH MORE HIGHER LEVEL. MANAGEMENT SUPERVISOR PHOTO AS IT WAS IT WAS WITH THE MANAGEMENT A SIP AND SUPERVISORS -- IN TERMS OF INQUIRING ABOUT THE PROCESS SEASON THEN EXPLAIN TO US WHAT WHAT THEY DID WHAT THE PROCESS WAS AND AND IN THE CASE OF WHEN WE INQUIRED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE THE CAUSE AND SOURCE WE BY DATE COULD NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON SO THAT SO NO WORKERS RISKS. TALK TO THAT. MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY IT WAS A POLICY IN PLACE OR NOT THAT THEY'RE INSTRUCTED TO DO SOMETHING OF THE OTHER THAT'S THE SIDE THAT WASN'T. THAT WASN'T TO DIE UNDER IS PART OF THE AUDIT THAT'S GREAT I'M. FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN TERMINATION NOTICES SENT AFTER AN APPEAL DATE. AFTER AN APPEAL DATE IMAGINE BEING A FAMILY MEMBER OF A FAMILY IN AFTER AN APPEAL DATE. SHE IS IS JUST STUNNING TO ME I'M. THE L. A THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN CASE SAID THEY BELIEVE THE PILLS PROCESS JUST FINE AND THE WAY THAT NOTICES GIVEN IS FINE THE WAY IT IS. YEAH EITHER THAT THE EDUCATION HAS INFORMED US THAT THAT -- THE CONTRACTS TO THE CONTRACTS WITH THE WITH THE CONTRACTORS INCLUDING FORESEES STIPULATES THAT ABOUT FORESEES ANOTHER CONTRACTORS HOW THE BILL PROCESS IN PLACE AND THAT THEY ENSURE THAT -- FAMILIES ARE NOTIFIED IN ARE INFORMED OF THE PROCESS THE CONCERN WE HAD WAS. YOU KNOW AT IT AS IT MULTI STEP PROCESS FAMILIES GO TO FORESEES FIRST TO TO APPEAL IF THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE WITH THE OUTCOME THEY CAN GO TO EDUCATION -- WE FELT THAT EDUCATION NEEDED TO BE MORE FIRM IN TERMS OF IN INFORMING AND VERIFYING THAT CONTRACTORS WERE DOING THAT IN PLACE THAT HAD SYSTEM IN PLACE THE COMMUNICATION EXISTED THAT -- A CONTACT INFORMATION INCLUDING TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND AND OUTREACH COULD BE DONE IF FAMILIES -- HAD THAT ISSUE THAT NEEDED TO BE PROP FOURTH EDUCATION THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO APPEALS RAISED A RED FLAG IN OUR MIND ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS -- THAT PROCESS CERTAINLY WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND CERTAINLY COULDN'T CAUSE ANY HARM FROM THAT STANDPOINT OF GREATER AWARENESS. I THINK IT THE ACT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER RED FLAGGED THAT REALLY CREATES A PRETTY CLEAR INFERENCE THAT. I THE SYSTEM'S NOT WORKING IF YOU HAVE ZERO APPEALS AND YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES TERMINATED AND EDUCATION WAS LYING ON AN AGENCY THAT'S ALREADY SHOWN THAT IS VIOLATING ITS OWN POLICIES LET ALONE STATE POLICIES. IT. BUT UP TO END SO I BUT I MAYBE. HAVE A DISAGREEMENT EDUCATION AS TO WHETHER THE APPEALS PROCESS IS APPROPRIATE IN THE WAY THAT IT HAS -- THE END. THE THE OTHER ANOTHER AREA THAT I AND YOU AND A REYES CUTTING EDUCATION IS THAT THIS COMPLIANCE BUT NO EVIDENCE OR DOCUMENTATION OF COMPLAINTS I THINK THAT'S STEP LEAN AREA. A A AND I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU THAT CAN YOU SOME TIGHTENING UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M THAT WAY IT IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF DISTRUST US. OF THE REALITY IS THAT A PARTICULAR IS A PLACE TO OVERSIGHT IN OUR OPERATIONS OF THE AGENCY. BEFORE SEIZE OR ANY AGENCY TO OPERATEIN THE WAY THAT THEY CAN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY KNOW THAT THAT THAT -- BECAUSE AGAIN YOU HAVE. MULTI LAYERS MANAGERS SUPERVISORS A PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THAT'S COME TO HIS BEING SPENT RESPONSIBLY. I SOBRE EDUCATION ON TOP OF THAT TO NOT. PRESENT OR OR KEEP DOCUMENTATION AND JUST HAVE AN OPINION -- IT IS JUST IS NOT A MATTER OF WHETHER YOU TRUSTED AGENTS HERE TRUST THE DEPARTMENT IT'S THAT LOOK WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROPER OVERSIGHT HOW WHEN WE HAVE. A TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING SPENT I THINK IT'S EXPECTED OF US. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS IN COMMENTS ICMP SIXTY ONE IS A DISAGREEMENT EDUCATIONS CLAIMED THE INFORMATION ON THIS BILL PROCESS. IS OFFICIALLY AVAILABLE AND THEN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THE TRAINING IS DONE PROPERLY IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY EDUCATIONALLY PARTIAL CONCURS. WITH THE RECOMMENDATION AND I SAW THE FORM THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE APPEAL AND I THINK THAT -- THERE'S DEFINITELY UP DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS OUR FAMILIES AREN'T FOLKS WITH. LEGAL BACKGROUNDS ARE FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR WITH APPEALS PROCESSES -- AND EMAIL JUST GOT ONE SHOT TO APPEAL I NOW I HOPE IS OCCURRING APPROPRIATELY WITH NEW MANAGEMENT -- I THINK THAT THE THAT WE CAN MAKE IT WE WANNA MAKE APPEALS PROCESS IS SIMPLE AND CLEAR AS POSSIBLE FOR THESE FAMILIES THEY MAY LOSE THEIR BILL. AND THAT'S BY WAY OF A PLAY HOW THAT'S WHAT THE PROCESS IS FORCED. TO HEAR IT OUT OF BUT TO NOT GIVE THEM A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL MATA IN IN A WAY THAT'S SIMPLIFIED I THINK I AM IS IS -- UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO I THINK YOU FOR RAISING THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND I'M. ALONE UP UP UP HALL PLAZA BECAUSE I HAD. PRODIGAL ONE FROM LAST LONGER BUT I THINK I JUST WANTED EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO YOU AND TO THE COMMITTEE -- FOR FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE AS WELL. NO PROBLEM THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL. LET'S COOPER SECOND PANEL -- BETTER MONITOR I DON'T MIND IF YOU STAY AT THE TABLE BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHIFT YOU TO THE TWO YOU'RE MY RIGHT YOUR LEFT IF YOU WANT TO STAY OTHERWISE YOU CAN RUN.

GOOD MORNING -- THE FEW THINGS THAT -- THAT WE'VE FALLEN ON THE ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AB PLUS MORE OF THOSE WERE PRESENTED TO US BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WERE THOSE OF THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR DECISION TO PROVIDE US A NOTICE OF ACTION. TO NOT TO RENEW OUR THE CONTRACT. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WITH THAT RESPECT. AT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR MEETING WOULD -- THE CALIFORNIA DID AUDITOR'S EXIT INTERVIEW AS YOU WOULD SAY. WE CONCORD WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE WORK RESOLUTE IN MEETING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CORRECTIONS. AND US SUCH AS PART OF OUR SIXTY DAY RESPONSE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND CORRECTED MOST OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WITH A FEW THINGS TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE OF RETIREMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS PENDING LITIGATION. A LAWSUIT THAT'S BECAUSE THE MORE IMPORTANTLY UP WHEN I CAME IN ONBOARD IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE BOARD. I HAD TO RE EXAMINE THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT IT WAS GOING THROUGH. A MAILING TO THOSE OF HOW IT IS COULD DELIVER. THE SERVICE IS THAT IT HAS FOR THE PAST FORTY FIVE YEARS. ENSURING THAT IT WAS COMPLY WITH ALL THE ITS FUNDS. RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAD FIVE SECTORS OF OF CLIENTS SEC. WE HAD THE CHILDREN [inaudible] THE PARENTS THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. DOT DON'T STAKEHOLDERS AND FUNDERS THAT WE HAVE FROM STATE THE FEDERAL TO COUNTY AND CITY. AND THEN OUR STEP. WITH THAT IN MIND. WE EXAMINE ALL THE THINGS THAT WHERE. WHAT TO WHAT WHAT -- OUTLINED BY THE THE FINDINGS FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS IT DOES THAT WERE PROVIDED. IN IN THE CITIES CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION'S NOTICE OF ACTION FOR US. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THOSE -- OUT [inaudible] THE FINDINGS AND OUR DATA FILE THE PROPER CORRECTIONS. BUT CORRECTIONS IN LINE WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO FULFILLING THOSE THINGS. OTHER EARLIER STATES AS WE HAVE COMMITTED. TO BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SECURE DICKON. TING YOU'D SERVICE FOR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. UP THE FEW THINGS THAT WE NOTICE ON ON JOIN THE FIRST PRESENTATION WAS THERE WAS THE COMMENT OF THE SIX THOUSAND KNOWS OF ACTION. OUT OF TO CLARIFY THAT IN THOSE OF ACTION. CAN BE WITH ANYTHING IT COULD BE A CHANCE OF EMPLOYMENT IT COULD BE A CHANGE OF OUR CHILDREN CHANGE UP HOURS. BOB AND WE DID A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL THE SIX THOUSAND AND A IT WAS ONE OF THOSE A THE RESULT OF THOSE WHO USE WERE PRESENTED. PART OF OUR APPEAL PROCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA PROVOCATION. WE HAVE YET TO PROVIDE THAT. TO THE UP THE STATE AUDITOR'S. IT'S ADDRESSING THOUGH FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF SUCH TODAY. ARE WE WILL PROVIDE THAT NOW IN TERMS OF TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT DOES. IT'S THOUSAND THOSE OF ACTIONS WHERE COMPREHENSIVE BE IDENTIFIED IN DETAIL. AND A SUCH THAT INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED TO THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE EDUCATION THE CLOCK PROVIDE CLARIFICATION ON DOES. GOD KNOWS OF ACTIONS INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED. TO CHILDREN AGING OUT. UP PEOPLE MOVING OUT OF STATE. IN ONE CASE A PARENT WAS INCARCERATED -- IT AND OF MAINLY PEOPLE ARE DECIDING TO MOVE OUT OF TO ANOTHER COUNTY IN A SUCH. BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS OF PROVISIONS FOR CONTRACT FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY. A NEW AND DIFFERENT COUNTY YOU HAVE TO AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE SERVICES A CHILD CARE. FOR THAT COUNTY. SO THOSE ARE THE FEW THINGS THAT -- WE HAVE -- LOOKED INTO DURING THE TIME OF FOLLOW THE AUDIT. IF I MAY PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION -- WE HAVE OUR DATA FROM OUR COLLEAGUES FORMA FROM. IT AND ALSO FROM A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S. THAT. THEY WERE ASKING QUESTIONS. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE -- ITEMS AND FINDINGS. IT IS -- UNFORTUNATE FOR US THAT. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM OUR NEW. WE HAVE GREAT AN EXECUTIVE TEAM UPON MY ARRIVAL. TO BE EXAMINED -- ALL THE SCUTTLED PIES IN THE FINDINGS AS WELL AS THE IMPROVEMENT. BOB DOES THE MECHANISMS ABOUT FOUR SO WE HAVE. WE HAVE -- CREATED THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A DIRECTIVE COMPLIANCE TO LOOK INTO THE WHOLE PROGRAMMATIC ISSUES. OF THAT WE WAS PRESENTED FISCAL. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. AND THE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR PERSONNEL AND OPERATIONS. SO WITH THAT WE ALSO HAVE A LATER -- OF OF BOAT MANAGEMENT. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS. AND SO WHEN QUESTIONS IS ASK ABOUT A PARTICULAR MATTER. THAT WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. WE COULD OF CERTAINLY SAY THAT I MYSELF WAS. INCAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THINGS THAT WERE NOT I'D I WASN'T PRIVY. TO NO WAS I PRESENT DURING THAT TIME. SO A SUCH WE HAVE ALL THESE -- REALIGNMENT OF CO. PRIORITIES AND PERSONNEL AND AS SUCH -- MOST IN MOST CASES DON'T THINK PERSONNEL WERE NOT IN THOSE POSITIONS. TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY AND WITH CERTAIN COMPETENCE. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DONE IS DOCUMENTATION THE RETENTION ANTICS AB EXAMINATION. AND OUT OF DOCUMENTATION. WE WERE -- AWARE THAT IN SOME CASES WE DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTATION. AND AS WE POURED MORE TO THAT WE FILED PARTS OF THOSE DOCUMENTATION. BUT IT WAS ALREADY THAT GOD WAS ALREADY DONE. AND AS WE START LOOKING FOR MORE WHAT WE DID IS WE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT. A DOCUMENT IN A DOCUMENTATION RETENTION PROGRAM TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO A CHECKLIST. GOING THROUGH A EACH SEGMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT PRIOR TO SUCH IN THIS CASE EXPENDITURES. RIGHT TO SOME EXPENDITURES BEING -- CONDUCTED. IT GOES THROUGH A BEVY OF LEASE FOR PERSONNEL AND ULTIMATELY OF MY SIGNATURE OR THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF OUR OPERATIONS PERSONNEL TO APPROVE IT. MEANING THERE'S A VETTING MECHANISM -- BUT WITH SENATOR ROTH I SHARE YOUR COMMENTS IN TERMS OF THE AIRFORCE I TO SPEND. TIME IN THE AIRFORCE AND I HAVE BOTH FOLLOWED THROUGH TO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE AIRFORCE ABOUT INTEGRITY AND GETTING THINGS. PRIOR THOUGHT AFTER SUBSEQUENT MY AIRFORCE CAREER I TO OF HAD THE ESTABLISH MYSELF IN FOLLOWING THROUGH THE THAT THE PREMISE OF INTEGRITY. BY SERVING TWENTY ONE YEARS FBI HAS COUNTERTERRORISM SUPERVISOR. SO I BELIEVE IN AND ESTABLISHING THE INTEGRITY OF ANY ORGANIZATION. AND LIVE PORTS OF WHICH IS THAT HAS TO BE A TAKEN OWNERSHIP FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL. AND THE WE BELIEVE IN MAXIMIZING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT IS ENTRUSTED. TO WE ARE COMMITTED AND RESOLUTE IN THE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS POSSIBILITIES AND THE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT FOR EVERY NOT JUST FOR THE FISCAL DEPARTMENT. BUT FOR EVERY PERSON AN EMPLOYEE IN THIS APARTMENT. I AM COMMITTED AS LONG AS A TEAM AND ORGANIZATION AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMMITTED IN MOVING FORWARD. IN IDENTIFYING AS MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CORRECT. THROUGH THE HELP OF THE STATE THOUGHT UP -- DEPARTMENT EDUCATION TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THOUGH. OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THE CA.GOV CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S WE ARE COMMITTED. TO DO THAT AND A SUCH A WE WE FEEL THAT THE OPPORTUNITY NOW EXIST FOR US TO CONTINUE. THE SERVICE BECAUSE WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE SERVICE OF THE CHILDREN. THAT IS WHAT THIS TANTAMOUNT TO EXPULSION WE HAVE TAKEN OWNERSHIP OF THAT MISSION. AND THAT MISSION IS EMBEDDED WITH US IN TERMS OF YES WE RECOGNIZE WE HAVE ALL THESE COMPLIANCE ISSUES. WHAT DO WE DO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND CORRECTIVE? ENSURING THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND WITH WITH. WITH THE THINK AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE COMPLIANCE. WE ARE CONTINUALLY IMPROVING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE ARE COMMITTED. IN DOING SO. BUT IT TURNED OUT [inaudible] TO I COLLEAGUES -- BUILDING ON WHAT OUR INTERIM MANAGING DIRECTOR HAS -- DISCUSSED -- THE BACKGROUND OF FOR SEE IS THAT THE AGENCY STARTED -- WITH ONLY A BUDGET OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THREE EMPLOYEES BACK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE PRIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR WAS ONE OF THOSE THREE EMPLOYEES AND CONTINUED THROUGH UP UNTIL LAST YEAR -- IN. BUILDING THE ORGANIZATION I FORESEE. WAS GREAT AT EXPANDING THE AMOUNT OF CARE THAT WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY HOWEVER I WHEN YOU GROW FROM SUCH A SMALL ORGANIZATION TO A ORGANIZATION OF A HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS AND A BUDGET OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT REQUIRED GROWS EXPONENTIALLY AND THAT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT WAS NOT BEING MET -- THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT HAS CREATED AN EXECUTIVE TEAM WHICH INCLUDES -- MISTER MANNERING AT THE TOP -- DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE A DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS A CFO AND THEN THEY ARE PROVIDED OVERSIGHT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE BORDER DIRECTORS INCLUDES NOT ONLY STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO -- LOCAL ATTORNEY -- STAFF MEMBER FROM SENATE A FACULTY MEMBER FROM SAN JOSE STATE [inaudible] IT'S NOW. WE BELIEVE FORESEES MANAGEMENT IS IN A POSITION TO BE MUCH MORE PROFESSIONAL IZED -- A COMPLIANT WITH [inaudible] THE BY. REGULATORY AND CONTRACTING ISSUES -- DOT HAVE BECOME APPARENT. NOW TO ADDRESS CERTAIN SPECIFIC ISSUES. FIRST OF ALL OTHER MEANT CURRENT MANAGEMENT OF FORESEES IS -- HOLDS ALL THE SAME CONCERNS IF NOT IN GREATER REGARD. REGARDING THE BACKDATING AND THE BACKDATING OF NOTICES OF ACTION IS OF CHIEF AND PARAMOUNT CONCERN. TO EVERYONE AT FOUR C. CURRENTLY. I IN RESPONDING THEIR TO FORESEE HAS CONTACTED IT SIDE. I KNOW WHO WHICH IS A DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT PROVIDER AND THE SYSTEM BY WHICH THESE NOTICES OF ACTION ARE GENERATED. I AM KNOW HO ON ITS BACK AND HAS LOCKED THE FIELD FOR THE DAY. SO THERE IS NO ABILITY BY ANY EMPLOYEE AT FOUR C. CURRENTLY TO BACKDATE A NOTICE OF ACTION. ADDITIONALLY FOR C. HAS. MADE IT POLICY THAT ANY EMPLOYEE WHO IS GOING TO BE BACKDATING. IS GOING [inaudible] TO FACE -- SOME MANNER OF CORRECTIVE ACTION IF NOT TERMINATION -- IN REVIEWING THE PRIOR BACKDATING IT IS. FORESEES CONCLUDED. THAT ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN BACKDATING NOTICES OF ACTION ARE NO LONGER EMPLOYED AT FORESEE [inaudible] FURTHERMORE. OF THE SIX THOUSAND NOTICES FORESEE IS INQUIRED WITH NO. THE GENERATOR REPORT OF EVERY SINGLE ONE IN EVERY FEW THOSE THOROUGHLY. THEY'VE DETERMINED THAT OF THOSE. TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT WERE NOTICES OF TERMINATION [inaudible] HOWEVER -- A NUMBER OF THEM WERE. THOSE REQUESTED BY THE PARENTS THOSE OF PAGE OUT AND THOSE -- PARENTS MOVING OR RE CERTIFICATION. DESPITE THIS THERE STILL REMAINED. I SITUATIONS WHERE PARENTS WOULD NEED TO BE PROVIDED THE FULL OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL. AND THAT HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY FOR C. AND FOUR C. SEEKING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT A SINGLE PARENT IS GIVEN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROVIDE THEIR APPEAL EVER AGAIN. I IN REGARDS. TO AS MR MANNERINGSAID IN REGARDS [inaudible] TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE. I EXPENSES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE -- THERE HAVE BEEN NEW PROCEDURES THAT ARE REQUIRING. EVERY PIECE OF DOCUMENTATION. TO BE PROVIDED AND MAINTAINED AT FOUR SEE -- AND SIGNED OFF ON BY THEIR MANAGEMENT BEFORE THOSE EXPENSES ARE UNDERTAKING. AND THOSE CHECK LISTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE JAIL LACK. SO THAT THEY CAN SEE AND PROVIDE THEIR FURTHER COMMENT ON HOW. WELL THOSE PROCEDURES ARE MEETING WHAT THEY BELIEVE FOR THE INADEQUACIES THAT FORCE HE PREVIOUSLY HAD [inaudible] LASTLY -- TO DISCUSS THE RETIREMENT PROGRAMS I FOUR SEED PREVIOUSLY ENTRUSTED. A FINANCIAL ADVISER TO PROVIDE IT. THE BEST ADVICE POSSIBLE. TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT ADVICE WAS NOT. AS GOOD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN FORESEE IS NOW SEEKING TO MOVE THOSE RETIREMENT PROGRAMS INTO AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE. CURRENTLY HOWEVER THERE IS A LAWSUIT UNDER THE ORISSA -- BASED ON THOSE VERY SAME CONCERNS. FOUR SEED DOES NOT. IS CURRENTLY LOOKING TO DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN MOVE THE RETIREMENT PROGRAMS OUT OF THE RESTRICTED SECURITIES [inaudible] IN -- TWO A MORE TRADITIONAL FOR ONE QUE TYPE PLAN THAT CAN BE ACCESSED WITHOUT. RESTRICTION BY THE BY ITS EMPLOYEES -- FOR SEE BELIEVES THAT THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FEE TO THE EMPLOYEES -- AND BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT. OF FUNDING MECHANISM THROUGH ITS -- THE FORFEITURE FUND -- FROM. NON VESTED EMPLOYEES. I WHO HAVE LEFT THE COMPANY -- HOWEVER. FOR C. YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS. EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COUNSEL -- AND DOES NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO UNILATERALLY. MOVE WITHOUT IN PLACE FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES THEIR POLICE COUNCIL AND ADVICE FROM THEIR OWN EXPERT ATTORNEYS ON THE MATTER -- FOR C. ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. BY THE TIME SET FOR OCTOBER BY. THE J. LACK [inaudible] LASTLY -- FORESEES CONTINUED FUNDING IS TO BE. PREMISED ON AN ADDENDUM OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACTING TURN. FOR C. LOOKS FORWARD TO RECEIVE IN THOSE. AND IS COMMITTED. TO ARE IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THOSE TERMS IN COMPLYING WITH THEM TO THE FULL EXTENT. ONCE THEY ARE PROVIDED LASTLY. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE TEAM. OF FOUR C. IS COMMITTED FULLY TO PROVIDING THE BEST LEVEL. OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY AND IS LOOKING TO MAKE SURE AT THAT. FORESEE CONTINUES [inaudible] TO MAINTAIN [inaudible] IT'S CARE -- THAT IT'S PROVIDED SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND HAS MADE. GREAT STRIDES IN THE LAST -- HALF OF THE YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THOSE NEW. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. TWO MORE PROFESSIONAL ICE ORGANIZATION [inaudible] AND COMPLY WITH THE STRIP THIS LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE IN OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU SO DOES FOR MAKING IT CLEAR SO IT'S IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY THAT NONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INVOLVED AND THE BACKDATING INCIDENTS THIS THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SITUATIONS ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY THE ORGANIZATION. TO THE EXTENT. THAT WEEKEND. APPROPRIATELY AND ACCURATELY JUSTIFY THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE [inaudible] THEY'RE GONE [inaudible] OKAY SO. WE WE KNOW MOST OF THEM ARE GONE AND MAYBE ALL OF THEM. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS. IN MY EXPERIENCE [inaudible] INTEGRITY DEFICIENCIES CAN BE INFECTIOUS WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. YOU'VE ESTABLISHED A CREATED A DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE POSITION. YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED DISCIPLINARY RULES PRESUMABLY THE PROHIBIT. PACIFIC CONDUCT BACKDATING -- YOU HAVE ENSURE THAT YOUR SYSTEMS ARE AS FOOL PROOF I SUPPOSE YOU CAN MAKE A SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO BEING ABLE TO GO BACK IN AND BACKDATERS CHANGE SHOULD DATE IN OTHER WORDS. ENGAGE IN CONDUCT THAT. MOST WOULD CONSIDER MISCONDUCT. WHAT ACTIONS HAVE YOU TAKEN OR ARE YOU PLANNING TO TAKE? TO INFLUENCE THE OVERALL CULTURE IN THE ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE THAT AS YOU TESTIFIED AND I SPOKE. INTEGRITY IS A PRIORITY WITHIN YOUR BECAUSE THAT'S A CULTURE SHIFT [inaudible] AND IT. TAKES MORE THAN A DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE AND IT TAKES MORE THAN. PUTTING ANOTHER SENTENCE IN YOUR DISCIPLINARY POLICY TO PROHIBIT SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD ALREADY KNOW [inaudible] IS INAPPROPRIATE. THOUGH THAT'S A QUESTION THE THINKCENTRE. CONTINUING ON THE TRADITION AND EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD AN AIRFORCE LIKE YOU HAD. ONE THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED THE AIRFORCE IS. TEAM THAT WE HAVE THE SOLDIERS THAT WE HAVE THE OFFICERS SHARED THE SAME MISSION AND TAKE OWNERSHIP THAT MISSION. IN MANY RESPECTS WE'VE HAD THE MY OWN ACCORD AYE DIPLOMAT AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF MECHANISMS. TO INSTILL THAT. I GO AROUND TO COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE EVERY DAY. MY PREDECESSORS DID NOT. I SHARE THE MOTIVATION. AND THE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS I'VE LEARNED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY CAN IMPROVE WORK SMARTER NOT HARDER. THE OTHER THE THE OTHER PLATFORM I DID WAS TO INSTILL IN THEM THAT THEY ARE THEY'RE THEY'RE QUALIFIED AND DEDICATED. BUT THERE S. A RECOGNITION MECHANISM IN THERE THAT WAS ABSENT. FURTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS YES SIR THAT WAS THAT WAS THE OTHER. THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE WE'VE STARTED WAS A WEB IN OUR FOR SCHOOL VISORS AND MANAGERS TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT SKILLS IN TERMS OF MANAGING PERSONNEL HI MANAGEMENT. DOCUMENTARY DOT RETENTION. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT THEY ARE THERE TO LEAD. I ALWAYS USE THIS CONSULTATION MANAGERS KNOW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THEY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS BASED ON THAT. LEADERS ON A HANNAH OF THE HAND THAT I'VE LEARNED IN THE AIRFORCE. THEY UNDERSTAND THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. SO. AS WE GO IN TRAINING WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT SO MUCH TRAINING IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T IT WASN'T LIMITED TO THOSE IN THE STAFF. IT WENT BEYOND THAT. WE STARTING GAUGING THE PROVIDERS GETTING THEM SO INPUT. WE STARTED OUT WE HAVE THE EARLY HEAD START POLICY COUNCIL WHICH A UNDERSTOOD THAT NOW DO ROLES ARE MORE INTEGRATED IN TERMS IN TERMS OF PROVIDING MORE INPUT THAT CAN BE. AB WHAT OF THIS WE WANT THAT CAN YOU DO THIS CAN YOU WORK THAT OUT DID YOU HAVE WAS THERE EVIDENCE BEFORE THAT THERE WERE -- EMPLOYEES WHO WERE QUESTIONING THE BACK DATING BUT HAD NO REVENUE TO COMPLAIN. NO UNFORTUNATELY AND AND THAT MRS SENATOR OUT WE WE COULD NOT -- PROVIDE SOME VERIFICATION AS TO PART OF MY JOB WAS TO ALSO EXAMINE SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WAR INTERNAL. UP FROM MY PREDECESSOR INTO THOSE OF THE MANAGERS. AND THEN IN THAT RESPECT THAT WAS ONE THING THAT THE WE STRIVE TO CORRECT IMMEDIATELY. AND ENGAGE ARE A CONTRACTOR AND VENDOR FOR THE SOFTWARE AND SAYS WE NEED TO CORRECT IT IMMEDIATELY. AND THROUGH THEIR RESEARCH NUMB IN A MATTER OF A WEEK THEY CAME BACK AND SAYS. WE COULD CLOSE THIS LOOP. WE WILL CONTROL THIS WEEK CLOSEST. NOT THAT NOBODY COULD ACT BACK DATED. IT'S A SOFTWARE THERE SO BUT THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO INDICATION IN A WELL YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SOME ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM OF COMPLAINTS SO IF THINGS ARE GOING ON DOWN IN THE BELLS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION SOMEONE CAN BRING THEM TO YOUR ATTENTION WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE THROUGH. DIFFERING LEVELS OF SUPERVISION THAT MAY NOT IN FACT BECAUSE OPERATIVE IN THE REPORTING. YOU MAY RECALL IN THE AIRFORCE WE HAD A THE CHIEF OF STAFF WHO DID A BY THE NAME OF FOGLEMAN WHO DID IT STAND DOWN WHEN THERE WAS AN AIRCRAFT SHOOT DOWN AND THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE CORE VALUES IN THE AIRFORCE BECAUSE IT WAS. THERE WERE SERIOUS INTEGRITY PROBLEMS IN THE REPORTING ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THE SHOOT DOWN IN THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS ON THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED. INTEGRITY PROBLEMS AND SOMETIMES THE ORGANIZATIONS NATION NEEDS TO BE LIFTED UP BY ITS BOOTSTRAPS. GIVEN A GOOD SHAKE. A AN ORGANIZATION WIDE TRAINING PROGRAM NOT JUST SYSTEM CHANGES AND ENDING A SENTENCE TO A DISCIPLINARY POLICY. IT'S A CULTURAL ISSUE AND WHEN YOU SAW THAT CULTURAL ISSUE I THINK SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS OF GO AWAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WAS A SAID KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS AND I DO SO COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE OF I HAVE A QUESTION FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHAT WHAT IS YOUR CAN YOU GIVE ME OVER ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. MY EXPENSIVE JOKE PARSIFAL I'M A FATHER OF THREE AND YOU IN MY EARLY YEARS IN THE IN THE AIRFORCE -- I WAS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE A CHILDREN BECAUSE I WAS A VOLUNTEER FOR THE U. THOUGHT CENTER BACK IN THAT NO OVERSEAS. AND AS SUCH -- MY EXPERIENCE AND TOOK OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. UP. REVOLVES IN MY LAST SO SEVEN YEARS IN THE AREA AND THE FBI. S. NATIONAL CHILD ID PROGRAM INTO HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND EXTRA EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. SO. I MODE OF THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. OF AWARENESS AND TRAINING AND THE BAY AREA WAS ONE OF MY MIGHT. MY RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENSURING THAT -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE RECOVERY OF KIDNAPPED CHILD VICTIMS OVERSEAS. SO MY A LEVEL OF EDUCATION CHILDHOOD GOES TO THE EXTENT OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW. PEOPLE ARE HOW CHILDREN TO THEIR ENVIRONMENTS BECOME INTO THE DEVELOPMENT BECOME WHERE THEY ARE. AND AYE I BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A CHILD THE CHILD SOLDIER ISSUE IN TERMS OF RADICALIZATION FOR CHILDREN. SO IN TERMS OF EDUCATION I GOT GOT MY EXPERIENCE MORE EMBEDDED INTO. THE APPLICATIONS OF OF INCIDENTS AND ISSUES AND AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE COULD DO PRACTICALLY IN TERMS OF PRESERVING THE SAFETY SECURITY FACTUAL SO YOU HAVE -- TO THE DEGREE AND I HAVE -- I HAVE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS THE GREEN MARKETING OKAY MEISSEN FRENCH AND SPANISH BUT ALSO ASSOCIATES IN ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY -- HAVING BEEN THE OLDEST OF A CHILD I HELPED RAISE THEM MY FOUR SIBLINGS. AND AND MY EXPERIENCE IN THE EARLY STAGES AS A BOY MUNITY WHICH I STILL DO. IN TERMS OF CHILDREN AND AND SOMETHING IT TO THE EXTENT OF FOR PROVIDING SOME FUNDRAISING. FOR CONSCIENTIOUS FOR THE NATIONAL CHILD ID PROGRAM WHICH IS A FINGERPRINTING PROGRAM -- XIN ANY FOR SAID ABOUT THE ATTENTION YOU KNOW CENTER I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE PENSION WHO REALLY OF LET HIM TELL YOU THOUGH. ABOUT HIS CONNECTION TO FORESEE HOW HE CAME ABOUT TO BE THE INTERNAL IT TO BE THE INTERIM I'M ASKING A QUESTION EXCUSE ME -- I LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION -- DO YOU DO YOU HAVE -- ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN GIVE US ARM [inaudible] REGARDING -- WHETHER OR NOT THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAS A ROLE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN AT THIS POINT AND WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF THE THE BALANCE WE HAVE IN OUR REPORT -- I THINK WAS AS OF A PRO. MADAM AUDITOR WAS THE BALANCE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL. RETIREMENT WHAT WAS YOUR DATE OF THAT BALANCE YOU. ARE YOU HAVE -- AND AND I WANTED TO FIND OUT TO WHOM. WHETHER OR NOT SO. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN -- WHAT THE BALANCE IS NOW AND THEN? WHETHER OR NOT -- THE PULLED ACCOUNT HAS BEEN SHIFTED TO A INDIVIDUAL COUNT. FOR THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- CAN YOU DESCRIBE ANY ACTIONS TAKEN PLACE IN REGARDS TO THAT UP UP FOR CLARIFICATIONS THAT -- SENATOR OUR FIRST QUESTION IS IS THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. HERE'S INVOLVED UP PROGRAM AS PART OF HIS TIME IS SPENT YOU KNOW NOW THE SECOND QUESTION WITHOUT THAT OCCURRED ALSO THE DANE. IF YOU'RE IN THE TIME THAT I AM I UNDERSTANDING ENROLLMENT THAT HE IS PART OF THAT HE IS VESTED IN THEIR THE QUESTION THAT WOULD SING FOR ME IS ALL THE RECIPE AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE FUNDS YET WE HAVE NO FORMS TO THAT INDICATED INDICATED THAT HE HAS FILLED AMPLE FILLED THE FUNDS. SO -- HAS THOUGH. IF IF HE HASN'T ROLLED HE IS A RHODES. BECAUSE AS OF THE REPORT. WE GOT OF THE AUDIT REPORT IT SAID HE HAD IT WRITTEN IN RHODESIA. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTION I SO SO. I WANTED TO FIND OUT. IF THE ENROLLMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE ONCE THE AROMA TAKES PLACE. THEN THERE'S A PROCESS -- TO CREATE A INDIVIDUAL COUNT. THAT WILL BE DRAWN ON AT SOME POINT -- IN TERMS OF THAT RETIREMENT ACCOUNT IS THAT CORRECT AYE I CAN CLARIFY BY WEIGHING FIND OUT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT PLEASE. THAT I CAN CLARIFY THAT STATUS -- I THINK WE ARE -- BUMPING UP ON A NOMENCLATURE ISSUE HERE ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM OCCURS WHEN YOU NEED ALL THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS DURING YOUR EMPLOYMENT. NOW TO AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE THE THE FINES WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF LEAVING EMPLOYMENTYOU NEED. TO SUBMIT CERTAIN FORMS AND CERTAIN -- CERTIFICATIONS AND NOTARIZED WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT HE IS. SUBMITTED ANY OF THOSE AND IT'S BEEN MORE THAN SIX MONTHS WE IMAGINE THAT. AT SOME POINT THERE MAY BE A DISPUTE OVER WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEEN SUBMITTED. BUT CURRENTLY. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT MISTER VS IN YOUR HAS SUBMITTED ALL THE REQUIRED FORMS TO BAIL THEMSELVES OF THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT IN THE TIME FRAME THAT IS SPECIFIED IN THE PLAN DOCUMENT. SO HERE'S HE ENROLLED IN THE OF THE SUPPLEMENT IT WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL COUNTY IS SO. MAYBE YOU CAN PROVIDE OUR ORDER WITH THE CURRENT. BALANCE AND STATUS OF SUPPLEMENTAL OF A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT. I DO WILL BE AGREED TO DO THAT. WE WILL AGREE TO PROVIDE THAT THE CURRENT BALANCE -- WITHIN THE COMING WEEK. THIS IS WE CAN [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OBTAIN IT. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. THE CAN SHARE. AND THANK YOU FORUM. THE YOUR COMMENTS UP IN STEPPING INTO OBVIOUSLY A DIFFICULT SIUATION AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE TO TRY. TO RIGHT THE SHIP -- AND ON ON A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I THINK WE GOT SOME OF THE RESPONSES IN TERMS TO THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND REALLY THAT THE ISSUE THEREIN DOT INDICATES MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS MAY HOLD THAT THE FUNDS ARE. UP UNIT THE UP TO WHATEVER EXTENT -- THERE IS IMPROPER USE THAT THE FUNDS ARE REPLENISHED TED. SO I KNOW IT'S HARD RIGHT -- AND I THINK THAT WE CAN SAY THAT OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER THE NEGATION MIGHT BE HAPPENING THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THAT AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS ONE THAT YOU. AGREE WITH THAT THE VERY LEAST US [inaudible] KIND OF MUST START FEELING THAT WAY YES WE WE WE AGREE WITH THAT AUDIT RECOMMENDATION -- WE ARE INFORMED BY THE WRIST OF COUNSEL -- THAT IS REVIEWING IT THAT THAT IS -- A POSSIBILITY AND WE ARE JUST LOOKING CURRENTLY FOR THE CORRECT AVENUE -- BOTH. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE FUNCTIONALLY. UP I THINK AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE ATTORNEY IT NOTICES -- AND I GET THAT. THERE ARE I'M. BUT THAT COULD BE LIFE FOR REASONS WHY I NOTICE IS THEM. IT WILL PUT OUT THERE -- IT COULD BECAUSE SO MANY EXOTIC ABUSE BECAUSE SOME OF OUR STATE AND WHATEVER BUT DOES THE POLICY. INDICATE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAR BASED UPON DIFFERENT REASONS WHY. SOMEONE ATE THEM UP. SAW SOMEONE IS TERMINATOR GETS TO ME AND OTHERS IN OTHER WORDS HOW DOES IT YOU HAVE A PAUSE BACK YOU HAVE A MORE GENEROUS BOSS IN THE STATE. NINETEEN DAYS. JUST SENDING IT IN NINETEEN DAYS WHO CARES OF OUR PARENTS ACROSS WRITER SOME OF THAT A STATE. SENATE THEY'RE NOT AN APPEAL. AND AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S BEING MENTIONED IS THAT HAS SOME WAY TO EXCUSE. SOME OF THESE VIOLATIONS BUT NO THOSE ARE EXCEPTIONS IN THE POLICY THAT ALLOW -- FOR ó ALLOW FOR A SIDESTEPPING THE POLICY [inaudible] IT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT -- THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS WE DID THE FULL REVIEW TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM THAT WAS -- AND THE HARM TO THE COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF THAT. FOR OUR OWN. BUT BETTER MEET -- THAT BEING SAID. I WHAT IT APPEARS MAY HAVE HAPPENED IS. THAT THERE WAS IN THE CORRECT LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THIS NOW THERE IS. A OVERALL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO WHERE PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEIR MANAGERS ARE THEY KNOW THAT. THOSE MANAGERS ACTUALLY DISCUSS UP THE CHAIN IN THAT SHOW. GETS INFORMATION IF THERE IS AN ISSUE. SO NOW YOU CANNOT BE A DOCUMENT ENTRY -- CLERK OR A MID LEVEL MANAGER THAT GETS A BUNCH OF PAPER STACKED ON THEIR DESK AND SCRAMBLES AND BACK DATES A BUNCH OF NOTICES IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED OR IF THERE'S SOMETHING MORE NEFARIOUS IT BACK THAT SIMPLY [inaudible] WON'T. GO UNNOTICED ANYMORE EA THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE SIX THOUSAND AND SO YOU HAVE CAN YOU PROVIDE US WITH. WE COULD PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN YES -- AND TO SHOW EXACTLY WHAT KINDS OF NOTICES THOSE WERE AND AND WE ALSO HAVE ALL THE NOTICES. I THAT WERE BACKDATED PRINTED OUT IN A IN A DATABASE IN A BINDER -- I AT THE FOR C. OFFICE IN THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THE THE AUDITOR -- YEAH I GUESS I'D I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT I THINK THAT -- MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST. THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN. HOW THEIR SERVICES TERMINATED -- THAT HAD COME TO THAT WEBER THERE WASN'T AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR APPEAL. AND I WILL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CERTAINLY THE NUMBERS TO LEAST AGAIN. THE DOCUMENTATION IS CRITICAL UP PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES -- TO DETERMINATION SERVICES TO A CHILD [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] NOW. IN TERMS OF LOOK AT THE I THINK OUR CHAIR A PROPERLY SENATE SO THAT YOU TALK ABOUT INTEGRITY AND CULTURE IT ALWAYS WILL CONSTRUCT THE TOP. AND I'M ONE OF THE TROUBLING ASPECTS IS THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION OF YOU KIND OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SHOW TO ACTIONS AND OR THROUGH DOCUMENTATION. IS JUST WORDS AND WE KNOW THE PRIOR EXACT DIRECTOR SAID THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY [inaudible] AND THE REASON WHY THE AUDIT OCCURRED WAS BECAUSE WORKERS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND YET THE THAT TIME AND AGAIN WE WERE TOLD BY MANAGEMENT ALL THE WORKERS ARE LYING JUST ONE AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO PUT LEVERAGE FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS ON ON ARE NOT YET. EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAID WAS HAPPENING WAS HAPPENING. AND SO THE REASON WHY I MENTION THAT IS WELL FIRST OF ALL. WERE ANY WORKERS THAT COMPLAINT OR RAISED ISSUES FIRED TERMINATED REPRIMANDED IN ANY WAY HARMED. BECAUSE THEY CAME FORWARD. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NO. BECAUSE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOUGHT THAT THAT STATEMENT IS IS STILL. IF SOMEBODY PROVIDES A COMPLAINT AND IS NOT ADDRESS AND IS NOT A DRESS APPROPRIATELY. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOUT WE DAHLE TATE RETALIATED THAT IS A SOMETHING OF THAT THAT WOULD GO TO MY LEVEL. AND TO GO TO THE LEVEL OF DOES EXACTLY THAT MAKE YOU BUT YOU WON'T PRIOR YOU'RE THERE. AND AND I AND THE REASON I'M ASKING YOU THIS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTATEMENT GIVEN THEIR TEN MONTHS AS INTERIM. I THINK EUROPE CONSULTING FOR A FEW MONTHS BEFORE. BUT ANY LEADER THAT COMES AND IS GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. YOU KNOW -- SUITED YOU TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU GOT IN THERE IS TALK OF THE WORKERS. DID YOU TALK TO THE ARMS ONCE HATE ONE ON ONE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PLACE DID YOU. DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT YES YES YES -- A YES OR A WEEK WE HAD THE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I WAS AS AS A DO I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR POLICY. AND MY RESPONSE THERE'S NO BECAUSE I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR PRACTICE I'M GONNA WAIT FOR YOU TO TELL ME. THE PROBLEM AYE AYE GOAL TO YOU SO IN THAT REGARD WHAT ONE OF MY FIRST A OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACTIONS WAS TO ACTUALLY GET TO MEET ALL THE STAFF. AND TO BE OUT THERE LOOKING AT HOW THEY WORK AND WHAT THE RESPONSE DID YOU EVER CONFIDENTIALLY TALK TO SOME OF US HAVE A WHAT HAPPENED WERE YOU EVER HEAR. ANYONE EVER THREATEN YOU DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU TO BACKDATE DATA DID YOU EVER DO THAT THE ABSENCE OF BY ASKING THEIR WITH WHEN I WAS THAT I DID HAVE CONFIDENTIAL. CONVERSATIONS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY PERCEIVE OR HAPPENING IN THOSE WERE PUBLIC CORRECT DID YOU DID YOU EVER ASK AND HE THE WORKERS I AB OF I THINK THAT WE HEARD THAT. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE DONE THE BACKDATING. ARE NO LONGER WITH FORESEES. BUT SO DOES THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THE DATA ENTRY. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S THE WORKERS THAT WERE TERMINATED BUT THAT IT WAS A POT MEAN YOU TOOK MY THOUSAND WAS A POLICY IN PLACE -- THAT IS DIRECTED FROM A SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER LEVEL AND YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE WORKERS TO FIND OUT IF THAT POLICY WAS IN PLACE YOU EVER TALK TO ANYONE IN COMP AND CONFIDENCE. TO FIND OUT IF ANY OF THE WORKERS -- DIE THAT WERE TERMINATED OUR NEW OF THIS PRACTICE WERE INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY. A SUPERIOR NOT SPECIFIC FOR THAT WAS TO IMPLEMENT A EXIT INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT FOR ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO LEFT. AND WITH THAT REPORT THAT WE JUST SAW HANDLED BY THE HR DEPARTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WERE QUITTING. Y. WOULD BE LEAVING TO GO TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WHAT WOULD DEFINING OTHER JOBS WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHY THEY LEFT THE COMPANY. AND WE WEEK WE DID THAT AND THAT WAS PART OF OUR OUT OF HELPING US ESTABLISH A RETENTION POLICY TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED. TO THE IT STAFF TRAINING. DHEA STAFF RECOGNITION DUG THOUGH THE STOP UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM. TO TO TO PROVIDE US WITH DATA YOUR CONCERNS AND ISSUES AND AS SUCH WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WERE. UP EMPLOYEES OF COME TO MEAN TO DURING MY TIME AND HE SAID WE HAVE THIS CONSISTENT STERN AND THIS ISSUE. AND A WHEN THAT WAS DONE CONFIDENTIAL AND CONFIDENTIALLY. AND WHEN I LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS A PRO I CORRECTED. AND WITHOUT GOING TO A DETAILS -- DOES -- INDIVIDUALS WERE -- CAME BACK TO ME SO THANK YOU FOR ME THE CORRECT IN THAT THING JUST -- IT TOOK ME ABOUT THREE WEEKS TO REALLY GET THE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH CORRECT. AND I I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT WAS TO CREATE A NOT JUST TO CREATE BUT TO RE EMPHASIZE THE POLICY OF NO RETALIATION AND THAT IS BEEN -- CREATE A CREATED BY. INCREASED IMPLEMENTED PROVIDED TO THE JAIL LACKEY AND IT IS COR TO THE NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE -- THE EXECUTIVE TEAM WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON FROM IT'S FROM ALL LEVELS OF EMPLOYEES AND WANTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE TAKE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT'S NECESSARY. AND IS COMMITTED. TO NOT RETALIATE AGAINST ANY EMPLOYEE WHO AYE HAS ANY COMPLAINT REGARDING ANY SORT OF COMPLAINTS ISSUE. THANK YOU AND I'M. A LOT OF COMMENT ABOUT THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION LIKE THIS ALL HAPPEN BEFORE PERFECT SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE REFUSING IT -- SIR YOU ARE APPOINTED BY AND REPORT TO THE BOARD [inaudible] THAT'S RIGHT [inaudible] SO. CONSIDERING ALL THIS HAPPENED BEFORE -- ARE ANY OF THE SAME BOARD MEMBERS ON THE BOARD THAT WERE THERE. IN THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION YES HOW MANY -- OR AND HOW MAY SERVE ON THE BOARD -- RIGHT NO OF SEVEN OR EIGHT EIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL NEW BOARD MEMBER OKAY SO AT LEAST HALF OF THE BOARD. ARE THE SAME BOARD MEMBERS OVER THERE -- BUT IN BRITAIN THESE ISSUES WERE. A PRETTY SEVERE ISSUES WERE OCCURRING. IF IF IF I MIGHT ADD. DEED THAT THE BOARDS UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPERATIONS IS ONLY CLEAR ANSWERS THINK IF IN FACT MY PREDECESSOR. PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. DAVID I AS A BUT INTO EXACTLY DIRECT TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THAT PROCESS. NOW IF I WOULD HOLD SOMETHING THEN THEN THAT ONLY I WOULD KNOW IT WITH THAT INFORMATION SO. THAT ONE THING THAT'S TANTAMOUNT TO THE PROCESS NOW IS TRANSPARENCY AND THE AT THE DISK THINK CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT. IT'S TRANSPARENCY THAT WE SEE AND IF I AYE INFORMED ABOARD AS EVERY ASPECT OF THE OPERATION. AND TOWARDS THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT I I DO RECALL THAT DURING A AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOARD ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT KNOWS. BUT I'M AGAIN INTEGRITY STARTS ATOP THE TOP ANDMY RECOLLECTION ALLOWS IS RECURRING WAS AT THE BOARD. AND THE EXACT DIRECTOR -- WHERE ARE SPEAKING FROM THE SAME TALKING POINTS AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND? THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP OF EVERYONE INVOLVED NOT JUST YOU ONE PERSON CAN'T COMING YEAR AND DO IT ON OUR OWN -- THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE CHANGE AND THAT THE WORKERS ARE RESPECTED AND THAT THE CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR IN A WAY THAT WE EXPECT. WHEN OUR MONEY IS COMING DOWN -- IT TOO TO SUPPORT THEM AND SELF BUT BUT THANK YOU SIR BUT I'D JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT. LAST RESPONSE -- THE BOARD HAS. YEAH I SEEN A 50% TURNOVER SENSE THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION -- MAYOR BROWN I MYSELF HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT ADDITIONAL TALENT BE BROUGHT TO THE BOARD AND THERE IS ACTIVE SEARCH. FOR TALENTED NEW BOARD MEMBERS HOWEVER AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THAT WITH A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE SORT OF TIME COMMITMENT FOR C. DOES FROM ITS BOARD MEMBERS. THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE FASTEST AND EASIEST -- SO TALENT SEARCH THE I I GET THAT I'VE BEEN ON A NUMBER OF NONPROFIT BOARDS IT'S THAT CERTAINLY THANKLESS WORK IN MANY WAYS. I'M I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MAYBE AN ACTUAL PROVIDER OR A PARENT. I'D TO SERVE ON THE BOARD AS WELL COULD PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS NOT EXISTED IN LEADERSHIP -- INSULIN ON THE BOARD IN THE TO THE EXTENT I BELIEVE IT SHOULD ATTACK YOU.

CONTACT EACH AGENCIES WORK HARD TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY EAST AND EFFICIENCIES ARE IN PLACE. FROM THE BOARD TO THE PROGRAM LEVEL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH LEVELS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE. BOTH PROGRAMMATIC LEE AND FISCALLY. WE ALSO KNOW AND DEEPLY APPRECIATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES THEIR ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENTS. I SYSTEM VERY SERIOUSLY. WE APPRECIATE THIS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS WITH THE LARGEST AND ONE OF THE BEST EARLY LEARNING SYSTEMS IN THE NATION AND ALSO AT TIMES IS COMPLICATED. AND AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO APPLY THE FEDERAL AND STATELAWS TO MAKE OUR SYSTEMS WORK WE ALSO DO SO WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES. EACH OF OUR OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED ANNUALLY THIS IS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE. AS WELL AS OUR TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS AND HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IF CONTRACT ISSUE SURFACED ABOUT THE PROGRAM OR THE FISCAL CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACTOR OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS OUT MINOR APPROACH AND STEPS FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES WITH THE CONTRACTOR. WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. EVERY CONTRACTOR RECEIVES ONGOING MONITORING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRAINING AND SUPPORT FROM OUR EARLY EDUCATION SUPPORT STAFF. HI MY NAME IS CAN TARGET AGAIN AND AND JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE EARLY EDUCATION SUPPORT DIVISION DOES THE OUT ITS INVESTIGATION. DIVISION THAT'S RECEIVE ON FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS. EVERY YEAR FROM ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT RECEIVE FUNDING AND THEY ARE. PERFORMED BY IS AN INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS AND THEY ARE -- PERFORMED UNDER THE UNIFORM. BATON. FEDERAL UNIFORM GUIDANCE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT SO AND THOSE ARE ONLY ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION PRESS OFTEN -- WE DO OUR OWN ANALYSIS OF THOSE REPORTS ENOUGH AND WORK WITH THE CPA'S AND AND GET CLARIFYING INFORMATION. SOMETIMES WE DO IDENTIFY COSTS THAT I NEED TO BE ADJUSTED. ON BUT AGAIN THAT IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION -- CURRENTLY HAS WITH NO TO BE. THE AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION IS -- COMPLETING ITS OWN PERFORMANCE AUDIT WHICH IS AN IN DEPTH PERFORMANCE AUDIT AND WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE. UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ADMINISTRATION OF AND THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR FOR SEATS FROM ON JULY TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH. MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE AREAS THAT WE'RE COVERING OUR MARK FISCALLY FOCUSED ELIGIBILITY GENERAL EXPENDITURES PAYROLL EXPENDITURES COST ALLOCATION AND INCLUDES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE RELATED PARTY TYPE TRANSACTIONS. SO ON THIS AUDIT WAS INTENDED TO TAKE AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME BE BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL IN THE DEATH OF THE AUDIT. HOWEVER IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT O PLEADED BEGIN THIS AUDIT PRIOR TO SEE. AUDIT. AND ON DURING THE AUDIT THE AGENCY WAS EXPERIENCE EXTENSIVE REQUEST OF DOCUMENTATION AND THEIR TIME FROM BOTH OF US AT THE SAME TIME SO WE DID SAY HEY OKAY WILL TAKE A STEP BACK. WELL THAT YOU AND WORK WITH THE STATE AUDITOR AND THEN WE WILL RECONNECT AFTER THAT WHICH WE DID AND WHERE IN THAT -- FINAL PROCESSES OF WRAPPING THAT UP SO WE DO EXPECT THE REPORT TO BE ISSUED. ON ABOUT SEPTEMBER AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL HAVE THOSE RESULTS. FORTHCOMING. AND SO WITH THAT I WILL TALK ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SEE A FACE ON IT -- WHAT I'LL TALK ABOUT FIRST OF THE FOUR THAT WE AGREE WITH AND AND THE ACTIONS THAT WE ARE TAKING RELATED TO THOSE AND THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT THE LAST TWO AFTER THAT? SO AND THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION. AND THAT WE CONCUR WITH. PART OF MY LIFE WITH YOU -- IS AYE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER NINE IT'S ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF THE AUDIT REPORT. SO AND THAT RECOMMENDATION -- REQUIRES THAT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO AND RECALCULATE THE REIMBURSABLE COST THREE RELATED TO THAT QUESTION COSTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND WE WILL DO THAT AND WE WILL DO THAT AT THE END OF A OUR IDEA IS WILD SO WE DO THAT ALL AT ONE TIME. BASED ON WHATEVER THE RESULTS ARE AT THAT. AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL -- OCCUR. AND THAT THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION IS NUMBER TEN ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE AT THE REPORT -- AND THAT ASSETS -- TO CONDUCT ANY FOLLOW REVIEWS OF FORCES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO WE WILL CONSIDER WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AFTER THAT REPORTS NOT. ONLY RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT I'M ARE RELATED TO THE AUDIT. AND THEN -- JUST FOR CLARITY EDUCATIONAL ROUTINELY CONSIDERS REST FROM ALL DIFFERENT AREAS AND NOT IT DIVISION AT HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH ON GOING FUTURE. AUDITS IN AREAS THAT HAVE RISK THAT EGGS IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE RETAIN THE ROUTINELY DO WE DID IT BEFORE CFA THOUGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO AFTER -- THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION RELATES TO THE MONITORING EFFORTS BY THE EARLY EDUCATION SUPPORT DIVISION AND I AM. WE AGREE THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS WEEKEND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON DOCUMENTATION HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT'S NOT EVERY AREA THAT NO DOCUMENTATION WAS ON PRESENTED AREAS WHERE THERE IS NOT COMPLIANCE. THERE IS DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT THAT I'M AREAS OF ELIGIBILITY THERE IS DOCUMENTATION TO THE PART THAT'S SO -- HOWEVER AND THE OTHER AREAS. WHAT WILL BE ADDED IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE DOCUMENTS REVIEWED -- OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE MADE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH INTERVIEWS ONE THING THAT I DO WANNA NOTE THOUGH IS THAT -- I MONITORING REVIEW AND THE AUDIT ARE REALLY TWO DIFFERENT THINGS MONITORING REVIEWS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAPPEN WITH PROGRAMS THAT THEY PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY LOOK AT CERTAIN AREAS-- AND THEY WORK WITH AGENCIES -- THERE'S A LOT AGENCIES TO COVER IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE THE SAME -- IN DEPTH LEVEL OF REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION. OR NECESSARILY -- THAT THEY END UP LEVEL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED OF AN ARTIST I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE REALLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS -- THE MONITORING REVIEWS TECHNO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING -- PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY READ FIVE SIX CETERA. AND IN THAT COULD RESULT IN AN AUDIT WHICH IN THIS CASE DEAD -- WE ARE REQUESTED TO THE DO THE AUDIT AND WE HAD STARTED THAT. IN MARCH I TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO -- FIXED Y. TO POINT THAT OUT AND BUT AGAIN I WE AGREE THAT WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT WAY DOWN BE OF ASSISTANCE -- TO FOLLOW BEHIND THE CONCLUSIONS THAT ARE REACHED IN THE AREAS FOR COMPLIANCE IS REACHED. AND THE LAST AREA THAT WE AGREE WITH AS WELL IS THAT I RELATED TO THAT. PENSION FUNDS. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ITS ONGOING CURRENTLY SO AND TELL THAT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IS COMPLETED. THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD DETERMINE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO TAKE IT SHOULD BE NOTED TOO THAT -- IN THAT -- AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT THE LAST TIME FUNDS WERE I'M PROVIDED FOR THIS ON PENSION FUND WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE SO THAT'S A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. BUT WE WILL TAKE ACTION AGAIN BASED ON THE THE LAWSUIT HOW THAT TURNS OUT. THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE WANNA ANSWER BACK. TO OURRECOMMENDATION NUMBER. FOUR WHICH DOES TALK ABOUT THE APPEAL PROCESS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT -- BEFORE HOWEVER -- THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS SURPRISED CONCERNED. ABOUT LACTATE BACKDATING OF THE NOTICES -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILIES TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION TIMELY AND LEAD WE EXPECT THAT AND COMMUNICATION. THE REASON WHY WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT -- PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THERE ARE. REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO FAMILIES. IN THIS CASE IT WAS CONCEALED. BY THE BACKDATING OUT. BUT THERE ARE PROCEDURES IN PLACE AND ALSO WE DO HAVE THE FORM THE ONE THING THAT THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE AS WELL IS THAT. THE VALID GROUNDS FOR APPEALING A NOTICE OF ACTION WHATEVER THAT ACTION IS SIMPLY THAT THE FAMILY DISAGREE. THAT'S ALL I THEY DISAGREE AND THEY CAN APPEAL TO THE AGENCY. IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT -- DECISION THEY CAN APPEAL TO THAT APARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE SAMPLE FORM IT DOES INCLUDE THE INFORMATION THE KEY INFORMATION AND SEE IF THERE'S RECOMMENDATION OF WHO TO CONTACT INCLUDES A FAX NUMBER. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S ADDRESS THE IT APPEALS COORDINATOR AT A PHONE NUMBER SO THAT THERE IS THAT INFORMATION THEY'RE ALREADY. IT WAS NOT CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. WHICH IS IT IS NOT DUE TO THE LACK OF DIRECTION BY EDUCATION BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT THAT INFORMATION TO BE. INCLUDED IN THOSE NOTICES. THE OTHER I'M ITEM THAT I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE STATE AUDITOR DID ALLUDED TO WAS ALLOW IS THAT -- WELL THAT THE MONITORING VISIT DOES LOOK AT THE NOTICES. THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DO. YOU KNOW ADVANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AUDIT PROCEDURES THAT IS SOMETHING AND AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISSUE WAS WITHOUT SO IT CAN BE -- APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT AND MONITORING OF REVIEW. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MORE RELATED TO RISKS IDENTIFIED AND A RESPONSE AND ABOUT IT. OKAY AND THEN THOUGH WANTS ITEM. RELATES THAT CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF EACH EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND THAT WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IT DID RECEIVE SOME CLARIFYING INFORMATION YESTERDAY RELATED TO THIS OUR RECOMMENDATION. AND NOTING THAT THE STATE ORDER DOES NOT I INTERPRET THAT THEY'RE TO BE TWO SEPARATE APPRAISALS THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER WE STILL WANTED TO KNOW THAT -- THAT PUTS THE PROGRAM'S SELF EVALUATION PROCESS. WAS ADOPTED THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND EDUCATION IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY IN THE REGULATORY AGENCY CHARGED. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM'S. THEREFORE -- WE FILL THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S INTERPRET INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS REQUIRED. AND SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE HERE ON ONE THING TO CONSIDER AS A STATEWIDE PROCESS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT -- DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND SIZES AND SO -- THAT THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT ALL AGENCIES KIDNEY. AND SO WELL YES THAT WERE TO BE INVOLVED IF WE FEEL THAT THEY COULD RELY ON THE STAFF'S ASSESSMENT. IN THAT PROCESS AND THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS AS WELL THAT THE DOCUMENTATION THAT COULD TAKE PLACE. SO THOSE WERE THAT PROTECT PERSPECTIVES THAT WE WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. AND DAM WERE. AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS FULLER JUST ASK A QUICK. ONE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BACKDATING YOU KNOW WE'VE. SORT OF DANCED AROUND THE IDENTITY ISSUES THESE ARE PERSONNEL ISSUES WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED INDIVIDUALS WHOM. DID OR DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THIS WHAT I WOULD CALL MISCONDUCT BUT IS IT. IS IT POSSIBLE IN OUR STATE THAT THE FOLKS AT ENGAGED IN THIS BACKDATING. A POP UP AT ANOTHER ORGANIZATION AND DO THE VERY SAME THING. FELLOW AT THE MASSES EDUCATION THIS IS STATE MONEY -- MISSES SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER THE PURVIEW THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I GUESS JUST TO RESTATE IT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS. WHO ENGAGED IN THESE BACKDATING? ACTIVITIES COULD POP UP AT ANOTHER ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT. RECEIVE STATE MONEY AND DO THE VERY SAME THING. SO FIRST WE TAKE THIS MATTER VERY SERIOUSLY I AM NOT. SUGGESTING THAT YOU DIDN'T IN I'M MY QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS A CRITICISM OF THE DEPARTMENT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO. SO AND THAT WE DO NOT TRACK EMPLOYEES OF ALL THEIR FIVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED CONTRACTS TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY COULD LAND WE INSTEAD WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THAT HAPPENED. AND AND AS KIM STATED READ DO NOT DO FORENSIC AUDITS THAT DIVE INTO THE IT SYSTEMS THEMSELVES BUT IN CHECKING WITH A CONTRACTOR. AND THEN THAT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY USED THERE SEEM TO BE A FLY ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF FOR IT SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PROGRAMMED CORRECTLY AND HENCE WAS ALLOWING FOR IT SO [inaudible] WHAT? WHILE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES WE ACTUALLY THINK THERE IS A SYSTEMS ISSUE AND THAT IT SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL OF THAT IN THE FUTURE. WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE HITS AND IT'S REALLY A SHAME THAT WE HAVE TO DESIGN SYSTEMS TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM ENGAGING IN INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT. I DID NOT ASK THE PRIOR PANEL WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED -- RECEIVED APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHETHER THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS IN WRITING AND PLACED IN A PERSONNEL FILE SO THAT SOMEONE. WHO DOES A BACKGROUND CHECK COULD POSSIBLY AND COVER AN INDIVIDUAL WHO ENGAGES IN -- INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT INVOLVES A INTEGRITY. BUT I THINK THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE. WHERE I CAN RESULT HERE? THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE SENATOR BILL. ARMSTRONG YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE GOING -- TO HARD STOP WELL I'D THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE SO THIS IS IT IS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MANY INCLUDING YOU AND SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK IF I CHAIRMAN -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF -- FIRST OF ALL -- AND WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU. AND AND THE PEOPLE HERE THAT TOM. A LETTER WAS SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT IN MARCH PASSING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. REGARDING A COMPLIANCE -- AND WAS SENT BY EIGHT LEGISLATORS WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE RESPONSE. TO OUR LETTER -- RESPONDED TO SO THAT I CAN GET. RESPONSE -- ON THESE ISSUES THAT WE ASK -- WE HEARD. WE HEARD -- SOME OF THE COMETS ARE RELATED. TO THE QUESTIONS WE HAD THE LETTER. TO SPECIFICALLY ASKED -- TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES WE WANTED INFORMATION ON ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND FINDING OUT SO. WHAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON IN TERMS OF? THE COMPLIANCE PART -- LET'S GET A RESPONSE AMENDED YOU ALL HAVE THE LETTER AS SOON. I PERSONALLY DON'T OF THE LETTER I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP IN AND FIND OUT WITHOUT OKAY I APPRECIATED IF YOU WOULD AND IF YOU WOULD EXPEDITE THE RESPONSE AND SEND IT THROUGH THE THANK YOU. THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MS SOBRE SUCHY AND A COPY -- TO CENTER BILL PLEASE. THANK YOU AND NOW IF WE NEED TO WILL WRITE ANOTHER LETTER MAYBE GET A FEW MORE SIGNATURES ON IT. MAYBE IT WASN'T ENOUGH MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT I THINK GO. IF I GET -- LIKE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ME I'M VERY GOOD ABOUT GETTING SIGNATURES ON LETTERS. AS YOU KNOW -- SO -- BUT ANYWAY -- THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD OF HERE THIS TODAY -- WAS WE HAD -- A PROCESS THAT WAS KINDA CONFUSING TO ME AND AND IT WAS ON APRIL AND APRIL EARLY APRIL THERE WAS -- NOTIFICATION THAT DO THE FINDINGS THE OF OUR AUDITOR'S REPORT -- THERE WOULD BE NO OFFER CONTINUE FUNDING FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND THEN A SUBSEQUENT NEXT THE MONTH AFTER THAT. THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PANEL THAT OVERTURNED A DECISION DECIDE TO FUND THE AGENCY. FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR ON A CONDITIONAL CONTRACT BASIS AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS. HE EXPLAIN THAT PROCESS AND HAS IT BEEN USED IN THE PAST -- FREQUENTLY WERE INFREQUENTLY AND WHAT PARTICULAR ISSUES WERE USED TO BASE THAT DECISION. WAS IT A OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS THAT -- PEOPLE WERE INCH THAT WERE INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT -- NOTIFIED -- WAS THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO BY THE DEPARTMENT -- TWO CHANGE THE RECOMMENDATION -- AND IT IS A SON COMMENTER COMIN -- AND YOU HAVE A LIST OF THE CONDITIONS THAT WE PLEASE SUPPOSEDLY OUT OF ITS CONDITIONALLY APPROVED. SOMEONE I KNOW -- WHAT THE PROCESS IS? OF WHAT PART WHAT PUBLIC INPUT DID YOU HAVE -- ON THAT -- WHAT'S WITH OUT OF THAT HAPPENED. SARAH DOESN'T NEED TO WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE THIS ADMINISTRATOR. PANEL THAT WE HAD MAKE THE DECISION CAN YOU GIVE US THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE. BUT LET ME I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE QUESTION AMOUNTS OF AREAS BUT I AM SURE I DON'T HAVE THAN. NAMES OF THE PEOPLE SO IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW POWERBALL GET TO THAT IN A SECOND WE CAN GET YOU THOSE. BUT AND THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGE IN A STANDARD PROCESS THAT WE REVIEW ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS BY. SUE THE PUBLIC PART HAPPENS AHEAD OF TIME AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN SAY ABOUT THE PUBLIC IMPACT THAT WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS. AND I'M DID IT REALLY IN DEPTH AND ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF THIS CONTRACTOR OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS INCLUING REQUESTING A STATE AND OUGHT TO BE DONE BY OUR OWN ON ITS INVESTIGATION. DEPARTMENT THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR A CONTRACTS IS CALLED CASE CONFERENCE AND IN THAT PROCESS YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE STAFF ENGAGED. FROM THE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED THAT THE AGENCY BE SENT A NOTICE OF PROPOSED ACTION AROUND NON RENEWAL. PER THAT REGULATION FORESEES IS ALLOWED TO APPEAL THAT RECOMMENDATION AND THEY DID SO. THE APPEAL WAS SUBMITTED AS AN ORAL PRESENTATION BEFORE AN INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PANEL THAT'S THE A A RP. AND NOT A RP IS A SIGN BY THE DEPARTMENT IT IS NOT HEARING SO IT'S NOT A PUBLIC PROCESS. WITH AND BACK AND FORTH DIALOGUE BUT MANY THE AS A PROCESS. THAT ENGAGES THE CONTRACTOR TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE A RESPONSE RELATED TO THE CASE CONFERENCE FINDINGS. THAT MINISTRY OF REVIEW PANEL IN THIS INSTANCE FOUND THE CONDITIONAL STATUS WAS MORE APPROPRIATE THAN TERMINATION. THE A A RP IS AN INDEPENDENT PANEL THAT REVIEWS THE EVIDENCE AND FACTS INDEPENDENT OF STAFF INVOLVED OR AND RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE CASE CONFERENCE PROCESS. THEY LOOK CONSISTENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESSES APPLIED ACROSS ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS AND ACROSS ANYONE WHO MAY BE APPEALING THEIR DECISION SO THAT IS OBJECTIVE AND CONSISTENT. THE FORCES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPEALED THE ACTION RECOMMENDED BY CASE CONFERENCE. AND ALSO SEND A RESPONSE TO THE REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR ALL OF THOSE WERE INCLUDED IN THE ERP. STATE CONSIDERED THE INFORMATION AND THE ORAL PRESENTATION BEFORE MODIFYING THE KEYS CONFERENCES COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION OF NO OFFER OF CONTINUED FUNDING. TO AN OFFER OF CONDITIONAL CONTRACTS STATUS WITH THE MUST BE MEANT BY THE CONTRACTOR AS WELL AS ENHANCED OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING. DO YOU HAVE A OF FILE ON THE APPEAL. I DON'T IS THERE -- THE ADMINISTRATIVO. REVIEW PANEL -- DO THEY HAVE A FILE ON THE APPEAL. THEY HAVE A FINAL LETTER THAT IS ISSUE THEY HAVE A FILE LIKE WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS. INFORMATION THAT WAS SUBMITTED. ARM DOCUMENTS OF CONTACTS WHO CONTACTED THEM. AND ACCEPT. THEIR AN INDEPENDENT PAN SEPARATE FROM CONTACTS THAT PUBLIC RECORDS[inaudible] YES THEN THE OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE COPIES OF THOSE PUBLIC RECORDS. OKAY RELATED TO THE SO WE CAN HAVE THEM REVIEWED BY. OURSELVES IN THE AUDITOR FOR THE COMPLETE COPY OF THAT. RECORD I WOULD APPRECIATE IT -- DO YOU -- DO YOU HAVE -- WHAT WHERE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF? THE THE APPEAL DECISION THAT WAS MADE. AT BECAUSE THAT IS INDEPENDENT I AM ACTUALLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS ITSELF I HAVE TO BE KEPT SEPARATE. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY LISTENED TO THE ORAL PRESENTATIONS. AS WELL AS AND LOOKING THROUGH FOR THE CONSISTENCIES AND IT WAS THE ORAL PRESENTATION ALONG WITH THE RESPONSES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE. REGARDING THE STATE AUDIT. AND LOOKING AT THAT IS WHERE THEY DETERMINED TO MAKE IT AN OFFER OF CONDITIONAL CONTRACTS STATUS SO THIS IS A OWN APPEAL PROCESS. WHERE IT'S SORT OF ONE SIDED THE -- HOW IT CAN PRESENT? INFORMATION AND MATERIALS. BUT NOBODY ELSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PUBLIC PROCESS. IS THAT CORRECT IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PANEL NOT A HEARING SO IT'S IS NOT -- WHERE -- LIKE LEGISLATORS WHO SUBMIT A LETTER A MONTH BEFORE WOULD BE NOTIFIED ABOUT IT OR ANY OTHER INTERESTED PARTY. THAT EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT -- THIS THIS -- ISSUE -- WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. TO ATTEND OR PARTICIPATE OR BE INFORMED ABOUT THE PROCESS WE DID HAVE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ATTENDING THEY ARE NOT AT THERE'S NO TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN OFFICIAL HEARING. SO LEGISLATORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE PROCESS THERE'S NO. AND EVEN THOUGH WE WROTE A LETTER SAYING EIGHT OF US AT LEAST. ASKED TO BE INFORMED ABOUT IT AND WE WE'RE NOT INFORMED. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. MISCOMMUNICATION THAT HAPPENS TARA I WILL LOOK INTO THE LETTER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. BATES AND THERE ISN'T A CHANCE AND NOT PROCESS [inaudible] THE PART FOR WHERE WE REALLY TAKE THE PUBLIC IMPLIED SERIOUSLY AS WHEN WE DROP AND YOU ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF OUR CONTRACTS. AND IT I FEEL LIKE THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT WE DID MULTIPLE SITE VISITS WE DEAD ON ANNOUNCED LATE VISITS TO THE CONTRACTOR. AND FROM THAT DEVELOPED WENT THROUGH BOTH ARMED FEDERAL MONITORING AS WELL AS OUR STATE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS REQUESTING AN AUDIT FROM OUR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATION UNITED YOU APPOINT THIS A INDEPENDENT -- REVIEW PANEL ALL. WHO DOESN'T DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS BUT IS INDEPENDENT? AND WHO APPOINTS THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO CREATE THESE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANELS [inaudible] THERE'S AND STAFF THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE ACTUAL CONTRACTS IN AND NOT CLOSE TO IT SO THERE ARE THERE IS SOMEONE FROM THE EDUCATION SUPPORT DIVISION BUT IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE COMPLETELY NEUTRAL. WHO HAS NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE DISCUSSION OR HEARD ANY INFORMATION ABOUT A CONTRACT? AND WE ALSO HAVE THE LEGAL STAFF ANA AND AUDIT STAFF IN A FISCAL STAFF SO THERE'S REPRESENTATION FROM ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. ON THAT REVIEW PANEL SO THERE IS A LAWYER. MAYBE SOLELY FROM THE AUDIT. RIGHT THAT'S NOT INVOLVED IN NOT A OR THE SNOW HAS BEEN HOT AND PLEASE LEAVE THAT TRIP FROM THE PROCESS AT THE IN THE STAFFER AND ANOTHER AREA I DEVELOPMENT ISSUES [inaudible] SO -- THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PANEL IS. UNDER THE RULES CREATED BY WHAT. IN IT IS A CREATED BY STATUTE. REGULATION UN DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES. HOW IS THIS -- CONTRACT -- RENEWAL APPEAL. PROCESS CREATED IS IS IS A STATUTORILY CREATED OR HOUSE IT CREATED IT'S PART OF OUR REGULATIONS. SO YOU CREATED YOURSELF BEGUN A RECEPTOR REGULATIONS. AND NOW DID YOU PUBLISH THOSE REGULATIONS WE I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND ARE. OUT FOR PUBLIC HEARING THEY GET PUBLIC FEEDBACK BACK ON THEM AND BASED ON THE PUBLIC FEEDBACK YOU THEN MODIFYING COMPLETE THE REGULATORY PACKAGE. SO DO YOU FEEL THAT -- TAKING ONE SIDE ONCE YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A CONTROVERSY. AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. CHILD CARE IN THEIR COUNTY. OF TO ALMOST TWO MILLION PEOPLE. THAT NOT INFORMING THEM OF THIS PROCESS IN THAT APPEAL IS -- APPROPRIATE. OR ETHICAL WERE. HOUSE INTEGRITY WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT KIND OF PROCESS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT AS A POLICY YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED. I THINK THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS TO WEIGH. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONCE IS TO KEEP A PROCESS INDEPENDENT SO THAT WE KNOW THAT. THE PERSONAL FEELINGS OR AT CONNECTIONS TO VARIOUS THINGS LIKE A CONTRACTOR NOT WAIT AND BUT IT IS APPLY CONSISTENTLY ACROSS A SERIES OF CONTRACTS IN THE SAME MANNER [inaudible] OKAY SO. THE OPEN NURSES NOT. THE THE ISSUE. FOR THE DEPARTMENT I THINK I THINK. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THESE APPEALS AND THE PROCESS. FOR SINCE THEY ONLY HEAR ONE SIDE OF THE QUESTION -- OR ONE SIDE OF THE ISSUE. AND THERE'S NO STATUTE. THE GREAT SEIZE APPEAL PROCESS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. CONTRACTS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING -- TO QUESTION I THINK GO. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE INTEREST OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN. ON THOSE -- IT'S ARE FORTUNATE WE WERE NOTIFIED ITS OF FORTUNE PUBLIC WAS NOT INVOLVED [inaudible] AND IT SHOWS A CULTURE THAT I DON'T PARTICULAR APPRECIATE IT. YOU KNOW. SO I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS -- CHAIRMAN BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU. TO BILL TO HEAR A FEW PEOPLE. THERE WERE LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU SENATOR BELL OF ANY OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS. FOR I THINK YOU I THINK I CAN JUST REITERATE THAT WE ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE WORK HARD EVERY DAY FOR THIS. AND AND WE ALSO TOOK COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC VERY SERIOUSLY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MONITORING WE HAVE DONE OVER THIS CONTRACTOR. WHEN WE HAVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED CONTRACTS TO MONITOR EVERY SINGLE YEAR? REALLY SHOWS WITH ONLY EIGHTEEN STAFF TO MONITOR THAT WE PUT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO JUST ONE CONTRACTOR. WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF OUR QUESTIONS IS BEING. CRITICAL OF WHAT YOU DO EACH AND EVERY DAY FOR ALL THE REST OF US OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME. AND PRESENT HERE TODAY I HAD ONE I FOLLOW UP COMMENT THAT I DID WANT TO MENTION AS WELL I'M RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE PERFORMANCE ON IT IS ONGOING. WE WOULD WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE RESULTS OF THAT AUDIT. IN CONCLUSION WITH THE C. ESSAYS ON IT BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T WANT TO PREMATURELY DISRUPT. SERVICES TO CHILDREN EITHER NO ACTUALLY NOT IF IT AND I'M SURE YOU MAINTAIN YOUR CONTACT WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS -- THROUGH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO SENATOR BILL AS YOU MOVE ALONG FLUID APPRECIATE YOU DOING SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. OKAY THIS IS NOW THE TIME FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. I'D THEIR AYE IT DOES MATTER TO ME DIPPING ON HOW MANY THERE ARE -- YOU FEEL FREE TO HAVE A SEAT. BOTH OF YOU. HI MY NAME IS VALENTINA'S I'M FORESEES. I'VE BOMB RECEIVE. FORESEES I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND SIX I BILL FORESEES FOR ABOUT -- GOING ON FIVE YEARS I'M WORKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE DEPEND ON THE FAMILY CHILDCARE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN RECEIVE QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION IF IT WAS NOT FOR SEIZE THAT WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO FOR CHILDCARE COSTS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AUDIT IT VERIFIED WHAT I EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND AS A PARENT RECEIVING SUBSIDIES -- IT SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT THE EXCEPTION BUT IT WAS KIND OF A WORKING RULE THAT FORESEES HAD. WITH THEM THE POLICIES THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING -- IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT ALONE BUT I SADDENS ME TO KNOW HOW MANY OTHER FAMILIES. HAVE WENT THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND ULTIMATELY LOST CHILD CARE -- THESE ISSUES INCLUDE MISTAKES WITH DETERMINING MY FAMILY'S ELIGIBILITY ISSUES WITH THEIR CHILD CARE PROVIDER BEING P. BILLY -- BMC SENT INCORRECT NOTICES OF ACTIONS AND A LACK OF INFORMATION AND ACCESSIBILITY TO APPEAL PROCESSES -- I SPOKE OUT HERE AND I REQUESTED -- TO HAVE THIS AUDIT THE DAY AFTER I CAME HERE MY M. SERVICES WERE TERMINATED I DID FILE AN APPEAL -- COLLETTE. AND JACK WERE ON MY APPEAL THEY SAT IN THE MY APPEAL THEY VIOLATED ALL MY RIGHTS OF MY APPEAL I HAD TO SEEK OUT. COUNSEL TO ASSIST ME IN MY APPEAL ULTIMATELY THEY WERE FOUND THAT THEY HAD VIOLATED ALL OF THE PROCESSES THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR HAND BOOK AND I WAS REINSTATED -- I AM CONCERNED THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT INTEGRITY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OUR BOARD MEMBER OF THE BOARD MEMBERS THERE IS ONE BOARD MEMBER IN PARTICULAR WHO WAS INVOLVED IN ANOTHER SCANDAL IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WHERE ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT GIVEN JAIL TIME HE WAS REQUIRED TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO THE FACT THAT HE SITTING ON FORESEES BOARD IS VERY CONCERNING? THE FACT THAT FRED VILLASENOR HAND PICKED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. AND OUR INTERIM DIRECTOR WAS IS A GOOD FRIEND OF THIS BOARD MEMBER SO THEY'RE VERY CLOSELY IN TIED AS THEY SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT THERE HASN'T BEEN CHANGED IN MANAGEMENT. THERE'S BEEN CHANGE OF TITLES SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SCRUPULOUS ACTIVITIES ARE STILL WITHIN THE AGENCY BUT NOW WITH THE HIGHER TITLE. SO IT IS CONCERNING I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT -- THEY'RE STILL FUNCTIONING -- I WAS HOPING THAT THE CONTRACT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISABLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSOURCED TO OTHER AGENCIES -- I I'M I'M PRETTY OUTRAGED WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AND PRETTY OUTRAGED WITH. THE STAFF THAT ARE STILL AT THE HELM OF THE SHIP EVEN THOUGH THE THE MAIN FRED HAS LEFT HIS PREDECESSORS HAVE TOOK IT OVER SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CHANGE IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN -- I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN. PROCEDURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAT FORESEES IS TRYING TO FOLLOW UP ON IN REGARDS TO THIS AUDIT -- I I AM WORKING WITH FEAR EVERY TIME THAT THEY ASKED ME. TO SIGN SOMETHING THERE'S A FEAR OF LIKE REP I'M AFRAID TO LOSE MY CHILD CARE THERE IS DEFINITELY A TRUST ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED -- IT IS EIGHT IT LEAVES ME EVERY DAY QUESTIONING EVERYTHING THAT THEY ASKED ME TO DO WHEN I HAVE TO REPORT CHANGES I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE I AM IN CONSTANT FEAR OF LOSING MY CHILD CARE. AGAIN MY NAME IS VALENTINA RAMALLAH'S I THINK ILLNESS THANK YOU FOR COMING TO WORK TO PRESENT TODAY WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND CERTAINLY. HAVE HEARD IN APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IF IF YOU ALL COULD KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ABOUT TWO MINUTES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- I REALIZE YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO TRY TO HEAR IT SO. OKAY MANAGEMENT SANCHES I HAVE CHILDREN RECEIVED. THROUGH FORESEES PERSONS HAVE BEEN VERY. FRUSTRATING THE MEANING AND INSULTING -- I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT LIMIT MY ABILITY TO SHARES. I ALSO HAVE A SON WITH EPILEPSY AND MULTIPLE DISABILITIES. MEANING HE REQUIRES VERY SPECIALIZED CARE FIRST FROM SOMEONE TRAINED TO RESPOND TO HIS CONDITION ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS NOT. A BIG TURNOVER. I GET -- THE CHILD CARE FROM FOR SERIOUS I HAVE HAD MY DOCTOR FILL OUT AN INCAPACITATION FORM IS WHICH I CALL QUALIFIED -- FOR YEARS NOW IT IS NOT THE PROBLEM OF IT JUST BEING CERTIFIED IT'S THE FACT IT. THE FORCES DECIDED THAT THE INFORMATION A DOCTOR PROVIDED ABOUT MY ILLNESS WAS NO LONGER COLETTE AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR BOARD REQUESTED SPECIFIC CHRONIC UP MIGHT INFORMATION. ON WHICH I FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO BE TRAINED THROUGH THE HIPAA LAW BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL LAW. ENFORCING SKILLS THAT THEY ARE ABOVE THE FEDS. AND MY DOCTOR IN MANY OCCASIONS HAVE TO PERSONALLY CONTACT THEM BECAUSE I WAS JUST NOT ABLE TO GO TO MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS I HAVE. HEART PROBLEMS I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND THEY ASK WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE. IT'S BECAUSE FOUR SCENES DIDN'T PROVIDE ME WITH DAY CARE AND THEY WANT IT SPECIFIC SO AS AN AS AN ATM THAT I DON'T HAVE IF I DID HAVE AIDS IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS THAT I WOULD HAVE AIDS OR CANCER ANYTHING. IT'S MY PERSONAL THING AND IF I DIE WHEN YOU SAYS I'M DEEMED DISABLED WHICH I HAVE BEEN. FOR A LONG TIME AND HAVE GOTTEN WORSE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE STRESS AND THE LACK OF ME BEING ABLE TO GET SERVICES I MEAN PROVIDE GET MY SERVICES THAT. ALLOW ME TO GO TO DOCTORS AND NOT SHOW UP WITH ALL THESE. YOU KNOW KIDS. SHOW THAT HE TOOK IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND EVEN TALK TO THE STATE. COMPLAINT PEOPLE THAT I DID THE THE PILL FOR AND FORESEES STILL TO THIS DAY REQUIRES SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION COLETTE IS STILL IN. FORESEE SHE'S JUST DEMOTED FROM HER POSITION AND FOUND ANOTHER FANCY TITLE -- AYE KEEN. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IT FORESEES AGENTS FOR ME IS NOT LETTING ME -- THEY'RE JUST BLOWING ME IN MY FAMILY -- THEY TRIED TO TO TERMINATE ME MANY MANY TIMES -- AND LIKE I SAID MY DOCTORS HAVE TRIED TO HELP ME OUT BUT IT'S NEVER GOOD ENOUGH THEY WANT SPECIFICS AND I'M NOT GOING TO RELEASE SPECIFIC IN DEMEANOR. MY OWN PERSONAL HEALTH TO SUIT THE FANCY PEOPLE SITTING HERE. I'M. I TRY TO DETERMINE MY CHILD CARE AND STOPPING -- MIGHT DAYS THEY'D STOP PAY MY PROVIDER THAT WAS A EXAM PROVIDER AND DIDN'T PAY HIM FOR CLOSE TO ALMOST A YEAR. OF THE ONLY PAY THEM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND WHICH IN THAT FACT HE HAD LOST HIS [inaudible] ME ANYMORE. BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING SPECIFIC FOR MY SON WITH ME MEDICAL DISABILITIES AN EPILEPTIC I'M. I GUESS THAT WAS THE COMPASSION THAT HE COULDN'T JUST STOP WATCHING ESPECIALLY. THE ONE I HAD A LOT OF CONDITIONS BECAUSE HE KNEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M AND WITH HOPES THAT. THEY WITH THEY WERE GOING TO PAY HIM AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS COME UP WITH DIFFERENT REASONS OF WHY NOT -- I HAVE AN OPEN CONTRACT WITH FORESEES RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE YMCA THAT. FORESEES ONLY MANDATED ME TO PICK THE YMCA. I'M WHICH LIKE I SAID I CAN'T USE FOR MY TWO CHILDREN BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE ALSO HAS A DISABILITY BUT NOT AS CHRONIC AS MY EPILEPTIC SON. AND AS YOU KNOW COURSES TURNOVERS ARE BIG AND MY SON REQUIRES STAY STATEN WHICH IS AN EMERGENCY ONE BECAUSE HE GOES ON CONSCIENCE WITH THOSE OF EPILEPSY. AND IT'S TIME CENSORED SO YOU HAVE TO BE TRAINED AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GOES ON THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT TRAINED WHICH IS WHY I NEED AN EXACT PROVIDER. IN HOME BECAUSE THINGS THE WHEN HE FALLS HE FALLS WE DON'T KNOW HE'S LIKE ASAN ANDREAS. CRACK THEIR AND FOUR SEASONS NO COMPASSION NO EMPATHY THE VERY CALLOUS TO MY NEEDS AND I DON'T HAVE THE FIFTY BUCKS THAT IT REQUIRES TO PAY THE KOBE. OF OF THE YMCA BECAUSE IT ONLY COVERS SO MUCH NOR DID I HAVE THE MONEY IT REQUIRED FOR LIKE A FAMILY FOR YEARS SOME KIND OF FEE THAT DOESN'T GET COVERED UNDER LIKE A SUBSIDIZED. I REQUEST FOR A GRANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SCHOLARSHIP I BELIEVE IS WHAT IT WAS CALLED. AND EVEN AT MY SON'S SCHOOL THE TEACHERS THE AIDS TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I MEAN HE'S BROKEN IS WRIST HE'S GONE UNCONSCIOUS HE'S HAD SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS. THAT THEY'VE STARTED TO PROVIDE HIM WITH THE ONE ON ONE NEEDS FOR LUNCHEON RECESS. AND FORESEES DOESN'T UNDERSTAND OR TAKE ANY OF THIS IN CONSIDERATION. I'M SO MY REQUEST WOULD BE TO HAVE THEM. TRAINED IN THE HIPAA LAWS THROUGH THE FED. AND ALSO -- I ALSO WANT TO RAISE THE CONCERN THAT WE HEARD. THERE PEOPLE SEE A AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DIDN'T FIND ANY OF THEM DEFICIENCIES THEM SOUTH PROBABLY PROBLEMS DO NOT JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER AM. ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S HOW THE OVERSIGHT EVERY OVERSEE EVERYTHING AND IT DISAPPOINTMENT. DISAPPOINTS ME THAT THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND NOT FINING FINDINGS AND SO MANY WRONGFUL THINGS. AND IT MAKES ME REALLY WONDER IF THEY'RE DOING LIKE WHAT THE BOARD AT FOUR SEE IN ALL OF THE CEO THAT PEOPLE USE TO HAVE.

THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME AND SPEAK TO US WHO REALLY APPRECIATED. WE REALIZES IS NOT ALWAYS THE AN EASY THING TO DO AND CAN SOMEWHAT BE INTIMIDATING SETTING SO FOR FOLKS WHO TAKE THE TIME TO COME WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU DOING SO [inaudible] NEXT. ARE GOING NEXT. HI THERE MY NAME IS ANA RODRIGUEZ AND I AM A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER. I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW MUCH LOVE DEDICATION AND HARD WORK IT TAKES TO PROVIDE THEM POINT CARE THAT FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON OUR PROFESSION IS ALSO CHALLENGING. WORKING WITH CHILDREN IS WONDERFUL REWARDING AND CHALLENGING. AND STRESSFUL ALL AT ONCE. THAT THAT PROBABLY ISN'T A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. BUT WHAT MANY DON'T KNOW IS HOW DIFFICULT BEING A CHILD PROVIDER CAN BE WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO WORK WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL AND HOW STYLE AGENCY. SADLY WITH THE JAY THAT AUDIT DISCOVERED ABOUT FORESEES MISMANAGEMENT IS NOT AN UNCOMMON STORY. FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ACROSS. OUR UNION AVE FACED SIMILAR ISSUES. FORCES IS NOT AN EXCEPTION. THAT IS WHY OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; AND FAMILY&lt;/c&gt;</u> CHILDCARE AGENCIES. THESE PROBLEMS ARE MADE EVEN WORSE BY THE LACK OF A MEANINGFUL APPEALS PROCESS FOR PARENTS AND PROVIDERS. WHEN AGENCIES LIKE FORCED FEES MAKE ONE SIDED DECISIONS TO TERMINATE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE? PARENTS OFTEN HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR CHILDREN? WHAT AGENCIES LIKE FORESEES I'M SORRY. IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A HEALTHY FUNCTIONING FAMILY CHILDCARE SYSTEM WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE APPEALS PROCESS FOR DECISIONS BY CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> AGENCIES ALIKE. WE NEED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR CHILDCARE PROVIDERS SO THAT WE CAN BE STRONG ADVOCATES. FOR THE CHILDREN WE CARE. FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS LATELY KNOWS THE DANGERS THAT CHILDREN FACE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE STRONG ADVOCATES TO SPEAK UP FOR THEM. AND GUARD THEIR SAFETY. THIS AUDIT THIS AUDIT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; CAN'T BE&lt;/c&gt;</u> TRUSTED TO AFFECTED EFFECTIVELY. OVERSEE FAMILY CHILDCARE ON THEIR OWN. FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. MUST HAVE A VOICE. I AM HERE TODAY AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER TO TELL YOU THAT THE RIGHT FOR US. TO NEGOTIATE A UNION CONTRACT IS CRUCIAL FOR FIXING OUR BROKEN CHILDCARE SYSTEM. IT IS HOW WE GUARANTEE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT ONLY GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE. BUT ALSO TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE DISRUPTION. AND MISMANAGED MISMANAGEMENT OF AGENCIES [inaudible] LIKE FORESEES. IT IS HOW WE IT IS HOW WE FIGHT POVERTY THOUGHT OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE THAT OUR COMMUNITY SPACE. AND SPEAK UP FOR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND ON THE BOARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEN THINK NEXT SIR PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME OF THE YOU DON'T FOLLOW FROM MAYBE NOT -- UNEMPLOYED YOU FOR FEE FOR A FIGURE. AND HE TOOK A BREATH OF SOME CONFIRMED I HAVE -- BIPARTISAN MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH. ARE DOING DIFFICULT IF I HAVE A FEELING I'M GOING TO OUR MEN OF USES AT THE AGE OF MUCH OF WHAT PREFERMENT LIKE YOU WERE OFTEN. RETALIATION FOURTH WE CANNOT A MANAGEMENT MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS LIKE AND STUFF SILENT TREATMENT. ARE WE HOLDEN REFILL FOR OF RESOURCES ON INFORMATION REQUIRED TO DO THE JOB HARSH CRITICISM. SETTING UP FOR FAILURE. DON'T TAKE IN A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION -- TENDENCIES TO PLAY OF FAVORITISM. UNDER DON'T UP LEFT OF ARE UNDERPAID -- CD FOR FIRMS WILL HAVE FAILED TO LIVE AND TO US YOU ARE THINK TO MISTER BELL ON MISTER -- ICE. THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO THE GET TO THESE ARE THE FORMALWEAR AT DO IF ALTERNATIVE BRIDGE RIVER OF DARK TAXPAYERS MONEY HOW THE AGENCY. OF WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW ARE HELD THE BENEFITS. I HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. SO WE HAVE NO A BENEFIT RIGHT NOW -- YET THEY'VE MONEY [inaudible] TO PAY EXPENSIVE ATTORNEYS. BUT NOT IN THE FINAL BENEFITS WE HAVE NO BENEFIT RIGHT NOW -- WE NEED LEADERSHIP WE NEED INTEGRITY ON NOT NOT THAT THEY WERE SHIPPED AROUND THINKING THING. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED AND IF WHAT WE ARE ASKING [inaudible] FOR LEADERSHIP [inaudible] A WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THESE THE TO MAKE SURE WE COME FROM FULFILL THE MISSION OF HELPING CHILDREN. PERRANCE A PROVIDER. ARE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT OUR STAFF MEMBER [inaudible] THANK YOU. I KNOW RETALIATION PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SIR I WILL BE BRIEF. YOU KNOW I MIGHT OF THAT BECAUSE THE UNITED BEEN -- I WAS WITH YOU JUST TWENTY YEARS AS A SUBSIDY. CASE MANAGER AND I WITNESSED MANY QUESTIONABLE. ACTIONS BY THE PART OF MANAGEMENT TO AND WHEN I CHOSE TO SPEAK UP BLOW THE WHISTLE AND PUSH FOR UNION REPRESENTATION AYE WE SUBSEQUENTLY FIRED. I NOW WORK FOR SEIU LOCAL FIVE TWO WHAT DID JOE I DID NOT GET AN EXIT REVIEW I WAS PLACED ON PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE IN APRIL. OUR WHEN I SPOKE UP AGAINST THE AGAINST THE AGENCY APRIL OF WHAT YEARS -- APRIL OF LAST YEAR [inaudible] AND THE SO I SPOKE UP AT THE BUSH SENATOR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ABOUT THE INJUSTICES THAT WERE GOING ON I WAS PAID I WAS PUT ON PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. AND IN AUGUST I WAS FIRED BY EMAIL DID YOUR INJUSTICES INCLUDE THE BACKDATING. NOPE BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT ACTED IT WAS COMMON A PRACTICE AND UNDER SUPER. NOW ACTUALLY WITH MANAGEMENT SAW DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ACTED NOTICES OF ACTION BECAUSE IT WANTED TO REMAIN COMPLIANT WITH CD. SO WE DID THAT. FOR ALL THOSE THINGS AYE AYE WELL THAT WAS PART OF THE THE PROCESS. AND IS THE SENIOR CASE MANAGER FORESEES AYE WITNESSES MANY ABUSES THAT THE MAJOR ADVANTAGE RED HAT CONDUCTED. AT THE AGENCY NOW THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IS VERY THOROUGH AND I BELIEVE IT IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AND I ALSO BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY MORE AREAS WHERE FORESEES HAS FAILED PARENTS. PROVIDERS EMPLOYEES AND TAXPAYERS AND WHAT VALENTINA SAID WAS RIGHT THERE THE WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT NOW AT THE FORCE HE COUNSELED WITH REGARDS AND MANAGEMENT IS NOT DO MANAGEMENT THE ONLY NEW MANAGER. IS -- JOE MATT AROUND THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE IT'S THE VEHICLE LET COULDN'T WHOSE. SO WHAT IS NOW THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER WAS. THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR MANY YEARS. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD. HAS BEEN THERE FOR DECADES. AND ALL THEY DID WAS SHIFT PEOPLE AROUND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THESE NEW MANAGEMENT THERE REALLY ISN'T. AND I LIKE I SAID I WILL BE BRIEF NOT ONLY THAT THE AUDIT POINT TO FORCE THESE DEFICIENCIES IT ALSO ADDRESSES THOSE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO MONITOR WHAT THE CONTRACT AS OPPOSED TO BE DOING. IDEA I GET A HOLD OF EIGHTY EIGHT CONTRACT DOT CASES ARE FILES OF CONTRACTED AGENCY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT HE IS HE AYE YOU REQUESTED. I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THEM OVER AND OVER LOOKING AT THEM. AND WHAT I FOUND THAT THE IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN. A LOT OF THOSE -- EIGHTY EIGHT THERE WERE VERY FEW THAT WERE BASICALLY TERMINATED IN ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF THAT CD IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE A CONTRACTING AGENCY THAT'S BECAUSE THE VIOLATED. HALF OF THE THIRTEEN HER REASONS FOR IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. THE OTHER ONES SEEM TO BE ON A DEFAULT MODE THAT THE THAT THE CITY USES WHICH IS. TO BASICALLY BUT I'M BY NO OFFER OF A CONTINUED FUND THE THEN THE GOTO PANEL REVIEW THE BATTERY OF YOU THEY SENT THOUGH THERE WERE CHANGE STORE SAID. OKAY WE'RE GONNA PUT UNCONDITIONAL STATUS THEN THEY PUT AMONG CONDITIONAL STATUS AND THEN THE CYCLE GOES AND THEN AT THE END WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEM AND THEY SAY WELL DID YOU DO IF WE TOLD YOU TO DO AND THEY LOOK AT THE ADDENDUM. THAT IS WHY YOU THINK QUITE TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU YOU SUPPOSED TO DO BUT YOU DID SOME OF THEM. SO GUESS WHAT WE TO PUT ON ANOTHER CONDITIONAL [inaudible] CONTRACT STATUS. AND THEN THEY GO BUT LOOK AT IT AGAIN AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND ACCORDING TO THE SPOT THAT WAS LOOKING AT AND THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU GET THAT SOME OF THEM BUT WE FOUND SOME OTHER ONES SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE. PUT YOU ON THERE WERE SOME THERE WERE LIKE SIX YEARS INTO CONDITIONAL CONTRACT STATUS AND SOME OF THESE AGENCIES OWED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO THE CD IT'S STILL THE CONTINUE TO BE UNCONDITIONAL CONTRACT STATUS. SO WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THAT THE CD HAS OPTED TO PLACE FORCES ON A CONDITIONAL CONTRACTS THAT IS NOW OR FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. OF THE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FORESEES SHOWS THE MOST IF IT'S SO THE MOST MINIMAL INDICATION OF EFFORT. THE CD WILL PLACE IT ON ANOTHER CONDITIONALS THAT FOR THAT NOT THE NEXT YEAR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR FOR FOR ALL OTHER READ THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY -- FORESEES BUT ALSO THIS CD MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS AND THE PROVISION OF QUALITY SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT SIR MANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. COLOR ANY CLOSING REMARKS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR ATTENTIVENESS I'M THIS MORNING AS YOU INDICATED. MYSELF AND SENATOR ABOUT. EVEN OUR JURISDICTION UMMM YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A KEEN INTEREST US BUT I APPRECIATE YOU FOR ALSO INTERESTED COMMITTEE FOR THEIR INTEREST -- AND I YOU KNOW LOOK. THIS THIS AUDIT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE <u>&lt;c.green&gt; DID AGAIN --&lt;/c&gt;</u> CONFIRM SOME. SUSPICIONS AND AND THINGS ARE BEING TOLD US CERTAINLY TO MYSELF AND SENATOR ABOUT. I DO ALSO THINK THAT IT EXPOSES AND THERE IN MY OPINION. OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OF A BETTER OVERSIGHT BY CITY I I THINK THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW -- AND THIS TO BEGIN TO DEBATE TO HAPPEN TO BE CONTAINED HAPPENED AND AT THIS CONDITIONAL STATUS YOU KNOW BUT IS THAT. HOW TO BE HAVE OUTCOME FROM CONDITIONAL STATUS THAT MAKES SENSE GOING FORWARD THAT ACTUALLY HAS ACCOUNTABILITY ATTACHED TO AND? I IMAGINE I THINK TO MYSELF CENTER BELL WILL BE DISCUSSING MONTHS OURSELVES -- BUT HADN'T THEY WITH THEIR SIDE OF THE APPEAL PROCESS OR OTHER AREAS WHERE SEE VERY APPEALS OF IT MAY BE ADEQUATE OF YOU MAY HAVE A DIVERSE OPINION AND AND AND ME M. -- BRING SOMETHING FORWARD IN THAT REGARD -- AND THE LASTING ALL SAY -- AS I THE HEARING SIDE STEPPED OUT OF A WATCH THE VIDEO FOR THEIR AT THE PORTIONS I STEPPED OUT. OF THEM IS THAT YOU KNOW SPECIAL ON A DAY LIKE TODAY OR SUPREME COURT JUST STRUCK A MAJOR BLOW -- TO WORKERS -- IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT'S AT THAT THERE'S THAT. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS THAT WORKERS CAN'T FEEL FREE TO COME FORWARD -- IT'S A COMMON REFRAIN THAT. HAS BEEN HEARD FOR YEARS NOW. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ONLY UNACCEPTABLE. WITH ANY. ORGANIZATION THAT HAS A CULTURE OF INTEGRITY. ALBUM BUT IT'S ILLEGAL. AND AND IF THAT PATTERN. IS SHOWN TO HAVE CONTINUED IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM AND SO -- IN HIGH WILL. NO IT'S ALWAYS ALLOW FOLKS OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE TO BE BETTER TO GET BETTER -- THAT THAT'S PART OF OF OF BEING RESPONSIBLE IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP IS TO ALLOW FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT IT HAS TO BE SINCERE AND HAS BEEN DONE. CLEARLY TRANSPARENTLY -- WITH EMPOWERMENT OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED INCLUDING THE WORKERS INCLUDING THE FAMILIES A DAY NEED TO BE EMPOWERED TO THIS PROCESS I HAVEN'T. HEARD ANY SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN AT OF ACTUALLY EMPOWERED THOSE THAT HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST. AND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR ONCE AGAIN -- I APPRECIATE THE AUDITOR'S FOR THEIR WONDERFUL WORK AND YOU'LL BE CERTAIN DE TO HEAR MORE. OF FROM US IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. WELL ON BEHALF OF MY CHAIR I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE VERY VERY INFORMATIVE -- DISCUSSION TODAY. I COME TO THIS SORT OF NEW TO THE PROCESS MY COLLEAGUE AT THE PROCESS BUT THE ISSUE MY COLLEAGUES ARE CERTAINLY MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT THAN I AM AS EVIDENCED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR QUESTIONS. OF THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT -- THIS ISSUE OF THE APPLICATION OF STATES FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS HERE IS IS FAIRLY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE USED AS INTENDED THEN THAT IS TO PROVIDE LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE. AND MORE PARTICULARLY THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE THESE FUNDS. THAT IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WE INSTILL A CULTURE [inaudible] OF WHERE. INTEGRITY IS VALUED AND IN FACT IS PLACED AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE ORGANIZATION -- WITH REGARD TO THIS BACKDATING WHICH YOU CAN TELL US FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE TO ME. A IN GENERAL AND IN SPECIFIC AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IN THE AUDIT WE SORT OF DANCED AROUND THE ISSUE A BIT WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME IN AN OVERSIGHT [inaudible] HEARING. WE DIDN'T SERVE. GO INTO THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION THAT THE ORGANIZATION I HOPE CONDUCTED AND DOCUMENTED. WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THE PERSONS IN THE POSITIONS INVOLVED IN SO. PACIFIC WE ISCUSS PERSONS IN POSITIONS INVOLVED. IN THE BACK DATING WE DIDN'T DISCUSS PARTICULAR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS -- TAKEN IN THESE CASES WHICH I HOPE WERE TAKEN AND I HOPE WERE DOCUMENTED IN. APPROPRIATE EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL FILES WE DID ATTEMPT TO DIG DOWN VERIFY THAT THE PERSONS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE BACKDATING. I ACTUALLY HAVE DEPARTED THE ORGANIZATION HOPEFULLY AND IN SOME SORT OF DEFINITIVE WAY. AS HAS BEEN ALLEGED DID NOT OCCUR -- SO. I CAN ONLY SAY THOSE ISSUES AND I JUST HIGHLIGHTED. IT'S CERTAINLY BE OF INTEREST TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND THE NEW INTERIM CEO AND FRANKLY SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS YOU CONDUCT YOUR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING. EFFORTS OF THIS ORGANIZATION. SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I GUESS IF WE COME BACK TO THIS ISSUE IN THE FUTURE AND IF I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ASSUMING THE ROLE OF MY CHAIR AND OVERSIGHT HEARING YOU CAN PROBABLY ANTICIPATES A MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECTS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. HAVING SAID ALL THAT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES. FOR HELPING ME WITH THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING OUT SPECIFICALLY WANT TO THANK OUR ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR INNER STAFF FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY HAVE MADE TO THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING THIS AUDIT AND IN GENERAL TO THE OPERATION OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT.
