SHOP FOR WITH BECAUSE MR MOMENTS IN THE HOUSE YOU HAVE A A. B.. THIRTY ONE TEN TO. PLEASE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. OKAY. SURE PLEASE THANK YOU. THERE. YEAH I NEVER. THEN CAME THE. VERY WIDE AND. WHICH ESTABLISHES BE ATHLETIC TRADE PRACTICE. LICENSES. AND REGULATIONS PERPETRATORS. HE ATHLETIC TRAINER LICENSING COMMITTEE. WITHIN A CALIFORNIA MORE. THERE. CALIFORNIA IS THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT. NOT REGULARLY FASHION. GREAT. ANDERSON WHITE LINES SKILL OF SKELETAL ISSUES LIKE DISLOCATIONS AND FRACTURES. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WITH AN ACCREDITED ATHLETIC TRAINING EDUCATION PROGRAM. THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO OBTAIN NATIONAL ATHLETIC TRAINING CERTIFICATION THROUGH THE BOARD OF CERTIFICATION. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE. OR EDUCATION HIGHER THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. A RECENT CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION SURVEY OF ATHLETIC DIRECTORS WITH APPROXIMATELY NINETY PERCENT RESPONSE RATE. INDICATES THAT THERE AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HIGH SCHOOLS CURRENTLY EMPLOYING AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS PRACTICING AS AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING? THIS MEANS THAT YOUNG ATHLETES ARE UNKNOWINGLY UNDER THE CARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO LACKEY EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO ACT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. BECAUSE THERE'S NO LICENSING BOARD. OR COMMITTEE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO ACCURATE. SYSTEMIC WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT EVIDENCE OF HARM AGAINST ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE THOSE POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND HAVE THOSE REPORTS INVESTIGATED WERE TRACKED. THERE IS ONLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE. AB THIRTY ONE TEN ALSO PROTECTS THE EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND ATHLETIC TRAINERS THEMSELVES. CURRENTLY ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHO'VE OBTAIN THE PROPER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PRACTICE IN A LEGAL GRAY AREA. WHICH PLACES THEM AT INCREASED RISK OF LIABILITY. EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN SECTORS SUCH AS EDUCATION. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND INDUSTRIES ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NO STATE SANCTIONED SCOPE OF PRACTICE TO DELINEATE. WHAT ATHLETIC TRADERS CAN AND CANNOT DO? IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY PROFESSIONALS THESE EMPLOYERS HIRE WHO ARE NOT LICENSE. THIS CREATES A LACK OF CERTAINTY THAT INCREASES THE EMPLOYERS RISK OF LIABILITY. ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN SOME SETTINGS ESPECIALLY IN COLLEGIATE AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND PERFORMING ARTS. ARE REQUIRED TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AS PART OF DOING THEIR JOB. IN A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES IT IS ILLEGAL FOR UNREGULATED ATHLETIC TRAINERS TO PRACTICE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME IN THEIR STATE. WHEN AT WHEN CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS TRAVEL OF THOSE STATES WITH. THEIR TEAMS ARE THERE COMPANIES THEY RISK VIOLATING THOSE STATE LAWS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REGULATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY ANYONE CAN ACT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY EDUCATION IN ATHLETIC TRAINING. WERE OUR NATIONALLY ACCREDITED. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MIKE JEWS ARE THE CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT I'M GOING TO START. WITH TERRY MCCALEB LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON THE BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN REGAN ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION. OF THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE THEIR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. AS CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES. AND TO A PERFORMED THEIR DUTIES IN TAKING CARE OF HONORABLE ATHLETES. OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE THEY PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. A YOU REQUESTED AN AMENDMENT WE TOOK THAT AMENDMENT AND THAT IS THE BILL THAT IS PRESENT. BEFORE YOU TODAY. I IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPLY THEM. A WITH THE NEW MEDIA STORIES HIGHLIGHTING THE PROBLEMS THAT TAKE PLACE. WHEN ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE NOT PRESENT. AND THOSE WHO SUFFER BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THERE. I RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT OVER THE YEARS THERE'S THE QUESTION OF SCOPE. AND WHERE ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE GOING TO FIT IN. OUR WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST IS THAT WE WENT TO THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN. AND WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND WE SPOKE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION YESTERDAY AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SPOKEN TO COMMITTEE STAFF. AND HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM AND WE WORK WORK CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT IS HERE TODAY. THIS BILL IS OVERDUE IT'S TIME FOR THE ATHLETES PLEASE LET'S GET IT DONE. I AM PLEASED INTRODUCED MIKE TO CZAR. MARCHES ARE IS AN EDUCATOR AND HE IS A TRAINER. AND HAS BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE PROMULGATION OF THIS LEGISLATION. A GOOD MORNING. A COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF STAFF THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B.. THREE ONE ONE ZERO. AND AS TERRY MENTIONED THIS IS BILLS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO AB FIFTEEN TEN WHICH PASS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND WOOD IS TERRY SAID WE MODIFY. SOME LANGUAGE AND BY RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM YOUR COMMITTEE. WE ALSO LOOKED AT AND RECOMMEND DACIANS AND SUGGESTIONS INCORPORATED THOSE FROM THE OTP WARDEN OTHERS. AND THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED ATHLETIC TRAINERS PRACTICING A VARIETY OF SETTINGS A CALIFORNIA. FROM CORPORATE INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS LIKE DISNEYLAND AT AMAZON. POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS HOSPITALS CLINICS PHYSICIANS OFFICES. AND EVEN TRADITIONAL ATHLETIC TRAINING SETTINGS LIKE PROFESSIONAL TEAMS COLLEGES. UNIVERSITIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS. AND WE HAVE A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL FROM MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER GROUPS. CATHOLIC CONFERENCE'S UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES THE CIF. AND THEY ALL SHARE A COMMON VISION OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THESE GROUPS ROLLING BY THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUED LACK OF LICENSURE POSE A RISK TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR TRAINING SERVICES. INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THAT OF YOUNG ATHLETES UNKNOWINGLY RELIANT UNQUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF HARM THAT HAVE OCCURRED YOUNG ATHLETES. IN THESE SITUATIONS. THAT MR IMAGINE THERE'S A RESTROOM PORTERS AND ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND ILLEGAL GRAY AREA THAT WE WORK IN. AND WE APPRECIATE THE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT OF ATHLETIC TRAINING. FROM A NUMBER OF OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND THE WILLINGNESS OF COMMITTEE STAFF OF TO ENGAGE ON LANGUAGE AND AND OUR INTENT IS TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A STRONG. BILL THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC FROM UNQUALIFIED UNEDUCATED PRACTITIONERS. AND PROTECT ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND EMPLOYERS FROM UNNECESSARY LIABILITY. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LEILANI ACTING OUT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ERIKA ROMERO BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING THE PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFITS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JANET LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING BOB MAILER REPRESENTING STANFORD UNIVERSITY SUPPORT. A SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. CALL UP THE. OPPOSITION WITNESSES POLICE MORNING MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS CARL LONDON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. HAS MAKE JUST A COUPLE OF VERY BRIEF COMMENTS. ABOUT THE BILL AND THEN ASK OUR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHRIS READ. TWO. BRING THE BALL COURT TESTIMONY CHRISS. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IS AS BOTH AN ATHLETIC TRAINER AND A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. WE OPPOSE THE BILL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHICH WINNER LETTER ONE WE BELIEVE IT LICENSURE IS UNNECESSARY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE. PASS SCHEMES THAT WERE PASSED IN PRIOR BILLS THEY GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THAT INCLUDED TOTAL PROTECTION. AND. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WOULD BE. A OKAY FOR HANDLING ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL DESPITE THE RHETORIC OF SUPPORT. REALLY RELATES TO ATHLETES. ATHLETIC TRAINING OR SPORTS DESPITE THOSE BEING THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENTS AND WITHOUT ALTERNATE OVER TO CHRIS WHO. AGAIN IS A BOTH AN ATHLETIC TRAINER IN A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND CHAIR OF OUR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK CARL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE OPTIMISTIC YOUR DAY. MY NAME IS CHRIS FREEDOM GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR. OF THE CALIFORNIA FISCAL THEIR POSITION ON THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND SURVIVE ATHLETIC TRAINER AND I RISE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE TEN. THIS BILLS UNNECESSARY DOES LITTLE TO TRULY PROTECT THERE'S OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSE THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE RATHER TRAINERS THERE IS OVERLY BROAD. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL CONVENIENTLY USE THE ARGUMENT THAT ATHLETES ARE SAFER WHEN A CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINERS ON THE SIDELINES. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL THE SIDELINES IS IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR ATHLETES. HOWEVER THIS LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ATHLETES SPORTS SPORTS TEAMS OR SPORTS VENUES. INSTEAD IT CREATES A NEW BATTERIES LEVELHEALTH CARE PROVIDER WITH THE FREEDOM TO WORK WITH ANY PERSON FOR NEARLY ANY CONDITION WITH ESSENTIALLY NO OVERSIGHT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO PROVE PROVE THE NECESSITY FOR LICENSURE THE FUNDS OF AB THIRTY WHAT. THIRTY ONE TEN HAVE CLAIMED THAT CALIFORNIA MUST LICENSE ATHLETIC TRAINERS SINKING TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES FOR THEIR SPORTS TEAMS LEGALLY. AND REVIEW OF THE FIFTY OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT REGULAR ATHLETIC TRAINERS IT TURNS OUT FORTY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS ALLOWING ATHLETIC TRAINER CERTIFIED BY THE BOARD CERTIFICATION AND TRAVELING WITH ATHLETIC TEAM IN THAT STATE. TO PRACTICE OUT THERE TRYING. A CALIFORNIA BASED AUTHOR TRAINER CONCURRENTLY LEGALLY TRAVEL TO INFORM AUTHOR TRAIN SERVICES IN ANY OF THE OTHER TEN STATES BY OBTAINING A LICENSE AND THAT STATE. JUST AS ANY OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OBLIGATED TO. IT SEEMS TO US THAT IT'S NOT THE CALVIN LEGISLATORS JOB TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WORKING LEGALLY IN ANOTHER STATE. RATHER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS IN OUR STATE. LETS LOOK AT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION COMPONENTS OF THE BILL. AB THIRTY ONE TEN BECAUSE OUR POSITION OVERSIGHT OF AN ATHLETIC TRAINER THERE IS FAR MORE LENIENT THAN THAT OF OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS. WHO HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF EDUCATION TRAINING THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW NOTHING TRYING TO TREAT A PATIENT FOR AN INJURY OR ILLNESS FOR UNRESTRICTED AMOUNT OF TIME WITHOUT THE PIGEON EVER HAVING TO SEE A POSITION? AS LONG AS A PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE AUTHOR TRAINER IN A POSITION HAS OCCURRED AT SOME POINT TIME. THIS LEVEL POSITION OVERSIGHT IS VASTLY MORE LENIENT IN ATHLETIC TRAINING. FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS ABOUT HIS LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THAN WHAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORIZED VISITS ASSISTANCE OR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE OR FOR A PHYSICAL THERAPIST WITH A DOCTOR'S DEGREE. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ALSO ARGUE THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE UNQUALIFIED. AS DID EARLIER WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT HAVING A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ON THE SIDELINES IS IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR ATHLETES. LICENSURE IS NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT PUBLIC THOUGH. PROVIDING PROTECTION OF THE TITLE CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER BY ALLOWING ONLY THOSE OBSERVATION FROM THE BOARD OF CERTIFICATION FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS THE GOLD STANDARD AFTER TRAIN PROFESSION. WOULD ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE WITH THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION TRAINING OR HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS OUT THERE TRYING TO CALIFORNIA. THIS ALONE IS A REASONABLE SOLUTION THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE CALIFORNIA. JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE REPORT ON ATHLETIC TRAINER REGULATIONS ONE PASSED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ON THREE PRIOR OCCASIONS AND ONE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION ON EACH OF THOSE OCCASIONS. FINALLY WE ARE CURIOUS WHAT IS THE VOID THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO RESOLVE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY SEVERAL LICENSE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS WHO ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE TO BY THE TYPE OF CARE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ATHLETIC TRAINERS TO FORM. IN EVERY CASE THE OTHER TRAIN HAS A LOWER EDUCATIONAL STANDARD AND YET WOULD BE AUTHORIZED OF A MUCH BROADER SCOPE UNDER THIS BILL. AB THIRTY ONE TEN IS A HIGHLY FLAWED AND ON THE NECESSARY BILL I STRONGLY URGE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN IN THE OPPOSITION AND CAST A VOTE OF NO TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A THE MORNING MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS IVAN ALL TOMORROW I REPRESENT THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I WILL I WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN MYSELF. AND MY CLIENTS. WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MIKE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PHYSICAL A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. AND. LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THAT OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND AOTI A. ON HAVE IN THE PAST WORKED WITH ATHLETIC TRAINERS ON THIS ISSUE FOR THEM WE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM IN THE PAST ON. ON. TITLE PROTECTION AND CERTIFICATION BILLS WE HAVE WORKED WITH HIM IN THE PAST WHEN THEY HAVE. BROUGHT UP A SCOPE BILLS. BUT AB THIRTY ONE TEN IS. THIS YEAR'S VERSION AS WELL AS LAST YEAR'S ARE BILL FIFTEEN OF FIFTEEN TEN. HAS PROVISIONS IN IT THAT ARE A. PROBLEMATIC FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND THAT IS THAT THEY. THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS WOULD LIKE TO PUT THEIR THEIR SELVES UNDER THE BOARD CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. WE VIEW THIS AS A VERY PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EDUCATION TRAINING. OF FIELD WORK REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE DIFFERENT PATIENT OUTCOMES. WE DO NOT SEE A SYNERGY BETWEEN ATHLETIC TRAINING AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. AND I QUITE FRANKLY LAST YEAR OF THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FEE INCREASE THAT WAS IMPOSED ON ALL ARM OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND LICENSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR A UNDER THE GUISE THAT THE. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE NEEDED JUST TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD OF THE OVERSIGHT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE FOCUS FOR THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. NEEDS TO BE ON OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS. WE THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IF THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS A CONTINUE TO SEEK A LICENSURE VERSUS A TITLE PROTECTION CERTIFICATION THAT THEY SHOULD. THEY SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE THEIR OWN BOARD PERHAPS. BE UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD SINCE THEY REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION IN THEIR OWN BILL. BUT WE JUST DO NOT FEEL THAT THE BOOK. THEIR FEARS IS WHERE THEY SHOULD BE ARM WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH WITH SCOPE AS WELL BUT I WON'T REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. I WOULD JUST COMMENT ON ONE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN. IN SUPPORT IN REGARDS TO. THE NEED FOR HAVING ATHLETIC TRAINERS AT HIGH SCHOOLS AND SPORTING EVENTS WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT THAT IS A DIFFERENT. ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED THAT ISN'T THAT. IS THE ISSUE OF HAVING AN ATHLETIC TRAINER AVAILABLE AT SPORTING EVENTS IS A GOOD ISSUE TO TO HAVE. AS GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE. HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT HOW DO WE MANDATE IT? THAT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION THAT IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL AND THAT'S ONE THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO ENGAGE IN. BUT NOT UNDER THAT NOT NOT IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE HERE THANK YOU. BATHHOUSES CAO THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY MPAS WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE OPPOSITION WHICH HAD A WITH OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS LATE LAST WEEK I'M TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS RELATED TO THE BROADNESS OF THE STATUTORY. LANGUAGE AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT OF COURSE. WHILE WE THINK OUR SUPPORT OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS I'M HAVING A PLACE IN THE TEAM AT THIS POINT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY COULD. TREAT OSEM ON A DAILY BASIS AS AN EXAMPLE ARE OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT BE BEYOND THEIR SCOPE SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE SPONSORS BUT AT THIS POINT WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIRTY ONE TEN. THINKING. PAT WHALEN ELLIS MOST NEVER SEE HERE ON BEHALF OF UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA UNION HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO REPRESENT ABOUT. THIRTY THOUSAND NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AMONG THEM ARE HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS. I TOO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR FOR LATE OPPOSITION I'VE REACHED OUT TO STAFF LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. BUT WE ARE IN OF UP OPPOSITION FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS. FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. YES IS ONLY A COUPLE OF US RIGHT AT THE MOMENT SO I GUESS I'LL START. YEAH THIS IS. THIS HAS SOME HISTORY THIS BILL. WHAT READING READING THAT BILL ONE? THE ANALYSIS OF. THAT AND I AM I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S HERE BUT I THINK REALLY THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ARGUMENTS THOSE A LOT OF THE ARGUMENT GOOD ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK REALLY THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUE THAT I SEE HERE REALLY THIS. SHOULD BE FLUSHED OUT IN BMP. I THINK WHAT I'M GONNA. DO A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AND THIS YOU KNOW. CHALLENGING SITUATION YEARS I'M ONLY OFF THE BUILT THIS POINT RESERVE JUDGMENT FOR THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE FLOOR. TO SEE WHERE THIS BILL GOES BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME WORK AND SOME LATE OPPOSITION THAT'S COME IN THE DATA. HE NOW HAS ME A LITTLE MORE CONCERNED AS WELL ABOUT THIS COUPLE ISSUES BUT. AND RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AUGUST AND I THINK I'LL JUST ON A LEFT TO BUILD THIS PARTICULAR POINT AND LET IT LET IT TO PUBLIC AT THE BNP AND. LET THEM FLUSH IT OUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. ANY OF MISTER SCHER. THANK YOU A PERSON WANTED WITH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS SITE BRAVERY PICKING UP THIS TOPIC. BECAUSE AS I WAS JUST ALLUDED TO THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT TOPIC MOVE THROUGH. LAST YEAR WHEN THIS CAME THROUGH COMMITTEE HAD MENTIONED TO THE VAN AUTHOR THAT I HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT WAS. BEING CONSIDERED BUT I WAS WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT I SIT ON WITH YOU AT BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND SO TODAY. ARE WILLING TO DO THE SAME THING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL. TO MOVE IT FOR BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT CERTAINLY ON THE THE SCOPE ISSUES SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WERE. TO. IN THE HEARING IF THERE'S GONNA BE PROGRESS WE'LL RESERVE FOR MY PERSPECTIVE AT THAT POINT BUT BUT I DO THINK A IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND. HAVE ALL OUR COLLEAGUES TICKET ON I HAVE A LOT OF FUN FATE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU WITH THE CHAIR. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS SINCE I KNOW WE JUST SAW THIS BILL BEFORE. MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER THAT BECAUSE OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE ONLY STATE THAT DOES NOT REGULATE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC TRAINING. SO. WATER THE OTHER STATES DOING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ALL UNIQUE. IN THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT BUT. WISE CALIFORNIA NOT AND. HOW DID YOU KNOW? YOU LOOK THERE IS A A BIT OF A PATCHWORK QUILT I'M GONNA REFER TO DEFER TO MY AYE EXPERT ON THAT CALIFORNIA IS THOUGH WHEN OUT LIAR. COMPARED TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE IN NO REAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE OF ANY. KIND SO WE DO SET OURSELVES APART. WE DISTINGUISH OURSELVES. IN A IN A NEGATIVE WAY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'M GOING ALLOW MIKE'S IS HARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THAT NATIONAL LANDSCAPE OUT LOOKS LIKE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STATES ARE LICENSURE. OVER FORTY I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF TOP OF MY HEAD. BY THINK IT'S FORTY THREE OR FORTY FOUR THERE ARE SEVERAL STATES THAT ARE. CALLED REGISTRATION. OR CERTIFICATION BUT HAVE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF LICENSURE WITHOUT PROTECTION SCOPE OF PRACTICE ABOARD AN INVESTIGATION. MINNESOTA HAS REGISTRATION THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS. OF MOVING TOWARDS LICENSURE AND THEY'VE PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE AND AROUND. IN THE OTHER HOUSE RIGHT NOW. SO MOST STATES AGAIN ARE. LICENSED OR SOMETHING THAT'S AKIN TO LICENSURE. DO YOU SEE THIS I MEAN AS A FIRST STEP. I MEAN. EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW ONE WHO IS BEING SAID IS THEY MEAN THEY THEIR OWN OVERSIGHT THEY MAY NEED. ARM TO DEAL WITH THEY DO NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCOPE ISSUE. I MEAN IS THIS. THE FIRST STEP THAT. YOU SEE WHEN THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY EVOLVE INTO THAT. WELL I DON'T WANT TO. NARROW THE BILL ANYWAY AT THIS POINT I THINK A MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE INDICATED WE WILL BE DELVING DEEP INTO THESE SCOPE THAT DISCUSSIONS AT BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. BAH I A WELCOME A ROBUST A CONVERSATION ON THAT ON HOW WE CAN PROPERLY SET UP THE STRUCTURE. BUT. AT THIS POINT. THE THE BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL. THERAPY IS IS WELCOMING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE US THE OVERSIGHT THE BOARD ITSELF. HOW WE THINK? AND AND THERE IS. A I GUESS A BIT OF A A DOWNSIDE IN THE LONG HISTORY ON THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO. A RECORD OF NOT HAVING SUCCESS IN GETTING IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HAVING AND SIGNED THE BENEFIT IS THERE HAVE BEEN. EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS AND EXPLORATION OF THE FAILED EFFORTS WE THINK WE HAVE THE STRONGEST ARE AND THE AND THE MOST. THOUGHTFUL BILL OUGHT TO PRESENT TO COMMITTEE TODAY WE WILL AYE DEL FLY INTO OTHER SCOPE AT ISSUES GOING FORWARD AND THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY ENTERTAIN THAT DISCUSSION I MOST CERTAINLY WILL BE. INTERESTED IN TALKING WITH ALL OF THE. INTERESTED PARTIES HONEST ON THE BILL. JUST THEM LESLIE YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN AN ATHLETE ALL MY LIFE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. MY SON YOU KNOWN FOOTBALL AND. GOLF NINA VARIOUS SPORTS ON. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WHO MOVE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS. THANK GOD FOR TITLE NINE WE HAD.

YOU KNOW THANK GOODNESS FOOD THAT WHEN MY SON HAD HIS CONCUSSION AND FOOTBALL SO. YOU KNOW I SEE THE THE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT I I THINK THE DISCUSSION IS IMPORTANT SO.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B. TWENTY TWO TWENTY AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT. I MISTER SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE PUT INTO THE MEASURE I WILL. BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU FOR THOSE. AB TWENTY TO TWENTY WOULD EXPAND ON THAT SIGNIFICANT STRIDES MADE BY THE STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS TO PROTECT COLLEGE ATHLETES UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS ONLY. APPLIES TO INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AT FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT RECEIVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN ANNUAL REVENUE. DERIVD FROM MEDIA RIGHTS FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS THIS MEANS ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES AT UCLA YOU UC BERKELEY STANFORD AND U. S. C. ARE PROTECTED UNDER CURRENT LAW. THIS HAS CREATED A TWO TIER SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES. COLLEGE ATHLETES HAVE PROTECTIONS UNDER THE STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS VERSUS COLLEGE ATHLETES TO CONTINUE. TO LEAVE IT ALL IN THE FIELD FOR THEIR SCHOOL WITHOUT A GUARANTEE. THAT THEIR SCHOOL WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THE SAME FOR THEM. CURRENTLY FORTY THREE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WITH COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS IN DIVISION ONE AND TO HAVE THE AUTONOMY. BUT AREN'T REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO PAY FOR AN ATHLETE'S MEDICAL EXPENSES IF THE ATHLETE GETS INJURED ADDITIONALLY COLLEGE ATHLETES WHO GET INJURED DURING PRACTICE OR GAME ARE NOT. DETECTED FROM LOSING THEIR ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY WILL REQUIRE INSTITUTIONS TO PAY THAT DID THAT DEDUCTIBLES FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES WHO SUFFER SPORTS RELATED INJURIES. AND FOR THE COST OF ONGOING MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS AFTER A STUDENT HAS GRADUATED OR LEFT THE UNIVERSITY FURTHER AB. TWENTY TO TWENTY REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE AN EQUIVALENT SCHOLARSHIP. IF THE STUDENTS ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP IS NOT RENEWED DUE. TO AN INJURY WITH AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY WE CAN GIVE COLLEGE ATHLETES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE ABILITY TO SUCCEED BOTH IN THE CLASSROOM AND ON THE FIELD WE OUGHT NOT TURN OUR BACKS ON OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES IN THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY NEED US MOST. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WITH ME HERE TODAY IS REMOTE JEHOVAH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COLLEGE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU AGHA MORNING MY NAME IS REMOTE HUMA A FORMER UCLA FOOTBALL PLAYER. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NTTA THE NATIONAL COLLEGE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION. THEN SHE PAYS AN ADVOCACY GROUP MADE UP OF OVER TWENTY THOUSAND CURRENT AND FORMER COLLEGE ATHLETES FROM COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. THEN HE PAYS THE SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY CLASSES COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES. A RECENT STUDY REVEALED THAT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COLLEGE ATHLETES SUSTAIN A MAJOR COLLEGE SPORTS INJURY. AND FIFTY PERCENT OF COLLEGE ATHLETES WILL SUFFER FROM CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES. THESE ARE THE WHY SOME OF THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. BUT PLAYING SPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES PUT IN PERSON AT SIGNIFICANT RISK. EACH OF THESE INJURIES COMES WITH A CHOICE OF PAYING FOR THE COST FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURES. OR LIVING LIFE WITH A CHRONIC INJURY. IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT RISKS AND COLLEGE SPORTS BECAUSE ATHLETES ARE TOO OFTEN PRESSURE TO PLAY WITH SERIOUS INJURIES. WHICH CAN INCREASE MEDICAL EXPENSES. SPORTS RELATED INJURIES HAVE A DIRECT CAN HAVE A DIRECT NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON A PLAYER'S ABILITY TO GRADUATE. INJURIES REQUIRING A MAJOR SURGERY AS WELL AS CONCUSSIONS CAN DIRECTLY INTERFERE WITH THE PLAYERS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ACADEMICALLY. AND UNDER NCAA RULES COLLEGES CAN REFUSE TO RENEW AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP FOR PERMANENTLY INJURED PLAYER. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT GRADUATION RATE PROBLEM THEIR RANKS AMONG THE WORST IN THE NATION. EIGHTY ONE OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE CALIFORNIA'S COLORS TEAMS ACROSS TWENTY NINE DIVISION ONE A DIVISION TWO COLLEGES. HAVE GRADUATION RATES BELOW SIXTY PERCENT. WITH AN AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT. SOME OF THE COLLEGES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MUCH WOULD COST EXTERNALITIES SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TWO WEEKS FOR DEGREE COMPLETION AND PAY FOR PLAYERS MEDICAL EXPENSES. BUT US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DATA. SHOW STRONG REVENUE AND BOTH DIVISION ONE AND DIVISION TWO. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. DIVISION TO REVENUE AMONG COLLEGES AND CALIFORNIA INCREASE FROM SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. TWO ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS IS A REVENUE INCREASE OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. NOTABLY PARTICIPATION ONLY INCREASED FORTY SIX PERCENT. WHICH SUGGESTS THE DIVISION TO COLLEGES HAVE THE PATH THE MONEY TO GUARANTEE PROTECTIONS FOR THE PLAYERS. HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO. CALIFORNIA'S DIVISION ONE COLLEGES ENJOYED REVENUE INCREASE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DURING THE SAME TIME PER. WHILE PARTICIPATION NUMBERS ACTUALLY DECREASED BY ELEVEN PERCENT. THESE COLLEGES CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE THESE PROTECTIONS. THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO DIRECT SOME OF HIS WHEN FOR REVENUE. THEN TO GRADUATE AND GUARANTEE MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE PLAYERS WHOSE BODIES ARE BROKEN WHILE GENERATING THIS MONEY FOR THE COLLEGES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL. WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. XENON ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FOR GOOD MORNING ERICA ROMERO BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING THE PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. WHERE REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION? FIRST WE ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR XIN ATHLETES AND TAKE THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE ENCOURAGE EVERY MEMBER TO COME VISIT YOUR LOCAL COLLEGE CAMPUS. AND VISIT ACROSS THE DIVISIONS TO SEE HOW WE ARE TREATING OUR STUDENTS AND THE SUPPORT WE PROVIDE FOR THEM. I AM UNFORTUNATELY FIRST I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE BILL MAKES REFERENCE TO THE NC DOUBLE WAY. NOT NUMBER INSTITUTIONS PLAY IN THE NC DOUBLE A. EFFECTS SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS PLAY IN THE M. EIGHT I A. THE SMALLEST OF THEM HAS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE STUDENTS. AND THAT'S TOTAL. BUT IT'S NOT OR SHOOT UP THE POPULATION. AND SO OF THIS BILL ACTUALLY IMPOSES SEEM REQUIREMENTS ON THE ANYWAY SCHOOLS THAN IT DOES ON THE NC DOUBLE EIGHT SCHOOLS. AND SO I. WE TAKE ISSUE WITH IMPOSING THOSE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTENSELY CHOSE TO PLAN A DIFFERENT WHICH. SECONDLY. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS RELATED TO. THE MULTI YEAR SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENT. WHILE DIVISION ONE MAY CHOOSE TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO THIS EXPERIENCE THAT. TWO INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE MEDIA REVENUE. THERE WAS A REFERENCE MADE TO REVENUES GENERATED BY SPORTS. WE ALSO INSTITUTIONS FOR REVENUES AND EXPENSES. IN ONE CASE TICKET SALES WAS TWENTY THOUSAND BUT INSTITUTIONS BENDS OVER TWO MILLION. EVERY OTHER PENDING WHAT'S FUNDRAISE BY THE INSTITUTION. THAT'S WHERE THE REVENUE CAME FROM. ANSWER TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS INCREASES THE COST ON THE INSTITUTION. IT MEANS THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDRAISING HAS TO HAPPEN. FOR. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS HAS TO HELP RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS ESSENTIALLY THAT GENERATE REVENUE IN THE TEND TO BE FOOTBALL. AND MEN'S BASKETBALL. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH THE FUND RAISING FOR STERN ATHLETICS. THIS IMPOSES ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR XIN SO WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. BUT WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS FOR A REASON. IT WERE TO BE REPLACED THERE'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION PARTICULARLY FOR OUR SECTOR. THAT WERE FLUSH WITH CASH IN THAT WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT UNFORTUNATE THAT'S NOT TRUE. CUSTOMER INSTITUTIONS ALREADY HAVE UNMET FINANCIAL AID NEED. AND SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THAT SO THERE THERE'S NOT A MISPERCEPTION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL ABILITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. ANIMAL IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION. FOR THESE REASONS IN THE OTHER CELL AND AN ART LETTER WHERE POST. GOOD MORNING EDGE MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE MINUTES TAKEN OUR ARMED SUGGEST ME NOW SO I DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ADOPTED BY THE. A RETIRED AUTHOR.

DE LAST STRIKER IN THE SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT HAVE ATHLETICS IS CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS. CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS IS OUR NEWEST CAMPUS. AND WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING ATHLETICS AT ONE POINT A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OUT ACTUALLY HIRE THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR READY TO GET GOING WITH THAT PROGRAM. BUT THEY HAD THEY HAD FIRED AT THE CHARACTER BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS. THAT WERE HITTING THE SYSTEM SYSTEM I HAVE A STATE RACES BASICALLY. THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT AUDITOR'S ONE SCHOOLS. IT ALL REDUCE INTO SCHOOLS THERE ARE OPERATING OUR DIVISION TO SCHOOLS ARE OPERATING ON A STRING SHOESTRING BUDGET. FOR EXAMPLE HUMBOLDT STATE CAME VERY VERY CLOSE THEIR DIVISION TO. THEY CAME VERY VERY CLOSE TO CANCELING FOOTBALL LAST YEAR. THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THAT COMMUNITY FOOTBALL IS. NOT REALLY A MONEY MAKER IT'S PART THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TOUCHSTONE FLAT COMMUNITY. THE TRAVEL QUITE A BIT. TO MEET THOSE DAVID CHIU REQUIREMENTS POPULAR NOW THAT THERE FRANKLY. THE ARMED LESS CSU SCHOOLS THAT. HAVE A BALL POINT PEN EXIST NOW CRITIC DESPITE SISTER SCHOOLS AFFABLE. THIS IS GOING TO REALLY REALLY MAKE CAMPUSES MAKE CHOICES ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND THE MONEY THAT IS TO SCHOOL LEVELS. AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE HARD CHOICES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BACK THE REPLACE SCHOLARSHIP IT'S IN CONFLICT WITH OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS GOALS WHICH IS TO GRADUATE STUDENTS A FASTER RATE THAN WE CURRENTLY ARE AT.
