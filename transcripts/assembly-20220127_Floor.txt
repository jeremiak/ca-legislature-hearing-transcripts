WHAT THIS BILL WILL HELP PREVENT FUTURE VICTIMS OF FATAL GUNSHOT WOUNDS IT ALSO AIMS TO AVOID THE EMOTIONAL MENTAL DISTRESS TO THE OFFICER WHO MISTAKENLY FIRED THEIR WEAPON. STUDIES SHOW THAT OFFICERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY SUICIDE. THAN IN THE LINE OF DUTY THE MOST OFFICERS NEVER SEEK MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THIS BILL AS A PROACTIVE MEASURE TO PREVENT FATAL CATASTROPHES BY REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. TO CARRY THEIR TASERS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PRIMARY WEAPON.

THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'M AN AVID A NEWSPAPER READER I READ THE NEWSPAPER AND MEDIA SOURCES EVERY DAY I LAST WEEK I WAS REALLY HORRIFIED TO READ YET ANOTHER STORY. ABOUT A CHILD KILLED BECAUSE SOMEONE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD ANOTHER YOUNGER CHILD IN THIS CASE IT WAS A TODDLER FOUND AN UNSECURED FIREARM IN THE HOUSE. LAYING WITH IT. AND THE RESULT WAS THAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL WAS SHOT TO DEATH TWENTY. FIREARMS BECAME THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN AUTO ACCIDENTS BUT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY NOW SOME OF THESE WERE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THESE WERE INTENTIONAL MURDERS BUT MOST OF THEM. WERE UNINTENTIONAL OR CHILDREN WHO FOUND AN UNSECURED FIREARM IN A PARENT'S HOME. HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT OLDER CHILD WHO KNEW HOW TO HANDLE A GUN RESPONSIBLY WAS SUICIDAL. THESE ARE TRAGEDIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE. IF A PARENT SECURELY LOCKS THEIR GUN AS REQUIRED BY LAW IN CALIFORNIA BE PREVENTED. AB FOUR FIFTY TWO SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT OUR SCHOOLS WHEN THEY DO THEIR NORMAL PARENTAL NOTIFICATION TO PARENTS ABOUT A NUMBER OF ISSUES ALSO NOTIFY PARENTS ABOUT THE LAWS REGARDING SAFE STORAGE OF FIREARMS AND REMIND THEM OF THE REASONS THAT PUTTING A GUN IN A SHOE BOX IN THE TOP OF THE CLOSET OR KEEPING IT IN A DRAWER OR NOT WALKING A GUN CASE. COMPLETELY ON A DOUBLE INTEREST FOR THEM AND THEIR LOVED ONES. IN THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANKS FRIEDMAN IS BACKING HIM YOUR RANGE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR FIFTY TWO AND WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. GLENDALE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. AS THAT A MOM I FOUND OUT. THAT OTHERS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD DID HAVE GUNS THAT WERE NOT SAFELY STORED AND I STARTED ASKING THE QUESTION WHEN MY KIDS ARE GONE. BATES WELL SOMETIMES. WITH A HIGH I'M YOU HAVE GUNS IN YOUR HOME AND IF SO HOW ARE THEY STORED. AND I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT. I CHILDREN SOCIALIZE WITH HAD THE GUNS THAT WERE NOT STORED SAFELY OFTEN WHEN THEY STARTED THE CONVERSATION THE PARENT WOULD REALIZE. MAYBE THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO IT AND THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO GET A GUN LOCK OR A GUN SAFE AND THEN I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE MY CHILD GOING AND PLAYING IN THAT HOME. BUT THE CONVERSATION WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE OPERATED AND THAT IS WHY WHEN IT THANK YOU. M. OUR COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BECAUSE EDUCATION IS SO CRITICAL IT WILL SAVE LIVES IT IS A SIMPLE MEASURE YET IT IS ONE THAT WILL IMPACT MANY FAMILIES AND HOPEFULLY CHANGE.

THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENTS AND GRANT MONEY TO SCHOOLS TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF PLANT BASED VEGETARIAN AND RESTRICTED DIET MEALS AND PLANT BASED MILK OPTIONS. ALSO IT WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON HOW TO SERVE ELIGIBLE YOUNGER SIBLINGS A FEDERALLY REIMBURSABLE MEAL AT A SCHOOL SITE THAT THEIR SIBLING ATTENDS. WE'VE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO EXPAND OUR BILL TO INCLUDE TWO OTHER DIET OPTIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND GRANT MONEY RESTRICTED DIET FOOD OPTION WHICH INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO RELIGIOUS DIETARY RESTRICTIONS ANY VEGETARIAN FOOD OPTION. LAST YEAR WE TOOK THE FIRST STEP TOWARD RESPONDING TO CHILD CHILDHOOD HUNGER BY PASSING THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO DISCUSS HOW WE FEED OUR NON SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND WHAT FOODS WE ARE FEEDING OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS AND BE MINDFUL OF THE MANY DIETARY RESTRICTIONS AND LIFESTYLES THAT EXIST AMONG THEM COUPLE OF YEARS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND THIS BILL CAN DO THAT FOR MANY OF THEM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW TO YOU COLLEAGUES TO THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN EXPANDED FROM SOLELY PLANT BASED FOODS TO INCLUDE DIETARY AND MEAT. I'M SORRY DAIRY AND MEAT. AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL DIETS WHETHER PLANT BASED VEGETARIAN HALAL KOSHER GLUTEN FREE YOU NAME IT. THE BILL PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT OF UP TO TWENTY CENTS FOR EACH PLANT BASED FOOD OPTION. RESTRICTED DIET OPTION AND VEGETARIAN OPTION AND TEN CENTS FOR A PLANT BASED MILK OPTION. LET ME REITERATE THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES MEAT AND DAIRY AS WELL ROVIDES A GRANT OF UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TRAINING RESOURCES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION FOR ADDITIONAL WORK ADDED AND A ONE TIME GRANT OF THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HELP COLLECT NECESSARY DATA. FURTHERMORE IT REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN FEED THE YOUNGER SIBLINGS OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN A FREE BREAKFAST OR MORNING SNACKS. GUARANTEEING THAT THEY ARE FED THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY WE'VE MET WITH OPPOSITION AND I'VE HEARD THEIR CONCERNS WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET THEIR NEEDS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MRS AREA. MS RIVAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY AS A JOIN AUTHOR OF AB FIVE FIFTY EIGHT AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION BY CREATING A UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM THAT WILL PROVIDE TWO FREE MEALS TO EVERY K. TWELVE STUDENT IN THE STATE. AB FIVE FIFTY EIGHT SUPPLEMENTS THIS PROGRAM BY ENSURING THAT SCHOOL MEALS ARE INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE SO THAT NO STUDENT WITH DIETARY RESTRICTIONS WILL GO HUNGRY WHILE LEARNING AT SCHOOL. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH SCORE SILVA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT SCHOOL MEALS AND CHILD NUTRITION ACT. MEMBERS MANY OF US HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION IN PLANT BASED MEALS MANY OF US AREN'T SURE WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE A CHOICE NOT A MANDATE AGAIN THESE ARE GRANT PROGRAMS BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR GROWING LATINO STUDENT POPULATION. IS BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHEN OUR LATINO COMMUNITIES THAT OBESITY AND DIABETES ARE SOME OF THE GROWING HEALTH INDICATORS THAT YOUNG STUDENTS ARE ATTAINING NOW AS EARLY AS IN THEIR TEENS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. PLANT BASED MEALS HAVE SHOWN ONE TO BRING DOWN MANY MANY POOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS AGAIN IT IS NOT A MANDATE IT IS A GRANT PROGRAM THIS WILL COMPLEMENT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE GOING BACK TO GUESS WHAT. COOKING WE KNOW THAT MUCH OF OUR PROCESSED FOOD ARE ALSO CREATING POOR OUTCOMES AND SOME OF US AS OLD AS ME REMEMBER WHEN WE ACTUALLY COOKED IN OUR KITCHENS FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK WHICH COURSE OF MISSED COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LET ME BE CLEAR I FULLY SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOMMODATING STUDENTS NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THE HEALTH RELIGIOUS OR PURPOSES. HOWEVER AFTER CONCERNS. BECAUSE NOTHING THE BILL I'VE READ. MANDATE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BY THE PRODUCTS FROM CALIFORNIA- CALIFORNIA'S A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR AG INDUSTRY I WILL ASK MY DISTRICT. IN A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE PASSED A BILL THAT MANDATED THAT SCHOOLS BY THEIR FRUIT CUPS FROM. CALIFORNIA VENDORS IF THEY'RE BUYING IT FROM FOLKS FROM CHINA FROM OUT OF THE COUNTRY SO. THAT IS THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR JUST TO MAKE SURE IN THE BILL THAT MANDATED BY FROM CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE BIG ISSUES THINK ABOUT PRICES FOOD PRICES- A LOST COVERAGE THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. WE A LOT OF GREAT THEY'RE GOING TO SOUTH AMERICA A LOT OF CITRUS IN CHINA SO WHEN YOU'RE CALIFORNIA FARMER RANCHER. AND YOU'RE COMPETING WITH A GLBAL MARKET IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THE PAST THREE CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S REALLY A BIG ISSUE WITH THAT. AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT HOPEFULLY OFFER CAN ANSWER IT IS CLOSE. BUT IT IT REALLY COMES WITH WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE FOR A FOOD MARKET WHERE FOR INSTANCE- CARMEL BENNETT TRACTOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH THAT CHARGE CAN. USE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. HOW ARE FARMERS FOR TO COMPETE BECAUSE THIS THIS ONE ARE TIED BEHIND THEIR BACKS. CAL DOES. GOOD JOB OUT OF A SLUMP. IT IMPACT THAT WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER TO- A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO ONE OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES HAD A BILL. ON THE DAIRY ISSUE TO BASICALLY DO AWAY WITH CALLAS. WE PASSED A BILL THAT HAS THE LOWEST ANTIBIOTICS DINNERS IN THE COUNTRY THE LOWEST. AND WE'RE ON THE VERGE BEFORE A FEW YEARS BACK THE FORCING OUR DAIRY HERDS. OUT OF CALIFORNIANS BEING BROUGHT IN FROM ELSEWHERE SO YOU KNOW WE LOSE CONTROL OF THAT SO. MY CONCERN IS HOW DO WE DO THAT ONE IN SEVEN KIDS IN CALIFORNIA- FOR FOOD INSECURE. THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW SO IF YOU OFFER CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND I JUST AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT'S A MATTER OF EQUITY AND I SEE A LOT OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE MORE. WELL OFF. TAKING ADVANTAGE THIS PROGRAM EVEN THOSE GRANT FUNDED. THAN OUR SCHOOLS IN THESE MINORITY AREAS SO IF YOU OFFICE. THAT APPRECIATE THAT. MISTER JERRY MAN THAT A IS CLOSE. TO WHEN YOU ORDER. YOUR RIGHT. YES I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FOR THE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF HEALTHY SCHOOL LUNCHES. MY CONCERNS ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE- WE CLEARLY SHARE THE SAME GOALS. FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. OF HAVING CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY. AND SUSTAINABLE MEALS THIS LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. HAVE BEEN CHAMPING A FARM TO SCHOOL CONCEPT THE PRIORITIZE FRESH AND LOCALLY SOURCED FOOD ITEMS. MY CONCERN IS THAT- THIS BILL COULD INCENTIVIZE. OF PLANT BASED FOODS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIGIN OVER LOCALLY SOURCED FOOD SO. I'LL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. WE'VE GOT A- MAZING LOCALLY SOURCE FOODS IN IN IN MANY OF THE EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. AND I WOULD HATE THIS SOMEHOW DISINCENTIVE EYES THAT. WERE IN FAVOR SOMETHING BY COME FROM ANOTHER STATE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD DOCTOR FOR. CORPORATE IS MIKE DOWN MISTER MURATSUCHI ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BUT- AS A PARENT AND AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AUTHOR IS AWARE THAT MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE NO DATA TO SUPPORT IT BUT MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT AS MUCH AS WE TRY TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING. WHEN YOU GO TO THE OUR SCHOOLS AND YOU SEE YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE WASTE BASKETS YOU SEE ALL THE HEALTHY FOOD THAT'S BEING THROWN YOU KNOW THE APPLES IN THE SALADS ARE THROWN AWAY IN THE AND THE AND THE GARBAGE CANS THEY THE PIZZA SENATE ORDERS YOU KNOW IT THE FRUSTRATES ME AS MUCH AS ANYONE BUT- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- TRY TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW OPTIONS ARE TRYING TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING. THAT SO WE TRY TO WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE LANDFILL WITH MORE WASTED FOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI. DR WORK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER UP MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL SEEMS TO GIVE A PREFERENCE TO PLANT BASED MILK SUBSTITUTES OVER MAIL AND AT LEAST FOR MANY YOUNG CHILDREN ARE IT'S REALLY PREFERABLE TO HAVE- JERRY MAIL AS OPPOSED TO PLANT BASED MILK AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT YOUR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR QUIRK MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER RISES JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND- ON A COUPLE OF THE POINTS OR RAISES ALL OF EVERYONE RAISING SOME PRETTY VALID CONCERNS HOWEVER. ON SOME OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE OF THE SOURCING OF FOOD I DON'T BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A REQUIREMENT THE FOOD COMING INTO OUR SCHOOLS OUR SOURCE IN CALIFORNIA IF SOMEONE WANTS TO WRITE A BILL BILL ON THAT IN GENERAL THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN HAVE A MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT I THINK THE SCHOOLS WITH. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD RAISE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING COSTING ON THAT BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY FAIR ARGUMENT OR ER DISCUSSION TO HAVE SEPARATE FROM THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WE DON'T DO IT ANYWAY WE DON'T REQUIRE HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT. FOR OUR FOOD SUPPLY RIGHT NOW COMING INTO OUR SCHOOLS WIDELY WE CREATE THAT REQUIREMENT FOR THIS ONE PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM WITH IT WHICH AGAIN IS NOT A REQUIREMENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN CHOOSE TO OPT IN. SECONDLY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE STARTED A PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO TO HAVE A SALAD BARS WE STARTED OUR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. BUT WE FOUND- NOT ANECDOTALLY BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWED IS THAT THE KIDS ACTUALLY THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY DID GRAVITATE TOWARDS THE SOUTH WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A PARENT LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPTIONS THAT IT ACTUALLY BECOMES A MEANINGFUL OPT FOR THEM BUT THEY DO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DON'T HAVE PIZZA EVERY DAY- BUT WHAT THEY DO WHAT DO YOU DO FIND IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEER PRESSURE INVOLVED THEY SEE OTHER FRIENDS AND FOLKS IN THE SALADS. THEY START DOING IT TOO SO I THINK IT GOES BOTH WAYS IN THAT REGARD OTHERS YOU KNOW IT BUT ALWAYS I THINK THE ISSUE OF WHO WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OF CONCERN INCLUDING OUR SCHOOLS BUT THAT'S ONE THING WE FOUND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE REGARD FOR THE PLANT BASED MILKS IT'S ABOUT CREATING NEW OPTIONS OF RIGHT NOW OF MILK OF DAIRY MILK IS ALREADY PROVIDED SO IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING MORE OPTIONS NOT FORCING ONE TYPE OF NUMBER SAYING HERE'S VARIETY OPTIONS I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. THAT ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT OR ALLERGIC TO DAIRY AND THEN THEY DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE TO HAVE NO. THEIR SCHOOL DAY SO THESE ARE ALL ISSUES AND QUESTION OR OR VALID BUT I THINK THAT THIS PUT PROGRAM BEING IN THE PROGRAM ALLOWS OPERA FOR A TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF FOOD THAT'S COMING IN TO OUR SCHOOLS ALLOW DISTRICTS TO APPLY FR GRANTS TO TRY ONE OF PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP EDUCATE US EVEN MORE AND ADDITIONALLY I ALSO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS ANY OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR US TO INCENTIVIZE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SOURCING FROM LOCAL FARMS WHAT HAVE YOU THAT COULD BE PART OF A DISTRICT GRANT. BUT THEY PUT IS ABLE TO WORK WITH A LOCAL FARMERS AND SO ON SO THE THERE'S NOTHING THAT WAS SET UP TO THAT CAN'T BE EITHER ADDRESS OR WORKED ON GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PROGRAM IN ITSELF ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION REGARDING SCHOOL NUTRITION- I WILL RESPECT THE ANSWER I DON'T THINK YOU. THANK YU MISTER KALRA MISS PARA QUE HAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE THING WHICH IS THAT WE AS A BODY CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT MAKING CALIFORNIA ORE INCLUSIVE. AND EQUITABLE. MY SISTER LIVES IN A STATE THAT HAS- FREE. ACCESS TO FOOD FOR ALL STUDENTS AND I MY NIECES FIRST DAY OF TKC CAME HOME WITH HER LEFTOVER BREAKFAST. WHICH WAS A BACON OMELET. MY SISTER HAS A KOSHER HOUSEHOLD. AND MY NIECE HAD NEVER HAD BACON IN HER LIFE NOR DID HER RELIGION PERMIT HER TO DO SO. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA CHILD IS ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR RELIGION AND HAVE ACCESS TO FOODS IN THEIR SCHOOL. THAT MEETS THOSE NEEDS AND SO WE MUST DO. TAKE ACTIONS LIKE THIS TO EXPAND OUR OPTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERY. KID IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEEDS KOSHER AND HALAL MEALS THEY'RE IMPORTANT PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THEM INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU IS PARA QUE HAVE SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER AND MISS HEARING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TRY TO JOT DOWN THE NOTES AS BEST AS I COULD SO. FIRST OF ALL- TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY SAN JOSE. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND ORINDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF WORDS- AND TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM HAYWARD CLARKSBURG. TORRANCE IN SACRAMENTO. LET LET ME GIVE YOU BRIEF RESPONSES TO EACH OF YOUR CONCERNS. FOLKS ESPECIALLY TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM HAYWARD AND CLARKSBURG THE INCENTIVE IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE. AN OPTION FIRST NOT JUST LEGISLATING AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. YOU DN'T JUST COME DOWN HARD WHAT YOU INSTEAD DO IS INCENTIVIZE THE CERTAIN WAY OF THINKING TO SEE IF IT CATCHES ON OR NOT THAT'S ALL THIS IS. THESE OPTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN TO US. WHEN WE WERE STUDENTS. BUT WE MAY HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF IT AT HOME. AND AS YOU GET OLDER AND YOU REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON IN SOCIETY AND THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE MANY STUDENTS. FROM WHERE YOU LIVE DOWN THE BLOCK FROM WHERE YOU LIVE WHO RELY ON THE DAY OLD HOT DOG THAT'S- YOU KNOW ROLLING SLOWLY OVER AT A LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT V. THOSE CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY HAVE A BETTER OPTION. OF TO THEIR SCHOOLS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER THINGS THERE ARE THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SO IN ORDER. IN ORDER TO. CHANGE THE MINDSET OR AT LEAST ALLOW AN OPTION YOU INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. SO IF WE DON'T EVEN WANNA MOVE THEN WE DON'T EVEN CHANGE THINGS BY INCENTIVIZING THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING DON'T EVEN DARE TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO. BY THE WAY. THE OPPOSITION FOR THIS BILL WAS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL TWO YEARS AGO- UNFORTUNATELY THEY'VE CHOSEN TO. GO BACK TO OPPOSITION AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUALLY WORKING WITH THEM BUT I HAVE NOT YET HEARD EXACTLY THE REASON WHY. THEY WANT TO OPPOSE THIS BILL EXCEPT FOR COMPLETELY TAKING OUT ONE SECTION OF THE BILL. AND TO ME THAT'S THE OPTION PORTION OF THE BILL. SO IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO PROVIDE THESE OPTIONS SECOND OF- TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM TORRANCE WHO TALKED ABOUT- THROWING AWAY MEALS I KNOW I WORRY ABOUT THAT MYSELF QUITE A BIT. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S NOT SEEN AS WELL IN MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FILLED AND ALSO DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE IN LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE IN LOS ANGELES WHERE I WAS MOTIVATED TO DO THIS BILL. THE DEPENDED FOR THIS BILL FORD WAS BECAUSE OF THE ALLEYS BEST PROGRAM. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU FROM LA HAVE VISITED LA'S BEST PROGRAM. YOU'LL SEE THE POOREST OF THE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOLS. STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND LEARN ABOUT NUTRITION LEARN ABOUT COOKING ELEMENTARY KIDS LEARNING ABOUT COOKING AND LEARNING WHAT SPORTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SO THAT THEY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF BECOMING HEALTHIER. THERE ARE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS BUT THEY ALSO NEED THE SUPPORT OF US TO PROVIDE FURTHER INCENTIVES TO THEM AND THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES IT BUILDS IN AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM- SO. I BELIEVE I ALSO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO BYE BYE PLACES BY SPEAKING TO ALL OF THESE THREE POINTS. ALEX DOT THIS BILL HAS A HAS IS JUST PUT PUTTING INTO PLACE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. AND IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS AND APPROACH THINGS WE NEED TO FIRST INCENTIVIZE AN APPROACH AND SEE IF IT WORKS. UP I RESPECTFULLY AND HUMBLY ASK VERY AYE VOTE THANK YOU.
