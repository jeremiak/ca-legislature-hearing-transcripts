CALL OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. WE WILL BEGIN. AS A SUBCOMMITTEE UNTIL WE GET A QUORUM ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAVE BEEN PULLED OFF CALENDAR. ON ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN A. B. TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY SIX COOPER PULLED BY AUTHOR. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT A. B. TWENTY FOURTEEN. E. GARCIA PULL BY AUTHOR. OKAY FOR. WILL BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE WILL HAVE HEARINGS AND MISTER. GRAYSON. THE FIRST ONE HERE SO LET'S BEGIN TWENTY TO FORTY. BUT. ITEM NUMBER TEN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY. RELATING TO TRIAL JURY SELECTION. AB TWENTY TO FORTY WOULD EXEMPT PROBATION PAROLE AND CORRECTION OFFICERS FROM JURY DUTY AND CRIMINAL TRIALS ONLY. DESPITE BEING SWORN PEACE OFFICERS WHO PROVIDE CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES PROBATION PAROLE AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM SERVING ON JURY DUTY THESE OFFICES DUTIES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SUPERVISING OFFENDERS. ON POST RELEASE SUPERVISION MANDATORY SUPERVISION PROBATION PAROLE AND MONITORING ADULTS AND JUVENILES SERVING TIME INSIDE A LOCAL AND STATE DETENTION FACILITY. THE LEAST IS THAT PULLING THESE OFFICERS FROM THEIR ASSIGNMENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCIES ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND ADMINISTER PROGRAMS AND SUPERVISION. BUT THE MOST BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PEACE PEACE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN IN POSITIONS WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL WHERE THEY ARE SERVING JURY DUTY COULD POTENTIALLY BE UNDER THE WATCH JOE OR JURISDICTION IN THE FUTURE. THIS CONFLICT CAN CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK TO THESE PEACE OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES BY REQUIRING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BE SHARED DURING THE COURSE OF THE JURY SELECTION AND OR TRIAL AND FOR THESE REASONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU HAVE TO WITNESS I DO HAVE A WITNESS ALLOWED TO SELF INTRODUCED. TOTAL FIVE MINUTES IN HIGH SPLIT UP. SO FOR MANY SUBS ARE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA UP PLEASE BE A SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. ALT ALTER FOR MY TIME AND TO THE CHIEF WITH US HERE TODAY BUT I DOJUST WANT TO MENTION A FEW THINGS I THINK. OF THE ANALYSIS DOES A GREAT JOB OF TALKING ABOUT ON THE EGGS THE LIST OF. EXIST STEAM EXEMPTIONS FOR PEACE OFFICERS CURRENTLY IN THE LAW AND SPECIFICALLY ON THAT KIND OF PRETRIAL RESPONSIBILITIES THEY PLAY I WOULD NOTE THAT APPROBATION DOES PLAY MANY OF THOSE KIND OF PRETRIAL. TAKE DUTIES IN ADDITION TO POST CONVICTION ON SO PROBATION OF COURSE. IS WRITING PRE SENTENCE REPORTS TO THE COURT THAT TALKS ABOUT SUITABILITY AND ELIGIBILITY. FOR PROBATION I'M WORKING ON TASK FOR BAD TASK FORCES INTERVIEWING WITNESSES I'M DOING MANY OF THE SAME THINGS THAT AGAIN ARE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES ARE DOING WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPTS. AND THEN OF COURSE. YOU KNOW KIND OF POST CONVICTION APPROBATION IS PLAYED A ROLE IN MANY OF THESE CASES WITH THEIR DEPARTMENT SUPERVISING. THESE DEFENDANTS AND SO AS AN ARM OF THE COURTS AND WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATELY THAT. PROBATION ON SHOULD BE IN THE SAME CODE WITH EXEMPTIONS OF EXISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT. I'M ALL THE FOR MY TIME INTRODUCED CHIEF MARK ANAEMIA CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER OF AMADOR COUNTY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND AND. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE THIS MORNING TO TESTIFYING AB TWENTY TO FORTY. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS AN ARM OF THE COURT PROBATION OFFICERS PREPARE REPORTS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BENCH. IT CREATES AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTERESTS FOR EXAMPLE PROBATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING PRESENTS INVESTIGATION REPORTS. TO ASSIST THE COURT IN MAKING SENTENCING DETERMINATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE INVOLVES A. TAKING TALKING TO THE DEFENDANT VICTIM AND OTHER. IMPACTED PARTIES. THE ROLE PUTS OFFICERS IN A POSITION WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL UNDER OUR JURISDICTION IS LIKELY TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION. ARE JURISDICTION FOR SUPERVISION AS WELL WHICH CREATES AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO OUR DEPARTMENTS COMPLETING REPORTS AND AT THE SAME TIME POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE SAT ON THE JURY. AT THIS DOES CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT OUR OFFICERS NOT BE PUT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION AS PART OF THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS. ESPECIALLY GIVEN A ROLE WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SUPERVISING OFFENDERS. I PERSONALLY HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WHERE IN A RARE CASE I WAS ACTUALLY CHOSEN FOR THE JURY POOL AMONG THE FIRST TWELVE RANDOMLY SELECTED TO THE POOL. AT THAT TIME I WAS REQUIRED TO. PROVIDING SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION. ONLY TO THEN BE REMOVED FROM THE JURY ONCE THAT DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND USED ONE OF THEIR CHALLENGES. BUT BY THEN THE AND THE DAMAGE WAS A LITTLE BIT HAD TO IT WAS TOO LATE BECAUSE THE DAMAGE HAD ALREADY OCCURRED. NOT ONLY DID I PUT MYSELF IN FAMILY POTENTIAL DANGER SITUATION BUT HAVING TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO LOST A CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY WORK TIME. THAT I DEDICATE TO MY DEPARTMENT AND MY OFFICERS DEDICATE TO OUR COMMUNITY. AB TWENTY TO FORTY WILL FIX THIS ISSUE AND HELP PROTECT OFFICER SAFETY. REMOVE THE INHERENT FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN OUR ROLE AS WITH THE CORD AND WILL ALSO ASSIST US IN MAXIMIZING THE RESOURCES TO FURTHER IMPROVE CRITICAL. PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBATION OFFICER SUPERVISING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADULT FELONS. AND ROSS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIRTY NINE THOUSAND YOUTH WITHIN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND DETENTION FACILITIES. SO TAKING TIME AWAY FROM OUR CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY NEED IS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. SO I WOULD I REQUEST THAT. YOU SUPPORT AB TWENTY TO FORTY AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MONEY WAS SHOWN MEMBERS COMMITTEE ALBERTO TO RECALL RIPS IN THE STATE COALITION PROVISIONAL RELATIONS IN SUPPORT. CHAIR GREG STUPOR FROM SECONDHAND INFORMATION ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THINKS. LARRY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEXI HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TODAY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS AND THE AUTHOR AND THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING AND ARE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH THEM. AYE ON A NUMBER OF AREAS IMPORTANT TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM VERY CONCERNED WHEN WE START TO DIMINISH THE JURY POOL. RESPECTFUL OF PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE COURTROOM ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO COMES INTO JURY SERVICE IS ABLE TO MEET PRIVATELY WITH THE JUDGE AWAY FROM THE COURTROOM SETTING. TO OFFER THEIR EXCUSE WE ARE CONCERNED EVERY TIME WE REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE JURY POOL IT DIMINISHES OF THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE JURY SYSTEM WHERE THEY ARE ASKED TO REGULARLY SERVE. AND CREATES MORE OF AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THOSE WHO ARE REMAINING AND REALLY JURY SERVICE IS NOT AN INCONVENIENCE IMPEDIMENT TO OUR DAY. THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL PART OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. SHARON RILEY ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ALSO. IN RESPECT FOR OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL. I ECHO THE STATE THE STATEMENTS BY LEXI HOWARD AS FAR AS THE CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW? THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THE JURY POOL. AND THE COUNCIL HAS A LONG STANDING. POLICY OF OPPOSING CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM JURY SERVICE. AND HAS FOUND THAT. STATUTORILY EXEMPTING CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PERSONS REDUCES THE. NUMBER OF AVAILABLE JURIES MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELECT REPRESENTATIVE JURIES AND UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN OF JURY SERVICE. ON OTHERS SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION AND SO WITH THAT THERE'S A CONCERN AT CONTINUING TO. EXPAND. THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONS TO. DO NOT HAVE TO. SERVE ON JURIES. FURTHER REDUCES THAT PULL. AND THERE IS THE CONCERN THAT COURTS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT TRIPLES. ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH. PROSPECTIVE JURORS IN THE COURTHOUSE EACH DAY. TO AVOID HAVING TO DISMISS. LAST A CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR LACK OF JURORS EXCITER HAVE. AND AND IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RAISED. SPECIFICALLY BY THE PUBLIC SAFETY HUMANITY THAT. JUDICIAL COUNCIL ADOPTED CALIFORNIA ROLLS RULE OF COURT RULED TWO POINT ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT WHICH ALLOWS A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION VARIOUS OUR CHIPS EXAMS EXEMPTIONS. BUT THERE'S ONE SPECIFIC TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY. WHICH. PROVIDES A EXEMPTION. WHEN THE SERVICES THEIR SERVICES ARE IMMEDIATE NEEDED FOR OR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND IN CONCLUSION COURTS MUST CONSTANTLY BALANCE THE NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH THE NEED TO RESPECT JURORS TIMES. HOWEVER WHILE JURY SERVICE REQUIRE SACRIFICE ON THE PART OF CITIZENS EXEMPTING CERTAIN CLASSES OF INJURED INDIVIDUALS. BASED ON THE BURN IT MIGHT PUT ON THEM UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE. BURDEN ON THE OTHERS THEM WITHOUT WE RESPECT IT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WELL WHAT. BUT WE. DO HAVE. LET'S. ESTABLISH A CORE. JONES SAWYER HERE. LACKEY. CARILLO. TABLADA. KILEY. QUIRK. SANTIAGO. ONE WAS PRESIDENT AND THE WELCOME. WISH COME WATER DOVE TO TO THE COMMITTEE. AND ALSO WELCOME MISTER. QUIRK WHO CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW. WHAT WILL FIGURE IT OUT? I THINK. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND. YEAH THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED TWO THINGS THAT. THAT IN IN THE INSTANCE OF OF THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE YOU SAID BUT THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE DAMAGE WAS DONE SO I WOULD JUST SORT OF WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT BECAUSE. NO I THINK MANY OF US MAY HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE. SERVE ARM M. ON A JURY. AND. WE ALL ARE TREATED THE SAME WAY. WITH RESPECT TO YOU KNOW BEING CALLED TO SERVE IN HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND. SO JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER IT TO BE DAMAGING. ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT SHARING. PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO. PARTICIPATE IN A PROCESS WITH YOUR FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. A PARTICULAR PERSON. OR TO REVIEW AN INSTANCE OR AN INCIDENT ALARM. WITH FRESH EYES OR A DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSPECTIVE. WELL WHEN IT WHEN I'M DONE MADE THAT STATEMENT THAT THE IDEA IS THAT. BEING THERE WITH THAT A DEFENDANT THAT I'M POTENTIALLY GOING THERE. HAVE TO SUPERVISE WILL BE UNDER MY JURISDICTION I'VE PROVIDED INFORMATION PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT I'M NORMALLY AN ENORMOUS NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PROVIDE. AND THE US I LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THAT I ACTUALLY NAM HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SO AND THE POTENTIAL IS THERE FOR MY FAMILY AND IN MY. CHILDREN TO BE AT AT ELEVATED RISK OF AS OPPOSED TO I'M SOMEONE THAT WASN'T CHARGED WITH A PUBLIC SAFETY POSITION AND SUPERVISING. A SAID OFFENDER. INADEQUATE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE CLOSENESS TO GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF FORT THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PRESENT THIS BILL. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT CONVENIENCE OR EVEN AN ISSUE OF HARDSHIP. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND THAT IS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS PROBATION OFFICERS. AND IT IS TRUE THAT. THAT. POLICE OFFICERS DO HAVE EXEMPTION AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARE SUPERVISOR SUPERVISING. THOSE THAT ARE RELEASED AFTER. INCARCERATION TO ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE. EXEMPTION AS WELL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES THAT MEANS NOT TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER PERSONAL INFORMATION. THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER AS WELL SO THIS IS ABOUT A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE IN KEEPING. OUR PEACE OFFICER SAFE AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU CHAIRS RECOMMEND AYE VOTE. NOW KIM HIM I RESPECTFULLY. IS THERE A MOTION. THERE'S A. BILLS OUT FOR LACK OF HELD A COMMITTEE FOR LACK OF A SECOND. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU BUT YOU. IT IS REVEALED HERE I DON'T TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE. S. ITEMS EIGHT AND TWENTY FOUR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR I AM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER AND I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT ONE OF OUR CAUCUS PARROTBILLS AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ONTINGENT UPON FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET TOWARD FUNDS UP TO ELEVEN DE A OFFICES THAT EMPLOY. VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROGRAMS FOR THE PROSECUTION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CRIMES. VERTICAL. TEAMS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNITS INVOLVED ONE OR MORE STAFF ATTORNEYS WHO HANDLE A SPECIFIC TYPE OF CASE FROM ARRAIGNMENT TO CONVINCE CONVICTIONS. RATHER THAN DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS HANDLING GIVE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE PROSECUTION. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN AWARD. OF GRANT FUNDS UNDER THIS BILL A PROSECUTING OFFICE MUST HAVE SPECIFIC STAFFING DEDICATED FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROVIDE ANNUAL DATA ON THE NUMBER OF CASES FILED BY THE COUNTY. AND THEIR OUTCOMES AND HAVE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ADVOCACY AGENCY THAT PROVIDES COUNSELING. AND OR SERVICE TO VICTIMS AS WE ALL KNOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN. TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND VICTIMS A ARE BEING TRAFFICKED INTO THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY. BETWEEN TWENTY TEN TWENTY TWELVE CALIFORNIA'S NINE REGIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE IDENTIFY AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN VICTIMS. IN NATION INITIATED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO INVESTIGATIONS ARRESTED SEVENTEEN HUNDRED NINETY EVEN THE VIGILS AND PROVIDED CRITICAL TRAINING TO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LAW ENFORCEMENT. PERSONNEL PROSECUTORS VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT MORE SUCCESSFUL ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. WILL SERVE AS A DETERRENT AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING OCCURRING IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU AYE AND WITH ME IS ASSEMBLY WOMAN. CAPTAIN BAKER. LAKE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON I THINK ARE GOOD COLLEAGUE OF MISS RUBIO FURTHER A CO AUTHORING LESS LEGISLATION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE UNITED STATES. AND IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN IN FARAWAY LANDS OR FAR AWAY PLACES AND OR TO PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT. COUNTRIES NOT UNITED STATES SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE DOMESTIC. AMERICAN RESIDENTS AND. I THINK CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO THE FBI HAS THREE OF THE FBI'S TOP TEN HOT SPOTS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VERTICAL PROSECUTION HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BY FULLY PROCESS BY FULLY PROSECUTING THE CASES OF THE TRAFFICKERS. AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS GET BETTER AT THE CASES THEY'RE VERY VERY COMPLEX CASES TYPICALLY BECAUSE THE WITNESSES BEEN. DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE. SIMILAR PROFILES TO THOSE WHO'VE BEEN. SUFFERING FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE WITH RESPECT TO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROSECUTION AND THIS ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET BETTER AT THE CASES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S A VICTIM CENTERED APPROACH TO PROSECUTING THE CASES. A VICTIM DOESN'T HAVE TO MEET A NEW PROSECUTOR AT EACH STAGE OF THE PROCESS BUT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY BLESS YOU. TO MAKE SURE. TO DEVELOP A REPORT WITH THE PROSECUTOR AND REALLY HAVE THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR. JUSTICE TO BE SERVED AND THIS IS FOUND TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I THINK ALL OF US VOTED FOR A RESOLUTION EARLIER THIS YEAR INCREASING AWARENESS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CALLING ON OUR STATE TO DO MORE TO FIGHT IT THIS IS ONE OF THE CONCRETE TOOLS FOR DOING THAT. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I WITH US TODAY WE HAVE JOHN HOFFMAN FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION AND KATIE DE FERRARI WITH THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AS WELL. I SEE ONE. BUT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SHAWN HOP IN WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID. VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNITS WITH THE SAME PROSECUTORS HANDLING THAT CASE FROM THE PRELIMINARY HEARING THROUGH THE TRIAL A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY. IN THE CASES OF VERY YOUNG VICTIMS WERE TALKING ABOUT. SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH VERY VULNERABLE VICTIMS SO. CREAM STRUCTURE WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST BETWEEN THE PROSECUTOR IN THE VICTIM HAS PRUNING A VERY EFFECTIVE METHOD OF PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IN THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT THIS WAY. I IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY ONE OF THE. NATIONAL EXPERTS ON ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. LEYVA RESEARCH INSTITUTE THAT'S LOOKED AT THE TRAUMA SUFFERED BY VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN. ONE OF THE COMMONALITIES THAT THEY FOUND IN TALKING TO OVER A HUNDRED SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO'VE BEEN SEX TRAFFICKED IS THEY HAVE MANY LAYERS OF TRAUMA SO STARTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD HEADING HOME LIFE THAT WAS NOT SAFE. IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE ON AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE SURVIVORS OF SPOKEN AT LENGTH ABOUT THE LACK OF STABILITY OR CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES MOVING FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME HAVING SOCIAL WORKER. AND THEN BEING REPLACED WITH ANOTHER SOCIAL WORKER THAT SORT OF CONSTANT CHANGE BREEDS CHAOS AND VULNERABILITY THAT IS PREYED UPON BY TRAFFICKERS SO. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DA IN HAVING PROSECUTOR ALMOST SIX HUNDRED HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IN THAT OFFICE. IS THAT A VERTICAL PROSECUTION MODEL ISN'T JUST HELPFUL IN TERMS OF BRINGING THE PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE BUT IN BEGINNING TO REPAIR THAT VICTIM AND BRING SOME STABILITY TO THEIR LIVES. WHICH LAST LONG BEYOND THE OUTCOME OF TRIAL AND SO. I'D ALSO POINT OUT AS THEY SAID HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS NOT A PROBLEM JUST IN THE URBAN AREAS OF OUR STATE. BUT IN IN RURAL COUNTIES IN IN COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO EMPLOY A VERTICAL PROSECUTION MODEL SO THAT'S WHY AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO. ALLOW OTHER COUNTIES THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT IN THAT METHOD OF OF PROSECUTION SO WE ASK YOUR AYE BUT. THANK YOU. MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KATE DE FERRARI FROM THEIR CONTRA COSTA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I'VE BEEN A. PROSECUTOR THERE FOR TWELVE YEARS I SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNIT MY HUSBAND'S ALSO PROSECUTOR AND OUR HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROSECUTOR. I CAN TELL YOU. YOU'VE HEARD THE SAYING THAT. THE MEASURE OF OUR SOCIETY IS HOW WE TREAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THAT COME THROUGH OUR OFFICE. THERE ARE VULNERABLE THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST BROKEN PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. AND. VERTICAL PROSECUTION ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THAT CONSISTENCY TO HAVE THAT PROSECUTOR THAT. IF THEY'VE COME FORWARD FINALLY IN THERE FOR AND THEY'RE COOPERATING TO WITHOUT VERTICAL PROSECUTION THAT FILE IS GOING TO BE PLACED ON A SHELF SOMEWHERE AND IF THAT VICTIM BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WELL LET'S SEE WHERE IS THIS CASE WHAT STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS IS THERE. WHAT PROSECUTOR CAN HANDLE THIS PHONE CALL AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT'S JUST SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE AND IT? IT HINDERS A OF SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION AND IT'S NOT FOCUSING ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON WHICH IS THE VICTIM. SO THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT'S. IT'S IN SOME WAYS IT'S UPSETTING THAT WE WOULD EVEN NEED A BILL LIKE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY WAY TO HANDLE THESE CASES. AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR COMMUNITIES IT IS IT IS IN. ITS IN YOUR YOUR HOTELS IT'S IN YOUR MASSAGE PARLORS IT'S IN YOUR NAIL SALONS IT'S IN YOUR EARS ON YOUR STREET. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING. WHO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IS SUPPOSING THIS BILL UNLESS IT'S ALSO AMENDED? TO PROVIDE FOR. AT PUBLIC DEFENDERS AS THE PROPONENTS OF SAID THESE CASES ARE VERY COMPLICATED FOR DEFENDANTS ON. THE US SENATE SO SCAN OF SOMETIMES BEANS LIFE IN PRISON. AND WE NEED RESOURCES. THE DISPARATE A TREATMENT A PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES ALREADY EXIST. US STATEWIDE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES ARE FUNDED AYE THE HIGHER LEVEL WITH BOTH OF COUNTY FUNDS AND WAS STATE GRANTS. COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED. OUR CRIMINAL DEFENSE TO INDIGENTS WHEN MORE MORE FUNDS GO TO THE PROSECUTION. NATIONWIDE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY TWO PERCENT A FELONY DEFENDANTS ARE IN LARGE STATE COURTS ARE REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC DEFENDER SETS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FIGURES. AND URBAN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA LIKE ALAMEDA THE PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER. ON IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PROPONENT WAS TALKING ABOUT ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ON PROGRAM THERE WILL IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND TWENTY SEVEN. TEAM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS. AND A BUDGET OF ALMOST SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. ON THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAD A OF ON ALMOST A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS. ALMOST ON HALF OF WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD. AND THE PAD A BUDGET OF ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THOSE ARE NUMBERS ALAMEDA COUNTY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IS A RELATIVELY WELL FUNDED COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE STATE. AND. SOME COUNTIES IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING AND FRESNO COUNTY FOR INSTANCE PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAVE CASELOADS BETTER FOUR TIMES. RECOMMENDED ON A MAXIMUM OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES. THIS ON EQUAL FUNDING A ROADS CONFIDENCE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT MAKES. ON. AB DIVIDES CALIFORNIANS AND IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THEM. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU TO AMEND THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING FOR PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES. IN COUNTIES WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES GET GRANTS TO PROSECUTE. HUMAN TRAFFICKING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS THE SUPPORT. THAT I MISSED IF I DIDN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH. MONEY VALENTINE FROM CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK. YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

THE TRIAL OF THESE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR LIVES AND RETURN THE BETRAYAL OF TRUST AS DEFTLY ONE OF THE OUTCOMES. THAT THESE VICTIMS WILL DEVELOP. AND SO. I THINK WE'LL GET THIS REMEDY HELPS FOSTER TRUST. AND BRING TRUE TO OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. BECAUSE. THEY DESERVE THAT WE ALL DESERVE THAT AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A VERY UNUSUAL SET OF. DRAMATIC CIRCUMSTANCES SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. TO OUR OF VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEE ANOTHER FOR THE QUESTION TO MAKE LOVE I JUST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. WE NEED A MOTION FIRST. I'M WAITING ON A MOTION. WE WILL. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. A.

QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THE BILL PASSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND SECOND ITEM THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS I'D TODAY I'D LIKE TO. PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE A BILL TO ENHANCE. PUBLIC SAFETY BY KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE ALREADY PAID PROHIBITED FROM HAVING THEM. IN LIGHT OF THE MOST RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT HAS FOCUSED ON GUN LAWS AND THEIR IMPACT ON SOCIETY. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE ALIGNS WITH FEDERAL LAW BY IMPOSING A LIFETIME BAN ON THE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENSE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE INSTANCES WHERE CALIFORNIA'S GUN LAWS IS MORE LENIENT THAN FEDERAL LAW. MEMBERS WE ARE NOT CREATING A NEW CLASS OF PROHIBITIVE PERSONS NOT OWNING A FIREARM BUT MERELY HELPING. KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY PER HEAD OF PROHIBITED FROM HAVING THEM. CURRENT STATE LAW IS AN ADEQUATE TO FULLY PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO THE LA DA'S OFFICE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE FELONY FIREARMS LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. EIGHTY FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE FELONY FIREARM CASES THAT THE FAMILY VIOLENCE DIVISION FILED THE DEFENDANT HAD A PRIOR MISDEMEANOR DV CONVICTION. ABUSED WOMEN ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED IF THEIR ABUSER OWNS A FIREARM AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULTS INVOLVING A GUN ARE TWELVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO END IN DEATH. THEN ASSAULTS WITH OTHER WEAPONS OR PHYSICAL HARM. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHRONICALLY UNDER REPORTED. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL PHYSICAL ASSAULTS PERPETRATED AGAINST FEMALES BY THEIR PARTNERS ARE REPORTED TO THE POLICE. ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REPORTED. LET ALONE ARRESTED PROSECUTIONS PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED. THIS MEANS THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT GO UNREPORTED. THERE IS A VERY REAL CONNECTION BETWEEN PAST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A PROPENSITY TO FUTURE VOTE VIOLENCE INCLUDING MASS SHOOTINGS. TRAGICALLY CHILDREN ARE THE MOST COMMON VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC MASS SHOOT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MASS SHOOTINGS. WHILE WE THERE ARE NO GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ON HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE KILLED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS. THE HOBBIT THE HUFFINGTON POST FOUND THAT CHILDREN UNDER SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD MADE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF VICTIMS IN ITS STUDY. AND WHILE WE SIT HERE AND DISCUSS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES NEARLY THREE U. S. WOMEN EVERY DAY ARE KILLED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER AND NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE ABOUT THE VIOLENCE CRIMES GO UNREPORTED. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS SAYS THAT AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND INSTANCES OF NONFATAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WERE REPORTED TO POLICE. ANNUALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE AND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND INSTANCES WENT UNREPORTED. FOR THE MEMBERS. WHO FOR THE MEMBERS WHO QUESTION WHY SINGLE OUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WELL? I HOPE I WAS ABLE TO SHED LIGHT ON NOT ONLY THE DATA MOST IMPORTANT HE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST OR AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE IN BY INVOLVING A FIREARM. HERE WITH ME UP. I'M REYES AS KRYSTEN EXEC WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE JOHN MYERS FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY AND LOCAL LAW PROFESSOR. I I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KRISTEN NAMES THAT COME WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO HIGHLIGHTED THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FIREARMS IS A DEADLY. IT IS WHY CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN SO MANY STOPS AND WHY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE'S BEEN A LIFETIME BAN ON MISDEMEANOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS FROM POSSESSING OR OWNING A FIREARM. BY TAKING THE STEPS TODAY CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO BRING ITS PROHIBITION I'M MORE CLOSELY IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL LIFETIME BAN. AND HELP MAKE SURE THAT HERE AT HOME IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LEVEL PROSECUTORS IN CALIFORNIA COURTS ARE ABLE TO. ADDRESS OF THOSE WHO MAY HOW. MAY CHOOSE TO TRY TO OWN OR POSSESS A FIREARM TEN YEARS ELEVEN YEARS TWELVE YEARS PAST AND THEIR INITIAL MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTION. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE UP AND ONLY EXISTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IS ONLY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS THAT CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOVING THOSE FORWARD. WE KNOW FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE OFTEN. FOCUS ON OTHER PRIORITY IS UNLIMITED AND THEIR RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEY ALSO. WE APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN BRING THIS FORWARD AND CONTINUING TO LIFT UP THIS THAT DEADLY AND OUR SECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EMPIRE ARMS RESPIRABLE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME'S JOHN MYERS I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I'LL JUST VERY BRIEFLY I'M. JUST ADD THESE IDEAS YOU WHY A LIFETIME BAN FOR. MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A LIFETIME BAN FOR MISDEMEANORS OF VIOLENT CRIMES THAT ARE NOT. VIOLENCE I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS SIMPLY THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS DIFFERENT. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT THAN OTHER. VIOLENT CRIMES AND THE REASON IS YOU JUST CAN'T GET RID OF THE GUY. I SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME IN FAMILY COURT REPRESENTING CHILDREN IN HIGH CONFLICT CUSTODY CASES AND REPRESENTING WOMEN IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES IN YOLO COUNTY. THE PROBLEM WITH FAMILY LAW AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUE. EVEN IF YOU'RE NO LONGER MARRIED HER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP SO THE NEED FOR PROTECTION GOING FORWARD UNLIKE THEIR YOU KNOW THE ASSAULT AND BATTERY ON THE STREET. IT'S DIFFERENT. THE RELATIONSHIP IS STILL THERE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE OVER THAT'S WHY A BAND FOR A LIFETIME IS ESSENTIAL IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MISTY. A AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN. VIOLENCE WE ARE IN SUPPORT I'M THE THIRD PERSON SHALL BE VERY BRIEF IN GENERAL UP WE WOULD LIKE CALIFORNIA. LAW AND PROHIBITIONS TO MATCH FEDERAL LAW IN THE RARE TIMES THAT FEDERAL LAWS STRONGER AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. THAT WAY WE CAN DO THE ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA IMPISH PARTICULARLY IN THIS HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED YET WITH OUR ARE PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM SO THAT SOMEONE WHO HAD A. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROHIBITION IN AND UP THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION IS IN APPS A WEEK COULD ACTUALLY BE THE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO DISARM THE PERSON. TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT. YES ANY OTHER. YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPORT JULIE BORN HAFTAR REPRESENT WE'VE SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S PRIMARY PROVIDER OF SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. KIND OF VALENTINE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THINKING. MICHELLE DUDLEY CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS OF SOLANO COUNTY IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND ME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MORNING AND POLITICAL WITH A CELLULAR CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION A. B. I THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE. THAT WE DO NOT OPPOSE GUN CONTROL MEASURES THAT PROTECT PUBLIC WELFARE AND ARE NON DISCRIMINATORY AND FAIR. UNFORTUNATELY A. B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINE DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH A MISDEMEANOR RIGHT AND WITH A MISDEMEANOR ON THEIR RECORD BY ENACTING A LIFETIME BAN ON ANYONE WITH A MISDEMEANOR. RELATING TO. TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED THE MATTER WHAT THEIR REHABILITATION HAS BEEN LIKE. THIS PERPETUATES THE HARMFUL AND UNFOUNDED STEREOTYPE THAT SOMEONE WITH A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IS FOREVER DANGEROUS IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AGAIN REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN A POLICE OFFICER HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEY CAN PETITION TO GET THEIR GUNS BACK IMMEDIATELY. AND SO UNDER THIS BILL WHICH DOES NOT CHANGE THAT UNDER THIS BILL AND A POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULD PETITION TO GET THEIR GONE BACK THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WAIT TEN YEARS. BUT A CIVILIAN WOULD HAVE A LIFETIME BAN AND THE SPAN IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES ON IF A PERSON WHO HAS EVER HAD A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. FOR THESE CRIMES AND COMES INTO THE POSSESSION OF A GUN THEY CAN BE ARRESTED PROSECUTED INCARCERATED FOR A FELONY. AND THIS WILL CERTAINLY HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE HARMON ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY A FOURTH OF THE FELONY ARRESTS OR ARREST FOR FELONY. A GUN OFFENSES WERE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK AND NEARLY HALF WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE LATINO AND THESE POPULATIONS MAKE UP SIX AND A HALF PERCENT AND THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA RESPECTIVELY. AND SO. WE AGREE THAT WE NEED GUN CONTROL THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS WOULD WOULD DO THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT TEN YEARS ATTEND YOUR BAND IS NOT SUFFICIENT. I'VE THIS BILL STIGMATIZES AND DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVER HAD A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION FOR ONE OF THESE OFFENSES. ON AND WILL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND I WILL NOTE THAT I I'M RECOGNIZED THE. OF THE DATA PRESENTED THAT OF THE. LOW RATES OF REPORTING HAVE OF ABUSE AND VIOLENCE AND. I AGREE WITH THAT I AGREE THAT THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT. ARMED AND INSTEAD IT IT WOULD JUST HAVE THIS DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ORDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE MOST COMMON LAGER DOVE. THANK YOU SO I AM. I HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW THIS IS A INCREDIBLY. PERSONAL BELL AND. AS A SURVIVOR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS AS IT RELATES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I WAS WONDERING IF SOMEONE COULD. HELP DEFINE FOR ME WHAT POSSESSION MEANS. FOR THIS BILL. THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POSITION IT'S ABOUT. OF DYING BEING ABLE TO BUY A GUN. RIGHT. NOUN IT'S A LIFETIME BAN ON OWNING A GUN IS. NOT POSSESSING A GUN IT'S OWNING A GUN. WELL IN MY STATE. IT'S NOT. NO IF SOMEONE. IS IN POSSESSION OF A GUN FORTY YEARS AFTER MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS ONE OF THESE OFFENSES THEY AN. BE PROSECUTED FOR A FELONY. POSSESSION WERE PROBABLY MEAN KNOWING POSSESSION NON. AND IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW. IF SOMEBODY SNEAKS INTO YOUR OFFICE AND SLIPS A HAND GUN IN YOUR BAG YOU'RE NOT IN POSSESSION OF IT CSUS. WHO DO NOT STANDARD CRIMINAL LAW BUT YOU BUT IF YOU'RE KNOWING POSSESSION THEN YOU'RE IN POSSESSION BUT IF I'M? WITH SOMEONE IN A CAR. AND THE GUN IS IN THE CAR. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S IN THE CAR BUT IF WE GET STOPPED BECAUSE I'M BLACK BECAUSE THE TAIL LIGHT IS OUT BECAUSE. I AM BLACK AND SOMEONE STARTS LOOKING IN THE CAR AND THEY FIND IT. THE D. A.. MAY MORE LIKELY THAN NOT ONE TO INTIMATE THAT I KNOW. THAT THE GUN IS IN THE CAR. BECAUSE. I AM BLACK. BECAUSE PROBABLE CAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY WANT TO. WELL I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY ANALYTIC CASTING ASPERSIONS BUT YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THE QUESTIONING HOW ARE WE DEFINING POSSESSION BECAUSE IT CAN MEAN I OWN IT. IT CAN MEAN I. KNOW WHERE IT IS BUT IT CAN ALSO MEAN I JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME AND THERE'S A GUN NEAR ME. AND THEN. ALL SORTS OF THINGS BEGIN TO COME TOGETHER SO IS THERE ANY SORT OF SPECIFIC. DEFINITION OR. DEFINED SCOPE OF WHAT POSSESSION MEANS FOR THIS BILL. WELL I THINK YOU. I MEAN IT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. YOU'RE RIGHT DEMOCRATS WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO FOR A POSSESSION OFA FIREARM BY A CONVICTED FELON AND SO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND JUDGES ULTIMATELY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF CARS AND SO FORTH ALL THE TIME I CONFESS I'M NOT. UP TO SNUFF ON THE ON THE CASE LAW AT THAT IMMEDIATELY GENERALLY UNDER SUBSTANTIVE LAW TO BE IN POSSESSION OF DRUGS ARE IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE POSSESSION OF IT HAS TO BE KNOWING POSSESSION SO. THE ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED IS IS IS THE REAL SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE. THERE'S UNDOUBTEDLY HAS A GREAT DEAL ESTABLISHED LAW ON IT SINCE WE HAVE SO MANY PROSECUTIONS FOR FELON IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM BY A FELON. AND WE FREQUENTLY FIND GUNS AND CARS I'M SURE IT'S BEEN LITIGATED BEFORE I WISH I HAD A MORE DEFINITIVE ANSWER FOR YOU. YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT THAT. SCENARIO IS NOT AN UNUSUAL ONE AND AS ONE THAT THAT COMES UP. OFTEN IN PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED FOR UPS. FELON IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM FOR A GUN IN THE TRUNK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISCREANT. THANK YOU UP FIRST AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO. THIS COMMITTEE AND KNOW THAT SHARING REAL LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT HAVE. DRAMATIC IMPACT IS NOT. AND TO ALL THE THE TESTIMONY THAT CAME INTO DAY THAT AGREES WITH YOUR BILL I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO EMPOWER THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS CALIFORNIA LYING TO FEDERAL STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HERE IS A POLICY COMMITTEE. THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS WHERE THE FEDERAL LAW IS. AND ALIGNING. POLICY IN THAT MATTER SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU BY MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU IT IS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS MY I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY MY SISTERS OF THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HER ABUSERS DOUBLE HARASSING HER. AND. NOT DIRECTLY BECAUSE HE'S UNDER A RESTRAINING ORDER BUT I'M SURE AS SOON AS A RESTRAINING ORDER IS LIFTED THEY'LL BE SOME ATTEMPTS TO TO HARM HER. AND SO FOR ME IT IS PERSONAL AND I AM DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS BECAUSE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS GOES UNREPORTED MY SISTER WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SPEAK AND EVEN BECAUSE SHE SPOKE SHE STILL BEING HARASSED AND I. YOU KNOW WE CAN SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE RIGHTS. OF OF THE ABUSERS ALL ALL WE WANT WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS FOR THE VICTIMS AND THE DANGER STATISTICALLY EIGHTY FOUR. LA COUNTY EIGHTY FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT ARE THE VIOLENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ARE CAUSED BY FIREARMS HAD PRIOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A MISDEMEANORS I AM LOOKING OUT FOR THE VICTIMS AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT HOWL. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THOSE STUDENT THAT SPOKE OUT OF THE AND. AGAINST. OWNING GUNS BUT IN THIS CASE WERE NOT. SUPPORTING THAT. SING CONCEPT ABOUT RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE BUT FOR ME THIS IS PERSONAL AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AGAIN I CAN APPRECIATE THE RIGHTS OF EVERYBODY ELSE BUT WHERE THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS AND I TO ME THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOESN'T SEE COLOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT MC GENDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOESN'T SEE SOCIAL ECONOMIC. CONDITIONS AND. FOR THAT I I. I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS BILL AND I WILL CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REGARDLESS OF. IF I MAY SEEM DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS ARE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ARE. AND AND I DID I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR PASSION ABOUT THIS. AND. AND HOPEFULLY. JUST THIS DISCUSSION HAD NOT DEVOLVE INTO. BEING. PREJUDICE TOWARD DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT. OF THE OPPOSITION. SO. AT SOMEONE. WHO'S BEEN PART OF THE VICTIMIZED VIOLENT WHO GREW UP IN THE BEST BEST A VIOLENT. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME OF SIXTY ONE YEARS OLD. IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER MENTIONED. I'M SIXTY ONE YEARS OLD IT HAPPEN IN MY FAMILY LOW SEVEN. IT WAS BECAUSE ALCOHOL IS. AND UNTIL. THEY GOT TREATMENT. AND UNTIL. MY FATHER AND STEPFATHER. LEARN THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS ROUGH. DO. I HAVE IMAGES IN MY HEAD. THAT'S MY HEAD EVERYDAY. EVERY DAY THAT I CAN'T GET OUT. WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU WHY AM I SO CLOSE TO MY MOTHER. BECAUSE WE WENT TO AT HELD TOGETHER. SO. THIS COMMITTEE. NOT ONLY. WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. VICTIMS. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WINNER SURE THAT THOSE TWO BLACK MEN. MY FATHER AND STEPFATHER. ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST EITHER. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DID CHANGE YOUR LIFE. THEY DID BECOME RESPECTABLE MEMBERS SOCIETY DATE DID GO TO CHURCH EVERY DAY. THEY DID STOP DOING THAT. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS LET'S. MAKE SURE ONE. WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST EITHER ONE. I WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ME AND I'VE SAID THIS A MILLION TIMES FOR ME IT'S ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. AND SO AS I SPOKE TO YOU. IT'S ON THE BOOKS. FEDERAL LAW TAKING CARE OF IT AND SO MIKE MIKE MIKE QUESTION MORE. IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IF THERE'S SOME SOME HOLES IN THE SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE NOT BANNING. PEOPLE. WHO HAVE COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA? ON THAT DAY THAT'S. MY CONCERN TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS IN A WAY THAT. IT'LL BE MOST. EFFECTIVE AND HAVE THE MOST IMPACT SO THAT WE DO MAKE SURE THAT. GUNS DO NOT GET IN THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VIOLENT. PERIOD. I DON'T CARE IF DOMESTIC I'LL GIVE THE HATE CRIME I HAD A BILL. BANNING HATE CRIMES. ON MISDEMEANOR HATE CRIME INDIVIDUALS FROM OWNING GUNS FOR TEN YEARS I WANT TO MAKE A LIFETIME BAN. SO I. I GET IT I'M WITH YOU. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE THAT'LL GET WE IMPLEMENTED. THAT WE JUST DON'T MAKE LOS. I BET ON THE OTHER SIDE ON IMPLEMENTATION WE MAKE LAWS AND THEN IT'S EITHER NEVER REALLY. LET ACTUATED IN A IN A WAY THAT WE FULLY HELPS. OR IT'S DONE INCORRECTLY AND IT CAUSES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHEREWE'RE AT AND AND I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I HADN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME. SO MANY BILLS TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU. AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE IMPLEMENT THIS. WHAT? WHATEVER WAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS FOLLOWS ALONG FEDERAL LAW THAT THERE ARE NO HOLES. IN A CRACK THAT IT DOES. WORK WITH ARE THE SYSTEM TO HALF OF FIREARMS THAT WE DO GO AFTER. AND IF WE HAVE TO RETRIEVE GUNS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS THAT WERE ABLE TO GET THERE. THEY HAVE GUNS OR HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HOW DO WE. GET GUNS OUT A DANGEROUS PEOPLE'S HANDS. AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I'M I'M. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT IF IF WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO THAT. I'M. NOT SURE BEFORE THEY'RE THERE YET AND SO I'M A LAYOFF TODAY HOPEFULLY. WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION BUT. I I FEEL YOUR PASSION. I UNDERSTAND. I'M NOT VOTING BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE. WE ALSO GOT I THINK OF THIS AND THAT AND A SYSTEMATIC LOGICAL WAY. SO THAT WHAT EVER DISK COMMITTEE. PROVES. IT MAKES SENSE AND MOST IMPORTANT WE CAN GET THE JOB DONE SO WE CAN PROTECT. NOT ONLY YOUR FAMILY BUT EVERY FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THAT DOES CERTIFICATE YOU MENTION THAT THEY GO DOWN. OR THEY JUST DON'T STAY THE SAME WE KEEP PILING LAW A COUPLE LAWLER COUPLE LAW COUPLE LAW. AND WE HAVE HIS MOUND. OF PAPERWORK BUT NOTHING GETS DONE. BECAUSE THE IMPLEMENTATION PART. WE FEEL GOOD. THAT WE GET THIS. BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION PART. FALL SHORT. AND THAT'S WHY. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO BRING IT BACK NEXT YEAR BUT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. SO I'M LAYING OFF TODAY. THANK YOU. AB.

I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY A. B. THIRTY SIXTY. FOR. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THE NEED TO BETTER PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE BY FAILING TO REPEATEDLY BREAK OUR GUN LAWS REPEAT OFFENDERS. CURRENTLY A FELON FOUND ILLEGALLY POSSESSING A FIREARM CALIFORNIA TO BE SENTENCED TO SIXTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS THREE YEARS. AND A FELON IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM IS NOT CONSIDERED A PROBABLE OFFENSE WHICH MEANS THAT THE FELLOW WHO'S CONVICTED OF THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. IS NOT GOING TO SEE MORE SEVERE PENALTIES FROM THE JUDGE THE JUDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SEVERE PENALTIES FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS. AND NO JAIL TIME IS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS. IN PRACTICE WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LAW DOES IS SLAP THESE OFFENDERS ON THE REST. AB THIRTY SIXTY FORWARD RAISE THE SENTENCE FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS TO A TERM OF FORCE FIVE OR SIX YEARS IN PRISON AND JAIL. IF THE FELLOW THAT'S BEEN FOUND IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM. AGAIN THIS BILL IS GEARED TOWARDS REPEAT OFFENDERS NOTHING IS CHANGED FOR THOSE WHO FIRST TIME OFFENSE. ARE FOUND TO BE IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM. THE HIGHER TRIAD ONLY KICKS IN IF THE PERSON WANTS. CONVICTED OF VIOLATING THE GUN LAWS DOES IT AGAIN. THIS GIVES THE JUDGES THE DISCRETION THEY NEED NOW. IN ORDER TO SENTENCE APPROPRIATELY THOSE WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR GUN LAWS AND THEY REPEATEDLY OFFEND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND RIGHT NOW MEMBERS IF IF YOU TAKE A MOMENT TO. THINK ABOUT THIS THESE ARE FOLKS WHO SAID I DON'T CARE WHAT OUR LAWS SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY STRICT RIGOROUS GUN LAWS I'VE SUPPORTED ALMOST ALL OF THEM. AND AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY AT THOSE REPEAT OFFENDERS. I'M IS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I'M GRATEFUL FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I THOUGH TODAY. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS KATIE DE FERRARI FROM THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I'VE BEEN ON THE FELONY FILING DESK AT THE PITTSBURGH POLICE DEPARTMENT NOW FOR TWO YEARS I'VE I REVIEW ALL THE FELONY CASES THAT COME OUT OF PITTSBURGH ANTIOCH IN BRENTWOOD. THESE ARE GENERAL FELONIES THESE OF THE ROBBERIES THE SHOOTINGS THE ASSAULTS AND OF COURSE THE POSSESSION OF A FIREARM BY A FELON. IN VIOLATION A TWENTY NINE EIGHT HUNDRED. THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT. GUN VIOLENCE AND THE SENSELESS LOSS OF OF LIVES. AND I THINK. WHAT WE CAN? I MEAN WE WANT TO HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THAT AND. I THINK THIS IS ONE STEP ONE IMPORTANT STEP IS TAKING THE FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. HOW DOES THIS BILL DO IT IT IT? IT ADDRESSES TWO CRITICAL SITUATIONS ONE IS INCREASING THE TRIAD. IF THE DEFENDANT IS GETTING SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR GUN POSSESSION. AND WHEN I SAY POSSESSION I MEAN. CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION AND ACTUAL POSSESSION BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GUN IS PRESENT. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT. WILL MAY BE ALMOST ALL OF US COULD AGREE THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. SHOULDN'T POSSESS FIREARMS. MAYBE I'M. I'M LOW OFF ON THAT BUT I THINK I THINK THAT'S THAT THE VIEW OF MOST CALIFORNIANS. AND IN PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUGHT WITH FIREARMS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HOW DO WE SEND THAT MESSAGE AND AND KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE. ONE WAY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IS GIVING THAT POWER BACK TO THE JUDGES GIVING THE JUDGES THE DISCRETION. TO AND THE LATITUDE TIP APPROPRIATELY SENDS THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS GUN DOES. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T REQUIRING A MANDATORY PRISON SENTENCE. ALTHOUGH I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. BUT I DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW JUDGES HOW THE LATITUDES ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM TO. PROPERLY SENTENCE A DEFENDANT THAT'S THAT'S CAUGHT WITH A FIREARM AND HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. AND THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME PEOPLE ARE GETTING NO JAIL TIME THEY'RE GETTING PROBATION SENTENCES THE ACTUAL PRISON SENTENCES ARE. I WOULD SAY RARE IN IN MY COUNTY. WE HAVE. I I DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH I FOUND THAT A DEFENDANT THAT WAS JUST SENTENCED IN JANUARY HE HAD FIVE PRIOR FELONIES. AND HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A LOADED FIREAM UNDER THE SEAT OF HIS VEHICLE HE HAD A GUN HOLSTER. TAPED HE HAD METHAMPHETAMINE ANNEMASSE PIPE ON HIS PERSON AND A NINE YEAR OLD SON IN THE BACKSEAT. AND FIVE PRIOR FELONIES. AND HE RECEIVED PROBATION AND A SIX MONTH JAIL SENTENCE SO. THAT END OF THE SPECTRUM IS COVERED IT'S COVERED IN MY COUNTY. BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE. YOU NO ANOTHER EXAMPLE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY THAT HAS. A REALLY OLD CONVICTION A FELONY FOR COCAINE POSSESSION. AND THAT PERSON IS CAUGHT WITH A FIREARM IN NAY HAVE NO CRIMINAL RECORD BETWEEN THAT CONVICTION IN THE EIGHTIES OF THE COCAINE POSSESSION AND NOW THEY'RE CAUGHT WITH A FIREARM. MEAN THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO APPROPRIATELY SENTENCED THAT PERSON. BUT NOW AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM HOW ABOUT THE VIOLENT FELONS THAT WAS CONVICTED OF YOU KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR. IS REPEATEDLY CAUGHT WITH A FIREARM AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MOST THAT PERSON CAN GET IS THREE YEARS OF OF STATE PRESENT AND NOT A SERVICE FIFTY PERCENT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AN EIGHTEEN MONTH SENTENCE IS THE MOST THAT THAT PERSON CAN GET. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY ANOTHER WAY THIS BILL DOES IT. TALKING ABOUT MISDEMEANORS PEOPLE THAT MIS USE WEAPONS MISUSE FIREARMS AT THE MISDEMEANOR LEVEL SHOOTING AT AN INHABITED DWELLING. ASSAULT OR BRANDISHING A FIREARM IN THE PRESENCE OF A POLICE OFFICER. THOSE OUR MISDEMEANORS WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO JUST HAVE THE TEN YEAR BAN. SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT ADDITION THAT THIS BILL BRINGS. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. SO PEOPLE. ENCLOSING PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMMITTED FELONIES THEY SHOULDN'T. THAT YOU KNOW THAT IF SHOT IN PEOPLE'S HOMES HAVE BRANDISHED FIREARMS AROUND POLICE SHOULDN'T BE PERMITTED TO EVER HAVE A FIREARM PUBLIC SAFETY DEMANDS THIS SO IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT REDUCING. GUN VIOLENCE. I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THAT THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND I THANK YOU FOR. THIS BILL. CLARK THANK YOU. DON'T ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DETERMINE MEMBERS THANK YOU ROY GRIFFITH CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION STANDING STRONG WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT DA'S OF THE STRAIGHT AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SPORT FAQ. CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN OF THE VELVET CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEAN UNDER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND. MORE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORSO'S ALONE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION SO. THANK YOU. TIM MACMAHON STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BUT ARE GO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. ARM WHERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. FIRST IT'S NOT NEEDED ON THE PROPONENTS I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. AND. THERE IS ALREADY ADEQUATE SENTENCING DISCRETION TO. PUNISH REPEAT OFFENDERS REPEAT OFFENDERS USING THAT DEFENDERS I DON'T WANT TO BE PUNISHED. BUT OF SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT WAY. FIRST UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE. SOMEONE CAN BE PUNISHED WITH THEM ONE YEAR PRIOR FOR EVERY TIME THEY'VE BEEN TO STATE PRISON IF THEY'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH A FELONY. TWO IF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN ARE CHARGED AND CONVICTED WITH A VIOLENT FELONY SUCH AS A ROBBERY. IT IS A STRIKE AND THEY CAN BE THAT THE NEW FELONY THE BASE TERM CAN BE DOUBLED SO. INSTEAD OF SIXTEEN TWO THREE IT COULD BE DOUBLED TO. US SIX YEARS BY THE JUDGE SO GOOD. AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHARGES THE STRIKE THE JUDGE CANNOT. DISMISS THE STRIKE OUT OF HAND WITHOUT THE PROSECUTION'S COOPERATION AND THREE ARM UNDER THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THERE'S TRIGGER LOCK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VIOLENT FELONIES AND THEN ARE. FOUND IN POSSESSION OF GUNS AND THEY CAN BE GIVEN LIFE SENTENCES SO THERE'S ALREADY ADEQUATE DISCRETION ACROSS THE BOARD. ON THIS IS NOT. I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AS AND AS A SOCIETY. IN JUST CONTINUING TO TRY TO LOCK PEOPLE UP TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS ALL WE HAVE BEEN A CREATED IS MASS INCARCERATION. A BOMB PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND WE'VE LEFT OUR COMMUNITIES STARVING FOR RESOURCES FOR EDUCATION FOR HEALTH FOR MEDICAL CARE. SO I WOULD ASK THAT IF YOU TRULY WISH TO. ATTACK THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER. THAT YOU START. WITH NOT PASSING BILLS THAT. PUNISH PEOPLE WITH LONGER SENTENCES THE JUDGES ALREADY HAVE THAT DISCRETION. AND THAT WE TURN TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF OUR PROBLEMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT THE GOOD MORNING TWENTY ONE BACCUS FOR ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS I WILL BE BRIEF. THE. AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR THE DETERRENT TO CRIME IS THE HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF APPREHENSION AND NOT THE FEAR OF A LONGSENTENCE SO LONG SENTENCES ONLY ARE COSTLY. ADDITION TO OUR OVERCROWDED PRISON JAIL SYSTEM WITH VERY LITTLE POSITIVE. GENERALLY NO POSITIVE EFFECT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT DOES WORK IS IS FEAR OF APPREHENSION THE OTHER WORKERS COMMITTEE REINVESTMENT WHICH. OF THE PRIOR WITNESS SPOKE TO. THINGS ARE WORKING CLUED INVESTING IN PRE K. INVESTING IN EDUCATION INVESTING AFTER SCHOOLS INVESTING IN MASS INCARCERATION IS A FAILED POLICY. WILL NOT MAKE IT OUR STREETS SAFER WILL NOT MAKE OUR HOMES SAFER. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT COMMITTEE REINVESTMENT WE STRONGLY OPPOSE INCREASE PENALTIES THAT HAVE NO POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALI ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. KATHY SHARON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU BREAK QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES LIST KILEY. I GOOD MORNING I'D JUST QUICK QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION TO STEP CLARIFIER TESTIMONY SO WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON GUN VIOLENCE. I DON'T THINK YOU BELIEVE THERE BE ZERO IMPACT ON GUN VIOLENCE FROM THE SPELL. EITHER YOU HAVE FOR THE OPPOSITION. WE DO WELL. YOU NEED TO SPEAK INTO THE MIKE I'M GOING TO ANSWER I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE ANY IMPACT BECAUSE AS THE. MISTER BACCHUS SAID ON THOSE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT'S APPREHENSION NOT THE PUNISHMENT THAT IS THE DETERRENCE. AND. GIVING PEOPLE LONGER AND LONGER SENTENCES. IS NOT THE DETERRENT TO GUN VIOLENCE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD UP FOR THREE STRIKES FOR NON VIOLENT NON SERIOUS FELONIES. YES I KNOW I THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME MIXED EVIDENCE AND A LOT OF IT IS DEPEND ON CONTEXT IT'S OF THE DETERRENT EFFECT OF ENHANCED PENALTIES BUT EVEN IF WE. IF YOU OF THERE WERE NO TO TURN AT LEAST THESE PARTICULAR GUN OWNING FELONS ARE WHO ARE INCARCERATED LONGER THERE BE SOME IMPACT ON GUN VIOLENCE FOR THEM NOT BEING. AT OUT THERE TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES RIGHT EVEN IF IT'S A SMALL ONE. THROUGH THE CHAIR. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDIES TO THAT SPEAK TO THAT THAT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT I'D BE HAPPY TO. A REVIEW THEM IF YOU'RE. BROUGH HAS SOME. OKAY. OKAY EYES ZERO YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT HAVING THE AYE FELONS WHO. ARE REPEATEDLY FOUND TO BE POSSESSING GUNS ILLEGALLY INCARCERATED LONGER WOULD NECESSARILY LEAD TO. ANY REDUCTION IN GUN VIOLENCE AND I AND I GUESS I UNDERSTAND SECURITIES EXPERT QUICKNESS ONE OF MY FINANCES. ANY OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YES. I'D HOPE I DON'T SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT COULD YOU ONCE AGAIN SHARE. WITH ME WHAT THE DEFINITION OF POSSESSION IS. FOR THIS BILL AS WELL I THINK YOU MENTIONED BUT IF YOU COULD SHARE TOGETHER. SURE IT ISN'T KNOWING POSSESSION THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING CALLED CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION. BUT BOTH REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIREARMS PRESENTS SO. CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S ON YOUR PERSON BUT ALSO. OF A WEAPON OF A FIREARM IN A VEHICLE. YOU NO I I I HESITATE TO SAY THIS FOR ALL THE. POTENTIAL PEOPLE WITH FELONY CONVICTIONS THAT WATCH THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. BUT. YOU KNOW I REVIEW THOSE CASES ALL THE TIME THAT THE FIREARM THAT'S IN THE CENTER CONSOLE. AND THERE'S FOUR OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE THOSE CASES ARE GETTING FILED THOSE ARE. YOU KNOW UNLESS WE ARE SEEM LIKE A FURTIVE MOVE OF A FURTIVE IT ON TO MY OWN IN YOUR COUNTY OR THEY DON'T GET FILED AT ALL THEY'RE NOT GETTING FILED BY ME. IF I'M GONNA NEED D. N. A. OR FINGERPRINTS ON THAT FIREARM OR I'M GONNA NEED AN OFFICER TO SEE SOME FURTIVE MOVEMENT BY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHERE YOU KNOW. PUTTING THE THE. FIREARM PERHAPS UNDERNEATH THE SEAT BUT SIMPLY A FIREARM WITH FOUR PEOPLE AROUND IT. THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT I'VE I FEEL ETHICALLY THAT I COMPILE. THEN YOU SHOULD BE HOW DID YOU WE NEED YOU IN MY HEART THAT IT DOES. COURT ROOMS. I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH ENFORCEMENT. OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. ARE THERE WAYS TO GUARANTEE CONSISTENCY OF ENFORCEMENT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ACROSS ALL COUNTIES. I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE A MANDATORY SENTENCE IT ON THIS ON THE BOOKS WHICH I THINK. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY FEELS A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH RIGHT NOW IT REALLY THE DISCUSSION BALLS WITH THE JUDGES. YOU KNOW IT. UNLIKE MY MY COLLEAGUE HERE. YOU KNOW JUDGES CAN'T STRIKE STRIKES FROM A COMPLAINER INFORMATION. AS LONG AS IT'S NOT WHAT WE CALL A NICOLE PRIOR THE SIX SIX SEVEN A ONE THAT A JUDGE CANNOT STRIKE. THAT ALL THE OTHER STRIKES GET STRICT AND ALL THE TIME. I SEE IN MY PRACTICE. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE WITH THE ROBBERIES THE ASSAULTS THE SHOOTINGS THAT I'M FILING. I MEAN. I I DON'T KEEP STATISTICS I SHOULD'VE GONE THROUGH MY FILING LOG BEFORE COMING HERE BUT. I WOULD GUESS THAT NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE CASES I'M FILING THEN THE TWENTY NINE EIGHT HUNDRED IT'S LIKE. AN AUTOMATIC CONSIDERATION AND YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE RAP SHEET AND I MAKING SURE IT'S THERE OF COURSE BUT. THE SHOOTINGS THE THE ROBBERIES YOU KNOW CASES THAT ARE ARE HARMING VICTIMS. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ARE NINETY PERCENT OF MY PRACTICE I WOULD SAY ARE OR PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THOSE FIREARMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ON YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S I I APPRECIATE THE TIME I I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE'S A LOT WE CAN BE DOING TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE FOR AND PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITY. OF FOR EVERYONE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PATHWAYS TO CAREERS AND OTHERWISE. BUT I I STRONGLY DISPUTE. STUDIES THAT SAY IF YOU'RE A FELON. AND YOU REPEATEDLY BREAK OUR GUN LAWS. THAT YOU CANNOT BE MADE SAFER BY BEING TAKEN OFF THE STREETS. AWAY FROM THE GUNS. THE REASON WHY APPREHENSION. IS WHAT WORKS IS BECAUSE YOU'RE OFF THE STREETS. YOU'RE NOT USING THE GUNS YOU'RE NOT VICTIMIZING OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO ONLY FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVER. I IT WILL ALWAYS WE SPOKE. EXTENSIVE LOOKS. BUT. WE HAVE. PROMOTION AND A SECOND. THE KILEY SECOND BY MISTER LACKEY. BOB. I KNOW WE SPOKE. ON THIS FOR FOR QUITE SOMETIME. SO. SO MIKE MY CHALLENGES. FOR ME AS CHAIR. WHETHER OR NOT JUDGES. AND SMART DE A. HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS AND HAD ENHANCEMENTS ANYWAY. AND I KNOW THAT FOR ME THAT'S MORE THE ARGUMENT THEN WHAT ARE NOT PUTTING SOMEONE IN. FOR TWO YEARS TO SIX YEARS OR WHATEVER. AND WE CAN DEBATE THAT ALL DAY WE DO ALL THE RESEARCH AND WE WE CAN FIGHT THAT ANOTHER TIME. BUT FOR ME JUST JUST PHYLLIS NOT PHILOSOPHY JUST ME AS. A SOMEONE I WANT TO MAKE SURE. WHAT IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW? THAT WOULD DOING IT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. THAT'S MORE OF A CONCERN I THINK THAT THE JUDGES. HAVE THE DISCRETION AS WAS STATED EARLIER TO TO ADD ENHANCEMENTS DID DO YOU HAVE SOME THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT SADDAM OF. THE ENHANCEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARY WE DID TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER THINGS. BUT THE FORTUNE RAN OUT OF TIME TO TO TO REALLY DEVELOP THAT. SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND A NO VOTE BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ALREADY. HAVE. WHAT WE NEED TO TO TO BE ABLE TO? AT ENHANCEMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IF NOT MAYBE WE WORK TOGETHER TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR. BONTA TO WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL% SYSTEM AND ASK THE JUDGES WHAT DO THEY NEED TO WHAT'S BINDING THEM FROM. FROM FROM BEING ABLE TO KEEP. THESE REPEAT OFFENDERS. PEOPLE WHO MAY WANT TO BE CAREER CRIMINALS THAT MAY NOT WANT TO BE REHABILITATED HOW DO WE KEEP. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GETTING TO HOW DO WE KEEP THEM OFF THE STREETS AND AWAY. FROM. GETTING. POSSESSING GUNS AND THAT'S USUALLY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS MCCONNELL SHOTGUN BLANKET WAY OF DOING IT AND IN THE COURT WITH THE JUDGE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN MAKE THAT DETERMINATION LOT MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WE. CAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH KIND OF AN OVER ARCHING VIEW. SO UNFORTUNATELY CHAIRS RECOMMEND AND NO VOTE.

GOOD MY NAME BECAME A MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WHERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND I'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION TOSS EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION. HAS I THINK ANYONE WOULD ADMIT. MEDICAL INFORMATION TO SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVECALIFORNIA LAW RECOGNIZES THAT WITH THE MIA WHICH IMPOSES. STRICT PRIVACY REGULATIONS ON MEDICAL INFORMATION FEDERAL LAW ASO HAS UNIQUE PRIVACY REGULATIONS FOR MEDICAL INFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS DO NOT COVER CURIOUS OR THE DOJ BECAUSE NEITHER THE DOJ OR CARRIERS ARE COVERED ENTITY MEETING THE DEFINITION. THEREFORE THOSE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THE INFORMATION AND CARES. WHILE SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT CARES JUST CAPTURES PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION AND IS THEREFORE NOT AS SENSITIVE AS MEDICAL INFORMATION. PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION CAN REVEAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS INFORMATION AND CURES ON WHO IS RECEIVING TESTOSTERONE FOR EXAMPLE CAN REVEAL WHO MIGHT BE A TRANSGENDER. MAN UNDERGOING TRANSITION IT ALSO CAN REFER AT CARES INFORMATION CAN ALSO REVEAL IF SOMEONE IS A PERSON LIVING WITH HIV OR AIDS OR WITH CERTAIN MOTHER. MENTAL HEALTH. CONDITIONS THEREFORE IT'S INCREDIBLY PRIVATE SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT A WARRANT. TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE REASON TO NEED THIS INFORMATION. SO WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS THIS BILL AS AMENDED TO INCLUDE A WARRANT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL GOVERNMENT ACTORS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MEGAN ARE TO BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE UNLESS AMENDED WE APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIR HAS BEEN. WILLING TO TALK WITH US ABOUT THIS ITEM AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR. QUITE SOME TIME BUT WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU.

RYAN SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CADMIUM FAMILY PHYSICIANS REGRET REGRETTABLY OPPOSE UNLESS SUBMITTED FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE TABLE LIKE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. GOOD MORNING DANIEL KENDO KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE IS STILL YOU OUTLINED WHERE OPPOSE THE LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCH I JUST WANT TO MAKE A THREE POINTS WHICH IS THAT PICKED A TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED. THAT IT IS LAWFUL TO ACCESS. THE CURES A DATABASE AND THAT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SEARCHES ARE VERY RARE CASE NUMBERS ARE ALWAYS NEEDED AND WARNS ARE REQUIRED FOR SEARCHES OF PATIENTS I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. ON THAT AND WITH RESPECT TO ASK FOR A VOTE. CHEERS RECOMMENDING I AND I THINK IF YOU. NOT THAT DIETING AND I THINK. BOTH OUR MOTION. THOUGH IT. SECOND. AND. I KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OF AIDS. TRANSGENDER AND. DISCUSSION I'M SURE YOU VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT. SO I KNOW YOU WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES NOT BECOME A PROBLEM WITH THE CARE SYSTEM. CHECK IT OUT. ON AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. CHEN SIR I LACKEY LACKEY I CARILLO. CATALOGO DEATH. KILEY. QUIRK. QUIRK NOT VOTING. SANTIAGO. MEASURES ON CALL. THE TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO DATA REPORTING. AND ADDS SCHEDULED FIVE DRUGS TO THE DATABASE WHICH IS OFTENTIMES OF PRESCRIPTION ONLY CARVE SERVICE WHICH CONTAINS CODING. OF THIS IS ALSO ABOUT REQUIRES THAT AND PHARMACISTS HAVE. TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO REPORT. SUBSP DESCRIPTIONS INTO THE DATABASE AWARE AS RIGHT NOW IT DID IS REQUIREMENT OF SEVEN DAYS A SO WE WANT TO JOIN THE TIMELINE IN REAL TIME. TO PREVENT AS MUCH DOCTOR SHOPPING AS POSSIBLE AND ADDITIONALLY HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN VIRGINIA HERALD CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PHARMACY WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THE FOR THE WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY TIMEFRAME FOR REPORTING GET INTO CURES WILL BETTER PHAM ENABLE PRACTITIONERS. AT THE TIME THEY HAVE TO CHECK YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE WRITING A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN OPIATE TO KNOW THE BACKGROUND OF THE PATIENT IN FRONT OF THEM. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT'S IMPORTANT AND AGAIN ALL IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. JEFF. MARY MCKENNA OR CDA ALSO IN SUPPORT FOR THE SIMILAR REASONS AS BOP. AND MAKE AN ORIGAMI HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT AS WE THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR DOCTORS AND WE APPRECIATE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TURNAROUND. A CONFUSING ME OKAY. BERRYHILL OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. HELLO MICHELLE REAVIS CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WELL THE SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION WE WANNA THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR WORKING WITH US. AND WE TRUST THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS OUR HOW MINOR CONCERNS AS THE BILL MOVES POWERED THANK YOU. MAKE YOU. OTHER ANY. WHEN IN OPPOSITION. BECCA KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN AND THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF HAS A MUCH AMENDED POSITION. OPPOSITION IS TO. THE PEACE ADDING SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS HE CARRIES WE DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD I HAD ADDITIONAL PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION TO CARRIERS WITHOUT A WARRANT REQUIREMENT TO PROTECT THAT INFORMATION. HOME I WOULD ADD THAT WHILE ADAM VARIOUS COURTS HAVE RULED ON PIECES OF CARERS AS THE ANALYSIS FOR THESE CARES BELLS ACTUALLY NOTED THE COURTS HAVE PUNTED ON WHETHER SEARCH OF CARRIERS. CONSTITUTES A FOURTH AMENDMENT SEARCH AND SO IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT COURTS COULD RURAL THAT ANY SEARCH OF CARES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD REQUIRE A WARRANT ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE DOJ'S GUIDELINES REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET A WARRANT. WHEN THEY'RE ACCESSING PATIENT INFORMATION THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO GET A WARRANT WHEN ACCESSING PROVIDER INFORMATION WHICH IS A LITTLE CONFUSING SINCE PROVIDER INFORMATION IN ITSELF CONTAINS. PATIENT INFORMATION AND SO IT IS A WAY OF ROUNDS GETTING I'M A WARRANT FOR PATIENTS SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND STILL GETTING PATIENT INFORMATION SO AGAIN FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST THAT. THE BILL BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE A WARRANT REQUIREMENT FOR GOVERNMENT ACTORS BEFORE ADDING ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS TO CARES THINK YOU. THINK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. DANIELLE CAN A KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AS MY COLLEAGUE OUTLINED WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS SEMANTIC THANK YOU THANK YOU. OF ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CLASS YES. YEAH I'D I CLEARLY ADMIRE WHAT TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED YOUR TO THE SECURITY DATABASE AND I AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS. IMPORTANT REMEDY TO THE TABLE BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERN. OVER THE ONE DAY. BECAUSE WE HAVE. MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE'S QUITE A DISTANCE TEST TO BE TRAVELING NOT EVERYBODY HAS. AS EFFICIENT. WITH ELECTRONICS STILL THE PRESCRIPTION PADS ARE STILL. BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ONE DAY AS A VERY VERY VERY FAST TURN AROUND EVEN IF IT WAS. CHANGE OF THREE DAYS IT SEEMS A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE BUT I SEE THAT THE PHYSICIANS ARE OPPOSING. BUT I I JUST HAVE. SOME CONCERNS OVER THE PRAGMATICS OF THIS S. PRESENTATION IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS THAT BEFORE. WE WRAP THIS UP BY DEPRECIATE THAT. HOME CURRENTLY THE THAT TIME PERIOD WITHIN WHICH YOU SUBMIT DATA INTO CARE IS A SEVEN DAYS MANY MANY PHARMACIES ARE THEY DOING IT IN MUCH SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES WELL FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES. FORTY NINE OF US HAVE PD MPS. FORTY FIVE OF THEM ACTUALLY HAVE WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY AS A TIME FRAME EXCEPT FOR ONE STATE THAT HAS ONLINE REAL TIME. ENTRY. AND THAT'S OKLAHOMA. SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME TO TO READ THE PROGRAM UP CHAIRS TO PUT THOSE POSITION AND READY TO MOVE FORWARD TO ACCEPT THE DATA AS IT COMES AND. MANY OF THOSE ENTITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET ARM ALRIGHT ALREADY COMPUTERIZED AND PHARMACIES ARE PERHAPS THE MOST COMPUTERIZED AND HELP TO HAVE ONLINE ADJUDICATION. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY BILL FOR THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES SO WE THINK THAT IF THEY CAN DO ONLINE ADJUDICATION WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO PUT. OPTION DRUG INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM SO THE STATE'S PRESCRIBERS AND DISPENSERS CONCEIVE WHAT IT IS BUT I I BELIEVE THE ASSOCIATION HAS STARTED DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS WITH US SO THAT WE CAN. RESOLVE THIS. THANK YOU AND YOU MAY. INCLUDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT UP THERE AND. I NEED A MOTION. YOU CAN'T. FOR THE SECOND AB SURE.

TO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MAY BEGIN I MAY PROCEED EXCELLENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS WELL JUST IN TIME. HOUSE OF THE LONG PAUSES FOR AYE. BIG MISTER CHAIR I THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING MYSELF TO MY CO AUTHOR BY JOINT AUTHORED A TO PRESENT AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE. THINK ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE THAT IS A SENSE OF UNREST IN COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AMONG THE MANY REASONS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS. SENTIMENT IS THE INCREASINGLY COMMON ACQUISITION OF MILITARY STYLE EQUIPMENT BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. RECOGNIZING THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE THEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CONVENED A FEDERAL INTERAGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT WORKING GROUP. UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER THIRTEEN SAY EIGHT EIGHT AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO BETTER COORDINATE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN FEDERAL COMMITMENT BY STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AMONG OTHER ISSUES THE WORKING GROUP A DEVELOPED A LIST OF ITEMS THAT THEY DETERMINED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL CERTAIN CONTROLS PRIOR TO THEIR TRANSFER TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. LATE LAST SUMMER HOWEVER THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTEEN SIX EIGHTY EIGHT ALONG WITH MANY OF THE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS GOVERNING APPROPRIATE CONSTITUTIONALLY SOUND USES. OF THE CONTROLLED EQUIPMENT. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE REQUIRES ALL OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BY THEIR GOVERNING BODIES MEANING CITY COUNCILS OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PRIOR TO APPLYING. A TO RECEIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT SURPLUS PROGRAM. BY REQUIRING A PUBLIC FORUM FOR OPEN TO ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THE BILL INTENDS TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMMUNITIES HAVE WITH THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. SO THAT THEY'RE SEEN AS A PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICE PART OF AN OCCUPYING FORCE. THROUGH THE CHAIR LIKE TO TURN NOW TO OUR JOINT AUTHOR AND MISTER CHIU OF FOR SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ALONG WITH OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AYE AND I'M CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THE WEAPONS THAT ARE CARRIED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARCH REFLECT THAT PARTNERSHIP. OUR CITIZENS ARE NOT ENEMY COMBATANTS OUR POLICE ARE NOT MILITARY GENERALS IT'S IMPORTANT AND THIS BILL DOES IS TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THE NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY. ARE ON WHY AND WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD NEED TO ACQUIRE MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS. UP WE ARE HERE IN PART BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD REPEAL. A PREVIOUS EXECUTIVE ORDER. FROM OUR PRIOR PRESIDENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT HAS NECESSITATED THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STEP IN AND WITH THAT. OUT ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ALSO THANK THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL AS WELL. INCLUDING INDIVISIBLE THAT HAD BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. THIS WAS SOMETHING I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING FORWARD UNTIL THEY FOUND OUT THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO IS DOING IT WE'VE DECIDED TO JOIN FORCES. YOU MAY COME GO IT. THE MONEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE MY NAME IS YOU NEED A CONSISTENT WITH THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE NATION'S LARGEST MUSLIM CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION MUSLIMS? AND A THIRD OF OUR MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A VERY LARGE. REFUGEE POPULATIONS. CENTERED AND THE SACRAMENTO AREA OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN LATELY IN IN IN THE NEWS REGARDING SO FONG CLARK AND MANY OF OUR OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE REALLY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE IN A TIME WHERE WE NEED TO MEND. RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT AND IN REGARDS TO A REFUGEE COMMUNITY WE HAVE MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE NEW TO THIS COUNTRY FLEEING WAR. WAR ZONES SEEING TANKS FREQUENTLY IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SEEING MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS AND LIKE HAVING THAT. POTENTIALLY IN OUR STREETS WITHOUT PUBLIC COMMENT WITH A PUBLIC FORUM WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY. I I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY CONDUCIVE TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE THINK OF BRINGING OUR COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND AND CREATING SAFE SPACES. AND REALLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WHAT IT WOULD PREVENT THE BLURRING OF THE LINES REACHING OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MILITARY LIKE REALLY RECOGNIZING. LIKE WHO IS SERVING US VERSUS WHO IS PROTECTING US OVERSEAS AND AND WHAT NOT. AND WE AT CARE A SUPPORT. A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE AND WE WOULD URGE IVA. THANK YOU. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS  THE BATON ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE BECAUSE IT BRINGS NECESSARY LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PROCESS OF ACQUIRING DANGEROUS COSTLY DIVISIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT. IT FILLS AN IMPORTANT GAP IN AS YOU KNOW AS WE'VE HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER PARTLY RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS IN OUR NATIONAL POLICING OF VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAD TWO CATEGORIES OF EQUIPMENT ONE LIST OF EQUIPMENT WAS TRANSFERRED WAS PROHIBITED TO TO. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THEN THE OTHER WAS A LIST OF ITEMS FOR WHICH MUNICIPALITIES HOW TO SUBMIT A DETAILED JUSTIFICATION OUTLINING THEIR NEEDS FOR THE EQUIPMENT. AND THE CERTIFICATION THAT TRAINING AND USE POLICIES WERE IN PLACE PRIOR TO RECEIVING EQUIPMENT. AND THE SAFEGUARDS ARE CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY AS YOU ALL KNOW BY BUILDING TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. SO UNFORTUNATELY AS WE'VE HEARD THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. UNDER THE TEN THIRTY THREE PROGRAM CALIFORNIAN AGENCIES HAVE ALREADY ACQUIRED TEN COMBAT WHEELED VEHICLES FORTY FOUR MINE RESISTANT VEHICLES THIRTY NINE ARMORED TRUCKS ALMOST SIX THOUSAND FIVE POINT FIVE SIX MILLIMETER RIFLES AND ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT SIX TWO MILLIMETRE RIFLES. THIS IS Y. A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE IS SO CRITICAL. IT WOULD PLACE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO ACQUIRE MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. IT WOULD PERMIT THESE OFFICIALS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE COST OF ACQUIRING USING AND MAINTAINING MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS TRULY WARRANTED. IT WOULD REQUIRE AGENCIES TO CONSIDER AND WORK TO PREVENT THE DISPARATE IMPACT THE POLICE EQUIPMENT HOUSE ON CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. MOST OFTEN AS WE KNOW PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ASSIST IN THE CRITICAL WORK OF ENCOURAGING OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE THEY SERVE. IS OPPOSED TO ADOPTING A WARRIOR MENTALITY FROM WITHIN A TANK OR BEHIND A GRENADE LAUNCHER. THE CRITICALLY IT WOULD NOT PREEMPTIVELY BAND TRANSFER OF ANY SPECIFIC KIND OF EQUIPMENT WHICH IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. RATHER IT WOULD PLACE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE EQUIPMENT IS TRULY NEEDED IN THE HANDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS THAT THE SO YOU THINK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP STANDS BEHIND THE BUILDING URGES YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI MY NAME'S TOGETHER HEARING I'M I'M HERE WITH INDIVISIBLE CALIFORNIA STATE STRONG OR A COALITION OF OVER. HUNDREDS OF. LOCAL GRASSROOTS GROUPS REPRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT AND COSPONSORED LISTA. YES. MARGOT GEORGE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JIM WEINBERGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA CO SPONSOR AND IN SUPPORT URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK S FOR THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. DANIEL CANDA KAISER ON BEHALF OF ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. YESTERDAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RICH POOR SOULS ALONG HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THE CONCERN WE REYES WITH THIS ISSUE. AND PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. TO HACK THE SORT OF POLICY AT THE STATE LEVEL. ON IS THAT. THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS OF APPROVAL POT WILL SLOW DOWN LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ACQUIRE THIS EQUIPMENT AND THE PROPONENTS WILL SAY WELL YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO IT ONCE OR YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A POLICY AND THEN IT'S NOT. REQUIRED FOR EACH TIME YOU ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT BUT EVEN FOR THAT FIRST TIME YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ARDUOUS PROCESS OF SAYING WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO ACQUIRE. THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM OR THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF FIREARM OR HELICOPTER OR AIRPLANE. IN TWO TO IMPOSE THAT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BURDENSOME NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO. HELICOPTERS AND AIRPLANES. I MEAN THERE ARE SOME THINGS ON HERE THAT SOUND SCARIER THAN OTHERS LIKE TRACKED ARMORED VEHICLES BUT HELICOPTERS AND FIXED WING AIRCRAFT OR USE ROUTINELY IN POLICE WORK. FOR THE SAFETY AND BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECTS. THE DEFINITIONS IN THIS BILL ARE VAGUE AT BEST FOR SOME ITEMS. A FIREARM OR A FIREARM ACCESSORY THAT IS DESIGNED TO LAUNCH SMALL EXPLOSIVE PROJECTILES I DON'T KNOW A TON ABOUT GUNS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT QUALIFIES AS THAT EVERY FIREARM. IS INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION THAT'S WHAT FIREARMS DO THEY LAUNCH SMALL EXPLOSIVE PROJECTILES. SO IF THAT'S NOT THE INTENT THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT. THE BILL ALSO IMPLICATES LONG RANGE ACOUSTIC DEVICES. THAT A BULLHORN. THE HERB SO WE CAN ACQUIRE BULL HORNS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I AYE IF THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AGAIN THE BILL SHOULD BE pNOT WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO COVER THAT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. BUT AGAIN THE DRAFTING OF IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AT THE VERY LEAST. AND EVEN IS ALL OF THESE LOGISTICAL OR DRAFTING ISSUES ARE CLARIFIED THE BOTTOM LINE IS. SHERIFFS ARE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT'S BEST IN TERMS OF POLICING TECHNIQUES EQUIPMENT. AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS APPROVAL OR OVERSIGHT NECESSARILY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS BUDGETARY AUTHORITY. THAT'S ONE ISSUE BUT SHERIFFS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO POLICE AND TO DO WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHOULD HAVE. APPROVAL AUTHORITY OVER TACTIC. TECHNICAL ISSUES AND TACTICS AND FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR A VOTE PICTURE. THANK YOU. YES. JEFF MATTHEWS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. PRETTY PAYER THERE AND READ HIS HOUSE HAD SOME HALF A POINT I CAN OPPOSITION. JOHN THE VILLAIN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION APOLOGIES TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR LETTER WAS NOT SUBMITTED IN TIME WE TOOK LA POSITION BUT WE ARE OPPOSED THANK. THANK YOU. RANCHERO THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. BUT I'M NOT YOU CYBERLINK WE HAVE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AND. ARE YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISTER LACKEY. YOU'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER THAN TO BE A FAIRLY DIRECT. FIRST OF ALL I'D I TAKE. OVER ITS WITH THE FACT THAT I I THINK THAT. THIS KIND OF BILL FEEDS THE TENSION. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED PROTECT. IT SENDS. THIS. AND YOU CAN SHAKE YOUR HEAD OUT THERE ALL YOU WANT BUT I JUST IS TRULY WHAT I BELIEVE. AND. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE. TAKE A POSITION THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT EXISTS TO DEFEND A NOT TO ATTACK. AND WE HAVE THIS REALLY UGLY PHENOMENON IN THE WORLD TODAY CALLED TERRORISM. AND JUST TO THINK THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE EXEMPT FROM THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS. IS RIDICULOUS. AND WE NEED. TO JUST BE MORE DIRECT EVERYBODY AND WE NEED TO HAVE WE NEED TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND. I THINK OF THESE KINDS OF MEASURES. VALIDATE. THE. THE YOUNG FORTUNATE. CIRCUMSTANCE OF PEOPLE SEE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AS. OPPRESSORS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE TO. UNDERMINE THEIR HAPPINESS WHEN IN FACT OF THEIR TO DEFENDED AND DIE. FOR THOSE PEOPLE. THAT. DON'T TRUST THEM. AND SO I. MY SECOND OPPOSITION IS THE EXTREME CHARACTERIZATION WHAT'S MILITARY GRADE. CAMOUFLAGE. YEAR. BATONS. AND THAT THESE TYPES OF TOOLS ARE NECESSARY TO DEFEND. INNOCENT PEOPLE AND SO I I WOULD WISH THAT. WE COULD. TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TWO OF MENDING RELATIONSHIPS ARE SORT OF THIS KIND OF BILL. THANK YOU. BUT ANY OTHER COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE. I. FIGURES CHAIRMAN I I WILL LE. I THINK THE BILL SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I STILL RESPECT MY COLLEAGUE WHO HAS IT PERHAPS A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW A DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR WHY THIS BILL MAY BE NECESSARY. OF MY TIME ON THE CITY COUNCIL I'M I WOULD WANT THIS AUTHORITY TO BE GIVEN TO ME A TO MAKE THAT DECISION IN A PUBLIC A TRANSPARENT MANNER. OUR MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR THERE IS A DISTINCTION IN THIS BILL THAT WAS NOT IN THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE ORDER. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE ACQUISITION OF ANY OF THESE KINDS OF PIECES OF EQUIPMENT BUT IT DOES REQUIRE A PUBLIC HEARING FOR IT. AND MUCH AS A SHARE OF HAS TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO REQUEST HIS OR HER BUDGET I'M WHICH DOES DICTATE THE NUMBER OF. AT ALL EVERY KIND OF TACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONCERNED THAT THEY MAY HAVE YOU KNOW MONEY IS HOW THOSE THINGS ARE OFTEN PLAYED OUT. A JUSTIFICATION ASKING FOR SOME THE PROCESS I THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IS NOT ABOUT PROHIBITION IT'S BY ASKING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT BY THAN SIMPLY JUST COLLECTING THE EQUIPMENT. LOW HAPPY GOING FOR THE DATE DETAIL FOR THE COMMITTEE ANY TIME ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK UP TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF. THAT SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS I THINK THAT'S A FAIR OBSERVATION UMP IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THESE ARE THE UP PUBLIC HEARING IS WHAT IS TAKING TO CONFIRM A POLICE CHIEFS OUR PUBLIC PROCESS IS WHAT'S TAKEN TO CONFIRM OR APPROPRIATE A BUDGET. ON THIS IS NO DIFFERENT ON BUT THIS DOES INCREASE THE PARTS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WHICH I THINK IS SO VERY IMPORTANT THIS POINT IN TIME. PARTICULARLY AFTER THE RECENT RECESSION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE IS AN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. JUST A COUPLE OF OF OF QUICK THOUGHTS A I ALSO VERY MUCH RESPECT OF THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VICE CHAIR AND AND YEAR EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARM. AND AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO WORKED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE DA SIDE I THINK WE DO HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE OF PERSPECTIVE AND HOW WE LOOK AT THIS. THAT WE ALL SHARE THE GOALS OF ENSURING THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE FROM TERRORISM. BUT IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THERE SIGNIFICANT DISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND. ARE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE TENSION THAT I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO HAS BEEN REALLY FUEL BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION REVERSED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. OF THAT HAD ALLOWED FOR SOME TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMUNITIES TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF A MILITARY GRADE A EQUIPMENT IS GOING INTO OUR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE AROUND PROCESS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CAN'T MOVE QUICKLY ON IF THEY ARE SO COMPELLED AND COULD SET UP PROCEDURES OUGHT TO PRE APPROVE OR OTHERWISE ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WANTED TO PASS ON. MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT THAT COMMUNITIES WOULD BE READY TO DO THAT THAT IS. NOT FORBIDDEN UNDER THIS LEGISLATION AND I WOULD JUST REITERATE AS MY. COLLEAGUES AT FROM SAN DIEGO THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PREVENTS ANY OF THIS EQUIPMENT FROM GOING TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES OR SAYING IS THAT WE NEED. A LITTLE BIT OF TRANSPARENCY A LITTLE BIT OF ACCOUNTABILITY A LITTLE BETTER PROCESS AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU HARM AND I AGREE WITH THE VICE CHAIR. THAT THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS ARE HERE TO DEFEND. AND NOT ATTACK. AND WE NEED TO TO WORK MORE ON THAT. IRONICALLY I THINK YOUR BILL COULD HELP US GET TO THAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD TRANSPARENCY. EVEN IF. OF A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR LOCAL CITY COUNCIL APPROVES. SOME TYPE OF MILITARY GRADE OR WHATEVER FALL TO TED DEFINITION. IF THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND IS VOTED ON AND RESIDENTS SEE IT AS A UNNECESSARY. PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN HAVING TO SHOW UP. AND A COMMUNITY AND THEY NOT KNOW BAD. THAT IS THE TYPE OF. FORCE PROTECTIVE SAID THEY WILL BE USING. TRANSPARENCY IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT AND I DO KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN MOVE QUICKLY. I WOULD SAY THE NOTION. THAT. LAWMAKERS. COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES IS IS KIND OF LOCUSTS. I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT FOR QUITE AWHILE. AND IT'S. AT I KNOW IT THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE WHO MAKE LAWS ALSO. ON DECIDE TO BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND DECIDE HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE DISPERSED. SOBRE RATHER HAVE US WORKING. HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER. TOOK TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THAT I THINK THIS BILL HELPS US GET TO THAT. AS OPPOSED TO BEING MAKE IT MORE PROBLEMATIC THE MORE OPEN WE ARE WITH WITH. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY. AND THE MORE OPEN YOU ARE WITH THE PUBLIC. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT THAT. WHATEVER EQUIPMENT IS NEEDED TO KEEP NOT ONLY CITIZENS SAFE BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OF OFFICERS SAFE. WILL BE ON A GREAT ASSET SO THAT THAT THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. MR MOST. TAKEN BY MISTER QUIRK. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARDIO. CATALOGUER DEATH GALLAGHER DEATH AYE KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THE MEASURES ON CALL TANK YOU. ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT MISS MELENDEZ GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT TO YOU THIS MORNING. AFTER SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN PARKLAND FLORIDA THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IN FEBRUARY NEARLY FIFTY SCHOOLS REPORTED VIOLENT THREATS THAT SAME MONTH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALONE. A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HELMET HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WAS ARRESTED FOR WRITING HIM AT HIGH WILL BE SHOT UP ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BY SOPHOMORE GIRL. NO CHARGES WERE PRESSED AGAINST HER EVEN THOUGH PARENTS DID NOT SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR. A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD MIRA COSTA MESA. ARMS ARE A NEAR COSTA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WAS ARRESTED AFTER HE POSTED A PHOTO OF HIMSELF POINTING A GUN AT HIS CLASSMATES ON SNAPCHAT. NO CHARGES WERE PRESSED AGAINST HIM. AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD EL CAMINO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WAS ARRESTED AFTER SECURITY GUARD OVERHEARD HIM TELLING HIS FRIEND HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT UP THE SCHOOL SOMETIME WITHIN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS. NO CHARGES WERE PRESSED AGAINST HIM EVEN THOUGH THEY FOUND THEY ARE FIFTEEN RIFLES IN HIS HOUSE. HE CLAIMED THE GUNS WERE HIS BROTHERS AND HIS BROTHERS HAVING CHARGES AGAINST HIM FOR OWNING ILLEGAL WEAPONS. SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO PREVENT THESE HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS THEN WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AND PROACTIVE ON IDENTIFYING LEGITIMATE THREATS AND THOSE WISHING TO CAUSE HARM. CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME ONLY TO SPECIFICALLY THREATEN A PARTICULAR PERSON OR MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY BUT NOT TO THREATEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR A PERSON TO MAKE VIOLENT THREATS VERBALLY IN WRITING OR BY SOCIAL MEDIA AGAIN SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP. IF THE SIGNS ARE THERE INACTION SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION THE PRICE IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN MANY CASES. THIS OTHER THIS BILL ALSO OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEDICAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO INTERVENE TO GET SOME OF THESE KIDS THE HELP THAT THEY MAY VERY WELL NEED THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NOT GET IN THE HOPES THAT THEY DON'T CONTINUE DOWN A ROAD. OF. DESTRUCTION. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TARA URBAN ON BEHALF OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MY CAST TRAIN AND VIVIAN WHITE TO WILL TESTIFY SECOND SHE WAS AS SHE IS A STUDENT MCCLATCHY HIGH SCHOOL. ISSUE WE SHARING HER PERSONAL STORY OF THE VIOLENT THREAT MADE MCCLATCHY HIGH SCHOOL IN FEBRUARY. BY A STUDENT WHO ALSO WAS NOT ARRESTED FOR THAT THREAT. THANK IT WHEN THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. GOOD MORNING AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TARA URBAN AND I GET TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. TODAY CHILDREN. ARE AFRAID TO ATTEND SCHOOL. FOR FEAR OF BEING SHOT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ARE PLAGUING OUR SOCIETY. IN THE ECHOES OF FIRE JUST OF SHOTS FIRED ARE THREATS THESE SCHOOL THREATS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER. AT AN ALARMING RATE. EVEN GREATER THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS ARE THE THREATS THAT ARE OCCURRING TO OUR SCHOOLS. WHICH HAVE. AND SIGNIFICANT OF FACTS PARENTS THE STUDENTS. IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PARK WHEN SHOOTING THAT OCCURRED JUST IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THEIR OVERSEE FIFTY THREATS IN ABOUT THIRTY THE CURRENT CRIMINAL THREATS STATUTE THAT WE HAVE DOES NOT PROTECT. OUR MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS OUR STUDENTS IN THE MOST VULNERABLE PLACES OUR SCHOOLS A PLACE WORST SHOULD FEEL SAFE. THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE ADDED TO THIS AND AMENDMENT IN THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED. TO CLOSE THE GAP IN CURRENT LAW. THIS LANGUAGE HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED BY OUR JUDICIARY. SYSTEM. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW PROSECUTORS CAN NOT FILE A FOUR TWENTY TO CHARGE THE CRIMINAL THREATS. AGAINST. WHEN THE SCHOOL OR CHURCH IS LISTED VICTIM THE LAW REQUIRES A PERSON TO BE THREATENED THAT PERSON TO BE AFRAID FOR HIM OR HERSELF. OR THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS IT DOES NOT OFFERS THE ABILITY TO BE AFRAID FOR THEIR CONGREGATION OR THEIR STUDENTS. AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS LIKE THE ONE LAST FRIDAY THAT JUST OCCURRED ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING. AND SCHEDULE PROTESTS AGAINST VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS WE SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS ASKING OURSELVES WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF SHOOTING THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE. THE ANSWER IS WE MUST INTERVENE. WE MUST INTERVENE BY CHANGING THE LANGUAGE AND FOR TWENTY TO TO FACILITATE PREVENTION. AND TO ELIMINATE THE DISPARITY IN THE LAW THAT PROTECTS ONLY ONE PERSON AND POTENTIALLY NOT THOUSANDS. WE NEED TO ANSWER THE SUSPECTS CRY FOR HELP BEFORE THE THREAT BECOMES AN ACTUAL SHOOTING. THIS AMENDMENT A SIGNIFICANT IN IT PROVIDES A STEP TO HELP GIVE OUR CHILDREN. OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITY THE PROTECTION THAT THEY DESERVE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THOUGH IN SUPPORT OF THIS NECESSARY AMENDMENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS VIVIAN Y. AND I'M STILL NOT SEEKING MCCLATCHY HIGH SCHOOL HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ON THE MORNING OF THE SHOOTING THAT IN MY SCHOOL I WASN'T WORRIED I'D SEEN POSTS ABOUT THE THREATEN PEOPLE WARNING US BE SAFE BUT I WAS SURE THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL. SO I WENT TO SCHOOL AS USUAL. WHEN I GOT MY FIRST PERIOD CLASSROOM I WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE ONLY HALF OF MY CLASS SITTING THERE BUT MOST PEOPLE HAD STAYED HOME. AND BEFORE THE BELL RANG TO START OUR FIRST CLASS STUDENTS ARE ALREADY BEING PULLED OUT OF SCHOOL BY THEIR PARENTS. I WATCHED JURASSIC PARK FIRST PERIOD TALK TO MY PARENTS FRIENDS SECOND AND THIRD AND PLAY MATH GAMES FOURTH THE TENDONS BEING TOO LOW FOR TEACHERS TO GET ANYTHING DONE. BY LUNCH THE HALLWAYS WERE ALMOST EMPTY. I FELT FAIRLY SAFE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY. BUT AT LUNCH WE GOT A CALL FROM A FRIEND WHO HAD GONE HOME. SAYING THAT THEY JUST BEEN CONTACTED ABOUT THE THREAT. SHE HAD ONE OF HER CLASSES WITH THE BOY WHO MADE THE THREAT. SO THEY ASK YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE. BUT THIS TIME IT SCARED US ALL. THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE THREAT WAS STILL GOING ON JUST MINUTES BEFORE FIFTH PERIOD WHEN THE SHOOTING WAS SAID TO HAPPEN. WE WERE ALL TERRIFIED. EVERY TIME THE LOUDSPEAKER WENT OFF CALLING OTHER STUDENTS GO THE OFFICE TO GET PICKED UP BY THE RIGHT FEELING WORRIED PARENTS WE FLINCH BECAUSE IN THE BACK OF OUR BRAIN WE THOUGHT THE INTRUDER ALARM MIGHT BE GOING ON. WHEN THE BELL RANG TO GO TO OUR AND BE SAFE PARTLY IS A DARK HUMOR JOKE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD AND PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED WE MIGHT NOT GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO TELL THEM. FIFTH PERIOD STARTED. MY BIOLOGY TEACHER LOCK THE DOOR AND WAS THAT THE TEACHERS AND GIVING HAD BEEN GIVEN CROWBARS JUST IN CASE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE THEY SAID YET THEY KEPT SAYING JUST IN CASE THERE SHOULD KNOW BETTER JUST IN CASE. IT WAS TRULY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE THERE SHOULD NEVER BE JUST IN CASE ONE HUNDRED OF STUDENTS LIVES ARE AT RISK. WE MADE IT THROUGH FIFTH PERIOD SAFELY BUT WE LOST A DAY OF EDUCATION WE LOST FAITH IN THE ADULTS BUT SHOULD BE PROTECTING US AND WE WHAT'S THE SENSE OF SECURITY WE SHOULD FEEL WHEN GOING TO SCHOOL. THE SADDEST PART IS THAT IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED AT OUR SCHOOL AND UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES IT WON'T BE THE LAST. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARI FILA COMBATANT GIFFORD LAW SENATE PLAGUE OF VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEW SOME HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. ORDER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARGOT GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ON I AGREE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO DO BE DONE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE PROFESSORS. FOUND THE RIGHT THING TO BE DONE AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT. THE CURRENT STATUTE PENAL CODE SECTION FOR TWENTY TO. IS ALREADY ONE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS ACROSS THE STATE. OF PENAL CODE SECTION FOR TWENTY TWO WAS THE SERIOUS FELONY AND IT'S A STRIKE SO THAT MEANS SICK ITS OWN CAN BE USED TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE A NEW SENTENCE. IT'S ALSO A STATUTE THAT'S ALSO OFTEN MISUSED TO PENALIZE CONDUCT THAT DOESN'T TRULY BELONG IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARM AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CLIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WHO OFTEN SUFFER FROM CRIPPLING PARANOIA AND DELUSIONS NOT TO INTERRUPT YOU MIGHT WEDNESDAY FOR TWENTY TWO IS TERRORIST THREATS? THANK YOU. PRISCILLA TERRORIST THREATS. THANK YOU BUT. SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FROM LOS ANGELES. OUR ROGER WHO IS A MARINE CORPS VET AND SUFFERS FROM PTSD AND BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. ON HE LIVES IN FLORIDA. BUT HE WAS HERE FOR OUR MARINE CORPS REUNION. HE DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH OF HIS MEDICATION AND AS A RESULT HE HAD AN EPISODE OF HEARING VOICES AND SMELLING DEAD BODIES. THAT REQUIRED HIM TO BE A FIFTY ONE FIFTIES THEN THAT'S TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL A MENTAL HOSPITAL. ON THEM OVERNIGHT. AFTER BEING HOSPITALIZED HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER FACILITY WHERE HE SAID VALUE WAITED BY A DOCTOR WHO TOLD THEM. THAT THE SYMPTOMS DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA AND THAT HE WOULD NEITHER BE ADMITTED NOR GIVEN ADDITIONAL MEDICATION. THE VET COMPLAIN THE MARINE VET COMPLAINED TO THE DISCHARGE PLANNER TELLING HER HE WAS IN NEED OF HELP AND WHAT COULD HE DO. SHE TOLD THEM WELL THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. YOU DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA FOR FIFTY ONE FIFTY ANYMORE. HE'S ASKED WHAT IS THE CRITERIA AND SHE TOLD HIM IT'S A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. HE TOLD HER HE THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING A GUN AND SHOOTING HIMSELF FOR THE STAFF. SHE CALLED THE POLICE THEY ARRESTED HIM FOR A FELONY. TERRORIST OR CRIMINAL THREATS. BRIAN WAS IN HIS FIFTIES AND MENTALLY ILL HE WAS OFFICE MEDICATION AND HE TOLD HIS FRIEND HE COULD BLOW THE BUILDING UP. SIMILAR TO THE SCHOOL ISSUES. HIS FRIEND CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. ASKING FOR HELP CAN WAS TRANSFERRED MOVE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE POLICE ARRIVED AND PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM FOR FOR TWENTY TWO. FOR TWENTY TO IS A STATUTE THAT ONLY REQUIRES WORDS NO ACTIONS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE THREAT. AND THAT APPLIES EVEN IF THE PERSON WHO WAS SAYING THE WORDS HAS NO INTENT OF ACTUALLY CARING ABOUT. FURTHER EXPANDING THIS ALREADY EXPANSIVE DEFINITION WELL WE FEAR ONLY AND SNEER MORE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE'RE CERTAINLY SYMPATHETIC. TWO THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL AND VOTE REAL FEAR THAT MOTIVATES SET. I UNDERSTAND THAT COMPLETELY. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ANSWER AND I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. YES. BRITTANY. OTHER. IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCOTT WALKER. QUESTION SO. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR. YOUR STORY. WE ARE CERTAINLY. IN ARE TIME WHERE. WE HAVE TO TAKE THESE THINGS SERIOUSLY. AND ALSO AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE TO BE HAVING ALL SORTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH ARE PARENTS WITH OUR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WITH THOSE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US. ABOUT HOW WE CAN CREATE THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE WANT TO LIVE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT. A NECESSITATE MORE LAW. BUT REALLY HOW WE DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO TREAT PEOPLE AND CO EXIST. MY QUESTION REALLY IS ABOUT THE BURDEN OF PROOF FOR THIS BILL AND WITH WHOM DOES IT LIE. SO IF I AM GOING TO SCHOOL. AND. I. I AM HAVING CHALLENGES WITH A TEACHER OR WITH A COUNSELOR OR EVEN WITH A FRIEND. AND SOMEONE MAKES AN ALLEGATION. THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING OR IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT. I SAY SOMETHING THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES. WITH WHOM CAN SOMEONE JUST DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HEY. SYDNEY TOLD ME SHE WAS GONNA BLOW ME UP IN THE BATHROOM BECAUSE. YOU KNOW OF X. Y. AND Z.. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION AS WITH ALL CRIMINAL CASES THE BURDEN OF PROOF INITIALLY LIES WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS DOING THE INVESTIGATION TO HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST THE SUSPECT. SO DON'T WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS IS THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST. NOW. WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR FILING AND I SHOULD SAY DID SERVE. FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ARE FILING UNIT REVIEWING CASES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PROSECUTE CASES. AND OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE REVIEWING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CAN WE PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT THE ELEMENTS ARE MEANT AND IT REQUIRES EACH AN HOUR EVERY ELEMENT OF THE CRIME. TO BE MET WITH ITS KIND OF PEOPLE LIKE IT TO A RECIPE AFTER HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS YOU CAN'T LEAVE OUT ONE. SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THEM WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE. CAN THE ELEMENTS OR BROKEN DOWN INTO JURY INSTRUCTIONS IS THEIR FACTS THAT GO TO EACH AND EVERY ELEMENT. WHEN LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY A CRIMINAL THREAT STATUE WHICH WAS AMENDED SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO INCLUDE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING TIMES. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. NOW THAT THEY CAN BE DONE BY SOCIAL MEDIA SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE EACH AND EVERY ELEMENT IS THERE. THE BURDEN IS ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THOSE ELEMENTS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. WHEN THE ONLY THING THAT THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE IS NOT THE BURDEN OF PROOF OR ANYTHING ABOUT THE LA OTHER THEN IT WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW. THE TARGET OF THE THREAT TO INCLUDE. SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES. CURRENTLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIFIC THREAT AGAINST A SPECIFIC PERSON. SO I WAS TALKING TO MY TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS ALL INTO POLITICS OF SHE'S GOING TO BE SUPER EXCITED TO WATCH THIS. WAVING AT HER RIGHT NOW. SO. SHE IS I WAS TALKING TO HER ABOUT IT AND I SAID OKAY IF SOMEBODY CAME TO YOUR SCHOOL. AND THEY THREATENED YOUR PRINCIPAL AND THEY SAID I'M GONNA KILL THE PRINCIPLE. AND THE PRINCIPAL WAS AFRAID THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY CHARGED UNDER FOR TWENTY TWO OF A CRIMINAL THREAT. UNDER OUR CURRENT LAW. HOWEVER IF THAT SEEMS STUDENT SAID I'M GOING TO GO AND BLOW UP. HER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT WOULDN'T QUALIFY AND NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION IT HAS TO BE A PERSON. THAT IS THE TARGET OF THE OFFENSE AND THE PERSON THAT IS. HAS TO BE AFRAID FOR THEMSELVES. OR FOR SOMEONE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE SCHOOL. SO WHAT THIS WHAT THAT MY DAUGHTER SAID WHEN SHE HEARD THIS WAS WELL HOLD ON A SECOND. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONE IF A KID THREATENS ONE KID THAT ONE KID IS PROTECTED. BUT IF THE. KID THREATENS ALL OF THE KIDS TO ALL TWELVE HUNDRED OF THEM THEN ALL TWELVE HUNDRED OF THOSE KIDS ARE NOT PROTECTED. AND SHE WENT. ARE YOU SERIOUS MUM AND THAT'S WHO YOU KNOW SHE CAN TALK STATIONS LIKE WELL THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AND I'M LIKE WELL RIGHT NOW THE LAW REQUIRES THE PROSECUTION TO IDENTIFY. A VICTIM SOMEBODY WHO CAN SAY HEY THIS IS THE VICTIM OF THIS CRIME AND THIS PERSON WAS AFRAID FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY. THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT ALLOWS US TO WIN AS A THREAT IS MADE TO A SCHOOL FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED. UNDER THIS SECTION NOT AUTOMATICALLY PROSECUTED BUT CONSIDERED BECAUSE NOW THE TARGET CAN BE THE SCHOOL. FOR THE CHURCH AND IT CAN BE THE ADMINISTRATOR THAT IS IN FEAR FOR THE CONGREGATION OR FOR THE SCHOOL. AND SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT PROPOSES. AND SO DOESN'T NECESSARILY CHANGE THE BURDEN. THANK YOU. IT DOESN'T EXPAND THE REACH IT JUST ALLOWS EIGHTIES. PERSON TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THREATENING TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS VERSUS WHAT. MISTER LECHNER MISTER KILEY WHICH ONE. MIND BE QUICK I JUST WONDER AS THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT HOWARD THREATS HAVE IMPACTED HIM OBVIOUSLY CAME A DISTANCE TO SHARE SOMETHING SO IF I COULD HEAR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HARRIS. I'VE ACTUALLY JUST HERE MOSTLY IN SUPPORT OF MY DAUGHTER BUT I AM A A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER HEARINGS EGGMAN. AND. IT DEFINITELY HAS. AFFECTED ME NOT AYE ONGOING BASIS I I TEACH FOURTH GRADE. I TEACH FOURTH GRADE AND. HAVING TO DISCUSS SCHOOL VIOLENCE WITH THE CHILDREN THAT AGE IS A. CONSTANT BURDEN AND. I THINK IT'S INEXCUSABLE THAT. WE COULDN'T PROSECUTE. PEOPLE WHO. MAKE THESE THREATS NAY THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION RESCUE SHARE. MISTER KILEY. I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS I'VE HEARD AFTER AND D. A.'S OFFICES IN MY OWN DISTRICT ABOUT THIS VERY PROBLEM THAT REALIZE THAT. THERE IS THIS GAP IN THE LAW THAT WE HAVE NO WAY. TO TO TACKLE THIS INCREASINGLY. YOU KNOW. SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I YOU KNOW THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY THE LAW SHOULD OF ALL WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW. EXPANDING THINGS WERE JUST CORRECTING FOR AN OVERSIGHT. WITH THIS BILL AND THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE ALL KNOW AS WE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY HOW SERIOUS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE THREATS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE FEAR THAT INSPIRES AMONG THE STUDENT BODY IN TERMS OF THE DISRUPTION. TO THE SCHOOL AND THAT SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY SOLID AND COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND I MISTER CHAIR I AM VERY PLEASED TO MOVE ABOUT. NO THE COMMENTS OF. YOU MAKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE YOUR 'M ATTENTION TO THE WITNESSES WHO CAME ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK. MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR ME IN THIS BILL THAN ANY OTHER THING THAT IT DIES IS THE ABILITY THAT IT WILL LOOK FORWARD TO INTERVENE WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH. THIS THIS ALLOWS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET TO A STUDENT PERHAPS AND GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED BEFORE THIS GOES DOWN THE WRONG PATH RIGHT. AND THIS IS A BILL THAT COIN. THIS JUST CHANGES IT TO. IT'S A WILD BOAR COULD BE MISDEMEANOR COULD BE A FELONY IT'S A LOT MORE BUT THIS THIS GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A JUDGE TO SAY OKAY YOU NEED TO GO AND GET SOME TYPE OF TREATMENT BECAUSE WE THINK. YOU ARE SAY EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES HERE. SOME VIOLENT TENDENCIES AND WE WANT TO GET THAT CORRECTED WORRIES RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY. WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT UNLESS. IT WAS A STUDENT GOES TO SCHOOL AND SAYS I'M GOING TO SHOOT. JANE DOE. THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T CHARGE. THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO UNDER THE SPELLING INTERVENE. AND THAT'S I THINK IT WAS. REALLY A GREAT STATEMENT TO MAKE BY. MY WITNESSES DAUGHTER THAT. IF YOU THREATEN ONE STUDENT. VAN LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL INTERVENE IN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN INTERVENE IF YOU THREATEN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL. EVERYONE IS LEFT TO WORRY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR THING TO DO OUR STUDENTS IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A FAIR THING TO DO OUR PARENTS. THIS HAPPENED AT MY OWN CHILDREN'S SCHOOL WHERE I MEAN ONE THREAT COMES DOWN AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW. ALTHOUGH THE PARENTS ARE LOSING THEIR MINDS ARE PULLING THEIR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL THERE'S THEN THEY TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEN IT GROWS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER IN THIS IN THE FEAR. JUST CONTINUES TO SPREAD SO I THINK WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THIS THAT WE DON'T DO. THE INTENT ISN'T TO. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GET ARRESTED OR INCARCERATE THAT'S NOT IT THE INTENT IS TO STOP THESE. TYPES OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING IN INTERVENE WHEN WE CAN'T TO GET THESE KIDS THE HELP THAT WE. BECAUSE REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SOMEONE WHO MAKES. A THREAT LIKE THAT AGAINST THEIR SCHOOL OR THEIR CHURCH OBVIOUSLY. SOMETHING'S WRONG IN THEIR MINDS. WHICH IS CAUSING THEM TO FEEL THE WAY THEY DO. I'D LIKE FOR US TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT. SO THAT A TRAGEDY DOESN'T TAKE PLACE IN THAT PERSON. I. GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK THE TELEMATICA FOUR AM WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I A GET ON ONE OF LUIS THANK THE WITNESSES. FOR COMING IN TODAY YOUR ELOQUENT. VERY PASSIONATE YOUR DIRECT AND I'D. AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID WE PROBABLY NEED TO LISTEN. TWO MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THAN TO ADULTS. ON ON PROBABLY MOST OF THE BILLS WE DO. AROUND HERE. BECAUSE YOU'RE FRANKLIN USED. A POINT AND. YOU SPEAK FROM HONESTY. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY. OF. AND TO THE FATHER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ALSO. YOUR SEVERAL LEGISLATORS AND I WERE IN THE AIRPORT RIGHT AFTER PARKLAND SHOOTING. AND A FATHER OVERHEARD US TALKING ABOUT LAWS AND DIFFERENT THINGS WERE WORKING ON. AND HE SAID ARE YOU GUYS. LAWMAKERS ARE YOU GUYS SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO'S EVER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALONG WITH SENATOR ANDY ASKED. SO WOULD YOU DOING ABOUT THE PARKLAND. SHOOTINGS AND WE SAID WELL WHAT WE GET THIS BILL IN THAT BILL AND I. OUR OUR CHESTS WERE ALL POKED OUT. REALLY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. AND HE LOOKED AT HIS SAID. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT WOULD YOU DOING NOW. AND IT KIND OF EMBARRASSED ASSAULT GROUP YOU SAID YOU NEED TO DO MORE BECAUSE I HAVE TWO. KIDS ARE GETTING READY TO GO TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND I'M SCARED TO DEATH. TO HAVE THEM GO TELEPICTURES AND WE'RE SCARED FOR THEM ALSO. SO OF AYE AYE AYE CREATE. ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE GUN VIOLENCE. PLAN TO HAVE MY OWN. BRIEFING ON THIS.

TO REDUCE SENSES FOR DEFENDANTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR REHABILITATION. CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW HOUSES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND INMATES WE SPEND MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. ON STATE PRISONS AND WHILE PUBLIC ST GERMAIN TO KEEP PRIORITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS EMERGING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT WE. SHOULD REVISIT PALACE POLICIES FAR THOUGHT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE BEST PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES. IN FACT RESEARCH FROM THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE FROM THAT PRISON SENSES COULD BE SHORTENED BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD. WITHOUT CAUSING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. TODAY THERE ARE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE FOUND A CERTAIN PRISON SENTENCE UPON FURTHER IF YOU ARE NO LONGER. IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND WORE A LESSER LEGAL SENSE. HOWEVER PROSECUTORS DO NOT HAVE ANY DISCRETION TO REMEDY THESE CASES. ABOUT THIS SPELL ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECALL. AND RESENTING OF DEFENDANTS PROVIDED THAT THE DEFENDANT'S BEHAVIOR IS NOT A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE INDICATING THEIR REHABILITATION. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO REALLY ENSURE THAT PROSECUTORS CONTINUE TO. DO THEIR PART AND PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY AT THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING THEIR REHABILITATION AND. DEFENDANTS ARE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WITHOUT I'VE TWO WITNESSES BY DAVID ANGELL WHO'S REPRESENTING SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN AND HILLARY PLOT. YES. I GOOD MORNING THANK YOU OUT FIRST. OF MY JOB MY BOSS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN HAD INTENDED TO BE HERE BUT HE SAID. ATTENDING TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS GRAVELY ILL ASA SENDS HIS REGRETS BUT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM. TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL WHICH IS WHY HE ASKED ME TO SPEAK ON HIS DAD. I WANT TO TOUCH ON ESSENTIALLY TWO POINTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS. OUR OFFICE WAS ACTUALLY BE I BELIEVE THE FIRST THE COUNTRY CERTAINLY THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO ESTABLISH A CONVICTION INTEGRITY UNIT. AND DOT BACK AND WE DID THAT WE WE GOT ACTUALLY FOR AMOUNT OF PUSH BACK. FROM FOLKS WERE CONCERNED SINGLE WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS IS A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ISN'T THIS JOB FOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER OR OR A GOVERNOR IF THEY WANT COMMUTER SENTENCE. BUT WE REALIZE THAT THERE WERE RARE CASES A BOTTOM VITAL IMPORTANT ONES WE HAD NEW EVIDENCE THAT MADE US REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE CONVICTION. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID GIVES US THE TOOLS TO DO IT? BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE RARE BUT VITAL CASES WERE NEW EVIDENCE IS GOING TO COME TO LIGHT THAT SUGGESTS THE SENTENCE ITSELF WAS ON JUST. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE FROM OUR COUNTY THAT WE JUST RECENTLY WORKED ON. AND THAT WAS THE CASE OF AN MISTER OR NO FULL GARCIA. HE WAS SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN SAN QUENTIN DUE TO A SERIES OF DRUG INDUCED BURGLARIES FROM EARLIER IN HIS LIFE. OVER TIME MISTER GARCIA FACED HIS INNER DEMONS AND TAMED HIS HEROIN ADDICTION AND HE WORKED HARD BECAME A CHANGED MAN I ACTUALLY MET HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SAN QUENTIN. HE WAS EVEN WETTER EDITOR OF THE AWARD WINNING SAN QUENTIN NEWSPAPER. AND PERHAPS MOST INSTRUCTED ME AS A PROSECUTOR IS ONE OF THE TOP TO THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM SAN QUENTIN MEN. WHO SAW HIM EVERY DAY? THEY WONDERED WHY HE WAS STILL THERE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THERE IS REALLY A NEED FOR IT. AND YET THERE IS REALLY KNOW A CLEAR LEGAL PATH TO BRING THAT CASE BACK IN FRONT OF A JUDGE THAT. EVALUATION TO BE MADE BASED ON THE NEW THOSE NEW FACTS. THIS LAW WHICH CHANGE THAT IT WOULD GIVE US THAT LEGAL MECHANISM. I KNOW MY FELLOW DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PROSECUTORS HAVE MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. BUT. FROM TALKING TO FOLKS I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS AN ARE NO FOR GARCIA. THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY'VE PROSECUTOR THEIR OFFICES PROSECUTED WHERE THEY PONDERED WHETHER HE REALLY OF THAT PERSON REALLY NEEDS TO BE IMPRISONED ANYMORE. I. THE LAST ISSUE I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON IN THIS BRIEF TIME. I IS JUST ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN JUST TO REMINDER DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I EASE USUALLY HERE SHE IS USUALLY THE HIGHEST RANKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IS OFFICIAL AND I COUNTY AND AS SUCH I THINK UNIQUELY SITUATED TO TO BALANCE THE EQUITIES AS THE COMMUNITY SEES FED. SO I DON'T SEE THIS IS A. A RADICALIZED IT IS A A CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT ADDS A TOOL. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES. BUT IT'S ALSO IF YOU SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THE BOARD OF PAROLE WHO IS THE POWER TO RECALL A SENTENCE ALL THIS WOULD DO WOULD BE TO ADD ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BUT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY. SO I THINK FOR BOTH THOSE REASONS THIS WOULD BE REALLY GOOD LAW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IF YOU HAD GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MY NAME IS HILARY BLOW OUT I'M A FORMER PROSECUTOR HERE FROM CALIFORNIA BUT I SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WORKING. DIRECTLY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS POLICY INITIATIVES REALLY TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT I BELIEVE IS. IT CRITICAL FOR ALL OF US TO CONSIDER IS PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO BALANCING THAT WITH THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND ALSO TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM OUR OVER RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION AS A MEANS OF MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. SO THIS BILL REALLY STRIKES A BALANCE OF ALL OF THOSE GOALS I'M WE WERE CAREFUL IN DRAFTING THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE KEEPING IN MIND THE SENSITIVITIES AROUND COURTS AND THE SCARCE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE. ON AND SO THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW PROCESSES INSTEAD IT LEVERAGES AN EXISTING PROCESS. THERE WHERE COURTS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE IN CONSIDERING PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALL IT DOES MERELY IS ADDED THE DA'S TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE SAME DISCRETION THAT THE EXERCISE AT THE OUTSET OF THE CASE. AT THE FRONT END BUT ALSO AT THE BACKEND. THANKFULLY WE'VE HAD SEVERAL DIFFERENT LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED THAT CREATE ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS WHO ARE SUITABLE FOR RELEASE BUT I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT THAT BURDEN THAT FALLS ON THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS. IS A GREAT ONE AND SO ANY OTHER ENTITY ESPECIALLY SOME AN ENTITY LIKE THE DA'S OFFICE THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN IDENTIFYING OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHERE IT FURTHER CONFINEMENT ISN'T WARRANTED. IS A IS A BENEFIT AND CAN HELP TO ACTUALLY EASE THE BURDEN ALSO MOVE IN DIRECTION OF REDUCING OUR OVERRELIANCE ON INCARCERATION. WHILE DEA'S IN IN THIS BILL ARE AFFORDED BROAD DISCRETION TO ADDRESS ANY INJUSTICE ANY UNJUST CONFINEMENT. ON IT IS LIKELY THAT. THE THE THE POPULATIONS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO ELEVATE AND HIGHLIGHT ARE THOSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING LONG TERM SENTENCES. PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING LONG TERM SENTENCES IN CALIFORNIA ARE THE HIGHEST NUMBER THE HIGH SHEAR NUMBER IN THE COUNTRY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT NUMBER ALSO INCLUDES A VERY HIGH NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE SERVING. LONG TERM SENTENCES FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSES AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THAT POPULATION WE'VE GOT A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON RIGHT NOW WHO ARE SERVING BEEN CENSORED TWENTY YEARS OR MORE. FOR NON VIOLENT OFFENSE HALF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALREADY SERVED FIFTY PERCENT OF THAT TIME WHICH IS TWO DECADES ALREADY. SO THIS GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE POPULATIONS THAT COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM A LAW LIKE THIS AND AS. THE AS IT. ATTORNEY. ANGEL HAD MENTIONED WHILE IT MIGHT BE A MODEST NUMBER WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS IT WILL IN FACT VERY MEANINGFUL SO WITH THAT WE. HOPE THAT THE D. THAT A COMMITTEE HERE CONSIDERS THIS IN SUPPORT. OKAY OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT WAS A BEACON WITH A SO YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. TIFFANY IRAQIS ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE INSPIRED. GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU EARLY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OR CONDUCT. YEAH I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. IF ANYBODY CAN ANSWER TO WHAT LEVEL AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS WOULD VICTIMS. OF OF THE CRIMINAL OFFENSES BE ENGAGE WITH. WELL I CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THAT. FOR FIRST WILL WONDER MARCY'S LAW AS A VICTIM IS ENTITLED TO BE NOTIFIED WHENEVER THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE SENTENCE OR OR HEARING THAT COULD IMPACT THAT SENTENCE. AND CERTAINLY BY PRACTICE AND I SHOULD SAY PASSION AND CALLING THEM AYE I KNOW EVERY PHILLIP ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE GOT INTO THE WORK THAT WE DO. IN THE CASE OF MISTER GARCIA THAT I SPOKE ABOUT AND I IN OTHER CASES WE'VE WORKED UPON. WE WOULD NOTIFY. THE VICTIMS HAVE CERTAINLY REMEMBER FOR THIS IT'S A RE SENTENCING SO IF THE SENTENCE IS RECALL. IF THE JUDGE. ALL THIS HAS GONE FROM A JUDGE SO THEN LEGAL YOUR PLACES IF NEW SENTENCING AND YET HAPPENS THE CONVICTION STAYS IN PLACE. NOW YOU'RE THE TIME SENTENCING SO ALL THE SAME RIGHTS. THAT EVERYONE HAS INCLUDING THE VICTIM WOULD STAY IN PLACE THEY'D BEEN TITLE TO NOTICE AND TO HEARING. A BUT CERTAINLY BEFORE WE EVER DID IT ANYTHING WE WE'VE DONE WORKING CONVICTION INTEGRITY LIKE THIS WERE USUALLY WORKING WITH THE VICTIMS VERY EARLY ON TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD AND. AN HONOR. AND IF IT STAR ONE LAST THING I CAN SAY I'M ONE OF THE BREEZE ONCE I'VE WORKED ON. IT WAS A SERIES OF BURGLARIES FOR VERY LONG TIME AGO. OF ALL THE VICTIMS I CONTACTED YOU TO A PERSON THEY HAD SAID THAT THE SUPPORT OF THIS INDIVIDUALS RELEASE WITH ONE ELDERLY GENTLEMEN. WHAT IS GRANDDAUGHTER SAID THAT IT ACTUALLY WE'D VERY MUCH ON HIS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL STILL IN PRISON? A DECADES AFTER WHAT HE HAD VIEWED AS A CRIME THAT I DIDN'T DESERVE IT SO THAT DIDN'T DECIDE IF IT WAS SOMETHING. WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT AND IF YOU WE EXPRESSED. OKAY MISCARRY. THANK YOU UM LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS TO LIGHT THE? NATIONAL CASE. WHEN THE HIP HOP ARTIST NAME MAKE MALE WHO. HAS ALSO SPARKED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA COULD CERTAINLY SET A ROLE IN IN. ENSURING. THAT WE ARE THINKING. ABOUT NATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS US TO WHAT WE DO WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND HOW WE DON'T INCARCERATE OUR WAY OUT OF PROBLEMS ARE INTO MORE PROBLEMS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. I WILL BE VOTING YES ON THE SPELL AND AND SUPPORT AND I WOULD REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IMPROVING IT AND REALLY HELPING. HOW THOSE ARE WORKING TOWARDS PROMOTE JUSTICE REFORM? THANK YOU. IF YOU WISH CON LAGER. THEY TWO ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT. CASES LIKE MR GARCIA'S ARE NOT RARE IN DEED THEY ARE PROBABLY MORE COMMON THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT. BUT IF WE WERE TO ADMIT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE IMPLICIT BIAS THAT IS INHERENT IN MANY OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WANTED TO KNOW ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS. THAT I I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE I DIDN'T SEE THEM BUT IN TERMS OF. WILL THE I BELIEVE THE WAY THE RESTRICTIONS OF WORK AND IT'S REALLY. A. MERE ANSWER TO THE ONE I GAVE BEFORE SINCE LEGALLY THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THE TIME PRIOR TO SENTENCING. THERE ARE MANY RESTRICTIONS THAT EXIST. DEPENDING ON THE CHARGES SO IN OTHER WORDS SOME CHARGES CAN'T BE LEGALLY STRICT AND SOME CHARGES CAN'T BE. IT MUST BE RUN CONSECUTIVE OTHERS CAN BE RUN CONCURRENT SO ALL THE SAME RESTRICTIONS THAT EXISTING CURRENT LAW WOULD REMAIN. SO THAT PART OF THEY WOULD OUR MAIN HOWEVER THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON THE TYPE OF CASE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD RIP REQUEST FOR RECALL. NOW SOME WILL BE POINTLESS IF SOMEBODY HAS. MANDATORY LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCE YOU GO BACK TO SENTENCING WHAT'S GOING EXACT SAME SENTENCE ALL OVER AGAIN BUT OTHERS AS IN THE CASE OF MISTER DARCY AND OTHERS A SIMILAR TO HIM. YOU KNOW THERE OF THEIR BE A LOT MORE THERE'D BE ALL THE SAME FLEXIBILITY THAT CURRENTLY EXIST. IS THERE ANY REAL ARE THERE ANY I'M SORRY. ON FOR JUST JUST A POINTER ON PAGE ONE THE ANALYSIS. SPECIFIES* DO NOT APPLY TO ANY INMATES SERVING A. SENTENCE FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER OR FOR ANY CONVICTION HAVE REQUIRES REGISTRATION AS A SEX. SO THAT ARE I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE THE. YOU'RE AND THEN ARE THERE ANY IS THERE ANY RELIEF FOR DENIAL. WELL I I THINK IT'S AGAIN GO BACK TO IT SENTENCING SO SOMEBODY CAN ALWAYS. AYE IT WILL DEPENDING ON THE POTTERY TO REPEAL OR READ THE DECISION BY THE JUDGE IN THIS IS LIKE ANY OTHER JUDICIAL DECISION. AND I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT OF MORE BILLS LIKE THIS WERE ALSO LOOKING AT THE CONSISTENCY IN WHICH THESE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS DE A. WELL THROUGHOUT DE A OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND ALSO NOT JUST IMPLEMENTATION BUT TRAINING. IN TERMS OF HELPING DA'S. USE A DIFFERENT LANDS AS THEY LOOK AT THE CASES THAT COME BEFORE THAT GOT ME AGAIN THIS THIS LAW IT GIVES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES DISCRETION. SO REALLY IS. UP TO INDIVIDUAL OFFICES TO IMPLEMENT THIS AS THEY. AS THEY CHOOSE FED OUT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT NOT. ALL OFFICES OPERATE IN THE SAME WAY BUT OBVIOUSLY. WE HOPE THAT BY SOME OFFICES LEADING BY EXAMPLE OTHER OFFICES OR FALL. DID. KILEY. I'LL SO I'M PRIDE GENERALLY PRETTY FAVORABLE TOWARDS THIS. THIS IDEA I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I THAT I WAS A BIT OF CLARIFICATION ON AND. ONE IS THAT KIND OF THE UNIVERSE OF OF FOLKS THAT IT IT WOULD APPLY TO I THINK YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE A THOUSAND PEOPLE. EITHER INCARCERATED RIGHT NOW. THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WHO ARE NON VIOLENT IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S JUST ONE POPULATION AYE CITIZENS RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK WOULD PROBABLY RISE TO THE TOP OF THE PRIORITY LIST AND READ ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING LONG TERM SENTENCES. TWENTY YEARS OR MORE. FOR A LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT OFFENSE. BUT THAT DOESN'T BUT THERE'S A OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS SO AND AS IT WAS MENTIONED. THERE'S NO EXCLUSION FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR A TYPE OF CASE THAT COULD BE UNDER REVIEW BY IDEA. I SEE AND WE HAVE SOME DEBATES HERE ABOUT WHAT'S VIOLENT WHAT'S NONVIOLENT SO AYE I. WHAT TYPE OF TYPE OF OFFENSE THAT WE GENERALLY DON'T THERE WHEN IT'S A LONG ENOUGH SENTENCE FOR THE PERSON TO BENEFIT FROM THIS RELIEF? YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CRIMES OUT OF THE FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE. IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO THE ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING DOES ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVICTED FOR THEFT OFFENSES BOTHERS PETTY THEFT OR DRUG RELATED OFFENSES FRAUD AND FORGERY THOSE ARE THAT. THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY SMALL. AND SUBSET OF THE LARGER POPULATION BUT I RAISE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL THAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING. SOME LIFE TERM SENTENCES IN OUR PRISON FOR A LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT OFFENSES PETTY THEFTS I GUESS THIS VIDEO THAT WAS RIGHTS CASES MUST. HAVE WITH THE PRIOR A DRUG POSSESSION AND DRUG SALES YES I SEE. I'M IN AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL US TO THE DA MAKES THAT IT'S GOT AGREES TO PETITION THE COURT AND YOU KIND OF SAID IT'S BASICALLY LIKE THE SENTENCING HEARING ALL OVER AGAIN RIGHT. YET WILL I MEAN IN REMEMBER ALL OF THE SCHOOLS IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE THE DA COMMIT TO REQUEST THE JUDGE HAS TO. ACTUALLY DECIDE TO RECALL THE SENTENCE AND THEN YOU HAVE. YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A SENTENCING DATE NEW SENTENCING HEARING SO LEGALLY TO SORT IT TAKES BACK IN TIME. AS IF THE SENTENCING HADN'T HAPPENED BUT YOU DON'T EVEN GET THERE IF THE JUDGE DOESN'T AGREE TO RECALL THE SENTENCE AND WHAT'S THE STANDARD FOR THE JUDGE AGREEING TO RECALL IS THAT THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE OR. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I YOU KNOW I'M NOT POSITIVE I BELIEVE SO. ALRIGHT. YEAH I THINK I'M TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I HAVE I I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT AYE. SOME OF THE FOLKS THIS MIGHT APPLY TO AND I GUESS MY SECOND CONCERN WOULD BE. WHETHER D. AIDS ARE NECESSARILY. PEOPLE BASS POSITION TO. DO SOME OF THE ANALYSIS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL IS TO THE EXTENT OF REHABILITATION. AND THAT SORT OF THING SO I HOPE THAT THOSE CONCERNS WILL BE KEPT IN MIND THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND I THINK. THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO EXCLUDE SEX OFFENDERS AND FIRST REMARK READ THE BILL DOES SO. THANKS WRITTEN FOR. THANK YOU BYE DANIAR QUESTION. OUT YOU MAY CLOSE TO THE I THINK IT WAS A CHAIR I AGAIN. TO REITERATE THAT THERE IS THERE IS A SEPARATE PROCESS THROUGH THE. PAROLE BOARD AGAIN THIS ALLOWS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL. I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE. ABILITY IN THE. DISCRETION INVOLVED TO TO REALLY PARTICIPATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND REALLY APPRECIATE. WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVE OUT. OKAY CHAIRS REGULARLY I NEED OF AYE MEDIA. MOTION THE SECOND. RENT SCHECTER CULTURAL. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY ABOUT BOATING CDVA. CARILLO AYE CATALOGUER DEATH CATALOGUER DEATH AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. BILL PASSES. THANK YOU. AND. REMIND MEMBERS WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT. MORE BILLS BEFORE WE GET TO DEVOTE ONLY. SO LET'S. OTHERWISE WILL BE. WORKING PASSED. TWELVE. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AND. TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I AM BRINGING BACK A BILL THAT I FIRST INTRODUCED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH EXPANDS. AB TEN FOURTEEN OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER WHICH WAS. I CARRIED BY DAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SKINNER NOW SENATOR SKINNER. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER TO ASK FOR A GUN BONTA STRAINING ORDER FROM A COURT OF LAW. SIMILAR TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS I BELIEVE THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYERS COWORKERS I TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS PROFESSORS FACULTY MEMBERS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS. A NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS MASS SHOOTINGS HAPPENED IN WORKPLACES AS WELL AS AT SCHOOLS. OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU ARE AT COLLEGE YOU ARE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T ABLE TO ISN'T ABLE TO SEE EVERY PARTICULAR SITUATION. A WE HAD A SHOOTING AT A WORKPLACE AT THE UPS. CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN WHERE INDIVIDUAL WHEN ENDED AND HOW THE MASS SHOOTING WITH SOME OF HIS COWORKERS. SO WE BELIEVE THAT IN THIS SITUATION IT MAKES SENSE TO DO EXPANSION ON THE ONE ISSUE WITH THE BILL FROM LAST TIME WHICH WE REMEDIED. WAS ON. WE HAVE INCLUDED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WE HAVE NOW TAKEN THAT PART OF THE BILL OUT OF THE WHITE ITS ARE FAIRLY IDENTICAL TO WHAT WE PRESENTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT. SIR THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CALVIN QUICK. FROM BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS OR PASTA. FOR SHORT. WE REPRESENT SEVERAL HUNDRED ENGAGED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA AND WE ARE AN ENTIRELY STUDENT LED ORGANIZATION. CREATED IN THE WAKE OF THE UPHEAVAL OF STUDENT ACTIVISM THAT IS FOLLOWED THE TRAGIC SHOOTING IN MARJORIE AT THE MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN FLORIDA. SO. AS STUDENTS WE KNOW FIRST HAND THAT SOMETIMES THE INDIVIDUAL WHO KNOWS THE MOST ABOUT ONE PERSON'S STATE OF MIND. YOU CAN CONNECT WITH THEM BEST IS A TEACHER R. CO WORKERS SOMEONE WHO THEY SEE EVERYDAY WHO IS VERY PRESIDENT IN THEIR LIFE WHO. ISN'T MAYBE A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS AREN'T ALWAYS THERE. A IN A FAMILY. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE NICHOLAS CRUISED THE SHOOTER AT PARKLAND WAS KNOWN BY HIS FORMER TEACHERS. AS AN UNSTABLE TEENAGER A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND TO OTHERS. BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO COME FORWARD AND. ACT TO PREVENT THIS TERRIBLE TRAGIC SHOOTING. DOWN SO I STUDENTS WE ARE. REALLY AFRAID FOR OUR VERY LIVES WHEN WE GO TO SCHOOL AND WE LIVE IN WE GO TO SCHOOL AND WE KNOW THAT OUR TRUSTED TEACHERS THESE PEOPLE THAT WE TRUST. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT US TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES AND SO WE THEREFORE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. AMANDA WILCOXSON BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL COMPLIANCE RESTRAINING ORDER LAW. HALF AFTER SO MANY OF THESE HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS AS WELL AS THE DAILY. INCIDENTS OF GUN VIOLENCE WE OFTEN HEAR THAT THERE WERE THOSE AROUND THE PERSON WHO SAW WARNING SIGNS AND HAVE CONCERNS. BUT THEY HAD NO LEGAL TOOL TO DISARM. WHEN WE PASS THAT ORIGINAL LAW IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ARE THERE WAS OF COURSE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LAW BEING OVER USED. OR ABUSED. AND OUT OF THAT. THE LAWS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WE SEE THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE THERE'S ONLY BEEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY. I THINK GUN VIOLENCE WE OR. RESTRAINING ORDERS OBTAINED. MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE FINDING THAT FOR FAMILY MEMBERS IT IS A VERY BIG STEP. TO GO TO THE COURT AND AND. FILED A PETITION FOR GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IN FOR SO MANY. BY THE TIME THEY'RE ALL HAVE THAT MUCH CONCERN TO TAKE THAT STEP DURING A CRISIS SITUATION THEY'RE CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTEAD SO THAT'S HOW. HOW THE LAW IS PLAIN OUR AND CERTAINLY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE OVER USED OR ABUSED? HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY NOT BE RESPONSIVE TO A CONCERN AND THAT CONCERN MAY NOT BE FROM FAMILY MEMBERS BUT AS WAS STATED EARLIER. COULD BE. FROM SOMEONE FROM THE SCHOOL SETTING OR FROM THE WORK SETTING. AND RIGHT NOW OF COURSE THEY CANNOT PETITION THE COURT THE OTHER THING IS THAT SOME FAMILIES EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A CIVIL ORDER NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. SOME OUR COMMUNITIES ARE RELUCTANT TO GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INVOLVE THEM ANY KIND OF. FAMILY CRISIS OR SITUATION SO WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT. WILLING TO RESPOND OR IS NOT RESPONSIVE AND WHEN THE FAMILY. A CONCERN INDIVIDUALS NOT A FAMILY MEMBER IS RELUCTANT TO GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ODD THEN I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPTION TO HAVE AVAILABLE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE IS THE COMMITTEE. MENEM'S ARE A FAIRLY COMPETITIVE DIFFERENCE LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AMONG FULL THE TIME BUT ELECTED BASED. A QUICKLY SPEAK TO SOME THE LEGAL STANDARD THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE OPPONENTS ARGUMENTS IN THE BILL ANALYSIS. IS WHY CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER THE STRICT LEGAL STANDARD ON WHICH COURTS MUST EVALUATE WHETHER TO ISSUE INGENIERO. ALL OF THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY EXISTING STATUTE WOULD STILL APPLY. EXPORTING SHORT TERM VIEW BUREAUS ME ONLY BE ISSUED AN EMERGENCY CASES IF A JUDGE FINDS BASED ON TESTIMONY SUBMITTED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. REGARDING FACTS PERSONALLY KNOWN TO THE PETITIONER THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD THAT THE RESPONDENT POSES A SIGNIFICANT DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND THAT EXPORTED YOUR WAS NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. G. BUREAUS ISSUED AFTER NOTICING HEARING HAVE TO MEETING EVEN HIGHER BURDEN OF PROOF. ANYONE WHO FELT THE KNOWINGLY FALSE HARASSING PETITION SUBJECT TO FELONY PERJURY CHARGES AND FINALLY ON AT THE COLLEAGUES AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS CAN ALREADY ATTAINED EX PARTE FIREARM PROHIBITING PROTECTIVE ORDERS AGAINST INTERESTED IN A COLLEAGUE. I WAS SPECIFICALLY THREATEN THEM AS INDIVIDUALS THE DIFFERENCE HERE THE QUESTION WOULD THIS BILL IS WHETHER DOES SEEM INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE TRUSTED AND EMPOWERED TO PROACTIVELY SPEAK FOR SAFETY WHEN THEY HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF A PERSON. THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS WHERE THE PUBLIC AT LARGE I RESPECTFULLY URGE RIVAL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. HI TIFFANI PULLEYBLANK WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. A WHO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GET. I LISTEN BIGELOW THE ACLU CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT. WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO REMOVING GUNS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE AGGRESSIVE THEMSELVES OR OTHERS I PROVIDED THERE ARE NON DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA AND THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TO PROCESS. WE ALSO DID NOT OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TV ARE OF SYSTEM. I'M THAT WITH TEN FOURTEEN BECAUSE THAT WAS CRAFTED NARROWLY I'M SO THAT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PEOPLE WITH CLOSE. OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL ARE AUTHORIZED TO SIX TO SEEK EX PARTY AND ORDERS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORIZED TO SEEK EX PARTY ORDERS AND. AS THE AS WE HAVE HEARD IT SOMETIMES CO WORKERS. CAN'T HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP AND BUT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE WORKPLACE IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE WORKPLACE I'M IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE FOR FOR YOU KNOW CO WORKERS TO HAVE BARELY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PERSON. BEFORE SEEKING AN EX PARTE ORDER AND OF COURSE THESE ARE ORDERS WHERE. THE ORDER IS ISSUED WITHOUT THE PERSON EVEN HAVING KNOWLEDGE. KNOWLEDGE THAT THE ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED. AND SO THIS EXPANSION TO CO WORKERS TO EMPLOYERS TO. BOB AND TWO SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ON IS REALLY PRONE TO ABUSE AND. I APPRECIATE THE THE MOST THE MOST RECENT COMMENTS ABOUT AND JUDICIAL AND DETERMINATION THERE BUT. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CLIMATE THAT WERE AND I THINK WE CAN STILL. IMAGINES A PERSON HOLDING AN IRRATIONAL FEAR BIAS AGAINST A CO WORKER AYE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION BECAUSE OF THEIR NATION OF ORIGIN. ON AND AND THIS WOULD AUTHORIZED. AND SOMEONE WHO HARBORS THOSE FEARS AND WHO IS A CO WORKER AT THIS PERSON WHO DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO SEEK AN EX PARTY ORDER. AND AND THE. ONLY WAY THAT THAT ARE THE WAY THAT THAT PERSON WOULD FIND OUT THAT THIS HAS BEEN ISSUED IS COPS WOULD SHOW UP AT THEIR DOOR AND THE MIND DEMAND THAT THEY SURRENDER THEIR WEAPONS. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THEY AND HAVE NOT MAKE CRIMINAL THREATS. AND THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE ANY FIREARMS BUT IF AN OFFICER SHOWS UP AT THEIR HOUSE AND DEMANDING TO SEE FIREARMS DEMANDED THAT THEY SURRENDER THERE'S FIREARMS AND THEY MAY BE SUBJECTED TO A SEARCH OF THEY IF THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED THOSE. AND THEN FINALLY JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AN EX PARTE ORDER THE WHOLE RATIONALE AND EXPERTISE ORDER IS THE URGENCY OF THE ALLEGED THREAT. UNDER THIS BILL A SCHOOL EMPLOYEE WHO HAS HAD CONTACT WITH THE STUDENT AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS AUTHORIZED TO SEEK AN EX PARTE ORDER AND SO. THAT SEEMS IN CONTESTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE. WITH THE IDEA OF OF THE URGENCY OF AN EX PARTE ORDER. SO. AGAIN WORD NOT OPPOSED TO G. VERA'S. WHERE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORIZES SEEK THOSE I'M HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A PERSON THERE NUMBER THE FAMILY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT? ON BUT UNFORTUNATE THIS BILL WE FEEL WHATEVER JUST DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT AND WOULD NOT PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. MEASURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COULD LOSE ABOUT THE FARMS POLICY COALITION AND. MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE ACLU IS EXPRESSED A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS COUPLE PLACES WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE IS THAT WE DO HAVE ISSUES WITH NOT SO MUCH THE CONCEPT OF DVRS BUT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DUE PROCESS THAT OCCURS AFTER ONE'S RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY IS IN FACT NOT DUE PROCESS. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY ONE OF A MYRIAD OF EMPLOYEES SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. ANY ONE OF THEM COULD SEEK A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST ANY MEMBER OR STAFF MEMBER WORKING WITH IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WHETHER THEY KNOW THEM WHETHER THEY KNOW THEM OR NOT. AND WHILE I I WOULD THINK THAT ALSO CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY IN THESE CAN IN THIS IN THIS PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ABOUT CONCERNS RELATING TO THINGS LIKE IMPLICIT BIAS. PA OR UNFAIR. A POSITION SOMETIMES AND IT CONCERNS ABOUT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I WOULD THINK THAT ONE WOULD WOULD WOULD. RECOGNIZE THAT THIS CAN EXPAND BEYOND A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING ONE'S POSITION ON FIREARMS THE FINAL THING THAT I'D LIKE TO NOTE ABOUT THIS MEASURES THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT A NOTHING UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT WOULD PROHIBIT AN INDIVIDUAL FROM GOING DIRECTLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT I IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO. REQUEST OR NOTE THAT THIS MIGHT BE SOME THAT A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. A I THINK AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A LITTLE TO NO REAL DATA IN TERMS OF OF HOW MANY HAVE BEEN ISSUED HOW MANY HAVE BEEN. HOW MANY HAVE BEEN ISSUED UNDER? A UNDER GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AND HAVE BEEN ISSUED CORRECTLY AND HOW MANY HAVE BEEN ISSUED INCORRECTLY I THINK THAT THIS BILL. DOES NOTHING MORE OTHER POTENTIALLY VIOLATE THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF OF CALIFORNIA GUN OWNERS AND THEREFORE WE ASK THAT YOU WOULD OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THAT MANY FOR THE RECORD DAN REED WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO. GIVEN ME TOO FOR GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIANS HERE PA. A WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ACLU FPC. WERE OPPOSED TO EXPANSION ON THIS. HOWEVER WE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSING FURTHER OPTIONS. WITH. UTILIZING A PROCESS BUT DUE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE THEIR THIRD THE EX PARTE IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US AS THE REMOVAL OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WITHOUT NOTICE OR LITTLE TO NO HEARINGS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK. ANOTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KILEY. I THINK THAT THE CONCEPT OF GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS IS A GOOD ONE AND IS ACTUALLY A I PRETTY SENSIBLE. TARGETED WAY TO TRY TO. REDUCE THE THREAT OF GUN VIOLENCE I AM I WANT TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THIS IS. SET UP RIGHT NOW SO WE HEARD A COUPLE CONCERNS ABOUT AYE DUE PROCESS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE EX PARTE ORDER IS THAT THE TWENTY ONE DAY. PERIOD BEFORE THEN THE PERSON WHOSE. LOSES POSSESSION OF THEIR FIREARMS HAS THE CHANCE TO BE HEARD IS THAT RIGHT. YES WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO MOVING THAT UP SO THAT THE. THE HEARING OF THE POST DEPRIVATION HEARING AFTER SOONER LIKE IT. WILL AGAIN THESE ARE ALL ON. THE GUNS ARE TEMPORARILY REMOVED. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE A DUE PROCESS HEARING. MAYBE THAT'S PART OF A LONGER TERM REMOVAL I THINK THERE WERE ALL I'M OPEN TO A VARIETY OF DISCUSSIONS. I DO WANT TO RIP REFUTE. I THINK THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT REGARDING. PEOPLE WHO ARE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CLOSE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S RELATED TO A FAMILY MEMBER DOESN'T MEAN THAT NECESSARILY CLOSE. WE OFTENTIMES I PROBABLY SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING DIE EVEN DO MY FAMILY UNFORTUNATELY. SO THEY ACTUALLY GET TO SEE ME A LOT ARE THEN. MY OWN CHILDREN UNFORTUNATELY. SO AGAIN I WE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY SENSIBLE TOO AGAIN AND WE'VE CHOSEN A SMALL TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH INDIVIDUALS. OKAY THAT I SEE THAT POINT AND. I I PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THE POST DEPRAVATION IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE CAN BE X. PARTE. DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHTS UP LIKE TO SEE THAT. THE THE HEARING WHERE THEY CAN BE HEARD LIVE MUCH CLOSER TO THAT THAT THE DATE OF THE SEIZURE I THINK INSTANCE TAKES A TEMPORARY SITUATION. RIGHT BUT SO WHAT TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU CAN BE HEARD SEE IS THAT MAYBE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SEIZURE THEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND. AND AND THAT'S ON THE DETERMINATION IS MADE WHETHER TO EXTEND IT TO YEAR I'M SO ALSO ON THE POINT OF ON THEM IT DOES. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS HOUSING AND USE THAT MUCH SINCE THE INITIAL BELL RIGHT AND MOSTLY IT'S BEEN DONE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. OUT WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT INSTEAD OF GIVING NEW. CLASSES OF PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO PETITION THEMSELVES MAYBE WE CAN SET UP A BETTER SYSTEM FOR ALLOWING PEOPLE THAT I PROVIDE INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS DEAD PEOPLE THE BAY THEMSELVES MIGHT AND ONE OF PETITIONS FOR. WHAT WILL PEOPLE HAVE THAT ABILITY RIGHT NOW? RIGHT SO WELL I DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED NEW LOG TO DO THAT. I SEE SO GUY. I'M JUST I GUESS I'M WONDERING HOW OFTEN. YOU THINK SOMEONE'S GONNA THEMSELVES GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GOING TO COURT AND GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCEDURE FOR PETITIONING. I'M. MIGHT BE EASIER IF WE PROVIDED MORE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE ABOUT AS YOU SAY SOME AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO NOW WHICH IS TO. ALERT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE EXISTENCE OF A POTENTIAL THREAT. I AGAIN. YOU WE CAN'T CURRENTLY. LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS PROVISION I KNOW NEITHER OF THE TWO COUNTIES THAT I'VE. THAT I REPRESENT HAVE TO HAVE UTILIZED A PROVISION. STE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY JUST RECENTLY I ISSUE TEN GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. YOU KNOW GO THROUGH HER THROUGH HER OFFICE A WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. A AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SENSIBLE EXPANSION IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN PARK LAND AND YOU AT LAW ENFORCEMENT A COULD DOESN'T THINK IF THEY HAD A GBR O. BUILT THEY COULD DONE SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO. IF WE HAD SCHOOL OFFICIALS WITH THIS EXPANSION THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING AGAIN THIS IS ALLOWING ORDINARY PEOPLE TOOL AND IT'S JUST SIMPLY THAT A TOOL. TO AYE TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS TO GET. GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE WHO OBVIOUSLY. GIVEN WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE LAST COUPLE YEARS CAN CAUSE A GREAT AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I THINK YOU AND FINAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE THE CONCERNS BEEN REYES DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S BEEN HAPPENING SO FAR SINCE THERE BEEN SO FEW CASES BUT WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP TO SUCH A WIDE ACROSS THE PEOPLE. ARE THERE ANY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS FROM BEING ABUSED ACROSS OPAL. AGAIN NO WE ARE THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE AND. TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST KERRY'S ARGUMENT A TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I CARRY THIS LEGISLATION. WELL WE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE ARE COMING IF YOU THINK GOING THROUGH. A COM COURT PROCESS. IS NOT. IS EASY I MEAN I. I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT GOING TO COURT AS A PROCESS IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE. SO AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE ABUSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR GOODBYES RESTRAINING ORDERS HAVE PROVEN TO BE A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF WRONG PEOPLE. WE'VE SEEN UNFORTUNATE THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF MASS SHOOTINGS WHEN GUNS ARE IN THE HANDS OF RON PEOPLE. THIS JUST MERELY EXPANDS IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUND INDIVIDUALS TO MOST PEOPLE YOU GO TO SCHOOL WITH PEOPLE WHO TO WORK WITH. I BELIEVE IT'S A SENSIBLE EXPANSION RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT ON. GRAY IN A MINUTE AND. WHEN WE FIRST EGGMAN SHOOTING ALIKE COMMEND YOU ON. COMING UP WITH THE BILL TAKING GET BOTH THE NRA AND ACLU ON THE SAME PAGE. ON. WE HAVE ANY HEALTH APPROACH. SURE YOU KNOW THAT IS REMARKABLE. AND SO I AM ALSO IN THAT THEY MAKE SOME VALID POINTS ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT. THERE'S NO OVERREACH ORDERS IT'S NO PROBLEM IS DUE PROCESS. IN THAT SIR AND I AND I BELIEVE YOU'LL LOOK INTO THAT AS IT HOPEFULLY TIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. ON ENTERTAINS UP AND AYE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. MR MOTION. ON AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I COULD VIDEO. CARILLO AYE CATALOGUER DEATH. CAN BOTHERED ABOUT BOATING KILEY. KILEY NOT VOTING QUIRK. QUIRK NOT VOTING. SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THE MEASURE PASSES. TO CUNNINGHAM ITEM NUMBER ONE SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD CLOSE A SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE IN THE CURRENT SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY BY REQUIRING A TEAR TO. TWENTY YEAR REGISTRATION PERIOD. FOR AN ADULT WHO SOLICITS SOLICITS A MINOR VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THAT ADULT KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. THAT THE PERSON WAS BOTH. ONE A MINOR AND TO A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. UNDER CURRENT LAW THIS OFFENSE DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION. AND I JUST WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THE THE LIMITED NATURE OF THIS BILL WE WE HAVE AMENDED THE BILL IT ONLY APPLIES TO ADULT OFFENDERS NOT MINOR OFFENDERS. AND THE ADULTOFFENDER HAS TO SOLICIT SOMEONE WHO IS BOTH A MINOR. AND A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WHERE THAT IS KNOWN OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES? I'M. HERE WITH MISTER RYAN SHERMAN FROM THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION TO BRIEFLY TESTS FIND SUPPORT. MORNING MISS CHAIR AND SHERMAN THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OF WERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH SEEKS TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE CURRENTLY IN THE CALIFORNIA SEX ARSON REGISTRY THAT ALLOWS AN OFFENDER. TO AVOID REGISTRATION IF THAT OFFENDER KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE MINOR THEY WERE ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH. WAS WITH WHAT WAS A MAN OF VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SIMILAR TO THE STATUTORY RAPE LAWS. A SPECIFIC INTENT IS NOT A REQUIRED ELEMENT TO ATTACH STRICT LIABILITY FOR UP FOR CERTAIN CRIMES. AND SUCH LIKE SAID STATURE IRATE WAS ONE OF THOSE AND WE THINK THAT THIS WILL. HELP EFFORTS TO CRACKDOWN IN REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OR SEXUAL MUSA MINERS. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SEAN ON WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. JIM MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. LUCIA MUCH LARABEE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. NOT SETTLING WE HAVE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GLORY KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR ADVOCACY IN POLICY. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD IMPOSE RIGID REQUIREMENT FOR REGISTRATION FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR CONVICTED JON'S WHERE THE PERSON KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE PERSON WAS A MINOR AND A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THIS IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY AS A JUDGE COULD IMPOSE REGISTRATION UNDER EXISTING LAW BUT IT WILL RISK RESULT IN AN INCREASED BURDEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD HAVE TO PROCESS REGISTRATION PAPERWORK. AND TAKE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE FACT MONITORING OF THOSE REGISTERED OFFENDERS WHO POSE THE GREATEST RISK OF RE OFFENDING. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. I WOULD ECHO BASHIR'S COMMENTS BUT I WILL ALSO ASK YOU. TO CONSIDER FIRST ON. THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION SYSTEM WAS OVERHAULED LAST YEAR WITH SP THREE. EIGHTY FOUR AND THAT IS REALLY TOO EARLY TO US CHANGE START CHANGING THE RULES. ALSO I THERE'S NO RESEARCH SHOWING THAT. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE. BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION FOR SOLICITATION OR ATTEMPTED SOLICITATION. ARE AT RISK TO RE OFFEND SO IT'S TARGETING A GROUP. THAT HAS NOT BEEN FOUND BY ANY RESEARCH TO BE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE PUT ON THE STE KIND OF LIST IN FACT. THEY ARE IF THERE IS SOME PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THEN AS THIS YEAR SAID. THEY CAN'T THE JUDGE CAN. REQUIRE REGISTRATION BUT THERE'S NO RESEARCH SO. SHOWING THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THEM BAREST AND ARRESTED FOR PROSTITUTION IS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND. THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS A BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF PLACING SOMEONE. THE REGISTRATION EVEN IF. IT'S TIER TWO FOR TWENTY YEARS. YOU ARE ON PUTTING THE FAMILY IN THE POSITION OF BEING SHAMED AND SINGLED OUT THE COMMUNITY. YOU ARE IT ENDANGERS THEIR EMPLOYMENT WHICH THEN COULD LEAD TO THE. ECONOMIC MARGINALISATION OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY. IT. FOR CLOSES MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE. THAT ON THEM YOU NEVER EVER GET BACK. SO I DON'T THINK. AND I ASK YOU FOR YOUR NO BOAT RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES NOT POSITION. ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE WITH CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU I'D JUST. LIKE TO ADDRESS BRIEFLY A COUPLE THE ISSUES RAISED I ACTUALLY THINK THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TEARS THE SYSTEM NOW. IS. THE VERY REASON THIS BILLS. APPROPRIATE. AND MY CONCERN THE BILL IS THE CHAIR KNOWS LAST YEAR BUT I DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS. A PRUDENT BECAUSE OF THE LIFETIME REGISTRATION NATURE OF THE PRIOR SYSTEM BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE A TIERED SYSTEM I THINK. IT'S. A REASONABLE. MEASURE BECAUSE NOW TO TIER TWO NOT A LIFETIME REGISTRATION IT'S. WE WE'VE SORT OF OVER ALL THAT AND. WAS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MORE MANAGEABLE WAY I THINK THIS TYPE OF OFFENSES. A PERFECT CANDIDATE TO ADD TO THE TO THE TIER TWO I THINK NOW THAT WE GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY. WE CAN START LOOKING AT SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR LAWS THAT ARE MEANT TO. OF PROTECT FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND. AGAIN THIS BILL THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO PROSTITUTES THIS IS JOHN'S THIS THESE ARE PEOPLE SOLICITING. AND THE VICTIMS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY YOU FOR UNDER THIS BILL FOR REGISTRATION THE VICTIM. THE VICTIM HAS TO BE A MINOR. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE. GOING AFTER CHILDREN AND THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED. ESSENTIAL IN A FORM OF HUMAN SLAVERY AND AND. SO I WOULD WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I VOTE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU SEE CUNNINGHAM AND TAKE YOU FOR FOR WORKING ON THIS. FORTUNATE OF THE TEACHERS CAN RECOMMEND A NO VOTE. ON A CHUCKLE MISTER MOTION UC'S. ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY ICARLY YA. CARILLO NO CATALOGUER DEV.

CHAIRS DESIRE BY CAN TAKE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE TWO. FIRSTS. THOSE GUNS. A. TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT EIGHT. I'M SORRY. A. B. TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO. WHICH IS THE GHOST WHICH ONE IS. GO SCOTT WHAT WHATEVER ONE. ROB WHAT AWAY FOR ONE PERSON COMING IN BUT IT'S OKAY WILL MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO. WHICH SEEKS TO CLOSE THE GHOST GARDEN. LEUPOLD BY REQUIRING THE STATE. OF BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PURCHASING OF GOES UP SCUSE ME OF GUN PARTS AND ALSO CREATING NEW LICENSE STRUCTURE FOR GUNS. PARTS DEALERS GOES GUNS ARE VERY REAL ISSUE. IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH I REPRESENT IN THE COURT AS WELL AS ACROSS THE STATE. NOT TOO LONG AGO THERE WAS A SHOOTING. IN. MODES ARE SECOND. MISTER QUIRK SECOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WARY EYE MAN MURDERED FIVE PEOPLE INCLUDING HIS WIFE AND. WITH THEY GOES GOD THERE WAS A MAN THAT WAS PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING A FIRE ARM SO HE TOOK TO THE INTERNET TO BUY GUN PARTS HIMSELF AND BUILD HIS OWN GUN. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN SANTA MONICA TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WAY MEN ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE A FIREARM BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUND HIM IN ELIGIBLE. HE THEN RESORTED TO BUILDING HIS OWN GUN. WHICH THEN HE USED TO KILL FIVE PEOPLE INJURING SEVERAL OTHERS. THESE GUNS. COULD NOT EASILY BE PUT EXCUSE ME COULD EASILY BE PREVENTED IF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO WAS ALREADY IN ACTIVE BECAUSE. THE SHOOTER WOULD NOT BE. ALLOW TO PURCHASE AND NOR WOULD THAT PERSON. PASS A BACKGROUND. CHECK CURRENT LAW REQUIRES BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR BOTH GUN SALES AND AMMUNITION YET IT IS SILENCE ON THE OUR TREATMENT OF FIRE PRECURSOR THIS BILL INTENDS TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING. CREW BY PREVENTING CRIMINALS AND THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT OTHERWISE POSSESS THE FAR ARM FROM GAINING ACCESS WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF GUN OWNERS WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY. IS MISS AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN AND ALSO WILL HAVE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE BODY MAY HAVE. AGAIN AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE I WILL BE BRIEF AS APPEARS THERE IS SUPPORT. THE BRADY CAMPAIGN SCORE POLICY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A BACKGROUND CHECK ON EVERYONE WHO HAS A FIREMAN ALSO THAT YOU JAY HAS A RECORD OF THAT GUN IN CASE THE PERSON BECOMES PROHIBITED OR IF THE GUNS USED IN CRIME IT CAN BE TRACED. AND FORTUNE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A VERY VERY ALARMING AND ESCALATING PROBLEM WITH. GOES GUNS GUNS THAT ARE ASSEMBLED FROM PARTS INCLUDING UNFINISHED RECEIVERS THAT DO NOT HAVE A SERIAL NUMBER. AND. R. APPEARS COMMONLY USED IN CRIME APART AVOID OUR GUN LAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU'VE HEARD OF SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OF THIS MENTIONED. WE TRIED IT AND THIS IS BUT I ISSUE WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH IN CALIFORNIA. A BILL PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER THAT GOVERNOR SIGNED WOULD REQUIRE THOSE WHO ASSEMBLE MANUFACTURE GUNS TO. GET A SERIAL NUMBER HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK AND DOJ WOULD HAVE A RECORD. THAT'S DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE BECAUSE THAT. RELIES ON THE THE PERSON MAKING THE GUN TO TAKE ACTION AND I THINK A BETTER FAR BETTER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS TO REQUIRE. SELLERS OF THESE PARTS TO FOLLOW CERTAIN PROCEDURES INCLUDING A BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE SCHEME THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE BILL IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT MY UNDERSTANDING GOING VERY WELL. WITHIN HIM A BACKGROUND CHECKS SCHEME THAT WE HAVE WHERE THERE'S THE INSTANT CHECK AND A RECORD. THAT IS MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO I I THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS PROBLEM AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. NADER WITNESSES OR. ANY OF. HOUSING QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. LOUIS MO WITH SHIRE AGUIAR-CURRY HAVE OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED WE'VE SUFFERED THE IMPACTS OF THESE GHOSTS GUNS AND THEREFORE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THINK YOU. MAKE YOU. IRATE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THINK WE NEED TO MAKE WAY THE CHAIRMAN OF IT. MEMBERS SEPARATIST REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA. AND PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO HAS. BEEN A MANUFACTURER OF FIREARMS. FOR YEARS SO I'M I'M MADE RIFLES MANUFACTURED. AND SO I HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL EXPERTISE THIS BILL IS CALLING FOR. FIRST OF ALL IT'S INVENTING TERMINOLOGY IN IN IN THE FORM OF. PRECURSOR PARTS AND AND ALL OF THIS. THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MANY OF THESE PARTS. ARE NOT ONLY USED IN. MODERN SPORTING RIFLES OR WHAT. THE STATE LEGISLATURE LIKES TO CALL ASSAULT WEAPONS THERE USED IN GUNS THAT ARE NOT SEMIAUTOMATIC THEY'RE NOT. THERE IN VARIOUS CALIBERS DID VARIOUS KINDS THEY ARE GENERIC PARTS INCLUDING TRIGGERED GROUPS. MAGAZINE RELEASES BOLTS STOPS BOLTS. BOB VERSION LOWERS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHEN IT'S NOT A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN SO WE'RE CALLING TO. REGISTER AND DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON GUNS THAT THAT. I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS THAT THE SUBJECT OF ANY SORT OF LEGISLATION. THAT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THAT THE COMMENT EARLIER THAT THE. PROCESS FOR REGISTERING AMMUNITION PURCHASES IS GOING ALONG REALLY WELL I FIND THAT. KIND OF AN AMAZING STATEMENT SINCE I IT HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN NO REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN. IN ORDER FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS THE STATE IS GOING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF. REGISTERING AND DOING THE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR AMMUNITION PURCHASES THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS YOU WOULD BE REQUIRED SIR TO HAVE. STORES IN THE COMPANIES THAT SELL BLOCKS OF PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM. WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED UNDER THIS BILL AS A PRECURSOR PART. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE SHAPES. THAT. THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD NORMALLY THINK ABOUT HAVING A PRE MANUFACTURER PARTIALLY MANUFACTURE PART HE COULD BE A BLOCK OF ALUMINUM. OR A BLOCK OF PLASTIC AND IT CAN BE. MADE INTO A FIREARM. THE ABILITY FOR PRIVATE PEOPLE TO MAKE PRIVATE FIREARMS HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE UNITED STATES BECAME A COUNTRY IT IS A RIGHT THAT IS OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO. ALL CITIZENS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT IS. UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IT HAS BEEN HERE THE VERY FEW CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP WARY. GHOST GUN HAS BEEN USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME AND THE FACT THAT. A VERY SMALL POSITION UP. PERCENTAGE OF ALL CRIMES ARE COMMITTED WITH LONG GUNS. WOULD. INDICATE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT REALLY NECESSARY IN IS NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. IF THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED THESE CRIMES ARE ABLE TO TO BILL GUNS FROM GOES GUNS THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET GUNS FROM. ALL KINDS OF OTHER THE GONNA STEAL THEM THEY'RE GONNA BRING IN FROM OTHER STATES ARE GOING TO. IT IS IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THIS IS NOT GOING TO PREVENT ONE SINGLE DEATH FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE. IN STRONG OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD THE AND WE WOULD NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THIS BILLS INCREDIBLY OVERBROAD AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED. I KNOW THE INTENT OF THIS IS TO. FURTHER THAT THE SO CALLED GHOST GUN LAW OR THE UNFINISHED FRAMES AND RECEIVERS. BUT THAT WAS NOT EVEN BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL. GOING THROUGH THE REGULATIONS WERE SO GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EVEN SEEING HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ENFORCED. AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE I ARE NOT FIREARMS THE PRECURSOR PARTS THEIR THEIR CONSUMABLES THERE'RE THERE'RE. ITEMS ON FIREARMS DAY NEED REPLACING THAT ARE OFTEN UPGRADE IT. AND THEY'RE NOT FIREARMS THEY'RE NOT TREATED LIKE FIREARMS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY'RE NOT TREATED AS FIREARMS. BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS A FRAME THAT'S WOOD FRAMES ARE TREATED AS FARMS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE INTERTWINED REALIZE IT PARTS ARE IN RECALL BUT AGAIN THERE A CAN THESE ARE PARTS OR CONSUMABLES THAT. THAT BREAK THAT NEED REPLACING AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THIS WHICH IS CREATING ENFORCEMENT NINE. RIGHT I MEAN HOW DO YOU IN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BARRELS TRIGGER GROUPS. MAGAZINES EXETER AT THESE ARE THESE ARE PARTS THAT IN SOME CASES ARE. PUT ON ATTACHED WILL FIRE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE EVER COMPLIED WITH. WITH THIS LAW THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE AMMUNITION BACKGROUND CHECK IS MY COLLEAGUES STATED HERE. HOWEVER THAT'S NOT BEEN. BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IT HAS. IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT ACTUALLY PLAYS OUT AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO SEE REGULATIONS ON HOW THAT ACTS. THAT BACKGROUND CHECK WILL. WILL WORK IN REAL LIFE FOR THIS IN A HOST OF OTHER REASONS THAT WE STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION THIS BILL THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTEE CRAIG DELUDE ABOUT FOR THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES. IN AND PRIMARILY THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE REGULATORY SCHEME IS BASED ON A SCHEME THAT THEY'RE QUITE FRANKLY HAS NOT YET HAS YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I KNOW THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO TRY AND MAKE IT HAPPEN BUT THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY HANDED. A SOLID PIECE OF LEGISLATION FACT IS THEY WERE THEY WERE HANDED A PILE OF CHICKEN MANURE AND TOLD TO MAKE CHICKEN SALAD AND THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THAT THEY CAN BUT SO FAR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND UNTIL WE KNOW THAT WE OUGHT NOT BE BASING FURTHER A REGULATORY SCHEMES ARE ON ON THAT SAME SCHEME SO WITH THAT WE.

UNFORTUNATE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE WE WE HAVE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BUT WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED. TO TRY TO KEEP THIS SHORT IT DOES ALLOW BROADER ACCESS TO A PERSON'S RAP SHEET. INCLUDING THEIR ARREST RECORDS VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER COULD BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIOR ARRESTS FOR WHICH THEY'VE NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OR BECAUSE OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS THAT ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED. TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF BEING A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN OUR STATE PRISONS ARE NOT RECEIVED TRAINING AS FIREFIGHTERS THEY RISK THEIR LIVES THEY FIGHT FIRES ON THE FRONT LINES. I'M WHILE THEY'RE SERVING THEIR SENTENCE AND SO THERE IS NO LOGIC IN A POLICY THAT WOULD AND THE USE INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO FIGHT FIRES AND THEN ALLOWED TO. ALLOW THAT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM ON THAT WHEN THEY ARE APPLYING TO BE COME VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AFTER THEY LEAVE INCARCERATION. I'M SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS HARMFUL AND STIGMATIZING TO. PREVENT. FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO ARE FULLY TRAINED I'M FROM ENGAGING. MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES AND FOR WHICH THERE FULLY QUALIFIED SO AND WE DO THINK THAT AB TWENTY NIN IS. DISCRIMINATING AND WILL INCREASE UNFAIR BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY FOR FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY IN. I DID ASK FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS NON.

THE THE THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO GO AFTER. ANYONE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE A RAP SHEET OR HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED. QUITE FRANKLY WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME FORWARD ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH TRAINING AND. HAVE IT DONE THE FIREFIGHTER PROGRAM. THIS IS VERY SIMPLY A. PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURE TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC ON WHAT'S GOING ON AND ALLOW THOSE SH CHIEFS THE ABILITY TO KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY ON THEIR FORCE. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. YOU ODD THE CHAIRS REGULATE AYE MAINLY BECAUSE I DO KNOW WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. MORE TRAINING. PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED A FIREFIGHTER TAKE NEEDS AND GETTING THEM READY AND THEN THEY GET OUT. AN ACID TRIP PLY FOR FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS STATUS AND DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH. AND AND BECAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS RAP SHEET WE DO NEED TO. TO TO COME UP WITH A METHODOLOGY IN WHICH WE GO THROUGH THEIR BACKGROUNDS THEY COME OUT OF OUR ACADEMIES ARE AND I'M JUST MAKING THIS UP AS I GO ALONG. WHO MAKE UP OUR OWN? FIRE ACADEMY FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WILL WE. KIND OF. GO THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO TO ALL THE TRAIN BUT MORE IMPORTANT MAKE SURE. THAT THEIR BACKGROUNDS DON'T IMPACT AS THEY BECOME EMPLOYEES I DO BELIEVE FIREFIGHTERS AND. AND AND POLICE OFFICERS NEED WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SCREENING. AND SO THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY HIRE THEM THEY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE THE REAL PROBLEM IS. DATE WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE MORE OBLIGED TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. AND GET THAT STIGMA OFFER THEM THAT THEY WERE ARKAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM AND THAT'S A THAT'S A LARGER ISSUES FOR THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AYE VOTE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WE SHOT MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND WE BELIEVE THAT AND SOME AGENCIES IT MAY RD INCLUDE THIS THAT AS PART OF THEIR EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE PROCESS. AND. STATS WILL WE OBJECTED ISSUE CRIME IN BEING ADDED TO STATUTE IT'S OUT CODIFICATION WILL UNNECESSARILY AT TIME COSTS AND COMPLICATION WITHOUT COMMENSURATE BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND A WHILE WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS DESIRE TO PROVIDE MORE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR PEACE OFFICERS FACING TO SUPPORT ANY ACTION. ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE ROUTINELY. WE ARE ROUTINELY CRITICIZED FOR NOT ADDRESSING CLAIMS OF EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT. IN A MANNER BENNETT BENNETT BEFITTING THEIR SERIOUS NATURE. AND AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMPLICATES THE EXISTING EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE PROCESS A POTENTIALLY MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS AS APPROPRIATE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAMBERS JOHN OF THE VELVET CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT ANY BETTER THAN MY COLLEAGUE AND STATE SHERIFF'S ALSO POST. THANK YOU. MARGOT GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION I FIND MYSELF OF. IT COMES FROM WITH ODD FELLOW WITNESSES SPENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD JUST SECOND WHAT THEY HAVE SAID BUT ALSO BAD THERE'S A PUBLIC PERCEPTION. THAT THIS MIGHT BE UNTIMELY AND INSENSITIVE TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW. BAT BY A WELCOME THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I THINK ABOUT IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO SAY EDUCATION IN ADDITION TO IT DISCIPLINE IF DISCIPLINE IS WARRANTED. THAT THIS. THIS IS JUST. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON OUTSIDE OF THESE CORRIDORS AND WOULD ASK YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT VOTE NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES. OPPOSITION. AND QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I'M I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW THE BREVITY OF OF MOVING FAST. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT AND HAS NEVER BEEN. TO BE USED IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING ANY CASES OF POLICE VIOLENCE. THERE WILL NEVER BE A CORRECT MOMENT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES ESPECIALLY. AS WE LIVE IN A TIME IN WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA SHARE SO STORIES FROM THE PUBLIC DIRECTLY. I THINK IF WE ARE TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE BEING. SEEN ACROSS OUR NATION RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO VERY RECENTLY. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE HELP OFFICERS VERY VERY EARLY ON. THIS IS A THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT ONE COMMUNITY SAYS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED THAT THEY HAVE THE EDUCATION AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. EARLY ON SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ESCALATION THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IN THIS MOMENT. AND SO I HOPE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS ALSO FEAR AWAY FOR OFFICERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STRESSES AND ISSUES THAT THEY FACE ON THE JOB. WE KNOW THAT. THERE ARE HIGH LEVELS OF DIVORCE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S HIGH LEVELS OF PTSD WE KNOW THERE ARE HIGH LEVELS OF. OF ALCOHOLISM AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE AGENCIES HAVE THE AUTONOMY IN AUTHORITY TO SAY NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO DISCIPLINE BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE RESOURCE IN EDUCATION BASED TRAINING. THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY. RECEIVE THE EDUCATION THAT YOU NEED TO BECOME A BETTER OFFICER NO ONE GOES INTO THIS FIELD. WANTING TO DO HARM. YOU GO INTO THIS FIELD TRYING TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE COMMUNITY. AND WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS HAVE THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED IN THE COMMUNITY FEEL SAFE. WHERE THESE OFFICERS ARE PATROLLING? SO AT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DO THAT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THERE IN IOWA THANK YOU ON THE WE WORKED LONG AND HARD OVER THE WEEKEND. ON. BUT THE WORDING OF THIS AND AND. AND I WILL TELL YOU OF THE EIGHT AUTHORED VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE THAT. ON THIS BILL. WOULD NOT SUPPLANT IF SOMEONE RAPED SOMEONE IF SOMEONE KILLED SOMEONE. SOMEONE BEAT SOMEONE. THERE IS NO TRAINING FOR THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A CRIME IS LOW TRAINING THAT IS OFF TO TABLE. THIS IS ABOUT ON WORKING WITH OFFICERS SO THEY DON'T ESCALATE TO THAT LEVEL WORKMEN OFFICERS SO THAT WE CAN. TRAIN THEM ON. THINGS THAT. THEY CAN REVERSE. BOB ON A DAILY BASIS SUB PART OF DISCUSSION WE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE WITH THE PROPONENTS OF WITH BODY CAMERAS FOR EXAMPLE. OF AS YOU SEE AN OFFICER OUT THERE NEW TRAINEE IN THEIR SUPERVISORS WATCHING THAT OVER THE CAN USE THAT. THAT THAT THAT CAMERA TO SAVE YOUR POSTURE THE WAY YOU LOOKED AWAY YOU YOU'RE APPROACHING SOMEONE. THIS IS WHY IT ESCALATED INTO CONFRONTATION AND STARTED TEACHING. HOW THAT THEY CAN BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY WHILE MOST IMPORTANT THEY MAY NOT SEE THEMSELVES? AS THEY'RE TALKING TO SOMEONE AND I AND I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE BEING TIRED THEY JUST HOLDING. HAD TO HANDLE THE GOT INTO TALKING TO A YOUNG AFRICAN BOY IN HIS MIND IS BACK IS HURTING FROM THAT HEAVY BELT AND HE'S TIRED. FROM UP UP AND AFTER AMERICAN YOUNG MALE THAT IS SOMEONE ABOUT TO SHOOT ME. AND TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT AND TRAIN THEM NOT TO FIRE THEM. A TRAIN NETWORK WERE ABSOLUTELY NOT TRY TO. TO TO. HAVE JUST SUPPLANT. IF SOMEONE IS. BRUTALLY BEATEN SOMEONE OR KILLS SOMEONE SAY JUSTIN RETRAIN THAT IS NOT THE MESSAGE. AT THE AUTHOR BIO BORDERS WAS SUPPORTERS ARE TRYING TO PUT OUT THERE INSTRUCTORS SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING FROM SHALL THE MAY. I YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY TIMES WE WERE WORD SMITHING THIS. A IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN WORDSMITH THAT SO THIS DOES NOT SUPPLANT. GREGIS ACTIONS OF I'M SURE THE AUTHOR WILL BE WILLING TO TILT TO LISTEN AND IS SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN EITHER. SO THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED I'VE.

WORKING WITH ME TO BETTER REFINE THIS BILL. NOW THE PROP SIXTY FOURS LICENSING SYSTEM IS IN EFFECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. ARE SURE TO INCREASE. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH THE GUIDANCE. WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER CANNABIS DISTRIBUTOR DELIVERY DRIVER. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES AND OFFICER TO WRITE A CITATION OF A DISTRIBUTOR DOES NOT HAVE PHYSICAL MANIFEST WITH THEM. OR IF THEY FAILED TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO TRACK AND TRACE. THE BILL AUTHOR ALSO AUTHORIZES A CITATION OF THE LICENSE DOES NOT HAVE THEIR DELIVERY REQUEST. UNDER CURRENT LAW LICENSEES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THESE ITEMS WHEN TRANSPORTING CANNABIS. IT HEARING TO THESE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN ILLEGAL OPERATOR AND THOSE BREAKING THE LAW. WE WANT OFFICERS TO BE CHECKING FOR THESE ITEMS SO THEY CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. A LICENSE. AND A LIST ACTOR WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE LICENSEES KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENTS. EXCUSE ME THAT'S WHY.

LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT OUTLINING VARIOUS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ALONG WITH THEIR INTENDED GOALS AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE. HOW THE STATE PROVIDES IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS? THIS BILL IN BODIES TO OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ITS MOST RECENT REPORT THE CALIFORNIA REAL THAT REHABILITATION OVERSIGHT BOARD STATED.

MEMBERS WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO ENSURE STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICACIOUS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ONLY FRUSTRATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE PROGRAMS OUTCOMES. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THIS REPORT IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO INACCURATE INFORMATION. AND DESPITE THE LA O. AND AUTHORS ASSURANCES ADDING THE WORD FIGHT VALITY TO THE BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT RESULT IN. OUR CONCERNS BEING RESOLVED. WITH EVERY PRISON FACILITY OPERATING DIFFERENTLY DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE PRIORITIES AND UNIQUE SITUATIONS SUCH AS PROTESTS AND RIOTS. THIS REPORT WILL NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH THE RELEVANT INFORMATION YOU ACTUALLY NEED. KNOWING THE CHALLENGES WITH PROGRAMS AT EACH INDIVIDUAL FACILITY. INSTEAD. A PROGRAM WILL LOOK LIKE A FAILURE SIMPLY BECAUSE DATA SUGGESTS INMATE ACTS TOOK LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE THEIR COURSEWORK. NEVER MIND THAT INMATE AXE WAS HOSPITALIZED FROM A PRISON RIOT GUN SIDEWAYS. OR. OTHER INTEREST. INSTITUTION PROBLEMS. MEMBERS BILL IS NOT ONLY ANNETTE. IT'S POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE.

WHAT ASK YOUR SUPPORT? AND. AND I'VE TALKED OPPOSITION OF TALK TO YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED TO MY AUDITOR'S AND EVERYTHING. AND SO I THINK TO SPECIFIC POINT IS MAKING SURE. THAT WE GET GOOD INFORMATION QUALITY INFORMATION GOING AND SO WE CAN MAKE OUT OF A VALID. JUDGEMENT ON ON THESE PROGRAMS OF AN INCIDENT NICER BUT SOMETHING THAT MAY HAPPEN. WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP TO ME WHERE OUT YOU HAVE A A A A CLASS. A CARPENTER CLASS OR OR UNDERWATER WELDING CLASS. AND BECAUSE OF THEM VALUES ARE USED TO COLLOQUIAL THE SHOCK COLLAR DECIDES HE DIDN'T WANT. OF PEOPLE TO SHOW UP FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. IT MAY LOOK LIKE. A PROGRAM TO FAILURE BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T COMPLETE THE COURSES. BUT THAT WAS A RESULT OF SOMETHING INTERNAL. WITHIN THE SYSTEM WHICH IS A DIFFERENT CULTURE. THEN OUTSIDE OUR SYSTEM AND TO BE SURE THAT WE EVALUATED BASED ON WHAT ACTUALLY GOES ON. IMPRISON. ACTUALLY WE GET ACCURATE INFORMATION LIKE AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT. PEOPLE WHO WORK WITHIN THE FACILITY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT WORKING WITH THE PRISON WARDEN. TO EVALUATE IT SO THAT YOU YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THAT WE. WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT HAPPENING. OF MIGHT HAVE A JOB A A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THAT. ON THE OF THAT PROGRAM AS I SAID TO ONE OF MY MEMBERS I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT. ROCK CLIMBING HELPS REHABILITATE PEOPLE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT. NO LIKE TO HAVE IT EXAMINED OBJECTIVELY WITHOUT ANY PRE BIAS OR WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK THAT'S IF YOU CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK INSIDE I THINK YOU'LL GET BETTER RESULTS. BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT WILL WILL GET TO A POINT WHERE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY WORK WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT TO GET. THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED ALLY. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU. ON A. B. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. ITEMS ARE AYE LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE CARILLO. CATALOGUER DEATH. CAN MODERATE OF NOT VOTING. KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK NOT VOTING. SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THAT MEASURE PASSES. ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN ELEVEN. I DON'T OF THE FIVE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN ELEVEN AND VOTE BY THE WAY. AB NINETEEN ELEVEN CALLS ON THE COUNTIES. BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE TO TAKE FORMS ALREADY MANDATED BY EXISTING LAW FOR CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AND MAKE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC VERSION. THAT CAN BE TRANSMITTED INSTANTLY INTO THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES. THIS WILL ENSURE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES. I COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES ARE COMMUNICATION WHEN INVESTIGATING THESE CLAIMS. THIS BILL COMES FROM THE DEVASTATING STORY. OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD. GABRIEL FERNANDES A PALM DEL WHO WAS BRUTALLY BEATEN. AND TORTURED. BY HIS MOTHER AND BOYFRIEND. SEVERAL DIFFERENT CALLS WERE MADE TO BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. AND SOMEHOW GABRIEL STILL FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS. THIS UNFORTUNATE HAPPENSTANCE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON TODAY. AND ESPECIALLY MOST DISADVANTAGED REGIONS WITH MANY CHILDREN MOVING IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM. FOLLOWING THIS CASE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AUTHORIZED A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. TO RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS FOR HANDLING THESE CASES. FROM THAT COMMISSION CAN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ONLINE DATABASE REFERRED TO AS EAST CARS. WHICH MAKES THE CURRENTLY MANDATED FORM THAT MUST BE FILLED OUT UPON INTAKE OF AN ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE ELECTRONIC. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH FOLKS IN LOS ANGELES. WORKING ON THAT EACH CAR SYSTEM. AND THEY COULD NOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SHARING. AND HOW IT IS TRANSFORMED. THE WAY AGENCIES COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN DEALING WITH THESE CASES OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS DATABASE IS NOT AND I EMPHASIZE IS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASE. THIS IS NOT SIMILAR TO CAL GAINES. THIS IS A DEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES DATABASE THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC. THAT IS WHERE ONLY SPECIFIC IDENTIFIED BUT PEOPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE ACCESS TO. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THELACK OF NOTIFICATION THAT WOULD GO. TO THE PARENTS OF SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. BUT IT AS A DISTRO WITHIN INVESTIGATION. ALERTING SUSPECTS UNDOUBTEDLY ALTERS DETERMINING TRUTH. MUCH OF THE CONCERNS ARE COMING FROM THE SIDE. OF THOSE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN INSTANCES WHEN ALLEGATIONS ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THE DUE PROCESS FOR REMOVAL OF THE ALLEGATION. WHEN WE FOCUS SOLELY ON THAT ASPECT WE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THE HELP THESE CHILDREN. WHO ARE BEING ABUSED? THEY'RE ALREADY SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE IS THIS MANDATED PAPER FORM HAS BEEN STATUTE FOR MANY YEARS. THIS BILL UPDATES THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION MORE QUICKLY MORE EFFICIENTLY. BY USING TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY. AND. I. I HAD SOMEONE HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME TODAY WITHOUT A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. AND SO. THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO TESTIFY AND SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. UNDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN. POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE AB NINETEEN ELEVEN. I WANT TO START BY KNOWLEDGE AND THE TRAGEDY OF THE DEATHS OF GABRIEL FERNANDEZ THIS WAS OF COURSE A TRAGIC EVENT AND AND WE WANT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT THE. THE STATE CAN BETTER PROTECT ITS CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ELEVEN WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED GABRIEL STAFF WHICH HAPPENED AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED TO BE UNFOUNDED. AND HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE THEY ALREADY HAD AN ONLINE DATABASE SUCH SUCH AS WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL. AB NINETEEN ELEVEN PROPOSES CHANGES THAT WOULD PUT ALL CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF HAVING CHILD ABUSE OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM ENTERED INTO A DATABASE. WITH LITTLE OR NO OVERSIGHT AS TO HOW THE INFORMATION CAN BE ACCESSED WERE USED AND WITH UNDEFINED EXCUSE ME UNDEFINED STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE REMOVAL OF INFORMATION WHEN IT IS FOUND TO BE UNSUBSTANTIATED. THE CREATION OF AN A GOVERNMENT DATABASE TO COLLECT UNTESTED ACCUSATIONS OF IT IS TO BE DONE AT ALL. REQUIRES THE UTMOST CARE IN SETTING STANDARDS AS TO HOW THE INFORMATION COMES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DATABASE. HOW THE INFORMATION MAY BE USED? WHEN IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE RETAINED AND WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE FOR CHALLENGING THE INCLUSION OF THE INFORMATION. WE'VE SEEN THE TYPES OF ABUSES THAT THAT OCCUR WHEN SUCH STANDARDS ARE NOT EXPRESSLY LAID OUT WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE STATEWIDE CHILD ABUSE CENTRAL INDEX WHICH FOR MANY YEARS INCLUDED THE NAMES. OF MANY WRONGFULLY ACCUSED PEOPLE AND GAVE THEM NO WAY TO GET THEIR NAMES OFF THE LIST. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH CAL GANG WHICH ALSO KEPT INFORMATION ON PERSONS WHO DID NOT BELONG IN THE SYSTEM. AND WHICH ALLOW THE INFORMATION TO BE USED IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT AUTHORIZED. YET AB NINETEEN ELEVEN REQUIRES EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SET UP SUCH A DATABASE. AND FOR THE MOST PART LETS THEM SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS AT FOR HOW THEY WILL OPERATE. THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE INDEED THE LIKELIHOOD OF WIDESPREAD ABUSE IS CLEAR. WE ASK YOU TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BY VOTING NO ON THIS. THANK YOU HER INDIA. MISTER TREMORS ON I'M HERE IN THE CONCERNS POSITION JOIN OF OR SOME GAP THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS. ASSOCIATION WE HAVE BEEN HAD MEETINGS WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF THE SPONSORS OF THE BELL. MOM AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE SITUATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH WHICH IF WE HOPE DOESN'T HAPPEN OTHER KINDS THAT WE KNOW DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES. BUT OUR ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS COSTLY INEFFECTIVE IT WOULD ASK EACH COUNTY TO CREATE A BRAND NEW DATABASE YOU ALREADY HAVE EXISTING DATABASES FOR ALL ORDER ACQUIRED ACROSS REPORTING. AND SO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE OF THE WORD OR YOU DO AND VERY COSTLY SO WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE AUTHORS OFFICE OF WE COULD DO IT USE OUR EXISTING DATABASES COMPLY WITH A BELL. SOBRE STONE CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT. AND IS ALSO SICK OF IT MANDATE ON COUNTIES ON AND EIGHT EACH COUNTY IS DIFFERENT ON RESOURCES AND SO WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO. MENTION THOSE THINGS ON TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS THANK YOU. AND GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY RYAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO BROKEN REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO WITH THE CONCERNS POSITION OF FOR ALL THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE SLACKER. THURMOND VERY FEW BILLS. SINCE I MIDDLE ELECTED. THAT HAVE MORE MEANING THAN THIS ONE TO ME. BECAUSE I AM PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE TRAGEDY. THAT. THAT TOOK PLACE THAT I JUST IDENTIFIED. AND I GET FRUSTRATED OFTEN. WITH THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE FOCUS. AND I KNOW WE ALL GENERALLY HAVE. A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO OUR BEST AND THAT'S ALL ANY OF US CAN DO. BUT I. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS BILL. EVERYTHING WE CAN. SO THAT NOT ONE MORE CHILD HAS TO SUFFER. THE WAY THIS YOUNG MAN DID UNCONSCIONABLE. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LESSEN THE LIKELIHOOD. OF THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY TO TAKE PLACE. EDWARD. LEADING. DIRECTIONS. BETTER EASILY. WORKED THROUGH. GET IN THE WAY OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. A VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL AS A FAILED OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. IF THAT IS SOMETHING THIS COMMITTEE CAN'T SUPPORT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE. LAST YEAR I VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER. LACKEY AND I AND AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT ISSUE PASS ABOUT ANY OF THE BILL'S GOING FORWARD SO IT'S NOT JUST THIS ONE I KNOW YOU. IT IT FROM THE HEART. AT I KNOW WE WE WE HAD UNDERSTANDING WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE. ABOUT WE'RE NOT DISAGREEABLE. AND AND SO I. I VALUE YOUR COMMENTS AS VICE CHAIR. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOUR INPUT. AND. IF WE HAD BUT IF I HAD MORE TIME TO TO A WORK WITH YOU TO THIS. TO MAYBE PUT ANY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ON. SO THAT EVERY SYSTEM ACROSS LINES ARE WORKING TOGETHER MORE IMPORTANT SO THAT. GARRETT ANY ABUSES ON ON. WITH PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE DATABASE BECAUSE WE NEED TO NOT ONLY WORRY ABOUT. INDIVIDUALS BUT INDIVIDUALS ARE WRONGLY. PLACED ON ON THE DATABASE AND WE NEED TO PERFECT THAT ALSO. AND AND SO SHE GOT FREE RIGHT. THE TRAGEDY THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WAS IN PLACE IN LA. DIDN'T WORK. AND. JUST LIKE WHAT HAPPENED SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS WE HAVE WHERE YOU HAD. LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWING WHAT TO DO GETTING INFORMATION THEY DIDN'T RESPOND. THAT'S A TRAGEDY AND WE NEED TO REPAIR THAT ALSO. SO. I'M FOR. TRYING TO REPAIR THE SYSTEM. IN NO WAY ANYONE. ON THIS COMMITTEE. IS TRYING TO SHIELD OR OR TO HELP. PEOPLE LET KILLED YOUNG PEOPLE OR OR HARM HIM ANYWAY. AND AND I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO. HAVE TO SAY NO. TO THIS PROPOSAL BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY NECESSARY IS NOTING ANYTHING YOU BRING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. I DOES GOOD IF IT FAILS HERE TODAY AND WILL BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT INTO YOU. BUT I WANT YOU KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN BECAUSE OF A DISAPPOINTMENT AND IS NOT. BECAUSE. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT CHILDREN. BECAUSE WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE DO THE RIGHT THING. WITH THAT CADRE. SECOND.

A FOR THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MAKE SURE THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. AT SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE SCOPE OF MY BILL TO ENSURE THAT IT ONLY CAPTURES THE WISER ORIGINALLY CHARGED AND CONVICTED AS A FELONY. THERE LATER REDUCE A MISDEMEANOR NOT IDEA WHY THAT IS RACIALLY CHARGED AND CONVICTED AS A MISDEMEANOR. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING GETS ELEVATED IF THE ORIGINAL DO YOU WHY IS NOT A FELONY. ALSO THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT TAKE AWAY A JUDGE'S DISCRETION TO CHARGE IN ORIGINAL DUI OFFENSE AS A MISDEMEANOR. SO THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL TO ME BUT THIS WILL MAKE THIS.
