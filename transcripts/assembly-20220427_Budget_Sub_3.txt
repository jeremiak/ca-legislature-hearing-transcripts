WILL BEGIN NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET. ISSUE NUMBER MAKING THE PRESENTATION IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. GOOD MORNING. MORE IN THE GREAT. IT'S THE NEW NEW NORMAL OF. THE. WELL IT IS. THERE ARE STILL BE. IN ORDER FOR A LITTLE. HELLO FINALLY PALOMA OF THE CLOSE. STELLAR IS THAT BETTER CAN CAN YOU ALL HER IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM OKAY THIS- THIS. NO OUTSIDE THE WIND IS GOOD ME CRAZY. THANK YOU SO MUCH ABOUT. OR REQUIREMENTS LETTER TO VISIBILITY GREATER ACCESS OPPORTUNITY FOR CALLING. OTHER AREAS HERE. AS MANY OF YOU BEEN A OF THESE OVER MANY DECADES- THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM IS FUNDAMENTAL TO CALIFORNIA'S BOTH PERCEPTION AND REALITY OF RECYCLING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIANS RECYCLED NINETEEN BILLION- BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS REALLY QUITE- QUITE REMARKABLE MORE THAN WE'VE EVER RECYCLE BEFORE. BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE RECYCLING IN RECORD NUMBERS OF EBBERS CONTAINERS WE ARE STILL- HOVERING AROUND THE SEVENTY PER CENT RATE OF RECYCLING OF THOSE PURCHASED AT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS AGAIN THAT THIS IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO. REAP DEEP- REDEEM THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND- RECEIVED THEIR DEPOSIT BACK AND SO THIS PROPOSAL- HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO IT THAT ARE REALLY MEANT TO ONE INCREASE ACCESS TO THE OVERALL PROGRAM. AND INCREASING OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN OUR RECYCLING. THROUGH A NUMBER OF CREATIVE SOLUTIONS WE'VE BEEN TESTING ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT WE'VE SEEN WORK INOTHER STATES. AND THEN ALSO WE FEEL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN- THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS- THAT ACTUALLY INCREASE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS THAT COME FROM THIS PROGRAM SO THAT WE ARE INSURING- CONTAINER TO CONTAINER RECYCLING IN A TROOP CIRCULAR ECONOMY. WITH THAT. STOP AND I UP TO ANY OR IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL AND HAPPY TO DO THAT AS WELL WELL- FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM- THE L. A. O. AND OTHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRSE ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY THAT WE- DO THINK GIVEN RECENT DECLINES IN RECYCLING RATES. AND ISSUES WITH CONSUMER ACCESS TO ROUTE TO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. AND A SUBSTANTIAL FUND BALANCE IN THE BCRF WE DO THINK THAT PROVIDING SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO IMPROVE PROGRAM OUTCOMES DOES HAVE MERIT. HOWEVER WE THINK THIS SPECIFIC PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS DOES LACK SOME KEY DETAILS AND RAISES SOME IMPORTANT. POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. AND PERHAPS ASK THE ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF THIS. IS PART OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS I'M GONNA RUN. SOME OF THE- IN QUESTIONS WE THINK GOING FORWARD SO FIRST IS. DOES THE PROPOSAL AND DO THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL ADDRESS SO WELL IDENTIFIED PROBLEM SO FOR CERTAIN PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL SUCH AS- OPPOSED FUNDING FOR AUTOMATED RECYCLING MACHINES ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS OF THE WELL KNOWN PROBLEM. OF CONSUMER ACCESS ATTEMPTS. PLEASE CASES WE THANK THE MINISTRY HASN'T CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM OR HOW THE SPECIFI PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM SO FOR EXAMPLE. PART OF THIS PACKAGE IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TEMPORARY CONSUMER RECYCLING CREDIT. AND ACCORDING TO ADMINISTRATION THAT'S INTENDED TO KIND OF KNOW INCREASE THE C. R. V. VALUE FOR- BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE RETURNS WHERE PEOPLE WERE. STORING THOSE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THEY WERE PURCHASED OVER THAT PANDEMIC AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T RETURNED THEM YET AND SO THAT INCREASED CRP WHAT KIND OF ENCOURAGE THAT. REDEMPTION OF THOSE CONTAINERS- AND ARGUE IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF GREAT IT'S PRESENTED THAT. CONSUMERS ARE CURRENTLY. THE DISH BRIDGE CONTAINER- THAT PURCHASED AND M. ANY IF THEY ARE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE KIND OF TEMP. INCREASE IN THE C. R. V. VALUE- WOULD ENCOURAGE REDEMPTION THAT WOULD NOT A NOT HAVE OTHERWISE OCCURRED SO FOR EXAMPLE IF CONSUMERS ARE STORY IN SOMEBODY'S BEVERAGE CONTAINERS PRESUMABLY IT'S WITH THE INTENT. TO REDEEM THEM AT SOME POINT AND- THE TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE C. R. V. COULD ESSENTIALLY JUST SORT OF SHIFT THE TIMING ON WHICH THEY RETURN THOSE CONTAINERS AND NOT. AT THE OVERALL NUMBER OF TRAINERS THAT ARE RECYCLED. RUN SECOND. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THE PROPOSALS AT A CHEATING DIFFERENT RECYCLING GOALS INCLUDING INCREASING RECYCLING RATES AN INCREASE IN THE- RETENTION OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO. CONSUMERS AND STUFF IN OUR VIEW THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T PRESENTED MUCH KIND OF INFORMATION ON KIND OF WHAT OUTCOMES IT EXPECTS ON THOSE DIFFERENT METRICS. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MY ONE ASTON MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- IN THE HEARING TODAY. AND GOING FORWARD I'LL HAVE THE RESULTS FROM THE EXISTING PILOTS INFORMED THIS PROPOSAL SO AS THE COMMITTEE IS LIKELY AWARE CAL RECYCLE IS WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT. FIVE PILOT PROJECTS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO EXPAND THAT TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE PILOT PROJECTS- THE RESULTS AND OUTCOMES FROM THOSE THE EXISTING PILOTS HAVE NOT. BEEN PRESENTED YET- ANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON WHAT IT WHAT IS SEEN FROM THOSE PILOTS SO FAR KEY LESSONS THAT ARE LEARNED. AND HOW THOSE PILOTS HAVE INFORMED THIS PROPOSAL- IF THE RESULTS FROM THOSE PILOTS AREN'T AVAILABLE YET AND THE LATEST LEGISLATORS COULD CONSIDER DELAYING SOME OF THE FUN AT LEAST SOME OF THE FUNDING- UNTIL MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FROM THE RESULTS ABOUT PILOT. BOTH PILOTS. AND THEN FINALLY- DOES THE PROPOSAL PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL HAVE ONGOING BENEFITS AND THE LEGISLATURE MY WOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO TARGET FUNDING TO ACTIVITIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE ONGOING RECYCLING IMPROVE ON RECYCLING RATES AND ACCESS RATHER THAN JUST ONE TIME BENEFITS WE DO THINK SOME OF THE PROPOSALS- HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RECYCLING ARE ONGOING BASIS SUCH AS THE AUTOMATED. AUTOMATED RECYCLING MACHINES AND PROVIDING LOANS CYCLER IS THAT ARE FORGIVEN IF THOSE LAWS ARE OPERATING- FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS SO THOSE COULD HAVE SOME MULTI YOUR BENEFITS IN OTHER CASES SUCH AS THE INCREASE THE R. V. THE TEMPORARY KIND OF INCREASING CRP VALUES- WE THINK ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HAVE RESULTS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS IF THEY DO HAVE- BENEFITS AND SO. LEGISLATURE MY WANTED CORRECTED MINISTRATION TO REPORT ON WHICH OF THEIR PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO HAVE- ONGOING BENEFIT FOCUS ITS SPENDING IN THOSE AREAS SO I'LL IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- SERGEANT. AT IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEND SOMEBODY OUTSIDE AND ASKED THEM TO STOP WORKING OUT THERE UNTIL NOON. FLEX FLEX A LITTLE. FORTY I MEAN IT'S PRETTY DISTRACTING RIGHT YEAH. WE'RE GONNA TRY GREAT THANK YOU. SO THE- WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM- DEPARTMENT FINANCING YES- GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS CHRISTIAN BELGIAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REVIEWED AND ANALYZED THE EXISTING FUND BALANCE ND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION UP FROM THE FUND BALANCE IS A PRINT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES FROM THE EXISTING FUND BALANCE OF THE B. C. R. F. THE CURRENT ESTIMATED FUND BALANCE FOR BCRF IS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION. IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THIS PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT BCRF WILL MAINTAIN A PRUDENT LEVEL OF PROJECTED RESERVES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR OF- APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. DIRECTOR YOUR- THE PROPOSAL IS BASED ON- THE FACT THAT THERE'S THIS EXTRA MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT AND THE EXTRA MONEY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED PURCHASES DURING- THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC DO WE HAVE ANY OR IS THERE ANY- THOUGHT THAT- THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF PURCHASING IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON IN THE FUTURE. AND CHAPLAIN IS FOR THAT QUESTION I ATE AT APPRECIATE THAT AND HIGHLIGHTING THAT YES SO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- UNLIKE OTHER TYPES OF ECONOMIC- DISTURBANCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS FUND SOUGHT AN INCREDIBLE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THAT WERE BEING PURCHASED THAT RESULTED IN AB AT MUCH HIGHER- NUMBER OF THAT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS PURCHASED AND THEN AMOUNT ENOUGH OVERALL FIND- WE HAVE SEEN THAT CONTINUE TO DATE BUT OUR EXPECTATION IS AS- WE GET TO OUR NEW NEW NORMAL AS YOU SAY IT THAT WE WOULD SEE A LEVELING UP. OFF AND A DECREASE IN THAT OVERALL PURCHASE SO IF WE JUST THINK ANECDOTALLY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR IN HOUSEHOLDS YES WE PROBABLY WERE BUYING- CASES OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BOTTLED WATER CANNED- SO DOES ITS ADDRESS AT DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT NUMBER NO SODA I DON'T BY STATE LOOK AT THAT THE- SPARKLING. WATER IN. THE THING IN OUR HOUSEHOLD THAT IS OUR OR HEALTH. A LOT OF SPARKLY MY IN OUR BUT AS THEY- AS WE AG BACK AND THE WORKPLACE IT BACK IN A RESTAURANT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE NUMBERS OF WELL DECREASE AGAIN BACK TO MORE HISTORIC NUMBERS AND THAT'S WHY THIS PROPOSAL TREATS THIS AS AT ONE TIME- FUNDING INCREASE AS OPPOSED TO A NEW TRENDS WITHIN. THE FUND. THANKS IT WAS SO HAVE WE SEEN THE CURVE KINDA LEVEL OFF YET OR IS IT STILL- WELL IT IS. IT IS LEVELING AT THAT HIGHER LEVEL RIGHT NOW- BUT AGAIN THE WORLD IS- IS CHANGING EVERY DAY- AND SO AGAIN HAPPY TO COME BACK AND TALK TO THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR AFTER. THAT PERHAPS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AGAIN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THESE TRENDS ARE BUT THE HISTORIC TRENDS THAT WE HAVE USED FOR FORECASTING. FOR MANY MANY YEARS ARE NOT PLAYING OUT CURRENTLY SO ONE CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE- A PROPOSAL THAT YOU. I THINK IT'S VERY- GUY MADE OF- BUT ONE CONSERVER IS THAT- THAT PEOPLE- OF ANTICIPATE THAT THE RATE IS GOING TO GO. UP IN THE FUTURE AND SO THE HOLD ON TO THEIR RECYCLABLES AND HOARD THEM ESSENTIALLY AND- WAIT FOR THE- FOR THE REDEMPTION VALUE TO GO UP- IS THERE A WAY TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT. DO DID NOT SEE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN THE PAST WHEN REDEMPTION RATES WENT UP AND HAD A- EXCUSE ME AT REDEMPTION RATES BUT REDEMPTION VALUE WENT UP- ABOUT A DECADE AGO. WE DID NOT SEE THE TRENDS REALLY- WHERE PEOPLE HALTED THEIR RECYCLING AND THEN BROUGHT THEM IN AT A LATER DATE. ALSO IN OTHER STATES AS THEY BUMPED UP THE REDEMPTION VALUE YOU DID NOT SEE THAT KIND OF TREND WE HAVE HEARD THIS CONCERN BROUGHT UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS- THAT IT WAS ANECDOTALLY. ALREADY HAPPENING I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW THAT DATA WOULD HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BECAUSE NOTHING SINCE APRIL FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED. I INTO THAT PROGRAM THAT WOULD GIVE US ANY INDICATION THAT THAT WAS THE CASE- SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IF THAT BECOMES AN IT BECOMES AN ISSUE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE. THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. WE DO YOU THINK I THINK IT JUST IT ON THAT NOTE THAT- ROSS PRODUCT. AND WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS OF GETTING THOSE OF BOTTLES AND CANS THAT ARE. PERHAPS BEING HELD IN PEOPLE'S GARAGES AND- AND TODAY. IS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THE BOTTLES AND CANS I'M SHOWING UP IN LANDFILLS ARE ARE- WASTE CHARACTERIZATIONS ARE NOT SHOWING A HUGE INFLUX OF THESE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IS RECYCLABLE CONTAINERS IN OUR LANDFILLS TODAY. SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THIS IS REALLY INTENDED. TO GET WHATEVER IS OUT THERE BACK INTO THE RECYCLING SYSTEM AND THEN GET IT RE MANUFACTURED INTO NEW BEVERAGE CONTAINER. HOW DO THE INVEST SAID YOUR PER- TRANSLATE INTO- A PERMANENT CHANGES AND- RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WAS A REALLY EXCELLENT QUESTION AND CERRO. SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE MEANT TO REALLY BE- THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THE LONGER TERM. SOLUTIONS SO FOR INSTANCE WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT WITH OUR LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS OUR STATE CONSERVATION CORPS AND SOME OTHER WORK FORCE- DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO DO MOBILE RECYCLING. THAT WOULD BE A THREE TO FIVE YEAR PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY NOT A LONG TERM PROGRAM BUT REALLY MEANT TO FACILITATE A QUICK SOLUTION TO DATE TO OUR RECYCLING DESERT'S THAT EXISTS. TO GET THOSE RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO PLACES LIKE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND EVEN SOME OF OUR CITIES THAT- ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING- REDEMPTION AND- AT A LACK OF REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES AND SO. THOSE ARE REALLY MEANT TO BE QUICK TO PLACEMENT LET'S GET RETIRED RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES OUT TO EVERY CALIFORNIA AND- SEND SOME OF OUR SOLUTIONS ARE TRULY MEANT. TO FACILITATE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS IN THIS PROGRAM AND REALLY OPEN UP THIS PROGRAM TO SOME NEW CREATIVE VERY CALIFORNIA TYPE- KNOWLEDGE B. LIKE THE REVERSE VENDING MACHINES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE DEPLOYED. TO RETAILERS AND- OTHER AT STATE OR LOCAL FACILITIES AND THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO BUILD THAT BUT A REVERSE VENDING MACHINE AS WE ALL KNOW TAKES UP A LOT LESS ROOM- THEN EACH TRUCK OR A TRAILER. AND WE THINK THAT WE COULD DEPLOY A QUITE A FEW OF THOSE ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN REALLY FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT TECHNOLOGY- AND- THE WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY. AND A VERY. TYPE OF PLACE ACROSS STATE AND UNDER THE- THE UPPER CAL RECYCLE PROPOSAL FOR REVERSE VENDING MACHINES. UM THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZE THE- OF PLACEMENT OF A MACHINE- AND THEN WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR- MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION COSTS IS SO I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON AND THE TYPE OF CONTRACT THAT THE FACILITY WOULD ENTER INTO SO LET'S TAKE FOR INSTANCE- A RETAIL FACILITY WHERE WE WOULD DEPLOY WE WERE PERHAPS SUBSIDIZE THE UP FRONT COST OF PURCHASING OR LEASING THE- REVERSE VENDING MACHINE IT WOULD THEN BE PLACED- IN THE FACILITY OR AT THE GROCERY STORE AND THEN THAT- FACILITY WOULD CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY THAT PROVIDED THE RIVER SPENDING USING SO NOT UNLIKE. A VENDING MACHINE FOR- NOT GONNA USE CANDY INSTEAD OF IT. OTHER SNACKS THAT YOU WOULD GET- IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR TYPE OF CONTRACTING SITUATION SO THIS WOULD REALLY BE MEANT TO FACILITATE THOSE UP FRONT COSTS AND THEN THE FACILITIES WOULD WORK OUT THROUGH A CONTRACT. WITH THE WITH THE PROVIDER- THERE'RE- ARE A MYRIAD OF OTHER ISSUES WITH THE RECYCLING SYSTEM- FOR EXAMPLE THE CO MINGLING OF PLASTIC AND GLASS ON GLASS BREAKAGE AND- HI AND SO FORTH WHAT TO. WHAT WHAT WHAT KINDS OF SOLUTIONS IT ARE YOU LOOKING AT OR HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO MOVE FORWARD ON- THOSE- OTHER PROBLEMS STILL ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE WE ALSO GAVE A GREAT DEAL THOUGHT TO THAT AND YOU HAVE IN THE PROPOSAL THE TO. THE TO AMOUNTS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE TO QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY MEANT VERY SPECIFICALLY TO GET AT THAT ISSUE- IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR US TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRY TO RETRIEVE ALL THESE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IF IT IF ATTHE END OF THE DAY. THEY END UP IN BALES OR IN- A CONDITION THAT ISN'T RECYCLABLE AND SO MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS IN- ARE. QUALITY INCENTIVE AND- PLASTIC MATERIALS PMDP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND AT HELPS WITH INSURING THAT THEY THE MATERIALS THAT WE ARE GETTING BACK IS AT THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND RECYCLABLE AGAIN WE WANT BEVERAGE CONTAINER TO BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING WE'VE GOT INVESTMENTS ACROSS- OUR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES WHETHER IT'S GLASS RECYCLING OR PLASTICS RECYCLING OR ALUMINUM RECYCLING. pHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TRULY CAPTURE AND RECYCLE THOSE MATERIALS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MATERIALS IN THE BEST- POSSIBLE- FORM AND ANNOUNCES THOSE MATERIALS TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESSES TRULY- CIRCUIT. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED USING OF THE- FUNDS THAT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. TO INSTALL WATER REFILLING STATIONS AT SCHOOLS. SOMEBODY I KNOW HAS A BILL ON THE TOP- BUT THE BENEFIT OF THAT WOULD BE- THE- LESS USAGE OF- SINGLE USE PLASTICS PLASTICS I THINK THAT WOULD IS M. AN INNOVATIVE IDEA AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WORTH DISCUSSING THE LESS WE NEED- SINGLE USE MATERIALS THE BETTER OFF WE ARE. THIS WAS VERY MUCH AT- STRUCTURED AROUND- THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM BUT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS I'D BE HAPPY TO. AYE OKAY I LEFT MY PROP ON MY DESK AS I RUSHED OVER HERE- MIKE- REUSABLE BOTTLE THAT SAYS- WATER- WATER- ZERO GRAMS SUGAR FOR THOSE OF A- YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT ISSUE- BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE- AND APPROPRIATE USE FOR- SOME OF THOSE FUNDS. AT LAST QUESTION I HAVE- RELATES TO- THE LANGUAGE THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT EXEMPTS ALL CURRENT LAWS INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE ACT IN THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY. WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON VERY QUICKLY DEPLOYING THE SOLUTIONS AND TO GO THROUGH THE APA PROCESS OR SOME OF THESE OTHER PROCESS SEES REALLY DOESN'T GET- THE SOLUTIONS DEPLOYED IN THE NEXT YEAR IT REALLYIN THE ÁP PROCESS ON YOU KNOW NORMAL TRACK TAKES ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND SINCE THIS WAS ONE TIME FUNDS- THAT WERE MEANT TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE IS THERE TODAY. WE FELT THAT WE HAD ENOUGH INFORMATION TO HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS TO HAVE AND- A CONVERSATION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS BUT RATHER HAD ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT WE DIDN'T NEED A NEW REGULATORY PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT BUT RATHER A NEST INFORMATION TO DEPLOY VERY QUICKLY- SOME OF BASED ON SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES WE'VE HAD AROUND MOBILE RECYCLING OR REVERSE VENDING MACHINES I THINK AND OUR OUR REAL GOAL HERE WAS TO DEPLOY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SMITH. AND I'LL FOLLOW UP PRETTY MUCH FOR THE VENDING MACHINES DOCTORED ONE CANDID TIMER CAN I DON'T MY WHOLE BAG IN THERE IS A BY INDIVIDUAL BUT WAIT VOLUME HOW IS IT CALCULATED AT SO IT DEPENDS ON THE MACHINE RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE MACHINES ARE ONE CANADA TIME AND SO THIS WOULD NOT BE TO FACILITATE SOMEBODY BRINGING AND- YOU KNOW A TRUCKLOAD OF- OF- ADD BOTTLES AND CANS BUT RATHER IF YOU HAD A BACK AS- FIFTY OR SO BUT I HAVE HAD A CONGRESS. OF THE RIVER SENDING ME. AT MANUFACTURERS WHERE THEY ARE DEVISING SYSTEMS THAT CAN- CAN I TAKE IN MORE THAN ONE CONTAINER AND I RECOGNIZE A TWELVE SCANNER SIXTEEN OUNCE CAN VERSUS SMASHED. TO A YOU KNOW GOOD OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE NOT CRUSHED BEFORE GOD AND I BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE MACHINES REQUIRE IT TO NOT BE CRUSHED BUT THERE ARE AGAIN THE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS ARE DOING SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS IN TERMS OF THE DAY THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY NOW- AND- THE COMPUTERS WITHIN THE. SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO I F. BUT I. A I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A PROMISE BUT AT. KNOW THAT THE C. R. V. LAIT HAS TO BE A- FOR IT TO RE YEAH. YEAH EXACTLY. AND THEN. HOW DO I PUT HIM IN THERE IS IT. WITH THE REACH IF TO MARK OR- PARTICULAR LIQUOR STORE I GET A RECEIPT AND THEN I GOING TO GET A REFUND FROM THE- VENDOR SO SOME OF US ARE RECEIPTS WHERE YOU CAN GET A REFUND RIGHT THERE FROM THE VENDOR AND SOME OF THEM WILL DEPOSIT DIRECTLY INTO A BANK ACCOUNT IF YOU WOULD LIKE. OBSERVER OF SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS HAPPENING IN THIS AREA OF TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COMPANIES. THAT ARE REALLY EXCITED TO BE MORE PRESENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY SO. WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN. GROW HERE IN CALIFORNIA KIND OF A FOLLOW UP IN TWO SO I'VE PUT. I GOT A BAG OF LET'S JUST SAY FIFTY KHZ. I GET TWENTY FIVE IN THERE IT IS FULL. I STILL GOTTA KEEP MY OTHER TWENTY HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE HIM FOR SOMEONE TO COME TO EMPTY THAT VENDING MACHINE BEFORE I CAN COME BACK. I HAVE AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS THIS IS BEEN DEPLOYED AND STATES LIKE OREGON AND MICHIGAN THAT THEY ARE VERY QUICK TO- TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY PEOPLE TO DO IT TO COME IN AND DO THE MACHINES AND THAT. THERE IS A LOT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN. THAT COMPANY WHO'S MAINTAINING THE MACHINE AND THE MACHINE ITSELF SO THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S WITHIN TWENTY FIVE CANS OF IT SAY THEY THEY THEY DO HAVE THEMSELVES ON. AT LOGISTICS SCHEDULES IT SAID RIGHT TO MAINTAIN THE MACHINE SOMETIMES SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC SIGNAL SENSOR NOBODY HAS COME AND VISUALLY LOOK AT IT YEAH ALL OF THE MAJOR THESE REVERSE VENDING THE REPRESENTATIONS AND HAVE. SOME PRETTY INTERESTING AT TECHNOLOGY BUT COMPLEX COMPUTERS IN THEM THAT ARE COMMUNICATING AND SAID THE MAINTENANCE- THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN. DECREASING OVER TIME AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGY MAYBE JUST THE EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS MAKE. SURE THEY DON'T SMASHED THE CAN BECAUSE IT. RIGHT RIGHT THAT IT YEAH THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGE WITH- SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND REVERSE VENDING MACHINE BACKDROPS ET CETERA THE COMPUTERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ THE CRB WHEELER BE ABLE TO TRACK ALL RIGHT THIS MACHINE IS IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IT'S NOT GETTING ANY ACTIVITY AND ANOTHER ONE IS GETTING A LOT OF CAN WE PUT TWO OF THEM IN THAT AREA AND MOVE THEM AROUND THAT WAY TOO EIGHT EXACTLY THAT IS BENEFITS I THINK OF THIS PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY AGAIN BECAUSE- THEY- HAVE THESE- COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THEN. THAT THE ABILITY TO COLLECT SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT. THE KINDS OF MATERIALS THAT ARE COMING BACK WHEN THEY'RE COMING BACK AT HOW MUCH A MACHINE IS BEING USED WILL BE- ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. I AM AM I CORRECT THAT- WHAT THE- REDEMPTION VALUE IS RETURNED TO THE CONSUMER IN THE FORM OF A- CREDIT- FOR USE AT TO A- OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER USED THE COINSTAR MACHINES- BUT I USED TO OUR- CLIENTS AND THAT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO RETURN- BUT YOU WOULD GET THERE YOU GET A COUPON BACK FOR AND YOU CAN CHOOSE- EITHER I THINK FOR THE STORE- CREDIT AT THE STORE THAT YOU'RE- IN. OR THROUGH AMAZON OR- OTHER PLACES TOO AND OUR CURRENT STATUTE REQUIRES THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABILITY TO CASH RIGHT ON THE SPOT SO- ALL RIGHT SOME OF- IT I WOULD THINK AT A RETAILER IF IT WERE GOING TO MEET THAT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET CASH ON THE SPOT BUT SAY YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAD SUGGESTED AND ONE OF OUR MEETINGS. WHEN THIS BE INTERESTING TO DEPLOY A AT SAY A LIBRARY WALL LIBRARY OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A CASH BOX SITTING THERE TO DEPLOY BUT THAT FACILITY COULD PERHAPS HAVE SOMETHING THAT- WOULD BE A CREDIT THAT YOU COULD USE OR AGAIN. AND IF YOU HAVE A PAYPAL OR VENMO ACCOUNT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THAT MONEY CAN GO DIRECTLY FROM THE MACHINE INTO YOUR ACCOUNT SO THERE ARE SOME OF REALLY INNOVATIVE IDEAS- THAT AGAIN IF WE ARE. LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO MEET EVERY SINGLE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE STATUTE THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO DO THAT AND IT WILL HELP DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY EVEN FURTHER. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO EXCELLENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PLEDGES SEEN. I THINK OUR FRIENDLY- CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OUTSIDE OF PICKING UP EVEN NOISIER TOOLS. OKAY MAYBE WE CAN SEND SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN THE HALLWAY OUT TO. TALK TO THEM. MR A- KNOCKED OUR WELCOME. ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT THE SIGMA PROGRAM YEAH THANK YOU AND GOVERNMENT CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THE GROUNDWATER IS A CRUCIAL RESOURCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SIGMA IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO CREATE PLANS TO MANAGE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLY- MANY GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES SUBMITTED THEIR PLANS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR THEIR EVALUATION- THE DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND TWELVE OF THOSE BASINS TO HAVE INCOMPLETE PLANS FOR A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. WHICH MEANS THE BOARD MAY BE CALLED UPON FOR ITS PRIMARY ROLE IN SIGMA WHICH IS TO INTERVENE IN BASINS WHERE PLANS HAVE BEEN FOUND DEFICIENT TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER AND OTHER WATER USES SO THIS SPRING FINANCE LETTER IS A REQUEST TO EXPAND OUR SEGMENTS HEME- SO THAT WE CAN CARRY OUT THOSE IMPORTANT ROLES. GREAT TO HAVE- REPORT. GOOD MORNING AVERAGE EILERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NICE TO SEE YOU IN PERSON- WE DON'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE JUST WANNA FLAG FOR YOU THAT THIS ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION- THAT'S BEING REQUESTED IS ONGOING GENERAL FUND AND THE SIGMA LEGISLATION ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THAT THIS OVERSIGHT REGULATORY ROLE BY THE WATER BOARD WOULD BE FUNDED BY FEES OF AFFECTED- GROUNDWATER BASINS. SO IT IS IT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF PREMATURE AT THIS POINT AS THINGS ARE JUST GETTING UP AND RUNNING TO IDENTIFY WHO WOULD PAY AND WHAT THE RATES WOULD BE AND BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE MONEY TO FUND THE STAFF THAT ARE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY WILL WANT TO REVISIT IN A FEW YEARS AS- AS THOSE STRUCTURES AND FEES CHARGING M. SYSTEMS CAN BE PUT IN PLACE- BECAUSE AGAIN THE ORIGINAL INTENTION IS THAT THIS WOULD BE A- KIND OF BENEFICIARY PAYS TYPE APPROACH RATHER THAN A GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED ACTIVITY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT CRYSTAL SURE. POSTER HERE CRYSTALS ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF LAND RAFIA- I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS FROM THE ALLEY- TO JUST FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AGREES THAT ULTIMATELY THE INTENT OF SIGMA WAS- THAT THAT FEES WOULD PAY FOR THE WORK ABOUT THE WATER BOARD THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL- BUT ALSO ECHO THE UNCERTAINTY OF HOW THE FEES WOULD BE SET. AND ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE A LAG- IN WHEN THOSE FEES ARE COLLECTED SO AT THIS POINT WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PROVIDE SOME ONGOING GENERAL FUND JUST GIVEN THE CRITICAL NATURE OF- OF THIS WORK AND WE FULLY INTEND ON REVISITING THIS IN THE FUTURE ULTIMATELY I'M SHIFTING- THESE RESOURCES. AS APPROPRIATELY TO THE FEES. THANK YOU I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED. THAT UNTIL NOON. THAT IS GOING TO STOP. THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION pTHAT I'VE BEEN HERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU ALL APPRECIATE IT- WHAT THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT- I'M IS NOT POWER- Y. A. DOES THIS ACTION NOT QUALIFY FOR A- A SEQUEL A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION. SO UNDER UNDERSTOOD MASS WRITTEN A SEQUEL- IS REQUIRED FOR A STATE WATER BOARD INTERIM PLANNED ACTIVITIES- IT WAS JUST HOW HOW STIGMA WAS WAS DRAFTED- EVEN THOUGH OUR ROLE IN SEGMENT IS INTENDED TO BE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS- M. AND- TO. GET OUT OF THE WAY AGAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL- FOR- UNENCUMBERED LOCAL MANAGEMENT- YEAH IT WAS IT WAS DRAFTED TO INCLUDE SEQUOIA SO THE SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS ARE ACTUALLY DRAFTED INTO. THE SEGMENT PLAN OR SIGMA DOES NOT EXEMPT THE STATE WATER BOARDS INTERIM PLANNING PROCESS FROM SEQUEL- THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD DO SO- THAT THE GOAL THERE WOULD BE TO ENSURE THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN ACT IN THESE BASINS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND DEFICIENT IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER BUT- SO BUT MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR- A- CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION WOULD EXIST IN ANY EVENT- I'M NOT SURE. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M. ONE OPTION- THAT WE COULD HAVE IF I COULD- THAT UTILIZE SIMPLY WANTED TO WOULD BE TO JUST PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR A- A SEQUEL AND ALICE'S IS THERE A REASON- WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD HE REASON BE FOR NOT DOING THAT- THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION THAT IS THAT IS AN APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE IT IT WOULD STILL DELAY- THE PROCESS OF STATE INTERVENTION WHERE IT WHERE IT IS NEEDED- BY BY A COUPLE OF YEARS POTENTIALLY AND THEN- CAN YOU. TELL US WHAT THE- CONSEQUENCES OF- WAITING A COUPLE YEARS WOULD BE YEAH THE SIGNAL WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A WHOLE RANGE OF UNDESIRABLE RESULTS INCLUDING. A DEPLETION OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS THAT CAUSE PEOPLE ON SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WELLS TO RUN OUT OF WATER- OTHER UNDESIRABLE RESULTS INCLUDE A SUBSIDENCE OF THE LAND SURFACE THAT CAN BREAK OR DISRUPT INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER BOARDS ROLE- THROUGH THROUGH STATE INTERVENTION- WOULD ALLOW A LOT OF. GROUND WATER CONDITIONS EITHER WORSEN OR OR CONTINUE- IN A IN A PROBLEMATIC WAY. THANK YOU CAN I. ADD SOMETHING- SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT- CURRENTLY- UNDER UNDER STIGMA WHEN A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING SORT OF THE PLAN THEY HAVE A SEQUEL EXEMPTION SO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU IS ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING. AN EQUIVALENT- ACTUALLY MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESSER SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE STATE BOARD IN THOSE EVENTS WHERE THEY HAVE TO TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE INTERIM PLAN SO IT'S JUST A KIND OF PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY- WITH THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES WHEN THEY'RE DEVELOPING THESE PLANS. SO CERTAINLY WE COULD PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR A SEQUEL COMPLIANCE BUT WE JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A POTENTIALLY SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- YOU KNOW FOR EACH BASIN A LITTLE TAMALE FALLS UNDER THE WATER BOARD SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS- THE CORRECT WAY TO SORT OF REDUCE COSTS. ON THE STATE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH- IF THE LOCALS WERE- TAKING ON THESE ACTIONS AND THEN ALSO IT IT- EXPEDITE SOME OF THE WORK HERE- AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER SMITH QUESTIONS. EXCUSE ME IF WE CAN HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR THE SEQUEL FOR THE- SIGMA. CAN WE EXEMPT UP FOR WATER STORAGE PROJECTS FROM PROP ONE THAT WE GET INTO FOR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO START GET SOME OF THESE WATER PROJECTS MOVING A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE OF THE SITE SO I THINK IT I WANT TO SEE OUR SAY FORTY EIGHT OF FIFTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR CAN WE WAIVE THE EXEMPTION OR CAN THE GOVERNOR TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN START WATER PROJECTS. STORAGE RIGHT NOW. SO I DON'T HAVE A AN ANSWER FOR YOU IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THE WATER STORAGE PROJECTS OR I'M A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT THEY WERE- SET IN. AND VINYL WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED KIND OF A CURRENCY FOR EXEMPTION SO. I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT WOULD NECESSARILY PRECLUDE- A SEQUEL EXEMPTION BUT WOULD JUST TO SAY THAT THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISH AND- IN PROP ONE IS. IS SOMEWHAT PURPOSEFUL AND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS THAT KIND OF NEED TO BE- THEY NEED TO BE TAKEN. I THINK THE OTHER THING HERE IS THAT WE'RE THERE WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TOO QUICK SECTION FOR THE FOR THE- THE WATER BOARD A STATE ENTITY TO. TO DO THAT WORSE IS THE PROP ONE PROJECTS WHICH ARE REALLY. I'M KIND OF LOCALLY DRIVEN- PROJECTS AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT. THE WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS UNDERTAKING CONSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES- IN MANY CASES WHEREAS THE STATE WATER BOARDS INTERIM PLAN ACTIVITIES ARE. UNLIKELY DO SO THESE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE- RESTRICTIONS ON PUMPING FOR EXAMPLE OR REQUIREMENTS TO COLLECT INFORMATION. RATHER THAN ACTUAL- CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. FOR WATERFORD AND THEN- ZERO GROUND WATER SYSTEM WILL AGENCIES HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO FIX THE PLANS SHOULD NEVER BE PROPOSALS THAT INCLUDE SOME FUNDING TO HELP HIM GET IN COMPLIANCE- YES THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAVE GOTTEN- FUNDING OVER THE YEARS FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF SIGMA. RELATED ASSISTANCE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN LEADING THE WAY IN THIS- IN IN IN PART ACTUALLY GETTING GETTING THIS- SPRING FINANCE LETTER FUNDED THROUGH GENERAL FUND IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER WAY OF REDUCING COSTS TO LOCALS- IN THE INTERIM BASIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE FUNDED. THROUGH FEES. AT ONE TIME AND I THINK I HEARD YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S ONLY TWELVE OF CURRENTLY AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE THEIR TWELVE GROUNDWATER BASINS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE SOME OF SOME OF THOSE HAVE SEVERAL AGENCIES IN THEM- IT DIDN'T HELP. MESSAGE CENTER. CENTRAL NORTHERN SOUTHERN ARE ALL TWELVE OF THEM. THERE IS A LARGE OTHER LARGE LARGELY IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY OKAY- THANK YOU. FOR NOW THE PRESENTATIONS APPRECIATED WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE OIL AND GAS AND FORSMAN COMMUNITY PROTECTION. WE'VE GOT TO THEIR RESOURCES BOARD. HERE TO PRESENT. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING I THINK YOU CHAIR BLOOMIN MEMBERS I MY NAME'S HEATHER KAROS I'M ASSISTANT DIVISION CHIEF FOR CARBS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY- ARE PROPOSAL FOR OIL AND GAS ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION- CARB IS REQUESTING A TOTAL OF SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS INITIATIVE- THREE OF THE NEW POSITIONS AS WELL AS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IN CONTRACT FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR STAFF TRAINING- TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON EMPLOYEE. INITIATIVE AT OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA- THESE POSITIONS AND CONTRACT DOLLARS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE OIL AND GAS GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUND- AT AN ANNUAL COST OF SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE OTHER THREE NEW POSITIONS WILL FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING THE INITIATIVE AT OIL AND GAS IMPORTATION REFINING% AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES- THESE POSITIONS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND AT AN ANNUAL COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- CAL JIM IT REGULATES THE EXTRACTION OF OIL AND GAS FROM WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS REGULATE- EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND GAS WELLS AND OTHER SOURCES OF EMISSIONS CARBS ROLE IS TO REGULATE AND ENFORCE GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAMS AND OVERSEE DISTRICT EMISSION REDUCTION REGULATORY. PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS- THE PURPOSE OF THIS PIECE P. TO ASSESS OIL AND GAS FACILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FORMAL COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY CARP. FROM LOCALS INCLUDING THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND TO COLLABORATE WITH AIR DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AIR REGULATIONS ARE DELIVERING ON THEIR PURPOSE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH- THIS INITIATIVE WILL INCLUDE REGULAR INSPECTIONS AND REVIEWS THAT THESE FACILITIES- ALLOWING CARP STAFF IN CONSULTATION WITH RELEVANT. REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PRODUCE SUMMARY REPORTS THAT DETAIL COMPLIANCE STATUS- MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS- THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PROGRAM- BUT IT IS A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT STAFF TO ADDRESS A NEED IN OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY EXISTING. RESOURCES EXAMPLES OF EXISTING PROGRAMS INCLUDE CARBS STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD ERROR NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES OR SNAPS- CHARACTER WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE AIR QUALITY AND COMMUNITIES NEAR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND INCLUDES A HEALTH ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY- WE HAVE. AND CARBS COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM FOCUSES ON REDUCING EXPOSURE AND COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY AIR POLLUTION I'M COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT NEW STRATEGIES TO MEASURE AIR POLLUTION AND REDUCED HEALTH IMPACTS- THE FIRST OF ITS KIND STATEWIDE EFFORT INCLUDES COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING AND COMMUNITY MISSIONS. REDUCTION PROGRAMS HOWEVER AS MENTIONED CARB IS RECEIVING COMPLAINTS ABOUT OIL AND GAS FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY- THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS- SO APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP CURB BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THESE COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES IN AIR QUALITY REGULATOR- THE RESULTS OF REPORTS REVIEWS AND INSPECTIONS FROM THIS PROGRAM. WILL HELP TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS AT THE FACILITY LEVEL ANY POTENTIAL EMISSIONS SOURCES IDENTIFIED THROUGH MONITORING AND CONCERNS RAISED TO CARVE THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- WHAT THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE- CARDS STAFF RECENTLY CONDUCTED JOINT INSPECTIONS WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS STAFF IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IN FOR OIL AND GAS FIELDS NEAR THE CITIES OF SHAFTER IN ARBIN AND DURING THESE INSPECTIONS CARB STAFF NOTED THREE LEAKS IN EXCESS OF ONE THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION METHANE. AND IDENTIFIED EQUIPMENT OPERATING ON SITE THAT WAS NOT COVERED BY LOCAL DISTRICT PERMIT- SO CARDSTOCK REFERRED REFERRED THESE ISSUES TO THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT- WHICH ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SO THIS PROPOSAL. WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED RESOURCES TO INCREASE OUR ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO SERVE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION. BY ENSURING THAT STATE AND LOCAL POLICIES ARE DELIVERING BENEFITS AS THEY WERE INTENDED- THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER BROWN. THANK YOU AGAIN- SO FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH KIND OF THE STATED GOALS OF COURSE OF THE PROPOSAL OF- KIND OF- INSURING MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION- OUR MAIN ISSUES I THINK ARE KIND OF AROUND YOU KNOW WHO CAN WHETHER THIS IS KIND OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY USE OF RESOURCES AND KIND OF WHO CONDUCTS THESE ACTIVITIES MORE OF THE EXISTING LEVEL OF RESOURCES SO. WE RECOMMEND IN THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES HERE AT THE HEARING TODAY- ADULT RUN THROUGH I THINK REALLY THE THREE MAIN QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ONE IS. WHY SHOULD THE STATE FOCUS ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON MONITORING OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION FACILITIES RATHER THAN OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES MOBILE SOURCES- SUCH AS DIESEL TRUCKS AND EQUIPMENT ARE REALLY THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND SO. A QUESTION OUR MIND IS WHY YOU KNOW THE MINISTRATION FOCUS KIND OF ITS LIMITED RESOURCES HERE ON OIL AND GAS FACILITIES RATHER THAN SOME OF THESE OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION- SECOND. WHY ISN'T. AND OF NEW UNIT AT LEAST THAT WAS KIND OF HOW WE UNDERSTOO THE PROPOSAL THAT PERHAPS- PERHAPS THERE ISN'T A NEW UNIT BUT NEW RESOURCES AT LEAST NEEDED- AT CARB CARB ALREADY HAS. SOME EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STAFF RESOURCES AS WAS MENTIONED THAT ARE DEDICATED TO SIMILAR ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE THE- STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD ERROR- NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES TO CHARACTERIZE AIR QUALITY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. THE GREAT BRITAIN TOXICS REPORTING REGULATION AND OTHER RESOURCE- RESEARCH EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ONE ASK CARP TO EXPLAIN WHY THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE. AND RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT AND TO MEET ITS GOALS. AND FINALLY EVEN IF MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF OIL AND GAS FACILITIES AND REFINERIES WHY IS. CAR BURLY KIND OF THE BEST ENTITY TO CONDUCT THESE EFFORTS SO AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW GENERALLY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE. HAVE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGULATING- THE STATIONARY SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND SO. WHY ARE RESEARCH MORE RESOURCES NEEDED A CAR RATHER THAN LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THEY'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOMIN MEMBERS BRANDON MEREDITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS OIL AND GAS PROPOSALS PRUDENT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES THAT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING RESOURCES. AND SERVICES TO EXPAND UPON CRITICAL EMISSIONS COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT FOR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. THE SIX POSITIONS WILL SERVE TO BOLSTER LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS MONITORING FUNCTIONS AND PROVIDE MORE TIMELY RESPONSE. TO COMPLAINTS FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES REGARDING NOXIOUS AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL EMISSIONS FROM THESE OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. THANK YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HOUSE. THANK YOU- MISSED A CURIOUS DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A STAB AT ANSWERING THE THREE QUESTIONS THAT TO. MISTER BROWN ASKED SAID THE FIRST ONE WAS- WHY FOCUS ON THE SOURCE OF POLLUTION SURE- SO. I THINK AND I THINK PART OF THE QUESTION IS WHY NOT MOBILE SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE SO CARP ALREADY HAS EXTENSIVE AND TRANSPARENT- ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON REGULATIONS THAT WE ENFORCE DIRECTLY- ESPECIALLY ON MOBILE SOURCES- BUT WE'RE FOCUSING THIS REQUEST ON OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION DISTRIBUTION AND REFINING BECAUSE THESE PROCESSES ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF AIR EMISSIONS- AND SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CARPETS RECEIVED- A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FORMAL COMPLAINTS RELATED TO REFINERIES AND OIL GAS. AND OIL AND GAS FIELD OPERATIONS- AND THESE COMPLAINTS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ORDERS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS- MONITORED EXCESS EMISSIONS BLACK SMOKE AND FLARING- ALSO IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THROUGH OUR EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PRO- WHICH CARBON STOP WISHED I'M SORRY CARCASS OUT WHICH THE COMMUNITY- PROTECTION PROGRAM THROUGH AB SIX ONE SEVEN. AM TO REDUCE EXPOSURE IN COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY AIR POLLUTION- AND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES SELECTED THROUGH THAT PROGRAM- CONTAIN OR ARE LOCATED ADJACENT TO OIL AND GAS FACILITIES- AND SO AS AN EXAMPLE WILMINGTON'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN- COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN- INCLUDED TWO OF THEIR TOP AIR QUALITY QUALITY PRIORITIES INVOLVED WELL- ADMISSIONS FROM OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS- AND MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES SUCH AS RICHMOND IN THE BAY AREA AND COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ARE EXPRESSING THE SAME SENTIMENT TO US- AND SO. WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD THIS INITIATIVE- IN THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TO HELP DIRECTLY ANSWER COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS- RAISED BY LAW UNITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED- BY THE LOCAL AGENCIES THUS FAR. THANK YOU- AUNT- WHY A- SECOND QUESTION WAS WHY A- A NEW UNIT OR PROGRAM WHY NOT USE EXISTING. PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES YEAH- SO THIS- TO CLARIFY IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM IT WOULD JUST BE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL NEED AND ART IN OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ISN'T COVERED BY EXISTING RESOURCES- AND SO THE PROPOSAL THAT E HAVE HERE WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING AIR MONITORING PROGRAMS- SUCH AS THE REFINERY FENCE LINE AND SNAPS. AND THE COMMUNITY MONITORING ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS- HARBINGERS EVEN COMPLY GAME CARDS RECEIVING COMPLAINTS ABOUT OIL AND GAS FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY SO THE AIR MONITORING IS A LITTLE MORE HOLISTIC AND WERE RECEIVING COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FACILITIES MORE SPECIFICALLY- AND THAT OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS AREN'T REALLY DESIGNED TO ANSWER OR INVESTIGATE THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS- AND SO BY WORKING WITH FAIR DISTRICTS STAFF- WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THESE COMPLAINTS AND WORK TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY- WHICH WILL HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND AIR QUALITY REGULATORS- AND THEN WHAT WE CAN DO IS USE. THE RESULTS OF THEIR REPORTS AND INSPECTIONS ETCETERA THAT WE OBTAIN THROUGH OUR IN DEPTH ANALYSIS- TO- TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS- AND SO AGAIN THE REQUEST IS MORE COMPLIMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING RESOURCES- FILLING SORT OF A GAP THAT WE DON'T HAVE AT THE MOMENT. WHICH IS WHY YOU THINK UP A CARP IS BEST SITUATED TO HOW TO ADDRESS THESE IS RIGHT SO CARB SO CAL JIM- REGULATE SORT OF THE EXTRACTION BUT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS REGULATE AIR EMISSIONS AND THEN CORPORATE TEENS OVERSIGHT SO CARBS ROLE HERE IS A LITTLE BIT TWO FOLD SO-WE- HAVE OUR METHANE EMISSIONS REGULATION- THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IN THAT WE DIRECTLY ENFORCE- AND THEN CARP ALSO HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES OVER THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS- AND SO. BYE BYE IN MINISTRY IN THOSE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES AND INVESTIGATING OUR OWN REGULATIONS- WILL BE ABLE WERE IN SORT OF A BETTER POSITION TO ENSURE MORE CONSISTENT AND ROBUST ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL RULES- TO EVALUATE COMPLIANCE AND- MAKE SURE YOU KNOW IDENTIFY ANY SORT OF PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE. EIGHT THANK YOU- I GUESS I WOULD HAVE- AT- THAT THIS REQUEST IS RATHER MODEST AT SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF WE WERE TO- ASK ANOTHER AGENCY TO DO IT I CAN'T IMAGINE THE REQUEST WOULD BE ANY LESS SO. ANY OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MR FONG. I MAY HAVE MISSED THIS OR MAYBE I CAN ASK FOR CLARIFICATION- WHY I THINK THE THIRD QUESTION FROM DELEO IS WHY NOT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. INSTEAD OF CARP. REYES THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS DO DIRECTLY REGULATE- THE SOURCES OF EMISSIONS- BUT AGAIN- CARB IS RECEIVING SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT ISSUES- THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING FROM THE SOURCES AND SO CARB. THROUGH ITS DIRECT ENFORCEMENT OF OUR METHANE REGULATIONS AND OUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES CAN SURE ENSURE MORE CONSISTENT SORT OF STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE. PROVIDE A SUPPORT TO THE DISTRICTS- TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE- AND YOU KNOW IDENTIFIES SORT OF ANY HOLISTIC- PROBE PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAYBE COULD BE MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE AS HEALTH PROTECTIVE AS POSSIBLE. SALEMME DEL DOWNLOADED DEEPER. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE LOCAL DISTRICTS CAN'T DO IT OR ARE DOING A GOOD JOB A WHITE MALE. IF YOU'RE GETTING COMPLAINTS I'M ASSUMING THE LOWER DESERTING THE SAME COMPLAINTS SO WHY TO DUPLICATION. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE WOULD LIKE SOME RESOURCES TO MAYBE DELVE INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE- IT COULD BE THAT- THINGS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED NOT SURE WHY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE- BUT AGAIN CARB HAS OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS SORT OF IN LINE WITH THOUGHT- RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP SORT OF IDENTIFY WHY THAT'S HAPPENING AND WHY THAT'S THE CASE. SAID SO JUST BE CLEAR YOU DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS YOU JUST. WANT TO DO IT. I MEAN WE SEE THAT THERE ARE ISSUES BECAUSE WE'RE RECEIVING COMPLAINTS- BUT TO UNDERSTAND IN MORE DEPTH MAYBE WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE WE NEED SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARC WE HAVE CURRENT OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO PERFORM- NOT SPECIFIC TO A OIL AND GAS AND SO AS A RESULT OF RECEIVING THESE COMPLAINTS WE WOULD LIKE TO. DELVE INTO THAT INFO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT OKAY BUT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE JUST THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB I PERSONALLY. DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY IT MAYBE I CAN HAS L. L. A. IS THERE A SITUATION WHERE. ARE THEY ARE DISTRICTS NOT DOING. SOMETHING THAT THEY CARP NEED TO DO. I MEAN I DON'T THINK- EXAMPLES OF THAT HAVE SORT OF BEEN PRESENTED TO US- I KNOW THERE WAS. SOME MENTION THAT AND THE BOARD'S PRESENTATION OF KIND OF SOME INSPECTIONS THAT THEY WERE DOING WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THAT'S KIND OF HIS PARTLY DRIVEN. THAT'S HERE THEY DID FIND SOME LEAKS BUT I GUESS IT'S UNCLEAR TO US KIND OF. WEATHER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF CAUGHT BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ALONG THE WAY ANYWAYS OR YOU KNOW HOW KIND OF PREVALENCE OF SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS MIGHT BE SO I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE ARE. AWARE OF A LOT OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WELL LET ME ASK CARP IN THIS QUESTION DO YOU GET COMPLAINTS. FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE DO GET COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES- WE DO RECEIVE A LOT OF MOBILE SOURCE AND- PROGRAM COMPLAINTS AS WELL WHICH WE- INVESTIGATE- WE DO- BUT WE ALSO RECEIVED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- THE ONE THING I WILL HIGHLIGHT AS WE HAVE GONE OUT AND DONE JOINT INSPECTIONS WITH DISTRICTS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED- EXIGENCES. OF EMISSIONS REGULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE- AND HAVE WORKED WITH THE DISTRICT TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES- BUT SOMETIMES A YOU KNOW IT TAKES A SORT OF. OF GOING IN THERE AND DO NOT A VALUATION UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND HELP TRY TO RESOLVE IT. OKAY SO THEN- SO AND WHEN YOU GO AND MADE SAID I USED TO PLAY SO YOU SAY YOUR COMPLIMENTARY SET AND IS THERE DISTRICTS DO THEIR THING AND YOU DO YOUR THING OR DO YOU GUYS GO IN TOGETHER. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT TWO LAYERS KIND OF COMING IN TOGETHER. WE DO GO IN TOGETHER WE OFTEN DO JOINT INSPECTIONS WITH THEIR DISTRICTS. OKAY BUT- WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU GO WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL LOCAL AIR DISCONTENT THEMSELVES. TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE- THE- REGULATIONS ARE BEING COMPLIED WITH- TWO PART SO. MAYBE TAKING A STEP BACK PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE INCLUDES EVALUATING DISTRICT PROGRAMS TUITION INSURE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS- AND SO THAT'S PART OF US GOING OUT THERE- WITH THE DISTRICT STUFF IS TO- YOU KNOW. SEE WHAT THEIR RULES ARE SEE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE SORT OF DO THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AIR. AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OKAY SO YOU BASIC CHECKING ON THEIR DISTRICTS. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT YEAH I MEAN THAT'S PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE. OKAY YEAH. THANK YOU TO RETIRED PROGRAMS. WITH YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A COULD BE IMPROVED YOU GO TO THE OIL AND GAS FACILITIES BUT ARE WE MONITORING OFF SHORE WITH ALL THE- TANKERS AND SHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN OFF THE COAST FOR THE LAST YEAR. IN COMPARISON TO WHAT ON LONG DISTANCE ON LAND VERSUS THE OCEAN BECAUSE THAT AIR HOME IT'S COMING ON IS THERE COMPARISON OR ANY STUDIES THAT WERE IN THE LAST YEAR THAT HAVE BEEN UP THERE WITH THE CAR. THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT- EVERYTHING THAT I AM SORT OF INVOLVED IN AND AWARE OF IS MORE OF THE- THE DRILLING THAT'S OCCURRING ON LANDS. IS A TOPIC THAT SORT YEAH CONCENTRATING HERE BUT WE GOT A BIG PROBLEM OUT HERE IN THE OCEAN. AND THAT ERROR I MEAN THERE'S NOT A FINE LINE WHERE DOESN'T COME ACROSS THE BASE SO WHEN WE GET THAT MAYBE YOU CAN. GET THAT ANSWER FOR. SURE NOT THAT I'M THE AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE PORTS OF TAKING A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR- MAKING SURE THAT- OF THOSE- SHIPS THAT ARE- AWAITING BOOK- BEING UNLOADED. ARE STAGING AND THE MANY OF THEM ARE REMAINING OUT TO AT SEA BEFORE THEY COME IN. SO THAT THERE'S LESS POLLUTION AND- DIRECTLY IN THE PORT AREAS. LET THAT'S ONE STEPS THAT THEY'VE TAKEN. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US OF EXPERT BUT THAT. AIR IN THE OCEAN. WE GET ON SHORE FLOW IT COMES ON THE LAND OH TO BE SURE HAVE SOME KIND OF COMPARISON AND CHECK BECAUSE WE'RE GOING AFTER THE- OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. BUT IF BECAUSE MIGHT BE OUT THE OCEAN WITH ALL THE SHIPS RIGHT NOW. THEY WERE BLAMING WHAT WE'RE DOING OVER HERE SO AT OF THE THINK WE NEED A COMPARISON. AND A LOOK AT IT. AND WE CAN DELIVER HERE A LOT BETTER THAN THEY DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE IF WE'RE STILL IMPORT THE SAME AMOUNT OF IL. WE'RE STILL USING THE SAME AMOUNT. AND THAT THIS CRITICAL. THANK YOU GREAT. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND- OUR NEXT. ISSUE IS ISSUE FOR WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL HERE TO TALK ABOUT- FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL PROGRAM. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE HOW AM IS STATE FARM MARSHALL I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS ANY CLARIFICATION- FROM OUR NEEDS REQUEST TO ADD TWELVE ADDITIONAL- PERSON NOW TO THE FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION- WITH ONGOING COSTS AMOUNTING TO APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CAMPUS PER YEAR TO SUPPORT THE OVERSIGHT. OF AN EXISTING AMMO YOU- WITH EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. WHY THIS WHY NOW WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT THE L. A. CAME UP WITH- UNDERSTANDABLY. SO FOR A LITTLE BACKGROUND HISTORICALLY- THE MO YOU WHICH DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY- OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO EACH CAMPUS WAS ISSUED IN LARGE PART. DUE TO PREVIOUS DEPUTIES OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE WHO WENT TO THE UC SYSTEM EITHER BY CHOICE OR THROUGH LAYOFFS- AT THE- SFM. THAT STAFF WAS WELL VERSED IN THE ENFORCEMENT ROLES OF OUR OFFICE AS WELL AS THE CO DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES THAT- CREATED THE CODES THAT THEY NEEDED TO ENFORCE- THAT GAVE THEM A REALLY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE WISE AND WHAT FORCE. OF THAT ENFORCEMENT JOB THAT THEY HAD TO ENSURE THAT FIRING MY SAFETY FOR- NOT JUST- THE STAFF- BUT YOU KNOW FACULTY STUDENTS AND EVEN THE FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURES THAT WE SEE ON ON THE UC CAMPUSES- ADDITIONALLY HAVING THAT STAFF FROM OUR STAFF- HAD THOSE. CLOSE CONTACT AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW PICK UP THE PHONE PHONE A FRIEND AND TO ANSWER ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS- WHICH ALLOWED FOR US TO FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT AND IN THE- CODES THAT WERE BEING ENFORCED ON EACH OF THE CAMPUSES- NOW AND SORT OF. BY WAY OF A DISCLAIMER- ALL NOTE THAT OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION DUE TO- POTENTIAL LITIGATION CIVIL AND POSSIBLY CRIMINAL LITIGATION WE AREN'T ABLE TO DISCUSS IN DETAIL SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WERE ASKED BUT- ANECDOTALLY I WILL TALK ABOUT A- A- UNIVERSITY ITSELF THAT- WE WERE NOTIFIED BY AN HOUR GROWING IT DOESN'T NEED TO CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL THAT THEY WERE LEAVING THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY ONE. ON THAT FACILITY- AND THAT THEY WOULD BE RETIRING. WE WILL. REACH OUT WE HEARD NOTHING FROM THE CAMPUS ITSELF- WE REACH OUT TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO EXPLAIN- THAT WE NEEDED SOMEBODY IN THERE- THAT SINCE THAT AUTHORITY LIES WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT IF THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WE HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THERE SO WE- DID SOME CHANGING OF STAFFING AND RE DIRECTED STAFF TO THAT FACILITY- WHAT WAS FOUND AT THAT FACILITY- WAS QUITE CONCERNING WE FOUND- ISSUES WITH- THE CONSTRUCTION. THE OTHER- INSPECTIONS THAT WERE DONE AND- WE'RE REALLY TROUBLED BY THE SITUATION ESPECIALLY AS WE PUT PUT STAFF THERE TO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS IT BECAME MORE AND MORE OF A CONCERN TO US THAT THE ACTUAL AUTHORITY LIES WITHIN THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. WE'VE DELEGATED IT AND WE HAVEN'T. WE DIDN'T FOLLOW UP- IT OCCURRED TO US THAT WE REALLY REALLY NEEDED TO STEP UP THERE WAS HAS BEEN A- QUITE A BIT OF FUNDS- TO THE UC SYSTEMS THAT. AND PLANS FOR LOTS OF- NEW CONSTRUCTION AND- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO BE DONE AND OUR OUR GREAT CONCERN WAS THAT IT WOULDN'T BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OR MAY NOT BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH. WITH THE ACTUAL CODES OF THAT THAT ARE IN A FACT- I LOST MY PLACE BECAUSE I WAS. DOING MY THING HERE HAD- A CONTEST SO OUR OFFICE- WORKS REALLY WELL CLOSELY WITH THE- UNIVERSITY AND CAMPUS ITSELF WE WORKS TO REVIEW THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF THEIR CANDIDATES THAT THEY HAD AS A- TO HIRE FROM- WE SAT IN ON A HIRING PANEL WITHOUT UNIVERSITY. WE STAYED ON SITE WE DID- LOTS OF TRAINING FOR THAT THAT CHOSEN CANDIDATE. AND TRYING TO BRING THEM UP TO SPEED ON BOTH THE WAY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL DOES THEIR JOB AND ENFORCEMENT. AND THE CAMPUS PROJECTS THAT WERE MID PROJECT MID CONSTRUCTION- AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT WE HAD FOUND AND IDENTIFIED THAT NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED- AGAIN AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELEGATION WAS REALLY EXPLORED AND- THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL FELT THAT IT WAS. IMPORTANT THAT WE REACH OUT WITH THE SPRING FINANCE WATER AND MAKE THIS REQUEST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- THERE ARE CURRENTLY- ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY EIGHT CAN'T DESIGNATE A CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS FROM OUR OFFICE THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY ASPECTS ON ALL PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY THE UC'S- SO ANECDOTALLY IN THIS GROUP- THAT IS FOR DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS FOR. ALL OF BERKELEY- TO FOR ALL OF UCLA AND TO FOR UCSF AND UCSF MED CENTER- IT. NOT NEARLY ENOUGH- THERE THERE'S A DISPARITY IN REGARDS TO THE WORKLOAD OR DISPLAY IT'S A DISPROPORTIONATE WORKLOAD COMPARED TO THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE ON SITE- WE ARE ALSO UNAWARE SINCE THESE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL'S REPORT TO THE SPECIFIC UNIVERSITIES WE ARE UNAWARE AS TO WHAT OTHER DUTIES HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THESE PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR UC CHAIN OF COMMAND- SO AGAIN MORE CONCERNS ABOUT THE- LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THEN. OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN BE DIRECTED THROUGH THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND ANNUALLY WE DO RESERVE RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE- THE OFFICE OF THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF- INSPECTIONS WHETHER IT'S- CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TITLE NINETEEN OR TITLE TWENTY FOUR INSPECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED- GOOD STEWARDSHIP WOULD DICTATE THAT WE- THAT THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL WOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW THAT LIST AND FOLLOW UP- TO BE SURE THAT THOSE. AT JUST SPOT INSPECTIONS NOT DUPLICATIVE SERVICES BUT SPOT INSPECTIONS THAT ARE AUTHORITY IS BEING- CONDUCTED APPROPRIATELY- YOU FOR EVERYTHING FROM CODE COMPLIANCE TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OR- FOLLOWING UP ON DEFICIENCY NOTICES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED WHETHER THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED- MUCH LIKE ANY DELEGATION WHETHER IT'S THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE DELEGATING- ARE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HIMSELF DELEGATING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU- ON THIS ISSUE- OR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION WHICH WE USE H. CHI USED TO BE OCCUPIED- WHO HOLDS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DELEGATES TO THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS- TO MONITOR THEIR CONSTRUCTION RENOVATIONS AND SAFETY AT HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING. FACILITIES THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY IS THE STATE FARM MARSHALL OR- THE DIRECTOR H. CHI IT'S OKAY TO BE WRONG IT'S NOT OKAY TO STAY WRONG SO THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO RESET THIS IMHO. WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT AND- REALLY GETTING HAVING STAFF TO GET TO THOSE CAMPUSES MAKE THOSE CMPUS RELATIONSHIPS AND BE ABLE TO- HAVE THAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE- PROBLEMS OR ISSUES TOGETHER INSTEAD OF IN THOSE SILOS THAT THAT ARE ARE FREQUENTLY AND ARE CURRENTLY CREATED- AGAIN THIS ISN'T A DUPLICATE OF PROGRAM BUT AN OVERSIGHT PROGRAM THAT IS NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR AUTHORITY- OF THAT HAS BEEN DELEGATED TO THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S. UNDERSTAND HELEN AND THE ISSUES THAT SHE'S WRITTEN ON- BUT- AT THIS POINT THERE'S SO MANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES- THAT WE REALLY REALLY- ARE REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT- AND OVERTURNING THE. TO PUSH THIS OUT FOR MAYBE ANOTHER B. C. P. SEASON. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION- WHEN WE TURNED OUT TO LA- FOR. THEIR PERSPECTIVE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAILING CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY- SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THE PROPOSAL- BASICALLY WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE FIRE MARSHALL HAD ADEQUATELY SUBSTANTIATED THE JUSTIFICATION AT THIS POINT- AND THERE ARE A COUPLE REASONS- ONE WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE GOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WHEN WE WERE- DOING A REVIEW TO ADEQUATELY JUSTIFY- REALLY THAT YOU. SEE HASN'T BEEN- CONDUCTING SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT- A BUILDING STANDARDS IN THEIR FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY AS WAS MENTIONED AND THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR YOU'RE GETTING IS THAT YOU SEE IT BASICALLY HAD THIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY FOR SOMETIME SINCE EVER SINCE ROUGHLY NINETEEN NINETY FOUR- SO WE DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT. THEY WERE ADEQUATELY OVERSEEING THAT THE- THOSE FACILITIES THEMSELVES I'M OR WHETHER. IN THE- RIGHT SO MAYBE THE POPULAR DAY HERE THE CAPITAL. OR WHAT THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH A NEW UNIT WITH AND THE FIRE MARSHAL OR WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE- THESE CONCERNS SHOULD THEY BE- SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY HAVE MERIT ON THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO NOTE IS THAT- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND- CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU SEE THEY RAISED SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS WARRANTED. ON US THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT- THAT THEY WEREN'T THEY WEREN'T WHERE THIS PROPOSAL IS COMING FORWARD AND THEY DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS SO AGAIN- YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING A PROPOSAL AND THEN SHOULD THE ADMINISTRATION FEEL LIKE THIS IS YOU KNOW REALLY A CRITICAL ISSUE COME BACK IN JANUARY THAT'LL GIVE EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. YEAH APRIL IT'S JUST SUCH A- COMPRESSED A PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE LEGISLATORS LATE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS- TALK TO YOU SEE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THIS ISSUE AND SO- OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS IS CONSIDERED IN JANUARY IT'LL GIVE US MORE TIME FOR THE FIRE MARSHAL TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IT WILL GIVE SOME MORE TIME FOR SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU SEE- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE AND WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION. THE HAPPY TO TAKE. THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STEVEN BANDS WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE THANK YOU STRUCTURE- YES WILL REITERATE THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT REDUNDANCY- THE AT THE UC DOES IT CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS WILL CONTINUE TO DO PLAN REVIEW THE CONTINUE TO CONSTRUCTION SECTION THE CONTINUED TO THEIR BUILDING INSPECTIONS THIS IS ABOUT HAVING APPROPRIATE AND PRUDENT INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE OVERIGHT OTHERS THOUGHT IT'S BEEN DELEGATED- I THINK GIVEN THE- PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS. THAT ARE AT STAKE THAT HAVING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT IS IMPORTANT- THANK AS CHIEF COLLINS POINTED OUT. YOU EAT CAN'T GO THROUGH NECESSARILY INTO A LAUNDRY LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG EVERY CAMPUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE THERE AND YOU FIND OUT THAT'S WHAT OVERSIGHT IS REALLY ABOUT. I THINK IT'S JUST BECAUSE WHEN IT OUT AS THEY BECAME AWARE THAT I NEED TO GO INTO SOME MORE FINDING OUT IS NEEDED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS ABOUT. IS GETTING IN. SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT IN A FIRE AND PANIC SAFETY CODE COMPLIANCE IS HAPPENING IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE- THE STUDENTS AND STAFF AND FACULTY. THAT IS BETTER ON THE CAMPUSES. WE FEEL THAT THE YOU KNOW A PROPOSAL DOESN'T PLACE AN UNDUE UNDUE BURDEN ON ANY CAMPUS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE- POTENTIAL PROPORTIONAL IMPACT IS TO ANYONE CAMPUS IT SEEMS RELATIVELY MODERATE. MODEST AND I ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE STATE FARM MARSHALL'S OFFICE BILLS AN HOURLY RATE AND SO ANY CAMPUS THAT'S IN GOOD WORKING ORDER IN GOOD SHAPE IS NOT GOING TO GET BILL VERY MUCH YOU KNOW THE BUILDING WILL ONLY REALLY HAPPEN. IF THERE'S ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED- SO WITH WE FEEL THIS PROPOSAL IS MODEST AND IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND IT HELPS HIM- FILL A GAP IN SOME IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS AN INTERESTING JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE WE HAVE THE- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WHICH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY- PROTECTED IN MANY WAYS AS AN INDEPENDENT. TO AGENCY AN INDEPENDENT- ENTITY IN THE STATE- AND YET THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IS. CHARGED WITH. OVERSEEING THESE ASPECTS OF SAFETY ON CAMPUS WHY WHY WOULD WE NOT EXPECT. THE UC. TWO A COVER THE COST OF THE- BOTTOM. OF THAT OVERSIGHT INSPECTION. THE UC WOULD COVER THE COSTS OF THE DIVISION OF- FIRE LIFE SAFETY WAS NOT STATE FARM MARSHALL IS FUNDED ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS. SO THEY WITH THE CAMPUSES WOULD YOU SEE WOULD BE BILLED AND REIMBURSED. AFTER THE THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS- WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE BY THE UNIVERSITY CORRECT. I SEE. OKAY- TUCHET COLLINS- MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ALEJO'S- STATED CONCERNS- AND- IT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS- AND MAYBE TO WORK THE CITY REMARKS ALSO YOU IDENTIFIED I THINK EIGHT INDIVIDUALS FOR THEM AT- AT CAL- A TO A C. L. A. AND THEN. TO AT THE REST OF THE CAMPUS- MAYBE WAS UCSF AND WHEN OTHER CAMPUS WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE OTHER CAMPUSES- IF YOU'VE GOT NOT YOU BUT IF THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE- INSPECTORS OUT AT CAL. DECIDES THAT CAMPUS ISN'T THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM UCLA AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO THEIR- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AN IMBALANCE AND THAT THE- COVERAGE WE WOULD NEED DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW- YES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- AS WE HAD DISCUSSED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IN REGARDS TO- THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPELLER THIS REQUEST AND- DISCUSS WITH THEM THOSE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR THE DISPARITY IN OF NUMBER OF- DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS. AT THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES NOW IT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AGAIN THAT THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS WORK FOR THE SPECIFIC FACILITY SO THAT EACH EACH CAMPUS CAN HIRE AS MANY OR AS FEW AS THEY CHOOSE- THERE IS NOT A MINIMUM NUMBER. MAY I INTERRUPT AND JUST GAS THAT THAT IS THROUGH AUTHORITY THAT IS DELEGATED FROM THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THE- WELL AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. I HATE DOING THIS WITHOUT IT IN FRONT OF ME- I BELIEVE IT ALLOWS US TO DELEGATE- A DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL TO THE FACILITY. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM. AND SOMEHOW ALONG THE WAY IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A BREAK DOWN AND SORT OF THE FLOW OF INFORMATION AND OVERSIGHT AND COMMUNICATION AND PERHAPS ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN- THE UC AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL THAT'S CORRECT- WE DID START HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- TO TRY TO- THEY HAVE TAKEN ON THE ROLE- TO TRY TO ADMINISTER THAT INFORMATION FROM EACH OF THE CAMPUSES IN ONE PLACE. BUT THE DESIGNATION IS SPECIFIC TO THOSE CAMPUSES. IS THERE A- I I'M- AWARE OF- A SHORTAGE OF- FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS IN THE STATE IS MY SON'S A FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDIC AND HE REPORTS AND MAKE. BUT BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE PARTLY BECAUSE OF- OF RETIREMENTS IS THAT PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE ALSO THAT- RETIREMENT CIRQUE CELEBRATING. AS THEY ARE IN MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND- POSITIONS ARE NOT BEING FILLED THIS QUICKLY THAT KIND OF THING. YES THAT IS THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT WE HAVE AND IT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT LED US HERE WAS- THROUGH ATTRITION AT BOTH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AS WELL AS AT THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL UP ALL THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAD. JUST SORT OF- DEVOLVED- AWAY AND WHICH YOU KNOW SOMEBODY NEW COMES IN AND EVERYONE IS BUSY- SO THE TIME TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS I THINK ARE HARDER- I THINK WE'RE COMING OUT OF THAT NOW- AS WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER IN PERSON. THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE INTEREST FOR PEOPLE TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY SEE NEW PEOPLE AND DEVELOP THOSE CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE DONE- EIGHT THERE ARE DEFINITE BENEFITS TO THIS PROGRAM. BY IT THERE THERE IS I'M NOT TRYING I'M NOT HERE TRYING TO SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS INEFFECTIVE OR- OR DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW. AND WHERE THAT AUTHORITY IT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT PLACES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW PEOPLE SEND THEIR CHILDREN AND- THE- THOSE CAMPUSES ARE JUST SUCH HUBS OF ACTIVITY AND INFORMATION AND- GATHERINGS AND EDUCATION THAT IT WOULD JUST BE REALLY GREAT TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED APPROPRIATELY SO- ARE YOU GIVING THOUGHT TO- AT- AFTER YOU- TRANSITION TO THESE NEW POSITIONS AND- BEGIN TO LEARN. MORE ABOUT THE- HOW THE PROGRAM IS WORKING WHAT'S GOING ON YOU GIVING THOUGHT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RESTRUCTURING- THE PROGRAM HOW LONG HOW LONG IS THIS- DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY BEEN AND- IT CAME IN IN. WAS IT A BILL 202-120-0022 THOUSAND AND TEN POINT FORMALLY OKAY SO PRIOR TO THAT REJECTED YEAH IT AND THERE HAD BEEN THE ELLIE- IS CORRECT THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN INFORMAL- DELEGATION AT THAT TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE FIRE MARSHAL SAID WE SHOULD PROBABLY FROM THIS THING UP AND DID IT FORMALLY. THROUGH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE- SO EAT YEAH IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NICE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY YOU. REALLY LOOK AT THESE DELEGATIONS AND HOW WE DO THEM- COMING UP THE CS TO DELEGATE THAT RESPONSIBILITY WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO- WE'VE STARTED AN AMMO YOU WITH THEM IT IS STRUCTURED VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE THAN THE UC AMONG YOU- AND- SO RESTRUCTURING IS DEFINITELY- IN OUR THOUGHT PROCESS. ON HOW TO MAKE THIS BETTER AND HOW TO MAKE IT MORE STREAMLINED. GROUP ONE THANK YOU AND ASK A COUPLE OF THEM SO YOU HAVE A CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL IN THE NEW HAVE CAL FIRE MARSHAL CHECKING ON THE CAMPUS. MARSHALL WHAT IS THE OVERLAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS AND- YOUR CHECK IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT THEY'RE NOT CHECKING. WELL IT WOULD BE MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT IS THE THOUGHT PROCESS- REVIEWING THEIR INSPECTIONS MAY BE GOING TO A BUILDING THAT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND TAKING A LOOK TO BE SURE THAT THAT THINGS WEREN'T WEREN'T MESSED- THERE IS SO. CONSTRUCTION INSPECTIONS IS SO INTRICATE THAT- IF YOU IF YOU MISS ONE- IF YOU PUT A FIRE DAMPER INSTEAD OF A SMOKE FIRE DAMPER WHICH IS REQUIRED BY STATE REGULATIONS THAT COULD END UP COSTING QUITE A BIT DOWN THE ROAD SO- TRYING TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD- OR THAT THE FACILITY IS AND SPENDING MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO- IS. IS NEVER SHOULD NEVER BE PAINFUL- FINDING A MISTAKE EARLIER THAN LATER IS OFTEN THIS IS FOR DENNIS NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT. WOULD BE THROUGHOUT TO- GO THROUGH AND BE SURE EVEN THAT- A LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPENS ON CAMPUSES IS YOU HAVE ONE INSTRUCTOR THAT WANTS TO DO ONE THING. THEY LEAVE THE NEXT'S INSTRUCTOR COMES IN- PROFESSOR COMES IN AND THEY WANT TO REARRANGE- ALL ROOM AND MAYBE THEY WANT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN- EQUIPMENT THAT COMES IN WELL MAYBE IT BLOCKS AN EXIT. SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE REVIEWED TO BE SURE THAT YOU ARE MAINTAINING THAT EXITING FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S USING THAT FACILITY. SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF SPOT CHECKS THAT ARE DONE THERE ARE- INSPECTIONS THAT ARE DONE ON ALL THE HIGH RISES- I WAS REVIEWING SOME OF THEM YESTERDAY THERE ARE. DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE NOTED BY THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS AND SO IN. IN MY VIEW OF THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD BE- SOMEONE FROM OUR OFFICE GOING BACK TO BE SURE THAT THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE ADDRESSED AND ARE BEING IGNORED THEN- WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT ENFORCEMENT ASPECT. THAT POTENTIALLY MAY NOT BE A COMFORTABLE PLACE FIRST TO HIM FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO ENFORCE AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER. WHO SAY THAT CHECKS OUT NOW. THE CARD THREE POINT TWO MILLION BECAUSE LAST YEAR DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE REQUEST WAS- HURT- DOLLAR WISE AND HOW MUCH WAS REIMBURSED. SO IS IT BEEN TEN YEARS I THINK WAS AN OUTLOOK OUT HERE. BUT WE- WE HAVEN'T STARTED THIS PROGRAM YET. THIS OVERSIGHT PROGRAM IS THAT WHICH I MAY BE WAS THAT TODAY OKAY SO YOUIT'LL BE OFFERING NO NOTHING SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS STARTED THERE'S NOT BEEN NO OVERSIGHT AND- SO THEY'VE DONE SOME SOME REDIRECTION OF STAFF IS THE- IN. THE CHIEF MENTIONED A PARTICULAR CAMPUS THAT YOU KNOW HAD THERE DID DOESN'T CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL. LEAVE ASIDE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON HOW MANY HOURS WERE SPENT AT THAT CAMPUS YOU KNOW I DIDN'T THINK TO BRING THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING TO BRING BUT I DIDN'T I CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK TO YOU I WAS JUST SICK AND I'M- I'M JUST TRYING TO CHECK FOR. CALIFORNIA LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING AND SO ON TO WORK BUT CHECKS AND BALANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CHECKS AND BALANCES AND WE'RE JUST NOT. WE PAT EACH OTHER ON THE BACK GOING THROUGH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE EVER LOSES HER LIFE AND ONE OF THESE FIRES AND THAT'S THE CRITICAL PART ABOUT THIS. CORRECT OKAY ABSOLUTE. WELL SO I THINK THE ONLY- ADDITIONAL COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT THAT- WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T DUPLICATING WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IT IS MORE IN THE NATURE OF OVERSEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE- ON THE CAMPUSES UNDERSTANDING. THAT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME SIGNIFICANT GRAY AREA THERE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE OF THE CHIMNEY. THING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- THAT'S GOING TO BE INSPECTED PRESUMABLY BY THE ON CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL AND THEN IT MAY BE. YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A HUNDRED THINGS LIKE THAT THAT AND THE OVERSIGHT IS ONLY GOING TO PROBABLY LOOK AT A SUBSET OF THOSE THINGS BUT IT MIGHT CROSS OVER SO MIGHT GET A DOUBLE CHECK. BUT. I DON'T THINK WE NEED AND MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT OR WRONG ON THIS I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED- TWO IDENTICAL LAYERS OF FIRE MARSHALS- AT EAST EAST CAMPUS THE THING THAT- IT'S BEEN DETERMINED TO BE MISSING. IS THE- CONSISTENT OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE- STATE FARM MARSHAL'S OFFICE CORRECT SO IF. IF WE WANTED TO BE DUPLICATIVE THERE WOULD BE WAY MORE THAN TWELVE. POSITIONS ASKED IN THIS- SAYS LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT WITH EIGHT CAMPUSES THEY'RE DOING IT WITH A TOTAL OF TWENTY EIGHT STATEWIDE OKAY OKAY I MISSED THAT. WHO IS THAT THAT. THAT THAT BRINGS ME A LOT MORE COMFORT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THERE IT SOUNDED LIKE- WHAT I WAS HEARING WAS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SHORTFALL OF- INDIVIDUALS- OKAY BRINGS US TO CLOSE ON THIS ITEM AND THAT IS THE LAST- ITEM ON OUR AGENDA FOR DISCUSSION. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS ON THE NON DISCUSSION ITEMS- THIS DEBATE HERE BUT MAN I DON'T HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON- DISCUSSION ITEMS SO- WILL DISPENSE WITH THAT- PART OF OUR AGENDA AND MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT- AND AS I SAID EARLIER EVERYONE WILL HAVE- UP TO ONE MINUTE TO SPEAK. WE'LL START WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM AND THEN OPEN THE PHONE LINES- FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING AND IF YOU WANT TO CALL IN THE NUMBERS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SEVEN. AND WILL BEGIN NOW WITH PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM WELCOME. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING- MICROBES HERE ON BEHALF OF THE GLASS PACKAGING USED TO WHICH IS THE- TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR GLASS CONTAINER MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE NATION FOR THAT MATTER- ON THE ON THE GOVERNOR'S- BOTTLE BILL PROPOSAL ON. WE SUPPORT WE WERE SUPPORTIVE AND ENCOURAGED% BY THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING- WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND CARRY CYCLE ON ON. THE OTHER DETAILS WITH WE THINK THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE PROBABLY REALLOCATED TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THAT BY BACK INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONSUMER CONVENIENCE- WE OPPOSE THE DOUBLE REDEMPTION IDEA- WE THINK THERE ARE SOME PRACTICAL AND SOME PRACTICAL CONCERNS AND THINGS THAT- YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- AND MISTERS- SOMEONE SMITH BROUGHT UP ON. ON THE RV ENDS THAT WE THINK THE REVERSE VENDING MACHINES WILL. SOUND GREAT BUT YOU YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A RECYCLING- CENTER BACKING THEM THAT ARE SUPPORTING THEM OTHERWISE IT JUST WON'T WORK. AND WE THINK THE MOBILE RECYCLING SOUNDS PROMISING BUT I THINK IT AT THE L. A. O. NOTED- THAT THE PILOTS HAVEN'T PROVEN THEMSELVES YET AND WE IT SO IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT SHOWN- STRUCK SHOWN- ABILITY TO WORK. BUT THE BAG DROPS- THE BACKDROP PROGRAMS HAVE WORKED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND WE THINK THOSE ARE THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT. AND ON THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT. I'M AS IT APPLIES THE GLASS SPECIFICALLY WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS ON THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT HOW IT- HOW HOW IT WOULD BE USED IN IN PRACTICE AND- WE WILL WANT TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T. JUST CONTINUE TO REWARD POOR QUALITY- COLLECTION AND MOVEMENT FROM THE MURPH AND WITH THEIR THEIR STIR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE HERE WE WANT. TO WORK WITH YOU ON IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KYLE JONES WITH COMMUNITY Y. CENTER AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT- THE SEVEN NEW POSITIONS FOR SIGMA AT THE WATER BOARD. WHICH IS REYES THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT SEVEN POSITIONS WILL BE ENOUGH THE BOARD NOTED THAT TWELVE BASES ARE GOING. POTENTIALLY A PROBATIONARY STATUS THAT INCLUDES THIRTY FOUR PLANTS. AND SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH RESOURCES IN PLACE TO GET THOSE- MOVED QUICKLY AND AT FOR THAT REASON WE ALSO BELIEVE THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS APPROPRIATE SINCE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION WAS AFFORDED. TO LOCAL AGENCIES AS THEY DEVELOP THOSE PLANS- THE FINANCE LETTER NOT SET UP TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED BESTING WELLS COULD GO TRY THIS YEAR ALONE AND IF WE HAVE ANOTHER YEAR OF DROUGHT. THAT COULD GET EVEN WORSE AND SO WE HOPE THESE PLANS WILL BE IN PLACE NEXT YEAR SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT DRINKING WATER MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND THE LIKE. ARE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ANTHONY MILLION N BEHALF OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION IN CALIFORNIA IN THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION. I WE WANT TO START BY THANKING THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. FOR PRACTICALLY ENGAGING PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK. TO ASSIST THE CONTAINER RECYCLING BEVERAGE PROGRAM- IN THE PROPOSED PCP. HOWEVER IS CURRENTLY PROPOSE THAT WE BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ONE TIME SPENDING OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT- FOR LIMITED TAKE BACK A BEVERAGE CONTAINERS- WE BELIEVE THAT RE PRIORITIZING THINGS FUNDS- TO INVEST IN THE EXISTING TAKE BACK CENTERS THE NEW CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE PROPOSAL. NEW PROCESSORS AND ADDITIONAL METHODS FOR COLLECTION- ARE BETTER INVESTMENTS AND WILL HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON THE RECYCLING SYSTEM- WE KNOW THAT THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS IN THE PAST. I'VE HELP RICK- INCREASE THE STATE'S RECYCLING RATE. PROVIDE CLEAN MATERIALS TO MEET THE NEW MANDATE. FOR MANDATORY. CONTENT AND THEN ALSO PROVIDE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WILL STRENGTHEN THAT. WHICH IS A PART OF THE PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE SOME POLICY CHANGE THAT WE BELIEVE. WOULD GO HAND IN HAND. WITH THE B. C. P. TO HELP THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL TO SHARE THE SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. A FEW OF THOSE ARE FLEXIBLE STAFFING HOURS. HOURSOF OPERATION ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS. EDUCATION ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND- CISTICOLIDAE XIN METHOD. FOR MATERIALS WHEN USING THE AUTOMATED RECYCLING MACHINES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH YOU GUYS IS THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO THOROUGH. I EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM- WELL TRAINED INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOURSELF. ALSO NOTE. GREG HER ON BEHALF OF THE CAN MANUFACTURERS INSTITUTE- REPRESENTING THE MAKERS OF THE MOST RECYCLED AND RECYCLABLE CONTAINER AVAILABLE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROUGHT FORTH A PROPOSAL- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CRV AND HAVE ENCOURAGE OTHER STATES TO ADOPT SIMILAR PROGRAMS TO INCREASE THE RECYCLING RATE NATIONWIDE BUT I'D LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH SOME OF THOSE THAT ANTHONY JUST MADE WE ACTUALLY WE DO HAVE SOME VERY. SIMILAR CONCERNS THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL FUNDAMENTALLY EACH PROPOSAL NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED AGAINST ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE CONSUMER CONVENIENCE. AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDEMPTION AND IMPROVE MATERIAL QUALITY WERE STARVING FOR GETTING MATERIAL BACK RIGHT NOW IN THE INDUSTRY. THE PANDEMIC PRETTY UNIQUE SITUATION THE BUILT UP THE RESERVE BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE SPEND THAT RESERVE TIM MAKE LASTING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM THAT INCREASES OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS. SO WE APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING THE ITEM OPEN SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT APARTMENT AND FIND SOME FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT WILL REALLY IMPROVE THE SYSTEM FOR CONSUMERS. AND NOT PUT MONEY OUT JUST IN A ONE TIME THING WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BURST ON CAP KEY MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF STRATEGIC MATERIALS THE LARGEST CLASS PROCESSOR IN THE STATE NATION. ARE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION COMING FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL TO UTILIZE SOME OF THESE FUNDS ARE FOR INCREASING RECYCLING. HOW WE SHARE THE COMMENTS OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AROUND WANTING TO FOCUS SOME OF THE SPENDING. ON A RECYCLING CENTERS ARE OVER AND ABOVE SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS I PARTICULARLY FOR GLASS. I SOME OF THE OPTIONS TO PRESENT CHALLENGES ARE WHILE WE UNDERSTAND OUR VIA MACHINES MAY BE WORKABLE FOR SOME OTHER MATERIAL TYPES. FIVE SMI DOES HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT. THE FACT THAT MANY OF THOSE MATURE AT THOSE EQUIPMENT. I DO CRUSH THAT GLASS OUT WHICH RESULTS IN YIELD LOSS OF SOME OF THE FEINSTEIN SO. THAT WHILE WE STRONGLY YOU KNOW SUPPORT RECYCLING THAT IS A CONCERN JUST IN TERMS OF RELIANCE ON RPM'S FOR GLASS SPECIFICALLY. HOW WE ALSO SUPPORT THE COMMENTS MADE ABOUT HELPING TO ENSURE. A BETTER QUALITY CERTAINLY- STRATEGIC MATERIALS IS A KEY- YOU KNOW ENTITY AND IN DOING THAT HELPING TO CLEAN AND COLOR SORT THAT CLASS- FOR RE PURPOSING INTO NEW EYEGLASS PACKAGING. AND OVERALL ALLOW WE WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME ADDITIONAL REFORMS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM. A RECYCLING REDEMPTION AND I PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO CLASS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INCLUDING WINE AND SPIRITS. UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR SB TEN THIRTEEN THOSE ARE CONVENIENT RECYCLING CENTER OPTIONS ARE GOING TO BE MISSION CRITICAL TO ENSURE A COLLECTION HAPPENED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN LOUIS BROWN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO LINE- SOME OF OUR- COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF. PREVIOUS SPEAKERS DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION COMING FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSALS THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW THE BOTTLE BILL OTHER RESERVISTS JUST DEFINITELY TOO LARGE AND- PEOPLE CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE THAT MONEY BACK. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT MONEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THOSE UNSERVED AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE CONSUMERS NOW HAVE LITTLE TO NO OPPORTUNITY FOR RECYCLING OTHER THAN POTENTIALLY TAKING IT BACK INTO OUR STORES. WHICH WE BELIEVE IS POLICY THAT NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED- IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THOSE SITES- WILL ONLY HAPPEN WITH CHANGES IN POLICY LIKE MR MEDINA SPOKE ABOUT THEIR NEEDS TO BE GREATER FLEXIBILITY WE NEED TO TAKE INTO THE OPERATING. A CIRCUMSTANCES OF THOSE SITES AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT BUSINESS VENTURE THESE DAYS. AND SO WE LIKE TO SEE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOCUSED IN THOSE AREAS AND THEY GIVE REGION'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE CHOICES. HOW WHAT IS BEST SUITED FOR THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THOSE COMMUNITIES THOSE COUNTIES NOT JUST CREATE SILOS OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR RBM TO CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR BAG DROP. WE NEED TO BE. COGNIZANT OF THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED ALLOW THE TECHNOLOGY TO GO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE OUR RECYCLING RATES. LET'S NOT LOSE THE FACT THAT WE'RE STILL SINCE 70% RECYCLING RATE HOW NOT WITHSTANDING EVERYTHING WE'VE GONE THROUGH. SO WE KNOW THAT IF WE JUST START TO FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS THAT ARE UNSERVED WE CAN QUICKLY GET THAT RECYCLING RATE UP. AND WILL SEE MAJOR BENEFITS IN OUR PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR READ ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN SUPPORT OF CHARICE I BECAUSE B. C. P. IN PARTICULAR BE BASED ON SOME OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE PILOT WORK. AND WE DO THINK THERE'S OF OVERLAP IN THE POLICIES THEY'RE SHOWING THEIR BCP WITH YOUR WORK ON FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR- WE WOULD SUGGEST TO FRIENDLY MA'AM IS THAT WE'RE NOT SURE ARE CAPTURED IN THE B. C. P. ONE IS AS THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE ARIENS AND MOBILE- PROGRAMS. THE QUESTION IS ARE THE LOCAL CORES WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE B. C. P. ARE THEY ABLE TO HELP STAFF THOSE ACTIVITIES WE DO THINK THERE WILL NEED TO BE SOME LOCAL CORE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THOSE MOBILE PROGRAMS ANY ARIANS AND SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE DEPLOYED- SECONDLY I GUESS WE WOULD SAY THAT THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME TIME. BEFORE THESE VARIOUS MOBILE PROGRAMS ARE SET UP. IN THAT TIME IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO. INCREASE SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR LOCAL COURSE D. INCREASED THEIR BOTTLE AND RECYCLING PROGRAMS. IN THE INTERVENING TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST TO COLLECT. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THOSE THAT. ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES TO BE OUR ON THE GROUND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT APPEARS TO CONCLUDE THE- PUBLIC COMMENTS FROM THOSE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM OPERATOR ARE YOU OUT THERE AND READY FOR US. YES WE ARE IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS FROM THE PHONE LINE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE WILL OPEN LINE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE. GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS EMILY PAPPAS ON BEHALF ENABLE PAPPAS AND ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT MOLTEN CORES WE WITH BOTH OF COURSE BELIEVE THAT THE CLEAN RECYCLED FEEDSTOCK ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF CITADEL PACKAGING SOLUTIONS AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO INVESTING AND SUCH RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THANKS TO THEM FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD- IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS LOST MORE THAN 50% OF ITS RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE MUST MUST MUCH OF IT- WITH THE TAKE BACK MECHANISM IS MOST CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS. THROUGH WHICH CONTAINERS ARE SUCCESSFULLY SORTED AND BREAKAGE EXAMINATION OF GLASS WITH MOSTLY AVOIDED SO WITH THAT WE SUPPORT BUDGET INVESTMENTS IN THE EXPANSION OF CLING COLLECTION PROPHECIES INCLUDING ONE PROPHECIES THAT CREATES A NUMBER OF CONSUMER CONVENIENT TAKE BACK CENTERS THAT INCREASE SUPPLY AND REDUCE BREAKAGE AND CONTAMINATION. TO EFFORTS TO INCENTIVIZE OR COMPEL MORE RESPONSIBLE SORTING THAT RESULT IN CLEAN SHEETS STOCK AND THREE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT COMPENSATE FOR THE HIGH COST OF GLASS REMANUFACTURING STORE HOPE IS INVESTMENTS LIKE THOSE ABOVE THEY WILL INCREASE THE RECYCLE GLASS SUPPLY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SECURING THE RECYCLE GLASS SUPPLY NEEDED FOR BEER AND OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE ON OUR MUTUAL SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING BALLS.
