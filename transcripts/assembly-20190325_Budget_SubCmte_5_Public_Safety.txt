WELCOME TO THE HEARING GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL ON MONDAY. MAKING IT A REGULAR DATE. OKAY WILL BEGIN. MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND THE NUMBER STONE. NAME IS LOT COMPUTER WHICH ON THE BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND I HAVE WITH ME -- MISTER MIKE RODDY -- COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE SAN DIEGO COURT. WE HEAR RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED IN THE AGENDA REGARDING THE FIRST ISSUE ON THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THIS PAST YEAR. IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS HELP IN AN IMPROVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO OUT OUR OUR COURT SYSTEM. WITH THAT SAID -- SORT OF RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED. THE FIRST QUESTION WAS REGARDING THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT THE COUNCIL USED ON THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION -- FIRST A THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS USED TO BRING UP -- OUR SMALLEST COURTS TO THEIR FUNDING NEED IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THERE -- BUT 800-800-1000 -- TO HELP SOME SECURITY COSTS THAT ARE HEADING COURTS. AND THEN THE THE BALANCE OF SEVENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE REMAINING COURTS -- ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS. AND THE COUNCIL THAT ACTS TO SEPARATELY ALLOCATE TEN MILLION OF THE SEVENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF COURT REPORTER FOR A REFORM COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW. CONSISTENT WITH THE BUDGET LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT -- TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE THE AGENDA DOES CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE COURTS THAT RECEIVE THE FUNDS -- WE WORK WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THE DOLLARS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. AND IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES OF COURT REPORTER FUNDS TO DATE -- WE DON'T HAVE SINCE WERE MADE HERE IN THE FISCAL YEAR DON'T HAVE EXPENDITURE DATA -- IN TERMS OF WHERE COURTS ARE IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES WHO DO HAVE SOME SORT OF WITH PROVIDING YOU SEE IN THE AGENDA SOME -- ANTICIPATED HOPEFUL OUTCOMES AND PLANS -- FOR THE EXPENDITURE IF YOU CALL LAST YEAR -- DOCTOR WHERE WILL BE PROVIDED ON WHAT WERE CALLED BUDGET SNAPSHOTS EACH COURT DID IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD BE SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON IN ANTICIPATION OF AN INVESTMENT WE PROVIDED YOU THAT AS A SORT OF A YOU KNOW A LOOK BACK AS TO WHAT WAS DONE -- AS FAR SOME OUTCOMES WITHOUT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION IN TERMS OF EXPANDING ACCESS -- INCREASING STAFFING WE HIRING -- EMPLOYEE SALARIES CASE MANAGEMENT EXTENDING SERVICE DAYS NOW -- BUT NOT SO I THINK THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS THERE AND COURTS REALLY USING THOSE RESOURCES. TO HELP BRING ABOUT AN AFFECTIONATE SOME GOOD CHANGE FOR THE FOR THE BRANCH WITH THANK YOU FOR THAT. SURE HAD RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS AND HAVE AN AGAIN. ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- OR CORPORATE FINANCE. THE REQUESTED MRS STONE. JUST. SINCE YOU HANDED OUT THIS BINDER WHICH IS PRETTY INTERESTING I WAS ONLY IF I CAN GET THAT ELECTRONICALLY ABSOLUTELY AND IF WE COULD. IF THIS IS SOMETHING THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE AND IF YOU I I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY AS WE STRUGGLE WITH COURTS FUNDING. BECAUSE THIS REALLY LETS US KNOW THE TRIAL COURT LEVEL. CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING AS WELL AS THEIR PRIORITIES FOR REINVESTMENT SO IF WE COULD GET THIS FOR EARLY RIDERS IS THE AS A PART OF THAT. BUDGET PROCESS I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU COLLECT THIS RECORDED THIS WAS A IN THIS YEAR. IF I MAY UM DOCTOR AGAINST ONLY -- WE DID IT SORT OF UNIQUELY FOR THIS LAST BUDGET ADVOCACY GIVEN THAT TYPE IN NATURE OF THERE WAS A DISCRETIONARY FUNDING WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE. TO THE LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION WHAT WERE THE SORT OF SPECIFIC GOALS -- SO WE TEND TO TAILOR OUR ADVOCACY BASED ON WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET AND SO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF OF PRESENTATION SO IT. AGAIN WE HADN'T SORT OF TAILOR OUR INFORMATION BUT WE ARE GATHERING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THE COUNCIL FROM ALL OF THE COURTS AS TO WHAT THEY DID. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE -- SOMETHING WE SHARED WITH THE STAFF AND WE CAN DEFINITELY PASS IT ON TO YOU OKAY -- AS WE GO GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY TALK WHICH IS A COUNSEL S WE GO THROUGH BUDGET STUFF BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE'RE HEARING FROM TRIAL COURTS INDEED BOTH OURS AND ACROSS THE STATE. IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT IS A TRIAL COURTS ARE WANTING TO DO AND THEN AS WE TALK TO YOU THAT THAT DOES HELP US. KIND OF KEEP TRACK OF WHERE THINGS ARE INDEED SO WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE. I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING AND I HOPE WE CAN THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL. IS HELPFUL UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS THIS BOOKLET THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN IS THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THEY FACE IT WAS. AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH ADDITIONAL DOLLARS COMING IN THIS YEAR IT WAS IT WAS THE REPRESENTATION OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OKAY BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THIS WAS LOOKING BACKWARDS AT THE MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO WE WANTED WITH THOSE IMPORTANT TO TO TO EXPLAIN TO WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO POSITIVELY WITH THE MONEY THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET -- PRISON WITH YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WILL. PROCESS BUT WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT HEADWAY TOWARDS MEETING THESE NEEDS THAT WERE PRESENTED HERE SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THE COUNCIL REQUIRED TO REPORT IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES. AND SO WE ARE GATHERING INFORMATION BACK FROM THE COURTS BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND PLANNING TO DO WITH THE MONEY. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH I DON'T HAVE ANY THAT ARE ANY OF COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. WILL EACH HAVE A MINUTE. TO IT WAS COMMON. HI -- NANCY TRAVEL WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA I HOPE THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEFENSE COUNSEL MIKEBELOW NIGHT SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRIAL COURT JUDGES -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS YEAR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS OFFICIALLY ASKING FOR TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL JUDGES WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THERE WERE FIFTY AUTHORIZED ONLY TWO OF THOSE FIFTY HAVE EVER BEEN FUNDED. AND SO DURING THE MANY YEARS OF BUDGET CUTS IT WAS VERY UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT ABLE TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS FOR JUDGES BUT NOW. THAT TWELVE YEARS HAVE PASSED AND WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR. ON WE THINK IT'S FAR PAST TIME TO FUND THOSE DESPERATELY NEEDED TRIAL COURT JUDGES VERTICALLY SINCE THE IDENTIFIED NEED. IS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN AND AS REPRESENTING LAWYERS WHO PRACTICE IN CIVIL COURTS WHETHER IT'S PERSONAL INJURY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ELDER ABUSE -- SEX DISCRIMINATION OUR CASES ALWAYS ARE FALLING TO THE LAST OF THE PACK -- AFTER CRIMINAL CASES WHICH OF COURSE HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PREFERENCE SO WE HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER. OF FINDING THOSE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE JUDGES THEIR SHARE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIKE BELOW AGAIN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL AND CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. AGAIN FROM THE DESIGN OF THE AGENDA WE WEREN'T SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WAS TO SPEAK TO THIS JUDGESHIP ISSUE -- BUT I WOULD SECOND WHAT -- IS TRAVEL WAS TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION. THE CIVIL FILING FEES WERE INCREASED. REPEATEDLY BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS ON THE COURTS ESPECIALLY -- CRIMINAL SPEEDY TRIAL REQUIREMENTS SERVICE TO CIVIL LITIGANTS ACTUALLY WENT DOWN SO HIGHER FEES LOWER SERVICE WE UNDERSTOOD IT BUT NOW WE'RE IN A NEW ERA -- WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING MOTIONS HER TRIAL DATE SET AND SO AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A JUDICIAL BRANCH FUNDING SORT OF WRIT LARGE AGAIN IT IS NOT A DISCRETIONARY FUNDING ISSUE. BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF JUDICIAL BRANCH FUNDING AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO OF FOR THIS FIRST TIME NOW THAT WERE PASSED THE RECESSION. TO FUND HALF OF THE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS. THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING HERE MY NAME IS SCOTT THOMAS I'M A COURT INVESTIGATOR WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I LIKE TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE SMALL GROUP OF EMPLOYEES THAT EVEN MANY COURT EMPLOYEES ARE UNAWARE OF COURT INVESTIGATORS DEAL WITH AT RISK -- PEOPLE WE DEAL WITH CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED ADULTS AND THE ELDERLY. UNLIKE CHILDREN DAHLE PROTECTIVE SERVICES. AND THE POLICE CANNOT REMOVE INDEPENDENT ADULT FROM A RISKY SITUATION IN THEIR HOME -- THEY DEPEND ON THE POINT OF CONSERVATIVES BY THE COURT TO LOOK AFTER THEIR WELFARE. CORDON BEST GATORS ARE TASKED WITH LOOKING AFTER THE CONSERVATIVES WERE MANDATED BY PROBATE CODE THE VISIT CONSERVATIVES CONSERVATORIES IN THEIR HOME EVERY TWO YEARS. I'M NOT AWARE OF A SINGLE COURT THAT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS MANDATE WE HAD CHALLENGES WITH THIS MANDATE DUE TO SHORTAGES OF PERSONNEL BEFORE TRIAL COURT FUNDING. AND WE ARE CONTINUING STRUGGLE TO MEET THESE DEMANDS. SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- IT CAN TAKE CENTER THIS SITUATION IT CONCERNS ME GREATLY LAST YEAR. WE HAD AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN -- DIE OF NEGLECT IN A CARE HOME. HE WAS FOUND ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR IN HIS OWN URINE -- VISITS OR SHOULD BE TAKING PLACE EVERY TWO YEARS ARE ROUTINELY BEING PUSHED OFF THE FOUR YEARS SIX YEARS -- THIS IS AN AT RISK POPULATION JUST CAN'T RISK THAT KIND OF TIME FRAME. SO I APPRECIATE ANY CONSIDERATION YOU CAN GIVE TO THE FUNDING THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT THE COURT INVESTIGATIONS. THANK YOU.

MY OWN SUPERVISOR MYSELF AND BASE THEIR ENTIRE DAY MANAGING THOSE CASELOADS MAKING SURE THEY GET TO THE JUDGES MAKING SURE THEY GET -- TO OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THE PERSON AS FAIR REPRESENTATION -- THIS LIMITS OUR TIME TO WORK ON MANY OTHER THINGS LIKE BEAUTICIANS FOR DISMISSAL WHICH WHEN SOMEONE IN THE COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO CHANGE THEIR LIFE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND HER PEOPLE MY NAME IS TERRENCE TRACY AND I'M ALSO A CLERK AT THE COUNTER ACOSTA SUPERIOR COURT WITH ASKED ME TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED IN COALITION WITH THE SEIU -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WAS -- I'M KIND OF THE NUMBERS GUY ON OUR TEAM. AND TOOK JUST TO I KNOW INFLATION IS GONE ON EVERYWHERE AND COST OF LIVING IS GONE OUT -- I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE BAY AREA WHERE I LIVE WHERE IT'S GONE UP THANK GOD YOU CAME THROUGH WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR FOR THE OF DISCRETIONARY FUNDS FOR SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET A YOU KNOW AND 4% OVER TO YOUR ANNA MARIE'S. WHICH ONCE WE GET TO THROUGH THOSE TWO YEARS WERE BACK AT 25% BEHIND COST OF LIVING. I'M JUST. THROWING THE NUMBERS OUT OF THERE AT YOU JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM WE'RE NOT GREEDY WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR MORE THAN WHAT WE NEED WE'RE LOOKING FOR JUST WHAT WE NEED -- TO SURVIVE MANY -- EMPLOYEES HAVE MOVED BACK WITH THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD APARTMENTS -- IN OUR COMMUNITY -- A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- YOU KNOW DECADE OR SO IS. DONE AWAY WITH THE RESERVE FUNDS -- BUT THE COURTS WERE ONLY ALLOWED AND BE ELIMINATED THAT THE COURTS CAN THEN DO. I'M ADDITIONAL BUSINESS WITH THEIR RESERVES AND ALSO. THAT FACT THAT. THE ME CHECK MY NOTES REAL QUICKLY -- THERE USED TO BE A A COST OF LIVING INCREASE LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET. THAT NO LONGER EXISTS FOR COURTS -- AND THAT WE USED TO GET FUNDING FOR A COLA THAT WE NO LONGER GET. I'M WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT REENACTED -- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTER ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK. THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE DIRECTIVE TO ALLOCATE MONEY FOR FAMILY LAW -- COURT REPORTERS AND THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED -- WAS VERY HELPFUL AND WE HOPE THAT THAT -- THAT THERE IT IS. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP AS TO WHERE THAT MONEY WAS SPENT KIND OF REALLY DRILL DOWN ON THAT HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL MONEY. LET ME ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS WE'RE FINDING AND SOME OF THE COURTS. IS THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT SAID THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT. ENCORE REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW I WAS KIND OF RED LOW BUT NARROWLY THESE WERE HER ON THE GROUND AND THAT IS TO SUPPLEMENT -- FOR FAMILY LAW CASES AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SOME QUARTERS KIND OF A SHIFTING AROUND THEY MAY. THEY MAY ADD COURT REPORTERS AND PAY FOR IT -- CORPORATE OF HIM ON PAY FOR OUT OF THE THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY. BUT THOSE COURT REPORTERS WERE IN HANDLING OTHER CASES SO THEY THEY DIDN'T. SUPPLANT FAMILY LAW CORD PORTERS BUT THE SUPPLANTED HARPER'S OVERALL SO I THINK NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE DIRECTIVE IS. TO SUPPLEMENT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COURT REPORTERS IN THE COURTHOUSE AS OPPOSED TO JUST SUPPLEMENT THE NUMBER OF COURT PERSONALLY FAMILY LAW. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD. THE OTHER THING TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD IS WHY YOU EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR FAMILY LAW. KEEP IN MIND YOU SHOULD LOOK AT HOW. MONEY IS ALLOCATED RIGHT NOW THAT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR COURT REPORTERS EVERY TIME THERE'S A JUDICIAL SLOT THERE'S MONEY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDED. FOR STAFF FOR MONEY IS PROVIDED FOR STAFF TO SUPPORT THE JUDICIAL POSITION. WHAT WE'RE FINDING THAT THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE RECORD QUARTER FOR EVERY JUDGE -- UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN FACTIF YOU WALK SIX BLOCKS FROM HERE. THE COURT REPORTERS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SCRAMBLING BECAUSE THERE ARE COURT ROOMS THAT ARE CLOSED EVERY DAY. HALF A DAY SOMETIMES A FULL DAY. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO COURT REPORTERS FOR THOSE COURT ROOMS. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REVENUE STREAMS ALREADY IN PLACE TO ENSURE THEIR CORE PORTS AVAILABLE BUT PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE TO ADD MONEY IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS OF HOW WE'RE MANAGING THE MONEY NOW -- LET ME JUST. COMING UP VERY QUICKLY I WILL SUMMON UP THAT AS YOU ALSO LOOK AT THIS KEEP IN MIND THAT COURT REPORTERS ARE THERE TRYING TO HIRE THEM. THEIR PAY THEIR TRANSFER FEES COVER THEIR COSTS FOR THE WORK IN THE EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS SET BY STATUTE. THIRTY YEARS AGO THOSE ARE TRYING TO HIRE NEW COURT REPORTERS AND WE LET THEM KNOW -- BY THE WAY HAVE TO WORK ON WEEKENDS IN THE EVENINGS AND IF YOU'RE BEHIND YOUR LATE. THE TRANSCRIPT FEE THAT YOU CAN CHARGE IT CUTS IN HALF BY STATUTE IN IT HASN'T BEEN REYES SINCE NINETEEN NINET THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AS WELL THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS TIM STEED ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER AT THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION PROBABLY REPRESENTING ELEVEN HUNDRED PLUS FRONTLINE WORKERS WORK FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. OFTEN WHENEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN OUR MINDS WE THINK OF JUDGES IN BLACK ROBES JUDGE. ATTORNEYS ARGUED FOR THEIR CLIENT BUT OFTEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE HAPPENS IN MUCH LESS GLAMOROUS BUT NO MUCH BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SPACES DONE BY PUBLIC SERVANTS. THESE PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE TAKEN AN OATH TO TAKE ON THE MORAL AND ETHICAL MISSION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT AND EMPOWER EVERYONE EQUALLY. THERE IS NO APPLICATION FOR THAT THERE ISN'T TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WILL AND ALWAYS WILL BE. PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE SO THE BEST USE AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE LAST YEAR'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE SUPERIOR COURT WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE GOVERNOR IS CURRENT RECOMMENDATION WE HOPE THE COMMITTEE CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE LOCAL SUPERIOR COURT SYSTEM SO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE WITH THE MISSION OF GOVERNMENT ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE THAT MISSION THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KATHY O'CONNELL I'M HERE FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF COURT REPORTER SERVICES FOR LOS ANGELES WHERE WE PROVIDE COURT REPORTERS IN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY COURTROOMS. ACROSS FORTY LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTY -- INCLUDING ALL FAMILY LAW COURT ROOMS I'M HAPPY TO SAY -- I'M HERE TODAY IN IN LIGHT OF SOME INFORMATION THAT I RECEIVED AFTER HEARING LAST WEEK -- AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THAT COURT REPORTERS ARE THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE COURT ROOMS -- BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE BE MEET MAYBE SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE COURTS ARE FACING -- IN REGARDS TO HIRING COURT REPORTERS AND SO I WANT TO COME TODAY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND JUST TO GIVE YOU THE FACTS ABOUT LOS ANGELES I CAN SPEAK FOR LOS ANGELES -- IN AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE HAVING IN COURT REPORTER RESOURCES SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I'LL GIVE YOU THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN NUMBERS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO APPLICATIONS FOR THE COURT REPORTER POSITION FOR THE COUNTY. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO APPLICANTS DID NOT QUALIFY THEY DID NOT HOLD A COURT REPORTER LICENSE THE STATE LICENSE -- A OR SOME OF THEM HAD CONVICTIONS THAT DID YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT CONDUCIVE TO WORKING FOR THE QUIRK. OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO APPLICATIONS WE HAD FIFTY SIX QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. WE CALLED ALL FIFTY SIX FOR INTERVIEW. TWENTY TWO DID NOT RESPOND OR DECLINED TO INTERVIEW. THAT LEFT US WAS THIRTY FOUR WE MADE THIRTY FOUR JOB OFFERS FOR THE POSITION OF COURT REPORTER FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. FOURTEEN DECLINE THE OFFER. SO IT NETTED US. TWENTY HIRES IN THE ENTIRE YEAR OF TWO CALENDAR YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO WHERE IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE WE RECEIVED A LOT OF APPLICATIONS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO WE ENDED UP WITH TWENTY HIRES FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. EXCUSE ME -- WE ALSO HAD THIRTY TWO COURT REPORTERS LEAVE SERVICE IN THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO WERE WERE UPSIDE DOWN ALREADY AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TO DATE SO WE'RE ABOUT AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER WE'VE RECEIVED. A TOTAL OF EIGHT APPLICATIONS FROM QUALIFIED COURT REPORTERS. AND WE'VE HAD WE'VE HIRED SIX OF THE EIGHT AND WE'VE HAD ELEVEN COURT REPORTERS LEAVE SERVICE SO FAR THIS YEAR SO AGAIN WE'RE STARTING OFF UPSIDE DOWN. THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY. I THINK THAT -- I'M SORRY BUT THEN THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- MICHELLE CASTER THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION -- WE REPRESENT TRIAL COURT EMPLOYEES AND THIRTY NINE COUNTY STRUCK CALIFORNIA. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING -- DISCRETIONARY FUNDS TO THE TRIAL COURT'S LAST YEAR -- WHAT THAT ENABLED? WHAT WAS UNIQUE ABOUT LAST YEAR IS THAT YOU PROVIDED TO POTS OF FUNDING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ALLOCATED TO ALL TRIAL COURTS? AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION FOR THE MOST UNDER FUNDED COURTS PRIOR TO THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE COMING TO THE TRIAL COURT'S WERE ALLOCATED UNDER THE WAFFEN METHODOLOGY SO THERE WERE. DONOR COURTS A RECIPIENT COURTS SO NOT ALL COURTS BENEFITTED EQUALLY DURING THE RESTORATION OF FUNDS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS UNTIL LAST YEAR. HOWEVER LAST LAST YEAR ALL COURTS WERE ABLE TO MAKE SOME MODEST IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'VE SEEN SOME NICE -- UP MOMENTUM THERE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL MOMENTUM THIS YEAR IT WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDS ALLOCATED TO ALL COURTS. AND SOME FUNDS ALLOCATED TO MOST UNDERFUNDED COURTS WE CAN CONTINUE TO BRING THEM UP. BUT A DISH ONLY -- TRIAL COURTS DO NOT HAVE ANY COST OF DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS OR A COLA IN THE BUDGETS. SO THEY ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT ON YOU KNOW ANY MODEST CHANGES IN THEIR BUDGET SO THEY CAN BUT BUDGET OVER YEARS RATHER THAN FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- IF THEY HAVE MID YEAR COST INCREASES THAT ARE ON ANTICIPATED THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MECHANISM TO ADDRESSES CASA BUSINESS CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY THEY DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO PREDICT -- ANY EVEN MODEST AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS FOR THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO WITH THEIR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES -- PRIOR TO I THINK WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE THERE WAS A MECHANISM IN THE TRUCK OR BUDGET CALL THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMóN ADJUSTMENT. ENACT AFFECT ACTED LIKE A COLA FOR THE TRIAL COURTS AND ALONG WITH THAT WAS -- SOME STATUTORY LANGUAGE THE KIND OF SAID WHAT THAT STATE APPROPRIATION LIMIT ADJUSTMENT WAS. FOR WE THINK IT'S TIME FOR TRIAL COURTS TO KIND OF HAVE THAT FORMULA COME BACK -- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT THEY'RE ONE OF THE VERY FEW BUDGETS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF COLA OR ANY KIND OF AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT. ON FOR CONCORD ANY DOING -- BUSINESS CHANGES SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT COME BACK WITH REGARD TO COURT BORDERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. CALIFORNIA LAW ONLY ALLOWS THE TRANSCRIPT A VERBATIM RECORD CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER. SO NOT ONLY ARE THE THE GOLD STANDARD THEY ARE THE STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU WANT A TRANSCRIPT. WE DO HAVE TWO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ONCE JAMISON BE DOSTA. THAT SAID ALL INDIGENT LITIGANTS ARE ENTITLED TO A A TRANSCRIPT IN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A COURT REPORTER. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THERE WAS A NOTHER DECISION. CALLED I DO CAN BE COMANCHE HILLS THE REMANDED DECISION BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT BECAUSE IT THE LITIGANT DID NOT HAVE. A TRANSCRIPT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CORPS PROPER PORTER PROVIDED TO THEM -- WE THINK THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED. THROUGH LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO BE USED FOR COURT REPORTERS WAS A NICE START BUT IT FALLS SHORT FROM THE NEED THE TRIAL COURT TO DO HALF SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME CONTINUED INVESTMENT TO BRING BACK. FAMILY LAW COURT REPORTERS AS WELL AS CIVIL REPORTER SINCE ALL INDIGENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE INDEED INDEED LITIGANTS HAVE THE RIGHT. TO RECEIVE A TRANSCRIPT -- ONE LAST THING JUST WANT TO SAY -- WE ALSO SUPPORT DEPENDENCY COUNCILS WHILE SPENDING FOR JUDGES BUT THE FUNDING FOR THOSE JUDGES IT COMES FOR STAFF MUST BE USED FOR STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD NIGHT ITEMS ISSUE NUMBER TWO THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OVER -- IN TERMS OF ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE TO ITS PRE TRIAL SERVICE FUNDING -- WILL HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AARON JOHNSON THE DIRECTOR OFFICE OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LUCY FOCUS THE NINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BUDGET SERVICES AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THIS AGENDA ITEM IS RELATED TO A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ALLOCATION OF A TWO YEAR IS. TO FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OPERATION VALUATION OF PROGRAMS ALL EFFORTS IN EIGHT TO TEN COURTS RAGE TO PRE TROUT DECISION MAKING. SITTING NEXT TO ME A SHIRLEY CURRENT SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICIAL COUNCIL. AND IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SHELLEY CURRENT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. OF THE PRIEST COULD TRIAL LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY I'M IS CHANGING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO AND THOSE CHANGES ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS AND LEGISLATION THAT'S BEING ADOPTED ANOTHER CHANGES THAT ARE ARE HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN TERMS OF LAWSUITS JUST LAST WEEK THERE WAS A HEARING -- IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA I'M A FEDERAL COURT CASE THAT LOOKED AT THE USE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFFS USE OF THE BELL SCHEDULE -- SHORTLY BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A A HEARING BEFORE OUR STATE SUPREME COURT -- THAT LOOKED AT THE SUPERVISION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RELEASED ON BAIL AND WERE AWAITING -- TO TO BUT ARGUMENTS TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HUMPHREY AND WEB THAT ALSO ADDRESS PRE TRIAL SO THINGS ARE REALLY HAPPENING. ADDITIONALLY ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR ADOPTED SB TEN THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES -- HOW PRE TRIAL IS HANDLED IN CALIFORNIA THAT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD UNTIL THE VOTERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT THAT AT THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION? AND THEN ALSO THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- THERE IS COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE ADOPTED SOME FORM OF PRE TRIAL CHANGE SUMMER MORE EXTENSIVE LIKE SANTA CLARA -- AS MISTER ROGERS WILL SPEAK ABOUT AND THEN OTHERS ARE ARE ARE SMALLER MORE INCREMENTAL CHANGES SO THINGS ARE REALLY HAPPENING. WHAT THIS PILOT WOULD SUGGEST DOING IS -- HAVING COURT PROGRAMS IN EIGHT TO TEN COURTS -- THAT'LL BE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE IN IN THOSE COURT RECORDS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE HAPPENING IS IS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE THE COUNTIES WITH PARDON ME THE COURT AND PROBATION -- BILL EXIST UNDER EXISTING TO OPERATE UNDER EXISTING LAW AS IT IS RIGHT NOW -- RISK ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AND DECISIONS WILL BE MADE PRE ARRANGEMENT AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT WILL HAPPEN. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AT THEIR MOST BASIC LEVEL. OUR TO FUND PRACTICES AND AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY AND RETURN TO COURT -- THAT WILL FOR SO LET'S TAKE A QUICK DECISION MAKING -- SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE ASSESSED QUICKLY AND IF THEY ARE SAFE TO BE RELEASED CAN BE RELEASED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS AFFECTS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE. WHEN THEY WERE DETAINED -- WHEN WHEN THEY COULD BE RELEASED SAFELY AND AND SOONER ADDITIONALLY -- WE WANT TO MINIMIZE BIAS IN THESE DECISION MAKING -- AND WE WANT TO EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS -- IN ORDER TO GAIN A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WORKS -- SO THAT IT CAN BE REPLICATED AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK SO THAT WE CAN AVOID THOSE PRACTICES. IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT WE ANTICIPATE BEING FUNDED -- WE IMAGINE CONTRACTS BETWEEN COURTS AND PROBATION IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS A JUDICIAL OFFICER RELEASED PRIOR TO RELATE ARRAIGNMENT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. VALIDATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE BEING USED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW VERY FEW OF THOSE TOOLS OF ACTUALLY BEEN VALIDATED ON THEIR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND SO PART OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO. RESULT IN THE VALIDATION OF SOME OF THE MAJOR TOOLS. DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN LOCAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTNERS AGAIN SO THAT THOSE DECISIONS CAN BE MADE QUICKLY AND ALSO DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE COURTS AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS IT RELATES TO PRE TRIAL SO THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE. YOU ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS NECESSARY AS YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE POLICY DECISIONS AND THEN THINGS LIKE COURT REMINDERS -- BUT I I THINK IT IS THAT IT'S EVIDENT THAT COURT REMINDERS WORK -- IN THE SAME WAY THAT RESTAURANT REMINDERS WORK OR HAIR CUT REMINDERS WORK COURT REMINDERS WORK AND SO REALLY ENHANCING SOME OF THOSE REMINDERS. IN TERMSOF HOW THE COURTS WILL BE SELECTED. THE CHIEF JUSTICE VERY RECENTLY APPOINTED A GROUP -- MADE UP OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES AND COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ONE OF THE CHARGES OF THAT GROUP IS TO CONSIDER THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL AND TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER -- SHOULD THIS BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BUDGET -- THAT WOULD THAT WORK GROUP HAS ALREADY STARTED ITS WORK IN ANTICIPATION OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS MIGHT BE INCLUDED RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ALL WILL WENT ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR WILL WILL BE MAKING THAT ULTIMATE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WILL BE INCLUDED AND WHAT THE EXACT. PARAMETERS WILL BE BUT IT JUST IN ANTICIPATION OF TRYING TO GET THE FUNDS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT GROUP HAS BEGUN WORK -- THAT'LL BE EIGHT TO TEN COURTS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT A DIVERSITY OF COURTS IN TERMS OF COURT SIZE AND LOCATION NORTHERN SOUTHERN CENTRAL -- COASTAL WE WANT TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS COURT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SO THAT TOOLS THAT WE LEARNED OF AND AT THAT WE DEVELOP CAN BE REPLICATED QUICKLY AND OTHER -- IN OTHER COUNT IN OTHER COURTS SO AS PRE TRIAL CHANGES WILL BE ABLE TO ADOPT THOSE PRACTICES QUICKLY AND OTHER AND THEN THE SAME IN TERMS OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ON RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF THOSE TOOLS THAT. ARE REPRESENTED ALSO -- I ANTICIPATE THAT THE COMMITTEE IS GOING TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE STRONG LOCAL COLLABORATION -- HISTORY OF SUCCESSFULLY MEETING -- A GRANT REQUIREMENTS ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE THE PILOT SOON AFTER ITS ADOPTED RIGHT NOW THE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ANTICIPATES A TWO YEAR PROGRAM AND SO GETTING UP AND RUNNING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE DATA THAT'S NECESSARY TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES TO MEASURE THE OBJECTIVES OF OF THE TOOL QUICKLY I'LL MENTION THE EVALUATION PLAN -- WE ANTICIPATE -- BEING ABLE TO COLLECT WE'RE COLLECTING THE DATA THAT'LL BE NECESSARY TO ASSESS EACH OF THE VALIDATED TOOLS -- USING THE PILOTS IN ORDER TO MEASURE ANY POTENTIAL BIAS -- TO DETERMINE -- IF THE PRE TRIAL PROJECT PRIDE A A PROJECTS REDUCE PRE TRIAL DETENTION -- DETERMINE IF THE PRE TRIAL PILOT PROJECTS REDUCE FAILED TO APPEAR AND ALSO TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS ALSO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE PANEL OF OF ACADEMICS -- IN ORDER TO HELP US -- WORK ON THAT DESIGN METHODOLOGY IN ORDER TO TO INSURE THAT WE MEET THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE. THAT ARE NEEDED AND SO WITH THAT I WILL JUST SUM UP BY SAYING -- WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT OF OF THIS POSSIBILITY OF OF WORKING -- IN THE COURTS AND AN ORDER TO DO A MUCH DEEPER DIVE SO THAT THE DAY THAT PRE TRIAL REFORM DOES COME ALONG IN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE BEAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. BUT THAT WE ARE PREPARED IN ORDER TO RESPOND QUICKLY. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR URBAN PANEL MY NAME IS AARON JOHNSON IN THE CURRENT DIRECTOR FOR PRE TRIAL SERVICES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS WELL AS AN EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR PRE TRIAL SITUATIONS. US PATROL SERVICE AGENCIES. I'VE BEEN A PREACHER A PRACTITIONER FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS AND AN ADVOCATE OF PRE TRIAL FORM IN KANSAS CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE. HAVING SAID THIS I'M HERE TO PROVIDE -- ONLY MY INDIVIDUAL PRE TRIAL PRACTITIONERS POINT OF VIEW -- BUT FOR FAR TOO LONG CALIFORNIA JAILS HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY HOLDING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOWER RISK TO THE COMMUNITY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD ARBITRARY AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR BAIL. THIS IS ALSO LET THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE HELD AS WELL AND CREATED A TWO TIERD SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. ONE FOR THOSE WITH MEANS AND ONES FOR THOSE WITHOUT. THIS SWELLING OF THE PRE TRIAL POPULATION IS ALSO COSTING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS IN THE FORM OF OVER USE OF THE MOST -- COST IN IN HUMANE OF RESOURCES IN THE FORM OF OUR JAIL BED SPACE. IN REVIEWING THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE SPECIFICALLY THE SECTION I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO MAKING FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE CHANGES OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA'S PRE TRIAL PROCESS. HOWEVER HAVE A FEW ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT WORDING OF THE STATE OF THIS SECTION AND HOW AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE LABELING OF THIS FUNDING FOR PILOT SITES THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES RECOGNIZES THESE EFFORTS IN A BEEN OCCURRING FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. AND CURRENTLY THERE FORTY SIX COUNTIES PROVIDING SOME LEVEL OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES AS A STATED EARLIER -- BUT THAT INFORMATION -- IT BASICALLY COMES FROM A REPORT THAT IS THREE YEARS OLD WE'D LIKE -- TO WE'D LIKE TO GET THIS INFORMATION UPDATED SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S OCCURRING -- IN THE PRE TRIAL SERVICES AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I FEEL THIS IS A MISSTEP IN ALLOCATION IS A PILOT PROGRAMS ARE NOT NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE BEEN CONTINUING LIKE I SAID AGENCIES DOING THIS WORK FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF ONGOING EFFORTS ARE. BY CONTRAST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COULD FUND FIFTY ONE OF THE FIFTY LOWER POPULATED COUNTIES WITH A SIMILAR PREACHER SYSTEM AS SUCH AND SENT A CLEAR AT THIS TIME. SECOND THE LANGUAGE FOLLOW SIMILAR FUNDING STRATEGIES DESCRIBED IN SENATE BILL TEN IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE REFERENDUM PASSED IN THE SENATE BILL TEN IS NOW ON THE BALLOT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY HOWEVER AS ALSO STATED RECENT LITIGATION WITH THE HUMPHRIES BUFF AND WEB DECISIONS. CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE NEED FOR THE COUNTIES TO RECEIVE ON GOING SUPPORT IS THESE DECISIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE OUR PRE TRIAL IS ADMINISTERED OVERNIGHT VERSES WAITING FOR BALLOT. OR REFERENDUM INITIATIVE IN. TWENTY TWENTY AS STATED BEFORE THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES WHO ALREADY HAVE SUCCESSFUL PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN THIS FUNDING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT. ALL SUCH PROGRAMMING -- IF LATE LIMITED TO JUST COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. THIS DOES NOT FOLLOW THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE CREATED AND SENATE BILL TEN AS THERE IS NOTHING INDICATING COURTS MUST CONTRACT WITH PROBATION ONLY THAT THE COURT MAY NOT CONTRACT WITH A QUALIFIED AGENCY THAT HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. FOR MAKING ARRESTED TO TENSIONS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION. THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT THE PRE TRIAL PROCESS IS NOT THE SAME AS POST ADJUDICATION PROBATION THE PRE TRIAL FOCUSES ABOUT WORKING WITH CLIENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY SHOW UP FOR COURT. AND ARE NOT A DANGER IN THE COMMUNITY. PRE TRIAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS HOLDING THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE AND ARE HELD TO A SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT STANDARDS LIKE PROBATION BASED ON THE LONG NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE. THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. WE SERVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND DEALING WITH SIMILAR BUT DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AS OUR CLIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY LAW VIOLATION. THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES ARE DISTINCTLY REVIEWED INTENSE NOT HE'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESEARCH PUBLICATION PRE TRIAL RELEASE ON PROBATION WHAT IS THE SAME AND WHAT IS DIFFERENT. IF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE NOT REVIEWED THIS MATERIAL I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THEY BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE INFORMATIVE AND FUNDAMENTAL LOOK AT THE TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES. PRIMARILY PREACHER RELEASE SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH A RECOGNIZED FORM OF PUNISHMENT. ONLY SERVING TO ENSURE THE CLIENT RETURNS TO COURT AND IS NOT A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. LASTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL BE UTILIZING THE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO THEM. TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE THE PRE TRIAL REFORM EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NOT A DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THAT I WAS AWARE OF AT THIS TIME. WHO WILL OVERSEE THIS AND PROVIDE A PLAN ON HOW THE COURTS IN PRE TRIAL AGENCIES WILL COMMUNICATE THE RESULTS TO THIS UNDER UNIDENTIFIED GROUP FOR COMPILATION A REVIEW? I WOULD SUGGEST PARTNERING WITH AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY LIKE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES AS MUCH OF THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED BY MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN THE STATE THEY'RE JUST NEEDS TO BE A COORDINATED EFFORT TO GATHER AND DISSEMINATE THE INFORMATION ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. IN CONCLUSION THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THE SERVICES THIS BILL INTENDS TO PILOT WITH THE MONEY SET ASIDE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE DRAFTERS OF THE BILL IT -- TALKING CONSULT WITH THE LEAD AGENCIES ALREADY PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO ALLOCATE THIS FUNDING TO PROMOTE THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND DESIGNATE A SPECIFIC PERSON AS A POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IN MOVING THE LEGAL AND MEANINGFUL PRE TRIAL REFORM IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY HELLO. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE PROPOSED PROGRAM COULD BE WORTHWHILE. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE LACK OF DETAIL MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE IT AND WEIGHED AGAINST ITS OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO BECAUSE OF THIS WE DO -- RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. TO SUBMIT A MORE WELL DEVELOPED PROPOSAL BY APRIL FOR THE FIFTEENTH FOR CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE SPRING BUDGET HEARINGS I'M SORRY [inaudible] YEAH. OF AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE INFORMATION IN FOUR KEY AREAS -- SOME OF THEM WERE TOUCHED ON IN MISS CURRENTS -- TESTIMONY BUT I THINK WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL THE FIRST AREA IS WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IN A MANNER. CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. THE SECOND AREA -- IS WHAT TYPE OF PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES WOULD BE SUPPORTED AND DO THEY MEET THOSE PROBLEM THOSE GOALS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. THE THIRD AREA IS HOW ALL THE FUNDING BE ALLOCATED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S BEING DONE IN A FAIR MANNER. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD KNOW IS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MOST OF THE DECISIONS ARE CURRENTLY LAUGHS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WHICH MEANS THAT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE LITTLE EMPLOY. IN WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE USED CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PRIORITIES. AND THE FOURTH AND FINAL AREA IS ACTUALLY THIS ISSUE ABOUT EVALUATION -- AND SPECIFICALLY THERE SHOULD BE DETAILS ON HOW THE FUNDED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES WILL BE EVALUATED IN A WAY THAT CAN INFORM STATEWIDE DECISION MAKING. AND SO CUMULATIVELY ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE THE PROGRAM. AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS STRUCTURED OPERATED AND FUNDED IN A WAY THAT MEETS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS. AND THAT THE FUNDING IS USED IN AN ACCOUNTABLE MANNER. SO WE ARE WITHHOLDING RECOMMENDATION PENDING THE SUBMISSION OF THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. ANY COMMENTS. YES PLEASE DON'T. THANK YOU AT ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE BUDGET ALLOCATION HERE AND CONTINUE TO THE WORK THAT WE STARTED WITH WITH SB TEN BUT I I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. BOTH FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT WHAT WE WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING AND IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DETAIL BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT. WE HAVE EXISTING AS WAS POINTED OUT APPROPRIATELY THERE THERE ARE. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING USED AND I THINK THAT PROVIDES IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BASIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAY OR MAY BE WORKING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BUT ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WAS NEGOTIATED OUT ON AT THE REQUEST OF THE ADMINISTRATION UNFORTUNATELY WAS DATA COLLECTION AND UNFORTUNATELY WE AGREED TO REMOVE DATA COLLECTION SO EVEN IF SB. TEN HAD MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THE THAT ABOUT MEASURE PUTTING IT IN ADVANCE. WE WERE NOT SET UP TO GET THE DATA COLLECTION THAT WE NEED AND NOT JUST ABOUT RISK OF FLIGHT AND SOME OF THOSE PIECES BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE PUT THESE PROGRAMS TOGETHER AND I THINK WE CAN USE. SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO TEST AGAINST THE BIAS THAT THEY REPRESENT. MEETING WHO'S BEING ALLOWED. TO TO LEAVE WHO'S NOT BEING ALLOWED TO LEAVE BASED ON COLOR RACE CRIMES POVERTY. ANY OF THOSE INDICATORS. THE PRE TRIAL. THE BAIL SYSTEM CASH MONEY BAIL SYSTEM HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE THE POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD BEAR. WITH IT AND ABSOLUTELY. WRONG HEADED WAY FOR US TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE HAVE ENOUGH EXAMPLES I THINK ACROSS CALIFORNIA BE ABLE LEVERAGE OFF OF SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED. FOR TO LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS AND SET UP A STRONGER SYSTEM OF DATA COLLECTION. TO LOOK AT WHO'S. WHO IS BEING DETAINED UNDER THIS RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS WHO'S NOT TO VALIDATE THE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS? PILOT PROGRAMS MAYBE WE CAN USE THE AS IS QUITE HAVE THE EXIT EXISTING PROGRAMS AS THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET OURSELVES UP FOR SUCCESS. ONCE ASSUMING. THAT BALLOT MEASURE FAILS AND WE'RE ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD ON ON PROP. TEN A WHAT THAT WORLD LOOKS LIKE BUT EVEN STILL I THINK WE CAN BE AS A STATE MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS. APPROPRIATE WE LOOKING AT THE VERSION SERVICES PRE TRIAL SERVICE SAYS -- KEEP LOOKING AT RISKS THAT PEOPLE REALLY REPRESENT FOR FLIGHT OR NOT FLIGHT BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS REYES TONIGHT THAT I AGREE WITH IS THAT IF WE ARE CAREFUL. WITH THE TOOLS THEY GET USE FOR THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS. THE COURTS COULD END UP STILL. DETAINING REQUIRING THE TENSION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE OF POOR MEANS WITH WITHOUT REALLY BALANCING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE COURTS HAS BEEN USING. A RISK ASSESSMENT TO I THINK TO SOME GREAT EFFECT IT'S OBVIOUSLY BACKED BY CASH MONEY BAIL WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF BY. SOME OF THESE THESE DATA EXIST SOME OF THESE TOOLS ARE ABLE TO BE ASSESSED IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED I THINK WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND THEN BE ABLE TO BETTERONCE WE COME OUT OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE CYCLE AND GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND USUALLY COUNCIL. THE THE TIME IN THE MEANTIME AND SOME RESOURCES TO BE ABLE LOOK AT THESE PROGRAMS LOOK AT THE DATA COLLECTION ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE NEED. AND REALLY DESIGNED A SYSTEM THAT WE CAN THEN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ONCE THIS QUESTION IS FINALLY SETTLED. SOME. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BUDGET OUT ALLOCATION I'M EXCITED ABOUT VERY INTERESTED IN AND I WOULD HOPE THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THIS COMMITTEE PROBABLY SHARES THIS. IS I HOPE YOU ARE ALL A PART OF THE SB. TEN GETTING THAT THROUGH OUR HOUSE AND THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BUT THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN. FOCUS FUNDS THAT'LL BE OF BEST A FACT SO THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE TO PUT POLICY IN PLACE TESTED AND ENSURE THAT WE KNOW HOW IT'S BEING USED IN EACH COUNTY WHO'S BENEFITING FROM IT AND AND AND HAVE A PATH TO DETERMINE. THAT IT IS BEING USED TO THE FACT THAT WE WOULD INTEND FOR THE REASONS THAT WE GOT RID OF CASH MONEY BATH. SO AGREE WITH LA -- WE NEED SOME MORE DETAIL TO THAT I HOPE THAT YOU JUST CANCEL. THE MYSTERIES YOU CAN WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WE CAN FOCUS THIS SAID THAT WITH THAT THESE MONIES CAN BE USED TO GREAT EFFECT. AND REALLY SET UP TO THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA. AFTER CASH MONEY BAIL SYSTEMS AND THIS IS A AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO BE LOOKING AT THIS TIME. YES MISTER YEAH GEN. I THANK YOU AND ALSO SOMEONE I WAS ALSO THE JOINT AUTHORS SB -- TENNIS THIS IS VERY THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. AND I SAY THAT IN IN. IN THE BACKDROP OF A MANY OF US NOW HAVE TWELVE YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX I ONCE HAD THE HONOR OF SITTING. WHERE DOCTOR WEBER WAS SITTING IN MY FIRST YEAR WE ASKED ABOUT A -- A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT THE A OC WAS WORKING ON I DON'T THINK WE EVER GOT THAT COMPUTER SYSTEM WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AND WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION -- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE TOLD ME WITH THE CDO SEE TOLD ME IT WAS THE PRESIDING JUDGES THE PRESIDING JUDGES TOLD ME WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND WE'RE GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES. THEN EVERYBODY WAS PLAYING THE LEGISLATURE FRAGMENT OF MONEY THEY WERE BLAMING THE GOVERNOR. AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR ME TO START. IF THIS DOESN'T GO RIGHT. I NEED TO KNOW WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS GETS DONE. AND BEFORE YOU SAY YOU ARE. JUST REMEMBER THIS. SUCCESS HAS A MANY MANY MANY FATHERS FAILURE HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF WORTH. OKAY. AND SO -- RIGHT NOW. IF YOU CAN TELL ME [inaudible] WHO ULTIMATELY? WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING. THIS THIS NEW SYSTEM PRE TRIAL ALL OF IT IS THE ONE CENTRALIZED. INDIVIDUAL IS A THE CHIEF JUSTICE. HOPE YOU DON'T SEE ISSUE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE THEN YOU JUST A CONSEQUENCE TELL ME THEY REPORT TO THE CHIEF JUST AND JUSTICE AND SAY THEY WORK WITH BUT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN. MY HEAD'S GOING TO EXPLODE YOU NEED THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT HAVING TWELVE YEARS. I WOULD BE GONE RIGHT NOW. DOCTOR WEBER WOOD BECAUSE I RIGHT NOW. MY COLLEAGUES TO MY LEFT WOULD BE GOAL RIGHT NOW WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY. TO KNOW HOW ORGANIZATIONS WORK WITHIN THE STATE AND HOW THINGS DON'T GET DONE. AND HE IS WAY FOR THE NEXT GROUP ELECTED OFFICIAL COME IN AND YOU JUST KIND OF KIND OF REHASH THE SAME THING. YOU DON'T HAVE A LUXURY ANYMORE. AND SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THIS. OKAY I WILL I WILL TRY THAT -- ONE SO THE WAY THAT THE THE FUNDING IS STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW IS THE DOLLARS WILL GO FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL APPROPRIATE FUNDS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHO IT IS -- ABOUT THE COURTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED THAT BEING SAID -- THERE WILL BE CLEAR -- REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE PRESUMABLY THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ONCE ONCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN INCLUDED -- AND THEN THERE WILL BE CONTRACTS BETWEEN -- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE COURTS ARE INTER BRANCH AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE COURTS -- TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES FOR THE FUNDING -- THE COURTS THE AND WILL TURN AND THEY WILL CONTRACT WITH PROBATION IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE RISK ASSESSMENT BUT ULTIMATELY THE DATA AND THE REQUIREMENTS WILL COME FROM THE FROM THE COURTS TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COUNCIL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING YOU ALL INFORMATION ABOUT. THE SUCCESSES AND THE FAILURES OF THE PROGRAM. SO NO DISRESPECT OKAY BUT I USED TO DO THAT TOO THAT'S THAT SO. BUREAUCRATIC MUMBO JUMBO I USED TO THAT TOO JUST TO SPEND SPEND AND SPEND. IT SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON IN CHARGE. DO YOU GAVE ME A BUREAUCRATIC ANSWER OF HOW THE MONEY FLOWS. BUT YOU WON'T YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME IF THE MONEY SPENT INAPPROPRIATELY. WHO'S GOING TO BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR TO EXPLAIN TO THIS COMMITTEE. WHAT WHAT WENT WRONG BUT MORE IMPORTANT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO FIX IT? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT. YOU CAN GIVE ME AN ANSWER YOU GAVE ME HOW THE MONEY WILL FLOW AND HOW IT SPENT. AND AND ULTIMATELY -- MIGHT ALSO BE THE REASON WHY WE DON'T HAVE A FULL FLESHED OUT PLANNED YOU ALSO TOLD ME. THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WOULD PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF JUDGES. TO HELP DECIDE HOW THIS SYSTEM IS BEING DONE SO LET ME JUST ANOTHER BODY. OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS AND NO DISRESPECT TO LAWYERS AND PRESS THE COMPANY. EXCLUDED I GOT. HOME WITH A BUNCH OF LAWYERS -- DECIDING HOW ULTIMATELY ALL THIS GOES COULD YOU NOT ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS IMPACTING. I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD TALK TO PEOPLE THAT -- HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS RISK ASSESSMENT SO YOU MAKE A SYSTEM THAT WILL ALSO BENEFIT THEM INCLUDING THE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS. THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A TOP DOWN KIND OF SYSTEM WHICH IS. WHICH IS BEGINNING TO SOUND LIKE AND SO [inaudible] I I DEFINITELY WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH US GIVING YOU YOU SOME KIND OF FUNDING TO YOU CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS OF FLUSHING ALL OF THIS OUT. BUT I HOPE IN IT. YOU ULTIMATELY HAVE SOMEBODY STEP UP AND SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR IT THIS FOR GETTING THIS DONE. AND THAT'S USUALLY. ONE INDIVIDUAL ONE PERSON NOT A GROUP OF OTHER PERSONS NOT A COMEDIAN YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE IS GONNA BE CHAIR SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF SOMETHING AROUND HERE. AND SO ON THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL D. D. THE CHIEF JUSTICE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN IN IN THE COURSE THEY WILL WE'LL PROBABLY DO IN A LIFETIME. WE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN TWENTY TWENTY IF IF WE'RE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A HEAD START ON IT. SO WE'RE NOT STARTING FROM THE BEGINNING BUT MORE IMPORTANT. WE'RE NOT HAVING A DISCUSSION. TWENTY TWENTY ONE CAN YOU GIVE US A FLUSH TO HER -- UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT WHO'S ON FIRST BASE HOW WOULD THE MONEY. BE SPENT AND HOW YOU TO PUT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND FOLLOW UP SO YOU CAN COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE SO WE'RE NOT TO GIVE YOU. GIVE YOU ADVICE OR GIVE YOU MORE MONEY OF WHAT EVERY WEEK NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. IN THE COUNTRY SO HOPEFULLY WHEN WE SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU'LL HAVE A NAME. IN A POSITION FOR ME. OKAY. WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS I THINK -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THAT THERE WAS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PUT IN THE BUDGET WITHOUT A PLAN. AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE GIVEN US SOME GOOD INFORMATION FOR MOST OF US WE STILL WANT TO SEE THE PLAN. ONE OF WRITTEN DOWN AS TO HOW IT OPERATES WHERE IT GOES SO UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE AND THE UNFORTUNATE. FACT THAT IS BE TEN IS BEING HELD AT GIVE THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO THEN. FASHION A A REAL CLEAR PLAN AND AND HOPEFULLY SOME IMPLEMENTATION AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT CURRENTLY EXIST. WE ARE ACCORDING TO YOU THEIR NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE A HOW EXTENSIVE THEY ARE. OR WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE JUST LABELED IT AS PRE TRIAL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLACE ELSE TO PUT IT A CALL IT -- BUT I THINK WE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A COMMITTEE FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IS OBVIOUSLY MORE DETAILS -- WHO IS THIS WHERE IS IT GOING TO BE WHO? YOU HAVE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR I'M SURE SOMEBODY KNOWS WHO'S GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE BUT ALSO WHAT WE'RE ASSESSING WE'RE WE'RE OF WITH THE ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE -- WHAT HAVE WE DONE THAT'S GOOD ALREADY? WHAT DO WE NEED TO CHANGE WHAT WORKS IN SMALL AREAS WHICH WORKS IN LARGE COMMUNITIES -- IS IT IS IT OKAY TO USE OUR TO PROBATION DEPARTMENT OR DO OUR OTHER AREAS WORKING BETTER WE NEED TO KNOW THAT SO. OUR CHARTS TO YOU BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING WITH THIS IS TO GIVE US A PLAN. OF A ANSWERING THE ISSUES THAT THE MEMBER SUPPORT FOR AN ANSWERING THE ISSUES THAT LA -- HAS PUT FORTH OF IF WE'RE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL I THINK IT IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT IT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR US TO MOVE FOR WITH THAT PLAN -- THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I'M SURE SOMEBODY AT THAT HAS A WHOLE LIST OF WHAT THEY COULD DO IT WITH A BUNCH OF COURT REPORTER SO WHATEVER. SO LET'S HOPE THAT WE GET THAT WE GET A UNDERSTANDING OF IT IN A THOROUGH PLAN AS TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHO'S GOING TO DO IT. AND WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT OUR GOALS ARE SO THE WE KNOW WITH THE NOT WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THEY SAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GO ON IN A ROW TO TAKE YOU THERE. CLEARLY IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE ASSESSING EVERYTHING WILL LOOK LIKE SUCCESS -- SO AS A RESULT WE NEED A LOT MORE DETAIL THANK YOU ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT REAL LONG.

WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE IN TWO AREAS AND THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ACTUALLY CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY. SO THE FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDED AS ARE ALL WOULD REQUIRE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT BY JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON HOW THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG HAS CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO THE EXTENT THE BACKLOG HAS GROWN THE LANGUAGE RIVER WERE WOULD REQUIRE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT ON THE REASONS FOR THAT GROWTH. AND THE STEPS IT PLANS ON TAKING TO ADDRESS IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS OR WHETHER ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NECESSARY. THE SECOND AS ARE ALL UP SECOND SET A RECOMMENDED US ARE ALL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO SIMILARLY SUBMIT A REPORT. BY JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON THE ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT WERE SUPPORTED USING THESE DOLLARS AND THIS WOULD JUST HELP ENSURE THAT THE MONIES WERE USED CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE MEMBERS. OKAY IN A QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE COMMENTS. OKAY FINE I THINK IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR TERMS WHAT BEING ASKED IN TERMS OF OTHER PROPOSAL WITH REGARDS TO REPORTING OUT IN TERMS OF HOW FAR YOU'VE GONE AND WHAT AND WHY IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE REASONABLE. OKAY LET'S MOVE THE ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR IT'S HELD OVER. ISSUE FOR DEALS WITH VARIOUS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. IN EVERY FOR HAVING THE THE THE SERGEANT HAD TO JUST TAKE PROVIDING A HAND OUT AS AN OVERVIEW OVER A BCP'S ALMOST SPEAK TO THEM AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL PRIORITIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. NOT FOCUSING ON THE IMF THE IMPROVING THE MODERNIZATION FUND AND THE TWO BCP'S THAT ARE RELATED TO THIS. I'M ALL START WITH THE BC PEAS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE THE NEED FOR THEM SO THE FIRST IS A AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION OF FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THE DEFENSE AN INDEMNITY OF ALL A JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES THIS WOULD HELP OFFSET COSTS IN THE I MF OF A FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THE NEXT ISSUE IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PHOENIX ROAD MAP INCLUDING SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND -- AND THIS IS TO MAINTAIN AND UPGRADE THE FENIX -- ENTERPRISE RESOURCE. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS SUPPORT THE Và CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF THE STATEWIDE HUMAN RESOURCES PAYROLL SOLUTION THIS WILL ALSO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE IMPROVEMENT MODERNIZATION FUN. WHY THESE NECESSARY -- LIKE MANY STATE FUNDS -- THE IMPROVEMENT MODERNIZATION FIND RELIES ON FINES AND FEES -- MANY OF THEM -- CRIMINAL BASED AND THOSE RE DECLINING REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO END TO ENSURE SOLVENCY OF THE FUND AND MAINTAIN CRITICAL -- EXPENDITURES OUT OF THESE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE TRIAL COURT'S -- THESE -- BCP'S -- ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT MOMENT SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT -- AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS -- THIS BUDGET CYCLE. HEY MAKE COMMENTS IN FINANCE HOW MUCH I'M WORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS WAS NOTED THAT IMPROVE AND MODERNIZATION FUND OR THE I AM UP AS WHAT WE CALL IT RECEIVES REVENUES FROM FINES AND FEES FROM CRIMINAL CASES. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PROBABLY PLENTY OF TIMES IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THOSE REVENUES HAVE CONTINUED DECLINE I WILL JUST NOTE THAT -- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS WELL AWARE OF THIS AND WE ARE TRACKING AND AND I THINK IN RECOGNITION OF THE LA WAS RECOMMENDATION THAT I THINK MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE HOLISTICALLY BEFORE WE START. DEPOSITING INDIVIDUAL FINDING FEES AND TO THE GENERAL FUND -- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE MONITORING. OKAY COMING FROM LA -- WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA BECAUSE WE DID FIND THAT THEY WERE JUSTIFIED ON A WORKLOAD BASIS AND ARE NEEDED FOR JUDICIAL BRANCH OPERATIONS. WE DO HAVE LARGER CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION FUND -- AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS ONE HAS CONSISTENTLY HAD OPERATION FOR FALLS IN ABSENT ANY ACTIONS OF LIKELY TO GO INSOLVENT IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTIONS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER YEARS TO HELP WITH THE SOLVENCY OF THIS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE COST OF OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL. ON TOP OF THAT AS IS -- IS LAID OUT ON PAGE TEN OF YOUR AGENDA -- THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS LITTLE OVERSIGHT OVER AT THE IMF EXPENDITURES THE JUDICIAL BRANCH GENERALLY REPORTS AFTER THE EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN MADE. AND ON TOP OF THAT THE JUDGE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS OFTENTIMES STRUGGLED TO MATCH EXPENDITURES TO REVENUES AND AND WE WOULDN'T KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DECLINE IN CARMEL FIND A REFER FEE REVENUE IS OUTSIDE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS HANDS. SO TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE ANTEL INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE DO OFFER THREE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS TO DEPOSIT -- I AM F. REVENUES INTO THE GENERAL FUND ELIMINATE THE IMF. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE TO THE PROGRAM'S IRRESPECTIVE. OF THE AMOUNT OF CARMEL FINE IF YOU REVENUE THAT'S COMING IN. AND IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED TO CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH I AM UP SOLVENCY. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT ON THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RECEIVING I AM UP SUPPORT. BY DECEMBER FIRST HAND SO THAT GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO KIND OF JUSTIFY THE PROGRAMS AND HELP THE LEGISLATURE EVALUATE THEM AND DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE. OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS OFTEN GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO IN THE MEANTIME FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING SO THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD WHILE THE ASSESSMENTS TAKING PLACE. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CUT CONSISTENT WITH OUR BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO IMPROVING THE STATE'S COME OFF I ENVY SYSTEM [inaudible] OKAY. ANY COMMENTS A QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. OF THE SYSTEM THAT I WOULD JUST ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT LAST POINT AND WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE MENTIONING THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FINES AND THE SYSTEM. IN HER STATE OF THE JUDICIARY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS EVERY PLACE THAT IS FUNDED BY THOSE FINES AND FEES. WE NEED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT IS IF WE'RE GOING. TO APPROPRIATELY REMOVE THE JUDICIAL BRANCHES RELIANCE ON FINES AND FEES WE WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT IT IS WERE FUNDING AND WHY WHAT ALL THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. AND THEN STOP THIS RELIANCE ON A SYSTEM THAT'S BECOME REALLY UNFAIR AND UNFAIR TO TO THE PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO TO BE FAIR. SO THAT I THINK THAT POINT IS WELL TAKEN THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT PROGRAMS WHAT THEIR EXPENSES ARE AND NOT NECESSARILY RELY ON THAT OLD STRUCTURE FROM. ANY OF THE COMMENTS. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE I THINK -- A WE AGREE WITH THAT THAT OF THE I AM A FUN CONTINUES EVERY YEAR TO HAVE SOME ISSUES AND ANYTHING THAT'S FUNDED NOW BY FINES AND FEES SINCE WE DECIDED THAT QUITE OFTEN THOSE FINES AND FEES OR UNFAIR AND SO WITH. HAVING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE SYSTEM -- AND THIS IS A REAL REFLECTION OF THAT THAT AT SOME POINT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISION I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET ANY BETTER. ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERYONE IS DECIDED THAT THE SYSTEM OF FINES AND FEES IS OFTEN UNFAIR AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT AND JUSTICE WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE SUCH FINES AND FEES ALL THE TIME. UP SAYS HE THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY. FOR SO AS A RESULT IT PUTS THE ALL THOSE COOL SOURCES. INTO OF JEOPARDY AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT. TO THE EXTENT THAT PROBABLY AD NAUSEUM WE REMEMBER THOUGH WHO GETS A PENNY WHO GETS THREE PENNIES ARGUES FOR PENNIES FROM IS JUST A A SYSTEM ITSELF THAT IS. IS JUST. A IT IT PROBABLY TAKES MORE MONEY TO MAINTAIN ALL THOSE LITTLE NUMBERS AND IT DOES WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT SO I KNOW THAT. BUT CLEARLY -- THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL CONSIDER BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE -- IT'S ASYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN AND IT'S NOT GONNA REPAIR ITSELF THAT'S CLEAR. YOUR COMMENTS ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE. IT MOVES TO THE FINAL ITEM WITH NUMBER FIVE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL AND EQUAL ACCESS FUND LESLIE STAR. HI I'M HI MODES I LOVE HIM UP FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA. AND GERRY SMITH IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WELCOME. YOUR MINISTER YEAH OKAY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICHEVER ONE OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. LESLIE HI MY FROM CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTIES FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE -- FOR ALL THE SUPPORT YOU'VE PROVIDED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ADDED TO THE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL BUDGET. IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND WHILE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO REACH THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM CASELOAD OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CLIENTS. HER ATTORNEY IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT SERVING THE MOST FRAGILE AND COMPLEX CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR STATE IS EXPENSIVE -- IT WOULD AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE TWO QUICK EXAMPLES OF HOW THAT HAS PLAYED OUT FOR US CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER HAS BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE THE BENEFICIARY OF SEVERAL GRANT FUNDED OF GRANT FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE SOME PROJECTS WITH. ONE IS CALLED THE CARE PROGRAM THE GOAL OF THAT PROGRAM IS TO AND THE FOSTER CARE TO PRISON PIPELINE. IN THAT PROGRAM WE'VE SERVED A HUNDRED AND FORTY CHILDREN OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND KEEPING IN MIND WE HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND CHILD CLIENTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SO WE SERVED A HUNDRED AND FORTY CHILDREN ALL WHO ALL OF WHOM WERE IN FOSTER CARE AND THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ARRESTED AND WE'RE FACING A DELINQUENCY PROCEEDINGS. THAT PROJECT IS STAFFED BY TWO ATTORNEYS THREE CASE MANAGERS SEVERAL MSW AND AND SEVERAL MSW INTERNS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS OF SERVING THOSE HUNDRED AND FORTY CHILDREN. WE'VE HAD ONE CHILD AND UP IN ADULT JAIL WE'VE HAD TO END UP IN CAMP 86% OR IN SCHOOL OR HAVE COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. BOTH IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND IN NEED FOR PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION WERE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THOSE RESULTS AND IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE THAT ONLY ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY HAS MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE ADULT. PENAL SYSTEM. BUT WE COULD NEVER DO IT ON OUR STATE FUNDING BECAUSE OUR STATE CASELOADS ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT CLIENTS. FOR ONE ATTORNEY AND THIS PROJECT TAKE SIX SEVEN ADULTS ON PAID ON THE SALARY ON ON PAYROLL -- TO SERVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY BUT IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND WE WANT TO BE TO DO MORE OF THAT BUT WE CAN'T ON THE CURRENT BUDGET REQUIREMENTS. THE CARD CURRENT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS SIMILARLY AND ARE SPECIALIZED COURT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING WE HAVE AGAIN A TEAM OF TWO ATTORNEYS TO CASE MANAGERS AND ONE SURVIVOR ADVOCATE BETWEEN THEM SERVING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YOUNG WOMEN -- WHICH AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE RESULTS THAT PROJECT IS NEWER -- AND IT'S AND IT'S A MUCH HEAVIER LEFT HONESTLY TO HELP THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE -- CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND CHANGE THEIR SITUATIONS BUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO FAR AND AGAIN COULD NEVER DO THAT WITHOUT GRANT FUNDING WHICH IS GREAT FOR SEATING AND GREAT FOR PILOTING AND FOR EXPLORING -- OPTIONS IN SERVING OUR CLIENTS BUT IT CAN'T SUSTAIN SOMETHING LONG TERM. SO OUR FIELD IS IS WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE PAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND AS A COMMUNITY WERE POISE. TO PUT EMERGING BEST PRACTICES INTO PLACE BUT WE CANNOT MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS GERRY SMITH AND I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A NON PROFIT THAT PROVIDES FREE CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES. EARLY IN THE AREAS OF HOUSING HEALTH -- PUBLIC BENEFITS AND CIVIL RIGHTS TO POOR AND DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS TWENTY THREE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING SACRAMENTO I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH INCLUDES NINETY FIVE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH LIKE MY ORGANIZATION ALSO RECEIVE EQUAL ACCESS PHONE SUPPORT -- I WANT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE INCREASES IT HAS PROVIDED TO THE A. F. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AFTER THAT APPROPRIATIONS BUT STAGNANT FOR FOR MANY YEARS -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE LAST YEAR THAT DATE IS AVAILABLE -- THOSE NINETY FIVE ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN LACK SERVED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CLIENTS. OF WHOM OVER SIXTY THOUSAND WE'RE SENIORS OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND WERE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND NEARLY TEN THOUSAND WERE VETERANS WE ALSO SERVED OVER TWENTY THOUSAND YOUNGER PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AS INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS NOT CONNECTED AS CHILDREN WITH RESPECT TO AN ADULT HEADED -- HOUSEHOLD. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- THE LEGAL SERVICES COMMUNITY FOR SERVICE AS THE FIRST LEGAL RESPOND ORDERS WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE. MY ORGANIZATION ASSISTED OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR ALONE. AT LOCAL DISASTER CENTERS FOLLOWING -- THAT THE CAMPFIRE IF YOU COUNTY AND WE SERVED OVER THREE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOLLOWING THE CAR FIRE IN SHASTA COUNTY A LITTLE EARLIER AND MY COLLEAGUES AT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- HAVE SERVE THOUSANDS OF DISASTER VICTIMS AS WELL -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN CINEMA AND NAPA AND COUNTIES IN VARIOUS PLACES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND YET OUR STATE STILL AS A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE IT'S LEGAL SERVICES RESOURCES AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. FOR EVERY CLIENT WE SERVE WE TURN AWAY AS MANY AS TEN OTHERS FOR WE PROVIDE THEM WITH FEWER SERVICES AS THEY REQUIRE FOR SOLUTION. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE FEDERAL LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION ESTMATED THAT NATION WIDE 71% OF ALL LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE PERSONS ANNUALLY EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROBLEM. AND 86% OF THOSE PERSONS ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS A LAWYER AT ALL TO HELP THEM RESOLVE IT. AND AS MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR HELP TO CLOSE THIS GAP -- A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THE WHITE HOUSE SUBMITTED ITS TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO CONGRESS AND FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR THE PRESIDENT -- PROPOSES ZERO FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION. HIS EFFORT TO ABOLISH JEALOUSY -- THE FIRST TWO YEARS WAS THWARTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A TWO YEAR BUDGET DEAL THAT CONGRESS MADE. IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- BUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS CURRENT YEAR -- THE ELEVEN LSC FUNDED PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE OF WHICH MY ORGANIZATION IS. ONE RECEIVED. A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WE DID IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN BECAUSE OF CENSUS REDISTRIBUTIONS THAT -- SENSES -- RELATED REDISTRIBUTIONS THAT -- LSC WAS MAKING NATIONALLY SO WE'RE STILL -- LOSING MONEY ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. THIS YEAR WE ANTICIPATE TO TWENTY TWENTY FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT WAS EVEN LAST YEAR. THE TWENTY ELEVEN RECESSION ERA BUDGET REDUCTIONS. REQUIRED BUDGET THAT REDUCTIONS AS PART OF THAT SO CALLED SEQUESTRATION LEGISLATION COMES BACK INTO PLACE. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THOSE THOSE ARE MANDATORY 10% REDUCTIONS IN LESS A LOT OF HOOPS ARE JUMPED THROUGH -- AND WE WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN IS IS VERY HIGH OVER -- THIS COMING YEARS -- BUDGET -- SO WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT AND DIGITAL INCREASING CALIFORNIANS EF -- THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OVERSIGHT OF THESE FUNDS -- OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF VERY VERY CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE STATE'S DECADES LONG SYSTEM OF LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING ADMINISTRATION WAS COMPLETED. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OUR STATE BAR -- AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE THE THE SYSTEM OF FUNDING ADMINISTRATION THROUGH THE LEGAL SERVICES A TRUST FUND COMMISSION. IS CREDIBLE AND EFFICIENT. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE STATE LEGAL SERVICES COMMUNITY IS I THINK A CRITICAL PARTNER. OF THIS LEGISLATURE. EVERY YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE AN AXE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNS DOZENS OF NEW LAWS THAT ARE -- DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF POOR AND DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN AREAS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EDUCATION AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND HEALTH CARE AND AN EMPLOYEE FOR AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PUBLIC BENEFITS AND IF THE TARGETS OF THOSE VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE IMPOSES EVERY YEAR -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOUR RESTRICTIONS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS. FINANCE COMPANIES. IF IF THESE ENTITIES IGNORE OR FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS THAT YOU ALL AN ACT THEN THE LEGISLATURE HIS ENACTED. HOLLOW PROMISES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE COMMUNITY PRESENTS TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THESE LAWS. AND SO IT IS THE STATE WIDE LEGAL AID COMMUNITY FUNDED IN PART BY THE EQUAL ACCESS FUND WHICH SERVES AS THIS LEGISLATURE'S PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS LEGISLATORS WILL EVERY YEAR YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT FINES AND FEES AND CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE TO THEM. MY ORGANIZATION HAS GONE INTO THE SUPERIOR COURTS OF VERY HELPFUL HOST EVERY COURT IN MIGHT JURISDICTION -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE NOT IGNORING THE CHANGES THAT YOU MADE TO THE FINES AND FEES SYSTEMS WHICH I CAN SADLY TELL YOU THEY WERE UNTIL THEY WERE PRODDED INTO COMPLIANCE -- SO WE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE TO TRY AND EFFECTUATE THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE GROUND. IN ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO SO WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASES THAT YOU PROVIDED TO DATE WE HAVE AMOUNT EQUAL JUSTICE OF AXIS FUND OF ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE THINK WOULD BRING US CLOSER TO COMPLIANCE. WITH THE THE THE JUSTICE GAP NEEDS AND WE WILL BE APPRECIATIVE OF ANY SUPPORT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR US THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. AND WHEN OUR SPEAKER IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM TOOK THE POLICY CHAIRS. PLACE THEM ON THIS BUDGET PENNY THAT. MAKE THE BENEFIT THAT WE HAVE IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN THE POLICY ROUND BRING IT INTO THE BUDGET CONTACTS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. MY LETTER. WHICH IS ASKING FOR DEPENDENCY COUNCIL AND FULLY FUNDING IT BY ADDING THE SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. ADDING. COURT REPORTERS WHICH WE DEALT WITH EARLIER AND AGAIN CREASING THAT TO THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AN EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COURTS AND COURTS FUNDING THE BEST WAY WE CAN I THINK FRAME IT IS AS ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DID IT? THE WEALTHIEST AMONG US WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY THE POOREST AMONG US DON'T THEM AND THIS IS THE THE NEXUS OF POLICY AND BUDGET. SO IN JUDICIARY. WHICH WE OVERSEE THE THE CIVIL LEGAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE WORKING HARD WITH THE STATE BAR TO ENSURE THAT THEY THAT LAWYERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE MEETING THEIR OBLIGATION. TO LEGAL SERVICES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ARE LOOKING AT DIVERSITY WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF THINGS TO MAKE THE LEGAL PROFESSION. MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OF CALIFORNIA. SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THAT IS THIS LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING ALL OF THOSE NEEDS. WITH WHETHER IT'S DISASTERS OF A NATURAL KIND WEATHER'S DISASTERS OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KIND. FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT OUR FOLKS ARE IN CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING WITH. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. BUILT A SYSTEM THAT GIVES THEM ACCESS THE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL. PIECES ONE IT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART IS YOU PROBABLY KNOWS WE'VE BEEN. DEALING WITH THAT SYSTEM. THESE ARE KIDS THAT DAY AT THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS THAT DEPENDENCY COUNCIL HAVE OF HELPING THOSE KIDS STAY OUT OF FUTURE JUSTICE ENTANGLEMENTS AND VERY EXPENSIVE ENTANGLEMENTS. IS SIGNIFICANT THAT'S WHAT THIS FUNDING IS IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THOSE KIDS AND INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY I SEE MYSELF AS AS A A CONDUIT TO THIS ASK FOR A NUMBER OF THESE AND BRINGING THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION OF THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND OUR ABILITY. TO WORK BOTH ON THE POLICY SIDE IN THE BUDGET SIDE TO SOLVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE ASK IT'S BEEN VERY WELL ARTICULATED HERE I I'VE BEEN A PART OF MAKING THIS ASK AGAIN AND AGAIN. KEEPING IT ON THE TABLE KEEPING IT AS A PART OF OF THIS.

GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON MICHAEL BURNS ON WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY JUVENILE DEFENSE PANEL. I'VE BEEN HERE IN YEARS PAST I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO COME BACK HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT THROUGH YOUR WISDOM. YOU'VE ACTUALLY SAVE SOME LIVES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- THE INCREASED FUNDING THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US IN THE PAST YEARS. HAS BEEN ABLE TO ALLOW US TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE CHILDREN AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE DELINQUENCY SYSTEM. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT -- IF YOU CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US AND FUND US. WE'RE GONNA GET TO A POINT TIME WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT PRE TRIAL SENTENCING OR SERVICING. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO HOME TONIGHT YOU'VE CHANGED ALLIES OF MANY CHILDREN MY COUNTY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BILL SURVEY ON A DEPENDENCY COUNCIL IN NORTH OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. I GENERALLY REPRESENT PARENTS BUT I'M ACTIONS SPEAK -- FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT CHILDREN -- OF WHICH THERE ARE -- THREE ATTORNEYS CURRENTLY DOING THAT -- THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY ALLOCATED THE OUR EXISTING ON FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS PER MONTH THAN THEY DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THERE'S NO LONGER OF ADEQUATE FUNDING. FOR INTERPRETERS -- INVESTIGATORS AND IN. CERTAIN CASES WHERE IT'S EXPERTS ARE NEEDED FOR THINGS LIKE -- BONDING STUDIES -- OR SPECIAL CASES WERE WE'RE DEALING WITH -- AUTISTIC CHILDREN -- AND TO THAT SORT OF THING -- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK THAT THEY HAVE. TO HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING AND ESTABLISHING A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CLIENTS THAN WE DO WITH OUR ADULT CLIENTS. AND THIS IS REQUIRING BECAUSE OF THEM BEING UNABLE HIGHER SOCIAL WORKERS ARE INVESTIGATORS SAY TRAVEL LITERALLY AROUND THE STATE TO HAVE TO MEET AND SPEND TIME WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS AND KEEP TRACK THEM -- SO WE ARE URGING -- FULL SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR BY CAROL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I THINK IS THE FIRST YEAR MAYBE FIVE YEARS. NOT HERE TALKING ABOUT FINES AND FEES -- BUT WHICH IS A GOOD THING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT -- BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR ALL THREE PROPOSALS -- WITHOUT LAWYERS OUR CLIENTS DON'T GET THE PROTECTION THEY NEED THEY DON'T GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. AND OUR STATE WILL BE A LESSER PLACE WITHOUT THAT SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ALL THREE PROPOSALS. SUZANNE AND IF A CHILDREN NOW HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE AUGMENTATION WERE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE GET THE REPRESENTATION THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU.

I KNOW IN SAN DIEGO THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DOES -- OUTPOURING OF APPRECIATION LAST YEAR WHEN THEY SAW THE BUDGET NAY WERE EVERYWHERE I WENT I WAS ONE OF WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW I REALIZE OKAY AS WE DID DO SOMETHING DECENT AND GOOD -- BUT I THINK WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT HOW CAN WE HELP YOUNG PEOPLE DEAL WITH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AS IT IS ONE OF THE WAYS OF COURSE IS TO HELP THEM TO AVOID. THE PITFALLS OF IT AND TO NOT BECOME A PART OF THE WORST PART OF THAT SYSTEM. BUT TO FIGURE OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN HELP THEM TO BUILD THEMSELVES UP AND I KNOW LEGALLY DOES A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS FOR THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT POOR COMMUNITIES -- IT DOES AN AMAZING JOB IN HELPING OF FOLKS DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND IS REALLY THE ONLY PLACE FOR THEM TO GO AND I KNOW. WE WE WERE FOR A LOT OF THEM TO THEM AND OFFICE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY A HELP IF THEY HAVE WITHIN NOT DEALING WITH THE A CRIMINAL ISSUE AND HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER BUT OF SOME OF THE OTHER THE REAL ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN LIFE.
