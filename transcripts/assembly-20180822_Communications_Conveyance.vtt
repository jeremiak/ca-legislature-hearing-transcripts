SP THE TWENTY TWO DOES EXACTLY

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:35.185
THE SAME THING.

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:37.487
THE FCC LOOKED AT PLANTS WHERE

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:48.098

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:50.801
BUT THEN THE FCC FLAG TO

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.669

AND SAID THAT THAT WOULD VIOLATE

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:09.186
THAT RULE SP TWENTY TWO DOES

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:12.222
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.156
ON INTERCONNECTION AGAIN YOU'VE

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.858
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS.

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:16.727
BUT EXPLICITLY SAY THE FCC ORDER

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.829
DID COVER INTERCONNECTION.

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.831
WHAT IT SAID WAS THAT WHEN YOU

INTERNET AND TO BRING THOSE

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.939
WEBPAGES CONTENT BACK?

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.307
TO THE PART OF THAT TRANSPORT

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:31.575
THAT'S ON THEIR NETWORK IS WERE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:32.709
THE NO BLOCKING OR THROTTLING

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.344
RULES APPLY.

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.480
BUT THE PROMISE GOES BEYOND THAT

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.247
IT GOES TO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:38.015
GO ON THE INTERNET.

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.383
AND INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS A

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:41.018
CRUCIAL PART OF THAT.

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:43.120
SO THE FCC SAID.

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:45.289
IF INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:46.890

OR THROTTLING.

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.394
THAT THAT WOULD ALSO BE

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.896
PROHIBITED UNDER THE ORDER.

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.631

SO AS LONG AS THERE'S BEEN A

LABOR MOVEMENT HAS BEEN

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.020

EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND THE

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.090
SAD REALITY IS THAT SOMETHING

FOUGHT.

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.213
THAT DRIVE TO FIGHTER BILLION

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.148
COMMUNICATE CONTINUES RIGHT NOW

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.349
THERE'S AN APP CALLED WORK IT

THAT A LOT OF WALMART EMPLOYEES

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.286
USE AND TOM.

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:10.353
WALMARTS AS A LOT OF TIME AND

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.621
MONEY TRYING TO KEEP WORKERS

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.023
FROM DOWNLOADING IT --

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:15.825
AS WE SPEAK THE NLRB IS MOVING

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.827
TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO PROHIBIT

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.362
WORKERS FROM COMMUNICATING OVER

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.564
EMAIL --

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.532
DURING OVER WORK EMAIL DURING

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:25.268
NON WORK HOURS AND SO THIS IT'S

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:26.736
SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS AN

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.438
ISSUE AND YOU KNOW WILL BE AN

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:29.573
ISSUE AS LONG AS THERE'S A LABOR

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.541
MOVEMENT AND OVER ARCHING ALL OF

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:34.544
THIS NOW IS NET NEUTRALITY WHICH

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.845
IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO CUTE WAS

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:36.546
BECAUSE SO.

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.281
MUCH OF THIS ORGANIZING HAPPENS

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.884
ONLINE NOWADAYS AND WITHOUT

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.252
SENATE BILL.

EIGHT TWENTY TWO IT'S PRETTY

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:43.787
SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.355
WORLD COULD LOOK LIKE ARM

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:47.290
WITHOUT THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.758
ESPECIALLY FOR WORKERS IN THE

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.160
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY.

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.962
WHERE IT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONALLY

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:53.830
EASY FOR AN EMPLOYER TO SLOW

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.699
DOWN OR BLOCK THE ABILITY TO

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:58.401
COMMUNICATE ONLINE ALL TOGETHER?

00:53:58.468 --> 00:53:58.969
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:01.037
ACTUALLY HAPPENED A WIN TELESAT

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.772
WORKERS THAT WERE ORGANIZING.

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:03.707
THEY DIRECTLY BLOCKED WORKERS

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.241
ACCESS TO WEBSITE THAT THEY WERE

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:07.143
USING AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.345
THING THAT WE CAN PROBABLY

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.680
EXPECT MORE OF IF WE KEEP GOING

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:11.348
INTO A WORLD WITHOUT NET

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.248
NEUTRALITY.

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:14.818
AND WHEN YOU PILE THAT ON TO ALL

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:15.385

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:15.952
FACING.

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.754

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:30.967
OF OUR ONLY HOPE FOR SURVIVAL

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.135

WHEELER I QUOTE.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.875
WE WERE QUITE SPECIFIC IN THE

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.910
OPEN INTERNET ORDER SAYING WE

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.745
WEREN'T GOING TO ADDRESS ZERO

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:52.481
RATING BECAUSE WE COULD ARGUE IT

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.617
BOTH WAYS AND OF QUOTE.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.152
AND JUST LAST YEAR BY THE WAY I

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.420
WAS BROUGHT UP HERE EARLIER THE

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:58.654
EUROPEAN UNION.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.989
AS WELL AS ONE OF THE LAST

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.524

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.893
EUROPEAN UNION CONCLUDED QUOTE

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.261
THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:06.996
REASON TO BELIEVE.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.098
THAT ZERO RATING.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.867
GIVES YOU A RISE TO COMPETITIVE

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:14.303
CONCERNS UNQUOTE.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.771
THE SECOND BIG ISSUE IN THIS

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:16.305
BILL THAT WE OBJECT TO IS

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.807
INTERCONNECTION.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.209
THE FCC ORDER DID NOT APPLY NET

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:20.643
NEUTRALITY RULES TO

PARAGRAPH THIRTY OF THE FCC

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.216
ORDER QUOTE THIS ORDER DOES NOT

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.518
APPLY OPEN INTERNET RULES TO

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:31.220
INNER CONNECTION UNQUOTE.

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.090
ON PAGE NINETY TWO PARAGRAPH TWO

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.624
OH TO WE CONCLUDE IT WOULD BE

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.394
PREMATURE. TO ADOPT PRESCRIPTIVE

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.629
RULES TO ADDRESS ANY PROBLEMS

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.164
THAT EVER RISEN OR MAY ARISE AND

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:43.966
OF QUOTE.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.634
THE INDUSTRY HAS COMPLIED WITH

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.969
THE OBAMA RULES THAT WERE

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.405
ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.706
AND CONTINUED IN PLACE THROUGH

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:51.307
THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.743
AND EIGHTEEN THE INDUSTRY DID

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.378
NOT CHANGE INTERCONNECTION

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.045
AGREEMENTS.

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.881
DURING THAT TIME. TO SUGGEST

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.082
THAT THE OBAMA RULES PROHIBITED

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.685
CHARGING FOR INTERCONNECTION

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:05.921
WITH AGE PROVIDERS IS NOT TRUE.

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:07.223
S. B. A TWENTY TWO IS A RADICAL

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.225
DEPARTURE FROM THE HISTORICALLY

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.493
SUCCESSFUL INTERNET POLICY

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.094
THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE.

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.629
SINCE THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:17.500
ADOPTED LIKE TOUCH REGULATION IN.

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:18.033
NINETEEN NINETY SIX LET ME

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.602
CONCLUDE BY SUGGESTING THIS WE

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:20.136
BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ANTI

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.404
COMPETITIVE.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.506
AND AND I CONSUMER AND IS SURELY

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.540
GOING TO BE CHALLENGED UNDER

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.475
FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:27.343
IT WILL DRIVE UP YOUR

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.277
CONSTITUENTS BILLS FOR INTERNET

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.478
SERVICE.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.380
IT WILL PROHIBIT POPULAR FREE

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.982
DATA PROGRAMS A CONSUMERS ENJOY

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.484
OVER THEIR WIRELESS PROGRAMS.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.752
AND WE BELIEVE IT'LL INCREASE

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.721
LITIGATION COSTS.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:39.889
AND THE QUESTION I HOPE THE

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.056
COMMITTEE WILL ASK FOR WHAT

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.359
BENEFIT.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.060
S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS BUILT

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:48.264
UPON SPECULATION THAT SOMEBODY.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:51.434
SOMEWHERE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.668
MIGHT VOLATILE VIOLATE NET

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.671
NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.406
TODAY THE NET NEUTRALITY

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:58.808
PRINCIPLES ARE ENFORCEABLE BY

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:00.342
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.911
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:04.246
THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS.

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:05.648
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL CREATE

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:06.615
A REGULATORY [inaudible]

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.051
A COMPLIANCE AND A LITIGATION

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.820
ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL HARM

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:12.621
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.857
ACTUALLY WEAKEN CALIFORNIA'S

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.724
LEADERSHIP.

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.660
IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:18.527
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:22.731

SUPPORT AND OPEN INTERNET AND WE

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.080
ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF NET

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.014
NEUTRALITY.

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.716
THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.117
BRIGHT LINE PRINCIPLES.

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:44.453
BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUT

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.455
WHILE WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.257
TO THESE ROLES IT IS IN PART

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.992
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE STATE IS

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.427
STEPPING BEYOND.

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.195
THEIR LEGAL JURISDICTION AND

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.764
THAT SPACE.

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:58.200
WE BELIEVE FIRST OF ALL THAT HAD

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.969
THE STATE IS PREEMPTED OF THE

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.637
INTERNET IS IN FACT I'M IN

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:03.839
INTERSTATE SERVICE AND IS

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:04.807
SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:06.175
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.677
BOTH THE FCC UNDER PRESIDENT

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:11.213
OBAMA AND THE CURRENT FCC HAVE

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.715
ALSO A PARTICULARLY THAT THEIR

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.283
INTENT TO PREEMPT THE STATES IN

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.484
THIS SPACE.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.720
AND WHILE SAID WHILE AT CHAIRMAN

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.956
WIENER IS OFTEN CITED AS THE AB

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.258
PRINCIPLE SUPPORTER OF THIS

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:25.361
LEGISLATION NOTING THAT STATE

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:27.196
LEGISLATION IS APPROPRIATE.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.365
I'D LIKE TO QUOTE FROM AB THE

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.966
FROM CHAIRMAN LEGAL AIR AS

RECENTLY AS THIS MONTH WHERE HE

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:33.636
WROTE.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.872
IN A PAPER TITLED TIME TO FIX IT

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.474
DEVELOPING RULES FOR THE

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.175
INTERNET CAPITALISM.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:42.344
AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.812
NATION IN WHICH THE INTERNET IS

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.481
OBLIVIOUS TO STATE BOUNDARIES A

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.383
LACK OF UNIFORMITY BETWEEN

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:49.652
STATES CAN IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.520
BE AT BURDENS AND UNCERTAINTIES

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.822
I'M COMPANIES THAT IS OUR

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.192
CONCERN HERE TODAY ABOUT HAVING

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:58.627
STATE BY STATE LEGISLATION.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.130
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL RESULT

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.765
IN THE AYE NOT ONLY SIGNIFICANT

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:04.199
OPERATIONAL BURDENS THAT WILL

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.569
POTENTIALLY UPSET THE OPERATION

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:07.870
OF THE INTERNET.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:08.537
BUT INSIGNIFICANT LEGAL

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:11.807
CHALLENGES I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.809
DIRECTLY TO SOME OF THE CLAIMS

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.444
OF THE THAT THE PROPONENTS HAVE

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:16.111
MADE WITH REGARDS TO

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.980
INTERCONNECTION.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.249
I'M THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.317
INTERCONNECTION IS NOT BEING

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.052
PROHIBIT.

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.320
BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL WAS

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:27.022
SPECIFIC TO PROHIBITING MONETARY

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.758
OR OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.460
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:33.696
THAT IN FACT GOES BEYOND ITS

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.930
POINTED OUT BY MISTER DEVINE

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.765
GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:37.566
ORDER.

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.101
BUT I WOULD ADD TO THAT THAT ICE

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.703
PIECE OF MADE BILLIONS OF

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.204
DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS WITH THE

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:44.206
UNDERSTANDING.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.041
THAT THE COST CAN BE RECOUPED.

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:48.010
S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WHICH

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.112
CHECKED ALL OF THOSE COSTS MANY

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.580
THAT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR DECADES

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.649
BY INTERCONNECTION PARTNERS. TWO

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.184
WHY S. P. CUSTOMERS YOUR

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.954
CONSTITUENTS.

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.022
THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.323
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BILL

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.959
INCLUDING A SAFE HARBOR.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.495
IF SENATOR WE ARE TRULY WANT IT

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.097
TO CREATE A SAFE HARBOR THEN THE

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.331
BILL WOULD NOT APPLY TO

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.033
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THAT

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.935
HAVE BEEN AND YET IN PLACE FOR

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:13.936
YEARS.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.904
AND DON'T APPLY ON A STATE BY

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.206
STATE BASIS.

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:20.643
BASICALLY WE ARE BEING ASKED TO

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:22.277
IMPOSE UP TO WITH ABBOTT TO

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.680
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT HERE

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:27.182
AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT IS GOING

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:29.251
TO UPS THAT CONTRACTS THAT GO

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:30.719
WELL BEYOND THE BORDERS OF

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:33.222
CALIFORNIA. TO THE EXTENT YOU

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:35.224

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.992
THAT PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.727
SOME CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.895
GIVEN TO SOME PRESCRIPTIVE

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.697

OPERATION OF THE INTERNET.

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:05.421
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.790
THIS BILL.

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:10.125

ZERO RATING DOES.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.996
IS IT REDUCES COMPETITION.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.499
WHICH DRIVES UP COSTS OVERTIME

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.702

VERIZON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.474
THINK THAT THAT'S A VERIZON --

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:08.844
SAYS -- BUT

AND STREAMING OF COURSE IS VERY

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.938
DATA INTENSIVE AND SO WHAT IT

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.940
DOES OVER TIME IT REDUCES

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.509
COMPETITION IT SQUEEZES THE

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.244
SMALLER AND MID SIZE COMPANIES.

REDUCED THAT OVER TIME RAISES

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.785
PRICES FOR CONSUMERS WE ALSO

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.454
KNOW BASED ON EXPERIENCES IN

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.522
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RESTRICTED

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:56.091
THIS KIND OF ABUSIVE ZERO RATING.

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.993
ANTICOMPETITIVE ZERO RATING ODD

01:19:58.059 --> 01:19:59.794
THAT WHEN ZERO RATING IS

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:00.829
RESTRICTED [inaudible]

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:03.798
THEN COST OF AN UNLIMITED DATA

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:05.901
PLAN COLLAPSES GO DOWN

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.502
DRAMATICALLY SO THAT'S A SAVINGS

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.904
FOR CONSUMER.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:11.740
AND DATA CAPS GO UP SO CONSUMERS

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.475
GET MORE DATA FOR THE SAME PRICE

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.377
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS ZERO

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.479
RATING SO CALLED PRE DATA PLANS

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.413
WHERE THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.048
OFF THOSE PLANS FRANK ABOUT IS

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.850
GIVING AWAY FREE DATA SORT OF A

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:22.784
MISNOMER.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:23.985
THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.253
OFF OF THOSE QUORUM CORPORATE

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.354
DATA PLANS.

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:29.124
I PRUDENT PLANS HAVE VALUE ZERO

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.293
RATING HAS VALUE ONLY IF DATA

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.261
CAPS ARE KEPT LOW.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.529
IF YOU MAKE IT EASY FOR WORKING

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.298
CLASS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.266
BUY UNLIMITED OR HIGH DATA CUT

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.301
PLANS IF YOU MAKE IT AN

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.536
EXPENSIVE. ZERO RATING HAS NO

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.705
VALUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THE

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:44.306
DATA YOU NEED TO GO WHERE EVER

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.340
YOU GO.

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.242
CAN ONLY HAS VALUE WHEN THEY

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.444
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MIDDLE

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.313
INCOME LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO BUY

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.948
UNLIMITED DATA PLANS.

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:53.949
AND WHERE THEY HAVE LOW DATA

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.251
CUTS SO ZERO RATING IS INTENSELY

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:57.752
ANTI CONSUMER.

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:59.387
IT REDUCES CONSUMER CHOICE A

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:01.523
REDUCES COMPETITION WHICH RAISES

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.725
PRICES I WANNA COMPANY IF A

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.760
NETFLIX IS PAYING A TON OF MONEY

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.062
TO BE ZERO RATED.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.430
WHERE IS WHERE THEY PASSING THAT

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.731
THROUGH?

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.666
THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA END UP

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.768
PAYING MORE BUT IN THE END WHAT

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:15.237
THIS BILL IS A BALLOT AND WHAT

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:16.204
ZERO RATING IN PARTICULAR IS

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.540
ABOUT IS AVOIDING --

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.908

CAPITALIZATION OF THE INTERNET.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.682
I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY USED TO

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:28.617
GOING ONTO THE INTERNET I'M

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.785

NOT BEING LIMITED WE ARE HEADED

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:34.422
TOWARDS A REGIME IN ZERO RATING

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:35.890
IS AT THE HEART OF THIS.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.592
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PUSH

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.427
IN THE PLANS WHERE OKAY THIS IS

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.396

AYE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE --

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:51.373
AND JONES SAWYER MENTIONED THIS

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.742
TO ME IV ISSUE OF WHEN --

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.443

THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:02.684
TOWARDS WITH A COMBINATION OF

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.486
LACK OF THE BLOCKING RULES.

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:06.855
I AND ZERO RATING OUGHT THAT WE

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.090
CAN'T DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:10.725
WHERE WE WANNA GO WE'RE BEING

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.827
TOLD AND MANIPULATED AND ZERO

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.996
RATING IS AT THE HEART OF THAT.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.498
LET ME JUST JUMP IN AND IF THE

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.099
VICE CHAIR AND WEAK NEEDS ANY

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.502
FURTHER OF OUR QUESTIONS.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:22.404
IT'S PROBABLY.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:23.305
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE ANSWER

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.440
TO THE QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW I I

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.075
HAVE.

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:27.842
TO OBJECT TO THE

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:28.810
CHARACTERIZATION OF ZERO RATINGS

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.545
ANTI COMPETITIVE.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.147
A I MEAN IF YOU.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.915
IF YOU USE THAT GENERALIZATION

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.650
THEM LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS ARE

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.152
AT A COMPETITIVE I MEAN IF YOU.

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.120
IF YOU BUY A TICKET TO GOLDEN

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.722
ONE CENTER AND YOU GO WATCH A

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.357
BASKETBALL GAME AND YOU SEE AN

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:43.224
ADVERTISEMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.060
ARENA.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:45.994
YOU KNOW BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:46.961
WELL THAT'S ANTI COMPETITIVE THE

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:47.962
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:49.197
BECAUSE THAT DISADVANTAGES THE

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.265
PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.533
FOR THE ADVERTISING MEN I THINK

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:52.534
IT'S UNDERSTOOD.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.235
AS A CONSUMER THAT THE VALUE OF

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:55.970
THAT ADVERTISING.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:56.771
IS SUBSIDIZING THE TICKET PRICE

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.473
THAT YOU'RE PAYING.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.075
THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.076
THE ARENA AND THE TEAM ARE ARE

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.677
DAUNTING.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:04.179
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S THE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.347
PURVIEW OF GOVERNMENT TO GET IN

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:07.015
THE WAY OF THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.083
YOU'RE GONNA TELL A NETFLIX

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.484
CUSTOMER.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.051
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:12.187
WATCH NETFLIX.

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.489
WITHOUT EFFECTING THEIR DID THE

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.390
USING THE DATA UNDERNEATH OR

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:16.725
DATA CAP.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.026
YEAH I MEAN IF IF YOU WANT TO

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.662
START A A MOBILE PHONE COMPANY

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.164
AND OFFER HIGHER DATA PLANS OF

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.232
YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.500
NOTHING TO BE GREAT BUT I MEAN

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:26.434
THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.203
THAT THESE COMPANIES ALL COMPETE

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:29.738
IN A COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE.

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.240
AND I AM THE THE AYE AYE WE ARE

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:33.875
INFERIORS AGREEMENT THAT.

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.009
WHAT THE MARKET REALLY NEEDS IS

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.177
MORE COMPETITION BECAUSE MORE

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:38.179
COMPETITION CLARIFIES A LOT OF

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.614
DIFFERENT ASPECTS AND IN

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.149
PARTICULAR FAIR PRICING?

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:42.083
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.618
HARD TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.687
I'M THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT I

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:46.221
HAVE WITH THE BAN ON ZERO

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.355
RATINGS THIS.

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:48.623
AND IT GOES BACK TO THE STUDY

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.225
THAT THAT I EIGHTEEN TI WAS

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.026
REFERENCING IT ENOUGH A IF YOU

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:52.627
HAVEN'T READ THE STUDY ANYONE

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.596
THAT HASN'T HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.697
TO ITS ITS EYE OPENING.

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.632
UP AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SAYS IS

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.667
THAT FOR THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER.

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:00.735
YOU WILL COST THEM THIRTY TO

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.404
FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:05.106
BY TAKING AWAY ZERO RATING BUT

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.341
AT THERE AND THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:08.076
BUT WHAT'S REALLY EYE OPENING IS

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.711
THE FACT THAT A THIRD OF LOW

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.246
INCOME CUSTOMERS.

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.515
USE ONLY THEIR MOBILE PHONES. TO

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.617
ACCESS THE INTERNET.

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.085
AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE YOU WILL

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.720
COST THEM HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.021
YEAR THAT'S HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:20.955
THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.724
AND THIS GETS INTO SOMETHING

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.292
THAT I'M GET REALLY EMOTIONAL

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.093
THAT WHICH IS THE DECISIONS THAT

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:25.727
WE MAKE.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.362
IN THIS BUILDING.

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.329
THAT RAISE THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.798
CALIFORNIA.

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:31.332
THE I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.000
AWARE WE HAVE THE WORST POVERTY

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.735
OF ANY STATE THE COUNTRY HERE.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:34.335
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:35.637

NATIONAL CONTRACTS FOR ALL

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:41.929
CONTENT ON THE INTERNET AND THAT

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.098
HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL SINCE THE

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.867
BEGINNING OF THE INTERNET.

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:46.767
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RADICAL

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.836
CHANGE.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.705
BUILT INTO THIS LEGISLATION AND

INCLUDED PREEMPTION LANGUAGE AND

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.454
YOU DO NOT LOSE YOUR AUTHORITY

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.023
TO ASSERT PREEMPTION BECAUSE YOU

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.025
PURSUE A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:11.726
MODEL.

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.094
INSTEAD OF A HEAVY TOUCH

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.897
REGULATORY MY SO PREEMPTION IS

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.798
THERE BOTH DEMOCRAT AND

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:20.401
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.402
HAVE INCLUDED THAT IN THEIR

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:22.203
ORDERS SO THE VERY BIPARTISAN

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:26.307
ISSUE.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.541
THEY'RE GETTING MISTER PATTERSON

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:34.081
HAD AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION --

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:37.618
YEAH UP.

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.086
I'D THEN I'D I HAVE TO THINK

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.956
LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS --

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.090
AND MOST THE MEMBERS KNOW THAT I

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:44.892
COME FROM A LONG.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.193
A HISTORY OF BROADCAST

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.995
EXPERIENCE.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.096
AND WITH LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:49.630
THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.499
COMMISSION.

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:54.568
AND WHAT IS TROUBLING ME.

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.504
OF THE MOST HERE.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:33:00.408
I IS WITH RESPECT. TO FIFTY

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:02.476
DIFFERENT STATES.

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:05.880
ENGAGING IN A PATCHWORK.

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:08.449
I JUST THINK THAT IS INVITING A

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:10.484
LONG LONG SERIES.

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.820
OF LITIGATION A LONG LONG SERIES

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:15.089
OF OF HEARTACHE.

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:15.656
AND SO MEMBERS I THOUGHT YOU

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:18.626
KNOW I I REALLY THINK WE HAVE TO

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:19.994
THINK VERY VERY LONG AND HARD

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:22.263
ABOUT PASSING THIS BILL THROUGH.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.432
I THINK THERE IS CLEARLY A

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:25.266
FEDERAL ISSUE A JURISDICTION

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.234
HERE.

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.536
I THINK TO THINK OTHERWISE IS TO

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.504
SUGGEST THAT THE INTERNET.

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:32.606
IS NOT THE MOST DATA.

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:34.809
WRITTEN LARGE EXAMPLE OF

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.310
INTERSTATE COMMERCE THAT THE

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:38.212
UNITED STATES HAS.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.480
SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:40.414
ABOUT THIS AND IN MAKING THE

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.350
DECISIONS THAT WERE.

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.384
I THINK THIS GUY CREATES MEANT

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.685
THAT.

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:45.386
SERIOUS UNCERTAINTY IN

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.989
CALIFORNIA. FOR A LONG LONG TIME

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.623
BUT I THINK.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.359
RATHER THAN HELP THE INTERNET IS

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:52.693
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO TOUR

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.662
INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:55.696
HERE'S MY BIGGER CAN BUT BIGGEST

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.031
CONCERN.

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.500
APART FROM THE PREEMPTION AND

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:00.267
APART FROM SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:00.568
[inaudible]

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:02.870
FACTORS.

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.205
WHAT IF WERE NOT CAREFUL WEEK WE

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:05.606
ARE GOING?

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:07.908
TO CREATIVE OUR STATE.

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:12.213
AN ISLAND OF ITS OWN REGULATIONS.

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:13.914
THAT IS GOING TO PENALIZE OUR

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:17.118
INTERNET USERS AND OUR

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.719

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:21.222
STRUGGLING WITH.

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.357
THE NECESSITY.

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:25.826
FOR CALIFORNIA'S REACTION TO A

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:27.828
MORE FREE AND COMPETITIVE

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:30.231

REALLY HARD AND LISTEN TO BOTH

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:36.203
SIDES.

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:37.104
BUT THE FACTS ARE REALLY SELF

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:39.040
EVIDENT.

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:41.509
UNDER LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION.

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:43.344

MOST OF SENATOR I JUST A

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:49.877
QUESTION AS RELATES TO THE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.879
TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:53.447
AND THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT THE

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.583
CONTRACTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:57.551
TIME AND HOW THOSE CONTRACTS

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.320
THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.322
EXPOSURE.

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.557
FOR THOSE ARE RELATIONSHIPS THAT

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:05.960
ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND HAS

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:08.896
THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION. TO

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.298
AN INLAND IMPLEMENTATION DATE.

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:12.533
THAT WOULD --

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.901
COINCIDE OR CREATE A BETTER

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.669
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE CONTRACTS

A IF THERE THE CONTRACTUAL

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.214
ARRANGEMENT THE THIRD GOES

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:29.483
TOWARD THE END OF NEXT YEAR --

THE BILL AT PLEASE GONNA BE

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:31.719
CORRECTIVE ARMAND I DON'T

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.354
BELIEVE OVERRIDES THAT IT WOULD

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:36.423
BE FOR THE ENTER ENTRY INTO NEW.

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:40.895

SO THE BUT IT.

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:50.004
SO I WOULD SAY FIRST.

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.572
THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.207
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS AS

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:55.142
SUCH IT JUST BRINGS BACK THE

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.510
PART OF THE F. C. C.'S REGIME

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:59.079

CONNECTION PRACTICES AND IT SAYS

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.051
VERY EXPLICITLY THAT.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.953
INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THAT

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.922
DO NOT EVADE THE BILL SENATE

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.323
NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS.

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:11.091
ARE NOT A PROBLEM.

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:14.728
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE FCC

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.664

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.032

ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO HEAR

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:25.072
DISPUTES REGARDING ARRANGEMENTS

A MISTER WE KNOW THE AUTHOR OR

01:47:36.183 --> 01:47:37.684

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:38.919
IT'S JUST A COMMENT IN GENERAL.

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:41.087

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:52.572
COMMITTEE MEMBERS BOTH.

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.474
THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE AND

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:55.108
THOSE WHO ARE NOT FOR THE VERY

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:55.909
THOUGHTFUL.

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:59.079
OUR DISCUSSION TODAY ARE WE ARE

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:01.014
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID BEFORE I

01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:02.215
REALLY WISH.

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.217
I THAT I COULD USE THIS BILL FOR

01:52:04.284 --> 01:52:06.786
SOMETHING ELSE ANA AND I WISH

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.755
THAT WE HAD A FEDERAL PROTECTION

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:09.923
TO PLACE.

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:12.225
ARE BY WHAT HAPPENED DIE IN

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:13.526
DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THAT TOOK

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:15.195
EFFECT IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WAS

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:17.831
NOT JUST THE REPEAL OF THE

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:18.431
TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER.

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:19.833
IT WAS BASICALLY THE APPEAL

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:22.068
REPEAL OF I THINK ABOUT FIFTEEN

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:25.972
YEARS WORTH OF FCC RULES ARE ON

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:27.373
THAT NEUTRALITY BECAUSE TWENTY

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.775
FIFTEEN WAS NOT THE BEGINNING --

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:29.943
THERE WERE RULES IN PLACE BEFORE

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.845
IT WAS ALL WHITE TO WHITE.

01:52:31.911 --> 01:52:33.346
SO RIGHT NOW IT IS EFFECTIVELY

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:35.315
IMPOSSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:36.916
ENFORCE NET NEUTRALITY BECAUSE

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:38.618
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.019
NOT AN EFFECTIVE VENUE IT'S A

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:41.621
GREAT AGENCY BUT ON THIS ISSUE

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.056
IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:43.223
IT.

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:44.991
AYE AND SO WITHOUT THE STATE'S

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:46.192
STEPPING IN AND WE'RE NOT THE

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:48.595
FIRST. THREE STATES HAVE ALREADY

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.296
PASSED NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIVE

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:51.698
LAWS ARE GOVERNORS HAVE ISSUED

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:54.100
EXECUTIVE ORDERS SO IN TERMS OF

01:52:54.167 --> 01:53:04.177
THE PATCHWORK YOU KNOW WHICH

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:04.777
WHICH THE ISPS CREATED BY.

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:05.411
AND BY IN GETTING RID OF THE

01:53:05.478 --> 01:53:05.945
FEDERAL PROTECTION THAT

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:06.412
PATCHWORK HAS BEGUN.

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:07.046
I AND I YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:07.747
THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IS

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:08.381
THE STATE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:08.848

TO THEM THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:34.179
PUBLIC SAFETY IS AT THE BIG ONE

02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:35.781
A SILLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ.

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:37.249
AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:37.983
IS GONNA MAKE THAT WAY MORE

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.885
COMPLICATED --

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.820
IT CHALLENGE THE ABILITY TO

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.500
WITH THE INTERNET.

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:55.667
HOW WAS A CONTRACTOR GONNA KNOW

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:57.302
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO SO WE

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:58.370
THINK THAT'S GOING TO CREATE

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:00.039
ENORMOUS CONFUSION --

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:01.340
IT'S GONNA GO WELL BEYOND EVEN

02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:04.009

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.738
YOU WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS BEING

THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT --

THE LANGUAGE MEANS SO THAT'S

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:47.586
GOING TO HAVE TO BE RESOLVED.

IT'S IT'S CREATING A SYSTEM THAT

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:58.797

THING THEY WERE DOING IT THIS IS

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:32.210
WHAT THE STATES HAVE BEEN DOING.

02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:34.946
A SINCE THE TRUMP FCC GOT RID OF

I UNDERSTAND.

02:12:38.483 --> 02:12:39.217
IF THIS WAS AN INCREMENTAL STEP.

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:40.686
SO FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible]

02:12:40.752 --> 02:12:42.487
WE'RE SAYING.

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:43.922
THE PUBLIC CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:46.258

02:12:53.565 --> 02:12:55.834
WERE SAYING EVERYBODY MUST ABIDE

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:57.002

LEGISLATION.

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.504

SERVICE TO THE STATE MUST ABIDE

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.308
AND THAT THAT'S WHY JUDGES DON'T
