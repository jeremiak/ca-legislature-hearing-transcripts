THANK YOU.

FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT.

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.377
SB.

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.578
THREE THIRTY AND I THINK WE ALL

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:55.947
AGREE THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.882
RIGHT AND UNFORTUNATELY.

00:26:57.949 --> 00:26:59.751
IN CALIFORNIA IT'S INCREASINGLY

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.152
A RIGHT THAT.

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:03.421
MANY MANY PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:06.725
MANY PEOPLE OF LOST AND I WE

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.260
HAVE A SERIES HOUSING CRISIS --

00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:11.663
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE COST.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.099
OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:16.368
IT EXCEEDS BASICALLY ALMOST

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:18.937
EVERYWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:20.572
BUT UNFORTUNATELY PART OF THE

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:22.440
REASON THAT OUR COSTS ARE SO

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:26.011
HIGH IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:28.713
PROVIDED THE NUMBER OF UNITS

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.415
THAT WE NEED FOR OUR POPULATION.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:33.051
WE ARE THE SECOND LOWEST IN THE

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.786
STATE.

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:37.155
OF NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS PER

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:41.126
PERSON OF ANYWHERE IN THE US.

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:41.726
FORTY NINE THEN HOUSING UNITS

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.694
PER CAPITA.

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:45.997
SCARCITY INCREASES COST.

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:47.532
AND THAT COST THEN.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.666
HAS CAUSED HOMELESSNESS

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.268
ADDITIONALLY.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.303
SO WE KNOW WE'RE IN A CRISIS IN

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.638
MY BILL.

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.840
WAS DESIGNED REALLY TO ADDRESS

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:58.343
THAT CRISIS AND WHILE I SAY THAT

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.879
IT WAS TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS IT

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:02.313
IS ALSO A MODEST BILL.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.149
BECAUSE IT STARTS FROM THE

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.817
PREMISE THAT.

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:08.453
WHILE I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.321
SEE INCREASED DENSITY IN VARIOUS

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.791
PLACES.

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.426
IT STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT.

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:18.029
ARE EXISTING ZONING RULES IN OUR

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.531
IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:20.965
THE STATE.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.268
HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.537
CONCEPTUALLY.

00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:26.371
THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS WE

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.272
NEED.

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:28.573
NOW YOU KNOW SOMEONE COULD

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.608
QUIBBLE LITTLE BUT BASICALLY.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.043
ON THE BOOKS.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.646
ARE CONCEPTUALLY A GREAT NUMBER

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.181
OF HOUSING UNITS THEY HAVEN'T

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.282
BEEN BUILT YET.

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:38.983
SO WHAT IS MY BILL DO IT

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.453
RESPECTS THE EXISTING LOCAL

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.855
ZONING BUT IT SAYS LOCAL

00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:46.291
GOVERNMENTS JOIN WITH US.

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:48.626
AND GIVE THE HOUSING APPLICANTS

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.361
SOME CERTAINTY.

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:52.764
AND PROCESS THEIR PERMIT IN A

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:53.998
SPECIFIC TIME.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.835
AND DON'T CHANGE THE RULES WHEN

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.303
YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.971
PROCESSING THAT PERMIT.

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:03.441
AND THAT WAY WE COULD ACTUALIZED.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.409
THE HOUSING THAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:06.344
CONCEPTUALLY APPROVED ON THE

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:09.814
BOOKS SO THAT'S REALLY THE VERY

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:10.949
CORE OF THIS BILL.

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:14.586
IT'S BEEN MYTHOLOGIZED.

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:15.553
YES.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.588
VERY SENT TO TEASE HAVE TRIED TO

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:18.323
CHARACTERIZE IT IS SOMETHING IT

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.290
IS NOT.

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:22.327
IT IS REALLY ABOUT JUST GIVING

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.496
CERTAINTY TO THOSE PROJECTS

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.230
WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.899
CONCEPTUALLY SETTER OKAY SO THAT

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:30.368
WHEN AN APPLICANT COMES IN.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.504
WITH SOMETHING THAT MEETS YOUR

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.138
RULES.

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:35.140
MEET YOUR EXISTING DESIGN REVIEW

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:37.275
STANDARDS MEETS EVERYTHING YOU

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.009
WOULD -- ASKED.

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:40.211
THAT THEN YOU DON'T CHANGE THE

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.546
RULES MIDSTREAM.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.014
YOU DON'T INCREASE THEIR FEES

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.816
WHILE THAT APPLICANT IS IN

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.451
PROCESS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.286
ON THE FEES PARK.

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:49.387
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SO FEARFUL

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.023
HORSE FOR TO COVER ALL THE FEES

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.057
NO.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:55.426
JUST FREEZES THE FEES FOR THAT

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:56.961
APPLICATION WHILE THAT

00:29:57.028 --> 00:30:01.466
APPLICANTS PERMIT IS BEING

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:02.534
PROCESSED.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.601
AND THE BILL WAS BASED ON WHAT

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.336
SANTA ROSA DID AFTER THE COFFEE

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:06.404
FIRE.

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.506
IN SANTA ROSA LOST HOW MANY

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:09.974
UNITS I DON'T REMEMBER IT CALLED

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.310
EXACT NUMBER BUT WAS OVER

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:13.077
THOUSAND UNITS I THINK WAS IN

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:14.979
THE ORDER OF IT WAS MORE AND

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.114
THREE THOUSAND UNITS.

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:18.049
AND THEY KNEW THAT THE NEEDED TO

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.484
HELP PEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:20.885
HOMES.

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:22.487
SO THEY LOOKED AT THEIR OWN

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:24.322
PERMIT PROCESS.

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.089
AND THEY LOOKED AT HOW TO

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.624
STREAMLINE IT AND HOW TO HELP

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:27.825
PEOPLE.

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.827
GET BACK WITH WHAT THEY HAD

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:31.262
ALREADY AGREED.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.164

OF LOCUM HOUSING PROJECTS.

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:53.711
WE ARE SEEING PROJECTS COME IN

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:55.213
AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.180

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.515
NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.384
PER UNIT TO BUILD IN THESE.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.251

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

FOUND LAST YEAR THEIR NATIONWIDE

AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.861
AND SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.562
POINT TO BRING UP BECAUSE AS YOU

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.240
AND SO OUR WORK HAS SHOWN AT

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:23.841
THESE COSTS ARE DRIVEN BY A

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.243
VARIETY OF FACTORS BUT CHIEF

IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS THAT

WE BUILD EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.115
VERY LOW INCOME MIDDLE INCOME

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.350
HOUSING -- IN THAT CONTEXT I

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.753
THINK WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT.

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.755
TO RAISE OUR OVER ARCHING

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:52.556
CONCERNS WHICH COULD BE --

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.824
DESCRIBE MOST SIMPLY AS I THINK

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.093
SOCIAL JUSTICE CONCERNS WITH

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.495
THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY ARE

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.530
POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED IMPACTS

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.098
FROM THE BILL WHICH WE WOULD.

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:02.399
BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.235
WITH THE AUTHOR ON THESE

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:05.870
CONCERNS FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:09.707
I THINK THAT -- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.909
LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT PROMOTE.

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.811
VERY MUCH AN EQUITY FIRST LANDS

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.379
THAT IS WANTING TO MAKE SURE

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:16.981
THAT AS WE SPEED UP THINGS LIKE

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:18.883
OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION DURING

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.351
THIS CRISIS WHICH WE KNOW WE

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:21.952
NEED TO DO WE ARE VERY MUCH --

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:23.754
FOR EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WE

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:25.089
ARE BUILDERS OURSELVES SO WE

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:25.956
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.258
INCLUDE OUR MOST VULNERABLE

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.626
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.361
MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ARE

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.630
PROSPEROUS AND STABILIZED THE

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:33.330
DURING THIS TIME OUR

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:35.232
NEIGHBORHOOD ALONE HAS ALREADY

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.401
LOST EIGHT THOUSAND LATINO

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.903
COMMUNITY MEMBERS RECENTLY.

00:40:38.969 --> 00:40:41.038
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.673
ARE FINDING.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.608
OUR WAY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:45.943
CULTURAL ECO SYSTEMS ARE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.245
PROTECTED AND SOMETIMES THAT IS

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:49.513
A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.382
AND IT ALLOWS THE VOICE OF THE

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.616
COMMUNITY TO BE HEARD AND IT

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:55.853
ALLOWS SOME DISCRETION ON BEHALF

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.754
OF OUR LOCAL LAND USE BOARDS.

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:57.822
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE

00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:59.290
ELEMENT TEAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.225
WE ARE STABILIZING OUR COMMUNITY

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.360
FIRST AND FOREMOST -- ALREADY WE

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.662
SEE THAT THIS BILL FROM OUR

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.363
UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE WOULD

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.832
DISRUPT.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.700
OUR LATINO CULTURAL DISTRICT

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.702
STILL WORKING AFTER HUNDREDS OF

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:14.138
HOURS BETWEEN CITY AND COMMUNITY

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.172
TO ESTABLISH ITS DESIGN

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:16.473
GUIDELINES SOME OF THOSE DESIGN

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.842
GUIDELINES WE UNDERSTAND WOULD

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.143
BE INVALIDATED.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.778
BY THIS PROPOSAL SIMILARLY WE

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.012
UNDERSTAND OUT OF LOS ANGELES

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.114
BECAUSE OF THE JANUARY FIRST

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:26.050
RETROACTIVE TIMELINE THAT A

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.952
COMMUNITY AREA PLAN THEIR

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.553
SIMILARLY WOULD ALSO BE.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.623
DISRUPTED BY THIS PROCESS -- TO

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.626
TO NAME A COUPLE MORE PARTICULAR

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.194
CONCERNS OF PASSAGES.

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:38.495
WE CAN CURVE WITH THE FLAGGING

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.097
THAT WAS DONE IN THE SENATE

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:41.398
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE.

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:44.068
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:45.769
A SORT OF SPOT ZONING THAT SEEMS

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.571
TO BE ALLOWED BY LANGUAGE THAT

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:50.207
WE DETAILED IN OUR LETTER --

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:52.176
THAT SEEMS TO SAY YOU CAN DEFER

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.477
TO A GENERAL PLAN INSTEAD OF A

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:55.212
SPECIFIC ZONING IF YOU FEEL

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:57.481
SOMEHOW THAT ZONING IS NOT QUITE.

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:58.515
IN CONCORDANCE WITH THE

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:00.150
SURROUNDING TERRITORY BUT THAT

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:01.252
SOMETIMES CAN BE DONE FOR

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:03.621
REASONS OF CULTURAL ECO SYSTEM.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:05.122
AS WE MENTIONED LIMITING THE

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:07.825
NUMBER OF HEARINGS TO A TOTAL OF

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:08.859
FIVE WE THINK IS.

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.261
A WAY OF OF LIMITING ARE

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.762
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES VOICES

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.564
THAT'S ALREADY BEING OVERRUN BY

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:16.300
LARGE FORCES AND THIS IS ONE WAY

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.335
THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH OF

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:18.602
ELEMENT.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.137
I MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITY IS

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.639
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THEIR FUTURE

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.374
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.310
EXPANDED OR OVER ELIMINATED OR

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.878
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT WE

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:28.712
MAKE SURE WE STILL HAVE APPEALS

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:30.014
AS A POSSIBILITY RIGHT NOW YOU

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.282
COULD VERY WELL GO THROUGH A

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:32.449
PROCESS AS WE KNOW AND END.

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.551
UP WITH NO APPEALS WERE THERE TO

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:36.253
BE SOME ISSUES.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.187
WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S NEW

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.356
DEMOLITION LANGUAGE TODAY WE'D

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.457
LIKE TO REVIEW THAT.

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.926
OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WAS SQUARE

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.994
FOOTAGE LOSS AND ALSO THE

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.195
POTENTIAL FOR STATE DENSITY

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:47.031
BONUS INTERACTING WITH THIS AS

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.299
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:42:48.365 --> 00:42:50.401
AND FINALLY WE DO HAVE A CONCERN

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:51.235
THAT THERE COULD BE SOME ISSUE

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:52.069
WITH THIS.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:54.872
ASSESSING OF FEES AND IMPACT

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.373
FEES AT THE TIME OF THE PRE OP

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.975
WHERE THINGS ARE NOT CERTAIN YET

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.176
AND WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.711
COULD COULD WORK SO WE'D LIKE TO

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.146
LOOK INTO THAT WITH THE AUTHOR

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:05.649
OF POSSIBLE.

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.618
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:08.419
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:08.986
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:09.920
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FOR THOSE

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.355
THAT DON'T KNOW HF IS NOT ONLY

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.690
THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF CARE AND

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.824
TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH HIV IN

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:15.159
THE WORLD.

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.660
BUT IT ALSO HAS A GROWING PRETTY

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:18.195
SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING HOUSING

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.930
PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.066
ARE ALSO DEVELOPER OF HOUSING

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.534
FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE -- WE

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.569
REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:28.138
THE AUTHOR HAS DONE ON THIS BILL --

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:29.606
A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE --

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.875
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.143
AND WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE A

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.945
COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WE STILL

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.046
LIKE TO WORK OUT WITH HER AS THE

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:36.447
BILL.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.849
NOW MOVES FORWARD. ONE IS AS

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.783
MOST PAPADOPOULOS'S HAS

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.318
INDICATED HAVE HAS TO DO WITH

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.354
THE OPERATIVE DATE RELATIVE TO

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.089
GENERAL PLANS ON THAT DATE IS

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:48.058
STILL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:48.692
EIGHTEEN WE KNOW IT HAS LIMITED

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:51.128
IMPACT BUT IT DOES IMPACT IN LOS

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.529
ANGELES IN PARTICULAR.

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:55.032
A COMMUNITY PLAN THAT WAS

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:55.866
DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST ELEVEN

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.002
YEARS I'M WITH LEADERS FROM THE

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.903
SOUTH LA COMMUNITY -- THAT

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.071
DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.207
AFTER JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.241
EIGHTEEN WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:04.875
ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:05.943
HAVE IT WHETHER THIS BILL IS

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.144
GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.112
ABILITY OF THAT.

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:09.680
OF THAT TO A PLAN TO BE FULLY

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.015
REALIZED THE WAY PEOPLE

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:12.950
ANTICIPATED IT -- WE WELCOME THE

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:13.951
LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADDED TO THE

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:16.387
BILL RELATIVE TO DEMOLITION AND

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.655
WE THINK OVERALL IT'S A IT'S A

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:19.223
GOOD SECTION AND GOOD THAT

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:20.424
THEY'VE ADDED IT --

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.325
UNFORTUNATELY THERE COUPLE

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.659
THINGS IN THERE THAT WOULD STILL

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.228
LIKE TO SEE FIXED -- I KNOW THIS

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.229
IS RECENT LANGUAGE AND WE'RE

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:26.663
JUST NOW GETTING A CHANCE TO

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.066
RESPOND TO IT -- BUT WE ARE VERY

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:31.969
CONCERNED ABOUT -- UNDER

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.604
POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING THAT'S

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.005
NOT RIGHT THE THE RIGHT TERM BUT

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.940
IT IMPEDING THE ABILITY OF THE

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.078
THINK THIS POINT OF PART OF THE

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.379
STATE THAT REMAINS UNAFFECTED.

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.313

AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN --

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:11.088
OVER ALL THE COMMITTEES I THINK

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:11.989
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:13.557
HEAR I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.692
IMPORTANT BUT THIS AND I AND I

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:18.929
DON'T MEAN TO BE CAVALIER AT ALL

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.464
BUT THIS BILL.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.398
IN AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IN

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.100
ANY WAY TO DIMINISH THE STILL

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:25.135
VERY BENEFICIAL ASPECTS OF THIS

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:26.970
BILL BUT THIS BILL IS A SHADOW

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:28.538
OF ITS FORMER SELF.

00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:32.175
I WOULD BE -- VERY PLEASED TO BE

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:33.443
PRESENTING TO YOU THE BILL I

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.845
ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED AND I

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.780
WOULD STAND STILL BY THE BILL I

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.148
ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:40.217
BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.086
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS SUCH THAT

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:45.088
WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.457
LEGITIMATELY RESPONSIVE TO

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:49.526
CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED SO FOR

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.394
EXAMPLE.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.297
THE LIMITATIONS ON PARKING WHICH

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.231
WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:56.433
OBJECTION NOT ALL TO THE BILL IS

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.101
SOME IS THE FEAR.

00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.970
ABOUT THE IMPACT ON AFFORDABLE

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:01.138
HOUSING.

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:03.140
AND BURDEN IN NOTE THAT WE'VE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:06.076
HEARD PRIMARILY -- THAT

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.778
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:09.179
AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.480
AND POVERTY ARE IN SUPPORT OF

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.149
THE BILL BUT LET ME THE POINT

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.684
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.386
WHY A PAD PARKING IN THERE WHY I

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.255
HAD THE REMOVAL?

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:24.261
OF THE MINIMUM REQUIRED PARKING

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:26.797
UNITS IN THE ORIGINAL BILL.

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:29.566
IS BECAUSE PARKING ADDS COST.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:33.337
AND I DON'T WANT TO ADD COST WE

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:35.238
ARE IN A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.641
AND A HOUSING SUPPLY CRISIS WE

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:39.042
HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.410
CONSTRUCTION OF ANYWHERE IN THE

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.244
COUNTRY.

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:44.147
A PARKING UNIT DEPENDING ON THE

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.983
PROJECT CAN BE MINIMAL FIFTY

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.152
THOUSAND UPWARDS TO TWO HUNDRED

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:50.053
FIFTY THOUSAND JUST FOR A

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.455
PARKING SPOT.

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.689
SO I WAS TRYING TO BRING DOWN

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:54.291
COSTS BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.159
OBJECTION I COMPLETELY

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:57.160
ELIMINATED.

00:49:57.227 --> 00:50:00.364
DE ANY REFERENCE TO ANYTHING TO

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.998
DO WITH PARKING SO THAT'S GONE.

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:04.601
THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN THAT THE

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.103
BILL.

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.170
AFFECTED COASTAL HEIGHT LIMITS

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.973
SO I PUT IN THE BILL EXPLICITLY

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.442
THAT THE BILL IN NO WAY CAN

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.145
IMPACT INTERFERE WITH OR IMPACT

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:16.380
OR EFFECT COASTAL HEIGHT LIMIT

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.348
SO THAT IS EXPLICIT NOW IN THE

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:19.282
BILL.

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.651
THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN THAT THE

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:22.552
BILL.

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:25.288
WOULD -- THAT I ORIGINALLY FROZE

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.290
FEES BECAUSE AND WHAT I DIDN'T

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:28.125
SAY WHEN I OPEN AND I'M

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.260
APOLOGIES THIS BILL SUNSETS IN

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.195
FIVE YEARS THIS IS JUST FOR FIVE

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:32.996
YEARS.

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.332
AND I WAS TRYING TO FREEZE FEES

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:38.101
IN ORDER.

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:38.769
TO GET THE COST DOWN.

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.470
BUT THERE WAS.

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:42.606
VERY LEGITIMATE INSUBSTANTIAL

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.441
REACTION TO THAT.

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:46.877
SO WE ELIMINATED THAT THE ONLY

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:50.213
PORTION WE RETAINED IS THAT ONCE

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.815
CHAU AYE MY HOUSING APPLICANTS

COULD BE A SINGLE FOR IT COULD

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:56.453
BE I'M THE OWNER OF A LOT.

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:18.842
THEY ARE DETERMINING WHAT THE

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:19.743
FEES ARE.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.844
ONCE THEY HAVE DEEMED TO MY

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.046
APPLICATION COMPLETE THAT IS

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.714
WHEN THE FEES FREEZE AND IT ONLY

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:28.051
FREEZES AROUND MY APPLICATION.

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:31.121
NOT ON ANYTHING ELSE SO.

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:31.755
I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:32.789
ONE SO I DO APPRECIATE THE

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:34.357
QUESTION BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.359
NECESSARILY GO THROUGH ALL THE

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:37.394
OTHER -- ANOTHER.

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.229
ONE IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOR TEN

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:41.698
YEARS NOW IT SUNSETS IN.

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.732
FIVE ADDITIONALLY.

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:46.803
I HAD IN ORIGINAL BILL.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:47.804
THE NIGHT IS WHEN I SAY THIS I

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.139
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE BE LIKE HOW

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.007
COULD YOU EVER CONSIDER THIS I

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:53.376
HAD SUSPENDED BECAUSE THE WHOLE

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:56.246
POINT OF THE BILL WAS TO SUSPEND.

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:57.214
SOME OF PUT.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.915
A HOLD ON THE THINGS THAT LIMIT

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.217
HOUSING JUST FOR A LIMITED

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.319
PERIOD OF TIME SO WE KNOW THAT

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:04.020
SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:05.956
THERE'S BEEN VOTER INITIATIVES.

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:08.258
THAT BASICALLY HAVE PREVENTED A

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:10.126
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO UP SOONER

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:11.495
PREVENT OR MADE A LOCAL

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:13.430
GOVERNMENT HAVE ONLY SO MANY

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:13.964
HOUSING.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.733
SO WIDE SUSPENDED THOSE VOTER

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.436
APPROVALS OR THE ABILITY TO PUT

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.737
SOMETHING BEFORE THE VOTERS.

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.873
BUT OF COURSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.307
THAT WAS HER CAUSED A LOT OF

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.710
REACTION SO I GOT RID OF IT.

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:30.347
IT'S NO LONGER THERE -- AND I

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.915
ELIMINATED.

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:34.084
I MADE SURE THAT NOTHING IN THE

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.419
BILL IMPACTS SEA QUEST.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.889
SO THOSE ARE AMONG THE

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:40.123
AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW THERE ARE

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.958
COUNTLESS OTHERS BUT I HOPE IF

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:44.761
THERE'S ANY OTHER ASPECT THAT

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.363
WAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:47.898
I WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK THROUGH

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:50.600

OF THOSE CITIES IN PARTICULAR IS

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.889
THEIR TRACKS WERE BILLED THEM

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.424
ILLEGALLY I'M PERMITTED.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.625
WHEN THEY'RE HANDED THAT THESE

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.594
FEES IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.765
NEARLY? 330-010-00300 THOUSAND

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:23.866
AND PERMITTED UNITS IN THE

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:26.602
GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALONE.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:27.836
EIGHTY USER BUILT ON LOTS THAT

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:32.307
PAID DEVELOPMENT FEES HOMEOWNERS

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:33.609

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.244
THEM AGAIN LET ALONE PAY THE

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.480
AMOUNT CHARGED FOR THE PRIMARY

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:39.448
UNIT.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:40.115
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:40.883
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:43.685
HOMEOWNER CAN EXPAND THEIR HOUSE

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:46.054
FOR A BED FOR BEDROOM KITCHEN A

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.223
BATHROOM AND THEY WOULD PAY ZERO

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.091
IMPACT FEES.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.592
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I THINK I

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:51.860
MENTIONED THIS LAST YEAR MY WIFE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.296
AND I BUILT A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:55.097
SQUARE FOOT.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.266
ADDITION ONTO OUR HOUSE PUT

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:57.800
ANOTHER.

01:13:57.866 --> 01:14:00.602
STOVE IN A BRAND NEW BATHROOM

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:03.071
AND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FEET IT

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.973
WAS A ONE DAY PERMIT.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.341
OF ONE DAY OVER THE COUNTER --

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.510
PERMIT AND WE DIDN'T PAY ANY

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.478
IMPACT FEES.

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.313
SO SB THIRTEEN ALSO ADDRESSES

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.015
THE OWNER OCCUPANCY ORDINANCES

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.917
WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE OWNER TO

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:17.052
LIVE ON EITHER THE EIGHTY YOU OR

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.453
THE PRIMARY UNIT AND WE'RE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.855
NEARING THE BLOOM LANGUAGE THAT

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.256
WAS ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.357
EARLIER.

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.059
THERE IS THERE'S AN UNFOUNDED

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:24.927
FEAR.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.295
THAT INVESTORS WILL BE BUYING

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.397
HOMES JUST TO BUILD THEIR EIGHTY

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:29.531
USED TO RENT THEM OUT.

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:32.401
IN REALITY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.535
THAT THIS FEAR.

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.937
IS MISS PLACE AND THAT THE

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.572
MAJORITY OF EIGHTY USE ARE BUILT

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.273
BY HOMEOWNERS TO HOUSE FAMILY

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.241
AND FRIENDS.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.909
THE CITY OF PORTLAND DID A STUDY

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.645
THAT FOUND THAT OUT OF ONE

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:44.279
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY YOU

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:46.281
SURVEY ONLY 10% WERE BUILT BY

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:47.382
INVESTORS.

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:50.185
OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIRES --

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.553
REQUIREMENTS LIMIT THE

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.488
MARKETABILITY OF EIGHTY USE AND

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.723
PREVENTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.923
THEM.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:57.025
THERE HAVE BEEN BANKS REFUSING

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:59.261
TO GIVE A LOAN OUT TO HOMEOWNERS

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.429
BECAUSE OF THIS REQUIREMENT.

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:02.297
THERE IS NO OTHER TYPE OF

OCCUPANCY AND SEATTLE JUST

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.073
RECENTLY PASSED AN ORDINANCE

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.875
PREVENTING AT CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.176
FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF WILL

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.579
HOW THAT LOOKS.

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.680
OUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:19.648
REMAINING BARRIERS THAT

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.417

HOUSING AND I USED TO DO THIS

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.989
MORE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.759
RECENTLY LAST FEW YEARS --

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.928
CALIFORNIA AND CITY OF LOS

ESTIMATE SO WE HAVE ABOUT? FIFTY

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:29.818
THOUSAND IN THE CITY OF LA AND

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:32.955
ROUGHLY. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.324
THE COUNTY OF LA -- SINCE THE

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.326
VARIOUS.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:40.996
SB TEN SIXTY NINE IN AB TWENTY

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:41.630
NINE TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE LOS

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.565
HERE THE CITY OF LA HAS HAD

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.833
SUCCESS.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.502
IN A LOVING COMMITTED A. B. USE.

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.671
AND WE HAVE SEEN.

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.273
ALMOST TEN THOUSAND TO PERMIT

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.607
APPLICATIONS FOR EXCESS THREE

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:55.644
DWELLING UNITS IN THE CITY OF LA.

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.746
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:00.916
EIGHTEEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:01.516
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE CITY

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.451
OF LA SUCCESS.

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.886
HAS LARGELY BEEN BASED ON THE

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.889
LACK OF THE OWNER OCCUPANCY.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.125
REQUIREMENT IN THE CITY -- THE

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.793
CITY OF LA ALSO HAS.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.129
RELATIVELY LITTLE.

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.832
PERMIT FEES NOT PERMIT FEES BUT

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:19.201
DEVELOPMENT FEES RELATED TO

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.102
EIGHTY YOU SAID THOSE TO HAVE

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.036
BEEN.

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:24.272
A KEY IN THIS MOVE TO WOODS MORE

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.674
FORMAL LADY USE.

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:26.675
N..

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:29.678
I THINK IT WOULD BE.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.613
HELPFUL TO HAVE SIMILAR

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.682
REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE OTHER

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.951
CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:37.619
AND CERTAINLY THE STATE WE WILL

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.987
ARE LIKELY TO SEE.

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:41.823
MANY MORE PERMITTED A TO USE IF

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.291
THE FEES WERE LESS IF OWNER

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.860
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS WILL

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.762
LOWER.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:47.829
AND IT IS.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.664
MY ESTIMATES ARE IF IF WE DO

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.067
HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND ON COMMITTED

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.535
UNITS.

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.070
THAT IS ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.873
BILLION DOLLARS OF REAL ESTATE

01:17:57.939 --> 01:18:01.343
VALUES THAT COULD BRING IN --

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.677
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR SO IN

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.180
REAL ESTATE TAXES EVERY YEAR AT

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.049
THE CITY COUNTY LEVEL THAT WOULD

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:08.550
BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.786
SO THERE MIGHT BE WAYS OF MAKING

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.521
UP FOR LOST REVENUE ON THE

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.523
DEVELOPMENT FEES SIDE THROUGH

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.324
PROPERTY TAXES.

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:17.092
BUT WE WOULD HAVE WE BEEN BILL

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.227
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGULATE

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:21.930
SOME OF THESE UNITS AND STOP THE

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:23.698
ONES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY.

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:24.566
DANGEROUS.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:27.202
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:27.502

PRESIDENT OF PRE FAB EIGHTY YOU --

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.844
I'E BEEN BUILDING A USE FOR

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:38.680
ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS NOW -- SO

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.882
I'VE I'VE SEEN THE CHANGE -- IN

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:43.151
THE EIGHTY YOU INDUSTRY -- SINCE --

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.987
PURELY LEGISLATION IS TO AND AND

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.389
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW -- I

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.623
BUILT OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY OF

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.358
THEM SCATTERED ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.294
JURISDICTIONS -- SO I'VE SEEN A

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.962
LOT OF DIFFERENT CITIES AND AND

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.832
AND HOW THEY REACT TO EIGHTY USE --

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.500
WE KEEP ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.036
ACTED BUILDS IN ABOUT THIRTY TO

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:01.937
FIFTY IN THE DESIGN AND APPROVAL

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.605
PROCESS SO WE WERE VERY AWARE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.041
ABOUT WHAT'S ACTIVELY GOING ON

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:07.742
IN THE MARKET SO I WANT TO SHARE

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:09.377
WITH YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.947
THE MARKET ITSELF AND THEN AND

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.849
THEN HELP -- REALLY FOCUS ON

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.151
THESE TO THESE TWO KEY ISSUES OF

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.519
HONOR OCCUPANCY AND IMPACT FEES.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.154
SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE DONE A STUDY

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.389
OF OF OF THE OF THE MARKET AND

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.858
THERE'S ABOUT NINE MILLION HOMES

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.694
IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.895
THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR AN EIGHTY

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.730
YOU -- WITH STUDIES COMING OUT

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.332
OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL --

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.366
YOU'RE DOING RESEARCH ON

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.601
HOMEOWNER INTEREST -- THE

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.336
INTEREST LEVELS ABOUT 25% SO

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:35.070
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IN

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:38.840
CALIFORNIA THERE'S ROUGHLY ABOUT

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.375
TWO POINT TWO FIVE MILLION --

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.511
HOMES THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.111
IN DOING EIGHTY OF SO.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:43.745
NEED TO SAY THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:44.513
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.047
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH EIGHTY

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.415
YEARS AND I THINK IT'S MUCH

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:50.485
GREATER THAN MOST PEOPLE -- EVEN

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:51.853
EVEN THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.322
AS WE SPEAK LA IS RECORDED OVER

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:55.790
TEN THOUSAND A YOU APPLICATIONS

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:56.525
SINCE.

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.994
SINCE THE EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.463
BILL FROM MY KOWSKI -- AND WE'RE

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.497
CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DEAL WITH

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.366
SAN JOSE RIGHT NOW TO PRODUCE

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:07.702
FIVE THOUSAND UNITS FOR THEM ---AND FOCUSING ON THEM BEING

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.604
AFFORDABLE AND AN EXPEDITED --

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:10.472
AND WE'RE WORKING ON SIMILAR

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:11.840
EFFORTS WITH SAN MATTEO NAPA

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.842
SONOMA COUNTY AS WELL AS OAKLAND

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:15.076
SO THE INTEREST LEVEL IS

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:15.944
DEFINITELY THERE THERE'S NO

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.379
QUESTION ABOUT IT -- EVERYBODY

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.014
SEES THIS IS A VIABLE WAY TO

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.749
ADDRESS FOR WILL HOUSING BUT

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.850
WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.451
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT EIGHTY USE

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.854
AND WE AND WE DO EIGHTY USE AND

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.556
WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE FINANCING IN

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:30.358
HOUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:32.761
CAN GENERATE HOMES ACTUALLY --

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:35.497
CAN BE RENTED OUT AT 15250% OF

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.100
THE LOCAL A MY LEVELS -- AND I

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:39.734
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.236
KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.938
ABOUT A PRODUCT HERE.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.606
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE SUBSIDIES.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.641
SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RED TAPE

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.442
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.377
INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T REQUIRE

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.079
US ALLOCATING LAND -- IT'S A

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.881
IT'S A PRETTY SEAMLESS PRODUCT

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.816
IN TERMS OF OF WHAT CAN BE DONE

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.985
HERE AND AND AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.454
ACTUALLY WRAPPING UP A PROJECT--

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.523
IN DAVIS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.192
BE OF INTEREST TO YOU -- THE THE

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.227
EIGHTY YOU IS IS ACTUALLY

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.294
COSTING THEM EIGHT HUNDRED

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.829
THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH --

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:08.563
FINANCED.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.131
AND SO MARGUERITE UNITS ARE

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.233
GOING FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.234
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.401
THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTEEN HUNDRED

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:14.703
DOLLAR THIRTEEN SEVENTY SAVINGS

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:16.504
AND THAT PUTS THEM AT RIGHT

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.573
ABOUT 50% THE AND MY LEVEL TO

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.774
PUT A FAMILY MEMBER IN THAT UNIT

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:22.143
SO -- AND AGAIN ALL WITHOUT

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.713
SUBSIDIES SO HE HE THESE THIS

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.314
EFFORT HERE IS IS HUGELY

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.882
IMPORTANT IN A AND I I WANT TO I

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.351
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BUT WHEN

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.218
WE LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:34.222
BARRIERS -- OWNER OCCUPANCY IS

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.492
IS DEFINITELY -- IS A CONCERN AS

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.360
AS AS THE CENTER MENTIONED.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:39.427
IN EIGHTY USE ARE THE ONLY THING

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:40.328
THAT SEEMS TO BE SITTING ON

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.364
SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTIES THAT

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.698
ARE GETTING IN ON A ROCK HITS

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:44.766
THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:46.034
AND IT'S STRANGE THAT EVEN SHOWS

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.169
UP TIED TO EIGHTY USE GOING INTO

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.838
MULTI FAMILY WHERE WE THAT SAME

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:50.605
MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY WE CAN

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.107
BUILD A DUPLEX AND THERE'S NO ON

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:53.275
OUR OCCUPANCY ON IT.

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:54.709
SO IT IT IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:55.710
STRANGE TO DO THIS AND

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.046
HOMEOWNERS ARE VERY RECEPTIVE TO

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.649
THAT -- BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:01.916
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.852
THAT AS A BUILDER OF EIGHTY USE

01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:06.921
AND AND REALLY THE NUMBER ONE

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.356
BUILDER VIDEOS IN THE STATE. 80%

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:08.923
OF OUR BUSINESS IS DONE FOR

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.459
FAMILIES SO I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:13.395
THERE'S A FEAR THAT -- BUT THIS

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.329
COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.665
INVESTORS COME IN AND AND RUIN

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:17.399
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:20.535
BUT BUT WITHOUT WITHOUT ANYBODY

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.903
YOU KNOW REALLY.

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.806
IF FOCUSING ON RESTRICTING THAT.

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.374
WE'RE WE'RE STILL DOING 80% IN

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.043
AREAS LIKE LIKE OAKLAND THAT

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.277
DOESN'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.345
REQUIREMENTS.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.646
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:32.647
KNOW THAT THAT THAT THERE'S A

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.616
FEAR BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BASED

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.251
IN FACT IT'S BASED IN YOU KNOW A

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.119
POTENTIAL OUR CONCERN OF WHAT

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:39.020
COULD HAPPEN.

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:40.689
WE DO KNOW AS AS CENTER

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.190
MENTIONED FROM PORTLAND THAT --

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.091
THAT WENT OUT ON OUR COMMITTEE

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.460
WAS REMOVED SEVERAL YEARS BACK

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:46.394
IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.662
STILL SEEING THAT SPECULAR BILL

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:51.232
SPECULATIVE BILLS ARE ONLY. 10%

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.335
OF THE MARKET -- WE ALSO KNOW

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:54.169
THAT.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:55.603
WHEN WE LOOK TO MARKETS THAT ARE

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.138
MORE DEVELOPED AND TRY TO

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:57.806
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:58.873
THEM?

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.275
THERE ARE FOUR MARKETS THAT ARE

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.744
THE BIGGEST EIGHTY MARKETS IN IN

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.279
NORTH AMERICAN THAT'S PORTLAND.

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.714
LOS ANGELES VANCOUVER IN AUSTIN

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.215
AND ALL OF THEM HAVE ONE THING

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.149
IN COMMON.

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.884
THEY DON'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:10.985
RESTRICTIONS.

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:14.189
SO IT'S IF WE'RE GOING TO TAP

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.390
INTO THE POTENTIAL OF EIGHTY USE.

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:17.325
IT'S IT'S INCUMBENT THAT WE FIND

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:19.728
A WAY TO REMOVE THAT OUR

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:20.929
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS.

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:21.730
IS THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.164
THAT HOMEOWNERS JUST DON'T SEEM

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.366
TO UNDERSTAND.

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:24.899
AND I THINK IT'S A VERY

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:26.067
DIFFICULT THING WHEN WE GET INTO

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.702
IMPACT FEES THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.604
OF THIS PUZZLE THAT I I THINK IS

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.172
A IS A BIG DEAL BREAKER -- WE

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.074
JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED A

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:34.109
PROJECT IN DUBLIN.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.010
THE TOTAL FEES WERE THIRTY

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:36.811
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE HER

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.580
SQUARE FOOT UNIT THE EIGHTY YOU

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.614
COST NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:40.081
DOLLARS.

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.583
SO THOSE FEES REPRESENT ABOUT

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.952
31% OF THE BUILDING COST WHEN WE

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.587
DIVVY UP THE FEES THE ACTUAL

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.188
BUILDING PERMIT PORTION OF IT IS

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.423
ONLY THIRTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.125
SO -- REALLY SAYING IS THAT THAT

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.460
YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY SIX

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:53.128
THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPACT

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.096
FEES TIED TO THIS THREE HUNDRED

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:55.930
SQUARE FOOT EIGHTY YOU.

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:58.333
AND I I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.701
THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:00.769
EVEN AT THE CITY LEVEL THERE'S A

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:01.903
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:02.937
PROPORTIONATE.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.773
SCALE AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:05.840
DEAL WITH THAT.

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:06.274
AND WHEN THERE'S A

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:07.342
MISUNDERSTANDING THERE'S A

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:08.910
TENDENCY TO LEAVE THINGS THE WAY

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.178
THEY ARE AND MAKE THE HOMEOWNER

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.179
THAT THE THE ONE WHO BURDENS

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.047
THAT RATHER THAN ADDRESS IT AND

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:14.349
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT REALLY

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:15.550
DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:17.085
AT THIS LEVEL ONE OF THE THINGS

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.219
THAT I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE WHEN

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.521
WE LOOK AT THIS IS WHEN WE BRING

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.922
TWO SCENARIOS AND COMPARE THEM

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:21.990
TO EACH OTHER.

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.591
WE LOOK AT IN ADDITION AND WE

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:24.559
LOOK AT AN EIGHTY YOU OF THE

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.227
SAME PROPERTY THE SAME SIZE

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.530
HOUSE. ONE PERSON DOESN'T

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.631
ADDITION THE OTHER PERSON DOES

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:30.365
THE DATE THE EIGHTY YOU THE

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:33.401
ADDITION ISN'T ASSESSED ANY OF

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.136
THOSE IMPACT FEES.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.237
BUT YET THE EIGHTY YOU IS ONE

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:37.305
SOLUTION THE ADDITION JUST

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.174
CREATES A A MCMANSION PROBLEM

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:39.841
FOR US.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:40.875
THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.076
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT YET THE

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.511
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTION IS

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.946
GETTING HIT WITH THE IMPACT FEES.

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:45.980
SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.048
THIS AND THINK ABOUT THIS AND

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.483
UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE IT ISN'T

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.251
AS IF WE'RE TAKING MONEY AWAY

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:51.519
FROM CITIES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:52.821
REMOVING THIS WE'RE TALKING

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.088
ABOUT ACTUALLY GETTING THEM TO

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.256
UNDERSTAND IT IN THE SAME WAY

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.391
THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.093
ADDITION WHICH ISN'T HELPING THE

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.695
CITY OUT AT ALL CAN YOU WRAP IT

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.296
UP.

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:02.363
YES THANK YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.032
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE OTHERS

AS AS STORM WATER.

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.268
RUNS INTO OUR SYSTEM.

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:01.902
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:02.303
STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:03.904
HAVE COME UP WITH THE REGULATORY

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.172
SCHEME.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:07.207
THAT IMPOSES LIABILITY FOR THE

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:09.510
STORM WATER DISCHARGES ON CITIES

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:12.513
AND COUNTIES AND BUSINESSES.

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:13.614
IT'S A BIG ISSUE COSTS A LOT OF

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.682
MONEY.

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:16.050
THE STORM WATER RUNS OFF AND

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:17.084
IT'S IT HAS ALL KINDS OF JUNK IT

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.385
IT INCLUDES THE OCEAN --

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:19.520
POLLUTES OUR WATERWAYS IN A

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:21.689
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND IT'S

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:22.089
NOT GOOD.

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:23.157
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:25.192
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:26.226
TO THE STATE SYSTEM STATE WATER

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.761
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAVE

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:30.431
BASICALLY COME UP WITH A METHOD.

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:31.765
TO FIND GOVERNMENTS AND AND IN

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.233
THE LA COUNTY WHERE I COME FROM

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.702
WE PASSED A BIG MEASURE THAT

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.203
REQUIRES A CLEAN UP BEFORE THE

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.538
DISCHARGE.

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.906
I WANTED TO CAPTURE THAT WATER

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:40.674
AND REUSE IT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.142
CHAPTER IN ANOTHER DAY.

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.711
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT ARE

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:45.512
WE TRYING TO DO HERE SO HOW DO

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:46.347
WE ENFORCE THAT HERE'S THE

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:47.247
PROBLEM.

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.982
THAT SO MANY COMPANIES WHO ARE

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:51.985
REQUIRED TO GET THESE PERMITS

01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:53.420
FOR DISH CHARGE DON'T DO IT.

01:39:53.487 --> 01:39:54.455
SO HOW DOYOU COME UP WITH A

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:57.024
CREATIVE WAY THAT REQUIRES THEM

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:58.258
TO DO SO AND IT'S PARTICULARLY

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.627
EGREGIOUS BECAUSE IF A BUNCH OF

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:01.995
COMPANIES ARE POLLUTING.

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:04.064
E. THEY THEY GO OUT THEY POLLUTE

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.165
BUT THE BURDEN IF IT FALLS IN

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:06.867
ALL THE COMPLIANCE COMPANIES SO

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.202
HOW DO YOU CREATE EQUITY AND

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:09.536
FAIRNESS FOR BUSINESSES HOW DO

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:11.038
YOU REDUCE LIABILITIES FOR

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:12.106
CITIES AND COUNTIES.

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:13.240
AND WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID WHEN

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:14.675
YOU GO OUT THE CITY OR COUNTY

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:15.809
THAT HAS.

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.177
THAT HAS A BUSINESS PERMIT IF IT

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:21.682
DOES NOT REQUIRE ACCEPTING THE

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.150
AMENDMENTS WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE.

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:24.017
WE JUST BASICALLY GO AND WE SAY

01:40:24.084 --> 01:40:25.085

PEOPLE HAVE A PERMIT.

01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:30.157
IT WHEN THEY'RE GETTING A

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.992
BUSINESS LICENSE IT'S A PRETTY

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:33.927
SIMPLE THING A GOOD THE BENEFIT

BUT IT'S A PRETTY IN BALANCING

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:41.168
THE COST TO THE CITY BY ALL THIS

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.903

THERE -- IT TOOK THE LA RIVER ID

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.630
LET'S SAY THE LA RIVERS IN

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:51.331
IMPAIRED OR IS TO TOXIC TO BE

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:52.165
ABLE TO SWIM IN WITH THE

REGIONAL BOARD DOES THERE IS

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:54.334
THEY LOOK AT HOW MUCH.

01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:59.306
HOW MUCH METALS CAN BE

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:01.241
DISCHARGED INTO THAT RIVER?

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:02.409
OUR WITHOUT MAKING IT TALKS.

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:03.644
AND THE TAKE THAT NUMBER IN THE

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.311
DIVIDED AMONG ALL THE PROPERTIES

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:05.579
BUT IF 80% OF THE FOLKS THE

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:06.380
DESTRUCTION METALS INTO THE

01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:07.848
RIVER ARE NOT A PERMITS HE THEN

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:08.482
THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:10.083

ACTUALLY REACH THAT TARGET

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.630

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:24.197
THE PERMIT.

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:25.132

MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION THE

ISSUES IN A PERFECT WORLD -- WE

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:17.610
WOULD BE HAVING A CONVERSATION

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:19.312

VEHICLES FORWARD IN A IN A WAY

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:24.016
THAT -- COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER

02:00:24.083 --> 02:00:25.685
UNFORTUNATELY MINDS ON A TWO

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:28.187
YEAR TRACK NOW SO THINGS ARE A

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:30.756
LITTLE BIT DISCOMBOBULATED AND

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:39.332
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WERE --

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:41.000
AND CERTAINLY NOT OF BY ANY --

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:42.702
EFFORTS OF YOUR SENATOR BUT I

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.136
HOPE THAT WE DON'T ALL GET

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:46.806
BOGGED DOWN -- IN A WAY THAT

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:47.707
MAKES IT TO THE THAT STRETCHES

02:00:47.773 --> 02:00:49.976
OUT PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN WHICH

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:52.478
A IMPLEMENTATION REALLY HAPPENS

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.747
AND AND GEARS UP AND AND AND AND

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:56.782

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:17.036
WINGS WAY TOO LONG -- I THINK

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:18.604
THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH ME

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.639
WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THAT

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:21.207
FRANKLY THERE HAS BEEN NO

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:22.975
PROPOSAL THAT SAYS THIS IS A

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:25.711
BETTER WAY TO DO IT -- NUMBER

02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:27.747
ONE NUMBER TWO IS -- THIS IS NOT

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:29.081
THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE WORKED

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:30.182
ON THIS I WORKED ON THIS WHEN I

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:31.417

MORE THIRTY TO THE WATER BOARD

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:41.727

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:46.232
OF THE THINKS THE WATER BOARD

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:47.900
DOES I GET I DON'T AGREE WITH

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:50.369
BUT THERE IN THE IN THE PRIMARY

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:52.271
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SAY HERE

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:53.572

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:57.009
RECEIVED FROM THEM IN REGARDS TO

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:58.544
WHY WHY THEIR WATER IS NOT

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:01.280
POTABLE AND AND SO THEY HAVE

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:03.949
THIS ABILITY TO GO IN AND AND

02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:05.418
AND IDENTIFY THOSE AND SO WE'RE

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:06.585

SOME BIG STEPS AND INCLUDE A

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:42.500
HISTORIC ONE TIME.

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.668
INVESTMENTS TO HELP SHELTER

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:48.172
THOSE ON OUR CITY STREETS AND

02:30:48.239 --> 02:30:49.807
PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS. TO

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:50.441
GET A LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS BUT IT

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:55.012
FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE

02:30:55.079 --> 02:30:56.313
OF OUR HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:57.782

WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING AND

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:29.213
THE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.115
AND CITIES LIKE SO LOS ANGELES

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:32.516
FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE DESPITE THE

02:31:32.583 --> 02:31:34.118
BEST INTENTIONS THAT PASSED THE

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:36.153

AND MARKET RATE HOUSING IS PART

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:53.938

WITHOUT DELIBERATE INVESTMENTS.

02:31:56.540 --> 02:31:58.375
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT

02:31:58.442 --> 02:31:59.944
CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISING COST

02:32:00.010 --> 02:32:01.011
OF RENTS.

02:32:01.078 --> 02:32:02.780

TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ON AND

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:02.993
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO OPPOSE THE

02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:06.296
BILL AND IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS

02:45:06.363 --> 02:45:08.298
SITUATION -- THAT WERE INVOLVED

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:09.866
AND WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T --

02:45:09.933 --> 02:45:11.234
OPPOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE

02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:12.602
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:14.771
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO HELP --

02:45:14.838 --> 02:45:15.872
FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:17.440
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE SEE THE

02:45:17.507 --> 02:45:18.842
IMPACT OF THAT DIRECTLY IN THE

02:45:18.908 --> 02:45:20.877
CLASSROOM AS OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS

02:45:20.944 --> 02:45:23.013
ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:45:23.079 --> 02:45:24.681
CAN GIVE STUDENTS AS MUCH OF A

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:26.149
STABLE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

02:45:26.216 --> 02:45:27.083
CLASSROOM.

02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.918
WHEN WE HAVE THEM DURING THE DAY --

02:45:28.985 --> 02:45:30.220
THE SOLE DILEMMA THAT WE HAVE

02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:31.821
WITH THIS MEASURE IS THE USE OF

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:33.890
THE RAF FUNDS THAT HAS AN IMPACT

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:35.792
ON PROPERTY TAXES THAT WOULD GO

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:36.526
TO SCHOOLS.

02:45:36.593 --> 02:45:37.827
NOW FORTUNATELY CENTER BILL HAS

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:39.829
BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN TRYING

02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:42.232
TO AMELIORATE ANY KIND OF ISSUES

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:44.401
OF THAT HE CAN IN REGARD TO

02:45:44.467 --> 02:45:46.202
TRYING TO PROTECT SCHOOLS SO

02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:47.704
WHEN WE ARE IN GOOD ECONOMIC

02:45:47.771 --> 02:45:49.639
TIMES LIKE THIS YEAR TO NOT A

02:45:49.706 --> 02:45:51.007
PROBLEM THE BILL DOESN'T HURT AS

02:45:51.074 --> 02:45:51.508
IT DOESN'T.

02:45:51.574 --> 02:45:52.876
IMPACT US IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND

02:45:52.942 --> 02:45:55.045
WE DO APPRECIATE THAT MULTITUDE

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:56.780
OF A TENSE THAT THE CENTER HAS.

02:45:56.846 --> 02:45:59.082
TRIED TO ACHIEVE TO ADDRESS --

02:45:59.149 --> 02:46:00.483
ISSUES THAT COULD HARM SCHOOLS

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:02.519
OUR PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS IF

02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:04.020
WE GET INTO ANOTHER FISCAL

02:46:04.087 --> 02:46:05.789
DECLINE WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY

02:46:05.855 --> 02:46:08.425
HAPPEN WE LEARN VERY CLEARLY

02:46:08.491 --> 02:46:09.693
DURING THIS PAST RECESSION WHEN

02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:11.194
PROP NINETY EIGHT WAS SUSPENDED

02:46:11.261 --> 02:46:12.262
TWICE.

02:46:12.329 --> 02:46:13.496
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SUBJECT TO

02:46:13.563 --> 02:46:15.665
SIGNIFICANT HARM THE ANALYSIS OF

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:17.467
THE MEASURE ACTUALLY NOTES THAT

02:46:17.534 --> 02:46:19.703
GENERALLY THE THE GENERAL FUND

02:46:19.769 --> 02:46:21.771
WILL BACK FILL OUR SCHOOLS AND

02:46:21.838 --> 02:46:23.573
THIS SIGNIFICANT WORD TO KIAN ON

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.875
IS GENERALLY BECAUSE TWICE IN

02:46:25.942 --> 02:46:27.310
THE PAST DECADE.

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:28.578
THE STATE DID NOT BACK FOR ALL

02:46:28.645 --> 02:46:30.814
OUR SCHOOLS THAT IS THE SOLE

02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:32.415
REASON WHY WERE OPPOSING THIS

02:46:32.482 --> 02:46:34.718
MEASURE IF WE DO GO INTO AN

02:46:34.784 --> 02:46:35.752
ECONOMIC DECLINE.

02:46:35.819 --> 02:46:37.220
THIS OUR SCHOOLS THAT ARE

02:46:37.287 --> 02:46:39.089
RELIANT ON THOSE PROPERTY TAX

02:46:39.155 --> 02:46:41.257
REVENUES COULD BE IN A SITUATION

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:43.760
WHERE THE STATE COULD CHOOSE NOT

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:44.527
TO BACK FILL.

02:46:44.594 --> 02:46:46.429
I'M IN THE DILEMMA THAT WE WOULD

02:46:46.496 --> 02:46:47.397
HAVE IS IF WE'RE IN THAT

02:46:47.464 --> 02:46:49.666
ECONOMIC SITUATION THE SCHOOLS

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:51.167
THAT ARE RELYING ON THOSE FUNDS

02:46:51.234 --> 02:46:55.472
WOULD BE HURT EVEN MORE

02:46:55.538 --> 02:46:56.473
SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THEY WERE OR

02:46:56.539 --> 02:46:57.507
IN THE LAST ECONOMIC DECLINE.

02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:58.341
BECAUSE WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH IN

02:46:58.408 --> 02:46:59.476
IF THE STATE DOESN'T BACKFILL

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:01.444
SCHOOLS THE PROPERTY TAXES THAT

02:47:01.511 --> 02:47:02.712
THEY WOULD RECEIVE WOULD HAVE

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:04.647
ACTUALLY BEEN A MORE STABLE

02:47:04.714 --> 02:47:07.751
ECONOMIC SOURCE -- THEN THE PROP

02:47:07.817 --> 02:47:08.351
NINETY EIGHT FUNDS THAT THEY

02:47:08.418 --> 02:47:09.319
COULD HAVE RECEIVED AN

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:10.987
UNECONOMIC DECLINE FOR SO FOR

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:12.756
THOSE REASONS CTA'S

02:47:12.822 --> 02:47:14.724
UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION.

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:16.326
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES MADAM

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:29.506
MERE SOME OF MS BAKER'S COMMENTS

02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:33.343
THIS -- SIMPLY SIMPLY IN REGARDS

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:35.478
TO THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THIS

02:47:35.545 --> 02:47:36.446
BILL.

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:38.114
OF THE MONEY HERE THAT WE'RE

02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:39.482
TALKING ABOUT.

02:47:39.549 --> 02:47:40.717
YOU KNOW COULD RESULT IN WOULD

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:42.252
BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A THIRTY

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:44.788
BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BOND

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:46.589
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S HE AMOUNT

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:47.924
OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:48.825
ABOUT HERE THAT COULD BE BONDED

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:49.459
OUT.

02:47:49.526 --> 02:47:50.860
OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES BUT THE

02:47:50.927 --> 02:47:52.095
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GENERAL

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:53.563
OBLIGATION BOND AND WHAT'S BEING

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:55.365
PROPOSED IN SB.

02:47:55.432 --> 02:47:56.466
FIVE IS THAT G. O. BONDS REQUIRE

02:47:56.533 --> 02:47:57.600
A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE

02:47:57.667 --> 02:47:59.302

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:01.738

UNDER SB.

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:04.174
FIVE RIGHT NOW LISTEN WE HAVE A

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:05.208
DEBT SERVICE RATIO IN THE STATE

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:07.477
OF CALIFORNIA 6% THAT MEANS THE

02:48:07.544 --> 02:48:09.179
FIRST 6% OF REVENUE OUT OF STATE

02:48:09.245 --> 02:48:10.947
GENERAL FUND GOES TO NOTHING

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:13.149
MORE OR LESS THAN PAYING OFF.

02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:14.951
BOND AND TO MISS BAKER'S POINT

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:16.219
WE REALLY DO NEED TO BE

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.488
CONCERNED I THINK WHEN AND IT

02:48:18.555 --> 02:48:20.356
WILL BE WHEN AND NOT IF WE HAD

02:48:20.423 --> 02:48:22.192
AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WE

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:23.326
SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE

02:48:23.393 --> 02:48:24.627
FLEXIBILITY.

02:48:24.694 --> 02:48:26.696

TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS

HAS A SPECIFIC SECTION IN IT

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:41.551

THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

02:52:59.102 --> 02:53:00.436
CAN DO COULD PUSH.

02:53:00.503 --> 02:53:03.339
THAT WILL STOP THIS PROGRAM FROM

02:53:03.406 --> 02:53:04.674
CONTINUING.

02:53:04.741 --> 02:53:08.578
AND IT WILL -- IT IS IN ESSENCE --

02:53:08.644 --> 02:53:09.912
SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO THIS

02:53:09.979 --> 02:53:12.882
PROGRAM THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE

02:53:12.949 --> 02:53:13.783
PROBLEM.

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:17.220
WITH -- PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THE

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:20.690
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S CONCLUDED.

02:53:20.757 --> 02:53:23.259
ED SAYS -- IT IS IN THE SUMMARY

02:53:23.326 --> 02:53:24.961
I GOT THEY HAVE A THREE PAGE

02:53:25.027 --> 02:53:26.195
LETTER THEY RIP THEY WROTE.

02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:27.697
AND IT'S PUBLISHED A PUBLISHED

02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:28.264
LETTER.

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.133
IS IS UNDER SB FIVE THE STATE

02:53:30.199 --> 02:53:31.701
WOULD REQUIRED TO READ BENCH THE

02:53:31.768 --> 02:53:32.969
RAFT REDUCTIONS.

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.604
AUTHORIZED BY THE AFFORDABLE

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:36.038
HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:37.273
INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.775
THIS REQUIREMENT MEANS THE STATE

02:53:38.841 --> 02:53:40.610
EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE COVERING

02:53:40.676 --> 02:53:41.878
THE COST OF THE PROGRAM THROUGH

02:53:41.944 --> 02:53:43.546
GENERAL FUND SPENDING RATHER

02:53:43.613 --> 02:53:47.183
THAN REDUCTION IN SCHOOL FUNDING.

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:48.317
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S GOING TO BE

02:53:48.384 --> 02:53:50.186
COMPLETELY COVERED AND I THINK

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:52.889
IF YOU WANTED TO GET INTO DETAIL.

02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:55.691
OF FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT -- THE

02:53:55.758 --> 02:53:57.894
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAS HAS

02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:00.596
LOOKED AT SO -- WE WE'VE LOOKED

02:54:00.663 --> 02:54:02.064
AT THIS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE

02:54:02.131 --> 02:54:03.733
PUT A LOT OF GUARANTEES TO

02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:05.334
PROTECT SCHOOLS AND I THINK THEY

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:07.069
RECOGNIZE THAT WE TRIED TO DO

02:54:07.136 --> 02:54:07.837
THAT.

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:09.605
THEY'RE JUST OBJECTING TO THE

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:11.274
USE OF THE ROUGH I THINK.

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:13.009
THEY KNOW THAT THIS BILL AS

02:54:13.075 --> 02:54:14.677
OPPOSED TO MANY OTHER BILLS THAT

02:54:14.744 --> 02:54:16.078
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE.

02:54:16.145 --> 02:54:18.815
AND THROUGH THE SENATE --

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:22.151
RELATING TO PROPERTY TAX -- OF

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:23.452
SHIPS.

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:24.520
THAT HAD NO PROTECTION

02:54:24.587 --> 02:54:26.088
WHATSOEVER.

02:54:26.155 --> 02:54:27.256
THIS BILL IS THE ONLY BILL THIS

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:28.591
YEAR THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:30.126
PROPERTY TAX PROTECTION.

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:32.829
OF ANY KIND OF SHOW OF

02:54:32.895 --> 02:54:34.030
PROTECTING SCHOOLS SO.

02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:34.897
SO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AS FAR

02:54:34.964 --> 02:54:36.365
AS WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST

02:54:36.432 --> 02:54:37.767
AS FAR AS BACK FEELING NOT

02:54:37.834 --> 02:54:39.368
COMING TO FRUITION DURING SOME.

02:54:39.435 --> 02:54:41.904
OF TOUGH TIMES WITHIN THE BUDGET

02:54:41.971 --> 02:54:43.539
THIS BILL HAS BUILT IN

02:54:43.606 --> 02:54:44.740
PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ANY

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.609
MONEY COMING OUT OF THROUGH THIS

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.411
BILL FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT WILL.

02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:50.179
WILL BE BACK FIELD AND IF THERE

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:51.848
IS SOME HESITANCE TO THAT THE

02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:53.583
LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE WHERE

02:54:53.649 --> 02:54:54.750
WITH ALL TO STOP THAT.

02:54:54.817 --> 02:54:55.952
FROM CONTINUING FOR THAT'S

02:54:56.018 --> 02:54:58.154
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S BEEN GOING

02:54:58.221 --> 02:54:59.555
ON IN THE PAST.

02:54:59.622 --> 02:55:02.325
AND WE HAVE ALSO OF COURSE NOW.

02:55:02.391 --> 02:55:05.228
THE LAW REQUIRES IS TO HAVE A

02:55:05.294 --> 02:55:06.162
RAINY DAY FUND.

02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:07.897
WHICH PROVIDES A RESERVE IN CASE

02:55:07.964 --> 02:55:09.732
WE NEED TO USE THAT AND IF THE

02:55:09.799 --> 02:55:11.868
RAINY DAY FUND ISSUES THIS BILL

02:55:11.934 --> 02:55:13.336
FREEZES PROGRAM.

02:55:13.402 --> 02:55:15.438
AND PROHIBITS OF PROHIBITED TO

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:16.272
GO ON FOR EXAMPLE.

02:55:16.339 --> 02:55:17.640
SO WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:20.343
PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL THAT

02:55:20.409 --> 02:55:22.645
PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS OKAY THANK

02:55:22.712 --> 02:55:26.616

THE BILL'S FOCUS ALSO IS ON

02:57:09.285 --> 02:57:10.786

PROTECTIONS.

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:29.572

02:57:29.638 --> 02:57:33.476
LOT OF ARE INTO IT ENTITIES

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:35.177

ALREADY THE INTENT OF THE BILL.

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:12.815

CHANGE THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE.

03:03:28.797 --> 03:03:30.399

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:37.439
THEN THE CITY NEEDS TO ALLOW

THE MINISTERIAL PERMITS -- THE

03:10:21.209 --> 03:10:22.811
WAY THE LANGUAGES IN THE BILL IT

03:10:22.878 --> 03:10:23.945

BEHALF OF LIVABLE CALIFORNIA --

03:11:19.868 --> 03:11:21.169
I'M HERE TO OBJECT TO THIS BILL

03:11:21.236 --> 03:11:23.839
REALLY ON THREE BASIS THE FIRST

03:11:23.905 --> 03:11:24.673
ONE IS PROCESS.

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:26.274
THIS BILL PASSED THE SENATE AS A

03:11:26.341 --> 03:11:29.110
BILL ON BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGY

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:30.879
IS A LICENSING BILL.

03:11:30.946 --> 03:11:32.214
IT WAS GUIDED IN AMENDED BEFORE

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:33.915
THIS ASSEMBLY AND SHOWED UP AS A

03:11:33.982 --> 03:11:35.183
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY BILL BY

03:11:35.250 --> 03:11:36.651
SURPRISE.

03:11:36.718 --> 03:11:38.019
THAT IS A PROCESS THAT CANDIDLY

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:39.487
PARTICULARLY ON THE SUBJECT THE

03:11:39.554 --> 03:11:41.022
SENSITIVE THAT HAS DIVIDED OUR

03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:42.424
STATE.

03:11:42.490 --> 03:11:44.192
AND HONESTLY DIVIDED OUR PARTY

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:45.694
AS STRONGLY AS THIS ONE HAS.

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:47.229
REALLY SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED

03:11:47.295 --> 03:11:48.597
BY THIS BODY.

03:11:48.663 --> 03:11:49.898
IT IS NOT NECESSARY AT THIS

03:11:49.965 --> 03:11:52.634
POINT YOU JUST BACK PAST THREE

03:11:52.701 --> 03:11:53.468
THIRTY OUT.

03:11:53.535 --> 03:11:55.203
AND THERE IS NO REASON TO KEEP

03:11:55.270 --> 03:11:57.472
GOING WITH THESE KINDS OF COTTON

03:11:57.539 --> 03:11:58.773
AMEND PROCEDURES.

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:00.542
ON THERE REALLY MISPERCEIVED BY

03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:01.543
THE ELECTORATE.

03:12:01.610 --> 03:12:03.778
AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO NOT GO

03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:05.914
FORWARD ON A PROCESS BASIS ALONG

03:12:05.981 --> 03:12:07.983
ALONE THE SECOND REASON IS

03:12:08.049 --> 03:12:08.850
SUBSTANCE.

03:12:08.917 --> 03:12:09.684
ALTHOUGH THE BILL HAS BEEN

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:11.186
AMENDED AND I REALLY DO

03:12:11.253 --> 03:12:12.654
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:12:12.721 --> 03:12:13.288
WERE DONE IN THE HOUSING

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:14.089
COMMITTEE.

03:12:14.155 --> 03:12:16.124
OM I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THE

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:17.859
LAST WORD FROM CHAIRMAN CHIU

03:12:17.926 --> 03:12:19.561
WITH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WAS

03:12:19.628 --> 03:12:20.996
BE CAREFUL WE MAY USE THE SUMMER

03:12:21.062 --> 03:12:23.298
RECESS. TO BRING BACK SOME OF

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:24.599
THE THINGS THAT WE TOOK OUT.

03:12:24.666 --> 03:12:25.800
AND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY

03:12:25.867 --> 03:12:28.103
UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE

03:12:28.169 --> 03:12:29.104
THINGS THAT WAS TAKEN OUT WAS

03:12:29.170 --> 03:12:30.572
THE ONE THAT WOULD PERMIT

03:12:30.639 --> 03:12:31.473
MANSIONS.

03:12:31.539 --> 03:12:32.574
IT BASICALLY SAID THAT THE

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.342
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WOULD

03:12:34.409 --> 03:12:35.877
APPLY TO A SINGLE UNIT.

03:12:35.944 --> 03:12:38.380
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT

03:12:38.446 --> 03:12:41.049
PUSH FROM SACRAMENTO. TO IMPOSE

03:12:41.116 --> 03:12:42.651
THE KIND OF LEGISLATION OF ONE

03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:43.985
SIZE FITS ALL THAT WOULD PERMIT

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:46.121
MAKE MANSIONS THAT HAS NOTHING

03:12:46.187 --> 03:12:48.023
TO DO WITH HOMELESSNESS.

03:12:48.089 --> 03:12:49.524
NOTHING TO DO WITH AFFORDABILITY.

03:12:49.591 --> 03:12:50.926
AND IS WAY BEYOND WHAT WE OUGHT

03:12:50.992 --> 03:12:52.127
TO BE DOING AGAINST LOCAL

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.862
CONTROLS AND SO I WOULD URGE

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:55.997
THIS BODY TO NOT PERMIT.

03:12:56.064 --> 03:12:57.866
THIS BILL TO GO FORWARD WHEREIT

03:12:57.933 --> 03:12:59.834
COULD BE GUIDED IN AMENDED TO DO

03:12:59.901 --> 03:13:01.102
THAT AGAIN.

03:13:01.169 --> 03:13:02.771
A THIRD REASON IS NEAT.

03:13:02.837 --> 03:13:04.205
YOU DON'T NEED THIS BILL YOU

03:13:04.272 --> 03:13:06.875
JUST PASSED OUT SB.

03:13:06.942 --> 03:13:08.009
THREE THIRTY YOU JUST PASSED OUT

03:13:08.076 --> 03:13:10.078
SB.

03:13:10.145 --> 03:13:11.379
THIRTEEN IF ALL THIS BILL IS

03:13:11.446 --> 03:13:11.780
DOING.

03:13:11.846 --> 03:13:13.882
IS REALLY KEEPING CITIES AND

03:13:13.949 --> 03:13:15.050
COUNTIES THE HOUSING

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:17.218
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WE JUST HEARD

03:13:17.285 --> 03:13:19.187
SENATOR SKINNER SAID THAT'S WITH

03:13:19.254 --> 03:13:20.322
THREE THIRTY WAS DOING.

03:13:20.388 --> 03:13:22.724
IF WHAT THIS IS DOING IS MAKING

03:13:22.791 --> 03:13:24.459
EIGHTY USE MORE AFFORDABLE AND

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:25.627
MORE ACCESSIBLE WITH US AT A

03:13:25.694 --> 03:13:27.562
LOCAL LEVEL WE JUST HEARD

03:13:27.629 --> 03:13:29.331
SENATOR WE CAL SKI SAY.

03:13:29.397 --> 03:13:30.865
THAT'S WHAT SB THIRTEEN

03:13:30.932 --> 03:13:31.633
INSTANTLY.

03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:33.301
AND WE DO KNOW THAT -- ASSEMBLY

03:13:33.368 --> 03:13:35.103
MEMBER BLOOM IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:35.737
FRIEDMAN.

03:13:35.804 --> 03:13:37.205
HAVE BILLS THAT HAVE PASSED OUT

03:13:37.272 --> 03:13:38.773
OF COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE WE

03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.378
DON'T NEED THIS BILL FOR OVER OF

03:13:43.445 --> 03:13:44.112
FOR EIGHTY USED AT ALL.

03:13:44.179 --> 03:13:45.246
OKAY SO LET'S EXAMINE WHAT'S

03:13:45.313 --> 03:13:46.481
LEFT OF THIS BILL WHAT IS IT

03:13:46.548 --> 03:13:48.216
DOING.

03:13:48.283 --> 03:13:49.851
AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE PARANOID

03:13:49.918 --> 03:13:51.619
BUT WITH CUTS IN A MAN'S LAST

03:13:51.686 --> 03:13:52.687
YEAR AND GOTTEN A MAN'S THIS

03:13:52.754 --> 03:13:54.622
YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S

03:13:54.689 --> 03:13:56.057
ARGUABLY DOING.

03:13:56.124 --> 03:13:57.692
IS PROVIDING A VEHICLE FOR YET

03:13:57.759 --> 03:13:59.961
ANOTHER GUT AND AMEND IN AUGUST

03:14:00.028 --> 03:14:00.996
OR SEPTEMBER.

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:02.130
THE COULD AGAIN SURPRISED

03:14:02.197 --> 03:14:03.598
ELECTRIC.

03:14:03.665 --> 03:14:04.733
AND I SUBMIT TO THIS COMMITTEE

03:14:04.799 --> 03:14:06.401
THAT THAT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE

03:14:06.468 --> 03:14:07.969
THING TO PASS OUT INTO A

03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:09.204
PASSWORD.

03:14:09.270 --> 03:14:10.772
THE SECOND THING THAT IT IS

03:14:10.839 --> 03:14:12.040
DOING IS IT IS PROVIDING.

03:14:12.107 --> 03:14:13.842
ARGUMENT AND A LIMITATION ON

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:15.410
BEDROOMS LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:17.212
FOR A MINUTE VERY FEW CITIES AND

03:14:17.278 --> 03:14:18.013
COUNTIES.

03:14:18.079 --> 03:14:19.781
SAY THAT THEY REGULATE THE

03:14:19.848 --> 03:14:21.116
NUMBER OF BEDROOMS.

03:14:21.182 --> 03:14:23.685
CERTAINLY NO CITY OR COUNTY SAID

03:14:23.752 --> 03:14:25.520
YOU CAN'T HAVE.

03:14:25.587 --> 03:14:28.323
FROM FEWER THAN THREE BEDROOMS

03:14:28.390 --> 03:14:30.492
THIS ISN'T AN ANTI FAMILY BILL

03:14:30.558 --> 03:14:32.127
WHAT MOST CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:14:32.193 --> 03:14:33.795
SAVES YOU CAN'T REDUCE A BEDROOM

03:14:33.862 --> 03:14:36.564
TO A TEN BY TEN DORM ROOM.

03:14:36.631 --> 03:14:38.233
STACK IT WITH BUNK BEDS.

03:14:38.299 --> 03:14:39.834
AND THEN RENT OUT BETS AS A CO

03:14:39.901 --> 03:14:42.003
HOME SHARING ARRANGEMENT WHICH

03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:44.005
REALLY CREATES DENSITY WHAT YOU

03:14:44.072 --> 03:14:45.573
HAVE IS YOU HAVE A LOT OF

03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:47.308
INDUSTRY THAT'S COMING IN PLACE

03:14:47.375 --> 03:14:48.843
IS CALLED UPSTART.

03:14:48.910 --> 03:14:49.978
THAT CITIES ARE TRYING TO

DENSITY RESIDENTIAL

03:14:55.683 --> 03:14:56.718
NEIGHBORHOODS.

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:58.053

PARKING IN THE CITY SERVICES

03:14:59.721 --> 03:15:01.089
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.

03:15:01.156 --> 03:15:03.358
OUR CITIES ARE TRYING TO DO THE

03:15:03.425 --> 03:15:04.692
ACT.

03:15:04.759 --> 03:15:06.127
WHAT BEDROOMS NUMBER OF BEDROOMS

03:15:06.194 --> 03:15:07.395

03:15:07.462 --> 03:15:09.230

GOTTEN THE MEN WERE A POLICY

03:15:14.769 --> 03:15:16.071
COMMITTEE HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

03:15:16.137 --> 03:15:17.338
REALLY LOOK AT THIS AND EXAMINE

03:15:17.405 --> 03:15:18.706
WHAT IT DOES ON A STATEWIDE

03:15:18.773 --> 03:15:21.476
BASIS. TO JUST SAY NO FINALLY

03:15:21.543 --> 03:15:23.978
THE DEFINITION OF LOWER DENSITY

03:15:24.045 --> 03:15:25.580
IS INCREDIBLY FAKE.

03:15:25.647 --> 03:15:27.415
IT CREATES NOW WITHOUT THE

03:15:27.482 --> 03:15:29.050
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BECAUSE

03:15:29.117 --> 03:15:30.518
IT'S NOT AS BAD.

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:31.519
BUT IT CREATES A REALLY VAGUE

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:33.688
DEFINITION FOR A DEVELOPER TO

03:15:33.755 --> 03:15:35.657

HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS.

03:18:21.189 --> 03:18:23.591
THE PERCEPTION OF THIS BILL IS

03:18:23.658 --> 03:18:23.758
IT.

03:18:23.825 --> 03:18:24.325
WHAT?

03:18:24.392 --> 03:18:26.794

CLARIFY THAT FOR ON THE RECORD

03:18:39.574 --> 03:18:42.810
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

03:18:42.877 --> 03:18:45.346
SURE THAT A MICROPHONE BACK --

03:18:45.413 --> 03:18:45.947

PEOPLE -- WHO -- DECIDED NOT TO

READ THE BILL OR SOME PEOPLE WHO

03:18:58.626 --> 03:19:00.528

SPREAD MISINFORMATION TO THE LOT

03:19:02.497 --> 03:19:03.531
OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN SPREAD

03:19:03.598 --> 03:19:05.700
AROUND -- AROUND THIS BILL

03:19:05.767 --> 03:19:08.102
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A PRETTY -- A

03:19:08.169 --> 03:19:09.137
DISCREET BILL THAT THAT SOME

03:19:09.203 --> 03:19:11.072
VERY SPECIFIC.

03:19:11.139 --> 03:19:12.807
THINGS THIS DOES NOT AND

03:19:12.874 --> 03:19:15.276
DISCRETIONARY PERMITTING.

03:19:15.343 --> 03:19:18.012
THE H. A CURRENTLY EXISTS AND

03:19:18.079 --> 03:19:20.748
REQUIRES CITIES TO ABIDE BY

03:19:20.815 --> 03:19:21.783
THEIR OWN.

03:19:21.849 --> 03:19:23.851
LOCALLY ADOPTED RULES THAT EXIST

03:19:23.918 --> 03:19:25.720
RIGHT NOW SO TO TO THE EXTENT

03:19:25.787 --> 03:19:28.623
THAT THAT LIMITS DISCRETION.

03:19:28.690 --> 03:19:30.158
THAT DISCRETION HAS BEEN LIMITED

03:19:30.224 --> 03:19:32.593
SINCE -- NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO

03:19:32.660 --> 03:19:34.195
THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THAT -- YOU

03:19:34.262 --> 03:19:35.363
I'M FOR EXAMPLE WE HEARD ABOUT

03:19:35.430 --> 03:19:38.099
THE THE BAY DEFINITION OF LOWER

03:19:38.166 --> 03:19:38.766
DENSITY THAT'S IN A THAT'S THE

03:19:38.833 --> 03:19:40.868
DEFINITION IN THE EXISTING

03:19:40.935 --> 03:19:42.704
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO.

03:19:42.770 --> 03:19:44.539
IF PEOPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE

03:19:44.605 --> 03:19:45.973
EXISTING A TODAY PEOPLE ARE

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:47.108
ENTITLED TO THE COMPLAINTS BUT

03:19:47.175 --> 03:19:49.944
THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE -- WITH THIS

03:19:50.011 --> 03:19:51.646
BILL -- SO ALL WE'RE DOING IN

03:19:51.713 --> 03:19:52.547
THIS BILL IS MAKING

03:19:52.613 --> 03:19:54.382
CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT A FEW

03:19:54.449 --> 03:19:55.583
THINGS THAT.

03:19:55.650 --> 03:19:58.086
ARE INCLUDED IN THE HA WE'RE NOT

03:19:58.152 --> 03:20:04.792
CHANGING THE STANDARDS OF THE H.

03:20:04.859 --> 03:20:06.694
A..

03:20:06.761 --> 03:20:08.463
THE OTHER THING -- IF YOU COULD

03:20:08.529 --> 03:20:09.497
ANSWER THIS QUESTION SUMMER IN

03:20:09.564 --> 03:20:10.431
IN MY IN MY CITIES NONE OF US

03:20:10.498 --> 03:20:12.333
HAVE PERMITTING -- OR ANY

03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:13.601
SPECIFICATIONS AROUND NUMBER OF

03:20:13.668 --> 03:20:14.535
BEDROOMS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING IN

03:20:14.602 --> 03:20:16.804
OUR ZONING -- SO IT'S CONFUSING

03:20:16.871 --> 03:20:18.005
I THINK TO SOME PEOPLE IN MY

03:20:18.072 --> 03:20:19.574
DISTRICT AND THEY READ IT

03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:20.641
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT COULD

03:20:20.708 --> 03:20:23.644
YOU GO INTO WHY YOUR BILL TALK

03:20:23.711 --> 03:20:25.380
ABOUT THAT YES -- AND THERE ARE

03:20:25.446 --> 03:20:27.115
SOME CITIES THAT I SHOULD DO IN

03:20:27.181 --> 03:20:28.416
THEIR ZONING HAVE SAY A MINIMUM

03:20:28.483 --> 03:20:30.084
NUMBER OF BEDROOMS FOR EXAMPLE

03:20:30.151 --> 03:20:33.054
WANTING MORE FAMILY SIZE HOUSING --

03:20:33.121 --> 03:20:34.355
SO THERE THERE ARE SOME CITIES

03:20:34.422 --> 03:20:37.291
THAT DO THAT -- BUT WHAT THE IN

03:20:37.358 --> 03:20:39.794
THIS BILL IT WOULD YES IF YOU

03:20:39.861 --> 03:20:41.362
HAPPEN TO HAVE AS YOU'RE

03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:43.865
REQUIRED TO BYE BYE -- BUT WHAT

03:20:43.931 --> 03:20:45.233
THE BUILT WITH IT'S DESIGNED TO

03:20:45.299 --> 03:20:48.436
GET AT IS THAT SOMETIMES FOR

03:20:48.503 --> 03:20:49.270
EXAMPLE.

03:20:49.337 --> 03:20:50.638
A PERSON MIGHT BE KNOWN FOR FOR

03:20:50.705 --> 03:20:53.508
UNITS -- AND BASED ON THE HI AND

03:20:53.574 --> 03:20:55.810
THE MASS ALLOWED BY LOCAL ZONING

03:20:55.877 --> 03:20:57.044
WHICH IT SAYS NOT OVERRIDE --

03:20:57.111 --> 03:20:59.046
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD FOR

03:20:59.113 --> 03:21:06.087
UNITS OUTSIDE OF NINE HUNDRED

03:21:06.154 --> 03:21:07.288
SQUARE FEET EACH.

03:21:07.355 --> 03:21:08.423
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DISALLOWED

03:21:08.489 --> 03:21:10.324
MAYBE EACH OF THEM HAVING TWO

03:21:10.391 --> 03:21:12.126
BEDROOMS OR MAYBE THREE SO

03:21:12.193 --> 03:21:13.461
COMICAL ABOUT -- WHAT THIS BILL

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:14.562
WOULD DISALLOW THAT THE CITY

03:21:14.629 --> 03:21:15.229
CAME BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT

03:21:15.296 --> 03:21:16.397
WE KNOW IS GOING TO FOR FOR

03:21:16.464 --> 03:21:17.899
UNITS WE KNOW WE SAID AX HI WE

03:21:17.965 --> 03:21:19.000
KNOW WE SAID THIS IS A STEP BACK

03:21:19.066 --> 03:21:19.467
REQUIRED?

03:21:19.534 --> 03:21:20.101
AND WE KNOW THAT THAT MEANS YOU

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:22.303
CAN DO FOR UNITS AT NINE HUNDRED

03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.737
SQUARE FEET EACH.

03:21:22.804 --> 03:21:23.971
WE'RE GONNA REALLY ONLY ALLOW

03:21:24.038 --> 03:21:26.474
YOU FOR UNITS AT THREE HUNDRED

03:21:26.541 --> 03:21:27.909
SQUARE FEET EACH.

03:21:27.975 --> 03:21:29.510
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A FAMILY

03:21:29.577 --> 03:21:30.611
LIVING THERE WOULD PREFER TO

03:21:30.678 --> 03:21:31.979
HAVE A SINGLE PERSON LIVING

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:33.381
THERE SO THE CITY WOULD HAVE

03:21:33.448 --> 03:21:37.118
OVER ROAD AND VIOLATED ITS OWN

03:21:37.185 --> 03:21:38.553
RULES.

03:21:38.619 --> 03:21:39.554
AND SO UNDER THE BUILDING CODE

03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:42.824
WHEN YOU HAVE -- A HOUSING UNIT

03:21:42.890 --> 03:21:43.925

03:21:43.991 --> 03:21:45.092
SQUARE FEET.

03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:46.694
THE BUILDING CODE WILL DICTATE

03:21:46.761 --> 03:21:48.062
HOW MANY WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM

03:21:48.129 --> 03:21:50.665
NUMBER OF BEDROOMS THAT YOU CAN.

03:21:50.731 --> 03:21:52.166
FIT THEIR CONSISTENT WITH THE

03:21:52.233 --> 03:21:53.501
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND AND THE

03:21:53.568 --> 03:21:55.369
BUILDING CODE THERE MIGHT BE ONE

03:21:55.436 --> 03:21:57.505
BEDROOM OR MIGHT BE. TWO THREE

03:21:57.572 --> 03:21:58.906
FOR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.

03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:01.709
AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS WHATEVER

03:22:01.776 --> 03:22:04.846
YOU HAVE ZONE FOR WITH HIGH BALK

03:22:04.912 --> 03:22:06.681
AND DENSITY -- YOU NEED TO ALLOW

03:22:06.747 --> 03:22:08.816
PEOPLE TO PUT BEDROOMS AND

03:22:08.883 --> 03:22:10.251
CONSISTENT WITH THE BUILDING

03:22:10.318 --> 03:22:11.853
CODE UNDER THAT BOOK PRINT THAT

03:22:11.919 --> 03:22:14.422
YOU'VE ESTABLISHED LOCALLY --

03:22:14.489 --> 03:22:16.924
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

03:22:16.991 --> 03:22:17.925
I DO APPRECIATE THOSE

03:22:17.992 --> 03:22:20.027
CLARIFICATIONS BECAUSE WHEN WHEN

03:22:20.094 --> 03:22:20.828
YOU READ THROUGH ESPECIALLY THE

03:22:20.895 --> 03:22:22.497
MEN AND A BILL THAT TAKES OUT

03:22:22.563 --> 03:22:25.233
THE THE THE LEGAL FEES THAT WAS

03:22:25.299 --> 03:22:27.101
THAT WAS A NO GO FOR FOR ME AND

03:22:27.168 --> 03:22:28.469
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

03:22:28.536 --> 03:22:29.904
SO I'LL BE VOTING YESTERDAY AND

03:22:29.971 --> 03:22:31.172
YOU KNOW AS LONG AS IT STAYS

03:22:31.239 --> 03:22:32.740
THIS WAY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

03:22:32.807 --> 03:22:34.242
TO CONSIDER SOME SORT OF A

03:22:34.308 --> 03:22:35.676
MOMENT MAKES CLARIFICATIONS FOR

03:22:35.743 --> 03:22:36.844
WITH CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THAT

03:22:36.911 --> 03:22:38.012
BEDROOM REQUIREMENT.

03:22:38.079 --> 03:22:40.848
I THINK THAT IS VERY CONFUSING

03:22:40.915 --> 03:22:41.716
FOR FOR FOLKS WHEN THEY READ IT

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:42.483
SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU

03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:44.919
CAN CONSIDER.

03:22:44.986 --> 03:22:46.153
AND AS IT STAYS LIKE THIS OFF I

03:22:46.220 --> 03:22:47.121
GUESS ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU

03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:51.259
WILL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT

03:22:51.325 --> 03:22:51.826
THAT LANGUAGE MAKE SURE IT'S

03:22:51.893 --> 03:22:52.527
CLEAR.

03:22:52.593 --> 03:22:54.462
SO REMEMBER LACKEY.

03:22:54.529 --> 03:22:55.596
YES TO THE CHAIR IF I COULD JUST

03:22:55.663 --> 03:22:58.633
ASK A A QUESTION IF I COULD HAVE --

03:22:58.699 --> 03:22:59.834
SANDY GEORGE COME BACK AND SPEAK

03:22:59.901 --> 03:23:01.202
TO THE ISSUE OF MINISTERIAL

03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:03.237
PERMITTING BECAUSE I I FEEL LIKE.

03:23:03.304 --> 03:23:05.673
THE GOOD SENATOR SENSE OF THE

03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:08.276
HAS MADE THAT CONFUSED ON SURE

03:23:08.342 --> 03:23:09.510
NOW WHAT THAT HAS.

03:23:09.577 --> 03:23:10.878
TO IT'S A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE

03:23:10.945 --> 03:23:11.479
VERY IMPORT PART OF THIS BILL

03:23:11.546 --> 03:23:26.060
FOR ME.

03:23:26.127 --> 03:23:26.360
YES I HAVE.

03:23:26.427 --> 03:23:27.295
YOU VOICE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE

03:23:27.361 --> 03:23:28.162
MINISTERIAL PERMITTING AND IF

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:29.597
YOU COULD JUST EXPAND ON THAT

03:23:29.664 --> 03:23:30.131
REAL QUICKLY AND HELP ME

03:23:30.197 --> 03:23:31.465
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF I'M

03:23:31.532 --> 03:23:34.035
GETTING KIND OF CONFLICTING

03:23:34.101 --> 03:23:34.602
INFORMATION FROM GOOD CENTER

03:23:34.669 --> 03:23:36.203
THERE.

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.438
I DON'T THINK YEAH.

03:23:37.505 --> 03:23:38.706
I DON'T THINK WE'RE ON A

03:23:38.773 --> 03:23:40.575
DIFFERENT PAGE THERE I THINK

03:23:40.641 --> 03:23:41.342
IT'S THE WAY THE AMENDMENT WAS

03:23:41.409 --> 03:23:43.077
WRITTEN BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED

03:23:43.144 --> 03:23:44.478
TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:45.780
PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT THE HA

03:23:45.846 --> 03:23:46.981
IF THEY HAVE.

03:23:47.048 --> 03:23:48.716
MINISTERIAL PERMITS THAT THOSE

03:23:48.783 --> 03:23:50.585
MINISTERIALES PERMITS WOULD BE

03:23:50.651 --> 03:23:51.886
SUBJECT TO THE PENALTIES NATURE

03:23:51.953 --> 03:23:53.187
A IF THEY WERE VIOLENCE OF FOOD

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:54.455
IF YOU DELAY THEM WE DON'T

03:23:54.522 --> 03:23:55.756
APPROVE THEM.

03:23:55.823 --> 03:23:58.192
THAT WOULD BE -- A VIOLATION

03:23:58.259 --> 03:24:00.428
UNDER THE HA AS IT IS NOW THOUGH

03:24:00.494 --> 03:24:02.063
YOU CAN'T SEPARATE BETWEEN

03:24:02.129 --> 03:24:03.230
MINISTERIAL PERMITS AND A

03:24:03.297 --> 03:24:04.565
PROJECT THAT HAS MISTER REAL

03:24:04.632 --> 03:24:05.366
PERMITS.

03:24:05.433 --> 03:24:06.634
SO ACTUALLY ADDS EVERY

03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:08.803
MINISTERIAL PERMIT ITSELF NO

03:24:08.869 --> 03:24:11.272
MATTER WHAT PROJECT INTO THE HA

03:24:11.339 --> 03:24:12.873
AND HA REQUIRES ANYTHING THAT

03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:14.642
YOU DO -- IMPOSE ON A

03:24:14.709 --> 03:24:16.310
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TO HAVE

03:24:16.377 --> 03:24:18.012
EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND THOSE

03:24:18.079 --> 03:24:20.781
MINISTERIAL OF PERMITS ARE JUST

03:24:20.848 --> 03:24:22.883
A A CHECKLIST OF THINGS YOU

03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:23.618
CHECK THEM OFF.

03:24:23.684 --> 03:24:25.152
AND YOU GET THE PERMIT AT THE

03:24:25.219 --> 03:24:25.853
END OF THE PROCESS IT'S NOT

03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:28.689
REALLY DISCRETIONARY.

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:30.524
VENTURE BY IF I MAY ADD TO THAT.

03:24:30.591 --> 03:24:31.192
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

03:24:31.258 --> 03:24:32.827
A P. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

03:24:32.893 --> 03:24:33.861
TO MAKE SURE THE BILL IS DOING

03:24:33.928 --> 03:24:35.863
WHAT WE INTEND I BELIEVE IT PAYS

03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:36.831
DISTINGUISHING.

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:38.065
BETWEEN LET THEM MINISTER A

03:24:38.132 --> 03:24:40.234
PERMIT FOR A LIKE FOR A PROJECT

03:24:40.301 --> 03:24:41.969

THIRTY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE

03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:43.004
THAT.

03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:44.972
BIRTH IS SORT OF A MORE MINOR

03:24:45.039 --> 03:24:46.807
MINISTERIAL PERMIT SO WILL

03:24:46.874 --> 03:24:49.043
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A PA -- TO

03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:50.811
TRY TO MAKE SURE TO SEE IF WE

03:24:50.878 --> 03:24:53.681
CAN -- OCT CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE

03:24:53.748 --> 03:24:55.282
AND JUST CLARIFY TO THAT UNDER

03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:57.418
THE HA THERE'S DIFFERENT CIVIL

03:24:57.485 --> 03:24:59.387
COLD PROCEDURES FOR MINISTERIAL

03:24:59.453 --> 03:25:01.889
DISCRETIONARY PER PERMITS -- AND

03:25:01.956 --> 03:25:03.624
ACTIONS AND YOU CAN'T COMBINE

03:25:03.691 --> 03:25:04.759
THE TWO JUST BY.

03:25:04.825 --> 03:25:06.260
TRYING TO DO THAT SO WE ALSO

03:25:06.327 --> 03:25:07.194
WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE STILL

03:25:07.261 --> 03:25:09.764
ARE INTACT IN THEIR SEPARATE SO

AMENDMENT BUT WHERE THIS WILL

03:25:11.799 --> 03:25:13.200
COME INTO PLAY IS IF YOU GOT THE

PROJECT.
