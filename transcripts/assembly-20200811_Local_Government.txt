WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. I'M ASSUMING THE MICROPHONE IS ON YOU CAN HEAR ME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN TWENTY. THIS BILL ALLOWS PROPERTY OWNERS TO HAVE DUPLEXES AND SUBDIVIDE THEIR PROPERTY IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME NEIGHBORHOOD STATEWIDE AS LONG AS THESE NEW UNITS MEET EXISTING COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS. SB ELEVEN TWENTY BUILT ON ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. WHICH IS LED TO A QUADRUPLING OF APPLICATIONS IN MOST METRO AREAS AND THE PERMITTING OF THOUSANDS OF NATURALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION RECENTLY FOUND THAT IF JUST 5% OF THE PARCELS ELIGIBLE UNDER THE BILL CREATED NEW TO UNIT STRUCTURES. IT WOULD RESULT IN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOMES ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CONSTRUCTION GOAL OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. FURTHERMORE THE SMALL SCALE NATURE OF THESE HOUSING UNITS MAKES CONSTRUCTION MORE ACHIEVABLE WHILE BUILDING EQUITY FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO WISH TO BECOME PARTNERS IN SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS CRISIS. THE BILL CLEARLY RESPECTS THE PRIORITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS BY REQUIRING THAT HOMEOWNERS MEET SPECIFIC A SPECIFIC LIST. OF REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT LOCAL ZONING AND DESIGN STANDARDS HISTORIC DISTRICTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND EXISTING TENANTS VULNERABLE TO DISPLACEMENT. SB ELEVEN TWENTY AS PART OF OUR SENATE'S HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE WHICH MAKES MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION POSSIBLE EVEN WHILE WE CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH THE NEW REALITIES IN UNCERTAIN TIMES CALLS BY THE PANDEMIC. AND OUR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AUTHOR MINUTES BEFORE YOU TODAY INCLUDE LANGUAGE TO BETTER ALIGN THE TWO SECTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER ADD CLARIFICATIONS TO EASE IMPLEMENTATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ADD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN TRACK THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BILL I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL AS ENVISIONED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND I STRIKES A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO FEEL THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. AND THOSE WHO FEEL THAT IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME COMMUNITIES REMAIN CONCERNED. ABOUT PHYSICAL CHANGES THIS MIGHT BRING TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR THEIR DISTRICT. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR CONCERNS TO HEART AND HAVE WORKED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT HEIGHT SETBACKS DESIGN REVIEW. AND THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE NECESSARY ON SITE IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROTECTED. NEVER BEFORE HAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEEN SUCH A CRITICAL ISSUE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IT REMAINS SO. OVERCROWDING UNAFFORDABLE RENTS HOMELESSNESS THESE ARE ALL SYMPTOMS OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS LONG BEFORE COVE IN NINETEEN. WITH THESE ISSUES EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC THE CREATION OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS NOW A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. I THINK THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO BE PRESENT AND STEP IN WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S VOICES ARE HEARD. TO WORK WITH EVERYONE ON A COMPROMISE. AND ULTIMATELY MOVE THE NEEDLE FORWARD THROUGH LEGISLATION LIKE SB ELEVEN TWENTY- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THERE IS QUITE A LIST OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ELEVEN TWENTY. AND I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THAT LIST BUT I THINK I'D RATHER HEAR. FROM YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES- THIS HAS BEEN A COMPLICATED PROCESS MONTHS OF DISCUSSION. MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION AND YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE AND OF THE WITNESS OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE LARA. DELVIN VALENCIA. AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. MODERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE. OPEN THE PHONE FOR LAUREN EPIC. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FORMED A VOLUNTEER REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO JOIN SENATE PRO TEM ABSENT TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AT ELEVEN TWENTY I WE ALSOREALLY WANT TO THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS YEAR SENATE HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE THAT'S ELEVEN TWENTY REQUIRED BECAUSE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CONTAINING TWO RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO BE CONSIDERED MINISTERIAL YOU BUT THEN I THINK THANGAL FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DOWN. AND ALSO REQUIRES MINISTERIAL APPROVAL OF THE PARCEL MAP OR TENTATIVE AND FINAL MAP FOR URBAN LOT SPLIT THE PARCELS AND RESIDENTIAL DOWN. TO THIRTEEN CONDITIONS ARE MET. HOW PRODUCTION TODAY HAVE FOR. ON CHEN LARGE. MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS AND SMALLER EIGHTY YEARS. BOTH OF COURSE ARE IMPORTANT PRODUCT TYPES BUT THEY DO NOT ADDRESS THE NEED FOR SMALLER SCALE DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN COME OUT MIDDLE INCOME HOMEOWNERSHIP OR ALTERNATIVE RENTAL HOUSING TYPE. AND S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY. RIGHT THAT MAKING THREE MONEY BENEFIT FOR SMALL SCALE DEVELOPMENT BY ADDING MUCH NEEDED HOUSING CHOICE IS AN EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY FOUND THAT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE DENSITY INCREASES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR LOCAL CONTACT. FAVORED LEVINE HOUSING TYPES AND PREDOMINANTLY SINGLE FAMILY FILMS HAVE ALREADY PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN MANY JURISDICTIONS. AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF EXAMPLE THE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR EXAMPLE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE DUPLEXES AND OTHER MULTI FAMILY PROJECT YOU'VE ADDED BOTH RENTAL AND FOR SALE UNITS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE. AND THEY PROVIDE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR WHERE PEOPLE TO LIVE. SO THE ELEVEN TWENTY PROVIDE THE PROPERTIES THAT WILL STREAMLINE THIS TYPE OF NEW HOUSING SUPPLY AND IMPOSE IMPORTANT CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE MET FOR DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL. THESE UNITS MUST BE LOCATED IN INFILL AREAS COMPLY WITH LOCAL STANDARDS THAT DON'T PRECLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO UNITS. AND AVOID PROTECTED AND SENSITIVE HABITATS AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES SAFEGUARDS DIFFERENT PREVENT THE LOSS OF EXISTING HOUSING OR DISPLACEMENT OF POTENTIAL VULNERABLE TENANTS. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT CITY OR COUNTY MAY APPLY ITS LOCAL OBJECTIVE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND LOTS OF DINNER BUT PREVENTIVE CONSTRUCTION ABOUT THE TWO UNITS. ON EITHER OF THE RESULT RESULT IN MOCK WHAT PERSONAL. THIS ARE CRITICAL THAT'S THE CRITERIA SIMILAR TO OTHER RECENT POSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT TO BUILD A DENSER PROJECTS WHAT THE ALLOWING VOCAL OBJECTIVE STANDARDS TO APPLY AND EITHER REALLY IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT YOU CAN'T CALIFORNIA SUPPORT.

RIGHT NOW IS LINE TO FIFTY THEY HAVE DISCONNECTED FROM IT WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE THAT PARTICIPATED THIS MORNING I WOULD LIKE TO ASK- IF ANY OF OUR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE SENATOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NO NO. MATTER SPEAKER PRO TEM I AM. I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION ON THE MORE ON THE FOUR PLEXUS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE DUPLEXES IN THOSE AREAS AS IT WAS THERE STILL DIALOGUE HAPPENING WITHIN THE BUILDING TRADES- AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. I AM AWARE THAT- WE HAVE GOTTEN A RECENT COMMENTS FROM. SOME OF THE BUILDING- COMMUNITY AND- WE JUST BECAME AWARE OF THAT SO. AS IT RELATES TO THE QUESTION WE WILL OBVIOUSLY CHECK IN WITH THEM WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. OBVIOUSLY COMMENTS STILL COMING IN BUT- I'M PREPARED TO LOOK AT WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME AND I THINK JUST THIS MORNING. IN TERMS OF THE FOUR PLEXUS- YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN- QUITE A BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT. WHAT'S ALLOWED SO LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR RIGHT NOW EXISTING LAW SAYS. I YOU CAN HAVE TWO UNITS ONE PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND ONE EIGHTY YOU BASED ON OUR A. D. LAW. LEGISLATION SB ELEVEN TWENTY- WITH NO EXISTING EIGHTY YOU ON THE PROPERTY CURRENTLY FOUR UNITS TWO DUPLEXES A LOT SPLIT TO INTO. ELEVEN TWENTY EXISTING A DO YOU ON THE PROPERTY ALREADY FOR TWO DUPLEXES THE EIGHTY YOU BECOMES A PRIMARY RESIDENCE ONCE THE LOT IS SPLIT. THE LOT SPLIT AND A DO YOU FOR TWO PRIMARY RESIDENCES AND TWO EIGHTY USE. DUPLEX IN A D. U. THREE ONE DUPLEX ONE EIGHTY YOU SO FOR OUR IN ALL OF THOSE CASES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DUPLEX EXISTING AND A D. U. THREE. SO THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE AND I UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE GET CONFUSED WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF LEGISLATION AND OUR ATTEMPTS TO PUT PARAMETERS AND TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THE- THE CRITERIA. BUT YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THINGS FROM TWELVE UNITS STATE NOW FOUR AND THREE WITH THE DUPLEX AND IDEA TO BE CLEAR AND IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION YOU ASKED WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE AMENDMENTS AND RICK AND SUGGESTIONS AS WE LEAVE HERE BETWEEN NOW AND APPROPRIATIONS WE WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU DIRECTLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THE FURTHER DISCUSSION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUCKY YEAH MINE'S NOT A QUESTION LINES JUST AND AN EXPLANATION OF MY VOTE. I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR. DIFFERENT REASONS THE EXPRESSED OVER THE PHONE FACT IS I'M QUITE. AMUSED AND THANKFUL FOR THE COMPROMISE IN THE AND THE SUPPORTERS THE PLURALITY AND THE UNUSUAL A COLLECTIVE GATHERING OF OPINIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER HOUSING BILLS ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT. BUT ALL OF US AGREE THAT OUR HOUSING SITUATION IS IN A CRISIS. AND SO WHERE DO WE SEEM TO BE A STALEMATE EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING REASONABLE. AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT CAN'T BOTH THE WAY I WANT TO VOTE BECAUSE MY DISTRICT IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND THERE ARE MANY TIMES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIMES RIGHT VOTE DIFFERENTLY. THEN I MY PERSONAL OPINION. MY DISTRICT HAS OVERWHELMINGLY. GIVEN ME A ROBUST RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION PREDICTABLY SO YOU GOTTA REMEMBER DESK IS OPEN ON THE BEGINNING OF THE DESERT RIGHT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE VERY SICK. IN THE MINDS OF MY RESIDENTS MOST MY RESIDENTS. IN MY DISTRICT IS SO ANYTIME THERE'S A DENSITY INCREASE. OF RELAXATION. IT'S SUPPOSED REALLY STRONGLY AS WHEN I WAS ON CITY COUNCIL THAT'S WHAT DREW ALL THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNCIL MEETINGS IN PROTEST AS WHEN WE HAD ANY KIND OF- PROPOSAL TO INCREASE DENSITY IN IT THAN A- RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT AND SO IT'S VERY PREDICTABLE BUT I. THERE WAS A VOTE THIS THAT TRIGGERED A LOT OF RESPONSE AND SO NONETHELESS I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I THINK YOU YOUR IF I WAS VOTING NAY I WOULD GLADLY SUPPORT BUT I WOULD BE BETRAYING THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE TO MY DISTRICT AND SO I FEEL COMPELLED TO. ANSWER THAT CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUCKY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US. THANK YOU- MADAM PRO TEM FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL AND HOUSING PRODUCTION I KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND TO- SEVERAL SENATORS- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A HOUSING. YOU KNOW AND WHICH IS FEEDING INTO OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON- I DIDN'T TALK- TWO GROUPS OF MY CONSTITUENTS THAT HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL- AND WHEN IT WHICH THEY ALSO HAVE HAD CONCERNS ON EIGHTY USE- IN THE PAST BUT- MAINLY THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED THIS TIME WERE AROUND WILDFIRES OWNS- EVEN THOUGH I. YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS AN URBAN AREA IT'S PART OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- PARTS OF IT ARE ALONG THE FOOTHILLS- LIKE ESPECIALLY THE SUNLAND TUJUNGA AREA WHICH IS A COMMUNITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND BUT I DID VERIFY THAT THAT AREA WAS DESIGNATED RIGHT AS A FIRE HAZARD ZONE WHICH I BELIEVE THAT. YOUR BILL. THIS WOULDN'T APPLY THIS. I JUST WANT TO COME THAT THAT'S THE- THAT YOU- YOU ARE RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER VERY FIRE- PRONE AREAS ARE EXEMPT IN THIS BILL- THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST THAT WE ALSO EXEMPT LOW YOU KNOW OTHER LESSER DEGREE OF HIGH FIRE. ZONES LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENSURE- HOW DEVELOPMENT OCCURS IN- THOSE LESSER ZONES BUT LEAD BENEATH VERY HIGH FIRE ZONES MY WHOLE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS LISTED- MUCH LIKE LARGE PARTS OF LOS ANGELES- THAT IS THE PART THAT IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE OTHER THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISION THEY'RE ABOUT HOW BEST TO BUILD IN THOSE AREAS SO VERY HOT FIRE AREAS EXEMPT- BELOW THAT CATEGORY IT'S LEFT TO LOCAL DISCRETION TO DETERMINE HOW TO BUILD IN THOSE AREAS. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE- I HAVE A MOTION. FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS DO I HAVE A SECOND. SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AND I'M SURE YOU'VE GIVEN ME A GREAT DEAL OF TIME SO LET ME BE VERY QUICK AND JUST THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR BEING WILLING TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME TO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS AND THE SUPPORT EXPRESSED BY THE WITNESSES TODAY I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WITNESSES MANY OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED WE HEARD DURING THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF DISCUSSION AND TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF PRODUCTION BILLS. AROUND I WOULD JUST SAY YOU MORE THAN ANYONE UNDERSTANDS AS OUTLINED BY THE VICE CHAIRMAN THE COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO DO- LEGISLATION AROUND HOUSING WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND SUBSIDIES PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY REGULATION AND SEEK WORK ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ISSUES ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS YOUR BODY AND THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. HAS PRODUCED SOME INCREDIBLE PACKAGES OF HOUSING BILLS WE CONTINUE THE ASSEMBLY DOES THE SENATE DOES TO TRY TO FIND THE SPOT IN WHICH WE ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. IF MONEY AND SUBSIDIES WERE THE THING THAT WOULD GET US A PRODUCTION AND MORE HOUSING UNITS FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY EASIER IT WASN'T PREVIOUSLY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN EASIER TO FIND SUBSIDIES IN MONEY IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION ISSUE THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE IN WAYS THAT ARE- APPROPRIATE WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS- CITIES AND COMMUNITIES- I HEARD A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE EXPRESSED I WOULD URGE US TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO EDUCATE OUR CONSTITUENTS MANY OF THE FIERCELY EXPRESSED WE TAKING CARE OF IN TERMS OF. ALLOWING THE LOCAL JRISDICTIONS TO PUT THE PARAMETERS AND THE SUSPENDERS AROUND IT WE OF YOU KNOW APPRECIATE SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS I LIVE IN A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH WE STARTED TO SEE A D USE AND OTHER THINGS IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT SPECULATION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS S. AND I. WILL JUST SAY. THIS BILL WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S AFFORDABILITY ONE EIGHTY USE CAME ONLINE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE DATA COMPILED. BY IS THAT EIGHTY USE RENT AT BELOW MARKET RATES. 62% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. THE BILL SPECIFICALLY LIMITS INDIVIDUALS FROM RECEIVING MINISTERO LOT SPLITS ON ADJACENT PARCELS AS A WAY OF PREVENTING INVESTOR SPECULATION. SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- THIS IS TOO CRUDE TO CORRECT A PROBLEM OF. OF SUPPLY THE BILL FURTHR BANS PROPERTIES WERE TENET HAS RESIDED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH ANY DEMOLITION. OF THE EXISTING RESIDENTS. TO PREVENT PROFITEERING INDIVIDUALS FROM EVICTING EXISTING TENANTS SO. I COULD GO ON BUT YOU'VE GIVEN ME SO MUCH TIME I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS UNDERSTAND WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. WITH THAT- THIS IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING READY TO HEAR ANOTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES BILLS- SB THIRTY EIGHTY FIVE. I WANT. WE MAIN INTEREST IN WORKING WITH YOU. I AND THIS ASSEMBLY TO CONTINUE TO DO A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT TRIES TO ADDRESS THE BROADEST DEGREE OF CONCERNS.

AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU IS MEMBERS KNOW THAT AS THE LEADER OF THE SENATE I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ALL OF THESE BILLS RELATED TO HOUSING WHETHER IT'S THE ASSEMBLY BILLS OR THE SENATE BILLS TO SEE IF WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. THAT IS TRUE ONE THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AS WELL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TOP THANK YOU. K. WELCOMES CENTER COVER GYRO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET ME FIRST OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO YOU AND THE STAFF FOR A THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT'S THAT'S GOT INTO IT UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THE- COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AND TODAY I WILL ACCEPT ALMOST ALL OF THESE AMENDMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO ARTICULATE WHICH ONES I WILL AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE ONE AND A HALF IT'S LEFT I'M WILLING TO DO TAT AS WELL. ONE IS TO REMOVE THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO SB THIRTY FIVE. TWO IS LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL THE PARCELS THAT ARE NOT ADJACENT TO INDUSTRIAL USES THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION. THREE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO PARCELS LOCATED IN URBANIZED AREA CLUSTERS FOR THE REALLOCATION OF EXEMPTS SITES ON PARCELS THATARE NOT IDENTIFIED AS AREAS SUCH AS PRIME FARMLAND COASTAL ZONES WETLAND HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES THEY'RE IDENTIFIED BY CODE SECTION SO I DIDN'T SAY THE CODE SECTION BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. NEXT IS TO REQUIRED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS THE NEXT IS ADDING A SUNSET TO THE BILL THERE IS A DISPUTE ON WHAT DATE WOULD INCLUDE. ALL OF THE- INSURER ALL OF THE CLOCKS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SIXTH CYCLE THE RENO CYCLE AND SO- WE BELIEVE IT'S THIRTY TWO YOU BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY SIX IF IT'S TWENTY SIX I'M OKAY WITH THAT- AND THEN STRIKING THAT CFD PROVISIONS- THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT. THAT I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT. SO AS AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE AN EXTREME. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY THE STATE MUST INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR. YET THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE MANY OF OUR CITIES ARE BUILT OUT AND DON'T HAVE READILY AVAILABLE VACANT LAND AND OTHER CITIES. ARE RELUCTANT TO DEVELOP HOUSING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THEIR JURISDICTIONS WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD BE. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TAKES A COMP CONCEPT ARTICULATED IN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. BY SENATOR STEINBERG TO DEVELOP DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND TO REUSE AND ADAPT UNDERPERFORMING PROPERTIES TO CREATE WALKABLE COMMUNITIES AND AVOID SPRAWL. THIS ADAPTED REDUCE BILL WILL SPUR OF BURKE HOUSING PRODUCTION BY AUTHORIZING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS. ON EXISTING LOTS CURRENTLY ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL USE SUCH AS STRIP MALLS ARE LARGE RETAIL SPACES. THE BILL WILL ALSO SOLVE AND EVOLVING CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH IS SHIFTED BUSINESS TO ACCEPT NEW WORK FROM HOME STRATEGIES AND EXPANDED ONLINE TRANSACTIONS FOR COMMERCIAL RETAIL. NUMEROUS MAISCHAK MAJOR COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY MAY BE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY OR CLOSING STORES SUCH AS SEARS J. C. PENNEY'S KMART TOYS R. US. ALL OF US HAVE THESE COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS. AND THAT'S DUE TO THE DECLINE. CONSUMER PRESS OVER TIME WHICH IS LEFT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH STRIP MALLS AND MALLS WITH MAJOR TENANT VACANCIES WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE OF THE RETAIL CENTER INCREASING BLIGHT VANDALISM DECLINING SALES TAX REVENUE. IN MY DISTRICT THESE RETAILERS ARE OUR MAJOR TENANTS AND I EXPECT TO SEE MANY MORE. OF THESE RETAILERS LEAVE AS THE ECONOMY STRUGGLES IN ADDITION MANY CORPORATE ENTERPRISES ARE FOR GOING THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR OPERATIONS IN FAVOR OF A NEW WORK FROM HOME REALITY. THESE UNDER UTILIZED OR VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACES ARE ALONG MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ROUTES AND CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACREAGE AVAILABLE TO BE DEVELOPED FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE A WALKABLE LIVE WORK PLAY VILLAGE. THE WALKABLE VILLAGE CONSTABLE ALSO HELP TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE TRIPS BY ALLOCATING SERVICES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF PEOPLE'S HEALTH. MOST SIMPLY SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPROVE RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIALLY ZONED RETAIL R OFFICE SPACE REQUIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MEET OR EXCEED THE DENSITY DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SUCH AS APARTMENTS TOWNHOMES AND CONDOMINIUMS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL DECISION. MAKING BY SUBJECTING TO DEVELOP TO LOOK PLANNING PARKING AND DESIGN OR- WITH NO COST TO THIS. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL INCENTIVIZE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS BY GIVING LAND OWNER AND DEVELOPERS WAIT A WAY TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING. THE BILL ALSO SPUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY DURING A RECESSION IN REGION'S MOST IN NEED TO RE VIOLATE REVITALIZATION AND AS A STEP TOWARDS ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. SB EIGHT THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS SUPPORTED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA FORWARD CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY THE CALIFORNIA YIMBY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND WESTFIELD.

ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. FIVE THOUSAND HOUSING IS AN ALLOWABLE USE ON PROPERTY. ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL THE BILL WILL INCREASE XCELERATED NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION. IN STRATEGIC SPACES THAT ARE OFTEN PRIME LAND CLOSE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. SO THIS.

THIS IS THE ENTERTAIN A MOTION. LOOK AT THE MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUCKY. THE SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN- WE'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THE- CENTER COVER YOUR- WHO CLOSING STATEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED- REMOTELY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY AND I AND I APPRECIATE IT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. I'M A SERVICE POLICY. I GOT ELECTED TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS THAT REALLY ARE IMPORTANT IN MY DISTRICT AND MY DISTRICT IS A RURAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CITIES AND FRANKLY TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WORKS IN REAL CALIFORNIAN WORKS IN THE CITIES AND THE SUBURBS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION TO WORK EVERY. AND WE HAVE SPENT. THAT THIS THIS WORK WAS DONE. WITH THAT- BENEFIT OF A OF A GROUP OF US AND- I WOULD VENTURE TO BE REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT HOUSING SITUATIONS AND IT'S A COMPROMISE OF ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT FROM THEIR DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND YOU SEE WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE LISTED AS- CO AUTHORS ON THE BILL- THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART OF OUR OF OUR WORKING GROUP AND THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING. ONCE PASSED THE COVERT NIGHT. IS HOUSING THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ANY HOUSING AT ALL HAS REALLY CREATED THE SITUATION WHERE YOU SEE COBIT IS RAGING. IN THE FARMWORKERS COMMUNITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN REALLY SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED SITUATIONS SO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME AND ONE OF THE ISSUES. IT WILL AND WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ARE WHAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A NEW DENSITY BONUS. LAW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT- TO. YOU SAY THAT ARE WORKING AND CITY BONUS LEGISLATION THAT DE BONE. GOING SET SOME AFFORDABLE CRITERIA THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE TO FOLLOW AND SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A- MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT- DENSITY BONUS AND I. ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT- AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THE NUMBER TWO ISSUE OUT BEYOND THAT. IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE'S A DESPERATE NEED IN MY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT DURING THE GOOD TIMES OF THE YEAR. TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL EIGHT. ON UP. A JOB GOOD PAYING. AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IS TRYING TO MEET OUR OF OUR HOUSING. ISSUEAT AND OUR JOBS JOBS ISSUE AND DO IT IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T CREATE VACANCIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TO BE BOARDED UP. THAT ATTRACT BLIGHT. AND THE KIND OF VANDALISM THAT HAS FIVE FIREFIGHTERS WORRIED BECAUSE THEN YOU END UP WITH THE FIRE SO MY POINT ABOUT ALL OF THAT. THAT IS THAT. WE'VE FULLY BOOKED AT. MOMENT TENSING. BY THE WE'VE WE'VE- A- 95% FROM AND- AND- YEAH EUROPE TODAY CONTAIN HIS THIS SENSE TO MAKE THAT WE GET THE BILL THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY. I'M SORRY WITH AND ANY CLOSER WOULD SAY THAT I WAS VERY HONORED TO HAVE BIPARTISAN- COOPERATION ON THIS BILL AND- AND THE FACT THAT IT WORKS AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES IS TESTAMENT. TO THE HARD WORK- OF THE OF THE GROUP THAT'S ON IT. IT'S OVER SHELTER PLACE COULDN'T SEE EACH OTHER BUT WE MET ON THE PHONE EVERY WEEK FOR A SERIES OF HOURS SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOU- YOUR VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TODAY TODAY TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS CASE AND TO KEEP IT MOVING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. YOU KNOW THIS IS TOUGH ON ME AND I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO USE VACANT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS TO HELP US SOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CRISIS IF THE ENTIRETY OF WHAT WOULD THE BILL DID I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS MUCH BROADER IN SCOPE. WE HAVE WORKED HARD OVER SEVERAL YEARS TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THE RENEWAL PROCESS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS JUST LARA LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ZONE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HOUSING. AND THEY DO SO IN A WAY THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROP PRINCIPLES. LOCALS ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING THE REVISED ARENA NUMBERS AND REZONING FOR MORE PARCELS FOR HOUSING. I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL SHIFTS THE GOALPOSTS ON THEM AND ENCOURAGES SPRAWL BY ALLOWING HOUSING ON UNDEVELOPED COMMERCIALLY ZONED LAND WITH NO INFILL CONTROLS. I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF. THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES WE HEARD TODAY. THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACES THE NEED FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVISION IN THIS BILL WAS CONCERNING. FINALLY AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED I AM ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF SB THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINING BEYOND RESIDENTIAL ZONES. I CAN'T SUPPORT AN ENORMOUS EXPANSION OF THE STREAMLINING PROCESS THAT FAILS TO RESTORE THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES FROM DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO KEEP SB THIRTY FIVE FROM BEING EXTENDED OR EXPANDED UNTIL THIS INJUSTICE IS REVERSED AND FRANKLY. IF I COULD I'D REPEAL IT IT UNTIL THAT TIME. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOUR BILL OR MINE YOU ARE A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE IN AN HONORABLE PERSON BUT THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE TO ME. WE HAVE. OUR RECEIVED A COUNTER PROPOSAL TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED IN THE ANALYSIS. WELL WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS I WANT TO MOVE YOUR BILL FORD. WE CANNOT BET THIS COUNTER OFFER ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. THIS LEAVES US NO ABILITY TO CONSULT WITH THE OTHER PARTIES FROM THE ASSEMBLY THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS. I WILL MAKE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AFTER THE BUILDINGS THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE REQUESTED. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL WORK. TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BEFORE THE BILL IS VOTED ON THIS FINAL FORM. YOU JUST STATED THAT YOU WERE NOT GOING TO TAKE ALL THE AMENDMENTS COMMITTEE HAS OFFERED A MINUTE THAT I BELIEVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THEIR ISSUES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPLY THE BILL WITH ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT ALL THE AMENDMENTS I HAVE TO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMITTEE NOT SUPPORT THE BILL AND I WILL BE VOTING NO. THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OUR MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY NO AGUIAR-CURRY NO LACKEY. LACKEY III BLOOM. BOERNER HORVATH RAMOS ALMOST NO THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL VOEPEL I. PHOTOS THREE TWO AND WE RULE YES IT DOES GIVE THEM. THANK WE'LL KEEP THE ROLE BUT- OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. OKAY WE ARE MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM. FOR ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. TEN FORTY NINE SENATOR GLAZIER WELCOME. THANK YOU A ADAM SHARON MEMBERS. ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST IN MY HOMETOWN OF ORINDA. A TRAGEDY STRUCK. A. I. INDIVIDUAL HAD RENTED A SHORT TERM RENTAL THIS IS A HOUSE OBSESSIVELY TO HAVE A FAMILY REUNION. INSTEAD IT WAS TURNED INTO A- PARTY. AND THAT NIGHT FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE SHOT AND KILLED. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS IT HAPPENED AT A SHORT TERM RENTAL. IN THE LAST HALF OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FORTY TWO PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN SHOT. ENTER OUTSIDE OF RENTAL PROPERTY THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY AND SEVENTEEN HAVE DIED. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES TO DEAL WITH THESE RARE ABUSES OF SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES. THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS INTENDED TO GIVE A TOOL TO THEM. NOT A REQUIREMENT BUT A TOOL THEY CAN USE WHEN THEY HAVE SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES THAT HAVE ABUSED THE LAW TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND WHAT YOU FIND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAW TODAY IS THAT. A VIOLATION BECOMES JUST SIMPLY THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE. THAT'S IT. SO THE LEGISLATION TAKES THE EXISTING FINE LEVELS THAT ARE IN PLACE RAISES THEM UP. TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT THE FIRST VIOLATION NOT THE SECOND BUT ON RIVER IT OFFENDERS GIVING THAT TOOL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. THE LOOK I UNDERSTAND THAT SHORT TERM RENTALS. ARE ARE A WAY TO IMPROVE TOURISM TO HELP. PROPERTY OWNERS EARN SOME EXTRA MONEY. BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD ACTORS IT'S NOT THE- USUAL OCCUR THE RARE OCCURRENCE. AND SO MY WORK WITH MY LOCAL OFFICIALS IN MY LOCAL CITIES WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM JUST AN ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT'S THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL IF. THE GUIDANCE IN MAKING THIS BILL STRONGER AND BETTER. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY THE VICE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ORINDA AB WORTH. AND RICHARD LAZARO REPRESENTING THE EXPEDIA GROUP. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE WILL- NOW PUT IN THE QUEUE THE VICE MAYOR JAMIE WORTH OF CITY OF ORINDA. AHEAD UP. GOOD MORNING MATTER MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY WIRTZ VICE MAYOR VERANDA AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THE COURT OF SENATE BILL TEN FORTY NINE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE RELIEF WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MANAGING SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THEIR COMMUNITY WE ARE GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GLAZERS FOR SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION. WHEN SHORT TERM RENTAL HELPING PLATFORMS CAME INTO EXISTENCE MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO BAN THEM COMPLETELY. IN A WINDOW WE CHOSE A MORE MODERATE APPROACH TO PERMIT THEM. AND ADOPTED AN ORDINANCE THAT CLEARLY OUTLINES THE RULES. THAT INCLUDED NO RENTALS FOR LARGE PARTIES. AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT SHORT TERM RENTAL OWNERS REGISTER THEIR PROPERTY. SINCE THE ADOPTION OF OUR ORDINANCE. AFTER IT'S WORKED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS. THIS REQUIRES EXTENSIVE STAFF RESOURCES BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATIVE TOO OLD TO DO EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. LAST YEAR WE FOR STRENGTH IN OUR ORDINANCE TO RESTRICT RENTALS TO HOSTED RENTAL. WITH TWO NIGHT MINIMUM HOWEVER THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE FACE IS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RULES IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS. COMPLIANCE OF SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES WITH LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH. THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORM. HAVING ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND ENFORCE THESE REASONABLE ORDINANCES. ARENDAL LIKE MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS A GENERAL LAW CITY AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE SEPT THE STATUTORY LIMITS FOR FINE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED TO OFFER CITY THINK FOURNETTE TWO ONE FOURTH. THEIR SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES. IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE APPRECIATE THIS OF THE LOWER GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE CAN PROVIDE US WITH THE TOOLS TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES AND IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE OVER THE YEARS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE. SENATE BILL TEN FORTY NINE AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE NEXT IS RICHARD LAZARO. FROM EXPEDIA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING- ON BEHALF OF EXPEDIA GROUP OF FAMILY TRAVEL BRANDS INCLUDING VACATION ONE TO GIVE ME VACATION RENTAL LEADER VERBO AND CALLING TODAY TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL TEN FORTY NINE. EXPEDIA IS PROUD TO WORK WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA COURT BALANCED RESPONSIBLE SHORT TERM RENTAL REGULATIONS THAT MEET MEET EACH COMMUNITY'S NEEDS. THIS BILL GIVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPORTANT TOOLS TO ENFORCE THOSE REGULATIONS. WE'RE DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GLAZERS THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THIS WORK AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO ADVANCE TEN FORTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

HEARING NONE OR MOVE ON TO- QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER GLAZIER YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER MORE PROGRESS SO NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION BUT I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORD. WE HAVE A LOT OF SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND I THINK YOU ACCURATELY SAID SO MANY OF THE POSTS ARE VERY GOOD HOSTS. AND THEN YOU HAVE SOME VERY BAD ACTORS IN THOSE BAD ACTORS JUST WRAPPED NEIGHBORHOODS THEY ENDANGER LIVES AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS FOUR AND I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FORGET HIS. IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT'S EASY TO REMEMBER. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR TO FOR HER- BRINGING THIS BILL AND THAT- NOTING THAT MY HOME TOWN IS- LISTED AS IN SUPPORT- I THINK- LIKE MS BOERNER HORVATH THE- A LOT OF MY CITIES ACTUALLY- I HAVE A OF A FAIRLY LARGE SUPPLY OF A- SHOULDN'T RENTAL AND WE BELIEVE STOURTON SAYS TO DEAL I JUST WANTED TO. KIND. RIGHT NOW MY NOTES TO THE CURRENT VIOLATION AND CAN BE AN STARTS AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GOES UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND UNDER THE BILL THAT WOULD GO A START AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND GO UP TO FIVE THOUSAND AND- PER VIOLATION. THAT'S CORRECT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION THREE THOUSAND FOR THE SECOND FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE- THIRD. AND IT ALSO US ALLOWS FOR A HARDSHIP WAIVER PROCESS CASE- THERE'S BEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR SOME OTHER ISSUES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. DOES IT TOM ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- BUT TYPICALLY WHEN CODE ENFORCED AS AN ISSUE UC OR FREQUENTLY- IF IT'S NOT A CITY VIOLATE AND- WARNINGS ARE ISSUED AND THEN IT'S AFTER THE WARNING THAT- OF FINES KICK AND IS THAT A POP. BILITY UNDER UNDER THIS BILL I'M SURE THAT. I WONDER. SO YOUR QUESTION IS THERE A WARNING PROCESS FIRST. RIGHT GOOD ENFORCEMENT OFFICER- GIVE A WRITTEN WARNING OR A SOME FORM OF WARNING WARNING AND NOT- COULD FIND- SO THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO- VIOLATIONS THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND SAFETY SO IT'S NOT A CROSS THE BORDER TO OTHER. VIOLATIONS IN A COMMUNITY THIS IS FOCUSED ON A NARROWER SPACE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A COMPLETE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IS NO BUT IT'S A GOOD DISTINCTION I THINK IT'S A- DISTINCTION. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO THE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM A CELL PHONE IN HER MOUTH. THE SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOW. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS- FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD BUT TO ADDRESS THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES IN YOUR DISTRICT AND ELSEWHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PENALIZE BAD OPERATORS ARE RENTERS ESPECIALLY REPEAT OFFENDERS WITH THE FACT OF ENFORCEMENT TOOLS. I ALSO WANT TO THINK TO YOURSELF- TO YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THE INCREASE FINES FOR VIOLATIONS OF SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES ARE TARGETED TO SERIOUS VIOLATIONS AND THE VIOLATORS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A WAIVER IS A FINE POSES A FINANCIAL HARD. PLEASE SUPPORT BILL. MOTIONS TO PASS A SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS TO PASS WE ARE HI HI. ISLA LACKEY I BLOOM HI LUME BURNER BOERNER HORVATH I.

B. THIRTEEN FORTY NINE. THANK YOU MADAM HERE I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP MY PARTNER AND- FROM MY DISTRICT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHO'S PARTNERED WITH ME ON THIS BILL THIS. THIS IS A LOCAL BILL FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- IT'S SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT IS AFFECTED OTHER. COUNTIES BUT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE COUNTY. TO PUT BEFORE THEIR VOTERS. I TAX MEASURE THAT WOULD GO ABOVE THE CURRENT CEILING THAT EXISTS IN THE COUNTY. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN AT PANDEMIC WITH ENORMOUS IMPACT- IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE SOCIAL. SAFETYNET OUR FIRE PROTECTION ACTIVITIES EVERYTHING IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE SHORTFALLS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ARE FACING AND YET IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE DEMAND ON PUBLIC SERVICES HAVE NEVER BEEN. GREATER THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO AS TO WHAT I JURISDICTION CAN DO. AND CERTAINLY THE CAP ON TAXES HAS CREATED A LIMITATION NOT. THAT THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T ALLOW THE VOTERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE ISSUE ITSELF AND SO THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. THE ABILITY TO- PLACE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT ABOVE THE EXISTING CAP. AND GIVE THEIR VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS LOCAL CHOICE WHETHER THEY CAN BRING YOU REVENUES TO HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE AT A TIME AS CRITICAL AS THIS ONE. WITH THAT. WE HAVE OUR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SUPERVISOR JOHN GIOIA AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY AS WELL AS CHRISTY BALMA FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION AND I ONCE AGAIN THANK MY PARTNER- IN THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR HIS HELP ON THIS BILL AS WELL THANK YOU SIR GLAZER AND I WELCOME WITH WITNESSES.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DID YOU KNOW FIREFIGHTERS UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES DEPEND ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INVEST IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE THE MAINTENANCE OF COUNTY STREET HIGHWAYS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND OUR SAFETY NET SERVICES ARE CRITICAL FOR OVER A PUBLIC SAFETY THIS COUNTY AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. TO EXERCISE AFFECT THE AUTHORITY IN ORDER THE ADEQUATELY FUNDED FIRE DEPARTMENT AND EMS SERVICES. AS A SENATOR SO ADEQUATELY SO ELOQUENTLY I THINK THEY'RE VERY EXPRESSED-DEMAND ON THESE SERVICES HAS GONE EXPONENTIAL IN THIS PANDEMIC AND A FIREFIGHTER WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO SERVING THE PUBLIC OF THE RESULTING REVENUES WILL BE SO HELPFUL FOR THEM TO DELIVER THEIR MISSION AND THEIR UNITY SO WE'RE JUST. TODAY. THANK YOU MUCH AND THEN WILL HAVE A ONE BELIEVES. GLORIA JONES.

IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THEY'RE EXPECTING A SHORTFALL OF A HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLARS AND FOR MANY OF MY CITIES AND I KNOW IT'S THE SAME FOR YOURS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SHORTFALLS AND JUST PROVIDE THE BASIC NEEDS. AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER. THIS MEASURE DOESN'T RAISE TAXES PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME AND A FEW OF THE CALLERS DO. NO MY RELUCTANCE TO RAISE TAXES. THIS MEASURE GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE VOTERS OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY ONLY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. THE DEBATE CAN HAPPEN. FROM ALL SIDES. AND THE VOTERS THERE CAN MAKE THEIR BEST JUDGMENT BUT LET'S GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY. THIS BILL WITHOUT THIS BILL THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY.

LONG CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE LEFT HERE. SB NINE OH TWO SENATOR WIENER WELCOME. ONE SHERMAN IBM YES YOU SURE CAN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH KIND SIR I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ARE PARTICULAR TIME TO REVIEW THE BILL AND- FOR- SPEAKING WITH ME AS WELL I APPRECIATE IT- SB NINE OH TWO IS A- PURE LOCAL CONTROL- BILL- I'VE HAD SOME OTHER BILLS THAT ARE NOT LOCAL CONTROL- BILLS OBVIOUSLY NINE OH TWO IS A BILL- PROVIDES GOTTA YOU GOTTA HAVE SOME BALANCE RIGHT. GO AHEAD OF THEM ALL I. SB NINE OH TWO PROVIDES CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WITH A VOLUNTARY AND VERY POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE NEW TOOL THAT THOSE CITIES CAN. USE OR NOT USE A CITY CAN DO NOTHING. AND SB NINE OH TWO WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THAT CITY. OR A CITY CAN OFTEN IF IT BELIEVES IT APPROPRIATE. AND USE THIS TOOL- THIS TOLD ME VERY HELPFUL DESPITE THEIR COMMON IMPRESSION- DIED. CITIES OVER ONE WHICH HAS NEVER WON HIS OWN FOR MORE DENSITY FOR MORE HOUSING. BUT THAT IS NOT ACCURATE THEIR PLENTY OF THEIR CITIES THAT DON'T. BUT THERE ARE CITIES THAT DO WANT TO ZONE FOR MORE HOUSING IN PARTS OF THEIR CITY. BUT CALIFORNIA LAW. STATE LAW MAKES IT REALLY REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO DO IT. IT MAKES IT TAKE YEARS AND YEARS AGO TAKE FIVE TO TEN YEARS. TO DO EVEN A MODEST REZONING. IT CAN COST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER MONEY. TO GO THROUGH THAT YEAH I OUR PROCESS. AND IT CAN LEAD TO UNENDING LITIGATION AND SO THEY ARE CITIES THAT WANT TO ZONE FOR MORE DENSITY. IN PARTS OF OUR CITY. BUT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE SO LENGTHY EXPENSIVE AND IS GOING TO BE A LITIGATION. WHAT SB NINE OH TWO DOES. IS IT ALLOWS CITIES IF THEY CHOOSE. TO ZONE FOR UP TO TEN UNIT BUILDINGS ARE COULD BE THREE UNITS ARE FIVE UNITS RESPONDING UNITS OR TEN UNITS ARE A MIX WHATEVER THEY WIND. UP TO TEN UNITS- IN A STREAMLINED EXPEDITED WAY BY ACTION OF THEIR CITY COUNCIL. THIS ARE EXCLUDES SPRAWL THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT- SO THE- THIS TOOL IS LIMITED TO AREAS THAT ARE NEAR. TRANSIT ORIENTED JOB RICH AREA OR AN INFILL AREAS SO WE DON'T WANT TO BE GIVING CITIES. MORE TOOLS TO HAVE MORE SPRAWL WE WANTED TO BE A SUSTAINABLE AND SERVICE. TO UTILIZE THIS TOOL. THE PROMPTLY- INCREASE ERROR ZONE HOUSING ABOUT CITY. WE HAVE AN EFFECT TWO YEARS AGO I WAS IN THIS COMMITTEE- BEFORE THE CHAIR AND- I THINK THERE ARE SOME. DIFFERENCES IN THE COMMITTEE COMPOSITION AT THE TIME WITH SB EIGHT TO EIGHT- WHICH CHANGE HOW WE CALCULATE RINA. AN INCREASE THIS CITIES HOUSING GOALS NOT IS PLAYING OUT NOW. IN THAT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE RENO WAS NOT MEETING OUR ACTUAL HOUSING NEEDS. IT IS NOW MUCH CLOSER TO DOING SO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE ABOUT TO GO TO THE PROPOSITION THAT. THAT'S GOOD. WE'RE TELLING SAID WE WANT YOU TO BUILDING HOUSING. BUT THERE WERE MADE HARD FOR THEM TO ZONE IT THE ZONE TO DO SO SB NINE OH TWO WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITIES TO DO SO. I WANT TO- JUST MAKE ONE THING VERY VERY CLEAR SB NINE OH TWO DOES NOT CHANGE HOW INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE APPROVED. SB NINE OH TWO IS ABOUT THE ZONING THAT ON PAPER AND IN THE MUNICIPAL CODE. PROT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WILL STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER PROCESS EXISTS NOW WHETHER THAT IS A SECRET DISCRETIONARY PROCESS OR STREAMLINED PROCESS. OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THIS DOES NOT CHANGE ON. OUR FINALLY- I WANT TO THANK OUR MEMBERS FOR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BILL- AND SO IT'S A BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS I DO WANT TO CAN. I TO IMPLEMENT THAT I WILL TAKE WEEKS TO TAKEN COMMITTEE WAS AUTHOR MEMBERS WERE TAKEN AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- AND THOSE ARE OUR FIRST TO PROVIDE. GLUED VERY HIGH RISK- ZONES AND THEN SECONDS- TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW I CITY COUNCILS- TO IMPACT OF VOTER ADOPTED- ZONING RESTRICTIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THOSE BALLOT MEASURES AND WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR NOT GOOD YOU CAN DO IT SEPARATELY IT DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN THOUGH STILL SO WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE CITY COUNCILS WHEN IT WILL TO.

AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PRIOR BILL S. B. THIRTY FIVE. YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S ONGOING DIALOGUE TO HOPEFULLY FIX SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. AND SO MY QUESTION ON THIS BILL- AND I SEE IT. IN HERE- AS FAR AS EXEMPTING- SOME OF THESE PROJECTS FROM SEEK WHAT. SO WOOD SB THIRTY FIVE. AND THIS BILL ARE THEY KINDA LIKE CO MINGLED. TOGETHER OR THEY SEPARATE. WELL TO BE CLEAR I THANK YOU AT SOME THEM FOR THE. THE CHAIRS BILL AB ONE SIX EIGHT. I TO CREATE A NEW. SB THIRTY FIVE TRIBAL RE WE PASS OUT PASS THAT OUR OF. THE SENATE COMMITTEE WOULD CHARGE WITH MY SERVE AND BECAUSE OF MY SAID IT PASSED OUT YOU KNOW WE DID WITHIN AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIR THAT WE WERE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO WORK FINALIZE. THE VERY SMALL NUMBER OF REMAINING ISSUES I I'M VERY UP. NUMBER TO PASS UP THE AND WE WILL HAVE TO PROTECT THE- ARE FRANKLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDE AS FAR AS THE- BY EVERYONE MESSED. INCLUDING ALL COMMITTEES. SB THIRTY FIVE ONE TWO INCLUDING THIS ONE INCLUDING MANY TRIBAL LOBBYIST WHO ARE. VERY CA TO BUILDING NO CAUGHT IT AND SO BETTER LATE THAN NEVER OWNED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO PASSING THAT LEGISLATION TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION SB. THIRTY FIVE I'M COMMITTED TO THAT WORK- IN TERMS OF THIS BILL THIS BILL AS I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING THIS BILL DOES NOT. APPROVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS. ALL RIGHT. SORRY IN SAID THIS BILL THOSE ARE AND SO THIS BILL DOES NOT STREAMLINE PARTICULAR ARE PROJECTS SOMEONE COULD A THIRTY. ON ANY PROJECT THAT TO THE CITY THAT QUALIFY AS FLOW THROUGH MINING- BUT THIS BILL IN AND OF ITSELF. DOES NOT. APPROVED PROJECTS EITHER VIA SEEK WHAT SB THIRTY FIVE OR ANY OTHER MECHANISM. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU FOR THAT HISTORY ON ON- HOW WE'VE GOTTEN TO TODAY HOWEVER WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY AND IT'S A VERY TRUE ISSUE THAT I BRING IT UP AS FAR AS TRYING TO FIX WHAT. WE WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN SB THIRTY FIVE AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS- BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING THAT- THAT ISSUE AGAIN BECAUSE IN THIS BILL- IT TALKS ABOUT DOES THIS BILL. DOES YOUR BILL NINE OH TWO DOESN'T EXAM SEQUEL. FIVE SIX IF ALL RIGHT WELL. THE DOES NOT EXEMPT SPECIFIC APPROVALS FROM SIX WORK THE SAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLUS WHAT FOR THE RE. THAT IS DONE ON P. IN THE CITY'S CODE I THAT DOES NOT APPROVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS EACH PROJECT WILL STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER APPROVAL PROCESS- WE'RE CURRENTLY EXIST OUR FOR THAT KIND OF PROJECT- AND THIS- DOES NOT CHANGE THAT THANK YOU YEAH. FOR THE MIDDLE AND IF I'M AND ONE OTHER THING I MENTIONED THE- THE BINDING OR THE WHEN YOU'RE DOING A PROJECT LIKE AN EXCAVATION FINDING REMAINS OR POTENTIAL ARTIFACTS- TO BE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WHEN YOU ARE DO BUILDING A PROJECT THIS IS THAT WHICH IS OF COURSE AFTER THE PROJECT'S GONNA PROVE WHETHER IT'S VIA STREAMLINE PROCESS SB THIRTY FIVE C. QUOTE IF YOU ARE EXCAVATING AND BUILDING- AND YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT MAYBE. REMAINS OR ARTIFACTS YOU HAVE TO STOP AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THAT PROJECT GOT APPROVED. THE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER LAW TO DO THAT WHETHER IT'S SB THIRTY FIVE OR SEQUEL AND THAT'S OF COURSE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TOPIC UP BECAUSE OF IF SPEAK WITHOUT EGGS THE IN YOUR FACE IN THAT PROCESS BUT HERE IN THE BILL AND PAGE TWO. THIS IS THE WAS. IN ADOPTED UNDER THESE PROVISIONS NOT A PROJECT FOR PURPOSES OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. SO I THINK THERE. I'M STILL NOT. WHETHER IT DOES OR DOESN'T SEE BUT I WOULD AND I THE DIAL THAT'S ON WITH AB ONE SIXTY A AND TRYING TO BRING TYPE OF RESOLVE TO THAT DISAGREEMENT THAT'S THERE- SO HOW. WOULD WE END UP GOING BACK TO THIS BILL NINE OH TWO ONCE THAT DISCUSSIONS DONE HOPEFULLY IT'S ONCE AND FOR ALL FAVORABLY TOWARDS THE TRIBAL- ASPECT TO IT. HOW DO WE THEN TAKE THAT AND PUT IT INTO THIS BILL IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY WAS A FIFTY TO BE CLEAR- AND UNDERLYING REFERRED TO YEAH I'M THAT YOU AYE. THAT IS CORRECT WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL. A ZONING THE KIND OF ZONING ORDINANCE THOUGHTS OF IT TO SEE WHAT. BUT AS OR DOES NOT APPROVE ANY PROJECTS AND- AND SO SB ONE OR AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT YEAH DOES NOT APPLY TO A REZONING IF IT PASSES WITH I. HOPE IT WILL AND I BELIEVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT REZONING A SPECIFIC PROJECT SO. THIS BILL DOES NOT APPROVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS WHICH IS ONE EITHER AB FIFTY TWO PROJECTS UP PROCESS WILL KICK IN OR IN AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT. OUR PROCESS ONCE I BILL- IT'S PAST INTO LAW. NOW FOR A SPECIFIC APPROVAL THIS IS ABOUT A REZONING THAT DOES NOT APPROVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS. SO IF ONE IF AB SO IF EIGHTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT PASSES ONCE THAT HAPPENS. THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES. TO AB ONE NOT MATTER TWO BECAUSE ONE SIXTY EIGHT WILL FLY. TO ANY SB THIRTY FIVE PROJECT. REGARDLESS OF. WHAT NINE OH TWO SAYS TO WOULD NOT INTERACT. THANK YOU. BURKE EGGNOG THAT THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING NOW CULTURAL RESOURCE IN IN REMAINS THAT ARE THERE THAT OMEHOW GOT THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT CA OF THE LAW BUT YOU'RE WILLING TO ADDRESS AND TO COME TO SEE TYPE OF FOR IT MY QUESTION IS STILL AS WHY WOULD WHY WOULD WE MOVE FORWARD- WHAT NINE OH TWO ONE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON FIXING THAT PART OF IT IN AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT AND THEN COULD BE. PART OF EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD AND WE HEARD SOME OTHER BILLS TODAY TO THAT DOUBT ALONG THIS AREA SO WELL THROUGH THE CHAIR SORRY FOR YEAH I MEAN I OFTENTIMES CHECK YOU'RE FINE THROUGH GOVERNMENT OBVIOUSLY AS WE GO AND THIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BILLS IN VARIOUS HOUSING BILLS UP IN BOTH HOUSES AND THE AND THE BODY RESPECT BODIES WILL.

AB NINE OH TWO THERE'S NOT APPROVED SPECIFIC PROJECTS WHICH IS ONE. EIGHT SB NINE TO THE APPROVED SERVER PROJECT. I THOUGHT THE PRICE APPROVAL. THAT EITHER A FIFTY TWO OR THE FUTURE AB ONE SIXTY. WHAT KICK AT. NOT BECAUSE OF OTHER. IT'S ABOUT THIS. PROJECT OF. AND THAT'S WHY IF IT ONE EIGHT WERE TO BE AN ACT INTO LAW WHICH I HOPE BE. THERE WOULD BE NO NEED-TO MAKE A- MODEL. OR CONFORM AND AB AND ASKING I KNOW TO. THANK YOU ANTI YOU CENTER I KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ON THIS IS AND THERE'S OTHER ISSUES ARE OUT THERE THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE COULD END UP. FINDING AN AREA RESOLVE- AROUND SB THIRTY FIVE AND THEN COMING TO SOME TERMS WITH THEM. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER.

YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE YEARS OF NEGLECT SO MANY YEARS OF NEGLECT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HEARING IN THIS ROOM HERE WITHIN THE HOUR. THE DEALS WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS STILL IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU STILL LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT NOW IT'S NOT TO HAND DEVELOPMENT.

CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE MOST MOST COUNTIES AND CITIES ARE CONTENDING WITH SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE ARENA REQUIREMENTS. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM THE FINANCIAL STRAINS OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS CREATED WHICH PLACES PRESSURE ON THEIR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS. I SUPPORT EFFORTS TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. WELL THIS BILL IS PERMISSIVE WHAT IT DOES ALLOWED LOCAL ELECTED BODIES TO DO REMAINS PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ALLOWING THE ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE WITHOUT SEQUEL REVIEW THAT COULD ALLOW HOUSING ON A SITE THAT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR RESIDENTIAL USE INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF REZONING COMMERCIAL SITES TO RESIDENTIAL USES. IT CONCERNS ME. SKIPPING WORK IN THE ZONING PROCESS WOULD SEE WHAT COULD ALSO BE BYPASS WITH THE EVENTUAL HOUSING PROJECT ON THE SAME PARCEL CONCERNS ME. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PROJECT LEVEL STREAMLINING HAS NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTIVE ALL SENSITIVE AND VALUABLE RESOURCES. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING THE ADOPTED THE AMENDMENT FOR ALLOWING INDUCTION OF THE ORDINANCE A COMPLEX WITH THE- WISHES THE VOTERS. ALSO ZONING I APPRECIATE THAT.

TWELVE YEARS AND ALMOST THREE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES LATER WE'VE LEARNED A LOT INCLUDING THAT WHILE WELL INTENDED SOME OF THE- PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROVISIONS NEED UPDATING AS THEY'RE OUT OF SYNC WITH BEST. PRACTICES FOR SEEKING PUBLIC INPUT ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC. LAST FALL WE BEGIN OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ON PLAN VERY TWENTY FIFTY WITH OVER THREE DOZEN IN PERSON POP UP OUTREACH EVENTS ACROSS ALL NINE COUNTIES. AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS SUCH AS FARMERS MARKETS LIBRARIES AND JOB FAIRS TRYING TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE EVENTS WERE LOCATED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN AND WE RECEIVED OVER THREE THOUSAND COMMENTS THAT INFORM THE NEXT STAGE OF THE PLANNING PROCESS. DESPITE THIS GREAT RESPONSE FROM THERE AND RESIDENTS MANY OF WHOM WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT ANYTHING ABOUT PLAN BAY AREA HAD WE NOT ATTENDED THESE EVENTS.

WE ARE ENHANCING ACCESS AND REACHING A WIDER AND MORE DIVERSE SET OF RESIDENTS THAN EVER. AND WHILE WE ALL EAGERLY AWAIT THE DAY WHEN WE IN PERSON MEETINGS CAN RESUME SAFELY. THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO VIRTUAL PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AS A MEANS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MORE STAKEHOLDERS THAN TYPICALLY ATTEND IN PERSON MEETINGS.
