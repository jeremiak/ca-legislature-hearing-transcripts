EMPIRE HERE IN SAMBOR MEDINA.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT IN EVERY CORNER OF THE

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE HOUSING

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CRISIS HAS LOOKED.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENTLY DOT IN DIFFERENT

BUT WHAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOOKS LIKE I KNOW BEARS SOME

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIMILARITY TO WHAT WE MAY BE

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

GOOD STEP.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE MIGHT SAY AS A DOWN PAYMENT

TIMES.

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AND THE CITIES HAVE VERY

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PARTICULAR THE STAFF AT THE

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LOWER STAFF LEVELS DON'T

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOES AND THE COUNTIES HELP A LOT

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS.

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PARTICULARLY I'M FOR THOSE WERE

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOW INCOME AND HOMELESS ON

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SERVICES.

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THE CONNECTIONS BUT A LOT OF

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:11.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOSE FOLKS LIVE IN THE CITIES

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND OR THEY MAY LIVE IN COUNTY

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON A CORPORATE IT BUT HOW DO WE

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:16.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
CONNECT THOSE RESOURCES
TOGETHER.

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BRICKS AND MORTARS IT'S ABOUT

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE ABILITY AND THE LONGEVITY OF

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT PERSON TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S CONNECTING THOSE UNEXPECTED

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTNERSHIPS. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE LEARNINGS AS WE'VE

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

REDEVELOPMENT TWO POINT NO BUT I

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:35.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

WHERE WE KIND TRYING TO GO WHAT

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WERE

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

REGULATIONS HOW DO WE SPEND IT

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT SHOULD BE WHAT YOU DO? BUT

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW DO WE GET TO THE OBJECTIVE

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:06.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE FOR TRYING

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE IS IT

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
JUST SPENDING FUNDS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS. AND

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO IT REALLY GOT INTO THE

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:16.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%

SAID WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:10.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHALLENGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:14.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE DID. WAS A FIVE ACRE OFFSITE

THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

GOT SITE CONTROL UNTIL THAT TIME

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:27.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE PARCEL WAS FULLY ENTITLED

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

NINETY DAYS.

00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:34.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT CAN BE DONE IN THE SERIOUS

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVER YOU KNOW STOOD UP AND MADE

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:37.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT HAPPEN IT'S ANY CITIES THAT

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAY THEY CAN'T GET IT DONE IS

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST NOT TRUE NINETY DAYS FROM

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTROL TOLL FULL ENTITLEMENT

INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL EIGHTEEN

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MONTHS UNTIL WE WERE FULLY

OCCUPIED CONSTRUCTION COMPLETED.

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:49.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE MOVED AYE WE HAVE NOW MOVED

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:50.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON SITE WITH THE FIRST PHASE ON

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:52.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SITE. IN A COUPLE OF THE

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRINCIPLES THAT WERE FOLLOWING

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:55.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THROUGH IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:56.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS PROJECT IS NOT JUST TO

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REPLACE THE HOUSING UNITS IS TO

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADD SOME ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HOUSING UNITS BUT MORE

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANTLY TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NEIGHBORHOOD IS A PROJECT.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO A COUPLE OF THE CONCEPTS

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:06.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONCE AGAIN I JUST SKIPPING

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THROUGH MOST OF THE SLIDES

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE WERE ABLE TO DO AS PART OF

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS NUMBER ONE WE DID A SPECIFIC

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:18.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE THE CITY IS HAMMERED

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNIT NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:21.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DO IT AND OUR COMMITMENT FROM

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE VERY BEGINNING WAS NOT JUST

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
READ DEVELOPING THE SITE AND

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REPLACING THE HOUSING. BUT

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:27.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSFORMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:28.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SAMAEL COUNTY HAS BEEN

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DESIGNATED THE LEAST HEALTHY

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:31.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAJOR METROPOLITAN COUNTY IN THE

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NATION. THE INTERSECTION OF

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:35.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASELINE A WATERMAN IS THE LEAST

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HEALTHY INTERSECTION IN THE

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNTY SO WE'RE REDEVELOPING THE

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEAST HEALTHY INTERSECTION IN

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE ENTIRE NATION.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THAT'S BASED ON RATIOS OF

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FAST FOOD VAPE STORES LIQUOR

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STORES MARIJUANA IT'S CENTERED

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CENTER AND POVERTY RATES AND

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES INTO

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:50.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THAT CALCULATION.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO THIS PROJECT IN THE FUNDS

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT HAVE COME TO THIS PROJECT

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE NOT JUST GOING TO CREATE

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:57.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUALITY HOUSING GREGORY ABLE TO

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
REVITALIZE THE ENTIRE

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:02.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST REAL QUICK AS WITH ALL OF

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:02.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR PROJECTS AND BY THE WAY I'M

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:03.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT PRESIDENCY OF NATIONAL

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE RENAISSANCE WHERE THE

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LARGEST NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:09.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOUSING DEVELOPER IN SOUTHERN

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA. IT NINE THOUSAND

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:10.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNITS WERE ALSO IN TEXAS AND

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ARKANSAS.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WHERE A TYPICAL NONPROFIT

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO WE USE EVERY TOOL THAT'S

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AVAILABLE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONSTRUCTION WAS SIX PROJECTS

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:24.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE HAPPEN TO BE VERY BUSY BUT

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERY

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROJECT IS GETTING TOUGHER

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:28.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOTCHES FROM A FINANCING

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STANDPOINT BUT FROM A POLITICAL

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STANDPOINT. BUT AT LEAST THE

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:36.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MARGINS ARE GETTING THINNER.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I HAVE A MAYES LISTENING TO ME

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:40.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THAT WAS ATTACHED.

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT FOUR POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:42.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
LEAVE YOU WITH?

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN ORDER FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO DO AS AN INDUSTRY AROUND

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS NOT JUST

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BE SITE SPECIFIC IN OUR

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ORIENTATION

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW WELL

01:01:58.481 --> 01:01:59.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE DO CAN BE CATALYTIC IN THE

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:00.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
REDEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO THE MORE WE

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK ABOUT HOUSING AS A PART OF

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN A CATTLE LAST FOR A CATALYST

01:02:06.722 --> 01:02:08.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SECOND IS WE CAN'T JUST

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FORGOTTEN FOCUS ON HOUSING AS A

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN ISOLATION WE REALLY NEED TO

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK ABOUT HOUSING AS PART OF

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SYSTEM. AND THE MOST EASY TO

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXACT TO TALK ABOUT IT WHAT I

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TESTIFIED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:22.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HEALTH

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND HOUSING. AND HOW WOULD A

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CRITICAL SOCIAL DETERMINATE OF

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH HOUSING IS AS SILLY WHEN

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE'VE BEEN

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORKING FOR THE LAST WEEK I'VE

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN WORKING WITH AYE AGE PEOPLE

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LAST FORTIFIED YEARS. I'M

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GETTING HIGH E. H. P. TO LOOK AT

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOUSING AND YOU'LL BE HEARING

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FROM THEM LATER TODAY. BUT

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:40.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACROSS THE STATE OF WE THINK

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT THE UTILIZATION OF HEALTH

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DOLLARS THE RETURN ON THAT

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:46.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INVESTMENT IS MASSIVE. IF WE

HAVE ADEQUATE HOUSING FOR THE

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE COUNTY

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOS ANGELES PUBLIC HEALTH

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:52.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEPARTMENT CREATED THERE ARE

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOUSING AUTHORITY. THEY ARE WHAT

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY ARE EXPERIENCING A NET

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POSITIVE CASH FLOW THIRTY FOUR

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSE

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:01.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERSON THE COST OF PROVIDING

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:03.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SERVICES TO A HOMELESS PERSON.

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:05.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VERSUS THE COST OF PROVIDING

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOUSING OF SERVICES TO SUNDAY'S

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:07.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ADEQUATELY HOUSE.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:07.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOUSING AS

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PART OF A SYSTEM NOT AS A STAND

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALONE IN EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:12.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT THE STATE TAKES INTO

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:15.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE THOUGHT

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:16.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ABOUT HOUSING SO PROP FORTY

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEVEN FOR EXAMPLE. EVERY SINGLE

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:21.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PERSON BEING RELEASED OR

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:24.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RELOCATED WHAT'S THE HOUSING

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOLUTION FOR THAT PERSON IS TO

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BE A PART OF THE EQUATION

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHERWISE OUR EXPECTATIONS WELL.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'M.

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:28.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROBABLY NOT BE REALIZED

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE OF THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DON'T DEAL WITH DAY WE NEED

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO DO AT EVERY LEVEL OF

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNMENT. IS IT'S EASY TO

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNT THE COST OF FEES IT'S EASY

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:37.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO COUNT THE HARD COSTS BUT WE

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:40.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALSO NEED TO COUNT THE COST OF

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TIME THE COSTA PROCESS.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACOSTA MEDICATIONS THE COST OF

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
LITIGATION THE COST OF

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMPLIANCE IS ALL OF THOSE SOFT

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COSTS ARE ESTIMATES AND ANYWHERE

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:51.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOLLARS PER UNIT IN THE COST OF

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
PRODUCING UNITS.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF WE KNOW THAT UP FRONT THEN WE

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:56.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OKAY WHAT IS THIS OBLIGATION

01:03:58.534 --> 01:03:59.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE'RE REQUIRING GOING TO

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
COST THE PROJECT.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND WE CAN GET INTO THAT IN

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHATEVER LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WANT. AND THEN THE LAST POINT

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:07.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'D MAKE IS WE REALLY NEED TO

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOCUS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE HOW'D

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE PRODUCE MORE HOUSINGMANY OF

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUR PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSING ON THE

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DEMAND SIDE. AND EVERYTIME WE

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FURTHER FIND THE DEMAND SIDE WE

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:17.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FURTHER INCREASE THE COST OF

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOUSING AND THAT SHORTAGE OF

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ON THE DEMAND SIDE AND.

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GET INTO THAT HAVE WHATEVER

PUCK APOSTATE HOUSES WE HAVE

BEEN HERE ARE PROVIDED FROM

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:45.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%

ACCOUNT.

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:48.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CHALLENGE IN THE AREA.

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS SEX TRAFFICKING THE SEXUAL

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:55.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE WHERE THE CROSSROADS SO

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EITHER THEY'RE COMING DOWN NORTH

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OR SOUTH THEY'RE COMING FROM THE

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EAST TO THE WEST FOR COMING OUT

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:02.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF LA AND SO THIS IS AS WE ARE

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:04.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE SHIPPING AND AND A

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:05.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANUFACTURING HUB. ROUTES OF THE

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HUB THE TRAFFICKING OF MOSTLY

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOMEN. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
TO THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT
IS.

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT I THINK APPROPRIATELY THE

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:15.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
G. DE CRIMINALIZATION OF THAT

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:18.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDER AGE SEX TRAFFICKERS.

01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:19.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOWEVER WHAT THEY DID WAS IT

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOOK AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY OF LAW

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENFORCEMENT TO MOVE THEM INTO A

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAFE ENVIRONMENT. AND SO NOW

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:30.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
RELEASED WITHOUT ANY PLACE TO
GO.

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:31.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SO THERE'S A GAP IN THEIR

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:36.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:39.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFIES UNDER AGE

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WOMEN IN THE SEX TRAFFIC

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUSINESS WHEN THEY CAN'T

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTERVENE AND THEY HAVE NO PLACE

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:47.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR THEM TO GO? AND SO WE ARE

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:29.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AMOUNT HISTORICALLY YOU PROBABLY

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:31.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
KNOW THAT.

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:32.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE USE TO BE A TIME WHERE.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IT WAS JUST.

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:37.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PURELY YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:38.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS GETTING WORSE THE NUMBERS ARE

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GETTING MORE GIVE US MORE MONEY

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:40.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GIVE US MORE MONEY GIVE US MORE

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:42.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MONEY AS WE GOT MORE PERFORMANCE

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:43.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSCIOUS AND MORE PERFORMANCE

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BASED.

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:47.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NO THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT THEIR

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:50.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT FUNDING BEING TIED TO.

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:53.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERFORMANCE AND THUS A DECREASE

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEN NUMBER SO I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:57.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THE

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOMELESS COUNT THAT IS BEING

01:40:59.019 --> 01:40:59.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
USED PERHAPS.

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE CAN DO SOMETHING MORE WITH

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:02.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THE JUST LOOK AT A ONE A

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:04.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NUMBER FOR A. THE MOST CURRENT

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:06.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YEAR AND PERHAPS EVEN DO A

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
COMPARISON.

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:11.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:13.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH THAT I WON A NOTE WITH MY

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:15.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SON A SECOND SUGGESTION.

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:17.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN MATTERS THAT READ A POINT NOW

01:41:17.304 --> 01:41:19.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHERE WE'RE NO LONGER USING

01:41:19.072 --> 01:41:20.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

SOURCES OF DATA ARE.

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:45.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE HOMELESS COUNT.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:52.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE POINT TIME COUNTY THE

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:55.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANCE OF THAT THAT IN THE

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND THE USE OF IT.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:59.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUT. IN THAT'S BEING MORE

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:01.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
EMBEDDED INTO.

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

HMIS IS NOT.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:09.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S RARELY LOOKED AT IN TERMS

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:11.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF ABOUT AT LEAST WHAT I READ

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:13.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THROUGH THE VARIOUS BILLS IS

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:14.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT'S RARELY MENTION.

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:16.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
AND YET.

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:19.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT'S A MORE COMPREHENSIVE.

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:21.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IN A MORE ROBUST

THE AND A SYSTEM.

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:26.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEN THE POINT CONCURRENT.

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:28.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND HERE IN THE COUNTY.

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:29.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:16.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS TIME IT IS GOING TO WORK

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:18.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED.

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:08.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY FROM MY

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:11.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE HAS

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:12.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SEAMLESSLY WITH LOCALS BUT THAT

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

THERE WAS AN INITIAL FEAR.

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BECAUSE

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:38.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOMELESSNESS KNOWS IT WAS HIS

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:40.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FEAR OF THIS LEARNING CURVE.

LITTLE WHILE? BUT LIKE HERE IN

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE COUNTY IS A VERY GOOD

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:50.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALL THESE

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:52.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
DIFFERENT FOLKS.

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:53.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT PERHAPS MOST OF THEM RUN

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
LEARNING CURVE.

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:57.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEY GOT WITH THE PROGRAM.

01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY VERY ARTICULATE ABOUT THE

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
ISSUES.

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY MUCH UNDERSTANDING SO THAT

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
INITIAL FEAR.

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:06.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS NOT TRUE SO TO WHATEVER

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:07.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DEGREE.

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU CAN BET SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:48:09.549 --> 01:48:10.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
INTO LEGISLATION.

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

INITIAL FINDINGS IN THE

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:16.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEGINNING OF SOMETHING IS JUST

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:17.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD GO A

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:18.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
LONG WAY.

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
IT WOULD GIVE.

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW COUNTIES BY COUNTIES I

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

BE PART OF.

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO WHATEVER

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO. IN THIS EQUATION IF OUR

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:52.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOAL IS TO IMPACT THE HEALTH OF

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:53.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR MEMBERS AND HOPEFULLY BY

01:56:53.906 --> 01:56:54.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXTENSION THE HEALTH OF FAMILIES

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND COMMUNITIES. AROUND THEM WE

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEED TO BE BROADER WE NEED TO BE

01:56:58.878 --> 01:57:00.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MORE HOLISTIC WE CAN'T FOCUS

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:01.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONLY ON THE HEALTH CARE THAT

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE THAT'S BEING DELIVERED.

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:06.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WE CALL THIS APPROACH OF

01:57:06.419 --> 01:57:06.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:57:07.053 --> 01:57:08.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OF HEALTH. AND.

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE AT AYE HP HAVE TAKEN AND.

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:13.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
A PRETTY ACTIVE.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:17.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ROLE IN TRYING TO STRATEGICALLY.

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK ABOUT AN INVEST WHERE WE

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:20.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CAN GET.

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:25.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MOST IMPACT IN TERMS OF OF

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:25.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:26.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOUSING IS COME UP AS NUMBER ONE

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:26.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IN TERMS OF.

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:27.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AWARE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:29.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
STRONGEST IMPACT.

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:31.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:32.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DATA OUT IN THE LITERATURE THAT

01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:34.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I CAN SAY TODAY ABOUT WHY THAT'S

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CASE. I THINK MOST OF US

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:38.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROBABLY.

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:40.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RECOGNIZE IF WHERE IN THIS

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:41.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORLD WHAT THAT CONNECTION LOOKS

01:57:41.854 --> 01:57:45.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE ALL GIVEN EXAMPLE A MEMBER

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MISTER PER AS WHICH IS NOT HIS

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:48.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REAL NAME BECAUSE WE CHANGED IT.

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:51.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHO HAS CHRONIC DIABETES?

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:52.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
HAS.

01:57:52.632 --> 01:57:55.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PAIN IN HIS LIMBS BECAUSE ABOUT

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:56.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIABETES IN THE POOR CONTROL

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIABETES HAS ULCERS ON HIS LEGS.

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:01.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF A

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:04.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
HOSPITAL.

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:04.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
HE'S PROBABLY.

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAYBE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:07.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:09.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING

01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:10.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR HIM.

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:12.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HIS PHYSICIANS ARE ALL

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRUSTRATED THAT HE'S NOT TAKING

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:16.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HIS INSULIN AND ON HIS TEST

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:17.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRIPS AND IF YOU JUST DIG A

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LITTLE BIT FURTHER YOU WOULD

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:21.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEARN THAT HE. RECENTLY LOST HIS

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:22.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOUSING WHERE HE WAS STAYING

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITH HIS AUNT AND THAT HE

01:58:23.963 --> 01:58:24.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
DOESN'T HAVE.

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:26.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HE DOESN'T HAVE A STABLE SOURCE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:27.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF HOUSING HE'S ACTUALLY AND

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SHELTERED THAT HIS DAILY

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:32.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTIVITY IS OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:33.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE AM I GOING TO SEE TONIGHT

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:35.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW AM I GONNA STAY SAFE WHERE'S

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MY NEXT MEAL COMING FROM. AND

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:38.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHETHER OR NOT HE'S YOU KNOW

01:58:38.845 --> 01:58:40.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABLE TO MONITOR HIS BLOOD SUGAR

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS VERY LOW ON THE LEFT AND SO I

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK IT HEALTH CARE WE

01:58:43.082 --> 01:58:44.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETIMES REFERRED ABOUT WE MAKE

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:45.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
JUDGMENTS.

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:46.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK LISA TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:47.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A LITTLE THAT WE'VE REFER TO

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:49.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS AS NON COMPLIANCE. THAT'S

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY NOT THE CASE AT THE VERY

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:52.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RATIONAL DECISION THAT HE'S

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:53.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKING IN HIS CURRENT CONTACTS

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:55.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE NEED TO OF THE HEALTH

01:58:55.394 --> 01:58:58.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM RECOGNIZE THAT AND FIGURE

01:58:58.898 --> 01:58:59.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OUT HOW WE BUILD AROUND IT.

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:00.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DON'T GO FOR YOU YEAH YOU

01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:01.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MENTIONED THE LITERATURE THAT.

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:03.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:04.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHERE THE LITERATURE BUT.

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:05.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
I'D LOVE TO

GET IT.

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:10.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL SENATORS THIS WOULD HAVE A

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:12.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MUCH YOUNGER SLIDE DECK I

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:13.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSIDER HAD ALTERED REFERENCE

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:13.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ERA.

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:14.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
I THINK THOSE OF US WHO

BY EACH P. MEMBERS ARE THERE NOT

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:07.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
NECESSARILY.

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:07.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
GREAT.

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:08.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:09.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROGRAMS VOUCHERS FUNDING

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:11.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE COULD WE

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PLAY AGAIN AND ALSO ECONOMICALLY

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:15.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT

02:00:15.274 --> 02:00:16.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIRST ROUND WHERE'S THAT MAKES

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:18.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT SO WE IDENTIFIED TWO GROUPS

02:00:18.377 --> 02:00:20.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE ARE. WORKING WITH A ONE

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:22.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS THOSE MEMBERS AND LONG TERM

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CARE AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:25.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SITUATION.

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:27.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:28.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
PERSONALLY.

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:30.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND AT AYE HP WE'VE ABOUT

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:33.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS WHO

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:35.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE IN LONG TERM CARE AND WE

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:36.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:38.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERCENT OF THEM. ACTUALLY DON'T

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:39.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NEED TO BE THERE FOR THE

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PURPOSES OF THE FACILITY IN FOR

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NURSING CARE.

02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:44.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THOSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANYWHERE TO GO AND THAT IS THE

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PREDOMINANT REASON THAT THEY'RE

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:48.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THERE AND SO.

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:50.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE LOOKED AT WE ARE WE ARE

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:52.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLY ENDED THINK OUR FIRST

SAN BERNIE DO YOU KNOW.

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:45.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I AM CHOOSING THE THE MEMBERS

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:49.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH WE

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:51.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS.

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:53.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
INTO OBVIOUSLY HOW MIGHT

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WE ALSO

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:56.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOOKED AT PUBS WERE PUBLIC

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:57.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGENCY WERE USING PUBLIC DOLLARS

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:59.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WE WENT UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:00.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF SAVINGS AND ECONOMIC PIECE

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:02.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD WEIGH AND. AND SO FOR OUR

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:03.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LONG TERM CARE GROUP

02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:05.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:06.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOSE FOLKS ARE ESSENTIALLY

02:03:06.779 --> 02:03:07.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RECEIVING HOUSING BECAUSE

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO BE

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:10.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANYWHERE ELSE AND WE'RE PAYING

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:11.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:12.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AVERAGE FOR THEM.

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:15.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WE KNOW WE COULD SUPPORT

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:17.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR HOUSING PLUS ALL OF THEIR

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:18.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INCOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:20.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER NEEDS LIKELY FOR AROUND

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:21.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
HALF THAT COST.

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:23.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY THE

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:24.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:25.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

HEALTH FOR THAT GROUP.

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:29.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I THINK IT ALSO ARGUES THAT

02:03:29.368 --> 02:03:31.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS A GOOD USE OF OF DOLLARS

02:03:31.337 --> 02:03:32.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OVERALL.

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE SECOND POPULATION IN THIS

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:36.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS WHERE A LOT OF THE LITERATURE
