WEBVTT

0
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.470
right

1
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:58.870
we're gonna start momentarily

2
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.860
we're just waiting for two

3
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.820
more members so we can begin

4
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.000
with a quorum and then

5
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.590
we can move forward from that

6
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.050
point so when for two members

7
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.180
-- things

8
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.880
this is the other person

9
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.470
Mayes hi I'm texting

10
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.790
chat right now okay

11
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.370
Cristina Garcia

12
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:44.780
Gloria

13
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:29.630
of

14
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.070
you want to start will

15
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.010
well like we have it would

16
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.340
have to bring we'll probably

17
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.350
have to just to the rules

18
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.380
there was another yeah yeah

19
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.410
if we can guess whenever

20
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.140
yeah yeah

21
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.860
afternoon I we're going to

22
00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.260
begin with -- our utility

23
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.820
energy committee -- hearing

24
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.970
-- this is -- dealing with a

25
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.810
variety of topics but basically

26
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.350
focusing on the the evolution

27
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.730
in metamorphosis is taking

28
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.000
place in the energy sector while

29
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.620
maintaining reliability -- and

30
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.210
affordability on the road to

31
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.480
the carbonization -- it was

32
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.430
my hope that we would have a

33
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.810
quorum at the beginning so we

34
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.990
can improve our -- our rules for

35
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.370
this -- this committee about

36
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.520
will probably gonna have to do

37
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.460
that in another time because

38
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.770
I know we also have members

39
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.810
who are here who will have to

40
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:44.980
appear in other committees and

41
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.990
so -- we're going to begin with

42
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.820
this hearing a give them the

43
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.780
opportunity to participate at

44
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.800
various times along the way --

45
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.470
that will allow them to -- to

46
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.100
drop back and so -- in respect

47
00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.590
for their time we're going to

48
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.260
begin let me just say again

49
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.920
thank you for for being here

50
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.750
this is -- informational

51
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.800
hearing will examine as I said

52
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.380
before the metamorphosis of the

53
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.630
energy sector of foundational

54
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.950
to successfully achieving

55
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.010
our environmental mandates

56
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.770
is keeping energy affordable

57
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.030
and reliable we know from

58
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.400
the energy crisis that those

59
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.880
critical foundations were

60
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.290
compromised in response to the

61
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.690
energy crisis the legislature

62
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.040
mandated the California

63
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.490
public utilities commission to

64
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:30.110
establish a regulatory program

65
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.290
a paradigm which mandates that

66
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.120
entities under the C. P. UC's

67
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.400
jurisdiction which mandates

68
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.540
that entities under their

69
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.280
jurisdiction maintain sufficient

70
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.550
power resources to reliably

71
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.990
Sir the man that regulatory

72
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.940
paradigm is fundamental to the

73
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.000
well being of the energy sector

74
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.660
this hearing will discuss the

75
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.480
recent improvements to the

76
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.670
resource adequacy explore the

77
00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.610
deficiencies in other areas of

78
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.010
concern this hearing is being

79
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.570
held prior to legislation being

80
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.830
heard him this committee so that

81
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.920
led just say there's can better

82
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.830
understand the immediate and

83
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.490
growing needs of the electric

84
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.470
system at all levels of the

85
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.640
system there are a growing

86
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.110
number of entities assuming the

87
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.190
responsibility to procure energy

88
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.650
to serve the dim energy demand

89
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.620
of their communities each one

90
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.460
of those entities is playing

91
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.440
a vital role in maintaining

92
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.880
the well being of the

93
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.940
complex energy infrastructure

94
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.900
much like a car engine each

95
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.750
component is vital to the car's

96
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.560
performance I'm convinced that

97
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.660
by working together we can

98
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.350
address the challenges before us

99
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.790
and to continue to demonstrate

100
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:41.940
to the world the California is

101
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.910
a showcase for how to reliably

102
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.380
and affordably the carbonized

103
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.440
our energy infrastructure we

104
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.980
have two panels that will be

105
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.410
presenting to us today and give

106
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.150
us an opportunity to hear their

107
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.650
presentation and the question

108
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.530
each of these individuals so

109
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.980
let me call if I could the

110
00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.250
first panel forward to join us

111
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.350
-- they will be providing an

112
00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:03.760
overview on the changing needs

113
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.760
of the energy system of would

114
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.100
like to call for Michael picker

115
00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.470

system operator to have a quorum

126
00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:31.860
one more

127
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.310
and --

128
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.330
morning I Michael Victor

129
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.750
this big run about now

130
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.630
hi better okay great

131
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.720
slow hard to tell from here

132
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.980
I'm a kick off and talk a little

133
00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.750
bit about our examination of

134
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.080
on the changes that we're seeing

135
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.320
in the electric industry in

136
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.500
California how their reflects

137
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.800
on our ability meet our clean

138
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.780
energy goals reliability

139
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.230
-- and some of the other key

140
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.850
elements of what it is that we

141
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.040
need to do I'll just start out

142
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.650
by saying that three years ago

143
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.250
I used to go to to the

144
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.910
legislative hearings like this

145
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.310
conferences the small meetings

146
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:20.550
where we are talking about the

147
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.080
death spiral of the electric

148
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.530
utilities due to the net

149
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.200
energy -- meter group of

150
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.900
fine roof top solar

151
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.150
and so currently the utilities

152
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.330
are still here although there

153
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.730
are a lot of stress but two

154
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.240
of the largest to than that

155
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.540
companies who actually -- sold

156
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.010
into the net energy metered

157
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.970
market are gone south solar

158
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.940
city and son Addison so what

159
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.070
I'm gonna try to do is spend

160
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.580
about ten minutes just odd

161
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.060
brawling broad perspectives and

162
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.890
trends as opposed to focusing

163
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.870
on any one particular element

164
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.680
that it was important to

165
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.030
remind ourselves that utilities

166
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.840
electric utilities have not

167
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.140
-- new generation since about

168
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.980
nineteen ninety eight at

169
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.270
legislative direction as a

170
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.920
picker if I could -- we've got

171
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.380
a quorum now so we're going to

172
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.570
of visually open the

173
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.660

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.870
he is I San Diego teen

198
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.960
okay they are a rules just

199
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.320
ended up to thank you members

200
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.010
present picker please continue

201
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.930
Sir I was just say this is just

202
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.360
commenting that the that the

203
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.770
legislature actually for a bed

204
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.680
the electric utilities to own

205
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.790
new electric generation after

206
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.190
about nineteen ninety eight --

207
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.990
they do that through contracting

208
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.690
into kind of a complicated

209
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.270
bilateral market the drives

210
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.600
the price down and gets the

211
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.290
best project based on least

212
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.110
cost best fit for the needs

213
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.180
-- but we're moving into a

214
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.050
different universe these days

215
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.510
in a variety of other ways and

216
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.980
so the changes taking place

217
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.040
on two axes one is technology

218
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.890
and the other is business models

219
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.570
and so there's opportunity

220
00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.450
for customers to make choices

221
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.860
based on business models as

222
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.090
well as making choices about

223
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.670
technologies they will use

224
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.160
on their own out that most

225
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.470
of the discussion really takes

226
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.230
place on the generation side

227
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.570
because it's full of all kinds

228
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.310
of cool things like battery

229
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.000
storage and and rooftop solar

230
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.510
but in reality the most

231
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.250
important choice and the most

232
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.320
important opportunity for

233
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.730
customers to take control

234
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.160
has been in terms of energy

235
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.610
efficiency and other demand side

236
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.740
opportunities and I'll get back

237
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.720
to that in just a second but the

238
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.130
other pieces that energy itself

239
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.860
has just become a commodity

240
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.140
and and the services that

241
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.990
people used to be able to manage

242
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.350
their use of electricity is

243
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.220
becoming increasingly valuable

244
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.920
so let's to examine some of

245
00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.170
the technologies that are

246
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.860
actually taking more and more

247
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.120
place in the marketplace energy

248
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.230
efficiency again it's reducing

249
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.440
demand for electricity through

250
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.500
building an appliance standards

251
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.000
probably the most significant

252
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.080
source -- changing the building

253
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.730
envelope through insulation

254
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:16.990
we're starting to see new

255
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.800
technologies come into play

256
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.070
that actually swap one fuel for

257
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.530
another -- grandma geothermal

258
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.650
for heating and cooling and

259
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.890
homes is new homes it's as

260
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.950
cheap as hot water heaters and

261
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.440
gas furnaces and it is cleaner

262
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.490
-- combined heat and power in

263
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.200
the industrial and and a large

264
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.680
commercial sector very important

265
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.420
to actually meeting our energy

266
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.750
needs early and -- the seventies

267
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.710
eighties and and continues to

268
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.810
be an important part this came

269
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.580
about as a result of federal

270
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.150
program called purpose -- I

271
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.620
won't go into the act in them

272
00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.580
but it actually required that

273
00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.830
if you could get a a license

274
00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.320
to operate one of these cho

275
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.890
Chen facilities and the utility

276
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.700
had to take the contract it

277
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.060
was very very very -- affected

278
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.550
-- self generation I'm in a

279
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.320
point to the fact that Amazon

280
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.920
and Google for example --

281
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.220
at Hey I can actually buy their

282
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.590
own Nguyen plants they can buy

283
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.040
their own solar plants sometimes

284
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.550
in the desert sometimes even

285
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.660
out of state they pay a price

286
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.620
to send their electrons over

287
00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.500
the wires to their facilities

288
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.990
and all over the state of

289
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.140
California that's about three

290
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.580
gigawatts of electricity it

291
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.030
shows up in most of our

292
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.430
over view of electricity use

293
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.440
as actually being a reduction

294
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.670
because it's new goes away

295
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.560
from those regulated utilities

296
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.300
rooftop solar that's about five

297
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.500
to maybe six gigawatts of

298
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.490
power again it looks a little

299
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.280
bit like energy efficiency

300
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:56.900
this is could be considered to

301
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.470
be a business model since most

302
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.560
of that was built through a

303
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.590
financial engineering product

304
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.840
than an energy metering --

305
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.670
though it's fairly complicated

306
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.380
but it involves getting a lot

307
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.350
of people to sign up for lease

308
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.280
-- that they the owner of

309
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.210
the solar panels is actually

310
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.880
the companies like sun at its

311
00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.320
centre solar city or son run

312
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.720
they then sell those leases

313
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.670
into the secondary market so I

314
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.170
mean you have to find customers

315
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.690
have high fight go scores of

316
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.190
the fuel cell batteries this

317
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.110
is sort of a it's a choice of

318
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.420
people who want to pay more but

319
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.260
-- act asking for additional

320
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.990
reliability so it's really

321
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.740
applicables and not people

322
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.060
who have online sales -- crate

323
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.780
and barrel for example if you

324
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.950
miss the the Easter process

325
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.440
you sales market if you miss

326
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.130
the Christmas mark sell it at

327
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.610
seventy percent your sales cross

328
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.610
year she'll pay extra to make

329
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.860
sure that your servers have

330
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.860
electricity on those on those

331
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.810
weeks -- business models

332
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.890
sec so just to to mention

333
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.950
as of September two thousand

334
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.220
eighteen rather than having

335
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.760
three electricity providers we

336
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.760
have thirty seven what we call

337
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.810
load serving entities under

338
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.550
P. R. C. jurisdiction that

339
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:11.860
doesn't include the publicly

340
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.980
owned utilities -- that's

341
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.380
three I -- use nineteen CC

342
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.470
ace and fourteen electric city

343
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.490
service service providers their

344
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.780
important and I'll come back

345
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.570
to them in a second there's

346
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.630
additional business model called

347
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.370
pace property assessed clean

348
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.250
energy loans that is used

349
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.210
for people who who want to buy

350
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.130
a rooftop solar array in on it

351
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.600
or sometimes it's used as a

352
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.530
way to help finance those nam

353
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.500
projects and and

354
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.700
did spews for energy efficiency

355
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.860
it's usually sold door to door

356
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.990
or in other kind of high volume

357
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.790
sales tactics -- the recently

358
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.430
the consumer product

359
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.940
-- -- protection board

360
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.590
and have established by -- Dodd

361
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.300
Frank after the the collapse

362
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.460
of the housing market due

363
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.590
to toxic loans decided they

364
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.000
needed to step in because a

365
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.610
predatory marketing of these

366
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.180
prayer pace loans to people who

367
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.830
actually couldn't afford them

368
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.890
and couldn't pay them based

369
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.500
on the energy that they saved

370
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.500
direct access that's rob was

371
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.410
was the original -- deregulated

372
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.910
market of two thousand two

373
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.990
thousand one when -- we we had

374
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.000
a number of failures there and

375
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.340
day a lot of predatory tactics

376
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.230
by people were supplying some

377
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.540
of these electricity service

378
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.910
providers the legislature chose

379
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.780
to re regulate and made several

380
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.130
important reforms but there are

381
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.660
a number of people who continue

382
00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.020
to serve that market the

383
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.300
legislature cap that it fourteen

384
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.470
percent of all the customer

385
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.020
usable actress city in the state

386
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.040
of California it's mostly in

387
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.510
the commercial and industrial

388
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.620
sector -- still very important

389
00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.130
to the -- is one of the things

390
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.550
he keeps prices competitive

391
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.110
for for manufacturing in

392
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.600
other high energy intensive

393
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.050
-- -- businesses --

394
00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.070
but it light they like it to

395
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.540
grow senator Hertzberg carried a

396
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.360
bill that would have lifted the

397
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.650
cap completely he agreed to

398
00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:17.270
allow a more orderly progression

399
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.320
and -- it's now it's seventeen

400
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.320
percent and and

401
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.160
then -- he's asked us to come

402
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.750
back with the planned for two

403
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.530
in twenty twenty to lift the cap

404
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.360
completely so there's

405
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.190
a traditional utilities like

406
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.570
the investor owned utilities

407
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.230
and the publicly owned utilities

408
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.380
the irrigation districts and and

409
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.870
-- and if you co ops these

410
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.370
are a we used to be vertically

411
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.650
integrated which meant that

412
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.750
they own the generation the

413
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.820
Senate to the customers over

414
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.460
the wires and transmission the

415
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.930
day on and then they -- they

416
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.810
had a service area that they

417
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.360
completely controlled nobody

418
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.780
else was allowed to compete with

419
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.810
them there as you can see that's

420
00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.760
change more recently we've

421
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.520
seen the growth of the clean

422
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.070
-- they keep me the the the --

423
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.330
the community aggregators --

424
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.450
their authorized in two thousand

425
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.990
three Marin clean energy

426
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.440
actually started up in two

427
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.600
thousand one there now flashing

428
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.200
-- two people pay a lot of

429
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.000
attention to them but as you

430
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.910
can see there's a wide range of

431
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.380
different -- business models and

432
00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.110
technology that are all starting

433
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.710
to move into a competition

434
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.490
with our traditional providers

435
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:31.410
so here's a kind of where we

436
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.140
get into our uncharted and

437
00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.120
potentially dangerous territory

438
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:37.780
where neither here nor there

439
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.220
we stepped away from that

440
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.360
model that the legislature

441
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.820
sent us back to after two

442
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.770
thousand and one but slowly

443
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.400
over time market share has

444
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.870
moved away and we have a lot

445
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.300
of different providers who are

446
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.120
regulated in different ways

447
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.510
if you know the act the cleanest

448
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.030
way would be if we had

449
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.080
vertically integrated utilities

450
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.770
or we went to fall competition

451
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:05.370
where everybody picked erect

452
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.220
lecture city provider and then

453
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.550
you had discrete transmission

454
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.350
and the street distribution

455
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.730
companies that's what Texas in

456
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.010
New York do it works for

457
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.290
them not clear if it work

458
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:19.680
for here but it's also clear

459
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.920
we're not going to go back to

460
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.050
a vertically integrated system

461
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.430
so the question is what do you

462
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.790
do and I just got tired a bit

463
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.520
about out some of the challenges

464
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.810
that we're seeing so reaching

465
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.950
our clean energy goals the the

466
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.680
clip of the CCA's two gigawatts

467
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.300
of growth from two thousand to

468
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.240
the gate -- to to eight

469
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.680
today during that same period

470
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.110
the investor owned utilities

471
00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.110
-- actually contracted and

472
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.520
built -- something like twenty

473
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.990
gigawatts of power so there's

474
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.910
some value to having that

475
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.420
central Lusatian on that scale

476
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.360
SB three fifty requires all of

477
00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.810
the load serving entities within

478
00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.430
their C. C. A.'s electricity

479
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.670
service providers for investor

480
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:05.950
owned utilities to happily sixty

481
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.790
five percent of their our PS

482
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.950
eligible contract procurement

483
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.300
from contracts that are ten

484
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.940
years or longer they have to

485
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.560
do that by twenty twenty one

486
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.640
that's a real challenge for

487
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.990
some of these the the providers

488
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.930
like the CCA's in the S. P.'s

489
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.040
so based on -- just use some

490
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.660
information it was more of

491
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.270
readily available to us based

492
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.050
on the CCA's renewable that

493
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.540
short calculations and that

494
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.280
was presented to us in our --

495
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.980
in our to October thirtieth

496
00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.450
two thousand eighteen our PS

497
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.710
report the CCA's will have

498
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.600
an immediate C. R. renewable

499
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.180
portfolio procurement need of

500
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.430
about six thousand nine hundred

501
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.410
-- can get what hours beginning

502
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.860
in twenty twenty the current

503
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.070
load forecasts -- indicate

504
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.580
their overall need would be

505
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.650
about sixteen thousand gigawatt

506
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.900
hours and twenty twenty that's

507
00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.730
that's a step up in a talk a

508
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.110
little bit in terms of just the

509
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.760
peak capacity of what they've

510
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.080
been able to picture so again

511
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.950
they stay indicate to us they

512
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.360
are two gigawatts of renewable

513
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.550
energy projects that are on

514
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.040
development or already built

515
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.940
to serve load by twenty twenty

516
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.920
that's a list of about fifty

517
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.170
six projects that the total two

518
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.700
thousand one hundred and

519
00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.190
thirteen megawatts we don't know

520
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.600
if all those projects will be

521
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.800
constructed my experience with

522
00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.030
with the large projects that I

523
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.650
worked on between two thousand

524
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.890
and eight and two thousand

525
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.320
fourteen before I came to the

526
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.500
P. you say is it takes a lot

527
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.110
are you we were successful in

528
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.040
getting over over a hundred

529
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.900
and fifty large projects

530
00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.230
over a hundred and megawatts

531
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.500
and it was -- it was a complex

532
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.140
task to permit interconnecting

533
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.980
in and help them seek financing

534
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.000
so I just will say it I think

535
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.050
it's going to be a challenge

536
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.280
the average project size of the

537
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.430
the the projects that currently

538
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.680
are indicated by CCA's as to be

539
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.350
under contract is about forty

540
00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.610
megawatts but the median size

541
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.400
that means half of them are are

542
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.400
are are small our small because

543
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:13.600
this size or smaller is about

544
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.820
a hundred and seventy five

545
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.760
megawatts so at that media

546
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.710
projects sides of the CCA's

547
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.990
would need to procure more

548
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.500
than five thousand seven

549
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.580
hundred additional projects to

550
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.780
add a total of ten gigabytes

551
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.300
to California's electrical

552
00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.620
grids which is a challenge

553
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.520
the challenge that's two orders

554
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.450
of magnitude larger than what

555
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.280
they've done so far fifty six

556
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.660
projects Hannah and that that

557
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.380
will that will that will be a

558
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.680
challenge it's made a little

559
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.720
more difficult because my many

560
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.860
of them may have customers

561
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.140
but they don't have experience

562
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.390
they don't -- assets so it's

563
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:51.920
hard to establish a ballot

564
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.200
she and to get financing from

565
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.500
many of the normal sources now

566
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.950
I'm I'm just using them as an

567
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.170
example because we had better

568
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.590
information on the projects

569
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.330
electricity surprise service

570
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.570
providers have some of the same

571
00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:06.390
problems but they're usually

572
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.540
this many of the successful

573
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.740
yes peas not all are actually

574
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.110
out of state utilities who

575
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.230
own a lot of generation and

576
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.710
what they do is they sell some

577
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.060
of their excess power into the

578
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.530
California market through these

579
00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.910
electricity service provider

580
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.840
contracts they are not bound by

581
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.990
geography that their opt in

582
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.770
which means a customer has

583
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.190
to choose them versus the

584
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.850
CCA's which are opt out so

585
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.580
-- but they're having the same

586
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.220
kinds of problems I'll just the

587
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.110
they have real it relatively

588
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.810
-- significant the procurement

589
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.780
challenges as well subsidies

590
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.480
different topic so all both

591
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.290
net net energy majors solar

592
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.340
CCA's and electricity service

593
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.530
providers don't pay their full

594
00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.600
share of the fixed costs to the

595
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.150
system and this is a problem

596
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.230
that we've been struggling

597
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.050
to deal with than a couple of

598
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.600
different settings we're making

599
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.400
progress in the the P. C. I. A.

600
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:09.610
we have more to go it's a very

601
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.910
controversial project at one

602
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.510
point many of the parties wanted

603
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.720
this to move very quickly but as

604
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.150
they got into it all of the said

605
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.320
they wanted this to take more

606
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.660
time because they really had a

607
00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.540
lot that they wanted to discuss

608
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:25.540
were losing this market scale

609
00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:27.120
that I described before that was

610
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.500
helpful to getting that hundred

611
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.380
and fifty are projects of a

612
00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.130
hundred megawatts a larger --

613
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.480
it's just specially going to be

614
00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.350
a challenge and new technologies

615
00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:38.050
like battery storage you want

616
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.300
to reach -- scale the people

617
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.260
can do a lot of good innovative

618
00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.070
small projects but not many

619
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.520
of them if you really want to

620
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.060
scale quickly then you want to

621
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.620
have large a large companies

622
00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.790
with big balance sheets to

623
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:51.000
be able to move a quickly

624
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.350
liability I know that mark

625
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:54.790
Crossley or probably speak a

626
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:56.840
little bit to this but just will

627
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.870
quickly up until last year

628
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.990
we maybe had two requests

629
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.460
for waivers from our resource

630
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.470
adequacy requirements this is a

631
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.750
fundamental requirement of the

632
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.690
California legislature after

633
00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:13.440
the the the energy crisis

634
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.200
to two thousand two thousand one

635
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.600
it says that you must have

636
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.880
under contract and available

637
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.140
as much electricity as you'll

638
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.160
need for that biggest day of

639
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.880
service of your customers in the

640
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.760
year so two waivers

641
00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.210
where people couldn't get it for

642
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.670
one reason or another last year

643
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.630
we had eleven waivers mostly

644
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.250
CCA's and and E. S. P. S.

645
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.120
this year we expect to have

646
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.930
another eleven it's tough

647
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.150
because when you get into

648
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.310
a small geographic area and

649
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:47.880
your serving customers there

650
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.620
there may not be enough

651
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.230
transmission to bring power

652
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.380
in from outside on those

653
00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.340
big peak days so you need

654
00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.770
to have a contract with some

655
00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.340
generation that's within that

656
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.930
load pocket and if you can't

657
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.160
get that because you don't

658
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.960
have the ability to compete for

659
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.370
a contract because you don't

660
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.120
have a big enough ballot she

661
00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:10.690
you're asking us for a waiver

662
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.290
ice consider that to be a

663
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.820
weakness in the design I think

664
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.100
it's a big problem we are

665
00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.680
currently working on that we've

666
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.400
required rather than one year

667
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.050
contract because of the changes

668
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:22.090
in whose actually serving

669
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.000
electricity we're now requiring

670
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.240
three year contract that may

671
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.650
make it easier for people to

672
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:28.890
get contracts with some of those

673
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.120
generators we don't know if that

674
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.360
fails to materialize by the end

675
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.790
of the summer we may actually

676
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.640
impose a Central buyer and

677
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.020
there's currently a legislative

678
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.620
proposal to do that as well

679
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.020
so I just say that this is one

680
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.470
of the things that scares me

681
00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.380
you may be a small company

682
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.210
but your failure to provide

683
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.730
electricity your customers

684
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.670
can cause a brown out they can

685
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:56.430
escalate in it can actually

686
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.830
affect customers in somebody

687
00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.500
else's service area so

688
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.850
-- you know it

689
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:07.140
it's it's it's it's a challenge

690
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.850
I think we need to develop a

691
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.800
backstop for business failures

692
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.690
we've seen it happen before in

693
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:15.040
two thousand two thousand one we

694
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.790
saw in San Diego a small

695
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:20.190
electricity service provider who

696
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.000
was operating in the deregulated

697
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.120
environment similar to what

698
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.560
some of the new providers are

699
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.110
doing and they had didn't have

700
00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.180
that resource adequacy they

701
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.980
were in a tight market the whole

702
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.610
west was really hot for a two

703
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.410
week period all of the access

704
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.190
electricity was going at premium

705
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.840
prices this is even before we

706
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.400
started to detect the gaming

707
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.380
and this company had not put

708
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.910
enough money aside to be able

709
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.370
to buy all the electricity they

710
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:50.190
need they were hemorrhaging cash

711
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.860
they went bankrupt two hundred

712
00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.250
fifty thousand customers were

713
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.300
dumped in the lap of -- of the

714
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.540
incumbent electric utility who

715
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.200
had not counted on having a

716
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.560
quarter million customers show

717
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.150
up and say we need electricity

718
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.830
so all of a sudden day were

719
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:05.930
paying a premium price for the

720
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.510
failure of this other company so

721
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.080
we need a backstops to prevent

722
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.340
that from happening again

723
00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.730
customer protections I talked

724
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.350
a little bad about predatory

725
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:16.050
marketing in the pace market we

726
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:17.370
have lots of indications that

727
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.710
happens in the nam -- around

728
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.580
we need to talk a little bit

729
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.950
about what's the pathway of

730
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:25.820
these processes continue for

731
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.110
the regulated utilities to

732
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.760
get rid of some of their fixed

733
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.690
costs public goods program

734
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.290
what happens to them so

735
00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:36.730
all of the care programs and

736
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:38.910
other Ste I'll just say that

737
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.340
we looked a lot about this era

738
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:43.190
I think you all got copies of

739
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:45.240
our two reports the first is

740
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.080
actually our study of four

741
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.040
different markets where they've

742
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.470
tried these different models to

743
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:52.780
see what worked and what didn't

744
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.340
work how they dealt with this

745
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.120
provider of last resort for the

746
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:57.670
customers who might get dumped

747
00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:59.530
how they dealt with reliability

748
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.900
and then here's our plan

749
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.270
going for now say that that

750
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.990
I'm in I am very honored but

751
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.400
the legislators of started

752
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.940
to write bills out of this to

753
00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.190
actually address some of the

754
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.910
weaknesses that we've detected

755
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.500
I think that's helpful I

756
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.930
can't take a position on him

757
00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:17.750
yeah because they're still

758
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.460
doing the fiscal analysis to

759
00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:21.000
share with the department of

760
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.910
finance without which were

761
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:24.360
not allowed to take a position

762
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.210
but -- I'm confident that the

763
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:28.730
legislature is starting to see

764
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.130
some of the same risks that we

765
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:31.660
are starting to move forward

766
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.140
so I'll be happy to take

767
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.260
your questions perhaps

768
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.680
after the other two --

769
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.780
gentleman of presented

770
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.390
thank you brother picker

771
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.330
-- yes we'll take some

772
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:46.900
questions after the next two

773
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.120
presenters and -- Austin brown

774
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.540
-- Europe and then followed by

775
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.640
mark eight then thank you Mister

776
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.740
chairman and and thank you to

777
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.710
the committee for having here

778
00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:00.310
today -- a to talk about this

779
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.440
is -- issue of utmost urgency

780
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.050
right were utterly reliant on

781
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.160
a reliable electric grid -- and

782
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.250
yet facing some pretty amazing a

783
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.480
new challenges were asking that

784
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.310
great to accomplish for us --

785
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.210
so I think it's it's a really

786
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.820
timely issuance really privilege

787
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.580
to be here thank you -- my name

788
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.370
is Austin brown I direct the

789
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:18.780
UC Davis policy institute for

790
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:20.510
energy environment economy --

791
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.640
we attempt to help make the

792
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.890
current research that's out

793
00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:25.730
there available to -- exactly

794
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:26.420
that's what the people in

795
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.470
this room our making research

796
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:30.310
informed decisions affecting

797
00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:31.340
the future of our energy and

798
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.960
transportation systems so

799
00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.100
I've tried to put together a few

800
00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.620
slides that contain some sort

801
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.390
of -- background information

802
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:40.570
if you're a visual person like

803
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.290
me you might I might use those

804
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:43.450
is the one that's got my name

805
00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:45.640
on the front -- -- if you're

806
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.100
not a visual person then you

807
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.040
can just listen I will try

808
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.760
to cover the main points --

809
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.260
and if you're really in it

810
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:52.610
for just the summary that the

811
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.680
first slide after the title

812
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.170
fight has the the big picture

813
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.650
summary so I can go over that

814
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.970
and then -- if that's all you

815
00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.910
want you can tune out -- or --

816
00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:00.850
listen on and I'll try to go

817
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.020
into a little bit more detail

818
01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.730
-- with some of these other --

819
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.020
some of these other points --

820
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.860
every got one -- so

821
01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:10.440
so the summary which I'll try

822
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.730
to list here is that California

823
01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:13.920
really is doing an amazing

824
01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.160
job of leading terms of clean

825
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.560
energy goals we're reaching

826
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.770
further in many ways than other

827
01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:18.700
states and really any other

828
01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.740
country -- -- on the planet

829
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.470
and so far we've seen that

830
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.490
are grade is generally up to

831
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:27.690
the task -- and reliability

832
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.580
is doing -- at least stable

833
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:30.730
by most of our conventional

834
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.510
metrics that just look at how

835
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:34.050
many hours of time are we as

836
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.360
the average customer losing to a

837
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.250
blackout -- but other worries

838
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.030
raised by researchers another's

839
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.550
about potential brittleness

840
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.240
in the system and because

841
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.060
the grid and reliable across

842
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.290
the supply is so critical --

843
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.410
that means that we need to be

844
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:49.600
thinking in advance we can't

845
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.170
wait for the system to break to

846
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.410
understand that we need to fix

847
01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.330
-- so in particular I call

848
01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:57.670
that for challenges on within

849
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:58.680
considerable overlap with

850
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.070
present picker that'll hopefully

851
01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:01.060
let me to be more efficient with

852
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.390
with covering them since they've

853
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.260
already been discussed to some

854
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.180
extent -- that are there facing

855
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.390
the grade and some of these are

856
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.720
of course also opportunities

857
01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.880
right none of these are are

858
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.650
bad things are all really --

859
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:12.690
important features of our system

860
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.070
they just could provide of new

861
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.510
challenges the systems you go

862
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:16.720
and the for the -- call out

863
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.480
our integration of variable

864
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.890
renewable energy so that's wind

865
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.150
and solar photovoltaics -- the

866
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:23.350
incorporation of new business

867
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:24.950
models with specific focus on

868
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.800
the -- impressive growth of of

869
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.320
CCA's looking at incorporating

870
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.680
electric vehicles into our great

871
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:32.200
and with special notice to the

872
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.250
kinds of benefits they could

873
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.460
potentially provide to the grid

874
01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.370
and then the on the present

875
01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:38.110
challenge -- of climate change

876
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.320
other were tempting to deal

877
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.610
with from vacation perspective

878
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.950
can also offers significan

879
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.100
adaptation challenges to the

880
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.380
great is the over arching

881
01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.360
question which will just begin

882
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.930
to touch on is and how high

883
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:48.150
can clean energy immigration

884
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:49.490
go with our current grade and

885
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:50.670
what those integration options

886
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.790
are to help us do more I'm

887
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.350
so next line I have a map --

888
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.720
of from the Lawrence Berkley

889
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.980
lab of the current renewable

890
01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.220
portfolio standards and just

891
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.290
to make the point that a states

892
01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.890
have been key drivers of clean

893
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.550
energy policy and none more so

894
01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.570
than California and that doesn't

895
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:07.610
even include a hundred percent

896
01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.370
clean energy goal -- by twenty

897
01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.260
forty five -- that that's now

898
01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.410
it really that the big target

899
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.450
in the electricity sector on to

900
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:15.430
California's been a big leader

901
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.960
there the state policies have

902
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.140
really helped get renewables

903
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.660
and other clean energy sources

904
01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:20.740
I'm to the place that they

905
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.920
are -- where they are today

906
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.810
-- so the next looks at the

907
01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:29.460
what we would face as we move

908
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.870
towards ultra high levels of

909
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.560
variable renewable energy and

910
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.610
this comes from a national

911
01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.410
renewable energy lab report --

912
01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:36.580
I should have actually tried to

913
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.510
avoid using any a public utility

914
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.050
commission or I SO charts and

915
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.250
reports year that's not because

916
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.190
I don't think that's important

917
01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.640
as to want to try to tell my

918
01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.030
colleagues -- what what their

919
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:46.080
own reports say so I really

920
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.330
try to focus on national lab

921
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.970
in university -- university

922
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.970
sources here so this is from

923
01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.560
a national energy lab study

924
01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.280
and each dot on this chart is

925
01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.920
a essentially a grid and it's

926
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.910
craft on the X. axis but system

927
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:02.030
size the bigger grades are to

928
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:03.830
the right of that chart and then

929
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.850
on the Y. axis the percentage of

930
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:07.670
wind and solar and so you see is

931
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.930
that so far it's only relatively

932
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.570
small grids on the scale of a

933
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:13.050
single city or single island

934
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.070
but we might think of as a big

935
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.600
microcredit that have been able

936
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.870
to incorporate very high levels

937
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.440
of renewable energy and they're

938
01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.680
usually because they don't have

939
01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.560
a larger great as an option we

940
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.980
had to see some countries like

941
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.050
Denmark and Ireland right in the

942
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.340
middle there that have started

943
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.420
to incorporate relatively

944
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.310
high levels -- and then we see

945
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:29.730
California since this report

946
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.350
we've moved up that access is

947
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.600
we've added more wind and solar

948
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.440
-- but what the report found

949
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.040
was that immigration options

950
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.510
work right now to get up to

951
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:39.330
around the twenty five percent

952
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.220
of variable renewable energy but

953
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.500
getting beyond that to the sorts

954
01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.760
of fifty percent -- of variable

955
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.790
renewable energy that we would

956
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.010
need to to accomplish our clean

957
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.780
energy goals will require new

958
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.700
policies and new efforts that

959
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.770
the great as it's currently

960
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.340
designed today would find it

961
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.390
challenging to incorporate

962
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.620
renewals up to that level

963
01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.430
we also see that report not

964
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.470
shown here that diversity is

965
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.010
incredibly important so you

966
01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.800
can't rely on only one source

967
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.060
you want complement resources

968
01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.130
both by type of rules by type

969
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.020
of energy generation -- and then

970
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.690
also by geography so that we

971
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:12.660
integrate -- energy resources

972
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.370
from a wider variety it's much

973
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:15.920
less likely that the wind will

974
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.860
not be blowing in multiple

975
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.240
places at once and the bigger

976
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.430
of an area you can integrate

977
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.710
the more you're able to mitigate

978
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.350
that challenge on the next

979
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.180
new challenge facing electric

980
01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.150
grid that I want to highlight

981
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:27.370
-- present picker already

982
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:28.720
mentioned we see a really

983
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.990
dramatic gross in community

984
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:32.220
choice on the map shown shows

985
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.600
the sort of current status

986
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.550
of the different community --

987
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.450
choice programs and -- their

988
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:38.990
dramatic growth and then the

989
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.790
right side shows up from --

990
01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:43.160
UCLA report -- shows that by

991
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.050
and large these programs have

992
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.140
higher levels of clean renewable

993
01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.610
energy then the -- the utility

994
01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:51.270
sources that they are replacing

995
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.100
as a generation source so this

996
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.390
is provided a lot of value to

997
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.670
customers and they've often

998
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.430
able to source new generation

999
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:58.900
it at relatively low prices

1000
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:01.270
-- but it does potentially if

1001
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:02.700
not done carefully dissociate

1002
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.850
the sourcing of power from

1003
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:05.260
the planning process and

1004
01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.320
can create new challenges in

1005
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.120
terms of ensuring reliability

1006
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:08.990
I think of him more about

1007
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.980
that on the second panel

1008
01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:12.890
on the third trend which is

1009
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:14.580
maybe one that could provide

1010
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.210
a lot of benefits if -- if

1011
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.640
integrated with smart policy in

1012
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.590
good research based approach is

1013
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.980
the transition towards electric

1014
01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.710
vehicles so independent of our

1015
01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.440
religious the goals California

1016
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.320
has very strong policies --

1017
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.490
developing new markets for

1018
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.210
lectured vehicles right now

1019
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.460
the vast majorities vehicles

1020
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.540
are just plugged in whenever

1021
01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.770
it's convenient for the driver

1022
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:35.720
of that vehicle but it's --

1023
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.690
entirely chief both technically

1024
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.500
to make those vehicles charge

1025
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.310
whenever the greed has surplus

1026
01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:43.320
capacity to do so so this is a

1027
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.970
graph shown from a demonstration

1028
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.520
project -- with about a

1029
01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.310
hundred vehicles between BMW

1030
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.030
M. P. Jeannie just an example

1031
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.270
tonight's you know small scale

1032
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.180
compared what we would need to

1033
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.330
be doing but you can see that

1034
01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:56.680
these vehicles -- so the the

1035
01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.260
the bottom a chart shows the

1036
01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.790
solar power coming on during

1037
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.930
the daytime and then the Orange

1038
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.620
Line is when those vehicles are

1039
01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.390
charging and so they're set to

1040
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.800
essentially charge when they're

1041
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.150
surplus solar available on the

1042
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:10.070
grid and it macroscale we know

1043
01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:11.460
that before too long we're

1044
01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.610
gonna have a surplus during the

1045
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:14.430
daytime of solar on most sunny

1046
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:15.740
days and it's already happened

1047
01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.110
on a few days so if you could

1048
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:18.310
set up select vehicles are

1049
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:19.410
basically able to soak up that

1050
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.090
demand and potentially as a

1051
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.430
curse a couple of times in this

1052
01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:24.510
a demonstration project tensely

1053
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:25.710
return some of that power to

1054
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.550
the grid in times when prices

1055
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.500
are high and demand is high

1056
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:31.030
and supply is less available

1057
01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.070
so that's more integration

1058
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:34.160
of luck vehicles could be an

1059
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.950
enormous -- asset that can help

1060
01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.120
manage excuse me I manage

1061
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.290
the future of the grid the

1062
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.680
last risk and -- the one that

1063
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.630
I think even if we act now

1064
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.010
-- we will be dealing with

1065
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.780
for a very long time -- is

1066
01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.700
the increasing risks that

1067
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.030
climate provides to the grid

1068
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.150
-- so -- there's challenges

1069
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.120
to essentially every single

1070
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.120
one of our -- energy supplies

1071
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.630
that can be made worse into

1072
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.080
a world of a changing climate

1073
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:01.890
-- risk from warmer water

1074
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:03.050
supplies can actually make

1075
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.840
thermal generation from example

1076
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.350
for example natural gas less

1077
01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.920
efficient -- and in some cases

1078
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.070
at the temperatures get to

1079
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.900
hide plants are then unable to

1080
01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.360
operate -- warmer weather can

1081
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.440
also make transmission line

1082
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.990
sagging can lower efficiency

1083
01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:19.820
-- at the potential for drought

1084
01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.330
-- would affect hydro power

1085
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.510
supplies we actually seen

1086
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.770
that several times of the past

1087
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.600
years and increased drought --

1088
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.780
potentially -- sustain drought

1089
01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.180
due to climate change a could

1090
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.800
exacerbate that problem I'm

1091
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.890
changes in weather patterns

1092
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:32.250
like clouds and wind patterns

1093
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.370
could affect our ability to

1094
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:34.990
forecast the future of solar

1095
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:37.650
and wind -- and it would affect

1096
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.390
Cooley demand which is a in some

1097
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.920
cases the dominant -- energy

1098
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.910
demand at different times of

1099
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:43.210
day out and that's without

1100
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:44.410
even getting into wildfires

1101
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:45.140
which I think we'll have to

1102
01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.260
leave for deferred discussion

1103
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:47.940
about which would expects to

1104
01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:49.240
to increase dramatically in the

1105
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:50.900
the woman climate were CA so

1106
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.480
that provides this over arching

1107
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:54.570
the challenge that we're going

1108
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.720
to have to ask our great to

1109
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.890
be able to -- to handle all in

1110
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.490
the context of incorporating

1111
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:00.570
the new clean energy options

1112
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:01.730
we need to avoid making the

1113
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:03.560
climate challenge even worse

1114
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.140
as we go so the good news at

1115
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.650
the end is that there are many

1116
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.060
immigration options available

1117
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.710
-- if we can accomplish this

1118
01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.300
energy transition in a measured

1119
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.710
and effective in research driven

1120
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:14.970
away I'm I won't go through

1121
01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:16.290
all of them we tend to think

1122
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.180
of storage as the one that we

1123
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.220
would just want to incorporate

1124
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:20.600
but there's many options that

1125
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.840
are probably cheaper in most

1126
01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.450
contexts so there's options

1127
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.170
in efficient system operation

1128
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:27.070
in the development of a new

1129
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:28.800
an efficient markets -- in

1130
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.880
managing load in some cases so

1131
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.510
there's a already examples of

1132
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:34.640
that industrial -- context but

1133
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.720
be able to expand that into

1134
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.060
other kinds of flexible load

1135
01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:38.720
I'm having flexible generation

1136
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.100
available to meet unexpected

1137
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.080
demands -- improve networks

1138
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.710
and then incorporating storage

1139
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:44.690
where it makes the most sense

1140
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.510
in the grid so a research in

1141
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:48.290
forming part portfolio -- based

1142
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.910
approach is needed here and I

1143
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:50.980
really applaud the committee

1144
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980
for taking on this issue

1145
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.170
that way thank you very much

1146
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.860
thank you for the opportunity

1147
01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.960
for -- presenting this

1148
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960
important topic -- my name

1149
01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.040
is mark profit arm the vice

1150
01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.320
president market quality

1151
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.510
and renewable integration

1152
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:06.960
of the California IRA so

1153
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.790
yes -- manages the high voltage

1154
01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:11.850
power grid a and runs the

1155
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.520
wholesale market for about

1156
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.170
eighty percent of California

1157
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.660
be touching on three points --

1158
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:20.490
and those point to built around

1159
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.210
our responsibility as bouncing

1160
01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.850
area those responsibilities

1161
01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.160
include balancing supply and

1162
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.100
demand on a second by second

1163
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.590
basis ensuring security

1164
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:30.670
of the system meaning we

1165
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.590
don't overload any lines and

1166
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:35.360
we are prepared for loss

1167
01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.030
of a line or element without

1168
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.290
overloading the parallel line

1169
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.800
-- then maintaining reserves

1170
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.250
if we lose a resource we have

1171
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.580
to have sufficient reserve

1172
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.820
capability to ramp up in case

1173
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.400
we lose a resource at any given

1174
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.560
time and our last responsibility

1175
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.340
is around restoration if we

1176
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.110
have a major blackout and we

1177
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:55.410
have to restore the system

1178
01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.690
do we have the resources and

1179
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.140
the capability to restore the

1180
01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.350
system my comments today are

1181
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:01.650
largely focusing around the

1182
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:04.070
balancing responsibility and the

1183
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:05.710
challenges that are were facing

1184
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.370
in that area and forget

1185
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.890
jump into those three points

1186
01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:12.060
I I kind of the equivalent

1187
01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:15.370
Z. the challenge of changing

1188
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:18.340
a all four tires of your car

1189
01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.340
while driving down a bumpy road

1190
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.400
at the same time and --

1191
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:27.080
and all the tires are being

1192
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.430
purchased by not you the driver

1193
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.070
but multiple people out in

1194
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.830
the industry that are bringing

1195
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.110
you the tires so the point is

1196
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:36.560
that there's a timing issue

1197
01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.460
there's a sequencing issue and

1198
01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:42.360
-- it it's a juggling act

1199
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:44.630
to say the least the three

1200
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:45.620
points are gonna be touching

1201
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.640
on is is the fact that

1202
01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.740
-- in balancing supply and

1203
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.670
demand we have increased

1204
01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:53.470
variable resources and we must

1205
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:55.850
dispatch other resources down

1206
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.070
or increased demand when we have

1207
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.250
a surplus of supply at the

1208
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.680
same time when those very well

1209
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.680
resources are not producing we

1210
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.070
need to be able to balance the

1211
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:07.050
system by your ramping up other

1212
01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:09.530
resources during those times

1213
01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.070
currently the second point is

1214
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:13.970
that the natural gas fleet is

1215
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.310
currently used and many of

1216
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:17.760
those times when we have to make

1217
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.320
up for that supply that's not

1218
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.750
delivered by very well resources

1219
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.820
lastly -- imports also

1220
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.310
make up to the -- --

1221
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.120
supply when we are insufficient

1222
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.120
with a not very well resources

1223
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.150
and those times that were not

1224
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.560
insist were insufficient for

1225
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.530
resources are not infrequent

1226
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.840
okay and I'll get into that

1227
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.080
more as I discussed this

1228
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.700
all the factors point to a

1229
01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.330
trend as we transition to a

1230
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:49.100
low carbon grid that I also

1231
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.750
may find meeting its demand

1232
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.150
when the renewable supply is

1233
01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:53.690
not producing such as evenings

1234
01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:55.480
are stormy day is becoming

1235
01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.470
more and more difficult and

1236
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:59.320
therefore we'll all need to find

1237
01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.800
innovative solutions that work

1238
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.870
together to reliably operate

1239
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.170
the grid I will expand upon

1240
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:08.060
these points and the innovative

1241
01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.670
solutions that the we should

1242
01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:13.320
consider at as a as I assembly

1243
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.370
is a must be considered to

1244
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:16.030
address these operational needs

1245
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.630
at a reasonable cost as the

1246
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:19.900
great continues to reduce

1247
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.550
reliance on emitting resources

1248
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:25.490
California has a diverse set

1249
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:27.840
of resource -- than resource

1250
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.750
mix in the mix is continuing

1251
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.510
to evolve the single most

1252
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.340
significant change over the last

1253
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.320
few years has been the rise of

1254
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:39.010
renewable energy currently

1255
01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:40.810
the over the years we've we've

1256
01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.890
got to the point where about

1257
01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.820
one third of our demand is

1258
01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.650
being met over the year by

1259
01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.480
renewable resources but from

1260
01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.080
the operator perspective we look

1261
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.490
at more ground yearly what is

1262
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:51.900
it happening on any given dot

1263
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.410
day or given our and what we've

1264
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:55.830
seen is that we've seen as much

1265
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.520
as more than seventy percent

1266
01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.130
on a given our of the demand

1267
01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:02.670
being met by actual renewable

1268
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.570
resources in fact we've

1269
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:07.690
had we've on may twenty six

1270
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:09.790
of last year we get the point

1271
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.300
where ninety three percent

1272
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.940
almost a hundred percent of our

1273
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.860
demand instantaneous the man

1274
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.770
was being met by carbon free

1275
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.280
resources if you include nuclear

1276
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.940
and -- hydro resources so we

1277
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.190
are being we're we're making

1278
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.950
success the last I want to

1279
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:27.400
make on this is that as we

1280
01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.250
as a result we have actually

1281
01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.970
reduced twenty two percent

1282
01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.470
of but reduced carbon

1283
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:35.500
emissions from our dispatch

1284
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.510
relative to twenty fourteen

1285
01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.460
levels by twenty two percent

1286
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.040
these numbers all indicate

1287
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.250
we are making significant

1288
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.520
progress towards meeting the

1289
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.420
state's climate goals and

1290
01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.330
that Wilk need to continue to

1291
01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:51.380
unfold opportunities including

1292
01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.990
technological advances and

1293
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:55.260
pioneering policies to support

1294
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.070
the shift to a greener grid

1295
01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.230
of the future but as we do

1296
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:01.160
so we all my we also must

1297
01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.080
remain mindful of the growing

1298
01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.510
operational challenge we are

1299
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.260
facing why will you

1300
01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:09.050
why would we will continue to

1301
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.610
reduce our reliance in carbon

1302
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.530
emitting resources there will

1303
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:14.320
remain periods when solar

1304
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.600
and wind production falls off

1305
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.140
in the near term during such

1306
01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.620
conditions will continue to

1307
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.510
rely on gas generating plants

1308
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.570
as well as imports to serve the

1309
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.910
demand and maintain reliability

1310
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:30.720
in the long term we will need to

1311
01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.060
deploy other technologies and

1312
01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.720
systems including things like

1313
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.100
storage or repurpose ceasing

1314
01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.270
the gas generation fleet to use

1315
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.950
renewable gas in order to

1316
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.270
reduce the carbon footprint

1317
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.370
of maintaining reliability

1318
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.890
to achieve this fundamental

1319
01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.830
transit transformation we will

1320
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.720
need careful consideration about

1321
01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.820
sequencing timing technical

1322
01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.070
capability and the cost of

1323
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:59.490
replacement alternatives to

1324
01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:01.520
the gas fleet to ensure we

1325
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.630
maintain reliability during this

1326
01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:06.670
transition why will you while

1327
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.980
we expect to have and be

1328
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.240
able to leverage periods when

1329
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.620
we have abundance of clean

1330
01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.340
supply we must also be prepared

1331
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:16.810
to meet the demand when those

1332
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160
cloudy days when those --

1333
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.350
or when there's little solar

1334
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:23.210
production we observe on days

1335
01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.870
with significant cloud cover

1336
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.160
like we've had experience

1337
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.280
recently across the state that

1338
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.580
soul resources can read can

1339
01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:32.410
reduce reduce in production

1340
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.760
relative to their cat capacity

1341
01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.580
to only ten percent or twenty

1342
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.820
percent of their installed

1343
01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.330
capacity we have more than

1344
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:41.950
twelve thousand megawatts

1345
01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.880
of resources now on the grid

1346
01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.440
that's not including the behind

1347
01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.470
the meters -- solar resources

1348
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.970
so in a lot since January

1349
01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:52.430
of last year with that

1350
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:53.940
amount of capacity we have

1351
01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.880
experience about twenty days

1352
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.610
when solar production actually

1353
01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.400
fell below five thousand

1354
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.440
megawatts relative to its troll

1355
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.150
thousand megawatts capacity

1356
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.350
indeed on January fourteenth

1357
01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.640
from January fourteenth

1358
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.080
January seventeenth of this

1359
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.630
year we actually saw the

1360
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.690
four consecutive days that

1361
01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.830
the production was the maximum

1362
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:18.240
production for the day of the

1363
01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.000
solar was as little as two

1364
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.510
thousand and as high as four

1365
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.660
thousand megawatts so that we

1366
01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.870
can have sustained long periods

1367
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.400
of of lack of production from

1368
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.800
these renewable of variable

1369
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.780
resources I just spoke

1370
01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.660
about the grid side on the

1371
01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.710
behind a meter side we have

1372
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:38.510
about six thousand megawatts of

1373
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.870
the band now being met by

1374
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:42.920
behind the meter solar resources

1375
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:46.280
similarly when we have the cloud

1376
01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.170
cover about eighty percent

1377
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:51.020
of that six thousand megawatts

1378
01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.110
demand comebacks comes comes

1379
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:54.720
back on to the system and

1380
01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.270
requires us to be able to serve

1381
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.050
that so if you consider the

1382
01:16:58.050 --> 01:16:59.630
grid side and the behind a meter

1383
01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:01.940
side between a cloudy day and

1384
01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.200
a non cloudy day you can have

1385
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.450
as much as fourteen thousand

1386
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:06.750
megawatts swinging in terms of

1387
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.510
renewable production and when

1388
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:10.420
you do all that production

1389
01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:11.910
doesn't exist or doesn't

1390
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:13.170
produce you have to make that

1391
01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.980
up fourteen thousand megawatts

1392
01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.410
of the Cuillin to about seven

1393
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.560
nuclear units of resources

1394
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.170
since twenty fourteen we have

1395
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:25.290
been discussing the change

1396
01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:26.910
an operational conditions

1397
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.320
since then we've we've been

1398
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.860
watching in managing over

1399
01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.220
supply in the middle of the

1400
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.610
day while the at the end of the

1401
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:35.170
day we managed that spike of

1402
01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:36.770
demand that have to meet the

1403
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.660
evening ramp when the sun was

1404
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.500
setting the increase in these

1405
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.040
challenges hasn't come faster

1406
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.180
than we had expected because

1407
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.450
the successful adoption of

1408
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.830
solar generation in the Golden

1409
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.920
State we now are projecting

1410
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.440
that will need between fifteen

1411
01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.140
and twenty thousand megawatts

1412
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.480
to be able to be ramps in

1413
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.050
over a three hour period

1414
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:58.970
as I pointed out in my beginning

1415
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.580
testimony the evening ramps

1416
01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.900
currently being served by a

1417
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.950
combination of imports and

1418
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:06.240
gas resources as well as hydro

1419
01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:09.270
what we've observed is that

1420
01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.070
the reliance on imports is

1421
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:12.520
becoming more challenging there

1422
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.360
are increasing periods of time

1423
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.070
where the especially in during

1424
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:17.900
the highest low periods where

1425
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.450
there's a scarcity of supply

1426
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.830
outside the area because that

1427
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:23.390
generation is meeting the demand

1428
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.880
outside the area it may not

1429
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.600
be available so what we have

1430
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.890
thirteen thousand megawatts

1431
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:29.860
of import capacity wires in

1432
01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.750
the air to support that we

1433
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:34.030
see like it last year during

1434
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:36.000
our peak conditions only three

1435
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.390
thousand megawatts of imports

1436
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:39.680
coming in so if we assume

1437
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.390
that there's going to be ten

1438
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:42.570
thousand megawatts we may

1439
01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:44.460
be assuming in correctly the

1440
01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.220
availability we need to secure

1441
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.190
that if we're going to rely upon

1442
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.690
the economic lastly the

1443
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:53.750
economics of the existing

1444
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.350
ghastly is changing the

1445
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:56.650
renewable energy production has

1446
01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.130
brought holes whole sale energy

1447
01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:02.290
prices down as well capacity

1448
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:04.400
payments are going toward a

1449
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.200
renewable resort resources as

1450
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.810
they well should be but that

1451
01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:09.350
results in the fact that these

1452
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:10.860
gas resources are becoming

1453
01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.000
more and more economically

1454
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.080
distressed because they're

1455
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.410
not being picked up through

1456
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:17.160
the resource adequacy and the

1457
01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.340
revenues through the wholesaler

1458
01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.760
you market -- insufficient

1459
01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.420
yet as I previously discussed

1460
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.010
there are times when the system

1461
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.380
will need these resources to

1462
01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.320
be available and if they start

1463
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.130
retiring in large numbers

1464
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.790
we will have those resources

1465
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:34.540
available so the continue

1466
01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.030
down the path of reliable and

1467
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.610
affordable energy supply the

1468
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:39.010
I also recommends that the

1469
01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:40.760
suite of solutions be deployed

1470
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.400
first diversify the resource

1471
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.150
fleet both geographically

1472
01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:46.760
intent technologically at

1473
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.260
this is described earlier

1474
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.710
enable incentives for demand

1475
01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:52.250
participation and increased

1476
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.780
energy efficiency so it's

1477
01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.210
a responsive to the system

1478
01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.960
conditions as these change

1479
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.920
leverage periods of abundance

1480
01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:02.290
clean supply to de carbonized

1481
01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.680
other sectors including the

1482
01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.400
transportation heating and

1483
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.000
cooling sector promote energy

1484
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.870
storage on the system to

1485
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:13.100
capture abundant supply for use

1486
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.770
when the supply other support

1487
01:20:14.770 --> 01:20:16.350
when that supply is scarce

1488
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.980
foster regional collaboration

1489
01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.580
to share an insurer resource

1490
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.400
efficiency across the region

1491
01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.450
ensure all resources including

1492
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.140
renewables are providing

1493
01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.370
essential reliability

1494
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:30.230
services not just energy

1495
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.700
so that the search sufficient

1496
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.880
operation visibility and control

1497
01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.180
those resources bill

1498
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.430
flexibility into all resources

1499
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.970
including the exist making the

1500
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.950
existing gas fleet more flexible

1501
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.670
and then lastly secure import

1502
01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:47.190
capacity if you're gonna rely

1503
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:49.100
upon that so you ensure that's

1504
01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.370
available when you need it

1505
01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.740
using one of these alternate

1506
01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.200
will not solve the challenges

1507
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.430
that we face we'll take a

1508
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:59.890
combination of these solutions

1509
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.340
to meet the reliability needs

1510
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:02.730
and I can't tell you how much

1511
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:04.500
of each at this point I think

1512
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.100
they'll be a a discussion about

1513
01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.880
how to do it at the least cost

1514
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.290
diet so pledges to commit

1515
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.700
at pledges its commitment to

1516
01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.330
work with you all as we plan

1517
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:16.770
and prepare for the future

1518
01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:19.710
thank you very much thank you

1519
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:21.780
that I appreciate all three

1520
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.040
of you coming today in your

1521
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.200
presentation I just wanted

1522
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.700
to kind of laid off with two

1523
01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.600
questions one -- to you --

1524
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.580
Mister Ross letter and then --

1525
01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:32.660
Mister Baker one for you and

1526
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.250
then I'll turn to the members

1527
01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:37.000
of obviously over though it your

1528
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.690
your presentation talk a little

1529
01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:40.100
bit about obviously looking

1530
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.990
at grading greater efficiency

1531
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:43.890
for the grid and how of

1532
01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.750
we can utilize resources

1533
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.320
more efficiently as we look

1534
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.160
at the intermittent periods

1535
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.920
of time when we have solar

1536
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.030
-- not -- working force

1537
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:58.300
or wind -- and --

1538
01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.830
the last couple of years there's

1539
01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:01.120
been the conversation around

1540
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.920
reach allies in the grad and

1541
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.520
now we're talking a bit about

1542
01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.030
the -- resource of the energy

1543
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:09.050
imbalance market as maybe a

1544
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.460
way of growing into a more

1545
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.420
regional as approach can you

1546
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.900
talk a little bit about how

1547
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.570
the hi so is looking at

1548
01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:20.050
of the strategy around and

1549
01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:21.550
energy imbalance market and

1550
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:23.850
how that is going to be

1551
01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.120
of structured in such a way to

1552
01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:27.410
address some of the concerns

1553
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:28.960
and issues that you're sure

1554
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.050
outlined sure and I'll be brief

1555
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:33.010
the -- the motivation of the

1556
01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:34.810
energy about the market was to

1557
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:38.360
-- allow for effectively

1558
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.510
enter our in trial were trading

1559
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:43.680
to occur if it was economically

1560
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.510
beneficial to occur it's helped

1561
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:47.570
with renewable immigration

1562
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:49.500
because it allows police when we

1563
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.420
have a surplus of supply

1564
01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.060
it allows us to actually

1565
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.500
use that supply to dispatch

1566
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.930
other resources in the region

1567
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:59.810
down and then when we are in

1568
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.430
the evening and we need supply

1569
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.410
to come back in we actually can

1570
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:05.220
leverage and use the rest of the

1571
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:07.380
-- energy imbalance market and

1572
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.770
our neighbors to provide that

1573
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.620
supply it builds upon

1574
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.700
the fact that that supplies

1575
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.360
available it doesn't guarantee

1576
01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.580
that that supplies available

1577
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.180
so it really works around

1578
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.640
-- minimizing are maximizing

1579
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.910
the use of the available --

1580
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:25.520
capability and so the point

1581
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.510
I want to make is that it

1582
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:28.370
doesn't address a making sure

1583
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.910
that sufficient supply to is

1584
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:31.630
is available nor does that

1585
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.990
ensure that the right commitment

1586
01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:36.460
of resources is occurring

1587
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.580
on a day ahead basis some of

1588
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.610
these resources you have to

1589
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:40.980
make commitments because they

1590
01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.180
take a long time to start and

1591
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:44.640
that's where we believe we can

1592
01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.810
enhance and leverage the energy

1593
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:48.740
imbalance market and extended

1594
01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.860
into our day ahead market and

1595
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.860
be able to make larger decisions

1596
01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:54.780
commitment decisions day ahead

1597
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.840
doing so we think we'll have

1598
01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.220
significant benefits com and

1599
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.400
leveraging eight and energy

1600
01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.580
amounts market but that

1601
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:05.460
extension into their market does

1602
01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.540
not address the longer term how

1603
01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.120
do you plan the system both from

1604
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.170
a transmission perspective and

1605
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:12.830
and from a resource procurement

1606
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:15.040
perspective it doesn't enable

1607
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.790
that to occur -- there may

1608
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:19.690
be regional opportunities as

1609
01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.160
are still left on the table

1610
01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.930
-- -- if you only go as

1611
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:25.100
far as the day had market

1612
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.130
thank you for that miss

1613
01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:31.570
Parker -- back in February

1614
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:33.860
the commission -- did some

1615
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.020
reforms to the resource

1616
01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.310
adequacy program and and in

1617
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.930
that program there was --

1618
01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:44.600
-- some detailed direction on

1619
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:47.420
-- looking at a capacity --

1620
01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.530
-- I'm sorry not capacity but

1621
01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:52.260
the -- June the central

1622
01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:54.450
procurement you talk a little

1623
01:24:54.450 --> 01:24:55.910
bit about it in your in your

1624
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:59.270
presentation if you're expecting

1625
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:00.690
a report to come back at the

1626
01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:03.000
end of the year and it's gonna

1627
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.420
guests Dillon at how this

1628
01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.500
would have -- be structured

1629
01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.990
what which your assessment on

1630
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:12.650
the reality or the viability

1631
01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:14.980
of having a detailed plan

1632
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.890
for center procurement authority

1633
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.730
in place by the end of the year

1634
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.720
well -- first there was very

1635
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.140
little agreement between all

1636
01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.560
the parties as to whether we

1637
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.140
should have this a centralized

1638
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:31.230
procurement mechanism -- there

1639
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:33.440
was -- there some of folks who

1640
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.800
said bill maybe after we've

1641
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.130
gotten the easy stuff than

1642
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.990
there can be a residual fire

1643
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.780
to take care of the hard stuff

1644
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:42.410
-- nobody's really quite

1645
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.690
come to grips with how you'd

1646
01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:46.130
pay for it -- there are some

1647
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:49.090
people who favor a capacity

1648
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:52.010
market similar to the ones

1649
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:54.030
that we see in other states as

1650
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:56.290
opposed to a bilateral buyer

1651
01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.890
similar to the way that we

1652
01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.630
care -- lecture city contracts

1653
01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:03.520
so that service is waiting

1654
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:05.340
to see if people can develop

1655
01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.500
their thinking a little bit

1656
01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.060
better if there's consensus

1657
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:09.970
what people did agree on

1658
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.590
is it would probably allow

1659
01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:14.990
on some of the smaller players

1660
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:17.100
who have a hard time in really

1661
01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.320
rough and tumble competitive

1662
01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.250
electricity markets to be

1663
01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:23.360
able to get contracts if they

1664
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.920
bought three years ahead they

1665
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.390
might be able to tell a a

1666
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.220
I operator of a power plant

1667
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:30.990
look it's not going to be year

1668
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:32.150
to year we're going to give

1669
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:33.740
you a three year contract are

1670
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.100
you willing to deal with this

1671
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.970
now so that's worth where

1672
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:39.810
we left the decision were asking

1673
01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.280
people to come back and tell

1674
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.860
us what is the best solution

1675
01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:45.360
to trying to make sure that

1676
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.650
there's some way to fill in

1677
01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:48.670
the blanks for all these new

1678
01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.350
entities that are entering the

1679
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:53.430
market place you can't obtain

1680
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:55.560
market they can't can't obtain

1681
01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.980
the all the reliability that

1682
01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.460
they need in the market place so

1683
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.040
again because it's still a

1684
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.980
process I can't tell you in that

1685
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.630
I have an opinion until all the

1686
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:08.570
evidence is in but the

1687
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.390
at sign commissioner tells us

1688
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:12.080
that we should have a decision

1689
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:14.450
by October but I don't a I don't

1690
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:16.680
see that we can we can avoid

1691
01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.150
having some way to fill in those

1692
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.900
weak spots again we there's

1693
01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.320
no one solution for all

1694
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.250
these different business models

1695
01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:27.530
and all these different ways

1696
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:29.320
people are by and technology

1697
01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.270
that everybody will agree on

1698
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:34.750
and so we're trying

1699
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.030
to be as a gnostic as we

1700
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:39.470
can about CCAC the espys

1701
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.350
in direct access about whether

1702
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:43.800
people self generate but we

1703
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.850
know that we have to keep

1704
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:46.430
the great hall and we know

1705
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:49.180
that a large series of large

1706
01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.310
three large central per cures

1707
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:53.670
have made it work that may be

1708
01:27:53.670 --> 01:27:55.230
that what we need to do some

1709
01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:56.950
form of that for everybody

1710
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:58.700
who can't make it work and

1711
01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.970
they're just gonna have to pay

1712
01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.230
thank you any

1713
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:04.210
questions from members

1714
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:06.750
structure thank you

1715
01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.330
Dodd

1716
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:13.620
I'm gonna try to be brief

1717
01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.630
Mister chairman side but this

1718
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:20.200
we are twenty years into

1719
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:22.710
the twenty first century state

1720
01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:24.240
of California is the fifth

1721
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.140
largest economy on the planet

1722
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.170
and we are literally sitting

1723
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.680
here today talking about

1724
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.660
a grid that is

1725
01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:36.130
significantly on reliable

1726
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:38.700
Mr rustler I want to

1727
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.100
ask a little bit about that

1728
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.030
to have eighty percent of the

1729
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:44.520
electricity in the state of

1730
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.040
California managing yes

1731
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:51.740
fifteen thousand to twenty

1732
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.200
thousand megawatts is

1733
01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.010
necessary to rapidly ramp

1734
01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:58.520
up right yes

1735
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.070
and the

1736
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.070
apparently that has grown I

1737
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:06.250
I thought it was somewhere

1738
01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:07.510
around thirteen to fifteen

1739
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.720
free look about in twenty

1740
01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.090
fourteen to start about eight

1741
01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.420
eight thousand megawatts over

1742
01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.510
three hours it's increase now

1743
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.040
to -- about fourteen thousand

1744
01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.220
and you continue you you AB

1745
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.270
characterize your

1746
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:25.050
effort as an automobile

1747
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:28.250
going down a bumpy road changing

1748
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:31.470
four tires and

1749
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:33.950
-- not knowing when or

1750
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:35.200
if the tires would show up

1751
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.300
I would ask you straight

1752
01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.190
out question that

1753
01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.620
analogy seems to me to

1754
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.860
suggest that your task is

1755
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:47.950
if not impossible borderline

1756
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:50.300
impossible I want to ask

1757
01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.440
you your level of confidence

1758
01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.880
that given the sets of

1759
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.610
circumstances that

1760
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.710
we will have an electric

1761
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.840
grid that will not

1762
01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.580
go brown or dark in the near

1763
01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.490
future I have a concern

1764
01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.720
about that and I

1765
01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.390
don't want to miss read your

1766
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:15.700
testimony but it seems to me

1767
01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.010
that there is an undercurrent

1768
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:18.290
in your own testimony that

1769
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:20.640
suggests this is a very very

1770
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.920
difficult challenge to meet

1771
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.060
I am expressing that there

1772
01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.950
is a difficult challenge and

1773
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:28.180
I would like to emphasize

1774
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:29.870
we have met the challenge

1775
01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.420
to this point we have been

1776
01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:32.880
able to operate the grid

1777
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.120
reliably the challenges

1778
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.180
will leave and maintain the

1779
01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.390
right system set a resources

1780
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:42.680
and capabilities to continue

1781
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.080
down the path of a reliable

1782
01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:48.570
operation and I'm feel confident

1783
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.400
that that is possible okay

1784
01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.600
I am hopeful that the

1785
01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:56.430
systems and the processes

1786
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.230
and will be in place that we

1787
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:00.080
will bring the right resource

1788
01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.010
and right resource capability

1789
01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:04.600
to bear to maintain that

1790
01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.930
reliability we look forward

1791
01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:08.950
to continuing to work with

1792
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:10.910
the CPUC in president picker

1793
01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.300
to ensure that the right set

1794
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.720
of resources at the right

1795
01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.430
time in the right location

1796
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.080
are all there to maintain

1797
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.430
this reliability I am not

1798
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.570
suggesting we should shy away

1799
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.430
from the challenge I'm saying

1800
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.940
we have to be thoughtful about

1801
01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.660
meeting that challenge with

1802
01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:33.130
respect dem to reliability

1803
01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.560
is there some kind of a

1804
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.910
definition of what we mean

1805
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.180
by reliability I've been

1806
01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:43.120
here six years I think the

1807
01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.000
reliability that we were

1808
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:48.120
achieving six years ago was

1809
01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.870
a better kind of reliability

1810
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:53.030
than we are achieving presently

1811
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:55.480
I think that affordability

1812
01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.170
is a question of how much

1813
01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.020
and the definition can you

1814
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.040
give us an idea of what the

1815
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.840
definition of reliability

1816
01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.020
is and what the definition

1817
01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.210
of affordability is I think

1818
01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:09.460
that's a longer discussion and

1819
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.990
I have to be able to answer

1820
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.210
in a short period there are

1821
01:32:13.210 --> 01:32:14.790
measurements of reliability

1822
01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:18.040
and they measure from -- howl

1823
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.210
-- north American electric

1824
01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:23.290
reliability -- Burke

1825
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:25.040
basically measures that they

1826
01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.930
measure how we perform to meet

1827
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:28.810
that reliability you can also

1828
01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:31.320
measure reliability in terms of

1829
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:35.440
the probability of loss low

1830
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:37.080
is -- probability of losing

1831
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.910
also and this is this is

1832
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:40.400
used by the commission to

1833
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.210
ensure that that loss of low

1834
01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.090
probability is maintained

1835
01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.170
above a certain threshold and

1836
01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:47.980
ensure that those resources

1837
01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:50.080
meet that level reliability

1838
01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.990
you suggested that the

1839
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:56.670
electrons that keep our

1840
01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:59.410
grid balanced often are

1841
01:32:59.410 --> 01:33:01.950
from the ghastly -- and

1842
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:05.720
-- oftentimes from -- imports

1843
01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:09.190
and you talk about a date

1844
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:10.310
February eighteenth sometime

1845
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:12.030
back he gave me a report that

1846
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:14.210
to be my birthday in which

1847
01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:15.640
the balancing act was on kind

1848
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.750
of a nice edge again of this

1849
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:18.100
thirteen to fifteen thousand

1850
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.290
dollar ramp up fifteen thousand

1851
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:22.620
megawatt ramp up very very

1852
01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.820
quickly when fifteen thousand

1853
01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.840
make a lot of demand was

1854
01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.940
coming on line and the like

1855
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:32.140
it seems to me that we have

1856
01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.760
been managing this grit

1857
01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.760
reliability with the kind of

1858
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.530
electrons that some in this

1859
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.490
California legis lecture

1860
01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:44.930
would like to see us eliminate

1861
01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.920
and I have a

1862
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.790
a concern over what amounts

1863
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:54.220
to morally acceptable

1864
01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:57.450
electrons an immoral electrons

1865
01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.730
and your aye if I'm hearing

1866
01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:02.430
you correctly it is the

1867
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:05.600
-- less than favored electrons

1868
01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.000
that have kept us balanced

1869
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.160
and yet we continue to

1870
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.320
try and push and move farther

1871
01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.530
and farther away from the

1872
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.060
very kinds of electrons that

1873
01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.130
have been available from sources

1874
01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:20.670
that keep us balanced but

1875
01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:21.730
they're not the sources that are

1876
01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:24.290
favorable I think that

1877
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:26.900
if the fines a reliability

1878
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:29.460
problems as we move

1879
01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:32.090
off of the the gas fleet

1880
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:36.370
what we places the reliability

1881
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:39.890
that right now you are being

1882
01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.220
we're relying on that correct

1883
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.020
so February eighteenth I noticed

1884
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.090
that that day -- we run a

1885
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:47.770
nice edge and it was imports

1886
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:49.490
natural gas and other forms of

1887
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:51.430
electricity and electrons that

1888
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:53.130
we are trying I guess our dead

1889
01:34:53.130 --> 01:34:55.510
level best to eliminate so I

1890
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.160
I again I I I I still

1891
01:34:58.210 --> 01:35:01.050
have an on easy feeling

1892
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:03.270
about the reliability as

1893
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:05.490
we move forward can I get

1894
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.210
the feeling that you are hopeful

1895
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.120
and optimistic but that is

1896
01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.380
aspirational the reality of

1897
01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.290
the grid is that it is physics

1898
01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.020
and I sometimes wonder if

1899
01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.370
the aspirations are warring

1900
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:19.070
with the physics of electrons

1901
01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.580
thank you I'll just say it

1902
01:35:21.630 --> 01:35:23.670
to my point is that's why I

1903
01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:25.630
mentioned that we have to be

1904
01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:27.420
careful about not letting these

1905
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.520
resources go that we rely upon

1906
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.060
the reliability until we have

1907
01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.730
no and are secure in knowing

1908
01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:36.950
that those replacements

1909
01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.350
provide all the reliability

1910
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:40.490
needs that we will need

1911
01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:41.930
and that is the channel

1912
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:46.350
with any other

1913
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:48.000
questions the quirk

1914
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.590
so

1915
01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.410
first of all obviously this

1916
01:35:56.410 --> 01:35:57.750
is a very difficult problem

1917
01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:00.110
it's a lot easier our

1918
01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:03.400
with integrated our providers

1919
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:04.380
particularly if they can be

1920
01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:05.650
just three of them they have

1921
01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:08.380
lots of capital it cetera so

1922
01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:10.050
we're definitely in a place

1923
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:11.770
where we don't know what

1924
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:13.730
to do next certainly for

1925
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:15.990
something like serving a week

1926
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:19.560
where the sun isn't shining and

1927
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:21.350
we don't have a terribly large

1928
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:23.760
amount of wind either -- we're

1929
01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.890
going to have to have storage

1930
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:29.070
and that's multi billion dollars

1931
01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.750
and -- the cheapest type

1932
01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.260
is a course pump solar and

1933
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.890
it's not clear how you get and

1934
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.370
you've actually stated this

1935
01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:41.590
is not clear how you get these

1936
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:43.570
many different small agencies

1937
01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:45.380
to get together to purchase

1938
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.800
that and that is certainly

1939
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.260
something that we like to do

1940
01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.200
-- and you really have a dress

1941
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.450
this and you said there really

1942
01:36:52.450 --> 01:36:54.050
isn't a solution right now I'm

1943
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:56.660
hoping when the CCA's in other

1944
01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.080
load serving entities come

1945
01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.850
up they'll give us some ideas

1946
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.710
but I think it's important to

1947
01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:05.580
stress that we have reliability

1948
01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:06.890
now but to have it in the

1949
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.530
future for going to more --

1950
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.280
renewables we're going to need

1951
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.110
to make major purchases and it's

1952
01:37:13.110 --> 01:37:15.660
not clear who has the credit

1953
01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:19.080
and the ability to do this so

1954
01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.220
but again you haven't told me

1955
01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:23.000
there's a solution so there's

1956
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.130
one other thing I'm worried

1957
01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:27.040
about P. Jeannie went bankrupt

1958
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:30.060
not because of particular

1959
01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.320
claims from fires but because

1960
01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:36.090
their credit rating when to

1961
01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:37.900
junk bond status at which point

1962
01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.340
they couldn't borrow money

1963
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:43.000
and further their providers

1964
01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:45.890
of electricity were insisting

1965
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:47.960
that they pay cash up front

1966
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:50.150
-- or at least have cash in

1967
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:51.350
the bank to show that they

1968
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:53.680
could buy the energy this is

1969
01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.880
about to happen to southern

1970
01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.810
California Edison it's now one

1971
01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:00.460
click above --

1972
01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.920
-- junk bond status

1973
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.280
if they go to that status

1974
01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.410
still be out in a couple

1975
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:09.180
of weeks even though again

1976
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:12.550
date date we don't see a threat

1977
01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.210
right now to them not being

1978
01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:15.670
able to pay off these but

1979
01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:17.120
none the less it is happening

1980
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.490
the P. you see has tools

1981
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:22.660
which it has used for example

1982
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.030
during the -- San Bruno

1983
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:27.810
-- gas explosion to say

1984
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.320
alright rate payers will pay

1985
01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.060
for such and such and will

1986
01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:33.590
guaranteed that de

1987
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:38.200
stability of fee utility

1988
01:38:38.230 --> 01:38:40.910
-- to continue to do business

1989
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:43.280
without having to go into

1990
01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.900
bankruptcy to get -- a

1991
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.720
debtor financing up do you

1992
01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.730
do you see Mr picker

1993
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.500
a way to help --

1994
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.210
southern California Edison over

1995
01:38:56.210 --> 01:38:58.230
the next month or so well this

1996
01:38:58.230 --> 01:38:59.830
thread hangs over their head

1997
01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.230
so having had lots

1998
01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:06.630
of conversations through

1999
01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.500
our financial adviser with

2000
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.620
capital markets I'm not sure

2001
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.160
that there is anything we can

2002
01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.170
do legally that will satisfy

2003
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:16.700
them they are looking for

2004
01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.890
first and foremost changes in

2005
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:21.910
states inverse condemnation --

2006
01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:24.400
definition they would like to

2007
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.270
have a way not just to know what

2008
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.910
the eventual will rate

2009
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:32.450
payer contribution will be for

2010
01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.510
-- utility costs of wildfire

2011
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:38.380
recovery and victim compensation

2012
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:40.670
but they want to know it soon

2013
01:39:40.670 --> 01:39:41.800
they want to know it right

2014
01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.600
away that's very difficult to

2015
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.720
do because the statute that

2016
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.470
the legislature adopted in the

2017
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:49.240
governor signed SB nine a one

2018
01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.930
requires that the utility come

2019
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:52.490
forward with an application

2020
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:54.460
that specify the cost there

2021
01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.240
won't be known right away so

2022
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:59.280
there's a lack of confidence

2023
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.010
in any of the tools that

2024
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:02.700
are available to us so we're

2025
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.420
struggling with this along with

2026
01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.830
the governor's office in his

2027
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:08.930
strike force to find a solution

2028
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:11.340
that both protects rate payers

2029
01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.440
insurers reliability of our

2030
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.430
electric supply and ensures

2031
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:17.600
that like that there's a a fund

2032
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.330
it'll compensate those victims

2033
01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.170
who were who are entitled to

2034
01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:23.990
payment by the utilities and

2035
01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:25.700
they make their utilities

2036
01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:27.720
investable but I think that

2037
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.450
that so far nothing that that

2038
01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:32.690
we have put into statute or

2039
01:40:32.690 --> 01:40:34.530
in to regulation is going to

2040
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:36.820
satisfy the rating agencies

2041
01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:39.630
okay so just one more problem

2042
01:40:39.970 --> 01:40:41.630
down the road all right

2043
01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:42.900

can preset the opportunity to

2075
01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:45.960
be here today to talk about a

2076
01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.590
very important issue reliability

2077
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:50.350
like lead off by noting that

2078
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.450
SB one hundred -- was a very

2079
01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:54.570
proud culmination of a long

2080
01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:55.830
history of California energy

2081
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:57.830
bills of that will now be a

2082
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:59.100
seek to provide a higher percent

2083
01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.490
clean energy in California by

2084
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:02.540
twenty forty five and its C.

2085
01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.640
fully supports this objective

2086
01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.440
however if you've heard in the

2087
01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.860
earlier panel we must do so

2088
01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:09.310
in a manner that ensures the

2089
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:11.020
lectures city is reliable and

2090
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.930
affordable to all Californians

2091
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.940
if we fail to make reliability

2092
01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.220
and affordability our priority

2093
01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:19.050
we will fail in achieving our

2094
01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:20.090
clean energy goals and we'll

2095
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.370
certainly fill California

2096
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:23.680
in order to succeed we have

2097
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.040
to carefully plan our energy

2098
01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.820
future and we have to make sure

2099
01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.140
that all those serving at ease

2100
01:42:28.170 --> 01:42:30.530
CCA's energy service providers

2101
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.790
I -- use PO use have equal

2102
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:34.330
responsibilities and achieving

2103
01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:36.580
our goals may briefly touch

2104
01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:38.620
on reliability clean energy and

2105
01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.030
market operations in the context

2106
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.040
of the ongoing fragmentation

2107
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:44.480
of our load serving at ease

2108
01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.980
in doing so I want to fully

2109
01:42:47.010 --> 01:42:48.890
-- underscore that has and

2110
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:50.470
does support customer choice

2111
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.970
we support who they get their

2112
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:53.690
electricity from in technology

2113
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:55.270
that they -- they deploy

2114
01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:57.140
but we must balance customer

2115
01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.220
choice -- with a very rigorous

2116
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.760
planning an accountability

2117
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.150
framework to ensure that all

2118
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:04.690
load serving eighties of or

2119
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:06.770
able to -- fairly meet their

2120
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:08.280
-- the requirements are clean

2121
01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.620
power goals so beginning with

2122
01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:12.780
reliability a California has a

2123
01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.410
resource adequacy framework that

2124
01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:15.900
requires the jealousy to procure

2125
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.790
it's pro rated share of system

2126
01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:19.640
local Arian and flexibility

2127
01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.970
resources need to ensure

2128
01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:22.980
reliable electric system and

2129
01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:24.310
because our our a requirements

2130
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:25.980
have been imposed on a year had

2131
01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:28.410
a month ahead basis resource

2132
01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:29.680
adequacy is really only

2133
01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.740
procuring existing resources

2134
01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:34.090
it's not procuring new resources

2135
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:36.050
the way we secure new resources

2136
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:38.140
in the past is we've -- through

2137
01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.910
the CPC's long term procurement

2138
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:42.450
plan process more recently

2139
01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:43.890
the IRP process integrated

2140
01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:45.780
resource plan process that water

2141
01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:46.940
the investor owned utilities

2142
01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:49.130
to develop the needed resources

2143
01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.540
are to ensure that there's

2144
01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:52.470
enough electrical capacity

2145
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:54.600
on the system the the -- use

2146
01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:55.500
have their own system they

2147
01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:56.520
have their integrated resource

2148
01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.020
plans and and and through their

2149
01:43:58.020 --> 01:43:59.210
own boards state make sure

2150
01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:00.930
they have sufficient resources

2151
01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:03.630
our resource that I was the

2152
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:06.230
program has worked well to date

2153
01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:08.240
of because when we first started

2154
01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.520
there were three investor owned

2155
01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.120
utilities and about a dozen

2156
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.840
years peas and investor owned

2157
01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.040
utilities procured eighty five

2158
01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.200
percent of everything that need

2159
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.840
to be purchased and because we

2160
01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.220
understand our system so well

2161
01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.460
we made sure we purchased the

2162
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:20.710
things that were needed to keep

2163
01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:22.460
the crab reliable and we could

2164
01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:23.970
afford to pay a premium for that

2165
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.380
because we could socialize that

2166
01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:27.060
premium across all customers

2167
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:30.640
today arm the investor owned

2168
01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.840
utilities are gonna be serving

2169
01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.050
less than half their load of

2170
01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.850
we have is many is a fifty

2171
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:38.210
low serving eighties coming into

2172
01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:40.050
existence by twenty twenty one

2173
01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.540
and the we're not no longer

2174
01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.180
able to go out and secured those

2175
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.890
expensive resources because we'd

2176
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:47.280
be disadvantaging the customers

2177
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.390
that stay with us so what we

2178
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:49.530
do is we go out the care the

2179
01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:50.950
resources that technically meet

2180
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:52.670
the requirements but that make

2181
01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:55.260
up this cold but in in in --

2182
01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.800
in a collective sense do not

2183
01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.170
fully meet the requirements

2184
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:59.950
and then the cal I SO has to

2185
01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:01.410
backstop those resources that

2186
01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:02.770
leads to very expensive double

2187
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:04.560
procurement so we need to

2188
01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.770
come up with a better system

2189
01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.220
than having each Los serving

2190
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:08.620
ID trying to buy the lowest

2191
01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.220
cost resource that technically

2192
01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.410
meets the requirement even if

2193
01:45:11.410 --> 01:45:13.330
it's not fully effective in in

2194
01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:14.750
meeting the reliability mandate

2195
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.570
the other challenge that we

2196
01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:22.690
have in our resource adequacy

2197
01:45:22.690 --> 01:45:24.460
program is that we do have some

2198
01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.650
large generators -- that make it

2199
01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:28.280
very difficult for smaller loads

2200
01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.850
serving entities to purchase

2201
01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.720
present picker the CPC briefly

2202
01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:33.310
touch on this but just to put

2203
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:35.430
it into context we have some

2204
01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.490
some generators that their size

2205
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:39.130
is greater than the load of

2206
01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.790
some of the smaller ESP isn't

2207
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:43.160
CCS and if we have to procure

2208
01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.690
that specific facility who is

2209
01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:46.570
going to do it -- if you were

2210
01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:47.840
running your house you would not

2211
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.140
appreciate it if forty people

2212
01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.410
showed up and sub all rent your

2213
01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:52.110
kitchen all right your bathroom

2214
01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:53.560
all right your garage alright

2215
01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.160
your attic you want somebody

2216
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.880
to rent your whole house and

2217
01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.650
so we got to come up with a

2218
01:45:57.650 --> 01:45:59.480
mechanism that will enable

2219
01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.720
these larger facilities that

2220
01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.310
are needed for reliability to

2221
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:03.920
be cared by a large collection

2222
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.370
of of load serving at ease

2223
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:06.670
so we think two things are

2224
01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:08.600
necessary to get there the

2225
01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.640
first is we do think that

2226
01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.140
central buyer framework should

2227
01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:12.840
be adopted for local resource

2228
01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:14.850
adequacy and recognition that

2229
01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:16.190
these transmission constrained

2230
01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:18.340
areas have either very limited

2231
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:19.470
resources to procure that

2232
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:20.910
you can't allocate to forty

2233
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:22.570
different entities or they

2234
01:46:22.570 --> 01:46:23.910
have very large generators

2235
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.040
that you can't allocate the

2236
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.260
forty different generators

2237
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.980
we also believe that the I'll

2238
01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:30.920
use who are the reliability

2239
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.730
custodians of our grads should

2240
01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:33.940
be the ones designated to be

2241
01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:36.270
the central buyers and that they

2242
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:37.830
would procure those resources

2243
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:39.110
and allocate the net cost

2244
01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:40.800
the net benefits to all those

2245
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.410
serving entities through the

2246
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:44.450
legislature's and the CPC's cost

2247
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:45.920
allocation mechanism it's called

2248
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.500
the cam it exists and we've

2249
01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:48.550
already developed thousands of

2250
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:50.210
megawatts through this process

2251
01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:52.070
so from medicines perspective

2252
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.970
we don't think we need to

2253
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:54.590
revisit how did you central

2254
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:55.930
procurement it already exists

2255
01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.490
you just need to instruct the

2256
01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:59.440
CBC or the CPC needs to adopt

2257
01:46:59.690 --> 01:47:00.890
the utilities as the central

2258
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:03.070
buyers in doing this I want to

2259
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:04.220
be real clear on something the

2260
01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:05.710
utilities don't make a profit

2261
01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:06.820
and reselling power we're

2262
01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.560
not allowed to by law we pass

2263
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.200
these costs through as their

2264
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.960
incurred we may actually lose

2265
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.640
money the CPC says that we did

2266
01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.410
something inappropriate but we

2267
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:16.630
don't big money the reseller

2268
01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:18.200
purchase power so this would be

2269
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.720
strictly reliability function

2270
01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.710
that would enable the multitude

2271
01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:22.720
of Los serving eighties that

2272
01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.340
are on the system to still do

2273
01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:26.020
what they can do but maintain

2274
01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.430
reliability which is got to

2275
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:29.610
be our mission number one

2276
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:33.380
a second to ensure that we

2277
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:34.860
timely build the needed new

2278
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:36.440
resources in a way that can

2279
01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.260
be -- the can be allocated

2280
01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:39.740
to all although Cervantes

2281
01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.340
the CPC needs to be given the

2282
01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.550
ability to help procurement

2283
01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:45.220
-- enforcement authority on

2284
01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:46.950
all the jurisdictional low

2285
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:48.920
that it regulates today the

2286
01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.900
integrated resource planning

2287
01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:52.790
process the only -- can impose

2288
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:54.010
procurement requirements on the

2289
01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.660
utilities and energy service

2290
01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.990
providers and CCA's submit

2291
01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.330
our peace the CPC are but

2292
01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.240
they will not -- necessarily

2293
01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.970
be held accountable to perform

2294
01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.400
relative to those are peas they

2295
01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.860
can decide to procure something

2296
01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:11.310
different -- and that puts the

2297
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:12.950
state's reliability at rest

2298
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:14.710
because if we thought somebody

2299
01:48:14.710 --> 01:48:15.510
was going to do something

2300
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:16.260
then they did something

2301
01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.630
different there there could

2302
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:19.280
be an unintended consequence

2303
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.990
up to changing gears your

2304
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:25.610
quickly on renewables report

2305
01:48:25.610 --> 01:48:26.490
had a great discussion on

2306
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:27.440
renewable so I'm not gonna

2307
01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.510
repeat -- much of that I do

2308
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:31.720
want to identify that the state

2309
01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.890
California's relied on three

2310
01:48:32.890 --> 01:48:34.230
investor owned utilities to

2311
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:35.590
develop the largest renewable

2312
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:36.770
flea and the state in the

2313
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:39.180
country skews me -- between

2314
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.860
three utilities were projected

2315
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.170
to be delivering over fifty

2316
01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:44.150
thousand gigawatt hours are in

2317
01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:45.460
a one or two starting in twenty

2318
01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.260
twenty one already basically

2319
01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.200
there now of which more than

2320
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.600
meets the utilities -- our PS

2321
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.820
requirements in contrast the

2322
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.490
CCA's and use peas are have

2323
01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.290
through the reporting to the CPC

2324
01:48:58.290 --> 01:49:00.370
indicated that they cared about

2325
01:49:00.370 --> 01:49:02.220
a third of their actual our PS

2326
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.050
requirements -- if effective

2327
01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:05.810
twenty twenty one no I'm sure

2328
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:07.190
this is a start up issue because

2329
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:08.520
a lot of these low serving as

2330
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.570
have just begun operation up

2331
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:12.340
but twenty twenty one is a very

2332
01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.410
important date right because

2333
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:15.500
under -- SB three fifteen SB one

2334
01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:17.540
hundred two thirds of our our PS

2335
01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:19.620
has to be long term and so the

2336
01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.240
resources have been procured yet

2337
01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:22.830
they can't deliver and twenty

2338
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:24.020
twenty one so we want to make

2339
01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.130
sure of that there's appropriate

2340
01:49:26.130 --> 01:49:28.150
oversight of the CCA's needs

2341
01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:29.490
peace making sure that they are

2342
01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:31.250
procuring a in a timely manner

2343
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:33.380
the necessary renewal resources

2344
01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.580
to allow the grid to operate

2345
01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:37.090
both reliably and to meet our

2346
01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:38.880
carbon goals we think the CPC

2347
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.030
should have more oversight

2348
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:41.970
and and and check and forty

2349
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.370
enforcement authority to make

2350
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:45.370
sure that the -- -- that those

2351
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.650
are PS schools being met in a

2352
01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:48.390
timely manner what we consider

2353
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:50.170
whether the the vote serving ID

2354
01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:51.560
is in a position to circle out

2355
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:54.410
of final issue I want to

2356
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:55.880
touch on here's affordability

2357
01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.410
efficient market operations

2358
01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.520
the investor owned utilities

2359
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:02.020
are required to bid all of the

2360
01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:03.250
resources that control into the

2361
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:05.690
market cost again we don't

2362
01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:06.780
make any money at this we built

2363
01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.650
it because when we control when

2364
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:10.230
we served eighty five percent

2365
01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:11.920
load that meant that the market

2366
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.750
generally cleared at cost that

2367
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:14.960
was a really good outcome for

2368
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.500
customers now that we're going

2369
01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.970
to have about fifty load serving

2370
01:50:17.970 --> 01:50:20.170
entities and utilities are

2371
01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:21.390
serving less than half the load

2372
01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.770
none of those other entities

2373
01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.340
have a cost based procure

2374
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.630
-- bidding mandate they will

2375
01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:28.800
logically think about what you

2376
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.170
would do yourself they will seek

2377
01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:31.720
to maximize the revenues for

2378
01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.180
their resources so we have an E.

2379
01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:35.150
S. P. or CCA that has a critical

2380
01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:36.920
energy storage project and their

2381
01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.240
bidding in the market but I

2382
01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.300
could say I just want to cover

2383
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.940
my costs bigger say how can I

2384
01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.660
maximize the revenue for that

2385
01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:44.720
second reduce the cost for my

2386
01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.440
customers of so if if we have

2387
01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.090
a multitude of entities bidding

2388
01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.810
yeah I profit maximizing mode

2389
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.680
which is how markets operate

2390
01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.060
not saying that's not not how

2391
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:56.220
market should operate we are

2392
01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:57.360
going to increase the cost

2393
01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.810
of power to all customers in

2394
01:50:58.810 --> 01:51:00.460
California and we make literacy

2395
01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.920
less affordable than it is today

2396
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:04.230
SB very difficult to electrify

2397
01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:06.290
of the the transportation and

2398
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:07.440
building sectors that it's

2399
01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:09.230
going to be incumbent upon us

2400
01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:10.400
to do we want to hit our carbon

2401
01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.010
goals -- and we're certainly

2402
01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:12.910
going to make it difficult

2403
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:14.700
for low income customers to

2404
01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:16.990
out to pay their bills so

2405
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:19.650
with with those concerns just

2406
01:51:19.650 --> 01:51:20.900
want to remind the committee

2407
01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.130
here that the electric grid is a

2408
01:51:22.130 --> 01:51:24.180
very complex operation that must

2409
01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:25.820
be very well managed I in order

2410
01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.600
to -- to operate it requires

2411
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.560
perfect balancing is Mister ruff

2412
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.180
leader from cal I SO discussed

2413
01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.420
and the cheating our first

2414
01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:34.660
that fifty percent renewable

2415
01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.090
goal is gonna be considered

2416
01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:37.970
relatively easy to getting

2417
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:39.480
the last fifty percent clean

2418
01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.160
so many things need to happen

2419
01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.080
on the grid to get the last

2420
01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.580
fifty percent clean we have to

2421
01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:45.770
have a coordinated centralized

2422
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:47.150
planning process and we need to

2423
01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:49.120
make sure the CPC can enforce

2424
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.150
procurement requirements on

2425
01:51:50.150 --> 01:51:51.810
although serving ID's and to the

2426
01:51:51.810 --> 01:51:53.550
extent that those requirements

2427
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:55.070
are not readily assignable

2428
01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.880
because it's one project word

2429
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.110
something very complicated that

2430
01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.450
can't be given out to fifty

2431
01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:01.090
people then we need to look to

2432
01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:02.170
the utilities to the central

2433
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:03.410
buyers for those projects with

2434
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:04.960
appropriate cost allocation

2435
01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:06.860
and a benefit allocation

2436
01:52:07.710 --> 01:52:09.280
central planning social equity

2437
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.420
and reliability objectives

2438
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.990
need to take the priority over

2439
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:13.400
individual Ellis E. procurement

2440
01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.400
preferences and with that I'd

2441
01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.660
appreciate your time here today

2442
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:23.970
thank you appreciate that

2443
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.400
-- except Scott Russia

2444
01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:33.060
hi good afternoon and --

2445
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:34.410
thank you very much for the

2446
01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:36.180
opportunity to come and --

2447
01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:39.110
represent Kelso and a sharp

2448
01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:40.010
perspectives on the role

2449
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:41.060
that distributed energy

2450
01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:42.780
resources could play in

2451
01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:43.880
ensuring reliability and

2452
01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.400
and and affordability --

2453
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.070
I have three key points I'd

2454
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:50.780
like to make up first DVRs

2455
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.150
can and do contribute to

2456
01:52:52.150 --> 01:52:54.270
reliability today I'll talk

2457
01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:56.660
about that more -- second

2458
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.560
they can do a lot more and

2459
01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.390
so I'll be I'll be happy to

2460
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:02.110
operate on the ways that the

2461
01:53:02.110 --> 01:53:04.110
commission the I SO in the

2462

to affordability by providing

2465
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:11.820
savings to customers today

2466
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:12.740

01:54:15.330 --> 01:54:17.400
entities that's just beginning

2498
01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.480
to scratch the surface it's

2499
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.800
still a relatively young

2500
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.850
market but in addition to

2501
01:54:21.850 --> 01:54:23.890
that supply side the are where

2502
01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:26.470
the demand response resources

2503
01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:28.180
participate directly in those

2504
01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:29.970
markets distributor resources

2505
01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:31.380
also contribute substantially

2506
01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.200
to reliability by reducing

2507
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.050
peak loads and reducing

2508
01:54:35.050 --> 01:54:37.700
peak loads -- Ellis sees

2509
01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:40.740
are a obligation is reduced in

2510
01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:41.870
the future because it's that

2511
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:44.280
peak load that sets each are

2512
01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.890
a our obligation for each LSE

2513
01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:49.830
one obvious example of that

2514
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:51.560
is that we used to have peak

2515
01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:53.760
loads in the mid day -- to you

2516
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.780
you rates had peak rates from

2517
01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:56.860
twelve to six or eleven to

2518
01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:58.830
six because that was the peak

2519
01:54:58.830 --> 01:55:01.060
load and as you well know with

2520
01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.440
the dot curve because of the

2521
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:05.050
abundance of solar energy solar

2522
01:55:05.050 --> 01:55:07.300
energy has substantially changed

2523
01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.710
that and push that peak back

2524
01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.310
but for several years there

2525
01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.150
a solar energy was contributing

2526
01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:14.620
drug directly to reducing

2527
01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:17.050
the then current peak --

2528
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.350
so now that's just a quick

2529
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:20.720
overview of how de ours are

2530
01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.260
contributing to the liability

2531
01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.260
today we think the ours can

2532
01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:26.870
do much much more we're close

2533
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:29.010
to hitting the original goal of

2534
01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:30.350
the California solar initiative

2535
01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:31.710
-- you may remember it was

2536
01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:32.860
originally called the million

2537
01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:34.110
solar roofs initiative skis

2538
01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:36.670
me would you define D. E. R.

2539
01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.540
a distributed energy resources

2540
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
thank you for

2541
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:47.440
we are project that California

2542
01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.850
will literally had one million

2543
01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:49.800
so every sometime in the

2544
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.990
next few months were at over

2545
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.040
nine hundred thousand now

2546
01:55:53.050 --> 01:55:54.570
-- that's a that's a big

2547
01:55:54.570 --> 01:55:55.390
deal and that's a lot of

2548
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:58.280
energy being produced I think

2549
01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:00.560
-- mark cross leader said six

2550
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:02.670
gigawatts of installed by --

2551
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:03.860
behind the meter or customers

2552
01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:05.590
I to capacity that's actually

2553
01:56:05.590 --> 01:56:06.400
a little bit out of date

2554
01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.270
looking at the most recent

2555
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:08.680
numbers it's as well over seven

2556
01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:10.320
give gigawatts of capacity

2557
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.150
that's easy to think that energy

2558
01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:14.660
storage is a relatively mature

2559
01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.830
industry as well it has been

2560
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:17.530
around for a few years the

2561
01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:19.170
soft generations and of program

2562
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:21.240
has been funding storage since

2563
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.340
two thousand nine and we hear

2564
01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.140
a lot about storage with a

2565
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.810
big name companies like Tesla

2566
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:29.370
often in the headlines but

2567
01:56:29.410 --> 01:56:30.490
compared to the nearly eight

2568
01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:31.970
thousand megawatts of rooftop

2569
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:33.420
solar installed in California

2570
01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:35.350
we have only a little over a

2571
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:36.620
hundred megawatts of installed

2572
01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:39.050
stored under the está program

2573
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.960
there's another two hundred

2574
01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.370
plus Michael what's in the

2575
01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:44.080
pipeline though so relative

2576
01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:45.840
to the dot curve it's still

2577
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.120
a relatively small amount --

2578
01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.080
I want to personally thank

2579
01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:52.770
you the legislature for passing

2580
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:54.000
Senate bill seven hundred last

2581
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.820
year -- that will extend the

2582
01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:57.040
está program for other five

2583
01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.870
years we estimate that -- that

2584
01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:01.020
program in the extension of

2585
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.710
the program and that the funds

2586
01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:04.870
on least could contribute to

2587
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:05.990
the installation of another

2588
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:07.340
two thousand plus megawatts

2589
01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:08.660
of customer cited storage over

2590
01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:10.350
the next several years that's

2591
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:11.380
enough to make a considerable

2592
01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:12.550
down and the dot curve

2593
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:16.330
as to help to grow the base

2594
01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:18.140
it incentivize customers to

2595
01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.080
install -- customer cited

2596
01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:21.890
storage and their other programs

2597
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:23.940
incentivizing other load

01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.540
modifying resources smart home

2599

energy management automated

2600
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:28.610
demand response but there are

2601
01:57:28.610 --> 01:57:30.110
significant barriers that stand

2602
01:57:30.110 --> 01:57:32.170
in the way of really allowing

2603
01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:34.000
D. E. ours to provide the full

2604
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.990
value to the grid both for

2605
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:37.650
reliability and for reducing

2606
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:39.540
other utility infrastructure

2607
01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.950
needs counsel just released

2608
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:43.600
a report on some of the key

2609
01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.860
barriers that we see that came

2610
01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:46.100
out at the end of January you

2611
01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:47.960
can find that easily on our

2612
01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:50.150
website at Kelso dot org C. A.

2613
01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:52.430
L. S. S. A. dot org I'll talk

2614
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:53.960
about a couple of those report

2615
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.940
five years from the report

2616
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:59.350
one is that under

2617
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:01.220
the cuts those demand response

2618
01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:04.100
programs the customer side

2619
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.810
of resources are not allowed to

2620
01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:08.010
export beyond the customer meter

2621
01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:09.760
to the grid and count towards

2622
01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.270
a demand response event to

2623
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:13.480
count their capacity this is

2624
01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.740
a significant handicap this

2625
01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:18.130
means that if you have storage

2626
01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.900
and the amount of stores that

2627
01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.410
you have on site at any point

2628
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:24.020
exceeds your minimum load and

2629
01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:26.150
the chi so needs that energy and

2630
01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:27.870
needs that capacity you can't

2631
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:29.200
get the full amount you have to

2632
01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.380
stop at the point where you're

2633
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:32.780
the discharge your battery

2634
01:58:33.250 --> 01:58:35.490
only meets the onsite load this

2635
01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:37.520
is a a huge barrier that we

2636
01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.370
think just needlessly handicaps

2637
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:40.890
the ability of distributed

2638
01:58:40.890 --> 01:58:42.900
resources to contribute to the

2639
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:44.300
cut some marketing contribute to

2640
01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:47.030
reliability the others look

2641
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:48.840
at mark arcane I won't I won't

2642
01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:50.310
dwell on it very much but it's

2643
01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.440
what is the relationship to

2644
01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:53.650
particularly customer cited

2645
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:56.160
resources that the utilities

2646
01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.930
might need for local are a or

2647
01:58:57.930 --> 01:59:00.040
to avoid a distribution or

2648
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.580
transmission about spent and

2649
01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:02.840
what's already in the forecast

2650
01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.000
because all of these needs are

2651
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.680
driven by their forecast what

2652
01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.190
they expect to occur in the

2653
01:59:07.190 --> 01:59:08.460
next few years with respect

2654
01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.630
to load and unload shape and

2655
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:11.960
in that forecast you have some

2656
01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:14.980
DVRs this is a a pretty tricky

2657
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:17.360
problem because it any better

2658
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.820
at to a solicitation have

2659
01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:20.710
to somehow differentiate the

2660
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:21.920
capacity they're offering from

2661
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.760
what's in the forecast but I

2662
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.450
want to let you know that just

2663
01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:26.960
over the last couple of days --

2664
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.010
Monday and Tuesday the PC had

2665
01:59:29.010 --> 01:59:30.210
some very productive workshops

2666
01:59:30.210 --> 01:59:31.600
on on this and other topics

2667
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.880
related to the use of DVRs to

2668
01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:35.270
provide distribution value and

2669
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:36.590
I think that there is a path

2670
01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:39.200
forward with the elimination

2671
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.920
of those to be two barriers

2672
01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:42.670
I think -- you could see that

2673
01:59:43.130 --> 01:59:44.450
substantial more participation

2674
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:46.170
of distributed energy resources

2675
01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.760
I'm contributing to reliability

2676
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:50.420
and savings that's a good segue

2677
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:51.330
because I want to talk about

2678
01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:53.590
savings -- Howard the ours

2679
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:54.860
contributing to affordability

2680
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:57.590
the industry has long argued

2681
01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:59.240
that investment and rooftop

2682
01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:01.940
solar -- will help save

2683
02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.750
customers money through

2684
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:04.040
the avoidance of utility

2685
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:05.890
infrastructure we just didn't

2686
02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:07.940
have much concrete evidence in

2687
02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.540
twenty sixteen the chi so in

2688
02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.800
its transition planning report

2689
02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.950
announced the cancellation of

2690
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:12.920
a hundred ninety two million

2691
02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.830
dollars of transition projects

2692
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:16.890
and the P. Ginny territory and

2693
02:00:16.890 --> 02:00:18.300
that the to do that largely

2694
02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:20.140
due to lower revised demand

2695
02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:22.610
for cast because of distributed

2696
02:00:22.610 --> 02:00:23.890
solar energy efficiency

2697
02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:25.870
and other resources so I

2698
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:26.810
was one of the first really

2699
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:28.320
concrete examples of savings

2700
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:30.360
obtained by the pointy ours

2701
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.290
that was exciting then in

2702
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:35.120
twenty eighteen the Kaiser

2703
02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.270
released another transition

2704
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:37.870
planning report which provided

2705
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:39.520
even better news the cuts

2706
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.920
announced it was rescinding

2707
02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.270
approval of projects worth

2708
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:43.960
more than thirteen times the

2709
02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.990
savings from twenty sixteen two

2710
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:47.260
point six billion dollars of

2711
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:48.800
cancel transmission projects

2712
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:51.850
-- this is to us game

2713
02:00:51.850 --> 02:00:54.190
changer it shows that the

2714
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:56.470
harm that promise that we had

2715
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:58.730
long held out of savings for

2716
02:00:58.730 --> 02:01:00.660
customers other than just those

2717
02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:02.070
who actually adopt rooftop solar

2718
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:03.510
who dot storage themselves but

2719
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:05.580
other customers can be realized

2720
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:08.230
the same report also described a

2721
02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:09.520
project called the Oakland clean

2722
02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:11.620
energy initiative this the need

2723
02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.930
for this project was triggered

2724
02:01:12.930 --> 02:01:15.020
by the retirement of an aging --

2725
02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:17.160
power plant in the very heart of

2726
02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.870
Oakland your Jack London square

2727
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:21.860
and this plant was essential

2728
02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:22.990
to maintaining reliability in

2729
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:25.590
the area the cut so estimated

2730
02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:27.660
that the cost of building a

2731
02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.450
new transmission line because

2732
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:31.030
nobody wanted a new gas fired

2733
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.990
plant in the area Oakland --

2734
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:34.720
as you can imagine strenuously

2735
02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:37.010
opposed was something on the

2736
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:38.030
order of three hundred and

2737
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:39.560
sixty million dollars just

2738
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.410
for this one transmission

2739
02:01:40.410 --> 02:01:42.240
line but in that transition

2740
02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.790
report the guy so estimated

2741
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:44.910
that a distributed resource

2742
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:46.500
solution of resources in the

2743
02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:48.310
area would cost a fraction of

2744
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:49.830
that probably at most somewhere

2745
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:51.210
around a hundred million dollars

2746
02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:53.220
so another two hundred sixty

2747
02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.020
million dollars of savings by

2748
02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.480
using distributed resources to

2749
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.180
avoid -- traditional

2750
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:01.810
utility infrastructure my

2751
02:02:01.810 --> 02:02:03.630
understanding is that that --

2752
02:02:03.630 --> 02:02:05.500
the solicitations were issued --

2753
02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.440
mid year last year and contracts

2754
02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.980
or near finalization that's

2755
02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:10.570
what I've heard and it looks

2756
02:02:10.570 --> 02:02:12.880
like at the between P. Ginny

2757
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:15.000
and East Bay community energy

2758
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:16.440
this is another interesting

2759
02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.770
twist on this processes

2760
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:19.700
that they collaborated and

2761
02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:22.030
coordinated their solicitations

2762
02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:24.250
because the utility need some

2763
02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:26.910
some of the the aspects of

2764
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:28.850
the value those de ours is

2765
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:30.080
a community energy needs are

2766
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.570
a needs the actual energy

2767
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:34.130
so they work together which

2768
02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:35.600
shows that cooperation between

2769
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.270
these entities can occur and

2770
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:38.790
then successfully procure

2771
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.450
a resources to meet these

2772
02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:42.290
challenges so we think that

2773
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:44.380
this is a really promising and

2774
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.490
trailblazing -- project and

2775
02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:49.330
shows that what can a curve

2776
02:02:49.330 --> 02:02:50.980
when utilities and CCA's

2777
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:54.580
collaborate and coordinate when

2778
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:57.100
-- needs are identified with

2779
02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:58.980
and their utility territories

2780
02:02:59.590 --> 02:03:01.420
-- without all stop and

2781
02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:02.560
-- I'll be happy to answer

2782
02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:05.100
questions thank you thank

2783
02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.620
you I will turn out to Beth font

2784
02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:12.420
okay so I note that I left

2785
02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:13.800
the room for a moment and

2786
02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.770
you gentleman left me with

2787
02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:16.070
the squeaky chair thank you

2788
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.390
so much not all by design

2789
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.330
not called hand not cool

2790
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:24.260
okay -- good afternoon chair

2791
02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.620
and members -- thank you so

2792
02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:26.500
much for the opportunity to

2793
02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.690
speak with you today -- high

2794
02:03:28.690 --> 02:03:29.880
-- as you mentioned I'm Beth

2795
02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.230
Fong the executive director of

2796
02:03:31.230 --> 02:03:32.450
the California community choice

2797
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:35.500
association I am and Kelsey

2798
02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.170
CA and as a many speakers

2799
02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:40.010
before me have explains --

2800
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.060
the CCA's are exploding on the

2801
02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.570
scene here there are nineteen

2802
02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:45.570
CCA's now in operation serving

2803
02:03:45.570 --> 02:03:48.050
customers about approximately

2804
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:49.450
forty four thousand gigawatt

2805
02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:52.290
-- -- hours of annual load

2806
02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:54.130
-- it's about twenty five

2807
02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:55.480
percent of the total aye I

2808
02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.100
-- use territory in here in

2809
02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:58.330
kitchen is territory it said

2810
02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:00.770
about forty six percent so

2811
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.990
-- there are growing we are

2812
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:04.690
growing forest's -- and and

2813
02:04:04.690 --> 02:04:05.930
I I think is we charge ahead

2814
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:07.440
on RD carbonization goals is

2815
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.610
present picker pointed out

2816
02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:10.380
it's become increasingly clear

2817
02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:11.770
that the traditional vertically

2818
02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:13.640
integrated -- bundled utility

2819
02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.750
models not the future and for

2820
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:17.230
millions of California's that

2821
02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:19.400
models already shifted to the

2822
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:20.760
alternative which is community

2823
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.790
choice aggregation cece's

2824
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:24.550
represent local decision making

2825
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:26.050
power procured by locals for

2826
02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:27.340
locals and with local needs

2827
02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:29.110
and preferences in mind I'm

2828
02:04:29.110 --> 02:04:30.900
in touch on three things today

2829
02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:33.620
one is -- the credit

2830
02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.300
worthiness and renewable

2831
02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:37.360
print procurement second is

2832
02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.840
reliability and I want to take

2833
02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.130
a moment to talk about this

2834
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:42.340
-- developing a shared vision

2835
02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.200
of the future that kind of

2836
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.730
following on from your comments

2837
02:04:45.730 --> 02:04:47.350
Scott about collaboration

2838
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:51.480
so in terms of procurement arm

2839
02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:52.830
there's been some discussion

2840
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:54.550
around whether CCA's have

2841
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:56.150
the financial wherewithal to

2842
02:04:56.150 --> 02:04:57.370
build new renewable projects

2843
02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.540
on a scale that the investor

2844
02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:00.830
owned utilities wants to --

2845
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:02.270
did or enter into contracts

2846
02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.250
for reliability needs so we

2847
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:05.480
are the new players in an

2848
02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:07.390
uncertain market and I I get

2849
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:08.840
that there's been this concern

2850
02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:11.080
I am I think that most people

2851
02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:12.910
know MC ET -- got a credit

2852
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:14.330
rating investment grade credit

2853
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:15.780
rating this year but what I

2854
02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:18.230
want to say is that -- an entity

2855
02:05:18.230 --> 02:05:19.550
doesn't have to have a credit

2856
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:21.170
rating to be credit worthy

2857
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:23.200
and this if you speak with the

2858
02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:24.360
large institutional lenders

2859
02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.660
have told us in an invite you

2860
02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.210
to invite them here to speak to

2861
02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:29.470
you that they regard CCA's in a

2862
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:31.140
similar way to ms Eunice police

2863
02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:33.030
-- utilities and the reason

2864
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.980
for that is because of the

2865
02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:36.730
single digit opt out on average

2866
02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.930
across the CCA's as well

2867
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:40.250
as being transparent public

2868
02:05:40.250 --> 02:05:42.380
agencies they must publicly post

2869
02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:44.750
financial statements and

2870
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:45.840
certainly I would say the large

2871
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.290
number of bidders for anyone see

2872
02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:49.300
see solicitation speaks volumes

2873
02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:51.140
to how the market perceive CCS

2874
02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:53.460
so I want to talk a little bit

2875
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:55.610
about the rate of change --

2876
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:58.550
a year ago exactly a

2877
02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.430
year ago -- Kelsey CA

2878
02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:02.500
went to have a look at what

2879
02:06:02.690 --> 02:06:05.000
had been procured by the CCA's

2880
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.340
in terms of new were noble

2881
02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:08.910
development and it the number

2882
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:09.960
we came up with was eleven

2883
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:11.430
hundred megawatts and that was a

2884
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.950
total of five CCA's that had

2885
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:15.530
all launched by the end of

2886
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:17.590
twenty sixteen represented a

2887
02:06:17.590 --> 02:06:19.690
total of fifty four hundred

2888
02:06:19.690 --> 02:06:20.980
gigawatt hours was there any

2889
02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:23.600
allowed alright so then

2890
02:06:23.630 --> 02:06:25.520
present picker a referred to

2891
02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:26.850
-- some materials that we have

2892
02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:28.910
provided and hopefully those

2893
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:30.990
been handed out I look at the

2894
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:33.170
back there -- I think it was

2895
02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.220
no I got something else for you

2896
02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:39.550
here -- present picker referred

2897
02:06:39.550 --> 02:06:41.420
to a number of contracts that

2898
02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:44.110
CCA's hide -- --

2899
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:47.500
published -- in November of

2900
02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:49.000
twenty eighteen so I have for

2901
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.570
you the map of where

2902
02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.800
these -- locations are for

2903
02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.860
these -- different -- projects

2904
02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:58.290
and on the back through the

2905
02:06:58.290 --> 02:06:59.330
press release that came out

2906
02:06:59.330 --> 02:07:00.470
as well that will give you

2907
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:02.050
that break down the stats but

2908
02:07:02.050 --> 02:07:03.080
on the back to the list of

2909
02:07:03.110 --> 02:07:05.160
all of the publicly of the --

2910
02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:08.000
contracts we're very transparent

2911
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.500
public agencies there's fifty

2912
02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:11.300
nine contracts listed here on

2913
02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.370
the back fifty six of those

2914
02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:14.710
are for your or for greater

2915
02:07:14.710 --> 02:07:16.680
than ten years which going

2916
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.120
to Mister Christians point

2917
02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:19.380
when we're looking at --

2918
02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:21.290
twenty twenty one others their

2919
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:23.390
carmine SB three fifty that

2920
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:25.660
sixty percent of -- analyses

2921
02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:26.730
portfolio have these long

2922
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:29.190
term contracts so there is a

2923
02:07:29.190 --> 02:07:31.470
commitment here these are in

2924
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:33.790
total represent eleven CCA's

2925
02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:35.300
because one of the CCA's in

2926
02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:38.020
here is -- procuring on behalf

2927
02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:39.950
of for such a joint procurement

2928
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:41.590
down in southern California

2929
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:46.260
so now where we now -- that

2930
02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:47.770
was November of twenty eighteen

2931
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:49.800
right now there are several

2932
02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.770
CCA's -- -- I'm sorry there's

2933
02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:52.690
one other thing when I talk

2934
02:07:52.690 --> 02:07:53.650
about Choi procurement that I

2935
02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:54.800
want to highlight and it's in

2936
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.640
the press release there but in

2937
02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:59.170
here we have -- also joint

2938
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:01.100
CCA's of Monterey Bay community

2939
02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:02.550
power in Silicon Valley clean

2940
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:05.340
energy -- together

2941
02:08:05.370 --> 02:08:07.220
jointly putting an R. F. P. out

2942
02:08:07.650 --> 02:08:09.350
and signing agreements totaling

2943
02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:10.330
almost two hundred eighty

2944
02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:11.690
megawatts of solar coupled with

2945
02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:12.950
three hundred forty megawatts

2946
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.710
battery storage for two separate

2947
02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:16.610
projects incurring can counties

2948
02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.580
so what I what I'm trying

2949
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:19.770
explains is a lot of sort

2950
02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:21.090
of experimentation going on

2951
02:08:21.090 --> 02:08:22.430
there in terms of this joint

2952
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:23.850
procurement in terms of being

2953
02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:25.350
able to go out and procure those

2954
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:28.380
large -- sums of megawatts

2955
02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:29.980
that present picker preferred to

2956
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.010
so where are we now it's the

2957
02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:35.800
of February March of twenty

2958
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:38.490
eighteen twenty nineteen and

2959
02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:39.730
-- I want to say that serve

2960
02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.750
that several species including

2961
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:42.990
some that are recently launched

2962
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:44.880
program so remember last year

2963
02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.700
in twenty eighteen we had ten

2964
02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:49.400
CCA's launch service and in

2965
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.220
fact in February the clean

2966
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:53.520
power alliance in San Jose clean

2967
02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.000
energy both -- launched their

2968
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.520
third phase out to residential

2969
02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:59.230
customers we're we're talking

2970
02:08:59.410 --> 02:09:00.810
for CPA about a million

2971
02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.930
customers but I'm gonna pick on

2972
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:04.370
clean power lines for a moment

2973
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:07.300
so while they just wants to

2974
02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.700
a million residential customers

2975
02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:11.180
they have an RFP out there

2976
02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.610
seeking six hundred megawatts

2977
02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.220
of renewable energy and storage

2978
02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:16.170
clean power lines received

2979
02:09:16.530 --> 02:09:17.770
bids for two hundred thirty

2980
02:09:17.770 --> 02:09:19.810
four unique projects ranging

2981
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:21.380
from small scale battery energy

2982
02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:23.410
storage to large large utility

2983
02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:25.290
scale solar wind and geothermal

2984
02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:26.400
with many bits including an

2985
02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.660
energy storage component they've

2986
02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:29.880
shortlisted these candidates

2987
02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:31.720
and we expect by the end of

2988
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:32.930
spring early summer to have a

2989
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:35.460
list of finalize projects East

2990
02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:37.080
Bay community energy similar

2991
02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:39.730
story is it put a solicitation

2992
02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.990
last June they're also looking

2993
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:43.190
for six hundred to seven hundred

2994
02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:44.790
megawatts worth of new contracts

2995
02:09:45.090 --> 02:09:46.340
and they're negotiating fifteen

2996
02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:48.680
to twenty year agreements some

2997
02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.280
of the criteria is for local

2998
02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:52.980
projects some are not all of

2999
02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:55.280
them are in California again

3000
02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.730
there's Monterey Bay community

3001
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:58.690
-- energy inquiry committee

3002
02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:00.420
power a redwood coast which

3003
02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:02.160
is up in Humboldt County clean

3004
02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:03.900
power as south this California

3005
02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:05.150
choice energy authority that's

3006
02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:07.640
procuring on behalf of for and

3007
02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.340
it will be ten by twenty twenty

3008
02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:10.450
one that they'll be current

3009
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:12.310
on behalf of so basically

3010
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:13.190
what I'm trying to say is

3011
02:10:13.190 --> 02:10:14.500
that they're out there they're

3012
02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:15.570
doing the procurement and

3013
02:10:15.570 --> 02:10:16.940
when I add up all the numbers

3014
02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:18.260
I'm gonna conservatively say

3015
02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:20.520
that by July we should be

3016
02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:21.860
able to report out to another

3017
02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.680
fifteen hundred megawatts of

3018
02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:25.160
new renewable developments

3019
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.460
so the bottom line is is that

3020
02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:29.940
billions of dollars of financing

3021
02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.720
for major financial partners are

3022
02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.130
committed to build new projects

3023
02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.840
we've cataloged about thirteen

3024
02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:36.100
hundred of renewable energy

3025
02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:38.130
projects either built or being

3026
02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:40.490
built for CCA's with union labor

3027
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:41.930
I know that that's another issue

3028
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.810
that continued comes up we'll

3029
02:10:43.810 --> 02:10:45.400
be adding many more to this

3030
02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.020
list as project labor agreements

3031
02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.250
are put in place -- for some

3032
02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:50.450
of these new developments

3033
02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:53.510
I want to turn to reliability

3034
02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:55.320
-- one of the things I want

3035
02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:56.730
to make clear to you because I

3036
02:10:56.730 --> 02:10:59.280
think some it's not

3037
02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.180
clear to a lot of folks because

3038
02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:03.300
the governing board of the CCA

3039
02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:05.410
is it's elected officials in

3040
02:11:05.410 --> 02:11:07.290
the local community however we

3041
02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:08.870
are load serving and cities and

3042
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:11.070
therefore must comply and have

3043
02:11:11.070 --> 02:11:12.920
all the same obligations as the

3044
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.200
other load serving and cities

3045
02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.730
be the investor owned utilities

3046
02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:17.140
or energy service providers

3047
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:19.130
that means that we have to

3048
02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:20.250
comply with the state's resource

3049
02:11:20.250 --> 02:11:22.030
adequacy and renewable portfolio

3050
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:23.800
standard requirements also

3051
02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:25.420
have to it -- submit integrated

3052
02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:27.090
resource plans every two years

3053
02:11:28.110 --> 02:11:29.780
so I feel I just need to respond

3054
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:31.350
to present pickers common about

3055
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:33.530
the eleven waivers and and

3056
02:11:33.690 --> 02:11:35.030
he he is correct that there

3057
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.930
is an issue out there with

3058
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:37.160
waivers absolute agree but the

3059
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.050
eleven where waivers which are

3060
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:40.230
actually published on the C.

3061
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:42.650
P. UC's on website -- one

3062
02:11:42.650 --> 02:11:44.610
is an I owe you and the other

3063
02:11:44.610 --> 02:11:47.150
ten are electrics -- yes peas

3064
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:50.050
however he is correct that CCA's

3065
02:11:50.050 --> 02:11:51.770
in the last year have also --

3066
02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:53.250
fought for waivers that there

3067
02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:54.230
there there is a there is an

3068
02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:56.730
issue that has to be solved I'm

3069
02:11:56.850 --> 02:11:58.580
resource adequacy I just want

3070
02:11:58.580 --> 02:11:59.870
to point out is one component

3071
02:11:59.870 --> 02:12:01.620
of reliability so while the

3072
02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:04.230
commission set up are a policy

3073
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:06.840
-- all there there's also

3074
02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.990
rules the callous so as you

3075
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:09.050
heard from mark -- Mister

3076
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:10.770
ruff later and also the CC

3077
02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:13.890
so I want to go to what is the

3078
02:12:13.890 --> 02:12:14.840
problem that we're actually

3079
02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:16.900
trying to solve we've heard

3080
02:12:17.230 --> 02:12:18.260
a lot about what might be

3081
02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:20.570
going on but it would really

3082
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:21.780
help everyone to have a clear

3083
02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:23.180
assessment of the problem

3084
02:12:23.250 --> 02:12:25.360
there's no bottom up study of

3085
02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.700
how the disaggregated realty

3086
02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:28.050
retail market is actually

3087
02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:30.860
impacting the reliability market

3088
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:33.760
here's what we agree on we agree

3089
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:35.350
that the capacity market is

3090
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:37.200
tightening we understand that

3091
02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.420
low serving entities are filing

3092
02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:39.790
waivers but it's not clear that

3093
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:41.200
there isn't capacity available

3094
02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.630
for instance someone could

3095
02:12:42.630 --> 02:12:43.960
be holding on to our it as a

3096
02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.750
buffer against possible future

3097
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:48.040
loads shifting or the floor

3098
02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:49.530
price could be unreasonable

3099
02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:52.180
so there's a number of solutions

3100
02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:53.290
and I think that I have to

3101
02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:55.240
compliment -- the si PC I think

3102
02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.950
by putting out a decision that

3103
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.620
the majority of people didn't

3104
02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.020
agree with actually pushed

3105
02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:01.740
us to collaborate there are

3106
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:02.940
others a lot of discussions

3107
02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:04.180
going on there are very

3108
02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:05.600
interesting ex parte meetings

3109
02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.290
with interesting bedfellows

3110
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:09.330
-- but I think that everyone

3111
02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:11.480
there's of of of a sense of

3112
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:13.160
urgency in a flurry in a frenzy

3113
02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:14.610
to to to really work together

3114
02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:16.620
to find a solution here so we

3115
02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:17.950
all agree that the forecasting

3116
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:19.210
allocation process needs to

3117
02:13:19.210 --> 02:13:21.200
be fixed and all stakeholders

3118
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.170
including energy division

3119
02:13:22.170 --> 02:13:23.500
staff of waited with lots of

3120
02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:25.500
good ideas we all agree that

3121
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.490
a multi year are a obligation

3122
02:13:27.490 --> 02:13:28.490
is the right framework going

3123
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:30.850
forward we propose putting

3124
02:13:30.850 --> 02:13:32.450
in place a utility near term

3125
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:34.170
sales framework to facilitate

3126
02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:35.650
getting the are a products

3127
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:37.680
in the utility portfolios

3128
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:39.300
out into the market with

3129
02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:40.790
load moving to the C. C. A.'s

3130
02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:41.950
the excess supply from the

3131
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:43.410
I owe you should also follow

3132
02:13:44.710 --> 02:13:46.010
Kelsey see has consistently

3133
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:47.910
attic advocated for LSE's Max

3134
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:49.490
myself procurement before any

3135
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:51.660
central procurement however if

3136
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.860
there is a local ari shortfall

3137
02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.060
then the CCA support the notion

3138
02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:57.260
of residual procurement by

3139
02:13:57.260 --> 02:13:58.570
central procurement and city

3140
02:14:00.670 --> 02:14:02.260
I think energy division stop in

3141
02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:03.680
the a truck three report that

3142
02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.780
came out this week proposed

3143
02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:06.130
a simple yet we think very

3144
02:14:06.130 --> 02:14:07.610
effective idea which is that

3145
02:14:07.610 --> 02:14:08.880
all the load serving and cities

3146
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:10.130
need to communicate better

3147
02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.320
with each other at particularly

3148
02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.730
in terms of the process of

3149
02:14:13.730 --> 02:14:15.200
forecasting an allocation

3150
02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:18.710
but see sees are not sitting

3151
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:19.840
idle why these issues are

3152
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.060
being hostile in policy venues

3153
02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:23.770
instead were coming together

3154
02:14:23.770 --> 02:14:25.380
to identify new and innovative

3155
02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:26.430
ways of addressing the local

3156
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:28.680
reliability issues so for

3157
02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.190
instance I know a year ago

3158
02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:33.050
-- Mister kirke were very

3159
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:34.210
concerned about Metcalf for

3160
02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:36.580
instance what we're doing now

3161
02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:38.130
is experimenting with this

3162
02:14:38.130 --> 02:14:40.750
joint CCA procurement and the

3163
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:42.840
reliability area collectively

3164
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.870
we have five C. C. A.'s with an

3165
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:46.320
aggregate load of nearly twenty

3166
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.670
thousand gigawatt hours so

3167
02:14:48.670 --> 02:14:50.030
think about P. Jeannie when you

3168
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:52.820
take out the -- G. efficiency

3169
02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:55.120
in the D. A.'s the CCA is there

3170
02:14:55.150 --> 02:14:57.140
-- the load is about thirty

3171
02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.350
eight thousand gigawatt hours

3172
02:14:59.050 --> 02:15:00.710
so that group of five continues

3173
02:15:00.710 --> 02:15:03.110
CCA's in the southern bay area

3174
02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:04.970
have come together they have an

3175
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:07.190
are a photo out to contract for

3176
02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:08.990
joint are a portfolio services

3177
02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.260
this will enable them to procure

3178
02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:13.310
at scale multi year are a

3179
02:15:13.850 --> 02:15:15.650
said we're trying to respond

3180
02:15:15.650 --> 02:15:16.620
to the problems that have been

3181
02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:19.480
identified all right lastly

3182
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:20.460
I just want to take a moment

3183
02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.970
to talk about it developing a

3184
02:15:21.970 --> 02:15:24.110
shared vision so the session

3185
02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:26.730
-- has been titled -- the

3186
02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:28.160
metamorphosis of the energy

3187
02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.660
sector so when I think about

3188
02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:31.900
I think of the caterpillar

3189
02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.800
transforming into the butterfly

3190
02:15:34.810 --> 02:15:35.980
I guess my question to all of

3191
02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.670
us is is what is our butterfly

3192
02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:39.180
what is it that we're trying to

3193
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:41.820
change into and I think that we

3194
02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:43.090
really we were all really good

3195
02:15:43.090 --> 02:15:44.580
at identifying lots of problems

3196
02:15:44.610 --> 02:15:45.740
I think that we really need

3197
02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:46.940
to develop a shared vision of

3198
02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:49.200
the future so I'm gonna start

3199
02:15:49.590 --> 02:15:50.800
and I'm gonna be controversial

3200
02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:52.730
just so we can start having the

3201
02:15:52.730 --> 02:15:55.120
conversation with some press

3202
02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.420
stating publicly that wants

3203
02:15:56.450 --> 02:15:57.550
out of the power generation

3204
02:15:57.550 --> 02:15:59.630
and procurement business N. P.

3205
02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:01.460
Jeannie choosing to file chapter

3206
02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:03.300
eleven reorganization bankruptcy

3207
02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:07.160
well they elected to file

3208
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:09.300
they didn't have all right

3209
02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:10.990
I think we should be talking

3210
02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:12.390
about in a in a not so distant

3211
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:14.000
instance distant future with

3212
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.520
the utilities focus on the safe

3213
02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.930
management other electric Sir

3214
02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.690
infrastructure and essentially

3215
02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:20.220
become a wires only business

3216
02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:22.300
this plant there is an idea

3217
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.590
if that's the in in game then

3218
02:16:24.590 --> 02:16:26.130
we only to think about what is

3219
02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:27.170
the framework we need to put

3220
02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:28.470
in place that will ensure clean

3221
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:30.170
reliable and affordable electric

3222
02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:31.380
generation service for all

3223
02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:34.170
customers that will also ensure

3224
02:16:34.170 --> 02:16:35.050
that we meet our aggressive

3225
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:37.310
climate goals so I

3226
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:39.740
have a few ideas also

3227
02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:42.820
controversial I'm fully empower

3228
02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:44.390
local agency providers to

3229
02:16:44.390 --> 02:16:45.840
advance California's chronicles

3230
02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:47.110
and by that I mean to assist

3231
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:48.200
teaching is accent from the

3232
02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:49.730
retail service for example

3233
02:16:50.130 --> 02:16:51.290
and give local governments the

3234
02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:52.810
ability to expand their energy

3235
02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.240
electricity programs in a manner

3236
02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:55.670
that fits the needs of the local

3237
02:16:55.670 --> 02:16:57.510
community that could include

3238
02:16:57.510 --> 02:16:58.770
absorbing P. genies remaining

3239
02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:00.740
bundle customers the option to

3240
02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:02.460
service provider of last resort

3241
02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:04.580
option to service all retail

3242
02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:07.150
provider -- in I think

3243
02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:08.210
support the existing rights

3244
02:17:08.210 --> 02:17:09.550
of little local jurisdictions

3245
02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:10.790
to establish publicly owned

3246
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:12.540
utilities by removing barriers

3247
02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:14.200
taxed expedite the process

3248
02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:19.280
well but that raises the

3249
02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.160
question about what of the

3250
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:21.180
what about the parts of the

3251
02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.560
state where public power option

3252
02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:24.220
isn't readily available I

3253
02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:25.130
think we need to talk about

3254
02:17:25.130 --> 02:17:26.330
the establishment of statewide

3255
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:27.940
public agency to serve final

3256
02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.460
customers until public option

3257
02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.610
is available we would also need

3258
02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.890
a plan to rebalance the I'll

3259
02:17:32.890 --> 02:17:34.700
use portfolios this is been

3260
02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:36.070
happening slowly with the sale

3261
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:38.060
of I'll use a renewable and

3262
02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:39.640
ari products to realign supply

3263
02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:41.210
and demand to follow the party

3264
02:17:41.210 --> 02:17:42.570
low customers but there need to

3265
02:17:42.570 --> 02:17:44.000
be a structure divestment plan

3266
02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:45.810
and if you really think about

3267
02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:47.190
what reliability looks like in

3268
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:48.400
a future without the fleet of

3269
02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:50.790
gas fired power plants then

3270
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:53.190
it's got to be based on investor

3271
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:54.420
owned utility distribution

3272
02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.080
system with a transparent open

3273
02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:57.780
access platform that facilitates

3274
02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:00.100
the deployment of distribution

3275
02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:01.720
energy resources the DVR's

3276
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.650
that Scott spoke have and

3277
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:04.770
other demand side management

3278
02:18:04.770 --> 02:18:07.530
strategies okay I know

3279
02:18:07.850 --> 02:18:09.260
that these ideas just add to the

3280
02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:10.750
controversy in the complexity

3281
02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.340
but I think that without a

3282
02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:14.500
clear vision of what we want to

3283
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:16.720
transform into -- they were

3284
02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:17.710
just gonna spend our wheels

3285
02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:18.870
trying to solve problems issue

3286
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:19.990
by issue and run the risk that

3287
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:21.250
all the pieces won't add up to

3288
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:22.360
a whole at the end of the day

3289
02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:24.060
so I look forward to working

3290
02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:25.440
collaboratively with legislators

3291
02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:26.790
and the stakeholders to develop

3292
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:28.110
a shared vision of the future

3293
02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.600
and just all these complex

3294
02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:32.740
problems thank you

3295
02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:36.070
it's just money Jones I

3296
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:37.940
see I drove but Sherman holding

3297
02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:39.270
out so you're now the chair

3298
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:40.690
congradulations let me be that

3299
02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:43.610
-- in let me assure you for

3300
02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:44.900
from the get go that the

3301
02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:46.850
electrons that I represent are

3302
02:18:46.850 --> 02:18:48.370
of the highest moral caliber

3303
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:50.240
-- today as a matter of fact

3304
02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.400
some of our more moral than

3305
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:52.650
others but they're all very

3306
02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:54.910
moral and -- -- actually -- it's

3307
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:56.020
been my experience that like

3308
02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:57.920
tries have are pretty a moral

3309
02:18:58.010 --> 02:18:59.070
which is why we're having this

3310
02:18:59.070 --> 02:19:00.920
conversation today -- so I'm

3311
02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:02.160
Janice but he Johnson with the

3312
02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.440
independent energy producers --

3313
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:05.730
we are an institution it's been

3314
02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:06.740
around since nineteen eighty

3315
02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:08.690
to represent one of everybody

3316
02:19:08.930 --> 02:19:10.660
so solar wind geothermal

3317
02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:13.630
biomass and natural gas -- in

3318
02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:15.310
-- in various in storage as

3319
02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:17.450
well -- we operated a whole

3320
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:18.660
cell function we think of

3321
02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:19.850
us as costs go where you can

3322
02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:22.440
get a lot of stuff cheap --

3323
02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:24.890
and or cheaper -- weird --

3324
02:19:24.890 --> 02:19:26.400
known for pushing technologies a

3325
02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:27.570
lot of the technologies that are

3326
02:19:27.570 --> 02:19:29.370
here today with us -- we have

3327
02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:30.950
and -- been in the forefront

3328
02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.920
-- but we also build awful

3329
02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:34.820
what we know -- and what has

3330
02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:36.760
worked and so I think a lot of

3331
02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.400
what the discussions are here

3332
02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:40.630
in the legislature -- as good

3333
02:19:40.630 --> 02:19:42.410
as we go forward should be about

3334
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:44.190
predicated on that a colleague

3335
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:45.310
of mine was talking to me this

3336
02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:46.950
morning about our our integrated

3337
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:49.530
resource plan which is -- sort

3338
02:19:49.530 --> 02:19:51.520
of now become a thing of its

3339
02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.670
own -- is where we want to be

3340
02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:54.930
that's the vision of where we're

3341
02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:56.100
going to be in twenty thirty and

3342
02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:58.160
twenty fifty -- are a as with

3343
02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:59.730
-- you know what we need to be

3344
02:19:59.930 --> 02:20:01.900
-- and that's today reliability

3345
02:20:01.930 --> 02:20:03.760
now -- and it's pretty straight

3346
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:05.760
forward -- you know -- resource

3347
02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.890
adequacy is -- having the --

3348
02:20:07.890 --> 02:20:10.080
-- the energy available -- when

3349
02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:12.040
you need it where you need it --

3350
02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.340
for adequate period of time --

3351
02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:17.120
and -- -- I just have to share

3352
02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:19.550
it underscore the point that

3353
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:21.100
reliability is the key here

3354
02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:23.730
okay if we suddenly start having

3355
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:25.550
reliability problems based on

3356
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:27.350
decisions we've made because of

3357
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:29.170
a moral generation for example

3358
02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:30.840
or anything else all bets are

3359
02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.770
off on our aspirational goals

3360
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:35.020
-- I had the misfortune of value

3361
02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:37.080
the deal with them -- can get

3362
02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.710
president picker walking us down

3363
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:40.200
memory lane of the San Diego

3364
02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:43.270
situation -- you know -- I live

3365
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:44.700
to that and you don't you don't

3366
02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:46.090
want to go through that trust me

3367
02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:49.110
-- wholesale model -- has worked

3368
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:51.030
well and are a terms of of

3369
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:52.670
understanding -- what generally

3370
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:54.540
needs to happen -- but at that

3371
02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:55.910
I think is you've heard as we've

3372
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:57.790
talked a long a lot of this is

3373
02:20:57.790 --> 02:21:00.230
local very specific in terms of

3374
02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:02.330
of the locality we have sort of

3375
02:21:02.370 --> 02:21:04.240
-- -- research and it was the

3376
02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:05.480
in a broader range but a lot of

3377
02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:06.980
times this is driven by unique

3378
02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:09.570
-- local -- circumstances of the

3379
02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:12.330
geographic area -- I think

3380
02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:13.870
it's got indicated you have seen

3381
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:15.510
this market shift occur over the

3382
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:18.110
last -- so over years where

3383
02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.180
-- we have added a significant

3384
02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:21.940
amount of solar -- just to put

3385
02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:24.030
this in perspective in -- two

3386
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:25.170
thousand eight we had three

3387
02:21:25.170 --> 02:21:26.410
hundred megawatts of utility

3388
02:21:26.410 --> 02:21:28.120
scale solar -- today we have

3389
02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:29.880
over eleven thousand megawatts

3390
02:21:29.970 --> 02:21:31.730
-- the Costa affordable takes

3391
02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:33.790
a utility scale in two thousand

3392
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:35.090
eight was fifty to sixty cents a

3393
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:36.630
kilowatt hour people are coming

3394
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:38.890
online now -- sub five cents

3395
02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:41.130
and actually sub three cents my

3396
02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:42.420
job is to help build markets of

3397
02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:43.800
people make lose money I don't

3398
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:44.920
know but that's their business

3399
02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:47.360
-- the -- peak a ship that

3400
02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.350
however -- because while that

3401
02:21:49.350 --> 02:21:50.960
is a success is got indicated

3402
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:52.370
we moved at the peak from that

3403
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:54.190
date to elsewhere -- the peak is

3404
02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:55.740
now shifted to up to forty nine

3405
02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.700
o'clock in this is what we're

3406
02:21:57.700 --> 02:21:59.350
the challenge becomes because

3407
02:21:59.350 --> 02:22:00.760
even in California we have a

3408
02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.340
fairly regular occurrence of

3409
02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:03.800
the sun no longer being with us

3410
02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:06.690
-- this brings up the role a

3411
02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:08.080
gas and I'm just going to say

3412
02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:09.120
you know I don't give it many

3413
02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.740
opportunities to say nice things

3414
02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:12.790
about gas because that's not

3415
02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:15.670
acceptable anymore -- but the

3416
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:17.550
gas is -- the work course from

3417
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:19.340
the standpoint of how we meet

3418
02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:22.400
-- -- resource adequacy today

3419
02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:25.300
-- and a and -- while the

3420
02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:27.660
role of gas has been --

3421
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:30.380
-- dropping -- is the

3422
02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:31.910
annual energy mix for twenty

3423
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.950
eighteen gas was about thirty

3424
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:35.660
percent of the overall mix

3425
02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.280
-- in that the twenty fifteen

3426
02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:38.650
it was forty percent so it is

3427
02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:40.470
it so it has been impacted by

3428
02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:42.240
additional -- you primarily

3429
02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.420
so -- ended a resource however

3430
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:46.460
and this is important as as

3431
02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:48.490
a part of peak resources it's

3432
02:22:48.490 --> 02:22:50.710
over fifty percent meeting that

3433
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:51.910
the lights would not of state

3434
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:53.560
on had they not been there at

3435
02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:54.770
those plans not been able to

3436
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:56.590
ramp up and ramp down so it's

3437
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:59.230
reliable it's affordable -- it's

3438
02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:01.400
there now -- and these are

3439
02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:03.220
modern plants I I spent a lot

3440
02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:05.310
of time having to argue about

3441
02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:06.880
the -- the the -- the resources

3442
02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.960
California has added are clean

3443
02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.070
resources we have renewables and

3444
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:12.740
a modern gas plants are clean

3445
02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:14.360
they they are -- you know from

3446
02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:16.170
the standpoint of I think the I

3447
02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:18.550
SO study for on SB three fifty

3448
02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:20.320
-- in I think it was twenty

3449
02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:22.430
fifteen twenty fifteen data

3450
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:24.140
that was forty percent of the

3451
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:27.060
Daniel energy mix and was left

3452
02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:28.310
it was about one percent of

3453
02:23:28.310 --> 02:23:29.920
the criteria pollutants so

3454
02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.990
it is not a major -- -- eight

3455
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:33.220
environmental impact on our

3456
02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:34.560
state and by the way they have

3457
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:36.140
to buy offsets for everything

3458
02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:38.380
they produce including -- CO two

3459
02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:40.950
so -- it's part of the mix and

3460
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:43.160
and and what I want levy with

3461
02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.240
on that is is that that's going

3462
02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:47.550
to be with this for a while so

3463
02:23:47.930 --> 02:23:49.690
rather than wasting time on how

3464
02:23:49.690 --> 02:23:51.240
quickly we can shut that down

3465
02:23:51.450 --> 02:23:52.740
if there are improvements we

3466
02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:54.110
can make it other technologies

3467
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:55.470
great but that's going to be

3468
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:57.650
with us for awhile storage has

3469
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:58.910
been desperate is proving to be

3470
02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:00.650
very useful I was part of the

3471
02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:03.080
-- get a get a air resources

3472
02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:05.010
board -- technology advancement

3473
02:24:05.010 --> 02:24:06.900
-- committee -- ten years ago

3474
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:08.500
we identified storage is game

3475
02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:10.020
changer that's proving to be

3476
02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:12.210
true -- and we are working it

3477
02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:14.310
into the system -- in places

3478
02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:15.990
where it makes sense -- the that

3479
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:17.380
is very good at regulation is

3480
02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:18.610
very good at a number of things

3481
02:24:18.890 --> 02:24:21.270
-- it is still -- it

3482
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:22.520
at the beginning stage from the

3483
02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.330
standpoint of -- how it is in

3484
02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:25.780
the market but we anticipate

3485
02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.520
that going forward civil my

3486
02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:29.630
members had built hybrid systems

3487
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:30.600
as a matter of fact one of my

3488
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.070
members was one of the first to

3489
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:34.010
build those systems -- it down a

3490
02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:36.390
chili so -- the the there there

3491
02:24:36.390 --> 02:24:38.690
is a -- -- you know with that

3492
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:39.930
this is becoming an increasing

3493
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:42.090
amount of our resource mix --

3494
02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:44.290
there is a tension -- -- the

3495
02:24:44.290 --> 02:24:46.170
the -- it with respect to again

3496
02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.930
we represent wholesale storage

3497
02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:49.640
there is -- destructive energy

3498
02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:50.660
which I think Scott referred

3499
02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:52.080
to there's a there's a lot of

3500
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:53.450
technical issues where there

3501
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:55.180
is some tension with respect to

3502
02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.940
how how things get integrated

3503
02:24:57.940 --> 02:24:59.300
in the cal I SO wholesale

3504
02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.860
market what the rules apply and

3505
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:03.540
we're we are sensitive about

3506
02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:04.690
that from the standpoint of

3507
02:25:04.690 --> 02:25:06.480
we operate our whole so rules

3508
02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:07.470
and if people want to join

3509
02:25:07.470 --> 02:25:09.360
our party that's great I would

3510
02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.630
necessarily recommended but

3511
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:11.870
you're welcome to it but you

3512
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:13.140
got to play by the same rules

3513
02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.970
-- and this gets Donald bunny

3514
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:16.600
trail detail real quick but

3515
02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.830
the point is that there is a

3516
02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:19.010
tension there that would not

3517
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.380
withstand effect that we support

3518
02:25:20.650 --> 02:25:21.970
a storage an obvious he's got

3519
02:25:21.970 --> 02:25:23.480
support storage there are live

3520
02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.950
issues that may or may not

3521
02:25:24.980 --> 02:25:27.200
pop up here -- -- that the at

3522
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.360
the the other issue that I think

3523
02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:30.590
is important and I just want

3524
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:32.210
to go through -- this fairly

3525
02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:34.600
quickly about what else -- is

3526
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.890
in the system that we can be

3527
02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:38.980
looking towards -- assisting

3528
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:39.890
on some of the resource

3529
02:25:39.890 --> 02:25:41.690
adequacy needs is geographic

3530
02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:43.280
scope -- which I think that

3531
02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.120
-- -- Mr Holden referred to

3532
02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.690
earlier -- we do have Nguyen

3533
02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:48.150

3534
02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:50.780
that are -- -- that operate

3535
02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:52.210
at different times and said in

3536
02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:53.400
fact some of them during our

3537
02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:55.040
peeks here -- that we should

3538
02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.720
be avail in ourselves to and

3539
02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:58.250
we need to be very clear that

3540
02:25:58.250 --> 02:26:00.530
the I SO in the P. you see --

3541
02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:02.910
are -- adequately looking at

3542
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:04.360
in properly planning for the

3543
02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:05.730
future need to add additional

3544
02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:07.420
interstate transmission to avail

3545
02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.280

-- we have great geothermal

state primarily in Mr Garcia's

3552
02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:21.590
district -- and -- and and

3553
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:22.800
in the end those in northern

3554
02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:25.410
California to -- -- in --

3555
02:26:25.410 --> 02:26:27.120
in in the -- Lake County in

3556
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.220
cinema area -- we've got a by a

3557
02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:30.790
mass technologies where it which

3558
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:32.180
are an integral part of our

3559
02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:34.080
-- California's route -- rural

3560
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:35.560
and agriculture communities

3561
02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:36.490
we're going to continue to grow

3562
02:26:36.490 --> 02:26:38.670
food -- in California that's

3563
02:26:38.670 --> 02:26:39.580
a place we should you know

3564
02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.390
look and did simple fact of

3565
02:26:41.390 --> 02:26:42.430
the matter is we are gonna see

3566
02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:44.440
solar continue to grow it is

3567
02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:46.770
a very low cost resource and

3568
02:26:46.770 --> 02:26:48.900
the the the issue for re -- for

3569
02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.650
developers of solar is how to

3570
02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:52.020
keep that going because at some

3571
02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:54.060
point in time you run into --

3572
02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:56.130
if the at the vet the eight the

3573
02:26:56.130 --> 02:26:57.560
economic value of the energy

3574
02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:59.490
your supply in mid day is zero

3575
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.560
you're not going to get up in

3576
02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:02.300
volume so the question is where

3577
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.980
you know where we're going to

3578
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:04.350
put those resources and I think

3579
02:27:04.350 --> 02:27:05.740
we've got a lot of things we

3580
02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.190
can be doing with access seller

3581
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:08.210
in the middle of the day when

3582
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:09.910
that is an issue with respect

3583
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:11.810
with which respect to -- water

3584
02:27:11.810 --> 02:27:13.660
press process seen a which is

3585
02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:15.580
-- is heavily dependent upon

3586
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:17.370
electricity prices hydrogen

3587
02:27:17.370 --> 02:27:18.860
production manufacturing that

3588
02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:20.990
sort of thing so that so

3589
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.910
that's kind of where things

3590
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:23.370
set it right now in terms of

3591
02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:25.180
challenges exist in are a --

3592
02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:26.710
we've just finished one cycle

3593
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:28.550
we are slowly moving towards

3594
02:27:28.810 --> 02:27:30.170
something that may make sense

3595
02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.000
of -- -- did it finally adopted

3596
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.750
a multi year are a before it

3597
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:36.910
was only an annual -- -- --

3598
02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:38.830
resource adequacy proposal

3599
02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:40.290
meeting that day they only had a

3600
02:27:40.290 --> 02:27:42.690
super -- -- look one year out

3601
02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:44.560
the reason that's a problem is

3602
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.520
that if you need to make it --

3603
02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:47.990
economic investments in your

3604
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:49.330
equipment if you're gas plant

3605
02:27:49.330 --> 02:27:51.180
for example you need to make --

3606
02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:52.400
some maintenance upgrades not

3607
02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.420
be doing that you're going to be

3608
02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:55.460
needed sec and I would argue the

3609
02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:56.960
same is true for demand response

3610
02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:58.800
or storage -- doing that on an

3611
02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:00.290
annual basis is very difficult

3612
02:28:00.290 --> 02:28:01.660
to do in any sort of affordable

3613
02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:03.400
way so the longer it's art

3614
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.060
lovers out the lower the prices

3615
02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.170
and I think the better off it

3616
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:08.470
is they -- we supported the

3617
02:28:08.470 --> 02:28:10.630
energy -- divisions -- argument

3618
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:11.780
for a five year that didn't

3619
02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:13.110
happen we really wanted to see

3620
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:14.340
a three year eighty percent

3621
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:16.580
that didn't occur either --

3622
02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:18.740
but we will remain -- you know

3623
02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:21.210
active in the -- that in the

3624
02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:23.030
discussion there -- there was

3625
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:24.490
discussion earlier on central

3626
02:28:24.490 --> 02:28:25.420
buyer and I know there's a

3627
02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:26.880
there's a proposal least one

3628
02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.300
bill at a pop up here at some

3629
02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.460
point in time -- you know

3630
02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:31.850
we're talking about that we're

3631
02:28:31.850 --> 02:28:32.780
we're trying to figure out

3632
02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:34.130
how that actually would work

3633
02:28:34.350 --> 02:28:37.050
of who who does that -- --

3634
02:28:37.330 --> 02:28:39.760
I'd not sure that -- ms lines

3635
02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:41.400
the invitation have a state

3636
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:43.720
a procurer for most of the

3637
02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:45.410
state makes a lot of sense in

3638
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:46.900
terms of a provider last resort

3639
02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:49.450
that seems to me to be racing

3640
02:28:49.450 --> 02:28:51.340
backwards -- pretty quickly but

3641
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:52.940
will look at it we just want to

3642
02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:54.480
make sure the metamorphosis is

3643
02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:56.460
swallows and -- -- -- beautiful

3644
02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:58.820
-- -- it as well -- tales

3645
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:01.140
and not -- you crappie moths so

3646
02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:02.810
-- the that's the -- the other

3647
02:29:02.810 --> 02:29:05.270
option there so -- it but I do

3648
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:06.610
want to say that I that I think

3649
02:29:06.610 --> 02:29:08.190
that -- one of the things that

3650
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:10.540
-- -- Beth also indicated with

3651
02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:12.700
this aggregation of CCA's --

3652
02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:15.560
vats helpful -- because part

3653
02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.040
of the problem is my people

3654
02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.170
sold anybody -- because we're

3655
02:29:19.170 --> 02:29:21.790
selling -- a moral electron so

3656
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.890
-- but it the -- the ability

3657
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:27.430
-- the the the the closer people

3658
02:29:27.430 --> 02:29:29.610
are -- it the larger the volume

3659
02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:31.550
and geographic where you to

3660
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:32.810
where they need to go is very

3661
02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:34.720
important because you know it

3662
02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:35.580
it's one thing that have to

3663
02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:37.220
do you know thirteen or twenty

3664
02:29:37.290 --> 02:29:38.820
deals with the off the five

3665
02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:40.130
megawatts at a time you know

3666
02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:41.350
at being able to respond to

3667
02:29:41.350 --> 02:29:42.250
something that's two hundred

3668
02:29:42.250 --> 02:29:44.070
megawatts -- you still have

3669
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:45.250
to do all the paperwork to do

3670
02:29:45.250 --> 02:29:46.440
all that but it's a lot easier

3671
02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:48.640
to do -- so I'm gonna kind

3672
02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.190
of wrap up here but I do think

3673
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:52.560
it's important -- in again --

3674
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:53.960
president picker took turned

3675
02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:56.340
us -- that down -- it --

3676
02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:58.730
you know you did that the the

3677
02:29:58.810 --> 02:30:00.390
restart so recent pass a guess

3678
02:30:00.390 --> 02:30:02.200
it is -- what happened in San

3679
02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:04.760
Diego in two thousand one and

3680
02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:06.110
I'm not raising that because

3681
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:07.790
I think the same fax pop up or

3682
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:09.060
anything else it was a different

3683
02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:10.300
time there were different issues

3684
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:12.130
but just understand that there

3685
02:30:12.130 --> 02:30:13.950
are a lot of really good people

3686
02:30:13.950 --> 02:30:15.380
trying to do the right thing and

3687
02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:16.320
believing they were doing right

3688
02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:18.540
circles no one anticipated that

3689
02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:21.280
happening and the people engaged

3690
02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:24.100
in responding to economic

3691
02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:25.730
rational signals the market went

3692
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:27.650
south on them they were dead

3693
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:28.770
that they did not have adequate

3694
02:30:28.770 --> 02:30:30.340
resources to acquire resources

3695
02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:31.970
and also market and they just

3696
02:30:31.970 --> 02:30:33.580
kicked the customers back and

3697
02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:35.020
we played clean up for many many

3698
02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:37.470
years after that so I I what

3699
02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:38.960
I'm suggesting here is is that

3700
02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.240
the time being spent on what

3701
02:30:40.330 --> 02:30:42.490
would plan B. is -- in being

3702
02:30:42.490 --> 02:30:43.770
somewhat cautious in terms of

3703
02:30:43.770 --> 02:30:45.420
how it will be in the future --

3704
02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:47.460
is appropriate because I I I I'm

3705
02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:48.770
not you just anybody it's in the

3706
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:50.200
market right now is trying to do

3707
02:30:50.610 --> 02:30:52.460
anything on toward but there are

3708
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:54.260
a incident forcing circumstances

3709
02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.420
and how all these different

3710
02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.160
pieces -- interact with

3711
02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:59.600
judge are going forward -- --

3712
02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:00.760
could be different than what we

3713
02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:03.400
anticipate -- and so just

3714
02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:04.800
two other points you know

3715
02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:06.400
in the future as we had more

3716
02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:07.960
soul this system are re at the

3717
02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:10.450
reliability today is predicated

3718
02:31:10.450 --> 02:31:12.960
upon a really hot day it's hot

3719
02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:14.230
in the northwest it's hot in

3720
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:15.920
Phoenix and we have to figure

3721
02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.420
out you know how well how we're

3722
02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:19.280
going to meet -- I meet a load

3723
02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:21.050
that's gonna shift as we add

3724
02:31:21.050 --> 02:31:22.590
more solar to that's the best

3725
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:24.200
of a problem with the problem's

3726
02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:25.950
going to be is is winter days

3727
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:27.500
when we don't have a lot of sun

3728
02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:29.110
-- when we may not have a lot of

3729
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:31.300
wind and in what we do that so

3730
02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:33.090
that that's all shifting and it

3731
02:31:33.090 --> 02:31:34.130
and that's not anything that's

3732
02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:35.460
immediate that we need to panic

3733
02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:37.260
about but we need to be mindful

3734
02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:39.530
of it -- so as we go forward the

3735
02:31:39.530 --> 02:31:40.900
main issue that I think we need

3736
02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:42.870
to talk more about and again

3737
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:44.480
I'm going to repeat this what

3738
02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:46.260
California's doing is basically

3739
02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.250
adding clean energy so I don't

3740
02:31:48.250 --> 02:31:49.430
think that's even a dispute

3741
02:31:49.430 --> 02:31:51.010
anymore the real question is

3742
02:31:51.010 --> 02:31:52.960
reliability and affordability

3743
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:54.480
so we be we ought to be at a no

3744
02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.180
stings that enhance reliability

3745
02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:58.630
that that don't break the bank

3746
02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:01.110
-- and -- basically lower

3747
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:03.120
costs for everybody not just

3748
02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:04.660
people putting stuff on their

3749
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:06.350
roads or something stuff in the

3750
02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:08.530
garage -- so the hotel sector

3751
02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:09.920
that Iraq I PP sector that

3752
02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.810
represent -- will work to make

3753
02:32:11.810 --> 02:32:13.570
that attainable and -- we look

3754
02:32:13.570 --> 02:32:15.520
forward to future interaction

3755
02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:17.260
with this committee as the --

3756
02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:19.390
session moves forward thank you

3757
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:22.440
thank you all turn to

3758
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.600
members if they have any

3759
02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:25.950
questions or thank quirk

3760
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:28.990
-- first of all --

3761
02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:32.460
Mister Smarty Jones you hit the

3762
02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:33.940
nail on the head the question

3763
02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:36.210
is reliability and affordability

3764
02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:39.720
-- and -- I'm not quite ready

3765
02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.400
to get ready to utilities yet

3766
02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:42.900
and I will say P. Jeannie was

3767
02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:44.580
forced by the fact that they

3768
02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:47.060
could no longer -- borrow

3769
02:32:47.060 --> 02:32:48.380
money they could no longer get

3770
02:32:48.380 --> 02:32:50.730
cash that wasn't really a choice

3771
02:32:50.730 --> 02:32:52.460
they wanted to make they in

3772
02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:54.380
fact had tried to get funding

3773
02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.220
in the P. use in October in the

3774
02:32:56.220 --> 02:32:58.950
P. you see didn't approve it --

3775
02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:01.090
and had the P. you see frankly

3776
02:33:01.090 --> 02:33:02.940
and I know Mr picker will

3777
02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:04.730
disagree with me but had they

3778
02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:06.230
done something similar to what

3779
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:08.530
was done on the San Bruno case

3780
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:11.210
-- I think we could have avoided

3781
02:33:11.210 --> 02:33:12.880
that however those weren't

3782
02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:14.240
happening and maybe Mister

3783
02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:15.520
pickers right and they couldn't

3784
02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:17.450
have but I don't believe

3785
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:19.710
that but okay anyway getting

3786
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:22.510
back to your situation so

3787
02:33:22.540 --> 02:33:26.070
reliability and cost and

3788
02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:28.510
you know a small and a D.

3789
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:30.700
like Solano county is not

3790
02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:33.350
likely to be able to balance

3791
02:33:33.350 --> 02:33:35.490
everything without having so

3792
02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:37.510
much storage that it becomes

3793
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:39.590
very expensive much like why am

3794
02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:43.090
so we are better off as you said

3795
02:33:43.090 --> 02:33:45.710
when people can get together but

3796
02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:48.720
-- no there is a process

3797
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:50.420
where the I SO looks it

3798
02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:52.300
how they're gonna balance

3799
02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:54.350
load and then the C. P. U.

3800
02:33:54.350 --> 02:33:56.480
C. looks at it how would

3801
02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.570
you -- in vision

3802
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:03.610
the coordination of the with the

3803
02:34:03.610 --> 02:34:05.950
in here I mean you're between

3804
02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:08.070
the I SO in the P. you see we

3805
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:09.480
have an idea of what needs to

3806
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:11.980
be done how do you envision

3807
02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:13.740
that being translated to the

3808
02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:15.550
C. C. A.'s working together

3809
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:21.600
so are you talking specifically

3810
02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:22.910
about the resource adequacy

3811
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:24.720
process of forecasting

3812
02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:26.050
allocation that goes on

3813
02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:27.290
between the cow eyes so

3814
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:28.710
the energy commission

3815
02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:31.550
the CPC yes but also cost

3816
02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.030
because arm I know you have

3817
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:37.130
felt because once you're

3818
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:39.370
looking at getting higher

3819
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.820
levels then you're going to

3820
02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:44.570
have to have --

3821
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:48.460
storage and the cheapest way

3822
02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:49.960
to do that right now is pump

3823
02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:52.430
storage other maintain other

3824
02:34:52.430 --> 02:34:53.840
means maybe batteries will

3825
02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:55.920
get cheaper at cetera but

3826
02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:57.640
the combination of keeping

3827
02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:00.600
prices down and meeting

3828
02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.890
their climate goals and having

3829
02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:04.940
adequate resources is a very

3830
02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:07.790
complex one and no one of

3831
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:09.890
the CCA's is a real can be

3832
02:35:09.890 --> 02:35:11.890
able to balance all of that so

3833
02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:13.760
how do you envision the best

3834
02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:15.960
way is to take the information

3835
02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.930
from those two agencies

3836
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:21.570
get it down into the CCA's then

3837
02:35:21.570 --> 02:35:23.200
who is going to ask this you

3838
02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:26.170
know who's gonna tell CCA axe

3839
02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:27.880
they have to work with C. C. a

3840
02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:30.640
B. and C. C. A. C. and D.

3841
02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:32.540
but you know a doesn't want

3842
02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:34.460
to get involved I mean it it

3843
02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:36.420
becomes quite complex so I'm

3844
02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:37.810
sure you've thought about this

3845
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:39.640
how do you well how would you

3846
02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:42.170
solve this we say to the look

3847
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:43.950
at me go Kelsey CA you can do

3848
02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:45.830
it -- so that's you know part

3849
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:47.470
of our role is this coordination

3850
02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:49.880
of the CCA's on every level

3851
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:52.910
night it's sort of exhausting

3852
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.810
but but it it's exciting --

3853
02:35:54.810 --> 02:35:56.890
so we have an active board

3854
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:59.520
of the operational members

3855
02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:01.500
-- and we have board committees

3856
02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:02.900
we have staff committees

3857
02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.340
very active staff committees

3858
02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:05.660
right down to procurement

3859
02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:08.120
committees that are --

3860
02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:11.190
while observing all anti trust

3861
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:13.860
rules -- are exchanging

3862
02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:16.020
information templates Senate

3863
02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:17.500
offer contract you know ways

3864
02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:18.670
to move forward says a lot

3865
02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:19.770
of collaboration and you see

3866
02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:21.640
it even in Filene's at --

3867
02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:23.490
at the PC they're not all done

3868
02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:24.990
by Kelsey said they'll be joint

3869
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:26.640
CC is the common interests will

3870
02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.850
get together -- go to the A. R.

3871
02:36:28.850 --> 02:36:29.970
B. the folks that are working

3872
02:36:29.970 --> 02:36:31.870
on an electric vehicle programs

3873
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:34.260
and want to have a say there so

3874
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:37.140
so I guess I have to say that

3875
02:36:37.170 --> 02:36:38.520
there is a big coordination

3876
02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.740
state wide there is also

3877
02:36:40.770 --> 02:36:43.190
entities like down in southern

3878
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:44.700
California the California choice

3879
02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:47.370
energy authority who is doing

3880
02:36:47.370 --> 02:36:49.750
work on behalf of -- a whole

3881
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:51.670
lot of the smaller cities and

3882
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:52.760
that's the group I was talking

3883
02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:53.810
about the table to do the

3884
02:36:53.810 --> 02:36:56.500
procurement at at scale --

3885
02:36:56.670 --> 02:36:59.180
to handle some of the data

3886
02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:01.570
management -- services that are

3887
02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:04.150
required so -- I think that

3888
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:06.560
it's evolving I don't see anyone

3889
02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:09.230
CCA my experience is they don't

3890
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:10.320
want to head off on their own

3891
02:37:10.350 --> 02:37:12.100
they show up at our door asking

3892
02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:14.060
for help and information and

3893
02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:15.910
one of the things that I believe

3894
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:17.790
and I have -- just really have

3895
02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:19.090
have the capacity but but I

3896
02:37:19.090 --> 02:37:20.170
think what you know this is

3897
02:37:20.170 --> 02:37:21.290
something that we couldn't work

3898
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:22.230
with the other load serving

3899
02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.860
entities on like the I. O. use

3900
02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:25.230
in terms of helping to educate

3901
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:26.340
and bring these folks on board

3902
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:27.940
I mean I think it is going

3903
02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:29.760
to be these joint CCA's doing

3904
02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:31.310
more activities but also the

3905
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:32.830
example Scott gave the Oakland

3906
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:34.490
energy initiative where the I.

3907
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:36.680
O. U.'s and the CCA partners

3908
02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.560
together to to address some

3909
02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:40.120
of these these tough issues

3910
02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:42.130
I just feel that work at

3911
02:37:43.390 --> 02:37:45.930
this is all great no problem

3912
02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:48.760
but I don't have look

3913
02:37:49.350 --> 02:37:51.190
we lost the governor because

3914
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:53.130
of rolling blackouts and I just

3915
02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:54.340
don't want to see that happen

3916
02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:56.960
again and I just don't see you

3917
02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.570
haven't given me a mechanism

3918
02:37:58.850 --> 02:38:01.350
that is a fail safe and

3919
02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:03.090
I think we need some sort of a

3920
02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:05.740
fail safe mechanism are

3921
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:07.390
given the independence of each

3922
02:38:07.390 --> 02:38:09.740
of the CCA's M. I'll just

3923
02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:11.400
let leave that as an a homework

3924
02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.890
problem for you okay thank you

3925
02:38:16.430 --> 02:38:18.630
structure thank you I want

3926
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:19.950
to pay you back a little bit

3927
02:38:20.350 --> 02:38:22.160
on Mister quirk and I'll do

3928
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:24.370
that a second a first of all

3929
02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:27.980
a Mister Smarty Jones I I I

3930
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:29.980
I do think though that are

3931
02:38:30.910 --> 02:38:32.720
a moral electrons can be

3932
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:34.870
rehabilitated that I want to

3933
02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:36.990
ask a couple questions to about

3934
02:38:37.290 --> 02:38:39.880
that my concern is that

3935
02:38:40.090 --> 02:38:42.330
if we rushed so fast to get

3936
02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.450
out of natural gas we really

3937
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:47.670
lose -- ability for reliability

3938
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:49.390
and I I I think we were all

3939
02:38:49.390 --> 02:38:50.570
very concerned about that

3940
02:38:51.150 --> 02:38:52.830
however there has been some

3941
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:55.610
conversation about --

3942
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:58.230
perhaps renewable natural

3943
02:38:58.230 --> 02:39:00.560
gas what what ask what that

3944
02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:03.520
looks like there's been some

3945
02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.720
talk about hydrogen injected

3946
02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.010
natural gas there's been some

3947
02:39:08.010 --> 02:39:10.150
talk about that and there's been

3948
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:12.410
some talk apparently that these

3949
02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:15.480
can fuel existing for fossil

3950
02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:18.160
fuel plants what is

3951
02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:20.410
that is that realistic is

3952
02:39:20.410 --> 02:39:22.740
there a possibility in it and

3953
02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:25.460
all of this and could perhaps

3954
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:28.340
this be some kind of a fail safe

3955
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:31.030
methodology here aye aye I

3956
02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:33.500
concur with Mister quirk

3957
02:39:34.350 --> 02:39:35.700
I was mayor Fresno in twenty

3958
02:39:35.850 --> 02:39:38.010
and at a night in what nineteen

3959
02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:41.480
the ninety nine two thousand

3960
02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:43.250
two thousand one I live through

3961
02:39:43.810 --> 02:39:45.640
those those blackouts and and

3962
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:47.370
brown outs and I don't ever

3963
02:39:47.370 --> 02:39:49.130
want to live through that again

3964
02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:51.460
and so I'm trying to figure

3965
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:54.290
is there a in term

3966
02:39:54.890 --> 02:39:57.610
more rational more fail

3967
02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:00.410
safe approach to moving

3968
02:40:01.290 --> 02:40:02.740
toward this a hundred

3969
02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:04.600
percent but in the end

3970
02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:06.410
term we do have some steps

3971
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:08.900
that give us increased

3972
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:12.440
levels of reliability

3973
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:14.400
and a fail safe that we

3974
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:17.070
may be able to trust I I'm

3975
02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:20.110
not making no conclusions on

3976
02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.440
asking a question about does

3977
02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:23.890
possibilities right now I'm

3978
02:40:23.890 --> 02:40:25.120
that was respect reliability

3979
02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:26.420
and affordability let let me

3980
02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.040
respond with that based --

3981
02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:29.580
on what I do what I generally

3982
02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:30.600
now because that there there's

3983
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:32.010
some specifics that questions

3984
02:40:32.010 --> 02:40:33.350
there that would take a little

3985
02:40:33.350 --> 02:40:34.690
love for the research for me to

3986
02:40:34.690 --> 02:40:37.150
answer completely -- renewable

3987
02:40:37.150 --> 02:40:38.890
natural gas has been used in

3988
02:40:38.890 --> 02:40:41.120
the system before -- mega and

3989
02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:42.810
as so that's that's something

3990
02:40:42.810 --> 02:40:44.820
that it did could happen -- we

3991
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:47.200
do -- yeah I believe import a

3992
02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:48.630
fair amount of renewable gas

3993
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:49.980
that it was my understanding was

3994
02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:51.710
ending up in -- in the system

3995
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:53.660
as well -- we use actually

3996
02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:54.920
take methane read off the

3997
02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:56.700
landfills and operate them in --

3998
02:40:57.010 --> 02:40:58.780
research reciprocating engines

3999
02:40:58.810 --> 02:41:00.250
-- to produce power but we ran

4000
02:41:00.250 --> 02:41:02.280
into knocks problems there --

4001
02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:05.210
the other thing that the two

4002
02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:06.710
other issues -- renewable

4003
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:08.600
natural gas my understanding

4004
02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:09.930
is is that it tends to be

4005
02:41:09.930 --> 02:41:11.330
significantly more expensive

4006
02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:12.850
than an actual gas we currently

4007
02:41:12.850 --> 02:41:14.090
will currently use for that

4008
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:15.900
so there is a a potential cost

4009
02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:17.340
factor there and the second

4010
02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:19.650
one is it may have a higher

4011
02:41:19.650 --> 02:41:21.600
or better use in other sectors

4012
02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:23.690
of the economy that have less

4013
02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:25.870
-- -- you know -- ability to

4014
02:41:25.870 --> 02:41:27.860
it at to adjust -- you know

4015
02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:29.440
agriculture for it for example

4016
02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:30.740
in terms of food processing

4017
02:41:31.010 --> 02:41:33.950
there may be areas where it

4018
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:35.370
could be better utilized their

4019
02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:36.820
at least I've heard that that

4020
02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:38.780
discussion going on so I don't

4021
02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:40.100
think it's a I don't think the

4022
02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:42.030
answer is no -- but it's it's

4023
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:43.320
I think it's more complicated

4024
02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:44.830
nuanced and and maybe having

4025
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:46.310
additional cut -- readable

4026
02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:48.010
natural gas in the system will

4027
02:41:48.010 --> 02:41:50.080
help alleviate some of a help

4028
02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:52.980
reform the the a moral law --

4029
02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:54.340
select runs that the people

4030
02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:55.960
are concerned with I doubt

4031
02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.140
it but maybe it would help

4032
02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:59.240
-- ameliorate side a problem

4033
02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:01.810
that -- missed questioning the

4034
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.390
thoughts about this as well

4035
02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:07.610
yes No thanks for the question

4036
02:42:07.610 --> 02:42:10.220
so it is it is possible

4037
02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:11.820
to question is to to what

4038
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:14.270
extent so -- a lot of

4039
02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:16.660
modern day power plants have

4040
02:42:16.690 --> 02:42:18.930
very specific -- operating

4041
02:42:18.930 --> 02:42:20.900
requirements and so of the

4042
02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:23.340
renewal natural gas -- something

4043
02:42:23.370 --> 02:42:24.610
you know I know a bit more about

4044
02:42:24.610 --> 02:42:26.290
than that and I did it he's gas

4045
02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:28.560
-- have different he contents

4046
02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:29.950
and moisture content so when you

4047
02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:31.520
planned the there were no other

4048
02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:32.700
no well that's what gas and with

4049
02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:34.190
the with the the record natural

4050
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:35.690
gas you still have to get but

4051
02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:37.140
will call a pipeline quality

4052
02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:38.260
there certain specifications

4053
02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:39.170
that the by points out to

4054
02:42:39.170 --> 02:42:41.290
maintain and if you don't

4055
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:43.410
you're going to avoid the

4056
02:42:43.410 --> 02:42:44.750
manufacturer's warranties on

4057
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:46.930
those power plants so -- it is

4058
02:42:46.930 --> 02:42:48.030
possible it's just it's just

4059
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:49.900
a question of how much can you

4060
02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.200
put into the system before you

4061
02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.320
start to impact certain kinds

4062
02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:54.450
equipment that are that are

4063
02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:56.500
-- more finely tuned -- then

4064
02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.050
dent so your backyard barbecue

4065
02:42:58.950 --> 02:43:01.150
okay -- just when it is cực

4066
02:43:02.530 --> 02:43:03.640
this is a question out

4067
02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:04.420
there answered if you

4068
02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:06.670
wish you don't have to --

4069
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:09.790
my concern is that

4070
02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:11.690
I feel like we're getting the

4071
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:14.010
aspirational element ahead of

4072
02:43:14.010 --> 02:43:15.860
the real reliability and the

4073
02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:18.540
affordability and if in fact as

4074
02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:20.150
has been repeated here that the

4075
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:21.740
reliability and affordability

4076
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:24.050
has to be the lead here or we

4077
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:26.030
have customers and voters who

4078
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:27.650
are going to be very concerned

4079
02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:30.830
about this do we have

4080
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:32.630
a and I asked this of

4081
02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:35.350
anybody on the panels eight

4082
02:43:35.430 --> 02:43:36.990
eight are we satisfied that

4083
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:38.740
there is a process here

4084
02:43:39.090 --> 02:43:41.340
that elevates reliability

4085
02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.570
and affordability above the

4086
02:43:43.570 --> 02:43:45.160
aspiration of the butterfly

4087
02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:50.000
because if we don't I fear

4088
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:50.990
that we end up with the

4089
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:52.380
aspiration driving the

4090
02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:53.720
entire decision making

4091
02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:55.300
and then reliability and

4092
02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:56.740
affordability begin to suffer

4093
02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:00.260
yelp I'll take that your first

4094
02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:02.920
it I think in in elements

4095
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:05.310
we do take into account

4096
02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:07.480
-- reliability affordability

4097
02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:08.840
but it it's not being done in

4098
02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.760
a systematic comprehensive way

4099
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:13.280
of my my biggest concern for

4100
02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:15.250
California right now is we don't

4101
02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:17.060
have a clear vision for how

4102
02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:18.380
we're going to get from today

4103
02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:20.620
to tomorrow of kind of following

4104
02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:22.650
up on on this once in a comment

4105
02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:25.390
of veto it may be an outside

4106
02:44:25.390 --> 02:44:27.720
of some folks but really it it

4107
02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:28.960
would be appropriate to keep the

4108
02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:30.390
gas fired power plants around

4109
02:44:30.390 --> 02:44:31.420
for an extended period time the

4110
02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:32.580
goal should be to reduce the

4111
02:44:32.580 --> 02:44:33.970
amount of natural gas we burn

4112
02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:35.500
them by ideally let's try not

4113
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.010
to burn any gas in those power

4114
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:38.560
plants and once we can assure

4115
02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:39.990
ourselves that the system can

4116
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:41.190
operate without the natural gas

4117
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:42.580
fired power plants then we can

4118
02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:44.610
retire them -- but we should

4119
02:44:44.610 --> 02:44:45.780
be opposed to just having them

4120
02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:47.040
there there like a backyard you

4121
02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.460
know a generator -- for people

4122
02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:51.830
that have -- a critical needs

4123
02:44:52.090 --> 02:44:54.320
so that that should be the the

4124
02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:56.210
focal point in in doing it then

4125
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:57.310
we can allow the technology

4126
02:44:57.310 --> 02:44:59.150
curve to evolve over time so the

4127
02:44:59.150 --> 02:45:00.940
race to get all the clean stuff

4128
02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:03.230
on very quickly -- communicate

4129
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:04.680
very big bet on today's

4130
02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:06.190
technologies and there may

4131
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:07.310
be some breakthroughs to come

4132
02:45:07.310 --> 02:45:09.390
along that will afford you know

4133
02:45:09.390 --> 02:45:11.500
allow us to leverage much more

4134
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.930
affordable ways of generating

4135
02:45:12.930 --> 02:45:14.560
electricity so it should just

4136
02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.500
be very measured approach to

4137
02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:19.070
-- -- to reducing carbon in

4138
02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:21.430
our an electric sector of in

4139
02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:22.770
and remember electric sector

4140
02:45:22.770 --> 02:45:25.010
is is just less than twenty

4141
02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:25.950
percent of the total carbon

4142
02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:28.500
emissions in California we we we

4143
02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:30.700
want to use -- electricity to

4144
02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:33.700
electrify transportation and

4145
02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.010
and buildings which is more than

4146
02:45:35.010 --> 02:45:36.840
half the the carbon emissions so

4147
02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:39.360
if we if we rates to try to get

4148
02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:41.260
all the carbon out electricity

4149
02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:42.860
and raise the price maybe make

4150
02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:44.610
it less reliable we are going

4151
02:45:44.610 --> 02:45:45.680
or seriously jeopardize our

4152
02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:47.050
ability get people wanna buy

4153
02:45:47.050 --> 02:45:48.740
electric cars and and electrify

4154
02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.640
their their their property so

4155
02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:52.480
-- just needs to be done very

4156
02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:55.140
thoughtfully and -- in in

4157
02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:56.350
unfortunately because it's such

4158
02:45:56.350 --> 02:45:58.210
a such a involve complicated

4159
02:45:58.210 --> 02:46:00.960
situation -- in our regulatory

4160
02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:02.040
and let's say process he's like

4161
02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.700
to look at things in silos it's

4162
02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:04.920
really difficult to cut across

4163
02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:06.640
all the different -- -- --

4164
02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:08.010
dimensions that are in play here

4165
02:46:09.930 --> 02:46:11.550
I think up don't speak for

4166
02:46:11.550 --> 02:46:13.740
the chair but we've had some

4167
02:46:13.740 --> 02:46:14.950
conversations about this

4168
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:16.930
that one of the things we

4169
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:19.490
hope for at it is that and

4170
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:20.460
then I don't think that we've

4171
02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:21.720
had this in the six years

4172
02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:23.390
that I've been here and on

4173
02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:25.470
this committee which is a

4174
02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:29.290
long serious look at the kinds

4175
02:46:29.290 --> 02:46:31.150
of policies necessary to get

4176
02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:33.320
where we want to in a in a

4177
02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:35.680
in a careful and coordinated

4178
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:38.120
way moving forward it is the

4179
02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:40.480
haphazard approach and the

4180
02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.010
wishful thinking approach that

4181
02:46:43.010 --> 02:46:45.820
concerns me -- and I

4182
02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:48.810
I hope we could see this open

4183
02:46:48.810 --> 02:46:51.200
door as a as an opportunity to

4184
02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:53.270
really have serious discussions

4185
02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:55.540
about how do we get to where we

4186
02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:57.860
want to be and not be in

4187
02:46:57.860 --> 02:46:59.020
such a rush to get there

4188
02:46:59.050 --> 02:47:00.140
that we are willing to have

4189
02:47:00.140 --> 02:47:01.790
a step by step fought full

4190
02:47:02.170 --> 02:47:04.640
process that -- gets us to

4191
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:05.710
where we want to get to but

4192
02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:07.460
does not as I think Mr quirk

4193
02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:10.280
suggest risk the

4194
02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:13.720
the trustworthiness of the

4195
02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:14.890
people California and what

4196
02:47:14.890 --> 02:47:16.720
we're about thank you Mister

4197
02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:19.670
thank you script

4198
02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:22.750
thank you Mister chairman thank

4199
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:24.600
you panelists I'm I'm actually

4200
02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:26.110
very excited about what the

4201
02:47:26.110 --> 02:47:27.680
future of California looks like

4202
02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:29.050
-- I'm new to this committee

4203
02:47:29.050 --> 02:47:31.090
but I'm have a lot of questions

4204
02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:32.970
-- and I apologize that I had

4205
02:47:32.970 --> 02:47:34.000
to miss a portion of it as

4206
02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.920
I was at another and another

4207
02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:38.710
committee as we lead towards --

4208
02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:40.950
a row to de carbonization and

4209
02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:42.270
renewable energy at one hundred

4210
02:47:42.270 --> 02:47:44.200
percent I want to echo Mister

4211
02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:45.990
Patterson thoughts on how we

4212
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:47.560
get there but I'm looking at

4213
02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:48.410
it through a very different

4214
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:49.760
perspective as well not only

4215
02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:51.520
on the consumer points but also

4216
02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:53.810
on the labor front and so I'd

4217
02:47:53.810 --> 02:47:55.130
be curious and I don't know if

4218
02:47:55.130 --> 02:47:56.480
we've had these conversations

4219
02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:58.590
in the past or what information

4220
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:59.980
is available when it comes to

4221
02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:01.210
certain types of energy and

4222
02:48:01.210 --> 02:48:02.730
what that what the future work

4223
02:48:02.730 --> 02:48:04.200
force of California looks like

4224
02:48:04.570 --> 02:48:06.350
I represent a district that is

4225
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:09.000
twenty percent below the

4226
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.950
national poverty line in Los

4227
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:13.710
Angeles in the main urban area

4228
02:48:14.290 --> 02:48:15.190
and I want to put people to

4229
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:17.980
work but I'm not quite sure

4230
02:48:18.180 --> 02:48:20.400
what that work is or what those

4231
02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:21.580
apprenticeship programs look

4232
02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:23.270
like or what the partners are

4233
02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:26.170
in if we are going to create a

4234
02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:28.480
a pathway to one hundred percent

4235
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:30.360
did I mention there's also an

4236
02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:31.820
opportunity to create really

4237
02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.970
incredible jobs for people and

4238
02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:35.340
so how do we get there I think

4239
02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:37.720
there's a those are two items

4240
02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:38.870
that are not mutually exclusive

4241
02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.480
and so you can have one without

4242
02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:43.210
the other and so if there's any

4243
02:48:43.210 --> 02:48:45.240
ideas at the table from from

4244
02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:47.130
the industry or from partners

4245
02:48:47.130 --> 02:48:48.760
and stakeholders that we can

4246
02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:50.260
talk about not only how do we

4247
02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:51.600
get the policy to get us to

4248
02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:52.930
one hundred percent renewable

4249
02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:54.970
but what is the work that

4250
02:48:54.970 --> 02:48:57.040
needs to happen with actual

4251
02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.030
people to make sure that that

4252
02:48:59.030 --> 02:49:01.080
happens insult thoughts or

4253
02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:02.640
opinions whether now or later

4254
02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:04.350
are very welcome thank you

4255
02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:09.750
I'll just grab that for the

4256
02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:11.620
moment I I think you're raising

4257
02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:13.300
a agreed issue and one thing

4258
02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:14.910
I would say about communities

4259
02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:16.760
-- that have moved towards

4260
02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:18.060
community choice aggregation

4261
02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:19.240
a for many of them it was a

4262
02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:20.780
way to implement their climate

4263
02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:22.770
action plans but it's also about

4264
02:49:22.770 --> 02:49:25.230
jobs in the community and so I

4265
02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:26.230
think that's what we're seeing

4266
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:27.800
in terms of particularly and

4267
02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:29.030
I can provide you with a lot

4268
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:30.500
of examples of follow up with

4269
02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:32.330
you but some of the examples --

4270
02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:33.990
from CCA's that have been up and

4271
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:35.220
running for awhile and have some

4272
02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:36.910
of these programs and it goes to

4273
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:37.880
I think appoint Mister Christian

4274
02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:39.610
made about the electrification a

4275
02:49:39.610 --> 02:49:40.890
lot of them have this real goal

4276
02:49:40.890 --> 02:49:42.440
of impacting electrification

4277
02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:44.320
of transportation and buildings

4278
02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:45.390
and there there are jobs in

4279
02:49:45.390 --> 02:49:47.710
here and there there are jobs

4280
02:49:47.710 --> 02:49:49.690
in terms of -- some of the local

4281
02:49:49.690 --> 02:49:51.130
renewable programs but they

4282
02:49:51.130 --> 02:49:52.690
may come and go right and what

4283
02:49:52.690 --> 02:49:53.890
you're looking for is something

4284
02:49:53.890 --> 02:49:56.480
that -- is is this for it so

4285
02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:58.700
-- yeah I would love to talk

4286
02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:00.200
about this more later but I

4287
02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:01.360
think of in particular like

4288
02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:03.390
San Jose clean energy and the

4289
02:50:03.390 --> 02:50:04.800
reasons why they've made this

4290
02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:07.110
move -- the meristem a cart

4291
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:08.600
is been very outspoken on this

4292
02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:09.920
because he is such a diverse

4293
02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:12.600
-- -- based and and want to

4294
02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:14.510
to make sure that -- jobs

4295
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:15.750
are part of of what they're

4296
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:17.450
bringing to the community so

4297
02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.280
and just very quickly --

4298
02:50:22.310 --> 02:50:24.040
assembly woman are Darcy -- out

4299
02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:25.470
all arranged to have somebody

4300
02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:27.000
reach us give me I'm sorry

4301
02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:29.700
thank you god but my

4302
02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:32.470
apology this group -- the

4303
02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:35.710
will -- get somebody

4304
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:37.630
to ask can I connect with you

4305
02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:39.100
talk about the job programs

4306
02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:40.180
at southern California Edison

4307
02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:42.710
house a lot of jobs

4308
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:44.040
there are ultimately are in

4309
02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:45.230
the stem fields right it's

4310
02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:46.790
about developing -- yet

4311
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:48.280
it's the engineering and and

4312
02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:50.590
that then the field the the

4313
02:50:50.590 --> 02:50:51.480
field engineering work that

4314
02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.780
goes on -- destined gives

4315
02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:55.380
a number of twenty thousand

4316
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:56.350
dollars scholarship to your to

4317
02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:57.880
underserved communities -- in

4318
02:50:57.880 --> 02:50:59.350
the stem field and one make sure

4319
02:50:59.350 --> 02:51:00.390
that you're aware of that and

4320
02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:02.380
and have your -- your students

4321
02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:03.780
applying for those scholarships

4322
02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:06.020
but there's also a lot of craft

4323
02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:07.640
-- labor that the company --

4324
02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:09.340
employees and then off to the

4325
02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:10.500
construction of these projects

4326
02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:12.190
leads to jobs but not the

4327
02:51:12.190 --> 02:51:13.310
construction is sort of a one

4328
02:51:13.310 --> 02:51:15.030
time a job and then and then

4329
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:17.210
it moves on so -- definitely

4330
02:51:17.210 --> 02:51:18.070
think there's opportunities

4331
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:19.710
for the communities and -- and

4332
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:21.140
all all of the stakeholders

4333
02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:22.170
to partner in this regard

4334
02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:28.620
I'll just make a couple of a

4335
02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.900
couple of points -- so one I

4336
02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:32.650
think the programs developed by

4337
02:51:32.650 --> 02:51:33.980
the public utilities commission

4338
02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:35.270
under the California solar

4339
02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:36.810
initiative and then -- and

4340
02:51:36.810 --> 02:51:38.810
then the extension the solar

4341
02:51:38.810 --> 02:51:39.960
and multiple multi family

4342
02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:41.570
affordable homes have some

4343
02:51:41.570 --> 02:51:43.500
elements of job training I mean

4344
02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:44.610
it's well it's the relatively

4345
02:51:44.610 --> 02:51:45.730
small programs in the grand

4346
02:51:45.810 --> 02:51:47.270
scheme of things but it's a good

4347
02:51:47.270 --> 02:51:49.620
model for -- using those

4348
02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.000
programs to try to leverage

4349
02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.200
some workforce development

4350
02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:53.870
and make sure that their

4351
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:56.740
opportunities in those areas for

4352
02:51:57.690 --> 02:51:59.420
jobs in urban areas me a lot

4353
02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:01.560
of -- and and I'm not anyway

4354
02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:03.760
dismissing the the need and

4355
02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:04.970
the long run for large scale

4356
02:52:04.970 --> 02:52:07.630
renewables but a lot

4357
02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:08.760
of that development is fairly

4358
02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:10.230
remote and to employ people

4359
02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:12.460
in dense urban areas like San

4360
02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:15.370
Diego or center there LA

4361
02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:17.330
you are necessarily looking at

4362
02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:18.360
development more distributed

4363
02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.220
resources and energy efficiency

4364
02:52:20.570 --> 02:52:22.540
-- so potentially a lot of

4365
02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:24.850
jobs the latest to solar jobs

4366
02:52:24.850 --> 02:52:26.740
report I believe -- had a

4367
02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:28.410
number around seventy thousand

4368
02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:30.980
-- and -- jobs in California

4369
02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:32.330
in the solar industry broadly

4370
02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:34.460
-- one thing that would help

4371
02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:35.510
and the Los Angeles area in

4372
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:37.380
particular we have we at council

4373
02:52:37.430 --> 02:52:39.930
have begun to to work more

4374
02:52:39.930 --> 02:52:42.850
intensively with LA W. P. which

4375
02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:44.310
hasn't a Taurus the difficult

4376
02:52:44.310 --> 02:52:45.910
interconnection process that

4377
02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:47.220
makes sewer development storage

4378
02:52:47.220 --> 02:52:48.910
development and LA for difficult

4379
02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:50.750
and it's -- we think really

4380
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:52.450
holding back the market so

4381
02:52:52.450 --> 02:52:53.870
it's removing those kinds of

4382
02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:55.850
barriers and then preparing

4383
02:52:55.850 --> 02:52:58.390
for increases in DVRs -- within

4384
02:52:58.390 --> 02:52:59.650
those are in areas making sure

4385
02:52:59.650 --> 02:53:01.390
the work forces there we --

4386
02:53:01.390 --> 02:53:03.770
would love to cooperate with you

4387
02:53:03.770 --> 02:53:06.330
and and folks in LA and mayor

4388
02:53:06.330 --> 02:53:07.620
Garcetti's recent now spent

4389
02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:09.340
that he wants to eliminate the

4390
02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:10.600
reliance on three gas fired

4391
02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:12.800
power plants there is a large

4392
02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:14.640
local reliability value that

4393
02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:17.110
those plans provide and -- that

4394
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:19.370
will necessitate of a

4395
02:53:19.370 --> 02:53:20.820
very comprehensive and thorough

4396
02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:23.320
look at what the ours can do

4397
02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:24.530
to replace that and provide

4398
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:26.320
equivalent reliability service

4399
02:53:26.350 --> 02:53:28.730
there's it will necessitate much

4400
02:53:28.730 --> 02:53:30.200
more development in the LA area

4401
02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:36.880
I thank you for for that --

4402
02:53:37.950 --> 02:53:39.630
as periodic comet

4403
02:53:40.470 --> 02:53:41.980
in a world transition your

4404
02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:43.480
comment into public common we

4405
02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:45.560
appreciate those who were some

4406
02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:47.200
a member Carillo have good news

4407
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:49.490
and bad news now I have before I

4408
02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:55.890
take your pick idea before I

4409
02:53:55.890 --> 02:53:57.630
came to the P. you see I spent

4410
02:53:57.880 --> 02:53:59.620
a number of years working on

4411
02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:01.200
citing permitting and helping

4412
02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:02.750
to interconnect very large

4413
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:04.080
renewable energy projects

4414
02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:05.540
in this is Mister Marcia was

4415
02:54:05.540 --> 02:54:07.830
saying a lot of those were

4416
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:10.140
remote but the filled a need

4417
02:54:10.470 --> 02:54:11.930
at a time that the housing

4418
02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:13.840
industry was in collapse in the

4419
02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:15.010
commercial building industry

4420
02:54:15.010 --> 02:54:16.230
was in collapsed because of

4421
02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:18.300
a lot of construction workers

4422
02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:19.480
because a lot of this work is

4423
02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:22.010
actually construction do travel

4424
02:54:22.090 --> 02:54:23.480
they follow they follow the

4425
02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:25.460
construction trends so at one

4426
02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:27.020
point weeks week we've we've

4427
02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:28.850
we counted about thirty five

4428
02:54:28.850 --> 02:54:31.480
thousand people working on

4429
02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:34.400
various -- desert and Central

4430
02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.360
Valley renewable energy projects

4431
02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:39.000
that was pretty important for

4432
02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:40.610
particularly those people who

4433
02:54:40.610 --> 02:54:42.430
are in the organized trades it

4434
02:54:42.430 --> 02:54:44.550
was impossible to find anybody

4435
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:46.820
any any union hiring hall any

4436
02:54:46.820 --> 02:54:49.020
place in the Inland Empire for

4437
02:54:49.020 --> 02:54:50.300
a large period of time because

4438
02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:51.940
they are all out working and

4439
02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:53.620
that created a lot of family

4440
02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:55.890
wealth but what it didn't really

4441
02:54:55.890 --> 02:54:57.590
result in what was a lot of

4442
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:59.850
long term prosperity and long

4443
02:54:59.850 --> 02:55:01.880
term jobs in that particular

4444
02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:03.820
sector what we've seen in the

4445
02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:06.080
solar industry is that a lot

4446
02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:07.390
of the work was actually an

4447
02:55:07.390 --> 02:55:09.450
origination in the soft parts

4448
02:55:09.450 --> 02:55:11.390
of the job so I meant going

4449
02:55:11.390 --> 02:55:13.230
door to door finding customers

4450
02:55:13.650 --> 02:55:15.670
with the most recent statistics

4451
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:17.900
is in California is the jobs

4452
02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:19.060
in the solar industry of

4453
02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.440
chop dropped by fifty percent

4454
02:55:21.730 --> 02:55:24.100
because they're sort of a a

4455
02:55:24.210 --> 02:55:26.570
a a attenuation in the market

4456
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:29.200
place so I'm I'm why

4457
02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:31.740
worry that we rely too much on

4458
02:55:31.770 --> 02:55:34.430
energy policy is jobs policy

4459
02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:36.380
if you're if there are jobs

4460
02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:37.670
that are going to be long term

4461
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:38.790
and persistent is going to

4462
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:41.230
be where you have a very firm

4463
02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:42.980
infrastructure that needs a lot

4464
02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:44.900
of servicing so I keep pointing

4465
02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:47.540
people towards union blind work

4466
02:55:48.130 --> 02:55:50.300
and said that is probably why

4467
02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:51.520
there's going to be the most

4468
02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:53.900
jobs with quality longevity

4469
02:55:54.170 --> 02:55:56.510
they both creek -- family wealth

4470
02:55:56.720 --> 02:55:58.220
and because the polls don't

4471
02:55:58.220 --> 02:56:00.280
move around unlike construction

4472
02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:01.570
they'll probably be more

4473
02:56:01.570 --> 02:56:03.370
community prosperity building

4474
02:56:03.370 --> 02:56:04.980
as a result of it and I think we

4475
02:56:04.980 --> 02:56:06.570
have to be very thoughtful about

4476
02:56:06.570 --> 02:56:08.240
these things and really analyze

4477
02:56:08.370 --> 02:56:09.930
what are the jobs we want in

4478
02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:11.520
the future what's the nature

4479
02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.600
of our energy construction I

4480
02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.300
just don't think that energy

4481
02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:16.840
policy is automatically a

4482
02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:19.130
good jobs and an income policy

4483
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:23.930
thank you for that we'll

4484
02:56:23.930 --> 02:56:25.150
turn to public comment we

4485
02:56:25.150 --> 02:56:27.260
appreciate the panel for their

4486
02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:29.340
participation there inside

4487
02:56:39.970 --> 02:56:40.390
okay

4488
02:56:47.010 --> 02:56:48.230
good afternoon -- my name's

4489
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:49.780
Melissa brown on behalf of East

4490
02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:51.450
Bay community energy which is

4491
02:56:51.450 --> 02:56:53.350
a C. CA serving Alameda county

4492
02:56:53.350 --> 02:56:55.760
and eleven of its cities -- to

4493
02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:57.560
address -- is Carillo questions

4494
02:56:57.560 --> 02:56:58.730
about jobs they did want to

4495
02:56:58.730 --> 02:57:00.890
point out that one of A. B. C.'s

4496
02:57:00.890 --> 02:57:02.840
core goals is to invest in local

4497
02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:04.650
development and we in fact have

4498
02:57:04.650 --> 02:57:06.030
a local development business

4499
02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:07.260
plan that was developed with

4500
02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:08.850
our board and stakeholders over

4501
02:57:08.850 --> 02:57:10.290
the course of more than a year

4502
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:12.590
-- to outline how we plan to do

4503
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:14.410
that be happy to share copy with

4504
02:57:14.410 --> 02:57:16.760
you if you're interested okay

4505
02:57:16.810 --> 02:57:18.070
that we also have prevailing

4506
02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:19.330
wage language and our long

4507
02:57:19.330 --> 02:57:21.050
term renewables contracts and

4508
02:57:21.050 --> 02:57:22.730
we expect that our investments

4509
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:24.000
will result in project labor

4510
02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.760
agreements so there are multiple

4511
02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:27.460
ways that we expect that our

4512
02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:29.100
activities will result in job

4513
02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:30.740
creation and sustaining jobs

4514
02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:32.950
as well in their local area --

4515
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:35.020
I also wanted to address the

4516
02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:36.860
concerns and questions raised

4517
02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:38.240
by Mister Patterson and Mr

4518
02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:40.310
quirk regarding reliability

4519
02:57:40.310 --> 02:57:42.390
and affordability -- from an

4520
02:57:42.390 --> 02:57:43.740
affordability perspective I

4521
02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:44.980
would just say our local board

4522
02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:46.330
is committed to low rates in

4523
02:57:46.330 --> 02:57:47.630
this puts a lot of pressure on

4524
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:48.880
our procurement team to make

4525
02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:49.940
sure they're entering into

4526
02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:52.440
affordable transactions markets

4527
02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:54.050
can work to coordinate low

4528
02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:55.770
cost procurement that maximizes

4529
02:57:55.770 --> 02:57:57.510
value if the rules are set up

4530
02:57:57.510 --> 02:58:00.190
correctly and -- we get signals

4531
02:58:00.190 --> 02:58:01.700
from the market that enable

4532
02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:03.430
us to ascertain and value our

4533
02:58:03.430 --> 02:58:04.820
resources and decide what we're

4534
02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:06.840
going to invest in -- that can

4535
02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:08.330
fall apart when the regulatory

4536
02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:10.060
rules are unpredictable or

4537
02:58:10.060 --> 02:58:12.540
poorly designed and so that's

4538
02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:13.450
part of what we're trying to

4539
02:58:13.450 --> 02:58:15.390
work through with the si PC to

4540
02:58:15.390 --> 02:58:17.230
make sure that the rules are

4541
02:58:17.230 --> 02:58:18.980
adopted to today's landscape

4542
02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:20.710
in a way that set us up to

4543
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:22.190
be able to maximize the value

4544
02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:24.090
of the system at least cost

4545
02:58:24.410 --> 02:58:25.840
-- and just wanted to point

4546
02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:26.930
out that they're kind of two

4547
02:58:26.930 --> 02:58:28.870
competing proposals at the PC

4548
02:58:29.100 --> 02:58:31.330
regarding how to and -- ensure

4549
02:58:31.330 --> 02:58:33.150
reliability as Matt one is a

4550
02:58:33.150 --> 02:58:34.850
residual central procurement

4551
02:58:34.960 --> 02:58:37.070
-- system and another one is a

4552
02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:39.020
full procurement system under

4553
02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:41.060
residual procurement system you

4554
02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:43.110
give LSE's the right incentives

4555
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:45.620
to maintain some of the clean

4556
02:58:45.620 --> 02:58:46.720
investments that they're trying

4557
02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:48.520
to make such as energy storage

4558
02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:50.500
while still having a backstop

4559
02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:52.050
to ensure that the lights don't

4560
02:58:52.050 --> 02:58:54.620
go out so -- direct response

4561
02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:55.890
to Mr quirk as that's how you

4562
02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:57.020
make sure the lights don't go

4563
02:58:57.020 --> 02:58:59.270
out a full procurement system

4564
02:58:59.550 --> 02:59:01.080
may accomplish the same goal

4565
02:59:01.080 --> 02:59:02.370
of the lights not going out

4566
02:59:02.370 --> 02:59:03.680
but may do so in a way that

4567
02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:05.270
really inhibit our ability to

4568
02:59:05.270 --> 02:59:07.800
invest in the right clean --

4569
02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:09.810
source as self maybe with that

4570
02:59:09.810 --> 02:59:10.880
thought thank you very much

4571
02:59:17.280 --> 02:59:18.600
is chairman Toni Braun about

4572
02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:19.910
half the California misplayed

4573
02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:21.580
Khiladi says he Asian the state

4574
02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:23.420
wide association public power

4575
02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:26.140
in California -- reliability

4576
02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:28.300
is the paramount -- goal of

4577
02:59:28.300 --> 02:59:29.680
public power entities that is

4578
02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.400
reflected in our long history

4579
02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:33.450
of ownership of generation

4580
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:35.520
and as long and are reversed

4581
02:59:35.550 --> 02:59:37.460
-- practices for long term

4582
02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:38.990
contracting with generation make

4583
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:41.120
sure that we keep the lights

4584
02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:42.420
on for our customer owners in

4585
02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:44.070
our in our community citizens

4586
02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:46.330
I think it's important as we

4587
02:59:46.330 --> 02:59:48.060
consider all this issues in

4588
02:59:48.060 --> 02:59:49.710
the immense complexity of it

4589
02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:51.500
to recognize that we're not

4590
02:59:51.580 --> 02:59:53.220
writing on a blank slate here

4591
02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:55.190
the legislature is already

4592
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:57.670
legislated -- at the to lease

4593
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:59.400
code requires that load serving

4594
02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:01.600
entities not only maintain

4595
03:00:01.650 --> 03:00:03.690
adequate supplies to meet load

4596
03:00:04.330 --> 03:00:06.780
but also for -- forward planning

4597
03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:08.970
obligations it out in the I. R.

4598
03:00:08.970 --> 03:00:10.950
P. provisions in the utilities

4599
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:12.720
code all the load serving

4600
03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:13.940
entities and that's most of the

4601
03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:15.640
larger PPO use as well as the

4602
03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:17.360
CPUC jurisdictional entities

4603
03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:19.730
have to file I are peas and in

4604
03:00:19.730 --> 03:00:22.280
the entire P. demonstrations

4605
03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:23.420
of how they're meeting their

4606
03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:24.790
load serving obligations and

4607
03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:26.390
planning for reserves must

4608
03:00:26.390 --> 03:00:28.030
be part of those documents so

4609
03:00:28.030 --> 03:00:29.400
fortunately we're not making

4610
03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:30.670
this up out of whole cloth

4611
03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:31.950
we've already thought a little

4612
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:33.700
bit about these issues and I

4613
03:00:33.700 --> 03:00:34.880
would think building on what

4614
03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:36.310
we've already put in the in

4615
03:00:36.310 --> 03:00:37.900
place in the statute and on

4616
03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:39.050
the ground it would seem to

4617
03:00:39.050 --> 03:00:40.890
get prudent -- place to start

4618
03:00:41.730 --> 03:00:43.720
so we have PO use over twenty

4619
03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:45.560
that are in the I SO and

4620
03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:47.780
they set their own planning

4621
03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:49.820
reserve margins as dictated

4622
03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:51.940
with in the context of the

4623
03:00:51.940 --> 03:00:54.140
state requirements but

4624
03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:55.510
that's only part of the story

4625
03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:58.790
there each year they get local

4626
03:00:58.790 --> 03:01:00.720
capacity obligations that

4627
03:01:00.750 --> 03:01:03.170
are allocated to them by the

4628
03:01:03.790 --> 03:01:06.590
I SO and they get flexible

4629
03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:08.210
capacity obligation so we've

4630
03:01:08.210 --> 03:01:09.380
heard a lot about local

4631
03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:10.920
capacity obligations and the

4632
03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:12.200
thorny Nessa's associate with

4633
03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:14.730
procurement local capacity this

4634
03:01:14.730 --> 03:01:16.450
is been going on for a decade

4635
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:19.300
many of the P. a user smaller

4636
03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.430
much smaller than the CCA's

4637
03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:24.060
they have been able to meet

4638
03:01:24.060 --> 03:01:25.700
the local capacity obligations

4639
03:01:25.700 --> 03:01:27.860
that the I SO directs and the

4640
03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:29.540
flexible capacity obligations

4641
03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:31.980
that the I SO directs --

4642
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:34.910
the if they don't the I SO

4643
03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:36.270
goes out and has backstopped

4644
03:01:36.270 --> 03:01:37.750
procurement so where is the

4645
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:39.220
safety net we've heard that

4646
03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:40.770
with respect to the PO using

4647
03:01:40.770 --> 03:01:42.570
the I SO if they do not meet

4648
03:01:42.570 --> 03:01:43.770
their obligations which are

4649
03:01:43.770 --> 03:01:46.380
defined by the ISO the I SO will

4650
03:01:46.380 --> 03:01:48.520
go out and if there's a

4651
03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:51.390
shortfall -- do the procurement

4652
03:01:51.690 --> 03:01:53.080
and allocate those entities

4653
03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:55.070
the cost so again we're not on

4654
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:57.030
a blank slate here we have a

4655
03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:59.030
-- we have a system in place

4656
03:02:00.450 --> 03:02:01.410
the P. you use that are not

4657
03:02:01.410 --> 03:02:03.180
in the eyes so they're subject

4658
03:02:03.180 --> 03:02:05.110
to the same obligations to

4659
03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:06.710
meet load and resources in

4660
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:08.560
a real time basis as Mister

4661
03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:10.220
ruff leader described so

4662
03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:11.540
if they don't do that they

4663
03:02:11.540 --> 03:02:13.360
violate various standards

4664
03:02:13.390 --> 03:02:15.160
ants are subject to incredibly

4665
03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:16.580
rigorous financial penalties

4666
03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:18.340
are forced through the federal

4667
03:02:18.340 --> 03:02:19.630
energy regulatory commission

4668
03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:22.340
ultimately so they have a

4669
03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:23.820
great incentive in you and you

4670
03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:25.210
see that reflected in their

4671
03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:27.990
in their planning practices

4672
03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:31.050
so what we have put

4673
03:02:31.050 --> 03:02:33.180
in place as Mister Smarty Jones

4674
03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:35.360
indicated has worked pretty well

4675
03:02:35.730 --> 03:02:36.930
is it a little frayed around the

4676
03:02:36.930 --> 03:02:38.550
edges because of the challenges

4677
03:02:38.550 --> 03:02:39.690
that we've talked about today

4678
03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:42.420
there's no doubt about that --

4679
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:44.190
fortunately we're not starting

4680
03:02:44.350 --> 03:02:45.870
from a system where we had three

4681
03:02:45.870 --> 03:02:47.180
loads serving entities and now

4682
03:02:47.180 --> 03:02:49.030
we're gonna have over fifty the

4683
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:50.660
I SO indicated in a filing it

4684
03:02:50.660 --> 03:02:52.070
made it for earlier this year

4685
03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:54.500
late last year that there are

4686
03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:56.610
forty load serving entities that

4687
03:02:56.610 --> 03:02:58.460
currently deals with in its own

4688
03:02:58.460 --> 03:03:00.140
resource adequacy regime right

4689
03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:02.000
now so we're starting from a

4690
03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:03.490
much higher number than three

4691
03:03:04.530 --> 03:03:06.710
and but we're going to greater

4692
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:08.150
to segregation and we also

4693
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:09.630
have the behind your challenges

4694
03:03:09.630 --> 03:03:11.110
and things like that so we

4695
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:12.640
absolutely need think fought

4696
03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:14.420
fully about what we're putting

4697
03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:16.580
in place going forward --

4698
03:03:16.610 --> 03:03:17.830
but I would urge the committee

4699
03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:19.220
as we look at these things not

4700
03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:20.350
to throw the baby out with the

4701
03:03:20.350 --> 03:03:22.050
bath water I think there are

4702
03:03:22.050 --> 03:03:23.430
some targeted things that we

4703
03:03:23.430 --> 03:03:25.780
know we need to solve the

4704
03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:27.770
particularly the low hanging

4705
03:03:27.770 --> 03:03:30.170
fruit associated with that it's

4706
03:03:30.170 --> 03:03:31.920
fairly discrete number of local

4707
03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:33.580
resources that we know are

4708
03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:35.620
needed to keep the lights on --

4709
03:03:35.620 --> 03:03:37.170
and probably need a a forward

4710
03:03:37.170 --> 03:03:39.030
looking revenue stream to make

4711
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:40.570
sure that they're staying around

4712
03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:42.930
-- there's a lot that we can do

4713
03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:45.690
-- the cheapest flexible

4714
03:03:45.690 --> 03:03:47.720
resource is not the multi

4715
03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:49.160
billion dollar project we might

4716
03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:51.030
build in the future it's the

4717
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:52.540
gas plants that are in the

4718
03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:54.660
ground right now and we need to

4719
03:03:54.690 --> 03:03:56.770
make sure that we as we move to

4720
03:03:56.770 --> 03:03:59.030
the D. carbonization and a low

4721
03:03:59.030 --> 03:04:00.600
carbon future or the zero carbon

4722
03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.610
future that we make sure that we

4723
03:04:02.610 --> 03:04:05.540
maintain that safety net --

4724
03:04:06.450 --> 03:04:08.100
to ensure that we keep the a

4725
03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:10.940
grade a stable and secure

4726
03:04:11.230 --> 03:04:12.580
as we meet our energy policy

4727
03:04:12.580 --> 03:04:14.020
goals so we know it's gonna

4728
03:04:14.020 --> 03:04:15.210
be a long conversation we

4729
03:04:15.210 --> 03:04:15.930
look forward to working

4730
03:04:15.930 --> 03:04:17.230
with the committee thank you

4731
03:04:17.340 --> 03:04:18.190
thank you for your comments

4732
03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:21.080
good afternoon Mister

4733
03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:23.900
chairman and member yes

4734
03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:25.670
over there in with their others

4735
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:27.800
watching there are welcome

4736
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:29.410
-- that Lee is over there with

4737
03:04:29.410 --> 03:04:31.990
cal chamber -- reliability

4738
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:33.190
and affordability are some

4739
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:34.360
of the primary concerns of

4740
03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:35.720
our fourteen thousand member

4741
03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:37.040
businesses that we do really

4742
03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:38.280
appreciate you holding this

4743
03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:39.380
hearing before we start

4744
03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:40.760
considering all these bills this

4745
03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:42.960
year -- we do remain concerned

4746
03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:44.000
regarding legislation that

4747
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.590
seeks to improve it to impose

4748
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:47.310
mandates to procure one energy

4749
03:04:47.310 --> 03:04:49.020
technology over another spend

4750
03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:50.440
millions of dollars on climate

4751
03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:51.680
programs that may or may not be

4752
03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:53.640
effective at reducing emissions

4753
03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:55.070
are banned certain technology

4754
03:04:55.450 --> 03:04:56.780
customers members are big and

4755
03:04:56.780 --> 03:04:58.460
small we have tech companies we

4756
03:04:58.460 --> 03:04:59.950
have manufacturing we of small

4757
03:04:59.950 --> 03:05:01.180
family owned businesses and

4758
03:05:01.180 --> 03:05:02.500
employ hundreds of thousands

4759
03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:04.430
of Californians these companies

4760
03:05:04.430 --> 03:05:05.460
continue just pay some of the

4761
03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:06.790
highest rates in the nation

4762
03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:08.650
-- and moving towards as as

4763
03:05:08.650 --> 03:05:09.870
we move towards full reliance

4764
03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:11.730
on renewables -- as they're

4765
03:05:11.730 --> 03:05:13.100
currently defined by the law

4766
03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:14.810
does relate risk the reliability

4767
03:05:14.810 --> 03:05:15.970
of our electric grid and we

4768
03:05:15.970 --> 03:05:17.760
need to be cautious and how

4769
03:05:17.760 --> 03:05:19.430
we get there so in one of the

4770
03:05:19.580 --> 03:05:21.110
potential costs associated with

4771
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:22.470
all the myriad other issues that

4772
03:05:22.470 --> 03:05:23.560
we're dealing with an energy

4773
03:05:23.560 --> 03:05:25.010
world right now including wild

4774
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:26.470
fires and climb an adaptation

4775
03:05:26.470 --> 03:05:28.530
of resilience we encourage and

4776
03:05:28.530 --> 03:05:29.850
appreciate the thoughtfulness

4777
03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:31.250
and prudence with which is

4778
03:05:31.250 --> 03:05:32.470
committee will consider energy

4779
03:05:32.470 --> 03:05:33.600
bills going forward and we

4780
03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:34.560
look forward to working with

4781
03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:36.420
you this year thanks thank you

4782
03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:42.030
Mister chairman and a assembly

4783
03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:43.520
member Correa thank you for

4784
03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:44.680
staying and for those that

4785
03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:46.480
are still watching -- I know

4786
03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:47.230
we all want to get out of

4787
03:05:47.230 --> 03:05:49.030
here and it was and I wasn't

4788
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:50.100
planning on speaking and tell

4789
03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:52.410
you raise the jobs issue --

4790
03:05:52.940 --> 03:05:55.610
ag Calpine owns and operates

4791
03:05:55.610 --> 03:05:56.380
seven hundred and twenty

4792
03:05:56.380 --> 03:05:57.680
five megawatts of geothermal

4793
03:05:57.680 --> 03:05:59.270
facilities and like in cinema

4794
03:05:59.270 --> 03:06:01.020
county those facilities

4795
03:06:01.020 --> 03:06:02.980
employed full time three

4796
03:06:02.980 --> 03:06:05.000
hundred people plus a hundred

4797
03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.610
plus contractors daily those

4798
03:06:07.680 --> 03:06:09.720
are hourly work force makes a

4799
03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:12.520
hundred thousand plus benefits

4800
03:06:12.750 --> 03:06:15.330
and bonuses except track those

4801
03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:16.860
are jobs that do not require a

4802
03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:20.080
college education unfortunately

4803
03:06:20.650 --> 03:06:21.660
AB are seven hundred and

4804
03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:23.050
twenty five megawatts of Jeff

4805
03:06:23.050 --> 03:06:25.020
thermal we're not sure how

4806
03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:26.530
those resources are going to

4807
03:06:26.530 --> 03:06:28.130
continue to operate because

4808
03:06:28.130 --> 03:06:29.860
they're not being port procured

4809
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:31.720
they are cost effective every

4810
03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:34.040
model has shown that there cost

4811
03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:35.230
effective they're important

4812
03:06:35.230 --> 03:06:37.220
to median R. G. H. G. goals

4813
03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:39.970
and also our reliability goals

4814
03:06:39.970 --> 03:06:41.730
they're available about ninety

4815
03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:43.850
eight point five I'm wrong

4816
03:06:43.850 --> 03:06:45.110
on that but about ninety nine

4817
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:47.130
percent of the time so we have

4818
03:06:47.130 --> 03:06:48.780
run legislation the last couple

4819
03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:50.700
of years with that assembly

4820
03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:53.110
member Aggie where curry Mr

4821
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:55.440
Garcia -- because we think your

4822
03:06:55.440 --> 03:06:57.220
thermals a really important

4823
03:06:57.220 --> 03:06:59.630
part of the resource mix going

4824
03:06:59.630 --> 03:07:02.040
forward -- both existing and

4825
03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:03.500
in New and Mr Garcia would

4826
03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:04.790
like to have that those same

4827
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:06.520
jobs and economic opportunities

4828
03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:08.410
in his district but number of

4829
03:07:08.410 --> 03:07:09.810
the people that have testified

4830
03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:11.350
before you today have opposed

4831
03:07:12.190 --> 03:07:14.700
that -- those bills and so

4832
03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:16.850
I just want to again say

4833
03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:19.200
this is still an issue and

4834
03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:20.160
something that we need to

4835
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:21.880
grapple with as we're looking

4836
03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:24.060
at an art towards our future

4837
03:07:24.060 --> 03:07:25.510
and how we're going to achieve

4838
03:07:26.050 --> 03:07:28.620
reliability in an affordable

4839
03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:30.230
way that accomplishes our GHG

4840
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:32.500
goals and as an added benefit

4841
03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:34.450
creates job but not necessarily

4842
03:07:34.450 --> 03:07:36.090
the single driver I hear

4843
03:07:36.090 --> 03:07:37.710
you on that but it is a huge

4844
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:40.140
benefit so thank you thank you

4845
03:07:43.170 --> 03:07:44.520
born column policy advocate

4846
03:07:44.520 --> 03:07:45.800
was Sierra Club California

4847
03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:46.950
thank you for the opportunity

4848
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:48.730
to comment today when most

4849
03:07:48.730 --> 03:07:49.720
people think about climate

4850
03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:50.920
pollution they think about power

4851
03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:52.490
plants in industry however a

4852
03:07:52.490 --> 03:07:54.200
quarter of California's GHG

4853
03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:55.590
emissions are from homes and

4854
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:57.430
buildings the majority of which

4855
03:07:57.610 --> 03:07:59.190
come from onsite combustion

4856
03:07:59.340 --> 03:08:00.820
of gas for you for heating

4857
03:08:01.250 --> 03:08:02.330
buildings are still a major

4858
03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:03.810
gap in California's climate

4859
03:08:03.810 --> 03:08:05.220
strategy Andy carbonization

4860
03:08:05.220 --> 03:08:07.210
conversations roughly ninety

4861
03:08:07.210 --> 03:08:08.580
percent of California's thirteen

4862
03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:09.930
million homes and buildings

4863
03:08:10.150 --> 03:08:11.760
rely on gas for water heating

4864
03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:13.520
and space heating these gas

4865
03:08:13.520 --> 03:08:15.360
appliances consume more gas than

4866
03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:16.950
all the state's power plants

4867
03:08:17.250 --> 03:08:18.430
creating a major source of

4868
03:08:18.430 --> 03:08:20.140
unregulated climate pollution

4869
03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:22.470
plus gas appliances worse an

4870
03:08:22.470 --> 03:08:24.430
indoor and outdoor air quality

4871
03:08:24.610 --> 03:08:25.840
and the distribution of gas

4872
03:08:25.840 --> 03:08:26.930
to buildings is found to be

4873
03:08:26.930 --> 03:08:28.570
increasingly vulnerable to

4874
03:08:28.570 --> 03:08:30.980
leaks and explosions California

4875
03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:32.430
must prioritize efforts to

4876
03:08:32.430 --> 03:08:34.000
electrify homes and buildings

4877
03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:35.530
to achieve climate safety

4878
03:08:35.530 --> 03:08:37.090
and affordable housing goals

4879
03:08:37.330 --> 03:08:39.280
and stop were seen our depend

4880
03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:41.430
are gas dependency leaders of

4881
03:08:41.430 --> 03:08:42.800
state agencies have a knowledge

4882
03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:44.140
the need to electrify gas and

4883
03:08:44.140 --> 03:08:45.590
uses empower them with clean

4884
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:47.830
and electricity Californians

4885
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:49.110
support this change just as

4886
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:50.210
they want clean energy on the

4887
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:51.920
grid they also want clean and

4888
03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:54.070
safe energy in their homes now

4889
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:55.310
we just need the policy changes

4890
03:08:55.310 --> 03:08:56.400
to make this a reality for

4891
03:08:56.400 --> 03:08:58.570
Californians thank you thank you

4892
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.960
good afternoon committee

4893
03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:03.420
members my name is Joseph with

4894
03:09:03.420 --> 03:09:05.190
men I'm with plants look clean

4895
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:07.110
energy we are the CCA serving

4896
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:09.560
San Matteo county I just wanna

4897
03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:11.570
one reiterate the points that

4898
03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:14.300
-- that spokesperson from EBC

4899
03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:16.460
made -- and then also point out

4900
03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:18.710
what we need to get through this

4901
03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:20.850
is collaboration with our state

4902
03:09:20.850 --> 03:09:23.180
agencies not the sort of fights

4903
03:09:23.180 --> 03:09:24.410
that we've been seeing and we're

4904
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:26.600
trying hard to do that with the

4905
03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:28.250
state agencies I took a lot of

4906
03:09:28.250 --> 03:09:30.100
heart in the February decision

4907
03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:31.310
from the P. you see about the

4908
03:09:31.310 --> 03:09:32.800
studies they're going to release

4909
03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:34.650
I hope they come out sooner

4910
03:09:34.650 --> 03:09:36.610
rather than later the end of the

4911
03:09:36.610 --> 03:09:38.470
year probably is too late for

4912
03:09:38.470 --> 03:09:39.820
those studies considering the

4913
03:09:39.820 --> 03:09:41.250
P. you see is that it wants to

4914
03:09:41.250 --> 03:09:43.680
look at central buyer in October

4915
03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:45.360
the study is that they're doing

4916
03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:47.010
will inform that decision so

4917
03:09:47.010 --> 03:09:48.440
having the studies after the

4918
03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:49.820
decision doesn't make much sense

4919
03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:51.690
to me and I think that gets into

4920
03:09:51.690 --> 03:09:53.440
the need to really take a hard

4921
03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:55.700
look at the state agencies that

4922
03:09:55.700 --> 03:09:57.330
are managing the are a system

4923
03:09:57.330 --> 03:09:59.080
they need to self reflect on how

4924
03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:01.700
that needs to change to keep

4925
03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:03.230
up with the market changes that

4926
03:10:03.230 --> 03:10:05.790
are coming P. C. E. has had

4927
03:10:06.650 --> 03:10:07.970
requirements come down from

4928
03:10:07.970 --> 03:10:09.130
the state agencies that were

4929
03:10:09.130 --> 03:10:11.220
around yes when we tried to

4930
03:10:11.220 --> 03:10:13.430
correct those just eight through

4931
03:10:13.430 --> 03:10:14.450
discussions with the state

4932
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:16.030
agencies it was very difficult

4933
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:17.470
to get accurate numbers about

4934
03:10:17.470 --> 03:10:18.790
the are a we were supposed to

4935
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:20.590
per care because they were using

4936
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:23.060
out of date information and so

4937
03:10:23.090 --> 03:10:24.030
you know there's a there's a two

4938
03:10:24.030 --> 03:10:25.320
way street here that I think we

4939
03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:27.070
need to talk about and I think

4940
03:10:27.070 --> 03:10:28.570
again took to Mister quirks

4941
03:10:28.570 --> 03:10:31.400
point a residual buyer can

4942
03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:33.640
do what's being asked to be done

4943
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:35.300
we put forward a very detailed

4944
03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:37.020
proposal on that and I think

4945
03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:38.120
we'll continue to have that

4946
03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:40.150
conversation but I just urge

4947
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:41.360
this committee to think very

4948
03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:43.180
carefully when it's asked him to

4949
03:10:43.180 --> 03:10:45.210
pass legislation on those issues

4950
03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:47.220
that it also thinks very hard

4951
03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:48.900
about sort of what's broken in

4952
03:10:48.900 --> 03:10:50.640
the current system and does that

4953
03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:53.210
new idea really fix it rate

4954
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:54.960
so I just want to echo that and

4955
03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:57.280
then also to assembly member

4956
03:10:57.280 --> 03:10:59.930
Carrillo PC E. has a sustainable

4957
03:10:59.930 --> 03:11:01.330
workforce policy that our

4958
03:11:01.330 --> 03:11:02.510
understanding is it's one of

4959
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:04.220
the strongest ones available

4960
03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:05.920
we have done over three hundred

4961
03:11:05.920 --> 03:11:07.880
megawatts of solar power plant

4962
03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:09.140
development in the state that's

4963
03:11:09.140 --> 03:11:11.490
led to direct union jobs and

4964
03:11:11.490 --> 03:11:12.570
I would be happy to share that

4965
03:11:12.570 --> 03:11:13.860
with you and share our vision

4966
03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:15.550
of how we develop a sustainable

4967
03:11:15.550 --> 03:11:17.830
work force across the state were

4968
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:19.260
sprinkling our plants around

4969
03:11:19.260 --> 03:11:20.540
the state so that those benefits

4970
03:11:20.540 --> 03:11:22.150
spread out they don't just stay

4971
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:24.140
in one area so hopefully we can

4972
03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:25.450
have a chat about that and I

4973
03:11:25.450 --> 03:11:27.410
can talk to about that thank you

4974
03:11:28.770 --> 03:11:30.640
thank you and and in a let me

4975
03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:31.920
think everyone who came out

4976
03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:34.000
to us here they're inside in

4977
03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:35.340
their comments we appreciate

4978
03:11:35.340 --> 03:11:36.350
the panelists because they

4979
03:11:36.350 --> 03:11:38.710
certainly brought us some focus

4980
03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:40.830
to our conversation and it was

4981
03:11:40.830 --> 03:11:42.820
really important that we have

4982
03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:45.440
this -- this hearing as I

4983
03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:47.540
said at the beginning of before

4984
03:11:47.540 --> 03:11:49.830
we got into the bill's making

4985
03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:50.730
their way to this committee

4986
03:11:50.730 --> 03:11:52.350
so that we can hear from all

4987
03:11:52.350 --> 03:11:54.250
of you in a way that helps and

4988
03:11:54.250 --> 03:11:55.940
former thinking and gives a some

4989
03:11:56.260 --> 03:11:57.660
clarity in terms of some of the

4990
03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:59.070
ways that we can move forward

4991
03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:01.540
in a -- an appropriate way

4992
03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:03.300
and one that's going to build

4993
03:12:03.570 --> 03:12:05.210
on our system so that it is

4994
03:12:05.210 --> 03:12:06.990
reliable so that is affordable

4995
03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:09.770
and that we are moving smartly

4996
03:12:09.770 --> 03:12:11.930
to our region are or carbon

4997
03:12:11.930 --> 03:12:14.540
reduction goals of you know

4998
03:12:14.540 --> 03:12:16.040
the the it says look at said all

4999
03:12:16.040 --> 03:12:17.320
the time the eyes of the world

5000
03:12:17.320 --> 03:12:19.530
are watching California and

5001
03:12:19.530 --> 03:12:20.820
and certainly that's heightened

5002
03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:22.560
now because of the instability

5003
03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:23.850
in our -- investor owned

5004
03:12:23.850 --> 03:12:26.070
utilities -- but we will get

5005
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:27.590
through that and we will create

5006
03:12:27.810 --> 03:12:29.000
we will see ourselves on the

5007
03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.490
other side but the question now

5008
03:12:30.490 --> 03:12:32.390
is what is that look like what

5009
03:12:32.390 --> 03:12:34.660
they see a growth of CCA's and

5010
03:12:35.070 --> 03:12:36.980
wanting to see that there's a

5011
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:39.140
ability to foster opportunities

5012
03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:41.600
for our the -- distributed

5013
03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:43.600
energy resource community and

5014
03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:45.670
developers there's still has

5015
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:47.200
to be a balance that has to

5016
03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:49.460
take place here and we want

5017
03:12:49.460 --> 03:12:50.700
to find ourselves in a place

5018
03:12:50.700 --> 03:12:53.150
where are we're not back in

5019
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:55.320
the late nineteen nineties and

5020
03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:57.690
two thousands where a resource

5021
03:12:57.690 --> 03:12:59.560
adequacy becomes the issue again

5022
03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:01.710
that will as Mr Paterson point

5023
03:13:01.710 --> 03:13:03.720
now create a lot of anxiety and

5024
03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:05.520
fear amongst everyone so we want

5025
03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:06.480
to make sure we're putting forth

5026
03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:08.610
good policies and we're putting

5027
03:13:08.610 --> 03:13:10.680
forth policies that make sense

5028
03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:11.900
of their pieces of the puzzle

5029
03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:13.120
we acknowledge all the time

5030
03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:14.260
especially with this committee

5031
03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:16.080
there are a lot of pieces to

5032
03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:17.690
the puzzle that are on the table

5033
03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:18.930
sometimes you feel they're just

5034
03:13:18.930 --> 03:13:20.380
scattered all over the table

5035
03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:22.700
you're trying to force one piece

5036
03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:24.580
and just because it looks like

5037
03:13:24.580 --> 03:13:27.070
it should fit the right color

5038
03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:28.710
you remember those puzzles are

5039
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:30.670
your kids a ten thousand pieces

5040
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:31.510
and you're trying to make him

5041
03:13:31.510 --> 03:13:33.590
all come together and yet do

5042
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:34.790
you have to be smart about

5043
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:36.430
how you wind it up because

5044
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:37.760
just because it looks like

5045
03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:38.720
it's supposed to work doesn't

5046
03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:39.990
necessarily mean it's meant to

5047
03:13:39.990 --> 03:13:41.910
work so we're going to do our

5048
03:13:42.310 --> 03:13:44.410
our very best to to navigate

5049
03:13:44.410 --> 03:13:46.700
through of the issues that are

5050
03:13:46.700 --> 03:13:47.750
in front of us I think this

5051
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:50.220
state is done great work -- to

5052
03:13:50.220 --> 03:13:52.560
lay out a clear vision of how

5053
03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:54.440
we can move forward -- but we

5054
03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:56.520
do have some central questions

5055
03:13:56.520 --> 03:13:57.760
about the future of natural

5056
03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:00.100
gas is an example and how of

5057
03:14:00.100 --> 03:14:01.590
that is going to work for it

5058
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:02.680
and there are those who think

5059
03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:04.940
we need to tomorrow be often

5060
03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:06.280
there others it's a well that's

5061
03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:07.370
going to take awhile in this

5062
03:14:07.370 --> 03:14:09.910
transition -- or should hell

5063
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:11.090
was have a reserve and there
