WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED LET'S BEGIN WITH MONICA MORALIS. I GET AFTERNOON THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN MONICA MORALES FOR THE RECORD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M JUST REALLY WANTED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND BE THE HIGHLIGHT- YOU KNOW OUR NEED TO MOVE. A THE OPPOSITE SUICIDE PREVENTION. IN JANUARY AS YOU RECALL A NEW LAW A. B. TWELVE. ON TWENTY ONE TWELVE EXCUSE ME BECAME EFFECTIVE THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. ALL OF THE ROLE THAT CDPH WOULD PLAY IS REALLY TRYING TO ALIGN A LOT OF OUR EFFORTS AROUND SINCE A CONVENTION ACROSS THE STATE STARTED BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WILL BE TRYING TO CONDUCT- STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS BOTH REGIONALLY AS WELL AS IN CERTAIN- COMMUNITIES OF SUICIDE PREVENTION OLICIES AND PRACTICES. AND REALLY TRYING TO MONITOR AND TRACK ON THAT- DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REALLY TARGETING SOME OF OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL INCONVENIENT EXPERTS THAT REALLY CAN TARGET SOME OF OUR MOST- IMPACTED POPULATIONS. SUCH AS YOUTH NATIVE AMERICANS AND SENIORS FOR EXAMPLE OUR BALL REALLY IS TO THINK AS WE PRESENTED AND SUBMITTED THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER OF WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE VISION THAT THE COMMISSION HAD FOR THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU IS THERE PROCREATION OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF FOR FY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO NINE POINT TO REALLY SUPPORT THE STAFFING OF FIVE FIFTIES TO BE EXACT TO. ADMINISTER. THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. NOW WE BEEN MEETING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO REALLY ALSO NOT THIS NOW BUT HISTORICALLY IN SOME OF OUR WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THEM. TO REALLY THINK THROUGH YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING IN CALIFORNIA AND INCLUDING OURSELVES. I'M WE KNOW THAT THE- TRANSFER SUICIDE PREVENTION AND STRIVING FOR ZERO REALLY OUTLINED SOME OF HIS KEY ACTIVITIES WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE IS- ANY REDUNDANCIES WHAT WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT IS. YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVED TWO MILLION TO REALLY START THINKING ABOUT DOING SOME STRATEGIC PLANNING WITH AND BUILDING COALITIONS REALLY LOOKING AT A RESEARCH AGENDA THAT GOES BEYOND JUST DATA SURVEILLANCE. AND SO WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO- THOSE EFFORTS AND BY MEETING WITH THEM BUT ALSO WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS OVERLAP IN THE WORK THAT WE WOULD BE DOING IN THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION SINCE. SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING WILL CONCLUDE BY JUNE. THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT SUICIDE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. UP BY MULTIPLE ENTITIES ITS SYSTEMATIC AND THE MORE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE AT THE TABLE TO COORDINATE REALLY HELPED ELEVATE YOU KNOW THE WORK TAKING PLACE- IN SUICIDE PREVENTION IN CALIFORNIA. I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A PLAN TO GET TO MEET WITH THE KIND. TO FURTHER DEFINE WHAT'S IN THE PLAN WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN THE PREVENTION BROWN AND WHAT'S REALLY IN THE ROLE THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. SO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP FILL A GAP THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE CORONATION. I'M IN WITH THE PARTNERING WITH OFFICE OF SUICIDE AND- TO KIND OF MOVE THAT FORWARD ACROSS OUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. SOME OF OUR KEY KIND OF START UP ACTIVITIES FOR US- IF THIS MOVES FORWARD. IS REALLY CONTINUING TO MEET OUR MORE CONSISTENCY WITH CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMISSION REALLY THINKING ABOUT DEVELOPING OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. FOR THE FIRST LIKE SHORT. TERM BUT ALSO THE LONG TERM. BRINGING IN OUR STAFF WE WOULD DEFINITELY YOU KNOW IT'S A NEW INITIATIVE FOR US WILL HAVE TO HIRE KIND OF STARTING FROM SCRATCH. SO THAT WILL BE A BIG PRIORITY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY THINKING ABOUT COMPETING IN THE AN ADVISORY GROUP THAT CAN REALLY HELP. GUIDE SOME OF THESE EFFORTS I'M AND THEN FINDING OF THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. IN IRAN JANUARY. TO AND THIS AND THIRD OR GENERATING TO ABOUT SOME OF THE DATA ELEMENTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE. SO WITH THAT I CAN POLICY NOW AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPUTY DIRECTOR. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TERRY SU CANALE. DALMAN ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD I'M HERE TO SUPPORT A MONICA AS HER ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. WONDERFUL NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO BE DEALING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AS YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN. SEVERAL YEARS IN THE MAKING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE PLAYED A VERY ESSENTIAL LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO REINVEST AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A AN UPDATED STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN- VERY THANKFUL FOR THE SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WITH WORKS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS REALITY I ALSO WANT TO- THINGS NUMBER RAMOS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN CALLING FOR THIS OFFICE CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE. ARE WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PLAN WE ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE CASE IN OUR OVERLAP. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW LEADERSHIP CDPH RECOGNIZING. THAT THAT KOBE HAS REALLY TAKEN UP MOST OF. THEIR TIME AT SHOULD BE- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER. IN PARTICULARLY ELEVATING THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THE OVERALL HIGHER KEY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALL LAY OUT WHY. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA WILL BE. IMPLEMENTING A SHIP TO NINE A DATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND SUICIDE PREVENTION BASED ON NEW FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND FEDERAL LAW. WE'RE WORKING TO BRING THE CRISIS NOW MODEL TO CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL HAVE A NEXUS TO THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. AND THOSE TWO THINGS NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO OUR SISTER PREVENTION EFFORTS SIMILARLY THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS AROUND ENHANCING MOBILE CRISIS. WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS INVESTMENTS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUT OUR SCHOOLMENTAL HEALTH STRATEGIES AND SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE SAYS THAT PREVENTION PLANS. B. THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE THAT THE COMMISSION SEES IN TERMS OF SUICIDE PREVENTION INCLUDES ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IT IT INCLUDES CREATING AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY THAT BRINGS OUT THE BEST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MANAGED CARE. STRUCK ME THE PULP THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH YEAH THE SURGEON GENERAL- WE ASK AND WE HOPE THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION. THAT HIGH LEVEL LEADERSHIP. REALLY NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF A CAREER EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SO THAT THE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH OUR- TRIBAL PARTNERS AS WITH HIGHLIGHTED IN THE LEGISLATION THAT HAS LED TO. A CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY WE THINK IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO BUILD OUT AND IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY ON SUICIDE PREVENTION. THAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE A VERY SENSITIVE POSITION THAT IS WORKING TOWARDS A HOLISTIC VISION OF THE ROLE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE OTHER MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT WILL BE ESSENTIAL. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN STRENGTHENING NOT JUST OUR DIRECT PREVENTION WORK BETTER UPSTREAM PRIMARY PREVENTION RESILIENCY SUPPORT. AND ENGAGEMENT OR- DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. AB WE RECOGNIZE THAT CITY PAGES DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB IN TRYING DOWN FEDERAL MONEY TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS WE ARE WORKING WITH AS WAS MENTIONED. IN THAT CAN THE ANALYSIS AND THE BAY CITY AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT ARE WORKING WITH INTERNAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT- AT OVER TWO DOZEN COUNTY STRENGTHENED THEIR SISTER PREVENTION EFFORTS. WE THINK THERE ARE COUPLE OF CHALLENGES THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ONE IS STRENGTHENING OUR STRATEGY AROUND REAL TIME SUICIDE PREVENTION DATA. YOU KNOW WE WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR TOMORROW THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN ADDRESSING THE GAP IN VACCINATION RATES TODAY WE WILL HAVE REAL TIME INFORMATION. WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION AROUND RISK SELF INJURY HARM AND SUICIDE SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY RESPONSES. THAT ARE- TIMELY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS IN AREAS OF OPIOID ADDICTIONS AND DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO OPIOID WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS IN OTHER AREAS OF HEALTHCARE. CALIFORNIA MUST STRENGTHEN ITS STRATEGY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF SUICIDE IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE STAFF THAN IS ENVISIONED IN THE B. C. P. ADDITIONALLY OUTREACH IN COORDINATION IS GOING TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OFTEN BEAR THE GREATEST BURDEN OF RISK STOP ARM AND SUICIDE SO SOME ADDITIONAL STAFF TO REALLY STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. WE THINK THERE'S A COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT COMMUNICATION ELEMENT MUST BE HANDLED VERY SENSITIVELY AND ENGAGE SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS OF THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT RSK. AND HARM AND SUICIDE DOES NOT. ITSELF CREATE ADDITIONAL HARM- YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BROADER INVESTMENT- BOTH ONE TIME FUNDS SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS. AROUND PARTNERING WITH COUNTIES SCHOOLS TRIBES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO FIVE MILLION I'M GOING TO REALLY SUPPORT THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FEDERAL PRIVATE COUNTY AND OTHER PUBLIC PARTNERS TO REALLY MAKE THIS STRATEGY WHAT WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA TO SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AGAIN WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE THAT DETAILED DISCUSSION WITH THE LEADERSHIP CDPH. BUT I RIGHT SHARE SOME OF THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE. STAYED AT THE OFFICE NEEDS PURSUE. LIKE TO SEE FINDING HELLO WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS. THANK THANK VERY MUCH- MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROSS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS- CERTAINLY AS THE AUTHOR OF AB AT TWENTY ONE TWELVE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT'S- VERY IMPORTANT- I'M HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENCINA HEARING THE PRESENTATIONS WILL BE FOR ANA THANK ALL THOSE THAT AREN'T. ENGAGED AND- MOVING FORWARD ON SOME OF THE- REQUEST OF FUNDING WE SEE COMING FROM- THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT WITH THE CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED- K. BUT- TO- MISTER- EWINGS- COMMENTS THERE'S FAR MORE TO DO THIS IS A JUST A FIRST STEP. IN REALLY ADDRESSING THE- SUICIDE RATES ESPECIALLY AMONGST THE- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DIVE INTO THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE WE SEE THE UPTICKS- IN A SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK ALL THOSE IN MY COLLEAGUES FOR MOVING FORWARD ON TWENTY ONE TWELVE TODAY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND CERTAINLY TO- CONTINUE TO- ADVOCATE FOR MORE FUNDING UNTIL WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE- REALLY HAVE THE FUNNY WE NEED. AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT IS HEART. WARMING TO HEAR THAT FINALLY THE SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND IT HAS GOT TO THE LEVEL TO WHERE IT IS HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WITH A BILL OF OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AND NOW WITH THE DISCUSSION OF FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. FOR ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN AGAIN- WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PART. OF THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD AS FAR AS BUILDING THAT PLAN THAT SO MANY. HAVE SEEN THAT NOW IS AFFECTING ALL THE YOU INCLUDING THE YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES FOR THEM THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS TOPIC. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW YOU'LL- YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SPOT ON WEDNESDAY. PRIOR PRESENTATIONS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND I REALLY DO. APPRECIATE THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO KIND OF GET A CLARITY ON IS. THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGH THEIR EL CAP. ON SUICIDE PREVENTION OF WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY. A PREDOMINANT- IN IN THE YEARS PAST. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE REQUIREMENT BUT THE LACK OF FUNDING AND LACK OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS LACK OF. WHERE CAN WE HAVE THIS INTEGRATION. TO BE EFFECTIVE TO REDUCE THAT. AMOUNT OF- OF- TRAGEDY IN OUR SCHOOLS ALSO AS A AS A PARTNER. THAT QUESTION WAS DIRECTED AT TO BE HEALING IF YOU WANT TICKETS. THANK YOU. WELL CONCERT WITH MY PRIOR COMMENTS I THINK THIS IS THE LEADERSHIP STRATEGY THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE TODAY THE STATE HAS- CREATE AN APPROPRIATE POLICIES IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT ARE MISSING THE- ADEQUATE FUNDING SUFFICIENT ATTENTION ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING WITH SCHOOLS WITH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS EVEN HOW WE TALK ABOUT RISK AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION WE REALLY NEED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. WE NEED TO HAVE A BROAD VISION FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO ENSURE THAT THESE NUMBERS COME DOWN QUICKLY DRAMATICALLY IN ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF CALIFORNIA DOING THAT WILL MEAN BUILDING OUT ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS WITH EMPLOYERS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HOSPITALS PUBLIC SAFETY AS A PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS OFFICERS FIREFIGHTERS. ALL OF US JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT THE CORONA VIRUS AND HOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES NEED TO TAKE ON WE NEED TO TAKE ON SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE SAME WAY AND SO I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE MOVING FORWARD AROUND HOW WE STRUCTURE THESE RELATIONSHIPS HOW WE FUND THESE STRATEGIES. WE TOO ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROPOSAL HERE WE THINK IT FALLS A LITTLE SHORT WE LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN STAFF AND RESOURCES TO REALLY BRING THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS NECESSARY. TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M- I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IF I COULD ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM TOBY EWING SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON HOW. OR WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN STRENGTHENED REAL TIME DATA WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AGAIN THIS IS ONE COME AROUND IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO RIGHT NOW I AGREE WITH TO BE WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF BOXER BE MORE INNOVATIVE WHEN IT COMES. TO THE WAY THAT WE'RE COLLECTING DATA RIGHT NOW WE RELY A LOT ON OUR VITAL STATISTICS DATA WERE ALSO WORKING AS MEDIAN L. ON OUR- BALADEH REPORTING THAT WE DEALING SO WE- THIS GOAL. ARE WE ACTUALLY DO THIS ON FAST A LITTLE MORE I'M ACCURATE ICE AND BE ABLE MOVE SOME OF THE PUBLIC FORWARD. AS HIS RULES OUT ANY GOING TO BE OF THE FOR PRIOR. IS AS AT THE MAIN WHAT WE LEARNED FROM COVERED WHAT CAN WE NOW CAN WE USE AND OF THOSE. THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY PUT PLACE TO ELEVATE OF THE WERE AROUND- YOU'RE RIGHT. AND ENTRY OF- THE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE AND CAL IT'S A FOR THEM MINISTRY. I'M IN TWO COMMENTS HAD MENTIONED THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR FONG. WOULD YOU MORE STAFF- IF YOU MORE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE MORE TIME. RT IT AT LET'S HAS TO DO A LOT WITH. RIGHT IN SO. THAT WE MAY. IN THAT A LOT OF THESE IT IS. AT THE LOW. LEVEL I'M AND SO IT'S- THE I PLAN OF THE WAY THAT THE DAY. INTO AND GETS TO EVEN THE DEPART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SO AS YOU THINK THROUGH THOSE. AND THEN ALL THE IT TECH. NEW TO. BUILD BACK. THAT'S AN ASSESSMENT THAT WE WILL TO DO ORDER FROM TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW WHAT EXACT- IS NEEDED AT THIS POINT. I'M A THANK FOR YOUR- TO HEAR FROM THE- IS OUR- AND WANTING TO ADDRESS THIS IS. HAD A- AND- IF. IS A NEED FOR US TO A BROADER. SO THAT WE CAN SUPPLY. THIS OFFICE WE- MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE IN THOSE KIND. AND SO LOOK FOR. TO CONTINUING THAT TEND. THANK YOU FOR CAN. RIGHT NOW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MEMBERS- TOBY I HAD A IF I COULD BEFORE I. TOBY I'M ONE OUNCE A QUESTION IF I COULD YOU AND MEANT NINE EIGHT EIGHT. AS WELL AS CRISIS NOW Mà WAS HER YOU COULD A LEVEL DETAIL. THANK YOU. AGAIN TO BE WITH MEN HEALTH COMMISSION. SO FEDERAL LAW. IT ALL ALL STATES MOVING TO IN. A THREE DIGIT CALL IN SYSTEM TO TAKE PRESS OFF THE NINE ONE. IN THE ONE OF THE GOAL IS TO ADD. HAVE MORE A MENTAL HEALTH. TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHRIST RATHER THAN A LAWN. RESPONSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AROUND WHAT KINDS OF CALL ARE COMING IN HOW WE ADDRESS. THAT THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT ARE OF- THERE YET THERE'S SOME. OPINION AROUND THIS A SYSTEM THAT IS PRIMARILY. TO BE SERVICE RISK. VERSES BROUGHT MENTAL HEALTH. HOW TO SO OF THAT COME. WHICH TO TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT- TEN OR TWELVE. BECAUSE OF SOME DEBT. IS DO WE BUILD OFF OF OR REFER. THE CERTIFY HOTLINE SYSTEM WITH THE NINE EIGHT SAID ARE THEY YOU CONNECT ARE THERE WEREN'T. WE STILL HAVE TO PAY THAT OUT. AGAIN I MENTIONED CRIED NOW WHICH IS A NATIONAL MODEL DEVELOPED BY SAM'S. IT'S EVIDENCE BASED. WE'RE WORKING WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN K. TO IMPLEMENT THE CRISIS NOW MODEL. THE IS REALLY A STRANGE. THE CONDUCT. RESPONSE FOR MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT. THANK YOU. TO AVOID PRIMARY TO AVOID FORCED INVOLVED. M. THERE'S A NAY. HIGH AND THEY'RE NOT BE A TIED. BETWEEN THE NUMBER THAT THAT RESIDENTS CALLED. AND THE KINDS OF RESPONSE THAT WERE. THAT THEY WERE SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WHEN CALL WITH THE MEN HEALTH. WE ACTUALLY DELAY A MENTAL HEALTH RISKS. WITH SOMEONE CALL WITH THIS. CRISIS WE DELIVER SIMILAR RISK AND SAVE LIVES. SO I'M VERY HM LEVEL OF WORK TO DO THAT IS ABOUT VISION STRATEGY AND THEN IMPLEMENTATION THAT INCLUDES HOW WE FUND THESE SERVICES. HOW WE MAKE HOW WE MANAGE THE SHIFT FROM NINE ONE ONE TWO NINE EIGHT EIGHT HOW WE PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE THE TECH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. IN ADDITION TO THE DOZEN OR SO COUNTIES THAT WERE WORKING WITH THE CRISIS NOW WE'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY ANOTHER TWO DOZEN COUNTIES. TO SEE IF THERE'S ROOM FOR. THOSE ADDITIONAL COUNTIES TO JOIN THIS LEARNING COLLABORATIVE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BUILT UNDER THIS CRISIS NOW MODEL. AND THE LAST THING I MEN IS THE STRATEGY I KNEW IN ENHANCE IN FACT REMEMBER FROM MENTAL HEALTH RISK. WELL A LOT. BEGINNING IN. TO STRAIN UR MO MALL REFER WHICH NEEDS TO BE A TIE INTO THE NINE EIGHTY AND CRIED NOW SO IT'S UNCLEAR. HOW THE STATE'S SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGY WILL CONNECT WITH THAT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING AT THIS POSITION BE HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE POSITION THAT CAN REALLY. LEAD AND SORT OUT MANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND BE PART OF THE STRATEGY. THROUGHOUT NINE EIGHT EIGHT CRISIS NOW GLOBAL PRICES WHICH WILL PRIMARILY BE. LED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I KNOW LIKE TO TURN IT TO THE ADMIN. OF I COULD- EARLIER YOU HAD SAID- SUICIDE NEED TO BE A BY MULTIPLE AND WAS HOPING COULD COMMENT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT NINE EIGHT EIGHT WOULD PLAY IN SUICIDE PREVENTION. SORRY THAT WAS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES MA'AM. APOLOGIES THAT IS TECHNICAL SHOULD YEAH I MEAN WE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THIS THAT DEFINITELY TO SHIP FOR ANY THAT WE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM NOT JUST THE STATE AND THE- EVEN WITH LOCAL CHURCH AND. AND THAT IT'S AN THAT WHAT CAN SEND. OF WE'RE HAVING OF THAT THE ARE IN. LANE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS I THINK ONLY TALK ABOUT MULTIPLE ENTITIES- AND DEALING WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION FROM YOUTH ALL THE WAY TO ADULTS THAT- THERE HAS TO BE THAT- AS FAR AS AN OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK ALL THESE FILLERS- PHILIP TO ONE AREA SO THEN WE TRULY UNDERSTAND THE DATA OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. MORE OF A CLEARING HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THAT'S A VISION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AN ADVOCATE FOR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR. LEADING THIS DISCUSSION. I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL TO ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY. WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE LIZABETH LANDSBERG. THE DIRECTOR OF POSH PAD AND COREY HASHI DONNA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LYNCHBURG. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THOSE PLANS BURKE THE DIRECTOR OF OFFENSE AND I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. HEALTHCARE COSTS AE RISING AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE RATE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATIONOVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS INFLATION HAS GROWN BY 44% OF THE COST OF PREMIUMS HAS GROWN BY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND 50% OR MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION. THE STATE NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF COST DRIVERS. AND DRIVERS OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. AND STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY AND EQUITY OF CARE. AS MOST ARE LIKELY AWARE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE THE POLICY BILL TO CREATE THE OFFICE WHICH STARTED WITH THE SAME LANGUAGE AS IN OUR TRAILER BILL. WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT AND TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT OUR PROPOSED OFFICE. I WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WOULDN'T HAVE STAFF FOR THEIR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE AND FOR THEIR COLLABORATION. THE OFFICE WOULD BE CHARGED WITH ANALYZING THE HEALTHCARE COSTS MARKET FOR COST TRENDS AND DRIVERS OF SPENDING. SETTING AND ENFORCING HEALTH ARE COST TARGETS AND MEASURING KEY INDICATORS TO ENSURE WE ARE ACHIEVING A HIGH VALUE SYSTEM RATHER THAN A LOW COST LOW. RATHER THAN A LOW COST AND LOW ABOUT VALUE SYSTEM. SO WHEN I JUST GO THROUGH THE KEY ACTIVITIES AT THE POST OFFICE. WE GET INCREASED PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY BY TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN THE STATE. THE OFFICE WOULD REQUIRE REPORTING OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE DATA BROKEN DOWN BY SERVICE CATEGORY SUCH AS HOSPITAL CARE PHYSICIAN SERVICES PERSCRIPTION DRUGS EXCEPT FOR A- THIS DATA WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM PROVIDERS AND GRANULAR CLAIMS DATA FROM THE EMERGING HEALTH CARE PAYMENT STATUS SYSTEM. THE OFFICE WOULD PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PUBLIC MEETINGS ON HEALTHCARE SPENDING TRENDS IN UNDERLYING FACTORS ALONG WITH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONTROL COSTS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EQUITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. NEXT THE OFFICE WOULD SET AN OVERALL STATEWIDE COST TARGETS AND SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. THOSE TARGETS THE SPECIFIC SECTOR TARGETS COULD BE BY HEALTHCARE SECTOR AS WELL AS BY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGION. NEXT THE OFFICE WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COST TARGETS. THE OFFICE WOULD PROGRESSIVELY ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH COST TARGETS BEGINNING WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED TO INCLUDE TESTIMONY AT PUBLIC MEETINGS CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND ULTIMATELY IF NECESSARY ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL PENALTIES. THE OFFICE WILL ALSO PROMOTE AND MEASURE QUALITY IN EQUITY THROUGH PERFORMANCE REPORTING. TO AVOID UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD RESULT FROM FOCUSING ON COST ALONE PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY EQUITY MEASURES WELL THE MEASURE TO GUARD AGAINST NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE OFFICE WOULD LEVERAGE QUALITY IN EQUITY METRICS USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES COVER CALIFORNIA ANOTHER EXISTING MEASURES TO DECREASE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT. NEXT THE OFFICE WOULD SET A STATEWIDE GOAL FOR ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS AND DEVELOP STANDARDS FOR USE BY PAYERS AND PROVIDERS. THE OFFICE WOULD SET THE STATE WIDE GOAL FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS THAT PROMOTE SHIFTING PAYMENTS FROM FEE FOR SERVICE TO PAYMENTS THAT REWARD HIGH QUALITY AND COST EFFECTIVE CARE. THE OFFICE WOULD MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOAL AND ADOPT STANDARDS FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS TO BE USED BY PROVIDERS AND PAYERS TURNING CONTRACTING. THE OFFICE BUT ALSO MEASURED PROVOKED AS THE STATE SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. MODELS THAT INTEGRATE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. AS WELL AS REDUCE DOWNSTREAM HEALTHCARE COSTS. IN ORDER TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY THE OFFICE WOULD MEASURE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES ALLOCATED TO PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THAT SPENDING BENCHMARKS IN THESE AREAS. THE OFFICE BUT ALSO MONITOR AND ADDRESS HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE STABILITY COLLECTING DATA AND ANALYZING CHANGES TO THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE TO AVOID HARMFUL REDUCTIONS TO THE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THE OFFICE WOULD HAVE A ROLE IN REVIEWING PROPOSED HEALTHCARE CONSOLIDATIONS KNOWLEDGE EVEN IF IT'S GONNA BE THIS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF COST. TO THE OFFICE BUT INCREASED PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ON TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT MARKET COMPETITION REVIEWING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS NOT CURRENTLY REVIEWED BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT I RESPONSES TYPICALLY TO CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I'M HAPPY TO DO SO NOW- OF THE CHAIR WITH LIKE. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU SO I WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THIS DIALOGUE A VERY THAT PERSPECTIVE. WITH RESPECT TO EQUITABLE TREATMENT BETWEEN PAYERS AND PROVIDERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR EXISTING REVIEW PROCESSES BY STATE DEPARTMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE REVIEW OF PREMIUMS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO LEVERAGE THOSE ANALYSES AND NOT DUPLICATE THEM. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA LAW EXTENDS RATE REVIEW FILING REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE LARGE GROUPS REQUIREMENT THAT GOES BEYOND THAT REQUIRED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. STATE REGULATED PLANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL SMALL AND LARGE GROUP MARKETS MUST FILE RATE INFORMATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING A RATE CHANGE. TAKING A BROADER VIEW THE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY WOULD FOCUS ON ALL COST DRIVERS THAT AFFECT PREMIUMS AND THE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES BORNE BY CONSUMERS. THE OFFICE WILL EXAMINE THE COST OF CARE BY LOOKING AT ALL CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDING DOCTORS AND OTHER PROVIDERS HOSPITALS PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVECOSTS AND PROFITS OF HEALTH PLANS. NEXT WITH RESPECTIVE CONTROLLING COSTS AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY THE OFFICE WILL HAVE GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT COST CONTAINMENT DOES NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY EQUITY OR WORK FOR STABILITY AND WE'RE BEING VERY PURPOSEFUL ABOUT THAT. THE OFFICE WOULD COLLECT DATA AND CAREFULLY MONITOR EACH OF THESE AREAS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE NEEDED AND BECAUSE WE HOPE WILL EVENTUALLY REDUCE COSTS. AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE HIGH COST CARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EFFICIENT AND DELIVER VALUE AND WE ARE EXPLORING HOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WHAT WOULD BE UNIQUE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IS THAT WE WILL COLLECT AND REPORT DATA ON HARMFUL TRENDS AND CHANGES IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND DEVELOP STANDARDS TO INFORM STRATEGIES. TO LOWER COSTS IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES THE STABILITY AND TRAINING NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. THE OFFICE WILL ALSO REPORT QUALITY PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY METRICS ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IT'S PAYMENT MODELS THAT REWARD HIGH QUALITY AND COST EFFICIENT CARE AND PROMOTE INVESTMENTS IN PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. NEXT THE OFFICE IS MINDFUL OF NOT CREATING MISALIGNED INCENTIVES AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OUR PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO AVOID THESE OUTCOMES THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE HAD A HEAD START. THE DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP EXPERTISE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND FACILITATING. LOOK CONVERSATION FOR ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND COST SHIFTING IN THE NEXT ROUND OF AMENDMENTS FOR AB ELEVEN THIRTY SPECIFIC CATEGORIES ARE REFERENCES TO POTENTIAL SECTOR TARGETS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO NOT PRESUPPOSE WHAT SECTORS ARE APPROPRIATE WE HEARD FEEDBACK THAT CREATING NUMEROUS SECTOR TARGETS COULD LEAD TO A SILO APPROACH AND FRAGMENTATION RATHER THAN A COOPERATIVE APPROACH THAT WE ARE SEEKING BETWEEN ENTITIES TO ACHIEVE COST TARGETS AND WE WILL BE MINDFUL. OF THIS AND SETTING THE SECTOR TARGETS. AND FINALLY WE- THAT THE PROCESSES OF OFFICE NEED HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT. IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING TARGET SHOULD BE DONE IN A WAY THAT INCREASES CONFIDENCE IN THE PROGRAM. BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT LOOKING NEEDING ACT ALL MEETINGS OF THEADVISORY BOARD WITH THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ROBUST DISCUSSION AND SUBMIT PUBLIC COMMENT ON PROPOSED COST TARGETS. A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE DIRECTOR WOULD FORMALLY ADOPT THE COST TARGETS ARE ALSO PUBLIC MEETINGS SUBJECT TO BAGLEY KEENE. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE I THINK- I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE EXAMPLE WE SET FORTH IN THE WAY WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. ARE YOU SPEEDY PROGRAM I THINK IS INDICATIVE OF THE WAY WE WOULD WANT TO APPROACH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY I THINK ANYONE WHO'S BEEN PART OF THE H. P. D. PROCESS- THE BOARD. KNOWS THAT WE HAVE HEARD A DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND- I THINK IT'S PRETTY AMAZING JOB OF COMING TO CONSENSUS AFTER HEARING ALL OF THOSE- DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND SO I THINK THAT SHOULD DO IT- IN VIEW. BUT THE COMMITTEE WAS SUDDEN WHAT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH OUR OUR RELATIONSHIPS pWITH STAKEHOLDERS. SO I'M HAPPY TO STOP AT THIS POINT HELLO MISTER CHAIR OR- QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WILL NEXT GO TO COREY HASHI DARK. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA ACCORDING FROM THE ILIO- GENERALLY WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS TO RAISE WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY. JUST A FEW CONSIDERATIONS TO RAISE GOING FORWARD- GIVEN THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES HAVE BEEN A MAJOR PUBLIC POLICY CONCERN IN THE STATE FOR A WHILE- AND THAT THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE- WE FIND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS OFFICE WHICH GENERALLY HAS THE GOAL OF CONTAINING ESCALATING HEALTH CARE COSTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MAKES SENSE AND CONCEPT AS A METHOD TO RESPOND TO THE STATE'S AFFORDABILITY ISSUES- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE REQUEST- EVENTUALLY RAMPING UP TO OVER. A HUNDRED TWENTY POSITIONS IN ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A FEW YEARS- REGARDING THE RESOURCE REQUEST THAT THE PROPOSED OFFICE IS LARGELY MODELED AFTER. A SIMILAR AFFORDABILITY INITIATIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS KNOWN AS THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION OR THE H. P. C. AND THE PROPOSED LEVEL OF STAFFING IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE H. P. C. WHICH WE FIND TO BE GENERALLY REASONABLE BUT WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS SOME CONSTITUENTS ARE AND BE ABOUT WHETHER. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL BE- THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OVER THE COMING YEARS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CHECK IN WITH SOME DEGREE OF REGULARITY. ON LEVEL ON WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES ATTACHED TO THIS PROPOSAL ARE ARE APPROPRIATE GOING FORWARD- BEYOND THE STAFFING REQUEST WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSED OFFICE IS LIKELY GOING TO BE VERY ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT- THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF ENTITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BE VERY. PROVIDERS OR PAYERS- AND IT'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT. LEFT FOR THIS OFFICE TO DETERMINE. EXACTLY WHAT IT PER. TO AND- WHAT TARGETS THESE ENTITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET AND SUCH AND SO I SUCH GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE. ARMY ONE OF MONITOR MORE BROADLY THE PROGRESS TOWARDS FULLY IMPLEMENTING THIS OFFICES ACTIVITIES- BUILT THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OFFICES COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BEGIN NOW WITH MEMBERS QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU CHARAMBA- I THINK THE BIGGEST THING WITH THIS THE STRIKES ME BESIDES THE ENORMOUS ADMINISTRATIVE COST TO IT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS. AS IS YOU AND I WORKED ON THESE BUDGETS FOR SEVEN YEARS IS THAT. WE'RE WE'RE BLOWIN 8090% OF THE MONEY ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY GETTING DOWN TO THE PEOPLE THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS I HAVE HERE. IN IN THE OTHER THE SOMETHING ELSE WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT THESE COMPUTER SYSTEMS- THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING THAT THE AGENCIES DON'T WORK SO AS AS THE- I WANT AN ANSWER ON THIS ONE. IS AS AS WE GO TO MOVE- IN AND DO ALL THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF WHAT WHAT COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE OUT OF GOING TO FINALLY BE AT A AT AN APP BASED SYSTEM WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE SERVICES CAN PICK UP THEIR PHONE AND ENTER THEIR INFO AND DO SCREEN SHOTS AND- BE PART OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND WE'RE CALIFORNIA SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IT OR NOT. DEAR DEAR YOUR SCREEN ALREADY FROZE THE TUG OF THE COMPUTERS ARE. DIRECTOR YOUR- FRIDA MAKE COMMENT IF YOU'D LIKE OR WE CAN MOVE ON AS YOU SEE FIT. SURE I'M HAPPY TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS CONCERNED SO IN TERMS OF AND IT ALSO RELATES OF WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NOTED SO IT IS TRUE THAT THE WHEN WE STARTED OUR STAFFING. MODEL WE DID LOOK TO MASSACHUSETTS I THINK WE'VE ALL RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA'S QUITE A BIT LARGER THAN THAN MASSACHUSETTS AND BELIAU ALSO NOTED THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROGRAM SO THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO IS TO- REALLY BEND THE COST CURVE AND WE THINK THAT OUR MODEL IS IT. IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF HEALTHCARE- IN CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA COMPUTER SYSTEMS WERE HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL IF YOU WOULD LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTION HAD FOR. MONTHS AND I COULDN'T BE MORE. IMPRESSED BY BY STAFF ABILITY TO BUILD SYSTEMS VERY QUICKLY AND VERY EFFICIENTLY SO THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE A CONSUMER FACING- HELP OF COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WOULD HAVE AN APP ON A PHONE UP FOR EXAMPLE. BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING NEW SYSTEMS THAT INTERFACE WITH WITH THE HEALTH PLANS WITH THE PROVIDERS TECH TO CAPTURE THEIR DATA SO I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT- IN MY TEAM'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED ON THE DATA FRONT. ANNUAL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SHARE THE DATA BACK AND FORTH IN AND DO THE THINGS INSTEAD OF BEING STUCK IN A. FILE LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST DECADE. AB WE- I'M HAD A REALLY FROM. AND SIX IN HER OF SHOWING OUR DATA WE HAVE MANY MANY DASHBOARDS- ON OUR SYSTEM AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU OR YOUR STAFF. SHOWING THE MULTITUDE OF DATA SETS THAT ARE ARE AVAILABLE. FILE I'M SURE SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE- QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO DASHBOARDS SO ALL OF THE MENTOR. OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. WHAT ABOUT THAT YOU AYE DIRECTOR LANCE BERG- OBVIOUSLY OUR OFFICE IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOURS AS WE AS WE WORK ON THE ON THE POLICY HERE- AND I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW. I GUESS I'LL JUST PUT MY TWO CENTS INTO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CONCERNS ABOUT DATA- I WOULD SAY THAT HE AS WE LOOK AT THIS THERE'S A LOT OF DATA SYSTEMS ALREADY OUT THERE THAT THIS THIS OFFICE WILL DRAW UPON EXISTING DATA SYSTEMS- THAT DON'T REQUIRE THE KIND OF CONNECTIVE ITTY N. AND INTERACTIVE NEWS THAT YOU MIGHT MIGHT THINK MIGHT NEED TO HAPPEN. THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE WILL COME ONLINE IN IN IN- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT WILL BE A HUGE SOURCE OF INFORMATION THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING BILLED AS WE FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THAT FROM SCRATCH- AND THAT'S GONNA BE A HUGE BASIS OF INFORMATION FOR THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WHICH WILL ALSO CREATE ITS OWN SEPARATE DATA SYSTEM. AS WELL SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE RELYING THE OPERATION OF THIS OFFICE WILL BE RELYING ON ON ON OTHER SYSTEMS PER SE IS GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN ITS OWN SYSTEM AND THE DATA WILL BE COMING FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN BUILT A BILL BY OSP PAD SO. SO I THINK THAT IT IS DIFFERENT THAN AND LOOK TRUST TRUST ME I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION ON SOME OF OUR OTHER DATA SYSTEMS I THINK IT'S THE FACT OF HAVING THAT PUBLIC SO THE UBLIC CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE AND- UNDERSTAND THAT COMPREHENSIVELY VERSUS. JUST A HEY WE'RE BUILDING A SYSTEM. WELL I THINK THAT ARE THE CA. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE HERE IS THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO BE- TYPICALLY CONSUMABLE BY THE PUBLIC. THE IDEA IS TO- IS TO HAVE A GROUP OF EXPERTS- THE ANALYZE THE DATA. AND MAKE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THERE WON'T BE APPS THERE WILL BE THAT KIND OF THAT KIND OF THING. OUT THERE FOR THE CONSUMERS TO LOOK AT- THERE WILL BE HEARINGS- WITH- THE AND THERE WILL ALSO BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AS WELL SO THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW THIS WON'T BE LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE A LAB TEST. RIGHT CAN GO ON MY PHONE AND GET SEE THE RESULTS OF MY OF MY BLOOD WORK IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF THING THIS IS. A MUCH MORE GLOBAL AND COMPREHENSIVE- DATA THAT'S- QUITE FRANKLY GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF A LOT OF EFFORT TO PUT TOGETHER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEVEN MONITORS FONG THE STAFF QUESTIONS WHATEVER THE CHAIR WITH LIKE. LET'S BEGIN WITH THAT NOW AND THEN I WILL ASK MY QUESTIONS AFTER THAT IF I CAN DIRECTOR. OKAY SO QUESTION ONE WE WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE ANY CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE PROPOSAL SINCE JANUARY SO WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN FULLER FROM COLLABORATING WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHAT'S OFFICE AND TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT OUR PROPOSED OFFICE AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE AS WE WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES. BUT I DO WANT TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE MAJOR AREAS. WHERE WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT. A MAJOR CONCERN REPORT RELATES TO THE DATA DURING THE RECORDING TIMELINE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. SO WE'VE HEARD VERY LOUD AND CLEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- AND SO FOLKS HAVE PERSUASIVELY NOTED THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE USING THE CURRENT. YEAR DATA SAYS THAT OUR BASELINE. AT THE SAME TIME WE THINK HAVING DATA FROM THE PANDEMIC TIME FRAME WILL BE USEFUL FOR ANALYSIS SO WE AGREED TO HAVE THE OFFICE COLLECT AGGREGATE DATA. ON THE TOTAL COST OF CARE 420-192-2020 ONE- AND TO REPORT ON THIS. AND THEN THE BASELINE DATA. IS BEING PUSHED OUT- TWO YEARS TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO ESTABLISH THE BASELINE ANY CAN BE RECORDED ON. AND THEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DATE WOULD BE THE FIRST SET OF DATA THAT WILL BE MEASURED AGAINST A TOP COST TARGET. AND THEN FINALLY WE'VE AGREED TO PUSH OUT BY TWO YEARS THE SPECIFIC TARGETS BY HEALTHCARE. SECTOR AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION. WE'VE ALSO OVER IF YOU ON THE COMPASS OF THE ADVISORY. AND I ARE LOOKING AT ADDING TWO MORE MEMBERS WHICH WOULD BRING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO ELEVEN. ONE MEMBER WOULD REPRESENT A PURCHASER OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OR BENEFITS WHO ALSO HAS EXPERIENCE IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY FINANCING. MANAGEMENT OR ADMINISTRATION. THE OTHER WOULD BE TO ADD THE CALPERS CHIEF HEALTH DIRECTOR OR DOES IT NEED TO THE FORT. AND ON THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGETS WE AGREE WITH CLARIFYING THAT THE OUSTED DIRECTOR CAN ADJUST COST TARGETS BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION SUBREGION AND SECTORS. ON AND FORCE MEANT WE HAD ALWAYS AND WE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE INTENDED- TO HAVE A PROGRESSIVE APPROACH TO ENFORCEMENT BUT AGREED TO PUT LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL CLARIFYING THAT THE OFFICE WOULD ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS IN A PROGRESSIVE MANNER. THE WILL OF SEEK TO ASSIST HEALTHCARE ENTITIES TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE INCLUDING THROUGHOUT REACH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES UNLESS THE VIOLATION IS EGREGIOUSFOR EXAMPLE REPEATED FAILURE TO FILE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. ANHALTER PAYMENT MODELS WE'VE AGREED THAT THE OFFICE SHOULD REVIEW THOSE STANDARDS AT LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS TO DETERMINE IF THE STANDARDS ARE DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY COST EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE CARE AND HEALTH CARE IT'S AN EVER CHANGING AREA AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- RELYING ON THE MOST. RECENT MODELS AND RESEARCH. AND FOR. PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE ALSO AGREE WITH REQUIRING THE SPENDING BENCHMARKS FOR PRIMARY CARE TO CONSIDER CURRENT AND FORMER UNDER FUNDING OF PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. ON HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE STABILITY WE AGREE THAT IN PURSUING AFFORDABILITY WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BOTH MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND RESPECTS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE CLARIFICATIONS AS TO WHAT THE OFFICES ROLE WOULD BE WITH RESPECT TO CONSOLIDATION. MAKING CLEAR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THOSE THAT HAVE EXISTING JURISDICTIONS OVER HEALTH CARE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THIS WILL HELP REDUCE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND ALLOW THE OFFICE TO FOCUS ON GAPS IN REVIEW. SO THAT'S THE SUMMARY- OF ISSUES WE'VE WORKED OUT WHICH REFLECTS TREMENDOUS ENGAGEMENT BY ALL PARTIES I'M IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND- AS I BEGIN MY COMMENTS TODAY I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT ACTUALLY. THANK ARE CALLING ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR WORKING ON THIS I KNOW WE HAVE BEGAN THIS CONVERSATION WHEN WE WORKED ON A SELECT COMMITTEE AND- YOUR PERSISTENCE AS WELL NOTED HERE AND APPRECIATE- IF I COULD ONLY HAVE THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU DIRECTOR RIGHT I WANTED TO GET IN ABOUT THE SILO VERSUS COLLABORATIVE. NATURE OF SETTING TARGETS FOR SECTORS. I WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE DON'T SHIFT COSTS OF FOR. A LOOKING AT CERTAIN SECTORS AND POTENTIALLY NOT OTHERS AND HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE A COLLABORATIVE. ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO ABOVE AND APPROACH HERE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BOTH LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AND HAVE- SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND GOALS FOR TOTAL COST OF CARE. BUT ALSO TO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD IT'S AT WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE COST DRIVERS ARE THERE PRIMARILY WITH HOSPITALS WHAT PROVIDERS WITH TECHNOLOGY WITH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT IS OUR HOPE IS AGAIN WITH TRANSPARENCY REPORTING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW COSTS ARE CHANGING OVER TIME BUT ALSO WE DO VERY MUCH WANT TO HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IS A PATH AS OPPOSED TO A SILENT APPROACH- WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL SPUR ADDITIONAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE. INDUSTRY TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE COST TARGETS THAT ARE SET- AGAIN I'M JUST KNOW THE ADVISORY BOARD IS GOING TO PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE- IN IN HAVING ECONOMIC EXPERTISE AND HAVING EXPERTISE ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- AND HOW IT FUNCTIONS. AND SO WE HAVE FAITH IN IN THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS THE ABILITY FOR ALL OF THE PARTIES TO BE AT THE TABLE I'M CONTRIBUTING AND FOR THE ADVISORY BOARD CHAT TAKE THAT INPUT AS THEY PICK WHAT WHAT ECONOMIC INDICATORS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR HEALTHCARE. AND WHAT CONDITIONS- ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WE WOULD. BE HERE WITH THE PANDEMIC AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE COSTS AND SO WE WOULD IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO BE AGILE ENOUGH TO ADJUST. AS CONDITIONS CHANGE- HELLO THOSE LINES COMMUTER. COMMENT YOU BROUGHT UP THE- BOARD I'M TRY TO. REALLY HAVE A CLARIFICATION BETWEEN THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE AND THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND- HOW THAT INTERFACE WILL WORK AND HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON. SURE I THINK OF IT IN PART- YOU KNOW COVER CALIFORNIA BOARD I THINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR US AS A RECENT HEALTHCARE ENTITY- WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT STAFF THAT'S DOING A LOT OF WORK THAT'S DIRECTLY NEGOTIATING. WITH HEALTH PLANS IT'S COLLECTING DATA THAT'S DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY- BUT THERE ARE KEY POLICY DECISIONS THAT WILL BOTH THERE'S AN ASPECT OF PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND HAVING A BOARD. AND HAVING PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD ABOUT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS- IN TERMS OF THE COVER CALIFORNIA. AND NOW. NOT REGIONAL LIKE HAVING EXPERTS IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD I CAN HEAR THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE SOME OF THE KEY HOLE SO THE CONCEPT OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING ECONOMISTS- TOURNEY'S RESEARCHERS A DATA COLLECTION EXPERTS STATE AUDITORS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE DATA PIECES RIGHT THAT WE'RE BUILDING A SYSTEM. I'M DOING THE ACTUARIAL AND OTHER TYPES OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND- THAT FORECASTING THAT WE NEED TO DO- AND TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO THE BOARD BUT BUT BY VIRTUE OF. OF PRESENTING IT TO THE BOARD ALSO IT'S PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT- AND THEN THE BOARD IS ABLE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION. DIRECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THEY MAY WANT AND- VOTE OF FIVE MAJORITY ON THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC INDICATOR FOR THE COST TARGET SO I THINK IT'S A- GOOD MODEL IN TERMS OF HAVING A STAFF EXPERTISE. WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND THEN ALSO HAVING THE EXPERTISE ON THE BOARD WITH A BROADER VIEW- AND. PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CAR USE THE ADVISER BOARD KEEP. TO AND- ANYTIME ALSO THE LEGISLATURE ARE EMPOWERING NEW NON ELECTED BOARD IT'S- HARD. FOR US TO HAVE THE TRUST AND FAITH- BUT KNOWING YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT ON MORE THAN ABLE AND WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND BE COLLABORATIVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S- REFLECTIVE OF ALL OF OUR VALUES. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ROLE IS BETTER DEFINED AND WE HAS THE LEGISLATURE. DID NOT ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY- BUT STILL-HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERFACE AND PARTICIPATE IN THOSE KEY POLICY DECISIONS AS THEY'RE COMING POINT. SO WHERE'S THE KEEP POLICY DECISION WILL BE TO SET THE COST TARGET ITSELF- BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR. FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND. AND WE WILL NOT. IF QUESTION IF I CAN ANIMAL MOVE ON. WITH THE AGENDA- YOU YOU HAD SAID EARLIER IT'S A- NOT A LOW COST LOW VALUE SYSTEM AND IT DOES NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY. SOMEONE WHO SPENT MOST OF THEIR LIFE FIGHTING FOR HEALTH EQUITY. IT'S- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT WE ARE NOT SPEAKING IN THE DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT- POPULATIONS WHO ARE VULNERABLE OR- THAT WERE WORKING ON THEM AND WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REGULARLY KNOW IF YOUR COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA- IT'S CERTAINLY ONE THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND I SHARE WITH YOU AND SO I THINK. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST THIS IS AN AREA THAT NEEDS MORE DEVELOPMENT BUT I WANT TO STATE AT THE OUTSET THE WERE VERY COMMITTED TO NOT LOCKING IN INEQUITIES AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW AS YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT WERE VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO MEASURE. QUALITY AND EQUITY METRICS ALONG THE WAY SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO A RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHICH IS THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO- BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY FIGURED OUT IS HOW NOT TO TAKE IT AND IN EQUITY RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE. A MEDICAL GROUP FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS PROVIDING VERY FISHING CARE- THEY SAID THEY WON'T BE LIMITED BY BY THEIR STARTING POINT AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO START LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF ADDRESSING THAT AND VERY MUCH WELCOME. STAKEHOLDER ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER INPUT SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT- WE THINK BECAUSE THERE IS SOME ABILITY TO SET DIFFERENT TARGETS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA- AND BY SECTOR ONE PICKED COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE THERE'S A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT HASN'T BEEN HASN'T HAD SUFFICIENT INVESTMENT- IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND WE WOULD WANT FOR EXAMPLE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL GROWTH IN THAT AREA FOR EXAMPLE BUT VERY OPEN TO HAVING THIS ONGOING DISCUSSION HEARING FOLKS SPECIFIC THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. YEAH I'D LOVE TO FOLLOW UP YOU HAD SAID QUALITY AND EQUITY WILL COME THROUGH PERFORMANCE METRICS AND SO WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT SPECIFIC METRICS YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT- BUT WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR FOR- PRESENTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND- SEE IF THERE ARE ANY FINAL. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH. THANK YOU DR. I YOU AND I'M LIST CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY BE WE'RE WORK ON THIS. BILL WELL. I WAS I NOTED YOU SAID YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WANT THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED IN POLICY. YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT POLICY DECISIONS MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE- MY KID. THE AND THE EXPERTISE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS DEPARTMENT- IS SIGNIFICANT AND THESE WILL THESEGOALS WILL NOT BE ARRIVED AT LIGHTLY SO THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ANALYZE THIS AT THAT LEVEL IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS THEY'RE WORKING HAND IN HAND ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THIS SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD NEGOTIATE AS A LEGISLATURE THESE GOALS I THINK WOULD BE A HUGE DISSERVICE TO THE OFFICE AND THE EXPERTISE OF THE PEOPLE WORKING HERE. AND POTENTIALLY POLITICIZED AS THIS SIGNIFICANTLY AS INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES MIGHT DECIDE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT GOAL AND THEY WANT TO ENGAGE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO DON'T KNOW EVEN HOW THE DATA WAS EN MASSE TO PUT THIS TOGETHER SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T TIP THE SCALES. IN A POLITICAL WAY- TO BENEFIT CERTAIN PLAYERS OR WHOEVER MIGHT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING HERE TO NOTE ALSO IS THAT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE AND I THINK IT'S BEING PRESENTED BY BY SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO WHO OPPOSE WHAT WE'RE DOING OR HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE NEED PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND OPERATE DIFFERENTLY AND IF WE WERE GOING THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY- THERE'S SIGNIFICANT WASTE AND HEALTH CARE. HUGE AMOUNTS OF WASTE AND HEALTH CARE WE KNOW THAT JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION POINTED THAT OUT VERY DIRECTLY- AND SO IF WE CAN JUST GET PEOPLE. EVEN JUST A FOCUS ON SOME OF THAT BENDING THE HEALTHCARE COST CURVE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT THERE WE GOT TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT. AS FAR AS INEQUITIES TRUST ME YOU AND I HAVE VERY VERY CHALLENGING DISTRICTS TO REPRESENT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD JUST AS YOU. WANT ME WERE BOTH THE LAST TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO WANNA DO ANYTHING. THAT EXACERBATES ALREADY EXISTING EQUITIES IN IN CONTRAST WE WANT TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE. AND THAT'S WHY ENHANCEMENTS ON. PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- AND REGION ALITY OURS ARE SO CRITICAL TO THIS PROCESS AND SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE HERE AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE PROCESS. THANK YOU THE OTHER FINAL COMMENTS. WITH THAT I WILL THANK- THIS PANEL AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM THREE WHICH IS WITH THE SAME PANEL THAT'S NOW ON THE PROPOSAL TO RECAST AND MODERNIZED AUSPICE CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LANCE BURKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- AS INDICATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET OFFICE GROWING PORTFOLIO MAKES THE TIME TO RECAST OPTION AND IT'S THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE'VE GIVEN CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO HOW TO DO THAT AS WELL AS REVIEWED OUR PROGRAMS FOR AREAS WHERE WE CAN STRENGTHEN THEM SO WHEN I FIRST GOT THE ARCH HEAD WE- SPEND A LOT OF TIME REVIEWING THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT. L. A. R. REPORTS AND OTHER ACADEMIC AND POLICY REPORTS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. THANK WE ALSO DIDN'T OF STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNAL. THE HOLDERS AND ALL OF THOSE INPUTS INFORMED THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS THE FIRST STEP QUESTION REGARDING ARTICLES WITH THE RECAST AFTER THE OVER ARCHING GOALS ARE TO IMPROVE ITS EFFECTIVENESS PROVIDING THE DATA VISION AND PROGRAMS DEVELOPED TO DEVELOP THE STATE'S NEEDED HELP WORKFORCE WHICH VERY MUCH MEANS BOTH DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE INCREASED WORKFORCE. IN UNDER A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS WERE ALSO LOOKING FOR. OUR DATA SYSTEMS. A CLEAR VIEW ONE WORD FROM THE STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS OUR CONSULTANT CONDUCTED. STAKEHOLDERS WANT TO SEE OFFICE SERVING AS A CONVENER AND THOUGHT LEADER ON HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THAT ROLE ON HEALTHCARE ACCESS THAT INFORMATION. THEY'RE JUST GOING THROUGH EACH OF THE SPECIFIC- COMPONENTS OF OUR PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS TO RECAST AND EXPAND THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE CLEARING HOUSE AS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE RESEARCH AND DATA CENTER- WE HAVE NOT HAD THE DATA THAT WE NEED IT IN CALIFORNIA TO REALLY ADEQUATELY ANALYZE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE THAT WAS NOTED AND- UCSF- POLICY REPORT FOR EXAMPLE- WE PROPOSE REQUIRING ALL HEALTH LICENSING BOARDS. TO COLLECT OF COURSE THAT A FEDERALLY RECOMMENDED DATA ELEMENTS FOR HEALTH WORKFORCE ANALYSIS- WERE AWARE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAKING HAS A BILL WITH A SIMILAR CALL. THE RESEARCH AND DATA CENTER WOULD TAKE THAT DATA- AND OTHER DATA INPUTS. TO PROVIDE TIMELIER AND BETTER DATA AND ANALYSIS TO INFORM STATE POLICY REGARDING ISSUES OF WORKFORCE SHORTAGE EQUITY AND DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS PROVIDING DATA TO THE NEW OFFICE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY IF IT'S APPROVED AND H. P. PROGRAM. THE RESOURCES REQUESTED HERE WILL ALLOW US TO PERFORM VALUABLE TESTING OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OSMAN'S WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND INFORM POLICY. AND PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS. AND THEN TURNING NECK TO THE MIDDLE OF ACTUAL FOR- WE WOULD STREAMLINE. OUR FROM AT INSTEAD A NEW SINGLE STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL IN LIEU OF OUR CURRENT HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION. AND THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION. SO WE'RE SEEKING EFFICIENCY AND OPERATING OUR PROGRAMS- BUT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY RUN FIRE FOUNDATION TO SWITCH TO RUNNING THOSE PROGRAMS INTERNALLY WHILE MAINTAINING THE LICENSING REVENUE STREAMS BUT DISCONTINUING THE NONPROFIT FOUNDATION COMPONENTS. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO TRANSITION THE CURRENT SONG BROWN COMMISSION TO A NEW HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON STATEWIDE EDUCATION AND HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING NEEDS ACROSS KEY AREAS INCLUDING GENERAL POSITION EDUCATIONAL PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WOULD ADVISE ON INCREASING THE SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY OF BOTH PHYSICIAN AND NON PHYSICIAN PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE PLACEMENT OF PROVIDERS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS WOULD IMPLEMENT ONE OF THE TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION. THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER THE COUNCIL POLICY- DIRECTION AS WE ADMINISTER OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT BOARD AND COMMISSION PROVIDE DIRECTION ON A SUBSET OF OFFICE PROGRAMS MEETING THAT TODAY NO ONE ENTITY HAS BEEN ANALYZING- ADVISING ON THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF OUR PROGRAMS WERE COORDINATING WITH OTHER STATE ENTITIES. SO WE'RE EXCITED TO- TO MAINTAIN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS- BUT HAVE A NEW UNIFIED ADVISORY BODY INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT MORE FRACTURED APPROACH. NEXT FOR PROPOSING TO INTEGRATE THE STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH AND THE J. ONE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM INTO OFFICE PRIMARY CARE OFFICE- THIS WOULD PROVIDE A CENTRALIZED AND BETTER BETTER TARGETED APPROACH TO WORKING WITH RURAL COMMUNITIES ON THEIR HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND WE WOULD DO SO WITH FEWER STAFF BY LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING PRIMARY CARE OFFICE INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION OUR EXPERTISE MAKES US WELL SUITED TO ADMINISTER THE J. ONE VISA PROGRAM WHICH ASSISTS DOCTORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN OBTAINING A J. ONE VISA WAIVER TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO STRENGTHEN SEVERAL OF OUR DATA PROGRAMS- WE'RE PROPOSING TO UPDATE OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST TRANSPARENCY STATUE SB SEVENTEEN. TO ADD DATA POINTS THAT HELP IDENTIFY THE THERAPEUTIC TYPE OF DRUG FACTORS DESCRIBING THE REASON FOR A PRICE INCREASE REASONS FOR NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION AND CLEAR AUTHORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ASSESS REPORTING FOR COMPLETENESS. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY AND COMPLETENESS BY CLARIFYING DEFINITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING AND ADDING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT COMPARISONS OF BRAND VERSUS GENERIC DRUGS- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO AMEND THE STATUTES PERTAINING TO CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT OUTCOMES. REPORTING TO PROVIDE. US BETTER AND THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO PERFORM OUTCOMES REPORTING FOR NEW AND EMERGING CARDIAC PROCEDURES SUCH AS TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT. AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE LOOKING TO UPDATE STATUTES PERTAINING TO VITAL STATISTICS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING BIRTH AND DEATH DATA- IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER SO THAT WE CAN DO THE PUBLIC REPORTING AND RESEARCH. SUCH AS ANALYSIS OF MATERNAL QUALITY OF CARE AND INPATIENT MORTALITY. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOR US- AS WE GRADUATE TO THE DEPARTMENT WE PROPOSED A NAME CHANGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION. SO WE THINK WITH THE ADDITION OF THE NEW DATA PROGRAMS ARE EXPANSION OUR WORKFORCE- THAT OUR CURRENT NAME DOESN'T REFLECT OUR MERGING HEALTH POLICY LEADERSHIP ROLE. SO WE CAN BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE NAMES IS THAT PART OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION OR H. KAIT- THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK INCENTIVIZE ACTS WITH HEALTH CARE. ACCESS TO SAFE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES TO AN ADEQUATE WORKFORCE THAT MEETS CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY CARE. TO FINANCING FOR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND COLLECTING AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES FACILITIES WORKFORCE AND FINANCE. SO THAT'S THE OVERVIEW. ARE WE CAN. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CORY HARSHA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULATORY ISSUE TO FROM THE ILIO- WE JUST HAVE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSED NEW DEPARTMENT- GENERALLY WE DON'T HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS TO RAISE WITH THE RECASTING OF OUR SPEND JUST A FEW CONSIDERATIONS TO BRING UP YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THE GOALS OF ESTABLISHING NEW DEPARTMENT- WHICH ARE GENERALLY TO ESTABLISH AN APARTMENT WITH A STRONGER CAPACITY FOR BOTH. RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF STATE HELP HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE USE AND AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS MAKES SENSE. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE ADDITION OF THE PROPOSED OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY DISCUSSED EARLIER- FURTHERMORE WE FIND AT THIS OFFICE DOES PREVENT AND- DOES PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. ALL THE ADMINISTRATION MORE ACCOUNTABLE ON ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS AFFORDABILITY IN THE COLLECTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION- THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR WORKFORCE RELATED ISSUES- ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATION- WHICH ALSO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. I WHICH INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULDN'T FULLY CONSOLIDATE THIS RESPONSIBILITY INTO ONE DEPARTMENT. WITH THIS RECASTING THE NEW DEPARTMENT WOULD PRESENT ITSELF AS A CENTRAL POINT OF CONTACT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THESE ISSUES WHICH MAY HELP FACILITATE ACCOUNTABILITY. ESPECIALLY IN RECEIVING EVALUATION MATERIALS FROM THE NEW DEPARTMENT- HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. NEW DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT IT DOES- IN FACT- END UP HAVING ACCESS TO. IMPROVED EVALUATION MATERIALS- AS A RESULT OF THAT- PROPOSED ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION CAPABILITIES IN THIS DEPARTMENT- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OFFICES COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. C. NON I WILL ASK IF I CAN- DIRECTOR LANDSBERG I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL I'VE BEEN. VERY INTERESTED IN TRACKING HOW THE DEPARTMENT MEASURES OUTCOMES AND HEALTH% CARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU COULD COMMENT ON HOW THIS CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE OR DIVERSIFY OUR HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO WON A CALL AND KAREN MYSELF MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WORK FORCE- TO ADD PIECES CHáVEZ BUT I THINK THE FIRST PIECE TO NOW IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA THAT WE NEED TODAY. TO DO THE EVALUATION DO DO THE PROGRAMMATIC EVALUATION THAT WE WANT TO DO- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NEED AT EVERY LEVEL RIGHT WE NEED TO. HELP OUR KIDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL GET THE ADVANCED SCIENCE CLASSES THAT THEY NEED TO GET INTERESTED IN IN THE HEALTH CARE- PROFESSIONS ALL THE WAY UP TO PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE- GIVE ME DIRECTOR. RIGHT NOW AN OPPORTUNITY IT TO GET MORE A IN. AS WELL.

THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AS WE ARE ENTERING INTO BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE COULD NOT MANUFACTURE ENOUGH PROVIDERS TO TAKE CARE OF US DURING THIS CRISIS HADN'T REALLY LOOKED TO YOUR DEPARTMENT TO HELP US TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN HAVE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

HI THIS IS THIS IS MERRY WATANABE- AGAIN DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE- I WILL SAY I THINK THAT WE INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS BEING PROPOSED WAS THREE YEARS WHICH GAVE US SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE IT POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEEN RE EVALUATED THE MEASURES WITH ONLY ONE YEAR WORTH OF DATA- WERE SUPPORTER BOTH OF THE- RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HEARD TODAY FIVE YEARS- THAT WILL GIVE US MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THE DATA THAT'S COME IN AND LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- I WILL SECCO THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE MANAGED. MEDICARE MANAGED CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS- BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FOR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL FIVE ON TELEHEALTH. WE WILL HAVE. EIGHT SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING WILL LIGHT BORN IN JC COOPER WITH T. H. C. S. COREY HOW SHEILA WITH THE L. A. O. DOCTOR GANGA. HE MIGHT TO LUCKY WITH THE UNITED HEALTH CENTERS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. ROBERT BARDIA WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD CALIFORNIA CENTRAL COAST DAVID FORD WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND. LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LET POINT. YEAH- THE PETER COOPER'S QUICKLY DONE THIS. FOR ALL. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS PRESENTED OUR TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL BROADLY TO THIS GROUP- A FEW TIMES I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL AGAIN- BUT DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE THE FOUR DIVISIONS THAT INCLUDE MODIFICATIONS AND OR EXPANSION OF THE USE OF SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY OTHER VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND TO ADD REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING TO THE GREATER. ALIGNING STANDARDIZED ACROSS ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE WE HAVE PUBLICLY PROVIDED A PRETTY EXTENSIVE PROPOSAL AT THAT PEOPLE COULD REFERENCE- IN REGARDS TO STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS WE DO KNOW THAT THE LARGEST CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED TO THE DEPARTMENT IS IN REGARDS TO A LACK OF PAYMENT PARITY FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES SO ARE PROPOSAL DOES. THAT WE WERE ALLOW FOR ONLY BE PROVIDED AND DON AT U. H. C. A. R. ENVIRONMENTS AT AN ALTERNATIVE A FEE SCHEDULE I'M STILL NOT IN PAYMENT CARRY WITH AN IN PERSON VISIT- IN THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS AROUND- ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER UP FOR OUR FQHC PARTNERS OF THE THAT IS THE MAIN. PIECE THAT HAS KIND OF BEEN RAISED TO THE DEPARTMENT AROUND PAYMENT PARITY I THINK YOU KNOW AS A DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH. BOTH YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS FQHCS OF VARIOUS HEALTH SYSTEMS WE'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF FEEDBACK IN A TO EVALUATE THE GIVEN THE UNDERLYING KIND OF INTENT LEVEL OF CARE PROVIDED VIA TELEPHONIC AUDIO ON THE MODALITIES ON THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES AND THE QUALITY THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR YOUR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY ARE YOU ONLY SERVICES DO NOT REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO MANAGE- THERE ARE- NOT SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OR BROADBAND AS WELL AS THE IT IS LESS COSTLY THAN IN PERSON. VISITS ON THAT IS NAY DID SO THEREFORE THE- AS DOUBLE THAT LOWER. RATES IS APPROACH FOR. PROVIDED VIA TO IN AUDIO SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE I YOU. TO LOOK AT- THE DATA THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE DO KNOW THE U. OF TELEPHONE- AND ONLY A WELL AS JUST HOW HOW WITH ITS- EXPANDED DURING THE HEALTH EMERGENCY- ON AVERAGE WE HAD ABOUT TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN TELEHEALTH VISITS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES. PER MONTH COMPARED TO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED TELEHEALTH VISITS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES PER MONTH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN REGARDS TO THE USE OF TELEHEALTH. DEPARTMENT IF KNOWLEDGE IS THE BENEFITS OF AUDIO ALL THE AUDIO ONLY SERVICES NO IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS. THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO USE WITHIN- THE ACCESS POINTS FOR BENEFICIARIES FOR REALLY EMPATHIZING ALSO THE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT IN PERSON CARE WHICH IS SO CRITICAL FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY. OF OUTCOMES IN THE TOUCHPOINTS WITH POSITIONS WHICH IS CRITICAL THOUGHTS ABOUT FINDING THAT BALANCE. ADDITIONALLY ARE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TELEHEALTH VISITS WE CONTINUE TO KIND OF LOOK AT OUR DATA UP FROM MANY ANGLES AND LOOK FOR TO CONVERSATIONS. WITH INDIVIDUALS REGARDING NOT. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS- OF. THE CALL. A HOW THE IS LOOKING AT- ACTUATES THE IN REGARD TO THE RE. RATE AS IN IN THE PROPOSED- CMS HAD GIVEN AT THE DEPARTMENT CLEAR GUIDANCE- IF EIGHTY ARE YOU ONLY A TO BE A LAW AND HAVE TO SEE THE WOULD BE. BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. OF THAT AT THE FUTURE RATE- AND WE WERE CONSIDER ALL- PAYMENT METHOD. OF IS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD COMMERCE. THAT HAVE PUT OFF THE TABLE- SOME OPTIONS FOR ACCURACY THE ROLE HEALTH CLINICS WE'VE ALSO BEEN ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH YEAH THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW. AND WHAT WE COULD DO IN THE STATE THE FOR NOT PAYING THE PPS- HOWEVER WOULD JUST WANT TO REINFORCE THAT THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YEAH MATH. OF DH CS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FQHCS AT PAYMENT PARITY FOR TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY OUR CURRENT AVERAGE OF READY IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN. DOLLARS PER VISIT. IF WE WERE TO EXPLORE AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY WITH THE CLINICS WHICH WE ARE EXPLORING THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL- IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE CLINIC HE- YOU KNOW IN AGREEMENT WITH US TO WAIVE THEIR PPS SO. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT WITH THAT HUGE SPEEDS UP FOR AUDIO ONLY THAT CLINICS WOULD HAVE TO AGREE THE INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WAIVE PPS. AND IF THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT WOULD ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE M. S. TO GET THAT WAIVER APPROVAL AND TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE HE MEANT. FOR AUDIO ONLY. OF THE DEPARTMENT HAS SHOWN OUR COMMITMENT TO ENGAGING THERE WE HAVE RAISED THAT IT MAY BE CONCERNED WITH GETTING CMS APPROVAL ON THAT FRONT. BUT STILL COMMITTED TO FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE CAN OFFER AUDIO ONLY FOR NON FTC'S TO HAVE AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT. RECOMMENDATION IN REGARDS TO THE COST ETIMATE- ON THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN. AB THIRTY TWO WHAT I WOULD SAY THEY IS THAT- THE IMPACT OF AB THIRTY TWO IS. A AT THIS BUT WILL FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE- REGARDING THAT AND FUTURE. BUT THE THING THAT. AND HAPPY TO ANY. WE IT IS TIME. THANK YOU CAN A NEXT WILL FROM. HOW SHE DOES WITH THE L. THANK YOU DR REGULAR ISSUE THAT WITH THE- L. A. O. ON THIS ISSUE WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO RELEASE A MELODRAMATIC CAL TELEHEALTH PUBLICATION IN THE COMING DAYS- THIS THIS POST IS GENERALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- WHICH OF COURSE MAY OR MAY NOT CHANGE AT ME REVISED BUT WE INTEND FOR THIS PEACE TO- ALSO PROVIDE OUR COMMENTARY ON THE BROADER POLICY ISSUE ESPECIALLY GIVEN- LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. ON HOW MANY CAL TELEHEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE SET GOING FORWARD- THE POST WILL HAVE SOME FURTHER ANALYSIS BUT GENERALLY WE FIND THAT THERE'S A LOT ABOUT TELEHEALTH THAT IS NOT NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD- WHILE THERE IS SOME AVAILABLE RESEARCH ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES. THE FISCAL IMPACT OF TELEHEALTH EXPANSIONS AND- THE IMPACT OF TELEHEALTH EXPANSIONSON ACCESS TO CARE THESE REVIEWS ARE OFTEN NARROWLY FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC HEALTHCARE SERVICE TYPES OR THE MODALITY THROUGH WHICH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED- SUCH AS LIVE VIDEO OR AUDIO ONLY. GIVEN THIS IT'S DIFFICULT TO GENERALIZE FINDINGS ABOUT TELEHEALTH BROADLY- AND IN ADDITION THERE'S A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT HOW TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION- IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED GOING FORWARD ONCE THE COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC ENDS- WE HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THE SETTING OF DIFFERENTIAL PAYMENT RATES BY TELEHEALTH SERVICE- ON A PERMANENT BASIS- THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN. TELEHEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR A CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES BUT NOT OTHERS DEPENING ON WHERE THE AXIS CARE- SINCE CERTAIN SERVICES WOULD NOT BE COVERED AT HEALTH CENTERS- IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTION THAT PUTS TELEHEALTH POLICY- WOULD BE COST NEUTRAL GIVEN POTENTIAL INCREASES IN ACCESS TO CARE- AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION- THOSE THOSE ARE OFFICES COME WITH AT THIS TIME BUT AGAIN WE HAVE AN UPCOMING PUBLICATION THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE ANALYSIS AND- WE'RE VERY VERY CLOSE TO GETTING THAT OUT. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE. FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DOCTOR WHO MENTAL IT. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHECK OUT DR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME- MY NAME IS GOING TO HIM WITHIN A COMMA INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN. I'M CURRENTLY THE CHIEF MEDICAL% OFFICER OF THE UNITED HEALTH CENTERS IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH IS A NONPROFIT- AFFECT ANY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER. THAT PROVIDE UP TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND- ANDROID- BOTH RURAL HI YOUR OWN AS WELL AS A BUTTON- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY- SO- I'VE BEEN A PRIVATE ACCOUNT. FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THANKS TO. PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE TO MY- MY PACE. ARE IN PAIN FOR THE YEAR I'VE- DELIVER MIGHT PRIME CAP TELEPHONICALLY SEEING- IN ALL TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY. MINUTES A DAY AND WHEN I WOKE UP YEAH FULL FULL FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ON COMMITTEES DIFFICULTY COMING IN DURING THE CALL TODAY. NOT JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY WHICH IS A TEENY BIT IMPORTANT TO THE TOPIC. I CAME TO THE UNITED HEALTH CENTERS FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS PASSED. AT MY LAST JOB I WAS THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER WILL BE A NEWIN GOOD HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WHIPPED BOAT EIGHT TEACHING HOSPITALS IN SIX NEW ENGLAND STATES AND- DURING THE TIME. WE WERE EXTENSIVELY UTILIZING TELEHEALTH- WE STARTED USING TWENTY AT THE TWO THOUSAND SIX IN THE VA. ARE SPECIALLY NEW ENGLAND WITH THE COLD WINTERS COME SO A LOT OF GUYS DELIVERED BY TELEHEALTH TO AVOID THAT THESE VETERANS FROM DRIVING IN IN IN AND SNOW AND ICE AND I. WAS ALSO AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH. WELL IN. A LOT OF THE WORK IS DONE FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND ATTEND HEALTH IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AREAS WE HAVE THE. HIGHLY HIGHLY ENCOURAGE. NOW I TO- UNITED HEALTH SAID DOES HE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS OVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. PATIENTS SERVED WE HAVE. ABSOLUTELY ZERO- ABSOLUTELY A NORTEL HEALTH AT ALL AND I DID FIND OUT WHY AND THE REASON IS HAVING NO POLICIES PROCEEDING AS- NO INCENTIVES NO FINDING MORE STRUCTURE TO. IN A BILL FOR THE SERVICE AS AN ABSOLUTELY- NO REASON. FOR THE AYE HEALTH CENTERS TO ENGAGE IN GETTING AT NINETY ONE FALL MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS A SAD SITUATION. SEOUL THANK IN CORBY- AS SOON AS THE COLD WE'D HATE. SUDDENLY WE- WE GOT THE PERMISSION THE GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND DO TELEHEALTH BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE. WILL WILL BECOME AVAILABLE WITH WITH THE FACE TO FACE ENCOMPASS- AND- ESTABLISHED ENORMOUS THREAT. OFF A SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND ALSO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. SO WHAT DID WE DO. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN B. BUG FOR A DAY OR TWO THE RIGHT POLICIES PRESIDIO'S. TREND OUR DOCTORS. OF THE WENT IMMEDIATELY. TO COMPLETE. TELEHEALTH AND PRIVATE TELEPHONIC TECH. OUR AS YOU KNOW MOST OF OUR PATIENTS THE HAVE A MAX TO COME YOU KNOW THE DON'T HAVE AG TO SMARTPHONES THEY HAVE JUST SIMPLE FEAT FORMS AND AN OLDER FASHION FORMS OF PRETTY MUCH FORTY ONLY. AND THEN MOST OF THESE RURAL AREAS EVEN BETTER DOESN'T WORK SO THEY THEY RELY ON THE OLD YOUR COMMUNICATION. AND I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD. I'M HAPPY TO SAY. THE CHANGE WAS. RECEIVED EXTREMELY WELL BY OUR PATIENTS THAT I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER SPECIALLY IN PRIMARY CARE THE QUALITY WAS MAINTAINED. I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF THE TIME WE DON'T HAVE TO EXAMINE THE PATIENT HAD TO TALK. TO PROVIDE THE CARE THEY NEED. WE HAVE SEEN THE PATIENT BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE MOST OF THEM HAVE CHRONIC PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW WE CAN ADJUST THE MEDICATIONS WE CAN GIVE THEM BLOOD PRESSURE METERS AND HAVE THEM CHECKED ABOUT PUSH APPLE. WE CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS BY TALKING TO THEM CAN FIFTEEN MINUTES. LISTENING TO THEM FINDING OUT ADVISING. THAT'S HOW THE TELEPHONIC MEDICINE BOOKS. TELL. SO THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN OUR IN OUR PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE- MORE OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY WHICH IS KIND A NOVEL TO THE- THE THAT VERY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS BUT IT WAS NOT NOVEL TO THE VA WAS OUR NEED TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NEED TO HAVE PROCESSORS AND NEED TO HAVE INCENTIVES BUILT IN SEOUL WE WOULD BE USING BEST TO IMPROVE ACCESS OF. A CAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE VA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE FROM THE MEDIA THE QUALITY OF CARE HAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPROVED WITH THE UTILIZATION OF TELEPORT SYNCHRONOUS AUDIO VIDEO AS WELL AS HIS THINKING US AS WELL AS HOME TRYING TO HELP. WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR COST OF PL BY DECREASING THE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS DECREASING THE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS BY THE. USE OF TELEHEALTH ALL FORMS OF. AND I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU START. WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE OF TELL DURING THIS CALL PENDANT CAN TELL YOU MY PERSONALLY. TREMENDOUS COST SAVINGS BECAUSE WE CALL THESE PATIENTS WHO GET COOLEY POSITIVE PRETTY MUCH DAILY SOMETIMES THAT'S MEANT THAT MAY BE WHY THERE'S SO MANY VISITS. TELEFONICA'S TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. FINDING OUT WHAT SYMPTOMS THEY HAVE. PRESCRIBING TREATMENTS THAT THEY NEED. REASSURING THAT SAW THEY DON'T RUN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITAL BECAUSE THIS CANNOT. BE PREVENTED THE SUBMISSIONS BY THE TELEFONICA'S REPORT DISABLED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH OTHERWISE SPENT THIS HOSPICE WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED. AND THE PATIENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BECAUSE THEY HAD NO HOSPITAL ACCESS. IF ALL THESE VERSIONS RAN TO THE HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOMS OF THE PREVENT THAT THAT BECAUSE WE USE THE TELEPHONIC SERVICE. TO KEEP THESE PATIENTS HOOKED ON TO ALL PROVIDERS SO DID WILL GET THE CARE AND THE SYSTEM THEY NEED ANYTIME THEY NEED. SALT CALIFORNIA. YEAH AS WELL AS ONE OF TALIA IS. TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO KIA NOT ALL AT THE OF. BUT EVERY DAY AND THAT'S A LESSON WE READ ME TO FROM SIXTY. NOT THEREFORE I'M HERE RESPECTIVE RESPECTFULLY URGING COMMITTEE TO REJECT ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT WOULD DISCONTINUE THE AUDIO ONLY A PAYMENT AFFECTS ABILITY. FOR POST PANDEMIC ERA FOR THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR NOT TO OUR HIGHLY DESERVED. UNDERSERVED PATIENTS. NOW READING UNITED HEALTH CENTERS HAVE PROVIDED. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND RECEIVED DURING THE BAND. FINALLY I WOULD SAY MORE THAN 900005% NOTHING USING TELEPHONE ONLY VISITS. HELLO MORE TENTATIVE IT IS LOW ABOUT QUALITY OF GUYS GOOD OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY AND WE SAVED IT FROM RUNNING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOSPITALS EVEN THOUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE- BIG GET CAUGHT. WE TESTED THEM WE WILL SORT OF ACCIDENT AND MOST OF THESE WITH ITS BUT DONE. BY TELEPHONIC INTERACTIONS. I CAN TELL YOU. MOST OF MY PATIENTS NOW I WORK AT A CLINIC WITH YOU ALL. WHICH IS ALMOST LIKE NOWHERE. AND MOST OF MY PATIENTS HAVE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES. IN TRANSPORTATION THEY DON'T HAVE COSTS. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE YOU KNOW. WHY I'M INFORMS US. AND SOME OF THEM BUT LONG HOURS INDOORS PACKING HOUSE SERVICE IN THE IN THE FARM FIELDS. MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I CALL THEM FOR THE OBVIOUS IT'S YES THEY ARE WORKING THEY TAKE A BREAK AND CALL YOU KNOW MAKE THE CALL AND I YOU KNOW TAKE OUT THEIR PROBLEMS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TAKE A DAY OFF FROM WORK. THAT IS A TREMENDOUS VALUE BUT THESE. WORKERS WHO ACTUALLY DEPEND ON A SINGLE DAY HAS BECOME BEFORE AS OF THIS BAY TO COMPLICATE THE PROCEDURE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT TELEMEDICINE IS THE ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. HOWEVER KELLY MY THE OLD YOU ONLY TELL ME HAS A HUGE ROLE. IN BETWEEN. FACE TO FACE WITH ITS WE CAN HAVE A FACE TO FACE VISIT AND WE CAN NOW MULTIPLE TELEPHONE WITH IT'S IN BETWEEN THE CHECKOUT OF THE PATIENT'S PROBLEMS. UNTIL WE DECIDE NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE THE PATIENT AGAIN. OKAY SO. TAKING BASED MODEL OF CARE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US AND HAD TREMENDOUSLY HELP US IMPROVE ACCESS AND QUALITY FOR THESE PATIENTS. I CONSIDER A TREMENDOUS INJUSTICE. BUT THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND RENTALS. ARE ALL EXPERTS. SO I HOW ASK. AND I AM PLEASED TO AT THIS POINT REPRESENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE APARTMENTS WITH THE AGENTS TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TO ADOPT SB THIRTY TWO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TELL HER PROPOSAL. AND PART OF THE LEGISLATURE BUDGET PRIORITIES BECAUSE. HELPING US CONTINUE. THE TELEHEALTH THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENJOYING IT NOW PATIENTS HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON. WE WOULD LIKE YOUR SUPPORT YOU BE WE WOULD WANT YOU TO WRITE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ANDWE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED APPROPRIATELY. SO WE WILL NOT GO OUT OF BUSINESS BASICALLY YOU KNOW. BECAUSE IF NOT IF THERE ARE NO INCENTIVES IT DOES NOT NORMALLY TO BUILD THEM I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT IT IS GOING TO STOP COMPLETELY AND THAT IS THAT IS WHY IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT BABY DADDY TO SO I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT MY AND MY TIME AND I AM. READY GLANCE ANY QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR ESPECIALLY FOR MENTIONING HURON WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT AND- CITY MODEL AS AND CORRESPONDING VIA. THE HEART OF THE VALLEY I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING IT- NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO DR HORTON. HELLO THERE YOU GO HI- THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DR CLAIRE HORTON- AND I'M THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK- AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF NOT ONLY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK BUT ALSO THE TWENTY OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- ALL OF WHOM HAVE BENEFITTED GREATLY FROM. THE TELEHEALTH AND- HAVE SOME IMPORTANT FEEDBACK TODAY- ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT OUR STATE ASSOCIATION IS ALSO A PROUD SPONSOR CO SPONSOR OF- AB THIRTY TWO AS WELL. SO THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK IS THE PART OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT PROVIDES ALL THE DELIVERY SYSTEM- AS SUCH WE HAVE THE MAJOR PUBLIC HOSPITAL THE MAJOR PUBLIC NURSING HOME- IT. SAYS EIGHT SIXTEEN- PRIMARY CARE CLINICS ALSO SPECIALTY CLINICS- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND ST MADISON WI KC ESSENTIALLY ALL PUBLICLY IN SHORTER UNINSURED PATIENTS VERY VERY VULNERABLE AND DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION. AND SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE'VE BEEN SEEING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN DOING ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND TELEHEALTH VISITS A MONTH AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE ON THE PHONE. SO WE'VE DISCOVERED MANY OF THE SAME THINGS THAT- DOCTOR HIM. TO LOCK HE WAS JUST MENTIONING. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT TELEHEALTH WAS IT ACTUALLY IS A LIFE DURING- AND WE WERE. VERY CONCERNED AND ALSO A THE PRIME CARE FOR AND- LIKE MANY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIANS IN GENERAL IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PATIENTS LOSING ACCESS TO. PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE REALLY FELT THAT TELEHEALTH WAS WAS A LIFELINE SO MANY OF MY PATIENTS EVEN WHEN WE WERE OFFERING IN PERSON VISITS WERE AFRAID TO COME IN AND WE'RE TRYING TO STAY SOCIALLY DISPENSED. AND THIS WAS THE ONE WHERE WE HAD TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM. TOO AGAIN S. M. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED TO COMPACT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS- AND- WE GOT VERY CREATIVE AS WELL WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CME BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINES WHO ARE WRITING DOWN THEIR BLOOD SUGARS. WHO PHONE IN THAT INFORMATION TO US. I'VE HAD PATIENTS CALL AND- A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS AT WORK- SO THAT THEY COULD BE PART OF A JOINT VISIT- IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A REALLY EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE POWER OF THIS. TYPE OF IS IT SO IT'S NOT IDEAL FOR EVERYONE MANY OF OUR PATIENTS. LOOK FORWARD TO AND ARE NOW COMING BACK FOR IN PERSON VISITS AND FOR SOME SPECIFIC THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IT IS REALLY WORKS SO WELL FOR SOME OF OUR PATIENTS- AND IT IS. SOMETHING THAT THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO CONTINUE- IN PARTICULAR I FOUND THAT FOR MY MARGINALLY HOUSED PATIENTS- WHO MAY NOT BE RECEIVING THAT LETTER TO REMIND OF THE IN PERSON VISIT TO HAVE A PHONE- I'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM MUCH BETTER. DURING THIS TIME OF BY THE USE OF THE PHONE VISITS- WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE OR MENTAL ILLNESS- AND- THERE. HAVE A LOT OF COMPETING PRIORITIES AND CAN BUILD DISORGANIZED ABOUT MAKING IN PERSON VISITS BUT- HARD WORK CHAU RATE HAS GONE WAY UP WITH TELEHEALTH VISITS I'M IN MUCH BETTER TOUCH WITH THEM. I'VE HAD PATIENTS WITH DIABETES COME UNDER CONTROL FOR ALMOST THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I HAVE MUCH MORE REGULAR. CONTACT WITH THEM- AND THEN OF COURSE FOR ELDERLY AND HOMEBOUND PATIENTS IT'S BEEN. A REAL BLESSING AS WELL- MANY OF THEM WANT TO CAN. THIS AS- SO AT THE- SPEAKER MENTIONED- THE PHONE REALLY WORKS REALLY WELL FOR THIS REALLY HIGHLY VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATION- ESSENTIALLY ALL OF MY PATIENTS HAVE PHONES- WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY AND GET THE MONSOON- OR TO GET ON SOME KIND OF- YEAH. VIDEO PLATFORM BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING WE HAVE. WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS AND BACK TO TRY AND GET THEM ON TO OUR- OUR WEB COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AND HAVE VERY LOW UPTAKE. BECAUSE FRANKLY A LOT OF THEM. DON'T USUALLY USE EMAIL THERE'S A HUGE TECH LITERACY GAP HERE- WIFI IT CAN BE REALLY CHALLENGING IN THE HOME- AND FOR MANY OF THEM THEY LIVE IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS ARE THERE'S- MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SEVERAL FAMILIES LIVING IN ONE HOUSE AND SO. THERE'S PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH A VIDEO VISIT THAT. DOES NOT HAPPEN IF THEY CAN STOP YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE WITH THEIR PHONE OR STEP OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE. WE CAN DO THOSE PHONE VISITS ANYWHERE- SO YOU KNOW FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I'VE BEEN SO THRILLED. TO THAT WE'VE HAD- TELEHEALTH VISITS DURING THE PANDEMIC- I STRONGLY FEEL AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH. PRACTITIONERS AND SYSTEMS AS WELL. THAT IT WOULD BE A HUGE DISSERVICE TO THIS VERY VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATION. IF WE WERE TO MOVE FOR WITH ONLY ALLOWING VIDEO VISITS. I REALLY THINK THAT VIDEO VISITS YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY ONLY AVAILABLE AS A AS A- AS A- AS A MEDIUM. FOR A CERTAIN SLICE OF THE POPULATION AND FRANKLY THE- THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO REALLY IMPACT YOU KNOW HEALTH EQUITY AND IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF SERVICE- SO I REALLY- BOTH AM VERY HAPPY THAT THE STATE IS RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE. OF CONTINUING TO SUPPORT. TELEHEALTH IN GENERAL I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ADVANCE FOR THE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO WORK ON VIDEO PLATFORMS AND HELPING OUR PATIENTS GET. THEIR- BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT THE YES- AND- I'M A- THAT A- CUT OFF OF ALL FUND FOR TELL. VISIT WOULD REALLY DROPPED THE- OUT OF. WHAT WHAT IS SET UP THEM NOW. AND SO WELL I'D URGE CAN SUPPORT. FOR TELEHEALTH IN GENERAL I'M REALLY HOPING THAT CONSIDERATION CAN BE GIVEN TO CONTINUING TO. FINANCIALLY SUPPORT PHONE VISITS AS WELL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND ALSO WORKING ON OTHER ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHODS THAT CAN. HELP US GET THERE IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR HORTON NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ROBERT BARDIA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS ROBERT BEGIN I AM THE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE PATIENT NAVIGATOR AND VIRTUAL HEALTH CARE COORDINATOR FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR THE CENTRAL COAST- I WORK WITH PATIENTS ON THE DAILY- WITH.

AND PTEROPURE OVER CONSOLES- BUT WE ALSO DO NON EMERGENT- VISITS LIKE BIRTH CONTROL AND STUFF LIKE THAT FOR PATIENTS WHO DON'T CAN GO INTO THE CLINIC. THIS LAST YEAR HAS DEFINITELY SHOWED US THAT THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT I'M SORRY I CAN'T TALK. I DEFINITE NEED FOR A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GET TO THE CLINICS ESPECIALLY WITH KOBE NINETEEN HAPPENING WITH SCHOOL AND WORK AND SUCH THAT. THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO GO INTO THE CLINIC WITH A CHALLENGE TO FIND IN CLINIC VISIT AS WELL- WHEN A PATIENT BECAUSE AN APPOINTMENT THEY USUALLY TALK TO MYSELF OR ONE OF MY CALL CENTER AGENTS. AND WE CAN DETERMINE BASED ON THEIR- NEEDS THAT WAY. WHEN WE SHOULD SET THEM UP WITH- WE'RE TRYING TO DO VIDEO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME BUT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WIFI I. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A SMARTPHONE SO THEY JUST USE A PHONE CALL. AS WELL- SORRY. THANKS A LOT FOR OF OURS. FOR OUR GENDER FROM CARE SIR. ARE HELLO THIS SIR. AND IT'S BEEN CHANGING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT ONE ON. CHANCE TO TALK TO PROVIDER. WELL BEING THE COMPANY THEIR OWN HOME A LOT OF THESE. NOT BEING. WITH A CLINICAL SETTING HAVING ANXIETY. I'M GOING INTO CLINICAL STTING BECAUSE THEY FEEL JUDGED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- START HERE LIKE I SAID I HEAR BACK FROM A VACATION THAT SAY THAT THIS SERVICE HAS DEFINITELY HELPED AMOUNT- THEY APPRECIATE THE TIME SAVED ME THE TIME STABLE. SORRY I CAN'T QUOTE THE TIME SAVING ENERGY THEY HAVE ON THIS- SPECIALLY WITH A LOT OF THEM GOING BACK TO WORK AFTER NOT BEING A WORK THE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WONDER LUNCH BREAK ON BEFORE WORK OR AFTER WORK ON HAVING A GOOD THIRTY FORTY MINUTE CONCERT WITH OUR PROVIDER AND INTAKE PERSON- I THINK I WAS ABLE TO A PATIENT WHO EVEN LIVED UP NORTH FROM OUR AFFILIATE- AND- THEY HAVE THAT TROUBLE ARE. GETTING AN APPOINTMENT- BEAR. AND THEY WEREN'T AWARE THAT WE PROVIDED TELEHEALTH SERVICES UNTIL THEY CALLED ME AND THEY EVEN THOUGHT THAT THE CALL IS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ANY CLINIC VISIT. AND I TOLD THEM NO LONGER INTAKE WILL GO AHEAD AND DO YOUR- VISIT HOW THE PROVIDER DO SO MAKE YOUR OWN- MEDICATIONS TO THE PHARMACY THE ELECTRONICALLY AND- SHE WAS SO GRATEFUL BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF A- FAMILY MEMBER THAT WAS SICK. AND SHE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING HER MEANT THAT SHE NEEDED BY HAVING TELEHEALTH. DEFINITELY HELPED HER OUT AND SHE FOR THE SENSE OF RELIEF AND APPRECIATION FOR HAVING. THE SERVICE- AND NOT ALL. OF TWENTY. HOW THE WITH THE- AB. BUT THE PEACE. AND IF ANONYMOUS SITUATION WE CAN ALWAYS DO A CONSULTANT REALLY EXPENSIVE ANALYZE THE PROVIDER NEEDS IN KENYA IN CLINIC VISIT THEY WILL HAVE THEM GOING TO THE- VISIT AND ALSO AN APPOINTMENT UP FOR THEM FOR EASY TRANSFERRED OF CARE. WITHIN OUR CLINICS- AFTER THE HEARING WE'VE HAD TO WILL. SERVICES IT'S BEEN LIFE CHANGING BEEN GREAT SERVICE AND I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS CONTINUED SERVICE FOR A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS. SPECIALLY- STUDIO AND- BURKE HE WORKS. ARE WORKING IN THE- WHO DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO GOING TO AND CLINIC SAID. SO I DEFINITELY BILL THAT IT'S AN TO GET THE FUNDING WE NEED FOR OUR PATIENTS WITH THIS- SERVICE CENTER CONTATO TICKLED TO HAVE THIS. SERVICE GO ON ON. JOBS THANK YOU FOR MAKE SURE WHY THE FUNDING IS IMPORTANT FROM A PATIENT PERSPECTIVE- INCLUDING OUR PHONE SERVICES ALBERTA HEALTH CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DAVID FORD WITH CMA. RIGHT THANK YOU DR RANDALL MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AGAIN I'M DAVID FORD VICE PRESIDENT OF HEALTH IT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. IN GENERAL CMA STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE USE OF TELEHEALTH IT'S A POWERFUL TOOL THAT PATIENTS CAN USE TO CONNECT WITH THEIR CHOSEN POSITIONS. AND AS WE ALL KNOW DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS PRACTICES. THAT BEING SAID WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A VERY MIXED REACTION TO THE TELEHEALTH TRAILER. BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE HAND WE VERY. OF THE- AT LEAST SUPPORT THE PROPOSED TOOK PAN PARITY RICK. FOR VIDEO TELL MAY MANAGED CARE PLAN. WE BELIEVE THIS RESULT IN GREATLY EXPANDED OUR TO. FOR SOME PATIENTS AND MANAGE CARE. AT THE SAME LIKE THE- OTHER SPEECH BEFORE ME TOO MANY MONSTROUS. OPPOSED PROPOSAL CREATE A NEW AND LOWER FEE SCHEDULE FOR PHONE ONLY TELEHEALTH. THIS PROPOSAL IF ENACTED THREATENS TO CUT OFF A KEY TOOL THAT PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS CAN USE TO PRODUCTIVE CAN ACCESS TO CARE. IT'S BUT TO START OFF IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY WITH CNN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ACTUALLY ASKING FOR THIS POLICY. ALL OF US WORK KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME TREATMENTS NAMELY ANYONE THAT REQUIRES A PHYSICIAN TO LAY HANDS ON THE PATIENT CANNOT BE PROVIDED THROUGH TELEHEALTH. BUT WHEN A PHYSICIAN PROVIDES A TREATMENT IT SHOULD BE REIMBURSED THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE MODALITY UNDER WHICH IT HAS PROVIDED- WE OFTEN SAY THAT WE ARE YOU TALK ABOT PAYING FOR TELEPHONE WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR TELEPHONE WE ARE PAYING FOR A SERVICE THAT IS BEING PROVIDED. BY THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM OR DOWDY UNDER WHICH IT IS BEING DONE. I DO ALSO FEEL NECESSARY TO ANSWER ONE COMMENT MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT MEDI CAL RATES AND NOT F. Q. SETTINGS ARE NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN BASED ON PROVIDER COST. IF THEY WERE I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW FIRST HAND THEY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER ACROSS THE BOARD. BOTTLENECK BUT FINALLY CHARACTER IN PARTICULAR IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY PATIENTS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDICAL SPACE STILL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTIONS IT'S BUT SUPPORT VIDEO TELEHEALTH. I NGUYEN CMA SURVEYED OUR OWN MEMBERSHIP LAST OCTOBER MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF PHYSICIANS STATEWIDE REPORTED THAT THEIR TOP CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTING TELEHEALTH IS LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS FOR THE PATIENT. THOSE PATIENTS NEED TELEPHONE TO BE A VIABLE OPTION. AND FURTHERMORE WHEN LOWER INCOME PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IT'S OFTEN THROUGH THEIR SMARTPHONE. SMARTPHONE DEPENDENT PATIENTS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO HAVE A VIDEO VISIT BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE DATA CAPS LIMITED CELLPHONE MINUTES OTHER CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE ARTIFICIAL BUT COME FROM THEIR PHONE PLANS. AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS RIGHTLY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING HEALTHEQUITY THIS PROPOSAL MOVES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. IT WOULD CREATE A NEW CLASS OF THE HOUSE AND HAVE NOTS IN TELEHEALTH DEPENDING ON WHETHER A PATIENT HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET. SO AS THE OTHERS SPEAKERS DOWN I'LL ALKYLBENZENE I REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD EMBRACE FULL PAYMENT PARITY FOR ALL TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. AS A PROPOSED ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JENNIFER STOLL WITH FORTUNE. I THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD I'M JENNIFER STOLE IN THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR OCEAN AND THE CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH NETWORK. JIM LEADS THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ANALYTICS ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING OVER THIRTY FOUR UNIQUE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SERVING APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND HALF OF THOSE PATIENTS. ARE RECEIVING CARE UNDER MEDICARE I'LL CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH NETWORK IS THE LEADING CONSORTIUM OF ORGANIZATIONS INCREASING ACCESS THROUGH TELEHEALTH PLATFORMS AND PROVIDING BROADBAND THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH ITS STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL LEVEL ARE PROGRAMS MAKING AFFORDABLE. AND WE ALSO RUN THEIR CURSOR FUNDED CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH THREE CENTER RESOURCE CENTER WHICH PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE- IMPLEMENTING TELEHEALTH PLATFORMS- OCEANS SUPPORTS THE DH CS TELEHEALTH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO EXPAND COVERAGE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA UNDER MEDICO. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THE TRAILER BILL AND THE PROPOSED BUDGET DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES THE DECISION NOT TO COVER COULD NOT OFFER COVERAGE INPAYMENT PARITY FOR AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH SERVICES FOR FQHCS IN ART SHE'S. WILL DRIVE STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES WHICH IS WHAT MR FOR JUSTREFERRED TO YOU AND EXASPERATED HEALTH AND DISPARITIES. FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HARD. IN SECURITY AND TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS AND SINCE WE'RE A DATA ORGANIZATION I WANTED TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AGGREGATED DATA WE'RE SEEING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO DURING 202037% OF ALL THE ENCOUNTERS AT IN THE OCEAN NETWORK WHICH WAS OVER THREE MILLION PATIENT ENCOUNTERS WERE CONDUCTED USING TELEHEALTH. 46% OF THOSE ENCOUNTERS IN TELEHEALTH WERE DELIVERED IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH THREE OUT OF FOUR OF THOSE. OF THOSE TELEHEALTH ENCOUNTERS WERE CONDUCTED IN SPANISH. PATIENTS WHO STATED THAT THEY NEEDED HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT WERE FOURTEEN AND 17% MORE LIKELY TO USE TELEHEALTH RESPECTIVELY. SO WE WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT TELEHEALTH ACT BOOK CLOSES pBE IN PERSON HERE DELIVERS. EVEN MORE INSTRUCTIVE TO THE ANALYSIS OF DATA RELATED TO AUDIO ONLY USE LAST YEAR ABOUT JIM MEMBERS USED ONLY AUDIO ONLY SERVICE IS. 51% OF AUDIO ONLY ENCOUNTERS WORKING THAT WERE IN THE LATIN NEXEN HISPANIC POPULATION AND AGAIN POPULATIONS THAT HAVE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS RECEIVED GREATER CARE AN AUDIO ONLY SERVICES HELPED ACCESS THAT. I'M STILL LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THE- THIS COMMITTEE TO. STRONG LOOK AT THIRTY TWO- INSTEAD OF ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY TESTIMONY AND MOVING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD AND I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP- YOU TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSED ALL WITHOUT A WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WOULD FOLLOWED BY A- NUMBER OF. ACTUALLY MY LIFE MORE COOPER COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS SO- SO I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN YOU KNOW MIGHT THAT MIGHT MY THINKING ON THE ISSUE A MEDIC CAL. A TELEHEALTH COVERAGEAND PAYMENT PARITY. ONE OF THE THINGS MANY THINGS THAT CHANGE DURING THE PANDEMIC IS HOW HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED IN GENERAL- HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE NOW PROVIDING CARES IN WAY IN NEW WAYS THAT WE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO- PRE COATED. WE'RE NOT USING VIDEO AND PHONE CALLS IN A WAY WE SIMPLY WEREN'T DOING THAT- ONE OF THE WAY ONE OF THE AREAS WE'VE SEEN. WHERE WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT IN HOW CARE IS DELIVERED AS IN FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT PATIENTS HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO THIS. AND IT CAN BE- IN MANY CASES THEY ACTUALLY PREFERRED IT'S MORE CONVENIENT. IT CAN ENSURE PATIENT PRIVACY ELIMINATES TRANSPORTATION TIME AND THE NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK. THEY BRING SERVICES TO WHERE THE PATIENT IS. WE'RE BUILDING OFF OF A MEDICARE RATE STRUCTURE THAT IN MANY CASES BELOW COMMERCIAL PAYERS- PAY FOR THE SAME SERVICES. SO I THINK A PARITY REQUIREMENT MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THESE- SERVICES IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY. I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO BE NOT MOVING TOWARDS PAYMENT REFORM FOR FQHCS I KNOW ANY TRANSITION IS HARD. BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BANDAGES TO AN ALTERNATIVE PATH PAYMENT METHOD METHODOLOGY- AND NOT JUST FOR TELEPHONE VISITS- PAYMENT REFORM IS NOT JUST ABOUT COVERAGE FOR TELEPHONE CALLS. IT WILL ENABLE AN ABLE ADVOCATE SEES TO- BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO SAME DAY MENTAL HEALTH IS IT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR YEARS- USE NON BILLABLE OF PROVIDERS. AND PROVIDE SERVICES OUTSIDE THE FOUR WALLS OF THE HEALTH CENTER. THE AMENDMENTS TO- TO AB THIRTY TWO AND I WHAT I WANT TO SAY WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH- STAKEHOLDERS AND- AND- THE AUTHOR- MOVED ACCURACIES IN THAT DIRECTION. WHILE PROVIDING CONTINUE COVERAGE FOR TELEPHONE BUSINESS AND TELL ACCURACIES CAN TAKE THE NEXT STEP. AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER MYSELF WHO DELIVERED A SERVICES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PERSON IT'S TAKEN ME TIME TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT'S THE NEW NORMAL- WE PUT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO AB THIRTY TWO. I THINK THE WORK I PUT INTO THE BILL BY THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS REPRESENTS A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. THAT PROTECTS PATIENT ACCESS AND TAKES A BIG STEP TOWARDS AN ALTERNATE PAID PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. WRECKAGE IF CHRISSY'S THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MYSELF HAVE HEARD FROM- HEALTH CENTERS ON. A FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS AS WELL- AND IT- OBVIOUSLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DH. CS NOT EXTENDING TELEHEALTH. FLEXIBILITIES IF THE PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IS THAT. WE CAN KEEP DOING BUSINESS LIKE WE HAVE DONE BEFORE WE'VE SEEN THE INEQUITIES. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF. GOING TO YOUR COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE STARK BETWEEN L. A. COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT- AND ACROSS THE STATE. AND YOU KNOW I COULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE IN L. A. COUNTY BUT MY JOB IS TO REPRESENT MY DISTRICT FIRST BUT TO ALSO REPRESENT ALL. OF CALIFORNIA AND- WE ALL KNOW THAT BUSINESSES USUAL THE NOT WORK THE PAST- WE HAVE TO START GET OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO EXTEND FLEXIBILITY AS WE HAVE TO BE. CONFIDENT THAT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN. THE WAY THAT WE OFFER SERVICES AND I LIKE FELT THAT SOMEBODY SAID IT'S NOT A TELEPHONE CALL IT'S PROVIDING SERVICES. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A TELEPHONE CALL WILL CALL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES. TO THOSE FOLKS THAT CANNOT- HAD BEEN DO NOT TRYING TO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A SMARTPHONE OR TO. TO THE BROADBAND AND IN TERMS OF BROADBAND I'M A CO SPONSOR OF A CO AUTHOR OF. AB THIRTY TWO BECAUSE I TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE EQUITY. OF UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT IS ONE WAY OF DOING IT THE OTHER WAY OF DOING IT IS OVER THE PHONE SOME OF OUR FOLKS CANNOT AFFORD THE SMARTPHONES OR- EVEN IF WE HAVE BROADBAND. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS THAT I HAVE MY DAD IS EIGHTY MY MOM IS. AT SEVENTY FIVE AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ACCESS- YOU KNOW- THE BUDDHISM. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW SO WE CAN EXPECT THAT- YOU KNOW A GENERATION THAT HAS NOT. TRADITIONALLY YOU USED THE COMPUTER TO ALL OF ALL OF A SUDDEN TO BE USING THE COMPUTER I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY. OF A LOT OF- LATINOS ARE SPANISH SPEAKERS ASIAN- SPEAKERS AND- AND QUITE FRANKLY OLDER. AMERICANS THAT. ARE NOT JUST GOING TO TRANSITION FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT THEY DO KNOW HOW TO USE THE PHONE. AND IF WE CAN GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THE PHONE THAT WE HAVE TO BE- FLEXIBLE IN WHAT WE DO AND MAKE SURE THAT WE OFFER EVERYTHING POSSIBLE BUT- MAKE THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HOLE. FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING SO I REALLY STRONGLY URGE THAT WE CONTINUE. TO OR AT LEAST GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO THOSE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE SERVICES OVER THE PHONE SOLD THANK YOU- MISTER. MISTER JACK. AND NEXT WE WILL HEAR US. RUNS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ECHOING- MANY OF THIS. SOMETHING HAVE BEEN SET. OVER IT'S GREAT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND TELL HEALTH CARE BUT- WE'RE GONNA MAKE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ADDRESSING ALL ON THE NEEDS OF THOSE THAT ARE- SEEKING. MEDICAL CARE. AND WE KNOW THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS HAS BEEN SPOTTY TO SAY THE LEAST. AND MANY- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INCLUDING- INDIAN RESERVATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SO WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT MOVING IN THE DISCUSSION OF THOSE GOING INTO STRONGER. TELE HEALTH NET WERE INTERNET IS NEEDED. WE HAVE TO- ALSO. TALK ABOUT. THE PRICE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THOSE STILL USING- THE PHONES THE AUDIO PHONES OF TELEPHONES THOSE THINGS THAT STILL. ARE PART OF AN AND INFRASTRUCTURAL. NEEDS IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THAT- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BRING UP THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN COMMENTS. ARE WE TRULY LOOKING AT THAT AS WE'RE TRYING TO INVOLVE THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE WE LOOKING AT EVOLVING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. THOSE THAT THAT. HAVE INTERNET. BUT THOSE THAT DON'T AND THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS ARE THE HIGH AREAS THAT WE'VE SEEN. WITH UNDERLYING CONDITIONS THAT ONE PANDEMICS DO COM WE SEEN THEM SOME COME. TO THE PANDEMICS AT HIGHER RATES SO AND WE DO KNOW. THAT ALSO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IS THE FIRST STEP. SO ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT. HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. ON ON A PHONE OR OR CONVERSE WITH THEM. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH OR ELSE THEY WOULD END UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. BACKING UP THE BEDROOM LAYS IN THOSE TYPE OF THINGS SO PRETTY. OP MET A MATTER. IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE THERE AND SO SPEAKING UP. ON THE THAT SIDE OF AUDIO- TELEPHONES NON SMARTPHONES NOT EVERYBODY IS A QUIPPED STILL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S AREAS. THAT STILL DON'T HAVE TELEPHONE LINES RUNNING TO THEM SO WE'RE NOT AS FAR YOU BOB AS WE THINK AND THE MORE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD AND FAILED TO ADDRESS THOSE AREAS. BECOMES EVEN MORE GREATER CONCERN. BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AS FAR AS THE- MINIMIZING OF REIMBURSEMENTS DO WE HAVE ANY STATISTICS DO WE HAVE ANY DATA. THAT SHOWS THAT WE LOWER THOSE REIMBURSEMENT COST WHAT WILL THAT EFFECT BE ON THE PROVIDING OF THE HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE- UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO GET THOSE SERVICES THERE. WELL NOW WE LOWER THOSE THOSE REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENTS WILL THERE BE EVEN HARDER FOR THOSE TO GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE JUST ADDRESSED. MISS COOPER I BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED TO YOU. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS TRACKING FOR THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE PROPOSAL- THE DEPARTMENT- GREATLY EXPANDED- OUR TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES AND PROVISIONS ARE WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL FROM WHAT WE HAVE PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FAR BEYOND WHAT. WE WERE DOING EVEN BEYOND WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND I JUST THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS. THIS IS FOLLOWING THOSE NUANCES AND THAT INCLUDES THAT PROVISION FOR US TO EXTEND IT AND ALLOW FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED- FOR NON ACTUATES THE OUR PROVIDERS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT I'LL GET TO THAT POINT A SECOND- JUST ADDED. PAYMENT UP THE SCHEDULE SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME COMMENTS AT CLEARING HOUSE THAT BUT SOME COMMENTS DID NOT AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO ENSURE- WE ALSO. NOT JUST THE IDEA ONLY GREATLY EXPANDED OUR OUR FOOTPRINT IN THIS BASIC KNOWLEDGE BEING THE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYED IN WHAT WE DO THINK WILL IMPROVE. QUALITY AND ACCESS TO CARE AND SERVICES. I'M IN THE LONG RUN SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO YOU WE HIGHLIGHT MAKE SURE- IS A SAID AGAIN. IN REGARDS TO THE FQHCS AN AUDIO ONLY SERVICES WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE IN WHICH THE PROPOSAL WHERE WE HAVE. RESTRICTED ACCESS TO- THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WERE AFFORDED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE. WITH FQHCS IN REGARDS TO NOT ONLY THE BUILDING OF THE LARGER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY- I'D MENTIONED. AS WE HAVE ALREADY BEGAN THAT KICK OFF WE ARE HAVING EXTENSIVE IN GREAT CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FQHCS TO ENGAGE IN THAT EIGHT PM. R. WHICH WE THINK IS CRITICAL I TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN REGARDS TO HOW. THEY PROVIDE CARE IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE ROLE THAT THEY CAN HAVE A MEDIC CAL TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND ACCESS TO CARE- WHICH HAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING THE USE OF AUDIO ONLY AND OTHER- TELEHEALTH OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN SEE M. S. CURRENTLY DOESN'T ALLOW. A FEW WEEKS THESE TO PROVIDE. I THINK THE GIVEN THE CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR FQHCS WE FIND OURSELVES IN SOMEWHAT OF A BIND- IN REGARDS TO MAKING IT EQUAL TO THE NON ACCURACY PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THE DEPARTMENT- HOWEVER. AGAIN IF. YOU KNOW. THE ACCURACY CLINICS ARE WILLING TO- TO WAVE AT TGS. OF FOR THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE AUDIO ONLY SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT IS WILLING AND ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AND THEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF RATE FOR THOSE AUDIO. ONLY SERVICES I'M TO BE EQUAL TO WHAT WE WOULD BE PROPOSING- YOU KNOW IT'S SIMILAR RATE FOR. AND THEN I FQHCS. ARE JUST WANTED HIGHLIGHT CALM AND HELP THAT IS HELP TO ADDRESS THE COMMON MADE. THANK YOU I'M GOING TO STAY WITH YOU COOPER I CAN I FIRST WANNA- UPLIFT AND ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL LIFELINE DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND- ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US HAS THE- POTENTIAL TO DRIVE STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM. AND I'M GROUNDING MYSELF AND SURE ON WHICH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY. AND REMINDING MYSELF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM. IN A POOR CITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH INTERNET OR SMARTPHONES AND- THE STRUGGLE THAT THAT COMMUNITY WILL HAVE WITH THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL. THAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU IF I CAN. THAT IT SEEMED AS IF YOUR COMMENT WAS THAT WE NEEDED A LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR AUDIO VERSUS VIDEO AND IN PERSON. AND YOUR CURRENT STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO. PENALIZE THOSE WHO ARE ON THE TELEPHONE. RATHER THAN TO INCENTIVIZE. THOSE WHO ARE DOING IN PERSON OR VIDEO. AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. FROM WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T BE IT ADDS. UP YOU KNOW I THINK THEM FOR AUDIO ONLY- BY ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE EARLIER BY A FEMALE IN REGARDS TO BETTER CALIBRATE. BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IN HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES IS REFLECTIVE OF COSTS WHICH IS WHY WE PAY MORE FOR A HOSPITAL BED THAT THAT WE DO FOR AN OUTPATIENT VISIT. AND WE STRONGLY FELT THAT REIMBURSEMENT SHOULD REFLECT THE OVERALL TYPE OF SERVICE AND COST OF THE SERVICE BEING PROVIDED WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ALIGNING OUR PROPOSAL- TO SERVICES IN THAT WAY- AND THAT IS THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW CURRENT PROPOSAL- AND WE UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS WHICH IS WHY WE INCLUDED IT IN THE PROPOSAL AND IT'S ALSO WHY WE'RE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH A FEW ISSUES IN REGARDS TO. WHAT WE CAN GET THAT MOVING FORWARD- WITH THE RATE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO IT NOW MIND YOU WE LACK SOME OF THE- I'M CONCERNED CMS HAS IN REGARDS TO THAT BECAUSE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS FULLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A BROAD ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING AUDIO ONLY IN THE FUTURE WHEN APPROPRIATE. BUT I WOULD ALSO RAISE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US AROUND EQUITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE. MAKING SURE THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO IN PERSON CARE AND FOR QUALITY CARE OF AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BALANCE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE WITH ALL OF THIS AND I THINK. EARLIER DAVID SAID IT WELL IT'S ABOUT THAT FORMULA WHEN IN PERSON VERSUS AUDIO ONLY IS AVAILABLE OF COURSE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SOME PLACES ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO AUDIO ONLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TELEHEALTH EQUIPMENT AND OFFICES WERE CLOSED AND THAT WAS APPROPRIATE DURING. A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF THE NATURE THAT WE JUST CROSSED BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND LOOK AT WHAT OUR POLICY SHOULD BE IN NEEDS TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE THINGS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS DO YOU HAVE ACCESS. TO REALLY YOUR HIGH QUALITY PREVENTATIVE SERVICES WHICH DOES INCLUDE BOTH IN PERSON AND TELEHEALTH. SERVICES INCLUDING AUDIO ONLY SO I THINK THE WHERE THE TO. IS TO FIND THAT I TAKE A THE COM TODAY. YOU KNOW WE ARE AT IT FROM MANY ANGLES AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL IN REGARDS TO WHERE WE ARE ON. ON THE RATE THAT WE'RE PUTTING. AND I HOPE YOU'RE HEARING FROM MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE THE WORK TRYING TO ALSO FIND THAT BALANCE. AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE. A DECREASE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE SERVICES- WITH. WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT AND JUST REALLY HOPE WE CAN FIND A BALANCE THAT MAKE SURE WERE- HAVING. A LENDS TOWARDS EQUITY HAS WELL AND I JUST. I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE A COMMENT YOU JUST STATED THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT BALANCE I DON'T SEE HOW- A. I. TELEPHONIC- VISIT UP TAKES AWAY FROM IN PERSON THERE THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT COMMENT- AND NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- I'M A FORMER TEACHER AND WE ALSO WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE PROVIDING. SERVICES JUST BECAUSE WE WERE PROVIDING ZOOM AS EDUCATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE TEACHERS WERE PAID IN THE LAST TEN IN THIS CASE JUST BECAUSE WITH THE DOCTORS WERE PROVIDING SERVICES OVER THE PHONE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE DOCTORS WERE ANY LESS QUALIFIED. OVER THE PHONE THAN THEY ARE IN PERSON SO I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THOSE COMMENTS- YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE- YOU KNOW. CELEBRATING BECAUSE THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT AFTER THIS PANDEMIC WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SHORT A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING SO AGAIN I DON'T UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO COMMENTS AND- FIRST HOW IS IT THAT. BY PROVIDING- OF PHONE- SERVICES DECREASES THAT SERVICES FOR THOSE IN PERSON SERVICES- AND SO I MEAN AGAIN YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR EQUITY AND IF THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S VALID- ESPECIALLY WHEN. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN AGAIN FOR THE PROVIDERS DOING. TELEPHONE PROVIDING SERVICES BY TELEPHONE DOESN'T DIMINISH DIMINISH IN THE M. THE SERVICE IN MY OPINION IT DIDN'T DIMINISH IT- FOR TEACHERS AND YES WE ALL HAD PROBLEMS- YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. BUT THE TEACHERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAID LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING ZOOM- EDUCATION AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SHOULD BE LAST JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING OVER THE PHONE SO IF YOU CAN. HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT COMMENT ABOUT HOW. ONE BIG ONE DECREASES THE OTHER. CHART BE TO. SO I THINK WHAT I MENTIONING IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN VISITS ADMISSION BY MANY OF THE SPEAKERS PREVIOUS TO ME- AT THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN PERSON. RESIDENTS ARE YOU ONLY AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS THERE IS. A PERFECT ROLE FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES I THINK PART OF THE CARE BEING PROVIDED TO SOMEBODY. OF THAT THERE ARE VISITS THAT DO NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN PERSON- ADDRESS MENTIONED BY BY MANY SPEAKERS AND MOST PHYSICIANS IN REGARDS TO WHEN THEY'RE PRESENTING THIS PIECE AND SO. THAT'S WHAT MY COMMENT WAS IN REGARDS I CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES. DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MAJORITY OF- VISITS WERE BEING PROVIDED VIA EITHER TELEHEALTH IN ORDER AUDIO ONLY VISIT. HOWEVER WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN RECEIVING IMMUNIZATIONS- DURING THE LAST YEAR WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DIP DECREASE. IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN- WHO WERE GETTING THEIR WELL CHILD VISITS WHICH REQUIRE CERTAIN PIECES. OF THOSE VISITS THE IN PERSON SO MY COMMENTS WERE REALLY MORE AROUND THE FORMULA AND I FEED BY THAT I MEAN A COMBINATION OF. IN PERSON VISITS AND AUDIO ONLY BEING AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS AS THERE'S A CLEAR NEED. TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THEIR PROVIDER IN PERSON. AND TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE TYPES OF CARE THAT CAN'T BE PROVIDED VIA AUDIO ONLY. VERY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT IT IS ALSO COMPLEMENTARY FOM AN ACCESS POINT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE IMPROV. AND HAVE GOOD QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR CERTAIN SCREENINGS AND SERVICES THAT MEET THE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN PERSON SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT MY COMMENT WAS REGARDING. JUST MAKING SURE IT'S A PART OF THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BUT NOT BE ON THE MODALITIES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. AFFECTED BY CONFLICT. WHAT ABOUT RIGHT BUT BUT I THINK THE COMMENTS- IF I. MADE THE COMMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IS NOT SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE ONLY TELEPHONIC- VISITS I THINK. THIS IS WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE. A VARIETY OF WAYS TO BE MAKE SURE THAT. SOME FOLKS ACCESS AND OF COURSE I AND- THAT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE. OVER THE PHONE. AND SO I DON'T. UNDERSTAND THAT COMMENT EITHER- AND I DON'T THINK THAT- A PROVIDER OVER THE PHONE IS GOING TO. FADE TO OUR PATIENTS- DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS AND LET'S JUST DO THIS OVER THE PHONE. SO I DID SO JUST SO THAT WE DON'T GET INTO KIND OF THAT. BACK AND FORTH- THIS IS NOT ABOUT A GUY BIG BUT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WERE EQUITABLE IN THE SERVICE PROVIDED IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES ONLY HAVE. ACCESS TO WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GO THEY CAN GO BUT A LOT OF TIMES ARE NOT ABLE TO GOAL THE WORK LONG HOURS. AND IF THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AT LEAST- BEGIN TO OFFER SOME KIND OF HEALTH. SOME SOME KIND OF- SERVICES AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. IT'S NOT ONE VERSUS THE OTHER AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT A BALANCE. BUT AGAIN THE PROVIDERS ARE NOT. ANY LESS THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ANY LESS- CARE. IF THEY'RE DOING IT OVER THE PHONE AND SO FOR ME THE EQUITY IS- FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO FOR THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE. ARE ARE DOING THIS AND SO. I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS IT WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT- OF ONE VERSUS THE OTHER. AND I THAT'S WHAT I HEARD I KNOW IF I. HEARD THAT INCORRECTLY- THEN THEN. I THEN I YEAH I WOULD MAKE SURE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MY COMMENTS- BUT I WITH I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT ONE VERSUS THE OTHER AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING OR AT LEAST WHAT I'M SAYING AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING IS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING AVAILABLE SO THAT FOLKS THAT NOW HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY CAN ACCESS HEALTH CARE- ARE STILL ABLE TO DO IT NOT JUST IN L. A. COUNTY MY COMMUNITY BY THE UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND M ARAMBULA COMMUNITY DOCTOR WITH COULD DOCTOR REGULAR DOCTOR WORDS COMMUNITIES AND OF MR BOMBS OF COMMUNITIES ARE ARE YOU KNOW ONES THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST NEED AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE SOME KIND OF SERVICES FOR THEM THEN LET'S DO IT I THINK THAT WERE IN A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD WE CAN'T KEEP GOING BACK TO THE THINGS THAT WE USED TO DO ALL BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN AGAIN IF THE PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IS THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL OPTIONS NOT TAKE AWAY WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE JUST BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC IS GOING TO BE OVER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THE ENTIRE PANEL ON ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL SIX. ON THE OFFICE OF MEDICARE INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION.

ADULT RESPECTFULLY AND OF COURSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE- DEPARTMENT TO MAINTAIN SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE DEPLOY AND USE RESOURCES OVER TIME. AND HOW WE INTEGRATE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. ALL THE- QUESTION FOR OPPOSED TO BOTH LESSONS LEARN FROM CAL. ALL A FUNDAMENTALLY BAKER ONE OF COURSE WAS THAT IT WAS VERY HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF ALIGNING ALL INTEGRATING SERVICES BY ALIGNING WITH MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL PAYMENT STRUCTURES AND THIS REPRESENTS LOTS OF SORT OF PARTICULAR SCALE THE YOUNG LADY CAL MEDICAMENT. COUNTIES WHEN THEY WENT CALVET CONNECT AND ALL THE OFFICE WILL WORK ACROSS MULTIPLE TEAMS IN THE CS AND WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE TO ALSO. BE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WOULD BE STEP UP.

WITHOUT I WILL THANK THE PANEL MOVING TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WITH THE SAME PANEL ON THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES MEDICAL BILLING OPTION ALSO KNOWN AS ELLIE T. A. B. O. P. PROGRAM EXPANSION AGAIN OUR SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL OR WILL LIGHT BORN AND CASEY COOPER. CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN. ASSEMBLY THANK YOU. SO HERE THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING EIGHT PERMANENT POSITIONS AND TO LIMITED TERM CONTRACTS WITH EXPENDITURE THIRTY OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FORWARD THE RESOURCES BOTH SUPPORT THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES MEDICARE BILLING OPTION PROGRAM OR WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS A LIAISON. SPECIFICALLY THE POSITIONS AND CONTRACT FUNDING WILL HELP SUPPORT A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES INCLUDING AN EXTENSIVE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO NON PARTICIPATING ELEAZAR WE DO SEE SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN IN REGARDS TO PROVIDING THESE SERVICES IN SCHOOLS AND SO WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALIENS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING TO JOIN THE PROGRAM AND SO RESOURCES WOULD BE FOCUSED ON THAT ALSO WE WOULD HAVE THE VENDOR HELP US DEVELOP A TRANSITION PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM OUR REGION TRAINING ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE OF THE. STAFF WOULD BE ENGAGING IN AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY AS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TEMPLE ONE OF THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR FOR THE L. A. BACH PROGRAM. OF THE STAFF WOULD BE HELPING TO- CLEAR FINE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LEDS IN REGARDS TO FIX BENEFIT BENEFITS FOR THAT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL STUDENTS WITH THE CARE PLAN. AS WELL AS THE ALLOWABLE PROVIDER TYPES AND SO PROVIDING THAT TECHNICAL. ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL. I'M SO WE DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO ADDRESS UP FOR YOU ALL ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAD TO DO WITH SIGNET- WHETHER IT'S SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. OF THE DEPARTMENT DOES BELIEVE THAT OUR REQUEST IS SUFFICIENT IN ORDER TO HELP MEET THE NEEDS OF ELEAZAR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. AND I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD SERVE ALL OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS TO KIND OF HAVE THAT GROWTH OVER TIME TO BRING ON NEW ELLIE EIGHT. AND INDIVIDUALS INTO THE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE- IN REGARDS TO YOU ARE YOU KEYS. ARE AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN- AS AND THE IDPS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SO. I EAT. I EAT PEAS SORRY- OUR SEGMENTS WHICH ARE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF YOU DIDN'T ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES UNDER FEDERAL. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT OR THE IDEA. THAT INDIVIDUAL CARE PLANS ARE BROADER IN NATURE AND ARE USED BY THE LTA AS A MEDICAL MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY. DIRECT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO A STUDENT IN A SCHOOL SETTING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STUDENT QUALIFIES. FOR SERVICES UNDER THE IDEA- STUDENTS I DO NOT NEED TO RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN. THIS CHANGE HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE L. A. BOX WITH HIS EX. IT IS GREATLY EXPANDED FROM WHAT WAS AVAILABLE BEFORE. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO- BILL FOR THOSE. BOB SERVICES AGAIN YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT WITH IN THE- INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS TO JUST NOTATING THAT. PART IS IT'S STILL A REQUIREMENT THERE. AND THEN WE THEIR V. INDIVIDUAL HOW OF THE PLAN A MATTER MANAGED TOOL FOR. THOSE MEDICALLY. SERVICES AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN THE SCHOOL SETTING UP AND THAT PLAN MUST BE DEVELOPED BY A REGISTERED CREDENTIALED SCHOOL NURSE OR A QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN. IF APPROPRIATE- THE STUDENTS AS WELL. IT'S NOT BE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO YEARS I'M ATTENDING A PUBLIC SCHOOL REQUIRE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF THE HEALTH SERVICES BEING OFFERED. AND HAVE AN INDIVIDUALIZED OF PLANTS RECEIVED THE L. A. BACH SERVICES SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS CLARIFY AT THE NEW REQUIREMENT THAT WAS APPROVED IN THE STATE PLAN. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT IT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. SINAN I'D LIKE TO- DAY AND A LITTLE BIT I- AND- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THIS PROGRAM IS ON. NOT FUNCTIONED VERY WELL FOR A FEW YEARS- THEREBY LEAVING A LOT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS AND LIMITING OUR ABILITY FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO HELP PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND I'M TOLD THAT THE PROGRAM HAS EXPERIENCED UP 275% OF FEDERAL DISALLOWANCE IS- FOR CLAIMS AND MANY ELEAZER CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM DUE TO ITS COMPLEXITY. GIVEN THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL INTENDED AND ENVISIONED TO BE MEANINGFUL REFORM SUFFICIENT FOR THIS PROGRAM TO REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I WOULD SAY THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HISTORICAL CLAWBACKS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RULES THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT WAS APPROVED RECENTLY BY CMS IN TWENTY TWENTY- WAS SUBMITTED A VERY LONG TIME AGO AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR US TO NEGOTIATE WITH CMS AND GET THAT APPROVAL. I'M WHICH HAS RESULTED IN SOME CHALLENGES AS WELL AS HISTORICAL COMPLAINTS IN THIS PROGRAM HOWEVER THE CURRENT TEAM WHO IS LEADING THE L. A. BACH PROGRAM HAS BEEN DOING NO MEN'S WORK I TO ENGAGE WITH A LIAISON TO- TO DO EXTENSIVE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION THEY'RE CREATING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TOOLS. I'M IN REALLY ALL OF THAT IS TO AID IN REGARDS TO GETTING MORE INFORMATION OUT THERE AROUND ON HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE SERVICES IN SCHOOLS HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE ELEAZAR UNDERSTANDING THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND RULES AND SIMPLIFYING WHERE WE POSSIBLY CAN. I WERE EVEN GIVING IT A DEEP DIVE IN REGARDS TO YOU- WHEELS THAT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE FEDERAL RULES WORKING FINE BUT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN HISTORICAL STATE RULES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE IS THAT WE ARE DOING THOSE EVALUATIONS AS WELL. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED YOU ARE MAXIMIZING OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES IN SCHOOLS- AND PROVIDING THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ELEAZAR INCLUDING GETTING NEW ALLEY IF YOU HAVEN'T HISTORICALLY PARTICIPATED TO PARTICIPATE. THAT'S ALSO WHY YOU HAVE THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS FOR FOOTBALL ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR CONSIDERATION TO- HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROVIDING SERVICES INSTALLED IN DRYING DOWN THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS I. TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SIR. I'M I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED HEAR YOU DOING OUTREACH THE NONPARTISAN. L. A. AND WOULD. INTO YOU TO DO AS MUCH TRAINING AND GUIDANCE AS WE CAN TO ARE ONLY AS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE- DOING ALL WE CAN TO PUBLISH FEDERAL DOLLARS TO- WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL SEVEN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL EIGHT ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.

ON SEVEN POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION IN A CONVENIENT CENTER PROGRAMS. EITHER METHODOLOGY FOR IMPLEMENTING THAT THE H. Q. I. P. ON THE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS CHIU AP WILL ASSIST COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS AND COUNTY JEFF MEDICARE PLANS PREPARE FOR. OF THE VAST OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN CALLING. THE DOLLARS ARE SPECIFIC TO INCENTIVIZING PAYMENTS IN SYSTEMS FOR BOTH. DECIDE TO HAVE THE COUNTIES BE READY. IT WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CONVERTING THE COUNTY LEVEL BUILDING ON TO A AT WHAT'S CALLED THE HECTIC LEVEL ONE CODE. ON AS WELL AS UPDATING COUNTY IT SYSTEMS FOR THE CHANGES BEING PROPOSED IN THE MEDICALLY NECESSITY DETERMINATION AND STANDARDIZED FORMS THAT ARE WITHIN CALLING. IT WOULD INCORPORATE MANAGED CARE AND OTHER UTILIZATION DATA FROM DH CS. TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE COUNTIES AND SYSTEMS OF CARE. FOR EXAMPLE A TO KNOW WITH A PRESCRIPTION HAS BEEN FILLED BY A BENEFICIARY AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION GO BACK. INTO THEIR SYSTEM. DATA INTERFACE TO IN THE THAT CARE THE BEING PROVIDED. AND THE LAST THING DEFINITELY LEAST A MANY OF THIS THE- ARE CHANGES WOULD BE ALSO FOR TO EVENTUALLY CALL BETTER- DATA OUR TOWN PARTNER.

DECREASING WASTE IMPROVING OUR REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE PAYMENT REFORM THAT'S PROPOSING CALLING AND HELPING PROVIDERS USE MORE OF THEIR TYPE OF-PATIENT CARE ALL OF WHICH IMPROVE ON THE COUNTIES ARE PART OF MIND IN IMPROVEMENTS STUFF. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WHEN IT IS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A SHELL COMPANY. WITH C. B. H. T. F. C. SHE MAY BE HAVING. DIFFICULTIES HAS NOT LOGGED ON AT THIS MOMENT. DR ARAMBULA I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE ON THE SHOW CAPITA CAP SHE WAS UNFORTUNATELY UNAVOIDABLY PULLED AWAY AND I'M GONNA BE STEPPING IN TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE IN THE AGENDA. YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR CBH DA- I'M HOPING THAT THAT'S OKAY FOR ME TO CONTINUE. I PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M ACTUALLY CASEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF EXPLAINING EXACTLY THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE BEEN UNDERGOING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS FROM THE U. H. QUIPPED- IT'S ESSENTIAL FUNDING FOR ALL TO SUPPORT THE EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM CHANGES THE CHARACTER HERE ARE HEALTH PLANS ARE GOING TO BE UNDERTAKING FOR. REFORM THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CHANGES ANOTHER CALLIE PROPOSAL'S INCENTIVE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF MILESTONES THAT COUNTIESARE EXPECTED. TO ACHIEVE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS WE SUPPORT YOU THINK. EACH QUICK. FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT WILL. ALLEN CHANGES SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF EACH CHANGES GOING TO REQUIRE EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR COUNTY. FIGHTERS AS WELL AS CHANGES THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND OTHER OPERATIONS HAS MANAGED CARE. LANCE COUNTY OR WELL POSITIONED TO DETERMINE WHERE FUNDS ARE MOST NEEDED LOCALLY DIRECTLY THE QUESTION TO WITH- WITH MUCH-OF THE THEFT. BUT STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT FOR US TO REALLY BE ABLE TO RESPOND ABOUT WHETHER THE FUNDS ALLOCATED INSTANTIATE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE ADEQUATE ARE YOU CONSIDERING THE MAGNITUDE THE CHANGES NEEDED C. B. H. T. F. DEFINITELY DOES SUPPORT THE MULTI YEAR- INCENTIVE FRAMEWORK OUTLINED BY THE ACS AND SO FAR THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE HAD. THE FREE MARKET'S GONNA PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES FOR COUNTIES TO BEGIN. TO MEET THE MILESTONES AND THEN AT THOSE POINTS EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY OF BOTH THE T. AFTERWARDS AND THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR THE PURPOSE SO- AGAIN WE THANK I'M HERE YES. FOR THE PARTNERSHIP ON THIS EFFORT. HI THANK YOU WITHOUT I WILL BRING BACK UP TO THE DIE TO SEE IF WE ARE ANY NUMBER QUESTIONS. SCENE NONDA I WILL THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. ON TO DH CS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND INCREASED ACCESS TO STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE WILL HAVE FOUR SPEAKERS ON THIS% PANEL WILL LIGHT BORN TRACY COOPER TOBY EWING AND- ELIADE GUY YARD. SO CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU OF ALL START WITH THE COMMENTS BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT- SO APPLE'S FIRST WILL KIND OF GO OVER SOME OF OUR REQUEST ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUING INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE OVERARCHING I'M REQUEST ON THE STUDENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES IN REGARDS TO OUR P. C. P. REQUEST AND THEN I WILL- ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THERE IS A HANDFUL OF THEM ARE AT. FOR THE FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE THE DH CS IS REQUESTING- TWO POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWO POINT ONE FIVE FIVE GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO SUPPORT EQUIPMENT UP FOR POSITIONS IN CONTRACT RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM THE FUNDING WOULD BE SHIFTED FROM THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION NE TIME GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL SYSTEMS PROPOSED THAT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE RESOURCES WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE COMMUNICATIONS THE FEEDBACK MECHANISMS BETWEEN ACCOUNTING AND TRAVEL PARTNERS IN REGARDS TO THE AVAILABLE FUNDS- INCLUDING INFORMATION NOTICES WEAPON ARE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED ADDITIONALLY THE RESOURCES WITH MONSTER THAT WOULD MONITOR THE VARIOUS GRANTS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE EHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUUM WE ARE ANTICIPATING A LARGE NUMBER OF GRANTEES AMEND THE RESOURCES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MANAGE ALL OF THOSE GRANTEES- ITEMS. THAT ALSO WOULD INCLUDE GRANT YOU PROGRESS REPORTS AS WELL AS A CREATING A PROCESS TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES- UNDER THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. FOR THE INCREASE TO. HEALTH SERVICES ON THE GOVERNOR'S AGENDA BUDGET PROPOSAL DHC IS RICK. ELEVEN TOTAL FUNDS OF FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT LIMITED RESOURCES EQUIVALENT TO TWELVE POSITIONS AVAILABLE OVER FOUR YEARS. SO NOW GO INTO THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED REGARDING BOTH OF THE PROPOSALS- THE FIRST ONE REALLY IS IN REGARDS TO THE STATE'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES GAP- IN FEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF SAY YES. A DH IS THE STARTING THE WORK ON THE GAP ANALYSIS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- CONTINUING INFRASTRUCTURE- WE HAVE SECURED A CONTRACTOR WHO WOULD BE HELPING US OUT WITH THAT AND WE HAVE STARTED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE VHD EIGHT. IN REGARDS TO THAT GAP ANALYSIS WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THAT GAP ANALYSIS WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS ARE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR TO INFORM OF THE GRANTS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUE. ON OPPORTUNITY. I'M ALSO WE WOULD KNOW HE THAT THERE HUSBANDS FEEDBACK BY- FTA YOU REGARDING REQUESTS FOR. CHANGES TO BOTH PROPOSALS ALL GO BACK. THROUGH THE RESPONSES HERE. TO SPECIFIC TO THE BEHAVIORAL ONSTAR THE STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROPOSAL AT THE ARE YOU IS REQUESTING DOLLARS TO FLOW DIRECTLY TO THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. A DH CS DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT STRUCTURE WILL BE AS EFFECTIVE AS INCENTIVES THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. UNDER REALIGNMENT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS- YOU KNOW BOTH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BETWEEN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE NOT SPECIAL THESE SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH PLANS PROFESSIONALS- SERVICES UP AND MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPECIAL SPECIALTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. ARE BEING PROVIDED- INSTALLERS WERE TARGETED IN REGARDS TO MAKING SURE WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE UPSTREAM PREVENTATIVE EARLY INTERVENTION. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO COMPLEMENT A LOT OF THE GREAT WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE- BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IN COUNTY PARTNERS. ARE AT THE TABLE WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ON THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM PAID THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN BE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE BROADER SERVICES AVAILABLE IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL MATCH OF THOSE SERVICES. UNTIL YOU LEAVE WITH THE V. BEING ARE APPROXIMATE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE BY MAKING THAT RECOMMENDED CHANGES. AT THE GIVEN AS WE DO OUR RECOMMENDS THE PATH THAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED IN OUR. PROPOSAL- A DAY. AND WE'RE- TO ARE ONCE. THINLY REFORM IS IN FULL. I WOULDN'T HAVE OF INSTEAD CAME TO BE PAID COUNTIES ARE QUALIFIED- FOR FEDERAL MATCHING SO HERE WE JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THE WAY THAT THEY ARE STRUCTURED IN THIS PROPOSAL AND IN GENERAL- IS ONLY AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS FOR AT. RISK CAPITATED PLANS SO OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE RISK BEARING PLANS ON AND- THE MANAGER OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS THEY WOULD NOT BE RISK BEARING EVEN AFTER PAYMENT REFORM- HOWEVER- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE ENGAGE ON AFTER PAYMENT WERE HEART REFORM WITHOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I'M COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO- INSURE THAT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT DO GO TO THEM AREN'T CAUGHT UP IN THE COST RECONCILIATION PROCESS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW- AND SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE. WITH INCENTIVE PLANS BUT DIFFERENT IN REGARDS TO THE DRAWING DOWN OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE IN OUR- SCHOOL PROPOSAL TO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE SEPARATING THOSE TWO. PIECES AT NEXT QUESTION THE COMMITTEE HOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO WITH. A THE REASON- YOU KNOW FOR WHAT REASONS ARE SCHOOL BASED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS LIMITED TO K. THROUGH TWELVE. OF THE NOT OFF THE PROPOSED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. I'M HERE WE WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING TITLE AND AN ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS OFTEN EXTEND INTO ADULTHOOD. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HALF OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS START BY EACH OF FOURTEEN. ANOTHER AND MOST CASES ARE UNDETECTED OR UNTREATED AND MOST SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ALSO START IN ADOLESCENCE. OF THE WITH THE INCREASE IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALIZATIONS SUICIDE RATES OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN THE LAST DECADE. WE HAVE REALLY DECIDED TO FOCUS WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL- WITH. YOU KNOW FOR YOU FIX ANYTHING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS THESE. ADDITIONALLY A DH YES WE USES APPROPRIATE TO FOCUS INVESTMENT HERE- YOU KNOW INCLUDING HIGHER ED WOULD BE IMPORTANCE HOWEVER GIVEN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WE DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. TO INCENTIVIZE MEANINGFUL CHANGE NOT BROAD. OF THE GROUP BUT- VERY VALUABLE AND AN IMPORTANT SERVICES FOR US TO BE CONSIDERING IN THE IN THE FUTURE TO EXPAND ONTO HIGHER AGES IN REGARDS TO COMPREHENSIVE. ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES I JUST. WANTED TO MAKE SURE WINNER KATE THAT. ON THE NEXT QUESTION HOW TO DO WITH IT MINUTES. JERRY ON THE AND- FOR INTER THE PROPOSAL INTO INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS ALREADY MADE INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF STUDENTS SERVICES ACTION IN AN IMPORTANT QUESTION SO THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW REALLY ENVISIONS A FUTURE WHERE ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE COMPASSIONATE LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M FROM SCREENING AND PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION TO CLINICAL SERVICES WITHOUT BEER YEARS- OR WITHOUT DELAY. YOUNG PEOPLE DO ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEEK HELP ARE WHEN THEY START FEELING DISTRESSED ARE THEY WAITING TO HELP CRISIS- AND WE BELIEVE SERVICES SHOULD COME TO WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND THEIR TIME THAT SCHOOLS ARE PLACES AFFILIATED WITH SCHOOLS. BECAUSE BUILDING THE NEW SERVICES AND COMPLEX ENDEAVOR WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL MUST BUILD ON THE EXTENT OF WORK ALREADY DONE BY THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES AFTER IN THE WORK THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH ARMED SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. HAS DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OF REALLY LOOKING TO LIFT UP THOSE LESSONS LEARNED PARTNERSHIPS ARE YOU ENGAGE YOUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO EUROPE ADDITIONALLY OFFERS SOME OF THE EARLIER INTERVENTION. OF PREVENTION AND- NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. AND YOUTH IN SCHOOLS. WHEN IT COMES ACCOUNT. MEASURES A BEING BUILT INTO THE SCHOOL BASED PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS UTILIZED THE FUNDS TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE SCHOOL BASED NEEDS- DCS. INTENDS TO DESIGN THE INCENTIVE MILESTONES AND THAT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY COORDINATING WITH THE SCHOOL OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. OR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS WELL AS PARTNERING WITH- THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. I'M SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS TO DRAWDOWN INCENTIVE THAT BE A REQUIREMENT OF. OF GETTING THOSE INCENTIVES. WERE ACTUALLY- ALSO ENGAGING IN LARGE CONVERSATIONS I WAS SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ADVOCATES AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YOU CAN BE BACK ON WHAT THOSE INCENTIVES SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE MILESTONES BUT BUT A LOT. OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT DRIVE DOWN THOSE FUNDS IN WHO SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. I'M IN SO LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU- ADDITIONAL DETAILS THE DEPARTMENT DID RELEASE AN UPDATED OUR PROPOSAL ON THIS. ITEM WHERE WE GAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE- HEARD FROM OTHERS IN REGRESSION NEEDING TO BE IN THERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER ENGAGE WITH REGARDS TO FINE TUNING THE INCENTIVE. PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. I DO. OTHER NEXT COURSE HOUSE DO WITH- AT WHICH PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUT TO BE. UNBELIEVABLE SIGNIFICANTLY SEEK TO MAKE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MARK FESTIVAL- TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION- SO I WILL SPEAK IN REGARDS TO YOU AS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUTSIDE OF WHAT DH CS- OVERSEAS DIFFER TO THOSE AREAS. HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW TERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT AIM TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I'M CALTRAIN BEING ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THERE WILL BE HARD THE PROPOSAL FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT ONE OF THE TARGET FOR OUR POPULATIONS OF FOCUS ARE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS- WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS A COMPREHENSIVE. OFFERING OF THE FLU OF SERVICES FOR HOUSING. INCLUDING NAVIGATION SERVICES AS SECURITY DEPOSITS- BA'S ON SERVICES ONCE SOMEONE'S HOUSE AS WELL AS RETRIBUTIVE CARE- IN OTHER OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS. ADDITIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY THE GOVERNOR IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. INCLUDING ON THE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY TO REALLY HELP ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL HELP PROVIDE CARE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS I'M AND THEN USE THESE EPISODES THE CHARACTER AND NOT. THE HOUSING SERVICES THE REALLY THINK THAT THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. MADE ARE MADE THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL AS OUR DFS CALLING. UP AND WE HAVE BEEN PARTNERING TO ENSURE THOSE SERVICES TOGETHER TO YOU ADDRESS. THE NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- AND THEY JUST SAY I'M IN THE STATE MANDATES FOR COUNTY. IMAGE OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FUNDING ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. OF WHICH WERE THE IN MORE THAN NINE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- SO THE- HERE IS ARE COUNTIES CONSISTENT FOLLOWING THIS EXPENDITURE. AND HOW WITH THE GOVERNOR'S INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL LEVERAGE THE- INVESTMENT. SO HERE WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT THE COUNTIES ARE UTILIZING THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FUNDS TO PROVIDE SERVICES INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN BOTH START UP. PARTNERSHIPS IN THE LAST PUBLICLY REPORTED. YEAR WHICH IS EIGHTEEN. IN REGARDS TO WHAT POSTED 88% OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICE SUPPORTS FUNDING WAS SPENT ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. IDEAS THE IS NOT RECEIVED. ALL OF THE DAY. OF FOR THE NAY EXPAND REPORT. OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY HOWEVER- AND YOU TO SOME THIS LABOR. OUT WE HAVE NO. FINISHED ARE NOW- HOW WE DO INTO THE THAT THE- I OUR- TO USE THOSE ON THOSE BY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO FOR THIRD SERVICE PARTNERS IN THE- HOUSING HERE. LIKE THE PROPOSED IN THE IN. PROPOSAL ADDITIONALLY A WHICH IS NO BIG CAN ALSO LEVERAGE PROPOSED FUNDS THAT THE IMAGE OF CAP FACILITY. NEEDS FOR. AND BUILDING PURCHASES. AS OF THIS END MIKE AT. HOW IN ANY. BUT IT IS A. UNDERSTANDING THE CONTINUE OF CARE THAT WE HAVE AND THE GAPS IN THAT SYSTEM. AND BEGINNING TO PUT IN PLACE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT. THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THESE KINDS OF PROPOSALS WE REALLY START WITH THE PREMISE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED THEM THROUGH A RANGE OF STRATEGIES SO WITH REGARD TO THE SCHOOLS PROPOSAL. AND THE QUESTION ABOUT MEDICARE MEDICARE PLANS. AS WITH COMMENTED ON- IN THE STATE HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AMOUNT HOSTED SERVICES ACTIVE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT. AND A NUMBER OF COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING OUT ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR SCHOOLS AND WE'RE HOPING THROUGH. FULL SUPPORT MORE THAN HAS BEEN SERVICES ACT THAT WE CAN EXPAND THE SIMILAR GRANT FUNDING TO ALL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BUILD UPON THAT FOUNDATION IN WAYS THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO ARE SERVED THROUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT EVEN COMMERCIAL PLANES. STONE THANK YOUNG THE COMMISSION PERSPECTIVE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE MAKING AN ON AN ONGOING INVESTMENT IN. EXPAND ADDED WE HOPE OVER TIME WE CAN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS WITH MEDICARE PLANS AND OTHERS BEGIN TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS WERE SERVING. RATHER THAN STARTING WITH THE FUNDING THE DESIGN OF THE FUNDING THAT WE BRING TO THE TABLE. I DO WANT TO COMMENT- BASED ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE ANALYSIS OR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR EARLIEST CHILDREN OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS AND SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY THROUGH A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION LANDS. AND ON AND ON THAT POINT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR HIGHER AT I WAS IN A MEETING TODAY WITH THE UC REGENTS THEY COMMENTED THAT ABOUT 10% SLIGHTLY UNDER TEN PERCENT. OF THE UC STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. WITH ANTICIPATE THAT BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE CSU SYSTEM AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD BE HIGHER IN TERMS OF A MEDIC CAL ENROLLEES- BUT I. DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE SCHOOLS AS A PATHWAY TO SUPPORT BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS AGAIN DO A PREVENTION ANDINTERVENTION STRATEGY IS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR EARLY LEARNERS AS WELL AS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. SO ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT WE JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE VERY. SIMILAR CONCERNS AND WE SEE. TREMENDOUS COOPER. FOR PAR BUT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE COLLEGE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AND EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN REALLY STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF CARE. IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN DESIGN CARE- THAT IS RESPONSIVE RESPONSIVE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN TODAY WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE BACK IN OUR- IN OUR WORLD WE REALLY THINK ABOUT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. IN IN TERMS OF- YEAH THE BROADER INVESTMENT AROUND MEDICAL OPPORTUNITIES THE QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED IS WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE COULD WE BE DOING HERE- CHILDREN HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT ENTITLEMENT UNDER MEDICARE FOR SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT AND WE TALKED DURING THE EARLIER ITEM AROUND BETTER USING DATA IN PROCESS AYE PREVENTION THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE ALSO NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AROUND WHO IS ACCESSING CARE WHO'S NOT ACCESSING CARE AND THE GAP FIFTY THIRTY IN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS ARE OUT THERE WHAT NEEDS ARE BEING MET SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO PUT IN PLACE A STRATEGY TO CLOSE THAT GAP. M. WE WANT THAT TO BE DONE THROUGH AN UPSTREAM PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL PREVENTION STRATEGY AS WE CAN IMAGINE. THAT REALLY WOULD ALLOW US TO BOTH IF WE UNDERSTOOD THOSE GAPS IF WE UNDERSTOOD THE PATHWAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE PURSUING TO SEE CARE IT WOULD ALLOW US TO STRENGTHEN OUR MEDIC CAL. IN RELATED ACCESS STRATEGIES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE ANALYSIS FOR MANY YEARS AROUND MOBILE AND OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND MOBILE. I THINK YOU KNOW IN OUR SOCIETY WE HAVE MOVED TOWARDS MOBILE BUT WE ALSO MOVE TOWARDS DIGITAL ART AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION YOU HAD EARLIER TODAY AROUND REIMBURSEMENTS FOR VIRTUAL CARE. AND I THINK THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN AS NIMBLE IN MOVING TOWARDS MOBILE AND VIRTUAL AS WE COULD BE I THINK THAT'S TRUE ACROSS EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR NOT NOT UNIQUE TO HEALTHCARE IN SOME WAYS IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND HEALTH CARE AS EVIDENCED BY THE CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD. EARLIER IN THE AGENDA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY ARE EXCITED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS MOBILE BASED CARE. AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR CRISIS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE LIMITED TO CRISIS RESPONSE PARTICULARLY. IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS ACCESS CHALLENGES IF WE WAT TO ADDRESS INEQUITY ISSUES OR DISPARITIES ISSUES. MOBILE ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY RESPOND THE NEEDS WITHIN INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING RATHER THAN ASKING PEOPLE TO ADAPT THERE NEEDS TO THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. AND SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE STATE WOULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN MOBILE STRATEGIES IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH pIS THAT ARE ALREADY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. SO WE THINK THIS SHIFT TOWARDS MOBILE IS IMPORTANT NEEDS TO BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. OF A BROADER CONVERSATION AROUND HOW WE CAN BETTER RESPOND. TO THE NEEDS ACROSS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE BROADER COMMENT ABOUT WHAT OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES HERE I JUST WANT TO ADD A COUPLE OF. POINTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ONE IS- IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RAPIDLY RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND ALL OF ITS RELATED. ISSUES IS THE MEDICAL SERVICES STUDENT SERVICES ACT INCLUDES TWENTY COUNTIES THAT ARE WHAT WE CALL SHOVEL READY. THEY'RE READY TO GO. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND THEM BECAUSE LIMITS IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE COMMISSION RECEIVED. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THOSE DOLLARS OUT IN SIXTY DAYS OR LESS TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTIES CAN RECEIVE THEM THAT BATH WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. THAT COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SCHOOL BASED STRATEGIES IN TIME FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IN THE FALL. BUT IT MEANS THAT WE WOULD AT LEAST HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO. ENGAGE IN TIME FOR. KNOWS THAT DOESN'T. SCHOOL STARTS. HE WILL BE IN TECH ASSIST WILL BE. IMPORTANT IN THIS EFFORT SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE LEARNING THAT THAT SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES AND I WOULD ADD WE HOPE MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL GO THROUGH AS THEY BEGIN. TO BUILD OUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS. AND SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN BUILDING OUT THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH IS A MOBILE SYSTEM TO RESPOND. TO CHILDREN INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WE THINK THAT THAT'S A MODEL. THAT THE STATE SHOULD LOOK AT A BUILDING UPON THEM FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE IT'S AVAILABLE. AND IT WOULD ALLOW US TO RAMP UP RELATIVELY QUICKLY RELATIVE TO OTHER KINDS OF APPROACHES. THERE ARE OTHER MODELS OUT THERE WE ARE COUNTIES HAVE REALLY BEEN LEADING THE WAY. IN STEPPING INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT THE AC TO SERVE THEIR THEIR ROUND MENTAL HEALTH- NEEDS SONOMA COUNTY IN PARTICULAR HAS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISASTER RESPONSE STRATEGY THAT WAS BUILT FROM THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE. OF MULTIPLE DISASTERS IN A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME USING FEDERAL FUNDS THAT REALLY IS CENTERED ON UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SCREENS FOR ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT COUNTY. AND THEN FOLLOWING UP WITH TRAUMA FOCUSED- A RESPONSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S SOME INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THAT IS ON THE AGENDA FOR YOU TODAY SOME OF IT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. YOU ARE COUNTY PARTNERS AND WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS THE STATE THINKS ABOUT. MAKING INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR CAN WE LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF THE EXISTING PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY. IN RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS THAT YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT WILL ENTERTAIN ARE HITTING US TODAY. AND THAT IN MANY WAYS WILL BE- MORE SEVERE AS WE AS WE CONTINUE TO RE OPEN AND PEOPLE COME TO TERMS WITH. THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON THEIR FAMILIES AND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY CARED ABOUT. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE STATE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN TERMS OF ITS CAL HOPE COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS IT'S WARM LINES- ARE VIRTUAL AND DIGITAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SUPPORT MOST READ PARTNERSHIPS WERE MENTIONED. THESE ARE ALL AREAS WHERE ASKED THE STATE THINKS ABOUT EXPANDING ITS INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY THAT THAT IN MANY WAYS LIKE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. AS WAS COMMENTED IT'S OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN COUNTY INVESTMENT. THAT'S A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE THE TYPICALLY IF WE CAN BUILD UPON AND STRENGTHEN THAT FUNDING STREAMS ALLOW US. TO SUSTAIN OUR EFFORTS OVER TIME. I'M THAT MY RESPONSES TO THE QUESTION IN THE- BUT I'D BE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE. TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY ON THIS CHALLENGE. THANK YOU MISTER EWING WILL NEXT HEAR FROM PHILLY OKAY ARE TO. THANK YOU. RIGHT INTO THE FIRST QUESTION% THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING COUNTIES AT ALL SOME OF THE BUDGET THAT ADDRESSES CHALLENGES IN FUNDING WOULD BE OUR OUR GREATEST CHALLENGE IN THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I'M I WANT TO MENTION NOTABLY IN THE MEDICARE SYSTEM WAS SPECIFICALLY WITH REALIGNMENT I THINK THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT MENTAL HEALTH REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ARE ACTUALLY LESS THAN THE REVENUES THAT WE RECEIVED IN FISCAL YEAR FOUR OH FIVE. AND. TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT THE COUNT REVENUES. TWENTY TWO COVER FOX THE 65% OF THE REQUIRED STATE AND LOCAL MATCH FOR MEDICAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH E. PSEG SERVICES AND DRUG MEDI CAL SERVICES WITH THE WITH OTHER COUNTY AND STATE FUNDING BEING USED TO. FILL THAT GAP IN PARTICULAR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. THE NAME OF NAME TO A LITTLE BIT. IN THE DIALOGUE HALF OF THAT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARGUES AS NON FEDERAL SHARE TO MATCH FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. THE ADMINISTRATION HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING- SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. REALLY PROPOSED. THING IS AN UNPRECEDENTED LAST MINUTE MAYBE HERE HEALTH SYSTEMS MUST READ THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR- ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN PART ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS EXPRESSED ITS COMMITMENT TO SECURE AND I IN THE WAIVER WHICH WILL BE VERY VERY BENEFICIAL TO YOU COUNTY HEALTH AND OF COURSE KELLY PAYMENT REFORMS TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO ANNOUNCED A TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR INITIATIVE SEEKING TO TRANCE WARMED THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN ACROSS ALL PAYERS. IT'S HEARTENING THAT THE PROPOSAL'S GONNA INCLUDE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MORE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETING SPECIFICALLY CHILDREN YOUTH AMONG OTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE CONTINUE TO BE EXCITED TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO BE FEDERAL HEALTH AND LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE DETAILS ON THIS NEW IMPORTANT INITIATIVE YES YES IS ALSO PROPOSED REVISIONS TO COVERAGE TO COVERAGE AND PAYMENT CRITERIA ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH I'M INCLUDING THE ELIMINATION INCLUDE INCLUDING THE CHILDREN EIGHT INCLUDED DIAGNOSIS OR AT THE PRETTY WHACKED REQUISITE FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN ADDITION TO GET YES PROPOSES THAT CHILDREN WITH HISTORY. OF TRAUMA AMONG. ONLY ONE BALL BUT WHICH CHILD. I ALEX THE CLEAR FOR. FINALLY PROPOSED UPDATES TO THE DRUG MAY CAL WORK DELIVERY SYSTEM SPECIFIED YOU NEED FOR A TWENTY GAUGER SUBSTANCE USE ARE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AS PART OF THE FEDERAL HE PSTG MANDATE AND THAT ADULTS MAY RECEIVE REIMBURSABLE SUV SERVICES DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD EVEN IF ULTIMATELY THEY'RE DETERMINED NOT TO MEET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. AB EIGHT STATES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THESE CHANGES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO BE HERE ALL SERVICES DRAMATIC HELP I ALSO WANTED TO BRIEFLY MENTION ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE CURRENTLY ON FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS IS STRICTLY LIMITED TO THE COSTS TO PROVIDE EACH MEDICAL SERVICE LIMITING OUR ABILITY- FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO INVEST IN SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS THE ADMINISTRATION AS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. IS PROPOSING WITH CBH CBH THE ASTRON SUPPORT TO IMPLEMENT PAYMENT REFORM INCLUDING TRANSITIONING FROM WHAT WE CURRENTLY USE OUR CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE CURRENT COPY SYSTEM TO INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS- IDT'S WE BELIEVE AS J. C. MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO GREATER EFFICIENCY AND THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN OUR SYSTEM. I'M QUESTION TO ASK ABOUT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MISSING AND THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- WE WOULD IDENTIFY THE UNIQUE AND COMPLEX NEEDS I THINK THE TOOLS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND THOSE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE SUVS REQUIRING THAT REQUIRING BECAUSE OF THEIR NEEDS TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. WHICH IS STILL MORE TRUE. DOUBLES THAT ARE EXPERT HOME. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SIX. COMMITTED TO CONFRONT THE F HOMELESSNESS IN THE- HOWEVER. THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT ALSO HAVE THE HIT RUN HEALTH NEEDS ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED WITH- WITH CHECK WITH- ISSUE THE PROPOSAL SUCH AS SATISFIED. MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WILL REMAIN UNSERVED THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS NECESSARY TO STABLY HOUSE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. ARE OFTEN ABSENT FROM INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE'RE HOPEFUL WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADDITIONAL EFFORTS BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HOMELESSNESS THAT THOSE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE. POTENTIALLY SOME SET ASIDE FOR TARGETED EFFORTS AT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION. WE WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS AS POTENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT'S MISSING MISSING THE MINISTRATION HASN'T MADE A PRIOR FORTY MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM THESE INVESTMENTS ARE WELCOME AND MUCH NEEDED. SIMILAR EFFORTS. WHAT WORK NEEDS TO SERVE THOSE WITH SUBSTANCE THAT. ALSO THE HERBAL AGENCIES WILL BE PAYING COST FOR MEDIC CAL CERTIFIED PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST AS A COUNTY OPTIONAL BENEFITS THIS VALUABLE WORK. FORCE MERIT A STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH CAN ONLY BE. EIGHT INVESTMENT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IDENTIFIED BY UCSF HEALTH CARE CENTER RAISES ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL PROFESSIONS THAT NEED A STATE INVESTMENT TO BE HERE HELP DELIVER SYSTEMS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SHORTAGES WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW WITHOUT INVESTMENT INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED 41% FEWER PSYCHIATRIST. NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED TODAY MAY INCLUDE SOME WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LOOK AT THE LOOKING AFTER. I'M MOVING TO QUESTION THREE THAT URGENT AND IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION THAT THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER I ALSO WANTED TO COVER THAT THE KIDS ISSUE AND WORKFORCE. FROM THE ORDER OF THE. FULL FUNDING OF WHAT I'M- DR YOU INTO AS SHOP READY A MENTAL HEALTH STUDENTS. ACT I'M PROGRAMS WERE TRONG SUPPORT OF THAT WE ARE ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE STATE'S MANAGE UNDERSTANDABLE HEALTH- I WE ALSO SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO GET YOUR GRIP AND FEDERATION YOUR APPROVING OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS INC IN COUNTY SERVICES SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS AND SERVICES AND MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES. CREEK WHAT. OF THE USER RECEIVE TREATMENT AT SCHOOL INCLUDING ONE THIRD ABOUT RECEIVE SERVICES FOR BOTH SOME OF THE SEARCH RESTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND ITS CHILDREN RICK RETURNED TO SCHOOL THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SERVICES WILL BE MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER PRE AND POST THEM PANDEMIC COUNTY HERE WILL HELP PLANTS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SPECIAL TV APRIL HEALTH SERVICES TO ALL CHILDREN A MEDIC CAL CONSISTENT WITH THE E. P. STT ENTITLEMENT. GIVEN THE FACT THAT OVER HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL COUNTIES REALIZE THAT SCHOOLS ARE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO IDENTIFY AND OUTREACH TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES HAVE BEEN PARTNERING FOR OVER A DECADE WITH LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS. TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF PREVENTION. AND TREAT SERVICES IT WASN'T IN JANUARY. IF THE TV HD SURVEY NUMBER AND FOUND THAT 80% OF THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL. THE ON SPOKANE. AT FORT AND AT THE- RISK OF DEATH WHICH IS 96% OF ALL MEMBERS FOR OVER. IT ADDED THAT FOR EIGHTY. AND SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN THEIR COUNTY. WE'VE BEEN IN SCHOOLS PROVIDE. AND WE WILL TAKE YOU TO ON ARCTIC IF THE PRINCIPLES THAT KEEP EVERYTHING PARTNERS HAVE OF THE CAN RISK. 50% OF JOHN VIDAK APARTMENTS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ON CAMPUS TODAY'S AT UT SERVICES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN A- YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. A CO OCCURRING HEALTH AND SO FOR IT ALL A- GET READY OUR EFFORTS. IN SCHOOLS. IF YOU NEEDS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STATED OF THE MOTHER IF THE LET TURN THE IMAGE FOR THE ACROSS SERVICE AS CHILDREN LET'S GO SERVICE THE- MISS WE ARE NOW ON THE URGENT ABOUT IN THE NOW HI I MAY YOU TO TURN THE VIDEO IF WE'RE HAVING SOME- FEEDBACK AND SO LET'S SEE IF THAT. HELPS TO IMPROVE HELP. DO YOU. AT AND I WAS ON I WOULD LIKE ON MY VERY LAST BUT THE WAY- SO WE TRY URGE INVESTMENT IN THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS A CRITICALLY KEY INVESTMENT. APOLOGIES FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AB. NO WORRIES ZERO ON THE NEXT PANEL SO I JUST WANTED TO GET IT. CORRECT SO THAT WERE- PREPARED FOR THAT- WITHOUT A WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DICE AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I DO WANNA ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- ON THE- BE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- CONTINUE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM TRAVEL- ENTITIES ARE PROVIDED GRANTS FOR ASSISTING WITH STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PROGRAM AND COUNT HOW CAN WE ENSURE A PROPER AMOUNT OF FINANCING GOES TO SUPPORT TRIBAL STUDENTS. ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT SO- WE HAVE FULL INTENTIONS OF FULLY ENGAGING WITH OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS IN REGARDS TO- THE AVAILABLE FUNDS- AND WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE GRANTS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE- AND- THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULDN'T JUST BE FOR THE COUNTIES- PROVIDED DIRECTLY WITH OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS AS WELL. WITH WITH THAT THAT ALSO INCLUDES A DISCUSSION AND FUNDING THAT- CENTERS AROUND- SERVICES FOR CRISIS STABILIZATION AND CRISIS RESPONSE ALSO. WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THAT IS CORRECT SO FOR THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUE ON DOLLARS. I'LL E FULLY PLAN ON ENGAGING WITH OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE. BEEN BILLED THOSE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO- TO THEIR MEMBERS. THANK THANK YOU MISTER TRANSPLANT YOU FOR THAT MA'AM AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO HELP FACILITATE ANY OF THOSE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE. THANK THANK YOU UP BEFORE I BEGIN I DO WANNA SAY HOW EXCITED I AM ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORM SPECIFICALLY THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT WILL. ALLOW FOR US TO DO EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND- OFTENTIMES DOES NOT GO SAID ENOUGH HOW MUCH THE ADMINISTRATION IS LEADING IN THIS TIME AND- JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO MAKE SURE TO APPRECIATE YOU. I DO WANT TO ECHO WHAT TOBY EWING SAID THE WITCHES I'M NOT SURE WE CAN WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS- MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WILL BE MORE SEVERE IF WE DO THAT. AND SO I'M HOPING IF I COULD TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT. HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE. APPLYING TO ALL OF OR CHILDREN. SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON TOBY YOUNG'S COMMENT REGARDING FIRST WHICH IS ONLY APPLIED TO OUR FOSTER KIDS. ARE THESE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE IS IT SOMETHING WE IS THE- LEGISLATURE CAN ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CRISIS SERVICES. COULD POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL. SO THAT COMES WITH A AROUND- THE MOBILE CRISIS I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE US- THAT FOR EXAMPLE EVEN WITHIN. THE R. P. ACT AVAILABLE WE'D BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. OF UP 285% OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS. AN ANTICIPATING AND WAITING FOR CMS GUIDANCE IN REGARDS TO THE MOBILE CRISIS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD BE A ACROSS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TO BE CLEAR THAT WOULD INCLUDE BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS SO I THINK THERE. WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO EXPAND OUR MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE IN CALIFORNIA- IN THE FUTURE INTENDING THAT CMS GUIDANCE WE'D BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS TO. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE- NOW MIND YOU IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS YOUR COMMENT OF WHAT WE DO TODAY. A BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE STARTING IN NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ABOUT WHAT WE PLAN ON DOING WHATEVER WE CAN TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH RISKS INCLUDING. A MOBILE CRISIS AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. AND THEN WE JUST NOTE- YOU KNOW ABOUT NOT AT CURRENTLY ARE ON THE AGENDA TODAY THAT DEPARTMENT- AND AGENCY I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE REGARDS TO THE BROADER- CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSAL THAT WAS MENTIONED. GIVEN THAT IT IS FOR ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THAT ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND SO. HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW FOR AN EXTENSIVE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE. I BELIEVE FOR US TO GET UP AND RUNNING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IT'S BETTER FOR US TO BUILD WITHIN THE PROGRAMS WE CURRENTLY HAVE UP AND RUNNING THAN TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND- THUS LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. I'M I DO WANT TO- FOLLOW UP ON THE GAP ANALYSIS WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. C. PHD A I WOULD- A PRECIADO IF WHEN THEY IS COME. AT THE OF THIS YEAR. MY OFFICE IS A TO SEE GAP ANALYSIS ON. TRYING TO UNDER. THE CAN- AND WHERE ARE GAPS ARE. AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS AND- AND SO JUST WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT AS IT'S COMING OUT. BUT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP IF I COULD ON ONE OF C. B. H. D. A.'S COMMENTS WHICH IS- THESE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO HELP TO BUILD NEW BRICK AND MORTAR NEW. FACILITIES BUT- WHO'S GONNA WORK AT THOSE FACILITIES AND HOW ARE WE- HELPING TO STAFF UP THOSE FACILITIES I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON. FOR OBSERVE THAT IS CORRECTING THE DOLLARS WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL R. FOR- THAT THE FACILITIES WHETHER THAT'S NEW CONSTRUCTION OR ACQUISITION OR OTHER MODELING OF FACILITIES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS- AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S WITHIN THE- THE- CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH AT LEAST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSAL THAT THE BOARD WE ALSO ARE EXPANDING. ON DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE REGARDS ABOUT PROPOSAL AND THE WORKFORCE DOLLARS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR US TO INCREASE SOME OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. I'M AS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A VERY VALID POINT IN REGARDS YOU OF THE NEED TO INCREASE THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT IF THE ADMINISTRATION VERY COMMITTED. TO THE THAT. YOU WILL FIND A VERY WILLING PARTNER IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR WORKFORCE EARLIER WE MENTIONED WE CAN REPLICATE THEM OR MANUFACTURE THEM AND- REALLY BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GROOM OUR OWN. REALLY HAVE ENJOYED HELL YOU HAVE- ADVANCED PEER CERTIFICATION AS A MODEL FOR US AND I JUST AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE. ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. WITH. THAT WE WILL. ISSUE NOT OKAY. RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR JUST HAD A HEAD OF A NEW THOUGHT- WHEN WE LOOK AT. PISSED ALL THE MONEY THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT IN BEHAVIOR. OF WORLD UNTIL HEALTH AND ONE NINE HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF. IT IS TRY. PERFORMANCE WITHOUT. WITH MY SPENT. WHERE WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE GOTTEN THEM ON ON TRACK. FOR YOU KNOW BASICALLY IS THERE AN EXPENDITURE EMPLOYEE OF PLAN IN PLACE THEN IT ALSO TRACKS OUTCOMES AND WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE THIS YEAR AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL MONIES THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET NEXT YEAR. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A COMPOST THIS MUCH MORE YOU'VE SERVICED AND HELPED. THIS MANY MORE PEOPLE DO WE HAVE THAT. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- HISTORICALLY- WE HAVE NOT DONE AS GOOD AS I THINK WE SHOULD IN REGARDS TO YOU- BOTH UTILIZATION DATA ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN MEDIC CAL. AS WELL AS QUALITY AND OUTCOME MEASURES- SO THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY RECENTLY JUST HIRED A CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HER COME ON BOARD IN ONE OF THE AREAS THAT SHE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IS FIRST COMING UP WITH IN REVAMPING. THE DEPARTMENT'S COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY STRATEGY ARE IN ONE OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF THAT QUALITY STRATEGY IS TO REALLY LIFT UP OUR- OVERSIGHT IN REALLY MORE THAT KIND OF- YOU KNOW QUALITY AND ACCESS AND- OUTCOMES. OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD PAYMER FORM AND THE ABILITY TO GET ADDITIONAL DATA AND- DETAILED INFORMATION FROM OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. A REAL LOOKING TO LEVERAGE THAT IN THE FUTURE SO WE HAVE SOME REPORTS WHICH WE HAVE ONLINE BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU A LINK TO THAT INFORMATION. HOWEVER WE ARE REALLY STARTING TO DO INITIAL PLANNING FOR WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND HOW WE CAN HAVE MORE ACCESS TO DATA OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OUTPUT FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- SAID. I WOULD SAY THOUGH WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF- AT YOU KNOW THE DALLAS EITHER EVALUATIONS ON SOME OF OUR BLOCK GRANT- AT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPIOID WORK WE'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE ANY OF THAT REFERENCED INFORMATION WITH US WELL. KNOWN APPRECIATE THAT BUT WHAT I'M SAYING YOU IS WITH A BUSINESS PLAN IN PLACE THE SHOWS. WHAT WAS IT ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES WITH. WHAT OUTCOMES WORK ACCOMPLISHED. IT HELPS US. EXPAND ON THE INVESTMENT YOU SHOW US THAT THE AGE. HAS BEEN. AT THIS LEVEL AND WHEN WE'VE MADE THIS MUCH OF AN INVESTMENT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THIS. AND WE CAN GO FOR FURTHER WITH REAL GOOD. SOLID DATA TO BACK UP THE- ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT. WOULD BE NEEDED. BUT I MEAN THAT'S HOW I MEAN THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. YOU KNOW WHICH WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW IN MY COUNTY SOLANO COUNTY MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE STILL DON'T HAVE. PEDIATRIC CRISIS CRISIS BEDS. AND I'VE BEEN. CALLING FOR THAT FOR NINE YEARS NOW THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND AGAIN. THE CRISIS BUT HAPPENS TO BE JUVENILE HALL. IN AN SWELLED COUNTY SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE QUANTIFIABLE. DATA THAT IT WILL YOU WILL YOU HAVE. OUTSTANDING OUTCOMES WITH THIS WITH INVESTMENT WE CAN WE CAN BE A BIGGER PROPONENT OF FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR. YEAH THANK YOU WE FOR- WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK TO BUILD THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE OUTCOMES OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN SELF WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AND AGREE WITH YOU THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVEPEDIATRIC CRISIS- ACCESS TO SERVICES AND THAT IS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING THIS INVESTMENT WILL HELP US- CLOSE THE GAP ON. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. IT THE FUND MANAGER BRING AND TELL YOU IN FOR A COMMENT ON THIS. QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IT'S IN THAT CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE LAST FEW YEARS- YOU KNOW I AM SURE THAT THE COMMISSION STRATEGY PART OF OUR OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY STRATEGY. IS TO HAVE A CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE WAY TO REFLECT FIRST SPENDING YOUR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ENTIRE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THE COMMISSION AND START WITH THEM AND TO SAY FUNDS BAD PART OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF W WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE BROADER PUBLIC INVESTMENT WE NEED TO PUT SOME NUMBERS OUT THERE AND MONITOR THOSE. THE SECOND PIECE IS IN THIS GETS TO PREVENT FRAZIER COMMENT HERE'S WHAT WE SPENDING THESE DOLLARS ON AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO REFLECT. THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED WITH. THE DOLLARS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE. FROM FROM OUR TAX PAYER. AND THE THIRD. OF THAT DISCUSSION IS WHAT OUTCOMES BEING AND- THIS IS A M. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WE DON'T HAVE GOOD MODELS. IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN SOME WAYS WE HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS IN MENTAL HEALTH. AND IT'S TRUE IN OTHER SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA OR ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. WE CAN'T. WITH IN A VERY LIMITED STANDS. POINT OUT THAT WE CAN WE CAN SHOW THAT FOR BOTH SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE HISTORY. THAT WHEN THEY ENTER THESE PROGRAMS. AND UPON GRADUATION THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. IN RE ARREST RATES AND EVEN OVER TIME AS PEOPLE LEAVE THESE PROGRAMS WILL WE SEE A REDUCTION AS HIGH AS 69% 59% REDUCTION CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. FOLLOWING PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS. PART OF THE REASON THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE VALUE A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. FIRST AND OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT IS A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT THAT IS THAT WE ARE MAKING ANNUALLY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INVESTMENT IS HAVING THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WE DON'T KNOW I'M A LITTLE IN THE DATA THAT I JUST SHARED ABOUT HOW FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE HELPING PEOPLE AVOID THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH WE THINK IS ESSENTIAL. FOR IN CALIFORNIA IS WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTICIPATION IN A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP OR LACK OF PARTICIPATION IN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEONE BECOMES. ENOUGH LANDS IN THE STATE HOSPITAL WITH AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DESIGNATION BECAUSE OF A FELONY CHARGE. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TRAJECTORY OF HOW PEOPLE WHO DO OR DO NOT RECEIVE A SET A RANGE OF SERVICES. END UP IN A VERY EXPENSIVE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM OR THEY AVOID THAT VERY EXPENSIVE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING TO BUILD. OUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMMING. WE WANT TO WRECK. THAT THE GENERATE BE AVERAGE DURATION OF UNFIT PSYCHOSIS IN THE UNITED STATES. IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE DATA FOR SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA. AND THE NATIONAL STANDARDS. INDICATE THAT THAT REALLY SHOULD BE TWO TO FOUR WEEKS. IN THE UK STANDARD IS TWO WEEKS. AND SO WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF WE IMPROVE ACCESS EARLY ACCESS TO. PSYCHOSIS SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THEIR FIRST PSYCHOTIC EPISODE CANNOT REDUCE RELIANCE ON A VERY EXPENSIVE COMMUNITY BASED FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. AND CAN FALL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS REDUCE RELIANCE ON EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE HOSPITAL BASED CARE. THERE'S A NUMBER OF STUDENT COBBLED CHAINS ARE LINKED SERVICES IN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM WHERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK INVESTMENTS. RECOGNIZE THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING BE ABLE TO DO THE ANALYSIS TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. AND THEN DO THE MATH AROUND THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE HAVING ON OUR BOTTOM LINE. ON THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACHIEVING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT ONLY ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BASED CARE WHICH IS A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. ARE THERE WITH A PSYCHOSIS BAGNAIA DIAGNOSIS WHICH SUGGESTS WE MAY NOT BE USING THAT RESOURCE AS STRATEGICALLY. AS AS IS NECESSARY SO WE ARE COULD. TELL MEMBER FRAZIER WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT THE VISION THAT YOU HAVE ARTICULATED- IT IS VERY CHALLENGING. THERE'S LOTS OF STEPS TO GET THAT DONE I THINK WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE BUT WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT WORK DRAMATICALLY. SO THAT YOU AND THE PUBLIC HAVE THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT INVESTING IN EXPANDED CARE. THE TYPE OF CARE WE INVEST IN AND OPPORTUNITIES IDEALLY OR HIGHLY. EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. THANK YOU MISTER EWING MAY BRING IN- MISS K. RD. AFRICAN ON SUBJECT MISTER. IT'S ACTUALLY UNDER LOCK I WAS ACTUALLY IN A POINT TO THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY OFFERING A WITH CBH DHCP H. K. AND C. PAN- AB SIX EIGHT SIX. WHICH IS TRYING TO LOOK AT DEVELOPING STATEWIDE OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO HOLD THE COUNTY RESULTS. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MANY PUBLIC FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE WE'RE LOOKING AT CREATING AN ENTIRE WORKGROUP THAT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED WITH. THE EXPERTS THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM SO WE WOULD BE BRINGING AND- THE COMMISSION WE WOULD BE BRINGING ANTI EIGHT CS AND OTHER FOLKS TO TOUCH OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM AND WE WANT TO HAVE A STRONG FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY REDUCTION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES. SO ARBIL IS A TO YOUR BILL BUT IT IS INTENDED THAT YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOME MEASURES WHERE WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SEE HOW WE ARE. PERFORMING AS A SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO ONE OF THE THINGS POPPED INTO MY MIND ALSO AS I'VE HEARD THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH. WITH DIFFERENT ENTITIES. BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH REGIONAL CENERS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED. IS THERE A FACET OF COLLABORATION IS GOING. THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT WITH REGIONAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN SILENT. AND I'M I'M LOOKING TOWARDS THAT- TO DO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER PUSH THAT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH YOUR GUIDANCE FOR. BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT TODAY AS A PARTNERSHIP OR OF. OF A PLACE TO FOCUS. MS COOPER DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE COMMENTING ON THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY IS- I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED I'M NOT AS ATTUNED TO OF WHERE WE ARE INTEGRATING SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT WAY I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A HANDFUL OF WORK BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT ONE BACK BREAKING IN AND IN CONCERT WITH MY TEAM AND GET BACK TO YOU. YEAH I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD FOLLOW UP WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER HE'S BEEN A CHAMPION IN THE SPACE AND- WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR HERE I NAY COMMENT ON THEM. YES MISTER YOU WANT. SO- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEOPLE WE'RE SERVING AND THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BEING SIR WOULD REALLY. HELP US MAKE RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS SO WE'VE HAD SOME RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH EXPERTS AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS. WHO ARE. OUR PARTNERS IN DESIGNING OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMMING AND I DON'T HAVE THE PERCENTAGE IN FRONT OF ME- BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE PSYCHOSIS ALSO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHICH PREVENTS THEM UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF CARE DELIVERY. IF WE HAD A BETTER HANDLE. ON THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WE'RE SERVING IT WOULD ALLOW US TO MORE STRATEGICALLY TARGET INVESTMENTS- TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BILL DIAGNOSIS THAT REFERRED TO SOMEONE WHO. HAD BOTH A DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. MORE RECENTLY WE THINK OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND SO. ATTENTION HAS LAGGED A BET ON THE NEEDS OF THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION. AND WE WOULD DO WE WOULD DO VERY WELL IF WE COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT SCALE OF NEED AND BE ABLE TO COMPARE THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING IN THE OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVING RELATIVE. TO THAT LEVEL OF NEED AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE'RE NOT IN THAT. POSITION AT THE MOMENT BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL FINALLY WE ARE ON ISSUE TEN OUR FINAL ISSUE FOR TODAY. WE DO HAVE THE SAME PANEL HAS NOW AND THIS. IS ON THE PROPOSED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE AXED FLECKS OF. TRAILER BILL. CAN PLEASE BE. SO- WE ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK THAT KELLY FIVE REPRESENTS THIS ITEM ON BEHALF THE PART. ON KELLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH HAVING ME TODAY. THANK YOU KNOW LAST YEAR ABA ONE WITH A ACTED BROWN GREAT BUT- TRUCK COUNTY. BACK TO THE MAKING REQUIRED. THE PUBLIC OFTEN. THANK YOU VERY AYE GOING NAY THEY WERE. PROPOSING SPEND MOST OF THOSE STRUCK BY NOT RETURN YEAR. I PLAYED. COUNTY SAID BACKGROUND THERE LOCALLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T. AS OPPOSED TO HAVE IT'S A NETWORK EACH YEAR FIVE RIGHT. BAND WITHIN THE. ANYONE TWENTY IF THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR SURPRISED HE CAN'T THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO CONNECTING YOU YORK LANDED A COVETED RELATED REASON CAN'T OPERATE BEACON STREET IMPROVEMENTS INTERPRET OR MAKE IT PERFECTLY EVERY TIME VERY QUICKLY BODIES ALL COUNTY LETTERS ARE EXTRACTIONS WITH ALLEGATIONS ONE POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO EXTEND FOR ANOTHER YEAR ON THE NET REVERSION DEADLINE.

FIND THAT WORD VERY IF AND CALL CAN YOU TO VERIFY YEARS AGO AND INBOX CARE THE RICH HERE TO. WE'VE ALREADY THAT YOU THINK ONE. OF THE MOST MOST I SPENT. BUDDY BRING OF ANY IT BASED ON PLAN THE FIRST THREE. WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT POLICY IS GOING HAVE BEEN MADE AND ON ABILITY TO SERVE WHICH ARE A HOBBY FOR HOW PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE. CLIENTS GET THEIR INTERNET SPEED ON THE DATA WE RECEIVE SHOULD BE WHERE WE GOT TO OVER EXPENDITURE AND YEAR NINETEEN OF POINT THREE BILLION. WE DO THAT THAT OF THAT IF THE TO A VERSION OF. THE GOOD FOR EIGHTY FIVE NOW WILL FULLY. A LOT OF CLEAR KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL WE GET THE DATA WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT MEANS COUNTIES WILL LOSE SIGNIFICANT MONEY BECAUSE EVEN IF COUNTIES REDUCE EXPENDITURES. BY 75% COPPINGER DOWN SHE JUST A QUARTER OF THE PAPER. SPENT DURING THE CAN DOWN. WE DON'T THINK THE BALLOT THAT GOING TO BE FOR EXPANDED. BEGAN GATHERING MY CAN WITH THE BEST FUNDS TO REVIEW. ONE FOUR. WE HEAR AGO AND WE HAVE THAT ACCOUNT THE VERY TURNED NINETY SEVEN. OF THOSE ON SO CAN. WE GOT MORE ACTUALLY ABOUT NOT EXTENDING THE ONE MORE YOU BECAUSE THING LOOKED AT THE FUNDING PLAN AND TO KEEP IN MIND REVERTED FIVE. DON'T YOU HAVE TO COUNTY MARC ALEX. EVEN AT. SOMEBODY REFERRED AND- THE TO GET THEM OUT ALLOCATION AND THOSE. HAVE FUNDS THAT ARE WE'RE WILL WITH THE DEMOCRATS. IN THE DITCH FOR FUNDING IS WERE FROM. COUNTY THAT GO OUT. I'M. AND THEN YOU GET OFF THE ABOUT STATUS OF THE AND SPENDING SAVE BANK CIRCLE AROUND THE BIG. STATED WE WE'RE GONNA BE CALLING UNDER. AND HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TO BE A- THANK YOU MISTER J. GET TO WHEN I'M OF THE HEALTHCARE- IT YOU KNOW IT ENTER OF THE IN YOUR- OF. COMMISSION APPROVAL OF COUNTY PLAN. YOU KNOW WHEN AB ONE FOR WAS. WHEN THERE'S- DECLARED THAT. FUND THAT WOULD ACCEPT TO RIVER WORD RIVER. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT LITTLE LESS THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE ANIMATION FANS IN THE BALANCE OF P. E. I. IN COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORT. AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME BECAUSE MANY COUNTIES HAD NOT THEN PURSUING UTILIZATION OF INNOVATION FUNDS. WE KEEP TRACK AND WE POST MONTHLY. A MONTHLY DASHBOARD ON THE NUMBER OF COUNTY INNOVATION PLANS THAT WE RECEIVED- THE LEVEL OF FINDING THE NAME OF THE PROJECT AND WE ALSO TRACK HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR THE COMMISSION TO. REVIEW AND COUNTY INNOVATION PLAN THIS FISCAL YEAR THAT'S AVERAGING THIRTY SIX DAYS AND WE START THE CLOCK EITHER WAY AND THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. APPROACH THE PLANT. OR YOU COUNTY BOARD TO HAD APPROACH IT WE START THE CLAW. FOLLOWING MANDATORY THIRTY DAY PUBLIC REVIEW A PUBLIC PRESENTATION ACCOUNTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FOR EACH COUNTY INNOVATION BUT I AM. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROCESS IS DIFFERENT FOR INNOVATION THEN FOR P. E. I. OR C. AS THAT OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EXPENDITURES BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED. TO GET STATE LEVEL APPROVAL AND SO THAT ADDITIONAL STAFF DOES FEEL LIKE A BURDEN. I'M I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO FACILITATE. MULTI COUNTY. INVESTMENTS IN SHARED INNOVATION SO WE HAVE EITHER PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON. SIX OR SEVEN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT ABOUT FORTY COUNTIES. ON IT SEVERAL WAYS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. STRENGTHENING FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. HANGING IN THE CRISIS MODEL I MENTION EARLIER- WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTIES TO STRENGTHEN THEIR EFFORTS USE INNOVATION FUNDS. TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND ETHNIC INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES. ARE EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK HAS BEEN LEVERAGING COUNTY INNOVATION FUND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE APPROVED SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A COUNTY INNOVATIONS. AND NINETY SEVEN POINT 6% OF COUNTY PLANS ARE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION I THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT PERHAPS THAT PERCENTAGE IS LITTLE TOO HIGH IT SUGGEST THAT MAYBE- THAT INNOVATION PLANS AREN'T AS EDGY AS THEY COULD BE IF WE WANT TO FUNDAMENTALLY. DISRUPT SOME OF THAT THE SERVICE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY THAT AREN'T WORKING AS EFFECTIVELY. AS THEY COULD BE- BUT WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE CHARGE THAT ARE PUT OUR SYSTEM IS SLOW AND CUMBERSOME WE DO AGREE. THAT IT IS AN ADDED STAFF THAT COUNTIES OFTEN ARE HESITANT. TO FACE. WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR BEHAVIOR IT IS NOT WHAT CAUSES DEPARTMENTS AT COUNTIES TO LOSE MONEY TO REVERSION AND IN FACT WE HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. RIGHT UP TO THE JUNE DEADLINE SO THAT. WE CAN REVIEW THOSE PLANS TO AVOID REVERSION IF NECESSARY. IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION ABOUT THE STATUS OF UNSPENT FUNDS BY COUNTIES WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ASK C. B. H. J. FOR CLARIFICATION AND THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR FIVE POINTS OUT- WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE- FISCAL REPORTING TO TELL US HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REVERSION. IF THAT PROVISION IN THE LAW IS NOT WAIVE IT IS NOT POTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR- IT DOES SOUND LIKE IT THEN THE NUMBERS WOULD NOT BE VERY HIGH. YEAH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE BECAUSE. THE REPORTING IT'S NOT YET AVAILABLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO OUT- THE COULD HAS IN THE- IF YOU RECOMMEND. THAT CURRENTLY FINDS THAT RIVER COME BACK TO THE STATE. AND ARE ULTIMATELY REDISTRIBUTED BACK TO COUNTY SO IN A- SORT OF YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD. I'M INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES MAY LOSE SOME MONEY- BUT ACROSS ALL OF THE COUNTY'S IMAGES THEY DOLLARS THAT RIVER DON'T LEAVE THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE SYSTEM. THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS IN GETTING THOSE DOLLARS REVERTED BACK TO THE COUNTIES BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE TO SPEED THAT UP. IN THE PAST THE COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED THAT IN THE INSTANCE WHERE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE THAT MUCH AS A REVENUES FOR THREE YEARS OR LONGER OR IN THE CASE OF SMALL COUNTIES FIVE YEARS OR LONGER. THERE'S SOME JUSTIFICATION THERE TO. REDIRECT THOSE DOLLARS TO PRIORITIES AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO. EXPLORE THEIR ABILITY O RETAIN THOSE DOLLARS. UNDER CONDITIONS THAT THEY DEDICATE THEM TO STATEWIDE PRIORITIES LIKE ADDRESSING INEQUITIES WHICH WE KNOW ARE- FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES. THAT WE MUST DO BETTER ON. CAPITA AGAINST ANY QUESTIONS THAT BE THAT I MEAN ADDRESS. IN MY FORMAL TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM S. K. ARDA. HERE IN AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION BY JUST SAYING THAT I THINK- DR PIPER ANSWERED IT PERFECTLY. WE REALLY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF FUN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FEW PLACES. WHERE CALVET NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED SOME EXPENDITURES SO SHE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT COUNTIES ARE SPENDING MITCHELL SAY DOLLARS WE TYPICALLY DO WE SPEND 80% OF OUR IMAGE AS A DOLLARS IN TWO YEARS. WE HAVE WE HAVEFOR LARGE COUNTY THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS FOR SMALL COUNTIES FIVE YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS AND WE DO DO THAT WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. SO DOCTOR PAPERS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT THE AMOUNT THAT UNSPENT IS IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR SAFEGUARDING REVERSION OF A LARGE AMOUNT BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY ISOLATED PROJECT. REALLY JUST A HANDFUL OF PROJECTS. THAT HAVE COME TO US AND SAID BECAUSE THE POPE AT NINETEEN WE COULDN'T OPEN A WELLNESS CENTER SO WE COULDN'T EXPAND. THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE OF HOPE IN NINETEEN WHERE WE PLANNED TO TRAIN FIVE THOUSAND PRIMARILY VETERANS. TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID WE WERE GOING TO START IN OCTOBER. BUT I'M SORRY WE'RE GONNA STARTING JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE COULDN'T WE HAD IT BACK. TO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THESE FUNDS WILL BE WILL BE SUBJECT TO REVERSION SO WE'RE LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF PROJECTS. LOOK LIKELY NOT MORE THAN TEN PROJECTS OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND THAT ARE OUT THERE SO WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF PROJECTS HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL NUMBER- OF. INTER AND THAT IS TRUE FOR THE INNOVATION SIDE TOO BECAUSE THAT'S HOW BE A SAID THEY'VE DONE. WHAT THEY NEED TO D TO SUPPORT BOTH COUNTIES THAT ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO DO TO GO THROUGH THAT ADDITIONAL. THAT HE DESCRIBED. FOR THOSE THAT ARE TO THAT BUT HAD. WHILE THEY'RE GIVING- BUT NOW. TO DO THAT THEY'RE BRINGING THE PROJECT AND WE GIVE THAT THE- ALWAYS SEE THE COMMISSION IS THAT IT. TO MORE SESSIONS IN JUNE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. IT'S FOR THOSE THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAFEGUARDING OF REVERSION FRONTS FOR THE INNOVATION POT. REALLY IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT THE U. COUNTIES THAT HAVEN'T HAD THE CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THAT ADDITIONAL STEP. SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT INNOVATION PROJECT WHICH CAN TAKE SOME TIME. RIGHT NOW THE- THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE STILL AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. IN IN THIS PROCESS TRANSCONTINENTAL'S ARE FINANCE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THE CD HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE THAT INNOVATION PROJECTS. WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS. AND CONTINUE TO HOPE THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES GET RESOLVED SOME OF THE ISSUES AND EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IT'S EVEN FOR THOSE FOLKS. THAT ARE GOING TO BE HEARD IN JUNE. IF COMMISSION COMMIT OR THE CAN. DOES NOT APPROVE. THE PROJECT IF THEY DISAPPROVE THE PROJECT. AND THERE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REVERSION IN THOSE PROJECTS. THEY WILL HAVE NO TIME. TO RETURN BACK AND SAFEGUARD THOSE FUNDS THOSE FUNDS WILL BE REVERTED EVEN THOUGH THEY DID ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD TO DO. BUT IN THE END THE COMMISSION DID NOT APPROVE THEIR PROJECT. THOSE ARE THE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SO AGAIN YOU KNOW I THINK THE QUESTION NUMBER THREE IS. HOW MUCH TIME IS THAT THEY FUNDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT VERY VERY LITTLE. WE ARE REALLY ONLY LOOKING FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. IN BOTH THE INNOVATION POT AS WELL AS- FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED IN CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN READY TO BE SPENT. BUT JUST COULDN'T BE SPENT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE TIRES TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I WILL SAY IT'S QUITE ENCOURAGING TO. RECEIVE THE INFORMATION FROM BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS C. B. H. T. A. ABOUT. THE SPENDING OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND WILL SAY. PARDON THE PUN BUT IT'S AWFULLY INNOVATIVE TO DO MULTI COUNTY INVESTMENTS AND SHARED INNOVATION AND- REALLY I'M APPRECIATIVE OF TOKYO AND FOR SHARING. WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH THIS ENTIRE PANEL AND ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN TODAY'S HEARING. WE WILL NOW BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT AS A REMINDER WE WELCOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON ANY ISSUE ON THE AGENDA INCLUDING THE NON PRESENTATION ISSUES WHICH ARE NUMBERS ELEVEN THROUGH NINETEEN. WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND AS A REMINDER THE PHONE NUMBER TO CONNECT IS ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE. AND SHOULD BE ON THE SCREEN IF YOU ARE WATCHING OVER THE INTERNET THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. PUBLIC ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS PLEASE CONTACT THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. AT 916-319-2090 NINE AND A STAFF MEMBER WILL ASSIST YOU. OPERATOR WE ARE READY TO BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT. Q. IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT THIRTY IN Q. WE'LL GO TO LINE THIRTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. SEARCH THANK YOU MISTER TURNER MEMBERS TEN THAT AND I HAVE COMMENTS FOR TWO CLIENTS ON TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT I'LL TALK AS CONCISELY AS POSSIBLE. THE FIRST COMMENT IS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS MERGING PHYSICIANS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AS PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MARSH THAT. AS WELL AS IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY WORDS YOU PHYSICIAN SEE AND TREAT MANY PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS CARE IN OTHER SETTINGS FOR VARIETY REASONS. THEY COULD BE MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS PATIENTS WITH POSTOPERATIVE DISCHARGE DETERIORATION. CATIONS CAN'T GET FOLLOW UP ORTHOPEDIC APPOINTMENTS AS EXAMPLES- TREATMENT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS AN EMERGENCY BY THE TIME THE PATIENT PRESENTS BUT IS NOT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FROM THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY STANDPOINT. BY LIMITING THE OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY TO ONLY EXAMINING COST TARGETS BY SECTOR OR REGION FOR PROVIDERS WERE MISSING A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY FOR CONSUMERS. THE OFFICE OF PORTABILITY SHOULD ALSO BE DESIGNED TO LOOK AT DELIVERY OF SERVICES ARE TARGETS BY SECTOR ARE ONE WAY TO LOOK AT EXPENSES BUT IT'S SIMPLY COMPARES COSTS OF ONE PROVIDER TO A SIMILAR PROVIDER. IT MISSES WHETHER THE PROVIDER IS EVEN THE RIGHT OR MOST COST EFFECTIVE PLACE FOR THAT SERVICE A CARE TO BE DELIVERED AND WHETHER THE PATIENT HAD AN EARLIER OR MORE COST EFFECTIVE OPTION. THE OFFICE PORTABILITY PASS SHOULD INCLUDE COLLECTING DATA TO EXAMINE A REPORT ON THE SYSTEM TRENDS GAPS IN DELIVERY AND SYSTEM WIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY NOT SIMPLY HOW MUCH YOU SECTOR COSTS. WE WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE OF MIND AT THE TRAILER LOOKS LANGUAGE JUST PRO DEVELOPED OR IS AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPED. THE SECOND ISSUE I'M CALLING ON IS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY ITEM THREE FROSTED RECAST MODERNIZATION INCLUDED TRAVELING WAS TO EXPAND THE OUTCOME REPORTING FOR CARDIAC PROCEDURES. CURRENTLY HOSPITALS AND CARDIAC SURGEONS ARE% REQUIRED TO REPORT OUTCOMES FOR CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERIES. THE NEW ARE STRUGGLING WHICH WOULD EXPAND REQUIRED REPORT. TO ANY CARDIAC CHRISSY. THIS IT I THINK. MOVE GOING FROM ONE PERSON REQUIRED PEOPLE. TO AN UNLIMITED NUMBER ACT INITIAL REVIEW WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE EXPANSION TO REQUIRE REPORTING. FOR ANY CARDIAC PROCEDURES IN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN AVAILABILITY OF THOSE CARDIAC PROCEDURES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING IN MORE DETAIL WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE AN ARCH BED ARE MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT TWENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THIS IS NO EASY TASK IN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY OUTLINED IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL NEED SEVERAL CHANGES IF IT IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE. AS PROPOSED THERE COULD BE SEVERAL DETRIMENTAL AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE BILL SUGGESTS THAT HEALTHCARE SPENDING THAT EXISTS TODAY IS IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT IN IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO. BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE CO THAT HAS SHOWN CURRENT SPENDING ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. IN FACT THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION POSITION AS WELL SEEN IN THEIR PROPOSAL TO INVEST MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS SOME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS WOULD ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED IF OTHERS SPENDING IS REDUCED. FOURTEEN A CHOICE BETWEEN NEW BENEFICIAL SPENDING AND CUTS TO EXISTING SERVICES. C. H.

ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. FOR YEARS ARE UNION MEMBERS WORK ON WAGE INCREASES IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO MAINTAIN THEIR AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH COVERAGE. WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES AND MANY OF OUR BARGAINING DISPUTES WITH EMPLOYERS ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYERS TRYING TO SHIFT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE ON TO WORKERS. SO WE BELIEVE BY IMPLEMENTING A MECHANISM THAT WOULD CURTAIL THE RISING COST OF CARE. AND SHARING THE COST SAVINGS WITH THE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM WE BELIEVE THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE WOULD RESULT IN MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL RELIEF TO TAX PAYERS EMPLOYERS AND OUR MEMBERS. WITH LOWER PREMIUMS OUT OF POCKET COSTS THE STATE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PAY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS WITH SOMETHING BUT THE OFFENSE IN THE COMMITTEE AND STRENGTHENING LANGUAGE. AND RESPECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE OFFICER TO JOT THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE GET. OR ITS APPROACHES AS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE.

THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY AT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING THIS IS HILLARY THE CAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON BOTH THE PROPOSAL TO RECAP AND MODERNIZE OUR POSH AND NOT AT THE OFFICE HEALTHCARE PORTABILITY THE FIRST KEY CONCERN THE PM I WOULD LIKE TO RATES REGARDING OFSTED PROPOSAL IS THE MAKE UP OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL. DESPITE THE FACT THATTHE COUNCIL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY OVER SUCH KEY CONSIDERATIONS AS GENERAL PHYSICIAN EDUCATION THAT THE CLIENT BY PERCY OF THE POSITION WORKFORCE THE PLACEMENT OF PROVIDERS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAM. UNLIKE THE COMMISSION IT REPLACES THERE ARE NO DESIGNATED SEATS ON THE COUNCIL PROFICIENT THIS LACK OF DIRECT ENGAGEMENT WITH PROVIDERS OVERSIGHT AND SAM I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALTERATIONS THE PROPOSAL. THAT FOCUSED ON THAT ISSUE. MUCH OF THE DATA PERMIC STATUTES THE HOW PROGRAM ART RUN HAVE BEEN. IN THE- LEAVING SUCH OP. UP TO A REGULATORY PROCESS ONLY MINIMAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SAM I WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING A REQUIREMENT FOR AN ANNUAL REPORT AT A MINIMUM COVERS OFF THE ANNUAL ALLOCATIONS TO PROGRAM MYSELF YET. IT'S WHAT ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE NEWLY PASSED THE PARLIAMENT. A FINAL ISSUE THAT I AM I WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN THE HOSPITAL CALLED BALL IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE WORKFORCE SURVEY WITH NEW QUESTIONS. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT PROVIDERS MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE ANSWERING SOME OF THE NEWLY ADDED QUESTIONS AND MAY CHOOSE INSTEAD TO SIMPLY NOT RESPOND AT ALL. LIMITING THE ACCURACY OF CRITICAL DATA REGARDING ACCESS AND POSITION AVAILABILITY. FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE NEW SURVEY AND WHY THE EXISTING SURVEY STRUCTURE IT'S ADEQUATE ISN'T IT. AFTER THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY PMI IS SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO CURB COSTS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INCREASED COMPETITION REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY AND INCREASE CARE COORDINATION. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THANK YOU CHANGES PRIOR TO ENACTMENT. OF THE AMENDMENT BILL AMENDMENTS ARE BEING DISCUSSED THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF PROVIDER IN THE PROPOSAL IS OVERLY BROAD. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGES THAT NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF PROVIDER TO ONLY FOCUS. ON THE REAL COST DRIVERS IN THE- THAT IS SHOW THAT HELP COSTS HELLO. R. J. BY POLICY IN THE MY- TO MOSCOW. COMPONENT OF WHICH ARE THE HIGH AND MARKET I'M HOT MARC. APPLYING ARE IN THE PHYSICIAN PRACTICE COULD REFER IN SMALLER. BEING GOBBLED UP BY OTHER EXACERBATING THE CONSOLIDATION. STUDIES SHOW THAT ONE HOSPITAL ACQUIRED PHYSICIAN PRACTICES COST INCREASE. ADDITIONALLY THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL OF WHO IS TASKED WITH MAKING HOT CROSS TARGET DECISION MATTERS. IT'S CRITICAL DECISION SHOULD BE TAPPED TO A STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIALS SUCH AS THE GOVERNOR OR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE OFTEN LOST WHEN THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS ARE LEFT IN THE HANDS. OF AN APPOINTED OFFICIAL. YEAH MAY ALSO WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO BUT- AT THE PROPOSAL HE ALSO CLAIMS DATABASE NEEDS BE UP AND RUNNING BEFORE THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER SETTING CAR PARK THAT. TO ATTEMPT PROCESS BEFORE SUFFICIENT ACCURATE DATA IS AVAILABLE IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. FINALLY CMA WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES IN THE POLICY PROCESS. RATHER THAN THE BUDGET PROCESS. HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR WHAT IS ALREADY CARRYING AB ELEVEN THIRTY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE PORTABILITY CAN'T REALLY MOVE FORWARD BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO RUSH THE FOR THE BUDGET WITH LESS OVERSIGHT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THE MULTIPLE POLICY PROCESS AND- IN CLOSING THEME WOULD LIKE TO LET JUST TO CONSIDER THE BILL UP ALL THE- BEING OFFERED AND HEALTH SPACE. WHEN DETERMINING OF STRATEGY FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS. HOW THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS. OFFICE ABOUT- AIRPORT. THE RECAPPING POSH THAT AND NOT EVEN CONSIDERING THE NOW DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDIC HOW ARE AT. WORK REPRESENTS A GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE HARD WORK AND LIKELY TEMPORARY OF PEOPLE A PART OF THE- BUT WHAT. SHOULD NOT ONLY THE BAND WITH BUT THE HEART OF THE DEPARTMENT WHICH SEEMS LIKE THEY WOULD BE STRETCHED BY SO MANY SWEEPING PROPOSAL. BUT THAT OF PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH SO MUCH CHANGE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ALL AT ONCE. WHILE MOST ARE STILL ATTEMPTING TO ATTRACT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. EMA URGES A MEASURED APPROACH CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE CAPACITIES OF THE STATE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. ABOUT THE DATING ALL THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
