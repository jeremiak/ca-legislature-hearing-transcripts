BE A BUSY ONE AND. TODAY WILL

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:19.631 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST LOOK AT

00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:21.767 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION FOLLOWING

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:23.202 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. TORRENTIAL WILDFIRE

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:25.037 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:26.605 region:rollup2
A BUT WE WILL ALSO THIS SESSION

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:28.040 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING INTO A FEW OTHER

00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:29.741 region:rollup2
THINGS INCLUDING.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.809 region:rollup2
FLOOD PREVENTION INFRASTRUCTURE

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:32.344 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF THE EVENTS AT ORACLE

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.845 region:rollup2
DAM LAST YEAR.

00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:35.113 region:rollup2
REVISITING TOXIC CLEAN UP

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:37.649 region:rollup2
EFFORTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:38.717 region:rollup2
TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL AND IN

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:40.852 region:rollup2

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:44.223 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN THAT COMMUNITY.

00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:45.624 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ACCESS TO

00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:47.559 region:rollup2
CLEAN WATER AND QUITE POSSIBLY

00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:49.094 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE STATE OF OUR SNOW PACK

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.596 region:rollup2
AND RECORD LOW RAINFALL

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:51.997 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY DROUGHT RESPONSE TO

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:54.933 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT.

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:56.001 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLIES.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.202 region:rollup2
WE'LL LOOK AT SKYROCKETING

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:58.837 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OF WHALE ENTANGLEMENTS

00:28:57.202 --> 00:29:00.472 region:rollup2
ALONG OUR COAST AND HOW WE CAN

00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:02.507 region:rollup2
IMPROVE. RESPONSE AS WELL AS

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:03.041 region:rollup2
DEVELOP PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:05.477 region:rollup2
ALLOW OUR CRAB FISHERY TO

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:07.312 region:rollup2
THRIVE.

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:08.380 region:rollup2
AND SO I WILL TAKE A LOOK A

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:10.716 region:rollup2
PROTECTING AN IMPROVING THE

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.717 region:rollup2
HABITAT FOR ASSEMBLY THAT I

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.417 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:14.019 region:rollup2
TOO LONG.

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:16.255 region:rollup2
ARE A STEEL HEAD AND SALMON

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:17.990 region:rollup2
FISHERIES AS WE HEAD INTO THIS

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:18.523 region:rollup2
YEAR ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.592 region:rollup2
STEEL HAD POPULATION MOST

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.792 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.027 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:23.262 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK OF SOUTHERN

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:25.230 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT THERE IS A

00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:27.566 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STILL HAD

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.768 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT POPULATION IS IN

00:29:27.566 --> 00:29:31.503 region:rollup2
PERIL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:33.839 region:rollup2
AREAS SUCH OF THE AS THE FEATHER

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:36.308 region:rollup2
RIVER. ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:38.143 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THREATS ALL DUE TO LONG

00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:40.946 region:rollup2
TERM DAMAGES TO OUR RIVER

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:43.015 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEMS AND FINALLY WE WILL

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:44.249 region:rollup2
ALSO TAKE A LOOK INTO AGAIN. AT

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:47.386 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVING OUR RECYCLING

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:49.354 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHICH IN ITSELF FRANKLY

00:29:47.386 --> 00:29:52.557 region:rollup2
A SEEMINGLY ANNUAL EXERCISE IN

NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHAT

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:06.972 region:rollup2
A CHANGE TO A PROGRAM THAT I

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:07.172 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.173 region:rollup2
KNOWS.

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.174 region:rollup2
IS

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.808 region:rollup2
SLOWLY GOING DOWN SO I'M VERY

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:10.475 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC THAT WILL ACTUALLY

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.776 region:rollup2
MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT ISSUE

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR.

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:12.878 region:rollup2
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE MAJOR

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.579 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL BE

WE HAVE REPEATEDLY I'D LIKE TO

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:38.904 region:rollup2
START BY READING A QUOTE FROM.

00:30:36.268 --> 00:30:41.073 region:rollup2
A HEARING THIS COMMITTEE HAD. A

00:30:38.904 --> 00:30:43.442 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO ON APRIL EIGHTH

00:30:41.073 --> 00:30:45.043 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THE QUOTAS

00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:47.479 region:rollup2
ARE CLIMATE CHANGE OUR CLIMATE

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:47.946 region:rollup2
IS CHANGING AND THIS POSES A

00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:50.849 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:51.850 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:53.752 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY OUR WAY OF LIFE

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.353 region:rollup2
OF COURSE HOW QUICKLY AND

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:56.888 region:rollup2
SEVERELY THIS THREAD IMPACTS US

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.589 region:rollup2
LARGELY DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:59.157 region:rollup2
AND AGGRESSIVELY WE MEET THE

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:00.926 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:03.228 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:05.664 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN GHG

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:06.865 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS WILL BE NECESSARY TO

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:08.633 region:rollup2
AVOID THE WORST CONSEQUENCES OF

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:10.535 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:12.537 region:rollup2
MITIGATION EFFORTS WILL TOUCH

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:14.272 region:rollup2
NEARLY EVERY ASPECT

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:16.742 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:18.410 region:rollup2
PLANNING AND INVESTMENT.

00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:20.245 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MY OPENING STATEMENT TO

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.080 region:rollup2
THAT HEARING BACK IN TWENTY

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:24.282 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WHICH FOCUSED

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.717 region:rollup2
PRESCIENTLY AT THAT TIME ON ARE

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:27.419 region:rollup2
CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS.

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.887 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN THE WESTERN

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:30.622 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:31.923 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.925 region:rollup2
THE HEARING FOLLOWED A NASA

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:35.594 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT WAS RELEASED JUST A

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:37.162 region:rollup2
FEW MONTHS EARLIER AND THAT

00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:39.631 region:rollup2
PREDICTED EXTREME WEATHER

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:41.233 region:rollup2
PATTERNS AND CAUTIONED THAT

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.902 region:rollup2
EXTREME DROUGHT FOR THE REGION

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:46.204 region:rollup2
IN THE. DECADES AHEAD WOULD

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:48.140 region:rollup2
BECOME THE NORM.

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:50.409 region:rollup2
AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT NOW

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.410 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR GAVE US AN ABUNDANCE

00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:53.945 region:rollup2
OF SNOW IN WHAT FELT LIKE A

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.647 region:rollup2
REPLENISHMENT. OF OUR WATER

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:57.382 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES.

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:58.683 region:rollup2
BUT AS WE SIT HERE ON FEBRUARY

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:00.685 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIRST

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:03.655 region:rollup2
WE ARE AGAIN EXPERIENCING RECORD

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:05.757 region:rollup2
LOW SNOWPACK AND RAINFALL. AND

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:08.093 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEFT CONTEMPLATING ANOTHER

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:09.828 region:rollup2
LONG DROUGHT PERIOD JUST AS NASA

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:12.097 region:rollup2
PROTECTED THOUGH SEVERAL YEARS

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:13.465 region:rollup2
AGO. AND IN THAT APRIL EIGHTH

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:16.001 region:rollup2
HEARING WE ALSO LEARNED OF

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:17.436 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS BY LAWRENCE BERKELEY

00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:19.571 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LABORATORY.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:21.807 region:rollup2
THAT'S NO WATER IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:23.542 region:rollup2
WILL DECLINE BY SIXTEEN PERCENT

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:25.410 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:27.746 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT BY TWENTY

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.181 region:rollup2
SEVENTY. AND AN ASTOUNDING FORTY

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.816 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT BY THE END OF THE

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.318 region:rollup2
CENTURY.

00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:35.220 region:rollup2
FORTY ONE PERCENT FOLKS.

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:36.888 region:rollup2
THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.191 region:rollup2
RIVERS THE HEART OF OUR WATER

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:41.126 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEM COULD SEE ATTEND

00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:43.862 region:rollup2
A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE AND

00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:44.663 region:rollup2
WATER FLOWS BY TWENTY SEVENTY IN

00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:47.599 region:rollup2
THE MONTHS FROM DECEMBER TO

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:49.100 region:rollup2
MARCH. AS RAINFALL. REPLACES

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:51.036 region:rollup2
SNOWFALL.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.939 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT THERE COULD BE A

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:55.841 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE IN WATER

00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:57.242 region:rollup2
FLOWS FROM APRIL TO JULY. AS

00:32:55.841 --> 00:32:58.577 region:rollup2
THERE WILL NO LONGER BE SNOWPACK

00:32:57.242 --> 00:33:00.846 region:rollup2
MELTING TO PROVIDE WATER IN THE

00:32:58.577 --> 00:33:02.581 region:rollup2
SUMMER MONTHS.

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:04.316 region:rollup2
WEATHER MODELING SHOWN AT THAT

00:33:02.581 --> 00:33:05.817 region:rollup2
TIME DETAILED THIS TO BE THE

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:07.586 region:rollup2
SAME FOR MANY OTHER RIVER

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:09.354 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE PACIFIC

00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:10.488 region:rollup2
NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST.

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:12.657 region:rollup2
WELL TODAY WE'RE GOING TO GET AN

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:14.226 region:rollup2
UPDATE ON THIS MODELING FROM ARE

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:15.927 region:rollup2
VERY TROUBLING MOTLEY FROM OUR

00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:16.995 region:rollup2
CLIMATE EXPERTS.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:18.530 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION HEARING TODAY

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:20.332 region:rollup2
WILL FOCUS

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.734 region:rollup2
ON THE WILDFIRES IN TWENTY

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:24.069 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AS WELL THE RECOVERY

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:26.238 region:rollup2
WHERE EFFORTS THAT ARE NOW

00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:28.473 region:rollup2
UNDERWAY AND WHAT THIS ALL MEANS

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:30.141 region:rollup2
FOR OUR FUTURE.

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:32.444 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RECORD

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:34.980 region:rollup2
BREAKING FIRES AN UNUSUALLY LONG

00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:37.315 region:rollup2
FIRE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR AND THE

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.783 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE FOR SOMETIME NOW.

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:40.519 region:rollup2
IN FACT EIGHT OF THE STATE'S

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:42.954 region:rollup2
MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:44.923 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:47.626 region:rollup2
THE FIRES LAST YEAR BURNED INTO

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:49.661 region:rollup2
DECEMBER WHICH IS HISTORICALLY

00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:52.063 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF OUR FIRE SEASON.

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:53.765 region:rollup2
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THE EXTREME

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:55.767 region:rollup2
AND CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS

TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE SEE TODAY.

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:58.676 region:rollup2

00:56:51.575 --> 00:56:54.645 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE.

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:56.847 region:rollup2
WATERSHED LANDS ENFORCED IT

00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:59.283 region:rollup2
LANDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNDER

00:56:56.847 --> 00:57:00.951 region:rollup2
FEDERAL OWNERSHIP.

00:56:59.283 --> 00:57:03.553 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY KEY BUT THE

00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:05.589 region:rollup2
SAME TIME INVESTING IN THESE

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:06.990 region:rollup2
OTHER ELEMENTS IT'S BEFORE THE

00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:08.492 region:rollup2
FIRE OCCURS AND AS YOU'LL HEAR

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.326 region:rollup2
MORE DETAIL WHAT GOES ON AFTER

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:11.228 region:rollup2
THE FIRE.

00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:12.296 region:rollup2
OCCURS.

00:57:11.228 --> 00:57:13.897 region:rollup2
BUT I WANNA SPEND THE REST OF MY

00:57:12.296 --> 00:57:14.531 region:rollup2
TIME REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT ARE

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:16.300 region:rollup2
WE DOING.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.934 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.536 region:rollup2
THE FIRE OCCURS AND THAT HAS TO

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:20.504 region:rollup2
DO WITH ALL THE THINGS RELATIVE

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:22.339 region:rollup2
TO FORCED HEALTH FOREST

00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:23.540 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:25.042 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION ALL OF THOSE

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.510 region:rollup2
EFFORTS

00:57:25.042 --> 00:57:27.311 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNOR

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.812 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:30.314 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:32.115 region:rollup2
INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS

00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:33.517 region:rollup2
REDUCTION FUNDING IN OVER TWO

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:35.319 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:36.119 region:rollup2
IN FOREST HEALTH. ARE IN THE

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:37.754 region:rollup2
CURRENT BUDGET.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.856 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FOR

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:41.625 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION FUELS TREATMENT

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:43.226 region:rollup2
MOSTLY GOING OUT TO.

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:44.328 region:rollup2
MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:45.796 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN REAL

00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:46.863 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:49.333 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND.

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:50.133 region:rollup2
TOOK TO REDUCE FUEL LOADING THE

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.803 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:54.137 region:rollup2
FOREST AT RESILIENCE.

00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:55.539 region:rollup2
AND THEN AGAIN A HUNDRED AND

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.673 region:rollup2
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. THE

00:57:55.539 --> 00:57:58.375 region:rollup2
CURRENT THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:59.276 region:rollup2
AT TO GO FORWARD WITH THOSE VERY

00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:00.911 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR.

00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:02.112 region:rollup2
EFFORTS.

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:03.347 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:05.515 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:06.783 region:rollup2
TO GET OUR FORESTS BACK

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:08.418 region:rollup2
TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE TO BE

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:11.421 region:rollup2
MORE RESILIENT.

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:12.789 region:rollup2
I NOT HAVE THESE STAND REPLACING

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:15.058 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:16.727 region:rollup2
ACRE RIM FIRES THAT ARE GOING TO

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:18.161 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO OCCUR. TREE

00:58:16.727 --> 00:58:20.063 region:rollup2
MORTALITY THAT'S YOU KNOW NOW

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.764 region:rollup2
CONSUMED O. OVER ALMOST A

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.466 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

00:58:20.764 --> 00:58:23.500 region:rollup2
TREES.

00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:25.836 region:rollup2
IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.038 region:rollup2
SIERRA THAT HAVE SUCCUMBED.

00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:30.173 region:rollup2
TO AN EPIDEMIC LEVEL OF OF.

00:58:28.038 --> 00:58:32.376 region:rollup2
BARK BEETLE ACTIVITY AND

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:33.944 region:rollup2
MORTALITY AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:34.611 region:rollup2
AS WE TREND BACK INTO DRY

00:58:33.944 --> 00:58:36.046 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:37.881 region:rollup2
IT PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL

00:58:36.046 --> 00:58:39.449 region:rollup2
AND SOUTHERN SIERRA WE WILL ONLY

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:42.552 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SEE.

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:44.955 region:rollup2
THE SPREAD OF OF INTENSE LEVELS

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:46.123 region:rollup2
OF BARK BEETLE ó INCREASE AS

00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:48.158 region:rollup2
IT WORKS ITS WAY TOWARDS A LAKE

00:58:46.123 --> 00:58:50.293 region:rollup2
TAHOE BASIN AND FURTHER NORTH I

00:58:48.158 --> 00:58:52.963 region:rollup2
INTO THE. THE SIERRA THE KEY

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:54.197 region:rollup2
HERE IS INVESTING USING ALL THE

00:58:52.963 --> 00:58:55.832 region:rollup2
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX.

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:57.334 region:rollup2
I KNOW LATER ON THIS MORNING.

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:58.769 region:rollup2
.

00:58:57.334 --> 00:59:00.303 region:rollup2
CHAIR NOVEL WILL TALK ABOUT THE

00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:01.371 region:rollup2
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.973 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT HAS BEEN AN

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:04.908 region:rollup2
AMAZING JOB.

00:59:02.973 --> 00:59:06.443 region:rollup2
FROM AN EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:08.812 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

00:59:06.443 --> 00:59:10.914 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE FACES AND REALLY.

00:59:08.812 --> 00:59:12.949 region:rollup2
UP PROVIDED THAT DISCUSSION

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:14.217 region:rollup2
POINT AS TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:16.019 region:rollup2
GOING IN THAT'S INVESTING.

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:20.157 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE INSECTS BEFORE THE

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:22.726 region:rollup2
FIRE. OCCURS SO WE CAN REDUCE.

00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:25.228 region:rollup2
THE VOLUME OF FUEL BEEN OUR

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:27.264 region:rollup2
FORCE WE CAN CREATE. A HEALTHY

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:28.832 region:rollup2
RESILIENT FORCIBLE WAS STAND.

00:59:27.264 --> 00:59:30.734 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF FIRES THAT'S A

00:59:28.832 --> 00:59:32.469 region:rollup2
MORE NATURAL COMPONENT TO THE

00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:33.904 region:rollup2
FORCE THE CHALLENGES IS.

00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:35.072 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN PEOPLE ARE

00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:36.473 region:rollup2
LIVING IN THESE URBAN INTERFACE

00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:37.974 region:rollup2
AREA SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR

00:59:36.473 --> 00:59:40.010 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION.

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:41.044 region:rollup2
AND FUELS TREATMENT IN AROUND

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.879 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:44.381 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR USE OF FIRE OR OTHER

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:46.683 region:rollup2
TOOLS WITH WHAT WE CAN DO IN

00:59:44.381 --> 00:59:48.952 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS. OF THE STATE WHERE

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:51.188 region:rollup2
FIRE CAN BE USED MORE READILY.

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:52.989 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE FUEL LOADING BUT IT'S

00:59:51.188 --> 00:59:55.225 region:rollup2
A TEAM EFFORT AND IT'S

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.827 region:rollup2
INCREASING BY. NO DOUBT THAT THE

00:59:55.225 --> 00:59:57.961 region:rollup2
PACE AND SCALE BY WHICH WERE

00:59:56.827 --> 00:59:59.696 region:rollup2
USING.

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.764 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED FIRE.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.699 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:05.469 region:rollup2
PACE AND SCALE OF OUR PUBLIC

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:07.337 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AT WORK TO ENSURE?

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:09.873 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT WE ARE RELENTLESS IN

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:11.374 region:rollup2
EDUCATING OUR POPULATION.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:13.009 region:rollup2
MANY WHO MOVED TO THESE WILD

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:15.312 region:rollup2
PLANTS WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.847 region:rollup2
OF THE THE RISKS THAT THEY'RE IN

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:18.882 region:rollup2
OUR HOW TO INTERACT IN THE WILD

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:26.456 region:rollup2
ABOUT NINE MILLION ACRES OF THE

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:28.358 region:rollup2
FOREST LAND IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:30.794 region:rollup2

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:34.631 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THEM WERE ABOUT FIFTY

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:35.165 region:rollup2
ACRES WORK FIFTY TO A HUNDRED

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.900 region:rollup2

THE INCENTIVES WORKING THROUGH.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:44.508 region:rollup2
VARIOUS TOOLS TO ENGAGE OUR

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:46.576 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS IN TREATING THESE

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:48.845 region:rollup2
LANDS BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY. NINE

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:50.447 region:rollup2
MILLION ACRES TREATED MEANS NINE

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:51.848 region:rollup2
MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:53.383 region:rollup2
THAT'S MORE RESILIENT. THAT'S

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:55.352 region:rollup2
NOT CONTRIBUTING TO CARBON

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:57.654 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION. THAT'S NOT

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:59.055 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING TO DEVASTATING GOT

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:01.057 region:rollup2

WILDLIFE ALL ASPECTS THAT GO

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:09.666 region:rollup2
WITH THAT AND THESE THESE ARE

FAMILY LAND OWNERS WHO.

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2
JUST NEED THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:18.041 region:rollup2
TO AT AND SOME TECHNICAL ADVICE

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:18.942 region:rollup2
TO HELP MANAGE THEIR LAND. THEN

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.443 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THERE IS THERE'S

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:22.145 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BY OUR COMMERCIAL

LANDOWNERS AND THERE'S THE

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:26.182 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAND OF THAT MAKES UP SO

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:27.450 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE FOREST LAND. ALL HAS

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.085 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE TOGETHER.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.654 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.156 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THESE LANDSCAPE LEVEL

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:34.524 region:rollup2
PROJECTS AS WE GO FORWARD SO WE

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.926 region:rollup2
CAN GET SOME REAL WORK.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.893 region:rollup2
DOWN ON THE GROUND WE CAN MAKE A

01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:38.495 region:rollup2
REAL DIFFERENCE WE GOT TO

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.796 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE EVERY.

TOOL WE HAVE IN THE TOOLBOX

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.899 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IT'S NOT CAL FIRE

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:43.867 region:rollup2
WORKING BY ITSELF.

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.036 region:rollup2

IT REALLY PIVOTING OUR

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:14.831 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS AT THE TREE

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:17.167 region:rollup2

LAND IN THE STATE.

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:31.701 region:rollup2
IT'S MOSTLY WITHIN FEDERAL

OWNERSHIP AND IT'S MOSTLY.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:36.206 region:rollup2
WITHIN PRIVATE OWNERSHIP EITHER

THE WORK DONE THROUGH INCENTIVES

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.198 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH TECHNICAL ADVICE.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.300 region:rollup2
THROUGH COLLABORATION.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:06.169 region:rollup2
WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS THE

HELP BRING.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:12.709 region:rollup2
BAD LANDOWNER SYSTEMS AND

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:14.177 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LANDOWNERS SINCE IT'S

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:15.712 region:rollup2
MONEY OUT TO THE TABLE.

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:16.579 region:rollup2
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:18.748 region:rollup2
REGULATING.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.049 region:rollup2
THE THE FORCE PRACTICES IN THE

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.617 region:rollup2
STATE'S A HARVESTING TIMBER

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:22.852 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALLY OFF OF PRIVATE

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
LAND.

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:26.356 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW REQUIRES A A

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.223 region:rollup2
TIMBER HARVEST PLAN AND BE OVER

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:30.660 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PROCESS THERE SO

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:31.461 region:rollup2
WE'RE CERTAINLY ENGAGED. IN THE

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.495 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ASPECT BUT IT'S MUCH.

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.531 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT THE

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.732 region:rollup2
REAL RESPONSIBILITY IS OUT THERE

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:37.066 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE WHAT ARE THE

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:39.469 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES HOW DO WE HELP

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:41.004 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS. HELP THEMSELVES.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.539 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE.

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:44.274 region:rollup2
WORKING DOING FUELS TREATMENT

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:47.110 region:rollup2
ENGAGING IN THE WOODS.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:49.946 region:rollup2
IS COSTLY IT'S TIME CONSUMING.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.481 region:rollup2
AND IT REQUIRES UMPS TECHNICAL

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.983 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE TO INDIA TO MEET

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:55.919 region:rollup2
LANDOWNER OBJECTIVES SO THERE

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:57.220 region:rollup2
ARE A VARIETY OF TOOLS.

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:58.555 region:rollup2
IN THE TOOL BOX TO GET THAT DONE

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.290 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED FIRE IS ABSOLUTELY

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.791 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THERE. BUT IT'S NOT

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.358 region:rollup2
THE ONLY TOOL AND IN MANY OF OUR

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.093 region:rollup2
AREAS OF OUR FORCE CAN'T BE

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:05.795 region:rollup2
USED.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:07.363 region:rollup2
WITHOUT FIRST ENGAGING IN OTHER

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.565 region:rollup2
MECHANICAL TREATMENTS FIRST

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:10.900 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FIRE THE FORCE ARE

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:11.568 region:rollup2
SO OVERGROWN. THAT PUTTING FIRE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.236 region:rollup2
EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:15.171 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS WILL DESTROY THE

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:16.573 region:rollup2
FORCE SO. IT'S A VARIETY OF

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:18.374 region:rollup2
TOOLS IT'S THAT THINNING FROM

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:19.542 region:rollup2
BELOW TO GET THE DEAD FUELS OUT

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:21.411 region:rollup2
FROM OF THE FOR THE UNDERSTOREY

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:22.879 region:rollup2
OF THE FORCED. ITS COMMERCIAL

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:24.347 region:rollup2
TIMBER HARVESTING BECAUSE PART

01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:26.549 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROCESS IS ALLOWING

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:27.884 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS TO GET SEPARATE COVER

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:29.719 region:rollup2
SOME COST OF DOING THE WORK.

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:30.353 region:rollup2
SO GETTING THAT ABOUT THOSE

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE TREES THAT THEY'RE

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:33.957 region:rollup2
REMOVING OUGHT TO A MIL TO HELP

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:37.060 region:rollup2
GET RECOVERIES THEY CAN REINVEST

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:38.795 region:rollup2
THAT. IN MANAGING THEIR FOREST

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.896 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE ABOUT

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:41.030 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO HAVE ENOUGH

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:42.165 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE WOOD PROCESSING

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:45.268 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WHETHER IT IS

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.236 region:rollup2
BIOMASS.

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:48.538 region:rollup2
TECH TO GENERATE NEW DABNEY

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:50.974 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY OR HEAT FROM THE BY

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS OF OF A FOREST MATERIAL

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:53.877 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE SAWMILLS THEMSELVES

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.545 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THERE IS A.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:57.413 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:59.482 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE ECONOMY ALL OF THOSE

01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:00.650 region:rollup2
ARE THINGS THAT ARE THINGS WE

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:02.218 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.753 region:rollup2
AND ENGAGING IN RIGHT NOW FOR

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:05.755 region:rollup2
GOING TO REALLY INCREASED THE

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:10.460 region:rollup2
PACE AND SCALE. OF OUR

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:12.295 region:rollup2

FOREST.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:38.421 region:rollup2
THAT FIRE DID NOT START IN THE

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.988 region:rollup2
FOREST.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:41.457 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:43.459 region:rollup2
THAT FIRE STARTED YEAH AND VERY

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:43.626 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO OUR URBAN AREA.

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.895 region:rollup2

IF IT WE IT WITH EVENTUALLY

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:50.133 region:rollup2
MOVED TO THE LOS PADRES FOREST

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:51.301 region:rollup2
BUT AND IT DIDN'T START THERE

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.702 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT AREAS LIKE

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.783 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY KIND OF GET PUSHED

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.551 region:rollup2
IN THAT DIRECTION FOR REASONS OF

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:09.719 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.887 region:rollup2
IS IT IS SOME OF YOUR

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:12.322 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS

SAME ARE THEY.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.958 region:rollup2
HE NO DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:17.160 region:rollup2
ON HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:19.295 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.630 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD QUESTION SO THE.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:22.165 region:rollup2
THE BASIC PREMISE OF FIRE

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND VEGETATION

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.034 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND FUELS TREATMENT.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.436 region:rollup2
.

01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:27.570 region:rollup2
APPLIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:08:26.436 --> 01:08:30.573 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW IS A VERY

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:31.908 region:rollup2
DIVERSE LANDSCAPE. THAT'S

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.376 region:rollup2
VEGETATION GO WE TALK A LOT

01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:35.545 region:rollup2
ABOUT ENGAGING IN OUR OUR

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:36.879 region:rollup2
FORESTS AND THINNING. IN THE

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:38.014 region:rollup2
FORESTED COMMUNITIES.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.349 region:rollup2
BUT SO MUCH OF THE STATE IS IN

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:40.883 region:rollup2
THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.552 region:rollup2
WERE BLURRED AND THE COMMUNITIES

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:44.053 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT WHERE

IAN BRUSH SCRUB.

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:52.996 region:rollup2
INTERFACE HOMES AND SO WHILE

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE TALKING LESS ABOUT

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:54.797 region:rollup2
FOREST THINNING THERE AND FOR IN

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:56.499 region:rollup2
ENFORCED RESILIENCE WERE

TRULY THERE ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:08:58.034 --> 01:09:01.137 region:rollup2
REDUCE FUEL LOADING.

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.738 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.773 region:rollup2
FIRES TO PROTECT HOMES HOW DO

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:06.075 region:rollup2
WE.

ARE IN PLACE OR REALLY.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:10.546 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE THE ONES WE HAVE IN

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:12.015 region:rollup2
PLACE WENT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.082 region:rollup2
A FIRE. PLEASE NINETY FIVE

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.183 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.852 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:17.453 region:rollup2
STARTED BY PEOPLE.

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:19.355 region:rollup2
FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS IT

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:21.658 region:rollup2
YA COME IT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:23.426 region:rollup2
PEOPLE START FIRES WE CAN FIND

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:25.061 region:rollup2
WAYS TO. PREVENT THAT YOU KNOW

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:26.362 region:rollup2
THROUGH OR REDUCE THOSE STARTS

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:27.530 region:rollup2
THROUGH A VARIETY OF PUBLIC

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:29.499 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.933 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PRACTICES

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.168 region:rollup2
SO.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.603 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG PORTION OF WORKING

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:35.104 region:rollup2
IN THE URBAN INTERFACE IS HOW DO

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.672 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT WHAT ARE CAUSES OF

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:38.975 region:rollup2
FIRES ARE IN THESE AREAS AND AND

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:41.244 region:rollup2
REALLY TARGET. A EFFORTS AT

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:43.413 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THAT UP TREATING FUELS A

01:09:41.244 --> 01:09:45.148 region:rollup2
BIG COMPONENT OF THE GREENHOUSE

01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:47.083 region:rollup2
GAS REDUCTION OR CAP AND TRADE.

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:48.418 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THIS YEAR IS FOCUSING ON

01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:49.552 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS FORMERLY THE FIRE

01:09:48.418 --> 01:09:51.254 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:53.122 region:rollup2
FUND AND THAT IS WORKING ON

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:54.524 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN AND AROUND

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.892 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE A IN THE

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.527 region:rollup2
AREA OF SAN APOLLO IN THOSE

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:58.661 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE THE THOMAS FIRE

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.030 region:rollup2
STARTED HOW DO WE.

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:02.999 region:rollup2
PUTTING FUEL BREAKS HOW DO WE

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.534 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT EVERY HOMEOWNER HAS

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:05.635 region:rollup2
THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.670 region:rollup2
AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE DOESN'T

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:09.105 region:rollup2
JUST PROTECT THE HOME OR THE

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.840 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE FROM AN ONCOMING FIRE.

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:12.542 region:rollup2
IT ALSO PROTECTS

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.509 region:rollup2
THE WILD LAND AND OTHER

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.011 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES FROM A FIRE THAT

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:16.846 region:rollup2
STARTS ARE IN YOUR HOME OR A

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:18.715 region:rollup2
VEHICLE FIRE. IT MAY OCCUR OFF

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:20.750 region:rollup2
TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR SOME

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:22.452 region:rollup2
OTHER SOURCE AND SO THE BASIC

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.953 region:rollup2
PREMISE OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2
FUELS TREATMENT AND FIRE

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.722 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.157 region:rollup2
REALLY APPLIES ACROSS

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:29.859 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT'S AS WE GET INTO

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:31.627 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FORCED TO COMMUNITIES

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:34.397 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:35.932 region:rollup2
RURAL VERSUS URBAN IT'S HOW WE

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.500 region:rollup2
APPLY IT AND IT'S BUT THE KINDS

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.735 region:rollup2
OF PROJECTS THAT WERE DOING.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:43.539 region:rollup2
TO HELP REDUCE FUEL LOADING AND

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:45.742 region:rollup2
PROTECT THAT INDUSTRY.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.809 region:rollup2
IT IS A QUESTIONS.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.411 region:rollup2
MS AGUIAR CURRY PUT I JUST HAVE

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:49.612 region:rollup2
ONE CRAP COMMENT THANK YOU VERY

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.347 region:rollup2
MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE IT YOU

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:53.182 region:rollup2
KNOW EXPENSE. A MS LEHMAN SAID

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:54.751 region:rollup2
IT WAS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THE

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.818 region:rollup2
BOTH OF US TO HER THOUGHT WE

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.520 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DEALING WITH. MY

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:59.889 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION WAS DURING THIS TIME

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.326 region:rollup2
WAS PEOPLE'S LACK OF. PERSONAL

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:03.893 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING CARE

01:11:03.326 --> 01:11:04.093 region:rollup2
OF THEIR PROPERTY.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:04.727 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.430 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:08.931 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS GREAT.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.800 region:rollup2
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.468 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.836 region:rollup2
ADDED TO SOME OF THE ISSUES AND

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:15.605 region:rollup2
HOW THE FIRE WENT THROUGH OUR

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:17.106 region:rollup2
AREA BUT. I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:19.642 region:rollup2
ADMIT THAT WE'VE GOTTA WORK ON

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:21.811 region:rollup2
PERSONAL.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:23.312 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ON THESE AND SO

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.814 region:rollup2
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN.

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:25.815 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.750 region:rollup2
THEY CLEAR THEIR AREAS FROM THE

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:29.585 region:rollup2
HOUSES.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.154 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON AND TO OUT

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:32.755 region:rollup2

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:35.358 region:rollup2

EVERY THIRD YEAR WILL BE RE

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
CONTACTING THE SAME HOMEOWNER

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:52.408 region:rollup2

SO THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:32.167 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS IN RECOVERY AYE WE

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:33.569 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE RECOVERY YOU KNOW

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:35.437 region:rollup2
IS RESPONSIBLE COVER REALLY

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:36.839 region:rollup2
BEGINS TO GATHER WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:38.240 region:rollup2
BEGIN THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE.

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:40.009 region:rollup2
RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IMMEDIATELY

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.976 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.011 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSE A CHEAP PEN WHAT

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.779 region:rollup2
THAT A GREAT JOB IN TALKING

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:45.581 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE APPROACH

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:47.750 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT THROUGH A UNIFIED

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:49.251 region:rollup2
COORDINATION GROUP ARE AND AND

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.186 region:rollup2
THE LEADERS OF OF THE PUBLIC

SAFETY ENTITIES COMING TOGETHER

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:55.024 region:rollup2
AS AS ONE TEAM. OUGHT TO TRY TO

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:56.959 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE THINGS EARLY ON

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:58.227 region:rollup2
AND PUT OUR METRICS IN PLACE TO

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.796 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:01.597 region:rollup2
PATHWAY. PERSISTS FOR SUCCESS IN

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.866 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:05.801 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT DOUBT

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:07.703 region:rollup2
WE WERE CHECKED HIT WITH SOME

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.605 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:10.606 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. OUT

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:11.173 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING LIKE WE HAD NOT

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:13.642 region:rollup2
SEEN.

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:16.111 region:rollup2
TO THE DEGREE IF THE SKY THE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:16.612 region:rollup2
SCALE THE SCOPE. ARE OUT OF AN

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.681 region:rollup2
EVENT.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:20.916 region:rollup2
AND AND THESE THIS THIS AMOUNT

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:22.251 region:rollup2
OF DEBRIS ARE AND WE KNOW THAT

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.386 region:rollup2
TACTIC BEGIN THAT RECOVERY

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:25.621 region:rollup2
PROCESS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.755 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO GET

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:28.190 region:rollup2
THE DEBRIS CLEARED OUT OF A

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:30.826 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT'S THAT'S. GOTTA

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:33.429 region:rollup2
BE JOB ONE AS WELL AS GETTING

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:36.732 region:rollup2

SAFE AND SECURE OUR HOUSING SO.

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:39.668 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOUR WEIGHT WEIGHT

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.737 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH THE

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:43.505 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF UP OF BOB BLOCKS THAT

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:45.774 region:rollup2
WE WE WERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:49.378 region:rollup2
IT WAS A COMPLEX DOT BEING. CAST

IT WASN'T JUST IN US AND AU MA

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:57.453 region:rollup2
MENDOCINO OR LAKE IN NAPA BUT WE

BUTTE AND PLOW SIR AND SO OUR

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.161 region:rollup2
ROLE.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:09.231 region:rollup2
IT'S PART OF THE DEFY

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:10.899 region:rollup2
COORDINATION GROUP AT THE STATE

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:14.136 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS CENTER WAS TO MAKE A

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:17.373 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC DECISION ON HOW BEST

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:21.310 region:rollup2
WE COULD COLLECTIVELY EAT THIS

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:24.580 region:rollup2
ELEPHANT AS A WHOLE. AND BEING

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:27.916 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO IN AND RAPIDLY MOVE

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:34.890 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO DEAL WITH.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:35.758 region:rollup2
THE DEBRIS CLEARANCE HOW EARLY

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.391 region:rollup2
ON I SET SOME RELATIVELY.

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:37.760 region:rollup2
STRINGENT.

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.394 region:rollup2
METRICS THAT THAT WE WANTED TO

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:44.233 region:rollup2
GET THESE COMMUNITIES CLEANED UP

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:44.967 region:rollup2
TURNED TO OUR PARTNERS A CAL

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:47.035 region:rollup2

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.611 region:rollup2
LOT.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:57.413 region:rollup2
IN BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND AND

01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:58.347 region:rollup2
WORK ON DEBRIS OCCURRENCE

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:59.715 region:rollup2

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:01.183 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF THE FIRES THAT

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:02.751 region:rollup2
WE DEAL WITH THAT THAT RESULT IN

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:04.253 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL LOSS IN THE STATE.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.988 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.790 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT BELOW

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:09.258 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO GET FEDERAL

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:13.061 region:rollup2
TWEETERS IT'S A STATE

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:14.997 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO WE TURN

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:16.532 region:rollup2
TO CAL RECYCLE A LOT TO GO UP

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:18.167 region:rollup2
AND DOWN THE STATE TO DO THESE

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:19.401 region:rollup2
DEBRIS CLEARANCE OPERATIONS.

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:20.436 region:rollup2
UP WE MADE THE DETERMINATION

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD SPLIT.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.672 region:rollup2

COUNTIES OF OF OF BEAUTY AND.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:30.179 region:rollup2
AYE NEVADA AND YUBA IMPOSTER

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:33.081 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HANDLED BY IDT S. IN

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:34.049 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLE AND THE OTHER

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.249 region:rollup2

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.718 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:38.620 region:rollup2
SONO MOB. LAKE NAPA AND

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.955 region:rollup2
MENDOCINO WE WOULD TURN TO THE

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.458 region:rollup2

TO BE ABLE TO TO.

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:50.265 region:rollup2
BEGIN THAT PROCESS WE WOULD SET

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:51.867 region:rollup2
THE METRICS IN THE REQUIREMENTS

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:53.635 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:55.671 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY BEGIN THE DEBRIS

01:23:23.232 --> 01:23:26.335 region:rollup2
OPERATION THAT IN ITSELF WAS A

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.302 region:rollup2
MONUMENTAL TASK.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.204 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THAT WE RAPIDLY MOVED

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:31.340 region:rollup2
IN TO START THE DEBRIS

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:32.908 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND AND. I CAN WILL

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.076 region:rollup2
TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW HOW THEY

LEG UP NAPA SONOMA MENDOCINO

01:23:54.263 --> 01:23:57.666 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT THE

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:58.700 region:rollup2

I COME TO TALK ABOUT IT IN

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:10.078 region:rollup2
NUMBERS IF YOU LOOK AT THIS.

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:12.314 region:rollup2
THIS GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE THAT.

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:14.249 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE

01:24:12.314 --> 01:24:17.753 region:rollup2
MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS HAS BEEN

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
REMOVED. THAT EQUALS ALMOST ONE

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:21.990 region:rollup2
AND ALL WILL THAT MORE THAN HALF

OF. US SECOND GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.293 region:rollup2
HE PUTS IT IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:25.327 region:rollup2
MUCH DEBRIS WERE ACTUALLY

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:26.795 region:rollup2

FIVE COUNTY AREA AND.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:34.503 region:rollup2
THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN REALLY.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:36.038 region:rollup2
OR NOW SEVENTY NINE PERCENT

01:24:34.503 --> 01:24:38.040 region:rollup2
COMPLETE WE'RE GONNA MEET THE

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:40.108 region:rollup2
METRIC THAT WE'VE SET FORTH. AND

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.676 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT BEEN WITHOUT. ON A

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.544 region:rollup2
SERIES OF CHALLENGES AND AND

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:43.579 region:rollup2
DOW.

LOVE.

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:47.416 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT THAT

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.518 region:rollup2
THAT CHART DOESN'T COMPUTE FOR

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.152 region:rollup2
ME CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:51.119 region:rollup2

.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.095 region:rollup2
SO.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.330 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE OVER FORTY HUNDRED

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.998 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN CLEARED.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:04.266 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A LESS THAN A

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:05.901 region:rollup2
THOUSAND REMAINING A LEGACY

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:07.035 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE PERCENT AND THIS IS

01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:08.870 region:rollup2
BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:10.672 region:rollup2
COMPLEX.

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:12.307 region:rollup2
AND CHALLENGING DEBRIS

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.809 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS WE FAX CERTAINLY BEEN

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:15.177 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST TO PRE OPERATION

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:16.278 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAD SINCE

01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:17.913 region:rollup2
SINCE THE NINETEEN OH SIX

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:19.348 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE AND OUT WE'RE TALKING

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:21.416 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THE REQUIREMENT OF

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:23.151 region:rollup2
REMOVING DEBRIS. I CAN'T SAY

OF THE CONDITIONS BUT IN

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:51.139 region:rollup2
REALITY WE HAD FIRES THAT BROKE

BARBARA. AND.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:07.489 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ALL OF ALL THOSE

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:09.558 region:rollup2
FIRES THE BIGGEST UP OBVIOUSLY

01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:13.395 region:rollup2
IT WAS THE THOMAS FIRE AND.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:14.162 region:rollup2
IT WAS IT'S THE BIGGEST NOW TO

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.430 region:rollup2
DATE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.931 region:rollup2
ARE ALL OF THOSE OF COURSE

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:16.565 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN AYE AYE AN

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:17.666 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL. FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.834 region:rollup2
SO STRUCTURES LOST.

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.702 region:rollup2
IN ALL OF THOSE FIRES AND UP

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:20.902 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:23.672 region:rollup2
THE.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:25.707 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME REALLY THE FOCUS

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:27.109 region:rollup2
WAS IT SAN DIEGO COUNTY WAS.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:27.809 region:rollup2
WAS WHAT WAS VERY WELL

01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:28.910 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE BUT THE NUMBER

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:30.178 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THEY WERE GOING TO

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.947 region:rollup2
HANDLE THEIR OWN.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:34.216 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH EYES.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:36.752 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR DEBRIS.

01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:39.121 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS BUT DEVON TARA.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.454 region:rollup2
WAS A BIT MORE UP COMPLEX AND

01:27:39.121 --> 01:27:40.689 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.657 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:44.493 region:rollup2
WAS A HEAVY LIFT FOR THEM AND

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.528 region:rollup2
SO IN THIS CASE AGAIN WE TURN TO

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:48.830 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLING DTS SEE. ARE AND

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:50.132 region:rollup2
THEY MOVE FORWARD TO A RAPIDLY

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:52.534 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD I WOULD SAY.

01:27:50.132 --> 01:27:54.069 region:rollup2
TO TO JUMP IN AND BEGIN THE

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:56.338 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND TO THIS DAY.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:58.440 region:rollup2
CAO RECYCLE IS HANDLING THE.

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:59.141 region:rollup2
DEBRIS REMOVAL INVENT BETTER

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.076 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:03.245 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:03.445 region:rollup2
PARCELS HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND

01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:05.881 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:07.916 region:rollup2
DATA I'LL CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:09.417 region:rollup2
UP PARCELS ARE ALREADY COMPLETE

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:11.153 region:rollup2
AND THAT. THERE'S ANOTHER CHART

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.587 region:rollup2
HERE THAT THE TALKS ABOUT SOME

01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:13.688 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPLEX IS ONE IS THE.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:15.824 region:rollup2
MOST THESE HOMES THE MIDDLE

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:17.225 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY THE PIT DEPENDING

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:19.394 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE THEY'RE BUILT BEFORE

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:20.996 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ASBESTOS

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:21.897 region:rollup2
ARE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S PROBABLY

01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:24.800 region:rollup2
TO. TAKE THE CLEAR THROUGH ITS

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.801 region:rollup2
NOT JUST MOVING HOUSE WILL HOW

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.002 region:rollup2
DOES WASTE BUT IT'S CLAIMING

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:29.604 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BEST IS BEFORE WE CAN

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:30.505 region:rollup2
MOVE IN AND EVERY MOVE THOSE

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.406 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:31.907 region:rollup2
BUT THE BRIE.

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:33.008 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:34.776 region:rollup2
AND AND THIS CHART DISH JUST

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:36.077 region:rollup2
REITERATE WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.212 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PARCELS APPROVED

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:39.447 region:rollup2
AND THE NUMBER.

01:28:37.212 --> 01:28:41.583 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE AND

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:43.084 region:rollup2
END UP AGAIN THE METRICS THERE.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.853 region:rollup2
ARE THAT.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:46.588 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THIS WILL BE

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:48.957 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AND AND PROBABLY EARLY

01:28:46.588 --> 01:28:50.792 region:rollup2
APRIL AND DOW AT THIS POINT.

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:51.860 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS IN IN LINE TO

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:53.361 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THOSE.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.396 region:rollup2
METRICS.

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.931 region:rollup2
THEN OF COURSE.

01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
.

WAS VERY.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:06.942 region:rollup2
VERY STRESSFUL WHEN THE WHOLE

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:08.476 region:rollup2
STATE WAS REALLY IN THIS RED

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:10.679 region:rollup2
FLAG AND.

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:12.581 region:rollup2
THE FIRE CAME DOWN VERY CLOSE

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.049 region:rollup2

BURNED COMPLETELY AROUND ALL

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:20.055 region:rollup2
HIGH AND IT WAS REALLY IF YOU

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.022 region:rollup2

THE AREA ABOVE SANTA BARBARA.

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:34.402 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MOSTLY LOS PADRES

NATIONAL FOREST LIBERTY WAS

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:39.941 region:rollup2
DENUDED OF ALL WATERSHED.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:42.544 region:rollup2

THAT THAT AND THE EXPOSURE OF

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:52.654 region:rollup2
THE MY WITH NO WATERSHED TO

CAPTURE WATER. COULD RESULT IN.

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:56.491 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC FLOODING.

01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:58.159 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:59.895 region:rollup2
WE KNEW THIS AND.

BEFORE.

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:16.878 region:rollup2
BUT ANY FLOODING PARTICULAR

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:18.647 region:rollup2
PLACE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF HIGH

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:20.849 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:23.518 region:rollup2
WHERE DOT WE ANTICIPATED HOW IT

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:25.086 region:rollup2
IN PLANNING TO BOB BE ADVANCED

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.887 region:rollup2
AND AND PREPARE FOR THAT?

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:28.089 region:rollup2

SO YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T MAKE

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:46.841 region:rollup2
THIS STUFF UP SO.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:49.110 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:51.146 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH IT SHOULD

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:52.681 region:rollup2

HAVE NOT SEEN IN CALIFORNIA

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:58.954 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:30:55.150 --> 01:31:00.822 region:rollup2
BUT A CATASTROPHIC MUD FLOWS

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:01.456 region:rollup2
ARE OF SUCH PROPORTION.

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:03.758 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:06.828 region:rollup2
IT IT IT LITERALLY TOOK OUT.

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:07.662 region:rollup2
LARGE SWATHS OF OF THE SEA AT

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:09.831 region:rollup2
THE COUNT OF MANSIO.

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:12.200 region:rollup2
AND AND RESTRUCTURE PROPERTY

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:13.034 region:rollup2
LINES AND RESTRUCTURED.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.570 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:18.406 region:rollup2
LAND DEMOGRAPHICS.

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:20.108 region:rollup2
HUGE BOULDERS AND OTHER KINDS

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:22.143 region:rollup2
DEPRECIABLE TWENTY FEET HIGH

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:23.478 region:rollup2
TREASON SECTOR TAKING OUT HOMES

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2
AS THEY COME CAME DOWN AND

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:27.382 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY. TAKING OUT ARE A

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:28.116 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF LIVES.

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:31.519 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:33.121 region:rollup2
IT IN THIS AGAIN RESULTED IN

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:34.489 region:rollup2
AGAIN ONE OF ICE I SAY IT WAS

01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:35.857 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX AND AND

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.492 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED IN THE NORTHERN

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:39.060 region:rollup2
FIRES WE ARE NOW IF WE WERE NOW

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:40.261 region:rollup2
FACING ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED UP

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.695 region:rollup2
COMPLEX.

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.664 region:rollup2
SET OF.

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:44.866 region:rollup2
DEBRIS OPERATIONS WITH THIS MOD.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.667 region:rollup2
THE KEY THING HERE WAS THAT

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.235 region:rollup2
DUMB.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:49.104 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO WRITTEN

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.938 region:rollup2
WE NEED IT TO WE WERE CONCERNED

01:31:49.104 --> 01:31:52.140 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SECOND STORM.

01:31:49.938 --> 01:31:53.975 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.343 region:rollup2
CREEKS AND THE AND THE DEBRIS

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:57.679 region:rollup2
BASIS HAD COME BECOME. TOTALLY

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:59.314 region:rollup2
FALL AND SO WE CAN TURN TO THE

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:00.448 region:rollup2
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS UP

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:01.549 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR CONTRACT

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:04.252 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY.

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:05.086 region:rollup2
DTS HE WAS ALREADY GONE AND OUT

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.754 region:rollup2
COVER CYCLE COMMITTED INVENTOR

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:08.256 region:rollup2
UP.

01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:09.491 region:rollup2
AND WE WE TURN TO THE CORE TUBE

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.992 region:rollup2
TO BRING IN THEIR CONTRACTORS

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:12.594 region:rollup2
AND TO IMMEDIATELY START WORKING

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.895 region:rollup2
ON THOSE TO PRE BASES WE WHAT WE

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:15.530 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT IF WE HAD ANOTHER

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:16.798 region:rollup2
STORM WE NEED TO LEAST GET.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE THE BASINS CLEARING

01:32:16.798 --> 01:32:20.001 region:rollup2
THOSE CREEKS CLEAR TO BE ABLE TO

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:20.268 region:rollup2
TAKE THE ROLE THAT THE RIGHT

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:22.804 region:rollup2
OFF.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:23.638 region:rollup2
AND SO WE IDENTIFIED ELEVEN A

01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:26.307 region:rollup2
DEBRIS BASINS.

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:27.976 region:rollup2
AND DUCKED AND THE TO DATE TEN

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:29.878 region:rollup2
OF THOSE LAWS HAVE BEEN CLEARED.

01:32:27.976 --> 01:32:32.747 region:rollup2
ARM AND WE ALSO IDENTIFIED.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:34.149 region:rollup2
TEN A CREEK SYSTEMS AND FIVE OF

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:35.483 region:rollup2
THOSE TEN CREEKS HAVE BEEN.

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:35.984 region:rollup2
CLEARED THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:37.919 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:40.155 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:42.524 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LOT MORE DEBRIS IT'S

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:43.758 region:rollup2
SITTING ABOVE MONNA SETO GOD YET

01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:45.593 region:rollup2
TO COME DOWN AND SO WHAT WE WERE

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:48.129 region:rollup2
WE WERE REALLY RAPIDLY.

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:48.329 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD TO GET THAT THAT

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:49.497 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:51.466 region:rollup2
AND.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:52.867 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH ALL THE STATE

01:32:51.466 --> 01:32:54.369 region:rollup2
LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:56.404 region:rollup2
EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:58.106 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THIS ALL COME TOGETHER

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:59.307 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SORT OF IMAGINE.

01:32:58.106 --> 01:33:01.609 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:02.510 region:rollup2
AT ONE TIME WE HAVE WE

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:04.546 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY.

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:06.848 region:rollup2
MANAGING THREE YOU KNOW

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:08.416 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THREE

01:33:06.848 --> 01:33:10.718 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.319 region:rollup2
AND.

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.821 region:rollup2
IT.

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:14.589 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN

01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:16.424 region:rollup2
DONE THE HOUSING THE DEBRIS THE

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:17.926 region:rollup2
DEBRIS OPERATIONS GETTING ALL

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:19.794 region:rollup2
THE SWEET WE SORT OF ALLIES HAVE

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:21.563 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL BEEN DONE IN IN A FIVE

THAT.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.636 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S HARD TO REALLY SORT

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:31.039 region:rollup2
OF COMPREHENSION BUT.

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:32.774 region:rollup2

STRUCTURE IS BURNED.

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:24.652 region:rollup2
LEAD IS RELEASED MERCURY RICH IS

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:25.954 region:rollup2
RELEASED AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:27.221 region:rollup2
LOT OF RELEASE OF MATERIALS THAT

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:28.323 region:rollup2
EXIST WITHIN THE SOILS

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:30.024 region:rollup2

FOR FIRES IN TWO YEARS AND AND

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:42.270 region:rollup2
WE'VE STRUGGLED OFTEN.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.771 region:rollup2
AND IN THOSE CLEANUPS BECAUSE OF

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:45.039 region:rollup2
ARSENIC AND LEAD AND MERCURY AND

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:46.608 region:rollup2
OTHER CAN HEAVY METALS THAT REST

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:47.942 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT SOIL BECAUSE OF THE

01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:49.877 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF MINING.

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:52.247 region:rollup2
AND THE HISTORY OF OFTEN

01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:54.082 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON TOP OF OLD BURN.

01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:56.517 region:rollup2
FROM DECADES PAST.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:58.052 region:rollup2
THAT COMES UP TO THE SURFACE.

01:35:56.517 --> 01:36:00.455 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO REACH A BACKGROUND

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:03.391 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE NEED TO RESTORE A SAFE

01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:05.326 region:rollup2
PROPERTY A SAFE COMMUNITY BACK

TO THOSE RESIDENTS.

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:09.864 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH A

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.699 region:rollup2
TASK WITH ADDRESSING THAT BUT

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:13.434 region:rollup2
ALSO HELPING TO FACILITATE

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:14.769 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY PROCESS.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:16.337 region:rollup2

REBUILD.

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:21.342 region:rollup2
TO THAT POINT.

01:36:19.407 --> 01:36:22.910 region:rollup2
I WAS THAT I WAS INVENTORY LAST

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:24.612 region:rollup2
WEEK ATTENDED AN ALL HANDS

WHO ARE OUT THERE DOING IT?

01:36:28.316 --> 01:36:32.520 region:rollup2
AND I ASKED THEM YOU KNOW WHY DO

01:36:32.587 --> 01:36:36.291 region:rollup2
AND THE RESPONSE.

INTERTWINED OPERATING

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.744 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES.

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:04.946 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS SAFETY.

OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO

THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEVASTATION

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.202 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES IS NOT

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:50.271 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A DRIVING FACTOR IN

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:52.273 region:rollup2
TERMS OF COST.

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:54.241 region:rollup2
YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE BUTTE FIRE.

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:55.476 region:rollup2
FORGIVE ME THE THE.

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:57.078 region:rollup2
YES THE BUTTE FIRE WAS EIGHT

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:58.579 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PARCELS

01:41:57.078 --> 01:41:59.747 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS NEARLY A HUNDRED

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:03.250 region:rollup2
AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:41:59.747 --> 01:42:04.218 region:rollup2
COST THOSE CALAVERAS COUNTY.

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:05.486 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:06.921 region:rollup2
EVERY FIRE IS DIFFERENT EVERY

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:08.623 region:rollup2
EVENT IS DIFFERENT NONE OF THEM

01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:09.790 region:rollup2
ARE SIMPLER BUT SOME ARE NONE OF

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.791 region:rollup2
THEM ARE SIMPLE BUT SUMMER

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.259 region:rollup2
SIMPLER THAN OTHERS THE

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:14.328 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WITH CALAVERAS.

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:16.597 region:rollup2
WAS. WHAT YOU HEARD FROM

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:18.299 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR PIMLOTT?

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:19.967 region:rollup2
HIS THE SPREAD OF DEBRIS THESE

01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:21.268 region:rollup2
WERE LARGE PARCELS.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:23.504 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:25.039 region:rollup2
.

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.806 region:rollup2
FUND PERMITTED STRUCTURES THAT

01:42:25.039 --> 01:42:27.008 region:rollup2
WERE SIMPLY BUILT BY THE

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:28.642 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS THERE THERE WERE A LOT

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:30.978 region:rollup2
OF COLLECTORS SO IT WAS VERY

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:32.580 region:rollup2
COSTLY IN TERMS OF BE ACCESS TO

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:35.182 region:rollup2
THESE AS WELL AS THE SHEER

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:37.284 region:rollup2
VOLUME OF MATERIAL. SO THERE'S

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:38.552 region:rollup2
NO REAL GAUGE IT'S JUST ALL

01:42:37.284 --> 01:42:40.421 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT BURNS.

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:41.322 region:rollup2
.

01:42:40.421 --> 01:42:43.557 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT SEVERAL

01:42:41.322 --> 01:42:45.126 region:rollup2
WITHIN LAKE COUNTY AND THEN

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:46.460 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE THOMAS FIRE AND

01:42:45.126 --> 01:42:48.162 region:rollup2
THEN WE WERE PART OF THAT MUCH

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.764 region:rollup2
MUD SLIDE AND A DEBRIS BASIN

01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:52.099 region:rollup2
REMOVAL EFFORTS. IN SANTA

THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:57.438 region:rollup2
RECENT ADVANCES AS I HAVE

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:59.573 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED.

01:42:57.438 --> 01:43:01.609 region:rollup2
OUR PARTICIPATION IS THERE ON

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:03.210 region:rollup2
THE LEFT A WITH BUTTE NEVADA YOU

THAT WAS AN EIGHT WEEK EFFORT

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.983 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STRUCTURES

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:11.018 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE.

01:43:08.983 --> 01:43:12.553 region:rollup2
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:14.321 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO ENGAGE AND CONNECT

IN.

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:20.361 region:rollup2
COOPERATION WITH SOME OF ARE

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.129 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING CRUZ CAL RECYCLE

SOMETHING OF A CHRISTMAS EVEN

01:43:26.434 --> 01:43:28.903 region:rollup2
THOUGH THEY HAD LOST EVERYTHING

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.870 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY TO PASS THE BOAT TO

01:43:28.903 --> 01:43:31.939 region:rollup2
KIND OF GIVE THESE. GIVE THESE

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.440 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:33.007 region:rollup2
SOME SEMBLANCE OF A OF A

HOLIDAY.

01:43:33.007 --> 01:43:36.744 region:rollup2
.

01:43:35.509 --> 01:43:38.579 region:rollup2
WE'RE INVOLVED IN A SMALL

01:43:36.744 --> 01:43:39.480 region:rollup2
PORTION OF LAKE COUNTY AND THEN

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.948 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT EFFORTS OF

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.016 region:rollup2
TRINITY BEEN TORN SANTA BARBARA

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:43.751 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE SENATE

01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:45.820 region:rollup2
THINK NEEDS TO BEEMPHASIZED IS

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:48.055 region:rollup2
THESE ARE OVERLAPPING EVENTS.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.957 region:rollup2
WHILE WORST JUST FINISHING ONE

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:51.258 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND WILL BEGIN AND SO

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:53.060 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF MOBILIZATION

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:54.261 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO ON THERE'S A LOT OF

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.730 region:rollup2
TIME IN DETAIL.

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:57.031 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE AND TO

THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:18.119 region:rollup2
TWO CUBIC YARDS OF MATERIAL OF

01:44:16.117 --> 01:44:19.753 region:rollup2
ITS PARTS FOR IN TERMS OF SOIL

01:44:18.119 --> 01:44:21.222 region:rollup2
ROCK WOULD WASTE AND METALS.

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:22.923 region:rollup2
AND WE DID THIS.

01:44:21.222 --> 01:44:24.692 region:rollup2
WE MOBILIZED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:26.794 region:rollup2
HOURS AND THIS WAS OVER THE

01:44:24.692 --> 01:44:29.830 region:rollup2
COURSE OF A ONE MONTH TO KIND OF

01:44:26.794 --> 01:44:30.364 region:rollup2
CLEAR THIS AREA. OF ONCE AGAIN

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.532 region:rollup2
AND EXTRAORDINARY JOB BY.

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:32.833 region:rollup2
.

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:34.702 region:rollup2
THE OF THE TEAM I AM VERY PROUD

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:36.670 region:rollup2
TO OVERSEE. AND HANDLING THE

01:44:34.702 --> 01:44:38.372 region:rollup2
THIS MATTER.

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:40.274 region:rollup2
HERE'S A PHOTO OF THAT DEBRIS

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:42.376 region:rollup2
REMOVAL OPERATION ARE EXCUSE ME

01:44:40.274 --> 01:44:42.943 region:rollup2
THE OF PROCESSING AND TRANSFER.

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:44.078 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE DOING ON THE

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:45.446 region:rollup2
VENTURA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND

01:44:44.078 --> 01:44:46.347 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE.

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:47.281 region:rollup2
THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT'S

01:44:46.347 --> 01:44:48.716 region:rollup2
INVOLVED THE TRUCKS THAT ARE

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:50.050 region:rollup2
COMING INTO THIS.

01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:52.153 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL IS SORTED.

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.521 region:rollup2
AND.

01:44:52.153 --> 01:44:54.822 region:rollup2
WHILE IT IS HEAVY EQUIPMENT IT

01:44:53.521 --> 01:44:56.724 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPRESSIVE THING TO WATCH

01:44:54.822 --> 01:44:58.859 region:rollup2
THESE OPERATORS MANEUVER THROUGH

01:44:56.724 --> 01:45:01.061 region:rollup2
THIS MATERIAL AND AND TEASE OUT

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:02.296 region:rollup2
WOOD AND ROCK AND MATURE FROM

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:04.031 region:rollup2
BIG PILES WITH THIS HEAVY

01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:05.099 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THEY THEY REALLY ARE.

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:07.001 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINAIRE PROFESSIONALS.

01:45:05.099 --> 01:45:09.270 region:rollup2
WHO DO THIS?

01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:11.071 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS THIS IS A TYPICAL

01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:11.705 region:rollup2
AMERICAN TRANSFER PROCESSING THE

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:14.175 region:rollup2
MUD.

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:16.710 region:rollup2
AS MOST YOU MAY KNOW WAS.

01:45:14.175 --> 01:45:19.613 region:rollup2
DISPERSED TOO UGLY TO BEACH.

01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:21.182 region:rollup2
THE WOOD WAS. SENT OFF TO CHIP

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:21.715 region:rollup2
VERY FACILITY IN THE ROCK WAS

01:45:21.182 --> 01:45:25.386 region:rollup2
PART OF A A RECYCLING I'M

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:26.554 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:28.155 region:rollup2
I REALIZE YOU CAN'T SEE THIS

01:45:26.554 --> 01:45:30.558 region:rollup2
SINCE YOU MENTION HAS BEEN TELL

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:31.959 region:rollup2
US A BESIDES THE AND THE MUD

01:45:30.558 --> 01:45:33.627 region:rollup2
GOING TO DELETE A BEACH WHERE

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:35.462 region:rollup2
ELSE I MEAN THAT THERE'S A HUGE

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:36.730 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF DEBRIS CORRECT WHERE

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:38.399 region:rollup2
ELSE DID IT GO.

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:40.167 region:rollup2
EGGHEAD BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF

01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:41.068 region:rollup2
OUR CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS WE

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:43.504 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A LOT.

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:45.406 region:rollup2
OF THIS REMAINING AND WHERE CAN

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:46.473 region:rollup2
WE PUT THIS AND WATER WHAT ARE

01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:47.908 region:rollup2
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IS YOUR

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:49.510 region:rollup2
QUESTION RELATIVE TO THEM THE

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:51.178 region:rollup2
MUD.

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:52.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WITH MY DARTED THAT THE

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:54.715 region:rollup2
DEBRIS FROM THE.

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:57.851 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PROPERTIES THAT'S GOING

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:59.987 region:rollup2
TO TO LANDFILLS ALIKE TIGERS AND

01:45:57.851 --> 01:46:00.588 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER OUTLYING LAND SO

01:45:59.987 --> 01:46:02.957 region:rollup2
YOU'RE JUST DOING THE DEBRIS

01:46:00.588 --> 01:46:04.225 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE FOR PUBLIC PROPERTY IS

01:46:02.957 --> 01:46:05.359 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU'RE DOING

01:46:04.225 --> 01:46:06.794 region:rollup2
RED EYED ANGELA CORRECT AREN'T

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:08.529 region:rollup2
ANY ARE YOU SENDING IT TO TO HE

01:46:06.794 --> 01:46:12.166 region:rollup2
GOES. PART OF IT IS GOING THERE

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:12.733 region:rollup2
AND CRY WAS THE DECISION MADE

01:46:12.166 --> 01:46:13.567 region:rollup2
WHERE IT GOES

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.268 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF THE COLLABORATION

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.569 region:rollup2
THAT GOES ON WITH LOCAL

01:46:14.268 --> 01:46:17.204 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WE WORK WITH THE

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:18.305 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. TO

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:19.974 region:rollup2
HELP DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE

01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:20.941 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LANDFILLS THAT CAN

01:46:19.974 --> 01:46:22.443 region:rollup2
HANDLE THAT WHAT IS THEIR

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:24.812 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

01:46:22.443 --> 01:46:26.247 region:rollup2
AND SO AGAIN IT'S PART OF THAT

01:46:24.812 --> 01:46:27.882 region:rollup2
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT

01:46:26.247 --> 01:46:29.883 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY ARE THAT WE ARE

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:30.885 region:rollup2
REACHING OUT TO THEM THE LOCAL

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:32.720 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS REACHING OUT TO

01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:34.154 region:rollup2
THEM. AND SO WE WON'T FORCE

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.623 region:rollup2
OURSELVES ON A ON A LAND FILL IT

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.891 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

01:46:35.623 --> 01:46:38.392 region:rollup2
WILLING TO ACCEPT AND SO IN SOME

01:46:36.891 --> 01:46:40.294 region:rollup2
CASES WE DO.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:41.428 region:rollup2
RENT AND ISSUES WHERE LANDFILL

01:46:40.294 --> 01:46:42.296 region:rollup2
MAY NOT HAVE THE KIND OF

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:45.232 region:rollup2
CAPACITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:46:42.296 --> 01:46:46.433 region:rollup2
NEED AND SO WE WORKED WITH

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:48.002 region:rollup2
ANOTHER NEIGHBORING.

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:49.103 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT AND

01:46:48.002 --> 01:46:50.971 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THE COSTS THAT YOU

01:46:49.103 --> 01:46:52.773 region:rollup2
SUFFER CALAVERAS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:54.341 region:rollup2
WAS MOVING THAT MATERIAL AWAY

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:56.143 region:rollup2
FROM LANDFILLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE

01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:57.845 region:rollup2
THE CAPACITY AND TAKING IT.

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:59.179 region:rollup2
A SEVENTY MILES FURTHER BECAUSE

01:46:57.845 --> 01:47:00.914 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE MATERIAL COULD

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:02.416 region:rollup2

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:47.861 region:rollup2
LOCAL AIRFORCE BASE THEY CAME

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:49.596 region:rollup2
OUT. IT WAS FINE THEY REMOVED IT

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:50.197 region:rollup2
BUT IT DID AT FOR A BIT OF DRAMA

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:52.032 region:rollup2
THAT DAY IN A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:52:50.197 --> 01:52:54.134 region:rollup2
SLOWDOWN.

01:52:52.032 --> 01:52:55.535 region:rollup2
SO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IS

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:56.937 region:rollup2
REMOVED THAT UPON RECEIPT OF A

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:58.605 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF ENTRY FORM WHICH IS

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:59.840 region:rollup2
THAT PROPERTY OWNERS PERMISSION

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:01.074 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.609 region:rollup2
BEGIN.

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:05.078 region:rollup2
REMOVING MATERIAL FROM THEIR

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:05.612 region:rollup2
PROPERTY. WE DO ASIDE ASSESSMENT

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.813 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED WE BEGIN TO

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:09.549 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:11.385 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WHAT THAT PROPERTY HAS

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:13.153 region:rollup2
ITS ITS FOOTAGE ARM.

01:53:11.385 --> 01:53:16.056 region:rollup2
MOORINGS.

01:53:13.153 --> 01:53:17.291 region:rollup2
RETAINING WALLS FOUNDATIONS

01:53:16.056 --> 01:53:18.292 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT'S THEIR THAT WE

01:53:17.291 --> 01:53:19.793 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME

01:53:18.292 --> 01:53:21.294 region:rollup2
IN AND ADDRESS.

01:53:19.793 --> 01:53:23.730 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ASBESTOS SURVEY AND A

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:25.198 region:rollup2
REMOVAL AND THEN VEHICLES ARE

01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:27.167 region:rollup2
ARE REMOVED AND CHIMNEYS AND

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:28.468 region:rollup2
CHIMNEYS BECAME QUITE A QUITE A

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:30.637 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON FOR US IN VENTURA

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:32.105 region:rollup2
WAIT. NEARLY EVERY HOME AND HAD

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:33.940 region:rollup2
A CHIMNEY AND SO THAT ADDS A

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:36.076 region:rollup2
LAYER OF COMPLEXITY AND AND

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:38.812 region:rollup2
SAFETY RISK FOR US SO WE HAD TO

01:53:36.076 --> 01:53:40.247 region:rollup2
PARK ARE AT IN. BONN.

01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:41.581 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS WHO TAKE DOWN

01:53:40.247 --> 01:53:42.449 region:rollup2
CHIMNEYS AND AND REMOVE THAT

01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:43.784 region:rollup2
MATERIAL.

01:53:42.449 --> 01:53:44.551 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE HAZARDS

01:53:43.784 --> 01:53:46.253 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OFTEN

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:47.621 region:rollup2
ASBESTOS.

01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:50.357 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING WAY METALS ASH

01:53:47.621 --> 01:53:52.159 region:rollup2
DEBRIS AND CONCRETE WE REMOVED

01:53:50.357 --> 01:53:53.727 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDATION THIS IS A

01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:55.262 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THAT THAT THE STATE OF

01:53:53.727 --> 01:53:56.596 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED.

01:53:55.262 --> 01:53:58.198 region:rollup2
ARE READ OF THE SCIENCE IN THE

01:53:56.596 --> 01:54:00.067 region:rollup2
LITERATURE ON THIS IS THAT UNDER

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:02.336 region:rollup2
THESE EXTREME HEAT SITUATIONS

01:54:00.067 --> 01:54:05.038 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRITY OF THAT CONCRETE.

01:54:02.336 --> 01:54:06.940 region:rollup2
IS NOT SOUND IT'S GONE IT NEEDS

01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:08.675 region:rollup2
TO BE REMOVED AND THIS AGAIN IS

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:09.910 region:rollup2
WHAT ADDS TO THE COST IN THE

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:11.478 region:rollup2
VOLUME OF WHAT OF WHAT WE'RE

01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:13.513 region:rollup2
REMOVING.

01:54:11.478 --> 01:54:14.648 region:rollup2
ONCE THE PARCEL IS COMPLETELY

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:16.149 region:rollup2
CLEARED WE DO SOIL CONFIRMATION

01:54:14.648 --> 01:54:17.317 region:rollup2
SAMPLING.

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:18.852 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT WAS TO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:21.121 region:rollup2
MEASURE BACKGROUND LEVELS WHAT

01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:22.923 region:rollup2
WAS THE LEVEL OF HAZARDOUS

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:26.126 region:rollup2
MATERIALS HAS HEAVY METALS. IN

01:54:22.923 --> 01:54:28.061 region:rollup2
THAT AREA PRIOR TO THE FIRE.

01:54:26.126 --> 01:54:30.430 region:rollup2
AND WE MATCH THAT THROUGH OUR

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:32.432 region:rollup2
SOIL CONFIRMATION SAMPLING.

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:33.967 region:rollup2
WE COME IN SOMETIMES WE SCRAPE

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:35.969 region:rollup2
SEVERAL INCHES DOWN TO GET THE

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:37.738 region:rollup2
SOIL CLEAN WE TESTED IF IT

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:39.740 region:rollup2
RETURNS HOT WE CONTINUE TO

01:54:37.738 --> 01:54:41.208 region:rollup2
SCRAPE ON AS I MENTIONED IN LAKE

01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:42.743 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE WERE DIGGING AS DEEP

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:44.277 region:rollup2
AS TENDENTIOUS SOMETIMES. TO

01:54:42.743 --> 01:54:45.979 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY RESTORE TO THOSE

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:47.180 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND LEVELS BUT THAT IS

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:49.349 region:rollup2
OUR COMMITMENT TO RETURN THAT

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:51.385 region:rollup2
PROPERTY. I'M SAFELY. A FINAL

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:53.487 region:rollup2
INSPECTION IS CONDUCTED AND THEN

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:55.155 region:rollup2
THAT PROPERTY ONCE ALL THE OF

01:54:53.487 --> 01:54:56.189 region:rollup2
EROSION CONTROL AND EVERYTHING

01:54:55.155 --> 01:54:58.158 region:rollup2
IS PUT INTO PLACE.

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:59.593 region:rollup2
IT IS RETURNED TO THE COUNTY.

01:54:58.158 --> 01:55:01.495 region:rollup2
AND THEN RETURNED TO THE

01:54:59.593 --> 01:55:02.763 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNER.

01:55:01.495 --> 01:55:03.830 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT

01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:05.098 region:rollup2
INVENTORY YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:06.266 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE NUMBERS WE HAVE

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:07.868 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

01:55:06.266 --> 01:55:09.202 region:rollup2
SITES REGISTERED.

01:55:07.868 --> 01:55:11.138 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT WE ASSESSED SIX

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:12.773 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN.

01:55:11.138 --> 01:55:13.940 region:rollup2
YOU'LL NOTE THAT DUMB THE OTHER

01:55:12.773 --> 01:55:16.376 region:rollup2
A FEW SITES THAT WERE NOT

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.944 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN. A

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:19.913 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR THEY MAY

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:22.549 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ONLY A PARTIAL BURN

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:25.685 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WE. TRY AND STICK WITH

01:55:22.549 --> 01:55:26.620 region:rollup2
JUST A TOTAL DESTRUCTION.

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:28.455 region:rollup2
SITES WITH THE.

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:30.257 region:rollup2
WITH BALK AS BEST AS

01:55:28.455 --> 01:55:32.092 region:rollup2
I THE NUMBER PARCELS THAT WE'VE

01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:33.493 region:rollup2
COMPLETED AND THEN TO PROVE FOR

01:55:32.092 --> 01:55:34.928 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AND SO WORRIED

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:36.696 region:rollup2
ABOUT A TWENTY THREE PERCENT

01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:38.999 region:rollup2
COMPLETION RATE THIS BEGAN IN.

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:40.367 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY AND AS

01:55:38.999 --> 01:55:42.936 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD WERE HOPING.

01:55:40.367 --> 01:55:46.706 region:rollup2
IT IF ALL GOES WELL TO BE DONE

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:47.941 region:rollup2
BY THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL.

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:50.277 region:rollup2
EARLY APRIL.

01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:51.278 region:rollup2
NEWTON.

01:55:50.277 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
SO HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF

01:55:51.278 --> 01:55:54.014 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:55.382 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED SUMMER SIMPLER

01:55:54.014 --> 01:55:56.850 region:rollup2
THAN OTHERS.

01:55:55.382 --> 01:56:00.353 region:rollup2
THIS IN MANY WAYS IS IS A BIT OF

01:55:56.850 --> 01:56:00.353 region:rollup2
A SIMPLER PART OF PARCEL.

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.523 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FEW HAZARD TREES AND

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:05.425 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE AROUND THAT.

01:56:03.523 --> 01:56:06.993 region:rollup2
BUT THAT SHOULD BE A RATHER

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:08.094 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD. MAYBE A COUPLE

01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:09.996 region:rollup2
OF DAYS.

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:12.466 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THAT PARCEL NAM AND AND

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:13.266 region:rollup2
RESTORE IT.

01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:15.435 region:rollup2
BUT THEN YOU START TO RUN INTO

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:16.503 region:rollup2
SOME MORE COMPLEXITY.

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:18.438 region:rollup2
THIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF

01:56:16.503 --> 01:56:20.207 region:rollup2
HILLSIDE WERE STANDING ATOP A

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:21.842 region:rollup2
DESTROYED PROPERTY AND THEN DOWN

01:56:20.207 --> 01:56:23.743 region:rollup2
THE HILLSIDE YOU SEE ANOTHER

01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:25.645 region:rollup2
DESTROYED PROPERTY.

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.980 region:rollup2
I TALKED ABOUT SAFETY IT'S NOT

01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:28.014 region:rollup2
JUST SAFETY FOR THE PERSON

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:29.416 region:rollup2
RETURNING YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:31.218 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:56:29.416 --> 01:56:33.486 region:rollup2
INTACT HOMES.

01:56:31.218 --> 01:56:35.055 region:rollup2
NEXT TO THE COMPLETELY DESTROYED

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:36.489 region:rollup2
HOMES AND IN SOME CASES AND I

01:56:35.055 --> 01:56:38.024 region:rollup2
MET SOME OF THESE NEIGHBORS ARM

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:39.759 region:rollup2
JUST LAST WEEK. THEY'RE LIVING

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:41.094 region:rollup2
IN THESE HOMES WHILE THERE IS

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:43.129 region:rollup2
DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS GOING

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:44.965 region:rollup2
ON ACROSS THE STREET.

01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:46.833 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO ENGAGE A HIGH

01:56:44.965 --> 01:56:48.568 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF SAFETY.

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:50.737 region:rollup2
AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:52.072 region:rollup2
DUST CONTROL AIR MONITORING TO

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:53.106 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CAUSING

01:56:52.072 --> 01:56:56.910 region:rollup2
ANY HARM TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:58.478 region:rollup2
STILL THERE.

01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:01.114 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T VERY DRAMATIC.

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:01.748 region:rollup2
SITE.

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:02.883 region:rollup2
THE DRIVE NOW WOULD DRIVE WAY TO

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:04.184 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE.

01:57:02.883 --> 01:57:05.952 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A HOME AT THE END OF

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:08.188 region:rollup2
THIS DRIVEWAY.

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:09.456 region:rollup2
IT WAS BUILT ON TO THE HILLSIDE.

01:57:08.188 --> 01:57:11.057 region:rollup2
THE FIRE CAME THROUGH DESTROYED

01:57:09.456 --> 01:57:12.759 region:rollup2
ALL THE MOORINGS AND ALL THE

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:14.461 region:rollup2
PEERS THAT WERE HOLDING THAT UP.

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:16.296 region:rollup2
IF YOU STAND ATOP THAT DRIVEWAY

01:57:14.461 --> 01:57:17.664 region:rollup2
IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTEEN FOOT DROP.

01:57:16.296 --> 01:57:19.866 region:rollup2
AND THEN A FORTY FOOT LEDGE.

01:57:17.664 --> 01:57:21.768 region:rollup2
OF A DESTROYED HOME.

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:23.770 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER LEDGE

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:25.038 region:rollup2
THAT ROLLS DOWN.

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.573 region:rollup2
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE

01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:28.174 region:rollup2
ARE SOME INTACT HOMES AND OUT

01:57:26.573 --> 01:57:31.044 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT OTHERS.

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:34.281 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DRAMATIC.

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:36.283 region:rollup2
EFFECT OF OF WHAT WE SEE THIS

01:57:34.281 --> 01:57:38.051 region:rollup2
IS THE HORRIFYING NATURE.

01:57:36.283 --> 01:57:39.619 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WENT ON.

01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:40.921 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THESE ARE LIVES THESE

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:42.556 region:rollup2
ARE HOMES THESE ARE MEMORIES

01:57:40.921 --> 01:57:45.926 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOW GONE AND AND IT'S

01:57:42.556 --> 01:57:49.863 region:rollup2
HARDFOR USTO. ON NOT DISTANCE

01:57:45.926 --> 01:57:51.431 region:rollup2
OURSELVES FROM FROM THAT.

01:57:49.863 --> 01:57:53.199 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANOTHER SITE THERE IT

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:54.801 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD SOME STEEL FRAME

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:56.870 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

01:57:54.801 --> 01:57:58.572 region:rollup2
AND A CHIMNEY THIS ONE WE HAVE

01:57:56.870 --> 01:58:00.540 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:57:58.572 --> 01:58:02.075 region:rollup2
EVEN BEGUN WE HAVE EVEN ASSESS

01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:04.144 region:rollup2
THE SITE BECAUSE OF THE.

01:58:02.075 --> 01:58:05.979 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY OF THE

01:58:04.144 --> 01:58:07.847 region:rollup2
LEDGE THAT IT'S ON BECAUSE OF

01:58:05.979 --> 01:58:08.682 region:rollup2
THE PRESENT HAZARDS THAT ARE

01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:10.317 region:rollup2
THERE FOR ANY CREW GETTINGON

01:58:08.682 --> 01:58:14.788 region:rollup2
THEIR. THIS IS GOING TO BE A

01:58:10.317 --> 01:58:15.722 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLICATED SITE FOR US.

01:58:14.788 --> 01:58:16.990 region:rollup2
YOU SAW THE DRIVEWAY THAT

01:58:15.722 --> 01:58:18.525 region:rollup2
DROPPED OFF.

01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:20.126 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VIEW FROM JUST DOWN

01:58:18.525 --> 01:58:22.228 region:rollup2
THE STREET.

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:23.964 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO THAT DRIVE WAY AND

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:24.464 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS THE STATE OF OF

01:58:23.964 --> 01:58:25.899 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:28.668 region:rollup2
OUR CREWS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:58:25.899 --> 01:58:30.170 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:31.738 region:rollup2
IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET

01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:32.839 region:rollup2
ANY HEAVY EQUIPMENT IN THERE.

01:58:31.738 --> 01:58:34.608 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ARE CREWS ON THE GROUND

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:38.478 region:rollup2
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW

01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:40.947 region:rollup2
pAND SOME OF THAT MAY HAVE TO BE

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:41.481 region:rollup2
HAND REMOVAL. ON THAT'S A TIMELY

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:43.617 region:rollup2
TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:45.251 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:46.753 region:rollup2
BUT IT HAS TO BE CLEANED YOU CAN

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:48.755 region:rollup2
SEE THE PRESENT HAZARDS OF

01:58:46.753 --> 01:58:50.724 region:rollup2
DAMAGE TREES YOU CAN SEE THE

01:58:48.755 --> 01:58:51.358 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE

01:58:50.724 --> 01:58:52.359 region:rollup2
IN THE FOREGROUND TO THE RIGHT

01:58:51.358 --> 01:58:54.628 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:58:52.359 --> 01:58:55.428 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:58:54.628 --> 01:58:58.598 region:rollup2
THERE'S THEIR HOMES THAT ARE

01:58:55.428 --> 01:59:00.767 region:rollup2
INTACT.

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:03.003 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMPLER.

01:59:00.767 --> 01:59:04.270 region:rollup2
IT'S FLAT BUT.

01:59:03.003 --> 01:59:06.740 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HAZARDS THERE IN TERMS

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:07.841 region:rollup2
OF THE TREES IN TERMS OF THE.

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.477 region:rollup2
SMOKES AT THE CHIMNEYS.

01:59:07.841 --> 01:59:12.479 region:rollup2
.

01:59:10.477 --> 01:59:13.446 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE A LITTLE SIMPLER FOR

01:59:12.479 --> 01:59:15.382 region:rollup2
US BUT AGAIN DOES THAT IS THE

01:59:13.446 --> 01:59:16.783 region:rollup2
BUT THE WIDE VARIETY AND RANGE

01:59:15.382 --> 01:59:18.184 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THIS

01:59:16.783 --> 01:59:19.252 region:rollup2
IS THAT SIMPLY AN AIR MONITOR

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.887 region:rollup2
THESE ARE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:22.155 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:23.456 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ARE FLOATING

01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:24.124 region:rollup2
AROUND IN THE AIR AND THAT

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:26.192 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:59:24.124 --> 01:59:28.061 region:rollup2
MEASURED. AND THAT SIGNAGE THERE

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:29.896 region:rollup2
PUT BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:59:28.061 --> 01:59:32.032 region:rollup2
WARNING PEOPLE OF THE SITE. THIS

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:33.867 region:rollup2
IS A TYPICAL OPERATION.

01:59:32.032 --> 01:59:35.702 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT.

01:59:33.867 --> 01:59:37.003 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE CREW MEMBER MEMBER.

01:59:35.702 --> 01:59:38.738 region:rollup2
IN THE WHITE TIE VICKI HAS A

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:40.840 region:rollup2
RESPIRATOR HARD HAT HE IS FULLY

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:42.275 region:rollup2
PROTECTED.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.977 region:rollup2
THE CREW MEMBER AT THE FRONT

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:45.478 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE MONITOR. IS KIND OF

01:59:43.977 --> 01:59:48.648 region:rollup2
WATCHING THE THE PROGRESS

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:50.784 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTING IT.

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:52.686 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WATER TRUCK ADJUST TO

01:59:50.784 --> 01:59:54.487 region:rollup2
THE LEFT OF THE BACK OF THEIR TO

01:59:52.686 --> 01:59:56.289 region:rollup2
KEEP DUST CONTROL.

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.956 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT THE BLUE TENTED

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:58.425 region:rollup2
AREA THERE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED

01:59:56.956 --> 02:00:00.427 region:rollup2
THE DECONTAMINATION ARE IN NO

01:59:58.425 --> 02:00:01.695 region:rollup2
ONE LEAVES THAT SITE.

02:00:00.427 --> 02:00:03.530 region:rollup2
WITHOUT TAKING OFF ALL OF THEIR

02:00:01.695 --> 02:00:04.998 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT A WITHIN

02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:05.832 region:rollup2
THAT AND LEAVING THAT BEHIND

02:00:04.998 --> 02:00:07.700 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO WHAT'S CALLED

02:00:05.832 --> 02:00:08.535 region:rollup2
EXCLUSION ZONE A RED ZONE WHERE

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:10.970 region:rollup2
NO ONE WHO.

02:00:08.535 --> 02:00:12.439 region:rollup2
IS ALLOWED INTO THAT UNLESS

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:15.575 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WEARING THE APPROPRIATE

02:00:12.439 --> 02:00:16.176 region:rollup2
THAT THE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT.

02:00:15.575 --> 02:00:17.644 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHAT REMAINS WHEN

02:00:16.176 --> 02:00:19.813 region:rollup2
WE'RE DONE.

02:00:17.644 --> 02:00:20.046 region:rollup2
THIS IS A CLEAR PARCEL. IN FACT

02:00:19.813 --> 02:00:20.947 region:rollup2
THEIR.

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:22.415 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE ANY.

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:24.350 region:rollup2
.

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:26.753 region:rollup2
TEST FLAG SO THAT THIS SOIL HAS

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:28.088 region:rollup2
BEEN CLEARED THIS SITE IS READY

02:00:26.753 --> 02:00:30.490 region:rollup2
UPON TO BE RETURNED TO THE

02:00:28.088 --> 02:00:31.858 region:rollup2
RESIDENT. AND READY TO REBUILD

02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:34.260 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT WE DO LEAVE

02:00:31.858 --> 02:00:36.262 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THINGS BEHIND ON WALLS

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.230 region:rollup2
AND AND OTHER OTHER ASPECTS OF

02:00:36.262 --> 02:00:38.665 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE THAT THOSE CAUSE

02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:40.700 region:rollup2
GREATER HARM TO THE NATURAL

02:00:38.665 --> 02:00:42.402 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE AND AND INCREASED

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:44.838 region:rollup2
COSTS UNNECESSARILY.

02:00:42.402 --> 02:00:45.472 region:rollup2
IF WE REMOVE DOZENS OR VERY

02:00:44.838 --> 02:00:45.672 region:rollup2
JUDICIOUS IN HOW WE TAKE THINGS

02:00:45.472 --> 02:00:47.707 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:00:45.672 --> 02:00:49.542 region:rollup2
.

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:51.077 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S MY PRESENTATION.

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:52.412 region:rollup2
I INCLUDED THIS PICTURE OF A

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:53.513 region:rollup2
BOGAN VIA BECAUSE WHILE WE WERE

02:00:52.412 --> 02:00:55.215 region:rollup2
THERE WE WERE SEEING LIFE

02:00:53.513 --> 02:00:56.149 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RETURNING. AND SO I

02:00:55.215 --> 02:00:58.818 region:rollup2
WANTED TO END THIS ON A VERY

02:00:56.149 --> 02:01:02.589 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC NOTE.

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:03.490 region:rollup2
AND TURNED TO DOCTOR PACKAGE.

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:06.860 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:08.461 region:rollup2
DUCK PERCHED.

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:12.532 region:rollup2
IT'S GUERRA OF RUNNING A LITTLE

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:13.466 region:rollup2
BIT LATE. BRIEF YES I'M ALRIGHT

02:01:12.532 --> 02:01:15.001 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T. BOB.

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:17.804 region:rollup2
WELL WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FINISH

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:20.774 region:rollup2
THIS BY NOON AND HAVE US A THREE

02:01:17.804 --> 02:01:22.108 region:rollup2
MORE SPEAKERS AFTER THIS.

02:01:20.774 --> 02:01:38.491 region:rollup2
TO GIVE EVERYBODY A SENSE OF

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:38.491 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR TIME FRAME HAS

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:43.463 region:rollup2
.

THE MORNING F. PERMANENTLY. PLUG

02:01:43.463 --> 02:01:47.167 region:rollup2
JOHN PARISH STATE GEOLOGIST AYE

02:01:45.832 --> 02:01:48.735 region:rollup2
I WILL.

02:01:47.167 --> 02:01:50.603 region:rollup2
HIS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE HERE IN

02:01:48.735 --> 02:01:51.070 region:rollup2
THE UNDERSTAND THAT WERE

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.272 region:rollup2
WONDERED AT THAT TIME

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:54.674 region:rollup2
RESTRAINTS.

02:01:52.272 --> 02:01:55.275 region:rollup2
PARDON MY BACK IF I TURN AROUND

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.643 region:rollup2
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE.

WELL IN THIS.

02:01:56.643 --> 02:02:00.346 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT?

02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:01.815 region:rollup2
ON WON'T GIVE YOU. A BRIEF

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:03.283 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF WHAT TO THE DEBRIS

02:02:01.815 --> 02:02:04.551 region:rollup2
FLOWS OF MONEY FLOWS ARE AND HOW

02:02:03.283 --> 02:02:05.885 region:rollup2
THEY START AND WHY THEY GET

02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:07.353 region:rollup2
VICIOUS.

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:09.823 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:10.924 region:rollup2
THESE ARE OF COURSE ISN'T THAT

02:02:09.823 --> 02:02:12.525 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE CALIFORNIA'S

02:02:10.924 --> 02:02:14.327 region:rollup2
OTHER GREAT.

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:15.495 region:rollup2
HAZARDS WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT

02:02:14.327 --> 02:02:16.796 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE TALK ABOUT

02:02:15.495 --> 02:02:19.299 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKES.

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:21.000 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE AND US TSUNAMIS AND

02:02:19.299 --> 02:02:21.968 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT WILL.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.938 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE SOME OTHER.

02:02:21.968 --> 02:02:26.639 region:rollup2
GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS IN STATE AND

02:02:24.938 --> 02:02:27.807 region:rollup2
TO WE'VE HAD THEM FOR QUITE SOME

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:29.142 region:rollup2
TIME BUT I WON'T BORE YOU WITH

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:31.811 region:rollup2
TO TWELVE MILLION YEARS OF

02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:32.278 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF THESE. PARTICULAR ONE

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:32.612 region:rollup2
SINCE WERE UNDER TIME

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:36.716 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS.

02:02:32.612 --> 02:02:38.084 region:rollup2
.

02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:41.654 region:rollup2
OF THEIR OWN.

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:42.689 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE OPEN.

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:44.023 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT.

02:02:42.689 --> 02:02:44.591 region:rollup2
PAPA.

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:46.092 region:rollup2
GOING TO WRITE.

02:02:44.591 --> 02:02:51.698 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:52.665 region:rollup2
PAGE.

02:02:51.698 --> 02:02:54.467 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE TYPE OF DEBRIS

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:56.269 region:rollup2
FLOWS THAT OF THAT WE ENCOUNTER

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:58.271 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE IN THEIR THEIR OLD

02:02:56.269 --> 02:03:00.206 region:rollup2
REPOSE BUT THERE'S. THE ROCK

02:02:58.271 --> 02:03:02.242 region:rollup2
FALL POST FIRE DEBRIS FLOWS

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:04.010 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT ALLUVIAL FANS THAT

02:03:02.242 --> 02:03:05.445 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THAT ARE ALL BUILT OUT

02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:07.013 region:rollup2
LONGER. MOUNTAIN FRONTS.

02:03:05.445 --> 02:03:09.015 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S THE FLOOD

02:03:07.013 --> 02:03:11.017 region:rollup2
PLAINS THAT WE SEE THESE FLOWS A

02:03:09.015 --> 02:03:13.353 region:rollup2
DUMPING INTO. THESE ARE ALL

02:03:11.017 --> 02:03:15.755 region:rollup2
NATURALLY OCCURRING ó WITH IN

02:03:13.353 --> 02:03:17.523 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THEY ALL OCCUR TO

02:03:15.755 --> 02:03:20.493 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS DEGREES DEPENDING ON

02:03:17.523 --> 02:03:21.327 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S A FIRE. THAT HAS

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:23.896 region:rollup2
AFFECTED THOSE AREAS.

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:25.899 region:rollup2
A FIRE IN THE AREA MAGNIFIES THE

02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:28.134 region:rollup2
INTENSITY OF THOSE DEBRIS FLOWS

02:03:25.899 --> 02:03:29.669 region:rollup2
IN MUD FLOWS. OF THE HUNDREDS

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:32.772 region:rollup2
AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:34.240 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THESE TEND TO OCCUR

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:36.409 region:rollup2
NATURALLY.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:41.748 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GET A HEAVY RAINSTORM

02:03:36.409 --> 02:03:43.716 region:rollup2
IN OF SOME OF THESE AREAS.

02:03:41.748 --> 02:03:44.317 region:rollup2
VIDEO POPULATION VULNERABILITIES

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:46.786 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING IN

02:03:44.317 --> 02:03:49.289 region:rollup2
TO.

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:50.790 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE AFFECTED AREAS

02:03:49.289 --> 02:03:52.692 region:rollup2
OTHER WE'RE NOT HAZARDS UNTIL WE

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:55.428 region:rollup2
BUILT OUR OUR COMMUNITIES UP

02:03:52.692 --> 02:03:57.830 region:rollup2
INTO THE AREAS. AND OF THE

02:03:55.428 --> 02:04:00.400 region:rollup2
SEQUENCE OF FIRE AND RAIN.

02:03:57.830 --> 02:04:03.269 region:rollup2
HAS ENHANCED THE OF THE

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.903 region:rollup2
CRITICALITY AND THE INTENSITY OF

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:05.471 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.839 region:rollup2
DAMAGES WHEN THEY OCCUR BUT

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:07.907 region:rollup2
THIS IS NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:10.376 region:rollup2
MONTROSE.

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:12.312 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR AWAY FROM

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:20.553 region:rollup2
THE CANYON MOUTH. A LOT OF

02:04:12.312 --> 02:04:22.422 region:rollup2
DEBRIS HAS COME IN THESE AREAS.

02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:23.990 region:rollup2
WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF WILDFIRES

02:04:22.422 --> 02:04:26.426 region:rollup2
AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY AND

02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:27.760 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OCCURRING IN AND AROUND

02:04:26.426 --> 02:04:31.464 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.598 region:rollup2
WHAT THESE FIRES DO IS?

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:34.467 region:rollup2
FATE WHEN THEY BURN ACROSS THE

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:37.437 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE IS THEY ACTUALLY

02:04:34.467 --> 02:04:39.005 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE SOILS. O. WE BURN OFF

02:04:37.437 --> 02:04:40.707 region:rollup2
THE BRUSH WE BURNED THE THE

02:04:39.005 --> 02:04:42.275 region:rollup2
TREES BECAUSE THE BRUSH IS VERY

02:04:40.707 --> 02:04:44.944 region:rollup2
INTENSE AND. THESE TWO INTENSE

02:04:42.275 --> 02:04:47.347 region:rollup2
FIRES WE TALKED TO GET OILS IN

02:04:44.944 --> 02:04:48.614 region:rollup2
THE IN THE SOIL AS WELL AS THE

02:04:47.347 --> 02:04:50.383 region:rollup2
ROOTS.

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:54.320 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND GIVE SOME OILS AND

02:04:50.383 --> 02:04:56.823 region:rollup2
THE SOILS THEMSELVES TEND TO.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:59.192 region:rollup2
UNDERGO CHEMICAL CHANGES AND WE

02:04:56.823 --> 02:05:00.560 region:rollup2
GET OZONEIN THERE CALLED A

02:04:59.192 --> 02:05:01.894 region:rollup2
HYDROPHOBIC STONE.

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.629 region:rollup2
THAT'S OWN IS IMPERMEABLE TO

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:05.465 region:rollup2
WATER.

02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:07.934 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE GET THESE INTENSE

02:05:05.465 --> 02:05:10.436 region:rollup2
RAINS AFTERWARD THE WATER IS NO

02:05:07.934 --> 02:05:12.438 region:rollup2
LONGER ABSORB INTO THE GROUND.

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:14.407 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BREAK UP

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:16.609 region:rollup2
IT'S RUNOFF ON THE SURFACE OF

02:05:14.407 --> 02:05:16.776 region:rollup2
THE GROUND SO WE GET THESE GREAT

02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:19.112 region:rollup2
TO.

02:05:16.776 --> 02:05:21.147 region:rollup2
TORRENTS OF WATER OF FROM VERY

02:05:19.112 --> 02:05:24.016 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE RAINFALLS AS THAT

02:05:21.147 --> 02:05:25.318 region:rollup2
WATER. RUNS OFF THE GROUND IT

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:26.886 region:rollup2
STARTS PICKING UP EVERYTHING IN

02:05:25.318 --> 02:05:30.023 region:rollup2
ITS PATH.

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:31.257 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE INCHES OF WATER

02:05:30.023 --> 02:05:31.758 region:rollup2
MOVING AT THIRTY MILES AN HOUR

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:33.292 region:rollup2
WILL WILL PICK UP A SEMI

02:05:31.758 --> 02:05:35.061 region:rollup2
TRAILER.

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:36.562 region:rollup2
AND MOVE IT.

02:05:35.061 --> 02:05:38.664 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE BURN

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:41.034 region:rollup2
AREA LIKE WE'VE HAD HERE IN THE

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:42.502 region:rollup2
ABOVE MONTH ACETO WE SEE A

02:05:41.034 --> 02:05:44.237 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WATER

02:05:42.502 --> 02:05:45.938 region:rollup2
RUNNING DOWN THE CANYONS AND

02:05:44.237 --> 02:05:48.541 region:rollup2
IT'S PICKING UP EVERY PIECE OF

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:50.243 region:rollup2
DEBRIS. CAN AND IN COLLECTING

02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:53.579 region:rollup2
YET UNTIL JUST THE MOUTH OF THE

02:05:50.243 --> 02:05:55.515 region:rollup2
CANYON AND THEN IT'S IT SPREADS.

02:05:53.579 --> 02:06:00.586 region:rollup2
OUT OVER THE.

02:05:55.515 --> 02:06:01.721 region:rollup2
THE LANDING ZONE.

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:03.656 region:rollup2
BULLETS LOOK GOOD CALIFORNIA

02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:05.558 region:rollup2
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DOES IS WE ARE

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:08.227 region:rollup2
TASKED BY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

02:06:05.558 --> 02:06:09.796 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND AND CAL FIRE.

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:11.197 region:rollup2
TO GO OUT.

02:06:09.796 --> 02:06:12.632 region:rollup2
OFTEN WHEN THE GROUND IS STILL

02:06:11.197 --> 02:06:15.735 region:rollup2
HOT

02:06:12.632 --> 02:06:17.970 region:rollup2
AND MAP THE EXTENT OF THE FIRE.

02:06:15.735 --> 02:06:20.573 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS SAMPLE THE GROUNDS OF

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:22.575 region:rollup2
THE HERE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF.

02:06:20.573 --> 02:06:23.876 region:rollup2
HA HYDROPHOBIC SOILS MIGHT BE

02:06:22.575 --> 02:06:25.545 region:rollup2
THERE TO WHAT DEGREES OF THESE

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:28.448 region:rollup2
EXIST.

02:06:25.545 --> 02:06:30.283 region:rollup2
AND TO.

02:06:28.448 --> 02:06:33.486 region:rollup2
MAP WHAT WE CALL.

02:06:30.283 --> 02:06:35.655 region:rollup2
OF VALUE AT RISK AREAS.

02:06:33.486 --> 02:06:37.523 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE DATA ARE WE DOING

02:06:35.655 --> 02:06:39.025 region:rollup2
THIS ON A VERY SHORT TIME. WE

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:40.726 region:rollup2
WORK ABOUT FOURTEEN HOUR DAYS

02:06:39.025 --> 02:06:41.994 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD TO EVERYONE FROM FIVE

02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:43.763 region:rollup2
OF OUR OFFICES IN THE FIELDS TO

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:46.799 region:rollup2
DO THIS.

02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:48.568 region:rollup2
THAT DATA IS SENT BY FIELD

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:49.969 region:rollup2
COMPUTER IT STREAM TO OUR

02:06:48.568 --> 02:06:52.171 region:rollup2
HEADQUARTERS WERE.

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:54.540 region:rollup2
WE HAVE GIS CREWS WHO PUT ALL

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:56.175 region:rollup2
THAT DATA TOGETHER AND STREAM IT

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.810 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE FIELD SO THAT

02:06:56.175 --> 02:07:00.213 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAS ALL THE DATA THAT

02:06:57.810 --> 02:07:01.814 region:rollup2
THERE. OF SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

02:07:00.213 --> 02:07:03.216 region:rollup2
AND HAS ALL THAT IN FRONT OF

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:05.251 region:rollup2
THEM FOR THE DECISION MAKERS TO

02:07:03.216 --> 02:07:08.120 region:rollup2
USE.

02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:10.089 region:rollup2
OF WE ALSO WORK WITH THE USGS

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:12.024 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:12.258 region:rollup2
MODEL AND EXPLAIN WHERE ALL OF

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:13.159 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:15.595 region:rollup2
.

02:07:13.159 --> 02:07:17.797 region:rollup2
THE DANGER IS GOING TO BE THE

02:07:15.595 --> 02:07:19.765 region:rollup2
IDEA OF DOING THIS IS TO TRIAGE

02:07:17.797 --> 02:07:21.334 region:rollup2
THE DAMAGE.

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:22.602 region:rollup2
SO THAT

02:07:21.334 --> 02:07:25.037 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE

02:07:22.602 --> 02:07:27.240 region:rollup2
RAINFALL IN TWELVE HOURS IS WAS

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:28.975 region:rollup2
OCCURRING HERE. THE ENGINEERS

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:31.010 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TIME TO COME IN AND

02:07:28.975 --> 02:07:33.513 region:rollup2
BUILD DEFENSES AGAINST.

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:35.915 region:rollup2
DEBRIS FLOWS THAT MAY BE COMING

02:07:33.513 --> 02:07:37.383 region:rollup2
LATER SEVERAL WEEKS WE HOPE FOR

02:07:35.915 --> 02:07:40.453 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER.

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:43.389 region:rollup2
TO DEFLECT OF THE DEBRIS FLOWS

02:07:40.453 --> 02:07:45.358 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE ESTABLISHMENTS AND

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:46.826 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE TRIAGE THAT IS DONE.

02:07:45.358 --> 02:07:48.494 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE WE SEE IN MONTICELLO

02:07:46.826 --> 02:07:50.329 region:rollup2
WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE HOURS WORTH

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:52.498 region:rollup2
OF TRIAGE TO DO IT JUST WASN'T

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:56.369 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY TO GET.

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:58.171 region:rollup2
ANYTHING DONE THERE.

02:07:56.369 --> 02:07:59.739 region:rollup2
THEN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S AN

02:07:58.171 --> 02:08:02.575 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WITH A HOUSE THAT.

02:07:59.739 --> 02:08:05.044 region:rollup2
IS CONVENIENTLY BILLED BELOW A

02:08:02.575 --> 02:08:07.580 region:rollup2
CANYON OR THAT SO OF BEEN BURNED

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:10.316 region:rollup2
A BIT AND THAT IS A HIGH RISK.

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.883 region:rollup2
OF HOME RIGHT THERE THAT IS

02:08:10.316 --> 02:08:12.585 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO WITH THE DEBRIS

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:14.253 region:rollup2
FLOW.

02:08:12.585 --> 02:08:15.955 region:rollup2
AND DOWNED ON THE LOWER PICTURE

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:16.522 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE. THE

02:08:15.955 --> 02:08:19.825 region:rollup2
VARS THE VA ARE REAL THROUGH

02:08:16.522 --> 02:08:21.894 region:rollup2
THE.

02:08:19.825 --> 02:08:23.496 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:26.165 region:rollup2
THAT'S REAL FOURTH REAL FIVE. M.

02:08:23.496 --> 02:08:28.234 region:rollup2
OF THOSE HOUSES WERE BUILT.

02:08:26.165 --> 02:08:30.670 region:rollup2
IN THE BASE OF OPINION THAT

02:08:28.234 --> 02:08:32.438 region:rollup2
CANYON HAS NOW BURNED AND WE'RE

02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:34.774 region:rollup2
MAPPING THAT AREA TO SAY THIS IS

02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:36.509 region:rollup2
AN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH RISK AREA.

02:08:34.774 --> 02:08:37.743 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS ANY RAIN THAT'S

02:08:36.509 --> 02:08:39.879 region:rollup2
DROPPED ON IT BECAUSE THERE'S

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:41.447 region:rollup2
LOOSE LAND FILL UP WITH TOP.

02:08:39.879 --> 02:08:42.682 region:rollup2
AN INDIAN INDEED.

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:45.184 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS.

02:08:42.682 --> 02:08:46.652 region:rollup2
THAT IT RAIN HERE THOSE HOUSES

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:47.954 region:rollup2
WILL GO IN THIS PROBABLY NO

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:49.922 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING WAY TO SAVE THEM

02:08:47.954 --> 02:08:51.290 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT LONGER DRY

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:52.925 region:rollup2
SPELL WHERE YOU CAN PLANT

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:54.360 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ON THE SIDES OF THE

02:08:52.925 --> 02:08:58.898 region:rollup2
HILLS TO TRY TO.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:00.433 region:rollup2
OF HELP THESE AREAS.

02:08:58.898 --> 02:09:03.069 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST SOME PICTURES THAT

02:09:00.433 --> 02:09:04.470 region:rollup2
WE SEE DEBRIS FLOWS THESE.

02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:07.106 region:rollup2
THIS ARE THE ONES AND THEN BONTA

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:09.208 region:rollup2
SETO ND YOU CAN SEE. THE SIZE

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:11.544 region:rollup2
OF THE ROCKS IN THE CARS IN THE

02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:12.812 region:rollup2
TREES THOSE ROCKS WAY FOUR

02:09:11.544 --> 02:09:14.113 region:rollup2
THOUSAND POUNDS

02:09:12.812 --> 02:09:15.281 region:rollup2
CAR WEIGHS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:18.084 region:rollup2
POUNDS.

02:09:15.281 --> 02:09:20.453 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THESE WERE FOUND

02:09:18.084 --> 02:09:22.288 region:rollup2
TWENTY FEET UP IN TREES.

02:09:20.453 --> 02:09:23.656 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE DEBRIS FLOWS CAME OUT

02:09:22.288 --> 02:09:25.825 region:rollup2
OF THE CANYONS WHERE THEY WERE

02:09:23.656 --> 02:09:28.494 region:rollup2
CONFINED. THEY WERE TWENTY FIVE

02:09:25.825 --> 02:09:31.097 region:rollup2
TO THIRTY FIVE FEET HIGH.

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:32.198 region:rollup2
S. BEFORE THEY SPREAD AND SO

02:09:31.097 --> 02:09:34.634 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF.

02:09:32.198 --> 02:09:36.402 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWELVE MILES AN HOUR OF A

02:09:34.634 --> 02:09:38.404 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOOT WALL OF DEBRIS

02:09:36.402 --> 02:09:39.905 region:rollup2
HITTING. THE DEBRIS IS WHAT DOES

02:09:38.404 --> 02:09:41.774 region:rollup2
THE DAMAGE MORE SO THAN THE

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:42.975 region:rollup2
WATER BECAUSE THE DEBRIS. TEARS

02:09:41.774 --> 02:09:44.510 region:rollup2
DOWN BUILDINGS WHEN IT CRASHES

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:45.611 region:rollup2
INTO THEM.

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.712 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT DOES

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:53.152 region:rollup2
SWEEPS THE STREETS CLEAN OF

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:55.288 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING.

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:56.789 region:rollup2
HERE ARE MUDFLOWS NOW VIS

02:09:55.288 --> 02:09:58.724 region:rollup2
THIS HYDROPHOBIC ZONE IN THE

02:09:56.789 --> 02:10:01.160 region:rollup2
SOIL.

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:03.462 region:rollup2
IS NOT REMOVED AFTER THE FIRST

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:04.930 region:rollup2
HEAVY DEBRIS FLOW IN FACT THESE

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:06.599 region:rollup2
HYDROPHOBIC ZONES CAN LAST

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:08.634 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

02:10:06.599 --> 02:10:10.603 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS AFTER YOU

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:12.104 region:rollup2
CLEAN OUT THE ROUGH DEBRIS YOU

02:10:10.603 --> 02:10:13.139 region:rollup2
MAY START CLEANING OUT MUD FLOWS

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:16.142 region:rollup2
LATER ON.

02:10:13.139 --> 02:10:18.344 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DEBRIS IS GONE BUT

02:10:16.142 --> 02:10:19.879 region:rollup2
YOU'RE STILL A ROADIE OF THE

02:10:18.344 --> 02:10:21.747 region:rollup2
SURFACE AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE

02:10:19.879 --> 02:10:23.282 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS MUDFLOWS.

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:24.850 region:rollup2
COME DOWN AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.751 region:rollup2
BOTTOM HERE THAT NEAR

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:28.621 region:rollup2
BAKERSFIELD.

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:30.256 region:rollup2
THERE'S A A SEMI TRAILER THE

02:10:28.621 --> 02:10:32.758 region:rollup2
AND THE HIGHWAY WAS JUST BURIED.

02:10:30.256 --> 02:10:34.660 region:rollup2
SO THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST AND.

02:10:32.758 --> 02:10:36.028 region:rollup2
WITH WITHOUT WARNING AND YOU

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:37.730 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:39.765 region:rollup2
NEAR A A.

02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:41.967 region:rollup2
A BURN ZONE YOU CAN BE MILES

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:48.674 region:rollup2
AWAY AND STILL HAVE THESE TAKING

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:50.509 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:52.278 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF COURSE THOUGH IT ONE

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:54.046 region:rollup2
OF THESE OTHERS IS ROCK FALLS OF

02:10:52.278 --> 02:10:55.414 region:rollup2
INTENSE WATER GETS IN THE JOINTS

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:57.917 region:rollup2
OF ROCKS THAT UNDERCUTS THE

02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:59.018 region:rollup2
CLIFFS AND YOU HAVE THESE GIANT

02:10:57.917 --> 02:11:01.253 region:rollup2
ROCK FALLS THAT OCCUR.

02:10:59.018 --> 02:11:03.189 region:rollup2
IF THE ROCK FALL OCCURS IN THE

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:04.824 region:rollup2
EVENING. OWE YOU HAVE THESE

02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:05.558 region:rollup2
BOULDERS GOING TO A THREE

02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:07.760 region:rollup2
THOUSAND POUNDS OUT ON THE

02:11:05.558 --> 02:11:08.828 region:rollup2
STREETS AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.130 region:rollup2
FOR NIGHT DRIVING DOWN THE

02:11:08.828 --> 02:11:13.265 region:rollup2
HIGHWAY CITY CRASH INTO THESE.

02:11:11.130 --> 02:11:14.934 region:rollup2
OTHERS THIS THE POOR PERSON IN

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:16.635 region:rollup2
THE CAR IN THE PHOTO BELOW IS

02:11:14.934 --> 02:11:19.138 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SWEPT OFF THE ROAD BY

02:11:16.635 --> 02:11:20.306 region:rollup2
ROCK FALL IN AND KILLED IN THAT

02:11:19.138 --> 02:11:21.807 region:rollup2
THE OF CURRENT.

02:11:20.306 --> 02:11:23.976 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE VERY.

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:28.814 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE.

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:31.450 region:rollup2
EVENTS THAT OCCUR.

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:33.352 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY LLUVIAL FANS NOW

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:34.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VERY LARGE ALLUVIAL

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:37.056 region:rollup2
FAN DOWN INYO COUNTY.

02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:39.158 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A DEGREE FLOW THAT

02:11:37.056 --> 02:11:41.427 region:rollup2
STARTED FIVE AND A HALF MILES

02:11:39.158 --> 02:11:43.028 region:rollup2
AWAY AT THE CANYON.

02:11:41.427 --> 02:11:45.331 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DID TO SPREAD OUT OVER

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:46.432 region:rollup2
THAT ALLUVIAL FAN AND DOWN LORD

02:11:45.331 --> 02:11:48.100 region:rollup2
RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE MOUNT

02:11:46.432 --> 02:11:49.635 region:rollup2
WHITNEY OF FISH HATCHERY THAT

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:51.904 region:rollup2
WAS DESTROYED BY THIS FIVE MILES

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:53.439 region:rollup2
AWAY?

02:11:51.904 --> 02:11:56.275 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE KIND OF THINGS THAT

02:11:53.439 --> 02:11:57.676 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE NOTE OF BECAUSE.

02:11:56.275 --> 02:12:00.012 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO PLAN OUR

02:11:57.676 --> 02:12:02.381 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO PLAN THEM

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:04.550 region:rollup2
TO MITIGATE FOR THESE TYPES OF

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:05.785 region:rollup2
DISASTERS THAT OCCUR.

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:06.652 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF.

02:12:05.785 --> 02:12:08.954 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT GOING ON IN

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:11.724 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BUILD ON

02:12:08.954 --> 02:12:13.125 region:rollup2
THESE ALLUVIAL FANS AND BECAUSE

02:12:11.724 --> 02:12:15.828 region:rollup2
THEY SAY IT'S DESERT AND IT'S

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:17.229 region:rollup2
DRY. WILL IT MAY BE BUT IT RAINS

02:12:15.828 --> 02:12:18.164 region:rollup2
IN THE HILLS AND YOU GET THESE

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:20.332 region:rollup2
ALLUVIAL.

02:12:18.164 --> 02:12:21.834 region:rollup2
WASHES THAT COME OUT BUILDING

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:24.069 region:rollup2
THE FANS.

02:12:21.834 --> 02:12:27.907 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE'S A NOTE THAT THAT.

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:28.340 region:rollup2
CGS HAS TO TAKE AWAY FROM FEES

02:12:27.907 --> 02:12:31.076 region:rollup2
IT'S TO INFORM LOCAL

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:33.846 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:35.014 region:rollup2
TO REBUILD WISELY AND SAFELY AND

02:12:33.846 --> 02:12:36.949 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGEABLE THE.

02:12:35.014 --> 02:12:40.019 region:rollup2
USING THE BEST ENGINEERING

02:12:36.949 --> 02:12:40.019 region:rollup2
METHODS TO MITIGATE SOME OF

02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:44.356 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS OF.

02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:45.324 region:rollup2
DEBRIS FLOWS THAT OCCUR SO THAT

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:47.593 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THEM OCCURRING

02:12:45.324 --> 02:12:49.595 region:rollup2
AGAIN TAKING LIVES AND COSTING.

02:12:47.593 --> 02:12:52.431 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN AND.

02:12:49.595 --> 02:12:54.533 region:rollup2
IN PROPERTY AS WELL AS BUSINESS.

02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:57.002 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:58.637 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HAVE WERE A WELL. WELL

02:12:57.002 --> 02:13:01.073 region:rollup2
BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT.

02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:02.274 region:rollup2
WILL TRY TAKE COMPLIMENTS FOR

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:04.710 region:rollup2
FOR QUESTIONS AND IF YOU COULD

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:06.745 region:rollup2
TO KEEP YOUR QUESTIONS AND TO

02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:08.347 region:rollup2
THE ANSWERS AS CONCISE AS

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:10.616 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE PRECIADO.

02:13:08.347 --> 02:13:12.117 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTION OF COURSE I'VE GOT

02:13:10.616 --> 02:13:13.485 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED BUT JUST TO THE LAST

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:16.489 region:rollup2
ONE. UP ONE IS THAT MY

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:17.423 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN JAPAN

02:13:16.489 --> 02:13:19.425 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

02:13:17.423 --> 02:13:20.960 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC A WEATHER EVENTS AND

02:13:19.425 --> 02:13:22.595 region:rollup2
HAVE CREATED SOME KIND OF A

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:23.762 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT.

02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:26.298 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:28.267 region:rollup2
FOR WHERE AFTER FIRE THAN THEY

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:30.970 region:rollup2
HAVE A MUD FLOW THAT OCCURS THAT

02:13:28.267 --> 02:13:33.539 region:rollup2
THAT ESSENTIALLY FORCES THAT THE

02:13:30.970 --> 02:13:35.374 region:rollup2
DEBRIS IF YOU WILL TO GO DOWN

02:13:33.539 --> 02:13:37.476 region:rollup2
LOW ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE.

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:40.512 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO COME BACK UP. AND

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:43.015 region:rollup2
TO DESTROY AREAS OF OF THAT YOU

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:44.516 region:rollup2
KNOW. COMMUNITIES AND SO FORTH.

02:13:43.015 --> 02:13:46.285 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:48.254 region:rollup2
HERE IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD

02:13:46.285 --> 02:13:50.289 region:rollup2
DO AS WE TRY TO REBUILD SOME OF

02:13:48.254 --> 02:13:52.358 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS. AS WE DEAL WITH THE

02:13:50.289 --> 02:13:54.393 region:rollup2
DENUDED HILLSIDE TO NORTHERN

02:13:52.358 --> 02:13:57.096 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A DENUDED

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:58.964 region:rollup2
HILLSIDES. IN ABOUT MANSIO IN

02:13:57.096 --> 02:14:00.432 region:rollup2
ALL HIGH AND ON ON THE FREEWAY

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:02.668 region:rollup2
THE ONE A ONE FREEWAY.

02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:04.370 region:rollup2
WHERE JUST SOME RAIN COULD

02:14:02.668 --> 02:14:05.471 region:rollup2
BRING THEM ALL DOWN TO WE HAVE

02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:07.339 region:rollup2
ANY SORT OF CONTAINMENT

02:14:05.471 --> 02:14:08.707 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT ARE LIKE

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:10.676 region:rollup2
CULVERTS BUT? THAT ARE MORE

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:12.044 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC SIMILAR TO WHAT I

02:14:10.676 --> 02:14:13.479 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THEY USE IN JAPAN IF

02:14:12.044 --> 02:14:15.381 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CERTAIN AS DRAMATIC AS

02:14:13.479 --> 02:14:18.117 region:rollup2
JAPAN'S BUT WE DO HAVE COLBERT'S

02:14:15.381 --> 02:14:18.684 region:rollup2
A OF WE DO HAVE A CONTAINMENT

02:14:18.117 --> 02:14:20.019 region:rollup2
DOME.

02:14:18.684 --> 02:14:22.087 region:rollup2
BASINS THAT.

02:14:20.019 --> 02:14:23.355 region:rollup2
MANY COMMUNITIES BUILD I DON'T

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:24.423 region:rollup2
THINK THE CONTAINMENT SO THAT

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:26.625 region:rollup2
THEY HAD HERE WOULD'VE STOPPED

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:27.927 region:rollup2
VIS ENTIRELY BUT THEIR WORK

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:30.896 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT.

02:14:27.927 --> 02:14:31.630 region:rollup2
AREAS THERE THAT DID FILL RIGHT

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:33.933 region:rollup2
AWAY.

02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:34.934 region:rollup2
BUT THE FLOOD WAS JUST TOO MUCH

02:14:33.933 --> 02:14:36.735 region:rollup2
TO FOR THESE.

02:14:34.934 --> 02:14:39.104 region:rollup2
THE OTHER IS.

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:41.340 region:rollup2
WE DO A LOT OF OF WATERSHED OF

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:43.075 region:rollup2
WORK AND WE NEVER RECOMMEND

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:45.444 region:rollup2
CULVERTS.

02:14:43.075 --> 02:14:48.180 region:rollup2
BECAUSE COLBERT'S TEND TO JAM WE

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:50.349 region:rollup2
ALWAYS RECOMMEND BRIDGES.

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.784 region:rollup2
ACROSS OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE

02:14:50.349 --> 02:14:53.819 region:rollup2
COURSE IN LAYING A CULVERT BUT

02:14:51.784 --> 02:14:55.321 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PHOTOS WHERE THE DEBRIS

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:57.957 region:rollup2
HAS SIMPLY JAMMED INTO THE

02:14:55.321 --> 02:14:58.557 region:rollup2
CULVERT. AND THEN THE FOLLOWING

02:14:57.957 --> 02:15:01.093 region:rollup2
TO BREED JUST GOES OVER THE

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:03.562 region:rollup2
ROADS. HOWEVER IF YOU BUILD

02:15:01.093 --> 02:15:04.830 region:rollup2
BRIDGES ACROSS.

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:06.031 region:rollup2
FIFTH THE PRETENSE THAT FLOWS

02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:07.499 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT ON THROUGH WHEN YOU

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:09.301 region:rollup2
DON'T BACK UP ON ONE SIDE OF THE

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:11.036 region:rollup2
ROAD SHOWS FOR ANY REASON WHY WE

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:12.438 region:rollup2
DON'T CONSIDER THE JAPANESE

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:13.639 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING APPROACH WHERE. YOU

02:15:12.438 --> 02:15:15.407 region:rollup2
DO HAVE TO ASK.

02:15:13.639 --> 02:15:17.242 region:rollup2
CALTRANS AND.

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:18.210 region:rollup2
AND THOSE FOLKS ON WELL ARE YOU

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:20.145 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THEM TO YOU KNOW

02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:21.847 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO REFER TO

02:15:20.145 --> 02:15:23.682 region:rollup2
KNOW A LITTLE BIT YES SO THEY%

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:25.184 region:rollup2
DON'T USE CULVERTS AS MUCH THEY

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:26.986 region:rollup2
DO TEND TO USE BRIDGES AND

02:15:25.184 --> 02:15:28.120 region:rollup2
DIVERSIONBASINS DIVERSION

02:15:26.986 --> 02:15:30.956 region:rollup2
BASINS I THINK IT'S THE PROPER

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.924 region:rollup2
NAME. RIGHT AND MY LAST QUESTION

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:34.760 region:rollup2
IS GIVEN.

02:15:31.924 --> 02:15:36.695 region:rollup2
THE OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.197 region:rollup2
AFTER THE MONTECITO FIRE. ARM

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:39.264 region:rollup2
THAT AND THE MAPPING AND SO

02:15:38.197 --> 02:15:41.567 region:rollup2
FORTH.

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:43.435 region:rollup2
THE IT IT WAS A REAL CONCERN

02:15:41.567 --> 02:15:45.070 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE AREAS

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:47.640 region:rollup2
RIGHT BELOW THE FIRE.

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:50.476 region:rollup2
WERE CLEARLY SUBJECT TO TO

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:52.411 region:rollup2
FLOODING INTO DEBRIS. BUT OUT SO

02:15:50.476 --> 02:15:54.346 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE DAMAGE OCCURRED.

02:15:52.411 --> 02:15:56.181 region:rollup2
FARTHER DOWN AND WHAT WAS NOT A

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:58.050 region:rollup2
MANDATORY EVACUATION AREA CAN

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:59.785 region:rollup2
YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE THINKING

02:15:58.050 --> 02:16:01.520 region:rollup2
WAS SERVED THERE GET WHAT THE

02:15:59.785 --> 02:16:03.088 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS WERE I MEAN NO

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.124 region:rollup2
ONE KNOWS WHAT MOTHER NATURE IS

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:06.058 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO NECESSARILY BUT.

02:16:05.124 --> 02:16:08.093 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THERE SOME

02:16:06.058 --> 02:16:09.728 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION FOR THE FACT THAT

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:10.929 region:rollup2
THEY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT? YOU

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:12.698 region:rollup2
CAN TO IT YOU KNOW FIVE AND A

02:16:10.929 --> 02:16:13.699 region:rollup2
HALF MILES

02:16:12.698 --> 02:16:16.001 region:rollup2
HA OF MUD FLOW I MEAN THAT'S A

02:16:13.699 --> 02:16:16.602 region:rollup2
LONG DISTANCE IN MONTECITO.

02:16:16.001 --> 02:16:22.908 region:rollup2
DOESN'T QUITE GO FIVE AND BUT.

02:16:16.602 --> 02:16:24.743 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WAS OR WASN'T

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:26.278 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED THAT PERHAPS WE CAN

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:28.213 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM GOING FORWARD WELL I

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:30.582 region:rollup2
I DON'T REALLY KNOW I KNOW WOULD

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:31.984 region:rollup2
WE MAPPED WHERE THOSE OF VALUE

02:16:30.582 --> 02:16:34.853 region:rollup2
AT RISK AREAS?

02:16:31.984 --> 02:16:37.289 region:rollup2
AND EXISTING ALREADY WERE FEMA

02:16:34.853 --> 02:16:37.956 region:rollup2
FLOOD ZONES THAT WERE IN THOSE

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:40.292 region:rollup2
AREAS.

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:41.827 region:rollup2
BUT WE TURN ALL THAT

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:43.462 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OVER TO THE LOCAL

02:16:41.827 --> 02:16:45.330 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES BECAUSE FOR ONE

02:16:43.462 --> 02:16:46.999 region:rollup2
THING WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO MAKE

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:49.034 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS WE

02:16:46.999 --> 02:16:51.703 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THE. COMMUNITY

02:16:49.034 --> 02:16:53.305 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES AND THE AREAS AND

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:55.174 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE DO THEY THEY KNOW

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:56.508 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW THE

02:16:55.174 --> 02:16:58.444 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THINK THEY HAVE THE

02:16:56.508 --> 02:17:00.212 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES TO DO THOSE THINGS.

02:16:58.444 --> 02:17:03.015 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

02:17:00.212 --> 02:17:05.484 region:rollup2
BEST INFORMATION WE CAN A WHAT

02:17:03.015 --> 02:17:09.121 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE HAZARD IS GOING TO

02:17:05.484 --> 02:17:12.658 region:rollup2
P.. AND TO LET THEM WORK OUT HOW

02:17:09.121 --> 02:17:14.259 region:rollup2
THAT THE BEST BELIEVE THEY CAN

02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:17.296 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HANDLE THAT SO IN THIS

02:17:14.259 --> 02:17:18.330 region:rollup2
WAS AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS. OF

02:17:17.296 --> 02:17:22.000 region:rollup2
STORM I DON'T THINK ANYONE

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:22.735 region:rollup2
REALLY ANTICIPATED IT WOULD BE

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.368 region:rollup2
THIS HUGE THANK YOU.

02:17:22.735 --> 02:17:24.069 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OFFER YOUR

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:25.737 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS VERY.

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:27.473 region:rollup2
INFORMATIVE AND AND AND THE

THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND AND I

02:19:33.265 --> 02:19:36.835 region:rollup2
THINK THAT GIVES US SOME SENSE

02:19:35.167 --> 02:19:38.503 region:rollup2
TO THE SCOPE OF OF OF THE

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:39.871 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:19:38.503 --> 02:19:41.840 region:rollup2
THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:43.809 region:rollup2
MAKE.

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.178 region:rollup2
IS THAT AS.

02:19:43.809 --> 02:19:47.713 region:rollup2

AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY ONE OF

02:19:49.548 --> 02:19:54.553 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT SHOULD NEVER BE

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:56.388 region:rollup2
FAR. FROM OUR MINDS WHEN WE

02:19:54.553 --> 02:19:59.057 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED WHAT TO DO MOVING

02:19:56.388 --> 02:20:00.459 region:rollup2
FORWARD AYE PASSED TO IN MY

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:02.494 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE INCLUDE THE INSURANCE

02:20:00.459 --> 02:20:04.329 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:06.031 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SOME

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:08.200 region:rollup2
WAYS IS GOING.

02:20:06.031 --> 02:20:08.367 region:rollup2
TO END UP PLAYING A LARGE ROLE

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:10.435 region:rollup2
IN.

02:20:08.367 --> 02:20:13.105 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:15.040 region:rollup2
WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALL.

02:20:13.105 --> 02:20:16.942 region:rollup2
DEVELOP.

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:18.210 region:rollup2
BOB BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT

02:20:16.942 --> 02:20:19.878 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PREPARED UNDERWRITE

02:20:18.210 --> 02:20:20.979 region:rollup2
CERTAIN KINDS OF RISK WILL

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:22.781 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER THAT IF

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:23.382 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT THAT AVENUE IS GOING

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:25.050 region:rollup2
TO BE PURSUED AND I'LL GIVE AN

02:20:23.382 --> 02:20:27.386 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:20:25.050 --> 02:20:28.620 region:rollup2
SENATOR JACKSON.

02:20:27.386 --> 02:20:31.156 region:rollup2
MADE REFERENCE TO HER BILL WITH

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:33.091 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO PRESCRIBED FIRE.

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:34.860 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL NEED

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:36.528 region:rollup2
TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THAT THAT

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:38.864 region:rollup2
IS THE ABILITY OF A PRIVATE

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:40.532 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNER TO OBTAIN A

02:20:38.864 --> 02:20:42.367 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IF THEY CHOOSE. TO

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:43.769 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THE PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:44.870 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AND I THAT IT

02:20:43.769 --> 02:20:45.470 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH

02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:46.271 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE TOLD

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.540 region:rollup2
ME.

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:50.175 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS IN FACT A WAY TO

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:52.244 region:rollup2
OBTAIN INSURANCE FOR A PROPERTY

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:54.446 region:rollup2
OWNER OF WHO WANTS TO.

02:20:52.244 --> 02:20:55.781 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN A PRESCRIBED

02:20:54.446 --> 02:20:56.782 region:rollup2
FIRE PROGRAMS.

02:20:55.781 --> 02:20:59.251 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK IS

02:20:56.782 --> 02:21:01.620 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS AS WETALK ABOUT.

02:20:59.251 --> 02:21:04.489 region:rollup2
OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH.

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:05.991 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED BURNS ES DE ASCHAM

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:08.026 region:rollup2
PARA TWO WILDFIRES.

02:21:05.991 --> 02:21:09.761 region:rollup2
GENERALLY THEY COST ABOUT TWO

02:21:08.026 --> 02:21:12.164 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE. A TO

02:21:09.761 --> 02:21:13.865 region:rollup2
MANAGE SO TO SPEAK A PRESCRIBED

02:21:12.164 --> 02:21:15.600 region:rollup2
BURN AWARE AS.

02:21:13.865 --> 02:21:17.035 region:rollup2
THE OF THE ACCEPTED NUMBERS

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:18.537 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:20.038 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AN ACRE FOR FIRE

02:21:18.537 --> 02:21:22.007 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSION ON A WILDFIRE. THAT

02:21:20.038 --> 02:21:24.710 region:rollup2
DOESN'T INCLUDE.

02:21:22.007 --> 02:21:26.244 region:rollup2
THE COST TO THE COMMUNITY UP FOR

02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:28.480 region:rollup2
EITHER LOSS OF LIFE BUT LOTS OF

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:29.047 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE REBUILDING OR

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:30.482 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PAYMENTS THAT ARE

02:21:29.047 --> 02:21:32.551 region:rollup2
MADE.

02:21:30.482 --> 02:21:35.921 region:rollup2
OF THE TO THE.

02:21:32.551 --> 02:21:37.089 region:rollup2
HOLDERS OF THE INSURANCE SO THE

02:21:35.921 --> 02:21:37.622 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE.

02:21:37.089 --> 02:21:40.826 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC AND EXTREME AND I

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:43.428 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:21:40.826 --> 02:21:46.264 region:rollup2
WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE.

02:21:43.428 --> 02:21:48.100 region:rollup2
HAVING. BEEN ON THAT SIDE OF THE

02:21:46.264 --> 02:21:49.034 region:rollup2
DIETS WHERE YOU ARE NOW I KNOW

02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:50.502 region:rollup2
THAT A BIG PART OF THE

02:21:49.034 --> 02:21:52.371 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD IS

02:21:50.502 --> 02:21:53.372 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE HOW DO WE PAY FOR

02:21:52.371 --> 02:21:56.708 region:rollup2
THIS. WHERE'S THE MONEY COME

02:21:53.372 --> 02:21:57.576 region:rollup2
FROM ARE AND SO PART OF THE

02:21:56.708 --> 02:22:00.145 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS PICKING OUT ANY LATER.

02:21:57.576 --> 02:22:01.413 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EITHER FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:22:00.145 --> 02:22:03.815 region:rollup2
MOVE RESOURCES AND GET

02:22:01.413 --> 02:22:05.450 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO ENGAGE

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:07.352 region:rollup2
IN PRESCRIBED FIRE AND THINNING

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:09.287 region:rollup2
UP OR YOU CAN SUCK IT OUT OF THE

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:11.256 region:rollup2
BUDGET WHEN YOU HAVE TO AFTER

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:12.391 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HAD A WILDFIRE.

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:15.961 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PART THAT IS GOING TO

PLAY. AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE

02:22:15.961 --> 02:22:19.965 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY ANY AIRPORTS.

02:22:17.796 --> 02:22:21.833 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A WILDFIRE

02:22:19.965 --> 02:22:23.068 region:rollup2
ALL OF WHICH IS EMITTED INTO THE

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:25.303 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE.

02:22:23.068 --> 02:22:26.805 region:rollup2

LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL.

02:22:26.805 --> 02:22:30.175 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY FIRE RESISTANT.

02:23:29.034 --> 02:23:33.905 region:rollup2
BUT WITH A THREE HUNDRED FOUR

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:35.674 region:rollup2
HUNDRED YOU HAVE SHADE OF. THESE

02:23:33.905 --> 02:23:37.542 region:rollup2
TREES THAT GROW WELL IN SHADE

02:23:35.674 --> 02:23:38.844 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ACTUALLY ADD FUEL THE

02:23:37.542 --> 02:23:40.745 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF MARKET

02:23:38.844 --> 02:23:42.647 region:rollup2
IS FIRE RESISTANT THAT CREATE A

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:44.483 region:rollup2
LATTER ESSENTIALLY. SO THE FIRE

02:23:42.647 --> 02:23:46.017 region:rollup2
GROWS FROM THE GROUND UP TO THE

02:23:44.483 --> 02:23:48.320 region:rollup2
TREE TOPS THAT YOU THEN HAVE

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:50.622 region:rollup2
CANOPY BURNS THAT HOP AND SKIP

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:53.325 region:rollup2
UP ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. SO.

02:23:50.622 --> 02:23:55.527 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY PRESCRIBED BURN AND

02:23:53.325 --> 02:23:56.995 region:rollup2
THINNING BOB ARE TWO OF THE

02:23:55.527 --> 02:23:59.431 region:rollup2
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE

02:23:56.995 --> 02:24:01.132 region:rollup2
MADE IN OUR REPORT. OUR REPORT

02:23:59.431 --> 02:24:02.801 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES LONG.

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:04.569 region:rollup2
WE WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO

02:24:02.801 --> 02:24:06.805 region:rollup2
THE EXPERTS WHO OFFERED THEIR

02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:08.373 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AND PROVIDE US WITH

02:24:06.805 --> 02:24:10.275 region:rollup2
INFORMATION STAFF FREAK OF A

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:11.076 region:rollup2
COORDINATED THOSE MEETINGS AS

02:24:10.275 --> 02:24:14.112 region:rollup2
WELL AS A REVIEW OF THE

02:24:11.076 --> 02:24:15.480 region:rollup2
LITERATURE. AND SAID THAT LED TO

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:17.115 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.482 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT YOU WANT TO A DO

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:19.985 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:22.621 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE ISSUES IS THAT

02:24:19.985 --> 02:24:24.256 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES RELEASE PM TWO POINT

02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:25.891 region:rollup2
FIVE TALKING OF AIR QUALITY A

02:24:24.256 --> 02:24:27.392 region:rollup2
INTO THE AIR TWO POINT FIVE IS

02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:28.927 region:rollup2
TOO SMALL.

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:29.661 region:rollup2
IT GETS INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM

02:24:28.927 --> 02:24:31.596 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY TO PROTECT

02:24:29.661 --> 02:24:33.932 region:rollup2
YOURSELF FROM IT.

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:35.367 region:rollup2
AND IT REALLY WORKS AT CROSS

02:24:33.932 --> 02:24:37.903 region:rollup2
PURPOSES FROM WHAT THE STATE OF

02:24:35.367 --> 02:24:39.437 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS IDENTIFIED. AS

02:24:37.903 --> 02:24:40.539 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE GOALS OF

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:41.873 region:rollup2
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS SO FOR

02:24:40.539 --> 02:24:44.509 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:46.077 region:rollup2
BOB THEN TWENTY FIFTEEN.

02:24:44.509 --> 02:24:48.280 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THROUGH ALL OF ITS

02:24:46.077 --> 02:24:50.081 region:rollup2
EFFORTS AND IT TOOK SOME

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.516 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY.

02:24:50.081 --> 02:24:53.785 region:rollup2
REDUCE ITS EMISSIONS FROM

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:55.954 region:rollup2
ROUTINE OMITTING ACTIVITIES BY

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:57.556 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION METRIC

02:24:55.954 --> 02:24:59.424 region:rollup2
TONS. AND WERE ALL VERY EXCITED

02:24:57.556 --> 02:25:00.025 region:rollup2
HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

02:24:59.424 --> 02:25:00.992 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE

02:25:00.025 --> 02:25:03.228 region:rollup2
DOING.

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:04.729 region:rollup2
BUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE RUFF

02:25:03.228 --> 02:25:06.932 region:rollup2
FIRE IN THE SIERRA NATIONAL

02:25:04.729 --> 02:25:09.601 region:rollup2
FOREST IN FRESNO. RELEASED SIX

02:25:06.932 --> 02:25:11.570 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS.

02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:13.271 region:rollup2
SO ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE

02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:15.373 region:rollup2
CHANGING OUR ACTIVITY AS A

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:17.309 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND SOCIETY BECAUSE WE

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:19.211 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

02:25:17.309 --> 02:25:21.680 region:rollup2
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES BUT ON

02:25:19.211 --> 02:25:23.748 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:25.183 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN WORKING APPROPRIATELY

02:25:23.748 --> 02:25:27.285 region:rollup2
IN FORCE MANAGEMENT.

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:28.887 region:rollup2
WE COMPLETELY UNDO THE BENEFITS

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:30.455 region:rollup2
THAT COME ABOUT FROM REDUCTION

02:25:28.887 --> 02:25:32.490 region:rollup2
OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES.

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:33.992 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT.

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:35.927 region:rollup2
FANS PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

02:25:33.992 --> 02:25:37.429 region:rollup2
ALSO REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT

02:25:35.927 --> 02:25:37.896 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:39.698 region:rollup2
BUDGET. GOES TO FORCE

02:25:37.896 --> 02:25:41.900 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

02:25:39.698 --> 02:25:44.569 region:rollup2
ONLY FIVE PERCENT.

02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:46.504 region:rollup2
THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE.

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:47.238 region:rollup2
OF A DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:49.140 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY GOING BACK TO THE

02:25:47.238 --> 02:25:50.642 region:rollup2
NINETEEN HUNDREDS.

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:52.277 region:rollup2
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:25:50.642 --> 02:25:53.445 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT THEIR FIRE

02:25:52.277 --> 02:25:54.913 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSION POLICIES WOULD BE IF

02:25:53.445 --> 02:25:56.114 region:rollup2
YOU HAD A FIERY PUT IT OUT.

02:25:54.913 --> 02:25:57.482 region:rollup2
THAT NO FIRE SHOULD GROW GREATER

02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:58.717 region:rollup2
THAN TEN ACRES

02:25:57.482 --> 02:26:00.185 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS LATER THEY THEN

02:25:58.717 --> 02:26:01.586 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT EVERY FIRE THAT

02:26:00.185 --> 02:26:02.187 region:rollup2
STARTED IN THE WILDERNESS SHOULD

02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:03.722 region:rollup2
BE PUT OUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THE

02:26:02.187 --> 02:26:05.357 region:rollup2
NEXT MORNING.

02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:07.392 region:rollup2
THAT THEN MEANT THAT THERE WERE

02:26:05.357 --> 02:26:08.960 region:rollup2
NO FIRES THAT ROUTINELY SERVE

02:26:07.392 --> 02:26:10.862 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:13.398 region:rollup2
OF ESSENTIALLY CLEARING OUT THE

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:15.433 region:rollup2
UNDERGROWTH. THAT THOUGHT THEM

02:26:13.398 --> 02:26:16.468 region:rollup2
LED TO THE SORT OF CATASTROPHIC

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:18.203 region:rollup2
FIRES THAT WERE CONFRONTING NOW.

02:26:16.468 --> 02:26:19.771 region:rollup2
.

02:26:18.203 --> 02:26:21.406 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

02:26:19.771 --> 02:26:22.874 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND I SAY

02:26:21.406 --> 02:26:23.708 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:24.743 region:rollup2
EMBRACED BY MANY OTHER

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:25.477 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS HAS TO DO WITH

02:26:24.743 --> 02:26:27.679 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:26:25.477 --> 02:26:28.880 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:26:27.679 --> 02:26:30.582 region:rollup2
WE HAD A COMMISSIONER WHEN WE

02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:32.684 region:rollup2
FIRST STARTED THIS STUDY.

02:26:30.582 --> 02:26:33.284 region:rollup2
WHO GENUINELY SAID WHY DO I CARE

02:26:32.684 --> 02:26:34.819 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FOREST I LIVE IN LOS

02:26:33.284 --> 02:26:36.321 region:rollup2
ANGELES?

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:37.622 region:rollup2
I LIVE IN THE BAY AREA I LIVE

02:26:36.321 --> 02:26:38.890 region:rollup2
WHERE EVER I LIVE IN AN URBAN

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:40.625 region:rollup2
AREAS WHY DO I CARE.

02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.560 region:rollup2
AND IT REALLY PROMPTED US TO

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:45.363 region:rollup2
BEGIN AN ANALYSIS OF THIS

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.032 region:rollup2
SITUATION SO THAT WE. COULD

02:26:45.363 --> 02:26:49.300 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULD CARE THAT

02:26:47.032 --> 02:26:50.802 region:rollup2
A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA IS FOREST

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:52.537 region:rollup2
THAT ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT IS

02:26:50.802 --> 02:26:54.739 region:rollup2
OWNED BY THE FEDS.

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:56.141 region:rollup2
THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR

02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:58.443 region:rollup2
HEADWATERS ARE LOCATED IN THE

02:26:56.141 --> 02:27:00.278 region:rollup2
SIERRAS. AND THAT BECAUSE OF

02:26:58.443 --> 02:27:02.514 region:rollup2
THESE FIRES AIR QUALITY BUT IS

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:03.982 region:rollup2
IMPACTED AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:06.051 region:rollup2
WATER IN A DROUGHT.

02:27:03.982 --> 02:27:08.353 region:rollup2
COULD BE INCREASED BY A CERTAIN

02:27:06.051 --> 02:27:09.954 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE WITH A HEALTHY FOREST

02:27:08.353 --> 02:27:11.556 region:rollup2
SO WE SUGGEST LITTLE HOOVER

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:13.024 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THAT PART OF WHAT

02:27:11.556 --> 02:27:15.193 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE IS AN EDUCATION

02:27:13.024 --> 02:27:17.562 region:rollup2
OF THE PUBLIC. ALONG THE SAME

02:27:15.193 --> 02:27:19.130 region:rollup2
SCOPE AS THE SAVE OUR WATER

02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:20.365 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN MOST PEOPLE NEVER CARED

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:21.366 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT HE OPEN THE TAP TO

02:27:20.365 --> 02:27:22.867 region:rollup2
GET AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

02:27:21.366 --> 02:27:24.336 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY HAD A DROUGHT REMEMBER

02:27:22.867 --> 02:27:24.836 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO NEVER WASTE A GOOD

02:27:24.336 --> 02:27:26.638 region:rollup2
CRISIS SO BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:24.836 --> 02:27:27.872 region:rollup2
DROUGHT.

02:27:26.638 --> 02:27:30.075 region:rollup2
WE GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:31.443 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WE BELIEVE THAT ARE

02:27:30.075 --> 02:27:34.312 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.

02:27:31.443 --> 02:27:35.447 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:36.948 region:rollup2
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FORCE

02:27:35.447 --> 02:27:38.817 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE ALL ONE STATE THAT

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:39.851 region:rollup2
WERE ALL RELATED AND THAT WHAT

02:27:38.817 --> 02:27:41.486 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN THE FOREST IN THE

02:27:39.851 --> 02:27:43.088 region:rollup2
SIERRAS. HAS AN IMPACT ON YOU IF

02:27:41.486 --> 02:27:44.656 region:rollup2
YOU LIVE IN SAN DIEGO LOS

02:27:43.088 --> 02:27:46.725 region:rollup2
ANGELES SANTA MONICA SANTA

BARBARA OR IN NORTHERN

02:27:46.725 --> 02:27:48.827 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS WELL.

02:27:47.659 --> 02:27:50.495 region:rollup2
THAT AND WITH THAT LET ME

02:27:48.827 --> 02:27:51.730 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE BECAUSE WE HAVE. TWO

02:27:50.495 --> 02:27:52.063 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE WHO I THINK

02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:53.431 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE.

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:54.299 region:rollup2
.

02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:55.467 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT STUFF TO

02:27:54.299 --> 02:27:59.404 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAN I DO.

02:27:55.467 --> 02:27:59.571 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:27:59.404 --> 02:28:01.606 region:rollup2
SO.

02:27:59.571 --> 02:28:03.842 region:rollup2
.

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:06.378 region:rollup2
THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:28:03.842 --> 02:28:07.312 region:rollup2
JUSTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC.

02:28:06.378 --> 02:28:08.780 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WELCOME COULD YOU

02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:10.248 region:rollup2
INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND PUT MIKE

02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:11.249 region:rollup2
JUST A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU SO

I'M JEFF CHAIRPERSON I'M AN

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:14.185 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT UC

02:28:13.218 --> 02:28:15.653 region:rollup2
BERKELEY IN THE GEOGRAPHY

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:18.056 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. AND ALSO FACTLY

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:18.523 region:rollup2
SCIENTIST AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY

02:28:18.056 --> 02:28:20.325 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LABORATORY.

02:28:18.523 --> 02:28:22.260 region:rollup2
SO I BASICALLY STUDY HOW EXTREME

02:28:20.325 --> 02:28:24.562 region:rollup2
EVENTS IMPACT FLORES.

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:25.830 region:rollup2
NO I'M PERMITTED OF CALIFORNIAN

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:27.999 region:rollup2
BUT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:30.602 region:rollup2
FIVE I WAS LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:31.302 region:rollup2
ON FACULTY AT TULANE UNIVERSITY.

02:28:30.602 --> 02:28:33.371 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHAT PATRICIA LOOKED

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:36.174 region:rollup2
LIKE THE DAY BEFORE SHE MADE

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:38.009 region:rollup2
LANDFALL AT THE PRO RIVER. WHICH

02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:39.410 region:rollup2
DEFINES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN.

02:28:38.009 --> 02:28:41.246 region:rollup2
LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI RIGHT

02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:43.381 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:28:41.246 --> 02:28:44.783 region:rollup2
SO. WHAT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:46.017 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THE WORK THAT I'VE

02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:47.252 region:rollup2
DONE IN THE PAST AND HER

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:48.920 region:rollup2
APPLYING THAT SOME OF THESE

02:28:47.252 --> 02:28:50.555 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS?

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.023 region:rollup2
SO SUCH A WHAT WE DO IS WE USE

02:28:50.555 --> 02:28:52.624 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND AFTER AN INJURY SO

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:54.826 region:rollup2
LET'S ZOOM INTO THE PRO RIVER

02:28:52.624 --> 02:28:56.895 region:rollup2
RIGHT HERE.

02:28:54.826 --> 02:28:59.097 region:rollup2
PRO RIVER PEARL RIVER. THAT'S

02:28:56.895 --> 02:29:00.799 region:rollup2
BEFORE KATRINA MADE LAND FALL

02:28:59.097 --> 02:29:02.133 region:rollup2
GREEN MEANS HEALTHY VEGETATION

02:29:00.799 --> 02:29:02.567 region:rollup2
RED MEANS DEADWOOD DEAD

02:29:02.133 --> 02:29:04.536 region:rollup2
VEGETATION.

02:29:02.567 --> 02:29:06.971 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

02:29:04.536 --> 02:29:09.441 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

02:29:06.971 --> 02:29:11.843 region:rollup2
SUBTRACT THE IMAGES.

02:29:09.441 --> 02:29:12.844 region:rollup2
YOU GET A DIFFERENT IMAGE HERE.

02:29:11.843 --> 02:29:14.646 region:rollup2
MASK OUT ANYTHING THAT'S NOT

02:29:12.844 --> 02:29:15.613 region:rollup2
FOREST

02:29:14.646 --> 02:29:16.581 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT IT'S OF THE TEN

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:18.650 region:rollup2
COLOR.

02:29:16.581 --> 02:29:20.185 region:rollup2
IS A FORCED IT PICKS UP.

02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:21.686 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN SEE RESOURCE IN BLUE

02:29:20.185 --> 02:29:23.388 region:rollup2
NO IMPACT

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:25.857 region:rollup2
NONE OF THE TREES WENT DOWN.

02:29:23.388 --> 02:29:27.692 region:rollup2
RIGHT NEXT DOOR THESE A. OAK

02:29:25.857 --> 02:29:28.893 region:rollup2
MAPLE FORESTS COMPLETELY

02:29:27.692 --> 02:29:30.461 region:rollup2
DESTROYED YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT

02:29:28.893 --> 02:29:32.730 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:33.932 region:rollup2
CYPRESS TUPELO'S WHAT FOREST'S.

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:35.400 region:rollup2
OAK MAPLE FORESTS COMPLETELY

02:29:33.932 --> 02:29:38.403 region:rollup2
DESTROYED.

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:40.171 region:rollup2
NOW. TO QUANTIFY THIS TO SAY HOW

02:29:38.403 --> 02:29:41.606 region:rollup2
MANY TREES DIED AND HOW DOES

02:29:40.171 --> 02:29:43.074 region:rollup2
THAT VERY SPATIALLY. WE NEED TO

02:29:41.606 --> 02:29:43.741 region:rollup2
GET UP THE FIELD.

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:46.077 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S.

02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:47.645 region:rollup2
SO DIFFICULT WORK.

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:48.146 region:rollup2
WE MEASURED MORE COUNTY DAMAGE

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:50.215 region:rollup2
RATES IN THE FIELD IS A

02:29:48.146 --> 02:29:51.816 region:rollup2
FUNCTION.

02:29:50.215 --> 02:29:55.153 region:rollup2
OF THIS CHANGE METRIC FROM

02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:56.087 region:rollup2
SATELLITE AND TRIGGER A.

02:29:55.153 --> 02:29:57.522 region:rollup2
WE PUBLISH THIS BACK IN TWO

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:58.456 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND SEVEN TWO YEARS

02:29:57.522 --> 02:30:00.859 region:rollup2
AFTER KATRINA MADE LANDFALL IN

02:29:58.456 --> 02:30:02.060 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

02:30:00.859 --> 02:30:03.595 region:rollup2
AND WE ESTIMATED HER PINKY TRINA

02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:04.896 region:rollup2
KILLED OR SEVERELY DAMAGED THREE

02:30:03.595 --> 02:30:07.498 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TREES.

02:30:04.896 --> 02:30:08.399 region:rollup2
TOOK US TWO YEARS TO DO THIS.

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:10.401 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:12.437 region:rollup2
USING SOME MODERN TOOLS?

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:13.571 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE HAS THIS

02:30:12.437 --> 02:30:15.273 region:rollup2
PLATFORM CALLED EARTH ENGINE

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:17.675 region:rollup2
THAT'S PHENOMENAL.

02:30:15.273 --> 02:30:18.843 region:rollup2
SO I HAD A STUDENT THAT JUST

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:20.245 region:rollup2
JOIN ME AGAIN WHAT I IN

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:21.546 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER.

02:30:20.245 --> 02:30:23.448 region:rollup2
AND I SAID HEY LET'S SO LET'S

02:30:21.546 --> 02:30:24.983 region:rollup2
SPEND UP THESE TOOLS AND LET'S

02:30:23.448 --> 02:30:26.217 region:rollup2
RUN IT THROUGH THIS EARTH ENGINE

02:30:24.983 --> 02:30:28.319 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:30.388 region:rollup2
TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF MARIA.

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:31.623 region:rollup2
MCCARTY RICO.

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:32.991 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE KATRINA BEFORE.

02:30:31.623 --> 02:30:35.226 region:rollup2
AFTER.

02:30:32.991 --> 02:30:37.061 region:rollup2
FOR AFTER.

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:38.730 region:rollup2
THE DISTURBANCE SO AGAIN

02:30:37.061 --> 02:30:40.031 region:rollup2
ANYTHING IN COLOR IS FORESTED.

02:30:38.730 --> 02:30:41.733 region:rollup2
THIS SHOWS THE IMPACT ACROSS

02:30:40.031 --> 02:30:44.002 region:rollup2
ENTIRE ISLAND AND HOW THAT VERY

02:30:41.733 --> 02:30:44.869 region:rollup2
SPATIALLY. THIS IS ABOUT TWENTY

02:30:44.002 --> 02:30:46.538 region:rollup2
TO THIRTY MILLION TREES WE WON'T

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:48.139 region:rollup2
KNOW PRECISELY UNTIL WE DO THE

02:30:46.538 --> 02:30:49.674 region:rollup2
FIELD WORK.

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:50.875 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF INFORMED THAT

02:30:49.674 --> 02:30:52.610 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THE

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:53.244 region:rollup2
SATELLITES ARE TELLING US AND

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:54.946 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:58.416 region:rollup2
GROUND.

02:30:54.946 --> 02:31:00.184 region:rollup2
SO.

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:01.586 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS TO PROVIDE THIS

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:03.288 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY.

02:31:01.586 --> 02:31:04.489 region:rollup2
AND I WAS SITTING NEXT TO MY

02:31:03.288 --> 02:31:05.757 region:rollup2
STUDENT AND I ACTUALLY ANOTHER

02:31:04.489 --> 02:31:07.292 region:rollup2
WE WERE HAVING LAST WEEK I SAID

02:31:05.757 --> 02:31:08.993 region:rollup2
WELL WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THIS

02:31:07.292 --> 02:31:11.996 region:rollup2
TOOL. HERE.

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:14.032 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR FEDERICO.

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:15.433 region:rollup2
AND THAT SHOULD SHIFTED OVER TO.

02:31:14.032 --> 02:31:17.769 region:rollup2
THE THE FIRES HERE THE TUBS.

02:31:15.433 --> 02:31:20.071 region:rollup2
THE.

02:31:17.769 --> 02:31:21.839 region:rollup2
NUNS IN THE ATLAS FIRES AND YOU

02:31:20.071 --> 02:31:23.575 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THAT. IT JUST MAPPED OUT

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:25.310 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY YOU COULD PUT THAT

02:31:23.575 --> 02:31:26.411 region:rollup2
MAP OVER A BASE MAP YOU KNOW

02:31:25.310 --> 02:31:28.012 region:rollup2
HERE'S HERE'S THE EIGHTY THAT I

02:31:26.411 --> 02:31:29.814 region:rollup2
DROVE FROM BERKELEY HAVE TO HEAR

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:30.782 region:rollup2
THIS MORNING.

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:33.017 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHAT I ONE HEADING NORTH

02:31:30.782 --> 02:31:34.586 region:rollup2
OF HERE SANTA ROSA. BALLOT ZOOM

02:31:33.017 --> 02:31:35.653 region:rollup2
INTO THIS REGION RIGHT HERE.

02:31:34.586 --> 02:31:36.554 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE A NUMBER OF THE OTHER

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:38.122 region:rollup2
PANELISTS WERE DESCRIBING.

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:40.725 region:rollup2
THIS

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:42.827 region:rollup2
VEGETATION URBAN INTERFACE IT

02:31:40.725 --> 02:31:44.562 region:rollup2
CAN GET REALLY COMPLEX THE WAY

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:45.596 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRES SPREAD.

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:46.597 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THEY INTERACT WITH

02:31:45.596 --> 02:31:48.466 region:rollup2
THESE COMMUNITIES YOU CAN SEE

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:50.101 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE HOMES JUST

02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:51.336 region:rollup2
RIDLEY DESTROYED IN THIS REGION.

02:31:50.101 --> 02:31:53.271 region:rollup2
WHERE THE FIRE JUMPED THE ONE A

02:31:51.336 --> 02:31:55.807 region:rollup2
ONE? THIS REGION A FOUNTAIN

02:31:53.271 --> 02:31:57.742 region:rollup2
GROWTH HERE. AND THESE TOOLS CAN

02:31:55.807 --> 02:31:59.277 region:rollup2
BE BEFORE PROVIDED WITHIN.

02:31:57.742 --> 02:32:00.745 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A WEEK OR TWO OF THIS

02:31:59.277 --> 02:32:03.448 region:rollup2
THESE EXTREME EVENTS USING THESE

02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:04.082 region:rollup2
MODERN TOOLS.

02:32:03.448 --> 02:32:06.184 region:rollup2
SO.

02:32:04.082 --> 02:32:07.518 region:rollup2
DIDN'T.

02:32:06.184 --> 02:32:08.686 region:rollup2
TO THE PURE THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:10.054 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE TO FOCUS ON SO

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:11.756 region:rollup2
HOW THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE

02:32:10.054 --> 02:32:12.657 region:rollup2
CHANGING WELL. THE TEMPERATURES

02:32:11.756 --> 02:32:13.858 region:rollup2
ARE JUST GOING TO RISE AND WE'VE

02:32:12.657 --> 02:32:15.960 region:rollup2
JUST SEEN THE BEGINNING OF ITS

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:16.561 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING AND SO WHAT YOU'RE

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:18.196 region:rollup2
SAYING NOW IS JUST THE START.

02:32:16.561 --> 02:32:19.864 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:18.196 --> 02:32:21.499 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE OF

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:22.867 region:rollup2
THESE TEMPERATURE CHANGES THAT

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:24.435 region:rollup2
THE TRICKY THING IS IS THAT

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:25.036 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATION CAN KIND OF GO ONE

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:26.504 region:rollup2
WAY OR THE OTHER WITH CLIMATE

02:32:25.036 --> 02:32:27.505 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

02:32:26.504 --> 02:32:29.440 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE

02:32:27.505 --> 02:32:30.742 region:rollup2
GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODELS OUT TO

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:32.510 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY SIXTY

02:32:30.742 --> 02:32:33.678 region:rollup2
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:35.246 region:rollup2
ARE PREDICTING THAT NOT ONLY IS

02:32:33.678 --> 02:32:36.014 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER BUT A

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:38.383 region:rollup2
LOT DRIER IN CALIFORNIA.

02:32:36.014 --> 02:32:40.051 region:rollup2
WHICH

02:32:38.383 --> 02:32:41.519 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY

02:32:40.051 --> 02:32:41.953 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC FOR YOU KNOW

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:43.554 region:rollup2
SNOWPACK AND OTHER.

02:32:41.953 --> 02:32:45.456 region:rollup2
.

02:32:43.554 --> 02:32:48.559 region:rollup2
PROCESSES BUT ALSO FOR METALLIC

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:49.727 region:rollup2
SO. TREE MORTALITY SO THIS IS

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.928 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE SCARED ABOUT US OF

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:52.463 region:rollup2
FEAR ABOUT ARRANGE ANOTHER

02:32:50.928 --> 02:32:53.097 region:rollup2
STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY WE'VE

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:54.866 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR ABOUT A

02:32:53.097 --> 02:32:56.067 region:rollup2
YEAR IT'S IT'S A PROJECT THAT'S

02:32:54.866 --> 02:32:57.568 region:rollup2
FUNDED BY SOME SEED MONEY FROM

02:32:56.067 --> 02:32:58.669 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OFFICE

02:32:57.568 --> 02:32:59.771 region:rollup2
OF THE PRESIDENT.

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:00.938 region:rollup2
USING THAT SAME EARTH ENGINE

02:32:59.771 --> 02:33:02.807 region:rollup2
PLATFORM IN SOME OTHER

02:33:00.938 --> 02:33:03.441 region:rollup2
ANALYTICAL TOOLS WE'VE MAPPED

02:33:02.807 --> 02:33:04.642 region:rollup2
OUT THE ENTIRE HEARING ABOUT IT

02:33:03.441 --> 02:33:06.577 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:08.946 region:rollup2
THESE THIS THIS THIS THE REDNESS

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:10.314 region:rollup2
HERE INDICATES.

02:33:08.946 --> 02:33:12.483 region:rollup2
DISTURBANCE INDICATES

02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:13.851 region:rollup2
TREE MORTALITY.

02:33:12.483 --> 02:33:15.787 region:rollup2
IF WE ZOOM INTO THIS REGION

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:17.355 region:rollup2
RIGHT HERE. THAT CENTERED ON

02:33:15.787 --> 02:33:18.089 region:rollup2
WHAT VOTER.

02:33:17.355 --> 02:33:20.224 region:rollup2
YOU SEE BURKE IT'S GOT SOME

02:33:18.089 --> 02:33:20.858 region:rollup2
CABINS ACTUALLY THE UNIVERSE TO

02:33:20.224 --> 02:33:22.026 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S GOT SOME CABINS OUT

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:23.461 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:23.928 region:rollup2
WE HIKED UP THIS TRAIL RIGHT

02:33:23.461 --> 02:33:25.329 region:rollup2
HERE THIS IS CHILDREN

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:27.265 region:rollup2
WATERFALLS.

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:28.900 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE LOOKED OUT.

02:33:27.265 --> 02:33:30.768 region:rollup2
OVER HERE TO JUST SAY SO WHAT DO

02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:33.471 region:rollup2
THESE PATCHES.

02:33:30.768 --> 02:33:35.973 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE IN THE FIELD.

02:33:33.471 --> 02:33:37.141 region:rollup2
HIKE UP THE STEEP SIDE HERE OUT

02:33:35.973 --> 02:33:38.910 region:rollup2
THE CHILL THE WATERFALLS AND I

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:41.245 region:rollup2
TOOK THIS PICTURE.

02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:43.715 region:rollup2
SO SHOWING THE SWATHS HERE WERE

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:45.083 region:rollup2
EVERY TREE WAS DEAD.

02:33:43.715 --> 02:33:47.485 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

02:33:45.083 --> 02:33:49.020 region:rollup2
A HEALTHY STAND.

02:33:47.485 --> 02:33:50.288 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING TO

02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:51.789 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHY

02:33:50.288 --> 02:33:53.491 region:rollup2
IS IT THAT THESE TREES ARE DYING

02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:54.826 region:rollup2
IN THE STREETS ARE.

02:33:53.491 --> 02:33:56.027 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE OTHER.

02:33:54.826 --> 02:33:57.862 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK THAT WE DO.

02:33:56.027 --> 02:33:58.930 region:rollup2
.

02:33:57.862 --> 02:34:01.165 region:rollup2
MY LABORATORY AT A BERKELEY LAB

02:33:58.930 --> 02:34:01.766 region:rollup2
IS.

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:03.301 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GETTING INSIDE THESE

02:34:01.766 --> 02:34:04.902 region:rollup2
PLANTS AND FIGURING OUT HOW THE

02:34:03.301 --> 02:34:06.604 region:rollup2
DEFENDING THEMSELVES.

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:08.206 region:rollup2
WHY IS IT THAT SOME TREES CAN

02:34:06.604 --> 02:34:09.807 region:rollup2
RESIST THESE EXTREME EVENTS

02:34:08.206 --> 02:34:11.542 region:rollup2
WHILE OTHERS COULD SUCCUMB?

02:34:09.807 --> 02:34:13.111 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY MENTIONED BEETLES

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:15.913 region:rollup2
IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE VOLATILE

02:34:13.111 --> 02:34:17.448 region:rollup2
ISOPRENOID. ACT AS ANTI OXIDANTS

02:34:15.913 --> 02:34:20.184 region:rollup2
IN PLANTS THEY TRY TO THINK THEY

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:20.718 region:rollup2
PRODUCE THOSE CUT OUTS TO DEFEND

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:22.353 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES FROM OXIDATIVE

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:23.354 region:rollup2
STRESS.

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:24.622 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE PEOPLE DO. BUT IT

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:26.324 region:rollup2
TURNS OUT THE INSECTS

02:34:24.622 --> 02:34:28.593 region:rollup2
CAN TARGET AND AND SINCE THAT

02:34:26.324 --> 02:34:30.161 region:rollup2
SIGNAL AND SENSE WEAKNESS

02:34:28.593 --> 02:34:32.363 region:rollup2
AND I CAN KIND OF ACCELERATE.

02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:33.431 region:rollup2
THE DEMISE OF THOSE TREES.

02:34:32.363 --> 02:34:35.399 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ANOTHER.

02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:38.035 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR RESEARCH.

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:39.704 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS BETTER UNDERSTANDING

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:40.571 region:rollup2
WHY SOME TREES SURVIVE WHAT OF

02:34:39.704 --> 02:34:41.606 region:rollup2
THE THRESHOLD FROM STRESS TO

02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:41.773 region:rollup2
DEATH.

02:34:41.606 --> 02:34:43.641 region:rollup2
AND.

02:34:41.773 --> 02:34:45.343 region:rollup2
.

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:48.079 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAD A FEW

02:34:45.343 --> 02:34:50.047 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON FORCE MANAGEMENT.

02:34:48.079 --> 02:34:51.549 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A TOUGH

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:52.984 region:rollup2
PROBLEM YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST

02:34:51.549 --> 02:34:55.052 region:rollup2
REALLY I MEAN IF YOU LIKE I JUST

02:34:52.984 --> 02:34:56.854 region:rollup2
SAW. A KIND OF A GRAPH OF THE

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:58.456 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURE CHANGE ACROSS THE

02:34:56.854 --> 02:35:00.057 region:rollup2
PLANET FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY TO

02:34:58.456 --> 02:35:01.359 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT JUSTICE THE SERIES

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:02.660 region:rollup2
OF IMAGES AND YOU CAN CLEARLY

02:35:01.359 --> 02:35:04.729 region:rollup2
SEE THE ACCELERATION OF THE LAST

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:06.430 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:35:04.729 --> 02:35:10.334 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT. TWENTY

02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:11.903 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:13.704 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S IT'S A LOT OF INERTIA

02:35:11.903 --> 02:35:15.072 region:rollup2
IN THE EARTH SYSTEM.

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:17.575 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S A. VERY CHALLENGING

02:35:15.072 --> 02:35:19.277 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:35:17.575 --> 02:35:20.278 region:rollup2
AND THEN AS YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:35:19.277 --> 02:35:20.645 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE STATE EDUCATION

02:35:20.278 --> 02:35:22.747 region:rollup2
SERVICE FIELD.

02:35:20.645 --> 02:35:24.115 region:rollup2
FOR THESE FACTORS.

02:35:22.747 --> 02:35:26.450 region:rollup2
SO BEING ABLE TO MATHIS OUT AND

02:35:24.115 --> 02:35:27.919 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:29.086 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT GET VEGETATION AND THE

02:35:27.919 --> 02:35:31.689 region:rollup2
WITH AND AND THESE CLARA HIGH

02:35:29.086 --> 02:35:32.623 region:rollup2
HIGH HIGH HIGH VELOCITY WINDS.

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:33.491 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH OUR URBAN

02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:34.559 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS IT'S CHALLENGING

02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:36.194 region:rollup2
THAT AT SOME OF THESE SOME OF

02:35:34.559 --> 02:35:38.095 region:rollup2
THESE NEW TOOLS CAN CUT OFF I

02:35:36.194 --> 02:35:39.897 region:rollup2
THINK HELP US TO. BETTER.

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:41.899 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:44.535 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT'S WHAT'S

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:45.469 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WAY.

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:47.305 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:48.506 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION AND TO FINALLY HAVE

02:35:47.305 --> 02:35:50.508 region:rollup2
TIME WERE LYNSKEY WITH US FOR

02:35:48.506 --> 02:35:52.276 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

02:35:50.508 --> 02:35:53.945 region:rollup2
WARNING TOMALIN SKI SENIOR

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:55.780 region:rollup2
METEOROLOGIST WITH THE US FOREST

02:35:53.945 --> 02:36:04.956 region:rollup2
SERVICE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

02:35:55.780 --> 02:36:06.490 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

02:36:04.956 --> 02:36:08.259 region:rollup2
SOME GOING TO BE PRESENTING.

02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:10.027 region:rollup2
THE JUST A SHORT PRESENTATION

02:36:08.259 --> 02:36:11.929 region:rollup2
ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THAT

02:36:10.027 --> 02:36:17.435 region:rollup2
WILL BE AFFECTING OUR FIRE

02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:18.569 region:rollup2
SEASONS IN THE FUTURE.

02:36:17.435 --> 02:36:20.404 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO FIRST START OUT

02:36:18.569 --> 02:36:22.640 region:rollup2
PRINT WITH TALKING ABOUT THE

02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:24.375 region:rollup2
FACTS TALKING ABOUT A WHAT HAS

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.744 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CHANGED. OUR OUR

02:36:24.375 --> 02:36:28.079 region:rollup2
CLIMATE IS DEFINITELY CHANGING

02:36:26.744 --> 02:36:29.747 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WE'VE

02:36:28.079 --> 02:36:30.314 region:rollup2
I CAN NOT ONLY SEE THAT WITH THE

02:36:29.747 --> 02:36:32.483 region:rollup2
DATA BUT WE ALSO EXPERIENCE

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:34.886 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:36:32.483 --> 02:36:37.488 region:rollup2
I USE THIS PARTICULAR.

02:36:34.886 --> 02:36:39.557 region:rollup2
LOCATION UP BECAUSE I WORK IN

02:36:37.488 --> 02:36:40.157 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA BEEN

02:36:39.557 --> 02:36:43.194 region:rollup2
WORKING THERE FOR OVER TWENTY

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:44.729 region:rollup2
YEARS OUT WHAT YOUR SCENE IS.

02:36:43.194 --> 02:36:47.064 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATION.

02:36:44.729 --> 02:36:49.133 region:rollup2
TOTALS EARLY TOTALS ARE GOING

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:50.735 region:rollup2
BACK TO NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE SO

02:36:49.133 --> 02:36:54.272 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NINETY TWO YEARS OF.

02:36:50.735 --> 02:36:56.707 region:rollup2
OF UP PRECIPITATION OUR RECORDS

02:36:54.272 --> 02:36:57.975 region:rollup2
FOR THIS LOCATION AND IT'S HARD

02:36:56.707 --> 02:37:01.746 region:rollup2
TO SEE WITH THE.

02:36:57.975 --> 02:37:04.215 region:rollup2
THE THE ACTUAL VARIABILITY IN

02:37:01.746 --> 02:37:06.284 region:rollup2
THE HIGH ANNUAL PRECIPITATION

02:37:04.215 --> 02:37:07.985 region:rollup2
OTHERS A LOT OF VARIABILITY IT'S

02:37:06.284 --> 02:37:10.955 region:rollup2
OUR IT'S IT'S HARD TO SEE THE

02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:12.323 region:rollup2
ACTUAL TREND. ARE OVER THE LAST

02:37:10.955 --> 02:37:14.025 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO YEARS.

02:37:12.323 --> 02:37:15.993 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS A TREND.

02:37:14.025 --> 02:37:18.562 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A SLIGHT DOWNWARD

02:37:15.993 --> 02:37:19.163 region:rollup2
TREND OF ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.766 region:rollup2
THE LAST.

02:37:19.163 --> 02:37:24.135 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN NINETY TWO YEARS.

02:37:21.766 --> 02:37:25.536 region:rollup2
NOW AVERAGES ARE A TRICKY THING

02:37:24.135 --> 02:37:26.971 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE.

02:37:25.536 --> 02:37:28.506 region:rollup2
BASICALLY MADE UP NUMBERS

02:37:26.971 --> 02:37:29.407 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MADE UP OF.

02:37:28.506 --> 02:37:31.776 region:rollup2
THE.

02:37:29.407 --> 02:37:33.678 region:rollup2
HIGHS AND LOWS SO AGAIN THERE'S

02:37:31.776 --> 02:37:35.579 region:rollup2
A LOT OF VARIABILITY FROM YEAR

02:37:33.678 --> 02:37:37.348 region:rollup2
TO YEAR. OF BUT GENERALLY

02:37:35.579 --> 02:37:38.950 region:rollup2
SPEAKING THE AVERAGES HAVE GONE

02:37:37.348 --> 02:37:41.052 region:rollup2
DOWN OVER THE LAST.

02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:42.453 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED YEARS

02:37:41.052 --> 02:37:44.021 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT THIS PARTICULAR

02:37:42.453 --> 02:37:45.656 region:rollup2
LOCATION THERE'S A REASON WHY

02:37:44.021 --> 02:37:47.191 region:rollup2
I'M SHOWING YOU THIS.

02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:48.693 region:rollup2
INITIALLY HERE.

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:49.760 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK LOOK AT THE

02:37:48.693 --> 02:37:52.463 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THESE.

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:55.066 region:rollup2
MAPS YOU'RE QUITE QUICKLY UP

02:37:52.463 --> 02:37:56.734 region:rollup2
THE MAP ON THE LEFT IS SHOWING

02:37:55.066 --> 02:37:59.570 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT CLIMATE WE LOOK

02:37:56.734 --> 02:38:01.872 region:rollup2
AT THIRTY YEAR BLOCKS OF DATA

02:37:59.570 --> 02:38:04.275 region:rollup2
AND SO. ABOUT WHAT THE MAP ON

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:06.143 region:rollup2
THE LEFT IS SHOWING IS A THIRTY

02:38:04.275 --> 02:38:08.646 region:rollup2
YEAR BLOCK FROM NINETEENTH OF

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:10.314 region:rollup2
FIFTY TO NINETEEN EIGHTY.

02:38:08.646 --> 02:38:11.816 region:rollup2
AND THEN ANOTHER BLOCK FROM

02:38:10.314 --> 02:38:14.752 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TO TWO

02:38:11.816 --> 02:38:16.320 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN SO ARE WE COMPARED

02:38:14.752 --> 02:38:18.222 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ACTUAL DATA SO WE

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:21.559 region:rollup2
COMPARED THOSE TWO

02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:23.127 region:rollup2
CLIMATOLOGICAL PERIODS. SO OLD

02:38:21.559 --> 02:38:25.963 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY A SIXTY YEAR PERIOD

02:38:23.127 --> 02:38:27.264 region:rollup2
HOW PRECIPITATION IS CHANGED AND

02:38:25.963 --> 02:38:28.532 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:30.701 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT DRIER ACROSS

02:38:28.532 --> 02:38:32.336 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:33.904 region:rollup2
PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:38:32.336 --> 02:38:35.306 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN A LITTLE

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:36.474 region:rollup2
WETTER ACROSS THE CENTRAL

02:38:35.306 --> 02:38:38.075 region:rollup2
PORTIONS OF THE STATE AND THIS

02:38:36.474 --> 02:38:39.510 region:rollup2
IS THIS IS THESE ARE ACTUAL

02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:41.679 region:rollup2
RECORDS.

02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:43.681 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S TO

02:38:41.679 --> 02:38:44.749 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT BUT YOU CAN SEE THE

02:38:43.681 --> 02:38:46.484 region:rollup2
EXTREME DRYNESS IN THE NORTHERN

02:38:44.749 --> 02:38:48.919 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STATE.

02:38:46.484 --> 02:38:50.554 region:rollup2
THEN THE OTHER TWO MAPS THERE

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:52.156 region:rollup2
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SORT OF THE

02:38:50.554 --> 02:38:54.158 region:rollup2
WAY THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS

02:38:52.156 --> 02:38:55.926 region:rollup2
SAME TIME PERIOD DOING THE SAME

02:38:54.158 --> 02:38:57.762 region:rollup2
THING. ARE EXCEPT WE'RE LOOKING

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:58.329 region:rollup2
AT MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE DURING

02:38:57.762 --> 02:39:00.031 region:rollup2
THE SUMMER MONTHS SO YOU CAN

02:38:58.329 --> 02:39:01.799 region:rollup2
SEE.

02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:02.967 region:rollup2
A LOT AREAS PARTICULARLY CROSS

02:39:01.799 --> 02:39:04.969 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN

02:39:02.967 --> 02:39:06.804 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE GOTTEN WARMER

02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:08.339 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS A

02:39:06.804 --> 02:39:09.974 region:rollup2
LITTLE WETTER CROSS OF THE

02:39:08.339 --> 02:39:11.275 region:rollup2
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE STATE

02:39:09.974 --> 02:39:13.144 region:rollup2
OPTICALLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:39:11.275 --> 02:39:15.513 region:rollup2
VALLEY. AND NORTH OF THE BAY

02:39:13.144 --> 02:39:17.081 region:rollup2
AREA AND IN THE FAR RIGHT MAP

02:39:15.513 --> 02:39:18.949 region:rollup2
THERE IS THE SAME THING EXCEPT

02:39:17.081 --> 02:39:20.117 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT MINIMUM TEMPERATURES

02:39:18.949 --> 02:39:22.286 region:rollup2
DURING THE WINTER MONTHS.

02:39:20.117 --> 02:39:23.587 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE OVERALL WE'VE

02:39:22.286 --> 02:39:26.023 region:rollup2
SEEN MINIMUM TEMPERATURES

02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:27.391 region:rollup2
INCREASING A SIGNIFICANTLY

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:30.594 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OVER THE

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:31.962 region:rollup2
LAST. SIXTY YEARS.

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:33.964 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I'M GONNA GO THROUGHNOW

02:39:31.962 --> 02:39:36.567 region:rollup2
IS JUST THAT AGAIN VERY QUICKLY

02:39:33.964 --> 02:39:39.670 region:rollup2
HERE LOOKING THAT A A FEW SLIDES

02:39:36.567 --> 02:39:41.205 region:rollup2
OF. A CLIMATE CHANGE OR HOW ARE

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:42.673 region:rollup2
CLIMATE WILL BE CHANGING.

02:39:41.205 --> 02:39:45.276 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED CHANGES OVER THE

02:39:42.673 --> 02:39:46.811 region:rollup2
NEXT OF FIFTY YEARS OR SO. I

02:39:45.276 --> 02:39:47.378 region:rollup2
WENT THERE WHEN THE STATE JUST

02:39:46.811 --> 02:39:50.247 region:rollup2
ON THE.

02:39:47.378 --> 02:39:52.616 region:rollup2
VERY BEGINNING HERE IS THAT.

02:39:50.247 --> 02:39:55.553 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY MANY CLIMATE

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:57.655 region:rollup2
MODELS WE HAVE AT LEAST THIRTY.

02:39:55.553 --> 02:40:00.724 region:rollup2
GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS THAT HAVE

02:39:57.655 --> 02:40:01.692 region:rollup2
BEEN STATISTICALLY DOWNSCALED TO

02:40:00.724 --> 02:40:03.928 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REGIONS.

02:40:01.692 --> 02:40:05.696 region:rollup2
FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY

02:40:03.928 --> 02:40:07.698 region:rollup2
WE'VE SIMPLIFIED THE TH THE

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:09.366 region:rollup2
THIRTY MODELS WE'VE KIND OF

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:11.469 region:rollup2
BOILED IT DOWN TO TEN MORE

02:40:09.366 --> 02:40:13.671 region:rollup2
COMMON MODELS. AND WE'VE USED AN

02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:15.840 region:rollup2
UNSOLVABLE APPROACH SO BASICALLY

02:40:13.671 --> 02:40:17.775 region:rollup2
WILL WILL BE LOOKING THAT ARE

02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.043 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF AN ENSEMBLE A A

02:40:17.775 --> 02:40:20.177 region:rollup2
TEN MEMBER ENSEMBLE.

02:40:19.043 --> 02:40:23.013 region:rollup2
.

02:40:20.177 --> 02:40:25.249 region:rollup2
OF RESULT HERE ARE AVERAGE.

02:40:23.013 --> 02:40:27.818 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A PROJECTED.

02:40:25.249 --> 02:40:29.820 region:rollup2
ANNUAL PRECIPITATION BETWEEN

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:32.423 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:33.724 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE. AND AGAIN THIS IS

02:40:32.423 --> 02:40:35.392 region:rollup2
A SUMMATION OF TEN CLIMATE

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:36.727 region:rollup2
MODELS

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:38.162 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:40:36.727 --> 02:40:40.197 region:rollup2
MODELS INDIVIDUALLY THERE WOULD

02:40:38.162 --> 02:40:42.666 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE DIFFERENT RESULTS.

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:44.468 region:rollup2
NOT NOT TOO DIFFERENT BUT SOME

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:45.803 region:rollup2
OF THE SOME OF THE MEMBERS. ARE

02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:47.505 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY

02:40:45.803 --> 02:40:48.105 region:rollup2
SAY THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABILITY

02:40:47.505 --> 02:40:50.241 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE CLIMATE

02:40:48.105 --> 02:40:52.910 region:rollup2
MODELS I THINK SOME PEOPLE FAIL

02:40:50.241 --> 02:40:54.378 region:rollup2
TO SHOW SHOW THAT. BUT.

02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:57.548 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS THE.

02:40:54.378 --> 02:40:59.316 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE HERE OF THE TEN.

02:40:57.548 --> 02:41:01.318 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THEM MEMBERS SO

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:03.320 region:rollup2
AGAIN SHOWING ARE BASICALLY

02:41:01.318 --> 02:41:04.855 region:rollup2
GETTING WARMER ACROSS I'M SORRY

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.690 region:rollup2
GETTING DRIER CROSS OF THE

02:41:04.855 --> 02:41:08.559 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE AND

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:10.094 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THIS IS SHOWING. THAT

02:41:08.559 --> 02:41:11.962 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE GETTING WETTER

02:41:10.094 --> 02:41:13.831 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF

02:41:11.962 --> 02:41:16.767 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS IS OVER A

02:41:13.831 --> 02:41:18.435 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF ABOUT FIFTY YEARS.

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:20.204 region:rollup2
AND DOES THE TERM WETTER MEANS

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:22.006 region:rollup2
SNOW AND RAIN. HE OF

02:41:20.204 --> 02:41:23.274 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATION SO YES AT THE

02:41:22.006 --> 02:41:26.677 region:rollup2
HIGHER ELEVATIONS THAT WOULD

02:41:23.274 --> 02:41:29.446 region:rollup2
MEAN MORE SNOW.

02:41:26.677 --> 02:41:31.182 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH ARE.

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:32.750 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO OUR FIRE SEASONS

02:41:31.182 --> 02:41:34.685 region:rollup2
AS I WANTED TO BREAK THIS DOWN

02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:36.053 region:rollup2
INTO THE SPRING MONTHS IN THE

02:41:34.685 --> 02:41:38.222 region:rollup2
FALL MONTHS LOOKING THAT APRIL

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:39.723 region:rollup2
MAY JUNE PERIOD. SAME THING

02:41:38.222 --> 02:41:42.193 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY

02:41:39.723 --> 02:41:44.628 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE SAME AND SOME ALL.

02:41:42.193 --> 02:41:46.397 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HERE AGAIN SHOWING

02:41:44.628 --> 02:41:47.665 region:rollup2
DRIER CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH

02:41:46.397 --> 02:41:50.367 region:rollup2
AND ESSENTIALLY WEATHER

02:41:47.665 --> 02:41:53.037 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ACROSS A MUCH OF

02:41:50.367 --> 02:41:55.005 region:rollup2
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:41:53.037 --> 02:41:56.040 region:rollup2
NOW THIS IS.

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:57.241 region:rollup2
JERRY NOW THAT WAS DURING THE

02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:58.709 region:rollup2
SPRING MONTHS THIS IS DURING THE

02:41:57.241 --> 02:42:01.245 region:rollup2
FALL MONTHS.

02:41:58.709 --> 02:42:03.981 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER.

02:42:01.245 --> 02:42:05.749 region:rollup2
AGAIN DRYER NOW HERE OVER MUCH

02:42:03.981 --> 02:42:07.618 region:rollup2
OF OF THE STATE WITH THE

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:09.119 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION OF REALLY THE NORTHERN

02:42:07.618 --> 02:42:10.487 region:rollup2
A QUARTER OF NO MORE THAN A

02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:11.755 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE STATE. AND THERE'S

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:14.191 region:rollup2
A REASON WHY I AM SHOWING YOU

02:42:11.755 --> 02:42:15.626 region:rollup2
THIS AT ALL OMINOUS SUM ALL THIS

02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.094 region:rollup2
UP HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

02:42:15.626 --> 02:42:17.761 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS LOOKING AT

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:20.464 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES.

02:42:17.761 --> 02:42:22.199 region:rollup2
MEAN MAXIM TEMPERATURE MEAN

02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:25.302 region:rollup2
MINIMUM TEMPERATURE.

02:42:22.199 --> 02:42:26.870 region:rollup2
YOU CAN LOOK IT UP ARE OUR.

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:29.106 region:rollup2
LARGE VARIETY OF THESE.

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:30.441 region:rollup2
OF OF DIFFERENT MAPS DIFFERENT

02:42:29.106 --> 02:42:31.742 region:rollup2
TIME PERIODS.

02:42:30.441 --> 02:42:33.944 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:42:31.742 --> 02:42:35.646 region:rollup2
TIMES OF THE YEAR THIS ISN'T A

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:37.314 region:rollup2
VERY OF IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU A

02:42:35.646 --> 02:42:38.315 region:rollup2
VERY SIMPLE APPROACH HERE BUT

02:42:37.314 --> 02:42:40.284 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

02:42:38.315 --> 02:42:41.885 region:rollup2
ALL THE CLIMATE MODELS ARE

02:42:40.284 --> 02:42:43.754 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:42:41.885 --> 02:42:45.990 region:rollup2
WARMING UP AS JEFF IT.

02:42:43.754 --> 02:42:47.124 region:rollup2
JUST MENTIONED HERE ARE NO

02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:49.893 region:rollup2
DOUBT ABOUT IT THERE'S.

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:51.095 region:rollup2
STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS

02:42:49.893 --> 02:42:52.696 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:42:51.095 --> 02:42:54.431 region:rollup2
THAT OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:56.066 region:rollup2
WILL BE WARMING UP NOT ONLY OUR

02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:59.370 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES BUT OUR

02:42:56.066 --> 02:43:01.438 region:rollup2
MINIMUM TEMPERATURES AS WELL.

02:42:59.370 --> 02:43:03.307 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I'M GONNA KIND OF SUM

02:43:01.438 --> 02:43:04.975 region:rollup2
ALL THIS UP HERE KEVIN PAUL THIS

02:43:03.307 --> 02:43:06.610 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN JUST A MINUTE. OF

02:43:04.975 --> 02:43:06.944 region:rollup2
THE NORTH AMERICAN MONSOON THE

02:43:06.610 --> 02:43:10.180 region:rollup2
NAM.

02:43:06.944 --> 02:43:11.548 region:rollup2
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:14.251 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT.

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:15.919 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS CIRCULATION SYSTEM

02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:17.421 region:rollup2
THAT DEVELOPS ACROSS THE DESERT

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:19.189 region:rollup2
SOUTHWEST.

02:43:17.421 --> 02:43:21.925 region:rollup2
OVER THE SUMMER TIME AND OF

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:23.761 region:rollup2
BASICALLY BRINGS OUR LIGHTNING

02:43:21.925 --> 02:43:26.430 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY TO CALIFORNIA OTHER

02:43:23.761 --> 02:43:28.065 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE NORTH

02:43:26.430 --> 02:43:30.234 region:rollup2
AMERICAN MONSOON WILL HAVE A

02:43:28.065 --> 02:43:31.535 region:rollup2
WEAKER SIGNAL OVER THE COMING

02:43:30.234 --> 02:43:32.670 region:rollup2
DECADES ACROSS THE DESERT

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:34.772 region:rollup2
SOUTHWEST.

02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:36.607 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THAT IMPLY THAT IMPLIES

02:43:34.772 --> 02:43:38.642 region:rollup2
THAT WE'LL BE SEEING LESS

02:43:36.607 --> 02:43:41.478 region:rollup2
LIGHTNING ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA

02:43:38.642 --> 02:43:43.280 region:rollup2
IN THE DECADES AHEAD?

02:43:41.478 --> 02:43:44.415 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THIS IS FIRE ACTIVITY.

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:46.583 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:43:44.415 --> 02:43:48.285 region:rollup2
JUST SHOWING THE FACTS HERE

02:43:46.583 --> 02:43:48.819 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THIS IS NUMBER OF ACRES

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:50.721 region:rollup2
BURNED OVER THE LAST SIXTY

02:43:48.819 --> 02:43:52.923 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:43:50.721 --> 02:43:54.825 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:55.893 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY YOU

02:43:54.825 --> 02:43:57.561 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THERE IS DEFINITELY BEEN

02:43:55.893 --> 02:44:00.164 region:rollup2
AN UPWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF

02:43:57.561 --> 02:44:01.965 region:rollup2
ACRES BURNED BY WILDFIRES.

02:44:00.164 --> 02:44:03.801 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:44:01.965 --> 02:44:06.437 region:rollup2
IF WE TAKE THAT SAME DATA AND

02:44:03.801 --> 02:44:08.072 region:rollup2
JUST APPLY A.

02:44:06.437 --> 02:44:09.440 region:rollup2
A TREND.

02:44:08.072 --> 02:44:12.176 region:rollup2
BASED UPON THE.

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:14.445 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT TREND YOU CAN SEE

02:44:12.176 --> 02:44:17.181 region:rollup2
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE

02:44:14.445 --> 02:44:19.750 region:rollup2
OUR IN THE YEARS AHEAD. ARE IN

02:44:17.181 --> 02:44:21.552 region:rollup2
TERMS OF NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED.

02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:23.253 region:rollup2
OKAY

02:44:21.552 --> 02:44:24.521 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S WHERE I WANNA COME TO

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:26.023 region:rollup2
PULL ALL THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:27.991 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWED A LOT OF.

02:44:26.023 --> 02:44:29.993 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MAPS AND AND.

02:44:27.991 --> 02:44:31.028 region:rollup2
FIGURES AND SO FORTH ONE OF THE

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:32.730 region:rollup2
FACTS IN THIS IS REALLY

02:44:31.028 --> 02:44:33.897 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE

02:44:32.730 --> 02:44:36.133 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND HOW THAT.

02:44:33.897 --> 02:44:37.634 region:rollup2
WILL IMPACT OUR FIRE SEASONS IN

02:44:36.133 --> 02:44:39.303 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

02:44:37.634 --> 02:44:41.138 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE FACTS THE FACTS ARE

02:44:39.303 --> 02:44:42.206 region:rollup2
THAT MAXIM MINIMUM TEMPERATURES

02:44:41.138 --> 02:44:43.273 region:rollup2
ARE IN IT THAT?

02:44:42.206 --> 02:44:45.309 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN INCREASING OVER

02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:47.911 region:rollup2
THE LAST.

02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:49.780 region:rollup2
SIXTY YEARS WE SEE THAT WE

02:44:47.911 --> 02:44:51.849 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAN MEASURE THAT WE

02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:53.050 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN. WE ALL

02:44:51.849 --> 02:44:55.452 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S GETTING WARMER.

02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:57.855 region:rollup2
IT'S GETTING DRIER ACROSS.

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:58.355 region:rollup2
MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA CHECK

02:44:57.855 --> 02:45:00.224 region:rollup2
WITH THE NORTHERN PART

02:44:58.355 --> 02:45:02.426 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:45:00.224 --> 02:45:04.194 region:rollup2
AS WELL AGAIN WE EXPERIENCE THAT

02:45:02.426 --> 02:45:05.462 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE. OF THE

02:45:04.194 --> 02:45:07.498 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED I JUST

02:45:05.462 --> 02:45:09.566 region:rollup2
SHOWED YOU ON THAT'S A FACT

02:45:07.498 --> 02:45:12.169 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER OF ACRES ARE

02:45:09.566 --> 02:45:13.871 region:rollup2
INCREASING A DETOUR WILDFIRES

02:45:12.169 --> 02:45:14.304 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING BURNED.

02:45:13.871 --> 02:45:16.340 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT'S REALLY

02:45:14.304 --> 02:45:18.041 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:22.045 region:rollup2
IS THAT MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:22.379 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES ARE HUMAN CAUSED.

02:45:22.045 --> 02:45:23.947 region:rollup2
OKAY I'M INTO.

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:24.581 region:rollup2
.

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:26.583 region:rollup2
BRING THIS HOME HERE IN JUST A

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:29.486 region:rollup2
SECOND. ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY

02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:32.156 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR WILDFIRES IN THE

02:45:29.486 --> 02:45:32.623 region:rollup2
SIERRA AND EVEN MORE OF A HIGHER

02:45:32.156 --> 02:45:34.658 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE IN NORTHERN

02:45:32.623 --> 02:45:36.393 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ARE CAUSED BY

02:45:34.658 --> 02:45:39.229 region:rollup2
LIGHTNING BUT BY AND LARGE MOST

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:39.863 region:rollup2
OF OUR FIRES ACROSS THE SORT OF

02:45:39.229 --> 02:45:41.865 region:rollup2
THE THE.

02:45:39.863 --> 02:45:46.336 region:rollup2
MORE POPULATED AREAS OF

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:47.104 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARE HUMAN RELATED.

02:45:46.336 --> 02:45:49.606 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S SOME QUESTIONS

02:45:47.104 --> 02:45:52.042 region:rollup2
SENATOR.

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:54.378 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MOST OF ARE WILD FIRES

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:56.447 region:rollup2
ARE HUMAN RELATED.

02:45:54.378 --> 02:45:57.848 region:rollup2
HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE?

02:45:56.447 --> 02:45:59.516 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WITHOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

02:45:57.848 --> 02:46:01.151 region:rollup2
HOW ARE THESE THINGS GOING TO

02:45:59.516 --> 02:46:03.353 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. OUR

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:05.689 region:rollup2
POPULATION ACROSS THE STATE THE

02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:07.791 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS.

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:10.160 region:rollup2
HUMAN BEHAVIOR HOW WILL CLIMATE

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:11.628 region:rollup2
CHANGE IMPACTS HUMAN BEHAVIOR

02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.931 region:rollup2
ARE CONDO ME. OTHER

02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:15.999 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:46:13.931 --> 02:46:17.901 region:rollup2
AND THEN CHANGES TO THE WILDLAND

02:46:15.999 --> 02:46:19.937 region:rollup2
URBAN INTERFACE REGIONS ACROSS

02:46:17.901 --> 02:46:21.438 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HOWARD THOSE THINGS

02:46:19.937 --> 02:46:22.840 region:rollup2
GOING TO CHANGE.

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:24.942 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE

02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:26.477 region:rollup2
DECADES AHEAD CLIMATE CHANGE

02:46:24.942 --> 02:46:28.445 region:rollup2
WILL CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON

02:46:26.477 --> 02:46:30.747 region:rollup2
THAT. BUT REGARDLESS THOSE

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:32.683 region:rollup2
THINGS WILL CHANGE REGARDLESS OF

02:46:30.747 --> 02:46:33.851 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER WE HAVE A CHANGES IN

02:46:32.683 --> 02:46:35.552 region:rollup2
OUR TEMPERATURE PRECIPITATION

02:46:33.851 --> 02:46:38.222 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH.

02:46:35.552 --> 02:46:39.756 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THESE CHANGES ARE

02:46:38.222 --> 02:46:41.792 region:rollup2
GOING IN OUR POPULATION HOW

02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:44.061 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEHAVE.

02:46:41.792 --> 02:46:46.063 region:rollup2
OUT WHERE PEOPLE MOVE. A ARE

02:46:44.061 --> 02:46:47.297 region:rollup2
GOING TO IMPACT OUR FIRE SEASONS

02:46:46.063 --> 02:46:49.366 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE. IN A SIGNIFICANT

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:51.602 region:rollup2
WAY.

02:46:49.366 --> 02:46:52.836 region:rollup2
SO.

02:46:51.602 --> 02:46:54.404 region:rollup2
ARE JUST LOOKING AT SOME

02:46:52.836 --> 02:46:56.807 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS SO WE CAN MAKE SOME

02:46:54.404 --> 02:46:59.877 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON WHAT

02:46:56.807 --> 02:47:00.844 region:rollup2
WE A CAN ANTICIPATE WITH. A

02:46:59.877 --> 02:47:02.813 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND

02:47:00.844 --> 02:47:05.115 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATION THE REASON WHY I

02:47:02.813 --> 02:47:06.884 region:rollup2
SHOWED YOU. WHAT HAS ALREADY

02:47:05.115 --> 02:47:08.485 region:rollup2
OCCURRED AT THE VERY BEGINNING

02:47:06.884 --> 02:47:11.321 region:rollup2
OF MY PRESENTATION?

02:47:08.485 --> 02:47:12.923 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT GIVES CREDENCE TO A

02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:15.192 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY TO.

02:47:12.923 --> 02:47:15.859 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE CLIMATE MODELS

02:47:15.192 --> 02:47:17.461 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROJECTING THESE

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:19.062 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THE FUTURE SO IT'S A

02:47:17.461 --> 02:47:20.230 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT LOOK AT WHAT HAS

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:21.798 region:rollup2
HAPPENED BECAUSE THAT NOT ONLY

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:24.167 region:rollup2
GETS ITS CONTEXT BUT IT ALSO

02:47:21.798 --> 02:47:25.535 region:rollup2
GIVES US. A CREDIBILITY FOR

02:47:24.167 --> 02:47:27.704 region:rollup2
THESE CLIMATE MODEL SO

02:47:25.535 --> 02:47:28.972 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY AGAIN MAXIMUM

02:47:27.704 --> 02:47:31.208 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES ARE PROJECTED TO BE

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:32.709 region:rollup2
INCREASING ACROSS THE REGION.

02:47:31.208 --> 02:47:34.177 region:rollup2
OUR ANNUAL PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS

02:47:32.709 --> 02:47:36.246 region:rollup2
ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE OVER

02:47:34.177 --> 02:47:37.347 region:rollup2
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE.

02:47:36.246 --> 02:47:38.882 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY INCREASE OVER

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:40.183 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF THE

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:41.885 region:rollup2
SPRING AND THE FALL MONTHS ARE

02:47:40.183 --> 02:47:43.720 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO BE DRIER OVER

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:44.655 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF SOUTHERN PORTIONS

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:45.889 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

02:47:44.655 --> 02:47:46.990 region:rollup2
THE NORTH AMERICAN MONTHS SINCE

02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:49.393 region:rollup2
SIGNAL IS.

02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:50.794 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO BE WEAKER WITH WEST

02:47:49.393 --> 02:47:52.429 region:rollup2
OF LIGHTNING ACTIVITY.

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:54.131 region:rollup2
DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS

02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:55.699 region:rollup2
OTHER DROUGHT FREQUENCY AND

02:47:54.131 --> 02:47:57.167 region:rollup2
INTENSITY MAY INCREASE OUR TREE

02:47:55.699 --> 02:47:59.670 region:rollup2
MORTALITY MAY BECOME MORE

02:47:57.167 --> 02:48:01.171 region:rollup2
COMMONPLACE. IN FUEL LOADING MAY

02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:02.839 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE NORTH.

02:48:01.171 --> 02:48:05.075 region:rollup2
BUT DECREASE IN THE SOUTH SO

02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:05.943 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF.

02:48:05.075 --> 02:48:08.111 region:rollup2
LIKE CITY TO.

02:48:05.943 --> 02:48:09.980 region:rollup2
TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:11.748 region:rollup2
CHANGE ARE OVER THE STATE OF

02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:14.318 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CUT

02:48:11.748 --> 02:48:16.453 region:rollup2
AND DRY.

02:48:14.318 --> 02:48:18.722 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE HERE.

02:48:16.453 --> 02:48:20.090 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS I THINK THE LENGTH

02:48:18.722 --> 02:48:21.992 region:rollup2
OF OUR FIRE SEASON.

02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:23.894 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT BEING

02:48:21.992 --> 02:48:25.262 region:rollup2
AS SEEN IT INCREASING I THINK

02:48:23.894 --> 02:48:26.964 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO INCREASE FURTHER

02:48:25.262 --> 02:48:28.999 region:rollup2
IN THE SOUTH. DOES THAT MEAN

02:48:26.964 --> 02:48:30.467 region:rollup2
EVERY FIRE SEASON FROM HERE ON

02:48:28.999 --> 02:48:32.102 region:rollup2
OUT IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAN

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:33.804 region:rollup2
THE NEXT NOW.

02:48:32.102 --> 02:48:34.504 region:rollup2
WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE

02:48:33.804 --> 02:48:36.473 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:48:34.504 --> 02:48:37.774 region:rollup2
THAT VARIABILITY CONTINUE BUT

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:40.077 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UPWARD

02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:41.545 region:rollup2
TREND I THINK IN IN TERMS OF OUR

02:48:40.077 --> 02:48:43.113 region:rollup2
FIRE SEASONS BECOMING LONGER.

02:48:41.545 --> 02:48:44.648 region:rollup2
OPTICALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN

02:48:43.113 --> 02:48:45.749 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE POTENTIAL

02:48:44.648 --> 02:48:47.651 region:rollup2
FOR MORE NGUYEN RELATED

02:48:45.749 --> 02:48:49.319 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES DURING THE FALL MONTHS

02:48:47.651 --> 02:48:51.521 region:rollup2
OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHY DO

02:48:49.319 --> 02:48:52.823 region:rollup2
I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:54.591 region:rollup2
THOSE CLIMATE MODELS.

02:48:52.823 --> 02:48:57.194 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE PROJECTING DRIER

02:48:54.591 --> 02:48:58.261 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS IN THE FALL DURING A

02:48:57.194 --> 02:48:59.930 region:rollup2
ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:01.732 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:48:59.930 --> 02:49:02.666 region:rollup2
SO OUR SANTA ANA WINDS ARE A

02:49:01.732 --> 02:49:04.368 region:rollup2
FREQUENT VISITOR.

02:49:02.666 --> 02:49:07.070 region:rollup2
TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:49:04.368 --> 02:49:08.238 region:rollup2
FALL. SO WE WOULD IMPLY THIS

02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:10.107 region:rollup2
WOULD IMPLY THAT WE WOULD SEE

02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:11.608 region:rollup2
MORE NGUYEN RELATED FIRE

02:49:10.107 --> 02:49:13.076 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY IN THE FALL AND SO THE

02:49:11.608 --> 02:49:14.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. OTHER WEIGHT THE

02:49:13.076 --> 02:49:15.746 region:rollup2
FIRE SEASON NAY CHANGED LITTLE

02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:16.580 region:rollup2
IN THE NORTH BECAUSE.

02:49:15.746 --> 02:49:18.915 region:rollup2
IT.

02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:20.283 region:rollup2
OF THE PROJECTED WEATHER

02:49:18.915 --> 02:49:22.219 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ACROSS NORTHERN

02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:24.087 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OTHER MAYBE FEWER

02:49:22.219 --> 02:49:25.088 region:rollup2
LIGHTNING RELATED FIRES IN THE

02:49:24.087 --> 02:49:26.456 region:rollup2
SIERRA AND OVER NORTHERN

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:29.159 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:49:26.456 --> 02:49:30.394 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE SEVERE

02:49:29.159 --> 02:49:30.994 region:rollup2
FIRES IN THE SOUTH.

02:49:30.394 --> 02:49:32.629 region:rollup2
THAT'S POSSIBLE DUE TO DRIER

02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:33.697 region:rollup2
FUEL CONDITIONS

02:49:32.629 --> 02:49:35.699 region:rollup2
AND FIRE BEHAVIOR.

02:49:33.697 --> 02:49:37.267 region:rollup2
MAY BECOME MORE EXTREME

02:49:35.699 --> 02:49:38.869 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH AGAIN

02:49:37.267 --> 02:49:41.138 region:rollup2
JUST DUE TO THOSE CRIER FUEL

02:49:38.869 --> 02:49:42.439 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS A SCENE ACTIVITY LIKE

02:49:41.138 --> 02:49:44.775 region:rollup2
A WHAT WE DID IT WITH THE THOMAS

02:49:42.439 --> 02:49:46.309 region:rollup2
FIRE. AND SOME OF OUR.

02:49:44.775 --> 02:49:47.811 region:rollup2
STATION FIRES ANOTHER.

02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:49.880 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:49:47.811 --> 02:49:52.416 region:rollup2
OF SOME SIGNIFICANT FIRE

02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:52.916 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY IN THE SOUTH.

02:49:52.416 --> 02:49:54.384 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE END OF MY

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:57.554 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

02:49:54.384 --> 02:49:58.121 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH COME

02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:59.156 region:rollup2
ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF BEEN

02:49:58.121 --> 02:50:01.692 region:rollup2
VERY.

02:49:59.156 --> 02:50:03.627 region:rollup2
HELPFUL AND TO PROVIDE US WITH

02:50:01.692 --> 02:50:05.629 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT

02:50:03.627 --> 02:50:07.297 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE NEED TO TO MOVE

02:50:05.629 --> 02:50:08.799 region:rollup2
FORWARD DATA MS LIMO DID YOU

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:09.800 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

02:50:08.799 --> 02:50:12.002 region:rollup2
THEN WHY DON'T WE.

02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:13.003 region:rollup2
EXCUSE OUR PANEL AND ASK IF

02:50:12.002 --> 02:50:13.503 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

02:50:13.003 --> 02:50:25.215 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO

02:50:13.503 --> 02:50:27.451 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

02:50:25.215 --> 02:50:35.692 region:rollup2
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

02:50:27.451 --> 02:50:36.593 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.961 region:rollup2
PAUL MASON AT THE STATE FOREST

02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:39.262 region:rollup2
TRUST NICE WANTED TO REINFORCE A

02:50:37.961 --> 02:50:40.997 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:41.932 region:rollup2
CAN GET. QUITE ENOUGH ATTENTION

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:43.867 region:rollup2
DURING THE EXCELLENT

02:50:41.932 --> 02:50:45.602 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS EARLIER. ONE IS

02:50:43.867 --> 02:50:48.371 region:rollup2
THAT ASWE'RE LOOKING AT OUR

02:50:45.602 --> 02:50:49.172 region:rollup2
FORESTED LANDSCAPES AGO AS WELL

02:50:48.371 --> 02:50:50.574 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE DEALING

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:52.342 region:rollup2
WITH THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE

02:50:50.574 --> 02:50:54.177 region:rollup2
WAY TOO MANY SMALL TREES NOT

02:50:52.342 --> 02:50:56.713 region:rollup2
NEARLY ENOUGH LARGE TREES. YOU

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:57.981 region:rollup2
KNOW CONSEQUENCES THE PAST

02:50:56.713 --> 02:50:59.316 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT FIRE SUPPRESSION.

02:50:57.981 --> 02:51:00.584 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE GOING IN AND THINNING

02:50:59.316 --> 02:51:02.119 region:rollup2
AND DOING OTHER THINGS TO READ

02:51:00.584 --> 02:51:03.687 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED FIRE TO REDUCE THE

02:51:02.119 --> 02:51:06.123 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF SMALL TREES.

02:51:03.687 --> 02:51:07.791 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA TAKE A DELIBERATE.

02:51:06.123 --> 02:51:09.392 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION TO MITCHELL

02:51:07.791 --> 02:51:10.927 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RECRUITING LARGE TREES

02:51:09.392 --> 02:51:12.262 region:rollup2
AS WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:12.462 region:rollup2
BY MAGIC THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO

02:51:12.262 --> 02:51:14.898 region:rollup2
REAP.

02:51:12.462 --> 02:51:15.832 region:rollup2
WORK WITH LANDOWNERS TO DEVELOP

02:51:14.898 --> 02:51:17.400 region:rollup2
THAT CHARACTERISTIC ON THE

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:18.268 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE.

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:19.970 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:51:18.268 --> 02:51:21.071 region:rollup2
FOR LONG TERM WATERSHED FUNCTION

02:51:19.970 --> 02:51:22.839 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH THIS LAST

02:51:21.071 --> 02:51:24.074 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION REALLY HIT HOME. IS

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:25.475 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO GET THESE

02:51:24.074 --> 02:51:26.710 region:rollup2
WATERSHEDS WHERE IT'S GOING TO

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:28.145 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE MOISTURE IN THE

02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:30.180 region:rollup2
FUTURE INTO THE BEST POSSIBLE

02:51:28.145 --> 02:51:31.715 region:rollup2
CONDITION IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME

02:51:30.180 --> 02:51:33.884 region:rollup2
SECURITY ABOUT WERE CALIFORNIA'S

02:51:31.715 --> 02:51:35.619 region:rollup2
WATER CAN BE COMING FROM. BY THE

02:51:33.884 --> 02:51:36.753 region:rollup2
SECOND HALF OF THE CENTURY

02:51:35.619 --> 02:51:37.320 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

02:51:36.753 --> 02:51:38.421 region:rollup2
WARMER AND THINGS ARE IN THE

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:39.890 region:rollup2
DRYER.

02:51:38.421 --> 02:51:40.457 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR ALL

02:51:39.890 --> 02:51:42.859 region:rollup2
OF THESE.

02:51:40.457 --> 02:51:43.660 region:rollup2
LARGE SCALE PROJECTS

02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:44.594 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THE

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:46.596 region:rollup2
MY ORGANIZATION PACIFIC FOR

02:51:44.594 --> 02:51:48.365 region:rollup2
STRESS DOES A LOT OF IT'S REALLY

02:51:46.596 --> 02:51:49.599 region:rollup2
HARD WHEN THE SOURCES OF FUNDING

02:51:48.365 --> 02:51:51.134 region:rollup2
FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT

02:51:49.599 --> 02:51:52.702 region:rollup2
STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. WHEN

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:54.104 region:rollup2
THERE'S MONEY ONE YEAR IN THE

02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:55.005 region:rollup2
NOT MONEY THE NEXT YEAR.

02:51:54.104 --> 02:51:56.439 region:rollup2
GETTING TO A POINT WHERE WE

02:51:55.005 --> 02:51:58.074 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE DEDICATED STATE

02:51:56.439 --> 02:52:00.243 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FOR ADDRESSING THIS

02:51:58.074 --> 02:52:02.212 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OVER THEM COMING.

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:02.979 region:rollup2
FRANKLY DECADES IS GONNA BE A

02:52:02.212 --> 02:52:05.215 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

02:52:02.979 --> 02:52:07.284 region:rollup2
SOLUTION. AND LASTLY I WOULD

02:52:05.215 --> 02:52:09.486 region:rollup2
JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT.

02:52:07.284 --> 02:52:11.221 region:rollup2
A THESE ARE ALL FOREST FIRES AS

02:52:09.486 --> 02:52:12.622 region:rollup2
MS LIMON POINTED OUT LOVE THIS

02:52:11.221 --> 02:52:14.291 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AND AREAS OF THE STATE

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:15.959 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOMINATED BY CHAPARRAL

02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:17.027 region:rollup2
AND GRASSLAND DINO FRANKLY THE

02:52:15.959 --> 02:52:19.129 region:rollup2
FIRES AND NAPA WERE LARGELY THAT

02:52:17.027 --> 02:52:20.764 region:rollup2
CONTEXT AS WELL. WE ABSOLUTELY

02:52:19.129 --> 02:52:21.765 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE GETTING A GRIP ON ALL
