SENATE CABALLERO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SB FOUR SEVENTY TWO WHICH PROVIDE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNED PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED PAYDAY FOR A SINGLE FIXED FEE OFTEN LESS THAN A TYPICAL BANK. OVERDRAFT FEE OR A LATE FEE. WHETHER IT'S THE KEVIN AND NICK COVER AN UNEXPECTED COST OR JUST AVOID A LATE FEE SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY. BY CREATING THIS STATUTORY FRAMEWORK CONSUMERS CAN GET THEIR MONEY WHEN THEY NEED IT IT IS A TOOL AND COMES WITH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HELD HARMLESS. THERE IS NO DEBT CREATED BECAUSE A CONSUMER IS ACCESSING THEIR OWN EARNED ON PAID INCOME. THEREFORE THERE IS NO DEBT COLLECTION AND NO LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF NON PAYMENT. THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGE THERE IS NO REPORTING OF A NON PAYMENT TO A CREDIT BUREAU AND A CONSUMERS CREDIT SCORE IS NOT THE BASIS FOR PARTICIPATING. AND SINCE IT'S NOT A LOAN USERS CANNOT DEFAULT AND THERE IS NO COMPOUNDING INTEREST. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION GROUPS TO FINE TUNE THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WHICH HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES. AND FINALLY THERE IS FINALLY A SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO HIGH COST PREDATORY LOANS AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CAP IRO MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

I RISE ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO PRESENT SB TO AWAIT A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL AIMED AT PREVENTING ROBO CALL SCAMS. ROBO CALL SCAMS FOR THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER COMPLAINT IN THE NATION. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION FRAUD GENERATES THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS TO THE COMMISSION AND 70% OF SCAMS PART OVER THE TELEPHONE. SPOOFING. ESPECIALLY NEIGHBOR SPOOFING IS KEY TO MAKING THESE SCAMS WORK THE VOLUME OF SPOOFED CALLS IS INCREASING. EXPERTS ESTIMATE THE BY 202040% OF EVERY CALL MADE IN YOUR TELEPHONE WILL BE A SCAM OR A SPOOF IN CALL AIMED AT DEFRAUDING THE CONSUMER. NEIGHBORHOOD -- NAY THIS BILL SETS A JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO IMPLEMENT CALLER ID AUTHENTICATION MEMBER MEASURES. WHICH CAN HELP IDENTIFY THE LEGAL ROBO CALLS AND PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM BEING SCAMMED. WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO? IT DOES NOT SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE CPU SEES AUTHORITY. IT NARROWLY ALLOWS THE CPUC TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ILLEGAL ROBO CALLERS. IT ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE CALL BLOCKING [inaudible] AND THIS WAS A NUMBER ONE QUESTION THE COMMITTEE WHETHER THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CALL BLOCKING NO IT DOES NOT AND IT WOULD NOT RESULT. IN CALLS BEING BLOCKED IT ALSO DOES NOT CREATE SIGNIFICANT NEW LIABILITIES FOR TELECOMS ONLY THOSE THAT DO NOT IMPLEMENT A CALLER ID. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM. ONLY THOSE THAT DON'T WILL BE IN VIOLATION WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT WAS HELL IT WOULD HELP TO RESTORE CONSUMERS CONFIDENCE IN USING THEIR PHONES WITHOUT BEING SCAMS SCAM.
