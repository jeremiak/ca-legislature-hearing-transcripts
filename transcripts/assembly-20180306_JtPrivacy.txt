A GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE AND I LIKE TO START OUT BY WELCOMING ALL OF YOU TO THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ALSO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. AND INNOVATION. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS. FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE HERE TODAY. ANDUP THIS PATIENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK GOD THE AUDIENCE. FOR JOINING US. AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES AND NOW THEY WILL BE MORE COMING. HAS SO WE PROGRESS. WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION. BECAUSE IT IS HOME TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST TECHNOLOGY CORPORATIONS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE TRANSFORM OUR LIVES FROM THE WAY WE WORK TO HOW WE COMMUNICATE. AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH EACH PASSING DAY. BUT THE VERY PROMISES OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ALSO CHALLENGED US. TO FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM IMPACT THEY CAN HAVE ON SOCIETY. AND WHAT THESE POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST THEIR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AS A RESULT OUR APPROACH TO TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE STATE. HOUSE THE POTENTIAL OF NOT ONLY INFORMING THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD AS WELL. ONE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY. GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR A AYE. A I IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS A LINE AROUND THE CONCEPT OF CREATING COMPUTER PROGRAMS OR MACHINES CAPABLE OF INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR. SIMILAR TO THAT EXHIBITED BY HUMANS. AS NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER A AYE HOUSE IN INCREDIBLE ABILITY. CREATE A GLOBAL PARADIGM SHIFT. THAT MAY PROPEL SOCIETY INTO AN AUTOMATION AGE. AND PROPOSED UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST PROBLEMS. BUT IT ALSO COMES WITH ITS OWN WRISTS. INCLUDING DISPLACING WORKERS BIAS ALL LOSS OF PRIVACY AMONG OTHER THINGS. AS A RESULT A I WILL POST LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONCERNS THAT WILL REQUIRE INVOLVEMENT. FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS. WE AS LEGISLATORS MUST FACILITATE DOT DIALOGUE. FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN. PROTECTING OUR STATE POPULATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DRIVING INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY. AS A LEADER IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. THIS HEARING IS INTENDED TO DO JUST THAT. IT WILL EXAMINE THE PROMISES AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A AYE. HOW OVERALL ENDEAVOR IS TO PROVIDE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES? STAFF AND THE PUBLIC. WITH THE GENERAL AND BALANCE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A AYE IS. HOW IT WILL SHIFT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC? LABOR SOCIAL LANDSCAPE OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. AND ALSO HOW THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BEGIN. PAIR TO THINK ABOUT AND ADDRESS. OR NOT ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF A AYE APPLICATIONS. IN DETERMINING HOW WE OPPOSE THIS COMPLEX AND EMERGING ISSUE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HEAR FROM. KEY ACADEMICS INDUSTRIAL EXPERTS GOVERNMENTAL LIAISONS AND ALSO CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES. I LOOK FOR TO A ROBUST AND INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION THAT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE AND CREATES GREATER AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING ON THE ISSUE OF A AYE. NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. AND THE ARE ATTHIS TIME I LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR MEMBERS TO. ON MAKE OPENING REMARKS SO WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. A MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO MAY I ON THIS MICROPHONE. BUT HARD TAKE YOU FOR CAN ACTUALLY HEARING. I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND IT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WHERE THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRANSFER MORE A TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY AND OUR GOVERNMENT AND THEIR CATALYZED BY RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN A AYE? IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A AYE IS JUST NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AFFECTING OUR DAILY LIVES ONE WHEN I WAS DOING RESEARCH IT ON A AYE AT CALTECH IN YOU LEADER UCLA. A I WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD SOLVE A SIMPLE PROBLEM OVERNIGHT RUNNING ON A ROOM SIZED COMPUTER AND NOW. WE ALL CARRY AROUND IN OUR POCKET DEVICES. THAT WE CAN SAY HEY SEERY PLACE SOME BEATLES AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT GOES INTO FOR FILLING THAT REQUEST. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE JUST BOGGLES THE MIND EVEN THIRTY YEARS AGO SO. THOSE COULD HAVE SOME VERY POSITIVE IMPACTS ON OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR SOCIETY BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S FRAUGHT WITH PERIL IN CHALLENGES FOR US. AS WE EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IMPACT PRIVACY OTHER WAYS IMPACT GOVERNANCE AND. THE WAYS THAT IMPACT MORALITY IN OUR SOCIETY SO I THINK IT'S A VERY. IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR US TO BE STRESSING THE LEGISLATURE AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER ACCARDO THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK THE CHAIR AND. VICE CHAIR FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT LEAST I TRY TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER I MEAN I THINK APPROACHING THIS FROM A STANDPOINT OF WORKFORCE AND WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF. IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT THAT MEANS OFF FOR OUR ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD IN THAT STATE OF THAT AS CALIFORNIA AND AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE. AND HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT FOSTERS CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. BUT THERE'S ALSO REAL CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE TAKING THE ROLE THAT WAS ONCE FILLED BY AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER CHALLENGES ARE THAT WE'RE FACING AS A STATE. WHAT DOES THAT DO? YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. EITHER HELPING OR OR EXACERBATING THIS PROBLEM. AND WHAT YOU KNOW IS BEING DONE OR COULD CAN BE DONE TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. TO TO TRY TO HELP US SOLVE THESE ISSUES ARE AND AND MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR FOLKS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO THIS ISSUE I MEAN THAT AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT. DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE I A I THAT YOU KNOW HOW MY COLLEAGUE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S IN OUR PHONE WHICH IS MORE. I TO ME PROGRAMS AND PREDICTIVE AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT'S LITERALLY THINKING ON ITS OWN AND AND AND AND THE AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT. AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTAIN A CONTROL THAT. AS A PUT IT AS IT COMES TO PRIVACY IN DIFFERENT. NOT PROTECTIONS ARE THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT TO HAVE SO THESE REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATION OBVIOUSLY IS A STATE ONE CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN THIS ISSUE. BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS IS GONNA CONTINUE TO BE A MORE AND MORE SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT FOOTPRINT. UP HERE WHAT DAY AND I THINK EVERYBODY WHO'S I SHOW UP IN. PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER OPENING REMARKS I LIKE TO. WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL SPEAKER WHO WILL PROVIDE US WITH SOME BACKGROUND AND SPEAK TO THE APPLICATIONS OF A AYE TECHNOLOGY NOW. AND INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO YEAH PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME PROFESSOR ALL OF GRAFF PHD AT HOLD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL. AT UC BERKELEY A BRICK AND WAITS AND DAHLE CAMBRIAN A AYE. WELCOME PROFESSOR. MUCH. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY THANK YOU DEAR. CHAIRMAN CHAO YOUR MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY IS BOTH A PLEASURE. AND THE PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE AND HELP IN THIS. VERY IMPORTANT EXPLORATION OF THEIRS OF VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WERE THAT WERE FACING. AND I CALLED A PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HARNESS THE POWER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHILE. ABOUNDING IN SHAPING. THE CHALLENGES THAT IT OFFERS. TO WE ARE INDEED AT THE THRESHOLD AT THE MOMENT. BETWEEN. A AYE BEING. A. NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT PROMISES SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND THE I ALSO CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN SOCIETY. WE ARE TORN BETWEEN. THE HUMILITY OF SCIENTISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP PERSPECTIVE ON RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS AND ADVANCES AND THE BRAZEN RESOLVE OF ENTREPRENEURS THAT HAVE MADE TO STATE GREAT. AND. REALLY THE MIDDLE GROUND FOR A. CONSTRUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE SOCIETY LIES IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN BOTH. SO I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ASKED TODAY TO OPINE ON THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN ALSO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS ON WHAT I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THIS. I WAS ASKED TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK A BIT AND GIVE A FEW DEFINITIONS ABOUT ONE A I MEAN SO BEAR WITH ME WHILE I DO THAT. I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE AS BASIC ON THIS. AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS CONFUSING THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE OUT THERE. BETWEEN. THE SKEPTICS. BETWEEN THOSE THAT. DEPICT AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MOVIES. THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE THAT'S VERY ENTERTAINING BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. CLEARLY DETERMINES OVERHYPED WHAT IT IS SENSUALLY ENTAILS IS AN ARRAY OF TECHNOLOGIES MAINLY COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES. THAT SIMULATE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY PERFORMED BY THE HUMAN BRAIN COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. SO AMONGST THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION LANGUAGE TRANSLATION IMAGE RECOGNITION. ABOUT ALSO THINGS AS BASIC AS ADVANCED STATISTICAL. METHODOLOGIES AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. SO WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT. STATISTICS AT SOME POINT COULD BECOME SO SEXY. RIGHT NOW SO IT IS DEFINITELY PART OF THE PICTURE. WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH HERE. THESE TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN WHAT'S CALLED A GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MOST OF THE PUBLIC ATTENTION HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY THE GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS OFTEN PREDICTED BY HOLLYWOOD AS SUPER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. THIS IS THE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE THAT ONLY HUMANS AND ANIMALS TO DATE POSSESS. TO VARYING DEGREES OF COURSE AND IT IS ABLE TO. LEARN. WASTES A CERTAIN DATA SETS HOW TO PERFORM CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AND THEN TAKE THAT LEARNING AND TRANSPOSE IT OVER INTO OTHER FUNCTIONS. IT IS ABLE TO LEARN FROM UP TO TO MEMORIZE PREVIEWS LEARNING AND THEN APPLY LESSONS FROM THE PAST TO FUTURE AND FORWARD LOOKING PROBLEMS AGAIN THAT IS. USUALLY. USUALLY THE HUMAN DOMAIN. A AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THAT GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MIGHT AT SOME POINT BE POSSIBLE. BUT THIS IS DECADES IN THE FUTURE SO EIGHT OUT OF TEN SCIENTISTS TELL ME THAT GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AT LEAST TWO TO THREE DECADES AWAY AND THAT'S USUALLY THE OPTIMISTIC SIDE OF THINGS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT IT HAS TAKEN US SEVENTY YEARS TO GET TO THE CURRENT POINT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF COURSE BREAKTHROUGHS IN LEAPS ARE POSSIBLE. NOW WE SHOULD KNOWLEDGE THAT. A NARROW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MOST OF THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WE SEE TODAY IT IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON VERY DISCREET FUNCTIONS. SO WHEN YOU SEE. IBM'S DEEP BLUE BEATING SOMEBODY A CHESS OR WHEN YOU SEE OF GOOGLE DEEP MIND ALPHA GO BEAT THE WORLD'S RATING GO CHAMPION THOSE OR OF CAR COURSE IMPRESSIVE FEATS. BUT THEY'RE VERY NARROW IN FUNCTION. IN OTHER WORDS. THE TASK FOR THE COMPUTER IS TO BEAT THEIR HUMAN CHESS CHAMPION. BUT. AS THE MACHINE THE I CANNOT TELL YOU WHY IT IS MOVING. A. CERTAIN OF FIGURE ON THE CHESS BOARD IN A CERTAIN WAY. OR WHY IT IS PROTECTING THE KING. IT CAN EQUALLY NOT TELL YOU WHICH GAME TO PLAY TO SOLVE A CERTAIN PROBLEM A CANNOT CHOOSE BETWEEN CHESS AND GO ANOTHER. OTHER GAMES SO IT IS VERY LIMITED IN ITS SCOPE AND IN THE TASK THAT IT IS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE. SO WITH THAT SAID THEN. SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU HEAR MENTIONED ARE. DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND MACHINE LEARNING THOSE ARE. REALLY IS A MOST RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY SOLVE COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. FOR US. FOR HADES BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAVE PHYSICAL INSTANTIATIONS. SO WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRIVING THINGS LIKE ROBOTS. AUTOMATION AND FACTORIES AUTONOMOUS FUNCTIONS IN VEHICLES AND DRONES. EVEN YOUR THERMOSTAT IN YOUR HOME. RIGHT SO I IN THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT IS WELL CONTAINED IN A BOX OR IN A NETWORK IT IS INCREASINGLY DEFINING OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. THAT HAS DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON OUR SOCIETY IF THE FIRST ONE IS OF COURSE ECONOMIC. YOU HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS CHAIRMAN CHAO. THE IMPACT ON TIED JOBS. YEAH. WE ARE ALREADY SEEING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AT FORCE IN ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS. WE ARE SEEING BASIC TASKS THAT SEEM VERY HUMAN FOR US PERFORMED BY MACHINES SUCH AS SECRETARIAL. SERVICES PERFORMED BY A ME. AND ELLIE AND OTHERS OF VIRTUAL SECRETARIES THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO PURE EMAIL DIALOGUE BETWEEN YOU AND THEM YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE COMPUTER FROM THE HUMAN. THERE ARE SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS HERE. THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE RELATE AND INTERACT. AND HOW WE COMMUNICATE TRUST FOR INSTANCE VERY IMPORTANT. AND THEN THEY ARE PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL ONES THAT. ENABLE THAT HAVE A I HAD CHANGED THE WAY IN IN WHICH WE LOOK UPON OURSELVES. AND IN WHICH WE CONCEIVE OF US AS OF OURSELVES AS. PERSONS OF HAVING PERSONHOOD. VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL. WHY SHOULD WE CARE? WHY SHOULD WE CARE? AS CITIZENS AS POLICY MAKERS. IN YOUR ROLE. A AYE CHANGES. THE WAY WE ACT OUT INTIMACY. SO. THE COMPUTER AND THE CORPORATION THAT OWNS THE COMPUTER HAS A MUCH MORE INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE ARE. AND WE ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE WE GET SOMETHING IN RETURN BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY ACCEPTED AT IN FULL CONSCIOUS CONSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS ASKED WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS FOR US. SO THE DEGREE OF INTIMACY BETWEEN US IN THE MACHINE IS CHANGING. WE ARE TODAY IN A HYPER CONNECTED WORLD. SO THIS DEGREE OF CHANGE IS SPREADING THROUGH NETWORKS AND THROUGH OUR SOCIETAL FABRIC VERY FAST. IF WE I HAD HAPPENED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME PHENOMENON SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CONNECTIVITY THE NETWORKS WERE IN THERE. OUR THIRD. A ICE CONNECTED WITH THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WANT ON MANY OF THESE INTERNET PLATFORMS WE GET SERVICES WE GET PRODUCTS WE GET RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE ERCEIVE AS ENRICHING OF OUR LIVES. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT IT COMES AT A COST. AND THEN LASTLY ALL OF THIS HAPPENS AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE. OUR MACHINES COMPUTERS ALGORITHMS TALK TO OTHER MACHINES AND DEVELOP CHO WOOD. BY THEMSELVES. THAT IS IN IT'S VERY EARLY STAGES NOT EVERY QUARTER IS GOING TO BE DISPLACED. BUT THERE IS A SPEED ELEMENT IN THIS THAT WE NEED TO RECKON WITH. SECONDLY I'LL A LOT OF. THESE NEW A AYE PLATFORMS. ARE OPEN SOURCE. SO WITH THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD CAN NOW DEVELOP THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS. PRETTY MUCH FREELY. S. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MILLIONS OF CODERS NOW TAKING TO THE SAY I APPLICATIONS. WITH WITH NO THINKING NO CONSIDERATION AS TO WHAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS OF THIS ARE. SO IT'S VERY FAST AND YEAH I'M GONNA QUOTE LARRY DOWNES LOFT DISRUPTION HERE THAT SAYS THAT. TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS CHANGES EXPONENTIALLY. BUT SOCIETY AND POLICY CHANGE INCREMENTALLY. SO SPEED IS REALLY OF THE ESSENCE HERE SPEED OF UNDERSTANDING AND SPEED OF A SHAPING. WHY DO I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY A A DISTINCT ROLE IN THIS A BECAUSE WE ARE ONE OF THE? HUBS OF INNOVATION AROUND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE BENEFIT FORM IT'S GROSS. BUT COMMENSURATE WITH THAT BENEFIT NEEDS TO BE A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. SECONDLY WE HAVE A LEGACY AND WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF. BEING HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ON THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION SIDE. BEING A GROWTH ENGINE FOR THE NATION AND INDEED FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD AND YET BEING VERY INNOVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY SO THERE'S REALLY NO REASON. FOR WHY WE SHOULD SHY AWAY FROM THIS CURRENT CHALLENGE. YEAH AND OF COURSE WE ARE THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO DATE SO WHAT WE DO SETS TRENDS. INTERNATIONALLY AND IT'S NOT JUST ECONOMICS IT'S ALSO CALIFORNIA CULTURE THAT. THAT CATCHES ON A GLOBALLY SO WE HAVE A SIGNALLING EFFECT. I WANT TO WRAP THIS INTO GLOBAL CONTEXT THOUGH AND THIS IN THIS VEIN. WE ARE. ALONGSIDE CHINA I THINK THE NUMBER ONE INNOVATION HOTSPOT FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THERE ARE OTHER. U. S. LOCATIONS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT BOSTON OF COURSE. PITTSBURGH SEATTLE. VERY IMPORTANT TYPES AS WELL INTERNATIONALLY THERE ARE OTHER HUBS ISRAEL. CANADA AND THE UK GERMANY RUSSIA. BUT CHINA IS REALLY THE BIG KID ON THE BLOCK WHITE MOD HIGHLIGHTING THIS I BY NO MEANS ONE TO FALL INTO THE PATTERN OF DESCRIBING CHINA AS AN ENEMY. BUT THEY ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN OUR VALUE SETS AND WE ARE SEEING THIS ACTED OUT AND LIVED OUT AS WE SPEAK. AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THOSE BETTER AND COME TO GRIPS WITH THEM. CHINA IS INVESTING VERY HEAVILY ON THE PUBLIC SIDE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHETHER THEY HAVE ALREADY. OUTSPEND US. THEY ARE SPENDING TO CREATE A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A AYE INDUSTRY BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THEY'RE DOING SO VERY OVERTLY AND FOSTERING A PUBLIC SECTOR A PRIVATE SECTOR. R. AND D. AND PRODUCT IS ASIAN. THEY ARE REQUIRING THAT STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND IN FACT IN PRIMARY SCHOOL ARE LEARNING HOW TO CODE IN HOW TO DEAL WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT NATIONWIDE THAT'S ACROSS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION CHINESE. AND. ARE AND THEY'RE ALSO SETTING UP INNOVATION HUBS. TO THE TUNES OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT A TIME REGIONALLY. IT IS HARD TO SAY HOW WE STACK UP BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SPENDING ON THE UNITED STATES ASIDE IS. CLASSIFIED. AND IT IS DEFENSE SPENDING. I SHOULD HOWEVER NOTE AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE THAT WE ARE DRAMATICALLYCUTTING BACK ON SCIENCE FUNDING ON A FEDERAL LEVEL. AND OUR SCIENCE REPRESENTATION. GLOBALLY AS WELL AT A MOMENT WHEN CHINA IS INCREASING BOTH. ON THE DEFENSE SIDE WE HAVE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SPENDING. ABOUT SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION. MOST OF WHICH. IS REAL A SPENT ON. ON. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR RELATED SMART COMPUTING AND. BIG DATA AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES. SO ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT I BELIEVE IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT ELSE IS IN THAT A DEFENSE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUBLIC. SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SPENDING THEIR ON THE. PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE WE ARE STILL AHEAD. WE HAVE. SOME OF THE LEADING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS INTERNET COMPANIES I DON'T REALLY NEED TO MENTION THEM GOOGLE FACEBOOK. OF MICROSOFT OR APPLE. AND OTHERS. BUT THE CHINESE ARE. CLOSING RANKS PRETTY QUICKLY BY DO ALI BABA TENSE AND. ARE CHINESE LEADERS AT THIS POINT BUT ARE BEING PROMOTED TO GO GLOBAL FAIRLY QUICKLY NOW AND WITH CHINA'S INVESTMENT AROUND THE WORLD AND INFRASTRUCTURE A LOT OF THE INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES WILL RIDE ON THE BACK. OF THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE. TECHNOLOGIES. CHINA HAS SOME OTHER ADVANTAGES SUCH AS VERY HEAVY MOBILE PENETRATION ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION MOBILE DATA USERS. THAT ARE FRANKLY. SOMEWHAT MORE PROFICIENT. AND. AND. MORE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ON THE MOBILE HANDSETS IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES WECHAT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT. AND THEY'RE VERY ACCEPTING OF THAT PENETRATION IN THEIR LIVES. LAST BUT NOT LEAST CHINESE RESEARCHERS HAVE RECENTLY OVERTAKING U. S. RESEARCHERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF. OF ARTICLES AND PAPERS PUBLISHED. SO. WE ARE DEALING WITH A FORMIDABLE. FORMIDABLE PARTNER AND COMPETITOR ON A GLOBAL SCALE. CHINA IS ALSO INVESTING CO INVESTING WITH US I SHOULD SAY YEAH I'M HERE AND I THINGS LIKE THE NEW DOMMEL ACADEMY AT STANDS FOR DISCOVERY ADVENTURE MOMENTUM IN OUTLOOK. ALI BABA I SPENDING FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON PARTNERSHIPS THAT. ENCOMPASS ALSO. A. S. U. S. YOU VARIOUS U. S.. INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS. THAT. THAT ALSO INCLUDE CALIFORNIANS TO XIN SUCH AS A UC BERKELEY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TALENT. SO THERE IS A THERE ARE A LOT OF ASPECTS IN THIS WHERE WE ARE TIED BY THE HIP AND TALENT IS ONE OF THEM. SO THE KEY QUESTIONS ARE WILL THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN GLOBALLY I DEVELOPMENT CONTINUE TO EMERGE FROM CALIFORNIA. WILL IT EMERGE FROM CHINA PRIMARILY OR WILL IT BE A PARTNERSHIP. I LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THREE LENSES THE FIRST ONE IS POWER THE SECOND THIS PURPOSE AND THE THIRD IS POSITION. I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH POSITION LAST. A BECAUSE POSITION IS REALLY STRATEGY AND POLICY AND THAT'S FOR THE LAST PANEL. POWERS MOSTLY ARTICULATED THROUGH ECONOMICS. AND THERE OF COURSE WE HAVE SEEN MANY STUDIES HOW. A AYE OR AND ROBOTICS AUTOMATION READ LARGE WILL REPLACE DISPLACED LABOR. WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT FIGURES OUT THERE RANGING FROM SIXTEEN PERCENT TO FORTY SIX PERCENT. I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MCKINSEY LATER ON IN THE DAY. WE HAD BERKELEY WHICH BELIEVES THAT THE PICTURE IS A BIT MORE DIFFERENTIATED WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS ON A TASK AND JOB SPECIFIC BASIS. A I WILL BE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT ALMOST EVERY JOB THE QUESTION IS WHAT PART OF A GIVEN JOB AT THE MOMENT WILL IT DISPLACE OR CHANGING HOW DISRUPTIVE WILL THAT BE. THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC. QUOTES HERE THAT SAY THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF REVENUE INCREASE FOR GLOBAL CORPORATIONS THAT'S. MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR OF REVENUE INCREASES IN TOTAL AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT WE MIGHT SEE AS MUCH AS A TEN PERCENT INCREASE IN FACT IN EMPLOYMENT. RIGHT SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF UPSIDE HERE THAT WE ALSO SHOULD NOT IGNORE. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LOOK AT THIS VERY DIFFERENTLY AROUND THE WORLD. JAPAN IS NOT AFRAID OF THIS BECAUSE JAPAN IS IN FACT A DYING NATION. THE. THE BIRTH RATETHAT DOES NOT SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY THEIR OUT OF WORKERS AND SO THEY WELL VERY MUCH WELCOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTS AND IN FACT VERY HUMANOID ROBOTS. GERMANY FOR INSTANCE IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING AT THIS IN A VERY INTEGRATED. WAY. OF. USING A AYE TO FACILITATE LABOR A VERY COLLABORATIVE STANCE WITH LABOR UNIONS. AND I THINK A BIT OF A ROLE MODEL FOR US IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO. BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE JOIN PRODUCTIVITY BETWEEN A AYE INCREASES THE PRODUCTIVITY AND HUMAN PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES IS EVEN HIGHER WHEN SEEN JOINTLY. SO THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE SPECTRUM GLOBALLY WE'RE ALSO SEEING VERY PROMISING INNOVATION AROUND THE WORLD IN SPACES WHERE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE. EXPECTED THEM SUCH AS. IT AS SUCH AS. NIGERIA INDONESIA OF RUSSIA. AND WE CAN DIVE INTO THAT SOME MORE IN CUBA NAY IF YOU LIKE. THERE ARE RISKS AND. CHANGES TO SOCIETY WE CAN'T IGNORE. AND. YOU KNOW I WANT TO JUST OUTLINED A FEW PRIVACY OF COURSE IS ONE OF THEM. WE HAVE LEADING IN OF INNOVATORS IN CALIFORNIA. SUCH AS WE BOUGHT FOR INSTANCE FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY. VERY SUCCESSFULLY USING. DIGITAL CBT. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TRANSFORMATION AS PART OF FACEBOOK FOR INSTANCE AND THEY'RE GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS. GUY TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR DATA. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THAT GOES FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS FIELD BUT I THINK THAT IS A. THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT SHOULD BE LIKE. I TRANSPARENCY. WHEN FACEBOOK TELLS US THAT FROM NOW ON THE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. TO ENHANCE OUR EXPERIENCE ON FACEBOOK WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN. I COULD ALWAYS HAVE MY FACE A TRACED A BECAUSE IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MY NAME. THIS INCREASED CAPABILITY WILL IT NOW BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND MY MOOD IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AROUND ME I DON'T KNOW AND I THINK WE SHOULD SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED FOR. AND TO SOME DEGREE WE NEED TO MAKE THE MORE EXPLAINABLE RIGHT WE HAVE A DARPA INVESTING HEAVILY IN. A I EXPLAINED ABILITY USING ONE TOP OF A AYE TO EXPLAIN ANOTHER TAPE TYPE OF A AYE. AND THAT'S HOW COMPLEX IT IS TODAY BECAUSE SOME OF THESE MODELS ARE GET REALLY REALLY. REALLY REALLY COMPLEX AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND. WE OF COURSE HAVE THE LAPD THE NYPD USING PREDICTIVE TO. ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING AND OTHER A AYE TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO. SECURE OR SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS AND FOR PREDICTIVE POLICING. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT IS BEING FOUGHT OUT IN COURT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ALGORITHMS CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHY YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IDENTIFIED AS PARTICULARLY. RISKY AND A COMMUNITIES FEEL STIGMATIZED. SO SO EXPLAINED ABILITY IS A A BIG PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO DEMAND MORE OF IT BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY DIFFERENTIATED. APPLICATION AREA BY APPLICATION AREA LEST WE WANT TO HAVE VERY GENERAL OVER ARCHING REGULATION SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN. UNION. DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE THAT WAS JUST. RELEASED AND IS COMING TO FRUITION THIS YEAR. WHICH AS INNOVATORS AROUND THE WORLD. VERY RETICENT TO INVEST IN EUROPE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SLAPPED WITH BILLION DOLLAR FINES SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE A BIT MORE NUANCED AND APPLICATION SPECIFIC. THEN THERE IS THE AREA OF AGENCY WHICH IS PERSONAL CHOICE. AM I BEING NARROWED IN MY CHOICE BECAUSE ALGORITHMS FIGURE OUT WHO I AM. AND THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT I AM ATTRACTED TO YOU AND THEY KEEP ME ON THAT TRAJECTORY ALWAYS SPEEDING ME MORE CONTENT MORE RELATIONSHIPS MORE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PLAYING INTO WHO I AM TODAY. Y. WAS YESTERDAY. OR WILL A AYE ENABLE ME TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS AND MY SET OF CHOICES IN WAYS THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY BEFORE THAT IS A VERY BIG QUESTION. THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. SO. SO THOSE ARE THE SOCIETAL ISSUES NOT TO MENTION SAFETY AND SECURITY OF COURSE WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT IN A AYE ABOUT. ACCIDENT PREVENTION ABOUT MORALLY DICEY SITUATIONS YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE TROLLEY PROBLEM. HOW DOES IT AUTONOMOUS AUTOMOBILE OR THE A AYE IN IT OR IN THE NETWORK THAT GOVERNS IT? DECIDE WHEN TO. HIT A DOG IN THE ROAD OR A TREE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND OF COURSE IDEALLY AUTOMAKERS WILL KEEP US OUT OF THAT SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH BUT THERE MAY BE OF MARGINAL SITUATIONS WHERE THAT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT. WE ALSO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO AUTHENTICITY AND VERACITY IN SOCIETY AND THAT IS BEING THREATENED AS WE ALL KNOW. EH THROUGH. THROUGH. MANIPULATIVE ACTORS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA WE'RE NOW SEEING THE EMERGENCE OF WHAT I WOULD CALL DEEP FAKE ACTORS. THAT ARE NOT REAL THAT ARE PRETENDING TO BE. TO BE IN DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEIZE. THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM FOR HOW WE TRANSACT IN HOW WE ENACT DIPLOMACY FOR INSTANCE. A SO THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT IMPACT OUR SOCIETAL FABRICTHAT IMPACT HOW WE LIVE TRUSTS. TRUST TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CURRENCY IN SOCIETY. AND TRUST WILL. DETERMINE WHETHER WE AS CALIFORNIA WILL THRIVE WHETHER WE WILL BE TORN APART. AND WE HAVE SEEN MUCH OF THIS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS A IN OUR SOCIETY. SO WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS OUR AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MACHINE. SILICATES THAT HE AYE FACILITATES OUR HUMAN FABRIC OUR TRUST OUR PROSPERITY BUT NOT JUSTPROSPERITY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ALSO IN TERMS OF HUMAN GROWTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE MACHINE NEEDS TO FACILITATE US A. I. NEEDS TO FACILITATE US IT SHOULDN'T WE SHOULDN'T SERVE A AYE RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS SHOULD ABOUT A BE ABOUT US CREATING A BETTER SOCIETY SOLVING SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS RATHER THAN BEING RUN BY THE MACHINES AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL. POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO ENGAGE IN A REAL PARTNERSHIP. A ICE HERE TO STAY. IT IS OVERHEATED THERE IS A BUBBLE. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DOT COM BUST. I THINK WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CONCLUDE IS THAT YES WE OVER HEATED THE BUBBLE BURST BUT THE INTERNET WAS HERE TO STAY. IT IS STILL HERE TO STAY. AND IT IS MORE PERVASIVE THAN EVER AND I BELIEVE A I WILL GO THROUGH A SIMILAR CYCLE. THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE POSITIVE CHANGE IS A VAST. IF WE SHAPE IT AND GET AHEAD OF IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH UPPER PHOTOGRAPH A WITHOUT THAT LIKE TO OPEN A FULL QUESTIONS. ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS. LET ME START OFF WITH MY QUESTION EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT BIG DATA ARE YOU KNOW JUST WONDERING WHAT KIND OF DATA IS BEING COLLECTED BY ALL THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND WHETHER WHATEVER THE APPLICATION MAY BE. SO ODD EASIER ONE COMMON THEME IS THERE ONCE ONE COMMENTS SORTED DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY BY THESE. DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WHATSOEVER. YET TO GO TO TO DESCRIBE IT BROADLY WHAT. WHAT'S MOST VALUABLE IS WHAT'S CALLED LIFE PATTERN DATA. SO DATA THAT. SPEAKS TO YOUR LIFE PATTERN TO YOUR PERSONALITY TWO YOUR MOVEMENT. THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR LIFE. UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S MOST VALUABLE TO YOU. AND. THAT IS OF COURSE THEN THE HIGHEST VALUE BECAUSE IF A COMPANY CONSERVE SERVICES INTO THAT NEEDS PICTURE. TAKING COMMAND. MONEY. HIGHER PRICES AND WE LIKE IT AND IT'S ENRICHES OUR LIVES. OUR LIVES SO LIFE PATTERN DATA IS REALLY THE MOVEMENT PATTERN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE. THE RELATIONSHIPS IS REALLY WHERE MOST OF THE. WITH MOST OF THE VALUE IS. ADDED ARE YOU ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING. YOU KNOW WHETHER THE FUNDING ARE IS BEING ALLOCATED TO DEFEND THEIR OTHERWISE SO DO YOU SEE WHAT DO YOU SEE THE TREND BEING ARE LET'S SAY FROM THAT SAVED FROM PREVIOUS. ON ADMINISTRATION TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY I MEAN DO YOU SEE OUT THAT DOT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF A AYE AND AS SUCH OR ASA RESULT THEN WE ALLOCATING MORE FUNDING INTO. INTO THIS AREA OR NOT AND THOUGHTFUL OF QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW IF SO OR REGARDLESS IN WHAT CATEGORIES ARE WELL WE BASICALLY. ARE USING THAT THE FUNDING FOR OUR AND. DOING IT APPROPRIATELY YEAH. VERY GOOD QUESTIONS SO I THINK WE SAW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BEING VERY ACTIVELY. CONCERNED WITH SETTING A A AN AGENDA AND ECONOMIC AND THE SOCIAL AGENDA. RECOGNIZING BOTH THE POTENTIAL AND THE RISKS. I THINK THIS WAS TOWARD THE END OF THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M UNAWARE AS TO THE SIZE OF THE FUNDING AT THE TIME. I THINK. JUDGING BY RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH AND PUBLICATIONS BY PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL CAUGHT CIOS AT THE. AT THE O. A STEEP BE THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY THAT DEPUTY CTO. WE RECENTLY MADE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY TO. R. AND D. IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME. WHETHER THIS IS PART OF THE SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SPEND AT THE DOD ON A AYE AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES OR WHETHER THIS IS SEPARATE. AT I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW THIS RECONCILES WITH THE. EXISTING OR THREATENED DE FUNDING OF SCIENCE AND THE FUTURE AND SF BUDGET. SO THOSE ARE THOSE ALL STILL BE QUESTION MARKS YEAH YEAH I'M SO YEAH IS THEIR EMPHASIS ON ANY PARTICULAR AREAS FOR EXAMPLE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES OR OTHERWISE. AS FAR AS CATEGORIES OF FUNDING THAT. NYSERDA CERTAINLY WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS SYSTEMS. AND RELATED COMMANDING CONTROL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. SO THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY SOME THE FAIRIES ACTIVITY THIS IS THIS IS UNDERSTANDING HOW DO WE RELATE TO. SMART MACHINES IN THE BATTLEFIELD. OR IN POLICING AND HOW DO WE MAKE WHAT THE MACHINE DECIDES THE HUMAN DECISION MAKER. AND. AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE BIG AREA. I THINK. BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACES IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE A I WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL. AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS ALSO BEING STUDIED. ACT ARE BY NO THE PLACES. AND ISRAEL IN PARTICULAR ALSO HAS SOME VERY EXCITING. NEW VENTURES IN THAT AREA. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW AREAS AMONGST OTHERS. A MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO YOU MENTIONED THE EXPLAINED ABILITY PROBLEM. AND THAT IS AN AREA THAT I THINK IS GOING TO. REPRESENTS ONE TO KEEP THE KEY PROBLEMS WITH THE INTEGRATION OF THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES INTO SOCIETY. SO WHEN WE HAVE AN ALGORITHM. AN ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION TO THE PROCESSING OF DATA AT LEAST WE CAN EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW WE GOT TO THE RESULT FROM THE INPUT BUT WHEN WE HAVE. A A NEURAL NETWORK THAT WERE TRAINING WITH MACHINE LEARNING WE REALLY CAN'T ARTICULATE THAT AND SO YOU CAN ANTICIPATE. A TIME A COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW WHERE WE GOT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE SETTING. LIFE INSURANCE RATES BASED ON LIFE EXPECTANCIES ARE CALCULATED FROM THESE BIG DATA SETS AND WE CAN'T ARTICULATE TO PEOPLE WHY. THIS PARTICULAR SET OF PEOPLE IS AT GREATER RISK THAN THIS SET OF PEOPLE I COULD BE. A OF A WIDE VARIETY A COMBINATION OF THINGS SO WHEREAS NOW. YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE LOOK YOUR SMOKER AND THAT'S WHY YOUR AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY IS LOWER THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE IT BUT THEY ACCEPTED WHEREAS WE GET INTO TO THE. THE EXPLAINED ABILITY PROBLEM SPACE WHERE I YOU KNOW WE REALLY CAN'T ARTICULATE THAT SO THE QUESTION IT'S OPEN AND QUESTION WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I SEE THAT AS A BIG HINDRANCE. IN THE UP OUR ABILITY TO USE A AYE IN WAYS THAT ARE PRODUCTIVE TO OUR SOCIETY NOW. I THINK IS THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A AND EMILY IMPORTANT QUESTION RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING A AYE BEING USED BY COURTS AND BY JUDGES. IN VARIOUS U. S. STATES. MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT. RECIDIVISM AND ABOUT BAIL DECISIONS. THAT ARE FRAUGHT WITH BIAS. AND IT'S NOT THAT THE MACHINE IS BIASED IT'S THE HUMAN THAT CREATED THE DATA. THAT GETS FED INTO THE MACHINE THAT IS BIASED AND I THINK THE WAY TO COUNTERACT THIS A IS TO. DO TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GOVERN THIS WE NEED TO SEE THROUGH IT WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT. SO IF IT IF THESE ARE A AYE APPLICATIONS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WE NEED TO DEMAND THAT. THE LOGIC BY WHICH OF THESE. ALGORITHMS MAKE THESE DECISIONS NEEDS TO BE MADE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SO THAT DEFENDING COUNSEL CAN ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO IT. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY ONE THING WE HAVE TO DO SECONDLY I THINK WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT. A VERY FINE. OR ALTERNATIVELY SCRUBBING A DATA SETS OF FROM BIAS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA THAT IS OUT THERE ALREADY. THROUGH THE INTERNET THAT WE ARE ALL USING AS IT IS FED INTO THE MACHINE ISN'T. THAT THAT BIAS INGRAINED IN THAT DATA SAID ISN'T EXACERBATED WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. SO THAT NEEDS TO BE SOME REQUIREMENT. OF DIAGNOSING AND SCANNING FOR AND THEN SCRUBBING FOR THAT BAS. THAT TO ME WOULD BE THE SECOND SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT'S IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. MY FEAR WOULD BE THAT THAT REQUIRES A AN INCREASED LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND HOW SCRUBBING THE DATA SAID. IN BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE DATA ON THE ALGORITHM I SHOULD LEAD TO A GREATER. A GREATER RELIABILITY OF THE OUT YOU KNOW TO GREATER TRUST IN THE OUTCOME. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO ARTICULATE. WITH ALGORITHMICS SOLUTION. YOU HAVE JUST PUT YOUR FINGER ON ONE OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS IN ALL OF THIS WHICH IS THAT WE JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE NO. BROUGHT ENOUGH OF A SKILL BASE AND A KNOWLEDGE BASE TO REALLY CRITIQUE MUCH LESS CHANGE MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE NOTE WHEN CHINA AS TEACHING. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS HOW DO YOU SAY I BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR PUBLIC TO BECOME MUCH SMARTER ON DATA SCIENCE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S GOING ON A TO MAKE USE OF IT IF YOU JUST EQUIPPED TEACHERS AND. AND TRAINERS AND COACHES TO TEACH US MORE BROADLY ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK. SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT COMPLEXITY IS OVERWHELMING AND MOST OF US DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS. TO SEE THROUGH ALL OF THAT BUT THAT CAN BE HELPED WITH EDUCATION MEASURED MEASURES WITH TRAINING. WITH DATA SCIENCE COMPONENTS ACROSS THE EDUCATIONAL SPECTRUM. IT'S FASCINATING THANK YOU KNOW. ARE MISGUIDED WHO HAD. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OUT WHAT IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT OF A AYE RESEARCHERS TO DATE IS THAT. BEING ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW I'LL. BE THE WORLD CHAMPION AND GO. IS BEING ABLE TO BLOSSOM POKE HER. WHAT YOU KNOW IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS I? YOU KNOW. THE CAPABILITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S THE OBVIOUS ONES WHICH IS AUTONOMOUS CARS RIGHT AND. I THINK WE WE WILL BE SEEING OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. AUTONOMOUS CAR IS NAVIGATING. NOT JUST ON HIGHWAYS BUT STARTING TO NAVIGATE IN INNER CITIES WHICH ARE IMMENSELY COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS. WHETHER THAT IS LEVEL FOR LEVEL FIVE AUTONOMY EXPERTS ARE FIGHTING OVER AT THIS POINT. SO BEING ABLE TO PUT YOUR KID INTO A CAR AND HAVING THE CAR DRIVE THE CHILD TO THE SCHOOL WITHOUT A DRIVER IN IT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE SEEN TO BE SAFE OVER THE NEXT I DON'T KNOW FIVE OR SIX YEARS. THAT'S A MAJOR SHIFT IN OUR IN OUR TRUST AS WELL IN TECHNOLOGIES. THERE ARE OTHER APPLICATIONS OUT THERE THAT ARE. OBVIOUSLY FASCINATING LIKE CANCER DIAGNOSTICS. ON YOU KNOW CERTAIN A AYE BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND TO TAKE IN. DECADES OF RESEARCH ON BREAST CANCER ARE AND THEN TAKE A BREAST CANCER PATIENTS DIAGNOSED LE OWE IT AT SITUATION IN THEIR OWN WORDS. MATCH IT UP. WITH EXISTING CANCER RESEARCH AND THEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DOCTOR. ABOUT AT THE BEST TREATMENT PACKS. AND DOING SO IN AN IDEAL EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WAY WITH THE PATIENT AS WELL COMMUNICATING THESE INSIGHTS TO THE PATIENTS. WE HAVE STARTED TO WORK ON THESE THINGS AND THEY'RE STARTING TO TAKE SHAPE. THERE ARE OTHER APPLICATIONS OUT THERE DARPA FOR INSTANCE IS WORKING ON. HOW TO MANAGE FOOD CRISES UNDERSTANDING WEATHER PATTERNS AND SUPPLY CHAIN? PATTERNS AND. SOIL CONDITIONS MARKET CONDITIONS. TO PREDICT WHERE AROUND THE WORLD WE MIGHT BE SEEING FOOD CRISIS AND THEN MITIGATING THOSE SO THAT WE DON'T SEE LARGE SCALE FAMINE. ARE THOSE ARE ALSO. AMAZING AND THEN THERE IS A AYE AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR INSTANCE HELPING THE UN IPCC SEE. UNDERSTAND WHICH OF ITS CLIMATE CHANGE MODELS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A WICKED PROBLEMS. WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW HOW HOW EXACTLY THINGS WORK AND TIPS. A I CAN HELP US WITH THOSE WITH THOSE THINGS THERE'S MANY MANY MORE. THAT I COULD DESCRIBE SUCH AS YOU KNOW ENABLING. LARGE A LE ILLITERATE POPULATIONS IN AFRICA AND INDIA TO ALL OF A SUDDEN PARTAKE IN COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC PROCESS SEES. THEY'RE BY DEVELOPING A POLITICAL VOICE RIGHT THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD ALL OVER THE PLANET. YOU HAVE A VOICE WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY OR WHEN YOU ARTICULATE. COMMERCIAL BUYING POWER. SO BRINGING THOSE ILLITERATE MASSES INTO THE COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC PROCESS IS VERY POWERFUL AND THAT'S HAPPENING. ARE ALREADY IN IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AND AFRICA CAN. THANK YOU AND THAT YOU HAD A A QUOTE SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT I TECHNOLOGY MOVES QUITE RAPIDLY BUT PUBLIC POLICY. AYE INCREMENTALLY AND I YOU KNOW WERE AND WITH WITH A AYE IN PARTICULAR I'M YOU KNOW WE COULD BE LOOKING AT. TRANSFORMATIONS THAT CUT ACROSS EVERY. POLICY AREA. IN AND IT'S PRETTY OPEN ENDED IN THE SENSE THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE. IN IT COULD MOVE ON VERY AS YOU SAY VERY FAST TIME SCALES SO WHEN WE'RE SORT OF DEALING WITH THE THE THINGS THAT WE TYPICALLY TALK ABOUT AROUND HERE HOW DO YOU THINK THAT OUGHT AT. AYE IMPACT THAT YOU KNOW THE DISPOSITION WE BRING TO BEAR AS POLICY MAKERS WHEN WE HAVE KIND OF THIS. UNKNOWN APPROACHING YES. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I SUPPOSE THAT CITY GETS ME INTO THE REALM OF OF OF SUGGESTIONS FOR POLICY OR APPROACHES FOR LEGISLATORS. LIKE YOURSELVES. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE WE NEED TO DO TWO THINGS THE FIRST ONE IS WE NEED TO STUDY THIS NOW SO IT WOULD HELP. TO HAVE SACRAMENTO. FACILITATE OR BE PART OF. WHEN MICHAELA THINK TANK BETWEEN CORPORATIONS ENTREPRENEURS UNIVERSITIES. AND THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE ALL THIS IS GOING WHERE WHERE DO WE THINK THE NEXT BREAKTHROUGH IS GOING TO COME ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING AREAS AND HOW SHOULD WE FACILITATE THOSE BREAKTHROUGHS WE DON'T WANT TO HALT ECONOMIC GROWTH. I'M A BUSINESS PERSON I WANT TO SEE ECONOMIC GROWTH. BUT UNDERSTANDING WHERE IT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO IF WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER SETS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. I THINK IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE AN EXERCISE. OF CHARTING THE KIND OF FUTURE WE WANT FOR CALIFORNIA. RIGHTS IF IF WE DON'T WANT TO BE OVERWHELMED OR. TAKEN BY SURPRISE WHY NOT CREATE A VISION FOR CALIFORNIA TWENTY THIRTY WHAT DO WE WANT OUR ECONOMY OUR SOCIETY LOOK LIKE. AND THEN BACK INTO IT IS WHAT WE CALL BACK CASTING WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. FOR THIS TO BE SHAPE POSITIVELY AND WE DO HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST ROLL OVER. AND THAT. A I WALK ALL OVER US WE CAN HARNESS THERE'S LOTS OF POTENTIAL IN THIS THAT WILL BE THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW THAT WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PROFESSOR AND A LITTLE. LATER TIME ON SO I WANNA THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IF YOU CAN JUST STAY AROUND A BIT LONGER TO WILL BRING UP AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT PANEL. THE NEXT PANEL WILL. SPEAK ON THE TOPIC OF AUTOMATION APPLICATIONS AND WORKFORCE IMPLICATIONS JOINING US. OUR IS A LANEY MENDONCA WHO IS THE CO CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD ALSO A SENIOR PARTNER EMERITUS AT MCKINSEY AND CHAIRMAN OF NEW AMERICA. ALSO JOINING US IS ROBERT ATKINSON PRESIDENT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION. WHO WILL BE JOINING US FROM SKYPE? AND FINALLY MISTER DOUG BLOCKED CHO WHO IS THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR AT THE TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN. SO WITH THAT DOWN AND WE GONNA GET. HOPEFULLY GET THEIR MACHINE TO WORK MKTO. S. RECONCILE. ANY HARRIS. YES BUT IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. A PLEASURE THANK YOU VERY WELL THEN I THOUGHT WHY DON'T WE START WITH DOWN ON MR INMAN DANKA. WHO IS THEIR CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD? ALSO SENIOR PARTNER EMERITUS AND MACKENZIE. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ADAMS WELCOME WELCOME HELLO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SHALL ON MEMBERS. I'M IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE. AS I YOU SAID I. COULDN'T. I AM A FORMER SENIOR PARTNER MACKENZIE BUT I'M NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH THE FARMER AND THE WORK THAT I'M WILL DESCRIBE BRIEFLY WAS NOT DONE ON MY WATCH ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S GREAT WORKS OF THE OPINIONS ARE JUST MY OWN NOT THEIRS. I'M WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE RESEARCH ON. MOST RECENT RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LABOR FORCE. AND THEN LEAVE YOU WITH THREE THOUGHTS ON THINGS THAT I WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO. SO LET ME START WITH THE SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH. MY TOP LINE ON IT IS STOP CALLING THIS THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE. IT'S NOT HELPFUL. SCARES PEOPLE AND IT ISN'T A BALANCED VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE WE REALLY NEED TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A THOUGHTFUL BICU ABOUT WHAT'S GOING AROUND. ON RATHER THAN RESORT TO HOLLYWOOD ERA VIEWS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. THE TCHNOLOGY IS A PROFESSOR GOT ROTH WERE DESCRIBING ACTUALLY PROMISE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY GREATER EFFICIENCY MORE SAFETY FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE. THEY DO APPROPRIATELY AS A RESEARCH SHOWS STROKE FEARS ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON JOB SKILLS AND WAGES. MANY HAVE LOOKED AT THESE MOST RECENTLY REALLY GOOD WORK AT OXFORD. AND OF STUDY THAT I MENTIONED FROM THE MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE. FIND THAT LARGE SHARES OF EMPLOYMENT IN BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED WORLD. TECHNICALLY BE AUTOMATED. HOWEVER IS HISTORY HAS SHOWN. THE ANXIETIES ABOUT WHAT MAYNARD KEYNES CALLED JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES CALLED A CENTURY AGO TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT. A TERM THAT I PREFER TO THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE WERE ACTUALLY QUITE OVERBLOWN A MORE APPROPRITE QUESTION HAS TO DO. WITH REEMPLOYMENT HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND WAYS THAT THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED BY THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE HAVE THE SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE THOSE JOBS. IN THE FUTURE MOST LIKELY AS IN THE PAST THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TECHNOLOGY IS LIKELY TO FUEL PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. INCOME GROWTH AND BOOST DEMANDS FOR LABOR. ADD TO THAT LOWER PRICES AND RISING QUALITY DEMANDS AND GOODS FOR SERVICES AND SERVICES ARE LIKELY TO RISE. MANY OF JOBS THAT WILL BE CREATED. COULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN IMAGINED IN THE PAST A CENTURY AGO WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT AUTOMOBILES WOULD LEAD TO A DRIVE THROUGH RESTAURANTS A ROADSIDE MORE TELLS. WILL MORE RECENTLY THAT THE INFORMATION AGE WOULD LEAD TO STADIUMS FULL OF PEOPLE WATCHING VIDEO GAMERS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER. THE WORK FROM THE MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE DID A VARIETY OF SCENARIOS AROUND WHAT HAPPENS TO JOBS UNDER THE. APPLICATION OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY DEPENDING ON THE SPEED AND PACE WITH WHICH IT PROCEEDS. THEIR MID POINT ESTIMATE WAS THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL WORK FORCE. WILL BE DISPLACED OR COULD BE DISPLACED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FROM FROM THE SETS OF TECHNOLOGIES. A FASTER PACE COULD CRACK TRIGGER GREATER DISPLACEMENT AND OBVIOUSLY A SLOWER PACE WOULD DO SLOWER DISPLACEMENT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS A RESULT OF INCREASES AND DEMANDS AND SERVICES AS I DESCRIBED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. THERE WILL BE JOB GROWTH IN AREAS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE AND NEW JOBS ARE AS LIKELY TO OUTPACE THE JOB LOSS. THE NEW JOBS WILL DIFFER MIGHTILY HOWEVER FROM THE JOBS THAT ARE LOST. PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE OUT PACED AND DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION THAT IS GONNA REQUIRE SUFFICIENT. TRANSITIONS AND COSTS ON WORKERS BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES. IN THE UNITED STATES DEPENDING ON THE PACE OF THAT AUTOMATION THEIR ESTIMATE WAS. THAT UP BETWEEN TEN AND. THIRTY PERCENT OF THE WORK FORCE THE UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO EITHER CHANGE OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY SPORTS SKILLS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT THIS WILL NOT RESULT IN MASSIVE JOB LOSSES BUT IT WILL CHANGE THE JOBS OF JUST ABOUT EVERYONE. SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO THINK ABOUT ARE WE GONNA HAVE ROBOTS IT OUR JOBS. BUT HOW DO WE FIND THE SETS OF SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO WORK ALONGSIDE ROBOTS TO ENSURE. THAT THEY HAVE HIGH QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES. THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I WOULD THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE EXPLORING THIS ISSUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR NUMBER ONE. DO NO HARM. MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE DOES ANY HARM. AND WE ARE IN FACT AS PROFESSOR ACROSS SAID IN AN INTELLECTUAL AND DATA ARMS RACE NOT JUST WITH OTHER STATES BUT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES HAS AN INEVITABLE RIGHT TO WIN THIS ARMS RACE. WE DO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES THAT ARE BEING INVENTED HERE. ARE APPLIED AND USED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH. BUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE DEPLOYING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES PLAYS BY PLAY BY RULES OF THE GAME. THAT MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AS PROFESSOR ACROSS SAID IMPORTANTLY ON THAT LIST ARE ISSUES AROUND ETHICS AND PRIVACY TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY THAT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEPLOYED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. NOT JUST THE PRIVATE GOOD. AREN'T AREN'T IMPORTANT PART OF EQUATION. THE SECOND AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT IMPLICATION. OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. ARE THE IMPACT THAT THEY WILL HAVE ON IN EQUALITY AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE DEPLOYED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD AND WILL BENEFIT THOSE WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THEM. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE GAINS GO PROBABLY NOT JUST NARROWLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE THE SETS OF SKILLS TO IT TO BENEFIT FROM THEM. CALIFORNIA'S LIKELY TO SEE THESE IMPACTS EARLY. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGIES BUT BECAUSE THE NATURE OF OUR WORK FORCE AND OUR POPULATION TO BEGIN WITH. ACCORDINGLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD ON THINKING ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUALITY AND MOBILITY AND ENSURING THAT WERE TRACKING THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE GOALS FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THAT ARE AT THE SAME. LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE AS WE HAVE GOALS FOR. CLIMATE. GOALS AND THAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST THE DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES BUT ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES WE CAN'T JUST WAKE UP TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW FIND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T PAID ATTENTION. AND THE THIRD AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT THIS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. IS THAT THE BIGGEST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE MANAGE THROUGH THIS TRANSITION. AND HOW WE DO IT AT THE PACE AND SCALE THAT'S NECESSARY. TO KEEP PACE WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THAT FROM MY VIEW THAT NEED TO BE ON THE AGENDA AND ARE IMPORTANT TO BE. THOUGHT OF NOT JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE FIRST ONE OF THOSE IS RETHINKING OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. THERE WILL BE LARGE DISPLACEMENTS FROM A NUMBER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. WHICH WILL REQUIRE THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME WHO ARE GOING TO NEED OME HELP WORKING THROUGH THAT TRANSITION. SO THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS LOOK LIKE THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THROUGH THOSE ARE ALL REAL. AND CONNECTED TO FINDING OPPORTUNITIES AGAIN. I DO THINK THINGS LIKE PORTABLE BENEFITS JUST AND FINDING OPPORTUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE A. CASH AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR THOSE TIME PERIODS ARE CAN BE IMPORTANT. PERSONALLY I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF YOU BI I AS A SILVER BULLET TO THE SOLUTIONS BUT THE QUESTION AROUND CASH TRANSFERS NEEDS TO BE PART EQUATION. AS WELL. SECONDLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. PASTE AND CHANGE OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO MEET THE PACE OF CHANGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN TECHNOLOGY. IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT YOU LEARN FROM ZERO TO TWENTY TWO. AND YOU AREN'T AFTER THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LIFE LONG LEARNING. WHERE YOU HAVE PERIODS OF TIME WHEN YOU WILL BE IN SCHOOL PERIODS OF TIME YOU WILL BE WORKING AND MOST LIKELY MANY PARENTS THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU WILL BE DOING BOTH? SO WE NEED THE SAME THINKING AND AGGRESSIVENESS THAT CALIFORNIA LED TO THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO THINK ABOUT. HOW WE MANAGE THROUGH A TRANSITION OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO DECADES? TWO A NECESSITY FOR LIFELONG LEARNING. THAT WILL INCLUDE INVESTING AND INNOVATIONS THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO EARN WHILE THEY LEARN NOT STEP OUT OF THE WORK FORCE FULLY TO. BE ABLE TO. REGAIN THOSE SKILLS SO THINGS LIKE ONLINE LEARNING BLENDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO. CONTINUE TO BE EMPLOYED IN AND SAT EMPLOYERS TO INVEST IN LEARNING WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART EQUATION AS WELL. SO IN SUMMARY I'M NOT SCARED OF THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE. MOST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OF TRANSITION OF ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE TRANSITIONING EVERY YEAR. THAT IS A BIG NUMBER TO HAPPEN EVERY YEAR BUT IT IS NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE NO JOBS IN A DECADE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE GET THE GAINS FROM THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT. AT ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND THAT WE HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIAN UNITED STATES MANAGED TO THE TRANSITIONS AS WE LOOK AS WE UP MOVE TO THIS NEXT ECONOMY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. MR AT. MISRAQ. YES. THANK YOU AYE SHALL REMEMBER. HERE WE LOOK AT. YES. OKAY. GO AHEAD. FIRST OF ALL LET ME. START BROUGH BY THING I AGREE WITH VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING THAT LIKE CALLING MY NAME IS ALSO SAID. LET ME START WITH SEVERAL QUOTES THAT I THINK FRAME THIS ISSUE QUITE WELL. FIRST IS QUOTE AUTUMN IS AUTOMATIC MACHINERY DRIVEN BY LIMITLESS POWER GOING TO LEAVE HONOR HERE'S A STATE OF CHRONIC AND INCREASING. UNEMPLOYMENT. SECONDLY WE MUST CONVINCE OUR ON THEM FULL EMPLOYMENT THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE XCELERATED. THE THIRD IS THE EFFECT OF AUTOMATION ON UNEMPLOYMENT AS BEEN WIDELY IT RESPONSIBLY EXAGGERATED. PRINCIPALLY BY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO SEEM ENGAGE IN A COMPETITION OF ALL OF THIS. ARE ALL THREE OF THOSE VOTES. ONE OF QUIRK WONDER GO ON THE FIRST WAS BY THE U. S. SECRETARY OF LABOR IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THE SECOND WAS FROM A LEADING A AYE SCIENTISTS AND STILL TODAY. SAYS THE SAME THINGS THAT HE SAID THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND THE THIRD WAS FROM A VERY GOOD BOOK CALLED THE AUTOMATION HANNEKE. FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. MY POINT OF. GIVING THOSE CLOSES POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOTHING NEW. HISTORICALLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN PERIODS OF NEW WAVES OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND YOUR LAST ECONOMY. THEY'D BEEN ACCOMPANIED OFTENTIMES BY WHAT YOU CALL TECHNO PANIC. PARTICULARLY AROUND LABOR MARKET IMPLICATIONS. WE SEE THE SAME THING GOING ON AGAIN TODAY. THERE ARE. PUNDITS AND AUTHORED LIKE MARTIN FORD THAT. AUTHORIZES THE ROBOTS WHO SAYS THAT. BY TWENTY IT IS SUCH A BY THE END OF THE CENTURY ADOBE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WORKING. ANOTHER A JOURNALIST KEVIN DRUM RATES IN MOTHER JONES THAT IN FORTY YEARS THERE SIMPLY WILL BE NO JOB LAST. IT IS THIS FEAR FRANKLY AS AS AS MONEY SAID THE THERE ARE YOUR APOCALYPTIC FEARS THAT ARE JUST HAVE NO BASIS IN GROUNDED IN EITHER HISTORICAL. EVIDENCE OR ECONOMIC REALITY. WE CAN REST ASSURED THAT IN TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF JOBS. WHAT WHAT I DO THINK WE HAVE A CHALLENGE ON IS THE ADJUSTMENT ISSUE POWER WORKERS GOING TO COPE WITH HAVING TO BE HAVING TO MOVE TO NEW KINDS OF JOBS? I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN LABOR MARKET DISLOCATION RIGHT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE LAST FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN QUITE GOOD. WE RECENTLY RELEASED A STUDY WHERE WE LOOKED AT. LABOR MARKET DESTRUCTION. HER EVERY DECADE IN THE US ECONOMY FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY TO THE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IN PRIOR DECADE LIKE IN THE AGE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES EARLY EIGHTEEN NINETIES. pOCCUPATIONAL CHURNING OF. JOBS JUST BEING DESTROYED BY NEW TECHNOLOGY. FARMING FOR EXAMPLE WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT THE OTHER ONES PEOPLE FORGET IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THE SIXTIES THERE WERE A LOT OF. JOBS THAT PEOPLE THAT IN OFFICE IS CALLED FILE CLERK. PETER CAME ALONG THEY WERE NO MORE JOBS. AS FILE CLERK. SO THEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IS NOT ANYTHING NEAR WHAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST IN THE PAST WE'VE DEALT WITH IT REASONABLY WELL. I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS TODAY THOUGH. IS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO COPE WITHIN AND INEVITABLE INCREASE IN THE RATE OF OCCUPATIONAL LABOR MARKET DESTRUCTION? IT'S LIKELY IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS IT BE TECHNOLOGIES GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER GET MORE WIDELY DIFFUSED IN THE MARKETPLACE. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE JOBS LOST BECAUSE OF PRODUCTIVITY. AND CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS. IMPACTED MORE THAN OTHERS. THERE'S A STUDY THAT WE'VE WE'VE DONE. FOR PAPER WE PRESENTED FOR THE G. SEVEN CONFERENCE IS COMING UP IN MONTREAL WHERE. WE LOOKED AT THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY ESTIMATES WHICH WE THINK ARE WAY TOO HIGH BUT THEY DID RIGHT OCCUPATIONS IN THE LAST BY RISK AND WE ALSO. LIKE YEAH I F. WE DID OUR OWN STUDY WHERE WE RANK OCCUPATIONS AT RISK. I BY THE WAY I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE STUDY THAT WE DID OF THE STUDY THAT THE OECD DID IN PARIS. AND THE MCKINSEY STUDY THAT LINE HE REFERRED YOU ALL CAME UP WITH PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME NUMBER. ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF JOBS. THAT RISK BEING LOST FROM TECHNOLOGY OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO. BUT WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WITH OUR STUDY IN LOOKING AT THE MACKENZIE HE SAID IF WE LOOK AT. WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND THE REST OF LOSING YOUR JOB IN THE FUTURE FROM TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE FOUND AGAIN AND EAGER. TO BE BIGGER CORRELATIONS. UP THERE IS NO CORRELATION ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN GENDER. SO MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ABOUT THE SAME DRESS. THERE IS A NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH AGE WHICH IS A GOOD THING ARE OLDER WORKERS WERE HANDED BE AN OCCUPATION THAT WERE LESS AT RISK OF AUTOMATION THAN YOUNGER WORKERS. OLDER WORKERS HAVE A HARDER TIME MAKING TRANSITIONS SO THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THING. WELL THERE IS NO REAL OF. IT A LITTLE BIT OF THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CORRELATION WITH RACE. SO I HISPANIC AND AFRICAN AMERICAN HANDED TO BE AN OCCUPATION THAT WERE HAD A HIGHER RISK OF AUTOMATION. UP BUT WHEN YOU CONTROL FOR WAGE AND IN AND EDUCATION LEVELS RATES. WENT AWAY THE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT WE FOUND IS THAT. THE RESCUED REALLY MUCH MORE ORIENTED TO LOW WAGE. LOWER SKILLED OCCUPATIONS. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WON'T BE IMPACTS IT ACROSS THE INCOME. AND OCCUPATIONAL SPECTRUM. BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE BIGGEST IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE AT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE LOWER PATIENTS ARE ON THE ONE SIDE THAT. IS GOOD. IN THE SENSE THAT IT WILL SHIFT THE ECONOMY MORE TOWARD MIDDLE WAGE JOBS. IT'S HARD TO PAY PEOPLE WELL IN LOW WAGE JOBS BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY THOUGHT HIGHER. BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND WITH LOWER SKILL LEVELS HAVE A HARDER TIME MAKING TRANSITIONS. SO LET ME SUGGEST WHAT THAT IMPLIES I THINK FOR. WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND FRANKLY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING? TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WORKERS TO MAKE THESE TRANSITIONS. WE REALLY STILL REPORTED I YEAH I HAVE TWO WEEKS AGO THAT LAID OUT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA. AND IT WAS ORIENTED AROUND TWO OR THREE DAY THINK ONE THE FIRST ONE WAS REALLY ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE BETTER SKILLS. BEFORE THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS. ONCE A WORKER LOSES THEIR JOB IT IS HARDER TO DO THINGS THAT THEY HAVE STRONGER CAPABILITIES COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS. IF YOU'VE HEARD ON THE GO AND MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WITHOUT WE BELIEVE IT'S GIVING WORKERS. GIVING STUDENTS I SHOULD SAY AND EVEN ADULT WORKERS STRONGER DIGITAL SKILLS. IT'S STRIKING TO US SO THAT I DON'T I JUST USES BECAUSE THE DATE IS THERE BUT I ALL STATES ARE SIMILAR TO THIS BUT IT'S STRIKING THAT IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. MORE A LARGER SHARE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKE POTTERY. IN HIGH SCHOOL. THEN TAKE COMPUTER SCIENCE. ISSUES THEN I THINK A PROBLEM. I THINK WE NEED MORE OF OUR CHILDREN MORE OF OUR STUDENTS TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE. EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKE GEOMETRY BUT ONLY EIGHT PERCENT TAKE STATISTICS. AGAIN I WOULD ARGUE THESE STATISTICS IS REALLY ONE OF THOSE CORE SKILLS OR KNOWLEDGE SAYS THAT WORKERS NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE OPERATING A MACHINE AND INDUSTRY FOUR POINT OH SMART MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT. OR WHETHER THEY'RE IN A HOSPITAL WORKING ON ON THAT TESTING MACHINES. THIS IS THE COURSE HILL YET WE DON'T TEACH IT IN HIGH SCHOOL. SO I THINK REACHED AS MONEY AGAIN LINDA RETHINKING. NOT JUST YOU CAN CALL BUT HIGHER EDUCATION HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IN. IMPARTING OR SKILLS. A SECOND IS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SECOND BIGGER DOING A BETTER JOB OF HELPING WORKERS WHEN THEY DO LOSE THEIR JOBS FROM TECHNOLOGY. OUT WELL EVERY STATE IN THE NATION HAVE THE REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW WORKERS TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO ALSO BE INVOLVED IN TRAINING. AFTER THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. MOST STATES AND I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA IS IN THIS CAMP. DON'T ACTIVELY WORKED TO ALLOW AND ENCOURAGE WORKERS WHO ARE LAID OFF. GET TRAINING. THE INCENTIVE FOR MOST STATES IS IT IS YEAH WORKERS BACK IN THE WORKFORCE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP YOU WHY COSTS DOWN. THEIR MENTION GOOD STUDIES AT A SHOW THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMISSION OTHER STATES ARE JUST SIMPLY SEND THE LETTER TO WORKERS WHEN THEY COLLECT WHEN THEY APPLY FOR YOU WHY. TO JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TRAINING. BOTHER COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THAT'S TRAINING INVOLVEMENT GOES UP BY FORTY PERCENT. SO I THINK THAT AN EASY SIX THIS THE BEST TIME FOR WORKERS TO BE INVOLVED IN TRAINING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB AND THEY HAVE TIME AND THEY HAVE SOME INCOME SUPPORT. ARE. THE ONE THING I WOULD SUGGEST IN. WE REALLY DO NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING ONLINE TOOLS. FOR WORKERS TO HELP THEM WITH THINGS LIKE SKILL ASSESSMENTS. FINDING TRAINING RESOURCES DOING JOB SEARCHES. I EVERY STATE HAS ESSENTIALLY OF WHAT'S CALLED AN ONLINE ONE STOP. PORTAL. I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CALIFORNIA'S BUT I'VE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF STATES AND THEIR FRANKLY NOT VERY GOOD. THEY DON'T PROVIDE AN EASY TO USE INTERFACES REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO USE THAT. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK TO LOOK AT OF OR TO HAVE YOUR DEPARTMENT OF LABOR LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF THE MORE IT MORE INTERESTING PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP MODEL DOING NOW AND IN PARTICULAR. A PROGRAM THAT. THE MARKLE FOUNDATION. REPORTING IN COLORADO WITH THE MICROSOFT. FOUNDATION AND LINK IN. WHERE THEY CREATED OF SYSTEM COMPLETELY STATE OF THE ART ONLINE PORTAL? WORKERS CAN GO ON THEIR THEY CAN DO ON ONLINE SKILLS ASSESSMENT. TELL THEM WHERE THEY'RE WE WHERE THEY'RE STRONG WHERE THEY NEED TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL HEALTH. THEY CAN SAY WHAT OCCUPATION THAT THAT END AND THEY CANNOT FIND AYE SIMILAR OCCUPATIONS WHERE THE SKILL AT EDITIONS AREN'T ALL THAT GREAT. THEY CAN FIND VERY EASILY ONLINE TRAIN A SIGNIFICANT FIND ONLINE TRAINING RESOURCES TO GET INVOLVED IN. TO ME EVERY STATE SHOULD HAVE THE ROBUST ONLINE EASY TO USE SYSTEM FOR WORKERS AND I THINK IT'S. SOMETHING WE CAN DO STATES IS LIKE TO DO THAT BUT FRANKLY WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT YET. OTHERS CLOSE BY SAYING ARE AGREEING WITH LENNY I THINK WE SHOULD ALL THE STATE OF. DEEP BREATHS AND CALM DOWN THE THESE TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS TAKE LONGER THAN WE THINK. IT'S GONNA HAPPEN I THINK WE WILL COPE WITH THAT WE WON'T HAVE HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT. WE WILL HAVE I WOULD ARGUE HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY AND WAGE GROWTH. BUT WE DO NEED A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM FOR HELPING WORKERS MAKE THAT LEADS TRANSITIONS THAT ARE COMING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISTER ATKINSON. NEXT LET'S THERE GO TO MR DOUG BLOCK UP POLITICAL DIRECTOR WITH TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TELL AND MEMBERS. S. BEEN STATE MY NAME IS DOUG BLOCKED I'M THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR WITH TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN WHICH COVERS A HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS FROM BAKERSFIELD UP TO THE OREGON BORDER. AND FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION I WANNA FOCUS ON OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE DRIVING TRUCKS. BUSES AND TRAINS. AND FIRST LET ME SAY HOW HAPPY I AM TO BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'M SPENDING ABOUT HALF OF MY TIME ON THESE ISSUES. THAT'S HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE OF IMPORTANCE TO THE TEAMSTERS ACTUALLY JUST CAME FROM. BARGAINING WITH UNITED PARCEL SERVICE AT. THE HILTON OFF OF ARDEN WAY. WE ARE IN BARGAINING WITH UPS IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. COVERS. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WORKERS. AND OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'VE BARGAIN ON AROUND IS THE INTRODUCTION USE OF TECHNOLOGY. WHETHER THINGS LIKE DASH CAMS OR AUTOMATED SPEED CONTROLS OR ROUTING SOFTWARE AND GPS ARE THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP. MAKE OUR MEMBERS MORE PRODUCTIVE OR SIMPLY TOOLS TO DISCIPLINE THEM. AND SOMETIMES THEY DESERVE TO BE DISCIPLINED SO EXACTLY HOW DOES THAT WORK WHEN YOU USE TECHNOLOGY. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. EVERYDAY I OUR MEMBERS DRIVING TRUCKS. OR ANY VEHICLES HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND IN A SPLIT SECOND ON WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO PROTECT. SOMEBODY ON THE ROAD THAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM OR PROTECT THE CARGO. AND THAT IS A DECISION THAT RIGHT NOW IS LEFT UP TO HUMANS AND NOT AN ALGORITHM SO I AGREE WITH THE ORIGINAL. SPEAKER THAT THESE ARE HEAVY QUESTIONS. NOW. AMAZON IS U. P. S.'S LARGEST CUSTOMER. AND AMAZON IS PATENTED A HIGHWAY NETWORK THAT CONTROL SELF DRIVING TRUCKS AND CARS. THEY'RE DEVELOPING AN APT TO MATCH THE DELIVERIES WITH SHIPMENTS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS THEIR TESTING DRONES THEIR AUTOMATING THEIR WAREHOUSES. UPS IS RIGHT THERE WITH AMAZON. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. I HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE WE WORKED WITH HIM LAST YEAR ON A BILL AB SIX SIX NINE. WHICH ALLOWED FOR. PERMITTING OF OF TESTING FOR DRIVERLESS TRUCK PLATOONS BY A MOUNTAIN VIEW BASED COMPANY CALLED PELOTON TECHNOLOGY. WHICH U. P. S. HAS INVESTED IN. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE WORKED WITH MISTER BERMAN AND AND WITH PALATINE SO THAT WHILE THESE TRUCKS ARE BEING TESTED THERE'S GOING TO BE A DRIVER WITH THE COMMERCIAL. DRIVER'S LICENSE IN EVERY TRUCK AND IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW PLATOON IS A CONVOY OF VEHICLES. WHERE YOU HAVE A DRIVER IN THE FIRST TRUCK WHO COULD? CONTROL ALL THE OTHER TRUCKS BEHIND. HIM OR HER WIRELESSLY. BUT WHILE PELOTON IS TESTING HERE. THESE THERE'S A DRIVER IN EVERY TRUCK AND IN FACT OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY. WE'RE REALLY SEEING THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD ACTUALLY AUGMENT JOBS INSTEAD OF AUTOMATE THEM. NOW AS I'VE TRAVELED FROM SILICON VALLEY TO SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO TO D. C.. I LIKE LENNY I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THIS ROBOT APOCALYPSE NOW FOUR MILLION TRANSPORTATION WORKERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS. AND. I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT THAT THE ONLY THING INEVITABLE ABOUT HERE ABOUT THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY. THE OUTCOMES ATTACH TO THAT ARE STILL UP IN THE AIR. WE CAN DECIDE IF. THIS TECHNOLOGY BENEFIT SOCIETY IF IT BENEFITS WORKERS OR IF IT JUST BENEFITS. COMPANIES AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. TO BE BLUNT. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE WORKERS. FOR EXAMPLE A DRIVERLESS TRUCKS THE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. IN ARE CONSULTED ON WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. ABOUT DRIVERLESS TRUCKS IN PARTICULAR AND AND. WHO ARE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE PROBLEMS AND WHETHER THE SOLUTION OF AUTOMATION IS GOING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE? AND I'M AFRAID RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES. THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. EFFICIENCY REASONS COST SAVING SAFER HIGHWAYS. FOR DRIVERLESS TRUCKS. BILL ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT IS A MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE TRUCK DRIVERS. IN A LOOMING CRISIS AROUND AND THAT'S TRUE FOR BUSES AS WELL. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY THESE JOBS ARE HARD TO FILL IN THE FIRST PLACE. BEFORE DEREGULATION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TRUCK DRIVING WAS A GOOD MIDDLE CLASS BLUE COLLAR JOB FOR SOMEBODY WITH VERY LITTLE EDUCATION. YOU KNOW I THAT MY DAD HAD A CB RADIO IN HIS PICK UP TRUCK THERE WERE SONGS ON THE RADIO ABOUT TRUCK DRIVERS IT WAS KIND OF A MYTH THE CALLED MIDDLE CLASS JOB. AND. AFTER DO YOU WE WERE THE LARGEST IN IN THE COUNTRY IN AFTER DEREGULATION WE SHRANK TO DRAMATICALLY. THE PHOENIX THAT ROSE OUT OF THE ASHES OF DEREGULATION WAS THIS BUSINESS MODEL OF HIRING PEOPLE AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD OF EMPLOYEES IN A TIE THIS BACK TO A AYE. AND AUTOMATION HERE. AND OUT OF COURSE THIS IS THE UBER AND LYFT BUSINESS MODEL SO IT IT'S NOTHING NEW TO US. BUT WHAT IT ENABLE THE TRUCKING COMPANIES TO DO WAS TO. SHIFT. ESSENTIALLY SHIFT ALL THE COSTS AND BURDENS ONTO THE BACKS OF THE WORKERS FOR OWNING AND OPERATING A TRUCK. AND AS A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER THE LAW AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR HAS NO RIGHT TO ORGANIZE A UNION. AND I I SHOULD SAY THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH TRUCK DRIVERS. AND. STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT IN TIME IT WENT FROM A A GOOD JOB TO ONE WHERE NOW THEY WORK SEVENTY EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK THAT NO SOCIAL SAFETY NET NO UNEMPLOYMENT NO WORKERS COMP. NO HEALTH INSURANCE NO BENEFITS NO RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE AROUND THOSE THINGS. AND. THEY MAKE LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT THEY CAN'T FIND PEOPLE TO TAKE THESE JOBS. AND I WOULD. SO HUMBLY SUGGEST THAT THE INDUSTRY IS NOW USING DRIVERLESS TRUCKS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT THEY THEMSELVES CREATED. ARE AROUND THE BY DESTROYING THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS. SO THE QUESTION TO ME IS WILL THIS TREND JUST FURTHER EXACERBATE THIS PROBLEM. AND I WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE ATLANTIC. MAGAZINE A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND ASKED TO RESPOND TO A REPORT BY UBER THAT PREDICTED AN ACTUAL NET INCREASE IN JOBS DO THE SELF DRIVING TRUCKS I BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY TO BE TRUE. A. IT I THINK IT'S MORE GOING TO BE. BECAUSE DRIVERLESS TRUCKS CANNOT OPERATE IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE. NEW JOBS THINK ABOUT THE AMAZON FLAX DRIVER DOING DELIVERIES OVER THE SHORT HAUL DRIVERS LIKE WE HAVE AT THE PORTS OF LA LONG BEACH IN OAKLAND. THE PROBLEM WITH THE REPORT. IN MY OPINION WAS THAT WAS TOTALLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE OF JOB QUALITY. FIRE WHETHER THESE JOBS CAN ARE THEY GONNA BE GOOD UNION JOBS THAT ARE CREATED ARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR JOBS. HOW WILL THAT IMPACT OUR UPS DRIVERS TO? WHO? ARE MAKING DECENT WAGES WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. WITH FULLY PAID FAMILY HEALTH CARE IN A PENSION. I'M ALSO SKEPTICAL ABOUT UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND I'M. HONESTLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT PORTABLE BENEFITS. I'M ALSO SKEPTICAL ABOUT RETRAINING. AND I LET ME TELL YOU WHY. WE HAVE A PLANT CLOSURE WE JUST GOT NOTICE TWO THOUSAND TEAMSTERS AT SENECA FOODS CANNERY IN MODESTO ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. THIS IS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK. AT OUR PEAK WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING IN CANNERIES MOSTLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WE'RE DOWN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND AS I SAID WE'RE GONNA LOSE TWO THOUSAND MARK. THE LAST PLANT CLOSURE WE HAD WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO CAMPBELL SOUP IN TWENTY TWELVE AND EIGHT HUNDRED TEAMSTERS LOST THEIR JOBS. THE GREAT ARTICLE ACTUALLY HORRIBLE ARTICLE IN THE SACK BE THE DAN MORAINE WROTE PROFILING ONE OF OUR MEMBERS WHOSE MOM HAD WORKED THERE HER WHOLE LIFE SHE FOLLOWED HER MOM THERE. IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON. SINGLE MOM WITH TWO KIDS LOST HER JOB. HER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RAN OUT SHE GOT RETRAINING. THROUGH THROUGH UNDER THE WARN ACT AND AND TRADE ADJUSTMENT. IT TOOK HER THREE YEARS TO LEARN TO BECOME AN ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN BY THAT TIME. SHE HAD LOST THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE GOT SICK MOVED HER FAMILY BACK IN WITH HER MOM. AND AT THE END OF HER RETRAINING THERE WAS NO. JOB GUARANTEE SHE WAS NOT MATCHED TO A JOB. IN THE SAME ARTICLE. MISTER MORAINE TALKED ABOUT THE OWNER OF THE CAMPBELL SOUP. COMPANY WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE SEVENTEENTH WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO FORBES WHO. IN THE PANAMA PAPERS IT CAME OUT HE MOVE TO IRELAND RENOUNCED HIS US CITIZENSHIP TO AVOID PAYING TAXES. SO VERY DRAMATIC EXAMPLE BUT. IT REINFORCES THE POINT TO ME THAT WE CANNOT TRUST THE COMPANIES. CORD DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO WRITE THE RULES CANNOT TRUSTS THEM TO DO THAT FOR THE WORKERS AND FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND. WE NEED YOU. TO WRITE THE RULES. THE TEAMSTERS ARE NOT AGAINST INNOVATION. MORE NOT GONNA STOP. THE THE REVOLUTION THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP IT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROTECT ALL THE JOBS BUT WE'RE GONNA DO OUR VERY BEST TO PROTECT THE WORKERS. AND WE NEED YOU TO GET COMMITMENTS FROM THE COMPANIES TO RETAIN AND RETRAIN INCUMBENT WORKERS. TO TO WORK WITH US AND WITH EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SKILLS ARE THAT PEOPLE NEED NOW HOW DO YOU MATCH THEM UP. AND THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE QUALITY JOBS THE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. TO ME THAT'S REAL INNOVATION. THAT'S TECHNOLOGY THAT'LL MAKE PEOPLE'S JOBS SAY FOR THAT MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE SO THAT THEY CAN EARN MORE MONEY. IT SHOULD REDUCE THE GAP BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS. THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS WE SHOULD BE SOLVING FOR WITH TECHNOLOGY INTO THAT AND I WILL CLOSE ON THIS I AGREE WITH ONE OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE WELL SERVED BY A COMMISSION THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES AROUND TECHNOLOGY AUTOMATION IN THE FUTURE OF WORK THAT INVOLVES INDUSTRY. LABOR AND WORKERS WERE LEFT OFF THAT EARLIER LIST AND I THINK WE ARE AN IMPORTANT VOICE. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION TO PUSH THIS IDEA. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION JAM AND. WITHOUT DOUBT QUESTIONS OF MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. I THINK THAT YOUR QUESTION FOR MR MENDONCA AND. I I WAS FASCINATED BY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND PARTICULARLY THE. ASSERTION THAT WHEN WE SAY. OUR UNEMPLOYMENT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT DISPLACEMENT WE'RE TALKING NOT TALK ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO RETRAIN PEOPLE INTO NEW JOBS BECAUSE. THE USUALLY THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY CAN CATALYZE THE CREATION OF MORE NEW JOBS OF THE JOBS IT DISPLACES BUT IT CREATE CREASES BIG SOCIETAL PROBLEM. A LOT OF THE OTHER PANELISTS AT SIMILAR THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT BUT I WONDER FOR BEING A LITTLE BIT NAIVE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT LOGICALLY. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO RETRAIN PEOPLE AND AND HOW TO GET THEM TO TRANSITION INTO FROM AS YOUR LOCAL JOBS INTO THE NEW FIELDS. YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT HISTORY OF. WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE I MEAN IN THE WHAT THE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN? WHEN WE HAD THE LUDDITES BURNING THE TEXTILE MILLS IN ENGLAND. IT IT THAT WAS REALLY WHAT CATALYZED THE BIGGEST EXPANSION IN OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IN HUMAN HISTORY UP UNTIL THAT POINT. AND YET I DON'T THINK THAT IF WE WENT DOWN TO THE TO THAT MOB WITH THE TORCHES AND SAID HEY WAIT WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU NEW JOBS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD DO ANY GOOD SO. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE ALMOST LOOK AT IT FROM AN OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE FEAR THE ROBOTS WE FEAR OUR REACTION TO. THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I WONDER WHAT WE CAN DO TO TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THIS COMING TRANSITION BECAUSE TO ME THAT'S KEY TO AVOIDING THE THE APOCALYPTIC PART OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND SO. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TIMES IN RECENT HISTORY WHERE WE HAD THE SCALE OF CHANGE. A MOVEMENT FROM THE AGRICULTURAL. EMPLOYMENT TO. THAT MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT FOR MANUFACTURING TO TO. SERVICE WERE ENTERING THE THIRD YEAR OF THAT A TRANSITION TO A TECHNOLOGY BASED ERA IN EACH OF THOSE PRIOR IS THAT WAS PUSHED BACK FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. BUT THERE WAS ALSO A MASSIVE INNOVATION AND HOW WE ENABLED PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM SO IN THE FIRST ONE WE INVENTED IN UNIVERSAL HIGH SCHOOL. THE SECOND ONE WE MOVED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY THE GI BILL AND TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THINGS LIKE THE MASTER PLAN TO CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAD THE SIDE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT NEXT MONTH WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT SAME SCALE OF THINKING HERE. BECAUSE IT'S IT IS THERE IT IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES I AGREE WITH THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. HOW OUR PACE AND SCALE OF ENSURING THAT? THE WORK FORCE IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE GAINES MATCHES THE PACE OF CHANGE OF OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT'S WHERE I'M BY I THINK THAT CONVERSATION REALLY NEEDS TO BE ABOUT THAT PART OF IT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. I DO THINK THERE WILL BE NEW JOBS THERE AND I SHARE THE VIEW THAT A LOT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF JOBS. SO THERE MAY BE MORE JOBS AND TRANSPORTATION IS THE RESULT OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES THEY'LL BE VERY DIFFERENT JOBS. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY PARTICIPATED NOTS. THANKS I AGREE WITH YOU I JUST WONDER IF THAT BATTLE STARTS DOESN'T START NOW NOT WIN THE PEOPLE'S PEOPLE DISPLACED BUT YOU KNOW THAT BATTLE STARTING NOW WITH AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS THAT SAYING LOOK THIS CHANGES COMING. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IT COMPLETELY GREAT. THANK YOU. BOB THANK YOU ARE ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION I THINK. ON COMPUTER SCIENCE PARTICULARLY I THINK THE EXAMPLE WAS THAT WAS GIVEN WAS. POTTERY VOICES COMPUTER SCIENCE SO IT'S A QUESTION AYE I THINK WAS EITHER AT MISTER ATKINSON OR. LENNY UP BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MOTIVATE YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE TOO. ARE MAKING MANY STANDARD COMPUTER SCIENCES YOU KNOW THE ESSENCE OR THAT DENTAL THAT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING BLOCK FOR THE FUTURE JOBS AND AND ALL. ON SUSU YOU KNOW WE WE DO WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW GET INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT BUT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE. WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MOTIVATE YOUNG PEOPLE? ARE YOU THERE. WELFARE. YEAH I I I DIVERT ALL. THE REASON WHY POTTERY IS SO POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL DID THE REQUIREMENTS. PARTS PARTS IS A REQUIREMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY IT ALL THAT MUCH OF A QUESTION THE MOTIVATION I I THINK THERE. LOTS AND LOTS OF KIDS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN TECHNOLOGY YOU LOOK AT IT AND YOU LOOK AT ADDITION LIKE FIRST ROBOTICS. ABACHA. A FANTASTIC PROGRAM I I'M SURE EVERY. SCHOOL ARE I'M SURE THERE IS A SCHOOL IN EACH ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS WHERE YOU HAVE FOR ROBOTICS COMPETITION GOING ON A. JOIN IN. REGION ALL THE NATIONAL COMPETITIONS AND EVEN HER NATIONAL THAT YOU CAN BUILD THE BEST ROBOTICS IT WOULDN'T WHEN YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL. IF YOU MEAN IF I THINK IF YOU RESTRUCTURECURRICULUM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY KID YEAH IN EVERY HIGH SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA HAS. HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCI FI THING AND CLASSES WHICH IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW BEEN IN EVERY COUNTRY IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. AND SECONDLY TO REACH RESTRUCTURE CURRICULUM SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE PROJECT BASED LEARNING AROUND THESE THINGS. WHEN WE LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S WRITING BASED LEARNING THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE OUT. THE MAKER MOVED ANOTHER WOULD HAVE A CERTAIN SORT OF IF YOU WILL TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SHOP CLASS IN WHAT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. IT ALL THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS PILOTING WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO DO THAT IN THE ENGAGEMENT WITH HIS IS JUST ENORMOUS THEY COULD ACTUALLY. USE COMPUTERS. DESIGN THINGS THEY USE COMPUTER A SPECIES THAT BUILD THINGS. I'M NOT SURE QUESTION MOTIVATION I THINK IT IN SOME WAY TO THE QUESTION OF IF YOU. LEAVE THE HORSE TO WATER HERE THEY WILL BRING. S. FARMING I HAD YEAH JUST ONE. MAKE IT QUICK OF WHAT COMMENTS APOLOGIES FOR MISSING MOST OF THE THE COMMENTS ADDED TEN CONSTITUENT GROUPS BACK MY OFFICE. BUT I'D. PIGGY BACKING OFF OF. MISTER ATKINSON'S COMMENTS. I KNOW THAT STATISTICS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TODAY'S THE MY CAMPAIGN A LOT AND I HAVEN'T CHECKED THE UPDATED ONES BUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAD ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE. IT WAS TYPICALLY THE HEAVILY. LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE SCHOOLS DIDN'T OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SO WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR W. TO BRIDGE THAT. KIND DIGITAL LEARNING DIVIDE THAT EXISTS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MISTER ATKINSON MENTION MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT. I I THINK HE MEANS PART OF A THROUGH G. CURRICULUM. WHICH ARE THE OFF THE WALL IT CAN BE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS OR COULD BE THE IF YOU'RE G. CURRICULUM WHICH OF THE. REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR THE USE YOUR SEATS YOU SYSTEMS. NON AND THERE'S CURRENTLY I KNOW A STATE COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND I'M SURE I DIDN'T GET THE NAME RIGHT. BUT THAT'S LOOKING AT IDEAS FOR HOW WE CAN BETTER. YEAH IMPLEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE INTO OUR CLASSROOMS HOPEFULLY K. THROUGH TWELVE ON YOU KNOW YOU HEAVY COATING IN SECOND GRADE BUT YOU CAN. BE CERTAIN I LEARNED SOME OF THE CONCEPTS AND SO. I'M LOOKING FOR TO SEE WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FROM THAT COMMITTEE. AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM. OUT SO. ONE IS I THINK MISTER BLOCK. FOR THE WORK THAT WE DID TOGETHER LAST YEAR THAT I KNOW YOU MENTIONED WELL WHEN I WAS IN HERE. ON AB WAS A SIX SIX NINE SIX SIX NINE. AND YOU KNOW REALLY APPRECIATED IT WE DESPERATELY AND I ONE THING THE CHAIR FOR FOR BRING ALL OF US TOGETHER BECAUSE WE DESPERATELY NEED TO BRING TOGETHER. OUR TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN OUR INNOVATION ECONOMY WITH LABOR AND I THINK WITH ACADEMIA. TO REALLY HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS. USING. REALISTIC. KIND OF. DE EXPECTED IMPACTS. SOME OF OF THE IMPACT OF OF INNOVATION IN A AYE ON THE WORK FORCE. AND DOES MISTER WHEELER OBERNOLTE IF IT WAS IT WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU GET OUT IN FRONT. OF THIS WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. LET'S IDENTIFY WHAT THEY ARE IN THIS DEVELOP THE POLICIES NOW. TO START. PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROGRAMS SO THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENS WERE READY FOR IT AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY TRANSITION FOLKS. EVEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS. INTO THE THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A GREAT FOR START. ON THAT AND AND REALLY APPRECIATE IT I WAS TALKING WITH. AN EXPERT AT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN MY DISTRICT. AND YEAH AND THEY HAVE A TON OF IDEAS AND THEY HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME. AND I THINK THAT ACADEMIA WHETHER IT'S. WHATEVER YOU INSTITUTION CAN BE REALLY GOOD NEUTRAL NAM KIND OF ARBITERS FOR SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. TO BRING FOLKS TOGETHER AND AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT POLICIES WE CAN IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO. I KNOW I THEM EAGER TO BE A PART OF THAT. AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALL SIDES OF THIS CONVERSATION I HOPE OR AND AND THINK ARE YOUR THAT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT CONVERSATION AND. THE SOONER THE BETTER. MISTER MENDONCA MENTIONED THE. NINETEEN SIXTY MASTER PLAN. FRAT HIGHER EDUCATION AND I WAS SELECT COMMITTEE. TO RICK TO REVIEW THAT. EVENTUALLY TO REVISE THAT NOTHING THIS NEEDS TO BE A BIG PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA RUN OUT. BUT JUST REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT BACK TO SAY THANK YOU. TO EVERYBODY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING MORE MORE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DO HERE. COMMENTS AND IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THIS PANEL I WANT TO THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR YOUR FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES NOW. AND IT WILL BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH GENTLEMEN. IF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER ATKINSON. THANK YOU MY PLEASURE AND I LOOKED LIKE TO BE THERE. THANK YOU AGAIN AT THIS TIME I'M TO BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL. OUR NEXT PANEL. WILL DISCUSS THE TOPIC OF GOVERNMENT SOCIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THOSE APPLICATIONS MIGHT MEAN TENS OF SOCIAL BENEFITS AND CONVENIENCE FOR USERS. AS WELL AS UP BIAS AND PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS. I JOINING US FOR THE PANEL WE HAVE SEVERAL SPEAKERS SUFFERS VOTE FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE MISTER PETER LIEBERT. WHO IS THE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY? WE ALSO HAVE MISTER OF LIKE RUM A YEAR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POWER. PUBLIC POLICY AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION OPPOSE MAKES. OUR MISTER PAUL DUGAN. MD AND PHD FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF MIND STRONG. ARE MAPPED HAGEL TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEYS ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND A MISTER JONATHAN FELT MEN OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. ARE GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WELCOME I'M SAY WITHOUT DOW WHENEVER YOU ARE READY WE CAN START WITH MR APPEAL LEVER. GOOD MORNING IT'S A AN HONOR TO BE HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF MEMBERS. I THINK OUR OUR PANELISTS HERE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD GROUP WIDE RANGING. SO I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY. TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT AN AREA I THINK OF THE HASN'T TOUCHED ON YET. BY THE WAY THE IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC SO FAR I'VE BEEN REALLY EXCITED SNOWING HERE TOPICS OF. THAT IS SPECIFICALLY A ON CYBERSECURITY. SOL START OFF WITH A WITH A STORY AND. TWENTY SIXTEEN I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE CALL DEF CON. AND. IT DURING THAT CONFERENCE THEY HAD SOMETHING CALLED THE CYBER CHALLENGE. DARPA PUT TOGETHER ACTUALLY WAS A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR PRICE. THEY HAD MULTIPLE ACADEMIC AND RESEARCHER TEAMS. A COMPETE IN A IN THE CHALLENGE A ACTUALLY A BERKELEY AND CENTER BARBARA BURKE BOTH IN THE FINALS. AND THAT THE PREMISE WAS SIMPLE AND DEVELOP A AT COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS. A COMPUTER A SYSTEM THAT PLAYS. BASICALLY A VIRTUAL VERSION OF CAPTURE THE FLAG. WELL HOW DOES THAT WORK WELL EACH OF THE. MACHINES HAVE. ACIDIC HE'S WITHIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE OTHER MACHINES HAVE TO ATTACK THAT MACHINE AND TRY TO. GRAB THOSE KEYS AND TO PROTECT OUR THERE'S THIS PROTECT IS ACTUALLY A OF NEVER BEFORE SEEN PIECE OF CODE. WHICH THERE HAVE TO IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES PATCH. AND THEN ATTACK USING THE PREVIOUS. IDENTIFIED VULNERABILITIES AGAINST OTHERS AGAIN COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS NO NO INDIVIDUAL IN THE LOOP. IT WAS A PRETTY FAST AND WATCH WHAT THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMS. ONE IT WAS CARNEGIE MELLON. BUT. IT PROVED A POINT THAT. YOUR AYE POWERED CYBERSECURITY. ON BOTH ON THE OFFENSE AND DEFENSE ASSISTANT DEFENSE OF SIDE. IS HERE AYE IT IS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS A A FANTASY. AND I THINK. YOU CAN SEE THAT ARE IN THE MARKETPLACE. FROM A. UNPACKING WHAT THE STORY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFENSIVE SIDE. THERE ARE. YOU NAME THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES OUT THERE DOZENS AND DOZENS THAT TALENT. A AYE CAPABILITIES. IMUS IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE. DEFENDING NETWORKS IS A VERY COMPLEX VERY DIFFICULT THERE'S A LOT OF DATA TO CHEW THROUGH. A TO TRY IDENTIFY MALICIOUS AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY A AYE IS A HUGE HELP IN THAT. I WAS ABLE TO FIND THOSE NEEDLES IN THE HAYSTACK AND AUTOMATE MANY CASES. INITIAL SCRIPTED RESPONSES TO UPLOAD HOLES IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ACTUALLY UTILIZE SIM A I AM THE STATE ALREADY. SOME OF THE. TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT WE BUILT WITHIN OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER RECEIVED A. USES MACHINE LEARNING. p AND THAT HELPS OUR ANALYST AT BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE WRITTEN THEY DO. IT IS A. CONTINUALLY EVOLVING. SKILL SET OUT IS SOMETHING HAS TO BE TUNED. COSTLY MONITORED. BUT IT DEFTLY HAS HELPED. NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. ON COULD THE BAD NEWS FRONT. JUST AS YOU HAVE A AYE DEFENSES YOU'RE LOOKING AT A AYE OFFENSE AS WELL. IS YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF. SCRIPTING ENGINES OUT THERE THAT YOU DO AUTOMATIC ATTACKS WOULD BLOCK ALLOTMENT BICU HAS ALREADY. THEY'RE JUST HUNTING FOR A PREVIOUSLY KNOWN VULNERABILITIES. AND WANTS TO GET A FOOTHOLD THAT CAN ACTUALLY LAUNCH A PLUMERI. TAX. TO ESTABLISH A FOOTHOLD AND THEN ALLOW HUMAN IN LIEU. THAT WILL GET BETTER OVER TIME. ATTACKERS WILL BECOME A JUSTICE DEFENDERS ARE MORE MORE RELIANT ON A AYE WHICH MEANS THAT. SADLY YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT FASTER CHEAPER. AND MORE TAILORED TO TAX. ALSO OF MORE HARDER TO ATTRIBUTE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE FOR ATTRIBUTION TODAY CURRENTLY. WITH CYBER ATTACKS IS OUR THE FLAWS THAT YOU WOULD SEE FROM HUMAN ERROR IN CODING I'M. FOLKS THAT DEVELOPMENT WHERE A LOT TIMES THEY'VE WE'VE LITTLE CLONE CARDS THAT EVEN KNOWING IT. THAT GOES AWAY ONCE YOU START LOOKING AT A AYE. BUILT. MALWARE AND OUR PLATFORM ENGINES. YOU KNOW EH IF YOU'RE TO USE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OF WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US FOR A COMMON EVERYDAY USER. SPAM EMAIL FISHING EMAIL RIGHT NOW EYES BECOMING MORE MORE TAILORED. THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVE GOING FOR US IS REALLY TO GET A VERY GOOD COOK WELL CRAFTED SPEAR PHISHING EMAIL COMING YOUR WAY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE SIT DOWN AND REALLY ANALYZE THE TARGET. USE OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE AS THEY GO TO SOCIAL MEDIA. THE SEEGER TRYING TO TARGET. MANY STARCRAFT IN IT THAT. IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL THINK IT'S TRUSTED AND CLICK IT. ARMS SPEARFISHING OR TARGETED FISHING OR WILL FISHING IS ALSO KNOWN AS A. WHEN YOU PUT A AYE ENGINE BEHIND THAT. AND BEGIN INPUTTING DATA SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM HOME YOU KNOW AT PUBLIC APPEARANCES ETCETERA. AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A AYE IN THEORY BE ABLE TO CRAFT. SPEAR PHISHING EMAILS UP TO HAVE A MUCH WIDER. USER DATABASE IF YOU WELL OTHER PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AND THAT HIS GOING TO BE. SOMETHING EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC. WE ALREADY ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING SPEAR PHISHING EMAILS WE IS IN THE ROLE WE. AND IN GENERAL. AND. IT'S GOING IT HARDER AS AS EASY TO ATTACK SAID BECOME MORE MORE PROFICIENT IN A HIGH BACKED. SO. SOMETHING TO HAVE GUESTS LOOK FORWARD TO. IN THE FUTURE. IT IS. IT'S IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A RACE BETWEEN. ENSURING THAT YOU REALIZE IN BOTH A THE BEST POSSIBLE PRE TO TECHNOLOGY. ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE WHICH A LOT OF IT IS A I ENABLED AYE HAS MACHINE LEARNING BEHIND IT. IN ORDER COUNTY THERE'S THREATS SO. THAT'S A TALL HAD. GRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER ONLY BURKE. NEXT LET'S GO TO MISTER AREA HERE. THERE'S A CORRECTLY YOU DID YOU ALL FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME. I I GOT IT. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE HONORABLE VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE. CLAIMS VICTIM IRE IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY PROPOSED MAKES. I DON'T I JUST START SINCE WORD OF THE ONE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE HERE ABOUT HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY APPLYING A AYE WITHIN OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND TALK ABOUT SOME THE LESSONS LEARNED FAIR. PARTICULARLY GERMANE TO SOME THE CONCERNS OF WHEAT FOR US. POST MATES IS A IT'S AN APT ENABLED START UP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET. ALMOST ANYTHING YOUR COMMUNITY DELIVERED TO YOUR DOORSTEP WITHIN AN HOUR. IT PAIRS YOU WITH A LOCAL MERCHANT. IF YOU WANTED A FOOD DELIVERED TO YOU IF YOU'RE A SENIOR CITIZEN WITH MOBILITY ISSUES IN NEED OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS. AT THEN PAIRS THAT MERGE INTO A LOCAL CAREER WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE NETWORK OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CAREERS IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT ON THE PLATFORM I'M AND THEN DROPPED THAT OFF AT YOUR HOME. SO FOR US ARE TESTING OF A I ACTUALLY COMES IN THE FORM OF ROBOTICS AND IT STARTS FROM ITS BASE OF UNDERSTANDING AND REALIZING THAT THE WAY COMMERCE IS SHIFTING. IN CITIES IS ACTUALLY TRANSFORMING OVERNIGHT AMER ALL FAMILIAR WITH AN AMAZON LIKE PLATFORMER WALMART DOT COM LIKE PLATFORM. PAPER CONVENIENT HYPER USEFUL BUT THEIR APPROACH IS ACTUALLY BUILDING A WAREHOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF CITIES AND AND FUNNELING THOSE GOODS INTO TOWN. A COMPANY LIKE POST MATES IN WHAT WE CALL THE ON DEMAND SECTOR ACTUALLY APPROACHES IT IN THE INVERSE MODEL WE ACTUALLY TREAT THE ENTIRE CITY AS A WAREHOUSE. WE INDEXED THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS OF LOCAL HARDWARE STORES MOM AND POP RETAILERS BRIGHAM MODE MODEM A PSYCHIATRIC MORTAR MERCHANTS AND THEN GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR GOODS. SO MY NUMBERS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WE OPERATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY U. S. CITIES WE TRANSACT ABOUT THREE MILLION DELIVERIES PER MONTH ON THE PLATFORM. LAST YEAR ALONE WE SOLD ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS ON THE PLATFORM AND INTHE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PER AND ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO RELEASE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT LOCAL RETAILERS HAVE SEEN A GROWTH BY ABOUT THREE POINT SEVEN OR FOUR TIMES AND THE CONCEPT FOR THIS IS QUITE SIMPLE AND THAT'S BECAUSE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN. INSTEAD OF YOU GETTING YOUR LIGHT BULBS FROM AMAZON DOT COM YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THEM FROM A LOCAL HARDWARE STORE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN A MOM AND POP BAKERY OR TALK AREA OWNER OR FOUGHT SHOP OWNER IS ABLE TO. TRANSPORT THEIR GOODS ACROSS TOWN AND NOT ONLY BRIDGE GEOGRAPHIES OF THAT REGION BUT ACTUALLY SELL TO NEW CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER SOLD TO BEFORE BEYOND JUST THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THEIR DINING ROOM. SO FOR US FOOD DELIVERY OR ON DEMAND DELIVERY IS WAY BIGGER THAN JUST BEING. LAZY ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DELIVERED TO YOUR DOORSTEP IT'S TRANSFORMING THE MARKET APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY SMART ALGORITHMS AND COMMERCE AS WE KNOW IT AND WE CAN DO SO IN A WAY THAT INVEST IN THE HELP OF LOCAL ECONOMIES. AS OPPOSED TO AT THE EXCLUSION OF THOSE LOCAL ECONOMIES. UP BUT A BIG PART OF THAT NETWORK FOR POST MATE MATCHING YOU THE CUSTOMER TO A MERCHANT TO A CAREER IS POWERED BY THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ON OUR PART. WE CALL THEM POST MADE I MENTIONED WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACTIVE ON OUR PLATFORM AT ANY GIVEN TIME. ON BALANCE THEY EARN A BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR SO CERTAINLY BETTER THAN MINIMUM WAGE IN MANY JURISDICTIONS BUT WE ASK OURSELVES A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION. HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DO RIGHT BY THESE POST MATES AND ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THOSE HIGH WAGES AND THE PREMISE OF THE IS QUITE SIMPLE? IF WE USE THE POST MAKES PLATFORM RIGHT NOW TO DELIVER TO THIS BUILDING FROM THE STARBUCKS ACROSS THE STREET. A POST MAKE CAREER WOULD BRING IT TO US BUT FINANCIALLY SINCE WE KNOW IT'S JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY IT'S NOT THAT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM SO WE WOULD STARTED OUR EXPERIMENTATION WITH AN A I DRIVEN ROBOTIC SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOUR RESERVING OUR HUMAN CAREERS FOR LONGER DISTANCE RUNS SO THAT WAY THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY OFF THE PLATFORM. NOT SHORT CHANGE THEM AT HYPER SHORT DISTANCE RUNS BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT PENALIZE THAT COFFEE SHOP OR THAT MERCHANT THAT'S CLOSE IN TO YOU OR NEARBY DENSE DOWNTOWN URBAN AREA. AND THAT PREMISE. WAS TOPPLED INITIALLY WITH THE USE OF ROBOTICS WE STARTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WE'VE EXPANDED IN VIRGINIA WISCONSIN PARTS OF TEXAS PARTS OF THE BAY AREA. AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS ACTUALLY SEE CAN WE USE A LITTLE COOLER ON WHEELS THAT USES THE SAME SIMILAR LIGHT OUR TECHNOLOGY IS NOT TAUGHT IN THIS VEHICLE. AND IS SELF LEARNING SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTS AROUND IT THROUGH OUR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN A AYE CAPABILITIES IT CAN HOW CAN IT MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN ENOUGH SO THAT WAY IT AVOIDS. A PEDESTRIAN THAT MAYBE DISABLED AND ISN'T USING A WALKING SICK OR IS IN A WHEELCHAIR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY TO YIELD TO TRAFFIC PATTERNS. AND ALSO NOT CLOG PARTICULARLY DENSE REGIONS I EAT THE SIDEWALKS OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND I THINK FOR US WE STARTED APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY ONE OUT OF THE PROMISE OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT OUR CAREERS CAN BE RESERVED FOR LONGER DISTANCE RUNS. BUT FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE IT'S THAT IF YOU START WITH THAT EARLIER POINT THE WAY COMMERCE INSISTS IT IS MOVING IN CITIES IS CHANGING THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THERE ARE VERY UNIQUE URBAN TOPOGRAPHIES IN EACH. FIREMAN'S SO WE'RE NOT GOING ABOUT THIS PROMISE FOR THIS PRACTICE TO TRY AND REPLACE OUR CAREERS OVERNIGHT WERE ACTUALLY DOING SO SIMPLY TO AUGMENT THAT EXIST IF WE AND SEE HOW WE CAN BE MINDFUL OF SUPER. SHORT DISTANCES ALONG THE WAY. ALL SAY THAT PER THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS HEARING WE'VE LEARNED A COUPLE OF INSIGHTS ONE WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE ROBOTICS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN STARTING IN THE SEA. WITHOUT IMPACTING A SINGLE HUMAN JOB ON. WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO RESERVE OUR CAREERS TO MAKE MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT. TO WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DEPLOY FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD VIA THE POST MAKES PLATFORM IN SOME OF OUR SELECT TEST CITIES SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HARP TATTERSALL'S IN THE BACK AND SAY THAT THIS MEANS CONGESTION IS GOING AWAY OVERNIGHT. BUT WE'RE TAKING INCREMENTAL STEPS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. THREE WHEN IT CAME TO OUR APPROACH OF DEPLOYING THESE IN TOWNS WE TOOK A FUNDAMENTAL. RESPECT FOR GOVERNMENT AND PRIORITIZE THAT FIRST MEANING THAT WE DO NOT OPERATE A GO TO MARKET WITHOUT TALKING TO LOCAL MAYOR'S OFFICES STATE GOVERNMENT'S DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT OF TRADE PETITIONS AND PART OF THAT FRAMEWORK INSURED A DATA SHARE. IN WHICH ANY DATA THAT WE WERE GETTING OUT OF THE EXPERIMENTATION INCLUDING ANY GUIDELINES WE HAD AROUND PRIVACY DISPOSAL IF THAT LIGHT OUR TECHNOLOGY WAS MONITORING ARE FILMING AROUND IT WE WOULD ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT ON THEIR TERMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT WE WOULD COMPLY WITH THEIR NEEDS. AND IT ACTUALLY ALLOWED US TO WORK WITH THE NEW JOB TYPES WE NOTICED THAT VETERANS FROM THE AIRFORCE AND THE NAVY PARTICULARLY POST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN THAT ARE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR ROBOTIC FLEET MANAGEMENT SON SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED. SOARED TO PLOWSHARES TO HIRE FOR THIS SPECIFICALLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS TO ENGAGE IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SO WE CAN TRAIN UP FOLKS TO ENGAGE THIS FLEET OF ROBOTICS. BUT ULTIMATELY I'LL CONCLUDE WITH THIS STATEMENT AND THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WHETHER YOU TAKE OUR USE CASE OF A AYE OR OTHER USE CASES OF A AYE THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND AS WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR. THEY'RE GOING TO BE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE INCLUSIVE SYSTEMS NON BIASED SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS THAT WORK FOR THE GROWTH OFHUMAN JOBS ALL ALONG THE WAY. AND I KIND OF JUST ONE ARRIVE AT THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE CHAIRMAN WITH THE SIMPLE MESSAGE AS THE LONE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT SHOWED UP FOR THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT WE ACTUALLY REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH LABOR AND WE APPLAUD ACTUALLY THE TEAMSTERS FOR WORKING WITH ROBOTICS COMPANY IS AN ICE. PACK SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL CONVERSATION WHERE THE CITY TRIED TO BAN ROBOTICS WE WANT TO WORK WITH LABOR TO MAKE SURE THAT IF FOR TRAINING AND NEXT GENERATION OR CURRENT GENERATION. OF HARDWARE MECHANICS AND THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE THESE FANCY STANFORD COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ENGAGE THROUGH. VOCATIONAL TRAINING ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND CONTINUOUS LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT CERTAINLY EXTEND BE ON THE STEM INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT AN EARLIER STAGE LEVEL BUT CAN ALSO ACCOUNT FOR LATER STAGE INVESTMENT. AND FINALLY I THINK THAT IF WE GIVE OURSELVES AND GIVE INDUSTRY I HAVE BECOME A THE PITCH THEY'VE WILL GIVE INDUSTRY THE CHANCE TO EXPERIMENT AND WE USE CITIES OR USE YOUR DISTRICTS ARE YOU STATES. AS THE PETRI DISH OF TESTING THEN THE MORE DATA THAT WE GET THE MORE WE CAN SHARE BACK OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE MORE THAT WE TEST THESE TOOLS THE MORE THAT A AYE WHICH IS SELF LEARNING CAN ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR STRUCTURAL BIASES AND IMPROVE OVER TIME AND THE MORE WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE GAPS ARE THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE TOGETHER. SO THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THIS SPACE TO TRULY ACTUALIZE IT THERE'S A LOT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE AS A TECH COMPANY WANT TO TAKE A PARDON SO WE SUPPORT BILLS GOING ON IN THIS. LEGISLATURE WHEN TO COME SYSTEM INVESTMENT FOR CONTINUOUS LEARNING INVESTMENTS BUT WE ALSO WANT THE ROOM TO TEST SO THAT WAY WE CAN BE WORKING PARTNERS AS OPPOSE TO SPARRING PARTNERS. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T JUST COMPETE WITH OTHER STATES. WE CAN BE WITH THE REST THE WORLD SO FRANKLY FOR US THIS IS ALSO ABOUT THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE STATE THAT WE GET TO CALL HOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR MESSAGE NEXT. CAN WE GO TO MR ALL PAUL HOW DO THEM THAT I SECRETLY. DATA PLAGUE. THAT MISTAKEN NUMBER FOUND. I THANK YOU VERY ME SO I REPRESENT. MIND STRONG HOW. BY WAY BACKGROUND I'M A COMPUTER SCIENTIST PHD AND MD FROM STANFORD AND RESIDENTS AT STANFORD. AND I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW WE'RE FEELING A SHORTAGE OF PURSES? DISPLACING SERVICE WORKERS. AT MY SON HELP WE'VE DEVELOPED A WHEN THE BIG CHALLENGES MENTAL HEALTH WERE DRESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THERE'S A CABINET JANET DISORDERS. IN THE BIG CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ACCESS AND MEASUREMENT. SO IN MENTAL HEALTH TODAY OUR STATISTICS ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE ONE IN THREE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE ADMITTED. EVERY TWELVE MONTHS INTO THE HOSPITAL. WHEN INTO PETITIONS HE'S GOING TO PATIENTS WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AN OPIATE USE DISORDER GARY ADMITTED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS. IT'S THAT THEY WERE IT WE'RE NOT DOING VERY GOOD AT MANAGING A WHAT'S BECOMING A CRISIS LUNCHES HERE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT. A GLOBAL CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN WHAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN SMART IT'S. A AYE TRIP THEN IT'S TAKEN SIX YEARS OF ARE INDEED. EXCEPT A A LOT OF INVESTMENT A LOT OF TIME AND AND AND A LOT OF SACRIFICE FROM BROUGH VERY TALENTED TEAM. IS THE ABILITY TO PASSIVELY ACQUIRED DATA FROM PEOPLE SMARTPHONE THAT DIGITAL HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION DATA AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND REPRODUCE GOLD STANDARD NO COGNITIVE METRICS FOR FOR THESE PATIENTS WE CAN NOW UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE. IS FUNCTIONING COGNITIVELY WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING EMOTIONALLY ARE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT MATTERS MOST. WHERE THERE POTENTIALLY SEE A HAVING DIFFICULTY COPING STRESSING? AND WENT WHERE THINGS ULTIMATELY WHERE. IT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT BAD OUTCOMES LIKE SUICIDE IT HAPPENS YOU KNOW IT DOES THE DOES NOT HAPPEN THE CLINIC IT HAPPENS AT TWO IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DEVELOPED AND THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE NOT JUST THE MEASUREMENT TOWNS BUT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE ACCESS PROBLEM THE ACCESS PROBLEM TO HELP. ALICE'S NIGHTS IS GOOD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER HELP AND THE MOBILE PHONE THE SMARTPHONE IS THE PERFECT TOOL PERFECT DEVICE FOR TELEHEALTH WE'VE DEVELOPED. A MODEL OF INTERACTIVE HEALTH. THAT TAKES BAD. INITIAL SIGNAL AND DELIVERS VERY QUICKLY A MIND STRONG A AYE SOLUTION THAT INTERVENES USING. NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERACTION WITH A WITH A PERSON TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ESCALATE A SITUATION TO EIGHT ACT I CARE PROVIDER. IF. THAT IF IT'S URGENT AND. NEEDS IT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE THE ABILITY NOW TO. CARE FOR A A VERY. DIFFICULT A SET OF. POPULATION. THAT. HAS BEEN LARGELY DISENFRANCHISED. AND. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT OUR APPROACH AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT JUST A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND WE HAVE NO SOLUTION THAT NOT JUST. ADDRESSES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY BUT POTENTIALLY GET THAT LEAK PRODUCTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAN ALLOW US TO ADDRESS A CHALLENGES AND OTHER THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AS WELL. SO THAT'S ON THE GOOD SIDE AND I THINK IT'S ALL VERY EXCITING WE pAN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WITH SOME THE TOP. UNIVERSITIES AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE DO THAT IN A PRO BONO. MODEL WHERE WE DON'T WE DON'T CHARGE THEM ANYTHING WE DO ENORMOUS WANNA WORK WITH. DRUG MANUFACTURERS. TO IN ADOPTING A NEW DRUGS TARGETED UP PHARMACEUTICALS. AND THAT OUR LICENSE HERE COMMERCIAL PLATFORM IN WE'RE INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THIS COUNTRY'S LARGEST PAIR PROVIDERS SYSTEMS. TO HELP ADDRESS THIS THIS EXCITING USE OF A AYE I THINK. YOU IT IT. IF THERE WERE A POTENTIAL. CONCERNED IT WOULD BE A AND YEAH POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THIS TYPE APPROACH AS YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH THE THE YOUNG THE. APPLICATIONS OPPORTUNITIES AND. RISKS OF A AYE YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT. IT WOULD BE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL COULD COULD BE. YOU WOULD WE GO DIRECTLY THROUGH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IF WE'RE LOOKING DIRECT CONSUMER MODEL. THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS IN TERMS OF. HOW PATIENT OR PERSON WOULD? USES TECHNOLOGY. AND POTENTIALLY AND MISUSES OF THE OF THE ABILITY TO MEASURE A COGNITION AND MOOD. IN IN THE FORM OF NARROW NO MARKETING AND OTHER SUCH APPLICATIONS BUT I THINK THAT. IN IN IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'RE VERY EXCITED. WITH WHAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND. THE OPPORTUNITY AND HOPE THAT WOULD BRING TO A LARGE POT. SEGMENT OF POPULATION THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ES NEXT SO CAN WE GO TO MISTER IMAD KEIKO. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME PRESSING ISSUES IN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MY NAME IS MAC HAGEL AND I AM A TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BASINS ARE CISCO. SO SO MUCH MY WORK FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT MODERN DIGITAL SYSTEMS. WHETHER THEY BE PRIVATE PLATFORMS ARE PUBLIC PROJECTS ARE PUBLICLY DEBATED AND IMPLEMENTED WITH EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND MINE. SO WITH THAT IN MIND. I WANNA TALK MORE BIG PICTURE ABOUT A AYE. SO YOU MAY ALREADY BE FAMILIAR WITH A AYE POWERED AYE VOICE ASSISTANCE AND STORIES DESCRIBING HOW A AYE IS GOING TO BRING ABOUT SELF DRIVING CARS. AYE BUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH ITS POWER TO FIND PATTERNS IN LARGE DATA SETS. AND TO AUTOMATE DECISIONS PREVIOUSLY LEFT. TO HUMANS IS POISED A FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLES PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS. I'LL A AYE POWER SYSTEMS THAT FOR IT FACILITATE PERVASIVE SURVEILLANCE AND INFLUENCE CONSEQUENTIAL ON PERSONAL DECISIONS. ESPECIALLY WHEN DEPLOYED WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE RAISE THE RISK. CRADLE TO GRAVE TRACKING. THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY. IN THESE EFFORTS APPLICATIONS A AYE IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF QUOTE MODERNS THREAT TO PERSONAL PRIVACY. THAT ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF OUR CONSTITUTION WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. BASIC DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS IS ALSO UNDERMINED WHEN SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING OUR LIVES SUCH AS WHERE PUBLIC RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED OR WHETHER AN OFFICER. CONFRONTS A PERSON WITH DEADLY FORCE ARE INFLUENCED BY PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS RUNNING SECRET ALGORITHMS ANALYZING POTENTIALLY BIAS DATA. AND WITHOUT RULES IN PLACE TO PREVENT ABUSE. SO THE STAKES FOR A AYE SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH ESPECIALLY IN RIGHT AND IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RUSHING TO EXPLOIT AUTOMATED SYSTEMS AT LOCAL LEVEL IN VIOLATION OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THEY WANT YOU SEE SYSTEMS TO TRACK TARGET AND THE POOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE MUST NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS THOUGHTFULLY EXPLORING A TODAY AND AND HOW WE CAN SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO ADDRESSING POLICY ISSUES RELATED CA I. AND ITS USE IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTEXT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE A AYE IS ALREADY POWERING SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES HEARING CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING SOFTWARE THAT SCOURS BILLIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS THAT SCAN PEOPLE'S FACES AND EYES LIKE A SCENE FROM MINORITY REPORT. AND LICENSE PLATE READERS THAT TRACK ARE DRIVING PATTERNS. AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AS A SAID BEFORE SUCH AS ICE ARE MOVING RAPIDLY TO CONSCRIPT CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S DEPORTATION MACHINE. SOCIAL MEDIA SURROUNDS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN TWENTIES IN A TWENTY SIXTEEN PUBLIC RECORDS VESTED ASIAN. THE ACLU RIVER DISCOVERED THAT MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF SURVEYED CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE USING AUTOMATED SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE. THESE TOOLS ARE SPECIFICALLY MARTIC MARKETED TO CALIFORNIA AGENCIES FOR PURPOSES OF MONITORING. AND TARGETING UNIONS. ACTIVISTS OF COLOR SO SHE WOULD LIKEWISE MATTER AND PROTESTERS CHARACTERIZING THEM AS OVERT THREATS. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE MISUSED. IN SAN JOSE WE LEARNED THAT POLICE MONITORED ASIAN. MUSLIM AND SIKH PROTESTERS. IN FRESNO POLICE CALLED USED A PRODUCT CALLED BEWARE THAT ASSIGN COLOR THREAT LEVELS TO RESIDENTS BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS. AND BILLIONS OF OTHER COMMERCIAL RECORDS. OFFICERS RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS WILL BE SHOWN CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY SECRET ALGORITHMS. WHEN ONE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOUND HIMSELF FLAG IS AN ELEVATED THREAT HE HAD NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE BASIS FOR THAT DECISION. THERE WERE NO RULES GOVERNING THE USE THAT SYSTEM. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WAS NOT UNIQUE TO FRESNO SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERIMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SOCIAL OF CALIFORNIA LOOK COUNTIES THAT WE SURVEYED. COULD NOT PRODUCE A SINGLE RECORD OF PUBLIC DEBATE. OR WRITTEN POLICIES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATORY TARGETING. NEITHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS NOR LAWMAKERS HAVE ANY WAY TO KNOW HOW THE SYSTEMS ACTUALLY WORK. NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENT TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS. TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR IMMIGRANTS VIA PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE QUOTE EXTREME THAT INITIATIVE. CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE ALSO PILOTED ADVANCED A AYE POWERED FACIAL AND IRIS RECOGNITION SO SURVEILLANCE. THESE SYSTEMS AUTOMATE THE PERVASIVE TRACKING OF INDIVIDUALS AT PROTESTS. AND INCORPORATE ALARMINGNOTIONS OF WHO SHOULD BE DEEMED SUSPICIOUS. SINCE AT LEAST TWENTY FIFTEEN SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES HAVE USE THAT TECHNOLOGY FIRST DEPLOYED. BY US FORCES IN IRAQ. TO COLLECT IRIS PHOTOS FROM THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. COUNTY SHERIFF'S ALONG THE US MEXICO BORDER HAVE ANNOUNCED A PLANS TO DO THE SAME. FISH OVER CAN'T FIGURE FISHER RECOGNITION ON THE OTHER HAND IS NOW POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TRACK PEOPLE IN REAL TIME. ENGAGING INPROTECTED SPEECH AT PROTESTS ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES ALL WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. SOME OF THESE COMPANIES CLAIM THAT THEY CAN ESTIMATE DEMOGRAPHICS AND PREDICT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR SOLELY BASED ON A PHOTO OF A FACE. THESE OUTLANDISH CLAIMS INVITE POLICE TO MAKE A LIFE FOR DEATH DECISIONS BASED ON LEGALLY PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS. AND UNVERIFIED PSEUDOSCIENCE. AND RIGHT NOW IT'S I. SUGGESTED BEFORE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS AGGRESSIVELY IN ITS CAMPAIGN TO TARGET IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. JUST LAST MONTH I STRUCK A DEAL WITH A NATIONWIDE AYE I STRUCK A DEAL WITH A LICENSE PLATE READER COMPANY CALLED VIGILANT TO GET ACCESS TO A NATIONWIDE LICENSE PLATE DATABASE. FEATURING THE LOCATIONS OF DRIVERS COLLECTED BY THE VENDORS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CUSTOMERS. IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT. AN ESTIMATED HUNT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE VIGILANT SYSTEMS IN SOME FORM. LICENSE PLATE SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY RIGHT FOR ABUSE POLICE IN NEW YORK HAVE USE LICENSE PLATE READERS TO SPY A MUSLIM AMERICANS AND MOSQUES. AND BLIND RELIANCE ON THESE READERS IN SAN FRANCISCO LED TO A AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN BEING DETAINED AT GUNPOINT. WHICH TRIGGERED A MULTI YEAR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT. I SEARCHING FOR PLATE NUMBERS IN THIS DATABASE ICE INTENDS TO TRACK AND TARGET CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON THEIR CARS TO DRIVE TO WORK. TO RUN ERRANDS AND TO TAKE KIDS TO SCHOOL. SO A AYE IS HERE ALREADY. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES LACK THE MECHANISMS TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS OR TO FOLLOW A CONSISTENT PROCEDURE TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS. WE'RE YOU KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PLACE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS WITH LITTLE TO NO TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY OR OVERSIGHT. OUR STATEWIDE. REVIEW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF PUBLIC DEBATE. A PROCEEDING ACQUISITIONS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PROGRAMS WE SURVEYED. WE FOUND A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE USE POLICY FOR FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE THESE PROGRAMS. AND MANY OF THESE POLICIES AMENITIES PROGRAMS HAD NO POLICY WHATSOEVER. CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANT CHANGE THERE IS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR LAWMAKERS TO DEVELOP ENFORCEABLE STATE AND LOCAL LIMITS. ON SURVEILLANCE CHECK NOT TECHNOLOGY AND TO REQUIRE LOCAL APPROVAL AND A VOTE BEFORE USE. SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS WANT CITYWIDE POLICIES TO SET LIMITS ON SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. USED BY POLICE ACCORDING TO TWENTY FIFTEEN POLL. WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT PUBLIC DEBATE AREN'T OR ENFORCEABLE RULES COMMUNITIES WILL PURCHASE EXPENSIVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS. I DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THAT FEE DATABASE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK TO EXPLOIT. AND THAT CAN UNDERMINE DUE PROCESS BY PLACING THE BASIS FOR DECISIONS BEHIND SECRET ALGORITHMS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD TO BLINDLY RELY ON A AYE SYSTEMS. WHICH MEAN THAT POWER IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEPORTATION MISSION OR WHOSE DECISIONS MAYBE FLAT OUT WRONG BECAUSE OF BIAS DATA OR HUMAN ERROR. SO NOW'S THE TIME TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BUILT ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE TRANSPARENT AND SUBJECTED TO MEANINGFUL PUBLIC DEBATE. ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER CALVET CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS TO ADDRESS THESE IMPORTANT PRICING ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A. LET'S NEXT GO TO MISTER JOHNSON FILMING WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEF SHEESH. WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN FELDMAN SAYS THAT CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. HERE BASICALLY DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING HAVE HIGH SCHOOL HE SAID. NO BUT I MEAN I'D SERIOUSLY I. SO I GET I GET THE CONCERNS IN THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THIS DEBATE THERE'S THE PRIVACY. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT INTRUSION INTO PRIVATE LIVES SIDE WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S ON THE FARTHEST EDGE YOU KNOW IT'S ALL. INTRUSIVE. USING IT FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES TO TRACK YOU DOWN. KEEP TABS ON YOU FOR WHATEVER REASONS THAT WE WANT OUTSIDE OF YOU KNOW CRIMINAL OR. INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES. BIT THAT ARE SO I MEAN AND ON THE OTHER SIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WOULD SAY THAT WE USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. WERE FACING INCREASING THREATS AND WE SEE THESE THESE. MASS EVENTS OF VIOLENCE. IT EVERY SO OFTEN IT SEEMS LIKE MORE AND MORE. AND THEN I'D KNOW CHECKS US ALL OF THE CORE AND WE TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN WE DO TO PREVENT IT AND TECHNOLOGY IS A SOLUTION IT'S GOING TO BE A. SOME IT'S USEFUL TO SAVE A LOT OF LIVES BUT THERE IS GONNA BE A BALLOTS THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN OUR TWO SIDES. ON WHERE'D WHERE'D IS. PUBLIC INPUT. ALLOW THE CITIZENS TO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHERE TO GO TOO FAR TO WEAR ALLOWS. OFFENDERS AND PERPETRATORS. AN ADVANTAGE AGAINST US SO THAT'S THE DEBATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY HERE IT'S ALREADY. IT'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BEING USED BY A BUSINESS IS HEALTH COMPANIES. WHEN OUR SOCCER. CYBER DEFENSES LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE PUBLIC HAS IT YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S. A. SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT. CONCERNS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW OUR PERSONAL. LIVES BEING. CONSTANTLY FOLLOWED CONSTANTLY MONITORED AND IT'S IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IF IT'S NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT ITS MARKETING COMPANIES THAT. YOUR FRIENDS POSTING PHOTOS OF YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO. MINUTES IT'S THERE SO LET'S FIND A WAY TO BALANCE THAT BETWEEN ALL OF OUR INTERESTS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRYING TO. NOW WITH OUR INTERESTS. ALWAYS BEEN PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST. SO QUICKLY CANADA I. WHAT WE HAVE OUT NOW AND AND? THEN I'LL TRY AND DRAW A LINE TO WEAR COULD GO IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW FIRST THAT IS THE FIRST. PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND NETWORK THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING NATIONWIDE IT'S CAN BE A NETWORK SOLELY A. THE SOLE PURPOSE IS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE. FAST ACCESS TO INTERNET SERVICES IN REMOTE AREAS. CALIFORNIA JUST OPTED IN SO WILL BE DEVELOPING IN HERE IN THE STATE. AYE WE WANT THE FIGHT FOR PRIORITY USE OF THE AIRWAVES WITH OTHER. PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE WHO ELSE. I'M. COULD BE INTERFERING SO THAT'S CAN BE A GREAT THING. ITS ITS MOBILE OVER CAN BE ABLE TO CREATE HOTSPOTS IN SOME OF THOSE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS BEEN A HUGE ISSUE. I'D SPECIALLY VIEW GET FAR UP NORTH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH IS NOT A LOT OF SERVICES. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS RELIED ON EVIDENCE AND DATA COLLECTION AND WE'VE GOT REALLY GOOD AT COLLECTING MORE AND MORE DATA BUT. PARSING THROUGH HIS BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT THE MORE WE COLLECT. I MEAN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF BODY CAM FOOTAGE. MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS ON. FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND AND WHAT NOT. IT TAKES HOURS AND HOURS MAN HOURS TO GO THROUGH COME THROUGH AND FIND CONNECTIONS AND PUT TOGETHER AND A LOT OF TIMES WERE OPERATING MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS. THAT WE HAVE TO USE. I. TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND SO HAVING A. SOME. ANALYTICAL HELP FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO GO THROUGH THAT COME THROUGH THAT FIND PATTERNS I KNOW THAT IS GOING TO CONCERNS ABOUT BIAS IN. WHAT THOSE ANALYTICS ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE? YOU NO BUT WE ARE OR BY SEEN FOR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE TRYING TO DO. WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ANY ONE PARTICULAR GROUP AN ART I KNOW THE BE EXAMPLES THAT ARE GONNA CLEAR. CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT BY. YOU KNOW SOMEONE STANDARDS BUT THAT'S NEVER THE INTENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A WHOLE. OUTSIDE OF THE. ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES IS IS FOCUSED ON CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S WHAT WERE. I MEAN PEOPLE RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR NIGHT OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW AND MASTER. DOES SUBVERT ANYONE GROUP ANOTHER. SO HAVING THAT. ARTIFICIAL TIMES TO HELP COME THROUGH THAT DATA. IDENTIFY CRIMINAL PATTERNS. IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS ON THIS CAN BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR US. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DRONES ALIVE. YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE PRETTY UBIQUITOUS. AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I MEAN FOR EVERYTHING FROM. DELIVERY SERVICES OF GOODS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU CIVILIAN ONLY GOT DRONES THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYED OUT THE BACK OF THE SWAT VEHICLE. I YOU KNOW FLY OVERHEAD SCOUT A SCENE FOR US SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE WALKING INTO THAT'S GOING TO SAVE LIVES. A FIRE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL WITH INFRARED. THERMAL HEAT SENSORS THAT CAN IDENTIFY WHERE THE HOT SPOTS THE FIRE OR. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW. THINGS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY OUT THERE IT'S ONLY GONNA GET BETTER. I'M AND MORE PREVALENT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HAVE SOME FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S A. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST GONNA KEEP GROWING AND GETTING BETTER. YOU KNOW IT'S. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IS IS BEING USED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A LOT WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF IT. BUT THAT'S GONNA CONTINUE TO GET DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS. SO I YOU KNOW ALL. I TALK TO A FEW CHEESE BEFORE COMING TODAY TO TO TALK TO YOU AND. WE KIND OF DISCUSSED SOME. POTENTIAL SCENARIOS OF WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE THAT'S WHEN THE QUESTIONS I ASKED EMANATE WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS. SAW PAINT THIS PICTURE FOR YOU GUYS. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED TO A SCENE. WHICH IS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY AND. FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THERE'S NOTICED A CRIME ALERTED THE OFFICER THE OFFICER ARRIVES IN A TON OF THIS VEHICLE. BEFORE EXITING THE VEHICLE DRONES LAUNCHED FROM THE VEHICLE FLIES OVERHEAD IT READS EVERYONE'S FACES IT FINDS OUT. ARE THERE ANY WARRANTS ARE THE ARMED. DO THEY HAVE ANY PRIOR CONVICTIONS ANY VIOLENT PAST. AND I CAN READ HEART RATES TO FIND OUT IS THIS PERSON STRESSED BY THE ANGRY. ARE THEY. SCARED OF READ THEIR FACIAL A TEXT ACTUALLY FIND OUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE MOTIONS ARE HOW THEY'RE FEELING US THE OFFICES CAN HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION BEFORE THEY EVEN GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE. A LITTLE PROTECT THE OFFICER. YOU KNOW. NO MORE CHP OFFICERS YOU KNOW WALKING UP TO A CAR WINDOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT DARK IN NOT KNOWING WHO'S INSIDE THEY WILL KNOW. AND THEY'LL BE ABLE ACT ACCORDINGLY I MEAN WE'RE WORKING ON DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE STRESSED OUT BEFORE YOU GET OUT THE CAR AND GO AND TALK TO THEM. IF YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. THEY'RE NOT ARMED THEY DON'T OF ANY PRIORS YOU WILL HELP YOU. ADJUST THAT SITUATION A DE ESCALATED. ON THE FLIP SIDE IF YOU THEY ARE ARMED THEY ARE DANGEROUS THEY DO HAVE A WARRANT. ON IT'S GONNA PROTECT THE OFFICERS LIVES. SO THAT'S KIND ALL WHERE WE'RE HEADED. YOU KNOW IT'S A. NO WE ALL SEE THE MOVIES SKYNET. TERMINATION ERA. MINORITY REPORT I MEAN IT'S IT'S. NOT TOO FAR FETCHED THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE IN OUR LIFETIMES. ASIDE I DO THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY VIGILANT CONTINUE THESE DEBATES AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH JOB FOR THE LEGISLATORS DRAW THAT LINE. I'VE WHERE PUBLIC SAFETY. CONCERNS. NOT OUT WAY PRIVACY CONCERNS BUT. OUR BALANCED WITH THEM. HAVE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GENTLEMEN WITHOUT. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I ME ON EARLIER A DOCTOR DEEGAN TALK LIVE AT ABOUT. THE USE OF A AYE IN THE TOWN TO DETECTION OF MENTAL. OF THE ONLY MOTION OR COGNITION ON KIND OF. RELATED. BEHAVIOR SO TO SPEAK ANNA ANNA YOU ALSO MENTION ABOUT THE. YOU KNOW IT BEING USED ARE IN THE. PREDICTION OF SUICIDAL AT TIMES SO I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY ARE THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN IN AND WERE ARE WE I MEAN OUR. IN AND WE CAN WE CAN WE DEPLOY THE USE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW TO EVEN A GREATER EXTENT. A. IT IT'S BEEN A ASIDE FROM A SUICIDE WHICH WE HAVE REAL EXPORT BOY. THE ABILITY TO TO TACTIC COGNITION AND. IMPACT OF. EMOTION ON COGNITION THINGS LIKE STRESS ANXIETY. TRAUMA. HEAD TRAUMA. HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE WE HAVE. THE RECENT PAPERS COMING OUT IN NATURE THAT DEMONSTRATES OUR RESULTS AGAINST GOLD STANDARD PASSED THE DIFFERENCE HERE SO WE CAN NOW MEASURE THAT IS ECOLOGICALLY. AND SOMEONE STATED ENVIRONMENT HOW POSSIBLY REMOTELY WITHOUT A PERSON HAVING SOMEONE COME TO THE CLINIC AND UNDERGO FOR OUR RURAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT. THE SAME GOES FOR. MEASURING DEPRESSION ANXIETY. HEY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACTIVE. CLINICAL STUDIES. WITH DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE USING ARE A POP FORM COMMERCIALLY TO TRY TO IDENTIFY BETTER. DRUGS. FOR THESE DISORDERS. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF US SEVERAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS. WITH. SOME OF THE LARGEST. IT APPEARS IN PRODUCTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IN THE UK AND IN SINGAPORE RIGHT NOW SO IT'S. IT'S EARLY EARLY PHASE BY THINK BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. YOU'LL CERTAINLY BE READING. WE HOPE ABOUT SOME OF THE SUCCESSES BOTH ARE IN LARGE SCALE. PROJECTS HERE WITHIN THE U. S.. GOD I THINK YOU AND MR LIEBER TALK LIVE IT ABOUT CYBER. ON AND THE USE OF A AYE IN IN CYBER WORLD ARM IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT HE I WAS BEING USED BY. OTHER NATIONS STATE WHO TO ARM. ATTACK OUR ELECTION SYSTEM THAT YOU COULD TELL. I WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY. I FINALLY MISTER FELDMAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND NETWORK PRO PROJECT AT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS JUST OPTED IN. AYE HER LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ALSO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING OPERATED ON ARE BY EIGHTEEN THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WE. SIT IN MOST RECEIPTS HAVE OPTED AND IF IT'S NOT CORRECT RIGHT SO IF YOU CAN COME TO ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT SO WOOD. SO THAT PROJECT IS BASICALLY OUR. DRIVEN BY A AYE IS IS THAT NOT WHAT IT IS OR WILL DO THAT TO. IT THAT IS A PROGRAM IS USED TO IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS AND AND A CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES NOBODY'S OUT HOW DID I WAS JUST A NETWORK OKAY THAT'S JUST THIS THE DEDICATED. BROADBAND NETWORK THAT'S GONNA BE SOLELY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY SO I PICKED SUSAN FIRE SO GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHER STATES RIGHT NOW. IS THAT HE ATTEND YEAH IT WILL BE A TO BE NATIONWIDE WHEN IT SOLOMON RUNNING. BUT IT'S IT'S A DEDICATED HIGH SPEED NETWORK FOR US TO USE BUT THERE'S NO CONTENT OR ANYTHING ON THAT JUST A NETWORK THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COMMUNICATION. A CAPABILITY. OKAY I GOT OKAY VERY GOOD WELL YOU THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR. QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL GENTLEMEN FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES. AND I WILL BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL. THE FINAL PANEL FOR THE DATE IS GOING TO HELP US EXAMINE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE PUBLIC POLICY LANDS. AND JOINING US AGAIN IS SO PROFESSOR ROUGH HARGROVE. AND ALSO WE HAVE SARA FLOCK SO WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION A SEMANTIC CORBIN WITH PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE IN THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. AND IN A ROW. VICE PRESIDENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LITIGATION ARE FROM ADOBE. SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US OUR WELCOME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. OF THE. YEAH ONE CHAIR SITUATED YOU MAY PROCEED. AND. SINCE WE STARTED WITH THE PROFESSOR GROWTH LAST TIME SO LET'S MAYBE WE'LL GO WITH THAT. SIT ON THIS THAT SERVE* WITH A CALIFORNIA LABOR FOR WHILE WE SEE. WITH IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MISSED A PROFESSOR GRAPH AGAIN TO START OFF. ANY ANY. ANY SEQUENCE SURE LET'S DO THAT. ABSOLUTE PLEASE PLEASE DIFFERENT TOPICS. OKAY SO I. MADE MY HUMBLE OPINION AS I SAID BEFORE CALIFORNIA PASSED A LEAD. PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE BENEFIT FROM THE GROWTH OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CREATE HERE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD. PARTIALLY BASED ON OPEN SOURCE AND WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY. ABOUT HOW IT OF PANS OUT NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT GLOBALLY. IN ORDER TO. GET OUR ARMS AROUND. WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE WE NEED TO STUDY THE PROBLEMS MUCH MORE CAREFULLY? IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT ON JOBS WE SINCERELY DON'T KNOW TODAY WHAT THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE ARE GOING TO BE. WE HAVE LOTS OF CONSULTANCY REPORTS THAT TELL US WHAT SOME OF THE JOBS JOB CATEGORIES COULD BE IN THE FUTURE BUT FRANKLY THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ONE FOUR ONE. TEMPLATE JOBS THESE ARE THOUGHTFUL. PROVOCATIONS TO HELP US THINK ABOUT SOME NEW FACETS OF JOBS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO. IS TO ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT TYPES OF JOB SKILLS AND TASKS COULD BE EMERGING. RIGHT AND THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SHOULD CONSIST OF NOTCHES BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ENGINEERS BUT FRANKLY AND APOLOGISTS SOCIOLOGISTS. DESIGN PROFESSIONALS WHO UNDERSTAND ETHNIC GRAPHICS HE COULD HAVE WHO CAN HELP US EXERCISE SOME FORESIGHT ON THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. I EIGHT TAKE A NOTE OF THE COMMENT THAT WE HEARD FROM THE THE GENTLEMAN. FROM THE LABOR UNION. THAT. RETRAINING SCHEMES HAVE BEEN FAULTY. ARE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A SUCCESS WAS THEY SHOULD BE AND I WOULD CERTAINLY CONCUR THAT IF IT TAKES. THREE YEARS TO RETRAIN FOR A NEW JOB THAT MIGHT FRANKLY BE OBSOLETE BY THE TIME THE TRAINING ENDS. AND THEN NOT BE MATCH FOR JOBS IS A NON SEQUITUR. SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS ONE OF THE THINGS ON A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP PLATFORM. THAT WE COULD ADD IS ACTUAL JOB MATCHING. WE'RE DOING THIS ALREADY ON LINE. AND IT'S NOT IDEAL IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT THERE IS REALLY NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T PAIR INSIGHTS ON THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE WITH SOME INCENTIVE SYSTEMS FOR CORPORATIONS. ARE. AND FOR ACADEMICS TO JOINTLY DECIDE AND DESIGN THESE JOBS AND THEN PLACE PEOPLE INTO THEM. RIGHT WE DO THIS ALREADY IN OTHER AREAS OF LIFE. WITNESS YOU KNOW MATCH DOT COM A PARTNER SEARCH AT SUCH A THAT WHY WOULD WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW SUITABLE SOMEBODY IS FOR AN EXISTING. OR NEW JOB PROFILE US THAT'S ANOTHER IDEA. THE. THE KEY ELEMENT OF GETTING THE DIFFERENT SIDES TO WORK TOGETHER OF COURSE AS EVERYWHERE ELSE IN LIFE IS INCENTIVES. SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE CORPORATIONS TO. TO. PLAY THEIR PART IN THIS. A NUMBER ONE OF COURSE STRATEGICALLY NO CORPORATE EXECUTIVE. IS INTERESTED IN HAVING PUBLIC OPINION TURNED AGAINST THEM WHEN JOBS GET LOST WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO LAY OFF BE LAID OFF SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT WE NEED TO GET MUCH MORE CONCRETE AND HANDS ON TACTICAL ABOUT THIS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. THE I. WITHOUT WANTING TO BECOME TOO POLITICAL HERE BUT THE RECENT. TAX BILL THAT PASSED. DOES FRANKLY NOTHING TO ENSURE THAT CORPORATION SPEND SOME OF THAT MONEY TO DESIGN THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE AND PUT PEOPLE INTO THEM THERE ARE SOME CORPORATIONS. THAT ARE GOOD AT THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. BUT MOST ARE FRANKLY MUCH TOO PREOCCUPIED WITH SHORTER TERM GOALS AND RIGHTLY SO. IN ORDER TO DEVOTE MUCH ENERGY AND RESOURCES TO THESE JOB DESIGNS THAT MAY NOT A BECOME RELEVANT. NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER BUT RATHER FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS OUT SO WHY NOT DEVELOP A TAX INCENTIVE SCHEME. THAT SAYS HERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. THAT WILL KICK IN WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN THESE JOB DESIGN PLATFORMS AND WHEN YOU HELP US PUT PEOPLE INTO THOSE JOBS. S. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER. SUGGESTION HERE TO GET QUITE CONCRETE. ABOUT THIS. NEXT. I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE TO. MAKE SURE THAT DATA WHICH IS REALLY THE CURRENCY OF POWER. A GETS. DEMOCRATIZED. AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. NUMBER ONE IS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OPEN DATA PLATFORMS. WHERE? CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE TO DEPOSIT THEIR DATA POSSIBLY BECOME CONCEITED BY THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE USE OF THE DATA. BUT I THINK IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE TO HAVE SIX LARGE CORPORATIONS AROUND THE WORLD OWN ALL THE DATA. SO WE WE HAVE TO PUT SOME THINKING INTO OPEN DATA PLATFORMS. EQUALLY THEN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO GIVE DATA OWNERSHIP TO INDIVIDUALS. I MAY WANT TO GIVE UP MY DATA IN ORDER TO GET CONVENIENCE'S SERVICES EXPERIENCES PRODUCTS. BOB BUT I SHOULD HAVE OWNERSHIP OVER THAT AND I SHOULD DETERMINE WHETHER AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME I WANT TO GIVE UP OWNERSHIP OVER THAT DATA I WANT TO GIVE UP. PRIVACY. S. MAYBE EVEN AGENCY AND THAT IS A DEAL THAT MOST OF US A CAN MAKE I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY PROTECTIVE OF CHILDREN IN THIS AREA. AND WITH CHILDREN I WOULD SAY ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. BECAUSE. MANY. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN DATA GETS MIS USE. I WILL TELL YOU BEING A PROFESSOR IN A TEACHER OF LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE MILLENNIALS IN PARTICULAR. BUT THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS AND THAT THEY ARE VERY VESTED IN A SOLUTION IN FACT I JUST. GOT DONE TEACHING A COURSE OF BUSINESS IN GLOBAL SOCIETY IN WHICH STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO DESIGN ARE A AYE SYSTEMS THAT COULD MAKE SOCIETAL UP PROBLEMS GO AWAY AND MAKE SOCIETAL SYSTEMS MORE. ARE RESILIENT AND ANTI FRAGILE AND. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY MOTIVATED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT WE DO HAVE TO TARGET THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. ARE SO THAT'S A THAT'S A STEP NUMBER FOUR FIVE. I THINK PRIVACY DOES WARRANT SOME POLICY AND REGULATORY APPROACH BUT I WOULD WARN AGAINST. JUST MIMICKING THE EUROPEAN GENERAL DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE. I DO BELIEVE THAT. A MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARE THE INTENT. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TOO BROAD AND IT WILL STIFLE INNOVATION. AND. THE PROBLEM OF COURSE WITH EUROPE IS THAT IT IS VERY PROTECTIVE. AND VERY OF. HAVE SECURE FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT IT LACKS DIGITAL INNOVATION POWER. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE AND WE NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME WE DO NEED TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER WITH THE EUROPEANS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN A BETTER WAY. I I WOULD HIGHLIGHTS HERE THAT GERMANY IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES ARE A STEP AHEAD WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRATION OF LABOR AND DIGITAL TOOLS LIKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS. AND I WOULD URGE US TO STRIKE THE BRIDGE. AND. DEVELOP A JOINT INITIATIVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN JOINTLY FACILITATE LABOR AND WORK IN GENERAL? AS I SAID BEFORE I'M PART OF A BERKELEY INITIATIVE CALLED WORKING LEARNING EARNING. IN THE ERA OF INTELLIGENT TOOLS AND SYSTEMS. WAITS FOR SHORT LONG LONG TITLE. INCOME BUT I THINK VERY MEANINGFUL WORK. BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT THERE THERE IS A NEW ERA DAWNING HERE WHICH IS THAT THE ERA OF THE. LIFETIME JOB. AT THAT KEEPS YOU EMPLOYED FOR FORTY HOURS PLUS A WEEK. IS ESSENTIALLY COMING TO AN END WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT. THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONTRACTING AREA. OUR JOBS ARE GETTING DEFRAGMENTER. BY DIGITAL PLATFORMS SO THEN HOW DO WE HOW DO WE WORK THAT INVOLVEMENT HOW TO LEARN HOW WE ARE. AND CREATE ENOUGH STABILITY SO PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE HAVING FAMILIES ENGAGING IN PARTNERSHIPS BUYING PROPERTY ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT MAKE SOCIETY MORE STABLE AND MORE WORTH WHILE LIVING IN. NOT SO WERE SO. I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD DO SOME INTERNATIONAL ARE PARTNERING AND BEST PRACTICE SHARING THEIR. LASTLY I WOULD MENTION TWO THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS PROCESS PUBLIC. LIKE I SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK WE CAN LEAVE IT TO JUST ENTREPRENEURS AND SCIENTISTS. AND I WORK WITH BOTH AND. THESE A VERY CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS IN FACT AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE SAYS WHEN YOU GO INTO A COMPUTER SCIENCE. TODAY OTHERS ALMOST MORE INTEREST IN A STUDYING OVERALL SOCIAL JUSTICE. THAN THERE IS IN STUDYING HOW TO CODE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE. MOST COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ARE BECOMING VERY AWARE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THEY DON'T WANNA BE PART OF THE PROBLEM THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE CITY. RIGHT. AND SO. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS PUBLIC ENGAGE THE PUBLIC GET THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS. THE. PHILOSOPHERS THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS GET BUSINESS PEOPLE ENTREPRENEURS POLICYMAKERS AND THE MEDIA TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM. I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR A MULTI STAKEHOLDER QUOTE UNQUOTE CONGRESS. WE SORT OF. TENTATIVELY DUBBED IT A CAMBRIAN CONGRESS WHY CAMBRIAN BECAUSE OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION OF LIFE. I AM A TECHNO OPTIMIST I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY DAWNING HERE BUT WE CAN'T HARNESS IT WITHOUT A PUBLIC DIALOGUE SO WE HAVE TO BE PARTICIPATORY. IDEALLY MAYBE IN A STAGE TO EVEN CROSS BORDER. BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT TO HAPPEN IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD COME HERE. AND VICE VERSA. AND THAT KIND OF CONGRESS SHOULD DEVELOP SOME KIND OF. FORUM THAT DISCUSSES A CODE OF CONDUCT. AND THESE WILL NECESSARILY BE VERY HIGH LEVEL RULES. AND THESE WILL BE VOLUNTARY. BUT I THINK PREMIUM. BRAND EQUITY AS IT WERE AND PREMIUM RELATIONSHIP EQUITY WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE CORPORATIONS WHO SIGNED ON TO THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE INTO THIS KIND OF. A CODE OF CONDUCT. THAT LEAVES OUT SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES ON WHAT KIND OF VALUES WE ALL SHARE. WHAT THAT WILL BE WE DON'T KNOW AND THE DIALOGUE WILL SURFACE THAT BUT I THINK JUST HAVING THE DIALOGUE WILL BE IMMENSELY POWERFUL? I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MAYBE WITH THE COMMENT ON EDUCATION. I THINK PART OF MY. COMMENTS ON A. JOBS OF THE FUTURE THINK TANK DASH JOB BROKERING PLATFORM IDEA IS THE THE. THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE THAT WE NEED TO NOW. START TO COACH. FRANKLY ALL OF US BUT MOSTLY. OR MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE THREATENED MORE NEAR TERM. IN A COMBINATION OF HARD AND SOFT SKILLS. SO DATA SIGNS IS PREEMINENTLY IMPORTANT AND I'M A BIG FAN OUT OF OF MAKING THIS. ACHE REQUIREMENTS TO A CALIFORNIA STATE SCHOOLS. AND. AND THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. HOWEVER BASIC CODING SKILLS CAN'T BE THE GOAL. FRANKLY I JUST GOT BACK FROM INDIA AND IN INDIA MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW AFRAID FOR THEIR THIRTY MILLION CODERS. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DEVELOPING MACHINES THAT WILL DO BASIC CODING THEMSELVES. AND SO. SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATED. STANFORD OR BERKELEY PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOWER ELEVEN CORE LOW LEVEL CODING SKILLS IT'S NOT THAT. TODAY'S KIDS SHOULDN'T PUT THEIR HANDS ON THE KEYBOARD TOOK TO LEARN WHAT THAT'S LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO TEACH THEM HOW TO CRITICALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT. DATA SCIENCE DOES. WHETHER IT IS IN FACT REAL SCIENCE. OR WHETHER IT'S JUST ENGINEERING OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CERTAIN INCENTIVES. AND TO DEVELOP CRITICAL THINKING AND ANALYSIS SKILLS WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTING POWER. S. SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN COMBINATION WITH THAT. I WOULD SAY CONVERSELY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS. FRANKLY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA GET ETHICS TRAINING. AND I KNOW THAT MOST OF THEM ALREADY FOR THIS AND THEY WANT IT. BY DE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. ACROSS ACADEMIA SOME OF THE STOVE PIPES AS IN MANY OTHER AREAS IN LIFE DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. SO WE NEED TO GET THE ANTHROPOLOGIST THE PHILOSOPHERS DE ETHICS CALLERS. SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WHAT KIND OF PRINCIPLES DO WE NEED TO TEACH EACH OTHER FOR SOME JOINT UNDERSTANDING. OF THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AND THAT THAT'S ALSO ETHICS DRIVEN OR AT LEAST VALUES DRIVEN WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE THE MORE NEUTRAL TERM. AND SO I THINK IT'S BOTH IT'S HARD AND SOFT ITS STATE OF SCIENCE AND IT'S ETHICS AND IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. THE HUMAN BEING SHOULD NOT BE COMPETING WITH THE COMPUTER SO LET'S NOT JUST TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO BE LIKE A COMPUTER. LET'S TEACH THEM HOW TO INTEGRATE WITH THE COMPUTER HOW TO PARTNER WITH THE COMPUTER BUT HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE COMPUTER. AND PART OF WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT FROM A COMPUTER IS THAT I DO HAVE. THE EMOTING SKILLS THE EMPATHY SKILLS THE IDEATION SKILLS THE IMAGINATION SKILLS THE THE SKILLS TO RELATE BASED ON SHARED HUMAN EXPERIENCE THAT GOES BACK MILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION. THAT MACHINE STONE HALF. AND WE NEED TO FRANKLY ALSO HELP HUMANS AND THESE YOUNG CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR. HOW TO EXERCISE THAT MUSCLE? NOT BE LIKE THE MACHINE TO UNDERSTAND THE MACHINE TO INTERPRET THE MACHINE TO USE THE MACHINE. BUT FRANKLY TO BE THEY HUMAN AND THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND NOT TO BE JUST LIKE ANOTHER MACHINE. AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WE AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HUMAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING HUMAN. RIGHT OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND LAWYERS RUNNING AROUND. AYE AND SO WE WE WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT THIS AND. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T TEACH TRUCK DRIVERS. TO. HAVE A MORE PEOPLE CENTRIC JOB SO FOR THE TIME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING IN THE TRUCK WITH THE HANDS OFF THE WHEEL. OR WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE CUSTOMER SITE. WHEN THEY TAKE THE TRUCK OVER FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. OR WHEN THEY'RE COMMUNICATING IN TRAFFIC MAYBE TAKING OVER TRUCKS AND INNER CITY TRAFFIC. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF UPSCALING WE CAN DO ON JUST THE HUMAN AND SOCIAL SIDE. RIGHT THERE FRANKLY ALL OF US COULD USE A BIT MORE OF. AND SO I THINK I THINK THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN DO THERE. ON THAT SKILL COMBINATION. IF WE WE THINK EDUCATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCHA NEXT SO LET'S GO TO A SERAPH LOCKS WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SARAH FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE REPRESENT TWO MILLION UNION MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY TECHNOLOGY OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN SOME WAY ALREADY. WHETHER IT'S CHANGES FROM. REGULAR PHONES TO CELLPHONES WHETHER IT'S CHANGES IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY WE'VE DEALT WITH THESE KIND OF ISSUES. AND I WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THAT THE PARTICIPANTS HERE TODAY FOR TACKLING SUCH. A HUGE ISSUE. THAT REALLY IS GOING TO TOUCH ALL OF US IN SO MANY WAYS. AND ESPECIALLY IN IN THE WORKPLACE AND AS I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF. MY COMMENTS TODAY ON POLICY ON THE CHALLENGES ON THE OPPORTUNITIES IT SUCH A HUGE TOPIC. AND THE FUTURE. SEEMS VERY UNKNOWN THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF IT WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE A ROBOT APOCALYPSE WAR THERE'S MORE THE TECHNO OPTIMISTS. IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT AND SO. I WAS REALLY STRUCK WHEN MISTER OBERNOLTE RAISE THE ISSUE OF THEIR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT GOING BACK IN HISTORY ACTUALLY HOLD SOME VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR US TODAY. BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WAS A PUBLIC POLICY FAILED. AND WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE THAT. SO THE LUDDITES EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE GOTTEN A BAD RAP AT BEING ANTI TECH TECHNOLOGY WERE NOT THEY WERE SKILLED WEAVERS THEY WERE ARTISANS. THEY HAD GOOD PAYING JOBS AND BEFORE BASICALLY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND WHAT HAPPENED IS GARMENT MAKERS BROUGHT IN THE MACHINE LIAM. WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EQUIVALENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IN AT THAT TIME. AND THIS WAS SOMETHING WHERE THEY COULD BE SILLY DE SKILL THE WORKFORCE AND THE COULD PRODUCE A LOT MORE GOODSA LOT MORE TROUSERS AND MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY. AND PAY OF A LOT LESS AND BASICALLY WHAT THE LUDDITES SIDE IS. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL HOW THE LEAVES ARE USED WE THINK THE LOOMS COULD BE USED TO MAKE US MORE PRODUCTIVE TO MAKE WORK SAFER WE DEPLORE MORE PEOPLE AND SAID THEY THEY SAID WE HAVE CERTAIN DEMANDS. SLOW DOWN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY CONSULT WITH US ASK US WERE SKILLED WORKERS WE MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEAS ON HOW THIS COULD. IT'S TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED BETTER WE NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS WE NEED TO HAVE A SOCIAL SAFETY NET WE NEED TO HAVE A TRANSITION PLAN. WE NEED ALL OF THIS AND SO THEY WENT TO THE EMPLOYERS AND ASKED FOR THIS AND. THE EMPLOYERS BASICALLY SAID NO. WE ARE GOING TO FIRE YOU ALL WERE GOING TO BRING IN LOWER SKILLED WORKERS THEY'RE GONNA BE PAID LAST THEY'RE GONNA WORK FASTER AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT AS GOOD OF A PRODUCT. AND WHEN THEY'RE BASICALLY WASN'T IMPASSE IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS THE LUDDITES FINALLY CAME TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO SMASH THE MACHINES AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CAME IN. AND. BASICALLY PUT DOWN THEIR UPRISING BUT WHAT WAS THE CORE FOR THE LIGHT AIDS WAS THAT THEY WEREN'T ANTI TECHNOLOGY. THEY WANTED TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED. THE WAIT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE WORK FORCE AND THE WAY. THE DISTRIBUTION OF. FRUITS OF THAT THE WAY THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT TECHNOLOGY WERE DISTRIBUTED. MAYBE SO I WANTED TO SHARE OF IT. AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY AND SOCIETY SHOULD HAVE A SHARE OF IT. DOT REBELLION WAS PUT DOWN AND THEN WE MOVED ON TO THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. AND I THINK RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE FACING HUGE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. AND WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHATEVER IT IS IT'S BASICALLY NEUTRAL. IT'S NOT INHERENTLY GOOD ARE INHERENTLY BAD. AND IN FACT AS THE LABOR MOVEMENT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUTOMATION. HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL WE THINK IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO MAKE WORK SAFER TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING TO UP SKILL WORKERS. TO BASICALLY CREATE MORE WORK FOR EVERYBODY. AND TWO FOR THOSE BENEFITS TO ACCRUE TO SOCIETY. UP TO HAVE A BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF THE WEALTH SO WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND INCOME INEQUALITY AND WADE STAGNATION AND THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN THE HANDS OF THE FEW. SO WE THINK THOUGH THAT POTENTIAL IS THERE BUT I REALLY DEPENDS ON DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE NOW. BECAUSE WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE A MISTAKE IS TO STEP BACK AND DO NOTHING AND HAVE TECHNOLOGY BASICALLY RECREATE THE TRENDS WE'RE SEEING NOW WHICH IS TOWARDS GREATER INCOME INEQUALITY. AND CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN THE HANDS OF THE. AND SO WORK ALREADY KIND OF SEEING HIMSELF THAT IN THAT THE WAY TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEPLOYED TODAY I THINK DODD TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GIG ECONOMY. AND HOW AT THE USE OF APPS ARE ARE BASICALLY ALLOWING FOR ARMIES OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO BE DEPLOYED IT MAKES IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSUMER. BUT IN SOME CASES LIKE YOU OF UBER DRIVERS THEIR MAKING THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AN HOUR. YOU OF COURSE HAVE COMPANIES LIKE POST MAY IT'S WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING AND HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE WELL PAID AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM. BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT'S REALLY UP TO EVERY COMPANY TO MAKE THAT THAT DECISION. YOU ALSO SEE IT IN THE USE OF ALGORITHMS. THESE WE'VE SEEN THESE M. TO BE USED IN SCHEDULING YOU MIGHT. YOU KNOW STARBUCKS GIAMBI JUICE WALMART THEY ALL DO THIS JUST IN TIME SCHEDULING WHERE THEY BASICALLY TAKEN ALGORITHMS AND THEY PROGRAM THEM WITH. WET AS CUSTOMER DEMANDS HIGH WHEN'S IT GONNA BE SUNNY SO PEOPLE COME IN FOR THE JOB WOULD USE ONCE AGAIN BE RAINY SO THEY COME IN FOR THEIR LOTS A. AND SO THEY BASICALLY PUT ALL OF THESE. THEORY OF VARIABLES I DON'T OF ATTACK TERM INTO THIS ALGORITHM SO THEY COME UP WITH PERFECT SCHEDULING. BUT THE SCHEDULING IS PERFECT FOR THE COMPANY IT MAKES WORKERS COME MEN FOR THE TWO HOURS WHEN THEIR BUSIEST AND INTO SENDS THEM. THAT'S GREAT FOR THE COMPANY THEY'RE DRIVING DOWN LABOR COSTS BUT IS NOT GREAT FOR THE WORKER WHO HAS TO TRAVEL AN HOUR FOR THEIR TWO HOUR SHIFT AT MINIMUM WAGE. BUT THAT ALGORITHM THAT SAME ALGORITHM COULD BE USED TO SAY OH YOU'RE WORKER YOU OF CHILD CARE YOU'RE ANOTHER WORKER WHO'S TRYING TO HAVE A SECOND JOB YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT THE WAY TO USE THAT ALGORITHM. TO MAKE WORK ACTUALLY BETTER DEBT MAKE SCHEDULES WORK SO THAT YOU KNOW A MOM CAN TAKE CARE FOR CHILDREN OR TAKE A KID TO WORK. ALL OF THAT ALGORITHMS RELIEF IS NEUTRAL IT'S JUST THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE DECIDED TO USE IT. TO BECOME MORE PROFITABLE WHICH IS WHAT THEIR MISSION IS VERSES IN THE INTERESTS OF. THEIR WORKERS. AND SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IS AT THAT POINT WHERE WE NEED POLICYMAKERS TO STEP BEN. AND TO SAY. ALRIGHT. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE DEPLOYED NOT JUST NARROWLY FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF A COMPANY AND THAT'S. WHAT COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO SEE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS? DEPLOYED ON. A BROADER LEVEL FOR THE GOOD OF SOCIETY. AND SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE. IN KIND OF THAT THE MACRO ON MOVING FORWARD AS A RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF POLICY. IS THAT. POLICY MAKERS PULL TOGETHER THE STAKEHOLDERS WHICH INCLUDE PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY ACADEMICS I WOULD SAY REPRESENTATIVES OF WORKERS AND UNIONS CONSUMERS. AND SAY WE NEED TO COME UP WITH. A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. AND THIS FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGIES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED SO AT THE POINT OF DEVELOPMENT SO THAT IT CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY? HOWARD THOSE TECHNOLOGIES GOING TO BE DEPLOYED. HOW ARE WE GOING TO MITIGATE SOME OF THAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THEM? M. AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY THAT MAKES SOCIETY. MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE. VERSES REPLICATING THE INJUSTICES OF THE PAST IN THE JUSTICES UP TODAY. AND TECHNOLOGY I THINK AS A TOOL THAT CAN GET US THERE BECAUSE THERE'S GREAT POTENTIAL BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE. ACTION. AND VERY KIND OF. I THINK PROACTIVE PREEMPTIVE AND BIG ACTION THIS IS A TIME FOR BIG IDEAS BECAUSE. IT'S AS IF WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BUT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND SO WE CAN MAKE CHOICES TO MINIMIZE THE DISRUPTION. AND SO I THINK. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT'S KIND IN THE BROAD FRAME AND I THINK THERE'S THERE'S ROOM TO. TO A JEW ADDRESS A LOT OF ISSUES IN THAT OF COURSE WE'RE PRETTY FOCUSED ON THE WORKPLACE ISSUES. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT TOUCHES. OUR MEMBERS AND MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES AS WELL. BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE ISSUES WITH IN THAT. BECAUSE. WE'RE NOT SEEING. THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE HAPPENING WE'RE SEEING A MUCH MORE KIND OF SUBTLE DEPLOYMENT OF OF TECHNOLOGY WHERE IT WHETHER IT'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. OR WHETHER IT'S THE AUTOMATION OF PARTS OF JOBS OF TASKS WHICH WAS VERY STRIKING IN THE KINSEY REPORT THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE GOT. WAS THAT. STEEP PERCENT OF ALL OCCUPATIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY. WILL HAVE AT LEAST THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR TASKS THAT WILL BE AUTOMATED. WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE A ROBOT THAT COMES AND REPLACES IT IT'S GOING TO BE THE SUBTLE SHIFTS IN THE WORKPLACE. THAT COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UPSCALING. BUT ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DE SKILLED WORKERS TO PAY THEM LAST AND TO REALLY DRIVE DOWN. WAGES AND CONDITIONS SO THE THING THAT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT NET JOB CREATION. LIKE WE AUTOMATED ONE JOB BUT WE CREATED ANOTHER JOB SO THAT'S FINE WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF JOBS. WE SEE THIS WHEN YOU. GET RID OF A UPS TRACKING DR JOB OR YOU GET RID OF IT AUTOMATES II TRUCKERS JOB AND THEN THE GO BE AN AMAZON GIVE WORKER. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A GOOD UNION JOB AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S A LOW WAGE TEMPORARY PART TIME SEASONAL JOB WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD OUR MIDDLE CLASS WITH THAT'S WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO JOB QUALITY. AND NOT JUST JOB CREATION. THAT'S A BIG PIECE. THE SAFETY NET I DON'T KNOW MISS PART IS I DON'T OF THE SAFETY NET HAS BEEN. ADDRESSED. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND PORTABLE BENEFITS. I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A SAFETY NET IT'S DESIGNED FOR WHEN PEOPLEARE OUT OF WORK IT IS ALREADY FRAYING AND IT IS ALREADY UNDER ATTACK. BASICALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY NET WE ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR IT AND WHO'S GONNA MAKE SURE IT'S IN THERE. AND SO WITH UNIVERSAL BASIC IN INCOME IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND IT. AND HOW WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS PEOPLE TRANSITION TO WORK BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS VALUE IN WORK AND THERE'S DIGNITY AND WORK. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE. AND RICH RETRAINING I THINK PROFESSOR BROUGHT ME GREAT POINTS IT'S WE NEED TO HAVE A JOB MATCHING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S ANY TRAINING OR RETRAINING WERE PUTTING PEOPLE INTO A JOB AND WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE INTO A HIGH QUALITY JOB. YOU NOT GONNA TAKE A UNION TRUCK DRIVER A UNION. A CHECKER AT A SUPERMARKET A UNION GRIP ON A ON A. YOU KNOW A FILM SAT. AND SAY. OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU INTO BEING A DISHWASHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT. IT'S NOT HELPING WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH SO THAT I THINK IS IT A BIG PIECES WELL AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN IN YOUR PROGRAM. WORK WISH WHICH YES YES IT'S VERY SIMILAR ARGUE WITH INDIFFERENCE TO PROGRAMS WE HAVE EARN WHILE YOU LEARN. I THINK THE SAME THING IS IS REALLY POSSIBLE HEARING TECHNOLOGY I THINK ENABLES THAT AND SO THAT WILL BE A BIG A BIG PIECE OF IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE VERY AWARE OF THAT TRANSITION. AND THEN I'M ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT I BECOME TAKE A LESSON FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE. A CREW AND ACTIVISTS IS ADOPTION HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADAPT AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME REALLY BIG IDEAS M. BECAUSE. WE MAY HAVE A POINT WHERE TECHNOLOGY BEASTLY SAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FEWER JOBS. WE JUST. IT MAY HAPPEN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED FEWER WORKERS. THAT IF WE LOOK AT JOBS AND TASKS AS SEPARATE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUR MEMBERS AND WHO ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEM. THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT AND WE HAVE EXAMPLES AND ONE IS. YOU KNOW THE WORK WEEK THAN KINSEY STUDY ALSO SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN SINCE NINETEEN HUNDRED THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY PERCENT DECREASE IN THE HOURS THAT WORKERS WORK. I LIKE TO SAY THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT WE BROUGHT YOU THE WEEKEND. YOU'RE WELCOME AND THE FORTY HOUR WEEK BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR US TO SAY. MAYBE NOW WE NEED TO GO TO A TWENTY EIGHT HOUR WEEK. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WORKERS WORK FEWER HOURS. FOR THE SAME WAGE WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE MORE HOURS AVAILABLE FOR MORE WORKERS. SO WE'RE PUTTING MORE PEOPLE TO WORK. AT THE SAME WAGES BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING FEWER HOURS. AND. WERE ABLE THAT IS ONE WAY TO SHARE THE BENEFITS IN THIS IS. MADE SOME OF THE BIG CRAZY BUT IN GERMANY. THERE WAS A UNION THAT JUST NEGOTIATED THIS IT'S GONNA BE BASICALLY AFFECT FOUR MILLION GERMAN WORKERS. IT'S A STEEL COMPANY AND THEY'VE NEGOTIATED A TWENTY EIGHT HOUR WORK WEEK. AT SIMILAR WAGES AND THEY'VE DONE THIS FOR OTHER REASONS BUT ONE OF IT WAS TO ADAPT TO WHAT IS SEEN AS A MORE FLEXIBLE. WORK FORCE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ENDING THAT THAT KIND OF TRADITIONAL MODEL WHERE PEOPLE STAY AT A JOB FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IN THERE'S MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALL OF THAT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT HAS TO BE A GIG ECONOMY. WE CAN MAKE THESE BE GOOD JOBS THAT ARE GOOD JOBS FOR MORE PEOPLE. WITHOUT HAVING TO LOWER JOB QUALITY SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE. TECHNOLOGY IS A TOOL IT'S A TOOL THAT IT IS IN OUR HANDS THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER FUTURE WITH. AND I THINK THIS COMMITTEE FOR STARTING THIS THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NEXT LET'S GO TO A SUMMIT ACCORDING. WELCOME. CHAIR MEMBERS. MAMIE SMITH THE CORBIN I REPRESENT AS YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF CLIENTS IN THE CONSUMER PRIVACY AND PROTECTION SPACE INCLUDING ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE AND. COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION AND AND WHAT'S COMPELLING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT IS. MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ME THERE'S NOT ONE AREA WHERE A AYE DOESN'T. HAVE SOME SORT OF IMPLICATION WHERE IT DOESN'T TOUCH ALL ON ONE OF THE ISSUE AREAS FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. THE ABILITY OF A AYE SYSTEMS TO TAKE JUST A BIG U. S. VAST AMOUNTS OF DATA AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO SOMETHING INSIGHTFUL TO TAKE THEM AND TURN THEM INTO KNOWLEDGE AND TO DRIVE SOLUTIONS IS. SIGNIFICANT IT'S WERE REALLY AT AN UNSURPASSED MOMENT IN HISTORY. THEY CAN BE USED TO TREAT DISEASETHE STATIC CAN BE USED PREDICT THE WEATHER TO MANAGE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY TO MISS FLOCKS POINT. AND LIKE ALL OF THE POWERFUL TOOLS OUT THERE. GREAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT DEPLOYMENT AND REGULATION OF A AYE AND SIMILARLY INNOVATIVE TOOLS. CITADELLE SPEAK FIRST ABOUT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL HARMS AND THAT THAT COULD EXIST IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR AREAS WHERE. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY MIGHT CONSIDER PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTIONS. ALREADY CONSUMERS INTERACT WITH A AYE ON A. DAILY BASIS. CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR. DISS A LITTLE BIT TROUBLESOME AND AND THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE CUSTOMER SERVERS HUMAN RESOURCES COUNSELING FUNCTIONS ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE BEING FARMED OUT TO A AYE ASSISTANCE AND BOX. SOME OF THESE INTERFACES ARE ONLY TO BECOME MORE POPULAR IN ESSENTIAL AREAS LIKE EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE ON WHERE YOU HAVE EVEN MORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING COLLECTED. AND AND ALL ALONG THE WAY SHIFTING THE LANDSCAPE OF LABOR MARKET IN HUMAN INTERACTIONS. AND PEOPLE TO LET THEIR GUARD DOWN WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ONLINE EVEN MORE SO WHEN THEY'RE TALKING TO BOTS OR A AYE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SOME OF THESE ARE EVEN DESIGNED TO HEAR AND RESPOND TO A CONSUMERS. AT INNER MOST SECRETS. WHICH PEOPLE OFTEN DO SHARE YET THE SYSTEMS ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO DECLARE THEIR NON HUMAN NATURE AND UNDER FEWER OBLIGATIONS NOT TO USE THIS INTIMATE INSIGHT GLEANED FROM THESE COMMUNICATIONS FOR OTHER PURPOSES. IT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME. EARLIER MISTER GROWTH SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE DEGREE OF INTIMACY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND TECHNOLOGY AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY AS A RESULT OF THAT BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED WITH THE INCREASING USE OF A AYE. SO THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE AGGREGATED THE DEGREE OF INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL BE KNOWN ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THIS LIFE PATTERN DATA. IS IN MANY WAYS ON PROTECTED BY OUTDATED EXISTING LAWS REGARDING PRIVACY SECURITY AND EVEN HUMAN RESEARCH. THIS RAISES A VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS INTIMATE DATA MIGHT BE USED BY CORPORATIONS OR GOVERNMENTS WHAT PROTECTIONS DO EXIST WHAT SHOULD EXIST AND WHAT RIGHTS INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HOP TO THEIR OWN INFORMATION. MR GROWTH ALSO MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING STATEMENTS THAT MUCH OF THE CONCERN ABOUT SORT OF THE SUPER HUMAN POWER OF A AYE THAT IS THEORIZED IN HOLLYWOOD. IS LIKELY DECADES AWAY HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT CHINA IS THE BIG KID ON THE BLOCK. AND YOU KNOW THERE ACCORDING TO A RECENT ARTICLE IN SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE PLANS TO USE DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS SO THAT THE STATE CAN DEVELOP A CITIZENS SCORE. SO IN ESSENCE TAKING THE ONLINE ACTIVITIES OF CITIZENS OF CHINA TO DETERMINE THEIR LOYALTY THEIR COMPLIANCE TO. THE STATE FLAWS IN TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THEIR. LENT ABILITY AND WHETHER THEY'RE SUITABLE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE SO IF YOUR FANS OF THE SHOW BLACK MIRROR YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN A PARTICULAR EPISODE. AND IT'S ACTUALLY USE IN THE REAL WORLD AND QUICKLY REALIZE THAT NOT ALL THE VARIOUS USES OF A GUY ARE THAT FAR OFF IN THE MINDS OF HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS. I AM WHEN YOU COUPLE THE CONSTANT MONITORING NOW POSSIBLE THROUGH THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND WITH OTHER SORT OF ADDICTIVE AND BEHAVIOR ALTERING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLAY. SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S OPINIONS AND BEHAVIOR AND THESE ARE FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES RIGHT NOW. THE RESULTING SYSTEM IS ONE THAT TENDS TOWARDS COMPLETE CONTROL AND PUTS THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF INDIVIDUALS AT RISK. ADVANCES IN COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS NEUROSCIENCE AGGRESSIVE DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES ALL OF THESE COUPLED WITH A AYE TOOLS OR COMPONENTS FOR SYSTEMS THAT CAN. TRULY CHANGE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS THE WAY THEY BEHAVE. NOT ONLY IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES BUT IN ELECTIONS AS WELL. AND THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER EXISTING LAWS REGARDING THINGS LIKE TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AND AVOIDING DECEPTIVE OR UNFAIR ADVERTISING PRACTICES. FALL SHORT IN ADDRESSING THE TYPES OF COMPLEX ALGORITHMS AND STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING USED. TO DRIVE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND INTERACTIONS SO THEN WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT HOPE DO UNINFORMED CONSUMERS HAVE IN RESISTING CAREFULLY TARGETED DIGITAL MESSAGING THAT USES TRIGGERING WORDS INTENTIONALLY TO INFLUENCE THEIR JUDGMENT AND BEHAVIORS. MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF PRIVACY BY DESIGN. IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY ONE WE'VE ADVOCATED FOR HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND IT'S A FORM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND WHICH. PRIVACY IS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING PROF. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S CALLED A VALUE SENSITIVE DESIGNS SO IT MEANS THAT HUMAN VALUES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THROUGH THE ENTIRE DESIGN PROCESS AND IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT CONCEPT OF VALUE SENSITIVE DESIGN. AS WERE THINKING ABOUT REGULATING A AYE AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES. I'M. I'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE ABOUT THE CODE OF FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE FIPS WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BY OUR OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE SEVENTIES. THAT RECOGNIZE THE VAST IMPLICATIONS THAT DATA COLLECTION CAN HAVE ON INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY SECURITY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND THE STATE A FEW THINGS PERSONAL DATA. RECORD KEEPING SYSTEMS WHOSE EXISTENCE IS KEPT SECRET SHOULD NOT EXIST ARE THERE SHOULD BE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT THEN IS RECORDED AND HOW IT'S USED. THERE SHOULD BE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO PREVENT INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT WAS OBTAINED FOR ONE PURPOSE FROM BEING USED FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON PURPOSE EXCUSE ME WITHOUT THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN SENT. OUT THERE MUST BE A WAY FOR A PERSON TO CORRECT ERRONEOUS OR INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES. AND AND THEN ANY ORGANIZATION CREATING MAINTAINING. USING DISSEMINATING RECORDS OF IDENTIFIABLE PERSONAL DATA THAT SHOULD ASSURE THE RELIABILITY OF THAT DATA FOR ITS INTENDED USE AND TAKE. CAUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST MISUSE. I'M AS DATA BECOMES INCREASINGLY PROLIFIC AND AFFORDABLE FOR COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES AND TYPES TO COLLECT AN AGGREGATE THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. YET IN MANY CASES THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY SLOW TO CATCH UP EVEN ON. ENSURING THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE FOR CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES SO FAR AS LEGISLATION IS CONCERNED WERE WAY BEHIND AND WRAPPING HER ARMS AROUND THIS IN FACT MOST RECENTLY. WE'VE SEEN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY REPEAL EXISTING CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THROUGH BROADBAND PRIVACY AND AND THAT NEUTRALITY MOST RECENTLY WERE ACTUALLY GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND SO BY FAILING TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE CREATION OF REALLY SIGNIFICANT LONGITUDINAL OVER LIFETIME PATTERNS OF THE EVA. WITHOUT THE CONSENT OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE OF CONSUMERS. WE PUT OURSELVES IN A VERY CHALLENGING AND POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL SITUATION AND AS A AYE BECOMES MORE FREQUENTLY USED. TO DRIVE DECISION MAKING. AND I'M. SO. THAT SAID IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IBM READ A WHITE PAPER ON THE SUBJECT TO WHICH THEY SIDE. TO GREAT WHITE PAPER AND SEND IT TO. BREAK TO SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF A AYE SYSTEMS WE WILL FIRST NEED TO TRUST IT. BUT THAT BUILDING TRUST ALSO REQUIRES A SYSTEM OF BEST PRACTICES THAT CAN HELP GUIDE THE THIEF AN ETHICAL MANAGEMENT OF A AYE SYSTEMS INCLUDING ALIGNMENT WITH SOCIAL NORMS AND VALUES. ALGORITHMIC RESPONSIBILITY. COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LEGISLATION AND POLICY ASSURANCE OF INTEGRITY OF DATA ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND ON THIS SUBJECT EIGHT I ACTUALLY AGREE VERY MUCH WITH IBM I'M SO WITHOUT SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN POLICY MAKING THAT GO BEYOND JUST WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS AND ENTREPRENEURS. AND COULD POTENTIALLY ENSURE THAT AS POLICY MAKERS YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE ELECTED TO DO WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS. FIRST CONSIDER UPDATING PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION IN LIGHT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH EASILY DIGESTIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT. IS COLLECTED ABOUT THEM HOW IT'S USED AYE AND THEIR RIGHTS TO PROTECT THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE. REQUIRE CLEAR CONSPICUOUS AND EASILY DIGESTIBLE DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW AND WHEN A I USE USE TO COMMUNICATE AND INTERACT WITH THEM. IN SHORT PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR TRUTH IN ADVERTISING INCLUDING POLITICAL ADVERTISING THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BEHAVIOUR ALTERING NATURE OF A AYE SYSTEMS COUPLED WITH NUDGING TECHNOLOGIES REDUCE. ETHICS BY DESIGN. ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES DO NOT KNOWINGLY ENGAGE IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO SOCIETY AND ENSURING THAT THE SAME STANDARDS OF ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT ALSO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A AYE SYSTEMS. I'M COMPANIES SHOULD HAVE IN PLACE GUIDELINES THAT GOVERN THE ETHICAL MANAGEMENT OF THEIR OPERATIONS. AND SYSTEMS THAT ENSURE COMPLIANCE. I KNOW I GET NEXT ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND A AYE ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEM SO THAT MEANS AT A MINIMUM THAT THE ALGORITHMS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE SYSTEMS SHOULD BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. WHICH MEANS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THEIR BEHAVIOR TO PEOPLE IN TERMS THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. ABOUT WHAT THEY DO HOW AND WHY SO HOW DO THEY INTERPRET AN INPUT WHY DID THEY RECOMMEND A PARTICULAR ALPINE. AND WITH THIS TRANSPARENCY WE CAN CROWD SOURCED SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND. POTENTIAL BIAS IN SYSTEMS SO THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN AND BE BETTER THAN THE MACHINE TO BE BETTER PEOPLE AND TO LEVERAGE THESE TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF BEING LEVERAGED. BY THE TECHNOLOGY. CONSIDER REQUIRING APPROPRIATE VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION TESTING PRIOR TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF A AYE TECHNOLOGIES THIS IS VERY SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OF IN TERMS OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY. FOR I OR T. AND OTHER DEVICES THE IDEA THAT BEFORE YOU JUST RELEASE THESE DEVICES AND THE SYSTEMS ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND IN ESSENCE BE TO TASK ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME ASSURANCES THAT THEY'VE UNDERGONE PROPER VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION TESTING. AND WHEN THE SYSTEMS DO FAIL WHO'S LIABLE FOR THAT I HAVE WHEN THERE IS HARM AND AND HOW WOULD WE EVEN KNOWING SO JUST SOME QUESTIONS TO PONDER AND THEN. FINALLY AND THIS IS A POINT THAT THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO SOME DEGREE BUT I THINK WORTH CAMP PUNCTUATING. MY COMMENTS WITH IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR CHILDREN WERE LITERALLY BETA TESTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THEM. AND THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADDICTIVE. BUT NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTING PEOPLE TOWARDS SUBSTANCE THAT IS A QUALITY AND BUT JUST QUANTITY STAY ON THE PLATFORM STAY ON THE PLATFORM. AND STUDIES SHOW THAT KIDS ARE. INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS WHEN THEIR SMARTPHONES ARE TAKEN AWAY THAT THERE'S POTENTIALLY DAMAGE I THAT CAN OCCUR IN TERMS OF THE GRAY MATTER IN THEIR BRAINS. POTENTIALLY DAMAGE RELATED TO. OBESITY SLEEPLESSNESS ANXIETY FEELINGS OF WORTHLESSNESS THESE ARE ALL THINGS FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH RESEARCH. AND YET ONCE AGAIN BE IT FROM PUSH AND NUDGING TECHNOLOGIES TO CONCERT SMARTPHONE USE I THINK THE MOST RECENT START I SAW WAS THAT WE TOUCH OUR FUNDS ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND TIMES A DAY. IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO EDUCATE KIDS AND PROVIDE CURRICULUM AROUND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY PUT SOME BOUNDARIES AROUND WHAT KIDS HAVE BEFORE THEM IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. AND HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH THEM BECAUSE NO AMOUNT OF TEACHING A NOMADIC CURRICULUM CAN GET IN FRONT OF THREE THOUSAND TOUCHES THE DAY THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY KEEP YOU COMING BACK. SO I WOULD I WOULD PUNCTUATE THAT IT FOR BOTH THIS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OF FINALLY LETS GO TO A MISTER DINO ROW WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LITIGATION WITH ADOBE. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU TURNS OUT AND I MEMBERS COMMITTEE. I HAVE KEPT HEANEY SPEAK. I KNOW THAT IN A IN A MINUTE HER. SECONDS MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE TIME. SHOW YOU SOME MY I WOULD SAY POSITIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE USING A AYE IN OUR PRODUCTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. MAYBE RE ESTABLISH THE VALUE OF A AYE AND IT'S IT'S BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. AND SUSAN HOW ADOBE USES A ITES CRITICAL TO ADOBE. I'M YOU KNOW DOUBLE FROM PHOTOSHOP AN ACROBAT AND. ILLUSTRATOR AND THESE ARE TOOLS THAT PROFESSIONAL USE EVERYDAY TO DO THEIR JOB. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A AYE WE WANT TO TALK AT W. ONCE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS HELPS THEM DO THEIR JOB BETTER. IN A IN A POSITIVE WAY SO WE WE LOOK AT IT AS. HEARTS YOU LEADING HERE BUT WE HAVE TO SORT OF BUSINESSES THAT WE FOCUS ON CREATIVITY WHICH IS YOUR PHOTO SHOP. AND EXPERIENCES WHICH IS. BOY WE ARE ANALYTICS BUSINESS WE PROVIDE. SERVICES DAY RETAILERS AND E. TAILERS TO ANALYZE THE BILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS I COME ACROSS WEBSITE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS IS OF THE TWO BUSINESSES THAT WERE. SORT OF FOCUSING ON BOTH OF THEM YOU SAY I. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS THAT A TECHNOLOGY IN IN IN OUR PLAYERS ADVOCATE OF CLOUD PRODUCT. OF YOUR CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL RIGHT NOW AND YOU HAVE A MARKETING CAMPAIGN INSOMUCH AS I WON CITY SCAPE YOU GO OUT YOU SET YOUR CAMERA YOU TAKE THIS PICTURE. IS BEAUTIFUL YOU COME BACK TO THE MARKETING CLIENT AND THEY SAY WHAT'S GREAT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SUNSET. SORRY GO OFTEN RE SHOOTING SO YOU HAVE TO GO OFTEN RESHOOT IT AND THAT TAKES NOTED THEY TWO DAYS WEEKS WHATEVER IT IS TO GET THE SENSE THAT. WE CAN DO WITH WITH. OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE MILLIONS OF PICTURES IS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT A SENSE THAT IS YOU KNOW MORE YOU GET THAT WORD FROM THE PROFESSIONAL? WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS WE CAN GIVE YOU THIS PICTURE YOUR ORIGINAL PICTURE. HAD A SUNSET AND DOESN'T JUST PUT THIS GUY ON IT THAT'S THE COLORS THE ENTIRE. BUILDING SIT IN IN JEST. IN JUST TEN SECONDS TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL CAN RESPOND TO THE MARKETING CLIENTS. REQUEST AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT. I'M SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF. DRUDGERY OUT OF YOUR JOB IF YAKKING JUST WANTED TRYING TO THIS IN PHOTOSHOP IT WOULD TAKE YOU WEEKS IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO RESHOOT IT. SOME AND THIS MAY BE ON LOCATION WE HAVE TO FLY BACK ON OCCASION THIS ENABLES PRODUCTIVITY THIS THE EFFICIENCY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW YOU MAY HAVE A VERY FINICKY MARKETING PERSON THEY SAY YOU KNOW I. NEVER MY WE WANTED SOMETHING SNOW WE'RE SNOWBLOWER AND THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND THEN THEY SAY OKAY WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN JUST TAKE THIS PICTURE. USE OUR A AYE AND WE CAN GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND IT'S STILL THE SAME PICTURE YOU CAN TURN THIS AROUND IN MINUTES NOT WEEKS. AND IT'S STILL TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL THE PERSON DESIGNING THE PICTURE WHOSE HAS THE CONTROL OF THIS. THEY'RE STILL USING THEIR SKILL THEY'RE STILL USING THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR JOB JUST GOT A LOT EASIER AND THE MARKETING CALPINE HE'S HAPPIER TO. THEY GET THEIR JOB TURNED AROUND MUCH FASTER. THIS ALSO WORKS PURSE FOR A FOR A CONSUMER PRODUCTS YOU MAY HAVE A FIX YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY SAY I WANT TO LOOK LIKE MANGO. AND WE HAVE THIS. THIS A AYE THE UNDERSTAND STYLE AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING IS THINK ABOUT A AYE AYES THE VALUE IT GIVES YOU IS NOT JUST IT I WANT MORE READ. IT CAN THINK ABSTRACT CONCEPTS LIKE STYLE AND SIT IN THE STYLE OF MANGO I WANT MY HOUSE I WANT MY HOUSE TO LOOK LIKE THIS. AS YOU CAN APPLY THAT. STYLE TO. I A NORMAL PICTURE JUST THE REGULAR CONSUMER USING OUR PRODUCTS AND THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FROM MAY AYE UNDERSTANDING WHAT STYLE IS RUNNING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DATA. POINTS INTO OUR SYSTEM DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINTINGS. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT STYLE IS. THAT LAST EXAMPLE ON THE CREATIVE SIDE. SO IT'S KIND. AND SO THE OTHER. THE THING WE CAN DO IS WE CAN TALK ABOUT. I MOTIONS. AND SO WE WE SHOW YOU A PICTURE YOU MAY HAVE A PICTURE. OF YOUR KIDS ANDERSON THEY SEEM HAPPY AND YOU HAVE DOZENS OF THOSE AND MAYBE HAVE EVEN MORE OF THEM WERE CRYING. AND YOU MAY SAY I WANT ALL THE HAPPY ONES I'M A I CAN CAN BE TRAINED UNDERSTAND EMOTION I CAN TAKE A CONCEPT LIKE HAPPY. AND BRING BACK A SET OF HAPPY PICTURES WE CAN EVEN EARLY IN THE PROTOTYPE IN OUR LIVES RIGHT NOW WE'VE A SLIDER. WE GOT THE GLOOMY SLIDER AND OF THE AND YOU SLIDE ALL THE RIGHT AND YOU GET BACK ALL THE GLOOM USE PICTURES AND UNDERSTANDS A GLOOMY IS INSIDE ALL MALE LEFT IS ALL THE FROM THE BRAKES GUYS AND BEACH SCENES RIGHTS HAPPY RIGHT. AND YOU JUST MOVE THE SLIDER BACK AND FORTH AND YOU CAN IT CAN UNDERSTAND THE EMOTION. THAT YOU'RE SEEKING THAT THAT'S THE MAGIC OF WHAT A IDEAS. ON THAT EXPERIENCE SIDE JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. WHAT WE DO WHAT WE USE IT FOR HERE NOT AS NOT AS I SEXY UNFORTUNATELY? IS WE ALLOW. ME SEIZE OR COALS OF WHEREAS AN ONLINE SAY WE CAN PREDICT WHAT THE COST WHAT A CUSTOMER WHO'S IN RIGHT TO THE WEBSITE. IS GOING TO DO ONE WEBSITE ARE THEY GOING TO BY THE NECK AND THE BY THEY IN A BROWSER THAT CAN COME BACK AND WE CAN THEN LET YOU TARGET YOUR EXPERIENCE FOR ME SEIZE. SOMETHING TO THAT PERSON BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS. OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COME BEFORE AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THAT WE GENERALIZE THAT CONCEPT AS WE KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE BEFOREHAND. WE CAN ALSO ANALYZE YOUR UP TO PEAS IN THIS IS JUST THIS ATTY GOES FOR GOVERNMENTS AS WELL WE CAN TELL YOU. YOU KNOW BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE DATA YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE WEB PAGE GONNA DRIVE CUSTOMER PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT'S CONFUSING OR PARTICULATE. DRIVE EMAIL SIGN UPS BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE PART IS MOST ATTRACTIVE TO JUST DO THE ANALYSIS OF THIS DATA WERE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SERVICES. AND YOU COULD NEVER EVEN HAVE BEFORE AND WOULD ALSO TAKE THE REGULAR PROFESSIONAL. HOURS AND HOURS SO THIS IS SIR WHAT ADOBE'S DOING. IN IN TERMS OF IT'S A AYE AND I'M IN A LOT OF COMPANIES LIKE US AND SO USING A AYE TO. TO TO ASSIST THE PROFESSION ON SO WHEN I AYE HERE SO I'LL OBVIOUSLY IS LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT. JOB LOSS BUT THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT JOB ENHANCEMENT IS A LOT OF EVERYONE'S JOB RIGHT NOW THAT'S FAIRLY TEDIOUS IN ROUTINE AND WE CAN TAKE THAT AWAY A I CAN TAKE THAT AWAY. A AYE WORKS BEST WHEN THERE'S MILLIONS OF. VERY SIMILAR DATA THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR. SERVE UNIQUE THINGS THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY SO THE IDEA OF THE A I JUST AN HOUR IS JUST CAN REPLACE WHAT. A REGULAR PROFESSIONAL IS DOING. OR SOMETHING THAT IS SOPHISTICATED REQUIRES HUMAN INSIGHT IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY NOT POSSIBLE AND THEY NEED REPETITIVE DATA. TO UNDERSTAND AND GENERALIZE WHAT IS GOING ON AND SO. ADOBE AND AND AND OTHER COUNTRIES THE IN THE TECH INDUSTRY WE LOOK AT THIS AS A AS AS AS A WAY TO. TO EVEN LOWER BARRIERS OF ENTRY SO SO MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE MOST CREATIVE PERSON IN THE WORLD. BUT BECAUSE WE'VE MADE OUR TOOLS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF CREATING AD CAMPAIGNS THAT MAYBE THEY COULDN'T BEFORE. THERE'S ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOWER THE BARRIER TO ENTRY DID SOME THE MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER TOOLS AND ALLOW. THESE JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY MAYBE NEED A MASTER'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HOW TO CREATE THESE DATA CAMPAIGNS ANYMORE IF YOU AUTOMATE THE MOST TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT PART OF IT SO I. I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS IS POSITIVE PART OF THIS THERE'S THERE'S. THE THE PROGRESS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. IS GOING TO CREATE MORE IN MY OPINION MORE JOBS THAN WE WERE GOING TO LOSE AND. WHEN WE LOOK BACK A YEAR PRE INTERNET AND WE LOOK BACK PRE SMARTPHONE YOU IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE HOW IT CHANGED OUR LIVES IN THE OBVIOUS USE HIM NEGATIVE THINGS. BUT JUST SO MANY MORE POSITIVE THINGS THE REASON WHY SOMEONE TOUCHES UPON THREE THOUSAND TIMES A DAY. THERE SOME POSITIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND I'M A AYE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK BACK WE'RE GONNA WONDER HOW WE GET ALONG WITH. ME HE'S GONNA MAKE EVERYONE'S LIVES IN CERTAIN WAYS SO MUCH BETTER AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS PUSHING THEM BACK IN CLEAN AROUND MAKES NO SENSE TO ME RIGHT. THERE'S EXAM YOU SO MUCH THAT WE VALUE WE GET OF THIS AND SO WE WHAT I WANT TO CAUTION AGAINST. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO AND I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS WE CAN DO HERE. THIS THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO OTHER STATES OF TRIED TO DO. BUT THERE'S ALSO I WANT THROUGHOUT THE CAUTION THAT WE WERE BURNED EARLY DAYS AND. NONE OF US KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO AND OR WERE THE STUFF FOR SHOWING YOU SOME THAT STEPS IN OUR PRODUCTS SOME OF THAT'S. JUST PROTOTYPES. MOST OF THE THINGS I'VE HERE PEOPLE CAN BE CONCERNED ABOUT WERE STILL YEARS AND YEARS OUR WAY OF SEEING US EVEN VIABLE. AND SO. I I WOULDN'T WANT TO. START CREATING POLICY NOW THAT SORT OF CRASHES POTENTIAL THAT WE HAVE. THERE'S GIVE ME PLENTY OF TIME TO SIR WATCHED AS THIS GOES AND SAY OKAY THIS. THIS THIS IS PROBABLY TOO FAR WE MAKE THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN AND AND REGULATE THIS ASPECT. BUT I'M BORED I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET I I REALLY MY CAUTION IS LET'S NOT. LET'S NOT I'M LET'S NOT STEP TOO FAR. THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT SOME QUESTIONS ARMED BIAS OR A AND DISCRIMINATION AND THAT'S A CONCERN OF THE W. WE HAVE A COUNCIL ADOBE THAT'S FOCUSED ON DATA ETHICS. AND AND. LIKE OTHER TECH COMPANIES AND SAID THIS GROUP IS IS ANALYZE IT WHERE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR DESIGNING A AYE HOW DO WE ELIMINATE BIAS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEARCH WE HAVE A STOCK PHOTOGRAPHY SITE. WE SEARCH FOR LAWYER ARE YOU ONLY GONNA CAUCASIAN MALES BACK ARE YOU GETTING DIVERSITY RIGHT. KEY TO THAT. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE KEY TO A AYE BEING NOW I'M. BEING UNBIASED AND NON DISCRIMINATORY. IS DATA. THE MORE DATA WE HAVE THE MORE MUTUAL THE A I WILL BE SO WHEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT THINKS ABOUT REGULATION ON DATA. IF WE'RE. MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET DATA. THEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT A AYE SYSTEMS WILL BE BY. TO THE BEST THING WE CAN DO TO MAKE A AYE AYES UNBIASED USED ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GET TRAINED ON THE BROADEST. SET OF DATA THAT THERE'S THAT'S OUT THERE SO WHEN I WINDOW BE GOES AND LOOKS AT DATA WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE'RE LOOKING FOR LIKE THE COLOR THE SKY THE COLOR YOUR HAIR. SIZE YOUR NOSE TO STRUCTURE THEIR DOCUMENT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PDF ACROBAT PRODUCT RIGHT THE STRUCTURING OR THE PARAGRAPHS UNDER TITLES LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ASPECTS OF IT. WE REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PRIVACY DISCUSSION TO BE HAD. BUT WERE TALKING MY A I SPECIFICALLY AND AND AND AND MAY BE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING. THE A I NEEDS TO GENERAL INFORMATION WE NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF INFORMATION AS GENERAL WE JUST WEEK. KNOWING WHO YOU ARE IS IRRELEVANT TO TRAINING A AYE. UNLESS I WAS TRYING TO TRINITY I TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU WERE IN WHICH CASE IS VERY RELEVANT RIGHT. AND I SAY THAT I SAY THAT IS A JOKE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU OFFER A LOT OF THE BAD EXAMPLES OF OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION AND AND AND AND STATE MAYBE. STATE OVERREGULATION. THIS MAY BE SHOCKING EVER IN HERE BUT THAT ALREADY EXIST TODAY RIGHT ON THE BLACK WOMAN GETTING STOPPED BY THE POLICE. ALREADY HAPPENS TODAY RIGHT THE DISCRIMINATION IN THE BIAS THAT EXISTS TODAY IT IN AN A. EYES IS IS A RESULT OF SYSTEMIC BIAS THAT'S ALREADY PRESENT RIGHT. THAT IF A HOUSING OFFICIAL CREATING A AYE AND SAYS I'M ONLY GONNA GIVE OUT LOANS TO CERTAIN PEOPLE'S RACE BECAUSE OF THEIR PROFILE. AND THAT YEAH I LEARNED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DATA IT WAS FIVE. RIGHT AND SO. WE NEED THAT MEANS REALLY SMART ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONS WEB DISCRIMINATION MATTERS ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATE'S. AND WE ALREADY ARE. AWARE OF THAT WE ARE TO HAVE LAWS. IN THOSE INDUSTRIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT DISCRIMINATION NAKED DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECT SOMEONE TRYING TO GET A LOAN TRYING TO RENT A HOUSE. AND SO THE PLACES WHERE WE'VE ALREADY FELT THE NEED TO REGULATE ARE PROBABLY PLACES WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA SAID STARTING TRAINED. EYES THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS ARE DIVERSE YOU MAY HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE SCALE AND SAY LET'S MAKE SURE WE OVER CORRECT HERE BECAUSE IF YOU JUST TAKE THE REGULAR DATA WE MEAN UP WITH BIAS RESULTS. BUT I THINK WE ARE DO YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE IT'S NOT EVERY INDUSTRY. IF THIS IF CHINA WANTS TO GO AHEAD AND AND MINOR ITS PEOPLE IT'S ALREADY MONITORING ITS PEOPLE. IT'S ALREADY DOING THAT RIGHT NOW A EYES A TOOL IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER AT IT. BUT AGAIN A EYES TO TOOL. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP CHINA FROM MONITORING ITS PEOPLE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IN AND AND HAVE THESE PROFILES RIGHT SO AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS THE MOTIVATION OF THE ACTOR. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MOTIVATION THE ACCURATE WE HAVE ALL THIS TIME AND AS WITH THE OTHER IS IN PLACE AND VERY MAJOR ROLE BECAUSE THE D. BIASES COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE OF THE THE WAY THAT THE ALGORITHM IS. CONSTRUCTED OR A BEING WRITTEN RIGHT IS IN THAT PART OF THE. EQUATION AS WELL RIGHT AND I THINK I'M JUST A OUTSIDE OF ELECTRONS IN YOUR UNDERGRAD AND. CAN A PATENT LAWYER WITH LAW SCHOOL ANYWAY. SO THERE'S NO ALGORITHMS I JUST MIGHT THROW THAT OUT THERE. WHAT WITH THE WAY THAT? A AND I THINK SOME OUR PANELISTS BEFORE. CORRECTLY DESCRIBED AS THE WAY I WORKS IS ASSISTANCE FEEDBACK LOOP THERE'S IS A MODEL OF. FILTER WILL CALL IN THE STATE CONTENDS IT'S LIKE YOUR BRAIN IT'S NO THAT COMPLICATED. AND WE JUST PUT A BUNCH OF DATA AND WE SAY HERE'S BUT THE CATS CATS CATS CATS CATS AND THEN IT SAYS OKAY I CAN RECOGNIZE CATS. WE PUT SOME DOGS AND CATS AND DOGS TO GET THAT AND THEN THE MAGIC OF A AYE IS YOU THROW HORSE AND THERE'S AGO IT'S NOT GONNA DIE THINGS OF COURSE. RIGHT SO STE EIGHTEEN FIGURES OUT SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T TRAIN THAT'S WHAT MAKES A AYE. DIFFERENT THAN AN ALGORITHM ALGORITHM CAN ONLY RESPOND EXACTLY TO WHAT YOU TRAINED IN NONE. SO THAT THROUGH THE BIAS ISN'T IN CONSTRUCTING THE MODEL. THE BIASES IN THE DATA NINE SO IF IF I FEED IN A AYE AND ALL I GET IS CATS. IT LOOKS OF A DOG IN NEW THE SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS YOU KNOW SO I SAY. YOU KNOW JUST DID TO GIVE MY LENDING EXAMPLE OF I SAY THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFULLY CREDIT WHERE THE ARE YOU KNOW WHITE MALES WHO ARE OVER FIFTY. AND AFTER AMERICAN PERSON TWENTY FIVE TRY SUPPLY THEY'RE GONNA SAY NO RIGHT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE DATA TELLS ME THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO OR GOOD CREDIT RISK ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT AND SO IT'S ABOUT THE DATA. IS ACTUALLY NOT ABOUT HOW YOU CREATED THE A AYE IT'S ABOUT THE DATA YOU FED THE A AYE AYE THAT'S WHY HE SAID YOU KNOW THE BROADER THAT THE DATABASES THAT THAT MORE ACCURATE ISN'T THE MORE JUST NOT DISCRIMINATORY THE THE THE IMPACT WILL BE. ABSOLUTELY AND I ALSO SAID YOU KNOW FOR CANDOR RIGHT THERE SOME PLACES WERE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SYSTEMIC BIAS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THAT DATA RIGHT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THE MAGIC THAT DATA UP ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING GREAT CREDIT SCORES WHO WERE OR MINORITIES BECAUSE. YOU KNOW SYSTEMICALLY MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED THEY DON'T HAVE GREAT CREDIT SCORES AS YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A DAY AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK TODAY JUST LIKE YOU ARE DOING TODAY. YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMBS GALLONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE ARE ON OUR UNBIASED THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT. THE SIMPLEST WAY AYE UNLIKE SOME THE THINGS EFFORT IS TESTING YOU CAN TEST THESE ALGORITHMS YOU CAN TEST THE A AYE YOU CAN THROW IN. CANDIDATES AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING BACK AND SAY OKAY I THINK THIS THING HAS OF SYSTEMIC BIAS IN IT BECAUSE THE DATA IT'S IT'S BEEN FED IS IS IS ERRONEOUS. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION AND TODAY. IF THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD BUT. I'VE BEEN TAKING NOTES OF FRANTICALLY AND TENS IS I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE TAPE AND WATCH EVERY EVERYONE OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND IN ON JUST THAT. I'M A MORE SENSE OUT OF IT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR. INTO FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING I THINK BECAUSE I'M HOPEFUL THAT. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE THAT'S GONNA NOW CONTINUE ON AND I HOPE THAT YOU ALL OF YOU WILL BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL AS WE GO. SO. WE DO WE ARE BUT I DID WANT TO ASK ONE MORE QUESTION AND THAT IS I THINK THREE OF THE PRESENTERS THEM THEY MADE MENTION OF THE WORD ETHICS AND I THINK THAT. KIND THAT UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICS THAT. AS PART OF THE EQUATION SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH TO TO INCORPORATE THAT. DE DE ETHICS A PIECE INTO THE EQUATION A WHETHER IT IS SO YOU KNOW SHOULD WE PUT IT AS PART OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE A PROGRAM OR SHOULD WE MAKE IT PART OF THAT THE TRAINING FOR WORKERS AND AND VARIOUS COMPANIES AND THE LIKE AND WHAT IS THE. I MEAN IS THERE ONE. EASY THERE'S NO EASY WAY BUT BUT WHAT WOULD BE. WHAT WE WOULD BE SOME IDEAL APPROACHES SAID IT TO INCORPORATE ETHICS INTO THE EQUATION? ANYONE. OH I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT JR. MOST INTERNET COMPANIES THAT I SPEAK WITH HAVE THEIR OWN ETHICS PANELS OKAY OF S. OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS NOW THESE ARE PEOPLE COMPENSATED BY THE DIGITAL COMPANIES. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD START AND I THINK I WANT TO APPLAUD THE LIKES OF GOOGLE AND OTHERS FOR DOING THAT. I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG. AND WE NEED TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF EXPERTS THAT. ISN'T DIALOGUE WITH THOSE PANELS AND THIS COULD BE. FRANKLY CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE IS THE RISK OF AND I'M A BUSINESS PROFESSOR SO ALL BE VERY OPEN IN MY OWN BIAS COMPANIES LIKE ADOBE AND OTHERS WILL LOSE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IF. INFORMATION ABOUT HOW ALGORITHMS A STRUCTURED OR HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS IF THAT WERE TO LEAK. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE GUARDED BECAUSE THAT. THOSE ARE THE COMPANIES THAT EMPLOY A CALIFORNIANS. AND HAVE IMPACT ECONOMIC IMPACT ABROAD BUT THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME KIND OF INDEPENDENT BODY THAT. DOES BEST PRACTICE SHARING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HEAVY HANDED DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REGULATORY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PUNITIVE. BUT IT DOES NEED TO GOVERN IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON. AND SOME KIND OF CONFIDENTIAL DIALOGUE BEHIND THE SCENES THESE COULD BE ROTATING EXPERTS THAT ARE SWORN TO SECRECY CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WHATEVER IT MAY BE. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED I THINK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AT THIS THAT'S WHAT NEEDED WHAT'S NEEDED TO INSTILL TRUST TRUST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CURRENCY. AND I I HAVE TO TELL YOU MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT I COUNSEL WHETHER THESE ARE EXECUTIVES IN MY CONSULTING BUSINESS OUR STUDENTS AND AND AND GRADUATE SCHOOL. THEY THEY UNDERSTAND THAT A WE ARE TO. A CUSTOMER THAT DOESN'T TRUST YOU IS NOT A GOOD CUSTOMER. AND SO YOU WANT TO TRUST AND YOU DON'T WANT THE PUBLIC BACKLASH SO I THINK WE'RE ALL MOTIVATED TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER. AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO. THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO. PUT A DENT INTO OUR WORK GOING TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. I I I I WORK A LOT WITH ENTREPRENEURS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS ABOUT LIVING WITH AND ACTING WITHIN IN FINDING SOLUTIONS WITHIN CONSTRAINTS. AND SOME OF THESE ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS WILL BE SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINING AND THAT'S OKAY WE WILL WE WILL WORK WITH SOLUTIONS WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS. OR THE IDEA THAT. IT WE WILL SACRIFICE ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE OF SOME ETHICS CONSTRAINTS. IS RIDICULOUS. AS THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD BUSINESS TO BE HAD WHILE BEING ETHICAL. AND I THINK WE CAN AGREE TO ON THAT SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION AND I WOULD ADD TO IT JUST ONE POINT THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND AND WE DISCUSSED IT A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW. IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS BUT THERE'S A SIMILAR MODEL THERE'S ALREADY A LITTLE BIT OF A PROXY THERE IN THAT WE DO HAVE AN ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR RESEARCH FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS. WE DO HAVE STANDARDS FOR INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT ADJACENT RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE TALKING IN THOSE SITUATIONS ABOUT RESEARCH THAT'S DONE BY EDUCATIONAL HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS AND RAT. SORT OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME WHERE INDIVIDUALS ENTREPRENEURS COMPANIES REALLY CAN ACCESS EVEN MORE INFORMATION AND DO MORE SUBSTANTIVE RESEARCH THAT IS REALLY COVERED BY. THOSE STANDARDS AND SO I THINK LOOKING AT A SYSTEM THAT WAS ALREADY DEVELOPED TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND SEEING HOW CAN WE. OVERLAY THOSE TYPE OF THINGS AS A PROXY IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S ON THIS SUBJECT WHETHER FRANKLY IT'S ON THE NATIONAL DISCUSSION AROUND. SEXUAL HARASSMENT THERE'S THERE'S OFTEN A PROBLEM WITH THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE AND SO EVEN WHERE THERE'S A DESIRE TO PROMOTE TRUST AND WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE. TRUST OF THE PUBLIC SO THAT A COMPANY DOES NOT LOSE. FRANKLY MONEY RIGHT CHAIR. AND SOMETIMES THAT PERVERTS ITSELF IN A MANNER IN WHICH PEOPLE COMPANIES TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE FREE TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DAMAGING RATHER THAN ADDRESS PROACTIVELY THE PROBLEM. AND SO. YOU KNOW I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT WATERS MODELS LIKE. DIRE BE WHAT OUR MODELS LIKE HUMAN RESEARCH LAWS THAT CAN APPLY HERE IN TERMS OF ETHICAL STANDARDS AND WHERE SOME SORT OF OUTSIDE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S NOT JUST SUBJECT DECLINE ATTORNEY PRIVILEGES OF WHOEVER'S BEEN HIRED BY. A PARTICULAR COMPANY TO ADVISE THEM ON THEIR ETHICAL STANDARDS. GOD. I GRAY SUGGESTIONS THAT WITHOUT THE O. INITIAL COMMENTS RIGHT OUT YEAH ONE ONE FINAL COMMENT SILLY THERE'S A BRIDGE WE NEED TO STRIKE HERE AND WE FRAME THIS EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AS WELL AND AND I THINK. MISS FLOCKS. SAID. SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF HOW. WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYBODY IS HAPPY WITH THEIR JOBS. IN EFFECT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS. OF FORTY FIFTY SIXTY EIGHTY PERCENT DEPENDING ON THE POLL THAT YOU LOOK AT OF PEOPLE AND THEY ARE UNHAPPY IN THEIR CURRENT JOBS. WHY THAT WHY IS THAT THE CASE IS IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING MISTER RAUH MENTIONED WHICH IS THAT IT'S TO DRUDGERY? WHY NOT HAND THE DRUDGERY TO A AYE? AND LET THE HUMANS DEAL WITH WHAT REALLY FULFILL SOME WHAT REALLY MAKES AND CREATIVE AND WHAT KEEPS THEM. YOU KNOW IT IT STIMULATED ON THE JOB SO I THINK THAT TO ME IS THE BIG PROMISE OF A AYE RIGHT TO READ DO THE CURRENT STATE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IS STILL VERY MUCH A TERRORIST SYSTEM IN MANY PLACES. WHERE PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH PACKAGED AND CATEGORIZED AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL PUNCHING IN THE CLOCK? IS THAT REALLY THE BEST WE CAN DO AS HUMANS. THANK YOU VERY GOTTA ON THAT NOTE THEY ARE. I WANNA THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND ARE. IN FACT I I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ANY OF THE OTHER PRESENTERS ARE STILL HERE BUT I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. FOR ATTENDING AYE I KNOW SOME OF YOU TRAVEL FROM AFAR SO. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE AND I THINKWE STILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT SO I'M GONNA DISMISS SOME GOOD EXCUSE ARE YOU PRESENTERS AND THANK YOU AGAIN AND TO OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I'VE THERE'S ANY. PUBLIC COMMENTS. HOW FEEL FREE TO COME ON UP ABOUT? AND THAT TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF THE IN FRONT OF MY. THANKS THANKS THANKS MUCH. WELCOME. I AS PARIS A FEW STATEMENTS CHAIR SO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ALEX. ALEX I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR AND I WORK. WITH MANY NEW EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. PARTICULARLY IN THE PHOTOGRAPHER ANGEL SERVICE OR FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY FIELD. TENTEC FLASH TECHNOLOGY. A I OR MACHINE LEARNING HAS MANY APPLICATIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES FIELD. AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCES. AND OPINIONS REGARDING THIS HEARING. I'LL JUST BRIEFLY BRIEFLY YES SIR. OKAY. SO. CALLING A I A I IS LITTLE BROAD APPROVED CALL IT MACHINE LEARNING. FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND OTHER PURPOSES CHOIR AT THE THINKS. ONE OF THE APPLICATIONS OF THE AYE THAT'S WE'VE SEEN THE FRENCH WORD WORLD OUR UNDERWRITING OR CREDIT DECISIONS. DEFAULT RATES CAN BE PUSHED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY WITH APPLICATIONS OF ALGORITHMS ALTHOUGH REGULATORS HAVE REQUIRED FINTECH OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CHAU EXACT RIGHT HERE CRITERIA WATERFALL OR BUSINESS PROCESS. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DECISIONS. KIND OF. YOU KNOW HANDCUFFING SOME OF THE. APPLICATIONS OF A AYE IN THAT SPACE. NOT INCLUSIVE AND MANY MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT OPERATIONS RESULT NO CLEAR PATH TO DECISIONS AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFYING THAT WAS APPLICATIONS THAT AFFECT CONSUMERS. OR PROTECTED CLASSES IN UNDERWRITING DECISIONS ARE CREDIT DECISIONS. AND THEN. LASTLY HOW CAN CITY CALIFORNIA BECOME MORE INNOVATIVE. MAYBE APPLY CHAT BOT FOR FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ACROSS ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS. AND APPLYING IT CONCEPT OF DESIGN THINKING. TAKING THE APPROACH OF CITIZEN. OR START RESIDENT AND WORKING BACKWARDS ON HOW TO. BEST APPLY RESOURCES. AND THEN. ONE YOU KNOW. A POTENTIAL APPLICATION AT A AYE OR MACHINE LEARNING WOULD BE. WROTE. DIDN'T. A REAL TIME. IMPACT FORECASTS AND BACK CASTING. OF OUT OF BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AND THE BENEFITS THEY BRING TO SOCIETY LIKE REAL TIME LIKE YOU. LOOK IT UP AND SEE. SCORE. AND THEN HOW CAN CALIFORNIA TRAIN RESIDENTS WHO ARE VULNERABLE TAKE TECHNOLOGY. ADVANCEMENTS. ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING. REPLACED ARE TECHNICALLY LAGGARDS IN TRAINING OR TRAINING THEMSELVES ARE APPLYING THEMSELVES. SO HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE THAT LIKE HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVELY NOT PARTICIPATING IN IT TRAINING THEMSELVES. AND SO LAST THEY'LL SAY. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SHARING PERSONAL DATA ARE NOT SHARING PERSONAL DATA IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN EXCESS THERE'S COMPANIES ARE DEVELOPING THAT. AND POLICE POWERS NEED TO BE. BALANCE WOULD PUBLIC NEEDS. AND. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILLIAM PUT PROCEED AT THAT. OTHER IN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. FROM A PUBLIC SEEING NONE. THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED. THANK YOU
