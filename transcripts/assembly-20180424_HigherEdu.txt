THANK YOU VERY MUCH JACK FOR ALL YOUR WORK. AND WITH THAT WILL BRING UP. GRAY. FILE ITEM FOR. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO OH TWO. WELCOME MR GRAY. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. LET ME START BY KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. AND REFINE ARE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THANK YOU FOR. THE ONGOING DISCUSSION ALLOWING THIS ONGOING DISCUSSION TO TAKE PLACE TO EXPLORE CREATIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WALL ALWAYS PRIORITIZING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT. AB TWENTY TWO A CHU APPROPRIATES IN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE CREATION CONSTRUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UCSF MEDICAL SCHOOL BRANCH CAMPUS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UC MERCED AND UCSF FRESNO. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE STATE BUDGET DIRECTED YOU SEE THE COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS TO CREATE A MEDICAL SCHOOL AT MERCED CAMPUS. DO YOU SEE RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR COMPLETED ANALYSIS WHICH PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. A TIMELINE OF COMPLETED MILESTONES TOWARDS THE CREATION OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACING THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MEDICAL SCHOOL BRANCH CAMPUS. THE ADEQUACY IS OF THE SAMPLE CAN DOLLARS HEALTH CARE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. AS THE UC'S REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE VALLEY'S ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING POOREST AND LEAST HEALTHY REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND HAS A LONGSTANDING SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. WE HAVE THE LOWEST RATIO OF LICENSE DANDIES DE OWES AND PEAS ARE ENDS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST LICENSE COUNSELORS AND LICENSE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE STATE. DO YOU SEE REPORT IS ONLY THE LATEST IN A TWO DECADE EFFORT TO LEVERAGE STATE ASSISTANCE FOR THE BUILD OUT OF MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE VALLEY. A FULLY INDEPENDENT MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU SEE HER SAID WAS BEING DISCUSSED BEFORE THE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUS EVEN BEGIN CONSTRUCTION. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT REPORT BY THE WASHINGTON ADVISORY GROUP KNOWN AS THE WAG REPORT ENVISIONED A UC MERCED MEDICAL SCHOOL UP AND RUNNING BY TWENTY TWELVE. AS THE STATE GRAPPLE WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION SHORTLY AFTER THE WAG REPORT WAS PUBLISHED FEW OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE EVER IMPLEMENTED. HAVING GONE THROUGH A DIFFICULT LCB LICENSING PROCESS AT UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL DO YOU SEE IN STATE HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO CITE A NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL. WITH A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS STATE IS IN A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION TO DEDICATE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST PRESSING. AND MOST IGNORED PROBLEMS. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL BRANCH CAMPUS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU SEE A STAFF. UC MERCED AND UCSF FRESNO WELL NOW THE TRAINING OF MEDICAL STUDENTS WHO WERE BORN AND RAISED IN THE REGION. AND WHO HAVE ROOTS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PRACTICE MEDICINE CLOSE TO HOME. THIS STEP WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RETURN OF FUNNELING DOCTORS INTO THE REGION WHILE PROVIDING TIME FOR THE YOU SEE TO DEVELOP A TRULY COMPELLING. AND INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL FOR A FULLY INDEPENDENT MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU SEE MERCED. IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THIS CONCEPT THE LEGISLATURE MUST PROVIDE FINANCIAL CERTAINTY. A VARIABLE WHICH INITIALLY STALLED. THE ACCREDITATION OF THE UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL ONE OF THE CHAIRS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THAT. AB TWENTY TWO A TO SEEKS TO PROVIDE THIS FINANCIAL CERTAINTY EITHER THROUGH A LARGE ONE TIME APPROPRIATION TO CREATE ANNUAL ENDOWMENT. OR THROUGH GUARANTEED ONGOING FUNDING THROUGH THE BUDGET. THIS CONTINUES TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS AND COMMITMENT MEMBERS WILL NOTICE THE BILL CURRENTLY LEAVES THE APPROPRIATION BLANK AS A RESULT. DIFFICULT AS IT MIGHT BE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS DISCUSSION FOR IT IS THE VALLEY IS BEEN THE VICTIM OF DELAYS FOR TOO LONG. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY MERCED COUNTY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AMONGST OTHERS. THERE'S NO OPPOSITION HOWEVER THE UC HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WHICH WE MUST WORK TO ADDRESS. IN PARTICULAR THE UC IS RAISED THE CONCERN THAT PREMATURE ACTION TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH CAMPUS COULD RESULT IN THE TRIGGERING A BELL CME REVIEW. AT A TIME WHEN OUR RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE NOT PREPARED TO MEET THE REVIEW STANDARDS. WITH A FAILED REVIEW DOES NOT DO A PROJECT IN PERPETUITY EACH FAILURE DOES MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT THE NEXT TIME AROUND. IS NOT MY INTENTION. THAT THE BILL. PREMATURELY FORCE ELSIE MAYER VIEW ON COMMITTED TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN HOWEVER HEALTHCARE ACCESS IN THE VALLEY HAS NOT BEEN A PRIORITY AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR TOO LONG. AND I'M EQUALLY COMMITTED TO SPOTLIGHT SPOTLIGHTING THIS ISSUE AND KEEPING A HEAVY FOOT ON THE GAS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DOCTOR PETER BROADRICK WIFE NO AND. FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED REALLY SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE VALLEY A TO PROVIDE SOME. HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND. IS AN EXCEPTION KNOWLEDGE OF FIRST ON THE SUBJECT DR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN GRAY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION I'M DOCTOR PETER BRODERICK. AND I'M PLEASED TO. KNOW TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO OH TO. I'M THE FORMER CEO OF VALLEY CONSORTIUM FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION. WHERE I WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN STARTING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST TEACHING HEALTH CENTER? AND IN THAT CAPACITY WELL I STILL SERVICES IN ORGANIZATIONAL AND. INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL OFFICER FOR THE ACCREDITATION THEIR. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR SUTTER MEDICAL GROUP WHERE I OVERSEE OUR MED STUDENT TRAINING. FOR THE NORTH CENTRAL VALLEY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN MEDICAL EDUCATION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. AND HAVE. BEEN. PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR TO RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE I CAN ATTEST. BOTH TO THE DIRE NEED. TO EXPAND MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT. AND THAT I THINK A CREATING A CENTRAL VALLEY HUB FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION WOULD HAVE. IN THE PROPOSED FUNDING THROUGH AB TWENTY TWO OO TO. I KNOW YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE HEALTH. CHALLENGES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES HEALTH OUTCOMES AND. PROVIDER. A SCARCITY IN FACT IN OUR. SUCCESSFUL FEDERAL GRANT WE CHARACTERIZE A CENTRAL VALLEY IS THE NEW APPELLATION. IT BE IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE. ISSUES YEAH. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE WASHINGTON ADVISORY GROUP PANEL TO DISCUSS THE BENEFIT. OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE IT YOU SEE MERCED ITS HORRORS. PRODUCING. MORE STUDENTS IN OUR REGION THAT CAME FROM OUR REGION AND MODESTO WE ACTUALLY. IN RESPONSE CREATED. EXPANDED POSITIONS FROM TWENTY SEVEN RESIDENTS TO FIFTY ONE RESIDENTS CURRENTLY IN ANTICIPATION SO WERE TRYING TO GET READY FOR THE EXPANSION. WAS A FORMER PROGRAM DIRECTOR I'M WELL AWARE OF THE. BENEFIT OF HER TRACK OF THE RECRUITING. STUDENTS WHO COME FROM OUR AREA WE KNOW THAT. WHEN THEY COME FROM OUR AREA WE OFTEN RETAIN THEM IN OUROUR EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO FRESNO ABOUT HALF OF OUR. GRADUATES STAY IN THE REGION WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY TREMENDOUS FOR US. AND THE TRUTH IS HAVING A HUB OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK WILL ENHANCE OUR CALIBER AND OUR ABILITY TO REALLY ATTRACT LOCAL TALENT. NOW YOU KNOW TRAINING THEM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY HELPS THEM STAY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA IS A NET EXPORTER OF MEDICAL STUDENTS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE HOT. WE SEND THEM OUT AND BRING THEM BACK AFTER ALL THEIR TRAINING. IT IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE THERE DISCONNECTED TO THE LOCATION WHERE THEY TRAIN THEM. OUT WE KNOW THAT IF WE TRAIN. STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY IN RESIDENCY THEY TEND TO STAY IN THAT LOCATION MORE AND CERTAINLY CREATING A PIPELINE THAT IDENTIFIES TALENTED REGIONAL UNDERGRADUATES. FOSTER'S THEM TO BECOME COMPETITIVE MEDICAL STUDENT CANDIDATES. SUPPORTS THEM THROUGH. AFFORDABLE. AND MEDICAL EDUCATION AND ALSO THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC. TRAINING IN RESIDENCY I THINK WILL CREATE A SOLUTION FOR SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE BY TRAINING AND RETAINING OUR STUDENTS. CERTAINLY WHERE OF FACING SOME REAL CHALLENGES WITH. THE AGING MARROW PHYSICIAN POPULATION I'VE MYSELF TURNED FIFTY SEVEN SO I'M AMONG THE GROUP OVER FIFTY FIVE WHO. ARE SET TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND WE ARE NOT REPLACING THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS THAT ARE RETIRING. THE PROPOSED MECHANISM OF AB TWENTY TWO A TO ADD BY CREATING A BRANCH CAMPUS OF UCSF AT UC MERCED. OF FOR BAY BASIC SCIENCE EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL TRAINING THEY CAN GET CLINICALLY IN THIS IN THE VALLEY PARTICULARLY AT UCSF FRESNO. I THINK THAT WILL BE A MODEL AND HAS BEEN A MODEL THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS USED SUCCESSFULLY. IN FACT. GERMAN MEDINA I WAS. UC RIVERSIDE UNDERGRADUATE I WAS ATTRACTED TO UC RIVERSIDE BECAUSE OF ITS BRANCH CAMPUS STATUS WITH UCLA. ALTHOUGH I CHOSE TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL UCSF I WAS IMPRESSED. BY THE CALIBER OF STUDENTS THAT THE SCHOOL ATTRACTED I THINK BECAUSE OF ITS BRANCH CAMPUS IDENTITY. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IDENTITY WILL HELP YOU SEE MERCED IN RECRUITMENT AS WELL. SOME. THAT THE TRUTH IS THAT. IN. TERMS OF QUALITY OF MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE CLINICAL CAMPUS AT UCSF FRESNO IS. ON PAR WITH ALL THE MAJOR MEDICAL SCHOOLS. I MYSELF AS A MEDICAL STUDENT AT UCSF SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN FRESNO DOING MY CLINICAL TRAINING AS PART OF MY COMMUNITY BASED CURRICULUM. AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW SOME OF THE HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND ACTUALLY THAT IMPACTFUL EXPERIENCE MADE ME WANT TO PURSUE FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINING. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN I WENT ON TO PRACTICE IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED TO SIN. ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE BETWEEN MERCED IN MODESTO. CERTAINLY IN IN TERMS OF. V. AB TWENTY TWO OR TWO IT IS A AND IT IS PART OF A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH CERTAINLY WE NEED TO GROW. UP A POSTGRADUATE RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS BUT HAVING A PIPELINE OF GOOD STUDENTS IT WILL HELP US DO THAT. I THINK BY CREATING. UCSF FRESNO CAMPUS. THAT KEEPS THE CALIBER VERY HIGH THE ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS ARE IMPECCABLE IN AND CERTAINLY I THINK AS WE PRODUCE A LARGER PIPELINE WE CAN GROW OUR MEDICAL EDUCATION BOTH. UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE AND HOPEFULLY RETAIN MORE PHYSICIANS AND HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON. THE REGION WHICH IS REALLY IN DIRE NEED OF ATTENTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES. IN BETWEEN THERE ANY TWEENER. BRING UP THE TWO WINNERS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANGELA GILLIARD I REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'M WE'RE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS IS ASSEMBLYMAN GRAY. ALLUDED TO. AND. I'M I'M HERE I AM ACCOMPANIED TODAY BY MIKE PETERSON. ARE FROM YOU SEE IS EFFORT PHOTO WHO IS A. AB WILL INTRODUCE HIMSELF AND DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS IN MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AS ANGELA SAID I'M MICHAEL PETERSON LIVE THE PRIVILEGE CURRENTLY OF SERVING AS THE CURRENT ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR THE UC SFS NO MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM. THIS LEGISLATURE. ESTABLISHED OUR CAMPUS FORTY THREE YEARS AGO TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GRADUATED WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS AND CURRENTLY HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS IN OUR PROGRAM. AND WE RETAIN AS NOTED EARLIER BY PETER FIFTY PERCENT OF THEM IN THE VALLEY THE CENTRAL VALLEY TOGETHER WITH THE INLAND EMPIRE REMAIN THE MOST POSITION UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HIGHLY VALUE ASSEMBLYMAN GRAYS AND OTHER LEGISLATORS INTEREST IN EXPANDING MEDICAL EDUCATION ESPECIALLY FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM AND INTERESTED IN RETURNING TO THE VALLEY TO PRACTICE. TOGETHER WITH YOU SEE US OUT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WE EMBARKED ON A TWO YEAR PLANNING PROCESS TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY TOWARDS A FULL UCSF BRANCH CAMPUS AND ULTIMATELY AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE VALLEY. THE FIRST STEP IS TO ESTABLISH AN ACCREDITED BRANCH CAMPUS TO THE LIAISON COMMITTEE FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION THE LCM ME. THE BODY THAT REVIEWS AND APPROVES ALL ALLOPATHIC THAT IS MD GRANTING MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. OUR APPLICATION TO THE LCM IS BASED ON THE ROBUST MEDICAL EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT UCSF FRESNO. THE LCM IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING OUR APPLICATION. WHILE WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SIX SUPPORT EXPANDING OUR ABILITY TO TRAIN PHYSICIANS FOR THE VALLEY. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH AB TWENTY TWO OH TWO AS NOTED BY ASSEMBLYMAN GRAY. FIRST INCLUDING YOU SEE MERCED IN THE LANGUAGE FOR THIS PRANK CAT BRANCH CAMPUS WILL LIKELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO RECEIVE APPROVAL FROM THE LCM ME. BECAUSE YOU SEE MERCED HAS NOT YET DEVELOPED SUFFICIENT MEDICAL EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THE HIGH LC EMMYS STANDARDS. WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU SEE MERCED FACULTY IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO DEVELOP THE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE THAT THE L. CME REQUIRES. HOWEVER TOWARDS THAT STEP WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR YOU SEE MERCED FACULTY COMING DOWN TO FRESNO EVERY WEEK. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATION OF YOU SEE US UP MEDICAL STUDENTS. SO EXPANDING TO FORTY EIGHT STUDENTS ARE ULTIMATELY. IN THE NEXT PHASE IS GOING TO BE A BIG STEP. THIS FIRST STEP. WITH THE ST WOMAN GRAY IN PHASE ONE WAS REALLY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM AND THE ENHANCEMENT FUNDING THAT HE. BROUGHT TO US THIS WAS A BIG STEP FOR IT ALLOWED US TO BUILD SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE IT YOU SEE A SELF FRESNO. UP PRIOR TO THIS. I ALSO REALIZE THAT THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE AND NOT ONE ON APPROPRIATIONS BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING MODEL IN THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT WE DEVELOPED IN THE TO YOUR PLANNING PROCESS. IN THIS MODEL WAS REALLY BASED ON BUILDING ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT UCSF FRESNO AND NOT THE MORE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE THERE. FOR BUILDING OUT A YOU SEE MERCED BRANCH CAMPUS. SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU TODAY AND EXPRESS OUR PROFOUND INTEREST IN BUILDING CAPACITY FOR HEALTH CARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GRAY AND OTHERS IN THIS PROCESS THANK YOU YOU. OTHER WIENERS. I AM ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT APOLOGIZING CURRENT MUSCLE MOVING HERE FASTER KAREN LAYING ON DOUBLE THE MERCED COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THIS BILL IS URGENTLY NEEDED AND THE VALLEY FOR ALL OF THE REASONS I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY EARD ABOUT. SO WE ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND THANK YOU TO MISTER GRAY FOR SIGNING AN EARLY. YOU. ANY WITNESSES I'M SORRY SUPPORT WING. MAX PARA CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER PATTERSON. COULD YOU EXPLAIN JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERN OVER OVER FRESNO. DOES THIS. EXCLUDES MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR FRESNO TO MOVE FORWARD OR OR NOT AND YOU ARE A TWEENER SO UNITED OPPOSITION CORRECT ALRIGHT THANK YOU. NOT. IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF OF THE EFFORT HERE. SURPASSING WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. UP UNTIL THIS YEAR HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ENGAGE IN THE UC MERCED EFFORT FOR ABOUT AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL CAMPUS. YEAH THAT GOES BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE. ON WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS TRYING TO MARRY AT THE INTEREST OF UCSF WITH THE INTEREST OF LONG TERM OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU SEE MERCED. FRANKLY THE ENTIRE VALLEY SUFFERS FROM THESE POSITION A PATIENT RATIOS A LOT OF THE SAME ISSUES. AND YOU SEE THE SAP IS WELL POSITIONED GIVEN THE. THE LAST FOUR DECADES OF WORK THEY'VE DONE IN THE VALLEY OF THE AS WE A INVEST MORE IN THE UCSF PROGRAM. THEY PARTNER WITH YOU SERVICE THAT WE CREATE THAT OPPORTUNITY SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS TRADE BETWEEN UCLA AND UC RIVERSIDE. PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL UC RIVERSIDE AND IF ALL LET DOCTOR PETERSON. FOLLOW UP. YES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS AND THERE ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE LCM ME IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH CAMPUS. WHEN WE. LET THE LCM YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE DOING THAT. THEY REQUIRE A CONSULTATION WHICH IS AN APPLICATION AND REVIEW IN THEIR CURRENTLY IN THAT REVIEW PROCESS. AND THAT APPLICATION PROCESS CONTAINS A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE FOR A BRANCH CAMPUS WHICH WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT ARE IN PLACE IT YOU SEE YOURSELF FRESNO. BUT INCLUDING YOU SEE MERCED IN THAT THEN RAISES THE ISSUE ABOUT WHAT WHAT DEFICITS MAY EXIST CURRENTLY AT UC MERCED. THAT WE COULD USE THIS NEXT PHASE TO BEGIN TO BUILD OUT CAPACITY IN ADDRESS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OUT WE'RE GONNA PAUSE FOR FOR A SECOND BEFORE ASK YOU TO CLOSE TO IT TO. ESTABLISH COR. SIR. MEDINA PRESIDENT. BAKER. ARAMBULA. BLOOM. CHAVEZ IRWIN. KILEY. LEVINE. LOW. PATTERSON. QUIRK SILVA. SANTIAGO WEBER. QUORUM IS PRESENT MISTER A WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU. THEY WAS CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. DON'T CLOSING. EVERS FOR EVERY. ONE STUDENT WHO GRADUATES UNIVERSITY HERE CALIFORNIA GOES TO MED SCHOOL ON FOR STUDENTS GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND. UP IN DOWN THE STATE WE HAVE AN AGING POSITION POPULATION AS WELL AS OTHER AGING HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE. I AND THE CONVERSATION HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY. A BEEN ON COVERAGE AND NOW MORE RECENTLY COST CONTAINMENT. NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS ARE IMPACTING. THE LEAST AMONGST US A IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN OTHER AREAS THAT ARE HURT. WHEN YOU HAND ME AN INSURANCE CARD AND I CAN ACCESS A POSITION I END UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHICH IS THE SAME PLACE I WENT BEFORE HAD INSURANCE CARD. WHEN YOU A DEAL OF COST CONTAINMENT. IT FURTHER. FRANKLY ERODES THE ABILITY OF FOLKS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WITH A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE POSITIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO GET IN AND GET CARE. AND SO WE TRULY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND AND I WOULD I RECOGNIZE. THE EXPENSE OF THIS UNDERTAKING I RECOGNIZE. THE DELAY IN THIS UNDERTAKING BUT IF WE CAN'T ADDRESS THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE HAS. RECORD SURPLUS. IN ONE OF THE LONGEST ECONOMIC GROWTH PERIODS IN LAST HUNDRED YEARS. THEN WE'RE LIKELY NEVER GONNA ADDRESS THIS AND. AT THE TIME IS NOW TO MOVE FORWARD A THERE'S BEEN SEPARATE EFFORTS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA THAT WAS WORKING OUT ISSUE WHICH FRESNO STATE UC MERCED EFFORT GOES BACK INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. OF A IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT BY TWENTY TWELVE IN THE BAG REPORT TWENTY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RATHER. AND. WE'VE PUT ALL THAT BEHIND US WE'VE GOT IT UNITED THE EFFORTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UCSF NOW. TRYING TO STRENGTHEN. HEALTH CARE SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERY IN THE VALLEY AND I WOULD APPRECIATE. YOUR AYE VOTE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. WE HAD A MOTION BY. THIS BAKER. MAY COME WAITING FOR A SECOND. SECOND BY MISTER KILEY. UP. I'M SORRY. MR LEVINE. THANK YOU. WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION IS VERY REMINISCENT OF THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU SEE RIVERSIDE. AND WE STILL SHARE. THE NEED FOR DOCTORS IN RIVERSIDE AS MUCH AS I HEAR. THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO I AM A VERY SYMPATHETIC AND APPRECIATE THE. THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER. A TO MOVE. THIS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOWARDS MORE DOCTORS. SO I AM. ITS SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MADAM SECRETARY OF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE ARAMBULA BLOOM. CHáVEZ IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO WEBER. SIX ZERO YOUR BILL WILL BE ON CALL. A RESEARCHER THANK YOU. NEXT ITEM THIRTEEN MISTER GLORIA. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX WELCOME AND YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I BRING TO YOU THIS AFTERNOON A BILL THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AS THE LEGISLATURE'S ONLY ENROLLED TRIBAL MEMBER. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX SEEKS TO FINALLY PUT AN END TO THE DECADES OLD CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DISPOSITION OF NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS REMAINS THAT ARE HELD BY VARIOUS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. AS YOUR INCREDIBLE ANALYSIS BY YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WHICH I SAY THANK YOU UP POINTS OUT AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE YOU SEE REGION'S TO ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT A SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEE. AND CAMPUS SPECIFIC COMMITTEES TO ADDRESS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE POSSESSION OF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S CAMPUSES AS WELL AS THEIR MUSEUMS. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX COMES OUT OF DECADES OF LEGISLATION OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THREATS OF LITIGATION FROM NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF THE NET THE FEDERAL NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY THIS LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED AB NINE SEVENTY EIGHT BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DARRELL STEINBERG. TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW FEDERAL LAW. REGRETTABLY SEVERAL UC CAMPUSES HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED TO PRODUCE IMPLEMENT THE LAW AS INTENDED BUT SEVERAL OF OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS REPORT TO THE UC SYSTEM. HAS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INVOLVE TRAVEL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE IMPORTANT PROCESS HE'S. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE STATE SENATE'S GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO EXAMINE THIS VERY ISSUE. WHILE MOST OF US WERE NOT SERVING LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME ACCORDING TO THE TRANSCRIPT IT IS CLEAR THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD THEN FRUSTRATED BY THE UC'S LACK OF PROGRESS IN REPATRIATING. THESE MOST IMPORTANT REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS. IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY OF THESE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS OUR CONTINUE TO BE HOUSED IN STORAGE UNITS AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT THEY DO NOT RESPECT. THE SACRED NATURE OF THESE ITEMS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW NATIVE AMERICANS BELIEVE THEIR ANCESTORS CANNOT REST UNTIL THE REMAINS ARE PROPERLY CARED FOR MAKING THIS BILL DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ALL OF US THAT IT INVOLVES. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY FOR A BIG TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX TO HOPEFULLY ONCE AND FOR ALL CONCLUDE THIS CONVERSATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN HAVING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR DECADES NOW. I THAT'S TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE USE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO HEAR SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE CHALLENGES. AT FOUR EIGHT FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION AND REQUEST A TOUR OF A FACILITY WHERE THESE ARE BEING AWARE THESE REMAINS ARE BEING HELD. I LIKE TO THANK YOU SEE FOR GETTING BACK TO ME TODAY. WHY DO NOT PLAN TO SIT WHY DO YOU PLAN TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU SEE TO DISCUSS THEIR CONCERNS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH WHAT YOU MAY HEAR IN TERMS OF TESTIMONY? THE NOTION THAT THE PROVISIONS THAT THIS BILL WOULD SOMEHOW DELAY OR SLOWDOWN REPATRIATION EFFORTS. MUCH RESPECTFULLY POINT OUT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE SITUATION SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER THE STEINBERG BILL BECAME LAW IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION. IT STRIKES ME AS AN DISINGENUOUS FOR ANYONE TO SUGGEST THAT THE PROCESS POPS PROCESS KEY MADE ANY SLOWER THAN IT'S ALREADY BEEN. SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WITHOUT I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY CHAIRMAN MARK WHAT MAKAROV WITH THAT WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN. OF THE PECHANGA BAND OF THE SENIOR INDIANS TO SUPPORT A TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. MR. WELCOME GERMAN. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. PULLOVER HUNK I. GOOD AFTERNOON LOVE A CUP RIVER OUT WILL NOT LEAVE UP TO ABOUT ASH KNOWN MAKARA THE JOHN AMPLE BRUSHING ATTY. TALKING AT THE CHAU ON A TOUGH. HI MY NAME IS MARK MAKAROV THE TRIBAL CHAIRMAN FOR THE JUG BAND OF THE SENATE INDIANS. HELLO AT RIGHT NOW THAT I'M IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN GRADUATE IF UC AND UC SANTA BARBARA. WOULD BE A POLITICAL SCIENCE. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN RETURNING OUR ANCESTORS IN THEIR FUNERARY. TO THEIR FUNERARY HOME TO WHERE THEY BELONG SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM A PROPER BURIAL. WITH THE RESPECT THE DIGNITY THAT THEY AND ALL THE OTHER REMAINS HAVE OF. ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE DESERVE. AND CALIFORNIA HOME TO THE MOST FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED. NUMBER OF TRIBES IN THE COUNTRY HUNDRED AND TEN. THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT. OF NINETEEN NINETY THINK IT HAS A KNACK PARA. HAS PROVEN INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES MY ANCESTORS ARE STILL SEEN AS SPECIMENS THAT'S THE JARGON THAT'S USED. TO MANY RESEARCHERS INSTEAD OF HUMAN BEINGS WITH THE RIGHT TO A FINAL RESTING PLACE. HOW UNIVERSITIES HAVE FOUND WAYS UNDER THE CURRENT NAG FOR LAW TO STALL THE REPATRIATION PROCESS AND IN MANY CASES OUTRIGHT DENY CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR REPATRIATION? IF FACT. AS OF JUNE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN UC BERKELEY HAD REPATRIATED ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF ITS TEN THOUSAND REMAINS. ALL OVER ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AND EVEN MORE APPALLING IS THAT THESE REPATRIATIONS ARE BASED ON AN INVENTORY AUDIT THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE. REQUIRING ARE NOT IT EVERY TWO YEARS IS REASONABLE. AND IT WOULD FORESTALL THE INSTITUTIONAL CALLED THE SAXON DEAD ENDS THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN TRYING TO REPATRIATE. THE DENIAL OF THE RETURNS OF OUR ANCESTORS AND THOSE OF OTHER CALIFORNIA TRIBES WHOSE HUMAN BONES WERE DUG UP IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE IS A DISGRACEFUL VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN DECENCY. ONE OF OUR WITNESSES TODAY WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT DUE TO COMMITMENTS THAT SHE HAD A THE BURIAL CEREMONY THIS EVENING. HER NAME MYRA MUST YELLS IN MARA ONE OF OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS EARNED A BA IN ANTHROPOLOGY FROM UC BERKELEY. AND HER MASTER'S DEGREE IN ANTHROPOLOGY ARE FROM SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. SHE'S NOW A STATE REGISTERED ARCHAEOLOGIST AND SHE SERVES ON OUR STAFF IS A TRIBAL ARCHAEOLOGIST IN CURATOR WITH THEIR CULTURAL RESOURCES DEPARTMENT. MARA WAS ALSO AN UNDERGRADUATE IN TURN IN THE NAC PRINTED VISION AT THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM AT UC BERKELEY. ASSISTING WITH NOT PRO REPATRIATION FOR CALIFORNIA TRIBES DURING THAT TIME. SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING INVENTORY FOR KNACK FOR COLLECTIONS AND DURING A CONSULTATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TRIBE. A CART OF ASSOCIATIVE FUNERARY OBJECTS IS BROUGHT OUT THAT THE TRIBE WAS REQUESTING TO REPATRIATE. DURING THE CONSULTATION TRIBAL ELDERS INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT THERE WERE ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THEIR CURRENT REPATRIATION CLAIM. BUT MUSEUM OFFICIALS DENIED THAT ANY OF ADDITIONAL ITEMS WERE IN THE MUSEUM'S POSSESSION. BECAUSE MYRA HAD TO CHECK THE INVENTORIES OF ON THAT FOR ITEMS SHE KNEW PERSONALLY. THERE WERE INDEED ADDITIONAL FUNERARY OBJECTS THAT THE MUSEUM WAS FAILING TO IDENTIFY. IT IS TESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY DISRESPECTFUL BREED MISTRUST AND NECESSITATE THIS BILL. YOU SEE WILL WILL SAY THAT THEY TREAT HUMAN REMAINS WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY WHILE USING JARGON WORDS LIKE SPECIMEN. THAT ARE DEVOID OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY DIGNITY AND YET AS MYRA PROTESTS AND SHE IS AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROFESSIONAL THE REMAINS OF OUR ANCESTORS LIE IN SUPERBLOCK BAGS ON MUSEUM SHELVES. ASK YOURSELVES DE HUMAN REMAINS AND SIMPLOT BAGS REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S RESPECT TOWARD TRAVEL PEOPLE. THIS BILL WILL COMPEL THESE INSTITUTIONS TO FINALLY TAKE CONSULTATION AND OUTREACH TO TRIBE SERIOUSLY. IN ORDER TO RETURN HUMAN REMAINS IN THOSE PEOPLE'S PERSONAL POSSESSIONS OFTEN MUSEUMS SHELVES AND RETURN THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR TRIBES PROPER CARE AS IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE LAST TWO DECADES CALIFORNIA'S MADE GREAT STRIDES TOWARD TREATING INDIAN TRIBES WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. OUR STATE RIGHTFULLY PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE NATION ON CERTAIN ISSUES LIKE. CLEAN ENVIRONMENT RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUSINESS INNOVATION IN HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTIONS BUT MUCH OF WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDER KNACK PROP IS NOT CONSISTENT AND IS ABSOLUTELY INCONGRUENT. WITH THIS RECORD THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. AS SUCH WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY SIX ON BEHALF OF THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR FINAL RESTING PLACES AND IN MANY CASES DUG UP OVER A CENTURY AGO. AND SUBJECTED TO DESECRATION. ALTHOUGH WERE CRITICAL OF UC'S HANDLING OF ACCRATODAY FOR ME AT THAT WITHIN MY OWN TRIBE I AT LEAST. AT LEAST TWENTY PITANGA TRAVEL CITIZENS THAT ARE ALUMNI OF THE UC AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCLUDING OF COURSE MYSELF INTO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TWO OF OUR IN HOUSE TRAVEL ATTORNEYS OF COURSE MYRA OUR TRAVEL ARCHAEOLOGIST. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE POSITION ON THIS BILL THIS TIME IN FACT IS IS NOTED YOUR ANALYSIS. WE HAD EXPRESSED CONCERNS. IN THE ORIGINAL FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE LAST WEEK I WON'T GO OVER THOSE AGAIN TODAY OF THEIR PROPERLY RECOGNIZED I JUST ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH THE UNIVERSITY TAKES THIS. CONVERSATION. OVERALL IT WOULD TO LOOK FORWARD TO SITTING DOWN WITH THE. AUTHOR EARLY NEXT WEEK TO TALK THROUGH THIS WITH A CAMPUS REPRESENTATIVES. IF YOU. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE ACT COMMITTEE MS BAKER. JUST I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND. REALLY HOPE THAT THAT YOU SEE WILL. THOROUGHLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY BRING THIS TO RESOLUTION. I WASN'T AWARE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE AND FOR HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. AND HOW PERSONAL. AND ISSUE IT IS AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO THAT TO EXPEDITE THAT AND I'M OUT OF COURSE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE UNIVERSITY THAT. TO WRAP IT UP THANK YOU. WAS QUIRK SILVA. UP I ALSO AGREE WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER'S. REMARKS BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE GROUCHY IN THE SENSE THAT. A. I'M JUST SHOCKED. THAT THE YOU SEE A. HAS CHOSEN TO GO DOWN THIS PATH WHERE. THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION NEEDS TO BE FORCED WITHOUT THEM COMING TO THE TABLE KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. KNOW I'M BEEN A TEACHER FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHER FOR. CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS AND. OFTEN TAUGHT FOURTH GRADE WHICH IS CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND SO WE ALWAYS DID. WHAT IS ASKED OF US AS TEACHERS TAKE OUR? STUDENTS TO A. VARIOUS MUSEUMS. VARIOUS EXPERIENCES MANY TIMES WE'D GO DOWN TO THE SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO. MISSION BUT WE ALSO HAVE CHOICES IN TEACHING SO I MADE IT A POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT I COULD TEACH STORIES THAT I THOUGHT REALLY REFLECTED THE CULTURE OF OUR NATIVE MET MERRICK AND. INDIANS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD. HOW CALIFORNIA PLAYED A ROLE? AND SO FORTH AND SO TO TO AGAIN SEE THAT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU MENTIONED WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN TRIBES AND. THE RICH CULTURE THAT CAME FOR BEFORE WE WERE HERE AND TO SEE LIKE YOU SAY OUT REMAINS THAT FOR ANY NOXIOUS CULTURE BUT FAMILY ARE SO PRECIOUS. THAT WE WOODS PUT HIM ON A SHELF AND BUT NOT A RETURN THEM. IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL I THINK YOU SEE REALLY NEEDS TO REVISIT THE POLICY MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY.

CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS GRADUATE CAL COLLEGE WITH AN AVERAGE LOAN DEBT ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PAY FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE PERCENT IN INTEREST OVER THE TEN YEAR REPAYMENT PLAN. INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE ANOTHER FINANCING OPTION TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE MONETARY BURDEN ON STUDENTS ARE NEED A BACHELOR'S DEGREES. UNLIKE STUDENT LOANS THERE ARE NO INTEREST CHARGES WITH AYE ESSAYS.

I THINK VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE ADDS THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO SUMMER SESSIONS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT CAL GRANT A AND B. COLLEGE GRADUATE DEFICIT. A LARGE IMPEDIMENT TO GRADUATION RATES IS THE LACK OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS DURING SUMMER SESSIONS CURRENTLY. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS CANNOT BE AWARDED A CAL GRANT A OR B. FOR MORE THAN FOUR ACADEMIC YEARS. OF FULL TIME ATTENDANCE THIS MEANS THAT EIGHT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS RECEIVE IN A FOUR YEAR PERIOD MAY NOT BE INCREASEDOF A STUDENT IS ACCELERATING THEIR GRADUATION. BY ATTENDING SUMMER SESSIONS. ACCORDING TO YOU SEE FRESHMAN ENTRANCE WHO DO NOT ENROLL IN SUMMER HAVE A SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT SIX YOUR GRADUATION RATE COMPARED EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO ENROLL. ONE SUMMER TERM OR NINETY TWO PERCENT FOR TWO SUMMER TERMS. AND NINETY ONE PERCENT FOR THREE OR MORE SUMMER TERMS. A. B. THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE WILL HELP STINSON PURSES REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN IN GRADUATE IN A FASTER TIMEFRAME WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS RYAN BRAUN ISSUED FROM SECULAR STATE. I THINK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLYMAN. AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. AS HE SAID MY NAME IS RYAN BRAUN. I'M A STUDENT AT SACRAMENTO STATE A DOUBLE MAJOR IN PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ECONOMICS. I'M EXCITED TO BE GRADUATING IN FOUR WEEKS. HOWEVER I WOULD NOT BE GRADUATING IN FOUR WEEKS IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF SUMMER COURSES FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE MY EDUCATION A TIMELY MANNER. UNFORTUNATELY. THE SUMMER COURSES DUE TO THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH COST PER UNIT. A AND IT'S. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT IT PUT ON ME AS A STUDENT. I NOT ONLY WAS I OBLIGATED TO TAKE A SECOND JOB DURING THE ACADEMIC SCHOOL YEAR. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT THE SUMMER UNITS WHICH TOTALED. A SLIGHTLY OVER EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. ABOUT ALSO FORCE TAKE OUT AN ADDITIONAL FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS WILL BE REPAYING FOR. THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AFTER GRADUATION. I'M PROUD TO BE BREALEY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL BECAUSE NOT ONLY WAS IT ORIGINATED BY STUDENTS BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY HEAVILY PROMOTED BY STUDENTS. AND THIS MY STORY. IS NOT AS MINE IT'S HEARD REALLY ACROSS EVERY STUDENTS IN THE YOU SEE ON THE CSU. I'VE FACED MANY BOTTLENECK COURSES I AM A PUBLIC RELATIONS COURSE WORK IN THAT SAUDIS ARE COURSES THAT HAVE EASILY HUNDRED TWENTY STUDENTS OUT OF WHICH MAYBE. UP FORTY PASS ON REGULARITY. AYE AND THEREFORE THESE COURSES DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR UNIT LOAD. AND WHEN THERE'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH COURSES DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL YEAR STUDENTS ARE OBLIGATED TO DO ONE OF TWO THINGS. EITHER THEY EXTEND THEIR GRADUATION SOMETIMES INDEFINITELY. I KNOW STUDENTS IN THE MATH PROGRAM AT SAC STATE WHOSE EXTENDED HER GRADUATION TIME AT SEVEN YEARS. ARE BECAUSE OF THE AND AVAILABILITY OF BOTTLENECK COURSES. OR THE OTHER OPTION IS TAKE SUMMER CLASSES. HOWEVER FOR MANY STUDENTS WHILE THE SUMMER CLASSES EXIST THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED UPON STATE. AND OF BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS LIKE OVER ENROLLMENT IN THE UC AND THE CSU OBLIGATED UP BY THE STATE'S. WE HAVE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CLASSES BUT LIKE I SAID A MOMENT AGO ADDITIONAL CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVELY MEANINGLESS UNLESS THEY'RE ACCEPTABLE OR THEIR. ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS. AND BY THAT ONCE AGAIN I MEAN BEING EXCEEDINGLY HIGH FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON STUDENTS WHEN TRYING TO ACCESS THE SUMMER CLASSES. IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO GRADUATE ON TIME IT SHOULD BE TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND FULFILL THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR DEBT. NOT DOLLAR STUDENTS DEBT. THAT THE STATE HOUSE IN THAN THEIR NEED FOR GRADUATES BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE MUST MAKE SUMMER CLASSES MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS BY EXTENDING CALTRANS. BOB AND SPONSORING THAT THEY CAN NOT ONLY GRADUATE ON TIME A GRADUATE WITH LESS OF A DEBT LOAD. AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALSO LIKE INJURIES COULD HAVE BEEN OSHA ADVENTURE KAKWA FROM THE CHAIR OF THE WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE COW COALITION FOR A BETTER YOU SEE AT UC SANTA BARBARA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ALSO THE REDUCING. I'M GONNA HAVE TO IT IS A JUDGMENT. MY NAME IS COMMON BUT NOT ABLE TO COOKWARE AMADOR TO PUT THE SCIENCE MAJOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA. NOW MOST OF THE PUNDITS HAVE THE CODES FOR BDC WHICH SISTER RIGHT ACTIVIST GROUP AT UCSB. TO DATE HOWEVER PRESENTING UNIVERSITAT APPOINTEES ASSOCIATION. AND EXPLAIN WHY WE'RE SPONSORING AB THAT ONE FIVE THREE WHICH IS A BOTH A LIST EXTEND SOME CONFERENCE. NOW YOU MAY WONDER WHY SUITS HAVE DRIVEN FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO TALK TO YOU BUT A. B. THIRTY ONE FIVE THREE. YOU MAY WONDER WHY THIS BILL WHICH MAKES THE CABIN AVAILABLE FOR NINE UNITS PER SOME ATTEMPT. FOR TWO ADDITIONAL SUMMIT TERMS MATTER SO MUCH THE STUDENTS IN THIS ROOM. WELL I'M HERE TO TIE THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE QUESTIONS. WE QUESTION WIDE MAJORITY OPPRESSION RECENT BLACK AND BROWN PUBLIC RECIPIENTS INVOLVED IN THE UC SYSTEM I'M NOT GRADUATING WITH THEM FOR YEARS. WE QUESTION WHY OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE CASTING UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE NOT GRADUATING WITH THEM FOR YEARS. WE QUESTION WHY WERE EXPECTED TO CELEBRATE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES WERE TOLD THEY WERE ATTENDING FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS. AND CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL FOR YOUR AVERAGE BECAUSE GRADUATION IS AROUND FORTY PERCENT WE QUESTION WITH THE IDEA OF A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION ACTUALLY EXISTS. WHAT THEY HAVE THAT SUMMIT BE PERPETUATED A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS WEBSITE PAGES? NOW. ALL QUESTIONS HAVE NOT REMAIN QUESTIONS. BUT IT BECOME FEARS AS MY FRIEND. SIDE OVER HERE THE PUBLIC POLICY IS THAT OF CALIFORNIA DO RESEARCH SAYING THAT IF CURRENT TRENDS PERSIST BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A COLLEGE GRADUATE DEFICIT OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION. IT IS A GENERAL THAT IS NOT JUST AN EDUCATION CRISIS BUT THAT IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. HOWEVER. BECAUSE YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO DID JUST COME. WHAT QUESTIONS BECAME TO SOLUTION? AND THAT'S SOLUTION IS AB THERE ONE FIVE THREE. THE BILL WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WHEN STUDENTS TAKE MORE SUMMER COURSES THE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE ON TIME. THE BILL THAT WE WERE STUDENTS WAY ROLLED WILL ALREADY HAVE TWELVE MONTH HOUSING LEASES. READ THEM PUNISHING THEM FOR STATE MATT OF IRAN MEANT THAT I MADE A CLASS IS OVER AND ROLL TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN GET THEIR CLASSES TO THE RIG ACADEMIC YEAR. THE BILL. OTHER BIG MONEY.

THAT DATA AND TRY TO. TO. BE FAIR WITH REAL RESULTS FOR THEM SAID THANK YOU. MISS QUIRK SILVA AND THEN MISTER BAD. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS LEGISLATION. THIS SUMMER HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SUMMER PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO RESERVE FOR UP TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT FOR THAT IS REALLY HUGE I WAS SOMEBODY MANY MANY YEARS AGO WHO WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. THROUGH A YOU SEE A UCLA BUT I ALSO TOOK ME OUT NOT ONLY SUMMER SCHOOL BUT EVEN AT THAT TIME THEY HAD WINTER OFFERINGS SO. THING IT REALLY IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM WITHOUT OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL AND AS MENTIONED MANY STUDENTS DON'T TAKE IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT SO THANK YOU I THINK THIS WILL.

AS THE WITNESSES STATED WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WANT. OF RECOGNIZING THIS BILL WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT I URGE THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER THE COST ISSUE AND TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE REMEDIES. THAT ARE RAISED IN THEIR ANALYSIS SO THE MOTION WAS DUE PASSED APPROPRIATIONS. MADAM SECRETARY OF YOU WOULD CABALLERO. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE ARAMBULA BLOOM. CHAVEZ IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW. PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBER I. PAGE ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. IAM GOING TO LOOK TO MISS. CABALLERO FOR HER INDULGENCE. IF THE IF YOU AYE I MIGHT. MISTER CUNNINGHAM HAS A STUDENTS HERE FROM CAL POLY POMONA WHO HAVE TO DRIVE BACK TO CAL POLY. THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISS GOV AHEAD OF. SO WE WILL GO TO ITEM SIX MISTER CUNNINGHAM. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY STUDENT WITNESSES ARE. ON THEIR WAY THAT'LL GET STARTED IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FIVE AND I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THEM FOR THE. HARD WORK ON THIS. OVER THE COURSE OF A SINGLE SCHOOL YEAR THE AVERAGE COLLEGE STUDENT. ACCORDING TO THE COLLEGE BOARD SPENDS MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON TEXTBOOKS IN THE TERRACE. TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE COLLEGE TO. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF STUDENTS. SKIP BUYING THE REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS. AT SOME POINT THEIR COLLEGE CAREER. BECAUSE OF LACK OF AFFORDABILITY. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION HOW THEY ARE PASSING THOSE CLASSES. BUT WE OF SIXTY FIVE PERCENT IT'S ESTIMATED SKIP BUYING TEXTBOOKS FOR CLASSES. THIS BILL URGES PUBLISHERS OF TEXTBOOKS TO PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF. THE NEWEST EDITION OF A BOOK AND HOW IT CHANGES FROM THE OLD ADDITION. AND OUR HOPE IN DOING THIS IS TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY. SO THAT STUDENTS CAN BE ASSESSING AND. MEASURING WHETHER THEY NEED TO BUY THE NEW EDITION THE TEXTBOOK WHETHER THEY CAN GET BY WITH THE OLD ONE. I THINK IT'S GOING TO GIVE STUDENTS MORE CONCRETE INFORMATION AT ALL HELP. MARGINALLY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY WITH COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. NOW WITH THAT I JUST WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY TO STUDENT WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE TO GIVE A FIRST HAND PERSPECTIVE FROM CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. I BONTA MEDINA AND LINDSAY WALLACE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEDINA AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS LINDSAY WALLACE AND I'M A THIRD YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR AT CAL POLY ORIGINALLY FROM FRESNO CALIFORNIA. I HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON OUR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. OUR BILL LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM MENTIONED WOULD WORK TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT CHANGES MADE TEXTBOOK ADDITIONS. SO THAT STUDENTS CAN BETTER MAKE AN ECONOMICALLY SOUND DECISION WHEN PURCHASING BOOKS. AS A FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT COLLEGE STUDENT. I WORK PART TIME AND ATTEND SCHOOL FULL TIME. CURRENTLY I CANNOT AFFORD GAS AND GROCERIES WITHIN THE SAME WEEK. WHILE THE FORTY OR FIFTY DOLLARS SAVED ON BUYING OLDER TEXTBOOKS MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH. IT ADDS UP. IF YOU'RE TAKING FOR FIVE CLASSES A QUARTER THAT AMOUNTS TO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A QUARTER THAT YOU COULD BE SAVING. THAT MONEY COULD BE GROCERY ARE GAS FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH. OR A BIG CHUNK OF YOUR RENT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS. EVERY YEARS OCCURRING ONE IN TEN STUDENTS FACE THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE CSU SYSTEM ALONE. THAT MONEY IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORKING AN EXTRA EIGHTEEN HOURS. TO PAY FOR THE BOOKS OR SPENDING THOSE EIGHTEEN HOURS ACTUALLY READING THE TEXT BOOKS AND STUDYING. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE COST BENEFIT ANALYZERS BECAUSE THE INCREASINGLY HEFTY PRICE TAG OF COLLEGE FORCES US TO BE. AND THIS IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT STUDENTS WILL SEEK OUT THE INFORMATION. TEXTBOOK TRANSPARENCY THAT ARE BILL WOULD PROVIDE. THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE PUBLISHERS TO POST THE CHANGES MADE FROM ADDITION TO ADDITION A DECISION ON WHICH TEXTBOOK ADDITION TO PURCHASE. THEY CAN DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES IF THE NEWER VERSION IS VITAL. THE STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCES IF THERE ARE ANY AND THEN COMPARE THE COSTS. OUR BILL IS SIMPLY GIVING MORE POWER TO THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSUMER WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING TEXTBOOKS. THE STUDENTS. BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY WE CAN LOWER THE BURDEN OF PURCHASING TEXTBOOKS ON STUDENTS. WITH THE COST OF COLLEGE AT AN ALL TIM HIGH THIS IS A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COULD ULTIMATELY HELP COLLEGE STUDENTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SUCCEED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEDINA AN HONORABLE MEMBERS MY NAME IS IVANA MEDINA AND I'M A FOURTH YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR I PALPABLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. I'M HERE TODAY TO ADVOCATE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS A STUDENT I SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH QUARTER SEARCHING ONLINE MY TEXTBOOKS FOR THE QUARTER. AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING THAN GOING YOU SEEN MY TEXT. FOR THE LATEST ADDITION AND THEN SEEN THAT PREVIOUS A DUCK PREVIOUS EDITION OF A TEXTBOOK FOR LESS THAN HALF OF IT. OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY SOUND DECISION AND BUY THE CHEAPER EDITION OF A TEXTBOOK. BUT THEN I'M LEFT WONDERING IS THIS IS GOING TO HURT ME IN THE CLASSROOM SETTING. A MANY COULD SIX SIX FOUR SIX BE WILL GIVE STUDENTS A CHANCE TO MAKE REASONABLE DECISIONS WHEN PURCHASING TEXTBOOKS. STUDENTS CAN THEN ASK THEMSELVES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. IS OUR SUBSTANTIAL CLIENT CHANGE IN THE NEW ADDITION. WHAT PROBLEMS HAVE CHANGED? IS THE PRICE DIFFERENCE WORTH IT. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MENTION OF STUDENTS HAVING THIS RIGHT TO TRANSPARENCY AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS RIGHT UPS. BILL AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FIVE IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION OF TRANSPARENCY TO THE STUDENTS AS WELL AS EASY ACCESS TO INFORMATION. TEXT BOOKS I HAVE LITTLE TO NO EXPLANATION OF HOW THE ADDITION HAS BEEN CHANGED MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO DISTINGUISH IF THEY NEED THAT NEW LATEST ADDITION. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES ONLINE OF PUBLISHERS NOT THOROUGHLY DISCLOSING THIS INFORMATION. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME PUBLISHERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION AND SHOWING GREAT ADDITIONS FROM CHAPTER TO CHAPTER AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR ALL TEXTBOOKS ONLINE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND HONORABLE MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME'S CHASE DEAN AND I AM A FOURTH YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR FROM CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. OUR BILL AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FIVE THE STEP IN THE RIGHT FIGHT FOR AFFORDABILITY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. AS CURRENT LAW STAND STUDENTS ARE NOT MENTIONED AS INDIVIDUALS WERE GRANTED INFORMATION PERTAINING TO. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TEXTBOOKS DESPITE FACULTY IN THAT CONVERSATION. AB TWENTY THREE FIVE SIX TO PUT ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONSUMERS OF TEXTBOOKS STUDENTS FIRST. ARBIL CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER A STUDENT EATS OR PAYS RENT. STUDENTS ALREADY USE RESOURCES TO COMPARE TEXTBOOK PRICES SO GRANTED THIS INFORMATION TO STUDENTS WILL CERTAINLY BE OUR ALLIES. BY URGING PUBLISHERS TO DISPLAY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EDITIONS ON THEIR WEBSITE STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE INFORMATION. WHETHER THAT NEED WHETHER THEY NEED THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR TEXTBOOKS OR THE FIFTY DOLLAR PREVIOUS EDITION WILL SUFFICE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU.

TO CROSS REFERENCE IT TO THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH ALREADY HAS SOME SIMILAR PROVISIONS IN THE SAME OBJECTIVES AND AS WE NOTED IN OUR LETTER. WE CITED THE SECTION OF THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO WHAT THE WHAT THE. PROVISIONS IN STAKEHOLDER DOING ON BY CROSS REFERENCING IT TO THE FEDERAL LAW WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THERE'S CONSISTENCY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT ADOPTION. OF THE ROOTS OF. THE PROVISIONS OF BOTH THE STATE LAW IN THE FEDERAL LAW. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NINE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISS BAKER. THANK YOU HAVE. WHICH CAN HAVE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE AT ALL TO SEE OUR FORMER CALL A FORMER COLLEAGUE MISTER SASHA AND CONTINUING TO HELP STUDENTS SAID THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY UP HERE AND BEING A PART. OF THE HEARING AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE. YOUR BILL IS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS AND THE FEDERAL STANDARDS WOULD BE IF WE JUST CONFORM TO FEDERAL LAW. WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FULL. AMOUNT OF DISCLOSURE THAT'S MOST CRITICAL TO GET TO FOR THE STUDENTS. IS IS THAT CORRECT OR IS THERE IN MY NOT RIGHT ABOUT THAT THAT'S RIGHT DID AND TWO COMMENTS IN RESPONSE THAT VERY QUESTION THE FIRST IS THERE'S NO CALIFORNIA. LAW RIGHT NOW THAT COVERS THIS ISSUE IN THE FEDERAL LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL OF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE CHANGES. AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS TRY TO. DRIVE THE MARKET A POSITIVE WAY BY GIVING THE STUDENTS INFORMATION ABOUT. THE ARE THEY HAVE THEY REARRANGED COMMAS OR REARRANGE HOPE PARAGRAPHS FOR THEIR NEW CHAPTERS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED. TO THE COURSE MATERIAL THAT MIGHT BE SUBSTANTIVE AND THIS GOES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE WITNESS I THINK THIS BILL GOES A BIT FURTHER IN WHAT THE FEDERAL LAWS. IS REQUIRING RIGHT NOW THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT. MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE STUDENTS FOR FOR COMING. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING THIS ON AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS REALLY BEGINS TO BE A. AB AS THOROUGH IN DEEP AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THIS A PARADIGM TEXTBOOK CHANGED. WE LIVE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITALIZATION FOR LESS OF A REASONABLE LICENSING FEE TO GET SECTIONS OF TEXT BOOKS NECESSARY TO. TO TO GET THROUGH THE. THE PROGRAMS I I I MUST SAY THAT. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY UNDER THE PRESIDENCY DR CASTRO HAS TAKEN THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND HAVE SOME PILOT PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING SOME OF THAT. BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS. TO CONTINUE TO COME BEFORE US. TO GET THIS PARADIGM SHIFTED ARE. AM ALL I. GRADUATED FROM PRESENT STATE. ALL THROUGH MY KIDS WENT THERE MY HOPE MY GRANDKIDS ARE GOING TO GO THERE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS MOST SIGNIFICANT. HURDLE HERE IS THAT HUGE EXPENSIVE TEXTBOOKS AND OFTENTIMES THE. MY NEW. AMOUNT OF CHANGE THAT IS FROM ONE TEXTBOOK TO ANOTHER AND YET THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE TO PURCHASE. I THINK THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT. REALLY IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOME MODERNIZATION AND SOME SERIOUS REFORM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU IN THE STUDENTS ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND. MAKING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT DATA. NO ISSUE HOW WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR AND A LOT OF STUDENTS AND BE GRATEFUL THAT THIS IN FACT GIVES STUDENTS CHOICES AND OPTIONS THAT. MANAGE DOWNWARD THERE SPIRALING COSTS OF TEXTBOOKS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEN NINE CHIU CUNNINGHAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY. TO PIGGYBACK ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COMMENTS THIS IS I THINK A MODEST AND REASONABLE STEP INTO RIGHT DIRECTION OF INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN TRYING TO MODERNIZE. THE SYSTEM THAT IN SOME IN SOME WAYS. IS A LITTLE ANTIQUATED PERHAPS AND. I'D LOVE TO TAKE ALL THE CREDIT FOR THIS IDEA BUT IT WAS A STUDENT COLLABORATION WITH THE MY PREDECESSOR CACHO. VERY.

THANK YOU PROBLEM. SO WE'LL MOVE TO ITEM THREE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND WE ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENT. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL HAS THREE CORE TENANTS FIRST IMPROVES THE STATE'S STANCE TOWARDS THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN HOW IT MUST OPERATE. FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS FROM THE CONSUMER STATE REGULATIONS ON PESTICIDES WATER ENERGY SOIL AND WORKERS AND IN THE PAST TWO YEARS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN AVAILABLE WORKERS REGARDLESS OF WAGES AND OVERTIME. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL TAKES ACTION TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S INDUSTRIES WORKING RELATIONSHIP TODAY. IT EASES REGULATORY COMPLEX WITH THE CREATION OF A CDFA LED MULTI AGENCY REVIEW COUNCIL. TO IDENTIFY AND RECOMMEND RESOLUTION WHEN COMPLIANCE WITH ONE REGULATION. POTENTIALLY CREATES CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER IT FUNDS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SEE IF IT CDF PHASE INVASIVE PLANT AND PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. FUNDS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE CALIFORNIA GROWN MARKETING AGREEMENT. FIND TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO CDFA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CENTRALIZED AG BUSINESS PORTAL. AND REQUIRES THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO CAPTURE THE FARM TO FORK ECONOMIC IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE. SECOND IT CREATES A STATEWIDE AG INNOVATION PLATFORM. AG IN RURAL CALIFORNIA OR IF IN INTRINSICALLY INTERTWINED AND AND AS GO GOES AG SO GOES RURAL CALIFORNIA. I WANTED TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC CONDITION FOR RURAL RESIDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY AND I WAS THINKING INITIALLY WAS GOING TO BE ACT TOURISM. BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE AG INDUSTRY QUESTIONS ITS SURVIVAL IN THE STATE. AND THAT LEAVING WILL BE A DEATH BLOW TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AND TO EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. SO IT IS NOT ABOUT ACT TOURISM AT THE GROUND LEVEL IT'S ABOUT SAVING AG SO THERE CAN BE AG TOURS IN THE FUTURE. WE REALIZE THAT PROGRAMS LIKE SWEET AND HEALTHY SOILS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED TIMELY GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT IMPROVE AG PRACTICES. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEALTH CREATION IN RURAL AREAS THROUGH AG TECH ISRAEL IF CALIFORNIA CAPTURES ACT TECH FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL. AND IS HOME TO AG TECH INNOVATORS AND START UP COMPANIES IN A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE. IS THE BLUE REVELAR RIVER TECHNOLOGY PRECISION WEEDING THROUGH LASERS PROGRAM THAT WAS ACQUIRED BY JOHN DEERE FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THIS IS THIS IS PERCENT PRECISION WEEDING THAT. TAKES NO. HUMAN EFFORT. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AT BILL BRINGS BEST USES TOGETHER FOR A STATEWIDE PAT PLATFORM IT FINDS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOP THE AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION INSTITUTE AT CDFA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS MODELED OFF OF FOUR OTHER STATE CREATE INSTITUTES. TO IDENTIFY AND COMMERCIALIZE NASCENT TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES IT FUNDS TEN MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION TOUGH HIGHER AND RETRAIN COOPERATIVE EXTENSION EXPERT ADVISORS. AND IT PROVIDES INCENTIVE TAX CREDITS TO ADOPTERS OF AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY ONLY WHEN DEPLOYED ON PRODUCING HARVESTABLE ACRES WITH THE GOAL TO REDUCE ENERGY. WATER FERTILIZER PESTICIDE USE OR TO AUTOMATE PLANTING THINNING HARVESTING YOUR PRODUCTION SERVICES IT EXPANDS ON THE REGIONAL EFFORTS IN SALINAS FRESNO SAN LUIS OBISPO AND DAVIS. TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY INCUBATOR INCUBATORS AND ACCELERATORS AND IT CONDUCTS A STATEWIDE ON FARM BROADBAND SURVEY SO THAT STAKEHOLDERS CAN MAP OUT GAPS IN ABILITY TO A. ADOPT PRECISION AG TECH. IT CREATES A STATEWIDE PLATFORM THROUGH THE INSTITUTE AND THE TAX CREDIT WILL BRING VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDED COMPANIES BLOWING IN THE CALIFORNIA. WE DOMINATE OTHER TECH VERTICALS AND WE WE DOMINATE AG PRODUCTION WERE NOT STRUCTURED TO DOMINATE AG TECH. AND THIRD AND FINALLY IT PROVIDES FOR REAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY RECOVER ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS BEEN IN EVEN AND RHEA RURAL COMMUNITIES FEEL LEFT BEHIND. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE BAY AREA WITH JUST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POPULATION HAS GENERATED FORTY PERCENT OF THE JOB GROWTH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF HIGH WAGE JOB GROWTH HAS OCCURRED IN A HANDFUL OF ASSEMBLY DEPT DISTRICT CENTERED AROUND URBAN TECH CENTERS. SO THE FARM BILL. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BILL TRICK TRAINS RURAL CALIFORNIA YOUTH FOR FARMS OF THE FUTURE IT CREATES SMART FARMS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE AG TECH SHOWCASES AND REAL WORLD CAREER PACKED. IT ENCOURAGES AG TECH COURSEWORK EXPANSION TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THE AG TECH INNOVATION INSTITUTE WILL VET AND APPROVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CREDIT WORTHY. OPERATORS WILL HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED ON THE ACRES IN PRODUCTION WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'M A LOT OF THE ACTIVE. TECH THAT'S BEEN CREATED HAS BEEN CREATED BY INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE NO COMMITTEE. NO CONNECTION TO AGRICULTURE AND SO EACH COMMODITY EACH OP PRODUCT THAT'S GOING TO CALIFORNIA. HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS DIFFERENT SOIL NEEDS DIFFERENT WATERY NEEDS AND SO THIS. INSTITUTE WILL BE PERFECTLY POISED TO TEST THESE MASON TECHNOLOGIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO WORK. JOBS ON THE FARM WILL CHANGE THE CURRENT FARMWORKERS OVER FIFTY FIVE IN THE LABOR POOL IS FINE EIGHT NOW FEWER JOBS ARE IN THE FIELD BUT THEY WILL BE IN A. IN A OF A DIFFERENT NATURE HIGHER PAYING ABLE TO MANAGE IN IN A GREAT WITH TECHNOLOGY. IT WILL RESULT IN THE RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL IN RURAL CALIFORNIA THEY WON'T HAVE TO MOVE TO THE SILICON FOR VALLEY TO WORK AT THAT. TECH IN AG TECH AND THE RETURN OF TECH START UP EXECUTIVES TO RURAL ROOTS LIKE MEGAN NEWNESS OF INSIGHT WHO MOVED BACK TO GUSTINE AFTER TEN YEARS IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. APPLYING HER TECH EXPERIENCE TO OUR HOME DOWN INDUSTRIES NEEDS WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY. SIX OUR CLINIC CAO CAO DIDN'T DEAN OF THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FROM PART NOW COLLEGE. I GLENN IF YOU MISSED AND VICE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT OF YOU SEE AND ARE NANCY WOULD GET AS AGRICULTURE WATER AND ENVIRONMENT. AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY SECTOR NAVIGATOR RETHINK COMMUNITY COLLEGE THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS GLENDA HUMUS DENY SERVICE VICE PRESIDENT OF BAGAN NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ARE SPEAKING TODAY IS AN EXPERT WITHIN MY FIELD IN A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL NOT AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF YOU SEE. A IN OUR SERVICES THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARM FOR THE UC SYSTEM AND PROVIDES LEADERSHIP FOR UC'S FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES AS A LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY. THIS INCLUDES COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS. WE SERVE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTS OF CALIFORNIA WORKING CLOSELY WITH FARMERS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION AND DELIVER SOLUTIONS IN A WIDE ARRAY OF DISCIPLINES. OUR COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS FURTHERMORE COORDINATE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS THROUGH FOR H. MASTER GARDENER MASTER FOOD PRESERVER AND THE CALIFORNIA NATURALIST PROGRAMS. YOU SEE A IN OUR COOP COLLABORATES WITH ALL TEN UC CAMPUSES. THE CSU SYSTEM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES NONPROFITS THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. IT'S TRUE THAT THE NUMBER OF COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS HAVE FALLEN DRASTICALLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. WITH DRAMATIC BUDGET CUTS TO YOU SEE DURING THE NINETIES RECESSION AND THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ECONOMIC CRISIS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT HALF AS MANY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISORS AND SCIENTISTS THAT WE HAD TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. SOME OF THIS IS BECAUSE A IN OUR IS A DIVISION WITHIN THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND AS THE UC OP BUDGET IS CUT IT AFFECTS FUNDING FOR FOR AGING COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. THE FUNDING IN AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX WOULD PROVIDE ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE NEW SCIENTIST ALLOWING US TO TARGET SOME OF THE SEVERE CHALLENGES WE CURRENTLY FACING CALIFORNIA. DROUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE INVASIVE SPECIES NATURAL DISASTERS AND MORE. THAT SAID I MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE YOU SEE DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW. IN CLOSING WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUBBY EURO SUPPORT AND INTEREST IN REBUILDING CALIFORNIA'S COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME COME MY NAME IS CLINT CAO THEN THE DEAN OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HARTNELL COLLEGE IN SALINAS. I'VE BEEN IN THE AG TECH SPACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO BOTH. SPENT OVER TEN YEARS OUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WEST HILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TEACHING PRECISION AGRICULTURE AN INTEGRATION. OF GPS AND GIS INTO THE CURRICULUM WHERE WE'RE AT THAT SAME TIME HARTNELL AS IT HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE US. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL IS WHEN WE LOOK AT IT IT PUTS IN PERSPECTIVE WHAT A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS. AND HOW WE CAN REALLY SOLVE A LOT OF OUR EQUITY ISSUES AND SO IN A TYPICAL AG TECH CLASSROOMS GONNA WALK IN A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS ARE YOU HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE. THEY'RE COMING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR UP SKILLS AND FOCUS ON THE SPECIALTY CROPS ON THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND HOW TO INTEGRATE THAT TECHNOLOGY. A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS ARE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THEY'RE EXCITED THEY WANNA LEARN ANYONE INTEGRATE THIS TYPE OF THING. THE OTHER THIRD OF THE STUDENTS ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NONTRADITIONAL THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS ARE COMING BACK AND GETTING RETOOLED AND WANTING TO GET IN INTO THE MARKET THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS BILL. IS GOING TO BRING A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER SO WE CAN GO TO THAT ONE PLACE AND FIND SOME OF THIS GREAT. TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN PUT INTO OUR STUDENTS HANDS. AND AND TRULY HAVE IT BE ACTIONABLE IN OUR IN OUR AREA THERE WAS A CONVERSATION THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DUPLICATIVE. OF THE TNC. PROCESS OUT THERE THIS IS ACTUALLY THAT IN ADDITION TO AND SO WE ARE VERY EXCITED SO PARTNER. HARTNELL IS A VERY EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. OTHER WOULD. WORK. SO WE WE WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. TWO MINUTES WEEK WE HAD THAT NOW WE'RE GOING TO WITNESSES OVER HERE. AARON DRIVER IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE THE GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION EIGHT FARMERS FOR ASSOCIATION PACIFIC EGG AND POULTRY PEAR GROWERS BEING SHIPPERS. WHEAT GROWERS SEEDS AND WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATION THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS ROBERT OR FROM THE LOCAL GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL WEST HILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT COALINGA THE MORE FIREBAUGH. WITH THE STUDENT BODY IS TWO THIRDS DISADVANTAGED WE'RE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND VIEW IT IS OF THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. NANCY GOOD TEARS I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND I REPRESENT AND THE SIXTY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE AG NATURAL RESOURCES. AYE DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AND WE ON SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANY TWO WINNERS. JEANNIE MERRILL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE IN AGRICULTURE NETWORK WHERE A COALITION OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGETIC AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONS AND FORMER GROUPS. WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE A CALIFORNIA FARM BILL. BEING DISCUSSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND SUPPORTIVE OF. AS SPECIALLY HAVING MORE RESOURCES FOR COOPER EXTENSION IS BADLY NEEDED WE'D LIKE TO SEE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO INCLUDE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD. FOR MANY FARMERS AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PIECE TO REALLY EMBRACE OTHER CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT. CLIMATES WHERE AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SKILLED OF FARMWORKER CREW PATHWAYS THANKS. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION STILL A TWEENER SORRY. A COUPLE TOWERS WITH PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK HE AND ON BEHALF OF A HANDFUL OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHARED SOME CONCERNS THE AUTHORS OFFICE WHICH WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AND THANK THEM FOR THAT. AND THINK THE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING A BIG SWING AT A AT A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AYE THIS BILL CONTAINS AN AWFUL LOT AND IT WHICH WE APPRECIATE. YEAH BEHALF OF SOME THE FARM WORKER ROLE COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH AYE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THESE PATHWAYS IN CONSIDERING PATHWAYS FOR ALL CHILDREN FARMWORKERS WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR AG EXTENSION FOR YOU SEE AND OUR ADVISORS. AND MUCH LIKE THE COMMENTS FROM MY THE PERSON BEFORE ME WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY. AND PRACTICES IN A BLACK PRACTICES IN CONSERVATION PROVIDING CLEAR DIRECTION FOR BODIES CLIMATE SMART FARMS IN THE ACT TECH INSTITUTE TO MOVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THAT DIRECTION THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA HAD. YOU THINK ANY WHICH IS IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS DOCTOR WEB. I JUST A QUICK THIS IS A. THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. AND WHAT WERE AUTHORIZING THE. COMMUNICATIVE DEVELOPING. A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IRAQ CORRECT IT NOW THEY ALREADY HAVE A A AD CURRICULUM HOW DOES THIS INTERFACE WITH THAT. AND. IN MAY IN MAYBE I CAN HAVE THAT SOME OF THE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOT STAFF IF YOU WANNA AT HAVE A DETAILED ANALYSIS BUT THE IDEA IS THAT. DID THE THAT CAREER TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT NOW DOESN'T THAT FOR THEIR VERY. IT INFORMALLY MANY OF THE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE TO ARE INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY INTO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WEST TELLS HAS A SMART FARM WHERE THEY'VE DEPLOYED A A NUMBER OF. AT OF THE TECHNOLOGY TYPES IN ORDERED IT TO TEACH THEIR STUDENTS BUT WE THINK IT OUGHT TO BE CURRICULUM BASED AND WE REALLY THINK THAT IT OUGHT TO BE. THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SAME KIND OF CURRICULUM ALL OVER THE STATE. AND SO WHAT WHAT. MY VISION OF IT IS IS THAT IT'S IT'S THE ABILITY TO HAVE. YOU SEE A IN OUR. LOOKING AT DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TEACHING. THEY'RE. THEY'RE. TECH AG PEOPLE WHAT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE AND THEN USING THEM ALSO DOWN IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY THAT HAS A BETTER EXPLANATION OF HOW THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORKS. THAT'S THAT'S ALL THANKS FOR ASKING ACT I WAS THAT DON'T WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE WITH THE AND THE C. ID. WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS TRANSFERRING AND AND SO ACT WE ORIGINALLY WERE GOING TO GET ONLY ONE PATHWAY. AND THAT MANY OF OUR UNIVERSITIES THAT THAT SIXTEEN DIFFERENT MAJORS AND SO WE WERE VERY HAPPY THAT WE GOT THREE BUT WITHIN THOSE THREE PLANT SCIENCE ANIMAL SCIENCE BAG BUSINESS. THEY DON'T HAVE A FOCUS ON. TECHNOLOGY AND SO ONE OF THE THE COMPONENTS HERE IS FOR STUDENT THAT GOES THROUGH A TNC PROCESS. BUT DOESN'T TRANSFER TO UNIVERSITY DO THEY HAVE THOSE THOSE TECHNOLOGY SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO LAND A JOB. AND THIS WOULD THIS WOULD INCREASE THAT. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS DOES IT GO TO ALL THE CAMPUS SO SUGGEST CERTAIN CAMPUSES. YES AND THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE AND AT ITS THOSE CAMPUSES THAT OFFER DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AND AGONIZE RESOURCES AND SO THE SEE EDDIE ALSO IS BASICALLY A MODEL SO THAT EACH CAMPUS HAS THE SAME. COURSE WORK. AND THEY ARE ALIGNED STATEWIDE SO THAT THERE'S NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE TWO BETWEEN ALL THE CAMPUSES THAT OFFER IT BUT YES THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE. AND THEY CAN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A CURRICULUM THOUGH THAT THEY PRESENT AN ACT CURRICULUM DON'T THEY HAVE ONE I WAS READING ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT THE COMMUTER COLLEGE OF THIS OF. THAT ALL OF THEM USE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE AG PROGRAMS THEY ALREADY HAVE A PROGRAM UNTIL YOU ADDING IS A TECHNOLOGY. SO RIGHT NOW SO WHAT EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE THERE ARE MANY DISCIPLINES BUT THEN AGAN AFTER RESOURCES PROGRAM FORCED TO NOT RESOURCES AG BUSINESS. IN TERMS OF THEIR COURSE IDENTIFICATION TRANSFER MODEL CURRICULUM THERE ARE JUST THREE AG BUSINESS PLANT SCIENCE AND ANIMAL SCIENCE SO THIS I DON'T THINK IT'S EXACTLY DOES A CREATE A TRANSFER MODEL CURRICULUM. BUT MODEL CURRICULUM FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY IN AG TECHNOLOGY SO WHILE THERE IS EDUCATION GOING ON IN AB TECHNOLOGY WHAT THERE IS NOT IS CONFIRMED STATEWIDE ALIGNMENT IN THE ACT TECHNOLOGY. AND AND IF. I CAN INTERJECT AYE AYE. I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS NOT TAKING A POSITION FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THEY HAVE NO POSITION. COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND. THERE HAVE BEEN NEXT CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE COMMUNICATIVE ACADEMIC SAID. IN ANY OTHER QUESTION MISTER PATTERSON. JUST TAKE A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT WEST HILLS COMMUNICATIVE KNOW THEM WELL. IN OUR AREA. WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN THAT AREA INNOVATIVE LEAD NOT ONLY IN THIS BUT IN ALL KINDS OF OTHER AREAS IS REALLY REMARKABLE I'M WANTED TO COMMEND YOU FOR IT AND JUST? SUGGEST MY COLLEAGUES AT WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING HERE REALLY DOES WORK GOTTA. ON THE SITE IN THE IN THE REGION. AND I THINK WOULD HAVE TERRIFIC ADVANTAGE UP AND DOWN THE STATE'S APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD MEMBERS WELL THANK YOU. DISCOVER YOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS AND AND THE. THE QUESTIONS. I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. ACT TOURS. OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS AND TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED TREMENDOUSLY IN THIS LAST TWO YEARS THE ACTORS THAT I'VE DONE. HAVE BEEN IT I BEEN ASTONISHED AT THAN THE AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING USED ON. IN AYE DAIRY FARMS IN EGG PRODUCTION IN. CITRUS PRODUCTION IN NOT PRODUCTION HOME IF WE DON'T. GET OUR WORK FORCE RETRAIN THOSE WORKERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN THE FIELD. OR WE DON'T TRAIN OUR YOUNG YOUNGER WORKERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN AGRICULTURE WERE GOING TO END UP WITH A RICK GET REAL LACK OF TALENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPS ARE CREATED SO THAT THE. THE DRIP IRRIGATION IS PLACED ACCURATELY AND WEEK THAT THEY CAN BE READ OFF A PHONE AND THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE SO THAT THESE FORMS OF THE FUTURE CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE SO. THIS BILL STARTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETRAIN OUR WORKFORCE AND SO. ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. NOT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND WHILE I AGREE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR INNOVATIVE AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE HUGE REVENUE AND TAXATION. IMPLICATIONS IN THIS BILL SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. TO ADDRESS THE REVENUE AND. TAXATION IMPLICATIONS.

MY COCA COLA THROUGH IT THAT MISTER GRAYSON AND THEN DOCTOR WEBER WHO LOOKED IN STATE SEATED OVER THERE SHE SAID JOB SO TROOPS. HAD GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY WERE VERY PLEASED TO BE WITH YOUR TO YOU TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE. A HIGHER EDUCATION FACILITIES BOND ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS BOND WOULD GENERATE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES AN IMPROVEMENT TO EXISTING FACILITIES. HISTORICALLY BONTA BEEN USED TO FIND LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BOTH K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER ED. THIS FUNDING FOR PROJECTS TO THE BUDGET HAS FAILED TO KEEP PACE WITH THE NEED THIS ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT RECENT BOND MEASURES. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE VOTERS PASSED PROPERTY ONE AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS BOND FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE ALSO NEED TO REST AND THE REST OF OUR SYSTEM. NOT ONLY OR CURRENT FACILITIES LACKING NECESSARY MAINTENANCE. BUT OUR SYSTEM IS ALSO TURN AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS I TALK TO A PROFESSOR THIS WEEKEND FROM C. ISSUE SAN FRANCISCO. WHO TALKED ABOUT A THE ELEVATOR SHE COULDN'T GET OUT OF IT SOMETIMES TO BE ABLE TO TEACH A CLASS? SHE SAID SHE CRIED OUT I* GET THROUGH THE WORLD WAR TWO WILL NEVER GET TO CIVIL RIGHTS AS YOU COULD HARDLY GET ON THE ELEVATOR TRYING TO GET TO CLASS ON TIME. AND WE'RE EXTREMELY TENS OF THOUSANDS STUDENTS THIRTY ONE STYLE THOUSAND STUDENTS THIS YEAR DID NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEATS FOR THEM TO SIT IN. WE ARE PROJECTED TO FALL MILLIONS OF GRADUATE SHORT OF THE JOB MARKET NEED BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE MUST EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THE NEEDS ALL OVER THE STATE OF CONTINUE TO GROW. ESPECIALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE IS THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO. THE COASTAL AREA MORE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO AND YET WE HAVE A DEARTH OF FACILITIES. THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT FACILITIES LIKE MINE WITH LARGE POPULATIONS. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WITHIN FIFTY MILES. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MEET FUTURE NEEDS WE HAVE TO EXPAND EXISTING SCHOOLS AND INVEST IN NEW CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION. WE WENT A WHOLE GENERATION PASSING THE THESE BONDS FOR EVERY TWO TO FOUR YEARS BUT IT'S NOW BEEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE WE PASSED. A HIGHER EDUCATION BOND. THIS BONTA PUT THE DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF THE VOTERS WHO HAVE CONSISTENTLY AGREED THAT WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THIS REALLY IS OUR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE IT'S GONE LAYING OUT A PATH FOR CALIFORNIA BILL TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS TO MEET OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND MAKE SURE OUR FACILITIES HAVE A. THAT THAT REFLECT BLOOD THAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MISTER GRAYSON ALSO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COPE PRESENT TODAY. AND IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO JOINT AUTHORED WITH DOCTOR WEBER DOCTOR EGGMAN. BY THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL DOCTOR EGGMAN IS ALREADY PRESENTED AND WELL ARTICULATED. AND. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE NEED OF THIS BILL. I HAVE AND WILL SIMPLY ADD THAT I HAVE TALKED WITH SPOKE WITH CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS SET IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. LISTENING TO THE CASE AS TO WHY THIS BILL WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE CAMPUSES OF CS USE AND UC'S ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE YOU SEE. BERKELEY WHO HOLDS CLASSES THAT ARE PACKED OUT AND THERE WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING AND NO ABILITY TO CIRCULATE AIR. AND THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE WHERE IT'S WARMING UP. IS CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR WERE CLASSES ARE MAXIMIZED. DO THIS. STATE TO THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WITH YOU SEE NCS USE THEY HAVE CLEARLY. LAID OUT THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT TO EXISTING CAMPUSES CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AND. THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR FUTURE DEMANDS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ATTENDANCE OF STUDENTS. CALISTO ROOMS FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS HAVE ALL SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE SO I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT ASKED WHAT I VOTERS WILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SHOT BEHALF OF THE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FACULTY COUNSELORS LIBRARIANS AND STOP OF THE CUT CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS NOTED BY THE MEMBERS SPEED DEFINITELY HAVE. A GREAT NEED OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS FOR NEW FACILITIES SO WE. I THINK THE AUTHORS FOR THIS MEASURE THINKS ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE DO APPRECIATE SINCERELY. THE AUTHORS UGLINESS PUSHED ISSUE FORWARD THE NEEDS ARE GREAT AS NOTED YOUR ANALYSIS UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OTHER NEEDS AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARY MOYLE WITH THE CSU WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. AYE WE ALSO HAVE HAVE A LOT OF NEED IS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT GETTING STUDENTS RELIABLE FACILITIES SO THANK THANK YOU. JERRY DUSA CAL STATE SOON ASSOCIATION AND TRUNK SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. TWEETERS. IT WAS IN OPPOSITION. YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BUT WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS REGARDING BONDS IN GENERAL. MEMBERS BONDS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD. AND THERE IS A PROPER AND APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR CAPITAL FACILITIES BONDS HOWEVER I THINK THERE'S A HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO BEFORE YOU LOOK AT APPROVING MORE BOND AT AND I DON'T THINK THIS BOND. YOU KNOW AT THIS SPECIFIC ITERATION DOES THAT YET SO WE HAVE TO BE OPPOSE. THINGS THAT YOU KNOW JUST STAND OUT THAT I WOULD MENTION CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW HAS A DEBT SERVICE RATIO OF ABOUT FIVE PERCENT THAT'S FIVE PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THAT GOES TO NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN PAYING OFF ON DAD. NOW CAN BE DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT THAT NUMBER IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW. BUT. WHEN YOU THINK OF PRISONS WHEN YOU THINK OF KICK YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION WHEN YOU THINK OF PENSIONS WHEN YOU THINK OF OTHER FUNDING PRIORITIES AND ESPECIALLY WITH A NINE BILLION DOLLAR PROP FIFTY ONE K. TWELVE BOND THAT JUST PASSED. LAST NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW WE HAD A GOVERNOR THAT AT ONE TIME WAS REALLY REALLY FOCUSED ON A WALL OF DEBT AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S PULLING BACK FROM THAT A LITTLE BIT. BUT AGAIN WE ALSO DO YOU HAVE THESE ONGOING GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. BEYOND THAT NUMBER TWO I THINK WHEN ANALYZING A BLIND WE DO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. LIKE PROP FIFTY ONE SOME OF THE BONDS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THIS ONE YOU KNOW BONDS LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THERE IS MEMBERS KNOW PRIORITY WITHIN OUR BOND SYSTEM ABOUT PRIORITIZING WHICH BONDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT. IS A HIGHER EDUCATION BOND MORE IMPORTANT IMPROPER FIFTY ONE IS IT MORE IMPORTANT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL THERE ARE NO THE TREASURE HAS ATTEMPTED TO. ATTEMPT TO TRY AND ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT THERE'S NONE OF THAT IN PLACE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES ARE MORE IMPORTANT ANOTHER BONDS AND IF THESE OTHER PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO CROWD AND TERRY DEBT SERVICE RATIO. AND AS WE PREPARE TO ENTER INTO ANOTHER RECESSION WHICH IS INEVITABLE THOSE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. AND YOU KNOW FINALLY. PROPER AND APPROPRIATE USE OF BONDS IS TO FUND PROJECTS THAT LAST THE LENGTH OF THE BLIND. SO PRIMARILY MAJOR CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT LIFE CYCLE COSTS ARE APPROPRIATE YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE BOND DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE IS WHAT ALL US POSSIBLE. DEFINED IPHONES IPADS EITHER DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ORDER FUN FURNITURE BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO LAST A LINK TO THE BOND LIFE CYCLE COSTS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND MEMBERS NONE OF THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED YOU KNOW WHEN LOOKING AT THIS BOND OR FRANKLY A LOT OF OTHER BONDS AND SO. IT'S MORE JUST PREVIOUS OVER OUR KING REASONS AND NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE BOND ITSELF THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THIS BAKER. BECAUSE I THINK YOU MEMBERS THAT A MAN AND GRAYSON FOR. FOR BRINGING FOR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN FACILITIES WE VISITED ABOUT THIS I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE BONDS FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT THE REPRESENTED SOME HOWARD JARVIS OF POINTED OUT IF WE. IF WE IT'S A IT'S A MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES WHICH BUT WE DO IN OUR BUDGET BECAUSE IF WE SPEND IT. WITHOUT ISSUING A BOND WE ARE PREVENTING FUTURE BUDGETS BEING CROWDED OUT BY IST INTEREST. SO I LOOK AT WITH THE VERY SKEPTICAL I BONDS WHEN THEY COME BEFORE ME. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS ONE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO BE INVESTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE VOTE VALID POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED PARTICULARLY MAKING SURE IF YOU CAN AND MAKE PRIORITIES IN THIS THAT IT IS. LONG TERM CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL LAST NOT STILL HAVE FOR THE BOND THAT PERHAPS EVEN LONGER. HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BUT. IN AND SECONDLY. AN ISSUE WAS NOT RAISED BUT YOU KNOW I SUPPORTED THE FACILITIES VON FOUR KEY THROUGH FOURTEEN AND FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRICKLING OUT THOSE DOLLARS WHICH I THINK IS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE WILL. OF CALIFORNIANS WHO VOTED FOR IT OVERWHELMINGLY. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CLOSE ANY. LOOPHOLES RUN ALL THE TRAPS TO MAKE SURE THAT A GOVERNOR CANNOT UNILATERALLY REWRITE WHEN THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. BECAUSE ONCE WE'VE MADE A DECISION AS AS A LEGISLATURE TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTERS TO CONTINUE VOTE YES ON THIS THAT YOU MAY NOT SUPPORT IT WHEN IT'S ON THE BALLOT THAT YOU WANNA GET ON THERE. BUT ONCE IT'S ON THERE THAT THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS IS HONORED AND SO THAT'S A CAUTIONARY WORD GIVEN THE WHAT WE WHAT WE'RE SEEING HAPPEN RIGHT NOW WITH THE SCHOOL FACILITIES BOND AND WHAT IT'S DOING TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO ARE BASICALLY AWAITING A RETURN OF LOANS THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY MADE TO THE STATE AND TO TRY TO REALLY MAKE SURE THIS GOES TO LONG TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENT OUTLAYS? I THINK THAT MAKES IT A MUCH MORE LEGITIMATE CASE IN AN IDEAL WORLD. WE WE SET OUR PRIORITIES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY SO MUCH ON DEBT THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE IN TIMES FOR BONDS AND I THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT CASE. WITH SOMEBODY'S CORRECTIONS THANK YOU SUB REPORT SUPPORTING TODAY LOOKING FOR IT HOPING THOSE. IMPROVEMENTS. BUT YOU WILL BE. I THINK IS AS ALWAYS MISTER WILL MAKE SOME VERY SALIENT POINTS BUT I WOULD HATE TO BE OUTFLANKED ON THE LEFT BY MS BAKER. SO I'LL BE AYE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IS WELL. I I THINK WHEN WE WE KIND OF THINK GLOBALLY IN LONG TERM IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I APPRECIATE MY SPEAKERS POINTS. THAT. YEAH WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF THE DISTANT HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT THE WHAT THE PHYSICAL NEEDS THE CAPITAL NEEDS ARE FOR THOSE SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS THE SKILL BUILDING NEEDS TO CAREER. NEEDS IN ANY JOB. THE PROSPECT OF JOBS AS WELL AND WHERE THEY WOULD BE AND THEN THE TYPE OF. COUPLE WE WE NEED TO BUILT TO SUPPORT ALL OF THAT AND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER THEY SHOULD GO IN BUT I THINK THAT WE WOULD NEED THE SEGMENTS TO BE. PART OF THAT PLANNING TO TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DOLLARS THAT WE NEED AND ALSO WHERE THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE MADE WHICH I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR. DOCTOR WEBER. YES I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON EGGMAN IN GRAYSON FOR. FOR US GETTING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THIS SUB PARTICULAR BILL. UP MOST OF YOU KNOW WE'VE TRIED MULTIPLE WAYS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE C. ISSUE. THEN YOU SUCH SHORTAGE IN TERMS OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT. MANY OF YOU HAVE PUT TOGETHER RESOLUTIONS TO A BASICALLY BUILD NEW CAMPUSES ONLY TO HAVE THAT EITHER DERAILED BY THE GOVERNOR OR SOMEBODY. WE'VE TRIED THE. THE. THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHER IT ORGANIZATION THAT USED TO HAVE A MAP OUT THINGS FOR US AND PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND THAT HAS NOT. A SOMEONE'S TRIED THAT FOR THE LAST SIX USING EACH YEAR IT'S BEEN DITA IT'S BEEN VETOED SO. THIS IS AN EFFORT TO REALLY START LOOKING FORWARD. PROBABLY OF ALL THE THINGS THAT A BOND COULD DO THAT MIGHT LAST IN TERMS OF LONGER THAN THE. PLAYBACK OF OF OF OF OF THE OF THE BOND ITSELF IS UNIVERSITY. I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE UNIVERSITIES THAT DIE OUT IN THE AGENCY ISSUE pCALLED IS THE DOUBT IN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. MOST OF THEM EXPAND AND GROW IN A MOST ARE UNIVERSES OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD NOW I THINK IRVINE WAS THE LAST ONE JUST TURNED FIFTY OR SAN MARCOS ONE. TURN TWENTY FIVE SO THEY GENERALLY LAST THEY LAST LONGER THAN THAN MOST THINGS AND SO IT THAT SINCE HE BECOMES VERY GOOD INVESTMENT. OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WILL LAST LONGER THAN JUST PAYING BACK THE BOND TO BUY IPADS AND THINGS THAT CHANGE. THE UNIQUE THING TOO IS THAT YOU KNOW OF THE SYSTEMS WHICH NORMALLY DON'T COOPERATE ALL THE TIME TOGETHER ARE REALLY IN COOPERATION WITH THIS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE A UC CAMPUS THE CHANCELLOR OF THIS A C. ISSUE HAVE ALL WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. BECAUSE THEY TOO ARE EXPERIENCING THE FACT THAT WE ARE REVVING UP EVERYBODY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY SAY WE GETTING THEM READY. TO GO SOMEWHERE MOVES LIKE WHEN THEY GET READY TO GET ON THE ON RAMP OF THE FREE WEIGHTS THIS ISSUE OF THE UC AND THERE'S NO ROOM. AND SO AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT MORE AND MORE OF OUR STUDENTS NEEDING TO GET AN A A DEGREE OR SOMETHING AND THEN HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ON. WE HAVE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO DO IT AND OUR SYSTEMS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THAT BUT UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING TO BUILD MORE. OF CAMPUSES WILL THEN FIND OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN WITH AS WE DO THIS YEAR OVER THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A SLOT. IN EITHER ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE AND. THAT WILL ONLY GROW AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. THE OTHER EXPANDING OUR CURRICULUM GETTING MORE OF OUR STUDENTS INTO THE UNIVERSITY WE'RE TALKING EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID ALL THOSE THINGS AS INCENTIVES FOR STUDENTS TO GO. AND GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL POST SECONDARY AND. AND YET WE ARE NOT THINKING IN TERMS OF EXPANSION OF THOSE CAMPUSES WE HAVE A WHAT WE CALL EDUCATION DEBTS IN THE STATE. WHERE THERE ARE NO CAMPUSES ALMOST THE ISSUE NO UC CAMPUS? AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS IS AB AS OUR POPULATION GROWS AND WE EXPAND BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE. OF STUDENTS WERE WORKING CLASS STUDENTS NOW WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH WHAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WAS DESIGNED FOR. OF MANY OF THEM CAN GOING TO FOR THE GOAL OF VACANCY AT HOME. BUT THEY CAN'T STAY AT HOME BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THERE ARE NO SEE ISSUES AND NO UC'S AND WE HAVE SOME PLACES LIKE THAT. THEN THE COST OF ONE COLLEGE WITH THEM BECOMES EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. WE WANT TO CREATE A GREAT TAXPAYERS IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO GOOD JOBS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT GOOD JOBS THAT THIS THAT THAT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO THIS IS REALLY A FORWARD LOOKING EFFORT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. AYE AS WELL ENTERING HOPEFULLY A NEW CYCLE OF OF LEADERSHIP IN AND AND CALIFORNIA WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR. AND SOME OTHERS TO START TALKING ABOUT PLANNING IN THIS IS DESIGNED TO DO THAT TO REALLY HELP TO EXTRACT AND BUILD OUR CAMPUSES. I CANCERS ARE CONCERNED SOME OF THE OTHER BECOMING OBSOLETE IN THEIR LABS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO. ALSO WE RESPONSIBILITY WE TAKE PRIDE WE BRAG ABOUT OUR THREE TWO SYSTEM AND IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. BUT IT WILL NOT REMAIN THAT WAY UNLESS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IT AND SO I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS AND I TO MOVE AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE. SECOND. ANY OTHER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER JOBS QUESTIONS GARMENTS. IT WAS. TODAY I WAS TALKING TO A. TWO STUDENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY. OF SAN DIEGO. AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THE STORIES IN THE SUB TO MEETING ABOUT THE INABILITY OF THE STUDENTS. TO TAKE THEIR CLASSES THEY NEED TO GET OUT WITHIN FOUR YEARS. AND A LOT OF TIME JUST BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE CLASSROOMS IN THERE TO GET A MINUTE. THEY ALSO TALK TO THE STUDENTS OR STAND. THERE. THERE IN ROOMS THAT ARE LARGE ENOUGH FOR THE STUDENTS SO THEY HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BRING TABLES AND CHAIRS AND. THE UC'S SYSTEM. IS THE INNOVATOR. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAVE DIFFERENT REGIONS WITHIN THE STATE. IT MAKES MONEY. AND THE ABILITY OF GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE IN AND OUT FOR YEARS. SAVES US MONEY VERSUS TAKEN SIX YEARS TO GET OUT. NOW THE SHE ISSUES ARE ALL AROUND THE STATE AND THEY DO WONDERFUL JOBS. SOME TO LIKE IN MY OWN HISTORY. SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE GRADUATES ACCOUNT STANCE A CAL STATE SAN MARCOS STAY WITH TO MY DISTRICT. AND ARE MAKING BUSINESSES IN THE NBA'S IN THEM GRAYSON QUALITY. ECONOMY AND ACTUALLY NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO WOODS OVER A MILLION PEOPLE NOW. IS COMPETING WITH SAN DIEGO FOR OPPORTUNITY JOBS. BECAUSE OF CSU SAN MARCOS. TO ME THIS JUST MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AS FAR AS WHAT DO WE AS A SOCIETY INVEST IN. AND THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S WE NEED THESE INSTITUTIONS. NOW I'M ALL FOR BE IN A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE EVERYTHING ELSE MIGHT INVESTING. IN. INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH HAS A MUCH LONGER LIFE CYCLE THAN THIRTY YEARS. AND INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE NEW JOBS IS A SMART THING TO DO. SO ONLY BE REAL CLEAR I'M GLAD THIS IS HERE. CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED FOR UC'S GARCIA ISSUES. AND. HOPE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A DAMN THING SO PROBABLY THAT'S WHY SECOND. NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE SEGMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WOODS AT THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR COMMENTS IN THEIR OF THEIR THOUGHTFULNESS AND I. YOU KNOW IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT ARE PART DEBT RATING IS IS GOOD RIGHT NOW. FITS STANDARD POOR'S AND MOODY'S ALL PRAISE US FOR OUR OUR RIGHT DIVERSE ECONOMIC PORTFOLIO. OR DEBT RATIO IS DOWN RIGHT NOW. AND ITS PEOPLE SAID THERE'S GOOD DEBT AND THERE'S BAD DEBT. I THINK INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND WE TALK ABOUT THE LIFE OF A BOND. THE CAMPUSES WILL LAST BUT THE STUDENTS THAT WE EDUCATE IN THOSE CAMPUSES WILL LAST EVEN LONGER AND PROVIDE FOR THE. ECONOMIC SECURITY OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL. SO WE WE HAVE HAD A MOTION. WE NEED A MOTION. I PSYCHOLOGY MOVE BY DOCTOR WEBER SECOND BY MISTER CHAVEZ. AND I SHOULD SAY MISTER LACKEY IS ALSO A CO AUTHOR. I I I HEARD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IN THE PRESENTATION. AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE NEED OF YOU SEE AND CSU. NEEDING MORE FACILITIES THAT'S BEEN OBVIOUS TO ME AS CHAIR OF HIGHER ED AS I. A TOUR SAC STATE AS I SPEND TIME ON CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT IS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HISTORICALLY RESPECTED THE SEGMENTS DETERMINATION. OF THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM CAPITAL OUTLAY PRIORITIES. AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS WOULD CONTINUE SHOULD THIS BOND MEASURE BE APPROVED. THAT THEREFORE THIS MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS A WAY TO FIND NEW CAMPUS CONSTRUCTION. ABSENT. UC'S AND CSU AND THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIOR CONCURRENCE OF THE NEED FOR ANY NEW CAMPUSES. SO WITH THAT SAID THE MOTION WAS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WITH THE AMENDMENT ADDING A URGENCY BECAUSE. AND MATTER SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD. CALL THE ROLL. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I BLOOM. CHáVEZ. CHAVEZ I IRWIN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. ON THEIR WORK FOR ON THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX CONTINUES TO BUILD UPON THE WORK THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE RELATED CHOI AWARDING. ACADEMIC CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING WHAT THE SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON OUR VETERAN POPULATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AN ASSEMBLY BILL THAT REQUIRE THE CHANCELLOR OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO DETERMINE WHICH COURSES CREDIT WOULD BE AWARDED A FOR PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE CALIFORNIA HAS AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION VETERANS RECITING IN THE STATE AND UPON RETURNING FROM SERVICE MANY DECIDE TO USE OUR MILITARY BENEFITS. TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. WELL ARE VETERAN STUDENTS BRING A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE SURE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTORS. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNSELORS OFFICE RECEIVED A GRANT TO DEVELOP A STRUCTURE FOR INSTITUTING CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING SYSTEM WIDE. MY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE INITIATIVE. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POLICY CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF WORK. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CAN DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO FURTHER IMPROVE CAREER ATTAINMENT FOR OUR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOT A PROBLEM. IF THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR IN THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU.

FOR AGREEING TO THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT HELP. COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO DEVELOP A STRONG PROGRAM OF PRIOR LEARNING ASSESSMENT. THAT WILL NOT ONLY GREAT LEE BENEFIT VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS BUT ALSO OTHER STUDENTS WHO BRING VALUABLE SKILLS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MADAM SECRETARY BUTTE CALL THE ROLL. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER I ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA AYE BLOOM. CHAVEZ. CHAVEZ I IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE LEVINE. LEVINE AYE LOW PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO. WEBER. WEBER I. GEN ZERO YOU BILL IS OUT WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. DOCTOR RUMBULA. ITEM EIGHT. THIS TO. ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN WHICH WOULD APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND EXPAND ENROLLMENT A FULL TIME MEDICAL STUDENTS IN THE PRIME PROGRAM. YOU SEE PRIME IS AN INNOVATIVE TRAINING PROGRAM FOCUSED ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. IN BOTH RURAL COMMUNITIES AND URBAN AREAS. BY COMBINING SPECIALIZED COURSEWORK STRUCTURED CLINICAL EXPERIENCES ADVANCED INDEPENDENT STUDY IN MENTORING. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A LACK OF RUTH A ROBUST PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE. THE REPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO'S HEALTH FORCE CENTER RELEASED LAST SUMMER PROJECTS THAT THE STATE WILL SUFFER A PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS SHORTFALL OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WHAT THE HARDEST HIT AREAS BEING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY? THE CENTRAL COAST AND THE SOUTHERN BORDER AREAS. IF WE CONTINUE ALONG THIS PATH MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE HEADING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA. EAR INFECTIONS OR THE FLU BECAUSE THEY LACK PRIMARY CARE. CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE PREVENTED WITH PROPER CARE AHEAD OF TIME. DURING MY TIME AS ANY OUR DOCTOR ANSELMO I SAW FIRSTHAND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL DOCTORS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND WANT TO OFFER A PERSONAL PLEA. TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE HELPING TO REPAIR WHAT IS A CONDITION THAT SO MANY IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH. LACK OF ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. PLUNDER AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN ENROLLMENT OF MEDICAL STUDENTS WHEN INCREASE BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR. FIFTY PERCENT FOR THE TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO CALENDAR YEAR AND A HUNDRED PERCENT FOR THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR. THIS INCREASE IN THE ENROLLMENT OF MEDICAL STUDENTS IN PRIME WILL ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST SUPPORTING THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. BUT REMOVING BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR WITHIN THE MEDICAL FIELD. ENSURING THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN FUNDING HEALTHCARE EDUCATION THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE PRIME WE CAN GET AHEAD OF THE SHORTFALL IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE WE ARE PROJECTED TO FACE IN THE FUTURE. AND PARTICULARLY THROUGH PRIME WE WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT GREATEST RISK. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ADRIAN MUHAMMAD FROM THE INNER UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. THANK YOU. GET AFTERNOON. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME'S ADRIAN MOM IT WITH THE YOU KNOW AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS ASKED ME LOCAL TO A SIX. WHERE THE SPONSOR THE MEASURE WE REPRESENT? PHYSICIANS IN STATE SERVICE AND COUNTY SERVICE. WE HAVE POSITIONS IN THE US ISSUE AND YOU SEE. STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AS WELL. AND. AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA TESTED THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING LONG TERM. ACCESS TO CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND. ARE COUNTY POSITIONS CURRENTLY THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE TAXED AND A LOT OF THESE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS MANY OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES. THEY THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO MANY PEOPLE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA STATED AND SO. HAVING MORE DOCTORS ALLOWS US TO MITIGATE THAT FACTOR OVER THE COURSE OF. THAT THE LIFE OF EVERYONE AND THEIR GENERATION. SO WE WE JUST WERE POSSIBLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. EXPIRED THEY CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS ALSO IN SUPPORT. I'M CATHERINE NATION I'M THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT I'M. SO GRATEFUL TO SEE DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS INTERESTING FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS. THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE SUTTER PROGRAMS THAT WE LAUNCHED WITHIN YOU SEE NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE HAVE THREE EARNED SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS CURRENTLY ENROLLED LEVEL OF DIVERSITY THAT IS. VERY MUCH NEEDED AND RARELY SEEN ON MEDICAL EDUCATION NEARLY TWO THIRDS OUR STUDENTS WERE UNDERREPRESENTED IN MEDICINE. EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS HAS AN AREA OF FOCUS ON AND TIME ON ALLOWED TO TO GO INTO THIS BUT WE HAVE A RURAL PRIME PROGRAM IN URBAN UNDERSERVED PRIME PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS OR PERSISTENT REST JUST BECAUSE OF A LACK OF CORE OPERATING SUPPORT. AND I THINK THEY WERE LAUNCHED AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT RECESSION AND IT'S. TIME I HOPE TO STABILIZE THIS AND WILL LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA AROUND IN ROMAN TARGETS IN THE VISION OF WHERE WE THINK THIS CAN GO IN AND. IN THE FUTURE. ANY TWO WIENERS. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. LIKE ARAMBULA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL SO WE CAN INVEST IN OUR STATES HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND WORK TOWARDS A HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVED BY MISTER LEVINE. SECOND BY DOCTOR WEBER. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND TO HIS DEDICATION AND ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO PROVIDE. MEDICAL TRAINING TO AREAS THAT THAT NEED MORE DOCTORS SO THE MOTION WAS DO PASS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER.

JURY TEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT COOKIES THAT HELP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. WILL GO TO ITEM TWELVE MISTER HOLDEN. A. B. TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN. WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR WORK ON. WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING. OF ITS IMPORTANCE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN REQUEST UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CONDUCT A BIANNUAL STUDY ON THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY. OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EMPLOYEES OF CALIFORNIA HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE PROGRAMS AND BEST PRACTICES THAT SEEK TO DIVERSIFY THE TECHNOLOGY WORKFORCE. AT THE TOP SEVENTY FIVE COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY ONLY THREE PERCENT. OF EMPLOYEES ARE BLACK ACCORDING TO THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION. PREMIER EMPLOYERS FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE HAVE YET TO ACHIEVE TWO PERCENT AND TECHNICAL JOBS. ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT DIVERSE HIRING SIICON VALLEY INEVITABLY BECOMES A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PIPELINE. YET IT HAS BEEN REPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THAT THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE. AMERICANS OF COLOR AGES FORTY FIVE YEARS AND YOUNGER WITH BACHELOR'S OR ADVANCED DEGREES IN COMPUTER. AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AS WELL AS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING JUST THREE OF SEVERAL FEELS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH. HIGH TECH JOBS REPRESENTING EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT. PERCENT. OF DEGREE HOLDERS YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WITH DEGREES IN THESE BILLS SEVEN PERCENT. OF MEN AND TWELVE PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED UNEMPLOYED. COMPARED WITH TWO PERCENT OF WHITE MEN. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER UTILIZE AND UNDER EMPLOYED. FURTHERMORE THERE IS A SIXTY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE AMONG HISPANIC STUDENTS AND A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE AMONG BLACK STUDENTS FOR STEM DEGREES. AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TOP SILICON VALLEY FIRMS BEGAN DISCLOSING THEIR DIVERSITY DATA. AND TAKING STEPS TOWARDS GROUP. REMEDYING THEIR DIVERSITY PROBLEM AMID PUBLIC PRESSURE. YET WE ARE UNSURE IF THERE ARE ANY TANGIBLE CAO COMES FROM THEIR EFFORTS. ALTHOUGH TECH COMPANIES ARE EAGER TO SHARE THEIR SUPPORT FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION THEY ARE NOT AS EAGER TO SHARE THEIR PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT FROM THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION REPORT FOUND. THAT NATIONWIDE BLACKS HISPANICS AND HISPANICS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY FEWER IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND AND TECHNOLOGY JOBS IN THE HIGH TECH SECTOR. AND THAT THESE GROUPS HAD NEGLIGIBLY NEXT NEGLIGIBLE EMPLOYMENT REPRESENTATION. AND HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AS WITH FAIR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT EFFORTS IS UP TO US TO FORCE THE ISSUE AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY SINCE DIVERSITY IS THE VERY FABRIC. THAT CALIFORNIA'S MADE. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN WILL EXPLORE THE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND HIRING PRACTICES THAT EXIST THROUGH AN ACADEMIC WINS TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF DIVERSITY. IN THE SILICON VALLEY. THIS BILL ALSO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE DIVERSE HIRING IN THE FASTEST GROWING INDUSTRY TO ENSURE ALL COMMUNITIES ARE CONSIDERED. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE RIGHT. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY TWEENER. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IN IS BAKER THANK YOU AND THEN YOU HAVE UNDERSCORED JUST. HAY A ISSUE THAT OUR STATE IN OUR CULTURE REALLY DOES NEED TO ADDRESS. MY OPPOSITION TO THIS IS THAT WE RE DIRECT. SO MUCH TO YOU SEE TO DO AND THEN WE ASK THEM. MAYBE WE'LL FIND IT MAYBE WE WON'T FIND IT. AND. AND I THINK I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE IN FACT THE SOURCE OF SOME INFORMATION YOU HAVE. SHOWS THAT WE CAN GET THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT GIVING ANOTHER. ASK HAVE YOU SEE AT A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF ITS HARSHEST CRITICS IN TERMS OF HOW IT SPENDS ITS DOLLARS BUT. THE FINGER COMMUNITY BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT EVERY TIME WE ASK THEM TO DO A STUDY. AND EVERY TIME WE ASK HIM TO DO REPORTS AFTER REPORTS AFTER PORTS THEY'RE GONNA NEED A LINE ITEM AT SOME POINT TO DO THAT AND. I WOULD I AM JUST LOATH TO DO THAT WHEN THERE ARE DEATHLY OTHER WAYS TO GET. YOU SEE TO APPLY FOR GRANTS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GET. THIS VERY RESEARCH THAT WE NEED AND SO IT'S NOT AT ALL OUT OF. A DISREGARD FOR THE VERY GOOD SPOTLIGHT YOU ARE SHINING ON AN ISSUE THAT IS WORTHY OF ATTENTION IT'S THAT. I THINK THE SOLUTION IS ONE THAT AT WE CAN START GOING FOR WITHOUT. PUTTING ANOTHER ASK OF UC SO I THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THE ISSUE. AND I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING TODAY THAT PERHAPS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO. GO AHEAD AND AND BE APPLYING FOR THESE ARE MANY OF THE OTHER ENTITIES IN THERE SO MANY NONPROFIT RESEARCH ENTITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. THAT CAN BE UNDERTAKING THIS WITHOUT ANOTHER DIRECTIVE FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S THANK YOU. I I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR IS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU SEE. ESPECIALLY. TO MS BAKER'S POINT. UP ON ON FUNDING AT ALL THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU SEE. THERE HAVE BEEN. AND I SEE YOU SEE. COMING IN THE MICROPHONE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON MURPHY UP WE HAVE WE EVER SEE CALIFORNIA I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF RECENTLY. THE DELAY IN GETTING CONNECTED WAS ON MY END NOT IN THE ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND AND SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONNECTING FURTHER WITH THE AUTHOR HAS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TOWARDS APPROPRIATIONS. THE ISSUE OF COST IS IMPORTANT ONE I DON'T ONE UNDERSCORE OR I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE THE IMPACT TOM. WILL CONTINUES CONVERSATIONS OF THE POEM WAS FORWARD THANK YOU. AND AND AND ANOTHER QUESTION. TO THE AUTHOR OF. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE? THAT YOU SEE IS THE THE APPROPRIATE. ABOUT. ENTITY TO BE DOING THE STUDY. I WILL WELL I THINK FOR RELEASED A COUPLE REASONS ONE. LOOKING AT IT THROUGH AN ACADEMIC LANDS. AND TO THAT AS A RESEARCH MINDED INSTITUTION I THINK THEY HAVE THE. INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO GET US TO WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO BE ON THIS IN TERMS OF GATHERING INFORMATION. YOU KNOW. IN A PERFECT WORLD. A VOTE PERFECT WORLD THIS WOULD BE AN ISSUE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU HAVE A SILICON VALLEY COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH US AND I WILL SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE STARTING TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION AROUND THE TOPIC. BICU IT. IN THAT PERFECT WORLD LOOK TO SEE THEM TAKE ON INITIATIVES THAT WOULD WOULD CREATE. A MORE OPEN DOOR POLICY AND A CULTURE THAT WAS LOOKING TO BRING IN. OF THE KIND OF DIVERSITY THAT THE STATE ATTACKS WE PRIDE IN. A BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE BELIEVE THAT THE UC'S PROVIDE THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ACADEMIC STRUCTURE AND WE. THE ABILITY TO DO THE KIND OF RESEARCH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL TO US IN THIS PROCESS. GIVEN ANOTHER. WEEK OR TWO AND WITH THAT KIND OF DIRECTION THAT WE COULD HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OTHER. WAYS OF GOING OUT IT BUT. I THINK BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UC'S I THINK IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE. A RELATIONSHIP THAT WE WANNA. BUILD ON IT EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT POTENTIAL COSTS INVOLVED. AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UC'S IN. TERMS OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THESE BUDGETS ARE SO. SO VAST THAT. ONE COULD PROBABLY LOOK AT A LINE ITEM OR LOOK AT A TOTAL BUDGET AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST COULD BE AND HOW IT COULD BE ABSORBED. BUT THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION THEY WERE WILLING TO HAVE WITH. REPRESENTS OF THE UC'S GOING FORWARD. WELL I I SHARE WITH THE AUTHORED THE THE GOAL. AND. IN MY. A LIMITED TRIPS TO SILICON VALLEY IS AN ISSUE THAT I BROUGHT UP WITH THEM. AND THAT I KNOW THAT THE LATINO CAUCUS HAS DONE AS WELL. OUR AND I. PASSED THE AUTHOR FEE MIGHT. INCLUDE. THE LGBT. A COMMUNITY IN THE STUDY AS WELL THINK JUST AS A SUGGESTION I'M NOT A. WITHOUT A DOUBT. THANK YOU. SO DID WE HAVE THEM WHO. MR LOVE IF ENACTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT RECOGNITION OF THE ALTAR COMMUNITY AND. NOW WANTED PUBLICLY STATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COLLABORATION AS FELLOW CHAIRS OF THE RESPECTIVE CAUCUSES TO BE AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT MOVING FORWARD TO INCLUDE THE UGLY COMMUNITY. I AS I REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF DIVERSITY TO CELEBRATE THE STRENGTH OF THE VERSION THAT. WILL BE REFLECTIVE OF SOCIETY. BUT THE SENSE OF THAT THE THE. IMPLEMENTATION AND AUTHORITY WITH YOU SEE TO HOWEVER BECAUSE A TO TO GET THIS INFORMATION AND THE DATA FROM TECH COMPANIES. HAVE YOU FORESEE THE YOU SEE HAVING THE CAPACITY IN THAT SORT OF THE TEETH TO BE ABLE TO. DO THAT MY APOLOGIES IF A YOUR TO ANSWER THAT EARLIER. WELL I THINK YOUR. WELL SORT OF NOT REALLY I THINK THE POINT IS IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO THE UC'S BECAUSE YOU SEE IS. OUR RESEARCH INTENSIVE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY. THERE JUST TO THE FABRIC OF HOW THE INSTITUTIONS PUT TOGETHER SO WE SEE THAT AS AN ASSET AND. VALUABLE ASSET AND I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ON THIS INITIAL GLIMPSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE. THAT THAT IS THAT DID THE BUT THAT THINK THE CAPACITY THAT THE UC HAS TO TO TO GET THIS INFORMATION. IT ABOUT CAN YOU HELP EXPLAIN PERHAPS WHERE THE UC HAS THE HOW. TO WORK FORTY TWO THEY HAVE TO DEMAND THIS INFORMATION FROM THEM SOMEONE WILL A LOT OF THE RESEARCH IS A LOT OF THE DATA IS AVAILABLE. SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WOULD BE NECESSARILY CREATING THE DATA IT'S BASICALLY COLLECTING THE DATA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN. DIGNIFIED AS I MENTIONED IN MY MY TALKING POINTS THERE'S ALREADY. SOME RECORD RECOGNITION OF WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE VARIOUS. IMPACTED GROUPS AND HOW THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYED WITHIN CERTAIN TECH COMPANIES WITHIN THE AT WITHIN THAT REGION AND SO WHERE. LOOKING AND HOPING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DRAW UPON EXISTING DATA TO HELP IN TERMS OF. FASHIONING SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD GREAT WELL I I AM GOT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL A BILL IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE AND INTENT. ENCAPSULATES A COLLABORATIVE FOCUS WHICH IS THAT OF THIS IS NOT ABOUT A DEMANDING OF THE RATHER WORKING WITH AT THE TECH COMMUNITY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND OUR SOCIETY. THANK YOU. TO TO THAT POINT I I THINK THAT THAT IS A POINT WORTH UNDERSCORING I KNOW THAT. THE VTECH COMMUNITY WAS HERE. MAYBE A MONTH AGO A REPRESENTING OVER THE BEGIN OF THIS MONTH. ARE RECOGNIZING. TECH AWARENESS INTACT A IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT. BUT WE DO THINK THESE ARE SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED FOR AWHILE THAT SOMEONE TO BE SERIOUS AND SOBER ABOUT HOW WE GO AFTER BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSCORE THAT WILL BE IN COLLABORATION. SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THE MISTER HOLDING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE A LET THAT BE MY CLOSING RESPECTFULLY ANSWERING. AND I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVED BY DOCTOR WEBER SECOND BY MISTER BLOOM. THE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. A MADAM SECRETARY OF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER NO ARAMBULA. BLOOM. BLOOM I CHAVEZ CHAVEZ NO IRWIN. KILEY. KILEY NO LEVINE LEVINE I LOW. LOW AYE PATTERSON. QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBER I. THREE BILL IS ON CALL. KEEP IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER OR YEAH. NEXT ITEM FIVE MR MCCARTY. AB TWENTY TO FORTY. EIGHT. THANK YOU. IT'S GOOD TO BE IN THIS COZY ROOM. YES. WELL I'D THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I YOU KNOW I I CAME HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH THAT MUCH MORE PROVOCATIVE BILL ON THIS SAME TOPIC AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR FOR WORKING WITH US TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK ADD MEETS THE GOAL OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND IS THAT A REALISTIC WITH THEIR. CSU STUDENTS AND THE CSU ADMINISTRATION SO ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT SOUTH FINANCE LADEN CALIFORNIA FULL TIME STATUS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE A. PROBLEM WITH NINE THAT CSU STUDENTS GRADUATING WITHIN FOUR YEARS IN FACT ONLY NINETEEN PERCENT. ARE GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS ON SALE STORY. THEN I MET WITH FORCED TO SEE IF YOU STUDENTS LAST MONTH. REAL QUICK AND I ASK THEM. MY LAST OR NOT. MY LETS STORY FROM THE NIGHT TECH I ASKED THE STUDENTS ARE YOU CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS THEY ALSO YES. I ONE BY ONE I SAID DO YOU YOU KNOW I ARE YOU TAKE COMING IT'S YOU TAKEN THIS AT TWELVE THIRTEEN ELEVEN FOURTEEN. AS WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU DON'T GRADUATE FOR YEARS. A TWELVE PERSON MESSES NOT FOUR YEARS YOU RUN OUT OF YOUR CALDERON IF IT'S. NOT OF A NEW. REVENUE AND THEY'RE REAL IMPLICATIONS IT'S ABOUT SIXTY SEVENTY GRAND. AND. COST OF LIVING FINANCIAL LAY BOOKS A SO WORKS TO GO TO COLLEGE IF YOU LOSE YOUR CAL GRANT SO COMING UP WITH A PLAN TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT INFORMATION THE FRONT END THAT WITH ME. IS THAT GRADUATIONS ARE THAT CSU SACRAMENTO WHO INSPIRED US TO DO THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS UNIQUE MISSION. THANK YOU. SWITCHING MY NAME IS JIM DRAGNA I SERVE AS THE ARM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR STUDENTS ARM. EXCESS AND UNIVERSITY INITIATIVES AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND YES I AM DESIGNATED AS THE GRADUATIONS ARE I THINK YOU FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY. I'M NOT TALKING ON BEHALF OF THE CSU ARM SYSTEM AND I WANT TO BE ON CLEAR WITHOUT AS WELL. SACRAMENTO STATE AS MANY. UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION ARE ABOUT THE BUSINESS AT THIS TIME OF OPTIMIZING STUDENT SUCCESS WE MEASURE THAT IN ONE WAY BY LOOKING AT IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES. OF FOREIGN TEN TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES. LIKE OTHER UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO STATE HAS BEEN A PART OF OF DEVELOPING EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO WORK WITH STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND LOOKING AT THE ADVANTAGES OF GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS WE HAVE AS WELL HIRED NEW FACULTY OVER SEVENTY OVER THE LAST TWO YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED NEW SECTIONS TO ALLOW THOSE CLASSES TO BE AVAILABLE TO GO. TO OUR STUDENTS WERE PURSUING THAT ENDEAVOR. AS WELL AS OFFERING ONGOING SUPPORT ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL FOR STUDENTS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO PROGRESS THE WAY THEY INTENDED EXPECT TO. I'M ONE OF THE MESSAGES IT'S OFTEN LOST WITH ALL OF THESE BUT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AT THE UNIVERSITY. IS THAT THERE IS A SIMPLE DIRECTION ABOUT HOW TO FINISH IN FOUR YEARS AND THAT IS TO TAKE THIRTY HOURS EACH YEAR. THE IDEA OF FOUR TIMES THIRTY CALL HUNDRED AND TWENTY IS ALSO OFTENTIMES MISCONSTRUED BY OUR STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE STUDENTS WHO MAY BE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS OR NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE OFFICIAL DIRECTION. OF MANY MEDIEVAL INSTITUTION FORMALITIES. SO WHAT WE DO AT THE UNIVERSITY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THIS LAST TWO YEARS IS DURING OUR SUMMER PROGRAM WE HAVE A FINISH IN FOUR OBJECTIVE. WE ASK OUR STUDENTS TO PLEDGE TO TAKE FIFTEEN HOURS IN THEIR FIRST TWO SEMESTERS WORTH THIRTY HOURS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS WE ASK THEM THE PLEDGE. FINISH OR INTEND TO FINISH IN FOUR. AS A RESULT OF THAT PROGRAM A LAST TWO YEARS. I SHOULD MENTION THAT WE'VE RAISED OUR FIRST YEAR PARTICIPATION AND AND FIFTEEN HOURS. FROM TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT ON THIS LAST ORIENTATION PERIOD. WE FEEL THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT INCREASE IS THAT SIMPLE MESSAGE THAT HELPS TO STUDENTS TO DEFINE THEIR EXPECTATION AND TO PLAN THEIR PARTICULAR JOURNEY. IN ACCORDING TO THE PATH OF FOR YEARS. WHAT WE? ENDORSE WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR BILL HIS SAID THIS ON PROGRAM MARRIES THAT OBJECTIVE WITH THE CAL GRANT WE HAVE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AT SACRAMENTO STATE. WHO ARE CAL STATE AS QUICKLY CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS? AND WE FEEL THAT AT THE POINT OF TIME OR THEY. ACKNOWLEDGE OR. UNDERTAKE TAKING ON THE CAL GRANT THAT THEY WILL BE NOTIFIED AGAIN. THAT THE COW PRINT ITSELF IS A FOUR YEAR OPTIMAL TYPE OF PROGRAM IT IS TIME LIMITED AND IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS WILL BE MARRIED TO THE FACT. THAT FINISHING IN FOR ALSO ALLOWS ITSELF THROUGH BEING A CAL STATE. RUGRATS HIS MERE CAL GRANT RECIPIENT THE OPPORTUNITY ON TV TO DIRECT AND PROGRAM THEIR PETITION OF THEIR PARTICULAR FINANCIAL AID IN A WAY THAT HELPS AND OPTIMIZES THAT ENDEAVOR. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND REPEAT THAT COURSE THAT SOMEHOW LA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. A WHILE THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON TWENTY FORTY EIGHT THE BILL ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS. THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE OBJECTIVES THIS BILL REALLY OFFERS OF REALLY GOOD SOLUTION THAT EMPOWERS STUDENTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEED TO GRADUATE ON TIME IT REQUIRES THE COMMISSION. AND THE A SEGMENTS TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE INFORMED THAT FIFTEEN UNITS THIS SEMESTER THIRTY UNITS PER YEAR IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE. A TYPICAL FOR YOUR DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS STUDENT WILL RECEIVE THIS RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION BEFORE THEY GET TO CAMPUS THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S. FINANCIAL AID AWARD. SECOND ONE STUDENTS ARE ON CAMPUS ALL STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE IT AGAIN DURING ORIENTATION AND THIRDLY A STUDENTS CONTINUING THEIR EDUCATION ALL STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE REMINDED THROUGH THE ENROLLMENT OF CLASSESTHAT TAKING THIRTY UNITS WILL ALLOW THEM TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. WE AS POLICY MAKERS HAVE AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY TO ALIGN OUR EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH OF SUFFICIENT SUPPORT AND RESOURCES WE HAVEN'T YET FOUND THAT PERFECT BALANCE BUT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS IT. THE COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE STATE'S GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS TO COVER MORE OF THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS ONE WAY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. ESTABLISHES AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WHICH WILL MEASURE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THE BILL REQUIRES THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE D. M. V.. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO TRACK WAGE DATA SO THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. CAN BE IMPROVED TO YIELD OPTIMAL RESULTS FOR ITS STUDENTS. SOME OF THE ISSUES OF PRIVACY IS HAVE BEEN MENTION ANDI CAN ASSURE YOU THAT ALL AGENCIES WILL PROTECT THE DATA. CLARIFY. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD BE GETTING BACK IS WAGED DATA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE HERE WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. OUR LARA MATTOON WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND ALEJANDRO IS B. KNOWS THAT WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MORE MATURE IN WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHERE THE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. IN SEPTEMBER A BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS THE VISION CONTAINS SIX GOALS FROM PRUDENT IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND A SERIES OF COMMITMENTS ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE MAKE TO OUR SYSTEM IS THAT WE WILL FOSTER THE USE OF DATA TO DRIVE DECISION MAKING ACROSS THE COLLEGES. TO THIS AND OUR OFFICE PUBLISHES AN ANNUAL SCORECARD TO ABOUT WHO YOU A COLLEGE PROGRESS AND WE PUBLISH AN ANNUAL LAUNCH BOARD THAT PROVIDES DATA THAT COLLEGES CAN USE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE GIVING IN IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES. SPECIFICALLY WE CAN LOOK AT SALARY GAINES AND PLACEMENT RATES AND WE CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY OF OUR GRADUATES ATTAIN A REGIONAL LIVING WAGE WE ALSO PUBLISH AN ONLINE TOOL CALLED SALARY SURFER. THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO VIEW THIS AGGREGATE INFORMATION AND THEY CAN HELP STUDENTS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS THEY MIGHT LIKE TO STUDY. IN. THIS IS ALL A. ABLE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF AN AGREEMENT WE HAVE UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THAT ALLOWS US TO ENTER INTO A DATA SHARING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. TO MATCH OUR GRADUATES WITH WAGE FILES THAT THEY CAN. HAVE ON FILE AYE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS PUP AND PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN SENATOR HUFF AUTHORED A BILL THAT ACT REQUIRED CSU AND YOU SEE TO PUBLISH SIMILAR DATA. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL IT WOULD ENCOURAGE A SIMILAR DATA SHARING AGREEMENT THAT WOULD INVOLVE STUDENTS THAT TOUCH THE UC CUT BY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ON HOW THERE'S BEEN ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOWARD ACCENT CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. OF THIS BILL STEMMED FROM ORACLE ADMINISTRATION OF THE THE OF THE ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT ALONG WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT? ON OUR SIDE ADULT STUDENTS OR. ADULT COURSES ADVOCATE TWELVE LEVEL DON'T COLLECT SOCIAL SECURITY. SO THAT WAS ONE BARRIER AND KIND OF COLLECTING AND SEEING. SOME OF THE WAGE DATA TO SEE HOW STUDENTS ARE FARING AFTER COMPLETING COURSEWORK. IN THE EVENT OF DEVELOPING THE PROPOSAL. WE ALSO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN EXPAND THIS TO LOOK AT K. TWELVE RECENT GRADUATES TO TO BE A TO BE ABLE TO BETTER INFORMED AND AT DATA TO OUR COLLEGE AND CAREER INDICATOR FOR THE DASHBOARD. SO WE'RE HOPING. WITH THIS DATA WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE NUMBER PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO ENTERED THE WORKFORCE DIRECTLY. OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHAT SECTOR THEY THEY WENT INTO. THEIR THEIR WAGE LOOKING AT. STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE WORKFORCE. MAKING HIGHER WAGES IF THE COMPLETED A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAY OR SOME SORT OF CERTIFICATION OR THEY ARE THEY GOING DIRECTLY INTO. ANOTHER SECTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CHANCES OFFICE MENTIONED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD NOT RECEIVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. WE WOULD BE SENDING OUR NAME OUR FIRST NAME LAST NAME. BIRTHDATE. GENDER AND THE STUDENT. I DE. TO THE DMV WHO THEN WOULD IDENTIFY. THOUGH SOCIAL SECURE SECURITY NUMBERS THOSE NUMBERS WOULD BE VAN TRANSFER TO THE E. D. D. DIRECTLY. I WHAT WE WOULD GET BACK IS BASICALLY. THE STUDENT IDENTIFIER WITH THE WAGE STATE ON WE WOULD NOT RECEIVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AT ALL. THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WOULD I'M LOOK BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WOULD BE BOTH THE DMV AND EBD WHO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. AND AGAIN. WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS DATA. WOULD HELP INFORM SCHOOL DISTRICTS UP TO SEE WATER THEIR LOCAL NEEDS WITH REGARDS TO. EMPLOYMENT AND SO FORTH TO BETTER ALIGN THEIR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND WITH THAT OF HOLLOW OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TWEENER SOME OTHER COMMENTS. ANYWAY THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. TRIP BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE MY EM. THOUGHTS AND QUESTIONS HAD THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN TRANSPORTATION WHEN THIS WAS BEFORE TRANSPORTATION I APPRECIATE. THAT YEAH THE FIRST APPRECIATE THE GOAL JUST MAKING SURE FOR GONNA HAVEPROGRAMS RUN HAVE EXPENDITURES TRYING TO DO PROGRAMS. TOO OFTEN WE MIGHT SEE RESULTS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH PROGRAM TO TIED TO THE RESULTS SO THAT WE CAN INVEST IN THOSE MORE AND WHICH ONES ARE FAILING WE OR UNDER PERFORMING THAT WE CAN. NOT PRIORITIZE. HOWEVER THE WHILE YOU MAY NOT BE GETTING SO SECURITY NUMBERS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE RELIANCE ON THEM PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH EDT. IS WHERE I FEEL THIS IS FLAWED AND WHY I DIDN'T SUPPORT IN TRANSPORTATION AND AGAIN DO NOT TODAY. EDT HAS. USES FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WHEN THEY MAIL. UP BENEFIT INFORMATION OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THEY SAY THAT THE REASON WHY THEY'RE SO RELIANT ON THE FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS IT THEY NEED ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX YEARS. TO CHANGE THEIR SOFTWARE AND IT'S GONNA TAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE MORE WE PERPETUATE THAT INSTEAD OF STARVING OUR STATE OF HAVING TO RELY ON FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS THE MORE WE ARE. CONTINUING TO CREATE A COSTLY PROBLEM. AND SEE WHERE I WOULD BE CONCERNED IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY A VALID REPORTING THAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE. BUT. RIGHT NOW EDTA IS TRYING TO CHANGE OVER A SIX YEAR PROCESS ITS COMPUTERS IF THEY COME TO US AGAIN AND SAY WELL WE IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GETTING ALL THIS INFORMATION IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS REPORT. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FOR THAT AND SO WE CAN'T CHANGE THIS PART OF OUR CODE OR IT JUST MAKES IT TAKE LONGER. COST MORE AND CONTINUE TO EXPOSE OUR CONSTITUENTS TO PRIVACY CONCERNS. AND MY HOPE WAS THAT THE LAST FOUR DIGITS WE'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED. YOU CAN EVEN WONDER IF ANY SO SECURITY INFORMATION AS I RECALL WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE. THIS IS WHERE THAT THE DATA IS ARE ARE AND SO WE WE NEED TO HAVE SOME. SO SECURITY NUMBER TIED BUT USING THE FULL NUMBER AND AND. ENABLING. I ET DE TO CONTINUE ITS PROBLEMS IS I THINK OF THE FLAW HERE. AND. I STILL VERY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MAKING THAT CHANGE. AND A EITHER LOOKING FOR OTHER IDENTIFIERS. OR OR IT'S A MUCH BETTER USE OF TIME AND MONEY TO TRY TO DEVELOP THOSE IDENTIFIERS INSTEAD OF BASICALLY LOCKING US EVEN FURTHER INTO E. D. D.'S ANTIQUATED. AND. VERY COSTLY AND UNHELPFUL SYSTEM SO WITH THAT LOVE LOVE THE GOAL CONTINUE TO VERY MUCH RESPECT THE CHAIR FOR HAVING THE RIGHT PRIORITIES FOR HOW WE CAN HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT AM. VERY MUCH WHICH WE HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT AND AND I HOPE WE DON'T MISS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. WITH THAT AT THIS WAS MOVED BY MISTER LOW WE NEED A SECOND. SECOND I MISTER ARAMBULA.
