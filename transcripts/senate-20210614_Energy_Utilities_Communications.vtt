OUR CONSUMERS ARE EXPECTING TO

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:13.933
DO THIS ONLINE AND IT'S

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.501
ACTUALLY CHEAPER FOR. ONLINE

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.037
THAN TO. WALK INTO A FACILITY

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:18.971
OR TO WRITE A CHECK AND HAVE

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.806

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.855
AT THE DATA BECAUSE- OF CODE

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.389

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:14.246
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT BUSINESS

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:16.949
DOES. HE IN ANY. OUT THERE IS.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.784
PROCESSING CREDIT CARDS IN YOU

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.119
KNOW IT IS IT A BURDEN

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.887
SOMETIMES ON AN INDIVIDUAL

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:24.857
BASIS- TO BE CHARGING YOUR

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:27.393
PEOPLE BACK. YOUR DOOR DIRECTLY

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:28.594
AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.061
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.196
UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES TAKE

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.798
STATE LEGISLATION TO GET THAT

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:34.600
DONE. EVEN ON THE COUNTY LEVEL

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.402
SOME MIGHT TRY TO GET DONE IN.

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.771
IN NAPA COUNTY- FOR MANY YEARS

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.239
AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S MORE OF

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.373
THIS WILL HELP BECAUSE IT JUST

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.776
MAKES IT EASIER. FOR CONSUMERS

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:44.643
TO PAY IT'S MORE CONVENIENT FOR

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.645
THE CONSUMER MORE CONVENIENT

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:48.781
FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.350
