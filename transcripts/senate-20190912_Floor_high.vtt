RESOURCES LIKE THE TREVOR

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:32.480

LGBT YOUTH CURRENTLY DOES HAVE

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:37.018

THIS ISSUE AND I WELCOME THEM.

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:50.965

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:52.066
IN THE JUDGMENT OF THIS

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:56.337
LEGISLATION TWELVE. OR UNDER IS

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:58.940
SIMPLY TOO YOUNG TO JUST GO

WITHOUT ANY PARENTAL OVERSIGHT.

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:05.680
THERE ARE MANY DANGERS ON THE

INTERNET WELL IS INCREDIBLY

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:11.653
USEFUL TOOL WE THINK THAT THOSE

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:14.155
MINERS OUGHT TO HAVE AT LEAST

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.757

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:33.941
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BECAUSE

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.610
I THINK THIS LEGISLATION WILL

01:28:35.677 --> 01:28:38.513
CAUSE SEVERE HARM TO LGBT USE I

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.714
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:41.482
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR OF

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.184
THIS LEGISLATION IS TRYING TO

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.653
DO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THERE

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.488
ARE NO BAD MOTIVES HERE THE

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.590
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO PROTECT

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:50.825
CHILDREN BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:53.494
RISKS FOR CHILDREN TO GO ONLINE

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.463
AT A YOUNG AGE SO THIS IS NOT

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.498
ABOUT CASTING ASPERSIONS ON

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:59.600
MOTIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE WHAT

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.035

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:25.126
HARMING THEM AND ISOLATING THEM

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.594

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.397
WORTHLESS. THESE KIDS WITHOUT

ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. OR

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.036
QUICKLY CUT OFF FROM ANY HOPE

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.872

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:38.906
HOPE FOR THEM AND THAT THERE

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.708

KIDS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN

ABUSIVE HOMES. THIS BILL WILL

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.561
RESULT IN MORE SOLATION OF

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:03.397
THESE KIDS AND MORE HARM TO

WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PARENTS

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.783
WHO STILL SEND THEIR KIDS TO

CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH AS WE

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.219
KNOW IS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:28.523
IN FACT THIS LEGISLATURE BANDS

DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:20.701

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:25.306
ONLY WAY THAT THEY HAVE

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:28.309
CONNECTING WITH THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:28.943
IS THROUGH THE INTERNET THAT IS

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:33.347

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:52.066
FOR THEM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:54.168
OUT THERE WHO SUPPORT THEM AND

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.570
LOVE THEM AND FOSTER THEM. I

01:32:56.637 --> 01:32:58.673
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RISKS

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.841
FOR CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.410

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:04.045
IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:06.013

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.983
THAT THESE KIDS WILL BE HARMED

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.053

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:29.877
ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFY

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.612

THINK HOWEVER I'M GOING TO HAVE

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.356

THE AGE RESTRICTION I GOES HERE

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:55.736
THAT THERE IS A MATURITY LEVEL

THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE. AND

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:00.441
THAT WE AS ADULTS HAVE A

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:03.844
RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT BRACES IN

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:06.714
PLACE TO PROTECT THEM SOMETIMES

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.716

CAN HANDLE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.189
THE WORLD. I THINK THAT WE

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:17.458
AGAIN SHOULD REALLY BE CLEAR

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.627
ABOUT WHAT ROLE WE HAVE PLAYED

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.161

CONCERNS AND I CERTAINLY

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.522
STIPULATE THERE ARE BAD PARENTS.

BUT FOR MANY YEARS. GOVERNMENT

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:34.294
AS INTERFERED WITH THE PARENT

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:36.163
CHILD RELATIONSHIP. MADE IT

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:41.368
HARDER. FOR PARENTS TO BE

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:41.969
ENGAGED IN THE LIVES OF THEIR

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:46.840
CHILDREN. THEN CAME THE

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.709

01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:56.750
REALLY BAD. PARTICULARLY THE

SEXUAL PREDATORS I PERFECTED

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:04.858

DOING THIS WE ARE TAKING AN

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:18.806
ATTEMPT. DESTRUCTIVE THE

AND THOUGH THERE ARE

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:37.090
DIFFICULTIES WITH. PERRANCE. I

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:39.092

MOTHER AND FATHER. IS A

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:46.600
SUPERIOR BOND TO ALL AND WE

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:47.167
MUST PROTECT THAT BOND THIS

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:50.704

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.006

WITH THE GREAT CENTERED ON LOS

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.652
ANGELES THAT DONNA WE DO KNOW

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:07.754
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS POWERFUL

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:09.156
BUT THERE IT'S ALSO VERY VERY

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:11.625
DANGEROUS AND I DO WANT TO

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.060
ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS OF MY

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:15.395
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IT

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:16.563
IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:19.466
VALID POINTS HOWEVER. IT IS A

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.568
REAL THREAT TO OUR CHILDREN AND

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.303
I CAN JUST TELL YOU VERY

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.138
BRIEFLY SOME A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.841
HOW IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS IN

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:28.709
THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD THAT I

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:32.346
COME FROM WE HAD A COMMUNITY OF

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:35.482
ABOUT TEN KIDS SCHERING NAKED

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.084
PHOTOS ALMOST NAKED PHOTOS OF

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:39.786
THEMSELVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND

01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:40.387
IT TOOK US A LITTLE WHILE TO

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.723
CATCH ON TO IT. MY POINT BEING

01:42:42.789 --> 01:42:44.024
IS I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE MATURE

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:45.092
ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:42:45.158 --> 01:42:46.460
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT TEN IT'S

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:47.528
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:49.296
THERE FOREVER I THINK AS

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:50.664
ELECTED OFFICIALS WE UNDERSTAND

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.132
ONE PICTURE OUT THERE YOU'LL

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:54.568
NEVER GET IT BACK AND STILL WIN

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:56.036
FAIR EXPOSING THEMSELVES AT

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.572
NINE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THAT

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.240
MAY AFFECT THEM THIRTY YEARS

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:01.808
FROM NOW AS THEY'RE SEEKING A

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:05.212
JOB THEY'RE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:07.447
AND NOW AS WE KNOW NOW MENTORS

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.348
ARE ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:10.284
UNDERSTAND. THE PERSON THAT

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.219
THEY'RE HIRING AND MANY HAVE

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:14.121
BEEN DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:16.123
OF SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS ON

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:19.860
SOCIAL MEDIA AND I THINK THAT

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:21.595
EVEN WHEN WE GO TO THIS THEATER

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.263

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:28.735
KIND OF CONTENT AND SETTLE AS

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:15.816

WEBSITES THAT ARE THAT ARE GOOD

FOR THEM BUT I KNOW THAT ALL

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:22.789
PARENTS ARE NOT THE SAME. I'M

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.491
ALSO VERY OPEN AND WELCOMING AS

OF PARENTS ARE LIKE ME. AND TO

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:32.833
YOUR POINT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

SAN FRANCISCO COMPLETELY

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.436

FULL YOU KNOW TO HEART. I ALSO

01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:39.706
KNOW THAT TERE'S YOUNG WOMEN

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:42.042
OUT THERE THAT COULD ALSO HAVE

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.276
THE POTENTIAL BE LIMITED A

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:44.578
BECAUSE HE MAY BE SEXUALLY

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.113
ASSAULTED AT HOME AND THERE

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:47.881
COULD BE A MULTITUDE OF VARIOUS

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.283
ISSUES. SOME VERY. I UNDERSTAND

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.685
COMPLETELY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:52.719
WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.254
BILL WOULD DO IF IT IS

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.423
IMPLEMENTED AND I AM GOING TO

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.324
BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. IS THAT

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:59.626
IT WORKS WITH OUR- LGBT Q.

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:01.161
CENTERS ARE SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:05.098
CENTERS TO EDUCATE YOUNG ADULTS

01:45:05.165 --> 01:45:07.134
SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND FULLY

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:07.734
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO ON

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.636
THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:12.172
ALSO HAVING WORKED AT MICROSOFT

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:13.640
FOR MANY YEARS I ACTUALLY

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:15.242
ENGAGED IN A LOT OF. WORK NOT

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.576
JUST WITH PARENTS BUT WITH

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:18.445
YOUNG STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:20.180
THAT THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:21.848
THEY WERE GETTING GETTING INTO

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:22.983
IF THEY DID CREATE AN ACCOUNT.

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:26.620
AND WE JUST DON'T WANT TO GO

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.488
DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF ALLOWING

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:32.225
THESE. THESE YOUNG STUDENTS

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.627
THESE YOUNG ADULTS TO BE ABLE

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:34.961
TO ACCESS A SOCIAL MEDIA

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:36.463
ACCOUNT THAT THEY MAY NOT KNOW

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.598
HOW TO ACT TO OPERATE. AND SO

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:39.900
FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE IN

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.468
SUPPORT. BUT I COMPLETELY

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:42.803
UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING I

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:43.704
REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE WORK

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.672
WITH THE CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.374
YOU KNOW STUDENTS AND KIDS ARE

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:50.243
USING THEM APPROPRIATELY. AND

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.844
THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW GORE FOR

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:52.012
GO FORWARD FROM THERE SO THANK

01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:56.683
YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ

01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:02.756
SENATOR DRAWS SO. I THINK WAT

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:03.890
IS MOST TROUBLING TO ME IS

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.192
THAT. WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:07.227
WHETHER TO PROTECT. THIS GROUP.

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:07.794
OR THAT GROUP MEAN IT FEELS

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:10.597
LIKE. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:12.132
WITH THAT THE CONVERSATION. WE

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:13.300
ALL CARE ABOUT ALL THESE KIDS

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:16.336
ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE.

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:18.271
AND I FEEL AS IF WE'RE NOT EVEN

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:20.974
CATCHING UP. THOSE WHO ARE

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:23.577
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING THIS

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:26.580
IN THE FIRST PLACE ALLOWING IT

01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:29.850
TO BE ON OUR DIFFERENT SOCIAL

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:32.119
MEDIA OR INTERNET WHICH I

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:33.320
DON'T. TECHNICALLY UNDERSTAND.

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:37.657
BUT WE GOT TO GET TO THE ROOT

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:41.595
OF THE ISSUE MORE THAN WHICH IS

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.830
MORE VALUABLE WHICH OF OUR KIDS

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.433
WHICH ARE WE GOING TO PROTECT

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.201
MORE THAN OTHERS THAT JUST

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:51.238
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AS A LAW AND

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.707
THE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.175
THAT BUT I THINK THAT THOSE WHO

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:57.744
ARE THE TECHIES WHO DO

01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:01.014
UNDERSTAND THIS WE HAVE TO GET

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:02.682
TO THE BOTTOM OF NOT ALLOWING

01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:06.019
THIS TO BE. ANY KIND OF DANGER

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:07.687
FOR ANY OF OUR KIDS FOR ALL OF

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:10.891
OUR KIDS AND I CERTAINLY HOPE

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:12.292
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:14.928
WERE TAKING THESE MEASURES MUCH

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.329
LIKE I FELT WHEN THE

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.732
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:21.802
NOT HOMELESS STUDENTS SHOULD

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:23.670
PARK WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:25.705
CARS SHOULD PARK IN THE PARKING

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.741
LOTS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:30.243
THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER TO THE

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:34.514
PROBLEM SO. I'M ALSO VERY TORN

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:37.250
BUT I'M EVEN MORE TORN BECAUSE

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:40.053
AN ANGRY THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.589
WITH IT ON THIS LEVEL RATHER

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:46.092
THAN ON THE TRUTH GET TO THE

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:53.033
CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM LEVEL.

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:53.900

FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE WE HAD

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:41.408
A BOOK WITH FACES IN IT THAT WE

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:42.342
CIRCLED THE FACES AND LOOKED AT

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:44.144
WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CLASS

YEAR. SO MANY MARK ZUCKERBERG

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:50.383
CAME TO SCHOOL AND DECIDE TO

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.984
PUT ALL THAT ON THE INTERNET.

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:53.620
AND HERE WE ARE. A FEW YEARS

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:54.220
LATER AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IS

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:59.492
CHANGED. THE ENTIRE NATURE OF A

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:01.328
OF WHAT A OF FRIENDSHIP NETWORK

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:04.097
LOOKS LIKE IT'S CHANGED HOW WE

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:04.664
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IS

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:07.334
CHANGED. HOW WE SIT AT THE

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.302
DINNER TABLE IS CHANGED HOW

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:10.737
YOUNG PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:13.540
IN IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:14.040
HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL IS

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:17.544
CHANGING. AND THEY MAY SAY

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:21.081
THAT. IT'S JUST A PLATFORM. BUT

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:21.715
IT'S JUST TO A NEUTRAL PIPELINE

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:25.585
OF INFORMATION. BUT I THINK TO

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:27.354
THE CENTER FROM SANTA BARBARA.

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.456
AND SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES IS

01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:33.293
POINT. IT'S TIME THAT THE TECH

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.829
INDUSTRY TOOK AN EQUITY STAKE.

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:38.965
IN THE EXTERNAL COSTS OF THE

01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:41.701
PRODUCTS THAT WE UTILIZE THERE

01:50:41.768 --> 01:50:44.404
IS GREAT VALUE TO THESE

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:44.938
PRODUCTS YES BUT THERE ARE

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:48.508
GREAT COST AS WELL. SO I THINK

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:49.109
IF YOU'RE SUPPORTING HIS BILL

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:51.111
TODAY WHICH I CERTAINLY WILL BE.

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:52.078
YOU'VE ALSO BOUND YOURSELF IN

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:56.216
MY VIEW TO A COMMITMENT. TO TRY

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:59.185
TO FIND SOME WAY. TO OFFSET

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.253
THESE EXTERNAL COSTS ON OUR

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.289
YOUTH AND I THINK THAT. THE

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:03.823
TECH INDUSTRY OUGHT TO BE

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:08.661
TAKING A. EQUITY STAKE IN MORE

01:51:08.728 --> 01:51:11.431
LGBT CENTERS AND MORE ARE MORE

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.233
RESOURCES FOR AT RISK YOUTH OF

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:16.202
ALL GENDERS SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:18.638
RACES. BECAUSE IT'S HAVING AN

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:21.975
IMPACT ACROSS THE BOARD. AND

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:22.509
THAT GOES AS WELL FOR THE

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:25.145
IMPACT ON JOURNALISM. AND OTHER

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:27.213
EXTERNAL COSTS THIS IS NOT A

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.049
NEUTRAL INDUSTRY THEY CAN BE

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:30.517
LEADERS BUT IT'S TIME THAT WE

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:32.085
PUT A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.386
TOGETHER NOT JUST PROTECT

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:35.155
PRIVACY. BUT TO ADDRESS THESE

01:51:35.221 --> 01:51:38.291
UNDERLYING EXTERNAL COSTS. THE

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:41.561
LAST THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS.

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:43.897
YOU KNOW I RESPECTED THE FAMILY

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.832
BOND IS CRITICAL AND THAT

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:48.034
PARENTS I'M I'M BLESSED TO HAVE

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:51.071
GROWN UP IN A HOME WHERE. I WAS

01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:54.674
LOOK LOVE PROBABLY TOO MUCH BUT

01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:57.210
BUT LOOKED AFTER AND I DIDN'T

01:51:57.277 --> 01:52:01.414
HAVE TO FIND IN THIS STATE.

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:02.148
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE FOR AND

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:06.119
REAL NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT.

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:07.754
BUT I YOU KNOW I WATCHED IN MY

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:10.690
FAMILY MY TEENAGE SISTERS GO

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:13.993
THROUGH SOME VERY HARD TIMES

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.429
AND THE OUTLET THAT THEY FOUND.

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:18.131
ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS VERY

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:22.402
IMPORTANT TO THEM. BUT I

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:25.405
REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY REAL

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.874
RISKS THAT EMERGED AND I DON'T

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:28.408
WANT TO GET INTO TOO MUCH

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:31.010
DETAIL BUT- YOU HAVE TO MAKE A

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:34.280
JUDGMENT CALL WHETHER. AT THE

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.749
AGE OF TWELVE OR UNDER

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:40.720
UTILIZING A RESOURCE. IS MORE

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:44.457
PERILOUS THAN IT IS PRODUCTIVE.

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:45.425
I THINK THAT PARENTS CAN'T BE

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:47.393
RELIED ON SOLELY THAT WE NEED

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.762
