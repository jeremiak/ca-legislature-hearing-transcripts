TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX WERE UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO WERE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. PAST APPROACHES TO HOMELESSNESS HAVE RELIED ON ONE TIME SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER AS WE SEE. HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS ON THE RICE OF HOMELESSNESS APPROACH NEEDS A LONGER TERM SOLUTION. AS PART OF OUR WORK IN THE COMMITTEE WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THESE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENTS TO SHAPE FUTURE FUNDING. TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. OUR FIRST ISSUE OF THE DAY.

CD CHRIS HILL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

PROPOSITION ONE INCLUDING WHAT THE STATE STANDS WITH. FUNDS AWARDED OBLIGATED AND EXPENDED EXPANDED. AS WELL AS TOUCH ON STAFFING AT HDD AND THEN LAUNCH INTO MORE DETAILS ON ISSUE ONE. I BELIEVE IT'S BACKGROUND THE STATE'S. I BELIEVE US BACK INTO THE STATE'S FUNDING APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE HOUSING BOND IN TERMS OF LONG TERM FUNDING ANTICIPATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT COULD HELP. WITH HOMELESSNESS. LET'S BEGIN WITH PANEL NUMBER ONE. MR ALMOST. THANK YOU HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME I UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES GET STARTED. WE GET TO GO. YOUR GREAT THANK YOU. ALSO WILL HAVE TO COMBINE- COUPLE THINGS WITH THE OVERALL PROPOSED ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTOPHER FINANCE WILL DO THAT BUT TO YOUR REQUESTED MAN SHARE BEFORE DRESSING HOME KEY I DO WANT TO TAKE THAT PROVIDE A FEW UPDATES ON A. T. OPERATIONS AS YOU ASK FOR RELATING TO THE HOUSING FUND BALANCES. AS WELL AS OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS- ONCE ACCOUNTING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THERE'S ABOUT THE WORDS ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AVAILABLE TOWARDS ECD PROGRAM THROUGH THE PROPOSITION ONE. PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY FOR DEVELOPMENT THOSE FUNDS ARE SPREAD OUT AMONG SEVERAL PROGRAMS OVER SEVERAL YEARS- AND TO DATE ONE POINT ONE EIGHT BILLION OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN AWARDED. AND THE REMAINDER IS ARE CURRENTLY EITHER AVAILABLE OR NOTICES OF MONEY AVAILABILITY OR WILL BE LATER. IN TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR THE NEW PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM WAS- AUTHORIZED PROPST TWO AND THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ONE POINT ONE THREE BILLION OF THE POSSIBLE ONE POINT EIGHT SIX BILLION HAS BEEN AWARDED AND ANOTHER FUNDING ROUND OF FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THAT PROGRAM LATER THIS YEAR. AND I CAN ELABORATE ANY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WHEN IT COMES THAT TIME JEFF QUESTIONS WE DO HAVE I WOULD NOTE TABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH OUTLINED- THE FUNDS AVAILABLE. TO FUND AWARDED THE FUND EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF THOSE PROGRAM FROM PROPS ONE INTO OUR CHART WE HOPE OR HELPFUL TOOL. AND HAPPY TO DIRECT YOU GUYS THEIR THIGHS HELPFUL. FORTY QUESTIONS OF THREE PROGRAMS. ON DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT ADDED A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POSITIONS TIED TO THE C. ONE HOUSING PACKAGE IN OTHER ENACTED LAWS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE- IT DEPARTMENT ALSO GROWN CONSIDERABLY BEYOND THOSE POSITIONS IN OTHER AREAS ESPECIALLY TIED. TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RESOURCES RIVER CITY IN FEDERAL RESOURCES FROM PAST DISASTERS AS WELL AS KOBE. THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN OUR DEPARTMENT HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POSITION TO GROWTH TIED TO YOU SPECIFICALLY HOUSING PACKAGE AND- AND STUFF BUT AND THEN I DON'T PASSED THE LEGISLATURE. OVERALL OUR CURRENT VACANCY RATE THE DEPARTMENT 11% WHICH IS IN LINE WITH AN AVERAGE BEACON STREET FOR DEPARTMENT OR SIZE BUT TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THE VACANCY RATE WAS EIGHTEEN PERCENT. IN JULY OF LAST YEAR FOLLOWING THE LAST INFUSION OF NEW POSITIONS SO THE NUMBER CONTINUES TO REDUCE EVERY MONTH. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT- WE'RE ACTUALLY ON PACE OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS WE'RE ADDING OVER ONE HIGHER EACH DAY TO KEEP UP WITH OUR GROWTH AND WITH DISTRICT COURT TURNOVER. CHAU BEFORE WE GET OUT OF THE OTHER ITEMS- I KNOW THAT- YOU'D LIKE HEAR ABOUT ON THE ACTUAL BUDGET PROPOSALS.

THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE BEFORE WE BEGIN QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CARRY MEMBERS I LOOK THAT'S WHAT I WAS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED- THE HOME KEY PROPOSAL IS ONE THREE MAJOR PROPOSALS RELATED CHIU HOMELESSNESS I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE- HERE THOUGH AND THAT IS THE ONE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS JURISDICTION OVER. AND SO I'LL JUST NOTE HERE THAT THE PROPOSAL BUILDS OFF- THE ROOM KEEP PROGRAM WHICH FOCUSED ON THE SCENE AND PROPERTIES THE PROPOSAL BUILT ON THAT BY FOCUSING ON THE ACQUISITION CAPITALIZATION OF PROPERTIES. AS A RESULT- WE DO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO FEDERATION ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTION ON OUR MIND HOW THOSE PROPERTIES WOULD BE MAINTAINED. THERE IS A BIG PROVIDED OVER THE LONG TERM WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR MAINTENANCE PLAN OVER THE SHORT TERM YEAH BY STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL SOURCES OF COUPLE TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF A WITH. THE CHILDREN. MORE ABOUT THE LONG TERM YOU KNOW FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OUT ON WATERSHED Z. HAPPENED RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ME TINO'S PROPERTY ADDRESS- OF THE HOME WITH A SEAT ON A LONG TERM. BASIS HI OTHER QUESTIONS CONSIDERATION RELATED TO HE- I. REQUEST OFF ON THE HUNDRED DOLLARS OFTEN. OF PREVIOUS FOR THE- AS WE AROUND WHAT LESS LEARNED RELIGIOUS IN OUR FOR INCREASED. THAT COULD BE MORE AND OF COURSE IN THE FORWARD. AS WELL AS THEY IS A COME THAT WOULD BE- REQUESTED IN. THE BUDGET YOU. ON IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR TO THE END OF THE YEAR HAVE FROM MINISTRY. WHAT IS THERE TO THE TINY AND WHAT THE BENEFITS OF ACTING EARLY ON THAT PIECE. OF HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. THANK YOU. I THINK. THANK YOU MISS I MAY YOU AND IF ENOUGH TO TURN OFF THE VIDEO YOU CAN OF CUT OFF AT THE END OF YOUR CALL AT THE END. IT'S FINE FOR NOW IF IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN JUST- JUST NUMBER THAT'S COMING FROM. SO LET'S THE I WANT TO GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BUT I'M I'M GONNA TAKE THE LIBERTY OF IT OF ASKING A- FEW- I'M- MR- OWN STATE I. ASSUME THAT THE YOU MAY BE THE BEST ANSWER THIS BUT- MAYBE NOT HOW MANY UNITS HAVE BEEN CREATED WITH THE PROP ONE IMPROMPTU BONDS. I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT MY FINGERTIPS- THE- I HAPPILY HAPPY YOU GET THE THAT INFORMATION THE COMMITTEE- AFTER THIS ELECT. HASSANAL NEEDED NEEDED I MEAN I MEAN THE NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT IS WE DO NOT. AWARD ARE SORRY SHOULD IT SAY DISBURSE THOSE FUNDS UNTIL UNITS ARE BUILT SO WHEN WE AWARD FUNDS- IT FOR PERSPECTIVE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT AND SO- MANY OF THOSE ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES. OF MEDIA FUNDS HAVE BEEN EXPENDED AT THIS POINT BUT THE NATURE OF THE BILL THE PROCESS CAN HAVE A DECENT TIME HORIZON AND SOME OF OUR FUNDS ARE SOME OF THE FIRST MONTH AND THEN THEY'RE TYPICALLY SEEKING TAX CREDITS IN BONDS THROUGH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. OFTEN. HAVE LOCAL SOURCES OF FINANCING. THINGS LIKE OF THAT NATURE IN SO- WE HAVEN'T SEE A TO. OF ACTUAL. COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION FROM PROP ONE GIVEN WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF THE FIRST NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR THE FOR THE ON GOING OUT IN TWO THOUSAND. BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME IN A CERTAIN PROGRAM AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME. I'M INTERESTED TO DEVELOP. SOME OF ON SAID I DO HAVE SAY THAT I KNOW THAT BUDGET STAFF DID COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ON CERTAIN DETAILS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FOR THIS HEARING A SPECIFICALLY. THE UNITS CREATED IN PROP ONE IMPROMPTU BOND SINCE I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE SINCE YOU WERE ASKED BUT IN YOUR ESTIMATION AS YOU CAN YOU ESTIMATE. HOW MANY UNITS HAVE OR WILL BE CREATED. WITH PROP ONE INTO BONDS. YEAH WHAT JUST MAKE IT UP WITH A ON THE- AMOUNT AWARDED EXPANDED I'M SORRY THAT THAT INFORMATION ABOUT UNITS COULD YOU COULD NOT GET TO ME HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT AT A LATER DATE- SO IT VARIES ON THE TYPE OF SOURCE HOW MANY UNITS WILL BE CREATED- WE COULD CERTAINLY- LOOK AT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS A SPECIFIC WHEN WE WILL BE RELEASED NOTICE THE FINAL BILL BILL FUNDING AVAILABILITY AS WELL AS ANNOUNCE OUR AWARDS- WE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE IN YOUR REPORT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE VERY RECENTLY THAT ARTICULATES ALL THAT INFORMATION BUT I APOLOGIZE THAT THAT SPECIFIC PIECE OF OUR REQUEST NOT GET IT TO ME I WILL WHILE WE CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING HERE AFTER MY COLLEAGUES TO OBTAIN THAT DATA FOR ME AND THEN IT WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU MOVING ON TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS THE STATE WAS ABLE TO MAKE A SIZEABLE INVESTMENT IN FUTURE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. HOW DD THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PROTECT THE CURRENT INVESTMENT. IN HOME KEEP PROJECTS. DO YOU WORK- BE MADE RIGHT NOW WE ALLOW DO MORE OF THE SAME IN TERMS OF ACQUISITIONS- WE WERE ABLE TO WITH THE- US EUROPE DOLLARS AS WELL SOME GENERAL FUND. FUND OVER SIX THOUSAND UNITS WITH HOKEY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY NINE FIRED RUBBER THE NUMBER CORRECTLY. SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE OF THE SAME AND THAT HAPPENED IN A VERY TIGHT TIME FRAME AS YOU GUYS AS YOU ALL KNOW. THE FUTURE OF COURSE HAD TO BE SPENT. ON A VERY SHORT TURNAROUND. AND DEMAND IS STILL ON GOING THERE ARE WE GET ASCOT QUITE REGULARLY WHEN THERE MIGHT BE MORE RESOURCES YOU MORE THE SAME THERE ARE MANY. PROJECTS AT THE STATE THAT COULD NOT MEET THE TIGHT TIME FRAMES OF HOKEY- GIVEN WHAT WE HAD TO DO WITHIN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD IN THE CALENDAR LAST YEAR. AND SO- THIS WOULD BE A NEW STANDALONE YOU KNOW NEW DEVELOPMENT NEW ACQUISITIONS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ALONG THE SAME LINES WHAT WE GET THE FIRST TIME AROUND. SO TO SPEAK TO WHAT I THINK ARE PROBABLY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IS WE DID. OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN ACTUALLY ASKING PROJECTS TO IDENTIFY FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION SUPPORT AND IN ALL CASES ARE ACTUALLY WILL PROVIDE TWO YEARS OF THAT. UP FRONT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD. A WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING THIS TIME. IN FACT PERHAPS MORE BECAUSE THE FUNDS WILL BE GENERAL FUND SO WON'T BE. ARMED AS INFLEXIBLE AS. THE FEAR HALF DOLLARS FOR. THIS YEAR WE COULD NOT FIND ANY SORT OF LONG TERM CAPITAL OPERATE SUPPORT. SO WE HAD ON THEM MATTER. FOR AND- SUPPORT THAT OF THE OLD. LAST TIME. AND WE'RE- THAT WE WERE ABLE TO. PROVIDE TO YOUR OFFERING SUPPORT TO ALL THE PROJECTS. WE WILL NOT BE A RESTRICTED THIS TIME AROUND AND HOW THAT WOULD WORK AS WE WOULD CAPITALIZE THAT OPERATING SUPPORT FRONT. JUST LIKE WE DID LAST TIME AND THAT IS PART TYPICAL FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- FINDING LONG TERM- RESOURCES. IS A CONSTANT CHALLENGE IN FACT- IDENTIFYING UP TO FIVE YEARS. IS NOT EVEN A STANDARD MANY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR FOUR HOUSING- OVER THE PAST YEARS AND DECADES. BUT DID NOT HAVE THAT OPERATING SUPPORT SO DEVELOPMENTS WERE FORCED TO YOU KNOW BY LOCAL SPORTS THE SORT OF THINGS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AREN'T. TYPICALLY PROVIDING LONG TERM SUPPORT LONGER COMMITMENTS JUST SAY NO PLACE LIKE HOME WITH A LOT OF CITIES SOMETHING. UP PRETTY INNOVATIVE AND- REQUIRE COUNTY RIGHT UP TO TWENTY YEARS. IN THOSE CASES WHICH WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND IS VERY HELPFUL. HELPFUL- BUT YEAH WILL BE DEBATING MORE THIS ABOARD OF PROJECTS. LIKE WE DID THE FIRST. I SENT AN MANY OF THE PURCHASE TO PRO REQUIRE WE ADDING LIKE THIS KITCHEN OR GENERAL WELL WE HAVE BEEN. HOW MUCH WILL THAT COST AND HOLD TO BE FUNDED. SO WE REQUIRED ALL THE PRODUCT AGAIN TO FILE THE FUNDING UP FRONT RIGHT SO- WE WILL HAVE A REPORT OUT AS REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE IN APRIL ONE WHICH WILL OUTLINE ALL ALL OF THAT IT WAS A MIX- OF. THE PROJECT REQUIRE WE HAVE MANY PROJECTS ARE OPERATING AS INTERIM HOUSING SOME INTERIM TURNING INTO PERMANENT HOUSING SO IMMEDIATELY IT'S PERMANENT HOUSE. THE PROJECTS THAT HAD. LOWER REHAB COSTS COSTS MORE PER UNIT UP FRONT. THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH MORE MOVE IN READY RIGHT IF YOU THINK OF A TYPE OF HOTEL OR MOTEL THAT MAYBE ALREADY HAD. SOMETHING LIKE A KITCHENETTE- SO THE AVERAGE KIND OF COST OF OUR ACQUISITION WAS VERY DEPENDING UPON UPON THAT LEVEL. SO- IT HARD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE ALL THIS PROJECT VERY- I WILL SAY THE PER UNIT COST WAS WAS VERY VERY LOW AND IN SOME CASES THEY WERE DEFINITIONAL SMALL REHAB DONE IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE RE HAVE COMING IN THE COMING YEARS AND THEY MAY THEY MAY USE LOCAL FORCES THEY MAY SEEK OUT TAX CREDITS AND- A REHABILITATION SOURCES THAT WAY IT VARIES FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE KIND OF A MORE. ROBUST KIND OF BREAKDOWN OF HOW MANY PROJECTS CAN FIT EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS- IN THE REPORT KAMALA JUST LITERATURE APRIL FIRST AND THE REPORT COMING OUT ON APRIL FIRST HOW IS THE DATA COLLECTED IS ARE YOU WILL YOU BE PROVIDING. INFORMATION ON AS TO HOW MANY ASSEMBLY SEATS HOW WHAT THE DATA WITHIN. THE ASSEMBLY FIFTH IT LOOKS LIKE. LIKE LIKE ABLE TO POINT TO COLLEGE IN CENTRAL AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND BE ABLE TO NOTICE- WHAT THE DATA LOOKS LIKE IN THAT REGION. SURE YEAH WE CAN PROVIDE THAT DATA THE PROJECT REPORTS WERE DUE TO US ON A PROJECT LEVEL ON FEBRUARY FIRST WE'RE THRILLED WITH STILL FINALIZING PULLING ALL THAT DATA- BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN SHOW A MAP. AS WELL AS A BREAKDOWN OF WHERE THOSE PROJECTS ARE. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE- THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT AND IF WE CAN IF YOU COULD PLEASE MAKE A NOTE THAT IN THE REPORT FOR APRIL FIRST THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO GET INFORMATION BASED ON. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON- BACK HOME AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED I WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. OF THE DITION ONLY PREVIOUSLY ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATIONS INCLUDED SET ASIDE FOR YOU. HOWEVER YOUTH SERVE THROUGH PROJECT FUNKY. SURE- SO I DO KNOW THE TARGET POPULATION WAS BROAD WITH THOSE EXPERIENCING AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN- BUT THAT HER PUBLISHING OF COURSE INCLUDES HOMELESS YOU. THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE HOME KEY PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY. SPECIFIC TARGETED HOMELESS YOUTH. IN THE CITY OF EL CENTRO. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY HERE. AND WE JUST ARE OBVIOUSLY PRELIMINARY WE- GETTING THE PROJECT REPORTS IT LOOKS LIKE AS MANY AS- TWENTY PROJECTS. HAVE OR GRANTEE THAT WE FUNDED HAVE HOMELESS YOUTH. THAT THEY'RE SERVING. NOT EXCLUSIVELY- BUT HAVE HOPE WITH YOU THAT'S PART OF THAT POPULATION THAT IS RESIDING WITHIN THOSE PROJECTS. SO HOW. WILL VERY HAPPILY BREAKDOWN THAT AS WILL THE SUBPOPULATION DATA. AS BEST WE HAVE IT. IN THE REPORT THAT WILL BECOME. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MENTION QUEST FOR A- OF THE L. L. AND FOR EARLY ACTION DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. YES SIR- I WAS THE HOMELESS IS A CRITICAL OF THIS IS A CRISIS AND WE NEED TO BE MOVING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO CREATE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF DEMAND COMING THERE WERE MANY WHILE WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO FIND WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUSION. LATER LAST YEAR- WELL OKAY OF DOLLARS TO DEAL FUNDS ON THE WAITING LIST WE HAVE THE FIRST ROUND. THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF INTERESTED PARTIES. INTERESTED COMMUNITIES TO DO HIS TYPE OF WORK AND WE THINK IF WE CAN'T DO IT FASTER WE SHOULD- IT HAS BEEN. VERY VERY HELPFUL TO GET MORE OF LARA HOMES CALIFORNIANS OFF THE STREETS. AND INTO THESE THESE HELICOPTERS. SO THERE PROP READY FOR PURCHASE AND RENOVATION TODAY. JUSTIFY THAT AMOUNT. WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT DEMAND YES SO WHEN WE PUT OUT THE MONEY LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED EVEN EACH REGION SO NOT JUST STATEWIDE BUT WE BROKE THE FUNDING DOWN BY REGION AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TO ONE. SO THAT WAS WHEN WE HAD THE RESOURCE FOR THE LAST YEAR WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY ARE TAKING A WAITING LIST RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FUNDS AVAILABLE BUT WE GET A LOT OF ENQUIRIES ABOUT WHEN WILL FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE SO WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO DEPLOY THOSE FUNDS WERE PRETTY CONFIDENT GIVEN THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION THAT HAPPENS NOT ONLY FOR HOME KEEP UP FOR ALL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS WHICH TYPICALLY AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TO ONE. WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THAT THE- AND WHAT CRITERIA. TO AWARD HUNKY FUNDING. THE FIRST TIME AROUND- THERE'S SEVERAL CRITERIA WORKS- ONE OF THE GREAT YOUR WE HAD HE IS THE FIRST TIME AROUND WAS ABILITY AND SPEED ON WHICH OU COULD ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY AND THEN LEASE IT UP WE WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THAT RESTRICTION OF COURSE BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CRITERIA WE TYPICALLY- EVALUATE WHEN WE ARE AWARDING PROGRAMS OF THIS TYPE END OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT SO. IT IS LEVERAGE OF OTHER FUNDING AND COMMITMENT TO OTHER FUNDING CERTAINLY THE ABILITY PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE SERVICES PLANTS ARE CRITICAL IT'S- BEING ABLE TO GET TO THE LOCAL PER UPPER HOLDEN AND READINESS AND OF COURSE THE THINGS ARE HAPPY TO ELABORATE AND IF I COULD TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU LIKE- WHO ARE THE KEY VENDORS THAT PROGRAM. TO REALLY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE LIST IF YOU'D LIKE- WE- HAVE BASICALLY THINK THAT OUR THRESHOLD AS WELL AS- THE SCORING TYPICALLY OUR PROGRAMS AND- WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT LIST OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL NO THAT'S OKAY YOU CAN SEND ME LIST THOUGH BUT IT ALSO DOES THE HUNKY PROGRAM INCLUDE A PLAN. TO FOCUS ON THE HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL. HEALTH ISSUES. SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CERTAINLY ELIGIBLE- AND THE FIRST AROUND OF COURSE YOU CAN HEAR DOLLARS THERE HAD TO BE A VERY CLOSE NEXUS TO COVER NINETEEN THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT NEXUS AS WELL AS BEING HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND OF COURSE WE KNOW WITHIN THE POPULATION ARE SIGNIFICANT TO PERSONS EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS SO- TYPICALLY HOW OUR COMMUNITY WILL PROCEED CERTAINLY AT ONCE THEY ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES IS WORK THROUGH THE RECORDED ENTRY SYSTEM- AT THE LOCAL CONTAINS OF CARE TO ESSENTIALLY- MOVE FOLKS FROM THAT LIST AND I SYSTEM INTO. AVAILABLE HOUSING AND WE REQUIRE THAT PARTICIPATION THE PROPOSAL IN WE ARE ALWAYS HERE THE SEALS EVERYBODY ELSE THERE SUPPOSED DEALING WITH HEALTH. BUT DOES THIS ADDRESS HOW THE HELL ALMOST WERE MENTALLY WHO DO NOT WANT TO BE HEALTH. WELL THIS PER PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR IS NOT SEEKING TO. FALL FOR THAT POLICY PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING FOR THE PULSE FROM OF ALL THE MANY MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS OF PROVIDING MORE HOUSING BECAUSE NO WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT- AT THE LOCAL OUTREACH LEVEL. OF COURSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT TAKES PLACE BUT THE HOME KEY PROGRAM IS ABOUT ASSISTING COMMITTEES ACQUIRE. THESE PROPERTIES AND HELPING GIVE THEM SOME RESOURCES TO OPERATE THEM LONG TERM- AND THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES OF COURSE ARE THE ULTIMATE PROVIDERS OF THESE OF THESE. BANKS AND- RUNNERS OF THESE- BUT STILL RIGHT SO ANY PROPERTIES. SO CERTAINLY WE ARE IDENTIFYING IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT. OF HOW WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. I WILL SAY THERE ARE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S FAR FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED OF HOMES- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA. WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THEY'RE NOT TO BE TAKE UP OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND HUNKY OR RATHER FORMAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE NOT TO THE WANT TO GO INTO THIS. WE HAVE A STATE PROVIDES THE MONEY IN THE PEOPLE SEE ALL TOO WELL YOU IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. A GOOD POPULATION THAT IS MENTALLY ILL I THINK IS MORE SIGNIFICANT. PEOPLE WANT ONE OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THAT SO IT IS THE GATEKEEPER THE MONEY- BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN A FOCUS MY SEVEN YEARS HERE. ON THAT PART AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING DOWNTOWN. ANYWHERE ELSE IN CALIFORNIA- YOU SEE FOLKS OR SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. AND WE WILL NOT PUT A DENT IN THAT. SO. LAST QUESTION. I MEAN A NO PLACE LIKE HOME PRO. IS BASED TO PAY. WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL. AND I. HOME RIGHT INTO THE THEIR PROP TO PASS A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THERE IS- NEAR TWO BILLION DOLLARS. MADE AVAILABLE AND WE HAVE. OVERBILLING OF THAT ALREADY AND- FOR NEW HOUSING UP BECAUSE THAT IS THE STATE PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TOWARDS. PEOPLE TWENTY HOMELESSNESS WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU THAT THE QUESTION IS. HOW MANY FOLKS HAVE YOU HEALTH THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. THEY WERE MILLENNIALS. EVERY IN THAT PROGRAM HAS TO BE EXPERIENCED HAVE TO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS SO. I CAN I CAN I CAN FEEL IT RIGHT FOR THE SECOND WILD WHEN ONE THING. ABOUT IT- WE DO FOR THE FOUR LARGEST COUNTIES THEY RECEIVED THE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES OF THE COUNTIES WITH OVER 5% TO RECEIVE THOSE AWARDS THROUGH THE STATE AND MINISTER THEMSELVES OF LOS ANGELES IN A CLASSROOM. A SINGLE COUNTIES. DID MINISTER THOSE FUNDS BUT BUT THIS THO OR BACK TO THE STATE THOUGH THEIR NUMBERS CORRECT. YEAH WE GET WE ONLY MOVING TO THE NUMBERS BUT THEY'RE YET SURE WE CAN I CAN TRY TO GET THOSE NUMBERS YOU. HEAR THE FRUSTRATING PART IS HEARING THAT WE HAVE NOT BILLS COMMITTEE SEVEN YEARS YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYSGIVING US NUMBERS BACK YOU GUYS NEVER HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. JUST GIVE THAT MONEY WITHIN COULD BE A MATTER OF ROUTINE TO HAVE INFORMATION ON NUMBERS AS A CHAIR AFTER EARLY FOR SOME MEMBERS IT'S ARCHITECT- IT BACK TO YOU THAT'S THAT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE- IF FOR GIVING US MONEY TO IMPROVE THESE THINGS. WE SHOULD HAVE METRICS TO MEASURE. IT REALLY AVAILABLE THE LEGISLATURE INSTEAD OF ASSESSING THE HEARING- GIVE BACK TO US SO. LET ME ASSURE THOSE I MIGHT GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN THE HEARING HAVE THEM RIGHT NOW IF YOU'D LIKE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS WERE NO PLACE LIKE HOME SO FAR. EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PER PROP ONE TO FOUR. THAT'S CAN. I APOLOGIZE THAT. THAT UNIT MAKE. THAT UNITS INDIVIDUAL HOUSE. THAT UNITS SO INTO YEAH IMPORTANT TO IGNORE THAT THE CURSE AND WE WERE FIFTY FIVE YOU YEARS OF A- WITH COVENANTS WITH A THE HOUSE THAT WE GET SO WE'RE SERVING FOR MORE. OVER THE LIFE THESE- UNITS AND PROPERTIES THAT JUSTICE WAS NOT THIS PERSON'S AND WAS OFTEN RATE THE EXISTING UNITS ACQUIRED BY THE FIRST ROUND OF. HUNKY FUNDING. WE'LL HAVEWE WILL HAVE THAT BY THE- APRIL FIRST REPORTS SO WE JUST GOT THIS PROJECT REPORTS ON FEBRUARY FIRST WE REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL OCCUPANCY- WITHIN. NINETY DAYS SO IT'S QUITE AGGRESSIVE OR THESE PROPERTIES- I DIDN'T ASK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE WHO HAS THE MORE UPDATE INFORMATION. BUT HAVING TO WE'RE STILL COMING THROUGH AS OFTEN THREE TO THIS PROJECT REPORTS SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES THAT WERE FUNDED OR CLOSED- ACQUISITION. IN IN DECEMBER FOR EXAMPLE. ARE STILL WITHIN THAT NINETY DAY CLOCK. SO THEY THERE ARE MANY OF THEM THAT ARE STILL THE THING UP THAT IS STILL QUITE- QUITE SIGNIFICANT AGGRESSIVE FOR MOST OF THESE PROPERTIES. US PRESIDENT- COMPARED TO NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES THERE. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER UP. FROM SAID I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS. CAN YOU PLEASE RUN DOWN AGAIN THE FIVE COUNTIES THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE THE BIGGEST- YEAH THE FLOOR ACCOUNTED FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO. ADMINISTER THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS. ON THEIR OWN IT'S LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA AND SAN FRANCISCO. GOT IT. SO WHEN WILL YOU HAVE THE REPORTS THE NUMBERS AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF THE FOLLOW THROUGH THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER COOPER IS ASKING FOR IN TERMS OF. THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THESE FOUR COUNTIES WHICH ARE THE LARGEST- IN USE ART AND I WOULD SAY L. A. COUNTY SPECIFICALLY TO A DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS SKID ROW IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED AREAS. WHEN WILL YOU HAVE A REPORT AND INTO WHETHER THE COUNTIES HAVE USED ALL THIS MONEY OR WHETHER THEY'RE SITTING ON IT. SURE THEY THEY WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR IN YOUR WORKS SINCE NOBODY COMES BEEN GOING ON- FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT THAT HAS BEEN BETTING- PORT IS AVAILABLE AND I BELIEVE HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED THE LEGISLATURE. PAST FEW MONTHS- CERTAINLY- THAT IS CAPTURED THERE BUT- WE CAN. WE CAN- WE CAN GIVE YOU THOSE NUMBERS AS SOON AS AS SOON AS WE ARE BUT WE DO HAVE A NEW PLACE TO CALL SPECIFIC REPORT WHICH I CAN SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE- BONUS HEARING CONFLICTING. YEAH I THINK PART OF THE FRUSTRATION THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING IS THAT. HOMELESSNESS CONTINUES TO RISE WE KEEP ADDING MORE MORE DOLLARS BUT WERE NOT SEEN ANY CHANGES- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY PART LOOKS FROM THE STATE. TO THESE FOUR COUNTIES AND MAKING SURE THAT. THE FUNDS THAT WE ARE ALLOCATING ARE BEING USED- AND TO BE HONEST NINETY DAYS ACTUALLY THINGS LIKE QUITE. LIKE A LONG TIME. TO RUSH SOMEONE INTO. TO PUT SOMEONE INTO A- A HOME. WHEN THERE'S SO MANY. SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE STREETS RIGHT NOW. SO YOU MENTIONED FIVE THOUSAND- THAT HAVE BEEN. PLACED IN NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND PROP ONE. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. I KNOW MR CHIU IS A HAS SOME QUESTIONS AND HE'S ON- FROM HIS OFFICE REMOTE IN HIS OFFICE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU MEDICARE. THANK YOU MANAGER CAN HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD GREAT THANK YOU LET ME LET ME FIRST START BY GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT'S DUE AND I DO WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROJECT HOME KEY. WHEN IT COMES WHEN IT BUT IT HAS COME TO THE SPEED OF DEPLOYMENT AND OUT FAST. YOU WERE ABLE TO MOVE ON THIS AS WELL AS- BEING ABLE TO JUST HOUSES AS MANY FOLKS AS YOU WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY I THINK- I WANTED ONE WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT UP FRONT- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT I THINK MANY OF US HAVE IS HOW WE MAINTAIN THIS PROGRAM IN THE MEDIAN AND SHORT TERM SO I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN THAT IN THAT AREA. SO SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS- THE STATE IS PROVIDING TWO YEARS OF CAPITALIZE RESERVES AND THEN THE EXPECTATION IS THAT LOCALS ARE HANDLING THE REMAINDER OF THAT FIVE YEARS- DO YOU HAVE COST ESTIMATES OF WHAT IT WOULD COST TO CAPITALIZE RESERVES FOR THE TYPICAL LIFESPAN OF A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNIT WHICH IS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF WHAT THAT WOULD COST OR OR- IF NOT FIFTY FIVE YEARS SOME REAL PERIOD OF TIME LET'S SAY TWENTY YEARS. OF WONDERING IF YOU'VE DONE THAT ANALYSIS. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SO IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT DOES DEPEND ON THE PROJECT FINANCING RIGHT SO TYPICALLY- AND- AGAIN PLEASE SHARE CONCERN THAT'S WHY WE ASKED FOR. IT TO START WITH THE FIRST PART QUESTION. CHIU CHU- D. THAT'S WHY WE ASK PROVIDERS IDENTIFICATION RIGHT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THESE PROJECTS FOR SUSTAINABLE ONE REAL. AND I WAS HE THAT WAS BASED ON. YOU KNOW THE ANALYSIS THAT AND THAT THAT THE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED RIGHT- SO I'LL HAVE GUNS WERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN. AND PROGRAMS IT IS SO- TO YOUR QUESTION QUITE OFTEN. A PROJECTS WILL BE SEEKING OUT VOUCHERS TO HELP SUBSIDIZE AS WELL THOSE MIGHT BE AS PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTIONATE DOCTORS OR THEY MAY BE- OTHERS ABOUT YOURS FOR VETERANS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE EITHER THROUGH INDIVIDUAL TENANTS HAVING VOUCHERS OR WHAT WE CALL PROJECT BASING OF THOSE DOCTORS MEANING THE- THE SUBSIDY IS TIED TO THE- APARTMENT OR UNIT RATHER THAN THE PERSON. THAT CAN CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF WHAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FROM AN OPERATING SUBSIDY RIGHT BECAUSE THE MORE INCOME COMING INTO THE PROJECT THE LESS THAT- ABILITY. IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME RIGHT WHERE WE WILL CAPITALIZE OF FRONTS- EIGHTY AN AMOUNT IS TYPICALLY TIED TO THE UNIT. IT CAN BE DRAWN DOWN FROM OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MANY YEARS. THAT AMOUNT OF COURSE LIKE I SAID CAN DIFFER BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OTHER. INCOMES OR RESOURCES ARE COMING. AND TO HOLD THE MOST COMMON MIGHT BE DOCTORS SO. WHAT WE DID EVEN WITHIN THE INITIAL HOME HE IS THERE OR DIFFERENT RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO EACH PROJECT AND SO THE WAY WE STRUCTURED YOU KNOW LUCKILY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A INITIAL COUPLE THE FEELING WE AS YOU MAY RECALL ONLY HAD FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. UP TO SPREAD ACROSS ALL ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS AND SO- IT DOES VERY DEPENDING UPON WHAT OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME THEY'RE GOING TO BE OVER AGAIN AND THE OTHER ASPECT THERE IS. WHEN YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES. THAT ARE OPERATING IN TERM HOUSING COMMUNITIES CHOSE TO OPERATE THEM AS INTERIM HOUSING FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD A REAL NEED- FROM A SHELTER BASED STANDPOINT WHEN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO COPE WITH NEED TO GET PEOPLE IN THE SIX SPACES- THEY'RE GOING TO BE OVER TIME CONVERTING THERE'S NO PERMANENT HOUSING IN WHICH CASE THEY'RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING SOME PROGRAMMING CAN EVEN OTHERS RENTS ARE LOW- THAT DOES CHANGE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC. AND SO IT IS TRUE COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHOICES. ARE AROUND THEIR RESOURCES WHAT LUCKILY THERE ARE NUMBER OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. LIKE MANY NATIVE SOURCES WITHIN THAT RIGHT THEY USE THEIR- PASSED SB TWO HOMELESSNESS FUND OF THE U. THERE HE FINDS THERE HAPPENS. THERE EMERGES SHELTER GRANT FUNDS THE RISKY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDS. THEIR PERMANENT HOUSING LOCAL ALLOCATION PLAN FOR THE ONGOING SOURCE THAT COMES FROM THE SENATE. SENATE BILL TWO FROM THAT SOURCE OF HOUSING SO THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF SOURCES AVAILABLE TO JURISDICTIONS. THAT THEY TAPPED INTO. IT IS ENTIRELY CORRECT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME CHOICES HERE- IN AN ONGOING WAY ABOUT HOW THEY OPERATE THOSE ALTHOUGH. I WILL SAY FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FOR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DEALING WITH THIS. THAT IS FAIRLY. THAT'S A KNOWN THING QUITE TYPICAL WHEN THEIR- ASSESSING HOW TO BEST USE THEIR HOMELESSNESS FUNDS THEY'RE OFTEN GOING TO CONTINUE. OPERATIONS SERVICES. WITH THE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS OTHER. OKAY SO I WHATEVER YOU SAYING IS WE WANT TO SET THIS UP FOR FIVE AND THEN IT SORT OF. GOOD LUCK TO THE LOCALS TO FIGURE THIS OUT- I GUESS WHAT I WORE WHAT WHAT I WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS THERE MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE. WHO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IN THE LAST FEW. WE HAVE MADE SO ONE TIME AND THAT'S AND HOMELESSNESS BUT WE HAVE NOT WE VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT AND AN INABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RELY ON GOING FUNDING. THERE AS YOU KNOW A DISCUSSION AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT HOW WE COULD CREATE A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THE REALITY IS- MAYBE WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY BETWEEN LOCALS AND THE STATE TO PROP THIS UP FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT LONG TERM WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN. I'M WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO COMMIT LONGER TERM ONGOING FUNDING- WHETHER WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO HAVE A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND- JUST ALSO JUST CONTEXTUALIZE THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS WITH PROJECT- RICKY IN HOMELESS AND HOCKEY WERE REPRESSIVE FOR THE SHORT TERM- BUT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS IN A COUPLE INSTANCES TENS OF THOUSANDS BUT WE'VE GOT OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOLKS. SO WE ARE TAKING CARE OF YOU KNOW- IT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROBLEM BUT BUT SAY 10% OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE A LOT MORE OF THE CHALLENGE TO ADDRESS AND I THINK THIS GETS AT THE FRUSTRATION MANY OF US HAVE. THAT WE ARE NOT. HAVING THE BIG PICTURE CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO BROWN ONGOING FUNDING PERMANENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND HOW TO REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THE. BIG PICTURE. YOUR THOUGHTS. SORRY ABOUT THAT IT IT WELL IT'S A DONE DEAL WAS JUMPING ON AND OFF. I'M MORE IN TERMS OF THAT WE NEED TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN- I MEAN. VERY PLEASED AT WORK AND HOME HE THAT I MEAN YES THE SCOPE OF OUR PROBLEM IS SIGNIFICANT BUT SIX THOUSAND UNITS ONLINE SEARCH FOR PERIOD IS. IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT I MEAN I DON'T THINK WE I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO MORE OF IT- YOU KNOW I WILL SAY A COUPLE THOUGHTS HERE. HAVING WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR QUITE A WHILE A LONG TIME AND MAYBE I'M EXPOSING THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET BUT- NEVER. IN THE INITIAL FOR SUPPORT HOUSING PROGRAMS THE STATE EMPLOYED IT WE ACTUALLY BEEN REQUIRE- OPERATING. RESERVES OR THE WAY THAT WE ASK FOR HUNKY RIGHT MAYBE THAT THEIR TERRIBLE SECRET BUT IT WAS QUITE COMMON. AND IS QUITE COMMON FOR SUPPORT HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BE HAVING TO FIGURE OUT THAT. EVERY COUPLE YOU KNOW EVERY COUPLE YEARS BECAUSE LOCAL COMMITMENTS WORKING YOUR COMMENTS YOU'RE GETTING WITH CARE. ARE HAPPENING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS RIGHT COUNTY CITIES. IN THE CARE AREN'T WILLING HERE NOT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO COMMIT TEN TWENTY YEARS. RIGHT THAT'S WHY NO PLACE LIKE HOME SO SIGNIFICANT. IN THE COUNTIES ASSEMBLY AGREEING TO TWENTY YEARS. OF OPERATING SUPPORT AND SERVICES. STILL TRIED TO BUILD ON THAT- OBVIOUSLY COULD DO MORE. I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE I THINK WITH GENERAL FUND RESOURCES CAN DO. MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN. THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHAT ONE BUT WONDERFUL CERTAINLY MORE THESE PRO. TO BE BY HAVE. HELP AND THAT'S WHY WE- GET AS MUCH AS WE COULD YOU KNOW WHAT. WITH THE- RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE THAT FOR THAT PER- LET ME OUR DEPARTMENTS WERE. HERE GOOD AND READY TO PARTNER IF THERE IS A- DECISION TO AWARD MORE RESOURCES AROUND. STRAIGHT WE HAVE. A LOT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE. RIGHT NOW WE ARE DEPLOYING MORE EMERGENCY RESOURCES OF COURSE- THE CASE ACT AND THE SORTS OF THINGS WHICH ARE. IN MOST CASES FALLING DIRECTLY BACK DOWN TO COMMUNITIES. AND OTHER SOURCES CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO DO ONGOING- MEDIATE NEED AN ONGOING- BUT I'LL JUST SIT HERE HAVING YOU KNOW WE ARE GROWTH THE PROGRAMS HAS BEEN. SIGNIFICANT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE ARE. DEPLOYING THEM HOPING. THAT JUST IF YOU ARE THAT THEY CAN MAKE AS MUCH IMPACT AS POSSIBLE. BUT THE PROPERTY A SKILL THE SKILL IS SIGNIFICANT RIGHT I HEAR IT FROM YOU GUYS- AND- FROM EVERYBODY IT'S- I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT SEEING SO MANY PEOPLE. ON THE STREETS THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS WORK THAT'S WHY WE ARE TRYING TO DEPLOY THE FUNDS IS. AFFECTED BY THIS POSSIBLE AS WE ARE TRYING TO DO MORE. SO YEAH MY THOUGHTS ARE. HAPPY TO STAND READY TO DO MORE. IF THERE ARE MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO. AND I WHAT I WOULD SAY RESPONSE I PREACH YOU SHARE. YOUR THE LITTLE C. WHICH WE'VE ALL KNOWN. AS THE FACT OF THE MATTER BECAUSE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET WE WERE COMPLETELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. NOW THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SECRET OF HOW DO WE FUND ONGOING HAVE OPERATED CITIES. IT'S GOOD WE'RE FINALLY TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER TO IT AND YOUR POINT- THE PROGRAMS WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVE SALT 345% OF THE PROBLEM. WE STILL HAVE I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW I'VE NO MISTRUSTED FOR. FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY COMMITTED TO FIGURE THIS OUT I THINK WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS. I HEAR YOU SAYING WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT MORE REVENUES BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT MORE REVENUES WERE HERE AND ON THE OTHER HAND. THERE'S NOT GONNA BE DISCUSSION AROUND A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ONGOING FUNDING IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IF WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CREDIBLY TELL. CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE A PLAN. TO ACTUALLY AND HOMELESSNESS IN OUR LIFETIME OR IN A GENERATION SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION I JUST HOPE THAT WE WILL REALLY. REALLY ENGAGE IN AND WHAT THIS ALL MEANS- THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT. IN THE SHORT TERM DURING CHRONIC VIRUS BUT I THINK. UNLESS WE REALLY STAND THEM UP WITH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A SHOT AT ENDING HOMELESSNESS WITHIN OUR OUR LIFETIMES. OF MILLION AND MILLION WITH. ONE FINAL QUESTION- S. MINISTRATION THING ABOUT A LONG TERM. FOR PROJECT HOME KEY. HOW WILL YOU HELP EACH CITY REALLY MEASURE. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM I NOTE FROM THE L. A- NOW SAYS THAT WHEN HE CAME TO. PROJECT ROOM KEY. THAT PROJECTS EXPERIENCED LOW OCCUPANCY RATES AMONG LEAST UNITS AND- IT HAD A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND JUST CURIOUS. HOW WILL YOU MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THISPROGRAM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHAT WHAT METRICS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON. SURE SO NO WE- DEFINITELY IT JUST TO BE CLEAR VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAM I KNOW THEY GET TIED TOGETHER QUITE OFTEN IN OUR DIALOGUE BUT ON VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF MECHANISM FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WE'RE PROVIDING. THROUGH HOKEY YOU KNOW PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS RIGHT- THAT AS OPPOSED TO TEMPORARY. SO JUST AS WE WILL IT AS AS WE WOULD FOR OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY SUPPORTER HOUSING PROGRAMS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE OF COURSE OCCUPANCY RATES AND TURNOVER- YOU KNOW. I'M NOT CONCERNED. FROM THE- REPORTS THEY BECAUSE WITH SO MUCH DEMAND ABOUT THERE BEING FULL OCCUPANCY OF ALL THESE PROJECTS- YOU'RE LOOKING AT- BUT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE METRIC STYLE I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST RIGHT AND I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I DID MENTION IT A LITTLE BIT I DON'T THINK WE DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB. TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENT AND WITH THAT SHE WAS OVER A LONG TERM. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE PER UNIT COST OF SOMETHING WHETHER BE NEW CONSTRUCTION OR SOMETHING EVEN MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE ABOUT ACQUISITION. BUT WE DON'T. TAKE IN YOUR MIND THE FACT THAT WE'RE SERVING HOUSEHOLDS FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS IN MOST CASES WITH THE SUPPORT. SO THAT'S LIKE MANY MANY MANY HOUSEHOLDS OVER THAT TIME. THAT GOES TO YOUR POINT AND THE POINT OF OTHERS AROUND MAKING SURE THESE ARE FIFTEEN. THE WAY WE DO THAT- I WOULD POSIT IS BY CAPITALIZING OPERATING SUBSIDY RESEARCHERS. AT THE AT THE OUTSET- THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING INTO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS. AND HAPPY THAT WE'VE- BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT- I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN. PROVIDE THAT SUSTAINABILITY AND THAT CERTAINTY. OBJECT LEVEL- WE WILL CONTINUE TO THAT CERTAINLY HELP KEEP ANY ANY SUPPORTER HOUSING KIND OF APPROACH I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT INCLUDES SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU'RE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE NEW CONSTRUCTION OR TICKETS TO THE ACQUISITION WHICH ARE ALSO CAPITALIZING AND A ONE TIME TIME UP FRONT ITS OPERATING RESERVE THAT CAN BE DRAWN FROM OVERTIME SO I THINK THAT'S A BEST PRACTICE THAT WE WOULD LIKE. SO AGAIN I HEAR THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. THAT YOU SHOULD THE THAT YOU SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT WE ARE. MAKING AN INVESTMENT FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS AND YET WE ONLY HAVE A PLAN TO PAY FOR THE FIRST. FIVE SPRITE SO. THAT AGAIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LONG TERM PLAN IS AND I DON'T SEE IT YET AND I THINK MANY OF US. ARE EAGER TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION OF AGAIN ONGOING FUNDING PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FUNDING THAT IS ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEED- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- AT THIS MOMENT SCRATCHING 5210% OF THAT. OKAY I'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU- THE NUMBER IT'S- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW. HOW THE PROCESS CAN BE COMPLICATED THERE ARE RESOURCES OF COURSE AVAILABLE TO DO THAT IF YOU LOOK AT. HOW WE LOST SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE BECOME OFFLINE IF THEY'RE BUILT TWENTY YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER I THINK IT BY ACROSS WHAT'S NOW. RIGHT WE HAVE AS COMMUNITIES AS- THROUGH THE VARIOUS RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL STATE FEDERAL LEVEL- MAINTAIN THOSE PROPERTIES THERE ARE. RESOURCES OF COURSE THROUGH A REHABILITATION TO TAX CREDITS THAT OFF AND ON YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS INTO THE PROJECT OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO. I WOULD EXPECT WE WOULD SEE MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- BUT I THINK YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE POOR BOY THAT WE'RE. CREATING- GROWING IT OVER TO AND WE'RE NOT LOSING. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL PRESERVATION WHICH SHALL I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GET YOU HELP THAT PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IT'S- IT'S- THE LONG TERM OPERATIONS ARE ABOUT PRESERVING. WHAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN. AND CERTAINLY. WE SHARE THAT GOAL. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AS MUCH THAT. IT HAPPENED THANK YOU PUBLIC PART OF THE CONVERSATION A MANAGER BACK TO YOU. THANKS THANK YOU OR SOMEONE AND THINK YOU MR ON. FOR THE DISCUSSION I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM. OUR COLLEAGUES MY COLLEAGUES IS A DESIRE TO WANT TO FIGURE OUT A MORE LONG TERM SOLUTION. TO THE FUNDING ISSUE THE UPPER. CURRENTLY THE OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR A TWO TO THREE YEARS SINCE NIGHT- IT'S NOT A LONG TERM WHEN. AND SO WE WANT TO WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT A NEW MODEL THAT WORKS A IN AN EFFORT TO REALLY PROTECT. THE HOME KEY INVESTMENTS AND WHAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AS WE- ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE MARGINAL FUNDING. US HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE- HOMEWORK SO WE HAVE A APRIL FIRST REPORT THE DATA SHOULD BE- PROVIDED IN TERMS OF- DIVIDED INTO ASSEMBLY. ASSEMBLY SEATS SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON NOR THE FUNDING IS BEING INVESTED- IN ADDITION TO. GETTING MORE INFORMATION FROM THE FOR COUNTIES LA SANTA CLARA SAN DIEGO IN SAN FRANCISCO AS TO. WHAT THEIR INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN AND WHERE THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED. NOW IN ADDITION TO MORE INFORMATION ON THE TWO PROJECTS RELATED TO- SERVICING YOUTH AND ALL CENTRO IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND YOU MENTIONED TWENTY ADDITIONAL PROJECTS- THAT HAD. NOT ALL BUT SOME. FUNDS DEDICATED TO HOMELESS YOUTH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT INFORMATION FROM YOU IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE DOING THE WORK NECESSARY TO HOUSE ON HOUSE CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS AND FOR BEING ON THIS PANEL LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ISSUE NUMBER TWO- WE HAVE A MISS SEAGER- MISS CRUZ AND MISS MORALIS THIS ISSUE IS RELATED TO INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE. GRANT PROGRAM LET'S BEGIN. MISSY AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS JENNIFER SPEAKER- I AM DE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS. EACH CITY IS REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. AT THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO PROVIDE GAP FINANCING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO SUPPORT HIGHER DENSITY AFFORDABLE AND MIXED INCOME HOUSING IN LOCATIONS DESIGNATED AND FELL. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION CURRENT YOUR RESOURCES AS AN EARLY ACTION ECONOMIC STIMULUS FUNDING AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TARGETED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REDUCE REMEDIATION OF BROWNFIELD SITES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY WERE REQUESTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO AUTHORIZE THAT THE GRANTS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR PREPARATION BE OFFERED ON AN OVER THE COUNTER BASIS. WITH A SPECIFIC DEFINITION OF QUALIFYING INFILL AREAS AND PROJECTS FOR SMALL JURISDICTIONS AND WHICH WE ARE DEFINING AS COUNTIES WITH A POPULATION OF UNDER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. ALBANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANA CRUZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH IS LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS REQUEST WILL NEARLY DOUBLE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INFO INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS WELL AS MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR BOTH TRADITIONAL- INFO AWARDS AS WELL AS SITE REMEDIATION I WOULD THINK AND CAN HELP BUILD UP MORE HOUSING. THANK YOU. WHEN I WAS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I APOLOGIZE I'M GOING TO KEEP MY CAMERA OFF AND HOPE IT STABILIZES MY INTERNET CONNECTION. I'M COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL FIRST RELATED TO THE EARLY ACTION REQUEST YOUR AGAIN ASK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S KINDLY EARLY ACTION AS WE ARE NEARING THE END OF. OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND- WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF ADDITIONAL ACTION THIS TIME. THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL WITHIN THE TOP DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RELATED TO INVESTIGATING AND REMEDIATING FRANKLY BROWNFIELD AS A MATTER IF IT'S OF THE OVERLAP IN THE- PURPOSES OF THESE PROVISIONS ATHLETE MAGICIAN TO SPEAK TO HOW THESE PROGRAMS WORK TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE PRIORITY WOULD BE FORWARD. FOR THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER COOPER MANAGER THANK YOU. HOW MANY BROWNFIELD SITES WITH THE TO A FIFTY MILLION EARLY ACTION FUND. WELL WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF EXACTLY HOW MANY SITES BASED ON AND HISTORICAL FUNDING UNDER THE PROGRAM WE ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE- ADDITIONAL HAS SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS COULD BE FUNDED. AS OTHER LIST OF SITES RUBIO PLAQUE FOR THE FUNDING. AND WE HAVE A THE NUMBER THAT WENT OUT INTO THAT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GENERAL FUND- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED SO WE DO HAVE KIND OF A BACKLOG OF PROJECTS THAT WE KNOW ARE READY TO. APPLY FOR FUNDING AND ANTICIPATE SOME OF THAT NOVEL WITHOUT THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL SITES THAT HAVE COME ONLINE. AND CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THESE SITES ARE CONCENTRATED AT. I KEEP PROGRAM FUNDS PROJECTS STATEWIDE- WE HAVE OLD IN LARGE URBAN. AREAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AS WELL AS SMALLER PROJECTS AND SOME OF THE MORE WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER MORE RURAL COUNTIES SO IT REALLY IS A STATEWIDE- FUNDING SOURCE THAT'S UTILIZED. IN THE L. L. RAISES QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THE REQUEST IS TIME SENSITIVE CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE. I GUESS I WOULD FOR ME BE TO DENY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE THE FIRST. STEP AT THAT QUESTION. SURE SURE HAPPY TO DINNER CRUISE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF THIS. OF THIS COMES- AFTER SINCERE VERSION OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN INVESTMENT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THREE. SO GIVEN THE COMPETITIVENESS IN OVERSEAS CHRISTIAN OF THIS PROGRAM- THE NEED FOR GIVING- FUNDING- BASICALLY SOONEST. AS POSSIBLE FOR- INTO INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE IS VERY IMPORTANT- AND THAT HAPPENED TO YOU- I REFERRED BACK TO EIGHTY ANYTHING ELSE ACT. I KNOW I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THINKING I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT- BASED ON THE NUMBERS WE WERE ALMOST AND- I HAD A PERCENT OVERSUBSCRIBED. IN THE EFFORT THAT WE ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND AND LATE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- SO WE ANTICIPATE THOSE PROJECTS- BUT I'LL BE MOVING FORWARD. UNDER THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION RELATED TO YOUR QUESTIONS MISTER COOPER AND THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM IF IT HAS WHY WOULD WE CHANGE THE FOCUS TO BROWN FILLS OF THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR THE CORE. I. I. G. PROGRAM. SO CURRENTLY THAT HISTORIC THE HISTORICAL PROGRAM. HAS PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION BUT THE PROGRAM CAPS. THE USE OF PROGRAM FUNDS FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT ABOUT. 20% OF THE TOTAL MAXIMUM AWARD. SO YOU CAN'T REALLY GET TO. THE REQUIRED REMEDIATION FOR SOME OF THESE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP. SITE SAID THIS. THIS FUNDING FOR THE BROWNFIELDS BUT REALLY FOCUSED IN ON THOSE SITES THAT ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP. BUT YET HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. AND COULD YOU SEE MORE HOUSING AND THEN THE- THE GENERAL PROGRAM WITH FOCUS ON MAYBE THOSE SITES THAT ARE LITTLE MORE. READY TO GO AND CAN KIND OF- ME THROUGH THE PIPELINE MORE QUICKLY. MISTER LUCKY YEAH THIS REAL QUICKLY THIS IS PROBABLY- ANSWERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A TO A SIMPLE-QUESTION THAT'S BEEN KIND OF TOUCHED ON WHAT WHAT STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE I. R. G. FUNDS TO SMALLER CITIES AND COUNTIES TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AS A MEMBER LACKEY- SO IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THERE'S A GROUP. OF CRUEL DISTRIBUTION OF IRAQI FUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THIS REQUEST ACTUALLY INCLUDES TRAILER BILL THAT TRIES TO MIRROR THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW A- THE POT- SET ASIDE FOR SMALL JURISDICTIONS THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING OF WORKS- AGAIN THAT'S PART OF THE IDEA. OF AN APPLICATION FUSION WILL KEEP ALSO KEEPING IN MIND THAT ARE CURRENTLY I BELIEVE IN THE REGULATIONS FOR I. G. THEY ALSO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION OF THE LOCATION. AND THE NEEDS OF THE- THE- OUT. OF PROJECTS IN APPLICANTS. I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT AND NOTE THAT THE NO FAT- PROVIDES TARGETING FOR VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS- SO WHILE THERE IS KIND OF A SET ASIDE FOR THE SMALLER. AND JURISDICTIONS THERE'S ALSO A REGIONAL TARGETS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING KIND OF THAT BROAD BASED DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS. AS A AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT. HOW MUCH WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR BROWNFIELDS AND SPONSORS TO A SMALL JURISDICTIONS. SO WE ANTICIPATE- TYING IT TO THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS KIND OF STATEWIDE THAT ACTUALLY MEET THAT DEFINITION OF THE COUNTY WITH LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION SO PROPORTIONALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY AROUND 15% OF FUNDS. PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE WTH A REPORT. ON WHERE THOSE- BUT WHERE THE GRANT PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S KIND OF IT'S A STATEWIDE PROGRAM BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE- THESE FUNDS ARE GOING TO. ANDIF SO HOW QUICKLY CAN YOU PROVIDE THAT. I AM I DON'T HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE- TODAY UNFORTUNATELY BUT- I. WORK TO TRY AND PULL THAT DATA THAT BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY OR AND POTENTIALLY BEFORE THE END OF THE HEARING. GREAT THAT WOULD BE I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW AND- TRUST- BEING. HAVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE FOR US TO SEE AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE WORK. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WITH YOUR FORWARD. I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMMUTER CAME OUT OF- IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT- I THINK I MIGHT HEARD THE ANSWER BUT- HAVE YOU PROVIDED A BREAKDOWN OF YOUR TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ALLOCATION. AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL US AGAIN HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS DID WE GET OUT OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUDGET ALLOCATION. ASSEMBLY TWEEN THE LARGE JURISDICTIONS IN THE SMALL JUISDICTIONS WE MADE AWARDS TOTALING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION- AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL- RESULT IN. JUST OVER SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS OF WHICH ABOUT SIXTY THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE WOULD BE- AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SIXTY THREE SO I IT'S HARD TO DO THE BACK THE ENVELOPE. YES BUT THAT'S FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. THAT HOW IT'S PLAYING OUT. OKAY THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH PAST INFRASTRUCTURE. GRANT PROGRAMS. I AM I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE KIND OF PER UNIT COST WAS FOR- THE IG PROGRAM FUNDED UNDER ADAM FORTY SIX BUT WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT AS WELL AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MESSIER AND EVERYONE FOR- THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO- AND LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION- TO THE REPORT STATEWIDE AS WELL AS THE COMPARISON PER THE PER UNIT COST THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT TO HAVE AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE HOUSING LAW ASSISTANCE. WE HAVE- MISS KIRBY MR CRUZ AND MISS MORALIS. LET'S BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THIS IS MEGAN COULD BE I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING POLICY AT EACH CITY AND SO IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING LAWS THE PROGRAM THIS IS THAT REQUEST WERE MAKING TO SUPPORT OUR- IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING LAWS AND RANGING FROM HOUSING ELEMENT LAW KNOWN AT LA LA AND HOUSING CAN ABILITY ACT AND SEVERAL OTHERS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BASICALLY THERE TO- I. HOW SIX UNDERSTAND THEIR OBLIGATION- AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING THEM IN THE INTERESTS AND GREATER HOUSING PRODUCTION AND- MEETING OF OUR HOUSING BUBBLE. THANK YOU MR KIRBY MISTER CHRISTMAS BROTHERS. DANA CRUZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THANK YOU. THE LEGISLATIVE ACT THIS YEAR THE COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE STATE'S HOUSING SHORTAGES IN THIS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP THE STATE YOU NEED ITS HOUSING GOALS I'M IN THE AGENDA THAT THE STOCK MARKET. IDENTIFY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE RAISED FOR CONSIDERATION REALLY FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MAJOR QUESTION OUR MIND IS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD PRIORITIZE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE VERSUS THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENTS- THAT IS ALSO A PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE IN YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU SO INTO OF THIS HEY TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTACT- IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND ENCOURAGE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND WE HAVE A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- WE HAVE PLANNING GRANT HEALTHCARE SECTION COMPLY FROM THE START. AND WE ALSO HOSTS NUMEROUS MEMOS AND RESOURCES ON OUR WEBSITE HELP MAKE THESE COMPLEX LIVES EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPLY WITH- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ABOUT EVERY TEN YEARS WE GET TO DO A DEEP DIVE WITH EVERY JURISDICTION DURING THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROP THAT- TO REVIEW THEIR HOUSING PLAN AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PLANNING FOR. REMOVING BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING THEIR DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN IN THEIR IN THEIR JURISDICTION AND MANY OF A LOT OF HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED IN RECENT YEARS- AND SO THAT THAT WE KNOW THAT A LOT AND BURKE FOR JURISDICTIONS TO CATCH UP WITH- AND CERTAINLY THE WORK THEY WERE DOING CAN'T PREVENT EVERY AND ALL COMPLIANCE ISSUE FROM FROM HAPPENING- SO CURRENTLY WE TYPICALLY RECEIVE REQUEST EITHER. FROM JURISDICTIONS THERE- ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE LAW OR REQUEST AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ADVOCATES ARE DEVELOPERS THAT MIGHT BE SEEN POTENTIAL HOUSING LAWS BY LEECH AND- SO WE ALWAYS START CURRENT TECHNICAL OF THE TEMPERATURE- WE TRY TO SPEAK RESOLUTION THAT WAY 99% OF THE TIME AND- THAT THAT- OF THAT VIABLE PATH-BUT- SHOULD NOT BE WE CAN ISSUE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND ENGAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- AND THE PROPOSAL REALLY COMES OUT OF OUR LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT WORK THAT. WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING MORE PROACTIVE- WORK TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS UP FRONT I AM OFTEN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMING TO OUT THEMSELVES- VERY LATE IN THE PROCESS- WE ALSO WANT TO AMPLIFY THE TECHNICAL THINGS WE DO NOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE CHANGING THAT THE COURSE OF THE EVENT FOR MORE THAN JUST ONE INCIDENT AND THAT TIME- AND I'M ALSO REALIZING THAT THIS WORK IS INCREDIBLY NEW ON. HIGH LEVEL TIME. CONSUMING- AND WHEN WE REALLY- DA WANT TO LOSE THAT THING I FOUGHT FOR- AND THERE. THERE IS MORE DEMAND- I'M THEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP KEEP UP WITH. AND BUT IT IN EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. I WE SEE A IS. I TYPE OF THE- IS THE BIG WE DON'T EVER. BERMAN AND FOR. THAT WE ASSUME THAT EVERY WANTS COMPLY. AND WITH THE LAW AND IF IT. IT'S JUST A LOT THAT- TO KEEP WITH AND THAT APPROACHES GIVE AS PROOF- A COUPLE BLACK THE- BACK OF. OUR PRIORITIZE A WHEN CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR THE WILL BE. A HDD A REGULAR TO PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE PROGRAM AND HOW THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WORK FOR THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU AND SO THAT IN TERMS OF REGULATIONS THAT'S NOT ENVISIONED AT THIS TIME- THIS IS- WE HAVE A SET OF HOUSING LAWS THAT WE ARE GIVEN AT THE READY HUMOR BURKE NUMBER FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS. ANY GENERAL AROUND AND WE DO SPELL OUT ON OUR WEBSITE THAT THE PROCESS- OF THAT. I. T. A. APPROACH FIRST. AND LOTS OF NOTED THAT JURISDICTION- SHOULD THERE BE ANY ISSUES OPPORTUNITY FOR MEETINGS AT THAT TRACK- BEFORE ANY AG INVOLVEMENT IS IN PLACE BUT A LOT OF THAT KIND- IS JUST BUILDING OUT STATUTES THAT GIVE. GIVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLARITY AROUND- AROUND THE PROCESS OF ENGAGING THE AG. I'M ON HAVE BEEN LOCKED. HOW IT HE CAN ENGAGE THE AG ON HELPING. GOT IT OKAY THANK YOU IT SEEMS LIKE WE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THEN IF. THE REGULATIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. SAT CORRECT. YES NO NO REGULATIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE THERE- DOES THAT LEGISLATION IS FAIRLY CLEAR AND PROCESS HERE BUT- BUT IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS YOU BUDGET BACK AND- WHERE WILL HAVE A TICKET STYLE. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY YEAH I JUST HAVE A REAL QUICK QUESTION HERE IT HAVING COME FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING WHEN THE STATE SENDS ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE AND TO OVERSEE YOUR PLANNING PROCESS IN YOUR DAILY WORK. I JUST WONDER IS THERE ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY WHAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE MISTRUST. I'M AYE I HOPE IT IS IT DOESN'T COME ACROSS AS MISTRUST- BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. I DON'T THINK SO- WHERE WE HAVE- A LOT OF OUR REPORT BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT HAS BEEN- ON THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN PLANNING GRANT- WHICH WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. I'M GOING INTO A HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE BEFORE- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT GIVEN HOW MUCH THE BAR HAS BEEN RAISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVER TIME. AND FELT THAT THAT THE FRAME THAT WE START FROM- BUT WE DO ALSO GET LOTS OF COMPLAINTS FROM- FROM DEVELOPERS WHO ARE HITTING A WALL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT EVEN WHEN THAT OCCURS WE DON'T START FROM PLACING A STRAP. ON THERE'S ALWAYS MEDICATION AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- BUT YOU WANT TO THE SITUATION- AND IT IS VERY OFTEN A LOT. AND YOU KNOW WE DO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMING FROM AND OUR OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR THEIR OBLIGATION- THEY THEY HAVE A LOT OF POWER IN THE SITUATION TO MAKE DECISIONS OVER THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES WHERE. THE BURDE IS ON THEM QUE TO JUSTIFY SAYING NO TO OUT TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE TO WONDER FINAL A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WILL. THESE H. S. C. D. PEOPLE BE OUT WANDERING CITY PLANNING COMMITTEES AND DAILY. WORK IN THE PLANNING OFFICES AND COULD YOU ME AND IF THE QUESTION A LITTLE BETTER. YEAH OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE GOING TO. THE CITY PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETINGS WHICH ARE REGULARLY EVERY MONTH. ARE THESE HUD OFFICIALS GOING TO BE THERE TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. BECAUSE THAT THAT KIND OF. SET FOR LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALSO. JUST THE DAILY WORK OF THE PLANNING OFFICE IS THIS GOING TO BE KIND OF A- PERMANENT PLACEMENT OF SOMEBODY THERE. I WOULD ENVISION- THAT KIND OF AND RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT- I DO HINK THAT WE- ARE INTERESTED IN IN- AS AS AS OUR COLLECTIVE WORK BUILDS IN IDENTIFYING AND ANALYZING POTENTIAL CAUSES BEYOND BEHIND THEM LOW HOUSING PRODUCTION AND THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN A COMPLAINT BUT WE'RE WE'RE SEEING AND- THAT REALLY WHAT THE TROUBLE MEETING A HOUSING GOAL WE MIGHT WANT TO I'M TRYING TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE POTENTIAL COGNIZANT THAT. THAT MIGHT AND COVERS SOME ISSUES AND NON COMPLIANCE BUT I MIGHT OFFEND COVER AND POLICY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH OTHER CHANNELS SO AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT AND- I DIDN'T GET THAT CERTAINLY AT MY ROOM MY VISION OF RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT WOULD NOT BE STARTING FROM AND SITTING IN. ON EVERY PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETING. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT MATTER. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ONE TEN OF ELEVEN HERE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO YOU MIGHT IF I JUMP IN WITH A QUESTION. GO AHEAD- I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO JUST I GUESS PRESENTED DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE ON THIS COMMITTEE I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA- I THINK THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT ARE. ABIDING BY OUR HOUSING LAWS IN THIS AREA BUT THEY- IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT CALIFORNIA IS THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND THERE ARE MANY DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF VIOLATIONS BY DIFFERENT CITIES. FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAW WITH THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WITH DENSITY BONUS LAW WITH ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAW AND- AND I FOR ONE OF VERY MUCH SUPPORT- THIS SUPPORT AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAWS ARE FOLLOWED BY ALL CITIES AND IT SHOULD JUST BE SOME CITIES- THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE FOR FOLLOW UP FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION IS- IT'S ONE THING TO FOLLOW- HOUSING LAWS AROUND PRODUCTION BUT AS WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH AN EARLIER ITEM SO MANY CITIES ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS AND ADDRESSING- WHETHER WE'RE BUILDING THE NAVIGATION CENTERS AND SHELTERS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THIS BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE A SENSE THAT THERE IS MUCH. THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RATE CD CAN LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO REQUIRING JURISDICTIONS TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE TYPES OF SHELTERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS COULD YOU. SHED A LITTLE I KNOW AND I WOULD I'D LOVE TO RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH AND THE QUIET PART. AND THAT'S GOOD QUESTION. YEAH THAT- THAT THAT BAY AREAS OF ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THAT EIGHTY SEVENTY TO PROVIDE A TASTY BE INCLUDED ALL HOUSING ELEMENT LAW- BUT ALSO HAVING HAD ABILITY ACT AND LAND USE DISCRIMINATION. I THINK AND I MENTIONED IT ONCE BEFORE I THINK A LOT OF CASES INVOLVED. AS LOOKING AT THAT- THE WHOLE SET OF HOUSING LAWS. AND BUT I THINK HOMELESSNESS OFTEN FALLS INTO ONE OF THOSE THREE CATEGORIES- SO UNDER HOUSING ELEMENT LAW THERE ARE A LOT OF OBLIGATION JURISDICTION HAVE TO BE DOING IN TERMS THAT. ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD HOUSING PARTICULARLY AND FOR HOME WITHIN THAT THAT CAN AND HELP ALLEVIATE OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS- AND IN PROVIDING- EMERGENCY SHELTER- BY RIGHT AND OTHER OTHER THINGS INTEL. AND UNDER HOUSING ELEMENT LAW THAT WE HAVE THAT A LOT AT A LOT AND- PURVIEW THERE. AND AS WELL AS UNDER HOUSING CAN ABILITY ACT AND EVERYTHING THAT THE BIG PLACE WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF THE AMOUNT IS AND THE DESIRE TO- TO PAY NOW AND JUST A REMINDER THAT WE HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AS PROVIDE A LOT OF PROTECTION. AND IF HOUSING IS GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO. AND ADD TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND- HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT. WELL I I'M I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT IN AGAIN IS WHY IT'S A PO FOR THEIR TO BE. AND FOR OF THE LAWS IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THESE LAWS O JUST BE ON THE BOOKS BUT- IF CITIES I MEAN WE KNOW. ARE ALL I THINK MANY OF US HAVE BEEN LOCAL OFFICIALS AND IT'S OFTEN WHEN YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SAYING NO TO A PROJECT- IT'S EASIER LOCAL OFFICIAL TO TURN A BLIND EYE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO JUST REMIND EVERYONE OF THE OBLIGATION WE ALL HAVE TO FOLLOW- THESE HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS. TYPICALLY THE WAY THAT- SAY THE HOUSING ELEMENT THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS ENFORCED AS BY SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BUILD THIS HOUSING. WHICH PUTS THEM IN A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION VIS A VIS A CITY OUR PLANNING DEPARTMENT OR CENTER NEIGHBORHOODS OR A LOCAL CITY COUNCIL AND TO HAVE. A TO HAVE A STABLE.

FULLER ONLY COVER A PORTION OF THE BILL AND I'M SORRY THAT IT TOOK FOR ME IN FACT COMING BACK ON. YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE- WILL A SPECIFIC PROJECT AND WHAT OPPORTUNITY THERE WILL BE TO BACK THE LEGISLATURE TIERNEY AND MARKET OUTLOOK BUT THE OUTSTANDING. I WOULDN'T BE HERE AND IN ADDITION WE ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S LONG TERM PLAN IS TO ENSURE THAT THE BACK OF BUT IT'S FULLY ADDRESSED. AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO PREVENT. A GROWTH IN. IN MAY ISSUES- YOUR CENTERS THANK YOU. OKAY I AM SO YES YOU'RE CORRECT WE DID IDENTIFY AN ESTIMATED FIFTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS INCLUDED THAT AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THIS REQUEST- NOTING THAT THESE ARE YOU KNOW THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES FOR THE MOST KRYPTONIANS AMBIENCE INSPIRED. HIS MOST CRITICAL LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS- LIKE SEWER WASTE READABILITY PROJECTS WHICH AND POTENTIAL CUT AFFECT THE HEALTH RESIDENTS AND ALSO SOME OF COSTA PROJECTS FIRST WHICH THEY WE BE ON MY TO GET WHAT AN OPERATING OR IS FUND. SO WE BUILT AT CAN ROUTE REPAIRS CITING- OTHER THAT WE'D BE LOOKING TO TAKE CARE OF WOULD BE- ACT EDA- REMEDIATION PROJECTS. AS WELL AS- ANY OTHER URGENT NEEDS THAT TEND TO POP UP AS AS THINGS TEND TO- BUT THE- MASS PROGRAM SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STORM EARLIER THIS WINTER BLEW OFF TO COUPLE THE ROUTES THAT ONE OF OUR MIKE AND CENTERS AND SIX AND- SO OF A SUDDEN THOUGHT. THAT RIGHT IT'S NOT GONNA BE HIGHER ON THAT PURSUE LAST- AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HOW WE WOULD PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ENDS REPORT BACK ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS YOU EIGHT ZERO DEGREES TO PROVIDE- IN REPORTS. DETAILING WHICH PROJECTS- ARE UNDER CONTRACT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED- AND THE AMOUNTS OF FUNDS REMAINING ENCUMBERED EXPEND THAT. I'M OUT OF THIS. THE SAM CLANS. I IN TURN OF A SEEN I'M GOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND PREVENTING THE ACCUMULATION OF SYSTEM OF BACKLOG AND THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION NUMBER STILL HONESTLY THINKING THAT THROUGH. I MEAN AB YOU KNOW CURRENTLY AS I MENTIONED. BEFORE IT C. RECEIVES AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND JOYFUL FUND IN GENERAL FUND. FOR THE PROGRAM AND- THAT SUBSIDY IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH RENTAL REVENUES- FOR THE PROJECTS BUT SINCE BOTH HAVE BEEN STAGNANT OVER AND MANY YEARS AND WITH- WITH- YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM FURTHER EXACERBATED WITH NEW LEGISLATION TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH ALLOWS INSPIRED CENTERS TO STAY OPEN FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME UP TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. KERN COUNTY YEAR INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS PER CALENDAR YEAR THE WEAR AND TEAR AND THE CENTERS AS FOR THE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED pNEEDS SO WHAT WE RE LOOKING AT DOING IN THE FUTURE- EXPLORE OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES- YOU KNOW. PERHAPS AT SB TWO WHICH PROVIDES A DEDICATED ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE FOR HOUSING. I INCLUDING THE EXAM FOR SENATE AGRICULTURE WERE BROUGHT A HOUSING AND RENTAL AND SET ASIDE. LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY PERHAPS USING SOME OF THAT WAS TO ASSIST WITH THE M. DEPARTMENTS BACKLOG. AND SAM WE WILL ALSO REFER. A RINSING. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE OF THE RIGHT NOW I'M- JUST EVEN IF YOU WERE RENTS ARE OUT RENTS RANGE FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS A DAY AT MOST THE SENSORS WHICH- ENDS UP BEING AROUND FOR IN A FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF UTILITIES SO GRINS INCREASES YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE TO BE- IT WOULD TAKE US AWHILE TO GET RENTS UP TO. A LEVEL TO WHERE THEY WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IN ADDRESSING. AT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SIX AM. AND AT THE REPAIR MEANS. SO- YOU KNOW I CAN SAVE. AC IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING OUR REVENUE BUDGETS INVOLVED IN ONGOING PLAN. TO JUST AS LONG TERM DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS- AND ANY REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- WOULD BE MADE THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU MISS SUGGS- JUST A FOLLOW UP. QUESTION TO THAT SO YOU ARE REQUESTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE NEEDS BUT WHAT IS THE TOTAL NEED TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS- EVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED TO THE TWENTY FOUR MARGARET CENTERS. THAT AMOUNTS OPERATE SAY I HEARD YOU SAID THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY A PLAN OR SOME KIND OF- WAY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT BY WHEN WILL YOU KNOW. SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HIRED A CONSULTANT TO GO TO PHYSICAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT AT ALL TWENTY FOUR CENTERS AND- BASED ON THAT INFORMATION. MA'AM WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS LIST THE NEED- ACCORDING TO THOSE REPORTS THERE WERE- PUTS ME TEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF PROJECTS THAT. HAS ALREADY LAPSED AND THE SEVERITY OF THESE REPAIRS CONTINUES TO INCREASE- I MEAN AND THE OTHER THINGS YOU AS YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE ENFORCED USE LIMITED PROGRAM FUNDS SECOND ACTS PATCHWORK I'M FEELING SYSTEMS WELL THESE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS ARE NOT BEING RESOLVED- SO. THE PROBLEM KEEPS MOUNTING OVERTIME- IN THE AGGREGATE I BELIEVE THE PNA IS IDENTIFIED ROUGHLY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF CRITICAL REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE NEEDS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITHIN. A FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME AND THEN IT ALSO PRODUCES SCHEDULED BY RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE AS AM I AM DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- EXPENSES OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW AT FIFTEEN YEARS SO WE BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE INFORMATION AND THOSE. PNA REPORTS TAKING A LOOK AT OUR ARE PROJECTED REVENUES AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN AND A SYSTEM OF ON GOING REGULAR MAINTENANCE. GOT IT OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.

THE DINNER CRUISE THE OF FINANCE THAT WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW THE- I PORT OF THIS. IT'S REALLY CONTINUE TO MEASURE THE WHOLE MAXIMIZE THE INVESTMENT IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET OTHERWISE IT COULD RESULT IN OUR VERSION OF FUNDS AND THEREFORE- PROJECT POTENTIALLY FALLING THROUGH AND THEN REDUCING. OTHER POTENTIAL HOUSING STOCK AND IN REGARDS TO THE EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR LEGISLATIVE WORKLOADS PROVIDES RESOURCES TO HELP YOU SEE THE STREAMLINED- AS REQUIRED BY LAW THERE HOUSING PROGRAMS UNDER DELIVER- HOUSING FINANCING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK LOL. YOUR THE- IF YOU FROM OUR RELATED TO THE IRAQI LIQUIDATE X. IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DATA MENTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE OVERALL EFFECT ON CLIENT PROJECTS AND PUSH THAT OUT IT WOULD MEAN ABOUT THE CAPACITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE ON PROJECTS WE HAVE NO COMMENTS RELATED TO THE WORKLOAD THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY TO ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OUR PRODUCTS. NO SANE MAN JUST ONE QUESTION FOR ME AS. FOR THE LIQUID ACTION THE LIQUIDATION PERIOD EXTENSIONS DOES H. C. D. HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY PROJECTS WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED ON A CASE BY CASE. BASIS YEAH WE'VE- REACHED OUT TO THE AWARDEES AT THOSE FANS WE HAD ABOUT SIXTY ONE AWARDEES AND TOTAL AND IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT THIRTEEN OF THOSE SIXTY ONE HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY MAY. HAVE A NEED TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION IT'S REALLY A MIX OF BOTH LARGE JURISDICTIONS AND SMALL JURISDICTIONS AND IMPACTS- VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE. GOT IT THANK YOU FOR THAT IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL. YES I'M HERE I ALSO HAVE INFORMATION ON THE AYE AYE G.

ACTUALLY THAT BE GREAT LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT- WHAT ISSUE IS THAT- I BELIEVE ISSUE TO. YOU ARE CORRECT ISSUE. TWO THERE WAS ONE QUESTION ON THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND PROP ONE SEED PER UNIT INVESTMENT AND- THE CALCULATION WAS CORRECT IT WAS JUST ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PER UNIT FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FUNDING. AND THEN FOR PROP ONE SEE IT WAS- ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PER UNIT- AND PROP ONE C. WAS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO- I THINK IT'S KIND OF A AT A REASONABLE- INCREASE IN THE EXPENSES- BASED ON THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH THOSE AWARDS WERE MADE. AND TO YOUR QUESTION ON THE REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FUNDS JUST ONE NOTE THAT WE DID MAKE ALL FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE SMALL JURISDICTIONS SO WHILE ONLY APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE FUNDS FOR THE LARGE JURISDICTIONS- WERE MADE WE DID ALLOCATE- ALL OF THE SMALL JURISDICTION FUNDS WHICH REPRESENTED ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. OF TOTAL FUNDS- FOR THE BREAKDOWN OF THE LARGE JURISDICTIONS WE HAD ABOUT 45% OF THOSE AWARDS COACH YOU- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA APPROXIMATELY 53% OF THOSE AWARDS TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 2% TO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AREA WE WERE UNDER SUBSCRIBED TO THE- THAT 2% REPRESENTS- ALL ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED. THERE WERE A COUPLE JURISDICTIONS THAT CAME IN UNDER THE SMALL JURISDICTION POTS WHICH WERE LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND AREA. BUT ONLY LIKE ONE OR TWO. EXCELLENT AT YOU FOR THAT UPDATE AND IF I MAY ASK CAN YOU PLEASE SEND THAT OVER TO THE BUDGET STAFF SO THAT WE CAN I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET THOSE NUMBERS CONFUSED.

COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS THE SCALE OF THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IT'S SIGNIFICANT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAPPENS YOU INTEREST. IN INCREASING THE STATE'S ROLE IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THE STATE ACT VERY QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS AND EXPAND EXISTING PROGRAMS USING WHAT KIND RESOURCES. DURING THE PAST TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED RISK. TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION DURING THIS TIME. AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET OR THE CA TO HOME AND THE AFFORDABILITY. BY PROPOSED AND TO SIX RESOURCES A ONE TIME BASIS. IN THE PAST THE BILL TIME TO RESOURCE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS. THE ONGOING CHALLENGE RELATED HOMELESSNESS AND HOW FOR. I'M ALSO SEVEN IF YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ROOM TO PROVIDE A CLEAR SHOULD A LONG TERM STE WE- THAT THE COUNCIL WORKING THAT THREE. THE PLANET THAT THE CRIED. ON. IT WILL DRAW. LOOK FORWARD TO COULD. TO ENGAGE IN THIS. MEN OF BUDGET MR TANG WAS IN THE ROOM BUT HE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO STEP OUT TO TAKE A CALL BUT HE DID ASK THAT I ASK A QUESTION ON HIS- THEY HAVE BEHALF. SO FOR- FOR THE HAP. ROUND ONE IT LOOKS LIKE HOW NEEDS ARE TAKING LONGER TO GET THEIR DOLLARS OUT RELATED TO FIGURE TWENTY. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY BARRIERS THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT COUNTIES WILL GET THEIR DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE. YES I DO BELIEVE THAT WOULD THAT WERE WORKING ACTUALLY. CAN'T INCREASES AND ON BOTH. WOOD COUNTY CITY THERE VIA THE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW KEEP WITH ALLOCATED COMPARED TO HOW HOW HAPPENS AND BAND- IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SORT OF THE SPENDING DATE HER FOR HALF WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE FUNDS WILL LIKELY BE IF THEY SAY THAT AT THE CURRENT RATE THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE BACK WELL IN ADVANCE OF THAT FIVE YEAR MARK. AND WE CAN BE THINKING IF I CAN'T LAUGH AND LEARN AND MAKE SURE THE FUNDING HAPPENS MORE QUICKLY OUT OF THE GYM TODAY RIGHT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY PRETTY SURPRISED AND IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THAT I COULD HAVE GOTTEN HER FOR HALF A STARK. YEAH ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY IT. YEAH EACH. AND A CERTAIN ASKED YOU. A LITTLE. TO YOUR MIKE. BECAUSE YOUR YOU ARE FADING AWAY. AT THE END OF YOUR OF YOUR SENTENCES. SO- CAN I THINK I MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT THE YOU MENTION WHERE THE BARRIERS TO USING THIS TYPE OF FUNDING- AND WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR BOTH PEOPLE AND HELP IN TERMS OF THE BARRIERS I WILL SAY CAN BE WE'VE HEARD CONTINUALLY. THAT FLEXIBILITY AROUND BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY CRITICAL PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR GIVING SOME VERY UNEXPECTED NEED. I CAN I CAN GO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT SEEING. THAT THE ACTUAL THERE ARE VERY FEW VERY GOOD FOR THE PROGRAMMING AND- REALLY VALUABLE AS PART OF LIFESAVING I'M REASON THAT SHOULD HAPPEN CREDIT CALL I THINK THE ONE THING WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SOME TECHNICAL THE BOND RIGHT NOW. IS JUST AROUND CAPACITY BUILDING AND STAFFING- THAT THERE HAD BEEN I'M JUST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES COMING INTO THAT IN A COMMUNITY THAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO WITH EIGHT AS YOU ALL KNOW HOW. IT CAN HELPING FOLKS THINK THROUGH I'M JUST AFTER THE FACT AND ACTUALLY BUILD THAT CAPACITY FOR THIS KIND OF INCREASE IN RECURSOS THAT HAPPENS ON THE NETWORK REPEATING I CLOSE I AM. RIGHT TO CATCH THAT LAST NIGHT I YOU MENTIONED PRACTICE I'M SORRY I MISSED AND CAN USE THE YOU. KIND OF. I'M TO A LITTLE AT THE END CAN YOU THAT LAW SENTENCE. I'M WE'RE PROVIDING HAVE BEEN OF THE AROUND HALF. HE AND EVEN MENTIONED- BACK PRACTICES MIGHT BE K. LOG IN HERE ME OKAY. CALL YEAH YOU KNOW I'D LET FOR A OF AND HAVE YOU CALL IN BECAUSE YOUR YOUR VOTE HE SAID TO IN AND OUT AND SO GETTING OF WHAT YOU'RE- PHILIP POTS FROM HOME- WELL YOU. TECHNOLOGY. THE. I DIDN'T. BOB GOOD LUCK WITH. OKAY. YEAH PROBABLY LOOKING. FOR I WOULD HAVE A RESTRAINING ISSUE THAT THE BETTER NOW. YEAH YEAH LAST YEAR FOR A FEW MINUTES I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. I MEAN CAN YOU JUST CONTINUE SPEAKING AND WE CAN GO WHERE ARE YOU CALLING IN OR IF IT'S YOUR LAST NAME. AND I THINK I'M HAVING. OF MY INNER ISSUES HOLIDAY ABOUT THAT BUT I WAS I WAS GET A DIVE INTO REAL QUICKLY AND I'M SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE NEED AND BEING ABLE I'M FROM THE PROGRAM. QUICKLY MAKE HER HOPEFULLY THE INTERNET HOLD FOR ME. I WE HAVE THINKING I WOULD SAY SOME REALLY EXCITING FACT PARTICULARLY AROUND. SOME OF THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IN COORDINATION EFFORTS- WE'VE BEEN THINKING I DON'T. FROM CITY THE AND FROM FROM CONVENIENCE CARE REALLY THINKING THREE STRATEGICALLY WHICH PIECES OF THE PUZZLE ARE ARE BEST SERVED FOR EACH OF THEM IS EVERYTHING FIGURATIONS WHERE I THINK MIGHT BITE. OUT OF THE NAVIGATION CENTER INSIDE OF THE OPERATION BACK AND SEE IF HE WILL TAKE ON THE ACTUAL ONGOING OPERATION COSTS. I'M REALLY THINKING THROUGH WHERE EVERYONE'S SKILLS AND CAPACITIES ARE PERSISTENT GREAT I'M IN A JURISDICTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE ALSO SEEING IT'S BETTER PARTNERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP IN THESE COMMUNITIES FROM FROM SOME OF OUR GREAT HEAT. PARTNERING WITH PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES- LOCAL. LOCAL CALIBRATION SEE THINGS BY FAX IT REALLY THINK VALUABLE AFTER. AND ENCOURAGE THAT TO BEGIN- AND ALL JUST MAKE WE ARE SEEING. SOME REALLY X. WORK AND. NOT SURE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YOU TO CALL IN. WE CAN YOU FINE. OKAY SORRY EVERYTHING. I THINK IT CAST OUT OF A CALLING IT TO START THAT SO I'M AND WE JUST A MENTION ON IN THE HOMELESS THANK SEEN THEM EXCITING- JUST DEEPER BACK HOME INTO OF HOW SERVICE AND THEN ENTER THAT ARE PASSED DO YOU THINK THINKING OF THE WHOLE OF ENTERED THEY NEED. I REALLY UNDER THAT THAT THE SERVICES NEED TO POPULOUS GIVEN THAT THE U. BUT IF I FOR BOTH OF THESE CONSTRAINTS ARE THINGS THE RIGHT WORKING AND I WE'LL WE'RE TRYING TO HI. THANK FOR THAT I THINK BE R. WOULD BE REALLY GREAT TACK GET THE FROM YOU. AND ROY INTO OF SOME. THAT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RE IN THE WHEEL. I WE THINK OF NEW PER. AND WHERE FUNDING. THIS LOCALS WERE ALLOWED TO USE SOME OF THEIR HE BEEN HAVE DOLLARS FOR PROJECT ROOM KATE. AS PROJECT ROOM KEY IS REIMBURSED WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THE LOCALS HAVE TO PUT THESE DOLLARS BACK INTO HE PERHAPS. HEY MATE MIGHT HAVE MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. INTO THAT QUESTION I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING. I KRYSTLE COMPARTMENT OF FINANCE- BROADLY SPEAKING WE HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING- LOCALS TO USE HE GONNA HAPPEN MONIES FOR PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT BEING PERSONABLE. UNDER FEMA SO THAT WAY WE'RE USING. OUR BEST UTILIZING OUR RESOURCES NOT SORT OF DOUBLING UP SO TO SPEAK SO WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE USE. EVEN HAPPENS FOR. NON FEMA REIMBURSABLE PURPOSES BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT LOCALS MAYBE USING SOME EVEN HAPPEN MONEY FOR SOMETHING A REIMBURSABLE PURPOSE I DO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENTS. THEN WE ARE ENCOURAGING THEM TO GO AHEAD AND TO RE USE THAT MONEY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WAS INITIALLY GIVEN WHICH WAS FOR SERVING THE HOMELESSNESS SUPPORT. FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY TO HAVE A QUESTION COMING TO OKAY. YEAH I'M ONE OF THE FOCUS ISSUES THAT I HAVE- DEEP CONCERNS OVER AS FAR AS AS HOMELESSNESS POPULATION OR THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE DRUG ADDICTIVE OF FOLKS THAT I THINK MAKE UP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO. SEE ANY PROBE. PROGRAMMATIC INTERVENTIONS ALONG THOSE FRONTS WITH THESE FUNDS IN MY MISSING SOMETHING. CAN YOU TELL ME ARE THERE ANY PROGRAMMATIC INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OR THESE ADDICTIVE- CIRCUMSTANCES. YEAH I THOUGHT THAT THE FUNDING FOR BOTH KEEPING HALF ARE NATURALLY QUITE FLEXIBLE THEY HAVE A RAID AVAILABLE USE THAT COMMUNITIES EXPECT A FUNDING ARE GIVEN THEIR LOCAL NEEDS AND SO WE ARE TRACKING THINGS I WILL MENTION THAT THAT THAT THE RATES OF PEOPLE BEING SERVED THAT ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. ON THE DEFINITION OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS OFTEN INVOLVES HAVING A DISABLING CONDITION OF BEING HOMELESS FOR AT LEAST A YEAR SO IS THAT THE FOLKS WE'RE SEEING IN THAT POPULATION I'M OFTEN MIGHT BE SOME OF THAT THAT THE FOLKS YOU'RE REFERRING YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT THAT THAT THE FUNDING IS INTENTIONALLY QUITE FLEXIBLE AND SO WE ARE SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES AND. ANY ERA. WHAT ARE I APPRECIATE THE OF. I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE K. PIECE. AS TO GETTING SOME KIND OF. THAT THEIR- DIRECTED BY. TO FOR THE FOR PROBLEMS AND YOU TALKED. OF SOME NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BEING HELPED BY THIS FUNDING. I WONDER WHAT QUALIFIES AS HELP AND HOW LONG AND SUSTAINED- THESE IMPROVE CONDITIONS ARE. SO IT REALLY VARIES AS WE KNOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE OUR HOMES FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS ANY GARY VERY DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS TO BE I THINK WE AND TABLE YOU READ OUT SO THAT THE RANGE CAN BE EVERYTHING FROM PREVENTION DOLLARS WHICH CAN BE. VERY SHORT TERM ASSISTANCE A PERMANENT PART OF HAPPENING FOR THE WE ARE ENCOURAGING COMMUNITIES SURELY INDIVIDUALIZED THAT THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY IN SERVICES THAT THAT. I'M PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR COMMUNITY ARE ARE ARE NEEDING INSTEAD OF THE RANGE CAN BE QUITE QUITE DRAMATIC- BASED ON THE BALLOT FROM AND MAKE ME SO I WILL JUST MENTION IN TERMS OF- WITH THAT KIND OF INTERVENTION YOU'RE SEEING THAT THE NUMBERS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. AROUND CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS- I'M JUST PULLING HIM UP HERE REAL QUICKLY JUST ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE- IN HEAT WHO ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS I'VE BEEN CERTIFIED THIS PROGRAM. I NEVER REPORTED SEEING I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME ABOUT HOW MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE PART OF THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND MORE PERMANENTLY I DID A DIFFERENT HOUSING BUT SERVICES CAN BE EVERYTHING FROM STREET OUR REGION I CAN'T MINUTES. SERVICES THESE ARE QUITE A FEW COMMUNITIES DOING SANITATION STATIONS ARE NOT RECORDED THIS YEAR CHIU BUILDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS ALL THE WAY UP TO PERMANENT THE FACT. REMAINS A PART OF HOUSING. THE THANK YOU THAT I THINK A YOU KNOW HOW THE DATA READY TO SHARE WITH VERY. IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE CAN YOU PROVIDE US IN WRITING CAN YOU PROVIDE TO THE BUDGET STAFF THE NUMBER THAT YOU JUST SPOKE ABOUT. YEAH THEY'RE ALL IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT WERE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. MISS OUT OF HERE IT IS FALL UPON ON MY COLLEAGUES SELECTEES. ISSUES WITH THAT YOU GOT SIXTEEN THOUSAND HAVE BEEN HELPED AND HE HE SAID. THAT'S IN VARIOUS STAGES CORRECT. SIXTY SIX SEVEN HAVE BEEN INSURED FOR DINNER A STATUS ON THAT 660-001-6000 CHRONICALLY HOMELESS YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT PORTION OF A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AS FAR AS HELP. CAN YOU QUANTIFY WHAT THAT WE SEE THERE HELPED. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY. BUT THE RANGE WILL BE WILL BE ABLE VERY SO IT WILL BE EVERYTHING FROM STREET OUTRAGE TO SHELTER THE FIRM. SO AVERAGE COULD BE AN OUTREACH WORKER TALKING TO THEM AND NOTHING. CHANGING THEIR WHATEVER THEIR OUTCOME REALLY LIVING ON THE STREETS STILL CORRECT. WELL ESPECIALLY WITH IN REGARDS TO COPE WITH THIS YEAR WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF OUTRAGE AND PROVIDING I CAN GET ACCESSORISED REALLY CRITICAL LIFESAVING WORK THIS YEAR I'M SO THAT DOES KEEP THEM SAFE AND THE METHOD AND I THINK WE CAN REALLY MINDFUL ENCOURAGING. COMMUNITIES TO USE THE FUNDING AND THAT WAY I WE YOU KNOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT CAN TAKE MULTIPLE POINTS OF CONTACT FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS THAT IF I'M SHOPPING TO. TAKE TRUST AND COMMODORES AND SO OFTEN THAT IS AN IMMEDIATE- CONNECTION AND THINK THAT OKAY KEEP GOING BACK OUT TO DO THAT REGION BILL BACKTRACK BEFORE SOMEONE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT AYE SHELTER. THE PROBLEM IS WE SPENT OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT THIS TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD IMPACT ON THAT NEVER HEARD ANYBODY FROM THE FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. TALK ABOUT FEES CHRONICALLY. THE HOMELESS FOR. THE FOR MIDDLE ILLNESS SUBSTANCE. AND THESE FOLKS ARE THAT- QUALIFY UNDER FIFTY ONE FIFTY. BECAUSE NOT A DANGER THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. BUT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE NO ONE EVER MENTIONED THAT ABOUT ME A PROGRAMMER WEEK. WE TAKE CONSERVATIVE THESE FOLKS AND GET OFF THE STREETS. AND GIVE THEM. SHELTER SOME MILLS CLEANED UP. AND THEN IF ANY MEDICATION BECAUSE SOME FOLKS WITH A- MONSTER MEDICATED THEY'RE ABLE TO GET YOU KNOW. IT'S WITH THE CHIEF SOMEONE OF NORMAL. IN IN IN IN MY SEVEN YEARS HERE NO ONE'S EVER TALKED ABOUT THAT. WE'RE STILL THROWING MONEY AT THIS PROBLEM AND THAT DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE SOME THAT THAT THAT SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL THEY CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR- NOT YOU THAT REACH WORKERS TALK TO MORE YOU WANT. BUT EVEN TODAY IF THEY CAN'T MAKE DECISION FOR HIMSELF. THEMSELVES AT WHAT TIME DOES THE STATE STEP IN. AND BE THE ADULTS THE ROOM TO MAKE THAT DECISION I'VE NEVER HEARD FROM ANYONE FROM ANYONE IS ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY SAYING THAT. IT IS HIGH TIME WITH A CONVERSATION WITH THAT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS FOLKS. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE CHRONICALLY. HOMELESS THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL AND THAT HAVE SUFFERED ABUSE PROBLEMS. SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHAT I WOULD SAY THE NUMBER THIRTEEN THOUSAND THAT HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HOW A PORTION OF THOSE WHICH I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON WORK CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND WITH PERMANENTLY HOUSED. AND WE DO BELIEVE MAKING AN IMPACT ON THAT I THINK YOU ALL WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WORKING FOR GATHERING FROM THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE SEEING. MORE CONCERN AROUND AND PEOPLE THAT ARE LEGALLY HOMELESS COMING INTO THE SYSTEM- BUT BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PERMANENT HOUSING EFFORTS SO THAT THESE ARE NOT POSTED ARE STAGNANT AND ON AN ONGOING AS HOMELESS BUT THAT ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM- AND ANNUALLY YOUR HOUSING. I'M AT QUITE A FEW FOLKS. IN THE CITY IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AND DELETE WE ARE FIGHTING UPSTREAM IS LAW IN THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND THAT WERE HELD. WHAT IS THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT ARE STILL BEING HOUSE ASSEMBLY REVERT BACK. TO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE I KNOW PORTION OF THEM. HAVE THAT. BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH GROUPS GETTING STAY MONEY. THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN. STATE OR LOCAL HOUSING FOR SHOULD BE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO GET THOSE NUMBERS HOW MANY FOLKS HAVE HAVE LEFT THAT HOUSING AND GONE BACK TO THE STREETS. IN MY IN MY SWING THAT WRONG. NOT ONLY THAT WE DO NOT PORTION OF FOLKS DEFAULT FALLBACK INTO HOMELESSNESS I'M NOT THAT IS SOMETHING YOU TRACK CLOSELY ARE H. I. F. SYSTEM WHICH I MENTIONED IN MY INITIAL REMARKS WILL BE ABLE TO ALLOW AFFECT OKAY YEAH EXACTLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND- I'M YOU KNOW RETURNS HOMELESSNESS. AS WE COLLECTIVELY WE DO EXPECT- THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY OUR NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT WILL FALL BACK INTO HOMELESSNESS. I AM BACK BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW WE USUALLY TRACK EXPENSE INCREMENTS. AND FROM EVERYTHING AROUND FOR TWO YEARS YEAH I'M VERY KEEN THAT I IMAGINE HAVE BEEN ALREADY ADMITTED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. I HAVE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND NOT PERMANENT. I WOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK IT BACK BUT IT IS DATA THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO BE ABLE WAY ABLE TRACK IDENTIFIED THREE. SO YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA THEN. NOW YES YEAH YEAH YEAH BEABLE TO A THE NUMBER. OKAY HOW SOON WE SEE THAT DATA THAN. THE ONLY THING THAT GRAYSON SYSTEM GO LIVE AT THE END OF THE MONTH- WE WITH THEIR MANY TO ABOUT AND THAT THAT'S THE FIRST ROUND WE WON'T THAT DATA THE FIRST ROUND. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL IT WILL BE AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS LEAVING AT SOME POINT IN DOING THAT NOW LIVE HERE FROM YOUR AGENCY AT SOME POINT. TO TALK ABOUT THOSE FOLKS THAT CAN MAKE THAT DECISION COMMUNITY IF THEY DON'T WANT TO COME IN. ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. IT'S A MOOT POINT. BECAUSE WE CAN'T FOR SOMEONE TO KILL AND- THE- HEALTH. CORRECT WE ARE HOUSING BIRTHDATE WE CANNOT REQUIRE HELLO OKAY SO WHAT WE GONNA DO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE THAT DECISION WHAT WHAT IS YOUR GAME PLAN- YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW FOR MY- MY COLLEAGUES POINTED SAID MR ON THAT POINT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. MORE FOLKS EAGER TO COME INDOORS THEY HAVE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY FOR AND SO I THINK THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF- OF UNITS AND BANDS AND SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF FOLKS. WHO ARE EAGERLY AWAITING SUPPORT THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY ACCESS TO. I MISS THE I THINK. THE CONVERSATION THE PART MISSING AND THE RESPONSE IS THAT YES THERE ARE. LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CAPABLE THAT NEED ASSISTANCE THAT YOU ARE HELPING HOWEVER. THERE IS A LARGE POPULATION OF MENTALLY. THE FOLKS THAT ARE HAVE A MENTAL DISABILITY MENTAL DISABILITY THAT DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE A DECISION FOR THEMSELVES HOW ARE WE HELPING THEM AND WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THAT THAT PARTICULAR POPULATION AND THE THING IS THE COMMITMENT DECISION. A OVER IS CALLED A FAMILIAR WARM CLOTHES I'M NOT GONNA BE HALF NAKED HAVE MY SHOES OFF. I'M A TRYING GET FOOD I'M NOT DIG INTO TRASH CANS I MEAN. IT'S TO ME IT'S A THESE FOLKS THAT ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL- HIGHER NEED. AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE. AN ERROR I GUESS THERE THE MORE DIRE STATE. I THINK PRETTY WITH A COMMENT ON THIS. RIGHT YES NO MATTER COMING ON THIS ISSUE YES MISS THOMPSON GO AHEAD THANK YOU BRING IT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE TWO PROPOSALS MOVING THROUGH A DIFFERENT SUB COMMITTEE THEY DO ADDRESS BEHAVIOR OF BEHAVIORAL NEEDS. PLEASE THERE'S THE KALANK. AND THEN THERE'S THEY- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROPOSAL THAT I BRIEFLY MENTIONED EARLIER THIS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. AND IT WILL BE USED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COMMUNITY IF YOU WANT SPECIFICS OF THE ON THOSE PROPOSALS I CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK TO MY HOPE AND HEART HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KILEY. DIRECTIVES BATH- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT ACTIVE RENEWED PRIORITIZE THESE THINGS SO. I DON'T THINK MANAGER MANAGER IF I COULD JUST MAKE IT IT'S MORE COMMON THAN IT IS A QUESTION. THE FRUSTRATION THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM MY COLLEAGUE AND I WERE BOTH HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE OF MANY MANY YEARS. AND RIGHT NOW THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE AVENUE OF PROTECTION THAT MANY OF THESE. PEOPLE GET CAUGHT IN AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT- ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AND THE CUSTODY IS THE ANSWER FOR PROTECTION AND IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND THERE'S A HIGH SENSE OF FRUSTRATION. THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS LEFT AS THE AS THE CARE GIVERS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO FIX. AND THAT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO. BE A SUPPORT NETWORK AND- PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. AND WE KEEP FUNNELING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD AT THAT. BUT WE'RE NOT GOOD AT IS PROVIDING THE SERVICE IN THE SUPPORT THAT THESE PEOPLE DESERVE. AND THAT'S IF YOU HEAR FRUSTRATION FROM MY COLONIZED BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT WE'VE LIVED IT. AND SO IT'S VERY VERY REAL TO US. AND SO. WE'RE JUST ASKING. FOR MAYBE SOME CATEGORIZATION. ON WHAT HELP MEANS AND IS IT REALLY HELP OR IS IT JUST. YOU KNOW AND I BILLION OBLIGATION BECAUSE WERE FUNDED TO DO SO THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. AND SO WE'RE JUST REALLY TRYING TO PROVIDE THE HELP THESE PEOPLE DESERVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER LUCKY TO HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. I WOULD I WOULD. SAY THAT I THINK THAT- TO- BRITNEY POINT THAT THAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET DOES ACTUALLY HE GOT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PUZZLE THAT WOULD. WOULD PROVIDE RECIPE I THINK THAT IN SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT WERE AT WORK I THINK RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THEY HAVE INTEREST YOU I'M I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THERE'S FURTHER DISCUSSION. ABOUT THANK YOU I WOULD ALSO ADD- IF I HEARD MISS THOMPSON CORRECTLY IT'S THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS ALSO IN THE SAME LINE. OF THE ONE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE IN THE PAST OF ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS HE NEEDS TO BE A PARALLEL. LINE IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH- ISSUES REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WELL AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF HOUSING AND FUNDING FOR THAT. ADDITIONAL QUESTION HOW WILL THE H. CFCS- ACTION PLAN DO. THE COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES. THE WHOLE PLANET BEEN DONE AND BRING. BY THE THANK MEMBERS- THE DIFFERENT. AND WHILE I COUNT MEMBERS TO THE LOCAL. IN SOUTH YOU'LL SEE AN ACTUAL PLAN ITSELF- INTERACTIVE ABOUT OUR WEBSITE RIGHT NOW AND AS- DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE ACTIVITIES FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SO DID NOT. WORKING YES THE STAFF ARE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WE WILL BE TRACKING A FOR NEEDING IF IT'S LOCATING THAT WORK. BUT MUCH OF THAT WORK IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE BY DEPARTMENT. SO IT'S- VERY ACTIVE PARTICIPATION- FROM ALL ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS. THAT REPRESENT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STILL A COMMON ARE GREAT OF. IF YOU COME IS JUST THIS TO FIRST OF ALL I WILL TO CONCUR IN THE COMMON OF OUR COLLEAGUES ABOUT HOW- OUR CITIES BUT PARTICULAR THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THE INCREDIBLE TRAGEDIES ON OUR STREETS INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WE HAVE SOME PARTIAL SOLUTIONS ON THE HOUSING FRONT WE- HAVE AS YOU ALLUDED TO SOME ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE- BUT THE REALITY IS OUR- OUR LAWS ARE NOT EQUIPPED OR CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS OR OTHERS. TO ADDRESS THE- THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND FRANKLY THE FOLKS ARE DYING ON OUR STREETS- BECAUSE OF THE RULES WE HAVE IN PLACE AND SO. I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO ECHO- OUR DESIRE TO RECEIVE FROM THE MINISTRATION IF YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS IN THIS BUDGET SORT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND HELP BUILD A NOT BECAUSE- THAT'S AN ONGOING FRUSTRATION OPTICALLY FOR MY CITY AS WELL AS I THINK EVERY CITY IN OUR IN OUR STATE. AND I DO ALSO WANT TO ECHO SOMETHING THAT OUR OUR CHAIRMAN SAID WHICH IS- HIP HOP OUR OUR OUR ONE TIME PROGRAMS- BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE LONG TERM ONGOING CRISES THAT WILL NOT A GET DRESSED IF WE SOLVE IT OR WE TRY TO SOLVE IT IN A- IN A PERMANENT WAY AT THIS MOMENT WE'RE ALL HEARING FROM OUR CITIES. THAT THE ONE TIME FUNDING IS GREAT BUT THEY CAN'T COUNT ON PERMANENT FUNDING AND IF THE ONE TIME FUNDING GOES AWAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN A WORLD OF HURT SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN THE POINT I MADE EARLIER JUST SOMETHING I CAN IMAGINE- THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WOULD AGREE WITH. ABOUT THE NEED FOR AN ONGOING FUNDING STREAM FOR THESE SERVICES AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO- A COUPLE QUESTIONS I HAVE- I ONE THING THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS THAT HE HAS SERVED IF I DID THE MATH CORRECTLY- FOURTEEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE. PASSED AND I ASSUME THAT HAS SOME AND TO DO WITH THE- PROGRAM. OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NEWER- COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THE DISCREPANCY IS SO SIGNIFICANT SO HE PRESERVED OVER. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOLKS HAPPENS ONLY SERVE FORTY SIX HUNDRED FOLKS. SO JUST HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT AND ALSO. I KNOW CAP WAS SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON REGIONAL COORDINATION. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THAT WORK ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES. TO FACILITATE THAT REGIONAL COORDINATION WORK WHICH WE KNOW IS SO IMPORTANT TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE DIFFERENCE YOU'RE SEEING AND HE COULDN'T HAPPEN FIRST TERM IN IN ALMOST ENTIRELY YOU TO WHEN THEY- WERE RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL. HE HAD OVER A YEAR AND A HALF AND IN TERMS OF I DOLLARS AND THEY HATE IT IF BROWN'S SO. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN HAPPENED ABOUT FIVE MONTHS OF THE SERVICE THE CITY I'M OVERSEEING AND KEEP IT OVER TWO YEARS. EIGHT SO THERE'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TIME AT THAT I MEAN. AND SO I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY HEARTENED BY HOW QUICKLY HAVE GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND AND OKAY STARTED SERVING PEOPLE SO. I THINK I'M- A I'M- TO STAY TUNED FOR APPRECIATING REPORT I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT WILL BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS FROM. I'M NOT FUNDING STREAM- IN TERMS OF A PARTY NATION AND BEST PRACTICES. NO I THINK WE HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HEFCE PARTICULARLY DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M IN IN RELATION ARE FUNDING BUT ALSO OTHER FUNDING. EIGHT I'M GONNA TELL PUBLIC MEETINGS THROUGH REGIONAL PARTNER NATION INTO ONE BEING- EARLIER THIS SUMMER I BELIEVE IT WAS IN JULY. WE PUT OUT A STRATEGIC SPENDING GUIDE TO REALLY THINK ROOM WITH A DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE RECEIVING I HAVE ASKED THAT. SEPARATED THOSE FUNDING- STREAMS AND WANT TO USE THAT ONE SO REALLY BRING. CITY THE RECEIPT BECAUSE OF OUR FINDING AT ALL YEAH- AS WELL AS THE STP FUNDING AS WELL AS COUNTY THAT RECEIVED BOTH YES ASK. FROM WITHIN. AND HE AND HALF OUT AND AS WELL AS THE IF HE'S EVER GETTING DIRECT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND. A COUPLE. YOU KNOW A COUPLE A FAMILY THING THAT THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY WERE CITIES ARE OUR MOST I'M- TRYING TO ACTUALLY BE THE ONES TO PURCHASE- ADDITIONAL. ADDED TO NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE EMERGENCY SHELTER AFFECTS YOUR FEET ARE MORE FACTS TENTATIVELY DO THAT THE OPERATIONS OF THE FINDINGS ARE USING- I THINK HE HE- HE FUNDS TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY BACK AND HAVING TO SEE I SEE YOU THERE. I'M ACTUALLY KEEPING ONGOING THREE THINK THAT HANDFUL OF THAT KIND OF WORK. AND BUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY HEARTENED BY AND WOULD STAY IN THE PAST PRACTICE. IN ADDITION THE DIFFERENT FUNDING ENTITIES THAT WE START I THINK WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME REALLY GREAT LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH- SOME OF THE USED PROVIDERS THAT THAT ARE ARE OUT THERE ARE PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES. AND EVEN OUR CALTRANS BUT THERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND THAT OF A LOCAL LOCAL PARTNERSHIP WITH CALTRANS THAT APARTMENT NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED FOLKS IN INTO THAT- BY A LOCAL SHELTER THERE SO. REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES I THINK HAPPENING THIS FUNDING SELF. OF THE LINE COULD BE. THE GREAT. PROJECT THAT. I HAD ONE SO OF QUESTIONS DATA. AND AS YOU KNOW IT'S WE DISCUSS A YEARS AGO I HAD A BILL. THAT WOULD CREATE THE DATA WHERE AND I TO SEND AN I'M AS X. AS I THINK YOU ARE. A HOW CLOSE YOUR TO LAUNCH IN THIS DAY. WAREHOUSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE MORE FROM WE HAVE THE BETTER WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE- SORT OF TWO FOR QUESTION TO WHAT OU'RE DOING WITH THAT DATA. ONE IS- YOU KNOW THE IDEA FOR THIS IS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO TAKE THIS LOCAL DATA AND THEN USE IT TO BETTER TARGET. SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL WONDERING IF THAT NEXT STEP IS GOING TO HAPPEN SORT OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO STATE PROGRAMS. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS- THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE NEED FOR A GAPS AND NEEDS ANALYSIS AND BY THAT I MEAN. IT'S ONE THING TO KNOW WHAT LOCALS ARE DOING CURRENTLY ON HOMELESSNESS AND HOPEFULLY ALSO KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS. AND WE NEED TO DO THE ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE NEED. TO BE ABLE TO TALLY UP HOW MUCH MORE THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN THIS AREA. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME AT ALL THAT THAT THAT THE STATEWIDE DATA WAREHOUSE WILL BE ABLE TO GET US THAT INFORMATION SO WONDERING. ON THOSE TWO QUESTIONS SORT OF ONE THE IMPACT ON THE INFORMATION ON STATE PROGRAMS AND TO. HOW CAN WE REALLY GET AT THAT NUMBER IF I'M IF I'M LOOKING FOR THE NUMBER OF HOW MUCH THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN HOMELESSNESS. IN THE COMING YEARS TO END HOMELESSNESS. IS THIS DATA GOING TO GET US THAT INFORMATION. YEAH GREAT GREAT QUESTION SO I CAN WHAT WILL. THAT IS THAT IS ONE AT THE END OF THE MONTH IT'S JUST WHAT WE'RE GOING. SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF WHAT EACH DAY I CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE- WE REALLY SEE IT AS- AN OPPORTUNITY. TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE INFORM OUR POLICY MAKING AND RESOURCES TO TERMINATION I'M GOING REALLY INTO THE FUTURE. SO THAT ONE WILL BE SORT OF SHOWING THE FIRST AND WE'RE CALLING A BETA LAUNCH AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WILL HAVE A HANDFUL OF DASHBOARDS REALLY DIVING INTO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THINKING ABOUT THAT CROFTERS FICTIONAL OVERLAP- IN BEING BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT STATE. SEEM AS A SIMPLE OUT THERE GOING TO BE A LOT THEY ARE JUST THE FIRST ONE BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN WE NOW WE CAN ANALYZE AND LOOKING TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS GROUND SO. WE'RE EXPECTING SORT OF ON GOING AFTER THIS BUNCH IS THAT THEY'LL BE QUARTERLY ACT ANYTHING OR REALLY ANY QUESTIONS. ANSWERED RESEARCH STANDPOINT JUST BECAUSE OF HOW HARD PASSED THE SYSTEM WILL BE- SO WHAT WE ARE TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT WITH. YOU ALL. HERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS WHEN WE DO WE DO A PREVIEW OF THE SYSTEM EVERYBODY. BUT WE'LL JUST SAY THAT WHAT WE SEE ONE THING IS JUST THE BEGINNING AND THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE YOU KNOW WE CAN. A LOT OF YEAH. I'M INTO YOUR QUITE THINKING MAYBE MENTIONING. YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING. TO THIS OF. IS LOOKING AT MATCHING. HOMELESSNESS DATA WITH OTHER LOCAL. YOU FOR TAKING UP. STATE LAW. I'M I WOULD BE FOR WE'VE BEEN. LASER FOCUSED DEFEATING DISPERSE PHASE THAT. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT INTERNET. STEP IN A REALLY ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY. THERE BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW OUR REAL GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS AND GET. IS PRETTY PRETTY SIGNIFICAN LET'S LOOK. ROW BUT I KNOW THAT. I'M BUT IT'S SORT OF OUR PRIMARY. STEP BE YEAH FIRST HE'S GOING. TO RIGHT NOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE- AND- SYSTEM IS REALLY. ADAM IT IS TRACKING. THAT THE NUMBER OF ACROSS THIS. I HAVE ACCESS. THROUGH THE- SERVICES. STATE IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT. AND SENSE OF. TO IT'S MUCH. ABOUT WHAT THE IN. SERVICES ARE BE. WE NEED I DON'T THINK. THE WALLS THINGS AS A AS A HOMES DATA GEEK WOULD LOVE FOR MY STAFF AND I TO BE INVITED TO THE BRIEFINGS THAT YOU DO AS YOU ROLL THIS OUT BECAUSE WHAT WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS WILL WANT TO REALIZE THAT DATA- AND THEN TO OUR COLLEAGUES WHAT I WILL SAY IS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. PART OF THE FRUSTRATION IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT BUT IS THE REALITY THAT WE ARE JUST MAKING A DENT IN A VERY LARGE PROBLEM- SO YOU KNOW FOR TALKING ABOUT- ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS WERE HOMELESS WHEN WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED. THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT'S A MATTER SCALE AND- I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF. REALLY WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE IF WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY AND HOMELESSNESS. SERVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT WE NEED- JUST SO WE CANHAVE. APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR CONSTITUENTS AND FOR OURSELVES OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO. AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT NUMBER IS QUITE LARGE BUT WE'VE NEVER REALLY TALLIED IT UP ACROSS THE STATE AND SO. I THINK AND HOPE THAT THIS YEAR WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH SOME SORT OF AT LEAST HIGH LEVEL GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS TO REALLY GET THAT I THINK THAT'LL- PROBABLY FRAME THE CONVERSATION WHAT WE NEED TO DO- AND LOOK FORWARD TO AT TEND TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS DURING THIS BUDGET. PROCESS AND WITH THAT MEASURE BUT DO YOU THANKS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER TO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH AND LET ME JUST SAY- MISS THAT INTO YOU INTO YOUR COLLEAGUES.

LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT- THIS IS RELATED TO TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION- COMMITTEE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS WILL BEGIN WITH MASS- NANCY ARE HOMELESS AND I WANNA WELCOME IS ROBUST TO OUR COMMITTEE SHE WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C. T. C. A. C. AND WE WANTED TO GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE HERSELF AND THEN. A FOLLOW UP WITH HER DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ANY ADDITIONAL- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AT BEFORE WE GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE ANALYST OFFICE MISS ROBLESS. GREAT THANK YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AND IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU ALL. I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE. AND I AM A RECOVERING BANKER I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY AND STARTED MY STATE CAREER AT CP CFA IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AFTER THAT I WENT TO A CASE THAT THE TRACTOR'S OFFICE FOR A WHILE AND THEN- WAS THE ACTING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF I THINK. I WAS AT I THINK FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS AND I'VE NOW COME BACK TO THE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND I AM AT. A PRETTY BRAND NEW EMPLOYEE TO THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. AND THAT IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU ALL. THANK YOU. THANKS MISTER SET UP. AND THEN WE'LL GO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON- I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND REAL QUICK ON THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. ARE WE ARE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT IN PLACE TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. AND THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND ONE OF WHICH IS A 4% TAX CREDIT WHICH- ARE REQUIRED TO BE CARED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS. IN THE ALLOCATING AGENCY FOR THAT IS SET LACK WHICH IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION TO MANY- THROUGH THAT YOU KNOW IN IN YEARS PAST THE BONDS WERE NOT COMPETITIVE- HOWEVER. IN TWENTY NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ON ONE AUTHORIZED. ATTY CAC TO OUR ALLOCATE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND STATE TAX CREDITS TO THESE PROJECTS ARE SPECIFIC 24% SPECIFIC TO NEW CONSTRUCTION- TO TEST FOR- UNIT PRODUCTION AND FULL UTILIZATION OF THE BOND CAP. AND IN IN REVIEWING IT IT LOOKS LIKE WE DID THAT- I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME DATA. OF HIS NAME. 4% PROJECTS NEW CONSTRUCTION UNITS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE DID ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED NEW CONSTRUCTION 4% UNITS- THAT WAS ABOUT SIXTY ONE PROJECTS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE DID ABOUT FORTY NINE HUNDRED. WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTY PROJECTS IN IN TWENTY TWENTY WE DID A TOTAL. THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT TOTAL UNITS. THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THREE PROJECTS. IN OF THOSE THIRTEEN UNITS I WOULD SAY FIVE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WERE SPECIFICALLY TIED TO ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT JUST BELOW SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS. SO IT ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED THE VOLUME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION UNITS ON THE 4% HELLO LET LOOKS LIKE A SUCCESS- BASED ON THAT STATISTIC- IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE CAME OUT AND IT REQUIRE T. K. I CAN SELECT TO ADOPT REGULATION CHANGES TO A LOT ALIGN THE COMMITTEES WITH THE GOAL TO INCREASE PRODUCTION. AND CONTAIN COSTS AND ADOPT THE SCORING SYSTEM THAT MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY. AND THREW I WANT TO SAY TEN MEETINGS BUT AT LEAST TEN PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. REGULATION CHANGES WERE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEY INCORPORATED A LOT OF THE GOALS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE SPECIFIC TO- PROXIMITY TO AMENITIES AND JOBS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION LOCATIONS OF DEVELOPMENT. DELIVERY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOW EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING- AND INCENTIVES TO PRESERVE PROVIDE PROVIDE A DENSITY INCREASES. AND THEN JUST EFFICIENT USE OF THE- RESOURCE CENTER AND ALL OF THAT WAS BUILT INTO THE REGULATIONS- SO WE DID BUT STATE IN FEBRUARY WE RECEIVED. A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TO COMPLICATIONS ON A 4% SIDE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL PROBABLY GONNA BE ABOUT TWO TO TWO AND A HALF. TIMES OVERSUBSCRIBED BASED ON YOU KNOW BASED ON. THE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST ROUND SO- THE REGULAR CHECK CHANGES ULTIMATELY. ARE WHAT THE GOAL IS TO SPREAD THE BONDS OUT. HOUSE PROGRAMS IN THE VARIOUS REGIONS AND AGAIN SPRIGGAN PRODUCTION AND- LOWER THE COSTS. SO IF I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU MISTER SETTLER TO WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND DINNER CRUISE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. LMAO RIGHT ONE BILLION IN AND DOLLARS AND LOW INCOME HAPPENED CREDIT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE LEGISLATURE CONTEMPLATES PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WE JUST ADJUST THE LEGISLATURE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT A COPY BY FUNDS- HAVE OR BEEN AUTHORIZED I'M NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF UNITS BUT ALSO EXAMPLE- HOW THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED WHERE THOSE UNITS ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHERE HAVE BEEN THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BEFORE WE DO THAT I HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN. WHAT IS A GEOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF TAX CREDITS AND BONDS IN THE LAST ROUND- THE LAST ROUND. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF REGIONS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE SAID LACK OF REGULATIONS ON DECEMBER- AND THESE ARE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WITHIN. A NEW CONSTRUCTION. SET ASIDE- NOW GRANTED THESE WERE ESTABLISHED- REGULATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED FOR OUR FUTURE SO THE INFORMATION I'M PROVIDING TO YOU WAS PRIOR TO THESE REGULATIONS BEING ADOPTED- BUT I CAN GIVE YOU BASED ON THOSE REGIONS. I'D SAY APPROXIMATELY. THE L. A. COUNTY. ABOUT SIX AND I'M LOOKING AT BONDS AND TAX CREDITS SEPARATELY BUT ROUGHLY VERY CLOSE UP PERCENTAGES LICENSE- COASTAL GENERALS ABOUT WAS ABOUT 46% THE INLAND REGION WITH ABOUT 3% AND THEN THE NORTHERN REGION WAS ABOUT SIX AND A HALF PERCENT. BUT AGAIN THE WORK BASED OFF OF- FIGURES THAT PRECEDED THE REGULATION ADOPTION SO NOW WE WON'T KNOW. THE RESULTS OF THE REGULATIONS- UNTIL A LITTLE BIT FURTHER- PROBABLY IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. THANK YOU AND CAN YOU ALSO PROVIDE US A BREAK DOWN OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT RECEIVED AWARDS IN THE LAST ROUND. INCOME LEVELS OF THE UNITS AND THE LOCATION OF THE DEVELOPMENTS. YEAH THE LOCATIONS- INCLUDED ABOUT SIXTEEN COUNTY. OUR RANGING FROM ALAMEDA TO BE YOU WHEN CONTRA COSTA I DON'T KNOW HOW SPECIFIC- I HAVE KIND OF CONSOLIDATED DATA- THE INCOME LEVELS RANGE FROM 20% ALL THE WAY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. I THINK MOST OF THE TWENTY AND 30% UNITS- RESIDED IN LA- BAY AREA. AND WE AT ABOUT NINE OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING OUT OF THE FORTY EIGHT PROJECTS THAT HAD UNITS RESTRICTED ALL THE WAY UP 280% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME- BUT I'D SAY HALF OF THEM. WERE SPECIFICALLY- THEY WOULD QUALIFY UNDER WHAT WE HAVE CHARACTERIZED AS ELI FEEL LIKE- SET ASIDE AND- SO TWENTY FOUR OF THE FORTY EIGHT WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED UNDER THAT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO EMAIL THAT INFORMATION TO BUDGET STUFF. YES ABSOLUTELY GREAT THANK YOU IN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTING- OF MR TO DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT REQUIREMENTS. I DO THANK YOU- MISTER ZERO UP THANK YOU FOR DISCUSSING THE GEOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF TAX CREDITS UP I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- THE SAID LAG. UPSET LACK ALLOCATION SCORING SYSTEM WITH REGARDS TO THE BAY AREA- I SUSPECT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS BUT YOU KNOW OF THE TWENTY PROJECTS IN THE BAY THAT COMPETED FOR. BONDS IN ROUND ONE ONLY THREE RECEIVED AN AWARD NONE OF THE MAJOR CITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO CENTERS THERE OAKLAND THAT'S 11% OF BEAR PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED WHICH IS ONE OF THE LOWEST RATES COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS. AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD- THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES THAT- OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE AROUND THE CIRCLE TIEBREAKER- THAT- FOCUSES ON COST EFFICIENCY AND DOESN'T REFLECT THE FACT THAT IN HIGH COST CITIES IN THE BAY AREA. IN REGIONS LIKE THE BAY AREA WHERE- WHERE- YOU CAN ACTUALLY FUND PRODUCTION ANDIN CITIES WHERE THEY ARE NEAR JOBS AND TRANSIT HUBS- WE THINK THAT- THERE ARE PROJECTS ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT DISCUSSION AND- WHAT WE CAN DO TO WORK ON THAT MOVING FORWARD. YEAH I MEAN- I THINK YOU KNOW I MENTIONED THAT WE WENT THROUGH TEN PUBLIC. MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE REGULATIONS INCLUDING THE TIEBREAKER- A LOT OF THE FOCUS WAS AGAIN YOU KNOW TO CONFORM WITH WHAT EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE REQUIRED WHICH WAS COST CONTAINMENT WAS A HUGE THING- AND ANOTHER THING WAS. SPREADING THE RESOURCES AND WHEN YOU MENTION THE TIE BREAKER. WHAT TYPE RECOGNITION INCLUDES A FACTOR THAT- YOU KNOW LOWER REQUEST- ARE AT A HIGHER VANTAGE. IN ADDITION UNIT PRODUCTION IS ALSO IN THERE AND I THINK WE ARE. THE POLICY OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSION WITH THE REGULATIONS WHAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND- OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS UNTIL YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS ARE SUBMITTED AND- SO RIGHT NOW THE ROUND THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING. OBVIOUSLY THE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED. AND THEY'RE STILL REVIEW. SO WE WON'T KNOW THE FINAL RESULT- UNTIL THEY DO WARDS REMAIN. WE ARE AWARE OF THAT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT IT- WE ARE ALSO REVIEWING THE BASIS LIMITS- THAT'S ALSO BEING INCLUDED IN THE TIE BREAKER- BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO BE EQUITABLE TO ALL PARTIES AND- WE ALSO HAD WORKING GROUP'S WHICH INCLUDED. WORLD IN URBAN AREAS- BOTH- NONPROFITS AND FOR PROFITS. IN THE WORD- PART OF THE PROCESS AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE PROCESS THAT I DURING THIS WHOLE REGULATION CHANGE- YEAH THE ENTIRE PROCESS WE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT. AND I THINK WE WERE BY TAKING THESE TO PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE OUTCOMES- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT GO BACK AND LOOK AT. RE REVIEW THE REGULATIONS AND- SEE IF THEY- PUT OUT WHAT WE- THE POLICIES THAT WE ENVISIONED. WHEN THEY WERE PUT IN PLACE. SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT ELSE AND RESPONSE I AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW I AM. THE ONE LEGISLATOR IN THE LEAD THE ONE LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE OF THE PAST SIX YEARS THAT HAS-REALLY CHAMPIONED- THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN THE PORTLAND TAX CREDIT- I INTRODUCED. A BILL TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR FIRST. BOB IGER RESEARCH AND- AND SO I APPRECIATE AYE I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE AT- BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN THE BAY ANTICIPATED- THAT THIS WOULD MEAN VERY LITTLE FUNDING COMING TO OUR REGION WHICH HAS BEEN GROUND ZERO FOR. THE HOUSING CRISIS AND SO- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE REGULATORY PROCESS I HEARD A LOT OF CRITICISMS OF THAT REGULATORY PROCESS I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. I THINK- I'M I'M HEARING YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT ON THIS- THERE'S A TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION. AMONG THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY AND IN THE BAY AREA AROUND THIS AND- I HOPE TO NOT HAVE TO INTRODUCE BILL TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION. IN A MORE SERIOUS HUESO I'D REALLY HOPE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- WE CAN GET TO A BETTER SPOT ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK AT THIS POINT- THE BAY AREA WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE- WE'RE PENALIZED- FOR THE FACT THAT. WE ARE SUCH A HIGH COST REASON AND BECAUSE WE'RE HIGH COST REGION WE'RE TRYING TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE OF RESOURCES FROM THE STATE ON THAT SO I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT- SHIFTING TO A SECOND TOPIC- AND THIS. GETS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE COLLEAGUES OUR DISCUSSION FOR AROUND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE KNOW THAT HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT REQUIRE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH. ILLNESSES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND STAFF. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE KINDS OF PROJECTS YOU'RE AWARDING DON'T REALLY ALIGN WITH THE MORE EXPENSIVE- PROJECTS THAT THAT REQUIRE- THAT THE TYPES OF. OF CARE AND SERVICES FOR- THESE CHRONICALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE COST FACTOR THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER I. WOULD LIKE YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT- SOMETHING I THINK WE ALSO MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER- WELL I WOULD. THE YOU KNOW WE DO WHO ARE A PART OF THE REGULATION. THAT ONE OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WAS ADOPTED WAS ESTABLISHING. RULES AND SET ASIDES AND- OF THOSE POLLS THAT INCLUDED. HOMELESS PROJECTS AND- HE ALIVE BE ALIVE PROJECTS. I THINK PROJECTS THAT FIT. SOME OF THE DESCRIPTION YOU HAD STATED. IN I THINK. AND I DON'T HAVE THE PROJECTS BUT BEFORE ME RIGHT NOW BUT- OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE GOAL OF THOSE. SET ASIDES WERE TO TACKLE THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS- LOWER LOWER INCOME. AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHICH- AND ARE YOU STATING THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON. YOUR. ARE YOU STAYING SPECIFICALLY THE BAY AREA. WELL I CAN. TO THIS IS A BROAD STATEWIDE CONVERSATION EVEN WITHIN THOSE PROJECTS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DEAL I PROJECTS. OR OR OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOUSING THAT ADDRESS FOLKS WITH CHRONIC HOMELESS UP CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THAT HOUSING IS MORE EXPENSIVE UNDER YOUR CURRENT REGULATORY FORMULAS YOU PRIORITIZE THE PER UNIT COST SO IT DOESN'T FACTOR IN A KNIFE TO ALLOW FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO WIN- TOOK TO WIN IN YOUR PROCESS SO AGAIN RAISING THE IMPACT OF THE COST EFFICIENCY I GET. WE ALL WANT TO SEE COST EFFICIENCIES BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE ARE POLICY REASONS WHY THE PER UNIT COST IF WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF A- OF A PERSON WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH. ILLNESSES IT'LL JUST BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO AGAIN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BALANCING THOSE POLICY IMPERATIVES. YEAH AN AND WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND SEEING WHAT THE POLICY OUTCOMES ARE- YOU KNOW WE WILL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AND- WELL WE WILL ADDRESS IT AS SOON AND- WHEN WE DO THIS COULD I COULD I GET AN UPDATE AND MAYBE IN IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS COULD YOUR OFFICE. GIVE US AN UPDATE ON. MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS- ON HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE MORE CHRONICALLY- THE SET THESE CHRONIC. BECAUSE UP OKAY- WORD AND DISCUSSIONS WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND I REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE CYCLE WE'RE GOING TO APPROVE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED BILLION WE HAVE SOME GOOD ANSWERS ON THIS. OKAY AND ONE FINAL QUESTION HAS THERE BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT GIVING TO CAC THE AUTHORITY TO DEPLOY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND STATE CREDITS WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR IN EITHER THE PROGRAMS IN YEARS WHEN TAX EXEMPT BONDS ARE COMPETITIVE- I THINK I'VE I'VE HEARD. I'VE HEARD DISCUSSION ON THAT AND I THINK- THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT WAS THAT. D. IN THE CREDITS IF THE CREDITS IF THERE'S ENOUGH PROJECTS TO FULLY UTILIZE THE FEDERAL CREDIT ON THE 4% SITE- AND THE BONDS- BECAUSE THAT WAS THE WHOLE ISSUE RIGHT. OF THE- BOBCAT WAS NOT BEING USED- ASSUMING THAT I THINK- PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO THE HOUSING AGENCY COULD BE COULD BE A- HOPSIN- HOWEVER YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE IS A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF STATE CREDITS MADE AVAILABLE 29% PROJECTS AND- IT WOULD ESTABLISH PROBABLY BIGGER POTS I GUESS. FOR THE 9% PROJECTS IF THOSE WERE MADE AVAILABLE BUT I WOULD HAVE. TO PROBABLY BE DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. WHICH. AND FOR COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW STATE LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF 4% STATE TAX CREDITS- WITH 9% CREDITS- AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT GIVING TO CAP THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW THE STATE TAX RATE IS TO BE PAIRED. WITH THESE CREDIT SO- AGAIN WHY DON'T LET'S YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT WHAT I THINK WHAT I'D SUGGEST IS IF MY OFFICE IF WE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. AND YOUR OFFICE ON ON THESE THREE ISSUES IN THE COMING WEEKS- BEFORE- WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME FINAL BUDGET VOTES ON THIS- I'D APPRECIATE THAT. YES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. THANKS MANAGER THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT TWO I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD- MISTER CO I THINK- THE COMMON SIDE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN FRANCISCO RELATED TO THE BAY AREA IS A REALLY A SHARED SENTIMENT IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION THAT'S RELATABLE TO THE DISTRICTS THAT WE REPRESENT. SO IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE DATA AS THEY REQUESTED TO OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE HEARING FOR TODAY THAT'S- MORE RELATABLE IN TERMS OF REGIONS AND SPECIFICALLY ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WHERE THE WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US TO DETERMINE WHERE- MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED AS WELL AS- A RESOURCES- THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR- ACROSS THE STATE AND FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY SO. IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO WE WOULD ALSO JUST BE REALLY APPRECIATIVE AND BE ABLE TO SEE THE DATA AND IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED SENT TO LOOK GREAT THANK YOU NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE WE CAN MOVE ON AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING A PART OF THAT AND AGAIN MISS ROBLESS- WELCOME TO US OF FOR.
