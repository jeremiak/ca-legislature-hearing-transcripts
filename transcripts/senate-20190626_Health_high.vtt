00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.676
TOUGHNESS ESPECIALLY DURING WHAT

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.211
WE CALLED HELL WEEK.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:07.780
AND I REMEMBER SOME OF MY

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.181

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.917
TOUGH SHOTS.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.587
AND I REMEMBER A PARTICULAR CASE

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:15.421
WHERE.

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:17.990
A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE --

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.330
BLURRED VISION HAD A FEVER.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:26.565
OF COURSE NOBODY RECOGNIZE CITY

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:27.933

TECHNOLOGY WITH HELMET --

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.812
CONSTRUCTION TODAY IS.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.582
MORE ADVANCED AND DO WE HAVE A

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.450
STILL A LONG WAYS TO GO TO A

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.852
REALLY BUT FOR THE BRAIN IF YOU

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.020

UP ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.992
JUST YOU KNOW KINETICS IS

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.995
CONNECTICUT'S RIGHT SO -- WHAT

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:30.529
ELSE COULD WE BE DOING TO

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.563
PROTECT OUR KIDS?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.931
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER --

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:33.832
SO COUPLE THINGS -- WHEN I START

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.334
WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAN AS A

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.771
CHILD I WERE SUSPENSION ON IT?

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:39.805
TWO STRAPS.

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:45.678
WITH PLASTIC OVER TOP OF IT --

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.146
NOT RELEASED TESTED CERTIFIED

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.847
STANDARDS WERE ARE THE WILD WILD

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.949
WEST -- NOWADAYS THERE'S BEEN

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.851
INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:53.719
TECHNOLOGY OF THE HELMET --

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.521
VIRGINIA TECH HAS A FIVE STAR

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:56.722
RATING PROCESS THAT THEY RUN

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.090
INDEPENDENT.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.091
AND IN THEIR LABS AND THAT

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.559
THAT'S REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.861
FOR WHAT HOW MUCH SHOULD BE

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:03.862
PURCHASED OR NOT PURCHASED IT

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.230
CETERA -- THEY PUBLISH AT EVERY

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.532
YEAR THIS YEAR THEY ANNOUNCED

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:07.966
FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY THEY

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.569
ACTUALLY RAN A A CERTIFICATION

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.538

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:14.406
FIRST TIME THEY'D EVER DONE THAT

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.307
UP UNTIL THEN THEY THEY WERE

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.843
DOING IT AT THE VARSITY YEAR

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.946
THAT PROFESSIONAL LEVEL -- SO

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.047
THERE ARE A LOT TO CHOICES VERY

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:26.552
AFFORDABLE CHOICES -- FOR FOR

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.253
FOR FAMILIES -- TO THE BALLOT

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.892
TECHNOLOGIES IT'S QUITE ADVANCED --

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.627
BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMENTED THE

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:36.995
HELMET IS THE IS THE LAST POINT

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.365
A DEFENSE.

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:40.599
IT'S IT'S REALLY IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.134
THE GOAL HERE IS TO EDUCATE

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.737
COACHES AND PARENTS EMPLOYERS.

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.004
ON HOW TO PLAY TACKLE FOOTBALL

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:47.706
SAFELY.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.907
AND REMOVE THE HEAD FROM PLAYING

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:50.242
AND YOU DO THAT BY TEACHING

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.577
TECHNIQUES.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.979
BLOCKING DEFEATING THE BLOCK

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:56.115
TACKLING TECHNIQUES THAT

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.549
MINIMIZE THE HEAD IMPLY.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.584
RIGHT TO THE HELMETS TO HELMETS

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.688
GOTTEN A LOT BETTER AND IT'S NOT

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:03.756
WE'RE NOT COACHING OR TEACHING

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:05.290
THINGS LIKE DON'T WORRY YOU CAN

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.892
RUN HARDER IN THE END INTO

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.459
THINGS BECAUSE OF A BETTER

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:07.693
HELMET.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.128
THE HELMET IS A LAYER OF

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:11.063
PROTECTION AND RELEASE IN

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.065
EDUCATION AWARENESS A CULTURAL

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.801
SHIFT THEY WERE DRIVING --

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.070
ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- THIS IS

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:18.837
REALLY GOING TO IT'S A

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.806
COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO PLUS

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.274
FOR STATE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.342
REALLY GOING TO ARE GOING.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.677
TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:27.846
FUTURE GENERATIONS OF THE ALSO --

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.916
ADDRESSING THE THE FACE CARDS --

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.217
WHAT WHEN I WAS PLAYING I WAS A

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:33.752
SPLIT AND SO I HAD JUST

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.554
BASICALLY A VERY SMALL FACE CARD

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:35.754
AND?

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.089
I ACTUALLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:40.192
INJURY WERE -- I WAS A DEFENSIVE

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:40.893
AND IT HAD MADE A TACKLE AND

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.394
ENDED UP CRASHING THE RIGHT SIDE

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.196
OF THE CARTILAGE OF MY NOSE TO

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:45.664
POINT WHERE WAS FLAT AND I

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.499
ACTUALLY HAD TO GO IN.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:51.136
FOR SURGERY TO HAVE IT FIXED NOW

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:51.870
THAT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.138
SERIOUS IF I WOULD TAKE A MORE

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:56.275
FRONTAL -- HIT AND IT WOULD HAVE.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:01.447
LODGED INTO THE THE BRAIN OR OR

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.982
THE A MORE SERIOUS INJURY ALL

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.984
TOGETHER WITH THE BONE BUT I'M

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.119
HOPING THAT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.587
INTO CONSIDERATION THE THE THE

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:09.655
FACIAL EXPOSURE.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.624
AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.192
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:16.795
THEIR THEIR FACIAL INTEGRITY AND

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.397
SENSITIVITY OF THOSE AREAS AS

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:21.166
WELL YES SO -- FACE MASKS ARE

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:28.307

ON HELMETS -- AND THE OTHER

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.549
THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:40.152

HIGHER LEVEL OF PSYCHIATRIC

THERE IS A CONCERN.

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.999
THAT SOME PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.867

OPERATE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.109
AS A WAY TO NOT ACCEPT ALL

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.577
PATIENTS.

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:33.845

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.199
THE LACK OF PROVIDERS WHO USED

WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LOT OF

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.710
DIFFERENT REASONS A BIG REASON

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:20.778
IS THAT I'M A MILLENNIAL.

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.180
IT WAS MY FAMILY THAT -- MY

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.148
PARENTS WENT THROUGH THIS

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.217
RECESSION IN A WAY THAT IMPACTED

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.051
IT'S GONNA HAVE A LONG TERM

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:29.453
IMPACT ON ME AND MY FROM MY

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.322
GENERATION I THINK ON ALL THIS

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:31.989
BUT SPECIFICALLY ON MY

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:32.857
GENERATION.

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.825
AND THAT IMPACT IS GOING TO BE

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:36.761
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MY MOM MY

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:38.396
STEP DAD WAS STARTING A BUSINESS

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:40.798
RIGHT WHEN THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN.

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.799
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WAS

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:42.767
GOING TO BE THEY PUT ALL OF

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:43.968
THEIR RETIREMENT ALL OF THEIR

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.170
SAVINGS ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:46.904
PENNY AND TO KEEP IN THE

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:47.805
BUSINESS ALIVE.

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.340
THEY COULDN'T DO A LONG ENOUGH

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:50.541
TO NOT ONLY DID THEY LOSE ALL

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:51.909
THEIR RETIREMENT ALL THAT

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.010
RETIREMENT SECURITY THEY ALSO

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.245
LOST THEIR HOME.

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:55.980
SO YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING WERE TO

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.815
HAPPEN YEAH MY STEP DAD HE'S

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.883

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.412
DEVASTATING FINANCIALLY SO THE

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.848

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:20.431
THE MAJORITY OF MY MEMBERS ARE

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.466

MANY PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THIS

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:08.012

AND WHEN WE STARTED REACHING OUT

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.343
TO THOSE FOLKS LAST YEAR TO

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.111
LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:28.312

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.713
IN THE PAPER ALL SPACE THE

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.981
PAPERWORK BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.549
THAT WORK QUICKLY ROSE TO THE

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:34.084
TOP OF THEIR LIST OF CONCERNS

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.486
THEY INDICATED THEY THOUGHT IT

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.354
TOOK ABOUT 4250% FOR OTHER

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.789

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.158
THIS CARE.

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.626
BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.228
REASONS THAT THEY LOSE

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:45.896
PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.298
ADD TO THIS WORK TO OTHER

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.867
RESOURCES -- AND A LOT OF THAT

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:50.734
IS JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.336
VARIATION AMONGST THE DIFFERENT

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.038
COUNTY SO YOU HAVE FIFTY SIX

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.039
DIFFERENT SETS OF COUNTY

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.206
PAPERWORK.

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.608
MOST OF OUR HOSPITALS WORK WITH

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:58.842
MORE THAN ONE COUNTY NOT

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.044
PAPERWORK EVEN FOR THE INTAKE

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.812

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.948
SEVEN PAGES UP INTO TWENTY

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:05.482
TWENTY FIVE PAGES -- AND OFTEN

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:07.384
IT'S NOT ELECTRONICS SO THEY

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:08.886
HAVE TO FILL IT OUT BY HAND --

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.220
AND BASICALLY THEY SAID IF WE

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:11.255
COULD JUST FIX THE PAPERWORK

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:13.457
PROBLEM WE COULD SEE 30% MORE

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:17.995
KIDS AND THAT KIND OF BLEW MY

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.296
MIND -- AND AT THAT POINT WE

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:19.863
SAID LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.564
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND WE WERE

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:21.632
GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:23.767

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:24.868
ALSO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT NOT

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.236
ONLY IS IT ABOUT THE BURDEN OF

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.404
THE PAPER WORK BUT WE HAVE

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:27.805

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.006

FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY AND IT

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.578
IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.713
THAT MIGHT CREATE.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.414
INAPPROPRIATE BARRIERS TO CARE

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:38.315
THAT CHILDREN ARE OTHERWISE

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.883

THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.097
THAT FAILURE TO PROVIDE

IN STARTING HEARING AIDS

LANGUAGE POTENTIAL. FOR THIS

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:10.747
REASON HEARING LOSS IS

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.282
CONSIDERED A DEVELOPMENTAL

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:14.284

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:32.302
THE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS.

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.037
HEARING AIDS COST UP TO THREE

TIMELY MANNER WHEN THEY HIT THEM --

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:48.552
THESE PREVENTABLE CONSEQUENCES

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:49.953
ARE NOT ONLY DEVASTATING FOR THE

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.021

OCCASIONAL COSTS AND LOST

TO NARROW THE BILL AND OUR

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.610
HEARTS GO OUT CERTAINLY TO THE

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:35.811
FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING IN

TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.486
I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN IS

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.654
THERE WAS THAT.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.956
THERE WAS A PROCESS THE STATE IS --

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.892
CHOSEN A BENCHMARK PLAN TWICE.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.261
OUR OUR PRIMARY INTEREST WOULD

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:55.364
BE TO HAVE THAT PROCESS PLAY OUT

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.465
I KNOW THE ANALYSIS DID A

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.800
WONDERFUL JOB OF KIND OF

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:58.868
HIGHLIGHTING THAT THERE IS AN

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.369
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE MOVING

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.905
FORWARD TO CHOOSE TO ELECT TO RE

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.507
EVALUATE THE BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.142
THERE WERE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.043
THAT INCLUDED COVERAGE FOR

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.811
HEARING AIDS WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.746
THAT THAT HAVING THAT FRAMEWORK

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.915
PUT IN PLACE AND UTILIZING THAT

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.985
OPTION AS A WAY TO LOOK AT THIS

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.987
BENEFIT AS WELL AS OTHERS -- AND

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.622
TO CONSIDER THAT OPTION AND

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.123
GOING FORWARD I KNOW THE ENOUGH

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.858
TO SIT POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.760
UNTIL MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.362
NOTIFY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:28.431
ELECT -- FOR AND CONSIDER NEW

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.566
BENCHMARK PLAN WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.434
TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.668
CONCERNED THAT THE BILL IS

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.671
LIMITED. TO CHILDREN.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:36.772
WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:37.573
ANNOUNCES THAT TO BURKE DID

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.342
BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR CONCERN

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:40.142
WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.944
CONSIDERED DISCRIMINATORY AND WE

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.112
WOULD HAVE TO COVER.

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:44.914
HEARING AIDS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.816
REGARDLESS OF AGE WHICH WOULD

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.951
MEAN THAT THAT SUBURBAN ALICE'S

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.419
AND THE NUMBERS THAT DENOTED TO

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:51.988
THE PREMIUM IMPACTS WOULD NOT

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.023
ACTUALLY BEAR OUT THE COST WOULD

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.691
BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IF WE HAD TO

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.294
COVER THEM FOR ALL AGE RANGES.

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:00.263
SO WITH THOSE CONCERNS -- WE

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.564
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.465

OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN GOING

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:12.642

ITS WONDERFULLY COMPREHENSIVE

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.188
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE YET AGAIN OF

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:35.057
WHERE IT PROVIDES COVERAGE --

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:35.624
FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.625
CALIFORNIANS WERE PRIVATE

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.361

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.322
TO A POPULATION AND NOT THE

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.491
ENTIRE POPULATION AND SO IF

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:09.859
SOMEONE COULD JUST PROVIDE ME

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:11.127
SOME CLARITY ON ON THE

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.362
DISCRIMINATORY CLAIM IF THAT'S

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:15.398
TRULY VALID.

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:18.734
SO -- LET ME IF I'M GONNA LET ME

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:19.635
TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FOR

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.369
SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I HAVE

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.671
ONE MORE THAN I'M DONE THANK YOU --

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.173
SO.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.709
SO THE NATURE IS SO THAT THERE

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.711
ISN'T A LAW -- SO BASICALLY WHAT

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.446
HAPPENS IS THAT -- THERE CAN BE

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:31.881
A CLAIM THAT IT MIGHT BE

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:32.915
DISCRIMINATORY BECAUSE WE'RE

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.851
ONLY DOING CHILDREN SO BECAUSE

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:36.652
UNDER.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.455
BUT WE HAVE TO TREAT ALL BEEN

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.623
FISHERIES.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:43.159
THE SAME AND SO SOMEONE IS OLDER

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.226
COULD SAY WELL I'M NOT CHILD BUT

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:45.261
CONSIDERING CURRENT MY POINT IS

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.996
WE DID THAT AND MEDICARE WE

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:47.730
PROVIDE RIGHT.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.765
RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH EXACTLY SO

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.367
THAT'S MEDI CAL BUT WE'RE NOW

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.701
TALKING ABOUT -- DOWN THE

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.737
PRIVATE INSURANCE THERE IS A

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:55.304
DIFFERENT.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.972
THERE'S A PUT THERE YES THERE IS

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.441
A POSSIBILITY THERE'S A PAUSE

01:07:58.507 --> 01:07:59.375
IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY THE

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.310
POSSIBILITY AND SO THE CONCERN

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:02.645
IS IS THAT WE HAD SOME SEVERAL

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.146
DISCUSSIONS I APPRECIATE WORKING

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:07.616
WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.419
IS IS THAT -- TO STILL SAY THAT

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:11.687
OUR GOAL IS CHILDREN BUT

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:12.755
RECOGNIZING THERE IS A

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.423
POSSIBILITY NAY RECOGNIZE THE

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.825
OPPOSITION HAS CONCERNS BECAUSE

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.893
IF IT'S RULE DISCRIMINATORY BY

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.796
THE WITH.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:21.997
IT BY THE REGULATORS AT IT THEN

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:22.998
ESSENTIALLY IT WOULD

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:24.500
AUTOMATICALLY THEN EXTEND TO

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.001
EVERYONE AND THAT WOULD GREATLY

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.703
INCREASE THE COST SO LITTLE AND

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.871
THEN WE'D HAVE TO COME BACK HERE

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.172
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.374
THAT SO -- SO THAT THERE IS A

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.909
RISK OF THAT I THINK ONE OF THE

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.044
THINGS WE WORKED ON IS ACTUALLY

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.413
PUTTING STRONGER INTENT LANGUAGE

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.848
TO MAKE CLEAR IT'S NOT CERTAIN

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:39.748
THAT THEY WILL REGULATE THEY

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:40.783
WILL RULE THAT WAY EITHER WITH

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.251
OUR SEVERAL STATES THAT HAVE

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:43.552
CHILDREN ONLY.

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.354
SO IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY BUT IT'S

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.122
A POSSIBILITY GOT IT THANK YOU

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.590
FOR THAT OKAY FAKING.

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.191
AND MY SECOND FINAL QUESTION

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.860
HERE AT ONE ONE COMMENT ON THAT

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.863
ISSUE -- IF YOU PLEASE SENATOR

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.297
THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:56.866
AND HUMAN SERVICES IS ALREADY

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.001
ISSUED A RULE THAT CLARIFIES

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.936
THAT STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.404
WITH H. DISTINCTIONS.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.973
DO NOT CONSTITUTE AGE

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:08.777
DISCRIMINATION.

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:11.347
AND TO A I CAN I CAN QUOTE FROM --

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.649
FROM THAT FINAL RULE -- BUT IT'S

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:17.186
IT IT SIR IT'S QUITE CLEAR WELL

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:19.021
I THINK THE THING AND ADDED

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:19.989
WITHOUT GOING TO ATTRACT

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:20.589
APPRECIATE YOU BRING THAT UP.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:21.857
I THINK THE WAY THE RULES OF THE

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:22.558
LOSS SAID IS ACTUALLY A

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.260
DISCUSSION OF OUR STATE

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.661
REGULATORS TODAY IT'S THEIR

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.962
THEIR TO WANT TO MAKE THE CALL

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.531
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OR

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:29.999
OTHER SIMILAR ISSUES AND THAT'S

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:30.866
THE CHALLENGE.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:37.940
THANK YOU MY FINAL QUESTION IS --

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:38.707
SOMEONE MENTION COCHLEAR

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.209
IMPLANTS IS IT JUST HEARING AIDS

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:40.876
THAT AREN'T COVERED.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:43.112
OUR OTHER A HEARING -- KIND OF

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.280
REMEDIATION CYCLE CLEAR IMPACTS

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.347
COVER IN THIS JUST HEARING AIDS

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.716
ARE NOT THE IRONY HERE IS THAT

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.818
COCHLEAR IMPLANTS ARE.

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.554
INCLUDED AS I CENTRAL HEALTH

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.923
BENEFIT -- I SHOULD POINT OUT

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:56.859
THAT -- FOR MANY CHILDREN I

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:58.093
THINK -- DOCTOR CHECK AND

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.361
PROBABLY BETTER SPEAK TO THIS

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.563
BUT MANY CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:03.098
COCHLEAR IMPLANTS START OUT WITH

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.466
HEARING AIDS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:07.870
ESSENTIAL TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:08.837
THANK YOU.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:09.872

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.312
TIME OKAY ASSN LEYVA.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.012
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:17.780
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM I WANNA

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:19.882
FORWARD I I THINK THAT WE CAN

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.050
ALWAYS FIND A WAY NOT TO DO

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:21.917
SOMETHING.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.285
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.254
WE DO FIND A WAY TO DO SOMETHING

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:26.789
AND HEARING AIDS -- ARE

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.257
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.726
FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN I WAS

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.261
GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE A VERY

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.763
LONG TIME AGO -- AND MY DEGREE

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.632
IS IN A COMMUNICATIVE DISORDERS

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:37.499
I WAS GOING TO BE A SPEECH

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:38.500
THERAPIST AND I WAS TAKING A

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.070
CLASS AN AUDIOLOGY I WAS ALSO

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:41.670
SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH OUR

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.605
TWINS.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:44.940
AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.542
WHEN MY GIRLS ARE BORN BUT IN

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.077
OTHER GIRLS AT THE TIME WHEN MY

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:49.178
CHILDREN ARE BORN?

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.447
IF THEY NEED A HEARING AID I

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.349
NEED TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.818
CHILDREN FALL BEHIND SO QUICKLY

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:58.320
IF THEY CAN'T HEAR AND AND AND

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:02.091
LEARN SOUNDS AND WORDS.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:02.725
SO.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.059
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:05.794
ARE PROVIDING IT FOR CHILDREN

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:08.163
UNDER EIGHT ARE UNDER.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:08.931
EIGHTEEN BUT I ALSO WANT TO PUT

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.634
A PLUG IN FOR ADULTS BECAUSE AS

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.168
SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED WORKERS

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:14.670
FOR MANY YEARS.

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:17.906
I HAD A MY CREW GUY -- OF THIRTY

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.241
FIVE YEARS IT WAS ABOUT TO LOSE

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.209
HIS JOB.

01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:21.977
AND I ASKED HIM I SAID YOU KNOW

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.512
YOU'RE SO ANGRY ALL THE TIME

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:24.947
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HE COULDN'T

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.882
HEAR SO MANAGEMENT THOUGHT THAT

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.151
HE WAS IGNORING THEM HE COULDN'T

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.819
HEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS.

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:32.087
AND IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT YOU

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.323
WERE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.190
NINETEEN AND WE'RE STILL ARGUING

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.325
OVER WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:37.960
HEARING AIDS TO MAKE SURE OUR

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.895
CHILDREN CAN LEARN. TO MAKE SURE

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.197
ADULTS CAN DO THEIR JOB AND BE

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.433
EFFECTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY SO

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.001
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS FIND A

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:49.938
WAY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND THREE

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:52.775
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HEARING AID.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.809
SIX THOUSAND FOR ONE CHILD AND

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.077
THEY'RE GONNA OUTGROW THOSE

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.378
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY I DON'T

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.713
KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE TO

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.947
MAKE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.449
SO WE NEED TO GET TO A POINT

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:01.984
WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.652
PAYING FOR IT I KNOW YOU HATE TO

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:06.021
HEAR THAT BUT WHAT WE DO DO WE

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.656
JUST ALLOW THESE YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.425
TO NOT BUILD HERE AND DEVELOP

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.260
AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL --

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.594
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY WE CAN

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:14.263
FIND A WAY TO SAY NO LET'S FIND

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:18.000
A WAY TO SAY YES I AM LOOK FOR

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.468
SUPPORTING THE BILL.

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.636

APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS ON

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:23.772
IT AND I DO AGREE WITH MY

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.174
COLLEAGUES THAT WE DO NEED TO

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.375
MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING GETS

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.078
DONE FOR CHILDREN -- AND ADULTS

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.112
BUT TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.180
CHILDREN BUT I DO HAVE SOME

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:34.083
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS AND

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.584
I'M SORRY THAT I DON'T HAVE THE

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.552
ANSWER SO BE LOOKING TO ALL OF

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.686
YOU TO GIVE THEM.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.054
SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.856
PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE THE A BOMB

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:43.192
ADMINISTRATION WITH THE ACA --

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:45.828
WAS HEARING AIDS OR HEARING

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.229
PROTECT HEARING.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:50.699
AIDS WERE THEY COVERED UNDER THE

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.201
GENERAL A CA.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.669
IS THAT WHY WE DIDN'T COVER HIM

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.237
OR ARE THERE PLANS THAT ARE

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.473
AVAILABLE UNDER THE ACA THAT WE

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:01.343
IS CALIFORNIANS ADOPT.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.911
SO THE PROCESS WHY IS THAT EACH

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.546
STATE WAS SORT OF GIVEN THE

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.849
OPPORTUNITY TO PICK A BENCHMARK%

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.450
PLAN AND WE WERE GIVEN A

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.452
MULTITUDE OF OPTIONS ONE BEING I

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:11.320
THINK THAT.

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:13.288
MOST COMMON SMALL GROUP PLANNED

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.990
THE CALPERS PLAN THE FEDERAL

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:15.724
PLAN.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.393
I'M I BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.895
TWELVE WHEN WE ELECTED OUR FIRST

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.230
BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.331
PART OF THAT WAS THE FEDERAL

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:25.234
GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING TO STATES --

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.336
TO PICK WHAT WAS MOST UTILIZED

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.670
IN THEIR OWN STATE WHICH MADE

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:29.905
THE MOST SENSE THAT THEY SET UP

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:32.107
THE CRITERIA OF THE OF THE TEN

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:34.076
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WHAT

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.511
HAD TO BE INCLUDED.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.479
AND THEN YOU CHOSE FROM THE PLAN

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.548
OPTIONS THAT YOU HAD AVAILABLE

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.049
TO YOU AND SO THERE WAS A

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.117
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THEIR

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.787
CONVERSATIONS THEIR LEGISLATIVE --

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.021
BILLS THAT WERE RUN I KNOW THE

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.289
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAD

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.658
SEVERAL HEARINGS ABOUT WHAT PLAN

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:50.559
MADE THE MOST SENSE FOR

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.161
CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WE WERE

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:53.629
VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AT THE TIME

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:54.496
KNOWING THAT THIS WOULD BE

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:57.566
BASICALLY THE STANDARD FOR WHICH

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:58.634
PEOPLE WOULD PURCHASE.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.336
AT THAT TIME THE KAISER THIRTY

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:02.905
PLUS PLAN THAT WAS CHOSEN --

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.139
DIDN'T INCLUDE HEARING IT'S AN

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:05.474
ACTUAL EXCLUDED COVERAGE FOR

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:08.477
HEARING AIDS -- AND TWENTY

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:09.144
FIFTEEN WE THEN WENT THROUGH THE

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.213
PROCESS AGAIN TO CONSIDER AN

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.881
UPDATE THAT BENCHMARK PLANNED

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.516
THE KAISER THIRTY PLAN WAS AGAIN

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.952
CHOSEN -- WITH REMAINING THAT

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.454
SORT OF EXCLUSIONS SO I THINK

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.056
FROM OUR OUR PLACE.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.559
AS FAR AS THE PROCESS BE

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.927
UNDERSTANDING THAT ONCE WE

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.562
EXCEED THE BENCHMARK PLAN WE'VE

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.664
SORT OF OPENED THE DOOR TO THOSE

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.265
CONVERSATIONS THE STATE THE

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.534
PHRASE THE COST -- FOR ANY

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.636
SERVICE THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.838
THE BENCHMARK PLAN IS.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.840
SO WE JUST SORT OF GENERALLY

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.842
SUGGESTED THAT IF THE STATE IS

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.076
INTERESTED I MEAN CHIROPRACTIC

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.611
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO IT AND

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:43.946
AND WE'VE SEEN MULTITUDE OF

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.247
MANDATES THAT COME BEFORE THE

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.148
LEGISLATURE.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:48.450
THAT THAT'S A BETTER PROCESS TO

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.485
CONSIDER TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:51.920
PROCESS TO LOOK AT THE OPTIONS

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.822
AVAILABLE TO CHOOSE AND

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:55.791
POTENTIALLY CHOOSE A PLAN THAT

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:57.559
INCLUDES COVERAGE FOR HEARING

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.294
AIDS ONE SO THAT YOU PROTECT YOU

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.863
DON'T EXCEED THE BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:01.997
YOU DON'T ASSUME THE FINANCIAL

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.365
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THOSE

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.867
DIFFERENT COSTS OF THE FEDERAL

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.435
GOVERNMENT WON'T COVER.

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.469
I ALSO GIVE THE STATE

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.037
LEGISLATORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.272
CONSIDER WHAT THEY THINK IS THE

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.573
BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR STE

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.808
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.309
THANK YOU SO I THINK MY QUESTION

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:15.410
IS BE ACID EFFORT HUESO AYE I

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:17.112
GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT I

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.614
DON'T TO DUPLICATE ANYTHING SO

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.050
WE'RE ALL SURE THAT THE IN THE

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.518
ACA DID NOT COVER.

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.420
A HEARING FOR THE THEY LEFT IT

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.155
UP TO STATES WHICH WHICH IS KIND

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.024
OF SILLY TO ME I THINK BECAUSE I

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.093
SHOW I'M SURE CALIFORNIA IS NOT

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:31.727
THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS HEARING

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.128
IMPAIRED CHILDREN -- I'M SURE

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.431
THAT GOES OVER ALL FIFTY STATES --

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.433
I WOULD THINK.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.167
SO I WOULD THINK THAT THE

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:39.801
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD COVER

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:40.903
THAT BUT I AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.404
BASH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.572
JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.574
SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.276
IS THAT IF IT IS NOT COVERED ON

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.677
THE FEDERAL SIDE AND IT IS LEFT

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.946
UP TO THE STATE'S THEN MOVED TO

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:51.680
THE BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.148
IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.750
LEGISLATORS ADOPT A BENCHMARK

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:55.751
PLAN.

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.653
THAT IS COVERED -- BY THE STATE

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:02.391
OF CALIFORNIA BUT THEN ADD. TEN

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:03.959
TWELVE TO SIX ITEMS TO THAT PLAN

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.694
THAT COULD OR COULD NOT HAVE A

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.862
SIGNIFICANT COST.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:09.164
WHERE IS THAT FUNDING MECHANISM

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:12.301
COMING FROM [inaudible]

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.670
SIR.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.838
WELL -- TO THE AT THE ANSWER IS

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.373
ACTUALLY THE STATE.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.542
SO IT DOES BECOME A COST TO THE

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.878
STATE TO PROVIDE THAT COVERAGE

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.713
BEYOND THE BENCHMARK PLAN SO WE

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.714
GET TO DECIDE.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.848
WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS WHAT

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:29.117
THE BENCHMARK PLAN IS AND IF WE

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.987
HAD ANYTHING BEYOND THAT -- THEN

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.423
THE STATE IS. FOR FOR AT LEAST

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:37.726
THE PUBLIC PIECES OF IT RIGHT SO --

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.895
THIS UP IT IS ON THE STATE AND

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.697
THEN OF COURSE FOR OTHER PRIME

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.832
INSURERS IT WOULD GET PASSED ON

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.702
TO CONSUMERS RIGHT AS PART OF

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:47.636
AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.538
ANGELES POINT SO WE DON'T MISS

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:50.872
THINGS LIKE THIS AGAIN.

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.774
IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE STUDY

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.310
OR THAT WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW THIS

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.845
IS THE BENCHMARK PLAN WE CHOSE

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.013
BUT THESE ARE THE TEN ITEMS WE

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.349
ADDED TO IT WHICH GIVES US THE

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:01.717
TRUE COST OF WHAT THE ENTIRE.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.385
HEALTH CARE COST IS RIGHT

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:04.619
BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:05.487
THE BENCHMARK PLAN AND SAY THIS

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:06.588
WE PAID X..

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:07.823
BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T PAY

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:10.192
X. IF WE ADDED TEN MORE ITEMS TO

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:10.692
IT.

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.194
IS THERE SOME TYPE OF SOMETHING

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.695
SO WE CAN GET A TRUE COSTS FOR

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:14.329
THE HEALTH CARE.

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:17.466

PERHAPS IN ASTOPS YOU CAN SPEAK

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.888

THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:42.391
IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.633
THE PREMIUMS THAT ARE --

THE ENROLLEES.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:16.878
SO IT IS THE RATES ARE SET TO

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.547

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:21.550

SO THAT'S WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.161
PREMIUM AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.530
BENEFIT MANDATES WE DO CONSIDER

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.499
THE COST TO THE PREMIUM THAT

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:40.068
EVERYBODY PAYS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:40.535

LICENSE MELENDEZ THIS.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.058
BILL TAKE EFFECT SIR.

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:03.959
IF IT GETS SIGNED BY THE

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.794
GOVERNOR WOMEN IN ONE OF THE

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.696
AMENDMENTS HAS THAT -- A I THINK

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:09.764
IT'S JULY OF FOR YEAH TWENTY

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:10.699
TWENTY FIRST MAY TWENTY IT WAS

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.933
GOING TO BE JANUARY ONE BUT SO

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.268
JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.436
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WHO

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.671
FUNDS THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:19.608
PER KID ROUGHLY.

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:22.510
WHO DOES THAT?

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:23.578
I DON'T KNOW THE WOULD.

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.480
UNDER THE PLANS.

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:26.681
BUT WHERE DO YOU COME UP WITH

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.282
THAT MANY I GUESS IS WHAT I'M

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.384
SAYING BECAUSE YOU FILED YOUR

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.151
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS TO

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.586
JUST VERIFY THAT THE THE WAY THE

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:32.787
AMENDMENTS ARE FRAMES.

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:36.258
IS JUST THAT IT'S AT RENEWAL SO

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.959
THE SO THE MOROCCAN SO I AND I

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:39.227
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTIONS

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:40.562
CONCERNS LIKE IS IT DID WHAT IT

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.463
IS.

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:43.565
THAT'S PART IN MINUTES YES OKAY

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:47.736
SO PART OF THE MINUTES IS

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:48.336
PROTECTING THE PLANS OF FILED

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.771
FOR THAT.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:50.572
PART OF THAT.

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.573
RIGHT SO THE SO WHAT I'M WORRIED

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.407
ABOUT IS I THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:53.074
COVERED I THINK THE PLAN SHOULD

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:54.109
COVER THIS I THINK WE SHOULD

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:54.476
HAVE MADE SURE.

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.478
AND THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT --

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.312
CENTRAL BENEFITS THAT IT WAS

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.446
COVERED I GET I GET THAT BUT

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.348
SINCE WE COLLECTIVELY LET THAT

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:00.815
GO.

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.183
AND NOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.618
MANDATING THIS AND THERE BE NO

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.020
RESOURCES TO PAY FOR IT.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.554
AND HAVING PLANS CONTINUE TO

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.690
LEAVE AND NOT HAVE THE

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.526
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PLANS A

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.694
COVERAGE FOR YOU KNOW.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:13.295
PEOPLE IN COVERAGE AND IF YOU

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.297
DON'T HAVE PLANS TO PROVIDE

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:16.931
COVERAGE IT PUTS US IN A BAD

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:18.700
SPOT AND WE MANDATE THINGS ON

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:19.100
PLANS.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:20.802
AND THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.138
CONTROL YOU CAN CONTROL THIS

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.941
CASE VERY SIMILAR TO RATES

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:27.909
APARTMENT INSURANCE.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.377
MY CONCERN IS WHERE THAT MONEY

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.145
COMES FROM BUT THIS WILL NOT

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.012
TAKE EFFECT UNTIL PLANS GET TO

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.747
SUBMIT THEIR NEW RATES TO THE

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:33.281
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE.

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:33.748
CORRECT UNDER THE MY

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:37.118
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- AT

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.254
RENEWAL POLICY RATES WILL BE

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.289
ADJUSTED -- THE ESTIMATE THAT WE

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.391
HAVE FOR WHAT THE COST OF THAT

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.428
WILL BE TO CONSUMERS ARE -- TO

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.296
PLAN MEMBERS IS THE THE RANGE

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:50.031
WOULD BE FROM SIX CENTS PER

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.566
MEMBER PER MONTH IN THE

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.668
INDIVIDUAL MARKET. TO TWELVE

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:56.171
CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH AND

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:58.440
SMALL GROUP PLANS.

01:22:58.506 --> 01:22:59.674
YOU PRICE OUT PLANS IS THAT

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:01.109
ACCURATE I'M QUESTIONING YOU I'M

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.044
JUST ASKING FOR SOMEBODY TO GIVE

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:05.347
ME SOME TYPE OF ACCURACY -- I

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.181
THINK I MEAN THAT'S BASED ON THE

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:07.582
SUBURBAN DALLAS SAYS I MEAN

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.384
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU PURPOSE

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.186
SORT OF TASKED WITH THIS COMING

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.787
OKAY A GENERAL -- ANALYSIS I

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:14.956
THINK OUR ISSUE OR CONCERN AND

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.725
WE BROUGHT THIS UP EARLIER IS.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.160
TO THE DEGREE IF THERE IS IF THE

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.228
REGULATORS A TERMINUS TO BE

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.397
DISCRIMINATORY AND THEREFORE HAS

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.765
TO BE APPLIED TO BOTH CHILDREN

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.934
AND ADULTS THE IMPACT COULD BE

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.102
GREATER AND NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.670
SHOULD BURKE DIDN'T ANALYZE FOR

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:29.904
THE ONLY ANALYZE FOR THE BILL

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.005
AND PRINT.

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.340
IT IN THE CHAIR MENTIONED WHAT

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:33.475
DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:34.976
REGULATORS WILL GO AGAINST THAT

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.478
IN INCLUDING DILTS BECAUSE IT'S

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:37.879
DISCRIMINATORY EVEN THOUGH.

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:39.848
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.383
DETERMINED THAT WELL SO JUST TO

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.118
BE CLEAR -- IT SAID THERE'S A

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.919
POSSIBILITY IT'S IT'S HARD TO

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.788
YES THERE ARE STATES THAT

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.256
ACTUALLY HAVE COVERAGE IT'S ONLY

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.924
KIDS SO IT'S NOT CERTAIN THAT

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:50.792
THEY'LL BE DECLARED

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.227
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.495
BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY AND

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:55.163
WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.664
THEY DO SO THAT'S EITHER

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.133
TEAMMATES SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.401
HEALTH CARE OR DEPARTMENT

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:04.105
SHARON'S.

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.607
DECLARES A DISCRIMINATORY.

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.575
THEN -- THEN.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.210
BASICALLY BE ON THE HOOK.

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.712
FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:12.213
AUTOMATICALLY SO.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.348
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SO

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.150
THAT'S IT THAT'S STATE STATE

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.351
REGULATORS THAT AND THAT'S WHY

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:18.353
ST SO I APPRECIATE -- SUMMER

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.454
BLOOM BRING UP.

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.722
THE STATEMENT FROM HIS OFFICE OF

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.322
CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE FEDERAL

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:21.890
GOVERNMENT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:22.390
TRIGGERED BY THE STATE

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:24.392
REGULATORS IN SEVERAL STATES BY

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.827
THE WAY THE REGULATORS HAVE NOT.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.028
DECLARED DISCRIMINATORY SO THEY

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.563
ACTUALLY HAVE COVERAGE JUST FOR

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.498
KIDS SO IT'S CERTAINLY KNOWS

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.367
THERE'S NO CERTAINTY THAT.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:35.603
THE REGULATORS WILL DECLARE IT --

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.639
DISCRIMINATORY A IN FACT THEM I

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:38.840
THINK WITH THE LAW THE TELLING

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.008
WHICH THAT THE AUTHORS PUT IN

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.243
THAT WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:45.013
OUR HOPE IS THEY WOULD NOT --

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:46.981
BUT I IT BUT TO BE FULLY

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:50.885
TRANSPARENT AS ALWAYS THERE IS A

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:52.287
POSSIBILITY.

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:52.921
BUT WE HAVE GONE TO GREAT

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.389
LENGTHS TO GUARD RAILS AROUND

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.157
THIS I THINK DOCTOR CHAN -- HAD

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.126
A COMMENT IF YOU SIR YES.

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:58.726
JUST A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT THE

01:24:58.793 --> 01:24:59.961
AGE DISCRIMINATION -- ISSUE FROM

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.095
THE MEDICAL AN IDEOLOGICAL

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:01.663
STANDPOINT HEARING LOSS IN

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.131
CHILDREN IS A COMPLETELY

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.699
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND HEARING

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.735
LOSS IN ADULTS IN TERMS OF BOTH

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:09.971
THE IN TERMS ABOUT THE CAUSES

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.173
AND CONSEQUENCES -- THE PRIMARY

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.908
CONCERN FOR HEARING LOSS IN

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.477
CHILDREN IS HOW IT AFFECTS UP

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.745
PERMANENT -- THAT DEVELOPMENT SO

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:19.481
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTS

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.115
AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT WHICH

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:23.218
ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR HEALTH --

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.552
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.588
NOT HEALTH IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:27.922
HEARING LOSS IN ADULTS -- BUT

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.424
THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES BOTH

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:31.793
IN A STANDARD CLINICAL PRACTICE

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:36.631
AND IN -- IN -- IN REGULATORY --

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.566
EXAMPLES WHERE CHILDREN AND

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.168
ADULTS ARE TREATED VERY

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:41.870
DIFFERENTLY AND RULES ARE VERY

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.771
DIFFERENCE -- WITH RESPECT TO

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.440
HEARING LOSS SO I HAVE YOU KNOW

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.508
QUITE A BIT OF CONFIDENCE BASED

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.276
ON WHAT'S HAPPENED OTHER STATES

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:49.911
AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL REALITY

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:52.280
IS THAT -- AGE DISCRIMINATION --

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:56.951
SHOULD HOPEFULLY SHOULD NOT BE

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:57.886
AN ISSUE HERE.

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.921
AND I MY LAST QUESTION I GUESS

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.723
IS THAT IF IT IS A ISSUE IF IT

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:02.590

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.558
YOU TAKE THAT TWELVE CENTS

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:04.425
MULTIPLY IT BY HOW MANY ADULTS.

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.393
WITH THE ADDITIONAL INCREASE

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.161
ESTIMATED COST.

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:07.996
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:17.338
EXACT NUMBER AND TO PURPOSE

01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:18.473

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:34.289
IF WE WERE TO ENTERTAIN THE BILL.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.823

SAFETY ARENA I WOULD USE THE

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:05.380
ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO BILL

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.814
HEAR SIRENS IF YOU'RE DRIVING A

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:07.782
CAR THERE'S A AN INCIDENT GOING

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.484
ON BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:13.287
IS THAT.

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:14.489
TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING.

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.823

HUNDRED DOLLARS SO I WOULD SAY

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.443
THE TRENDS ARE THAT.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.378
IF YOU PUT A A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:38.880

BE CLEAR -- NO WE PICK A

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.072
DIFFERENT PLAN FOR BENCHMARK

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:19.674
PLANNED THAT WILL ALSO HAVE THE

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.276
FACTS ON THE OVERALL PREMIUM

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.078
RATES ACROSS THE BOARD RIGHT IT

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:27.615
BECOMES AND THE I'M SURE THE

PACKAGE IN IN THAT NEGOTIATION

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:40.061
OF THAT WAS ATTENTION RIGHT.

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:40.728
RIGHT YES I AM ITS RIGHT EXACTLY

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:41.896
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THAT WAS

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.264
PART OF THE TENSION WE TRIED TO

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:43.898
DECIDE THE BENCHMARK PLAN AND I

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:44.765
THINK MANY OF US WANTED

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:45.766
SOMETHING A LITTLE.

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:48.336
BROADER -- THEN WE LANDED ON

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:48.936
BECAUSE THERE'S ATTENTION THE

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:52.506
BROADER IT IS THE HIGHER THE

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:53.841

PAIN THOSE PREMIUMS AND AND SO

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:00.681
THAT IT THAT WAS THE BACK AND

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:03.184
FORTH AND SO I THINK THAT -- BUT

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:05.419
I THINK WE SHOULD THE NEXT THEN

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.787
WE SHOULD BE EXPLORED THAT AND

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.022
AND AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT TENSION

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.924
IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:10.491
SOMETHING LIKE HEARING LOSS

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:11.459
PARTICULARLY.

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:14.161
IN KIDS I MEAN THAT DOES BEG THE

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:15.496
QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT THAT

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:16.430
SOMETHING YOU REALLY SHOULD BE

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.698
COVERING AND WHY ARE WE NOT

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:19.300
DOING IT SO SO CERTAINLY WE NEED

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:20.635
TO PUT THAT.

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:21.636
TABLE I WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.938
THAT IT WAS MENTIONED AND AGAIN

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:26.374
I WANT TO THANK -- THE SEMINAR

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.074
FOR WORKING -- WITH THE

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:28.576
COMMITTEE STAFF YEAH WE DO

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:31.879
PERMITS THE PLANS TO AND GET TO

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:34.615
TO DO SO SOME COST SHARING SO --

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:42.657
TO IT SO THAT THERE IS -- SO

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.424
THAT THE PEOPLE BE PRUDENT

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:44.859
PURCHASERS AND JUST NOT TRYING

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.093
TO YOU KNOW RUN UP THE LIMITS --

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.695
THAT THERE THAT THAT -- SO FORTH --

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.730
AND I THINK AGAIN IT'S THOSE ARE

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:52.166
IMPORTANT -- COST MEASURES THAT

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.534
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE PEOPLE CHOICE

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:54.368
AND ALLOW THEM TO GET A QUALITY

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:56.637
PRODUCT -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:57.838
RECOGNIZING WE HAVE TO BE

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.106
PRUDENT PURCHASERS WEIRD THE

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.374
POLICY COMMITTEE SO I THINK

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:01.475
PROCREATION WE'LL HAVE SOME

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:02.810
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT COST BECAUSE

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:04.211
WE ARE ON THE HOOK.

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.179
FOR EVERYONE IN THE INDIVIDUAL

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.547
MARKET FOR THE INCREASED COST

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:08.082
AND IN ONE SMALL GROUP MARKET SO

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:09.817
THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:10.818
THAT PROCREATION IS WILL DEAL

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:11.352
WITH.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.520
BUT I WOULD SAY ALSO

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.655
FUNDAMENTALLY -- AS A

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:16.657
DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN THE

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:17.892
FIRST QUESTION.

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.026
THEY ASK WHEN WE HAVE A CHILD

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.861
WHO IS A DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:25.166
CAM DAY HERE AND CAN THEY SEE.

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:27.401
AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO.

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.637
AND WE DON'T FIX THAT PROBLEM

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.405
AND THEY CAN'T HEAR OR THEY

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:32.640
CAN'T SEE RIGHT IF TROUBLE WITH

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:33.841
THAT.

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:38.913
WE CAN'T GO BEYOND THAT RIGHT WE

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.514
IT'S IT'S LIKE -- FIND THE QUEUE

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:41.148
WE KNOW THEY HAVE HEARING LOSS

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:41.782
AND MAYBE THEY HAVE SOME OTHER

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:42.984
THINGS GOING ON BEYOND THAT AND

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.418
THAT'S WHY THERE'S DELAYED

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:45.853
SPEECH OR WHATEVER ELSE.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.888
BUT WITHOUT FIXING THE HEARING

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.623
YOU JUST CAN'T GO YOU KEEP

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.692
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE.

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:52.727
YOU CAN DO THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.061
EFFECTIVE FUNNELED THE HEARING

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:55.863
AND AND SO THAT COST GOES BEYOND

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.665
MEDICAL COSTS I MEAN.

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.867
AND AND THERE'S CRITICAL PEERS

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:01.669
THE DEVELOPMENT I KNOW THAT --

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:03.738
THE GOOD THAT I DON'T KNOW LIKE

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.172
I JUST KNOW THIS IS THAT ONCE A

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:05.806
CRITICAL PERIOD DEVELOPMENT IF

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.208
WE DON'T FIX THAT PROBLEM WITHIN

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.676
A WINDOW OF TIME IT'S NOT LIKE

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.611
WE CAN GO BACK IN TIME AND FIX

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:11.245
IT LATER.

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.847
THAT PROBLEM BECOMES MORE

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:18.352
PERMANENT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:19.720
SHIPS THE WAY THE BRAIN DEVELOPS.

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:20.588
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE FIND

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.723
THE PROBLEM WE SCREEN FOR THE

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.125
PROBLEM WE THAT'S WHAT WE SCREEN

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:24.859
FOR A NEW BUNCH WHEN WE FIND

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.093
PROBLEMS SCREEN FRONT OF WE

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.129
DON'T ADDRESS IT.

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:29.597
IN A CERTAIN WINDOW OF TIME.

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:31.632
THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE THAT

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:34.368
PERMANENT FOR THAT CHILD IS THE

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:35.836
BECOME AN ADULT THAT.

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:37.171
BECOMES A PERMANENT ISSUE IN

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.340
TERMS OF THEIR FUTURE LEARNING

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:40.441
THE PENDULUM NOW OF COURSE

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:41.742
BECOMES A PERMANENT ISSUE BY THE

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.177
WAY FOR ALL OF US IS A

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:44.445
COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:45.880
AND SO THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:48.816
I'M VERY RELUCTANT TO GO BEYOND.

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:51.018
THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.521
THAT -- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:54.188
SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:55.956
PERHAPS THE REAL SOLUTION IS IN

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:57.291
THE FUTURE IS THAT WE'RE GOING

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.225
TO REWORK OUR SEXUAL HEALTH

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:59.760
BENEFITS AND WITH ALL THE

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.395
CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY INVOLVE TO

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:02.797
IN TERMS OF COST AND OTHER TYPES

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:03.597
OF THINGS.

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:06.000
SO -- IT MAYBE THAT IS REALLY

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.068
AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITE

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.502
SAY THAT PRIDE RELEASED THE

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.937
BETTER ANSWER IN THE LONG RUN

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:11.739
BUT I FEEL THAT EVEN THE SHORT

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:13.174
RUN WE STILL NEED TO DEAL WITH

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.010
THIS AND AND TAKE CARE OF AND

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:17.144
THAT'S WHY I AM GOING.

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:21.015
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY --

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:22.216
SUMMER BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:25.019
CLOSE THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY --

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:27.321
MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE FOR A

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.056
REALLY JUST SUMMARIZE SOME OF

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:31.125
THE THINGS THAT -- THAT I WAS

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:33.360
INTENDING TO SAY AND AND CLOSING

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:35.729
COM I THINK THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:37.531
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:40.534
KIND OF BREACHING THE THE THE

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:42.136
WALL OPENING UP THE FLOODGATES

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:44.271
AS AS WE HEARD FROM FROM THE

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:48.809
OPPOSITION -- THE LIST -- THE

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:50.411
LEGISLATURE -- AND THE STATE

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.813
HAVE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT AND

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.949
NOT -- IN IN BEING VERY STRICT

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:56.784
ABOUT -- HOW THESE ITEMS ARE

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:58.986
REVIEWED -- BUT AS YOU SAID

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:01.589
MISTER CHAIR I DOUBT THAT THERE

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.723
IS IN YOU WOULD KNOW BTTER THAN

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.458
HIGH THAT THERE'S ANYONE ELSE

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.727
WHO IS ASKED FOR AN EXCEPTION TO

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:09.063
THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT ANY

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:09.597
OTHER.

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:14.268
CONDITION THAT WOULD -- INVOLVES

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.837
A LIFETIME A POTENTIAL LIFETIME

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.572
OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:21.509
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:23.544
A MATCH IN THESE CHILDREN WHO

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.546
ARE HERE TODAY WITH THEIR

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:31.352
PARENTS -- NOT HAVING THE ACCESS

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:33.053
TO HEARING AIDS NOT HAVING THE

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.257
AXIS IN THERE ARE -- TWO TO

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:36.824
THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN EVERY

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:39.326
YEAR WHO ARE NOT GETTING HEARING

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.762
AIDS HEARING AIDS AT ALL BECAUSE

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:45.699
OF THE COST AND IT'S JUST NOT

01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:49.170
HAPPENING -- THOSE CHILDREN.

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:53.107
ARE GOING -- TO BEAR THE

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:55.476
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT -- DECISION

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:56.577
THAT'S BEING MADE BY US THE

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.046
ADULTS IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM.

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:00.414
I HAVE.

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.550
YES WE MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:04.385
THIS WHEN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:08.122
BENEFITS -- ARE UP FOR REVIEW.

01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:09.657
IF WE CHOOSE TO REVIEW THEM.

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:12.293
IF WE DO IT AT A POINT IN TIME

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:14.962
IT'S UNCERTAIN WHEN THAT WOULD.

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.030
HAPPEN WE KNOW WHEN IT COULD

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.499
START BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:21.101
WHEN IT ACTUALLY STARTS OR WHEN

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:24.171
IT ACTUALLY FINISHES -- AND THEN

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.107
AT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:29.743
HUMONGOUS FIGHT OVER WHAT IS

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.445
THEN INCLUDED IN THE PLANS AND

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:34.481
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THIS IS A

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:35.049
THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT WE'RE

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:35.816
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:38.519
A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:41.755
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE -- VERY

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.290
LITTLE POLITICAL POWER IN

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.926
REALITY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.861
WILL BE SEEKING BENEFITS ALL OF

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:50.264
WHICH MAY BE A VERY IMPORTANT

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:51.865
BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE SEEKING SO

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.667
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE.

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.336
THAT IT WILL HAPPEN THEN AND SO

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:57.805
THEN WHAT FOR ALL OF THOSE

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:59.173

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.011
TAKING A LOOK AT THIS BILL IT

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.345
WAS JUST AMENDED -- ABOUT A WEEK

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.213
AND A HALF AGO.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.282
WE HAVE HAD SOME EXTENSIVE

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.384
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.952
AND SPONSORS WHICH WE FOUND TO

01:49:19.019 --> 01:49:20.887
BE MEANINGFUL HELPFUL BUT YOU

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:21.755
KNOW.

01:49:21.821 --> 01:49:23.590
WE DO VIEW AS THE BILL --

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:25.492
REQUIRING A PRETTY EXPANSIVE

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:27.327
COLLECTION OF DETAILED PERSONAL

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:28.828
HEALTH INFORMATION IN PROVIDER

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:30.430
RATES AND THAT ALWAYS MAKES US

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:31.564
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE REVIEW

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:33.366
THAT INFORMATION IS PROPRIETARY

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:35.068
IN NATURE.

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.036
SOME.

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:38.872
THE MEASURE ALSO JUST REQUIRES

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:40.206
DISCLOSURE OF X..

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:41.708
AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF OFF

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:44.678
RELATED TO MARKETS THAT ARE

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:46.346
OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF COVERED

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:47.948
CALIFORNIA -- INCLUDING DATA

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:49.916
RELATED TO THE EMPLOYER MARKETS

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:51.384
AND MEDI CAL OF COURSE WE WOULD

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:52.852
HAVE REGULATORS OVER MEDI CAL

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:55.055
AND OVER ON THE EMPLOYER MARKETS

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.656
AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.558
CLEAR JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:01.061
COVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS IS DATA.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:04.698
FOR MARKETS IT DOESN'T OVERSEE

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:06.733

TECHNICALLY ARE OR HOW THEY WILL

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:09.569
USE IT -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:12.238
PORTION OF THE BILL NEEDS TO BE

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:13.974
TAKEN OUT -- MUCH OF THE

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:14.941
INFORMATION THAT WILL BE

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:17.477
TRANSFERRED TO COVER CALIFORNIA --

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:19.579
IS PROPRIETARY NATURE -- WELL

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:21.815
THERE'S AN ATTEMPT IN THE BILL

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:23.550
TO LIMIT THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.118
PROPRIETARY DATA.

01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:26.252
THE BILL STILL REQUIRES A

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:29.522
SUBMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA TO

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:31.458

THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM --

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:39.833
IS THAT WE CONSIDER PROPRIETARY

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:42.736
IS PROTECTED -- UNDER THE BILL --

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:43.970
FOR INSTANCE LIKE TO SPECIFIC

PLANS USED TO LOWER COST REDUCE

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:50.276
HEALTH DISPARITIES IN INCREASE

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:51.211

01:50:53.847 --> 01:50:55.915
IN THE PROVIDERS -- AND THIS

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:57.517
INVOLVES INCENTIVES AND

01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:59.519
DISINCENTIVES USED TO DRIVE A

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.521
QUALITY AND DRIVE DOWN ON

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.823
DISPARITIES -- THE PLANS OF

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:04.657

COMPETITORS TO EVER GET A HOLD

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.294
OF THIS INFORMATION -- AND WE'RE

01:51:08.361 --> 01:51:09.362
NOT SURE THE PROVIDERS WOULD

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.164
WANT THIS INFORMATION REVEALED

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:12.399
AS WELL.

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:16.202
HARMS THE MARKET AND COMPLICATES

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.871
OUR EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS -- WE

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:18.938
DO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.607
COMBATING HEALTH DISPARITIES IN

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:21.641
MAKING QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS --

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:22.242
YOU KNOW THE OTHER POINT WILL

MAKE YOU SOME OF THE DATA

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:24.177
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ISSUES ARE

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.545
NOT CONSISTENT AMONG PLANS

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:26.780
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT STANDARDIZED

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:27.814
BY ANY TYPE OF ACCREDITING

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:28.782

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.050
THAT.

01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:32.018
SO NOT SURE HOW USE LITTLE IT'LL

01:51:32.085 --> 01:51:32.819
BE.

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:33.787

FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:33.599
AND WE THINK THAT'S PLENTY OF

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.868
TIME TO RESOLVE IT IN A

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.002

THE BILL.

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.374
THAT WE SEE IS JUST A MEASURE TO

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:16.375
DIRECT ONE AGENCY TO TRANSFER

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:18.477

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:25.150
IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO THINK OF

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:26.585

INSIDIOUS AS LEAD EXPOSURE AND

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:38.364
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:39.598

ABOUT HALF THE TIME THEY'RE

PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION WHEN

02:06:01.754 --> 02:06:03.022
THEY REPORT COMPLAINTS BUT IT'S

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:04.757
SO COMMON THAT WE ESSENTIALLY

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:06.158
HAVE TO COUNSEL WORKERS THAT.

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:07.359

EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET MORE

02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:15.134

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:17.870
AND WITH LEAD EXPOSURE IT'S

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:19.305
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY

02:06:19.371 --> 02:06:20.806
ONCE WE GOT A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.708

THAT'S BY DEFINITION OF A

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:27.313
SERIOUS PHYSICAL AND A SERIOUS

02:06:27.379 --> 02:06:29.114
PHYSICAL HARM IN THAT IT MEETS

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:31.250
THE CRITERIA FOR BEING A SERIOUS

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:33.085

INVESTIGATION BY CAL OSHA.

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:35.621
AND AGAIN AS MENTIONED THIS BILL

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.589
DOESN'T REQUIRE AN INSPECTION

02:06:37.656 --> 02:06:38.991
ALL IT DOES IS GIVE THE

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:40.392
APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO THE

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:41.627
APPROPRIATE AGENCIES SO THAT

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:42.761
THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION

02:06:42.828 --> 02:06:44.263
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT.

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.664
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:47.666
A PHYSICAL INSPECTION AND AS IS

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:48.801
OFTEN THE CASE THEY CAN TELL

FROM THEIR INITIAL INSPECTION

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:51.470

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:53.005
THEY NEED TO DO ONE AND WHETHER

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:53.672
OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.607

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.409

HANDS OF CD PH THEN.

02:06:58.544 --> 02:07:00.112
NOT ONLY MAKES IT A LOT MORE

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:01.680
LIKELY THAT THE HAZARD OF LEAD

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:02.848
EXPOSURE CONTINUES BUT THAT A

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.016
WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER SAFETY

THIS BILL USES IN ORDER -- IN

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.009
HOW IT DIVIDE THE

I'M WE BELIEVE THERE IS A BETTER

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:09.648
SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH WE HAVE

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:10.849

EFFICIENT IN PROTECTING WORKERS

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:22.327
EFFICIENT FOR THE BUSINESS AND

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:25.697
AT AND IS AS WE REDID.

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:26.298
EFFICIENT FOR THE COST OF THE

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:31.437
STATE -- SIR TO TO CLARIFY -- AS

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:32.304
JUST STATED WE DO THINK THERE'S

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:33.005
AN ISSUE WITH THE DISCRETION

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:33.906
PRESENTLY ALLOWED TO DEPARTMENT

02:08:33.972 --> 02:08:35.340
OF HEALTH THEIR DISCRETION WHEN

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:37.843
THEY FOR THE CASE TO CAL OSHA IS --

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:39.111
IS OVER BROUGHT AND THERE HAVE

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:40.212
BEEN ISSUES THERE AND WE

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:42.181
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT YOU MEAN TO

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:43.849
DEFEND THEIR FAILURE TO FORWARD.

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.184
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE IN OUR

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:46.318
AMENDMENTS THE SOLUTION TO THAT

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:47.653
OVER DISCRETION.

02:08:47.719 --> 02:08:49.121
IS TO LIMIT THEIR DISCRETION

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:51.056
WITH GUARD RAILS NOT TO THROW

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.424
THEM OUT O THE PROCESS AND WE

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:53.859
BELIEVE THAT THEY PROVIDE SOME

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.894
VALUABLE -- ROLES IN TIMES OF

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:57.963
THEIR COLLABORATIVE PROCESS.

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:58.831
SO FAR AMENDMENTS AND AND WE ARE

02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:00.799
IN TALKS ABOUT THESE WOULD LIMIT

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:02.067
THAT TO A SCHEDULED TO SAY YOU

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.502

DEAL WITH THIS TO PROVIDE A

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:06.605
QUICK SOLUTION IF YOU CAN'T.

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:09.208
THEN KICK IT TO CAL OSHA HAVE

02:09:09.274 --> 02:09:11.910
BEEN TREATED SERIOUS VIOLATION

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:14.313
AS THE BILL DOES PRESENTLY --

02:09:14.379 --> 02:09:16.281
YEAH I HAVE ONE QUICK EXAMPLE --

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:17.049

THE FACTS ABOUT THIS SO.

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:20.419
BECAUSE BLOOD LEVELS RIGHT RISE

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:22.488
OVER TIME AND FALL OVER TIME ONE

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:23.255
OF THE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL WE

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:48.680
THE LEVELS GOING TO GO UP.

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:49.681
RIGHTS THEY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL

THOSE WILL BE FIXED OVER TIME

ALSO CHANGES THE AMBIENCE LEAD

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:09.114
LEVELS IN THE AIR BUT IT DOESN'T

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:10.549

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:14.886
REFERRED TO CAL OSHA FOR

02:13:14.953 --> 02:13:16.421
INSPECTION THE INSPECTION

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:17.122
ACTUALLY IT'S CALLED NOT

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:18.957
REFERRAL BUT A COMPLAINT TO

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.492
TECHNICALLY AS THAT WOULD CAL

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:21.193
OSHA CALLS IT.

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:23.261
SHOULD BE A COMPLAINT FROM THEY

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:25.330
SAID THEY GET TEN TO THIRTEEN

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.698
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS A YEAR FOR

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.133
ALL DIFFERENT WORKS WORK THINGS

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:28.734
SO.

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:29.601
THIS LOOKING AT THE DATA WOULD

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:32.704
ADD A FEW DOZEN MORE THIRTY

02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:33.872
EIGHTY MORE AND THEY SAID WE CAN

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:34.773
HANDLE THAT AN APPROACH THEY

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.541
SAID. SEVEN HUNDRED ABOUT SEVEN

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:38.410
OR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:39.144
TO HANDLE THIS INCREASED

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.178
WORKLOAD.

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:41.713
WE JUST SUPPOSE THAT AGAINST YOU

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.048
KNOW OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:44.049
DOLLARS IN MEDICAL COSTS FOR

02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:46.385
PEOPLE WHO LOSE WORK TIME AND

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.253
GET SICK TREMORS -- NERVE DAMAGE

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.654
HEART DISEASE CAUSED BY HIGH

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:50.522
BLOOD LEVELS.

02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:52.557
AND I WOULD ARGUE MILLIONS MORE

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.960
TO ADD STAFFING DPH TO ACTUALLY.

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:57.262
DO WHAT IS BEING SUGGESTED BY

02:13:57.329 --> 02:14:00.365
OPPOSITION TO BEEF UP FOR THEM

02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:02.634
TO FOLLOW UP ON BEFORE SENDING

02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.736
IT OVER TO OSHA ACTIVATED RIGHT

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:06.638
NOW PART OF THE REASON WHY --

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:08.807
DPH ISN'T FALLING THROUGH

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:09.341
AWESOME THIS THERE'S

02:14:09.408 --> 02:14:11.710
UNDERSTAFFED -- THE PUSH TO THE

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:12.944
THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIVE

02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:15.213
ARMS OSHA -- AND DPH IS NOT

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.048
KICKED OUT OF THE PROCESS TO PHD

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.049
AS PART OF THE PROCESS THE WHOLE

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:19.317
TIME TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:20.051
THE PROCESS.

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:21.620
SO THAT IF AN INVESTIGATION DONE

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:23.522
BY OSHA SHOWS THAT THERE'S SOME

02:14:23.588 --> 02:14:24.489
PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE WORK

02:14:24.556 --> 02:14:26.024
SITE THAT DON'T REALLY LEND

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:28.360
ITSELF TO A LARGE MINOR CITATION

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:31.430
OR OF BUT WAS STORED AND AT

02:14:31.496 --> 02:14:33.432
FIRST THEY CAN WORK WITH DPH TO

02:14:33.498 --> 02:14:34.399
PICK SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WAS.

02:14:34.466 --> 02:14:35.700
REFERRED TO AS THE HAND WASHING

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:36.768
ISSUE OR SOMETHING MINOR LIKE

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:45.777
THAT DPH IS STILL VERY MUCH PART

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:47.913
OF THE PROCESS.

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:49.147
SO THESE EMPLOYER IN A REPORT TO

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:50.515
BOTH AGENCIES CENTERS THERE ONE

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.150
BLOOD TESTS THAT SUBMITTED TO

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.785
BOTH AGENCIES THE AGAINST AN

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:55.687
ENTITY PH AND THEN DPH WITHOUT

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.889
THE TRANSMITTED THAT'S ABOUT THE

02:14:57.956 --> 02:15:00.559
ELEVATED LEVEL TO OSHA.

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:04.262
OKAY IF I COULD BRIEFLY CLARIFY --

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:05.864
I'LL BE VERY PRETTY.

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:07.699
LAID THE AFTERNOON -- ONE OF THE

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:08.667
ISSUES WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:09.234
ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT THE

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.068
PRESENTLY COMING DOWN THE PIPE

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:11.169
LED REGULATIONS -- REFLECT

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:12.204
DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT PRESENTLY

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.271
EXISTS AND THIS BILLS TWENTY IS

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:14.639
NOT ACTUALLY TIED TO A NUMBER

02:15:14.706 --> 02:15:15.540
THAT RACK ONE OF THE MEN WITH

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:15.874
YOU PROPOSED.

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:16.541
IS TO HAVE THIS BILL REFER TO A

02:15:16.608 --> 02:15:17.175
LEVEL IN THE REGULATIONS THAT

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:18.410
HAS THE REGULATIONS CHANGE THIS

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:19.778
BILL WILL SHIFT WITH IT -- I

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:24.349
THINK THAT SOME THE TWENTY OTHER

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:25.717
IS PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND IN HERE

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:27.686
SUCH THAT IF COLLISON THE FUTURE

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:29.921
DOES ADOPT STRICTER REGULATIONS

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:32.157
PURSUANT TO THEIR OF ON GOING.

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:33.225
PROCESS THAT THIS WOULD THIS

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:34.960
WOULD CHANGE ALONG WITH CAL

02:15:35.026 --> 02:15:38.163

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:26.044
ALMOST THE EXACT SAME BILL AB.

02:16:26.111 --> 02:16:27.379
TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE AND

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:29.314
GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED IT --

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:31.016
CLAIMING THIS DEPARTMENT HEALTH

02:16:31.082 --> 02:16:32.183
WORKS FOR QUIET CORNER

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.085
COLLABORATIVELY WITH EMPLOYERS

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.453
TO REDUCE.

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.354
WORKER EXPOSURE TO LETTER REFERS

02:16:36.421 --> 02:16:38.390
EMPLOYERS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.358
ENFORCEMENT UPDATED ON A CASE BY

02:16:40.425 --> 02:16:42.661
CASE BASIS SO WE SEE A DECREASE

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.429
INCIDENCE A HIGHER SENSITIVITY.

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:46.498
AND SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING

02:16:46.565 --> 02:16:47.065
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:48.667
PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:49.734
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BILL.

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.169
I DON'T BELIEVE THE SYSTEM HAS

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.804
BEEN WORKING IN A BIG DROP IN

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.573
THOSE CASES REPORTED CASES THE

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.241
FACT THAT EXCITE WAS CLOSED.

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:57.943
THAT WAS A BIG BUT A NUMBER OF

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:59.578
THOSE CASES THE TWENTY

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:02.247
MICROGRAMS IS WHAT OSHA IS

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:03.348
RECOMMENDING SWIRL THAT WERE

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:04.316
BURGER LYING ON OUR EXPERTS TO

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:05.817
TELL US WHAT.

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.686
THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE A WHAT IS

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.554
OUR SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THAT

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:10.789
ONE OF THE OTHER RECORDING

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.891
SUSPENDED AND CENTERS FOR

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:13.758

DATA YES THE FEDERAL -- LEVEL OF

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.895
RESPONSE I BELIEVE IS TWENTY

02:17:16.962 --> 02:17:18.296
FIVE MAY BE STAFFERS THIS TWENTY

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:19.598
FIVE PIC CALLOW SHOULD TOLD US

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:21.733
LAST YEAR WHEN WE'RE DING AB

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:22.300
TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE THAT.%

02:17:22.367 --> 02:17:23.568
USE TWENTY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:29.574
THAT IT'S A BETTER LEVEL MORE

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:31.309
PROTECTIVE OF WORKER HEALTH.

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:31.910
THAT SO THAT'S WHERE THE COMES

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:32.811
FROM SO FEDERAL ACTION LEVELS

02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:34.212
TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA BE TWENTY

02:17:34.279 --> 02:17:36.181
OTHER STATES HE'S TWENTY ALSO.

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:40.752
OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:17:40.819 --> 02:17:43.388
THE SERVER.

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:44.856
I JUST LIKE THAT I JUST HAVE ONE

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:45.523
MORE QUESTION SO IT SAYS IN THE

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:46.124
LANGUAGE THAT THE BILL WOULD

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:46.858
FURTHER PROVIDE THAT THE ABOVE

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:48.526
DESCRIBED REPORT WOULD CAN TO

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:49.494
CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS VIOLATION

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:51.830
WITH OSHA -- IS A SERIOUS

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:52.731
VIOLATION WITH OSHO WITHOUT AN

02:17:52.797 --> 02:17:54.532
INVESTIGATION TO SHOW THAT THE

02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:57.435
GUY STARTED -- WITH YOU KNOW

02:17:57.502 --> 02:17:58.570
HIGH BLOOD LEVELS OR IS IT JUST

02:17:58.637 --> 02:17:59.838
AN AUTOMATIC SERIOUS VIOLATION

02:17:59.904 --> 02:18:02.107
FIND WHICH COULD BE THOUSANDS

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:03.875
UPON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND

02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:04.809
AND AS IT CAME OUT WITH IS THAT

02:18:04.876 --> 02:18:05.543
THE TERM OF ART THAT ACTUALLY

02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:07.045
TRIGGERS.

02:18:07.112 --> 02:18:09.080
THE THE INVESTIGATION IT DOESN'T

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:11.016
REQUIRE A CONCLUSION OF THE

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:13.151
INVESTIGATION TO BE ANY

02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:14.686
WORDS.

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:16.855
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T BUT

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:19.257
BECAUSE OF THAT THIS YEAR'S

02:18:19.324 --> 02:18:20.225
VIOLATIONS THE TRIGGERING A

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.693
TRIGGERING TERM.

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.395
BY TRIGGERING IT NOW -- CHICKEN

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.597
BASKET THEY CAN DO BUT THERE'S

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:26.197
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE INDIAN

02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:27.365
THAT THERE WAS A ONE OFF THAT

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:28.967
PARTICULAR DAY THAT'S NOT

02:18:29.034 --> 02:18:29.601
RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF THE

02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:30.268
BUSINESS.

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:31.670
BY NATE BY LABELING A SERIOUS

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:32.837
VIOLATION IN NO WAY DOES THAT

02:18:32.904 --> 02:18:34.839
PREJUDICE -- THE EMPLOYER WHAT

02:18:34.906 --> 02:18:39.911
IT DOES IT TRIGGERS A TRIGGERS

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:42.280
INVESTIGATION.

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:43.548
SO I HAVE TO PICK A DIFFERENT

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:46.151
BECAUSE I'M EMPLOYER AND DIVERT

02:18:46.217 --> 02:18:48.586
IN TWENTY SIX YEARS -- SHOULD ON

02:18:48.653 --> 02:18:50.655
RIDERSHIP ONE TIME FOR AN INJURY

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:53.091
THAT TOOK PLACE IN IN IN IN

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:55.026
INDUSTRY -- THAT WE WERE DEEMED

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:57.796
NOT RESPONSIBLE BUT AN BUT TO

02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:59.297
HAVE A SERIOUS VIOLATION AGAINST

02:18:59.364 --> 02:19:01.232
YOU UNDER CAL OSHA PROHIBITS YOU

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:02.233
FROM HAVING CONTRACTS.

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:03.301
PROHIBIT YOU FROM GAINING

02:19:03.368 --> 02:19:05.670
CONTRACTS ESPECIALLY IN THE OIL

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:06.504
INDUSTRY THE AG INDUSTRY THE

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:07.372
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THERE'S A

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:08.373
LOT OF THINGS THAT AFFECT

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:09.841
EMPLOYERS AND IF THERE'S IS AN

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.509
AUTOMATIC SERIOUS VIOLATION

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:11.910
ATTACHED TO THIS.

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:12.343
WHEN THERE?

02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:13.945
COULD BE A FINDING OF NO GUILT

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:15.346
WHATSOEVER THAT THAT'S A HUGE

02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:16.014
CONCERN.

02:19:16.081 --> 02:19:17.382
AND THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:18.950
CONCLUSION OF THOSE SHOWS THAT

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.685
THERE IS NO VIOLATION IT IT'S

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:22.187
IT'SLABELING ISSUES VIOLATION

02:19:22.253 --> 02:19:23.521
FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRICKING THE

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:24.622
INVESTIGATION.

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.790
BUT THEN OCEAN WILL DO THE

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.425
INVESTIGATION AT THE CONCLUSION

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:28.727
OF THE INVESTIGATION -- SHALL

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:32.130
DECIDE WHAT -- WHAT WE'LL DO

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.698
WHAT WILL BUT THE CONCLUSION OF

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:35.533
THAT INVESTIGATION WILL BE?

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:36.134
THE DON'T YOU THINK IT SHOULD

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:37.669
SAY AS IT WOULD THIS THAT THE

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:38.303
BILL WOULD FURTHER PROVIDE THAT

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:40.438
THE ABOVE -- DESCRIBE REPORT

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:41.306
WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:43.341
ALLEGED VIOLATION INSTEAD OF A

02:19:43.408 --> 02:19:50.582
MANDATED SERIOUS VIOLATION.

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:52.450
THIS MIMICS FEDERAL LANGUAGE AS

02:19:52.517 --> 02:19:53.251
TO HOW AN INVESTIGATION IS

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:56.187
TRIGGERED BUT ONCE AGAIN -- THAT

02:19:56.254 --> 02:19:56.755
THE THE DEEMING A BIT OF A

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:57.622
SERIOUS VIOLATION IS FOR THE

02:19:57.689 --> 02:19:58.590
PURPOSE THE TRIGGERING THE

02:19:58.656 --> 02:20:00.291
INVESTIGATION -- SECOND TEAM

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:01.292
THAT THERE IS NO VIOLATION THE

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:02.026
CONDITION THAT THERE'S NO

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:03.862
CITATION THEY CONTEND THAT THE

02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:05.463
COULD BE A REALLY QUICK FIX --

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:07.799
AND SO AGAIN IT'S A TERM OF ART --

02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:09.834
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:12.070
BE ON A PERMANENT RECORD

02:20:12.137 --> 02:20:13.972
BUSINESS THE EXTENT THAT OSHO

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:15.106
DEEMED A SERIOUS VIOLATION.

02:20:15.173 --> 02:20:16.908
THAT TRIGGERS THE INVESTIGATION

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:18.276
AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T THIS MIMICS

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:20.311
FEDERAL LAW -- IN TERMS WHAT

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:22.113
WOULD REQUIRE -- BUT LAUNCH AN

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.884
INVESTIGATION ACCORDING TO

02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:27.285
FEDERAL LAW AS WELL.

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:28.987
THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU.

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:31.523
THE OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible]

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:34.225
OKAY SO.

02:20:34.292 --> 02:20:37.028
SOME OF HER AYE -- JEFF FISHER

02:20:37.095 --> 02:20:38.630
YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD.

02:20:38.696 --> 02:20:39.731
YEAH I I THINK WAS AS WE

02:20:39.798 --> 02:20:41.166
DISCUSSED BEFORE -- AND AND I

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:41.766
APPRECIATE WHAT THE OPPOSITION

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:43.301
SAYING BUT FRANKLY THE THE PART

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:44.836
OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- AT LEAST

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:46.538
RIGHT NOW DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:48.973
THE STAFF TO DO MUCH OF AN

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.376
INVESTIGATION BEYOND WE RECEIVED

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:52.911
THE BLOOD LOVE LEVEL TEST AND

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:54.279
REVIEW THEM AND SAY.

02:20:54.345 --> 02:20:56.614
AND SO FORTH AND AND ACTUALLY

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:57.715
YOU KNOW SINCE I CHAIR THE

02:20:57.782 --> 02:20:58.483
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEALTH AND

02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:59.951
HUMAN SERVICES AYE I ACTUALLY

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:01.419
HOPE THAT PERHAPS THE CHAMBER

02:21:01.486 --> 02:21:02.754
AND OTHERS MIGHT ACTUALLY PUT IN

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:05.190
A BUDGET REQUEST FOR MORE STAFF

02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:05.657
FOR THE LEAD.

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:07.525
THAT FOR THE OCCUPATIONAL LED

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:08.993
THE VISION.

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.061
FOR THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH --

02:21:10.128 --> 02:21:11.763
BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:15.934
PROPOSED TO FAR SO -- OUR WORK

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:16.768
WITH THE GOVERNOR TO TO INCREASE

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:17.535
THE STAFFING SO THAT THEY COULD

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:19.571
HAVE MORE CAPACITY TO DO SO BUT

02:21:19.637 --> 02:21:20.872
I THINK IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT.

02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:22.607
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO ON SITE

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:24.375
INVESTIGATIONS TO FIGURE OUT AND

02:21:24.442 --> 02:21:27.846
CAL OSHA IS THE AGENCY THAT'S

02:21:27.912 --> 02:21:29.914
CHARGED WITH THE LEAST ONSITE

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:32.817
INVESTIGATIONS -- SO -- TO ME

02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:35.854
WELL IT'S NOT IDEAL -- IT IT DID

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.856
GIVEN THE REALITIES WHAT WE'RE

02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:39.891
FACING RIGHT NOW I DATE AND AND

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:40.725
THE SERIOUSNESS OF LEAD --

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:41.793
POISONING THAT I THINK -- THIS

02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:44.128
IS A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO THE

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:47.065
TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM -- AND

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:48.233
AND ENSURE INVESTIGATION I WOULD

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:49.934
MAKE NOTE THAT -- AS YOU SAID

02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:51.636
IT'S IT'S REALLY AN ALLOCATION

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:53.771
OF THIS YEAR'S VIOLATION OF

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:54.072
COURSE HAS.

02:21:54.138 --> 02:21:54.906
TO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S AN

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:55.874
INVESTIGATION AND THE BUSINESS

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.408
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:21:57.475 --> 02:21:58.743
DEMONSTRATE ITS THERE AND

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.845
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHERE THE

02:22:00.912 --> 02:22:04.182
AT FAULT RIGHT AND AND SO.

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:05.183
SO WE CERTAINLY WE DO NOT WANT

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:06.217
TO PRESUME.

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:07.986
IT BUSINESSES IS CAUSING

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:09.287
SOMETHING BUT WE NEED TO FIND

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:11.022
WE'D HAVE A RESULT THAT SHOWS A

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:12.724
PROBLEM THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:13.825
INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY WHAT

02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:14.692
THE CAUSES.

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.227
AND THAT'S ALSO FOR THE SAFETY

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:18.329
AND HEALTH OF THAT WORKER AND

02:22:18.396 --> 02:22:19.964
ALSO THEIR FAMILY BY THE WAY I

02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:22.533
MEAN I'M A PEDIATRICIAN SO THERE

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:23.134
HAS THERE'S BLOOD LEVELS THAT

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.302
HIGH.

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:26.271
WHAT A BRING HOME FROM WORK
