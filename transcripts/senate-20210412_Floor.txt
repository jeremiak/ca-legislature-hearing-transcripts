SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACTUAL LEADING TO PROBATION SOONER WITHIN ARE YOU PREPARED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SEVENTY THREE WHICH WILL REPEAL MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR PEOPLE CONVICTED. OF CERTAIN NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES AND INSTEAD PROVIDE JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION TO EITHER SEND SOMEONE TO JAIL OR GROUND PROBATION ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THIS BILL IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD ENDING MASS INCARCERATION IN THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS WHICH HAS DEVASTATED CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS OUR STATE BUDGET. UNDER CURRENT LAW CALIFORNIA STILL CONTINUES TO PROHIBIT JUDGES FROM USING THEIR DISCRETION TO ORDER PROBATION IN CASES INVOLVING CERTAIN NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. WERE TYING THE HANDS OF THESE JUDGES AND REQUIRING THAT IN EVERY SINGLE CASE. VAN CARCERI THESE DEFENDANTS EVEN WHEN THE JUDGE BELIEVES THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES A PERSON WOULD BE BETTER REHABILITATED WITH SUPERVISED PROBATION IN THE COMMUNITY. NOTHING AND SB SEVENTY THREE LOWERS THE EXISTING UPPER PENALTIES FOR THESE OFFENSES. AND NOTHING INDUSTRY SEVENTY THREE PREVENTS THE JUDGE FROM SENDING SOMEONE TO JAIL IF THE JUDGE BELIEVES THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME. THIS BILL IS A MODERN ASSIDUOUS MEASURED AND MODEST AND COMMONSENSE SOLUTION TO HELP COURTS REDUCE MASS INCARCERATION SENTENCING WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING PUBLIC SAFETY. SB SEVENTY THREE ALLOWS JUDGES TO WEIGH THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEED THIS OR DEBATE ON THE ITEMS SENATOR NELSON.

SENATE BILL EIGHTY FIVE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BILL. SKINNER SKINNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO YOU- SB EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE REASON THAT I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT TO YOU IS. I THINK WE ALL. ARE VERY KEENLY AWARE OF HOW DRY THIS YEAR. IS ALREADY BEGUN. WHAT OUR SNOW PACK IS LIKE. THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALREADY HAVING HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD A WILDFIRE IN SACRAMENTO. AND OF COURSE THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN. EACH YEAR EXCESSIVELY WORST WILDFIRE SEASONS TO THE POINT THAT W HAVE CLOSE TO EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS A YEAR NOW THAT OUR WILDFIRE SEASON. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL OES IS IT IS OUR EARLY ACTION WILD FIRE PACKAGE TO HELP US MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCY. SO THE BILL IS A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION OF IT IS GENERAL FUND AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND IT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIRST GIVES ME TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION FOUR WILDLANDS. A HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION FOR WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION FOR COMMUNITY HARDENING TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR FORESTRY SECTOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS. AND THREE MILLION FOR SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT NOW MUCH OF THESE INDIVIDUAL CATEGORIES ARE GOING TO BE GRANTS TO ENTITIES LIKE LAND CONSERVANCIES AND THE VARIOUS PROTECTION FIRE COUNCILS IN ENTITIES THAT. ARE ENGAGED IN THE VEGETATION REDUCTION AND THE OTHER. THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED TO HELP US. CREATE BETTER RESILIENCY AND MORE- WITH WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT NOT FOR A WILDFIRE TO OCCUR BUT RATHER TO HELP US PREVENT THEM OR AT LEAST PREVENT THEIR QUICK SPREAD- ADDITIONALLY IT INCLUDES THE BILL THAT IS THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE WILDFIRE PART IT INCLUDES THREE POINT. THREE FIVE MILLION TO FIND A TECHNICAL. IN MY PROGRAM FOR SMALL MID SIZE AND UNDERS FOR AND CAL. AND IT AUTHORIZES ONE. FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS START. TO IN THE MURDER CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDE CARE FOR FOSTER YOUTH. IT ADDITIONALLY APPROPRIATE. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SUPPORT OUR STATE WIDE LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY PROGRAM FOR THIS SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN MAKES VARIOUS CLARIFYING AND TECHNICAL CHANGES AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU HE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU. MR PRESIDENT- AND SUGGEST WE SAW THIS BILL JUST A COUPLE HOURS AGO AND IN THE BUDGET I JUST WANT TO SHARE YOU KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN. ON TOURS. OUT TO THE FOREST WITH MYSELF AND- AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE DEVASTATION YOU'VE SEEN WAYS TO PREVENT- WILDFIRES FROM TRAVELING FAST IN WHAT WE CALL CROWN FIRES IN THE FOREST AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO THIN THE FOREST AND ALLOW THE FIRE TO COME DOWN. UNDER THE GROUND WORKERS WERE NATURALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN PRIOR TO ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION SO WE HAVE- CREATED THE PROBLEM ALONG WITH THE RISING TEMPERATURES IN THE SHORTNESS OF OUR SEASONS AND THE DIFFERENCE IN SNOW PACK. WE'VE SEEN THIS- THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS LIKE WE HAD LAST YEAR WE SAW. YOU KNOW FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES IN CALIFORNIA BURN SO I WANT TO JUST APPLAUD THE BUDGET COMMITTEES AT THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR MAKING THIS FIRST EARLY ACTION ITEM. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. GET THESE FUNDS THROUGH GRANTS TO- CONSERVANCY'S LIKE THIS YEAR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY TO OUR OUR CD'S TO OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- IT ALL OUT TO THE STATE IS NOT JUST A FOREST WHERE WE THINK OF TREES BURNING BUT IT'S ALSO. ALONG THE COASTLINES WHERE WE HAVE EDUCATION WE SAW- IN MALIBU WHERE WE SAW THE MUD SLIDES AFTER FIRE SO IT'S GETTING IN AND DOING THE RIGHT WORK EARLY ON- AND AS AS YOU. IT WAS NOTED EARLIER BY THE BUDGET CHAIR- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TO DROUGHT THERE'S THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND THIS YEAR AND THE QUICKER WE GET THIS MONEY THE GROUND. THE BETTER OFF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE. IN DEFENSE OF- THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON SO I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL RIGHT. SB EIGHTY FIVE. A SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. SENATE PRESIDENT LADIES ON THE SENATE FINALLY THE TIDE HAS TURNED. FOR MANY DECADES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE POLICY WAS INFORMED AS FAR AS FORCING WILDLANDS LEAVE IT ALONE. THE NEW LARGELY DID. AND THE RESULT. IT'S BEEN A GROWTH OF FUEL FILLER ENORMOUS. BUT NOW WITH THE GUN TO HAVE THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CATACLYSMIC FIRES. AS SUCH MAGNITUDE. LITTLE TOWN OF PARADISE COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE DIED. IN A FIRE IN NO SMALL MEASURE BECAUSE OF POLICIES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE DID NOT ALLOW. THE MANAGER OF THOSE FORESTS AND WILDLANDS. SOME OF THAT NEEDS REMOVING TREES REMOVING BRUSH. AND ENHANCING THE HABITAT ONE THING THAT NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT RELATED TO THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. IS ITS IMPACT ON WILDLIFE. PROTECTING THOSE WHO OF STOOD SO STRONGLY AGAINST DOING ANYTHING THAT ARE FORCED IN WILDLANDS. THEY SEEM TO DISREGARD ALL OF THE CRITTERS THE ANIMALS. THERE IN THE FOURTH. BANISHED FIGURE LITTLE BLOOD HERE BECAUSE THIS DEEP IN MY HEART TWO YEARS AGO I TOOK SOME OF US TO TOUR THE PARADISE. TALKED ABOUT HOW THE FIRE DEVASTATED THAT COMMUNITY. AND ONE OF THE BACK ROADS WE CAME UPON A LARGE BORE. THERE ARE MANY UP THERE IN THOSE HEELS. HE BEEN BARBECUED. BUT NOT ON THE SPENT ON THAT TERRIBLE FIRE. NOW THAT'S KIND OF A HORROR STRICKEN THAT LOOK AT SUCH DEVASTATION OF AN ANIMAL. BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. TO OUR WILDLIFE AND THEN OUR FISH AS A DEVASTATED SOILS. A ROAD INTO OUR RIVERS AND OUR STREAMS. THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE STEP FORWARD. A VERY SIGNIFICANT STEP FOR MORE SAFE AND SANE FUTURE. AND IT'S GOING TO HELP URBAN AREAS TO URBAN LEGISLATORS MUCH DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS OVER THE DECADES EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AFFECTED. BUT NOW THEY ARE THESE FIRES HAVE BEEN CROUCHED ON OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES MARCHING RIGHT INTO THEM. ONE THAT I USED TO REPRESENT AND- SANTA ROSA. NEVER HAD FIRES LIKE THIS RIDE INTO TOWN. GOT A FIRE IN RED BLUFF RIGHT TO VERY NEAR WHERE WE LIVE. INTOWN IT IS TIME. AND I SALUTE THE TIME. AND I SALUTE TO CHANGE AND WE WILL BE BETTER IF WE ARE SAFER FROM THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE FOR SOME WHILE LANCE AND THEY WILL OUR LANDS AND OUR ANIMALS AND OUR HUMANS. AND OUR HABITAT IN OUR RESOURCES. WILL BE MORE PRODUCTIVE. AND MORE HEALTHY AND MORE SAFE. THANK YOU CENTER ALERT. MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HE DOES SENATOR- FROM READING IS SAID TO HIM THAT IS CORRECT. OF BECAUSE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS FIRE SUPPRESSION HAS BEEN THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN OUR STATE OF PEOPLE URBAN AND RURAL OF ALL PARTIES EVERYONE THAT WAS THE OPERATING THEORY. AND IT HAS BUTTED UP AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE THE OTHER PART OF THE PARADISE STORY IS THE FACT THAT THAT FAR REMOVED AT SIXTY ACRES A MINUTE SIXTY ACRES A MINUTE. PEOPLE COULD NOT OUTRUN THAT FIRE AND I WAS THERE THREE DAYS AND SIX DAYS IN NINE DAYS AFTER THAT FIRE I SAW. THE DEMONSTRATION AND THE SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IS THIS DOES EVERYTHING TAKES THE FIRST STEPS OF EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO. OUR WHETHER IT'S HEARTENING OF BUILDINGS. WHETHER IT'S A PRESCRIBED FIRE WEATHER RICH FUELS MANAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S RECOVERING- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER IT'S WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO FIGHT THE FIRE. BECAUSE LAST AUGUST WELL ALL OF YOU WERE HERE STRUGGLING WITH THE END OF SESSION. I WAS AT HOME WITH A FIRE THAT BROKE OUT IN MY AREA THAT BURNED WITHIN TWO MILES OF MY HOUSE. IN A COASTAL USUALLY FOGGY SEASIDE CITY WHERE THE RESOURCES WERE SO STRESSED IN THE STRAIGHT IN THE STATE THAT THAT FIRE WAS BURNING THROUGH RURAL RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON FOUGHT FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS. IT GOT TO WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE CITY LIMITS AND WE JUST HAD THE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT AT THE CITY LIMITS ONE BIG WIND AND IT WAS IN. A IN SO THE BIG QUESTION TO IS ONE THAT IS ADDRESSED BY THIS BOND IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES SO WE ARE NOT STRETCHED THAT WAY AGAIN. AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OFF. THIS IS THE NEWER NEWER NORMAL AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO FUELS MANAGEMENT AND FORCE TREATMENT AND BUILDING HARDENING AND HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. TO DEAL WITH THE FIRE INSURANCE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED MANY OF RETURN HOME TO FOUND FIND CANCELLATION NOTICES FOR THEIR FIRE INSURANCE IN THE MAIL AFTER BEING OUT OF THEIR HOUSE FOR TWELVE DAYS. SO THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO BE READY TO DO THIS REGULARLY AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO I STRONGLY URGE AND I'VE FOUGHT AND THANK EVERYBODY THAT. WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I'M PRICE IN SUPPORT OF THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION RESILIENCY EARLY ACTION BUDGET PLAN. THIS UNPRECEDENTED EARLY DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES WILL PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND AS WE HEARD IT'S NO LONGER JUST THE FOREST THIS WILL HELP MINIMIZE THE LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. WHILE INVESTING IN FOREST HEALTH WATERSHED PROTECTION AND OTHER VITAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION PROJECTS. THIS EARLY INVESTMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL HELP PREPARE US. FOR ANOTHER DEVASTATING WILDFIRE SEASON WE KNOW THAT THE SEASONS ARE GETTING LONGER. AND MORE DEVASTATING AND WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THEM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HOME. I WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM FOR HER LEADERSHIP THE GREAT SENATOR FROM HILLS BURKE FOR COACH SHARING THE WATER WORKING GROUP WITH ME. ALL THE GREAT SENATOR FROM BERKELEY AND FREMONT FOR THEIR COLLABORATION AND EVERYONE ELSE FOR THEIR INPUT. THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PACKAGE. THAT WILL PUT SEVENTY THREE MILLION AND KALIFORNIA FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. WILL LSO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LANDOWNERS CLEARING BRUSH FOR CONDUCTING OTHER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS IN ADDITION ANOTHER SIXTY MILLION. WILL GOING GRANTS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND AGAIN ALL THIS EARLY INVESTMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AS CHAIR OF THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PLAN WILL HELP STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS GET ADEQUATE INSURANCE THEY'RE STRUGGLING. BECAUSE IT'S GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WOULD CONTINUE TO BEST INVESTMENTS WE CAN CREATE RESILIENT HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. FINALLY THE BUDGET ACTION WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO CONSERVANCIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU AND I URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. COLLEGES THERE'S A LOT TO ADD ON TO WHAT. HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED BUT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY FIVE. IT IS MY HONOR TO REPRESENT SENATE DISTRICT EIGHT IN SOME OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW. THAT I HAVE ONE OF THOSE VERY VERY LARGE GEOGRAPHICALLY SENATE DISTRICTS INCLUDING ALL OR PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES. ELEVEN FROM THE BASIN IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS. THE CREEK FIRE THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. HAPPEN IN MY TERRITORY IN THE FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTIES. THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. WERE DESTROYED. NOT TO MENTION LIVES PROPERTY PROSPECTS. I THINK THIS FIRE HAS SHOWCASED THE VULNERABILITIES THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS WHETHER IT BE IN. PROPER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PUBLIC SAFETYOUR INVESTMENT THE OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE OF HOW THE CITY CALIFORNIA CAN DEAL WITH SUCH COMPLEX IN DEMANDING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES NO I KNOW THAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES EARLIER TALK ABOUT HOW MAYBE THE TIDE HAS TURNED. THAT WE HAVE SPENT SO MANY YEARS. INVESTING IN- IN IN MAKING OF POLITICAL INSIGHTS INTO CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT WE HAVE NOT NECESSARILY APPRECIATED ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL RIGHT NOW TO CONTEMPLATE. PROPER FOREST MANAGEMENT SKILLS- BREAKS ARE HARDENING AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT SB EIGHTY FIVE DOES IT'S A POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IS IT PERFECT NOW I DON'T THINK IT IS BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU IT IS A DEFINITE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE THESE THIS TYPE OF CAPITAL ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS. BEING INVESTED INTO HARDENING. TO FIRE BREAKS- INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES ALL THESE THINGS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE LAST RIDAY GOVERNOR NEWSOM CAME TO FRESNO. AND HE HIGHLIGHTED SB EIGHTY FIVE IN ALL THE CONTENTS OF THE BUDGET PROVISIONS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW EVERYONE CAN CAN TAKE DIFFERENT SIDES OR ANGLES ON THIS ISSUE BUT NOBODY CAN DISAGREE THIS IS NOT A PRIORITY. AND I WANT TO COMMEND GOVERNOR NEWSOM FROM COMING TO FRESNO- TO DO IT TOO- VISITING THE IMPACTED AREAS- AT TIMES PRIOR SO HE HAS FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN A MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN DEVASTATED. AND PROPERTIESHAVE TO BE REBUILT NOT KNOWING IF THAT'S POSSIBLE OR EVEN IF IT IF INSURANCE MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. WE KNOW THE CLIMATE IN THE ECOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING. SO MUCH SO THAT MANY OF US ARE ARE YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY ON WATER WE'RE IN THOSE TYPE OF DIRE STRAITS. AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE ECOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING THAT WE HAVE A COMMENSURATE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM SO WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I WILL BE SUPPORTING S. B. EIGHTY FIVE M. I'M PROUD THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU SENATOR DOT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT BOB LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I WANT TO BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THIS EARLY ACTION A WILDFIRE BUDGET FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE BUT ENTIRE BUDGET TEAM FOR THE GREAT JOB THAT THEY DID ON THIS IN PARTICULAR LIKE TO COMMEND THE SENATORS FROM BALDWIN PARK IN HEALDSBURG- WHO LED THE SENATE WHILE FORMER. NO THREE. TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE PROPOSAL BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT IS LARGELY REFLECTED IN THE PACKAGE WE ARE TO VOTE ON. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT OUR CHAIR BUDGET SUB TO FOR HIS SUBCOMMITTEE SWIFT ACTION TO APPROVE THAT PACKAGE. BY ALL ACCOUNTS WE ARE FACING A DANGEROUS FIRE SEASON THE LARA PROLONGED FIRE- SEASON DRY WEATHER. QUICK ACTION IS THE MANAGE IN TREAT THE VEGETATION THERE ARE HIGHEST WILDFIRE THREATS OWNS INCLUDING PRESCRIBED BURNING IT TO PROVIDE DEFENSIVE SPACE AND FUEL BREAKS. IN CRITICAL AREAS. ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION IT FOR SELF GRANTS. ARE COUNTIES IN FAR WISE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TO READY PROJECTS THAT WILL PROTECT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET THE RESOURCES INTO THEIR HEADS EARLY WITHOUT DELAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A YES VOTE ON S. B. EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN THROUGH- OVER TEN WILDFIRES IN. MY DISTRICT SINCE COMING INTO OFFICE AND WHEN I FIRST TOOK OFFICE- A WILDFIRE THAT TOOK UP MY WHOLE HOME TOWN INCLUDING MY HOME KNOWING WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE A VICTIM A WILDFIRE- I WOULD APPRECIATE WHAT. ARE SENATE BUDGET SUB HERE IS DONE BY PUSHING THE ENVELOPE HERE ARE CHAIRS THE WILDFIRE WORKING GROUP THE GOVERNOR. FOR SHOWING UP AND- STEPPING THROUGH THOSE ASHES WITH US WHEN WE LOST EVERYTHING. THIS IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND I WANT TO BUILD ON- MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO'S REMARKS ABOUT BEING. COMMENSURATE WITH THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE WE HEARD TESTIMONY EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE LIABILITY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVING. DIRECTLY IN THE WILD FIRE ZONES COULD BE OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S WITH A T. TODAY WERE PASSING A MEASURE THAT WILL PUT FORWARD ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS AND IS THE PRO TEM IS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON THESE EFFORTS WE SAVE SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS ON THE BACK AND- SO WITH THIS ACT TODAY I THINK WE'LL BE SAVING. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH IS A HUGE HUGE COST SAVINGS NOT JUST FINANCIALLY BUT FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES. BUT I WANT TO I WANT TO STATE TO YOU ALL THAT THIS IS GOING TO. CAN CAN YOU TO REQUIRE SUSTAINED INVESTMENT AT A SCALE THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN QUITE IMAGINE AT THIS POINT- A TRILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY NOT JUST FOR HOMEOWNERS LIVING. IN CANYONS AND HILLSIDES IN RURAL AREAS THAT THAT YOU MAY NOT REPRESENT. BUT THE WILDFIRE SMOKE IN THE IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS ON PREMATURE BIRTHS ON SEVERE ASTHMA. ON EXTREME RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AND EVEN NOW ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY BY STANFORD LAST MONTH. THE WILD FIRES WE HAD LAST WINTER WILL PERMANENTLY AFFECT THE GENETICS OF NEWBORN BABIES BORN EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT WAS EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE SMOKE THE MOST TOXIC SORT. SO THIS IS NOT JUST A WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE ISSUE THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS WHY THIS MEASURE I BELIEVE IS SO IMPORTANT HERE TODAY- BUT IT IS JUST THE FIRST STEP TRULY. THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE FOR HOME HARDENING WILL COVER ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND HOMES THAT'S LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL PROBLEM. SO WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US HERE BUT- WE'RE STARTING TO HONE IN ON THE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE NOW REALIZED THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUE WILDFIRE THREATS. THAT AREN'T CROWN FIRES OR FUEL DRIVEN FIRES BUT WIND DRIVEN FIRES WERE ONE SPARK CAN BURN A HOLE COMMUNITY DOWN. IT IT'S ABOUT VENTS AND EVEN GASKET IN THE SIMPLE SMALL THINGS CALLING OUT THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY IN THESE OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL ENTITIES I THINK WILL BE THE FUTURE OF FIRE PREVENTION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT REASON I STAND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WHY CULTURALLY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TOO WOULD URGE- THIS BODY TO AGREE A CONCUR IN THE AMENDMENT CITY ASSEMBLY HAS TAKEN TO. THE WILDFIRE- PACKAGE THIS MEASURE IN FRONT OF US. PARALLELS SIR REFLECT ALIGNS WITH THE ACTION WAS TAKEN AND- THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE- BACK IN AROUND VALENTINE'S DAY WHERE WE HAD FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PUT FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION BECAUSE IT REFLECTS. THE VALUES THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY HAVE BEEN- TALKING ABOUT ADVOCATING FOR TO DEAL WITH MORE- NOT ONLY CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCY EFFORTS THAT WAS. A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WHAT THE WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD HAD SET OUT SO I LISTEN TO THEM MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN AND IT'S GRATIFYING. THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS INITIAL STEP RIGHT NOW EARLY ACTION BECAUSE THE BUDGET BUDGET YEAR IS GOING TO INCLUDE OTHERS SPENDING PROPOSALS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BACKPACK IS BEFORE YOU I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON IT. IS THAT THERE IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE A TAKEN FOR NEW FIRE CREWS TO SIXTEEN FIRE CREWS THE ADMINISTRATION FOUND THE MONEY IN THE REGULAR BUDGET AND THOSE. FOLKS ARE ALREADY BEING HIRED WORK IS GOING ON IN THE IN THE PREVENTION FIELD SO THAT'S THERE. I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE HERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT COOLING CENTERS BECAUSE YOU'RE- A COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HIT. WHEN THE FIRES TO OCCUR OCCUR AND THAT'S MORE APPROPRIATELY IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND- AND AT WHICH WILL BE PART OF THE REGULAR- BUDGET. D. AS MY COLLEAGUES FROM THOUSAND OAKS IS NOT ONLY. CELEBRATING HIS BIRTHDAY- BUT HIGHLIGHTED THAT THIS IS MULTI DIMENSIONAL APPROACH THAT- THIS ACTION TAKES WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT WILD PLANTS YES WE HAVE FOR US BUT WE ALSO HAVE CHAPARRAL WE ALSO HAVE. WOODLANDS THAT WE'RE DOING AND- AS MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THIS IS REALLY AN INVESTMENT BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY THERE IS LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY HERE FOR. FIRE SAFE COUNCILS FOR COUNTIES FOR THE- BAND BAND GRANT PROGRAMS AT THE CAL FIRE WILL- WILL PUT OUT. IT COVERS A MULTIPLE OF SCALES ALSO WERE. ISSUED AS WE TALK ABOUT. THE GUY ORIGINAL HAD. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HEALTHY FOREST PROGRAMS AND WE'VE UP THAT BY A HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT IS ALL AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL- OF FOLKS TO DO PRESCRIBED BURNS TO DO FUEL TREATMENT REDUCTIONS TO DO. REFORESTED IS ASIAN TO BIOMASS- IT'S A TEMPLATE. BUT AS WE'VE HEARD. WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE SPENDING. TWICE AS MUCH MONEY THAN THIS ON A YEARLY BASIS ON PREVENTION WERE OUR BUDGET FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN ABOUT TWO POINT TWO BILLION AND SUPPRESSION AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN THE FIRE STARPOINT WE- AS A BUDGETEERS INDICATE ONE DOLLAR INVENSYS INVENTED IN PREVENTION. IS WORTH- SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS- ECONOMICALLY FOR THE FOR THAT SO- I ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO SHARE WITH THEIR LOCAL- OUR COUNCIL'S FIRE COUNCILS IN- THE- COUNTY SUPERVISORS THESE ARE. LARGE LANDSCAPES PROJECTS DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL HOME HARDENING IS A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY AND IT PROVIDES A TEMPLATE FOR PROGRAMS THAT- WE LOOK FOR TO FUNDING IN THE FUTURE I WILL POINT OUT ONE OF THE SENATE PRIORITIES- WHAT IS THE- THE FACT CONSERVANCIES THAT WILL PUT MONEY DIRECTLY IN THE HANDS OF THE CONSERVANCY SET WORK WITH PARTNERS WITH CAL FIRE THE SANTA MONICA. MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY SAN DIEGO RIVER CONSERVANCY A STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY IN CAN'T SAN GABRIEL AND LOWER LOS ANGELES CONSERVANCY I APPRECIATE ALL THE INPUT FROM THE WORKING. GROUP ON THIS MATTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE. FUNDED AND FINALLY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE UP FROM THE EIGHTH SENATE DISTRICT THE SIERRA. NEVADA CONSERVANCY HAS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT ARE READY AND THIS THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT IS SIMPLY A DOWN PAYMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY PROJECTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE THAT. THE LEADER- OR ONE OF THE LEADERS IN IN THE STATE AS FAR SHOWING US HOW WE CAN TREAT THE FORESTS AND CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE TO MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT AND ENJOYABLE FOR ALL- CALIFORNIANS IN WITH THAT.

IT FOR A LOT OF REASONS BUT I WAS JUST A FEW MILES AWAY WHEN THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE I WAS TAKING MY DAUGHTER TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BUT- AS WE ARE RECOVERING FROM COLD AND WE ARE FACING A NEW EPIDEMIC OF MASS SHOOTINGS AND QUIETLY LAST YEAR IT WAS THE DEADLIEST. GUN VIOLENCE YEAR IN DECADES. BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT GUN VIOLENCE CREEP OUT OF HOUSEHOLDS. OUT OF DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND INTO THE PUBLIC SPHERE AGAIN AS WE OPEN UP. AND WE ARE ONCE AGAIN PUT IN A POSITION WHERE ANYONE OF US AT ANY TIME CAN BE SEEN. HAS TO WORRY ABOUT BEING A VICTIM OF. GUN VIOLENCE FOR ANY REASON. THE UNITED STATES HAS A GUN VIOLENCE HOMICIDE RATE THAT IS TWENTY FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER FIRST WILL COUNTRY. WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS AS NORMAL WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO WE MUST AS ELECTED OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO WORK TO TRY TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO HONOR THESE VICTIMS.
