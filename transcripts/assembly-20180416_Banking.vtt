INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHICH

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.273 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS OVER ONE HUNDRED

00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:29.174 region:rollup2
CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES

00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:31.242 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:34.145 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE NATIONAL ONES

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:35.213 region:rollup2
EXPERIAN EQUIFAX AND TRANSUNION.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.548 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT PROVISIONS OF THIS

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:37.582 region:rollup2
BILL THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE

00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:39.384 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO PLACE A SECURITY

00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:41.119 region:rollup2
FREEZE ELECTRONICALLY. WE ALSO

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:43.121 region:rollup2
SUPPORT ELIMINATION OF ANY FEES

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:44.756 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE FREEZES.

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.291 region:rollup2
WE ALSO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF

00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:47.458 region:rollup2
THE FREEZE THAT SHOULD BE LIFTED

00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:48.259 region:rollup2
WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THAT

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THE PROVISION SHOULD

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:51.930 region:rollup2
BE INCLUDED UP FOR ACTS OF GOD

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.497 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES ARE COULD BE A CRISIS

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.898 region:rollup2
WHERE DATA CENTER COULD BE

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:55.667 region:rollup2
CLOSED DOWN. AND THAT

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:57.402 region:rollup2
INFORMATION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.636 region:rollup2
WITH THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES.

00:38:57.402 --> 00:39:00.238 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT IN PLACE

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:01.940 region:rollup2
IN OF THE INITIAL FREEZE WE'D

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:03.975 region:rollup2
LIKE TO HAVE A MAXIMUM THREE

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.009 region:rollup2
DAYS TO PLACE INITIAL FOR HOUSE.

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:06.811 region:rollup2
THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.712 region:rollup2
AUTHENTICATE THE PERSON AN

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:09.681 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WHEN THEY SUPPLIED

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.515 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION TO US.

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:11.983 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT WE

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:13.551 region:rollup2
RECEIVE INFORMATION WHERE WE MAY

00:39:11.983 --> 00:39:14.852 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION WE

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:16.521 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE A PARTIAL TELEPHONE

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:18.489 region:rollup2
NUMBER PARTIAL NAME. PARTIAL

00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:20.325 region:rollup2
ADDRESS AND UNDER THE PROVISIONS

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:22.493 region:rollup2
OF THIS LAW WE WOULD STILL HAVE

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:23.728 region:rollup2
TO PLACE THAT INITIAL FREEZE.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.529 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:26.631 region:rollup2
COULD LEAD TO SOME FRAUDULENT

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:27.699 region:rollup2
CONTACT.

00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:29.968 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO HAVE

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:31.169 region:rollup2
OBJECTION TO TO THE PARTS OF THE

00:39:29.968 --> 00:39:32.203 region:rollup2
BILL ABOUT REPORTING THE

00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:34.072 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TOGETHER CREDIT

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:35.573 region:rollup2
BUREAUS.

00:39:34.072 --> 00:39:36.741 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO SYSTEM

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.675 region:rollup2
EXISTS FOR SHARING THAT

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:39.377 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AMONG ALL THREE

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:40.979 region:rollup2
CREDIT BUREAUS.

00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:42.213 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE NATIONAL CREDIT

00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.781 region:rollup2
REPORTING AGENCIES ARE

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.949 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT IN THE.

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:47.819 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES WHO

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:48.620 region:rollup2
HAVE DIVERSE DATABASE PLATFORMS.

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:49.921 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.289 region:rollup2
COMPLEX WHEN INTEGRATED TAKES

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:52.991 region:rollup2
PLACE ACROSS CREDIT REPORTING

00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:54.826 region:rollup2
AGENCIES BECAUSE EACH AGENCIES

00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:56.527 region:rollup2
HAS ITS OWN STANDARDS REGARDING

00:39:54.826 --> 00:39:57.729 region:rollup2
DATA COLLECTION AND DESIGN.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:59.197 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE HAVE SEEN OVER TIME

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:00.398 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITY OF HAVING

00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:02.100 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES SHARE

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:03.401 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.769 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.170 region:rollup2
PASSABLY THE PAST THE SENATE AND

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.206 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY AT HAVE STRUGGLED TO

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.241 region:rollup2
TRY TO BUILD A UNIFORM SYSTEM

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:12.076 region:rollup2
AMONG BOTH HOUSES.

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.444 region:rollup2
ALSO AND JUST AS IMPORTANT EACH

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:14.846 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY WILL

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:16.147 region:rollup2
WANT TO VERIFY THE CONSUMERS

00:40:14.846 --> 00:40:17.615 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON THEIR. OWN

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:19.284 region:rollup2
DATABASES

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:21.586 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY AND THE

00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:23.187 region:rollup2
OTHER CREDIT BUREAUS.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:25.290 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY.

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:27.892 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW WE HAVE TO SEND A

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.426 region:rollup2
PASSWORD OR A PIN NUMBER TO EACH

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:30.028 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSUMER TO PLACE A

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.562 region:rollup2
FREEZE.

00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:33.164 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF A FREEZE THIS PLACE

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:34.032 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WITH EXPERIENCE WANT

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.900 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION IF WAS SENT

00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:37.502 region:rollup2
OVER TRAINED UNION WE WOULD HAVE

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.736 region:rollup2
TO CONTACT THE CONSUMER. AND

00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:40.939 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM A SPECIAL PIN NUMBER

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:42.340 region:rollup2
AND A PASSWORD IT WOULD HAVE TO

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:43.408 region:rollup2
VERIFY THEIR INFORMATION AGAIN.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.243 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHERE WE SEE SOME

00:40:43.408 --> 00:40:48.379 region:rollup2
TROUBLING PROVISIONS HERE.

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:50.114 region:rollup2
ALSO AND AND LASTLY WHAT THIS

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.883 region:rollup2
PROVISION ALSO REACHED TO IS

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:53.318 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD GO FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:57.588 region:rollup2
CAR DEALERSHIP SAYS WELL WE USE

EXPERIENCE FOR CREDIT REPORT.

00:40:57.588 --> 00:41:00.591 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS LAW YOU COULD CALL

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.959 region:rollup2
TRAINED UNION AND REQUIRE THEM

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.261 region:rollup2
TO CALL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE THEM

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.895 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:05.930 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC FREEZE FOR THAT

00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:07.165 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.834 region:rollup2

ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE AND HAVING

THAT REALLY STUCK STRUCK ME AND

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.666 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:43.768 region:rollup2

WORK OUT.

00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:51.008 region:rollup2
A LITTLE MORE BUT ALSO I THINK

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:52.510 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BETTER DEFINE THE

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
RECEIVING OF THE REQUEST

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.813 region:rollup2

REALLY MAKE A SIGNIFICANT

00:42:05.056 --> 00:42:08.526 region:rollup2

00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.821 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG JUMP

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:25.355 region:rollup2
THERE SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:26.456 region:rollup2
TO THAT DB OWES ENFORCEMENT

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IS SUBJECT TO

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:29.593 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:31.528 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACTS.

00:55:29.593 --> 00:55:32.896 region:rollup2
SO HEARINGS ARE PRESIDED OVER BY

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:34.565 region:rollup2
AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:35.799 region:rollup2
A KEY AND AN ACCUSED PERSON HAS

00:55:34.565 --> 00:55:37.701 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ANY DECISION

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:39.036 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST ARBITRARY THERE

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:40.771 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A LOT JUDGE INVOLVED.

00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:42.272 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:43.540 region:rollup2
SO.

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:45.275 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL BERMAN RIGHT AYE AYE

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.843 region:rollup2
AYE THAT'S GOOD I'M GLAD TO HEAR

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.511 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:49.112 region:rollup2
BUT I AM ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:51.815 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE REFERENCING OTHER

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:53.250 region:rollup2
BILLS HERE AND THE LAW.

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:54.218 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS YOU KNOW

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.886 region:rollup2
STIPULATES METHODOLOGIES WE

00:55:54.218 --> 00:55:56.920 region:rollup2
DON'T HEAR.

00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:57.187 region:rollup2
IT'S SET YOU NINE THE COMMITTEE

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.689 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.756 region:rollup2
.

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:01.291 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:01.859 region:rollup2
BIGGEST TALKING POINT THAT I

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:04.094 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH THIS. I MEAN IT'S

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:06.196 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:08.565 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF.

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:09.166 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T DOT AND I ACROSS CITY

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.267 region:rollup2
WE COULD END UP I'M NOT SAYING

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:11.468 region:rollup2
WE WILL.

00:56:10.267 --> 00:56:13.637 region:rollup2
BUT WE COULD END UP WITH THIS

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:14.872 region:rollup2
TWENTY POUNDS ARE FINE IF THE BO

00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:16.006 region:rollup2
JOE'S TO DO THAT IS THE BE ALL

00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:18.108 region:rollup2
HERE TO.

00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:19.810 region:rollup2
NO DVRS NOT HERE BUT THE BILL

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:21.044 region:rollup2
ALSO REQUIRES THE DDO BASED THE

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:23.013 region:rollup2
PENALTY ON THE AMOUNT OF.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:25.182 region:rollup2
GRAVITY OF THE VIOLATION THE

00:56:23.013 --> 00:56:25.849 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF A PERSON'S PREVIOUS

00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:27.618 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS AND WHETHER THE

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:28.986 region:rollup2
PERSON'S ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT

00:56:27.618 --> 00:56:31.188 region:rollup2
WILL FOR OUR KNOWING SO THERE

00:56:28.986 --> 00:56:32.923 region:rollup2
ARE SOME METRICS. ON AND THOSE

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:35.425 region:rollup2
METRICS COMBINED WITH EXISTING

00:56:32.923 --> 00:56:37.995 region:rollup2

00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:42.299 region:rollup2
BE.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:44.101 region:rollup2
OKAY DO YOU HAVE. ABOUT WHERE

IT'S INDIAN OUNCES BUT ALSO

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.707 region:rollup2
THOSE I'M ESTIMATES THAT THEM

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:54.544 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:56.647 region:rollup2
BILL ITSELF. IT IS ON PAGE NINE.

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.181 region:rollup2
AND IT IS LINE EIGHTEEN TWENTY

00:56:56.647 --> 00:56:59.683 region:rollup2
TWENTY AT TWENTY TWO SEVENTY ONE

00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:01.118 region:rollup2
THREE POINT ONE YOU'RE READY FOR

OKAY AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LOOK

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:06.523 region:rollup2

GREAT WELL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:11.695 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC PLAYOFF AT THIS

00:57:10.327 --> 00:57:13.330 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR POINT BUT BUT THANK

00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:15.332 region:rollup2
YOU FOR YOU KNOW COGENT ANSWERS

THINK DIFFERENTLY

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:19.836 region:rollup2
AND LIKE.

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:22.205 region:rollup2
BUT ANYWAY.

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:24.274 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT HERE ARE. THE.

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:26.076 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN ON THE MOON SO REPLY

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:28.612 region:rollup2
TO OPPOSITION A STATEMENT MY

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:28.812 region:rollup2
LOGO.

00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:30.347 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.882 region:rollup2
.

00:57:30.347 --> 00:57:32.816 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY WE

00:57:31.882 --> 00:57:33.650 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE A LJ.

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:35.619 region:rollup2
.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:37.087 region:rollup2
PROVISION.

00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:38.822 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM BEING IS TO

00:57:37.087 --> 00:57:41.959 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THIS ESPECIALLY FOR A

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:42.726 region:rollup2
SMALL CFL COULD EXCEED THE VALUE

00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:44.494 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:57:42.726 --> 00:57:46.897 region:rollup2
PENALTIES THEMSELVES.

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:49.966 region:rollup2
MORE TO THE POINT. WHEN A

00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:51.068 region:rollup2
PENALTY OR VIOLATION OCCURS.

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:52.836 region:rollup2
IF YOU MAKE A VIOLATION FOR

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:54.604 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ON THE PAPERWORK

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:57.274 region:rollup2
ODDS ARE THAT VIOLATION WILL

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:59.609 region:rollup2
OCCUR ON EVERY SINGLE.

00:57:57.274 --> 00:58:01.545 region:rollup2
LONG SO YOU COULD HAVE HUNDREDS

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:03.246 region:rollup2
OF VIOLATIONS SO WELL EVEN IF

00:58:01.545 --> 00:58:05.382 region:rollup2
THERE INADVERTENT ERRORS.

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:07.084 region:rollup2
SO WILL DB OUR COULD DPO USE

00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:08.719 region:rollup2
THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO RATCHET UP

00:58:07.084 --> 00:58:10.821 region:rollup2
THE PENALTIES SAYING THERE'S A

00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:12.356 region:rollup2
HISTORY OUR PATTERN WHEN IN FACT

00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:14.491 region:rollup2
THE VIOLATION WAS A RECURRING

00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:15.425 region:rollup2
VIOLATION. THAT WAS INADVERTENT

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.494 region:rollup2
IN NATURE

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:18.762 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO THE EXTENT OF THE LAW

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.097 region:rollup2
WAS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER WHAT'S

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:23.233 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INADVERTENT ERRORS MAY

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:24.501 region:rollup2
BE. YOU KNOW FIND X. Y. Z. THAT

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:28.872 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY AND

00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:30.374 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING.

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:32.876 region:rollup2
I I THINK I'VE GONE THROUGH THE

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:34.778 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ANNA AND SO I MEAN YEAH

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:36.179 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME OF

00:58:34.778 --> 00:58:38.448 region:rollup2
THE METHODOLOGY THAT THAT IN

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.982 region:rollup2
PLACE AND ON ITS CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:39.983 region:rollup2
OTHER LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:42.052 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:43.387 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE THE INTENT IS NOT

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:46.156 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEAN WE DON'T WANT.

00:58:43.387 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
I ANY OF THESE AGENCIES IT TO.

00:58:46.156 --> 00:58:49.726 region:rollup2
US BE IN VIOLATION UP BUT THE

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.161 region:rollup2
INTENT IS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:52.129 region:rollup2
GOING FROM TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY

00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:53.730 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND IS THAT IT'S

00:58:52.129 --> 00:58:55.932 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL ENOUGH SO THERE WILL

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.200 region:rollup2
BE AN INTERESTS NOT TO VIOLATE.

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:59.669 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED I THINK YOU JUST

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.138 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:02.739 region:rollup2
AND IF IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH AN

00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:04.975 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE I'M SO

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:06.943 region:rollup2
THE HOPE IS THAT DB ó CAN HELP.

00:59:04.975 --> 00:59:07.911 region:rollup2
ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:09.980 region:rollup2
IT EVER GETS TO THE POINT OF A

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:12.249 region:rollup2
VIOLATION THIS IS IF THERE IS

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:14.251 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THERE IS HISTORY OF A

00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:15.719 region:rollup2
VIOLATION THEN THIS IS WHERE

00:59:14.251 --> 00:59:16.920 region:rollup2
THIS COMES IN. I'M AND I THINK

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.921 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.956 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT IS OUR

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.257 region:rollup2
HOPE AND THAT THERE ARE

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:20.857 region:rollup2
EVALUATION.

00:59:20.257 --> 00:59:22.459 region:rollup2
IT

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:23.493 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE INTO ANY

00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:24.528 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS I THINK IT'S A HOPE

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:26.063 region:rollup2
OF DB ó THAT THERE ARE

00:59:24.528 --> 00:59:27.864 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS AS WELL.

00:59:26.063 --> 00:59:29.599 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY FEELING IS THAT I

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:31.368 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A PLAN FOR THAT

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:33.236 region:rollup2
INCREASES SUCH AS THE TWO SEVERE

00:59:31.368 --> 00:59:34.871 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:36.640 region:rollup2
UP POSITIONS ARE AWESOME POINT

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:37.707 region:rollup2
OF VIEW SO THAT WOULD BE MORE

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.442 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:40.811 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:38.442 --> 00:59:43.447 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ANY CASES?

00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:45.115 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BEHIND THAT DISAPPEAR

00:59:43.447 --> 00:59:48.985 region:rollup2
ALL WHOM Y..

00:59:45.115 --> 00:59:50.654 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH DRASTIC INCREASE. IN

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:52.823 region:rollup2
ALL I'M I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:54.624 region:rollup2
COMPARED THE AMOUNT THAT THAT

00:59:52.823 --> 00:59:56.359 region:rollup2
THE YOU ARE. INFORMED THREE FIVE

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:59.729 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN

00:59:56.359 --> 01:00:02.099 region:rollup2
AYE I TRY TO NOT IN SO JASTA. A

VIOLATING DROPPING. SOME HAS OF

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:11.875 region:rollup2
THOSE MATERIALS ON THE FREEWAY I

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.610 region:rollup2
RAN INTO A LOT OF WELL NOW

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION SO BUT THE HERE IS

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:18.381 region:rollup2
SUCH A STIR. IN A TEN FOR THE

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:20.150 region:rollup2
INCREASES TO IT CAN BE.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:23.420 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL AND TO CBO ON

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:26.156 region:rollup2

THE PDF FILE ARROWS TO UP

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:30.160 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF THAT'S WHY IF YOU

CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT. THE

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:37.334 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION OPPOSITION SO NO SIDE

SET UP. THERE THERE IS AN APPEAL

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.471 region:rollup2
IN PLACE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:44.641 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT THE MARKET HAS

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:46.343 region:rollup2
pIS MUCH BIGGER. A AND I AS I

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:06.996 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:07.864 region:rollup2

ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THEY'RE VERY

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:14.804 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO REPAY. AND THEY CAN

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.405 region:rollup2
PUT PEOPLE INTO INCREDIBLE

WE THINK THAT IT IS A GOOD. RIDE

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:48.304 region:rollup2
NARROWLY TAILORED SOLUTION TO

NORMALIZE OF THE EXISTING.

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:53.409 region:rollup2

BREATH IN THE MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:59.048 region:rollup2
A GREAT REFORM OF OF OF THE

CONSUMER ACCESS.

PRESENTED HERE TODAY AS WELL AS

01:13:09.352 --> 01:13:12.121 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS. WE

ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED THIS I WAS

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.724 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THERE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:16.325 region:rollup2
AND TWO AND THREE WHEN WE WERE

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:18.127 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING AT WHEN WE MOVED A

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:20.529 region:rollup2

MYSELF AND OTHERS ACTUALLY

NEGOTIATED WITH CONSUMERS UNION

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.168 region:rollup2
AND THEY SUPPORTED. OF THE BILL

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:28.004 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME IT WAS UNDERSTOOD

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:30.006 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS NOT ONE LOAN PER

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:32.708 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WAS ONE LONE RESTRICTED

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:33.576 region:rollup2
PER PER LENDER AND BORROWER. SO

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.244 region:rollup2
UP AND THAT'S BEEN THE

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:37.079 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT THAT THIS IS BEEN

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.848 region:rollup2
THE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE BY THE

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.616 region:rollup2
DDO SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN AN

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:42.118 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ADVISORY HEARINGS ON

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:43.653 region:rollup2
THIS THAT WE PARTICIPATED WITH

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:45.488 region:rollup2
THE DDO AND CONSUMERS UNION

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:47.156 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTERWARDS. AND WAS ALL

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:49.959 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BAR WAS

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:52.261 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED TO ONE LONE PER OF

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
PER LENDER BUT NOT FOR INDUSTRY.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.731 region:rollup2
UP OUR GENERAL CONCERN WITH THIS

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:57.500 region:rollup2
BILL AND WE WERE IN OPPOSITION

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.302 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY TO IT BECAUSE.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.971 region:rollup2
IT'S ONCE AGAIN IT'S RESTRICTING

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:03.639 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CREDIT OF THE BILL

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.875 region:rollup2
THAT THE ORIGINAL PAYDAY LAW WAS

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:07.410 region:rollup2
ENACTED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. IN

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:08.044 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO AND ONCE

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.879 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S NOT A THREE HUNDRED

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.213 region:rollup2
DOLLAR LOAN THIS IS A TWO FIFTY

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.214 region:rollup2
FIVE WON'T REALLY ABOUT TWO

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:15.017 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS WHAT A

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:15.484 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CAN REALLY WALK OUT

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.886 region:rollup2
WITH GIVEN THE FEES.

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.421 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT HAS NOT INCREASED

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.288 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO TO A TIP FOR TWENTY

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:20.656 region:rollup2
ONE YEARS BUT OF COURSE THE

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.958 region:rollup2
EXPENSES TO THE CONSUMER HAVE

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:23.526 region:rollup2
INCREASED. DURING THAT PERIOD

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.328 region:rollup2
TIME ALONG WITH OBVIOUSLY

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
EXPENSES TO THE LENDER AS WELL.

01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:27.663 region:rollup2
SO OF THERE'S JUST SOME

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:28.531 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:30.166 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:32.068 region:rollup2
WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:33.536 region:rollup2
THERE'S ACCESS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:34.704 region:rollup2
IN UNFORTUNATELY WE I FEEL LIKE

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:36.405 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S.

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:37.907 region:rollup2
I AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:39.675 region:rollup2
INSTALLMENT LENDING OVER TWENTY

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:41.177 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED NOW WE'RE LOOKING

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:43.279 region:rollup2
AT LENDING UNDER THREE HUNDRED.

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:45.381 region:rollup2
WE'RE KINDA SQUEEZING.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:46.449 region:rollup2
A BALLOON WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:47.350 region:rollup2
WORK WERE SQUEEZING SOMETHING

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:48.384 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY ISN'T DEMAND IS

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.319 region:rollup2
STILL THERE IF WE'RE GONNA

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:51.787 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED HERE. WE WOULD LOVE

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.855 region:rollup2
TO SEE A REAL APPROACH TO SOLVE

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.256 region:rollup2
THIS HOLISTICALLY AND THAT

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:56.525 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:58.160 region:rollup2
IS TO SOLVE THE CFL.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.462 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.163 region:rollup2
TO MULTIPLE PAYDAY BORROWER OF

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:02.665 region:rollup2
PAYDAY LENDING COMPANIES.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.999 region:rollup2
TO GET THE FUNDS THAT THEY NEED

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:06.635 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:09.205 region:rollup2
CFL AT A RATE WHERE A. WILLING

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:10.940 region:rollup2
LENDER AND WILLING BORROWER CAN

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
GET TOGETHER AND THE LENDER CAN

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.243 region:rollup2
MAKE A REASONABLE.

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:15.344 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE FEE AND PROFIT ON

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.545 region:rollup2
THAT LOAN IN THE PARKING AT THE

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.813 region:rollup2
MONEY THEY NEED WE DON'T HAVE

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.981 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:20.216 region:rollup2
OUR ASSOCIATION'S BEEN HER

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:21.550 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERY YEAR WE'VE HAD

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.718 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.120 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP FIX THIS

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:25.755 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT WE REALLY NEED THE

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.956 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO HELP AS WELL. IF

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:28.424 region:rollup2
YOU WERE TRYING TO RESTRICT THE

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:30.259 region:rollup2
OTHER ENDS OF IT BUT REALLY THE

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:31.627 region:rollup2
CORE PROBLEM IS CUSTOMERS NEED

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.762 region:rollup2
TO SET A THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.430 region:rollup2
THEY NEED A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:34.897 region:rollup2
LOAN AND RIGHT NOW IN FORCE IN

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.298 region:rollup2
THE PILOT PROGRAMS NOT

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:37.867 region:rollup2
SATISFYING THAT. AND AS WE EAT

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:39.368 region:rollup2
AWAY THE EDGES WE'RE JUST GONNA

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:39.802 region:rollup2
LOSE THESE CONSUMERS TO

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:44.039 region:rollup2
UNLICENSED LENDERS.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:47.076 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:47.843 region:rollup2

I'M TONY HADLEY.

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:52.314 region:rollup2
ADVICE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:54.050 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.484 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE CREDIT REPORTING

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.986 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT SPACE TO COSTA MESA

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:59.055 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:00.523 region:rollup2
I'M HERE NOT SO MUCH TO ARGUE

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.091 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:04.260 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THE LAW BUT TO SAY

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.296 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE?

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:09.565 region:rollup2
ENVISIONING CREATING HERE.

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:11.534 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY A STATE RUN

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:12.001 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE AN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:13.669 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXISTS IN THE

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:15.004 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:16.639 region:rollup2
AT THE STATE RUN SYSTEM WOULD

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.873 region:rollup2
COPY OTHER LAWS THAT HAVEN'T

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.140 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.008 region:rollup2
REDUCING.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.743 region:rollup2
.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:22.945 region:rollup2
THE.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.880 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITHOUT.

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
BUT PAYDAY LENDING WHAT THEY DO

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.651 region:rollup2
IS CREATE A SILO OF INFORMATION.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:30.386 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INFORMATION ONLY GOES

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.953 region:rollup2
TO THE LENDER TO TELL THEM

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:32.721 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S ANOTHER LONG

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:34.356 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:35.925 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT DOES IS IGNORES WHAT

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.959 region:rollup2
REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.527 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO WITH THESE

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.462 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AND THAT HAS HELPED

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:41.464 region:rollup2
THEM BUILD BETTER CREDIT

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:43.799 region:rollup2
HISTORIES.

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:45.134 region:rollup2
SO I'M SUGGESTING. THAT THE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:47.269 region:rollup2
STATE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:49.572 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE EXISTING

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:51.373 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS ARE

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:53.309 region:rollup2
FOR SPECIALTY CREDIT BUREAUS IN

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:55.411 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF EXPERIENCE WE RUN

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:58.314 region:rollup2
CLARITY SERVICES THERE ARE

01:16:55.411 --> 01:17:00.783 region:rollup2
COMPETING. ARE. UP ORGANIZATIONS

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:04.753 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE THAT HELP

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:05.354 region:rollup2
LENDERS IN THE PAID A SHORT TERM

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:07.656 region:rollup2
ONLINE LENDING SPACE.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:09.425 region:rollup2
.

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:11.360 region:rollup2
WITH NOT ONLY. DATA BUT DATA

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:13.362 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS TO REALLY GET TO MORE

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.864 region:rollup2
THAN JUST DOES THIS PERSON HAVE

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:16.799 region:rollup2
AN OUTSTANDING LOAN.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:18.567 region:rollup2
BUT IT. IS THIS PERSON

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.802 region:rollup2
CREDITWORTHY AND CAN THIS PERSON

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:21.270 region:rollup2
REALLY AFFORD THIS ABILITY TO

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:23.105 region:rollup2
PAY.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.907 region:rollup2
SO THESE TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
COULD COME INTO PLAY IF WE WERE

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:28.277 region:rollup2
USING THE EXISTING.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.278 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.679 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE RATHER THAN

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:32.414 region:rollup2
CREATE A SILO.

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:34.450 region:rollup2
IT JUST TELLS YOU THAT THE

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:35.484 region:rollup2
PERSON IS TAKEN OUT A LOAN.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:37.286 region:rollup2
IF THEY ARE PAYING THEIR LOAN ON

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.920 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:39.722 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.423 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:43.225 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:44.493 region:rollup2
HAVE A CREDIT HISTORY.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.728 region:rollup2
IF THEY CAN ESTABLISH A CREDIT

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:47.363 region:rollup2
HISTORY WITH THE PAYMENT OF

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:48.364 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM LOANS SOON OTHER

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:50.065 region:rollup2
LENDERS WILL LOOK AT THEM AS

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:52.401 region:rollup2
CREDIT WORTHY.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:54.403 region:rollup2
AND SEE THEM AS A AN INDIVIDUAL

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:56.438 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE A SUITABLE FOR

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:57.973 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND

01:17:56.438 --> 01:18:01.243 region:rollup2
SERVICES THIS IS WHAT WE THINK.

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:03.045 region:rollup2
IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR ROB. UP

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.580 region:rollup2
FOR THE IDEA OF.

THEN THE LENDERS COULD HAVE A

THE CONSUMERS ALL IN THE.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:56.065 region:rollup2

HELP THEM BUILD A BETTER CREDIT

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:59.401 region:rollup2

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.575 region:rollup2

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:17.019 region:rollup2

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:18.887 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM LENDERS

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD BRING THEM IN TO THE

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:22.191 region:rollup2
VISIBILITY BAND EVEN THOSE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:24.360 region:rollup2
LENDERS COULD OFFER THEM

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:26.262 region:rollup2
COMPETING PROCESSES BUT RIGHT

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.998 region:rollup2

RISK IN A REASONABLE MANNER.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:38.507 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE COULD

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:39.575 region:rollup2
DUBBED WORK TOWARD USING THE

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:41.110 region:rollup2

WISH TO BORROW TO FIFTY FIVE

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.193 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY THE

01:27:43.859 --> 01:27:46.895 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM DOLLARS THAT THEY CAN

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:48.663 region:rollup2

AND THEY AGREED TO PAY DATE OUT

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2
TO THEIR NEXT PAYDAY LET'S SAY

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:00.575 region:rollup2
IT'S IN TWO WEEKS. SO ON THE

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.410 region:rollup2

GONNA COME BACK IN AND GIVE US

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.013 region:rollup2
THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:07.315 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY PAY THAT FORTY FIVE

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.816 region:rollup2

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.822 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THE TRANSACTION OVER.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:15.123 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT CHARGING THEM

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:16.224 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL NINETY DOLLARS FOR

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.727 region:rollup2

01:29:16.418 --> 01:29:20.288 region:rollup2
ADDED.

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:22.858 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU.

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:24.759 region:rollup2
BUT THE. SECOND SECOND TIME AS

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:26.194 region:rollup2
LONG AS I. IF I WERE IF I EVERY

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:28.163 region:rollup2
TIME AND SO ALL OF THOSE

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.130 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY HIRES WILL BUILD FORTY

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:30.265 region:rollup2
FIVE.

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:33.501 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE OF FORTY FIVE RIGHT

01:29:30.265 --> 01:29:35.303 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE ADDED.

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:36.838 region:rollup2
THE SONG SOUNDS LIKE ON THAT

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.306 region:rollup2
PROCEED TO IS A NEGATIVE. YOU

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:39.507 region:rollup2
KNOW SO I THINK THAT THAT IT'S A

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:41.543 region:rollup2
WRONG WRONG PRISON PAGE RIGHT

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:43.144 region:rollup2
HERE I THINK ONE THING THAT WE

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:44.079 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAY NOT BE LOOKING AT IS

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:45.046 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE COSTS A LOT OF

01:29:44.079 --> 01:29:46.081 region:rollup2
SOMEONE DOES COME BACK AND

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.315 region:rollup2
REPORT YES THEY GONNA HAVE TO

01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:48.350 region:rollup2
PAY THE FEE AGAIN. JUST LIKE IF

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:51.319 region:rollup2
YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU'RE

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:51.887 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE TO PAY THE FEE AGAIN.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.054 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF YOU BORROW A YOU

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.322 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU.

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.990 region:rollup2
RIDING IT ALONE ON A CAR YOU

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.224 region:rollup2
GONNA PAY A FEE THE SECOND TIME

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:57.659 region:rollup2
TO GO GET ALONG ON A CAR SO IT

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.793 region:rollup2
IS THE ONE THING I THINK THAT

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.495 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT WE COULD

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:01.997 region:rollup2
ADD TO THIS CHART WOULD BE. THE

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:04.199 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THE

01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:05.166 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS ONLY PAYING OUT MONEY.

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:07.802 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT IT THERE REALLY

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:08.370 region:rollup2
ISN'T ANY ANALYSIS HERE ABOUT.

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.437 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THE

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:10.872 region:rollup2
MONEY?

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:12.040 region:rollup2
THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT FORTY

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:13.675 region:rollup2
FIVE DOLLARS ASSIST LOSS THAT

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.743 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THERE'S NOT WORST IT WE

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:16.278 region:rollup2
SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:17.612 region:rollup2
DOING WITH THE PROCEEDS.

01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:19.314 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE OFF SETTING

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:21.316 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE CONSUMERS

01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:21.883 region:rollup2
ARE SMART. THEY WILL COME IN AND

01:30:21.316 --> 01:30:23.551 region:rollup2
BORROW MONEY IF THEY HAVE A

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:24.886 region:rollup2
CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE FOR MORE

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:26.454 region:rollup2
ATTRACTIVE OPTION. THEY

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:28.390 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT FORTY TO

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:30.191 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE IS CHEAPER

01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:31.259 region:rollup2
THAN BOUNCING CHECKS.

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.360 region:rollup2
IF YOU BOUNCE A CHECK IN THE

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.595 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD SAY WE

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.397 region:rollup2
DO WITH ONE OF THE MAJOR BANKS

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:36.598 region:rollup2
WELLS FARGO CHASER P. ABATE

01:30:35.397 --> 01:30:37.499 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE BETWEEN

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:39.000 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY EIGHT

01:30:37.499 --> 01:30:40.468 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. AND THE MERCHANT YOU

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.603 region:rollup2
BOUNCE THAT CHECK TO IS GONNA

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.704 region:rollup2
CHARGE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.039 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE NORTH A FIFTY DOLLARS

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:45.640 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:47.075 region:rollup2
SO CONSUMERS KNOW THAT THAT

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.177 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE IS A LOT.

01:30:47.075 --> 01:30:50.845 region:rollup2
A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THAT

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:53.248 region:rollup2
THAT BOUNCED CHECK WERE PAYING

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:54.649 region:rollup2
UTILITY LATE FEE SO THAT VALUE

01:30:53.248 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE. ARE

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:57.619 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING TO REDUCE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.920 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:00.255 region:rollup2
TO THAT CUSTOMER AND I THINK

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.089 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SHOULD BE ADDED I

01:31:00.255 --> 01:31:02.290 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WOULD HELP THE KIDS

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:03.858 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND AND

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.759 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE TO CONTINUE WOULD

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:09.664 region:rollup2
LIKE TO WORK ON THIS BEFORE THIS

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:10.632 region:rollup2
BILL. GETS PASSED.

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:13.068 region:rollup2
MISTER GRAYSON THANK YOU.

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:15.070 region:rollup2
JUST TO CLARIFY THE CHART

01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:16.805 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE RIGHT.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.239 region:rollup2
IN YOUR REPORT BECAUSE YOU DO I

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.874 region:rollup2
GET THE PART WHERE IT SAYS FEES

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:21.176 region:rollup2
PAID CUMULATIVE.

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:23.178 region:rollup2
BUT THE NET LOAN PROS.

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:24.713 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS.

01:31:23.178 --> 01:31:25.747 region:rollup2
FOR THE GENEROUS SIXTEEN THREE

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:27.315 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN WHERE YOU

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:29.150 region:rollup2
HAVE A CUMULATIVE FEE OF NINETY

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:31.753 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. YOU'RE STILL GETTING

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:33.788 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE NASH YES.

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:34.789 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO TEN.

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:36.558 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE IN A.

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:38.593 region:rollup2
YES

01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:39.127 region:rollup2
SO IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THAT

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:39.861 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FLAW HERE IN THE

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:42.998 region:rollup2
CHART.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:44.432 region:rollup2
I TRIED TO A.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.234 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:48.236 region:rollup2
YEAH ACCENTUATE THE MESSAGE OF

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:51.773 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SEND AN IN AND IF I

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:52.374 region:rollup2
MAY. I DID CREATE A CHART AND SO

01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:53.742 region:rollup2
HARD NOT TO BE OFFENSIVE NO NO

01:31:52.374 --> 01:31:55.243 region:rollup2
NO.

01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:56.778 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANTED TO

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:58.613 region:rollup2
BE INFORMATIVE SO THAT PEOPLE

01:31:56.778 --> 01:32:00.448 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SO.

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:02.083 region:rollup2
I LABEL THAT LAST MET LOAN

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:03.785 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.754 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN YOU GET YOUR

01:32:03.785 --> 01:32:07.355 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL LOAN. EVERY TIME YOU

01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:08.623 region:rollup2
COME BACK AND HAVE TO RENEW THE

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:10.458 region:rollup2
LONG YES ANOTHER FORTY FIVE

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:11.359 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:13.161 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.662 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND SO WHAT I

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:16.064 region:rollup2
WAS TRYING TO SHOW WAS NO NOT AN

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:19.367 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL YOU JUST PAY THE

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:20.702 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE YES YES ANY YOU. KNOW

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:22.270 region:rollup2
CURRENT OTHER THREE HUNDRED

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.405 region:rollup2
DOLLAR LOAN AT THE SAME TIME

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.906 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:27.776 region:rollup2
THE LONG PRINCIPLE DOESN'T GO

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:29.778 region:rollup2
DOWN. OVER THE TIME AS YOU.

01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:32.447 region:rollup2
AS YOU SEE QUINCE THESE LOANS

01:32:29.778 --> 01:32:34.215 region:rollup2
YOU STILL OWE OWN YOU STILL. OWE

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:35.750 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.719 region:rollup2
BUT YOUR NET PROCEEDS GETS

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:39.421 region:rollup2
SMALLER AND SMALLER AS THE FEED

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:39.988 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY

01:32:39.421 --> 01:32:41.489 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME YOU ROLL THE LOAN

01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:43.224 region:rollup2
OVER.

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:44.559 region:rollup2
OKAY I I KNOW.

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:46.494 region:rollup2
I'M I'M NOT SURE I AM NOT

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.095 region:rollup2
CONVINCED THAT SOME YOU HAVE TO

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:48.063 region:rollup2
HELP ME AND GET IT OUT OF THE

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:49.898 region:rollup2
CHURCH.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:52.400 region:rollup2
MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT CREATING

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:57.972 region:rollup2
CLEAR CHARGE.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:58.473 region:rollup2
THE WORSE.

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:00.074 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:32:58.473 --> 01:33:02.077 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:03.778 region:rollup2
AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO MY

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:05.480 region:rollup2
FIRST QUESTION IS FOR IT THE

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:06.648 region:rollup2
MADAM MADAM CHAIR I REALLY

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.183 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS

01:33:06.648 --> 01:33:09.784 region:rollup2
BILL. I THINK IS GOING TO BE.

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:11.953 region:rollup2
IN YOUR TENT TO.

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:13.721 region:rollup2
BUT I CONSUMERS ON HOW OVER IT

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:15.390 region:rollup2
MOST OF.

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:17.559 region:rollup2
SOME OF PHONE CALLS I RECEIVED.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:19.461 region:rollup2
OR LIKE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:21.729 region:rollup2
AND THE CONSUMERS IN WHICH THERE

01:33:19.461 --> 01:33:23.097 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO. HAVE UNFORESEEN

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:25.333 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY TAKING CARE OF UNDER

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:27.635 region:rollup2
ONE LONE HAND STATE PARTAKEN

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:29.003 region:rollup2
ALMOST ACTING IF YOU WILL. SO DO

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:30.738 region:rollup2
YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAVE A

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:32.106 region:rollup2
PERVERSE EFFECT IN TERMS OF THE

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:34.476 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR THEM TO PAY OFF.

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:35.777 region:rollup2
UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:37.979 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT HERE'S HERE

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:39.481 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE BIG SPACES RIGHT

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.281 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT IN

01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:42.150 region:rollup2
THE LAST COMMITTEE IN THIS

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:43.751 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. SO ONE OF THEM IS THE

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:44.419 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND UNDER

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:44.919 region:rollup2
IF YOU NEED MORE THAT YOU

01:33:44.419 --> 01:33:45.920 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GO TO THE PILOT

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.921 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.690 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE REAL ONE TO

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:50.124 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THAT IS

01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:51.459 region:rollup2
AT A ONE NIGHT STAND I WANT TO

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:53.761 region:rollup2
CORRECT WHAT WAS SAID THAT THERE

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:56.097 region:rollup2
IS NOT A LEGAL. SPACE IN PLACE

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:58.166 region:rollup2
THERE IS ILLEGAL SPACE AND PLACE

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:59.133 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO GO UP TO

01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.969 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THEN WE

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:02.237 region:rollup2
HAVE IF YOU RECALL FROM THE LAST

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:03.404 region:rollup2
ONE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UP TO

01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:05.540 region:rollup2
TEN. SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:07.108 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE SPACES THIS IS ONLY

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:09.344 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE SPACE SO IF YOU NEED

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:10.545 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THERE IS

01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:12.180 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL SPACE WITH

01:34:10.545 --> 01:34:13.481 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LAWS THAT THIS BILL

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:15.316 region:rollup2
DOES NOT DEAL WITH THIS THAT THE

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:17.118 region:rollup2
THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM. AND THAT

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:18.086 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN GO INTO IF THE TWENTY

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:19.787 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOT

01:34:18.086 --> 01:34:22.290 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THEN YOU GO INTO ANOTHER

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:24.292 region:rollup2
SPACE THAT GOES FROM TWENTY FIVE

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:26.895 region:rollup2
TO TEN THOUSAND.

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:28.229 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND IDEAL CLASSROOMS

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:30.131 region:rollup2
TO HAVE ONE SO THE OPPOSITE AS

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:31.199 region:rollup2
YOU STATED THAT WITH THE CBO

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:33.234 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF
