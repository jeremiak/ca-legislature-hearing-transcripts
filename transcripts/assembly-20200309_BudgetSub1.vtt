01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.673
MODALITIES OF INJURY THAT WERE

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.009
SUSPICIOUS AND UNEXPLAINED. I

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.243
MET WITH THE FATHER AS I

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.712
NORMALLY DO TOGETHER HISTORY.

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.114
DURING THE HISTORY TAKING IN

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.682
ALL TALKING ABOUT HIS BABY'S

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.851
INJURIES THE FATHER ENDED UP

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.686
TELLING ME THAT AS A CHILD HE

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.922
HAD BEEN IN MORE FOSTER HOMES

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.356
THAN HE COULD REMEMBER. HE

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:09.659
SUFFERED ABUSE IN FOSTER CARE

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.727
AND THROUGHOUT HIS CHILDHOOD.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:12.829
REPORTED TO ME THAT HE SAW

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:16.265
THERAPISTS AND CONSISTENTLY AND

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:18.167
HAD MANY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.403
WHEN HE TURNED EIGHTEEN HE WAS

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.305
TIRED OF BEING A FOSTER YOUTH

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.040
HE LEFT THE SYSTEM BECAME

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.241
HOMELESS AND THEN BECAME A

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:28.244
FATHER. WHEN I SAT WITH HIM

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.378
SOMETHING WAS VERY FAMILIAR TO

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:33.483
ME. HE EVENTUALLY TOLD ME ABOUT

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.751
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED HIM

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.319
TO FOSTER CARE IN THE FIRST

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.554
PLACE. IN THE MOMENTS THAT

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.823
CHANGED MY LIFE HE SHOWED ME

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.326
SCARS ON HIS HANDS FROM ABUSE.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.394
AND THAT'S WHEN I REMEMBERED.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.096
HE WAS FAMILIAR BECAUSE I WAS

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.064
THE PHYSICIAN WHO MADE THE

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.533
DIAGNOSIS OF ABUSE WHEN HE WAS

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.668
A LITTLE BOY. DESPITE TAKING

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.403
EVERY ACTION THAT I KNEW TO

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.738
HELP HIM AND TO BREAK THE

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:59.008
CYCLES OF ABUSE I WAS NOW THERE

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:00.443
TO WATCH AS HE WAS ARRESTED FOR

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.477
FATAL INJURIES THAT HE CAUGHT

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:04.380
CHILD. THIS STORY IS NOT

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.683
UNUSUAL OR RARE. CHILD ABUSE IS

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.019
A PERVASIVE PREVALENT DISEASE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.555
PROCESS AMONG OUR CHILDREN.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.756
WHEN I HEARD DOCTOR BURKE KERRY

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:16.359

FELLOW CHILD ABUSE PHYSICIAN

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.098
WHO SAID THAT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.033

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.701

NEGLECTING COST. QUALITY EQUITY

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.395
ON THE GOAL HERE IS ONE OF

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.230
ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.798
NOT ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:45.999
MANDATES BUT REALLY LOOKING TO

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:48.802
SEE- WHAT IS A PARTY SET

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:49.403
STANDARD MEASURES THAT CAN BE

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:52.706
USED. THERE'S ALSO GOAL TO

PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.076
MODELS OF SHIFTING THE SYSTEM

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:58.445

QUALITY AND COST EFFICIENT

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.586
CARE-THIS WILL INVOLVE

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.553

THAT CAN BE ADOPTED. BY PAYERS

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.326
AND PROVIDERS AND I THINK SOME

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:13.360
OF THE SPEAKERS MENTION THEM

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.162
PORTENTS OF PRIMARY CARE

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:17.931
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS-

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:19.666
THOSE WOULD BE KEY AS WELL AS-

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:22.169
MODELS OF SHARED SAVINGS OUR

01:42:22.236 --> 01:42:24.304
POPULATION BASED PAYMENTS.

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.472
THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:26.773
FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.041
IMPACT AS WE CHANGE THE

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:28.976

AVOIDING UNINTENDED

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:35.382
CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.885
LOWERING STANDARDS ENCOURAGING

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:40.821
LAYOFFS- AND SO THE OFFICE WILL

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:42.089
HAVE A GOAL OF ENCOURAGING HIGH

01:42:42.155 --> 01:42:43.891

WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:10.624
CREATE ADDITIONAL REGULAR.

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:12.626
DISTRO BURDENS AND PROVIDERS

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:14.194
AND SYSTEMS AND SO THAT'S

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:17.597
REALLY- THREADED THROUGHOUT.

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:19.933
I'M IN THE ONLY OTHER ASPECT OF

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.402
THAT  WOULD ADD IS THAT.

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:23.136
EARLIER WE HEARD THAT HEALTH

CARE COSTS IS INCREDIBLY

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:34.114
IMPORTANT. AS WE SEE A LARGER

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:37.017
SHARE OF THEIR COMPENSATION

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:39.186
GOING TOWARDS HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:40.821
RATHER THAN TAKE HOME PAY AND

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.756

NEW. COLLECTIVE PROVIDE DATA

01:48:41.748 --> 01:48:43.416
AND I THINK THAT- WHEN WE'RE

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.886
LOOKING AT OUTCOMES AND THE

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:47.621

ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THIS WHICH

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.745
IS THE- I BELIEVE IS A CRITICAL

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:13.947

SORRY PROGRAM. IS A IS ACTUALLY

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.388
CRITICAL OF THE WORK OF THIS-

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.791
OFFICE I THINK FOR THE PURPOSE

01:49:57.857 --> 01:50:00.994
OF THE COST TARGETS- THEPAIR

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.462
LEVEL DATA FROM OUR

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:03.830
UNDERSTANDING AGAIN LOOKING AT

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:04.998
MODELS FROM SOME OF THE EXPERTS

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:07.901
THAT YOU BROUGHT IN EARLIER- IS

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:10.136
THE NATIONAL CUT TO LOOK AT-

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:11.671
EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA WE

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.406
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:14.341
OFFICE SHOULD HAVE THE

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:17.344
AUTHORITY TO. COLLECT PROVIDER

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.946
DATA AS NEEDED ONCE WE DEVELOP-

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:21.448
AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:24.351
LANDSCAPE IS ACROSS THE STATE

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:26.353
WHAT AREAS WE MAY NEED

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:28.989
ADDITIONAL- GRANULARITY OTHER

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:31.358
PEOPLE ARE REALLY- COGNIZANT OF

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.393
IS THE NEED TO STAND THIS UP

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.496
QUICKLY AND THE LOGISTICAL AND

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.565
NOT A LOGICAL CHALLENGES OF

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:41.301
BRINGING IN FIGHTER DATA WHAT

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:42.602
MUCH MORE VARIABLE FORMAT THAN

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:45.705
PAYER DATA ENTRY RECORD PILOT

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:48.241
ON THE BACK NOT TO SAY THAT

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:50.243
WORK. IN IN THAT WE'RE JUST

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:53.146
BEING REALISTIC TERMS WE'RE

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:55.081
GONNA BE STEP THEN WANTING TO

01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:57.150
EARN FROM WHERE ARE SEE WHAT

01:50:57.217 --> 01:50:58.852
HE'D IT MEANT AND FIGURE OUT

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:03.623
WHERE WE- FOR. WHITER PARTY. I

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:04.524
WOULD JUST A PERSONAL PLUG IS

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:06.493
LOOK AT I THINK CARE OUTCOMES

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.261
CRITIC COME HERE IN IN IN THE

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:10.196
SYSTEM AND SO IT'S A BECOMES

01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:11.965
IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:51:12.032 --> 01:51:13.700
THAT IF WE'RE DOING TREATMENT A

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:15.368
CERTAIN WAY AND GETTING AND

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:16.803
WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES WERE

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:18.071
GETTING AND ARE THOSE ARE THOSE

01:51:18.138 --> 01:51:19.506
THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. I

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:21.041
THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.543
HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHICH IS OUT

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.378
ALSO OF CONCERN IS THAT THAT

01:51:25.445 --> 01:51:28.882
SAVINGS ULTIMATELY- BE REALIZED

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:33.453
BY CONSUMERS AND- AND SO HOW DO

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.354
YOU HOW DO YOU ENVISION THAT DO

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.589
YOU HAVE HAS THE ADMINISTRATION

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.491
ENVISIONED GOING FORWARD. OF I

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:40.693
WILL SAY THIS IS SOMETHING WE

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.594
TALKED ABOUT FROM THE VERY

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:44.264
BEGINNING- AND THIS IS WHERE

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.931
WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:46.332
CUTTING EDGE BECAUSE I THINK

01:51:46.399 --> 01:51:47.434
THERE ARE SOME OTHER STATES

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.502
HAVE- LOOKED AT COST TARGETS

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:52.305
BUT DIDN'T HAVE AFFORDABILITY-

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:53.807
IN. IN RIGHT IN THE BULL'S EYE

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:55.341
AND THEN KIND OF MISS THE MARK

01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:58.011
THERE- SOME OF THE THOUGHTS WE

01:51:58.078 --> 01:52:00.313
HAVE ARE. A CREATING A MEASURE

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:03.650
OF AFFORDABILITY SO MEASURING-COMPLETELY OUT OF POCKET COSTS

01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:06.519
IN TERMS OF- OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.053
GET THE UNINSURED BUT FOR

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.023
ANYONE WHO. IS INSURED-

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:12.725
CONSUMER AM COPAYS COINSURANCE

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:15.095
DEDUCTIBLES AND TRACKING THAT

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.564
IS A MEASURE AS WELL AS GROWTH

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:18.965
IN PREMIUMS. AND ACTUALLY

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:21.401
TRYING TO. THAT ALSO MEET SOME

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:22.869
KIND OF TARGET WOULD BE A WAY

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.304
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FORD

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:25.772
ABILITY COMPONENT IS SQUARELY

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:27.173
CENTERED ON CONSUMERS WE'VE

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.208
ALSO TALKED ABOUT OTHER

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:29.843
MECHANISMS OF MECHANISMS LIKE

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:31.411
THE AND ALL OUR REBATE. BUT

01:52:31.478 --> 01:52:32.912
AGAIN WE'RE REALLY LEERY OF

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:35.281
GIVING EVERYBODY A TO OUR CHECK

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:36.850
WHEN REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:40.153
A MAKE SURE PREMIUM- OVERALL

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.221
COST OF CARE MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:43.123
I'D I'D FOR SMALL AND I'M I'M

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:45.492
I'M SUPPORTIVE OBVIOUSLY- AND

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:47.894
YEAH I THINK WHEN YOU CONSIDER-

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.329
AND I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:51.364
NUMBERS BUT IT HAS HAS BEEN

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.999
HOVERING AROUND TWICE THE RATE

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:53.867
OF INFLATION AND THE COST OF.

03:35:06.326 --> 03:35:07.294
THOUSAND HE IF YOU KNOW YOU

03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:11.298
THOUSAND. WHAT KIND OF FLIPPING

03:35:11.365 --> 03:35:12.266
IT SOMETIMES LIKE A REVERSE

03:35:12.332 --> 03:35:13.867
ACTION YOU TELL US HOW MANY

03:35:13.934 --> 03:35:14.468
PEOPLE YOU CAN GROW WITH HOW

03:35:14.534 --> 03:35:15.869
MUCH MONEY. BUT WE'RE GEARING

03:35:15.936 --> 03:35:18.438
THE SCORING HEAVILY TOWARDS-

03:35:18.505 --> 03:35:20.107
LAUREN THAT PER CAPITA COST WE

03:35:20.173 --> 03:35:21.408
CAN REALLY GROWTHAT NUMBER I

03:35:21.475 --> 03:35:24.311
CAN MAKE THE BEST USE. THAT

03:35:24.378 --> 03:35:25.579
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE

03:35:25.646 --> 03:35:27.447
A- FOLLOW UP QUESTION IF I CAN

WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A PROPOSAL

03:35:28.982 --> 03:35:30.584
LATER REGARDING ANOTHER ONE

03:35:30.651 --> 03:35:32.586
TIME FUNDING. AND I'M WONDERING

03:35:32.653 --> 03:35:34.521
HOW USEFUL IT IS FOR ONE TIME

03:35:34.588 --> 03:35:36.490
FUNDING FOR. GROWTH OF

03:35:36.556 --> 03:35:38.692
RESIDENCY SLOTS. IS THERE A

03:35:38.759 --> 03:35:41.094
NEED FOR. US TO HAVE CONTINUED

03:35:41.161 --> 03:35:43.263
FUNDING IN THIS AREA AND- DO

03:35:43.330 --> 03:35:44.765
YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATED IDEA OF

03:35:44.831 --> 03:35:46.133
HOW MUCH THAT. FUNDING WOULD

03:35:46.199 --> 03:35:49.536
BE- OR SHOULD WE- CONTINUE YEAR

03:35:49.603 --> 03:35:51.672
AFTER YEAR COMING BACK FOR

03:35:51.738 --> 03:35:54.374
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. I THINK

03:35:54.441 --> 03:35:55.709
THAT SOME REALLY COMPLICATED

03:35:55.776 --> 03:35:56.910
QUESTION ON I THINK OF IT IN

03:35:56.977 --> 03:35:58.345
THE SCHEMES OF WE HAVE PRIMARY

03:35:58.412 --> 03:35:59.546
CARE RESIDENCY SLOTS AND

03:35:59.613 --> 03:36:01.048
PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY SLOTS AND

03:36:01.114 --> 03:36:02.282
SPECIALTY SLOTS AS WERE

03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:03.383
MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO IT'S A

03:36:03.450 --> 03:36:04.651
IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED

03:36:04.718 --> 03:36:07.354
QUESTION- YEAH I THINK THAT

03:36:07.421 --> 03:36:08.255
THAT WHAT WE HEARD FROM SOME OF

03:36:08.322 --> 03:36:09.389
THE PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR

03:36:09.456 --> 03:36:11.725
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WAS. IT BE

03:36:11.792 --> 03:36:12.859
NICE IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS

03:36:12.926 --> 03:36:14.394
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT

03:36:14.461 --> 03:36:16.697
THIS ON GOING BUT- THAT THEY'RE

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:17.331
NOT GOING TO TURN DOWN ONE TIME

03:36:17.397 --> 03:36:19.466
FUNDS EITHER- AND SO WE'RE

03:36:19.533 --> 03:36:21.368
AGAIN TRYING TO STRUCTURE OUR-

03:36:21.435 --> 03:36:23.437
AWARDS. AROUND KNOWING THAT

03:36:23.503 --> 03:36:24.905
THERE MAY NOT BE ADDITIONAL

03:36:24.971 --> 03:36:26.073
FUNDS WERE TRYING TO STRUCTURE

03:36:26.139 --> 03:36:27.374
THE AWARDS AND THE INCENTIVES

03:36:27.441 --> 03:36:29.743
SO THAT. THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER

03:36:29.810 --> 03:36:32.479
A SUSTAINABLE PROPOSAL WITH THE

03:36:32.546 --> 03:36:34.414
LIMITED AVAILABLE OF THAT WITH

03:36:34.481 --> 03:36:37.017
WITH WITH THE KNOWN AVAILABLE

03:36:37.084 --> 03:36:39.753
FUNDS- I WOULD. LIKE TO FOLLOW

03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:42.422
UP IN THE NEXT ISSUE REGARDING

03:36:42.489 --> 03:36:44.191
HOW WE ENSURE IT'S EIGHT TWO

03:36:44.257 --> 03:36:46.860
LOT. AS THEY HAVE SOME.

03:36:46.927 --> 03:36:47.961
REGARDING SOME OF THE SONG

03:36:48.028 --> 03:36:51.198
BROWN AND- AS AN ISSUE BUT I

03:36:51.264 --> 03:36:54.201
DIDN'T. HEAR THAT YOU ALSO DEAL

03:36:54.267 --> 03:36:56.036
WITH HEALTHCARE DESTRUCTION AND

03:36:56.103 --> 03:36:58.071
FINANCING AND- YOU BROUGHT UP

03:36:58.138 --> 03:37:01.274
THE TWENTY TH A- SEISMIC AND-

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:06.012
THAT WE HAVE. AND I THINK MY-

03:37:06.079 --> 03:37:07.881
QUESTION JUST FIRST. GENERAL

03:37:07.948 --> 03:37:08.882
HOW MUCH OF A NON MANDATE IS

03:37:08.949 --> 03:37:10.951
THE- SEISMIC BILL THAT WAS

03:37:11.017 --> 03:37:13.019
PASSED RECENTLY REQUIRING

03:37:13.086 --> 03:37:15.355
TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE. DO WE

03:37:15.422 --> 03:37:16.790
HAVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THE STATE

03:37:16.857 --> 03:37:17.824
OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S A VERY

03:37:17.891 --> 03:37:19.259
INTERESTING QUESTION I WOULD

03:37:19.326 --> 03:37:21.595
SAY THE AWESOME IT. DOES NOT

03:37:21.661 --> 03:37:23.263
HAVE AN ESTIMATE THERE IS A

03:37:23.330 --> 03:37:25.399
STUDY OUT THERE THE RAND STUDY

03:37:25.465 --> 03:37:27.834
IN WE ASSISTED WITH THAT STUDY

03:37:27.901 --> 03:37:29.970
A WE CAN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY

03:37:30.036 --> 03:37:31.972
THAT ITS CONCLUSIONS OF I SEE

03:37:32.038 --> 03:37:33.039
PAUL COLEMAN OR DEBBIE

03:37:33.106 --> 03:37:34.875
DIRECTORS COMING UP HERE YOU

03:37:34.941 --> 03:37:41.448
MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SAY. GOOD

03:37:41.515 --> 03:37:45.519
EVENING ALL COMMON OF THE US W.

03:37:45.585 --> 03:37:46.653
DIRECTOR FOR THE FACILITIES

03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:47.654
DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE

03:37:47.721 --> 03:37:49.389
ARCH BUT OUR OFFICES THEY WORK

03:37:49.456 --> 03:37:51.725
OF PANNING DEVELOPMENT- PART

03:37:51.792 --> 03:37:53.460
OF THE ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO

03:37:53.527 --> 03:37:56.730
COST IS THAT IT IS- CONSTANTLY

03:37:56.797 --> 03:38:00.300
MOVING TARGET- HOSPITALS HAVE

03:38:00.367 --> 03:38:02.803
FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE AB TWENTY

03:38:02.869 --> 03:38:04.271
ONE NINETY OF PART OF WHAT WAS

03:38:04.337 --> 03:38:07.307
DRIVING HOSPITALS TO USE THAT-

03:38:07.374 --> 03:38:09.443
PROGRAM OR THAT EXTENSION WAS

03:38:09.509 --> 03:38:10.544
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CHANGE

03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:12.846
THEIR COMPLIANCE. APPROACH

03:38:12.913 --> 03:38:14.314
METHOD ALSO SOMETIMES WILL

03:38:14.381 --> 03:38:15.849
START ALSO THEY WANT TO PREVENT

03:38:15.916 --> 03:38:17.150
THE NOTES CHANGED DECIDE THEY

03:38:17.217 --> 03:38:18.718
WANTED TO A NEW BUILDING

03:38:18.785 --> 03:38:20.654
INSTEAD. SO WE CAN'T PREDICT

03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:23.123
WHAT THE HOSPITAL SIGNED UP TO.

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:24.991
WELL IN THE DOING WE CAN JUST

03:38:25.058 --> 03:38:26.059
LOOK AT HISTORICALLY WHAT IT

03:38:26.126 --> 03:38:30.030
HAS COST. TO DO EACH OF THE

03:38:30.096 --> 03:38:30.864
DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPLIANCE.

03:38:30.931 --> 03:38:32.732
WHICH THAT INFORMATION PROVIDE

03:38:32.799 --> 03:38:33.900
IN FURTHER STUDY AND I THINK

03:38:33.967 --> 03:38:37.237
THAT'S HOW THEY AREDERIVED THE

03:38:37.304 --> 03:38:38.205
NUMBERS THAT THEY CAME UP WITH

03:38:38.271 --> 03:38:40.841
ANECDOTAL IF I. MAY I. THINK

03:38:40.907 --> 03:38:42.209
IT'S AWFULLY HARD FOR US TO

03:38:42.275 --> 03:38:44.511
HAVE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING

03:38:44.578 --> 03:38:46.480
AFFORDABILITY AND NOT KNOW.

03:38:46.546 --> 03:38:48.315
INHERENTLY THE UNFUNDED MANDATE

03:38:48.381 --> 03:38:50.984
THAT COMES WITH THIS SEISMIC

03:38:51.051 --> 03:38:53.386
BUILT IN SO I THINK HOSPITALS

03:38:53.453 --> 03:38:55.188
ARE HAVING DIFFICULT

03:38:55.255 --> 03:38:57.591
CONVERSATIONS NOW STARTING TO

03:38:57.657 --> 03:38:59.659
PREPARE FOR TWENTY THIRTY AS

03:38:59.726 --> 03:39:01.094
THESE CONSTRUCTION COSTS CANNOT

03:39:01.161 --> 03:39:03.864
BE BORE IN A SINGLE YEAR. AND I

03:39:03.930 --> 03:39:05.732
HAVE CONCERNS COMING FROM A

03:39:05.799 --> 03:39:07.167
PART OF THE STATE THAT'S NOT A

03:39:07.234 --> 03:39:09.803
SEISMICALLY. ACTIVE AS THE

03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:12.706
COASTAL REGIONS THAT- THE

03:39:12.772 --> 03:39:14.107
HOSPITAL WHERE I TRAINED AT A

03:39:14.174 --> 03:39:15.475
LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER IS

BEGINS TO- DIMINISH AS WE REACH

03:39:49.109 --> 03:39:50.677
THE SIX O'CLOCK HOUR BUT MY

03:39:50.744 --> 03:39:52.512

UPGRADE AT. COMPLIANCE ISSUES

03:39:56.917 --> 03:39:59.753
AND MY MEMORY OF THAT RAND

03:39:59.819 --> 03:40:01.855
STUDY IS THAT THE COST

03:40:01.922 --> 03:40:03.390

03:40:03.456 --> 03:40:04.391
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION

03:40:04.457 --> 03:40:06.393

AS I RECALL TO RETROFIT THE

IF A FIVE STILL CORRECT MY

03:40:18.738 --> 03:40:19.773

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:26.212
PERCENT. BUT IT'S MEDICARE

03:40:26.279 --> 03:40:28.882
MEDICAID- MEDI CAL AND SO HOW

03:40:28.949 --> 03:40:30.650
DOES A HOSPITAL LIKE THAT HAVE

03:40:30.717 --> 03:40:32.986

ASK US TO ADDRESS IN REGARDS TO

03:46:48.328 --> 03:46:49.495

OPPOSITION AND LOAN REPAYMENT

03:46:50.697 --> 03:46:52.765

INCREASED PARTICIPATION. IN CO

03:46:55.902 --> 03:46:56.936
ONE WHICH THERE ARE CURRENTLY

03:46:57.003 --> 03:46:58.404

POSITIONS AND FORTY DENNIS BUT

03:47:04.344 --> 03:47:06.379
A LOT OF REPEAT. PRO ALL IN THE

03:47:06.446 --> 03:47:07.747
LONG PAYMENT I'M FOR THE FIRST

03:47:07.814 --> 03:47:08.715
COURT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

03:47:08.781 --> 03:47:11.384
PRACTICE SUPPORT GRANTS GIVEN.

03:47:11.451 --> 03:47:12.819
OF IS A SIGNATURE PORTION OF

03:47:12.885 --> 03:47:14.120
POSITION ARE COMING IN NEW TO

03:47:14.187 --> 03:47:15.621
THE PROGRAM WHICH WE SAW IS

03:47:15.688 --> 03:47:17.857
REALLY- AS A GOOD SIGN. THE

03:47:17.924 --> 03:47:18.858
OTHER THING THAT I WOULD POINT

03:47:18.925 --> 03:47:20.226
OUT IS WE DO HAVE SOME A

03:47:20.293 --> 03:47:21.894
SUCCESS STORY FOR EXAMPLE. WE

03:47:21.961 --> 03:47:23.830
HAD A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST WHO

03:47:23.896 --> 03:47:25.131
APPLIED FOR THE LOAN REPAYMENT

03:47:25.198 --> 03:47:27.033
PROGRAM THIS PARTICULAR-

03:47:27.100 --> 03:47:29.035
INDIVIDUAL WAS AND DID THEIR

03:47:29.102 --> 03:47:30.670
MEDICAL SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA

03:47:30.737 --> 03:47:31.904
BUT THE RESIDENCY WAS OUT OF

03:47:31.971 --> 03:47:33.206
STATE. THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY

03:47:33.272 --> 03:47:34.774
GOING TO. BE PUTTING THEIR

03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:36.075
PRACTICE UP IN THE ATLANTA

03:47:36.142 --> 03:47:39.012
AREA. WHEN HEARING ABOUT THE

03:47:39.078 --> 03:47:41.247
PROGRAM- THEY DECIDED TO APPLY

03:47:41.314 --> 03:47:42.915
IN WHEN UPON GRANTED THEY NOW

03:47:42.982 --> 03:47:44.550
ARE PROVIDER IN THE CENTRAL

03:47:44.617 --> 03:47:46.919
VALLEY- PROVIDING SERVICE 294%

03:47:46.986 --> 03:47:48.121
MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES BY

OPENING THEIR PRACTICE THERE.

03:47:49.489 --> 03:47:51.024
SO THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE IN

03:47:51.090 --> 03:47:52.325
REGARDS TO THIS PROGRAM.

03:47:52.392 --> 03:47:55.361
HOWEVER PSYCHIATRIST YES WE DO

03:47:55.428 --> 03:47:56.095
DEFINITELY IN THE CENTRAL

03:47:56.162 --> 03:47:58.331
VALLEY- HOWEVER THIS IS STILL

03:47:58.398 --> 03:48:00.266
AN EARLY PROGRAM IT IS HARD FOR

03:48:00.333 --> 03:48:01.267
US TO SIT AND SAY THAT THERE'S

03:48:01.334 --> 03:48:02.835
EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO

03:48:02.902 --> 03:48:04.570
HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS. TO

03:48:04.637 --> 03:48:06.172
SERVICES- BUT WE DO THINK THAT

03:48:06.239 --> 03:48:08.374
IT IS VERY PROMISING PROGRAM-

03:48:08.441 --> 03:48:09.742
THE ONLY THE FIRST CORPS HURT

03:48:09.809 --> 03:48:11.477

03:48:14.947 --> 03:48:15.815

TWENTY. AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE

03:48:20.186 --> 03:48:22.388
TO SEE UPON WHAT THEY COMMITTED

03:48:22.455 --> 03:48:23.856
TO WHETHER THOSE OBLIGATIONS

03:48:23.923 --> 03:48:25.324
WERE MET WITH THEM THAT FIRST

03:48:25.391 --> 03:48:27.393

03:48:46.145 --> 03:48:46.546
ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS

03:48:46.612 --> 03:48:47.814
QUESTIONS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE

03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:49.615

FOR ONE YEAR EXTENSIONS AND

03:52:32.705 --> 03:52:33.639
SUCH SO WE CAN KIND OF DRAG OUT

03:52:33.706 --> 03:52:36.942
THE- OR- ANY ENHANCE THE RICH%

03:52:37.009 --> 03:52:38.177
WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS AND

03:52:38.244 --> 03:52:41.280
WITHIN EACH REGION SO THE THIS.

03:52:41.347 --> 03:52:42.148
CREATED AS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

03:52:42.214 --> 03:52:43.649
HAPPENED IS THAT SOME THE

03:52:43.716 --> 03:52:47.320
EFFECT OF FORCED AND OFTEN. SO

03:52:47.386 --> 03:52:50.690
AS FAR AS I'VE MENTIONED TODAY

03:52:50.756 --> 03:52:53.459
OFFICE IS LIKE IT'S MORE OF

03:52:53.526 --> 03:52:55.728
THIS ASSN MEASURE THE IMPACT OF

03:52:55.795 --> 03:52:57.263
OFFICE FORCE PRO. AND I DON'T

03:52:57.330 --> 03:52:58.864
TO PAINT WITH TO BE OF A BRUSH

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:01.534
HERE BUT I SAY SORT OF CAN'T.

03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:04.103
THAT IN HIS IS THE STORE WE

03:53:04.170 --> 03:53:06.806
HAVE A LOT OF THE DATA OUT

03:53:06.872 --> 03:53:15.281
AWARDED WHOLE. THE DEMO. MY

03:53:15.348 --> 03:53:18.751
LOCAL I. IN. WE SPENT THE-

03:53:18.818 --> 03:53:19.618
NECESSARILY GETTING AWAY THAT

03:53:19.685 --> 03:53:21.020
DO WE DO. THE IMPACT HOW DID WE

03:53:21.087 --> 03:53:22.188
GET TO IN. ACCESS TO CARE HOW

03:53:22.254 --> 03:53:24.256
DID WE CHANGE THE LAND. WITH A

03:53:24.323 --> 03:53:25.624
TELL. THEM THAT'S THAT WERE

03:53:25.691 --> 03:53:27.293
REALLY TAKE A OF NEW APPROACH

03:53:27.360 --> 03:53:29.061
TO LOOKING AT SO. WHAT I THINK

03:53:29.128 --> 03:53:31.197
WOULD BE HEALTH THOUGH. TO IS

03:53:31.263 --> 03:53:32.164
TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF A

03:53:32.231 --> 03:53:33.332
PROGRAM AND- WHAT WE HAVE

03:53:33.399 --> 03:53:34.800
MEASURED PREVIOUSLY BUT WILL

03:53:34.867 --> 03:53:36.469
CONTINUE TO MEASURE. COURSE AND

03:53:36.535 --> 03:53:37.670
THEN ALSO SORT OF PLANS FOR AND-

03:53:37.737 --> 03:53:39.138
WHAT WE MEASURING. AND IS JUST

03:53:39.205 --> 03:53:40.272
A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF OUR

03:53:40.339 --> 03:53:41.507
EFFORTS KNOWING. WE REALLY DO

03:53:41.574 --> 03:53:43.509
HAVE A IT A NEW LOOK AT WE'RE

03:53:43.576 --> 03:53:48.114
OF THE IMPACTS PROGRAM HAVE AND

03:53:48.180 --> 03:53:48.948
STARTING WITH OF COURSE THE-

03:53:49.014 --> 03:53:50.216
GOALS THOSE PRO. BECAUSE REALLY

03:53:50.282 --> 03:53:51.884
EASY SAY THAT WE HAVE A- SO.

03:53:51.951 --> 03:53:54.053
WHY WE JUST GOT RID OF TIPS IS

03:53:54.120 --> 03:53:56.489
ALSO. WELL MAYBE THERE'S- THERE

03:53:56.555 --> 03:53:58.224
OTHER THAT MY BE. THE FOR EACH

03:53:58.290 --> 03:54:01.260
OF THESE FOR. SO WITH THE SONG

03:54:01.327 --> 03:54:03.195
FOR BROWN. THE STATUTORY

03:54:03.262 --> 03:54:04.296
DEFINED OF. IS TO INCREASE

03:54:04.363 --> 03:54:06.332
NUMBER OF AN REPRESENT MINORITY

03:54:06.399 --> 03:54:08.768
CARE PART. THE TRAIN OLD. PER

03:54:08.834 --> 03:54:10.503
IN AREAS THAT MANY. AND WE DO

03:54:10.569 --> 03:54:12.571
THAT. GRANTS TO. TRAINING

03:54:12.638 --> 03:54:18.577
PROGRAM. THREE YEARS AGO THE

03:54:18.644 --> 03:54:19.645
CALIFORNIA CARE WERE. POLICY

03:54:19.712 --> 03:54:20.646
CAN THAT. MAKES RECOMMEND. ON

03:54:20.713 --> 03:54:22.281
HOW TO A WAR THESE FUN.

03:54:22.348 --> 03:54:23.549
COMPLETELY THEIR SCORE IN

03:54:23.616 --> 03:54:24.150
APPROACH THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY

03:54:24.216 --> 03:54:25.751
IN THE COMING. YEARS AND NOW

03:54:25.818 --> 03:54:26.952
START TO HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME

03:54:27.019 --> 03:54:28.854
DATA AROUND. ARE WE MAKING AN

03:54:28.921 --> 03:54:30.289
IMPACT ARE THESE FUNDS AN

03:54:30.356 --> 03:54:34.160
INCENTIVE TO PROGRAMS TO.

03:54:34.226 --> 03:54:35.060
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

03:54:35.127 --> 03:54:35.861
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES

03:54:35.928 --> 03:54:37.430
THAT THEY TRAIN AS WELL AS

03:54:37.496 --> 03:54:39.064
TRAINING PLACE AND IN AREAS OF

03:54:39.131 --> 03:54:41.133
UNMET NEED- THROUGH A VERY

03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:42.368
QUICK SO THEY USED TO BE A

03:54:42.435 --> 03:54:43.536
HISTORICALLY QUALITATIVE

03:54:43.602 --> 03:54:44.603
APPROACH AND IT'S A VERY

03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:46.038
QUANTITATIVE APPROACH WHERE THE

03:54:46.105 --> 03:54:47.807
WE LET THE PROGRAM'S DATA SPEAK

03:54:47.873 --> 03:54:48.974
FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN THAT'S

03:54:49.041 --> 03:54:51.377
THAT DATA THAT DRIVES- OUR

03:54:51.444 --> 03:54:55.281
AWARDS- AND SO WHAT WE- HOPE TO

03:54:55.347 --> 03:54:57.316
BE ABLE TO DO IS TO. TO

03:54:57.383 --> 03:54:59.351
BENCHMARK THAT WE CAN SAY IT.

03:54:59.418 --> 03:55:00.019
PREVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT

03:55:00.085 --> 03:55:01.353
CALIFORNIA THE PROGRAMS OR

03:55:01.420 --> 03:55:03.055
APPLYING TO US WE SHOULD BE

03:55:03.122 --> 03:55:04.356
ABLE TO SEE THAT THE PERCENTAGE

03:55:04.423 --> 03:55:05.891
OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES

03:55:05.958 --> 03:55:07.026
INCREASES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

03:55:07.092 --> 03:55:08.461
SEE THAT TRAINING IN AREAS OF

03:55:08.527 --> 03:55:10.396
UNMET NEED INCREASES. AND WILL

03:55:10.463 --> 03:55:11.697
BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT AND

03:55:11.764 --> 03:55:12.665
DEMONSTRATE THAT NOISE THAT WE

03:55:12.731 --> 03:55:13.232
WEREN'T ABLE TO NECESSARILY

03:55:13.299 --> 03:55:14.867
TRACK BEFORE BECAUSE WE JUST

03:55:14.934 --> 03:55:15.401
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

03:55:15.468 --> 03:55:16.635
DATA. I'M SO THAT'S SOMETHING

03:55:16.702 --> 03:55:18.204
THAT WE'RE PLANNING TO LOOK FOR

03:55:18.270 --> 03:55:19.805
TO DEMONSTRATE OUR IMPACT ON

03:55:19.872 --> 03:55:21.273
ENSURING THAT WERE CHANGING THE

03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:22.908
LANDSCAPE ARE PEOPLE BEING

03:55:22.975 --> 03:55:24.410
TRAINED IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED

03:55:24.477 --> 03:55:26.278
AND ULTIMATELY. PRACTICING IN

03:55:26.345 --> 03:55:30.749
THOSE AREAS- CURRENTLY THE WHAT

03:55:30.816 --> 03:55:31.951
DO WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OR SOME

03:55:32.017 --> 03:55:32.918
RAM PROGRAMS WE DO KNOW THAT

03:55:32.985 --> 03:55:35.120
SOME BROWN PROGRAMS. TEND TO BE

03:55:35.187 --> 03:55:36.589
BASED OFF OF HOW WE AWARD OF

03:55:36.655 --> 03:55:38.524
THE BILL- APPLICATIONS THAT WE

03:55:38.591 --> 03:55:39.825
RECEIVE NOT EVERYBODY RECEIVES

03:55:39.892 --> 03:55:41.527
AN AWARD TO RECEIVE MONEY. WE

03:55:41.594 --> 03:55:42.695
KNOW THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING

03:55:42.761 --> 03:55:45.464
GEARED TOWARDS A PROGRAMS THAT

03:55:45.531 --> 03:55:46.332
SCORE THE BEST AT. THE NUMBER

03:55:46.398 --> 03:55:47.867
OF YOUR ENDS THAT THEY TRAIN

03:55:47.933 --> 03:55:49.134
AND REPRESENT A MINORITY SORRY

03:55:49.201 --> 03:55:51.403
THE FOR THE AFRICAN. AS WELL AS

03:55:51.470 --> 03:55:53.105
TRAINING IN THOSE AREAS OF

03:55:53.172 --> 03:55:53.806
UNMET NEED SO WE KNOW THAT

03:55:53.873 --> 03:55:54.340
WE'RE HAVING AN IMMEDIATE

03:55:54.406 --> 03:55:55.808
EFFECTIVE. BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE

03:55:55.875 --> 03:55:57.610
TO SAY TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE

03:55:57.676 --> 03:55:58.644
IF THESE ARE AN INCENTIVE THERE

03:55:58.711 --> 03:55:59.812
ACTUALLY CHANGING PROGRAM

03:55:59.879 --> 03:56:01.247
BEHAVIORS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:56:01.313 --> 03:56:03.916
HOPING TO. MEASURE AND AS AS

03:56:03.983 --> 03:56:06.285
ONE. ASPECT OF WHAT WE HOPE TO

03:56:06.352 --> 03:56:09.955
MEASURE IN THE FUTURE- FOR. IT

03:56:10.022 --> 03:56:11.056
TO THE WAY THE WORK FOR SAID

03:56:11.123 --> 03:56:12.691
YOU. TRAIN FUNDS. THE MAIL

03:56:12.758 --> 03:56:14.527
HEALTH SIR. ACT THEIR PRIMARY

03:56:14.593 --> 03:56:15.628
AIMS TO INCREASE THE

03:56:15.694 --> 03:56:16.629
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF A

03:56:16.695 --> 03:56:17.997
CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORKFORCE

03:56:18.063 --> 03:56:19.131
IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH

03:56:19.198 --> 03:56:21.567
SYSTEM- THE- NEW WHAT. PLAN

03:56:21.634 --> 03:56:23.068
PROVIDES IS IT'S A BEFORE FOR

03:56:23.135 --> 03:56:24.403
SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND- THAT

03:56:24.470 --> 03:56:27.006
SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS- AS WELL AS

03:56:27.072 --> 03:56:28.007
EXPAND THE NUMBER OF

03:56:28.073 --> 03:56:29.408
PSYCHIATRISTS THAT WE TRYING.

03:56:29.475 --> 03:56:30.509
SO FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS

03:56:30.576 --> 03:56:31.644
IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEASURES

03:56:31.710 --> 03:56:32.811
AND DATA THAT WE HOPE TO

03:56:32.878 --> 03:56:34.813
GATHER- TO ALTERNATELY MEASURE

03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:38.050
AND ASSESS. OUR OUR IMPACT- FOR

03:56:38.117 --> 03:56:38.617
THE SAKE EXPANSION COMPONENT

03:56:38.684 --> 03:56:40.352
AND PRETTY CLEARLY ONE OF THE

03:56:40.419 --> 03:56:41.453
OUR OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE

03:56:41.520 --> 03:56:42.755
THE NUMBER OF NEW SLOTS THAT

03:56:42.821 --> 03:56:44.156
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IN

03:56:44.223 --> 03:56:47.560
CALIFORNIA- FOR. THE SUPPORTING

03:56:47.626 --> 03:56:49.929
INDIVIDUALS COMPONENT. THE WORD

03:56:49.995 --> 03:56:51.430
OR GETTING THROUGHOUT. EFFORT

03:56:51.497 --> 03:56:52.298
WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE'RE GOING

03:56:52.364 --> 03:56:54.066
TO HAVE ACCESS TO DATA THAT WE

03:56:54.133 --> 03:56:54.934
DID NOT HAVE IN THE PAST FOR

03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:56.635
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO. IDEALLY

03:56:56.702 --> 03:57:00.873
MEASURE. THE ENTIRE- THE SIZE

03:57:00.940 --> 03:57:01.840
OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH

SYSTEM WORKFORCE AND ARE WE

03:57:03.876 --> 03:57:05.010
HAVING AN IMPACT THAT. INCREASE

03:57:05.077 --> 03:57:07.713
IN IT. AND ALSO MEASURE

03:57:07.780 --> 03:57:08.247
RETENTION RATES WITHIN THE

03:57:08.314 --> 03:57:09.515
PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS DO

03:57:09.582 --> 03:57:11.951
TO OUR- AND IT WAS SORT OF LOOK

03:57:12.017 --> 03:57:13.252
GLOBALLY BUT THEN I ALSO TRY TO

03:57:13.319 --> 03:57:14.753
MEASURE MORE. SPECIFIC

03:57:14.820 --> 03:57:15.487
INFORMATION ABOUT THE

03:57:15.554 --> 03:57:19.325
PARTICULAR. IF THAT WOULD. BE

03:57:19.391 --> 03:57:26.065
MAKE AWARDS TO. WE DO KNOW THAT

03:57:26.131 --> 03:57:26.832
FROM THE PRICE WHAT AND SOME OF

03:57:26.899 --> 03:57:29.001
OUR OTHER LONGER PRO THAT WITH

03:57:29.068 --> 03:57:29.568
FOR EXAMPLE PARTY THE PRIOR

03:57:29.635 --> 03:57:31.170
WHAT WITH SOME HEALTH LOAN

03:57:31.236 --> 03:57:33.639
ASSUMPTION WE KNOW THAT THE OLD

03:57:33.706 --> 03:57:36.809
EASE DID STAY A WE NEED TO DO

03:57:36.875 --> 03:57:38.010
WORK TO DO MORE ALONG THE RURAL

03:57:38.077 --> 03:57:39.445
FALL UP THE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE

03:57:39.511 --> 03:57:41.180
REALLY POTS WHERE A LARGE

03:57:41.246 --> 03:57:43.315
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE

03:57:43.382 --> 03:57:44.183
MADE A WORDS TO ARE STILL

03:57:44.249 --> 03:57:45.618
PRACTICING IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:57:45.684 --> 03:57:49.622
SYSTEM AFTER THEIR- SERVICE

03:57:49.688 --> 03:57:52.358
COMMITMENT. WITH REGARD TO LET

03:57:52.424 --> 03:57:54.727
HIM PROGRAM THESE OFF SERVICE

03:57:54.793 --> 03:57:57.429
BY A- AND A- TOOL AND THEY HAVE

03:57:57.496 --> 03:58:00.733
IT TOO. IN WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE

03:58:00.799 --> 03:58:02.334
A VERY HIGH PRO COMPLETION

03:58:02.401 --> 03:58:03.869
RIGHT SO WE'D BE A VERY FEW

03:58:03.936 --> 03:58:05.604
PEOPLE THAT PREACH THE PEOPLE

03:58:05.671 --> 03:58:06.605
WHO MAKE AWARDS TO COMPLETE THE

03:58:06.672 --> 03:58:07.940
PROGRAM THEY COMPLETE THEIR

03:58:08.007 --> 03:58:09.508
SERVICE COMMITMENTS OF BE AT

03:58:09.575 --> 03:58:11.810
ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS- AND WE

03:58:11.877 --> 03:58:13.312
ALSO. WE HAVE NATIONAL STUDIES

03:58:13.379 --> 03:58:15.014
AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL STUDIES

03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:17.049
IT CAN SUGGEST THAT. UPWARDS OF

03:58:17.116 --> 03:58:18.651
70% OF PARTICIPANTS IN PROGRAMS

03:58:18.717 --> 03:58:20.219
LIKE OUR STATE LOAN REPAYMENT

03:58:20.285 --> 03:58:21.286
PROGRAM OR LIKE OUR STEVEN

03:58:21.353 --> 03:58:22.321
THOMPSON LOAN REPAYMENT

PROGRAM. REMAIN IN HEALTH

03:58:24.089 --> 03:58:25.424
PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS FOR

MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER FOR.

03:58:28.894 --> 03:58:30.429
AFTER FULFILLING SERVICE. SO WE

03:58:30.496 --> 03:58:31.864
DO THERE ARE NATIONAL STUDIES

03:58:31.930 --> 03:58:35.300
THAT SHOW THAT PROGRAMS LIKE

03:58:35.367 --> 03:58:35.868
OURS WORK. SOMETIMES CAN DE

03:58:35.934 --> 03:58:38.937
THESE PER THESE STUDY CAN BE

03:58:39.004 --> 03:58:40.773
COST BURDENSOME. BUT ALL THE

03:58:40.839 --> 03:58:41.874
DATA THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED

03:58:41.940 --> 03:58:46.578
THAT IMAGE WAS A PARTISAN IN

03:58:46.645 --> 03:58:48.213
AN- INFORMATION THAT SOME OF

03:58:48.280 --> 03:58:50.115
THEM. COMPLETE THE SERVICE. AND

03:58:50.182 --> 03:58:53.152
THEN LEAVE AN AREA ABOUT MEN.

03:58:53.218 --> 03:58:54.486
THE MOST OF THE BIGGEST WE'VE

03:58:54.553 --> 03:58:55.854
BEEN ABLE TO KIND SO THAT ALL.

03:58:55.921 --> 03:58:57.222
FOR OF THEM STATE NOW IT MIGHT

03:58:57.289 --> 03:58:57.990
BE A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN EACH

03:58:58.057 --> 03:58:59.458
PRO. AND WE TRYING TO MORE WORK

03:58:59.525 --> 03:59:01.860
AROUND. AND MORE LONG. STUDIES
