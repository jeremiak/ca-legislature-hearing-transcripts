EXTEND FUND IS SENATOR MINING HAS ARTICULATED TEN YEARS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP. SEA OTTER RESEARCH UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS FUND GET EXTENDED SO THAT THAT WORK CAN TAKE PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY THE RATE OF RECOVERY HAS NOT ALLOWED SEA OTTERS TO EXPAND TO THEIR- PREVIOUS HABITAT AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BAKER AND TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MISTER FINO TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR LIFE WAS AN ORIGINAL SPONSOR ON THIS BILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS TO BE AUTHOR BUT YET AGAIN. AS NOTED BY MISTER BAKER'S RAISE MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR REALLY CRITICAL PROJECTS THAT NORMALLY DON'T QUALIFY FOR BOND FUNDING SO THIS FUNDING IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR RESEARCH. AND OTHER. PROJECTS IN PARTICULAR IS ARE THEY ACTUALLY FUNDED PROJECT THAT- SHOWED HOW THE IMPORTANCE OF RESTORATION OF THE EEL GRASS AND SEAGRASS IN THE ELKHORN SLOUGH AT THE ROLE OF SEA OTTERS IN THAT RESTORATION. SO IT'S REALLY GENERATED SOME CRITICAL CRITICAL RESEARCH AND- DISCOVERIES THAT ARE HELPING WITH NOT JUST A SEA OTTERS BUT TO POLITICAL RESTORATION GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR THAT REASON WE ARE CHEN AYE THOUGH Q. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AS WELL IN WE LOVE WHEN THE SCREEN IS IN COMMITTEE THE FLOORS OR ANY OF TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MR AND MEMBERS. WE HAVE BOTH POINTS. THAT THE OWNERS NEED OUR HELP NOW MORE THAN EVER DESPITE THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE. THE MOST RECENT SURVEY IT RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA FISHING DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE U. S. G. S. FOUND. THAT THE THREE YEAR AVERAGE POPULATION INDEX OF SEA OTTERS OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST HAD DROPPED 220-009-0060 TWO INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS A DECLINE FROM THE RECENT HIGH OF THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO AUTRES IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY. THE HIGHEST NUMBER RECORD SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. OBVIOUSLY STILL DRASTICALLY LOWER THAN THE HISTORIC POPULATION. SO WE THINK THESE FUNDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND DR- THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM.

PART OF THIS BILL DOES CHANGE NAME CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW PASSED LAST YEAR IT SPECIFIES THAT IT IS A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION. IN JUST A FINAL NOTE. ONE OF THE WITNESSES REFERENCE THE EEL GRASS RESTORATION IN ALCORN LOU. WE FOCUS ON THE SEA OTTER PRESERVATION IN THIS BILL THERE REALLY PART OF A BROADER ECOSYSTEM IN IN MANY WAYS THE- CANARY IN THE COAL MINE SO WE LEARN. ABOUT THE BROADER ECOSYSTEM AS WE TRACK SEA OTTER SURVIVAL OR WHERE THEY'RE THREATENED- AND WE KNOW THE DEAL GRASS RESTORATION VITAL TO THE SEA OTTER. IS ALSO VITAL TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION SO. WE'RE IN A CONNECTED ECOLOGY THE SEA OTTERS GIVE US- A REAL IMPORTANT FOCAL POINT. TO PROTECTING THE BROADER ECOLOGY AS WELL AS THE SURVIVAL. OF THE SEA OTTER POPULATION AND ALSO CRITICAL TO OUR TOURISM. IN MANY OF THE COASTAL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIANS PRISM ECONOMY. CREATES JOBS. IS REVENUES. IT'S THE SEA OTTERS.

SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO COMMITTEE WE WELCOME CENTERS TO- THE COMMITTEE AND WE WELCOME. IS WELL. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE MCGUIRE MEMBERS REALLY PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THIRTY SEVEN TO YOU TODAY SB THIRTY SEVEN IS A MECHANISM TO INCENTIVIZE CORPORATIONS THAT DO BIG IN CALIFORNIA AND NOTE THAT IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BASED CORPORATIONS. RATHER CORPORATION TO DO BUSINESS. WE NEED TO PAY THE FEAR SHE EMPLOYEES THE GOAL OF SB THIRTY SEVEN IS TO SHRINK INCOME INEQUALITY. AND INCOME INEQUALITY IS NO LONGER IN AND DISCUSSED ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE STARK REALITY. OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE US. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT RECORD HIGHS UNEMPLOYMENT IS RECORD LOW YET THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR BETWEEN WEALTHY CEOS AND THE AVERAGE WORKER THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE KEEPS WIDENING. THE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS THAT MOST OF OUR PARENTS AND SOME OF US. WORKED A FEW DECADES AGO NO LONGER PROVIDE A FAMILY WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND THE MORE HOURS YOU WORK FOR THE HARDER YOU WORK RARELY TRANSLATES NOW TO A GREATER REWARD OR SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. INCOME INEQUALITY IN U. S. IS NOW THE MOST EXTREME THAT IT'S BEEN IN A CENTURY SINCE THE GILDED AGE AND OUR TOP 1% TWELFTH THE INDIVIDUALS IN AMERICA HOLDS ABOUT 40% OF THE ENTIRE NATION'S WEALTH. AND IN OUR OWN CITIES UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE IT WHEN CONSTITUENTS THE BARS WORK FULL TIME JOBS BUT CAN NOT AFFORD AN ADDRESS WHERE THEIR W. TWO CAN BE MAILED TO. MANY OF THEM THESE FIRST WITH FULL TIME JOBS ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS OR COUCH SURFING AND SOME UNFORTUNATELY EVEN ON THE STREETS. WE NOW CALIFORNIA HAS THE FOURTH BIGGEST GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR IN THE NATION. NOW OUR BIG CORPORATIONS ARE ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF THIS PROBLEM NOT ONLY BUT ONE. C. E. O. PAY OF CORPORATIONS HAS SKY ROCKETED NEARLY 1000% IN THE PAST FOUR DECADES YET THE PAY OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EMPLOYEE HAS REMAINED MOSTLY STAGNANT SINCE THE SEVENTIES OF COURSE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. SO IN THE SEVENTIES YOUR COMPANY BOSS TOOK HOME ROUGHLY THIRTY TIMES MORE THAN THE RIVER EMPLOYEE BUT TO DATE THE LONG RANGE OF CEO PAY TO EMPLOYEE PAY IS ONE HALF TIMES THE AVERAGE. IS THREE HUNDRED TIMES WITH. MANY COMPANY COCA COLA MANY OTHERS AREUPWARDS TO A THOUSAND TIMES AND HIGHER. SO SB THIRTY SEVEN IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY WE'VE DONE WELL IN CALIFORNIA BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE NOW THERE'S CONFRONTING THE FACT THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT ADEQUATE YES OF HIGH PRICE OF LIVING. BUT HE- OUR FOUR YEARS HELP SHARE THIS BURDEN NO I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A BURDEN IT'S NOT A BURDEN BECAUSE INVESTING IN EMPLOYEES HELPS THE ECONOMY OVERALL IF THE EMPLOYEES ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY AND CARING LESS DEBT THAN THEIR BUYING THE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES ARE MAKING IN PRODUCING SO SB THREE SEVEN IS DOES NOT BIND TO PRECISE SAID DRESSED JUST. QUICKLY SAY WHAT NOW WE GET BY WITH THIS. COULD HAVE DESIGNED IT SB THIRTY SEVEN TO BE RICH REVENUE NEUTRAL AND THE- LAST HAVE A PROGRESSIVE CHANGE TO THE TAX RATE. SO THAT WE PERHAPS LOWERED THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE. IN THAT RANGE OF THIRTY THIRTY TIMES CO PAYDIRT WORKER PAY- AND THEN PROGRESSIVELY RAISED IT BASED ON THAT AMOUNT SO THAT THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE WOULD BE IN FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THOSE CORPORATIONS- THOUSAND TIMES AND HIGHER. NOW THE REASON THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE REVENUE AND HAS A BASE RATE OF THE CORPORATIONS THAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA BASE RATE INCREASE IS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT CORPORATIONS JUST RECEIVED WHEN ALL TAX CUT IN OUR PARKING NOW FAR MORE MONEY THAN DID THE PREVIOUS MONTH THAT OTHERWISE. TO THE ART. AND THE ONLY TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA YEAH IN CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. RBC PLEA PAYING THE COST FOR THE SERVICES THAT EMPLOYEES THEN TURN TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A WAGE THAT CAN PROVIDE THEIR FAMILY'S NEEDS SO WE SEE AVERY BIG INCREASE IN CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON MEDI CAL FOR DEPENDENT ON- VARIOUS OF OUR SOCIAL SERVICES. ON CAL FRESHER FOOD STAMP PROGRAM THOSE KIND OF THINGS SO IT'S DESIGN NOW. TO RESET BASED THREE BRING IN SOME NEW REVENUE BUT IT COULD JUST AS WELL BE DESIGNED TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL. WE INCENTIVIZE AT. INCREASE TO GET EMPLOYEES NOW AS I MENTIONED THE BILL A FAX. CORPORATIONSTHAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S ALSO DESIGNED ONLY FOR THOSE THAT. POST A TEN MILLION IN TAXABLE INCOME FROM THE BUSINESSES THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ONLY POINT 002% TOTAL CORPORATIONS NATIONWIDE OR ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SO THIS ONLY AFFECTS THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO THE DESIGN INVEST THIRTY SEVEN BEFORE YOU TODAY RECOGNIZES THAT RELIANCE ON STATE SERVICES INCREASES WHEN CORPORATIONS UNDER PAY THEIR WORKERS. RAISING THAT BASE RATE ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT CORPORATE INCOME TAX IN CALIFORNIA AS A PORTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND HAS FALLEN TO LESS THAN 9% OF OUR TOTAL GENERAL FUND COMPARED TO WHEN IT WAS ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES WHEN WE FIRST HAVE TO INTRODUCE I'M MISS ABIGAIL DISNEY WHO WILL BE MY PRIMARY WITNESS AND THEN FOLLOWING ABIGAIL DISNEY WILL BE THE HEAD OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE LABOR FEDERATION ART PULASKI. BUT SHOULD AT SENATOR N. S. DISNEY WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE UP TO SEVEN MINUTES AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT AS YOU GET CLOSE TO THAT SEVEN IN THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD MORNING. AND I'M GONNA SPEAK FAST. YOUR GOOD CARE MANY MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK I'M ADVOCATE DISNEY. MY GRANDFATHER WAS ROY O. DISNEY WHO CO FOUNDED THE COMPANY NEARLY A CENTURY OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NEARLY A CENTURY AGO. NO I DON'T SPEAK IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY BUT I AM SOMEONE WHO CARRIES THE NAME AROUND. IS THE NAME THAT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ASSOCIATE WITH ALL OF THE HIGHEST ASPIRATIONS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WENT TO ANAHEIM IS BOOKED TO DISNEYLAND WORKERS. HONESTLY SELDOM DOES A MORAL IMPERATIVE. PRESENTED WITH KIND OF CLARITY THAT IT DID THAT FOR ME THAT DAY. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I WAS TAUGHT BY MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TO RESPECT. THEY WORK HARD ALL DAY LONG FOR A COMPANY THAT IS HISTORICALLY PROFITABLE. IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH AND YET AT THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH THEY'RE PAID SO POORLY. THAT THEY RELY ON FOOD BANKS. SLEEPING CARS OR LIVE SO CLOSE TO THE BONE THE EVEN THE SMALL PROBLEM COULD SEND THEM INTO A DEATH SPIRAL. SO LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT DISNEY. AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT DISNEY CEO. THIS IS A PROBLEM OF CORPORATE CULTURE FIFTY YEARS IN THE MAKING. THE RESULT OF A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN TO CONVINCE BUSINESS PEOPLE PUNDITS POLITICIANS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT UP IS FOUND. WRONG IS RIGHT AND MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT GREED IS GOOD. FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY GRANDFATHER RAN THE COMPANY THE CEO PAY RATIO WAS ROUGHLY TWENTY TO ONE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCORDING THE INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES FIFTY U. S. CORPORATIONS HOW TO PAY RATIO OF OVER A THOUSAND. THAT LIST INCLUDES SOME OF AMERICA'S MOST ICONIC COMPANIES LIKE WALMART AND MCDONALD'S IN THE APTLY NAMED THE GAP WHERE IT'S AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. AMONG STANDARD POOR'S FIRMS NEARLY THAN ONE HUNDRED TIMES THERE MEDIAN WORKER PAY AND NEARLY POVERTY LINE FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR. IN THE FORTY YEARS DURING WHICH CEO PAY HAS BLOWN BY OVER ENOUGH TO COVER SKYROCKETING COSTS THAT THINGS LIKE EDUCATION HOUSING AND HEALTH CARE I KNOW YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE OF THESE FACTS. THE SOCIAL MOBILITY OF WHICH MY GRANDFATHER AND GREAT UNCLE WERE EXEMPLARS HAS ALL BUT EVAPORATED. PRAGMATIC REASONS TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. REALLY PAID EMPLOYEES ARE LESS PRODUCTIVE HAVE LOWER MORALE AND HIGHER RATES OF TURNOVER AND I CAN'T THINK OF THE BUSINESS THAT NEEDS GOOD MORALE OF MORE THAN DISNEY DOES COMPANIES WITH HIGH PAY GAP SPEND LESS ON OUR ANTI TAKE RECKLESS RISKS AND SUFFER FROM SHORT TERM ISM BUT ABOVE ALL. THIS IS A MORAL QUESTION. SHOULD NOT THE EVERYDAY CONSIDERATIONS TAKE A BACKSEAT TO THE FACT. THAT SIGNIFICANT SEGMENTS OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE DROWNING. WHILE THE REST OF US ARE DINING AT THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE REFUSING TO THROW THEM SO MUCH AS A LIFE JACKET. THERE IS NOTHING INHERENTLYWRONG. WITH BEING WELL PAID FOR DEMANDING AND REALLY AT WORK JUST SO LONG AS THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR YOU. ON TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE SUCCESS FOR WHICH YOU'RE BEING PRAISE ARE BEING REWARDED FAIRLY. SO WHO PICKS UP THE BILL WHEN THE WORKERS CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET WE DO THE TAXPAYERS THEY SUBSIDIZE THINGS LIKE THE FOOD BANKS AND THE HEALTH CARE IN THE HOUSING.% THAT WORKERS HAVE TO TURN TO. AS A REBUTTAL DISNEY OFTEN POINTS TO IS A SPIRE PROGRAM IT'S A GREAT EDUCATION PROGRAM I HAVE NO CRITICISM OF IT BUT IN ORDER TO ASPIRE TO BETTER TOMORROW. YOU DO HAVE TO GET TODAY. WHAT'S MORE ALL THE EDUCATE IN IN THE WORLD WON'T GET YOUR FLOOR SCRIPT. IF YOU ARE UNWILLING TO SCRUB THEM YOURSELF AND IF YOUR ENTIRE REPUTATION AS A COMPANY RELIES ON THE IDEA OF ITS CLEAN FLOORS. YOU HAD BETTER BE WILLING TO PAY YOUR WORKERS ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB WELL AND WITH DIGNITY. DIDN'T ANY IS NOT A PERK. SO IF YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR WORKERS SEND TO BETTER PAYING JOBS IN THE FUTURE THAT'S GREAT IT DOESN'T RELIEVE YOUR OF YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY THEM FAIRLY FOR WHAT THEY DID TODAY. SOME CONTENT. I DON'T LIKE THEIR PAY THEY SHOULD JUST GO FIND OTHER JOBS. BUT THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO WHEN EVERY OTHER EMPLOYEE SHARES DISNEY'S VIEW. THAT WORKERS ARE AN INFINITELY REPLENISHING SUPPLY OF NAMELESS FACELESS SPARE PARTS. WE SHOULD ALWAYS AND ONLY BE PAID AS LITTLE AS THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS. BRITAIN UNANIMITY ON THIS BORDERS ON POLLUTION THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE MARKET WHEN THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE FOR WORKERS TO GO. THIS IS WHY I'M SPEAKING OUT FOR SB THIRTY SEVEN IT WOULD BE NICE TO IMAGINE THE CORPORATIONS WOULD ALL BE NICE. AND DO THIS VOLUNTARILY BUT I THINK WE CAN BE CERTAIN THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CALLS A JOB KILLER AND IT DEFIES ALL LOGIC I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT WOULD BE A JOB KILLER. EVEN COME WITH MORE MONEY TO INVEST IN HIGH. IN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT'S NONSENSE A TAX CODE IS AS MUCH A STATEMENT OF SHARED VALUES AS A WAY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO GENERATE REVENUE SOMETIMES IT USES CARROTS LIKE TAX BREAKS FOR CORPORATE BEHAVIOR THAT BENEFITS AT ALL AND ALL I AM ALL FOR THAT. BUT WHEN FIFTY THREE MILLION WORKERS EARN BARELY ENOUGH TO LIVE AND C. SUITE EXECUTIVES CONTINUE TO BUILD AND REINFORCE THE STRUCTURE THAT CREATE THESE PROBLEMS IT'S TIME TO BRING OT THE STICKS. THIS IS A COMPLEX HISTORICAL PROBLEM AND IT WON'T BE SOLVED IN ANY SINGLE MATCHER BUT SB THIRTY SEVEN IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT. MUCH AT SOME MONEY WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU HANG THERE WITH US AND SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE JUST A BIT THAT COULD TAKE CARE OF SOME HOUSEKEEPING BEFORE WE GO TO MISS KLASKY JUST WANNA INSURED SENATOR YOU ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL MEN'S YES I DO AND APOLOGIES FOR NOT OPENING WITH NO YOU YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH WAS PLUS GIVE THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR YOU HAVE. FOUR MINUTES HE WAS SHERMAN. REMEMBER THE COMMITTEE AND MARK PULASKI. CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN ADDITION TO WHAT TOM THE AUTHOR SAID ABOUT. HE INCOME IN THE CAR. CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR SUFFERS FROM THE WITH ANY OF MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND THE SB THIRTY SEVEN GIVES AN INCENTIVE FOR COMPANIES TO STOP OR AT LEAST SLOW DOWN THIS GROWING GAP. OUR OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS GOING GAP BETWEEN CEO COMPENSATION AND WORKERS PAY. WE GREW PETER DRUCKER PREACH THE MAXIMUM EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SHOULD BE. AT AROUND SHOULD TOP OFFERED TWENTY TIMES THE WORK OF THE AVERAGE WORKER'S WAGES THAT TWO HUNDRED TIMES A THREE HUNDRED TIMES A HUNDRED TIMES THOUSAND TIMES BUT TODD TWENTY TIMES THE AVERAGE WORKER PAYS WHAT. WHAT COMPENSATION SHOULD TOP OFF AT. CORPORATIONS NOW ENJOY THE LOWER SHARE OF TAXES IN FORTY YEARS. OFFICE OF THE STORED AND WORKERS INCOMES HAVE STAGNATED. DELL DELL'S ANOTHER GROUP WHO SUPPORTS STRONG CORPORATE PROFITS. ADMITS THE PAY DISPARITY IS QUOTE A SERIOUS VERY SERIOUS SOCIETAL PROBLEM. AS WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT HIS IS NOT UP TO HIM. THERE WAS ECHOED BY THE RECENT RECENTLY BY THE CEO OF UBER WE SAID THAT WE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. BUT ALSO SAID THAT- HE SECOND DOING ABOUT IT IS UP TO SOCIETY TO DO IT. BUT WE ARE THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF SOCIETY HERE IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING. MANY. MANY OF BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ASSUME THAT- OR FORESEE THAT THE NEXT RECESSION IS AROUND THE CORNER. WHEN IT HITS WITH THIS PIECE THIRTY SEVEN OF THE FACT. FOR YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. WE CAN CREATE MORE SUSTAINABLE JOBS BECAUSE WE GIVE THOSE WORKERS THE PURCHASING POWER TO KEEP OUR ENGINE GOING. SB THIRTY SEVEN WERE GIVEN INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGES BETTER WORKER PAY OVER EXCESSIVE CEO COMPENSATION. TO LOWER THE TAX RATE FOR COMPANIES WHO NARROW THE GAP OF INEQUALITY FOR THEIR WORKERS AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY GREAT FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH HER GRAVE OF YOUR TESTIMONY BUT WE LIKE TO BE TO DO NOW IS OPEN IT UP TO THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME ALONG WITH YOUR STATION WE WELCOME YOU AND WISH YOU HAPPENING.

ALL RIGHT. BUT WE NOW WOULD LIKE ME TO DO IS TRANSITION TO OPPOSITION. WE'RE GONNA ASK THAT ARE TWO WITNESSES MAKE WAY FOR- WITNESSES WHO ARE OPPOSE WILL ASK OUR WITNESSES TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK AFTER OPPOSITION SPEAKS. I AM ARE EQUAL TIME WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE PRIMARY ONE PRIMARY. NOT TO EXCEED SEVEN MINUTES IN UP TO SECONDARY NOT TO EXCEED FOUR MINUTES EACH. ALL RIGHT. WHO IS GOING TO BE OUR PRIMARY OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING SIR IF YOUR MIND IS INTRODUCING YOURSELF THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS PROMPT AS YOU GET CLOSE THAT SEVEN WELCOME TO COMMITTEES GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS PETER BLOCKER CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND ALSO REPRESENT A LOT COALITION OF TAXPAYERS WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SB THIRTY SEVEN. HOUSE OF TAX INCREASE. ON MORE THAN DOUBLE THE STATE'S CORPORATE TAX OF FOR SOME EMPLOYERS. HOWEVER IT'S NOT JUST THE INCREASE THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS BUT THE NOVEL WAY IN WHICH ECHOES ABOUT. RAISING THE RATES. SO EXAMINE HOW THE BILL WORKS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE SIGNIFICANCE IN CONTEXT OF JUST HOW LARGE. A TAX INCREASE THIS WOULD BE. IF THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME IS OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S TAX RATE GOES GOES UP RIGHT OFF THE BAT 25% AND THIS IS BEFORE ANY COMPENSATION RATIOS ARE CONSIDERED. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE TAXPAYERS PAY ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF ALL CORPORATE TAX REVENUE IN THE STATE REVENUE SOURCE THAT IS INCREASED- EVERY NEARLY EVERY YEAR OUTSIDE OF RECESSION ADVANCE. SO ALL THESE TAXPAYERS WOULD HAVE A TEN POINT 84% RATE WE SHOULD GET CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT NEARLY THE HIGHEST STATE IMPOSE CORPORATE TAX FREE IN THE U. S. FROM THEIR COMPANIES TAX RATE CAN INCREASE. ANYWHERE FROM UP TO FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT. BASED ON THE RATIO. THIS RATE ALONE WHEN NEARLY DOUBLE THE STATE'S CURRENT RATING WOULD BE THE HIGHEST IT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST IN THE U. S. THEN WHEN YOU ADD ON THE PERSON. ALREADY COMPANIES US WORKFORCE. ONE CREASING CONTRACT WORKERS ARE FOR EMPLOYEES. CALIFORNIA'S TOP RATE WOULD NOT JUST BE THE HIGHEST IN THE US WITH A TWENTY TWO. POINT 26% RATE BUT IT ALL BUT THIS WOULD EXCEED THE AVERAGE RATES OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHICH IS SPECIALLY DISADVANTAGE AT A DISTANCE JUST A BIG A BIG DISADVANTAGE FOR STATE THE PROBABLY COMPETES GLOBALLY. COULD ALSO THAT WHEN EXAMINING THE 50% INCREASE PROVISION IT'S NOT HARD COPY EXAMPLES WHERE. THIS WOULD APPLY TO SITUATIONS NOT NECESSARILY INTENDED BY THE AUTHOR. FOR EXAMPLE A COMPANY COULD HAVE A PRODUCT THAT SUCCESSFUL ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD. SO IT OPENS UP MORE RETAILERS MORE RETAIL STORES MANUFACTURING OR THINGS THERE- AND THAT IS A TOTAL SEPARATE EITHER FINANCIAL VAN NATURAL. THE EVENT FEDERAL INTERVENTION SOMETHING HAPPENS- IN THE U. S. AND IT COULD CAUSE A DECREASE EMPLOYEES- THERE ARE CERTAIN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT. THAT A COMPANY WOULD THEN BE PENALIZED BY 50% HIGH- HIGHER RATE. WHEN IT MAY BE IN A SITUATION THAT IT'S ACTION NEEDS HELP BECAUSE IT'S NOT DOING WELL. ON TOP OF THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD STATES IN THERE. THE BILL. IN REFERENCING THIS PROVISION THAT THE THAT QUOTE THIS COULD RAISE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AND OF THE FOREIGN COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE IT COULD APPEAR TO IMPROPERLY FAVOR U. S. ACTIVITY OVER FOREIGN COMMERCE. DESPITE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE LET'S ASSUME THIS IS THAT THIS BECOMES THIS IS LAW AND IT'S LEGAL- THESE COMPANIES TAX RATES GO UP AS A RESULT OF THE BILL. I'M THE QUESTION IS WOULD CEO PAY ACTUALLY GO DOWN. AND NOT ACCORDING TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY- THERE IN THE CITY IS THEANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THE CITY PORTLAND IMPLEMENTED A VERY SIMILAR- MEASURE AND- AN ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO NO EVIDENCE THAT THE LIGHT ANY IMPACT ON CEO. COMPENSATION THERE. AND ALSO JUST AS A REMINDER LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA CONFORM TO A PIECE. OF FEDERAL TAX LAW THAT REMOVED THE DEDUCTION FOR EXECUTIVE PAY. INCLUDING PERFORMANCE PAY THUS PENALIZING COMPANIES THE MORE THEY PAY THEIR HIGHEST PAID EXECUTIVES. WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TOWARDS THIS GOAL LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS AGO. SO THEN WHO FEELS THE PAIN OF TAX INCREASES LIKE THIS TAX INCREASES LIKE THESE USUALLY OFTEN FALL EMPLOYEES AND CONSUMERS. I TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TAX FOUNDATION STUDY FOUND THAT THE CORPORATE TAX FALLS PROBABLY ON LABOR WHICH A GROUP ESTIMATES BEARS AT LEAST 70% OR IF NOT ALL OF THE BURDEN. AT SOME POINT TAX INCREASES ON BUSINESS IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS THROUGH LAST ECONOMIC GROWTH LOWER WAGES HIGHER PRICES FEWER JOBS OR DECREASE RETURNS IN RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION THESE PROBLEMS THIS TAX BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND PROBLEMATIC TO IMPLEMENT. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT IT WOULD TAKE THE F. T. B. WOULD TAKE UP TO BE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT THEY LIKELY DO NOT HAVE IN ORDER TO COLLECT ADMINISTER THE TAX. AND TAX CARE. AND THE TAXPAYERS SIDE COMPLAINTS WOULD BE NOTHING SORT OF SHORT OF A NIGHTMARE. ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO CALCULATE COMPENSATION RATIO. AS GREENHOUSES ALSO NOTES CORPORATIONS HAVE COMPLEX TAX RETURNS THAT CAN INCLUDE THOUSANDS OF US SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES AROUND THE ORLD. AND INVOLVE COMPLEX UNITARY GROUP DETERMINATIONS AND APPORTIONMENT COMPUTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY THESE COMPANIES REGULARLY CREATE MERGING DISSOLVE NEW AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES AND THROUGH ALL OF THIS THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FIND A SINGLE MEDIAN SPARE. AND THIS IS IN AN EVER CHANGING CUP CLIMB- FROM DAY TO DAY FOR- BUSINESSES. AND YET TO BE WITHIN HAVE TO VERIFY THE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO VERIFY EACH OF THESE MILLION TAXPAYERS WHO THEY ARE- THEY WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO PERFORM AN AUDIT. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT THE TAXPAYER FELT LIKE THEY WERE LIKE THERE'S- RATE WAS- INCORRECTLY DETERMINED. THEY COULD FILE- FILE FOR A CLAIM FOR REFUND WHICH WOULD. AGAIN INCREASE THE COMPLIANCE COSTS AND WORK FOR AT TO BE. UNTIL FINALLY WE CONSIDERING SB THIRTY SEVEN ONE MAY ASK WHETHER IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL IS EVEN NECESSARY ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOVERNOR. YES OPPOSE A RECORD SETTING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET- WITH ENORMOUS SURPLUSES RECORD SPENDING FOR EDUCATION AND FOR THESE REASONS WE AFFECT RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TEST ME SIR WE'RE GRATEFUL RAN TURNED OVER TO OUR SECONDARY WITNESS SIR YOU HAVE. NO MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE HAPPY NEW YEAR AT WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY SIX SECOND POMPOUS TO GET CLOSE TO FOUR. FLOORS OR SERVE YOU CAN SENATORS YOURSELF EXCELLENT. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY MY NAME IS ROB LAPSLEY ON THE PRESENT A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE. WE REPRESENT A LARGE EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I WANT TO PUT MY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IN KIND OF A MORE SPECIFIC CONTEXT IF I COULD. HI I'M I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO DEFEND CEO PAY. WHAT I AM HERE TODAY TO DO IS TO SEND JOBS AND FUTURE JOB GROWTH. BECAUSE WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND THE MESSAGE IS SENDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AB FIVE AND YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MINIMUM WAGE AND OTHER BILLS BILLS THAT FRANKLY FROM AROUND TABLE PERSPECTIVE WE DIDN'T OPPOSE MINIMUM WAGE. FIVE WE OPPOSED AB FIVE WE SUPPORTED THE TAX CONFORMITY BUILT WE NEED WE LOOK FOR POLICIES THAT ARE GOOD BUT IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS POLICY IS GOING TO SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AGAIN OF EXACTLY WHERE CALIFORNIA IS GOING. IN TERMS OF ITS JOBS CLIMATE. WE COULDN'T SEND AWARD SIGNAL BECAUSE WHAT IT'S DOING IS AGAIN TAKE THE CEO PAY OUT OF IT WHAT IS SENDING IS A BROADER SIGNAL THE LEGISLATURE IS INTENDING TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE EVERY ASPECT OF FREE ENTERPRISE. IN THE STATE. AND PEOPLE GET. WHAT IS NOT DOING IS ITS JOB AND LOOKING AT IF THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE WE HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT OTHERS HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND LET SIT DOWN AND MODERNIZE OUR TAX STRUCTURE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LET'S HAVE AND LEAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO GO. I'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION WAS CENTER HERTZBERG REGULARLY BECAUSE WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT WE WOULD BE PART OF THAT I AM PART OF AN APPLE I HAVE A BROAD COALITION OPPOSITION'S BILL BUT I'M ALSO PART OF MOBILIZING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN OPPOSITION TO SPLIT ROLE. I'M AGAIN ANOTHER CHIU THAT EXEMPLIFIES WHY WE HAVE TO GET AT MODERNIZING OUR TAX SYSTEM. AND YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE HERE EVEN IN THE IN THIS ROOM TO DO THAT. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ON A PIECEMEAL APPROACH WITH BILLS LIKE THIS. BECAUSE OF THE BROADER IMPACT IS GOING TO HAVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S HOLE AND THEN LASTLY I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THOUGHT. YOU'RE NOW OPENING UP THE DOOR ON THESE AS A MATTER TO PRIVATE BUSINESS. WELL NO IDEA. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE BEHAVIOR PRIVATE BUSINESSES BECAUSE YOU SEE THE PRICE ON THE ON PUBLIC. COMPANIES PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE A WHOLE DIFFERENT MATTER.

ALL RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RECONVENE THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE ARE GOING TO START WITH CONVERSATION FROM THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS SHARING THE CONCERNS WE'RE GONNA START WITH A VICE CHAIR CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. I IN FOR MORTGAGE COUNTY SO I WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT. I'M A BIG IS THE LAND. PAN. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE HAD THE BANKRUPTCY THE NEW YORK TIMES HAD TO TELL EVERYBODY THAT I WAS REALLY INTO MICKEY MOUSE TIES AND- I DO HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION. OUR MISSION TO MRS DISNEY RECENTLY THERE THIS MORNING THAT I. IS BORN IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE SO I AYE BY ALL THE MEMORABILIA IF IT SAYS NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THE NINE. ACRE AN IDEA AND I BUY IT SO IT'S ALL FUN. I ALSO SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT TO. DISNEY HAS BEEN GOOD ABOUT STEALING MY STAFF MEMBERS. YEAH I LOST THAT ONE WHEN I WAS SUPERVISOR AND I JUST LAST ONE LAST WEEK- FOR MY DISTRICT OFFICE. BUT I'M I'M NOT BITTER. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG I DID NOT COME HERE TO RAISE TAX RATES SO THAT'S WHERE I'M I'M HAVING. ISSUES OF COURSE BUT JUST THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF DEALING WITH COMPENSATION ISSUES DISNEYLAND HAS BEEN USING- YOU KNOW A LOT OF- SPACE SAID THE ANAHEIM STADIUM AS WELL FOR PARKING IN AND SO THERE WE HAVE ATHLETES ARE MAKING INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF INCOME FOR THEIR SKILL SET SO THERE'S ALWAYS SOME DYNAMICS ON ON. ON THAT SO I JUST HAD A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS SENATOR JUST- THE FIRST WOULD BE LIKE WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON STOCK PRICES. OF SOME OF. THE MY DISNEY WHICH WOULD BE YOU KNOW PROBABLY IN THAT CALPERS OR CAL STIRS. PORTFOLIO AND I JUST. WONDER IF WE IF WE HAVE ANY ECONOMIC STUDIES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RAISE RATES I I'M SURE I CAN GO TO. ART LAFFER AND FIND SOME INTERESTING STUDIES BUT I. WONDER IF WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THAT. WHERE WOULD WOULD IMPACT EVEN JUST OUR COSTS THANK YOU. MISTER ROYSTER FOR THE QUESTION SO IS I THINK ALL OF US KNOW STOCK RATES ARE YOU KNOW HOW THE STOCK MARKET RESPONSE TO THINGS IS NOT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE AND ISN'T ALWAYS RATIONAL BUT DE WHAT I THINK IS THE REALLY WAY TO ANSWER THIS IS THAT THE BILL IS DESIGNED YES THE WAIT IS CURRENTLY BEFORE YOU IT DOES INCREASE THE BASE RATE. ONE LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE TAXABLE BUSINESS OF HIGHER THAN TEN MILLION IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE IS A BASE RATE INCREASE NOW THIS I OUR FIRST COMMITTEE IT CERTAINLY COULD BE DESIGNED SO THAT IT DIDN'T INCREASE THAT BASE RATE. AND IT SAID INSTEAD. YOU KNOW CORPORATIONS THAT ALL OF YOU IN THIS CATEGORY OF- DOING TEN MILLION OR MORE IN BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE A RATIO BETWEEN YOUR- I'M CEO PAY YOUR EXECUTIVE SUITE PAY AND YOUR AVERAGE. EMPLOYEE PAY OF FIFTY OR BELOW WHICH WAS EVEN HIGHERTHAN WHAT IT WAS IN THE SEVENTIES THEN YOU WILL AND YOU WILL HAVE JUST THE SAME RATE YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND IN FACT THE SENATE DID ENTERTAIN A BILL LIKE THAT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND THAT THEN WE WOULD PROGRESSIVELY RAISE IT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE. BASED ON IF YOU KEPT YOUR- YOUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CEO PAYING YOUR EMPLOYEES A LARGER AND LARGER AMOUNTS SO IN THAT KIND OF A STRUCTURE. IT'S REALLY UP TO THE CORPORATION IF THE CORPORATION WANTS TO AVOID THE HIGHER RATE. THEY COULD MODIFY THEIR THE CURRENT COMPENSATION TO THEIR EXECUTIVES SANDER AVERAGE EMPLOYEE PAY. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE NOW AS I STATED IN MY OPENING I BUILT IN THE INCREASE. BECAUSE THOSE SAME CORPORATIONS ARE THE ONES THAT RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FROM A RECENT TAX CUT THAT OTHERWISE WAS GOING TO THE IRS. AND THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT HAS NOT YET TRANSLATED INTO INCREASED PAY TO EMPLOYEES SO. WITH IT WHEN EMPLOYEES AND YOU KNOW LET'S LOOK AT CALIFORNIA WE HAVE VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT SO WE HAVE MOST OF OUR CALIFORNIANS ARE WORKING AND YET WE HAVE 25% OF PEOPLE IN VERY EXTREME POVERTY. BUT THEIR WORK IN. SO THOSE SAME PEOPLE ARE THEN USING OUR SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE ARE PAYING FOR. AND SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE TO CREATE THAT MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TAXPAYER NOW IS FUND IS HOLDING THAT BILL VERSUS THE CORPORATION. SO THAT'S WHY I DECIDED THE WAY DID BUT CERTAINLY AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE COULD HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON SINCE MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. IS TO INCENTIVIZE THE CORPORATION SHRINK INCOME INEQUALITY I AM HAPPY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS A WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS IN A BETTER WAY THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE THAT. I'M I'M CONCERNED TOO ABOUT WAGE DISPARITY WITHIN EVEN SAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE LOOK AT OUR OWN HOUSE THE LA TIMES JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO CAME OUT WITH AN ARTICLE ON THE WORKERS COMP PROVIDERS STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THIS WEEK MEETING WITH THEIR CEO WHO. I WAS REPORTED OF HAVING A SALARY OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR- WELL IN EXCESS OF WHAT OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING ARE WE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT OUR OWN HOUSE WE HAVE. YOU SEE. THAT AND WE HAVE YOU SEE COACHES FOR FOOTBALL TEAMS ARE MAKING IN EXCESS OF SIX FIGURES. HI I YOU KNOW I'M I'M JUST WONDERING HOW WE- DEAL WITH THAT WE HAVE DOCTORS IN OUR SYSTEM OF COURSE BUT- YOU WANNA TAKE. SHIFTING YOU WANT TO TAKE. THE REVENUE AND DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO. CHILD CARE AND SCHOOLS JUST LIKE IT HOW DOES IT INTERFACE THEM WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT. SO THE BILL NOW DOES NOT DEDICATE THE REVENUE THE REVENUE INCREASE WOULD GO TO THE GENERAL FUND. BUT AS WE KNOW UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT. ANY INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND A MINIMUM OF 40% AND UPWARDS GHOST FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS SO FROM THAT. PERSPECTIVE IN INCREASE REVENUE WOULD BENEFIT OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WHAT OTHER SERVICES IT BENEFITS WOULD OF COURSE THEN BE WHATEVER THE BUDGET IS ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER IT GOES TO INCREASE CHILDCARE. OR YOU KNOW ANY OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE UP TO GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET BUDGET THAT'S APPROVED. MAYBE TO MISTER LAPSLEY. BY COULD ASK A QUESTION- WE SHOULDN'T THIS BE AT LIKE A SHAREHOLDER MATTER ON HOW YOU COMPENSATED CEO AND- I'M JUST JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE SAY ABOARD AS A BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO. A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE TO THESE MMHM MULTIPLIERS THAT ARE UP TO A THOUSAND TO ONE SO CENTERED A COUPLE POINTS CERTAINLY. IT SHOULD BE A CHERYL MUCH SHAREHOLDER MATTER THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT SOME COMPANIES WILL MOVE QUICKER THAN OTHERS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE GOOD SENATOR HERE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVED A TAX CUT. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT TRANSLATE TO PAY INCREASES THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE THAT IS NOW IS THERE IS THERE IS PAY INCREASES HAPPENING THERE ALSO COMPLYING WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE. BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO. THAT'S RESIDENTS IN AUTOMATIC. A PAY INCREASE AND THEY'RE ALL PAYING FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU. IT'S A VERY AS WE KNOW. DELEGATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS AND EXECUTIVES C. SUITE EXECUTIVES IS WHAT'S BEING SAID. HI I THINK THE REAL QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE IS WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU WANT TO SEND WHAT KIND OF. JOB GROWTH CLIMATE DO WE WANT IN THE STATE WE ARE A FULL EMPLOYMENT NOW- A- THAT'S BEEN A POSITIVE SILICON VALLEY'S BEEN OVER 40% OF THAT. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN PARTICULAR FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES HI THEY CAN GO AND YOU WILL. PROBABLY NEVER KNOW. WHEN A CUT WHEN YOU START TO GET THESE KINDS. OF LAWS PASSED. SO. AGAIN WE ARE CALL AND I REQUEST IS THAT WE LOOK AT IT FROM A BROADER COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT THE POLICY THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE. EQUALLY AND THEN YOU CAN BRING THIS ISSUE INTO THAT- BUT LET'S MODERNIZE THE TAX SYSTEM LET'S NOT DO IT AGAIN IN A PIECE BY PIECE BASIS- THROUGH THE CHAIR MAY I ALLOW MY WITNESS ALSO TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. STRUCTURE ARE GREAT PLEASE. SO I'M DISEASE COMPENSATION PACKAGE- WHEN ON- UP OR DOWN VOTE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WAS REJECTED BY SHAREHOLDERS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF MADE IT A NON BINDING VOTE. SO CHIRLA GOVERNANCE IS OF VERY LIMITED WAY OF GETTING. THINGS TO CHANGE INSIDE OF COMPANIES ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY HAS BECOME THE ORDER OF THE DAY AND IN THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE ACTUALLY I COMMEND THEM FOR. THEIR STATEMENT LAST YEAR QUESTIONING THE CENTRALITY OF THE SHAREHOLDER IS THE PRIMARY AND ONLY THAT THE FISHERY OF A COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES SO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS STARTING TO ASK ITSELF SOME HARDER QUESTIONS. AND THINK ABOUT THE WAYS TO MEASURE SUCCESS BEYOND SIMPLY SHARE PRICE AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD NEWS AND FRANKLY I WORKED WITH MY FATHER. IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE- WE GOT A EISNER WHO STATE BOARD ESTATE YEAH IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING CHANGE INSIDE COMPANIES- FOR DISNEY THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE ON THE SALARY NOT THE BOARD OF. NO NO THE BOARD VOTED ON AND APPROVED IT CHERYL THIS REJECTED IT BUT IT WAS A NON BINDING VOTE. THE BOARD WAS FORCED TO GO BACK AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT CUTS AND IT WAS ONLY JUST BARELY APPROVED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WILL THEN AND DESIGNING. SOME KIND OF YOU CALL AND SENATE BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY. I ARMS AROUND THAT WORD I'D LIKE TO BE. THE CENTER FOR BUT- YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. AYBE HAVING SOME REPERCUSSIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE SB THEY HAVE A- SOMETHING AS OPPOSED TO PUNISHING THE WHOLE CORPORATION AND- THE HIGHER TAXES MAY BE PUNISHING THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES. AS A- BUT INTO A CONSEQUENCE. WELL DISNEY AND IT IS- STOCK OPTION PROGRAM MANY YEARS AGO SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY SHARE PRICE AND RIGHT NOW UNDER THE UNDER THE- BUT THE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH IS BEING RUN WHICH ARE THE CHERYL TO PRIVACY PRINCIPLES ON THE SHAREHOLDERS INTERESTS AND CEOS INTERESTS ARE TOTALLY A LOT- IN THAT ALL ANYBODY'S LOOKING FOR IS A HIGHER SHARE PRICE AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT- THAT'S NOT GONNA BRING ABOUT THE BEST AND MOST LONG TERM DECISION MAKING AND FAT THE BENEFIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMPANIES ARE SPENDING LESS ON OUR ANTI. TAKING MORE A RECKLESS RISKS ARE THINKING IN SHORT TERM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T BENEFIT BY COMPANIES MAKING THOSE KINDS OF PLACE. WE IN ALSO DRESS MY MAY WITH CARE. AS A GOVERNMENT WE ARE LIMITED IN THE WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE A CERTAIN POLICY OBJECTIVES. BUT TO ACHIEVE THEM WE HAVE TO DESIGN THINGS THAT. ARE LEGALLY THAT YOU KNOW MEET OUR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. AND WHILE I IMAGINE. BUT I'M NOT AN EXPERT AND I'M SURE IF WE WERE TO CHARGE OUR COMMITTEE WITH TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME WAYS THAT WE MIGHT DO A REQUIREMENT ON THE BOARDS OF COMPANIES. YOUR THAT IS A SPACE WHERE OUR LEGAL OPTIONS ARE. MORE LIMITED. SINCE WE DO SET THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR OUR STATE IT IS IT. DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THE ONLY WAY. BUT IT IS A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE. TO A TO TRY TO DRIVE GOOD GOOD BEHAVIOR. NOW AGAIN I RATE I SAID IN THE OPENING IS THAT THE ADDITIONAL REASON THAT I. PUT IN THE BILL THE RAISING ON THE BASE RATE IS BECAUSE WERE OUT OF PLACE TODAY. WITH CORPORATIONS THAT RECORD PROFITS WITH. BASICALLY NO ONE EMPLOYMENT AND YET 25% OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. AND AS A TOTAL PORTION OF OUR GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THIS CATEGORY OF TAX THIS CORPORATE INCOME TAX THE AMOUNT THAT A CORPORATION PAYS BASED ON THE BUSINESS THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA IS THERE ARE LOWEST POINT AS A PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND. SO I REALIZE THAT I'M TRYING TO IN THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE A NUMBER OF POLICY OBJECTIVES BUT I JUST WANT EXPLAINED THAT THAT'S WHY IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY NO I I'VE THE LAST QUESTION BE SHEET IT REAL QUICK- INTO VICE CHAIRMAN CHASSIS. BRAKE QUICKLY I THINK YOU WANT TO SAY ONE ITEM. FIVE BY MR AROUND FIVE FOR A MOMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO IT'S GONNA BE. REMINDS FRAZIER REAL QUICK AND I APOLOGIZE LAST COMING FROM THE VICE CHAIR WE HAVE THREE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SO WE'D LIKE TO BE TO GO TO NEXT SENATOR HERTZBERG THEY WERE GOING TO SIT ON THE BALLOT. AND IN SENATOR WIENER PLEASE MR BY SURE THE FULL RESOURCE. FOR THERE IS A COMPANY AND- CALIFORNIA THAT THIS STATE IS HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED THROUGH TAX CREDITS. CARPOOL STICKERS AND THAT'S TESLA. ITS C. E. O. ELON MUSK WAS- JUST I JUST QUALIFIED FOR A THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PAY OUT- JUST THE LAST FEW DAYS. I DOUBT IT THAT COMPANIES EVEN HAD A TAXABLE INCOME. TAX RETURN YET AND SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE NOT. SEVEN TAXABLE INCOME BUT WE STILL HIGHLY COMPENSATING BY SEVERE MULTIPLES A COMPANY THAT WERE ACTUALLY. SUBSIDIZING YEAH IT'S AN IRRATIONAL HISTORICAL ANOMALY THAT I THINK NEEDS ADDRESSING THERE'S NO QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF WE ADDRESS IT WITH THE SPELL I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH. BUT AS LONG AS THE VALUE OF A COMPANY AND A PERSON ARE ONLY SEEN IN TERMS OF SHARE PRICE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THIS INSIDE ARE WE JUST STATE THAT A CALCULATED ILAN MUST PERISH- IF YOU ASSUME IS MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE. FIFTEEN PERSON OUR IT'S ACTUALLY. SIXTY SIX. SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT SIX JUSTIN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO THEM AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO YEAH THIS LEGISLATURE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER NOTHING SO MUCH AS VICE CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO SEND SKINNER WITNESSES WERE NOT GONNA TURN IT OVER. TO A MAJORITY LEADERS FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ON. I DO THINK MISTER LAPS LEE THERE IS A SENSITIVITY THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE HOME. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE MADE. THAT ON ALL SIDES THE WRONG. QUESTION FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE FROM MY VIEW IS. WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS POINT IN HISTORY IN A UNIQUE SITUATION. WELL WE WILL SOON HAVE TRILLION AIRS. WHERE THERE IS A TENSION BECAUSE OF THIS DISPARITY THAT IS- DESTROYS THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT'S DEEPER THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN EVEN BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN DUST REALIZATION ALIKE THE RATE OF CHANGE THE ABILITY OF THE GLOBALIZATION LEVEL O CAPTURE CAPITAL IS EXTRAORDINARY. SO I LOOK AT THIS MEASURE NOT IN ITS PARTICULARS AND WHETHER IT'S GOING TO COST THE F. T. BE MORE MONEY ON THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OR WHATEVER GROUPS ADMINISTRATIVE. BUT I LOOK AT IT YET CONTEXT OF MODERNIZATION AND- WE USED TAXING AND THE WORK OTHER PUBLIC POLICIES AS TOOLS. AND ME FORD FAMOUSLY SAID I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY MY CAR. RIGHT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WE MENTIONED. TESLA YOU KNOW I HAVE A SECTION THIS BOOK THERE ARE MANY CALL THE TAX SUBSIDIZED HAMBURGER WE ALL WANT TO HAVE A DOLLAR HAMBURGER. FAST FOOD STORE BUT WHICH QUITE FRANKLY TAX SUBSIDIZED BY EVERYBODY UNDER THE SUN. IF WE HAD CORPORATIONS THAT RAN LIKE POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS WE WOULD ORGANIZE JANITORS AND CAFETERIA WORKERS IN THE PEOPLE THAT THE MOST. RATHER THAN INCENTIVIZE TO BUY. ON BY SHEER PROFITS RIGHT HOW TO WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE RIGHT WE ARE BECAUSE WE'D BE WE WANT THE MOST NUMBER OF VOTES VERSES MAKING THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE FEWEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE. TO THE QUESTION I LOOK AT THIS QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME OF ALIGNING CENTERS. IN MODERNIZING THIS STUFF TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GREAT EQUITY AND IF YOU LOOK IS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ENERGY IN THE ENERGY ALTERNATIVE SPACE FOR MANY YEARS AND I REMEMBER. WHEN NONE OF THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES HAD SHE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICERS NOW THEY ALL DO. I'VE SEEN THESE FUNDAMENTAL SHIPS THAT A CAR IN TERMS OF CULTURAL CHANGES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE BUSINESS. ROUNDTABLE BEGINNING TO CHANGE WHAT THEY DEEM IT YOU KNOW TAKES A WHILE THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT IF YOU LOOK IN THE VERY SHORT ORDER THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN SO I. MY JUDGMENT ON THIS IS THAT ALSO CORPS. COULD YOU. JUST MENTIONED CENTER BELL MAYBE MAKE IT A TAX REVENUE REVENUE NEUTRAL TO REWARD THE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING BETTER BEHAVIOR. I'M NOT ONLY TO THE RIGHT ANSWER. YOU KNOW. THE MONTH NOTHING FURTHER THAT IT. BEARS A AN INTELLIGENT. NON TONAL CONVERSATION THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE WE ALL NEED TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER AT A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL THAT PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT AND WHETHER IT'S THIS SORT OF TAX POLICY WOULD OTHER SORT OF TAX POLICY THE NOTION IS TO ALIGN INCENTIVES OR REMOVE DISINCENTIVES WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. COURAGE INVESTMENT TO ENCOURAGE SAVINGS TO ENCOURAGE AND AVOID THIS SMALL BOX CHRISSY IS THE TERM THAT I USE THAT WE COULD ULTIMATELY GET. BY VIRTUE OF THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL YOU KNOW FOLKS JUST CAN'T KEEP INSULATING THEMSELVES IT'S GOT IT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SOCIETY THAT WORKS IN THESE. THESE TERROR THE FABRIC OF WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT THAT THE BALANCE HAS TO EXIST. AGAIN WHAT THAT IS BUT I DO IT IN THAT SENSE THAT I THINK THAT IT'S AN HONORABLE CONVERSATION. AT THE TONE HAS TO BE RESPECTFUL OF ALL SIDES NOT THAT I'M STICKING IT TO YOU YOU'RE STICKING IT TO ME BUT WE ALL CARE ABOUT ONE THING THAT THIS DEMOCRACY WORKS OF THIS EQUITY AND FAIRNESS OF THE MARKETS ON THE ANYBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. BASICALLY MADE THAT STATEMENT IN. YOUR OLD I THINK. IS WE DEBATE THESE THINGS INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS IS WE ENGAGE IN THIS LARGER. LARGER DYNAMIC I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT IS I THINK THE LAST TEN YEARS THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF TRYING TO FIGURE. IT'S THORNBERG. YEAH ABSOLUTELY A X. ON SOME OF THE TOUGHEST ISSUES DOES THE DEEP DIVE TO BETTER BRING BACK EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BETTER TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR BELL CENTRE WINNER IN CENTER NIELSEN. SOME REPRESENTING THE AREA I DO. I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT. SILICON VALLEY ARE APPLIED TO. WAIT CORPORATE BEHAVIOR OF HERS IN MY AREA. YEAH. EITHER BENEFITS OR DOESN'T BENEFIT THE ECONOMY I THINK BENEFITING THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSION OF THE CORPORATE TO ALL INCOME TAX STRUCTURE I BELIEVE THAT. THANK ARM I BELIEVE THAT. BENEFITING ECONOMY MEANS TO ME. HIRING PEOPLE EMPLOYING PEOPLE FAIR WAGES. OUR CORPORATE PROFITS. CORPORATE GROSS. HAVING ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE STATE. SUCCESSFULLY AN IN COMPETITION WITH ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I THINK THOSE ARE PRINCIPLES YOU KNOW WHEN WE WANT A- LOOK AT THE TAXATION PRINCIPLES THAT WE SHOULD ESTABLISH FOR THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THAT. CLOSELY FAIRNESS IS A PRINCIPAL. COLLECTION IS A PRINCIPAL. BUT WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT WAY THINGS ARE NOW. I THINK THERE'S. LEAGUE CAUGHT LEAKAGE LOOPHOLES- MAYBE ENCOURAGEMENT OF SOME BEHAVIORS THAT ARE NOT MORALLY ACCEPTABLE. MORALLY ACCEPTABLE AND. I THINK ONE OF THEM IS THAT. SAU RESERVES THE INCUMBENT EXECUTIVES BASED ON MARKET CAPITALIZATION. WE'RE PART OF THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION TACTIC IS TO LAY OFF PEOPLE. I THINK IS A. MORAL DILEMMA IN THAT TAX STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE NOW SO WE WANT TO DISCOURAGE. LAYING OFF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT REINVESTMENT. IN THE BUSINESSES IN THE COMPANY- WE WANNA COURAGE OF HIRING MORE EMPLOYEES. BUT MARKET CAPITALIZATION BONUSES. AT OBSCENE LEVELS. THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS. IF THE MARKET VALUE IN THE CAPITALIZATION OF THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY GOES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LAID OFF FROM THE SAME COMPANY I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T I SEE THAT'S A- THAT'S THE DILEMMA IN THE TAX STRUCTURE. SO THE QUESTION IS. IS THIS A WAY TO. DO WITHOUT- IS JUST ONE WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT HOW DO WE DO WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN A AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LAOS. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS ECONOMY GOES SOUTH. IN CALIFORNIA THAT. RATHER THAN. CUT THE EXECUTIVE PAY. WE'RE GONNA START TO BE LAID OFF BY THESE COMPANIES. I CAN I CAN BE IN VISION OF FUTURE. WERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD GO UP. YET THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVES ARE STILL MAKING WHICH IS A- SIXTY SIX. HIGH TIMES THE MEDIAN SALARY. HELLO SO- I DON'T PARTICULARLY THINK PAYING SOMEBODY THAT I. IS GOOD I WOULD CONCLUDE THE PAYING SOMEBODY THAT AS OPPOSED TO PAYING EMPLOYEES AND KEEPING EMPLOYEES AND- REINVESTING IN THE BUSINESS AND DOING OTHER KINDS OF THINGS IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY I DON'T THINK I CAN'T. SEE HOW IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY OKAY SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE BOTH SIDES. ANSWER THE QUESTION. OF CENTER SCANNERS TRYING TO DEVISE A BILL THAT THAT. PRAISE GOOD BEHAVIOR I'VE I WOULD THINK. AND. IF GOOD RE HAVER IN THE BILL COULD YOU KNOW LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT REVENUE TO DROUGHT A- GOOD BEHAVIOR COULD BE REWARDED. IN A TAX BILL YEAH SOMEHOW. OF THAT WOULD BE A COULD NOT A SECOND QUESTION APPRECIATION ABOUT SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE LABOR FORCE IN OUR STATE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GETTING ADEQUATE. AND BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THEY DON'T I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. WE THE TAXPAYER HAVE TO PICK UP. SOME CARE IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I JUST A QUICK STAB AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE OPPOSITION ALSO ANSWERED YEAH ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE'RE **** IN SKINNER- JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT A YES WE ABSOLUTELY GREAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY. ON THE. I REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR VALUE POINTING THIS OUT BECAUSE- THE- THE OTHER WAY AND I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH BUT THE OTHER WAY THIS BILL. IS DESIGNED IN AGAIN DRIVER PERFECT DESIGN NO AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THESE KINDS OF HEARINGS AND OUR WHOLE. PROCESS COULD HELP US. NO I'M DESIGN SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR WILL RETURN OF CHIEF BUT- HAVING. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH IN ADEQUATE INCOMES AND HIGH DEBTS IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO OUR ECONOMY. THEY ARE NOW WORKING SO WE'VE NOT KILL JOBS THERE HAS BEEN JOB GROWTH HE'S CALIFORNIANS ARE WORKING. BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT BECAUSE THEIR WAGES ARE LOW. AND A THE EXECUTIVE SUITE MAKING THE- WIND SHEAR OF THE WAGES WHILE I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST PEOPLE BEING RICHER MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. THAT IS NOT REINVESTED IN THE CAR TO MEET THE SAME WAY THAT. A LARGER NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING THAT HAVE MORE MONEY AND SPENDING IN THE ECONOMY DOES RIGHT SO. HARD THIS IS ALSO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT. WE KNOW THAT OUR TAX STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE TAXES. IN HIGH SALES TAXES IS MOST VULNERABLE IF WE HAVE A RECESSION. HAPPEN PEOPLE WITH BETTER WAGES WILL HIT IS IT JUST GIVES US A LITTLE MORE RECESSION SECURITY YOUR INSURANCE. NO THANK YOU ABBAS MIGHT EXPONENT ADD ONE THING AND THEN. ARTICLES WELL I JUST WANTED TO OFFER RIGHT I THINK THAT- OF RULE OF AROUND CEO COMPENSATION MIGHT BE ON THAT YOU THINK OF HIM AS OF FOR HER IN RARE CASES. THEY'RE MORE CEO'S NAMED JOHN THAN THERE ARE WOMEN CEOS BUT- BUT AS THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN. AND SAW THAT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY ON THE SHIP AND HE'S WELCOME TO A SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS LONG AS PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOR HIM ARE NOT HAVING TO GO TO THE FOOD BANK TO MAKE THEIR BASIC NUTRITION. NEEDS ME. THIS IS A WE'RE GONNA GO TO COLLAPSE THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SAFE YOU WORDS ON THIS AS WELL SIR YES JUST A QUICK POINT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE WE- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL. COMMENTS HERE TODAY. AND THOSE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS REFLECT THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT. IS TRYING TO TAKE A MORE SIMPLE APPROACH TO ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WE FACE ON ALL FRONTS AND I SAY THAT VERY RESPECTFULLY. HI BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NOT ENOUGH TO PAY. FOR LOWER LEVEL EMPLOYEES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT. THEY CAN'T AFFORD A HOME BECAUSE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THAT A C. E. O. OR A COMPANY'S FAULT IT'S NOT. I THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BROADER ISSUES AT PLAY IN CALIFORNIA SOCIETY. THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OR NOT PASSED DAD WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THAT'S NO ONE'S FAULT THAT'S ALL PART OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN A DYNAMIC SOCIETY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW THEY- THE ABILITY TO TRY AND REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR SOCIETY THROUGH OUR TAX CODE NEEDS TO AGAIN BE MODERNIZED IN A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH IN SITTING DOWN AND IF IT IS THE INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REFLECT VALUES THAT INTEND TO GET AT ESSENTIALLY ANOTHER TAX INCREASE ON SEALS AND LET'S SAY THAT AND THEN LET'S BUILD IT. AND THEN LET'S LOOK AT HOW ELSE. WE CAN CREATE BALANCE SO WE ENSURE LONG TERM JOB GROWTH. THAT'S THE KEY. AND SO- DATA AGAIN MEMBERS WILL IS WHAT WE ASK FOR TODAY NOT A YOU KNOW NOT PIECEMEAL APPROACH SO BUT WE APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION IT IS A- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION WELL LOW. IN MY AREA WE ARE SERVICE- PROBABLY THE LEADER OF. THE MANUFACTURING GROUPS WHEN I WAS ON THE. INVOLVED IN CREATING THE HIGHWAYS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THE WAS PARTNER WITH THE. NEWMAN HIS PARTNER. I WAS WHO WOULDN'T PACKARD. THEY HAD A THEY HAD A RULE CALL THE ATTACKER GOLDEN RULE. AND THE GOLDEN RULE WAS. DID YOU GET A JOB PACKARD NEW PERFORMED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB EVER. WE WILL ALL LEASE I WILL I WILL PROMISE YOU IS EXACTLY THAT OUR COMPANIES GOING TO GROW AND I'M GOING TO REINVEST IN THE COMPANY AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO. PAY ADEQUATE WAGES TO THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME AND TREAT HIM AS- CAPTAIN THE SHIP PART OF MY FAMILY. THAT WAS THE ETHIC THAT THEY HAVE SO I DON'T THINK THE CORPORATE TAX CODE HAS TO BE. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME PRINCIPLES I THINK IT HAS TO. MORAL OF THOSE I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A MORAL. SO I THINK WE ARE THAT WE AUTO LIMóN EIGHT. THOSE PARTS OF IT THAT ARE NOT GOING IN TWO DIRECTIONS THAT I THINK IN MY OPINION VIOLATE THE GOLDEN RULE. THE GOLDEN RULE YOU STAB IN THEIR COMPANY. AND IT WAS A LASTING RULE TO THE FAMILY LEFT TO THE LEFT OF. SO I TAKE A OF I TAKE. THOSE ARE KIND OF OLD SCHOOL KIND OF PHILOSOPHIES I HAVE BUT I THINK THEY'RE GOOD ONES I THINK THE BUSINESSES AND SILICON VALLEY. HAVE SOMEONE. TIMES. THIS RULE AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO. INTO TO INSIST ON REINVESTMENT. HIRING EMPLOYEES. NOT BEING SO SENSITIVE TO THE STOCK PRICE OF THE WEEK. AND THE TAXI CAN QUOTE THE TAXATION CODE. SHOULD. HAVE SOME REFLECTION ON THAT IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE SET IT UP. EMPLOYEES PLEASE OUR MOST VALUED IN THE PACKARD GOLDEN RULE. THANK YOU SIR ABOUT VERY VERY GRATEFUL- IT JUST OUT OF FAIRNESS THAT WE HAD TO SPEAK ORIGINALLY TO MISTER BELL WE HAD A SERVICE SKINNER MRS NAMES BLOCKER WAS OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ON THAT. JUST THAT WE ALSO ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT. WE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO LAYOFFS AND TO YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THAT. YEAH WE CAN THAT. WE CAN KEEP OUR OUR WORKFORCE EMPLOYED. AND WITH RESPECT FOR THIS BILL I THINK OUR OUR DIFFERENCES THAT WE FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT THE BEST THE BEST APPROACH TO DO THAT ALTHOUGH WE TOTALLY SHARE THE SENTIMENT THAT- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SAME GOALS WE JUST THINK THERE MAY BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD COME ALONG WITH THIS THAT MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CAUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER TO CENTER WINNER AND WE'D LIKE TO TURN THE FLORIDA CENTER NUISANCE AND WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN I. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- EMISSIONS THE PURSUING THIS LEGISLATION. I TAX BILLS ARE NEVER EASY AND THE- CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. AND THE I. APPRECIATE WRITTEN OUT CITY- I STRONGLY SUPPORT. THIS BILL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- RELATING TO- TEST. HEY EQUITY IN GENERAL BUT ALSO- THEIR TAX POLICY AND- REALLY BE. FRANKLY UNDER TAXATION OF. OF CORPORATIONS IN pWHERE WE JUST SAW. A FORTY PERCENT. REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. TWO YEARS AGO UNDER- THIS PRESIDENT. 40% TAX CUT CORPORATIONS IN THE US THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CUT- AND THIS IS JUST A FRACTION. OF THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW AND YOU SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT BARELY PAY. ANY FEDERAL OUR CORPORATE TAXES ON SO I'M NOT I DON'T. YOUR CORPORATIONS ARE BEING SMOTHERED- BY TAXES IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING I IN THE US AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL IS POSING SOME DRAMATIC. NO TAX BUT IT'S NOT. I THINK IT'S DRAMATIC AS AS SOME HAVE. SUGGESTED. I ALSO WHEN I PLEASE YOU BRING UP THE HOUSING ISSUE AS MY COLLEAGUES SOMEONE'S GOT TIRED OF HEARING ME TALKING ABOUT- TALK ABOUT HOUSING BUT- IT IT IS A HUGE ISSUE AND WE ARE DEFINITELY DRIVING PEOPLE IN THE POVERTY WITH THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FOR DECADES WE'VE NOT BUILT ON HOUSING OR NOW IN THE WHOLE BY MILLIONS OF HOMES. AND SO WE'RE PUSHING PEOPLE IN THE POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT. IS THE LACK OF INCOMES RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN GET THE COST OF HOUSING DOWN TO THE MORE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. CAN AFFORD IT- BUT AS YOU GO LOWER DOWN ON THE ECONOMIC LADDER IT BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER AND IT DOES REQUIRE US TO. DO MORE HOUSING SUBSIDIES FOR LOWER INCOME PEOPLE WHICH I'M HAPPY TO DO AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT AND WE NEED TO DO THAT- BUT WE'RE ALSO AGAIN STEPPING IN TO SUBSIDIZE. HOUSING BECAUSE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE BEING. YOU JUST LEAVE LOW WAGES OF SO MANY WORK. I'M GONNA DATE MYSELF AND ALLOW YOU TO CALCULATE MY AGE- WHEN I WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN YES I'M GOING TO TURN FIFTY NEXT YEAR. WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IN SUBURBAN NEW JERSEY- I WENT I WORKED I WENT TO WORK AT BURGER KING- ON AND- HI. BY THE TIME THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE WAS THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR AYE AYE UP TO THREE FIFTY AN HOUR. AND I WAS LIKE SO HAPPY THAT IT WAS FIFTEEN CENTS A MINIMUM WAGE BUT I WAS ALSO LUCKY THAT I YOU KNOW I LIVED IN THE MIDDLE WITH MY PARENTS IN A MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILY SO FOR ME THAT MONEY YOU KNOW WAS AS A TEENAGER YOU HAVE SOME EXTRA MONEY- I ALSO I HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING WITH ME AT THE TIME WHO WERE NOT IN THAT. POSITION FOR DOING THE SAME JOB THAT I DID FOR THE SAME WAY AIDS BUT THEY WERE SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES YEAH AND- AND IT WAS I KNOW IT WAS TOUGH. FOR THEM THEN. I THEN WORKED FOR CONVENIENCE STORE DURING COLLEGE EIGHTY NINE NINE NINETY ONE I WAS MAKING FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND I BOY I WAS LIKE. THRILLED BUT NOW ALL WORK FAST FORWARD THIRTY YEARS THIRTY THREE YEARS FROM WHEN I WAS WORKING BURKE HANG. AND THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE ANY AT SEVEN TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR. I MEAN NOT EVEN LIKE NOT EVEN INFLATION. FROM THAT THREE THIRTY FIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN LET ALONE THE PROFOUND INCREASES IN THE COST OF LIVING AROUND HOUSING AND FOOD AND EVERYTHING. ELSE THAT ARE REALLY DRAGGING PEOPLE DOWN. AND EVEN THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING HIGHER IN THE MINIMUM WAGE GIVEN THE COST OF LIVING IT IS JUST NOT IS DOES NOT TENABLE FOR PEOPLE SO WE HAVE THIS HUGE PROBLEM OR WE ARE CREATING LIKE A AMONG WORKERS IS LIKE UNDER CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO THAT THEIR WAGES THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY SURVIVE ON THE WAGES THAT THEY'RE BEING PAID. CAN SURVIVE BUT THEY MAY BE LIVING IN A CAR THEY MAY BE CAL SURVEYING MAYBE LIVING FOR FAMILIES I TO A HOME AND WE'VE WE'VE ALLOWED. TO EXIST AND IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE AS A SOCIETY AND ECONOMY HAVE ALLOWED OUR PRIVATE SECTOR TO CREATE THAT KIND OF SITUATION AND SO THIS BILL THE WAY I LOOK AT IT MUST THIS BILL ISN'T A CURE ALL RIGHT WE MORE RESTRUCTURING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO THE PEOPLE CAN CAN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. BUT STARTING TO RE BALANCE ITS TEAM EXECUTIVE PAY THESE OF THE WORKERS AND MAKING A PURCHASE A SMALL FRACTION OF THE 40% TAX CUT THE DONALD TRUMP TO CORPORATE AMERICA I THINK IS SUPER REASONABLE AND SO I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SKINNER WINNER IN A BIG BIRTHDAY COMING UP. YEAH I'M WHERE I'M WAITING FOR MY A. R. P. PACKAGE. NO. VERY GRATEFUL SERVER THOSE PERSONAL WORDS AS WELL SO- SHE DIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'D LIKE TO BE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE DEAN INCIDENTS AN INNOCENT. BRIEF OBSERVATION. OPTICS IS A PART OF THE DEAL. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE. AND THIS WILL BE A PART OF THAT. BUSINESSES ARE NOT FLOCKING TO THIS STATE BUSINESS RELATING. PEOPLE EARLY. I JUST LOST A SON IN LAW AND A DAUGHTER AND TWO GRANDCHILDREN THEIR HIGH RANKING U. S. AND P. S. RANGERS. BUT WHERE THEY LIVE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD EVER BUY A HOUSE. THEN WHAT COLORADO I DON'T BLAME BUT SOME OF THAT IMPACT IS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. LEGISLATURE HAS DRIVEN WHEN THE BUSINESSES AWAY AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE HOMELESS SITUATION THAT WE'RE ALL GRAPPLING WITH. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE AS A STATE CONTINUE AT THE END OF SEND THE SIGNALS THAT CALIFORNIA THERE'S AND I BUSINESS. THIS DOES NOT. ANTI CORPORATE RICH PRESIDENTS. YES THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS WITH THE UC EXECUTIVE PAY AS WELL ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS AT THIS YEAR I DOUBT IT. I JUST THINK THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO KEEP SENDING THE MESSAGES. CHAMBER CALLED A JOB KILLERS. THANK YOU SO I SERIOUS AND VERY GRATEFUL WITH AGASSI CENTER TARA WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO JUST BE ABLE TO OFFER SOME VERY BRIEF. CLOSING WORDS AND INTERNET OVER TO SINNERS SKINNER TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. PRISON FROM SOMEONE- SAY THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE BOTH IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS OPPOSITION. FOR THE ELOQUENT COMMENTS AND TAKING THE TIME TODAY AND WE DO APOLOGIZE BUT THE DELAYS IN THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US. I'M YOU WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SEND A SCAN FOR ADVANCING THIS BILL I'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE WHAT CENTER SKINNER SAID- DURING PARTS OF HER TESTIMONY THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION NOT THE END. AND AS WE JUST HEARD CENTER WINNER STATE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE SILVER BULLET. BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN MAKE. UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE MOST LIKELY NEED TO BE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE LEGISLATION AS IT MOVES FORWARD. AND WOULDN'T ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WAYS CENTER SKINNER AND SHE IS. A STRAIGHT TALKER. HI SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU FEELS IN WHEN THERE NEED TO BE SOME POTENTIAL CHANGES SHE WORKS WITH YOU THIS COLLABORATIVE. AND KNOW THAT WILL BE THE CASE IN THIS SITUATION AS WELL. BOTTOM LINE IS S. INCOME INEQUALITY IS NEVER BEEN GREATER IN THE STATE IN THIS NATION. I AND I A AM NERVOUS. I BELIEVE THIS INCOME INEQUALITY IS GONNA CAUSE TREMENDOUS AND REST. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL THROUGHOUT THE NATION IF WE DON'T TACKLE. INCOME INEQUALITY ESPECIALLY IMPACTS WOMEN. TWO THIRDS OF MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS IN CALIFORNIA I WENT. IN PACKS. MY FAMILY MY MOM WAS A BANK TELLER FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. HER PENSION IN THE BANK AFTER TWO DECADES IS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE BUCKS A MONTH. IF YOU ARE LIVING IN THE BAY AREA. EARNING FIFTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR YOU HAVE TO WORK THREE FULL TIME JOBS. TO BE ABLE TO FOR THE AVERAGE RENT. SKINNER POINTED OUT IN A MEETING THAT I HAD WITH HER. THE REASON WHY THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS IN DEEP POVERTY. IN THE STATE IS BECAUSE WE PAY WOMEN TO LITTLE. WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP. AND THERE'S A GREAT DISPARITY. WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT FEDERAL ACTION ON TAX CUTS. TAX CUTS WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH INCOME INEQUALITY. A FEDERAL MINISTRATION SAID THAT THE AVERAGE MIDDLE INCOME WORKER WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THESE TAX CUTS. THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A 7% RISE IN PAY ON AVERAGE. THUS FAR WE SEEM TO TWO POINT EIGHTY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT. SO I CAN HIT THE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT. GDP I WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP THIS NATION. ARE IT HAS BEEN A MINOR BUMP IN GDP DEPENDING ON THE STATE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO POINT 43% IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING HELPING PROFIT. IT'S NOT HELPING THE BOTTOM LINE WORKERS AND THAT IS YOU TAKE A LOOK AT NONPARTISAN ANALYSIS SOME OF THESE TAXES ARE GONNA BE. ITS RECORD PROFITS. AND IT IS A DEEP CONCERN. ARE WE PERFECT IN HERE ARE WE PERFECT HERE IN CALIFORNIA YEAH. BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE INCREDIBLE STRIDES AN ISSUE OF INCOME INEQUALITY IN BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TOOL. ARE BOX TO DO SO. SO WITH THAT. I KNOW THE SENATE SKINNER IS GONNA CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BILL. BUT TOBE ABLE TO IMPROVE IT SHE IS DONE YEOMAN'S WORK. AS FAR AT THIS IS. ABOUT FOUR YEARS IN THE MAKING I'M IN TEARS CAN EVEN TOOK A PAUSE ON THIS BILL. A COUPLE YEARS AGO. ALL RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK THE ISSUE. WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTED TODAY AND I IN TURN OVER SENATE SKINNER FOR HER CLOSING COMMENTS BEFORE THAT THAT MR ME CAN I MAKE A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO RULES COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH MOTIONS ON THE FOR PRICING HERTZBERG. THERE'S GONNA. CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- ST STE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FACT THAT IT IS- BADLY AMONGST CALIFORNIANS IS OUR WOMEN. THAT ARE PRIMARILY IN THESE. SERVICE JOBS THAT ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST PAYING JOBS AND THOSE SAME WOMEN ARE SUPPORTING CHILDREN IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T-HAVE. TWO PARENT FAMILY SUPPORTING CHILDREN IT'S JUST THAT. THE HIGHEST RATE OF POVERTY IN OUR STATE IS AMONGST WOMEN WITH CHILDREN AND THUS CHILDREN. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU POINTED THAT OUT. AND WHILE THE BILL'S NOT DESIGNED SOLELY AND ONLY YOUR SURGICALLY TARGETED TO THAT POPULATION ONLY IT REALLY IS TRYING TO. AS I'VE ALREADY INDICATED. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE AS A STATE RECONCILE. THAT WE'VE HAD PHENOMENAL JOB GROWTH. OUR RESIDENTS ARE WORKING. WE DO NOT HAVE IT. THERE'S STILL SOME UNEMPLOYMENT BUT BASICALLY NOTHING LIKE WE'VE HAD N THE PAST. IN YET TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE IN POVERTY. SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT. HOW DO WE DESIGN. POLICIES THAT HELP ADDRESS IT. WE ARE USING. OUR GENERAL FUND SO TAXPAYER MONEY. WE ARE WE'VE CREATED A CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX AND WE'RE INCREASING OUR THE POSITIVE GENERAL FUND REVENUES INTO IT. WE ARE. EXPANDING THE SUBSIDIZATION OF CHILDCARE. WE ARE EXPANDING WITH EACH BUDGET IN EVEN THE BUDGET ARE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED TO US- JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. I'M MORE MONEY TO SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MORE MONEY FOR EMERGENCY RENT ASSISTANCE AND SUCH. ALL OF THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY THAT PRIMARILY WILL GO TO WORKING CALIFORNIANS. WORKING CALIFORNIA TO DO NOT. EARN ENOUGH TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND YET. THEY'RE IN I AM NOT TRAINED I. TRYING TO MAKE COMPANIES BAD OF PLAYERS OR MAKE IT THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY PAID WELL AND EVEN A C. E. O. WHOSE COMPENSATED IN THE- MILLIONS. RATHER I WANT TO TRY TO SEE HOW. WE CAN DESIGN A STRUCTURE SET THOSE CORPORATIONS AT THE TIME THAT THEY'RE RECORDING RECORD PROFITS AND PAYING THEIR CEO'S MORE THAN EVER. WILL ALSO INCREASE THE PAID OF THEIR WORKERS. AND CERTAINLY MINIMUM WAGE IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT. AND BUT IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE SAME ENTITIES THAT CAME BEFORE US OPPOSING THIS BILL NOT ALL A FEW OF THEM WERE WE WERE ABLE TO CUT A DEAL AROUND MINIMUM WAGE. BY IN LARGE OPPOSE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES SO THAT'S THE KIND OF DILEMMA WERE IN THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. AND I WILL INTERESTINGLY POINT OUT THE POLLS ACROSS THE NATION SHOW THAT AMERICANS BY 80% AND HIGHER. FUEL THAT C. E. O. PAY HAS BECOME EXORBITANT AND FEEL THAT. I'M REGULAR WORKERS PAID BETTER AND THAT IS POLLS ACROSS THE US IN NUMBERS OF 80% AND HIGHER. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE HAD SUCH A VERY HEALTHY DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE OTHER INPUT ON DESIGNING SUCH THINGS ARE AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE CORPORATIONS TO PAY EMPLOYEES BETTER. AND SORT OF EQUALIZE THAT GAP BETWEEN. HI PAVE THE EXECUTIVE SUITE AND THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE IS A GOOD STRATEGY BUT I AM VERY OPEN TO LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE THE MOTION AN ATMOSPHERE I'VE- THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER SKINNER CLOSING COMMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY THE MAJORITY LEADERS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO RULES LET'S GO TO THE ROLL CALL MISSING JUST RECALL THE PLEASE.
